<h3 id="c9">敬告上海市民 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>由於前數日米價的暴漲，使本已嚴重的物價問題，更見嚴厲起來。因此，大部分上海市民（除了奸商市儈）的生活，陷入走頭無路的苦境，大有「上海不易居」之慨！我們深感這種情勢的迫切，所以對於食米問題，曾三論其對策，建議治標治本辦法，期待於市政府及米統會當局酌量採納，　此亂風。然而，我們也不能不向上海市民進一言，以諜自善之道的參考。</p>
<p>物價問題的發生，（一）由於物價缺乏；（二）由於通貨膨脹；（三）由於囤積居奇；（四）由於生產停滯；（五）由於交通運輸不暢。過去的物價飛漲，其因素大致沒有脫出上述五種，可是，這次食米飛漲的主要原因，是本市奸商與一部份縣區郊區的奸商勾結，從中操縱所造成的。如此，物價問題，到了目前，已成了驚弓之鳥，只要一點風擊，即可成爲驚波駭浪，不可遏止，予奸商大肆活動的機會，而滿足他們殺人不見血的暴利慾望，使大多數市民掙扎於饑餓綫上。這種現象，是更具體的說明統制經濟政策與統制經濟機構的缺點，助長了奸商投機操縱之風，以至於無法無天，將妨礙到統制政策的推行，客觀上起着擾亂大東亞戰爭後方經濟安定的作用。所以統制經濟政策的改善，統制機構的調整，配給制度適合實際需要等等，亟需求其實現。另一方面說明上海市民的不鎭靜，輕信謠言，爲謠言所迷惑，而慌亂起來，這樣中了奸商米蠢虫的毒計，反把自己縛在高物價的樁子上。因此，我們希望上海市民，應採取鎭靜態度，盼望當局，急籌食米對策。對於查有實據的奸商，處以最嚴厲罪刑，以收殺一嚴百之效。但是，必須上海市民協助政府檢舉擾害民生的奸商，纔能肅清這批奸商；也惟有我們全上海市民對這批奸商鳴鼓圍攻之，十手指之，十目視之，纔能斂跡；也惟有我們大家起來維護自己的利益，纔能不被人類中的害虫所蠢蝕。</p>
<p>我們南方是魚米之鄉，在生活上食的方面，一向以米爲主要食料，甚至在浙江，湖南，江西有每天三餐必須吃飯的習慣。一般社會上認爲「吃粥」是窮人家的生活，可恥的事，背着鄰居啜粥，而猶須飾稱吃的飯。食米飯，在中國人的心目中成了惟一養身的食料。如果我們根據科學衛生來分析，米在營養上的價値是低微的。南方人吃飯必須很豐美的菜肴來佐　，北方人吃麺，吃雜糧，不用什麽菜肴，一碟子辣椒就吃了一頓飯，身體反比南方人强健，這點就足以證明米的營養價値如何了。</p>
<p>上海人有吃麺食吃不飽的心理，近年來也</p>
<p>從上列表中的分析，營養最豐富的是我們上海人當作　鳥的小米，其次是麥，一向被人輕視爲玉米麫（即苞米粉）的營養還超過了大米和白麫。這樣，我們搭吃雜糧，並不減少身體上所需的營養，明乎此，可以不惴惴於大米的貴賤，另謀果腹之道。同時，還須指出每天一飯一粥頗合乎攝生之道，不要以爲窮而出此，即使富有者，囤米充足，不妨吃一餐粥，一方節約消耗，造福社會，另一方也可强身延年有人改吃麵食了，這不能說這種心理已不普遍，是爲不得已而吃此的。如果再進一步要求摻吃雜糧，眞會想起吃糠的趙五娘，難以下咽。所以米一漲價，大家惶恐起來，生命立刻受到威脅似的。所以，我們提倡搭吃雜糧，不但減少米的需要，而且營養價値較高。一個普通成人，（居於溫帶而不勞力）每日需要，按半斤食物之營養價値列表如次：</p>
<p>最後，我們也盼望上海市內的奸商蠢虫，從此有所反省。弄到上海市民都要哭的時候，決不會讓你們一家去笑，國家的法律，也決不會永遠饒恕你們，終有一天會與其一路哭，不如一家哭的。在私人道德上講，我們也勸勸你們替後代子孫積些德。現代人都不相信迷信，因果報應，不是沒有的。書云「天作孽，猶可活，自作孽，不可逭，」請三復斯言。</p>

<p>（二）油糧統制委員會</p>
<p>（一）改組經過</p>
<p>政府爲確立戰時經濟政策，實施物資統制，自民國三十二年三月以來，次第設立各統制機關，以司其事，油糧有關特需民用，爲謀供求相應，亦在統制之列，於是年六月間，設立油糧專業委員會，爲全國商業統制總會下之一部門，迨至本年七月，政府調整物資統制機構，爲將油糧專業委員會，改乃油糧統制委員會，由行政院指派華方主任委員一人，副主任委員一，常務委員三人，委員四人，聘任日方副主任委員一人常務委員二人，委員三人，於本年八月十五日正式改組成立，仍受全國商業統制總會之指導監督，繼續辦理油糧統制管理事宜</p>
<p>（二）內部組織</p>
<p>本會內部組織，除設主任委員一人，副主任委員二人，常務委員五人，委員七人外，並設秘書長一人，秘書若干人，成立秘書室，此外分設三處十科，秘書室分總務，文書，企劃三科，第一處分收買，運輸儲管二科，第二處分配給，工塲管理二科，第三處分審核，資金，財務三科，各處設處長副處長各一人，各科設科長副科長各一人，以下並設辦事員助理員各若干人，分別辦理各該處科事務。另設專員若干人，辦理特別指定之會務，在外並擇定地區，設立辦事處。</p>
<p>（三）委員及重要職員姓名</p>
<p>主任委員陳子　。副主任委員楊河清，栗本寅治。常務委員符前耕，凌養吾，陳世德，松本三朗，高橋睿。委員何權生，謝子佳，陳湛如，潘景賢，片野曹太郎，野崎讓，兒玉長次郎。專員蔣石稚，查士元，鈴木稔，田原昍二。秘書長潘景賢（兼）。第一處處長陳世德（兼）。副處長松本三朗（兼）第二處處長凌養吾（兼）。副處長高橋睿（兼）。第三處處長符前耕（兼）。副處長鈴木稔（兼）。秘書火雪明，狄疇，金湛慮，陸景介，王文津，章孟威，狄仲一，郭令之，市川佐吉。總務科科長王志仁，副科長太田實。文書科科長火雪明（兼），副科長古屋敷宗后衛。企劃科科長祝天齡，副科長黑田正吾。收買科科長陳世芳，副科長行司喜造。運輸儲管科長徐百階，副科長（未定）。配給科科長周紹泰，副科長小山清一。工塲管理科科長狄仲一（兼），副科長加藤喜好。審核科科查士元（兼），副科長田原昍二（兼）。資金科科長葛振，副科長藤本智。財務科科長張紹　，副科長田原昍二（兼）。蘇州辦事處主任張學明，副主任徐映奎。常州辦事處主任魏壽齡，副主任謝仁　。無錫辦事處主任謝岑勛，副主任張詠南。</p>
<p>（四）工作舉要</p>
<p>一，油糧統制管理方案之擬訂　各種油糧一部份因產自華中，一部份尙須仰給於華北各地，產區既廣，種類復多，應如何施以統制管理，如何以謀供求平衡，如何誘導生產之增加，如何促進營運之圓滑，其推行之重要，自不待言，前在油糧專業委員會時代，雖經行政院公佈油糧統一管理暫行辦法，以資遵行，惟自經年以來，因省區之分拓，與本會之改設成立，以及事實上各項情况之更變，對於前訂辦法，亟有修正必要，當經本會迭加研討，另行擬具油糧統制管理暫行辦法，以作本會業務中心方案，現巳送由全國商業統制總會，轉呈行政院核准旅行。</p>
<p>二，收買油糧及資金之籌措　本會改組成立後，對於收買各地區之油糧工作，仍繼續積極推進。蠢豆業已收買完成，近値棉籽登塲，爲充裕製油原料起見，擬在上海及江北兩地，儘量收購，並向江北東臺附近地區收買植物油，以供上海市民食用之需，關於雜糧方面，爲苞米，黃豆，高梁等類，亦赴上海附近及南通，蚌埠，蕪湖，安慶，南京，揚州，南通各地區積極收買，均經本會訂有詳細計劃，逐漸分別實施。</p>
<p>三，舉辦上海區食用油存貨登記及買賣登記　本會改組成立之始，適値滬市物價賤踴，食用油價，因隨而增長，影響民生，實非淺鮮，本會職責所在，爲防杜投機囤積起見，爰經先後制定「上海地區食用油存貨買賣臨時登記規則」，及「上海區食用油管理暫行辦法」，呈率全國商業統制總會核准施行。</p>
<p>四，據收　　油糧移動許可事務　依照物資統制調整綱要之規定，各項統制物資之移動許可事務，應由各統制機關自行辦理，油糧移動許可事務，已往原係隸歸全國商業統制總會綜合辦理，現因調整物資機構關係，遂於本年九月一日起由總會劃交本會接辦，所有一切手續，仍均遵照原訂辦法，繼續辦理。</p>
<p>五，配給上海民需食油　關於上海市民需食油之配給，過去係由中支那軍票交換用物資配給組合撥交上海食用油同　批發處辦理。目前油糧專業委員會於上年成立之後，該組合及批發先後解散，此項配給辦至第六期而停止，即由油糧專業委員會從第七期接辦，並督導上海油糧同業組成上海食用油統配處，承辦經配事宜，接續按期配給，本會改組成立時，前油糧專業委員會正在辦理第十一期之發配手續，所有該期配給未了事宜，統由本會接辦完成。現在本會方正發配第十二期民需食油，尙未結束。又查滬市食油，向賴滿州華北以及蘇淮等地區輸入，現因限於環境，來源短少，故每期每人祗能配給四兩，總數計爲四百三十餘公噸，按諸實際需要，僅敷十分之二三，近來更因運輸困難，以及各處食油來源銳減，本會不得不另謀開源之法，已向江北及常錫等地採辦，以期補充配給，而應民用。</p>
<p>六，分設各地辦事處　本會爲便於實施統制管理强化收買事宜，經常務委員會議決，擇定南京，蘇州，常州，無錫，安慶，蕪湖，蚌埠，揚州，鎭江，南通，各地區設立辦事處，並經聘任張學明爲蘇州辦事處主任，徐映奎爲副主任，魏壽齡爲常州辦事處主任，謝仁鋮爲副主任，謝岑勛爲無錫辦事處主任，張詠南爲副主任，先行從事組織，不日即可正式成立，至其他辦事處，亦正尅速籌設，　選人員，可望於短時期內，一一實現。</p>

<p>市民防空本部據日陸海軍報道部發表：昨（十九）日晨駐渝敵美航空部隊B29型轟炸機十餘架，自駐渝內地基地起飛，在蘇北各區活動，繼而至下午侵入滬境，在極高度上空，無目標向滬南平民住宅區濫施轟炸，死傷無事平民百餘人，民房數十幢，是項無人道之轟炸，全市民衆，頗表憤懣。市民防空本部對被難災黎，無辜遭殃，極表同情，同時預料嗣後隨時有被襲之可能，故市民對防空設備及措置，當加緊週密及熟練，尤其對避難更須亟力注意，以免無謂犧性。又於上月二十一日本市被襲以來，今次尚爲第一次，查上月二十一日本市被炸後，即有本月八日繼續被炸之流言，結果已證實全屬無稽之謠。市民絕不可聽信，須鎭靜應付，至於散播謠言之不法奸宄，當局將從嚴查辦。</p>

<p>「臘鼓聲催，歲聿云暮。」陽歷年關，近在眼前，上海各業商行，都在準備結帳，這一年中，無論大小廠商，大小百榮，家家都有盈餘，帳面上的紀錄，一定是百萬，千萬，爲數可觀。姑不論其籌碼與物資的比例，是否相稱，但盈餘總是盈餘。依公司眾程，盈餘除股東紅利及公積金外，應該分配給董監事及職工，作爲酬勞，而主持分配的大權，是操在董事會方面。如今，我們有一點小小的要求，便是懇求各業廠商的董事會諸公，提出盈餘項下一小部份，作爲「社會福利金」，數目不拘多少，千分之一也好，百分之一更好；而在「社會福利金」項下，最關重要的，便是爲國家造就人材的「助學金」。這件事我們請求工商界董事會諸公，千萬不要忽略，千萬不要推却！這就是以「集體」的力量，救濟靑年失學最好的方法。比個人的力量，偉大得多了。像本報負責的五千優秀淸寒子弟的「助學金」，爲數至少在三千萬元以上，勸募的責任，要大家來負担，大家來出錢，纔可以完成「助學」的使命。請讀者諸君，進而敎之，感幸何如！</p>

As of the 15th, the battle line sees advances and retreats, with fierce fighting still underway in the northern suburbs of Ormoc. Furthermore, the Japanese positions between Albeuela and Damulaan are proving a major obstacle to the enemy's advance. The enemy's 7th Division, attempting to move north from Bapa, has been completely stalled near Damulaan, severing all their land routes of communication. The enemy is also experiencing anxiety and difficulty with their naval transport. On the other hand, Japanese units have secured the Buluan and San Pablo airfields, strengthening their positions. Through multiple day and night assaults and charges, they have attacked the enemy airfield at Talak, causing alarm and chaos among the enemy forces.</p>

<p>Chungking News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: On the 19th, US Air Force planes stationed in Chungking, approximately 30 to 40 B-29s, attacked the vicinity of Omura City in Kyushu, Japan, from the vicinity of Chengdu. Simultaneously, two or three planes attacked Yamaguchi Prefecture and the Kurahata area. Those attacking the vicinity of Omura City dropped bombs from high altitude, while those attacking the Kurahata area of Yamaguchi Prefecture did not drop bombs. Due to the comprehensive and robust Japanese air defense, losses were minimal. The results of the battle are currently under investigation. Furthermore, when approximately 70 enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Nagoya on the 18th, they were intercepted by the Japanese. According to an announcement by the Imperial Headquarters on the 19th, 17 aircraft were shot down and over 20 were damaged. Furthermore, this is only the confirmed result by the Japanese side. In reality, it is feared that the number exceeds 40. It is expected that approximately 70% of the attacking enemy aircraft did not return to their bases due to the interception by the Japanese air defense forces. The Japanese side lost only six aircraft in this battle, some of which appear to have collided with enemy aircraft, and the matter is currently under investigation. Furthermore, in today's results, Japanese anti-aircraft units shot down two aircraft and destroyed eight aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e9">A Word to the Citizens of Shanghai <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Due to the recent surge in rice prices, the already serious problem of commodity prices has become even more severe. As a result, the lives of most Shanghai citizens (except for profiteering merchants) have fallen into a desperate situation, with a sense of "Shanghai is not easy to live in!" We deeply feel the urgency of this situation. Therefore, we have discussed the countermeasures for the rice problem three times, suggesting both stopgap and fundamental solutions, hoping that the municipal government and the Rice Control Association will consider adopting them in order to curb this chaotic trend. However, we also have to say a word to the citizens of Shanghai as a reference for self-improvement.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the price problem is due to (1) a lack of goods; (2) inflation; (3) hoarding and speculation; (4) stagnation of production; and (5) poor transportation. The rapid rise in prices in the past was generally due to these five factors. However, the main reason for the recent surge in rice prices is the collusion between profiteering merchants in the city and some profiteering merchants in the suburban areas of the county, who manipulated the market. In this way, the price problem has now become a frightened bird. As long as there is a little disturbance, it can become a shocking wave, unstoppable, giving profiteering merchants the opportunity to act unscrupulously and satisfy their bloody greed, leaving the majority of citizens struggling on the edge of starvation. This phenomenon more specifically illustrates the shortcomings of the controlled economy policy and the controlled economy institutions, which have fueled the speculation and manipulation of profiteering merchants, to the point of lawlessness, which will hinder the implementation of the controlled policy and objectively play a role in disrupting the economic stability of the rear area of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, improvements in the controlled economy policy, adjustments to the controlled institutions, and a distribution system that meets actual needs are urgently needed. On the other hand, it shows that the citizens of Shanghai are not calm and easily believe rumors, being misled by rumors and panicking. In this way, they fall into the trap of profiteering merchants and tie themselves to the stake of high prices. Therefore, we hope that the citizens of Shanghai will adopt a calm attitude and hope that the authorities will quickly devise a rice policy. For profiteering merchants who are found to have solid evidence, the most severe punishment should be imposed to achieve the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. However, the citizens of Shanghai must assist the government in exposing the profiteering merchants who disrupt the people's livelihood in order to eliminate this group of profiteering merchants. Only when all of us Shanghai citizens encircle and attack this group of profiteering merchants, point our fingers at them, and watch them with our ten eyes, can they restrain their behavior. Only when we all stand up to protect our own interests can we not be eaten away by the pests of humanity.</p>
<p>Our south is a land of fish and rice. In terms of diet, rice has always been the main food. Even in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi, there is a habit of eating rice for three meals a day. In general society, "eating porridge" is considered the life of poor people, a shameful thing, sipping porridge behind the neighbor's back, and still having to pretend to be eating rice. Eating rice has become the only nutritious food in the minds of Chinese people. If we analyze it from the perspective of science and hygiene, the nutritional value of rice is low. Southerners must have very rich dishes to accompany their rice. Northerners eat noodles and coarse grains, without any dishes, just a plate of chili peppers for a meal, and their bodies are stronger than those of southerners. This is enough to prove the nutritional value of rice.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai have the mentality that they cannot get full from eating noodles. In recent years, some people have started to eat noodles, but this cannot be said that this mentality is no longer prevalent, but rather they are forced to eat it. If we ask them to mix in coarse grains, they will really think of Zhao Wuniang eating bran, and it will be difficult to swallow. Therefore, when rice prices rise, everyone panics, as if their lives are immediately threatened. Therefore, we advocate mixing in coarse grains, which not only reduces the need for rice, but also has higher nutritional value. An average adult (living in a temperate zone and not doing manual labor) needs the following nutritional value per day, according to the nutritional value table of half a catty of food:</p>
<p>From the analysis in the table above, the most nutritious is millet, which we Shanghai people regard as bird food. The second is wheat. Corn flour, which has always been despised, has more nutritional value than rice and white flour. In this way, we can get enough to eat by mixing in coarse grains, without reducing the nutrition needed by the body. Understanding this, we can stop worrying about the price of rice and find other ways to fill our stomachs. At the same time, it must be pointed out that one rice meal and one porridge meal a day is quite in line with the way to maintain health. Don't think that this is because you are poor. Even the rich, with sufficient rice, may as well eat a meal of porridge, on the one hand to save consumption and benefit society, and on the other hand to strengthen the body and prolong life.</p>
<p>Finally, we also hope that the profiteering pests in Shanghai will reflect on themselves from now on. When the citizens of Shanghai are all crying, they will definitely not let your family laugh alone, and the laws of the country will definitely not forgive you forever. One day, it will be better to cry alone than to cry all the way. In terms of private morality, we also advise you to accumulate some virtue for your future generations. Modern people do not believe in superstition, but karma is not non-existent. The book says, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be escaped, but calamities of one's own making are inescapable." Please think about this repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Overview of the Work of the Five Control Associations After the Reorganization of the Commercial Control Association (II) <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(II) Oil and Grain Control Committee</p>
<p>(1) Reorganization Process</p>
<p>In order to establish wartime economic policies and implement material controls, the government has successively established various control agencies since March of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] to manage these matters. Oil and grain are related to special and civilian needs. In order to ensure a balance between supply and demand, they were also placed under control. Therefore, in June of that year, the Oil and Grain Professional Committee was established as a department under the National Commercial Control Association. In July of this year, the government adjusted the material control agencies, transforming the Oil and Grain Professional Committee into the Oil and Grain Control Committee. The Executive Yuan appointed one Chinese chairman, one vice-chairman, three standing committee members, and four committee members. One Japanese vice-chairman, two standing committee members, and three committee members were appointed. The reorganized committee was officially established on August 15 of this year, and continued to be guided and supervised by the National Commercial Control Association to continue handling oil and grain control management matters.</p>
<p>(2) Internal Organization</p>
<p>The internal organization of this committee, in addition to one chairman, two vice-chairmen, five standing committee members, and seven committee members, also includes one secretary-general and several secretaries, forming a secretariat. In addition, there are three divisions and ten sections. The secretariat is divided into three sections: general affairs, documents, and planning. The first division is divided into two sections: purchasing, transportation, and storage. The second division is divided into two sections: distribution, and factory management. The third division is divided into three sections: review, funding, and finance. Each division has a director and a deputy director, and each section has a section chief and a deputy section chief, with several clerks and assistants below them, respectively handling the affairs of each division and section. In addition, several specialists are appointed to handle specially assigned committee affairs, and offices are established in selected areas.</p>

<p>(4) Summary of Work</p>
<p>1. Formulation of Oil and Grain Control Management Plans: A portion of various oils and grains are produced in Central China, and a portion still needs to be supplied from various parts of North China. Since the production areas are wide and the types are numerous, how to implement control management, how to seek a balance between supply and demand, how to guide the increase in production, and how to promote the smooth operation are all undoubtedly important. In the past, during the era of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the Executive Yuan promulgated temporary measures for unified oil and grain management to be followed. However, since then, due to the expansion of provinces and regions, the reorganization and establishment of this committee, and changes in the actual situation, it is necessary to revise the previously established measures. After repeated discussions by this committee, temporary measures for oil and grain control management have been formulated as the central plan for the committee's work, and have now been submitted to the National Commercial Control Association and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>2. Purchasing Oil and Grain and Raising Funds: After the reorganization and establishment of this committee, the work of purchasing oil and grain in various regions has continued to be actively promoted. The purchasing of silkworm beans has been completed. Recently, the cotton seed season has begun. In order to enrich the raw materials for oil production, it is planned to purchase as much as possible in Shanghai and Jiangbei, and to purchase vegetable oil in the area near Dongtai in Jiangbei to supply the needs of Shanghai citizens for edible oil. Regarding miscellaneous grains, such as corn, soybeans, and sorghum, they are also actively purchased in various regions near Shanghai and Nantong, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Nantong. This committee has formulated detailed plans and is gradually implementing them separately.</p>
<p>3. Conducting Inventory Registration and Sales Registration of Edible Oil in Shanghai: At the beginning of the reorganization and establishment of this committee, it coincided with the soaring prices of commodities in Shanghai, and the price of edible oil increased accordingly, which had a profound impact on people's livelihood. It is the responsibility of this committee to prevent speculation and hoarding. Therefore, it formulated the "Temporary Registration Rules for Inventory Sales of Edible Oil in Shanghai" and the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Edible Oil in Shanghai" in succession, which were submitted to the National Commercial Control Association for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>4. Handling of Oil and Grain Movement Permits: According to the provisions of the Outline for the Adjustment of Material Control, the handling of movement permits for various controlled materials should be handled by the control agencies themselves. In the past, the handling of oil and grain movement permits was originally affiliated to the National Commercial Control Association for comprehensive handling. Now, due to the relationship of adjusting the material institutions, the association transferred it to this committee on September 1 of this year. All procedures are still followed according to the original measures and continue to be handled.</p>
<p>5. Distributing Edible Oil for Civilian Needs in Shanghai: In the past, the distribution of edible oil for the needs of Shanghai citizens was handled by the China Expeditionary Army Yen Exchange Materials Distribution Association, which allocated it to the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association for wholesale. Currently, after the Oil and Grain Professional Committee was established last year, the association and wholesale have been dissolved one after another. This distribution was stopped after the sixth period, and the Oil and Grain Professional Committee took over from the seventh period, and supervised the Shanghai Oil and Grain Industry to form the Shanghai Edible Oil Unified Distribution Office to undertake the matters of distribution. The distribution was continued on a regular basis. When this committee was reorganized and established, the former Oil and Grain Professional Committee was handling the distribution procedures for the eleventh period, and all unfinished matters of the distribution of that period were taken over and completed by this committee. Now this committee is distributing the twelfth period of civilian edible oil, which has not yet ended. In addition, Shanghai's edible oil has always relied on imports from Manchuria, North China, and Suhuai. Now, due to environmental constraints, the source is scarce, so only four taels per person can be distributed each period, totaling more than 430 metric tons, which is only about 20% to 30% of the actual needs. Recently, due to transportation difficulties and the sharp reduction in the source of edible oil in various places, this committee has had to find other ways to increase the source, and has procured from Jiangbei and Changxi to supplement the distribution and meet civilian needs.</p>
<p>6. Establishing Offices in Various Places: In order to facilitate the implementation of control management and strengthen purchasing, this committee resolved through the Standing Committee to select Nanjing, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nantong to establish offices. Zhang Xueming was appointed as the director of the Suzhou Office, Xu Yingkui as the deputy director, Wei Shuling as the director of the Changzhou Office, Xie Ren [omitted character] as the deputy director, Xie Cenxun as the director of the Wuxi Office, and Zhang Yongnan as the deputy director, to start organizing first. They will be officially established soon. The other offices are also being prepared as soon as possible, and personnel are being selected, and it is hoped that they will be realized one by one in a short period of time.</p>

The German forces are gradually improving their position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency report: Over the past 48 hours, the large-scale German offensive between Trier and Monschau has expanded to a broad front in northern Luxembourg. German mobile units and People's Grenadiers have broken through the resistance of U.S. tank units in the Luxembourg area in local engagements. German forces are now approaching the Luxembourg-Belgium border. An attempt by U.S. forces to attack the German flank from the southwest was unsuccessful and resulted in heavy losses. On the northern front, German armored units are rapidly advancing towards U.S.-held areas, having penetrated the Malmedy area. German forces have advanced several kilometers along a 100-kilometer front. The German action caught the U.S. forces by surprise, so the U.S. defenses only became strong 10 to 12 kilometers behind the original line. German military authorities stated last night that the German offensive is continuing, with German artillery, tanks, paratroopers, engineers, anti-aircraft units, and the air force participating in the operation. In the initial phase of the offensive, the German forces have already achieved significant gains, with the goals for the entire day being fully achieved in just a few hours. After creating a gap, German forces immediately poured in continuously, so the territory gained by the German forces in 36 hours is equivalent to the U.S. advance around the Aachen area.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency report: On Monday night, anti-Axis aircraft violated Swedish southern airspace.

<h3 id="e19">Situation Stable in Northern Hungary <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency report: The situation in the northern Hungarian front is now stable. German and Hungarian allied forces have not only established a strong line but have also broken the Soviet forces' initiative in several areas. West of Eger in northwestern Hungary, strong positions have been built, and mines and other obstacles are impeding Soviet advances in and along the Ipeľ Valley. German positions southeast of Jesenské have also been significantly improved. German forces in Jesenské and Basto have regained their original positions. In the area north of Miskolc where enemy forces have infiltrated, Soviet forces continue to advance northwest, but have failed to break through Slovak territory. The battlefront near Budapest remains very quiet, with Soviet pressure having shifted to the north. However, large-scale movements by Soviet forces on the southern Hungarian front indicate that a general offensive is imminent.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Over Ten Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai, Repelled; Air Defense Headquarters Urges Intensified Air Defense <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Army and Navy Press Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Department announced: "On the morning of December 19th, over ten enemy B-29 bombers were active in the northern Jiangsu area. Around 10:20 AM, one aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area, flying reconnaissance. Subsequently, from around 12:20 PM, over ten enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed Wusong, Pudong, and the outskirts of Shanghai from high altitude, continuing for two hours, before being repelled by our air force. Several civilian houses were damaged in this air raid, and fires broke out in several locations. Our defense forces and civilian air defense forces actively carried out rescue operations and quickly extinguished the fires. Details are under investigation. As of now, approximately one Japanese person has been identified among the Chinese casualties.</p>
<p>Announcement by the Civilian Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters, based on an announcement by the Japanese Army and Navy Press Department, stated: Yesterday morning (19th), over ten B-29 bombers of the enemy American air force, based in Chongqing, took off from their inland base in Chongqing and were active in various districts of northern Jiangsu. Subsequently, they intruded into the Shanghai area in the afternoon and indiscriminately bombed civilian residential areas in southern Shanghai from a very high altitude, resulting in over one hundred civilian casualties and dozens of civilian houses destroyed. The inhumane bombing has aroused considerable resentment among the citizens of the city. The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters expresses deep sympathy for the victims and innocent civilians and, at the same time, anticipates the possibility of future attacks at any time. Therefore, citizens should intensify and perfect their air defense equipment and measures, especially paying close attention to taking shelter to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Furthermore, this is the first attack since the city was attacked on the 21st of last month. After the bombing of the city on the 21st of last month, there was a rumor that it would continue to be bombed on the 8th of this month, which has been proven to be completely groundless. Citizens must not believe it and should remain calm. The authorities will severely investigate and punish illegal elements spreading rumors.</p>
<p>Southern District Suffers Blind Bombing Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft that attacked Shanghai on the 19th, with enemy American pilots seeking their own safety, resorted to despicable means, carrying out blind bombing from high altitudes of over 10,000 meters, subjecting the civilian residential areas of the Southern District to a cruel baptism of explosions. The incendiary bombs they dropped, presumably, were the "holy water" sprinkled by the enemy American devils because they deemed the heads of us East Asians noble. The logic of those who do not recognize people of color as human beings is evident here. We Chinese people, who love peaceful lives, are being deprived by this cruel giant hand. Are these dozens of lives not human beings? For whom are they subjected to the baptism of iron and fire, dying tragically amid screams and bloodshed, while their dozens of houses are completely destroyed, and many more are more than half destroyed? Listen to the cries of the innocent people who have lost their homes and loved ones. Their inner anger and curses are enough to shock these brutal demons, and the despicable means of the enemy Americans are evident here. The enemy American planes have repeatedly massacred civilians. It is hoped that the simple and honest Chinese citizens will have a deeper understanding of this. Furthermore, among the incendiary bombs dropped by the enemy Americans on the 19th, one hit a nursing home run by French Catholics. Fortunately, no major damage occurred in the nursing home. The fact that the enemy Americans dare to be so reckless proves that they will undoubtedly not escape the severe punishment of the gods. The American air force stationed in Chongqing had its strength weakened in mid-November due to constant attacks by the Japanese air force. After being resupplied, it regained its strength and began its foolish attempts to disrupt production and wage psychological warfare against the Japanese. This bombing by the enemy is entirely to cover up their defeats in Taiwan, the Philippines, and the seas. In the future, enemy aircraft will continue to carry out similar raids. It is hoped that citizens will pay more attention to air defense.</p>

<p>The Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Reserve Bank previously discovered a black market for the Joint Reserve Notes.

In order to prevent this malpractice and eliminate the black market for the Joint Reserve Notes, it temporarily suspended remittance business to North China and sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth about the arbitrage. Now that the investigation has been completed, it has resumed exchange with North China. However, in order to prevent malpractices, applicants for exchange must undergo careful review, and only those with legitimate business uses will be approved for exchange.</p>

The situation is very enthusiastic. It is reported that the Committee, noting the large number of passengers traveling to and from various water and land transportation hubs in the city and the frequent congestion, plans to mobilize youth on a selected date to assist in maintaining traffic. The details are still being planned.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Over-the-Counter Transactions at Stock Exchange Under Investigation by Authorities <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Yi Da Company, broker No. 66 of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, recently suffered a huge loss due to short selling by clients under the name of Gong Da Securities Company. Unable to settle the accounts, it unilaterally closed the positions at noon on the 16th of this month (Saturday), causing an uproar. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Land Supervisor of the Ministry of Finance's Securities Exchange and Zhang Weiru, director of the Securities Exchange. According to Zhang, brokers have recently been violating regulations and engaging in illegal over-the-counter transactions. The Gong Da Company incident is just one of them. In fact, there are no fewer than 20 brokers privately engaging in over-the-counter transactions. The Exchange, in addition to reporting this incident to Land Congzu, the Exchange's supervisor, has first suspended the company's trading privileges and has also sent personnel to investigate the truth. Land Supervisor Land also stated: I have already ordered the broker to hand over all account books. A portion was handed over this morning and is awaiting investigation. As for the investigation steps, it has now been decided that this office will send personnel to jointly review the account books with personnel from the Exchange to clarify the truth. Over-the-counter transactions not only evade the Exchange's handling fees but also evade national taxes, which is not comparable to ordinary incidents. According to my prediction, this matter may involve other brokers. In short, this incident is a warning to those who illegally engage in over-the-counter transactions. I am determined to strictly ban over-the-counter transactions in accordance with the law to prevent the public from being deceived and losing money.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Hoping that Industries and Businesses Will Provide Surplus to Aid Students; Willing to Jointly Undertake the Mission of "Aiding Students" <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>"The sound of the New Year's drum urges, the year is coming to an end." The Western New Year is just around the corner. Shanghai's various industries and businesses are preparing to close their accounts. This year, regardless of the size of the factory or the scale of the business, every household has a surplus. The records on the books must be in the millions, even tens of millions, a considerable sum. Regardless of whether the ratio of chips to materials is commensurate, the surplus is always a surplus. According to the company's regulations, in addition to shareholder dividends and public reserve funds, the surplus should be distributed to directors, supervisors, and employees as remuneration. The power to control the distribution is in the hands of the board of directors. Now, we have a small request, which is to earnestly request the directors of various industries and businesses to allocate a small portion of the surplus as "social welfare funds." The amount is not fixed, one-thousandth is fine, one-hundredth is better. And under the "social welfare funds," the most important is the "student aid fund" for creating talents for the country. We ask the directors of the industrial and commercial sectors not to overlook this matter, and not to shirk it! This is the best way to use the power of the "collective" to help young people who have dropped out of school. It is much greater than individual power. Like the "student aid fund" responsible for 5,000 outstanding students from poor families in this newspaper, the amount is at least over 30 million yuan. The responsibility for fundraising must be borne by everyone, and everyone must contribute money in order to complete the mission of "aiding students." We ask the readers to teach us further, how grateful we would be!</p>
<p>Loving Mother's Birthday Funds Transferred to Aid Students</p>
<p>The Yu and Zhang families used funds meant for their loving mother's birthday to support charitable causes, transforming extravagance into something useful and benefiting relatives and friends, which is admirable. The original letters are recorded as follows: (1) The Yu Guangmei, Guangyu, Guangfan, and Guangyuan brothers wrote: "Regarding the twentieth of this month, which is the sixtieth birthday of our mother, in these difficult times, we cannot bear to be extravagant. Upholding her wishes, we simplify expenses and do not hold any ceremonies. Gifts from relatives and friends are declined. We respectfully donate 200,000 yuan in national currency, divided between your newspaper's student aid fund and the Xinwen Bao's loan fund for students, 100,000 yuan each, as a small contribution. We enclose a check for 100,000 yuan in national currency, which we kindly ask you to receive."</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Zhongyuan wrote: "Recently, it was my mother's birthday, and I am very grateful for the grand ceremony sponsored by my relatives and friends. Now, I will take out 20,000 yuan from the birthday gifts received, in addition to the Jin Che Feng, and send it with a letter as your newspaper's student aid fund, a small contribution to provide assistance. Please receive it. The remaining 390,000 yuan will be distributed to various charitable organizations in accordance with the list to benefit all relatives and friends."</p>

Lang is an internationally renowned photography expert, and his works are outstanding, which goes without saying. This time, he is enthusiastically donating the proceeds to the loan fund for students of the two newspapers, which is commendable.

Those who donate more than 50,000 yuan will receive a bottle from the New Star Pharmaceutical Factory as a sign of respect.) The above totals 200,000 yuan, totaling 2,585,025 yuan.</p>
<p>We are very grateful to Yu Guangmei, Zhang Zhongyuan, Pei De, Li Minglie, and the New China Cotton Wool Weaving Factory for each recognizing a team. The Lian Rang Tang Team was raised by Ji Jun, a student receiving aid from St. John's University. Ji Jun is commendable for raising aid money for this newspaper in addition to his studies. We hope that students from various schools can follow Ji Jun's righteous example and work together to achieve the goal of fundraising as soon as possible. We look forward to it very much.</p>
