<p>社評</p>
<h3>對操縱米價黑市者箴告</h3>
<p>最近句且以來，本市米價黑市激漲不已，引起人心恐慌，　隍不安。其激漲原因，一部分固然為了戶日米的延期配給，由於恐慌心理所促成。不過，黑市的形成，本來是漫無標準的，最易為投機者所操縱，掀風作浪，推波助瀾。近幾年來，物價高漲至目前程度，雖有種種經濟上的因素，但在每次的波動過程中，人為的操縱，推波助瀾，造成黑市的猖獗，使高漲程度，超越經濟因素的範圍，實為最大原因。米價如此，一般物價亦然。</p>
<p>操縱黑市者，就公務人員言，就是貧官污吏。就一般人言，就是追求暴利主義者。他們的居心，都是不採手段，唯利是圖，不顧大眾，唯求自肥。</p>
<p>據情報所傳，最近木市米價黑市，波動之烈，實有若干不肖份子，在幕後投機操縱所致。我們鑒於過去經騐，對此情報自可置信。這般投機操縱的不肖份子，常然又是追求暴利主義者，諺云：「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生。」我們痛感現社會的環境實在太惡劣了，追暴利者實在太多了。我們於此，願以兩事向追求暴利者再作一次箴告：</p>
<p>我們在本月十二日社評中，提出過兩句俗諺：「不愁人不知，除非己莫為」。任你們認為絕對秘密的事情，除非不做，做出了終究有人知道的。所以，你們在幕後策劃的拾高黑市米價，已經被冷眼者察覺了，已經有人注意你們的動作了。千萬提防，等到一日法律生效的時候，就是你們身敗名裂的時候。到了這一個末甘，你們追求暴利所得來的黃白之物，是否還能供你們的享受？是否可以贖取你們的罪過？遠的不說，顧實衡與周乃文，后大椿與胡政，地位不算低，勢力不算小，恐怕你們是望塵莫及，自嘆小巫吧！可是，顧周為陛下之囚，后胡為斷頭之鬼，身敗名裂以後，大家還嗤之以鼻。這類的殷鑑，也够你們參考了吧！懸崖勒馬！千萬記着！</p>
<p>其交，米糧是大衆生命所擊，不可一日或缺，在人類生活上比之任何事物為重要。上海有五百萬人口，上海的米價，五百萬男婦老幼所共同注視的。如果米價由你們所操從而使黑市狂漲，那末，五百萬男女老幼對於你們的印象是怎樣？咀咒得怎樣？雖然這是無形的，可是對你們的譴責，比較有形的聲，這從良心上道德上出發，也够你們醒悟了吧！懸崖勒馬！千萬記住！</p>
<h3>新政策逐步實施中日關係益密切　谷大使在東京發表談話</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電日駐華谷大使日前返國，十七日下午四時接見紀者團，特就對華新政策實施後之情勢及今後之方針等，發表談話如次：中·日兩國自去年十月締結同盟條約後，兩國之平等互惠關係更形密切，同時，中國已澈底明瞭日本無領土野心，未能使中·日實行全面提携之重慶，對於日本力量之評價仍過低，此實為未能充分瞭解日本眞正之實力所致。又一般大眾因物資缺乏及物價高漲，每日應其生產問題，對於中·日兩國之關係，亦未澈底明瞭，對此確信不久即可解決。關於經濟方面，已將新舊各種敵產陸續交還中國，所有之國策公司，亦積極予以調整，爰長期戰下物資問題實甚困難，其中尤以物資之雷用供給及物價高漲問題為最，蓋此種現象乃戰爭期中所不可免者，關於此點，中國有識之士亦甚瞭解，要之，新政策之逐步實施，實可增加國府及經濟方面對日本之理解。又國府首腦部為加强中·日提挑之關係，特改革中央機構，樹立戰時下之簡素化體制，成立改革省·縣等地方機構之議案，並逐步實施之，同時為應付物價問題，對於公務員之薪金亦量高五六倍，且實施配給廉價米等方策。於政治上言，現在中國可分為三種勢力，即國府勢力，中共勢力，重慶勢力，國府因與日本締結同盟，努力政治機構尤以對地方及警察機構之改革，最為完善。同時並任上海財界及思想界之有力者二十六人為諮詢委員，以資答覆政府之問實施自發性政策之建議，預料一年後新政策之貢實施當可獲得相雷效果，相信中·日間之關係，今後更可密切，同時本人亦傾全力向前推進，亦獲得所期之效果。</p>
<h3>日印同盟軍精銳全線展開總攻擊　哥希馬附近敵軍反攻受挫</h3>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電巴列爾一帶之敵軍，由葛基勒方面獲得新援後，乃試作殊死抵抗，日·印同盟軍之諸精銳，十一日拂曉在日空軍之協力下，於全綫展開總攻擊，是役中，日機大編隊曾猛炸先拿姆，昂達茲克，拉姆坎庫諾及五八一五高地，並該地公路南側之敵輪型陣地，予以莫大損失，尤其先拿姆敵第二十師之戰鬥司令部，投以巨彈如雨，其兵營等均中彈起火，使敵中樞戰鬥機關陷於混亂。日·印軍精銳乘敵軍混亂之際，即開始總攻，日軍之一部十二日晨進至五一八五高地東方之某基地邊緣，由南方壓迫敵陣，又丹克諾巴爾方面日軍主力，猛烈轟擊巴列爾敵機塲，敵軍即陷於大混亂，十一日晨七時頃，英兵十五人置古爾加兵於前衛，欲圖脫逃，但為日軍發現，當即將之完全殲滅。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電據印度前綫日軍某基地電，敵軍為奪回哥希馬，曾于十二日晨在空軍掩護下，以中型戰車十餘輛進迫哥希馬高地之日軍堅陣，經日軍部隊邀擊後，即破毀其四輛。一方日軍更集中射擊，曾于十二·三兩日來攻哥希馬北方（五一二）高地方面之敵軍，當收獲相常戰果，計是役敵軍遺屍二一○具，日軍整敗敵重迫擊砲一門，戰車六輛。十二日，英兵古勞加兵百餘人，曾潛人納爾海馬附近及納爾海馬東方之幾塞為柃馬，但經日軍駐屯部隊於是日傍晚奇襲後，即行潰退。另一方面，敵軍二百人曾于十二日潛入其斯烏馬附近，即在該地構築陣地，謀進窺哥希馬北方，但經日軍駐屯部隊强襲，予以重大打擊後，敵軍即向北方潰走。現該處日軍更急追此項潰走之敵軍，刻仍在納爾海馬北方圍擊中。又侵入巴克茲米及齊古茲密方面之敵軍，現正糾合該地附近之殘敗軍，急謀發動，並藉空中補給與迫　砲之掩護，企圖西進，經日軍各部隊予以邀擊後，是項敵軍即已陷於潰滅之命運。</p>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電印度方面敵軍對哥希馬之反攻，日益激烈，陸續由迪馬普爾方面增援，而為台蘇馬附近七五二二高地附近，布置三旅一大隊，更將混成機甲師及獨立戰車隊集中於茲普薩以北，連日對日軍陣地試作反攻，尤以對四六〇英里達標高地之反攻最為激烈。十一日朱明，砲擊歷兩小時後，敵軍以戰車及裝田軍二十餘輛來攻，日軍當以對戰車砲應戰，擊毀其裝里車九輛，將敵軍主力擊退，更對其西南方陣地殘留之敵軍加以攻擊。</p>
<h3>巴享氏發表　調查團使命</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電緬甸調查團團長巴亨，十八日上午十時半晋宮，覲謁日天皇陛下致敬，下午二時半接見記者團發表談話，大意謂：本人晋宮時，辱承天皇陛下賜見，而得瞻仰聖儀，實感榮幸之至，同時並蒙對緬甸各種問題有所垂詢，日皇陛下對緬何關懷之切實，令余感激不盡。吾等調查團之使命，係考察大東里各國對防衛國土之設施及復興建設之各種情况，現在緬甸地處大東亞戰綫之最前方，致時遭敵機之空襲，對此已蒙日本在武力上予以援助。同時，緬甸並選拔有為靑年，派赴日本留學，期這就中堅將校，而成為國軍之幹部。關於民問防衝方面，亦效法日本之鄰組，以十戶為一單位，以其中一戶為指導者，而担任消防及死傷者之救護工作。目前緬甸方踏入復與之途，故頗期待大東亞各先進國之指導，俾加强國力，此不僅陸軍如此，即海軍亦須積極建設。同時，戰後之復與建設，亦屬重要問題，故為解决以上各問題起見，特來日考察，然嚴要者係考察為完遂大東亞戰爭之各種設施，以為借鏡，而為建設强大國家之方針。</p>

<p>南京十八日中央社電軍事委員會政治部，半年來破疲渝共反動陰謀案件，一部份已誌前報，茲續行訪錄於後：　渝忠救軍吳嘉吳，先遣支隊第二大隊隊長，兼渝中央政治局，廣德調查室，蘇州獨立組組長徐錫庭，於本年一月九日，假裝柴販，潛抵蘇州，經該地工作人員偵悉，徐錫庭與忠救軍總部軍需膚蘭英，在城內之吳菜社晚餐。當派幹員加以逮捕，據供係奉上峯密令，佈置爆破工作。此次同來者，尚有渝忠救軍蘇錫滬直屬爆破組組員徐錫華一名，潛居嘉應會館，附近永豐柴行內。乃於同月十二日，按址將該徐錫華逮捕，並續獲　輸炸藥人陳生·一名，抄獲大批爆炸器材。旋同綫案在火車站捕獲直屬組組長沈千里。組員施志清二名，抄出炸藥十塊，丁拉密達炸藥七十八塊，黃色炸藥粉五磅，白銅電管七根，緩燃導火綫五公尺，延期信管十四根，磁鐵爆破器一具，白金錢信管二十一根，紫銅電管卞七根。又分別在上海·無錫·等地，枸獲該組組員陸綺華趙覺，通信連絡員舒明奎等三名。　會在渝忠救軍充特務長之錢鑒鎔，於去年十一月間參加鳥江方面渝忠救軍工作，嗣以生活困難，乃由烏江潛行來京，經於上年十二月十五日，派員在本京水西門外，唐德保北貨行內，將其捕獲。　渝江蘇省保安隊第四縱隊第八團第三營營長汪寄萍，化名張振華，潛　上海第八區祥生飯店，圖於短期內遣返屯溪，當於去裁十二月廿二日將該犯達　·　反動份子仲才郎，於上年十二月一日潛入作。當於同月三日，在無錫城　捕獲。　赤共游縣花山區廊山鄉公所情報員支樹　，潛入　縣絨內，刺探我方情報，經我方偵悉，於二月廿日予以逮捕。</p>
<h3>新運會林秘書長　蒞蕪湖視察</h3>
<p>蕪湖十八日中央社電新國民運動促進委員會林秘書長蒞蘇後，當晚即下榻于皖一區清鄉專團第二辦事處。十七日晨八時，即召集該署全體工作人員曁清鄉工作人員，訓練班全體學員訓話，語多勗勉。九時繼赴本區農村青年幹部訓練所，及農業講習所視察，該所全體師生，均列隊歡迎。當由該所周所長引導分別往各室巡視一過。並對該所訓練善垂詢綦詳，旋即返回專署，躬臨出席全縣青少年歡迎大會，旋切致訓。指示青少年應負使命等，詞意警惕，寓意深長，全體青少年恭聆之餘，莫不感奮。詞畢，再分別前往中國青年館，安微省無湖分館，及本縣新運支會青少年團部視察後，復親蒞無湖新報社及中央電訊社無湖分社視察。旋赴和平</p>
<h3>教部發表項重要工作　兩項重要工作　昨日接見中外記者</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電教育部十八日接見中外記者，由社教司長王一方說明該部重要工作兩項：　積極注重國民健康教育，曾通令舉辦各省市運動會，江蘇·上海市·華北已舉行，其他省市正積極籌備。　本年三月十五日，召開二次體委會議，結果圓滿。　本屆兒實節，確定提倡兒童健康運動中心工作，通飭遵辦，現全國紛紛舉辦兒童健康比賽。　木部成立醫學教育委員會，木年四月二十四日，在京舉行第一次會議，決議造就醫學人材。大學醫學院，獨立學院，注重質的教育基本問題。　國定教科書早經出版，高中教本已着手編輯，本年秋季始業教科書，印刷已規劃就緒。初中教科書第七版，小學教科書第九版，經中國聯合出版公句開始印刷，三個月印成。　關於學制課程，組織學制課程標準研究委員會，呈政院批准，正銓衡委員，謀中國教育制度根本確立。至從事教育工作人員土活，一再通令增　教育經費，提高待遇，及物資從優配給，務盡吾人之所及，為教育同仁解決一切。</p>
<h3>中共代表　林祖涵抵渝</h3>
<p>中央社派訊據到達此地之重慶消息，渝力記者與外人記者，於十七日飛赴赤都延安。又傳蔣介石氏於該記者等一行啓程前，曾表示期望彼等至少於延安滯留二月，對最近外國關於渝共問題所作種種批評之問題，作一詳密之調查報告。蓋英美兩國屢對渝方揚言，欲英美兩國加强對渝援助，須以渝方統一國內戰綫為前提，而要求渝共妥協，故該記者等此行，與此實有關聯。自本年初以來，英美即屢屢要求派遣記者團赴延安考察，但蔣恐於國民黨獨裁下之重慶，與大體已形成政治體之延安相較，暴露自身弱點，故迄未應允，但結果乃招來英美對重慶獨裁之猛烈抨擊。蔣不得已，遂於五月二日任王世杰為代表，與中共代表陕甘寗邊區政府主席林祖涵，於西安協議商討對外人記者團考察延安之具體辦法，及調整渝共關係之一般問題。此次外人記者得能成行，雖云渝共關係之調整，困難猶多，至少亦為因重慶讓步，渝共已行接近之意。又林祖涵於西安會談完畢後·於十七日到達重慶，預定日內即與蔣氏會見。</p>
<h3>西歐德總司令晤貝當元首倫斯德深信必可獲勝</h3>
<p>巴黎十八日中央社電德國新聞社訊，法政府情報局今日宣稱：貝當元首昨接見駐法德軍總司令倫斯德元帥。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電德國新聞社訊：西歐德軍德司令倫斯德元帥司令部，對英·美侵犯歐陸之準備頗為注意，並深信德軍必能獲得勝利。元帥本人為久經沙塲之軍人，深知德軍與反軸心雙方之衝突，勢必演為劇烈之戰事，而需要重大之損失與犧牲。倫斯德元帥深知德國之作戰效力與集中於西方國牆後之德軍實力，故相信德國必能擊潰英·美之進攻。倫斯德元帥時常視察德軍防禦之準備情形，但在戎馬倥惚中，仍能在其司令部周國美麗之古公園中作偶然之散步。</p>
<h3>新四軍與渝軍雙方關係惡化</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊新四軍自前年皖南事件發生後，其主力即移向長江北岸，但最近復進出於長江南岸，遂與重慶之忠救軍，演成爭奪地盤之鬥爭·蓋新四軍之兵力向為七師，然近來則因極力擴充，遂增加兩師。任劉炎為第七師師長，何克希為第八師師長，使之奪取皖省東南部地區，該地區為重慶忠救軍所據，因之雙方關係乃又趨惡化。</p>
<h3>陳省長談蘇施政方針</h3>
<p>蘇州十八日中央社電陳省長昨發表談話云，此次中央政府通過地方行政協構改革方案，確切適合於戰時體制。江蘇省政府遵照中央意旨，切實舉行。今後省府本會署辦公之精神，行政事務必較以前更為迅速，栽併各機關，栽汰沉員，並取消一向掛名及坐領乾薪之弊。縣長及各縣保安隊長，警察局長，以及佐治人員，均須素的經騐者，不得濫竽充數，一洗從前地方半割據制度狀態，及種種任用私人之習慣，秉承中央意旨，監督指導，以期實施高度清鄉工作，提高行政效率。</p>

<h3>美海長談話　不值識者一笑　松島部長論太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>美國新任海軍部長佛爾列斯特，十七日會見新聞記者，言及太平洋戰局時，曾稱：「太平洋北中南各部，美軍航空部隊，隨時地不斷攻擊，從千島羣島，經馬紹爾羣島，以迄俾斯麥羣島之日軍防綫，現在已成為有名無實，美國空軍及艦隊目下正在此外廓綫內一千五百哩，到處展開活潑作戰，故特魯克島，波納皮島及馬紹爾羣島中之日軍殘存基地，急待南方各地友軍守備部隊之應援」云云。此種說法，僅對太平洋戰局現况作一表面概觀·一無新的認識，但是新任海軍部長為求民眾信仰，故有此種說明，俾令人有美軍如何在作戰之印象。然於日方見之，此說不值識者一笑，日駐華艦隊報道部長松島慶三大佐·昨日會見記者時，對於美海軍部長之說明，下如此之批評。</p>
<p>重大犧牲所得無幾</p>
<p>一九四二年八月所羅門羣島反攻作戰開始以來，在此二十一個月中，美軍不惜任何犧牲獲得之地域，不過是我防衛大東亞的外廓圈，美軍現在以此等基地為立足點，虎視眈眈，伺機企圖突入日軍防衛綫，然此事誠非易易。美軍雖然奪取土地，但必須配備强力部隊始能發揮基地的機能，敵方今日尚未配備充分丘力，故其地位决非鞏固，口軍如果一度蹶起，奪還該等地方，將不費吹灰之力，敵人每恃物質上之優越，頻頻出擊，但日軍態度自若，予以邀擊。</p>
<p>敵美弱點接濟困難</p>
<p>美國陸軍中校卡能寞亦曾說過，戰爭决非僅恃資材而可獲勝者，美國雖然跨稱生產力强盛，但人力資源猶感不足，最近美國動員女子二百萬人，此更可作為佐證，反之，日本人力資源，猶綽有餘裕，其次敵方愈拓展戰綫，則兵站接濟路綫，益為延長，因此引起最大弱點，即使有如澳洲之接濟基地，但僅賴該地，不能顧全太平洋作戰之全局，而日方接濟綫，比敵方為短，此點實屬有利。敵方潛艇對於日軍海上運輸路之妨害，亦因日本海軍採取適當對策，已獲顯著效果。</p>
<p>戰局前途具自信力</p>
<p>第三從軍需而產生觀，現代之戰爭，為國家之總力戰，軍需產量可支配戰局，但飛機船舶燃料等之生產，由於日本全國之努力，日有進展，尤以飛機生產為然，故日本對此方面奄無不安。吾人作如此想時，對太平洋戰局前途，可明瞭日本已具自信力。特魯克，波納皮，馬紹爾羣島等地日軍守備步隊，尚安好健全，現在該方面戰事之沉寂，係日方在全綫慎重整頓之關係，今從敵人仍將作拼命反攻，但一俟日軍準備完成，則敵人必受重大打擊。</p>

<h3>經濟評言　證券市傷的眞敵</h3>
<p>誰為證券市塲的眞敵？一句話說來，就是證券市塲中一般「不擇手段，不顯大眾，損人利己，惟圖私利」的投機份子。上海華商證券市塲之脫離常態－證券價格的狂漲與慘跌－可以說完全是這般人所一手造成的；他們在證券市塲蓬勃的時候，則百計拉抬，不惜掀風作浪，在證券市塲萎縮的時候，則千方揪抑，不惜投井下石；其所採取的手段，雖絕對相反，可是，其目標則殊金而同歸，就是把大眾的汗血所得，來供他們的玩弄，使他們自己獲得暴利。</p>
<p>在去年華商證券價格瘋狂上騰，漫無止境的期間，我們也曾提出證券投機所造成的危險性，在今年華商證券市塲一蹶不振的一個凄慘環境下，我們當然也要提出證券投機所造成的危險性了。這次的危險性是什麼？就是社會上最大多數善意的投資散戶，平時靠着證券投黃來保障或挹注其生活的，由於此次上海證芬市壩拋空投機行為的猖獗與蔓延，竟至無一不遭無謂之損失（因為有好幾種股票價格，竟被拋空份子壓至其資產價值五倍以下者）而使其生活蒙受嚴重的影響。其尤堪注意者，就是有些金融機關借用他人抵押之設票，來參加拋空投機，此風尤不可長，否則整個金融市塲是要同歸於盡的，切望當局有以嚴厲取締之！</p>

<h3>申報周刋　堅固不拔的　日軍內南洋要塞</h3>
<p>太平洋的戰局，自一月末美軍侵攻馬紹爾以來，其有力機動部隊於二月中旬出現於特魯克，同月底復於馬利亞納羣島圖謀蠢動，及至三月末，更深人西加洛林羣島，其意向何在，可想而知。雖然他們屢受打擊，幾經頓挫，但仍以有力的部隊四出紛授，其企圖的執拗及戰意的旺盛，固然不容等　視之，但他們的出擊究竟獲得了什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>日軍並未惑於這種機動戰術，而正確地把握太平洋義局現階段的眞相，對於美軍出擊的效果，既不轉視，亦不估價太高；日軍太平洋上的各個基地，毅然聳立，正迎待著美、機的空襲。</p>
<p>洋上長城　美軍在中央太平洋的主力，當然是以航空母艦為中心的機動部隊。其有利之點是可以在浩渝的太平洋上迅速移動，無一異為移動的航空基地，因而能够一時集中相當數量的航空兵力，展開空中攻勢。不過；航空母艦在其性質上終受時間的限制，為了整備的綠故，隔了若千時日以後，不得不駛防基地。企圖由機動戰突破日軍太平洋防線中央部分的美軍，由於上述的理由，非推進艦隊根墟地乃至給養基地不可。在這一點上，儼然阻住美軍野心的日本內南洋以至中央太平洋的各個基地，實係洋上長城，十分重要。</p>
<p>空軍激戰　美軍以消滅日本各基地航空力為其使攻的前擔，但因他們自己的基地航空力的一定的限界，所以不得不專賴機動航空力。對於在大型機轟炸圈內的特魯克諸島，則用基地航空兵力作牽制轟炸，對於遠離的馬利亞拿羣島。西加洛林羣島方面，則屢次出動機動航空兵力，以期破壞日本的基地網。在南太平洋方面，本為基地航空兵力助手的美軍機動航空兵力，現竟反客為主，向日軍戕地桃戰。於是戰局便呈美軍機動航空兵力和日軍基地航空兵力激戰的模樣。</p>
<p>燄火空襲　由機動部隊實行空襲，雖得集中相當多量的航空兵力於一時，但結果也是暫時性質的，並無持續性。正如燄火一般，倏而炸裂，倏而消失。在中部太平洋，美軍雖然再三實行機動空襲，但所能給與日軍基地的損害，實際上是微科其微的。盆觀敵軍對拉巴爾連日狂投炸彈尚且不能停止日軍盡行塲的機能，而日方武裝戰薄的運輸機亦能克服非常的困難，相當頻繁地昇降，則機動空襲的效果如何，不雖想見。美軍體戰機的燄火空襲，至多不過留下若干可以槇平的洞穴在地面上而已。</p>
<p>自掘墳墓　反之，美軍的這種出擊，對於日軍倒是擊碎美軍「空母陣」的絕妙機會。日軍巧妙的誘敵深入的戰術，每次與美軍機動部隊以大打擊。常美機投擲效果殊少的炸彈，盲目亂開機關槍的時候，它們必須回去的老家却成為日軍雷擊機的美餌。它們正如出來自拥壇墓。因此，日軍基地倒是歡迎空襲的。這點恰足說明日軍的基地決不是守勢的守爾基地，而是攻勢的攻擊基地。</p>
<p>航空基地只有所謂不沉航空母艦的優越性。敵方空襲的效果極微，不和攻略並行的機動川擊一類的舉動，正如提供自滅的機會。但日軍基地航空兵力能否充分發揮其優越性而把握粉碎敵軍的機會，則視　飛機的數量，　飛行塲－基地網的整備，　維持這些的給養船舶等各條件而定。因飛機不足而錯過使敵方全軍覆沒的良機，實在是再可惜也沒有的了。在廣漠的海洋上捕捉敵艦踪跡的索敵機固須完備，乾坤一擲而轟沉敵艦的攻擊機固須增强，而邀擊敵機或護衛攻擊隊的戰鬥機，如只優秀的性能及卓越的技倆，則和數架敵機周旋，尚不至於失便宜，也不至於在空戰中被擊隊。不過，在擊下敵機二架，三架，四架，……之中，彈藥如果不織，那就困難了。一架飛機所能應付的敵機的數目，自有其限度。以寡敵眾的苦戰，再沒有比空戰中的更為困難了。</p>
<p>增强基地　飛機的活躍以飛行塲縱的整備為條件。一，二個飛行塲縱因敵機的轟炸而一時不能使用，如果有相近的飛機塲，那就沒有問題。再則，個飛行塲所能收容的飛機架數，是有州定限度的，這情形和航空母艦相似。當然，現在日軍基地並未動搖，正以逸待勞，　擊美軍有力的機動部隊，但是為使日機更有效地活躍，並期大航兵力的廣開，不論有多少飛機，都不會媒其太多。飛行塲和基地羣的整備。對於在遼闊的太平洋上機動的敵軍，這些基地　如綱眼般有機地組織成功的基地網，必須更行增强。此舉務須迅速，而其建設的機械化尤須促進。並於基地航空兵力的活路有賴於給養船舶的不斷到達，也是不用贅言的。</p>
<p>鬥志旺盛　在太平洋正面决戰中認眞幹了起來的美軍，雖蒙創傷，也必再三再四地反復出擊，而其速度亦將加速。因此，基地戰力增强的述度必須比其更快。B29等超大型機的實際應用，姑置不論，突進的美軍機動部隊或許企圖空襲日本本部亦未可知。他們也在考慮各種戰法吧。但是，有備之魂的空襲損害殊微。對於為一大航空基地的日本本土，美軍的燄火式機動空襲等，毋寗是拔本塞源，擊滅敵軍的絕好機會。本部的防備，即在盡量發揮生產基地以至一大攻緊基地的機能。應付空襲的結構，非在守勢，而為貫懋攻勢，茍能如此，自能湧出歡迎空襲的旺盛鬥志。（佐藤報道班員）（吉：譯自四月二十二日朝已新聞）</p>
<h3>長期作戰中　美軍之古惱　旣犧牲又恐失時</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電</p>
<p>據南太平洋前綫日軍某基地電，美國刻正苦　於長期作戰之矛眉中，即短期結束之希望與大量嚴犧牲之恐佈相衡宜春，蓋欲行驅期　，必須集中兵力，但集中兵力則必須犧牲人員，雖美國力謀以物資代替人的消籍，但是　代替超過一足限度時，則戰鬥力之渙散與不均衡，必將接踵而至。爭取時間乎，避免消種乎，二者不可得兼，難煞白宮中之一般政客，因而認為現下所立當採取且」高妙之指導作戰方針，故三月中旬已將中部太平洋試作狙擊，尼米資於北部太平洋最行策動，麥克沃寒於南部太平洋時作呼應，二者欲一致有所動作之態勢·已甚顯明。於是一再襲擊中部太平洋之日軍堡壘，且在新幾內亞及南太平洋方面展開反攻作戰，三月下旬，以為使若干兵力在新不列顛島北方一小島登陸頗可自誇，麥克沃塞逐發表謂，「俾士麥羣島作戰，完全結東。」此種宜傳，乃企圖遮掩美國極恐消耗兵員之最大弱點，自不待曾。舊金山電台曾廣播謂：「由拉巴爾正面海面攻擊拉巴爾實不可能，蓋人的損害過大」。無形中已將麥克沃塞聲明之內情澈　揭穿，直至今”，美軍慣用之戰法，仍如所羅門之例，專　有少數守備隊，甚至無。軍之地方設置登陸基地，此不過遭免人的消耗至　種程度。美軍育　深知，此　戰法接近日軍重要戰綫時，即不能奏效，於是敵軍遂不得不將人的大量消耗競取時間，接近日戰綫愈近，敵軍競取時間接近日本本土之日愈切，其既恐失時，又恐傷人之矛盾，亦愈行深刻。敵軍首腦邵雖力謀制厭戰意識。甚且將所羅門。新幾內亞戰綫受傷之將兵僅送至澳洲治療，不敢送至他處，但種種悲慘事實，如美軍遭逢日軍突擊則驚惶號泣，以自動步槍胡亂放射，如密林濕地多數美兵下肢完全腐爛等等，已由各方面傳入美國，釀成美國人民對戰爭嫌惡之悠情。最近將來·敵軍若出擊日軍內綫堅陣·大加打擊，損兵折將時，世人即可深知「傷人」與「競時」之正面行動，為美軍之指導戰爭方針帶來何等重大之混亂。</p>
<h3>嚴陳以待的　歐洲要塞</h3>
<p>西歐四千公里，東歐二千公里，及南歐三千公里的大三角形－「歐洲要塞」，正充滿著山雨欲來風滿樓的景象。蘇軍的大反攻，以四月八日起的克里米之戰為最高峯，四月中旬以來，已告一段落，目前似專在準備木來攻勢。而英美空軍的空中玫勢，亦與之若合符節，日趨激化。其目標在於法國北部各地及巴黎近郊，比國各地，尤以不魯塞爾為中心的交通要衡為最。該方面不僅因有德軍的火箭式長距離克陣地，美國軍事評詢家喬治愛立特且稱，其主要目的在使德軍從前哨陣地後退。</p>
<p>兵力一斑　據相林人士觀測敵方攻的侵兵力師計卅，美廿八至卅師，加拿大軍波蘭流亡軍及其他難牌軍五師，合計六士二至六十五師，其中有空輸部隊五師。</p>
<p>德軍的邀擊準備，其詳不得而知，據英報推測為百五十至百七十師團。即挪成十師，丹麥波蘭十五師，德國北部十師，法團，比利時，荷關方面五十師，義大利十師，巴爾幹十師，待機於本國之預備軍四十五師。</p>

<h3>像曉星般　零亂的回憶</h3>
<p>— 范振家</p>
<p>人們假使令他們的父母傷心，這眞是不可寬恕的罪惡呵！每當夜裏，我失眠時，便記起了父親和母親，我記得當我還是很小的孩子的時候，母親想念着遠離的父親，她把面頰靠在我的頭上，拉住我的一雙手，她輕輕的呌我：</p>
<p>「小實寶！好寶寶！母親在寂寞時要看看你，你別離開你的媽！」</p>
<p>可是為了生活，在十二歲的時候我就離開了她，有些時候，我想像着她正伏在窗口，對著故鄉的月亮，想念着天涯飄泊的愛兒，我又彷彿聽見她的噓氣，她的面上流着晶瑩的淚珠，我也想像秋風秋雨蕭條的夜裏，她獨自亮了燈，靜靜的坐着。當我每次生病躺在牀上時，我的頭十分昏暈，我又似乎聽見了母親的聲音，在各方面傳來，輕經的慈藹的呌着我：「小寶寶！好寶寶！……小寶寶！好寶寶！………」×…×…×…×…×…</p>
<p>我也記得我的父親，他是一個當於思考的人，他有於沉的隊，深深的眼珠。</p>
<p>故鄉，是我生長起來的地方，永遠　掛着我的憶絲，門前流　小河，在天來到時，春水漲了，載一着綠色的浮萍，流，流，流向那無窮的遠方，和天相核的境界，在秋月輕　微　時，眞是一條心靈的河啊　初夏的早晨，日光隱滿了鄉村，廣闊的原野上，開遍了紫雲英，在那而多樹的地方，住着依紅小妮子是我那時的小情人，通過她家的小溪，就是那有名的辛溪，夏夜的　火蟲，飛過河來又飛過河去，停歇在河邊的水草上，兌曾經如何地　引過我和伊呵！</p>
<p>父親不許我去看她，約她在林子裏散步，我却愉愉跑去，送給她島蛋和野菓，我們唱歌並且散步，父親一天知道了發狂般慣怒了，他抓住了我，用一條木棒敲着我，無論頭上，手上，身上，他粗魯的現象，使得母親為之泣下。</p>
<p>「打傷他了！打死他了！……」。母親哭着，可是父親仍任意地打着我，並且說：</p>
<p>「誰教會你這些的？誰教會你這些的？」父親把我關在一間放柴的低舊污穢的房子裹，他自己便在外面踱步，重濁地來；重濁地去，我却在裏面悲傷地哭着：</p>
<p>「父親啊！……你打了我了！……父親啊！你在發怒時無情地打了我了！……」</p>
<p>父親在門外嘆著氣，終於他來開門了，他捏着我的乎，把我拉到屋後面，撫摸着我被他的棒擊傷的地方，紅色靑色的腫痛着他拿他的衣服揩着我的淚，恢復了仍像以前一般的慈愛，或許更藹然些了，他安慰著我，他低聲說</p>
<p>「孩子！你限我嗎？」恨你的爸嗎？」他像乞恕一般的望着我。</p>
<p>「我沒有恨爸！」我流着涙說。</p>
<p>「吹！孩子！你以為依紅很美麗嗎？你很歡喜她嗎？你錯了！成她美的是她家裹的錢呵！她的爸爸剝下了窮人的衣服，奪下了他們的碗和　，他自己很有錢了，他的女兒美　起來，……但是，我的孩子你有事要去做的，你要去奔走，你的前程，孩子！……孩子！……」我抬起頭來，望着爸爸，爸爸坐在一塊石頭上，他抱着我的頭頸，我的面貼着爸的面，我的手圍着爸的胸，我的心和爸的心一起跳著，於是他又緩慢地問我：</p>
<p>「孩子！你還在恨著爸嗎？」</p>
<p>「不！」我說：「爸爸：我們永遠這樣抱着吧後來，父親離開了故鄉，生活之鞭打着他，驅策他去到困苦的地方，在那裹，他的棺材靜靜地運回來，他的墳墓，不久就被兔子選中，牠們造了洞穴。</p>
<p>我也記得我幼年時，「我家的老傭婦，我呌她好婆的，她支持：着龍鐘衰老，傴僂的身軀，在廚房灶下，工作着，她是組母的女婢，一直延用下來，效衰老了。</p>
<p>「好婆呀！」我說：「你的兒子呢？女兒呢？他們不把你接回去，給福你享麼？」</p>
<p>像我這類的話，最使他難過了，她是這樣晚景凄凉孤獨的老婆婆呵！現在我才想到為何子和女併起來，就成了「好」字，可是。世上也有使父母傷心的人在呢。</p>
<p>「好婆死後，你也記得好婆麼？」她問我，她的心中羨島善有兒女的老年人。</p>
<p>「是的呀！當然的羅！」我輕鬆的回答，這使她苦笑，或許是眞誠的笑，臉上縱橫的皺紋，更加皺了起來，後來她病了，倒在床上，母親呌我到姑母家去，回來時，她睡的一間房間的門，已被緊緊關着了，我以後再也不曾見過她，我偷偷地從縫中窺視，房間裹有的是空虛，寂寞，和一種兌不出的恐怖佔據着。</p>
<p>這些景象一直縈繞着我的心，我想着·假使我不奮鬥，不掙扎，情然地死去，母親將怎樣呢？她也會到一家人家去做備婦，然後戰着無一窮的幽恨老去，死去呵！</p>
<p>疾病襲來時，我躺在一床上，似乎看見死神的手，在黑暗中向我伸過來，正像伸向其他的人一般，像伸向我的爸一樣，特　笑著，誘惑地說：</p>
<p>「來吧，來吧，把痛苦和其他的不幸都交給我！「但是，我又聽見了母覫的聲音，我又聽看見了分親深深的眼珠。</p>
<p>人們啊！你們想想看，在誰都棄絕你，詛咒你時，你的父母是否收受了。你，安慰你重頭裏氣的神情，別人都冷笑你時，父親和母親是否還愛着你，用他們的涙珠洗滌你的非惡，他們的心中帶着更甚於你的憂愁？</p>
<p>我活着，奮鬥着，我要安慰我孤獨的母親，我要安慰我孤獨的母親啊！</p>
<p>每次，月色很好的夜裏，我更想起了故鄉的蛙聲，她們在遠處或近處和嗚着，我寂寬的靈魂，便又在低吟着：</p>
<p>「春風又綠江南草，明月何時照我還？」了！</p>

<p>我在沙漠上旅行：</p>
<p>風吹響了駝鈴，</p>
<p>暴雨打濕了衣襟，</p>
<p>我是多麼難受，懼驚；</p>
<p>可是我要奔尚我的前程。我在沙漠止旅：。四週不見故人，又無水綠草靑，我是多麼孤獨，悽憐可是我仍要奔向我的前程。一望無際的戈壁沙漢我趕了多少多少路程仍不見小河溪流，口渴得要命！脚不能停頓，我暈倒了。。一陣小雨把我　醒，我立刻忘却勞頓，再奔我的路程。</p>

<p>我不能停頓，得走完我的路程！</p>
<h3>評「血濺芙蓉」</h3>
<p>— 古辛</p>
<p>故事底商討</p>
<p>這是一部以緝私隊破獲情片私運團不題材的滿洲國偵探片。</p>
<p>故事相　驚險曲折，但還不失其寫實性。有美貌的少婦，因吸烟上癮，不得不入人圈套，冒著生命危險以換取幾兩過　的烟土；有狡詐狠毒的罪魁，為了各自的利益關係而目相殘殺；有一失足成千古恨的　羽，棄邪備正的一天，也就是他死期到來的一天；有草原上警　大格門；再穿　一段輕輕的羅曼史。有些情節，是頗模訪美國底武俠片的。</p>
<p>假若說句時毛話，在禁賭禁舞禁毒正當屬行的時候開映這樣一個內容的影片，是很合胃口的。起初我也這樣想。可是看到故事底結局。卻不禁有令人啼笑皆非之感；原來旨起最未一塲大決鬥，乃至使靑年緝私官楊國保受了不輕的傷的，只為了援救一簡載有「官買鴉片」的火車！結論實在值得重行考慮。旣已閘明鴉片底毒害於先（影片裏的一段演講），必須嚴加搜捕，為什麼還要有「官買鴉片」？難道拯救那些斷了私運鴉片路的　君子之道只有供給他們「官買鴉片」麼？那末所謂「禁毒」云，究竟是禁「吸鴉片」呢，還是禁「私運鴉片」呢？人很容易發生這樣</p>
<p>也許編劇者受了俗套故事形式底限制，不能不用以「私」破壞「公」的對比來想强調罪犯們底罪該萬死，並且呌他們自投羅網。但這仍不能掩飾鴉片」的火本，除了濫發憤，並無什么好處；而只他們即將逃到國外去，為了略出怨氣而情愿慢一點逃走，以致為警員追　按說不值得之極。即使必須呌惡人落綱，讓私運者胆壯一點，不逃走也可，破壞任何別的公共事業也可（雖然這樣作結也並不好），又何獨與「官買鴉片」？質之高明，以為如何？藝術上的成就</p>
<p>我觀滿洲國片還是第一次，以前雖有過幾張來滬，慚愧得很，我都沒機會去欣賞。但道第一次給我的印象，却是許多中國影片里不很看到的新技巧底聰明的應用。那是值得我們親愛的上海導演先生們去研究一下的。</p>
<p>「音　對位法」，達在十一年前歐洲已有人應用了，可是在中國至今還够新鮮的東西。當一個人在說或演講時，鏡頭可以並不限制在說話人或會塊上，隨時移到一個適合情調的別的地方？巧妙的象徵，像盛開的花（可惜看不淸楚長什麼花）表示愛情，絞弄乎帕顯示內心底苦悶，花落表示一個純潔的靈魂底逝去；尤其幾個描寫和記述的塲面，簡直是散文；陪　的許多片段的美麗的畫面就是形容詞－但它們也正像散文一樣不易懂，差不多都需要觀眾運用一下思維底機稱。</p>
<p>接很洗練，沒有拖泥帶水的弊病。尤其結尾底手法，很有使人回味的音韻。但以共太洗練，形容詞鏡顯幾乎都一瞬而過，呌人來不及理會的樣子，一向不慣帶着思索的腦袋去電影院的上海觀眾，更覺得不容易瞭解。所以不受歡迎是取然的。</p>
<p>至於配音方面，卻不也恭維。它正和多數中國影片一樣犯了配音不準的毛病，於是產生了亞電兩重性，成為有壓的無聲電影，看着眞呌人不舒服。</p>
<p>我希望別的滿洲國片會給我更好的印象。</p>

<h3>全滬公開籃球女組冠軍　綠隊人材齊全　參加聯賽各隊均見進步</h3>
<p>本屆全滬公開籃球賽，有女子賽之舉辦，使踴躍欲試之戰士，得以發揮宿願·故加入者有五隊之多，經二月餘之競爭，大華　隊均能保持不敗紀錄，於本星期一（十五日）在靑年會健身房舉行决賽。錄隊不負眾望，終各方面之成功，獲得錦標，大華屈居亞軍。茲先敘決賽戰之及評論兩隊成功及失敗之點，再作戰後餘感。</p>
<p>球塲空前熱鬧戰情極度緊張</p>
<p>是夕僅有決賽單獨一項，而觀衆該達千餘人，足微女子籃球，亦已普及各界，能有此成績，決非偶然。雙方均有啦啦隊助成，鶯鶯燕燕，其熱鬧狀况，可稱空前之作。比賽順利進行，其精神有足多者。比賽經過，大華先盛後衰，初以七對一佔絕對優勢，繼為綠隊逐漸追上，終且以經騐稍差，而遭敗績。綠隊得以二十二對十四告捷，膺本屆女子皇座。然亦敵費一番心力矣</p>
<p>綠隊人材超眾攻猛烈守嚴緊</p>
<p>評綠隊之人材集各名將而成，其個人技術，確介乎各隊之上。且得薛春生之領導有方，錢旭滄謝益欽之指點，故每賽作戰方策，頗能得心應手，操縱自如。談其進攻，大致採用阻擋法，利用三角傳遞，製造空隙。以黃明媛之猛烈跟進，容淑儉之凶狠刦球，又以身材矮小，而能作下路傳遞。其X式之進襲，確屬利害。在必要時且能用中距離投籃，可謂盡善盡美。唯一在決賽一幕中，大致為求勝心切，略具怯塲原因。其拿手好戲發球時之急進突破法，米能應用得體。要亦故重於爾標之得失而致。其守衛而曾，採人釘人及輪迴防守方法，綠隊三衛王維珍劉珍寶汪印關體力充沛，地位角度，亦應用富。故迭戰成績，堪稱華如人意。惜决賽之役，上半時小心過度，乃少佳構，造成沈悶局面。下半時經指導之指示，得以恢復活躍，截球衝前輸送前方，頭頭是道，所以致勝之主因。最後記者觀察綠隊最可取者為施用暗號，極見純熱有效，及前鋒與後衛能呵成一氣。其僅有之缺點，為輪廻防守方法，尚未能登堂入室，稍露漏洞而已。</p>
<p>綠隊全部戰績　　　勝三省　三十七－十六</p>
<p>勝華僑　三十四－十四</p>
<p>勝康愛　五十五－十一</p>
<p>勝六華　二十二－十四</p>
<p>大華新興勁旅惜乎經驗稍差</p>
<p>綠大華隊係新興隊伍，但以主辦人楊叔鼎之熱心，俞菊廣陸鐘恩之備循誘導，進步一日千里，顯有高速進展成績，洵非易事。余信再假以相當時日，綠隊恐難挫其鋒芒也。勉之哉大華將士！致論具攻守之道，觀其各戰中，似極多變化，唯在决賽一戰中，則絕對採用阻擋法。盜深知綠隊守衛係用人釘人，而人釘人守衛最忌阻擋法。初也，頗見成效，進襲有路。惜乎曇花一現。至後因祇知阻擋法，而對方已改變戰策時，依然一本初衷，未能臨陣突變，此經騐之缺少耳。終至功虧一簣，不亦惜乎？大華之守衛為三人聯防備，乃節省體力，以　待勞，阻止敵鋒藍底竄入之唯一捷徑。在此戰上半時中能使緣隊不能操縱自如者，即應用此法成功之點，惜乎始終如此，絕無變化，以此喪失獲球權于無形，亦即减少自身攻勢也。三動確奶利用其身材高大，防止綠隊銳利之攻勢。然以對方黃明媛容淑儉猛烈突破，確屬利害，乃致犯規頻多。虎事實上不得兼顧，非戰之罪也。故大華守衛做到三八聯防術一點，而豪無變化為憾。更之頗覺該隊在取後一節中，極應知所過進及試遠射，或可起死回生。奈何其一貫作風，質為失策。最後該隊有一極明顯之缺點，即前鋒與後衛缺少契點，及後衛對于地位（中綫界限）有認識不淸之弊</p>
<p>聯賽圓滿結束發生感想四點</p>
<p>本屆聯賽女子組已經結束，記者每次參與觀戰，不禁發生感想焉。</p>
<p>緣此次加入者，的綠隊大革華僑三省康愛五隊。其比賽過程中，每隊均每賽有長足之進步，且與趣亦似有增無减。可見女子籃球，顯然能有蓬勃氣象。故鄙意當局極可在最近期內，再試單獨舉辦女子　賽，其加入者之踴躍與夫球員之興奮，必可超乎理想，與不必靜待明年此日，坐令健兒少切磋機會也。</p>
<p>此次加入之五隊，均有良好之指導，平時盡職訓練，賽前鼓勵授計，昨陣度支配，此應為球賽最好之現象。老子此　者，均明瞭球賽不一定是球員戰爭，而確確實實是指導戰爭。所以我希望滬上球隊均應有好指導，則水準必能提高也。</p>
<p>此次女子賽所採規則，係美國規則，有中綫越界限制，此固為女子生理關係，不宜過於劇烈。然考之世界尙無女子規則之限制，觀乎本屆各路娘子軍之作風，余實贊成儘可試行男子規則，俾得有受限制發揮威力。况查我國華北華南諸地，亦均無男女規則之分，而在球藝上，確的更長足進境，故鄙意滬上不妨試行。質之體增前輩，以為何如？</p>
<p>在決賽一役中，兩隊試擲時，綠隊採用十字形傳遞，美麗而切實用。大華亦應用基本鋒衛試擲，較普通隨便試機為可取。於此種暗門中，各盡出奇制勝之能，為提高水準中最有效之辦法，值得贊賞而效法。</p>

<h3>Admonition to Those Manipulating Rice Prices on the Black Market</h3>
<p>Recently, since the beginning of the month, black market rice prices in this city have been soaring, causing public panic and unease. One of the reasons for the soaring prices is, of course, the delayed allocation of rice, which has led to a sense of panic. However, the formation of the black market is inherently without standards, making it extremely easy for speculators to manipulate, stir up trouble, and add fuel to the fire. In recent years, although there have been various economic factors behind the soaring prices, artificial manipulation, adding fuel to the fire, and the resulting rampant black market have been the biggest reasons for the soaring prices exceeding the scope of economic factors. This is true for rice prices and for commodity prices in general.</p>
<p>Those who manipulate the black market are, in the case of public officials, corrupt and greedy officials. In the case of ordinary people, they are those who pursue extreme profit-seeking. Their intentions are unscrupulous, profit-oriented, disregard the public, and seek only personal gain.</p>
<p>According to intelligence reports, the recent sharp fluctuations in the black market rice prices have been caused by certain unscrupulous elements speculating and manipulating behind the scenes. Given our past experience, we can trust this intelligence. These unscrupulous speculators and manipulators are, of course, pursuers of extreme profit. As the saying goes, "Wildfires cannot burn out, and spring breezes bring them back to life." We painfully feel that the current social environment is too harsh, and there are too many pursuers of extreme profit. Here, we would like to offer two pieces of advice to those pursuing extreme profit once again:</p>
<p>In our editorial on the 12th of this month, we put forward two common sayings: "Don't worry about people not knowing, unless you don't do it." No matter how secret you think something is, unless you don't do it, someone will eventually find out. Therefore, your behind-the-scenes plotting to drive up black market rice prices has already been noticed by keen observers, and people are paying attention to your actions. Be very careful, because when the law takes effect, it will be the time when you are discredited. At that point, can the gold and silver you have obtained from pursuing extreme profit still provide you with enjoyment? Can it redeem your sins? Not to mention distant examples, Gu Shiheng and Zhou Naiwen, Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng, their positions were not low, and their power was not small. You probably look up to them and sigh that you are only small fry! However, Gu and Zhou are prisoners of the emperor, and Hou and Hu are ghosts who have lost their heads. After they were discredited, everyone sneered at them. These lessons should be enough for you to consider! Rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff! Remember!</p>
<p>Secondly, rice is essential to the lives of the masses and cannot be missing for even a day. It is more important than anything else in human life. Shanghai has five million people, and the rice prices in Shanghai are watched by five million men, women, old, and young. If rice prices are manipulated by you, causing the black market to soar, what will be the impression of five million men, women, old, and young towards you? What will they say about you? Although this is invisible, the condemnation of you is more powerful than any tangible sound. This comes from conscience and morality and should be enough to awaken you! Rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff! Remember!</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Discusses Increasingly Close Sino-Japanese Relations as New Policies are Gradually Implemented in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Ambassador Tani, who recently returned to Japan, met with a group of reporters at 4:00 PM on the 17th, and made the following statement regarding the situation after the implementation of the new China policy and future directions: Since China and Japan concluded the alliance treaty last October, the equal and mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries has become closer. At the same time, China has thoroughly understood that Japan has no territorial ambitions. Chongqing, which failed to fully cooperate with Japan, still underestimates Japan's power, which is due to a failure to fully understand Japan's true strength. In addition, the general public, due to the lack of materials and high prices, is concerned with their daily production problems and has not thoroughly understood the relationship between China and Japan. I am confident that this will be resolved soon. In terms of the economy, old and new enemy properties are being returned to China one after another. All state-owned companies are also being actively adjusted. The material problem under long-term warfare is indeed very difficult, especially the issue of material allocation and high prices. This phenomenon is unavoidable during wartime, and insightful people in China understand this very well. In short, the gradual implementation of the new policy will increase the understanding of the Japanese by the National Government and in economic terms. In order to strengthen the relationship between China and Japan, the top leadership of the National Government has reformed the central organs, established a simplified wartime system, and formulated a proposal to reform the provincial and county-level local organs, which is being gradually implemented. At the same time, in order to cope with the price problem, the salaries of civil servants have been increased by five to six times, and measures such as the allocation of cheap rice are being implemented. Politically speaking, China can now be divided into three forces: the National Government forces, the Communist forces, and the Chongqing forces. Because the National Government has concluded an alliance with Japan, it has been working hard to reform political organs, especially the local and police organs, which have been improved to the greatest extent. At the same time, 26 influential figures from the Shanghai financial and intellectual circles have been appointed as consultants to answer government questions and offer suggestions for the implementation of spontaneous policies. It is expected that the implementation of the new policy in one year will achieve the expected results, and it is believed that the relationship between China and Japan will become closer in the future. I will also devote all my efforts to advancing this forward and achieving the desired results.</p>
<h3>Elite Troops of the Japan-India Allied Forces Launch a General Offensive on All Fronts; Enemy Counterattack Near Kohima is Repulsed</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) After receiving new support from the Kuki area, the enemy forces in the Palel area attempted a desperate resistance. The elite troops of the Japan-India Allied Forces, with the cooperation of the Japanese Air Force, launched a general offensive on all fronts at dawn on the 11th. During the battle, large formations of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Senaam, Andro, Ramkhankuno, and Hill 5815, as well as the enemy's wheeled positions on the south side of the road in that area, inflicting great losses. In particular, the 20th Division's combat headquarters in Senaam was bombarded with heavy bombs like rain, and its barracks and other facilities were hit and caught fire, throwing the enemy's central command apparatus into confusion. Taking advantage of the confusion of the enemy forces, the elite troops of the Japan-India forces immediately began their general offensive. A unit of the Japanese army advanced to the edge of a certain base east of Hill 5185 on the morning of the 12th, pressing the enemy's positions from the south. Meanwhile, the main force of the Japanese army from the Tanknu Bal area heavily bombarded the enemy airfield in Palel, throwing the enemy forces into great confusion. At around 7:00 AM on the 11th, 15 British soldiers, using Gurkha soldiers as a vanguard, attempted to escape, but they were discovered by the Japanese army and completely annihilated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indian front, the enemy forces, in an attempt to recapture Kohima, launched an offensive with more than ten medium tanks under the cover of the air force on the morning of the 12th, approaching the Japanese army's strong positions on the Kohima Heights. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, four of the tanks were destroyed. Meanwhile, the Japanese army concentrated its fire, achieving considerable results in attacking the enemy forces on the north side of Kohima (Hill 512) on the 12th and 13th. It is estimated that the enemy forces left behind 210 bodies. The Japanese army captured one enemy heavy mortar and six tanks. On the 12th, more than a hundred British and Gurkha soldiers attempted to infiltrate the vicinity of Narelma and Keseinama, east of Narelma, but they were raided by the Japanese garrison unit on the evening of the same day and routed. On the other hand, 200 enemy soldiers infiltrated the vicinity of Kisuma on the 12th, where they built positions, plotting to advance north to Kohima, but after being strongly attacked by the Japanese garrison unit, they suffered heavy blows and the enemy forces fled to the north. The Japanese army stationed there is now pursuing these fleeing enemy forces and is still encircling them north of Narelma. In addition, the enemy forces that invaded the Bakzumi and Ziguzmi areas are now gathering the remnants of the defeated army in the vicinity, hastily plotting to launch an offensive, and attempting to advance westward with aerial resupply and mortar cover. After being intercepted by various units of the Japanese army, these enemy forces have been doomed to annihilation.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) The enemy forces' counterattack on Kohima from the Indian side is becoming increasingly fierce, with reinforcements being continuously sent from Dimapur. Three brigades and one battalion are deployed near Hill 7522 near Taosu Ma, and a combined mechanized division and independent tank squadron are concentrated north of Zupsa, launching counterattacks against the Japanese army's positions every day. The counterattack on the 460-mile-high target height was the most fierce. At the dawn of the 11th, after a two-hour artillery bombardment, the enemy forces attacked with more than 20 tanks and armored vehicles. The Japanese army responded with anti-tank guns, destroying nine armored vehicles, repelling the main force of the enemy forces, and then attacking the remaining enemy forces in their southwestern positions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ba Heng Announces the Mission of the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Mr. Ba Heng, the head of the Burmese investigation team, paid his respects to the Japanese Emperor at 10:30 AM on the 18th. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, he met with a group of reporters and stated the following: When I visited the palace, I was honored to be received by the Emperor and to have a glimpse of his holy appearance. I felt extremely honored. At the same time, I was asked about various issues in Burma, and I am deeply grateful for the Emperor's genuine concern for Burma. The mission of our investigation team is to investigate the facilities for defending the country and the various situations of reconstruction and construction in the countries of Greater East Asia. Currently, Burma is located at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War, and is constantly subjected to enemy air raids. Japan has provided military assistance in this regard. At the same time, Burma has selected promising young people to send to Japan to study, hoping that they will become the backbone officers of the national army. Regarding civilian defense, the Japanese neighborhood association system is being emulated, with ten households forming a unit, and one household as the leader, responsible for firefighting and the rescue of the wounded. Currently, Burma is just embarking on the path of recovery, so it is expected that the advanced countries of Greater East Asia will provide guidance to strengthen national power. This is not only true for the army, but also for the active construction of the navy. At the same time, post-war recovery and construction are also important issues. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we have come to Japan to conduct an investigation. The most important thing is to investigate various facilities for completing the Greater East Asia War, so that we can learn from it and form a direction for building a strong country.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Two Important Tasks; Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education received Chinese and foreign reporters on the 18th, and Wang Yifang, Director of the Social Education Department, explained two important tasks of the ministry: Actively focusing on national health education, it has issued an order to hold sports meets in various provinces and cities. Jiangsu, Shanghai, and North China have already held them, and other provinces and cities are actively preparing. The second meeting of the Physical Education Committee was held on March 15 this year, and the results were satisfactory. For this year's Children's Day, it has been decided to promote the work of children's health and sports centers and has been ordered to comply with it. Currently, children's health competitions are being held across the country. The Ministry of Education has established a Medical Education Committee, which held its first meeting in Nanjing on April 24 this year, resolving to cultivate medical talents. Medical colleges and independent colleges focus on the fundamental issues of quality education. Nationally designated textbooks have already been published, and high school textbooks are being compiled. The printing of textbooks for the fall semester this year has been planned.

<h3>Communist Representative Lin Zuhan Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatches, according to Chongqing news arriving here, reporters from Chongqing and foreign reporters flew to the Red capital Yan'an on the 17th. It is also reported that before the reporters set off, Chiang Kai-shek expressed his hope that they would stay in Yan'an for at least two months to conduct a detailed investigation report on the various criticisms made by foreigners recently on the issue of Chongqing-Communists. The reason is that the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly stated to Chongqing that in order for the United Kingdom and the United States to strengthen their aid to Chongqing, the prerequisite must be that Chongqing unifies the domestic battle line and requires the Chongqing Communists to compromise. Therefore, the purpose of this trip of the reporters is actually related to this. Since the beginning of this year, the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly requested to send a group of reporters to Yan'an for inspection, but Chiang was afraid that comparing Chongqing under the Kuomintang dictatorship with Yan'an, which has largely formed a political system, would expose his own weaknesses. Therefore, he has not yet agreed. But in the end, it has attracted fierce criticism from the United Kingdom and the United States on Chongqing's dictatorship. Chiang was forced to appoint Wang Shijie as his representative on May 2 to discuss with Lin Zuhan, chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government, the communist representative, in Xi'an to discuss specific measures for foreign reporters to inspect Yan'an, and general issues of adjusting Chongqing-Communist relations. Although the adjustment of Chongqing-Communist relations is still difficult, the fact that foreign reporters can make the trip this time, even if it is said that Chongqing has made concessions, at least means that Chongqing and the Communists have begun to approach each other. Furthermore, after the completion of the talks in Xi'an, Lin Zuhan arrived in Chongqing on the 17th and is scheduled to meet with Chiang in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Cotton Product Businesses Should Comply with Regulations for Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>The China-Japan Cotton Product Business Federation previously agreed on a draft of the regulations for sellers of cotton products, which must be followed by all members of the industry associations or cooperatives affiliated with the Federation.

<h3>Madame Ding Pan's Birthday Celebrations Aid Social Welfare Undertakings</h3>

The 24th of this month is the 70th birthday of his virtuous mother, Madame Pan.

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy's Remarks Not Worth a Scholar's Smile: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, who met with reporters on the 17th, said when referring to the Pacific war situation: "In the northern, central, and southern parts of the Pacific, US air forces are constantly attacking the Japanese defense line from the Kuril Islands to the Marshall Islands to the Bismarck Islands at any time and place. It has now become nominal. The US Air Force and fleet are currently conducting vigorous operations within this outer line of 1,500 miles. Therefore, the remaining Japanese bases on Truk Island, Ponape Island, and the Marshall Islands urgently need the support of friendly forces from the south." This statement only provides a superficial overview of the current situation of the Pacific War and lacks any new understanding. However, the new Secretary of the Navy made this statement in order to gain public trust, so as to give the impression that the US military is actively engaged in combat. However, from the Japanese perspective, this statement is not worth a scholar's smile. Colonel Matsushima Keizo, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, made the following criticism when he met with reporters yesterday regarding the US Secretary of the Navy's explanation.</p>
<p>Few Gains for Major Sacrifices</p>
<p>Since the start of the counteroffensive operation in the Solomon Islands in August 1942, in these twenty-one months, the area gained by the US military at any cost is only the outer circle of our defense of East Asia. The US military is now using these bases as a foothold, eyeing the opportunity to break into the Japanese defense line, but this is certainly not easy. Although the US military has seized land, it must deploy strong forces to make the bases functional. The enemy has not yet deployed sufficient forces today, so their position is by no means solid. If the Japanese army rises up once, it will be effortless to regain these places. The enemy frequently launches attacks relying on its material superiority, but the Japanese army remains calm and intercepts them.</p>
<p>Enemy's Weakness is Difficulty in Supply</p>
<p>US Army Lieutenant Colonel Canon Mo has also said that war cannot be won solely by relying on resources. Although the United States boasts of its strong productivity, it still feels that its human resources are insufficient. The recent mobilization of 2 million women in the United States can further serve as proof of this. Conversely, Japan still has ample human resources. Secondly, the more the enemy expands the battle line, the longer the supply line of the logistics station becomes, which causes the greatest weakness. Even if there is a supply base like Australia, it cannot take care of the overall situation of the Pacific War by relying solely on that place. Japan's supply line is shorter than the enemy's, which is a real advantage. The damage caused by enemy submarines to Japanese maritime transportation routes has also been significantly reduced due to the appropriate countermeasures taken by the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Confident in the Future of the War Situation</p>
<p>Third, from a military demand perspective, modern warfare is a total war of the nation, and the amount of military production can control the war situation. However, due to the efforts of the entire Japan, the production of aircraft, ships, fuel, etc. is progressing daily, especially aircraft production, so Japan has no anxiety in this regard. When we think in this way, we can understand that Japan has confidence in the future of the Pacific War. The Japanese garrison troops in Truk, Ponape, the Marshall Islands, and other places are still safe and sound. The current lull in the war in that area is due to Japan's careful reorganization of the entire line. Now that the enemy will still launch a desperate counteroffensive, but once the Japanese army is ready, the enemy will suffer a major blow.</p>

<h3>Economic Commentary: The Real Enemy of the Securities Market</h3>
<p>Who is the real enemy of the securities market? In a word, it is the speculators in the securities market who "use all means, disregard the public, harm others and benefit themselves, and only seek personal gain." The departure from normality of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Market - the crazy rise and fall of securities prices - can be said to have been entirely caused by these people. They will do everything possible to push up prices when the securities market is booming, regardless of causing chaos, and they will do everything possible to suppress prices when the securities market is shrinking, regardless of harming others. Although the means they take are completely opposite, their goals are the same: to use the sweat and blood of the public to provide for their games and enable them to obtain huge profits.</p>
<p>During the period when Chinese securities prices rose wildly and endlessly last year, we also pointed out the dangers caused by securities speculation. In the current miserable environment where the Chinese securities market has slumped, we must of course also point out the dangers caused by securities speculation. What is the danger this time? It is that the vast majority of well-meaning retail investors in society, who usually rely on securities investment to protect or supplement their lives, have suffered unnecessary losses (because the prices of several stocks have been suppressed by short sellers to less than one-fifth of their asset value) due to the rampant and widespread short selling in the Shanghai stock market, and their lives have been seriously affected. What is particularly noteworthy is that some financial institutions are using stocks mortgaged by others to participate in short selling speculation. This trend should not be allowed to continue, otherwise the entire financial market will perish together. It is hoped that the authorities will severely crack down on it!</p>

<h3>The Shenbao Weekly - The Firm and Unyielding Inner South Seas Fortress of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Since the US military's invasion of the Marshall Islands at the end of January, the powerful mobile units have appeared in Truk in mid-February, and then attempted actions in the Mariana Islands at the end of the same month. By the end of March, they had even penetrated deeper into the Western Caroline Islands. Their intentions are self-evident. Although they have suffered repeated blows and setbacks, they continue to deploy powerful forces in all directions. Their tenacious ambition and vigorous fighting spirit are certainly not to be underestimated. But what have they ultimately gained from these offensives?</p>
<p>The Japanese army has not been misled by these mobile tactics, but correctly grasps the true nature of the current stage of the Pacific War. It neither overestimates nor undervalues the effects of the US military offensives. Each Japanese base in the Pacific stands resolutely, awaiting the air raids of the US military and its aircraft.</p>
<p>Ocean Fortress - The main force of the US military in the Central Pacific is, of course, mobile units centered on aircraft carriers. Their advantage lies in their ability to move quickly across the vast Pacific Ocean, acting as mobile air bases, and thus being able to temporarily concentrate a significant number of air forces to launch aerial offensives. However, the nature of aircraft carriers ultimately limits them in time. For maintenance reasons, they must return to base after a certain number of days. The US military, attempting to break through the central part of the Japanese Pacific defense line through mobile warfare, must advance their fleet bases and supply bases for the reasons mentioned above. In this regard, the various Japanese bases in the Inner South Seas and Central Pacific, which stand as obstacles to US ambition, are in fact ocean fortresses and are extremely important.</p>
<p>Air Force Fierce Battle - The US military's primary objective in its offensive is to eliminate the Japanese bases' air power. However, due to the inherent limitations of their own base air power, they have had to rely solely on mobile air power. For the Truk Islands, which are within the bombing range of large aircraft, they use base air power for containment bombing. For the distant Mariana Islands and Western Caroline Islands, they repeatedly deploy mobile air power in an attempt to destroy the Japanese base network. In the South Pacific, the US military's mobile air power, which was originally an assistant to base air power, is now taking the lead, challenging the Japanese positions. Thus, the war situation presents a picture of fierce battles between US mobile air power and Japanese base air power.</p>
<p>Fireworks Air Raids - Although air raids carried out by mobile units can concentrate a considerable amount of air power at one time, the results are also temporary and lack continuity. Like fireworks, they explode and disappear in an instant. In the Central Pacific, although the US military has repeatedly carried out mobile air raids, the actual damage they have inflicted on Japanese bases is minimal. Even continuous heavy bombing of Rabaul by the enemy has not been able to stop the functions of the Japanese forward base. Moreover, Japanese transport planes, with thin armament, are able to overcome extraordinary difficulties and take off and land quite frequently. The effectiveness of mobile air raids can be imagined. The fireworks air raids of the US military at most leave some holes on the ground that can be filled.</p>
<p>Digging Their Own Graves - On the contrary, these offensives by the US military are an excellent opportunity for the Japanese army to smash the US "aircraft carrier fleet." The Japanese army's clever tactic of luring the enemy deep inflicts heavy blows on the US mobile units each time. When US aircraft drop bombs with little effect and blindly fire machine guns, their home, where they must return, becomes an easy target for Japanese torpedo bombers. They are, in effect, digging their own graves. Therefore, Japanese bases welcome air raids. This precisely illustrates that Japanese bases are by no means defensive bases, but offensive attack bases.</p>
<p>An air base has the superiority of being an unsinkable aircraft carrier. The enemy's air raid effect is extremely small, and actions such as mobile attacks that do not go hand in hand with conquest are like providing an opportunity for self-destruction. However, whether the Japanese base air power can fully exert its superiority and seize the opportunity to crush the enemy depends on the number of aircraft, the整備of the airfield - base network, and the supply ships that maintain these conditions. It would be a great pity to miss the opportunity to annihilate the enemy due to a lack of aircraft. It is essential to have a complete search plane to capture the enemy fleet's trace in the vast ocean. It is essential to strengthen the attack plane that sinks the enemy fleet with a single stroke. As for the fighter plane that intercepts the enemy plane or guards the attack team, if it only has excellent performance and outstanding skills, it will not be at a disadvantage when dealing with several enemy planes and will not be shot down in air combat. However, it will be difficult if ammunition runs out while shooting down two, three, or four enemy planes. The number of enemy planes that one aircraft can handle has its limit. There is nothing more difficult than fighting a desperate battle with the few against the many in air combat.</p>
<p>Strengthening Bases - The activity of aircraft depends on the整備of the airfield. If one or two airfields cannot be used temporarily due to enemy bombing, it is not a problem if there is a nearby airfield. Furthermore, the number of aircraft that an airfield can accommodate has a certain limit, similar to an aircraft carrier. Of course, the current Japanese bases have not wavered, and are waiting in readiness to strike the powerful mobile units of the US military. However, in order to make Japanese aircraft more effective and to expand the scale of the air force, no matter how many aircraft there are, there will not be too many. The整備of airfields and base groups. For the enemy forces that are mobile in the vast Pacific Ocean, these bases, like a network of organically organized meshes, must be further strengthened. This must be done quickly, and the mechanization of its construction must be promoted. It goes without saying that the vital path of base air power relies on the continuous arrival of supply ships.</p>
<p>Vigorous Fighting Spirit - The US military, which has seriously engaged in the decisive battle on the Pacific front, will certainly repeatedly launch offensives, even if it suffers wounds, and its speed will also accelerate. Therefore, the speed of base combat power enhancement must be faster than that. Leaving aside the actual application of super-large aircraft such as the B29, the advancing US mobile units may attempt to air raid Japan itself. They are also considering various tactics. However, the damage from air raids is minimal with a prepared soul. For the Japanese mainland, which is a large air base, the US military's fireworks-style mobile air raids are an excellent opportunity to uproot and annihilate the enemy. The defense of the mainland lies in maximizing the function of the production base and even the large offensive base. The structure for dealing with air raids is not defensive, but persistently offensive. If this can be done, a vigorous fighting spirit to welcome air raids will naturally emerge.

<h3>The US Military's Troubles in a Protracted War: Sacrifice and Fear of Losing Time</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 18th</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from a Japanese base on the South Pacific front, the United States is currently struggling in the dilemma of a protracted war, weighing the hope of a short-term conclusion against the terror of large-scale sacrifices. In order to achieve a quick end, they must concentrate their forces, but concentrating forces requires sacrificing personnel. Although the United States is striving to replace the loss of personnel with material resources, when the substitution exceeds a certain limit, the disintegration and imbalance of combat power will follow. Is it to gain time or avoid losses? The two cannot be reconciled, frustrating the politicians in the White House. Therefore, they believe that the most brilliant guiding operational policy that should be adopted at present is to conduct a trial sniper attack in the Central Pacific in mid-March. Nimitz is strategizing in the Northern Pacific, and MacArthur is coordinating in the Southern Pacific, both showing a clear intention to act in unison. Thus, they have repeatedly attacked Japanese fortresses in the Central Pacific, and launched counter-offensive operations in New Guinea and the South Pacific. In late March, they boasted that landing a small number of troops on a small island north of New Britain Island was quite an achievement. MacArthur then announced that "the Bismarck Archipelago operation is completely over." This kind of propaganda is an attempt to cover up the United States' greatest weakness, the extreme fear of depleting personnel, which goes without saying. The San Francisco radio station broadcast that "it is impossible to attack Rabaul from the front sea surface because the human losses are too great." This inadvertently exposed the inside story of MacArthur's statement. Until now, the US military's usual tactics are still like the Solomon Islands, specializing in setting up landing bases in places with few or even no garrison troops. This is just to avoid human losses to a certain extent. The US military is deeply aware that this tactic will not work when approaching the Japanese army's important front line. Therefore, the enemy has had to compete for time with the massive consumption of personnel. The closer they get to the Japanese front line, the more urgently the enemy competes for time to get closer to the Japanese mainland. Their contradiction of fearing both losing time and hurting people is becoming increasingly profound. Although the enemy's leaders are striving to control war-weariness, and even send wounded soldiers from the Solomon Islands and New Guinea front lines to Australia for treatment only, daring not send them elsewhere, various tragic facts, such as US troops panicking and wailing when encountering Japanese attacks, firing automatic rifles randomly, and many US soldiers' lower limbs completely rotting in the dense forests and wetlands, have been transmitted to the United States from various sources, creating an aversion to war among the American people. In the near future, if the enemy attacks the strong Japanese inner defense lines with great force, causing heavy casualties, the world will deeply understand the kind of significant confusion that the direct action of "hurting people" and "competing for time" has brought to the US military's guiding war policy.</p>
<h3>European Fortress in Strict Readiness</h3>
<p>The large triangle of 4,000 kilometers in Western Europe, 2,000 kilometers in Eastern Europe, and 3,000 kilometers in Southern Europe - the "European Fortress" - is filled with an atmosphere of "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the tower." The Soviet army's major counter-offensive, which peaked with the Battle of Crimea starting on April 8, has come to an end since mid-April, and it seems to be focused on preparing for future offensives. The Anglo-American air force's aerial offensive is also intensifying in coordination. Its targets are in various parts of northern France and the suburbs of Paris, as well as various parts of Belgium, especially the transportation hub centered on Brussels. Not only are there German rocket-type long-range artillery positions in that area, but US military commentator George Elliott also stated that its main purpose is to make the German army retreat from its forward positions.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Military Strength - According to observations by relevant personnel, the enemy's invading forces total 30 divisions, with 28 to 30 US divisions, 5 divisions of the Canadian army, Polish exile army, and other refugee armies, totaling 62 to 65 divisions, including 5 airborne divisions.</p>
<p>The details of the German army's interception preparations are unknown. According to British newspaper speculation, there are 150 to 170 divisions. These include 10 divisions in Norway, 15 divisions in Denmark and Poland, 10 divisions in northern Germany, 50 divisions in the French, Belgian, and Dutch areas, 10 divisions in Italy, 10 divisions in the Balkans, and 45 divisions of reserve forces waiting in the homeland.</p>
<p>Fortress Arrangement - The arrangement of the so-called "Atlantic Defense Line" stretches from the North Cape at the northern tip of Norway to the Pyrenees Mountains in the south. Along the 4,000-kilometer coastline, there are 7,700 heavy guns (including long-range guns), 3,000 anti-tank guns, and millions of mines laid at sea. More than ten fortress positions have been built on important coasts, all of which are cement and steel structures, 6 to 10 kilometers long. Between these main fortresses are countless small fortresses, artillery positions, machine gun emplacements, special fire nets, etc. Heavy guns and railway guns can be moved to any location immediately along the railway. Hundreds of thousands of workers sweated for three years to build a solid defense wall 170 kilometers south of the Strait of Dover. The fortress line in Southern Europe connects the Pyrenees, Alps, and Balkan Mountains, extending directly to the Dodecanese Islands.</p>
<p>In addition, Germany has manufactured a large number of new sharp aircraft groups, waiting in underground airports. No matter which side the enemy begins its offensive from - Southern France, Northern Italy, the Balkans, or Northern Europe - the German army is in strict readiness. Opening the second front for Britain and the United States is a great opportunity to seize the initiative of the offensive from the enemy.

<h3>Scattered Memories Like Morning Stars</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhenjia</p>
<p>If people cause their parents to grieve, this is truly an unforgivable sin! Whenever I can't sleep at night, I remember my father and mother. I remember when I was a very young child, my mother missed my father who was far away. She would rest her cheek on my head, hold my hands, and gently call me:</p>
<p>"Little Shibao! Good baby! Mother wants to see you when she's lonely. Don't leave your mom!"</p>
<p>But for the sake of life, I left her when I was twelve years old. Sometimes, I imagine her leaning against the window, looking at the moon in her hometown, missing her beloved son who is drifting far away. I also seem to hear her sigh, tears streaming down her face. I also imagine on desolate autumn wind and rain nights, she lights the lamp alone and sits quietly. Whenever I am sick and lying in bed, my head is very dizzy, and I also seem to hear my mother's voice, coming from all directions, gently and lovingly calling me: "Little baby! Good baby!… Little baby! Good baby!..." ×…×…×…×…×…</p>
<p>I also remember my father. He was a thoughtful person. He had deep thoughts and deep eyes.</p>
<p>My hometown is the place where I grew up, and it is always filled with my memories. The small river flowing in front of the door, when spring comes, the spring water rises, carrying green duckweed, flowing, flowing to the endless distance, and the realm where it merges with the sky. In the light moonlight of autumn, it is truly a river of the soul! On early summer mornings, sunlight fills the countryside. The wide fields are covered with purple alfalfa. In the place with many trees, lives Yi Hong, the little girl who was my little lover at that time. Crossing the small stream in her house is the famous Xin Stream. On summer nights, fireflies fly over the river and back, resting on the reeds by the river. How they used to attract me and her!</p>
<p>My father didn't allow me to go see her. We made an appointment to take a walk in the woods, but I secretly ran to give her bird eggs and wild fruits. We sang and walked. One day, my father found out and became furiously angry. He grabbed me and beat me with a wooden stick, regardless of my head, hands, or body. His rude appearance made my mother cry.</p>
<p>"You're hurting him! You're going to beat him to death!…" my mother cried, but my father continued to beat me at will, and said:</p>
<p>"Who taught you these things? Who taught you these things?" My father locked me in a low, old, dirty room for firewood. He himself paced outside, heavily coming; heavily going. But I was sadly crying inside:</p>
<p>"Father!… You beat me!… Father! You beat me mercilessly when you were angry!…"</p>
<p>My father sighed outside the door. Finally, he came and opened the door. He pinched my ear and dragged me to the back of the house, caressing the places where his stick had injured me. They were swollen with red and green. He took his clothes and wiped away my tears, returning to the same loving demeanor as before, perhaps even more amiable. He comforted me and whispered</p>
<p>"Child! Do you hate me?" Hate your dad?" He looked at me like he was begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>"I don't hate Dad!" I said, crying.</p>
<p>"Silly child! Do you think Yi Hong is beautiful? Are you very fond of her? You're wrong! What makes her beautiful is the money in her family! Her father stripped the poor people of their clothes, and took away their bowls and chopsticks. He himself has become very rich, and his daughter has become beautiful… But, my child, you have things to do. You have to strive, your future, child!… Child!…" I raised my head and looked at my dad. Dad was sitting on a rock. He hugged my head and neck. My face was against Dad's face. My hands were around Dad's chest. My heart and Dad's heart beat together. Then he slowly asked me again:</p>
<p>"Child! Do you still hate Dad?"</p>
<p>"No!" I said: "Dad: Let's hug like this forever." Later, my father left his hometown. The whip of life lashed at him, driving him to a place of hardship. There, his coffin was quietly transported back. His grave was soon chosen by rabbits, and they made holes in it.</p>
<p>I also remember my old maid in my childhood, I called her Grandma Hao. She supported her decrepit, hunched body, working under the stove in the kitchen. She was my grandmother's maid and had been in service for a long time and was aging.</p>
<p>"Grandma Hao!" I said: "Where are your sons? Your daughters? Won't they take you back and give you blessings to enjoy?"</p>
<p>Words like mine were the most upsetting for her. She was such an old woman, desolate and lonely in her old age! Now I realize why the words "son" and "daughter" together form the word "good". But there are also people in the world who cause their parents to grieve.</p>
<p>"After Grandma Hao dies, will you remember Grandma Hao?" she asked me, her heart envying the elderly who had good children.</p>
<p>"Yes! Of course!" I answered casually. This made her smile bitterly, perhaps a sincere smile, the wrinkles on her face becoming even more wrinkled. Later, she fell ill and lay in bed. My mother told me to go to my aunt's house. When I came back, the door of the room where she slept had been tightly closed. I never saw her again. I secretly peeked through the cracks. The room was filled with emptiness, loneliness, and an indescribable terror.</p>
<p>These scenes have been lingering in my heart. I thought: If I don't struggle, don't strive, and die naturally, what will happen to my mother? She will also go to someone's house to be a maid, and then grow old and die with endless secret regrets!</p>
<p>When disease struck, I lay in bed, seemingly seeing the hand of death reaching out to me in the darkness, just like it reaches out to other people, like it reached out to my dad, especially smiling, enticingly saying:</p>
<p>"Come on, come on, give me your pain and other misfortunes!" But then, I heard my mother's voice, and I saw my father's deep eyes.</p>
<p>People! Think about it, when everyone rejects you, curses you, do your parents accept you, comfort you with a renewed expression of energy? When others sneer at you, do your father and mother still love you, using their tears to wash away your misdeeds, their hearts carrying more sorrow than yours?</p>
<p>I am alive, I am striving, I want to comfort my lonely mother, I want to comfort my lonely mother!</p>
<p>Each time, on nights with good moonlight, I think more about the sound of frogs in my hometown. They are croaking in the distance or nearby, and my lonely soul is humming:</p>
<p>"The spring breeze has turned the grass green again south of the Yangtze River, when will the bright moon shine on my return?"</p>

<p>— Cheng Qi</p>
<p>I am traveling in the desert:</p>
<p>The wind rings the camel bells,</p>
<p>The rain soaks my clothes,</p>
<p>How uncomfortable and frightened I am;</p>
<p>But I have to rush towards my future. I am traveling in the desert. I see no old friends around, nor water, green grass. How lonely and desolate I am! But I still have to rush towards my future. I have driven for so many miles on the endless Gobi Desert and still see no stream. I am dying of thirst! My feet cannot stop, I faint. A drizzle wakes me up. I immediately forget my fatigue and rush towards my path again.</p>

<h3>Review of "Blood Splattered Hibiscus"</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>Discussion of the Story</p>
<p>This is a Manchukuo detective film about a anti-smuggling squad cracking down on a smuggling ring dealing with opium.</p>
<p>The story is intertwined with suspense and twists, but it still maintains a degree of realism. There is a beautiful young woman who, addicted to smoking, has no choice but to fall into a trap, risking her life to obtain a few taels of opium; there are cunning and ruthless criminals who slaughter each other for their own interests; there is a fallen hero who repents, but the day he turns from evil to good is the day he dies; there is a vigilant police officer, Da Gemen, on the grasslands; and a touch of light romance is woven in. Some of the plot points are quite imitative of American martial arts films.</p>
<p>To use a trendy saying, releasing a film with such content during a time when gambling, dancing, and drugs are being strictly prohibited is quite appealing. That's what I thought at first. But after seeing the ending of the story, I couldn't help but feel a sense of absurdity; it turns out that the ultimate purpose of the final showdown, which even left the young anti-smuggling officer Yang Guobao seriously injured, was to rescue a train carrying "government-purchased opium"! The conclusion is truly worth reconsidering. Having clearly explained the dangers of opium at the beginning (in a speech in the film), which must be strictly hunted down, why is there still "government-purchased opium"? Is providing "government-purchased opium" the only way to save those gentlemen who have had their private opium smuggling routes cut off? Then, what exactly does "drug prohibition" mean? Is it prohibiting "smoking opium" or prohibiting "private opium smuggling"? It is easy for people to have such [questions].</p>
<p>Perhaps the screenwriter was limited by the conventions of formulaic stories, and had to use the contrast between "private" destruction and "public" to emphasize that the criminals deserved to die, and to lure them into a trap. But this still cannot conceal the fact that the "government-purchased opium" plot, in addition to inciting anger, does no good; and that they are about to escape abroad, but are willing to escape a little slower in order to vent their resentment, which leads to their being pursued by the police, is extremely unworthy. Even if it is necessary to have the villains caught, it would be acceptable to embolden the smugglers a little, not to escape, or to destroy any other public undertaking (although such a conclusion would not be good either), but why specifically with "government-purchased opium"? What do the experts think? Artistic Achievement</p>
<p>This is the first time I have watched a film from Manchukuo. Although there have been a few that have come to Shanghai before, I am ashamed to say that I have never had the chance to appreciate them. But this first impression is the clever application of many new techniques that are not often seen in Chinese films. This is something that our beloved Shanghai directors should study.</p>
<p>"Counterpoint music," which was already being used in Europe eleven years ago, is still quite a novel thing in China today. When someone is speaking or giving a speech, the camera does not have to be limited to the speaker or the assembly, but can be moved at any time to another place that suits the mood? Clever symbolism, such as blooming flowers (unfortunately, it is not clear what kind of flowers they are) representing love, and wringing a handkerchief displaying inner distress, and falling flowers representing the passing of a pure soul; especially several scenes of description and narration, are simply prose; the many beautiful images accompanying the scenes are adjectives - but they are also as difficult to understand as prose, and almost all require the audience to use their thinking.</p>
<p>The plot is very concise, without the drawbacks of being dragging and repetitive. Especially the ending technique has a lingering sound and charm. But because it is too concise, the adjectival scenery almost all flashes by in an instant, making it difficult for people to understand. Shanghai audiences, who are not used to bringing their thinking brains to the cinema, find it even more difficult to understand. Therefore, it is natural that it is not popular.</p>
<p>As for the dubbing, it is not flattering. It commits the same mistake as most Chinese films, which is inaccurate dubbing, thus creating a dual nature of sub-voice, becoming a soundless movie with pressure, which is really uncomfortable to watch.</p>
<p>I hope other Manchukuo films will give me a better impression.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Open Women's Basketball Championship: The Green Team Has Complete Talent; All Teams Participating in the League Have Improved</h3>
<p>This year's Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament included a women's competition, allowing eager warriors to fulfill their long-cherished wish. As a result, as many as five teams participated. After more than two months of competition, the Dahua [大華] team was able to maintain an undefeated record, and the final was held this Monday (the 15th) at the YMCA gymnasium. The Green team lived up to expectations and ultimately won the championship with success in all aspects, with Dahua finishing as runner-up. First, I will describe the final game and comment on the success and failure of the two teams, and then make some post-war feelings.</p>
<p>The Arena is Unprecedentedly Lively and the Battle is Extremely Tense</p>
<p>There was only one final item this evening, and the audience reached more than a thousand people, which is enough to show that women's basketball has been popularized in all circles. It is by no means accidental that it has achieved this result. Both sides had cheering squads to help, with beautiful women yelling, and the lively situation can be called unprecedented. The competition went smoothly, and its spirit is worthy of praise. In the game, Dahua started strong and then declined. They initially had an absolute advantage of seven to one, but the Green team gradually caught up. In the end, they lost due to slightly less experience. The Green team won the championship with a score of twenty-two to fourteen, and became the female champion of this year. But the enemy also cost a lot of effort</p>
<p>The Green Team Has Outstanding Talent, Fierce Attack, and Strict Defense</p>
<p>The Green team's talent is made up of famous generals, and their individual skills are indeed above those of other teams. Moreover, they have the leadership of Xue Chunsheng and the guidance of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin, so their strategies in each game are quite handy and easy to maneuver. Talking about their offense, they mainly use blocking methods, use triangular passing to create gaps. Huang Mingyuan's fierce follow-up and Rong Shujian's fierce ball interception, and their short stature, enable them to make low passes. Its X-style attack is indeed powerful. When necessary, they can also use mid-range shooting, which can be said to be perfect. The only thing is that in the final game, they were too eager to win, and they were a little timid. Their signature move, the rapid breakthrough when serving, was not applied properly. It was also due to the importance of winning or losing the Er Biao [爾標] and lead to. As for their defense, they adopted man-to-man and rotating defense methods. The Green team's three guards, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yin Guan, were energetic, and their positions and angles were also well applied. Therefore, the results of the series of battles can be called Huaru Ruyi. Unfortunately, in the final game, they were too careful in the first half, which resulted in fewer good constructions and created a dull situation. In the second half, after the guidance, they were able to resume their activity, intercepting the ball and rushing to the front to transport it to the front, which was the main reason for the victory. Finally, the reporter observed that the most commendable thing about the Green team was the use of secret signals, which were extremely pure, effective, and the forwards and guards were able to complete their task. The only shortcoming is that the rotating defense method has not yet entered the hall, and there are a few loopholes.</p>
<p>Green Team's Complete Record Wins Three Provinces 37-16</p>
<p>Wins Overseas Chinese 34-14</p>
<p>Wins Kang'ai 55-11</p>
<p>Wins Liuhua 22-14</p>
<p>Dahua is a Rising Force, but It is a Pity That It Lacks Experience</p>
<p>The Green Dahua team is an emerging team, but with the enthusiasm of the organizer Yang Shuding and the guidance of Yu Juguang and Lu Zhongen, their progress has been rapid, showing high-speed development results, which is not an easy task. I believe that if you give it a considerable amount of time, the Green team may find it difficult to frustrate its edge. I encourage the Dahua soldiers! To discuss the way of offense and defense, it seems that there are many changes in its various battles, but in the final battle, it absolutely adopted the blocking method. Dao deeply knows that the Green team's guard is using man-to-man, and the man-to-man guard is most afraid of the blocking method. In the beginning, it was quite effective, and there was a way to attack. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan. Later, because they only knew the blocking method, and the other party had changed their strategy, they still stuck to their original intention and failed to make a sudden change in the battle. This is the lack of experience. It is a pity that it failed in the end, isn't it a pity? Dahua's defense is a three-person joint defense, which is to save physical strength and wait for work, and stop the enemy's front from rushing into the bottom line. The success of applying this method is that the Green team could not maneuver freely in the first half of this battle. It is a pity that it has always been like this, without any change, so it lost the right to win the ball invisibly, which also reduced its own offensive. San Dongque milk used its tall stature to prevent the Green team's sharp attack. However, the fierce breakthroughs of Huang Mingyuan and Rong Shujian were indeed powerful, which led to frequent fouls. In fact, it is impossible to take care of both, it is not a crime of war. Therefore, Dahua's defense has achieved the point of three-eight joint defense, but it is a pity that there is no change at all. Moreover, it is quite felt that the team should know how to overdo it and try long shots in the last quarter, which may be able to revive it. However, its consistent style is a mistake in quality. Finally, the team has a very obvious shortcoming, that is, the forward and the guard lack a point of contact, and the guard has a lack of clear understanding of the position (center line limit).</p>
<p>The League Ended Successfully and I Had Four Thoughts</p>
<p>This year's women's league has ended, and I can't help but have thoughts every time I participate in the viewing.</p>
<p>The participants in this event were the Green Team, Da Gehua Overseas Chinese Three Provinces Kang'ai Five Teams. In the process of the competition, each team has made great progress in each game, and the fun seems to be increasing. It can be seen that women's basketball can obviously have a vigorous atmosphere. Therefore, I think the authorities can try to hold a separate women's competition in the near future. The enthusiasm of the participants and the excitement of the players will surely exceed expectations. It is not necessary to wait silently for this day next year, which will allow the athletes to have fewer opportunities to learn from each other.</p>
<p>The five teams that participated in this event have good guidance, do their best to train during normal times, encourage and teach strategies before the game, and allocate the battle. This should be the best phenomenon in the game. The participants in this event all understand that the game is not necessarily a war of players, but it is indeed a war of guidance. Therefore, I hope that all the teams in Shanghai should have good guidance, then the level will definitely be improved.</p>
<p>The rules adopted for this women's competition are American rules, with the center line crossing the boundary restriction, which is based on women's physiological relationship and should not be too intense. However, considering that there is no restriction on women's rules in the world, and looking at the style of the women's army in this competition, I really agree that it is possible to try the men's rules, so as to have the power to exert its influence without restriction. Moreover, it is found that there is no distinction between men's and women's rules in North China and South China, and there has been more progress in the art of playing. Therefore, I think it is possible to try it in Shanghai. What do you think of the predecessors of the physical education?</p>
<p>In the final game, when the two teams tried to throw the ball, the Green team adopted a cross-shaped pass, which was beautiful and practical. Dahua also applied the basic front-guard try-throw, which is more preferable than the ordinary casual try-throw. In this kind of secret, all the abilities to come out of the box and win are the most effective way to improve the level, which is worthy of praise and emulation.</p>
