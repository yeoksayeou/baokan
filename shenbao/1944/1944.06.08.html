<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">社會事業 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>社會事業和國家事業不同，國家事業由國家組織，用國家公費。社會事業和私人事業不同，私人事業由私人管理，用私人金錢。社會事業的經濟來源純由社會上私人的捐助，所以不是國家事業。社會事業的組織管理由社會人士共同合作，所以也不是私人事業。近來上海社會上，提倡建設的風氣極濃厚，這是人類互助心的表現，是上海人關心上海地方事務的開始。戰亂以來，上海所有的社會事業，有的已經毀滅了，有的已經停頓了，我們希望從今後，把毀減的復興起來，把停頓的重新進行，更要把以往所不能够辦到的創造起來，這樣，上海人方才對得起上海，上海方才能够做全國的表率。</p>
<p>社會事業的重要性，不必我們多說。可是社會事業的主要原則，就在永久繼續。社會是一個永久繼續的有機體，社會事業亦應當替社會繼續不斷的服務。但是要使社會事業能得永久繼續，就需社會人士不斷的協助。要使社會人士不斷的協助，那末，社會事業本身先得表現出良好的成績。我們敢說，過去上海社會事業所以不能永久的原因雖然很多，但是大多因爲本身的成續不良，以致得不到社會上的協助。社會事業辦不好的緣故，不外兩點：一是組織，一是管理。我們主張，現下的社會事業，要健全中心組織，要專家管理。</p>
<p>任何事業的中心都在最高的組織，有健全的組織，然後能發生堅强的力量。社會事業完全依靠社會大衆的熱心，其最高組織至爲重要。組織人員的人格道德，素爲一般人所注意。組織人員的學識才具，更與寨業本身的進行相比例。我們認爲中心組織的作用，在立法，在監察，立法需要學識，監察需要道德。在這中心組織之中，至少有一二人聚精會神和各方面共同去硏究這個社會事業的進行方針，方針旣定，不再更動，就要託付專家執行管理，中心組織本身就站在監察地位，時常注意。</p>
<p>事業的應該專家化，已經成爲一般的原則。社會事業的性質不同，有救濟性的，有農業生產性的，有工商業生產性的，有敎育性的。各種性質不同的社會事業，需要各種專家去主持，主持一個社會事業是一件事務，不業一件政務，他只要實事求是去做事，不需要四面八方去應付。過去一般社會事業的主持人，每每忘了他的職務，或許因爲沒有規定他的戰務，常常各方奔走，以致貽誤內部工作，這是最最使不得的。社會事業需要專家管理，要專職，不能兼職；要集中全副精力去做，不能粉刷門面的敷衍了事。事粱的成續可以保障事業的永久存在，沒有成續的事業决不能永久存在，決不能得到社會人士永久的贊助。</p>
<p>以上兩點是社會事業進行上的基礎，希望熱心社會事業的諸先生們注意和指敎。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日大本營昨發表　五月份綜合戰果　墜毀敵機共計九百零八架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日下午五時三十分發表：日本睦海軍五月攻擊及邀擊敵空軍，收獲綜合戰果如次：　予敵方之損失南太平洋方面擊洛二二八架，擊毀百六十架。中太平洋方面擊落一百十三架，擊毀四十八架。緬甸方面擊落一百零七架，擊毀或起火焚燒者九十架（內有滑翔機四十餘架）。中國方面擊落四十五架（內不確者八架），擊毀或起火焚燒者一百十五架。北太平洋方面擊落一架，擊毀一架，以上合計九百零八架。　日軍損失自炸及未歸還者六十三架，又於地上損失四十八架，合計一百十一架。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日機六日夜曾進攻新幾內亞北岸茲庫迭島之敵空軍很據地，使其機塲及軍事設施等起火燬燒，日機則全體均安返基地。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日機四日下午於必阿克島海面，曾轟炸欲行出擊之敵艦隊，結果擊沉及擊毀其巡洋艦各一艘，同時並擊落其戰鬥機三架。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日軍對怒江西岸　開始總攻擊　降落摩寗傘兵已潰滅 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　怒江前綫日軍某基地電，向怒江西岸地區進攻之渝軍，目下僅賴空中輸送以維持其餘命，日軍有力諸部隊爲將之殲滅起見，特對其開始總攻擊，自五日起，日軍一部即急追渝第百三十師，現正向夜好寺及五一八六高地方面進攻。又其他一部扼制紅木樹，進攻長坡，以重壓渝軍，於總攻擊之前即三日日軍部隊首先對來襲冷水溝正面之渝軍予以重創，是役渝軍棄屍百四十五具，並有團長以下多人負傷。又日軍另一部隊，於丈交附近亦將渝軍殲滅，因此怒江西岸渝軍報回北部緬甸之企圓業遭粉碎，且受日軍之猛攻，補給路絕斷，已陷進退維谷之境。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據路透社訪員訊：反軸心軍降落傘部隊，在北部緬甸之摩肯西南及密芝那安達旦鐵道上之摩寗降落後，即遭日軍猛攻，陷於潰減、遂向北方密林地帶退走。據路透社訪員說明上項戰况稱：英軍降落傘部隊司令林丁少將指揮下之該方面降落傘部隊，係由古力兵及英人部隊所凑合而成者，經日軍有力部隊之包圍猛擊，未能作任何抵抗，並於二十七日被日軍步兵部隊短兵突入，而佔領該地機塲，於是敵補給路終被遮斷，而不得不由所據陣地撤退。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電　據福岡電，日崛末陸軍中士，前曾乘機活躍於南方戰塲，頃於六日午後乘機歸返福岡縣，暢談其繫沉潛艇之經過謂，余以四月某日赴美那多方面，担任諉衛船團之任務，在該方海面搜索敵軍，忽見白色之海面上有敵之潛影，細視之乃敵美之潛艇也。當時，我方船團在航行中，敵艇即擬實行雷擊工作，値此千鈞一髮之時，余乃急速改變方向，向敵潛艇加以猛襲，瞬間水花冲天，形成兩條水柱，所投炸彈有二發命中，敵潛艇漸沉沒海底，余飛至五〇〇米高度探視海面，見重油流滿海面，始知敵潛艇已確被擊沉，於完成任務後，乃再度保護航團前進</p>

<h3 id="c10">港粵間　貿易近况 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　以廣州爲中心之華南及查港方面之經濟現狀，自大東亞戰爭勃發後，經濟政治一體化之特色，益可顯見，同時更能排除因戰爭而發生之各種困難，向前發展。茲介紹各地現狀如次：香港方面由日軍佔領後，二年有半，其經濟動態，因貿易及造船業之發展，頓形活泌。香港港灣碼頭及各倉庫等，已充分發揮其功能，担當起華中·廣東·厦門·汕頭·海南鳥及菲鳥之貿易及日本·台灣·昭南·越南·泰國等，及南洋各地域間之物資交流。其中尤以對廣東貿易，更爲繁盛。一向徑由海上之運輸，去年十二月二十八日起，廣九路全綫開通後，陸路運輸亦已吿成。又三月二十五日決定之本年度廣東，香港間貿易協定，已規定港粵相互輸出額，廣東之輸出額爲六百萬元，香港輸出額爲千八百萬元，此外幷利用帆船，實施沿岸交易，香港及仰光各優秀造船所乙機械帆船，亦繼續入水，最近更有大型舟千　之木造船，開始動工建造。同時為協力南方各地之木船造船，香港總督部各南方軍政監部，並規定向各地供給造船工人。香港除造船外，其他工業如砂糖·烟草·馬尼刺繩。洋灰·酸素·製　·調味品·麥酒·淸凉食料·染料·等，亦均有相當進展。其原料自非島廣東緬甸等地輸入，製成後再輸往各地，故香港亦可稱為物質供給地。廣東方面佔經濟主要部分者爲手工業，其輸出品以蓆·土布·竹籐·細工等爲大宗。機械工業則無所出產。現廣東工塲總數爲四千六百零十家，其中華人經營者爲四千三百數十家，日人經營者三百家。然因戰局進展，船舶不足，及輸出市塲之變更等原因，其經營日趨不棍。爲期解決此種情形，廣支省府當局，亦按照日方整頓合併改檢停業等措置方針，努力華人工塲之整頓。四月八日，全國商業統制總會廣東分命成立以來，華方經濟界亦漸趨於統制之方式，並爲準備進行重要物資最高價格制，進而實施調查廣市庫存商品，已成立物資調查委員會，由省長担任委員長，以期澈底推行會　。此外金融方面，日方　銀行已規定非常時期儲蓄提款制，並廢止粵省海關物資輸出重複課稅制，用定轉口稅一次制等措置。海南烏方面最堪注目者，即豐富之鐵鑛，及他其島內運輸繼關之設備，及食糧增產等問題。此種問題因施策之適切，巳迎刃而解，同時該島治安，亦日趨良好，故均堪注目云。</p>
<h3 id="c11">郭培爾博士　論侵歐戰事　德靜待敵方悲慘結果 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德宣傳部長郭培爾，六日就反軸心軍於法國北岸登陸作戰事宣稱：吾等即行殲滅殺戰德國婦女之暴徒，吾等德人咸具如此之決意。此次作戰結果，當使驕傲之美。英國民受冷水澆頭之震驚，最後，英·美國人當知其國家宣傳之虛僞，而大感恐怖。敵方選擇遙遠期日開始作戰，今日實爲其重演四年前鄧扣克悲劇之日，吾等只靜待敵方之悲慘結果，敵方僅企圖佯動作戰，抑或眞抱實行大規模侵攻作戰之意圖，則待將來之發展評定。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德外交部發言人稱：無人能知昨夜所發動之侵歐戰事，何時能達到其高潮，但其對德有利之結果，早已成爲定論。德人對英·美終於開始其侵歐之企圖，表示滿意，德人對於此事，已等候甚久，而現於斯達林壓迫之下，侵歐遂吿實現，羅斯福總統亦需要侵歐成功，以爲其選舉運動之助。該發言人指出侵歐之前奏行動稱，在過去數月，對德國及全歐之神經戰及對歐洲之恐怖突襲，係企圖擊潰歐洲之民氣，但敵人未能使德人軟化也。德人於今日更具堅決之心理，以與敵人淸算舊賬，在目前係以武器為第一，而外交家及政治家當守緘默矣。</p>

<p>柏林七日中央社電　德軍當局宣稱：反軸心軍截至六日下午止，僅在克恩（Caen）附近，形一公里半之橋頭堡。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：此間軍事當局今晨透露：法西北沿岸刻正展開全面激戰，卡倫坦與伯約之間之敵軍，（該地區在法西北部凸入海峽地區）已被迫後進，奧納河口戰區巳登陸之敵軍巳被封鎖，但於强烈之砲火掩護下，敵正在獲得增援部隊。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　反軸心軍之歐洲登陸作戰，於六日最巳開始，首先於五日下午九時英國中央廣播電台即對法國廣播，要求海岸地帶三十五公里以內之婦孺立即撤退，繼則以轟炸機約一千架，對面向杜佛海峽之歐洲要塞作</p>
<p>集中轟炸</p>
<p>該轟炸至夜半更形激烈，轟炸面積，亦由海岸要塞擴大至後方德軍預備部隊之集合地點。夜一時半。反軸心軍之降落傘部隊，更於諾曼第半島西方之基賽及耶賽兩島降落，展開登陸作戰之企圖。旋英國第一六六降落傘師，於奧納河以西之務堡一帶降陸，美國第八十二，第一百十一降落傘及滑翔機，蔽空而下，發動確保登陸地點之作戰。</p>
<p>作戰重點</p>
<p>在巴魯福拉爾·克恩·西格尼及特魯維庫爾四地後更使降落傘部隊在該地附近海岸五公里以內之地區降落，發動掩護海上大軍登陸之作戰。時英美法等國之船艇及四千餘登陸用船舶，早已由加萊附近海面開至澤吉島集合，於英法海峽待機而動。七日上午五時半天色將明時，開始向降落傘部隊降落之地突進，同時小艦艇泰半均紛紛對海岸一帶展開炮擊，就中攻擊特魯維庫爾及巴魯福拉爾之左右翼，分別以戰艦六艘驅逐艦二十之</p>
<p>强力艦隊</p>
<p>作掩護炮擊，欲使德軍誇稱之大西洋要塞不得展其雄姿。炮聲隆隆中，海面上散在之無教三千噸級運輸船放出無數大小不一之登陸用快艇，冲破烟幕衝至岸邊，特別在奧納河及維爾河口使用扁底運輸艇溯流急上，逞型其突在德軍要塞地帶背後登陸之大胆戰術。對於此種正面攻擊之德軍，其水雷船即首先出動，不顧衆寡懸殊，不願砲火熾烈，奮勇突入敵軍船團，以水雷及</p>
<p>砲火猛攻</p>
<p>海岸砲亦集中砲火努力防禦，迄拂曉反軸心軍轟炸更猛之故，致使數處為反軸心軍之四十艘登陸小艇逼近登陸成功，且有重載車三十五輛開上海岸。時德軍後方預備部隊巳　反軸心軍空軍之轟炸，而開始集合。反軸心軍一降落傘聯隊開入德軍地雷陣，其全軍進即潰碎。巴魯福拉爾及塞納河奧納河地帶之反軸心軍降落傘部隊，於傍午即被德軍完全殲滅。德機動部隊更對由海上登陸約有七八師之英軍主力，開始作集中攻擊，在薄　將其</p>

<p>使其向來處　走截至六日七時僅奧納河夾岸縱深一公里半橫寬約五公里乃至十公里之一處，有反軸心軍一部隊强作抵抗，演奏其登陸作戰之獨脚戲。德軍當局謂其不一足稱為橋頭堡，僅可稱為登陸點，由此可知反軸心之登陸作戰，絕未曾收獲預期之成果。更可知反軸六日夜以後仍將依照規模極大之全盤登陸計劃，而繼續發動大攻勢。反軸心軍之企圖頗有欲先奪取大船可直接入港　岸之哈佛及頭堡兩港，繼於聖瑪洛方面登陸，於法國北部一鼓作氣，攪動決戰之勢，刻下成敗尙難逆料。</p>
<p>利用軟梯冒險登陸</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：頃悉反軸心軍登陸主要中心，似在塞納河口西部聖伐斯脫與克恩迤北十哩之沃伊斯脫罕之間，登陸船及襲擊艇多艘，均於此間靠岸，同時昨午瑟堡半島（克恩西一北二十公里）阿洛滿區海岸，有敵船二百艘駛來。登陸已否尙未獲悉。反軸心軍企圖利用軟梯攀登此間險峻海岸。昨日英美坦克車輛亦於此間登陸，登陸各地高空有汽球多具，內中似有砲兵債察員，汽球四週，英美戰鬥機不斷往來旋繞。</p>

<p>侵歐軍隊編制情形</p>

<p>英美戰略聲東擊西</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德軍當局六日正午會見國際記者團時宣稱：反軸心軍展開西歐登陸作戰後，已經過相當時間，故該方面戰局亦漸已明瞭。查反軸心軍乃企圖在塞納河口至維爾河口百二十公里之正面，展開所謂海陸空攻勢。以上地區在杜佛海峽之海岸地帶中，距離巴黎最近。但德軍久己築有周密之防衛陣地，此在歐洲要塞中，以厚度及裝甲言，全為最堅固之地點，故反軸心軍根本未採直搗弱點之戰法，乃使用最危險之特別戰法。此次之作戰，乃為一種聲東擊西之戰法，因此反軸心軍或將企圖在其他地點登陸，亦未可知。</p>

<p>— 江亢虎</p>
<p>尊重固有文化</p>
<p>國於天地，必有與立，中國之所以為中國，中國人之所以為中國人，自有其歷史地理民族文化之特殊性。無論何種主義，何種政策，不能不承認此天然事實，為一切言論行動之先決問題。中國固有文化，即堯舜禹湯文武周公相承製，孔子孟子集大成，老莊楊墨名法諸家所稱道，十三經二十四史所記載，泰漢以來歷代君相師　嘉言懿行之昭示吾人者皆是。吾人若於此一切廢棄，則國將不國，人非其人，良法美意，舉無所用。故反共者必先知尊震我國有之文化，提高自尊心，養成自信力，務使中有所主，內容充實，則外來邪義自無問得入，雖有煽惑，不為動搖矣。吾人須知：中國文化，本有價値，東西學者，一致推崇，一也。中國文化，我所自造，運用得宜，最為合式，二也。中國文化，傳之日本，保存勿失，馴致當强，三也。又况信仰即是力量，吾人對中國文化起信仰心，賴此力量，自得救度，四也。中國文化不僅為中國人之中心思想，幷可作大東亞人之共同偌條。又可與西洋文化互相調　補充，創造未來世界之新文化。彼共產主義過日黃花，舶來劣貨，何足道哉？</p>
<p>改造經濟制度</p>
<p>吾人雖不主張極端唯物史觀，但經濟制度，生活狀况，足以支配個人，影響社會，乃常然之事。故經濟不改良，生活不安定，空言反共，毫無是處。夫共產主義之理想世界，本與中國禮運所謂大　相近。必須根本改造現在經濟制度，務使土地資本收歸公有，生產事業改為公營，全盤統制，平均配給，期於敎育普及，工作營及，人人有職業，人人能生存，人人得享受，人人皆資本家，亦人人皆勞動家。階級之界限不立，鬥爭之狀態不起，共產主義之利皆巳做到，共產主義之害無從發生，此治本之上策也。至於治標，亦可採用戰時計劃經濟。生產集中，分配集中。購買合作，消費合作，沒收囤積糶糶米糧，抑通貨之膨脹，定物資為本位，廢除一切雜稅，獎勵貿易交通，深信一省之內，一年之間，試辦施行，成效可覩。但全和平區域，人得安居樂業，男耕女織，豐食足衣，一般生活，較新四軍八路軍統治下為優閒，雖有共產黨，無所施其技矣。</p>
<p>革新行政機構</p>
<p>苛政猛於虎也。為淵　魚者　也，為　　　者鸇也，為共產黨驅民者，省市縣區之行政官吏也。行政機構不改良，經濟製度亦無從改良。今日之事，苦於官太多，　太分，俸太薄，法太輕，流品太雜，任用太濫，職責不專，賞罰不行。居常竊　，現有機關，可裁其三分之二，每機關公務員，又可裁其三分之二，宜以考試法淘汰之。其留用者，按現時物價，薪俸至少加一百倍，或平均配給所有生活必需品，更加給現金為零用費。務使委任者，最低能養三人，荐任者，最低能養五人，簡任以上者最低能養八人，各依其地位，為生活標準。如再有貪臟枉法者，不妨依特別法庭律，處以死刑，庶幾眞能殺一以儆百矣。洽亂國用重典，雖不重，期必行。今省行政已簡素化，縣區行政及中央行政亦必須商素化。假定設一實騐區，為模範試騐塲，比較之下，殿最立見。孟子曰：飢者易為食，渴者易為飮，民之歸仁，　水之就下，共產黨其奈之何？</p>
<p>實行農本敎育</p>
<p>中國敎育向無一定方針。二十年前，作者已有亡國敎育之感言。事　以後，和平區域各學校，水準尤低，士習尤壞，設不幸為野心者所利用，其流弊更不可勝言。此斷非補苴罅漏。醫頭醫脚，所能挽回補救者也。必須確定農本主義為敎育方針。第一，中國向來以農立國，農民居百分之八十以上。第二，中國工商業尙未發達，惟農業最易普及，且各省荒地甚多，開源並不費事。第三，中國近年農業退化，生產不敷，亟須增進，以求自給。第四，商之本。第五，大東亞共榮圈各國，須分負所能任之責，日本宜於重工業，而中國則現階段下祇宜於農業及輕工業。第六，戰時食糧昻貴，農業可獲厚利。第七，農業為到民間去之運動，以此為敎育方針，能使學生離開都市，轉入鄕村。第八，農業為樸實耐勞之工作，以此為敎育方針，能使學生趨向動儉。革去浮華。且共產黨專門煽動農工階級，倘定農本主義為敎育方針，則智識階級與勞動階級接近調和，而一切鬥爭，自無形消弭矣。</p>
<p>統一軍事指揮</p>
<p>反共者決不可徒恃軍事，但有時亦不得不用軍事。中國歷年軍事反共之失敗，正因前列五項均未設施，猶之抱薪以救火，揚湯以止沸，反共者乃轉以資共也。假使前五項同時並舉，反共已如釜底抽薪，有必要時，再以軍事臨之，自然事半而功倍矣。但軍事亦正未易言，現有普遍雜牌各軍，殆不足以語此。且平時則厲民肥己，為共產黨造機會，戰時則棄甲曳兵，為共產黨供槍枝，共乃愈剿而愈多矣。最好試行徵兵，考取曾受敎育之靑少年，嚴格訊練，全副武裝，編成模範師團，時常實地演習。或精選各師優秀土兵，特殊訓練，重新編制，以一大員統率之，專為對共產黨作戰之用，號令統一，指揮統一。此統兵之大員，在劃定區域內，最好兼攬行政經濟敎育之全權，庶收使指之效，而免製肘之虞。俟該區城，共禍肅淸，除保安外，不妨他調，仍令進剿，期絕根荄，所謂除惡務蓋也。</p>
<p>事棘矣！寇深矣！八路軍已瀰漫華北，新四軍已徧佈江淮，京滬一帶，均受威脅，及此不圖，悔且無及。國府還都，本以反共為口號，軸心同盟，又以反共為目標，大東亞戰爭，中國旣不能出師遠征，駢肩作戰，於此後防重地，首都近郊，若不急起直追，立定澈底反共全面反共之大計，何以對盟邦？何以對國人？願我國人，越我盟邦，早早反省，速速警醒，共同遂行此劃時代之使命！（節錄）</p>

<p>自本報讀者助學金第七屆學生申請辦法公佈之後，承各界關心人士，表示種種意見，辦事處同人深表感謝，有對於新辦法提出疑問者，茲歸納為數點，簡單說明如下：　或以為新辦法對於大各數學生雖屬便利，而少數例外學生將無從申請，失却機會。按此種例外。聞新從外埠到滬，或中途輟學，或原校停閉，究屬極少數。雖如能說關理由，提出證件，辦事處可以直接發給申請　。此種特殊案件，必需俟六月十五日以後，始可受理。　或以為新辦法對於學生過於便利，不需往返奔走，或列隊等待，所以報名人數將多至難於應付。按委員會與辦事處同人亦曾應及此點，惟奔走列隊，究非甄別清寒優秀之合理辦法，所以惟有請各學校當局協助合作，嚴格審查，勿輕予推薦。幷希望每校推薦人數不超過學生人數百分之五。辦事處核發申請書，即以為標準，惟本屆受助學生較多者可酌予通融。是項限制，實非得已，務望各校諒解此意。　或以為新辦法當局對於本校學生之學行家境，必有相當認識，如能乘公遷擾，再由辦事處複選，自較辦事處單獨選擇為周密。至於假公濟私，濫推平庸富有，各數學校當局決不至此，且推薦書需學校負責者二人簽名蓋章，申請者更需經過辦事處複選，學校耳目衆多，如眞正清寒優秀者機會被奪，必有人不平舉發，學校當局名譽攸關，當有所顧慮也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Social Undertakings <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Social undertakings differ from national undertakings. National undertakings are organized by the nation and use national public funds. Social undertakings differ from private undertakings. Private undertakings are managed by private individuals and use private money. The economic source of social undertakings comes purely from private donations in society, so they are not national undertakings. The organization and management of social undertakings are jointly cooperated by people in society, so they are not private undertakings either. Recently, a very strong atmosphere of advocating construction has emerged in Shanghai society. This is a manifestation of human mutual assistance and a beginning of Shanghai people caring about Shanghai local affairs. Since the war, all social undertakings in Shanghai have either been destroyed or stalled. We hope that from now on, we can revive those that have been destroyed, restart those that have been stalled, and, even more, create those that could not have been done in the past. Only in this way can Shanghai people be worthy of Shanghai, and only then can Shanghai be a model for the whole country.</p>
<p>The importance of social undertakings need not be emphasized. However, the main principle of social undertakings lies in permanent continuation. Society is a permanently continuing organism, and social undertakings should also provide continuous service to society. But to enable social undertakings to continue permanently, they need continuous assistance from people in society. To enable people in society to continuously assist, then social undertakings themselves must first demonstrate good results. We dare say that although there are many reasons why social undertakings in Shanghai could not be permanent in the past, most of them were due to poor results, which led to a lack of assistance from society. The reasons why social undertakings are not run well are nothing more than two points: one is organization, and the other is management. We advocate that current social undertakings should have a sound central organization and be managed by experts.</p>
<p>The center of any undertaking is in the highest organization. With a sound organization, strong power can be generated. Social undertakings completely rely on the enthusiasm of the public, so the highest organization is extremely important. The personality and morality of the organizers have always been noticed by the general public. The academic knowledge and talents of the organizers are even more proportional to the progress of the undertaking itself. We believe that the role of the central organization lies in legislation and supervision. Legislation requires knowledge, and supervision requires morality. Within this central organization, at least one or two people should concentrate and cooperate with all parties to study the direction of the social undertaking. Once the direction is set, it should not be changed again, and it should be entrusted to experts for execution and management. The central organization itself should stand in a supervisory position and pay attention at all times.</p>
<p>The specialization of undertakings has become a general principle. The nature of social undertakings is different, including relief, agricultural production, industrial and commercial production, and education. Different types of social undertakings require different experts to preside over them. Presiding over a social undertaking is a matter of business, not a matter of politics. It only requires doing things practically and realistically, without needing to deal with all aspects. In the past, the heads of general social undertakings often forgot their duties, perhaps because their duties were not defined. They often ran around in all directions, which delayed internal work. This is the most unacceptable thing. Social undertakings need expert management, full-time positions, not concurrent positions; they need to concentrate all their energy on doing things, not just superficially going through the motions. The results of the undertaking can guarantee the permanent existence of the undertaking. An undertaking without results cannot exist permanently and cannot obtain permanent support from people in society.</p>
<p>The above two points are the foundation for the progress of social undertakings. We hope that all gentlemen who are enthusiastic about social undertakings will pay attention and give guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Comprehensive War Results for May: A Total of 908 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 7th: The Japanese Army and Navy attacked and intercepted enemy air forces in May, with comprehensive results as follows: Enemy Losses: South Pacific: 228 shot down, 160 destroyed. Central Pacific: 113 shot down, 48 destroyed. Burma: 107 shot down, 90 destroyed or set on fire (including more than 40 gliders). China: 45 shot down (including 8 uncertain), 115 destroyed or set on fire. North Pacific: 1 shot down, 1 destroyed. Total: 908 aircraft. Japanese Losses: 63 self-destroyed or not returned, plus 48 lost on the ground. Total: 111 aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft attacked the enemy air force base on Ziku Island, north coast of New Guinea, on the night of the 6th, setting fire to and destroying its airfield and military facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 4th, Japanese aircraft bombed an enemy fleet attempting to sortie off Biak Island, sinking and destroying one cruiser each, and shooting down three enemy fighters at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Army Launched a General Offensive on the West Bank of the Nu River; Paratroopers Landing at Monyin Have Been Annihilated <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army base on the Nu River front reports that the Chongqing army attacking the Nu River west bank is currently relying solely on air transport to maintain its survival. In order to annihilate them, powerful Japanese units have launched a general offensive. Since the 5th, a part of the Japanese army has been rapidly pursuing the Chongqing 130th Division and is currently advancing towards Yahaosi and the 5186 highland. Another part is holding back Hongmushu and attacking Changpo to put heavy pressure on the Chongqing army. Before the general offensive, the Japanese army first inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army attacking the front of Lengshui Gou on the 3rd. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned 145 corpses, and many people, including a regimental commander, were wounded. Another Japanese unit also annihilated the Chongqing army near Zhangjiao. Therefore, the Chongqing army's plan to report back to northern Myanmar has been shattered. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, and with supply lines cut off, they have fallen into a dilemma.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters reporter, anti-Axis paratroopers, after landing southwest of Mogaung and Monyin on the Myitkyina-Andada railway in northern Burma, were fiercely attacked by the Japanese army and suffered heavy losses. They retreated to the northern forest area. The Reuters reporter explained the battle situation, saying that the paratroopers in that area, commanded by Brigadier General Lymington, consisted of Gurkha and British troops. They were surrounded and attacked by powerful Japanese units and were unable to resist. On the 27th, the Japanese infantry broke in at close quarters and occupied the airfield. As a result, the enemy's supply line was cut off, and they had to withdraw from their positions.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Fukuoka dispatch, Japanese Sergeant Horie of the Army, who had previously been active in the southern theater, returned to Fukuoka Prefecture by plane on the afternoon of the 6th. He talked about his experience of sinking a submarine, saying that he went to the Menado area on a certain day in April to take on the task of escorting a convoy. While searching for enemy troops in that sea area, he suddenly saw an enemy shadow on the white sea surface. Upon closer inspection, it was an enemy American submarine. At that time, our convoy was sailing, and the enemy submarine was planning to carry out a torpedo attack. At this critical moment, he quickly changed direction and launched a fierce attack on the enemy submarine. In an instant, water splashed into the sky, forming two water columns. Two of the bombs hit the target, and the enemy submarine gradually sank to the bottom of the sea. He flew to a height of 500 meters to observe the sea surface and saw heavy oil covering the sea. He then knew that the enemy submarine had indeed been sunk. After completing the mission, he continued to protect the convoy forward.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The field areas affiliated to the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in addition to the Pangshan Lake Experimental Farm jointly operated with the Ministry of Construction, include one cotton test field, one hemp test field, three cotton seed farms, two rice and wheat seed farms, one cultivated land crop seed propagation farm, twelve forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, six seedling nurseries, one sericulture test field, two sericulture improvement experimental areas, and thirty-one agricultural improvement experimental areas.

In view of this year being a year of increased production, the department urgently needs to seek improvement in a timely manner, so it sent Deputy Director Guo Qianzhi, Director of the Agricultural Department Deng Zongwen, and others to inspect the various field areas separately. After the personnel departed and arrived at various places, in addition to providing timely instructions on the promotion of work, they have now returned to the department one after another and prepared reports. The comprehensive understanding of all improvement opinions is as follows: Enrich technical personnel. Expand necessary agricultural machinery and equipment. Apply excellent technology, propagate excellent seeds and seedlings as much as possible, and demonstrate cultivation. Train and guide nearby farmers, universally improve agriculture, and strive to increase production. Investigate the economic situation of rural areas to facilitate financial regulation. Guide the organization of production mutual aid societies, jointly operate, and promote the speed of increased production.</p>
<p>Adjustment of Experimental Areas</p>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the working conditions of the agricultural organs, and promote the implementation of production increase program, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will convene a meeting on the 9th of this month, comprised of all agricultural organs. In the morning of the 9th, all the areas will report on their progress, and in the afternoon they will hold discussions to address the increase in production. Further, after taking control over the Ministry of Food affiliated Agriculture Improvement Experimental Zone, besides the collaboration with Jiangning county, there are a total of (31) areas, and the provinces and cities also have locations where rice and wheat grow well. The organization of the Agricultural Improvement Experimental Zone is repetitive, and the scheme is inconsistent. With limitations to the personnel and the capital, the events are greatly restricted. In order to concentrate on resources, enhance the organizations, and strengthen their functionality, the original Agriculture Improvement Experimental Zones will be consolidated into 10 areas. The other areas that are difficult to reach due to poor transportation, security issues, and provinces that do not have an agricultural improvement zone will be shut down. This measure will come into effect immediately. The ones that will stay are: Yanshi Ji, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangdu, Taixian, Jiaxing, Kangxian, Dangtu, Chuxian, Beiqiao, these ten areas. The ones that will be shut down are: Shangxinhe, Jiangningzhen, Longtan, Liuhe, Xiashu, Wuhu, Mingguang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Taicang, Songjiang, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Fengjing, Haining, Zhenjiang, Pinghu, Danyang, Wujin. Kunshan special seed plantation will also be shut down, and another area will be assigned for this task. For the collaboration zone in Jiangning county, the county will be in charge by itself starting from June, with no financial aid from the government.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Commercial Representative to Vietnam, Zhang Yongfu, returned to the country to report on his work. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang to understand the work of overseas Chinese affairs in Vietnam. Mr. Zhang replied as follows: How is the work of overseas Chinese affairs in various parts of Vietnam? How do overseas Chinese promote cooperation with the motherland and complete the Greater East Asia War together? (Answer) After the fall of Hong Kong, Allied forces entered Vietnam, and overseas Chinese still had strong old views on the Chongqing side. When I first arrived, I had to break this situation. Last year, I was appointed as the Commercial Representative to Vietnam. Overseas Chinese realized that resistance was not a plan, and their understanding of the peace movement deepened. The work of overseas Chinese affairs was able to be actively promoted. After the National Government declared war, support associations for the war were established in Cochinchina, Tonkin, Annam, and Dongpu Village in Vietnam. They contributed a lot to the Greater East Asia War. How is the education of overseas Chinese different from the education in the motherland? (Answer) Wherever overseas Chinese go, there are schools in villages with one or two hundred households. Slightly larger commercial ports have junior high schools and normal schools. In foreign language schools established by foreigners, the number of overseas Chinese who receive education also exceeds the number of foreigners. About eight out of ten people receive education. The education of overseas Chinese is very developed. There are more than 600,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam and more than 600 overseas Chinese schools. Recently, the Allies have also established co-prosperity societies in various cities to run schools and cultural propaganda institutions, which greatly help the education of our overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Rice Prices Gradually Decline</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Area Rice Procurement Industry Association of the Rice Control Association, fearing a food shortage in Hangzhou, urgently needed relief. In accordance with the regulations of the Rice Control Association, it procured 5,000 shi of rice in Xiashi and transported it all to Hangzhou in late April, handing it over to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for distribution by the Food Bureau. According to the stipulated price of 1,150 yuan per shi, distribution began on May 9. A total of 1,400 shi of rice was distributed to civil servants and 3,600 shi to citizens, which has been completed and concluded. Therefore, rice prices in Hangzhou are gradually declining. It is now learned that the Provincial Government and the association are continuing to find ways to procure rice to resist [high prices].</p>
<h3 id="e10">Recent Trade Between Hong Kong and Guangdong <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The economic situation in South China and Hong Kong, centered on Guangzhou, has become increasingly characterized by the integration of economy and politics since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and can also overcome various difficulties caused by the war and develop forward. The current situation in various places is introduced as follows: In Hong Kong, two and a half years after being occupied by the Japanese army, its economic dynamics have become active due to the development of trade and shipbuilding. Hong Kong's port terminals and warehouses have fully exerted their functions, taking on the trade of Central China, Guangdong, Xiamen, Shantou, Hainan Island, and the Philippines, as well as the exchange of materials between Japan, Taiwan, Syonan, Vietnam, Thailand, and other regions in Southeast Asia. Among them, trade with Guangdong is even more prosperous. Transportation, which has always been by sea, has also been completed by land after the full opening of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on December 28 last year. In addition, the trade agreement between Guangdong and Hong Kong for this year, decided on March 25, has stipulated the mutual export amount between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The export amount of Guangdong is 6 million yuan, and the export amount of Hong Kong is 18 million yuan. In addition, coastal trade is carried out using sailing ships. Excellent shipyards in Hong Kong and Yangon continue to put mechanical sailing ships into the water, and recently, large wooden ships of thousands of tons have begun construction. At the same time, in order to cooperate with shipbuilding in various southern regions, the Hong Kong Governor's Office and the Southern Military Administration Department have also stipulated the supply of shipbuilding workers to various places. In addition to shipbuilding, other industries in Hong Kong, such as sugar, tobacco, Manila rope, cement, oxygen, manufacturing, seasonings, beer, soft drinks, dyes, etc., have also made considerable progress. The raw materials are imported from Guangdong, Myanmar, and other places, and then exported to various places after being manufactured. Therefore, Hong Kong can also be called a material supply base. In Guangdong, handicrafts account for the main part of the economy, and its exports mainly include mats, native cloth, bamboo and rattan, and delicate work. There is no production of mechanical industry. At present, the total number of factories in Guangdong is 4,610, of which 4,300 are operated by Chinese and 300 are operated by Japanese. However, due to the progress of the war, the shortage of ships, and changes in the export market, its operations are becoming increasingly unstable. In order to solve this situation, the Guangdong Provincial Government is also working hard to rectify Chinese factories in accordance with the Japanese policy of consolidation, merger, reorganization, and suspension of operations. Since the establishment of the Guangdong Branch of the National Commercial Control Federation on April 8, the Chinese economic community has gradually moved towards a controlled approach. In order to prepare for the implementation of the highest price system for important materials, and to further implement the investigation of the goods in stock in Guangzhou, a Materials Investigation Committee has been established, with the provincial governor serving as the chairman, in order to thoroughly promote the meeting. In addition, in terms of finance, the Japanese Bank has stipulated a savings withdrawal system for emergency periods and abolished the repeated taxation system for the export of materials by the Guangdong Customs, using a one-time system for transit taxes. On Hainan Island, the most noteworthy issues are the rich iron ore deposits, the equipment for transportation on the island, and the increase in food production. These problems have been solved due to the appropriate implementation of policies, and the security of the island is also improving day by day, so they are all worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated on the 6th regarding the Allied landing operation on the north coast of France: We will immediately annihilate the thugs who kill German women. We Germans all have such determination. The result of this operation will shock the proud American and British people. In the end, the British and Americans will know the falsehood of their national propaganda and feel great terror. The enemy chose a distant date to start the war. Today is the day for them to relive the tragedy of Dunkirk four years ago. We are only waiting for the enemy's tragic results. Whether the enemy only intends to feign an attack or truly intends to carry out a large-scale invasion operation will be evaluated based on future developments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: No one can know when the invasion of Europe launched last night will reach its climax, but its favorable outcome for Germany has long been a foregone conclusion. The Germans are satisfied that the British and Americans have finally begun their attempt to invade Europe. The Germans have been waiting for this for a long time, and now, under Stalin's pressure, the invasion has been realized. President Roosevelt also needs the success of the invasion to help his election campaign. The spokesperson pointed out the prelude to the invasion, saying that in the past few months, the nerve war against Germany and all of Europe and the terrorist attacks against Europe were attempts to defeat the morale of Europe, but the enemy failed to soften the Germans. The Germans are even more determined today to settle old scores with the enemy. At present, weapons come first, and diplomats and politicians should remain silent.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the establishment of financial institutions, the reporter previously interviewed the authorities of the Ministry of Finance, who provided detailed information, which was published in various newspapers on June 1. Now, the supervision and inspection of existing financial institutions is related to the financial industry itself and the social economy, so I have visited again. The information I have been told is summarized as follows: The Ministry is responsible for supervising and guiding financial institutions. In order to promote convenience and thoroughness, it has entrusted the Central Reserve Bank to set up an Inspection Office for Financial Affairs, which specializes in inspecting the business of financial institutions. Since its establishment, the office has been diligent in its work and has achieved great results. Recently, fearing that financial institutions in Shanghai may be fueling hoarding, and wanting to understand their assets, liabilities, and business conditions, the Ministry ordered the office to conduct inspections. The office has now reported to the Ministry the inspections that ended from March 3 to April 25 this year. All financial institutions with improper management have been punished separately. Among them, the eight institutions that were fined for evading deposit reserve requirements with false statements are Baosheng Bank, Shende Qianzhuang, Lisheng Trust Company, Guangzhong Bank, China Cloth Industry Commercial Savings Bank, Xinkang Qianzhuang, and Zhengda Qianzhuang. The six institutions that were warned for excessive lending, failure to report deposits, poor business policies, and improper measures are Shende Qianzhuang, Daxia Bank, Minsheng Bank, Lisheng Trust Company, and Zhongmao Bank. The one institution that was suspended from business for unauthorized re-pledging of collateral, acting as a guarantor for customers out of personal interest, and dereliction of duty by the general manager and directors is China Cloth Industry Commercial Savings Bank. The one institution that was suspended from operating the savings and trust departments for investing capital in businesses other than finance is Guangzhong Bank. After these punishments, the financial institutions should be more vigilant in their business operations. If they still knowingly violate the regulations, they should be severely punished once the inspection has evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Landing Point on the West Coast of France; War Expanding; Bridgehead Established Near Caen <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities claim that as of the afternoon of the 6th, anti-Axis forces had only formed a bridgehead of one and a half kilometers near Caen.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Military authorities here revealed this morning that a full-scale fierce battle is underway on the northwest coast of France. Enemy forces between Carentan and Bayeux (the area protruding into the English Channel in northwestern France) have been forced to retreat. Enemy forces that have landed in the Orne River estuary war zone have been blocked, but under strong artillery fire cover, the enemy is receiving reinforcements.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces' European landing operation began on the 6th. It started as early as 9 PM on the 5th, when the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast to France, requesting women and children within 35 kilometers of the coastline to evacuate immediately, followed by about 1,000 bombers carrying out</p>
<p>Concentrated Bombing</p>
<p>on European fortresses facing the Strait of Dover.</p>
<p>The bombing intensified further into the night, and the bombing area expanded from coastal fortresses to assembly points for German reserve forces in the rear. At 1:30 AM, anti-Axis paratroopers landed on the islands of Quessant and Yeu, west of the Normandy Peninsula, launching an attempted landing operation. Soon after, the British 166th Parachute Division landed near Ouistreham, west of the Orne River, and the American 82nd and 101st Parachute and Glider Divisions descended from the sky, launching operations to secure landing points.</p>
<p>Focus of Operations</p>
<p>After Barfleur, Caen, Courseulles, and Trouville, more paratroopers were dropped within five kilometers of the coast near these locations, launching operations to cover the landing of the seaborne army. At that time, ships and more than 4,000 landing craft from Britain, the United States, and France had already sailed from the sea near Calais to Île de Sein to gather, waiting for action in the English Channel. At 5:30 AM on the 7th, as the sky began to brighten, they began to advance towards the areas where the paratroopers had landed. At the same time, most of the small vessels began to shell the coastline, with six battleships and twenty destroyers</p>
<p>Providing Strong Naval</p>
<p>coverage for the shelling of the left and right flanks of Trouville and Barfleur, attempting to prevent the German-vaunted Atlantic Wall from displaying its prowess. Amidst the rumbling of artillery fire, countless landing craft of various sizes were released from the scattered 3,000-ton-class transport ships on the sea, breaking through the smoke screen and rushing to the shore. Especially at the mouths of the Orne and Vire rivers, flat-bottomed transport boats surged upstream, executing a daring tactic of landing behind the German fortress area. Against this kind of frontal attack, German minelayers were the first to sortie, disregarding the disparity in numbers and the intensity of the artillery fire, bravely plunging into the enemy fleet, using mines and</p>
<p>Intense Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Coastal artillery also concentrated its fire, striving to defend, but due to the more intense anti-Axis bombing until dawn, forty anti-Axis landing craft managed to approach and land successfully, and thirty-five heavy-laden vehicles drove onto the beach. At that time, German rear reserve forces had already been bombed by anti-Axis aircraft and began to assemble. An anti-Axis parachute regiment entered a German minefield, and its entire army was immediately shattered. By noon, the anti-Axis paratroopers in the Barfleur and Seine/Orne River areas had been completely annihilated by the German army. German motorized units launched a concentrated attack on the main British force of about seven or eight divisions landing from the sea, largely</p>
<p>Routing Them</p>
<p>and forcing them to retreat to where they came from. As of 7:00 PM on the 6th, only in an area one and a half kilometers deep and five to ten kilometers wide on the banks of the Orne River, a unit of anti-Axis forces was putting up a strong resistance, staging a one-man show of landing operations. German authorities stated that this could not be called a bridgehead, but merely a landing point, from which it can be seen that the anti-Axis landing operation has not achieved the expected results. It is even more evident that the anti-Axis forces will continue to launch a major offensive after the night of the 6th, according to a large-scale overall landing plan. The anti-Axis forces apparently intend to first seize the ports of Le Havre and Cherbourg, which can directly accommodate large ships, then land in the Saint-Malo area, and launch a decisive battle in northern France in one go. At present, success or failure is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Risky Landing Using Rope Ladders</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: It is learned that the main center of the anti-Axis landing seems to be between Saint-Vaast, west of the Seine estuary, and Ouistreham, ten miles north of Caen. Many landing ships and assault boats have docked here. At the same time, yesterday afternoon, 200 enemy ships sailed to the coast of Arromanches in the Cherbourg Peninsula (21 kilometers west-north of Caen). It is not yet known whether a landing has taken place. The anti-Axis forces are attempting to use rope ladders to climb the steep coast here. Yesterday, British and American tanks and vehicles also landed here. Multiple balloons were seen in the high altitude over the landing areas, seemingly containing artillery observers. British and American fighter planes constantly circled around the balloons.</p>
<p>Six Thousand Ships Cruising the Sea</p>
<p>Paris, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Radio Paris broadcasted today that the anti-Axis armada consists of more than 6,000 ships cruising near Cherbourg, exchanging fire with German shore batteries. This fleet includes battleships and various landing ships.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – A German military spokesman announced today that anti-Axis forces again parachuted a large number of troops into the Seine area on the night of the 6th.</p>
<p>Paratroopers on Channel Islands Annihilated</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 7th that German forces have completely annihilated the anti-Axis paratroopers who landed on the islands of Quessant and Yeu in the English Channel.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to news from here this morning, the American forces who landed south of Cherbourg yesterday have all been annihilated. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army completely eliminated the enemy army, leaving no one alive.</p>
<p>Composition of the Invasion Forces</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 7 (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, London, the afternoon of the 6th: The composition of the anti-Axis invasion forces is as follows: The naval forces participating in the invasion consist of the British and American fleets, the Canadian fleet, and the fleets of the Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, French, and Greek governments in exile. The ratio of the British and American fleets is approximately three to one. The land forces consist of American, British, and Canadian troops, with Montgomery as the commander-in-chief. The air force consists of fighters, light and heavy bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and transport aircraft. The main force under the direct command of Eisenhower is composed of British, American, and Canadian troops.</p>
<p>British and American Strategic Diversionary Tactics</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced when meeting with a group of international reporters at noon on the 6th that since the anti-Axis forces launched the Western European landing operation, a considerable amount of time has passed, and therefore the situation on that front has gradually become clear. It has been determined that the anti-Axis forces are attempting to launch a so-called sea, land, and air offensive on a 120-kilometer front from the mouth of the Seine River to the mouth of the Vire River. This area is the closest to Paris in the coastal area of the Strait of Dover. However, the German army has long built a well-prepared defensive position there, which, in terms of thickness and armor, is the most solid location among the European fortresses. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces did not adopt the tactic of directly attacking the weak points, but used the most dangerous special tactics. This operation is a kind of diversionary tactic. Therefore, it is also possible that the anti-Axis forces will attempt to land at other locations.</p>

<p>US Troops Cross the Volturno River</p>
<p>Lisbon, July 7 (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Naples: After occupying Rome, the anti-Axis forces immediately crossed the Volturno River and advanced northeast towards the outskirts of Rome, currently engaging in fierce battles with the German army in that area. Furthermore, the anti-Axis forces announced on the 6th that the fighting in and around Rome would bypass Vatican City. Due to the anti-Axis forces' occupation of Rome, their offensive has entered a new phase. The US Fifth Army has now crossed the Volturno River at a new location, advancing to a point about five miles from the river.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Anti-Axis forces commander General Alexander continued his offensive on the 5th, with the focus on the western flank. General Alexander launched an attack west and northwest from Rome, but his tanks and motorized units were engaged in significant battles. On the evening of the 4th, the German army carried out a systematic withdrawal, so that the American army's fierce attack through Rome ultimately came to nothing.</p>
<p>Attitudes of Various Countries</p>
<p>Soviet Silence</p>
<p>Ankara, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Diplomatic circles here have learned that Moscow officials are still maintaining silence regarding the news of the European offensive. Of the three giants of the Tehran Conference, only Stalin has not yet made a statement. Apart from broadcasting the news of the European offensive, Moscow Radio has not made any commentary, and the same is true of Soviet newspapers.</p>

<p>Swedish Calm</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Yesterday was Sweden's National Day, and the people were unwilling to be greatly disturbed by the news of the European offensive. Only the "Aftonbladet" published a brief commentary, saying, "The European offensive has begun, and the war zone will become increasingly close to the Swedish border," and stating, "The anti-Axis forces may also land in areas along the coasts of Norway and Denmark. We must be vigilant at all times in order to avoid being drawn into the war at this final juncture, and prepare for any eventuality."</p>

<p>— Jiang Kanghu</p>
<p>Respect Indigenous Culture</p>
<p>A nation in this world must have a reason for its existence. China is China, and the Chinese people are Chinese because they have their own unique historical, geographical, ethnic, and cultural characteristics. No matter what kind of ideology or policy, it must recognize this natural fact as a prerequisite for all words and actions. China's indigenous culture is the system passed down from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, compiled by Confucius and Mencius, and praised by the various schools of Lao-Zhuang, Yang-Mo, Legalists, etc. It is recorded in the Thirteen Classics and Twenty-Four Histories. All the exemplary words and deeds of past emperors, ministers, teachers, and mentors since the Qin and Han dynasties that have been shown to us belong to this. If we abandon all of this, then the nation will cease to be a nation, and the people will not be their people. Good laws and beautiful intentions will be of no use. Therefore, those who oppose communism must first know to respect our country's existing culture, enhance our self-esteem, and cultivate our self-confidence, ensuring that we have a central idea and that the content is substantial. Then, foreign heresies will have no way to enter. Even if there is incitement, we will not be shaken. We must know: Chinese culture inherently has value, which is unanimously praised by scholars from the East and West. This is one reason. Chinese culture is created by ourselves, and when used properly, it is the most suitable. This is the second reason. Chinese culture was transmitted to Japan, where it was preserved without loss, gradually leading to strength. This is the third reason. Moreover, belief is power. When we have faith in Chinese culture, we can rely on this power to be saved. This is the fourth reason. Chinese culture is not only the central thought of the Chinese people but can also serve as a common guide for the people of East Asia. It can also be harmonized and supplemented with Western culture to create a new culture for the future world. Communism is a stale fad, a shoddy imported product. What is there to discuss?</p>
<p>Transform the Economic System</p>
<p>Although we do not advocate the extreme materialist view of history, economic systems and living conditions are naturally capable of governing individuals and influencing society. Therefore, without economic improvement and stable living conditions, empty talk about opposing communism is of no use. The ideal world of communism is actually similar to the Great Harmony described in the Chinese Book of Rites. It is necessary to fundamentally transform the current economic system, ensuring that land and capital are owned by the public, production is managed by the public, all operations are centrally controlled, and distribution is equalized. The goal is universal education, employment for all, survival for all, enjoyment for all, everyone a capitalist, and everyone a laborer. The boundaries of class will not be established, and the state of struggle will not arise. All the benefits of communism will be achieved, and the harms of communism will have no way to occur. This is the best long-term strategy. As for short-term measures, wartime planned economy can also be adopted. Production is concentrated, distribution is concentrated, purchasing is cooperative, consumption is cooperative, hoarding of rice is confiscated, inflation is suppressed, goods are used as the standard, all miscellaneous taxes are abolished, and trade and transportation are encouraged. I firmly believe that if this is tried and implemented within one province for one year, the results will be visible. When all peaceful areas are places where people can live and work in peace, where men till the fields and women weave, and where there is abundant food and clothing, general life will be more leisurely than under the rule of the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. Even if there are communists, they will have no opportunity to use their skills.</p>
<p>Reform Administrative Agencies</p>
<p>Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger. Those who drive the fish into the deep pool are the otters, those who drive the birds into the thicket are the hawks, and those who drive the people to the communists are the administrative officials of the provinces, cities, counties, and districts. Without reform of the administrative agencies, there is no way to reform the economic system. Today's problem is that there are too many officials, the power is too divided, the salaries are too low, the laws are too lenient, the qualifications are too mixed, appointments are too lax, responsibilities are not specific, and rewards and punishments are not enforced. They usually steal and embezzle. The existing agencies can be reduced by two-thirds, and the civil servants in each agency can also be reduced by two-thirds. They should be eliminated by examination. Those who are retained should have their salaries increased by at least one hundred times according to current prices, or they should be given an equal share of all necessities, plus cash for expenses. The lowest-ranking appointee should be able to support three people, the recommended appointee should be able to support five people, and those above the simplified appointment level should be able to support eight people, each according to their position as a standard of living. If there are still those who are corrupt and pervert the law, they may be sentenced to death by a special court law, so that one can truly be killed as a warning to a hundred. In a chaotic country, heavy penalties should be used, and although they may not be heavy, they must be enforced. Now the provincial administration has been simplified, and the county and district administrations and the central administration must also be simplified. Suppose a demonstration zone is set up as a model demonstration field. By comparison, the best and worst will be immediately apparent. Mencius said: "It is easy to feed the hungry, and easy to give drink to the thirsty. The people's return to benevolence is like water flowing downwards. What can the communists do about it?"</p>
<p>Implement Agrarian-Based Education</p>
<p>Chinese education has never had a definite direction. Twenty years ago, the author already had a sense of education leading to national destruction. After the incident, the standard of schools in the peaceful areas was even lower, and the customs of scholars were even worse. If, unfortunately, they are used by ambitious people, the abuses will be even more unspeakable. These cannot be reversed or remedied by patching up leaks or treating the head when the foot is sick. It is necessary to establish agrarianism as the guiding principle of education. First, China has always been an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for more than 80 percent of the population. Second, China's industry and commerce are not yet developed, but agriculture is the easiest to popularize, and there is a lot of wasteland in various provinces, so opening up resources is not difficult. Third, Chinese agriculture has declined in recent years, and production is insufficient, so it is urgent to increase it in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Fourth, commerce is the root. Fifth, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must share the responsibilities they can bear. Japan should focus on heavy industry, while China should focus on agriculture and light industry at the current stage. Sixth, food is expensive during wartime, and agriculture can make a good profit. Seventh, agriculture is a movement to go to the people. Using this as the guiding principle of education can enable students to leave the city and move to the countryside. Eighth, agriculture is a simple and hardworking job. Using this as the guiding principle of education can enable students to tend towards diligence and thrift and to reject superficiality. Moreover, the communists specialize in inciting the peasant and worker classes. If agrarianism is established as the guiding principle of education, then the intellectual class and the working class will approach and harmonize, and all struggles will naturally disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>Unify Military Command</p>
<p>Those who oppose communism must never rely solely on military force, but sometimes military force must be used. The failure of Chinese military anti-communism over the years is precisely because the five items listed above have not been implemented. It is like using firewood to put out a fire or using boiling water to stop the boiling. Those who oppose communism are instead helping communism. If the five items listed above are carried out simultaneously, anti-communism will be like removing the firewood from under the pot. When necessary, military force can be used again, and the results will naturally be twice as effective with half the effort. However, military affairs are not easy to discuss. The current widespread miscellaneous armies are probably not enough to discuss this. In peacetime, they oppress the people and enrich themselves, creating opportunities for the communists. In wartime, they abandon their armor and drag their weapons, providing the communists with guns. As a result, the more they are suppressed, the more they grow. It is best to try conscription, selecting educated young people, rigorously training them, fully arming them, and forming model divisions, constantly conducting field exercises. Or carefully select excellent soldiers from each division, give them special training, and reorganize them, led by a senior officer, specifically for the purpose of fighting the communists, with unified orders and unified command. The senior officer in command of these troops should, within the designated area, preferably also have full authority over administration, economy, and education, so as to achieve effective command and avoid being constrained. After the communist disaster has been eradicated in the area, he may be transferred elsewhere except for security, and continue to advance and suppress the rebellion, in order to eradicate the root. This is what is meant by eliminating evil completely.</p>
<p>The situation is urgent! The enemy is deep! The Eighth Route Army has spread throughout North China, and the New Fourth Army has spread throughout the Jianghuai area. The Shanghai area is under threat. If we do not act now, it will be too late for regret. The return of the national government to the capital was originally under the slogan of anti-communism. The Axis alliance also has anti-communism as its goal. In the Greater East Asia War, China cannot send troops far away to fight side by side. In this important rear area, near the capital, if we do not rise up quickly and take the great plan of thorough anti-communism and comprehensive anti-communism, how can we face our allies? How can we face our people? May my countrymen, and may our allies, reflect early, wake up quickly, and jointly carry out this epoch-making mission! (Excerpt)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Sixth Air Defense Day Tomorrow; Training to be Held in Different Areas; Air Raid Blackout Training at Night <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice stating: It has been decided that June 9 will be the sixth Air Defense Day. This city will conduct blackout training according to the following procedures, but without sounding sirens. Air raid blackout training from 9 PM to 10 PM, and alert blackout training from 10 PM to 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (the 9th) is the sixth Air Defense Day in this city. In order to raise public awareness of the significance of air defense and to enlighten the public about air defense knowledge, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in addition to still hanging cloth banners with eye-catching slogans at various transportation hubs, will also continue to conduct various air defense training exercises in different areas, such as firefighting, bomb disposal, rescue, and evacuation. Special protection groups of factories and large buildings will also be guided by personnel dispatched by the air defense authorities in various necessary measures of training, in order to achieve proficiency and cope with the occurrence of any unexpected events. According to the two-day civil air defense exercises held at the end of last month, the various measures were not yet satisfactory, and the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Department issued criticism. During the exercises held on that day, air defense personnel should also correct and improve. Furthermore, during the exercises in various districts, passersby stood by and watched, even clapping and shouting, or making no criticisms, which is not in line with the principles of civil air defense. In the future, citizens should automatically participate in the exercises and cooperate to complete the true meaning of civil air defense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Zhabei Sub-bureau has very strict regulations on blackout control. It has now been stipulated that the heads of each Baojia are responsible for patrolling the Baojia under their jurisdiction at any time. Regardless of whether it is a residential household or a store, if there is light leaking out, they should immediately warn and correct it. If they still ignore it, they should report to the sub-bureau for punishment by suspending the electricity supply. At the same time, other sub-bureaus also have the above strict measures. Therefore, residents should pay attention to light leaks, especially from dormer windows and skylights, which should be covered with black cloth curtains to prevent light from leaking out, leading to punishment.</p>

Although retail rice vendors have disappeared, wholesale rice from the suburbs is flowing in steadily. It is expected that the price of rice will decline further within days. Rice merchants in Nanshi, Pudong, West Shanghai, and Zhabei are now actively preparing to form rice purchasing groups according to the instructions of the authorities, in order to purchase large quantities of rice from various inland areas and transport it to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Fire Department Requests Assistance in Preventing Theft of Public Fire Hydrants</p>
<p>Matters Concerning the Safety of Citizens' Lives and Property</p>
<p>The Fire Department of the First Police Bureau of this city, in order to prevent the theft of public fire hydrant parts on the streets, yesterday issued a statement saying: "Public fire hydrants on the streets are known to all as the most important and indispensable source of water for firefighting. Therefore, no matter how well-equipped a fire department is, it cannot fully exert its function without fire hydrants in the event of a fire. Fire hydrants are the weapons for protecting the lives and property of citizens during a fire. Recently, unscrupulous elements have been destroying fire hydrants or stealing their parts, which is not uncommon, causing fire hydrants to be in a state of disrepair. The authorities are making every effort to prevent this, but the area is vast, and the fire hydrants are scattered throughout. Preventing theft is very difficult, and it is particularly worrying in terms of the defense of the lives and property of Shanghai citizens. All residents of this city, if they witness such theft crimes, must not take a bystander attitude. For their own interests, they should immediately report to the police, or assist the villagers in arresting the criminals and sending them to the military police, or take other appropriate measures to cooperate in eliminating the public enemy that threatens the lives and property of citizens."</p>

<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3 id="e32">Explanation of Application Method <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund's seventh student application method, we are grateful to people from all walks of life for expressing various opinions. The colleagues in the office are deeply grateful. For those who have questions about the new method, the following is a summary of several points for simple explanation: Some people think that although the new method is convenient for most students, a few exceptional students will have no way to apply and will lose the opportunity. According to this kind of exception. Hearing about new students from other places to Shanghai, or students who dropped out of school midway, or students whose original schools were closed, are very few. Even if they can explain the reasons and provide evidence, the office can directly issue the application form. These special cases must be accepted only after June 15. Some people think that the new method is too convenient for students, without the need to go back and forth, or wait in line, so the number of applicants will be so large that it will be difficult to cope with. The committee and the colleagues in the office have also responded to this point, but running around and waiting in line are not reasonable methods for identifying poor and excellent students. Therefore, we can only ask the school authorities to assist and cooperate, strictly review the applications, and do not recommend them lightly. And we hope that the number of recommendations per school does not exceed 5% of the number of students. The office will issue the application form as a standard, but schools with more recipients in this session can be accommodated appropriately. This restriction is really unavoidable, and we hope that the schools will understand this intention. Some people think that the school authorities must have a considerable understanding of the students' academic performance, family background, etc. If they can take advantage of the opportunity to disturb the process and have the office re-select, it will be more thorough than the office's independent selection. As for taking advantage of public office for personal gain and recommending mediocre and wealthy students, most school authorities will not do this. Moreover, the recommendation letter requires the signature and seal of two responsible persons from the school, and the applicant needs to be re-selected by the office. There are many eyes and ears in the school, if the opportunity for a truly poor and excellent student is taken away, someone will definitely be unhappy and report it. The reputation of the school authorities is at stake, so they should have some concerns.</p>
