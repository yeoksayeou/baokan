<h3 id="c1">教育下一代 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>社會國家民族是一個綿延不斷的有機體，這個有機體需要各個人從各方面永久的努力維持，方才能够永久存在。看大家努力程度的大小，努力時間的久暫，就可以斷定這個有機　能够存在多麽大，多麽久。因此，每個人都受到上一代的扶養敎育的權利，每個人就都有扶養下一代的義務。</p>
<p>在中國，敎育下一代的工作更比其他各國重要。中國是一個閉關自守的國家，自從海通以還，各方面在在落忍之後，因爲追不上任家，所以着着失敗。這個中國在近百年以來，幾乎僅僅能夠維持一綫生機，而環境的壓迫每使他喘不過氣。要再大時代裏面做以各人，做一個國家，就非得加倍的迎頭趕上去不可。我們現在要努力，將來更要努力，敎育下一代的工作，就在使子子孫蓀能够存在而努力，惟有這樣繼續不斷的努力，方能使中國日趨強盛，中華民族發揚光內</p>
<p>在目前的中國，敎育下一代的工作更　其他各國迫切·在英美侵略之下百餘年，由國幾乎被壓迫得翻不轉身，幸而這次大東亞中國的一切都要中國自己決定，所謂「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」，種植的責任都在現在中國人的身上。看我們怎樣教育下一代，就克以想像出將來中國的前途·我們希望將來的中國成功一個獨立的國家，我們先得敎育我們的子弟成功一個獨立的人·這是一個好機會，但是，假如不能够利用，就等於沒有機會。</p>
<p>敎育下一代是百年樹人的工作，是一個艱鉅的工作。而其中最最要緊的，簡單的說來，就在給下一代有受敎育的機會。若不先使下一代的同胞有讀書的機會，下一代中國的前途問題根本就談不到。這固然是國家政府應負的責任，同時，這是整個中國民族問題，所以整個社會應當竭力幫助這件工作。我們在言論界立傷，數年來更集中於助學事業的提倡，唯一的目的，就在於此。</p>
<p>現在第七屆助學運動又開始了，社會經濟情況衰落如此，下學期的失學靑年不知又要增加多少。大家想想，假如不設法補救，下一代盡是無知無職的同胞，中國的前途有希望嗎？我們是不是願意做個僅僅一代的自了漢我們是不是願意我們的民族走上滅亡的途徑，如果不然，我們就要起來，我們大家要幫助這個敎育下一代同胞的工作。最近本報舉辦足球籃球比賽，全上海同胞都是我們的贊助人，熱烈的情緒使辦事人增加不少勇氣，社會的同情最可貴，社會的意識最明自，最淸楚，助學運動不過是敎育下一代工作的起點，我們希望大家幫助這個起點工作</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍施行夜襲戰　巴列爾敵後退中　比先波爾南展開壯烈空戰 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　巴列爾方面敵二十師主力，前會不斷拼死反攻，後經日軍壓迫，即大呈動搖，現巳着着退却。緣敵軍於退却前，日軍精銳部隊曾冒一切艱難，對敵反覆施行肉搏及夜襲戰，使敵第一錢八十旅　因壓迫不支分別潰退。又敵軍企圖由丹克諾巴爾三义路附近直撲日軍側背，首於七日午夜悄然退却，本道正而及北方之敵軍，亦遂次開始潰走，並不斷向巴列爾方面撤退。當時日軍各部隊以機不可逸，突然發動猛攻，蕩丹尼諾巴爾北方三叉路附近及東側之頑敵，其他部隊亦與之呼應，而在西頓吉　及法爾布恩擴張戰果，更由本道正面加以猛攻，雙方砲聲股殷，震壓戰傷一帶。</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　緬甸日戰門樣隊，於八日上午，轟炸伊姆法爾時，在比先波爾南方十五公里上空，與敵哈里肯式戰鬥機四架遵遇，當展開壯烈空戰，日機瞬將其全部擊落（其中一架未濟實）。此外，日機更邀　在伊姆法爾南方機場上空哨戒之敵P51型機一架，立將其擊落，日機於完成任務後，即安然飛返。</p>
<p>北緬方面戰況</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　據渝「中央社」前綫特派員報稱，密芝那方面戰况不能順利進展，謂美將校所率之特殊部隊，為協力密芝那方面作戰，部隊曾向伊洛瓦底河東岸推進，但日軍自七日夜以來，即對該地西方之渝軍加以猛烈攻擊。又美空軍亦因氣候不佳，不能展開大規模之活動，僅於緬甸北部活動而巳。</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　渝軍第一一六·一三〇·三六〇三師主力，為打通新援渝路綫，而進至怒江四岸後，因逍日軍絕妙邀擊，已被擊潰。如月之六日，緬甸方面曾有渝軍數百來襲，日軍當即向之猛擊，使其潰滅，僅渝軍所棄屍體，確認已達二百九十餘具。又是日來侵拉孟周園地區之渝軍數百，亦於日軍猛烈射學下，僅殘存百八十四人而潰退。同時，降落於北緬密芝那周圍之渝傘兵，由於日軍後方部隊之增援，且漸次壓縮其包圍陣，故渝軍損失甚重。被俘渝軍新編第某師師長，曾向後方要求「因損失過重，尤以幹部為甚，故請迅速派來將校五十名」云云，跋俘處又謂，該方　渝軍幹部之損失，計陣亡大隊長三，負傷之大隊長二，中隊長二，故該方面渝軍似巳蒙甚大打擊·</p>
<p>印兵反英厭戰</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　據最近敵方消息稱：英軍最高司令部，最近對英印軍及印度兵之家屬以及朋友等所寄與之各極信件，一律實施嚴重檢查。並發令嚴禁印度兵與一般印人會面·蓋此等措置，實因甘地翁設釋後　深恐甘地翁之達成印完全獨立，與要求英國撤出印度之思想彤響及印度兵，故英軍最高司令部極感憂慮，且受不同待遇之印度兵，厭戰與反英氣勢，日益昂揚，故英軍當局最近極力增强對印度吳之特別監察部隊，督勵各部隊作戰，並探察印度兵之反對言東，此駐屯於國內之印度兵，其士氣已均　喪。前於阿蘇密州曾有印度兵部隊，英特別監察部隊發生　突之事件，且於數日前駐屯　案之馬德拉施之印度兵部隊，與英軍之間復生衝突事件。同時，更有公然脫逃與反抗上級等行動，陷於　況中之英印軍最高司令，狼　無策，　近據傅　，擬改編前綫部隊之編制，配組英印混合部隊，以期督戰。</p>
<h3 id="c3">盟邦各界　關切主席政躬　殷切懇摯使人感激 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京十二中央社電　褚部長返京談話，巳見於日前各報。記者頃晤褚部長於紀念週會席上，據云，盟邦各界對於主席政躬關切之股，在在令人感奮。此次在東京歷接盟邦上下各界，對於主席病狀，幾於無人不以此為問，而意之股勤懇擊，使人深為感激。並謂曾宴請阿部大將，更接受阿部大將之招請，數度晤談，關切尤甚。大將於常其出巡各地時，各地人士晤而之時，成殷殷以主席政躬為問，足見盟邦各界關心主席政躬之意，並非僅於國人之前為友誼之表示巳也。蓋彼邦知識份子·多對於中日兩國關係之重要，知之旣深，對於主席偉大人格敬之尤篤，其眞情摯意，逐流露於不覺之中，茲可感矣。褚部長又言，在東京時曾吿盟邦諸友，謂自主席出國就醫以來，吾國中樞各院部及各省各機關，均能守定本位，努力向前，與主席在國內時並無二致，盟邦諸友聞之，均表示深切之安慰也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">國府軍宣團　發表聲明「吿渝將士」 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　國府軍事宣傳團，自三月來緬展開活動以來，予各方面莫大反響，十一日該團會發表聲明，題爲「吿渝軍將士」，指摘渝方抗戰目的之矛盾與指導層之缺乏日覺，勸說渝方爲冀求獨立解放，應速放棄抗戰。繼更宣布英·美籍援助渝方之美名，達到其中國殖民地化之野心，且謂，此次河南作戰，亦在使渝方反省。而呼籲渝万急速覺悟。</p>
<h3 id="c5">滿特別刑法　七月起實施 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>新京十二日中央社電　滿洲當局頃制定「時局特別刑法」，並定於七月一日起實施，要點如次：　對阻害施行國策之官吏公務員，或特殊團體職員之凟職及對其他國家少重要作用上有所侵佔，對妨礙增强戰力，或對重要生產之施行上及戰時國家經濟之運督上之侵害行為並加强其罰則。　對危唆民薪，或侵害其身體財產之行為，加強罰則。</p>
<h3 id="c6">長沙東北　激戰進行中　宣昌展開新戰門 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十二中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十一日發表，　湖南戰綫長沙東北外園防禦綫之戰門，益趨激烈，日軍為攻整省境西北方之外國防　綫，特調遣有力部隊，進攻洞庭湖南方，該地區刻正展開激戰中，又劉陽西北之日軍，十日已進至距離畏沙約十八公里之地點。　河南作戰日軍，於十日上午曾攻擊靈賓，該市現巳陷混亂狀能，又靈賓東南各地域，於十日以來，亦在激戰中。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據美聯社重慶電，日軍與渝軍間，己於長江地區日軍第一綫基地宜昌周圍，開始新戰鬥云。</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　日軍在湖南急速進政，渝軍第九戰區之長沙已臨陷落危機，合衆社電慶十日電，亦承認長沙防衛瀕於絕望狀態。該電稱，因前三次之長沙攻防戰，長沙巿民已撤退凈盡，全城巳完全佈成陣地，渝軍自奉蔣介石死守命令後。已貯藏大量食糧及彈藥。準備激戰，湘江　舨帆船已完全向南移去，尤其長沙城內機關炮林離，街頭到處堆有沙袋，長沙四周各山　，亦到處構鞏要塞，但長沙防衛軍在日軍進攻前，已入絕望狀態。</p>
<p>隴路日軍抵達靈賽</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　重慶當局自洛陽陷落后，對河南戰綫日軍之動向，甚為注目。茲據重慶電，日軍再沿隴海綫西進，刻已抵達靈實，按靈實去潼關僅十六四公里，故重慶當局，必感受莫大威脅。</p>
<p>宗敎團體對日協力</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日軍戡定河南省後，未滿一月，過去呻吟於渝軍高壓下之河南省各種宗敎團體，竟對駐於各地之日軍部隊，自動聲請參加建設樂土之工作，而表對日協力之誠意。頃為謀變方交換意見，與促進彼此理解起見，決於近期作召集各派代表者舉行宗教會議。各軍進駐後，由於實踐以「免進免供出勞力」為原則之新施策後，一時誤信渝軍對日虛偽宣傳之民衆，均為之大受感動，而對日軍信賴之心，逐日昂揚，於茲遂有民衆思想中核之各種宗敎團體，首先出而請求協刀日軍云·</p>

<p>南京十二日中央社電內政部於十二日三時，在該部大禮堂循例會見記者，由袁次長出主持，到各通訊社報社首都中外記者十餘人，由袁次長報告，計分禁烟與民政警政三項，至五時始畢。茲誌大意如次。開關於禁烟問題，第一點，禁烟法規根據國民政府禁烟大綱之規定，除禁期分三年禁絕外，對於毒品絕對禁止，採取立即澈底禁絕之方針，對於禁毒之法律，亦　取嚴厲之規定，不能依畫通刑法治罪，特頒布　毒治罪去，業已施行。第二點說明禁烟查緝之問題，木年五月十三日，呈準行政院設立一獨立機關烟毒查緝處，先在江浦·鎭江·無錫·揚州。四地區設立分處，展開查緝工作。在未設立分處之地域，由行政院通令各地警務機關負責工作。查緝處專管烟毒私運，私販·走私，查緝事務·其餘　民登記，及特許販賣者及登記官十之管理配給，概由禁烟局負責之。　民政，現正研討地方行政機稱之強化問題，即改革現今之行政毒察事員制，根據行政簡素化，縣行政改革問題，其詳細辦法，於下次行政院會議中堂可決定。此次改革縣行政之最大目的，即强化縣行政，尤以縣財政爲主要·推進保甲目前正積極推進中。　　政，自本年一月普遍撤銷車站城關碼頭，旅行人士莫不稱便。惟本部接有各方報告，頗多警察揚奉陰　，在車站等處有種種留難行為，故本部特通令各警察機關主義，　再使各車站等出警察，有達法行為，俾減少行旅通苦。</p>

<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：西歐方面雙方均已調到大批增援軍，尤其在美軍登陸岸頭區內，自維爾河口東面西格尼附近起，沿柯坦汀半島（一名瑟堡半島）東岸向北直至奎尼維爾（Ouineville）一帶。敵大批生力軍分遣隊實行登陸，此等增援軍均隨帶大批重兵器，該登陸岸頭之北部在蒙特堡與奎尼維爾之間，十一日午前情形比較平靜，同時該區之美軍團司令展開較大之編隊，由坦克車為掩護，以便向卡倫坦發動進攻，但該區德軍仍堅守陣地。美軍編隊由茜格尼向西南實施強大之壓力，亦未能有所成功。反軸心軍之用意，在於竄入全部半島直至西岸，然後封鎖其北部，以禦來自南方之進攻，以便在該處實行掃蕩戰，而使該半島成為侵犯戰第二階段之主要基地。蒙高茂萊將軍於十日晚及十一日在侵犯區連同新登陸之分遣隊，共同動軍大約二十師團，其中七至八師團被認為受傷者。</p>

<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德國新聞社引德官方戰報稱：敵軍由克恩及巴猶向南拓展之一切企圖悉被粉碎，其向維爾河口以北之瑟堡前進之企圖亦歸失敗，德軍僅於激戰後退出卡倫坦（Carentan）瑟堡之東伐斯特（Stvaast）沿岸之兩勞德砲隊仍責續與敵艦隊以重砲互轟　　德後備兵待命出動　　柏林十二日中央社電　海通社軍事主任訪員塞托留斯稱，德軍總司令派往諾曼第半島作戰之軍隊，固僅後備隊之一小部份而已。其餘後備軍均在待命出動至總。德軍是否已在柯坦　半島及卡爾伐陀海岸從事大反攻，一時尙難斷言，蓋德軍當局認敵軍對諾曼第之登陸，僅侵歐之第一步，在歐洲其他各處固隨時有其他敵軍以同樣堅强兵力登陸之可能也。惟在諾曼第戰局趨於穩定以前，英美當不致即行發動其他登陸戰。英美總司令部在英本土備有足在他處發動登陸之兵力，然其空軍之全部及海軍之大部份，當已參加此次諾曼第之戰役。以言敵空軍部隊</p>
<p>在此次登陸戰中已大受損失，故在他處登陸時，敵雖尙有普通陸軍可充空運軍，惟就技術上言其戰門效果究不如具有數年特殊訓練之空運軍士兵也：</p>

<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>英美聯軍開始侵歐戰以來，「蘇聯態度如何？」的問題，為全世界所關心。聯軍以為蘇聯茍能呼應他們的登陸戰，而出全力取大攻勢，自然再好沒有。聯軍自從踏上諾曼第的一角以來，業巳一週，登陸雖暫吿成功，但羅斯福·邱吉爾都曾宣稱，此後的戰鬥，實極困難。當然，大家都知道，像這樣偉大的戰事，無論他們怎樣會佔便宜，總不能吹着口笛長驅直入柏林罷！可是他們是徹底的功利主義者，在任何場合，他們打着算盤：「以最小的犧牲獲最大的效果。」因而戰事愈困難，愈想把自己所受的犧牲轉嫁他入，這在他們卑賤的商人根性上是當然的。登陸戰開始後，如果紅軍在耶希地區取反攻態勢，他們將大為高興：「啊！紅軍的大攻勢開始了。」然而蘇聯情報局的公布，則用極冷淡的文句：「前綫無重大變化·」英美的評論家啊！請你們靜下來·打開兵　辭典，尋找「反擊」（Counterattack）「反攻」（Counteroffensive，「攻勢（orjensive）等術　罷！</p>
<p>離開登陸戰戰塲數千哩的重慶，其評論也喧呌着，呼應英美侵歐的蘇聯總反攻，快將開始了。這猶如小犬對冷眼看虎與狼　架的大熊喧呌，煽動大熊也參加這一塲吵架。然而一向不以之為對手的熊的熊度，不動聲色。十日的大公報說：</p>
<p>「據柏林報到，對付從西方來的危險，還不過出動了德軍駐屯於此的極少數。然而史本林似乎在等待東部戰綫的若干德軍向西移動」</p>
<p>那麽，我們試對「蘇聯態度怎樣？」的問題，來作最正確的解答。那誠然是極簡單的。「蘇聯將在自己的立場上，決定是否轉取大攻勢。如果轉取大攻勢，自將選譯認為適當的時間與塲所。」</p>
<p>元來英美的侵歐戰·似乎取着囚蘇聯的對德第二戰綫之要求而實行的形式，但是不然。蘇聯在對德抗戰的最困難時代，把英國的允諾當作　，以之為挽救蘇聯困難的手段而要求開關第二戰綫。然而，在這時代，英美食言而不履行，蘇聯付出了很大的犧牲後，始漸轉攻勢，同時，蘇聯對歐洲的政治壓力，漸見强化。於是英美方才發動登陸戰。表面上似乎在打倒「希特勒·德國」的共同戰爭目的下，開始全面的協助蘇聯。但英美並不是「為了蘇聯」，乃是「為了自已」而殺奔歐洲大陸。他們在北法設定的岸頭堡（Beackhead」，是為了德國的攻擊，同時，也是對付蘇聯的政治，軍事的岸頭堡。蘇聯很明白英美的此種企圖。所以紅軍的機關報「紅星」上說；</p>
<p>「在諾曼第的軍事行動，可說祗盡着次要的任務。聯合軍的主要的攻擊方向，不久即可明瞭。」</p>
<p>在諾曼第登陸的聯合軍，雖有相當的兵力，但以為能對德國與以決定的打擊，尙言之過早。換言之，蘇聯所定義的第而戰綫，尙未開始。聯合軍今後在北法愈舌戰，則英美對紅軍從東方開始大攻勢的要求也愈强。為了答覆蘇聯而展開「侵歐戰爭」的英美，此次反過來對蘇聯要求開關對德「第一戰綫」了。</p>
<p>蘇聯先前所經過的焦燥與不信，此次英　也將飽當此種况味了。</p>
<p>十一日夜，蘇聯懂報局發表，在加勒利亞地區開始攻勢。不待說，此與英美所要求的往東部而來的大攻勢之間，還有很遠的距離。但那裏面也有　　展開對芬政治攻勢的用意。我們必須注意這一；即蘇辦從自身的立塲，在所希望的時間與塲所，展開攻勢。</p>

<p>深信德軍必予英美軍打擊</p>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，於昨（十二）日下午二時，在招待本市中國新聞記者　報道常會席上，特就此次　英美軍　攻歐洲，發表談話如此：</p>
<p>必予英美重大打擊</p>
<p>松平部長首請，敵英美軍自侵攻歐洲，至今時逾五日，　區情形，有似急轉狀態中，敵方降落傘兵已遭受德軍之强力掃落，沿海侵攻之敵海軍，雖在海洋設有概頭堡，至今已死傷四分之一，餘　　　極小地區，破德軍重要包圍，美擁護羅斯羅於此次出席國會席上表示焦慮，對所受慘重損害及進展遲滯，為意料所不及。部長繼謂，關於敵之侵　早於去年決定，並大事宣傳，於五六月間開始發動，故　軍於事前完成戰　準備，曾將東歐戰區縮小，移軍法國，在法北之　司令官，由向在北非及義大利負盛名之羅美爾氏充任，羅氏歷與英美軍作戰，指揮經騐監富，深信德軍今番必予英美軍以頂大之打擊。且亦可謂德軍靜待應美軍決戰之良好機會，從客予以殲滅之。</p>
<p>法國民衆抱怨萬分</p>
<p>旋部長又封法國民衆因遭受敵軍之侵歐，難免有受損失，謂在各方對法國民衆之痛苦，深表同情，誰料英美陰謀叵測，竟造詣稱法國民衆不顧為德協助，有親英美之趨向，從中煽動不息，但至今日我人已深切明白法國民衆莫不對英美有不良影象，如日前在英美保護之下特戈爾所發表之布告大表不滿，蓋艾以英美軍如侵佔法國時，組織軍政府，桎　篾親法國，故等戈爾提出今後當難願為英美協力，次如美降落傘部隊之暴　，濫炸無辜民衆，如人型炸彈等足引起法國民衆，抱怨萬分，當美空軍降落時，民衆無不追敵包圍，將其擊斃，此已足證法國民衆對英美之反感。是以敵英美之侵歐困難頗多，且必受慘重損失，　不國放棄此項作戰，增加援軍，作再度進攻之舉，期以擴大。深信今後英美結果，將遭受未有之重大損害，屆時英美國內民衆對政府之政策，當更表不滿，因損失愈大，民衆抱怨益甚，故此次英美之侵歐，實為我軸心之良好機會云云。</p>

<p>廿三比十八後來居上</p>
<p>本報助學金籃球義賽，中青戰西青，第一幕於昨（十二）日下午七時半，在八仙橋青年匯健身房舉行，中青以翟錫麟、吳成章、范慶公、張良雄，張　崙出陣，應戰西青之勃　，耶龍，浮尼克，　捷密洛夫，與柴遼，沙司金。由劉荷生，馮建維裁判，七時半鳴笛開球，雙方來往，不下一分鐘，由西青罰中一分，旋又遼中一球，翟錫麟立還一球，孔廣益調出張良雄，局勢未見起色，西青一路領先，攻勢甚盛，以九比二占絕對優勢，自吳成章投中一球，接着范廣公還投中的，上半時西青以九比六占先。下半時開始中青努力反攻，由翟錫麟罰中一分，孔廣益投中追成各九平手。陶別林基吳成章互中，又成各十一，此為最緊張時刻。孔廣益時來運來，兩投兩中，中青遂以十五比十一超出。浮尼克立還一球，翟錫麟又連中兩球，以十九比十二占優勢。西青鬱鬱不得逞，調進　捷密洛夫，在勃脫及　連中兩球後　稍見起色，然翟錫麟又告中的，　而孔廣益亦罰中一球，西青在極力反攻之下，捷　密洛夫攻中一球，大戰結束，中青卒以二十三比八反敗為勝。</p>
<p>次幕定十四日在原址舉行，想必定有更精彩演出、屆時中青將以卓國榮、馬燐希、何金貴等應戰，賽前或將邀請女子表演，至於何隊，尚未接洽妥當，屆時更將轟動球迷，票數有限，幸勿失之交臂。</p>

<h3 id="c43">國民論壇搶救農村 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 楊肅</p>
<p>前幾天，筆者因為偶然的機會，到離滬不遠的某一個鄕鎭上去住了幾天，耳聞目見，獲得了不少驚心楊目的資料，深覺今日的鄕村，沉淪於罪惡與痛苦的深洲中，如果不以雷霆萬鈞之力，去搶救目前的危機，那末不久的將來，一定會墮於萬却不復的地步。</p>
<p>政治的黑暗是今日鄉村動亂的　結所在。其實今日鄕村中那裏談得上政治，簡直整天在那裏敲剝，經常的如路燈捐，保甲捐，敎育捐，衛生捐，公益捐等等。臨時的更為出奇，有些是奉命而行的，如淸鄕用到毛竹，就有毛竹捐，獻機有捐，搜集廢兩爛鐵又有捐，捐的數目是自定的，解繳的數目也沒有人去過問。至於如奉命收購米糧之類，那更是好買賣，譬如上峯規定每農戶照限價出售米糧四斗，照保甲戶收取，區中接到了命令，區長會加收二三斗，警察局長也會加收二三斗，其下鄉鎭保甲長各可加收一二斗，於是實際要繳解一石多了。至於米款，上而發下來，他們可以　不轉發，或者打上一個折扣。甚而至於鄕人解到的米，也可以在沒，待上峯催逼，再去妝第二次。歙錢的方法還有更巧妙的，譬如他們可以籍口提倡體育，舉行一個運動會，或者假　保護兒童，舉行一次健康比賽，於是每戶又得　派臨時捐款，主辦者拿出一小部分買些獎品，其餘又可飽入私囊了。更有是以繁榮巿班唱申曲或是脫書的，於是成千成萬的印就戲票，按戶硬派，幾十萬元的盈利，自然易如反掌。</p>
<p>區公所是如此，等而下之的保甲長等當然也不甘落後。譬如一保之內，要製備釘在門口的一塊木木牌費超過幾倍的費用。，要砌一垜磚墻，明天為了衛生，　沒一只垃圾箱，後天……這些那些，都是保甲長的外快。</p>
<p>以上是就文的機關說，至於一般特殊階級，當然更有辦法。許多特殊的營業如賭窟烟窟按月都得孝敬一　頗為可觀的錢。他們可以派人，在交通要口攔截「私米」，整船整艘的充「公」，同時却又派人押船，自己去走私。</p>
<p>烟賭之盛行，實在可驚。現在鄕間因為嗎啡售儷較康，而且吸食便利，所以一般原吃鴉片的，多改食嗎啡，新吸嗎啡的，更是不可勝數。二十歲上下的鄕村靑年，十分之四五是嗎啡　者。</p>
<p>至於賭風之熾，也是於今為烈。每一　小茶館中，成天成晚有人在那裏公開賭博。賭法之精奇，上海人恐望塵莫及，而贏之大，尤令人咋舌，每局五千塊一萬塊的進出，算是最普通的。有些人是賭田地，賭物資（如豆幾担，米幾石），價是荒乎其唐，聞所未聞。</p>
<p>最危險的是一般靑年人，由於敎育的廢地，當然受不着正當的敎餋，造成游手好閒的風氣，十幾歲的孩子，就巳口　香烟，精於賭博了。更其是一切無恥的事，他們都會坦然的去做。</p>
<p>總之，今日的鄕村，其所埋藏的危機，實在更甚於都市。這是我們民族當前最嚴重的課題，我們應該大聲疾呼：搶救農村</p>
<p>海軍畫家（一）</p>
<h3 id="c44">海軍 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>隆夫決心辭掉巴里堂宣傳部的工作，而專心從事於畫工。他本想自己維持自己的生活，以達目的，但作事則除星期天外是沒有時間去看海的，所以最後只有辭職。</p>
<p>然而自從開始領父親的學曼後，他的精神反更加緊張了。不久後，母親和枝妹來的信，愈加該勵了他的勇氣。</p>
<p>——哥哥若是男子漢大丈夫，就當了著名畫家後，衣錦歸鄕吧！</p>
<p>妹妹的强烈性情，充滿於字裏行間，同時她的目做，也充分表現出來。</p>
<p>——東京那個地方一定很好吧！我在明年就在聖母女學院畢業，想到在這樣偏僻的地方過一輩子，眞有點令人氣憤。毅然決然逃出家鄉的哥哥，或許是勇敢的人生戰士。</p>
<p>隆夫讓到此處，便不能不聯想到妹妹也巳經成為十七歲的女孩子了。回信說東京生活決非幸福，但妹妹又來信指責哥哥那樣大人似的神氣活現。</p>
<p>自從確定工作目標後，隆夫就開始這個也研究那個也硏究，而總覺得時間何貴。因為自己認為必須瞭解海洋，並描畫海洋，所以就　遛在房州和伊豆，而開始從事寫生。然而海這樣大自然，向正面來看，是茫茫無垠的。過去從未想到波瀾的樣子，是有這樣多的種類，是這樣難於捉摸，而分不開的天空與　彩，也同樣是千變萬化的。雖然生下來就愛海，但實際上對於海的知識，是非常缺欠的。過去從未想到，就是　海，也是一生的工作。</p>
<p>然而，海洋畫家的他，於是大開眼界。無論那一張畫，都在短期內不入他的意，然而一氣畫了很多張。儘管如此，他所以不絕望者，乃是海洋的誘惑力牢牢捉住了他的心靈所致。</p>
<p>在這個時期，東京成為他的僑居地，而受徵兵檢查了。證明前此海軍經理學校的檢查並沒錯，即仇的體格此次被斷定為丙種。然而他並不去反省，現在他對於「海軍」的怨恨，業已從久重潰的那天起，而消逝了於無形了。</p>
<p>（我又回到原來的我了。而是逆着潮流游泳，而是又被波浪推到岸上來了。這就好了。）</p>
<p>他的心情，又像在天保山濱遊玩時一樣，而回天眞爛漫的時期了（一〇〇）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Educating the Next Generation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>A society, a nation, and a people are a continuous, organic entity. This organic entity requires the constant effort of individuals from all aspects to maintain its perpetual existence. The magnitude of everyone's effort and the duration of their endeavors determine how large and how long this organic entity can exist. Therefore, every individual has the right to be nurtured and educated by the previous generation, and every individual has the obligation to nurture the next generation.</p>
<p>In China, the work of educating the next generation is even more important than in other countries. China has been a closed-off nation. Since the opening of its ports, it has lagged behind in all aspects, constantly failing because it could not catch up with others. In the past century, China has barely managed to maintain a thread of life, and the pressure from its environment has constantly suffocated it. To make a place for ourselves as individuals and as a nation in this great era, we must redouble our efforts to catch up. Our current efforts and our future efforts to educate the next generation are all aimed at enabling our descendants to survive. Only through such continuous efforts can we make China increasingly prosperous and let the Chinese nation shine.</p>
<p>In present-day China, the work of educating the next generation is even more urgent than in other countries. After more than a century of Anglo-American aggression, the nation has been oppressed to the point of collapse. Fortunately, in this Greater East Asia War, everything in China must be decided by the Chinese themselves. As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." The responsibility for planting the seeds lies with the Chinese people of today. We can imagine the future of China by observing how we educate the next generation. If we hope that China will become an independent nation in the future, we must first educate our children to become independent individuals. This is a good opportunity, but if we fail to seize it, it will be as if we never had it.</p>
<p>Educating the next generation is a task of cultivating people for a century, a difficult task. The most important thing, simply put, is to give the next generation the opportunity to be educated. If we do not first give the compatriots of the next generation the opportunity to study, we cannot even begin to discuss the future of the next generation of China. This is undoubtedly the responsibility of the national government, but at the same time, it is a matter for the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, the entire society should do its utmost to help with this work. We in the journalistic field have taken a stand, and in recent years have focused on advocating for scholarship assistance, with the sole purpose of achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Now, the Seventh Scholarship Assistance Campaign has begun. With the social and economic situation deteriorating, it is unknown how many more young people will be forced to drop out of school next semester. Think about it, if we do not find ways to remedy this, and the next generation is full of ignorant and unemployed compatriots, is there any hope for China's future? Are we willing to be selfish individuals who only care about their own generation? Are we willing to see our nation head down the path of destruction? If not, we must rise up, we must all help with this work of educating the next generation of our compatriots. Recently, our newspaper held football and basketball games, and all the people of Shanghai were our sponsors. The enthusiastic atmosphere gave the organizers a lot of courage. Social sympathy is most valuable, and social awareness is most clear. The scholarship assistance campaign is only the starting point for the work of educating the next generation. We hope that everyone will help with this starting point.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Conducts Night Raids; The Enemy Retreats Behind the Baleier Line; A Valiant Aerial Battle Unfolds South of Bishenpur <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The main force of the enemy's 20th Division in the Baleier area previously launched desperate counterattacks, but after being pressured by the Japanese army, it became increasingly shaken and is now retreating. Before the enemy's retreat, the elite Japanese troops braved all difficulties to repeatedly engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat and night raids, causing the enemy's First 180th Brigade to collapse due to unbearable pressure. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to strike the flank of the Japanese army directly from near the Tanknopal road junction. They began their retreat quietly at midnight on the 7th. The enemy forces on the main road and to the north also began to collapse and retreat towards the Baleier area. At that time, the Japanese army units, seeing that the opportunity was not to be missed, suddenly launched a fierce attack, clearing out the stubborn enemy forces near the Tanknopal northern road junction and to its east. Other units echoed the attack, expanding their gains in the Sitongi and Falburen areas, and launched a fierce attack from the main road. The sound of artillery fire echoed loudly, shaking the entire war zone.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 8th, while bombing Imphal, the Japanese warplane unit in Burma encountered four enemy Hurricane fighter planes 15 kilometers south of Bishenpur. A fierce aerial battle ensued, and the Japanese planes shot down all of them instantly (one of which was not confirmed). In addition, the Japanese planes also encountered an enemy P-51 patrolling the sky above the Imphal southern airfield, and immediately shot it down. The Japanese planes then safely returned after completing their mission.</p>
<p>Battle Situation in Northern Burma</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Chongqing "Central News Agency" front-line special correspondent, the battle situation in the Myitkyina area is not progressing smoothly. A special unit led by American officers was assisting in the battle in the Myitkyina area, and the unit advanced to the east bank of the Irrawaddy River. However, since the night of the 7th, the Japanese army has launched a fierce attack on the Yu army west of that area. Furthermore, the American air force has been unable to launch large-scale operations due to unfavorable weather conditions, and has only been active in northern Burma.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The main forces of the Yu army's 116th, 130th, and 3603rd Divisions advanced to the banks of the Nujiang River in order to open up a new supply line to the Yu army. However, they were ambushed by the Japanese army and have been defeated. On the 6th of last month, several hundred Yu soldiers attacked from the Burmese side, but the Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. The bodies abandoned by the Yu army alone have been confirmed to number over 290. At the same time, several hundred Yu soldiers who invaded the Lameng surrounding area were also routed under the fierce shooting of the Japanese army, with only 184 survivors. Furthermore, the Yu paratroopers who landed around Myitkyina in northern Burma have suffered heavy losses as the Japanese army's rear units have reinforced their positions and gradually tightened the encirclement. A captured Yu army division commander of the newly formed XX Division requested reinforcements from the rear, stating that "losses are too heavy, especially among cadres, so please send 50 officers and generals quickly." The prisoner-of-war camp also stated that the losses among the Yu army cadres in that area include three battalion commanders killed in action and two battalion commanders and two company commanders wounded. Therefore, the Yu army in that area appears to have suffered a severe blow.</p>
<p>Indian Soldiers Revolt Against the British and Are Weary of War</p>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to recent enemy intelligence, the British High Command has recently implemented strict inspections of all letters sent to British Indian soldiers and the families and friends of Indian soldiers. It has also issued orders strictly prohibiting Indian soldiers from meeting with ordinary Indians. These measures are actually due to the fact that, after the release of Gandhi, they are deeply concerned that Gandhi's achievement of complete Indian independence and the idea of demanding the British withdrawal from India will influence the Indian soldiers. Therefore, the British High Command is extremely worried. Moreover, the Indian soldiers, who are treated differently, are increasingly displaying war-weariness and anti-British sentiment. Therefore, the British authorities have recently been working hard to strengthen the special surveillance units over the Indian troops, urging the troops to fight and investigating the anti-opposition sentiments of the Indian soldiers. The morale of the Indian soldiers stationed in the country has been completely lost. Previously, there was a clash between an Indian army unit and a British special surveillance unit in Assam. A few days ago, another conflict occurred between an Indian army unit stationed in Madras and the British army. At the same time, there are also actions of open desertion and resistance to superiors, and the British Indian High Command is in a state of panic and at a loss for what to do. According to recent reports, they intend to reorganize the structure of the front-line troops, forming mixed British-Indian units in order to supervise the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Allies from All Walks of Life are Concerned About Chairman's Health; Their Sincere and Earnest Concerns are Moving <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Minister Chu's remarks upon his return to Nanjing have already appeared in the newspapers. This reporter recently met Minister Chu at a memorial meeting, where he said that the concern of the allies from all walks of life for the Chairman's health was truly inspiring. During his time in Tokyo, he met with people from all levels of the allied nations, and almost everyone inquired about the Chairman's condition. The sincerity and earnestness of their intentions were deeply appreciated. He also said that he had hosted a banquet for General Abe and accepted General Abe's invitation, meeting with him several times. The concern was particularly evident. When the General was touring various places, people would inquire about the Chairman's health whenever they met him. This shows that the concern of the allies from all walks of life for the Chairman's health was not merely a display of friendship in front of the Chinese people. The intellectuals of those countries have a deep understanding of the importance of the relationship between China and Japan, and they have a great respect for the Chairman's noble character. Their sincerity and earnestness are revealed unconsciously, which is truly admirable. Minister Chu also said that when he was in Tokyo, he told the allies that since the Chairman went abroad for medical treatment, the central ministries and departments and the provincial and local agencies in China have been able to maintain their positions and work hard, just as when the Chairman was in the country. The allies all expressed their deep comfort upon hearing this.</p>

It went on to announce the true nature of British and American aid to the Yu side, revealing their ambition to colonize China, and claimed that the Henan operation was also intended to make the Yu side reflect. It called on the Yu side to quickly awaken.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Yu army authorities announced on the 11th that the fighting on the Hunan front, on the outer defensive line northeast of Changsha, is intensifying.

<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - With the Japanese army rapidly advancing in Hunan, Changsha, the 9th War Zone of the Yu army, is facing an imminent crisis of falling. A Chongqing dispatch from the United Press on the 10th also acknowledged that the defense of Changsha is on the verge of despair. The dispatch stated that, due to the previous three battles for Changsha, the citizens of Changsha had been completely evacuated, and the entire city had been completely turned into a defensive position. After receiving Chiang Kai-shek's order to defend to the death, the Yu army has stored a large amount of food and ammunition in preparation for fierce fighting. The boats and sailboats on the Xiang River have been completely moved to the south. The city of Changsha is filled with machine guns, and sandbags are piled up everywhere in the streets. The mountains around Changsha are also filled with fortifications. However, the Changsha defense forces were already in a state of despair before the Japanese army's attack.</p>
<p>Japanese Army on the Longhai Railway Reaches Lingshi</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the fall of Luoyang, the Chongqing authorities have been paying close attention to the movements of the Japanese army on the Henan front. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Japanese army is continuing to advance west along the Longhai Railway and has now reached Lingshi. Lingshi is only 164 kilometers from Tongguan, so the Chongqing authorities must be feeling a great threat.</p>
<p>Religious Groups Cooperate with Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Less than a month after the Japanese army conquered Henan Province, various religious groups in Henan Province, who had been groaning under the high pressure of the Yu army in the past, have voluntarily applied to the Japanese army units stationed in various places to participate in the work of building a paradise, and have expressed their sincerity in cooperating with Japan. In order to exchange views and promote mutual understanding, they have decided to convene a religious conference in the near future to gather representatives from all factions. After the troops were stationed, due to the implementation of the new policy based on the principle of "no entry, no supply, no labor," the people who had temporarily believed the Yu army's false propaganda about Japan were greatly moved, and their trust in the Japanese army grew day by day. As a result, various religious groups, the core of the people's thinking, took the lead in requesting to cooperate with the Japanese army.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Strict Measures Taken Internally to Eliminate Opium and Narcotics; Vice Minister Yuan Reports on Three Recent Tasks <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 3 p.m. on the 12th, the Ministry of Interior held a routine meeting with reporters in the Ministry's auditorium, presided over by Vice Minister Yuan. More than ten Chinese and foreign reporters from various news agencies and newspapers attended. Vice Minister Yuan reported on three areas: opium suppression, civil affairs, and police administration, which lasted until 5 p.m. The main points are as follows. Regarding the problem of opium suppression, first, the opium suppression regulations, according to the National Government's outline for opium suppression, in addition to a three-year ban on opium, absolutely prohibit narcotics and adopt a policy of immediate and thorough eradication. The laws for suppressing narcotics are also strict, and those who cannot be convicted under the general criminal law are now subject to the law for punishing narcotics offenses, which has already been implemented. Second, regarding the problem of opium suppression and investigation, on May 13 of this year, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of an independent agency, the Opium and Narcotics Investigation Office, and first established branch offices in four areas: Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Yangzhou, to carry out investigation work. In areas where branch offices have not been established, the Executive Yuan has ordered local police agencies to be responsible for the work. The Investigation Office is exclusively responsible for the smuggling and trafficking of opium and narcotics, while the Opium Suppression Bureau is responsible for the registration of the people, the management and distribution of licensed sellers, and the management of registered officials. Regarding civil affairs, the issue of strengthening local administrative organs is currently being studied, that is, reforming the current administrative supervisor system, based on administrative simplification and county administrative reform. The detailed measures will likely be decided at the next Executive Yuan meeting. The greatest goal of this county administrative reform is to strengthen county administration, especially county finances, and the promotion of the baojia system is currently being actively promoted. Regarding police administration, the widespread abolition of stations, city gates, and docks since January of this year has been welcomed by travelers. However, the Ministry has received reports from various parties that many policemen are outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, and are engaging in various obstructive behaviors at stations and other places. Therefore, the Ministry has specifically ordered all police agencies to pay attention to preventing policemen from engaging in illegal behavior at stations and other places, so as to reduce the suffering of travelers.</p>
<h3 id="e11">North and French Armies Continue to Reinforce, Fully Compete for Cherbourg Peninsula, German Side Announces Withdrawal from Carentan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: Both sides in Western Europe have mobilized a large number of reinforcements, especially in the American landing beachhead area, from near Signy, east of the Vire River estuary, along the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula (also known as the Cherbourg Peninsula), northward to Ouineville. Large detachments of fresh enemy troops are landing, and these reinforcements are carrying a large number of heavy weapons. The northern part of the landing beachhead, between Montebourg and Quineville, was relatively calm on the morning of the 11th. At the same time, the American army group commander in the area launched a larger formation, covered by tanks, to launch an attack on Carentan, but the German troops in the area are still holding their ground firmly. The American formation exerted strong pressure from Signy to the southwest, but also failed to achieve success. The intention of the anti-Axis forces is to penetrate the entire peninsula to the west coast, then blockade its northern part to defend against attacks from the south, in order to carry out a mopping-up operation there, and to make the peninsula the main base for the second phase of the invasion war. General Montgomery, on the evening of the 10th and the 11th, together with newly landed detachments in the invasion area, mobilized approximately twenty divisions, of which seven to eight divisions are believed to be casualties.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: Huitong News Agency reports: For two days, the anti-Axis forces have been reinforcing France, mostly by sea landings, as glider transport has been hampered by heavy rain. The British army landed at the mouth of the Orne River, and the American army landed at the mouth of the Vire River. The enemy's landing point is about twenty kilometers deep, with an average of only a few kilometers.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German News Agency quoted an official German war report as saying: All enemy attempts to expand southward from Caen and Bayeux have been crushed, and their attempts to advance towards Cherbourg north of the Vire River estuary have also failed. German troops only withdrew from Carentan after fierce fighting. The two Laude artillery batteries along the Stvaast coast east of Cherbourg continue to bombard enemy fleets with heavy artillery. German reserve troops are standing by to be deployed. Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: Huitong News Agency military affairs reporter Setorius said that the German troops dispatched by the German High Command to fight on the Normandy Peninsula are only a small part of the reserve force. The remaining reserve troops are all on standby to be deployed. It is still difficult to say for sure whether the German army has launched a major counter-offensive on the Cotentin Peninsula and the Calvados coast, as the German authorities believe that the enemy's landing in Normandy is only the first step in the invasion of Europe, and that other enemy forces with equally strong forces may land at any time elsewhere in Europe. However, before the situation in Normandy stabilizes, the British and Americans are unlikely to launch other landing operations immediately. The British and American headquarters in the British mainland have enough troops to launch landings elsewhere, but their entire air force and most of their navy have already participated in the Normandy campaign. Speaking of the enemy air force units, they have suffered heavy losses in this landing battle, so when landing elsewhere, although the enemy still has ordinary land forces to serve as airborne troops, technically speaking, their combat effectiveness is not as good as that of airborne soldiers who have received several years of special training.</p>

<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German authorities announced on the 11th: Since the beginning of the anti-Axis invasion operations, up to now, the German army has sunk twenty-nine anti-Axis transport ships, totaling 107,000 tons. In addition, the landing boats sunk and the ones that were not yet confirmed are not included.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a report from the London United Press, since the 10th, the German army has gathered a large number of submarines to attack the supply routes of the anti-Axis forces in the English Channel, in order to engage in fierce battles with the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Artillery Battery Power</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that the German fortress and outer artillery battery near Cherbourg destroyed at least eight hundred ships of various sizes in the four days of the invasion campaign. In the coastal area about three kilometers long in front of the fortress, there were a total of 4,400 enemy soldiers' bodies, but in the same period, only six German soldiers were killed or injured inside the fortress.</p>
<p>Air Warfare</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German authorities announced on the 11th: German fighter planes attacked a large enemy convoy escorted by warships in the waters of Caen on the evening of the 10th, and sank nine large ships of 20,000 tons and nine transport ships of 8,000 tons in just a few minutes. Enemy ships came to the rescue but were also hit and suffered heavy damage. In addition, one transport ship of 10,000 tons was also hit. The German fighter squadron also launched a fierce attack on the enemy units approaching the Vire River estuary, and several enemy special landing boats that were about to land were also hit and damaged.</p>

American tanks are focusing on the area between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the upper reaches of the Tiber River, exerting major pressure to the west. North of Zataipa, the enemy is forcefully crossing the Furia River and advancing towards Lake Bolsena. When the enemy attempted to advance north and east across the river, a major battle unfolded on the Tiber River. A few days ago, a major battle also took place near Grignano. Although the fighting on the western front is fierce, it is only a small contact between the rear guard teams. Bopo and others have completed the task of preventing the enemy from encircling them.</p>

<h3 id="e22">North and French Armies Continue to Reinforce, Fully Compete for Cherbourg Peninsula, German Side Announces Withdrawal from Carentan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: Both sides in Western Europe have mobilized a large number of reinforcements, especially in the American landing beachhead area, from near Signy, east of the Vire River estuary, along the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula (also known as the Cherbourg Peninsula), northward to Quineville. Large detachments of fresh enemy troops are landing, and these reinforcements are carrying a large number of heavy weapons. The northern part of the landing beachhead, between Montebourg and Quineville, was relatively calm on the morning of the 11th. At the same time, the American army group commander in the area launched a larger formation, covered by tanks, to launch an attack on Carentan, but the German troops in the area are still holding their ground firmly. The American formation exerted strong pressure from Signy to the southwest, but also failed to achieve success. The intention of the anti-Axis forces is to penetrate the entire peninsula to the west coast, then blockade its northern part to defend against attacks from the south, in order to carry out a mopping-up operation there, and to make the peninsula the main base for the second phase of the invasion war. General Montgomery, on the evening of the 10th and the 11th, together with newly landed detachments in the invasion area, mobilized approximately twenty divisions, of which seven to eight divisions are believed to be casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Aircraft and Artillery Concentrated Bombardment, Beginning to Attack Caen <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, December 13th, Central News Agency: According to front-line news, the anti-Axis air force concentrated its bombing on Caen with a large number of medium bombers and fighter-bombers on the 10th. The bombing of Kanesi was a concentrated bombing of a military area. Also, on the same day, anti-Axis aircraft bombed the northern tip of the Cherbourg Peninsula.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to news, the anti-Axis fleet in the Seine Bay is currently launching a fierce artillery bombardment of the city of Caen, and the entire city is shrouded in thick smoke. The city's large steel factory, located not far from the coast, is a good target for British naval artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: The British army has gathered a large army north of Caen, which shows that the army will attack the area today. The German side said that if the enemy does not occupy Caen, the mouth of the Orne River can never be used for landing operations.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces are clearly planning to make every effort to attack the city of Caen. A large number of troops and military equipment landed behind the British front lines north of Caen on the 10th. These reinforcements were transported by glider. At night, the enemy dropped a large number of paratroopers south of Caen in the German positions. Since the British command formed a new focus north and northwest of it, it is speculated that the anti-Axis high command is eager to occupy the city. The fact that the German army regained the left bank of the Orne River dealt a major blow to the enemy's invasion plan. This can be proved by the British army being forced to cross the river with a strong tank force to the east bank to attack the German defensive positions from the south. The British tank forces occupied two strongholds, and the German army retreated northward.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Invasion Army Uses New Weapons, Gliders Transporting Tanks <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a report from London, the most cherished secret weapon of the British has been officially revealed last night. This weapon is named "Hamil Rate". It is a huge glider that can carry two fast light tanks or other heavy weapons and is now being used in Normandy front positions. Its two wings are stretched out, which is larger than the "Lansder" type. It is towed by a heavy American bomber, but the control is extremely flexible, and a small landing strip is enough for it to land. Whether day or night, a few miles away from the target, the towing cable is removed, and this aircraft can land on its own with almost mathematical accuracy. When it silently descends towards the target, the sound of a motor suddenly comes on. This motor is installed on the "tank with a large steel cannon" carried on the aircraft. The crew turns it on in advance. As soon as the aircraft lands, the tank starts to move.</p>
<h3 id="e25">What is the Soviet Union's Attitude Towards Jiangsu? <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Reclusive Scholar of Jiangnan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Anglo-American invasion of Europe, the question "What is the Soviet Union's attitude?" has been of concern to the world. The Allied forces thought that it would be great if the Soviet Union could respond to their landing operation and launch a full-scale offensive. It has been a week since the Allied forces set foot on a corner of Normandy. Although the landing has been temporarily successful, Roosevelt and Churchill have both declared that the subsequent battles will be extremely difficult. Of course, everyone knows that such a great war, no matter how much they can take advantage of, they cannot simply whistle and drive straight into Berlin! But they are thorough utilitarians. In any situation, they are calculating: "To obtain the greatest effect with the least sacrifice." Therefore, the more difficult the war, the more they want to transfer the sacrifices they have suffered to others. This is natural in their base merchant nature. After the landing operation began, if the Red Army took a counter-offensive posture in the Yeshi area, they would be very happy: "Ah! The Red Army's major offensive has begun." However, the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement used extremely cold sentences: "No major changes on the front lines." Anglo-American commentators! Please calm down. Open a military dictionary and look for terms such as "Counterattack", "Counteroffensive", and "Offensive"!</p>
<p>Chongqing, thousands of miles away from the landing battlefield, is also clamoring for the Soviet Union's total counter-offensive in response to the Anglo-American invasion of Europe to begin soon. This is like a puppy yelling at a bear that is coldly watching the tigers and wolves fighting, inciting the bear to join the fight. However, the bear, which has never considered them to be opponents, remains unmoved. The Ta Kung Pao said on the 10th:</p>
<p>"According to Berlin reports, only a very small number of German troops stationed here have been mobilized to deal with the danger from the West. However, Spenlin seems to be waiting for some German troops on the Eastern Front to move west."</p>
<p>Then, let us try to give the most accurate answer to the question "What is the Soviet Union's attitude?" It is indeed very simple. "The Soviet Union will decide whether to take a major offensive based on its own position. If it takes a major offensive, it will choose the time and place that it deems appropriate."</p>
<p>Originally, the Anglo-American invasion of Europe seemed to be taking the form of fulfilling the Soviet Union's demand for a second front against Germany, but that is not the case. In the most difficult times of the Soviet Union's war of resistance against Germany, it regarded Britain's promise as a talisman and demanded the opening of a second front as a means to save the Soviet Union from its difficulties. However, in this era, Britain and the United States broke their promises and did not fulfill them. After the Soviet Union paid a great sacrifice, it gradually turned to the offensive. At the same time, the Soviet Union's political pressure on Europe gradually strengthened. Therefore, Britain and the United States launched the landing operation. On the surface, it seems that they are starting a comprehensive assistance to the Soviet Union under the common war goal of defeating "Hitler Germany". However, Britain and the United States are not "for the Soviet Union", but are rushing to the European continent "for themselves". The beachhead they set up in northern France is for the attack on Germany, and also a political and military beachhead to deal with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union understands this attempt by Britain and the United States very well. Therefore, the Red Army's official newspaper "Red Star" said:</p>
<p>"The military operations in Normandy can be said to be only fulfilling a secondary task. The main direction of the Allied forces' attack will soon be clear."</p>
<p>Although the Allied forces that landed in Normandy have considerable forces, it is too early to think that they can give Germany a decisive blow. In other words, the second front defined by the Soviet Union has not yet begun. The more fiercely the Allied forces fight in northern France in the future, the stronger the demand from Britain and the United States for the Red Army to launch a major offensive from the east. Britain and the United States, who launched the "invasion of Europe" in response to the Soviet Union, have now turned around and demanded that the Soviet Union open a "first front" against Germany.</p>
<p>The anxiety and disbelief that the Soviet Union has experienced before will now be tasted by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>On the night of the 11th, the Soviet Intelligence Bureau announced that it had launched an offensive in the Karelia region. Needless to say, there is still a long way to go between this and the major offensive coming from the east that Britain and the United States are demanding. But there is also an intention to launch a political offensive against Finland. We must pay attention to this: that is, the Soviet Union will launch an offensive from its own standpoint, at the time and place it wishes.</p>

<p>Believes the German Army Will Deal a Blow to British and American Forces</p>
<p>Information Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, at a regular press conference held yesterday (12th) afternoon for Chinese news reporters in this city, made the following remarks regarding the recent British and American forces' invasion of Europe:</p>
<p>A Major Blow Will Be Dealt to the British and Americans</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira began by saying that since the enemy British and American forces invaded Europe, more than five days have passed. The situation in the war zone seems to be rapidly changing. Enemy paratroopers have suffered strong attacks from the German army. The enemy navy invading along the coast, although having established a bridgehead at sea, has already suffered casualties of one-fourth. The remaining troops are in an extremely small area. The United States is worried about the severe losses and the slow progress. The Minister continued that the enemy's invasion was decided as early as last year and heavily publicized, with the attack launched between May and June. Therefore, the German army completed its war preparations in advance, reduced the Eastern European war zone, and moved troops to France. The commander in northern France is Field Marshal Rommel, who has a great reputation in North Africa and Italy. Rommel has experience fighting the British and American armies and is highly experienced in command. It is firmly believed that the German army will deal a major blow to the British and American forces this time. It can also be said that the German army is quietly waiting for a good opportunity to decisively engage the American army and annihilate them.</p>
<p>The French People Are Complaining Greatly</p>
<p>The Minister then said that the French people are inevitably suffering losses due to the enemy's invasion of Europe. He expressed deep sympathy for the suffering of the French people from all sides. He said that the treacherous British and Americans are claiming that the French people are disregarding assisting Germany and are inclined towards the British and Americans, constantly instigating unrest. But today we deeply understand that the French people have a poor impression of the British and Americans. For example, they are very dissatisfied with the proclamation issued by de Gaulle under the protection of the British and Americans, because de Gaulle believes that if the British and American armies occupy France, they will organize a military government and suppress the French people. Therefore, de Gaulle has stated that he will be unwilling to cooperate with the British and Americans in the future. Furthermore, the atrocities committed by the American paratroopers, such as indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians and the use of human-shaped bombs, have caused the French people to complain greatly. When American paratroopers land, the people surround and kill them, which is enough to prove the French people's antipathy towards the British and Americans. Therefore, the enemy British and Americans are facing many difficulties in invading Europe and will inevitably suffer heavy losses. They may not abandon this operation, but increase reinforcements and launch another attack, hoping to expand their territory. It is firmly believed that the British and Americans will suffer unprecedentedly serious damage in the future. At that time, the British and American people will be even more dissatisfied with their government's policies, because the greater the losses, the greater the people's complaints. Therefore, this invasion of Europe by the British and Americans is actually a good opportunity for our Axis powers.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Readers' Scholarship News Application Forms to be Issued Separately to Graduates and Transfer Students <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The application forms for the seventh session of the scholarship funded by readers of this newspaper have been issued to various schools yesterday. Some schools have as many as 30% of their students applying. If application forms are issued according to the number requested by each school, the total number will inevitably exceed 50,000. It is estimated that the fundraising target of this newspaper is 10 million yuan, but there is only half the assurance of reaching that amount. It is still difficult to estimate how much tuition fees will increase next semester. Allocating 5 million yuan, even if each person receives an average of 1,000 yuan, will only cover 5,000 people. If each person receives an average of 5,000 yuan, then only 1,000 people can be approved. If a large number of application forms are distributed, knowing that nineteen out of twenty cannot be approved, wouldn't that be close to deception? Therefore, it is difficult for various schools, which have many requests for accommodation, to comply after careful consideration by the office. However, in order to protect the interests of graduates and transfer students, the application forms for these students will be distributed separately from the others, but also not more than one-third of the other applicants. The application forms were distributed yesterday, already following this procedure. It is hoped that all schools will take note. These extra application forms are for graduates and transfer students only, and other students may not borrow them.</p>
<p>Competition in Practical Calligraphy Promotes Xiaoxiao The "Practical Calligraphy Competition" organized by this office closed on the 8th. More than 500 entries were received from aided students in various senior elementary schools and junior high schools. There were more entries in the brush calligraphy group. From each grade level, twelve entries were selected in each of the brush and fountain pen groups. However, because one person wrote in both brush and fountain pen styles, and often one person won two awards, it was deemed inappropriate. After consideration, the brush and fountain pen groups were merged, and each person was only allowed to be selected for one award. A total of eighty candidates were selected in the preliminary rounds for the five grade levels. The list is as follows. This office originally planned to hold the semi-finals in the coming days, but because the schools are in the middle of major exams, and the students do not have time for this, it has been decided to postpone the event. It will be postponed until after the 20th of this month. The date and procedures for the semi-finals will be announced at that time. Hope all qualified students pay special attention to the news released by this office, so as not to miss the opportunity.</p>

<p>23 to 18 Coming from Behind</p>
<p>In the basketball charity match for scholarships sponsored by this newspaper, Chinese Youth faced Western Youth. The first game was held yesterday (12th) at 7:30 p.m. at the YMCA gym on Eight Immortals Bridge. Chinese Youth started with Zhai Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, Fan Qinggong, Zhang Liangxiong, and Zhang Zhilun. They faced Western Youth's Bolin, Yelong, Founik, Chizhmelov, Chai Liao, and Saszkin. Liu Hesheng and Feng Jianwei were the referees. At 7:30 p.m., the whistle blew to start the game. Both sides exchanged blows for less than a minute. Western Youth scored one point from a free throw, and then Liao scored a field goal. Zhai Xilin immediately responded with a field goal. Kong Guangyi replaced Zhang Liangxiong, but the situation did not improve. Western Youth continued to lead, with a strong offensive, holding an absolute advantage of 9 to 2. Wu Chengzhang scored a field goal, followed by a field goal by Fan Guangong. At halftime, Western Youth led 9 to 6. At the start of the second half, Chinese Youth worked hard to counterattack. Zhai Xilin scored one point from a free throw, and Kong Guangyi scored a field goal, tying the score at 9 to 9. Taobielinsky and Wu Chengzhang each scored, bringing the score to 11 to 11, which was the most intense moment. Kong Guangyi had good luck, scoring two field goals, and Chinese Youth took the lead at 15 to 11. Founik immediately responded with a field goal. Zhai Xilin then scored two consecutive field goals, giving Chinese Youth an advantage at 19 to 12. Western Youth was frustrated and brought in Chizhmelov. After Bolin and Chai scored two field goals, they slightly improved. However, Zhai Xilin scored again, and Kong Guangyi also scored a free throw, giving Chinese Youth the advantage at 23 to 18. Under Western Youth's strenuous counterattack, Chizhmelov scored a goal. At the end of the battle, Chinese Youth finally reversed the defeat and won with a score of 23 to 18.</p>
<p>The next game is scheduled to be held at the same venue on the 14th, and it is expected to be even more exciting. At that time, Chinese Youth will counter with Zhuo Guorong, Ma Linxi, He Jingui, etc. A women's performance may be invited before the game. As for which team, it has not yet been confirmed. The event will be a sensation for fans. Tickets are limited, so don't miss the opportunity.</p>

<p>Confucius Cup Football Charity Match East China Defeats Overseas Chinese United</p>
<p>Two to Zero</p>
<p>The Confucius Cup Football Charity Match, East China versus Overseas Chinese United, was held yesterday afternoon at 5:30 at the Racecourse. Overseas Chinese United once again borrowed four generals from Tianjin, hoping to avenge their old grudges. Unexpectedly, East China won again, with a score of two to zero, scoring one goal in each half. Spectators braved the scorching heat and flocked to the event, creating an unprecedentedly grand and lively atmosphere. As the competition unfolded, Overseas Chinese United launched a fierce attack. East China counterattacked, and Youliang penetrated deep into the enemy's territory, attacking near the goal, but unfortunately, it was a few inches off. Longhai's two good attempts were both saved. Overseas Chinese United took advantage of East China's weak defense and launched a rapid counterattack. After Automali received a supply from the rear, he launched a cold arrow, but Zhang Banglun calmly saved it, and the audience applauded. East China counterattacked, and the front of Overseas Chinese United's goal was in danger. A Dai shot from fifteen yards out. Chiang Du Xue of Overseas Chinese United was eager to save the ball and committed a penalty of twelve yards. Old Sun's iron leg rose up and hit the center. One to zero, the first half ended. Changing sides and fighting again, East China's strength was slightly affected by Old Sun's retirement. Overseas Chinese United's offensive became stronger, and East China's situation was precarious. Fortunately, the defenders were effective. Soon, Old Sun made a comeback, and the offensive regained momentum. Li Zijiang revolted and used a trick to lure out Tai Duka near the goal, shooting to the lower right corner. Tai missed the ball completely. Han Longhai rushed forward and added a kick, and the ball went straight into the net. Two to zero, East China won the victory. After the match, Lin Genghou presented the awards. The charity ball was purchased by the seventy-two disciples of Confucius for a total of 720,000 yuan, with each contributing 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese United: Tai Duka, Luo Xucheng, Chiang Du Xue, Bolini, Xilati, Xueweitai, Dijianna (down), Bama, Automali, Autonilo, Baojie, Taikeni (up).</p>

<h3 id="e43">National Forum Rescuing the Countryside <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Su</p>
<p>A few days ago, I had the opportunity to stay for a few days in a township not far from Shanghai. What I heard and saw gave me a lot of shocking and alarming information. I deeply felt that today's countryside is sinking into the depths of sin and suffering. If we do not use thunderous force to rescue the current crisis, it will soon fall into a situation beyond recovery.</p>
<p>Political darkness is the crux of the turmoil in today's countryside. In fact, there is no politics to speak of in today's countryside. People are simply being exploited all day long. There are regular levies such as street light donations, baojia donations, education donations, health donations, public welfare donations, etc. There are even more bizarre temporary levies. Some are carried out under orders. For example, there is a bamboo donation when bamboo is used for Qingxiang, there is a donation for獻機, and there is a donation for collecting waste iron. The amount of the donation is determined by the local bosses, and no one asks about the amount remitted. As for the mandatory purchase of grain, it is even better business. For example, the higher-ups stipulate that each farmer should sell four dou of grain at a limited price. The district receives the order and collects it according to the baojia household. The district chief will collect an additional two or three dou, and the police chief will also collect an additional two or three dou. Each township baojia chief can collect an additional one or two dou. Therefore, in reality, more than one stone must be handed in. As for the money for the grain, if it is issued from above, they can simply not forward it, or give it a discount. To the extent that the grain delivered by the locals can also be embezzled, and when the higher-ups urge them, they will go through the motions for a second time. There are even more ingenious ways to make money. For example, they can use the excuse of promoting sports to hold a sports meeting, or protecting children, holding a health competition. Thus, each household will have to pay temporary donations, and the organizers will take out a small portion to buy some prizes, and the rest can be pocketed. Even more are the times when they are promoting class songs, Shanghai opera, or脱書. Hundreds of thousands of tickets are printed and distributed to households, and the profits of hundreds of thousands of yuan are naturally as easy as turning one's hand.</p>
<p>The district office is like this, and the baojia chiefs below are certainly not willing to lag behind. For example, within a bao, the cost of making a wooden sign to be nailed to the door exceeds the cost of the sign by several times. To build a brick wall, to install a trash can tomorrow for hygiene, and so on... these are all the baojia chief's extra income.</p>
<p>The above is about the established agencies. As for the general special classes, they certainly have even better ways. Many special businesses such as gambling dens and opium dens have to pay considerable money every month. They can send people to intercept "private grain" at transportation hubs, confiscating entire ships and vessels "for public use," while also sending people to escort ships and smuggle goods themselves.</p>
<p>The prevalence of opium and gambling is truly alarming. Nowadays, because morphine is cheaper than opium and easier to consume, most people who used to smoke opium in the countryside have switched to morphine. The number of new morphine addicts is even more countless. Four or five out of ten young people in the countryside around the age of twenty are morphine addicts.</p>
<p>As for the rampant gambling, it is even more severe today. In every small teahouse, people openly gamble all day and all night. The ingenuity of the gambling methods makes the Shanghai people pale in comparison, and the size of the winnings is even more astounding. Entering and exiting with 5,000 or 10,000 yuan per game is considered the most common. Some people gamble with land and materials (such as so many dan of beans, so many stone of rice). The prices are ridiculously absurd and unheard of.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing is that the general youth, due to the wasteland of education, certainly do not receive proper education, which creates a habit of idleness. Children in their teens are already smoking cigarettes and skilled at gambling. What's more, they will shamelessly do everything that is immoral.</p>
<p>In short, today's countryside harbors a crisis that is even greater than the city. This is the most serious issue facing our nation. We should loudly call out: Rescue the Countryside!</p>
<p>Naval Painter (1)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Navy <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Longfu resolved to resign from his work at the Paris-do advertising department and dedicate himself to painting. He originally intended to support himself to achieve his goal, but with work, he had no time to see the sea except on Sundays, so in the end, he had no choice but to resign.</p>
<p>However, since he began receiving his father's allowance, his spirit had become even more tense. Soon after, letters from his mother and younger sister further encouraged his courage.</p>
<p>——If you're a real man, big brother, come back home in glory after becoming a famous painter!</p>
<p>His sister's strong personality was filled between the lines, and her determination was fully expressed.</p>
<p>——Tokyo must be a wonderful place! I'll be graduating from Notre Dame Girls' Academy next year, and the thought of spending my whole life in such a remote place is really infuriating. Big brother, who resolutely escaped from home, is perhaps a brave warrior of life.</p>
<p>When Longfu read to this point, he couldn't help but think that his younger sister had already become a seventeen-year-old girl. He wrote back saying that life in Tokyo was by no means happy, but his sister wrote back scolding him for putting on such a pompous, adult-like air.</p>
<p>Since determining his work goal, Longfu began researching this and researching that, and always felt that time was precious. Because he believed he had to understand the ocean and depict the ocean, he lingered in Fangzhou and Izu and began to sketch from life. However, the ocean, such a great nature, is boundless when viewed head-on. He had never thought that the appearance of the waves had so many types, were so difficult to grasp, and that the inseparable sky and colors were also ever-changing. Although he was born loving the sea, he actually lacked knowledge of the sea. He had never thought that even just the sea would be a lifetime's work.</p>
<p>However, he, the marine painter, thus had his eyes opened. No matter which painting, it didn't meet his expectations in the short term, but he painted many in one go. Nevertheless, the reason he didn't despair was that the allure of the ocean firmly grasped his heart.</p>
<p>During this period, Tokyo became his temporary residence, and he was subject to conscription examination. It proved that the examination at the Naval Accounting School before was not wrong, that his physique was determined to be Grade C this time. However, he did not reflect on it; now, his resentment towards the "Navy" had vanished into thin air since the day of the Kure naval review.</p>
<p>(I've returned to my original self again. Instead of swimming against the tide, I'm being pushed back to shore by the waves again. That's fine.)</p>
<p>His mood was like when he was playing at Tenpozan beach, and he returned to a naive and innocent time. (100)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Nanshi Deaf-Mute School Launches Expansion Campaign <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Nanshi Luxiangyuan Road Deaf-Mute School was established two years ago, with the pure aim of promoting special education, compensating for physiological defects, cultivating deaf-mute children, teaching necessary knowledge, instilling suitable skills, and creating deaf-mute talents, hoping that poor deaf-mute children can all receive basic knowledge and skills training, so that they can all become useful talents. As the tuition fees of various deaf schools in Shanghai are surprisingly high, it has led to a sharp increase in the number of students in the school, and the original school building is not enough. It is hoped that the school building can be expanded to accommodate as many students as possible. However, this matter is of great importance, and it relies on the generous assistance of all sectors of society. There is no shortage of people in Shanghai who own real estate in the Nanshi district, and most of them are uninhabited, leaving them empty. Perhaps they can be generous and grant assistance. The deaf-mute will benefit directly, and indirectly, the society and the country will also benefit a lot.</p>
