<h3 id="c1">星期評論　士大夫 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 趙正平</p>
<p>自整個世界陷入戰爭狀態以來，交通破壊，物質闕乏，加以種種人爲的因素，物價暴漲，不知所止，一般人民生活，俱陷於恐慌艱苦之境，其中尤以薪水階級爲甚，薪水階級之中，尤以文化人與中央政治工作人員爲最甚，我國向來習慣，以作官爲顯榮，以讀書人爲高貴，而今此兩種人員，各以生活壓迫，漸懐厭棄，此實國家根本上之嚴重危機，不應不迅謀挽救者也。</p>
<p>旣成一國家，不能無政治，旣有政治，不能無從政人員，從政人員何自出，依據我國之國性，即出自讀書人，故仕之一字，其義爲學爲宦，宦之字義又可作官學生解，學與宦，即讀書人與作官根本相速帶而不能分離，故孔子亦有學而優則仕，仕而優則學之訓。再考歷史事實，幾千年來，不論任何時代，此全國官吏，未有不取之於士，行選舉制度（與現代所謂選舉不同）時如此，行考試制度時如此，現代行學校制度時亦如此。質言之，即全國書齋中之士，均爲廷省官吏之前身，而全國廷省官吏，無一不可爲書齋中之士，士大夫三字，形成一個固有名詞，士之與官，如此關係密切，猶如母子相生，故國史上號稱國運昌隆時代，共時政象，未有不注力於士之培養，而在敝展士類，甚至斯文掃地之時代，如五代史一個時期，又反映出其時之黑闇與衰落。今日之中國，雖在戰雲籠罩之下，然建設新中國復興新中國之大願，固爲時代之呼聲也，而乃學者與公務人員，各以生活壓迫，自身輕視其寶貴的使命，濁浪滔滔，江河日下，結果將致無文化可言，無政治可言，無國家可言，尙何建設與復興之有，此非國家最嚴重之根本危機乎</p>
<p>國史上極力尊重士人的時期，無過於宋，宋太祖甚至以不殺士大夫一條列爲遺囑之一，而鐫之石鎖，列之殿廷，命後世嗣君跪讀，其結果形成一春秋時代以後學術思想極盛時期，而宋末忠臣義士之照耀史乘，又爲我民族發揮莫大之光彩。史家稱爲開國初期，尊重士大夫之明效，然宋代大政治家王荊公尙且對養士一事，病切主張其改善的重要，在上仁宗言事書中，謂：</p>
<p>「方今制祿大抵皆薄，自非朝廷侍從之列，食口稍衆，未有不兼農商之利，而能充其養者也，共下州縣之吏，一月所得，多者錢八九千，少者四五千，以守選待除守闕通之，蓋六七年而後得三年之祿。討一月所得，乃實不能四五千，少者乃實不能及三四千而已，雖厮養之給，亦窘於此矣，而其養生喪死婚姻葬送之事，皆當於此出夫，出中人之上者，雖窮而不失爲君子，出中人之下者，雖泰而不失爲小人，惟中人不然，窮則爲小人，泰則爲君子，計天下之士，出中人之上下者，千百而無十一，窮而爲小人，泰而爲君子者，則天下皆是也。先王以爲衆不可以力勝也，故制行不以已，而以中人爲制，所以因其欲而利遭之，以爲中人之所能守，則其志可以行乎天下，而推之後世，以今之制祿，而欲士之無毀廉恥，蓋中人之所不爲也·故今官大者，往往交賂遺，營貲產，以負貪汚之毀，官小者，販　乞丐，無所不爲，夫士已嘗毀廉恥以負累於世矣，則其偷惰取容之意起，而矜奮自强之心息，則職業安得而不弛，治道何從而興乎，又况委法受賂，侵牟百姓者，往往而是也，此所謂不能饒之以財也。」</p>
<p>荊公此論，爲陶冶人才之一節，雖針對宋時，然亦可謂針對現時，其所謂厮養之卒亦窘於此矣等語，尤完全爲現時寫實，我政府當局，固以復興新中國，建設新中國爲職志者也，於此國家命脈根本所在之義士一事，無論環境如何艱難，要當以荊公之心爲心，將荊公指陳之時弊，設法針救之，此非爲若干文化人與公務人員之個人計，實國家政治上正本淸源之大計，非此將何以建立政治，他姑不言，卽就我國郵政海關等機關施政效率言，因關於年功加俸恩俸養老金退職金均有特殊規定，與普通行政機關不同，故此項公務人員，在事變前向稱專心率公，不輕見異思遷，行政效率，大著而特著，更就日本文官（大中小各學校敎員均爲文官之一種）待遇言，關於年功加俸恩俸退職金養老金等種種，亦均有明白規定，與我國郵政機關等完全相似，故服公務者亦均能安心供職，行政效率大著而特著。我國如欲復興，非賴有多數學者，或專心研究，（大學敎授不僅爲敎師實兼自身之研究）或努力奉公不可，如果號稱士大夫而月懐生活不支之懼，結果必致多數人民，失却靈魂，大多數機關，僅成具文，質言之，是下無學上無政也。故祭茲物價無論如何騰貴，財政無論如何困難，惟獨此國本所繫之士大夫，至少必須遠溯數千年來國性，近顧中外通則，立一保陣生活之根本大計，以免爲戰爭時代之犧牲者，想我士大夫出身之政府當局，於此必早有同情。</p>
<p>然就士大夫木身一方面言，亦當乘此艱苦時期，發揮共領導羣倫之眞價，所謂眞價者何在，則安貧樂道精神是矣。孟子謂民無恒產，即無恒心，無恒心則放僻邪侈無不爲矣·此與管子所謂倉廩實而知禮節，衣食足而知榮辱，完全同一語氣，然孟子獨於士特設一例外，言無恒產而有恒心者惟士爲能。此所謂士，當然可適用於士大夫，此語引申之，卽言倉廩不食而士仍知禮節，衣食不足而士仍知榮辱，故孔子亦言君子窮則固，小人窮斯濫，孟子更設天爵與人爵之別，以獎進士大夫孜孜於仁義忠信樂善不倦之天爵，以獎進士大夫護持其富貴不能淫貧賤不能移之理想的人格，我士大夫如一念自身爲國家命脈所繫，今日之士卽他日之大夫，今日之大夫，卽他日之士，再念一簞食一瓢欽不改其樂之聖賢態度，更念士之人格與普通不同，普通人大槪心爲形役，惟士能以精神尅制物質，而超然保持其學不厭誨不倦與夫不忮不求本色，以抗時代濁流，猶如孟子所謂天將降大任於是人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身之一章所示，則今日所受種種生活壓迫，俱爲磨練我人之試金石，俱爲表顯士大夫眞價値之機遇，國家民族前途，將寄託於此，尙何貧窮之可憂可慮，此又我所致望於所謂士大夫者也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍嚴重哨戒下　太平洋無新動向　必阿克海上擊傷敵船兩艘 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　德重所期待之英·美侵歐登陸戰，終於展開，與此東西相呼應之太平洋戰局。除新幾內亞北部（以必阿克島方而爲中心）一帶之攻防戰外，僅有敵機之遊擊空襲，並無何新動向。在日軍嚴重哨戒之下，敵之蠢動隨時隨地悉被擊碎，敵機雖執拗來襲拉巴爾，所羅門·馬紹爾·特魯克等日軍基地，但各該地日軍守備隊則分別將敵機擊退，使受相當損失，日方則無甚大損失。例如敵B24型機七架。曾於七日來襲特魯克島，然因日戰鬥機採衝撞戰法，故敵機頓形狼狽，全失戰意，一方日機並在必阿克及瓦庫迭方面敵陣地及附近海面轟炸敵艦船，連日倍極活躍。即必阿克島方面，於三日炸毀敵運輸船二艘，使陸上設施兩處起火，擊落敵B25到機二架，四日夜炸炸沉毀敵巡洋艦各一艘，五日黎明炸沉巡洋艦，驅逐艦各一艘，八日黎明又炸毀敵運輪船二艘。瓦庫迭島方面於五日炸毀敵陸上機六十九架，並使敵機塡設施起火，繼之六日再炸敵機塲，使其發生大火，八日夜曾使敵機塲十六處發火，已予美軍重大打擊。今敵軍以菲律賓爲目標，自新幾內亞北岸西進，在必阿克，瓦庫迭一帶，衝擊日軍外廓防衛陣之一角，但此須作最大犧牲，故極感苦惱。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日機八日最在必阿克島海面發現敵艦船，當即襲擊之，擊傷敵運輪船二艘後，安然歸返基地。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　敵P44型機九架，八日來嬰米勒島，當地日軍擊落其一架，將之擊退。與此相前後，更與來襲之敵驅逐艦一艘展開炮戰，迫其遁走。</p>
<h3 id="c3">洞庭湖東岸　日軍佔領湘陰　先鋒隊已迫近長沙 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　重慶軍當局，於九日夜發表戰况如次：日軍已於長沙北方五公里之撈刀河渡河，現正向長沙城淮攻中，洞庭湖東岸之日軍部隊，刻已佔領湘陰。</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　渝方因日軍以破竹之勢進擊，似早知長沙難免失陷，於是最近曾大事宣傳謂，長沙之喪失，於整個戰鬥，並不發生影響。據重慶路透社電稱，日軍頃對防禦長沙之渝軍，正予以重大之打擊。惟據七日夜前綫消息，則謂長沙仍在渝軍手中。但據渝方發表戰况稱，日軍先鋒部隊已迫近長沙市西北九公里半强之地點，另一方面沿粵漢綫南下之日軍，亦已抵達該市北方十六公里之地點云。</p>
<p>日軍兩路進攻靈寶</p>
<p>河南前綫十日中央社電　日各部隊對隴海錢靈賓南方之敵第一戰區敗殘部隊，及自第八戰區調來之援軍約七萬，展開殲滅戰。自南方西進之第一綫日部隊，於六日晨抵達靈實南方，與第八戰區軍展開遭遇戰後，構成包圍綱，刻繼續進擊中。又自北方進擊之日部隊，刻進抵靈寶南方，與第八戰區軍展開激戰，日軍南北包圍綱次第壓縮中。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日糧食自給　態勢已完成 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本本年度馬鈴薯已至收穫時期，因今春風雨調和關係，預料收穫總數在四千萬担左右，與秋季馬鈴薯收獲，合計總數當在五千萬担以上。去年實數約四千萬祖，與今年相比較，今年增收約三成以上，則去年甘藉收穫約在一億担以上，與今年相比較，本年增收二成以上。由目下麥類，甘　類增收情况觀察，食糧自給自足態勢，現已完成。</p>
<h3 id="c5">鹽澤公使　視察河南前綫　政會王委長等偕行 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>北平十日中央社電　北平日大使館事務所鹽澤公使，七日與華北政委會王委長，岩松務委員會參議等，同赴河南新戰塲。除向前綫各部隊長致敬外，並感謝各將士之武勳，九日返抵北平云。</p>
<p>洛陽民衆紛紛來歸</p>
<p>洛陽十日中央社電　洛陽住民於今次河南作戰開始前，奉渝軍强制命令，九成以上皆行疎散。然迨日軍進駐未幾，竟有二萬五千餘名住民，悉數歸來，洛陽治安雜持會，目下除保障歸來民衆之生活外，更行積極建設新洛陽。連日積極修築破壞之這路，舊地下水道等，因此洛陽陷落後，僅於兩週內，面目即煥然一新。市內澡堂，理髪館，以及旅館等，均已先後相繼照常營業，已有紅男綠女出現街頭。現在洛陽物價，雖爲前年之四倍，但較去歲已減一成五至二成，民心安定，百廢俱興，至通貨情形，現下大半雖爲舊幣，然儲備券亦已逐漸流通市塲，且其信用極其昭著，故舊幣現已漸次收回，而充分顯出民衆誠心協力國府之情形。又洛陽於戰前，曾有七家報館，均先後停刋，故目前並無任何報道機關，一般民衆刻營翹首以待洛陽新報早日發刋云。</p>
<p>刧後鄭州秩序恢復</p>
<p>鄭州十日中央社電　日軍佔領鄭州茲已四十餘日，由於當地日軍施策之得當，及中國民衆積極協力，市面已日趨繁榮。據鄭州警察局調查，作戰開始前四萬市民，迄本月七日，業巳歸來三萬七千餘名。該警察局爲維持治安，協力建設，並實行保甲制度，特創設隣保組織二十四處，藉期市民自治。此外治安維持會建設課爲重新建設鄭州市街，現已組成建設隊數隊，先事修理市內各處被毀之房屋，市中之商店亦已全可開市，繁華街巷巳有少女踪跡，和平之氣氛，充滿街頭，市民之經濟生活，亦漸見安定。</p>
<h3 id="c6">滿駐華　使領會議閉幕　中滿國交愈臻密切 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>柏林十日中央社電　據前線消息：德軍沿岸炮兵，九日拂曉於柯坦汀半島之北部，發現欲從塞納灣登陸之反軸心艦船數百艘，當即發炮轟擊，經激戰後，該船團終不支潰走。</p>

<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊：自昨日起，巴猶與克恩間之坦克軍大會戰又趨激烈，敵以滑翔機及登陸艇自海空兩方面增援，再擴大攻勢之意，而德軍亦增援不已。塞納灣有成爲激戰中心之可能，克恩仍在德軍手中。巴猶位於克恩西北二十六公里處，兩地之間戰事最烈，敵坦克車隊繼續兩日前所發動之攻勢，俱爲德軍坦克車先鋒所阻，總軍繼起反攻，激戰又起，英傘兵降於德後備軍陣地阻其反攻，結果反爲德軍所殲滅。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　軍事方面發表：德軍常局認英美最高指揮部有獲得佔領包括瑟堡在內之柯坦汀半島之意圖，克恩及巴猶區戰事，乃系依比目標而進行。在星期四日及夜，美空輸部隊獲得大量增援，其中最重要者，乃美軍第九十步兵師團之到達是也，故在此區中最少有四大師團及一坦克車旅團，向西北對準瑟堡前進，同時更作保護其南面前綫之行動。</p>
<p>英境大軍等機出動</p>
<p>此外蒙高茂萊將軍更有二十師之衆，待機於英本土，故可推想於現存之橋頭堡獲得鞏固時，蒙氏將使其部衆渡海而至諾曼第作戰，故在此區可預期其有更多空輸部隊之降陸。英軍駐於安格里亞者尙未動用，或將於數日間用以開關侵犯戰之第二階級，倘此事一吿實現，則海峽區在鄧扣克及奧斯坦特之問，將有連合之行動。該處或將由加拿大特種師團及數個空輸師團，及大量之坦克車師團爲之，且艾森霍華將軍之麾下亦有五十個師團之衆，該軍之半數將用以進犯北法及比利時海岸者。</p>
<p>侵歐作戰先決條件</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德國進訊社訊：目下敵等最大之苦惱，即未能獲得較大海港。今後以橋頭堡爲基點，欲展開大規模之作戰時，則運送重武器，艦船所需停泊港灣有絕封必要，能否獲得海港，爲反軸心軍此次登陸作戰之成敗關鍵所繁，故敵現決以瑟堡及哈佛兩港爲進擊目標。由敵軍俘虜所持軍令及地圖，即可判知敵軍有奇襲佔領該兩港之計劃，然敵軍企圖完全失敗，迄侵入作戰之第四日夜，兩港仍在德軍掌握中。因此敵司令官艾森霍華不得不改變作戰計劃，敵雖仍有陸續派遺增援部隊之必要，但祗乏急于應用之海港。</p>

<p>團長訓詞</p>
<p>本團長在易地療養期間，我中央黨部之幹部同志，仍能恪逐本團長手訂之計劃，按期舉辦黨務工作人員訓練團。第一期成績頗爲圓滿，第二期又届結業之期，對於各地受訓同志，服從命令，不避艱險，按期到團報到。中央各位幹部同志，及中樞各位政治長官，分任訓練或講授，均能勤愼將事，始終如一，本團長深感欣慰。茲乘此舉行結業典禮之日，特對行將離團之諸問志，更勉數言：</p>
<p>要昂揚革命的情緖。訓練之最大意義，即爲策動精神上之總動員，亦即激發諸同志之革命情緖。諸同志敬仰本黨主義，獻身革命工作，革命情緖原極昂揚，惟以在各縣市或鄕村中工作，每以地方遼遠，或環境艱苦，歷時旣久，不免消沉，革命情　，亦因之未能盡量激發。此次來京受訓，精神上必多激厲，希望離團以後，仍能加倍昻揚革命的情緒，以奉行黨的工作，在全國各地方中，得以深入，得以普遏。</p>
<p>要負荷起時代的任務。自國府參加大東亞戰爭以來，國人稔聞英美之對我政治侵略經濟壓榨之事　矣，而不知對我民族上之歧視汚辱，尤爲吾人切齒所不忘。我國在此劃時代之過程中，內求全面和平之實現，外求大東亞戰爭勝利之完遂，最大任務，在求國家之平等，種族之平等。但自顧民智素淺，思想龐雜，故肅正全民之思想，　統一全民之力量，協力盟邦日本，實行同生共死，我本黨同志首應負荷起此時代之任務，以求中日同盟條約之實踐，以求大東亞宣言之人種平等的高尙理想之實現。恭繹我總理所倡導之大亞洲主義，亦即着重於中日向文同種之東亞種族，能自覺，能互助，能精　提携，能合力禦侮。在此決戰階段，尤應認　大東亞戰爭勝利之完遂，乃爲大東亞共榮圈建立之前提。凡我同志，亟應領導民衆，一致奮起，集中一切人力物力，貢獻於國家民族，以期歷史所賦予吾人之時代任務，以得迅速完成。</p>
<p>要努力着重本身工作。黨的主義，黨的政策，尤其是和平反共建國的政策，想諸同志早已耳熟能詳。但坐而言，不如起而行，所以要談黨的政策，先談黨的工作，欲談黨的工作，先看諸同志對本身工作是否努力。最近担任黨的下層工作的同志，動難以「環境不良，工作困難」爲言。須知革命的工作，原即艱難困苦的工作，原即在困難中而覓取辦法的工作。本圍長曾對軍官訓練團講過幾句話：「不怕死是勇，不怕難尤其是勇。」從前我在北京獄裏受不住苦，只念一句咒，這句咒是中國的將來，念了立刻就鎭定。現在本黨的强化正在研討具體方案之中，諸同志回到原服務的地方，要負起強化本黨的責任，堅持不怕難的精神，協同政府，領導民衆，肅淸匪共，增加生產。遇到艱難困苦工作，不能開展時，可以一念本黨之將來，中國之將來。認淸現實，突破難關，運用合理的技術，努力本身的工作，以期黨的强化從今日開始，從諸同志在各地方的工作中開始。</p>
<p>最後本團長尙有一言，即大東亞戰事勝利的基礎已奠定，大東亞戰事勝利的成果，仍得作最後最大之努力。復興中華，保衛東亞，是全中華民族的責任，尤其是我中國國民黨黨員的責任。大家在黨的領導下，負起責任來，建設一個三民主義的新中國。</p>

<p>吳縣特訊　江蘇省財政廳，近對吳縣賞熟等七縣施行房屋地價稅，限期申報，茲悉七縣人民以事變以後，民困尙未蘇息，不勝負擔，分呈行政院，財政部，江蘇省府及財政廳等請求暫緩施行。茲探錄原呈如次：</p>
<p>「呈爲刧後人民元氣未復，環懇俯施令飭蘇省財政當局暫緩施行地價稅，以紓民力事。伏續江蘇省財政廳通吿施行吳縣·常熟·崑山·無錫·武進·鎭江·松江等七縣房屋地價稅，限期申報等因。謹按地價稅係屬國策，根據於國父建國大綱，人民義務所在，不敢稍有異議。惟今非其時，吾蘇省吳縣常熟等七縣人民自經事變之後，民力凋殘，瘡痍未復，就表面觀察，似乎一部份城鎭漸復舊觀，然而外强中乾，畸形發展，繁榮愈甚，物價愈高，小民困苦亦愈甚。論其財力民力，與首都南京及北京等處並無二致，我中央政府鑒於刧後人民難勝重負，是以北京南京等處，尙未施行地價稅，非敢後也，實不忍重苦吾民也。吳縣常熟等七縣，同隸帡幪，似應一視同仁，俟民力眞正恢復，然後再談施行地價稅，此應請暫緩者一也。議一步言，微聞此次殊省財政廳施行地價稅，估計價格，按照目前市價提高一倍以上，竭澤而漁，專爲收入方面着想，殊不思現在物價騰漲不已，政府方且種種設法竭力抑平，甚至有抑平物價委員會之組織，雖未獲寸效，然而人民固同感政府　念民瘼之德矣。今乃以高漲之物價，作爲稅額之標準，是不啻獎勵物價之高漲，而與民爭利矣，此應暫緩者二也。伏念鈞院曾有通令，凡增加人民負擔之捐稅，均須事先呈請核准，仰見軫念民瘼防微杜漸之至意，莫名感頌。爲此合詞籲懇均院俯念吳縣等七縣民困尙未蘇息，飭令蘇省政府暫緩施行房屋地價稅，以蘇民困，不勝屏營待命之至。謹呈行政院</p>

<h3 id="c35">崑山縣米糧收買實況　政治機構與收買方法比須刷新 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>大睦新報竹本特派員最近赴崑山。太倉等地實地糧米糧收買情形，為該報撰述通訊。對於米糧收買實况，及各方意見。報道甚詳，本報特為鐘　於後，以供讀者參考。</p>
<p>關於崑山縣米糧收買的各問題，記者曾盡可能加以調查，茲綜合各方面的意見如左：</p>
<p>一·米統會的機構及工作應速即料芷內地中心主義，充分發揮適應各地區特殊情形的機動性。</p>
<p>二·排除內地收買機稱多元的弱體化，確立一元的強力體，殊情形的激動性。</p>
<p>三·不但不胡列從農民收買，並重視向農民配給；促進收買所必要的物資，特別是肥料等，應由收買機關一元地計畫地配</p>
<p>四·收買時發表的所謂「適當價格」，縱然和巿價同樣高，但隨收買的進展，巿　必高翔其上；因有這種不可避免的傾向，對於收買價格發表的方法與時期，應重新加以深刻的五考·貨及全部物價的安定為收買成功的第一義的條件，如不具備這個買政策，結果必將招致與低價政策同樣的失敗。</p>
<p>六·無論採取行政收買也好，實行自由收買也好，政治力·軍事力·收買力三位一體的協力是絕對必要的，政治機構及收買方法必須全面刷新，俾得促進如此的協力。</p>
<p>以上不過是抽象的結論，所以有將歸納出這種結論的具體的實際情形詳細報吿一下的必要，茲將調查的結果用一問一答的形式發表出來，庶可由此明白崑山縣米糧收買的實際情形。</p>
<p>米糧收買實相</p>
<p>問　崑山米統會辦事處採辦同業公會　備委員會及×××買辦商社的現狀如何？</p>
<p>答　崑山辦事處管轄崑山太倉兩縣。米糧採辦同業公會籌備委員計崑山十七家，太倉五家，合計二十二家。×××在崑山有×××。××·××洋行，太倉則僅有××洋行。負責買辦數量，大體爲中×同量（華方稱多），但實際購買數量則華方不及×方二分之一。目下上海及各團體主張廢止各地區辦事處，並整理指定採辦商等。對此有何意見？</p>
<p>答　米統會各地區下部機稱非澈底改革不可，自不待言，但若主張祇存米統會本部而撤消其下部機構，則等於斬去手足僅今首幹生存。如若根本廢除米統會，則作別論，茍欲令其存在而負責收買特需米，則遵其指揮命令而動的强力的下部機構極為必要，恐無議論的餘地。總之，必耍的事情是在各收買地組織以中×優秀採辦商構成的一元的手買統制機構。例如×方的收買機構，現有買辦組合，×××及十三轉包商社，其指揮命令系統極複雜化多元化，在為米糧收買第一綫的各地區，並無一元化的買辦組合。至於中國方面，指定採辦商雖然名爲同業公會籌備委員會，而實際上則各自爲政，卽非同業公會，也不是其籌備會。所以各行號應放棄小的倆人的立場，站在大的一元性通知機關的立場上，向一絲不素的收買活動之途邁進。而最希望的事就是凡關於各該地區的米糧收買。對於資金。價格·人事·收買·物資配給等，應於一定的範團內將最大的權限賦與逍種一元性收買機關。</p>
<p>問　聽說辦事處和採辦同業公會籌備委員頗多缺陷。</p>
<p>答　辦事處的人事以上海的意志為主而決定，而收買地行號的眞代表者不參加時，便是祇在形式上整備了和上海的縱的關係關係）。再則，籌備員中簡直沒有歷史悠久的當地老米行參加，籌備員大多數是居住上海等地的，甚至在開重要會議時亦常缺席；這是實情。</p>
<p>問　如果修正收買價格，則如所謂「水向低流」，米會整渠起來嗎？</p>
<p>答　現在是極緊急的時期。此地恐怕沒有一個人酖於這樣便當不負責的想法。上月百元可買的東西本月非二百元莫辦，這種貨幣價値的一般性不安定若不設法糾正，則今後的收買依然是困難的。由於物重於紙幣的思想，囤積一兩年食米的人，在各地相當多，他們恐怕不會單因高價收買政策而出籠的。此外，發表價格這一舉動，其本身也有促便米飯上漲的作用，此　非　匯朧朧不可。</p>
<p>問　責成　眞數量與實際採辦數軍之間何故相　甚巨？</p>
<p>問　崑山縣的米糧生產額約為組米一百五十萬石，基於蘇省政約的指示，實成講買量其五五％，而着通的塲合，收買可能的限度為二〇％乃至二〇%左右，所以目標量可說自始即已非常欠妥，何况去年度巳滅產二成乃至三成。但本縣治安旣屬良好，旦為江蘇省的模範縣，於稻未熟時即已擬定收買計劃，並有由獎勵代用食而糾正消費等以期確保最大最的計劃。不過米統會辦事處於十一月成立，自十一月下旬起才開始收買，爲時已嫌過　，所以上面的計劃也不能實施，加以市價　貴，因而遭決定絕對能實行的目標量，則對農民或有良好的思想上的影響亦未可知。</p>
<p>問　崑山縣內是採用行政收買，自由收買抑取行政自由併用收買的？</p>
<p>答　供出制皮是一律的。目標本決定實行每畝一石的行政收買（一畝可得二石者頗少），但例如本縣第五區，很多地方一畝祇產八斗，對於這些也一律是一石，所以農民到底不能照供出的指令辦，成績自然不會好。就全體而論，旣然採取了供出制，則定中×行號間的地區比例，自屬必要。在米統會方面，原則上雖巳撤廢地區比例例制，但在崑山縣為使供出確實，防止自由競爭起見，對於各行號寗行地區比例，此是根據中×行號的協定的</p>
<p>問　米統會交付的收買資金沒有惡月的傾向嗎？</p>
<p>答　米統會對於指定收買商的貸款，單祇華方，到三月十日止約四千三百七十萬元，三月十一日起到四月底止約二千四百七十萬元，五月中約三百三十萬元，合計達七千一百七十萬元之巨。這些巨額的資金用於何處，可有種種想像。至於××方面的商社，鑒於三十一年度承攬掮客惡用定洋的經騐，盡可能避免採用前年的方法，所以弊端大减。</p>
<p>問　米統會前曾使用五種日用品作為交換物資，那些東西果巳配給農民了嗎？</p>
<p>答　今年因巳昧取防止中飽的對策，相信大部分巳查接落入農民手中了千元搭付配給品二百元但一千元的米，以升斗而論，合起來約一石六斗，所以在物資配給的計算上非常麻煩。即每一石六斗配給肥皂〇·二運，火柴一·二小盒，砂糖三兩，這在計算者和受取者都很討厭。又如棉布，農民說三。五碼不夠做衣服。因爲農民大體供出三石光量，所以不過得到白劵兩張左右的配給，如再細細分配各種物資，手續是太麻煩了。希望不要一千元對二百元這樣以來統會方面的計算使利爲主，而　到農民及收實者方面的便利。決定每石配給若干才好。這確是很小的一點。但於此正有其工作的根本意義存在。五種交換品在緩和農民的感情上或可發生作用，但由此未必可以促進收買。配給最有效的是硫安。其配給雖由合作社經手，但收買與配給有盡可能一元地計畫的必要。</p>
<p>問　對於京滬方面的希望如何？</p>
<p>答　像去年那樣機稱的改革延至十一月末才實行。以致錯過了收買良機的事情，希望今年不要重演。即使現在就確立對於決不會太早的。目下上海方面巿政府，諸詢會，米統會等等對於周　薇購問題正很起勁，但望不要因方針，早早從事收買，在舊正以前完成所期的效果，為了以後實行自由收買起見，確立收買原則，並迅速實踐云。（吉譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Weekly Commentary: The Scholar-Official <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhengping</p>
<p>Since the entire world fell into a state of war, transportation has been destroyed, materials are scarce, and with various man-made factors, commodity prices have soared without end. The lives of the general populace have fallen into a state of panic and hardship, especially the salaried class. Among the salaried class, cultural figures and central political workers are the worst affected. Our country has always been accustomed to considering being an official as glorious and scholars as noble. Now, both of these groups are gradually developing resentment due to the pressure of life. This is truly a serious crisis at the root of the nation and should be promptly remedied.</p>
<p>Once a nation is formed, it cannot be without politics. Once there is politics, there cannot be a lack of political personnel. Where do political personnel come from? According to our national character, they come from scholars. Therefore, the character "shi" [士 - scholar/official] means both learning and serving as an official. The meaning of "huan" [宦 - official] can also be understood as an official-student. Learning and serving as an official, that is, scholars and being an official, are fundamentally linked and cannot be separated. Therefore, Confucius also had the saying, "Study well and then serve as an official; serve well as an official and then study." Examining historical facts, for thousands of years, in any era, all the officials in the country have been drawn from scholars. This was the case during the implementation of the election system (different from modern so-called elections), and it is also the case during the implementation of the examination system, and it is also the case during the modern implementation of the school system. In short, the scholars in the study rooms across the country are all the predecessors of the officials in the central and provincial governments, and none of the officials in the central and provincial governments cannot be scholars in the study rooms. The three characters "shi da fu" [士大夫 - scholar-official] form a fixed noun. The relationship between scholars and officials is so close, like a mother giving birth to a child. Therefore, in the national history, the eras hailed as prosperous times for the nation all focused on the cultivation of scholars. In eras where scholars were neglected and even culture was swept away, such as the period of the Five Dynasties, it reflected the darkness and decline of that time. Today's China, although under the shadow of war, still holds the great aspiration of building a new China and revitalizing a new China, which is the call of the times. However, scholars and civil servants alike, due to the pressure of life, despise their precious mission. The turbulent waves are surging, and the rivers are declining. The result will be that there will be no culture, no politics, and no nation to speak of. What construction and revitalization can there be? Is this not the most serious fundamental crisis for the nation?</p>
<p>In national history, no period respected scholars more than the Song Dynasty. Emperor Taizu of Song even listed the rule of not killing scholar-officials as one of his last testaments, which was engraved on a stone lock, placed in the palace hall, and ordered future emperors to kneel and read. The result was the formation of a period of extremely flourishing academic thought after the Spring and Autumn period, and the shining of loyal ministers and righteous men at the end of the Song Dynasty also showcased the great glory of our nation. Historians call it the clear effect of respecting scholar-officials in the early days of the founding of the country. However, Wang Anshi, a great statesman of the Song Dynasty, still keenly advocated the importance of improving the nurturing of scholars. In his memorial to Emperor Renzong, he said:</p>
<p>"Currently, the salaries are generally low. Unless they are in the ranks of the court attendants, most people with families to support cannot afford to live by their salaries alone and must also engage in agriculture and commerce. As for the officials in the lower prefectures and counties, their monthly income is at most eight or nine thousand coins, and at least four or five thousand coins. They have to wait for selection, appointment, or vacancy, and it takes six or seven years to receive three years' worth of salary. In reality, their monthly income is not even four or five thousand coins, and at least not even three or four thousand coins. Even the servants' wages are insufficient, and they must also cover the costs of raising children, funerals, marriages, and burials. Those who are above average, though poor, do not lose their status as gentlemen. Those who are below average, though wealthy, do not lose their status as petty men. Only those in the middle are different. When poor, they become petty men; when wealthy, they become gentlemen. Counting the scholars in the world, those who are above or below average are less than one in a hundred. Those who become petty men when poor and gentlemen when wealthy are the majority in the world. The ancient kings believed that the masses could not be overcome by force, so they set rules not based on their own desires but based on the average person's ability to follow, so as to benefit them according to their desires. If the rules are what the average person can abide by, then their ambitions can be implemented throughout the world and passed on to future generations. With the current salary system, wanting scholars not to abandon integrity and shame is something that even the average person cannot do. Therefore, high-ranking officials often engage in bribery and accumulate wealth, bearing the stigma of corruption. Low-ranking officials engage in peddling and begging, doing everything possible. Once a scholar has abandoned integrity and shame and become a burden to the world, their intention to be lazy and seek favor arises, and their heart of diligence and self-improvement ceases. Then how can their duties not be neglected, and how can good governance arise? Moreover, those who violate the law and accept bribes, encroaching on the people, are everywhere. This is what is meant by not being able to enrich them with wealth."</p>
<p>Wang Anshi's argument is a section on cultivating talents. Although it was aimed at the Song Dynasty, it can also be said to be aimed at the present. His words, "Even the servants are struggling," are especially a complete portrayal of the present situation. Our government authorities are determined to revive and build a new China. Regarding the matter of righteous scholars, which is the fundamental lifeline of the nation, no matter how difficult the environment, we must take Wang Anshi's heart as our own and find ways to remedy the malpractices that Wang Anshi pointed out. This is not for the sake of the individual cultural figures and civil servants, but a major plan for correcting the source and purifying the roots of national politics. Without this, how can we establish politics? Leaving aside other things, just look at the administrative efficiency of our country's postal and customs agencies. Because there are special provisions regarding seniority-based salary increases, pensions, and retirement benefits, which are different from ordinary administrative agencies, these civil servants were known for their dedication and diligence before the incident, and they did not easily change their minds. Their administrative efficiency was remarkable. Furthermore, looking at the treatment of Japanese civil servants (teachers in universities and schools of all levels are a type of civil servant), there are clear provisions regarding seniority-based salary increases, pensions, and retirement benefits, which are completely similar to our country's postal agencies. Therefore, those who serve the public can also work with peace of mind, and their administrative efficiency is remarkable. If our country wants to revive, it must rely on many scholars who either focus on research (university professors are not only teachers but also engage in their own research) or strive to serve the public. If those who are called scholar-officials are constantly worried about their livelihood, the result will inevitably be that the majority of the people lose their souls, and the majority of institutions become mere formalities. In short, it is that there is no learning below and no politics above. Therefore, given how high commodity prices are and how difficult finances are, only these scholar-officials, who are the foundation of the nation, must at least look back to the national character of thousands of years and consider the general rules of China and foreign countries to establish a fundamental plan to protect their livelihoods, so as to avoid becoming victims of the war era. I believe that government authorities from scholar-official backgrounds will surely have sympathy for this.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the scholar-officials themselves, they should also take advantage of this difficult period to demonstrate the true value of their leadership among the masses. Where does this true value lie? It lies in the spirit of contentment with poverty and delight in the Way. Mencius said that if the people have no permanent property, they will have no constant heart. Without a constant heart, they will do everything that is depraved and extravagant. This is completely the same tone as what Guanzi said: "When the granary is full, they will know etiquette; when they have enough to eat and wear, they will know honor and shame." However, Mencius made an exception for scholars, saying that only scholars can have a constant heart without permanent property. This so-called scholar can of course be applied to scholar-officials. Extending this, it means that scholars still know etiquette even if the granary is empty, and scholars still know honor and shame even if they do not have enough to eat and wear. Therefore, Confucius also said, "The gentleman is firm in poverty, but the petty man is reckless in poverty." Mencius further established the distinction between the heavenly nobility and the human nobility to encourage scholar-officials to diligently pursue benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, and tireless good deeds, and to encourage scholar-officials to uphold their ideal personality of being incorruptible by wealth and unyielding by poverty. If our scholar-officials consider themselves to be the foundation of the nation, that today's scholars are tomorrow's officials, and today's officials are tomorrow's scholars, and further contemplate the saintly attitude of not changing their joy with a simple meal and a gourd of water, and further contemplate that the personality of scholars is different from ordinary people, that ordinary people are mostly enslaved by their physical desires, but that scholars can control material things with their spirit and transcendently maintain their nature of being tireless in learning and teaching and not being jealous or demanding, so as to resist the turbid currents of the times, just as Mencius said in the chapter "Heaven will entrust great responsibility to this person, and must first afflict his heart and will, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body and skin, and empty his body," then all the various pressures of life they receive today are all touchstones for tempering us and all opportunities for showing the true value of scholar-officials. The future of the nation and the people will be entrusted to this. What poverty is there to worry about? This is also what I hope for from the so-called scholar-officials.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Under Strict Patrol by Japanese Troops: No New Developments in the Pacific; Japanese Forces Damage Two Enemy Ships off Biak <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Anglo-American landing operation in Europe, which Germany greatly anticipated, has finally begun. Corresponding to this on the Eastern front is the Pacific war situation. Apart from the battle for and against the northern part of New Guinea (centered on Biak Island), there have only been hit-and-run air raids by enemy aircraft, with no new developments. Under strict patrol by Japanese troops, enemy movements are crushed anytime and anywhere. Although enemy aircraft stubbornly attack Japanese bases such as Rabaul, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, and Truk, the Japanese garrison forces in each of these locations have repelled the enemy aircraft, causing them considerable losses, while the Japanese side has suffered little damage. For example, seven enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the 7th. However, because Japanese fighters adopted ramming tactics, the enemy aircraft were immediately thrown into confusion and lost all will to fight. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft have been actively bombing enemy positions and nearby waters in the Biak and Wakde areas for days. In the Biak Island area, two enemy transport ships were destroyed on the 3rd, causing two onshore facilities to catch fire, and two enemy B-25 aircraft were shot down. On the night of the 4th, one enemy cruiser was bombed and sunk, and one was damaged. At dawn on the 5th, one cruiser and one destroyer were bombed and sunk. At dawn on the 8th, two more enemy transport ships were bombed and destroyed. In the Wakde Island area, 69 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the 5th, and enemy aircraft fueling facilities were set on fire. Subsequently, on the 6th, the enemy airfield was bombed again, causing a large fire. On the night of the 8th, fires were set at 16 enemy airfield locations, inflicting a major blow on the American forces. Now, with the Philippines as their target, the enemy is advancing westward from the north coast of New Guinea, impacting a corner of the Japanese outer defense line in the Biak and Wakde areas, but this requires the greatest sacrifice, so they are extremely distressed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — On the 8th, Japanese aircraft discovered enemy ships on the sea off Biak Island and immediately attacked them, damaging two enemy transport ships before safely returning to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — Nine enemy P-44 aircraft came to Emidj Island on the 8th. The local Japanese forces shot down one of them and repelled the others. Around the same time, they also engaged in a cannon battle with an enemy destroyer that came to attack, forcing it to flee.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops Occupy Xiangyin on the East Bank of Dongting Lake; Vanguard Force Approaching Changsha <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation on the night of the 9th as follows: Japanese troops have crossed the Laodao River, five kilometers north of Changsha, and are currently attacking Changsha. Japanese troops on the east bank of Dongting Lake have now occupied Xiangyin.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) — Because the Japanese troops are advancing with unstoppable momentum, the Chongqing side seems to have known for some time that Changsha would inevitably fall. Therefore, they have recently been heavily promoting that the loss of Changsha will not affect the overall battle. According to a Reuters report from Chongqing, the Japanese troops are currently inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing troops defending Changsha. However, according to news from the front line on the night of the 7th, Changsha is still in the hands of the Chongqing troops. But according to the Chongqing side's announcement of the battle situation, the vanguard force of the Japanese troops has approached a location about 9.5 kilometers northwest of Changsha City. On the other hand, the Japanese troops advancing south along the Yuehan Railway have also reached a location 16 kilometers north of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Troops Launch Two-Pronged Attack on Lingbao <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Henan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) — Various Japanese units are launching an annihilation campaign against approximately 70,000 defeated and remnants of the First War Area south of Lingbao on the Longhai Line and reinforcements transferred from the Eighth War Area. The first-line Japanese troops advancing westward from the south reached south of Lingshi on the morning of the 6th. After engaging in an encounter battle with the Eighth War Area troops, they formed an encirclement and are continuing their advance. Also, the Japanese troops advancing from the north are advancing to the south of Lingbao and are engaging in fierce battles with the Eighth War Area troops. The north-south encirclement of the Japanese troops is gradually tightening.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japan's Food Self-Sufficiency Posture Completed <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — Japan's potato harvest season has arrived this year. Due to favorable weather conditions this spring, the total harvest is expected to be around 40 million dan, which, combined with the autumn potato harvest, will total more than 50 million dan. Last year's actual number was about 40 million dan. Compared with this year, this year's increase is about 30% or more. Last year's sweet potato harvest was about 100 million dan or more. Compared with this year, this year's increase is more than 20%. Judging from the current situation of increased wheat and sweet potato production, the food self-sufficiency posture has now been completed.</p>

<h3 id="e7">People of Luoyang Return in Droves <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang, 10th (Central News Agency) — Before the start of the current Henan operation, more than 90% of Luoyang residents were evacuated under the compulsory orders of the Chongqing army. However, after the Japanese troops moved in, more than 25,000 residents returned. In addition to ensuring the livelihood of the returning people, the Luoyang Public Order Maintenance Association is now actively building a new Luoyang. It is actively repairing the damaged roads and old underground waterways. Therefore, Luoyang's appearance has been completely renewed within only two weeks after its fall. Public bathhouses, barber shops, and hotels have all resumed business one after another, and young men and women have appeared on the streets. Although prices in Luoyang are now four times higher than the year before last, they have decreased by 15% to 20% compared to last year. The people's hearts are stable, and all undertakings are flourishing. As for the currency situation, although most of it is still old currency, reserve notes have gradually been circulating in the market, and their credibility is extremely evident. Therefore, old currency is now being gradually withdrawn, fully demonstrating the people's sincere cooperation with the national government. Also, before the war, Luoyang had seven newspapers, all of which have stopped publication. Therefore, there is currently no news agency, and the general public is eagerly awaiting the early publication of the Luoyang New Report.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Large Tank Battle Unfolds Northwest of Caen; Both Sides Continuously Reinforcing <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The United Press reports: Since yesterday, the large tank battle between Bayeux and Caen has intensified again. The enemy is reinforcing from both the sea and the air with gliders and landing craft, intending to expand their offensive. German forces are also continuously reinforcing. Seine Bay may become the center of fierce fighting. Caen remains in German hands. Bayeux is located 26 kilometers northwest of Caen, and the fighting between the two places is the fiercest. The enemy tank columns continue the offensive launched two days ago, but are blocked by the vanguard of German tanks. The main force then launched a counter-attack, and fierce fighting broke out again. British paratroopers landed in the rear of German reserves to hinder their counter-attack, but were annihilated by German forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Military sources announced: German authorities believe that the Anglo-American high command intends to seize the Cotentin Peninsula, including Cherbourg. The fighting in the Caen and Bayeux areas is proceeding according to this objective. On Thursday, the American airborne troops received significant reinforcements, the most important of which was the arrival of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division. Therefore, in this area, there are at least four divisions and one tank brigade advancing northwest towards Cherbourg, while also taking action to protect their southern front.</p>
<p>British Army Stands Ready to Deploy</p>
<p>Furthermore, General Montgomery has 20 divisions standing by in the British Isles. Therefore, it can be inferred that when the existing bridgehead is consolidated, Montgomery will send his troops across the sea to Normandy to fight. Thus, more airborne troops can be expected to land in this area. British forces stationed in Angria have not yet been deployed and may be used in the second stage of the invasion in the coming days. If this happens, there will be a joint operation in the strait area between Dunkirk and Ostend. This area may be targeted by Canadian special divisions, several airborne divisions, and a large number of tank divisions. General Eisenhower also has 50 divisions under his command, half of which will be used to invade northern France and the Belgian coast.</p>
<p>Prerequisites for the Invasion of Europe</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German News Agency reports: The enemy's biggest problem at the moment is the failure to secure a larger port. In the future, to launch large-scale operations from the bridgehead, it is absolutely necessary to have a port to transport heavy weapons and to berth ships. Whether a port can be secured is crucial to the success or failure of the anti-Axis landing operation. Therefore, the enemy has now determined to target the ports of Cherbourg and Le Havre for attack. Military orders and maps held by enemy prisoners indicate that the enemy plans to seize the two ports by surprise. However, the enemy's attempt completely failed. By the fourth night of the invasion operation, both ports were still in German hands. Therefore, the enemy commander Eisenhower has had to change the operational plan. Although the enemy still needs to continuously send reinforcements, they lack a port for urgent use.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Occurs on the Dutch Coast</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German News Agency reports, according to the German Navy: Between 2:00 and 3:00 AM this morning, German patrol boats and British torpedo boats engaged in fierce fighting near Midden on the Dutch coast. Several enemy boats were hit, and one was severely damaged.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The United Press reports from Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King, and Commanding General of the Army Air Forces General Arnold have all arrived in London to attend a joint chiefs of staff meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e14">President Amau Delivers Speech, Analyzing the European War Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The second general meeting of the Japanese Speech Patriotic Society was held grandly here on the 10th. President Amau of the Japanese Information Bureau personally attended and delivered a speech, analyzing the invasion of Europe, expressing confidence in victory, and criticizing the ambitions of Britain and the United States in detail. The main points are as follows: The war is now becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is facing complex and subtle problems in opening up domestic and foreign relations. At the same time, from a purely military perspective, the enemy needs to end the war as soon as possible in terms of politics, diplomacy, and economics. Therefore, the enemy is launching counter-offensives everywhere in East Asia. Coordinating with this, they began an invasion of continental Europe several days ago. Germany has been fully prepared for this, as the German authorities announced, "The good opportunity that Germany has been waiting for has finally arrived." We are confident that the German army will make the enemy replay its defeat at Dunkirk and Dieppe. There have been many wars in world history, but none have been like this one. The truth and falsehood are so obvious, and the ambitions of Britain and the United States are so blatantly revealed. Britain waged war against Germany in the name of protecting small nations, but now it has abandoned the position of the small nations themselves and entrusted their fate to major powers. In order to expand their territory, Britain and the United States have had to change and revise the war aims they proclaimed at the beginning of the war and revise the so-called Atlantic Charter. Therefore, in recent days, Britain and the United States have stated that the primary goal of the war is to achieve military victory first, followed by the construction of a new world. It is worth noting that the primary goal of the British and American war is to achieve military victory. However, in order to achieve victory, they will use any means necessary, regardless of the method. For example, Britain and the United States consider bombing hospitals, cultural buildings, and temple facilities as humane behavior in disregard of international law. Since the beginning of the war, there have been countless such facts. The British and Americans use aircraft to massacre people in enemy countries, with no morality or law to speak of. However, it is incomprehensible whether the world today is mechanically destroying morality or morality is controlling machines. Furthermore, Britain and the United States also claim that the ultimate goal of the war is to "build a world of good." However, this so-called world of good is one in which money dominates humanity and materialism dominates morality. Today's East Asia is by no means the East Asia of the past. Japan and all the nations of East Asia have now risen up. Therefore, in order to control East Asia, Britain and the United States must first subdue Japan before launching this great war. Japan, on the other hand, is fighting for self-preservation, self-defense, and on the basis of morality, to build Greater East Asia, and even to establish a new world order. Its purpose has been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration last year: "Coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, cultural advancement, economic prosperity, and contributing to world peace." Our righteousness is upright, and we are progressing steadily. The recent Japanese army's attack on Luoyang, at the cost of enduring various operational difficulties in order to preserve ancient culture, is a clear example.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The second class of trainees from the Central Party Affairs Workers Training Corps held a graduation ceremony on the 10th, presided over by Chen Gongbo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, representing the Corps Commander. In attendance were Standing Committee members Lin Baisheng, Ren Yuandao, Bao Wenyue, Yu Shuxuan, Ye Peng, Xu Suzhou, and over a hundred trainees. The Chief Captain Gao delivered a report, stating that there were ninety-nine graduating trainees. At the beginning of the ceremony, the Dean Dai reported on the training process. The trainees respectfully presented the Corps Commander with a banner reading "Long Live the Leader." Standing Committee Member Chen read the Corps Commander's address and presented graduation certificates and awards on behalf of the Corps Commander. All trainees took an oath and sang the Corps song. The graduation ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Corps Commander's Address</p>
<p>While the Corps Commander is recuperating in another location, the comrades of our Central Party Department have still been able to faithfully implement the plans set by the Corps Commander and hold the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps on schedule. The first class had quite satisfactory results, and the second class has now reached the graduation stage. The Corps Commander is deeply gratified that the comrades from various places who received training obeyed orders, did not avoid hardships, and reported to the Corps on schedule. The Central Committee comrades and the central political leaders have all diligently and conscientiously carried out their training and lectures, from beginning to end. On this day of the graduation ceremony, I would like to offer some words of encouragement to those who are about to leave the Corps:</p>
<p>First, it is essential to uplift revolutionary emotions. The greatest significance of training is to mobilize the spirit, that is, to stimulate the revolutionary emotions of the comrades. The comrades admire the Party's principles and devote themselves to revolutionary work, and their revolutionary emotions are originally very high. However, working in various counties and villages, often in remote places or in harsh environments, can lead to discouragement over time, and the revolutionary emotions may not be fully stimulated. This training in Beijing must have been spiritually invigorating. I hope that after leaving the Corps, you will continue to redouble your efforts to uplift revolutionary emotions to carry out the Party's work so that it can penetrate deeply and become widespread throughout the country.</p>
<p>Second, it is essential to shoulder the mission of the times. Since the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people have learned about the political aggression and economic exploitation of Britain and the United States against us. However, the discrimination and humiliation against our nation are particularly unforgettable. In this epoch-making process, our country seeks to realize comprehensive peace internally and to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War externally. The greatest mission is to seek equality for the nation and equality for the race. However, the people's intelligence is shallow, and their thoughts are complex. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the thinking of the entire people, unify the strength of the entire people, and cooperate with the Allied Japan to carry out shared existence and shared death. Comrades of our Party should first shoulder this mission of the times to achieve the practice of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and to realize the noble ideal of racial equality in the Greater East Asia Declaration. The Great Asianism advocated by our Premier emphasizes that the East Asian races, who share the same script and the same ethnicity, can be self-aware, can help each other, can sincerely cooperate, and can unite to resist aggression. In this decisive stage, it is particularly important to recognize that the completion of the victory of the Greater East Asia War is a prerequisite for the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. All our comrades should urgently lead the people to rise up together, concentrate all manpower and material resources, and contribute to the country and the nation, so that the mission of the times entrusted to us by history can be completed quickly.</p>
<p>Third, it is essential to strive to focus on one's own work. The Party's principles, the Party's policies, especially the policies of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, are something that all comrades have long been familiar with. However, it is better to take action than to just talk about it. So, to talk about the Party's policies, first talk about the Party's work. To talk about the Party's work, first see if the comrades are working hard in their own work. Recently, comrades who are in charge of the Party's grassroots work often say, "The environment is bad, and the work is difficult." It must be known that revolutionary work is originally a difficult and arduous work, and it is a work of finding solutions in difficulties. This Corps Commander once said a few words to the officers' training corps: "Not being afraid of death is courage, but not being afraid of difficulty is especially courageous." In the past, when I could not bear the suffering in the Beijing prison, I only recited a mantra, and that mantra was the future of China. Reciting it immediately calmed me down. Now, the strengthening of our Party is under discussion with concrete plans. Comrades, when you return to the place where you originally served, you must take on the responsibility of strengthening our Party, adhere to the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, cooperate with the government, lead the people, eliminate the bandits and communists, and increase production. When you encounter difficult and arduous work that cannot be developed, you can recite the future of our Party and the future of China. Recognize reality, overcome difficulties, use reasonable techniques, and strive for your own work, so that the strengthening of the Party can begin today, from the work of the comrades in various places.</p>
<p>Finally, this Corps Commander has one more thing to say, that is, the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War has been laid, and the fruits of the victory of the Greater East Asia War still require the final and greatest effort. Reviving China and protecting East Asia is the responsibility of the entire Chinese nation, especially the responsibility of the members of our Chinese Nationalist Party. Under the leadership of the Party, everyone should take on the responsibility and build a new China of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<h3 id="e18">People of Seven Counties Appeal for Postponement of Land Value Tax <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Wuxian Special Dispatch - The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance recently implemented a land value tax in seven counties including Wuxian and Changshu, setting a deadline for declaration. It is learned that the people of the seven counties, feeling that they cannot bear the burden due to the unrecovered livelihood of the people after the incident, have submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Department of Finance, requesting a postponement of implementation. The original petition is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"Petition for the recovery of the people's vitality after the calamity. We earnestly request that you order the Jiangsu Provincial financial authorities to postpone the implementation of the land value tax to relieve the people's strength. According to the notice issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, the land value tax will be implemented in seven counties including Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, Zhenjiang, and Songjiang, with a deadline for declaration, etc. It is hereby stated that the land value tax is a national policy, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Construction, and the people's duty lies in it, so we dare not have any objection. However, now is not the time. The people of the seven counties of Wuxian, Changshu, etc. in our Jiangsu Province have suffered devastation and have not yet recovered from the calamity since the incident. Judging from the surface, it seems that some cities and towns are gradually returning to their former appearance, but they are strong on the outside and weak on the inside, with distorted development. The more prosperous, the higher the prices, and the more difficult the lives of the common people. In terms of financial and public strength, there is no difference from the capital Nanjing and Beijing. Considering that the people after the calamity can hardly bear the burden, our Central Government has not yet implemented the land value tax in places such as Beijing and Nanjing. It is not that we dare to lag behind, but that we cannot bear to burden our people. The seven counties of Wuxian, Changshu, etc. are all under the same jurisdiction, and should be treated equally. We should wait until the public strength has truly recovered before discussing the implementation of the land value tax. This is the first reason why we should request a postponement. To speak further, we have heard that this special provincial Department of Finance is implementing the land value tax, estimating the prices according to the current market prices, which have been increased by more than double. Exhausting the pond to catch the fish, it is solely for the sake of income, without considering that prices are soaring endlessly, and the government is even trying every means to suppress them. There is even an organization of a Committee to Suppress Prices, although it has not achieved any results, the people still feel the government's compassion for their hardships. Now, the soaring prices are used as the standard for the tax amount, which is tantamount to encouraging the soaring prices and competing with the people for profits. This is the second reason why we should request a postponement. We believe that the Executive Yuan has a general order that all taxes that increase the burden on the people must be submitted for approval in advance. We admire the Executive Yuan's utmost care for the hardships of the people and its vigilance against the slightest sign of trouble. Therefore, we jointly appeal to the Executive Yuan to consider that the people of the seven counties of Wuxian, etc. have not yet recovered from their hardships, and order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to postpone the implementation of the land value tax for houses in order to alleviate the people's hardships. We are in a state of anxiety awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan."</p>

<p>Recently, the price of rice has soared in our city, and the poor have been most severely affected. The city government, considering that most poor people rely on pancakes to fill their stomachs, has ordered the responsible authorities to plan for rationing in this regard to provide relief. It is learned that the responsible parties have decided to ration a large quantity of flour to major pancake shops after several consultations with relevant parties. The total amount of flour is expected to be about 5,000 bags, which will be distributed to pancake shops throughout the city at an average price. During this period of rice shortage, this supplementation should be able to slightly alleviate the hardships of the people. The Grain Bureau and the Economic Office of the First District have already ordered major pancake shops to register for acceptance, and it can be implemented around mid-month.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the various biscuit factories and major restaurants in this city have been allocated flour or bread. They have now received orders from the authorities to stop rationing from June 1. It is heard that the authorities also intend to transfer all of the saved flour to be allocated for consumption by ordinary people in this city.</p>

<p>The various silver money shops in this city will, as usual, prepare for the closing accounts for the first half of this year (January to June), starting next week.

<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to facilitate citizens and prevent overcharging, has begun concentrating the registration of private rickshaws and tricycles in the city starting from the beginning of this month. In recent days, the number of vehicles registered at the bureau's central district office has been extremely high. Because the procedure is simple and fast, it has been praised for its convenience. In particular, for vehicles registered in the former eight districts, the finance department of that district has sent personnel to collect payments. Therefore, most vehicles have already completed most of the registration. As for the vehicles registered in the former first district, the number is relatively large. Because the finance department has not yet sent personnel to collect payments, those registering vehicles still need to go to the Gordon Road area to make payments. It is now understood that the authorities have already reached an agreement with the finance department. Tomorrow (the 12th), personnel will be sent to the bureau's central district office to collect donations for the registration license plates of private tricycles and rickshaws in the former first district. Citizens will not need to make futile trips back and forth.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Reader Scholarship News: Please Take Note of Schools Collecting Application Forms on Behalf of Students <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The seventh session of application forms for the scholarship provided by the readers of this newspaper will be distributed to various schools starting tomorrow. We hope that the authorities of each school will pay attention to the following points: Many letters have been received from schools. The office cannot reply immediately. Please have each school indicate the number of applications needed one day in advance and pick up the forms the day after. The number of application forms to be collected on behalf of each school should be limited to 5% of the student population. Only those who have received more assistance in the previous session may be given some flexibility. Therefore, the number of application forms issued may be insufficient for the number of applicants. Please have each school make its own selection. The student population in Shanghai is no less than several hundred thousand. Without this restriction, not only would the chances of applicants being approved be too small, but also the processing would be extremely difficult due to the excessive number of people. Therefore, we must ask each school to make a preliminary selection. Please cooperate with the authorities of each school. When each school collects the application forms on behalf of students, if the general situation survey form has not yet been filled out, the office will first hand the survey form to the person who comes to collect the forms to take back and temporarily postpone the issuing of the application forms. Please forgive us. If a school has branch campuses, it is best for the main campus to collect the application forms. Otherwise, both the main campus and the branch campus must have explanations in their letters. If there is no explanation, once the application forms are issued, they will not be issued again.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Actual Conditions of Rice Procurement in Kunshan County: Political Organizations and Procurement Methods Must Be Refreshed <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper has received a special report from the Damao Xinbao's Bamboo Root correspondent, who recently visited Kunshan, Taicang, and other places to conduct on-the-ground investigations into the rice procurement situation. The report details the actual conditions of rice procurement and various perspectives. Our newspaper is publishing it now for our readers' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the various issues of rice procurement in Kunshan County, the reporter has made every effort to investigate. Here is a summary of opinions from various parties:</p>
<p>1.  The organization and operation of the Rice Control Association should quickly break away from the inland-centric approach and fully leverage the flexibility to adapt to the unique circumstances of each region.</p>
<p>2.  Eliminate the weakening of multiple inland procurement agencies and establish a unified, powerful system to address the urgency of special situations.</p>
<p>3.  Not only refrain from forcefully procuring from farmers but also prioritize providing allocations to farmers. The materials necessary for procurement, especially fertilizers, should be centrally planned and allocated by the procurement agency.</p>
<p>4.  The so-called "appropriate price" announced during procurement, even if as high as the market price, will inevitably be surpassed by the market price as procurement progresses. Given this unavoidable trend, the methods and timing of announcing procurement prices should be deeply reconsidered. Stabilizing currency value and overall prices is the primary condition for successful procurement. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to the same failure as a low-price policy.</p>
<p>5.  Whether administrative procurement or free procurement is adopted, the combined cooperation of political power, military power, and procurement power is absolutely necessary. Political organizations and procurement methods must be comprehensively refreshed to facilitate such cooperation.</p>
<p>The above are merely abstract conclusions, hence the need to report in detail the concrete and practical situations that led to these conclusions. The findings of the investigation are presented in a question-and-answer format to clarify the actual situation of rice procurement in Kunshan County.</p>
<p>Actual Situation of Rice Procurement</p>
<p>Question: What is the current status of the Kunshan Rice Control Association Office, the Preparatory Committee of the Purchasing Trade Association, and the ××× comprador trading house?</p>
<p>Answer: The Kunshan Office oversees Kunshan and Taicang counties. The Preparatory Committee of the Rice Purchasing Trade Association consists of seventeen firms from Kunshan and five from Taicang, totaling twenty-two. ××× has ×××, ××, and ×× foreign firms in Kunshan, while only ×× foreign firm is in Taicang. The quantity of purchases handled by compradors is roughly the same for Chinese and foreign parties (Chinese side claims more), but the actual quantity purchased by the Chinese side is less than half that of the foreign side. Currently, Shanghai and various organizations are advocating for the abolition of local offices and the streamlining of designated purchasing merchants. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Answer: It goes without saying that the lower-level organizations of the Rice Control Association in various regions must be thoroughly reformed. However, advocating for maintaining only the Rice Control Association headquarters while abolishing its lower-level organizations is like cutting off the limbs and leaving only the head alive. If the Rice Control Association is to be abolished altogether, that is a different matter. But if it is to remain and be responsible for procuring special rice, then a strong lower-level organization that follows its directives and commands is absolutely necessary. There is no room for argument. In short, the essential thing is to organize a unified procurement control organization composed of excellent Chinese and foreign purchasing merchants in each procurement area. For example, the purchasing organization of the foreign side has comprador groups, ×××, and thirteen sub-contracting trading houses. Its command and control system is extremely complex and diversified. In each region, which is the front line for rice procurement, there is no unified comprador group. As for the Chinese side, although the designated purchasing merchants are nominally the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Association, they actually act independently. They are neither a trade association nor its preparatory committee. Therefore, each firm should abandon its small, individualistic stance and adopt the position of a larger, unified control organization to move towards seamless procurement activities. What is most desired is that, regarding rice procurement in each region, the greatest authority should be granted to such unified procurement organizations within a certain scope concerning funds, prices, personnel, procurement, and material allocation.</p>
<p>Question: It is said that the Office and the Preparatory Committee of the Purchasing Trade Association have many flaws.</p>
<p>Answer: The personnel of the Office are determined primarily by the will of Shanghai, and when the true representatives of the trading houses in the procurement areas do not participate, it merely formally establishes a vertical relationship with Shanghai. Furthermore, few local rice merchants with a long history participate in the Preparatory Committee. Most of the members of the Preparatory Committee reside in Shanghai and other places, and they often absent themselves from important meetings. This is the reality.</p>
<p>Question: If the procurement price is adjusted, will the rice flow into the channels like water flowing downhill?</p>
<p>Answer: This is an extremely urgent time. I doubt anyone here indulges in such convenient and irresponsible thinking. What could be bought for one hundred yuan last month now requires two hundred yuan this month. If this general instability of currency value is not addressed, future procurement will remain difficult. Because of the idea that goods are more valuable than paper money, a considerable number of people in various places are hoarding rice for one or two years. They are unlikely to release their stocks solely due to a high-price procurement policy. In addition, the act of announcing prices itself has the effect of driving up rice prices. This must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Question: Why is there a significant discrepancy between the assigned quantity and the actual purchased quantity?</p>
<p>Question: The rice production of Kunshan County is approximately 1.5 million shi of rough rice. Based on the instructions of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the actual purchase quantity should be 55%. However, under normal circumstances, the possible procurement limit is about 20% to 30%. Therefore, the target quantity was inherently flawed from the beginning, especially since last year's production had already decreased by 20% to 30%. However, the county has good public order and is a model county in Jiangsu Province. A procurement plan was formulated even before the rice ripened, with plans to correct consumption by encouraging substitute foods to ensure the largest possible quantity. However, the Rice Control Association Office was established in November, and procurement did not begin until late November, which was already too late. Therefore, the above plans could not be implemented. In addition, the market price was high, so setting a target quantity that could definitely be achieved might have had a good ideological impact on farmers.</p>
<p>Question: Does Kunshan County adopt administrative procurement, free procurement, or a combination of both?</p>
<p>Answer: The supply system is uniform. The initial goal was to implement administrative procurement of one shi per mu (though very few mu yielded two shi). However, in many places in the fifth district of this county, for example, only eight dou are produced per mu, yet they were still required to supply one shi. Therefore, farmers ultimately could not comply with the supply directives, and the results were naturally not good. Overall, since a supply system was adopted, it was necessary to establish regional quotas between Chinese and foreign firms. Although the Rice Control Association has in principle abolished the regional quota system, Kunshan County implements regional quotas for each firm to ensure supply and prevent free competition. This is based on the agreement between Chinese and foreign firms.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a tendency for corruption in the procurement funds allocated by the Rice Control Association?</p>
<p>Answer: The Rice Control Association's loans to designated purchasing merchants, only for the Chinese side, totaled approximately 43.7 million yuan by March 10, approximately 24.7 million yuan from March 11 to the end of April, and approximately 3.3 million yuan in mid-May, reaching a total of 71.7 million yuan. There are various speculations as to where these huge amounts of funds were used. As for the trading houses on the foreign side, in light of the experience of brokers abusing fixed foreign exchange in the 31st year, they have avoided using last year's methods as much as possible, so the abuses have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Question: The Rice Control Association previously used five types of daily necessities as exchange goods. Have these goods actually been allocated to farmers?</p>
<p>Answer: This year, measures have been taken to prevent embezzlement, and it is believed that most of the goods have been directly delivered to farmers. One thousand yuan is paired with a two hundred yuan allocation. However, one thousand yuan of rice, in terms of sheng and dou, amounts to about one shi and six dou, so the calculation of material allocation is very troublesome. For example, allocating 0.2 yun of soap, 1.2 small boxes of matches, and 3 liang of sugar for every 1.6 dou is annoying for both the calculators and the recipients. Also, regarding cotton cloth, farmers say that 3.5 yards is not enough to make clothes. Because farmers generally supply about 3 shi of rice, they only receive about two white vouchers for allocation. If various materials are finely distributed, the procedures are too cumbersome. It is hoped that the Rice Control Association will not prioritize its own convenience in calculations by using a ratio of one thousand yuan to two hundred yuan, but rather consider the convenience of farmers and procurers. Decide on the amount to be allocated per shi. This is indeed a small point, but it contains the fundamental meaning of the work. The five types of exchange goods may have some effect on alleviating the emotions of farmers, but they may not necessarily promote procurement. The most effective allocation is ammonium sulfate. Although its allocation is handled by cooperatives, it is necessary to plan procurement and allocation as a unified process as much as possible.</p>
<p>Question: What are your hopes for the Beijing and Shanghai areas?</p>
<p>Answer: It is hoped that the reform of the organization will not be delayed until the end of November this year, as it did last year, which missed the opportune time for procurement. Establishing a plan now will not be too early. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government, various councils, the Rice Control Association, etc., are working hard on the problem of rice purchases, but it is hoped that they will not change their direction frequently. Commence procurement early and complete the expected results before the Lunar New Year. In order to implement free procurement in the future, establish procurement principles and quickly put them into practice. (Translation by Ji)</p>
