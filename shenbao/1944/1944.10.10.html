<h3>國慶日的願望</h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，一年容易，又是國慶日了。每逢國慶，照例紀念慶祝，我們也照例撰文應景。可是，我們觀察目前的時局環境，實已不容我們從容慶祝了。今天我們並無特殊獻言，不過重溫舊課，所謂溫故而知新，今後更應切實的警覺與實踐而已。我們列舉願望數事，以興國人共勉之：　　第一，對於個人方面的願望。首先，認識時代環境，目前是面臨大東亞決戰的時代，爲爭取最後勝利，每個人都有貢獻其力量的責任。怎樣貢獻其力量呢？一方面各自站在崗位上積極努力，每個人各有其本身的職務，職務就是崗位。所以，不一定赴前綫，衝鋒陷陣，纔是貢獻力量，現代戰爭是總力戰，就是各方面各部門力量的總和。每個人的崗位，在總力戰範圍中，莫不有其一部分的力量，祗要努力本位工作，增高其效率，那末，就是貢獻了力量，盡了決戰總力中的一份子責任。另一方面，則爲實踐戰時生活。戰時生活至少包含刻苦與嚴肅的氣息，所以，浪費散漫的生活，絕對不是戰時生活應有的現象。實踐戰時生活，其目的在節約物資以外，同時，復訓練刻苦嚴肅的習慣，堅定其意志。盟邦日本國內一億人民，全體團結一致，從事戰爭，人民有數月不知肉味者，其刻苦節約的習慣，殊可供我們取法。　　第二，對於地方方面的願望。凡是一個地方的人，對於所居住地方的一切，必須負保衛責任。譬如我們是居住於上海的人，那末，我們對於上海就有保衛責任。[國家興望，匹夫有責]，我們更可以說：[上海興望，上海人有責]。地方保衛責任盡了，後方就可安定，對於前方的貢獻，就可盡更大力量。所以，地方事業，應有地方人士共同負責，對於公益必具熱忱，切不可袖手旁觀，更不可隔岸觀火。我們必須認清[頗之不存，毛將焉附]。如果地方治安不良，則地方人士決無安寗的。　　第三，對於國家方面。我們環顧當前國家情形，支離破碎，良用痛心。國家愈是困難，我們愈要愛國。過去的失敗，由於一般人缺乏國家觀念。沒有國家觀念的人，也決不會明白大東亞的重要。也就不能明白解放戰爭的重要。可是，大東亞戰爭已是決定大東亞各國家民族的命運戰爭，大東亞的興亡，在此一戰，中國的成敗，自然也在此一戰。　　最後，對於盟邦日本方面，[無日本，即無中國，無中國，即無日本]，已經爲中日兩國有識之士所共認。日本對華新政策，以及大東亞共榮圈新秩序的意義，必須使中國人民普遍了解。怎樣使中國人民普遍了解呢？我們認爲以[得民心]爲第一，從遠處着眼，從近處入手。凡是政策以至於各種措施的決定。必須事前得到中國民間的擁護，尤以先使民間領袖得到諒解，使傳達於一般人民。我們更認爲軍事政治經濟三者並重，均以[得民心]爲第一，中國方面自也以極誠懇的態度，共同應付決戰局面。</p>
<h3>中樞今隆重舉行雙十節國慶紀念全國各地將展開熱烈祝典</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　今日國慶，國府上午隆重舉行慶典，所屬長官，各機關高級職員參加。文官國民服或籃袍黑掛，佩勳表。軍官軍常服，佩刀佩勳表。　　南京九日中央社電　今（十）日爲三十三年國慶紀念日，全國各地均將懸旗誌慶一日。中樞各機關及全國各地各政府機關各級學校等，均將休假一日，以誌慶賀。　　南京九日中央社電　十日爲國慶紀念日，國府軍事委員會爲示隆重慶賀起見，特於十日上午十時舉行閱兵典禮。閱兵塲所預定爲小營廣塲，如遇陰雨則在國府舉行。所有參與閱兵典禮之各部隊士兵，計有警衛第一二三師所屬各部隊，及中央陸軍軍官學校學生等數千人。典禮秩序，計爲○恭迎式，○閱兵式，○分列，式○恭送式。　　南京九日中央社電　三十三年國慶紀念日，首都熱烈展開慶祝。上午七時半，開始警察總檢閱，九時在國府舉行慶祝典禮，國民大會堂舉行首都民衆大會。十時閱兵，下午外部招待外賓茶會，影院加映早塲，廉價招待，游藝塲取半價一日。畫片劇隊出動公演，住民商店懸旗誌賀，交通要衝縣巨幅國旗及橫額，街頭張貼標語，信件加蓋紀念郵戳。</p>
<h3>日軍完成大陸縱橫作戰</h3>
<p>粉碎渝美反攻企圖　　日軍某基地中央社九日電　據三谷海軍報道班員，縱某日艦發來電報稱：自敵美開始反攻加達爾卡納爾島以來，冒慘重犧牲，成功奪得太平洋上一部份島嶼。敵美以龐大之鐵量自恃，採取紙上談兵之大陸登陸進擊作戰計劃，開始在太平洋作全面的反攻，同時謀算加強以大陸爲基地之在渝美空軍。另一方面，敵人恐懼日本利用南方資源增進戰鬥力，故爲加以阻止計，除出動空軍外，復於日本近海及中國東海南海密佈潛艇，企圖切斷日軍接濟路綫，以減弱日方戰鬥力。尤其是溫州·福州·更受敵美重視，積極防備。蓋該兩地爲敵潛艇最好之接濟基地，又美軍在大陸登陸進擊時，且可重用爲立足點。此外敵人並在接近東海南海之麗水·贛州·玉山·建甌·龍嚴·等飛行基地，加強空軍勢力，謀擊潰日船隊。又潛入日駐華艦隊封鎖綫，在東海無人荒島上，設置監視哨，瞭望台等，企圖與在渝美空軍基地及敵潛艇取得連絡。日駐華艦隊ＸＸ部隊，爲粉碎敵人野心，於攻陷溫州後，繼續在ＸＸＸＸＸＸ等多數地點登陸，包緊沿岸封鎖綱，並取得立足點，使敵人潛艇飛機無活動餘地。當九月二十七日，陸軍部隊在福州東北方登陸時，海軍部隊擔任護衛任務，兵不血刃，完成登陸作戰，此次攻陷溫州·福州·其意義在能獲得戰略上重要戰果，自大陸羅橫作戰成功後，隣近中國東南沿岸之在渝美空軍基地，其接濟路綫已悉被切斷，形成孤立狀態，除自趨滅亡外，別無生路，至此尼米茲與麥克活塞亦自知大陸登陸作戰之不易。　　南京九日中央社電福建省沿岸之最大要衝福州，業經陷落，日軍在中國沿岸作戰之防衛益形鞏固。日軍日前攻佔溫州，今又佔領福州，中國沿岸地帶，南自海南島·廣州灣·香港·廣州·汕頭·厦門·各機動據點，以至上海以北之黃海海岸，均爲日軍所據。今爲浙閩二省海岸五百公里內之二大據點溫州·福州·亦爲日軍佔領，此對日軍之作戰上，至爲有利。對渝軍及渝美空軍之反攻上，給予一大打擊，渝當局整頓敗軍，有待日軍戰綫延長時，隨時出擊之勢。然日軍現已由軍事之階段，進而爲政治之階段，此點實不容忽視。</p>
<h3>急襲成都附近機塲</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午三時發表：○中國方面日軍航空隊，會於七日夜冒惡劣天氣，先制急襲集結於成都會近飛機塲，而準備出動之美空軍，予以重大打擊。○戰果，於彭山飛機塲方面，擊毀及使其中彈起火之飛機，有B２９型者二十三架，小型十九架，機種不明者二架，合計四十四架外，有地上設施一處，中彈起火，於其他飛機塲所獲戰果，因天氣惡劣關係，確認有數處起炎外，尚未得其詳。○日方之損失自炸一架。　　中國前綫某基地九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，七日晚冒雨轟炸成都，渝機將起飛，因天氣所阻乃稍遲。日機則乘機予以先制強襲，確悉經擊毀二十三架，焚燒四架·日機安然無事歸返，同時日機別動隊，並在夜襲新津大平寺及寶雜等機塲·炸碎地上及航空設施。</p>
<h3>先發制人獲大戰果</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日空軍爲鎭壓駐渝美空軍，會於七日急襲成都機塲，焚毀渝美機共達四十四架，此次作戰意義之重大，實與過去擊滅B２９型機之作戰不同，蓋此次日機前往轟炸，適在敵機起飛之際，故在日軍先發制人之戰略下，而蒙重創。溯敵機於九月八日及二十六日，會兩度轟炸南滿，然因遭日空軍邀擊，八日損失四十架，二十六日損失三十五架，但彼等雖受重大打擊，然會企圖空襲日本土，故此次日軍機乃行先發制人，使成都機塲羣受重創。按日空軍會於是日冒惡劣天氣，於大雨中出動，嗣經探索多時後，卒發現蝟集於新津南方彭出機塲中之渝美機羣，遂予以猛擊，當使其損失四十四架，計炸毀及起火燃燒之B２９型機達二十三架，其餘十九架爲小型機，此外尚有二架機型不明。又其他一隊，亦於是日轟炸新津萬縣，及太平洋等機塲，均已收獲莫大戰果，其間僅一月，即使彼等損失一百十九架，日方僅損失一架。</p>
<h3>桂第一綫發生激戰</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據美國泰晤士報接重慶訪員八日訊稱，日軍與渝軍目下在廣西第一綫激戰，兩軍後方交鋒極活躍。日軍方面除修復平漢路，更進行修築粵漢路，直修至衡陽南方，用以輸送對桂林展開大攻勢之武器軍需。渝軍兵力謀阻擾日軍之攻勢，白崇禧三週前謁見蔣介石，次日即飛赴桂林親身指揮。刻渝軍正絡續向桂林地區派遺援軍，駐渝美空軍亦正對渝方守軍盡力接濟，又五師學生兵，亦開始招募云。</p>
<h3>桂湘日軍取包圍勢</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據美聯社駐重慶訪員訊，廣西及湖南戰況如次：中國東南部戰局，已到頂點，目前已達桂林大會戰之前夕。茲日軍於中部地區，已漸次採取包圍攻勢，而以兩大包圍之巨流，俾向處於三百個高地中之桂林。其他由東北方向湘桂鐵路南下，突破興安之渝軍警戒綫西進二十公里，到達離水（距桂林四十公里）之第二渡船塲，此地前方有離水河谷之狹隘間隙，斯即到達桂林平原之入口。其一即由此間平樂（制扼東南方之交通中樞）前進，採取廣範圍之包圍形勢。按日軍於上週前進五十六公里後，因整備部隊，會一度中止前進。○南部地區日軍，由廣東沿西江急向前進，於上週開抵平南北上平樂，由是日軍已與向南進攻桂林之部隊取得互相連絡之態勢，惟從日軍向江口西進一點而觀，即知日軍將更要進至柳州，從南方遮斷桂林，使該市渝軍越過山岳向西退卻，甚或溯航直趨南寗，從而確立朝鮮至昭南之交通綫。並在湖南及西北地區，粉碎寶慶渝軍最後之抵抗，茲該方面日軍已著著向貴陽挺進，但通往貴陽之公路，極不利於車輛之運行，且有易於防禦之山嶽綿亙其間。良以貴陽之佔領，僅爲遮斷昆明之第一步，吾人從以上各點而觀，寶慶日軍之強力攻擊，料亦僅係掩護進擊桂林側面之表現而已。</p>
<h3>必阿克島日軍完成守土任務</h3>
<p>日陸省褒揚葛目大佐精神　　東京九日中央社電五月二十七日敵軍於新幾內亞島西北必阿克島登陸，當地日軍葛目大佐部隊，於敵軍猛炸下，對一師之敵敢然邀擊，晝夜擊襲，展開血戰，敵軍疲於暇息，頗爲焦燥，一方軍機隊亦與此葛目部隊之作戰相呼應，對敵軍海洋艦，驅逐艦，登陸角舟艇等反覆攻擊，予以重創。至六月十一日止，所獲戰果，計敵軍棄屍一千五百餘具及毀壞其火砲八門，然敵方遂次增強兵力，六月末已增強對一師半，因此該島機塲逐落於敵軍手中。日軍葛目部隊長，於七月二日亦壯烈戰死，部下將兵繼承該隊長之遺忘，或於深夜潛入敵陣，或以白刃突入敵陣，後更掘洞穴陣於數百尺地之壕道中，彼此聯絡，迄今約五閱月，該島日軍況於隔絕補給之一小島中，完成守土大任。　　東京九日中央社電本年五月敵美自必阿克島登陸以來，該島日守軍即以寡軍予敵以重創，同時並能確保該島之要地，寺內南方最高指揮官以該島日守軍厥功甚偉，該對島守軍及部隊長葛目直幸大佐，特給褒狀，日陸軍省八日亦發表如次褒狀。</p>
<h3>褒狀</h3>
<p>必阿克島守軍，自昭和十九年（民國三十三年）五月二十七日敵軍登陸後，以寡兵累次大舉反入優勢之敵軍，予敵以重創，並能確保該島之要地，於作戰上之貢獻，功績實大。該部隊於葛目大佐指揮下，能團結一體，以不屈不撓之精神，堅持作戰，發揮日軍之精神，其功績實爲全軍之寶鑑，茲特授與褒狀，昭和十九年八月一日，南方最高指軍官寺內壽一。</p>
<h3>感狀</h3>
<p>陸軍大佐葛目直幸，自昭和十八年十二月以來，即率必阿克島守軍，協力海軍守備必島，昭和十九年五月八日，敵軍企圖在必阿克島登陸，冒砲擊轟炸，次於海邊擊破敵軍，然敵恃其優勢兵力，艦砲射擊，反復轟炸，強行登陸，守軍雖寡兵善鬥，至敵軍登陸後，仍能利用暗夜奇襲，予敵生大打擊，大佐奮戰於陣頭，七月二日中彈陣亡，對全局有利，茲授與感狀，且布告全軍，昭和十九年八月十六日，南方方而陸軍最高指揮官寺內壽一。</p>
<h3>敵機襲泰緬被擊落三架</h3>
<p>仰光九日中央社電敵空軍於本月六日會以B２４型，B２５型轟炸機以及戰鬥機等，或單獨，或編隊，分別襲泰·緬各地日軍後方空軍基地，日防空隊當即邀擊之，計擊落B２４型一架，B２５型二架，日軍亦損失二架。</p>
<h3>滿鐵總裁昨晨飛日</h3>
<p>新京九日中央社電滿鐵總裁小日尼，爲與日政府當局商討要務，已於九日上午搭機東上，預定在日滯留一月。</p>
<h3>培里琉島日軍夜襲敵機塲</h3>
<p>三週來予敵重大損害　　東京九日中央社電培里琉島日軍奮戰三週後，巳予敵以一萬八千以上之大損害，日軍將士乃與五日夜日軍敢死隊一部突破敵軍嚴密之警戒，潛入飛機塲，予敵軍及其守備以重創，是夜零時半至二時十分，兩小時餘可望見敵機塲之大火，六日，敵會進攻日守備陣地南端東岸及北部水府山，日軍予以大損害，大部擊退，然東山之敵，有一部侵入日軍陣地，開始構築陣地，日守軍目下準備擊滅敵軍。培里琉島及帛琉本島哥斯索爾等海面敵艦船之行動，仍極頻繁，七日晚敵醫院船又赴培里琉島收容死傷者，帛琉本島及克羅爾島敵機來襲益烈，六日共計三百數十架，七日共四百七十架，培里琉機塲之敵機來襲，達相當數量，敵機躱避日軍，對空陣地之轟炸與砲擊，與過去不同，力求節用，並恐懼損等</p>
<h3>松島部長談福州陷落意義</h3>
<p>粉碎英美未來進攻企圖　　日海軍中國方面艦隊報道部長松島大佐，七日曾就福州陷落之意義，發表談話，其大意謂：福州陷落之意義，爲華南沿岸澈底粉碎英美未來進攻之作戰，敵企圖於此等地帶，樹立諜報·潛水艇及航空基地等，於敵方宣傳中，巳屢見不鮮，尤其敵軍企圖與駐渝美空軍協力，於中國沿岸地帶，早日設置橋頭堡，此來福州已顯然爲其重要候補地之一，故此要地於今後作戰之進展上，關係至爲重大。本次作戰中最值注目者，爲日陸海部隊出動海洋作戰，更有日海軍中國方面艦隊，海空一體之陣勢，敵使駐渝美空軍束手無策，由此更可表現日海軍之實力健全之程度。同時敵方會屢次宣傳，美軍已於福州附近三都澳設置潛水艇基地一事，亦可由此證明，皆屬虛傳之反宣傳。不論重慶與美軍如何計劃，企圖使中國樂土化爲戰塲，日軍必不惜任何犧牲，予以阻止，實則此次日軍作戰，乃大東亞戰爭轉爲攻勢之開始。余信當地中國民衆，必將歡迎日軍，欣然協力擊滅英美之作戰。</p>

<h3>美蘇渝間摩擦新疆糾紛內幕只有槍砲可以解決</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於新疆糾紛問題，蘇聯會派飛機轟炸迪化，美蘇渝間之摩擦，日形尖銳。渝方爲緩和空氣起見，特將新疆省長盛世才調出，頃據此間可靠消息，關於新疆糾紛與美蘇渝間之摩擦情形，至爲詳細，茲特分述如下：新疆乃</p>
<h3>中國後門</h3>
<p>美國副總統華萊士於此次訪渝後，亦謂彼此次從美到重應，亦從中國之後門而入重慶，新疆乃重要所在，仍從中國後門新疆返美。華萊士爲何要一再提起新疆問題呢，此中有一重要原因，事實經過是如此的：蘇聯在新疆方面擴充勢力已有多年，不論在政治、經濟、軍事上，新疆幾爲蘇聯之一部份。新疆省主席盛世才，總算沒有把他祖國的中國忘掉，在最近幾年來，他一面委曲求全的應付着蘇聯，一面積極擴充新疆省之內在力。但是蘇聯則不能再容忍盛主席之敷衍政策，事態嚴重，是發生在去年初冬，盛世才之弟盛國雄，他不愧爲忠於祖國的勇士，他深知蘇聯之壓迫，是具有</p>
<h3>領土野心</h3>
<p>同時蘇聯之唆使獨立運動，是分化祖國獨立的力量。蘇聯會經一再提出與新疆省政府簽訂條約，無異新疆憶成爲中國之獨立省份，他憤慨的將這陰謀報告渝政權，在他接洽返新疆省之第六天，他竟被蘇聯之第五縱隊所暗殺，他爲祖國而犧牲，爲新疆省而犧牲。熱血沸騰的盛世才，眼看着蘇聯唆使中國共產黨的活潑擾亂治安，不得不採取軍事行動。他一面調軍隊保護迪化省垣，一面飛報渝府請派大軍馳往援助，這樣草木皆兵的馧釀了數月，終於在渝軍（朱紹良部隊）抵達迪化後不久，戰事遂告爆發。在新疆共產軍正式成立之政府向迪化進攻，新疆軍渝軍則在守土有責之使命下，從事抵抗。無訓練之共產軍當然經不起砲擊，</p>
<h3>遂乃崩潰</h3>
<p>然在共軍失敗期間（本年七月初，）迪化高空發現巨型轟炸機向下掃射，並且擲下無數燒夷彈，此乃盛世才與渝軍將領所始終未料到之事，蘇聯竟公然爲其軍後援，因此渝蔣於接到緊急情報後，立即下令停戰。同時向蘇聯提起嚴重抗議，亦屬不免之手續，一面乃加緊新聞統制，所有新疆方面戰事消息，絕對禁止發表，以免刺激人心，同時迫不得已後，再向華盛頓之白宮主人申訴請求調解。如此經過美蘇渝三方而不少電報之往返談判，結果蘇聯總算表示讓步，但要求將肇事之盛主席世才調出新疆，一切問題從外交方式解決，共軍渝軍各返防地，盛世才遂返重慶，蔣介石之御用機關參政會，特爲此破例舉行盛大歡迎會，將盛世才譽爲模範軍人。甚而每次會議，均由蔣氏陪同出席，就是重慶軍政界均認爲最光榮之一頁。以後新疆問題是如何結束，美國槍砲，蘇聯槍砲，渝方槍砲，一般人均認爲只有槍砲方可解決</p>
<h3>新疆問題</h3>
<p>但是重慶政權於表面上，仍然繼續採用媚態外交對付蘇聯，此乃彼等強調中蘇兩國之親善合作。本月五日，渝大公報亦復主張中蘇友好關係加強，尤其主張以選拔優秀人才組織國民親善使節團，趕速派到莫斯科，以加強中蘇關係。另一方而，新任新省主席吳忠信，於本月五日召集省府，及各廳處所屬職員作親事訓話時，也提起中蘇關係問題。謂[新疆居中蘇交通要衝，在親仁善鄰原則下，實負有不可忽視之任務。本人當一本渝政權之意旨，積極使中蘇友誼合作精神加強]於此可知渝政積極向蘇聯表示親善，但蘇聯至今仍然鄙視重慶，所以蘇聯對新疆之野心，重慶與第三國將如何對付蘇聯，必將遺成重慶邊疆上一大問題，同時更造成英美實力，因此其間關係益錯綜復雜。在東亞方面，英美蘇渝之相互關係，其摩擦　結，大有發炎點之可能。</p>
<h3>宇垣大將抵京</h3>

<h3>東綫南北兩翼攻防戰熾烈</h3>
<p>蘇出動兵力七十五師　　柏林九日中央社電海通社訊：蘇軍以七十五師之兵力，進攻東綫北部及南部，其中三十師向里加灣及東普魯士推進，尚有坦克隊及步兵四十五師向洪國推進，戰況激烈，但德軍防務並未動搖。立陶宛方面德軍主力已後撤，蘇軍未能突破德軍之彈性防綫。東綫南部天氣好轉，辦軍猛攻喀爾巴阡山森林區域，並在杜克拉山隘以東，以步兵十二師進攻，在數處進攻達十次之多。巴爾幹方面蘇軍在泰斯河與克萊煦河間繼續推進，德洪聯軍予以極大阻礙。多瑙河泰斯河合流處，蘇軍橋頭堡兩處遭受反攻，不能西進，扎傑卡之守軍仍抵抗蘇軍猛攻。</p>

<h3>德新軍在西綫作戰勇猛</h3>
<p>亞琛區激戰中　　柏林九日中央社電海通社訊：德軍擲彈兵師雖成立未久，但在西綫遏阻反軸心軍之戰爭中，已著有決定性之功勳。記者最近訪問摩塞爾區該新師團作戰之綫，見該師擁有最新式之武器，於十日之內擊退美軍六次乏進攻，新軍之兵士多屬目十八歲至二十歲之青年，訓練完全，士氣旺盛，故每必捷。　　柏林九日中央社電據海通社訊：美軍在亞琛區域猛攻，並未能突破防綫。西綫戰事焦點，復移至北翼，而蓋稜克城以南朗勃維勒（ambervillers）與魯爾問·及梅茲區域亦在激戰中。安特衡普以東些耳德河德軍橋頭堡，德軍阻止反軸心軍利用安特衡普海港，敵軍屢次猛攻該橋頭堡，但遭堅強抵抗，向東北及北而進展甚微。尼美根戰況亦趨激烈，英軍增援尚未能抵禦德軍之壓力·德軍在瓦爾河與勒克河間頗有進展，霍格斯將軍在蓋稜克城以南，以砲隊及飛機協助坦克軍隊，進攻烏巴樞，巴倫堡（Ubach-Palenberg）東面之德軍陣地，美第一軍突入德軍防綫，德軍反攻刻在激戰中。梅茲綫戰況週末益趨激烈，美軍在馬契倫（Maacheren）附近之德軍陣綫造成缺口，但德軍在特里安（Dram）附近及百樂森林（Parroy）反攻頗爲得手，美第七軍在西綫南翼郎勃維勒與魯爾間繼續活動，但德軍已將格朗特維勒附近之缺品塡平，萊密安蒙特以南之美軍亦遭德軍阻止。</p>
<h3>鄧扣克港淪爲廢墟</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國社訊：反軸心不斷之砲彈與炸彈，已完成德工兵隊在鄧扣克堡壨所進行破壞軍事設備之工作，該堡壘已漸成一片廢墟。同時所有落入敵手中之一切堡壘與港口，如瑟堡·哈佛·聖瑪羅·勃萊斯特·與加萊等，仍無補於英美軍起卸供應品之用。</p>
<h3>艾登解釋英政策趨勢</h3>
<p>日內瓦九日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦息：英外相艾登昨向英下院宣稱·此次大戰之教訓，已顯示公衆利益必須高出個人利益，英工人已表示大企業如礦區，交通機關及電氣廠，均須改爲國營。英實業之地位必須提高，俾於戰後保持英國社會安全，故私人企業須賦與自由活動權。艾氏論及外交政策時宣稱，吾人當謀全世界和平，否則任何人均不能享受和平。</p>
<h3>埃及內閣總理那哈斯免職</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　海通社訊，開羅消息：埃及國王法魯克，已將內閣總理那哈斯免職。阿麥特馬赫巴薩奉命組織新閣。</p>
<h3>中共竭力挾擊渝軍政</h3>
<p>中央社訊　延安政權與蘇聯之關係，向頗密切，最近又推派代表秦邦憲·王明·專赴莫斯科訪問，直接向蘇聯政府商妥結果確保蘇聯之援助，因此中共有表示[未來的中國天下在我乎之槪]。于是延安在最近對渝方態度益趨強硬，不時挾擊渝政權。頃據可靠方而消息，本月四日陝甘寗邊區政府，爲慶祝雙十國慶特組織籌備委會員，並利用會的名義，發表談話，不惜對渝方抨擊。其內容稱，我人深切明瞭，在未獲得勝利以前，其前途有頗大障碍物之存在，影響至鉅，此即渝國民黨的一貫獨裁政策，亦即毫無朝氣之軍事政治機構。該少數之獨裁政權之工作究竟如何，根據下列數點，可知一般：一在屢戰屢敗後，不容別人擊戰，乃作有計劃之解散共黨，消滅八路軍新四軍五分之四兵力，其餘五分之一兵力，則擬主張收編在敗戰主義的統一軍權之下。二彼輩之企圖，已實行法西斯主義，放棄三民主義，反對三民主義，此點尼見不許實行民主政治。但在表而上則允許地方自治，人民實行參政，惟與事實完全相反。三渝方屢戰屢敗結果，已使反軸心國在中國領土內之反攻企圖，完全失敗。故爲反對渝國民黨之專制，立即召開臨時國民大會，召集各黨各派，及各地方軍隊政府，以及各公共團體人才，更要求實行改組渝政權，及軍事委員會，以組織聯立政府，及聯合軍事委員會，實行革命的三民主義。如今共黨抨擊頗甚，故渝共之磨擦問題，其過程又移轉至英美蘇渝四國的談判中。惟渝軍在湘桂粵軍事失敗後，對共黨應付表示消極，其原因實由于華盛頓之壓力結果。然渝軍戰門力量之衰落，當爲中共在國際上之活動予以良好機會，渝方有識人士，對渝共問題之討論，深認嚴重。</p>

<h3>昨日防空演習成績較前進步防空本部發表評語</h3>
<p>市民防空本部關於昨日防空訓練，發表如下之評語：　　綜合第十次防空日所舉行各種防空訓練之結果，認爲本國一般市民，對防空自覺甚在進步，尤以南京路一帶，市民所給予之協力，及待避訓練，雖係分區而施，但其中一部份，認爲較前有異常之進步。　　然吾人切不可因此自滿，蓋實際空襲時，目前之防空技術，恐尚未能達到保護各自生命安全之程度。敵方空襲，不僅於戰略上着想，且對本市之本國同胞，似尚有企圖，此可於對華中華南各地之轉炸情況，及空襲馬尼刺之實例見之。防空本部認爲雖一人之受傷，亦須盡量避免，一部份市民對本部此種方策之措施，每抱不關心態度，誠爲遺憾。此次訓練會利用最近於全市設立之監視哨崗，及運用待避爲主要項目，與向來僅限於範圍甚小之地區，及作高程度訓練企圖不同，於各地區內動員全部民衆，於其本區內舉行演習，市內經指定爲演習區域者，共有十七處之多，演習之結果，認爲尚須研討之問題若干點，特誌之於後，以供保甲自警團，防空班等作爲未來之參考。</p>
<h3>昨日應加改善各點</h3>
<p>此次訓練尚未脫過去之習慣，與達到市民總動員之理想相差尚遠，且一般基本訓練，尚未能充分，故期望指導者，體認止下　　　防空意識，俾下屬人員，團結挺進，同負啓發一般市民防空意識之責。茲將應改善之處記之於後：　　一，指定建築物作爲公共待避所時，須加考量，因建築物若係作爲營業之用，且平時已須收容多數之人，如再收容外來避難者，似甚困難，此外小建築之僅能收容數人或數十人者，似不宜作爲公共待避所。　　二，當空襲警報發令後，警察官，保甲人員，自警團員等對汽車，三輪車及腳踏車等，尚有准其繼續行駛者，殊爲不當。應迅速令其停於路邊，分散待避，且須注意與路角龍頭橋樑等保持適當之距離。　　三，直接參加防空之人員，所着服裝，雖漸有改善而利於活動，惟指導者尚有穿着長衫，或不便於防空活動之服裝出巡，殊屬遺憾。故指導者應先關心自身之服裝，並從速置備頭巾及手套等。　　四，待避係此次訓練之主要項目，雖指導綱要之發表與訓練期間，爲時甚暫，然一部份地區尚能令人滿意，此應感謝該區指導者之勳勞。其餘未能週全之地區，應注意下列各點。按待避係於敵機發現時或聞及機聲時，或由防空機關指示待避時，即須各自避免危險，暫時待避至安全處所，俟危險過後，再從事防空之活動，此點似尚未能完全澈底，尤其對傳達方法，應再改善，即由監視哨提示之狀況，應先報告指揮者再由指揮者於重要各所，配置傳遞哨，藉擔傳遞工作，並擔任隣近民衆之待避指導，防空人員不可橫臥於路中，以免危險。　　燈火管制雖平時成績甚佳，惟是夜未能認爲良好，尤以人力車，三輪車之燈火管制，尚欠完善，總之每次之訓練外表，雖有進步，惟時局日益緊迫，凡我市民務應覺認現在之演習，即等於實戰，以期達於萬全之境。</p>
<h3>各區消防演習成績</h3>
<p>昨（九）日爲第十次防空日，市民防空本部綜合本市各區消炎成績，作下列之講評：　　○關於消防演習　一防火用水之補給，頗有進步，但應預先準備，尤以蘇州河以南，非演習地區之貯水槽，尚有未將水裝滿，而僅槽底遺有少量之水。二用鉛桶携送防火水之人，似嫌過多，致反有缺乏迅速之感，應依情況及時機，設計加水方法，俾消防戰鬥，收良好之效果。三應加緊訓練風向之觀察，着重順風，俾防止延燒。四利用潤濕草蓆，以撲潔燒夷彈所發生之火，尚感缺秒，此在平時似無俾益，惟經數次之實騐後，即認爲有絕對利用之必要。五本市高建築甚多，故對於高處之消火方法，就厙研究。六本市尚有大多數中國式房屋，故除以鉛桶放水外，尚應利用手推帮浦。七除演習人員以外，仍有採取旁觀態度之市民，此點應予矯正。</p>
<h3>戶口粉今日發售</h3>
<p>加配黃豆二斤　　本市物品配給處，定今日起先從舊一區境內，開始配給黃豆，每人二市斤，每斤售中儲劵十五元，至本月二十二日止，凡該區內市民得憑第二十一號綜合聯票，向票上所列號碼相同之食米零售處購取，至其他各區配售黃豆，再行定期公告。同時戶口麵粉亦定於今日起發售，至二十二日截止，每人計二號粉一市斤，售中儲劵四十二元，舊一區內市民憑二十二號綜合聯票，其他各區憑前糧食局所發四十五期麵粉證購取。至戶口米內定本月十五日起普遍發售，每人仍售　市升。</p>

<p>該會賡續主辦之義演，今（十）日下午七時半，在大光明大戲院舉行電影演講大會，請李思浩氏主講·并定於明（十一）日下午七時半，假蘭心大戲院舉行話劇義演。據該會負責人語記者稱：該會今次慶祝遊藝入塲劵，全部有價出倍，槪無贈劵，同時往常舞台之贈劵簽票，一律暫停，除奉派維護秩序之憲警外，任何人均須購票進塲，事關慈善公益，故各方極表同情，除由市宣傳處贊助外，警務當避對於新聯會之熱心社會公益，頗爲贊許，故多方予以便利，全力維護。又十一日下午七時半之話劇義演，爲示普天同慶起見，照原售票價減半發售，當天上午十時起售票，觀者欲觀[海葬]者，毌失良機。</p>

<p>中國廣播協會自十月後，無綫電收聽費每月增爲一百元，較半年前原有每月三十元漲三倍有餘。按此項收聽費原爲國家戰時稅收之一，凡執有收音機者自當納稅無疑，唯此次突然猛漲，與去歲十月份第一次徵收無綫電收聽費時每月十元相較，竟有十與一之比。　　考無綫電在上海，原爲極普遍而所費又極低廉之娛樂器具；實則文化先進國家對此已視爲每家所必有如床桌椅然；且又具有報道新聞，教育及娛樂等義，頗爲政府所鼓勵提倡。而今廣播協會對此高增收聽費，吾輩小民將不能再聆聽或具有此最廉之娛樂教育器具焉。查去歲每月十元，爲數尚小，雖以筆者五燈機每日平均僅聽三小時，每月計電費六七元，而收聽費已爲十元，然而時隔一年，在用電量竭力縮減下，收音機之收聽時間減少，此爲每家具有機者所必然，即設以每日仍開聽三小時，每月計電費三十一元五角（以九月電費算），而收聽費則須百元。況此時此地何能每日暢開收聽而不顧電源將有斷絕之虞耶？一旦收聽費高漲，若即停止收聽，又須將機件拆除，並呈廣播協會騐核許可，則一變而爲廢物矣。且以後欲出讓亦不爲人所需欲，如是則擱置不聽爲不可能，且入擱易壞；如立即出讓，際此節電之時，欲購者究有幾人？況如筆者之機，舊而又收音不良，出賣則不值錢，棄廢之又可惜。　　因爲上述原因，用敢斗膽懇請廣播協會，能垂鑒升斗小民之有限娛樂與教育，及國家設廣播電台之初衷計，盡可能維持原收聽費價，則小民幸甚，國家廣播事業幸甚。</p>

<h3>近來的青年（二）</h3>
<p>際此皇國非常之秋，卑職得一死所，實榮幸之至，謹向天皇陛下高呼萬歲。　　二十又三年之間，蒙先父老母以及家族之恩澤，更受小中學各位導師，以及海軍教官與上司之指導教誨，實感謝莫銘。　　對於同艦之下畑兵曹遺族，唯有表示悲憫之意。　　最後應聲明者，皇恩未報於萬一而身先死，實令人遺恨萬年——　　（這眞像眞人的心境，眞像眞人的遺囑。）　　隆夫左一遍右一遍地讀報紙上刮登着的縮寫筆跡。　　在心坎中念念不忘聖恩，親恩，師恩，固屬家鄉良風，但由眞人的筆尖裹流露出來，一個字一個字地似乎變成溫柔而文雅的聲音，傳播到隆夫的耳朶裹。　　即是對部下下畑兵曹的關心，隆夫也的確感覺到這是眞人的氣味。在八幡校和二中時代，眞人總像親哥哥一樣的少年。隆夫自己雖然是同班，但始終覺着是弟弟。對於愛自己的弟弟，也並不是完全一樣的。呵，是的，在吳鎭水交社吃飯時，眞人瞇膖着眼睛講在坂下會遇見的部下。　　（那末，那個下士官不就是下畑兵曹麼？）　　隆夫雖然聽想到這一點，但毫無證據可以證明。　　隆夫立刻又想在佐久間艇長的一部份公開遺囑了。　　勿使我部下之遺族，忍飢受餓——艇長的意旨，豈不是完全活現於眞人的遺囑裹了麼？　　或許眞人寫遺囑時，會意識到佐久間艇長。但相隔三十二年的歲月，由於同樣的心境由於同樣的水底軍人，而結成一氣了。　　（這一定是傳說吧！）　　隆夫肅然起敬了。海軍軍人相互傳遞着，相互繼承着，這樣無形的，眼看不見的傳說。（一四九）</p>

<h3>當前的教育革新問題</h3>
<p>— 謝藥壽</p>
<p>近來各界助學金的贊助，十分踴躍，足見一般人士對於教育的重要，都有很清晰的觀念，但在一方面，卻有不少有識之士，於現行教育深致不滿，以爲如此教育足以亡國，這話未免過於憤激，不是說教育是不好的，毌寗說現在的學校教育和教育的本旨遠離罷了！一般人民對於學校的缺點，多歸　於校舍的隘陋，經費的不足，儀器設備的不完全，這都是限於環境所致，尚不是當前教育的根本　結，至於廢除文商各科，縮短修業年限，不過是非常時期的臨時辦法，並非萬年樹人的大計，所以從枝葉上說來，未免太嚕嘛了！我們且略去枝葉發覺他根本的　結罷！　　現在一般學校的基本缺點，一言以蔽之，便是[德育的忽略]，在學校方面，好像只要將智識灌輸給學生，便算了事，至於學生的品行思想便不關已事，在學生方面，也以爲到學校來唯一的目的是求智識，能夠將各種智識都接受不漏，便算好學生了！至於人生應當怎樣他們不但以爲不重要，而且根本就沒有考慮到這問題，正如無舵之舟，在波濤光湧的大海中，不知向何處行駛這是多麼危險啊！而且學校是訓練公民的所在，在學校中糊塗過去，那麼社會怎會有優秀的公民呢？學校不負這責任，該誰來負這責任呢！其實德育智育體育羣育，這樣並立看待，已是不妥：德育是一切的基本，德育即是智育體育羣育的正當發展著，並不是除了智育等以外另有德育，也不是除了德育而可以另有智育體育羣育等。荀子說：[弓調而後求勁焉，馬服而後求良焉，士必愨而後智能焉，不愨而多能，譬之豺狼不可近。]擅於千方百計欺詐剝削的，何嘗沒有智育？沿路襲刦，做沒本錢生意的，何嘗沒有體育？結黨營私，串通舞弊的，何嘗沒有羣育？沒有德育，才能越大，作惡的本領也越大，正是如傳翼虎。一般人聽得德育二字，便笑爲迂腐，其實他們何嘗眞知德育的重要。就一般學校忽略德育的結果，其害最大的約有以下數點　　我們來考察一般學生求學的目的，只想騙張文憑的固不足道，就是比較優秀的，也不過說，學一技之長，以爲將來立足社會之用。其實這也是私意，他們根本不知人生的目的，只是想爲自己謀利益。為什麼要讀理工叫？因爲研究理工的人才缺乏，將來謀生便利。爲什麼要讀文商呢？因爲文商的課程容易，混一個頭銜，唾手可得。功利主義，在一般學生頭腦中印象很深，即使將來對於社會有些貢獻，仍是基於謀利益的動機而成。所以對於課程，時常埋怨理論太多，不切實用，在他們的意見，自以爲不蹈空虛；不知實用是理論的應用於實際，不知理論，怎樣實用呢？現在一般學生的不合實用，不是他們只是理論，而是他們不能澈底了解理論。程子說：[眞知然後能行]。中山先生知難行易中很清晣地指出理論的重要，所以實用是根據理論而來，外理論便沒有實用。而且現在世界是多方面的，一技之長，斷不能應付，以爲讀理工的便不可知經濟，讀政治的便可不問歷史，完全是不對。現在一般所謂實用，其實不過是貪小務速，圖目前的利益，謀個人的享受，何嘗眞有[開物成務][立人達人]的志趣！尚利貪小便是當前教育的一大缺點　　因爲求學的動機出於尚利，因此課程方面祗求敷衍得過，一字一句的錄著筆記，至於課程以外，教師所不講的，便都不管。到了考試，一齊都緊張得很，當做一件了不得的大事，要求教師指定範圍，上次考過的不要考，拚命地開夜車，強記硬背，希望能有八十分九十分的成績，這還是所謂用功的；不用功的便想盡種種舞弊的方法，希望這次能徼幸及格。無論用功或不用功，都著眼在分數上，根本不會考慮所讀的課程和我究有什麼關係。作弊的固不必說，就是號爲用功的，把考試和平日分做兩截看，又何嘗不是作僞？所以一經考試，所學的已有大半遺忘了！在他們也覺得已經考試，目的已經達到，該是遺忘的時候了。在教師[與人方便]的，便指定所謂[重要]處，於是學生對於指定範圍以外的；自然不去溫習了！在教師自以爲嚴格的，便故意在書針縫內挖出微小無關大體的問題來難學生，在學生也竭力記誦許多可有可無的答案來迎合教師的用意，上下相猜，逆億其心，把重要的主旨反忽略了！孔子說：[古之學者爲已]，不知現在的學生是否爲已而學！學生這種行爲，學校方面也該負相當責任，平日上課，視爲無關緊要，一到學期結束，便大吹大擂的佈告着：某日將大考，諸生應加努力，在教師也一連串地告誡學生，現在該用功了，這話很是可笑，祗有臨考時用功，那麼平時可不用功嗎？倘使平時用功，到了考試，不過[舉爾所知]，何等簡易！何必努力！惟其校方以此爲大事，學生也隨之以爲大事，那麼學生的作僞，不是校方所誘成的嗎？而且一至考試，互相拼命爭成績的優劣，本是要好的朋友，也心懷嫉忌，不肯互相討論，惟恐其人成績超出自己。假使名利前茅，有特別獎勵的話，那麼競爭更劇烈了！成績相上下的同學，眞成仇人相似，學校本是教人禮讓恭遜，有了考試，不是反誘人爭奪嗎？而且在考試時，所謂嚴格的學校，便排定座位，騐對照片，四角都派人監視，虎視眈眈，好像在室考試的，個個都是存心來舞弊的，這是多麼輕蔑他人的自重心啊！其實校方如發覺有人舞弊，便表示其教導無方，不能謀澈底根絕的辦法，怎麼可以以捉出舞弊，自誇爲嚴格管理呢！從前科舉時代，應該時有具保搜檢等限止，有志之士都以爲以盜賊待士，寗不去考試，怎麼到現在還保守著以盜賊待士的陋習呢？樣方儘管說不許舞弊，不許代考，假使不能注重平日課程而過分誇張考試，這結果是不能免的！平晶茍且敷衍，臨時方急去用功，這不是自欺嗎？還不是作弊嗎？將臨時抱佛腳的我，代替平時不用功的我，還不是代考嗎？青年是國家未來的主人翁，不知將負擔怎大的責任，遇到考試一件小事，便緊張得手足無措，怎樣能[廻狂瀾於旣　]呢？在幼不知自重，不能自信，忍受考試時輕蔑的待遇，只冀能微幸及格，怎樣能[獨立不懼，遯世旡悶]呢？平時敷衍，考試時求微幸，又是當前教育的一大缺點。　　一個生長在鄉野的人，始覺鄉野的可愛，生小在都市中，是不會有這種感覺的，所以對於本國文化，有深切的研究，不期而然深愛着本國，而且社會是由無數年的歷史積累而成，不知以前的文化，便不能瞭解今日的社會，可是現在的教育，顯然是不注重此點，好像過去的一切，都是無用的，空虛的，對國外的文化儘是注重，對於本國文化反不知道，未免本末顚倒罷！一般學生知道莎士比亞和狄更司，但說到湯顯祖和曹雪芹，卻不知道了！知道康德和黑格爾，但說到程伊川和陸象山，卻不知道了！在他們的想像中，似乎中國在一二百年前，尚在石器時代，一切都不開化，沒有一些兒文化值得注意，這種態度，到處可以覺到。社會上一切儀節，在西洋應該怎樣怎樣，是都知道的，並且是模彷着，但是依中國昔聖的意見應該怎樣，卻模糊不知了。一篇談話，有意無意地總要夾雜幾個英文，好像不如此不足以表示巳受過高等教育。這種情形，我們即使不深文周內說他將要怎樣，但就[不注意]這一點來說，總不是好現象罷！不知本國文化，又是當前教育的一大缺點　　人事是互相關連的，所以一切學識，都密切地或較疏遠地互相關連着，絕對沒有兩科是毫無關係的，所謂活用，就是能發覺各科間的關係及對於人生的關係，所謂死讀書，就是將各　科目都對立起來，不相來往，各科間尚且不知旁通，對於人生的關係，更是隔絕了，所以求學和人生截然分爲兩事，而求學中又截然分成幾種科目，這樣的學問，有什麼用呢？隨便舉一個例罷柏拉圖在他學園大門上佈告着：[凡不會學習歐凡里的幾何，不准入內。]數學對於哲學文學美術等等有什麼關係呢？這是因爲學習數學的基本目的，並不單在能夠計算，計算毌寗說是次要的，最重要的還在訓練人類分析和演繹的能力。但是現在一般學生，都只以爲能將每問習題演算出，便算了不得，至於處理人事，就茫無頭緒，無從下手，不知何處是主要點，何處是次要點，怎樣將他分析，並怎樣去處理他；這種情形，是最易遇到的，他們都怨學校不會教導到，其實學校是不會教導到，即使要教導，也是事實上不可能，人事隨時變異，沒有二件絕對相同的，那麼怎樣可以預先講定格套辦法呢？但只要有分析事物的能力，怕還不能處理他嗎？這種情形，又是尚利的結果，不能篤實切巳以求自得，只知求智識而不知對於人生的關係，又是當前教育的一大缺點。　　以上總括說來，種種缺點，只是因爲德育的忽略罷了！一般人說：[社會是一只大染缸，許多純潔的青年都被他染壞了！]道話不錯，不過學校本身已是一只小染缸，種種痛痛，種種過失，那一件不是在學校中隱隱釀成的，平日只知爲利而讀書，將來自然[乞墦][登龒]，[枉尺直尋]，怎樣能[見得思義][臨財毌茍]呢？平日只求敷衍得過，將來自然遇事茍且，因循怠緩，怎樣能[鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已]呢？遇到考試般小事，尚且驚惶失措，徼幸及格，將來自然[患得患失]，[同流合污]，怎樣能[中立不倚][任重道遠]呢？讀書用功，本是分內事，但爲了分類獎金而互相爭勝，將來自然不安素履，矜勢逞能，怎樣能[澹泊明志，寗靜至遠]呢？平日不知本國文化，將來自然醉心異族，[毀冠裂冕]，怎樣能[復我邦家][與子同仇]呢？平日將讀書和人生分成兩截，不相眞通，將來自然中無定主，與俗浮沉，怎樣能辦析義利，明察是非呢？正因爲所受的教育是如此，一旦投入社會，便愈積愈深，以至本心全失，所以忽略德育的結果；偏重理論的，造成新式的書獃子；偏重實用的，造成文明的剝削者；教育媽虎的，造成　預的蠢蟲；教育嚴格的，造成精明的市價，這樣的教育，未免令人短氣，朱子說：[朝廷若要恢復中原，須要罷三十年科舉始得！]若要爲當前社會謀澄本清源的辦法，那麼教育制度眞該澈底加以革新！　　談到革新的方法，可分以下數點：　　一學生的學業，大半依於教師的教導，一個優良的教師，除了超越的學識外，並須有自願教育的熱心，假使無意教導，只求敷衍得過，即使學識豐富，有什麼用呢？所以嚴擇師資是革新教育的第一步，擇師旣定，並當提高待遇，不但可使久於其任，在尊師之道也當如此，那麼教師可以[循循善誘]，學生可以[拳拳服膺]，較之教師時時改動，其效率自增高不少，現在一般的就職業，多是說糊口飯吃，但在教育界就絕對不能如此，在他業尚是情有可原，倘使教師也以糊口爲先，結果必將敷衍了事，自己對於課程，未嘗有深切的研究，便來教導學生，自欺欺人，簡直是大惡不赦。　　二新生入學，應從嚴格審樛，寗可數額不足，不可過分濫收，降低教育的水準，這樣或許另外引起經費不足等問題，但這是教育本身以外的事，姑不詳論，現在一般的情形，優秀的學生往往因清寒而不能繼續學業，能夠繼續學業的，又多自暴自棄而不肯上進，助學金的設立，多少總解決了前一個問題，而後一個問題，也未嘗不急待解決，教育的目標，與其數量的增多，還不如品質的提高；寗可使受教育的人較少，而使凡受教育的都能擔任國家將來的棟樑，切不可使驕化分子與優秀的同受高等教育，反致影響士氣的不振。　　三師生的選擇旣定，教育便開始了。學校的責任是在訓練優秀的公民，並不是只傳授些智識，使人如機器一般，或是怎樣謀生，去學作市儈。所以修身正心，便是教育的要務，一般學校都有校訓校規堂皇地揭示着，但是學生能遵守的有幾，不過當作官樣文章罷了！即使上課時，仍有謔浪笑傲的聲音存在，學校中有校規，尚不能遵守，社會上沒有一般普遍的規則，就難怪行爲沒有紀律了！近年多數學校重行讀經，其實這也大可不必，讀而不行，一隻耳朶進，一隻耳朶出，眞孔子所謂吾末如之何也已矣。張禹孔光劉　馬融何嘗不是赫赫大名的經學家呢？所以讀經可以不必，但是日常學生的舉動，無論在課內課外，時時加以勸導，加以禁止，卻是必需的。　　四講到學校制度的改革，第一是考試制度必須廢除；即是積重難返，一時不能驟革，亦當將考試稍有輕視，而多注重於日常成績，其實在平日問答中已可將該生的所學決定，何以要到考試，要到考試才能定學生的優劣，那麼這教師也顢預極了!有人以爲考試是學校　督學生的惟一辦法，一旦廢止，必致倫　而不肯努力，這話似是而非，一切事物只怕沒有興趣，不怕他不努力。知之則必好之，好之則必樂之，只是一件事。嚴格審核學生的入學，自沒有偷懶騙文憑的混入；有優良教師的諄諄教誨，對課程自有莫大的興趣，怎會倫懶不去研究自己有莫大興趣的事物呢？　使根本沒有興趣，用考試強迫他用功，不是教人作僞自欺嗎？這樣的用功，恐將得不償失罷！　　五學業年限多有規定，固足以避免　等之弊，但各人天資不同，一槪律之於此，未免使天資高的，不能充分發展其個性，而天資低的，又苦於過於強迫。所以年限方面，最好能稍有伸縮，務使天資的高低，都能盡量發展，不受強迫之苦。而且還有一層，現在的教育制度，除了愚頑不堪以外，達到一定年限，都可畢業，在學生方面，不知眞能澈底了解呢？還是敷衍及格呢？這是一個大疑問，有人說：現在的教育眞和從前捐官相似，祗要繳足學費，過了一定期限，便有文憑到手。不知一般以敷衍及格爲目的的，對此有何感想。　　六一般教師教授的方法，大都是趨向記憶，教學生死讀背誦，這種教師以爲只要塡鴨式的塡足，至於有利有弊，就不管了。在於學生，也只知拚命背誦，至於書中的要旨，反茫然不曉，陽明王子說：[若徒要記得，便不曉得]。眞是不錯，而且有的教師，到了考試，呌學生直照書本上一字不漏的默出來，漏一字便扣幾分，這是默書，何嘗是學問，何嘗是在人在讀書，不是書被人讀，到是人被書役了！所以今後革新的方法，應使教師們都用討論的方法，使學生自悟自得，狀成分析事物的能力，不專重於記憶字句。　　以上所論，都是擇其最重要的，至於其他瑣細的問題，一時也不暇細舉，只要根本上的缺點矯正，其他都可迎刃而解，不必細論。程子說：[若從事而方，不救則已；若須救之，必須變，大變則大益，小變則小益。]教育的重要，旣家喻戶曉，不待詳言，今日教育的缺點，又如此明顯，那麼怎樣革新教育，正待當前莫大的努力，斷不可因爲手續麻煩，積重難返，就此因循過去！</p>

<p>國家的所以會有強弱，民族的所以會有興衰，考察牠的原因，固然很多，可是教育辦理得完善與否，學校設立得普遍與否，實在是挺好的指南針，試金石。吾國自古以來，對於教育，非常注重，如孔門設教分爲禮樂射御數書六門，孟子所謂[謹庠序之教，申之以孝悌之義]所以在春秋戰國時代，人材輩出，一時稱盛，漢代以來，以通五經或以賢良方正取士，唐代以來，以科舉取士，方式雖略有變化，可是注重教化則一，使士來擔負國家重任則一。所可惜的祗知注重義理章句，不知研究實學，而且把鍛鍊身體的射御兩字，也置之腦後，所以數千年來，文化工商，均沒有長足發展，而停頓在中途。迨到清朝末季，海禁大開，歐美各國，挾其堅強甲兵，精美製品，侵略傾銷，同時並進，有如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，而我國原來所辦教育的缺點，至此暴露無遺，不得不大加改良，以期適應環境，所以當時重臣如會文正公園藩李文忠公鴻章等，先後派遺留學生，分赴各國，研究科學。稍後張文襄公之洞，更創[中學爲體，西學爲用]之說，希望能轉融會貫通，而卓然有所樹立，昔日流行的科舉，毅然廢掩了，適合潮流的學校，紛紛創立了，屈指計算，已有不到百年的歷史，雖然規模粗具，可是語其成績，仍雖距離理想很遠，尤其以最近數年來，綱紀失墜，學岡泄沓，一切情，更有江河日下之感，今試列其重要的病態於後：　　一從學校方面講　自從事變發生以來，各地的人民，紛紛搬來上海，學校也難例外，而且同爲時會的變遷，機緣的輻湊，新興學校，也如雨後春荀，所以上海學校之多，有如過江之鎯，尤其以中小學爲甚，可是究其內容，大都因簡就陋，專從生意眼着想的居多，至於教學認眞，設備完善的，可說十不得一，如理化的實騐，非有充足的儀器機械和實騐至不可，社會科學的研究，非有豐富的參考書籍和廣大的圖書館不可。可是舊的或者燬於兵燹，或者早經損壞，復因來源的斷絕和費用的昂貴，補充不易實現。再則因爲物價的高翔，開銷的日增，爲維持教師的生活，和學校的支出，對於學雜費的徵收，自然水漲船高，成爲等比而上升。可是學雜費一貴，來校的學生，也要受相當影響，爲招徠計，不得不委曲求全，於學生以種種便利，而轉校越級和出賣文憑的風氣，隨之展開，此外如教室的容量，超過規定人數，運動塲的設備，付諸缺如，學校經濟的不公開，和投機漁利之盛行，可說是當前教育病態之一。　　二從教師方面講　吾國教師，可說收入菲薄，而責任重大，此在平時已然，而在今日尤甚。受了高物價政策的影響，一般教師們，爲了家庭開支的重擔，壓迫得喘不過氣來的，可說十居八九，能夠維持一家生活的，百不得一二，可是日子不能不過肚皮不能不飽，在無可設法之中，祗有增加授課鐘點，藉資挹註；本校不足者，取償於他校，因之一週擔任課三十餘點鐘，奔波四五校的，可說晉通的很，不但中小學教師如此，就是大學教授，也有類似的情形。可是個人的精神，不是無窮的，擅長的學科，亦是有限的；由於擔任的鐘點一多，講解不免鬆懈，改卷更無心緒，在學生方面說，得益不免減少，但是在教師方面說，已奔波得滿頭大汗，精疲力盡，回家之後，便要早些休息，決無研究學問的時間和勇氣。可是學問如逆水行舟，不進則退，何況世界潮流，常在動盪進化之中，如其不能迎頭趕上，就要成爲時代的落伍者，可說是當前教育病態之二。　　三從學生方面講　學生是國家未來的主人翁，關係何等的重大，在校求學時，更應如何的凝神壹志，必勤必奮，鍛鍊體格，研習學科，以期多所貢獻於國家。可是我國的科學，本來是落伍的，而年來因爲生活杌隍，度日維艱，一般家長們，爲了開門七件事，已經我覺到山窮水盡，焦頭燦額，對於兒女的教育費，除了少數例外，大都可說心餘力拙，愛莫能助，何況學費還在一天天的增加呢，所以學生的人數，一天天地在減少着，大學不必說，中小學的情形，也是如此，這一危機，何等的深刻呀！不但如此，而且在校的學生，眞能爲讀書而讀書的，可說是鳳毛麟角；窮的呢，大部份爲家務分心，富的呢爲戀愛屈膝，視學校爲裝飾，爲頭銜，祗求早些畢業，便可在社會上混飯呢。所以轉校越級，和買文憑的風氣，大盛而特盛。程度的水準，更是急遽地下寶塔甚至甲校不及格的學生，到乙校去反升了兩級，高中未畢業的學生，讀大學的很多很多。此就學校方面說，爲了應付環境，爲了增裕收入，本月不得已有苦衷。再就學生方面說，利用時機，早得資格，亦不可厚非，可是就國家立塲說，一般學生的知識水準，日趨低下，如何能夠擔當建設國家，復興國家的大任，再就社會立塲說，此等風氣一開，亦足以發生不良影響，而減少對於學校的信仰，可說是當前教育病態之三。　　四從國家方面講　發展教育，造就人材，本來是國家的專責，所以列強對於教育經費，都寬爲籌撥，對於掃除文盲，亦積極的進行。學校的經費，旣然相當寬裕，設備也相當完善，所以能獲得社會的信仰，而發生良好的功效。教師的收入，旣然豐富，生活亦相當定定，所以可不見異思遷，而視爲終身職業。我國平時對於教育經費，並不重視，何況今日戎馬倥惚，軍書旁午的當兒，教育經費的不能寬籌，可說是無足爲怪的了！因之除了國立或公立學校以外，教育主管機關，與學校當局，可說不生聯繫，昔日的津貼，早經取銷了，名義式的視察，等於具文了，雙方有如風馬牛之漠不相關，不但如此，教育主管機關就是對於國立或公立等校，也因經費的支絀，営肯發出不敷開支，或欠發數月的情事，由於教費的支絀，對於學校的監費，也就難於嚴格，一切的所以不上軌道，所以日趨腐敗，可說事有必至，勢有必然的，可說是當前教育病態之四。　　根據上述，可知我國當前教育的病態，原因甚多，而且互相循環，互爲困果，以致造成今日的局面，而我國教育所以能夠維持不墜者，可說是社會上熱心人士扶助之力。如申報館的助學金，新聞報館的貸學金，和叔蘋公的獎學金，尤負盛名，他們或者請社會上有力和熱心人士捐助，或者自行出資，都屬辦理完善，聲譽卓著。聞風而起的，有廣東，湖北，常州，紹興等同鄉會的助學金，受助的學生，無慮數萬人，實在是一椿應該大書而特書的盛舉。所可惜的此類助學金的設立，祇能督導學生，以學生成績的優劣，爲取錄與否的標準，至於學校和教師，均非所問，未免有偏於一隅之感，再則由於金額的限制，要想掃除文盲，要想普及教育，仍有無能爲力之苦。所以筆者不敏，略舉幾項重要調整方式於下：　　一教育當局應當負責的，可分爲九點如次：（一）應當寬籌教育經費，使從事教育的，可以不受生活壓迫而得專心教育。轉入特刋第二版</p>

<h3>目前的教育革新問題我見</h3>
<p>— 朱佐才</p>
<p>欲談什麼是當前的教育問題，必先認識教育的目標是什麼？說起教育目標，自古到今，中外教育家，皆有其說，受字數限制，不便一一引荐，茲就學校系統中，地處中樞，承上啓下的中學校之訓練目標，爲我們檢討當前教育問題之參考：一，鍛鍊強健體格。二，陶冶公民道德。三，培養民族文化。四，充實生物活知能。五，培植科學基礎，六，養成勞動習慣。七啓發藝術興趣。以上七條，雖然對社會，對個人，對物質，對文化，對道德，知識，技能，對語文，科學，藝術，無不具備。但歸納起來，可分康健，職業，公民，休閒四類，康健，包含生命和健康之保持；職業，包含利用文明生活中之工具，符號以及其他實際業務上所需的特殊技能，謀工作效能之增進；公民，包含個人對於社會的制裁和協調，與團體活動的合作與參加；休閒，包含利用閒暇，使生活向上而豐富。教育的目標，旣然如是，那麼，今日的教育，今日上海的一般教育情形是怎麼樣呢？學校中康健教育，職業訓練，公民教育，休閒活動訓練，實施到如何程度？無可諱言的，大都學校，因爲設備簡陋，校舍不合標準，教師資格欠缺，辦學精神，不振，教學興趣不良，使教育效率減低，甚至獲得了反效果，很像病人請了庸醫，吃錯了藥劑，不但沒有把病症治好，反而加深了病勢，或傳變成無可救藥的絕症。那麼這些責任，全在辦學的當事人和教師們的身上嗎？不！不能把所有的責任。全歸罪在教師身上，負起這大部份責任的，還在社會的各份子和負有教育行政責任的當局，教師不過是負有實際工作的責任而巳，很像造屋的泥水匠，木匠，漆匠和小工，試問祗有匠工，赤手空拳，就能造成高樓大厦嗎？再就另一方面言，上海以及其他各地，所有的學齡兒童，是否都有求學的機會？假使不把百分之八十的文盲掃除，試問少數的士大夫，可以救國興邦嗎？以上種種，乾脆言之，問題在[經濟]，教育經費問題，決非少數慈善家所能普遍解決，必須全社會每個人，對於教育，都熱忱相待，握有教育行政權的政府當局，也該爲教育經費，鼎力籌措，努力推進，並負起監督領導責任，那麼，無往而不利。　　教育事業，旣然是國家興隆，民族生存的基業，那麼教育事業，應該由國家直接經營，通盤籌劃，俾達到整齊劃一的預期效果，私人辦學，總免不了散漫，鬆懈，各自爲政，以致造成惹人觸目驚心的商店化局面。　　上海是全國第一大都市，居經濟，文化的中心，雖然在這戰事狀態之下，仍不失其地位，從事實上推究，以上海人才之衆，財力之富，致力教育，何難達到理想目標？茲謹以赤誠之心，就事論事，有所建議於後，而後革新當前教育者之參考。　　一，添設公立學校就上海之大，人口之衆，以原有公立學校學生數，與於市學生數相較，大相懸殊，故於目前情形之下，若不能普遍設立，亦該選擇適當地段，添設公立學校，此等學校，不論在教學方法上，學校行政上，學校設備上，訓育實施上，爲各該地區，各該級私立學校之模範，學費雜費，一律免收。校長爲一校之首，對於一校之興廢成敗有關，故校長人選，宜鄭重遴拔，非具有服務精神，實際教育經騐者，不可充任。　　二，整頓私立學校因爲公立學校稀少，爲了社會的需要，私立學校，應運而生，使學齡兒童，有求學的塲所，國家基業，得以繼續，這應該歸功於許多熱心教育之私立學校主辦人。然而時至今日，眞正爲教育而教育者，果然大有人在，當教育爲企業，藉獲利潤，驟然致富者，亦在不少。且有不少學校，校舍狹窄，空氣污濁，光綫黑暗，設備簡陋，影響學生健康；師資低劣，精神不足，影響學生學業與性格，校董會有名而無實，經費全仗學費而又不公開支配；學生太少，則複式教學；學生太多，一堂濟濟，亦不顧及教師之精力幾何？學生之可否得益？凡此種種，難免誤人子弟，摧殘國家棟梁之事實，豈可不加整頓，再誤於將來？整頓之法，應先確定整頓原則，優良學校，明令嘉獎，腐敗學校，應予取締，或令改善。　　三，栽培教育人才所謂教育人才，一爲教育人員之栽培，負督導教育發展之責，以各大學之教育院系，畢業生，而且於修業前後，會參加教學實際工作若干年者，或師範畢業生，有五年以上教育經騐，再受過短期訓練者，最爲適當，而爲教育行政幹部人員。一爲直接負教育責任之教師。中學教師除學有專長外，應受教育課程陶養，對於教育原理，教育哲學，中等教育，以及各種心理學，教材，教法，有充分之認識。至於原有中學教師，利用假期，或自修辦法，以資修進。小學教師，以受過師範訓練者爲原則，目前師資，感覺缺乏，應增設師範學校，或擴充學級，並就原任教師中之非師範畢業生，實行有試騐檢定，去蕪存精。初級教師，利用初中畢業之優等生，受一年之師資訓練，（簡師辦法）充任之。師範生一切生活費用，全由學校供給，以示優待。師資訓練，除養成教學技能外，訓育方法，亦爲重要，即教師本身之學行修養，一律注意，以造成優良之師表。時代是前進的，學問無止境的，原有教師之進修，予以輔助與鼓勵，如有志深造，工讀並行之教師，予以種種便利與帮助。　　四，安定教師生活教師生活，向稱清苦，時至今日，清中更清，苦中更苦，無怪有不少教師，受生活之煎熬，拋棄了粉筆，另謀發展。其有堅定不移者，有的生活上還能勉強維持，對於教育工作，特別感覺興趣，有的單身漢，只需自顧自，有的欲做生意，做單帮，沒有資本，投奔別業無引薦。脫不下來，要顧而子。但是我們須得注意，在薪水半年一加，物價日長夜大的局面下，教師的生活，再清苦下去，原能勉強維持生活的教師，總有不能再維持下去的一天；對於教育工作特具興趣的教師，也難枵腹從公；單身漢也得有成家的一天，至於布長衫不得不脫，而子不得不顧及的時候，也會走出校門，另外謀生。到那時，再有誰願意進師範學校，做準備改行的師範生叱？到那時擔負教育重任的是那一種人？當然是一般庸碌無能的鬥外漢，濫竽充數了。教育事業，走上如何地步，不難可想而知。別說將來，即就現實而論，未經師資訓練，沒有教學能力，充當教師者，日見增多，這不是一大危機嗎？欲求教師精神振作，對於教育工作，發生興趣，增強教育效能，非先安定教師生活不可。[清高][神聖][萬歲]等高帽子，再也戴不上挨凍挨餓，精明幹練的教師門的頭上，安定教師生活的具體辦法，就管見所及，陳述於後：　　甲·提高薪給標準公立學校，應按照生活指數，逐月計算。私立學校，一律經濟公開，按照學校總收百分之七十以上，充作全校教職員薪水，薪給標準，須按照課務之多寡，職務之繁簡，分等列級，其最大差額，不得超過最低薪百分之五十。中學之行分鐘制者，以每周二十四節爲一個專任教員計算。　　乙·學校供給教師住宿　教師住校，可以減少路途上時間之浪費，車資之浪費，同時對於校務與課務之處理，旣安心，又方便，環境又純潔，共同進修，又獲集思廣益之妙，教師住宿問題得以解決，其於教育效率上，必增多不少。　　丙·日需品之特種配給　教師爲公衆服務，爲國家效勞，其待遇應與普通公務員同。當此實行戰時統制經濟政策的時候，政府應予每一教師，及其直系親屬，按照實際消耗量，配給日常生活必需品，如米·（特種配米，當局正在着手進行中）煤球·油·鹽·糖·衣料之類，以減少生活上之憂慮，那麼，教師不致再在教室中，老是想着家中的柴火問題。　　丁·豁免自警團之服役　保甲組織，乃在保障地方安寗，自警團服役年齡之青年，應有服役之義務，共謀地方安寗，可是教師之教導兒童，責職重大，工作繁重，課餘之暇，又須批改課卷，處理雜務，故應一律優待，准予免役。　　五·補助私校經費經費十分寬裕之學校，自無補助之必要，然大多私校，經費拮据，以致一切簡陋，無力舉力，應斟酌情形，給與種種補助，務使若干教育之學校，不再永立於風雨飄搖之地位，而遭遇中途而廢，或影響教育精神及學生身心發展　　六·扶植清寒學子言之過早。可是我們也有辦法，扶植清寒學子，例如指令各級私立學校設免費額半費額百分之幾，免除學費，由政府供新聞或將勵各公團體，分別負担；或指定較完善私校，專招免費生或半費生，一切經費，由政府按照公立學校經費撥給。（即前代用辦法）在此等清寒學子之中，如有特殊優秀學生，除令修完初等教育外，再由公費升入中學大學。　　七·獎勵私人興學教育原以國家直接經營爲最妥，當今經濟無力全部舉辦時，社會人士，應負有羣策羣力之責任，使每個學齡兒童，都有受教育的機會。對於捐資興學者，政府應該多多獎勵，或記之於冊籍，或樹之以碑像，或贈之以物品，作爲紀念，或揚名於當世，使社會上，造成私人捐資興學的風氣。各公團體，捐資興學者，同例褒獎。　　八·廣設義務學校義務學校，除一切費用，完全不收外，並供給書籍文具。此種學校，書寫與計算，爲最重要之課程，（即三Rs主義），故其上課，以半日制，最爲適當，俾合經濟原則。招收學生，以貧苦兒童，無力自費求學，且必須輔助學務，或有固定職業，或營小本買賣者爲對象。於是一般向來被摒棄於校門以外之不幸兒童，亦可同樣獲得求學機會。　　九·重視健康教育[偉大之事業，寓於健全之體格]；[欲強國先強種]；健康是幸福的要素]。這些都是至理名言，我們旣然明白健康的重要，對於健康教育，應多多注意，其注意程度之深，應在學業之上。試問各校行政，除注重課業之外，對於學生健康，有否注意？我們不能再令學生關在教室裹死讀書，健康設備，應多多舉辦，有礙學生健康的環境，應當一一改善。市立公共體育塲也得多多開闢。至於有利於身心之休閒活動，亦宜多多提倡，藉此替代不正當之娛樂。　　十·增強視導制度學校與行政當局之發生連繫，緊密合作，應由擔任視導工作之督學，負其全責，督學之視導，負有積極性之建設，與消極性之改善，教育效率之推進，端賴督學視導工作之如何而定，故教育行政當局，對於督學之視導制度，重視而增強之。更因視導工作之重大，督學人選，非具有服務精神，五年以上實際教學經騐，成績優良，思想新穎者不可。若行督學區制，對於教力·訓育·總務·健康，有專職視導，尤爲妥善。</p>

<p>戰爭已到決勝階段，政治力量強化成爲現在刻不容緩的急務。勝利政治惟一特點，就是政府之一切設施均能深得民心，以樹立卓然威信。在平時政府的存在對於發展國家的經濟有很大作用，舉凡財富的生產，分配，消費和交換都受政府的關係。因爲政府的治安職務能維護社會的正義與安寗，人民生命及財產得有保障，社會秩序得使安靜，凡此種種均爲生產所必需。爲使經濟生產增加，國家人民生活富裕在任何時均有鞏固地方治安的必要。國家處於戰時，地方治安更顯得其有重要地位。爲增強戰爭力量，堅定勝利信念，假使地方治安不能維持則人民必不能安居樂業，遑論其他；反之人民生活能因有良好治安而生活無憂，則人民對於政府必有特殊好感，政治基礎奚有不益發堅強。　　治安機構的維持需要龐大的經費，如經費不充沛行政効率無從講求。薪餉不能足額，最低限度的生活亦無法維持。以上海市而論，治安機構內包括公務員，警察和保安隊等服務人員，他們現在的待遇實在太微薄，雖然上海有警察合作社設立和特種配給之增加，但是生活依然無法解決，他們的生活不能有合理的調整，社會治安之前途殊堪憂慮，社會上敲詐，欺騙，勒索，浮收，中飽等歹事也不能絕跡。消極的三申五令，精神訓練，決不能阻止貪污政治的繼續。實行廉潔政治務本的辦法惟有解決他們的生活問題，就是使他們吃飽，他們吃飽以後，人民才能夠飽食。要使他們吃飽，必須增加他們的眞實收入，如此才能使他們負起治安的重任，人民的模範和表率亦可從此樹立。凡百經費的來源是收入，政府的主要收入是稅收。增加稅收可用增設新稅和增加舊稅率之方法。也可以用整頓舊稅的方法。整稅爲穩健的增加稅收辦法，旣不擾民，反能使稅收走上自肅，經濟和進步之途徑。治安經費的增加亦不外乎應用整稅和增稅。財政整頓以後，必可增加收入，充實經費，然後對於公務人員，警察，保安隊等之薪餉經費充份增加，務使生活安定。如果尚嫌不夠，寗願以增稅方法彌補。如何整稅和增稅略抒已見如下：　　一廢止包稅制度　　包稅制度之產生，原爲財務機構組織未臻完備而稅收不能放棄因是招人承包，實爲權宜之計，包稅制度本身存在着許多缺點，獲得承包權者往往對於稅務主管人員有着親戚或同鄉的關係，或者因善吹拍而鑽營得到，承包人當然完全以牟利眼光從時包稅，在徵稅時一面應用商人手段再能依靠特殊勢力徵收稅款，承包之數每差於實收數遠甚，故於政府之益處甚小。現在上海財政中最大缺憾是爲包稅制度的存在，爲健全稅制所不容許存在的。現在上海市財務機構，不呆算不健全，亟應採取統收辦法，以充裕上海市之收入。　　二防止違法逃稅　　違法逃稅爲逃稅的一種。逃稅者所獲利益，即爲政府所受損失，所以財務當局亟應防止違法漏稅。上海現行消費特稅爲商行自行解繳，時有逃稅情事發生，逃稅的主動者爲商人或消費者。商人爲招攬顧客對於消費者往往豁免其捐稅，有時商人爲貪利而隱報，更有商人與徵稅人員通同作弊而逃稅。能防止消費特稅的逃漏，亦可以增加上海市稅收，防止消費特稅方法爲一發行消費特況稅票二採用統一發票，再由財務機關能嚴查各商店之帳冊，如此能防止漏稅則商民亦知自檢，稅收亦不虞有缺。三廢除苛雜，整理由賦　　當政治混亂的時候，地方財政惟一特徵是苛捐雜稅的繁重，在近年中國農村受戰爭影響也增加了許多雜稅，田賦的繳納尚輕，而附加的各種雜稅實在使農民不勝負擔，雜稅的存在固然表示地方政治的腐敗，而且是一切禍亂之源，在上海市財政中，田賦的收入亦佔重要地位，但上海附近農村中之各種雜稅苛捐有鄉鎭費駐軍燃料供應費，軍警燈油費，駐軍菜貼，軍隊過境招待費，軍警米貼，警官制服費，防禦工事建築費，居住證費，眞是不勝枚舉。不但違反租稅的確定原則，而且是極度擾亂農村的經濟的，欲增加田賦的收入，必先廢除苛雜。關於田賦的整理，除應本一貫政策，加緊推行土地陳報土地測量登記治本治標兩種工作外，對於改訂科則調整稅率適合於現時社會經濟環境，尤爲重要。　　四澈底改革財務行政　　財務行政的改革與整個稅收有密切關係，現在上海財務行政有澈底改革的必要，表現得最明顯的是稅收人員的綱紀問題，認承認不需要改革，稅收人員之綱紀不過是財務行政之一環，如財務行政能澈底改革，則其他小問題均能迎刃而解，改革財務行政的重點在於人與錢的合理調整，和對於人與錢得有良好制度的樹立，樹立文官服務制度及公庫制度爲現在上海市財務行政機關必須做到的。　　第一，樹立文官服務制度：所謂制度，並非忽視人的條件。治人與治法，實應並重，缺一不可，關於文官制度的建立，目的在選拔優秀人才，執行事務，保障其生活安定，職位穩固，所有財務行政人員，縱令確屬眞才亦必爲劃出客觀標準，使其由考試訓練之道而來，服務之後，所有考績，　陟，保障，撫卹，俱爲之制定章則，使有客觀之標準，足資依據，所有人才之登庸不以人情爲出發，而以制度爲出發，不恃主觀的好惡而依客觀的標準。　　第二，樹立公庫制度，公庫制度的根本精神，即在收稅人員，不經手錢，應納稅款，經稽征機關調查核定之後，即由納稅人直接繳入國庫，我國有一句成語，[經手三分肥]就是做了官，只要經手鈔票，即使不貪污，也能落得手頭寬綽，沾些油水，假使厲行公庫制度，征收人員，旣不經手鈔票，根本就沒有中飽和肥潤的機會，稅收貪污，更無從做起。如果上海市政府能酌量情形，能夠普遍和完全實行公庫制度，則稅收的增加是有很大的把握。　　以上所述爲整稅方法，欲增加上海市財政收入，以上四項必須完全做到，關於增稅的方法有如下列所述。　　增加零售捐：零售捐爲消費稅之一種，，其收入較富有很大彈性，而且是非常普遍，故欲增稅莫善於增加零售捐，零售捐原有稅率爲百分之四，其中百分之二繳解中央，其餘百分之二爲地方收入，欲求上海地方治安經費增加，可將零售捐稅率提高至百分之六，其中百分之二完全充作地方治安經費，爲防止流用，可將其設置特殊的基金保管。　　欲求上海市成爲全國政治模範區，治安的維持是必須加強，欲加強治安必須增加治安經費，經費之措籌濤於整稅和增稅，今所論述，詳於整稅而簡於增稅，此非偏重一方，本人以爲先有整稅然後能設施增稅，否則舊稅依然不整，只圖增稅，人民負擔加重而稅收不會成合理的比例增加。</p>
<h3>增稅與征稅方法之檢討</h3>
<p>— 層雲</p>
<p>財也者兆民之所同欲，政事之所必需者也，誠能以民之財，治民之事，以大公之心，行一切之政，則政府與人民交利，而財用無不足，於豫計之數無所增，於實用之數不能濫，取之於民，布之於民，旣公且明，上下孕信，稽之先進諸國，莫不如是。假使輕稅薄賦，則國用必有不足。爲官吏者，終不能毀家以紓國，竭私以報公，究不得不仍取諸民，不過於常賦之外，變爲衛規，侵呑乾沒之不已，更百端爲例外之求，輒巧取橫征，數倍於正稅。政府一無所利，而小民實受其害。至同一征稅機關之公務員也，無權司出納者，則相形見拙。於百物昂貴之今日，不得不廉潔者，月俸所入，等於枵腹從公，彼處脂膏以自潤者，飽囊盈槖，一若分所應得。余竊以爲不如清查增稅，明取之之爲愈也。　　試言本市之增稅，在此公務員警務員等，不得溫飽待遇之際，九十兩朋如市庫不與區庫賦稅相均衡，則兩月所虧約六千餘萬，此增稅之不能再緩者也。保甲捐因發起於本年度歲入預算已定之後，故另爲籌辦，所定之數，如附戶每月十元，正戶三十元等，由甲長按戶征收，數額旣適當，輕而易舉，人民負担，亦復平均，明歲可賡續辦理者也。房捐則已增百分之六十，其估價以定捐額也，視其房屋之建築設備，地址之交通狀況而定其多寡。地捐則尚未增加，如亦增百分之六十，其估價也，則亦可視其環境之良否，交通之情狀而定其等差焉。此急宜增辦者也。其所增之數，貧富負担，適得其平，且本市繁盛之區占多數，則增稅數額，比較鄉區相差不可以道里計，其所增之總數，當至巨也。　　試言征稅方法之亟宜清查者，如攤販小商店之消費稅也，無帳籍可稽，即有草賬，豕亥魯魚，眞僞莫辨，不侵於吏，即侵於商，或互相分潤之，商七而吏三，不如參用包稅之法，如貿易古玩玉器商，無帳籍可稽，而用口頭定約者，用包稅之例案。由各該業同業公會估定數目，上諸主管局核定之，商人如數納稅焉。此亦清查之方，減少侵蝕之良法也。嘗考財政部稅務署所屬征稅機關，沿用事變以前成例，各設督察督征人員。例如印花稅則有定期檢查，或分季檢查，雖辦法無以前之完備，尚留其具體而微之功用，其檢查也，會同所在區警察，其議罰也，則已失從前會同警務人員合議之良法。但對於外勤職員之抽查，舖保之核對，人民呈訴職員違法事件之澈查，皆爲督察督征之專職。此亦清查積弊，預防違法之良制。近悉本市新改設之特稅處，已於九月十六日成立，設有稽征調查審核管理各科，經此次之整飭，並禁商民取巧隱漏。當不使良法專美於前也。若夫理財之道，不過舉流通之財，行均平之政，無他道也。凡國家之賦稅，明知國用不足，而安於寡取者，開創則民信未孕，承平則國幣未匱，勢不極，法不變故也。以今日值多事之秋，履至艱之會，則不變其何待，如坐視政事之弛廢，政府之貧乏，一般官吏之困窮，而漠然不顧，如秦越人之視肥痏焉。而社會之患，將日久而日深矣。嗟夫！</p>

        <h1>1944.10.10</h1>
<h3>Wishes for National Day</h3>
<p>Time flies, and another year easily passes; it's National Day again. As usual for National Day, we commemorate and celebrate, and as usual, we write articles to mark the occasion. However, observing the current situation and environment, we can hardly celebrate leisurely. Today, we have no special advice, but rather, we revisit old lessons. As the saying goes, "Reviewing the old helps one understand the new," and we should be even more vigilant and practice in the future. We list several wishes to share with fellow countrymen: First, wishes regarding the individual. First of all, understand the times and the environment. Currently, we face the era of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. To strive for final victory, everyone has the responsibility to contribute their strength. How can we contribute our strength? On the one hand, actively work hard in our respective positions. Everyone has their own duties, and duties are positions. Therefore, it is not necessarily only going to the front lines and charging into battle that counts as contributing strength. Modern warfare is total war, which is the sum of the strength of all aspects and departments. Everyone's position, within the scope of total war, has a part of the strength. As long as we work hard in our own positions and increase efficiency, then we have contributed strength and fulfilled our share of responsibility in the decisive battle. On the other hand, it is to practice wartime living. Wartime living at least contains an atmosphere of hardship and seriousness. Therefore, wasteful and undisciplined living is definitely not a phenomenon that wartime living should have. Practicing wartime living aims not only to conserve materials, but also to cultivate habits of hardship and seriousness, and to strengthen one's will. In allied Japan, 100 million people are united and engaged in the war. Some people have not tasted meat for several months. Their habits of hardship and frugality are truly worthy of our emulation. Second, wishes regarding the local area. People in any area must bear the responsibility of protecting everything in the place where they live. For example, if we live in Shanghai, then we have a responsibility to protect Shanghai. [The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual.] We can even say: [The rise and fall of Shanghai is the responsibility of the people of Shanghai.] If the responsibility of protecting the local area is fulfilled, the rear can be stabilized, and we can contribute even greater strength to the front lines. Therefore, local affairs should be the joint responsibility of local people. They must be enthusiastic about public welfare and must not stand idly by, let alone watch from across the river. We must recognize that [if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?]. If the local security is poor, then local people will never have peace. Third, regarding the nation. We look around at the current national situation, which is fragmented and broken, which is truly heartbreaking. The more difficult the country is, the more we must love our country. Past failures have been due to the general lack of a national concept. People without a national concept will never understand the importance of Greater East Asia, nor will they understand the importance of the liberation war. However, the Greater East Asia War is already a war that determines the fate of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. The rise and fall of Greater East Asia depends on this battle, and the success or failure of China naturally also depends on this battle. Finally, regarding allied Japan, [Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan] has already been recognized by enlightened people in both China and Japan. The new Japanese policy towards China and the meaning of the new order of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be widely understood by the Chinese people. How can the Chinese people widely understand this? We believe that [winning the hearts of the people] is the first priority. We should look at the big picture and start with the immediate. The decision of all policies and measures must first gain the support of the Chinese people, especially to gain the understanding of community leaders first, so that it can be conveyed to the general public. We also believe that military, political, and economic aspects should be equally emphasized, all with [winning the hearts of the people] as the first priority. China itself should also adopt an extremely sincere attitude to jointly cope with the decisive battle situation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Completes Horizontal and Vertical Operations on the Mainland</h3>
<p>Crushing the Chongqing-US Counter-Offensive Attempt Japanese Army Base, Central News Agency, 9th - According to Navy reporter Mitani, a telegram from a certain Japanese warship stated: Since the enemy United States began its counter-offensive on Guadalcanal Island, it has successfully seized some islands in the Pacific at the cost of heavy sacrifices. The enemy US, relying on its large amount of iron, adopted a mainland landing offensive operation plan on paper, and began a comprehensive counter-offensive in the Pacific, while also planning to strengthen the US Air Force in Chongqing, which served as a base on the mainland. On the other hand, the enemy fears that Japan will use Southern resources to increase its combat power, so in order to prevent this, in addition to dispatching the Air Force, it also densely deployed submarines in the waters near Japan and the East China Sea to attempt to cut off the Japanese army's supply lines and weaken the Japanese combat power. Especially Wenzhou and Fuzhou were highly valued by the enemy US, and they were actively defended. Because these two places are the best supply bases for enemy submarines, and they can also be reused as footholds when the US military launches a landing offensive on the mainland. In addition, the enemy also strengthened its air force in flight bases near the East China Sea, such as Lishui, Ganzhou, Yushan, Jian'ou, and Longyan, in order to defeat Japanese fleets. They also infiltrated the blockade line of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, and set up surveillance posts and observation platforms on uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, attempting to establish contact with the US Air Force base in Chongqing and enemy submarines. The XX unit of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, in order to crush the enemy's ambitions, continued to land in many places such as XXXXXXXXXX after capturing Wenzhou, tightened the coastal blockade, and secured footholds, leaving enemy submarines and aircraft with no room for activity. On September 27, when the army landed northeast of Fuzhou, the navy was responsible for escorting, and the landing operation was completed without bloodshed. The significance of capturing Wenzhou and Fuzhou this time lies in obtaining strategically important results. Since the success of the horizontal and vertical operations on the mainland, the supply lines of the US Air Force base in Chongqing, which is adjacent to the southeastern coast of China, have been cut off and they are in an isolated state. There is no way out other than self-destruction. At this point, Nimitz and MacArthur also realized the difficulty of landing operations on the mainland. Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Fuzhou, the largest key point on the coast of Fujian Province, has fallen, and the defense of the Japanese army's operations on the coast of China has been further consolidated. The Japanese army recently occupied Wenzhou, and now it has also occupied Fuzhou. The coastal area of ​​China, from Hainan Island, Guangzhou Bay, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other mobile bases in the south, to the Yellow Sea coast north of Shanghai, is occupied by the Japanese army. Now, Wenzhou and Fuzhou, the two major strongholds within 500 kilometers of the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, have also been occupied by the Japanese army, which is very beneficial to the Japanese army's operations. It has dealt a major blow to the counter-offensive of the Chongqing army and the US Air Force in Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities are reorganizing the defeated army, waiting for the Japanese army's front line to be extended, and are ready to attack at any time. However, the Japanese army has now advanced from the military stage to the political stage, which should not be ignored.</p>
<h3>Surprise Attack on Airfield Near Chengdu</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 9th: ○ The Japanese air force in China, braving bad weather on the night of the 7th, launched a preemptive surprise attack on airfields near Chengdu, where the US Air Force was gathering, inflicting heavy damage on them. ○ As for the battle results, at the Pengshan airfield, 23 B-29s, 19 small aircraft, and 2 aircraft of unknown type, totaling 44 aircraft, were destroyed and set on fire. In addition, one ground facility was set on fire after being hit. The results at other airfields could not be confirmed in detail due to bad weather, except that several places were seen to be on fire. ○ The Japanese side lost one aircraft by self-destruction. A certain Japanese base on the Chinese front, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force bombed Chengdu in the rain on the night of the 7th. The Chongqing aircraft were about to take off, but were delayed due to the weather. The Japanese aircraft took the opportunity to launch a preemptive strong attack, and it was confirmed that 23 aircraft were destroyed and 4 were burned. The Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, the Japanese aircraft detachment also raided the Xinjin Daping Temple and Baoza airfields, destroying ground and aviation facilities.</p>
<h3>Preemptive Strike Yields Great Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Chengdu airfield on the 7th in order to suppress the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, destroying a total of 44 Chongqing and US aircraft. The significance of this operation is very important and different from past operations to destroy B-29 aircraft, because this time the Japanese aircraft went to bomb just as the enemy aircraft were taking off, so under the Japanese army's preemptive strike strategy, they suffered heavy losses. Looking back, the enemy aircraft bombed South Manchuria twice on September 8 and 26, but suffered losses of 40 aircraft on the 8th and 35 aircraft on the 26th due to the Japanese air force's interception. However, although they suffered heavy blows, they still attempted to bomb the Japanese mainland, so this time the Japanese army aircraft took preemptive action, causing the Chengdu airfield to suffer heavy damage. According to reports, the Japanese Air Force braved bad weather and set off in heavy rain that day. After searching for a long time, they finally discovered the Chongqing and US aircraft groups concentrated at the Pengshan airfield south of Xinjin, and launched a fierce attack, causing them to lose 44 aircraft. It is estimated that 23 of the destroyed and burning B-29 aircraft were B-29 type aircraft, and the remaining 19 were small aircraft. In addition, another team also bombed Xinjin Wanxian and the Pacific airfields on the same day, and achieved great results. In just one month, they caused them to lose 119 aircraft, while the Japanese side only lost one aircraft.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the First Line of Guangxi</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the Chongqing correspondent of the American Times newspaper on the 8th, the Japanese and Chongqing armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the first line of Guangxi, and the rear of the two armies is very active in fighting. In addition to repairing the Pinghan Railway, the Japanese army is also repairing the Yuehan Railway, directly to the south of Hengyang, to transport weapons and military supplies for the large-scale offensive against Guilin. The Chongqing army is trying to block the Japanese offensive. Bai Chongxi visited Chiang Kai-shek three weeks ago, and flew to Guilin the next day to personally command the operation. Currently, the Chongqing army is continuously dispatching reinforcements to the Guilin area, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is also doing its best to supply the Chongqing defenders. In addition, five divisions of student soldiers have also begun to be recruited.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Guangxi and Hunan Takes Encirclement Position</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Guangxi and Hunan is as follows: The war situation in southeastern China has reached its climax, and the Battle of Guilin is imminent. At this moment, the Japanese army has gradually adopted an encircling offensive in the central region, using two huge currents of encirclement to advance towards Guilin, which is located in 300 highlands. Others are heading south along the Xiang-Gui Railway from the northeast, breaking through the Chongqing army's security line in Xing'an and advancing 20 kilometers west, reaching the second ferry port in Lishui (40 kilometers from Guilin). In front of this place, there is a narrow gap in the Lishui River valley, which is the entrance to the Guilin Plain. One of them advances from Pingle (the transportation hub that controls the southeast) and adopts a wide-ranging encirclement. According to reports, the Japanese army advanced 56 kilometers last week and then suspended its advance to reorganize its troops. ○ In the southern region, the Japanese army is advancing rapidly along the West River from Guangdong. Last week, it arrived in Pingnan and headed north to Pingle. From this, the Japanese army has established contact with the troops attacking Guilin from the south. However, from the point of view of the Japanese army advancing west to Jiangkou, it can be seen that the Japanese army will further advance to Liuzhou to block Guilin from the south, forcing the Chongqing army in the city to retreat westward over the mountains, or even sail directly to Nanning, thereby establishing a transportation line from Korea to Zhao Nan. At the same time, they will crush the last resistance of the Baoqing Chongqing army in Hunan and the northwestern region. At present, the Japanese army in this area is advancing towards Guiyang step by step, but the highway leading to Guiyang is extremely unfavorable for vehicles to travel on, and there are continuous mountains that are easy to defend. Because the occupation of Guiyang is only the first step in blocking Kunming, from the above points, the strong attack of the Baoqing Japanese army is expected to be just a cover for the flank attack on Guilin.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army on Biak Island Completes Mission to Defend the Territory</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Ministry Praises the Spirit of Colonel Katsume Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - On May 27, enemy troops landed on Biak Island in northwestern New Guinea. The Japanese army's Colonel Katsume's troops stationed there bravely engaged the enemy, which consisted of one division, under heavy bombing, launching day and night attacks, engaging in bloody battles. The enemy troops were exhausted and anxious. Meanwhile, the air force team also echoed the operations of this Katsume team, repeatedly attacking the enemy's ocean warships, destroyers, landing boats, etc., inflicting heavy damage on them. Up to June 11, the battle results were: more than 1,500 enemy corpses were abandoned and eight artillery pieces were destroyed. However, the enemy gradually strengthened its forces, and by the end of June, it had strengthened to one and a half divisions, so the airfield on the island gradually fell into the hands of the enemy. Colonel Katsume, the commander of the Japanese army, also died heroically on July 2. The soldiers under his command inherited the commander's will, either sneaking into the enemy's camp at night, or breaking into the enemy's camp with bayonets. Later, they dug cave positions in trenches hundreds of feet underground, communicating with each other. For about five months, the Japanese army on the island, in an isolated and resupply island, completed the important task of defending the territory. Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy US landed on Biak Island in May of this year, the Japanese defenders on the island have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with a small number of troops, while also ensuring the key areas of the island. General Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Army, gave a commendation to the Japanese defenders on the island and the commander of the unit, Colonel Katsume Naoyuki, for their great achievements. The Japanese Ministry of the Army also issued the following commendation on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Commendation</h3>
<p>The defenders of Biak Island, since the enemy troops landed on May 27, Showa 19 (33rd year of the Republic of China), have repeatedly launched large-scale counterattacks against the superior enemy with a small number of troops, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and ensuring the key areas of the island. The contribution to the operation is truly great. The unit, under the command of Colonel Katsume, was able to unite as one, and insisted on fighting with an indomitable spirit, demonstrating the spirit of the Japanese army. Its achievements are truly a model for the entire army. This commendation is hereby awarded on August 1, Showa 19, Terauchi Hisaichi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Army.</p>
<h3>Letter of Appreciation</h3>
<p>Army Colonel Katsume Naoyuki, since December Showa 18, has led the defenders of Biak Island to assist the navy in defending Biak Island. On May 8, Showa 19, enemy troops attempted to land on Biak Island, braving shelling and bombing, and then defeated the enemy at the beach. However, the enemy relied on its superior strength, naval gun fire, repeated bombing, and forced a landing. Although the defenders were few in number, they were good at fighting. Even after the enemy troops landed, they were still able to use night raids to inflict great damage on the enemy. Colonel Katsume fought bravely at the front and died in battle on July 2 after being hit by a bullet. This was beneficial to the overall situation. This letter of appreciation is hereby awarded and announced to the entire army on August 16, Showa 19, Terauchi Hisaichi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Army in the Southern Area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Thailand and Burma, Three Shot Down</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) - On the 6th of this month, the enemy air force used B-24 and B-25 bombers and fighter planes, either alone or in formation, to attack the rear air bases of the Japanese army in Thailand and Burma. The Japanese air defense team immediately intercepted them, shooting down one B-24 and two B-25s. The Japanese army also lost two aircraft.</p>
<h3>President of South Manchuria Railway Flew to Japan Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - President of South Manchuria Railway, Mr. Konichi, flew east on the morning of the 9th to discuss important matters with the Japanese government authorities. He is scheduled to stay in Japan for one month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army on Peleliu Island Launches Night Attack on Enemy Airfield</h3>
<p>Inflicting Significant Damage on the Enemy for Three Weeks Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - After fighting fiercely for three weeks, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island has inflicted more than 18,000 casualties on the enemy. On the night of the 5th, the Japanese army generals and soldiers, together with a unit of suicide squads, broke through the enemy's strict security and infiltrated the airfield, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and its defenses. From 12:30 a.m. to 2:10 a.m. that night, the great fire at the enemy airfield could be seen for more than two hours. On the 6th, the enemy attacked the south end of the Japanese defense line on the east coast and Mount Suifu in the north. The Japanese army inflicted heavy damage on them and repelled most of them. However, a part of the enemy on Dongshan invaded the Japanese army's position and began to build positions. The Japanese defenders are currently preparing to destroy the enemy. The actions of enemy warships on the sea surface of Peleliu Island and Palau's Kosol, etc., are still very frequent. On the evening of the 7th, an enemy hospital ship went to Peleliu Island again to recover the dead and wounded. The enemy aircraft attacks on Palau Island and Koror Island are becoming more and more intense. There were a total of 370 on the 6th and 470 on the 7th. A considerable number of enemy aircraft attacked the Peleliu airfield. The enemy aircraft avoid the Japanese army and the anti-aircraft positions during bombing and shelling, which is different from the past. They strive to conserve resources and are afraid of damage, etc.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Significance of the Fall of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Crushing Future British and American Invasion Attempts Rear Admiral Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Navy's China Fleet, gave a talk on the 7th about the significance of the fall of Fuzhou, the gist of which was: The significance of the fall of Fuzhou is that it thoroughly crushes future British and American invasion operations on the South China coast. The enemy's attempts to establish intelligence, submarine, and air bases in these areas have been repeatedly seen in enemy propaganda. In particular, the enemy military attempted to cooperate with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to set up a bridgehead in the coastal area of ​​China as soon as possible. Therefore, Fuzhou has obviously become one of its important candidate locations. Therefore, this key location is of great importance to the progress of future operations. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is that the Japanese army and navy dispatched naval operations, and the Japanese Navy's China Fleet has a sea-air integrated formation, leaving the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing helpless. This further demonstrates the extent of the Japanese Navy's strength. At the same time, the enemy has repeatedly claimed that the US military has set up a submarine base in Sandu Ao near Fuzhou, which can also prove that all the counter-propaganda is false. No matter how Chongqing and the US military plan and attempt to turn China into a battlefield, the Japanese army will spare no sacrifice to stop it. In fact, this Japanese military operation is the beginning of the Greater East Asia War turning to the offensive. I believe that the local Chinese people will welcome the Japanese army and gladly cooperate in destroying the British and American operations.</p>

<h3>Friction Between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing; Inner Story of the Xinjiang Dispute Can Only Be Solved with Guns and Cannons</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - Regarding the Xinjiang dispute, the Soviet Union will send aircraft to bomb Dihua, and the friction between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing is becoming increasingly acute. To ease the tension, Chongqing has transferred Sheng Shicai, the Governor of Xinjiang Province. According to reliable sources here, the details of the Xinjiang dispute and the friction between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are as follows: Xinjiang is</p>
<h3>China's Back Door</h3>
<p>After his visit to Chongqing, US Vice President Wallace also stated that he had entered Chongqing from America through China's back door, and that Xinjiang was an important location. He returned to America from Xinjiang, China's back door. Why did Wallace repeatedly mention the Xinjiang issue? There is an important reason for this. The fact is as follows: The Soviet Union has been expanding its influence in Xinjiang for many years. Xinjiang has become almost a part of the Soviet Union in terms of politics, economy, and military affairs. Xinjiang Province Chairman Sheng Shicai has not forgotten his motherland, China. In recent years, he has been dealing with the Soviet Union in a compromising manner while actively expanding the internal strength of Xinjiang Province. However, the Soviet Union could no longer tolerate Chairman Sheng's perfunctory policies. The situation became serious in early winter last year. Sheng Shicai's younger brother, Sheng Guoxiong, was a brave warrior loyal to his motherland. He knew that the Soviet Union's oppression had</p>
<h3>Territorial Ambitions</h3>
<p>At the same time, the Soviet Union's instigation of independence movements was a force that fragmented the motherland's independence. The Soviet Union repeatedly proposed to sign a treaty with the Xinjiang Provincial Government, essentially making Xinjiang an independent province of China. He indignantly reported this conspiracy to the Chongqing government. On the sixth day after he contacted them and returned to Xinjiang Province, he was assassinated by the Soviet Union's Fifth Column. He sacrificed himself for the motherland and for Xinjiang Province. With boiling blood, Sheng Shicai, seeing the Chinese Communists instigated by the Soviet Union disrupt public order, had no choice but to take military action. He mobilized troops to protect the provincial capital of Dihua and urgently reported to the Chongqing government, requesting a large army to come to his aid. This tense situation brewed for several months, and finally, shortly after the Chongqing army (Zhu Shaoliang's troops) arrived in Dihua, the war broke out. The officially established Xinjiang Communist Army attacked Dihua, while the Xinjiang Army and the Chongqing Army resisted with the mission of defending their territory. The untrained Communist Army, of course, could not withstand artillery fire and</p>
<h3>Collapsed</h3>
<p>However, during the Communist Army's defeat (in early July of this year), large bombers were discovered in the high sky above Dihua, strafing downwards and dropping countless incendiary bombs. This was something that Sheng Shicai and the Chongqing Army generals had never expected. The Soviet Union was openly providing military support. Therefore, after receiving the urgent information, Yu Jiang immediately ordered a ceasefire. At the same time, a serious protest was filed with the Soviet Union, which was an unavoidable procedure. On the other hand, news control was tightened. All news about the war in Xinjiang was strictly prohibited from being published to avoid stimulating people's emotions. At the same time, when it was unavoidable, an appeal was made to the White House owner in Washington for mediation. After such back-and-forth negotiations involving the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, the Soviet Union finally expressed its willingness to compromise, but demanded that Chairman Sheng Shicai, who caused the incident, be transferred out of Xinjiang. All issues would be resolved through diplomatic channels. The Communist Army and the Chongqing Army would each return to their defense areas. Sheng Shicai then returned to Chongqing. The Chongqing-controlled Political Participation Council made an exception to hold a grand welcoming ceremony for this purpose, praising Sheng Shicai as a model soldier. Furthermore, Chiang himself accompanied him to every meeting, which was considered one of the most glorious pages by the Chongqing military and political circles. How the Xinjiang issue will end, American guns, Soviet guns, and Chongqing guns, most people believe that it can only be resolved with guns.</p>
<h3>The Xinjiang Issue</h3>
<p>However, the Chongqing government continues to adopt appeasement diplomacy towards the Soviet Union on the surface, which is why they emphasize the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. On the 5th of this month, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao also advocated strengthening friendly Sino-Soviet relations, especially advocating the selection of outstanding talents to form a national goodwill delegation and send them to Moscow as soon as possible to strengthen Sino-Soviet relations. On the other hand, the new Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Wu Zhongxin, when convening provincial government and department officials on the 5th of this month for a pro-government speech, also mentioned the issue of Sino-Soviet relations. He said, "Xinjiang is located at a crucial point in Sino-Soviet transportation and bears an unavoidable mission under the principle of being friendly and good neighbors. I will act in accordance with the wishes of the Chongqing government to actively strengthen the spirit of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union." From this, it can be seen that Chongqing is actively expressing friendliness to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union still despises Chongqing. Therefore, how Chongqing and third countries will deal with the Soviet Union's ambitions in Xinjiang will inevitably leave a major problem on Chongqing's borders, and will also create British and American power. Therefore, the relationship between them is increasingly complex. In East Asia, the relationship between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, their friction, there is a high probability of an outbreak.</p>

<h3>New German Army Fights Bravely on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Aachen Area Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency dispatch: Although the German Grenadier Division was established not long ago, it has made decisive contributions in the war on the Western Front to contain the anti-Axis forces. A reporter recently visited the operational line of the new division in the Moselle area and saw that the division possessed the latest weapons. Within ten days, it repelled six unsuccessful American offensives. The soldiers of the new army are mostly young people aged eighteen to twenty, fully trained, and with high morale, so they always win. Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency dispatch: The American army's fierce attack in the Aachen area has failed to break through the defense line. The focus of the war on the Western Front has shifted back to the northern wing, and fierce fighting is also taking place in the area between Ambervillers and Ruhr south of Geilenkirchen, and in the Metz area. The German bridgehead on the Scheldt River east of Antwerp is preventing the anti-Axis forces from using the port of Antwerp. The enemy has repeatedly attacked the bridgehead, but has met with strong resistance and made little progress to the northeast and north. The situation in Nijmegen is also becoming more intense. British reinforcements have not yet been able to withstand the German pressure. The German army has made considerable progress between the Waal and Lek rivers. General Hodges, south of Geilenkirchen, with the help of artillery and aircraft, is assisting tank forces in attacking the German positions east of Ubach-Palenberg. The US First Army has broken into the German defense line, and the German counterattack is now in fierce combat. The fighting on the Metz line has become more intense over the weekend. The American army has created a gap in the German front line near Maacheren, but the German army's counterattacks near Dram and Parroy Forest have been quite successful. The US Seventh Army continues to operate between Ambervillers and Ruhr on the southern wing of the Western Front, but the German army has filled the gaps near Grandtville. The American army south of Remianmont has also been stopped by the German army.</p>
<h3>Port of Dunkirk Reduced to Ruins</h3>

<h3>Chinese Communists Are Making Every Effort to Launch a Pincer Attack on the Chongqing Military and Government</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - The relationship between the Yan'an regime and the Soviet Union has always been quite close. Recently, it sent representatives Qin Bangxian and Wang Ming to Moscow to visit and directly negotiate with the Soviet government to ensure Soviet assistance. Therefore, the Chinese Communists have expressed [the future of China is in our hands]. As a result, Yan'an's attitude towards Chongqing has become increasingly tough, and it frequently launches a pincer attack on the Chongqing government. According to reliable sources, on the 4th of this month, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government organized a Preparatory Committee to celebrate the Double Ten National Day and used the name of the committee to make a statement, not hesitating to criticize Chongqing. The content stated that we deeply understand that before victory is achieved, there are considerable obstacles in the future that will have a significant impact. This is the consistent dictatorial policy of the Chongqing Kuomintang, that is, the military and political institutions without any vitality. How does the work of this minority of dictatorial power look like? Based on the following points, the general public can know: 1. After repeated defeats, they do not allow others to fight, but rather make a planned dissolution of the Communist Party, eliminating four-fifths of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and plan to advocate the incorporation of the remaining one-fifth of the forces under the unified military power of defeatism. 2. Their attempts have implemented fascism, abandoned the Three Principles of the People, and opposed the Three Principles of the People. This can be seen in the fact that democratic politics is not allowed to be implemented. However, on the surface, they allow local autonomy and the people to participate in politics, but this is completely contrary to the facts. 3. The results of Chongqing's repeated defeats have completely failed the anti-Axis countries' attempts to counterattack within Chinese territory. Therefore, in order to oppose the Chongqing Kuomintang's autocracy, immediately convene a temporary National Assembly, convene all parties and factions, as well as local troops, governments, and talents from various public organizations, and further demand the implementation of the reorganization of the Chongqing government and the Military Affairs Commission to organize a joint government and a joint military commission to implement the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Now that the Communist Party's criticism is quite strong, the process of the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party has shifted to negotiations between the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. However, after the Chongqing army's military defeats in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, its response to the Communist Party is passive, and the reason is actually the result of pressure from Washington. However, the decline in the Chongqing army's combat strength will give the Communist Party a good opportunity in international activities. Knowledgeable people in Chongqing are deeply concerned about the discussion of the Chongqing-Communist Party issue.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Air Raid Drill Showed More Progress Than Before, According to Comments Released by Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Citizens Air Defense Headquarters issued the following comments on yesterday's air defense drill: Based on the results of various air defense drills held on the tenth air defense day, it is believed that the general awareness of air defense among the citizens of this country is progressing greatly. In particular, the cooperation given by citizens and the waiting training in the Nanjing Road area, although carried out by districts, is considered to have made unusual progress compared to before. However, we must not be complacent because of this. In the event of an actual air raid, current air defense technology may not be able to protect the safety of each person's life. The enemy's air raids are not only strategic, but also seem to have intentions towards the compatriots of this city, as can be seen from the bombing situation in China, South China, and the example of the air raid on Manila. The Air Defense Headquarters believes that even one person's injury must be avoided as much as possible. It is regrettable that some citizens have an indifferent attitude towards the Headquarters' measures in this regard. This training will make use of the monitoring posts recently established throughout the city and use waiting as the main items. It is different from the past, which was limited to a very small area and attempted high-level training. All residents were mobilized in each district to conduct exercises in their respective districts. There are as many as seventeen designated exercise areas in the city. As a result of the exercise, several points that still need to be studied are noted below for the reference of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps and the Air Defense Class in the future.</p>
<h3>Points to Be Improved Yesterday</h3>
<p>This training has not yet broken away from past habits and is still far from achieving the ideal of total citizen mobilization, and general basic training has not been sufficient. Therefore, we hope that instructors will recognize the importance of strengthening air defense awareness so that subordinates can unite and work together to enlighten the general public's air defense awareness. The points that need to be improved are recorded below: 1. When designating buildings as public shelters, more consideration must be given, because if the buildings are used for business purposes and already need to accommodate a large number of people on weekdays, it seems difficult to accommodate external refugees. In addition, small buildings that can only accommodate a few or dozens of people do not seem suitable as public shelters. 2. After the air raid alarm is issued, it is inappropriate for police officers, Baojia personnel, and members of the Self-Defense Corps to allow cars, tricycles, and bicycles to continue driving. They should be quickly ordered to stop on the side of the road, disperse to wait, and pay attention to maintaining an appropriate distance from road corners, bridgeheads, etc. 3. Although the clothing of those directly involved in air defense has gradually been improved to facilitate activities, it is regrettable that instructors are still wearing long gowns or clothing that is not conducive to air defense activities on patrols. Therefore, instructors should first be concerned about their own clothing and quickly prepare headscarves and gloves. 4. Waiting is the main item of this training. Although the issuance of the guiding outline and the training period were very short, some areas were still satisfactory. This should be attributed to the hard work of the instructors in the area. Areas that have not been able to be comprehensive should pay attention to the following points. Waiting means that when enemy aircraft are discovered or machine sounds are heard, or when the air defense agency instructs to wait, you must avoid danger on your own and temporarily wait in a safe place. After the danger has passed, you can engage in air defense activities. This point does not seem to be completely thorough, especially the transmission method should be improved again, that is, the situation prompted by the monitoring post should first be reported to the commander, and then the commander should be assigned to important places. Configure transmission posts to take on transmission work and be responsible for guiding the waiting of nearby residents. Air defense personnel must not lie in the middle of the road to avoid danger. Although the lighting control is usually very good, it was not considered good at night. In particular, the lighting control of rickshaws and tricycles is still lacking. In short, although the appearance of each training session has improved, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. All of us citizens should realize that the current exercises are equivalent to actual combat, so as to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>Fire-Fighting Exercise Results in Various Districts</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the tenth Air Defense Day. The Citizens Air Defense Headquarters summarized the results of the fire-fighting exercise in various districts of the city and made the following comments: ○Regarding the fire-fighting exercise 1. The replenishment of fire-fighting water has improved significantly, but should be prepared in advance. In particular, in the non-exercise areas south of the Suzhou River, some water tanks have not been filled with water, and only a small amount of water remains at the bottom of the tank. 2. There seem to be too many people carrying fire-fighting water in lead buckets, which is the opposite of being quick. The method of adding water should be designed according to the situation and timing, so that fire-fighting battles can have good results. 3. Observation of wind direction should be stepped up, emphasizing the direction of the wind to prevent the fire from spreading. 4. It is still considered lacking to use moistened grass mats to extinguish the fire caused by incendiary bombs. This seems to be of no benefit in peacetime, but after several actual tests, it is recognized that it is absolutely necessary to use it. 5. There are many high buildings in this city, so the methods of extinguishing fires at high altitudes should be studied. 6. There are still the majority of Chinese-style houses in this city, so in addition to pouring water with lead buckets, hand-operated pumps should also be used. 7. In addition to the exercise personnel, there are still citizens who take a bystander attitude, which should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Household Flour on Sale Today</h3>
<p>Additional Allotment of Two Catties of Soybeans The city's Goods Allocation Office has decided to start allocating soybeans in the old District 1 today, with two catties per person, selling at 15 yuan of Central Reserve Certificates per catty, until the 22nd of this month. Citizens in that district can purchase it at the food retail store with the same number listed on the ticket with the 21st comprehensive joint ticket. The allocation of soybeans in other districts will be announced later. At the same time, household flour is also scheduled to go on sale today, ending on the 22nd, with one catty of No. 2 flour per person, selling at 42 yuan of Central Reserve Certificates. Citizens in the old District 1 can purchase it with the 22nd comprehensive joint ticket, and other districts can purchase it with the 45th period flour certificate issued by the former Grain Bureau. The household rice will be generally sold starting on the 15th of this month, still selling for city liters per person.</p>
<h3>The New Association Holds a Movie Speech Tonight to Celebrate National Day; Yesterday, a Peking Opera Benefit Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Association is celebrating the Double Tenth Festival with a grand three-day celebration. Yesterday, the association specially invited famous Shanghai opera performers such as Zhou Xinfang, Chen Hefeng, and Chen Yongling to hold a Peking Opera benefit performance to celebrate National Day in advance. There were a total of 14 performances, including "Three Iron Roosters," "Da Ju Ping Shan," "Shi Qian Stealing Chickens," and "Hongmen Banquet" followed by "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin." The performances were extraordinary and wonderful, and the audience was unprecedentedly large. During the intermission, Jin Xiongbai, a standing director of the Shanghai News Association, delivered a speech, stating roughly: "Today, when the country is facing many difficulties, our association is holding this Peking Opera gathering to celebrate National Day. Due to the upliftment of the national spirit, we can foresee that the suffering will end and sweetness will come next year today, and the country's revival, the completion of the war, and the completion of the liberation of East Asia are all predictable."

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Basketball Game Yesterday: Zhongbei Defeats Huaying; Shantou Team Defeats Tongren</h3>
<p>In the second act of the Shen Bao Cup Basketball Game, the first match last night was between the Class B Fat Team and the Sanlian Team. Although the former was obese, their skills were excellent and their experience surpassed others. Song Qihou was also a leader among them, so they won 31 to 23. The Fat Team got off to a good start. Then the Class A game took to the stage, and the atmosphere was even more tense. Zhongbei and Huaying faced off. The former had Yin Huanwen, who had just come from the north, to help them, and their momentum was strong. After the start of the battle, Huaying tried their best to defend and were quite able to cope. The situation was very balanced. Unfortunately, Huaying's ball handling was poor, and they always lagged behind. However, Che Yaoan's efforts won a lot of applause. Yin Huanwen of Zhongbei seemed to be still unfamiliar. The result of the first half was that Zhongbei led 15 to 8. The situation remained the same in the second half. Although Huaying tried hard to struggle, they were ultimately inferior in strength. In the end, the result was 35 to 26, Zhongbei defeated Huaying. In the last game, Shantou team played against Tongren. Although Tongren lost, their spirit was good. The result was 62 to 33.</p>

<h3>Increase in Radio Listening Fees Adds to the Burden of Ordinary People</h3>
<p>— Jin Hu</p>
<p>Since October, the China Broadcasting Association has increased the monthly radio listening fee to 100 yuan, more than three times the original 30 yuan per month half a year ago. This listening fee was originally one of the state's wartime taxes, and those who own radios should pay taxes without a doubt. However, this sudden sharp increase, compared with the first collection of radio listening fees last October, which was 10 yuan per month, is a ratio of ten to one. Originally, radio in Shanghai was a very common and inexpensive entertainment tool. In fact, culturally advanced countries have regarded it as a necessity for every household, like beds, tables, and chairs. It also has the functions of reporting news, education, and entertainment, which are encouraged and promoted by the government. Now that the Broadcasting Association has greatly increased the listening fee, we ordinary people will no longer be able to listen to or have this cheapest entertainment and education tool. Last year, 10 yuan per month was a small amount. Even though my five-tube radio only listened for an average of three hours a day, the electricity bill was 6 or 7 yuan per month, and the listening fee was already 10 yuan. However, after a year, under the effort to reduce electricity consumption, the listening time of the radio has decreased. This is inevitable for every family with a radio. Even if it is set to listen for three hours a day, the electricity bill is 31.5 yuan per month (calculated based on the September electricity bill), and the listening fee is 100 yuan. Moreover, how can we listen freely every day at this time and place without worrying about the possibility of a power outage? Once the listening fee rises sharply, if we stop listening, we must dismantle the machine and submit it to the Broadcasting Association for verification and permission, which will turn it into waste. Moreover, it will not be desired by others for transfer in the future. If we put it aside and do not listen, it is impossible, and it is easy to break. If we sell it immediately, how many people want to buy it at this time of electricity saving? Moreover, my machine is old and has poor reception. Selling it is not worth much, and it is a pity to discard it. For the above reasons, I dare to boldly ask the Broadcasting Association to consider the limited entertainment and education of ordinary people and the original intention of the state to set up radio stations, and maintain the original listening fee as much as possible, then the ordinary people will be fortunate, and the national broadcasting industry will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Recent Youth (2)</h3>
<p>At this critical moment for the Empire, I am extremely honored to have a place to die. I respectfully shout "Banzai" to His Majesty the Emperor. For the past twenty-three years, I have been blessed by the kindness of my parents and family, and I have also received guidance and teachings from the teachers of primary and secondary schools, as well as the naval instructors and superiors. I am extremely grateful. I can only express my condolences to the bereaved family of Petty Officer Hatahata, who was on the same ship. Finally, I must declare that I am deeply regrettable to die before repaying even one ten-thousandth of the Emperor's kindness— (This is truly like the state of mind of a real person, truly like a real person's will.) Longfu read the abbreviated handwriting scraped on the newspaper, once from the left and once from the right. The sacred kindness, parental kindness, and teacher kindness, which are unforgettable in the heart, are indeed good customs in the hometown, but flowing out from the tip of the real person's pen, each word seems to turn into a gentle and elegant voice, spreading to Longfu's ears. Even with the care for his subordinate, Petty Officer Hatahata, Longfu indeed felt that this was the real person's aura. In the Hachiman School and the Second Middle School era, the real person was always like an older brother to me. Although Longfu himself was in the same class, he always felt like a younger brother. The love for his younger brother was not exactly the same. Ah, yes, when eating at the Wu Zhen Water Exchange, the real person narrowed his eyes and talked about the subordinate he met in Sakashita. (Then, isn't that non-commissioned officer Petty Officer Hatahata?) Although Longfu thought of this, there was no evidence to prove it. Longfu immediately thought of a part of the public will of Commander Sakuma. Do not let the bereaved family of my subordinates suffer from hunger and starvation—isn't the commander's intention completely manifested in the real person's will? Perhaps the real person was aware of Commander Sakuma when writing his will. But after thirty-two years, they are connected due to the same state of mind and the same underwater soldiers. (This must be a legend!) Longfu was in awe. Naval soldiers pass on to each other and inherit this invisible, unseen legend. (149)</p>
<h3>Old People's Home Calls for Donations</h3>
<p>Goal: 5 million yuan Period: From October 10 to November 10 Collection Location: Social Service Department of This Newspaper Date of Publication: Founded for nearly 40 years, it houses 350 orphaned elderly men and women over the age of 60. The nuns personally care for them until the end of their lives. The expenses of the hospital were formerly subsidized by European and American foreign firms to the greatest extent. Since the environment has changed, this source of funds has been suspended abruptly. At this time, when everything is expensive, it is difficult to maintain. The accumulated debts have reached 600,000 to 700,000. If there is no way to help, it will inevitably be tied up and waiting for death. Therefore, we have to make a call for help. Yesterday, those who responded to the news were extremely enthusiastic. In one day, 340,000 yuan has been donated, which shows that the society is enthusiastic and cares deeply about the elderly relief movement, which is admirable. We still hope that all sectors of society will generously contribute with a heart of kindness. We respectfully ask for the sake of the lonely and helpless elderly.</p>

<h3>The Current Problem of Educational Reform</h3>
<p>— Xie Yaoshou</p>
<p>Recently, donations to various scholarship funds have been very enthusiastic, demonstrating that the general public has a clear understanding of the importance of education. However, on the other hand, many insightful people are deeply dissatisfied with the current education system, believing that such education is enough to ruin the country. This statement is perhaps a bit too激烈的， but it is not to say that education is bad. It is only to say that the current school education is far from the original purpose of education! The general public often attributes the shortcomings of schools to the narrowness of school buildings, the lack of funding, and the incompleteness of equipment. These are all due to environmental limitations and are not the fundamental problem of current education. As for abolishing arts and commerce subjects and shortening the length of schooling, these are only temporary measures for extraordinary times and not a long-term plan for nurturing people. Therefore, to speak from the branches and leaves is too trivial! Let us leave aside the branches and leaves and discover the root cause! The basic shortcoming of general schools today can be summed up in one sentence: [neglect of moral education]. In the school's view, it seems that as long as knowledge is instilled in students, that is enough. As for the students' character and thoughts, it is not their business. In the students' view, the only purpose of coming to school is to seek knowledge, and being able to receive all kinds of knowledge without missing anything is considered a good student! As for how one should live one's life, they not only think it is unimportant but have never even considered the question at all. This is like a rudderless boat sailing in the turbulent sea, not knowing where to go. How dangerous is that! Moreover, schools are places for training citizens. If one is muddleheaded in school, how can society have excellent citizens? If the school does not take this responsibility, who should take it? In fact, treating moral, intellectual, physical, and social education as equally important is already inappropriate: moral education is the foundation of everything. Moral education is the proper development of intellectual, physical, and social education. It is not that there is moral education apart from intellectual education, etc., nor is it that there can be intellectual education, physical education, social education, etc., without moral education. Xunzi said: [Only after the bow is adjusted can one seek its strength; only after the horse is tamed can one seek its quality; a scholar must be sincere before he can be intelligent. If he is not sincere but capable, he is like a jackal and cannot be approached.] Those who are good at all kinds of tricks to deceive and exploit, have they not received intellectual education? Those who rob along the road and do business without capital, have they not received physical education? Those who form cliques for private gain and collude to commit fraud, have they not received social education? Without moral education, the greater one's ability, the greater one's ability to do evil. It is like adding wings to a tiger. When people hear the word moral education, they laugh at it as being pedantic. But have they really known the importance of moral education? The most harmful consequences of the general school's neglect of moral education are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Let us examine the purpose of general students seeking education. Those who only want to get a diploma are not worth mentioning. Even the more outstanding ones only say that they are learning a skill for future use in society. But this is also selfish. They do not know the purpose of life at all and only want to seek benefits for themselves. Why study science and engineering? Because there is a lack of talent in science and engineering, which will make it easier to make a living in the future. Why study arts and commerce? Because the courses in arts and commerce are easy, and it is easy to get a title. Utilitarianism has a deep impression in the minds of general students. Even if they make some contributions to society in the future, it will still be based on the motive of seeking benefits. Therefore, they often complain that there is too much theory in the courses and that it is not practical. In their opinion, they think they are not being impractical. But they do not know that practicality is the application of theory to practice. Without theory, how can one be practical? The reason why general students are not practical now is not because they only have theory, but because they cannot thoroughly understand the theory. Cheng Yi said: [Only with true knowledge can one act]. Mr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out the importance of theory in Knowing is Difficult, Acting is Easy. Therefore, practicality comes from theory, and without theory, there is no practicality. Moreover, the world today is multifaceted. One skill alone cannot cope. To think that those who study science and engineering should not know economics, and that those who study politics can ignore history, is completely wrong. What is generally called practicality today is actually just being greedy for small gains and quick results, seeking immediate benefits, and pursuing personal enjoyment. Have they really had the ambition to [open up things and complete tasks] [establish oneself and reach others]? Greed for profit and small gains is a major shortcoming of current education.</p>
<p>Because the motive for seeking education comes from greed for profit, students only seek to get by in their courses, recording notes word for word. As for what is outside the course and not taught by the teacher, they ignore it. When it comes to exams, they are all very nervous, treating it as a big deal, asking the teacher to specify the scope, not to test what was tested last time, burning the midnight oil desperately, memorizing by rote, hoping to get a score of 80 or 90. This is still the so-called hardworking student; those who do not work hard try all kinds of cheating methods, hoping to pass by luck this time. Whether hardworking or not, they all focus on the score and do not consider what relationship the course they are studying has with them. Needless to say, those who cheat, even those who are called hardworking, treat exams and weekdays as two separate things. Are they not also being hypocritical? Therefore, once the exam is over, most of what they have learned has been forgotten! They also feel that the exam is over, the goal has been achieved, and it is time to forget. Teachers who [make it easy for others] specify the so-called [important] points, so students naturally do not review what is outside the specified scope! Teachers who think they are strict deliberately dig out minor and irrelevant questions from the seams of the book to make things difficult for students. Students also try to memorize many dispensable answers to cater to the teacher's intentions. Teachers and students suspect each other and try to guess each other's minds, neglecting the important main points! Confucius said: [Ancient scholars studied for themselves]. I don't know if today's students are studying for themselves! The school should also bear considerable responsibility for this behavior of students. On weekdays, they regard classes as unimportant, but when the semester ends, they make a big fuss, announcing: the big exam will be held on such and such day, students should work harder. This is very ridiculous. Only work hard before the exam, so can you not work hard at other times? If you work hard on weekdays, then when the exam comes, you only need to [bring out what you know], how easy it is! Why work hard! Because the school regards this as a big deal, the students also follow suit. So isn't the student's hypocrisy induced by the school? Moreover, once the exam comes, students desperately compete with each other for better grades. Even good friends are jealous and unwilling to discuss with each other, for fear that their grades will surpass their own. If there are special rewards for those who are at the top, then the competition will be even more intense! Students with similar grades become like enemies. Schools are supposed to teach people courtesy and humility. Doesn't the exam encourage people to compete? Moreover, during the exam, so-called strict schools arrange seats, verify photos, and send people to monitor all four corners, glaring like tigers, as if everyone taking the exam in the room is intent on cheating. How disrespectful is this to others' self-esteem! In fact, if the school discovers someone cheating, it shows that its teaching is ineffective and cannot find a thorough way to eradicate it. How can it boast of strict management by catching cheating! In the past, during the imperial examination era, there should have been restrictions such as guarantors and searches. Aspiring scholars all thought that it was treating scholars like thieves and would rather not take the exam. How can we still retain the bad habit of treating scholars like thieves now? The school may say that cheating and taking exams for others are not allowed, but if it does not pay attention to daily courses and exaggerates the exam excessively, the result cannot be avoided! To be perfunctory and get by on weekdays, and then rush to work hard at the last minute, is this not deceiving oneself? Is this not cheating? Replacing the me who does not work hard on weekdays with the me who hugs Buddha's feet at the last minute, is this not taking the exam for others? Young people are the future masters of the country. They don't know how great a responsibility they will bear. When faced with the small matter of an exam, they are so nervous that they are at a loss. How can they [turn the tide]? When they are young, they don't know how to respect themselves, can't be confident, and endure the contemptuous treatment during exams, only hoping to pass by luck. How can they [be independent and fearless, and not be troubled by being reclusive]? Being perfunctory on weekdays and seeking luck during exams is another major shortcoming of current education.</p>
<p>A person who grows up in the countryside begins to feel the loveliness of the countryside. A person who grows up in the city will not have this feeling. Therefore, those who have deeply studied their own culture will naturally love their own country. Moreover, society is accumulated by countless years of history. Those who do not know the previous culture cannot understand today's society. But current education clearly does not pay attention to this point. It seems that everything in the past is useless and empty. It only pays attention to foreign culture and does not know about its own culture. Isn't this putting the cart before the horse? General students know Shakespeare and Dickens, but when it comes to Tang Xianzu and Cao Xueqin, they don't know! They know Kant and Hegel, but when it comes to Cheng Yi and Lu Xiangshan, they don't know! In their imagination, it seems that China was still in the Stone Age one or two hundred years ago, and everything was uncivilized. There is no culture worth paying attention to. This attitude can be felt everywhere. They know how all the etiquette in society should be in the West, and they imitate it, but they vaguely don't know how it should be according to the opinions of the ancient sages of China. In a conversation, they always want to mix in a few English words intentionally or unintentionally, as if not doing so is not enough to show that they have received higher education. Even if we don't overthink what this will lead to, just the [not paying attention] point is not a good phenomenon! Not knowing one's own culture is another major shortcoming of current education.</p>
<p>Human affairs are interconnected, so all knowledge is closely or distantly interconnected. There are absolutely no two subjects that are unrelated. So-called flexible application is the ability to discover the relationship between subjects and their relationship to life. So-called rote learning is to put all subjects in opposition to each other, not interacting with each other. They don't even know how to connect the subjects, and they are even more isolated from the relationship to life. Therefore, seeking education and life are clearly divided into two things, and seeking education is also clearly divided into several subjects. What is the use of such knowledge? Let's take an example. Plato announced at the gate of his academy: [Those who do not know how to learn Eudoxus' geometry are not allowed to enter.] What is the relationship between mathematics and philosophy, literature, art, etc.? This is because the basic purpose of learning mathematics is not just to be able to calculate. Calculating can be said to be secondary. The most important thing is to train people's ability to analyze and deduce. But now general students only think that being able to solve every problem is a big deal. As for dealing with human affairs, they are at a loss and don't know where to start, where the main point is, where the secondary point is, how to analyze it, and how to deal with it. This situation is the easiest to encounter. They all complain that the school doesn't teach them. In fact, the school can't teach them. Even if it wants to teach them, it is impossible in fact. Human affairs change at any time, and no two things are exactly the same. So how can we predefine fixed methods? But as long as you have the ability to analyze things, aren't you afraid that you can't deal with them? This situation is also the result of greed for profit. They cannot sincerely and earnestly seek self-attainment, only knowing how to seek knowledge but not knowing its relationship to life is another major shortcoming of current education.</p>
<p>In summary, all the shortcomings are only because of the neglect of moral education! People say: [Society is a big dyeing vat, and many pure young people are dyed bad by it!] That's right, but the school itself is a small dyeing vat. Which of the various pains and mistakes is not secretly brewing in the school? On weekdays, they only know how to study for profit, and in the future, they will naturally [beg at the grave] [climb the dragon], [bend the ruler to seek the straight]. How can they [see profit and think of righteousness] [not be careless in the face of wealth]? On weekdays, they only seek to get by, and in the future, they will naturally be perfunctory, procrastinating and lazy in everything. How can they [devote themselves to the task until death]? When faced with the small matter of an exam, they are still panicked and hoping to pass by luck. In the future, they will naturally [worry about gains and losses] [go with the flow]. How can they [be neutral and upright] [bear heavy responsibilities]? Studying hard is one's duty, but they compete with each other for classification and bonuses. In the future, they will naturally be uneasy in their humble circumstances, showing off their power. How can they [be indifferent to fame and fortune, and be quiet to reach far]? On weekdays, they don't know their own culture, and in the future, they will naturally be infatuated with foreign races, [destroying their crowns and tearing their robes]. How can they [restore my country] [share the same hatred with you]? On weekdays, they divide studying and life into two separate things, not really communicating with each other. In the future, they will naturally have no fixed opinions and float with the customs. How can they distinguish between righteousness and profit, and clearly discern right and wrong? Precisely because the education they receive is like this, once they enter society, it will become deeper and deeper, until they lose their original heart completely. Therefore, the result of neglecting moral education is: emphasizing theory creates new-style bookworms; emphasizing practicality creates civilized exploiters; being perfunctory in education creates mediocre fools; being strict in education creates shrewd merchants. Such education is disappointing. Zhu Xi said: [If the court wants to restore the Central Plains, it must abolish the imperial examination for thirty years!] If we want to find a way to clarify the source for the current society, then the education system really needs to be thoroughly reformed!</p>
<p>Speaking of reform methods, they can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>1.  The students' academic performance largely depends on the teacher's teaching. A good teacher, in addition to surpassing knowledge, must also have a voluntary enthusiasm for education. If they have no intention of teaching and only seek to get by, what is the use of even abundant knowledge? Therefore, strict selection of teachers is the first step in reforming education. Once the selection of teachers is determined, their treatment should be improved. This will not only enable them to stay in their positions for a long time, but also show respect for teachers. Then the teachers can [patiently and skillfully guide], and the students can [sincerely and faithfully follow]. Compared with teachers changing all the time, its efficiency will naturally increase a lot. Most of the current job seekers say that they are just trying to make a living, but this can never be the case in the education field. It is excusable in other industries, but if teachers also put making a living first, the result will be perfunctory. They themselves have not deeply studied the courses, but come to teach students, deceiving themselves and others, which is simply unforgivable.</p>
<p>2.  When new students enter school, they should be strictly examined. It is better to have insufficient numbers than to over-enroll excessively and lower the standard of education. This may lead to other problems such as insufficient funding, but these are matters outside of education itself, so I will not discuss them in detail for the time being. The general situation now is that excellent students are often unable to continue their studies because they are poor, and those who are able to continue their studies often give up on themselves and are unwilling to make progress. The establishment of scholarships has more or less solved the former problem, but the latter problem also urgently needs to be solved. The goal of education is not so much to increase the quantity as to improve the quality; it is better to have fewer educated people and enable all educated people to become the pillars of the country in the future. We must never allow spoiled elements and excellent students to receive higher education together, which will lead to a decline in morale.</p>
<p>3.  Once the selection of teachers and students is determined, education begins. The school's responsibility is to train excellent citizens, not just to impart some knowledge, making people like machines or learning how to make a living and becoming merchants. Therefore, cultivating oneself and rectifying one's heart is the essential task of education. General schools all have school mottos and rules grandly displayed, but how many students can abide by them? They are just treated as official articles! Even during class, there are still sounds of ridicule and arrogance. If school rules cannot be followed in school, it is no wonder that behavior is not disciplined in a society without general rules! In recent years, most schools have resumed reading the classics, but this is also largely unnecessary. Reading without acting, in one ear and out the other, is truly what Confucius said, "I can do nothing about it." Zhang Yu, Kong Guang, Liu Xin, and Ma Rong were not all famous Confucian scholars? Therefore, reading the classics may not be necessary, but it is necessary to constantly persuade and prohibit students' daily actions, whether inside or outside the classroom.</p>
<p>4.  Speaking of the reform of the school system, the first thing is that the examination system must be abolished; even if it is difficult to change due to long-standing habits, the examination should be slightly de-emphasized, and more emphasis should be placed on daily performance. In fact, the student's learning can be determined in daily Q&amp;A. Why wait until the exam? If you need to wait until the exam to determine the student's merits, then the teacher is also extremely incompetent! Some people think that exams are the only way for schools to supervise students. Once abolished, they will inevitably be lazy and unwilling to work hard. This statement is specious. All things are only afraid of not having interest, not of not working hard. Knowing it, you will definitely like it, and liking it, you will definitely enjoy it. It's just one thing. Strictly reviewing students' admission, there will naturally be no slackers who cheat for diplomas; with the earnest teachings of excellent teachers, they will naturally have a great interest in the courses. How can they be lazy and not study things they are very interested in? If they have no interest at all, and use exams to force them to work hard, isn't that teaching people to be hypocritical and deceive themselves? Such hard work, I am afraid, will outweigh the benefits!</p>
<p>5.  It is good to have regulations on the length of schooling to avoid the disadvantages of accumulating and waiting, but everyone's talent is different, and applying the same rules to everyone will inevitably prevent those with high talent from fully developing their individuality, and those with low talent will suffer from being too forced. Therefore, the length of schooling should be slightly flexible so that both high and low talents can develop as much as possible without being forced. Moreover, there is another point. The current education system, except for those who are hopelessly foolish, can graduate after reaching a certain age. Does the student really thoroughly understand it? Or are they just getting by? This is a big question. Some people say: Current education is really similar to donating an official position in the past. As long as you pay enough tuition and pass a certain period, you will get a diploma. I don't know what those who aim to get by feel about this.</p>
<p>6.  The teaching methods of general teachers mostly tend to memorization, teaching students to read and recite by rote. These teachers think that as long as they cram enough knowledge like stuffing a duck, they don't care about the advantages and disadvantages. As for the students, they only know how to desperately memorize, but they are ignorant of the main points of the book. Wang Yangming said: [If you only want to remember, you will not understand.] This is true. Moreover, some teachers ask students to directly copy the book word for word during the exam, deducting points for every word missed. This is dictation, not learning, not the person reading the book, but the book using the person! Therefore, in the future, the method of reform should be to make teachers use discussion methods, so that students can understand and gain on their own, forming the ability to analyze things, not focusing on memorizing words and sentences.</p>
<p>The above are all the most important points I have discussed. As for other trivial matters, I do not have time to list them in detail for the time being. As long as the fundamental shortcomings are corrected, everything else can be solved easily and does not need to be discussed in detail. Cheng Yi said: [If we try to rectify it without changing it, then it will be incurable; if we must save it, we must change it. A big change will bring great benefits, and a small change will bring small benefits.] The importance of education is well known to everyone, so there is no need to elaborate. The shortcomings of today's education are so obvious, so how to reform education is what we need to work hard on now. We must not give up because the procedures are troublesome and the accumulation is difficult to reverse, and just let it pass!</p>
<h3>Humble Suggestions for Improving the Pathological State of Education in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Shi Puyu</p>
<p>The reason a nation is strong or weak, the reason a people rise or fall, in examining their causes, there are certainly many, but whether education is managed well, whether schools are established widely, is truly a very good compass and touchstone. Since ancient times, our country has attached great importance to education. For example, Confucius's school divided teaching into six areas: ritual, music, archery, charioteering, mathematics, and writing. Mencius said, "[Carefully attending to the teaching of schools, emphasizing filial piety and brotherly respect]," and thus, in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, talent emerged in great numbers, enjoying a period of great prosperity. Since the Han Dynasty, officials were selected based on their understanding of the Five Classics or their virtuous and upright character. Since the Tang Dynasty, officials were selected through the imperial examination system. Although the methods have changed slightly, the emphasis on education remained the same, as did the intention to have scholars shoulder the important responsibilities of the country. What is regrettable is that they only knew to emphasize moral principles and textual exegesis, without studying practical learning. Moreover, they put the two areas of physical training, archery and charioteering, out of their minds. Therefore, for thousands of years, culture, industry, and commerce have not developed substantially, but have stagnated midway. By the late Qing Dynasty, the sea ban was widely lifted, and European and American countries, with their strong armies and advanced products, simultaneously invaded and dumped goods, like mercury seeping into the ground, entering every crack. The shortcomings of our country's original education system were completely exposed at this point, and it became necessary to make major improvements in order to adapt to the environment. Therefore, prominent officials at the time, such as Zeng Wenzheng, Grand Tutor Park, and Li Wenzhong, among others, successively sent students abroad to study science. Later, Zhang Wenxiang put forward the saying "[Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application]," hoping to achieve integration and establish something truly significant. The imperial examination system, which was popular in the past, was decisively abolished, and schools that suited the trend were established one after another. Counting on our fingers, there are already less than a hundred years of history. Although the scale is roughly established, its achievements are still far from ideal. Especially in recent years, with the decline of discipline and the slackening of study, everything feels like it is going downhill. Now, I will list the major pathological states below:</p>
<p>One, From the perspective of schools: Since the incident occurred, people from all over the country have moved to Shanghai, and schools are no exception. Moreover, with the changes of the times and the confluence of opportunities, newly established schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Therefore, there are as many schools in Shanghai as there are crucian carp crossing the river, especially primary and secondary schools. However, examining their content, most are simple and crude, mainly focusing on business considerations. As for those that teach earnestly and have complete equipment, it can be said that less than one in ten are like this. For example, physical and chemical experiments require sufficient instruments and machinery and actual experimentation. The study of social sciences requires abundant reference books and a large library. However, the old ones have either been destroyed in wars or damaged long ago. Moreover, due to the interruption of sources and the high cost, replenishment is not easy to achieve. Furthermore, because of the high prices and the increasing expenses, in order to maintain the lives of teachers and the expenses of the school, the collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees naturally rises like water, increasing proportionally. However, once tuition and miscellaneous fees are expensive, the students coming to the school will also be affected accordingly. For the sake of attracting students, they have to compromise and give students various conveniences. The trend of transferring schools and skipping grades, and selling diplomas follows. In addition, the capacity of classrooms exceeds the prescribed number, the equipment of sports fields is completely lacking, the lack of transparency in school finances, and the prevalence of speculation and profiteering can be said to be one of the current pathological states of education.</p>
<p>Two, From the perspective of teachers: It can be said that teachers in our country have meager incomes and heavy responsibilities. This was the case in normal times, and it is even more so today. Affected by the high-price policy, most of the general teachers are overwhelmed by the heavy burden of family expenses, it can be said that eight or nine out of ten, and only one or two out of a hundred can maintain their family life. However, life cannot be lived without food. In the absence of any other way, they can only increase the number of teaching hours to supplement their income; if the school is insufficient, they can seek compensation from other schools. As a result, it is very common to teach more than thirty hours a week and rush between four or five schools. This is not only the case for primary and secondary school teachers, but also for university professors. However, personal spirit is not infinite, and one's expertise is also limited; because of the large number of hours taken on, the explanation is inevitably loose, and there is no mood to grade papers. From the students' point of view, the benefits are inevitably reduced, but from the teachers' point of view, they are already sweating profusely and exhausted. After returning home, they have to rest earlier, and there is absolutely no time or courage to study. However, learning is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat. Moreover, the world's trends are constantly in turmoil and evolution. If you cannot catch up, you will become outdated, which can be said to be the second of the current pathological states of education.</p>
<p>Three, From the perspective of students: Students are the future masters of the country, and the relationship is of great importance. When studying at school, they should concentrate and strive to be diligent and industrious, exercise their bodies, and study their subjects, in order to make more contributions to the country. However, our country's science is originally backward, and in recent years, because of the difficulties of life, most parents have already felt that they are at the end of their rope and are in a terrible state for the seven things needed to start a day, and except for a few exceptions, they can be said to be unable to do anything about their children's education expenses, and their love is unable to help, let alone the tuition fees are increasing day by day, so the number of students is decreasing day by day. Not to mention universities, the situation in primary and secondary schools is also the same, what a profound crisis this is! Not only that, but among the students at school, those who can truly study for the sake of studying can be said to be rare; the poor are mostly distracted by family affairs, and the rich are subdued by love, regarding the school as a decoration, as a title, only seeking to graduate as soon as possible, so that they can get by in society. Therefore, the trend of transferring schools and skipping grades, and buying diplomas is very prevalent. The level of proficiency is rapidly declining. Even students who fail in School A go to School B and are promoted by two grades, and many students who have not graduated from high school are studying at university. From the school's point of view, in order to cope with the environment and increase income, it has to have its difficulties. From the students' point of view, it is not too much to blame them for taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain qualifications as soon as possible, but from the country's point of view, the general level of knowledge of students is declining day by day, how can they shoulder the important task of building and restoring the country. From the social point of view, the opening of this trend is enough to have a bad influence and reduce the faith in schools, which can be said to be the third of the current pathological states of education.</p>
<p>Four, From the perspective of the country: Developing education and cultivating talents is originally the special responsibility of the country, so the great powers allocate educational funds generously and actively carry out the elimination of illiteracy. Since the funding for schools is quite generous, and the equipment is quite complete, it can gain the faith of society and produce good results. Since the income of teachers is rich and their lives are quite stable, they can avoid changing their minds and regard it as a lifelong career. Our country has never attached importance to education funds in normal times, let alone today, when the country is in a state of war and military letters are flying around, it can be said that it is not surprising that education funds cannot be generously allocated! Therefore, except for national or public schools, the education authorities and the school authorities can be said to have no contact. The subsidies of the past have long been abolished, and the nominal inspections are equal to formalities. The two sides are as unrelated as horses and oxen in the wind. Not only that, but the education authorities, even for national or public schools, also issue insufficient funds or arrears of several months due to financial difficulties. Due to the financial difficulties of education, it is difficult to be strict with the supervision of schools, so everything is not on track and is becoming increasingly corrupt, which can be said to be inevitable, which can be said to be the fourth of the current pathological states of education.</p>
<p>According to the above, it can be seen that there are many reasons for the current pathological state of education in our country, and they are mutually cyclical and mutually causal, resulting in today's situation, and the reason why education in our country can be maintained without falling is the support of enthusiastic people in society. For example, the scholarship of Shen Bao, the loan of Xinwen Bao, and the scholarship of Uncle Ping are particularly famous. They either invite powerful and enthusiastic people in society to donate, or they pay out of their own pockets, all of which are well-managed and have outstanding reputations. Hearing the news, there are the scholarships of the Guangdong, Hubei, Changzhou, and Shaoxing fellow villagers associations, and the number of students who have received assistance is no less than tens of thousands, which is really a grand event that should be written about in detail. What is regrettable is that the establishment of this type of scholarship can only supervise students, and the standard for admission is based on the students' academic performance. As for the schools and teachers, they are not asked, which is inevitably biased. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the amount of money, it is still impossible to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. Therefore, I am not talented, and I will briefly list a few important adjustment methods below:</p>
<p>First, what the education authorities should be responsible for can be divided into nine points as follows: (1) They should generously allocate education funds so that those engaged in education can be free from the pressure of life and be able to concentrate on education. Continued on the second page of the special issue.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Essay Contest Results</h3>
<p>Our newspaper recently held two essay contests: one on tax revenue issues, and the other on National Day commemoration. The former discussed the reorganization of old taxes and the increase of new tariffs, in order to enrich municipal finances and adjust the treatment of military police and public officials. The latter discussed the issue of educational innovation, in order to strengthen the plan to cultivate people. We are very grateful to the readers for their enthusiastic contributions and for expressing their opinions. However, due to the limited number of admissions, there are inevitably regrets for the pearls that have been missed. The list of admissions is now listed below.</p>

Also, please send the seals of Ceng Yun, Lu Zhenglin, and Chen Honghao to the editor-in-chief's office of this newspaper for verification and issuance of remuneration.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Continued from the first page of the special issue: (2) Establish national or public elementary schools and compel children to attend, so that illiteracy can be reduced day by day; (3) Establish more practical schools such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine, to benefit our country's economic construction; (4) Establish more vocational supplementary schools and night schools to benefit the continuing education of young people in their spare time; (5) Strictly supervise private schools, and promptly ban those that are poorly managed or corrupt the atmosphere; (6) Increase the salaries of teachers, strictly screen them, and stipulate the number of teaching hours per week, so that they can work wholeheartedly and not mislead the children; (7) Implement a unified examination system to improve the level of students; (8) Make efforts to provide special allocations for faculty and staff, and it is best to handle it separately according to the population of the teacher's family, so that it is fair; (9) There should be clear regulations for the collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees for schools at all levels.</p>
<p>Second, what the school authorities should be responsible for can be divided into seven points as follows: (1) The finances should be absolutely transparent, and the salaries of teachers should be paid entirely from the income from tuition fees. If it is possible to use this to handle in-kind payments for teachers, that would be best, but it is absolutely not allowed to engage in speculation and hoarding; (2) All equipment should be as complete as possible within the possible range, in order to benefit the students' studies, especially the light in the classrooms and the capacity of the students should be carefully considered, and should not be done carelessly; (3) The selection and removal of teachers must be strict, and the diligence and laziness of teachers should also be investigated; (4) School teachers should be full-time in principle. Primary and secondary school teachers should not teach more than 20 hours per week, and university professors should not teach more than 12 hours per week, in order to facilitate grading papers and continuing education after class; (5) The management of students must be strict, and the trend of transferring schools, skipping grades, and selling diplomas should be jointly banned to maintain the reputation of the school; (6) The whole school should often hold important subject examinations or speech competitions to encourage students' interest; (7) The collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees should take into account the ability of parents.</p>
<p>Third, what teachers should pay attention to can be divided into four points below: First, classes should start and end on time, and the explanations should be clear, and the attitude should be sincere, so that students can gain faith; second, the number of hours teachers teach per week, whether in primary and secondary schools or universities, should be limited, and they should not be greedy, so that they have the opportunity to continue their studies and not become outdated; third, teachers should teach exclusively in one school in principle, and if it is absolutely necessary to teach part-time, it should be limited to one school, so that the spirit can be focused and there is enough time; fourth, they should use summer or winter vacations to carry out tutoring or travel to enrich their knowledge. If the income of teachers can maintain a family life, all problems will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Fourth, what students should pay attention to can also be divided into several points as follows: First, they should study practical subjects, and if they do not understand something, they should ask in detail and not let it pass vaguely; second, they should exercise their bodies more, so-called strengthening the body can also strengthen the country; third, they should encourage good character and strive to be complete people, and they should especially prohibit absenteeism and asking for leave; fourth, they must not transfer schools, skip grades, or buy diplomas in order to seek quick success. Although this may be a small benefit at present, if the basic knowledge is not sufficient, they will not be able to pursue advanced studies, and when they enter society in the future, they will feel the lack of knowledge, and it will be too late to regret it!</p>
<p>Looking at the world's great powers, the reason why they have reached today's status can be said to be starting from the development of education. If you want to develop education, you must have sufficient funds and excellent talents. The reason why education in our country is not easy to manage well can also be said to be affected by funds and talents, and in today's situation, it can be clearly recognized. It is hoped that the education authorities can generously allocate funds, employ talents, and be able to consider reducing tuition fees, then there is hope for the development of education in our country!</p>
<h3>My Views on the Current Educational Reform Issues</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuocai</p>
<p>To discuss what the current educational problems are, one must first understand what the goal of education is. Speaking of educational goals, from ancient times to the present, Chinese and foreign educators have all had their say. Due to word count limitations, it is not convenient to introduce them one by one. Here, the training objectives of middle schools, which are located in the central hub of the school system and connect the upper and lower levels, are used as a reference for us to examine the current educational problems: 1. To cultivate strong physical fitness. 2. To cultivate civic morality. 3. To cultivate national culture. 4. To enrich biological and vital knowledge and skills. 5. To cultivate a scientific foundation. 6. To develop labor habits. 7. To stimulate artistic interests. The above seven points, although encompassing society, the individual, material things, culture, morality, knowledge, skills, language, science, and art, can be summarized into four categories: health, vocation, citizenship, and leisure. Health includes the preservation of life and health; vocation includes the use of tools, symbols, and other special skills required in civilized life and practical business, to enhance work efficiency; citizenship includes the individual's restraint and coordination with society, and cooperation and participation in group activities; leisure includes the use of free time to make life more uplifting and fulfilling. If the goal of education is like this, then what is the current state of education, the general education situation in Shanghai today? To what extent are health education, vocational training, civic education, and leisure activity training implemented in schools? It is undeniable that most schools, due to simple equipment, substandard school buildings, lack of qualified teachers, lackluster school management, and poor teaching interest, reduce educational efficiency and even achieve the opposite effect, much like a patient who consults a quack doctor and takes the wrong medicine, not only failing to cure the disease but also deepening it or turning it into an incurable terminal illness. So, is all this responsibility on the shoulders of those running the schools and the teachers? No! We cannot place all the blame on the teachers. The majority of the responsibility still lies with the various members of society and the authorities responsible for educational administration. Teachers are only responsible for the actual work, much like the bricklayers, carpenters, painters, and laborers who build houses. I ask, can these craftsmen, with their bare hands, build skyscrapers? Furthermore, do all school-age children in Shanghai and other places have the opportunity to attend school? If we do not eliminate the 80% illiteracy rate, can a small number of scholar-officials save the country and build the nation? In short, the problem lies in [economics], the problem of education funding, which cannot be universally solved by a few philanthropists. Every member of society must treat education with enthusiasm, and the government authorities with the power of educational administration should also vigorously raise funds for education, strive to promote it, and take on the responsibility of supervision and leadership. Then, there will be nothing that cannot be achieved. Since the cause of education is the foundation for national prosperity and national survival, the cause of education should be directly managed by the state, planned comprehensively, so as to achieve the expected effect of uniformity. Private schools are always inevitably scattered, lax, and each doing its own thing, resulting in a shop-like situation that is shocking. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, the center of economy and culture. Although it has not lost its position in this wartime state, practically speaking, with Shanghai's talent and wealth, what difficulty is there in achieving ideal goals by devoting itself to education? I hereby offer my sincere suggestions, discussing matters as they stand, for the reference of those who are reforming current education. 1. Add public schools. Given the size of Shanghai and its large population, compared to the existing number of public school students and the number of students in the city, there is a huge disparity. Therefore, under the current circumstances, if it is not possible to establish them universally, public schools should be added in appropriate locations. These schools, whether in teaching methods, school administration, school equipment, or training implementation, should be models for private schools of each level in each region. Tuition and miscellaneous fees should be waived across the board. The principal is the head of a school and is related to the success or failure of a school. Therefore, the selection of principals should be carefully selected. Those who do not have a spirit of service and practical educational experience should not be appointed. 2. Rectify private schools. Because public schools are scarce, private schools have emerged in response to social needs, so that school-age children have places to study, and the foundation of the country can continue. This should be credited to many private school organizers who are enthusiastic about education. However, today, there are indeed many who are truly educating for the sake of education, but there are also not a few who treat education as a business, using it to obtain profits and suddenly become wealthy. Moreover, many schools have narrow school buildings, polluted air, dark light, and simple equipment, which affects the health of students; teachers are of poor quality and lack spirit, which affects students' academics and character; the board of directors exists in name only and not in reality, and funding relies entirely on tuition fees and is not disclosed; if there are too few students, there is multi-grade teaching; if there are too many students, the classroom is crowded, regardless of the teacher's energy or whether the students can benefit. All of this inevitably misleads the children and destroys the pillars of the country. How can we not rectify it and make mistakes in the future? The method of rectification should first determine the principles of rectification: excellent schools should be commended, corrupt schools should be banned or ordered to improve. 3. Cultivate educational talents. The so-called educational talents refer to the cultivation of educational personnel who are responsible for supervising and guiding the development of education. Graduates from the education departments of various universities who have participated in practical teaching work for several years before and after their studies, or normal school graduates with more than five years of educational experience who have received short-term training, are most suitable to be educational administrative cadres. One is a teacher who is directly responsible for education. In addition to having expertise in a specialty, secondary school teachers should be nurtured by educational courses and have a full understanding of educational principles, educational philosophy, secondary education, and various psychologies, teaching materials, and teaching methods. As for the original secondary school teachers, they should use holidays or self-study methods to improve themselves. Primary school teachers should be trained in normal schools as a principle. At present, there is a lack of teachers. Normal schools should be added or classes expanded, and non-normal school graduates among the original teachers should be tested and identified, removing the dross and keeping the essence. Elementary teachers should be selected from outstanding junior high school graduates who have received one year of teacher training (simplified normal school method) to fill the position. All living expenses of normal school students are provided by the school to show preferential treatment. In addition to cultivating teaching skills, training methods are also important in teacher training. Attention should be paid to the teacher's own academic and moral cultivation to create excellent teachers. The times are advancing, and learning is endless. Assistance and encouragement should be given to the original teachers' further studies. Teachers who are ambitious and work-study should be given various conveniences and assistance. 4. Stabilize teachers' lives. Teachers' lives have always been known to be poor, and today, they are even poorer. No wonder many teachers, tormented by life, abandon their chalk and seek other development. Some who are steadfast can barely maintain their lives, and are particularly interested in educational work; some are single and only need to take care of themselves; some want to do business, but have no capital and no recommendation to join other industries. They cannot get out, and they have to take care of their children. However, we must pay attention that in a situation where salaries are increased every half year and prices rise day and night, if teachers' lives continue to be so poor, teachers who can barely maintain their lives will eventually not be able to maintain them; teachers who are particularly interested in educational work will also find it difficult to work on an empty stomach; single men will also have to start a family one day. When the cloth gown has to be taken off and the children have to be taken care of, they will also leave the school and seek another livelihood. At that time, who else would be willing to enter normal school and become a normal school student preparing to change careers? What kind of people will be responsible for the important task of education at that time? Of course, it will be a group of mediocre and incompetent outsiders who fill the ranks. It is not difficult to imagine what stage the education cause will reach. Not to mention the future, even in reality, the number of people who have not received teacher training and have no teaching ability and are acting as teachers is increasing day by day. Isn't this a major crisis? If we want to revitalize the spirit of teachers, develop an interest in educational work, and enhance educational effectiveness, we must first stabilize the lives of teachers. The high hats of [purity], [sacredness], and [longevity] can no longer be worn on the heads of smart and capable teachers who are freezing and starving. The specific measures to stabilize teachers' lives, as far as I can see, are described below: A. Increase salary standards. Public schools should calculate monthly according to the cost of living index. Private schools should disclose their finances and use more than 70% of the school's total income as salaries for all school teachers and staff. Salary standards should be divided into different grades according to the amount of classwork and the complexity of the work. The maximum difference should not exceed 50% of the lowest salary. For middle schools that use the minute system, 24 periods per week are calculated as one full-time teacher. B. Schools provide accommodation for teachers. Teachers living on campus can reduce the waste of time and transportation costs on the road. At the same time, it is reassuring and convenient for handling school affairs and classwork. The environment is pure, and common learning can also achieve the benefits of collective wisdom. The solution to the teacher accommodation problem will surely increase educational efficiency. C. Special rationing of daily necessities. Teachers serve the public and the country, and their treatment should be the same as ordinary civil servants. During the implementation of the wartime controlled economic policy, the government should allocate daily necessities to each teacher and their direct relatives according to actual consumption, such as rice (special rice allocation, which the authorities are working on), briquettes, oil, salt, sugar, and clothing, to reduce worries about life. Then, teachers will no longer always think about the firewood problem at home in the classroom. D. Exemption from self-defense corps service. The Baojia organization is to protect local security, and young people of the age of self-defense corps service should have the obligation to serve and seek local security together. However, teachers have a heavy responsibility for educating children and heavy workload. In their spare time, they have to correct homework and handle miscellaneous affairs. Therefore, they should be treated preferentially and allowed to be exempted from service. 5. Subsidize private school funding. Schools with very abundant funding do not need subsidies, but most private schools have tight funding, which makes everything simple and unable to do anything. The situation should be considered and various subsidies should be given to ensure that some educational schools are no longer in a precarious position and encounter abandonment halfway, or affect the educational spirit and the physical and mental development of students. 6. Support poor students. It is too early to say. But we also have ways to support poor students, such as instructing private schools at all levels to set a few percent of free quotas and half-fee quotas, exempting tuition fees, and having the government supply news or encouraging various public groups to bear the burden separately; or designating more complete private schools to specifically recruit free students or half-fee students, and all expenses are allocated by the government according to the expenses of public schools. (That is, the previous substitute method) Among these poor students, if there are particularly outstanding students, in addition to completing elementary education, they should be promoted to middle school and university at public expense. 7. Reward private school founders. Education is best run directly by the state. When the economy is unable to do it all, people from all walks of life should be responsible for working together to ensure that every school-age child has the opportunity to be educated. The government should reward those who donate funds to build schools, or record them in books, or erect monuments for them, or give them items as souvenirs, or make them famous in the world, so as to create an atmosphere in society where private individuals donate funds to build schools. Public groups that donate funds to build schools should be commended in the same way. 8. Establish compulsory schools. Compulsory schools, in addition to not charging any fees, also provide books and stationery. In this kind of school, writing and calculation are the most important courses (that is, the three Rs). Therefore, it is most appropriate to have half-day classes to meet the principle of economy. Students are recruited from poor children who cannot afford to go to school on their own, and who must assist in school affairs, or have fixed jobs, or run small businesses. Thus, the unfortunate children who have always been rejected outside the school gate can also have the opportunity to study. 9. Value health education. [Great achievements reside in a healthy body]; [To strengthen the country, first strengthen the race]; [Health is the key to happiness]. These are all truths. Since we understand the importance of health, we should pay more attention to health education, and the depth of our attention should be above academics. I ask, in addition to focusing on academics, do school administrations pay attention to the health of students? We can no longer let students be locked up in classrooms and study to death. Health facilities should be held more and more, and the environment that hinders the health of students should be improved one by one. Municipal public gymnasiums should also be opened more and more. As for leisure activities that are beneficial to physical and mental health, they should also be promoted more and more, so as to replace improper entertainment. 10. Enhance the inspection system. The connection and close cooperation between schools and the administrative authorities should be fully responsible by the supervisors who are in charge of the inspection work. The inspection of the supervisors has the positive construction and the passive improvement. The promotion of educational efficiency depends on how the supervisors' inspection work is done. Therefore, the educational administrative authorities should value and enhance the supervisors' inspection system. Furthermore, due to the importance of the inspection work, supervisors should not be selected unless they have a spirit of service, more than five years of practical teaching experience, excellent results, and new ideas. If the supervisor district system is implemented, it will be even more appropriate to have full-time supervisors for teaching, training, general affairs, and health.</p>
<h3>Security Funding and Tax Revenue Consolidation and Increase</h3>
<p>— Wei Mou</p>
<p>The war has reached a decisive stage, and strengthening political power has become an urgent task. The only characteristic of victorious politics is that all facilities of the government can deeply win the hearts of the people, so as to establish outstanding prestige. In peacetime, the existence of the government plays a great role in the economic development of the country. The production, distribution, consumption, and exchange of wealth are all affected by the government. Because the government's security duties can maintain social justice and security, people's lives and property can be guaranteed, and social order can be kept quiet. All of this is necessary for production. In order to increase economic production and enrich the lives of the people, it is necessary to consolidate local security at any time. When the country is at war, local security is even more important. In order to enhance the power of war and strengthen the belief in victory, if local security cannot be maintained, the people will not be able to live and work in peace and contentment, let alone other things. Conversely, if the people's lives can be free from worry due to good security, then the people will have a special affection for the government, and the political foundation will inevitably become stronger. The maintenance of security agencies requires huge funding. If funding is not sufficient, administrative efficiency cannot be achieved. If salaries are not sufficient, the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained. Taking Shanghai as an example, the security agencies include public servants, police, and security team service personnel. Their current treatment is too meager. Although Shanghai has established a police cooperative and increased special allocations, life is still difficult to solve. If their lives cannot be reasonably adjusted, the future of social security is worrying, and evil deeds such as extortion, fraud, blackmail, excessive collection, and embezzlement cannot be eradicated. Passive repeated orders and spiritual training cannot stop the continuation of corrupt politics. The fundamental way to implement clean politics is to solve their living problems, that is, to make them full. Only after they are full can the people be full. To make them full, their real income must be increased, so that they can take on the important task of security, and the people's model and example can also be established from this. The source of all expenses is income, and the government's main income is tax revenue. Increasing tax revenue can be done by adding new taxes and increasing old tax rates. It can also be done by consolidating old taxes. Consolidating taxes is a stable way to increase tax revenue. It does not disturb the people, but can make tax revenue move towards self-discipline, economy, and progress. The increase in security funding is nothing more than the application of tax consolidation and tax increase. After financial consolidation, income will inevitably increase and funding will be enriched. Then, the salaries of public servants, police, and security teams will be fully increased to stabilize their lives. If it is still not enough, it is better to make up for it by increasing taxes. How to consolidate taxes and increase taxes, I will express my opinions as follows: 1. Abolish the tax contract system. The emergence of the tax contract system was originally a temporary measure because the organization of financial institutions was not perfect and tax revenue could not be abandoned. The tax contract system itself has many shortcomings. Those who obtain the contracting rights often have relatives or fellow villagers with the tax authorities, or they get it by being good at flattering. Contractors naturally take a purely profit-oriented view of tax contracts. When collecting taxes, they not only use commercial means but also rely on special forces to collect taxes. The contracted amount is often far less than the actual amount collected. Therefore, the benefit to the government is very small. The biggest regret in Shanghai's finances now is the existence of the tax contract system, which is not allowed to exist for a sound tax system. Shanghai's financial institutions are not flexible and not sound. A unified collection method should be adopted to enrich Shanghai's income. 2. Prevent illegal tax evasion. Illegal tax evasion is a type of tax evasion. The benefits obtained by tax evaders are the losses suffered by the government. Therefore, the financial authorities should prevent illegal tax evasion. Shanghai's current special consumption tax is paid by the merchants themselves, and tax evasion occurs from time to time. The initiators of tax evasion are merchants or consumers. Merchants often exempt consumers from taxes in order to attract customers. Sometimes merchants conceal reports for profit, and even collude with tax collectors to evade taxes. Preventing the evasion of special consumption taxes can also increase Shanghai's tax revenue. The methods to prevent the evasion of special consumption taxes are: 1. Issuing special consumption tax tickets; 2. Adopting uniform invoices, and the financial authorities can strictly check the account books of various stores. In this way, tax evasion can be prevented, and merchants and the people will know to self-check, and tax revenue will not be lacking. 3. Abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes and consolidate the land tax. When the political situation is chaotic, the only characteristic of local finances is the heavy burden of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. In recent years, the Chinese countryside has been affected by the war and has also increased many miscellaneous taxes. The payment of land tax is still light, but the additional miscellaneous taxes are really unbearable for farmers. The existence of miscellaneous taxes not only indicates the corruption of local politics, but is also the source of all disasters. In Shanghai's finances, the income from land tax also occupies an important position. However, the various miscellaneous taxes and harsh taxes in the rural areas near Shanghai include township fees, garrison fuel supply fees, military and police lamp oil fees, garrison food allowances, troop transit reception fees, military and police rice allowances, police officer uniform fees, defense construction fees, and residence permit fees. They not only violate the principle of tax certainty, but also extremely disrupt the rural economy. To increase the income from land tax, harsh and miscellaneous taxes must first be abolished. Regarding the consolidation of land tax, in addition to adhering to the consistent policy and stepping up the implementation of land registration and land survey, which are both fundamental and symptomatic, it is especially important to revise the scientific principles and adjust the tax rates to suit the current socio-economic environment. 4. Thoroughly reform financial administration. The reform of financial administration is closely related to the entire tax revenue. Now, Shanghai's financial administration needs to be thoroughly reformed. The most obvious manifestation is the issue of discipline among tax personnel. No one admits that there is no need for reform. The discipline of tax personnel is only one aspect of financial administration. If financial administration can be thoroughly reformed, then other small problems can be easily solved. The focus of reforming financial administration is the rational adjustment of people and money, and the establishment of a good system for people and money. Establishing a civil service system and a public treasury system is what Shanghai's financial administrative organs must achieve now. First, establish a civil service system: the so-called system does not mean ignoring the conditions of people. Governing people and governing the law should be given equal importance, and neither is indispensable. Regarding the establishment of the civil service system, the purpose is to select outstanding talents to carry out affairs and ensure their stable lives and secure positions. All financial administrative personnel, even if they are truly talented, must be drawn from objective standards, so that they come from the way of examination and training. After serving, all performance evaluations, promotions, guarantees, and pensions are formulated into rules and regulations, so that there is an objective standard to rely on. All talents are not promoted based on personal feelings, but based on the system, not based on subjective preferences, but based on objective standards. Second, establish a public treasury system. The fundamental spirit of the public treasury system is that tax collectors do not handle money. Taxpayers should directly pay into the national treasury after the tax collection agency investigates and approves the tax amount. There is an idiom in our country, "[passing through the hands, three parts fat]" means that as long as you are an official and handle banknotes, even if you are not corrupt, you can still have a wide hand and get some oil and water. If the public treasury system is strictly implemented, the tax collectors will not handle banknotes, and there is no opportunity for embezzlement and enrichment at all, and tax corruption cannot be done. If the Shanghai Municipal Government can consider the situation and implement the public treasury system universally and completely, then there is a great guarantee for the increase in tax revenue. The above is the method of consolidating taxes. To increase Shanghai's financial income, the above four items must be fully achieved. The methods for increasing taxes are described below: Increase retail donation: Retail donation is a type of consumption tax, and its income is very elastic and very common. Therefore, if you want to increase taxes, it is better to increase retail donation. The original tax rate for retail donation was 4%, of which 2% was paid to the central government, and the remaining 2% was local income. In order to increase Shanghai's local security funding, the retail donation tax rate can be increased to 6%, of which 2% is fully used for local security funding. In order to prevent misappropriation, a special fund can be set up for safekeeping. In order for Shanghai to become a national political model area, the maintenance of security must be strengthened. To strengthen security, security funding must be increased. The way to raise funds is through tax consolidation and tax increase. What is discussed now is detailed in tax consolidation and simplified in tax increase. This is not a bias on one side. I believe that there must first be tax consolidation and then tax increase can be implemented. Otherwise, the old tax will still not be consolidated, and only tax increase is planned. The people's burden is increased and the tax revenue will not be increased in a reasonable proportion.</p>
<h3>Review of Tax Increases and Tax Collection Methods</h3>
<p>— Cengyun</p>
<p>Finance is what all people desire and what governance requires. If the people's wealth can be used to manage the people's affairs, and all policies can be implemented with impartiality, then the government and the people will both benefit, and there will be no shortage of funds. There will be no increases to budgeted amounts, and practical use will not be excessive. Taking from the people and distributing to the people, both fairly and transparently, will foster trust between the government and the governed. All advanced countries operate in this way. If taxes are low, national funds will inevitably be insufficient. Officials cannot be expected to ruin their families to relieve the nation or exhaust their private resources to serve the public. Ultimately, they will still have to take from the people, but outside of regular taxes, this will turn into hidden regulations and endless embezzlement, seeking exceptions in every way, cleverly seizing and arbitrarily levying taxes, many times more than the regular tax. The government gains nothing, while the common people suffer the harm. Even among public servants in the same tax collection agency, those without the power to handle disbursements appear incompetent. In today's environment of expensive goods, those who must remain honest on their monthly salary are essentially working on an empty stomach. Those who enrich themselves are full of ill-gotten gains, as if it were their due. I personally believe it is better to thoroughly investigate and openly increase taxes.</p>
<p>Consider the tax increases in this city. At a time when civil servants and police officers are not adequately compensated, if the city treasury is not balanced with the district treasury taxes, the monthly loss is approximately 60 million. This is why tax increases cannot be delayed any longer. The Baojia (community policing) donation was initiated after the annual budget was already set, so it was organized separately. The amounts set, such as ten yuan per month for dependent households and thirty yuan for primary households, are collected by the Jia chiefs on a per-household basis. The amounts are appropriate, easy to collect, and the burden on the people is relatively equal. This can be continued next year. Property tax has already been increased by 60 percent. The valuation for determining the tax amount is based on the building's construction and facilities, as well as the location's accessibility, to determine the amount. Land tax has not yet been increased. If it were also increased by 60 percent, its valuation could also be based on the quality of the environment and the accessibility of transportation to determine the different grades. This is something that urgently needs to be implemented. The increased amount will be fairly distributed between the rich and the poor. Moreover, prosperous areas in this city account for the majority, so the amount of tax increases will differ greatly from rural areas. The total amount of the increase should be substantial.</p>
<p>Consider the methods of tax collection that urgently need to be investigated, such as the consumption tax on vendors and small shops. There are no accounts to verify; even if there are rough accounts, they are illegible and their authenticity cannot be determined. Either the officials embezzle, or the merchants do, or they share the profits, with the merchants taking seven parts and the officials taking three. It would be better to adopt a contracted tax method, such as for traders of antiques, jade, and other objects who have no accounts to verify and use oral agreements. Each trade association should estimate the amount, submit it to the relevant authorities for approval, and the merchants should pay the tax accordingly. This is also a way to investigate and reduce corruption. Consider that the tax collection agencies under the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau continue to use the precedents from before the incidents, establishing inspectors and supervisors. For example, stamp tax has regular inspections, or quarterly inspections. Although the methods are not as complete as before, they still retain their concrete and minor functions. The inspections are conducted jointly with the local district police, but the deliberation on penalties has lost the previous good method of joint discussion with police officers. However, spot checks on field staff, verification of shop guarantees, and thorough investigation of public complaints against illegal acts by officials are all the exclusive duties of inspectors and supervisors. This is also a good system for investigating long-standing malpractices and preventing illegal activities. It is recently learned that the newly established Special Tax Office of this city was established on September 16, with sections for investigation, survey, review, and management. After this rectification, and prohibiting merchants from taking advantage of loopholes, it should not let the previous good methods be the only ones. The way to manage finances is simply to circulate wealth and implement fair policies. There is no other way. When the country clearly knows that national funds are insufficient, yet is content with collecting little, it is because when starting anew, the people's trust has not yet been cultivated, and when at peace, the nation's treasury has not yet been depleted. When the situation is not yet critical, the laws are not changed. Today, we are in a time of many events and face a difficult situation, so what are we waiting for to change? To sit idly by and watch the slackening of governance, the poverty of the government, and the distress of officials, while remaining indifferent, like the physician Bian Que looking at superficial ailments. The troubles of society will become deeper and deeper over time. Alas!</p>
