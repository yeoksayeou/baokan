<p>社評</p>
<h3>從低處入手　大學畢業生地擇業問題</h3>
<p>畢業考試完畢，畢業論文寫就，一般大學生就將離開學校，投身社會去服務了。在社會事業一切落後的中國，謀職業是相當困難的，戰前大家都說「畢業即事業」，這個困難情形到現在更明顯。可是，切莫灰心，路是人走出來的，機會是要自己去找的，絕不是天上掉下來的，祗要你有心去找，你總有一日達到目的。而最重要的，就是，你切不可自持太高。</p>
<p>在中國，能夠受大學敎育的，在全國人數中佔極少數部份，大學畢業生自然值得尊貴，值得看重。可是，切不可存心以為從大學校裏所得到的知識，已經足夠社會上的應用，要知道大學裏所學的，不過是研究學術應付事務的方法。大學畢業生要利用這些方法，繼續去求知識，那末，這些知識方才是活的，這些知識方才是個人和社會所需要的知識。所以大學畢業以後的主要工作，就在應用新方法等求活知識。離校之後，社會上的人，個個都是敎授，社會上的事，件件都是課本。因此，就學時期，在學校裏學習，就業時期，在社會上學習，所謂「學到老，學不了」，學習的心理，沒有停止，事業的成功亦永無止境。</p>
<p>抱着學習的心理去求職業，那末，低微的地位，渺小的工作，處處都是學習的機會，這些並且都是社會的基礎，對於初入社會的人，更值得重視。所以，文科畢業的不妨做抄寫，做校對，商科畢業的不妨做店員，做助理員，工科畢業的不妨做練習生，做繪圖員，敎育科畢業的不妨做小學敎員。就以文科來講，有本領撰寫文章做編輯工作的人，做校對做抄寫並不降落你的身份，反之，從抄寫校對工作裏更可增加學習機會，更可看到許多先進人士的工作。而且從小事情小職務起始，踏進一個機關；踏進了這個機關，然後有發揮本領的機會，目下社會需要眞實人才如是的殷切，假如是眞實本領的，社會上決不埋沒你，你也不必寫着恐懼埋沒而發愁，文科如此，其他各科的畢業生都是如此。</p>
<p>抱着學習心理去就職業，目的在乎學習，所以祗要職業的性質和本身的個性符合，和平素學習的科門符合，其他一切先都不要顧慮。切不可存地位高低的心思，因為「搞不成，低不就」最是大學畢業生就業的大毛病。切不可存工作勞逸的心思，因為安閒的工作最是阻礙一個青年人的上進。偉大的事業都是一點一滴的基礎工作發展而來，偉大的成功都要經過一步步艱苦的奮鬥而方能達到。世界上沒有僥倖的事，在全世界正在決戰時期，更不容許任何人投機取巧。投機取巧成功於一時，決不能維持於永久。只有腳＼脚踏實地，繼續奮鬥，不斷上進的人，然後能創造最偉大的事業，獲得最偉大的成功。</p>
<h3>馬利亞納島附近　日機隊重創敵軍</h3>
<p>沉毀敵各種艦船二十余艘</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午五時四十分發表：　來襲塞班島之敵軍，於六月十五日下午奪取該島之一角後，即　次增强兵力，日守備部隊當即要擊，已予以重創。　出現於馬利亞納羣島附近之敵，乃以航空母艦及戰艦為主幹之大機動部隊，敵方現已將太平洋方面艦隊之大部集中於該方面，日航空部隊正連日攻擊敵機動部隊中。　自六月十二日迄本日止。判明之職果如次：甲、擊沉敵戰艦一般，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一艘，潛水艇一艘。乙。炸毀敵航空母艦四艘以上，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦四艘。運輸船八艘及船型未詳者一艘。丙、擊落敵機三百餘架，又敵方船舶及飛機亦有相當損失。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央電　美海軍部十九日下午七時二十分發表：日、美兩軍曾於十八日在塞班島海上，展開太平洋上空前之空戰。</p>
<h3>日大本營昨發表　攻陷長沙及醴陵　河南日軍準備次期作戰</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午三時發表：　湖南方面作戰之日軍部隊，十八日晚將長沙醴陵完全攻陷，刻正繼續於該地附近掃蕩殘敗敵，同渝軍開始作戰迄今，已告潰滅之敵兵力，共約十五師。　河南方面日軍部隊，本月上旬於陝縣西方地區，擊潰渝第十一戰區敗殘部隊及第八戰區軍所屬之六個軍，使其向潼關方面潰走，目下日軍正準備作次期作戰。</p>
<p>日軍某基地二十日中央社電　長沙之入日軍掌握，此為第三次，長沙形勢險要，攬岳麗山而臨湘江，且配置有某種大炮四十門之大炮陣地，成為大要塞，但在日軍勇敢豪雄之攻擊下，全未能施展。日軍於展開擊潰渝王德能不下第四軍及警編第五十四師之總攻擊戰後僅三日，至十八日下午三時半即將最重要之戰略據點攻陷，計攻擊岳麗山之日軍部隊，十八日上午七時前，以夜間奇襲之戰術，進迫至機關槍如狂之渝軍陣前，展開激烈之手溜彈戰，旋突入渝軍陣地，展開極為淒慘之白刃戰。日軍砲隊更對長沙市內之渝軍約二師大肆　擊，日軍攻略市街之部隊，於十七長南方及由東南方陸續突入市內，十八日正午進至長沙中心市街之中山西路實行巷戰，敵軍沿湘江河畔退入北部之重要碼頭，日軍對向湘江方面運走之敵軍猛加砲擊，終於午後三時半佔領明德學校及城角近傍之碼頭後，更由東南西北四方突入城內，繼續掃蕩市內殘敵，是以在第九戰區內為軍事政治經濟中樞之長紗，於茲三度歸入日軍掌握中。</p>
<p>取二重包圍　殲滅戰術</p>
<p>中國前綫基地二十日中央社電　渝軍要衝長沙，第一次陷落在民國三十年九月，前兩次在三十二年一月，前兩次之長沙進攻作戰，與此次災戰略上根本不同，前兩次之作戰，日軍僅由洞庭湖東岸向前迫進，而此次則由該湖之兩側一齊倂進，對渝第六，第九兩戰區同時進攻，一方包圍長沙，一方更以有力之機動部隊向兩戰區核心深處進擊，直搗連結長沙外廊五十餘公里之醴陵，瀏陽、湘潭、甯鄉、形成一大包圍，取二重包圍之殲滅戰術。在前兩次作戰之際，僥倖逃出之渝軍敗殘部隊，乘日軍自主撤退之後，逞勢歸還原地，當時曾大肆處偽宣傳，宛若以實力奪向此地之勢，然日軍此次作戰之結果，愈方亦自認長沙失陷，而野戰軍損失尤重，不惟無策再作虛偽宣傳，反使抗戰營又臨危機，要求英美急速援助。</p>
<p>軍事經濟上　深受打擊</p>
<p>湖南日軍前綫二十日中央社電　長沙不僅為渝方軍事上之要衝，且在經濟上亦佔重要地位，其交通有公路通川者，有鐵路由湘潭通貴州，又長沙南方之株洲，為浙贛、粵漢兩鐵道之交接點，水路則有湘江之便，北通北平，難達貴州，公路與水路寬為重慶之經濟動脈。由於渝軍恣意徵發及政治之黑暗，湖南農村極其疲弊，至今尙度其痛苦之生活，然今仍作為渝軍之兵站，担任重要任務，湖南銻鑛之出產，佔全世界產額百分之七十，他如煤鑛等資源，亦極豐富，但多未開採，長沙旣在軍事上，經濟上，佔有如此重要性，則其被日軍攻佔，渝方所受打擊之深刻，不言可喻。美國之狼狽不安，亦不難想像，預料渝方亦將引用河南作戰之成例，將作戰失敗之原因轉嫁于美國物資援助之不充分，美國對渝方之不滿，必將因此而更增大矣。</p>
<p>派遣軍幕僚　發表談話</p>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍精銳，自開始華南作戰以來，僅兩旬間，即佔領長沙，駐華派遣軍某僚獲悉日軍捷報後，特二十日在京於愈見中日記者團，發表談話如此：日派遣軍自對長沙開始作戰以來，僅兩旬間，即已完全佔領長沙，日軍於第一、第二兩次長沙作戰，攻佔長沙後，待日軍自動反轉時，渝方即奉强附會，對外宣傳日軍敗退，實施其虛偽宣傳技倆。現長沙市街一部又復入日軍手中，岳麗山嶺日軍旗再度飄揚，此時渝軍或正在散布其長沙仍在堅守之謠言，此實不值識者一笑。渝軍戰力低下，非日軍對手，早為吾人所共知，其被瞞混者，僅重慶治下之民衆及英、美一部分人士而已，日派遣軍對一城一市之佔領，向不重視，主要者在予渝野戰軍力以莫大打擊。過去每一作戰，即皆以此為目標，渝軍交戰力因是而日見低下，目前河南戰役及此次長沙攻略戰，渝軍之　敗，已足證明其無能為力矣。英美前受重慶虛言眩惑，過信重慶戰力，以為只須供予優良裝備，即足與日軍相抗衡，但最近之事實，終將使英美不得不起反省，且此次作戰，駐渝美空軍，一改其過去無能為力，僅作宣傳而不出動之舊風，誠出吾人以外，英美駐渝空軍無渝如何增强，素質如何，但僅為日軍之　滿餌食而已。此於最近日軍戰果中可明白顯示。將來英美續以近代兵品貸予渝軍，但對於崩潰前夕之重慶，終如杯水車薪，無濟於事，日派遣軍將予渝軍以痛擊，使英美之企圖化為泡影。</p>
<p>日海軍協力　作戰經過</p>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部發表（六月二十日下午四時）：日駐華海軍部隊於湖南作戰開始之同時，與陸軍部隊保持緊密連擊，刻正對敵潰滅作戰，積極進展中、自第九戰區要衝營田陷落，以至與陸軍部隊協力作戰之概要如后：</p>
<p>五月下旬編成之有力部隊，與陸軍共向某某基地進發，率先作先驅，即在岳州磊石山下流約二十餘個露出之機當，原為防備設置，經我軍冒極大之危險，排除成功，繼續向磊石山下進擊，當汩水溯航時，於高山　方面與猛烈來襲之敵機交戰，將某擊退，在敵轟炸下敢然協力陸軍，舟艇溯航於平江河附近，捕捉敗敵，予以澈底殲滅。</p>
<p>又我軍進出河泊譚上流附近，焦躁之敵機P40型十二架再度來襲，經我軍果敢應戰後，忽而遁去</p>
<p>六月上旬向新市方面開始作戰於湘江，挺身渡河，襲營田附近，某某部隊得以登陸成功，事先蟠踞於營田附近之渝軍，企圖阻止我軍　竹進擊，在江上敷設多數機雷陣等堅固防務，猛烈反擊，經我勇猛追擊作戰，續向下漂腦附近敢行掃海作業，七青山方面敗殘渝軍砲擊沉默，遂於六月六日晨攻陷營田，渝軍知營田陷落，到處轟動，敵機亦予以呼應，駕向我軍襲擊，尤其在營田至處公廟之水路開啓敵P40型機十六架來襲，我掃海部隊屢次遭遇危險，然經我猛烈砲擊，卒被驅退，依照旣定作戰，處理營田全而知頑强之防禦木棚及機雷，遂襲湘陰，節節獲舉戰果。</p>
<p>我掃海部隊目昭和十二年揚子江溯航作戰以來，作戰熟練，又新兵器之採用極為巧妙，排除若干障碍物，當時兩巖之頑敵，及來襲之敵機，為精銳之駐渝美空軍，故大為困難，隊員之士氣愈加旺盛，與陸軍緊密協力，獲舉實續，在各處展開陸海協同之美妙塲面，其間處分機雷，超過四百數十個，處分防禦木棚，數達二百六十餘，我方損害，極為輕微。</p>
<h3>怒江及密芝那區　日軍獲莫大戰果　以寡勝衆確保北緬綫陣地</h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十日中央社電　怒江及密芝那之日軍，以寡敵衆，收獲莫大戰果，四月下旬，怒江正面之渝雲南遠征軍，呼應富貢地區之攻勢，於連結騰越。龍陵、平　三綫，企圖由南方攻取怒江，經日軍全面反擊，騰越以北之敵軍，由高黎貢山脈退却，於怒江河岸，受致命打擊。日軍繼更對龍陵南部之敵軍加以攻擊，敵軍渡過怒江西進，與降落於密芝那附近之空挺部隊取得連絡，有挾擊密芝那北部之日軍之情勢，但因日軍之突擊，終成泡影，加以該地進入雨季，怒江敵軍運輸困難，陷於進退維谷之境。自怒江作戰以來，至六月十一日，敵軍之損失經判明確實者，計死傷五四一六，被俘七四，遺失迫擊砲二四，重機槍六，輕機槍七九。日方戰死三二一名，於密芝那附近，五月十七日日軍對該地之新空挺部隊及地上潛入部隊，加以迎擊，確保該陣地，粉碎敵進攻北緬陣綫之企圖。敵空軍部隊在六月十二日以前，僅於密芝那周邊即戰死二千二百名。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據合衆設重慶十九日電，渝軍當局曾於是日發表，渝軍已撤退龍陵。</p>
<p>怒江前綫二十日中央社電　怒江方面日軍，對渝雲南遠征軍之攻擊，仍屬主動地位，日軍並冒雨追動殘敗渝軍，展開激烈之掃蕩戰，十六日最於龍陵地區斃渝軍百名以上，餘均潰走。此外，在該地北方包圍轟動之渝軍，斃其騎兵百二十以上，鹵穫重迫擊砲二。機關砲二及其他彈藥甚夥。馬關方面之渝軍，由於日軍十四，十五兩日痛擊，狼狽潰退，故怒江作戰開始迄今，渝軍棄屍確已達五千五百矣。</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的討論</h3>
<p>記者經崑山、松江、蘇州而之無錫，大體擬就下面兩點加以調查研究。</p>
<p>那一種一般的米糧根本對策才適合內地實情？</p>
<p>內地的現實，需要何種青黃不接期的米糧緊急對策？</p>
<p>上述二點，實際上也就是一個不可分的問題。具體的一般的米糧根本對策，一定可以是青黃不接期的緊急對策。而從適當的青黃不接期的對策中，業發展着整個米糧年度的一般的米糧對策，不過記者痛感上海及內地在青黃不接期情勢的嚴重，故不能不特別重視青黃不接期的緊急對策。</p>
<p>關於收買米糧的根本方針，向為記者所贊同，而為記者所主張的原則。且確值那決不是上海的紙上空論。二十適應內地實情的，故不勝欣喜。然而一則以喜，一則以憂。蓋究竟怎樣應付青黃不接期的問題，還未得到明確的結論。記者當擬繼續訪問各地，如其可能，希望能由此獲得最有效的青黃不接期對策的焦點。這裏發表的各米糧集散地歷訪記，祗是關於下面諸問題的內地實情之報告，及原則的檢討。</p>
<p>一、青黃不接期對策的意義如何？</p>
<p>二、收買苦難的主要原因何在？</p>
<p>三、移動限制緩和了嗎？</p>
<p>四、所謂行政收買，是耶非耶？</p>
<p>五、米統會及下部機構應如何改革？</p>
<p>六、米糧囤積的眞相及其處置如何？</p>
<p>關於上面六項問題，記者的報告與檢討，不無在病人枕邊講醫學之感。但在人們都專注於米糧問題前途的現在，記者抽象論的報告，在正確認識這問題上，希望或能有多少貢獻。</p>
<p>起草本文時，承內地各機關多所指示，深為感謝，而對各地農民及民衆在此米糧問題空前嚴重中的奮鬥，衷心欽敬。</p>
<p>青黃不接期對策的意義</p>
<p>整個對策與青黃不接期對策，是二而一，一而二，絕不是二個分離的問題。青黃不接期的對策不能陳公公，則新米上市後的對策，也完全不可能。有些人對於米價問題很樂觀地說：</p>
<p>「現在時青黃不接期，米價的狂漲是難免的。新米一上市，米價將頓時下瀉。」</p>
<p>這種樂觀說是錯誤的。新米的價格，以陳米的價格為基礎而出發，這祗要看去年的例子也可以明白。去年在青黃不接期告終。而新米上市之前，米價曾跌落若干，但至上市最盛期，又逐漸上漲。所以青黃不接期的價格，同時也就是決定新米上市後米價的對策。又有人說：「青黃不接期的對策決定以後，再對新米樹立一般的對策好了。」可是在實踐上說，沒有這種踱方步式的餘裕了。記者在崑山、松江、蘇州、無錫四地，人家第一句便問：「南京及上海隊新米的對策決定了嗎？如其沒有決定，那麼什麽時候可以決定呢？」</p>
<p>當然，新聞記者不是施策當局，對此責問字不會有負責的答覆，當局或許已決定了這當的對策，而為記者所不知道的。內地的人們都一致認為青黃不接期的臨時措置係整個米糧對策中的一重要部門，而在最具體的形式上加以考察。對於此次上海為中心的措置以外所剩下來的重要對策，緊急實施的時期與方法，都刮目以待。實際上，走到內地去看，確立全面的米糧對策，實在不容再遲延一分一秒了。現在不是準備開始的時期，而應該是各種準備完成的時期。（翔：譯自六月二十日大陸新報主本特派員無錫通訊）</p>

<p>我們屢次說過，上海米價黑市的暴漲，人為的操縱是主要原因。若中不肖米商追求一已暴利，不顧大衆痛苦，高抬私拉，造成畸形局面，從中獲得寶利。他們旣獲暴利之後，遂盡情享受，烟賭狎妓，無所不為。從上面的事實裏，更足以證明若輩的行為。</p>
<p>前天經濟保安處長五島氏在市政諮詢會招得席上論：「奸商巨愁，追求暴利之輩，則絕不縱容，以掃除上海社會之毒洗。」對於道輩米商追求暴利得逞以後，於書寓中抽烟賭博，逍遙自在，目無法紀者，我們認為有嚴密審訊的必要，如果詢問後確有投機體據，尤應處以應得之罪。</p>
<p>社會正期待若輩的下落，盼望有關當局隨時將辦理情形公告，以為後來者炯戒。</p>

<h3>Starting from a Low Position: The Employment Problem of University Graduates</h3>
<p>After graduation exams are completed and graduation theses are written, most university students will leave school and enter society to serve. In China, where social undertakings are backward, finding a job is quite difficult. Before the war, everyone said "graduation equals unemployment," and this difficulty is even more pronounced now. However, do not be discouraged. Roads are made by walking, and opportunities must be found by oneself. They certainly won't fall from the sky. As long as you are determined to find them, you will eventually achieve your goal. Most importantly, you must not be too self-important.</p>
<p>In China, those who can receive a university education account for a very small percentage of the national population. University graduates are naturally worthy of respect and importance. However, you must not believe that the knowledge gained in university is sufficient for application in society. You must understand that what you learn in university is merely a method of studying academics and handling affairs. University graduates must use these methods to continue seeking knowledge. Only then will this knowledge be alive, and only then will this knowledge be needed by individuals and society. Therefore, the main task after graduating from university is to apply new methods to seek living knowledge. After leaving school, everyone in society is a teacher, and every event in society is a textbook. Therefore, during the study period, one learns in school, and during the employment period, one learns in society. As the saying goes, "One can never stop learning," and the psychology of learning never stops, so the success of a career is also endless.</p>
<p>If one approaches job seeking with a learning mentality, then a humble position and a small job are opportunities to learn. These are also the foundations of society, and they are even more worthy of attention for those who are new to society. Therefore, liberal arts graduates may as well do copying or proofreading, business graduates may as well be shop assistants or assistants, engineering graduates may as well be trainees or draftsmen, and education graduates may as well be elementary school teachers. Taking liberal arts as an example, those who have the ability to write articles and do editing work will not be lowering their status by doing proofreading or copying. On the contrary, one can increase learning opportunities and see the work of many advanced people through copying and proofreading. Moreover, starting from small matters and small positions allows one to step into an organization. Once one has stepped into this organization, one then has the opportunity to display one's abilities. The society currently needs real talents so urgently. If one has real abilities, society will never bury you, and you don't have to worry about being buried. This is true for liberal arts, and it is also true for graduates of other disciplines.</p>
<p>Approaching employment with a learning mentality means that the purpose is to learn. Therefore, as long as the nature of the occupation matches one's personality and matches the subjects one has studied, one should not worry about anything else first. One must not have thoughts about high or low positions, because "unable to achieve higher positions and unwilling to accept lower ones" is the biggest problem for university graduates seeking employment. One must not have thoughts about the ease or difficulty of work, because a leisurely job is the greatest obstacle to a young person's progress. Great careers are developed from a foundation of small, gradual steps, and great success can only be achieved through step-by-step, arduous struggles. There is no such thing as luck in the world, and no one is allowed to take shortcuts during this time of global war. Taking shortcuts may succeed for a while, but it can never be sustained permanently. Only those who are down-to-earth, continue to struggle, and constantly improve can create the greatest career and achieve the greatest success.</p>
<h3>Near the Mariana Islands: Heavy Damage to Enemy Forces by Japanese Air Force</h3>
<p>More than Twenty Enemy Ships of Various Types Sunk</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM on the 20th: The enemy forces that attacked Saipan Island, after seizing a corner of the island on the afternoon of June 15, have repeatedly increased their troop strength. The Japanese defense forces immediately launched a counterattack and inflicted heavy damage on them. The enemy that appeared near the Mariana Islands is a large mobile force mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships. The enemy has now concentrated most of its Pacific Fleet in that area. The Japanese air force is attacking the enemy mobile force every day. From June 12 to today, the confirmed results are as follows: A. Sunk 1 enemy battleship (general), 2 cruisers, 1 destroyer, and 1 submarine. B. Destroyed at least 4 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 4 cruisers, 8 transport ships, and 1 ship of unknown type. C. Shot down more than 300 enemy aircraft. Enemy ships and aircraft also suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - The US Navy Department announced at 7:20 PM on the 19th: Japanese and American forces engaged in an unprecedented air battle over the sea off Saipan Island on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Capture of Changsha and Liling; Japanese Troops in Henan Prepare for the Next Operation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th: Japanese troops operating in the Hunan area completely captured Changsha and Liling on the evening of the 18th and are continuing to mop up the remnants of the enemy in the vicinity. Since the start of operations against the Chongqing troops, the enemy forces that have been defeated total approximately 15 divisions. Japanese troops in the Henan area, in the western area of Shanxian County in the early part of this month, defeated the defeated and remnant troops of the Chongqing 11th War Zone and the 6 armies belonging to the 8th War Zone, causing them to flee towards Tongguan. Currently, the Japanese troops are preparing for the next operation.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha is now in the hands of the Japanese army for the third time. Changsha is strategically important, embracing Yue Mountain and overlooking the Xiang River. It is also equipped with a large artillery position with 40 large cannons of a certain type, making it a major fortress. However, under the attack of the brave and heroic Japanese army, it failed to function at all. The Japanese army launched a general attack to defeat Wang Deling's 4th Army and the 54th Police Division. Only three days later, at 3:30 PM on the 18th, they captured the most important strategic stronghold. The Japanese troops attacking Yue Mountain, before 7:00 AM on the 18th, used nighttime surprise tactics to approach the Chongqing army's position, where machine guns were firing wildly. They launched a fierce grenade battle, then broke into the Chongqing army's position and engaged in an extremely tragic bayonet battle. The Japanese artillery also heavily shelled the approximately two divisions of Chongqing troops in the city of Changsha. The Japanese troops attacking the city successively broke into the city from the south and southeast on the 17th. At noon on the 18th, they advanced to Zhongshan Road in the central city of Changsha and engaged in street fighting. The enemy troops retreated along the Xiang River to the important docks in the north. The Japanese army heavily shelled the enemy troops moving towards the Xiang River. Finally, at 3:30 PM, after occupying Mingde School and the docks near the corner of the city, they broke into the city from all four directions: southeast, northwest. They continued to mop up the remaining enemy troops in the city. Thus, Changsha, the military, political, and economic center in the 9th War Zone, has now fallen into the hands of the Japanese army for the third time.</p>
<p>Taking Double Encirclement - Annihilation Tactics</p>
<p>China Frontline Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha, the key point of the Chongqing army, was first captured in September of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941). The previous two Changsha offensives in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) were fundamentally different from this disaster in terms of strategy. In the previous two operations, the Japanese army only advanced from the east bank of Dongting Lake. This time, they advanced simultaneously from both sides of the lake, attacking the Chongqing 6th and 9th War Zones at the same time. One side encircled Changsha, and the other side used a powerful mobile force to attack deep into the core of the two war zones, directly attacking Liling, Liuyang, Xiangtan, and Ningxiang, which connect to the outskirts of Changsha for more than fifty kilometers, forming a large encirclement and taking double encirclement annihilation tactics. During the previous two operations, the defeated and remnant troops of the Chongqing army who luckily escaped returned to their original locations after the Japanese army withdrew on their own. At that time, they carried out large-scale false propaganda, as if they had seized the area with force. However, as a result of this Japanese operation, the Chongqing side also admitted that Changsha had fallen, and the losses of the field army were even greater. Not only were they unable to carry out false propaganda again, but they also faced a crisis in the war of resistance and requested rapid assistance from Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Deeply Affected in Military and Economic Terms</p>
<p>Hunan Japanese Army Frontline, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha is not only a military stronghold for the Chongqing side but also occupies an important position economically. Its transportation includes highways to Sichuan and railways from Xiangtan to Guizhou. Moreover, Zhuzhou, south of Changsha, is the intersection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Han railways. The waterway has the convenience of the Xiang River, which connects to Beiping in the north and Guizhou in the south. Highways and waterways are the economic arteries of Chongqing. Due to the Chongqing army's arbitrary requisitions and the darkness of politics, the rural areas of Hunan are extremely exhausted and still live in pain. However, it still serves as a supply station for the Chongqing army and undertakes important tasks. The production of Hunan's antimony mines accounts for 70% of the world's production. Other resources such as coal mines are also extremely rich, but most have not been exploited. Since Changsha occupies such importance in military and economic terms, the depth of the blow suffered by the Chongqing side when it is occupied by the Japanese army is self-evident. The anxiety of the United States is also not difficult to imagine. It is expected that the Chongqing side will also cite the example of the Henan operation and shift the cause of the defeat to the insufficient material assistance from the United States. The United States' dissatisfaction with the Chongqing side will inevitably increase as a result.</p>
<p>Remarks by a Staff Officer of the Expeditionary Force</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force occupied Changsha in just two weeks since the start of the South China operation. After learning of the Japanese army's victory, a certain staff officer of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force especially met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing on the 20th and made the following remarks: Since the Japanese Expeditionary Force began operations against Changsha, it has completely occupied Changsha in just two weeks. During the first and second Changsha operations, after the Japanese army occupied Changsha, when the Japanese army automatically retreated, the Chongqing side forcibly attached itself and publicized to the outside world that the Japanese army had been defeated, implementing their false propaganda techniques. Now, part of the city of Changsha has returned to the hands of the Japanese army, and the Japanese flag is flying again on Yue Mountain. At this time, the Chongqing army may be spreading rumors that Changsha is still holding out, which is really not worth a knowing smile. It has long been known to us that the Chongqing army's combat power is low and it is no match for the Japanese army. The only people who are deceived are the people under the rule of Chongqing and some people in Britain and the United States. The Japanese Expeditionary Force has never attached importance to the occupation of a city. The main goal is to inflict a great blow on the Chongqing field army. Every past operation has had this as its goal. As a result, the Chongqing army's combat power has been declining day by day. The defeat of the Chongqing army in the current Henan campaign and the capture of Changsha is enough to prove its inability to do anything. Britain and the United States were previously dazzled by Chongqing's false words and overconfident in Chongqing's combat power, believing that it would be enough to compete with the Japanese army if they were supplied with excellent equipment. However, recent events will eventually force Britain and the United States to reflect. Moreover, in this operation, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has changed its past ineffectiveness, merely making propaganda without taking action, which is beyond our expectations. No matter how much the British and American air forces stationed in Chongqing increase or improve their quality, they are only bait for the Japanese army. This can be clearly seen in the recent Japanese military results. In the future, even if Britain and the United States continue to lend modern military equipment to the Chongqing army, it will ultimately be like a drop in the bucket for Chongqing, which is on the verge of collapse, and will be of no help. The Japanese Expeditionary Force will inflict a painful blow on the Chongqing army and turn the plans of Britain and the United States into a bubble.</p>
<p>Naval Cooperation in the Course of Operations</p>
<p>Published by the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet Stationed in China (4:00 PM, June 20): The Japanese naval forces stationed in China have maintained close contact with the army since the start of the Hunan operation, and they are actively progressing in the operation to defeat the enemy. The following is a summary of the cooperation with the army since the fall of YingTian, a key point in the Ninth War Zone:</p>
<p>Powerful troops formed in late May advanced to a certain base together with the army, taking the lead as pioneers. More than twenty exposed machine gun positions under the Leishi Mountain in Yuezhou were originally set up for defense. After our army took great risks and successfully eliminated them, they continued to advance under the Leishi Mountain. When sailing up the Yushui River, they engaged with enemy planes that launched fierce attacks from the Gaoshan area, repelling them. Under enemy bombing, they bravely cooperated with the army, sailing up the Pingjiang River near the river and capturing defeated enemies, thoroughly annihilating them.</p>
<p>Moreover, when our army advanced near the upper reaches of the Herbaceous Lake, twelve anxious enemy P40-type aircraft attacked again. After our army responded bravely, they suddenly fled.</p>
<p>In early June, operations began towards Xinshi in the Xiang River. They stepped forward to cross the river and attacked near YingTian. Certain troops were able to land successfully. The Chongqing army, which had been entrenched near YingTian in advance, attempted to prevent our army's advance, laying many minefields in the river and launching fierce counterattacks. After our brave pursuit and operations, they continued to carry out mine sweeping operations near Xiaopiaonao. The Chongqing army's artillery fire from the Qiqingshan area was silenced, and YingTian was captured on the morning of June 6. The Chongqing army was shocked when they learned that YingTian had fallen, and enemy aircraft responded by attacking our army. In particular, sixteen enemy P40-type aircraft attacked the waterway from YingTian to Chugongmiao. Our mine sweeping troops repeatedly encountered danger, but after our fierce artillery fire, they were finally driven back. According to the established operations, they dealt with the complete defense wood sheds and mines in YingTian, then attacked Xiangyin, gaining victories step by step.</p>
<p>Since the Yangtze River sailing operations in Showa 12 (1937), our mine sweeping troops have been skilled in operations, and the adoption of new weapons has been extremely ingenious, eliminating many obstacles. At that time, the stubborn enemies on both cliffs and the attacking enemy aircraft were the elite US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, so it was very difficult. The morale of the team members became more and more vigorous, and they closely cooperated with the army, achieving practical results, unfolding a beautiful scene of land-sea coordination everywhere. In the meantime, more than four hundred and fifty mines were disposed of, and the number of defense wood sheds disposed of reached more than two hundred and sixty. Our losses were extremely minor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Achieve Great Results in the Nujiang and Myitkyina Areas; Securing the Northern Burma Line of Defense with a Small Force Against a Large One</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in the Nujiang and Myitkyina areas have achieved great results with a small force against a large one. In late April, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force on the Nujiang front, echoing the offensive in the Fugong area, attempted to capture the Nujiang from the south, linking Tengchong, Longling, and Pingga lines. After a full-scale counterattack by the Japanese army, the enemy troops north of Tengchong retreated from the Gaoligong Mountains and suffered a fatal blow on the banks of the Nujiang River. The Japanese army then attacked the enemy troops south of Longling. The enemy troops crossed the Nujiang River and advanced westward, making contact with the airborne troops that landed near Myitkyina, creating a situation of attacking the Japanese troops north of Myitkyina from both sides. However, due to the Japanese army's assault, this ultimately failed. In addition, the area entered the rainy season, making it difficult for the Nujiang enemy troops to transport supplies, and they were trapped in a dilemma. Since the start of the Nujiang operation, as of June 11, the confirmed losses of the enemy troops totaled 5,416 dead and wounded, 74 captured, and the loss of 24 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, and 79 light machine guns. The Japanese side had 321 killed in action. Near Myitkyina, on May 17, the Japanese army counterattacked the new airborne troops and ground infiltration troops in the area, securing the position and crushing the enemy's attempt to attack the northern Burma line of defense. Before June 12, the enemy air force had 2,200 soldiers killed in action around Myitkyina alone.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch from United Press, the Chongqing military authorities announced that the Chongqing army had withdrawn from Longling.</p>
<p>Nujiang Frontline, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops on the Nujiang front are still in an active position in attacking the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force. The Japanese army is also pursuing the defeated Chongqing troops in the rain and launching a fierce mopping-up operation. On the 16th, they killed more than 100 Chongqing soldiers in the Longling area, and the rest fled. In addition, they surrounded and bombarded the Chongqing troops north of the area, killing more than 120 of their cavalry, capturing 2 heavy mortars, 2 machine guns, and a lot of other ammunition. The Chongqing troops in the Maguan area were painfully attacked by the Japanese army on the 14th and 15th and fled in embarrassment. Therefore, since the start of the Nujiang operation, the Chongqing army has indeed abandoned corpses totaling 5,500.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Grain Problems in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The reporter traveled through Kunshan, Songjiang, and Suzhou to Wuxi, and generally intends to investigate and study the following two points.</p>
<p>What kind of general grain fundamental countermeasure is suitable for the actual situation in the inland?</p>
<p>What kind of emergency grain countermeasure during the period of grain shortage does the reality in the inland need?</p>
<p>The above two points are actually an inseparable issue. A specific general grain fundamental countermeasure must be an emergency countermeasure during the period of grain shortage. And from appropriate countermeasures during the period of grain shortage, the entire grain year's general grain countermeasure is developing. However, the reporter deeply feels the severity of the situation during the period of grain shortage in Shanghai and the inland, so he cannot but pay special attention to the emergency countermeasure during the period of grain shortage.</p>
<p>The reporter has always agreed with the fundamental policy of purchasing grain, and it is the principle advocated by the reporter. And it is indeed worth noting that this is not just empty talk on paper in Shanghai. Twenty is adapted to the actual situation in the inland, so it is extremely gratifying. However, on the one hand, I am happy, and on the other hand, I am worried. Because how to deal with the problem during the period of grain shortage has not yet reached a clear conclusion. The reporter intends to continue visiting various places, and if possible, hopes to obtain the focus of the most effective countermeasures during the period of grain shortage. The travel notes of visiting various grain distribution centers published here are only reports on the actual situation in the inland regarding the following issues, and principle reviews.</p>
<p>1. What is the significance of countermeasures during the period of grain shortage?</p>
<p>2. What is the main reason for purchasing hardships?</p>
<p>3. Have movement restrictions been eased?</p>
<p>4. Is the so-called administrative purchase yes or no?</p>
<p>5. How should the Rice Control Association and its subordinate institutions be reformed?</p>
<p>6. What is the truth about grain hoarding and how should it be dealt with?</p>
<p>Regarding the above six questions, the reporter's report and review do not have the feeling of talking about medicine by the patient's pillow. But now that people are focused on the future of the grain problem, the reporter's abstract report hopes to make some contribution to correctly understanding this problem.</p>
<p>When drafting this article, I am deeply grateful for the instructions given by various agencies in the inland, and I sincerely admire the struggles of farmers and the people in various places in this unprecedentedly serious grain problem.</p>
<p>The Significance of Countermeasures during the Period of Grain Shortage</p>
<p>The entire countermeasure and the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage are two and one, and one and two. They are by no means two separate issues. If the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage cannot be put into practice, then the countermeasure after the new rice is on the market is also completely impossible. Some people say optimistically about the rice price problem:</p>
<p>"Now is the period of grain shortage, and the soaring rice price is inevitable. Once the new rice is on the market, the rice price will suddenly plummet."</p>
<p>This optimism is wrong. The price of new rice is based on the price of old rice, and this can be understood by looking at last year's example. Last year, the period of grain shortage ended. Before the new rice was on the market, the rice price had fallen slightly, but it gradually rose again during the peak period of the market. Therefore, the price during the period of grain shortage is also the countermeasure that determines the price of rice after the new rice is on the market. Some people also say: "After the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage is determined, then establish a general countermeasure for the new rice." But in practice, there is no such leisurely pace. When the reporter was in Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, and Wuxi, people asked in the first sentence: "Has Nanjing and Shanghai decided on a countermeasure for the new rice? If it hasn't been decided, then when can it be decided?"</p>
<p>Of course, a news reporter is not a policy-making authority, and will not have a responsible answer to this question. The authorities may have already decided on this appropriate countermeasure, which is unknown to the reporter. People in the inland all agree that temporary measures during the period of grain shortage are an important part of the entire grain countermeasure, and they are examining it in the most concrete form. People are waiting with bated breath for the important countermeasures remaining after the measures centered on Shanghai, and the timing and methods of their emergency implementation. In fact, going to the inland to see, establishing a comprehensive grain countermeasure, cannot be delayed for even a minute or a second. Now is not the time to prepare to start, but the time when all preparations should be completed. (Xiang: Translated from the Wuxi correspondent of the mainland Xinbao Special Envoy, June 20)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Operating South of Lingbao in the Scorching Heat; Xin'an Maintenance Society Striving to Increase Production</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since the 5th, the remnants of the defeated Qian troops of the First War Zone, and sixteen divisions of the Eighth War Zone troops that came from the west to rescue them, have been completely annihilated by the Japanese troops south of Lingbao. Afterwards, the elite troops of the Japanese army, in cooperation with tank units, braved the dangerous terrain and scorching heat to launch annihilation battles everywhere. The mopping-up operation is still continuing. On the 8th, Japanese troops, echoing the tank units, fiercely attacked the 57th Army under Ding Dechan of the Eighth War Zone troops, defeating them. Also, since the 9th, Japanese troops pursuing the defeated and remnant troops attacked and defeated the retreating troops of the First War Zone south of Lingbao on the 10th. Japanese troops advancing from the north and south to the west of Lingbao further annihilated the enemy's powerful defeated and remnant troops in the southern region of the area, crushing the enemy's intentions. At the same time, they inflicted a major blow on the Eighth War Zone troops. Since then, Hu Zongnan's army will be directly attacked by the Japanese army, and will inevitably feel a major threat.</p>
<p>Luoyang, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese troops entered Xin'an County, they established public security maintenance associations in various villages and towns. It is reported that they have combined them into one to form the Xin'an County Public Security Maintenance Association, and the establishment ceremony will be held on the 22nd. Under a unified organization, the maintenance association will actively engage in increasing the production of special products such as iron, coal, sulfur, timber, cotton, and corn.</p>

<h3>Owner of Aijuge Pavilion Donates Paintings for Charity Exhibition: 70% Sold on the First Day</h3>
<p>Mr. Liang Zhongyi, owner of the Aijuge Pavilion, has donated 250 pieces of famous calligraphy and paintings from the Qing Dynasty for a charity sale to support education. The calligraphy and paintings were displayed at the China Book Garden on Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday was the first day of the public exhibition. Mr. Liang personally attended to provide guidance.

<h3>Beifeng Park Renamed Zhongshan Park</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the First District Office believes that the construction of parks within its jurisdiction is of great importance to the legitimate recreation and health of citizens. Therefore, it spares no effort in organizing and managing them. A park division has been specifically established to handle these matters. In addition to planning to use vacant land owned by the office to open small parks, close attention is also paid to the management of existing parks. All park names and management personnel have been appropriately adjusted. Zhaomeng Park, the largest park in the city, has now been renamed Zhongshan Park so that visitors can always develop respect for the Father of the Nation, thus instilling education in recreation, which is an excellent approach.</p>
<p>Although the sale of food and drinks in various parks is contracted out to merchants, the prices are set by the office, which are lower than those outside, with the aim of benefiting tourists. The office sends personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time to prevent contractors from disobeying and exceeding the price limits.</p>
<p>From time to time, tourists bring badminton rackets and other equipment into the parks to play, causing the green lawns to be trampled and damaged, destroying the park's appearance and hindering public welfare. The Public Works Department has, in view of this, ordered park managers to strictly prohibit this. The bare grasslands have also been re-laid, giving them a fresh new look. Regulations have been established at the entrances and exits to remind visitors to pay attention. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate at any time, cherish flowers and trees, maintain cleanliness, develop self-governance, and abide by public morals. It is reported that the Public Works Department is planning to enrich the facilities within various parks that benefit the physical and mental health of citizens. The department welcomes any opinions from citizens. Please send them to the opinions box at the Public Works Department entrance at 192 Hankou Road.</p>
<h3>New Cheng District Baojia Committee Established Today</h3>

At that time, the Director of the Baojia Office will personally attend the meeting to guide, supervise the oath taking, and deliver a speech.</p>
<h3>Electricity Supply to North Jiangxi Road Suspended for Violating Blackout Regulations</h3>
<p>The authorities in this city are implementing air defense measures to ensure the lives and property of citizens. Therefore, blackout regulations are particularly strict. However, residents along North Jiangxi Road, Dexing Lane, and Guangxing Lane often do not cover their windows with black cloth, and do not add black shades to their electric lights, causing light to leak outwards, which violates the air defense regulations. Several warnings were given to residents with light leaks by air defense personnel in the area after alerts were issued at night. However, some residents still had light leaks, which was unacceptable. The Hongkou Police Bureau learned of this and, on the 19th, sent police officers accompanied by power company workers to suspend the electricity supply to the aforementioned residents as a punishment. After this incident occurred, the Baozhang of the area immediately and diligently advised residents to cover their windows with black cloth and cover their electric lights with black shades to ensure that no light leaked out. It is reported that all residents have taken action, so the Baozhang is preparing to submit a request to the competent branch bureau to restore the electricity supply.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Town Distributes Coal Briquettes, Matches, and Soap</h3>
<p>The third period household coal briquettes and the first period household soap and matches in Zhabei Town began distribution yesterday (20th) and will end on the 29th of this month. Citizens can purchase ten jin of coal briquettes, one bar of soap, and one small box of matches from designated retailers with their certificates. As for the second period household soap and third period household coal briquettes and matches in Nanshi, the deadline was originally the 17th. It has now been extended to tomorrow (22nd).</p>
<h3>Opium Smoking Prohibited in Brothels</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau of this city is determined to eradicate smoking and gambling in order to clean up the city. It has ordered all branches to investigate and crack down on these activities. The Lao Zha Branch recently received reports that some brothels were allowing guests to gamble and smoke opium. The branch had already ordered a crackdown, but these individuals were still disobeying in secret. Therefore, the branch chief, Mao Dehui, ordered the head of the administrative section, etc., to conduct investigations at various locations. In the Huile Lane, Ying, Wanqiu, Ruying, Meiying, and other brothels, they seized opium lamps, opium pipes, gambling paraphernalia, etc. A large number of rice merchants were also caught smoking and gambling. All were taken to the bureau for questioning and handed over to the judicial department for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>Urges Citizens to Report Malfeasance in Coal Briquette Distribution</h3>
<p>Recently, when citizens use their No. 5 allocation coal briquette coupons to purchase household coal briquettes, it has been discovered that inferior coal briquettes are being used for allocation, or that water has been added, or that coal chunks are not delivered and are replaced with three jin of coal briquettes, which is extremely deplorable. The authorities have repeatedly instructed the Coal Briquette Manufacturers' Association to instruct its members to strictly manufacture coal briquettes according to the specified composition. If there is any disobedience, once evidence is found, it will be severely investigated and punished. On the other hand, all coal briquette retailers have been notified not to engage in malfeasance. It is hoped that citizens will report such situations to the nearby police station at any time, or send a letter to the Economic Security Office on Avenue Edward VII. They will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Smoking and Gambling in Brothels</h3>
<p>According to today's newspaper report, the Lao Zha Branch of the First Police Bureau sent personnel to seize opium paraphernalia and gambling paraphernalia in a brothel in Huile Lane, and a large number of rice merchants were caught smoking and gambling. They were all taken to the bureau for questioning and handed over to the judicial department for investigation according to law.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly said that the sharp rise in rice prices on the black market in Shanghai is mainly due to artificial manipulation. Some unscrupulous rice merchants seek exorbitant profits for themselves, disregarding the suffering of the public, raising prices privately, and creating an abnormal situation, from which they obtain great wealth. After obtaining exorbitant profits, they indulge in enjoyment, smoking, gambling, and prostitution. The facts above further prove the behavior of these individuals.</p>
<p>The Economic Security Director, Mr. Goshima, said at the Municipal Advisory Meeting the day before yesterday: "Those unscrupulous merchants who seek exorbitant profits will never be tolerated in order to sweep away the scourge of Shanghai society." For these rice merchants who seek exorbitant profits and then smoke and gamble in brothels, living carefree and disregarding the law, we believe that a thorough interrogation is necessary. If, after the interrogation, there is concrete evidence of speculation, they should be punished accordingly.</p>
<p>Society is waiting for the fate of these individuals and hopes that the relevant authorities will announce the handling of the situation at any time as a warning to those who come after.</p>

Less than ten minutes later, Hualian had a corner kick opportunity, and Dai Linjing scored in the chaos. The good times did not last long. Su Ruo passed to Fu En, and Liu Zhihan carelessly lost the goal, losing another goal. The Portuguese merchants' offensive was strong. Unfortunately, Li Ning was eager to save the ball and committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick, which was kicked in by Oliveira. The Hualian players became fierce and Han Longhai passed cleverly to A Dai, who scored. The Portuguese merchants led 3-2 in the first half.</p>
<h3>Charity Ball Auction</h3>
<p>In the middle, there was a charity ball auction, which was hosted by the movie stars Zhuan Langen and Gu Xiucen Guan Hongda. As a result, Zhu Wenyao made a big splash and bought the ball for 200,000 yuan. Mrs. Wu Songquan presented the award. During the second half, the Portuguese merchants were still very rampant.
