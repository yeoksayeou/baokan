<p>社評</p>
<h3>輿論的活用</h3>
<p>一般從政者往往有一種見解，認爲在戰爭時期或時局嚴重關頭，是必須實施嚴恪的輿論抑制政策。然而實行這種抑制輿論政策的結果如何？中外各國，史實昭然，所謂「防民之口，甚於防川」，徧激横溢，聚蚊成雷，往往反而使時局更加嚴重。所以最成功的政治家，越是到了緊急時期，越是知道輿論的活用，一方面通過輿論機關，使民衆澈底明瞭時局的眞和，使大家有所準備而不至爲敵方的謀略所動搖；另一方面，更可通過輿論機關，使當局充分明瞭人心趨向，俾可集中意志，集中力量。消極的可以避免流言蜚語，積極的可以集思廣益克服困難完遂國策。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的決戰，將決定日木和柬亞全民族的命運，敵人在今臼不僅企圖以飛機戰艦在物質上反攻，並且用謀略紙彈和電波來作精神上的反攻。可是，在這決戰階段，日本新內閣所採取的方策，卻不是加强言論檢查統制的辦法，而是「尊重言論」政策！新任悄報局緒方總裁本人就是民間奧論權威，已經充分表現日木當局尊重言論的重大決心。而緒方總裁八月九日在翼政會情報部理事會上的致詞，更公開宜示日本當局決心改革言論對策，排除取締的態度，對於公正的批判等等，不加任何牽制；對於輿論指導，則將置重點於報章方面，貫澈尊重言論政策，特別對於非常事態發生時，當力求新聞報道之活潑化－迅速正確。爲了施行這種政策，將盡力活用民問人村，以期充分發揮宣傳實效</p>
<p>我們從盟邦日本悄報宣傳工作的新方針，可以充分看出共特點，就在迅速澈底的尊重國民輿論，以便加强人民對政治及軍事的信賴，使戰局之現實與國民心理兩者之間沒有絲毫間隙，以便把握人心集中民力，從思想戰方面輔翼大政黨完遂戰爭。我們在這裹除了敬佩盟邦當局這種賢明新方針之外，對於參戰將及二年的我國情報宜傳政策，以及在此決戰階段的我國輿論界，不能不發生自顧惶愧的感覺，希望在最短時間也有同樣賢明措置。政府對於奧論指導，除置重點於報章以外，同時，政府各級當局應與民間領袖保持密切接觸，如經常舉行時局座談會等，對於時局動態，政府施策，使民間均有深刻瞭解，毫無隔閡。</p>
<h3>輿論的活用　緒方總裁披瀝懷抱</h3>
<p>日本翼政會於八月九日下午三時在本部舉行情報部理事會，請緒方情報局總裁出席。緒方總裁就悄報宣傳政策所抱之見解，加以詮釋稱：「改革以前對言論取締的態度，不牽制公正的批判，但在輿論指導上特別以新聞爲重心。對新聞之內容，不予干涉。如壓戰空氣等的發生，實因新聞不記載眞正的事實。希望迅即貫澈尊重言論的方針。空襲等非常事態發生時，新聞的報道應更活潑，同時，知事及警察署長應提供正確的材料，以防止流言於朱然。又情報局實施宣傳啓發時，應努力活用民間人士。」</p>
<p>繼由翼政會情報部提出下述强化悄報宣部政策，緒方總裁對此表示贊同，並確允沿此方向努力，使國民强化對軍事及政治的信賴，使戰局的現實與國民的思想之間無隙可乘，以謀情報宣傳政策的澈底刷新。</p>
<p>勿使國民耽於安全，政府應讓國民獲悉時局的眞相，處任何環境，亦活不動搖。</p>
<p>富指導言論時，勿加無理的拘東，把握國民的心理，且勿使坐失時機。尤以在新聞方面，打破現在的消極統制方針，各報有各報的特色，編撰淸新潑刺的內容，使發揚國民的感情。</p>
<p>各省分屬的情報宣傳機關，統合於情報局，使負責强化統一的任務。</p>
<p>鑒於思想戰爲戰爭最後的決定條件，故應使情報局有「思想戰」本部的性格。</p>
<p>關於國民發表政治的意見，應與翼贊政治會的活動同樣措置。（翔：譯自八月十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日泰首外相聲明決　加强友好關係　相互協力爭取共同勝利</h3>

<h3>緬境戰况</h3>
<p>東京廿八日中央社電　緬境渝軍爲打開來多公路，在敵美督戰下，反復攻擊怒江戰綫之日軍陣地，日守備部隊邀擊佔有優勢之渝軍攻勢，盡量克服兵數不足之困苦，僅以手溜彈戰或白刃戰重創渝軍，死守各地要衝。拉孟正面之渝軍，於十八·十九·二十日之三日間，曾猛烈轟擊日軍陣地，二十日晟仍展開全面攻勢，與日軍守備隊展開繳烈之白刃戰，目下仍在血戰中。騰越正面之渝軍，十六日因遭日軍反攻，損失極大，然於十八日晟，重整殘兵，再度向日軍猛攻，與日守備隊激戰二盡夜，於十九日之一瞬間，即全被擊退。二十日渝軍復在三度砲擊掩護下，擊破城壁一部，渝軍欲突入城內，當爲日軍擊退，十八日渝四度反復進攻，並在飛機十餘架及集中砲火掩護下，企圖由城壁之突破處侵入城內，日軍不分晝夜，惡戰苦鬥，仍鼓足勇氣，以寡兵邀擊渝軍，繼續展開血戰，自十三日至二十日，於騰越政防戰中，所獲綜合戰果，計渝軍棄屍至少爲八百具，日軍亦陣亡約百名，龍陵方面，渝單十八日黎明，以三千餘發之砲彈猛擊日軍陣地，並大舉突擊，與日軍展開壯烈之手潤彈及白刃戰，約一小時許始被擊退，十九日晟渝軍再度進攻，至二十一日復向日軍陣地猛繫約三小時，卒突入龍陵北方高地之日軍陣地，刻正與日軍守備隊激戰中。</p>
<h3>特魯克日　英勇作戰</h3>
<p>特魯克基地二十九日中央社電　自塞班島，大宮島及迭尼安島至特魯克島，乘飛機不過爲四小時之行程，特魯克島日守軍士氣軒昻，每當敵機來襲，英勇之日戰鬥機員，富即騰空迎戰，邀擊敵機，一方或從事潛艇之活嚴，襲擊敵艦，或於熾烈之空襲下，加緊實施陸戰訓練，構築陣地，血汗與泥土之結合，充分表現日前錢將士之苦幹精神。最近敵機來襲甚熾，時或數十架，時或數架，日空軍亦常以同量之飛機及驚駛員昇空邀擊，以决鬥精神補物量之不足，此種超人之行動，敵人亦常驚駭。所有陸上之陣地，對敵機空襲早有萬全防備，刻正築防空壕，即五百公斤之炸彈，亦不能炸毀，其他擴張陣地之工作，依然日夜繼續進行。一方爲防備敵軍之登陸，乃猛烈從事陸戰訓練，或於炎熱下，或於兩天中，訓練無間斷，同時爲防備補給路被敵遮斷，樹立自給食糧對策，開荒地，且已種植薯類南瓜及胡瓜等，成續極爲良好，如是萬全防備熊勢，即吿完成。</p>

<h3>日靑年勤勞運動　現達最高點　工塲服務努力增產</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日本靑年學生爲爭取捐戰勝利，創造新歷史，特倡導勤勞運動，目下此項運動愈益擴大，已達最高點。日海軍報道班文學挺身隊員海員十三，於參觀學生參加工塲勤勞工作後，發表感想如次：學生一詞，是包括大學以及中等學校的學生而言，現在日本各級學校，大多數已停課，全體學生都跑到工塲參加工作。但在本月中，每星期到學校受課一次，自下月份起，或將變更辦法，爲使學生專心學習各種技術，將完全改爲造船所的最精銳兵器。所以我想，執此類兵器者，當然是造船所的老工人，新參加的學生，不過站在遠處瞭望而已。殊知漸次跑進工塲內部，最使我吃驚並且出我意料之外的，是那些管理起重機或手持鐵鍾的，都是正在讀書的靑年學生。我看了這種情形，幾乎對我自己的眼睛發生疑問。你看，那邊一羣忙着轉動起重機者，不要嚮導者介紹，我就知道是靑年報國學生，敲帽釘的　洞的，無一個是門裏出身的工人。我也曾參觀過一次正在建造中的數萬噸大貨船，船底那邊也有一羣學生，在忙着釘帽釘，他們一面受着如火的暴日照灼，一面受着鎔鐵爐的煤火烘炙，裏裏外外，到處熱得大喘。但是他們仍然繼續努力，完成他們的使命。那邊一羣年靑的中學生集成一團，拼命搬運鋼鐵板，這邊有一隊正在熱情地製造滾軸。看爐的本來必須有一人是熟練工人，但是他們之中，學理工系的同學一個也沒有，全部都是文法系的學生。雖然是工塲的工作，因爲靑年學生們的頭腦淸晰，他們用普通人四分之一的時間，即可完成任務。他們的好處，尙不止此，因爲他們秉着眞的熱情，在工塲裏工作，尤其顯示着新鮮活潑的現象。雖然他們是整天勤勞，但無形中對於工塲的經營，工塲的管理法，漸次得到實地經騐。所以現在我們可以更進一步的下個結論，就是學生們完全不進學校，也沒有什麽値得做然於心的地方，靑年同學們是這樣自發的在爲國努力着。</p>

<p>日軍前綫基地二十九日中央社電　日機隊曾於二十八日夜進攻淪軍反攻據點柳州，炸毀其大型機一架，焚毀其地上機六架，並予陸上設施以相當損杏，日機全部安返原防。該次進攻雖可利用月光，但雲幕重重，航行頗感困難，日轟炸機隊約十時許抵達目標上空，首先判明於滑行路上停有淪機，立即投彈，將其焚毀，綱之以波狀攻擊，確實判明焚毀渝大型機六架，炸毀大刑機一架，並炸毀其地上設施多處。</p>
<h3>渝美軍注視　日次期作戰</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　衡陽陷落後，日軍動向頗為渝美軍所注目，且對日軍臆測極多，不論渝方美方，均確認日軍次期作戰，必將沿湘桂戰路突人廣西桂林·柳州，一方而南下打通粵漢綫，渝美軍在日軍威脅下，各有不同之念，是故各作策謀。渝軍事發言人會見記者曾謂，日軍目下向湘江西岸地方集中，其目的第一在攻導衡陽西方之渝軍，同時準備沿湘桂鐵路向廣西省城桂林進攻之，更預測次期作戰前，必將展開大殲減戰，謂美軍之中國海岸登陸計劃，幷不因日軍之湖南作戰而受挫折，美軍倘能登記，則渝軍亦能向沿岸地域進攻之。渝方爲遮掩國民耳目，大事誇大目下衡陽週　之激烈反攻及進攻宜昌週邊日軍之情形，淪方此　穴傳目的，在恢复美國報紙之認識，藉以增加對渝援助，推動尼米美國早已料及渝方內幕，故路透社等及美國各報，曾作如次論稱：渝軍此次在宜昌·漢口西方之軍事行動，自的在牽制湘南日軍進攻桂林，然宜昌·漢口已成鞏固之要塞，淪軍缺乏戰車，重火器之軍隊，故其作戰，難於成功云云。再據前綫消息，增援衡陽之渝軍約十師，蝟集於湘江東西兩岸，在永豐·金蘭布陣，然隨地遭日軍攻擊，風陵·安仁·耒陽方面淪軍之』反攻，亦遭日軍之挫折，渝單之反攻宜昌，僅爲宜傳，無甚富力，在日軍次期作戰威脅下，渝美軍頗爲膽寒。美國組約寨晤士報謂：倘日軍開始進攻桂林·柳州，則美空軍將不得不退避於　南矣，作悲觀之論，　牲渝車於大陸呼應太平津之反攻計訓，使美國益爲焦躁憂慮。</p>
<h3>喀爾巴阡東麓　激戰方酣　羅境蘇軍佔領布曹</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國社訊：蘇軍昨日以優勢兵力，由普魯特河下游南進，佔領普洛業什特（Ploeti　即羅境油區）東北四十五哩之布曹（Buxau），德軍仍於該河下游兩側進行劇烈攻防戰。喀爾巴阡山東部之激戰，已於洪牙利邊境展開，德洪聯軍奮力抗敵，敵軍死傷甚衆。維斯翥拉河套中巴拉謹夫以西，曾發生屢有進出之戰事。莫當及杜爾巴特（愛沙尼亞境）之西北，蘇軍發動新攻勢，德軍於反攻時，將數處之蘇軍擊退。</p>
<p>匈京二十九日中央社電　現羅馬尼亞戰綫之蘇軍，總兵力有六十至七十師團，正沿黑海岸南下，向普洛業什特及布加勒斯特進攻之蘇軍，其進展頗連。德軍在基什紐方面，一時被蘇羅軍包圍，但德軍脫出作戰成功，已向加拉茲方面集中，儘先以主力扼守多璃河下游及喀爾巴阡山脈之隘口。關於蘇軍意圖觀測不一，大概將以全軍南下，直逼喀爾巴阡山麓，以圖佔領羅馬尼亞後，威脅保加利亞</p>
<h3>東南歐　動態堪注目</h3>
<p>倘有必要分兵一部進攻保境而孤立希臘方面之德軍，再以一部進人塞爾維亞，與蒂托軍聯絡，以自南面進攻洪牙利。另一部增强克拉加庸遠征軍，以進攻德工業地帶修來堅及斯洛伐克等地。今後一兩週內，實南歐之動熊將益堪注目。此種情勢展開時，亞得里亞海及土耳其方面之新事態，亦頗須警戒。</p>

<h3>經濟保安處檢舉　米糧非法運銷　米統會職員逃避徵購查獲</h3>
<p>經濟保安處成立以來，對於取締本市囤積主要商品，擅自拾高市價，及經營配合物品舞弊等，不遺餘力，尤其對於食米之搬運及銷售一項，特別重視，先後已查獲逃避米糧徵購案件多件，而其被始舉案件中，有米統會職員串同米商，非法申請米糧搬運證明單，化整爲零，逃避徵購，該項行爲不獨有礙統制米糧政策，且直接影響民食，爲害非淺，故於調查確實已先後解送地方檢察署，依法究辦。茲將該二案之經過情形，略記於后：</p>
<p>米統會職員李守六，在米統會任事外，與親戚數人，在松江食設裕豐米號，而李守六利用職務上之便利，非法領得米糧搬運證明　十四張，第一次四張，第二次十張，將米糧化整為零，運滬銷售營利，李守六及其他合資者李夢　·李傳聲，經傳至本處查悉，確有賣職行爲，故已一併解送地方檢察署法辦。</p>

<h3>The Utilization of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Generally, politicians tend to hold the view that in times of war or severe crises, it is necessary to implement strict policies to suppress public opinion. However, what are the consequences of implementing such policies? The historical facts of China and foreign countries clearly show that "preventing the people's speech is more dangerous than preventing a river." Suppressed emotions overflow, small grievances become large, often making the situation even more serious. Therefore, the most successful politicians, especially in times of emergency, understand the importance of utilizing public opinion. On the one hand, they use media outlets to ensure that the public fully understands the true nature of the situation, preparing them and preventing them from being swayed by enemy strategies. On the other hand, they leverage the media to ensure that the authorities fully understand the people's sentiments, enabling them to concentrate their will and power. Negatively, this can avoid rumors and slanders; positively, it can gather collective wisdom, overcome difficulties, and complete national policies.</p>
<p>The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War will determine the fate of Japan and all the nations of East Asia. Today, the enemy not only attempts to counterattack materially with planes and warships but also launches spiritual counterattacks using strategic paper bullets and radio waves. However, in this decisive stage, the policy adopted by the new Japanese cabinet is not to strengthen censorship and control of speech, but rather a "respect for speech" policy! The new head of the Information Bureau, Mr. Ogata, himself a civilian authority on public opinion, has fully demonstrated the Japanese authorities' significant determination to respect speech. Furthermore, Mr. Ogata's address to the Board of Directors of the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on August 9th publicly declared the Japanese authorities' determination to reform speech countermeasures, eliminating the attitude of suppression. For fair criticism, no restrictions will be imposed. For public opinion guidance, the emphasis will be placed on newspapers, thoroughly implementing a policy of respecting speech, especially in the event of an emergency, striving to make news reports more vibrant – swift and accurate. To implement this policy, efforts will be made to fully utilize civilian talent in order to fully exert the effectiveness of propaganda.</p>
<p>From the new guidelines of our ally Japan's information and propaganda work, we can fully see its special feature: the rapid and thorough respect for national public opinion, in order to strengthen the people's trust in politics and the military, so that there is no gap between the reality of the war situation and the national psychology, in order to grasp the people's hearts and concentrate the people's strength, and to support the major political parties in completing the war from the perspective of ideological warfare. In addition to admiring the wise new policy of our allied authorities, we cannot help but feel a sense of self-consciousness and shame regarding our own country's information and propaganda policy, which has been involved in the war for nearly two years, and our country's public opinion circles in this decisive stage. We hope that similar wise measures will be taken in the shortest time possible. In addition to placing emphasis on newspapers for public opinion guidance, government authorities at all levels should also maintain close contact with civilian leaders, such as holding regular symposiums on the current situation, so that civilians have a deep understanding of the current situation and government policies, with no separation.</p>
<h3>The Utilization of Public Opinion: Director Ogata Reveals His Aspirations</h3>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Information Department at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on August 9th, inviting Information Bureau Director Ogata to attend. Director Ogata explained his views on information and propaganda policy, stating: "Reforming the previous attitude of suppressing speech, we will not restrict fair criticism, but we will particularly focus on newspapers in guiding public opinion. We will not interfere with the content of newspapers. The emergence of a sense of war fatigue, etc., is actually due to newspapers not recording the true facts. We hope to quickly implement the policy of respecting speech. In the event of emergencies such as air raids, news reports should be more vibrant. At the same time, governors and police chiefs should provide accurate materials to prevent rumors. Furthermore, the Information Bureau should strive to utilize civilian personnel when implementing propaganda and enlightenment."</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association proposed the following policies to strengthen information and propaganda. Director Ogata expressed his approval and assured that he would work in this direction, strengthening the people's trust in military and political affairs, so that there would be no gap between the reality of the war situation and the people's thinking, in order to thoroughly reform the information and propaganda policy.</p>
<p>Do not let the people indulge in safety. The government should let the people know the truth of the current situation, so that they will not waver in any environment.</p>
<p>When guiding speech, do not add unreasonable restraints. Grasp the people's psychology and do not miss opportunities. Especially in the newspapers, break the current passive control policy. Each newspaper should have its own characteristics and compile fresh and lively content to promote national sentiment.</p>
<p>The information and propaganda organs affiliated with each province should be integrated into the Information Bureau, so that it is responsible for strengthening unified tasks.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that ideological warfare is the final deciding factor in war, the Information Bureau should have the character of an "ideological warfare" headquarters.</p>
<p>Regarding the public's expression of political opinions, it should be treated in the same way as the activities of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society. (翔: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 10th)</p>

Thai Prime Minister Aphaiwong's statement to Prime Minister Koiso: As I assume the position of Prime Minister of Thailand, I hereby assure Your Excellency that Thailand and Japan will not only maintain their original friendly relations but will also further strengthen them with unwavering efforts. I firmly believe that the Japanese Empire under Your Excellency's leadership will continue to support Thailand and establish lasting peace and prosperity in Greater East Asia. I wish the Japanese Empire success and victory. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement to the Thai Foreign Minister: I would like to express my deep congratulations on Your Excellency's appointment as Thai Foreign Minister. The Imperial Government and the allied government of Thailand are determined to cooperate sincerely. I am deeply pleased with Your Excellency's determination to work to enhance the friendly relations between Japan and Thailand. I would like to express the same determination. As the good opportunity to defeat the enemy is approaching, cooperation between the two countries should be strengthened in order to achieve common goals. The Thai Foreign Minister stated: As I assume the position of Thai Foreign Minister, I am determined to make the greatest efforts to enhance the traditional friendly relations between Japan and Thailand. I hope that Japan will continue to assist our country, and I wish the Japanese Empire's efforts success as scheduled, and that the eternal peace and happiness of the peoples of Greater East Asia can be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Bougainville Continue Guerrilla Warfare, Recapturing the Enemy's First-Line Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the South Pacific base, Japanese forces in Bougainville ambushed newly landed enemy troops on the left bank of the Gaba River (approximately four kilometers south of Torokina Point) on August 10th. With limited forces, they resolutely defended their positions and launched repeated surprise attacks on the enemy, continuing guerrilla warfare. On the evening of the 19th, with reinforcements from the Japanese forces in the Warega area (ten kilometers south of Gaba), they launched another fierce attack, capturing the enemy's first line of positions on that day and compressing the enemy towards the coast. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, they finally drove the enemy away from the coast.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Japanese Army Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 27th, approximately seventy enemy small aircraft attacked the Papuan region of New Guinea. The Japanese forces stationed there immediately engaged them in combat, shooting down one and causing considerable damage to forty others, forcing them to retreat.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – In order to open the Ledo Road, the Chinese army in Burma, under the supervision of enemy American forces, repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's positions on the Salween River front. The Japanese defense forces ambushed the offensive of the numerically superior Chinese army, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient troops as much as possible. With hand grenades and bayonet charges, they severely damaged the Chinese army and resolutely defended various key points. The Chinese army in front of La Meng fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's positions for three days, from the 18th to the 20th. On the morning of the 20th, they launched a full-scale offensive, engaging in fierce bayonet charges with the Japanese defense forces. They are still engaged in bloody fighting. The Chinese army in front of Tengyue suffered heavy losses due to a Japanese counterattack on the 16th. However, on the morning of the 18th, they reorganized their remnants and launched another fierce attack on the Japanese army, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese defense forces for two full nights, and were completely repelled in an instant on the 19th. On the 20th, under the cover of a third artillery bombardment, the Chinese army broke through a part of the city wall. When the Chinese army attempted to break into the city, they were repelled by the Japanese army. On the 18th, the Chinese army repeatedly attacked four times, and under the cover of more than ten aircraft and concentrated artillery fire, they attempted to invade the city through the breach in the city wall. The Japanese army fought bravely day and night, overcoming the difficulties of fighting with a small number of troops, and continued to engage in bloody fighting. From the 13th to the 20th, the comprehensive war results obtained in the defense of Tengyue amounted to at least eight hundred Chinese army corpses abandoned, while approximately one hundred Japanese soldiers were also killed in action. In the Longling area, at dawn on the 18th, the Chinese army fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's positions with more than three thousand shells and launched a large-scale assault, engaging in a heroic hand grenade and bayonet charge with the Japanese army. They were repelled after about an hour. On the morning of the 19th, the Chinese army launched another attack, and on the 21st, they fiercely attacked the Japanese army's positions again for about three hours, finally breaking into the Japanese army's positions on the northern highlands of Longling, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese defense forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Truk Fighting Heroically</h3>
<p>Truk Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – From Saipan Island, Guam Island, and Tinian Island to Truk Island, it takes no more than four hours by plane. The morale of the Japanese garrison on Truk Island is high. Whenever enemy aircraft attack, the heroic Japanese fighter pilots immediately take to the skies to engage them, intercepting enemy aircraft. On the other hand, they engage in submarine activity, attacking enemy ships, or intensifying land warfare training under intense air raids, constructing fortifications. The combination of blood, sweat, and mud fully demonstrates the hard work spirit of the Japanese soldiers on the front lines. Recently, enemy aircraft have been attacking very intensely, sometimes in dozens, sometimes in a few. The Japanese air force also often sends the same number of aircraft and skilled pilots into the air to intercept them, using a spirit of determination to make up for the lack of materials. This kind of superhuman action often surprises the enemy. All the land positions are fully prepared for enemy air raids. Air raid shelters are being built that cannot be destroyed even by 500-kilogram bombs. Other work to expand the positions is still continuing day and night. On the other hand, in order to prevent the enemy from landing, they are fiercely engaged in land warfare training, either in the hot weather or in the rain, training without interruption. At the same time, in order to prevent the supply routes from being cut off by the enemy, they are establishing self-sufficiency measures for food, opening up wasteland, and have planted potatoes, pumpkins, and cucumbers, etc., with very good results. In this way, the comprehensive preparations have been completed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Youth Labor Movement Reaches Its Highest Point; Working Diligently in Factories to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese young men and students, in order to win the war and create a new history, have initiated a labor movement. At present, this movement is expanding and has reached its highest point. Members of the Japanese Navy News Corps and the Literary Suicide Squad, after visiting students participating in factory labor, expressed their impressions as follows: The term "students" includes university and secondary school students. At present, most schools at all levels in Japan have suspended classes, and all students have gone to factories to participate in work. However, this month, they attend school once a week for classes. From next month, the method may be changed to allow students to concentrate on learning various technologies, completely converting them into the most elite weapons of the shipyard. So I thought that those who wielded such weapons would naturally be the old workers of the shipyard, and the newly joined students would only stand in the distance and watch. However, when I gradually entered the interior of the factory, what surprised me and exceeded my expectations was that those who managed the cranes or held iron hammers were all young students who were still studying. When I saw this situation, I almost doubted my own eyes. Look, that group busy turning the crane, without a guide introducing them, I knew they were young patriots. Those who are hammering rivets, those who are punching holes, none of them are workers from the industry. I also visited once a large cargo ship of tens of thousands of tons under construction. There was also a group of students busy hammering rivets at the bottom of the ship. They were exposed to the scorching sun like fire and baked by the coal fire of the iron smelting furnace. Inside and out, it was extremely hot everywhere. But they still continued to work hard to complete their mission. A group of young middle school students gathered together and desperately carried steel plates. A team was enthusiastically manufacturing rollers. Originally, one skilled worker was required to watch the furnace, but none of them were students majoring in science and engineering, all of them were students majoring in liberal arts. Although it is factory work, because the young students have clear minds, they can complete the task in a quarter of the time of ordinary people. Their advantages are not limited to this. Because they work in the factory with true enthusiasm, they especially show a fresh and lively phenomenon. Although they are working hard all day, they are gradually gaining practical experience in factory management and factory management methods. So now we can go one step further and draw a conclusion that even if the students do not go to school at all, there is nothing worth worrying about. The young students are voluntarily working hard for the country in this way.</p>
<h3>German Forces in Defensive Battle Southeast of Paris; Enemy Advancing Towards the Marne River Bend</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to German reports: Southeast of Paris, American forces are advancing from the bridgeheads of Melun, Fontainebleau, Nogent, and Troyes towards the Marne River Bend (where the Marne flows east into the Rhine River), encountering strong resistance from the German forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Anti-Axis Military Strategy</h3>
<p>Berlin, August 28th (Central Overseas News Agency) – As we predicted, the American army has now concentrated more mobile troops on the extreme right wing of the invasion of Europe's front line, which is located in the large bend of the upper reaches of the Seine River. After the enemy troops advanced to the city of Troyes at the end of last week and advanced forward, they are now approaching Romilly and Nogent. The American vanguard has even crossed the Seine River near Nogent. There are currently three possible strategies for the anti-Axis forces: 1. Advance towards Chalon and Reims, implementing their northern flank plan, in order to encircle the German forces along the Seine River on a large scale, and can make great use of tank convoys for combat in the Compiègne Plain. 2. Advance eastward into Nancy, breaking into the mountainous region of Western Lorraine, but will encounter difficult terrain. 3. Attempt to break into Burgundy, advancing towards the Swiss border through Dijon and Besançon, in order to cut off the retreat route of the German forces in southern France and prevent them from contacting the main German forces. Judging from the current situation, if the enemy forces cannot adopt the above three strategies at the same time, they will at least adopt two of them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Resumes on the Franco-Italian Border</h3>

The British and American forces are attacking Saint-Paul, attempting to recapture the Maddalena Pass, but are blocked by the resistance of the German forces.</p>

The Japanese army suddenly began to attack again, forming a fan-shaped offensive westward from the Beijing-Hankou Railway, reaching the key points of Biyang, about 48 kilometers northeast and 40 kilometers east of the Queshan-Biyuan Highway.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) reported: Fierce fighting continued in the Hengyang area on the 26th and 27th.

<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Liuzhou Airfield</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft squadrons attacked Liuzhou, a stronghold for the Chinese army's counteroffensive, on the night of the 28th, destroying one large aircraft, burning six aircraft on the ground, and inflicting considerable damage on ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. Although the attack could take advantage of moonlight, the heavy cloud cover made navigation difficult. The Japanese bomber squadron arrived over the target at approximately 10:00 PM, first identifying a Chinese aircraft parked on the runway and immediately dropped bombs, setting it on fire. They followed up with a wave of attacks, confirming that they had burned six Chinese large aircraft, destroyed one large aircraft, and destroyed many ground facilities.</p>
<h3>Yu Mei Army Watching: Japanese Next Operation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: After the fall of Hengyang, the movements of the Japanese army have attracted much attention from the Yu Mei (Chongqing-America) forces. There are many speculations about the Japanese army's next move. Both the Yu and US sides are convinced that the Japanese army's next operation will definitely be to break through along the Xiang-Gui battle route into Guilin and Liuzhou in Guangxi, on the one hand going south to open up the Yue-Han (Guangdong-Hankou) railway line. The Yu Mei armies each have different ideas under the threat of the Japanese army, and therefore are making different plans. A Yu military spokesperson met with reporters and said that the Japanese army is currently concentrating on the west bank of the Xiang River, its first goal being to attack the Yu army west of Hengyang, and at the same time preparing to attack Guilin, the provincial capital of Guangxi, along the Xiang-Gui Railway. It is further predicted that a large-scale attrition battle will be launched before the next operation. It is said that the US military's plan to land on the Chinese coast will not be frustrated by the Japanese army's Hunan operation. If the US military can land, the Yu army can also attack the coastal areas. To cover up from the eyes and ears of the people, the Yu side greatly exaggerates the fierce counterattacks around Hengyang and the attack on the Japanese army around Yichang. The purpose of this public announcement is to restore the recognition of American newspapers, thereby increasing aid to Yu. Nimer, the United States, had long anticipated the inside story of the Yu side, so Reuters and other American newspapers have made the following comments: The Yu army's military operations in the west of Yichang and Hankou are aimed at containing the Japanese army in southern Hunan from attacking Guilin. However, Yichang and Hankou have become solid fortresses, and the Yu army lacks tanks and heavy weapons, so its operations will be difficult to succeed. According to front-line news, about ten divisions of the Yu army reinforcing Hengyang are gathered on both the east and west banks of the Xiang River, deploying troops in Yongfeng and Jinlan. However, they have been attacked by the Japanese army everywhere. The Yu army's counterattacks in the areas of Fengling, Anren, and Leiyang have also been frustrated by the Japanese army. The Yu side's counterattack on Yichang is only for publicity and has no real strength. Under the threat of the Japanese army's next operation, the Yu Mei army is quite frightened. The New York Times said: If the Japanese army starts to attack Guilin and Liuzhou, the US Air Force will have to retreat to Yunnan. Such pessimistic statements about sacrificing the Yu army on the mainland to echo the counterattack plan in the Pacific make the United States even more anxious and worried.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Eastern Foothills of the Carpathians: Soviet Forces in Romania Occupy Buzau</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Yesterday, the Soviet army, with superior forces, advanced south from the lower reaches of the Prut River and occupied Buzau, 45 miles northeast of Ploesti (the Romanian oil area). The German army is still engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles on both sides of the lower reaches of the river. The fierce battle in the eastern part of the Carpathian Mountains has begun on the Hungarian border. The German-Hungarian Allied forces are fighting hard against the enemy, and the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. West of Baranov in the Vistula River bend, there have been frequent battles with advances and retreats. Northwest of Modon and Turbat (in Estonia), the Soviet army launched a new offensive. The German army repelled several Soviet troops during the counterattack.</p>
<p>Budapest, 29th (Central News Agency) - The total strength of the Soviet army on the current Romanian front is 60 to 70 divisions, which are advancing south along the Black Sea coast, and the progress of the Soviet army attacking Ploesti and Bucharest is quite rapid. The German army was temporarily surrounded by the Soviet-Romanian forces in the Kishinev area, but the German army successfully broke out and has concentrated in the Galati area, giving priority to guarding the lower reaches of the Douro River and the passes of the Carpathian Mountains with its main force. There are different opinions on the Soviet army's intentions. It is generally believed that it will advance south with its entire army, directly approaching the foothills of the Carpathians, in an attempt to occupy Romania and then threaten Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>Dynamics in Southeastern Europe Worth Watching</h3>
<p>If necessary, a part of the troops will be divided to attack the German army in Bulgaria and isolate Greece, and another part will enter Serbia to contact Tito's army, so as to attack Hungary from the south. Another part will strengthen the Kragujevac Expeditionary Force to attack the German industrial areas of Styria and Slovakia. In the next week or two, the dynamics in Southern Europe will be more worthy of attention. When this situation unfolds, new situations in the Adriatic Sea and Turkey must also be watched carefully.</p>

<h3>Economic Security Office Exposes Illegal Sale of Rice: Rice Control Association Staff Evade Procurement and are Investigated</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Economic Security Office has spared no effort in cracking down on the hoarding of major commodities, raising market prices without authorization, and engaging in malpractices in the operation of related goods in the city. In particular, it has attached special importance to the transportation and sale of food rice, and has successively discovered many cases of evading rice procurement. Among the cases that have been exposed, some Rice Control Association staff colluded with rice merchants to illegally apply for rice transportation permits, breaking them into smaller quantities to evade procurement. This behavior not only hinders the policy of controlling rice, but also directly affects the people's food supply, causing no small harm. Therefore, after confirming the investigation, it has successively sent the cases to the local procuratorate for investigation in accordance with the law. The details of the two cases are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Li Shouliu, a staff member of the Rice Control Association, in addition to working in the Rice Control Association, jointly established the Yufeng Rice Store in Songjiang with several relatives. Li Shouliu used his position to illegally obtain 14 rice transportation permits, four in the first time and ten in the second time, transporting the rice to Shanghai for sale and profit. Li Shouliu and other investors, Li Meng and Li Chuansheng, were summoned to the office for investigation and found to have committed the act of selling their positions. Therefore, they have been sent to the local procuratorate for legal action.</p>
<p>On July 20th of this year, the Shanghai Shen Bao published a short news item "Where does the large amount of rice come from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce?". After investigation by the office, it was confirmed that Chen Yuan, a section chief of the Rice Control Association, and clerk Rong Huiren, in the name of some staff members of the Rice Control Association, assisted the rice merchant Bao Mingxiang in illegally obtaining 18 rice transportation permits, transporting 180 dan of rice from Henglin, Changzhou to Shanghai for sale and profit, breaking them into smaller quantities to evade procurement. The investigation has been confirmed, so the above three suspects have been sent to the local procuratorate for legal action on the charge of selling their positions.</p>
<h3>Illegal Profit-Making Will Be Strictly Cracked Down</h3>
<p>The office previously received a confidential report that some bread manufacturers instructed people to buy bread ration coupons outside, while receiving a large amount of rationed flour from the Flour and Noodle Control Office to make bread, which was sold in the city to make profits. On July 21st and July 26th, the office successively seized two bread factories engaged in this malpractice at No. 1317 Yuyuan Road and No. 91 Dengtuo Road. One was established by the Russian ABRIRKIN, and the other was established by the German Jew MALLACH. The price of bread ration is 22.8 yuan per pound, while the black market price is as high as 50 yuan. After deducting the cost of buying ration coupons, a net profit of more than 20 yuan per pound can be obtained, which has a significant impact on the people's food supply. It is now known that ABRIRKIN sold about 240 to 420 pounds of bread per day at black market prices in June and July, earning a profit of about 5,000 to 8,000 yuan per day. He has also purchased 61 sets of rations for August and September, totaling 3,600 coupons, preparing to illegally sell the bread obtained from these ration coupons. As for MALLACH, because he only recently started this illegal business, the scale is still small. He has purchased 90 ration coupons for August and September, preparing to sell the bread at black market prices. The details of the above two cases and the malpractices of other manufacturers are still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Thrift Association Asks Police to Strictly Prohibit Daoist Rituals and Promote National Banquet Regulations</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association has spared no effort in promoting various thrift affairs under the wartime system. Recently, as the early autumn season has arrived, there are many local ruffians and hooligans in the city who are holding Daoist rituals in the name of epidemic prevention and disaster relief, profiting from them. Such superstitious actions that waste money and manpower have long been repeatedly banned by the authorities. However, many citizens are still deceived by them. Therefore, the association has sent a letter to the police and Baojia authorities to tighten up the ban measures. The Baojia chiefs in various places are to dissuade them nearby. If local hooligans dare to force them, they can report to the police for arrest and punishment. Otherwise, if Daoist rituals are still found in the area, the Baojia chief will be responsible for dissuading them. At the same time, the Thrift Association has formulated the "Shanghai Special City Thrift Association's Promotion of Thrifty Banquet Measures" in accordance with Article 20 of the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Outline. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Social Welfare Bureau for approval. The Thrift Association is also planning to organize thrift inspectors to station in various restaurants to take responsibility for inspection. If any violations of the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Outline are found, the investigation results will be reported truthfully to the relevant authorities for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Youth Movement and People's Movement in the City Have Been Unified</h3>
<p>Due to the re-division of the administrative area of the city, the organization of the City New Movement Association and the Youth League in the city has also changed. Xi Peiwen, secretary-general of the City New Movement Association and deputy commander of the City Headquarters of the Youth League, made the following statement: After the re-merger and division of the administrative area of the city on the first day of the month, the New Movement Branch Associations and Youth League Branch Headquarters in various districts of the city should also be changed accordingly. All handover matters have also been completed. The special districts such as Chongming, Jiading, Baoshan, Fengxian, Nanhui, Shenjiang, and Chuansha have all been changed to county branch associations and county headquarters of the Youth League. As for the youth movement, the youth organizations in the city, according to their nature, those related to youth and teenagers will be merged into the Youth League, those that are not necessary to exist will be dissolved, and those that are necessary to continue to exist will be reorganized separately, and will be guided and supervised by the City New Movement Association. This time, it will be adjusted again due to the change of the administrative area of the city. From now on, all school headquarters of the Youth League in the city will be directly controlled by the City Headquarters. Out-of-school youth will be managed by five district leagues. As for the New Movement, in the past, it focused on publicity, but in the future, it will enter the practical stage.</p>

The rice for the second half of this month will be sold from the 2nd of next month, 2 liters per person, and the price is 70 yuan in Central Reserve Notes.</p>

<h3>Extending Empathy and Showing Compassion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a donation of 10,000 yuan from a confidential donor, which is deeply appreciated. We also received a letter from Wang Juegan, a student of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School. He donated his prize money of 500 yuan from participating in the Mandarin speech contest to the scholarship fund, which is commendable. The original letter said: "Sir: I am a student of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School. This time, the University Weekly Newspaper Society organized a Mandarin speech contest. I felt that the biggest reason for the lack of unity among our compatriots is the inability to unify the language. Therefore, I boldly participated in this speech contest, not measuring my shallow talent. Fortunately, I won the third place in the middle school category and received a prize of 500 yuan from the society. I originally planned to buy some toys as a souvenir. Later, I thought that my family situation was still good, so I could receive high school education. However, I don't know how many poor young people cannot receive higher education. Extending empathy, I am willing to donate all the prize money I received today to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to fulfill my duty of mutual assistance, and to express my respect for your newspaper's enthusiasm for caring for out-of-school youth."</p>

<h3>Customs Detains Goods, Must Obtain a Receipt</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 1727 yesterday, stating that the customs should issue a receipt for the detained goods. This has been stipulated in the relevant regulations and has been announced and notified many times. It is now found that recently, merchants often do not know to obtain the receipt when their goods are detained, so that the identity of the owner cannot be proved, and there is no way to investigate the cases, which not only increases the difficulty of handling cases by the customs, but also damages the interests of the owner. For this reason, it is re-announced that the owner of the detained goods must obtain the receipt from the customs officer on the spot and immediately report it to the head of the Supervision Section on the ground floor of the Customs Building on the Bund, or to the place where the case occurred. If it is too late, they can also submit a detailed written report for verification. Do not delay. If the merchant has a written appeal for the detained goods, the number of the receipt for the detained goods should be noted, and there is no need to submit the receipt with the application, so that it can be used to collect the goods when they are returned. In addition, if the merchant has a written appeal regarding the detained goods or the dutiable value of the declared goods, it should be submitted to the Secretariat on the third floor of the Customs for submission to the Customs Commissioner for handling.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee to End at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee, which was established in Shanghai last year by the Executive Yuan of the National Government to crack down on hoarding and speculative speculation and to suppress prices, has made good achievements in investigating cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and matches, soap, candles, and other materials related to people's livelihood in the urban area for one year. Now, because the work of this materials investigation is being carried out by the local competent authorities, the Materials Investigation Committee is no longer necessary. Therefore, it was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting at the beginning of this month to abolish it. It is now learned that the Materials Investigation Committee has received the order from the Executive Yuan to abolish it and is handling the closure. Because there are still many investigation procedures that have not been completed and need to be decided to transfer the procedures, the committee decided to hold a final meeting at the beginning of next month to determine all closure matters.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production Promotion Association Transferred to the Direct Jurisdiction of the Municipal Government</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau Announcement</h3>
<p>— Jing Si Zi No. 18</p>
<p>It is found that the city is actively promoting electricity conservation recently. All factories, groups, and residences should comply with it. However, considering that there are many factories in the city, such as those producing military supplies and daily necessities, if the electricity is also restricted, it will have a great impact on wartime production. Therefore, in order to clarify the situation of each factory's products and electricity consumption, the bureau will give appropriate increases in electricity to factories producing military supplies and daily necessities, otherwise, strict restrictions or power cuts will be imposed. This approach aims to promote wartime production while adapting to wartime thrift. All factories in the city are requested to bring their factory seal and the private seal of the person in charge to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to collect and fill out the form within one month from the date of publication. Each form costs 100 yuan in national currency for printing costs and handling fees. If they fail to report within the deadline, it will be regarded as a voluntary waiver and the power line will be cut off without exception. This announcement is hereby made for general knowledge.</p>
<p>August 28, 33rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Director Xu Tianshen</p>
