<p>社評</p>
<h3>米統會的新任務</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會自改派陳國權氐為主任</p>
<p>委員後，已於十五日召集第一次全體委員會</p>
<p>議，宣佈改組成立。陳　並發表談話謂：「</p>
<p>以過去一年之經騐，針對弊害，草定三十三</p>
<p>年度採購計劃，及組織人事之調整方案，一</p>
<p>俟擬就決定後，自當本諸計劃，以求逐步實</p>
<p>現。」在這寥寥數語中，我們認爲巳經把握</p>
<p>了革新來糧統制的關鍵。我們過去對於米統</p>
<p>會的批譯與建議，最為嚴格，最為詳盡。而</p>
<p>歸納言之，第一是健全人事，第二是採辦的</p>
<p>合理化，第三是促進糧食增產。過去米統會</p>
<p>工作失敗，主要的是人事不健全，以不分健</p>
<p>全的人事，縱有良法美制，也必推行無效，</p>
<p>適得其反。况且米糧統制還是前無先例的創</p>
<p>舉呢！健全人事的條件，是用人唯才，吸引</p>
<p>專家，賞罰嚴明。其次，採辦合理化，主要</p>
<p>的是規定收買價格，顧到農民成本與合理利</p>
<p>潤，與採辦數量公平普遍，使農民出售米糧</p>
<p>，並不存有痛苦與犧牲的心理。統制收賭，</p>
<p>終是消本的辦法，唯有促進糧食增產才是積</p>
<p>極的。因為收購配給，最後仍須仰給生產，</p>
<p>生產不機，則收賭配給皆徒託空言。所以，</p>
<p>米糧統制機關的最終目標，在於如何採辦合</p>
<p>理？刺激糧食增產。</p>
<p>孟子說：「天時不如地利，地利不如人</p>
<p>和」。這兩句話，實在可以引用到今日的米</p>
<p>糧統制上。今年啨雨調和，產米地區均慶豐</p>
<p>熟，這是取得了天時的條件。江南及蕪湖一</p>
<p>帶，均為富庶之區，自從長沙衡陽占領以後</p>
<p>，湘米更為鹽盛，這是取得了地利的條件。</p>
<p>不過，天時不如地利，地利不如人和，雖然</p>
<p>有了天時地利，而沒有人和，則並不能獲得</p>
<p>天時地利的利益，豈不　負了天時地利的優</p>
<p>良條件？所以，米統會今後工作的重點，應</p>
<p>以如何取得「人和」為最大目標。</p>
<p>德富蘇峯翁在本報八月十三日星期評論</p>
<p>中說：「今日的需耍，與其說是兵器增產或</p>
<p>食糧增產，勿寗說是人和增產。如人和充溢</p>
<p>於全國，則兵器可以增產，食糧也自然可以</p>
<p>增產。……最重要者，是使人心悅誠服，就</p>
<p>是說爭取人和。為達此目的，則為政者第一</p>
<p>要信賴國民，第二要敬重國民，第三要聽取</p>
<p>國民之聲，第四要停止官僚本位政治，而實</p>
<p>施國民本位政治。」這是已經具體說明了人</p>
<p>和的重耍與取得的方法，頗足供一般行政，</p>
<p>尤其是米糧統制當局的參考。</p>
<p>秋收即屆，新毅登塲，米統曾擬訂收購</p>
<p>計劃，唯一的原則，使農民心悅誠服，順利</p>
<p>收購。過去在收購上所得的反響與惡果，最</p>
<p>明白的唯有米統會本身，如何「針對弊害，</p>
<p>確定新計劃」？也唯有米統會最為適任。過</p>
<p>去因收購不合理，致使農民發生消極的厭種</p>
<p>燮糧的心理，更應深切認識，而挽回農民心</p>
<p>理的時機，就在今秋的收購之際，必須認淸</p>
<p>把握。</p>
<p>總之，今秋的收購工作合理與否，為米</p>
<p>糧統制成敗的關鍵所在；而米統會能否取得</p>
<p>人和，尤為收購工作成敗的關鍵所在。如能</p>
<p>取得人和，則今秋收購工作得以順利完成，</p>
<p>並可消滅農民的畏懼心理，而促進今後的米</p>
<p>糧增產。這樣，就是米糧統制工作整個成功</p>
<p>。至於組織與人事方面的調整，自屬必要手</p>
<p>段，如果說換了湯而不換藥，可以使病量然</p>
<p>，雖孩提亦不置信。我們但觀米統會新當局</p>
<p>能否兌現就任談話的支票？以及商統會能否</p>
<p>負起監督指道的連帶責任而已？</p>
<h3>日小磯首相闡明大政翼贊會方策　分由政治精神兩方面進行</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日小磯首相，十六日下午二時以大政翼贊曾</p>
<p>總裁資格，詣日比谷翼贊會本部覆新，並召集緒方副總裁，小細事務總</p>
<p>長及全體職員等訓話，茲誌其大意如次：大政翼贊會之目的，乃在樹立</p>
<p>國民守職奉公之體制及謀臣善實踐體制之實現，故吾人欲達到此目的，</p>
<p>必須由兩方面進行，第一，由政治方面進行，第二，由精神方面進行。</p>
<p>吾人須知，於大政翼贊運動中，翼贊政治曾乃向政洽方面邁進者，而其</p>
<p>他各團體乃係從事精神方面之活動者，故希望各位今後在此方針下，向</p>
<p>前邁進。然翼贊精神運動之具證方策如何，要言之，可分物質及精神兩</p>
<p>面，即於精神方面，須堅定必勝信念，並昂揚戰意，應忍受生活環境之</p>
<p>艱苦，各位應與政府立於同一立塲，以最大努力維持一般國民最低限度</p>
<p>之生活，同時，更應極力促醒同胞對決戰生活之覺悟。</p>
<p>日推舉建川中將任翼贊壯年團長</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電關於日</p>
<p>本翼贊壯年圑國長後任問題，前</p>
<p>經小磯總裁再三愼重遴選後，茲</p>
<p>已決定推舉前駐蘇大使建川美次</p>
<p>陸軍中將，並於十六日由翼贊會發表聘令。又建川中將就任圑長後，現</p>
<p>任翼壯中央本部部長亦曾再三呈請辭職，故該會中央本部部長或將於最</p>
<p>近更迭，衆料新任本部長一席，常以赤誠會統令橋本欣五郞太佐呼聲最</p>
<p>高。</p>
<h3>衡陽附近　激戰仍未已　日軍部隊猛攻渝軍</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央</p>
<p>社電據重慶電，渝軍當</p>
<p>局十五日夜發表公報稱，</p>
<p>衡陽附近戰鬥，十四日竟</p>
<p>日未停。日軍增援部隊於</p>
<p>攸縣附近攻擊渝軍，激戰</p>
<p>微夜。</p>
<p>醴陵渝軍損折甚重</p>
<p>江</p>
<p>西前</p>
<p>綫十</p>
<p>六日</p>
<p>中央社電　七月末日在麻</p>
<p>山附近展開殲滅戰之日軍</p>
<p>，曾俘獲渝第五十軍第十</p>
<p>師第二十九團本部上等兵</p>
<p>黃延魁（二十歲）一名，</p>
<p>目下以使了之身分，隨日</p>
<p>軍轉戰。當其被虜之時，</p>
<p>彼瘦弱之極，但現已恢復</p>
<p>健康。目前對記者交談稱</p>
<p>，余生於福建，從事漁業</p>
<p>，因强制破微入伍，從車</p>
<p>入五十八軍，在醴校萍鄉</p>
<p>一役，折師甚衆，令已喪</p>
<p>盡再戰能力。二十九團陣</p>
<p>亡者，有中隊長七名，殘</p>
<p>餘兵卒由副官指揮，其一</p>
<p>連新兵中，逃亡六十二名</p>
<p>。據傳日軍殘虜異常，實</p>
<p>際却較渝方和悅，上官亦</p>
<p>甚親切。軍中糧食多於渝</p>
<p>軍，渝美空軍前來援戰，</p>
<p>似足慶幸。然誤認渝軍為</p>
<p>日軍，盲目轟炸，余之隊</p>
<p>伍亦曾遭逢數次，死傷甚</p>
<p>衆。</p>
<p>衡陽經濟價値重大</p>
<p>北</p>
<p>平十</p>
<p>六日</p>
<p>中央</p>
<p>社電衡陽陷落，實給予</p>
<p>重慶當局以極大打擊。十</p>
<p>三日延安新華社，以「湖</p>
<p>南作戰與後方經濟」為題</p>
<p>，對衡陽之經濟價値加以</p>
<p>論述，同時對喪失衡陽之</p>
<p>重慶經濟力之脆弱，予以</p>
<p>指摘，且示以諷刺態度，</p>
<p>其要旨如次：湖南與四川</p>
<p>為重慶二大倉庫，其主要</p>
<p>工廠則集中於衡陽。工</p>
<p>廠種類有冶金·機械·洋</p>
<p>灰·電力·紡織·造紙·</p>
<p>火柴·酒精·汽油·紙煙</p>
<p>等。中國唯一汽車零件壞</p>
<p>造工廠，亦即在衡陽附近</p>
<p>之祁陽。該工廠之發動機</p>
<p>製造能力，每星期為一輛</p>
<p>，該地並有年產三千三百</p>
<p>萬加侖之酒精工塲，此等</p>
<p>生產品，全部供給昆明·</p>
<p>成都·重慶·各都市，於</p>
<p>經濟上實佔極重要之地位</p>
<p>。自衝陽紙烟禁止外運，</p>
<p>及自湖南戰區禁向內地輸</p>
<p>出棉布後，所引起後方物</p>
<p>價高漲之事實，即為顯明</p>
<p>例證。衝陽機械工業，年</p>
<p>產額在一億元以上，故喪</p>
<p>失衝陽及衝陽之工廠，不</p>
<p>啻為致命之打擊。湖南作</p>
<p>戰，即將開始之際，重慶</p>
<p>雖亦曾準備將工廠移入後</p>
<p>方，但以汀桂鐵路，每日</p>
<p>逃難民衆擁擴之故，僅極</p>
<p>少部分遷至桂林。又全中</p>
<p>國十三種重要礦物資源之</p>
<p>中，湖南最為豐富，埋藏</p>
<p>有銻鉛，亞鉛錳等，而銻</p>
<p>之產量，則居世界第一。</p>
<p>此外金錫·金錫·石灰·</p>
<p>鐵石·炭鐵等之產量亦甚</p>
<p>豐。此次作戰，產錫之常</p>
<p>寗，產鉛之水口山，產錳</p>
<p>之湘潭，產金之平江，產</p>
<p>銻之益陽，產錫金之茶陵</p>
<p>等地，均完全喪失。如吾</p>
<p>人稍對此等不以甚大勞力</p>
<p>即能開掘之豐富炭礦，及</p>
<p>理藏相當體富之礦產一加</p>
<p>注意，今日已盡入日軍掌</p>
<p>握，重慶所受之打擊可想</p>
<p>而知也。</p>
<h3>陳誠遞充戰區司令</h3>
<p>北</p>
<p>京十</p>
<p>五日</p>
<p>中央</p>
<p>社專電　傳重慶第一戰區</p>
<p>司令長官蔣鼎文退任後，</p>
<p>己任命陳誠遞充。七日陳</p>
<p>誠以戰區司令資格，於西</p>
<p>安舉行演請，題為「應如</p>
<p>何實踐三民主義」。據該</p>
<p>方消息，過去第八戰區陳</p>
<p>誠麾下，以監視延安行動</p>
<p>為任務，三十四集團軍胡</p>
<p>宗南部，現仍歸於陳誠部</p>
<p>下。今胡宗南被任第一戰</p>
<p>區副司令，該司令部現設</p>
<p>於西安。查河南作戰時，</p>
<p>淪第一戰區轄境內之洛陽</p>
<p>失陷，司令蔣鼎文遂被免</p>
<p>職，然湯恩伯部隊仍盤踞</p>
<p>於河南省南陽魯山附近，</p>
<p>為謀恢復過去之名譽，不</p>
<p>時盲目轟動，但均爲日軍</p>
<p>壓制，陷於沒落之途。胡</p>
<p>宗南於過去一年餘，擔當</p>
<p>包圍延安之任務，陳誠在</p>
<p>過去為期與中共妥協，專</p>
<p>依胡宗南從中處理，是故</p>
<p>國共關係之推移，亦甚堪</p>
<p>注目云。</p>

<h3>日為世界第二　飛機生產國　遠藤中將昨發表談話</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社</p>
<p>電　在此決戰階段，增產</p>
<p>飛機之任務，賞最重大，</p>
<p>日航空兵器總局長官遠藤</p>
<p>中將，頃特發表談話如次</p>
<p>：敵恃物量龐大，故能製</p>
<p>造大量飛機，根據彼等之</p>
<p>宣傅，雖不知其確數，但</p>
<p>傳每月生產量在八千架乃</p>
<p>至九千架之問，然我人對</p>
<p>此決不驚異。我方生產力</p>
<p>雖不及敵方，但亦有其相</p>
<p>當量，在昔機械工業最發</p>
<p>達之英國，非我人所及，</p>
<p>又如當時曾超過美國以上</p>
<p>之德國以及强國蘇聯，今</p>
<p>日我人已追越彼等之上，</p>
<p>故今日之日本，已為世界</p>
<p>第二之飛機生產國。美國</p>
<p>雖有每月八千架以上之生</p>
<p>產量，但不能全部就役。</p>
<p>試觀目下之決戰塲，彼等</p>
<p>之後方連褚如何，必須跨</p>
<p>越遙遠之太平洋而來，勿</p>
<p>論決戰塲接近日本土與否</p>
<p>，直接轟炸內地雖屬不利</p>
<p>，但在日本用兵上，因連</p>
<p>絡綫縮短，故而有利，吾</p>
<p>人於此條件下，日本並非</p>
<p>不能勝利。</p>
<h3>日動員女工　增强生產</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社</p>
<p>電　日本小磯內閣於本月</p>
<p>八日閣議中決定之「里子</p>
<p>工員配置之規正」，乃其</p>
<p>增强勞動行政之第一步，</p>
<p>頗堪注目，在國內代為戰</p>
<p>塲之現在，重工業礦業方</p>
<p>面之動員，與軍部動員，</p>
<p>實應相併前進，為謀完成</p>
<p>此計劃，乃澈底增强女子</p>
<p>之動員。此種措置之主眼</p>
<p>，在軍需工業部門之事務</p>
<p>者與作業者，分設女子使</p>
<p>用標準率，依此規定，增</p>
<p>强動員能力。同時並限制</p>
<p>用男十工員，隨時將女子</p>
<p>代替男工，調入更重要之</p>
<p>勞動塲所，以期勞力配</p>
<p>之適切與勤勞總力之昂揚</p>
<p>。此次措　，女子使用標</p>
<p>準率，乃依照事業特質及</p>
<p>勞力之輕重而定，然若以</p>
<p>純理論之女子之勞動分配</p>
<p>比率，將可提高芳干，例</p>
<p>如飛機體及其零件之作業</p>
<p>部門，普通規定女子工員</p>
<p>為全體之四成，然而實際</p>
<p>可增多至八成，現在之工</p>
<p>塲，女子尙有超出全體入</p>
<p>成以上，且能發揮甚大之</p>
<p>勞力者，女工非為代男子</p>
<p>而工作，實乃供給前綫戰</p>
<p>力之後方原動力也。</p>

<p>仰光十六日中央社</p>
<p>電　緬甸政府設立大緬甸</p>
<p>聯明後，積極團結緬人，</p>
<p>展開活潑之運動，該聯盟</p>
<p>事務總畏達金奴氏，十五</p>
<p>日就該運動之目的及方針</p>
<p>，分述如次：大緬甸聯盟</p>
<p>雖係由巴墕新愛薩黨改組</p>
<p>而成，然較諸過去更具有</p>
<p>强大之實踐力，尤其大緬</p>
<p>甸聯盟，以融合各民族為</p>
<p>重心，團結進羅人，琴族</p>
<p>人，將種族差別親念完全</p>
<p>取消，以期邁向協力戰爭</p>
<p>，政府與人民渾然打成一</p>
<p>體，參加此運動，如斯始</p>
<p>能繁榮細甸，完成大東亞</p>
<p>戰爭。</p>
<h3>民船代表與　當局懇談</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社</p>
<p>電　五月十五日當局實施</p>
<p>緩和內河航運限制以來，</p>
<p>三十噸以下之小型民船，</p>
<p>因準許自由行動，利便尤</p>
<p>多，航運發展，深堪期待</p>
<p>。惟因各地施策參差不一</p>
<p>，致船戶負擔過事，</p>
<p>當局原旨，故上海·蕪湖</p>
<p>·杭州·揚州·贛江·江</p>
<p>陰·等地民船代表，曾於</p>
<p>本月十五日在京集合，與</p>
<p>建設部日大使館當局，舉</p>
<p>行促進航運懇談。結果以</p>
<p>各地軍警對民船微稅過多</p>
<p>，且檢查過檠，民船負擔</p>
<p>過重，為阻害航運之最大</p>
<p>原因。當局表示今後決嚴</p>
<p>加取締，各代表聞悉後，</p>
<p>深為感激。今後為適應時</p>
<p>局，決加倍努力，促進航</p>
<p>運。</p>
<h3>美軍强徵農田　與鄕民衝突</h3>
<p>太原十大日中央社</p>
<p>電　最近成都消息，成都</p>
<p>西南五十公里之農民，因</p>
<p>美第十航空隊建設飛機塲</p>
<p>，將該地東南郊約値七八</p>
<p>萬元一畝土地，在愛國美</p>
<p>名下。以二萬五千元一畝</p>
<p>折價，移於美國應用。現</p>
<p>已數月，但其地價迄未付</p>
<p>淸，因之農巨（極感不滿，</p>
<p>已三度向美空軍士兵裂</p>
<p>，殺傷美人數十名，農民</p>
<p>中亦　牲甚多，其事更有</p>
<p>險惡化之勢。因此省政府</p>
<p>乃出動軍隊前往彈壓，川</p>
<p>省主席張羣，亦已親自出</p>
<p>面調解。</p>
<h3>日軍新武器　「海上輕戰車」　在南海各地大事活躍</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日軍之「海上轉</p>
<p>戰車」出現後，又增加一大偉力，所謂海上輕</p>
<p>戰車，乃指用膠合板製造之大型機艇而言，陸</p>
<p>軍船舶兵所操縱之此種舟艇，在加達卡那爾島</p>
<p>登陸及南海補給戰中，曾於各地大事活躍，實</p>
<p>乃近代之精妙武器。製造此種舟艇，可代　鐵</p>
<p>製大型機艇，蓋因從來之機艇，全用鐵製，茲</p>
<p>為克服鐵之困難，乃全易以膠合板，其堅固性</p>
<p>則不亞於鐵製者，費用及製造時間，僅為從來</p>
<p>若于分之一，由於此種輕舟艇之出現，日本之</p>
<p>造船技術，實可誇耀於世。</p>

<h3>方先覺將軍投誠披瀝對和運信念　決盡力於新中國建設</h3>
<p>衡陽十五日中央社電　渝第十軍長方先</p>
<p>覺，於衡陽抗戰四十餘日，終於力盡投降，九</p>
<p>日下午方中將接見記者，問答如次：（問）無</p>
<p>條件投降後，現在心境如何？（答）敗將應不</p>
<p>談兵事，過去對日軍兵力評價過小，而恃鞏固</p>
<p>之陣地與駐華美空軍之協力，從事抗戰，世結</p>
<p>果終為日本軍精神力所挫。余舉全力爾戰，雖</p>
<p>敗亦無遺憾，今後當投身和平陣營，決盡力於</p>
<p>新中國之建設。（問）對過去之抗戰生活有如</p>
<p>何感想？（答）本人自黃埔軍官學校畢業後，</p>
<p>迄令始終身為軍人，為國效勞，殆無異義。但</p>
<p>鑒於八年之抗戰，民衆犠牲過大，尤其最近對</p>
<p>抗戰救國，更為懷疑。我等身為軍人，立於抗</p>
<p>戰方面，雖屬艱苦，亦當盡其天職，然喘息於</p>
<p>貧困之工者，則大部份為民衆，有閒階級似已</p>
<p>無國家觀念矣。本人雖目賭此種不合理之抗戰</p>
<p>態勢，但因不明中國之現狀，及世界之情勢，</p>
<p>故乃從事盲目之抗戰。今後新中國之建設，諒</p>
<p>當益有飛躍之進展。</p>
<p>（問）投效和運是否</p>
<p>仍為軍長？（答）此固係</p>
<p>本人之意見，同時亦為四</p>
<p>師長及全體幹部之意見。</p>
<p>自經日軍勸吿後，即披歷</p>
<p>投效之決意，是時並無一</p>
<p>人反對者。（問）今後之</p>
<p>方計如何？（答）余乃一</p>
<p>介武夫，　不能充分表白</p>
<p>個人之意念，然日軍對於</p>
<p>敵將如此厚待，實屬感激</p>
<p>萬分。今後如若可能·當</p>
<p>携帶目下避難於桂林方面</p>
<p>之家屬及部下全體，而爲</p>
<p>建射新中國效勞。（問）</p>
<p>重慶將兵對於抗戰將來之</p>
<p>觀　如何？（答）因事變</p>
<p>之長期化，故重慶將士之</p>
<p>間，對於抗戰前途，均感</p>
<p>悲觀，令巳無人能相信抗</p>
<p>戰建國者。然對新中國之</p>
<p>確實狀態，亦不了解，故</p>
<p>斷然拋棄抗戰觀念，而從</p>
<p>事和運者較少。若能了解</p>
<p>日本交還租界，撤廢治外</p>
<p>法權，及實施對華新政策</p>
<p>之道義精神，則當欣然參</p>
<p>加和運也。本人而今洞悉</p>
<p>新中國建設之情狀，關於</p>
<p>緬甸菲律賓之獨立，印度</p>
<p>臨時政府成立，以及大東</p>
<p>亞共同宣言之祟高理念，</p>
<p>及大東亞建設之理念等，</p>
<p>余遂開始暸解矣。（問）</p>
<p>知去年龐將軍及陳敎强將</p>
<p>軍，參加和運之事否？（</p>
<p>答）陳將軍為黃埔軍官學</p>
<p>校第一期先擊，分離後音</p>
<p>信少通，但自巴與陳將軍</p>
<p>有非當緊密之友誼關係。</p>
<p>龐將軍前曾任胡宗南軍之</p>
<p>師長，從來聽說參加和平</p>
<p>陣營。（問）對於汪主席</p>
<p>之觀念如何？（答）汪主</p>
<p>席乃我等於軍校時之敎官</p>
<p>，故對其事績甚詳，如蒙</p>
<p>允許，欲趨南京忝謁，以</p>
<p>便請示和平建國之方策。</p>
<p>（問）欲睹和平地區之實</p>
<p>况否？（答）實欲領略和</p>
<p>平地區之實情，更欲作漢</p>
<p>口或南京之行，如蒙許可</p>
<p>而有機會時，尙欲訪問日</p>
<p>本。</p>

<h3>法國南岸三據點侵歐軍實行登陸　遭遇德守備部隊堅强抵抗</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：英美軍於星期二晨，在法國南</p>
<p>部三處自海上與空中運兵登陸，登陸地點為　土倫（Toulon）以東菩</p>
<p>姆（Bormes）附近，　坎尼（Cannes）與尼斯（Nice）之間，　聖</p>
<p>拉斐爾區（ST.Raphael）。德軍立即開始反攻，與登陸敵發生激戰，</p>
<p>坎尼與尼斯間海岸區若干點之激戰，現仍在進行中。據海通社探得登陸</p>
<p>之詳情稱，敵機猛襲馬賽·土倫·與尼斯區已有數日，至星期一晚益形</p>
<p>加緊，最近在科西嘉海面出現之英美登陸船隊駛近法國海岸，平明敵軍</p>
<p>一小隊，在士倫以東菩姆附近登陸，惟其大部被殲，數小時後，英美運</p>
<p>輸機約一百架，拖帶滑翔機飛向法國海岸，增援在音姆登陸之英美軍，</p>
<p>同時敵軍另一批在坎尼與尼斯問自海上登陸，反軸心國轟炸機隊與軍艦</p>
<p>大砲掩　登陸，德國海岸防禦隊立即與登陸部隊發生激戰，不久以後，</p>
<p>英美傘兵約一團在聖拉斐爾區降陸，特拉蒙（Dramont）港西北敵軍</p>
<p>亦另圖登陸未逞。</p>

<h3>南法沿海地勢平坦爭奪土倫將有激戰</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社</p>
<p>電　海通社訊：反軸心軍</p>
<p>在法南岸之新登陸行動，</p>
<p>事前早巳有此象微，故不</p>
<p>足引為驚異，德軍在義大</p>
<p>利中部及科西嘉各港，偵</p>
<p>悉敵方集中大量船隻已有</p>
<p>多時，美第五軍之堅强部</p>
<p>隊之調離阿諾前綫，自亦</p>
<p>與此行動有關。至於敵之</p>
<p>新登陸企岡，將否亦在執</p>
<p>諾亞灣實行，以呼應義境</p>
<p>內之攻勢，或在法南登陸</p>
<p>後，將否同時開始西進，</p>
<p>則尚屬疑問。但德軍司令</p>
<p>部對此，已有應變之策。</p>
<p>反軸心今亦採取在話曼第</p>
<p>登陸之作戰技術，在法甫</p>
<p>派大量傘乓降陸，反軸心</p>
<p>軍今在坎尼與土倫間之海</p>
<p>空登陸，乃巧避該處之要</p>
<p>塞而獲實現。該處沿海極</p>
<p>為平坦，士倫迤西及馬資</p>
<p>兩面，地勢廣平，向北通</p>
<p>入羅尼河流域，敵軍遲早</p>
<p>當將利用坦克車，企圖進</p>
<p>入該區，但先須奪得大</p>
<p>港爲根據地，始能奏效，</p>
<p>故爭奪土倫根據地之大戰</p>
<p>，當即將展開。</p>

<p>以前，即對法國南海岸軍</p>
<p>事設施及交通路綫，加以</p>
<p>猛烈轟炸，尤其馬賽港地</p>
<p>區。敵機投下人形炸彈，</p>
<p>圖分散德軍注意力，一方</p>
<p>反軸心軍登陸艦艇羣，自</p>
<p>科西嘉島西岸諸港出動，</p>
<p>德偵察機發見該艦艇羣後</p>
<p>，即刻進擊。一面報告德</p>
<p>軍沿岸警備隊，因此反軸</p>
<p>心軍十四日深夜企圖在土</p>
<p>倫港東方三十公里之普姆</p>
<p>附近登路時，德軍早已整</p>
<p>備邀擊。登陸用舟艇羣接</p>
<p>近海岸時，德軍沿岸砲臺</p>
<p>砲火齊發，與以重創，其</p>
<p>登陸步隊陷入德軍地當陣</p>
<p>地，幾全軍覆滅。此次登</p>
<p>陸企圖，僅在牽制或偵察</p>
<p>德軍兵力，激戰一二小時</p>
<p>後，至十五日拂曉反軸心</p>
<p>軍以聖位斐爾與卡曼拉角</p>

<p>約一大隊之降落傘部隊，</p>
<p>降落於德軍第一綫後方，</p>
<p>但該部隊遭德軍猛烈砲擊</p>
<p>，己受重創。目下反軸心</p>
<p>軍戰車僅在聖特羅貝士地</p>
<p>區登陸成功，德軍地實陳</p>
<p>地發揮偉大威刀，阻止敵</p>

<h3>山西省的　糧食增產</h3>
<p>山西省的農產物供</p>
<p>應，獲得非常的成功，</p>
<p>成功的原因，為推動强</p>
<p>大的行政力量所致。今</p>
<p>年山西省的農產物，以</p>
<p>小麥為主，省南部的河</p>
<p>東道及冀寗道，刈麥告</p>
<p>終，正入蒐集的時期。</p>
<p>今年度山西省增物對策</p>
<p>，有下項各項：</p>
<p>增產對策</p>
<p>以省·</p>
<p>道·縣各</p>
<p>行政機關</p>
<p>為主體，</p>
<p>在其强力企劃統制之下</p>
<p>，實行合作社制度。</p>
<p>與耕作計劃的統制同時</p>
<p>進行的，是增產施策重</p>
<p>點的强化，賦與生產的</p>
<p>堅實性和蒐集政治性，</p>
<p>以期確保積極的增產。</p>
<p>一切都是計劃的生產，</p>
<p>重點作物爲小麥·水稻</p>
<p>·雜毅。棉花。馬鈴曹</p>
<p>等五種，耕作面積，收</p>
<p>穫預計量，供出數量的</p>
<p>生產目標，使其獨立，</p>
<p>在現在的狀熊度下，貫</p>
<p>澈計劃，獲得省內農民</p>
<p>的切實信仰，不復抱着</p>
<p>盟時「有錢難買五月呈</p>
<p>，六月連雨吃飽飯」的</p>
<p>觀念了。</p>
<p>今年依着上述的計</p>
<p>劃進行，今年度應提出</p>
<p>的供應物，除小麥·雜</p>
<p>穀·水稻（白米）。棉</p>
<p>花·馬鈴薯外，還有食</p>
<p>油和豆類，自省南部始</p>
<p>，全省各縣自信心增大</p>
<p>，產生對於必要供出量</p>
<p>的絕對性，而確保生產</p>
<p>，所以為開發水田新規</p>
<p>而派遺强制指導員，供</p>
<p>給資金資材，關於小麥</p>
<p>·雜榖·棉花等實行種</p>
<p>子消毒，施肥改善，灌</p>
<p>溉施設的增强，更謀增</p>
<p>加馬鈴薯的耕作面積，</p>
<p>以期絕對的蒐集。</p>
<p>配給制度</p>
<p>山西省的</p>
<p>經濟政策</p>
<p>，是用强</p>
<p>制方法，</p>
<p>維特獨得的低物價政策</p>
<p>，從公定價格上看，與</p>
<p>華北其他各省，有相富</p>
<p>的縣隔，去年度實施收</p>
<p>買的公價，較前年提高</p>
<p>，今年保持原狀，決定</p>
<p>强制推行此項政策。推</p>
<p>究一般物價的高騰，不</p>
<p>免覺得無理，為補救起</p>
<p>見，山西省乃再度實行</p>
<p>民生政策。此即對於一</p>
<p>般生產者，確立配給制</p>
<p>而予以實施，此點對於</p>
<p>生產者發生非常好感，</p>
<p>這種配給曰制，已繼績</p>
<p>年之久，戶口調查完成</p>
<p>後，配給更見餘裕，例</p>
<p>如太原市的配給制度，</p>
<p>每月的預算量，自今年</p>
<p>以來，已相當减少，其</p>
<p>差額以數百噸計。對於</p>
<p>重要產業的從事者，確</p>
<p>保配給量，固無待言，</p>
<p>對於一般生產者，亦確</p>
<p>保其配給量，不特此也</p>
<p>，即對於一般公務員，</p>
<p>也保說其配給，最近對</p>
<p>於高物價應付十分順利</p>
<p>，今年度的山西糧食供</p>
<p>出施策，必予以確實的</p>
<p>基礎。</p>
<p>當局方面早已聲明</p>
<p>今年度的收買價格，維</p>
<p>特原狀，因為山西的低</p>
<p>物價政策，依存於農產</p>
<p>物價格的低立性，公定</p>
<p>價格若予以變更，當然</p>
<p>一般經濟，要遭受影響</p>
<p>，不得不從長考慮。山</p>
<p>西維持其低物價，一面</p>
<p>對他省實行輪出，依其</p>
<p>所生的差額，使一般生</p>
<p>產者得到物資。農產·</p>
<p>畜牧上的福利，發揮相</p>
<p>當效果。為確保五種重</p>
<p>點作物的生產量，在可</p>
<p>能範國內，實施各種研</p>
<p>究與對策。像山西這樣</p>
<p>的多山岳的省份，樹立</p>
<p>像今年一般的水稻生產</p>
<p>量確保計劃，而且排除</p>
<p>非常的困難，以底完成</p>
<p>，眞値得大書特書。至</p>
<p>少在山西的日軍及日本</p>
<p>人，可保證無缺少白米</p>
<p>飯之愛，實屬難能可貴</p>
<p>運輸問題</p>
<p>今年山西</p>
<p>省農產物</p>
<p>的收獲，</p>
<p>預算可較</p>
<p>往年多收三成以上，人</p>
<p>民均安居樂業，以滿腔</p>
<p>感意，從事決戰的協刀</p>
<p>。但現在普這於華北的</p>
<p>運輪問題，尤其是際此</p>
<p>食糧收獲期，蒐集與運</p>
<p>送問題，不得不加以考</p>
<p>慮。山西省已進行各種</p>
<p>對策，以解除困難，汽</p>
<p>油不足之後，又換了一</p>
<p>副新景象。例如去年度</p>
<p>，有國策公司的運貨汽</p>
<p>車為助，並以當地車馬</p>
<p>為主體實行輪送，今年</p>
<p>度，全省確立車馬和家</p>
<p>畜徵用的動員計劃。徽</p>
<p>用依據全定價格，供給</p>
<p>食糧。同時省內又獎勵</p>
<p>亞洲舊式的運輪法，即</p>
<p>由人力背負轍送。一般</p>
<p>省民受了戰時奉公觀念</p>
<p>的陶治，發生自供運動</p>
<p>，際此蒐集輸送之期，</p>
<p>此種意識，愈益旺感了</p>
<p>。今年旣値　收之年，</p>
<p>敵匪方面也躍躍欲動，</p>
<p>南部省境，已成激戰之</p>
<p>所。當地保安隊警察隊</p>
<p>獲得日軍的援助，實行</p>
<p>警備，以策萬全。農民</p>
<p>們亦矢願與新政權協力</p>
<p>。敵匪出沒中的南部各</p>
<p>縣，獲得供出量達百分</p>
<p>之百以上的成功，山西</p>
<p>的糧食戰，今年又奏着</p>
<p>凱歌一路邁進。（譯自</p>
<p>八月四日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>一包以上麺粉　移動須得許可　一包以內移動不受限制</h3>
<p>政府富局爲安定民生，對於米糧麵粉强化統制，嚴厲取締國積居奇</p>
<p>，故規定取締移動辦法，極為周密。現悉尙有一股市民，不明麵粉移動</p>
<p>規則，法有市民負肩麵粉而遭富局沒收者，不勝枚舉。茲據中央社記者</p>
<p>向有關當局探悉，凡一包以上之麵粉，非向主管富局申請許可，不得移</p>
<p>動，一包以內之麵粉，則不限制移動，希市民注意，而協力政府推行統</p>
<p>制政策。</p>
<p>申請搬移物資希申請人自辦</p>
<p>商統會辦理物資搬移，設有許司事</p>
<p>務所，專司許可給證，一年以來，辦理</p>
<p>尚構順利。本年八月起，商統會改組，</p>
<p>許可事務所劃點管理處管轄，經將內部</p>
<p>力加整飭，對於申請物資搬移，迅速公正，隨到隨辦，不許有所積壓，</p>
<p>無論何人前去申請者，均照一定程序，審查給證。近聞有申請人往往委</p>
<p>託第三者代為辦理申請手續，希圖提前取得許可證，而第三者則乃利用</p>
<p>機會，到處招搖，力任代辦，致申請人不明眞象，受其欺朦等情事發生</p>
<p>。商統會為杜絕此種弊病起見，已嚴飭該所收發人員密加注意，對於申</p>
<p>請書，務要隨到隨辦，不得稍有積壓，一面切望申請人，親目前往江西</p>
<p>路漢彌登大樓許可事務所辦理各項手績，萬勿再受第三者之愚弄，致受</p>
<p>損失。</p>
<h3>次期戶口米　定二十日配給　每人仍為二升價格相同</h3>
<p>本市戶口米自於本月</p>
<p>十日開始恢復配給以來，</p>
<p>數量旣不减少，米質又甚</p>
<p>潔白，市民無不表示感戴</p>
<p>，惟旬日之期。轉瞬即屆</p>
<p>，次期食米，何日開始配</p>
<p>發，以及數量價格，有無</p>
<p>變更，一般市民均極注意</p>
<p>。記者為明瞭眞相起見，</p>
<p>特趨訪本市物品配給處馮</p>
<p>處長，承發表談話云：本</p>
<p>市市民戶口米，前因來源</p>
<p>不暢，停配數期以來，一</p>
<p>般市民莫不呌苦運天，陳</p>
<p>市長亦為此苦心焦慮，不</p>
<p>寗處，經與盟邦當局數</p>
<p>度磋商結果，業巳獲得大</p>
<p>批接濟，因此入月份上旬</p>
<p>本市戶口米，得能繼續配</p>
<p>給，數量旣不减少，且米</p>
<p>質甚佳，良深欣慰。嗣後</p>
<p>各期戶口米，均可按照預</p>
<p>定計劃，繼績發配，決無</p>
<p>脫期之虞。關於此點，本</p>
<p>月初旬，陳市長已有談話</p>
<p>發表報端，毋庸贅述，至</p>
<p>下期本市戶口米，決定於</p>
<p>本月二十日開始配發，每</p>
<p>人仍為二升，價格與上期</p>
<p>相同。</p>

<h3>讀者助學消息　天眞的哀告！純潔的乞憐！　一個落選學生的來信</h3>
<p>自從發表了小學初中核准助金學生名單以</p>
<p>後，陸繼接到很多落選學生的來信，莫不充分</p>
<p>流露着天眞的哀告，表示着純潔的乞憐，這裹</p>
<p>引用的「哀告」與「乞憐」字樣，澈底的說，與</p>
<p>時髦人訃告上的袞咎，壯年流民伸手對錢的乞</p>
<p>憐，絕對不同，一邊是假意的技術的。一邊是</p>
<p>天眞的純潔的。我們也都是薪水階級，我們的</p>
<p>子女也都有被助的資格，所以讀了這一類信，</p>
<p>更瞑目一想倌中所狀的一幅書面，不禁發出心</p>
<p>底深處的同情，實在沒有生花之筆道達出來，</p>
<p>足以引起社會有力人士，個個發動一念之善，</p>
<p>捐　助金，使每個落選學生都得完成其繼學目</p>
<p>的。這裹摘錄一個初中二的學生來信，境遇是</p>
<p>比較普遍的，他說：「我是一個參加申報助學</p>
<p>金考試的學生，自從考試那一天以後，沒一天</p>
<p>不是翻閱着申報，希望榜上有名，得到補助，</p>
<p>但是前天（八月十日）早晨翻開報紙，看見名</p>
<p>單發表了，查來查去，竟查不到有我的名字，</p>
<p>這使我悲傷極了，我相信一定是我的成績不及</p>
<p>格，才會落選，我不怪家中不僱傭人，使我在</p>
<p>署假中整日幫着母親作雜差，並且給弟弟補習</p>
<p>功課，使我自已精疲力盡，再沒有時問和精力</p>
<p>溫習自己的功課，使她更有進步，我也不怪家</p>
<p>中經濟力薄弱，使我必需一心一意的希望獲得</p>
<p>助金，我袛怪自已天賦庸劣，以致名落孫山，</p>
<p>但想到父親為着一家生活，已焦頭爛額，時常</p>
<p>獨自像患神經病般，算着家中的收支，母親自</p>
<p>淸早到晚上，工作得彎腰曲背，無復人形，我</p>
<p>不想再增加他們一筆龐大的負擔。因此，我沒</p>
<p>有助學金，我祗得停止求學了。父親雖則和我</p>
<p>說：「　　，你莫急，待我想想辦法看。」但</p>
<p>我很知道經過七八年的困苦掙扎，父親已一無</p>
<p>所有，為了領取戶口配給品需耍的三五百元錢</p>
<p>的欵子，尙且時常累得無決接濟，那裏還有什</p>
<p>麼能力來借三四千元錢給我繼續學業，他這話</p>
<p>，無非是在無辦法中安慰女慰我，安慰安慰他</p>
<p>自已罷了。父親一生志氣高昂，所以我不敢給</p>
<p>他知道我在寫着這封向你們乞憐的信，但是根</p>
<p>據下列數點，我懇求你們可否考慮考慮，仍舊</p>
<p>給我一個援救的辦法，免得我失學，因爲失學</p>
<p>便成文盲，等於發廢人。</p>
<p>我父親是個純薪水階級，非但「淸寒」</p>
<p>，實在已到「貧無立錐之地」了。</p>
<p>我平日很肯勤讀，我的成績，不及他人</p>
<p>的優秀，並非我不肯用心，實在是因為我須分</p>
<p>擔家中一部份工作，自修的機會太少了的緣故</p>
<p>我萬分希望能縱續學業，增加智慧上的</p>
<p>食糧。先生，倘使一個飢渴垂斃的人，他是多</p>
<p>少相獲得食和水，甚於人類互助的這義上，甚</p>
<p>於我向學心切的志願上，看在上帝的仁愛上，</p>
<p>請你們無論如何，分我杯羹，免得我失學，免</p>
<p>得我盲人瞎馬，在這極容易被人類淘汰的世界</p>
<p>上，成為一個殘廢者，成為一個淘汰者。先生</p>
<p>，我寫到這裏，心中難過極了，羞愧極了，我</p>
<p>哭了，先生，我相信你們若然看到我的環境和</p>
<p>我可憐可憫的情形，你們一定會同情我，而在</p>
<p>可能範圍內援助我的。</p>
<p>請你們可憐我焦急不安的情緖，忙中抽空</p>
<p>，給我一個回音，因為我若盼望不到你們的回</p>
<p>音，我一定會無時無刻不難過得耍發狂了」。</p>
<p>告慰一部分落選的學生</p>
<p>本屆甄試後未能錄取</p>
<p>的學生共有三千餘人，我</p>
<p>們說過，這三千餘人中大</p>
<p>部分是成續優秀的，應該</p>
<p>給予補助而不予補助的原</p>
<p>因，是為了助學金數目不</p>
<p>敷分配，只得愛莫能助。</p>
<p>可是，我們還是抱着一綫</p>
<p>希望，竭力期望讀者諸君</p>
<p>，尤其殷富巨賈，有力人</p>
<p>士慷慨捐輪，在這兩句之</p>
<p>中，多收到補助一人的綫</p>
<p>，就多補助一人。欣幸的</p>
<p>很，旬日之中，承各界給</p>
<p>紛捐助，前天並蒙廬楚僧</p>
<p>先生經算一二百萬元鉅款，</p>
<p>我們決定增加補助小學組</p>
<p>二百人，初中組三百五十</p>
<p>人，高中組二百五十入，</p>
<p>大學專科組二百人，總共</p>
<p>一千人。這可告慰於一部</p>
<p>分落選的學生。我們對於</p>
<p>盧先生的熟忱，挽救了一</p>
<p>千學生的失學，安慰了一</p>
<p>千學生及其家屬的惶急，</p>
<p>誠是功德無量。同時盼望</p>
<p>有力人士，再接再厲，繼</p>
<p>賴輸將，還有二千學生等</p>
<p>待着哩！</p>

<h3>交通大學學費問題</h3>
<p>— 法俊</p>
<p>報載「京國立名校確定收費數目：國立中</p>
<p>央大學八百元：」，閱後深覺政府措置合理。</p>
<p>因國家富强，必須有多量人才。無人才之國家</p>
<p>，必成為他國附庸。但人才之之生長，必依靠</p>
<p>敎育栽培。是故敎育之優劣決定國家之强弱，</p>
<p>亦可謂決定一國之能否生存於此淘汰之世界中</p>
<p>。故世界各國對於敎育，皆極端重視。現在中</p>
<p>央大學學費八百元，處物價高昂之今日，確能</p>
<p>吸收大量學生，然後就中選擇富天才堪造就者</p>
<p>，施以國家所希望人才之敎育。於是方能有人</p>
<p>才輩出，文明水準提高之一日。這始是向復興</p>
<p>之途邁進之道。</p>
<p>回顧上海國立交通大</p>
<p>學，則不覺黯然失色。蓋</p>
<p>學校方面曾通告謂，學費</p>
<p>每生五千元，與中央大學</p>
<p>相比，合六倍有餘。眞屬</p>
<p>百思不得其解。若謂京滬</p>
<p>物價有別，則至多相差數</p>
<p>成，決不至一倍，更無論</p>
<p>如何不至有六倍之不同。</p>
<p>此其一。若謂國家並不需</p>
<p>要，交大所造就之人才，</p>
<p>則筆者因就讀於工學院，</p>
<p>故略述工程方面者。</p>
<p>吾人試硯衣食住行以</p>
<p>及一切用品，那件不需工</p>
<p>業製造或加工。如米須經</p>
<p>電力磨研，加飯須置於鋁</p>
<p>工業製成之鋼精飯鍋中，</p>
<p>以機器製成之煤球煮之。</p>
<p>餘可槪見。至於現代之戰</p>
<p>爭，更全為工業之戰爭。</p>
<p>飛機大炮，戰車兵艦，無</p>
<p>一非工業之產物。總之，</p>
<p>工業實支配吾人之生活，</p>
<p>工業實為決定一切成敗之</p>
<p>要素。環顧國內工程學校</p>
<p>，幾如鳳毛麟角。且交大</p>
<p>有悠久之歷史，擁有大量</p>
<p>有價値之實騐儀器，紀錄</p>
<p>及敎材等。設備雖較戰前</p>
<p>為劣，然比之他校，仍無</p>
<p>出其右。工業之重要旣如</p>
<p>是，交大之情形又如是。</p>
<p>故日園家必需求交大之人</p>
<p>才。此其二。或謂交大規</p>
<p>模較大，經費過昂，政府</p>
<p>無力負擔，然目今之交大</p>
<p>較之戰前縮小多矣。規模</p>
<p>更不可謂大。學生僅五六</p>
<p>百人，比之大同聖約翰等</p>
<p>，瞠乎其後矣，以堂堂大</p>
<p>國之政府竟不能負擔一數</p>
<p>百人之學府，大有不知從</p>
<p>何說起之感。况政府之收</p>
<p>入舉凡消費特稅，關稅，</p>
<p>烟酒印花稅，及統稅等，</p>
<p>上海無疑佔全國之最大百</p>
<p>分比。是則得於斯者多，</p>
<p>用於斯者亦多，非惟不為</p>
<p>過，且為理所當然。此其</p>
<p>三。</p>
<p>除此三條，別無理由</p>
<p>可言。故令人大惑不解而</p>
<p>疑及校方此舉，敎音當局</p>
<p>或米知悉，或尙未批准，</p>
<p>或係誤批。總之，佐以中</p>
<p>央大學之例，此種矛盾悻</p>
<p>乎情理之舉，六使吾人不</p>
<p>敢相信係賢明敎育當局之</p>
<p>所為。然敎育當局有權予</p>
<p>以合理調整减低，一面將</p>
<p>經費酌予提高。是為目前</p>
<p>最妥善，最合理想，最足</p>
<p>稱頌之措施也。</p>
<p>至於增收之後果，必</p>
<p>為不堪設想。因交大學生</p>
<p>非同別校，淸寒苦　者佔</p>
<p>大多數。蓋往昔無助學金</p>
<p>之舉，淸寒者以其費廉，</p>
<p>每拚命攻讀而考入之。因</p>
<p>為如非交大，則將不勝負</p>
<p>擔而失學也。每屆之投考</p>
<p>生較任何學校為多。故少</p>
<p>數之錄取生中均全國最優</p>
<p>秀之人才。是以皆衣飾淳</p>
<p>樸，勤讀成風。其為國內</p>
<p>外所注目重視，良非無因</p>
<p>。今於咤叱之間竟將費用</p>
<p>提至五百倍。其數對富者</p>
<p>不為多。但對交大學子則</p>
<p>大為多。不能籌措者必居</p>
<p>大多數。</p>
<p>宿願（四）</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩出雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>關於這樣話，隆夫也從母親方面</p>
<p>聽到了。母親對於兒子志頭海事的事</p>
<p>，最初會反對過，所以眞人無論怎樣</p>
<p>好，也總對這件婚事表示猶疑。</p>
<p>「那是技想眞人，眞無辦法。」</p>
<p>「來是枝妹想眞人呵！」</p>
<p>隆夫愈發驚奇了。他從家裘做偷</p>
<p>出走時，妹妹不是仇視眞人的麼？那</p>
<p>以前，眞人到兵學校入學時，對着車</p>
<p>窗不是吵過架麼？</p>
<p>「那末，究竟是什麼時候開始愛的呢？」</p>
<p>隆失覺着非常奇怪，這樣問了一句。</p>
<p>「我雖然不很知道，據你爸爸說或許是技</p>
<p>和眞人在軍艦上的時候——是去年十月——，就</p>
<p>是從那個時候起。」</p>
<p>總而言之，枝妹的樣子是變了。於是她先前</p>
<p>討厭住在鹿兒島，願到東京去學習西洋裁縫，或</p>
<p>是進女子大學等的事情，突然不再提了，願當一</p>
<p>個鄕下女人。</p>
<p>「的確，枝是愛眞人的。」</p>
<p>「那就是女人自己應當明白的……」</p>
<p>母親突然笑了，但又鄕重地說：</p>
<p>「枝從小就喜　眞人的吧！」</p>
<p>「不，並非如此。對於眞人，並非從小就喜</p>
<p>的。</p>
<p>「那末不對吧？女人的心，是不會把討厭者</p>
<p>加以喜愛的——喜歡者就愛他，不喜歡者就不愛</p>
<p>他……」</p>
<p>談到這種微妙關係時，海軍畫家的頭腦亦無</p>
<p>法解釋了，但突然想到自己對「海軍」的情感時</p>
<p>，就瞭解了女人的心，像男人一樣。</p>
<p>不管怎麼樣，隆失是絕對贊成這一婚姻的，</p>
<p>總是希望早日解決這件事。父母為愼重起見，在</p>
<p>微求眞人同意前，想要同谷家父母說，但隆夫却</p>
<p>自願担任與眞人直接談判。</p>
<p>「好吧，我回東京云時，路過吳鎭，與眞人</p>
<p>會面後談談……」</p>
<p>但他很伯妹妹是開玩笑，如果眞是出之於開</p>
<p>玩笑，那就眞對不起眞人了。但枝妹察言閲色業</p>
<p>已曉得底細了，所以非常神經過敏，當兄妹單獨</p>
<p>會面時，總是逃掉的。煞費苦心，一捉住機會時</p>
<p>，隆夫說：</p>
<p>「喂，我將在吳吳鎭會見眞人，你有什麼意見</p>
<p>麼？」</p>
<p>「我不知道。」</p>
<p>似乎不想要總的樣子，她立刻逃出隆夫的視</p>
<p>綫。（一三二）</p>

<h3>The New Task of the Rice Control Committee</h3>
<p>Since the reshuffling of the Rice Control Committee with Chen Guoquan as the new chairman, the first plenary committee meeting was convened on the 15th to announce the reorganization. Chen also delivered a speech, stating: "Based on the experience of the past year, and addressing the drawbacks, a procurement plan for the 33rd year and a plan for organizational and personnel adjustments have been drafted. Once finalized and decided, we will implement them step by step according to the plan." In these few words, we believe that the key to reforming rice control has been grasped. In the past, our criticisms and suggestions for the Rice Control Committee have been the most stringent and detailed. Summarizing, the first is to improve personnel, the second is to rationalize procurement, and the third is to promote increased food production. The failure of the Rice Control Committee's work in the past was mainly due to unsound personnel. With unsound personnel, even if there are good laws and systems, they will inevitably be ineffective and even counterproductive. Moreover, rice control is an unprecedented initiative! The condition for sound personnel is to employ people based on their talents, attract experts, and have clear rewards and punishments. Secondly, the rationalization of procurement mainly involves setting purchase prices that consider farmers' costs and reasonable profits, and ensuring fair and universal procurement quantities, so that farmers do not feel pain or sacrifice when selling rice. Control and purchase are ultimately stopgap measures. Only promoting increased food production is a positive approach. Because procurement and allocation ultimately depend on production. If production is not increased, then procurement and allocation are empty words. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the rice control agency is how to procure reasonably and stimulate increased food production.</p>
<p>Mencius said, "Opportunity is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as popular support." These two sentences can really be applied to today's rice control. This year, the weather has been favorable, and rice-producing areas are celebrating bumper harvests, which is the condition of "opportunity." The areas of Jiangnan and Wuhu are both wealthy regions. Since the occupation of Changsha and Hengyang, Xiang rice has become even more abundant, which is the condition of "geographical advantage." However, opportunity is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as popular support. Even with opportunity and geographical advantage, without popular support, the benefits of opportunity and geographical advantage cannot be obtained. Wouldn't that be a waste of the excellent conditions of opportunity and geographical advantage? Therefore, the focus of the Rice Control Committee's work in the future should be on how to obtain "popular support" as the biggest goal.</p>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on August 13: "What is needed today is not so much increased production of weapons or increased production of food, but rather increased production of popular support. If popular support overflows the whole country, then weapons can be increased in production, and food will naturally also be increased in production. ... The most important thing is to make people happy and sincerely convinced, that is, to win popular support. To achieve this goal, the first thing for politicians is to trust the people, the second is to respect the people, the third is to listen to the voices of the people, and the fourth is to stop bureaucratic politics and implement people-oriented politics." This has specifically explained the importance of popular support and the methods to obtain it, which is worthy of reference for general administration, especially the rice control authorities.</p>
<p>The autumn harvest is approaching, and new rice is coming onto the market. The Rice Control Committee is planning a procurement plan, the only principle of which is to make farmers happy and sincerely convinced, and to carry out procurement smoothly. The negative reactions and bad consequences of procurement in the past are most clearly understood only by the Rice Control Committee itself. How to "address the drawbacks and determine a new plan"? Only the Rice Control Committee is best suited for this. In the past, unreasonable procurement led to farmers developing a negative mentality of disliking planting and hoarding grain, which should be deeply recognized. The opportunity to win back the hearts of farmers is now during the autumn procurement, which must be clearly understood and grasped.</p>
<p>In short, whether the autumn procurement work is reasonable or not is the key to the success or failure of rice control. Whether the Rice Control Committee can obtain popular support is the key to the success or failure of the procurement work. If popular support can be obtained, then the autumn procurement work can be completed smoothly, and the fear of farmers can be eliminated, thereby promoting increased rice production in the future. This would be the overall success of the rice control work. As for the adjustment of organizations and personnel, it is a necessary means. If it is said that only the soup is changed and not the ingredients, which can cure the disease, even children will not believe it. We will only see whether the new authorities of the Rice Control Committee can deliver on the promises made in their inaugural speeches, and whether the Ministry of Commerce will bear the joint responsibility of supervision and guidance.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Koiso Explains Policies of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association - Proceeding from Both Political and Spiritual Aspects</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in his capacity as President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, visited the Hibiya Association headquarters at 2 PM on the 16th to assume his new post and summoned Vice-President Ogata, Secretary-General Kosoba, and all staff members to deliver instructions. The gist of his remarks is as follows: The purpose of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is to establish a system in which the people fulfill their duties and serve the public, and to realize a system of wise ministers and good practices. Therefore, we must proceed in two ways to achieve this goal: first, politically; second, spiritually.</p>
<p>We must know that in the Imperial Rule Assistance movement, Imperial Rule Assistance politics is advancing towards the political aspect, while other groups are engaged in spiritual activities. Therefore, I hope that you will move forward under this policy in the future. As for how to embody the Imperial Rule Assistance spirit movement, in short, it can be divided into material and spiritual aspects. In the spiritual aspect, we must strengthen our belief in victory and uplift our fighting spirit, and we must endure the hardships of the living environment. You should stand in the same position as the government, make the greatest effort to maintain the minimum living standards of the general public, and at the same time, strive to awaken the people's awareness of a decisive war.</p>
<p>Japanese Promote Lieutenant General Tatekawa to Head of Imperial Rule Youth Corps</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the question of the successor to the head of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps, after careful selection by President Koiso, it has been decided to promote former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, and an appointment order was issued by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on the 16th. After Lieutenant General Tatekawa took office as head of the Corps, the current director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Central Headquarters has repeatedly requested to resign. Therefore, the director of the Central Headquarters may be replaced soon. It is widely expected that Hashimoto Kingoro, the commander of the Akachikai, has the highest support for the position of new director.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues Near Hengyang - Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Chongqing Troops</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities issued a communiqué on the night of the 15th stating that the fighting near Hengyang did not stop all day on the 14th. Japanese reinforcement troops attacked Chongqing troops near You County, and fierce fighting continued into the night.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for Chongqing Troops in Liling</p>
<p>Jiangxi Front Line, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops who launched an annihilation battle near Mashan at the end of July captured Huang Yankui (20 years old), a soldier of the 29th Regiment headquarters of the 10th Division of the Chongqing 50th Army. He is now traveling with the Japanese army as an envoy. When he was captured, he was extremely thin, but now he has recovered his health. He told reporters that he was born in Fujian and engaged in fishing. He was forced into the army and entered the 58th Army. In the Battle of Liling Pingxiang, the army suffered heavy losses and lost the ability to fight again. Seven company commanders died in the 29th Regiment, and the remaining soldiers were commanded by the adjutant. Among a company of new recruits, 62 deserted. It is said that the Japanese army is cruel to prisoners, but in reality, they are more kind than the Chongqing side, and the officers are also very kind. The food in the army is more abundant than in the Chongqing army. It seems fortunate that the Chongqing-American air force came to help. However, they mistakenly identified Chongqing troops as Japanese troops and bombed blindly, and my troops were also hit several times, causing heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Significant Economic Value of Hengyang</p>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The fall of Hengyang has dealt a great blow to the Chongqing authorities. On the 13th, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency, under the title "Hunan Operation and Rear Economic Situation," discussed the economic value of Hengyang, while pointing out the fragility of Chongqing's economic power after the loss of Hengyang, and showed a sarcastic attitude. The main points are as follows: Hunan and Sichuan are the two major warehouses of Chongqing, and its main factories are concentrated in Hengyang. The types of factories include metallurgy, machinery, cement, electricity, textiles, papermaking, matches, alcohol, gasoline, cigarettes, etc. China's only auto parts factory is located in Qiyang near Hengyang. The engine manufacturing capacity of this factory is one vehicle per week. There is also an alcohol factory in the area with an annual output of 33 million gallons. These products are all supplied to Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other cities, and occupy a very important position economically. The fact that the prices in the rear have soared since the ban on the export of cigarettes from Hengyang and the ban on the export of cotton cloth from the Hunan war zone to the interior is a clear example. The annual output of Hengyang's mechanical industry is more than 100 million yuan, so the loss of Hengyang and its factories is a fatal blow. When the Hunan operation was about to begin, Chongqing had also prepared to move the factories to the rear, but due to the overcrowding of refugees on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway every day, only a small part was moved to Guilin. In addition, Hunan is the richest in 13 important mineral resources in China, with deposits of antimony, lead, zinc, manganese, etc., and the output of antimony ranks first in the world. In addition, the output of gold, tin, limestone, iron ore, and coal iron is also very abundant. In this operation, Changning, which produces tin, Shuikoushan, which produces lead, Xiangtan, which produces manganese, Pingjiang, which produces gold, Yiyang, which produces antimony, and Chaling, which produces tin and gold, have all been completely lost. If we pay a little attention to these rich coal mines and mineral deposits that can be exploited without much labor, which have now all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, the blow suffered by Chongqing can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Succeeds as Commander of War Zone</h3>
<p>Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency Special Dispatch) - It is reported that after Jiang Dingwen retired as commander of the First War Zone in Chongqing, Chen Cheng has been appointed to succeed him. On the 7th, Chen Cheng delivered a speech in Xi'an in the capacity of war zone commander, entitled "How to Practice the Three People's Principles." According to sources in the area, the 34th Army Group under Hu Zongnan, which was under Chen Cheng's command in the Eighth War Zone in the past, is still under Chen Cheng's command and is responsible for monitoring the activities in Yan'an. Now Hu Zongnan has been appointed as deputy commander of the First War Zone, and the headquarters is currently located in Xi'an. It is known that when Luoyang in the First War Zone fell during the Henan operation, Commander Jiang Dingwen was dismissed. However, Tang Enbo's troops are still entrenched near Nanyang Lushan in Henan Province. In order to restore their past reputation, they blindly attack from time to time, but they are suppressed by the Japanese army and are on the road to decline. For the past year or so, Hu Zongnan has been responsible for surrounding Yan'an. In the past, Chen Cheng was committed to reaching a compromise with the Chinese Communist Party and relied on Hu Zongnan to handle the matter, so the development of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is also worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Kuril Islands Shoot Down Enemy Plane - Frequent Air Raids on Molucca Islands</h3>
<p>Japanese base in the Northern Pacific, 16th (Central News Agency) - On the 13th, several American planes attacked the Northern Kuril Islands twice. The Japanese garrison intercepted them in the eastern sea and shot down a medium-sized plane. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the Southwest Pacific, the number of enemy planes attacking Halmahera Island in the Molucca Islands has increased significantly. On the 12th, two medium-sized planes attacked during the day. On the 14th, more than 20 large and medium-sized planes attacked Ternate to the west of the island during the day. The Japanese air force in the area intercepted them and shot down two enemy medium-sized planes on the 14th. Also, in the Halmahera Island area, the enemy launched attacks on the 13th with 16 fighter-bombers during the day, with 30 planes at dawn on the 14th, and with about 40 planes based on four-engine large planes at night on the 14th. After the Japanese air force fought with the attacking enemy planes, they shot down one of their large planes. Also, on the 14th, 13 enemy four-engine large bombers attacked Babo at the western end of New Guinea Island.</p>
<h3>Regular Meeting of the Central Standing Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its 91st regular meeting the day before yesterday, and resolved to approve the resignations of Peng Shengtian, the director secretary of the Organization Department, and Zhang Zongran, the director. Peng Shengtian, Zhou Zhengyi, and others were appointed as organizational members of the department, Gan Qingjian was appointed as director secretary, and Shen Liusheng was temporarily appointed as director of the fourth office of the department.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army on the Nujiang Front</h3>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese army on the Burmese front, 16th (Central News Agency) - The comprehensive war results of the Japanese army on the Nujiang front in early August were: 2,148 Chongqing troops abandoned their bodies, and 196 Japanese troops were killed in battle.</p>
<p>Front Line on the Sino-Burmese Border, 16th (Central News Agency) - About 20,000 of the enemy's troops carried out a counterattack in the La Meng area, and fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's position from the Nujiang bank with mountain artillery, day and night, firing no less than 3,500 rounds. However, the Japanese army did not move at all. They stopped attacking the position and focused on attacking key points, trying to gradually advance the position. Also, Chongqing's troops attempted to recover Tengyue, a key point in western Yunnan Province. With the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, they continued to carry out scorched earth tactics and increased pressure on the Japanese army, in the hope of trapping it in isolation. However, after a fierce counterattack by the Japanese army, they suffered heavy losses and retreated. In early August, more than 980 bodies of Chongqing troops in the area had been killed in battle, and the Japanese army had captured a large number of ammunition.</p>
<h3>Japan is the World's Second Largest Aircraft Producer - Lieutenant General Endo Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - At this decisive stage, the task of increasing aircraft production is the most important. Lieutenant General Endo, Director-General of the Japanese Aeronautical Weapons Bureau, recently gave a speech as follows: The enemy relies on its massive material resources to manufacture a large number of aircraft. According to their propaganda, although the exact number is unknown, it is said that the monthly production is between 8,000 and 9,000 aircraft. However, we are not surprised by this. Although our production capacity is not as good as theirs, it also has a considerable amount. In the past, the most developed mechanical industry in the United Kingdom was beyond our reach. Germany and the strong country of the Soviet Union, which once surpassed the United States, have now been surpassed by us. Therefore, today's Japan is the world's second largest aircraft producer. Although the United States has a production of more than 8,000 aircraft per month, not all of them can be put into service. Looking at the current decisive battle, how is their logistics connection? They must cross the distant Pacific Ocean to come. Regardless of whether the decisive battle is close to the Japanese mainland, direct bombing of the inland is unfavorable, but in Japanese military operations, the shortening of the communication line is advantageous. Under this condition, Japan is not incapable of winning.</p>
<h3>Japan Mobilizes Female Workers to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The "Regulation of the Placement of Child Laborers" decided by the Japanese Koiso Cabinet in the cabinet meeting on the 8th of this month is the first step in strengthening labor administration and is worthy of attention. Now that the country is acting as the battlefield, the mobilization in heavy industry and mining should advance in conjunction with the military mobilization. In order to complete this plan, the mobilization of women is thoroughly strengthened. The main focus of this measure is to set the standard rate for the use of women in the administrative and operational personnel of the military industrial sector. According to this regulation, the mobilization capacity is strengthened. At the same time, the use of male laborers is restricted, and women are replaced by male workers at any time and transferred to more important labor sites in order to achieve proper labor allocation and the uplift of total labor force. In this measure, the standard rate for the use of women is determined according to the characteristics of the business and the weight of the labor. However, if the theoretical ratio of female labor allocation is used, it can be increased by a lot. For example, in the aircraft body and parts operation department, the ordinary regulation is that female workers account for 40% of the total, but in reality, it can be increased to 80%. In the current factory, there are still women who exceed 80% of the total and can exert great labor force. Female workers do not work on behalf of men, but are the rear driving force for supplying the front-line combat power.</p>
<h3>Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan Goes to Gotemba for Recuperation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, left Tokyo by train for Gotemba at 9 AM on the 16th to rest temporarily.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Burmese Alliance is to Unite the Nation - Complete the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the Burmese government established the Greater Burmese Alliance, it actively united the Burmese people and launched a lively movement. Dakin Nu, the Secretary-General of the Alliance, described the purpose and direction of the movement on the 15th as follows: Although the Greater Burmese Alliance was reorganized from the Ba Swe-Kyaw Nyein Socialist Party, it has more powerful practical capabilities than in the past. In particular, the Greater Burmese Alliance focuses on integrating all ethnic groups, uniting the Karen, Chin, and completely eliminating the concept of racial discrimination, in order to move towards cooperative warfare. The government and the people are completely integrated to participate in this movement. Only in this way can Burma prosper and complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Civilian Ship Representatives Talk Cordially with Authorities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the authorities implemented the easing of restrictions on inland river transportation on May 15, small civilian ships of 30 tons or less have been allowed to move freely, which is particularly convenient, and the development of transportation is deeply anticipated. However, due to the uneven implementation of policies in various places, the burden on shipowners is too high, which is contrary to the original intention of the authorities. Therefore, representatives of civilian ships in Shanghai, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Ganjiang, Jiangyin, and other places gathered in Nanjing on the 15th of this month and held a cordial talk with the authorities of the Ministry of Construction and the Japanese Embassy to promote transportation. As a result, it was found that the excessive taxes imposed on civilian ships by the military and police in various places and the excessive inspections were the biggest reasons for hindering transportation. The authorities stated that they would strictly crack down on them in the future. All the representatives were deeply grateful after hearing this. In the future, in order to adapt to the current situation, they decided to double their efforts to promote transportation.</p>
<h3>US Military Forcibly Requisitioned Farmland - Conflict with Villagers</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to recent news from Chengdu, farmers 50 kilometers southwest of Chengdu, because the US 10th Air Force is building an airfield, the land in the southeast suburb, worth about 78,000 yuan per mu, is being transferred to the United States for 25,000 yuan per mu under the name of patriotism. It has been several months now, but the land price has not been paid off, which makes the farmers extremely dissatisfied. They have attacked US Air Force soldiers three times, killing and wounding dozens of Americans. Many farmers have also been sacrificed, and the matter is becoming more dangerous. Therefore, the provincial government has sent troops to suppress it, and Zhang Qun, Chairman of Sichuan Province, has personally come forward to mediate.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Weapon "Sea Light Tank" - Very Active in Various Parts of the South China Sea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the appearance of the Japanese army's "Sea Mobile Tank," it has added a great force. The so-called sea light tank refers to a large motorboat made of plywood. This type of boat, operated by the army's ship soldiers, was very active in the landing on Guadalcanal Island and in the supply battles in the South China Sea, and is a modern and sophisticated weapon. Manufacturing this type of boat can replace large iron-made motorboats. In the past, all motorboats were made of iron. In order to overcome the difficulty of iron, it is now completely replaced by plywood, and its solidity is no less than that of iron. The cost and manufacturing time are only a fraction of that of the past. Due to the appearance of this type of light boat, Japan's shipbuilding technology can be boasted to the world.</p>

<h3>General Fang Xianjue Surrenders, Expressing Belief in Peace Movement - Determined to Devote Himself to the Construction of New China</h3>
<p>Hengyang, 15th (Central News Agency) - Fang Xianjue, commander of the Chongqing 10th Army, finally surrendered after fighting in Hengyang for more than 40 days. On the afternoon of the 9th, General Fang met with reporters and answered questions as follows: (Question) What is your state of mind now after the unconditional surrender? (Answer) A defeated general should not talk about military affairs. In the past, I underestimated the strength of the Japanese army and relied on the solid position and the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in China to fight against the war. As a result, I was finally defeated by the spiritual strength of the Japanese army. I fought with all my strength, and although I lost, I have no regrets. In the future, I will join the peace camp and devote myself to the construction of a new China. (Question) What are your thoughts on your past life of resistance against the war? (Answer) I have been a soldier since graduating from the Whampoa Military Academy, and I have served the country all my life. However, in view of the eight years of resistance against the war, the people have sacrificed too much, and especially recently, I have become more skeptical about resisting the war to save the country. We are soldiers, and although it is difficult to stand on the side of resistance, we should fulfill our duties. However, the workers who are struggling in poverty are mostly the people, and the leisure class seems to have no national concept. Although I have witnessed this unreasonable situation of resistance against the war, I am blindly resisting the war because I do not understand the current situation of China and the situation of the world. In the future, the construction of a new China will surely make great progress.</p>
<p>(Question) Will you still be</p>
<p>the commander after joining the</p>
<p>peace movement? (Answer) This</p>
<p>is my opinion, and it is also</p>
<p>the opinion of the four division</p>
<p>commanders and all the cadres.</p>
<p>After being persuaded by the Japanese</p>
<p>army, I immediately revealed</p>
<p>my determination to join the</p>
<p>movement, and no one opposed</p>
<p>it at that time. (Question) What is your future</p>
<p>plan? (Answer) I am just</p>
<p>a soldier and cannot fully express</p>
<p>my personal thoughts. However,</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the Japanese</p>
<p>army for treating the enemy</p>
<p>general so kindly. In the future,</p>
<p>if possible, I will bring</p>
<p>my family and all my subordinates</p>
<p>who are currently seeking refuge in the Guilin area</p>
<p>to serve the construction of</p>
<p>a new China. (Question)</p>
<p>How do the officers and soldiers in</p>
<p>Chongqing view the future of the resistance? (Answer) Because of the</p>
<p>prolongation of the incident, the</p>
<p>officers and soldiers in Chongqing</p>
<p>are pessimistic about the future of the resistance. Now, no one can believe</p>
<p>in resisting the war and building the country. However, they do not understand</p>
<p>the exact state of the new China, so</p>
<p>there are fewer people who</p>
<p>abandon the concept of resistance</p>
<p>and join the peace movement. If they can understand</p>
<p>the Japanese spirit of returning the concessions, abolishing extraterritoriality,</p>
<p>and implementing a new policy towards China,</p>
<p>they will gladly participate in the peace movement. I now understand</p>
<p>the situation of the construction of a new China,</p>
<p>the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines, the establishment of the</p>
<p>Provisional Government of India, and the lofty ideals of the</p>
<p>Greater East Asia Joint Declaration,</p>
<p>and the concept of Greater East Asia construction.</p>
<p>I have begun to understand. (Question)</p>
<p>Do you know that General Pang and General Chen Jiaoqiang</p>
<p>joined the peace movement last year?</p>
<p>(Answer) General Chen was a first-term student at the</p>
<p>Whampoa Military Academy. We had little contact after</p>
<p>separation, but General Chen had a close friendship with</p>
<p>Ba. I have heard that General Pang, who used to be the division commander of Hu Zongnan's army,</p>
<p>has joined the peace camp. (Question)</p>
<p>What do you think of Chairman Wang? (Answer) Chairman Wang</p>
<p>was our instructor at the military academy, so</p>
<p>I know his achievements very well. If I am allowed, I would like to</p>
<p>visit Nanjing to ask for instructions on the strategy of peace and national construction.</p>
<p>(Question) Do you want to see the reality of</p>
<p>the peace zone? (Answer) I really want to appreciate the</p>
<p>real situation of the peace zone. I also want to</p>
<p>travel to Hankou or Nanjing. If I am permitted</p>
<p>and have the opportunity, I would also like to visit</p>
<p>Japan.</p>

<h3>Vichy Government Not to Relocate Capital</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram: The movements of the Vichy government after the Anti-Axis forces landed on the southern coast of France have attracted much attention. German external affairs officials stated the following views to a group of journalists on the 15th: As far as the German government knows, the French government must remain in Vichy in the future, and its capital will never be relocated due to changes in the war situation. However, this is an interpretation based on politics. If the war situation changes further, it may change the existing decision. The French government is paying attention to the changes in the war situation and paying more attention to the influence of de Gaulle on the French domestic situation, and will take appropriate measures based on the new situation in the future.</p>
<h3>Invasion troops land on three strongholds on the southern coast of France German defense forces put up strong resistance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) Telegram from Huitong News Agency: On Tuesday morning, British and American troops landed from the sea and air at three locations in southern France: near Bormes, east of Toulon; between Cannes and Nice; and in the Saint-Raphael area. The German army immediately launched a counterattack and engaged in fierce fighting with the landing enemy. The fierce fighting in some areas of the coast between Cannes and Nice is still ongoing. According to details obtained by Huitong News Agency, enemy aircraft have been fiercely attacking the Marseille, Toulon, and Nice areas for several days, intensifying on Monday evening. The British and American landing fleet that recently appeared in the Corsican Sea approached the French coast. At dawn, a small team of enemy troops landed near Bormes, east of Toulon, but most of them were annihilated. Several hours later, about 100 British and American transport planes, towing gliders, flew towards the French coast to reinforce the British and American troops who landed in Bormes. At the same time, another group of enemy troops landed from the sea between Cannes and Nice, covered by anti-Axis bombers and naval artillery. The German coastal defense force immediately engaged in fierce fighting with the landing troops. Shortly thereafter, about a regiment of British and American paratroopers landed in the Saint-Raphael area. The enemy also attempted to land northwest of the Port of Dramont, but failed.</p>
<p>Wilson in Command</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) The commander of the Anti-Axis forces that began landing on the southern coast of France is Lieutenant General Wilson of the British Army, commander of the Anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean. According to a statement issued by the headquarters on the 15th, in addition to the British and American fleets and air force, many French rebel fleets also participated in the landing operation. Seven landings were made in the first two hours of the operation.</p>
<h3>The terrain along the southern coast of France is flat Fierce battle expected for Toulon</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram from Huitong News Agency: The new landing operation by the Anti-Axis forces on the southern coast of France was expected in advance, so it is not surprising. The German army had long detected the concentration of a large number of ships in the ports of central Italy and Corsica, and the transfer of the strong units of the US Fifth Army from the Arno front was also related to this operation. As for whether the enemy's new landing attempt will also be carried out in the Gulf of Genoa to echo the offensive in Italy, or whether it will begin to advance westward at the same time after landing in southern France, is still a question. However, the German command has countermeasures for this.</p>
<p>The Anti-Axis forces also adopted the same combat techniques as the Normandy landings, landing a large number of paratroopers in France. The Anti-Axis forces landed from the sea and air between Cannes and Toulon, cleverly avoiding the fortresses there. The coastline there is extremely flat, and the terrain west of Toulon and Marseille is wide and flat, leading north into the Rhone River basin. The enemy troops will sooner or later use tanks to try to enter the area, but they must first capture a large port as a base to be effective, so the great battle for the Toulon base will begin soon.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Cover Landing Operation</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) The Anti-Axis Air Force had been fiercely bombing military facilities and transportation routes on the southern coast of France for three days, especially the Marseille port area. Enemy aircraft dropped dummy bombs to divert the German army's attention. On the one hand, the Anti-Axis landing craft fleet moved from the ports on the west coast of Corsica Island. After German reconnaissance planes discovered the fleet, they immediately attacked. On the other hand, they reported to the German coastal guard. Therefore, when the Anti-Axis forces attempted to land near Prum, 30 kilometers east of Toulon port, late at night on the 14th, the German army had already prepared to intercept them. When the landing craft fleet approached the coast, the German coastal batteries opened fire and inflicted heavy damage. The landing infantry fell into the German defense positions and were almost completely annihilated. This landing attempt was only to contain or reconnoiter the German forces. After one or two hours of fierce fighting, by dawn on the 15th, the Anti-Axis forces were focusing on a 24-kilometer area between Saint-Vithil and Cape Kamenra, and were attempting to land everywhere between Toulon port and Nice port, either from the sea or with airborne troops, near Cape Anterpe, at Saint-Lelulou on the banks of the Agen River, at Cape Dramont, and at the Port of Yell west of Cape Saint-Tropez.</p>
<p>Coastal Batteries Exert Power</p>
<p>The Anti-Axis fleet bombarded the aforementioned coastal areas from its ships, especially the Saint-Raphael area. The enemy dropped about a battalion of paratroopers behind the German front line, but the unit was heavily bombarded by the German army and suffered heavy losses. Currently, Anti-Axis tanks have only successfully landed in the Saint-Tropez area, and the German defenses are exerting great power to stop the enemy's advance. In the minefield east of Saint-Lelulou, one enemy general and more than sixty soldiers have surrendered. The area between Nice port and Toulon port is shielded by Mount Montbaur and other branches of the Alps, with only a few kilometers of plains and hills up to about 600 feet high running east and west. The German army has built strong positions in these hilly areas, so the Anti-Axis landing attempt has not yet achieved the expected results.</p>
<p>In the areas north of Cape Anterpe, Saint-Lelulou, and Saint-Tropez Bay, the Anti-Axis forces have only gained strongholds and have not been able to establish contact, so they have not yet formed a single battle line. Although the landing forces are covered by fleets and air forces, they are far inferior to the Normandy landings on June 6. Although the Anti-Axis forces' losses have not yet been reported in detail, many enemy landing craft were destroyed by artillery fire off Cape Saint-Pier, and the paratroopers who landed at the mouth of the Agen River were almost completely annihilated. Within a few hours of the start of the landing operation, the Anti-Axis forces had suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Normandy Front Continues Encirclement Operations US Forces Repelled on South Bank of Loire River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram from German News Agency: The US 15th Army Group's assault troops and the Canadian First Army continued their encirclement operations south of Caen and north of Mont, attempting to shake the morale of the German army in Normandy. However, the German army fought bravely again in various areas of the front, resisting all the anti-Axis air raids and bombardments. This battle, like the war in Italy, proves that relying solely on material resources cannot create a final decision; the decision must rely on the soldiers' resistance and fighting spirit. The elite troops of the Canadian First Army advanced slowly in the Reis River basin, on the Caen-Falaise road, and east of the Aunay River, and paid a heavy price for the few kilometers of progress they made. The invading forces that assaulted Caen failed to achieve any significant victories. The center of gravity of the protruding part of the front south of Vire is still in the Troddemier area. The enemy attempted to break through the Vire-Dom front to hinder the German army's retreat, but was blocked by the German rear guard and German artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram: The German military authorities announced on the 15th that the German army on the northern French front had repelled the US reconnaissance forces that had invaded the south bank of the Loire River to the north bank after two days of fighting on the 14th and 15th. In addition, the US military has used a large number of French people to dig trenches to defend the Loire area.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Vistula River Bend German Troops Retake Raseiniai in the North</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram from Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army's current offensive is aimed at East Prussia, and the plan to invade the East Prussian border from the north, east, and southeast has begun. After ten days of fierce fighting, the Soviet army's plan to launch a large-scale offensive down the Neman River was temporarily abandoned due to heavy losses. The fighting between Kovno and Grodno on the west bank of the middle reaches of the Neman River has stopped on the Kalvarija-Suwałki line. Recently, the Soviet army launched an offensive northwest from Bialystok towards the Osowiec-Lek highway. Osowiec was an undefended area and fell into the hands of the Soviet army, and the German front line shifted westward by several kilometers. There is still fighting there. In the Baltic Sea region, the Soviet army deployed 20 infantry divisions and 4 tank divisions, attempting to break through into Estonia. Fierce fighting broke out in the areas southwest of Pskov where the Soviet army broke through, and as a result, the enemy army failed to expand its occupied areas. The third center of gravity of the war is in the Vistula River bend, and the great battle for the Baranow and Warka bridgeheads is continuing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegram from frontline sources: The German army on the Baltic Sea front retook Raseiniai in Lithuania on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Increased Grain Production in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>The supply of agricultural products in Shanxi Province has been very successful, due to the promotion of strong administrative power. This year, the agricultural products of Shanxi Province are mainly wheat. In the Hedong and Jinning Daos in the south of the province, wheat harvesting has ended, and the collection period is underway.</p>
<p>This year's Shanxi Province's increased production measures include the following:</p>
<p>Increased Production Measures</p>
<p>With the provincial, dao, and county administrative organs as the main body, the cooperative system is implemented under their strong planning and control.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with the control of the cultivation plan, is the strengthening of the key points of the increased production measures, giving the production stability and collecting political aspects, in order to ensure active increased production.</p>
<p>Everything is planned production. The key crops are wheat, rice, miscellaneous grains, cotton, potatoes, etc. The target of the cultivation area, the estimated harvest, and the amount of production for supply are made independent. Under the current state, the plan is thoroughly implemented, and the farmers in the province have a solid belief that they no longer hold the idea of ​​"it is difficult to buy May rice with money, and eating enough rice in June after continuous rain".</p>
<p>This year, the above-mentioned plan is followed. This year's supplies to be submitted include wheat, miscellaneous grains, rice (polished rice), cotton, potatoes, as well as edible oil and beans. Starting from the south of the province, all counties in the province have increased their confidence, generating absolute necessity for the required supply, ensuring production. Therefore, compulsory instructors are dispatched to develop new paddy fields, supplying funds and materials. Regarding wheat, miscellaneous grains, cotton, etc., seed disinfection, fertilization improvement, and irrigation facilities are enhanced. Furthermore, the cultivation area of potatoes is increased, in order to ensure absolute collection.</p>
<p>Rationing System</p>
<p>The economic policy of Shanxi Province is to use compulsory methods to maintain a unique low-price policy. From the perspective of the official price, it is quite different from other provinces in North China. The official price of last year's purchases was increased compared to the previous year. This year it remains unchanged, and the policy will be enforced. In view of the general rise in prices, it is inevitable to feel unreasonable. To remedy this, Shanxi Province has once again implemented a livelihood policy. That is, for general producers, a rationing system is established and implemented. This point has generated a very good feeling among producers. This rationing system has been going on for many years. After the household registration survey is completed, the rationing is even more spacious. For example, the monthly budget of the rationing system in Taiyuan City has been reduced considerably since this year, with a difference of hundreds of tons. For those engaged in important industries, ensuring the rationing amount is a matter of course, and the rationing amount is also ensured for general producers. Not only that, but also for general civil servants, the rationing is guaranteed. Recently, it has been very smooth in dealing with high prices. This year's Shanxi grain supply policy will be given a solid foundation.</p>
<p>The authorities have long declared that this year's purchase price will remain unchanged, because Shanxi's low-price policy depends on the low cost of agricultural product prices. If the official price is changed, of course, the general economy will be affected and must be considered at length. Shanxi maintains its low prices and exports to other provinces, and uses the difference to enable general producers to obtain materials. Considerable effects are exerted on agricultural and animal husbandry benefits. In order to ensure the production of five key crops, various researches and countermeasures are implemented within the possible scope. For a mountainous province like Shanxi, establishing a plan to ensure the production of rice this year, and overcoming extraordinary difficulties to complete it, is truly worth writing about. At least the Japanese army and Japanese people in Shanxi can be guaranteed not to lack the love of white rice, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>Transportation Problems</p>
<p>This year, the harvest of agricultural products in Shanxi Province is expected to be more than 30% higher than in previous years. The people live and work in peace and contentment, and engage in the decisive battle with full gratitude. However, the transportation problem that is prevalent in North China, especially during the grain harvest period, the problems of collection and transportation, must be considered. Shanxi Province has taken various countermeasures to resolve the difficulties. After the shortage of gasoline, a new scene has emerged. For example, last year, the freight cars of the national policy company were used to assist, and local vehicles and horses were used as the main body to implement rotation transportation. This year, the province has established a mobilization plan for the requisition of vehicles, horses and livestock. The requisition is based on the fixed price and provides food. At the same time, the province also encourages the old-fashioned transportation methods of Asia, that is, human power to carry and send. The general provincial people have been influenced by the wartime service concept, and a self-supply movement has occurred. During the period of collection and transportation, this consciousness is becoming more and more prosperous.</p>
<p>Since this year is a year of good harvest, the enemy bandits are also eager to move. The southern provincial border has become a place of fierce fighting. The local security team and police team have obtained the assistance of the Japanese army to implement security to ensure complete safety. The farmers also pledged to cooperate with the new regime. The counties in the south where the enemy bandits are active have achieved more than 100% success in the supply volume. Shanxi's grain war is again making a triumphant advance this year.

<h3>Moving more than one bag of flour requires permission Moving one bag or less is unrestricted</h3>
<p>The government's Prosperity Bureau, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, is strengthening control over rice and flour, and severely cracking down on hoarding and speculation. Therefore, the regulations for cracking down on movement methods are extremely detailed. It is now learned that there are still some citizens who do not understand the rules for moving flour. There are countless cases of citizens carrying flour on their shoulders and being confiscated by the Prosperity Bureau. According to inquiries made by a Central News Agency reporter to the relevant authorities, any flour that is more than one bag must not be moved without applying for permission from the主管富局. Flour within one bag is unrestricted, and it is hoped that citizens will pay attention and cooperate with the government in implementing control policies.</p>
<p>Those applying to move materials should handle the application themselves</p>
<p>The Commercial Coordination Association (商統會) handles the movement of materials and has a permit affairs office specifically for issuing permits. For the past year, the handling has been relatively smooth. Starting from August this year, the Commercial Coordination Association was reorganized, and the permit affairs office was placed under the jurisdiction of the management office. After strengthening the internal organization, applications for material relocation are processed quickly and fairly, and no backlog is allowed. Anyone who goes to apply will be reviewed and given a permit according to a certain procedure. Recently, it has been heard that applicants often entrust a third party to handle the application procedures, hoping to obtain a permit in advance, and the third party then takes the opportunity to advertise everywhere and undertakes to handle the application, causing applicants to be unaware of the true situation and be deceived. In order to eliminate this malpractice, the Commercial Coordination Association has strictly ordered the staff in the receiving and dispatching department to pay close attention, and to handle the application forms as soon as they arrive without any backlog. At the same time, it is hoped that applicants will go to the permit office at the Jiangxi Road Hamilton Building in person to handle the various procedures, and not be fooled by third parties again, resulting in losses.</p>
<h3>Next Period Household Rice Scheduled for Distribution on the 20th Still Two Sheng Per Person, Same Price</h3>
<p>Since the household rice in this city resumed distribution on the 10th of this month, the quantity has not decreased, and the rice quality is very white. The citizens have expressed their gratitude. However, the period of ten days will soon expire. When will the next period of rice distribution begin, and will there be any changes in the quantity and price? The general public is very concerned. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited Mr. Feng, the director of the City Goods Distribution Office, who stated that the household rice in this city had been suspended for several periods due to unclear sources, and the general public had been complaining bitterly. Mayor Chen was also very worried about this. After several consultations with the Allied authorities, a large number of supplies have been obtained, so in the first ten days of this month, the city's household rice can continue to be distributed, and the quantity has not decreased, and the rice quality is very good, which is very gratifying. In the future, the household rice for each period can be distributed according to the scheduled plan, and there is no risk of being late. Regarding this point, Mayor Chen had already made a statement in the newspaper at the beginning of this month, which need not be repeated. The next period of household rice in this city is scheduled to be distributed on the 20th of this month, still at two Sheng per person, and the price is the same as the previous period.</p>

It is now learned that the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is paying close attention to this. In addition to ordering the former No. 1 District Finance Office of the city government to conduct a thorough investigation, it has also sent personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If it is verified that there is indeed embezzlement, the embezzling personnel will be severely punished according to law.</p>

<h3>Forged Cloth Purchase Certificates Discovered</h3>
<p>According to a responsible person at the United Wholesale Business Office of Cloth Shops, on the morning of July 26th, three customers went to the Lao Xie Da Xiang shop (registered number 590), a retailer on Ningxia Road, with cloth purchase certificates to buy cloth. Upon detailed inspection by the shop, it was discovered that the purchase certificates were forged. The shop immediately turned the people using the forged certificates over to the Taishan Road Police Station, along with the forged certificates. It is reported that the bureau is investigating the matter strictly, and all those involved have been dealt with according to the law. After the incident, the shop reported the situation to the office, and this office, in addition to dispatching personnel to investigate, immediately reported the incident to the Commercial Control Committee and the Economic Bureau for their record. It has been found that these forged certificates are quite easy to distinguish. On the front of the genuine certificates, the character "配" (allocation) has the radical "巳" (snake) on its right, while the forged certificates have the radical "己" (oneself). The strokes of the three characters "購布證" (cloth purchase certificate) on the genuine certificates are even, while the strokes of the two characters "布證" (cloth certificate) on the forged certificates are thinner and uneven. The background pattern color of the genuine certificates is not very bright, while the yellow color of the forged certificates is particularly bright. It is hoped that citizens will not seek petty profits by reselling the cloth purchase certificates they receive and be deceived. It is also hoped that all participating merchants will pay attention to detailed inspections to maintain the distribution policy.</p>

<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Innocent Pleas! Pure Begging! A Letter from a Failed Student</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the list of elementary and middle school students approved for scholarships, we have continuously received letters from many failed students, all fully expressing innocent pleas and showing pure begging. The terms "pleas" and "begging" used here, thoroughly speaking, are absolutely different from the hypocritical regrets on obituaries of fashionable people, or the extended hands of young displaced people begging for money. One side is hypocritical and technical, while the other is innocent and pure. We are also salaried workers, and our children are also qualified to be assisted. Therefore, after reading these kinds of letters, and thinking of the picture in the official residence, we can't help but feel deep sympathy. There are really no flowery words to express it, enough to induce powerful people in society to each launch a thought of kindness, donate scholarship money, so that every failed student can complete their continuing education goals. Here is an excerpt from a letter from a second-year middle school student, whose situation is relatively common. He said: "I am a student who participated in the Shenbao Scholarship Examination. Since the day of the exam, not a day has passed without flipping through the Shenbao, hoping to be on the list and receive a subsidy. But the day before yesterday (August 10th) morning, when I opened the newspaper and saw the list published, I searched and searched, but I couldn't find my name. This made me extremely sad. I believe it must be because my grades were not good enough that I failed. I don't blame my family for not hiring servants, which made me spend the summer helping my mother with chores all day long, and tutoring my younger brother, which exhausted me and left me with no time and energy to review my own lessons, so that she could make progress. I also don't blame my family's weak financial resources, which made me have to wholeheartedly hope to obtain a scholarship. I only blame myself for being mediocre in talent, so that I failed. But thinking that my father is already overwhelmed for the sake of the family's livelihood, often calculating the family's income and expenditure alone, like a neurotic, and my mother works from early morning to night, bending over and losing her human form, I don't want to add another huge burden to them. Therefore, since I don't have a scholarship, I have to stop studying. Although my father said to me, 'Don't worry, let me think of a way.' But I know very well that after seven or eight years of difficult struggles, my father has nothing left. Even the three to five hundred yuan needed to obtain household registration rationed goods often makes it difficult to find a source of funding. How can he still have the ability to borrow three or four thousand yuan for me to continue my studies? These words of his are nothing more than comforting me in a helpless situation, comforting himself. My father has been ambitious all his life, so I dare not let him know that I am writing this letter begging you, but based on the following points, I beg you to consider whether you can still give me a rescue method to avoid me dropping out of school, because dropping out of school will make me illiterate, which is equivalent to becoming disabled.</p>
<p>My father is a pure salaried worker, not only "poor," but indeed has reached a state of "poverty with no place to stand."</p>
<p>I am usually very diligent in studying. My grades are not as good as others, not because I am unwilling to work hard, but because I have to share part of the family's work, and the opportunity to study on my own is too little.</p>
<p>I desperately hope to continue my studies and increase my intellectual nourishment. Sir, if a hungry and thirsty dying person is as eager to obtain food and water, more so than on the meaning of human mutual assistance, more so than on my aspiration to study eagerly, in the name of God's benevolence, please, no matter what, give me a share, to avoid me dropping out of school, to avoid me being blind and riding a blind horse, in this world that is extremely easy for humans to be eliminated, becoming a disabled person, becoming an eliminated person. Sir, as I write this, I feel extremely sad and ashamed. I am crying, sir. I believe that if you see my environment and my pitiful and sympathetic situation, you will definitely sympathize with me and help me within your possible scope.</p>
<p>Please pity my anxious emotions, take time out of your busy schedule, and give me a reply, because if I don't expect to receive your reply, I will definitely be so sad that I will go crazy at all times."</p>
<p>Comfort to Some of the Failed Students</p>
<p>There were more than 3,000 students who failed to be admitted after this year's screening. We have said that most of these 3,000 students have excellent grades. The reason for not giving subsidies even though they should be subsidized is because the amount of scholarship money is insufficient for distribution, so we can only help as much as we can. However, we still hold a glimmer of hope, earnestly hoping that all readers, especially wealthy merchants and influential people, will generously donate funds. In these two sentences, helping one more person with the line will help one more person. Fortunately, in the past ten days, we have received generous donations from all walks of life. The day before yesterday, Mr. Lu Chuseng donated a huge sum of one to two million yuan. We have decided to increase the subsidy for the elementary school group by 200 people, the middle school group by 350 people, the high school group by 250 people, and the university and vocational school group by 200 people, for a total of 1,000 people. This can be a comfort to some of the failed students. We are truly grateful for Mr. Lu's enthusiasm, which saved 1,000 students from dropping out of school and comforted the anxiety of 1,000 students and their families. It is truly a boundless merit. At the same time, we hope that influential people will continue to work hard and rely on donations. There are still 2,000 students waiting!</p>

<h3>The Tuition Fee Problem at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>— Fa Jun</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that "The national famous schools in Beijing have determined the amount of fees: National Central University 800 yuan." After reading it, I deeply feel that the government's measures are reasonable.</p>
<p>Because national strength must have a large number of talents. A country without talents will inevitably become a dependency of other countries. However, the growth of talents must rely on educational cultivation. Therefore, the quality of education determines the strength of a country, and it can also be said that it determines whether a country can survive in this world of elimination. Therefore, all countries in the world attach extreme importance to education. Now the tuition fee of Central University is 800 yuan, which in today's high prices can indeed absorb a large number of students, and then select from them those with genius and ability to be made into the talents that the country hopes for, and give them the education they need. Only then can there be a day when talents emerge in large numbers and the level of civilization is improved. This is the way to move towards the path of revitalization.</p>
<p>Looking back at the National Jiaotong University in Shanghai, I can't help but feel disheartened. The school has announced that the tuition fee is 5,000 yuan per student, which is more than six times that of Central University. It is really incomprehensible. If it is said that the prices in Beijing and Shanghai are different, then the difference is at most several percent, definitely not one time, let alone six times. This is one. If it is said that the country does not need the talents trained by Jiaotong University, then I am studying in the School of Engineering, so let me briefly describe the engineering aspects.</p>
<p>Let us try to grind clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all supplies, which one does not need industrial manufacturing or processing? For example, rice must be ground by electric power, and extra rice must be placed in a steel refined rice pot made by the aluminum industry, and cooked with machine-made briquettes. The rest can be seen. As for modern warfare, it is entirely a war of industry. Airplanes, cannons, tanks, and warships are all products of industry. In short, industry really dominates our lives, and industry is the element that determines everything. Looking around at domestic engineering schools, they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Moreover, Jiaotong University has a long history, and possesses a large number of valuable experimental instruments, records, and teaching materials. Although the equipment is inferior to that before the war, it is still unmatched by other schools. The importance of industry is so great, and the situation of Jiaotong University is also so great. Therefore, the country must demand the talents of Jiaotong University. This is two. Or it is said that Jiaotong University is larger in scale, the cost is too high, and the government is unable to bear it. However, the current Jiaotong University is much smaller than before the war. The scale cannot be said to be large. There are only five or six hundred students, which is far behind Datong, St. John's, etc. It is hard to know where to start when the government of a great power cannot afford a school of several hundred people. Moreover, the government's income includes consumption special tax, customs duties, tobacco and alcohol stamp tax, and unified tax, etc., Shanghai undoubtedly accounts for the largest percentage of the country. Then there is more to be gained here, and more to be used here, which is not only not excessive, but also a matter of course. This is three.</p>
<p>Apart from these three items, there is no other reason to say. Therefore, it is puzzling and suspected that the school's move, the education authorities may not know, or have not yet approved it, or it is a mistaken approval. In short, with the example of Central University, this kind of contradictory and unreasonable move makes us dare not believe that it is the act of the wise education authorities. However, the education authorities have the right to make reasonable adjustments and reductions, and on the one hand, appropriately increase funding. This is the most appropriate, most ideal, and most praiseworthy measure at present.</p>
<p>As for the consequences of the increased income, they will inevitably be unthinkable. Because Jiaotong University students are different from other schools, most of them are poor. Because in the past there was no scholarship, the poor studied desperately and were admitted because the cost was cheap. Because if it is not Jiaotong University, they will not be able to afford to drop out of school. Each session of candidates is more than any other school. Therefore, the few admitted students are the most outstanding talents in the country. Therefore, they are all plainly dressed and study diligently. It is not without reason that it is noticed and valued at home and abroad. Now, in a shout, the cost is raised to five hundred times. The number is not much for the rich. But it is too much for Jiaotong University students. Most of those who cannot raise funds will live in.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwade Yu, Translated into Western Language</p>
<p>Regarding such words, Ryuo also heard them from his mother. Initially, his mother opposed her son's interest in naval affairs, so no matter how good Shin Jin was, she always expressed hesitation about the marriage.</p>
<p>"That's Technician Shin Jin, there's no way."</p>
<p>"It's Ryuo's sister, Eda, who likes Shin Jin!"</p>
<p>Ryuo was even more surprised. When he ran away from home, didn't his sister hate Shin Jin? Before that, when Shin Jin entered the military academy, didn't they argue in front of the train window?</p>
<p>"Then, when did she start loving him?"</p>
<p>Ryuo felt very strange and asked this question.</p>
<p>"Although I don't know very well, your father said it might be when Eda and Shin Jin were on the warship—it was last October—it started from that time."</p>
<p>In short, Eda's appearance has changed. So, she suddenly stopped mentioning things she hated before, like living in Kagoshima, wanting to go to Tokyo to study Western tailoring, or entering a women's university, and she wanted to be a country woman.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Eda loves Shin Jin."</p>
<p>"That's what a woman should understand herself..."</p>
<p>The mother suddenly smiled, but then said solemnly:</p>
<p>"Eda has liked Shin Jin since she was little!"</p>
<p>"No, it's not like that. She hasn't liked Shin Jin since she was little."</p>
<p>"Then that's not right, is it? A woman's heart will not love someone she hates—she loves those she likes, and doesn't love those she doesn't like..."</p>
<p>When it came to this subtle relationship, even the brain of a naval painter could not explain it, but when he suddenly thought of his own feelings for the "Navy," he understood a woman's heart, just like a man's.</p>
<p>In any case, Ryuo absolutely approves of this marriage and always hopes to resolve this matter as soon as possible. For the sake of caution, the parents wanted to talk to the Tani family's parents before seeking Shin Jin's consent, but Ryuo volunteered to negotiate directly with Shin Jin.</p>
<p>"Okay, when I return to Tokyo, I will pass by Kure Town, meet with Shin Jin, and talk..."</p>
<p>But he was very afraid that his sister was joking. If it was really a joke, then he would really be sorry to Shin Jin. But Eda had already understood the situation by observing his expression, so she was very nervous. Whenever the brother and sister met alone, she always ran away. After much effort, when he seized an opportunity, Ryuo said:</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm going to meet Shin Jin in Kure Town, do you have any opinion?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>Seeming not to want to talk about it, she immediately escaped Ryuo's sight. (132)</p>
<p>Changshu District Certificate Renewal: General Joint Security Office Expresses Opinions</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Changshu Baojia District General Joint Security Office sent a letter yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>"To the Editors: We have just read the article published in the National Forum on August 12 regarding the issue of improving the performance of replacing residence permits in our district. After reading it, we were extremely surprised. Since our district was ordered to start replacing residence permits, we have repeatedly discussed appropriate procedures with the police authorities in our district. At the same time, we have repeatedly and sincerely told the directly affiliated Baojia personnel to strive for simplification in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people. For example, the application form should have been purchased by the applicant, but for the convenience of the residents, we obtained the consent of the police authorities in our district to have the Lianbao chiefs or Bao chiefs pay for the application forms and distribute them to the Baojia chiefs for distribution to each household to fill out themselves. Moreover, when residents go to the police station to replace their permits during the summer, they will inevitably be dizzy under the scorching sun. In view of this, our district, with the donation of Lianbao Chief Tian Yao, built a shed to avoid the heat. Drinks are provided for residents who are thirsty. Is this kind of arrangement harmful to the residents?</p>
<p>As for the applicant adding their name stamp on the application, this is a regulation of the superiors. There is a 'stamp' printed on the right side of the applicant's name on the application form. In order to facilitate residents without stamps in our district, those with stamps can use them, and those without stamps are exempt. Regarding the photo, two photos with the same appearance are sufficient. However, some residents use a mixture of old and new photos, or use photos that have been peeled off and re-pasted, some use color photos, some do not comply with the required two-and-a-half-inch bust, and some take photos with two people together and cut them out and paste them. Anyone who has doubts about the above facts can check with the Baojia section of the Changshu Road Branch Bureau, which will be clear at a glance. As for the so-called difficulties and the pain of running errands, etc., the application form is filled out by the applicant and submitted to the household head and Jia chief for stamping and guarantee, and then sent to the Bao chief's office for checking the name and age before going to the branch bureau Baojia office to replace it. How can the Baojia office create difficulties? The most difficult thing to understand is the adherence to formalities. After the application form is filled out and stamped, must it be submitted to the Baojia office for application, or are there other formalities in the official documents?</p>
<p>Our district has always taken fairness and benefit to the people as its primary responsibility, and the Changshu Road police authorities are also like this. Therefore, although the institutions belong to two branches, the goals are completely the same. Although Mr. Hong's article cannot be said to be unfounded, it is obviously inconsistent with the past situation. This matter concerns the reputation of the entire Baojia district and the impression of all residents in the district, so we have to list the facts and send a letter for your review and ask your newspaper to disclose it to set the record straight. However, our district has a vast territory, and it is inevitable that some unscrupulous individuals will act on their own. We still hope that Mr. Hong will, based on the facts, use a written letter or come in person to our district office at 600 Jiashan Road to report secretly so that we can verify and handle the matter. This is what we expect. Sincerely, Changshu Baojia District General Joint Security Office."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Buddhist Congee Factory: Corn Flour Allocated to Charity Groups; Register with This Office Within Three Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Congee Factory, due to the sharp rise in rice prices in the city, which has had the most severe impact on the poor, has successively purchased a total of 114 dan and 85 jin of corn flour in preparation for distribution to the poor in winter. Now, after a meeting of the standing board of directors, it has been decided to distribute it in advance and allocate the full amount to various charitable organizations in the city, such as disabled homes, nursing homes, old-age homes, congee factories, and Buddhist halls. If the above-mentioned institutions lack food and need to supplement it with this corn flour, please register with this office within three days, stating the number of people and detailed information, in order to allocate and distribute it.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Person: Commendable Enthusiasm</h3>

Both of these people do not want to reveal their real names, and their enthusiasm for public welfare is truly admirable. Others, such as the Muer Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, which sold Sislong tablets for charity and donated 10,600 yuan, Mr. Chen, 2,000 yuan, and the Ji Ren Zhi You Tang, 1,000 yuan, either to relieve the poor and sick or to donate to orphans.
