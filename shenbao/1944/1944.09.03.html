<h3>星期評論第七次諮詢會議觀感</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>九月一日，市政諮詢委員會舉行第七次全體委員會議，這次會議的中心議題，是討論警察及保安隊待遇的調整問題。紀錄已見今日各報。茲就本人出席會議的觀感，抒述如次：</p>
<p>第一，警察及保安隊的待遇，需要合理調整，諮詢委員的意見，在原則上完全一致，共同認為是必要之舉。惟對待遇調整以後，所需龐大的經費，取給於增加市民納稅的一點，諮詢委員中有兩秤意見，一種主張由四釐零售捐，增至六釐，以所增之雨釐，指定專作調整待遇之用。一種則主張不必加稅，或增加一釐面整頓舊稅，不增加市民負擔</p>
<p>我認為目前最重要的是治安問題，維護治安的重要性與共必要性，以及警察與保安隊的職務與治安的關聯性，本報社評對於這方面的闈釋，一年以來論列不輟。而欲期警察與保安隊克盡維護治安的重任，決非目前不够生話的待遇條件下，所能完成的。換言之，不增加經費，調整警察保安隊待遇，而欲確立治安，簡直是空談，不會有實效的。對於這一問題，現在已經弘起各界的注意而認為必要，這是値得欣幸的。</p>
<p>我更認為增加治安經費，達到合理調整警保待遇的地步，其數目相當龐大，消極的整理舊稅，恐嫌不够。當然，整理舊稅是目前財政上的重要工作，亟應統籌實施。可是，依此為洽安經費，是否足够是成問題的。旣然決定調整待遇，就要澈澈底底的滿足每個人的最低要求。所以，我不贊成輕稅主義，結果半痛半癢，一事無成。</p>
<p>增加捐稅，不必考慮的，也不必害怕的，而必須考慮的却是增稅的目的，是否正當？用途是否必要？稅率是否適當？考慮的結果，決定增稅與否。其次，害怕的却是稅款的徵收保管與動用是否合理。簡言之，只要取之於民，用之於民，則增稅無妨。况且，現在市民在納稅以外，在其他名義上另外支出的錢並不為少，何勿爽爽快快，平均普遍的增些稅。市民不要怕納稅，只要防範走漏與中飽</p>
<p>總之，增稅與整稅而這，並不成相反的問題，而問題只在於孰者能够澈底完成目的。現在調整警保待遇原則通過，希望　警保當局趕速編造最合理最理想的預算。　市政當局考慮決定從速實施。　中央財政當局及盟邦關係當局切實協助。　以後徵稅必須普遍，不論中外任何國籍的居民一律納稅。</p>
<p>第三，物品配給處長在會議席上報告，公私立學校敎職員，給予特種配給，與公務員同樣待遇，即可實施。當局體恤敎育工作人員的至意，値得提出感謝的。</p>
<p>第三，關於這次特稅舞弊案件，亦有談及。正在偵查中，由警察司法特高各有關部門協力辦理。當局表示以很大決心，秉公處理。傳聞外間不無批評諮詢會對於米糧問題，頗多建議於批評，而特稅舞弊案件却少批評，其實這是不無誤解的，因爲特稅舞弊案件，市當局已經表示決心整飭，且正在實施澈查，此與米糧問題有所不同，不能混為一談。</p>
<p>其次，特稅舞弊案件，公務人員集團作弊固然犯法，而一部份商人企圖逃稅亦屬違法，串同作弊者尤屬違法。今後市府固應整頓稅收，而工商界市民亦須自肅。希望市商會領導司業公會提倡「不避稅運動」，勸吿會員遵守納稅義務，不逃避應納捐稅，使稅收充實一市政上軌道，則全體市民交受其益</p>
<h3>日首相在官邸　邀重臣懇談　米內藤原兩相亦參加</h3>

<h3>小笠原羣島空襲　擊落敵機十一架　父日軍迎擊來攻敵艦艇</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，小笠原羣島方面，上月三十一日下午，曾有彷彿來自敵機動部隊之艦上機羣來襲，計襲父島者約四十架，　每島者約七架，襲硫黃島者累計約四十架，日軍迎擊結果，父島方面擊落三架，硫黃島方購擊落四架，翌晨父島又迭有敵艦上機來襲，累計約百架，母島亦然，累計約百數十架，午前更有敵艦艇自海上向父島砲擊，該方購日軍奮勇迎擊，迄今判明父島方面擊落四架，硫黃島方面擊落七架。</p>

<h3>日機進攻　渝美空軍基地　重創柳州丹竹機塲</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地二日中央社電日軍夜間轟炸機隊，一日拂曉，冒惡劣之天氣，進攻渝美空軍基地柳州及丹竹，收得極大戰果，茲誌詳情如次：最近渝美空軍，賴電波探知器之設施，對日軍基地頻行攻學，日軍對此亦時作有效之尾追攻擊。三十一日夜，敵機復對日軍施以波狀攻擊，日軍夜間轟炸機隊，待其投彈後，行將逃遁時，即起而追踪，進行攻擊。柳州氣候雖極惡劣，然日機終能進入目標上空，渝美空軍判明日機來襲，戰鬭機邃起而迎戰，日機即於此際，使用巧妙戰術，投下必中彈，其大型機三架中彈起火，又大型機二架，小型機二架，已證實被擊毀。此外空襲丹竹方面之日機，於苦鬥之後，亦突入柳州上空，冒猛烈之防空砲火，投下必中彈，有小型機二架中彈起火，其他地上設施三處被擊毀且起火，日機則安然歸返。</p>

<h3>宜昌週圍激烈戰况</h3>
<p>里斯本中央社電據美聯社重慶訊，湖南戰局如次：渝軍爲阻止日軍向湖南戰綫增援，而於宜昌周闡發動攻勢，已歷三週，然一無所得。渝軍以現在之兵力及裝備，欲岡奪回宜昌實不可能，若謂藉此阻上日軍尙可。目前日軍正攻擊衡陽西南方，按該方面有渝軍最精銳二師，集於湘桂鐵路兩側。查日軍目的，在排除日軍對衡陽之阻礙力。渝軍當局於卅一日發表公報，曾謂軍刻正進攻衡陽西南方云云。湖北省宜昌東北八公里至十公里之戰綫，係渝軍之反攻戰綫，而日軍則由宜昌增援，故雙方刻正激戰中。又於常陽發動反攻之日軍，獲地援軍後，戰事趨於激烈，廿九日曾激戰終日。</p>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　據重慶電，有力日軍頃正於衛陽西方準備進攻，故實慶附近，或將展開一大激戰。據由衛陽歸來之外國人談，日軍在衡陽西方一公里之處，構築堅固陣地，以猛烈砲火轟擊渝軍。渝軍亦再三反攻，然因砲火不足，未能鎭壓日軍，而日軍且自衡陽西方積極整理陣勢，不久或於實慶左近演成一大激戰。</p>
<p>日軍某基地二日中央社電日軍自八月十二日開始作戰後，旋即佔領麗水，截至八月二十日止，所獲戰果，計渝軍遺屍六九零具被俘六九八名。又函獲渝軍重機槍七挺，柏擊砲三門，日軍僅陣亡四十五名云。</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍　會師龍陵</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫二日中央社電　渝軍刻仍對拉孟，騰越級龍陵作執拗之攻擊，但因接濟困難，旦迭遭日軍之奮擊，致銳氣大减。再日軍南方部隊正由滇緬公路方面開始攻勢，一部兵力已集合芒市附近，另外一支出南方向龍陵前進，上月二十七日突破渝軍包圍網，到達龍陵城內，與城內日守軍會師，開始向龍陵東方及東北方進攻，戰况頗爲順利。</p>

<h3>孔祥熙在美　訂購布協定</h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　渝方七月曾派行政院副院長兼財政部長孔祥熙，渡美出席所謂國際通貨會議。二十九日延安新華通訊社，曾攻擊謂，此次孔祥照赴美唯一之重（大任務，係由美國每月向重慶輸入洋布二千噸，但此全爲一部政府要人一種發財手段而已。茲誌共大意如次：謂孔祥熙最近於美國成立每月輸入二千噸洋布之協定，一噸洋布相當於二百萬疋，故每月可輸四十萬疋，一疋洋布於美國僅為美金七元。自美國由海路運至加爾各答，再由該地以飛機運至重慶，其運費最高一疋約合美金五元，連原價為十二元美金，合法幣爲四百八十元。然現在洋布一疋已値三萬六百元，因此一疋可獲利三萬一百二士元每月四十萬疋，約一百二十萬萬元，一年則有千四百四十萬萬元之利益。中間派對政府此種行為，表示不滿者甚夥。現在內地非無洋布，實際全被囤價，因民衆無資購買，故此種大量輸入，僅不過為數要人之買辦，及各種投機商之一稱賺錢機會而已。一方中國之紡織業又將蒙嚴重打擊，對民衆則毫無裨益云。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　德空軍當局三十一日就德軍對美軍「超空要塞」B29型轟炸機之防禦方法加以說明，謂日機隊於美空軍B29型機首次空襲日本，日方是役獲致偉大戰果後，對於該機之弱點，與技術上之缺陷，均洞悉無遺，今德軍根據日方　敵B29型機之研究結果，已有精密之防禦準備，故今後敵B29型機如出現於歐洲戰域時，德軍常能以萬全之措置，予以　擊。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　據此間軍事專家語記者，敵美以B29型機為主體之空軍，出現於東亞戰綫以來，業將二月有半，雖云旣無成果，且時遭日軍擊落，然敵方竟藉此行動大事宣傳，欲使對日攻勢急速進展，短期決戰具體買現，吾人如稍將敵空軍戰略實體及其動向加以檢討，其中實有不少弱點及脆弱部面，尤其値得指述者，則為敵空軍之　略，距離完成敵美意圖仍須相當時間。B29型機係以「能飛行長距離」，「能裝載重量炸彈，「能作極高度飛行」，「速度快，「防禦力强」五點為目標而設計者，如就表面各點加以檢討，似為「基於學理經騐之科學和器」，然以此為空軍戰略活動之主體，則脆弱之點殊多。就防禦力方面觀之，其脆弱點已行畢露，上月二十日敵機空襲北九州時，八十架之中，確實遭日軍擊落二十三架，其他未能證實者，則在十架以上，又其他蒙受損害者，亦在二十架以上。單就以上各點觀之，敵B29型機之脆弱性，已甚明顯，蓋機體龐大，自然易成為攻擊之目標，同時，大型轟炸機以飛行速度快，於是命中攻　工目標乃較爲困難，正如日軍航空隊勇士所言，「機體之裝甲雖厚，然一經命中弱點，則即刻制其死命一，其次敵美所自誇B29型機之最高高度轟炸，迄今尙未見其實行。敵機於空製日本本土時，飛行之高度多為四五千米至二千米，不僅易受戰鬥機之攻擊，甚或尙未脫離高射砲射程，至於攻擊力方面，則B29型機所謂對工塲，鐵路，港灣之精密轟炸，事實上並未收得若河成果，於此共弱點亦甚顯明。又為求長距離航行，其誇稱裝載之軍量，自然亦有限度，以此有限之炸彈，圖作精密之轟炸，自然其成果當如此困難。關於B29型機基地羣問題，須由其性能考察之，因其貝有長距離飛行性能，故可設立基地於距轟目標較遠之處，以免受日機威脅，但如此則因飛行距離過遠，其炸彈載裝量隨之極受限制，且後方基地亦未必安全，亦有不斷遭日機攻擊之可能。其次因B29型機隊具有特性之機動力，要能自由選擇基地，換言之，基地滑走路最短須在三至四公里以上，且一地僅能容納二十架之多，此種地上組織之完成，須得莫大之努力與時日。因上述各項困難，戰略空軍之仃動，乃極受限制，例如企圖實日水本土及中購塞班之轟炸戰術所以未能實現者，即因基地建設困難，故B29型機之行動，迄米得自由，事實上寒班地方實難設立B29型　之滑走路三至五條以上，即使其基地完全，亦需設置附近防禦設施。又B29型機不僅需要大量汽油，需要其他消耗修理用之機械零件亦頗多，其搭乘員每架需要十二名，倘擊落三十架，則有三百六十名走人地獄。B29型機所需乘員，復不能利用技術惡劣者，此即B29型機基地補給之困難及自體之脆弱之點。關於B29型機之生產量，本年六月以來，每月生產三百架，至本年十月預定可完成兩千架，假使完成兩千架，但第一綫僅能動員至一千架，再就其困難之點而觀，一千架飛機實無何威力，何况　落奉甚大，故其距離成功尙遠也。</p>

<h3>關員舞弊　歡迎據實檢舉　江海關海關長發表談話</h3>
<p>本月一日木埠英文泰晤士報揭載，署名S·K·LM者，向財政常局告發，陳述關員無弊之信件，記者於昨（二）日上午訪間海關長黑澤二郎氏，叩詢此事，承黑澤氏親自延見，發表談話如左：</p>
<h3>希望能得事實真相</h3>
<p>關於昨日泰晤士報所載信件之事，木人亦曾接到同樣信件，其內容與報上所載完全相同，惟本人收到信件上之署名為「愛國者」，與報上所載S·K·LM不同，至於該信陳述之內容，依照本人意見，其中不是完全事實，且大半過分虛染，於事實者不相符，海關當局希望得到事實眞相，以　核辦。對於一般流言，雖亦重視，但因不能求得確切事實，於實際很少裨益。關於信上最後二段所述海關南頭支所，及蘇州河東支所二處揀弊案件，海關當局事後並無處分一點，本人負責完全否認。查本人接到該二所舞弊之報告後，對該兩方面有過失人員，立即採取最嚴厲之處分，被處分者人數甚多，重者撤職，其次予以適當處罰。總之，本人對於瀆職人員，祗要根據，事實決不姑息，以上不過舉一例說明而已。</p>
<h3>各界協力整肅紀綱</h3>
<p>對於關員在外恐有不規則之事，曾委託木人熟悉之日木忠實商家數家，遇有不端非以勒索等情，直接報吿本人，予以最嚴厲之處分，但迄今並未接到報吿。關於信上所述，扣留貨物，並不給予憑這一點，本人曾於八月二十九日頒發第一七二七號布吿，及第四五八八號論各一件，使一般商民對於貨物被扣，務須領取扣押貨物憑單，同時剴切嘵　關員，於扣押貨物後，　予　給　單，且領取憑單為商民應有之　利，盼各界切勿自予放棄。對於種種外界流言，頗　證實，海關當局當盡最大勞力，整肅紀網，同時須　各界多多協力。　根據事實檢舉報告</p>
<p>倘祗說閒話而不直接幫助，於事實無補，本人希望S·K·LM君，如僞正是「愛國者」，則當不怕當面負責向本人報告，信中所說這舞弊案真相，如僅用匿名信向各方告發，因無直接原告，且所說之點過甚，海關當局不能加以接受。總之寫此信者，不論善意或是惡意，其不負責任為事實。又據寫信者佔計。現在關稅因舞弊而損失每月達一萬萬至一萬五千萬元之間，既然估計得這樣精確之數字，決不是偶然可以獲得，鴛何不當面報吿給本人，或謂吿發人因恐本人危險，故不敢負責出面報吿，則余敢保證，凡告發者絕對不用恐　，海關當局決不會將告發者之眞姓名宣佈，且舞弊者最怕被人揭穿，亦決不容其有報復行為，吿發者可無須麼怕。總之”海關當局對於整頓稅收行政，一方面須本身努力，一方面須請各界多予協助，凡根據事實檢舉關員舞弊之報告者，本人當予歡迎，並感謝其協助。</p>

<h3>軍陸的海新銳發動艇　試乘記</h3>
<p>某日清晨，陸軍船舶部隊的新銳大發動艇集結於東京　某港，成風凜凜，陣容堂堂，這還是第一次哩！發動機的隆隆聲傳遍了晨曦下的靜悄悄的港。未幾，指揮官「發航」的號令一下，記者所搭的先頭艇便一路向大海破浪疾駛。各艇魚貫地相繼出發，長驅向第二個港口前進。一陣陣的熱風這時已變成涼風，拂過胸襟，涼爽無比。回首一望，艇已駛出防波堤，出發港已隱沒於望煙之中。發動艇宛如兩隻小船合成，船首蹴著碧波，疾如天馬行空，白浪向兩側分開。三號·四號·五號……美麗的天青色的艇隊，排成一列縱隊，最後一艘遠在視界之外。這支陸軍船舶，部隊蜿蜓游上，堂堂進軍。</p>
<p>艇長岩城少尉緊閉著嘴，握著雙眼望遠鏡，凝視前方。船首艇尾聲各有二名士兵在警戒前，允受海上鍛鍊的舵手，用鐵一般的腕臂掌著舵。自艇長以下，都是曾在新幾內亞沿岸作戰的勇士，其中有些還嘗過魚雷的味道，或打沈過敵方潛水艇的哩。</p>
<p>本來是陸軍部隊，現在卻活躍海洋上了。「什麽？以前是不慣呀！從今以後看我們的吧！」</p>
<p>艇長雖然沒作聲，可也充滿了鬥志與信，大自有「幹了瞧罷」的樣子。</p>
<p>裝有機關砲，速射砲，高射，砲重機關槍等製飛機的研究同步並進，簡直不必用鐵，在高度的造船技術下，用膠合板造成，但強靭性不亞於鋼鐵。它可以裝載大的坦克車，運輸敵前上陸兵員，以很快的速力駛行。這種發達艇，製造材料既豐富，工程所需時日又少，實在是超戰時型呢！</p>
<p>啊，假想敵機！開始在頭上盤旋了。看到艇隊了嗎？艇上的士兵立刻迅速動作，各艇的砲口一齊朝天，發出一連呂的砲彈，宛如急　。假想敵機便倉皇遁走。</p>
<p>兩次，三次，艇隊重復著劇烈的訓練，終於駛抵豫定的目的港。</p>
<p>記者參觀了這種陸軍新銳發動艇所演習的海洋陣地戰，敵前上陸戰以及通信運輸等種種活動，對於在海上作戰的陸軍精銳，欽佩之至。試乘完了，當即敬祝他們健門，作別而歸。（譯自八月十六日　賣報知）</p>
<h3>德國電波戰術</h3>
<p>電波戰術，爲現代謀略戰的利器，德國利用千變萬化電波宣傳，在作戰略上得到種種效果，使敵人感到重大的威脅。同時對敵國的電波形勢。又能防備萬全，築起了「心理的防空壕」。茲略介紹德國電波戰術的概況於後</p>
<p>一九三九年九月一日，即德國對波關開戰日的早晨，德國宣傳部和國防部舉行緊急會議，於正午頒布「禁止外國廣播命令」，內容極爲嚴峻，略謂：「在近代戰爭中，敵國不僅藉武力前來進攻，爲謀沮喪我國民士氣，不惜用盡種種方法，前來攻擊，無綫電威力甚大，敵國的無綫電廣播宣傳，都是虛僞宣傳，有害於德國人民。德意志政府確　國民深知其危險，故亟盼國民各自發生責任感，絕對避免　　外國的播音，如有缺乏此項責任感者，國防委員會特頒佈下列命令：</p>
<p>第一條：外國播音，禁止收聽，違者處罰，罪狀輕者沒收收音機。第二條：傳佈外國電台所播消息，亦加處罰，罪狀重者處以死刑」。（第三條以下略）。</p>
<p>前當奧地利問題發生時，捷克問題發生時，德國不僅許可收聽外國廣播，且以「德國國民大度能容，以批判的態度，聽取外國播音」自誇其鎭靜。故以前收聽短波本受獎勵的，但自後即加以嚴禁。當德法簽訂停戰協定時德國准許法國海軍繼續存在，但不准法國播音，法國播音員如有反抗，將處以法兵反抗以上的極刑，電波謀略宣傳之如何重大深刻，於是可見。全世界無綫電的收聽者，據說有三萬萬人，無綫電是不論男女老幼，官民人等都可以號召的，其大衆性實爲強力的武器，強力的宣傳機關無出其右。</p>
<p>德國對於電波虎，與軍事的作戰，視爲同等重要，故而警告國民說：「前次大戰時突擊的先鋒是砲轟，現在則改爲利用電波擾亂心理。外國電台利用德語播音，日以繼夜，企圖挫折國民士氣，諸君諒已洞悉。德意志國民必須常保清純，勿爲外國的罪言所染濁而墮落，國民各自築起心理的防空壕，以防心裏的轟炸。」</p>
<p>音樂裏的謀略</p>
<p>至於德國的電波攻勢，是很微妙的，試舉一例如下：倫敦的某一個家庭中，主人抽著捲煙，主婦旋著收音機的絞盤，正是晚餐方罷的時候，靠在安樂椅子裏的夫婦，恍惚地聽著管絃樂「茶花女」的美妙的樂曲。忽然，演奏中止，　進嘴來：「亞爾蒙爲什麽要造棄茶花女？亞爾蒙這種不道德的行爲，乃取法於其叔父張伯倫，資產階段的代表者張伯倫首相……」雖然可厭卻是軟欵的語調，暴露了張伯優化的兇極惡。語聲既止，繼續演奏「茶花女」，夫婦倆喊一聲「啊」，面面相覷，音樂是如此曼妙，終於聽到完畢。</p>
<p>這個曲調奏了幾遍之後英國國民對張伯倫首相的信仰心，無形中減薄了，不過其效果並不是立刻具體的表現出來的。張伯倫在任何時向國民呼　時，總有「那傢伙說些什麽」的話插入。在離間國民與其指導者一點上，是極其巧妙的。</p>
<p>電波戰的勝利</p>
<p>廣播的效果立刻見之於事實的，是在西部戰綫。當繼軍進軍巴黎時，德國無綫電台向都市四周的法國居民發出　造道：「德國戰車和轟炸機前來攻擊，快些避難」。一時陷於恐慌狀態，無數的難民，攬帶大批行李，阻塞了道路，　入迷道，這時急切赴前綫的法國援軍，爲難民所阻，無法行進，遂造成失敗的原因。</p>
<p>巴巴爵士是德國電台上最動人的播音員，他操著一口流利的英語，向英國廣播，使英國人爲之心折，甚至有人投函英當局稱：「請於九時左右，停止對柏林轟炸，以免聽取巴巴爵士的播音發生困難。」他的受人歡迎有如此者。英國人認爲巴巴爵士也是英國人，否則英語不會如此流利的。他的播音壯　並作，例如他曾經播過下例一個故事：</p>
<p>「英國人史密斯，和德國人施密德在瑞士的一家旅館中相逢，兩人一面喝啤酒，一面說笑，決心避免談及戰爭，而以空談爲事。因此施密德微笑著把對手說服。最後史密斯聽到英國政府擬將自倫敦避難的貧民階級兒童，再度分配於倫敦的家庭的話，憤不可遏，爲反對政府這種暴亂的方針，急急歸國了。」</p>
<p>而且巴巴爵士還在無綫電中作如此的播音：「偕問英國海軍當局，你們所稱安全的某某兵艦，現在在那裏？」英國國民聽了這話，就迫著海軍當局發表該艦的安全與否，當局無可如何，只得發表說某某艦在沿海巡航。</p>
<p>神秘的間諜綱</p>
<p>英首相邱吉爾及外相艾登曾有一次訪問法國瑪奇諾戰綫時，在里爾城舉行正式午餐，當然這事是嚴守秘密的。但當他們列席午宴不到十分鐘，約摸在　上菜單的時候，德國方面已向英國播送這消息。英法國民詳細聽到這個極秘密消息，都大爲驚異，德國諜報綱的威力，概可想見。</p>
<p>波蘭作戰時，德國電台，並不作德國的宣傳，只是播送英國飛機數百架開到波蘭援助，而且義大利已參加英法方面等消息，這是沮喪波蘭人士氣最敏捷的方法，他們抱著莫明其妙的希望，事實上這種希望在數小時內就崩潰了。</p>
<p>「諸君，我們要在明晨九時，空襲倫敦。」德國電台如此播音後，第二天的這個時候，德國空軍果然空襲倫敦，這種大膽的電波戰術，使敵國人民對於德國的播音，又相信，又恐懼。同時又故意表發不詳實的作戰計劃，乘敵不防，德空軍發揮其巨大的威力。（譯自七月廿四日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>東綫方面，蘇軍展開攻勢，企圖自東北方突入華沙市內，遭德軍猛烈抵抗。進駐斯洛伐克之德軍，則　喀爾巴阡山脈，建築最後堅强防綫。北法方面德軍，採用彈性戰術，繼續向東北方解脫，先後退出慮昂·凡爾登·里姆斯·亞　各地，巴黎德守軍亦已完成任務，美軍一部份坦克車隊迫近法瑞邊境。南法方面，戰事沿羅尼河向里昂方面進展中。（根據八月十七日每日新聞製圖）</p>

<h3>夜渡太湖</h3>
<p>— 琪葵</p>
<p>人們聽到了響起的馬達聲，才如有歸宿地各各走到了自己的船上，石橋上，港岸邊，擠著一批看似專爲送行的觀閑者。</p>
<p>我們穿船走向輪船後拖著的第一艘炭貨船，再看他們一艘艘接運起來，輪船拉起了漫長的回聲後就晃著身開動了。石橋·瓦舍·港口都渺小的朝後隱去，天色也隨著黯淡起來，時鐘已敲過五時了。</p>
<p>濁流滾滾地闊了開來，望去只見一片茫茫海水，一脈山嶼慢慢的橫近過來。</p>
<p>爲了欣賞這謐靜的黃昏景色，我　立在船艙高處讓無遮蔽的風從各處吹來，極目四望，旅途的疲勞消逝了。我出神的領會這蒼蒼的太湖暮色，讓窄空的心　飛入了無擾的境界去。</p>
<p>「看這條游龍！」</p>
<p>黑的蔣君，指給我看背後一連長長的拖船，從我立著的一艘起，有七條都裝得沉甸甸的貨船，在隨著輪船的前進而前進著，一事偌大的船身在遼闊的湖面上，只是一條玲瓏修長的帶子，七張滿孕著風的大布篷，顚簸著，恰如偃　垂暮的老人。</p>
<p>「你有膽跟我上最末隻船去！」</p>
<p>我接受了挑戰，隨著蔣起步，一艘二艘，跳過了各個船尾船頭的空隙，完成了一次艱辛的旅程樣的路上了最後自己的一艘船。</p>
<p>著游龍之尾了。</p>
<p>暮色抹上了寒　，滾滾濁浪黑黝黝的深沉下來，東邊一脈山嶼，已巨人樣地矗立在眼前，峻偉的嶺腳，好像兩條胳膊，企望環擁著這俏媚的湖波。</p>
<p>船頭的「顓風香」燒剩一縷殘煙，夜太湖昏暗的暮色漸漸籠罩住我們，山居三月的我，確是竟至認它是兩個世界的隔絕者了。</p>
<p>機輪聲單調悽寂的在太空中喘著，也只有它可慰藉著我們說是：「正在向著目的地進發呢！」船伕愴然的訴說著使人寒慄的故事。睜眼四瞧，無星月的夜空似乎要壓得使人窒息了。</p>
<p>唐用樹柴做了個三角架，將僅有的一枝步槍朝向駛近的墨黑的一堆亙山架上，他卸下戎裝，岸旁樹的側影成了我想像里一個標悍的湖匪。</p>
<p>機輪聲給山壁擋回，聽覺沉重起來，船伕說這是盛達水果風景極好的西山，只想著今晚爲什麽沒月亮呢？有了她，甯願守過這風寒露濕的湖夜，來滋潤我久處凡庸的身軀和枯寂的心靈。</p>
<p>輪船裏連續響起了兩聲輕微的槍聲，蔣說是塗木君的手槍。我對伏著的唐說：「發！」迅捷的震耳聲閃在太空里爆發了開來，山那邊於是敏速的響起了清澈爽脆的回聲。</p>
<p>夜風峭厲，我爬進了後艙底，驟然的各暖，使我毫不擇地的屈身在柏油味的板上，單調的輪聲。卻使我慢慢閉上眼來。</p>
<p>朦朧里，有幾響槍聲，透出艙面襲著的冷氣，又將我縮了回來，索性譔睡夢渡去這夜吧！</p>
<p>張開眼來，有黯淡的曙光從隙處漏了進來，聽到了溫情的柔笑，再不是膽怯的談吐，我一骨碌爬出艙板。</p>
<p>什麽時候已駛出了太源，什麽時候傍住胥口？橫堅劃過了一夜平靜的湖波。</p>
<p>曉色靜穆的展開，一輪紅日爲我們祝賀平安的旅程，而染艷了朶朶雲彩。微波的漣漪，唱著輕快的曲子：</p>
<p>「我們沒有澎湃波濤驚濤駭浪，爲了遠行的遊子太切望著　歸家鄉！」</p>
<h3>表姐的來信</h3>
<p>— 若凡</p>
<p>烈日似火傘般的高撐著，除了爲生活而奔波的人，誰也不想到街上去。爲了畢業後的升學就業問題，我想去跟我表姐商酌，說定了昨天到我家來的她，卻始終沒見著，正在納悶的當兒，樓下起了一陣狗吠聲，大概是表姐來了吧？推開了窗，往天井裏瞧，然而沒見什麽人進來，半點兒人影踪也沒有。</p>
<p>門上起了剝啄，進來的卻是鄭媽，遞給了我一封信，啊，是表姐的來信：——</p>
<p>漠妹</p>
<p>我很羡慕你，至今還度著快樂的學生生活。但是，我也很爲你擔憂，因爲你今更也得高中畢業了，下學期還繼續升學嗎？我希望你還是讀書吧。昨天，在媽的口中，知道你有就職的願望，這是很可嘉的。因爲你知道姑父的負擔太重了，你想以你的力量，來分負一部份。然而你的個性是那末的剛毅，你不會趨迎附勢，你不懂得作僞，你不肯屈膝低頭，你坦白而信任一切，這種種與二年前的我，又有何異？但是，二年來，這社會，這現實的生活，把我壓得透不過氣來，把我的意志打得粉碎，證實了我以前的理想是那來的天眞幼稚！世界決沒有如你想像的那末簡單。你說我是多么的快活呀！成天的與小天使們聚在一起，再也沒有比這更愉快的了！——「當你在園中，被孩子們找到了時，他們的欣喜和歡呼，他們發狂似的投向你的懷抱，向你奔來，緊緊地把你圍住了。猶如一羣小雞庇護在母雞兩翼之下。你是何等地光榮，偉大！」可是現在呢？我已不能再衛護他們，魔鬼把我們生生的擴離了！告訴你，我是被辭了！</p>
<p>當你聽到這個消息的時候，該是多么的驚異啊！你一定要問我這是爲了什麽吧？是否我有什麽做錯了呢！是的，請你先別那末的驚奮，這原是很簡單的，我現在知道我確是做錯了！我不該見了校長主任——等，不去趨奉計好，搬些敎職員間的動態報告他們；我不該太在孩子們的工作上辛勤，爲了他們而對校方提出要求，以至引起了同事間的嫉　；我不該繫得孩子們太緊，不僅是我自己所任的一組，而至於全校；我不該爲了全體敎職員的福利計而與學校當局有所爭執。……這一切的一切，都是我被辭的原因，我深知道，尤其是後者，當局對我懷著莫大的憤恨。這是我自己的過失，又去問誰呢？……</p>
<p>漠妹，由於我的遭遇，我勸你還是再讀幾年書吧！因爲你不比我，你還有姑父，而我卻幼年失怙，媽把我扶養成長，又給我讀了幾年書。現在，她年老了，我又沒有兄弟姊妹，這生活的重擔壓著我，不得不走向謀業的途徑。當初，我乃有鑒於學界是目前女子職業中較爲清高的，又加上了生性喜歡和小孩兒們聚在一起，覺得祇有他們，是世界上最純潔，最可愛的。我以爲敎育是對下的工作，以兒童爲本位。那知道到了現在，我才明白過來，原來目前的敎育工作，卻並不如此。敎師祇是死敎書，把書敎完了，也就自了。而最重要的，乃在連絡校方有權威者，要能體諒校長！說到待遇，每月拿一千五百元的薪水，此外還有什麽政府補助金。（這學通共只領到二三兩月份的，僅一百四十元。）爲了不夠開支，只得在課餘再任家庭敎職，一處每月五百，一處較優，每月八百，但須敎三個程度不同的孩子。這樣下來，回家已在晚上八時多了，還得批改校內的未完課卷，整天像一架機器，不斷地在敎呀，講呀，批呀中盤旋。所得的報酬總算可以有三頓粥吃了，爲了學期結束前的一月，米價飛漲，敎師們爲了生活，提議向學生家長收取補助費，（當時也有官方命令）還給校方罵一聲：「高等討飯！」在有損校譽，妨礙下期學生人數的原則下，默默地打消了！照理說，確是不該再向家長們收取的，因爲家長繳費的時候，是一次繳清的，記得在開學時，米價還祇在三百元左右一斗，　使我們也能一次拿到六個月薪水的話，別的不要說，至少把半年的米，可以買好了，生活的影響也受不了多少。然而，開學時這一筆諾大的款項，還不是全數到了校長先生的腰包裏！他們做買賣，投機，營利，發大財，祇苦了我們，開學時的一千五百元，到了放學時的一千五百元，其比值相差何等遠大，但又有誰來管你！</p>
<p>好了，現在我是失業了，連盤旋的工作也沒做了，我知道了我的錯，我的過失，可是太晚了；米缸裏的米祇剩下一些兒了。假使這個月內，再找不著工作的話，那末祇得跟媽回鄉去。鄉間雖不是好地方，且要看大伯們的嘴臉，還要訴說媽的不該把辛苦掙來的錢，給女孩子讀書，一早得配個好人家，豈不可享福了？好吧！十靈敏年來的奮鬥，希望，都成了泡影。我即不能征服環境，那祇得向環境屈服！漠妹！你是有希望的。努力吧！你記著遠遠的還有一個表姊的話，你該去爭取眞理！</p>
<p>祝你前程無疆！</p>
<p>愚姊　敏芝留言</p>
<p>七月二十五日。</p>
<p>讀了表姊的來信，使我的內心，充滿了忿恨和不平，表姊並沒有錯。她是無辜的！難道我們就這樣無聲息地被犧牲了嗎？不能，像表姊一樣無理由的被辭職敎師，一定還有，據我所知，上學期徵收補助金的學校，也不僅是我表姊所任的一校，同命運的敎師，大家起來向社會爲正議呼　吧！我雖是一個不知世事的孩子，但是我要鼓勵我的表姊，告訴她我們都是有希望的！眞正的負罪者不是她。正如表姊所說的一樣，我們要爭取眞理！我相信世界決不會永久的爲黑暗所蒙蔽，光明總有一天會來的。只要我們斷的不去爭取！我們年青者，不能一受挫折，就畏縮退讓，相反的，我們更要迎上去，征服環境！改造環境！</p>

<h3>參觀游泳賽歸來</h3>
<p>市體育會主辦之本年度全滬華人男婦游泳錦標賽，於本週三（三十日）在靜安寺路東亞體育館游泳池舉行，爲本季滬上唯一之游泳正式比賽，記者乃欣然往觀。是日天氣懊熱，而觀衆接踵而來，與賽健兒，當然混身水淋，看客亦汗濕衣衫也。於此可見游泳運動，並非不爲人所注意。提倡者發展乏術，蓋格於　上游泳也之缺少，我人何能多加批評。茲光敘是日所得印象，及男女冠軍之描寫。</p>
<p>參加人數不多成績未見良好</p>
<p>此次所參加之男女賽員，共計二十九人，而女子僅　四名，可調冷寂。故各項比賽大致均爲決賽。乃自開始至結束，費時未及二小時，可以推及矣。所獲成績，實屬大失所望，切莫談打破新紀錄，較舊紀錄相差尚遠，不禁感慨係之。保游泳成績之大開倒車耶？</p>
<p>男女各人冠軍均係水國老將</p>
<p>男子個人總冠軍爲陳玉泉許守強並獲，女子則爲林美玲所獲得。緣此三將，　上水壇早具盛名，固皆老手也。全賽名單中，亦僅此三人，較有曆史，餘均爲新人。初也，我人極希望青出於藍，此多年老將未必能　叱風雲，有誰料結果盡屬三將之世界？新人中簡直無一能與之頡頑，非特此也，抑且有數人姿勢，完全不成其局。人材凋零，一至如斯。原因當蜀不經良好指導，與乎自不量力耳。但我，當局應求謀改進。唯季節一過，又將爲人漠然置時，當不致依然如此毫無所獲。</p>
<h3>介紹男女冠軍</h3>
<p>林美玲</p>
<p>林小姐在四年前滬上公開錦標賽中早露頭角，曾壓倒當年喧嚇一時之番女卡萊爲人所稱道。林小姐事正輕，此數年中，實因鮮場地練習，及指導乏人。否則目下之成績，周未必讓美人魚專美於前。林體格健碩，身段伶俐，游泳時姿勢甚爲美觀，此次除五十碼自由式比賽時，黃月梅與之略有競爭外，其餘二項，鮮有人競爭。此成績不佳之附帶原因。</p>
<p>陳玉泉</p>
<p>陳君乃　産，得天獨厚，水中身手，在滬上有名亦久。然陳年事已老，與足球中之李天生有相似。此次加入，固未料新人材之如此缺乏，依然稱雄。其五十碼百碼猶能獨佔鰲頭。然四百碼中則不免屈居於許守強之後，由此可見共長力之不如人矣。</p>
<p>許守強</p>
<p>許君乃中青游泳圈之健將，本爲老將，而本屆仍有機會練習及名師薰陶，（梁兆安係中青國教練）故演出時之經驗勝入，一望而知。其四百碼自由式在轉身時之一記反身，非但姿勢絕美，似鮫龍出水，且也佔得便宜。一轉身間，亦取得四五驪之超前，此皆經騐之勝人也。許君處心異常，來日不難在水國逞能，願許群勉之，來日方長。</p>
<p>山同權</p>
<p>山君爲水陸兩樓人材，藍球爲大華隊乙組之主將，小型球爲同仕隊之靈魂，足球會一度代表三省隊。此次僅加入花式跳水一項，果溺不負使命，榮騰第一。其表演各種花式姿勢，如鯉之跳，如友之旋，觀衆莫不鼓掌，同君其餘成績，相當可觀。據云，此番爲集中力量，故祇加入跳水一項而已。</p>
<h3>池畔一覽</h3>
<p>此次比賽，準備似蜀短促，故一切均見雜亂，而當時之各辦事人乃兌忙得走頭無路矣。</p>
<p>沈嗣良女公子沈郇望小姐爲上屆女子冠軍，最近因身體欠佳，故未能一顯身手。然是日亦來參觀，對於林美玲之　勢及黃月梅之體格，均認爲極標凖。</p>
<p>看客意格較老者，就樓上俯上視。蓋在樓下池畔觀望，則水花花四濺，乃受淋涇之苦矣。</p>
<p>林美玲小姐早有把握奪得冠軍，到場助威之姊妹四五人，亦所以爲　獎品之助，初不料僅得小銀杯一座，大概物力維艱，不得不爾。</p>
<p>花式跳水裁判爲淩希陶梁兆安俞斌祺三位，其批評之分數，有時相差甚多，豈英雄所見不同耶？</p>
<p>張嘉箴小姐爲唯一女子職員，奔走報告紀錄，其見賣力，張亦係游泳好手。</p>
<h3>主將退出　熊貓敗於葡商　今晨若勝海賊尙有奪標希望</h3>
<p>本月二十七日膠州公園突然萬頭攢動，開夏季球賽未有之盛況。蓋是日乃華人壘毬勁旅　熊貓，火拼葡商紅隊，然不幸是賽熊貓失敗，以一此五受挫。在場萬千球迷，莫不同聲歎息。然是賽雙方已達表演最高水準，戰程緊張熱烈。今略記其過程及華隊失敗原因於下：</p>
<p>主將缺席影　實力　是日華隊唯一最善</p>
<p>之重擊手王秀山，未會出場，進攻實力大打折扣。本來華隊　球已差，王君一缺，更覺進攻無路，入分無門。開王君近因事已退出，今後實力必受影響也。</p>
<p>擊球太弱進攻無略</p>
<p>熊貓弱點乃在擊球。在壘方面敢稱全滬獨一。在是賽中記者早料華隊上壘機會甚少，因華隊不善擊此其一。葡隊湯拔拉胖子之旋風式投球此其二。然華隊又不能隨機慶變，利用短攀，於是棒揮球接，徒費心血，若能利用短擊，「踫」球至投手胖子之旁或沿一壘線，則獲分機會必多也。</p>
<p>你推我讓致命之傷</p>
<p>是賽華隊所以敗北，實第一局中錯誤最多。蓋華隊諸將臨陣過於鎮靜。本來壘毬各員，各司其位，對接高球，互不爭奪。誰知是日因彼此爭接高球，致使相互以爲對方接球，應接而不接者竟犯二次之多。致使葡隊從容上壘，而致失分累累。</p>
<p>葡隊擊球得心應手</p>
<p>葡隊善擊，實之主因。各員平均，且球之落點極佳。華隊外翼無所施其技，在第一局中，奧利維拉及福恩均妙擊上壘，論至該隊靈魂湯拔拉出擊，一棒球飛直左外翼，且疝邊線直穿，此一棒實奠定勝局，在壘之二人均歸壘，而拔拉得一全壘打（Hone　rnn）。此局華隊連失三分，從呼奈何。此後在第三局及六局中，均因葡隊擊球及拔拉之再妙擊而再失二分，實無可挽救。</p>
<p>葡隊外翼表演出色</p>
<p>華隊出擊，雖盡最大努力，但因不用短擊，而致擊出之球均爲葡隊外翼V蘇若及潘利拉所妙接，前後共達五次之多。且均爲難接之球，否則若漏接，華隊恐不致失敗。</p>
<p>冠軍爭奪　尚有希望</p>
<p>熊貓此次雖敗，除擊球不如人外，球運亦太差也。不過現聯賽形勢中除猶太及菲僑乙不足道外，餘諸強中，除熊貓及西青，葡商紅各敗一次外。菲僑甲及海賊均敗二次。故華隊冠軍尚有希望。今日上午九時三刻，對海賊一役，華隊若勝之，則於下星期日戰西青。此役若再勝之，則將與葡商紅再決奪錦標。故今日華隊必全力以求勝利，否則冠軍無望矣。今日敵隊乃蒙諸麾下如浮尼克及沙司金兄弟等，實力不弱。最強如葡商紅亦因輕敵而遭其毒手，故華隊宜僅慎出擊爲要。</p>

<h3>Weekday Commentary: Impressions of the Seventh Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>On September 1st, the Municipal Consultative Committee held its seventh plenary meeting. The central issue of this meeting was the discussion of adjustments to the treatment of police and security forces. The records have been seen in today's newspapers. I would like to express my views on attending the meeting as follows:</p>
<p>Firstly, the treatment of police and security forces needs to be reasonably adjusted. The opinions of the consultative committee members are completely consistent in principle, and they all agree that it is a necessary move. However, regarding the huge amount of funds required after the treatment adjustment, which would be taken from increasing citizens' taxes, there were two different opinions among the consultative committee members. One opinion advocated increasing the four-percent retail tax to six percent, with the increased two percent specifically designated for adjusting treatment. The other opinion advocated not increasing taxes, or increasing one percent while reorganizing old taxes, so as not to increase the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important issue at present is public security. The importance and necessity of maintaining public security, as well as the connection between the duties of the police and security forces and public security, have been discussed in our newspaper's editorials continuously for a year. If we want the police and security forces to fulfill their important task of maintaining public security, it cannot be accomplished under the current living conditions where their treatment is insufficient. In other words, it is simply empty talk and will have no practical effect to try and establish public security without increasing funding and adjusting the treatment of the police and security forces. It is gratifying that this issue has now aroused the attention of all sectors and is considered necessary.</p>
<p>I further believe that increasing the funding for public security to achieve a reasonable adjustment in the treatment of police and security forces is a considerable amount. Passively reorganizing old taxes is probably not enough. Of course, reorganizing old taxes is an important task in current finance and should be implemented in a coordinated manner. However, it is questionable whether this is sufficient for public security funding. Since it has been decided to adjust treatment, we must thoroughly satisfy the minimum requirements of each individual. Therefore, I do not agree with the light tax policy, which results in a half-hearted and ineffective outcome.</p>
<p>Increasing taxes should not be considered unnecessarily or feared. What must be considered is whether the purpose of the tax increase is legitimate, whether the use is necessary, and whether the tax rate is appropriate. The decision to increase taxes or not should be made based on the results of these considerations. Secondly, what should be feared is whether the collection, management, and use of tax revenue are reasonable. In short, as long as it is taken from the people and used for the people, increasing taxes is not a problem. Moreover, citizens are currently spending a considerable amount of money under other names besides taxes, so why not simply and universally increase taxes a little? Citizens should not be afraid of paying taxes, but rather of preventing leakage and embezzlement.</p>
<p>In short, increasing taxes and reorganizing taxes are not contradictory issues. The only question is which can thoroughly achieve the goal. Now that the principle of adjusting the treatment of police and security forces has been passed, it is hoped that the police and security authorities will quickly prepare the most reasonable and ideal budget, the municipal authorities will consider and decide to implement it as soon as possible, and the central financial authorities and allied authorities will provide practical assistance. In the future, tax collection must be universal, and residents of any nationality, whether Chinese or foreign, must pay taxes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the director of the allocation office reported at the meeting that teachers and staff in public and private schools would be given special allocations and treated the same as civil servants, which could be implemented immediately. The authorities' consideration for the dedication of education workers deserves gratitude.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the special tax fraud case was also mentioned. It is under investigation and is being handled jointly by the police, judicial, special high police, and other relevant departments. The authorities expressed great determination to handle it impartially. There are rumors outside that criticize the consultative committee for making many suggestions and criticisms regarding the rice issue, but few criticisms regarding the special tax fraud case. In fact, this is a misunderstanding, because the municipal authorities have already expressed their determination to rectify the special tax fraud case and are implementing a thorough investigation, which is different from the rice issue and cannot be confused.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the special tax fraud case, the group fraud of public officials is certainly illegal, and the attempt of some merchants to evade taxes is also illegal, and those who collude in fraud are even more illegal. In the future, the municipal government should rectify tax collection, and the industrial and commercial circles and citizens must also exercise self-discipline. It is hoped that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will lead the industry guilds to promote a "no tax evasion movement" and advise members to abide by their tax obligations and not evade taxes, so that tax revenues can be sufficient and municipal administration can be on the right track, and all citizens will benefit.</p>

<h3>Air Raid on the Ogasawara Islands: Eleven Enemy Planes Shot Down; Japanese Forces Counterattack Approaching Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific, on the afternoon of the 31st of last month, a group of carrier-based planes, seemingly from an enemy task force, attacked the Ogasawara Islands. Approximately 40 planes attacked Chichijima, about 7 planes attacked Hahajima, and approximately 40 planes attacked Iwo Jima. As a result of the Japanese counterattack, three planes were shot down on Chichijima and four planes were shot down on Iwo Jima. The next morning, enemy carrier-based planes repeatedly attacked Chichijima, totaling about 100 planes, and the same occurred on Hahajima, totaling about 130 planes. In the morning, enemy warships also shelled Chichijima from the sea. The Japanese forces bravely counterattacked. So far, it has been confirmed that four planes were shot down on Chichijima and seven planes were shot down on Iwo Jima.</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack US Air Force Bases in Chongqing, Heavily Damage Liuzhou and Denzhu Airfields</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese front-line base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the dawn of the 1st, Japanese night bomber squadrons, braving adverse weather conditions, attacked US Air Force bases in Chongqing, Liuzhou, and Denzhu, achieving great results. Details are as follows: Recently, the US Air Force in Chongqing has frequently attacked Japanese bases with the aid of radio wave detectors. The Japanese forces have also been conducting effective tail-chase attacks against them. On the night of the 31st, enemy planes launched a wave attack on Japanese forces. The Japanese night bomber squadrons waited until they had dropped their bombs and were about to flee before taking off in pursuit and attacking. Although the weather in Liuzhou was extremely bad, the Japanese planes were able to enter the target airspace. When the US Air Force in Chongqing realized that Japanese planes were attacking, fighter planes took off to intercept them. At this time, the Japanese planes used skillful tactics to drop bombs that hit their targets. Three large planes caught fire after being hit, and two large planes and two small planes have been confirmed to have been destroyed. In addition, the Japanese planes that attacked Denzhu, after a hard fight, also broke through into the airspace above Liuzhou and dropped bombs that hit their targets, braving intense anti-aircraft fire. Two small planes caught fire after being hit, and three other ground facilities were destroyed and caught fire. The Japanese planes returned safely.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the evening of the 1st, Japanese aircraft units attacked the Jianchuan airfield in Jiangxi Province, setting fire to three locations, including fuel depots and what appeared to be barracks, and bombed the runway. All planes returned.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Around Yichang</h3>
<p>Lisbon (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan front is as follows: The Chongqing army launched an offensive around Yichang three weeks ago in order to prevent the Japanese army from reinforcing the Hunan front, but it has achieved nothing. It is impossible for the Chongqing army to retake Yichang with its current strength and equipment. However, it may be possible to prevent the Japanese army from doing so. Currently, the Japanese army is attacking southwest of Hengyang, where two of the most elite divisions of the Chongqing army are concentrated on both sides of the Xianggui Railway. It is believed that the Japanese army's purpose is to eliminate the Chongqing army's resistance to Hengyang. The Chongqing authorities issued a statement on the 31st, saying that the army was currently attacking southwest of Hengyang. The front line eight to ten kilometers northeast of Yichang, Hubei Province, is the Chongqing army's counter-offensive line, and the Japanese army is reinforcing from Yichang, so both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In addition, the Japanese army, which launched a counter-offensive in Changyang, became more fierce after receiving reinforcements. There was fierce fighting all day on the 29th.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, a powerful Japanese force is currently preparing to attack west of Weiyang, so a major battle may break out near Shiqing. According to foreigners returning from Weiyang, the Japanese army has built strong positions one kilometer west of Hengyang and is bombarding the Chongqing army with heavy artillery fire. The Chongqing army has also counterattacked repeatedly, but has been unable to suppress the Japanese army due to insufficient artillery fire. The Japanese army is actively consolidating its positions west of Hengyang, and a major battle may soon develop near Shiqing.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army began operations on August 12th, it quickly occupied Lishui. As of August 20th, the results of the battle included 690 corpses left behind by the Chongqing army and 698 prisoners. In addition, the Japanese army captured seven heavy machine guns and three mortars from the Chongqing army. The Japanese army suffered only 45 casualties.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Burma Converge on Longling</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing army is still stubbornly attacking La Meng, Tengchong, and Longling, but its morale has been greatly reduced due to difficulties in resupply and repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Furthermore, the Japanese southern forces are launching an offensive from the Yunnan-Burma Road. A portion of the force has gathered near Mangshi, and another force is advancing towards Longling from the south. On the 27th of last month, they broke through the Chongqing army's encirclement and arrived in Longling City, where they joined forces with the Japanese garrison in the city. They began to attack east and northeast of Longling, and the battle situation is quite favorable.</p>

According to a United Press dispatch, diplomatic circles in Washington revealed that the leaders of the anti-Axis military operations will also participate in this meeting, so it will mainly discuss military issues. It is difficult to predict the content of the agreement, but considering that Roosevelt recently inspected the Pacific war zone and Stalin will not participate in this meeting, the purpose of the meeting may be centered on the war against Japan.</p>
<h3>The Pass-Through Tax Has Been Revised Again and Is Now Collected According to the Ticket Price</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Finance formulated the Provisional Regulations on Pass-Through Tax, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation on November 5th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). It stipulates that passengers on airplanes, trains, public buses, trams, long-distance buses, and ships must pay a maximum of 10% of the ticket price. Since its implementation, the results have been good. The regulations were submitted to the 220th meeting of the Executive Yuan on August 16th and revised to the following: The Pass-Through Tax is collected at a maximum of 20% of the ticket price. For train, tram, public bus, long-distance bus, and ship passengers, the tax is collected at 20% of the ticket price for first-class and second-class passengers, 10% of the ticket price for third-class passengers, and 6% of the ticket price for fourth-class passengers. For vehicles and ships that do not sell tickets by class, all passengers pay 10% of the ticket price. Airplane passengers pay 20% of the ticket price. Passengers who purchase through tickets, round-trip tickets, long-term tickets, or group tickets pay 6% of the total ticket price. For passengers on special express trains, in addition to the ordinary ticket portion being taxed according to class, the surcharge for the special express train ticket is taxed at 10% regardless of class. The sleeper ticket price is also taxed at 10% regardless of class.</p>

Pass-Through Tax inspector offices will be established in various regions to supervise the collection and reporting of taxes. Border areas launch mountain pass battles.</p>
<h3>Soviet Armored Units Launch Mountain Pass Battles on the Bulgarian Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 2nd that Soviet rapid armored units have launched an offensive throughout the western Danube River region, with the aim of attempting to reach Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The first stage of the Soviet army's summer offensive on the Eastern Front is showing signs of coming to an end. The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive between the northern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and Narva, which lasted for several weeks. However, in the last ten days, it has only launched fierce attacks in a few places, and has finally turned into feigned attacks. The Soviet army is concentrating its reserves to prepare for another fierce attack. Battles are taking place in the mountain passes between Bistrita and Focsani in the south. The teams are advancing into Hungary and encountering strong resistance. The Soviet army that invaded Wallachia is engaged in fierce fighting with the German army south of Ploiesti and west of Buzau, and is often blocked by the German rearguard forces. The mobile warfare in Romania is changing rapidly, forming an interlocking defense line.</p>
<h3>The Offensive Against Warsaw Ultimately Failed</h3>
<p>Currently, the Soviet army is launching a fierce attack on Warsaw on both banks of the Bug River. The Soviet army that is attacking between Radzymin and Łomża has at least four infantry divisions and several tank corps. The focus of the battle is on the south bank of the Bug River. Although the Soviet army occupied Radzymin after six fierce attacks, the German army has built a new defense line to the south.</p>
<h3>Giraud Wounded in Assassination Attempt</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Former Commander-in-Chief of the North African puppet army, General Giraud, after being placed on the retired list, resided in Mostaganem (near Oran) in North Africa. Several days ago, Giraud was seriously injured in an assassination attempt. When he returned to his home, a guard stationed in front of the gate of his villa fired at him, one bullet piercing his cheek and destroying several teeth.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Places Orders for Cloth in the United States</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing side sent Kong Xiangxi, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, to the United States in July to attend the so-called International Monetary Conference. On the 29th, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency attacked him, saying that Kong Xiangxi's only major task in going to the United States was to have the United States import 2,000 tons of foreign cloth to Chongqing every month, but this was only a means for a group of government officials to make a fortune. The gist of the report is as follows: Kong Xiangxi recently concluded an agreement in the United States to import 2,000 tons of foreign cloth every month. One ton of foreign cloth is equivalent to 2 million bolts, so 400,000 bolts can be imported every month. One bolt of foreign cloth costs only 7 US dollars in the United States. The shipping cost from the United States to Calcutta by sea and then by plane from there to Chongqing is approximately 5 US dollars per bolt at most, bringing the original price to 12 US dollars, or 480 legal tender yuan. However, one bolt of foreign cloth is currently worth 30,600 yuan, so one bolt can make a profit of 30,120 yuan. 400,000 bolts per month amount to approximately 120 million yuan, and the profit for one year is 1.44 trillion yuan. Many members of the middle faction are dissatisfied with this behavior of the government. Currently, there is no shortage of foreign cloth in the interior, but it is all being hoarded to drive up prices. Because the masses do not have the funds to purchase it, this large-scale import is merely a money-making opportunity for a small number of officials' compradores and various speculators. On the one hand, China's textile industry will suffer a severe blow, and on the other hand, it will not benefit the people in any way.</p>
<h3>Molotov Receives the Romanian Armistice Delegation</h3>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Romanian armistice delegation leader Patrascanu and two other members on the 31st.</p>
<h3>US Forces Cross the Verdun and Enter the Lorraine Basin: The Focus of the Battle in Northern France Shifts to the Meuse River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The vanguard of US tanks has crossed Verdun and entered the Lorraine Basin. US forces are advancing on Verdun in two routes, each including six to eight divisions. Taking advantage of their superiority in aircraft and tanks, they broke through the German defense line on the river after a fierce battle. US forces have crossed the Meuse River south of Verdun and established three bridgeheads. The US forces from Compiegne have entered the Vervins area via La Fere. A portion of the US forces is advancing northwest via Rethel, threatening the German communication lines between the Aisne and Somme rivers.</p>
<h3>On the American B-29 Type Bomber: Japan and Germany Have Implemented Complete Countermeasures; Japanese Military Expert Reveals Weaknesses of the Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Air Force authorities on the 31st provided an explanation regarding the German military's defense methods against the American "Super Fortress" B-29 type bomber, stating that after the Japanese air squadron achieved a great victory during the first air raid on Japan by American Air Force B-29 type aircraft, they had thoroughly understood the aircraft's weaknesses and technical defects. Now, based on the research results of the Japanese on the enemy B-29 type aircraft, the German military has made precise defense preparations, so in the future, if enemy B-29 type aircraft appear in the European theater of war, the German military will always be able to take complete measures to strike them down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a military expert here speaking to reporters, more than two and a half months have passed since the enemy Americans, with the B-29 type aircraft as their main force, appeared on the East Asian front. Although it is said that they have achieved no results and have often been shot down by the Japanese military, the enemy has actually used this action to heavily promote the rapid progress of the offensive against Japan and the concrete realization of a short-term decisive battle. If we slightly examine the strategic entity of the enemy air force and its movements, there are actually many weaknesses and fragile aspects, and what is particularly worth pointing out is that the completion of the enemy air force's strategy still requires considerable time. The B-29 type aircraft was designed with five goals in mind: "ability to fly long distances," "ability to carry heavy bombs," "ability to fly at extremely high altitudes," "high speed," and "strong defensive power." If we examine each point superficially, it seems to be a "scientific weapon based on theory and experience," but using this as the main force for air force strategic activities has many fragile points. From the perspective of defensive power, its fragile points have been fully exposed. When the enemy aircraft attacked northern Kyushu on the 20th of last month, out of eighty aircraft, twenty-three were indeed shot down by the Japanese military, and more than ten others could not be confirmed, and more than twenty others suffered damage. From the above points alone, the fragility of the enemy B-29 type aircraft is very obvious, because the aircraft body is large, naturally making it an easy target for attack. At the same time, it is more difficult for a large bomber to hit a work target accurately because of its fast flight speed. As the brave Japanese air force soldiers said, "Although the aircraft body's armor is thick, once a weak point is hit, its life is immediately taken." Secondly, the highest altitude bombing that the enemy Americans boast about with the B-29 type aircraft has not yet been seen in practice. When the enemy aircraft is air-raiding the Japanese mainland, the altitude of flight is mostly four or five thousand meters to two thousand meters, which is not only easily attacked by fighter planes, but may not even be out of range of anti-aircraft guns. As for offensive power, the so-called precise bombing of factories, railways, and ports by the B-29 type aircraft has not actually achieved any results, and this weakness is also very obvious. Also, in order to achieve long-distance flights, the amount of armaments it claims to carry is naturally limited. It is naturally difficult to achieve results with such limited bombs for precise bombing. Regarding the issue of the B-29 type aircraft base groups, it must be examined from its performance, because it has long-distance flight performance, so bases can be established far from the bombing target to avoid being threatened by Japanese aircraft, but this will limit the amount of bombs it can carry due to the excessive flight distance, and the rear base is not necessarily safe and may be constantly attacked by Japanese aircraft. Secondly, because the B-29 type aircraft fleet has characteristic maneuverability, it must be able to freely choose a base. In other words, the shortest runway of the base must be more than three to four kilometers, and only twenty aircraft can be accommodated in one location. The completion of this kind of ground organization requires great effort and time. Due to the above difficulties, the activities of the strategic air force are extremely limited. For example, the attempt to bomb the Japanese mainland and the central Pacific island of Saipan has not been realized because the construction of bases is difficult, so the actions of the B-29 type aircraft have not been free. In fact, it is difficult to establish three to five or more runways for B-29 types in the Saipan area, and even if its base is complete, it is necessary to set up nearby defensive facilities. Moreover, the B-29 type aircraft not only requires a large amount of gasoline, but also requires a large number of other consumable repair parts. Each aircraft requires twelve crew members. If thirty aircraft are shot down, then three hundred and sixty people will go to hell. The crew members required for the B-29 type aircraft cannot use those with poor skills. This is the difficulty of replenishing the B-29 type aircraft base and its own fragility. Regarding the production volume of the B-29 type aircraft, since June of this year, three hundred aircraft have been produced each month, and it is expected that two thousand aircraft will be completed by October of this year. Even if two thousand aircraft are completed, only one thousand aircraft can be mobilized on the front line. From the perspective of its difficulties, one thousand aircraft actually have no power, not to mention that the rate of being shot down is very high, so it is still far from success.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Security in the City; Adjusting the Salaries of Police and Security Forces: Proposals from the Seventh Municipal Advisory Conference</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city held its seventh plenary session in the city government conference room on the first of this month. More than twenty committee members attended, including Li Sihao, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and Shen Siliang. In addition to Mayor Chen personally attending, Secretary-General Wu and the heads of various bureaus and departments also attended. First, Chairman Li Sihao reported on two important tasks of the Standing Committee in July: (A) This committee is extremely concerned about the case of corruption by the special consumption tax personnel of the Finance Bureau and has sent a letter to the city government requesting a thorough investigation and suggesting key points for improvement in the future. (B) The Township Committee of this committee has decided to send people to the seven counties and county districts of this city to investigate the actual situation of county administration as a reference for improving county administration. Next, Committee Member Chen Riping reported on the work of the Finance Subcommittee.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Finance Committee</h3>
<p>The Finance Subcommittee held its second and third meetings successively on the 11th and 19th of last month. The second meeting discussed two important matters: The first matter was based on the resolution of the second meeting, and Committee Member Chen Riping drafted a proposed draft of key points for reorganizing the finances of this city. It was revised and passed, and a formal proposal was submitted. The content of the above proposal was to determine the principles for reorganizing the finances of this city, hoping that the Municipal Finance Bureau would draft a new reorganization plan for the city's finances in accordance with these principles, and submit it to the committee for review and submission to the mayor for approval and implementation. The second matter discussed was based on the third plenary committee meeting, accepting the mayor's consultation regarding the current poor collection methods of the special consumption tax and the serious tax evasion. Someone suggested two improvement methods: one using revenue stamps and the other using unified invoices printed and sold by the government. Which method is better? It was decided that the Finance Bureau Director Yuan and the Accounting Office Director Chen should first draft improvement methods in consideration of the actual situation and send them to the committee for review. The convocation of the third meeting was specifically for reviewing the case of corruption by the special tax personnel in charge of the Finance Office of the First District Public Office. In addition to the fact that the authorities should thoroughly investigate and severely punish the corruption, the committee believes that positive aspects must be earnestly rectified, and key points for suggestions were proposed: the competent authorities should quickly compile a plan for rectification and reform; it is hoped to improve the treatment of general staff, etc.</p>
<h3>Teachers and Staff to Receive Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Feng You, the Director of the Goods Distribution Office, reported that according to the previous suggestions of the Advisory Committee, the distribution of rice to public and private teachers and staff in this city is being handled. According to the investigation, there are a total of more than 10,000 teachers and staff in private schools in this city. It has been decided to implement special distribution immediately. The distribution amount is the same as that of civil servants, that is, one dou and three and a half sheng per person per month. Those who also teach can only be recognized to receive special rationed rice.</p>
<h3>Reorganize Tax Revenue to Increase Military and Police Salaries</h3>
<p>The proposals were then discussed and resolved: In order to ensure the important responsibilities of the police and security forces in this city, and the current treatment of the police and security forces is extremely meager, it is urgent to adjust it. The expenses to be increased in this area should be from the reorganization of various tax revenues or the increase in retail tax rates to make up for it. In order to fully assist the administrative facilities of the municipal authorities, the committee decided to set up a special committee for public works, public utilities, and sanitation. Finally, Li Shiyu, the director of the Judicial Office of the Police Bureau, reported on the handling of the investigation of the corruption case of the main organizers of the special consumption tax in this city under order. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Customs Officials' Corruption: Welcome to Report the Facts: Statement by the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" published a letter signed S.K.LM, accusing customs officials of corruption. A reporter interviewed Hei Ze Erlang, Commissioner of Customs, on the morning of the 2nd to inquire about the matter. Hei Ze personally received the reporter and made the following statement:</p>
<h3>Hope to Obtain the Truth of the Facts</h3>
<p>Regarding the letter published in yesterday's "The China Press", the author also received the same letter. The content is exactly the same as that published in the newspaper. However, the signature on the letter received by the author was "Patriot", which is different from S.K.LM published in the newspaper. As for the content stated in the letter, according to the author's opinion, it is not entirely factual and is mostly excessively embellished and does not match the facts. The Customs authorities hope to obtain the truth of the facts to investigate and handle them. Although general rumors are also valued, they are of little benefit in practice because they cannot obtain accurate facts. Regarding the last two paragraphs of the letter stating that the Customs authorities did not punish the corruption cases at the Nantou Branch and the Suzhou River East Branch of the Customs, the author is responsible for completely denying it. After receiving the report of corruption in the two departments, the author immediately took the strictest disciplinary action against those responsible for the two aspects. Many people were punished, those who were seriously punished were dismissed, and others were given appropriate punishments. In short, the author will never tolerate dereliction of duty as long as there is evidence. The above is just one example to illustrate.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Cooperate to Rectify Discipline</h3>
<p>Regarding the possibility that customs officials may have irregularities abroad, several Japanese and Chinese loyal merchants familiar to the author have been entrusted to report directly to the author any improprieties, such as extortion, and to give the most severe punishment, but no reports have been received so far. Regarding the detention of goods mentioned in the letter without issuing a certificate, the author issued Announcement No. 1727 and Thesis No. 4588 on August 29, requiring all merchants and civilians to obtain a detention certificate for detained goods. At the same time, the author explained to the customs officers that they must issue a certificate after detaining the goods, and that obtaining a certificate is a right that merchants and civilians should have, and hoped that all sectors would not give up this right. Various external rumors have been difficult to confirm. The Customs authorities will make the greatest efforts to rectify discipline and need more cooperation from all sectors. Report the facts based on the evidence.</p>
<p>It is useless to just gossip without direct help. The author hopes that Mr. S.K.LM, if he is really a "Patriot", should not be afraid to report to the author in person the truth of the corruption case mentioned in the letter. If only anonymous letters are used to accuse all parties, the Customs authorities cannot accept it because there is no direct plaintiff and the points mentioned are too excessive. In short, the writer of this letter, whether in good faith or malicious, is irresponsible. According to the writer, the current loss of customs duties due to corruption is between 100 million and 150 million yuan per month. Since such precise figures are estimated, they cannot be obtained by accident. Why not report them to the author in person? Or is it said that the accuser is afraid of the author's danger, so he dares not come forward to report. Then I dare to guarantee that anyone who accuses will absolutely not be afraid, and the Customs authorities will never announce the real name of the accuser, and those who commit corruption are most afraid of being exposed and will never allow them to retaliate. Accusers need not be afraid. In short, the Customs authorities must make efforts on their own to rectify the tax revenue administration and ask all sectors to assist more. The author welcomes and appreciates any reports of customs officials' corruption based on facts.</p>
<h3>Household Coal Briquettes Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Six Jin of Coal Briquettes and Two Jin of Coal Dust</h3>
<p>The distribution of household coal briquettes will begin tomorrow in the old First District. Each person will be allocated six jin of coal briquettes and two jin of coal dust, for a total of 20 yuan. All purchases will be made with the No. 13 Comprehensive Joint Ticket from the coal briquette retail outlets with the numbers specified on the ticket. However, the numbering of each retail outlet has been changed. If citizens have any questions, they can inquire at the certificate issuing office of the Goods Distribution Office. All unused coal briquette purchase certificates for the sixth and eighth periods issued in the past will be invalidated. The coal seams allocated this time do not contain any impurities, and the coal briquettes also contain 50% pure coal dust. If citizens find that the coal quality does not match or contains impurities, they are allowed to report it at any time, and they will be severely punished according to law. The distribution in other districts will be slightly delayed for a few days due to the adjustment of retail outlets.</p>
<h3>The New Association Holds a Symposium on the Current Situation: Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the current situation and communicate the opinions of the government and the public, the Shanghai News Association took the opportunity of Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department's visit to Shanghai to invite leaders from all walks of life in this city to hold a symposium on the current situation at the Hua Mao Hotel on the afternoon of the 2nd. In addition to Minister Lin, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and leaders from all walks of life, including Wen Zhaoting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bofan, Yuan Ludeng, Xiang Kangyuan, Chu Baoheng, Yin Yuzi, Song Zhuozai, Chen Riping, Zhou Bangjun, Fu Qiangeng, and Ding Fubao, totaling more than 100 people, attended. First, Jin Xiongbo, the monthly director of the association, reported on the meeting, stating that the association, in view of the fact that it has now entered the decisive stage and the times are becoming more serious, held a symposium on the current situation in order to allow the people to have a deep understanding. Minister Lin happened to be in Shanghai, so he was specially invited to attend and give instructions.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin's Speech</h3>
<p>Minister Lin was then invited to report. First, he described in detail the distant and near causes of the chairman's illness and the process of diagnosis and treatment before and after, and said that since the chairman went to Japan for treatment due to his health, all parties have paid great attention to him. The chairman's condition has been reported by Minister Chu, Governor Chen, and recently Dean Zhou Si in the newspaper. The chairman's treatment has been going smoothly since arriving in Japan. Now that the hot summer has passed and the weather is gradually becoming cool, this situation will definitely recover quickly. Please tell everyone to rest assured. Secondly, he said that under the current situation, the government's strength must be combined with the people's strength to overcome difficulties together. In addition to the government's strength, it is hoped that leaders from all sectors outside the government will unite to assist and鞭策 the government with social strength so that the government and the public can work together to create a new atmosphere and a new environment. He believes that this will definitely enable China and East Asia to overcome the critical juncture and move towards a bright future. Please express your opinions as much as possible. It should be known that the current government is not a warlord government, let alone a dictatorship government, or even a bureaucratic government, but the government of all the people, and the people should also take responsibility for this and work together.</p>
<p>Next, Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, stood up to express his views. In addition to expressing his gratitude to Minister Lin for his frankness and hope for the people's cooperation, he also raised issues such as the rapid establishment of a civil organ and the strengthening of the government, and strongly stated that the government should eliminate corruption and establish a good people's government. Minister Lin then explained in detail. Lin also quoted Chairman Wang's teachings, hoping that good people would stand up to take responsibility together, and bad people would naturally disappear. Now, the most important thing is to truly achieve the unity of the government and the public, and the cooperation of officials and people, and move towards the path of rejuvenation together. The meeting adjourned in a harmonious atmosphere at 6:30.</p>

<h3>Sea Launch of New Army Landing Craft: A Test Ride</h3>
<p>One morning, the new large landing craft of the Army Maritime Unit gathered in a certain port in Tokyo. Their formation was majestic and imposing. This was the first time! The roar of the engines echoed throughout the quiet port at dawn. Soon, with the commander's order to "Set sail," the lead boat carrying the reporter sped towards the sea, breaking the waves. The other boats followed in formation, heading towards the second port. A blast of hot air turned into a cool breeze, brushing against my chest, incredibly refreshing. Looking back, the boat had already passed the breakwater, and the port of departure had disappeared into the distant haze. The landing craft, resembling two small boats combined, cleaved through the azure waves with the speed of a celestial horse, the white waves parting to both sides. Numbers three, four, five... The beautiful azure-colored fleet, formed a long column, the last boat was far beyond the horizon. This army maritime unit wound forward, advancing in grand style.</p>
<p>Boat Captain Lieutenant Iwaki, his lips tightly sealed, gripped his binoculars, staring ahead. Two soldiers each stood guard at the bow and stern of the boat. The helmsman, tempered by maritime training, gripped the rudder with steely arms. From the boat captain down, all were warriors who had fought along the coast of New Guinea, some had even tasted torpedoes or sunk enemy submarines.</p>
<p>Originally an army unit, they were now active on the ocean. "What? We weren't used to it before! Watch us from now on!"</p>
<p>Although the boat captain didn't speak, he was filled with fighting spirit and confidence, looking as if he was saying, "Just watch what we can do!"</p>
<p>Equipped with anti-aircraft guns, rapid-fire cannons, heavy machine guns, and developed in parallel with aircraft research, it hardly needs iron. Using advanced shipbuilding technology, it is made of plywood, but its strength is no less than steel. It can carry large tanks and transport troops for landings in front of the enemy, moving at a high speed. This type of landing craft, rich in manufacturing materials and requiring little time for construction, is truly a wartime wonder!</p>
<p>Ah, mock enemy aircraft! They began circling overhead. Did they see the fleet? The soldiers on the boat quickly moved into action, the muzzles of all the boats turned towards the sky, firing a volley of shells, like a torrential rain. The mock enemy aircraft hastily retreated.</p>
<p>Twice, three times, the fleet repeated the intense training, finally reaching its predetermined destination port.</p>
<p>The reporter observed the army's new landing craft practicing various activities such as maritime positional warfare, landing operations in front of the enemy, and communications and transportation. He was deeply impressed by the elite army force operating at sea. After the test ride, he paid his respects to their health, bid farewell, and returned home. (Translated from the August 16th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>German Radio Wave Tactics</h3>
<p>Radio wave tactics are a powerful tool in modern strategic warfare. Germany utilizes ever-changing radio propaganda, achieving various strategic effects and posing significant threats to the enemy. At the same time, it is fully prepared to defend against the enemy's radio wave situation, building a "psychological air-raid shelter." The following is a brief introduction to the general situation of German radio wave tactics:</p>
<p>On the morning of September 1, 1939, the day Germany declared war on Poland, the German Propaganda Ministry and the Ministry of Defense held an emergency meeting and issued a "Foreign Broadcast Prohibition Order" at noon. The content was extremely strict, roughly stating: "In modern warfare, the enemy not only attacks with military force, but also uses every possible means to undermine our people's morale. Radio has great power, and the enemy's radio propaganda is all false and harmful to the German people. The German government is confident that the people are aware of the danger, and therefore earnestly hopes that the people will develop a sense of responsibility and absolutely avoid listening to foreign broadcasts. Anyone lacking this sense of responsibility will be subject to the following orders issued by the National Defense Committee:</p>
<p>Article 1: Listening to foreign broadcasts is prohibited, and violators will be punished. Minor offenses will result in the confiscation of the radio. Article 2: Disseminating news broadcast by foreign radio stations will also be punished. Serious offenses will be punishable by death." (Article 3 and below omitted).</p>
<p>Previously, when the Austrian and Czech issues arose, Germany not only permitted listening to foreign broadcasts, but even boasted of its calmness, saying, "The German people are generous and tolerant, and listen to foreign broadcasts with a critical attitude." Therefore, listening to shortwave was previously rewarded, but from then on it was strictly prohibited. When Germany and France signed an armistice, Germany allowed the French navy to continue to exist, but did not allow French broadcasts. Any French broadcaster who resisted would be subject to penalties greater than those for French soldiers resisting. This shows how significant and profound radio wave strategic propaganda is. It is said that there are 300 million radio listeners worldwide. Radio is a powerful weapon and propaganda tool because it can appeal to men, women, old, young, officials, and civilians alike.</p>
<p>Germany regards radio warfare as equally important as military operations, and therefore warns its citizens, "The vanguard of the attack in the last war was shelling, but now it has been changed to using radio waves to disrupt psychology. Foreign radio stations use German to broadcast day and night, attempting to frustrate the morale of the people. You have all understood this. The German people must always remain pure and not be contaminated and corrupted by the sinful words of foreigners. The people must each build a psychological air-raid shelter to prevent mental bombing."</p>
<p>Strategy in Music</p>
<p>Germany's radio offensive is very subtle. For example: In a certain family in London, the master is smoking a cigarette and the mistress is turning the knob of the radio. It is the end of dinner. Leaning back in their comfortable chairs, the couple are listening to the beautiful music of the orchestral piece "La Traviata." Suddenly, the performance stops, and a voice interjects: "Why did Armand abandon Violetta? Armand's immoral behavior is modeled after his uncle Chamberlain, the representative of the capitalist class, Prime Minister Chamberlain..." Although unpleasant, the tone is soft and revealing the evil of Chamberlain. After the voice ends, "La Traviata" continues to play. The couple exclaim "Ah!" and look at each other. The music is so beautiful that they listen to the end.</p>
<p>After this tune was played several times, the British people's faith in Prime Minister Chamberlain was imperceptibly weakened. However, its effect was not immediately concrete. Whenever Chamberlain addressed the nation, the question "What is that guy saying?" would always come up. It is extremely clever in alienating the people from their leaders.</p>
<p>The Victory of Radio Warfare</p>
<p>The effect of broadcasting was immediately seen in the Western Front. When the German army advanced into Paris, German radio stations broadcast to the residents around the city, saying, "German tanks and bombers are coming to attack, evacuate quickly." A panic ensued, countless refugees, carrying large amounts of luggage, blocked the roads, and flooded into the tunnels. At this time, the French reinforcements rushing to the front line were blocked by the refugees and could not proceed, thus causing a cause of failure.</p>
<p>Lord Haw-Haw was the most moving broadcaster on German radio. He spoke fluent English and broadcast to Britain, captivating the British people. Some even wrote to the British authorities, saying, "Please stop bombing Berlin around 9 o'clock, so as not to make it difficult to listen to Lord Haw-Haw's broadcast." He was so popular. The British thought that Lord Haw-Haw was also British, otherwise his English would not be so fluent. His broadcast was grand, for example, he once broadcast the following story:</p>
<p>"The Englishman Smith and the German Schmidt met in a hotel in Switzerland. They drank beer and laughed, and decided to avoid talking about the war and just chat. Therefore, Schmidt smilingly persuaded his opponent. Finally, Smith heard that the British government planned to redistribute poor children who had taken refuge from London to London families. He was furious and returned home in a hurry to oppose this violent policy of the government."</p>
<p>Moreover, Lord Haw-Haw also broadcast on the radio: "I ask the British naval authorities, where is the so-called safe warship?" When the British people heard this, they forced the naval authorities to announce whether the ship was safe. The authorities had no choice but to announce that a certain ship was patrolling the coast.</p>
<p>Mysterious Spy Network</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden once visited the French Maginot Line and held a formal lunch in Lille. Of course, this matter was kept strictly secret. But less than ten minutes after they were seated for lunch, at the time when the menu was being served, the German side had already broadcast this news to Britain. The British and French people were very surprised to hear this extremely secret news. The power of the German spy network can be imagined.</p>
<p>During the Polish campaign, German radio stations did not broadcast German propaganda, but only broadcast news that hundreds of British planes had arrived in Poland to provide assistance, and that Italy had joined the British and French sides. This was the fastest way to undermine the morale of the Polish people. They held inexplicable hope, but in fact this hope collapsed within a few hours.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, we will bomb London at nine o'clock tomorrow morning." After the German radio broadcast this, the German air force did indeed bomb London at this time the next day. This bold radio wave tactic made the enemy people both believe and fear German broadcasts. At the same time, it deliberately released incomplete war plans, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of preparation, the German air force exerted its great power. (Translated from the July 24th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Map of the European War Zone</h3>
<p>On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops launched an offensive, attempting to break into Warsaw from the northeast, but met with fierce German resistance. The German troops stationed in Slovakia used the Carpathian Mountains to build their last strong defense line. In northern France, the German troops adopted elastic tactics and continued to disengage towards the northeast, successively withdrawing from Lyon, Verdun, Reims, and A各地. The German garrison in Paris had also completed its mission, and a part of the American tank corps was approaching the French-Swiss border. In southern France, the war is progressing along the Rhone River towards Lyon. (Based on a map created by the Mainichi Shimbun on August 17)</p>

<h3>Night Crossing of Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Qikui</p>
<p>People heard the sound of the motor and went to their own boats as if returning home. The stone bridge and the harbor shore were crowded with a group of idle onlookers who seemed to be there specifically to see them off.</p>
<p>We passed through the boat and headed for the first coal cargo ship towed behind the steamer. We watched them being connected one by one. After the steamer let out a long echo, it shook and started moving. The stone bridge, the houses, and the harbor receded behind us, becoming smaller and smaller. The sky also darkened. The clock had already struck five.</p>
<p>The turbulent current widened. Looking out, all that could be seen was a vast expanse of seawater. A range of mountains slowly came into view.</p>
<p>In order to admire this tranquil evening scenery, I stood on the high point of the cabin, letting the unshielded wind blow from all directions. Looking around, the fatigue of the journey disappeared. I ecstatically comprehended the dusky twilight of Taihu Lake, letting my narrow heart fly into a realm of undisturbed peace.</p>
<p>"Look at that swimming dragon!"</p>
<p>Dark-skinned Jiang Jun pointed out a long string of towed boats behind me. From the one I was standing on, there were seven cargo ships all heavily loaded, moving forward as the steamer moved forward. Such a large ship was just a delicate and slender band on the vast lake surface. Seven sails, fully pregnant with wind, pitched and tossed, just like hunched-over old men in their twilight years.</p>
<p>"Do you dare to come with me to the last boat!"</p>
<p>I accepted the challenge. Following Jiang, I started out, jumping over the gaps between the stern and bow of each boat, completing a arduous journey to the last boat.</p>
<p>I was at the tail of the swimming dragon.</p>
<p>Dusk painted a cold pallor. The turbulent, churning waves turned dark and deep. To the east, a range of mountains stood like giants before me. The steep foot of the mountains, like two arms, seemed to be yearning to embrace this charming lake.</p>
<p>The "Zhuanfeng Xiang" incense stick on the bow was burning with a wisp of remaining smoke. The dark twilight of the night Taihu Lake gradually enveloped us. Having lived in the mountains for three months, I actually came to believe that it separated two worlds.</p>
<p>The monotone, desolate sound of the engine wheels puffed through the sky. Only it could comfort us, saying, "We are advancing towards our destination!" The boatman told chilling stories with a sorrowful tone. Looking around with wide eyes, the starless and moonless night sky seemed to press down, suffocating us.</p>
<p>Tang used firewood to make a tripod, pointing the only rifle at the dark mass of mountains that were approaching. He took off his military uniform, and the silhouette of the trees on the shore became in my imagination a brawny lake bandit.</p>
<p>The sound of the engine wheels was blocked by the mountain walls, and my hearing became heavy. The boatman said that this was West Mountain, famous for its abundant fruit and beautiful scenery. I could only think about why there was no moon tonight. If there were one, I would be willing to endure this windy and dewy lake night to nourish my long-ordinary body and desolate soul.</p>
<p>Two soft gunshots rang out from inside the steamer. Jiang said that it was Tu Mujiang's pistol. I said to Tang, who was lying down, "Fire!" A quick, ear-splitting sound exploded into the sky, and then a clear and crisp echo quickly resounded from the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The night wind was biting. I climbed into the bottom of the aft cabin. The sudden warmth made me throw myself down on the tar-smelling planks without hesitation. The monotonous sound of the wheels slowly closed my eyes.</p>
<p>In a haze, a few gunshots penetrated the cold air attacking from the deck, and I recoiled back. I decided to pass the night in sleep!</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, dim dawn light leaked in through the cracks. I heard a warm and gentle laugh, no longer the timid tones from before. I jumped out of the cabin in one motion.</p>
<p>When had we already sailed out of Taiyuan? When had we come alongside Xukou? A night of calm lake waves had passed horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>The tranquility of dawn unfolded. A red sun congratulated us on our safe journey, dyeing the clouds with its brilliant colors. The ripples of the micro-waves sang a lighthearted song:</p>
<p>"We have no surging waves or frightening storms, only an eager yearning for those traveling afar to return home!"</p>
<h3>A Cousin's Letter</h3>
<p>— Ruofan</p>
<p>The scorching sun hung high like a fiery umbrella, and no one wanted to go out on the street except for those who were struggling for a living. I wanted to discuss further education and career issues after graduation with my cousin, who had promised to come to my house yesterday, but she never showed up. Just as I was wondering, a burst of dog barking came from downstairs. Perhaps my cousin had arrived? I pushed open the window and looked into the courtyard, but I didn't see anyone coming in, not even a trace of a person.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, and Zheng Ma came in, handing me a letter. Ah, it was from my cousin:—</p>
<p>Dear Mo,</p>
<p>I envy you for still enjoying the happy life of a student. However, I am also very worried about you because you will be graduating from high school this year. Will you continue your studies next semester? I hope you will still go to school. Yesterday, I learned from Mom that you have the desire to find a job, which is commendable. Because you know that Uncle's burden is too heavy, and you want to share a part of it with your own strength. However, your personality is so strong, you don't know how to flatter, you don't know how to be hypocritical, you are unwilling to bow your head, you are frank and trusting of everything. How is this any different from me two years ago? However, in the past two years, this society, this real life, has suffocated me, crushed my will, and proved that my previous ideals were so naive! The world is definitely not as simple as you imagine. You say I am so happy! Spending all day with the little angels is the most pleasant thing! — "When you are in the garden, when the children find you, their joy and cheers, they rush into your arms like crazy, rush towards you, and surround you tightly. It's like a group of chicks sheltering under the wings of a hen. How glorious and great you are!" But what about now? I can no longer protect them; the devil has torn us apart! I'm telling you, I've been fired!</p>
<p>When you hear this news, you must be so surprised! You must be asking me why this is? Is there anything I did wrong? Yes, please don't be so shocked, it's very simple. I now know that I did do something wrong! I shouldn't have failed to flatter and please the principal and director, etc., or report the dynamics among the faculty to them; I shouldn't have worked so hard on the children's work, made demands on the school on their behalf, and caused jealousy among colleagues; I shouldn't have bonded with the children so closely, not only the group I was in charge of, but the whole school; I shouldn't have argued with the school authorities for the welfare of all the faculty and staff. … All of this is the reason I was fired. I know it deeply, especially the latter, the authorities harbor great resentment towards me. This is my own fault, who else can I ask? …</p>
<p>Mo, because of my experience, I advise you to study for a few more years! Because you are not like me, you still have Uncle, but I lost my father at a young age, and Mom raised me and gave me a few years of education. Now that she is old, and I have no siblings, the burden of life is pressing on me, and I have to take the path of finding a job. In the beginning, I thought that the academic world was a relatively noble profession for women, and I also liked being with children, feeling that only they were the purest and most lovable in the world. I thought that education was a job for the benefit of students, with children as the basis. But now I realize that the current education work is not like this. Teachers just teach by rote, and once they finish teaching the book, they are done. The most important thing is to connect with those in authority at the school, and to be able to understand the principal! Speaking of salary, I get 1,500 yuan per month, plus some government subsidies. (This semester, I only received February and March, only 140 yuan.) In order to make ends meet, I had to take on tutoring jobs after school, one at 500 yuan per month, and the other better, at 800 yuan per month, but I had to teach three children of different levels. By the time I got home, it was already past 8 pm, and I still had to grade the unfinished homework from school. All day long, I was like a machine, constantly teaching, lecturing, and grading. The reward I got was barely enough for three meals of porridge. For the month before the end of the semester, the price of rice soared, and the teachers, for the sake of their livelihoods, suggested collecting subsidies from the students' parents (there was also an official order at the time), but they were scolded by the school: "High-class beggars!" Under the principle of harming the school's reputation and hindering the number of students in the next semester, they silently gave up! In theory, we really shouldn't have charged the parents, because the parents paid all at once when they paid the fees. I remember that when school started, the price of rice was only around 300 yuan per dou. If we could get six months' salary at once, not to mention anything else, we could at least buy half a year's worth of rice, and the impact on our lives wouldn't be so great. However, the huge amount of money at the beginning of the semester didn't all go into Principal's pocket! They do business, speculate, make profits, and get rich, only we suffer. The 1,500 yuan at the beginning of the semester and the 1,500 yuan at the end of the semester are so different in value, but who cares about you!</p>
<p>Well, now I am unemployed, and I don't even have a job to go around in anymore. I know my mistakes, my faults, but it's too late; there's only a little bit of rice left in the rice jar. If I can't find a job this month, then I'll have to go back to the countryside with Mom. Although the countryside is not a good place, and I have to see the faces of my uncles, and they will also complain that Mom shouldn't have given the money she worked so hard to earn to a girl to study. If I had married a good family early, wouldn't I be enjoying myself? Well, ten years of struggle and hope have all vanished. Since I can't conquer the environment, then I have to succumb to it! Mo! You have hope. Work hard! Remember the words of a distant cousin, you should fight for the truth!</p>
<p>Wishing you a limitless future!</p>
<p>Your foolish sister, Minzhi</p>
<p>July 25th.</p>
<p>Reading my cousin's letter filled my heart with resentment and injustice. My cousin did nothing wrong. She is innocent! Are we just going to be sacrificed silently like this? No, there must be other teachers who have been fired for no reason like my cousin. As far as I know, the school my cousin worked at was not the only one that collected subsidies last semester. Teachers with the same fate, let's rise up and call for justice to society! Although I am a child who doesn't know the ways of the world, I want to encourage my cousin, and tell her that we all have hope! The real guilty ones are not her. Just as my cousin said, we must fight for the truth! I believe that the world will never be permanently blinded by darkness, and light will come one day. As long as we keep fighting! We young people cannot shrink back at the first setback. On the contrary, we must face it and conquer the environment! Transform the environment!</p>

<p>Today is not a day for us to cheer,</p>
<p>Nor is it a time for us to enjoy ourselves,</p>
<p>We should bury our heads and think quietly;</p>
<p>In this dark century,</p>
<p>There are many demons lurking around,</p>
<p>Quietly spying on us;</p>
<p>Waiting for our "relaxation".</p>
<p>We should gather up our remaining energy,</p>
<p>Arm ourselves with our "skin" and "brain",</p>
<p>To fight against the demons,</p>
<p>Until the moment of victory.</p>
<p>Who doesn't fear "sacrifice"?</p>
<p>But when the necessary minute arrives,</p>
<p>"Sacrifice" is the foundation of victory.</p>
<p>So I dare to boldly set a formula:</p>
<p>Necessary "sacrifice" is the prelude to "new life".</p>
<p>Pointless "shrinking" is the omen of "destruction".</p>

<h3>Returning from Visiting the Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sports Association hosted this year's All-Shanghai Chinese Men's and Women's Swimming Championships, which was held this Wednesday (30th) at the swimming pool of the Dongya Gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. It was the only formal swimming competition in Shanghai this season, and the reporter was happy to go and watch. The weather was hot that day, and the audience came one after another. The athletes were of course soaked in water, and the spectators were also sweating. From this, it can be seen that swimming is not unnoticed. The promoters lack the means to develop it. Since there is a lack of swimming pools, how can we criticize it much. Now, I will briefly describe the impressions I got that day, and the descriptions of the men's and women's champions.</p>
<p>Few Participants, Unsatisfactory Results</p>
<p>There were only 29 male and female athletes participating this time, and only four women, which was cold and deserted. Therefore, most of the competitions were finals. It took less than two hours from start to finish, which can be inferred. The results were very disappointing. Not to mention breaking new records, the difference from the old records was still far, so I can't help but sigh. Is this a major regression in swimming performance?</p>
<p>Both Men's and Women's Individual Champions are Seasoned Veterans</p>
<p>The men's individual overall champion was won jointly by Chen Yuquan and Xu Shouqiang, and the women's champion was Lin Meiling. These three players have long been famous in the swimming world, and they are all veterans. In the entire list of participants, only these three have a history, and the rest are newcomers. Initially, we were very hopeful that someone would surpass the old masters, but who would have thought that the result would be entirely the world of the three veterans? None of the newcomers could compete with them. Not only that, but several people's postures were completely out of shape. The decline of talent has reached such a point. The reason should be the lack of good guidance and overestimation of one's own abilities. However, the authorities should seek to improve. Only after the season is over, will it be ignored again? It shouldn't be the same as before, with nothing gained.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Men's and Women's Champions</h3>
<p>Lin Meiling</p>
<p>Miss Lin had already shown her talent in the Shanghai Open Championships four years ago, and she was praised for overwhelming the foreign woman Carla, who was a sensation at the time. Miss Lin is young. In recent years, she has lacked places to practice and lacked guidance. Otherwise, her current achievements may not necessarily let the mermaid surpass her. Lin has a strong physique, a nimble figure, and a very beautiful posture when swimming. This time, except for Huang Yuemei's slight competition with her in the 50-yard freestyle, few people competed with her in the other two events. This is an incidental reason for the poor results.</p>
<p>Chen Yuquan</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is a native, blessed with unique advantages, and his swimming skills have long been famous in Shanghai. However, Chen is old, similar to Li Tiansheng in football. This time, he joined because he did not expect such a lack of new talent, and he is still the champion. He can still dominate the 50-yard and 100-yard races. However, he inevitably ranked behind Xu Shouqiang in the 400-yard race, which shows that his endurance is not as good as others.</p>
<p>Xu Shouqiang</p>
<p>Mr. Xu is a veteran in the middle-aged and young swimming circle. He was originally a veteran, but this year he still has the opportunity to practice and be nurtured by a famous teacher (Liang Zhaoan is the national coach of Zhongqing), so his experience in performance is better than others, which can be seen at a glance. His flip turn in the 400-yard freestyle is not only beautiful in posture, like a shark emerging from the water, but also takes advantage of it. In one turn, he also gained four or five feet of lead, which is all due to experience. Mr. Xu is exceptionally attentive, and it will not be difficult for him to show his skills in the swimming world in the future. I hope Mr. Xu will encourage himself, and there is a long way to go.</p>
<p>Shan Tongquan</p>
<p>Mr. Shan is a talent in both water and land. He is the main player of the B team of the Dahua basketball team, the soul of the Tongshi softball team, and once represented the three provinces in football. This time, he only joined the fancy diving event, and he did not disappoint, winning first place. His performance of various fancy postures, such as the carp jumping and the friend spinning, made the audience applaud. Mr. Shan's other results are quite impressive. It is said that this time he only joined the diving event in order to concentrate his efforts.</p>
<h3>A Glance at the Poolside</h3>
<p>The preparation for this competition seemed short, so everything was messy, and the people in charge at the time were too busy to know what to do.</p>
<p>Miss Shen Xuanwang, the daughter of Shen Siliang, was the women's champion in the previous competition. Recently, due to poor health, she was unable to show her skills. However, she also came to visit that day, and thought that Lin Meiling's posture and Huang Yuemei's physique were very standard.</p>
<p>The older spectators preferred to look down from the upper floor. Because watching on the poolside downstairs, the water splashes everywhere, and you will suffer from being drenched.</p>
<p>Miss Lin Meiling was confident of winning the championship. Four or five of her sisters who came to cheer her on also thought they were helping her win the prize, but they did not expect to get only a small silver cup. Probably material resources were difficult, and they had no choice but to do so.</p>
<p>The judges for fancy diving were Ling Xitao, Liang Zhaoan, and Yu Binqi. Their scores sometimes differed greatly. Could it be that heroes see things differently?</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Jiazhen was the only female staff member, running around reporting records. She was very hardworking. Zhang is also a good swimmer.</p>
<h3>Main Players Withdraw, Pandas Lose to Portuguese Merchants, Still Hope to Win the Title if They Beat Pirates This Morning</h3>
<p>On the 27th of this month, Jiaozhou Park was suddenly crowded with people, creating an unprecedented spectacle for the summer ball game. It turned out that the Chinese softball team Panda was fiercely fighting against the Portuguese merchant Red team. Unfortunately, the Panda lost the game, losing by one to five. The thousands of fans present sighed in unison. However, both sides in this game have reached the highest level of performance, and the game was tense and heated. Now, I will briefly record the process and the reasons for the Chinese team's failure below:</p>
<p>Absence of Main Players Affects Strength</p>
<p>The only best hitter of the Chinese team, Wang Xiushan, did not play, and the offensive strength was greatly reduced. Originally, the Chinese team's hitting was already poor, and Wang's absence made it feel even more that there was no way to attack and no way to score. Since Mr. Wang has recently withdrawn due to some matter, the strength will definitely be affected in the future.</p>
<p>Weak Hitting, No Offensive Strategy</p>
<p>The weakness of the Panda is hitting. They dare to claim to be the best in Shanghai in terms of bases. In this game, the reporter expected that the Chinese team would have few chances to get on base, because the Chinese team is not good at hitting, which is one reason. The Portuguese team's Tang Bala's fat man's whirlwind pitching is another reason. However, the Chinese team cannot adapt and change flexibly, and use short bunts. Therefore, swinging the bat and catching the ball is just a waste of effort. If they can use short hits, "bumping" the ball next to the pitcher's fat man or along the first base line, then there will be more chances to score.</p>
<p>Pushing and Shoving is a Fatal Injury</p>
<p>The reason why the Chinese team lost this game was that there were the most mistakes in the first inning. The generals of the Chinese team were too calm in the face of the battle. Originally, each member of the softball team is in charge of his position, and does not compete with each other to catch high balls. Who knew that on this day, because they were competing with each other to catch high balls, they made each other think that the other party was catching the ball, and failed to catch the ball as many as twice. This allowed the Portuguese team to get on base easily, and caused them to lose points repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Team Hit the Ball with Ease</p>
<p>The Portuguese team's good hitting is the main reason. Each player is average, and the landing point of the ball is excellent. The Chinese team's outer wing could not use its skills. In the first inning, Oliveira and Fu En both hit the ball well to get on base. When it came to the team's soul Tang Bala to hit, the ball flew straight to the left outer wing, and went straight through the side line. This hit really laid the foundation for the victory. The two people on base all returned to base, and Bala got a home run (Home run). In this inning, the Chinese team lost three points in a row, so what can they do? After that, in the third and sixth innings, they lost two more points because of the Portuguese team's hitting and Bala's another wonderful hit, which was really impossible to save.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Team's Outer Wing Performed Well</p>
<p>Although the Chinese team did its best to hit, the balls hit out were all wonderfully caught by the Portuguese team's outer wing V. Su Ruo and Pan Lila, a total of five times. And they were all difficult to catch, otherwise, if they had missed the catch, the Chinese team would not have failed.</p>
<p>There is Still Hope for the Championship</p>
<p>Although the Panda lost this time, in addition to hitting worse than others, their luck was also too bad. However, in the current league situation, except for the Jews and Filipino Overseas Chinese B, which are not worth mentioning, among the other strong teams, except for the Panda, Xiqing, and Portuguese Merchants Red, which have each lost once, the Filipino Overseas Chinese A and Pirates have both lost twice. Therefore, the Chinese team still has hope for the championship. At 9:45 this morning, in the battle against the Pirates, if the Chinese team wins, then they will fight Xiqing next Sunday. If they win this battle again, then they will fight the Portuguese Merchant Red again to decide the championship. Therefore, the Chinese team must do its best to seek victory today, otherwise, there is no hope for the championship. Today's enemy team includes Fu Nike and the Sasi Jin brothers under Meng Zhu, and their strength is not weak. Even the strongest Portuguese Merchant Red suffered from their tricks because they underestimated the enemy, so the Chinese team should only be cautious in attacking.</p>
