<h3>社評　論人才的增產</h3>
<p>增加生產無論在戰時在平時是國家最重要的一件事。特別是大東亞戰爭時期，汪主席說過：「今年的一年，應該是增產運動總動員的一年。」但是增產不是空言所能達到，增產需要全國上下，脚踏實地，埋頭苦幹。增產的定義，據我們的意思，就是「利用人力，增加物力」，所以人力是增產問題的主要因素，而人才——有眞才實學的人才——更是這個主要因素中的最耍因素。</p>
<p>汪主席說過。「我們要保護生產力，增進生產力，培養生產力」。人才問題，亦是如此。對於已有的人才，我們要竭力愛護，誠心延用。對於已經延用的人才，我們要十分愛惜，使能增進效率。對於未來的新人才，我們要努力培養。</p>
<p>現在已有的人才是國家社會過去所培養的結果，是國家現在的精華。當局應該竭力愛護，更應該以十二分的誠意，立即延用。參加政府工作固好，參加社會工作也同樣的好。這裏面最要緊的只是一個「誠」字，古今中外，只有眞心誠意，方能解決一切人事問題。</p>
<p>業己延用的人才，希望加倍的努力，加倍的增進效能。當局應該「付以全權，律以全則」。有全權然後不受牽制，負全則然後不能推諉。事前的牽制和事後的推諉是過去行政上最大的弊病，這個弊病誤了無數國事，使從事政治的人分別不出是非，使國民對於政府發生一種惡劣的影象。現在是什麼時代，這個病症千萬不能再發生。</p>
<p>未來的新人才是國家的元氣，當局應該努力培養。培養新人才最重要的方法是有計劃的訓練。二十六年前中國的大學敎育和專門敎育相當發達，但是那時社會上有一種矛盾的現象，就是人才與事業不相應，一面人人求不到事，一面事事求不到人；因此國家每年費了許多鉅款，而國家不能得人才之用，眞是大大的浪費所以有計劃的訓練應該根據國家社會建設需要，規定程序，按步進行。要做到有一種工作，就準備一種人才，有一個人訓練成功，就有一個人的工作。當局應該有通盤的設計，政府和社會更應該有密切的聯絡和調整。現在是非常時期，我們更願意提出一個在業訓練方法，這是最簡捷而最有效的。這樣寓訓練於實習之中，使敎學做合一，對於理工科，行政管理科最為實際。學生們在實際參加工作之中，有實習的場所，有賢明的指導，其所得到的經騐，比僅僅憑口耳的講學，不知要增加多少。同時這樣訓練出來的新人才，立刻能够有工作，立刻能够替國家服務，所以有計劃的訓練新人才是培養新人才最緊要的重點。</p>
<p>以上所說，不過是幾個簡單的原則。我們鑒於增產年人才的需要，特別提出來，希望政府常局社會人士加以密切的注意，然後研究出詳細的方案</p>

<p>東京廿八日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電：敵機二十二架，二十七晨來襲馬當時，日軍地上砲火予以邀擊後，敵機即陷於混亂狀態，亂炸轟炸密林地帶後，即行遁去，是役日方毫無損害。按富時敵D40型機二架曾在空中相撞，二敵機均墜於密林地帶，由此次戰鬥而觀，在以數量來攻之敵空戰力中，可見敵戰鬥技術之劣抽。</p>
<h3>日駐華派遣軍　發表一週戰况　日空軍猛襲建甌機塲</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍廿八日發表一週戰况如次：日駐華派遣軍最近對渝共軍之掃蕩戰，益形活躍。其中於華北方面同東山西兩地渝共軍棄屍七八二。日軍鹵獲其槍械九，步槍五九六。日前於此地區續行　淸中。又日陸軍機隊廿四廿五兩日，日惡劣氣候，對渝美空軍預備於空襲日本土時，作為第一綫基地之建甌，予以猛襲，而將其飛機塲之滑行路，及附近之軍事設施炸毀，日機全部均安返基地。</p>

<h3>日醫院船　又遭襲擊</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電日醫院船吉野丸，二十六日上午二時三十分在南方第一綫海面向日軍基地航行時，曾被敵機轟炸，幸人員及船體未受損害，其時雖値夜半，但天氣極佳，視綫淸晰，同時該艦塗有醫院船之夜問標識，且點有航海燈而航行者，故此次敵機之轟炸，實為暴行，於此可明，敵對日醫院船之不法轟炸，今已達十餘次，敵方今後如仍不反省，再作此種非人道行為，則日方必將採取最後之手段，予以膺懲。</p>
<h3>視察華南公畢　谷大使返抵京　港粵等地情勢均良好</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　日大使館情報部今日發表：谷駐華大使為視察華南方面情况，前於一月十六日由南京出發，分別巡視廣東香港及台北等地。並在各地與中日軍當局，及民間有力人士，舉行懇談。同時視察當地實情等，玆以事畢，業於廿七日返此。</p>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　日駐華谷大使曾自本月十六日起赴華南方面作到任後之首次視察，頃已返京，於廿七日並發表談話如次：衣為適應中日關係之新階段，曾實施改革在華大使館，及領事館等之機構。此次為視察華南方面之諸般情勢，曾至廣州香港及台北等地，於廣州大使館事務所，為謀對華新政策之益趨發展，及中央方針之澈底滲透，曾召開華南關係地區之公館長會談，作種種協議。該方尤以廣東省政府與我方之協力關係，進行極為圓滑，此點買不勝喜悅。於香港已深感該地為大東亞共榮圈之縮圖，香港華僑下意上達之機構，成績極為良好，中日關係極為緊密，物資之配給狀態，除特殊物品外，其他均甚圓滑，强力發揮總督行政之力量。又會與各地之中日軍官首腦，及民問有力者懇談，檢討南方情勢。</p>

<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　據海通社訊：德外長里賓特　甫昨向記者發表談話稱：數年來美國力圖使阿根廷與軸心國絕交，賴米雷茲政府今竟屈服於美國壓力之下，犧牲本國之主權，以博取美國之好感，至於阿根廷所稱德國駐阿使館人員有參加間諜活動一節，則絕無其事</p>

<h3>松島艦隊報道部長　談海軍戰略　美海軍作戰違反原則</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日艦隊報道部松島部長，昨（二十八）日午後三時半，於艦隊報迫部四樓，會見中國新聞記者團時，就戰略上發表談話如左：</p>
<p>「二十七日重慶特別報告宣稱：於十九日在蕪湖西南貴地方面，日兵艦觸機雷沉沒死傷千餘人」。根據上項報告，吾人試想：能較千餘人之兵艦，其噸位定在萬噸以上，而在萬噸以上之兵艦，吾人絕不會用於該處，故其荒謬自屬可知。</p>
<p>空戰方面</p>
<p>日海軍戰鬥機之活躍，為世所共　，其戰鬥力亦着但無匹，所謂戰鬥力，乃指戰鬥機最要具備之三要素：　速力，　火力，　操縱力而言，對此戰鬥力之實况，觀以二十三日敵機空襲香港時我空軍以寡邀擊敵衆，結果擊落敵機四架之事，即可證明，其巾最主要之問題，為空軍人員，我方空軍人員，不但都能耐勞作戰，且均受極良好之訓練，故無論於　操縱——使楊身上下左右，調節速力及燃料，　偵察——　判斷，　戰門——射擊等，均能應付裕如，即於寒冷，空氣稀薄或氣候惡劣變化之上空，亦能發揮其戰鬥能力。我方旣有此優良戰機及空軍人員，在飛機數量上　極多，對美空軍將遭慘重之損失，自屬意中之事。</p>
<p>海戰方面</p>
<p>大凡海上作戰之目的在於擊　敵方之主力艦隊，但現在敵美所有之戰艦航空母艦等精銳部隊，都消耗於所羅門古爾勃特馬紹爾等島嶼方面作戰，對海戰之原則上，可謂本末顚倒，結果必自趨滅亡，過去美以其主力艦隊用於運輸及佔領島嶼之作戰上，已損失大半。據二十六日華盛頓電，美戰時生產局長陶納爾威爾遜氏發表於一九四三年美建造四萬五千噸之戰艦二艘，航空母艦十五艘，及其他兵艦若干，此項發表不過為掩飾其過去損失太大之宣傳。此項兵艦即　　補　以前美所捐之大半主力，但美若仍用之於佔領息嶼之作戰上，未免為　戰之浪費，並且找人對美建造大量兵艦，祝為無關重要。因海軍之戰鬥力為機力與人力之相乘價如圖：</p>
<p>海軍戰鬥力——人力（人數，技倆，精神力總和）×機力（艦船與兵器）</p>
<p>無論美對機力如何增產，但於人力方面，是絕對無法粗等並進。在日本一海軍大尉普通須經十年之過程，即一水兵，若能達於作戰，至少須經三年之訓練，因此美對人力夕補充實不可能，而其機力之　產，我人亦無　擔心。</p>
<p>拿破崙曾言：「戰爭最後之决定為人的　神力」，所以我人於大東亞戰爭中，確佔最後勝利是屬於我人。</p>

<h3>Editorial: On Increasing the Production of Talent</h3>
<p>Increasing production is of utmost importance to a nation, whether in wartime or peacetime. Especially during the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang Jingwei said, "This year should be a year of total mobilization for the production increase movement." However, increasing production cannot be achieved through empty words; it requires the entire nation, from top to bottom, to be grounded, practical, and diligently hardworking. In our opinion, the definition of increasing production is "utilizing human power to increase material resources." Therefore, human power is the primary factor in the issue of increasing production, and talent – individuals with genuine ability and practical knowledge – is the most crucial element within this primary factor.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Jingwei said, "We must protect productivity, enhance productivity, and cultivate productivity." The same applies to the issue of talent. For existing talent, we must make every effort to cherish them and sincerely employ them. For talent already employed, we must cherish them greatly and enable them to increase efficiency. For new talent in the future, we must strive to cultivate them.</p>
<p>The existing talent now is the result of past cultivation by the nation and society and represents the nation's current essence. The authorities should make every effort to cherish them and, with the utmost sincerity, immediately employ them. Participating in government work is good, and participating in social work is equally good. The most crucial thing here is sincerity. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, only with true sincerity can all personnel issues be resolved.</p>
<p>It is hoped that talent that has already been employed will redouble their efforts and redouble their increase in efficiency. The authorities should "grant full authority and regulate with full rules." With full authority, they will not be constrained; with full accountability, they cannot shirk responsibility. Prior constraints and subsequent shirking of responsibility are the greatest drawbacks of past administration. This drawback has harmed countless national affairs, made it impossible for those engaged in politics to distinguish between right and wrong, and created a negative image of the government in the minds of the people. What era is this now? This ailment must never be allowed to recur.</p>
<p>New talent in the future is the lifeblood of the nation, and the authorities should strive to cultivate them. The most important method for cultivating new talent is planned training. Twenty-six years ago, China's university education and specialized education were quite developed. However, there was a contradictory phenomenon in society at that time: talent and careers were mismatched. On the one hand, everyone could not find work; on the other hand, everything could not find people. Therefore, the nation spent huge sums of money every year, but the nation could not benefit from the use of talent, which was a great waste. Therefore, planned training should be based on the needs of national and social construction, specify procedures, and proceed step by step. The goal is to have a type of talent prepared for every job, and when one person is trained successfully, there is a job for that person. The authorities should have a comprehensive design, and the government and society should have close communication and coordination. Now is a critical period, and we would like to propose an on-the-job training method, which is the simplest and most effective. This integrates training into practice, combining teaching and doing. It is most practical for science, engineering, and administrative management. Students, while actually participating in work, have practical places and wise guidance. The experience they gain is far greater than that gained solely through lectures. At the same time, the new talent trained in this way can immediately have work and immediately serve the country. Therefore, planned training of new talent is the most important focus of cultivating new talent.</p>
<p>The above are just a few simple principles. In view of the need for talent in the year of increased production, we are specifically raising them, hoping that government authorities and social figures will pay close attention to them and then research detailed plans.</p>

The budget for the coming year will be sent to the House of Peers after it is passed by the plenary session on the 29th. The focus of this parliament has now shifted to the House of Peers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government's plenary session of the House of Peers on the 27th convened at 10:22 AM to deliberate on the agenda. At the 26th general budget meeting, it was decided that the supplementary bill for temporary military expenditures and the contract bill for extra-budgetary national debt burden should be reported by the eight budget committee chairmen on the examination process and results of the committee.

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese parliamentarian Seiichi Aoki, on the 27th, proposed to the Yokusankai Committee, on behalf of aspiring Diet members, to hold a Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, and hoped that the members would support it. The main points of the proposal are as follows: In view of the great achievements of the Greater East Asia Conference held last November, in order to realize the mutual assistance principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration through the national consciousness of the various countries of Greater East Asia, and to strongly promote the great undertaking of building Greater East Asia, it is hoped that the government will stipulate the holding of a Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference in the Greater East Asia construction policy. In order to realize this, a resolution with this aim will also be included in the final agenda of the parliament.</p>
<h3>Rabaul Suffered Four Air Raids, Over a Hundred Enemy Planes Shot Down; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Results of Various Battles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 28th: The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy Garrison engaged approximately 80 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul on the morning of January 24th. Twenty-four of them were shot down (eight unconfirmed). Aside from the sinking of two of our ships, there was no other damage. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy Garrison engaged approximately 200 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 26th, shooting down 67 (18 unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return, and there was some damage on land. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force engaged approximately 150 enemy aircraft that attacked Rabaul twice on the morning of the 27th, shooting down 31 (11 unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific: 22 enemy aircraft attacked Madang early on the 27th. After the Japanese army's ground fire engaged them, the enemy aircraft fell into disarray and randomly bombed the dense forest area before fleeing. The Japanese side suffered no damage in this battle. According to reports, two enemy D40-type aircraft collided in the air, and both enemy aircraft crashed in the dense forest area. From this battle, it can be seen that the enemy's combat technology is very poor in the air power that attacks with quantity.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Weekly Battle Situation; Japanese Air Force Attacks Jian'ou Airfield</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the weekly battle situation on the 28th as follows: The Japanese Dispatch Army in China's mopping-up operations against the Chongqing Communist Army are becoming increasingly active. Among them, in the North China area, 782 bodies of the Chongqing Communist Army were abandoned in the areas of Dongshan and Xishan. The Japanese army seized 9 firearms and 596 rifles. The "cleaning up" is continuing in this area. Furthermore, on the 24th and 25th, the Japanese army aircraft, despite the bad weather, launched a fierce attack on Jian'ou, which was prepared by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing as the first-line base for air raids on the Japanese mainland, and destroyed the runway and nearby military facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Four U.S. Planes Attacking Hong Kong Shot Down</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 26th (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Hong Kong on the 23rd with 24 fighter-bombers. The Japanese naval air force immediately engaged them, shooting down four (P40) type aircraft.</p>
<h3>Japanese Hospital Ship Attacked Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific, the Japanese hospital ship Yoshino Maru was bombed by enemy aircraft at 2:30 AM on the 26th while sailing towards a Japanese military base in the front line waters of the South. Fortunately, the personnel and hull were not damaged. Although it was midnight, the weather was excellent and the visibility was clear. At the same time, the ship was marked with the night identification of a hospital ship and was sailing with navigation lights. Therefore, this bombing by enemy aircraft was an atrocity. It is clear that the enemy's illegal bombing of Japanese hospital ships has now reached more than ten times. If the enemy continues not to reflect and commits this inhuman act again, the Japanese side will inevitably take the final means to punish them.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Southern China; Situation in Hong Kong and Guangdong is Good</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The information department of the Japanese Embassy announced today: Ambassador Gu, in order to inspect the situation in Southern China, departed from Nanjing on January 16th and inspected Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Taipei.

<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador Gu, who had gone to Southern China on his first inspection tour since taking office on the 16th of this month, has now returned to Nanjing. He also issued a statement on the 27th as follows: In order to adapt to the new stage of Sino-Japanese relations, we have implemented reforms in the embassy and consulates in China. This time, in order to inspect the various situations in Southern China, I went to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taipei. At the Guangzhou Embassy Office, in order to further develop the new policy towards China and thoroughly permeate the central policy, I convened a meeting of the heads of the offices in the South China region and made various agreements. In particular, the cooperative relationship between the Guangdong Provincial Government and our side is progressing extremely smoothly, which is a great pleasure. In Hong Kong, I deeply felt that the area is a microcosm of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The mechanism for the Chinese in Hong Kong to communicate their intentions to the higher levels is achieving very good results. The Sino-Japanese relationship is extremely close. The distribution of materials, except for special items, is generally smooth, and the power of the Governor's administration is strongly exerted. I also held talks with the heads of the Chinese and Japanese military officers and influential figures in the private sector to review the situation in the South.</p>

<h3>Under U.S. Pressure, Argentina Announces Severance of Relations with the Axis; Japanese and German Foreign Ministers Explain Their Views</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Argentine government announced at 10:00 AM on the 26th that it was severing relations with Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated his views this morning at the first subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives' budget committee in response to questions from Diet members regarding the Argentine government's severance of relations with the Axis powers. The gist is that the Imperial government's diplomatic policy towards neutral countries is to maintain and promote friendly relations with each neutral country. From this perspective, if the news that Argentina has severed relations with the Axis powers is indeed true, it is regrettable. However, it is also evidence that the enemy countries are illegally oppressing neutral countries, forcing them to join the Anti-Axis camp.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to the Havas News Agency, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday told reporters that for several years, the United States has been trying to get Argentina to sever relations with the Axis powers. The Ramirez government has now succumbed to U.S. pressure and sacrificed its national sovereignty to gain U.S. favor. As for Argentina's claim that German Embassy personnel in Argentina were involved in espionage activities, that is absolutely false.</p>
<h3>Spanish Embassy to Represent Japanese and German interests in Argentina</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires, Spain will henceforth be the country representing the interests of Japan and Germany in Argentina. The Argentine Minister of the Interior, Birgen, has already considered all necessary measures to maintain domestic security, and plans to take full precautionary measures near the Japanese and German embassies.</p>
<h3>Major Battle in the Leningrad Area; Expanding Southwest</h3>

<p>The China-Japan Aircraft Donation Soccer Charity Match, organized by the Xingya Patriotism Association, East United vs. West United, was postponed due to rain and held in Yiyuan on Sunday.

<h3>Matsushima Fleet Press Officer Discusses Naval Strategy: U.S. Naval Operations Violate Principles</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese fleet, met with a group of Chinese journalists at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 28th) on the fourth floor of the fleet's press department. He made the following remarks regarding strategy:</p>
<p>"The Chongqing Special Report on the 27th claimed that on the 19th, a Japanese warship struck a mine and sank southwest of Wuhu in the Guichi area, resulting in over a thousand casualties." Based on this report, we can imagine that a warship with over a thousand personnel would certainly be over 10,000 tons. We would never deploy a warship of that size in that location, so its absurdity is self-evident.</p>
<p>Air Combat Aspect</p>
<p>The activity of Japanese naval fighters is universally acknowledged, and their combat power is undeniably unmatched. Combat power refers to the three essential elements of a fighter plane: speed, firepower, and maneuverability. The reality of this combat power can be proven by the fact that when enemy planes attacked Hong Kong on the 23rd, our air force, with a smaller force, intercepted a larger enemy force and shot down four enemy planes. The most important issue is the air force personnel. Our air force personnel are not only able to endure hardship and fight, but they are also very well trained. Therefore, they can cope with ease in terms of: maneuvering – adjusting speed and fuel usage up, down, left, and right; reconnaissance – judgment; and combat – shooting. They can also demonstrate their combat abilities even in cold, thin air or in adverse weather conditions. Since we have such excellent fighter planes and air force personnel, and the number of planes is extremely large, it is only to be expected that the U.S. Air Force will suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>Naval Warfare Aspect</p>
<p>The purpose of naval warfare is generally to destroy the enemy's main fleet. However, the enemy's (American) elite forces, including battleships and aircraft carriers, are being depleted in operations around the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands. In terms of naval warfare principles, this can be said to be putting the cart before the horse, and the result will be self-destruction. In the past, the United States used its main fleet for transportation and island occupation operations, and has already lost most of it. According to a Washington dispatch on the 26th, the head of the U.S. War Production Board, Donald Nelson, announced that in 1943, the U.S. built two 45,000-ton battleships, fifteen aircraft carriers, and other warships. This announcement is merely propaganda to cover up their past excessive losses. These warships will simply replenish the majority of the main force previously lost by the U.S. However, if the U.S. continues to use them for island occupation operations, it would be a waste of war effort. Furthermore, it is unimportant to worry about the U.S. building a large number of warships, because the combat power of a navy is the product of machinery and human power, as shown in the diagram:</p>
<p>Naval Combat Power = Human Power (total number of people, skills, and spiritual strength) x Machinery Power (ships and weapons)</p>
<p>No matter how much the United States increases its machinery power, it is absolutely impossible to make crude progress in human power. In Japan, a naval lieutenant usually goes through a ten-year process. Even a sailor, to be able to fight, must undergo at least three years of training. Therefore, it is impossible for the U.S. to replenish its human power. We do not need to worry about its increased production of machinery power.</p>
<p>Napoleon once said: "The final decision in war is the spiritual strength of man." Therefore, we are certain that the final victory in the Greater East Asia War belongs to us.</p>
<h3>Spring Vacation Ends: Money Shops Reopen Today; Banks Resumed Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The general accounting for the 32nd year of the Republic of China has concluded. Following past practice, banks, money shops, and various industrial and commercial enterprises in this city took a spring vacation starting on the 25th of this month. Now that the vacation is over, all banks resumed operations yesterday (the 28th), and all money shops and various industrial and commercial firms will reopen for business today (the 29th). All remittance money shops and money changers will report to their respective trade associations at 9:00 AM this morning to enter the market for business. Those peers who do not intend to operate may also decide today.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Resumes Operations Today: The Huashang Securities Exchange, which suspended trading on the 20th of this month to conduct its final accounting, has now completed its vacation and is scheduled to resume operations today. However, since today is Saturday, only morning trading will be conducted. Regarding brokers' commissions, which were 0.0625 during the trial auction period, the exchange plans to increase them to 0.125. The brokers have requested to temporarily maintain the current rate and are currently negotiating. In addition, the exchange has allowed brokers to establish sales representatives (i.e., junior partners), stipulating that each broker may have five sales representatives. However, each sales representative must register with the exchange and obtain a business license. These sales representatives are not allowed to directly enter the market for trading. All transactions must be handled by the brokers.</p>
