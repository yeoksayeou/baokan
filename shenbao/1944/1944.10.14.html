<h3 id="c1">急待解決的社會問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>慈幼教養事業問題—　　目前急待解決的社會問題之中，我們從國家民族及社會未來利害着想，深覺慈幼教養事業比較最爲重要。我們眼看着彳亍在街頭巷尾的無告的苦兒們，看着他們哀號乞求，偷竊搶刦以及無聲地倒斃的種種現象，不只是爲眼前所見的感到難過，而且不得不爲我們下一代子弟的前途的國家社會，感到莫可名狀的焦急和悲痛！貧病遇弱，常此下去，前途眞是何堪設想！談到慈幼教養事業，在本市原不乏仁人志士們在埋頭苦幹，自中華慈幼協會的慈幼教養院乃至中外各界公私立教養機關，最著名而辦有成績的，不下三十個單位。然而，由於社會經濟蕭條，一面物價高漲，開支飛增，一面捐輸數量又形減少，結果不僅對於新產生的苦難兒童無法收容，就是已被救於的也有朝不保夕之勢。今日最主要最迫急的問題就在這裹。此外對於收容的苦兒，應該如何改善教養，如何爲社會國家培養出一批健全的幹部和優秀的人材，都是今日急須解決的問題。本報這次召開[慈幼教養座談會]的動機，就想集中本市實際致力於此的專家，對於上述問題獲得相當答案，同時藉此喚起社會方面的注意，以期共同努力，使本市的慈幼教養事業展開新的史頁。　　慈幼教養座談會討論的問題，集中於一苦兒教育之方針，教材與管理，二苦兒之生產與勞作訓練，三籌募經費及統一機構問題，四苦兒衛生與街童救濟問題。由於參加諸先生的熱烈發表意見，大體上都已獲得相當的結論，希望社會領袖及各界熱心人士，多多注意及之。（座談紀錄刋今日本報第三版）。我們覺得還有在這裹特別提出的，是以下幾點：　　第一，關於苦難兒童的教育問題，我們得認清，這是在苦難時期爲國家民族保持元氣培養人材的非常事業，具有光榮的積極的意義，與一般消極的慈善救濟截然不同，所以在原則上應該和國民教育完全一致，決不可隨便施教了事，這是一。但是，苦難兒童的習慣認識及體格都與普通兒童不同，因此在教育方法及教材方面，必須另謀相當辦法，本市土山灣孤兒院，鮑斯高各校及慈幼教養院等，在這一方面都有特殊的研究和成就，希望各機關團體毫無成見的互相借鏡，共同協力，研究改進，這是二。教材方面我們希望辦理慈幼事業有經騐有心得的專家，合作設計編著，同時希望本市幾位大出版家當仁不讓的予以協力，這是三。　　其次，關於苦難兒童保養問題，我們必須鄭重指出，旣然已經收容，就得完全負責，像自己的子女一樣親切地加以保育，本市不少慈幼教養機關的負責人及工作人員，常常爲苦兒的生活而流淚而奔走，寧可自己受苦，不願孩子們飢寒，這種精神，眞是令人感動。然而儼然以救濟者大恩小的態度，視苦兒如豕大　婢或依然爲小乞丐狀態者，也不是沒有，這是值得警惕者一。關於苦兒保育，除了無使凍餒，無使病疫傳染之外，還須特別注意德育及羣育，這一方面，本市各慈幼教育機關大都已能完善實現，尤以天主教基督教所辦者成績較佳，苦兒們心身健康，事實上高出一般家庭及學校的兒童，也確屬不少。總之我們不只是消極的救濟，而且積極的教養，使我們缺乏公德心，缺乏團結力，缺乏自治精神的國民劣根性，從根剷除，這是我們必須繼續努力者二。　　第三，關於枝術教育者，半工半讀，爲今日慈幼教養機關普遍採用的方式，這次座談會也有極寶貴的結論。我們在這裹所必須指出的，半工半讀，必須注意苦兒的身心兩方面相近者，善爲誘導，切不可採取我們手工業的封建壓迫方式及學徒制度，視苦兒爲奴婢，毫不體恤地役使他們。至於學藝的課目，也應善選對將來社會國家所迫切需要者，迷信、奢侈、消耗品的製造手工業，應盡力避免。並當努力從苦兒中提拔人材，就其天資所近，使攻專來，到了相當時期，保送到各專科學校，俾獲深造。在這裹，我們希望各專科學校，各大廠商，多多協力。總之，我們對於苦難兒童的技術教育，必須以爲國家社會培養各項建設人材爲宗旨，千萬不應該以供應小工商界變相奴役的[學徒]後備軍爲目標。　　但是，一切的一切今日所急待解決的，還是經費的接濟問題！我們要鄭重提出，上海大多數慈幼教養機關於組織是完善的，其中不乏抱着自我犧牲的社會服務精神而在埋頭苦幹的非常人材，可是，今日成千成萬的難童，依然流浪街頭；成千成萬的苦兒，雖已被救濟而仍徘徊於凍餒死亡綫上！我們迫急希望社會領袖們和各界有心人士，奮其大義，盡力支持，使本市的慈幼教養事業得以維持和開展，則國家社會幸甚！</p>
<h3 id="c2">日機在台灣東方夜襲敵機動部隊沉毀其航空母艦等計四艘 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日上午十一時十分發表：一日軍航空部隊十二日夜於台灣東方海面攻擊敵機動部隊，而夜半，對之反覆猛攻，日軍所獲戰果，迄現在判明者，計擊沉航空母艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，擊毀航空母艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，二日機有若干架未歸還。　　東京十三日中央社電　敵機會於十日前後四次以飛機累計約四百架，空襲日軍要綫西南各島後，邇後其不速企圖，愈行露骨，十二日更行深入日軍要綫，以優勢敵機，大舉空襲台灣，自上午七時起，即有空前多數之敵機動部隊艦載機，對日軍要綫來作波狀攻擊，至下午三時，台灣上空之熾烈空戰，仍在繼續，截至下午一時，判明空襲地區之勇戰結果，已擊落敵機約百架，其後之戰果及損害狀況，目下尚在調查中。按台灣日軍防空態勢，對此次敵機之來襲，已早在預料中，故於此次戰門中，對敵機之邀擊作戰，極顯示日軍防衛態勢之完整，來襲之敵機及敵機駕駛員，蒙受損害極大，其後之戰果，仍在繼續擴大中。料此次敵機之空襲台灣，乃爲遂行帛琉，摩鹿加各方面之作戰，並制壓菲律賓，伸爲奪取中國大陸反攻作戰之一環，以期侵擾日本本土與菲律賓方面之交通，並企圖摧毀西南各島及台灣附近各地日軍航空部隊之機動作戰力。且當此次來襲時，駐渝美空軍之一部，亦與東海上機動部隊之攻勢相呼應，前來轟炸，此足表明敵人今後自太平洋及中國大陸基地，展開聯合作戰之新動向，故極堪注目也。又此次引人注意者，即敵機除以西南各島之軍事設施爲轟炸目標外，同時，對於其他都市亦實施無差別之轟炸，當湖南作戰時，敵機會盲炸長沙及衡陽，致使無辜市民喪命，今又暴露其殘虐之獸行，蓋彼等欲擾亂日軍後方，以期獲得對日神經戰之戰果。又此次來襲之敵機，有多數漠視國際信義，而於其機身上塗有日本國旗之標幟，其戰法之卑鄙，實爲人所不齒。</p>
<h3 id="c3">敵機昨晨再襲台灣 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午三時三十分發表：一十二日空襲台灣各地之敵機累計達千一百架內外，被日軍擊落者約百十架。二敵機於十三日晨復又來襲台灣，至十二時頃尚在交戰中。　　東京十三日中央社電　敵機動部隊艦上機及駐渝美空軍，於十二日上午七時許侵入日本南部要綫台灣，實施分散空襲，經日機猛勇邀擊，被擊落一百十架，此次來襲之敵機，以艦載機爲主體，均由母艦補給燃料，往返轟炸，故實際數目僅不過爲三百架乃至四百架左右，其損失達總數之三分之一或四分之一，予敵美機動部隊之打擊至大，他方在海上炸沉航空母艦及艦型不詳者各一艘，炸傷航空母艦及艦型不誠者各一艘，敵美不顧損失，於十三日七時許再度作波狀轟炸，至正午與日機展開空戰，台灣官官民渾然一體，努力從事防空活動，被炸損害，因連續轟炸未經調查，但似極輕微。　　東京十三日中央社電　據台南電話，美戰鬥轟炸機之優勢聯合編隊，於十二日上午七時起，數度侵入台南上空，日空軍及防空砲火，當仰奮勇應戰，美機僅行盲炸與機槍射擊後，即倉惶遁去，日軍防空部隊乃加以追擊，與之展開熾烈空戰，至下午一時擊落其若干架，日方僅地上稍有損失，台南人民亦極平靜。</p>
<h3 id="c4">敵愈接近日本打擊亦愈大 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　尼米資機動部隊，十二日以艦載機羣攻擊台灣全島，此乃羅斯福於此次選舉前，爲迎合美國國民心理之冒險行動，而企圖奪還菲島。按過去二年餘之太平洋島嶼作戰中戰塲，始終在日本國防圈之外部，而此次美軍已侵入日本國防圈之內部，故戰局之急變與戰況之緊迫，乃係當然之理。且過去之戰塲，始終距日軍戰略基地遠去數千公里，故日軍於作戰上，係難免長途跋涉之困難，今兒美軍旣已接近日本國防圈之核心，日軍對此，自然不許其肆虐，如十二日敵空襲台灣之際，來襲敵機累計約千架，但於作戰中途，即已喪失百架，由此可知，敵軍愈接近日本之心臓部，其所受之打擊亦必大，此乃日本國民每人始終抱負之信念，以待決戰。</p>
<h3 id="c5">台灣已確立鞏固防禦態勢 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>長谷川總督發表談話　　東京十三日中央社電　台灣總督長谷川氏·於敵機來襲台灣後，即以滿腔自信，發表談話如次：敵機雖來襲台灣，然吾人已能迅速完成邀擊敵機之一切準備，台灣六百七十萬島民，頃已確立鞏固之防禦態勢，蓋台灣民衆早已料及敵機之來襲，甚至認爲敵人將在台灣發動登陸作戰也。本來台灣地域有本島人及高砂族混居，此外更有異族雜處其間，往昔各族間不時發生種種糾紛，惟近年來各族已成日本化，其以全力守備台灣之熱情，實與日人毫無差異，台灣自去年起，已急速建設飛機塲及各種基地，而台灣人對於此等軍事建設之努力，極堪重視·尤其階級之自覺，最堪崇敬。至關於高砂青年在新幾內亞，所羅門方面之功績，吾人今日實無贅言之必要，台灣展開如米砂糖等物資之甚充，洵足以永遠支持戰爭，且台灣人意志堅決，將極力守衛台灣，戰至最後一人而後已也。</p>

<p>南京十三日中央社電　日大東亞省竹內次官來華觀光，九日抵京，發表談話如次：問·此行印象使命如何？答·並無任何特殊使命，印象兩點：一街面清潔，二物價高昂。問·決勝階段應如何加強東亞各國間團結，大東亞戰爭爲東亞各國共同戰爭，應盡全力忍受痛苦，以完成之。談至團結或計劃，每一國家應努力本位工作，在統一思想領導下，自能團結。問·日本對大東亞施策，今後預定具體施策如何？答·日對大東亞施策，乃國家大方針體施策如何？答·日對大東亞施策，乃國家大方針，不能因內閣更易而改變，乃以團結大東亞民族之理想爲主，就大東亞宣言五綱領實行之。問·日之對華新政策，中國民衆尚希望日本更進一步表現，日政府今後之計劃如何？答·今後對華新政策施行，不僅爲日本問題，而有賴於中日兩國共同推進。日本自中國參戰以來，會交還租界，撤消治外法權，交還敵產，調整中日合辦公司等，尚有一點面中國諸君理解之，即現在乃參戰時非僅要共甘，而更要共苦，走完共苦之途程，始可達到同甘目的。</p>

<p>松島部長發表談話　　日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長於昨（十三）日下午二時半，在報道常會席上就最近太平洋戰局及英蘇之莫斯科會談，與美海軍對戰局之判斷，向本市中國新聞記者發表談話如次：</p>
<h3 id="c11">邀擊敵人此爲良機 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>最近在琉球方面，敵美機動部隊於十一日起，向台灣偷襲，敵方兵力約有數羣，連同大批敵機，經日本航空部隊於十一日以來，即對敵加以猛烈攻擊，目前正在激戰中，尤其在十二日夕夜，日本軍對敵之攻擊更趨猛烈，誠如日本大本營所發表之狀況，刻敵機動部隊中之一隊，已完全撲滅，其間有敵方主力航空母艦二艘，被擊沉擊破，尚有　型不詳者，被擊沉破者二艘，餘如敵之航空機，至十二日下午一時，已被擊落者達一百餘架，敵方此來之侵擊，乃敵攻菲律賓之前提作戰。我人可見過去敵放賽班島之情形，首攻琉璜島及小笠原羣島之情況無異。如此已見敵之兵力，約有航空母艦十餘艘，而敵美在太平洋之兵力已全數集中，可洞悉無遺，故此爲邀擊敵人之良好機會，今在南方之日本航空力量，亦已完全集中，因此，敵方對菲之前提作戰上，已遭受鉅大之損失，實爲敵方計劃之謬誤。查敵美向低估日本戰力，鑄成大劃，故對菲之企圖決難獲一綫之希望，不但毫無所得且已遭受最惡之厄運，目前戰勢已可觀出爲決戰狀態，今後之發展，當可期待，現日本之航空部隊，對塞班島之仇恨報復，不久即可實現矣。</p>

<p>關於英蘇過去之莫斯科會談情形，英首相邱吉爾偕同外長艾登及軍事首腦部防部莫斯科，與史太林之會談，頗饒深長意味。邱史之會談，會有種咱議論，稱政治重於軍事，尤對巴爾幹地中海之問題，及近東伊朗伊拉克之油田問題，認爲英蘇間最重要問題故邱首相親自訪蘇，足見其本心之焦躁異常。而據十一日華盛頓電稱，美國乘機有仰賴邱吉爾解決美蘇間困難問題之期待。惟全歐洲之重要問題，亦將在此次會談集中，恐不易解決，并將造成另一種之政治糾紛。</p>

<p>又據十一日華盛頓電，載海軍消息靈通人士所發表之美第三艦隊司令長官哈爾塞所稱之攻擊琉球企圖，其用意有可能性四點：一認爲有攻擊日本南端之九州之可能性，二窺探中國沿岸情形，三能窺探日本艦隊之所在地帶，四在掠奪菲律賓作戰之企圖前，以分散日本陸海空軍。但此項消息，不該發表，惟在九月廿五日美之戰時情報局所發表之太平洋狀況，以種種情形而觀，差異顯甚，我人殊認爲奇觀者，根據該靈通消息所稱，使日本水上艦隊無用，但日艦隊之是否有用，在最後即可明瞭。尤以彼輩對國內之生產力增大，以爲誇耀，但不知太平洋上的補給綫距離深長之不利也。我人對根據地與補給綫之重大，實爲重視，今後之美國應深認該點並對日本之戰略，亦可加以認識。總之敵美軍隊之向中國大陸侵入，在日本方面認爲極好機會。預料在聖誕節前，定可予以擊滅。</p>

<p>不久日軍進入丹竹縣城，美空軍每日約計四十餘架，連日來襲，盲炸機塲及其附近，死傷無辜何止千百。因此我等構築之機塲，不僅不能救吾國吾民，且成爲屠殺自身之器，時至今日吾人已深知美軍用心之毒狠矣。</p>

<p>— 武公</p>
<p>在戰時，任何地方都鬧着生活問題，尤其因爲我國經濟組織的落後，在這個非常時代便到處暴露其不合理的現象。記者此次到故都來，第一件事便是感到這裹生活程度的高漲，較諸兩年以前已有十五倍至二十倍之多。以前坐洋車或三輪車只要二三毛的，現在却非要五元左右不可。以前在公園裹吃茶不過化一兩塊錢已覺得太貴了，現在略進點心卻非要三四十元不可。至於吃館子那更是貴了，假定有五六個人就要超出五百元以外。所以當記者偶而走進中央公園或北海去的時候，總是覺得人庭冷落，遠非昔比了。總之，這裹消費的金錢數字，大槪和上海去年三四月的數字一樣。但是我們得注意，這是聯銀，所以即使消費的數字相同，合諸中儲劵也就數目可驚了。不過大體上說，這裹的生活還比目前上海便宜些，只有大米卻已賣到每斤二十元（現在已回跌至十六元至十八元），比較上海貴一些。</p>
<h3 id="c24">煤荒與火柴荒 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>在北京，近來也鬧着煤荒，每噸已超出了聯銀一千元之外，而且非有熟人還買不到。所以目前故都的主婦們，大都對這個問題發生恐慌。雖然市府當局今正設法運輸問題的解決，但是在未解決以前這正是此間一個大問題，因爲不久隆冬即屆，如果煤斤短少在這裹就不比上海，必然會造成絕大的不幸。除煤荒問題之外，這裹還感到一種恐慌，那就是火柴的奇缺，據說配給已脫期很久，外間市面上每一盒普通的安全火柴要五塊錢（而且還不易買到）。同時此間晚上電燈雖並無限制，但也採取着分區熄火的制度，所以北京城內每一地方總是每天有一小時滅電的，在滅電時間之內一般居民就不得不求諸碩物油燈的利用，因此在街頭上盡是些賣油燈的小販，而油類也就此漲價了。</p>
<h3 id="c25">食糧並不十分昂貴 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>現在我且把北京近日間的各物市價略記如下：食糧方面除大米頂好的賣十八元一斤外，其它如洋秈每斤十六元，小米每斤五元六角，玉米每斤四元，小米麵每斤四元六角，紅小麥每斤五元八角，麵粉每斤七元四角，以及伏地麵每斤七元。上述種種食糧價格一般而論並不見得十分昂貴，且與前些時間相較也許還便宜一點。據說以前大米會一度高漲到每斤二十四元，而麵粉每斤也達十元左右。食糧低價的原因不外有二：一華北本年小麥豐收，合作社及食糧公社對小麥之收買均獲有良好成績。二最近市府當局對市民配給辦理極爲迅速，且聞以後可以不再脫　，是以各項食糧均行跌價。　　這裹的食糧配給制度，今已以食糧公社爲主要機構。但關於各種主要物資的收買，則由華北合作社主持之（關於華北合作社的詳情，記者已在前次通訊中闡明）。我們在一年之前，會經聽說華北人民只配給到混合麵的風說，但自華北當局自本年改善配政之後，今已完全淌有這種現象了。所謂食糧公社即爲辦理北京天津青島三特別市及重要產業之民需配給，以及華北政委會直轄各機關之特殊配給的特殊法人。該社資本金暫定爲一億元，由華北政委會及民間團體各出半數。其主要事務可分爲四點：一收納主要食糧（注意此僅爲收納而非收買，因爲收買工作乃由合作社擔任，此乃與華中所謂米糧統制會不同之處），予以貯藏；二辦理主要食糧之配給，四運用資金等。又華北各省亦設立地方食糧公社，仿照中央食糧公社組成，資金爲一千萬元，辦理集散地收買物資之輸送，及物資之指定配給等事。</p>
<h3 id="c26">市民食糧配給手續 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>現在北京市普通市民食糧配給的手續大槪如下：每月由食糧公社按現存食糧決定每月配給食糧這種類及數量，作成提單交給市府經濟局轉交生活必需品配給總會，再到各倉庫去領運，而分配到各零售配給店去。至於配給票的發放，是先由市政府經濟局印就，交新民會市總會，再轉各坊里長發給各戶市民。按照過去的規定，大槪每月每人可配給麵粉十斤，其它雜糧二十斤。如果能按期如此，則居民的食糧供應大槪已可不成問題。但是爲了運輸問題，會常常脫期，日數量方面也很少達到這種理想。不過北京方面食糧配給雖有脫期或量不足困難，卻從沒有脫了期不算。譬如當記者到北京的時候，雖已是九月初，但八月份的食糧還未配給。不久還是補發，雖然在量的方面說，僅有麵粉十斤。但是這幾天內，記者又在報上看到配給九月份麵粉十五斤，雜糧五斤及食鹽一斤的消息，可知他們即使沒有配得足量的食糧，却也所差無幾了。據說，市府當局現正還在努力設法改善，俾以後在量的方面逐漸境加至足量爲止。</p>
<h3 id="c27">重要必需品價格 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>最近爲了種種謠言之故，北京市內各物會見飛漲，那時剛七爲記者抵達之時。所以初到時定到各同塲去看看，大有每日漲價之勢，市府當局乃於九月十六日與經濟局共同發出布告，取締囤積暴利。因此這數日內物價乃漸見穩定，而爲防止物資統出起見，經濟局更發表申請搬運許可書程序。茲特將近日重要必需物品價格加以一述，以便華中人士的參考：　貨　物　　　　　　　價格　（單位斤）　小白菜　　　　　　　　　　　○，五六　洋白菜　　　　　　　　　　　四，一七　荷香菜　　　　　　　　　　　二，四○　芹　菜　　　　　　　　　　　三，三二　青韮菜　　　　　　　　　　　二，八○　白蘿葡　　　　　　　　　　　五，二八　勾　葱　　　　　　　　　　　一，三九　土　豆　　　　　　　　　　　三，二○　老　葱　　　　　　　　　　　八，五○　毛　豆　　　　　　　　　　　一，六七　山　藥　　　　　　　　　　　六，二五　西紅杮　　　　　　　　　　　二，八四　芋　類　　　　　　　　　　　九，四五　白　菽　　　　　　　　　　　五，○○　茄　子　　　　　　　　　　　一，三四　黃　瓜　　（一條）　　　　　○，五○　蘋　果　　　　　　　　　　二四，○○　葡　萄　　　　　　　　　　一六，○○　桃　　　　　　　　　　　　一三，○○　煤　球　　（百市斤）　　　四五，○○　劈　柴　　（百市斤）　　一二○，○○　香　油　　　　　　　　　　三六，○○　花生油　　　　　　　　　　二八，○○　前門烟　　（每小盒）　　　一二，○○　麥秋烟　　（每小盒）　　　　四，○○　五福市布　（每市尺）　　　二一，○○　陰丹士林布（每市尺）　　　二六，○○　南苑棉花　（每市斤）　　　三二，○○　羊　肉　　（每市斤）　　　二八，○○　猪　肉　　（每市斤）　　　三二，○○　雞　子　　（每　個）　　　　一，六○　雞　　　　（每　隻）　　　三二，○○</p>

<p>本報鑒於近年上海各種慈善事業，因受物價影響，維持困難，以致救濟效率低落，爰於九月廿八日下午四時，假座工商聯誼會，舉行慈幼教養座談會，檢討改進方案。是日到各機關團體代表許紹珊，朱立德，童立凡，陸德紳，郁葉，胡迪民，勵天予，葉壽海，鄧振，管梅瑢，王知津，應永玉，林道亮，包月泉，施士珍，鍾志剛，汪琦，袁佩蓮，朱鋐雲，吞家傳，丁秉南，李瑞華，王鶴峰，歐彌額等四十餘人。由本報社會服務處主任黃警頑君主席，茲紀錄其要點如下：　　黃警頑：今天敝報召開慈幼教養座談會，承諸位惠然參加，不勝榮幸！尤以今晶適逢孔子二千四百五十九週年聖誔紀念日，孔聖一生以[汎愛衆]的精神，努力於[老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼]的事業，故雖經政治經濟等環境的變更，終不失爲萬世師表。本報今日召開本會，意義尤爲深長，今天諸位來賓，包括各機關，各團體，二十多單位，對於當前慈幼教養改進方案，高瞻遠矚，定有一番宏論，請各抒高見，幸甚！　　一苦兒教育之方針教材與管理　　黃警頑：兒童教育是一切教育的基礎，其重要性已無庸詳說。但是，在一般家庭的兒童，可以受到父母的愛護，過着快樂日子，教養成人。另有許多孤苦無告的兒童，由於不幸的環境，使這未來的主人，不能享受應享的權利，尤其在目前上海，因物價高漲，慈幼事業，不但發展不易，即維持也很勉強了。本報值此時艱，深感慈幼事業有重振的需要，特提出四大目標：一培育下代的優秀國民，二強化目前的慈幼機構，三實現戰時的苦幹精神，四提倡固有的人格教育，作爲慈幼運動的參考。現在請丁同志，將今夏兒童保障科主辦的夏令進修地的結論，報告出來。　　丁秉南：今天到會的夏令會同志很多，現在主席呌我報告，尚請諸位原諒，大會在結束的時候，共提出五件提案，就是：一請求設立苦童醫院，二請求增加特種配給的數量和種類，三此會對於兒童福利關係很大，希望以後能夠每年舉行，四關於優秀苦兒升學問題，希望設立技術學校，以適苦兒的需要，五對於出院學徒的苦兒，由於習慣的關係，第一不適合工廠中的環境，其次不能繼續受到薰陶，所以希望設立學徒宿舍。以上五點，希望在一年內能夠付之實現，還希望社會各界和與論界共同努力。　　李瑞華：苦兒教育和普通教育，若無分別，無論在理論上或在實施上，都是不合理的。一般慈幼機關，對貧兒孤兒施以普通的教育，其實是不對的，我們認爲至少應該使他們知道他們的環境是多麼的困苦，社會國家對他們的期望，比較普通富家兒童，尤其殷切，他們的責任是多麼的艱巨！關於教材方面，一般的讀本是不適合的，例如書本上圖畫中富麗的陳設或複雜的家庭，又如種種的稱呼，交際，來往等等，對於他們都是不感興趣的。相反地，他們需要苦幹的生活表現，和愛的團結生活，這些在普通教材上都不容易找到。所以夏令會中也提議過教材的編纂，終因紙張印刷的困難，不能實現。至於管理方面，慈幼教育應有家庭化的組織，以慈愛的精神爲中心，教員應認苦兒爲自己的子女，同時使苦兒也認教員如父母一樣，在這樣和愛的氣氛中，再施以知識或技能上的訓練，才能收效。訓練方法，我主張手腦並用，使一個慈幼機關，在一部份時間內爲一個學校，一部份時間內爲工塲，簡括地說，就是家庭化，學校化，工塲化，若三位一體，都能做到，才能達到眞正的目的。　　丁秉南：最近有一位有經騐的熱心教育家，批評多數教養院辦理的成績，不能滿意，主要的，就是因爲太注重表面，而忽視了苦兒教育的根本。許多苦兒在功課上，成績往往超過平堂兒童，但是由於缺乏職業訓練，一出教養院，就不能立足社會。所以苦兒教育，應注意一技之長，應有實用的合科社會需要的謀生技能，因爲苦兒畢業後的出路，優秀者固應使之繼續深造，大多數都以學徒爲出路，欲使他們能夠適應環境，在訓練的時候，就應特別注意。　　林道亮：本人的意見，以爲苦兒與普通的兒童，在本質上或秉賦上，並無多大的分別，一般慈幼教育家，太看重了[苦兒]與[常兒]的分別，結果反而使他們純潔的心上，受到刺激，其實是不合理的。他們的環境有缺陷，他們生活的背景不同，但教育者的責任，就是要彌補這種缺陷，而不應使這種缺陷顯著化。[苦兒]的背景，不如[常兒]，然而，他們的前途，也和[常兒]一樣光明遠大！　　應永玉：所以苦兒及常兒在教育的享受上，應該一律平等，不應有所歧視。爲了彌補苦兒的缺陷，我提議在教養院中的稱呼，應變更一下，不妨稱教員爲[爸爸][媽媽]，稱同學爲[兄弟姊妹]，使他們融融洩洩，如同有父母兄弟姊妹的家庭一樣。（以下轉入第四版）</p>

<p>（自第三版轉來）　　李瑞華：[苦兒]二字，其實並不含悔辱性的，正因爲[苦兒]和[常兒]，在本質上和秉賦上是一樣的，所以我們應使之有教育之機會，同時也正爲了他們的背景和環境上有缺陷，所以應該特別訓練他們刻苦的精神和適應的能力，譬如生活方式或教材，應特別強調這一點，使他們不致養成紈袴子弟的習慣。　　勵天予：在苦兒教養時，應有特別管理方法和教材，因爲沒有好的管理和教材，出院苦兒，容易做出不端之事，若然，不但教育的目的未達，而社會的希望和心血，一併付之流水，所以在知識與技術之外，應注重品性。　　鄧　振：苦兒教育之特點，在高小階段以上，尤其顯著。如一般兒童，在高小畢業之後，多是學徒。此外所收容之苦兒，由於年齡關係，如十五六歲之苦兒，若再受六年普通小學教育，結果也不大好，所以應該利用其特長之處，施以特殊的工藝訓練，使有謀生技能。　　工秉南：總之，這些苦兒——或者可稱爲團體兒童，應施以特殊訓練，這種訓練應注意二點：一應加強教師與兒童間的關係，養成融洽和煦的家庭空氣，二應參照年齡智力體力興趣各方面，施以技術訓練，使能適應環境。　　應永玉：我以爲同時更應一培養人格教育，二灌輸社會常識。　　二苦之生產及勞作訓練　　黃警頑：與苦兒出路最有關係的，莫如在院時，施以技能的訓練，所以生產及勞作訓練，可說是慈幼教養的中心。本市許多團體，對這方面辦理成績很好，然而也有許多團體，因爲經濟及設備的限制，不易發展，現在請各院工作人員多多報告，以作參攷。　　王鶴峯：苦兒教養可分三個時期：一基本教育時期，包括初小及高小教育。二學徒或技能教育時期，及高小以上或以年齡關係，不適初小教育者，應授以手工藝或機械之常識。三自立時期，苦兒雖已離院而入工廠就業，但仍應施以相當之指導，使在不良環境中，不致隨波逐流，沈湎墮落。其中最主要的生產訓練，在初期，雖不能直接生產，但如自己生活品之整理等輕便工作，應令學習。至學徒時期，除授以工作方法技術外，並應特別注重材料之節省，然後他們才能受社會之歡迎，畢業後一部份可留院任職。以上爲本人對勞作訓練之見解，及本院（土山灣孤兒院）辦理方法之梗槪。　　歐彌額：本校（鮑斯高孤兒院院長）對高小以上之苦兒，注重工藝訓練，採用工讀制度，一方面可以有一技之長，一方面收知行合一之效。所以上午讀書，教以初中課程，下午工作，如木工，竹工，雕刻，刺繡，縫紉，釘書等，初中以上，遴選程度較優，希望較厚者，繼續升學，餘者介紹入工廠商店就業，或授以高等工藝。而對技能訓練，務求適合個性，如有耐心者教以雕刻，心細者教以機械等是。在踏入社會之初，特別注意其道德知識，使不致誤入岐途。　　許紹珊：本校（上海基督教兒童教養院）也是以生活宗教化，思想科學化，行動紀律化爲主旨，而以半工半讀的方式，從事技術訓練，寓教育於工作，以空地闢爲小農塲，種蔬菜，養雞兎，餘如織襪，縫紉等工作，亦予以相當之訓練。　　三籌募經費及統一機構問題　　黃警頑：目前慈幼事業，困難重重，最要者在於經費缺乏，故欲解決困難，首在籌集經費，而如何喚起社會同情，實爲當前課題。其次由於事業本身缺乏組織，無統一機構，缺點自所難免，所以應加緊團結，以團體力量求取事功，故統一慈幼機構，實爲當前第二課題。　　許紹珊：經費困難之情形，因人才背景關係，各院不同，故籌募方式也各異，最要者在於成績之表現，使同情者不致灰心。同時缺乏統一組織，也是籌費困難之一原因，所以我們需要一個聯絡或顧問性質之機構，非僅監督而已，由此機構，可以在經費和人才方面，通盤計劃，再如目前最嚴重之配給問題，也可解決。過去救災團體聯合會，在兒童保障科領導之下，貢獻頗多，希望能夠加強起來，實事求是，不尚空言，造福苦兒。　　丁秉南：凡百事業必須有具體計劃和健全組織，上海各慈幼機關大都各自爲政，所以工作發展上免不了缺陷。但統一組織，必須以計劃爲前提，我們不需要大而無當，徒尚空言之組織，同時這樣龐雜的事業，也非今天一次兩次會議所能解決，在未實現之前，不妨請貴報發起組織委員會，徵求各方面意見，庶可提高效率。　　管梅瑢：各個個別團體，力量很小，若能由申報提倡，一定可以有良好成績。　　黃警頑：本報願以輿論立塲，儘力提倡，將來如能有一組織，很願參加一員。　　陳已生：目前慈幼事業之不能進展，在於各界缺乏聯繫，政府方面，對於福利事業，還未能實現到理想的程度，社會熱心人士與工作幹部無聯絡，以致有經濟力量者，無工作人才，有人才者無力量。故一方面希望貴報提倡，一方面原有組織，加強機構，務使慈幼事業，不僅成爲一院一團體的事業，而成爲整個社會事業。　　四苦兒衛生與街童救濟問題　　李瑞華：苦兒衛生首在營養，而營養主要在於食米，故希望當局增加特種配給，不但數量和種類要增加，質的方面尤需改善，其次兒童醫院之設立，殊感迫切。　　丁秉南：新設兒童醫院，也許在經費和物質上，非常困難。但據個人所知，上海兒童醫院，當初原意，本爲專救苦兒，除希望該院繼續替苦兒服務外，並望貴報竭力鼓吹，各醫院普設苦兒病房，廉費收容。一方面希望提倡領養制度，凡無子女的富裕家庭，歡迎領養苦兒。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Social Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Problem of Child Welfare and Education – Among the social problems urgently awaiting resolution today, we deeply feel that child welfare and education are of utmost importance, considering the future interests of the nation, its people, and society. We see helpless, suffering children wandering the streets and alleys, hear their cries for help, witness their thefts and robberies, and their silent deaths. This not only saddens us, but also fills us with indescribable anxiety and grief for the future of our younger generations, the nation, and society! Poverty, illness, and weakness will continue, and the future is truly unimaginable! Speaking of child welfare and education, there is no lack of benevolent people in this city who are working diligently. From the China Child Welfare Association's orphanage to various public and private educational institutions, both Chinese and foreign, there are no fewer than thirty well-known and successful organizations. However, due to the economic depression, rising prices and soaring expenses, and a decrease in donations, these organizations are unable to accommodate newly orphaned children, and even those already rescued face an uncertain future. This is the most important and pressing issue today. Furthermore, how to improve the education and upbringing of these rescued children, and how to cultivate a group of healthy cadres and outstanding talents for society and the nation are all urgent problems to be solved today. The motivation for this newspaper's [Symposium on Child Welfare and Education] is to gather experts in the city who are actively engaged in this field to find substantial answers to the aforementioned problems. At the same time, we hope to raise awareness in society and work together to usher in a new historical chapter in child welfare and education in this city. The issues discussed at the Symposium on Child Welfare and Education focused on: 1. The direction, curriculum, and management of education for suffering children; 2. Production and labor training for suffering children; 3. Fundraising and unified organization issues; 4. Hygiene and street child relief issues. Thanks to the enthusiastic opinions expressed by the participating gentlemen, substantial conclusions have been reached on most of these issues. We hope that social leaders and enthusiastic people from all walks of life will pay more attention to them. (The minutes of the symposium are published in today's third edition of this newspaper). We feel that the following points should be especially emphasized here: First, regarding the education of suffering children, we must recognize that this is an extraordinary undertaking to preserve vitality and cultivate talents for the nation during times of hardship, and it has glorious and positive significance. It is fundamentally different from general, passive charitable relief. Therefore, in principle, it should be completely consistent with national education, and should not be taught carelessly. This is one point. However, suffering children have different habits, knowledge, and physical conditions than ordinary children. Therefore, in terms of educational methods and materials, different methods must be sought. The Tushanwan Orphanage, the Bosco Schools, and the Orphanage of the Child Welfare Association in this city have special research and achievements in this area. It is hoped that all institutions and organizations will learn from each other without prejudice and work together to research and improve these methods. This is two. In terms of teaching materials, we hope that experts with experience and insights in running child welfare programs will cooperate to design and compile them. At the same time, we hope that several major publishers in this city will step forward and provide assistance. This is three. Secondly, regarding the maintenance of suffering children, we must solemnly point out that once they have been taken in, full responsibility must be taken for them, and they must be cared for as affectionately as one's own children. The responsible people and staff of many child welfare institutions in this city often shed tears and work tirelessly for the lives of suffering children, preferring to suffer themselves rather than let the children go hungry or cold. This spirit is truly moving. However, there are also those who adopt an attitude of great benefactors bestowing small favors, treating suffering children like pigs or slaves, or leaving them in a state of small beggars. This is something to be wary of. Regarding the care of suffering children, in addition to preventing them from freezing or starving and preventing the spread of disease, special attention must also be paid to moral and group education. In this regard, most child welfare institutions in this city have been able to achieve this well, especially those run by Catholics and Christians, which have achieved better results. The physical and mental health of the suffering children is actually better than that of children in general families and schools. In short, we are not only passively providing relief, but also actively providing education, so that we can eradicate from the root the inferior national characteristics of our people who lack public morality, unity, and a spirit of self-government. This is the second point that we must continue to strive for. Third, regarding technical education, a work-study program is a common method adopted by child welfare institutions today, and this symposium has also reached extremely valuable conclusions. What we must point out here is that in work-study programs, we must pay attention to the physical and mental conditions of the suffering children, guide them well, and never adopt the feudal and oppressive methods of our handicrafts industry and the apprentice system, treating the suffering children as slaves and exploiting them without sympathy. As for the subjects of study, we should also carefully select those that are urgently needed by society and the nation in the future, and avoid manufacturing handicrafts that are superstitious, luxurious, or wasteful. We should also strive to promote talents from among the suffering children, allowing them to specialize in areas that are close to their natural talents, and sending them to specialized schools at appropriate times to pursue further studies. In this regard, we hope that the specialized schools and major manufacturers will cooperate more. In short, our technical education for suffering children must be aimed at cultivating construction talents for the nation and society, and must never aim to supply the small industrial and commercial sectors with a reserve army of [apprentices] who are subjected to disguised slavery. However, the most urgent problem to be solved today is still the issue of financial assistance! We want to solemnly point out that most child welfare institutions in Shanghai are well-organized, and there are many extraordinary people who are embracing the spirit of self-sacrifice and social service and working diligently. However, tens of thousands of children in distress are still wandering the streets, and tens of thousands of suffering children, although rescued, are still hovering on the line of freezing, starvation, and death! We urgently hope that social leaders and caring people from all walks of life will rise to the occasion, do their best to support, and enable the child welfare and education cause in this city to be maintained and developed. Then the nation and society will be fortunate!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Planes Conduct Night Attack on Enemy Task Force East of Taiwan, Sinking Four Ships Including an Aircraft Carrier <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:10 AM on the 13th that on the night of the 12th, Japanese air units attacked an enemy task force in the sea east of Taiwan. They repeatedly attacked it throughout the night. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle are: one aircraft carrier sunk, one ship of unknown type sunk, one aircraft carrier damaged, and one ship of unknown type damaged. Several Japanese planes have not returned. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Around the 10th of this month, enemy planes, totaling approximately 400, conducted four air raids on key Japanese lines in the southwest islands. Subsequently, their reckless intentions became increasingly blatant. On the 12th, they further penetrated deep into the key Japanese lines, using a superior enemy force to launch a large-scale air raid on Taiwan. From 7:00 AM, an unprecedentedly large number of carrier-based planes from the enemy task force launched wave attacks on the key Japanese lines. As of 3:00 PM, the fierce air battle over Taiwan was still continuing. As of 1:00 PM, the confirmed results of the brave fighting in the raided areas were approximately 100 enemy planes shot down. The subsequent results of the battle and the extent of the damage are still under investigation. According to the Japanese army's air defense posture in Taiwan, the enemy planes' attack had long been anticipated. Therefore, in this battle, the Japanese army's interception operation against the enemy planes demonstrated the integrity of the Japanese defensive posture. The attacking enemy planes and enemy pilots suffered extremely heavy losses. The subsequent results of the battle are continuing to expand. It is believed that the enemy planes' air raid on Taiwan was aimed at carrying out operations in Palau and the Moluccas, suppressing the Philippines, and launching a counter-offensive to seize the Chinese mainland, with the aim of disrupting traffic between the Japanese mainland and the Philippines, and attempting to destroy the operational capabilities of the Japanese air force in the southwest islands and the vicinity of Taiwan. Furthermore, during this attack, a portion of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing also coordinated with the offensive of the task force in the East China Sea to carry out bombing raids. This is sufficient to show that the enemy is launching a new trend of joint operations from bases in the Pacific and mainland China. Therefore, it is worthy of close attention. Another notable point is that, in addition to targeting military facilities in the southwest islands for bombing, the enemy planes also carried out indiscriminate bombing of other cities. During the Hunan Campaign, enemy planes blindly bombed Changsha and Hengyang, resulting in the deaths of innocent civilians. Now, they have once again exposed their brutal and inhuman behavior, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear and achieve gains in the psychological warfare against Japan. Furthermore, many of the attacking enemy planes disregarded international ethics and painted the Japanese flag on their fuselages. Their despicable tactics are truly despised.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Enemy Planes Attack Taiwan Again Yesterday Morning <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 13th that: 1. Enemy planes attacking various parts of Taiwan on the 12th totaled approximately 1,100, of which approximately 110 were shot down by the Japanese army. 2. Enemy planes attacked Taiwan again on the morning of the 13th, and fighting was still underway at around 12:00 PM. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Carrier-based planes from the enemy task force and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing invaded Taiwan, a key Japanese line in the south, at approximately 7:00 AM on the 12th, and carried out dispersed air raids. After fierce interception by Japanese planes, 110 were shot down. The attacking enemy planes were mainly carrier-based planes, which were refueled by their carriers and bombed back and forth. Therefore, the actual number was only about 300 to 400. Their losses reached one-third or one-quarter of the total, dealing a major blow to the enemy's U.S. task force. Elsewhere, one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type were sunk at sea, and one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type were damaged. Disregarding losses, the enemy resumed wave bombing at approximately 7:00 AM on the 13th. At noon, they engaged in aerial combat with Japanese planes. The officials and civilians of Taiwan were united as one, working hard on air defense activities. The damage from the bombing has not been investigated due to the continuous bombing, but it appears to be very minor. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a phone call from Tainan, a superior joint formation of American fighter-bombers invaded the airspace over Tainan several times starting at 7:00 AM on the 12th. The Japanese air force and anti-aircraft fire fought bravely in response. The American planes only carried out blind bombing and machine gun fire before fleeing in panic. The Japanese air defense forces pursued them and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down several of them by 1:00 PM. The Japanese side only suffered minor ground losses, and the people of Tainan were also very calm.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Closer the Enemy Gets to Japan, the Greater the Blow They Will Suffer <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The attack on the entire island of Taiwan on the 12th by carrier-based aircraft from Nimitz's task force was an adventurous move by Roosevelt to cater to the psychology of the American people before the upcoming election, and an attempt to recapture the Philippines. In the past two years of island warfare in the Pacific, the battlefield has always been outside the Japanese defense zone. Now that the American military has invaded the interior of the Japanese defense zone, the sudden change in the war situation and the urgency of the battle are only natural. Furthermore, in the past, the battlefields were always thousands of kilometers away from the Japanese strategic bases. Therefore, the Japanese army inevitably faced the difficulty of long-distance travel in its operations. Now that the American military has approached the core of the Japanese defense zone, the Japanese army will naturally not allow them to wreak havoc. For example, during the enemy air raid on Taiwan on the 12th, the attacking enemy planes totaled approximately 1,000, but 100 were lost in the middle of the operation. From this, it can be seen that the closer the enemy gets to the heart of Japan, the greater the blow they will suffer. This is the belief that every Japanese citizen has always held, awaiting the decisive battle.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Taiwan Has Established a Solid Defense Posture <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Governor-General Hasegawa Issues Statement Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy planes attacked Taiwan, Governor-General Hasegawa issued a statement full of confidence, as follows: Although enemy planes have attacked Taiwan, we have been able to quickly complete all preparations to intercept them. The 6.7 million islanders of Taiwan have now established a solid defense posture. The people of Taiwan have long anticipated the enemy planes' attack, and even believe that the enemy will launch a landing operation on Taiwan. Originally, the Taiwan region is inhabited by Taiwanese and Gaoshan people, as well as other ethnic groups. In the past, various disputes often occurred between the ethnic groups. However, in recent years, all ethnic groups have become Japanized, and their enthusiasm for defending Taiwan with all their strength is no different from that of the Japanese. Since last year, Taiwan has been rapidly constructing airfields and various bases, and the efforts of the Taiwanese in these military constructions are highly valued, especially their awareness of class, which is most admirable. As for the achievements of the Gaoshan youth in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there is no need for me to say more today. Taiwan's abundant supply of materials such as rice and sugar is sufficient to support the war forever. Furthermore, the Taiwanese people are determined to defend Taiwan to the last person.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Local Leaders of Korea and Taiwan to Hold Talks <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Koiso stated in the 85th extraordinary Diet that he would consider measures regarding the people of Korea and Taiwan. In order to promote the fulfillment of the Prime Minister's statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs plans to hold a meeting of local leaders in the near future. Governor-General Hasegawa of Taiwan, who is currently in Tokyo, Endo, the Director-General of Political Affairs of Korea, who recently arrived in Tokyo, Minister Oura of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Parliamentary Vice-Minister Takechi, Administrative Vice-Minister Yamazaki, and other leaders will all attend.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Vice-Minister Takeuchi Answers Reporters' Questions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – Takeuchi, the Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, arrived in Nanjing on the 9th for a sightseeing tour and made the following remarks: Question: What is the impression and mission of this trip? Answer: There is no special mission. Two points of impression: 1. The streets are clean, and 2. Prices are high. Question: How should we strengthen the solidarity among the countries of East Asia in the decisive stage? The Greater East Asia War is a common war for all countries in East Asia. We should do our best to endure suffering in order to complete it. When it comes to solidarity or planning, each country should work hard at its own job. Under unified ideological leadership, we can unite. Question: What are Japan's specific policies for Greater East Asia in the future? Answer: Japan's policies for Greater East Asia are a national policy. It cannot be changed due to changes in the cabinet. It is based on the ideal of uniting the nations of Greater East Asia and implementing the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Question: The Chinese people still hope that Japan will further express its new policy towards China. What are the Japanese government's plans for the future? Answer: The implementation of the new policy towards China in the future is not only a problem for Japan, but also depends on the joint promotion of China and Japan. Since China joined the war, it has returned concessions, abolished extraterritorial rights, returned enemy property, and adjusted Sino-Japanese joint ventures. There is one more point that I hope my Chinese friends will understand, that is, now is the time of war, and we must not only share the sweets, but also share the hardships. Only by completing the journey of sharing the hardships can we achieve the goal of sharing the sweets.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Japanese military base in the southwestern Pacific, elite Japanese air units launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Hollandia, New Guinea, on the night of the 8th, destroying both the east and west runways and heavily damaging approximately 400 American planes concentrated there. The Japanese planes returned safely to their base.</p>

<p>Department Chief Matsushima Issues Statement At 2:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), Department Chief Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China gave a statement at the regular press conference to the Chinese news reporters in the city regarding the recent Pacific war situation, the British-Soviet Moscow talks, and the U.S. Navy's judgment of the war situation, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e11">A Good Opportunity to Intercept the Enemy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the Ryukyu Islands, the enemy's U.S. task force launched a surprise attack on Taiwan starting on the 11th. The enemy's forces consisted of several groups, along with a large number of enemy planes. Since the 11th, the Japanese air force has launched a fierce attack on the enemy and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. Especially on the evening of the 12th, the Japanese military's attack on the enemy became even more fierce. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, one of the enemy task forces has been completely annihilated. Among them, two of the enemy's main aircraft carriers were sunk and damaged, and two ships of unknown type were sunk and damaged. As for the enemy's aircraft, as of 1:00 PM on the 12th, more than 100 had been shot down. The enemy's attack was a preliminary operation for their attack on the Philippines. We can see that this is no different from the enemy's attack on Saipan and the situation on Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's forces consist of approximately ten aircraft carriers, and the enemy's U.S. forces in the Pacific have been completely concentrated. Therefore, this is a good opportunity to intercept the enemy. Now, the Japanese air power in the south has also been completely concentrated. Therefore, the enemy has suffered huge losses in their preliminary operation against the Philippines, which is a mistake in the enemy's plan. After all, the enemy's U.S. military underestimated Japan's war capability and made a major mistake. Therefore, the attempt to get the Philippines will be difficult to get a line of hope, not only nothing gained but has suffered the most evil of misfortune, the current war situation can be seen as the decisive battle. The development in the future can be expected. Now, the Japanese air force's revenge for Saipan will soon be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Many Disputes in the British-Soviet Talks <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the situation of the past Moscow talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden and the military leadership, visited Moscow for talks with Stalin, which were of great significance. The Churchill-Stalin talks had various discussions, calling politics more important than military affairs, especially on the problems of the Balkans and the Mediterranean Sea, and the oil fields in the Near East, Iran, and Iraq, which are considered the most important problems between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British Prime Minister personally visited the Soviet Union, which shows his anxiety. According to an 11th Washington telegram, the United States took the opportunity to expect Churchill to solve the difficult problems between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the important problems of the entire Europe will also be concentrated in this meeting, and it is difficult to solve them, and will cause another kind of political dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Annihilate the Enemy Before Christmas <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>According to an 11th Washington telegram, which carried the remarks of the U.S. Third Fleet Commander Halsey, a well-informed naval source, the intentions of the attack on the Ryukyu Islands may be four possibilities: First, it is considered that there is a possibility of attacking Kyushu, the southern end of Japan; second, it probes the situation on the Chinese coast; third, it can probe the location of the Japanese fleet; fourth, before the attempt to plunder the Philippines, it disperses the Japanese army, navy, and air force. However, this information should not be published. Only the Pacific situation published by the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau on September 25 shows significant differences in various situations. We find it strange. According to the so-called well-informed sources, the Japanese surface fleet is useless, but whether the Japanese fleet is useful can be clarified at the end. In particular, they boasted about the increase in domestic productivity, but they did not know the disadvantage of the long supply line in the Pacific. We attach great importance to the base and supply line. In the future, the United States should deeply recognize this point and also recognize Japan's strategy. In short, Japan believes that it is an excellent opportunity for the enemy's U.S. forces to invade mainland China. It is expected that they can be annihilated before Christmas.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – October 14th is the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of the Philippines. The newly independent Philippines is the second independent country born after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, following Burma. In this year, it has actively implemented various measures. Today, the Philippines is completely different from when it was founded, and it is gradually forming the posture of a new country. The most significant construction is especially the return of the Greater East Asia spirit. For about 50 years since 1898, under the rule of the United States, it has been poisoned by the material civilization of the United States, and gradually lost the original face of the Oriental. Since independence, 18 million people have first realized this, and under the leadership of President Laurel, they have made every effort to restore the original posture of the Philippines in East Asia. The declaration of war on Britain and the United States on September 23 is the crystallization of their efforts. During this period, the Republic of the Philippines has established the prestige of the government within and outside the country in the political aspect, reorganized the industry in the economic aspect, aiming to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency, and tried to eliminate the material poison of the United States in the cultural aspect. During this first year of entrepreneurship, various constructions have achieved results. Japan, based on the spirit of the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, spared no effort to provide various kinds of assistance to seek the healthy development of the Republic of the Philippines. Japan lent the Philippines a credit loan of 200 million yuan on the 11th of this month, which is the expression of Japan's friendship. On the 14th, Manila, the capital of the Philippines, will solemnly hold a commemorative ceremony with profound significance. At the same time, Ambassador Vargas of the Philippines in Tokyo will also hold a dinner party at the Imperial Hotel at 2:00 PM that day. At that time, Prime Minister Koiso and Japanese celebrities from all walks of life will attend, writing blessings for the future of the Republic of the Philippines. From 7:20 PM, Prime Minister Koiso and President Laurel will broadcast speeches to each other, expressing their wishes to each other. At the same time, the countries of East Asia will also express their congratulations. At that time, Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman of China, Zhang Jinghui of Manchuria, Prime Minister Abha Wihan of Thailand, and Ba Maw, a representative of Burma, will also broadcast congratulations respectively.</p>

The people are convinced that to maintain freedom and independence, the greatest sacrifice must be made. Looking back on the past year, there has been obvious progress in spirit and thought. We deeply feel that the Philippines should have strong unity. In order to realize eternal freedom, we should recognize and fulfill the important task we bear in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The hardships and trials of our people are not yet over. How we work hard can determine our independence. Future crises can prove the overflowing courage and patriotism of our people.]</p>

<p>Incessant Air Raids Cause Casualties Among the Innocent; Joint Telegram to Chiang in Chongqing Urges Consideration of Humanity</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The US Air Force squadrons stationed in Chongqing frequently intrude into the city at night, flying low over densely populated central areas, indiscriminately bombing civilian houses, hospitals, schools, and shops, destroying buildings and causing many casualties among innocent civilians. Such atrocities not only violate international law but also extinguish humanity, arousing indignation among both gods and men. The Guangzhou Convenient Hospital, Ai Yu Shantang, Hui Xing Liangtang, Guangji Hospital, Si Miao Shantang, Zun Chun Shantang, Run Shen Shanshe and other charitable organizations in this city have jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Zhesheng, Wang Liangchou, Wu Tiecheng, Liang Junmo, and Chen Shuren in Chongqing, urging them to find ways to stop such atrocities by American aircraft in order to uphold humanity.</p>
<p>Exposing the Atrocities of the Chongqing-Based US Air Force</p>
<p>Japanese Front Line, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Due to the atrocities of the Chongqing-based US Air Force, anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people is growing stronger day by day. An elderly man who has lived in Danzhu for fifty-eight years revealed the brutal situation of the Chongqing-based US Air Force as follows: Construction of the airfield here began in April of last year and was completed in August. During that time, all those aged ten to sixty were forcibly conscripted and supervised by armed soldiers. They worked an average of more than ten hours a day without rest, receiving only two meals a day, treated like cattle and horses. Regardless of the weather, they slept outdoors at night. After the airfield was completed, they were given very little pay and sent back to their villages. However, we all believed that this airfield, built with the blood and sweat of the people, was built to save the country and its people, but the reality was not so. American soldiers bought things without paying a cent, molested women, and acted recklessly. Even local officials could not cope with this situation. Later, when the Japanese military launched a fierce attack on the US Air Force, it completely withdrew on September 6. At the same time, the county government ordered a forced evacuation, but some people ultimately did not obey the order. On September 10, the US Air Force suddenly appeared over Danzhu, repeatedly strafing with machine guns, causing many casualties. Subsequently, American aircraft continuously bombed the people who had not been able to escape. Before long, the Japanese military entered Danzhu County. American aircraft, about forty or so each day, raided indiscriminately, bombing the airfield and its vicinity, causing countless innocent deaths and injuries. Therefore, the airfield we built not only failed to save our country and its people but became an instrument for slaughtering ourselves. Today, we deeply understand the sinister intentions of the American military.</p>

<p>Fierce Battles Break Out in Southern Hungary</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Western Front: The fierce fighting centered on Aachen, the key point of the second line of the Siegfried Line, has intensified as the German army refuses to surrender. According to United Press frontline reports, US infantry units are now approaching the city of Aachen and are providing air cover for the troops, raining bombs on them while also bombarding them with heavy artillery. However, the damage suffered by the anti-Axis forces is great, and the vicinity of Aachen has become a scene of carnage, a mountain of corpses and a river of blood. The US forces east of the city seem to have made some progress, but the US forces north of the city have failed to resist the German counterattack and have retreated. The German army is resolutely defending Aachen under enemy encirclement, with high morale, which is admirable. Field Marshal Rundstedt, commander of the German Western Army, issued a proclamation to all officers and soldiers on the 12th, as follows: Our troops have kept the anti-Axis forces bogged down outside the German homeland defense line. The enemy will launch a large-scale new offensive, but because of our army's indomitable resistance, the enemy's attempt to break into the German homeland will surely fail. The German Supreme Headquarters also announced the battle situation in other areas of the West as follows: Fierce fighting has continued for several days at the bridgehead south of the Western Scheldt in the Netherlands. Anti-Axis forces landed east of Breskens, but were heavily damaged by German artillery fire. Anti-Axis forces in the front-line area east of Épinal attempted a limited attack under the cover of tank units, but were immediately repulsed. V-1 missiles continue to bomb London. Eastern Front: Fighting remains intense near the border of East Prussia. Fierce fighting continues north of Memel and Tilsit. When the Soviet army approached a few kilometers from the city of Memel, it continued to advance into the southern border of East Prussia from northern Poland. Balkan Front: The Soviet army continues to attack Belgrade. The Soviet army launched a formal offensive in southern Hungary, and fierce fighting is taking place everywhere. There are no new developments on the Italian front today.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Small Countries Dissatisfied with Anti-Axis Alliance Plan <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Regarding the reaction after the announcement of the Anti-Axis Alliance plan, the most noteworthy is the opposition from small countries within the Axis and anti-Axis camps. In addition, the indifferent attitude of the British and American parliaments and opinion circles is also extremely noteworthy. The greatest feature of the new alliance plan is that, in view of the failure of the old League of Nations in the past due to the lack of a strong background, this time it is backed by military force, and the Security Council, organized by major powers, is given special powers. As a result, the new alliance has become a mechanism monopolized by major powers. Because the alliance plan adopts a general assembly system, it flaunts the words "equality of sovereignty," but this is only nominal, so small countries are extremely dissatisfied with this point. What should be clearly stated here is that there are still inconsistencies in the opinions of the four countries in their joint statement. The conflicting opinions are between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. The point of conflict is the voting method of the Council (which is the core of the new alliance plan). The exercise of voting rights is premised on the use of force, so it becomes an extremely important and delicate key point in the alliance's structure. On this point, the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not been consistent, and the entire new alliance plan may be aborted. According to the alliance's initiators, the United Kingdom and the United States, both countries support it with the greatest strength, but the most negative attitude has also appeared on the part of the United Kingdom and the United States, which is quite eye-catching. For example, the London radio station expressed its views on the new alliance plan, saying, "Let us not forget that the new alliance plan is just a simple proposal."</p>
<h3 id="e22">Soviet-Polish Disputes May Be Resolved <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the representatives of the Polish Committee of National Liberation arrived in Moscow, Prime Minister Mikołajczyk of the Polish government-in-exile also arrived there. This trip to Moscow for talks clearly focuses on the Soviet-Polish issue. The news media in the United States and the United Kingdom generally claim that the disputes between the Soviet Union and Poland may be resolved this time due to Churchill's mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Life and Prices in Beijing <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>In wartime, every place is plagued by livelihood issues, especially because of the backwardness of China's economic organization, which exposes its unreasonable phenomena everywhere in this extraordinary era. On this trip to the ancient capital, the first thing this reporter felt was the soaring cost of living, which is fifteen to twenty times higher than it was two years ago. Riding a rickshaw or pedicab used to cost only two or three mao, but now it costs about five yuan. Having tea in the park used to feel too expensive at one or two yuan, but now even a light snack costs thirty or forty yuan. As for eating in restaurants, it is even more expensive. Assuming there are five or six people, it will cost more than five hundred yuan. So when this reporter occasionally walks into Zhongshan Park or Beihai Park, it always feels deserted and far from what it used to be. In short, the amount of money spent here is roughly the same as in Shanghai last March or April. But we have to note that this is the United Reserve Bank currency, so even if the amount spent is the same, it is a shocking amount when converted to Central Reserve Bank notes. However, in general, the cost of living here is still cheaper than in Shanghai at present, except that rice has already sold for twenty yuan per jin (now it has fallen back to sixteen to eighteen yuan), which is more expensive than in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Coal Shortage and Match Shortage <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Beijing has also been plagued by a coal shortage, with each ton exceeding one thousand yuan in United Reserve Bank currency, and it is impossible to buy without knowing someone. So at present, the housewives of the ancient capital are mostly panicked about this issue. Although the municipal authorities are now trying to solve the transportation problem, it is still a major problem here before it is resolved, because the severe winter is approaching soon. If there is a shortage of coal, it will be much worse here than in Shanghai, and it will inevitably cause great misfortune. In addition to the coal shortage, there is also a sense of panic here due to the severe shortage of matches. It is said that rationing has been delayed for a long time, and each box of ordinary safety matches on the market costs five yuan (and it is still not easy to buy). At the same time, although there are no restrictions on electric lights at night here, a system of staggered blackouts is also adopted, so every place in Beijing always has an hour of power outage every day. During the blackout time, ordinary residents have no choice but to resort to kerosene lamps, so the streets are full of vendors selling oil lamps, and the price of oil has also risen accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Food is Not Very Expensive <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Now I will briefly record the recent market prices of various goods in Beijing as follows: In terms of food, except for the best rice selling for eighteen yuan per jin, other items such as foreign indica rice are sixteen yuan per jin, millet is five yuan and sixty jiao per jin, corn is four yuan per jin, millet flour is four yuan and sixty jiao per jin, red wheat is five yuan and eighty jiao per jin, wheat flour is seven yuan and forty jiao per jin, and Futian flour is seven yuan per jin. In general, the prices of the above-mentioned foods are not very expensive, and may even be a little cheaper compared to some time ago. It is said that rice once soared to twenty-four yuan per jin, and wheat flour also reached about ten yuan per jin. There are two reasons for the low food prices: Firstly, North China had a good wheat harvest this year, and the cooperatives and food corporations have achieved good results in purchasing wheat. Secondly, the municipal authorities have recently been very prompt in rationing food to citizens, and it is said that there will be no more delays in the future, so the prices of various foods have fallen. The food rationing system here now uses the Food Corporation as the main institution. However, the purchase of various major materials is handled by the North China Cooperative (the details of the North China Cooperative were explained in a previous dispatch). A year ago, we heard rumors that the people of North China were only rationed mixed flour, but since the North China authorities improved the rationing policy this year, this phenomenon has completely disappeared. The so-called Food Corporation is a special legal entity responsible for handling the rationing of civilian needs in the three special municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, as well as important industries, and the special rationing of various agencies directly under the North China Political Affairs Commission. The company's capital is provisionally set at 100 million yuan, with the North China Political Affairs Commission and private groups each contributing half. Its main tasks can be divided into four points: Firstly, receiving major foods (note that this is only receiving and not buying, because the purchasing work is done by the cooperative, which is different from the so-called Rice and Grain Control Association in Central China) and storing them; secondly, handling the rationing of major foods; and fourthly, using funds, etc. In addition, local food corporations are also established in various provinces of North China, modeled after the central food corporation, with a capital of 10 million yuan, to handle the transportation of goods purchased from distribution centers and the designated rationing of goods.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Procedures for Food Rationing for Citizens <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The procedures for ordinary citizens in Beijing to receive food rations are roughly as follows: Each month, the Food Corporation decides on the type and quantity of food to be rationed each month based on the existing food supply, and prepares a delivery list to be given to the Municipal Economic Bureau and then transferred to the General Association for Rationing of Daily Necessities, which then goes to the warehouses to collect and transport the food to the various retail rationing stores. As for the issuance of ration tickets, the Municipal Economic Bureau first prints them, then hands them over to the Municipal General Association of the New People's Society, which then forwards them to the various lane leaders to be issued to the households of citizens. According to past regulations, each person can be rationed about ten jin of wheat flour and twenty jin of other grains each month. If this can be done on time, the food supply for residents will generally not be a problem. However, due to transportation problems, there are often delays, and the quantity rarely reaches this ideal. However, although there are difficulties with delays or insufficient quantity in food rationing in Beijing, the delays are never ignored. For example, when this reporter arrived in Beijing, it was already the beginning of September, but the food rations for August had not yet been distributed. Soon they were reissued, although in terms of quantity, there were only ten jin of wheat flour. However, in these few days, this reporter also saw in the newspaper the news of rationing fifteen jin of wheat flour, five jin of miscellaneous grains, and one jin of edible salt for September, which shows that even if they have not rationed enough food, they are not far off. It is said that the municipal authorities are still working hard to improve, so that in the future, the quantity will gradually increase to sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Prices of Important Necessities <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to various rumors, the prices of various goods in Beijing have soared, which happened to be when this reporter arrived. So when I first arrived, I went to the various markets to take a look, and there was a trend of rising prices every day. Therefore, on September 16, the municipal authorities and the Economic Bureau jointly issued a proclamation to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. As a result, prices have gradually stabilized in these few days. To prevent the outflow of materials, the Economic Bureau has also announced the procedures for applying for transportation permits. I will now describe the recent prices of important necessities for the reference of people in Central China:</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Economic Security Office Cracks Down on Scoundrels Impersonating Officials to Extort Money <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Director Gojima Hopes Citizens Will Assist in Reporting Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Police Department has established the Economic Security Office to assist in the wartime economic control policy and stabilize the people's livelihood, in order to carry out this great mission. Since its establishment, the office has achieved remarkable results. Recently, however, many rumors slandering the office have suddenly arisen in the city, and it is clear that villains are taking advantage of the Economic Security Office's name to commit various illegal acts. Director Gojima has issued the following statement:</p>
<h3 id="e29">Using the Name to Solicit Money by Fraud <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office was created to promote and implement the policies of various economic control agencies by exerting police force, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. Its mission is quite important. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the office, we were extremely cautious in the selection and assessment of personnel, and we strictly supervised the performance of duties, so as to avoid the occurrence of illegal acts such as soliciting money in case of accidents. Since the office started its work, it has closely monitored and investigated cases of dereliction of duty by its staff. As a result, there have been only three cases, and the contents are extremely minor. This fact shows that the office has made unremitting efforts to prevent the immoral behavior of its staff. However, there are now various rumors in the streets and alleys, saying that the office staff have received large bribes in connection with certain incidents, and that they have extorted large sums of money under the pretext of settling cases privately, which is very surprising. It is found that police officers other than those in this office, or cunning villains from the outside, use tricks to deceive the parties involved and extort money by using the name of this office. The above-mentioned rumors may have arisen from this. In the future, the parties involved should pay absolute attention and not fall into the trap of villains.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Examples of Recent Incidents <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, when this office deals with the criminals reported, in view of the current economic situation, it adopts a moderate approach to administrative sanctions for those who are related to production enterprises, in consideration of the importance of their production enterprises. Who knew that this would become a good basis for outside villains to plot. The following is a description of a recently occurred example: First, when this office was investigating the illegal acts of the person in charge of a certain trade association, it detained four people other than the chairman of the association. As a result, there were rumors outside that the staff of this office had received a bribe of 1.2 million yuan. After investigation, it was found that the family of the defendants had intended to entrust Shi, a police officer from Kunshan Police Station, to dredge the relationship with the staff of this office who handled the case at a cost of 130,000 yuan, but ultimately failed to approach the staff of this office. Their plan failed. This is an example of a third party from the outside plotting. Second, two investigators from a certain office found that a certain cigarette shop had failed to pay special taxes when checking the books, and immediately threatened to report it to the Special Tax Office or the Economic Security Office, imposing a fine of 200,000 yuan, and extorted 100,000 yuan under the pretext of settling the case privately with the Economic Security Office, and obtained 40,000 yuan as a result. This is an example of a public official from another agency committing a crime using the name of this office. Third, this office imposed an administrative penalty on a certain manufacturer for privately selling cotton cloth, in consideration of the fact that the factory was an important producer, with a fine of 50,000 yuan, a surtax of 250,000 yuan, and confiscation of 500,000 yuan of consideration. Later, it was found that during the trial of the case, He, who had a business relationship with the factory, defrauded the factory of 2 million yuan under the pretext of entrusting a cadre of a certain office to contact the Economic Security Office for private settlement. This is a case of public officials and intermediaries other than those in this office being familiar with the details and using the name of this office. The punishment policy of this bureau is severe for evil criminals, but for those whose circumstances can be considered, it is often given a minor administrative punishment to show compassion. I hereby warn all parties involved that they must not be deceived by such villains in the future, so as to avoid harming themselves. In the future, if we hear of the same incidents, we also hope that they will be reported as much as possible. This bureau will impose the same severe penalties on those who offer bribes and criminals who borrow the name of this office in the future, in order to eradicate this kind of evil police "broker." I hope that the general public will assist us.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Director of the Economic Bureau and Others Answer Questions on the Allocation of Materials <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The 23rd Regular Meeting of Reporters Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office convened the 23rd regular meeting of reporters yesterday. Director Xu Tianshen of the Economic Bureau, Director Feng You of the Material Allocation Office, and Director Gojima of the Economic Security Office successively answered various questions raised by the reporters:</p>
<h3 id="e32">Approving the Issue of Soaring Prices <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>中華日報，平報，新聞報 asked: Recently, the prices of various commodities have been soaring. Are all of them approved by the authorities? Director Xu replied: There are complex reasons for the recent soaring prices, and of course not all of them have been approved. Those approved by this bureau must have reasonable standards and a certain range. Therefore, most of them are illegally raised prices and arbitrary price increases. This bureau has contacted the relevant agencies to seek the most effective way to deal with them. I hope the media will assist us.</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Effect of Suppressing Prices is Very Small <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>新聞報 asked: In the past, the economic authorities of this city have made repeated efforts to suppress prices, but the effect has been very small. What is the reason for this? Director Xu replied: In the past, the work of suppressing prices was ineffective because the power of price management and the power of execution could not be unified, and we could only work on superficial solutions. Therefore, although prices were suppressed for a while, they relapsed after a long time, and the rising trend became even more dangerous. This bureau has put forward several fundamental solutions to this problem and suggested them to the central government. Once a solution is found, the price problem can gradually become stable in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Limited Prices of Stores are Not Thoroughly Good <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>中華日報 asked: The limited prices of stores in this city have never been thorough. What is the reason for this? Director Xu replied: The limited prices of goods in stores in this city are always ineffective, because the prices of rice and coal, the most important necessities of life, are rising from time to time, so other goods are also stimulated and fluctuated. Therefore, it is not easy to achieve a thorough effect if we cannot seek effective solutions in fundamental ways.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Entertainment Venues Stockpile Firewood <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>中華日報 asked: The price of firewood in this city is soaring, and the fuel needs of citizens have become unbearable. However, some large consumers, such as entertainment venues, are stockpiling firewood in Shanghai at huge cost to generate electricity. Is the authorities planning to stop such behavior? Director Xu replied: The reason for the soaring price of firewood is the lack of coal, and citizens are buying firewood to replace coal balls, and many manufacturers are also replacing coal with firewood. As for the situation of consumer entertainment venues buying and stockpiling firewood for power generation, this bureau will also adjust the electricity registration method this time to conform to the purpose of saving consumption and increasing production. It is now in the planning stage.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Poor Quality of Rationed Goods <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The quality of all rationed goods in the past has been very poor. There are often phenomena of rice that cannot be eaten and coal that cannot be burned. I hope the authorities will do their best to improve the quality, increase the quantity, and effectively supervise the malfeasance of the rationing merchants. Director Feng replied: It is the responsibility of this office to receive batches of rice from the Rice Control Association and distribute it to all citizens. This office has no way to interfere with the quality of the rice. As for the malfeasance of rice stores and coal ball factories, this office is investigating together with the Economic Security Office. I hope citizens can help report them.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Stores Must Mark Prices <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The price marking system was originally an effective method to prevent hoarding and suppress the black market. However, all stores are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant. May I ask if the authorities have any good policies for rectifying this? Director Xu replied: This bureau has repeatedly and strictly ordered all industry associations to inform their member stores that they must clearly mark the approved prices on goods sold in their stores. However, many stores still outwardly comply but inwardly defy, intending to take advantage of loopholes. This bureau has already sent a letter to the Economic Security Department requesting strict investigation and severe punishment to deter illegal activities. We also hope that public opinion will cooperate and report such activities at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Flour Price Increase Belongs to the Flour and Wheat Association <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Reporter: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times. Could you explain the reason? Director Feng replied: The prices of various allocated goods are not determined by the Goods Allocation Office. This office is only responsible for allocating allocated goods. Therefore, the reason for the increase in the price of allocated flour should be inquired from the Flour and Wheat Control Committee under the Business Control Association.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Issues with Fees for Business Registration <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>*Ping Bao* asked: There is a rumor that the Economic Bureau charges fees for business registration. Is this an opportunity for unscrupulous people to cheat, or is there another reason? Please clarify the facts. Director Xu replied: This bureau does not collect any fees other than the officially stipulated fees for industrial and commercial registration. This has been known to the outside world for a year. There may be unscrupulous individuals who impersonate and swindle. This bureau will definitely investigate and deal with such matters strictly.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Match Allocation Has Not Been Received Yet <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>*Xinwen Bao* asked: The recent allocation of matches was announced in the newspapers, but it has not been implemented yet. What is the reason for this? Director Feng replied: The matches allocated by this office have always been purchased in bulk from the municipal Match Association. Recently, we also agreed with the Match Association to purchase and allocate matches. However, the Business Control Association has newly established the Daily Necessities Control Committee, and the allocation of matches is now supplied by that Control Committee. Because the transfer procedures between the two associations have not been completed, this office has not yet been able to receive the allocated matches from the Daily Necessities Control Committee. We are currently urging them to expedite the process. As soon as we receive the matches, we will begin the allocation.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Hot Water Price Increase Not Approved <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>*Zhonghua Daily* asked: The price of hot water has reached five yuan per scoop, which greatly affects people's livelihoods. Has this been approved by the authorities? Can hot water stores receive an allocation of coal dust? Director Xu replied: This has not been approved by this bureau. The municipal Goods Allocation Office is planning to allocate coal dust. Director Feng replied: The city's coal reserves are insufficient, and coal dust is also extremely scarce. This office has drafted a plan to allocate coal slag to hot water stores and is currently negotiating this. The recent price increase by hot water stores is likely a black market price and has not been approved by this office.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Police Obstruct the Movement of Goods <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>*Ping Bao* asked: Police officers along the way still obstruct the movement of goods and openly collect fees, especially at various bridges and the Yanping Road intersection in the Fourth District. Please rectify this immediately. Director Wu Dao replied: Various newspapers have repeatedly raised this issue. The police局 has also ordered each branch局 to strengthen supervision and investigation. It is regrettable that this bad habit has not yet been eradicated. Ordinary police officers in this city have no right to interfere with or question the movement of goods. This responsibility belongs to the Economic Security Department. This department has two methods to improve this problem: one is to strengthen supervision and strict monitoring, and the other is to improve the treatment of police officers. Regarding the treatment of police officers in 1937, the lowest salary was twenty-two yuan. Before November 1941, the lowest was one hundred and ninety-two yuan. Before September of this year, it was two thousand two hundred and fifty-one yuan, an increase of about one hundred times. However, the price of rice in 1937 was only fourteen yuan, and now it has exceeded ten thousand yuan, reaching seven hundred and forty-three times. The low income of police officers makes them prone to illegal activities. The current authorities are trying to improve the treatment of police officers, and improvement can be expected in the future. However, citizens should also bear half of the responsibility because they still retain the old habit of bribing when encountering difficulties. We hope that the press will explain in the newspapers that ordinary police officers have no right to interfere with the movement of goods along the way and urge them not to bribe and to cooperate with the police局 to improve this bad habit.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Postal Delays in the City, Post Office Investigating Strictly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Post Office Announces Delivery Times</p>
<p>Recently, the delivery of mail in this city has been delayed for several days before reaching the hands of the recipients, which greatly affects the principle of rapid communication. Complaints from all parties have been heard from time to time. To understand the facts and promote improvements by the postal authorities, a Central News Agency reporter visited the municipal postal administration authorities. The person in charge of the局 stated:</p>
<p>Regarding the delivery of mail, this局 has always adhered to the principle of rapid delivery. This is the main purpose of postal service. Recently, incidents of delayed delivery of mail in this city have been discovered. This局 is currently conducting a strict investigation and hopes that all sectors will promptly send the envelopes of these delayed letters to this局 for investigation, and provide as much advice as possible to assist this局 in promoting postal work. However, it has been found that due to various reasons, the number and timing of mail deliveries have been reduced. It is hoped that the public will understand this. One reason is to reduce costs and personnel. The original three deliveries per day have been reduced to two per day since September 11th. The transportation of mail between the administration局 and branch局 has also been changed to manual labor due to the suspension of automobile services. Second, the current delivery times are 9:00 AM for the first delivery and 2:30 PM for the second delivery (Sundays and holidays have only one delivery at 9:00 AM). Third, for ordinary letters mailed in the morning at the main局 to any area of this city, if they can catch up with the packaging time from the administration局 to the various branch局, they can be received in the afternoon of the same day. However, Nanshi and Pudong only have one delivery at 9:00 AM each day, so they must be delivered the next day. Fourth, letters mailed in the afternoon, after sorting and packaging, cannot catch up with the 2:30 PM delivery schedule and must be delivered the next day. Fifth, letters mailed at branch局 or open-air mailboxes to be delivered to other branch局 must be sealed and sent to the administration局 for sorting before being forwarded to the relevant branch局. Therefore, if they cannot catch up with the packaging and dispatch time, they must be delivered the next day. Sixth, therefore, local mail, unless delayed due to special circumstances, will not be delayed. If the reports of delays of three to five days are true, it must be an occasional misdirection by the sorting personnel. The public should retain these empty envelopes and send them to this局 for investigation. (The envelope can be marked [Official Postal Business] without the need to affix postage stamps). Seventh, due to power restrictions, the night shift at this局 will be temporarily cancelled starting from the 16th of this month. The public is requested to mail letters as early as possible to facilitate timely processing.</p>

It is noteworthy that the proceeds from the sale of items at this charity exhibition will be used to help students, benefit the poor, and provide relief to those who have dropped out of school, which is commendable. Furthermore, promoting art, arousing the interest of Chinese people in studying photography, and raising the artistic value of photography are particularly meaningful.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Symposium on Child Welfare and Education <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing that various charitable causes in Shanghai have faced difficulties in recent years due to the impact of prices, leading to reduced efficiency in providing relief, this newspaper held a symposium on child welfare and education at the Industrial and Commercial Association on September 28th at 4:00 PM to review and improve the situation. More than 40 representatives from various agencies and organizations attended, including Xu Shaoshan, Zhu Lide, Tong Lifan, Lu Deshen, Yu Ye, Hu Dimiin, Li Tianyu, Ye Shouhai, Deng Zhen, Guan Meirong, Wang Zhijin, Ying Yongyu, Lin Daoliang, Bao Yuequan, Shi Shizhen, Zhong Zhigang, Wang Qi, Yuan Peilian, Zhu Hongyun, Tun Jiachuan, Ding Bingnan, Li Ruihua, Wang Hefeng, and Ou Mie'e. The symposium was chaired by Mr. Huang Jingwan, Director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The key points of the discussion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium on child welfare and education. We are honored that you have all attended. Especially since today is the 2,459th anniversary of Confucius' birth. Confucius devoted his life to the spirit of [universal love] and worked hard for the cause of [respecting the elderly as we respect our own, and caring for the young as we care for our own]. Therefore, even after changes in the political and economic environment, he remains a teacher for all generations. The meaning of our newspaper holding this meeting today is particularly profound. Today's guests include more than 20 units from various agencies and organizations. Regarding the current plan to improve child welfare and education, with your farsightedness, you will surely have many grand insights. We are fortunate to hear your high opinions.</p>
<p>I. The Direction, Teaching Materials, and Management of Education for Destitute Children</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Child education is the foundation of all education, and its importance is self-evident. However, children in ordinary families can receive the love and care of their parents and live happy lives, growing up and being educated. There are also many orphaned and helpless children who, due to unfortunate circumstances, cannot enjoy the rights they deserve, especially in Shanghai today, where high prices make child welfare work not only difficult to develop but also difficult to maintain. At this difficult time, our newspaper deeply feels the need to revitalize child welfare work and has proposed four major goals: 1. To cultivate outstanding citizens for the next generation; 2. To strengthen the current child welfare institutions; 3. To realize the spirit of hard work in wartime; 4. To promote inherent character education as a reference for the child welfare movement. Now, please ask Comrade Ding to report on the conclusions of the summer camp organized by the Children's Protection Section this summer.</p>
<p>Ding Bingnan: Many comrades from the summer camp have attended today's meeting. Now that the chairman has asked me to report, please forgive me. At the end of the conference, five proposals were put forward: 1. A request to establish a hospital for destitute children; 2. A request to increase the quantity and variety of special allocations; 3. The participants felt that this meeting had a great bearing on children's welfare, and it was hoped that it could be held annually in the future; 4. Regarding the issue of outstanding destitute children continuing their education, it was hoped that technical schools could be established to meet the needs of destitute children; 5. For destitute children who have left the orphanage as apprentices, due to habit, firstly, they are not suitable for the factory environment, and secondly, they cannot continue to be influenced, so it is hoped that apprentice dormitories can be established. The above five points are hoped to be realized within one year, and it is also hoped that all sectors of society and the media will work together.</p>
<p>Li Ruihua: If there is no difference between the education of destitute children and ordinary education, it is unreasonable both in theory and in practice. It is actually wrong for general child welfare institutions to provide ordinary education to poor children and orphans. We believe that they should at least be made aware of how difficult their environment is, and the expectations of society and the country for them are especially keen compared to ordinary wealthy children. Their responsibilities are so arduous! Regarding teaching materials, general readers are not suitable. For example, the luxurious furnishings or complex families in books and pictures, as well as various titles, social interactions, and exchanges, are not of interest to them. On the contrary, they need the expression of hard-working life and the united life of love, which are not easily found in ordinary teaching materials. Therefore, the summer camp also proposed the compilation of teaching materials, but it could not be realized due to the difficulty of paper and printing. As for management, child welfare education should have a family-like organization, with a spirit of love as the center. Teachers should regard destitute children as their own children, and at the same time, make destitute children regard teachers as their parents. Only in such a harmonious and loving atmosphere can knowledge or skills training be effective. For training methods, I advocate the use of both hands and brain, so that a child welfare institution can be a school for part of the time and a factory for part of the time. In short, it is family-like, school-like, and factory-like. If all three can be achieved, the true purpose can be achieved.</p>
<p>Ding Bingnan: Recently, an experienced and enthusiastic educator criticized the achievements of most educational institutions as unsatisfactory. The main reason is that they pay too much attention to the surface and neglect the fundamentals of education for destitute children. Many destitute children often perform better than ordinary children in their studies, but due to the lack of vocational training, they cannot stand on their own in society once they leave the orphanage. Therefore, education for destitute children should pay attention to a skill, and should have practical skills that meet the needs of society, because the way out for destitute children after graduation is that outstanding children should continue their studies, and most of them should be apprentices. To enable them to adapt to the environment, special attention should be paid during training.</p>
<p>Lin Daoliang: In my opinion, destitute children and ordinary children are not much different in essence or endowment. General child welfare educators place too much emphasis on the distinction between [destitute children] and [ordinary children], which in fact stimulates their pure hearts, which is unreasonable. Their environment is flawed, and their life background is different, but the responsibility of educators is to make up for this flaw, rather than making this flaw prominent. The background of [destitute children] is not as good as that of [ordinary children], but their future is as bright and far-reaching as that of [ordinary children]!</p>
<p>Ying Yongyu: Therefore, destitute children and ordinary children should enjoy equal education and should not be discriminated against. In order to make up for the deficiencies of destitute children, I propose that the appellations in the educational institutions should be changed. It is okay to call teachers [Dad] [Mom] and classmates [brothers and sisters], so that they are harmonious and cheerful, just like a family with parents, brothers, and sisters.

<p>(Continued from page three) Li Ruihua: The term "[suffering child]" does not actually contain any insulting meaning. It is precisely because "[suffering children]" and "[normal children]" are the same in essence and endowment that we should give them educational opportunities. At the same time, precisely because their backgrounds and environments have defects, we should especially train them in the spirit of perseverance and adaptability. For example, the lifestyle or teaching materials should especially emphasize this point so that they do not develop the habits of profligate children. Li Tianyu: In the education of suffering children, there should be special management methods and teaching materials. Without good management and teaching materials, suffering children who leave the institution are prone to doing improper things. If so, not only will the purpose of education not be achieved, but also the hopes and efforts of society will be wasted. Therefore, in addition to knowledge and skills, attention should be paid to character. Deng Zhen: The characteristics of the education of suffering children are particularly prominent above the elementary school stage. Like ordinary children, most become apprentices after graduating from elementary school. In addition, the suffering children who are admitted, due to their age, such as suffering children aged fifteen or sixteen, if they receive six more years of ordinary elementary school education, the result will not be very good. Therefore, their strengths should be used to give them special vocational training so that they have the skills to make a living. Gong Bingnan: In short, these suffering children—or what could be called group children—should be given special training. This training should pay attention to two points: First, the relationship between teachers and children should be strengthened to develop a harmonious and warm family atmosphere. Second, technical training should be given according to age, intelligence, physical strength, and interests so that they can adapt to the environment. Ying Yongyu: I think that at the same time, we should also cultivate character education and instill common social knowledge. Production and Labor Training for Suffering Children Huang Jingwan: What is most related to the future of suffering children is the skill training given to them while they are in the institution. Therefore, production and labor training can be said to be the center of child welfare and education. Many groups in this city have done a very good job in this area, but there are also many groups that find it difficult to develop due to economic and equipment limitations. Now, I would like to ask the staff of each institution to report more so that it can be used as a reference. Wang Hefeng: The education of suffering children can be divided into three stages: First, the basic education stage, including elementary school education. Second, the apprenticeship or vocational education stage, for those who are above elementary school or who are not suitable for elementary school education due to their age, should be taught general knowledge of handicrafts or machinery. Third, the self-reliance stage, even though the suffering children have left the institution and are employed in factories, they should still be given considerable guidance so that they will not drift with the tide and sink into depravity in a bad environment. Among them, the most important production training, in the early stage, although it cannot be directly produced, but light work such as sorting out their own living goods should be learned. In the apprenticeship stage, in addition to teaching working methods and techniques, special attention should be paid to the saving of materials, so that they can be welcomed by society. After graduation, some of them can stay in the institution to work. The above is my understanding of labor training and a brief overview of the methods used by our institution (Tushanwan Orphanage). Ou Mi'e: Our school (Principal of Bosco Orphanage) focuses on vocational training for suffering children above elementary school, and adopts a work-study system, so that they can have a skill on the one hand, and achieve the effect of combining knowledge and action on the other hand. Therefore, they study in the morning, teaching junior high school courses, and work in the afternoon, such as carpentry, bamboo work, carving, embroidery, sewing, bookbinding, etc. Those who are above junior high school and have better grades and higher hopes will continue their studies, while others will be introduced to factories and stores for employment, or taught advanced crafts. For skill training, we strive to suit their personality, such as teaching those with patience to carve, and those with meticulousness to mechanical work. At the beginning of entering society, special attention is paid to their moral knowledge so that they do not go astray. Xu Shaoshan: Our school (Shanghai Christian Children's Education Institute) also takes the religionization of life, the scientification of thought, and the disciplinarization of action as its main tenets, and engages in technical training in a work-study mode, combining education with work. Vacant land is used as a small farm to grow vegetables and raise chickens and rabbits. Other work, such as knitting socks and sewing, is also given considerable training. The Issue of Raising Funds and Unified Institutions Huang Jingwan: At present, child welfare undertakings face many difficulties, the most important of which is the lack of funds. Therefore, if we want to solve the difficulties, the first thing to do is to raise funds, and how to awaken social sympathy is the current issue. Secondly, due to the lack of organization in the undertaking itself, the lack of a unified institution, shortcomings are inevitable. Therefore, we should strengthen unity and seek success with the strength of the group. Therefore, unifying child welfare institutions is the second current issue. Xu Shaoshan: The situation of financial difficulties varies from institution to institution due to talent backgrounds. Therefore, the fundraising methods also vary. The most important thing is the performance of the results, so that those who sympathize will not be discouraged. At the same time, the lack of a unified organization is also one of the reasons for the difficulty in raising funds. Therefore, we need a liaison or advisory organization, not just a supervisory one. Through this organization, comprehensive plans can be made in terms of funding and talent. Furthermore, the current most serious rationing problem can also be solved. In the past, the United Relief Organization made many contributions under the leadership of the Children's Protection Section. I hope that it can be strengthened, be realistic, not be idealistic, and benefit suffering children. Ding Bingnan: All undertakings must have concrete plans and sound organizations. Most of the child welfare institutions in Shanghai are acting on their own, so there are bound to be defects in the development of their work. However, the unification of organizations must be based on planning. We do not need large and useless organizations that are only idealistic. At the same time, such a complex undertaking cannot be solved by one or two meetings today. Before it is realized, you may wish to ask your newspaper to initiate an organizing committee and solicit opinions from all parties so that efficiency can be improved. Guan Meirong: The strength of each individual group is very small. If the Shen Bao can promote it, it will definitely achieve good results. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper is willing to take a stand in public opinion and do its best to promote it. If there can be an organization in the future, I would be very willing to join it as a member. Chen Yisheng: The reason why child welfare undertakings cannot progress at present is that there is a lack of contact between all sectors of society. The government has not yet been able to realize the ideal level of welfare undertakings. There is no connection between enthusiastic people in society and working cadres, so that those with economic power do not have working talents, and those with talents do not have power. Therefore, on the one hand, I hope that your newspaper will promote it, and on the other hand, the original organizations should strengthen their institutions so that child welfare undertakings will not only become the undertakings of one institution and one group, but also become the undertakings of the entire society. The Issues of Suffering Children's Hygiene and Street Children's Relief Li Ruihua: The first priority for the hygiene of suffering children is nutrition, and nutrition is mainly based on rice. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will increase special rationing, not only in quantity and variety, but also in quality. Secondly, the establishment of a children's hospital is urgently needed. Ding Bingnan: It may be very difficult to build a new children's hospital in terms of funding and materials. However, as far as I know, the original intention of the Shanghai Children's Hospital was to specialize in saving suffering children. In addition to hoping that the hospital will continue to serve suffering children, I also hope that your newspaper will do its best to advocate that all hospitals should set up wards for suffering children and accept them at a low cost. On the one hand, I hope to promote the adoption system. Wealthy families without children are welcome to adopt suffering children.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Sacrificing Spirit of the Nuns in the Nursing Home is Admirable <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Generous Donations from All Sectors of Society Target: 5,000,000 Yuan Period: October 10 to November 10 Receiving Location: Social Services Department of this Newspaper Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday The Shanghai Nursing Home, with its otherworldly spirit of benevolence and love, relieves widowers and widows. Those in charge are all nuns who, after completing their studies, vow to remain chaste and serve the elderly for life. In the past, they were not allowed to have land or property to generate profits. The annual operating expenses were entirely dependent on the nuns' fundraising. They did not care about the cold or heat, nor did they avoid wind or rain. They have been doing this for decades. This kind of great sacrificing spirit is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. At this time of high rice prices and expensive firewood, everything is soaring in price, making it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, we have to appeal to society for generous donations. We hope that benevolent gentlemen will generously donate as much as possible. In this way, the elderly will not be on the verge of desperation for their food and clothing needs, and the grace will be endless.</p>
