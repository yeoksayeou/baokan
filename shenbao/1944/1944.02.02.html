<h3 id="c1">代論　共同克服上海危機　陳彬龢 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海工商聯誼會，昨天舉行第四屆會員大會，並歡迎新理事長船津辰一郎就任，席間彬龢曾致簡詞，茲摘鋒於次：</p>
<p>上海工商聯誼會，是由中日工商界人士共同組織的。回憶一年前發起組議時，曾遭遇相當困難。第一，當時在上海的重慶特務人員，多方阻止工商界領袖參加。直到現在，這種情形仍或有之。第二，當時日恩方面，陸海外當局固然一致促成，而當時與亞院却有些微誤會，經過說明後才算瞭解。雖然，僅以聯絡交誼爲目的的工商團體，而從發起到成立，也不無相當的波拆。</p>
<p>我們再檢討一年來該會的工作，不過舉行了若干次歡迎會和歡迎會，以及幾次的定期聯誼會，而對於中日工商界人士促進四人間的友誼，還沒有切實收到。更談不到事業上的合作。僅具聯誼之名，尙無聯誼之實。這是中日工商界，尤其是工商聯誼會會員諸君應加反省的。</p>
<p>目前上海的現狀是怎樣？第一，民生疾苦，這是很危險的問題。第二，工商業是增產還是減產？是發展還是萎縮？復以重慶留滬特務人員種種挑撥間，及共產黨的陰謀破壞，所以，由人情願以一萬萬元資本經營娛樂塲所，而不願經營生產事業。始就上海近郊，以至向和平區的內地觀察，不也是迫切需要改善民生與調整生產事業呢？</p>
<p>當然，這種現象的形成，並不是全部工商界的責任，可是，大家熟視無賭，則覆巢之下，必無完卵。我們觀察上海中日工商界情形，不必諱言的，中國方面，只顧私人事業發達，也就是個人發財慾望的發展，絕未顧到整個社會情形，工商界的前途，以至中日經濟的提攜。所以，這種只顧私人發財的事業，其基礎決非建立於能持久。同時，也不必諱言的，日本工商界方面，雖然有一共同目標——大東亞的共存共榮，可是，實際上似乎也只顧一方面團體的堅固，只顧一方面經濟的發展，而與中國工商界提携合作，還沒有切實做到。這種情形如果繼續下去，那未，對於上海祇有加深危機，這是中日工商界人士又應共同反省的。</p>
<p>克服上海危機，應從改善民生問題着手，所以，我們主張中國工商事業，只圖私人發展，而不顧及大局及民生問題者，應加限制，同時我們認為如果上海的中日工商界不能進一步切實合作，就談不到中日經濟的提攜。不但中日雙方當局合作與中日民間尤其是工商界合作，尤須中日官民四方面的共同合作，才能克服上海的危機。昨天本市一八兩區合併以後，我們在短評中主張，一方面從速建立民意機關，滿通民意，改善民生；一方面應與盟邦僑民領袖，舉行如懇談性質之定期集會，不斷接觸聽取意見，使無隔閡，這就是中日官民四方面共同合作的途徑，願急起圖之！</p>
<h3 id="c2">南京地區舊敵產　昨移交我國接管　蘇杭等地敵產將繼續移交 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>森南京一日中央社電　日本政府為協助中國經濟之復興並增强國府戰力起見，曾將代管之新舊敵產陸續移交我國，對我國之復興協力至為重大，　茲悉日本政府又定於昨一日起至三男底止將渝方關係傷敵產中尙未移交之土地建築物等共三千餘件，（日軍使用中之房地產不在內）。　分數次移交我政府，第一次移管儀式則於昨一日下午二時假本京香舖營中日文化協會舉行。此次移管之敵產包括南京·安慶·蕪湖·句容·蚌埠·合肥·懷遠·貴池地區之縣政府暨其他公共團體所有土地建築物渝系銀行公司，渝方要人所有土地建築物等，計南京江寗句容地區五二三件，其中主要者有中山陵園等。下關江浦大合等地區二三件，重要者有幕府山砲台等。蚌埠懷遠地區四十一件，重要者有中山公園等。合肥懷遠地區五十件，重要者有合肥縣政府等。蕪湖和縣當的淳地區一九〇件，安慶東流湖口銅陵貴池等地區一二八件，重要者有高等省立職業中學等，合計九五五件。此次南京地區舊敵產移交後，蘇州杭州等地區舊敵產亦將繼之先後移交，故預料我國府接收後，對復興中國經濟，當有莫大之貢獻，而能增强戰力，以完遂協力大東亞戰爭之目的，茲將此次移管儀式誌後：</p>
<p>雙方出席代表</p>
<p>一日下午一時許。我國民政府代表外交部長褚民誼，內政部長梅思平，南京市長周學昌，外交部長張公使，徐司長，程科長，內政部洪秘書。市府陸秘書長，張局長等，暨盟邦日本總軍代表稻垣大佐，大使館坂田參事官，南京連絡部長，南京憲兵隊警務課長，城內憲兵隊長，城外憲兵隊長，南京總領事，民團長渡葡中佐，石黑書記官，神谷調查官，宇賀囑託，伊藤囑託等，均相先後蒞臨，魚貫而入中日文化協會建國堂東京應，應內懸有中日國旗，空氣極爲融治，充分表現合作同盟之精神，二時正移管儀式開始，首由日純軍代表稻垣大佐致詞（另銀），詞畢，雙方出席人員稻垣大佐禇外長等，即於移管目錄上簽字調印，褚外長復起立致詞，代表國府表示感謝。繼來賓大使館坂田參事官，內政部長梅思平，南京市長周學昌，南京連絡部長等相繼致詞，均極誠擊，尤以我方來賓梅內長周市長等，聲曾今日移管後，當與各地政府聯絡，務使移管之業產，能够充分利用，以增進國民福社，强化國府經濟力，而利大東亞戰爭，使不致有負盟邦移管之　意。最後雙方出席代表人員復乾杯祝賀，以示慶祝。至三時許，此第一次移管儀式始行完畢。茲誌日續軍代表稻垣大佐之致詞於後：</p>
<p>稻垣大佐致詞</p>
<p>此次日方當局將向來於憲兵隊管理下之南京蚌埠淮南女慶等地區之普通敵產九五五件，移交費國方面關係機關接管，誠堪快慰。年來敵產於處置及管理上，蒙各方協力援助，余於此謹致深厚謝意。日木基於善鄰友好及互尊平等之根本精神，並為促進中國之眞正獨立起見，於政治經濟文化等，均亦以全面協力，此次移管敵產，對强化國府之政治力及經濟力，當能更進一步之發展，在此戰時體制下，房屋問題，與偭人生活上有密切關係，至於今後如何運營，對於逢行國策上影響甚大，故希望僑居中國方面之日人，能充份理解中國當局，以期達到共存共榮敦陸友好之旨趣。</p>
<p>禇外長談話</p>
<p>南京一日中央社電　盟邦日本政府，已於昨一日下午第一次將蘇浙皖三省不在業主之土地建築物九五五件，移交我國管理，當由我外交部長等接受，接管儀式舉行後，褚外長並發表談話如次：二十六年中日事變爆發，戰禍蔓延及全國，當戰事緊急時期，凡日方認為有敵性嫌疑之各種工塲，以及官民所有土地建築物，一槪由日方保存。</p>
<p>自從三十二年一月九日國民政府對英美宣戰以後，盟邦日本便把在華的敵產，先後分別移交我國民政府接管，這已十足表現中日二國，確巳進入同生共死階段，互相携手。以英美為東亞共同敵人，不到把英美擊滅不止。</p>
<p>今天盟邦日本實行把蘇浙皖三省不在業主的產業，即土地建築物移交吾國民政府，事前幾經商洽，並由吾政府頒佈管理規則，從這一點看來，便可以知道日本也正希望他們以東亞民族的身分，來參加大東亞戰爭，共同擊滅英美侵略勢力，以求解放我大東亞全民族。移交蘇浙　皖三省不　在業主的產業，是什麽　一回事呢？就是現在國民政府管轄區域範圍以內的許多不動產，或者是屬於重慶要人所有的私人財產，或者是普通人民所有的，財產而這些人因事變而流徙到別地方去了，這些產業，就變為無人管理，因此日方就代為保管、現在中日兩國既是共同對英美宣戰，便祇有英美是敵人，敵人遺留在我國的財產，尙且交還吾國，何况是吾國人自已的呢，所以不分這些財產是不是一般人民的，還晨重慶要人即抗戰份子所有的，一概移交國民政府，祇等他們回來，便述歷年所收租金，一併還給他們，對於他們的產權，是不是一臺沒有損失呢。在重慶方面的人們，聽了這個消息·應該發生一種什麼感想呢？你們向來認日本是敵八，現在日本是不是認你們當敵人呢？事實勝於雄辯，你們該醒悟了罷，就是國民政府接管這些財產，也祇因為你們遠難，替你們代為保管，你們當然也能明白了。</p>
<p>我們究竟是同是東並人同文同種，應該敵愾同仇，一致團結起來，擊滅東亞公共敵人英美纔對啊</p>

<p>南京一日中央社電　盟邦日本為尊重國府權益於昨日一日下午二時在中日文化協會移管第一批淪舊敵產，日本大使館對此特於一日下午三時發表談話如下：中日事變發生以來，日本軍對淪方所屬權益之各種工廠或其他認為有敵性之官有公有民有士地建鞏物等，曾一律付諸軍管理，並依其用途，加以保存利用·民國二十九年三月國民政府還都南京後，我方即講求移管方針，决定逐次解除敵產處置，並分別移交中國當局及原屬主權人，所有軍管理工塲之各種企業工廠，業已於去年七月全部移交原屬主權人，同時所有敵產事宜有公有民有徒弟建築物，除去現時日軍使用中之一部外，所餘三千九百餘萬，一併移交國府管理，其中現為中國人及第三國人使用者均無條件移管。另有現為日本人使用者，為適應現狀，不使發生急激變化起見，以所定條件為移管方針，於中日雙方關係當局下，妥爲準備，迄今雙方所有之移交及接收等各項手續，均已準備妥竣，準自南京地區起，開始逐漸付諸實施，預計於一二月內，蘇浙皖三省可全部移管完畢，故首大南京地區所在二百五十五件之移管式，特於一日於中日關係官員列席下舉行。此等多數財產移管式，寶為中日兩國極可慶幸者，並望今後中日關係機關，於接收是項移管財產後，對安定民生，與完遂大東亞戰爭下，予以適當之慮置。同時更望現在使用斯項財產着，能善體移管宗旨，努力中日提携。又南京日本憲兵隊為前受國府敵產管理委員會委託負責保管南京蚌埠蕪湖安慶淮南等地區，所有敵產事宜，現以是項主權，業已移交中國當局，對此特發出注意事項如下：根據此次移交敵產原來承受敵產管理委員會及普通敵產處理委員會委託保管之南京·蚌埠·蕪湖。安慶淮南地區之普通敵產家屋，其管理權一律移交中國當局，其移管條件，業經日本大使館發表，關於斯種手續，希望各關係者注意事項如左：　以往經日本普通敵產處理委員頒發貸出或使用許可蹬者，（甲）南京市內除下關外，速向南京市中山東路，憲兵城北隊，（乙）下關地區，速向下關商埠街憲兵城外隊，（丙）其他蚌埠·蕪湖·安慶·淮南等地，各速向所在憲兵隊交出，（由憲兵隊收回）再由各憲兵分隊發行貸出或使用許可引換蹬，持往南京特別市政府，（包括下關地區）或其他地區所在地之縣政府，呈騐甲請重領中國政府頒發之貸出或使用許可證。　租金自二月份起，由中國當局依照所定規則，由南京市政府或各縣縣政府指示繳收之，　其他詳細情形可向黃近各地區憲兵隊詢問之。</p>

<p>里斯本一日中央社電　英美兩國對西班牙之壓迫頓形增大，美政府竟首先禁止向西班牙輸出石油，近數日中英駐西大使霍爾曾與西元首弗朗哥晤談，美駐西大使亦曾與西外長喬達那會談，而西班牙駐英大使阿爾巴氏更急返瑪德里，環繞西班牙之各國外交界正極呈緊迫。刻英美兩國政府以西班牙有藍師團在東綫，領港內有義船停泊，領土內有德人活躍，以及西德兩國間有經濟協定，因此正頻頻對西班牙政府施外交上之壓迫。此次英大使晤見弗朗哥元首時，曾特別設明英美兩國一心對付西班牙中立政策之意，恫嚇謂：茍不急速改善態度，英美兩國政府决改變其曩日對西班牙之政策。同時德駐西大使摩多凱氏則於二十九日訪晤西外長，傳達德政府意旨，謂反軸心各國禁止向西班牙輸出物資，德國願代之提供必需物資。</p>

<p>— 方竹虎</p>
<p>回顧人類的文明史時，我以為這大東亞諸民族會議，早就應該舉行了——洛勒爾像今日我們這樣，亞洲各國民會於一堂，在過去是作夢也想不到的。不可能者現在終於實現了——巴莫</p>
<p>對於大東亞會議的感動，是巴莫。洛勒爾及其他列席會議的諸代表所畢生不忘的。眞的，道種會議早就應該舉行了，現在必須反省一下，認為是「作夢也想不到的」，而就棄置一旁，在這裏表現着前此而洲的可憐相，以及近乎卑躬屈膝的東方的命運觀。亞洲的先覺者幾次為了亞洲的解放而起來戰爭。鴉片戰爭是爲了義憤而戰。辛亥以來的幾次中國革命，在結果上，是爲了要從中國驅逐英美毒素的掙扎，更生。阿姆烈察以來幾次的印度的蹶起，蒲尼法旭以來許多菲島志士的義舉，都是對英美壓制之血的抗議。然而迄今日止，尚未能充分達到其目的者，無非因爲不透切地貫澈「亞洲一體」的信念，不自覺倂爲「一體」的亞洲的力量，是怎樣强靭的綠故。</p>
<p>可是現在，以為不可能者變成可能了。並洲各獨立國的代表，會於一堂，共同宜言大東亞的理想。六國代表同樣醒覺了大東亞的精神，歸於一個理想，大東亞建設的偉業，可說一半已經達到了。</p>
<p>歷史上的空前意義</p>
<p>大東亞共同宣言句句是歷史的煌煌巨文。我們不能不首先知道，那在歷史上空前的意義，不是一條一條的原則，而是為其根本的東方道義精神。什麼是東方的道義精神？就是要建設使「各國各得其所」的共存共榮的秩序　即是不用武力兼併，或不用武力支配的，大東亞家的精神。「使萬邦各得其所，使兆民悉安其堵一，這是日本最近爲了不堪默視不知伊於胡底的騷亂世局，及叵險莫測的人類禍患，乃以國運爲賭，欲勘定中索宣述的趣旨、其根據在於「八纮為宇」的肇國大理想，</p>
<p>大東亞共同宣言，實是各國共同確認日本根據這肇國理想，對亞洲的未來所取的原則的態度，為大東亞建設的根本要義。而且大柬亞各國的代表會合一堂，在極友好的空氣中，意見一致，愼重宣言，所以那是日本的理想，又為大東亞的理想；是日本的建設大東亞方策，同時，又不能不為大東亞共同的建設大東亞的指程標。大東亞會議之得以極迅速地達到此結論者，除决定大東亞命運的戰爭這背景以外，我們也可以看到，各代表的內心，在未舉行會議之先，先已具備東方道義精神的根柢了。</p>
<p>廢棄帝國主義，而採取共榮地域主義，在理念上必須有一個指導國家；茲大東亞共同宣言業已愼重宣佈。而宣言中流露的共同理想，實是較優於任何指導力。</p>
<p>這使萬邦各得其所的思想，基於道義面共存共榮的思想，祇存在於亞洲，絕對不存於英美。他們是覇道，不是王道。嘴裘雖然說正義人道，但除用民族來制被的民族以外，絕對不能想像什麼是共有共榮之道。迄祇要一看他們所說的大西洋憲章，立刻就可以明白。大西洋憲章雖說也散布正義人這的氣息，保障戰後無恐怖，不缺乏的生活，但我們試借問，印度的民族如何？他們所關心者祇是英美民族。他們與凡爾賽和約中拒絕撒廢人種的差別，在他們的限裘，自始就沒有東亞諸民族的自由繁榮·大西洋憲章照例父提倡縮減軍備，但他們提倡軍縮的動機與公式，顯然不出華府會議的範圍以外，他們祇想靠此來維持今後十年的世界覇權吧！他們的野心，是要想把世界的警察權握在他們的掌中。他們的霸道主義，因為終究沒有想到世界永久和平的緣故，所以常在戰爭的陰影面前氣餒。</p>
<p>亞洲本身的醒覺</p>
<p>羅斯福的競爭者溫德爾·威爾基，前年乘飛機巡視反軸心地城後，悲呌着：「英美的覇權現在正在磨煉中。亞洲早巳不聽我們的花言巧語了。他們現在醒覺了內在於他們本身中的力量。他們開始知道推未動來世界的關鍵，在自己的手掌中。」除了力量以外，不知其他的英美的覇道主義，結果，不覺現實地見到覇道主義的破產。</p>
<p>前面已經說過，大東亞共同宣言乃「以建設大東亞期欲貢獻於世界和平。一這是根據宣戰詔書「抑確保東亞之安定，以貢獻世界和平，爲皇祖考皇考所作述之遠猷，而為朕所致力不怠者。」可見大柬亞戰爭的目的，在於確保東亞的安定，以貢獻於世界的和平，這巳無待辭費·因此，其第五個綱領明示「大東亞各國敦睦與萬邦之交誼，撤廢人種差別，普遍交流文化，進而開放資源，以貢獻於世界之進步。」但在實現萬邦協和的世界之前，我們不能不先建設大柬亞。而要建設大東亞，先須從英美的桎梏中把大東亞完全解决出來，保全其自存自衛。</p>
<p>建設大東亞之道無他，唯在於大束亞各國各得其所，而以東方道義精神貫徹之。要使各國各得其所，如共同宣言的綱領中所說，須互相尊重自主獨立。互相尊重傳統，擴張各個民族的創造性。在經濟方面，在互惠下密切提攪，以增進互相的經濟發展與大東亞的繁榮。缺其一就不能說得所，這樣相倚相助，從事大東亞的培育，方才能够建設根據東方道義的共存共榮新秩序·蓋欲冀求世界和平，除使萬邦各得其所以外，斷無別的這路。國際聯盟作為二十世紀的唐·吉訶德，而走到他悽慘的末日，那不單是因爲對象過廣的綠故。那是因為在其實踐上是英美的覇道主義，徒為英美等大國計，一點也沒有涉及到使萬邦各得其所的東方通義。對於揭威爾基如啞子做夢般所感到的，從功利的視角出發，又將如何說法呢？如果英美在這裏略為覺得一點，那不但是他們的幸福。正是這亞洲的文運復興，從東方光被天下。</p>
<p>但行百里者，以九十里為半，大柬亞戰爭正酣，離彼岸尙甚遼遠。不完遂大東亞戰爭，不能脫却英美的桎梏，大東亞宣言自然也等於一紙具文。不僅萬邦共榮的世界不會產生。唯力是信，唯稱覇是求的英美，恐將永久使柬亞隸屬於其下吧！那麼，完遂大東亞戰爭之道如何。這說穿了也是極平常的，祇要大東亞的各國各民族，互相信任大東亞的未來，信任大東亞的使命，信任對英美戰的必勝，而勿與敵以可乘之隙。</p>
<p>雪萊在其「英國膨脹史論」中，費了差不多一半的篇幅，辯護英帝國的征服印度說：「印度沒有國民的性格。在各種地方可以看出方在發芽。因此，使英國可能征服印度。如其印度有與義大利（統一時的）一樣的國民精神，英國幾毫無抵抗，祇有立即敗退。」他在印度沒有國民性裘面，求得征略印度的正當理由。</p>
<p>大束亞的不敗陣勢</p>
<p>這件事，在六十年後的今日，尙有大東亞十億人民，睜着敬愛的目光，鼓勵江特拉·鮑斯氏的自由印度軍，注視其進軍印度。對大東並的結集，也可以說正有同樣的情形。那就是說，大東亞的各國人民，在明暸了征討英美的亞洲性格的時候，大東並不敗的陣勢，已經鞏固地建立起來了。戰爭的前途，想還孕育着許多紆回曲折。可是，祇要大東亞十億人民不失迷大東亞共同宣言的指程標，則大東並戰爭必勝，大東亞建設必成。（翔：譯自一月十一日西部朝日新聞）。</p>

<p>中央社訊　日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於一日會見記者團時，就最近敵方頻頻宣傳之俘虜虐待問題，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>大事宣傳</p>
<p>最近敵方每乘機會，宣傳我方虐待俘虜問題，然此全非事實，僅爲敵方之謀略宣傳，事極明顯。敵方何以須出以此項謀略宜傳，探究其所以，第一可以想見者，乃敵方國內對於其自國非法攻擊日方紅十字船，亦一致加以非難，爲掩飾自己之不法起見，乃出以此項謀略宜傳。第二乃敵之作戰目的，殊欠明瞭，致敵國人民士氣，極爲沮喪，爲昂揚國民敵愾起見，乃出以此項宣傳。第三實爲敵方隱蔽將來馬紹爾島方面大損害之準備工作。至日方對於俘虜之措置，究如何寬大及如何出以武士道精神，此可由就助里斯本丸英人俘虜一例，即可知其一斑。</p>
<p>歪曲事實</p>
<p>以下即爲其真相，英艾登氏於廿八日在下院首稱：余今有一重大消息，報告於議員各位。其後即將一年三個月以前，在東海所發生之俘虜船里斯本丸事件，大加煊染。查英方宣傳機關前會對外廣播，謂里斯木丸滿載香港方面英兵俘虜，向某地進發，其人員約在一千八百名左右云，此條事實，就當時里斯本丸之收容能力而言，收容此數人員，實所當然，然敵方故意歪曲宣傳，謂「該船搭載一千八百名俘虜，全船擁塞不堪，至船內狀况之惡劣，無可形容，多數人員均患營餐不足，及受病魔侵蝕，船內並無任何醫療設備，至衛生設施，更一無所有」云云，均為其一已之憑空臆測，全非事實。</p>
<p>真實狀況</p>
<p>最近有由駐華艦隊報道部派遣至某砲艦之東京新聞宮野記者，直接自參加里斯本丸救助作業之該艦長探得，當時眞實狀况如次：當時有在墩頭　登陸久經轉戰之一部份日軍將兵，亦乘便同搭里斯本丸返國，其中亦有尚需醫療之士兵在內，故謂毫無醫療設備及衛生設施一節，絕非事實。同船之日本士兵，目覩英人俘虜，每日朝晚手拉風琴，口誦爵士音樂，優遊自在，一致認爲奇跡，異口同聲，均謂無法理解被等之心理狀態。由此可見英人俘虜生活，實極逍遙，並無如其本國所宣傳之有絲毫陰鬱空氣存在也。</p>
<p>救助一斑</p>
<p>其次里斯本丸之受美國潛艇魚當製擊，乃係十月一日上午，當時該砲艦正爲謀補充飲料水，航行至上海港附近，迨接得該輸求救警報後，立即　尾駛往救助，照常理所論，敵英美之戰爭觀念既極可恥，此次其俘虜爲其同夥之魚當所擊沉，原儘可置之不理，然日艦司令鑒於自身之責任，及在日本武士道精神之下，卒斷然頒下救助命令。是日波浪險惡，且該艦預定之哨戒期間業經終滿，故煤斤存量已極缺乏，致航行較緩，到達目的地時，已在該日拂曉，立即排除一切惡劣條件及克服種種困難，在艦長指揮之下，開始從事救助。常時里斯本丸已傾斜至約十五度，除儘力保護全船生命財產外，一面須確保船體，乃擬用　索拖至附近淺灘，砲艦遂駛至與里斯本丸距離極近地位，即用相當粗大鋼索，竭力拖曳，然因風浪過大，鋼索三條竟爲之折斷，其後費盡種種方法，始克逐漸拖至淺灘附近，然此時里斯本丸已無法支持，終至沉沒。記者曾赴該地視察，見小島附近有里斯本丸桅竿二根，露出水面，由此可證明當時努力之一斑。而敵方廣播，謂在二十四小時以後，始行沉沒一說，亦可不攻自破。如果有如此充裕時間，則賴艦長熟練手腕，早已將里斯本丸船體同時獲救。</p>
<p>厚遇俘虜</p>
<p>在里斯本丸沉沒前已有多數人員賴舟艇，砲艇，帆船等救至砲艦，此外集結於上甲板之殘餘人員，亦在該輪沉沒前紛紛躍入海中，遊登附近日方砲艦。此項爲砲艦收容之俘虜，竟有赤身裸體，衣服不齊者，日本水兵見狀即撕裂自有之慰問帶，臨時製成衣褲，與以穿着。又該艦原擬駛往上海，補充食糧及飲料，故富時食糧及飲水，均已不甚充分，日水兵乃節滅消費，平均分配，一面並予以烟草。俘虜等自受厚遇，莫不感極而涕，且因便所不足，特在船舷趕造臨時便所數處。亦有俘虜數名，遊登附近島嶼，當地居民，即將自有之衣服，予以穿着，並給以甘薯飯粥善意保護，該項事實，均傒記者直接由該島住民告知，自屬可靠。該島面積狹小，原來駐有日方警備隊，迨接警報後，始急派警備隊前往該島，協同救助一部份游抵海岸之俘虜，此項獲救之英人俘虜，其後即在日本海軍道義的保護之下，由砲艦安然送至上海云。</p>

<p>— 凝</p>
<p>今日起在中國畫苑舉行</p>
<p>大陸新報社與申社聯合舉辦古今書畫展覽會，今日起至六日止，假靜安寺路中國盡苑揭慕，每日上午十時至下午五時公開展覽，歡迎各界人士前往觀摩，展覽作品，都三百餘件，均爲一時上選。三分之二爲非賣品，祗供瀏覽觀摩，三分之一係寄售品。</p>
<p>展覽特色</p>
<p>展覽特色之一，係近代書畫大家吳昌頭·王一亭兩氏作品專室陳列，悉出吳王兩氏哲嗣東邁季眉兩君移借集藏，洵　灘得。</p>
<p>吳昌殖氏作品，計有墨梅·水飛燕·紅菱靑蓮·丹荔·墨蘆·疊石叢蘭·臨散鬲·隸書·山水等件。王一亭氏作品計有鐵仙·大士像·東方朔·佛後·純陽祖師·山水·漁舟人物·永仙花·漁翁。人物抱琴·仙翁羽老鶴·行盡等件。吳王兩氏爲近代名畫家，稍關心藝事者，皆熟諗之，毋庸介紹矣。</p>
<p>克嬗家法</p>
<p>吳東邁名邁，爲吳昌碩先生之季子，宣統之季，曾佐端陶齊制軍之幕，陶齋富收藏，摩挲展玩，而得益尤多，歷莞榷務，廉介是尚，中經憂患，鬱鬱不得志，而藝事日益進，肆意揮豪，克嫂家法，設色則古資生姿，點墨則韻味渾厚，更擅篆隸，上規散槃岐碣之遺，次亦衡方張遷之亞。自昌老徂謝筆勢無徵，薪盡大傳，系之一派，洵足稱焉。其作品參加者，有牡丹長春菊·胡蘆·菊石·松石·牡丹·紫藤·老少年·菜萊蔔等件。</p>
<p>王季眉，名傳燕，爲王一亭先生之三子，冲襟朗抱，意態瀟洒。承乃父庭訓，暇則侍游山水，故胸懷別繞邱壑，發之豪端，所繪人物花鳥蟲魚，學古有法，其氣象之飛動，點墨之沈雄，恒流所不逮。正如文人行雲流水，出之自然，使非功力深邃，曷克臻此，洵集藝事之能，而傳其家學者也。曩歲游日本，朝野名流，爭相交接，久邇宮親王並以銀杯相錫，亦可以見重一時矣。其作品參加者，有雁陣驚寒山水·紅樹靑山好放船·（山水）墨筆（山水）墨竹·蘭竹等件。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪羊譯</p>
<p>八月五·六兩日，海軍兵學校入學志願者的體格檢查，在二中的講堂實施了。</p>
<p>隆夫從早起就現着蒼白的而孔。潛進母校的校門後，心裹突突地跳着，腳步也停住了。素不相識的本縣內應募的學生們，好像螞蟻羣似的，聚滿了校庭中。又將他那沉重的頭抬起來了。要想通過這樣多的人數，的確不是容易的——</p>
<p>「隆夫……我在找你呢！」眞人跑到身旁來了。熊澤·東山·伊知地……等其他軍人班的海軍志願者，都接着趕到了。</p>
<p>偷看着同志們的體格，　夫愈加悲觀起來。不但眼睛是近視——在體格上，像他那　又細又長的，一個也沒有。</p>
<p>眞人對自己的體格，也沒有自信。在母校春期體格撿查的時候，身長一·五八公尺，體重五三公斤，胸圃八二，榮養甲，形態正，視力左右都是一，二。身長和體重的比較，總感覺着不安。</p>
<p>「我的身軀，也很小呀！」但是眞人却嬉嬉地笑着。因為他自己知道，自己的體位，是逐漸增進着的。今年若是失敗了，還可以等待來年。四年就能入學，　是千人中之一的難事，唯有體格，無論你怎樣斷而行之，鬼神也不會避之的——</p>
<p>不久就到時問了，辦事員們招呼大家注意之後，便喊呌號碼。眞人因為年紀小，所以先進考試塲去了。在注意的時候已經　明白了，連　　也要脫去，赤裸裸地光　。向四　一看，都是筋骨健壯的。</p>
<p>最　眞人吃　的，就是檢查方法的嚴　，　非學校中的體格檢查所能比較。但是他是擔心的身長，體重都順利地通過了。其次是視力檢查，這也費　很長的時間。</p>
<p>（我不會因眼睛而被淘汰嗎？）一時也這樣地的擔憂着，並且億又不得不回想到好友　夫的運命。但是，眞人第一日是安然的通過了。他有出口等着他的朋友們。</p>
<p>不久，隆夫同伊知地淚汪汪相擁抱着出來了。一人的結果是不問可知的。</p>
<p>「隆夫……還有來年！」眞人握緊了拳頭，向隆夫的背上　着，一邊　着，從他的眼睛裏也流下淚來了。</p>
<p>眞人在第二天的檢查，也及格了，但是在十二月裏還有學術考試的大難關，在面前等着，</p>
<p>到了秋天，新學期又開始了。隆夫一邊買來近視自豪器，一邊練習眺望遠處的景致，努力於眼睛的養生，但總沒有到眼科醫院去的意思。</p>
<p>這不得了，有了很大的進步……」倘若有人這樣說的時候，他也或許要發狂的。</p>
<p>本來是很快活的隆夫，近來特別悲觀起來，　　　　所以眞人盡力地開門辦着，有時要作外的笑話。而且那也都極其巧妙，所以隆夫有時也要笑得閉不上嘴。這樣說來，他那喜笑的臉，近來似乎越發加添了吸引力。他好像在　倣着，河田校長賞贊的橋本左內的風　似的。外貌宛然像一個婦女，而內　鐵石心腸的英雄，也許是他所理想的人物。</p>
<p>並且，從那時候起，他對於母校的愛，特別激昂起來了。雖然已經達到明白愛情的年齡，但封建細想特別頑固的地方，是不能去愛花愛月，愛一個少女的。他對於菊池少佐計劃的，帶有金絲的學校制帽的徵軍，發現了愛。他很喜歡背面那氣魄浩大，剛直芷明以處事的校訓的　節。</p>
<p>那年的秋犬，殘暑還未盡消的時候，二中的上級學生，被命為新建築東鄉元帥墓地，搬渾泥土的工作。若在現在，便可以說是勤勞奉仕，各學校的學生都有一定的次序，從事工作的。從發表了元帥的　墓，定於東京多　墓地後，在故鄉的當地，都感到失望的時候，而聽到在這鄉土也設分墓，一時喜無洋溢，靑年學生們，也受到了很大的感動。</p>
<p>「我們不要輸給一中！二中的學生，起士的，担挑框的，確實作了極大的奮鬥。尤其是軍人班的人，為名聲起見，也不得不格外的奴力。只穿着一件　衣的眞人的肩上，被滿盛着土的挑籃壓提通紅的要脫下皮來。用鐵鍬掘土的隆夫，累得氣息奄奄，伸出下　來。</p>
<p>一隆夫！不加油不行！」價人不客氣地喊着。隆夫也緊咬着牙根兒，繼續地工作着。然而，柔弱的他，累得頭暈眼花，看着就要倒下來。</p>
<p>正在這時候，停止工作的號令下來了。從　校裏送來了小豆飯的飯團子。他們好像牛一般地喝着水桶裏的水。馬一般地吃着飯團子。隆夫戰戰兢兢地將氣泡的手掌，伸着給眞人看。</p>
<p>「那　算是二中精神！」不知道什麼時候，來在身旁的向大演先生，這樣地激動着。大演光生是二中軍人志望會的主任，要算是次於菊池少佐的剛強的性格的所有者。但是，二中精神，這外詞並非大　先生創造的。這是用漢詩作的校歌的題目脈脈傳承兵兒慨，刮目待西鄉東鄉——這便是那長時的結句。</p>

<p>最近由於煤柴食米各物物價的上漲，各校均增加學費，各校當局付給教職酬勞既因物價高升予以增加，所以增加學費亦屬正當合理。不過也應顧慮到學生家長的負担，因為他們也正因物價的暴漲，每月進益用來應付生活開支，已弄得焦首爛額。則對於子女學費的支付更為束手。現在我們國家正在努力培養靑年加強國民教育的當兒·是不是家庭和學校應當同舟共濟呢？況且學校支付教職酬勞是月付，而學生家長的收益也是月領，所以希望各校當局不妨准予分期交付，酌加利息，這樣辦法當然比較輕而易舉。因為對於學校及教職既無不便，又非不合人情。同時一面分減學生家長的經濟暫時負担，一面又可減少靑年學生失學的悲痛，豈不是一舉三得！希望本市谷校當（特別是收費較多各校）予以考慮實行，更盼教育當局予以特別贊助，能在最近期內實現，則不只因申請助貸學金而向　諸靑年以及因學費較多未能負担行將失學諸靑年膜拜稱謝，而各生家長亦當銘感於五裏！事關國家靑年敎育國家靑年前途，務望各校當局接受分期交費辦法，以符教育建國之旨，誠為德政矣。（一家長）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Commentary: Jointly Overcoming the Shanghai Crisis - Chen Binhe <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association held its fourth member congress yesterday and welcomed the new Chairman, Tatsujiro Funatsu, to his post. During the meeting, Binhe delivered a brief speech, excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association is jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese business leaders. Recalling the initiation of its organization a year ago, it encountered considerable difficulties. First, at that time, the Chongqing special agents in Shanghai did their best to prevent leaders from the business community from participating. Even now, this situation still exists to some extent. Second, at that time, the Japanese side, while the Army and Navy authorities were unanimously promoting it, there were some minor misunderstandings with the Asia Institute, which were clarified after explanations. Although it is only a business group for the purpose of liaison and friendship, there were considerable twists and turns from initiation to establishment.</p>
<p>If we review the work of the association over the past year, it has only held a few welcome parties and regular friendship meetings, and has not effectively promoted friendship among Chinese and Japanese business leaders. Not to mention business cooperation. It has the name of friendship, but not the reality of friendship. This is something that Chinese and Japanese business leaders, especially the members of the Industrial and Commercial Association, should reflect upon.</p>
<p>What is the current state of Shanghai? First, the people are suffering, which is a very dangerous problem. Second, are industries increasing or decreasing production? Are they developing or shrinking? Coupled with the provocations of Chongqing agents stationed in Shanghai and the sabotage of the Communist Party's conspiracies, people are willing to invest hundreds of millions of yuan in entertainment venues rather than in productive industries. From the suburbs of Shanghai to the interior of the peaceful areas, is it not urgently necessary to improve people's livelihoods and adjust productive industries?</p>
<p>Of course, the formation of this phenomenon is not entirely the responsibility of the business community. However, if everyone turns a blind eye, then when the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken. Observing the situation of the Chinese and Japanese business communities in Shanghai, we must frankly say that the Chinese side only cares about the development of private enterprises, that is, the development of personal wealth desires, and has never considered the overall social situation, the future of the business community, or the economic cooperation between China and Japan. Therefore, the foundation of this kind of business that only cares about personal wealth is definitely not sustainable. At the same time, we must also frankly say that although the Japanese business community has a common goal—the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia—in reality, it seems that they only care about the consolidation of their own groups and the development of their own economies, and have not effectively cooperated with the Chinese business community. If this situation continues, it will only deepen the crisis in Shanghai. This is another issue that Chinese and Japanese business leaders should jointly reflect on.</p>
<p>Overcoming the Shanghai crisis should start with improving the livelihood of the people. Therefore, we advocate that Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises that only seek private development and disregard the overall situation and the livelihood of the people should be restricted. At the same time, we believe that if the Chinese and Japanese business communities in Shanghai cannot further cooperate effectively, then there is no possibility of economic cooperation between China and Japan. Not only should the authorities of both China and Japan cooperate, but also the people of both China and Japan, especially the business community, must cooperate. Only through the joint cooperation of officials and civilians from both countries can the Shanghai crisis be overcome. After the merger of the first and eighth districts of this city yesterday, we proposed in a short commentary that, on the one hand, popular opinion organs should be established as soon as possible to fully communicate public opinion and improve people's livelihoods; on the other hand, regular gatherings of a consultative nature should be held with the leaders of allied expatriates to continuously contact them and listen to their opinions to avoid estrangement. This is the way for the joint cooperation of officials and civilians from both China and Japan. We hope to take action quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Transfer of Former Enemy Property in the Nanjing Area - Handed Over to Our Country for Administration Yesterday - Enemy Property in Suzhou, Hangzhou and Other Places Will Continue to Be Transferred <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Mori Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - In order to assist China's economic recovery and enhance the military power of the National Government, the Japanese government has been handing over the old and new enemy properties under its administration to our country in succession, which is of great significance to China's recovery. It is learned that the Japanese government has also decided to transfer a total of more than 3,000 pieces of land and buildings (excluding real estate used by the Japanese military) among the enemy property related to the Chongqing side that have not yet been transferred from yesterday, the 1st, to the end of March. The transfer to our government will be carried out in several batches. The first transfer ceremony was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing. The enemy property transferred this time includes land and buildings owned by county governments and other public groups in the Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, Jurong, Bengbu, Hefei, Huaiyuan, and Guichi areas, as well as banks and companies affiliated with the Chongqing system, and land and buildings owned by important figures from the Chongqing side, totaling 523 pieces in the Nanjing, Jiangning, and Jurong areas, the main ones being the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, etc.; 23 pieces in the Xiaguan, Jiangpu, and Dahe areas, the important ones being the Mufu Mountain Fort, etc.; 41 pieces in the Bengbu and Huaiyuan areas, the important ones being the Zhongshan Park, etc.; 50 pieces in the Hefei and Huaiyuan areas, the important ones being the Hefei County Government, etc.; 190 pieces in the Wuhu and counties under it, and 128 pieces in the Anqing, Dongliu, Hukou, Tongling, and Guichi areas, the important ones being the Higher Provincial Vocational Middle School, etc., totaling 955 pieces. After the transfer of old enemy property in the Nanjing area this time, the old enemy property in the Suzhou, Hangzhou and other areas will also be transferred one after another. Therefore, it is expected that after the reception by our National Government, it will make a great contribution to the recovery of China's economy and enhance its military power to complete the goal of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. The record of this transfer ceremony is as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives from both sides attending</p>
<p>At around 1:00 p.m. on the 1st, the representatives of our National Government, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Interior Minister Mei Siping, Nanjing Mayor Zhou Xuechang, Foreign Minister Zhang Gongshi, Director Xu, Section Chief Cheng, Secretary Hong of the Ministry of Interior, Secretary-General Lu of the Municipal Government, Director Zhang, etc., and representatives of the Allied Japanese General Army, Colonel Inagaki, Counselor Sakata of the Embassy, Director of the Nanjing Liaison Office, Chief of the Police Affairs Section of the Nanjing Military Police, Commander of the City Military Police, Commander of the Outskirts Military Police, Consul General of Nanjing, Commander of the People's Corps Lieutenant Colonel Wataru, Secretary Ishiguro, Investigator Kamiya, Trustee Uga, Trustee Ito, etc., arrived one after another and entered the Tokyo Hall of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, where the national flags of China and Japan were hung. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious, fully demonstrating the spirit of cooperation and alliance. At 2:00 p.m., the transfer ceremony began. First, Colonel Inagaki, the Japanese military representative, delivered a speech (recorded separately). After the speech, the attendees from both sides, Colonel Inagaki, Foreign Minister Chu, etc., signed and stamped the transfer list. Foreign Minister Chu then stood up and delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the National Government. Following that, guests, Counselor Sakata of the Embassy, Interior Minister Mei Siping, Nanjing Mayor Zhou Xuechang, Director of the Nanjing Liaison Office, etc., delivered speeches in succession, all of which were extremely sincere. In particular, our guests, Interior Minister Mei and Mayor Zhou, stated that after the transfer today, they will contact the governments of various places to ensure that the transferred properties can be fully utilized to improve the welfare of the people and strengthen the economic power of the National Government, and benefit the Greater East Asia War, so as not to fail the intentions of the allied nations in the transfer. Finally, the representatives of both sides toasted each other to celebrate. The first transfer ceremony was completed at about 3:00 p.m. The speech of Colonel Inagaki, the Japanese military representative, is recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech by Colonel Inagaki</p>
<p>It is gratifying that the Japanese authorities are transferring 955 pieces of ordinary enemy property in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Huainan, and Anqing areas, which have been under the management of the military police, to the relevant agencies of the Republic of China. Over the years, we have received assistance from various parties in the disposal and management of enemy property, and I would like to express my deepest gratitude here. Based on the fundamental spirit of good neighborliness, friendship, mutual respect, and equality, and in order to promote the true independence of China, Japan is also providing comprehensive assistance in politics, economy, culture, etc. This transfer of enemy property will further develop the political and economic power of the National Government. Under this wartime system, the housing problem is closely related to the lives of the people. How it will be operated in the future has a great impact on the implementation of national policies. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese residing in China can fully understand the Chinese authorities in order to achieve the purpose of coexistence and co-prosperity and friendly relations.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The Allied Japanese government transferred 955 pieces of land and buildings not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to our country for management for the first time yesterday afternoon. Our Foreign Minister, etc., accepted the transfer, and after the transfer ceremony, Foreign Minister Chu issued the following remarks: When the Sino-Japanese Incident broke out in 1937, the war spread to the whole country. During the emergency period of the war, all kinds of factories and land and buildings owned by officials, civilians, etc., that the Japanese side considered to be of enemy nature were preserved by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, 1943, the Allied Japanese have transferred the enemy property in China to our National Government for management in succession, which fully demonstrates that China and Japan have indeed entered a stage of living and dying together, joining hands. Taking Britain and the United States as the common enemy of East Asia, we will not stop until we have destroyed Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Today, the Allied Japanese have implemented the transfer of the property not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, namely, the land and buildings, to our National Government. After several consultations and the promulgation of management rules by our government, it can be seen that Japan also hopes that they will participate in the Greater East Asia War as East Asian people to jointly destroy the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in order to liberate our entire East Asian people. What is the transfer of property not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui? It is many immovable properties within the scope of the jurisdiction of the current National Government, either private property owned by important figures in Chongqing, or property owned by ordinary people, and these people have migrated to other places due to the incident. These properties have become unmanaged, so the Japanese side has kept them on their behalf. Now that China and Japan have jointly declared war on Britain and the United States, only Britain and the United States are the enemies. The property left by the enemies in our country is still returned to our country, let alone the property of our own people. Therefore, regardless of whether these properties belong to ordinary people or to important figures in Chongqing, that is, anti-Japanese elements, they are all transferred to the National Government. We will wait for them to return and return the rent collected over the years to them together. Their property rights have not been lost at all. People in Chongqing, what kind of feelings should you have when you hear this news? You have always regarded Japan as the enemy. Does Japan regard you as the enemy now? Facts speak louder than words. You should wake up. Even if the National Government takes over these properties, it is only because you are far away and we are keeping them on your behalf. You can certainly understand.</p>
<p>We are all East Asians of the same race and culture. We should unite and fight against the common enemy of East Asia, Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Remarks by the Japanese Embassy on the Return of Old Enemy Property in Chongqing - Precautions Issued by the Japanese Military Police <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - In order to respect the rights and interests of the National Government, the Allied Japanese transferred the first batch of old enemy property in Chongqing at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The Japanese Embassy issued the following remarks on this matter at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese army has uniformly subjected all kinds of factories or other official, public, and private land and buildings belonging to the Chongqing side that were considered to be of enemy nature to military management, and preserved and utilized them according to their uses. After the National Government returned to Nanjing in March 1940, our side immediately studied the transfer policy and decided to gradually lift the disposal of enemy property and transfer it separately to the Chinese authorities and the original owners. All kinds of enterprises and factories in the military-managed factories have been completely transferred to the original owners in July last year. At the same time, all enemy property matters, including public and private land and buildings, except for a part currently used by the Japanese army, the remaining more than 39 million pieces, have been transferred to the National Government for management. Among them, those currently used by Chinese and third-country people are unconditionally transferred. For those currently used by Japanese people, in order to adapt to the current situation and avoid drastic changes, the transfer policy is based on the conditions set forth, and preparations are made properly under the authorities of both China and Japan. To date, all transfer and reception procedures on both sides have been prepared, and it is planned to gradually implement them starting from the Nanjing area. It is expected that the transfer of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui can be completed in one or two months. Therefore, the transfer ceremony of 255 pieces in the first major Nanjing area was held on the 1st with the presence of Sino-Japanese officials. This transfer ceremony of many properties is something that both China and Japan can be very happy about, and it is hoped that the relevant Sino-Japanese agencies will give appropriate consideration to stabilizing people's livelihoods and completing the Greater East Asia War after receiving the transferred properties. At the same time, it is hoped that those who are currently using these properties can understand the purpose of the transfer and strive for Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition, the Nanjing Japanese Military Police, which was previously entrusted by the Enemy Property Management Committee of the National Government to be responsible for the custody of all enemy property matters in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan areas, now issues the following precautions because this right has been transferred to the Chinese authorities: According to this transfer of enemy property, the management rights of the ordinary enemy property houses in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan areas, which were originally entrusted to the Enemy Property Management Committee and the Ordinary Enemy Property Disposal Committee for custody, are uniformly transferred to the Chinese authorities. The transfer conditions have been announced by the Japanese Embassy. Regarding these procedures, it is hoped that the relevant parties will pay attention to the following: (1) Those who have been issued loan or use permits by the Japanese Ordinary Enemy Property Disposal Committee in the past, (a) In Nanjing City, except for Xiaguan, go to the Military Police Chengnan Detachment on Zhongshan East Road, (b) In the Xiaguan area, go to the Military Police Chengwai Detachment on Xiaguan Shangbu Street, (c) In other places such as Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan, go to the local Military Police Station to hand them over (to be collected by the Military Police Station), and then obtain a loan or use permit exchange card issued by each Military Police Sub-detachment and take it to the Nanjing Special Municipal Government (including the Xiaguan area) or the county government in other areas to present it for verification and apply for a new loan or use permit issued by the Chinese government. (2) Starting from February, the rent will be collected by the Chinese authorities in accordance with the regulations set forth, as instructed by the Nanjing Municipal Government or the county governments of each county. (3) For other details, please inquire at the local Military Police Station.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Spain has increased sharply. The U.S. government has even banned the export of oil to Spain. In recent days, British Ambassador to Spain Hoare has met with Spanish Head of State Franco, and U.S. Ambassador to Spain has also met with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana. Moreover, Spanish Ambassador to Britain Alba has urgently returned to Madrid. The diplomatic circles of various countries surrounding Spain are presenting a very tense situation. Currently, the governments of Britain and the United States are frequently exerting diplomatic pressure on the Spanish government due to the presence of the Blue Division in Spain on the Eastern Front, the docking of Italian ships in the port, the activities of Germans in the territory, and the economic agreement between Spain and Germany. During his meeting with Head of State Franco, the British Ambassador specifically stated the intention of Britain and the United States to deal with Spain's neutral policy and threatened that if Spain did not quickly improve its attitude, the governments of Britain and the United States would change their previous policy towards Spain. At the same time, German Ambassador to Spain Mottke visited the Spanish Foreign Minister on the 29th to convey the intention of the German government, saying that since the anti-Axis countries have banned the export of materials to Spain, Germany is willing to provide essential materials in its place.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The Spanish Ambassador to Britain flew here from London yesterday and then took a German plane to Madrid. A Spanish plane was scheduled to take off today and seats have been reserved, but the Duke said that he could not wait.</p>

<p>Rome, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to Haitong News Agency: It has been nine days since the British and American forces landed in Nettuno. The situation in Rome is still very peaceful. The sound of cannons was heard on Saturday. Entertainment venues are still very crowded. The curfew has been extended from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - Combining front-line news; the anti-Axis landing forces in Nettuno have begun to move with Rome as their target. On the other hand, the anti-Axis forces on the Cassino front are also responding to break through Gustav Line, and it seems that they have officially launched an attack on Cassino. The Nettuno landing forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle of advance and retreat with the German army between Carkete northwest of Anzio and the Naples railway. According to the Associated Press, the anti-Axis headquarters announced on the 31st that the anti-Axis forces, regardless of the German army's obstruction, had completely landed the support troops after the Nettuno bridgehead. The anti-Axis forces on the Cassino front aimed to break through the middle of Zielwa Lo and Cassino. As a result of the German army's change of the Rapido River, wooden bridges were erected on the flooded roads to continue the effort to advance. German Supreme Commander Marshal Kesselring personally went to Gustav Line a few days ago and ordered his soldiers to defend the line. On the other hand, the German army launched a counterattack on the Tyrrhenian coast of the lower Garigliano River and recaptured the height east of Cassino. The British Eighth Army on the Adriatic coast has begun military operations in the Castel di Sangro area southwest of Lanciano.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - Washington dispatch: U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief General King forcefully stated the difficulties of the war against Japan in a radio broadcast on the evening of the 30th, as follows. The further the anti-Axis forces advance and the closer they get to the Japanese mainland, the more the war front in the Pacific will be shortened and the more the Japanese army's defense will be strengthened, and the more difficult it will be to break through to operations. People in the United States believe that the war is about to end and hold unfounded optimism. This bad phenomenon will inevitably make the soldiers fighting hard on the front line feel dissatisfied. The Japanese army occupied the vast territory with amazing speed during the war. We must keep in mind that before attacking Tokyo, we must first occupy the Philippines and many other islands. Now that the U.S. troops are fighting at a distance of 2,000 miles from Tokyo, it is inappropriate to hold a baseless optimism.</p>

<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—At a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee of Japan on the 31st, various discussions were held regarding the trends in schools. Ministry of Education officials answered questions from the Diet members. The content of their responses is as follows: (Increasing the number of medical students) Mr. Nagai, Director of the Vocational Education Bureau, responded, stating: Because the number of physicians currently being trained is insufficient to meet the demands of the military authorities, it is planned to increase enrollment of new students by 3,000 at medical universities and medical vocational schools starting next year. (Reorganization of Commercial Schools) Mr. Fujino, Director of the General Affairs Bureau, responded, stating: Most of the local commercial schools are being converted into industrial schools; other schools are being converted into agricultural schools or girls' commercial schools. Currently, there are 450 commercial schools nationwide, and it is planned to convert 270 of them into industrial schools. As for facilities, efforts will be made to utilize existing facilities or to use the equipment of nearby industrial schools. For the subjects, facilities provided by factories will be used, with emphasis placed on subjects related to factories. Regarding the supplementation of teachers, efforts will be made this year to expand the number of teachers, with plans to train temporary teachers and establish a new higher normal school for science and engineering. Furthermore, cooperation in educational work will be requested from industrial testing laboratories and other institutions.</p>
<p>Policy Toward International Students</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—The plenary session of the House of Peers Budget Committee of Japan reconvened at 1:10 PM on the 1st. During the session, Diet member Michiyo Mishima posed the question: "What is the guiding policy regarding international students from the Greater East Asia region and other countries?" Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki responded: International students are promising young people from various regions whose purpose is to be trained as personnel for the construction of Greater East Asia. Recently, a guiding policy for their support was decided upon in a Cabinet meeting, with the hope that international students in Japan will fully recognize and understand the national conditions of Japan during their study period, so that upon returning to their home countries, they can become good leaders and work to promote cooperation between their countries and Japan. At the same time, it is hoped that the people of Japan will have a deep understanding of the international students from various countries.</p>
<p>The Issue of Developing North China's Economy</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—At a meeting of the House of Representatives North China Development Committee on the 31st, Diet member Chozaburo Odaka raised questions regarding the issue of developing the economy of North China. Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki responded, with the following main points: The North China Development Company has no intention of increasing its capital. The funds needed for development will be supplemented by issuing company bonds, so the limit for issuance has been expanded based on the previously revised company law. Furthermore, there is still a considerable amount of unpaid shares in the company. If these are collected in the future, the funds will be sufficient to fully engage in increased production work. The railway projects in North China are all undertaken by the North China Transportation Company, cooperating with the Chinese authorities, and striving to achieve future objectives. Efforts are currently focused on repairing routes and increasing vehicles, etc. Regarding port facilities, construction is currently underway in Dagu, Qingdao, and Lianyungang. Once completed, the capacity of the ports will be increased. To revitalize heavy industry, the need for electricity goes without saying. The materials for which increased production is being strongly pursued this month are limited to alumina, etc., with the production of materials determined based on the electricity situation. Therefore, efforts are currently focused on strengthening thermal power generation and utilizing hydroelectric power generation. The food problem is not only the foundation of an important industry but also directly related to people's livelihoods, so the Chinese government also considers it the top priority of its two major policies. The goal of the North China food policy is self-sufficiency. Therefore, water control and utilization are being implemented in North China, and the undertaking of expanding Taihu Lake has begun in Central China. In addition, various measures are being implemented, such as improving varieties, eliminating pests, and improving techniques. Japan has also established agricultural experiment stations and dispatches technical personnel to actively provide assistance. The current problem is establishing the foundation for effective harvesting and transportation. However, regarding North China's food production increase measures, the habit of relying on external sources among the Chinese has not been completely eliminated, and because it conflicts with the increase in cotton production, it is difficult to achieve self-sufficiency overnight.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—The Supreme Soviet of the USSR decided to share diplomatic responsibilities at its tenth meeting. This seems to have caused great repercussions in the anti-Axis camp, and political circles in London seem to be uneasy and are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. According to a Stockholm dispatch from the Swedish Dagens Nyheter on the 31st, London political circles are observing the Soviet move as follows: The Soviet Union's intention in establishing People's Commissariats of Foreign Affairs in the federal republics is formally to have each republic share diplomatic responsibilities, and it intends to send 16 representatives to the international conferences after the war, just like the British Empire, to strengthen its voice. The Soviet Union adopted the above measures to technically facilitate the annexation of the three Baltic states, Galicia, the eastern half of Poland, and Bessarabia. The Soviet Union is trying to imitate Britain and adopt a federal autonomous system, and there is no doubt that its target is mainly Britain's European diplomatic policy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Expression of the Greater East Asia Declaration by Asahi Shimbun Vice President <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Takehiko Hojo</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of human civilization, I believe that this Greater East Asia Conference of Nations should have been held long ago—Laurel. Like us today, it was unimaginable in the past that various Asian nations would gather together in one place. What was impossible has finally become a reality—Ba Maw.</p>
<p>The emotions experienced at the Greater East Asia Conference were unforgettable for Ba Maw, Laurel, and the other delegates who attended the conference. Indeed, such a conference should have been held long ago. We must now reflect on how we thought it was "unimaginable" and set it aside, because this reveals the pitiful state of Asia up until now and the almost servile Eastern view of destiny. Asian pioneers rose up in war several times for the liberation of Asia. The Opium War was fought out of righteous indignation. The several Chinese revolutions since the Xinhai Revolution were, in effect, struggles and rebirths to drive out British and American toxins from China. The several uprisings in India since Amritsar and the righteous deeds of many Philippine patriots since Bonifacio were all bloody protests against British and American oppression. However, the reason why they have not fully achieved their goals to this day is simply because they did not thoroughly adhere to the belief in "Asia as one" and were not aware of how strong the power of "Asia as one" is.</p>
<p>But now, what was thought to be impossible has become possible. Representatives of the various independent countries of Asia have gathered together to jointly declare the ideals of Greater East Asia. The representatives of the six countries have all awakened to the spirit of Greater East Asia and have converged on a single ideal. It can be said that half of the great undertaking of Greater East Asia construction has already been achieved.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Significance in History</p>
<p>Every sentence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a brilliant historical document. We must first realize that its unprecedented significance in history lies not in each principle, but in the underlying Eastern moral spirit. What is the Eastern moral spirit? It is to build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity that "allows each nation to be in its proper place," that is, the spirit of the Greater East Asia family that does not annex by force or dominate by force. "To enable all nations to be in their proper place and to enable all people to live in peace" is the purpose of Japan's recent declaration of its intent to resolve the chaotic world situation and the unpredictable human disasters, with its national destiny at stake. Its basis lies in the great ideal of the founding of the nation, "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof."</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is, in effect, a joint confirmation by various countries of the principles and attitude that Japan is taking towards the future of Asia based on this founding ideal, and is the fundamental essence of Greater East Asia construction. Moreover, the representatives of the various countries of Greater East Asia came together in a very friendly atmosphere, reached a consensus, and made a careful declaration, so it is Japan's ideal, and it is also Greater East Asia's ideal; it is Japan's policy for constructing Greater East Asia, and at the same time, it must also be a common benchmark for the construction of Greater East Asia. In addition to the background of the war that will determine the fate of Greater East Asia, we can also see that the representatives' hearts were already rooted in the Eastern moral spirit before the conference was held, which is why the Greater East Asia Conference was able to reach this conclusion so quickly.</p>
<p>Abandoning imperialism and adopting regional co-prosperity requires a guiding nation in principle; the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already been carefully proclaimed. The common ideal revealed in the declaration is superior to any guiding force.</p>
<p>This idea of enabling all nations to be in their proper place, based on the moral principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, exists only in Asia and absolutely not in Britain and America. They are about hegemony, not benevolent rule. Although they pay lip service to justice and humanity, they can never imagine the way of co-ownership and co-prosperity, except to use one nation to control another. Just look at their so-called Atlantic Charter, and you can immediately understand. Although the Atlantic Charter also exudes the atmosphere of justice and humanity, guaranteeing a life without terror or lack after the war, we ask, what about the people of India? All they care about is the British and American people. They refused to abolish racial discrimination in the Treaty of Versailles. From the beginning, the freedom and prosperity of the peoples of East Asia were not included in their limits. As usual, the Atlantic Charter advocates disarmament, but the motives and formulas for their disarmament are clearly no different from those of the Washington Conference. They just want to rely on this to maintain their world hegemony for the next ten years! Their ambition is to hold the world's police power in their hands. Their hegemonic thinking is often discouraged in the face of the shadow of war because they ultimately do not think about lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Asia's Own Awakening</p>
<p>Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt's competitor, after touring the anti-Axis cities by plane last year, lamented: "British and American hegemony is now being ground down. Asia has long ceased to listen to our sweet talk. They are now awakening to the power inherent within themselves. They are beginning to know that the key to moving the world in the future is in their own hands." Other than power, British and American hegemonic thinking, which knows nothing else, has, as a result, realistically seen the bankruptcy of hegemonic thinking.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration states that "the construction of Greater East Asia is intended to contribute to world peace." This is based on the declaration of war, "To ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace is the distant vision made by our ancestors and emperors and what We have been striving for tirelessly." It can be seen that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace, which goes without saying. Therefore, its fifth principle clearly states, "The Greater East Asian nations shall cultivate friendship with all nations, abolish racial discrimination, promote cultural exchange, and open up resources to contribute to the progress of the world." But before we can realize a world of harmony among all nations, we must first build Greater East Asia. And to build Greater East Asia, we must first completely liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America and preserve its self-existence and self-defense.</p>
<p>The way to build Greater East Asia lies solely in allowing each nation of Greater East Asia to be in its proper place and in implementing it with the Eastern moral spirit. To allow each nation to be in its proper place, as stated in the principles of the Joint Declaration, one must respect each other's autonomy and independence. Respect each other's traditions and expand the creativity of each nation. In economic terms, they must cooperate closely on a mutually beneficial basis to promote each other's economic development and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. If one is missing, one cannot say that it is in its proper place. Only by relying on each other in this way and engaging in the cultivation of Greater East Asia can we build a new order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on Eastern morals. In order to seek world peace, there is no other way than to enable all nations to be in their proper place. The League of Nations, acting as the Don Quixote of the twentieth century, ended up in its tragic end, not only because the target was too broad. That was because its practice was British and American hegemonic thinking, which only benefited the great powers such as Britain and America and did not involve the Eastern moral principle of enabling all nations to be in their proper place at all. How will we speak from a utilitarian perspective about what Wendell Willkie felt like a deaf man dreaming? If Britain and America feel even a little bit of this here, it will not only be their happiness. It is precisely the revival of Asian civilization, from which the East illuminates the world.</p>
<p>He who travels a hundred miles considers ninety miles as half. The Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, and the other shore is still very far away. If the Greater East Asia War is not completed, the shackles of Britain and America cannot be broken, and the Greater East Asia Declaration will naturally be equivalent to a mere piece of paper. Not only will a world of co-prosperity among all nations not be created, but Britain and America, who believe only in force and seek only hegemony, will probably permanently subordinate East Asia to them! So, how can we complete the Greater East Asia War? To put it bluntly, this is also extremely ordinary. As long as each nation and people of Greater East Asia trust in the future of Greater East Asia, trust in the mission of Greater East Asia, and trust in the inevitable victory in the war against Britain and America, and do not give the enemy a chance to take advantage.</p>
<p>In his "A Defense of the English Nation," Shelley spent almost half of the essay defending the English Empire's conquest of India, saying, "India does not have a national character. It can be seen sprouting in various places. Therefore, it made it possible for England to conquer India. If India had the same national spirit as Italy (at the time of unification), England would have retreated immediately with little resistance." He found the legitimate reason for the conquest of India in the fact that India did not have a national character.</p>
<p>The Invincible Formation of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Sixty years later, the one billion people of Greater East Asia are still looking with admiring eyes, encouraging Subhas Chandra Bose's Free India Army and watching its march into India. The same can be said of the gathering of Greater East Asia. That is to say, when the people of the various countries of Greater East Asia understand the Asian character of conquering Britain and America, the invincible formation of Greater East Asia has already been firmly established. The future of the war is still pregnant with many twists and turns. However, as long as the one billion people of Greater East Asia do not lose sight of the compass of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Greater East Asia War will be victorious and the construction of Greater East Asia will be achieved.

<h3 id="e19">Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing: Increase in Quota Approved; Cotton Control Office Actively Preparing Rationing Procedures <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the issue of carrying out a temporary one-time cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai, the Cotton Industry Control Office of the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, due to the approval by the Executive Yuan of the National Government last year, stipulated that half of the cotton cloth reserve of each retailer should be distributed to the public, and set a price, which was notified by the Control Office to the Cotton Products Industry Association, which relayed the information to the cotton cloth businesses, who were to commence on schedule. The plan was to ration 1.5 zhang of cotton cloth per person. Later, after a meeting of the cotton cloth businesses, it was unanimously agreed that with Shanghai's population estimated at 3.5 million, half of the reserve cloth of all retailers was insufficient for supply. Therefore, a document was submitted to the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, requesting that the Executive Yuan increase the rationing quota to ensure universal supply. According to information obtained from the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, the request from the cotton cloth businesses to increase the temporary rationing quota from the reserve has been formally approved by the Executive Yuan. The Cotton Industry Control Office is currently actively engaged in general preparation procedures, such as preventing congestion and duplicate purchases, so that each resident of Shanghai can purchase 1.5 zhang and not be turned away.</p>
<p>Free Movement of Native Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>The Cotton Products Industry Association previously sent a letter to the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, requesting that all native yarn and cloth exempted from purchase be allowed to move freely within the city, and requested that the letter be forwarded to the relevant authorities for facilitation. The reporter has learned that the Bureau of Commercial Statistics has forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the First and Second Police Bureaus, notifying all subordinate units to immediately release all native yarn and cloth being transported along the way to alleviate merchants' difficulties.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) Mr. Hirota Yoji, Chief of the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, will return to his home country next week to take up an important position in a certain department of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry. Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, Secretary, who will succeed him as Chief of the Information Department, arrived in Shanghai from Kyoto yesterday and has already formally taken office.</p>
<p>Chief Hirota's Farewell Remarks</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy hosted a reception for the Chinese press corps on the eighth floor of the Hualian Hotel on the Bund. More than a dozen people attended, including Chief Hirota, Vice-Consul Fukuma Toru, and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Hirota made the following farewell remarks: During my tenure as Chief of the Information Department in Shanghai, I received special cooperation from the Chinese press, which facilitated the smooth and clear flow of ideas between China and Japan. I would like to express my deep gratitude to everyone. During my time in Shanghai, I witnessed the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now that the war is intensifying, the ties between our two countries are becoming even closer as the war progresses. For example, the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, China's participation in the war, the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have all been realized one after another. The relationship between China and Japan is now so close that it strengthens the war effort of both sides. I believe that the fact that we share the same hardships in this joint war will lay the foundation for the future relationship between China and Japan. I look forward to the victory of the Greater East Asia War, when we can all share the joy together. The current war is a war to change the world. Under this principle, Japan needs to complete the Showa Restoration, while China absolutely needs to complete the Chinese National Revolution. In particular, after the completion of this revolution, China can obtain a completely modern and independent nation, and this revolution should be extended to all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and society. I have been in Shanghai for more than a year and a half. During this period, I deeply felt that this revolution is still being carried out continuously in China, step by step, to achieve the final goal. This effort to complete the revolution is progressing more and more every day. I pay special respect to the leaders of this movement and the insightful people who have the determination to complete the revolution. I am deeply moved by the genuine efforts of your countrymen in building a new China. I will always remember and never forget the kindness and special cooperation that China has shown me. After returning home, I will convey these feelings to the Japanese people and do my best to make the relationship between China and Japan even closer and more cooperative.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Enemy Frequently Spreads Rumors of Mistreating Prisoners of War; Purely Propaganda Tactics; Chief of the Press Section Matsushima Clarifies the Facts <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, met with the press corps on the 1st and made the following statement regarding the recent enemy propaganda about the mistreatment of prisoners of war:</p>
<p>Major Propaganda</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has seized every opportunity to spread rumors that we are mistreating prisoners of war. However, this is completely untrue and is merely a propaganda tactic by the enemy, which is very obvious. As for why the enemy needs to resort to this propaganda tactic, the first reason that comes to mind is that the enemy's own illegal attacks on Japanese Red Cross ships have been unanimously condemned in their own country. To cover up their own illegal acts, they have resorted to this propaganda tactic. Second, the enemy's war aims are very unclear, which has led to extremely low morale among the people of the enemy country. To boost the people's hatred of the enemy, they have resorted to this propaganda. Third, it is actually a preparation by the enemy to conceal the great damage they will suffer in the Marshall Islands. As for how leniently Japan treats prisoners of war and how it treats them with the spirit of Bushido, this can be seen from the example of the British prisoners of war rescued from the Lisbon Maru.</p>
<p>Distorting the Facts</p>
<p>The following is the truth. Mr. Eden of England stated in the Lower House on the 28th: "I have a major piece of news to report to the members." He then exaggerated the Lisbon Maru incident, which occurred in the East China Sea one year and three months ago. The English propaganda machine had previously broadcast to the outside world that the Lisbon Maru was full of British prisoners of war from Hong Kong and was heading to a certain place, with about 1,800 people on board. This fact, in terms of the Lisbon Maru's carrying capacity at the time, made it natural to accommodate this number of people. However, the enemy deliberately distorted the propaganda, saying that "the ship was carrying 1,800 prisoners of war, the entire ship was overcrowded, and the conditions inside the ship were indescribably bad. Most of the people suffered from malnutrition and were invaded by diseases, and there was no medical equipment on board, and even the sanitation facilities were non-existent." These are all conjectures based on their own ideas and are completely untrue.</p>
<p>The Real Situation</p>
<p>Recently, Tokyo Shimbun reporter Miyano, who was dispatched from the Press Section of the Fleet stationed in China to a certain gunboat, learned directly from the captain of the ship that participated in the rescue operation of the Lisbon Maru the true situation at that time: At that time, some Japanese soldiers who had landed at Dun Tou and had been fighting for a long time also took the Lisbon Maru to return to their country. Among them were also soldiers who still needed medical treatment, so it is absolutely untrue to say that there was no medical equipment and sanitation facilities. The Japanese soldiers on the same ship witnessed the British prisoners of war playing the accordion every morning and evening, chanting jazz music, and enjoying themselves freely. They all thought it was a miracle and said in unison that they could not understand the psychological state of those people. From this, it can be seen that the lives of the British prisoners of war were extremely carefree, and there was no trace of the gloomy atmosphere that was propagated in their own country.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Rescue</p>
<p>Secondly, the Lisbon Maru was hit by a torpedo from an American submarine on the morning of October 1st. At that time, the gunboat was sailing near the port of Shanghai in order to replenish drinking water. After receiving the distress signal, it immediately steered its stern to the rescue. According to normal logic, since the enemy, the United States and England, have an extremely shameful concept of war, they could have ignored the fact that their prisoners were sunk by torpedoes from their own allies. However, the captain of the Japanese warship, in view of his own responsibility and under the spirit of Japanese Bushido, resolutely issued the rescue order. The waves were treacherous that day, and the ship's scheduled patrol period had ended, so the coal reserves were extremely low, which made the voyage slower. When it arrived at its destination, it was already dawn that day. It immediately eliminated all unfavorable conditions and overcame various difficulties. Under the command of the captain, it began to carry out the rescue. At that time, the Lisbon Maru had tilted to about 15 degrees. In addition to trying to protect the lives and property of the entire ship, it also had to ensure the hull. It planned to tow it to the nearby shoal with a cable. The gunboat then sailed to a position very close to the Lisbon Maru and used a fairly thick steel cable to try to tow it. However, due to the excessive wind and waves, three of the steel cables were broken. After spending all kinds of methods, it was able to gradually tow it to the vicinity of the shoal. However, at this time, the Lisbon Maru was unable to support itself and finally sank. The reporter went to the scene to inspect and saw two masts of the Lisbon Maru near the small island, exposed above the water, which can prove a glimpse of the efforts at that time. The enemy's broadcast that it sank after 24 hours can also be refuted. If there was such ample time, the captain's skilled hand would have already rescued the hull of the Lisbon Maru at the same time.</p>
<p>Generous Treatment of Prisoners</p>
<p>Before the Lisbon Maru sank, many people had already been rescued by boats, gunboats, and sailboats to the gunboat. In addition, the remaining personnel gathered on the upper deck also jumped into the sea one after another before the ship sank and swam to the nearby Japanese gunboats. Among the prisoners received by the gunboat, there were those who were naked and unclothed. When the Japanese sailors saw this, they tore their own comfort belts and temporarily made clothes and pants for them to wear. In addition, the ship originally planned to sail to Shanghai to replenish food and drink, so the food and drinking water were not very sufficient at the time. The Japanese sailors reduced their consumption and distributed them evenly, and also gave them tobacco. The prisoners were extremely grateful for the generous treatment and shed tears. Also, due to insufficient toilets, several temporary toilets were built on the side of the ship. There were also several prisoners who swam to nearby islands. The local residents gave them their own clothes to wear and kindly protected them by giving them sweet potato rice porridge. These facts were told directly to the reporter by the residents of the island and are reliable. The island is small and originally had a Japanese garrison stationed there. After receiving the alarm, it urgently dispatched the garrison to the island to assist in rescuing some of the prisoners who had swam to the shore. The British prisoners of war who were rescued were later safely sent to Shanghai by the gunboat under the moral protection of the Japanese Navy.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Prelude to the Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings and Calligraphy <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Ning</p>
<p>Held at the Chinese Painting Academy starting today</p>
<p>The Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, jointly organized by the Continental News Agency and the Shen Bao, will be held at the Chinese Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road from today until the 6th. It will be open to the public from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit and learn. The exhibition will feature more than 300 works, all of which are carefully selected from the time. Two-thirds are non-sale items, only for browsing and learning, and one-third are consignment items.</p>
<p>Exhibition Features</p>
<p>One of the features of the exhibition is the special exhibition of the works of Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting, two great masters of modern painting and calligraphy. All of them are borrowed and collected by Wu Dongmai and Wang Jimei, the sons of Wu and Wang, which is truly a rare event in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wu Changshuo's works include ink plum blossoms, water swallows, red water chestnuts and green lotuses, red lychees, ink reeds, stacked stones and orchids, imitations of San Ge, calligraphy, landscapes, etc. Wang Yiting's works include Tie Xian, Da Shi Statue, Dongfang Shuo, Buddha, Chunyang Patriarch, Landscapes, Fishing Boat Figures, Yong Xian Flowers, Fisherman. Figures Holding Qin, Immortal Weng Yu Lao He, Xing Jin, etc. Wu and Wang are famous modern painters, and those who are slightly concerned about art are familiar with them, so there is no need to introduce them.</p>
<p>Able to Carry on the Family Tradition</p>
<p>Wu Dongmai, whose name is Mai, is the youngest son of Mr. Wu Changshuo. In the last season of Xuantong, he served as an assistant to the Tao Zhai military governor. Tao Zhai was rich in collections, and he benefited a lot from rubbing and playing with them. He went through Guan taxation affairs, and his integrity was still valued. He experienced hardships and was frustrated, but his artistic skills improved day by day. He indulged in writing and carrying on the family tradition. His coloring is ancient and full of vitality, and his ink is mellow and profound. He is also good at seal characters and official script, following the legacy of San Pan Qi and Jie, and also similar to Heng Fang and Zhang Qian. Since Chang Lao passed away, the brush strokes have been lacking, and the fire has been passed on, and it is enough to be called a school. His works participating in the exhibition include Peony Changchun Chrysanthemum, Gourd, Chrysanthemum Stone, Pine Stone, Peony, Wisteria, Old Boy, Vegetables and Radishes, etc.</p>
<p>Wang Jimei, whose name is Chuanyan, is the third son of Mr. Wang Yiting. He has a broad mind and a free and easy attitude. He inherited his father's family training and often traveled in mountains and rivers with him in his spare time, so his mind was full of hills and valleys, and he expressed them in his pen. The figures, flowers, birds, insects and fish he painted follow the ancient methods, and their flying atmosphere and the deep and powerful ink are beyond the reach of Heng Liu. Just like literati's flowing clouds and flowing water, they come out naturally. If it were not for deep skill, how could they achieve this? It can be said that he has gathered the skills of art and passed on his family's learning. In the past few years, he traveled to Japan, and celebrities from all walks of life competed to associate with him. Prince Kuni Palace also gave him a silver cup, which can also be seen that he was highly valued at one time. His works participating in the exhibition include Goose Array Jinghan Landscape, Red Trees and Green Mountains are Good for Boating, (Landscape) Ink Brush (Landscape) Ink Bamboo, Orchid Bamboo, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Komuro Takeo has contributed the most to the establishment of this association. Mr. Komuro was the second chairman of this association. Because he was honorably transferred to an important position in the head office of Mitsui Bussan in Tokyo, he resigned on December 27 last year. The Japanese board of directors has publicly elected Mr. Funatsu Chenichiro to succeed him. Mr. Funatsu has been in China for decades and is admired by all circles in China and Japan. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Funatsu, the association's business will be even more developed, which can be foreseen. In addition, the Japanese board of directors has recently nominated and supplemented two new directors, Mr. Okeba Kazuo and Mr. Yamamoto Masao, and has also continued to recruit four new members, Mr. Takashima Kikujiro, Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, Mr. Iwaya Mitsuo, and Mr. Banno Kiyoshi, who are also outstanding figures in the business community of this city, so that they can jointly plan the association's business, which is a great blessing for the future of this association.</p>
<p>Today, this association is holding the 4th General Meeting of Members, warmly welcoming the new Chairman Mr. Funatsu, and also welcoming the new directors and new members to join the association, which is a very rare opportunity.</p>
<p>In addition, the New Year's reunion of the members of this association is also held together with this General Meeting of Members to celebrate. Finally, I wish all members a happy New Year.</p>
<p>Now, let's invite the new Chairman Mr. Funatsu to speak and give us guidance."</p>
<p>Funatsu's Speech</p>
<p>New Chairman Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro then delivered a speech. He said briefly: "I am succeeding Mr. Komuro as the chairman. Although I have been in China for more than 10 years, I have rarely interacted with the business community. I am taking up this important position this time and I am ashamed to be unworthy. I know that the responsibility will be heavy in the future, and I hope that everyone will give me extra cooperation. I am very grateful for the warm welcome today, etc." Next, Kurimoto Inji reported on the association's affairs. Then, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Fudeng, Ueba Zenzo, Chen Bin-Su, Lai Bao, Cheng De, etc. successively delivered speeches to congratulate Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro on his appointment as the new chairman, and also expressed their earnest expectations for the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association and the relations between the Chinese and Japanese business communities in the future. The grand occasion was extremely enthusiastic and the meeting ended happily at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) Yesterday (1st) was the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the China General Assembly of the East Asia League. In addition to the celebration ceremony held by the Nanjing General Assembly, branches and sub-branches in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing, Xuzhou and other places also held celebrations at the same time. The Shanghai Branch and the Nanshi Branch of the association also held a celebration ceremony at the hall of the branch on Yuyuan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (1st). The meeting was presided over by Mr. Liu Yanshan, the acting secretary-general of the branch. The main idea of his opening speech was: We should recognize the East Asia League Movement as a re-promotion of Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and the concrete realization of Pan-Asianism. The East Asia League Movement is an international movement in which people of all countries cooperate with the government to form a new system of East Asia unity. Now the East Asia League Movement has become the most powerful movement for all countries to oppose Anglo-American aggression. On the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the China General Assembly of the East Asia League, in addition to our heartfelt celebrations, we still need to work hard to realize the ideal and reality of the East Asia League Movement. After the celebration meeting, the branch also sent propaganda teams to publicize in various urban areas of Shanghai, and hung slogans and distributed public notices.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Idle Wasteland <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The most crucial task for us in the year of increased production is to broaden the path of increased production. Utilizing waste for manufacturing and cultivating wasteland are both methods to open up this path. Regarding the use of wasteland to supplement production, we initially focused on this in June of last year with the topic "Citizens of Our Capital, a Garden Each," followed by "Jiangwan Wasteland" in November of the same year, strongly advocating for the widespread cultivation of all wasteland in the four suburban areas of Shanghai, turning it into vast farms to supplement Shanghai's food and vegetable supply.</p>
<p>In early December of last year, the Shanghai Special Municipality Idle and Waste Land Survey Team was established. Since its formation, it has conducted a comprehensive survey of all wasteland within the city. The survey was scheduled to be completed by the end of February. The key aspects noted during the survey process, besides the place names, topography, and location, included the soil properties, suitable plants for cultivation, and strategies for promotion. Based on this survey direction, we would like to contribute the following suggestions: if the soil properties are suitable for planting agricultural products such as rice, wheat, cotton, potatoes, grains, vegetables, or even fruits, then it should be developed into farmland. If the soil properties are not suitable for planting, then it should be developed into warehouses, specifically for storing surplus agricultural products obtained from annual increased production, in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, surplus wasteland unsuitable for planting could be utilized to create public sports fields, specifically for the use of farmers in the four suburban areas, thereby helping to cultivate their labor force. This would also be a contribution that idle wasteland could make to us.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Newly Established Companies and Businesses Should Immediately Join Trade Associations, Otherwise Business Operations Will Be Suspended According to Law <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, many new companies and businesses have been established in this city. A portion of them have not joined their respective industry trade associations. This situation violates the principle of commercial autonomy. According to leaders of various trade associations who spoke to reporters yesterday, all types of companies and businesses are required to join their respective associations after formally commencing operations. This was clearly stipulated by the government authorities. Recently, some businesses, unaware of the situation, have been evading membership. Once these businesses are discovered, the trade associations will submit a request to the relevant authorities to order their business suspension in accordance with the law. It is also understood that all firms and shops without a trade association organization should individually join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members, so that relevant authorities can provide guidance and ensure sound business development.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Major Investors Buy Low, Chinese Shares Show Slight Rebound <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese shares stopped falling and started to rise. This was largely due to the heavy losses of the past two days, which allowed the market to stabilize somewhat. Some major investors seized the opportunity to buy low. The recovery of a certain city was prematurely announced, the financial panic has subsided, and people's confidence is returning. However, the tight credit situation continues to worsen. Therefore, the stock market has generally been prosperous amidst uncertainty. Wing On Department Store rose by ten yuan, and the afternoon off-exchange price continued to rise to 223 yuan for buying. Sincere rose by nine yuan. National goods were the most stable, and Guanghua and other department stores also made progress. Textile stocks and silk companies rebounded by forty yuan, but the price of silk remained firm and did not follow. Tongyi Yarn Factory suddenly rose by 32.5 yuan, Wing On Yarn Factory rose by 9.5 yuan, and Yuanyuan, Tongfeng, Jingfu Shirt, and others also increased significantly. Cultural stocks unanimously rose considerably. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French was flat, and Sinya and others turned slightly firm. Among real estate stocks, Wing Tai, Taisan, and others each rose by more than half a yuan. Other stocks, such as China National Investment, Sinya Construction, and Zhongxing Zhenye, all rebounded. San Lok and San Sin Industrial declined. Chengda Enterprise rose by 1.5 yuan. Today's closing price list is as follows:</p>

<p>Recently, rumors have circulated in the market that the Gold Exchange, which has been closed for a long time, will be revived in the near future, attracting attention from all parties and causing speculators to stir up trouble, which has had a considerable impact on the market.

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>On August 5th and 6th, physical examinations for naval academy applicants were conducted in the Second Middle School's auditorium.</p>
<p>From early morning, Lung Fu looked pale and gaunt. After slipping through the gates of his alma mater, his heart thumped wildly, and his footsteps faltered. Unfamiliar applicants from within the county gathered in the schoolyard like a swarm of ants. Again, he lifted his heavy head. Passing through so many people would certainly not be easy –</p>
<p>"Lung Fu... I've been looking for you!" Jen Ren ran over. Xiongze, Dongshan, Izuchi... and other naval applicants from the military class arrived one after another.</p>
<p>Secretly observing the physiques of his comrades, Lung Fu became increasingly pessimistic. Not only were his eyes nearsighted – there was no one with a physique as thin and lanky as his.</p>
<p>Jen Ren also lacked confidence in his own physique. During the school's spring physical examination, he measured 1.58 meters tall, weighed 53 kilograms, had a chest circumference of 82 centimeters, had excellent nutrition, a normal physique, and 20/20 vision in both eyes. The comparison between his height and weight always made him feel uneasy.</p>
<p>"My body is also small!" But Jen Ren smiled cheerfully. Because he knew that his physical condition was gradually improving. If he failed this year, he could wait until next year. Enrolling in four years was a difficult task, one in a thousand. Only one's physique, no matter how determined you are, cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Soon, the time came. The clerks called everyone to attention and then called out the numbers. Because Jen Ren was young, he entered the examination hall first. As they paid attention, it became clear that they had to take off everything, and stand naked. Looking around, everyone was muscular and strong.</p>
<p>What surprised Jen Ren the most was the rigor of the examination methods, which was incomparable to the school's physical examination. But his worries about his height and weight were unfounded as he passed smoothly. Next came the vision test, which also took a long time.</p>
<p>(Will I be eliminated because of my eyes?) He worried for a moment, and then could not help but think back to his good friend Lung Fu's fate. But Jen Ren passed the first day safely. He exited to meet his friends.</p>
<p>Soon, Lung Fu and Izuchi came out, tearfully embracing each other. One person's result was obvious.</p>
<p>"Lung Fu... there's always next year!" Jen Ren clenched his fist and patted Lung Fu on the back, tears streaming down his face as he did so.</p>
<p>Jen Ren also passed the second day of examinations, but a major hurdle, the academic examination in December, awaited him.</p>
<p>In the autumn, the new semester began again. Lung Fu bought a nearsightedness corrector and practiced looking at distant scenery, working hard to nourish his eyes, but he never intended to go to the eye hospital.</p>
<p>"This is terrible, there has been a great improvement..." If someone said that, he might go crazy.</p>
<p>Lung Fu, who was originally very cheerful, had become particularly pessimistic lately. Therefore, Jen Ren tried his best to cheer him up, sometimes making jokes. And those were all extremely clever, so Lung Fu would sometimes laugh so hard that he couldn't close his mouth. That said, his smiling face seemed to have become even more attractive recently. It seemed that he was emulating the style of Hashimoto Sanai, whom Principal Kawada praised, whose appearance was like a woman, but whose heart was as hard as iron. That might be the character he idealizes.</p>
<p>Moreover, from that time on, his love for his alma mater became particularly intense. Although he had reached the age where he understood love, in places where feudal ideas were particularly stubborn, he could not love flowers and the moon, or love a girl. He loved the recruitment of school caps with gold thread, planned by Major Kikuchi. He liked the grand and upright school motto on the back, which was based on justice.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year, when the lingering summer heat had not yet dissipated, the upper-class students of the Second Middle School were ordered to transport mud for the construction of Admiral Togo's new tomb. If it were now, it could be said to be diligent service. Students from various schools had a certain order to engage in work. After the Admiral's tomb was announced to be located in Tokyo's Tama Cemetery, when people in their hometown felt disappointed, they heard that a branch tomb would also be set up in this hometown, and joy overflowed for a while, and the young students were also greatly moved.</p>
<p>"We can't lose to the First Middle School! The students of the Second Middle School, those pushing wheelbarrows and carrying baskets, really put in a lot of effort. Especially the people in the military class, for the sake of their reputation, had to work extra hard. Jen Ren, wearing only a vest, had his shoulders pressed so red by the soil-filled baskets that the skin was about to peel off. Lung Fu, who was digging soil with a shovel, was so tired that he was panting and sticking out his tongue.</p>
<p>"Hey Lung Fu! You have to cheer up!" Jen Ren shouted unceremoniously. Lung Fu gritted his teeth and continued to work. However, the weak Lung Fu was so dizzy that he was about to fall.</p>
<p>At this moment, the order to stop working came down. Rice balls with red beans were sent from the school. They drank water from buckets like oxen. They ate rice balls like horses. Lung Fu tremblingly showed Jen Ren his blistered palms.</p>
<p>"That is the spirit of the Second Middle School!" Mr. Mukai Daen, who had come to his side at some point, was agitated. Daen Mitsuo was the director of the Second Middle School Military Hope Association and could be regarded as the owner of a strong personality second only to Major Kikuchi. However, the words "spirit of the Second Middle School" were not created by Mr. Mukai. This was a topic of a school song written in Chinese poetry, which has been handed down from generation to generation. Raise soldiers, and treat Saigo and Togo with new eyes -- this is the conclusion of that long song.</p>

<h3 id="e38">School Introduction <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Zhixing Night School) Zhixing Night School, a private institution, focuses entirely on providing basic national knowledge during students' spare evenings. In addition to the elementary school department (which is the same as a regular elementary school), a commercial class elective has been specially added to meet the needs of young people in vocational and business fields. It is designed for students with junior high school or higher education levels. The curriculum emphasizes practical skills and provides more opportunities for practice to realize the ideal of "learning for use." Each class has a quota of 50 students. The elementary school department also has a quota of 50 students per grade. Half-fee and free places are available for children from poor families. Applications are currently being accepted. The new semester is scheduled to begin on February 10th. The school is located at 366 Boer Road, District 8. (Students on Work-Study)</p>
<p>(Science High School) The Chinese Science High School, located at 263 Jupless Road, is the former location of the Textile Factory Staff Training Institute of Chengfu Trust Company. Therefore, all equipment and supplies are very complete. It has a lawn and a vast exercise field. Classes are held for seven hours a day. The second enrollment has already begun. (Lu Xichen)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Suggestion to Pay Tuition Fees in Installments <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the rising prices of coal, firewood, rice, and other goods, schools have increased tuition fees. It is legitimate and reasonable for school authorities to increase the remuneration of teachers and staff due to the high prices, so increasing tuition fees is also proper and reasonable. However, consideration should also be given to the burden on students' parents, as they are already struggling to make ends meet due to the soaring prices, and are even more strapped for cash when it comes to paying their children's tuition fees. Now that our country is working hard to cultivate young people and strengthen national education, shouldn't families and schools be in the same boat? Moreover, schools pay teachers and staff monthly, and students' parents also receive income monthly, so it is hoped that school authorities may allow payment in installments, with a reasonable interest rate. This method is of course easier and more convenient. Because it is neither inconvenient for schools and teachers nor unreasonable. At the same time, it reduces the temporary financial burden on students' parents and can reduce the pain of young students dropping out of school, isn't this a triple win! It is hoped that all schools in the city (especially those with higher fees) will consider implementing this, and it is hoped that the education authorities will provide special support to realize this in the near future. Then not only will the young people who apply for student loans and the young people who are about to drop out of school because they cannot afford the high tuition fees be grateful, but the parents of all students will also be deeply grateful! It concerns the nation's youth education and the nation's future. It is hoped that the school authorities will accept the installment payment method to fulfill the purpose of building the country through education, which would truly be a benevolent policy.
