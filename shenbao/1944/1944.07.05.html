<h3>社評　前進</h3>
<p>在戰塲上，在決戰時，不能躊躇，不能徘徊，只有前進。退後一步，便是死路，往前一步，即是生路。國家在戰爭時期，前方將士要前進，後方民衆更要前進，前後一致，國家然後可獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>大家先要下一個前進的決心，時時刻刻要力求進取。無論在思想上，在行動上，都要有遠大的眼光，切不可故步自封，自鳴得意，因此而阻止發展進步的途抓。眼前的安樂不是永久的安樂，現在不過是一個過渡的階段，過波得好，過渡得壞，全在本人自已的努力。切不可存若依賴的心理，外界的力量至多只能幫助人們前進，對於本身不前進酌，人們是無法援助的。決戰時期來臨了，世界民族競走巳經將到終點，千鈞一髮的時候，最要當心，程一懈怠，全功盡棄，現在努力一分，抵得過以往的十分，現在前進一步，祇得過以往的十步。諺語說，天助自助者，先要自助，然後能得天助。不向前奮鬥的人們，除了後退而到滅亡以外，沒有第二條路的。</p>
<p>大家更要有埋頭苦幹，百折不撓的勇氣，時時刻刻，不畏艱難，勇往直前。世界上沒有僥倖成功的事，凡是僥倖成功的，必定不是永久的成功，鐘是歷史上的通例。大東亞戰爭是經過英美百年壓迫之下，民挨自然反抗的趨勢，所以大東亞戰爭的成功是勢所必然，理所必至。可是，因為百年歷史環境關係，敵人一定耍用最大的力量來維持他們榨取的利益。我們反抗的力量愈大，敵人壓迫的力量亦愈增加，現在到了最後五分鐘，敵人更要用最大的力量，孤注一擲，這是決定性的，一剎那間，就可決定我們解放和自由的前途。所以壓迫的力量愈大，我們的鬭志愈堅，環境愈困難，我們的精神愈昂揚。我們要沉著應付，我們要穩扎穩打。我們現在耐些勞，吃些苦，世界上的事情還有比道個更值得的嗎？</p>
<p>大家更要有同舟共濟，同甘共苦的精神，時時刻刻，大公無私，共同奮鬭。現在已經不是求私利的時期了，現在已經不是求個人享受的時期了。大家先耍以整個國家民族為前提，切不可囿於個人的利害，大家先尊以解除國家民族的痛苦為前提，切不可只圖個人的享樂。一切都是整個的，個人不過是整個的一份子，整個的生存是個人生存的最高保障。同時，靴關是要用大家共同的力量去征服的，國家民族的複興是全國國民努力的成績，更不是一二個人所能任當的。因此，大家有一個共同的「公」的目標，大家依著這個目標共同的奮鬭，是目前渡過難關的唯一途徑，更是全國國民在戰爭時期應負的資任。</p>
<p>更正：七月一日社評，「商統會調整以後」一文中未段，「至於目前的重要課題」句下第　項，排植稍誤，更正如下：「對於棉布收買工作，應速完竣。臨時配給工作，間有複雜混亂，應加補救。對此，棉業管理處結束委員會，應卽調整加强，負起資任」</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電一據日軍某軍艦報道班員三日訊：馬：馬亞納大海戰，實係日本興亡之海上大決戰，最初</p>
<h3>先發制人</h3>
<p>的攻擊，是日本海軍航空部隊作在六月十九日早晨發動的，首先樹立了擊破敵航空母艦數艘的功績，後來更於薄暮實施攻擊夜襲，潛水艇也出動活躍，於是戰果愈形增大。六月某日，日本聯合艦隊的一部，認為時機已到，遂準備踴躍出動，這次出襲的敵軍實力，據聞有釗戰艦十幾艘，正式航空母艦十艘左右，特製航空母艦十幾艘，再加上巡洋艦，驅逐艦，潛水艇等等，共約一百多艘，總算是傾注了太平洋方而海軍的大部份力量，來大舉進攻。從十一日到十八日這幾天，驅使着自誇在一千架以上的艦載機，頻頻轟炸馬利亞納羣島的日本空軍藻地，另一方面海上的艦艇也節節進逼，進至馬利亞納羣島附近，作艦砲射擊，十五日竟更在塞班島登陸，這種顧前不顧後的進攻，挑起日軍</p>
<h3>聯合艦隊</h3>
<p>殲敵的雄心，日本聯合艦隊的一部，遂在某地集合，積極備戰。某日午後，日聯合聯隊出動艦隊的司令官，更對部下作意義深長的訓示謂：「我部隊將趨滅敵之壯盞，請各舉全力以戰」。出動艦隊的全部人員，接到這種訓示，非常興舊，上至艦長，下至士兵，十八日堂堂向敵艦隊活躍的一舉海面進攻，十九日也就是決戰之日，天色尙　黑未明，紫敵飛機聯合出動，一會兒紅日徐昇，索敵飛機發現了敵軍機動部隊，首先報吿敵軍機動部隊現在馬利亞納準島西方海上，約分三羣，第一羣正式航空母艦四艘，戰艦二艘，其他艦艇十幾艘，第二眾正式航空母艦三艘，戰艦五艘，其他艦艇十幾艘，第三羣正式航空母艦一艘，特製航空母艦而搜艘，戰艦一艘，其他艦艇約十艘。隨後更陸續飛來關於敵後動部隊狀況的報告，鑿</p>
<p>軍艦隊於嚴重警戒中繼續前進，遠遠望去，敵軍機動部隊的直衝戰鬥非常衆多，日軍艦載機穿過這層層的飛機陣，直撲敵艦，實在是非常不易。某時某分，日軍機隊指揮之下，多全面拼死攻擊，發出敵艦隊上空正在空戰的報吿，接著更發出命中敵航空母艦一艘的捷報，在捷報頻傳聲中，擊破了敵軍航空母艦三艘，第一次先發制人的攻擊，收穫了偉大的功績，未幾攻擊機隊陸續歸返，同時之完成偵察艦，但也有因為天氣惡劣及中敵彈，無力降於母艦而墜於海內者。二一十日偵察機又於黎明出發索敵，水上艦船業猛烈突擊，至下午於距離相當遠的海面上，發現敵航空母艦兩艘，戰艦兩艘，和其他十餘艘艦船編成的艦隊，攻擊隊立即開始</p>
<p>薄暮攻擊　敵艦隊也於此時派遣艦載機來襲日軍，日軍接到偵察機之報告後，全艦隊立即完成對空職鬥配備，日軍暸望員不時報吿敵織火動情形，高射砲員接受命令後，立即拉開炮位，準備迎敵，敵機剛與日軍艦隊接觸，日軍艦隊即猛力射擊，上空高射砲彈爆炸，使敵機無法活動，中彈敵機連續　數千米上空翻　　下，第一深，第二架相繼被擊落，拋贅黑烟，垂直下蹤，直到夜晚，遭猛烈擊敗的敵機，幾乎潰不成軍，縱後盲亂向海中投下無數炸彈，奪隙遁逃。又日軍一部直衝職鬥機，竟以寡兵對敵反擊，敵機一架又一架連續被擊落，敵人攻擊終成徒勞，此次空戰較去年記者於某地所經騐的敵艦載機的空襲，對於艦船攻擊做術，仍相差甚遠，</p>
<p>此次戰鬥　日軍艦隊絲毫，並立即完成突擊情勢，準備夜戰。此次薄暮開始之戰鬥，敵制空式大型空母　卡　爾一艘被擊沉此時敵人即對日軍炮火　弱之油船兩艘集中攻擊，所以日軍亦曾有兩艘被炸起火，於此種大艦隊會戰中，日艦隊僅損失航空母艦一艘而已。</p>
<h3>硫黃島父島空襲　擊落敵卅餘架　中太平洋擊沉敵潛艇七艘</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電日大本營四日下午四時三十分發表：　塞班島日軍，縱續在加拉邦市塔保喬山頓尼一帶，與優勢之敵激戰。　敵機動部隊曾於七月三日空襲硫黃島，繼於四日來襲硫黃島及父島，經常地日軍邀擊，現仍激戰中。迄現在止，判明擊落敵機已達三十餘架。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電中部太平洋日軍某基地四日電，只護衛艦艇及航空部隊，連日不斷於太平洋水域監視敵潛艇之活動，七月二日於中部太平洋海面擊沉敵艇四艘，於其他海面擊沉其潛艇二艘·又三日於中部太平洋擊沉其一艘，二三兩日共擊沉敵潛艇七艘，而收獲大戰果。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電中部太平洋日軍某基地電，日戰鬥機隊，三日午前與來襲雅浦島之敵大型機編隊交戰，擊落其二架，擊毀其十架，日機一架未歸返。</p>
<h3>華南日軍各部隊　沿粵漢綫北進中　前日先後佔領龍門淸遠</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社雷華南前綫日軍某基地電，華南日軍各部隊，沿粵漢綫北進，壓制兩側地區四日晨止，日軍各部隊進攻情形如次：　粤漢鐵路兩側地區，日軍各部隊已渡過北江，隨地擊潰渝之第百五十六師之反攻，一部日軍巳在三日傍晚突入淸遠（北江沿岸要衝），更與其他部隊相呼應，現在繼續北進中。　粤漢錢東側地區北進中之日軍各部隊，已逼近隆門（廣州東北百二十公里），卒於三日上午佔領該地，仍繼續北進，追擊渝軍。又日軍曾在從化南方山岳地帶包圍渝軍，刻仍繼續作戰一中。</p>
<p>日軍前綫四日中央社電　華南日軍航空部隊，于華南日軍發動攻勢之同時開始行動，與陸地部隊之進攻緊密聯擊，掌握戰場上空之制空　，當陸地部隊于北江渡河之際，日空軍曾以猛烈之威力壓迫渝軍陣地，掩護渡河軍轟炸機隊，更反復急襲淸遠東方蜓頭嶺附近之渝軍陣地，炸碎地上軍事施設，並予該地渝軍以重大損失。其後又往襲集結于淸遠西方北江支洗之渝軍舟艇約五十艘及約三百人之兵丁，另一隊日機更攻擊淸漬縣城北方之渝軍兵舍，有四所起火，日軍之進攻雖如此熾烈，然在渝之美空軍，始終袖手旁觀，至日軍渡過江北後之二日中午前後，渝美空軍始以戰鬥轟炸機十數架來襲，于北方三十公里之軍田附近盲投炸彈，迄日機飛起直追，遂立即遁逃，渝美機之　炸，唯殺場無辜之民衆而已。</p>
<p>渝第七戰區受重壓　廣州四日中央社電華南日軍自香港陷落後，已久守沉默，此次為呼應湖南方面日軍之南下作戰，突于六月二十七日沿粵漢鐵路開始北進，渝第七戰區遂感受重壓，該戰區司令余漢謀所部第十二集團軍，過去對廣州作蹄型包圍形勢，其防衛重點，置于南方，此次日軍進攻長沙，該戰區軍為向北方移動，乃岡收縮兵力，使最精之兩軍救援長沙，然為時已遲，長沙卒入日軍手中，故渝軍企圖亦成畫餅。又傳余漢謀以防術韶關為名，擬使第三十集團罩主力北上，致使該軍之司令部所在地德慶（廣州西方）情勢備極險惡。按渝方于前年日軍進攻長沙時，推料華南日軍必將北上，乃計劃將渝廣東省政府自韶關遷連縣（韶關西方）此次似亦早已自韶關開始遁逃，于廣東省政府主席李漢魂（廣西派）與祗圖保存個人勢力之余漢謀愈形對立之時，　等對此次日華南軍之北上作戰，將出以何等態度買頗堪注目。</p>
<p>廣州四日中央社電廣西省桂林，由於日軍之進擊，極感動搖，而陷於極度混亂。據美駐淪訪員說明桂林之混亂情形稱：桂林今正呈一種錯綜複雜之混亂狀態，電信電話乃至鐵道等交通機關，亦完全斷絕，故今桂林與外部之交通聯絡，完全杜絕，甚至對於日軍在何方進攻，亦無從判明，留言四起，無法收拾，沿途均擁塞背負行李避難之人。</p>
<p>湘南日軍綜合戰果　日軍某基地四日中央社電湘南日軍佔領長沙後，更於上月二十六日佔領衡陽渝機塲，並對衡陽市開始總攻，巳可指日而下。日軍自五月二十七日開始湘南作職，以迄六月二十日所獲之綜合嚴果如次：收容渝軍屍體三五四〇〇具，俘虜一一三〇〇人，鹵獲機關砲二二九門，機槍六二五，步槍五四〇〇支，砲彈二〇四〇〇發，其他地雷子彈等甚多，並擊落渝美機三十二架，日軍陣亡一五〇三人。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　重慶來電稱：渝軍當局三日夜發表湖南戰況如次：日軍於炮火掩護下，對衡陽防衛陣地實行反復攻擊後，已將某陣地突破一處，防守該市之渝軍某師長，曾親身指揮兩連兵士以手榴彈作戰，預料日軍於增援部隊折達後，必再度來襲。一方於安仁方面南進之日軍，已轉向秦陽方面行進，而進擊至秦陽支南十六公里地區，强行渡河，並由於向西進擊之迂迴行動，已將粤漢綫遮斷，該方面之戰事已在耒陽南方十三至二十公里地方展開。又日軍右翼一日分兩部自湘鄉南下，向衡陽西北之永豐進攻，當夜於永　東北二十六公里地方，與渝軍接觸，展開激戰。</p>
<p>渝美空軍窘困已極　日軍前綫四日中一央社電華中方面渝美空均最重要前進基地衡陽機塲失陷後，該方面日軍之壓力，與華南方面日軍之急進相應，衡陽廣州間地帶及其東之地抓，現已困於日軍之包圍圈內，分社於湖南，江西，福建，廣東各地大小十數處之渝美空軍基地，今已陷入窒息之窘境，據息，渝軍已開始破壞湖南省之實慶，零陵等機場，由此可知渝美空軍之動搖與焦臟如何深刻矣。現在渝美空軍在中國西南之桂林·柳州等要衝，建設之許多基地，亦入日軍機隊之控制勢力內，而西江沿岸梧州機塲，因河水汜濫，不能使用，故渝美空軍之窮困，己達極點，前進基地既已喪失殆盡，故唯有向內地深處退避而已。</p>
<p>中央社訊此次日軍於各地發動之攻勢，實予渝方以強烈之打擊，渝方之狼狽亂情形，在外方新聞與電訊中，已充分暴露，渝方故預料日軍將隨戰局之進展，而派遣降落拿部隊，為次刻正極力講求應付方策。皺車慶中央社電，渝航空委員會，近與軍政部協同發出布吿，令各地轉令民眾，如發見日軍降落部隊降落時，應立即射殺之，同時渝方又發出禁令，警吿民眾及指示織別敵我飛機之方法，以防誤殺友軍，由此於空戰之際，如捕有乘降落傘降落時，而尙未判定其為敵軍抑友軍時，則絕不許任意殺害，必須將之遞解軍政機關姿若遭與敵人以武器抵抗時，亦須盡可能範圍內將之生擒，不許殺害云云。但眾認渝方採此種措置之根本原因，實由於過去驗渝美空軍被日機擊落，或因機件損毀降落時，多被當地人民掠去財物衣服或槍殺，常局對此，深為焦做，遂有發出上項報吿之舉，而美空軍與渝方民眾之不和，於此亦可見一斑矣。</p>
<h3>明斯克德軍退守新防綫　普波資克落入蘇軍手</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電綫中路之大攻防戰，特別激烈，蘇軍於切斷由西南及西北通至明斯克之鐵路交通後，以坦克軍隊攻擊佔領該城。事先德守軍已退至城外新防錢，故無大戰，蘇軍對退守之德軍展開猛攻，但被珍退。氈期克之東德軍力抗蘇軍，而使其包圍企圖失敗，該處德軍向西轉進作戰時，蘇軍死傷累累，德軍衝鋒反擊而克服斯托爾比斯（Stolpce在明斯克西南），蘸軍曾於該地附近切斷由巴蘭諾維契通至明斯克之鐵道。普洛資克（Polotsk隣近舊波境東北角）之西及該城巿內均有特別劇烈之戰事，德軍已由該城退至某突出點之準備陣地內。</p>

<h3>本市防空訓練　未獲預期成績　日軍防空司令部發表談話</h3>
<p>日上海陸海軍防空司令部當局，鑒於本巿防空交通規則，業經修正，為明瞭一般巿民對於該項規則是否澈底遵守，及檢查燈火管制設施之是否良好起見，特於三日夜突然施行防空訓練，經實地調査結果，仍未能收獲預期之良好成績，即保甲自警証員等，對於上項規則亦間有未能正確理解，且在燈火管制及音饗管制方面，亦頗多缺點，睦海軍防空司令當局特於四日發表談話，希望一般市民，今後應予改良，茲誌談話內容於次；</p>
<h3>待避避難訓練</h3>
<p>此次防空訓練目的，在於檢討一般市民是否能徹底實行六月二十日發表陸海軍防空司令部第二十四號佈吿所規定各點，指出各種缺點，俾供今後之改著。此次訓練以待避渚難訓練及音響交通管制，各種燈火管制為主要項目。茲檢討各地區實施狀况，其中鎮多訓練未純熟之點：　待避州難訓練二大部份，巿民濁勿論，即交通　理雖亦未能充分了解第二十四號佈吿之偵義，此點認為極屬遺憾。按照防空司令部對於指導班之指示，尙無大過，惟以待避訓練成績言，猶不能引為滿足。</p>
<h3>音響交通管制</h3>
<p>音響交通管制警戒警報發令後五分鐘內，須停止音響交通，但不明瞭此點者，仍佔大部份，且保甲自驚團員亦多不知者，例如有大多數人乘指導班或巡捕不注意時，飛奔通過馬路。又自警團等雖耳聞驚報，但仍不停止交通，或有阻斷交通，達二十分鐘，時間過長者，均非所宜，今後應加注意。待避五分篇後通行，一般情形尙稱良好，人聲極靜，但關於曾響管制，因警報發令時間內，仍按掀高聲喇叭，實屬不當。希望將發聲器加以音管制裝置，避免高聲。各種　火管制，自迭經施行管制以來，業已漸見良好，此乃因各機關努力所致。然燈火管制不良房屋，仍佔相當多數，尤自高處俯瞰洩漏燈火之房屋為數頗多，大致凡有保甲目警團活動之地域多屬良好，反之，則均漠不關心，成績極為不良。又燈火管制裝置未曾完備之車輛，約有多數，今後應予格外努力。</p>
<h3>所須注意事項</h3>
<p>所須注意事項如次：（甲）未經設有管制裝置之燈火，應與警報發出後，即予熄燈。（乙）雖有不用燈火而，有易於誤開之虞者，亦應元成遮光裝置。（丙）車輛應隨時携帶管制裝　。（丁）天窗應設有完密之管制裝置。（戊）關終以上各點，各指導機關固應徹底注意，即各保甲自警國員等，亦應互相督導，以便在各保各甲之內，絕無管制不良房屋。綜上而霄，雖尙多不充分之點，然大致尙屬良好，此次訓練完全出於不意，故一般多未能知悉究係正實燈火管制，抑係訓緻燈火管制。以後應當時準備，不可或忽，切不可以為訓練性做，而即敷衍塞責，形式從事。本月九日防空訓練日，即將來臨，希望全體巿民徹底暸解吿示旨趣，以獲得格外良好成績為要。</p>
<h3>妨礙鐵道運輸　將依軍法嚴懲　日軍當局嚴禁偷竊材料</h3>
<p>中國自參戰後，即負有重大之使命，如增加生　產，强化運輸，及確保治安諍，惟最近各地運輸途中，或各車站及棧房等，時有物件被竊情事之發生，關係當局，對此深為不　，且甚至連一般鐵道之設施及各項材料，亦時有妝現偸盜。此玆不良現象一，對今後重要物炎之運輸，及戰事之進行，均有莫大影響·故日本陸軍當局對今後本輛附屬品之被倫竊，及鐵路棧之遭破壞，以及有妨礙運輸行動者，均將一律施用軍法，予以嚴厲懲戒。</p>

        <h1>1944.07.05</h1>
<h3>Editorial: Advance</h3>
<p>On the battlefield, in times of decisive battles, there must be no hesitation, no lingering, only advance. A step backward is a dead end, a step forward is the path to survival. In times of war for a nation, the soldiers at the front must advance, and the people in the rear must advance even more; with unity between front and rear, the nation can then achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Everyone must first make a resolute decision to advance, and strive for progress at all times. Whether in thought or in action, one must have a broad vision and absolutely not be complacent or self-satisfied, thereby hindering the path of development and progress. Present comforts are not permanent comforts, and the present is only a transitional phase. Whether the transition is good or bad depends entirely on one's own efforts. One must not harbor a psychology of dependence. External forces can at most help people advance, but there is no way to assist those who do not advance themselves. The time of decisive battle has arrived, and the world's nations are nearing the finish line in their race. At this critical moment, one must be most careful. A moment of slackness will undo all previous efforts. An effort made now is worth ten times the effort made in the past, and a step forward now is worth ten times the steps taken in the past. As the saying goes, Heaven helps those who help themselves. One must first help oneself, and then one can receive Heaven's help. For those who do not strive to advance, there is no second path besides retreating and perishing.</p>
<p>Everyone must also have the courage to work hard with their heads down and never give up, and at all times fear no difficulties and bravely move forward. There is no such thing as success through luck in the world, and any success that is achieved by luck is certainly not permanent success; this is a common example in history. The Greater East Asia War is a natural trend of resistance from the people under a century of oppression by Britain and the United States. Therefore, the success of the Greater East Asia War is inevitable and a logical certainty. However, because of the historical circumstances of the past century, the enemy will certainly use the greatest force to maintain the interests they have plundered. The greater our resistance, the greater the enemy's oppression will increase. Now that we are in the final five minutes, the enemy will use even greater force in a last-ditch effort. This is decisive, and in an instant, it can determine the future of our liberation and freedom. Therefore, the greater the force of oppression, the more resolute our fighting spirit will be; the more difficult the environment, the more high-spirited our spirit will be. We must calmly cope and advance steadily. We are enduring some hardship and suffering now. Is there anything in the world more worthwhile than this?</p>
<p>Everyone must also have a spirit of sharing the same boat and enduring hardships together, and at all times be selfless and fight together for the common good. Now is not the time to seek personal gain, and now is not the time to seek individual enjoyment. Everyone must first prioritize the entire nation, and absolutely not be limited by personal interests. Everyone must first prioritize relieving the suffering of the nation, and absolutely not only seek personal pleasure. Everything is part of a whole, and the individual is only a part of the whole. The survival of the whole is the highest guarantee of the individual's survival. At the same time, difficulties must be conquered with the common strength of everyone, and the revival of the nation is the result of the efforts of all citizens, and cannot be borne by one or two individuals. Therefore, everyone has a common "public" goal, and everyone fights together toward this goal. This is the only way to overcome the current difficulties, and it is the responsibility that all citizens should bear during wartime.</p>
<p>Correction: In the editorial on July 1st, in the article "After the Adjustment of the Business Association," in the final paragraph, the first item under the sentence "As for the important issues at present" was slightly misaligned. The correction is as follows: "The work of purchasing cotton cloth should be completed as soon as possible. There are occasional complexities and confusions in the temporary rationing work, which should be remedied. For this purpose, the liquidation committee of the Cotton Industry Administration should be adjusted and strengthened immediately to take responsibility."</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency report: According to a report on the 3rd by a member of the Japanese military warship reporting team: The Battle of the Mariana Sea was actually</p>
<h3>A Preemptive Strike</h3>
<p>A decisive naval battle for the rise and fall of Japan. The first attack was launched by the Japanese naval air force on the morning of June 19th, initially establishing the achievement of destroying several enemy aircraft carriers. Later, they carried out attacks and night raids at dusk, and submarines also came out to operate actively, thus increasing the results of the battle. On a certain day in June, a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet, believing that the time had come, prepared to enthusiastically set out. It is reported that the strength of the enemy forces attacked this time included more than a dozen battleships, about ten formal aircraft carriers, more than a dozen specially made aircraft carriers, plus cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., totaling more than a hundred ships. It can be said that most of the naval force in the Pacific was poured out to launch a large-scale attack. From the 11th to the 18th, they used over a thousand carrier-based aircraft, which they boasted about, frequently bombing the Japanese air force bases in the Mariana Islands. On the other hand, the naval vessels on the sea were also approaching step by step, advancing to the vicinity of the Mariana Islands to carry out naval bombardment. On the 15th, they even landed on Saipan Island. This reckless advance aroused the Japanese military's</p>
<h3>Combined Fleet</h3>
<p>A desire to annihilate the enemy. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet then gathered in a certain place to actively prepare for battle. On the afternoon of a certain day, the commander of the fleet sent out by the Japanese Combined Fleet gave a profound instruction to his subordinates, saying: "Our forces will go to destroy the enemy's arrogance. Please use all your strength to fight." All the personnel of the fleet sent out were very excited upon receiving this instruction, from the captain to the soldiers. On the 18th, they majestically advanced towards the waters where the enemy fleet was active. The 19th was the day of the decisive battle. The sky was still dark and not yet bright when the enemy planes jointly set out. A moment later, the red sun slowly rose, and the enemy planes discovered the enemy mobile units. First, they reported that the enemy mobile units were now in the sea west of the Mariana Islands, divided into about three groups: the first group consisted of four formal aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than a dozen other ships; the second group consisted of three formal aircraft carriers, five battleships, and more than a dozen other ships; the third group consisted of one formal aircraft carrier, one specially made aircraft carrier, one battleship, and about ten other ships. Subsequently, more and more reports came about the situation of the enemy's rear mobile units. The Japanese</p>
<p>fleet continued to advance under heavy guard. Looking into the distance, the enemy mobile units were engaging in a very large number of dogfights. It was very difficult for the Japanese carrier-based aircraft to break through this layer upon layer of aircraft formation and pounce directly on the enemy ships. At a certain time and minute, under the command of the Japanese air force team, they launched a full-scale, desperate attack and reported that they were engaging in aerial combat in the sky above the enemy fleet. Then, they sent out the good news that they had hit an enemy aircraft carrier. Amidst the frequent reports of victory, they destroyed three enemy aircraft carriers. The first preemptive strike reaped great achievements. Before long, the attack aircraft teams returned one after another, while reconnaissance ships were completed. However, some were unable to land on the mother ship due to bad weather and enemy fire and crashed into the sea. On the 20th, reconnaissance planes set out again at dawn to search for the enemy, and surface ships launched fierce attacks. In the afternoon, at a considerable distance, they discovered a fleet composed of two enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The attack team immediately began</p>
<p>A dusk attack. At this time, the enemy fleet also sent carrier-based aircraft to attack the Japanese army. After receiving the report from the reconnaissance plane, the entire Japanese fleet immediately completed its anti-aircraft combat preparations. Japanese lookouts frequently reported on the enemy's firing situation. After receiving orders, the anti-aircraft gunners immediately opened their gun positions to prepare to meet the enemy. As soon as the enemy planes made contact with the Japanese fleet, the Japanese fleet immediately opened fire fiercely. Anti-aircraft shells exploded in the sky, making it impossible for the enemy planes to maneuver. Enemy planes that were hit continuously somersaulted down from thousands of meters in the sky. The first and second planes were shot down one after another, spewing black smoke and falling vertically until night. The enemy planes that had been severely defeated were almost routed. They blindly dropped countless bombs into the sea and fled in disarray. In addition, a part of the Japanese army's direct assault fighting planes unexpectedly launched a counterattack against the enemy with a small number of troops. One enemy plane after another was continuously shot down. The enemy's attack ended in vain. This aerial battle was still far behind the enemy carrier-based aircraft's air raid attack techniques on warships that the reporter had experienced in a certain place last year.</p>
<p>In this battle, the Japanese fleet was unharmed, and immediately completed the assault situation, preparing for a night battle. In this battle that began at dusk, one of the enemy's large "制空式" aircraft carriers, the "卡尔" (likely referring to the USS Card), was sunk. At this time, the enemy concentrated its attack on two oil tankers of the Japanese army with weak firepower. Therefore, two Japanese ships were also set on fire by bombs. In this kind of large fleet battle, the Japanese fleet only lost one aircraft carrier.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, Over 30 Enemy Planes Shot Down, Seven Enemy Submarines Sunk in the Central Pacific</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 4th: The Japanese army on Saipan Island continues to engage in fierce battles with the superior enemy in the areas of Garapan City, Mount Tapochau, and Donnay. The enemy mobile units raided Iwo Jima on July 3rd, and then raided Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima on the 4th. The Japanese army intercepted them frequently, and fierce battles are still ongoing. So far, it has been confirmed that more than 30 enemy planes have been shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported on the 4th that escort vessels and air force units have been constantly monitoring the activities of enemy submarines in the Pacific waters for days. On July 2nd, they sank four enemy submarines in the Central Pacific, and sank two other submarines in other waters. On the 3rd, they sank another one in the Central Pacific. On the 2nd and 3rd, they sank a total of seven enemy submarines, reaping great results.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported that the Japanese fighter plane team engaged with a formation of large enemy planes that attacked Yap Island on the morning of the 3rd, shooting down two of them and destroying ten of them. One Japanese plane did not return.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in South China Advance Northward Along the Canton-Hankow Railway, Capturing Longmen and Qingyuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: A certain Japanese base on the South China front reported that the Japanese troops in South China are advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, suppressing the areas on both sides. As of the morning of the 4th, the situation of the Japanese troops' offensive is as follows: In the areas on both sides of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the Japanese troops have crossed the North River and crushed the counterattacks of Yu's (Chongqing's) 156th Division. A part of the Japanese troops broke into Qingyuan (a key point along the North River) on the evening of the 3rd, and are now echoing with other troops, continuing to advance northward. In the area east of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the Japanese troops advancing northward have approached Longmen (120 kilometers northeast of Guangzhou) and finally captured the area on the morning of the 3rd, continuing to advance northward and pursue the Yu army. In addition, the Japanese army encircled the Yu army in the mountainous area south of Conghua and is still continuing the battle.</p>
<p>Japanese Front Line, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese air force in South China began operations at the same time as the Japanese army in South China launched its offensive. Closely linked with the land troops' offensive, they controlled the airspace over the battlefield. When the land troops were crossing the North River, the Japanese air force used its fierce power to suppress the Yu army's positions and cover the river-crossing troops. The bomber squadrons repeatedly and urgently attacked the Yu army's positions near Tingtou Ridge in the east of Qingyuan, blowing up ground military facilities and inflicting heavy losses on the Yu army in the area. Afterwards, they attacked about fifty Yu army boats and about three hundred soldiers gathered on the North River tributary west of Qingyuan. Another team of Japanese planes attacked the Yu army barracks north of Qingyuan County, setting four of them on fire. Although the Japanese army's offensive was so fierce, the US air force in Yu remained on the sidelines. It was not until noon on the 2nd, after the Japanese army had crossed the North River, that the Yu-US air force raided with a dozen fighter-bombers, blindly dropping bombs near Juntian, thirty kilometers north, and fled immediately after the Japanese planes took off in pursuit. The bombing by Yu-US planes only killed innocent civilians.</p>
<p>The Seventh War Zone of Yu is Under Heavy Pressure. Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in South China has remained silent for a long time since the fall of Hong Kong. This time, to respond to the Japanese army's southward operation in Hunan, they suddenly began to advance northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway on June 27th, and the Seventh War Zone of Yu was under heavy pressure. The 12th Army Group under the command of Yu Hanmou, commander of the war zone, had previously formed a horseshoe-shaped encirclement of Guangzhou, and its defensive focus was placed in the south. This time, the Japanese army attacked Changsha, and the war zone's army was moving north, so it had to shrink its forces and send the two most elite armies to rescue Changsha. However, it was too late, and Changsha eventually fell into the hands of the Japanese army, so the Yu army's attempt also became a pie in the sky. It is also said that Yu Hanmou, under the pretext of defending Shaoguan, planned to have the main force of the 30th Army Group move north, causing the situation in Deqing (west of Guangzhou), where the army's headquarters was located, to be extremely dangerous. According to Yu, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha the year before last, it was predicted that the Japanese army in South China would definitely move north, so it was planned to move the Yu Guangdong Provincial Government from Shaoguan to Lian County (west of Shaoguan). This time, it seems that they had already started fleeing from Shaoguan. At a time when the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li Hanmou (Guangxi faction), and Yu Hanmou, who was only trying to preserve his personal power, were increasingly opposed to each other, it is noteworthy what attitude they will take towards this northward operation of the Japanese South China Army.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency: Guilin, Guangxi Province, is extremely shaken and in extreme chaos due to the Japanese army's attack. According to a US reporter in Chongqing, the chaos in Guilin is described as follows: Guilin is now in a complex state of chaos. Communication organs such as telegraph, telephone, and even railroads are completely cut off. Therefore, Guilin's communication with the outside world is completely cut off. It is impossible to determine where the Japanese army is attacking from. Rumors are spreading everywhere, and it is impossible to control the situation. The roads are congested with people carrying luggage to escape.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Battle Results of the Japanese Army in Southern Hunan. A Certain Japanese Base, July 4th, Central News Agency: After occupying Changsha, the Japanese army in southern Hunan occupied Hengyang Airport on the 26th of last month and began a general offensive against Hengyang City, which is expected to fall soon. The comprehensive results of the Japanese army's campaign in southern Hunan from May 27th to June 20th are as follows: 35,400 Yu army corpses were recovered, 11,300 prisoners were captured, 229 machine guns, 625 machine guns, 5,400 rifles, 20,400 shells, and many other landmines and bullets were seized. In addition, 32 Yu-US planes were shot down, and 1,503 Japanese soldiers were killed in action.</p>
<p>Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency: A telegram from Chongqing stated that the Yu army authorities announced the war situation in Hunan on the night of the 3rd as follows: After repeatedly attacking the defensive positions of Hengyang under the cover of artillery fire, the Japanese army has broken through a certain position in one place. A certain division commander of the Yu army defending the city personally commanded two companies of soldiers to fight with hand grenades. It is expected that the Japanese army will attack again after reinforcements arrive. On the other hand, the Japanese army advancing southward in the direction of Anren has turned towards Qinyang and has advanced to the area sixteen kilometers south of Qinyang, forcibly crossing the river, and has cut off the Canton-Hankow Railway through a westward flanking action. The battle in that area has unfolded thirteen to twenty kilometers south of Leiyang. In addition, the right wing of the Japanese army advanced south from Xiangxiang in two groups on the 1st, attacking Yongfeng, northwest of Hengyang. That night, they made contact with the Yu army twenty-six kilometers northeast of Yongfeng and engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>The Yu-US Air Force is in Extreme Distress. Japanese Front Line, July 4th, Central News Agency: After the fall of Hengyang Airport, the most important forward base of the Yu-US Air Force in Central China, the pressure from the Japanese army in that area, corresponding to the rapid advance of the Japanese army in South China, has now trapped the area between Hengyang and Guangzhou and the areas east of it within the Japanese army's encirclement. It is said that the dozen or so Yu-US air force bases, large and small, scattered in Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong have now fallen into a suffocating predicament. It is reported that the Yu army has begun to destroy the airports in Hunan Province, such as Shiqing and Lingling, from which it can be seen how deep the Yu-US air force's unrest and anxiety are. Now, many bases built by the Yu-US air force in key points such as Guilin and Liuzhou in southwestern China have also entered the control of the Japanese air force's power, and the Wuzhou Airport along the West River cannot be used due to flooding. Therefore, the poverty of the Yu-US air force has reached its limit. Now that the advanced bases have been lost, they can only retreat to the depths of the interior.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report: The offensive launched by the Japanese army in various places this time has dealt a strong blow to Yu, and Yu's chaotic situation has been fully exposed in foreign news and telegrams. Yu is therefore anticipating that the Japanese army will dispatch landing troops as the war progresses, and is now vigorously seeking countermeasures. Chongqing, Central News Agency report: The Yu Aviation Commission recently issued a notice in conjunction with the Ministry of Military Administration, ordering various places to order the people that if they find Japanese landing troops landing, they should immediately shoot them. At the same time, Yu also issued a ban, warning the people and instructing them on how to distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft, to prevent accidental killing of friendly troops. Therefore, during air battles, if a parachute is captured and it has not yet been determined whether it is an enemy or friendly soldier, it is absolutely not allowed to kill him arbitrarily. He must be handed over to the military and political organs. If he resists with weapons, he must be captured alive as far as possible and not be killed. However, many people believe that the fundamental reason for Yu's adoption of this measure is actually because in the past, when Yu-US air force personnel were shot down by Japanese planes or landed due to mechanical damage, their property, clothes, or guns were often looted or killed by the local people. The authorities are deeply anxious about this, so they have issued the above report, and the discord between the US air force and the people of Yu can also be seen from this.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Minsk Retreat to New Defense Line, Popozik Falls into Soviet Hands</h3>
<p>Berlin, July 4th, Central News Agency: The large-scale defense battle in the central sector of the front is particularly fierce. After cutting off the railway traffic from the southwest and northwest to Minsk, the Soviet army attacked and occupied the city with tank troops. In advance, the German garrison had retreated to a new defensive line outside the city, so there was no major battle. The Soviet army launched a fierce attack on the retreating German troops, but was repelled. The German army east of Minsk resisted the Soviet army and thwarted their encirclement attempt. When the German army in that area was turning westward to fight, the Soviet army suffered heavy casualties. The German army launched a counterattack and overcame Stolpce (southwest of Minsk). The Soviet army had cut off the railway from Baranovichi to Minsk near that area. There were particularly fierce battles west of Polotsk (adjacent to the northeastern corner of the old border) and within the city. The German army has withdrawn from the city to a prepared position at a certain salient point.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 4th, Central News Agency: The German authorities announced at noon on the 3rd that the focus of the Eastern Front is now in the Minsk area. The German army is now withdrawing from the Oshivyeki crossing, steaming the Sina River, towards the Minsk area, concentrating its forces to intercept the Soviet army. The front line extends for 400 kilometers and is about 200 kilometers wide, with the positions jagged and intertwined, entering a state of mixed war.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence Movement, Plans and Guidelines, Chairman Bose Clearly Elaborates</h3>
<p>Rangoon, July 4th, Central News Agency: July 4th is the first anniversary of Mr. Bose's inauguration as the President of the Indian Independence League and Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army. It has been decided to designate from this day to the 10th as "Bose's Inauguration Celebration Memorial Week". During this week, all Indian households will hoist the Indian tricolor flag, and each branch will hold demonstrations and mass rallies. On this day, Bose issued a statement elaborating on the future plans and guidelines of the Indian independence movement, which are recorded as follows: The Indian National Army has crossed the Indian border to fight a holy war in various places to win freedom. Now, due to the progress of the new situation, new problems have arisen, namely, how to carry out administration and reconstruction in the various parts of India that have been liberated. In addition, there is the question of how to carry out military operations in India and how to complete the great cause of revolution. There are three areas of activity for us in the future: East Asia, which is still the base of our political and military activities; the liberated areas, where the current issues are administration and reconstruction, and preparing for future revolutionary struggles; and the Indian areas occupied by the British enemy, which are also revolutionary areas that must be completed. Since the scope of activities of the Provisional Government of India includes the above three places, the Provisional Government must, in terms of responsibility, assign key personnel and advisers of the government in the above three areas: the first group to pay attention to various activities in East Asia, the second group to be assigned to the liberated areas, and the third group to be assigned to the British enemy-occupied areas to engage in revolutionary work. The first group in East Asia is called the "East Asia Cabinet Committee", the second group in the liberated areas is called the "Cabinet Liberated Areas Committee", and the third group is called the "Cabinet Wartime Committee". However, in order to strengthen the overall mobilization of manpower, materials, and financial resources in East Asia, it is necessary to establish new administrative organs or expand existing organizations to implement new policies. The East Asia Committee is the guiding institution responsible for East Asia activities, formed by key personnel and advisors active in East Asia. The liberated areas have prepared for the implementation of administrative and reconstruction plans, which can be implemented at an appropriate time, and important personnel have been dispatched properly. They have now arrived in India and the border areas. The Liberated Areas Committee is composed of specially selected key personnel and advisers who meet the needs, as well as existing key personnel and advisors. The main task of the final Wartime Committee is related to military fortresses and propaganda in the areas occupied by the British enemy, and is composed of key personnel and advisors reviewed by those who specialize in revolutionary movements and administrators. The Provisional Government of India, in order to make the three committees closely connected, will concentrate future activities in the center, so as to achieve the greatest results and achieve the supreme goal of Indian independence.</p>

He also introduced Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency, and Zhang Ke, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Propaganda, to meet with the entire group, and the two men expressed their aspirations, and the situation was very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>American Troops on Italian West Coast Reach Cecina</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency, German News Agency): According to the German News Agency, on the 3rd, the German army withdrew from Siena, sparing the Italian cultural center from the ravages of war. After the defending forces retreated to favorable positions north of the town, they repeatedly repelled fierce attacks by the Tegor troops. Currently, the focus of the Italian war is on the Volterra area (northwest of Siena) along the Tyrrhenian coast and southwest and southeast of Siena. As for the American troops along the coastal area, they have advanced to Cecina and several locations a few kilometers north of the town. Fierce fighting west of Lake Trasimeno continued late into the night. German divisions operating in the area repelled a strong enemy tank attack during the day and retreated to the surrounding highlands north of the lake in the evening. On the Adriatic coast, Polish divisions, under the cover of British tanks, continued to launch strong attacks at several key points. The German army had to retreat to the main front line. In the evening, the Polish army attempted to break into the German defenses, and fierce fighting resumed in the area. The enemy was finally repelled. German outposts retreated several kilometers.</p>
<h3>American Troops in Cotentin Launch New Offensive: German Outposts Retreat Several Kilometers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency, German News Agency): According to various sources: On Monday, the British Second Army was relatively quiet on the European front, but in the afternoon, the American army intensified its offensive between the Carentan area and the west coast of Normandy. Several German outposts retreated several kilometers to allow for better German resistance. American casualties were extremely heavy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): According to front-line reports: At about 5 a.m. on the 3rd, American troops on the Cotentin Peninsula launched an offensive from the area west of the coast from Barneville-sur-Mer southwest of Cherbourg to the area west of Carentan, a distance of about forty miles. After being intercepted by the German army, fierce fighting is now underway. It is reported that the American army plans to use Saint-Sauveur and the area south of La Vicomté as the center of the attack and attempt to advance south towards La Haye-du-Puits.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): Combined front-line reports: A fierce attack planned by the British army to destroy the most elite armored units under General Rommel has been completely thwarted. The British army, realizing the extent of the damage, temporarily abandoned this idea, and the situation on that front has become deadlocked. However, Montgomery is actively reinforcing troops and supplies, so the situation will soon become active again. At the same time, the German army is also preparing for the next operation. Reuters reported that General Rommel is currently reorganizing eleven divisions in the Tilly-sur-Seulles area to strengthen the defensive posture.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Training in This City Fails to Achieve Expected Results: Japanese Military Air Defense Headquarters Issues Statement</h3>
<p>In view of the revision of the air defense traffic regulations in this city, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Air Defense Headquarters authorities, in order to understand whether the general public thoroughly abide by these regulations and to check whether the lighting control facilities are in good condition, suddenly conducted air defense training on the night of the 3rd. After on-site investigation, the expected good results were still not achieved. Even the Baojia (neighborhood watch) and self-defense members failed to correctly understand the above regulations, and there were many shortcomings in lighting control and sound control. The Naval Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued a statement on the 4th, hoping that the general public will improve in the future. The contents of the statement are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Shelter and Evacuation Training</h3>
<p>The purpose of this air defense training is to review whether the general public can thoroughly implement the various points stipulated in Announcement No. 24 of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued on June 20, point out various shortcomings, and provide for future improvements. This training focuses on shelter and evacuation training, sound and traffic control, and various lighting controls. After reviewing the implementation in various districts, there are many points where the training is not proficient: In the two major parts of shelter and evacuation training, the public, not to mention the traffic police, also failed to fully understand the meaning of Announcement No. 24, which is considered extremely regrettable. According to the instructions of the Air Defense Headquarters for the guidance teams, there is no major fault, but in terms of the results of the shelter training, it is still not satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Sound and Traffic Control</h3>
<p>Sound and traffic control: Sound and traffic must be stopped within five minutes after the issuance of the alarm, but most people do not understand this point, and many Baojia self-defense members are also unaware of it. For example, the majority of people run across the road when the guidance team or the police are not paying attention. In addition, even if the self-defense groups hear the alarm, they still do not stop traffic, or block traffic for 20 minutes, which is too long and should be avoided in the future. The situation is generally good for traffic passing five minutes after sheltering, and the sound of people is extremely quiet, but regarding sound control, it is inappropriate to still use loud speakers during the alarm. It is hoped that a sound control device will be added to the sound generators to avoid loud noises. Various lighting controls have gradually improved since the implementation of control, which is due to the efforts of various agencies. However, a considerable number of houses with poor lighting control still exist, especially houses that leak light when viewed from above. Generally, areas where Baojia and self-defense groups are active are mostly good, but on the contrary, they are indifferent and the results are extremely poor. In addition, a large number of vehicles have not completed the lighting control device and should make extra efforts in the future.</p>
<h3>Matters Needing Attention</h3>
<p>Matters needing attention are as follows: (A) Lights that have not been equipped with a control device should be turned off immediately after the alarm is issued. (B) Even if lights are not used, if there is a risk of being accidentally turned on, a complete light-shielding device should be installed. (C) Vehicles should always carry control devices. (D) Skylights should be equipped with a complete control device. (E) All guidance agencies should thoroughly pay attention to the above points, and Baojia self-defense members should also supervise each other so that there are no poorly controlled houses within each Bao and Jia. In summary, although there are still many insufficient points, the general situation is still good. This training was completely unexpected, so most people did not know whether it was real lighting control or training lighting control. In the future, preparations should be made at all times and should not be neglected. Do not assume that it is training and simply perfunctorily do things in a formalistic manner. The Air Defense Training Day on the 9th of this month is approaching, and it is hoped that all citizens will thoroughly understand the purpose of the announcement in order to achieve exceptionally good results.</p>
<h3>Obstructing Railway Transportation Will Be Severely Punished According to Military Law: Japanese Military Authorities Strictly Prohibit Theft of Materials</h3>
<p>Since China's participation in the war, it has shouldered a major mission, such as increasing production, strengthening transportation, and ensuring public security. However, recently, incidents of theft of objects have occurred frequently during transportation in various places, or at various stations and warehouses. The relevant authorities are deeply concerned about this, and even general railway facilities and various materials are sometimes stolen. This bad phenomenon has a great impact on the transportation of important materials and the progress of the war in the future. Therefore, the Japanese Army authorities will strictly punish any theft of vehicle accessories and damage to railway warehouses, as well as any actions that obstruct transportation, in accordance with military law.</p>
<h3>Three Control Committees to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>The National Government is strengthening the materials control mechanism and will reorganize the main commodity agencies under the Business Control Committee, such as rice, flour, oil, and cotton, into control committees. The Rice Control Committee will remain unchanged, the Flour and Wheat Control Committee has been reorganized and established, and the Oil Control Committee has been ordered to expedite its closure and will be formally reorganized into a control committee in the near future. The Cotton Management Office will be merged into the Cotton Control Committee and renamed the Cotton Control Committee, which is also being prepared for reorganization. Regarding the Daily Necessities Control Committee, Director Luo Naizhai is currently convening members from various industries to actively prepare for its organization and will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Three Coolie Laborers Fall into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>A tragic incident occurred at the Yangshi Wharf in Pudong at about 7 a.m. on the 1st, in which three passengers on a sampan fell into the Huangpu River and drowned. The details are as follows: Mao Yongshun, a coolie laborer, 20 years old, from Ningbo, Xu Yueqing, 33 years old, and Xi Liangnian, 27 years old, each carrying fifty or sixty catties of lead, arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the Zisheng steamer, attempting to sell them for profit. After the steamer arrived at the Yangshi Wharf in Pudong at 7 a.m. on the 1st and stopped, Mao and the other two were lowered from the steamer onto a sampan to go ashore. Unexpectedly, Xu Jianye, nicknamed Xu Erxiazi, the so-called "insurance head" (i.e., sampan boss), discovered that Mao and the others were heavily loaded and knew that they were carrying goods, so when Mao was about to go ashore, he ordered him not to go ashore. Mao Yongshun was suddenly startled, panicked, and fell into the Huangpu River. Xu and Xi immediately tried to rescue him, but because their bodies were heavy, not only did they not save him, but they all fell into the river one after another. Mao had already disappeared. Xu and Xi, seeing the opportunity, immediately untied the lead so they could float up. They climbed onto another sampan parked next to the dock. At this critical moment, the sampan rower demanded 30,000 yuan for saving their lives. At the same time, Xu Jianye ordered them not to rescue, so the sampans were forced by Xu's power and dared not rescue them. Xu and Xi drowned one after another. After the port police learned of the incident, they salvaged the bodies and notified their families to come to Shanghai to collect them, and ordered the arrest of the suspect Xu.</p>
<h3>Baojia Office Sends Commissioners to Answer Citizens' Questions</h3>
<p>The First Police Department Baojia Office, in order to facilitate the people in the district in consulting on the procedures for applying for household registration changes and obtaining residence permits, and to prevent the heads of households from deliberately making things difficult or demanding bribes when requesting seals and proof of residents' moving in and out, which caused the public to suffer, has specially appointed commissioners from the main section to handle guidance work in order to reduce all disputes. All people within the First Police Department’s jurisdiction, if there are unclear Baojia procedures or various questions, can consult the section by writing, telephone, or directly, and they will be answered and guided in detail. If there are unscrupulous Baojia staff and household heads deliberately making things difficult or demanding money, please report the facts for verification and handling to benefit the people. The office is located at Room 601, 6th Floor, Jiangxi Road Construction Building, telephone number 10294.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sheng Youqi Donates a Large Sum of Money to Help Education, Diverting 500,000 Yuan from Birthday Celebrations</h3>
<p>Mr. Sheng Youqi is enthusiastic about education and spares no effort. He has been particularly supportive of the newspaper's education fund, generously donating large sums of money in the past. Today is Mr. Sheng's 70th birthday. Because of the difficult times, he did not want to be extravagant and diverted the funds for the celebrations to donate 500,000 yuan to the newspaper's education fund and 500,000 yuan to the Xinwen Bao scholarship fund. The newspaper is grateful for Mr. Sheng's past support and sent a birthday gift of 20,000 yuan, and Mr. Chen, the president of the newspaper, sent a birthday gift of 10,000 yuan, which were all donated to the education fund. Mr. Sheng wrote in a letter yesterday: "The 5th of this month is my 70th birthday. I am grateful to my relatives and friends for their kind intentions to celebrate, but given the current situation, there is no reason to celebrate. The family will also not eat noodles. I have managed to raise 1 million Central Reserve Bonds and give 500,000 yuan each to your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao as education funds." Mr. Sheng's individual donation to education is the largest amount to date. Diverting funds for celebrations to benefit poor and out-of-school children and cultivate talents for the country and society is particularly meaningful and worthy of emulation. When we receive the donation, we respectfully extend our wishes on behalf of the students benefiting from the donation: May Mr. Sheng be blessed with boundless happiness.</p>
<p>Received donations yesterday: Mr. Sheng Youqi, 500,000 yuan; Mr. Sheng Youqi's birthday gift transferred to donation, 30,000 yuan. Total received Central Reserve Bonds 530,000 yuan, settled at 3,935,274 yuan. More than 20 people arrested for opium and gambling.</p>
<h3>Laozha Police Precinct Cracks Down on Prostitution and Gambling Houses: More Than 20 Opium and Gambling Offenders Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, the municipal authorities have been strictly prohibiting opium and gambling, and the major gambling dens and opium dens in the South City have been closed down one after another. However, the gamblers and opium addicts have come up with strange ideas and made the brothels and prostitutes their dens. Some unscrupulous brothels, only interested in profit, have been happy to provide them with a place to gamble, even turning on the lights for the customers to gamble wildly. The Laoza Police Precinct learned of this and secretly sent detectives to Huileyi and Qunwangfang to investigate. They discovered that four brothels, Yuting, Shenying, Chen Shaolou, etc., were all involved in opium and gambling. The detectives took more than 20 opium and gambling offenders and evidence such as opium lamps, opium pipes, and gambling tools to the police station for investigation and handed them over to the procuratorate for questioning. The Shanghai Bund wharves have been unified managed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, and there are assigned management personnel on duty at the wharves to manage all matters at the wharves. However, recently, so-called "scalpers" have been mixing in the wharves, using intimidation and even stealing passengers' belongings, which is harmful to travelers. The Huangpu Police Precinct in charge is paying close attention to this and has dispatched more police officers to the various wharves to work with the wharf management personnel of the Bureau of Public Utilities to maintain order and strictly crack down on illegal gangs, prohibiting scoundrels from mixing into the wharves.
