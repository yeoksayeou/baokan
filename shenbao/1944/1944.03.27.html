<p>社評</p>
<h3>全民戰爭與民意機關</h3>
<p>現代戰爭是全民戰爭。全民戰爭的意義有兩點：策一，在全民戰爭的過程中，地無分東南西北，人無分男女老幼，都要受到戰爭的影響。第二，為爭取最後的勝利，在全民戰爭的過租中，必須全團人民個個自動的參加戰爭工作，貢獻他們的人力物力，把全國的力量凝結成一個固體，方才能夠摧敵致勝。</p>
<p>全民戰爭需要一個賢明的領袖，一個堅強的政府。領袖和政府的責任，並不在消極地防止國民的反對，而在積極地謀得國民的擁護，，以獲得全民的合作。怎樣才能達到這個目的？惟一的方法就在設立民意機關，做一個政府和國民間的溝通路綫。</p>
<p>政府當局不必顧慮國民的反對，賢明的政府可以把反對的民衆變做竭誠的擁護者，怎樣做法呢？就在解釋，要一件一件的解釋，使民衆澈底明白，毫無反對的餘地，民衆自然澈底的擁護。政府不能向每一個人去解釋，所以民衆代表所組織的民意機關自然是一個最簡便的對象。政府要全國國民都知道，這個戰爭並非為某一黨，某一派，某一人而戰，而是為全國民族現在和將來的利益而戰。政府的舉措要件件都為全民打算，件件都謀全民福利，件件都替全民解除困難。這些都不能夠空言了事，而要事事見諸實行。假如要府並不這樣做，那末政府不能阻止國民的反對。假如政府眞誠地為全民福利而苦幹，那不，政府正好利用民意機關來說明，來解釋。除了軍事秘密之外，無論政治上，經濟上，文化上任何事件，是眞實為民衆的，自然都可以坦白地吿訴民衆。實施時的困難，賣施時的阻得，更可偕這個機會要求民衆的合作，以求推行的便利·政府要做到「無事不可對人言」，國民自然也是「無事不擁護」了。</p>
<p>全民　　時，　　也不　　政府的　迫，國民負担的加重，國民生活的困難。國民可以把這些情況向賢明的政府訴說，要求政府的改善。向誰去訴說呢？自然最簡便的就是民意機關。有些負擔是坃法減輕的，有些困難是無法避免的，政府就可借重民意機關，代表政府向人民說明。有些負擔是可以減輕的，有些困難是可以避免的，那末，民意機關就是政府的耳目，政府應當依照民意設法減輕，設法避免。政府的美意善策，每每因爲執行的人事，執行的方法，造成相反的結果。這些人事上方法上的錯誤，政府視聽不及，而　害人民不淺，可以影響人民心理。無如人民有向民意機關訴言的機會，民情上達，政府就可立刻整頓改善。這樣的政府，任何人願意服從，任何人願意擁護。這樣的國民處然任何力量都願意自動的貢獻出來。</p>
<p>上下一心，內外一致，然後方能意志集中，能力集中，然後方能克敵致果，獲得最後的勝利。民意機關就是促成的媒介，所以我們不辭一而再的提出來，希望大家注意。</p>
<h3>日印軍勢如破竹　向伊姆法爾推進　英軍正沿仁巴爾公路遺退</h3>
<p>里斯本二十大日中央社電　印種戰綫曰印軍，已由三面突人印度境內，紛碎英印軍第十四軍之抵抗，鐵行潔入印境中。茲據美聯社電稱，日印軍巳到達距伊姆法蘭二十喱之地，目前正與英印軍激戰中。據美聯社記者二十四日訊，日印單自於加飽溪谷之密林地帶及琴丘陵發動攻勢以來，業遮斷伊姆法爾至梯迭姆間之通路，英印第十四軍，現在正以孤軍頑強抵抗中。日軍刻正沿羅克運克湖潮濕地帶西邊與南方之公路，進迫距離伊姆法爾二十理之地點。同時第二路日軍，巳輕由伊姆法爾東南四十哩之達姆，而抵達伊姆法爾街道，復沿伊姆法爾街這向西北進發，沿途排除英軍之抵抗，刻已進抵距伊姆法爾舟公哩之地點。同時集結於素嬉拉之第三路日軍，刻正重壓伊姆法爾，今後英印軍欲應付以上之重大事態，必須防衛伊姆法爾平原，更須確保梯迭據至馬尼布爾及達姆至丘陵地帶之兩公路。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　印度日軍某基地廿六日電：緬印方面之戰事，刻蔓延至仁巴爾平原，敵第四軍之根據地正陷於極混亂狀態中，其第廿師團方面被日印軍南北夾攻，狼狽潰退，與第廿三師團一同向假通仁巴爾之兩條公路連夜奔逃，刻自頓扎恩方面進攻之日印軍，繼續沿仁巴爾公路北上，自達姆方面前進之日印軍各部隊則利用機甲部隊之迅速尾追敗敵，該方大殲減戰漸入於決戰階段。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　緬甸前綫二十六日電：頓札恩。梯迭姆附近之英軍第十七師，已瀕於潰滅狀態，加飽地區之英軍第二十師，十九日於莫列塔姆附近亦被日印軍完全包圍，而將瀕於潰滅。爰擁有戰軍火砲之日印軍於突破塔姆前衛要衝之威特庫要塞，向敵挺進於塔姆南十公里之班達扈，近陸續總攻據守陣地頑強抵抗之敵軍，此地帶將演成熾烈之戰鬥。又於天森西方突破國境錢之印國民軍及日軍某部隊，已深入印境而北進。十七日迄十九日間於莫列西約二十公里之基彭附近，扼制莫列塔姆至巴列璽途中敵之退路·渡過更的宛河之日印軍於十五日衝破密林向西南推進，十九日於莫列北二十公里民當及其北方塔南，戰斷敵軍之北方幹綫，完成對盤據於莫列塔姆之敵第二十誦之包圍網，現正竭力壓縮，敵第二十師之命運將與其第十七師同，其全被殲滅祇為時間問題。</p>
<h3>日東西兩部軍　司令官易人　防衛日本土陣容加强</h3>
<p>東京廿五日中央社電　日陸軍省二十五日發表：任命藤江專輔大將爲東部軍司令官，任命下村定中將爲西部軍司令官，任命參謀次長泰彥三郎兼任陸軍大學校校長，任命七田一郎爲陸軍科學學校校長。此次實行異動後，土肥原東部軍司令官及飯村陸大校長，均轉任某要職。日陸軍當局有監於現下大東亞戰局之重大性，更送肩負防衛日本土重責之東西兩部司令官，因而陣容　形堅强極堪注目。</p>
<h3>兩司令略歷</h3>
<p>藤江大將　大正三年畢業於陸大，曾任參謀本部部員。駐法大使館附武官輔佐官，和平條約　　　　，日內瓦一　軍　會議全　委員隨員等要職職，為　軍有　之歐洲通，於中國事　勃發未發，復以第一綫兵團長之職，參加徐州會　及武漢攻略戰。十四年任　大校長，十六年任四部軍司令官，十八年二月　　大將。</p>
<p>下村中將　大正五年畢業於陸大，曾任參謀本部部員。駐法和平條約實施委員。日內瓦一般軍縮會議全權委員，與藤江大將為陸軍部內之精曉歐洲事情者。於東京灣要　司令官在任當時進級爲中將、後復任陸軍砲工學校校長。陸大校長等要議。十七年十一月任在華兵團長，指揮浙贛作戰時，曾被稱為二正面包圍戰法而大吿成功，使渝陣營一聞下村攻勢之名，即震撼莫措。在任中於　子江下淹地區之治安維持，及與國府在上海機關之連絡等軍致方面專務，均有偉大之功績。</p>
<h3>日軍砲擊　奧加斯塔灣　波島哨戒戰仍進行中</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　美南太平洋艦隊司令都發言人於二十四日宣稱：最低二日間日軍曾砲擊波島恩布勒斯員加期塔灣之美軍　頭堡壘，又該島哨戒戰鬥尚在進行中。</p>
<p>七田中將　歷任敎育　監部。步兵學校士官學樣長等要職多年，從事　軍敎育工作，故此次擔任科學學校校長，堪稱最爲適任。</p>
<h3>英美衝突的激化</h3>
<p>— 魯文</p>
<p>在東西二大戰綫上，數人英美正在企圖孤注一應的武力的總反攻，同時，並將其惡毒的政治策略的慶手，伸展到各方面，或使軸心方面能小國退出戰綫，或拉攏諸中立國加入自己陣綫，並計劇奪取軍事基地，軍需資源。這些都表示出他們不能用自信以完遂武力反攻苦悶。但「繁者溺於策」，英美亦不能免於例外，而自行　躓於自己的謀略中。兩國之間，發生了各種利害衝突，演出紛爭的　態，而蘇聯從側面對兩國所加的壓力，愈使他們焦燥，而在二者的聯合上，加深了裂痕。最近顯現的英美爭執，不總一一枚舉，玆試舉其主要者如次：</p>
<p>一。西亞的石油問題，乃　內石油資源漸感涸竭而狼狽的美國所施的狡猾手段。其發端在於計劇敷設聯結蘇地。阿拉伯的波斯灣及地中海的輸油管，此事即在美國國內亦釀成重要的問題。在英國而言，美國對於向來幾在獨占形態下的西亞石油資源，欲建築侵路的檻頭堡，表示極度憤慨，成為兩國間重大的糾紛問題</p>
<p>二。粱阿根廷法萊爾新政權政　的機會，美國所採的對阿根廷　迫政策；對蘇聯讓渡巴陀里奧艦隊間題；美國的掙足蘇芬和平問題等；　許多美國最近所施的外交策略，都從美國利己的立塲出發，獨斷獨行，不謀之於有密切的利害關係的英國，因此，英國極表不滿。</p>
<p>三。關於開闢歐洲第二戰綫問題，英美兩國在勸定供出兵力量的比率上，亦相爭甚烈。</p>
<p>四。關於戰後對策上的通貨，貿易，資源，海運，航空等各種問題，英美常主張自己的利益，而不斷爭倫。戰後對策可說完全是他們的如意算盤，兩國的戰爭目的，不出乎以制霸世界　目標。對此，二者意見不一致，即表示戰爭目的之分裂，這是英美聯合上最大的障書。在適問題上，爾國間業巳釀成不穩的空氣。</p>
<p>五。東亞方面、美國的　足印度及澳洲，成為英國不快的原因。尤其在作戰上，英印軍反攻緬甸的失敗，激發了美國的不滿‘目前正展開着激烈的勾心鬥角的　爭。</p>
<h3>美國國內反英空氣濃厚</h3>
<p>此外，如最近英國議會上對大西洋憲童的養問，及排斥殖民地的外國資本論等，反映兩國間不明郎空氣的現家，層出不窮。美國國內的反英空氣，漸趨濃厚。嬝近美國所表現的　論，以英國為此次戰爭的實任者，美國在第一次大戰及此次大戰中二次被英國拖入戰爭。而美國雖自任為協約國的兵工廠，依武器租借法援助英國及別國，但要求代價時，英國則表示異議，故斥之為忘恩之徒。木來美國的向協約國援助武器，斷不發自淸廉的精神，館時要求代價，縱對為自己同志的國家，亦慾　無饜。這一點，渝政權究竟是否明瞭？現在如再不覺　，恐將有遺恨千古的結果吧！</p>
<p>要之，英國已漸入老裂之境，其　命實繫於此次戰爭中的最後掙不是善意的同志，抱着一有機會，即欲打倒英國制霸世界的野心。這二者自始就沒有可以結合同進的關係。兩者間的予盾衝突，跟着戰同的推移，至今日益顯其　贛。</p>
<h3>印度國民軍　士氣旺盛</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　緬甸日軍前綫某基地電：自由印度國民軍參謀長鮑斯勒中於緬印戰綫指揮國民軍，進擊巳歷三月，頃　抵此間，據談稱：印國民軍此次於日緬兩國之絕大協力下，已突入印度國境，士氣刻極旺盛。當前戰局較爲嚴重，故我必須分擔日軍之一部份力量。我等爲獨立奮戰，必能獲得莫大勝利，但欲佔領德里，尚須相當時日，我等軍隊決不退却，一度佔領之土地決死守到底</p>
<h3>日全力支援印獨立鮑斯主席表示謝忱</h3>
<p>仰光廿五日中央社電　日東條首相於印國民軍攻入印境時，即復向世界闡明日政府支援印度獨立之決心。自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉飽斯氏特於廿四日發表惑謝聲明如次：印度國民軍攻入印度國內後，我人之獨立戰爭，即進入困離下階段，但我人確信上蒼庇護，必能酬答印度及東亞以至人類全體對我人之信賴。我人此後從事戰鬥外。同時對於已獲解放之印度土地，施怖新政治方針，確信此項新政治方針，即係吿訴三億入十八百萬印度人自治，與受外國支配之區別，余預科敵方於恐惶之野心，將肆意作反宣傳，此次日東條目相親筆致書與余，更堂皇向世界發表聲明，印度臨時政府及國民軍以迄印度人全體對此均表感對。印度臨時政府於三月二十一日發表印國民單已突入印境之聲明後，日東條百相即發表聲明向世界闡明信居東亞之印度人與日本間之鞏固信賴，與衷心協力情神，我等印度人亦與東條閣下同樣充分自覺，為爭取印度獨立而鬥爭，為東亞及為世界正養而作戰。</p>
<h3>議會閉幕後　日首相談話</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日東條目相二十五日於第八十四屆議會閉慕後，特發表談話，力言決致全力增強戰力，確保國民生活，向獲得最後勝利之途　進。幷熱望一憶國民總　起，勵精圖治刻苦耐勞，以充足作戰之要求送請江氏評選央定，原定第題錄取三篇，中央社特要精選定每　八篇，除前三名外，　餘兩題共得佳件十篇，由中央社編印小冊發表之，增產運動之基本間題所有文稿，則推由中央社總編輯關竹邨　至上海，上海評選委員會訂於二十七日下午五時開會，評選兩題，論文，選定後，自還都紀念日起，陸　在全國各報發表。</p>

<h3>渝方美元泛濫　物價愈昂騰</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央社電　渝方近因美元泛濫，故物價愈形馬騰，傳渝方官民之間，已釀成排美益氣，般近渝方中央日報登載一文，題為：「美元勢如洪水」，即足反映以上空氣，茲誌其大意如次：近半年來重慶市之外國機關，如大使公館，軍事代表團，或各通訊社分社之門前，屢有三五投機家出沒，彼等每遇外人輒追問有無美元，現金百元二百元均可，總之若有美元，即可獲利，去年四月海關金票於市面出現後，即與美元等價對法幣則為一與廿之比，外國匯兌，亦以此換算率為基準黃金，並無定價格，於是黑市乃大肆活躍，因此其至美軍與外交官攜來之私款，亦成為投機之對象，近數月來，黑市愈形猖獗，美金公債，自六十餘元躍至百四十餘元，美元自八十元躍至百八十元，黃金每兩則躍至二萬七千元之譜。</p>

<h3>第一警局保甲處　今日招待各界　切實聯繋推行保甲行政</h3>
<p>第一警察局保甲處，自成立以來，為時數月，對於界內保甲整理想組，不遺餘力。最近該處檢討過去保甲工作，獨未臻完善，目前本市市政一統，租界惡勢力，早已蕩滌盡淨，是以保甲自警團之編組機構等等，當亦實現統一，蓋過去區內，困租界之存在，保甲方面，未趨歸一，且所發之市民證，市民欲旅行全國各地，頗為困難，手續繁多，該處為便利市民旅行起見，特根據遵行內政部所頒辦法，並與盟邦關係當局聯絡，決定合法規定，以核發居住證。在目的上言，不但市民賴以便利，協助治安上，良非淺鮮，故是舉當為確立治安基礎。該處為便利市民領證，特訂定領證須知，加發給時辦現手續不善，則市民奔走麻煩，痛苦良深，過去類此事件，雖未發現，但不能謂為絕無。茲為促起各界密切注意，及保甲之忠誠協力，與各分局切實合作，是以區內保甲，當益義完滿，此舉佐以推行保甲行政，實為租界收回以來之新措施。如今木市行政統一、從逐步牲進入整個性，故對保甲編查辦法，採以往之長處，及遵奉內政部頒訂法令實施。此外對於自　團減免服役，在政府關心之下，及與民衆密切之合作，特予以規定辦法，惟查木市組織保甲發來，罪行之戰止，已頗具成績。過去在組織上因無規定，未得統一，西區及舊八區之組織，與當初一區前舊工部局時代迥異，在工部局名義下設立保甲委員會之機構，今後為謀與民衆之切實聯擊，當亦成立此項組織，但與過去性質不同，西區方面遵行設立之保甲委員會機構，自該處成立後，一部份已於最近改隸為下層機構基礎，整理該區保甲，其他方面並有產生自警團本部之必要，故亟盼市民協力合作，特由陳兼局長定於今日下午三時，假康樂大酒樓，茶曾招待本市各有關當局長官及各界名流，以及聯保長以上各級保甲委員，屆時名人巨擘，薈集一堂，處況定必熱烈。</p>

<h3>德蘇春季戰綫槪況</h3>
<p>續昨日第一版南部戰綫</p>
<h3>南部戰綫</h3>
<p>南部戰綫，以烏克蘭為中心，西瀕舊波蘭國境，西南接巴爾幹，在戰略上不消說，即在政治上和經濟上，也是德蘇兩軍的主要戰塲。自去年年底開始，基輔西面的紅軍第一烏克關戰綫軍，繼續發動南部大攻勢，其一部突入舊波闌境內，同時主力則向貝薩拉比亞南下，企圖遮斷尼伯河大河套內的德軍後路，但經布格河上游孟許斯坦部德的反攻而遭挫折。因此紅軍第二第三烏克蘭戰綫軍，變更戰略，而改將農伯河套內德電的前綫基地，從事個別的包圍，對尼古波里，克里伏洛格，契爾加希西方各地區進攻，激戰數旬，德軍於二月八日及二十一日，分別放棄尼古波里及克里伏洛格兩戰，但在契爾加希西方的科爾遜地區，順利突破紅軍的包圍圈，而向西方移動。</p>
<p>要之，自布格河上游起，至尼伯河河口，形成一條半圓形的戰綫，現正展開激烈的攻防戰，紅軍的反攻目的似為向烏克蘭西南部，作中間深入突破，載爲兩段，而頓河河口海爾遜地區集結的紅軍　烏克蘭戰綫第四軍，尚未出動，該處西方控制尼科拉埃夫，及敖特薩等重要海港，為將來的新戰塲。據中立關方面消息。德國及羅馬尼亞軍隊，已在尼科拉埃夫附近的布格河下游地帶集合完畢，整備應戰。</p>
<p>另一方面，自二月初旬，侵人舊波蘭東南部的羅　克，洛維諾及特維諾結合地帶的紅軍，經德軍加強反攻，大受挫折，今後不再出以攻勢，恐將加強修補延長的兵站綫。距倫倍爾格要衝僅百四十公里的紅軍，正進窺該城，入春以後，預料該方面必將展開激戰。同時克里米亞半島，德羅聯軍〇萬，依然健在，與克赤地區貝脫洛夫大將配下的紅軍相峙，依舊展開局部的戰鬥。</p>
<p>南部戰綫的複雜性，巳如上述，其大部份兩軍的陣地顯著的接近，戰鬥自然化為局部的攻防戰。德軍正在改編陣勢。最近在中北部前錢，無多活動，紅軍的中北部攻勢，是否將化為南部的陽勸作戰，不得而知。蘇聯方面，企圖在南部戰綫予德軍以致命傷，以諜奪回戰略地點不成，故而補充雄茲欽，柯奈史，馬利諸夫斯基及特爾蒲興各將指揮的四個烏克關戰綫軍的兵力與武器，再向前述目標採取攻勢，必無疑問。</p>
<p>要之，紅軍的企圖，德軍方面知之有素，乃在重點和要點集中兵力，實施伸縮性的反攻。因為蘇聯的大陸是廣漠一片，欲求防禦毫無間隙，是不可能的，既有照顧不周之處，也有不足守之處，所以總軍反攻為防，不拘泥於一地一域，而專以破碎紅軍戰力為作戰重點。故今後沿鐵路及公路各重耍地點，將展開激烈的攻防戰，一方面，包國的機動戰也將大見展開。（完）（譯目三月五日每日新聞）</p>

        <h1>1944.03.27</h1>
<h3>Total War and Public Opinion Organs</h3>
<p>Modern warfare is total war. The meaning of total war is twofold: First, in the process of total war, no matter where you are—east, west, south, or north—and no matter your age or gender, everyone will be affected by the war. Second, to strive for ultimate victory, in the process of total war, all the people must voluntarily participate in the war effort, contributing their manpower and material resources, and consolidating the nation's strength into a solid whole, only then can we defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Total war requires a wise leader and a strong government. The responsibility of the leader and the government is not to passively prevent the people from opposing, but to actively seek the support of the people in order to obtain the cooperation of the entire population. How can this be achieved? The only way is to establish public opinion organs to serve as a communication channel between the government and the people.</p>
<p>The government authorities need not worry about the people's opposition. A wise government can turn opposing citizens into sincere supporters. How to do it? Through explanation, explaining everything item by item, so that the people understand thoroughly and have no room for opposition, and the people will naturally support thoroughly. The government cannot explain to every individual, so the public opinion organs organized by the people's representatives are naturally the most convenient target. The government must let all the people know that this war is not fought for a certain party, faction, or individual, but for the present and future interests of the entire nation. The government's actions must be for the benefit of the whole people, solve the difficulties of the whole people. These cannot be empty words but must be put into practice in everything. If the government does not do this, then the government cannot prevent the opposition of the people. If the government is truly working hard for the welfare of the whole people, then the government can use the public opinion organs to explain. Except for military secrets, any event, whether political, economic, or cultural, that is truly for the people can naturally be frankly told to the people. Difficulties in implementation and obstacles encountered can be used as an opportunity to ask for the cooperation of the people to facilitate the implementation. If the government can achieve "nothing cannot be told to the people," the people will naturally "support everything."</p>
<p>When the whole nation is at war, it is inevitable that the government's demands are pressing, the people's burdens are increased, and the people's lives are difficult. The people can tell these situations to the wise government and ask the government to improve. Who to tell? Naturally, the most convenient is the public opinion organs. Some burdens cannot be reduced, some difficulties cannot be avoided, and the government can rely on the public opinion organs to explain to the people on behalf of the government. Some burdens can be reduced, some difficulties can be avoided, then the public opinion organs are the eyes and ears of the government, and the government should try to reduce and avoid them according to public opinion. The government's good intentions and good policies often cause the opposite results because of the people involved in the implementation and the methods of implementation. The government's sight and hearing cannot reach these errors in personnel and methods, but they harm the people a lot and can affect the people's psychology. If the people have the opportunity to appeal to the public opinion organs, and the people's feelings are conveyed, the government can immediately rectify and improve. Such a government, anyone is willing to obey, anyone is willing to support. Such people naturally are willing to automatically contribute any force.</p>
<p>With unity from top to bottom, and consistency inside and out, then can will be concentrated, ability be concentrated, then can defeat the enemy and achieve results, and achieve final victory. Public opinion organs are the medium to promote this, so we repeatedly bring it up, hoping to draw everyone's attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Indian Forces Advance Like a Bamboo Splitter Towards Imphal; British Forces Retreat Along the Imphal Road</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – On the Indian front, the Japanese and Indian forces have broken into Indian territory from three sides, crushing the resistance of the British and Indian 14th Army, and are advancing rapidly into India. According to a report by the Associated Press, the Japanese and Indian forces have reached a place 20 miles from Imphal and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the British and Indian forces. According to an Associated Press reporter on the 24th, the Japanese and Indian forces have cut off the road between Imphal and Tiddim since launching an offensive in the dense forest area of the Kabaw Valley and the Chin Hills. The British and Indian 14th Army is now resisting stubbornly in isolation. Japanese troops are currently advancing along the road west and south of the Loktak Lake wetlands, approaching a point 20 miles from Imphal. At the same time, a second route of Japanese troops has reached Imphal Street from Tamu, 40 miles southeast of Imphal, and is advancing northwest along Imphal Street, eliminating British resistance along the way, and has advanced to a point six miles from Imphal. At the same time, the third route of Japanese troops, gathered at Bishenpur, is putting heavy pressure on Imphal. In the future, the British and Indian forces must defend the Imphal Plain to deal with the above major situation, and must ensure the two roads from Tiddim to Manipur and from Tamu to the hilly area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base in India, 26th: The war in the Burma-India area has spread to the Imphal Plain, and the base of the enemy's Fourth Army is in a state of extreme chaos. Its 20th Division was ambushed by the Japanese and Indian armies from the north and south, and retreated in a panic, fleeing overnight with the 23rd Division along the two roads leading to Imphal. The Japanese and Indian armies attacking from the Tonzang area continue to advance north along the Imphal Road. The Japanese and Indian forces advancing from Tamu are using armored units to quickly pursue the defeated enemy. The great annihilation battle on that side is gradually entering the decisive stage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Burma Front, 26th: The British 17th Division near Tonzang and Tiddim is on the verge of collapse. The British 20th Division in the Kabaw area was also completely surrounded by the Japanese and Indian forces near Moirang on the 19th, and is about to collapse. The Japanese and Indian forces, possessing artillery, broke through the Weitkyu Fortress, a key point in the Tamu forward position, and advanced towards the enemy at Bandhuk, ten kilometers south of Tamu, and launched a continuous general offensive against the enemy forces that were stubbornly resisting in their positions. Fierce battles will be fought in this area. Also, the Indian National Army and a certain unit of the Japanese army, which broke through the border west of Tansen, have penetrated deep into India and are advancing north. From the 17th to the 19th, near Keppen, about 20 kilometers from Moreh, they blocked the enemy's retreat route from Moirang to Palel. The Japanese and Indian forces, who crossed the Manipur River, broke through the dense forest and advanced southwest on the 15th. On the 19th, they cut off the enemy's northern trunk line at Mintha, 20 kilometers north of Moirang, and Tanan to its north, completing the encirclement of the enemy's 20th Division entrenched in Moirang. They are now making every effort to compress the encirclement. The fate of the enemy's 20th Division will be the same as that of its 17th Division, and its complete annihilation is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Commanders of the Eastern and Western Armies of Japan Replaced; Defense of the Japanese Mainland Strengthened</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 25th: General Senjuro Fujiie was appointed commander of the Eastern Army, Lieutenant General Sadamu Shimomura was appointed commander of the Western Army, Lieutenant General Yasuhiko Asaka will concurrently serve as president of the Army War College, and Ichiro Shichida was appointed president of the Army Science School. After this change, General Toihara, commander of the Eastern Army, and President Iimura of the Army War College, were transferred to important positions. The Japanese Army authorities, in view of the importance of the current Greater East Asia War situation, further charged the commanders of the eastern and western armies, who shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the Japanese mainland, and their strong lineup is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of the Two Commanders</h3>
<p>General Fujiie graduated from the Army War College in 1914 and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, assistant military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in France, and staff member of the peace treaty and the Geneva Disarmament Conference. He is known as a "European expert" in the army. Before the outbreak of the China Incident, he participated in the Xuzhou Campaign and the Wuhan Campaign as the commander of a front-line army corps. In 1935, he was appointed president of the Army War College, and in 1937, he was appointed commander of the Fourth Army. In February 1939, he was promoted to general.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Shimomura graduated from the Army War College in 1916 and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters and a member of the Japanese Peace Treaty Implementation Committee in France. He was a plenipotentiary member of the Geneva General Disarmament Conference, and like General Fujiie, he was well-versed in European affairs within the Army Ministry. He was promoted to lieutenant general while serving as the commander of the Tokyo Bay Fortress, and later served as the president of the Army Artillery and Engineering School and the Army War College. In November 1942, he was appointed commander of the army corps in China. During the Chekiang-Kiangsi Campaign, he was known for his "two-sided encirclement tactics," which were highly successful and caused the Chungking camp to tremble at the name of Shimomura's offensive. During his tenure, he made great contributions to the maintenance of public order in the lower Yangtze River area and to military affairs such as liaison with the National Government in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Bombard Augusta Bay; Patrol Battles on Bougainville Continue</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – A spokesman for the U.S. South Pacific Fleet Commander announced on the 24th that Japanese forces had bombarded the U.S. beachhead in Empress Augusta Bay on Bougainville Island for at least two days, and that patrol battles on the island were still ongoing.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Shichida has served in the Education Supervision Department and as the head of the infantry school and officer candidate school for many years, engaging in military education work. Therefore, his appointment as the president of the Science School is considered the most suitable.</p>
<h3>Intensification of Anglo-American Conflict</h3>
<p>— Lu Wen</p>
<p>On the two major war fronts, the Allied powers of Britain and America are attempting an all-out military counteroffensive, while also extending their malicious political tactics in various directions, either to induce small Axis countries to withdraw from the war or to win over neutral countries to join their camp, and plotting to seize military bases and military resources. All this shows that they cannot confidently complete the military counteroffensive. But "those who are too clever are often foiled by their own schemes," and Britain and America are no exception, stumbling in their own plots. Various conflicts of interest have arisen between the two countries, leading to a state of contention. The pressure from the Soviet Union on the two countries is increasing, making them more anxious and deepening the rift in their alliance. The recent Anglo-American disputes are too numerous to mention, so I will try to list the main ones as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The oil issue in West Asia is a cunning tactic employed by the United States, which is becoming increasingly desperate as its domestic oil resources are gradually depleted. It originated in the plan to lay oil pipelines linking Soviet territory, the Persian Gulf in Arabia, and the Mediterranean Sea. This matter has also caused significant problems within the United States. As far as Britain is concerned, the United States' attempt to build a bridgehead for encroachment on the West Asian oil resources, which have long been virtually monopolized, is a source of extreme anger, and has become a major issue of contention between the two countries.</p>
<p>2.  Taking advantage of the new government in Argentina, the United States adopted a policy of coercion towards Argentina; the transfer of the Bartolomeo fleet to the Soviet Union; the United States' efforts to secure a Soviet-Finnish peace, etc.; many of the recent diplomatic strategies adopted by the United States have been based on the United States' own self-interest, acting unilaterally without consulting Britain, which has close interests at stake. Therefore, Britain has expressed extreme dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the opening of a second front in Europe, Britain and the United States are also fiercely competing over the proportion of troops to be contributed.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding various post-war issues such as currency, trade, resources, shipping, and aviation, Britain and America often assert their own interests and constantly argue. Post-war countermeasures can be said to be entirely their wishful thinking. The war aims of the two countries are nothing more than the goal of dominating the world. The disagreement on this matter indicates a split in war aims, which is the biggest obstacle to the Anglo-American alliance. On this issue, an unstable atmosphere has already been created between the two countries.</p>
<p>5.  In the East Asian theatre, the United States' attempts to appease India and Australia have become a source of displeasure for Britain. Especially in the war, the failure of the British Indian Army's counteroffensive in Burma has aroused the dissatisfaction of the United States, and a fierce competition of intrigue is currently unfolding.</p>
<h3>Strong Anti-British Sentiment in the United States</h3>
<p>In addition, such as the recent questions in the British Parliament about the Atlantic Charter, and the theory of excluding foreign capital from the colonies, etc., reflect the current state of unclear relationships between the two countries. Anti-British sentiment in the United States is gradually becoming more intense. Recent American arguments are that Britain is responsible for this war, and that the United States has been dragged into the war twice by Britain, once in World War I and once in this war. Although the United States has served as the arsenal of the Allies, aiding Britain and other countries under the Lend-Lease Act, when asking for compensation, Britain has expressed disagreement, so they are denounced as ungrateful. In the past, the United States' aid of weapons to the Allies was never motivated by pure intentions, and it always asked for compensation, and it had insatiable desires even for countries that were its comrades. Does the Chungking regime understand this? If it does not realize this now, it may have regrets for centuries to come!</p>
<p>In short, Britain is gradually entering an old and decaying state, and its fate depends on its last struggle in this war. The United States is not a well-intentioned comrade, and it harbors the ambition to overthrow Britain's dominance of the world at the first opportunity. From the beginning, these two countries had no relationship that could be united and advance together. The contradictions and conflicts between the two are becoming increasingly apparent with the progress of the war.</p>
<h3>High Morale of the Indian National Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base on the Burma front: Subhas Chandra Bose, Chief of Staff of the Free Indian National Army, has been commanding the National Army on the Burma-India front for three months. He recently arrived here and said: The Indian National Army has broken into India under the great cooperation of Japan and Burma, and its morale is extremely high. The current war situation is more serious, so we must share a part of the Japanese army's strength. We are fighting for independence and will surely win a great victory, but it will take some time to occupy Delhi. Our army will never retreat, and will defend the land once occupied to the death.</p>
<h3>Japan Fully Supports Indian Independence; Chairman Bose Expresses Gratitude</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – When the Indian National Army invaded Indian territory, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo immediately reiterated to the world the Japanese government's determination to support Indian independence. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, issued a statement of gratitude on the 24th: After the Indian National Army invaded Indian territory, our war of independence has entered a difficult stage, but we are confident that heaven will protect us and will surely reward the trust of India, East Asia, and all of humanity in us. From now on, in addition to fighting, we will also implement new political policies on the liberated Indian land. We are convinced that this new political policy is telling the 380 million Indians the difference between self-government and being dominated by foreign countries. I anticipate that the enemy will carry out counter-propaganda out of panic and ambition. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo personally wrote to me and solemnly issued a statement to the world, and the Provisional Government of India, the National Army, and all the people of India express their gratitude for this. After the Provisional Government of India issued a statement on March 21 that the Indian National Army had invaded Indian territory, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement to the world clarifying the strong trust and sincere cooperation between Indians living in East Asia and Japan. We Indians are also fully aware, like Prime Minister Tojo, of fighting for Indian independence and for the righteousness of East Asia and the world.</p>
<h3>Statement by Japanese Prime Minister After the Closing of Parliament</h3>

<h3>American Dollars Flood Chungking; Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) – Recently, because of the flooding of American dollars in Chungking, prices have continued to soar. It is said that anti-American sentiment has been brewing among officials and civilians in Chungking. Recently, an article was published in the Chungking Central Daily News, titled "American Dollars Are Like a Flood," which is sufficient to reflect the above atmosphere. The gist of it is as follows: In the past six months, in front of foreign institutions in Chongqing, such as embassies, military delegations, or branch offices of various news agencies, speculators have often appeared in groups of three or five. Whenever they encounter foreigners, they always ask if they have American dollars. They can handle cash of 100 or 200 yuan. In short, if they have American dollars, they can make a profit. After the customs gold notes appeared on the market last April, they were equivalent to American dollars, with an exchange rate of 1 to 20 against legal tender. Foreign exchange is also based on this exchange rate. Gold has no fixed price, so the black market is rampant. Therefore, even the private funds brought by American soldiers and diplomats have become the object of speculation. In recent months, the black market has become more rampant. American gold bonds have jumped from more than 60 yuan to more than 140 yuan, American dollars have jumped from 80 yuan to 180 yuan, and gold has jumped to 27,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Investigator Koichi Hori Passes Away</h3>

<h3>German Forces at Cassino Use Sprayers</h3>
<p>Zurich, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Lausanne Daily News reports from Berlin: Colonel Liedel described the battle for Cassino on the 25th: The German forces used smoke emitters to attack enemy tanks to confuse them in various battles at Cassino. These devices could fire ten shots. The American forces used phosphorus bombs and hand grenades, which were extremely difficult to treat if wounded. The American tactics were to concentrate a large number of troops in one place, using numerical superiority to defeat the few, often sending out forces eight times larger than the German forces. The anti-Axis forces have exhausted three divisions of troops in the Cassino area, so the battle of Cassino has reached its climax.</p>

<h3>Northern Bessarabia: Fierce Fighting Underway; Soviet Troops Cross the Dniester River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Hai Tong News Agency reports: On the southern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces continue to exert pressure on the German bridgehead at Nikolaev, attempting to break through there. On the Ge River, the situation has reached a stalemate after German forces repelled the Soviet advance. The most significant fighting is currently taking place in the central part of the southern front. Soviet troops have reached the Dniester River and have already crossed with a large force. There is also fighting in the Balti area in northern Bessarabia. After German and allied forces repelled the Soviet advance, the Germans launched a counter-offensive southeast from Chernovtsy. The Soviet forces in the Tiraspol and Dubăsari areas are launching flanking attacks from the south, attempting to encircle the German positions at Dubăsari. However, they are facing strong German resistance, and the outcome of this battle remains unclear. A German communiqué claims that a counter-offensive in the Brody sector inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Northwest of Kovel, Soviet tanks were forced to retreat again. Several attempts were made to launch an offensive southeast of Brest-Litovsk, attempting to break through the German lines, but without success.</p>

<h3>First Police Precinct Baojia Office: Hosting Guests from All Sectors Today; Closely Connecting to Promote Baojia Administration</h3>
<p>The Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct has been working tirelessly for several months since its establishment to reorganize the Baojia system within its jurisdiction. Recently, the office reviewed its past Baojia work and found it to be imperfect. Now that municipal administration in the city is unified and the evil forces of the concessions have been completely eradicated, the organizational structures of the Baojia self-defense groups should also be unified. Previously, the existence of the concessions hindered unification in the Baojia system. Furthermore, the citizen certificates issued made it difficult for citizens to travel throughout the country due to cumbersome procedures. To facilitate citizen travel, the office has decided, based on regulations issued by the Ministry of the Interior and in coordination with Allied authorities, to legally issue residence permits. This measure will not only benefit citizens but also greatly assist in maintaining public order, thus establishing a solid foundation for security. To facilitate citizens in obtaining permits, the office has established application guidelines. If the application procedures are not properly handled, citizens will face inconvenience and hardship. Although such incidents have not been reported in the past, they cannot be ruled out. To encourage close attention from all sectors, loyal cooperation from the Baojia, and effective collaboration with the sub-bureaus, the Baojia system within the precinct will be further improved. This measure, which supports the promotion of Baojia administration, is a new initiative since the recovery of the concessions. Now that municipal administration in the city is unified, it is gradually moving towards integration, so the Baojia organization and inspection methods will adopt past strengths and implement regulations promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, regulations have been established for exemptions from service in the self-defense groups, with government concern and close cooperation with the public. Since the organization of the Baojia in this city, it has achieved considerable success in combating crime. In the past, the organization lacked regulations and was not unified. The organization in the western district and the old eight districts differed greatly from the previous system under the old Shanghai Municipal Council. An institution called the Baojia Committee was established under the name of the Municipal Council. To foster closer ties with the public, this type of organization will also be established in the future, but it will differ in nature from the past. In the western district, part of the Baojia Committee established in accordance with the guidelines has recently been reorganized as a lower-level foundation after the office was established. Other aspects require the establishment of a self-defense group headquarters. Therefore, citizens are urged to cooperate. Director Chen has scheduled a tea reception at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant at 3 PM today to host officials from relevant authorities and prominent figures from all sectors in the city, as well as Baojia committee members of all levels above the Lianbao chief. It is expected that many notable figures will gather, and the event will be lively.</p>

The scale of the event is expected to be unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Rice Flour Within the Blockade Line: Distributed Separately</h3>
<p>Regarding the distribution of food rations within the blockade line in this city, excluding the first district, the Municipal Food Bureau has approved the 37th period of rice rations and the 31st and 32nd periods of flour rations. Each person will receive two sheng of rice at a cost of 23 yuan, and the distribution will take place from today until the end of this month.

<h3>Overview of the German-Soviet Spring Front</h3>
<p>Continued from yesterday's first page on the Southern Front.</p>
<h3>Southern Front</h3>
<p>The southern front, centered on Ukraine, borders old Poland to the west and the Balkans to the southwest. Needless to say, it is the main battleground for both the German and Soviet armies strategically, politically, and economically. Starting at the end of last year, the Red Army's 1st Ukrainian Front army west of Kiev continued to launch a large-scale southern offensive, with part of it penetrating old Polish territory. At the same time, the main force headed south towards Bessarabia, attempting to cut off the retreat of the German army within the great bend of the Dnieper River. However, it was thwarted by a German counteroffensive led by Manstein upstream of the Bug River. As a result, the Red Army's 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Front armies changed their strategy and instead focused on individually encircling the frontline bases of the German army within the Inhulets River bend, launching offensives in areas west of Nikopol, Kryvyi Rih, and Cherkasy. After several weeks of fierce fighting, the German army abandoned the battles of Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih on February 8th and 21st, respectively. However, in the Korsun area west of Cherkasy, they successfully broke through the Red Army's encirclement and moved westward.</p>
<p>In short, a semi-circular front line has formed from upstream of the Bug River to the mouth of the Dnieper River, and fierce offensives and defenses are currently underway. The Red Army's objective appears to be to make a deep breakthrough into southwestern Ukraine in two segments. The Red Army's 4th Ukrainian Front army, which is concentrated in the Kherson area at the mouth of the Don River, has not yet moved. The area west of there controls important seaports such as Nikolaev and Odessa, which will become new battlefields in the future. According to neutral sources, German and Romanian troops have completed their assembly near Nikolaev in the lower reaches of the Bug River and are preparing to meet the enemy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Red Army, which invaded the joint zone of Rovno, Lutsk and Ternopil in southeastern old Poland in early February, suffered major setbacks after the German army launched a strengthened counteroffensive. It is unlikely to launch any more offensives in the future and will probably strengthen its extended supply lines. The Red Army, which is only 140 kilometers away from the important hub of Lviv, is eyeing the city. It is expected that fierce fighting will break out in that area after spring. At the same time, 100,000 German and Romanian troops remain alive and well on the Crimean Peninsula, facing off against the Red Army under General Petrov in the Kerch region, and local battles are still ongoing.</p>
<p>The complexity of the southern front has been described above. The positions of the two armies are significantly close to each other in most areas, and the fighting has naturally turned into local offensive and defensive battles. The German army is reorganizing its formations. There has been little activity in the north-central front recently. It is unknown whether the Red Army's north-central offensive will turn into a feint to assist the southern front. The Soviet side attempted to inflict a fatal blow on the German army on the southern front in order to recapture strategic locations, but failed. Therefore, they are supplementing the strength and weaponry of the four Ukrainian Front armies commanded by Generals Malinovsky, Konev, Tolbukhin and Yeremenko, and there is no doubt that they will launch an offensive toward the aforementioned targets.</p>
<p>In short, the German army is well aware of the Red Army's intentions and is concentrating its forces on key points and implementing flexible counteroffensives. Because the Soviet continent is vast, it is impossible to achieve seamless defense. There are inevitably areas that are not adequately covered and that cannot be defended. Therefore, the German army's counteroffensive is a form of defense, not adhering to one particular place or area, but focusing on breaking up the Red Army's combat power. Therefore, fierce offensives and defenses will be launched at important locations along railways and highways in the future, and the German army's mobile warfare will also be greatly expanded.

<h3>Public Basketball Tournament: Hua Lian Defeats Ming Xing; Hua Nan Overwhelms Chen You</h3>
<p>In the public basketball tournament, eight matches took place yesterday afternoon at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. Although it rained, there was still a large crowd. In the Group A match between Hua Nan and Chen You, the local favorites, He Jingui and others from Hua Nan were present. Hua Nan took the lead in the first half with a score of 37 to 15. Chen You regrettably lost too many points in the first half and could not turn the tide, eventually losing to Hua Nan with a score of 28 to 61. In another Group A match, Hua Lian Pharmaceutical played against the newly formed Ming Xing team. Although Hua Lian had unfortunately lost to Dong Hua in the previous match, they are ultimately the Group A champions of Xiqing. They performed well yesterday and won without difficulty.

<h3>Rice Control Association Handles Regionally: Purchasing Rice, Discounting Cash, Limited to Acceptance Bills of Purchasing Merchants</h3>
<p>Since the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the purchasing rice and grain loan syndicate formed with Chinese and other banks adopted the acceptance bill system, establishing a total discount amount of 700 million yuan, it has now allocated 450 million yuan out of the total discount amount of 700 million yuan to six locations, including Wuhu, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Nanjing, Taizhou, and Yangzhou, based on local needs to facilitate the allocation of funds. Purchasing merchants in these locations can apply for discounts on acceptance bills from the branches of the Bank of China (the syndicate's representative) in these locations. The allocated amounts are: Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Suzhou: 100 million yuan each. Nanjing: 60 million yuan. Taizhou: 50 million yuan. Yangzhou: 40 million yuan. When the syndicate's representative bank accepts a purchasing merchant's discount request, it will sign a discount contract, send it to the Rice Control Committee for certification, deduct the discount interest, and pay the cash. The use of the low-interest loan is limited to the purchase of rice and grain and must not be diverted for other purposes. Those who do not comply with the terms of the loan agreement or intend to take advantage of loopholes will be deemed to have violated the purpose of the Rice Control Committee's loan and will be punished accordingly.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Hoarding Continues</h3>
<p>Market conditions in various industries remained relatively calm last week with no major changes. However, the authorities' investigation of hoarding continues to advance, and hoarders are facing serious threats. To prevent the relocation of hoarded goods for concealment, all goods transported in transit, whether they are controlled goods or not, must be inspected by checkpoint police. If a transfer permit cannot be produced, the goods will be considered illegally smuggled and the people and goods will be detained and investigated according to law. At the same time, citizens who are aware of such situations are urged to report them to the nearest police station or relevant authorities so that personnel can be dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation. If the report is found to be true, all such goods will be confiscated and forfeited to the public, and a fine will be imposed to serve as a warning and stabilize the market conditions for industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Must Join the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>More than 300 trade associations in this city have been formally approved for establishment, but only about 200 have joined the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members according to the law. The relevant authorities in this city believe that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the largest group organization for merchants. After a trade association convenes an establishment meeting, it should immediately join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as a member and should not deliberately delay. It should also prepare a list of members.</p>
