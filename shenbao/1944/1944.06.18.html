<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>－關於歐陸侵攻問題－</p>
<p>問：反軸心軍向歐陸實行侵反，己有一個多星期，請問這次作戰，對於整個世界戰局，具有何種意義？</p>
<p>答：歐陸侵攻，對於今後戰局，自有其重要的意義，不過爲明瞭起見，須一檢討其因果。記得所謂「第二戰綫」，首於一九四一年十一月六日，由蘇聯斯太林在革命二十四周年紀念演說中提出，他說蘇聯軍隊所以退却，放棄許事領土，實由於歐洲沒有對德「第二戰綫」所致。其後各方面就以「第二戰綫「爲挽回歐洲戰局的」法實一。可是由於英美和蘇聯之間的種種矛盾，經過了兩年六個月之久，始於最近實現。觀乎兩年六個月間德蘇戰局的演變和英美種種準備，這次作戰，不能不說是過去四年九個月的歐洲戰爭的總結算，也可說是歐戰的大決戰。</p>
<p>問：似乎反軸心軍方面對於道次作戰，具有破釜沈舟的決意，英美蘇三國今後的合作前途如何？</p>
<p>答：關於這一間題，還得檢討過去兩年六個月的歷史。一九四一年十一月六日斯太林呼籲開國「第二戰綫」之時，英美正抱着袖手旁觀德蘇虎　相爭的心理。何況當時英國鄧寇克之役的傷痰未癒，美國也未曾參戰呢！這年年底，德國對美宜戰，第二戰綫已由理論而至實踐階段，然而直到一九四二年五月之英蘇條約，六月之美蘇條約，纔算在附屬議定書中規定英美於一九四二年內展開歐洲「第二戰綫二。可是，這也只是一紙具文。英美只在這年的十一月間，向北非登陸，以敷衍蘇聯，而蘇聯則認爲這不是「第二戰綫」，堅求重新開闢。延至一九四三年十月，叉有英外長艾登，美國務卿赫爾二人莫斯科之行，召開三國外長會議，再行討論「第二戰綫一問題。接着，邱吉爾羅斯福二人，更於同年十一月底，不遠千里的到伊朗首都德黑蘭，與斯太林會談，決定「英美蘇三國在最短期間，從東西南三方面對德作戰。」又歷時達半年之久，始有這次橫渡英法海峽對歐侵攻之舉。但據英美蘇三國會議成立一年十一個月以來三國關係的演變，很明顯的可以看出，英美之戰爭目的，只在建立　格魯撒克遜人支配時間的秩序，企圖在歐洲奠定足以牽制蘇聯勢力的基礎，絕對不是眞正與蘇聯共同作戰的「第二戰綫」。所以英美蘇三國的合作不僅不侖因此進步，相反的還侖從此逐漸展開正而的衝突。</p>
<p>問：然則從戰略上言，英美這次侵歐陸的計劃和趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：英美蘇自德黑蘭會議以後，就積極準備兵力，準備從西方南方對歐登陸侵攻。英國方面，首於四月上旬在本國南部集中登陸應用的船艦約一百萬噸，並由地中海方而陸積調運各種船舶至本國。英國方面從本年年初即有遠正軍陸續在愛爾蘭及英格蘭各要港上陸，至五月間傳說抵英美加兵力總數共達三十個師團之多，由陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾，聯合艦隊司令長官金上將及陸軍航空隊司令官阿諾爾特分別統率。大概登陸的戰略已於德黑蘭會議中大致確定，至本年五月底而一切準備亦次第完成，各方面早於五月下句宜傳反軸心軍即將登陸。不過因爲天氣惡劣，始延至六月六日－恰好是鄧寇克敗退的四週年紀念日，正式發動侵攻。反軸心軍這次作戰所使用的總兵力，估計有蒙高茂萊之三十師，和尚在英國待命出發的美軍約二十師，共約一百萬左右·其兵力之多，從英美本國的總兵力及總戰力來看，也可說是「孤注一擲」了·從這裹，我們可以得到兩個結論：第一，英美此次作戰籌思甚久，所以北法乃至共他地區登陸之後，當不致如狄埃普登陸時之一擊即敗，大約眞正的決戰，要在英美軍相當深人獲得立足點以後方才展開。第二，英美這次以百萬軍隊，遠離木國，勞師遠征，曝露於以逸待勞等候己久的德國新銳戰力之前，無論從天時，地利或人和來說，終究是最大的冒險，一旦作戰不利，則從此再沒有恢復的可能了。</p>
<p>問：德國「以逸待勞」，誠然先得兵法之利，然而何以說德國有必勝的可能呢？</p>
<p>答：德國對於所謂「第二戰綫」，一直加以嚴密的注意，這是衆所共知的。特別自反軸心國德黑蘭會議以來，德方鑒於西歐的新局勢及其可能的發展，早作必要的準備。所以自一九四三－四四年間的冬季作戰以來，德國巳在東綫完全改變戰略，極力收縮戰綫，不惜相繼退出基輔·敖迪薩·刻赤·塞伐斯托波爾等重要戰略據點，使東西兩綫的戰力合理化與平衡化。同時展開對反軸心國及歐洲其他各國的政治攻勢，以爲未來決戰的準備。此外，前年北非之戰，德國幾無絲毫損失，即去年西西里島登陸以來的義大利戰事中，也始終未曾運用重兵。所以德國的實力，在這兩年間只有日趨增强。誠如本月十一日東京朝日新聞社淪所指出：「東綫撤退，德軍損失極微，蘇軍亦如此承認，可見德軍之目的，在節省兵力，其行動有非常童義。義大利戰綫亦復如此，雖遭英美之新攻勢，亦不增援，依照計劃，自羅馬撤退。」德方既有長時期的充分準備，則對於反軸心國道次侵攻歟陸，可說早在意料之中，靜待其自投羅網。過去德國在北非及義大利，不得地利，衆寡懸殊，所以不克盡展所長。但今日德國則處於內綫作戰，既佔有利地位，又有雄厚兵力，僅法比荷蘭方面，即有倫西台德元帥指揮下的六十師團，而羅美爾將軍等指揮下的尚不在內。但更共值得注意的是在人和方面，德國今日作戰，是名符其實的保衛德國與歐洲之戰，因此，德國國民雖在極大困難之下，亦毫不頹唐，毫不慌張，以十分冷靜十分沉着，應付東西兩面展開的大戰·反之，英美方面，雖以「解放歐洲」爲口號，而觀乎第一綫飛機一萬餘架之瘋狂轟炸，登陸部隊之「超理想」的殘殺，其對於歐洲諸國人民的實際痛苦，決非標語口號所能掩飾。</p>
<p>問：最後，請問歐洲侵攻作戰對東亞尤其是對重慶的命運有何影響？</p>
<p>答：世界戰爭是整個的，歐洲反英美之戰與大東亞戰爭是同一戰爭的兩面，當然有極密切的關係。日本每日新聞更於九日以「携手擊滅敵人」爲題，指出日本在束亞作戰對於歐洲反英美戰爭的重要意義，激昂東西軸心國國民崛起應戰擊減敵人的決心。我們在這裹不能不注意的有兩點：第一，向依英美爲泰山的重慶政權，始終對第二戰綫表示不滿，主張「先亞後歐」，特別是從去冬羅邱蔣開羅會談以來，更誇張宜傳英美決心首先展開對日總攻，再行解決歐洲戰事。可是現在事實證明重慶這種妄想已成夢想。今日尚有後悔不及之痛，而英美之謀略欺瞞，則更使重慶方面爲之怨恨不已。第二，英美爲着繼續利用重慶，爲其將來企圖支配東亞的根據地，必然不惜分出一部分兵力，尤共是空軍，對東亞展開擾亂性的游擊戰爭。我們必須明瞭英美這種狡詐的心理，不受任何流言蜜語之欺。我們相信，決戰的日子已迫於眉睫，亞歐兩方面共同擊減英美解放亞洲的日子也不會太遠了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日佔領馬比克諾密林英軍陷苦境巴列爾前方敵已開始後退 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電　巴列爾前方之敵，終於十日前後開始向巴列爾退却，巴列爾東方十公里馬比克諾之敵，亦向巴列爾退去，巴列爾東方二十公里，西頓吉奧之敵軍第三十三旅團，已績向巴列爾·伊姆法公路上退去，日軍佔領古迭庫諾後，繼續前進，十二日已佔領馬比克諾·另一隊進抵隆巴姆及來斯特爾中間，同時，印度國民軍亦由本道西北南三面一憲進攻，十日巳先後進抵昆焦爾（巴列爾東南十入公里），密教（巴列爾東南十三公里），楊沖（丹克諾巴爾北方八公里）。巴列爾方面，敵軍主力第二十師團，已將一部兵力轉用他方，僅據守巴列爾及其前方主要陣地，薩巴姆附近之輪型堡壘試行防禦。</p>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電　日·印同盟軍在雨季放睛後，即猛攻據守琴丘陵南一帶峻險山岳陣地之英印軍，日軍曾得此山岳地帶，居民爲予以全面協力，戰略態勢益行加强。此等各族人口，占馬尼布爾土侯國全人口之四分之一，素以强悍著稱，英國於此次印緬國境作戰開始前，會金圖懷柔此等山地居民，除以特務工作隊驅使各該民族外，更以鴉片麻　彼等强硬之反英氣氛，然終未能使彼等屈服。此次日·印兩軍之急速進擊，已將該地一帶之英印軍勢力完全驅逐，於是彼等乃欣然聲明協力日軍，彼等或爲日印軍引路，或担任運輸軍糧彈變等工作。又如單施十九村落，曾共同合議獻金一千　比，充作軍用機獻納資金，此事一經傳出，則其他各村亦皆爭先恐後，齊行獻金，其中甚有熱血靑年，希望交與彼等武器，用於殺敵。由於彼等之熱誠協力日印軍作戰，故英軍於山岳地帶之密林作戰，已漸陷於境苦。</p>
<h3 id="c3">空襲北九州美機　擊墜福岡郊外　美承認日駕駛技術優秀 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　十六日拂曉，敵機來業北九州時，其中七架爲日防空部隊擊落，十七日東京各報，均刋載由福岡電送擊落之敵機綫體及起火中之照片，敵機墜落地點，係於福岡郊外森林地帶，其機體業已破壞，備殘存B24型機機身及一部尾翼，並有美空軍旗幟，甚爲鮮明。燃燒時，並延及附近樹木。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　據福岡電，敵機十六日空襲北九州時，日太防空陣早即發覺，當即出動，於敵抵達前之數十分鐘，各地防空體制，已完全整備終了，故彼此相較，敵機損失極鉅，日方損害不足道，敵軍之誇大宣傳，完全無效。蓋因燈火管制異常完備，敵機轟炸極感困難，因之敵機竟向福岡縣之山間一農宅投下兩彈，由此可見其盲炸之一斑。按該農宅十五日下午曾在院內燒燬麥克，因餘燼未熄，至夜復燃，料敵機規之誤爲都市所致。北九州一帶住民因此次敵襲，己益加自信，記爲防空體制宏偉，故敵機空襲已不足懼。</p>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　據美聯社電，美第二十航空隊發表，十六日轟炸日北九州時，B29型機曾受大損害，致遭慘敗，其大意如次：往炸北九州之第二十航空隊，B29型機爲初次作戰，喪失之四架，可謂出師不利，四機中內二機因發生障礙，被迫降落，另一架目下行踪不明，餘一架則於北九州上空爲日軍地上砲火擊落。又此次空襲，美空軍未曾擊落日機一架，可見日機駕駛技術優秀之一斑，我人亟應急起直追。</p>
<h3 id="c4">京市米麥來源暢旺 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　京郊小麥新毅登塲之後，市區來源日見增加，現時中華門外每日到貨約達二千祖左右，售價亦告平穩，每石售價一千另五元之譜。又食米自准許自由買賣後，來源亦見好轉，據悉本月上半月間計到食米約一萬六七千担，平均美日約一千餘石，售價仍停滯於四千元上下。</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　京市民食頓告好轉，市當局徵得米統會同意，準京市米商此月起，可採辦食米二萬石，運京接濟民食。</p>
<h3 id="c5">湖南日軍節節進展對長沙作雙重包圍 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電　日軍精銳部隊，刻正冒酷暑沿湖北湖南山地，追擊渝第九戰區軍隊，到處擊破淪軍，當即於五月二十入日攻下新編第十三師，第二十九軍司令部所在地麥布。（通城東南方二十八公里）繼於三十一日攻陷淪第二十軍據點長壽街（平江東方二十公里）渝軍要衝已相繼被日軍攻佔。加以日軍進展之精速。淪軍深爲狼狽，乃抽調新編十五師救援欲據守麥埠山險實，以阻止日軍之進攻。但渝軍第一綫守備隊己遭日軍擊潰，不支敗走，日軍則繼續進攻，突破麥埠山脈之要害，到處擊破淪第七十二軍及二十軍。</p>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電　此次潮南作戰，渝重不即與日軍作正面衝突，當日猛攻時，念將第一綫隊伍撤退，而謀繞至日軍側或後方，作奇襲攻擊，但日軍之正面戰綫甚寬，雖以繞過所謂薛岳戰綫之第一綫隊伍，即將入於日軍團網中。此次作戰，淪軍除有少數軍隊尚能勉强支持外，其餘一般軍隊，均較第二次長沙作戰時頹糜。渝軍爲防守第九戰區，曾由第六戰區第七十三軍，及第七十四軍之一部，前者常機作戰時曾担當第二綫防衛，刻衆集於寧鄉（益陽東南三十七公里）防衛長沙西側一帶後者，可稱第六戰區軍之中堅，刻正沿川湘公路增援念進中。又第六第九兩戰區素爲抗戰陣營之中堅戰區關係至爲重大。第六區去年經湖北作戰，湖南作戰，及常德作戰等三次大戰，受創甚鉅，指揮系統頗形紊亂，及由黃埔軍官學校五六期生所部中央軍布防，兵力三十餘師，負有直接防衛重慶之責。第九戰區爲防衛中國西南方面之壁壘，而第一綫陣地設于新牆河畔，第二綫第三綫陣地，分設于汨水。瀏陽·河畔，長沙西方五公里之岳　山，更築有最堅固之炮兵陣地，長沙亦全副武裝。渝軍之防禦方針宗深陣地，以阻止日軍進擊，因過信自己之力量，認為無後方防禦之必要，今日軍節節進逼，渝軍自信即將破碎云。</p>
<p>對渝六九戰區進攻</p>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電日軍精說部隊，呼應河南作戰，于五月二十七日，對淪第六（孫速仲）第九（薛岳）兩戰區展開擊滅作戰，已有驚人推展，渝軍極形混亂。自日軍展開作戰以來，僅二十日已佔領兩戰區之中心部渝第九戰區根據地長沙之陷落，已迫在目前。而此次作戰，爲日軍在大規模計劃下所展開者。潮南一帝日軍大部隊之進攻，足以向世界誇示其戰力之偉大，日軍爲澈底擊減渝野戰軍起見，對宜昌正面已由數處突入，甲乙徹底攻擊。對淪第九戰區方面，即將攻略其根據地，長沙劉正由正面及左右兩翼，了以包圍。並包圍防衛長沙根據地要點益陽，對長沙展開大規模雙重包圍，甲乙益陽已于六月十一日陷落，瀏傷之陷落，亦泊在目前。日軍擊減第九戰區之態勢，業已完成。</p>
<p>日軍擊落美機十架</p>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電　此次湖南作戰自開始以來，爲期雖短，但日軍之地上砲火，已曾擊落渝美機P40型機十架，擊毀一架。又日陸軍機二日於常德益陽間之道路上，發現有東進中之渝軍大隊，乃即甲乙猛烈射擊。更於益陽西南三十公里附近之河上，發現滿載兵員之渝軍用舟艇，約三十餘艘，當予以轟炸，大半被炸沉。</p>
<p>鄭州十七日中央社電　敵機編隊作空裝九州，即告潰亂。其中一架，降落河南省內鄉機塲，當爲日空軍探知，乃於十六日上午，空襲該轟塲，炸毀其滑元路，並使B29刑之敵機中彈起火，日機完成任務後，已安返基地。</p>

<p>敵軍的侵攻歐洲終於開始。等待此日已久的德國，泰然自若，迎此歐洲決戰之日，目下激戰正在塞納灣及諾曼第半島沿海岸一帶繼續進行中，時時有戰况報吿傳來。那一日，柏林是陰天，侵攻的第一報於午後零時半田無綫電發表。午後的柏林仍與平日無異。市民生活中也看不出什麼興奮之色，旣無號外，亦無特別播音，空氣意外靜肅。</p>
<p>决心破敵</p>
<p>面臨大事變的市民臉色，毋寗事浮着安堵之色。這不是常常借花獻佛的狡猾的英美為了議混某事而實行侵入作戰嗎？一般的關心在那一日已完全消散了。「今日正是德國傾國民全力奮戰的時候！」無錢電提醒國民決心，德國國民從沒有比今日更信賴精銳的本國軍。羅馬陷落之際，得悉「羅馬雖陷，決戰必可破敵」之意的元首布吿，距今甚暫，德讓政府，軍隊和國民的呼吸湊合勝利的信心日漸高昻。</p>
<p>但另一方面，自從接獲北法的最初報吿以後，陸海軍·外交·宣傳各部及其他報道機關於午前六時即開非常會議，開始活動，各有關官廳方面，以此日此時為期，汽車和人的進出甚繁，如海通社則開始辦理題為「侵略特別報道」德紅色壁報，表示其關心。</p>
<p>反軸心軍以數小時的轟炸為上陸的前提條件，認為壓制德國空軍，在法國北部海岸舖下炸彈的絨毯，即可平安登陸。又森霍華的號令一下，在軍艦和飛機護衛下的反軸心軍即渡過了暴風雨的海峽。</p>
<p>據偵察所悉，數日來在樸資茅斯。普里茅斯·不列斯陀爾·哈爾·泰晤士等地待機的反軸心上陸軍，全身特別武裝，於夜間秘密集結出動地點，等待展開上陸戰之日。而上陸作戰用的特殊戰車·突擊砲·火焰放射器及其他武器彈　食糧，也都準備舒齊。滿月為務所蔽，海上朦朧不明，雖然有暴風雨，但上陸舟艇於暴風雨後構成橋頭堡，天氣漸佳，便於運送大軍。他們似乎預料此機一失怕不會再有登陸的機會。此日恰巧是鄧扣克紀念日。他們遂在羅馬陷落未久的這天，展開了登陸戰。德軍的法國北部防衛戰，其激烈的情况，正是「一觸即炸的地獄」。關於戰况的發表，雖極愼重，但在情報雪片似飛來的五小時以後，反軸心軍仍拼死挑戰的情形，則很　然，據傳「正與德軍激戰中」。茲根據各種情報，綜合戰況如次：綜合戰況</p>
<p>着暴風雨的惡劣天氣，從五日夜半北部海岸的情形比平常兇猛，目標是稱為「火箭海岸」的大西洋沿岸各都市。鐵橋。鐵路等。英國南部和法國北部的住民祗聽得爆炸之聲不絕於耳。此時，英美飛機蔽空而來，飛越海峽，擲下大量炸彈。兇猛的空襲在最後三個鐘頭更見劇烈，集中於二百公里的塞納灣海岸綫，東方的鄧扣克和加萊也一度加以猛烈轟炸。這樣，英美軍是逐漸迫近法國北部了。</p>
<p>製造歷史的日子終於來臨。「敵軍來襲！」地上警報突作。防禦司令倫西台德元帥立即下令「邀擊」，迄今沉默着的山一般的要塞，此時一齊對出現於前面海上的敵軍猛烈轟擊。塞納灣被哈佛，克思，瑟堡及其他方面則出的死之猛火與德國防衞艦艇的砲火所包裹，蜂擁而來的無數上陸舟艇，在這世紀的地獄中，一雙一隻被擊沉被粉碎。</p>
<p>掩護上陸軍的英美聯合艦隊羣集於塞納河河口到哈佛附近的海上，開炮猛轟，在塞納灣有大型軍艦六隻驅逐艦　十隻浴於德軍要塞砲的猛烈炮火中。如預料一般，英美的降落傘部隊和空輸部隊漏過了德國戰鬥機的防禦網，　入要塞的後方。其目的在由前後兩面挾擊要塞，並佔領德軍飛行塲。時間是一點半。在照明彈的照耀下，像水母一般落下來的傘兵，成為地上德軍瞄準射擊的　配。從天空降下的空中敢死隊，據說全部共有四師之衆，但據兩點鐘的德方報道，他們有些懸在羅美爾將軍的防空網上，有些則被包圍殲亞，幾乎全軍覆沒。此時，英美軍並在各地投下極似傘兵的人形炸彈。但他們的上陸祗在塞納，奧爾姆，維爾三河河口，哈佛的西南地區，瑟堡及其他地方局部或功。目下在第一回上陸時構成的橋頭堡周圍正在進行激戰。德方德作戰上不動則已，一動必擊之倒地。在攻勢最初的一小時內，英美聯軍已收到大打擊，此對今後的戰局發展當有重大影響。繼鄧扣克，加萊的空製之後，在英國的最後三師空輸部隊也將實行決死的降落吧，因而將有第二回第三回的上陸，德國對此已準備好萬全的方策。（大島特派員六日自柏林發）（譯自六月六日每日新聞）</p>

<p>上海特別市市民防空本部德務處長孫理甫氏，昨發表談話云：根據情報，本月十六日晨，有乙二四及乙二九式敵機約二十架，在盟邦日本九州方面施行空襲，盟邦以堅强之防空陣綫迎戰，結果擊落七架，繫傷三架，敵機喪失過半，遭受空戰史上稀有之重創，盟邦方面所受損害，則極為輕微，市內有數處，因被炸而發生火災，亦於二小時之短時問內，完全撲滅，一般市民余有工人二名略受經傷外，其他絕無損害。</p>
<p>此次空製規模相當鉅大，而損害則極為輕微，市民傷害亦止於最少限度。其故何在，蓋盟邦軍事方面之防空勢態，萬分穩妥，且官民一致協力防空，各鄰組防空陣，以健旺之士氣與整齊之秩序，作防火與待避之活動，始獲此優良之效果，苟非平時積極準備加緊訓練，曷克臻此。</p>
<p>上海方面，最近屢屢發出警戒警報與空製警報，敵機不時前來本埠上空窺察，空裝之舉，遲早必至，然就盟邦北九州之例而踐，本埠如能平素從事準備與訓練，努力不懈，則空製雖來，亦何患之有。</p>

<p>華中棉產改進會爲創立五週年紀念，昨（十七）日下午三時在外灘興亞大樓舉行茶會，招待各界，首由主席船津辰一郞致開會詞，常務理事小林氏報吿本會創立五年以來之經過，旋由實業部陳部長君　代表陳燕山氏授予該會有功人員船津辰一郎山感謝狀幷致訓詞，繼由棉花統制委員會主人委員開　亭氏致祝詞，直至五時許始散會。昨計到實業部陳部長君　代表陳燕山棉花增產協識總會　會長兼棉統會主任委員聞　亭，財政部專員李徵，棉統副主任委員童侶靑，市經濟局代表仲孫源，及日本棉花栽培協會顧問船津辰一郎，全國經濟委員會顧問山崎昇二郎，棉花收買同業協會副理事長堤孝，在華日木紡織同業會理事小池筧等數百餘人。</p>
<p>聞蘭亭詞</p>
<p>棉產改進，原係包括產量增加，與品質改良兩者而言，自近年以來，棉產改進之原有設施頗多破壞，幸賴貴會諸先生有先見之明，努力經營，一面防止棉種之退化，一面圖謀良種之繁殖，以期華中產棉得能保持相富程度，　人實深欽佩。近年以來據稱棉田面積，頗見減少，此乃因地方秩序未復，與棉花價值蛟低之故，自非貴會單獨所能為力。棉花為華中之重要資源，不但於軍需民需上，均不可缺，且華中對外用以換取民生必需之物資者，亦以棉花及其製成品之紗布為大宗，故本年棉花之增產，實關重要，鄙人添任棉統會職司，義不容辭，擔任增產協議總會副會長之職，自維棉薄，願隨諸先生之後，誓當排除抑低棉價之各種人為原因，以期回復棉花自然應有之價格，則深信棉田面積，最短期內必能回復事變前之原狀。至於地方秩序之恢復，則有賴於政府之治理及盟邦之協助，而亦鄙人所早夕禱祝者也。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>一九四〇年夏，並不十分炎熱，所以隆夫為了用功，縱整日埋頭公寓，也不痛苦。北面不見太陽的屋子，房利既賤，且光機從無變化，眞是方便已極，但一　起一面大的審布時，就感覺到屋子太小了，甚至沒有餘地睡眠了。</p>
<p>他用五十號　布，是生來第一次用這樣大的，且在心坎中忐忑不安者，這是改變了畫畫的新方針，尚是第一次的試作。他畫了二年風景畫，但此次嘗試創作，卻是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>畫材就是老在頭腦裏轉的那個久里濱的印像。就是高雄級的重巡洋艦，像海狼一樣，衝風破浪的前進姿態。與其說是姿莫如說是幻影。他並不描畫久里濱那樣地方只是描畫海洋。打算描畫的，並不是高雄級巡洋艦之形態，而是發現這艘軍艦時的衝動－－即在這一軍艦的姿熊中，想表現出引起一生大轉變的感動。於是就把盡題定名為「軍」，而就決定開始用木炭素描了。</p>
<p>當道張畫完成的時候，公寓的窗外業已吹起秋風了。秋風的涼爽，他雖然在疲勞的身體上感覺得到，但他的精神卻無時不在畫上。同然綫條的不滿意，到處都可以碰到，但總因為完結了一個創作，心中卻有無限的高興。</p>
<p>他對於這張畫的處分，是既不想出賣，而又不想作展覽會出品的。並非先有了那樣目的而才電的，同時也沒希望有那樣價值。　定了，也不裝到賽　裏陳列起來，而只是從想從電絮上卸下來，捲起來放在一傍。否則，三塊席干的屋子，就有起臥不自由的感覺。</p>
<p>（然而，在這樣作以前，還是先讓市來先生看一下吧　）</p>
<p>的確，如不呌別人看一下，而就束之高閣，他也眞覺着可惜。但搬到洗足軍站的市來氏家去，的確是十個大問題。坐電車去，這卻是一件大的東西。最後，他就托搬塲公司送去，而自己就先走，在市來家的門前等候。</p>
<p>九月是稍徽感覺寒冷的大氣。隆夫穿於斜紋呢的制服和毛綫背心，蓬鬆的頭髮受北風玩弄着，就到池上鐵路的洗足車站。</p>
<p>「喂，牟田口君，到什麼地方去？」</p>
<p>回頭一看說話的人，原來是畫家鶴原。自從在燒雞店請吃飯以後，雖然常常見面，但從巴里堂辭職後，這卻是第一次。</p>
<p>「呵，是到市來先生家去的。」</p>
<p>「我也是到他家去的，那末一同去吧！」</p>
<p>隆夫稍徽覺着不舒服。因為那張畫，只想讓市來畫家看的。（一〇二）</p>

<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>－Regarding the Invasion of Continental Europe－</p>
<p>Q: The anti-Axis forces have been carrying out the invasion of Continental Europe for more than a week. What is the significance of this operation for the overall world war situation?</p>
<p>A: The invasion of Continental Europe has its important significance for the future war situation. However, for the sake of clarity, it is necessary to review its cause and effect. I remember that the so-called "Second Front" was first proposed by Soviet leader Stalin on November 6, 1941, in his speech commemorating the 24th anniversary of the revolution. He said that the reason why the Soviet army retreated and abandoned many territories was because there was no "Second Front" against Germany in Europe. Subsequently, all parties regarded the "Second Front" as a "magic weapon" to reverse the war situation in Europe. However, due to various contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it was only recently realized after two years and six months. Looking at the evolution of the German-Soviet war situation and the various preparations made by Britain and the United States during the two years and six months, this operation cannot but be said to be the final reckoning of the European war in the past four years and nine months, and it can also be said to be the decisive battle of the European war.</p>
<p>Q: It seems that the anti-Axis forces are determined to succeed in this operation. What is the future of cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>A: Regarding this question, we still have to review the history of the past two years and six months. When Stalin called for the opening of a "Second Front" on November 6, 1941, Britain and the United States were adopting a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would fight each other. Moreover, Britain had not yet recovered from the wounds of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the United States had not yet entered the war! At the end of that year, Germany declared war on the United States, and the Second Front had moved from theory to the practical stage. However, it was not until the Anglo-Soviet Treaty in May 1942 and the US-Soviet Treaty in June that the establishment of a European "Second Front" by Britain and the United States in 1942 was stipulated in the supplementary protocols. However, this was just a paper agreement. Britain and the United States only landed in North Africa in November of that year to appease the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union believed that this was not the "Second Front" and insisted on reopening it. It was delayed until October 1943, when British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull traveled to Moscow to convene a three-nation foreign ministers' conference to discuss the "Second Front" issue again. Subsequently, Churchill and Roosevelt traveled thousands of miles to Tehran, the capital of Iran, at the end of November of the same year, to meet with Stalin and decided that "the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union would fight against Germany from the east, west, and south in the shortest possible time." It took another half a year before this invasion of Europe across the English Channel took place. However, according to the evolution of the relations between the three countries since the establishment of the three-nation conference one year and eleven months ago, it can be clearly seen that the war aim of Britain and the United States is only to establish an order in which Anglo-Saxons dominate time and to lay a foundation in Europe that is sufficient to contain the power of the Soviet Union. It is definitely not a "Second Front" that truly fights together with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not only not improve as a result, but will instead gradually unfold into a formal conflict.</p>
<p>Q: Then, from a strategic point of view, what are the plans and trends of this Anglo-American invasion of Europe?</p>
<p>A: Since the Tehran Conference, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have actively prepared their forces to launch a landing invasion of Europe from the west and south. On the British side, at the beginning of April, about one million tons of ships for landing operations were concentrated in the south of the country, and various ships were transferred from the Mediterranean to the country. From the beginning of this year, British troops have been continuously landing in various key ports in Ireland and England. By May, it was rumored that the total number of British, American, and Canadian troops in Britain reached as many as thirty divisions, led by Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Joint Fleet Commander Admiral King, and Army Air Force Commander Arnold, respectively. It is believed that the landing strategy was roughly determined at the Tehran Conference, and by the end of May of this year, all preparations were gradually completed. All parties had already declared in late May that the anti-Axis forces would soon land. However, due to bad weather, it was delayed until June 6 - exactly the fourth anniversary of the Dunkirk retreat - to officially launch the invasion. The total force used by the anti-Axis forces in this operation is estimated to be about one million, including Montgomery's thirty divisions and about twenty divisions of American troops still waiting to depart in Britain. Judging from the total force and total combat power of Britain and the United States themselves, this can also be said to be a "make-or-break" move. From this, we can draw two conclusions: First, Britain and the United States have been planning this operation for a long time, so after landing in northern France and even other areas, they will not be defeated in one blow as in the Dieppe raid. It is expected that the real decisive battle will only begin after the British and American troops have gained a considerable foothold. Second, Britain and the United States are sending a million troops far away from their countries on a long expedition, exposing themselves to the new elite combat power of Germany, which has been waiting for them in ease. Whether in terms of timing, location, or morale, it is ultimately the greatest risk. Once the operation is unfavorable, there will be no possibility of recovery from then on.</p>
<p>Q: Germany's "waiting in ease" certainly has the advantage of military strategy, but why can it be said that Germany has a certain chance of winning?</p>
<p>A: It is well known that Germany has been paying close attention to the so-called "Second Front." In particular, since the anti-Axis Tehran Conference, Germany has made the necessary preparations in view of the new situation in Western Europe and its possible developments. Therefore, since the winter operations of 1943-44, Germany has completely changed its strategy on the Eastern Front, making every effort to shrink the front line and successively withdrawing from important strategic strongholds such as Kiev, Odessa, Kerch, and Sevastopol, so as to rationalize and balance the combat power of the eastern and western lines. At the same time, it launched a political offensive against the anti-Axis countries and other countries in Europe to prepare for the future decisive battle. In addition, in the North African war the year before last, Germany suffered almost no losses. Even in the Italian war since the landing on Sicily last year, it has never used heavy troops. Therefore, Germany's strength has only been increasing in these two years. As the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun pointed out on the 11th of this month: "The German army suffered very few losses in the retreat on the Eastern Front. The Soviet army also admits this, which shows that the purpose of the German army is to save troops, and its actions are of extraordinary significance. The same is true of the Italian front. Even if it is attacked by the new offensives of Britain and the United States, it will not send reinforcements and will withdraw from Rome according to plan." Since Germany has been preparing for a long time, it can be said that the anti-Axis invasion of Europe was expected long ago, waiting for them to throw themselves into the net. In the past, Germany was at a disadvantage in terms of terrain and had a disparity in numbers in North Africa and Italy, so it could not fully display its strengths. But today, Germany is in an advantageous position in inland operations, and it has a strong military force. In the France, Belgium and Netherlands region alone, there are sixty divisions under the command of Marshal von Rundstedt, not including those under the command of General Rommel and others. But even more noteworthy is the morale aspect. Germany today is fighting a real war to defend Germany and Europe. Therefore, although the German people are in great difficulty, they are not decadent or flustered at all, and they are calmly and composedly dealing with the great war unfolding on both the east and west sides. On the other hand, although Britain and the United States use "liberating Europe" as their slogan, looking at the crazy bombing of more than 10,000 first-line aircraft and the "ultra-ideal" killing of the landing troops, the actual pain of the people of European countries is definitely not something that slogans can cover up.</p>
<p>Q: Finally, what impact will the European invasion operation have on the fate of East Asia, especially Chongqing?</p>
<p>A: The world war is a whole. The anti-British and anti-American war in Europe and the Greater East Asia War are two sides of the same war, and of course they have a very close relationship. The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun also published an article entitled "Joining Hands to Destroy the Enemy" on the 9th, pointing out the importance of Japan's operations in East Asia to the anti-British and anti-American war in Europe, and arousing the determination of the people of the Eastern and Western Axis countries to rise up and fight to eliminate the enemy. We cannot but pay attention to two points here: First, the Chongqing regime, which has always relied on Britain and the United States as its mainstay, has always expressed dissatisfaction with the Second Front and advocated "Asia first, Europe second," especially since the Cairo Conference between Roosevelt, Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek last winter, it has exaggeratedly promoted that Britain and the United States are determined to launch a general offensive against Japan first, and then resolve the European war. But now the facts prove that Chongqing's wishful thinking has become a dream. Today, there is a pain of being too late to regret, and the British and American strategy of deception has made Chongqing resentful. Second, in order to continue to use Chongqing as a base for its future attempts to dominate East Asia, Britain and the United States will inevitably spare a part of their military force, especially the air force, to launch disruptive guerrilla warfare in East Asia. We must understand this cunning psychology of Britain and the United States and not be deceived by any rumors or sweet words. We believe that the day of the decisive battle is imminent, and the day when Asia and Europe will jointly eliminate Britain and the United States and liberate Asia is not too far away.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Occupy Mabiknuomi Forest, British Troops Fall into Difficult Situation, Enemy Has Begun to Retreat in Front of Barreel <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th: The enemy in front of Barreel finally began to retreat towards Barreel around the 10th of this month. The enemy in Mabiknuomi, ten kilometers east of Barreel, also retreated towards Barreel. The 33rd Brigade of the enemy army in Sidongjiao, twenty kilometers east of Barreel, has retreated towards the Barreel-Imphal highway. After the Japanese army occupied Gutiekunu, it continued to advance and occupied Mabiknuomi on the 12th. Another unit advanced to the middle of Longbaum and Leicester. At the same time, the Indian National Army also launched an offensive from the northwest, south, and three sides of this road. On the 10th, it successively advanced to Kunjiao (ten kilometers southeast of Barreel), Mijiao (thirteen kilometers southeast of Barreel), and Yangchong (eight kilometers north of Danknopal). On the Barreel side, the main force of the enemy army, the 20th Division, has transferred part of its troops to other places, only guarding Barreel and its main forward positions, and trying to defend the wheel-shaped fortress near Sabam.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th: After the rainy season cleared up, the Japanese and Indian allied forces launched a fierce attack on the British and Indian troops who were guarding the steep mountainous positions in the southern part of the Chin Hills. The Japanese army was able to obtain full cooperation from the residents of this mountainous area, which further strengthened the strategic situation. These ethnic groups account for a quarter of the total population of the Manipur princely state and are known for their strength. Before the start of the war on the Indian-Myanmar border, Britain tried to appease these mountain residents, in addition to using special task forces to drive these ethnic groups, they also used opium and hemp to weaken their strong anti-British atmosphere, but they still failed to subdue them. This time, the rapid attack of the Japanese and Indian armies has completely driven out the British and Indian forces in the area, so they gladly declared their cooperation with the Japanese army. They either guide the Japanese and Indian armies or take on the task of transporting military food and ammunition. For example, nineteen villages in Danshi jointly agreed to donate one thousand rupees as funds for military aircraft. Once this matter was spread, other villages also rushed to donate money. Among them, there were many enthusiastic young people who hoped to be given weapons to kill the enemy. Due to their enthusiastic cooperation with the Japanese and Indian armies, the British army has gradually fallen into a difficult situation in the jungle warfare in the mountainous area.</p>
<h3 id="e3">US Aircraft Raids Northern Kyushu, Shot Down Outside Fukuoka, US Admits Japanese Piloting Skills Are Excellent <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: When enemy aircraft came to raid northern Kyushu at dawn on the 16th, seven of them were shot down by the Japanese air defense forces. On the 17th, all Tokyo newspapers published photos sent from Fukuoka of the wreckage of the downed enemy aircraft and the fire. The crash site of the enemy aircraft was in a forest area outside Fukuoka. The fuselage of the destroyed B24 aircraft and part of the tail were preserved, and the US Air Force flag was very clear. When burning, it also spread to nearby trees.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: According to a Fukuoka report, when enemy aircraft raided northern Kyushu on the 16th, the Japanese air defense force discovered it early and dispatched troops immediately. Several tens of minutes before the enemy arrived, the air defense system in various places had been completely prepared. Therefore, in comparison, the enemy aircraft suffered huge losses, and the Japanese side's damage was negligible. The enemy's exaggerated propaganda is completely ineffective. Because the lights were strictly controlled, it was extremely difficult for the enemy aircraft to bomb. As a result, the enemy aircraft dropped two bombs on a farmer's house in the mountains of Fukuoka Prefecture, which shows the extent of their blind bombing. According to reports, the farmer's house burned wheat in the yard on the afternoon of the 15th. Because the embers were not extinguished, it rekindled at night, and it was expected that the enemy aircraft mistakenly thought it was a city. The residents of the northern Kyushu area have become more confident because of this enemy attack. They remember that because the air defense system is magnificent, the enemy's air raid is not to be feared.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: According to an Associated Press report, the US 20th Air Force announced that when bombing northern Kyushu, Japan, on the 16th, the B29 aircraft suffered heavy damage, resulting in a disastrous defeat. The general idea is as follows: The B29 aircraft of the 20th Air Force that bombed northern Kyushu was the first operation, and the loss of four aircraft can be said to be an unfavorable start. Among the four aircraft, two were forced to land due to obstacles, the whereabouts of another are currently unknown, and the other was shot down by Japanese ground fire in the sky over northern Kyushu. Also, in this air raid, the US Air Force did not shoot down a single Japanese aircraft, which shows the excellence of Japanese aircraft piloting skills. We should urgently catch up.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Rice and Wheat Supply in Kyoto is Abundant <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: After the new wheat in the suburbs of Kyoto was put on the market, the supply in the urban area has increased day by day. At present, about 2,000 dan of goods arrive outside Zhonghua Gate every day, and the selling price has also stabilized, with a selling price of 1,005 yuan per shi. Also, since free trading of rice was allowed, the supply has also improved. It is reported that about 16,000 to 7,000 dan of rice arrived in the first half of this month, with an average of more than 1,000 shi per day, and the selling price is still stagnant at around 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The food situation in Kyoto has improved significantly. The municipal authorities have obtained the consent of the Rice Control Association to allow Kyoto rice merchants to purchase 20,000 shi of rice from this month to transport to Kyoto to supply the people's food.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Army in Hunan Makes Steady Progress, Double Encirclement of Changsha <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The elite troops of the Japanese army are currently braving the sweltering heat to pursue the troops of the Chongqing 9th War Zone in the mountainous areas of Hubei and Hunan, and they are defeating the Chongqing army everywhere. On May 22, they captured Maibu, the location of the headquarters of the newly compiled 13th Division and 29th Army Commander (28 kilometers southeast of Tongcheng). Subsequently, on the 31st, they captured Changshou Street (20 kilometers east of Pingjiang), a stronghold of the Chongqing 20th Army. The key points of the Chongqing army have been successively occupied by the Japanese army. In addition, the Japanese army is making rapid progress. The Chongqing army is deeply embarrassed and has transferred the newly compiled 15th Division to rescue and attempt to occupy the dangerous mountains of Maibu to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. However, the first-line defense team of the Chongqing army has been defeated by the Japanese army and fled in defeat. The Japanese army continued to advance, breaking through the key points of the Maibu Mountains and defeating the Chongqing 72nd Army and 20th Army everywhere.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: In this Hunan operation, the Chongqing army did not directly confront the Japanese army. When the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on that day, it immediately withdrew the first-line troops and planned to bypass the Japanese army's side or rear to launch a surprise attack. However, the front line of the Japanese army was very wide. Even if the troops bypassed the so-called Xue Yue front line, they would be trapped in the Japanese army's encirclement. In this operation, except for a small number of troops that can barely support, the rest of the troops are more decadent than during the Second Changsha Operation. In order to defend the 9th War Zone, the Chongqing army had transferred the 73rd Army and part of the 74th Army from the 6th War Zone. The former was in charge of the second-line defense during the Changde operation and is now gathered in Ningxiang (37 kilometers southeast of Yiyang) to defend the area west of Changsha. The latter can be called the backbone of the 6th War Zone army and is currently reinforcing the Chongqing army along the Chuanxiang Highway. Also, the 6th and 9th War Zones have always been the mainstay war zones of the anti-Japanese camp, and the relationship is very important. The 6th War Zone suffered heavy losses in the three major battles in Hubei, Hunan, and Changde last year, and the command system was quite chaotic. The Central Army, composed of graduates from the 5th and 6th terms of the Whampoa Military Academy, is stationed with more than 30 divisions and is directly responsible for defending Chongqing. The 9th War Zone is the barrier for defending the southwest of China, and the first-line positions are located on the Xinqiang River. The second and third-line positions are located on the banks of the Mishui and Liuyang Rivers. The Yue Lu Mountain, five kilometers west of Changsha, also has the most solid artillery positions, and Changsha is also fully armed. The Chongqing army's defense policy is based on deep positions to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Because they overconfident in their own strength and believed that there was no need for rear defense, the Japanese army is now pressing on step by step, and the Chongqing army's confidence is about to be shattered.</p>
<p>Offensive Against Chongqing's 6th and 9th War Zones</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The elite troops of the Japanese army, responding to the Henan operation, launched a devastating operation against the Chongqing 6th (Sun Lianzhong) and 9th (Xue Yue) War Zones on May 27, and have made amazing progress. The Chongqing army is in extreme chaos. Since the Japanese army launched the operation, it has occupied the central part of the two war zones in just 20 days. The fall of Changsha, the base of the Chongqing 9th War Zone, is imminent. And this operation was launched by the Japanese army under a large-scale plan. The offensive of the Japanese army's large troops in Hunan is enough to show the world the greatness of its combat power. In order to completely destroy the Chongqing field army, the Japanese army has broken into the front of Yichang from several places and launched a thorough attack on Army A and B. On the Chongqing 9th War Zone side, it is about to capture its base, Changsha. Liu Zheng is encircled from the front and both wings. In addition, Yiyang, the key point of defending the Changsha base, is encircled, and a large-scale double encirclement is launched against Changsha. Yiyang was captured on June 11, and the fall of Liuyang is also imminent. The Japanese army's posture of destroying the 9th War Zone has been completed.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Shoots Down Ten US Aircraft</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Although the Hunan operation has been short since its beginning, the Japanese army's ground fire has shot down ten Chongqing-US P40 aircraft and destroyed one. Also, the Japanese army aircraft discovered a large unit of Chongqing army advancing eastward on the road between Changde and Yiyang on the 2nd, and immediately launched a fierce attack on Army A and B. Furthermore, about thirty Chongqing army boats loaded with soldiers were discovered on the river near 30 kilometers southwest of Yiyang and were bombed, and most of them were sunk.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th: The enemy aircraft formation made a surprise attack on Kyushu, and it was defeated. One of them landed at Neixiang Airport in Henan Province. The Japanese Air Force discovered this and launched an air raid on the bombing field on the morning of the 16th, destroying its glide path and causing the enemy aircraft of B29 criminal to catch fire after being hit. After completing the mission, the Japanese aircraft returned to the base safely.</p>

The representatives of the two countries exchanged congratulatory words after signing the fourth agreement on the close economic relationship between the two countries. Then, they raised their glasses and toasted, and the ceremony ended in a friendly atmosphere. Because of the continued signing of this Manchuria-Germany economic agreement, the strength of the Axis camp has been enhanced, so its significance is extremely great.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Since May 27, when the elite Japanese army began a new operation against the Chongqing 6th and 9th War Zones, it has been advancing forward with the momentum of a broken bamboo. The Japanese army began its action on May 7. It dispersed the Chongqing vanguard in one fell swoop and forcibly crossed the Xinqiang River, the first line of defense in Changsha, at midnight on the same day, taking the south bank of the Xinqiang River. The main force of the Chongqing 20th Army, the 133rd Division, the 134th Division, and the newly compiled 10th Division, fled in droves. The Japanese army advanced rapidly to the south. On the evening of the 31st, it approached the north bank of the Huai River, the second line of defense in Chongqing, and inflicted a night attack on the Chongqing army's most elite direct 95th and 60th Divisions, and the collateral 30th and 99th Divisions, the Sichuan Army's 162nd Division, and the remnants of the 22nd Army, causing them to flee in defeat. Furthermore, it broke through the minefields along the coast and occupied important strongholds of Chongqing, such as Guiyi, Xinshi, Changle Street, Pingjiang, Changshou Street, etc., and continued to advance south. On the other hand, the troops advancing along the Xiang River broke through the unique lake and swamp area, wiped out the 99th Division of the Chongqing 99th Army, and occupied the strategic town of Xiangyin on the morning of the 6th, approaching Changsha, the base of the 9th War Zone. At present, the elite Japanese army is fiercely attacking Changsha as its target. On the one hand, the troops attacking the 6th War Zone will first encircle the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing 10th Army, which is entrenched in the area north of Dongting Lake, and inflict a thorough blow. On June 1, it carried out a surprise landing on Chishan Island. On the 5th, it captured Yuanjiang, a stronghold of the Chongqing 92nd Division. On the 10th, it began to attack Yiyang, a key point between Changsha and Changde, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat, and controlling the Chongqing army in the southern exhibition area of Dongting Lake to the death. The battle results are currently expanding. In addition, the Japanese air force shoots or bombs the Chongqing army and its boats to cover the advance of the ground troops, inflicting heavy damage on them. On the other hand, the air force is dispatched every day to bomb the bases of the US Air Force in Chongqing in southern Hunan Province, and has achieved great results. The Japanese ground troops have shot down or destroyed Chongqing-US aircraft everywhere. Today, the various units of the Japanese army are echoing each other in the air and on the ground, pressing hard in the Hunan mountains and plains and advancing courageously.</p>

<p>A special dispatch from Sentai reports that in recent months, particularly in May and June, bandit activity has been rampant in the eighth district of Taixing County. The local garrison, the Second Regiment of the Land Reclamation and Security Force, petitioned their superiors and were granted permission to select capable officer Dai Xuan-yu to lead a unit to Jianghua Township to conduct a suppression campaign. While simultaneously building fortifications, the bandit forces felt greatly threatened. Chen Zong-bao's "Jingjiang Independent Regiment," along with a portion of the "Second Regiment" and other local militia, totaling several thousand men, recently besieged our army's stronghold in Jianghua Township. Officer Dai led his subordinates in calmly resisting the attack and ultimately defeated the stubborn enemy. The leader of the "Taixing Independent Regiment," a certain Wang, was killed, and his unit suffered heavy casualties.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Nanjing, dated the 17th, states that the rationing of government-owned soil in the capital has been handled by the Nanjing District Soil Cooperative. Retailers have already begun sales. It is reported that the government soil being distributed is all top-quality Western soil (i.e., Northern soil). The selling price is in accordance with regulations set by the National Opium Suppression Bureau, at 1,595 yuan per ounce. All smokers in the city can purchase the soil from nearby retailers.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, states that German authorities announced on the 16th that German troops had destroyed the Kern sluice gate. This will likely have a significant impact on British forces at the mouth of the Orne River. Allied forces at the mouth of the Orne River previously had the fishing port of Ouistreham as a potential landing point, but this measure may prevent the British from using it for landings. Furthermore, not only the mouth of the Orne River but also the Orne River itself, from Kern to Ouistreham and to the Seine Bay, will dry up. The port of Ouistreham will no longer be usable except during high tide.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that on the 16th, two major battles occurred in the area held by American forces in Normandy. West of Sainte-Marie, a powerful American tank formation and mechanized units attacked German lines in the Audrieu-Eterville area, pushing the fighting several kilometers westward. Between the Vire River and the Vire Canal, the American Second Assault Group advanced southeast toward Carentan. Although German forces withdrew from the canal area as planned, all attempts by the Americans to break through were repelled. Active fighting has resumed on both sides of the Bayeux-Caen highway, and the fighting is still ongoing in that area. Near Caumont, German tank formations have improved their positions and retaken several important areas from the British. German troops have also solidified their positions south of Caen.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, states that German authorities announced on the 16th that German troops had withdrawn from Quineville on the Cotentin Peninsula to an area with strong defensive lines along the Sinop River.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that, according to official sources, the enemy used 60 landing craft to land south of Elba, an island off the northwest coast of Italy, at 3:00 AM this morning. Shortly thereafter, enemy aircraft carried out several air raids on the island, while simultaneous landings were made on the northern and southeastern shores of the island. Fierce fighting is now underway, especially in the struggle for the island's gun emplacements.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that on the 15th, the focal point of fighting on the Italian front was in the Lake Bolsena area and north of the lake. American forces concentrated particularly strong tank units in the area, with the aim of hindering the movement of the majority of German troops. After fierce fighting, the German rear guard withdrew to the main line of defense. On the morning of the 16th, fighting resumed in the Orvieto-Todi area, but the details are not yet known.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin states that American aircraft, under the cover of a large fighter squadron, carried out terror bombings in the Hungarian and Viennese regions. German anti-aircraft units shot down 22 planes. The German Foreign Minister also sent a telegram.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Tokyo, dated the 17th, reports that on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent an encouraging telegram to German Führer Hitler, wishing the German army strength. On the 16th, Hitler replied with a telegram of thanks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's reply to Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu was also received. The texts of the telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>The German Führer's reply telegram: I received your special telegram through Ambassador Oshima, and I am deeply moved and grateful for your kindness. The German army is fully prepared to meet the Anglo-Saxon invasion. The fierce battles will only increase the German army's determination to destroy the enemy and its confidence in victory. I am delighted by your offer of cooperation with our country to annihilate the enemy. I express my thanks and wish you good health.</p>
<p>The German Foreign Minister's reply telegram: At a time when the fighting has entered its most intense phase in recent days, the ability to achieve such success is enough to give the German army the confidence that the enemy will never be able to annihilate them. However, further fierce battles are expected, which the German army anticipates. Given the alliance between Japan and Germany, the Japanese and German armies will undoubtedly have the determination and faith to win victory on the entire battlefield and secure a common victory, which the German army is also confident of.</p>

At present, fierce fighting continues along the Seine Bay and the Normandy Peninsula coast, and battle reports are constantly arriving. That day, Berlin was overcast. The first report of the invasion was broadcast over the radio at 12:30 PM. The afternoon in Berlin was no different from any other day. There was no excitement in the lives of the citizens. There were no extra editions, no special broadcasts, and the atmosphere was surprisingly quiet.</p>
<p>Determination to Defeat the Enemy</p>
<p>The faces of the citizens facing this major event revealed a sense of relief rather than anxiety. Wasn't this just a cunning invasion operation by the British and Americans, who often use superficial gestures to achieve their goals? The general concern had completely dissipated on that day. "Today is the time for Germany to fight with all its national strength!" Wireless telegrams reminded the people of their determination. The German people have never trusted their elite national army more than today. The Führer's proclamation, conveying the message that "Even if Rome falls, we will surely defeat the enemy in the decisive battle," which was issued not long ago, has increased the confidence in victory among the German government, army, and people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, since receiving the initial reports from northern France, the army, navy, foreign affairs, propaganda departments, and other news organizations held emergency meetings and began operations at 6:00 AM. The comings and goings of cars and people were frequent, as if the day had been anticipated. The Domei News Agency began producing a red bulletin board titled "Special Invasion Report," indicating its concern.</p>
<p>The Allied forces, using hours of bombing as a precondition for landing, believed that by suppressing the German air force and laying a carpet of bombs on the northern coast of France, they could land safely. With the order of Eisenhower, the Allied forces, protected by warships and aircraft, crossed the stormy strait.</p>
<p>According to reconnaissance, the Allied landing forces, who had been waiting for several days in Portsmouth, Plymouth, Bristol, Hull, the Thames, and other places, were secretly assembled at night in full special gear, waiting for the day to launch the landing battle. Special tanks, assault guns, flamethrowers, and other weapons, ammunition, and food were also prepared. The full moon was obscured, and the sea was hazy. Although there was a storm, the landing craft formed a beachhead after the storm, and the weather gradually improved, facilitating the transportation of large forces. They seemed to anticipate that if they missed this opportunity, they might not have another chance to land. This day happened to be the anniversary of Dunkirk. Therefore, they launched the landing battle on this day, not long after the fall of Rome. The intensity of the German defense in northern France was like "a ready to explode hell." Although the announcements of the battle situation were extremely cautious, the fact that the Allied forces were still desperately challenging five hours after the intelligence reports poured in was clear. It was reported that they were "engaged in fierce fighting with the German army." Based on various reports, the overall battle situation is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Comprehensive Battle Situation</p>
<p>Due to the stormy weather, the situation on the northern coast since midnight on the 5th was more intense than usual. The targets were the Atlantic coastal cities called the "Rocket Coast." Bridges, railways, etc. The residents of southern England and northern France could only hear the sound of explosions. At this time, British and American aircraft flew over the strait, dropping a large number of bombs. The fierce air raids became even more intense in the last three hours, concentrated on the 200-kilometer Seine Bay coastline, and Dunkirk and Calais in the east were also heavily bombed. In this way, the British and American forces were gradually approaching northern France.</p>
<p>The day to make history had finally arrived. "Enemy attack!" The ground alarm sounded suddenly. Defense Commander Field Marshal Rundstedt immediately ordered an "interception." The mountain-like fortresses, which had been silent until now, simultaneously bombarded the enemy forces appearing on the sea in front of them. Seine Bay, Le Havre, Cherbourg, and other areas were engulfed in a deadly fire and the fire from German defense vessels. Countless landing craft were sunk and shattered in this hell of a century.</p>
<p>The British and American joint fleet, which was covering the landing force, gathered in the sea from the mouth of the Seine River to near Le Havre and opened fire. Six large warships and ten destroyers in Seine Bay were bathed in the intense fire of the German fortress guns. As expected, British and American paratroopers and airborne units slipped through the German fighter defenses and infiltrated the rear of the fortresses. Their aim was to attack the fortresses from both front and rear and to occupy German airfields. The time was 1:30 AM. Illuminated by flares, the paratroopers, falling like jellyfish, became perfect targets for the German ground troops. The airborne commandos descending from the sky were said to total four divisions, but according to a German report at 2:00 AM, some of them were caught in General Rommel's anti-aircraft nets, and some were surrounded and annihilated, almost completely wiped out. At this time, British and American forces also dropped human-shaped bombs that looked very similar to paratroopers in various places. But their landing was only partially successful in the Seine, Orne, and Vire river mouths, southwest of Le Havre, Cherbourg, and other places. At present, fierce fighting is taking place around the beachheads formed during the first landing. The German approach to combat is to not move unless a decisive blow can be delivered. In the first hour of the offensive, the British and American forces had already received a major blow, which will have a significant impact on the future development of the war. Following the air control of Dunkirk and Calais, the last three airborne divisions in Britain will carry out a desperate landing, and there will be a second and third landing. Germany has prepared a complete plan for this. (Special Correspondent Oshima from Berlin, June 6) (Translated from the June 6 Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, reports that German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 16th that German forces had attacked the London area with new weapons on the night of the 15th, dropping ultra-heavy bombs.</p>
<p>In addition, an official from the German Foreign Intelligence Agency stated yesterday about the new weapons used by the German army in the attack on the London area:</p>
<p>The army attacked England and the London area with new weapons on the night of the 15th. The Allied forces had previously believed that the German army's retaliatory tactics could not be realized, but this has now begun to be used in Britain.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that according to telegrams received here, the southern coast of England was engulfed in flames last night and this morning, and the light could be clearly seen from across the strait. According to sources close to communications, new German weapons continue to explode in cities in southern England and the London area. British reports say that the explosive power of the new weapons is the strongest experienced since the start of the war. Also, Reuters reported occasional interruptions last night.</p>
<p>A Night of Terror in Greater London</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin reports that according to German air force reconnaissance reports, the damage to the British mainland due to the use of new German weapons is extremely severe. The area from London to the middle of England is completely covered in black smoke. The areas from Kingsquin to Bletchley, south of London, and from Sevenoaks to Sutton are also filled with black smoke. After considerable difficulty, German reconnaissance planes photographed the area over Southampton. The results show that most of the port's ships and adjacent city streets are on fire. Due to the darkness, it was impossible to take accurate pictures. Other reports indicate that the damage to London is quite severe, with warehouses and canals along the Thames River on fire, and railways destroyed everywhere, causing chaos in the transportation system. Furthermore, according to reports from German air force pilots who returned from bombing southern England on the morning of the 16th, many transport convoys near Spithead, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, were heading southeast and appeared to have been completely sunk.</p>
<p>Range of 90 Miles</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Lisbon, dated the 17th, cites a report from Washington stating that American authorities issued the following comments on the German use of secret new weapons on the 16th: Pilotless aircraft are extremely terrifying. The primary task of this new weapon is to detect and bomb Allied forces. It is believed that its range is at least 90 miles.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Efforts to Prepare for Air Defense in the City Should Be Intensified; Talk by Chief of General Affairs, Sun, of the Air Defense Headquarters <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Sun Lifu, chief of general affairs of the Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, stated yesterday: According to intelligence, on the morning of the 16th of this month, approximately 20 enemy aircraft, types B-24 and B-29, carried out an air raid on Kyushu, Japan, an allied nation. The allied nation met the attack with a strong air defense line, resulting in the shooting down of seven aircraft and the damaging of three. The enemy aircraft lost more than half of their force and suffered rare heavy damage in the history of aerial warfare. The damage suffered by the allied nation was extremely minor. Several places within the city caught fire due to the bombing, but these were completely extinguished within a short period of two hours. Besides two workers who suffered minor injuries, there was no other damage.</p>
<p>The scale of this air raid was considerable, but the damage was extremely minor, and civilian injuries were kept to a minimum. The reason for this is that the allied nation's military air defense posture is extremely sound, and officials and civilians worked together on air defense. The neighborhood air defense teams, with their strong morale and orderly organization, engaged in fire prevention and evacuation activities, which resulted in this excellent outcome. Without active preparation and intensified training in ordinary times, how could this have been achieved?</p>
<p>Shanghai has recently issued numerous alerts and air raid warnings. Enemy aircraft frequently come to scout over the city. Air attacks are bound to come sooner or later. However, following the example of Kyushu in the allied nation, if the city can prepare and train diligently, with relentless effort, then even if an air raid comes, what is there to fear?</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to protect the lives and property of the city's five million residents, the Air Defense Headquarters hopes that the public will fully understand the importance of air defense determination and preparation and strive to engage in air defense training.</p>
<p>It seems that Chongqing is broadcasting news of the Tokyo air raid, which is a baseless lie and definitely not true.</p>

<p>In order to renew diplomatic relations between Italy and the National Government, the authorities of the Italian Embassy in Japan carefully discussed future Italian diplomatic policy in China. The new Italian Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Spinnari, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th via Fukuoka, Japan. He met with reporters and made the following statement:</p>
<p>"I have been in Tokyo for about half a month, and I am very concerned about the new Italian policy in China in the future. Today, I am coming to China as Chargé d'Affaires, and I will first go to Nanjing in the coming days, hoping to resume diplomatic relations between Italy and China. All local embassies and consulates in Shanghai will be re-established. Regarding the Tianjin consulate and other issues, decisions will be made after going north. During my time in Tokyo, I visited Chinese Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who was flying to Japan on official business. The talks with the ambassador were very pleasant. We made permanent plans for the various measures this time." Mr. Spinnari also described what happened when he suddenly encountered an enemy American air raid in Japan on the 16th while returning to Fukuoka:</p>
<p>"At 1:00 AM and 1:45 AM on the 16th, Fukuoka City issued air raid warnings twice. At that time, I immediately entered a nearby air raid shelter to take temporary refuge. At the same time, many Japanese people entered without showing any panic. This is all due to strict training in ordinary times. All sections of air defense personnel and soldiers also calmly responded with their trained experience. The attitude was extremely calm and serious. I saw that the current Japanese people are indeed forming a great nation with a brave and resolute posture."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to close at the end of last month. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance considers Shanghai to be a region with heavy financial importance. To facilitate all important financial matters, it has specially appointed Li Zheng, the former director of the Shanghai Office, as a Commissioner of the Simplified Appointment rank, to be stationed in Shanghai to handle administrative affairs.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the work in Shanghai has always been extremely busy. In order to promote departmental affairs, the Shanghai Office will be reorganized into the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai Special Municipality, with the former Director Wu Rong appointed as Commissioner. He officially took office on the 1st of this month.</p>

<p>Since the cotton cloth retailers in the city began selling household cloth rations, the general public has rushed to designated retail stores to purchase the cloth due to the high demand. However, it has now been discovered that some retailers are replacing the rationed goods with inferior goods to profit from them, so that the general public cannot obtain suitable clothing materials. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate these illegal cloth shops.</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Establishment of a Vagrant Labor Camp; Directors Have Been Appointed; Method for Soliciting Startup Funds Agreed Upon <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Since Mayor Chen and Minister Ding invited various sectors of society to hold tea parties on May 28th and June 9th to discuss the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp, preparatory work has been actively underway. A preparation office has been established at No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yuwei Road. The organizational regulations of the camp have also been approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, with Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, serving as Chairman of the Board, and Wu Songgao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, serving as Vice-Chairman of the Board. The directors from the Ministry of Welfare are Zhang Kechang, Fang Lvxing, and Yang Jingyu. The directors from the Shanghai Municipal Government are Xiong Jiandong, Sun Mingqi, Lu Ying, Su Chengde, and Du Zhengjian. The directors from the local gentry are Li Zanhou, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Tang Haian, Pan Sanxing, Xu Liqiu, and Zhou Yuying, with Zhou Yuying appointed as the preparation director. At the tea party on June 9th, Li Zanhou and Xiang Kangyuan proposed a method for the commercial and industrial associations to solicit startup funds for the camp, and the principle was enthusiastically supported. Based on the agreed principles, the "Method for Shanghai Trade Associations to Solicit Startup Funds for the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp" has been drafted. In addition to the Municipal Government ordering the Bureau of Economics to issue a notice to all trade associations and banks, money shops, factories, companies, and firms to actively donate and support the undertaking, Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, and Secretary-General Wu will separately send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bureau of Economics to assist in the fundraising efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Winter Relief Society Has Completed Its Work; Urging the Return of Donation Record Books <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee's three projects for the 32nd year—distributing porridge, clothing, and providing shelters—benefited the poor to a great extent. The funding for this winter relief effort was raised through 379 teams, with social elites and philanthropists serving as team leaders. All winter relief matters are now coming to a close. It is reported that the total donation revenue was over 12 million yuan, with expenditures of over 6.8 million yuan for relief, over 500,000 yuan for administrative expenses, and a surplus of over 4.7 million yuan. This surplus winter relief fund and all receipts and ledgers for relief expenses have been submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The remaining funds will be used to carry out winter relief this year. It is also reported that there are still 21 teams whose team leaders have not returned their donation receipt books despite repeated requests. As a result, administrative matters have not been fully completed and collection efforts continue. It is hoped that all team leaders who have not yet returned their donation receipt books will promptly submit them so that a memorial record can be compiled and distributed to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Social Welfare Department Commends the North China Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the drought in North China was widespread and caused severe disasters. Fellow villagers from various North China provinces residing in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui repeatedly petitioned Minister Ding of the Social Welfare Department, requesting relief. In addition to Minister Ding presenting a request to the Executive Yuan for an appropriation from the national treasury for relief, he later jointly convened leaders from all walks of life in this city with Mayor Chen of Shanghai to request donations from the public for relief. The leaders from all walks of life, already feeling the urgency of the situation, accepted Mayor Chen and Minister Ding's intentions and actively raised funds. The North China Emergency Relief Association was spontaneously initiated and organized by the public, with all directors serving as leaders from all walks of life. The executive directors were mutually elected as Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Cen Deguang, Lin Kanghou, Wu Qi, Wu Zhenxiu, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, Zhang Yipeng, Sheng You, Huang Jinrong, Ye Fu, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Shuyong, Yan Junren, and others, totaling nineteen people. The association, on the one hand, raised donations and, on the other hand, purchased food supplies and transported them to North China. This lasted for nine months before concluding. According to the association, under the supervision of the Social Welfare Department, it was purely led by leaders from the public who acted voluntarily. The receipt of funds was entirely entrusted to the bank, and the association itself did not receive donations. The donations received were disclosed in the newspapers daily to demonstrate strictness and honesty. The purchase of food supplies was entirely entrusted to the Commercial Control Association. The association itself did not procure them. Transportation was entirely entrusted to the Huazhong Transportation Company, and the association itself was not responsible for transportation. As for disaster relief, it was handled by the local government offices in North China, and the association itself did not participate in the implementation of policies. With such clean procedures, absolute openness, and responsible persons being just and honest, it can be said that there was no precedent. It is truly rare and valuable. The North China Emergency Relief Association filed its affairs with the Social Welfare Department on February 20th of this year. In addition to approving the filing, the Social Welfare Department expressed its commendation and sent letters of thanks to each of the association's executive directors. Furthermore, the association's accounts have been repeatedly disclosed in past newspapers. Now, a summary is published as follows:</p>
<p>Income side: A, Donations, 11,230,422.34 yuan; B, Interest, 54,468.88 yuan. Expenditure side: A, Relief grain, 5,461,849.85 yuan; B, Relief funds, 41,800,000.00 yuan; C, Bank handling fees, interest, and taxes, 2,455.91 yuan; D, Bank handling fees, 241.56 yuan; E, Funds transferred to the Shanghai Welfare Fundraising Committee, 748,795.85 yuan; F, Administrative expenses, 271,548.05 yuan, including travel expenses, freight charges, postage, and telegram fees, etc. The receipts for the above relief items have all been transferred by the Emergency Relief Association to the Shanghai accountants Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan for review.</p>

<p>Mr. Liang Zhongyao, owner of Ai Ju Ge, advocates for educational endeavors and spares no effort. In recent years, he has repeatedly supported the education assistance campaign organized by this newspaper. Recently, in light of the drastic fluctuations in general prices and the inevitable increase in tuition fees for the next semester, he is deeply concerned that outstanding students from impoverished families will find it increasingly difficult to pursue further education. Mr. Liang, a clean and honest official, "has no way to offer large sums to support education." Therefore, he donated all 250 pieces of famous calligraphy and paintings from the Qing dynasty in his collection and entrusted President Chen of this newspaper to display them on his behalf, with all proceeds going to support education. Furthermore, he limited the support specifically to impoverished students in the three disciplines of engineering, agriculture, and medicine at universities, with the intention of nurturing specialized talent and saving the nation through science. In addition to accepting this, this newspaper expresses its infinite respect for Mr. Liang's noble and righteous actions. It is now scheduled to be open to the public at the China Book Garden on Jing'an Temple Road from June 20th to 25th. As it concerns a righteous act of supporting education, we hope readers will visit and make purchases.</p>

<p>Allied Nations' Friendship - Professor Yoson is very popular. Professor Yoson has expressed his support for the education assistance work of this newspaper and the Xinwenbao. Yesterday, he specifically donated 5,000 yuan, with 2,500 yuan donated to this newspaper's education assistance fund and 2,500 yuan donated to the Xinwenbao's education assistance fund. His sincerity is commendable. Furthermore, Professor Yoson is scheduled to go to Suzhou today and will also travel to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places to give academic lectures.</p>

<p>The Central China Cotton Improvement Association held a tea party at the Xingya Building on the Bund yesterday (the 17th) at 3 PM to commemorate its fifth anniversary. The party was held to receive people from all walks of life. First, Chairman Tatsuiro Funatsu delivered the opening remarks. Executive Director Kobayashi reported on the association's progress over the past five years. Then, Minister Chen Jun of the Department of Industry, on behalf of Mr. Chen Yanshan, presented a letter of appreciation to Tatsuiro Funatsu, a meritorious person of the association, and delivered a speech. Subsequently, Mr. Wen Ting, chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech. The meeting did not end until around 5 PM. It is estimated that Minister Chen Jun of the Department of Industry representing Chen Yanshan, President of the Cotton Production Increase Coordination Association and Director of the Cotton Control Committee Wen Ting, Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance Li Zheng, Deputy Director of the Cotton Control Committee Tong Luqing, Representative of the Municipal Economic Bureau Zhongsun Yuan, Advisor of the Japanese Cotton Cultivation Association Tatsuiro Funatsu, Consultant of the National Economic Council Shojiro Yamazaki, Vice President of the Cotton Purchase Association Takashi Tsutsumi, Director of the Japanese Cotton Textile Association in China Kakei Koike, and hundreds of others attended.</p>
<p>Wen Lanting's Speech</p>
<p>Cotton improvement originally encompasses both increasing production and improving quality. Since recent years, many of the original facilities for cotton improvement have been damaged. Fortunately, gentlemen of your association have had foresight and worked hard, on one hand preventing the degradation of cotton seeds and on the other hand seeking to breed good seeds, in order to allow cotton production in Central China to maintain a fairly substantial level. I am truly deeply impressed. In recent years, it is said that the cotton field area has decreased considerably, which is due to the unsettled local order and the low value of cotton. This is not something that your association alone can do. Cotton is an important resource of Central China, indispensable not only for military and civilian needs, but also the main commodity used by Central China to exchange for essential civilian supplies is cotton and its manufactured products of yarn and cloth. Therefore, increasing cotton production this year is very important. I have taken up the position of the Cotton Control Committee, and I cannot shirk my responsibility. I also hold the position of Vice President of the Production Increase Coordination Association. I feel that my abilities are limited, but I am willing to follow the gentlemen and vow to eliminate various man-made reasons for suppressing cotton prices, in order to restore the natural and proper price of cotton. Then I deeply believe that the area of cotton fields will definitely be able to return to its pre-incident state in the shortest time. As for the restoration of local order, it depends on the government's governance and the assistance of allied nations, which is also what I pray for day and night.</p>

<p>Chung Hwa Book Company, a major cultural publishing enterprise in our country, has its business office located at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road. Unfortunately, at 2:15 AM yesterday (the 17th), a sudden fire broke out. In an instant, the flames raged and the entire building was engulfed in flames. The source of the fire originated on the third floor, which was mostly used as a warehouse, with only a small portion used as an office. All the staff of the company had left the office after 5 PM the previous evening and returned home. There was no one inside. Unexpectedly, after 2 AM yesterday morning, a major fire suddenly broke out on the third floor. At that time, the fire spread rapidly, and flames shot straight up. After the nearby Self-Defense Corps discovered the fire, they immediately reported it to the nearby fire department, which immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. However, because the fire was so fierce, even though efforts were made to rescue the fourth and fifth floors with stacked debris, it did not begin to subside until four hours later. The fire was still being extinguished at 5 PM in the afternoon. Only the business departments on the first and second floors of the building suffered water damage. The third floor and above were completely burned, resulting in heavy losses. Although the adjacent Commercial Press was not affected by the spread of the fire, it has been affected and the losses are also considerable.</p>

<p>Application Deadline is 20th Distribution</p>
<p>Since the distribution of the seventh round of application forms for the newspaper's reader-funded scholarships began, applications have been sent to more than 500 schools. Most of the applications that were opened by mail have now been approved. However, there are still a small number of schools that have not picked them up. Please send someone to pick them up in the next two days. Distribution will stop after the 20th. As for the number of applications opened by mail, it has now closed, and no more will be accepted.</p>
<p>Apologies from Schools, this time the initial review was done by the schools on behalf of the newspaper. In particular, the office had to limit the number of applicants. It was even more appreciated that some schools had to make a second selection after the first review. Special thanks to the school authorities. Also, this time, because some schools did not fill out the general information survey form first, a few schools used slightly different school names before and after, and some schools even sent duplicate letters or filled out the survey form repeatedly, which made the verification more difficult and required several trips back and forth before they could be picked up. The office is very sorry. We hope that school authorities, parents, and students will pay attention to the news in this column at any time in the future so that everything can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Academic Lecture This Morning The fourth lecture organized by the office for high school students and above is scheduled to be held this morning at 10:00 AM at Xin Zha Road Elementary School.

<h3 id="e32">Municipal Consultation Committee - Reception for Allied Nations - Secretary-General Wu Explains the Significance of the Consultation Committee <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>In order to seek effective communication and exchange opinions with all parties, the Municipal Consultation Committee previously invited journalists, municipal officials, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors. Now, at the invitation of Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government, a tea party was held at the First District Government Office on the afternoon of the 16th at 4 PM to receive leading representatives of the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai, representatives of the residential community, and journalists. Attendees included Secretary-General Wu Songgao of the Municipal Government, standing committee members of the Municipal Consultation Committee Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Siliang, Chen Binsu, and Japanese guests including Residential Community President Nobuo Watanabe, Residential Community Chairman of the Assembly Genkichi Yasui, President of the Dairiku Shinpo Osaka, Tatsuiro Funatsu, Hibino, Setsu Aoki, Fumiyoshi Takeuchi, Masutaro Kimura, Itsuji Hishida, Naomasa Akamatsu, Seima Nikko, and more than forty others.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu, as chairman, delivered a speech. First, he elaborated on the significance of establishing the Municipal Consultation Committee, hoping that leaders from all sectors of the Japanese community would maintain regular contact to assist in promoting the improvement of municipal administration and to obtain the assistance of Japanese residents. Then, he gave a concise report on the recent improvements made by the Municipal Government, divided into three points: people's food supply, public security, and general municipal administration. After the speech, Li Sihao and Lin Kanghou successively explained the position and tasks of the Municipal Consultation Committee, as well as the work steps taken since its establishment, advancing them according to their urgency, and hoping that the Japanese gentlemen would not hesitate to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Speeches by Watanabe, Aoki, etc.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Residential Community President Watanabe delivered a speech, expressing his trust and gratification towards the Municipal Government, and expressing his hope to cooperate with the Municipal Government and use his best efforts to improve municipal administration. Then, Mr. Aoki Setsu delivered a speech, stating that in order to build Shanghai, it is necessary to sweep away the ideas of the Chinese, British, and Americans, and instill the citizens of Shanghai with the ideology of East Asia in order to unleash the excellent national character of the Chinese. Today, the Municipal Government is contacting powerful people from all sectors to work hard, and it will definitely be able to achieve this goal, but he hopes that it can be put into practice one by one. Japanese people will also be able to assist spiritually. President Osako then spoke briefly, saying that the citizens have great expectations for the Consultation Committee and hope that it will work hard. Shanghai is the gateway to China. If Shanghai is built successfully, the construction of the whole country will be successful, which will have a great impact. There are about 100,000 Japanese people in Shanghai. They should cooperate with the Chinese people, treat each other with sincerity, and be frank with each other. They will never take a bystander attitude. He hopes that the Chinese authorities will also take the same attitude, carefully adopt goodwill, and strive to make Sino-Japanese cooperation in Shanghai a model for the whole country.</p>
<p>Chen Binsu's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chen Binsu made a simple speech, saying that the severity of Shanghai's general problems can be said to have reached its peak, but it can only be overcome through the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese officials and people. The degree of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in the past still needs to be improved. He hopes the following from the Japanese people in the future: In the past, the Chinese people had a sense of fear when they came into contact with the Japanese people, which was an obstacle to achieving friendship. How to dispel the Chinese people's fear is something that the Japanese people should pay attention to. In the past, contact between the Chinese and Japanese people was biased towards formal exchanges between industrial and commercial leaders. In the future, it should be extended to all levels of the people in order to establish a base of emotional friendship. Japanese people will definitely be able to assist in various social undertakings in Shanghai, which will most easily arouse the goodwill of the Chinese people. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this. The tea party was full of sincere and harmonious opinions from both sides. The cordial discussion lasted for two hours, and the meeting ended at around six o'clock.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis Clinic Opens The Fourth Tuberculosis Clinic on Old Qi Qi Road, organized by the Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Public and Catholic Physicians Association, opened the day before yesterday. There were more than 200 guests, including Bishop Hui and Yu Yunzhou. The opening ceremony was officially held at 5 PM, with Liu Yongchun delivering the opening remarks and Yan Huiqing giving a speech on behalf of Fu Wenshou and others. They highly praised the clinic's enthusiasm for serving the community. On this day, more than 30,000 yuan in cash gifts were received from all sectors and were used for the clinic's expenses. However, because the invitations were sent out too close to the opening date, many people were unable to send gifts on time. It is believed that additional gifts will be sent in the next few days. According to the person in charge of the clinic, due to the tightening of living conditions in this city, the citizens are malnourished, and the tuberculosis situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is entirely dependent on the assistance of enthusiastic people from all sectors of society to help eliminate the germs and improve the health of the citizens.</p>

<p>Naval Painter (3)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Navy <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— By Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>In the summer of 1940, it wasn't very hot, so Takao didn't suffer even when he buried himself in his apartment all day to study. The room facing north, without sunlight, was cheap and the light never changed, which was extremely convenient. However, when he put up a large piece of canvas, he felt that the room was too small, even leaving no room to sleep.</p>
<p>He used No. 50 canvas, the first time he had ever used such a large one, and he was uneasy in his heart. This was a new direction for painting, and it was his first attempt. He had been painting landscapes for two years, but this attempt at creation was the first time he had ever done it.</p>
<p>The painting material was the image of Kurihama that had been turning over in his mind. It was the heavy cruiser of the Takao class, like a sea wolf, advancing through the waves. Rather than a posture, it was more like a phantom. He didn't depict a place like Kurihama, but only the ocean. What he intended to depict was not the shape of the Takao-class cruiser, but the impulse he felt when he saw this warship - that is, in the posture of this warship, he wanted to express the emotion that caused a major change in his life. So he decided to name the subject "Warship" and began to sketch with charcoal.</p>
<p>By the time the painting was finished, autumn winds were already blowing outside the apartment window. He could feel the coolness of the autumn wind on his tired body, but his mind was always on the painting. Although he could find unsatisfactory lines everywhere, he was infinitely happy because he had finished a creation.</p>
<p>He didn't want to sell this painting, nor did he want to exhibit it. He didn't have that purpose in the first place, nor did he hope it would have that value. He decided not to frame it and display it, but just to take it off the frame, roll it up, and put it aside. Otherwise, the room with three tatami mats would feel cramped.</p>
<p>(However, before doing this, I should let Mr. Ichiki take a look.)</p>
<p>Indeed, if he didn't let someone else see it and just put it away, he would really feel sorry. But moving it to Mr. Ichiki's house in Senzoku station was indeed a big problem. Taking it by train would be a large undertaking. Finally, he entrusted it to a moving company and went ahead, waiting in front of Mr. Ichiki's house.</p>
<p>September was a slightly cold atmosphere. Takao was wearing a twill uniform and a woolen vest, and his fluffy hair was being played with by the north wind, as he arrived at Senzoku Station on the Ikegami Railway.</p>
<p>"Hey, Mutaguchi, where are you going?"</p>
<p>Turning around, he saw the painter Tsuruhara. Although they had often met since they had dinner at the yakitori restaurant, this was the first time since he had resigned from the Barido.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm going to Mr. Ichiki's house."</p>
<p>"I'm going to his house too, then let's go together!"</p>
<p>Takao felt a little uncomfortable. He only wanted Mr. Ichiki to see that painting. (102)</p>
