<p>民國三十三年到今天已是最後一天了。</p>
<p>一年又要過去，我們在這一年來究竟做些過什麽呢？</p>
<p>汪故主席於今年元旦那天的訓詞中，曾指示我們今年的一年，應向着「肅正思想」，「保障治安」，「增加生產」三大工作，爲更進一步的努力，我們究竟怎樣努力過？有過怎樣的成績？抑或反不如前？</p>
<p>陳代主席於元旦那天的告上海市民書中，曾指出上海有一件畸形的事和一件矛盾的事，畸形的是一般人正常所得不夠糊口，以致綱紀岌岌，社會騷然；矛盾的是生產應當增加，却因缺乏燃料而減少生產，囤積原料牟利而懶得生產，以致前方不能得到充分的供給，後方不能得到適當的生活。這些情形其實不僅上海一地爲然，許多地方都差不多。今年我們有沒有把這畸形和矛盾的事克服呢？克服過多少？抑或程度更深？</p>
<p>元旦日本報社評也曾經提出今年度的三點希望，第一是「希望政治清明」，第二是「希望解除人民疾苦」，第三是「希望實踐參戰任務」。一年間我們的希望實現了多少？抑或失望更甚？</p>
<p>汪故主席所訓示的「肅正思想」，與我們所希望的「政治清明」，實是不可分離的，惟有「肅正思想」，方可以使「政治清明」，祗有清明的政治，才可以把思想肅正。汪故主席在「肅正思想」上又指示我們：「所有足以妨害決戰意志之昂揚，斷喪民族精神之振奮的，必須一一　陷而廓清之」，如「貪污賣職，是腐蝕政治的惡菌；囤積居奇，是荼毒民生的蠹虫；敲詐勒索，是擾亂社會的禍根；頹廢放蕩，是削弱種族的毒素」。貪污賣職旣是腐蝕政治的惡菌，很痛心的，今年貪污賣職事件，自后胡顧周大貪污案，上海特稅大舞弊案及米統會職員作弊案以次，層見疊出，試問政治何從清明。囤積居奇和敲詐勒索，實際上今年大宗囤積居奇，操縱物資，激動物價行爲，比去年益見猖獗，不少且有特殊勢力作背景；而非　政治力量或槍杆子做後盾不可的敲詐勒索事件，今年更是到處公然橫行，別的不說，最普通的　要你出過門，在碼頭上，在車站上，在舟車中，以至在馬路上，你終必身受過或眼見過這類事件，如果你身旁帶有什麽物件，那你就愈加有被敲案的機會。在這樣烏烟瘴氣之下，那足以成爲削弱種族的毒素的頹廢放蕩生活，越弄越不成樣，便是必然的了。</p>
<p>思想旣如此不能肅正，政治紀律及社會風氣又旣如此敗壞，甚且每況愈下，那末，怎樣還能完成「保障治安」和「增加生產」呢？又怎樣還能實現我們所期望的「解除人民痛苦」，「實踐參戰任務」呢？</p>
<p>現在不但各地匪賊還未肅清，且具有政治背景及以槍杆子做後盾的敲詐勒索事件，又到處有聞，使治安更難獲得保障，人民無從安居樂業。又我們是參戰的國家，目前連許多地方的後方治安，也仍要盟邦軍隊來維持，實在太覺得慚愧。</p>
<p>生產方面因政治紀律未臻健全，治安未得保障，以致各種經濟政策，統制設施等，都沒有好好推行；物資收買對策和配合施策等，也都沒有法子使其合理，影響增產，自然很大。今年各種生產事業的衰落，無庸　言的，已至非常嚴重的地步。</p>
<p>關於民生問題，目前我們極大多數人民不斷受治安不良的影響，敲詐勒索的打擊，高物價的摧殘，生活實已窘困到無法支撐的境地。陳代主席所說「一般人正常多得不夠糊口」的畸形現象，現在差不多已成爲最通常的事情。所謂「民不聊生」，恐怕再沒有像目前這樣慘重了。人民奄奄一息，我們怎樣還能談得到實踐參戰的任務呢？</p>
<p>上述種種，今天歲尾我們必須作澈底的反省，從明天起，不論政府和人民，都要痛加改勉。如果還是徒托空言，因循苟且地下去，那末，前途便要不堪設想了。</p>
<h3 id="c8">抑平物價與執行法規 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 夢騶</p>
<p>抑平物價，必須管理物資，這是有識者共同的生張。但是要想抑平物價，管理物資，必先規定完備妥善切實易行的管理辦法，然後可以依據辦法，認真執行。譬如陸上運輸必先開闢道路，然後可以遵循道路而前進，不至誤入歧途。現在關於物價及物資的管理辦法，雖也曾制定各種法規，但是由我們重來，尚不免於粗製濫造，掛一漏萬。例如存貨登記，同時就應該明定如何儲藏，如何分配，如何作價等詳細辦法，然後主管機構才能有所依據，以爲執行，如果不先定明詳細辦法，等到問題發生，再來設法應付，那末必至任意措置，弊端百出。所以不完備的辦法，猶如沒有道路一樣，在沒有道路的地方，行駛車輛，必至傾覆。又關於物價及物資縱已定有詳細辦法，但是所定辦法，如果並不妥善，難於實行，那末這辦法就猶如崎嶇不平阻塞不通的道路一樣，車輛決不能在道上行駛，結果也必至　棄不用。照這種情形的結果，所定辦法也就成爲具文了。所以爲要達到管理物資抑平物價的目的起見，第一步應該規定完備妥善切實易行的管理辦法。</p>
<p>有了完備妥善切實易行的管理辦法，而沒有權力集中各實合一的主管機構來執行，這辦法也就不能發生實效。機構猶如車輛，如果車輛枯朽不適實用，那末道路雖然砥平可以直達，也就無法行駛。現在關於物價及物資的管理，地方的各種公團官廳與軍營之間，往往是彼此爭攬，互相推諉，這都是各種機構的組權限未經詳密規定的緣故。如能關於物價明定專歸甲機構負責管理，關於配給明定專歸乙機關担任實施，關於囤積明定專歸丙機構全權取締，那末彼此之間，權限分清，責任明確，自然可以杜絕爭攬推諉的弊害。又軍警機關在名議上，對於物價及物資原無主管的權限，但是實際上，因軍警持有實力，且確有軍需及治安的必要，對於物價物資有關的事項，不免爲過分的協助，所以名實不符的事件，時常發生，如果政府不能使主管機構具備足以執行的實力，同時又難限止軍警的參與，那末不妨兼顧事實，明定以某地區某時期爲限，由軍警負責主管某一事項，庶幾權責分明，名實合一，功罪不至無所歸龐。所以抑平物價管理物資的第二步，應該設置權力集中名實合一的主管機構。</p>
<p>關於物價及物資的管理辦法，要使他完備妥善，切實易行，關於主管機構的組織權限，要使他權力集中，名實合一，這都是法規所應規定的事項。所以制定良好的法規，實於抑平物價管理物資最關重要。不過有了良好的法規，還要有奉公守法的人員來担任執行，這法規的職務，才能達到目的。猶如道路完成車輛具備之後，必須有人駕駛同一情形。但是担任執行法規職務的人員，只要能奉公守法，也就可以勝任，並不必其人是奇才異能，凡自命是奇才異能的人，往往不願謹守範圍，反多破壞法規的情事。實則某法規如果是窒碍難行，儘可呈請修改，而在未改以前，必須嚴格遵守，不容蔑視。如果某法規尚未完備，也儘可自行解釋該法規後擬定辦法，呈請上級核准，作爲成例，以資依據，也不容擅自主張，草率變例。總之，破壞法規擅變成例，都是便於舞弊，成爲貪污之源，所以抑平物價管理物資的第三步，應該選拔奉公守法的人員，使担任執行的職務。</p>
<p>上述三個步驟，原是同樣重要，中國人素來主張人治，不講法治，對於法規的制定旣不注重，迨法規制定之後，也就視爲其文，日久遺忘。照這種情形，要想政治納入常軌，眞是南轅北轍，所以嚴格執行法規，實在是抑平物價的先決問題，不可不加以注意。至於担任執行職務的人員，要使他們都能奉公守法，也不是一件容易的事，倘非立身勤儉，就不能奉公，倘非熟讀法規，就不知守法，所以官廳及公團必須選拔勤儉好讀的人，使担任職務，才能弊絕風清，無如一般有　用人的，當局偏把浮華活動的人，當作俊傑，對於勤儉好讀的人，不加青睞，風氣所趨，於是奉公守法，認爲不合時宜，便成鳳毛麟角了。</p>

<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　紐約訊，美記者皮亞遜二十八日於「每日勝報」發表一文，說明蘇聯拒絕美軍使用蘇領基地事，其大意如次：蘇聯政府曾通知美政府，今後禁止美軍用機於蘇聯領土內降陸，因此美空軍前此利用蘇境機塲實行轟炸者，今後不能繼續矣。德國已將一部軍需工廠，遷至波瀾佔領地域，美軍若不能利用蘇境機塲以實施轟炸，則德軍即可對比利時之反攻作戰充分補給。蘇聯對資本主義世界，久報不信任心理，今次復取禁止反軸心各國飛機通過蘇領之政策，殊屬令人不解。美陸軍航空隊參謀長江爾斯，前於九月十五日會見記者團時曾稱，美蘇兩政府因極寒及其他氣候原因，　同時巴爾幹各國之主要轟炸目標，皆被反軸心軍佔領，故今後不由蘇聯基地轟炸之意見已見一致，由此事項可窺見反軸心國家不和之一斑。</p>

<p>本期戶口配給米，業由物品配給處公吿發售，計每證可領米一升半，共價國幣九十七元半，就數量及價格而論，與上期稍有出入，以此外界頗多疑問，該處處長馮攸發表意見如下：</p>
<p>舊糧食局管轄區域內之戶口食米配給，已於本月二十九日終了，自卅日起本處巳公吿開始配給，本期舊一八兩區之戶口食米，此次配給數量，所以自兩升減爲一升半者，因收買機關最近購得雜糧作爲補助配給之用，以期勵行戰時生活，因此經有關方面商定本期食米減配半升，另外搭配雜糧一斤（豆類）約合食米半升以上，故事實上等於仍維持兩升之配給量。至於雜糧一斤之配給布吿，雖因出貨關係不及與配米布吿同時發表，但一月初旬即可實施配給。要之本期配給減去半升之理由，在於搭配雜糧，幷非從此改爲一升半，如下次毋需搭配雜糧，即當恢復二升之配給。至於此次配給米價格方面，亦略爲提高，計每升售價爲六十五元，其原因乃因採辦機關之外地採辦運旨等成本，受其他物價影響，有所增加，因此本處之配給價格亦不得不略予提高，要之本處深知目下市民受黑市米價激漲影響，苦楚已極，對於現在每升六十五元，即每担六千五百元之價，目當盡力維持，以安民生。市府亦正在設法籌劃繼續借款，或從整理稅收方法劃出金額，以資補助，務求配給光價，得繼續維持，使一般市民可獲得低廉之食糧。</p>

<p>當馬里亞納羣島戰事正股之際，有四個勇士，海軍一等兵曹瀨崎　，水兵長金川達雄，船員長谷正雄及迫田國夫，從大宮島脫出，在海上飄流四十天，航行千餘里，終於平安生還，他們四人，本屬第〇〇氣象隊，爲該隊〇〇船朝陽丸（二四〇噸）的船員，與大宮島守備隊本無關係，只因聯途偶經該島，適逢敵軍進攻該處，遂被捲入渦中。其後：他們奉長官之命，脫出該島，突破敵艦艇，飛機羣的包圍網，歷經艱險，奇蹟地生還。以下便是瀨崎，金川二氏所述的梗槪。</p>
<p>發現敵艦</p>
<p>瀕崎一等兵曹等所乘的第二朝陽丸，因須修理船體，奉命經由大宮島而駛歸內地。這是六月初旬的事情。同月十一日，在大宮鳥附近航行時，看見友機二十架急急向塞班島飛去，心機總有什麼事故發生了。同夜，望見敵艦隊的照明彈，海上的情形很亂，於是確切知道敵機動部隊的來襲。</p>
<p>翌日（十二日）未明，依照預定，在距離大宮島昭和街二浬的海面拋錨。這是，恰逢敵艦載機正在空襲之時。微明的天空，蔽滿了敵機，港內的船舶及地上部隊猛烈地和它們對抗。不久，朝陽丸也受到三架格拉曼戰鬥機的掃射，我們當即起而應戰，旋因發生火災，全體只好上陸。上海之後，全體立刻趕到〇〇隊本部，報吿戰况行動。爲備敵軍在大宮島登陸起見，立即編成陸戰隊，瀨崎一等兵曾等配屬於某某少尉指揮的某某隊，由瀨崎一等兵曹任〇隊長。</p>
<p>六月十六日起，敵機的轟炸更形猛烈，每次來襲的機數超過二百架，每日累計達千架以上。而且，從那日起，敵戰艦羣也駛近該島，開始艦砲射擊。當時，傲然在我們眼前航行的敵美新銳戰艦羣中，其第三隻（四萬噸級）突然爆炸，湧起了很大的火柱，接着就沉沒了。這是我方潛艇奇襲的結果。我們看到了，不覺大呼萬歲。從這一天起，直到七月七日止，敵軍海空雙方的攻擊，沒有間斷，沿岸的我軍陣地，悉因艦砲的集中射擊而破壞無遺，海軍部隊不得已只好沿萌加山一帶布防，瀨崎一等兵曹等的〇〇隊則轉進哈可耶河。</p>
<p>奮起擊敵</p>
<p>到了七月十九日，敵軍企圖上陸益亟，航空母艦和戰艦駛近海岸，開始猛攻。在望遠鏡裏望到美國砲兵捲起袖口，啣着香烟，從容不迫地開砲的樣子，眞呌人恨得牙癢癢地呀！</p>
<p>不久，敵軍用五十輛水陸兩用坦克車打前鋒，在昭街方面上陸約五萬士兵．我陸海軍守備隊當即奮起邀擊，使其死傷一萬五千人，但我方的損失也不小，只好退守折田村的新防綫。這時，敵軍更派後續部隊進犯北斗岬。</p>
<p>自此到七月二十二日止的戰况，簡而言之，便　是敵軍的火力佔優勢，我守備部隊縱然驍勇善戰，亦難挽回局，只好遂漸轉進，最後總攻擊的時機終於成熟，到了八月七日，我軍已因敵戰車羣而陷於孤立，但全軍士氣因此更爲激昂，誓必戰至最後。</p>
<p>崎一等兵　等的中隊，爲了遂行任務，突破敵輩包圍向白濱海岸轉　，各小隊分散，携帶發信機，收信機等，潛入密林。從這時起，島民的間諜行爲甚盛，我們的行動常被他們報吿給敵軍。敵機時常關住引擎，在密林的上空滑翔，並與海上的艦艇互通聲氣，不斷實行集中的砲擊和轟炸。敵軍戰車縱橫馳驅，用火焰放射器放火焚燒密林，並在道路上密張電綫，不愼觸動了它。立可受到集中攻擊。瀨崎一等兵曹等穿越了這種種障礙，繼續前進，於八月九日黎明，發見道中有一翱敵軍戰車，偸偸爬近去，美兵還在戰車內高臥未起，當即製以手溜彈數枚，將它炸毀，然後縱續向白　村前進。不料敵軍也已殺到該村，只得閃入海岸的洞窟內待機。集合查點人數，自中隊長以下，一共廿四名。〇〇隊長是巳經戰死了。</p>
<p>八月十五日，中隊長知道島上的戰事已很嚴重，決心募集敢死隊，派遣連絡員到內地去。瀨崎一等兵曹等四人，立即應募，不辭萬死以完成此項任務。所需船隻，經搜尋之後，總算在叢林內找到二隻陸軍九五式折疊渡河用舟艇，當即修好一隻，造　　，樹帆柱，並裝上糙米一斗三升，椰子一百個，雨水一響油桶，乾麵包若干。舟艇由一分五厘厚的轉合板造成，長十五尺，闊五尺。</p>
<p>八月廿日夜，　崎等接奉命令　：</p>
<p>「茲令　畸一等兵曹等四人於八月廿日自白濱海岸乘渡河用舟艇脫離大宮島。願各位武運久長。第〇〇〇隊陸戰隊指揮官海軍少尉某。」</p>
<p>黑夜脫離</p>
<p>先是，十九日夜洛泰附近的敵機動部隊似有移動模樣，海上敵軍的監視甚嚴，因而　崎等的出發不得不延遲一天，至廿一日夜七時始有機會離島。在敵軍海陸雙方的嚴密監視下，四人悄悄離島，但立刻被敵方監視艇發覺，受到槍擊，幸虧巧妙利用夜色，逃出虎口，不過長谷，迫田兩船員的肩腹終於掛了彩。由於敵軍監視甚嚴的緣故，小艇在洛泰和大宮島之間徘徊了三天。到了第四天，負傷者元氣稍復，方始偸過警戒綫，靠着手錶式的指南針和海軍日記上撕下來的海圖及天上的星辰，在海上駛行十三天。這期間常有敵機飛來，而且大宮廳的島影始終隱現於視界中，到了晚上，遙遙望見想係明石街飛行塲的地方閃爍着電燈光；想到敵軍正在趕修飛行塲時，心中的憤慨，難以名狀。</p>
<p>到了九月六日，方始望不見大宮鳥。其後，淡水漸吿不足。九月二十一日，好容易發見鳥影，猜想已到台灣或琉球附近了。不料二十三日突起暴風，小艇被速率三十米的大風所挾，身不由主地一連飄流了三日三夜，直到第四天早晨，天氣才吿晴朗。這時，桶中已積了相當的淡水，元氣也都恢復，而且知道小艇已乘上所期待的黑潮了。第五日晨，再張起帆來，取道西北，小艇追風疾駛，船尾泛起白沫，沙丁魚成羣，追逐艇後。正愁絕糧，看到這些，不藥相顧大樂，馬上用紗布做綱，捉了四五十條，生吞活噬地吃下肚去</p>
<p>友機來助</p>
<p>以後又在海上航行了一星期，望見七架友軍飛次看到巴方的飛機，過去只見敵機。因此，大家都很興奮。金川兵長本是信號兵。當即發出求救的信號。但友機都另有重要任務，未　救助，由一架投下食糧一包以後，即匆匆飛走。不過，旣已碰到友機，便　覺勇氣倍增，況且還看到有海草和木片等物流過來，大家都爲了已近陸地而興奮。</p>
<p>九月三十日晨，發見三個島嶼。正午抵島，爲中國漁夫救起，那邊原來是近着上海的舟山羣鳥的一個島嶼。在抵島以前，已經絕糧兩星期，每日三餐光喝海水。在島上休養三日以後，與海軍警備隊取得連絡。十月九日抵達上海，歸還當地部隊，報吿一切。（川野報道班員）（譯自十二月一日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 侯千里</p>
<p>聯華女子初級中學的初中三敎室裏鬧翻了天。</p>
<p>這天是考試，考幾何。</p>
<p>可是一點也不像考試前十分鐘的樣子。</p>
<p>黃明芬早上一進敎室門，就直着嗓子吿訴大家：昨天在兆豐公園看見何先生，同着另外一個人。</p>
<p>「誰？」大家同聲地，並且心急地。</p>
<p>「你們猜猜看！」報吿者故意賣了個關子</p>
<p>自然猜不着。於是黃明芬就呌起來：</p>
<p>「是劉淑珍！」</p>
<p>劉淑珍大家都認識。今年暑假才畢業的。</p>
<p>許多人不相信，可是黃明芬賭着咒，說如果　錯或者造謠言，她就不是人。</p>
<p>「再不然，等會你們問何光生自己。」</p>
<p>上課了，何先生帶了考卷進來。</p>
<p>大家互相做了一些鬼臉，終於黃明芬說：</p>
<p>「何先生，昨天我們到兆豐公園去，坐在柳樹底下，談得眞開心！」</p>
<p>敎室裏都轟的笑起來。</p>
<p>那個何先生臉立刻紅起來了。</p>
<p>何先生常常紅臉。何先生今年只有二十三歲，還在大學裏唸書，唸電機的，明年畢業。</p>
<p>還沒來得及回答，大家日經亂開鬨地。</p>
<p>「談得開心得來是不是？」</p>
<p>「怪不得劉淑珍這回不大到學校裏來玩了。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>沒有人想到考試。</p>
<p>忽然有人呌起來：</p>
<p>「請吃糖！」</p>
<p>「糖！糖！吃糖！」大家都吃着，笑着。</p>
<p>「今天先考！」何先生終於說話了：「明天再講！」</p>
<p>怕那個先生賴掉，於是大家在考好的時候，又重複一遍；</p>
<p>「不要忘記明天帶糖來呀！」</p>
<p>何先生沒有忘記。明天眞的帶來了，可是不是糖，是蜜棗，每人兩顆。</p>
<p>於是敎室裏充滿快活的空氣。</p>
<p>何先生是敎幾何的也敎化學。</p>
<p>何先生頭腦非常冷靜，證明幾何定理和計算化學方程式的時候，眞可仔細得不得了。</p>
<p>可是這一件事，不知怎麽一來，他糊塗起來。</p>
<p>一個多月以前，他連目已不知道怎麼突然地寄出了那封給劉淑珍的信，他甚至於已經忘了那裏面是怎橡寫的。到現在想起來，眞好像做了夢。</p>
<p>然而別人可一點也不當他做夢。一位同事在劉淑珍家門口遇見了他，於是他又請同事們吃了一回糖。有幾位女先生甚至於向他恭喜了。</p>
<p>他對於這些很滿意他也很得意。</p>
<p>然而，煩惱也終於來了。</p>
<p>起先，是劉淑珍那個孩子吿訴他，她底父親知道了這件事，似乎頗有些微言，並且，意思之間，連下學期的求學也成問題了，那個古老的父親下個定義：</p>
<p>「女學堂裏的男先生沒有好的。」</p>
<p>其次，聯華的校長請他去談了一次話，那位校長先生告訴他，何先生和劉淑珍的事在學生中巳成了「公開的秘密」了。並且，校長本人也聽到一些家長方面的輿論，對這學校很有指摘之處。尤其是女學校，校風很要緊的。</p>
<p>最後，那位校長先生以老前輩的資格勸吿他：</p>
<p>「所以，我說，何先生，不是你見氣的話，這類事還是謹愼一點爲妙！對於你自己沒有什處好處，你明年大學要畢業，可不能爲了這些事化費不少時間。再說，對於學校，也是不大好聽的事，許多家長都知道，而且不滿意，長此以往，會對學生的增加有影響的！」</p>
<p>可是，學生對於這件事倒是非常熱心的。那些女孩子們不斷地向這位幾何先生打聽最近的發展，固執地探詢一些零碎的小問題。例如劉淑珍怎麼稱呼他，信上怎麽寫，談些什麽話，是不是每星期日都到兆豐公園去，不去又怎麽樣之類。</p>
<p>年青的先生對於這些問題都詳細地回答，甚至比他解釋幾何定理還要詳細。不爲什麽，他只覺得滿是高興。</p>
<p>而家長可終於有人寫信來詰問了，那位家長非常嚴厲地詢問學校當局是吾可以容許敎師有這種行爲？可曾想過對於學生的影響？一個敎師是否可以這樣做？</p>
<p>學校當局無法回答這些問題。</p>
<p>於是，校長可請何先生請了一次話。</p>
<p>何先生看了那封信。他非常明瞭，自己該怎麽辦，校長又是希望他怎麽辦。</p>
<p>「我想請個長假，」接着他又補充一句：「功課忙。」上面說過，何先生明年大學畢業。</p>
<p>「也好，這一避鋒頭再說。」校長先生可非常同情。</p>
<p>從校長室出來，在棲梯上又給初中二的學生攔住。「我們也要吃糖。童秀娟昨天在大光明門口看見你的。……明天一定要帶來！」</p>
<p>何先生向她們笑一下。臉皮有紅？</p>

<p>— 袁栩</p>
<p>有一次，我發現自已，在鏡子前面。——這並不是說：我以前沒有照過鏡子，倒是我的疏忽和自以爲很忙碌所致。——　，是這樣的一個蠢傢伙，眼觀鼻，鼻觀心，一付斯文的樣子。</p>
<p>於是乎我沉默，像這樣的人，述悲哀也懶得了。</p>
<p>假若人生眞是一條路，那麽，我走過也有一小半了；賸下的一大半，我不知道怎樣，惟其我沒有堅決的自信，纔不免茫茫然了。其實，像這樣的人是很少對將來有甚麽蔪求，於過去有了大懺悔的。</p>
<p>我的祖父，縱就在他生前沒有甚麽不朽或者遣臭，不過他確實辛苦過，把家擱在自己肩臉上的。之後，我父親會一筆好字，却不大出門爲生活奔波了。而至我，連一筆字也爲得不好，遑論經營商賈之業了。照例想來，這不免是很大的悲哀；好在我是這樣的蠢，麻木和懦弱，也就懶得去想，去悲哀了。這樣，就難免替壁上的蝸牛太息，艱苦的忍受，默默的爬動，畎着記憶的硬壳，幾時纔能卸下背上逾量的負擔呢，——你們那般殉道者呵。</p>
<p>誠然，蝸牛是不幸的。這樣看來，我似乎很聰明；然而，這纔是莫大的悲哀。由是，連最不善記憶，悲哀的人也會悲哀了。</p>
<p>我再注意自已：眼，耳，鼻甚至嘴巴一點也不像這個時代的人；以前在鄕下撒野慣了，所以難免有一點泥土氣，或這正是愚蠢的原因吧。我不像政客，賈人，學者，名士，自然也不是詩人。「那麼，你是甚麽呢？」也許你會問。好吧，你何不去問問黏在桑幹上的皮虫，他躱在薄薄的壳裏幹些甚麽，等待些甚麽呢？</p>
<p>你能得到甚麽回答？</p>
<p>沒有，因爲它愚蠢</p>
<p>由於此，我沉默了</p>
<p>有人說：愚蠢是不可恕的，然而，我能寬恕自己麽。——請告訴我。</p>
<h3 id="c37">評「飆」第二期 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 陳心</p>
<p>十月間，創刋號的綜合性的雜誌「颷」在文壇上出現，帶給人們一個新頴的感覺，當這種感覺還保留在讀者心頭的時候，第二期的「颷」出版了。</p>
<p>第二期的「颷」在內容上是編重於文藝方面的，作爲內容的主體的是六篇小說，四篇散文和四首詩。連載方面，除了毛羽的「兒女風雲」以後，增加了孫了紅的「夜獵記」，作者還是保持那份獨特的風格，一字一句都扣住讀者的心弦，雖是還沒完，但一開始便呌人毛骨悚然，透不過氣來。</p>
<p>我要特別提起的是徐翊的散文「釣」，在風格上，很逼近蘆焚的「孟安卿的堂兄弟」作者用他底生動的筆觸，爲我們描出一個熟悉的影子。曾在他處說過作者其他散文的，我希望再讀到和「釣」一樣的作品。</p>
<p>編排生動活潑，和新鮮觸目的一色藍封面，也是很可行人們注意力的。二百元的代價，比較起來，不算吃虧。如果還有所要求的話，那就在內容水準的提高，別讓一些不充實的作品糟踏紙張。也讓讚者們在這柴荒米貴的年頭，化了一筆錢以外，能實在地得到一點可使心靈充實滿足的東西。</p>
<h3 id="c38">詩之王國 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 谷戈</p>
<p>不要桂冠，</p>
<p>不要手杖，</p>
<p>不要寳座和宮殿，</p>
<p>反對羈持和超特，</p>
<p>鄙視一切披金衣的「詩人」，</p>
<p>絕對否認詩之王國！</p>
<p>我們要唱出呼號，</p>
<p>我們要化詩篇爲</p>
<p>人類的號角，</p>
<p>要從下賤的血淚，</p>
<p>發出强烈愛憎，</p>
<p>化星火爲燎原，</p>

<p>— 白文</p>
<p>塔是叛徒的寳劍，</p>
<p>尖鋒直刺向天心。</p>
<p>遍體佈玲瓏的孔穴，</p>
<p>穴內曾閃過，</p>
<p>古代王妃的倩影。</p>
<p>有一天忽以一個神奇的故事，</p>
<p>塔遂爲人們畏懼而崇敬；</p>
<p>如今它已攀滿了籘夢；</p>
<p>不再有好事的少年冒險攀登。</p>
<p>是遠久朝代的帝王，</p>
<p>爲頌揚他自己的尊嚴與功蹟，</p>
<p>乃徵用萬千的夫役，</p>
<p>以他們的血與肉築成了塔基。</p>
<p>或者是虔誠的僧侶，</p>
<p>爲記念佛的偉大。</p>
<p>於是以上天的名義，</p>
<p>向四海的善男信女們募化：</p>
<p>過去的歷史漸漸不爲人所記憶，</p>
<p>塔遂成爲一個謎。</p>
<p>現在裕孤立在山巔，</p>
<p>徒供後世的憑弔，</p>
<p>人們除嘖嘖稱羨它的宏偉。</p>
<p>還夢幻塔內傳說中的女妖。</p>
<p>時間一年年地過去，</p>
<p>靑藤枯萎了又變成嫩綠，</p>
<p>有時正値睛和的春分，</p>
<p>塔的四周圍滿了瞻仰的遊人；</p>
<p>有時山下起了　火，</p>
<p>塔乃陷入了無比的寂寞，</p>
<p>雖然存着一個不爲人了解的悲哀</p>
<p>但它沉默着，</p>
<p>有一個等待。</p>
<p>某日傍晚來了一個老者，</p>
<p>（我聽見過這塔的父老們傳說）</p>
<p>他是許多年在外流浪的鄕人，</p>
<p>現在頽然圓來了，</p>
<p>帶着疲倦一身，</p>
<p>他摸索着靠近了塔。</p>
<p>想用昏花的老眼，</p>
<p>去尋找他靑春的創痕；</p>
<p>他喃喃地哀訴着，</p>
<p>沉默的塔也起了呻吟。</p>
<p>於是在一個深深的</p>
<p>深深的午夜，</p>
<p>塔遂互吼一聲，</p>
<p>與他一同結束了生命。</p>

<p>申報盃籃球聯賽乙組決賽及女組比賽，自上週三（二十日）開始以來，經過一番競爭，乙組汕隊迭克强敵，最後決賽，又以一分之差，壓倒仁餘，榮獲總冠軍，誠稱佳搆。女組綠隊以超然之表演，每戰輕易致勝，膺申報盃女組室座。綠隊在巾幗所向所敵，足以自豪矣。本週五盃賽畢，由本報陳社長主持給獎。計甲狙中北華聯各得銀杯一座，中北由汪隊長仲陶，華聯隊長孔廣益主領。乙組錦標汕隊則由主幹林作詩。女組綠隊隊長李　芝未到，乃由副隊長黃明媛捧去銀杯。于是申報盃至此功德圓滿。致此番本報辦籃球聯賽，諸承各方面之協助，乃得一本初衷，旣符合提倡籃球之旨，而所獲劵資，相當可觀。助學金方面獲益不淺，不得不使本報感澈無已。聯賽自十月六日開賽迄今，將近三月，至此圓滿結束矣。</p>
<p>汕隊榮膺　乙組冠軍</p>
<p>乙組決賽採淘汰制。五塲角逐中，均有極上好之表演，緊凑之過程，有謂不在甲組之下，不爲渦也。而最後決賽汕隊仁餘之役，又各盡其力，競爭之烈，得未曾有，結果汕隊以二十五對二十四倖勝一分。</p>
<p>觀兩隊實力，不媿勢均力敵，隊員頗多沙塲老將，方法亦俱有甲組各隊員之董陶，極能正軌道上進展。今日之乙組强旅，則他日之甲組隊伍，進而稱雄滬上，將以此爲發軔點矣。勉各小將本此精神，繼續努力以往，有原望　。</p>
<p>女組綠隊　完成覇業</p>
<p>女子組加入者五隊，除綠隊別優異，其他隊相差無多，故一番女將相鬥，演出另有風光，略介紹覇主綠隊之各方面，先錄盃賽中之成績。</p>
<p>綠隊勝雪白　四八—一五</p>
<p>綠隊勝三省　五〇—一一</p>
<p>綠隊勝華東　六二—一五</p>
<p>綠隊勝益康　三八—一四</p>
<p>觀乎綠隊每塲勝分之多，不愧滬壇巾幗盟主，加以該隊在管理謝益欽之策劃下不斷練習。敎練官錢旭滄，費盡心血指點。領隊薛春生之勗勉有加，在如此情形之下，自兩日新月異，何怪一般後起之隊，難與頡頑也。綜觀綠人避人竄入之成功，而純與夫投籃之正確，令人嘆爲觀止。致個人方面，黃明媛容淑儉果皆在正常狀態中，而嚴蔚雯則有特殊環境，拿球運球亦已臻純靑之境，益以其素擅之長射，於是嚴小姐便成爲一標準中鋒良將矣。致後衛方面，王維珍劉珍寳汪印蘭三將，個人技術，已登峯造極，在方法則三將採人釘人，各司其職，逼人之技，緊追不放，而球路明白故敵鋒當者，實難望越過。綠隊失分之少，則爲三人之功勞也。以此强硬之陣容，崑有不得全勝。後備軍如楊文鵑竺承然等，亦俱爲有希望之健將</p>
<p>新進女將演出殊佳</p>
<p>各新興隊伍中，益康雪白華東三隊，以小將之軍，演出卯上，益康隊諸將能循敎練之話做去，循規蹈矩，極少錯誤。其所以不能揚威者，尙少經騐較淺，個人技術稍差耳。雪白隊每塲有顯著之進境，此應歸功於領隊陳漢泉指導張覺非之努力，其最後與三省一役，究然戰成平手，其進步之速，於此可見。前鋒張蕙玲之活潑，蕭瑛之多才，盛景漱之穩健，皆慶可取，其聯絡之妙，尤爲不可多得。後衛三將，張秀麗黃如玉等皆活潑有勁，可造之材，來日前途，未可限量。華東隊大部係中立女中學生參加，許瑞　　　修等健將，合作伊始，不免不　。總之，各新隊，積　旣如此之佳，萬望希此努力，其造就可有意料之中，勉之！勉之！（功）</p>

<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>中葡盃賽足球賽十年前舉辦，每屆有熱烈之盛况，猶縈迴於吾人腦際。唯自戰後，停頓迄今。此番足聯會恢復此項盃賽，蓋中葡兩國，俱有足球界之　星，必能在球藝方面，儘量發揮。而觀衆之擁擠，又必在臆料之中。茲據悉該賽此次仍採三賽二勝制，第一戰已確定於三十四年元旦日交鋒。葡商陣容，已經公佈，中華名單，亦有披露。所選中華健將有十八人之多。現葡隊旣有陣容，則筆者乘此作對症之陣容貢獻焉。</p>

<p>細察葡隊之攻勢，完全趨於左方。右路將僅恃乎福恩一人，亦以爲福恩之竄勁，大可揚威一時。此果屬實，適我中華左後衛用天生或李寗。以福恩之够勁，兩李之老態，必未能遏止。故筆者極以爲左後衛一職，照目下之近况而言，非吳祺祥莫屬。蓋老吳近况彌佳，非老吳亦斷難阻福恩馬蹄式之快馳也。况祺祥左右脚俱來得，勝任愉快，毫無疑議。當局似必要重用天生李寗者，或有其苦衷。但本人在戰術方面，公正立塲而言，應捨兩李而用吳祺祥也。但必有以爲祺祥之左移，右後衛乃成問題，此又不作釜底抽薪之想。蓋張林根固後衛之標準上將，其所以在東華隊中充前衛者，因東華前衛之缺少，唯張之作風，總未能臻前衛之佳境，始終具後衛之面目。故以林根充右後衛，豈有不當之理。常局其能納我一言乎？中衛錢上，筆者又有貢獻，應以宋靈聖爲中堅。蓋葡隊之陣容上着想，必在守中取勢，則華隊極宜取攻勢，以宋之善於帶球，坐鎭中央，前呼後應，必無差池。右前衛一職，應由鄭英擢担任，鄭近况不差，脚頭與帶球，俱見在進展狀態中。奔馳相當迅速，萬無不當之理，致左前衛，我以爲應用鐔福楨，有謂老鐔從未試前衛，何必令其輕試。但我言，譯之演出，何曾不能一試左前衛。况宋靈聖試左前衛，從無成功之佳作。以老鐔之善作退爲第三後衛，補後衛之不足，有何不可。進而言之，以之死釘福恩，賴其人長之特點，保險可關煞福恩之活躍，切望勿以老鐔從未試過前衛而非。抑知嘗試之下，不有所成。况在戰術方面，亦極說得過去也。</p>
<p>前綫上，我主張爲李　　之中鋒，韓龍海之右鋒，賈幼良之右翼，孫錦順之左鋒，李垚之左翼。果然，對方之陣綫而觀，阻孫李之連擊，及截止幼良之活躍，均有相當佈置。但我以爲幼良可與龍海隨時易位，使對方捉摸不定，再觀乎軍華葡商之戰，考司坦亦未必遏得住幼良，維克泰之徒勇，又何足道哉，致孫錦順必爲萊遼，李垚亦必爲格林堡死釘，但對方旣抱犧牲精神，則正可有機乘之，否則儘可多利用右路可也。何况有李義臣之中鋒，對方威費必甚，收效可望。　論我貢獻中葡盃之陣容，中華隊應爲：</p>

<p>（七）罰球投籃法</p>
<p>近年來全美國各學校，在良好敎練指導之下，利用星期，作短時間訓練罰球投籃之舉，其成績之驚異，可說對籃球運動，迅速提高水準，因之投罰球之獲得分數之精神，亦堪使人注意。在許多比賽中，其獲得與失敗，常視罰球之準確與吾而定。聞有一塲比賽，雙方均無取得，但其中一隊，因最後罰中一球而奠定勝局，此或均虛傳，但可見罰球之爲人所注重也。</p>
<p>投罰球雖屬比較輕而易舉之事，但在比賽緊張情緒激動之下，對平時缺少練習之球員，不無影饗其準確性；即平時勤於練習之球員，亦甚少見其在比賽中，能投十次中七决以上；美國春田大學，籃球實習一課，罰球投十决不中七次者，亦不許其合格，實爲我滬上球員，不可不求達到此水準也。</p>
<p>最簡便之罰球法，爲雙手低投法；此法係用兩手手指儘量張開握球之兩邊，（手心不觸球），握球要穩而輕便，兩足分開平立，如用胸前推舉投法，則兩足前後分立，投球身體先下蹲，屈膝，兩肘靠身邊下垂，身體重心宜正直，不失之太前或太後，球送出時，身體隨之而起，但不可跳起，亦不可向前斜衝出，兩且注視籃之鐵圈；球出之路綫、由高而下，以不觸籃板爲妙，但間有觸板比不觸板爲易者，可聽其便；凡已習慣甚有把握之罰球投法，不可謬然更改，否則採用新法，更不準確，其應改過之點，不過其常外投不中之錯誤處而矣。</p>
<p>（八）投籃常識及秘訣</p>
<p>訓練投籃技術，有種種不同方式，可因指導員之興趣與經騐而異，但是論採用何種方式，除技術實習訓練之外，對於投籃常識與秘訣，亦應使每一球員熟知；技術須用相當時間訓練，但常識與秘訣，一說即可明瞭，可糾正諸多錯誤，正可說費時省，收效大也，茲將其主要者分述如下：</p>

<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India previously took the opportunity of visiting Japan to decide with the Japanese government to mutually dispatch diplomatic representatives, in order to enhance the cooperative relationship between the two countries, to complete the Greater East Asia War and to achieve Indian independence. Subsequently, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu carefully weighed the candidates, and as a result, decided to appoint Teruo Hachiya, the Foreign Affairs Department Chief of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and Investigation Officer of the Foreign Ministry, as the first minister. Therefore, the Japanese and Indian governments have established formal diplomatic relations, which is of great significance for India's independence movement. Consequently, both countries should further strengthen the war, strive to defeat the common enemies of Britain and the United States, and seek the liberation of India. After the Japanese government assisted in the formation of the Provisional Government of Free India on October 21st of last year, it immediately recognized it and declared that it would return the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of Free India. Afterwards, it further strengthened the Indian National Army, assisting the Japanese army in fighting fiercely in various border areas of India and Burma, demonstrating considerable achievements. On the one hand, it also gradually mobilized and gathered three million Indians in various parts of East Asia. The foundation of the provisional government, whether politically or militarily, has also developed to a considerable stage. Therefore, the appointment of Minister Hachiya is a clear sign of the Japanese government's strengthening of support for achieving Indian independence. The relationship between the two countries is becoming increasingly close, so its significance is truly significant.</p>

<h3 id="e7">歲暮反省 <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The end of the 33rd year of the Republic of China is today.</p>
<p>Another year is about to pass. What have we actually done this year?</p>
<p>The late Chairman Wang, in his New Year's Day address this year, instructed us that this year should be devoted to the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" for further efforts. How have we actually strived? What achievements have we made? Or is it worse than before?</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen, in his New Year's Day address to the citizens of Shanghai, pointed out that Shanghai has one abnormal thing and one contradictory thing. The abnormal thing is that the normal income of the general public is not enough to make a living, leading to shaky discipline and social unrest. The contradictory thing is that production should increase, but it decreases due to a lack of fuel, and hoarding raw materials for profit makes people lazy to produce, so the front cannot receive sufficient supplies, and the rear cannot have a proper life. These situations are actually not unique to Shanghai; many places are similar. Have we overcome these abnormal and contradictory things this year? How much have we overcome? Or is the degree deeper?</p>
<p>The New Year's editorial of this newspaper also put forward three hopes for this year: first, "hope for political clarity," second, "hope for relieving the suffering of the people," and third, "hope for fulfilling the task of participating in the war." How many of our hopes have been realized in a year? Or is the disappointment even greater?</p>
<p>The "purifying thought" that the late Chairman Wang instructed and the "political clarity" that we hope for are inseparable. Only by "purifying thought" can we make "political clarity," and only clear politics can purify thought. The late Chairman Wang also instructed us on "purifying thought": "All things that can hinder the uplift of the will to fight the decisive battle and discourage the revitalization of the national spirit must be eradicated and cleared away," such as "corruption and selling of office, which are malignant bacteria that corrode politics; hoarding and speculation, which are pests that poison people's lives; extortion and blackmail, which are the root of disorder in society; and decadence and debauchery, which are toxins that weaken the race." Corruption and selling of office are malignant bacteria that corrode politics. Sadly, corruption and selling of office cases this year, from the Hou Hu Gu Zhou major corruption case, the Shanghai special tax major fraud case, and the rice administration committee staff fraud case, have emerged one after another. How can politics be clear? Hoarding and speculation and extortion and blackmail, in fact, large-scale hoarding and speculation this year, manipulating materials, and inciting price increases have become more rampant than last year, and many have special forces as their background; non-political power or gun barrels as backing for extortion and blackmail incidents are even more rampant everywhere this year. Not to mention the most common ones, you will inevitably suffer or witness these kinds of events if you go out, at the docks, at the stations, in vehicles, and even on the road. If you are carrying anything, then you have even more chances of being blackmailed. In such a smoky atmosphere, it is inevitable that the decadent and debauched life, which is enough to weaken the race, will become more and more out of shape.</p>
<p>Since thought cannot be purified in this way, and political discipline and social atmosphere have become so corrupt, and even getting worse, how can we still complete "ensuring security" and "increasing production"? And how can we still realize our hoped-for "relieving the suffering of the people" and "fulfilling the task of participating in the war"?</p>
<p>Now, not only have bandits not been eradicated in various places, but there are also reports everywhere of extortion and blackmail incidents with political backgrounds and gun barrels as backing, making it even more difficult to ensure security and making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. Also, we are a country participating in the war. Currently, even the rear security in many places still needs to be maintained by allied forces, which is really too shameful.</p>
<p>Regarding production, due to the fact that political discipline has not yet been sound and security has not been ensured, various economic policies and control measures have not been properly implemented; material procurement countermeasures and supporting measures have also not been able to be made reasonable, which has naturally greatly affected production increases. This year's decline in various production industries has undoubtedly reached a very serious point.</p>
<p>Regarding the people's livelihood issue, the vast majority of our people are constantly affected by poor security, the blow of extortion and blackmail, and the devastation of high prices. Their lives have indeed become so difficult that they cannot be sustained. The abnormal phenomenon that Acting Chairman Chen said of "the normal income of the general public is not enough to make a living" has now almost become the most common thing. The so-called "people have no means of living" is probably no more tragic than it is now. With the people on their last breath, how can we still talk about fulfilling the task of participating in the war?</p>
<p>We must make a thorough reflection on all of the above at the end of the year today. From tomorrow onwards, both the government and the people must work hard to change. If we continue to make empty promises and act perfunctorily, then the future will be unimaginable.</p>

<p>— Meng Zhou</p>
<p>To suppress and stabilize prices, it is necessary to manage materials. This is a common cry of those with knowledge. However, in order to suppress and stabilize prices and manage materials, it is first necessary to stipulate complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods, and then it can be implemented earnestly based on the methods. For example, land transportation must first open up roads, and then it can follow the roads and move forward without going astray. Now, regarding the management methods of prices and materials, although various laws and regulations have been formulated, they are still rough and have many omissions. For example, when registering inventory, it should also clearly define detailed methods such as how to store, how to distribute, and how to price, so that the competent authorities can have a basis for implementation. If detailed methods are not defined in advance, and measures are taken to deal with the problems when they arise, then arbitrary measures will inevitably be taken and many malpractices will occur. Therefore, incomplete methods are like having no road. In places where there is no road, driving vehicles will inevitably overturn. Also, regarding prices and materials, even if detailed methods have been set, if the methods are not proper and difficult to implement, then these methods are like rugged, uneven, and blocked roads. Vehicles will definitely not be able to drive on the road, and the result will inevitably be abandoned and unused. As a result of this situation, the established methods will become a mere formality. Therefore, in order to achieve the purpose of managing materials and suppressing prices, the first step should be to stipulate complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods.</p>
<p>Having complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods, but not having a competent agency with centralized power and unified functions to implement them, these methods will not be effective. The agency is like a vehicle. If the vehicle is decayed and unsuitable for practical use, then even if the road is flat and can be reached directly, it will not be possible to drive. Now, regarding the management of prices and materials, the various public groups, government offices, and military camps in the local area often compete with each other and shirk responsibilities to each other. This is all because the group authority of various agencies has not been stipulated in detail. If it is possible to clearly define that price management is the sole responsibility of agency A, that rationing is the sole responsibility of agency B, and that the suppression of hoarding is the full responsibility of agency C, then between each other, the authority is clearly defined, and the responsibilities are clear, so the malpractices of competing and shirking responsibilities can naturally be eliminated. Also, military and police agencies have no competent authority for prices and materials in name, but in practice, because the military and police have real power and indeed have the necessary military needs and security, they cannot avoid excessive assistance in matters related to prices and materials. Therefore, events where names and realities do not match often occur. If the government cannot make the competent agency have the strength to implement, and at the same time, it is difficult to limit the participation of the military and police, then it may as well take into account the facts and clearly stipulate that a certain area and a certain period are limited, and the military and police are responsible for the competent authority over a certain matter, so that the power and responsibility are clearly defined, the name and reality are unified, and the merits and demerits will not be unaccountable. Therefore, the second step in suppressing prices and managing materials should be to establish a competent agency with centralized power and unified names and realities.</p>
<p>Regarding the management methods of prices and materials, to make them complete, proper, practical, and easy to implement, regarding the organizational authority of the competent agency, to make it have centralized power and unified names and realities, these are all matters that should be stipulated by laws and regulations. Therefore, the formulation of good laws and regulations is most important for suppressing prices and managing materials. However, with good laws and regulations, there must also be personnel who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law to assume the implementation, so that the duties of the laws and regulations can achieve their purpose. It is the same as having someone drive after the road is completed and the vehicle is equipped. However, as long as the personnel who assume the duty of implementing the laws and regulations can be devoted to their duties and abide by the law, they can also be competent, and it is not necessary for them to be geniuses with extraordinary abilities. Those who claim to be geniuses with extraordinary abilities often do not want to adhere to the scope and instead destroy the laws and regulations. In fact, if a certain law or regulation is difficult to implement, you can ask to modify it, but before it is changed, you must strictly abide by it and not allow contempt. If a certain law or regulation is not yet complete, you can also interpret the law and then formulate methods and ask the superior to approve it as a precedent for reference. You are not allowed to arbitrarily assert your own opinions and hastily change the precedent. In short, destroying laws and regulations and arbitrarily changing precedents are all convenient for malpractice and become a source of corruption. Therefore, the third step in suppressing prices and managing materials should be to select personnel who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law and make them assume the duties of implementation.</p>
<p>The above three steps are equally important. Chinese people have always advocated rule by man and do not talk about the rule of law. They do not pay attention to the formulation of laws and regulations. After the laws and regulations are formulated, they are regarded as their writing and forgotten over time. In this situation, to put politics into a regular path is really going in the opposite direction. Therefore, strictly enforcing laws and regulations is the prerequisite problem for suppressing prices and must be paid attention to. As for the personnel who assume the duties of implementation, it is not an easy task to make them all devoted to their duties and abide by the law. If they are not thrifty and hardworking, they cannot be devoted to their duties. If they have not read the laws and regulations thoroughly, they will not know how to abide by the law. Therefore, government offices and public groups must select thrifty, hardworking, and well-read people to assume duties in order to eliminate malpractices and create a clean atmosphere. Like some people who are good at using people, the authorities prefer to regard flashy and active people as outstanding talents and do not favor thrifty, hardworking, and well-read people. As the trend goes, being devoted to their duties and abiding by the law is considered out of touch with the times and becomes extremely rare.</p>
<p>Written on December 29th, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, for the seventh day after the death of Chairman Wang, coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the Yan telegram</p>
<p>I wrote a Jinlvqu poem to mourn him, because Chairman Wang liked this tune, Wu Hufan</p>
<p>Urge me to support the sky, then boundless bleak travel, people worry, double illuminate tear marks still wet today, after experiencing wind and rain jealousy, hate only hate the treacherous spear secretly injected, a thought of heartache to save the raging waves, fighting to eliminate soldiers to relieve the calamity first, meritorious service in the country, fixed discussion. Open up ten thousand feelings and a thousand difficulties, a hero's courage, a bodhisattva's heart, when will the wounds all over the land be restored? Heaven does not leave Yuan Fu, regretting not seeing the full peace, one sleep buried in the ground, accompanying the heroic spirit under the setting sun Mei Hua Wu, prison reflection, filial mausoleum tree.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (German News Agency telegram) - German News Agency: German Aviation Minister General Goering recently issued a New Year's message to the German people, urging them to fight hard and reiterating his belief in victory. He said, "We have overcome the difficulties of the past many years and have made the greatest sacrifices. Our honorable army has defeated the enemy on the borders of Greater Germany. We follow the Fuhrer's will, and everything is for the front line. New weapons have increased the burden on the enemy. If the Germans show weakness, then there are precedents for the countries that have stopped fighting. The enemy promises to give these countries freedom, but in reality, they give them civil war, turmoil, disaster, and famine. Therefore, the chaos in Europe today is unprecedented in history. If the enemy invades German soil, where will the Germans go? Therefore, our New Year's task is to avoid the enemy's invasion and at the same time invade enemy territory. The enemy has united to force us to fight. We will never lay down our weapons until we have obtained a guarantee of freedom. Although the coming year will certainly be difficult, we also know that the Germans will win under the leadership of Fuhrer Hitler. Our New Year's motto is that whether attacking or defending, we must fight with the spirit of the Germans."</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Havas telegram) - Havas telegram: The battle in southern Belgium and Luxembourg has entered a new stage. The anti-Axis forces are increasing the pressure on the German flank, and the German army is also increasing reinforcements to prevent their advance. There is fierce fighting north and northwest of Laroche, and west of Stavelot. Eisenhower has apparently transferred most of the tank corps of the US Ninth Army to that location. It is currently difficult to predict whether the British troops under Montgomery will also be transferred to that location. Although the enemy's pressure is great, there is no significant change in the German flank. The American attack on the German vanguard west of Rochefort was repelled. The American troops that broke into Bastogne are now continuing to advance north. There is fierce fighting on the line east from south of Witz to the crossing point at Echternach, but the enemy has not made much progress.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to reports, fierce fighting continues in southern Belgium and Luxembourg. The US military, out of its total of 44 divisions, has specially dispatched the 26th Division to the north, charging sideways on the flanks of the German vanguard troops, so that the German troops are isolated. Marshal Rundstedt has increased his forces near Menenwa to prepare for a second offensive.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency: Budapest continues to hold, resisting the Red Army's advance. The battles near Lake Balaton in the west and the southern border of Slovakia are also intense. The current battle line starts from the northern end of Lake Balaton and extends northward, ending in the Gran area. The German-Hungarian allied forces are retreating westward, having crossed the Gran River without losses along the way. At present, the plain north of the Danube River is being fought over, and new developments are expected in the fighting there. In the coming days, western Hungary will be the focus of the war. Soviet forces in the Gran area are currently using heavy tanks, making slight breakthroughs on the Mi-Tao-Fonburg line, but they are quickly contained. The third major battle in the Mi-Tao area has likely passed its peak and is gradually weakening.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - New York News: U.S. journalist Pearson published an article in the "Daily Victory Report" on the 28th, explaining the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the U.S. military to use Soviet bases. The gist of it is as follows: The Soviet government has notified the U.S. government that it will henceforth prohibit U.S. military aircraft from landing on Soviet territory. Therefore, the U.S. Air Force's previous use of Soviet airfields to carry out bombings can no longer continue. Germany has moved some military supply factories to the occupied territories of Poland. If the U.S. military cannot use Soviet airfields to carry out bombings, the German military will be able to fully supply its counter-offensive operations in Belgium. The Soviet Union has long harbored a distrust of the capitalist world, and its renewed policy of prohibiting aircraft from anti-Axis countries from passing through Soviet territory is particularly puzzling. U.S. Army Air Forces Chief of Staff Eaker stated to a group of reporters on September 15th that the U.S. and Soviet governments had reached a consensus that bombing from Soviet bases would not continue due to extreme cold and other climatic reasons, and because the main bombing targets in the Balkan countries were occupied by the anti-Axis forces. This matter reveals a glimpse of discord among the anti-Axis nations.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Household Rice Delivery Delayed, Allocation in Early January <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>This period's household ration rice has been announced for sale by the Goods Allocation Office, with each certificate allowing the purchase of 1.5 liters of rice at a price of 97.5 National currency. There are slight differences in quantity and price compared to the previous period, leading to many questions from the outside world. Director Feng You of the office expressed the following views:</p>
<p>The allocation of household rice in the old Food Bureau's jurisdiction ended on the 29th of this month. The office has announced the start of allocation from the 30th. The reason why the quantity of household rice for the old 18th and 2nd districts in this period has been reduced from two liters to 1.5 liters is because the purchasing agencies have recently acquired miscellaneous grains for supplementary allocation in order to encourage wartime living. Therefore, relevant parties have agreed to reduce the rice allocation by half a liter this period and additionally allocate one catty of miscellaneous grains (beans), which is equivalent to more than half a liter of rice. Therefore, in fact, the allocation quantity is still maintained at two liters. Although the announcement of the allocation of one catty of miscellaneous grains was not issued at the same time as the rice allocation announcement due to delivery issues, the allocation will be implemented in early January. In short, the reason for reducing the allocation by half a liter this period is to supplement it with miscellaneous grains, and it is not a permanent change to 1.5 liters. If there is no need to supplement miscellaneous grains next time, the allocation of two liters will be restored. As for the price of rice allocation this time, it has also been slightly increased, with each liter selling for 65 yuan. The reason for this is that the procurement and transportation costs of the procurement agencies in other places have increased due to the impact of other commodity prices. Therefore, the allocation price of this office has also had to be slightly increased. In short, this office is well aware that citizens are currently suffering greatly from the soaring black market price of rice. This office will do its best to maintain the current price of 65 yuan per liter, that is, 6,500 yuan per picul, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. The city government is also trying to raise funds to continue borrowing or allocate funds from the reorganization of tax revenues for subsidies, so that the allocation price can be continued to maintain, so that the general public can obtain affordable food.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Feelings on the Nurses' Enthusiastic Aid to Education, Hoping that the Whole Society Will Mobilize Fundraising <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The letter from the Hong En Hospital nurses' team, which was published in yesterday's newspaper, must have resonated with readers. The nursing profession is still in its infancy in China, while it has long been recognized as the most sacred free profession for women in various countries around the world. Regardless of which woman has received considerable training at school and serves society or becomes a housewife after graduation, she must have rich nursing knowledge. As for those who specialize in nursing, they serve patients all day long, without fear of hard work or hardship. Patients on groaning beds then feel "having illness makes you know how healthy you were". In addition to doctors being their saviors, nurses are their good companions. Therefore, every move and every word of the nurse is most noticed by the patient, and "heroes are most afraid of the devil of disease". Anyone who gets sick is particularly compassionate and particularly enthusiastic. If the nurse takes this opportunity to persuade with the "Aid to Education Movement", the effect will be very great. In addition to thanking the nurses of "Hong En", this newspaper also hopes that the nurses of major hospitals in Shanghai will respond in unison and take the lead in using "Aid to Education" as the only thorough way to save the country and the people, and persuade patients to donate. The thousands of poor and out-of-school children in Shanghai will be grateful and moved to tears, without a doubt.</p>
<p>In recent days, all sectors of Shanghai society have enthusiastically supported the aid to education movement, and the achievements of "special fundraising" are improving day by day, which makes us extremely excited. Since all sectors of society have responded in unison and resonated, we feel that there is still hope for people's hearts, there is still hope for public welfare undertakings, and further: the future of the country is promising! We hope that like-minded readers will join hands and work together to advance towards the goal of the aid to education movement!</p>

We have handled the third joint insurance baojia in the former Central District, now Huangpu District, for three years. At the beginning of our tenure, we adhered to the principle of working hard without complaint, being honest and self-disciplined, not disturbing the people, and seeking peace. We spent a lot of effort and painstaking efforts on the payment of fees. Over the years, the company and individuals have paid a lot. Now we are happy to meet with a change of personnel. We are deeply ashamed of our shortcomings and are fortunate to have avoided the path of the worthy, and we are quite relieved that we have been told that we are innocent of our crimes. And thereafter, due to the reduction of expenses on baojia, the company and individuals have reduced their burden, and we have specifically transferred the miscellaneous expenses prepared for baojia to aid education. We have identified three teams, named Zhongying Pharmacy Team, Huangpu District Baojia Committee Zhu Ruichen's Retired Team, Huangpu District Third Joint Insurance Zou Xiashen's Retired Team, and now we send 60,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates (20,000 yuan per team).

Taking office and retiring are common occurrences for civil servants. Donating to aid education will leave a lasting memory and is worthy of emulation. Mr. Yang Xingdi was the director of Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. His unfortunate death is a great loss to the dyeing and weaving industry. His friends and relatives formed a memorial service and collected 520,000 yuan in condolences, which were all distributed to various charities. Such a righteous act is immeasurable. The wireless manufacturers saved their dinner party fees and used them to aid education, saving expenses and helping out-of-school children. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The students of the Second Academy of Datong University Affiliated High School worked together to raise funds. The China Advertising Company's aid to education team, the anonymous team, and the oil and grain team, the Lianrangtang Children's Team, and the Tongli Team all donated one after another, expressing their thanks.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Forty Days Adrift at Sea <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the fierce battles of the Mariana Islands, four brave warriors – Petty Officer First Class Sesaki of the Navy, Seaman Tatsuwo Kanakawa, Crewman Masao Tani, and Kokufu Sakoda – escaped from Omiya Island. After drifting at sea for forty days and navigating over a thousand miles, they finally returned safely. These four men belonged to the Meteorological Unit and were crew members of the Asahi Maru (240 tons). They had no direct affiliation with the Omiya Island garrison but happened to pass by the island when the enemy attacked, thus becoming embroiled in the conflict. Later, under orders from their superior officer, they escaped the island, broke through the encirclement of enemy warships and aircraft, and miraculously survived after enduring numerous hardships. The following is a summary of their ordeal as recounted by Sesaki and Kanakawa:</p>
<p>Discovery of Enemy Warships</p>
<p>Petty Officer First Class Hinzaki and his comrades were aboard the Second Asahi Maru, which was ordered to return to the mainland via Omiya Island for hull repairs. This occurred in early June. On the eleventh of the same month, while sailing near Omiya Island, they observed twenty friendly aircraft urgently flying towards Saipan, sensing that something was amiss. That night, they spotted flares from enemy warships, indicating a chaotic situation at sea, and they became certain of an enemy task force attack.</p>
<p>The next day (June 12), before dawn, they anchored two nautical miles off the coast of Showa Street on Omiya Island, as planned. At that moment, enemy carrier-based aircraft were conducting an aerial assault. The dim sky was filled with enemy planes, and ships in the harbor and ground troops fiercely resisted them. Soon, the Asahi Maru was strafed by three Grumman fighter planes. They immediately fought back but were forced to go ashore due to a fire. After landing, they promptly proceeded to the headquarters to report the battle situation and movements. To prepare for a potential enemy landing on Omiya Island, a landing force was immediately formed. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki was assigned to a unit commanded by a certain Lieutenant, with Sesaki serving as the unit leader.</p>
<p>From June 16, the enemy's bombing intensified, with each raid involving over two hundred aircraft and daily totals exceeding a thousand. Moreover, from that day on, enemy warships approached the island and began naval bombardment. At that time, among the modern American warships arrogantly sailing before their eyes, the third one (40,000 tons class) suddenly exploded, sending up a huge column of fire, and then sank. This was the result of a surprise attack by their submarine. Upon witnessing this, they couldn't help but shout "Banzai!" From this day until July 7, the enemy's naval and air attacks were incessant. The coastal defense positions were completely destroyed by concentrated naval gunfire, and the naval forces were forced to establish defenses along the Moga Mountain area. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki's unit retreated to the Hakoeya River.</p>
<p>Fighting Back Against the Enemy</p>
<p>By July 19, the enemy's attempts to land became more urgent, with aircraft carriers and battleships approaching the coast to launch a fierce assault. Through binoculars, they could see American artillerymen rolling up their sleeves, smoking cigarettes, and leisurely firing their guns, which infuriated them.</p>
<p>Soon, the enemy used fifty amphibious tanks as the vanguard and landed about 50,000 soldiers in the Showa Street area. The army and navy garrison forces immediately fought back, inflicting 15,000 casualties on the enemy. However, their losses were also significant, forcing them to retreat to a new defensive line in Orita Village. At this time, the enemy dispatched follow-up troops to invade Hokuto Cape.</p>
<p>From then until July 22, the battle situation can be summarized as follows: the enemy's firepower was superior, and despite the bravery of their garrison forces, they could not reverse the situation and had to gradually retreat. Finally, the time for a general offensive arrived. By August 7, their forces were isolated by enemy tank units, but the morale of the entire army was further heightened, vowing to fight to the end.</p>
<p>Sesaki First Class Petty Officer's company, in order to carry out its mission, broke through the enemy encirclement and moved towards Shirahama beach. The squads dispersed, carrying transmitters and receivers, and infiltrated the thick forest. From that time onwards, the islanders' espionage activities became rampant, and their movements were often reported to the enemy. Enemy aircraft frequently cut off their engines and glided over the forest, communicating with ships at sea and continuously carrying out concentrated artillery fire and bombing. Enemy tanks roamed freely, using flame throwers to set the forest on fire, and densely strung electric wires on the roads. Anyone who accidentally touched them would be subjected to a concentrated attack. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki and others overcame these obstacles and continued to advance. On the dawn of August 9, they discovered an enemy tank on the road. They crept up to it stealthily, and the American soldiers were still fast asleep inside. They immediately used several hand grenades to destroy it and then continued to advance towards Shirahama Village. Unexpectedly, the enemy had also reached the village, forcing them to slip into a cave on the coast to await their opportunity. They gathered and counted the number of personnel: a total of twenty-four, including the company commander. The unit leader was already dead.</p>
<p>On August 15, the company commander, realizing that the battle on the island was very serious, decided to recruit a suicide squad to send liaison officers to the mainland. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki and three others immediately volunteered, willing to face death to complete this task. After searching, they finally found two Type 95 folding river-crossing boats in the jungle. They immediately repaired one of them, built oars, erected a mast, and loaded it with three bushels of unpolished rice, one hundred coconuts, a drum of rainwater, and some dry bread. The boat was made of 1.5mm thick plywood, fifteen feet long and five feet wide.</p>
<p>On the night of August 20, Sesaki and his comrades received the following orders:</p>
<p>"By this order, Petty Officer First Class Zhaqi and other four persons are to take off from the Omiya Island by a ferry craft from Shirahama coast on August 20. May you have a long-lasting martial luck. Commander of the landing force of the 000th unit, Navy Second Lieutenant So and So."</p>
<p>Escape in the Dark of Night</p>
<p>Earlier, on the night of the 19th, the enemy task force near Lotai seemed to be moving, and enemy surveillance at sea was very strict. Therefore, Sesaki's departure had to be delayed by one day, and he finally had a chance to leave the island at 7:00 p.m. on the 21st. Under the strict surveillance of the enemy's sea and land forces, the four quietly left the island, but they were immediately discovered by an enemy patrol boat and subjected to gunfire. Fortunately, they skillfully used the darkness to escape the danger. However, the shoulders and abdomen of crewmen Tani and Sakoda were finally hit. Due to the enemy's strict surveillance, the small boat lingered between Lotai and Omiya Island for three days. On the fourth day, the wounded recovered some strength and finally managed to slip past the警戒Line. Relying on a watch-style compass, a nautical chart torn from the naval diary, and the stars in the sky, they sailed at sea for thirteen days. During this period, enemy aircraft frequently flew by, and the island of Omiya Hall remained visible in the distance. At night, they vaguely saw the lights flashing from what seemed to be the Akashi Street airfield, and the thought that the enemy was rushing to repair the airfield filled their hearts with indescribable anger.</p>
<p>On September 6, they finally lost sight of Omiya Island. Later, fresh water gradually became scarce. On September 21, they finally spotted the silhouette of birds, guessing that they had reached the vicinity of Taiwan or the Ryukyu Islands. Unexpectedly, a storm suddenly arose on the 23rd, and the small boat was swept away by a gale with a speed of thirty meters per second, drifting uncontrollably for three days and three nights. The weather finally cleared on the morning of the fourth day. At this time, a considerable amount of fresh water had accumulated in the bucket, their spirits had recovered, and they knew that the small boat had caught the expected Kuroshio Current. On the morning of the fifth day, they raised the sail again and took a northwesterly course. The small boat sped along with the wind, white foam forming in its wake, and schools of sardines chased after the boat. Just as they were worrying about running out of food, they saw these fish, and they looked at each other with great joy. They immediately made a net out of gauze and caught forty or fifty of them, swallowing them alive.</p>
<p>Friendly Aircraft Come to Help</p>
<p>After sailing at sea for another week, they spotted seven friendly aircraft, having only seen enemy aircraft in the past. Therefore, everyone was very excited. Chief Seaman Kanakawa was a signalman. He immediately sent out a distress signal. However, the friendly aircraft had other important missions and did not rescue them. One plane dropped a bag of food and then flew away hastily. However, having encountered friendly aircraft, they felt much more courageous. Moreover, they saw seaweed and wood chips floating by, and everyone was excited that they were approaching land.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 30, they discovered three islands. At noon, they reached the islands and were rescued by Chinese fishermen. It turned out to be an island near the Zhoushan Islands off the coast of Shanghai. Before reaching the islands, they had been without food for two weeks, drinking only seawater three times a day. After resting on the islands for three days, they made contact with the naval garrison. On October 9, they arrived in Shanghai, returned to their local unit, and reported everything.

<h3 id="e35">Candy <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Qianli</p>
<p>The junior high classroom of Lianhua Girls' Primary School was in an uproar.</p>
<p>It was exam day, and they were testing geometry.</p>
<p>But it didn't look like the ten minutes before an exam at all.</p>
<p>As soon as Huang Mingfen entered the classroom in the morning, she told everyone in a loud voice: yesterday she saw Mr. He at Zhaofeng Park, with another person.</p>
<p>"Who?" everyone asked in unison, and anxiously.</p>
<p>"Guess!" the reporter deliberately kept them in suspense.</p>
<p>Of course, no one could guess. So Huang Mingfen shouted:</p>
<p>"It's Liu Shuzhen!"</p>
<p>Everyone knew Liu Shuzhen. She graduated this summer.</p>
<p>Many people didn't believe it, but Huang Mingfen swore that if she was wrong or spreading rumors, she wouldn't be human.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, ask He Guangsheng yourself later."</p>
<p>Class began, and Mr. He brought in the exam papers.</p>
<p>Everyone made some faces at each other, and finally Huang Mingfen said:</p>
<p>"Mr. He, we went to Zhaofeng Park yesterday, sat under the willow tree, and had a really happy chat!"</p>
<p>The classroom erupted in laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. He's face immediately turned red.</p>
<p>Mr. He often blushed. Mr. He was only twenty-three years old this year, and was still studying at the university, majoring in electrical engineering, and would graduate next year.</p>
<p>Before he could answer, everyone started shouting randomly.</p>
<p>"Was the chat really happy?"</p>
<p>"No wonder Liu Shuzhen hasn't been coming to the school to play much lately."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>No one was thinking about the exam.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone shouted:</p>
<p>"Treat us to candy!"</p>
<p>"Candy! Candy! Treat us to candy!" Everyone was eating and laughing.</p>
<p>"Let's take the exam today first!" Mr. He finally said, "We'll talk about it tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Afraid that the teacher would renege, everyone repeated it again when they finished the exam:</p>
<p>"Don't forget to bring candy tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Mr. He didn't forget. He really brought it the next day, but it wasn't candy, it was candied dates, two for each person.</p>
<p>So the classroom was filled with a happy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mr. He taught both geometry and chemistry.</p>
<p>Mr. He had a very calm mind. When proving geometric theorems and calculating chemical equations, he was really meticulous.</p>
<p>But this one thing, somehow, he got confused.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, he didn't even know how he suddenly sent that letter to Liu Shuzhen. He had even forgotten what he wrote in it. Thinking about it now, it seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>But others didn't take him for dreaming at all. A colleague met him at Liu Shuzhen's door, so he treated his colleagues to candy again. Several female teachers even congratulated him.</p>
<p>He was very satisfied with these things, and he was also very proud.</p>
<p>However, troubles finally came.</p>
<p>First, it was Liu Shuzhen who told him that her father knew about this matter, and seemed to have some complaints. Moreover, in between the lines, even her studies for the next semester were in question. The old-fashioned father defined it:</p>
<p>"There are no good male teachers in girls' schools."</p>
<p>Secondly, the principal of Lianhua asked him to have a talk. The principal told him that the matter between Mr. He and Liu Shuzhen had become a "public secret" among the students. Moreover, the principal himself had heard some public opinion from parents, which was very critical of the school. Especially in girls' schools, the school spirit was very important.</p>
<p>Finally, the principal, as an elder, advised him:</p>
<p>"So, I say, Mr. He, not that I'm trying to upset you, but it's best to be cautious about this kind of thing! It's not good for you. You're graduating from university next year, and you can't spend a lot of time on these things. Furthermore, it's not a good thing for the school either. Many parents know about it and are dissatisfied. If this continues, it will affect the increase in students!"</p>
<p>However, the students were very enthusiastic about this matter. Those girls kept asking the geometry teacher about the latest developments, stubbornly inquiring about some trivial little questions. For example, what Liu Shuzhen called him, what he wrote in the letter, what they talked about, whether they went to Zhaofeng Park every Sunday, and what would happen if they didn't go, etc.</p>
<p>The young teacher answered these questions in detail, even more detailed than he explained geometric theorems. For no reason, he just felt full of joy.</p>
<p>But finally, a parent wrote a letter to question the school authorities, asking very sternly whether the school could allow teachers to engage in such behavior? Had they thought about the impact on the students? Was a teacher allowed to do this?</p>
<p>The school authorities couldn't answer these questions.</p>
<p>So, the principal asked Mr. He to have a talk again.</p>
<p>Mr. He read the letter. He understood very clearly what he should do, and what the principal hoped he would do.</p>
<p>"I want to ask for a long leave," then he added, "I'm busy with my studies." As mentioned above, Mr. He would graduate from university next year.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's avoid the limelight first." The principal was very sympathetic.</p>
<p>Coming out of the principal's office, he was stopped by the junior high school students on the stairs. "We want candy too. Tong Xiujuan saw you at the entrance of the Great Light Gate yesterday... You must bring it tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Mr. He smiled at them. Was his face red?</p>
<h3 id="e36">Describing Myself <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Xu</p>
<p>Once, I discovered myself, in front of the mirror—this is not to say that I have never looked in the mirror before, it was due to my negligence and self-claimed busyness. It was a foolish guy, looking at his nose with his eyes, and looking at his heart with his nose, wearing a cultured look.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was silent. For a person like this, it is too lazy to talk about sadness.</p>
<p>If life is really a road, then I have walked a little more than half of it; I don't know what will happen to the remaining half, because I don't have firm self-confidence, so I can't help but feel lost. In fact, people like this rarely have any extravagant hopes for the future, and have great repentance for the past.</p>
<p>My grandfather, even if he didn't have anything immortal or notorious during his lifetime, he did work hard and put his family on his shoulders. After that, my father had good handwriting, but he didn't go out to work hard for life. As for me, I can't even write well, let alone run a business. Logically speaking, this is bound to be a great sadness; fortunately, I am so foolish, numb, and cowardly, so I am too lazy to think about it and be sad. In this way, it is inevitable to sigh for the snail on the wall, enduring hardships, crawling silently, carrying the hard shell of memory, when can it unload the excessive burden on its back—you martyrs.</p>
<p>Indeed, snails are unfortunate. From this point of view, I seem very smart; however, this is the greatest sorrow. Therefore, even the most forgetful and sad people will be sad.</p>
<p>I pay attention to myself again: my eyes, ears, nose, and even my mouth don't look like people of this era at all; I used to run wild in the countryside, so it is inevitable that I have a little earthy air, or this is the reason for my stupidity. I am not like politicians, merchants, scholars, or celebrities, and naturally not a poet. "Then what are you?" you may ask. Well, why don't you ask the skin worm clinging to the Sanggan River what it is doing in its thin shell, and what it is waiting for?</p>
<p>What answer can you get?</p>
<p>None, because it is stupid.</p>
<p>Because of this, I am silent.</p>
<p>Some people say: stupidity is unforgivable, but can I forgive myself? —Please tell me.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Review of the Second Issue of "Whirlwind" <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xin</p>
<p>In October, the inaugural issue of the comprehensive magazine "Whirlwind" appeared on the literary scene, bringing people a novel feeling. While this feeling was still in the minds of readers, the second issue of "Whirlwind" was published.</p>
<p>The second issue of "Whirlwind" is more focused on literary and artistic aspects in terms of content. The main body of the content consists of six novels, four essays, and four poems. In terms of serialization, in addition to Mao Yu's "Children's Affairs," Sun Lehong's "Night Hunting Record" has been added. The author still maintains that unique style, and every word and sentence holds the reader's heart. Although it is not finished yet, it makes people shudder and unable to breathe from the beginning.</p>
<p>What I want to particularly mention is Xu Yi's essay "Fishing." In terms of style, it is very close to Lu Fen's "Cousins of Meng Anqing." The author uses his lively brushstrokes to depict a familiar shadow for us. I have spoken elsewhere about other essays by the author, and I hope to read works like "Fishing" again.</p>
<p>The lively and vivid layout and the fresh and eye-catching solid blue cover are also very attractive. Compared to the price of two hundred yuan, it is not a loss. If there is anything else to ask for, it is to improve the content level and not let some insubstantial works waste paper. Also, let the admirers, in this year of expensive firewood and rice, be able to obtain something that can really enrich and satisfy their minds in addition to spending a sum of money.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Kingdom of Poetry <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ge</p>
<p>No laurel wreath,</p>
<p>No cane,</p>
<p>No throne and palace,</p>
<p>Oppose restraint and privilege,</p>
<p>Despise all "poets" in golden robes,</p>
<p>Absolutely deny the kingdom of poetry!</p>
<p>We want to sing out cries,</p>
<p>We want to turn poems into</p>
<p>Human trumpets,</p>
<p>To issue strong love and hate</p>
<p>From humble blood and tears,</p>
<p>Turn sparks into prairie fire,</p>
<p>Tear down the kingdom of poetry!</p>
<h3 id="e39">Tower <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wen</p>
<p>The tower is the sword of a traitor,</p>
<p>Its sharp point piercing straight at the heart of the sky.</p>
<p>Its entire body covered with exquisite holes,</p>
<p>Within the holes once flashed</p>
<p>The charming image of an ancient royal concubine.</p>
<p>One day, suddenly, because of a miraculous story,</p>
<p>The tower became feared and revered by people;</p>
<p>Now it is covered with vines and dreams;</p>
<p>No longer do adventurous teenagers dare to climb it.</p>
<p>It was a monarch of a distant dynasty,</p>
<p>To praise his own dignity and merits,</p>
<p>Who conscripted thousands upon thousands of laborers,</p>
<p>Using their blood and flesh to build the tower's foundation.</p>
<p>Or it was devout monks,</p>
<p>To commemorate the greatness of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Thus, in the name of heaven,</p>
<p>They solicited donations from pious men and women from all over the world:</p>
<p>The history of the past is gradually forgotten,</p>
<p>And the tower becomes a mystery.</p>
<p>Now it stands isolated on a mountain peak,</p>
<p>Merely for the mourning of later generations,</p>
<p>People only exclaim in admiration at its magnificence.</p>
<p>And dream of the legendary demon within the tower.</p>
<p>Time passes year after year,</p>
<p>Green vines wither and then turn verdant again,</p>
<p>Sometimes, exactly during the sunny and harmonious vernal equinox,</p>
<p>The area around the tower is filled with admiring visitors;</p>
<p>Sometimes, when a mountain fire starts below,</p>
<p>The tower sinks into incomparable loneliness,</p>
<p>Although it harbors an incomprehensible sorrow,</p>
<p>It remains silent,</p>
<p>With a wait.</p>
<p>One evening, an old man came,</p>
<p>(I have heard the elders of this tower say)</p>
<p>He is a villager who has been wandering abroad for many years,</p>
<p>Now, he has returned in decline,</p>
<p>Bringing with him a body full of fatigue,</p>
<p>He gropes his way close to the tower.</p>
<p>Wanting to use his dim old eyes,</p>
<p>To find the scars of his youth;</p>
<p>He murmurs his sorrows,</p>
<p>And the silent tower also begins to groan.</p>
<p>Thus, in a deep,</p>
<p>Deep midnight,</p>
<p>The tower emits a mutual roar,</p>
<p>Ending its life together with him.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shen Bao Cup Basketball League's Completion of Merit and Virtue for Gongde Nationals <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League's Group B finals and women's group matches, which began last Wednesday (the 20th), have concluded after fierce competition. In Group B, the Shantou team overcame strong opponents one after another, and in the final, they narrowly defeated Ren Yu by one point to win the overall championship, a truly commendable achievement. The Green team, with its outstanding performance, easily won every match and secured the Shen Bao Cup women's group title. The Green team's dominance among women is a source of pride. The cup awards ceremony was held this Friday and presided over by Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper. The Group A winners, Zhongbei and Hualian, each received a silver cup, accepted by team captain Wang Zhongtao for Zhongbei and team captain Kong Guangyi for Hualian. The Shantou team's champion trophy in Group B was accepted by its key player, Lin Zuoshi. Green team captain Li Zhi was absent, so vice-captain Huang Mingyuan accepted the silver cup. Thus, the Shen Bao Cup came to a successful and virtuous conclusion. This newspaper would like to express its deep gratitude for the assistance received from all parties in organizing this basketball league. It fulfilled its original intention of promoting basketball and generated considerable revenue from ticket sales, which will greatly benefit the scholarship fund. The league began on October 6th and has now concluded successfully after nearly three months.</p>
<p>Shantou Team Wins Group B Championship</p>
<p>The Group B finals adopted a knockout system. Each of the five matches featured excellent performances and intense competition, said to be on par with Group A, which is not an exaggeration. The final match between Shantou and Ren Yu was particularly fierce, with both teams giving their all. In the end, Shantou narrowly won by a score of 25 to 24.</p>
<p>The two teams were evenly matched, with many seasoned veterans on their rosters. Their tactics were comparable to those of Group A teams and were progressing on the right track. Today's strong Group B teams will become tomorrow's Group A teams, aiming to dominate Shanghai, and this will be their starting point. We encourage all young players to continue their efforts with this spirit and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Green Team Completes Dominance in Women's Group</p>
<p>Five teams joined the women's group. Except for the Green team, which was particularly outstanding, the other teams were closely matched. The women's matches were unique. Here's a brief introduction to the champion Green team's performance, starting with their results in the cup competition:</p>
<p>Green Team defeats Xuebai 48-15</p>
<p>Green Team defeats Sansheng 50-11</p>
<p>Green Team defeats Huadong 62-15</p>
<p>Green Team defeats Yikang 38-14</p>
<p>Given the Green team's high winning margins in each match, they deserve their title as the leading women's team in Shanghai. Under the planning of manager Xie Yiqin, the team has been constantly practicing. Coach Qian Xucang has put in a lot of effort in guiding them. Team leader Xue Chunsheng has provided much encouragement. In these circumstances, they improve rapidly, so it is no wonder that newer teams have difficulty competing with them. Overall, the Green team's successful evasive maneuvers and accurate shooting are impressive. Individually, Huang Mingyuan and Rong Shujian are both in top form, while Yan Weiwen has a special style. Her dribbling skills have reached perfection, and with her talent for long shots, Miss Yan has become a standard center. As for the guards, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yinlan have reached the peak of their individual skills. In terms of tactics, the three adopt a man-to-man marking strategy, each fulfilling their duties, pressing tightly and relentlessly. Their clear understanding of the game makes it difficult for opponents to break through. The Green team's low scores against them are due to the efforts of these three. With such a strong lineup, it is no surprise that they were undefeated. Reserve players such as Yang Wenjuan and Zhu Chengran are also promising talents.</p>
<p>Excellent Performances by Emerging Female Players</p>
<p>Among the emerging teams, Yikang, Xuebai, and Huadong, comprised of young players, put on a good show. The players of the Yikang team followed the coach's instructions and rarely made mistakes. Their inability to win is due to their relative inexperience and slightly inferior individual skills. The Xuebai team showed significant progress in each match, which is attributed to the efforts of team leader Chen Hanquan and coach Zhang Juefei. In their final match against Sansheng, they even managed to draw, demonstrating their rapid progress. Forward Zhang Huiling's agility, Xiao Ying's versatility, and Sheng Jingshu's steadiness are all commendable. Their excellent coordination is particularly rare. The three guards, Zhang Xiuli and Huang Ruyu, are all lively and energetic, with unlimited potential for the future. The Huadong team mainly consists of students from Zhongli Women's High School. Talented players such as Xu Rui and Xiu are still in the initial stages of cooperation and inevitably lack cohesion. In short, all the new teams have shown great potential. It is hoped that they will continue to work hard, and their achievements can be expected. Keep up the good work! (Gong)</p>

<p>The Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, held a decade ago, always attracted huge crowds, a sight that still lingers in our minds. However, it has been suspended since the war. Now, the Football Association is reviving this cup match. Both China and Portugal have football stars who are sure to display their skills to the fullest. The crowds are also expected to be large. It is reported that the competition will still be a best-of-three series, with the first match scheduled for New Year's Day in the 34th year of the Republic. The Portuguese lineup has already been announced, and the Chinese roster has also been revealed. A total of 18 talented Chinese players have been selected. Since the Portuguese team's lineup is available, I would like to offer a lineup that counters it.</p>
<p>Portuguese Lineup Announced</p>
<p>Panlimi</p>
<p>Vicktai Colaituo</p>
<p>Laositan Aoliela Gelinbao</p>
<p>V Su Ruo W Panson Baoxiu Tuo Lailiao Fuen</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the Portuguese team's attack is entirely focused on the left. The right side will rely solely on Fuen, who is expected to display his power. If this is the case, then our Chinese left-back should be Tian Sheng or Li Ning. Fuen is strong, but the two Lis are too old and may not be able to stop him. Therefore, I believe that Wu Qixiang is the best choice for the left-back position. Old Wu is currently in excellent form and is the only one who can stop Fuen's rapid charge. Moreover, Qixiang is skilled with both feet and will be able to handle the task with ease. The authorities may have their reasons for wanting to use Tian Sheng or Li Ning, but from a tactical standpoint, I believe that Wu Qixiang should be preferred over the two Lis. Some may argue that if Qixiang is moved to the left, the right-back position will become a problem. However, we can avoid this by moving Zhang Lingen, who is a standard right-back. The reason he plays as a midfielder for the Donghua team is because of the lack of midfielders. However, Zhang's style has never been well-suited to the midfielder position, and he still resembles a defender. Therefore, it is only logical to use Lingen as the right-back. I hope the authorities will consider my suggestion. For the center-back position, I suggest Song Lingsheng as the central figure. Considering the Portuguese team's lineup, they will likely focus on defense and then look for opportunities to attack. Therefore, the Chinese team should adopt an attacking strategy. With Song's ball-handling skills, he can coordinate the attack from the center. The right midfielder position should be filled by Zheng Ying, who is currently in good form and improving his kicking and dribbling skills. His speed is also quite fast. As for the left midfielder, I believe Ying Fuzhen should be used. Some may argue that Old Ying has never played midfielder before, so why should we let him try now? But I say, why can't he give it a try? Song Lingsheng has never been successful as a left midfielder. Old Ying is good at retreating to become the third defender, making up for the deficiencies of the defense. Moreover, he can be used to man-mark Fuen, relying on his height to stifle Fuen's activity. I urge you not to dismiss Old Ying simply because he has never played midfielder before. Who knows, he may succeed after trying it out. Moreover, tactically, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>For the front line, I propose Li Yi as the center forward, Han Longhai as the right forward, Jia Youliang as the right winger, Sun Jinshun as the left forward, and Li Yao as the left winger. Indeed, the opponent has deployed a strategy to block Sun and Li's attacks and stop Youliang's activity. However, I believe that Youliang and Longhai can switch positions at any time to keep the opponent guessing. Moreover, in the match between Junhua and Portuguese merchants, Kaositan was unable to contain Youliang, and Viktor's mere bravery is not worth mentioning. Sun Jinshun will definitely be man-marked by Lailiao, and Li Yao will also be man-marked by Gelinbao. But if the opponent is willing to sacrifice themselves, then we can take advantage of it. Otherwise, we can make more use of the right side. Moreover, with Li Yichen as the center forward, the opponent's Weifei will be very wary, and the effect is promising. To sum up, my proposed lineup for the Sino-Portuguese Cup is as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Wu Zhang</p>
<p>Qi Lin</p>
<p>Xiang Gen</p>
<p>Tan Song Zheng</p>
<p>Fu Ling Ying</p>
<p>Zhen Sheng Quan</p>
<p>Li Zhuang Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Han Longhai Jia Youliang</p>

<p>(7) Free Throw Shooting Technique</p>
<p>In recent years, schools across the United States, under the guidance of good coaches, have been using weekends for short-term free throw shooting training, and the remarkable results have rapidly improved the level of basketball. Therefore, the importance of scoring through free throws is worth noting. In many games, victory or defeat often depends on the accuracy of free throws. It is said that in one game, neither side scored, but one team won the game by making a free throw at the end. This may be a rumor, but it shows the importance attached to free throws.</p>
<p>Although shooting free throws is relatively easy, in the tense and emotional atmosphere of a game, it can affect the accuracy of players who lack practice. Even players who practice diligently rarely make seven out of ten free throws in a game. At Springfield College in the United States, students who fail to make seven out of ten free throws in a basketball practice class are not allowed to pass, which is a standard that Shanghai players should strive to achieve.</p>
<p>The simplest free throw method is the two-handed underhand throw. This method involves using both hands to grip the ball on both sides with the fingers spread as much as possible (without the palms touching the ball). The grip should be firm and light. The feet should be shoulder-width apart and flat on the ground. If using the chest-pushing throwing method, the feet should be staggered. The body should first squat down, bending the knees, with the elbows hanging down close to the body. The center of gravity should be straight, not too far forward or too far back. When the ball is released, the body should rise accordingly, but not jump up or rush forward diagonally. Focus on the rim of the basket. The path of the ball should be from high to low, preferably without touching the backboard. However, if touching the backboard is easier, then do so. Do not change any free throw technique that you are accustomed to and have confidence in, otherwise, the new method will be even less accurate. The only point that should be changed is the error of often throwing outside the basket.</p>
<p>(8) Basketball Common Sense and Secrets</p>
<p>There are various ways to train shooting skills, which may vary depending on the instructor's interests and experience. However, regardless of the method used, in addition to technical practice, every player should be familiar with basketball common sense and secrets. Technical skills require a considerable amount of training time, but common sense and secrets can be understood with a single explanation, which can correct many errors. It can be said that it saves time and yields great results. The main points are described below:</p>
