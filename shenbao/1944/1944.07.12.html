<h3 id="c1">第四次市政諮詢會議觀感—討論中心為糧食問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>月之十日，本市市政諮詢委員會舉行第四次全體委員會議，自四時至六時歷兩小時時間，討論中心集中於糧食問題。陳市　長壁頭就提此問題，終結又提此問題，措詞之間，充分表示關切和流露憂慮，同時，鼓動同人不必灰心，愈是困難，愈是需要打破難關，不達解決目的不止。當然，諮詢會同人也有同樣的心情。</p>
<p>米統會的使命，是在增加食糧生產，獎勵民種植，確保公米，安定民食，奠立爭取大東亞戰爭勝利之基礎。可是，米統會成立以來，不但未測克盡使命，終因收買方法之錯誤，結果適得其反。減少食糧生產，農民逃避種植，公米未測確何，民食未測安定，造成今天的嚴重危機。這是米統會非改組不可的理由之一。</p>
<p>無論任何事業機構，尤其是統制機構，欲期事業辦有成效，第一個必要因素就是人事健全。米統會成立迄今，始終未能健全人事，實為失敗的致使之傷。人事旣不健全，又非專家主持的機構，而擔當如此重大的任務，其結果當然趨於失敗。這是米統會非改組不可的理由之二。</p>
<p>一個事業機構，由中日人士共同參加工作，本來是很理想的，尤其在目前中國正需要專家及技術人才之時，更需要日本人才協助，可是，在實際行政上如中日人士共同執行，難免發生朦混與推諉的流弊。為什麼呢？第一，如盟邦人七不甚深切瞭解中國政治與人民習慣，而共事的中國人士不能以實情坦白商討，一味迎合，一味敷衍，於是一切措施不免違背中國國情民情。第二，一般狡黠而無人格者，對於共事的日本人士所做之事，雖明知錯誤，但唯唯否否，不敢以正義力爭。而一方面，狐假虎威，假借營私，一切壤的結果與責任，完全諉卸於日人身上，或矯造日當局之授意，使一般人對於日本人士發生不良印象。這是中日合作最大的障礙。我們認識日本軍政當局無論在東京上海任何方面，對於中日以至東亞前途，都有熱烈遠大的抱負，希望國府力量增强，和平區人民生舌安定，從而推進中日合乍，達成大東亞戰爭勝利的最後目的。同時，日本的當局最喜中國人說老實話，決無絲亳使中國人民受不必要的苦痛之意思，使中國人民發生對日錯覺觀念。</p>
<p>辦理統制工作，尤其米糧統制，我始終認為全部由中國人負責較為妥適。可是，主持者必須最有人格；最能瞭解農民苦痛，最能瞭解中日合作，大東亞戰爭的重要意義。無論中日雙方所需的公米，均由國府　成米統會負責，如期如數交足，同時顧到民食之安定。總之，今後辦理糧政最理想的方式，我認為並不希望在行政方面盟邦人士多參加多干涉，而希望盟邦在運輪上治安上予以切實的最大的協助，在農業增產上予以技術的指導與協助，俾期米糧統制工作獲得適合計劃的進展。</p>
<p>更就實地觀察而言，上月間我們會往虹橋一帶視察米糧運入情形，並於十日晨復偕項康兀陳日平兩先生往漕河涇一帶視察，上次在實施征購以前，這次亦實施征購以後，上次脚踏車販米者絡繹於途，這次巳不見了，但有肩負背荷五斗以下者，人數亦不多。道可證明實施征購後上海近郊運米入口數量的减少。我認為征購一點在法律上是應有的，而在實際上，目前正在靑黃不接之時，即使征購為數亦極微，反足以刺激米價增高，與民食有害而與公家並無益處。</p>
<p>現在距新榖登塲僅及兩月，米統會當局只見着眼於目前徵購的末節，而尙未聞有較好的合理的統制收買方法，光陰如流水，轉瞬秋收即届，最使我們憂慮的，如果在新彀登塲前，米統會仍無革新的機構，仍無理想的領導人物，一反過去失敗的辦法，則前途危險黯淡，實不敢推想了。最近期間，米價自三四千元漲至八九千元，復漲至一萬二三千元，農民非但並無利益，仍以官價虧木出賣，而所有流動之米，大部在囤戶手中，在此米價波動中得暴利者唯有奸商與囤戶，尤應以最無情最嚴厲的戰時法律處置，執法不嚴，亦為米政不上軌道的一大原因。</p>
<p>總之，米糧問題至今日已届最嚴重最危險的階段，誠如陳市長說，愈是困難，愈須打破難關。我認為難關之鍵，在於政府有無決心負起確保公米，安定民食的重大責任？能否刷新改祖米統會？能否遴選適當人物主持辦班？有否適合國情民情的辦法，在新彀登塲時實施？如果仍無迅速決定的決心，則米糧問題決無好轉的前途。</p>

<p>軍事專家說明馬利亞納戰况</p>
<p>中央社訊關於馬利亞納乘島方面之戰况，美方正作　張性的宣傳，稱戰事獲得大成功，然太平洋之戰况，果能基於局部的戰塲與某一個時期的成敗而撕定乎，徵諸此次世界戰爭專實，僅在某一個大規模戰役　眼，　有鑄成大錯之處，對此次觀察，須用遠大眼光。關於此點，此間某軍事專家加以說明，彼以上海智識界人士，對於太平洋戰局應作確實之觀察，彼云，，塞班島戰事不論其最後結局如何，但日軍於六月十一日以米一個月內，在陸海空三方面展開之激戰中，對敵第五十八機動部隊主力，予以重大打擊，擊沉擊毀敵艦船五十艘以上，擊滅登陸敵軍一萬五千人以上，擊落敵機約七百架，故在摧殘敵兵力之作戰目的上，日軍已獲得非常成效。吉爾貝特羣島，馬紹爾羣島，馬利亞納羣島與日本本土愈接愈近，敵美之損害亦與日俱增，此種事實，敵方亦予承認。但相反日軍以比較敵人輕徵之損害，達到戰略上之目的，當然，塞班島目地理上言，接近日本本土，為軍事上一要衝，但終不過是太平洋上之一小烏而己，該島戰局之歸趨，於戰爭勝敗無甚影響。日本及大東亞各國之最精銳最有力之兵力，嚴密配置於日本本土及東亞大陸及南洋各主要島嶼上，敵軍如接近大東亞大陸，則其損害必將加甚。最後，尙有一點，回顧日本對外戰史，日本曾在本國近海兩度擊減世界大帝國之侵寇，當六百五十年之前，元國舉大兵襲九州北岸時，日本以寡敵衆，勇敢戰鬥，終於擊退元兵。再日俄大戰一役，日艦隊擊滅俄國艦隊，博得決定的勝利，由此兩百歷史，可知日本於敵人逼近本土時，必能發揮最大威力，此亦日本傳統之戰略。</p>

<p>目前日僑所最關心的，大約是食米配給將如何的問題吧！一部份人宣傳說，配給將於七月二十日停止，信以為眞的人不少。筆者前幾天曾向米統會當局問起北點，回答如下：</p>
<p>「米統會收買成績不住，大家都已知道了，但僑居此地的十萬名盟邦倫民的食米，尙不止停止配給。中國人　如主人，日本人是客人，家計食窮得主客都不能吃飽時候，照友誼的常例說來，總是興客人先吃鉋。七月份的不必說，即八月份的友邦人配給米，也已準備好了，請不必擔憂。朋</p>
<p>這對日本人眞是很感謝的答覆。現在是靑黃不接期，減七，八二月旣然已有準備，九月份自也不致中止配給，萬一配給有停止的模探，則筆者就沒有面子，向記者這樣答覆的米統會也沒有面十。策者的面子自然不成間題，可是為了米統　的面子，望不要食言，繼續配給。</p>
<p>日本人自然祗先想到日本方面的配給，這是人情之常，但我們阪願關於米糧問題中日二國人民的獲得成功的解决。</p>
<p>徵購四十石</p>
<p>七月一日，上海周　開始徵購米糧。翌日，筆者為要知道徵購了多少，乃訪問未統會，答說「約四十石」，這不能不說是太少了·「這並不可笑，假使用正式護照搬入，可以徵講得相常的數量」。現在不是笑的時侯，為了解决米的問題，毋寗應該是流淚的時侯。因此，筆者搜集了種種資料，檢討研究徵購政策。</p>
<p>聽說，用卡車運來的米糧，近搬入口時，改裝為五斗的小包，僱苦力運入。徵購的對象，假使是有正式護照的大批米糧，那也不成問題，但「對五斗以上，十石以下」云云的條例公佈以後，就大費手續，而那條例亦成為具文，這種現象，為了國府政治的威　，也不禁　堪憂　。</p>
<p>小販　的行動，売全被利　打算所左右。與其運一石米而被廉價徵購三斗，不如搬入五斗而避免徵購為有利。他們不會運一石米來逃過這徵購綱，必然一分為二，分次搬入。祇者於此感到條例與現實的矛盾。</p>
<p>米糧列車</p>
<p>從常州趁三等車來的筆者，在列車內所聞所見，不　　　塡　，想不到情形會惡劣到這地步。許多華中鐵道公司職員，對於偽造制服　扮做華鐵職員販運運大量米糧，不加過問。上海與海南綫各地米價之差，使有固定職業的人，也為了米而奔走。華鐵職員不過特別利用其便利的地位而已。這裹對華鐵當局及一般社會，都不能不有所說明。那就是華人車掌及其述黨華鐵職員，公然在乘客面前，向小阪等每斗米需索五十元。見此情景，不禁令人髪指。網棚上，椅子下，血紅着眼搜索米袋。從喂，三百元！」「喂！二百元！」看他們收入袋中。假使略嫌佣錢太多，而據理抗議，也就渦去了。在一班車中，道種索討佣金，一直到蘇州還不止。聽說這種狂態天天如此，且小販被削剝的不僅在火車中，於是上海米價焉能不高。在松江站，票子出賣後不久，即懸出客滿牌，想乘車的人，都想盡方法，到上海三等本來是三士兀，竟須百元之多。</p>
<p>筆者不是喜歡暴露醜惡者，但不能不在這裹鄭重指出，華鐵當局應取締這種惡劣職員。米糧的實物支給，自是佳事，受其惠者僅華鐵職員，但取締額外需索，則其恩惠所及，將極廣泛。</p>
<p>懲處奸商</p>
<p>奸商應絕對加以逮捕，處以嚴刑。我們常聽說，經濟保安處在幹些什麼？善良民衆，决不反對徵伐奸商。「什麼條例」，「什麼法律」，以實際不適應近代的東西為基準，其效果極少，在這齊黃不接期，有攪亂米糧行為的逆賊份子，應該游街示衆，向五百萬市民宣佈其罪狀，徹底的毀傷其面子，然後再處刑。</p>
<p>信奉近代法律的人，或許反對這種做法，但這是適應中國社會現階段的有效的處罰方法。新中國報社評前提出這種方法，憎惡奸商的中國人聞之亦以為善。華鐵的不正職員，亦應在上海站前宜佈罪狀，枷立三日示衆。</p>
<p>米糧對策早巳不是紙上空談所能解央的了。依常識而論，應大胆採用突然的，合乎人情的多方面的工作。這不過是對於處罰的一點小意見，共他許多工作，也應該採取「非常　的常」之方法。（　自七月六日大陸新報竹本特派員通訊）</p>

<h3 id="c12">市政諮詢委員會　商討米糧問題　陳市長表示接受各項建議 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>陳市長於十日下午四時在第一區公署，招待市政諮詢委員會全體委員舉行茶會，並同時舉行第四次全體會議，陳市長與吳秘書長準時蒞塲招待，市政諮詢委員除李思浩，袁履登等，因病缺席外，各委員均出席，計到林康侯·趙晋卿·沈嗣良·吳震修·趙正平等，及市府所屬各局處長亦均參加，共三十餘人。</p>
<p>陳市長詞</p>
<p>首由陳市長致詞略謂：市政諮詢委員會成立以來，對於市政備承協助，故能上下融洽，彼此諒解，實深感謝。自上海行政統一，應行興革之事，千頭萬緒，惟以米糧問題，日趨嚴重，至今可謂已達極點，諮詢會方面於此悉心研討，不遺餘力，尤堪欽佩。木人在南京時，每日接到市府報告，甚感焦慮，最近蒞滬，又悉米統會實施徵購後，益見刺激米價之上漲。本來微購制度，可以不辦，完全自由買賣亦好，如須充實配給時，不妨由政府機關直接大量收買，無須零星徵購。此項問題欲求根本解決，實有與有關方面開誠商討之必要。本市因近來發生種種難題，致勞各位費心費力，本人至感不安，希望各位與市府合爲一體，相互協助，並盼儘量發表意見，毋庸絲毫客氣，實爲本人所當感謝不已者。</p>
<p>林康侯詞</p>
<p>繼由委員林康侯氏報告諮詢委員會第三次大會以後所有向市政當局之建議事項，其重要者，關於米糧方面，如商請米統會廢止五斗以下之丙種證明單，請市府設法增加雜糧配給，並辦理平糶，從速組織巡查隊，取締沿途勒索，及繼續維持戶口米配給制度等。又關於今年秋收時，採辦米糧問題，已推定委員研究具體計劃，以備建議，現正在擬訂中。</p>
<p>教育問題</p>
<p>委員沈嗣良氏報告教育小組委員會會議情形，謂敎育問題，現亦非常嚴重，學費提高，則勢必激增失學之子弟，低廉則敎職員無以維持生活，故本會討論結果，認爲公立學校學費，可以較廉，但必須設法擴充，儘量容納學生。私立學校應應由政府予以補助，私立學校敎職員亦當與公立學校同樣待遇，給予特別配給，庶幾學費可望减收至最低限度。下半年市府收人如能稍裕，必須多多增撥敎育經費，實爲最所希望。</p>
<p>米糧問題</p>
<p>嗣由吳秘書長及馮局長先後將最近致力於米糧問題之經過情形，作簡賅之報告，並歷舉事實，說明市府在行政能力所逮之範圍內，巳盡力辦理，至今後關於配給方法及救濟貧民食糧等項，亦附帶提及。復由陳彬酥·項康原·金雄白·趙晋卿·林康侯諸氏，相繼發表意見，對於當前米糧問題，認爲有兩點最關重要者，即各產米地應由當地政府機機關商會等公定價格，及制止商人競爭購買，但此兩點採米機機關未能實行，遂致米價高漲，希望米統會與市府密切合作，並從速改組，以求人事健全，並希望中央運用最大權力，疏通各地來源云。此外關於最近警局方面嚴令各工廠組織特別自警團，事態嚴重，致使各工廠發生種種困難，妨　生產，影響匪淺，希望當局特別注意云。</p>
<p>重要建議</p>
<p>最後由陳彬酥提出重要建議：　希望市府再向米統會交涉，至遲於七月底前取銷十石以下五斗以上之另星微購，並由中央明令米統會，嗣後如有關於上海方面新辦法實施，必須事前與上海市政府取得密切聯絡。　呈准中央從速設置上海米糧公倉。　私立學校敎職員亦當予以特別配給。　雜糧等平糶事宜，希望於最近期內實施，當經全塲贊成通過。</p>
<p>末由陳市長說明中央對於米糧問題之處理情形，並表示對於今日各項建議完全接受，此次會議議歷時二小時之久，尤其關於米糧間題檢討最爲詳盡，足微市府當局與諮詢委員會正在竭號智慮，力圖民食問題之解决云。至六時許始告敬會。</p>

<p>華成公司淸算十足退回股款</p>
<p>近數月來股票由極盛期而銳變爲極衰期，這在整個經濟上言，都是不合理的病態。爲什麼股票急漲與銳落，除了經濟上的因素以外，常然是追求暴利主義者的投機行動佔極大部分，這裹我們不必詳論。</p>
<p>現在有很多新股票，價值跌進票面以內，還有未曾上市而由黑市授受者，只值票面二三成，更爲悽慘。我們知道數月以前的一個時期，股票節節上漲，新設公司吸引投資者如雨後春筍，所謂投資者大部分是薪水階級，爲小額股票易獲重利的誘惑而衝動，於是節衣縮食甚至典衣質物，凑集現金認購新股，其後股市驟變，莫不虧換累累。而一方面物價則日漲，這予一般薪水階級的打擊殊爲嚴重。</p>
<p>現在華成實業公司有淸算資產按票面實值退回股款之舉，觀其啟事用意，爲體恤小額股東之利益。在目前投機暴利的氣氛中，有此衆醉獨醒之舉，實足淸醒社會耳目。</p>
<p>我們希望各新公司考慮本身信譽，不妨倣效。或局部减資，以財產變值先照票面償還一部分，以保障股東權利，而爲後來生產事業吸引投資樹立信譽。同時，非生產事業之公司尤應全部淸算，償還股款。並盼主管機關及市商會各業公會等共同注意此一問題，商議整個補救辦法。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Impressions of the Fourth Municipal Consultative Conference—Focus of Discussion: Food Issues <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, the Municipal Consultative Committee of this city held its fourth plenary session, lasting two hours from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The discussion centered on the food issue. Mayor Chen Bito raised this issue at the beginning and at the end, his words fully expressing concern and revealing anxiety. At the same time, he encouraged colleagues not to be discouraged, emphasizing that the greater the difficulty, the more necessary it is to overcome it, and not to stop until the goal is achieved. Of course, the members of the Consultative Committee shared the same sentiment.</p>
<p>The mission of the Rice Control Commission is to increase food production, encourage farmers to plant, ensure public rice supply, stabilize people's food, and lay the foundation for winning the Greater East Asia War. However, since its establishment, the Rice Control Commission has not only failed to fulfill its mission but has also achieved the opposite effect due to flawed purchasing methods. Food production has decreased, farmers have avoided planting, the public rice supply remains uncertain, and people's food has not been stabilized, leading to today's serious crisis. This is one of the reasons why the Rice Control Commission must be reorganized.</p>
<p>For any business organization, especially a control agency, the first necessary factor for achieving success is sound personnel. Since its establishment, the Rice Control Commission has consistently failed to ensure sound personnel, which is a fatal flaw leading to its failure. An agency with unsound personnel and not led by experts cannot be expected to handle such a significant task, and the result is naturally failure. This is the second reason why the Rice Control Commission must be reorganized.</p>
<p>It is ideal for Chinese and Japanese personnel to work together in a business organization, especially when China needs experts and technical talent. However, in actual administration, joint execution by Chinese and Japanese personnel inevitably leads to obscurity and buck-passing. Why? First, if allied personnel do not deeply understand Chinese politics and people's customs, and the Chinese personnel working with them cannot frankly discuss the real situation, but only cater and prevaricate, all measures inevitably deviate from China's national and popular sentiments. Second, cunning and unscrupulous individuals, although knowing that the actions of the Japanese personnel they work with are wrong, only say yes and dare not argue for justice. On the other hand, they abuse their authority for personal gain and completely shift all the bad results and responsibilities onto the Japanese, or fabricate instructions from the Japanese authorities, causing the general public to have a bad impression of the Japanese. This is the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese cooperation. We recognize that the Japanese military and political authorities, whether in Tokyo or Shanghai, have ardent and far-sighted aspirations for the future of Sino-Japanese relations and even East Asia, hoping to strengthen the National Government's power, stabilize the lives of people in the peace zone, thereby promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation and achieving the ultimate goal of winning the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the Japanese authorities most appreciate Chinese people telling the truth and have no intention of causing unnecessary suffering to the Chinese people, causing the Chinese people to have misconceptions about Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding the management of control work, especially rice control, I have always believed that it is more appropriate for it to be entirely the responsibility of the Chinese. However, the person in charge must be of the highest integrity, most able to understand the suffering of farmers, and most able to understand the important significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War. The National Government and the Rice Control Commission should be responsible for providing the required public rice for both China and Japan, delivering it on time and in full, while also ensuring the stability of people's food. In short, the most ideal way to manage food administration in the future, in my opinion, is not to hope that allied personnel participate or interfere more in administration, but to hope that the allies provide practical and maximum assistance in transportation and security, and provide technical guidance and assistance in agricultural production, so that the rice control work can achieve progress in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from practical observation, we went to the Hongqiao area last month to inspect the situation of rice being transported in. On the morning of the 10th, we again accompanied Mr. Xiang Kangwu and Mr. Chen Riping to inspect the Caohejing area. The last time was before the implementation of compulsory purchase, and this time was after the implementation. Last time, bicycle vendors selling rice were seen in droves, but this time they were gone. However, there were some people carrying loads of five dou or less, but their numbers were also small. This proves that the amount of rice transported into the suburbs of Shanghai has decreased after the implementation of compulsory purchase. I believe that compulsory purchase is justified in law, but in practice, at this time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available, even if the amount of compulsory purchase is very small, it will only stimulate rice prices to increase, which is harmful to the people's food and of no benefit to the public.</p>
<p>Now, there are only two months left until the new grain harvest. The authorities of the Rice Control Commission are only focusing on the trivial details of current compulsory purchase and have not yet heard of any better or more reasonable control and purchasing methods. Time flies like water, and the autumn harvest is approaching in the blink of an eye. What worries us most is that if the Rice Control Commission still has no innovative structure or ideal leadership figures before the new grain harvest, and reverses the failed methods of the past, the future will be dangerous and bleak, and we dare not imagine it. Recently, the price of rice has risen from three or four thousand yuan to eight or nine thousand yuan, and then to twelve or thirteen thousand yuan. Farmers not only do not benefit, but still sell at a loss at official prices. Most of the mobile rice is in the hands of hoarders. The only ones who profit from this rice price fluctuation are unscrupulous merchants and hoarders, who should be dealt with in the most ruthless and severe wartime laws. Lax enforcement is also a major reason why rice administration is not on track.</p>
<p>In short, the rice and food issue has reached its most serious and dangerous stage today. As Mayor Chen said, the more difficult it is, the more necessary it is to overcome it. I believe that the key to overcoming the difficulty lies in whether the government has the determination to take on the important responsibility of ensuring public rice supply and stabilizing people's food. Can the Rice Control Commission be reformed and reorganized? Can appropriate people be selected to host the program? Are there any methods suitable for the national and popular sentiments to be implemented when the new grain is harvested? If there is still no determination to make a quick decision, then the rice and food issue will have no prospects for improvement.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that the Japanese forces on the Saipan front have been fighting fiercely since July 4th, inflicting great losses on the enemy.

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that the enemy is gradually increasing its air power on Saipan Island. On the 10th, Aslito Airfield saw an addition of several large aircraft and fifty small aircraft. Simultaneously, there were more than twenty large flying boats in Saipan harbor. Furthermore, in the sea area near the northwest of Tinian Island, a powerful fleet consisting of two aircraft carriers as its core, along with cruisers, destroyers, and over thirty other vessels, was sighted. The enemy's attacks on the Japanese positions around Saipan Island are also gradually intensifying. For example, on the 10th, a total of about ninety enemy aircraft attacked Omiya Island, bombing the fortresses and coastal positions there. At the same time, enemy cruisers and destroyers also carried out artillery fire. In addition, Tinian and Rota Islands were also attacked by dozens of enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — On the 9th, over seventy enemy aircraft attacked Omiya Island. Several dozens of them attacked the Japanese airfield, and the other dozens attacked the coastal fortresses and positions. At the same time, several enemy cruisers and destroyers fired shells at the island. After fierce fighting, they retreated with damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that over twenty enemy large aircraft attacked Yap Island on the 10th. After fierce resistance by the Japanese garrison, six of them were shot down, and the remaining enemy aircraft were repelled. Furthermore, from the night of the 8th to dawn on the 9th, twenty-three large aircraft also attacked Truk Island, but were repelled after fierce resistance by the Japanese garrison.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Continuous Heavy Rain in Northern Burma; Japanese Forces Continue Fierce Attacks; Sweeping Operations Conducted on the Nu River <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) — A report from the Northern Burma front on the 11th states that the Japanese forces, amidst continuous heavy rain, are continuing to fiercely attack the U.S.-Chinese Allied forces attempting to recapture Myitkyina, a key point in Northern Burma. The enemy's airborne supplies have been completely blocked due to the rapid advance of the Japanese forces and the rain. In addition, the enemy's morale is significantly weakened due to the prevalence of epidemics. Since the 29th of last month, the main force of the enemy's 42nd Regiment and about 400 U.S. troops have been attacking the Japanese positions north of Myitkyina. The Japanese forces engaged them in a fierce hand-to-hand combat, and the enemy forces were on the verge of collapse. By the morning of the 2nd of this month, most of them had been annihilated. In this operation, the Japanese forces achieved the following results: 1,351 enemy bodies left behind, 74 captured, 3 light mortars seized, 80 heavy and light machine guns, 87 rifles, 2 wireless radio stations and 2 telephones, and over 21,020 rounds of various types of ammunition.</p>
<p>Japanese Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency) — The main force of the Japanese army attacking the enemy on the banks of the Nu River has further strengthened its offensive capabilities as of today, and is fiercely attacking the enemy forces everywhere in the mud, day and night. Since the first attack on the Nu River, the enemy has suffered more than 23,000 casualties. Dreaming of recapturing Northern Burma, they have dispatched rear troops to the area. Two days ago, the 228th Regiment of the enemy's 26th Division, using a location eight kilometers southeast of Longling as a base, attempted to hinder the traffic between Mangshi and Longling. To preempt the enemy, the Japanese army suddenly attacked behind the enemy on the 5th, and launched a strong attack on the enemy's main positions in the thick fog at dawn on the 6th. The enemy was unable to resist and collapsed to the east, west and north. In addition, the enemy forces near Mangshi, which were subjected to the control of the powerful Japanese forces, have long been attacked by Japanese commando units and have been breached by the accurate shelling of the Japanese army. There are many corpses abandoned everywhere. Since the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army has been continuing sweeping operations using the moonlight.</p>

<p>Military Expert Explains Mariana Islands Situation</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Regarding the situation in the Mariana Islands, the U.S. side is making exaggerated propaganda, claiming great success. However, can the situation in the Pacific War be determined based on the success or failure of a local battlefield or a certain period? Citing the actual circumstances of this world war, focusing only on a certain large-scale battle is prone to making major mistakes. For this observation, a broad perspective must be used. Regarding this point, a certain military expert here provided an explanation, hoping that Shanghai intellectuals would make accurate observations of the Pacific War. He said that regardless of the final outcome of the Saipan Island battle, the Japanese forces, in the fierce battles launched on land, sea, and air over a month from June 11th, inflicted a major blow on the main force of the enemy's 58th Mobile Force, sinking or destroying more than 50 enemy warships, annihilating more than 15,000 enemy landing troops, and shooting down approximately 700 enemy aircraft. Therefore, the Japanese forces have achieved very effective results in the operational objective of destroying enemy forces. The closer the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, and Mariana Islands are to the Japanese mainland, the greater the damage to the enemy, a fact that the enemy also acknowledges. Conversely, the Japanese army achieved strategic goals with less loss. Of course, in terms of geography, Saipan is close to the Japanese mainland, and is an important military point, but is nothing more than a small island in the Pacific Ocean, and the trend of the battle on the island has no impact on victory or defeat of war. The most elite and powerful military strength of Japan and the Greater East Asia countries is strictly deployed on the Japanese mainland and the main islands of the East Asian continent and the South Seas. If the enemy forces approach the Greater East Asia continent, their losses will be even greater. Finally, there is one more point. Looking back at Japan's war history, Japan has twice repelled invaders from great world empires in its coastal waters. When the Yuan Dynasty launched a large-scale invasion of the northern coast of Kyushu 650 years ago, Japan fought bravely with fewer troops and ultimately repelled the Yuan troops. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese fleet annihilated the Russian fleet and won a decisive victory. From these two historical events, it can be seen that Japan will be able to exert its greatest power when the enemy approaches its mainland. This is also Japan's traditional strategy.</p>

On the morning of the 9th, the enemy forces on the front line's main positions near Lidongxu were in a state of great chaos due to the Japanese advance. Nimitz's boast of ensuring the mainland and preventing the 7th War Zone Army from holding on to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been completely shattered. The Japanese army's grand plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and divide the Chinese mainland is gradually approaching completion. The Japanese soldiers are fiercely advancing towards Shaoguan, the enemy's main stronghold.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base in China, 11th (Central News Agency) — Japanese bomber squadrons have been strongly attacking the enemy bases in Chongqing for days and have achieved great results.

<h3 id="e11">Observations from a Rice Train <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>What the Japanese residents are most concerned about right now is probably the issue of rice rations. Some people are spreading the rumor that rations will stop on July 20th, and many believe it to be true. A few days ago, I asked the Rice Control Association about this, and the answer was as follows:</p>
<p>"Everyone knows that the Rice Control Association's procurement performance is not good, but the rice for the 100,000 Allied nationals living here will certainly not stop being rationed. The Chinese are like the hosts, and the Japanese are the guests. According to the usual rules of friendship, when a family is so poor that neither the host nor the guest can eat their fill, the guest should always eat first. Not to mention July, the rationed rice for the Allied people for August is also prepared, so please do not worry."</p>
<p>This is a very grateful reply for the Japanese. Now is the lean season, and since preparations have already been made for July and August, it is unlikely that rations will be stopped in September. If the distribution has a model to stop, then I will not have face, and the Rice Control Association, which replied to the reporter like this, will also have no face. My face is naturally not the problem, but for the sake of the Rice Control Association's face, I hope they will not break their promise and continue to distribute rations.</p>
<p>The Japanese naturally only think about the Japanese side's rations first, which is human nature, but we hope that the rice problem will be successfully resolved for both the Chinese and Japanese people.</p>
<p>Procuring Forty Shi</p>
<p>On July 1st, Shanghai began procuring rice. The next day, in order to find out how much had been procured, I visited the Rice Control Association, which replied "about forty shi." This cannot be said to be too little. "This is not laughable, if you move in with a formal passport, you can procure a considerable quantity." Now is not the time to laugh, but the time to shed tears in order to solve the rice problem. Therefore, I collected various materials to examine and study the procurement policy.</p>
<p>I heard that the rice transported by trucks is repackaged into small five-dou bags when it is brought in, and laborers are hired to transport it in. If the target of the procurement is a large amount of rice with formal passports, then it is not a problem, but after the promulgation of the regulation "for more than five dou and less than ten shi," the procedure becomes very troublesome, and that regulation also becomes a mere formality. This phenomenon is also worrying for the prestige of the National Government.</p>
<p>The actions of the peddlers are entirely dominated by profit considerations. Rather than transporting one shi of rice and being procured for three dou at a low price, it is more profitable to transport five dou and avoid procurement. They will not transport one shi of rice to escape this procurement net, but will inevitably divide it into two and transport it in multiple times. I feel the contradiction between the regulations and reality here.</p>
<p>Rice Train</p>
<p>I, who came from Changzhou on a third-class train, was unable to contain my feelings upon hearing and seeing what was happening on the train. I did not expect the situation to be so bad. Many employees of the Central China Railway Company do not question the forgery of uniforms to impersonate China Railway employees and transport large amounts of rice. The price difference between rice in Shanghai and various places on the Hainan line has led people with fixed jobs to run around for rice. China Railway employees are just taking advantage of their convenient position. There is something that must be explained here to the China Railway authorities and the general public. That is, Chinese conductors and their accomplices, China Railway employees, openly demand fifty yuan per dou of rice from small vendors in front of passengers. Seeing this scene, one cannot help but bristle with anger. On the luggage racks and under the seats, they search for rice bags with bloodshot eyes. "Hey, three hundred yuan!" "Hey! Two hundred yuan!" They watch them put it in their pockets. If they slightly dislike the commission being too high and protest according to reason, it is gone. On a train, this kind of extortion of commissions continues all the way to Suzhou and beyond. It is said that this madness is happening every day, and the peddlers are not only being exploited on the train, so how can the price of rice in Shanghai not be high? At Songjiang Station, shortly after the tickets were sold, a "full" sign was hung out. Those who wanted to take the train tried every means, and the third class fare to Shanghai, which was originally three yuan, actually cost more than one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>I am not someone who likes to expose ugliness, but I cannot help but solemnly point out here that the China Railway authorities should crack down on these bad employees. Distribution of rice in kind is certainly a good thing, and only China Railway employees benefit from it, but cracking down on extra demands will extend the benefits widely.</p>
<p>Punishing Profiteers</p>
<p>Profiteers should absolutely be arrested and severely punished. We often hear, what is the Economic Security Bureau doing? Good people will never oppose conquering profiteers. The effectiveness of "what regulations" and "what laws" based on things that are actually unsuitable for the modern era is minimal. In this lean season, traitors who disrupt the rice trade should be paraded through the streets to announce their crimes to the five million citizens, completely destroy their face, and then execute them.</p>
<p>Those who believe in modern law may object to this approach, but this is an effective punishment method that is adapted to the current stage of Chinese society. The New China Newspaper's editorial office proposed this method, and the Chinese who hate profiteers also thought it was good when they heard it. Corrupt China Railway employees should also have their crimes announced in front of Shanghai Station and be publicly displayed in cangues for three days.</p>
<p>Rice countermeasures can no longer be solved by empty talk on paper. According to common sense, bold and sudden, humane, and multifaceted work should be adopted. This is just a small opinion on punishment, and many other tasks should also adopt the method of "uncommonness as the norm." (Communication from Takemoto, special correspondent for the Mainland New Daily, July 6)</p>

<p>Mayor Chen hosted a tea party for all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee at the First District Office at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th, and also held the fourth plenary meeting. Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Wu arrived on time to host. In addition to Li Sihao and Yuan Ludeng, who were absent due to illness, all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee attended, including Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Siliang, Wu Zhenxiu, Zhao Zhengping, and others, as well as the heads of various bureaus and departments under the municipal government, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen first gave a speech, saying: Since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it has provided assistance to the municipal administration, so that there can be harmony between the top and bottom and mutual understanding, which is deeply appreciated. Since the unification of Shanghai's administration, there are thousands of things that should be reformed, but the rice problem is becoming more and more serious, and it can be said that it has reached its limit today. The Advisory Committee has carefully studied this and spared no effort, which is especially admirable. When I was in Nanjing, I received reports from the municipal government every day, which made me feel very anxious. Recently, when I came to Shanghai, I learned that the implementation of procurement by the Rice Control Association further stimulated the rise in rice prices. Originally, the procurement system can be dispensed with, and it is good to have completely free buying and selling. If it is necessary to enrich the rations, the government can directly buy a large amount, without the need for piecemeal procurement. To fundamentally solve this problem, it is necessary to have an open and honest discussion with relevant parties. This city has encountered various difficulties recently, which has caused you to worry and work hard. I am very uneasy. I hope that you will work together with the municipal government, assist each other, and express your opinions as much as possible, without any reservations, which is what I should be grateful for.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Committee Member Lin Kanghou reported on all the recommendations made to the municipal authorities after the third general meeting of the Advisory Committee. The most important ones, regarding rice, include requesting the Rice Control Association to abolish the Class C certificate for less than five dou, requesting the municipal government to find ways to increase the distribution of miscellaneous grains and handle price controls, quickly organizing patrol teams to crack down on extortion along the way, and continuing to maintain the household rice rationing system. Regarding the issue of purchasing rice during this year's autumn harvest, a committee member has been designated to study a concrete plan for recommendations, which is currently being drafted.</p>
<p>Education Issues</p>
<p>Committee Member Shen Siliang reported on the meeting of the Education Subcommittee, saying that education issues are also very serious now. If tuition fees are increased, the number of children dropping out of school will inevitably increase sharply. If tuition fees are low, teachers and staff will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the consensus of the committee's discussion is that tuition fees in public schools can be lower, but efforts must be made to expand and accommodate as many students as possible. Private schools should be subsidized by the government, and teachers and staff in private schools should be given the same treatment as those in public schools, and given special rations, so that tuition fees can be reduced to the lowest possible level. If the municipal government's revenue in the second half of the year can be slightly better, more education funds must be allocated, which is the most desired.</p>
<p>Rice Issues</p>
<p>Subsequently, Secretary-General Wu and Director Feng successively gave brief reports on the recent efforts to address the rice issue, and listed facts to show that the municipal government has tried its best to handle the matter within the scope of its administrative capabilities. The distribution methods and relief of food for the poor were also mentioned in passing. Then, Chen Binsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Jin Xiongbai, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou and others successively expressed their opinions, and believed that two points were most important for the current rice problem: that the local governments, agencies, chambers of commerce, etc. in each rice-producing area should set the price publicly, and that competition among merchants should be stopped. However, the rice-collecting agencies have failed to implement these two points, which has led to the rise in rice prices. It is hoped that the Rice Control Association and the municipal government will cooperate closely and reorganize as soon as possible to seek sound personnel. It is also hoped that the central government will use its maximum power to dredge sources from all over. In addition, regarding the recent strict order from the police to all factories to organize special self-defense corps, the situation is serious, causing various difficulties in the factories, hindering production, and affecting it significantly. It is hoped that the authorities will pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>Important Recommendations</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Binsu made important recommendations: It is hoped that the municipal government will negotiate with the Rice Control Association again to cancel the separate procurement of less than ten shi and more than five dou no later than the end of July, and that the central government will issue a clear order to the Rice Control Association that in the future, if there are any new measures implemented regarding Shanghai, it must obtain close contact with the Shanghai Municipal Government in advance. Present to the central government to quickly set up a Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse. Special rations should also be given to teachers and staff in private schools. It is hoped that the price control of miscellaneous grains and other matters will be implemented in the near future, and it was passed by unanimous consent.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Chen explained the central government's handling of the rice issue and expressed his complete acceptance of the various recommendations made today. This meeting lasted for two hours, and the most detailed review was conducted on the rice issue, which shows that the municipal government and the Advisory Committee are trying their best to solve the people's food problem. The meeting ended at about 6 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e13">No Procurement of Rice Shipments Under Ten Shi Rice Control Association Announces Immediate Implementation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has requested the Rice Control Association to promptly revise Article 7 of the announced measures for transporting rice (i.e., procuring three dou per shi for shipments between five dou and ten shi) in order to stabilize rice prices. It is reported that the association has replied by letter to comply, and will stop the micro-procurement from July 12th, and will send letters to the Economic Office of the First District and various license-issuing offices, and will also notify the public. The original text of the announcement is recorded below: Rice Control Committee Announcement No. 17, for the Shanghai Municipal Government's letter stating that Article 7 of the Measures for Transporting Rice (i.e., the application for rice shipments between five dou and ten shi will be procured by 30%) should be revised promptly. In addition to the letter, the announcement will be notified. According to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's letter No. 7011 of July 7 this year, it is said that the recent sharp increase in rice prices is due to the micro-procurement effect of Article 7 of the Measures for Transporting Rice. It is requested to revise it promptly to stabilize rice prices, etc. Approved, it is found that the soaring rice prices in Shanghai are due to various reasons. If it is said that rice dealers are deliberately raising prices under the pretext of procurement, it may be difficult to avoid. In addition to the request from the Shanghai Municipal Government to approve the deletion of Article 7 of the Measures for Transporting Rice (that is, when citizens transport rice to the entrance, the quantity of rice transported must be verified by personnel dispatched by this office, weighed, and then procured by 30% according to the procurement percentage, (that is, three dou per shi for shipments between five dou and ten shi) and paid according to the prescribed price, and rice shipments under five dou will not be procured) from today, and letters will be sent to the Economic Office of the First District Office and various temporary license-issuing offices of this association for reference and implementation. All merchants and people are required to be fully aware of this, and this is hereby announced. July 11, 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chairman Yuan Ludeng is on leave, temporarily replacing Chairman Chen Guozhong.</p>

<p>The stock market is sluggish and stock prices have fallen below the actual value of the assets of various companies. It is now heard that Huacheng Industrial Company, run by Zhang Shankun and others, will convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 31 to discuss automatic liquidation and sell the company's assets separately. It is estimated that each share can be redeemed at face value. When the company's stock price fell the most severely, each share was only worth three or four yuan. The news of this full refund will protect the interests of small shareholders and stabilize the social economy. However, there are more than a dozen new stocks that have fallen below par and are in the same dire situation as Huacheng. The leaders of these companies are all well-known figures in society and should follow Huacheng's example to establish future credibility.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Production Enterprise Stocks Approved for Transfer and Mortgage <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has specially formulated a method for transferring and mortgaging various listed stocks for loans and using them as substitutes for the deposit reserve of the banks and other financial institutions, in order to promote productive enterprises. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to various financial institutions for reference and implementation. The method is recorded below: For all kinds of listed stocks used as substitutes for transfer, mortgage or deposit reserves, they should be limited to productive enterprises, such as cotton, wool, textile, printing and dyeing factories, pharmaceutical factories, machine manufacturing factories, paper mills, and flour mills. When accepting the stocks of the above-mentioned factories for transfer and mortgage loans, it must be handled according to the following points: A. The factory must be actually operating, or have resumed operation after being suspended. B. The factory's products must be daily necessities for people's livelihood and related to military needs. C. The factory must be strong in financial resources and have been established for many years, and have a social and economic position. D. The actual value of the factory's stock must exceed the face value of the issuance. E. The mortgage loan is calculated at 30% to 40% of the market price, and the reserve substitute is calculated at 40% to 50% of the market price. For the above-mentioned discounts, if the market price exceeds one times the face value or falls below the face value, it may be re-approved. Stocks of industrial shares or construction shares, etc., that have their own factories, can directly operate, and can meet the various principles of Article 2, etc., can also use the stocks as substitutes for transfer, mortgage and deposit reserves. The discount for this type of stock transfer and mortgage is calculated at 20% of the market price, and the reserve substitute is calculated at 30% of the market price.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Sober in a Drunken World <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Huacheng Company Liquidates and Returns Share Payments in Full</p>
<p>In recent months, stocks have changed sharply from a period of extreme prosperity to a period of extreme decline, which is an unreasonable and morbid state in the entire economy. Why do stocks rise and fall sharply? In addition to economic factors, the speculative actions of those who pursue quick profits naturally account for a large part, which we do not need to discuss in detail here.</p>
<p>Now there are many new stocks whose value has fallen below par, and there are also those that have not been listed but are transferred in the black market, which are only worth 20% to 30% of the face value, which is even more miserable. We know that in a period several months ago, stock prices rose steadily, and newly established companies attracted investors like bamboo shoots after rain. Most of the so-called investors were salaried workers, who were motivated by the temptation of small stocks making big profits. Therefore, they saved money on food and clothing, and even pawned their clothes and belongings, to raise cash to subscribe for new shares. Later, the stock market changed suddenly, and they all suffered heavy losses. On the other hand, prices rose daily, which was a very serious blow to salaried workers in general.</p>
<p>Now Huacheng Industrial Company has taken the step of liquidating assets and returning share payments at their actual face value, and its announcement shows that its intention is to take care of the interests of small shareholders. In the current atmosphere of speculation and quick profits, this step of being sober in a drunken world is enough to sober up society.</p>
<p>We hope that various new companies will consider their own reputation and may as well follow suit. Or partially reduce capital, and use the changed value of the property to repay part of it at face value first, in order to protect the rights of shareholders and establish a reputation for attracting investment in future productive enterprises. At the same time, non-productive companies should be completely liquidated and the share payments repaid. We also hope that the competent authorities and the various industry associations of the city's Chamber of Commerce will pay attention to this issue together and discuss a comprehensive remedy.</p>

<p>The method for exempting private schools from property and land taxes and miscellaneous taxes has been seen in various newspapers on the 5th. Now, the eighth meeting of the Municipal Government's Finance Committee has resolved that it will be temporarily applied in the First District. The Municipal Government is ordering the Municipal Education Bureau to comply with it. All private schools in the First District that have been approved by the Education Bureau for establishment and registered before the incident may apply for subsidies.</p>

<p>The Huangpu Branch Bureau, in order to familiarize the Baojia air defense personnel with various air defense measures, separately summoned the air defense corps of each Lianbao Baojia to hold large-scale drills in rotation. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday (11th), all air defense corps members of the Fourth Lianbao were summoned to hold a large-scale drill on the large drill ground in front of the bureau. The bureau invited Japanese troops and Baojia personnel from various districts to visit. Under the command of Xiaolin and Liu Yaying, two branch directors of the bureau, the corps members, wearing full uniforms and steel helmets, and with high spirits, first rehearsed various essential air defense measures such as fire fighting, bomb extinguishing, rescue, and evacuation. The techniques were very proficient. After the Lianbao Chief held a review, a fire extinguishing bomb extinguishing performance was held. Personnel from the Public Security Fire Extinguishing Bomb Factory were sent to perform, and the Lianbao air defense corps members watched and learned. A wooden house was first built, with bricks and tiles inside, and ignited. When the flames burst through the roof, the glass fire extinguishing bomb was thrown into the fire, and it was extinguished on the spot. The results were excellent.</p>
