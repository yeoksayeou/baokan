<h3 id="c1">避免不必要的痛苦 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一昨我們論及孔子是大政治家，他的政治哲學是在[得民心]，他先求社會安定，然後乃得齊民翕服。而以[不患寡而患不均，不患貧而患不安]兩點入手，以謀社會的[均]與[安]。他更以[發憤忘食，樂以忘憂，不知老之將至]的積極精神，以求他的主張實現。　　其實，爲政之道，在得民心，巳爲古今中外歷史上施政的原則，也可以說得民心者，其國昌盛，失民心者，其國衰亡，巳爲任何國家歷史上的定律。孔子之時爲君主國家，雖以君爲中心，但仍以民心爲重，因爲[民爲邦本]，如不以民爲重，則無人民的國家，不能並立於世，無可置疑的。　　誠如日前中國新聞協會成立大會中，李會長致詞云：[中國是[民國]，中國政府是[國民政府]，還有人說[官吏爲人民的公僕]，所以無論在客觀上主觀上，對於人民利益，首須重視，尤其民間痛苦，特別指出，不厭求詳，促起關係方面共同注意改善。]中國原以人民爲主體，那末，人民利益，自然更應重視。所以，政治的對象，必須爲人民利益。政府原是一個呆的機關，活用的卻是政府中的執政者，所以，執政者應深入民間，雖不能時時親自涉歷民間，但至少對於民間疾苦，時時加以重視，時時傾聽民間意見。以人溺已溺，人飢已飢的心情，爲民間疾苦，打算解除之道，所謂得民心者，不外於此。　　不過，目前是戰時，戰時國家的人民生活，不能與平時相比，戰時的人民生活，就是要吃苦，要增加負擔。誠然，這是天經地襲的。但是，我們同時也須明瞭，吃苦與增重負擔，應該有尺度的，爲了有利於戰爭，爲了爭取勝利，自應在任何環境下咬緊牙關吃苦。然而，藉了戰時的名義而增加不必要的負擔，吃的不必要的苦，不但無利於戰爭，而且有礙於戰爭，因爲不必要的苦，很足以增加人民的反感，無形中減少取勝的潛力。所以，執政者應竭力爲人民避免不必要的痛苦。譬如一萬二千元一石的黑市米，就是不必要的痛苦，如果執政者對於米政辦好，米價黑市不至於高到如此的。又如火車輪船票的黑市，價值高出票價數倍，雖有定價之名，而無法購票。這些都是不必要的痛苦。類此性質者更不知多少。　　其次，談到戰爭，現代戰爭是全民戰爭，是總力戰爭，又是生產戰爭，換方之，就是每個人民各自緊守崗位發揮所有力量，貢獻於戰爭。所以，能生產才能戰爭，能生產才能協力戰爭。而目前的事實，適與增產相反，隨時隨地妨礙生產，甚至人民生活必需品也不能維持最低限度的需要，那末，協力戰爭難免有空口侈談之嫌了。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　帛琉羣島及摩羅泰島之戰況如次：培里琉島方面，日軍部隊二十五日對於攻入飛機塲北方日軍陣地之美軍，仍展開反攻中，向帛琉島東北方哥斯緊爾水道來攻之敵艦艇，侵入培里琉島東方魯特爾碼頭，自二十五日晨以來開始登陸。又機塲附近續有增援部隊登陸，是日下午，西海岸方面敵軍，以戰車二十輛爲前鋒向前猛攻，日軍部隊正予以邀擊，展開激戰中。安格維爾島上空，二十五日終夜不斷有敵發射照明彈，敵艦砲射擊極爲猛烈，該島之日軍刻正以寡兵奮戰，極力反攻。二十五日晨培里琉島，安格維爾島周圍海面發現敵第五艘大型病院船，戰敵軍死傷兵士駛去。敵於太平洋海上島作戰中，如此以病院船收容死傷兵士，此次尚屬創見，敵於培里琉，安格維爾兩島以北損失之重大，由此可見。帛琉羣島及哥羅爾島方面，日軍守備部隊之邀擊態勢業已完成，日軍將士見敵必殺之意氣，極爲昂揚，正有承而待敵登陸。麾奈泰島方面，二十五日判明日軍邀擊戰果，據日軍突入敵中生還者所確認，敵棄屍三百具以上，傷三百人以上，除此以外，日軍未歸還者，予敵之損害亦相當重大，迄目前止，日方損失爲陣亡四人，未歸還若干人，正繼續作肉彈突進，展開激戰。　　東京二十八日中央社電　培里琉島敵自二十六日夜以來，即以多數登陸用舟艇實施登陸作戰，並逐次增強兵力，圖由該島西方海面及加爾得羅爾克碼頭附近進至北方，刻正由日守軍激戰中。敵軍一部，會在戰車四輛掩護下，侵入該島北部地區，刻日守軍正與之邀擊中。　　東京二十八日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電，日空軍會於二十七日空襲培里琉敵軍陣地，使受重創，日機則安返基地，西海岸敵登陸地戰，因日軍轟炸所起之火災，於數十里之海面上空，亦能望見。據空中偵察，日守軍於該島西北部丘陵地帶構築陣地，依然繼續奮戰中，日章旗亦能清楚望見，西南隅飛機塲南部集結之敵兵，因遭日機猛烈轟炸，似已發生動搖。</p>

<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　擴重慶消息，傳渝方數月內將改組。現官長中最不受歡迎者，文官爲孔祥熙，武官爲何應欽。此次改組之動機，乃因日前舉行之國民參政會之非難，該會席間會非難財政部孔祥熙，故其被免職之推測，似有可能。至於軍政部長兼參謀總長何應欽之動搖，內幕想不簡單。另據重應電報稱，此次改組之背景，乃爲分擔對日完成戰爭之責任，因之軍首腦部之更迭乃屬必要。何應欽乃自力抗戰派之巨頭，對延安取強硬態度，爲依存美國派之矢之，　美國對重慶內政有發言　時，何應欽之存在，有碍於渝共之合作，終不免被淘汰云。</p>

<p>儘管公司方面盡力爲工人謀福利，然在許多工廠內，飛機工人雖不見減少，但勞働者的約百分之六十三爲女子，徵兵不合格者，及老人，且這工作能率低下的人數，不斷增加。美國目前最大的問題，是發見[直接]勞働的熟練工；即直接會製造飛機的人。不是穿着雪白硬領的事務員般[間接]勞働。從一九四一年一月起至四二年八月，選拔徵兵局從西海岸的工廠徽募了六萬六千名的熱練工。今更徵集了五萬八千名。這約當勞働力的五分之一。這五萬八千名工人，在普通狀態中，每月生產轟炸機戰鬥機約八百架，故生產上的實際損失極巨，蓋被徵募的人，大部分是熟練工，他們的工作勢必交代與別人。而替代者不能不是女子，身　有缺陷者及老人。結果，這些人們決不能像前任者一樣敏速而有能率。　　美國最大的飛機公司之一道格拉斯公司聲稱：　　[徵兵局的選拔，限制了道格拉斯公司所能建造的飛機數量。第二次換人計劃更使生產減低。]　　最後提議將現在的設施更機械化，以彌補人數的減少。但機械的生產力也快到限度。去年上半期的六個月間，建造一架飛機所需要的勞働時間，減低三十三%，在軍用機的製造上，減少了多少勞働時間，無從獲悉。然而製造新機械也需要人力。據代表西海岸人工廠的飛機戰時生產審儀會之一般意見：　　[徵兵計劃在目前的標準下，即欲維持現在的生產，亦不可能，更談不到增產了。]</p>

<p>— 本報特派員劉漢儒</p>
<p>浙東與上海地區間的交通，平時端賴滬甬航綸，寗紹人士，往返滬甬，一登輪船，祇需時一夜，即可到達目的地，毫不感覺困難。不過在戰時交通不便，滬甬航運，時行時輟。浙省當局，有鑒於此，逎設法整頓浙東公路，期以公路補助海航，開闢自杭州至寗波之幹綫，由華中鐵道公司，兼營公路客貨運輸，業於九朋三日正式營業。上海各報社記者爲欲明瞭此一公路綫之實況，特各派記者合組視察團，得華鐵援助，前往視察，往返費時八日，對於沿綫情況，已得梗槪。此處謹將記者人在沿綫之觀感，擇要叙述，以告讀者。</p>
<h3 id="c35">○杭甬公路的現狀 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>杭甬公路起點是杭州南星橋對江的江邊碼頭，終點是寗波。由江邊碼頭起，經過西興·東西興·蕭山縣·轉壩·莫家港·吟龍閣·衙前·錢清·秦望·阮社·柯橋·彌陀寺·尊儀橋·西郭門·紹興·島埠·陶堰·東關·曹娥江口·渡江由百宮經驛亭·五夫·馬渚·餘姚縣·蜀山·丈亭·葉家·慈谿縣·洪塘·莊橋等處達寗波。全綫計長一百五十九公里。　　公路客運票價，每公里約七元左右，現分四段售票，江邊至蕭山十公里票價約七十元，自蕭山至紹興四十一公里票價約三百二十餘元，紹興至曹娥江三十一公里約二百二十元左右，百官至寗波計七十七公里，約五百四五十元。自杭州江連至寗波全部票價共約一千一百餘元。蕭山至紹興每日上午下午各有一班車相對開山，紹興至曹娥經百官達寗波，每日有一班車對開。蕭山紹興間除華鐵直營公共汽車外，尚有私人經營之小包車營業，票價則較華鐵定價高出一倍以上，每人須六百元至八百元，可坐六人至八人，包一車約費五千元至六千元。</p>

<p>如旅客欲從上海取道浙東公路往寗波者，其大槪行程如下：第一日乘七時半上海北站發之火車，下午一時半抵杭州，宿杭州。第二日晨乘車往閘口渡錢塘江轉公路車至蕭山，在蕭山進午膳，下午二時左右車發紹興，四時前可達紹興，宿紹興。第三日晨八時左右由紹興出發，午前抵曹娥江，渡江爲上處縣處之百官，在此午餐並候由寗波開來之車，下午二時左右車發寗波，約五時前到達。共需時三日，由寗波來滬，亦同樣費時三天。　　公路沿綫各區·雖有游擊隊及土匪盤踞，但行旅可不必担憂，因沿綫治安除由各區保安隊負責外，爲謹愼起見，每次車並有盟邦軍隊隨車沿途保護，故行車迄今，毫無事故發生。　　公路路基是利用舊公路及杭甬鐵路路基修築而成，全路路面，尚稱平穩，惟由百官至寗波間之橋樑，大都臨時搭成，不能載重，有數處旅客須下車步行，讓空車開過。</p>

<p>吾人對於杭甬公路，以爲有三點，當局必須加以注意：　　第一·治安問題　杭甬公路沿綫治安，必須強化，正規軍及保安隊應具備完全警衛全綫能力，不應倚賴盟邦軍隊隨車保護，同時轄境各縣之警備，亦應加強，通力合作，以維安全。　　第二·義路問題　修築橋樑，保養路面，是杭甬路目前之急要工作，省建設廳應研究對策，令飭各縣組織護路隊，分段負養路之責，一面並令飭技工人員，籌集材料，修建堅固橋樑，尤其對於護路隊之組織，爲刻不容緩之事，護路隊組織完備，則公路可永遠保持良好，不致有中止行車之虞。　　第三·輸運力問題　現在杭甬路僅有卡車四輛，客車兩輛以及私家經營之小包車數輛，運輸力實太薄弱。在治安問題及養路問題解決之後，浙東省當局及華中鐵道公司宜速謀強化此一公路之運輸力，增撥車力，擴大運輸，以應客貨運輸之迫切需要。　　浙東地區在戰事現階段上，居重要地位，杭甬公路之運動，不僅寗紹人士寄予重大期待，即全和平區中外人士亦極重視，深盼浙省當局予以注意，務使此一公路綫能負起浙東與滬寗間陸上交通之重大責任。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Avoiding Unnecessary Suffering <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed Confucius as a great statesman whose political philosophy rested on [winning the hearts of the people]. He first sought social stability, and then he was able to achieve the complete submission of the people. He started with the two points of [not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about instability] to seek [equality] and [stability] in society. He further used the active spirit of [forgetting to eat when working hard, forgetting worries with joy, not knowing that old age is coming] to seek the realization of his ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, the way to govern is to win the hearts of the people, which has been a principle of governance in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. It can also be said that those who win the hearts of the people will see their country flourish, and those who lose the hearts of the people will see their country decline, which has been a law of history for any country. In Confucius' time, the state was a monarchy, centered on the ruler, but still emphasized the importance of the people's hearts, because [the people are the foundation of the state]. If the people are not valued, then a country without people cannot stand in the world, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>As Mr. Li, the chairman, said in his speech at the inaugural meeting of the China News Association a few days ago: [China is a 'Republic,' and the Chinese government is a 'National Government.' Some even say that 'officials are servants of the people.' Therefore, both objectively and subjectively, the interests of the people must be given top priority, especially the suffering of the people, which should be pointed out in detail, tirelessly seeking details, and prompting relevant parties to pay attention to improvement.] China has always been based on the people as the main body, so the interests of the people should naturally be given even greater importance. Therefore, the object of politics must be the interests of the people. The government is originally a rigid machine, but the active part is the rulers in the government. Therefore, the rulers should go deep into the people. Although they cannot always personally experience the lives of the people, they should at least always pay attention to the suffering of the people and always listen to the opinions of the people. With the feeling of "treating the drowning of others as if one were drowning, treating the hunger of others as if one were hungry," they should plan ways to alleviate the suffering of the people. This is what it means to win the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>However, we are currently at war. The lives of the people in a country at war cannot be compared with peacetime. The lives of the people at war mean enduring hardship and increasing the burden. Indeed, this is a natural and inevitable thing. However, we must also understand that there should be a limit to enduring hardship and increasing the burden. In order to benefit the war and strive for victory, we should grit our teeth and endure hardship in any environment. However, increasing unnecessary burdens and enduring unnecessary suffering in the name of war not only does not benefit the war but also hinders it, because unnecessary suffering is very likely to increase the resentment of the people, which invisibly reduces the potential for victory. Therefore, the rulers should do their best to avoid unnecessary suffering for the people. For example, black market rice at 12,000 yuan per stone is an unnecessary suffering. If the rulers manage the rice policy well, the black market price of rice would not be so high. Another example is the black market for train and ship tickets, where the value is several times higher than the ticket price, even though there is a nominal price, it is impossible to buy tickets. These are all unnecessary sufferings. There are countless others of this nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, talking about war, modern war is a total war, a war of all forces, and a war of production. In other words, every person must stick to their posts and exert all their strength to contribute to the war. Therefore, only with production can there be war, and only with production can there be cooperation in war. However, the current reality is the opposite of increasing production. Production is hindered anytime and anywhere, and even the necessities of life for the people cannot maintain the minimum needs. In that case, cooperation in the war is inevitably just empty talk.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Has Completed Interception Preparations in the Palau Islands, and the Japanese Army is Fighting Bravely with a Small Number of Troops on Angaur Island <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Palau Islands and Morotai Island is as follows: In the Peleliu Island area, the Japanese army units launched a counterattack on the US troops who had invaded the northern Japanese army positions near the airfield on the 25th. Enemy warships attacking the northeast Koskel Channel of Palau Island invaded the Rutel Wharf east of Peleliu Island and began landing since the morning of the 25th. In addition, reinforcements continued to land near the airfield. In the afternoon, enemy troops on the west coast, with 20 tanks as the vanguard, launched a fierce attack. The Japanese army units are intercepting them and engaging in fierce battles. In the skies over Angaur Island, enemy flares were continuously fired throughout the night of the 25th, and enemy naval gun fire was extremely fierce. The Japanese army on the island is fighting bravely with a small number of troops and doing its utmost to counterattack. On the morning of the 25th, the fifth large enemy hospital ship was discovered in the waters surrounding Peleliu Island and Angaur Island, and it sailed away with the enemy's dead and wounded soldiers. This is the first time that the enemy has used hospital ships to collect dead and wounded soldiers in island warfare in the Pacific Ocean, which shows the heavy losses suffered by the enemy north of Peleliu and Angaur Islands. In the Palau Islands and Koror Island areas, the Japanese army's defensive forces have completed their interception preparations, and the Japanese soldiers are in high spirits, determined to kill any enemy they see and waiting for the enemy to land. In the Morotai Island area, the results of the Japanese army's interception battle were determined on the 25th. According to survivors of the Japanese army who broke into the enemy's ranks, the enemy abandoned more than 300 corpses and more than 300 wounded. In addition, the losses inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese army who have not returned are also quite significant. To date, the Japanese side has lost 4 killed and a certain number of missing. They are continuing to make flesh-bomb attacks and engaging in fierce battles. Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the night of the 26th, the enemy on Peleliu Island has been carrying out landing operations with a large number of landing craft and gradually increasing its forces, attempting to advance northward from the western sea area of the island and the vicinity of the Garderoluk Wharf. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison. A part of the enemy forces, under the cover of four tanks, invaded the northern part of the island. The Japanese garrison is currently intercepting them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a base in the central Pacific, the Japanese Air Force raided enemy positions on Peleliu on the 27th, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese planes returned safely to base. The fires caused by the Japanese bombing of the enemy's landing site on the west coast could be seen even in the sky dozens of miles away. According to aerial reconnaissance, the Japanese garrison has built positions in the hills in the northwest of the island and is still continuing to fight bravely. The Japanese flag can also be clearly seen. The enemy troops gathered in the south of the airfield in the southwest corner have been shaken by the fierce bombing by the Japanese planes.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Foreign Minister's Broadcast Address <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu made an exchange broadcast with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 7:20 pm on the 27th at the Tokyo Broadcasting Station. The text is as follows: The world war situation has now entered a decisive stage. The people of Germany and Italy are united in spirit and are exerting all their strength to fight with the belief in certain victory. The people of Japan are full of admiration. At present, Japan is also rising up, determined to bravely advance on the road to final victory. Furthermore, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly apparent as the war situation enters a decisive stage. Their demands are actually to conquer the world, dominate the world, and make themselves the masters of the world. Their intention is to establish the right to dominate, monopolize the world's resources, and obliterate the existence of the Axis powers. We are fighting to the death to realize the lofty ideals of the Tripartite Pact. Our goal is to ensure that all ethnic groups and countries in the world can find their place, which can only be realized on the basis of lasting world peace. The immense sacrifices of mankind can only have meaning if they contribute to the realization of this ideal. This is our firm belief. The enemy's counterattack is now extremely fierce, and we believe that political strategies will also become more and more important day by day. Our Japan, Germany, and Italy, together with our European and Asian allies, must further consolidate our unity, be aware of the significance of this war, and muster the determination to fight to the end no matter what difficulties we face.</p>
<h3 id="e5">German Foreign Minister's Broadcast Address <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made an exchange broadcast with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the morning of the 27th. The text is as follows: Today is the fourth anniversary of the conclusion of the pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and their allied countries. Fierce defensive battles are being waged on all fronts. The anti-Axis forces have now approached Germany from the east, southeast, and west, while our friendly country Japan is preparing to meet the frontal offensive of the anti-Axis forces in East Asia with powerful forces. The entry of the war into this serious stage is indeed a good opportunity to hone the soldiers and people of the three countries. Therefore, the existence of the nations, homelands, and thousands of years of traditional culture, customs, and habits of the allied countries depends on the outcome of this war. If we make a mistake, the consequences will be worse than anyone can imagine. Recently, the enemy has been loudly proclaiming that they will obliterate the three allied countries and enslave them. The only way for us to eliminate the enemy's arrogant attitude is to gather all our strength and fight them. This is a fact that the people of the three countries are well aware of. Our only path is to advance forward with a spirit of no compromise, no surrender, and fighting to the end.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Rumors of Chongqing Restructuring Within Months <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Expanding on Chongqing news, there are rumors that Chongqing will be restructured within months. The most unpopular officials among the current officeholders are Kong Xiangxi among the civil officials and He Yingqin among the military officials. The motivation for this restructuring is due to the criticism at the recent National Political Council. During the session, the council criticized Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance, so the speculation that he will be dismissed seems possible. As for the shake-up of He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of Staff, the inside story is likely not simple. According to another Chongqing telegram, the background of this restructuring is to share the responsibility for completing the war against Japan, so the change of the military leadership is necessary. He Yingqin is a major figure in the self-reliant resistance faction and takes a tough stance towards Yan'an, making him the target of the American-dependent faction. When the United States intervenes in Chongqing's internal affairs, He Yingqin's presence hinders cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists, and he will inevitably be eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japanese Air Force Intercepts US Planes Attacking Manchuria on the Mainland—A Total of 35 US Planes Destroyed— <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - A large formation of 80 to 90 B29 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing again attacked southern Manchuria on the 26th. At around 1:30 p.m., its main force invaded Anshan, and part of it attacked Dalian and Benxihu. The Japanese aircraft carried out interceptions, shooting down and destroying six of them. The Japanese air force destroyed fifteen enemy aircraft along the return route over the Chinese mainland and launched an attack on the enemy base near Chengdu that evening, destroying fourteen enemy aircraft. It can be imagined that the enemy aircraft lost a total of 35 aircraft during this operation, and the strike suffered can be imagined. The skies over Manchuria that day were covered with dense clouds, and the targets were unclear, so the Japanese air force launched a fierce interception, and the enemy aircraft immediately fled in a panic without achieving anything. The Anshan Iron and Steel Works was completely unharmed. The enemy aircraft also did not have time to drop bombs at Benxihu, and only the area near the Dalian Wharf suffered minor damage. The Japanese air force attacked and shot down two (not confirmed) and destroyed four of the enemy aircraft invading dense clouds, and then repelled them. The Japanese air force in China engaged in aerial combat over Guiding and Xinxiang on the enemy's route. They shot down two enemy aircraft (one not confirmed), destroyed one over Bawangcheng, shot down three and destroyed seven near Zhangde on the return trip, shot down one (not confirmed) near Yucheng (near Shaanxi Province), and destroyed one near Xinxiang. They shot down a total of six aircraft (two of which were not confirmed) and destroyed nine aircraft for a total of fifteen aircraft on the round trip. That night, the elite of the Japanese Air Force attacked the enemy air force base near Chengdu in spite of the bad weather. Under the resistance of enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire, they invaded the base and dropped sure-hit bombs, burning seven and destroying seven aircraft. The intensity of the interception and attack on this day was rare in recent times. However, Private Taguchi of the Japanese aircraft destroyed one enemy aircraft near Zhangde in aerial combat using a ramming tactic and returned to base injured. In this great victory, the Japanese aircraft lost only one aircraft, which is truly an unprecedented miracle.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Shortage of Skilled Workers <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Although companies are doing their best to improve the welfare of workers, in many factories, although the number of aircraft workers has not decreased, approximately 63% of the workers are women, draft failures, and the elderly. Moreover, the number of people with low work efficiency is constantly increasing. The biggest problem in the United States today is discovering skilled workers who [directly] labor, that is, people who can directly manufacture airplanes. Not white-collar office workers with stiff collars [indirect] labor. From January 1941 to August 1942, the Selective Service Bureau recruited 66,000 skilled workers from factories on the West Coast. Now, 58,000 more have been recruited. This accounts for about one-fifth of the workforce. Under normal circumstances, these 58,000 workers produce approximately 800 bombers and fighter planes each month, so the actual loss in production is enormous. Most of the people who are recruited are skilled workers, and their work must be handed over to others. And the replacements can only be women, people with disabilities, and the elderly. As a result, these people can never be as agile and efficient as their predecessors.</p>
<p>Douglas Aircraft Company, one of the largest aircraft companies in the United States, stated:</p>
<p>[The Selective Service Bureau's selection has limited the number of aircraft that Douglas Aircraft Company can build. The second round of replacement plans has further reduced production.]</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed to further mechanize the current facilities to compensate for the decrease in the number of people. However, the productive capacity of machinery is also nearing its limit. In the first six months of last year, the labor time required to build an aircraft was reduced by 33%. How much labor time has been reduced in the manufacture of military aircraft is unknown. However, manufacturing new machinery also requires manpower. According to the general opinion of the Aircraft Wartime Production Appraisal Committee, which represents the artificial factories on the West Coast:</p>
<p>[Under the current standards of the draft plan, it is impossible to maintain the current production, let alone increase production.]</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Plight of the Salaried Class <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The May issue of the American magazine "The American Mercury" features an essay by Senator Elbert Thomas of Utah, titled "Twenty Million Forgotten Americans." This article exposes the current situation of the so-called "white-collar workers" caught between rising prices and falling incomes. These forgotten twenty million are suffering hardships worse than punishment. The Senate's Education and Labor Investigating Committee stated the following:</p>
<p>[We must abandon the general assumptions held by some politicians. That is, everyone except those in military service cannot abandon the idea of living comfortably during this war. Evidence of this false notion is everywhere. Theaters, restaurants, hotels, and luxurious resorts are all full. Department stores, jewelry stores, and fur merchants are extremely busy. Black market transactions involving beef patties, whiskey, rayon underwear, gasoline, etc., continue unabated. The standard of living is rising, and at least millions of people cannot live stably. This is a fact. However, the wartime profiteering of a small number of people has created widespread wartime poverty. Before the Senate's Education and Labor Committee subcommittee recently investigated the salaried class, anyone would have thought it was a dream.]</p>
<p>The chairman of this subcommittee is Senator Claude Pepper, and the members are James M. Tunnell, Robert M. La Follette Jr., Kenneth S. Wherry, and Thomas. Skeptics say: [Indeed, many people's situations are deteriorating. But in 1943, the total personal income and expenditure amounted to approximately 142 billion dollars. No one talks about unemployment, everyone has a good job, and there are not that many people whose living standards are declining.] Are there really that few? I have undeniable evidence here, which is that twenty million Americans and their dependents have been using their increased income since Pearl Harbor to maintain a minimum standard of living. Their income is frozen, but on the one hand, taxes are increasing, and on the other hand, the cost of food, clothing, and housing is skyrocketing. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the increase in the cost of living since the start of the war is 22.4%. Philip Murray, president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), calls it 50%. The Senate committee admits that while the exact figures are unclear, the incomes of millions of Americans have actually decreased by 25% to 50%. In major cities, a salaried person needs an income of at least $50 per week to live. A single female office worker also needs $30 per week.

<h3 id="e22">Commemorative Significance <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Wu, the chief officiant, reported the significance of commemorating Confucius, stating in brief: Confucius has been sincerely worshipped by us for more than two thousand years because his academic thought does not change with the times. Confucius' personality, thought, and scholarship were sufficient to inspire the people of our Eastern nation two thousand years ago, and even today, they still have the power to move us. Looking at the extravagant social atmosphere and the tendency of youth to fall into decay today, not only should all colleagues take responsibility, but they should also use the academic spirit of our teacher Confucius to transform Shanghai society. Representatives from all sectors of the city should also share the responsibility and work together to implement it. Next, Mr. Zhao Zhengping gave a lecture, stating in brief that China is an ancient civilized country in the world, and Confucius' doctrine is to promote China's culture more than two thousand years ago. Confucius traveled to various places before the age of seventy, collecting documents from various places. After the age of seventy, he sorted out the documents he obtained. Confucius' doctrine can be divided into three points: ○Exhaustively investigate the principles of all things and promote spiritual knowledge, ○Cultivate the spirit of "benevolence and love," ○Promote world harmony. Also, it is reported that the Shandong Fellow Association held a grand autumn sacrifice ceremony at the Zhidao Tang Dacheng Pavilion of the association yesterday, presided over by Chairman Cui Jingsan, with all directors and supervisors as assistant officiants. More than 3,000 people, including members, students from Qilu primary and secondary schools, and guests, participated in the ceremony. The ceremony adopted classical methods and was extremely grand and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The New Asia First Restaurant, affiliated with the New Asia Company, in response to the Readers' Scholarship Fund campaign, jointly organized the "Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration" with this newspaper, the News Daily. Preparations have been completed. The movie stars and singers who will attend and sing include Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Bai Guang, Gong Qiuxia, Wang Danfeng, Chen Qi, Chen Juanjuan, Han Langan, Yin Xiucen, and others, as well as famous singers Yao Li, Ouyang Feilu, and more than ten others. Their singing and dancing will surely be a sensation. Such a grand event is rare in recent times. Recently, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been very active in purchasing tickets from the Shen News and the New Asia First Restaurant. It is reported that the colleagues and directors of the New Asia Company have already purchased hundreds of tickets, which shows the company's colleagues' concern for out-of-school youth. This can be a model for other enterprises. It is understood that the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration is purely organized by the New Asia Company in response to the scholarship movement to help out-of-school youth. The admission ticket is 1,000 yuan per ticket, and the New Asia First Restaurant will give a rich tea and refreshments and the Green Treasure Company will also add a serving of iced water. All income from the ticket sales, excluding any expenses, will be donated to the Shen News Scholarship Fund. Such a pragmatic public welfare act is a virtue of the company's service to society. However, it still requires people from all walks of life to generously contribute and actively purchase tickets in order to achieve the goal of completeness. For the price of one thousand yuan, you can not only enjoy high-quality entertainment, but also get exquisite gifts, and even help out-of-school youth. It is a win-win situation.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Miyamoto Morio Lectures on Current Educational Issues; Third Wartime Academic Lecture Held Yesterday <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The third wartime academic lecture jointly organized by this newspaper and the News Daily invited Mr. Miyamoto Morio, a Japanese youth education expert and design committee member of the Nanjing General Assembly of the National New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee, to speak. Mr. Miyamoto recently gave two lectures at Yucai Middle School and the Industrial and Commercial Association to middle and primary school teachers and university and middle school students on youth education issues. Yesterday (28th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, he again lectured on current educational issues to more than 40 university professors in this city at the Industrial and Commercial Association. The main points are recorded as follows: Miyamoto's Speech: [Today is the birthday of our teacher Confucius, and I feel very honored to be able to discuss educational issues with you here. Especially since I am also a scholar who has received Confucian education, the significance is even greater. Education is the foundation of national prosperity. I think you all have this belief. The status of Japan and Germany today can also be said to be the result of education. As for the two words "education", what do they mean? According to the Doctrine of the Mean, "What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature; an accordance with this nature is called the Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction." It can be seen that the education referred to by the Eastern people is the meaning of cultivating the Tao. However, Westerners have this explanation: "Education is the work of transmitting and expanding culture, and it is also the work of making each person a complete person in society." Summarizing these two statements, we can come to a conclusion, that is: "Education is the work of cultivating and nurturing successors of the country and nation." Because human life is limited, and the life of the country and nation is infinite, we naturally cannot ignore the work of cultivating successors. I personally have a few hopes for education, that is, it is best to be directly operated by the state, and education should not be regarded as an enterprise. At the same time, people in society should not completely push this responsibility to the state, but should try their best to ensure that our nation has the opportunity to receive education. The policy of equal educational opportunities advocated by various countries in modern times is the popular reason for the above-mentioned concept. Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, education has been very developed. Except for those with physical defects, children have the opportunity to enter national schools, so the enrollment rate of school-age children reaches 99.3%, which is the highest in the world. Since the Nazis came to power in Germany, they also regarded equal educational opportunities as one of the twenty-five policies. In addition to enriching school education, Germany also has youth group organizations throughout the country. The rich have the obligation to donate uniforms and other expenses to the members. This not only popularized youth education, but also added a layer of concern for education to adults. I think that the distance between the rich and the poor in China is too great, and most of the rich are indifferent to education. It is really of double significance for you to run education in such a difficult environment, that is, in addition to cultivating the successors of the country and nation, there is also a profound meaning of awakening the public's awareness of education. There is a Japanese saying called "preaching to Sakyamuni." My lecture today to you actual working educators is really superfluous, please forgive me, and I wish you all success.]</p>
<h3 id="e34">Inspection Record of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liu Hanru</p>
<p>Traffic between eastern Zhejiang and the Shanghai area usually relies on the Shanghai-Ningbo sea route. People from Ningbo and Shaoxing only need to board a ship for one night to reach their destination without any difficulty. However, during wartime, transportation is inconvenient, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is sometimes available and sometimes not. In view of this, the Zhejiang provincial authorities tried to rectify the eastern Zhejiang highway, hoping to supplement sea navigation with the highway and open up a main line from Hangzhou to Ningbo. The China Railway Company also operated passenger and freight transportation on the highway, which officially opened on September 3rd. In order to understand the actual situation of this highway line, reporters from various Shanghai newspaper offices formed an inspection team with the assistance of China Railway and went to inspect it. The round trip took eight days, and they gained a general understanding of the situation along the line. Here, I would like to briefly describe the reporter's impressions along the line to inform readers.</p>
<h3 id="e35">○The Current Situation of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The starting point of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is the riverside pier on the Jiangbian side of Nanxing Bridge in Hangzhou, and the ending point is Ningbo. Starting from the riverside pier, it passes through Xixing, Dongxi Xing, Xiaoshan County, Zhuanba, Mojia Port, Yinlong Pavilion, Yaqian, Qianqing, Qinwang, Ruan She, Keqiao, Maitreya Temple, Zunyi Bridge, Xiguomen, Shaoxing, Daobu, Taoyan, Dongguan, Cao'e River Estuary, and crosses the river to Baigong, then passes through Yiting, Wufu, Mazhu, Yuyao County, Shushan, Zhangting, Ye Jia, Cixi County, Hongtang, Zhuangqiao, and other places to reach Ningbo. The entire line is 159 kilometers long. The highway passenger fare is about seven yuan per kilometer. Tickets are currently sold in four sections. The ticket price for the ten kilometers from Jiangbian to Xiaoshan is about seventy yuan, the ticket price for the forty-one kilometers from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing is about three hundred and twenty yuan, the thirty-one kilometers from Shaoxing to Cao'e River is about two hundred and twenty yuan, and the seventy-seven kilometers from Baiguan to Ningbo is about five hundred and forty-five yuan. The total fare from Hangzhou Jiangbian to Ningbo is about 1,100 yuan. There is one bus each morning and afternoon running in opposite directions between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. In addition to the public buses directly operated by China Railway between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing, there are also small chartered buses operated by private individuals. The fare is more than double the price set by China Railway, requiring 600 to 800 yuan per person. A car can seat six to eight people, and chartering a car costs about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e36">○The Journey from Shanghai to Ningbo <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>If passengers want to take the eastern Zhejiang highway from Shanghai to Ningbo, the general itinerary is as follows: On the first day, take the train departing from Shanghai North Station at 7:30 AM and arrive in Hangzhou at 1:30 PM in the afternoon and stay in Hangzhou. On the second day, take a bus to the Zhakou Ferry to cross the Qiantang River and transfer to a highway bus to Xiaoshan. Have lunch in Xiaoshan and leave for Shaoxing by bus around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Arrive in Shaoxing before 4:00 PM and stay in Shaoxing. On the third day, depart from Shaoxing around 8:00 AM in the morning and arrive at Cao'e River before noon. Cross the river to Baiguan, which is the jurisdiction of Shangyu County. Have lunch here and wait for the bus coming from Ningbo. Depart for Ningbo by bus around 2:00 PM in the afternoon and arrive around 5:00 PM. It takes three days. It also takes three days to come to Shanghai from Ningbo. Although there are guerrillas and bandits entrenched in various areas along the highway, travelers do not need to worry. In addition to the security teams in each area being responsible for security along the route, the Allied forces also accompany the bus along the way for protection. Therefore, no accidents have occurred since the bus started operating. The roadbed of the highway is built using the old highway and the Hangzhou-Ningbo railway roadbed. The road surface of the entire road is relatively smooth. However, the bridges from Baiguan to Ningbo are mostly temporarily built and cannot carry heavy loads. In several places, passengers must get off the bus and walk, allowing the empty bus to pass.</p>
<h3 id="e37">○Three Points to Note <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway, we believe that there are three points that the authorities must pay attention to: First, the issue of security. Security along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway must be strengthened. Regular troops and security teams should have the full ability to guard the entire line and should not rely on Allied forces to protect the bus along the way. At the same time, the security of the counties under its jurisdiction should also be strengthened to cooperate fully to maintain security. Second, the issue of road maintenance. Building bridges and maintaining the road surface are the urgent tasks of the Hangzhou-Ningbo road. The Provincial Department of Construction should study countermeasures and order various counties to organize road maintenance teams to be responsible for road maintenance in sections. At the same time, technicians should be ordered to collect materials and build solid bridges. Especially the organization of road maintenance teams is a matter of urgency. With the complete organization of road maintenance teams, the highway can always be kept in good condition and there will be no risk of suspending traffic. Third, the issue of transportation capacity. At present, there are only four trucks, two passenger buses, and a few small chartered buses operated by private individuals on the Hangzhou-Ningbo road. The transportation capacity is too weak. After the security issue and the road maintenance issue are resolved, the Zhejiang Provincial Authority and the China Railway Company should quickly seek to strengthen the transportation capacity of this highway, allocate more vehicles, and expand transportation to meet the urgent needs of passenger and freight transportation. The eastern Zhejiang region occupies an important position in the current stage of the war. The operation of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is not only of great expectation to the people of Ningbo and Shaoxing, but also highly valued by Chinese and foreigners in the entire peace zone. It is hoped that the Zhejiang provincial authorities will pay attention to it and ensure that this highway line can bear the important responsibility of land transportation between eastern Zhejiang and Shanghai and Ningbo.
