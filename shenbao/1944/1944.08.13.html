<h3 id="c1">唯有誓死殺敵 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>我們首先馨香祈禱於小磯米內聯合新內閣者，即所謂「一變則通」的內閣。耗費無數心血，好容易更迭的內閣，假如與前內閣，軌粗一轍，毫無變化，則不僅失去更迭的意義，且有多此一舉之嫌。我認爲內閣更迭後，則人心一新，濁足廓淸，正如導停滯之水於萬丈深淵，舉所有的新銳朝氣，以備戰勝敵人。唯有這種決心和信念，方能副小磯米內兩大將拜命的初衷。我們日本一億國民，深信不疑，刮目以待。</p>
<p>凡聽到授命小磯陸軍大將米內海軍大將組閣消息，而不作異常感奮者，恐怕百無一人。一八八五年第一次伊藤組閣以來，迄至今日，內閣更迭已達四十一次之多，但其中授命二人組閣者，只有一八九八年大隈板垣內閣和此次。就是說，四十一次內閣更迭中，只有兩次。但授命大隈和板垣共同組閣的理由，乃當時大隈領導的在野黨和板垣領導的在野黨合流，共同抨擊伊藤內閣的結果，於是伊藤公上奏兩人共同組織。然該內閣，不幸四閱月而短命夭折。原因是大隈和板垣自始至終各自爲政，貌合神離，勾心鬥角，終於倒台。歷屆內閣，平均年齡固屬一年有半，但大隈板垣內閣，只不過其平均年齡的四分之一。然此次小磯米內兩大將，不僅必須各自熟慮陸海兩軍的立塲，並且要深加認識，陸海兩軍爲大元帥陛下指導下的眞正日本皇軍，所以要共同一致，如常山之蛇，首尾相應，綏急相助，一心一德，全始全終，是所至盼。</p>
<p>我們所期待於新內閣者，只是一切都致力於戰事一點。如果有人問是爲什麽的內閣？則回答是爲戰爭的內閣。至於問是爲什麼而戰爭？則回答是爲勝利而戰爭。不勝的戰爭，是無用的戰爭。戰爭旣然爆發，也只有貫澈戰爭到底。就是說，此次內閣必須是絕對完成大東亞戰爭的內閣。關於這一點，我們一億國民必須衷心支持這一內閣的政策，必須幫助內閣。</p>
<p>更有進者，即必須自省一事。西鄉南洲固然曾說過：「有功則讓人，有過則歸己」，但今日之世態人情，却不幸與此相反。功勞，則甚至搶他人者爲己有；過錯，則善於諉諸他人，這就是今日一般人的作風。如是，想完遂大東亞戰爭，眞是戞乎其難。因此，全體國民，即軍官民三位一體，都要乘此機會，强調這一自省的必要。在今日，有因傷及船舶而自殺的船長，也有因未能如期完成發明而自刎的技師。談至皇國軍人，更有無數重視責任的將士。實令吾等五體投地，感謝莫名。但一方面有這樣崇高自持的日本男子，而另一方面辱及日本人者，也不是沒有。所以在上位者，必須以身作則，三省己身。</p>
<p>一般說來，今日最需要人和。孟子也曾證過：「天時不如地利，地利不如人和」；極端言之，今日的需要，與其說是兵器增產或食糧增產，勿寗說是人和增產。如人和充溢於全國，則兵器自然可以增產，食糧也自然可以增產。但如缺乏人和，則任何督責鼓勵，亦難生效。使人工作，則需要威力與財力。但如不能使人心悅誠服，則無論給錢多少，無論規定如何嚴厲法令加以懲處，仍不能見諸有效實行。最重要者，是使人心悅誠服。就是說，爭取人和。爲達此目的，則爲政者第一要信賴國民，第二要敬重國民，第三要聽取國民之聲，第四要停止官僚本位政治，而實施國民本位政治。這四點，決非今日新發明的杜撰，而是日本皇國傳統上的爲政要諦，甚至世所詬病的叛逆北條泰時，尙以爭取人和爲急務，而北　親房卿著的「神皇正統記」，曾大書特書地加以稱議。試舉目前一例，如軍需品工塲等，再加以認眞勞動的話，定還有增產的餘地。這一點，我認爲新任軍需大臣藤原銀次郎是比任何人都知道得淸楚。然而往往有不少人忽略這是與國家存亡有密切關係的事業，而只是追求利潤爲其行動的座右銘。如不改正這一點，無論怎樣獎勵產業戰士，無論怎樣微發壯丁工人，也不會完成欲期目的的。爲到述這一目標，單純空。說白話是無濟於事的，而爲政者必須以身作則。</p>
<p>最後必須指出者，即新內閣只有努力奮　，堅待到底。勝收是決定於時間的。無論勝，也無論收，都頑强支持下去，正如輔煦元帥所說，「我方左翼敗退，我方右翼覆滅，而我們只有突擊」，無論處在何種環境下，都必須向國民表示非突擊取勝不可的堅强決心。萬一爲政者示弱於人，則彩響及於國家和盟邦，是無可衡量的。唯其如此，我們在這一點上希望當局者，只有對我國人民表示堅强決心。再者，東條首相在二年又九月的長期怒濤濁浪上渡過，這是任何人不能不加以項禮摩拜的。至於他的功績，固然議論紛紜、莫衷一是；但他的勞苦，却是有口皆碑的。我們姑不談東條內閣，而談柬條首相，他本人始終滿腔熱血，具有非勝利不可的氣魄，只是這一點，我相信剛剛上任的小磯米內內閣，定會加以繼承。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本陸海軍部隊　七月份綜合戰果　墜毀敵機共一千零三十架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日大本營十二日下午三時三十分發表，日本陸·海軍部隊於七月內進攻敵軍航空部隊與邀擊作戰之綜合戰果如下：　予敵損失，南太平洋方面擊落八十一架，擊毀六十架。中太平洋方面擊落一百五十四架，擊毀一百十二架。北太平洋方面擊落三架，擊毀二架。中國方面擊落八十架（不確者十七架），焚毀及擊毀四百七十五架。緬甸及印度洋方面擊落十九架，擊毀四十四架，總計一千三十架。　日軍損失，自炸未還者三十四架，地上損害一百零五架，總計一百三十九架。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　自敵軍企圖展開侵入作戰以來，大東亞各地域之航空戰，亦隨之激烈化，敵空軍於各戰塲動員之兵力亦行激增。按敵於六月中出動飛機約七萬兩千架，七月則爲三萬六千五百架，是即敵英美仗持物資，以空戰爲今後作戰方策之明證。反之，日軍則以孤兵或攻或守，勇敢應戰，擊滅敵機，已獲莫大戰果，計於六月中擊落或擊毀敵機一千四百六十架，七月爲一千零三十架，雖較六月戰果减少四百三十架，但比較五月尙多百二十架。日軍損失六月爲三百六十九架，七月則爲百三十九架，竟减二百三十架之多，此乃日軍航空部隊堅苦奮戰成果。又來襲各戰塲之敵機總數，因中部太平洋尼米資之攻勢加强，故七月份約一萬五千架，較六月多七百架。由此可知，敵攻擊馬利亞納羣島之猛烈。中國方面爲三千六百架，緬甸爲五千五百架，其航空兵力之大，由此可見一斑。尤其巾國方面日空軍，屢次反復轟炸桂林·柳州等駐渝美空軍之前進基地，計七月中擊滅敵機違五百五十五架，而予敵空軍以致命打擊，惟敵中印空軍路綫之補給，似在吾人預想以上，實不容輕視。綜觀中國戰錢動向及太平洋戰局之緊張，可知今後中國作戰意義之重大。</p>

<h3 id="c3">日大本營長發表　緬最近戰況　連結陣綫備次期作戰 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日大本營十二日發表緬甸最近戰況稱：緬甸戰況自入雨季之後，按普通軍事常識判斷，雙方行動，均當受天氣阻碍，但事賞上日軍能克服自然條件，渝英美聯軍擬打開來多公路，籍以增强對日軍作戰能力，日軍則始終以寡敵衆，忍受一切不利條件，與之勇敢奮戰，茲詰各地戰況如次：　南部印緬戰綫，日軍於布其頓，孟多一帶連結戰略要錢，堅持鐵弓陣形，戰事無大變化。　中部印緬國境，三月中旬開始之伊姆法爾作戰，五月來始終一進一退，無大進展，日軍之主動攻勢，已擊潰敵軍奪回緬甸之企圖，達成作戰主要目的，乃於八月自哥希馬及伊姆法爾地區，自動撒退至印緬國境之重要陣地錢，以備次期作戰。　北部緬甸戰綫，自逾央美聯軍進攻北緬甸國境以來，日軍即於富貢地區展開激戰，因敵軍恃其補給關係，已越過日軍陣地兩側山地南下，日軍除予以重大打擊外，並逐向後退，現已抵達摩加溫西方緬甸鐵路北側新陣地，與敵對峙中。該方面敵軍係由渝軍兩師，空輸部隊一旅，西印軍兩旅組成，渝軍因受日軍痛擊，戰力消耗頗巨。密芝那方面，日軍於優勢敵軍包圍下，孤兵奮戰，達二月之久，卒於八月三·三兩日夜間突破敵重圍，向後方撒退。當時日軍守備隊長即命一低級將領指揮撤退作戰，自身則率少數部下與敵作最後決戰，終於壯烈戰死。日軍密芝那守備隊之奮戰情形，與敵陣營感動頗大，蔣介石氏曾以此勉勵部下。　怒江方面日軍，仍確保怒江西岸各要衝，挫折敵軍之攻擊，刻仍繼續粉碎敵開通滇緬公路之企岡。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日空軍　襲安康機塲 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>中國基地十二日日中央社電　十日午後九時半許，駐渝美空軍曾來襲廣州地區，但由於日軍嚴密之防空陣，未能侵入該地及其附近，即行　去。按渝美機此舉，似為空　日本土之牽制行為。</p>

<p>湖南前綫某基地十二日中央社電　桂林方面渝美軍藉渝印空路運輸而來之機械化部隊，爲奪回衡陽，於九日晨在寶慶衡陽公路之英陂附近，開始向衡陽附近結集包圍，有戰車四輛爲基幹之機械化部隊，及七千餘衆之兵力，日軍精銳爲一舉粉碎渝美軍頑固之反攻，自九日正午，開始行動，刻在衡陽西方地區，痛擊淪美軍之機械化部隊，壓迫衡陽西方九十公里之實慶云。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據重慶電，重慶軍當局頃發表謂，衡陽陷落前夜，第十軍軍長方先覺會致電蔣介石氏，表示　別。渝軍當局發表其文如次：蔣介石氏於八日晨，曾接得防守衡陽之第十軍軍長方先覺報吿一件，該報吿係於七日下午七時發出者，上有軍長方先覺及三師長之聯名，其內容如次：一日軍於今晟突入市內中心，目下正展開巷戰，職等決戰至最後一兵一卒，本軍人之天職與衡陽城共存亡，此次之報告或為最後之報告」云。</p>

<p>華鐵自規定旅客列車以後，上海站前，擁擠更甚，黑市車票，益見橫行，華鐵當局對避免擠軋及防止黑市率票，巳研討就緒，茲定八月十五日起，實行在車票上抄錄居住證號碼，以防轉賣，同時施行隔日售票以免擠軋，及防止黑市。茲誌其大要如次：</p>
<p>抄錄市民證號碼</p>
<p>車票上抄錄市民證號碼，旅客於購票時，日本人須向售票員出示領事館之居留民證，中國人須出示居住證，或市民證，使在車票背面，將其號碼抄錄，　車時，須將車票及上述證明書一併出示，以備檢查，如證明書號碼與車票上所記號碼不符，即認為黑市車票，拒絕乘車。至軍警購買車票時，加蓋「兵巒」印章，除穿制服者外，禁止使用，再東亞交通公社所售車票，亦同樣抄錄上述證明書之號碼。由上述辦法，如出高價向他人購得者，亦不准乘車，務希注意。又在車內或到達車站查票時，如發現車票上所記號碼與證明書之號碼不符，該票即作為無效，除補票外，並科予罰金。</p>
<p>前一日發售軍票</p>

<p>上海各紙廠所造之紙，以廢紙舊書破布廢花稻章篇主要原料，木漿等早已為高貴原料故不用，而破布製造手續較兼，且加電力限制，故用者較少，普通均逕以　紙與舊屬為原料，筆者與製紙業廢紙業中略有關係，每見舊書中發現數十年前絕版或社會上極難購到的名著，以及各書局的教科書（最多），或全新未用，或已用而批註甚多，或不完整者，佔廢紙中十之六。舊紙店將此糧名貴之書，以廢紙價收入，售與紙廠，紙廠　用女工，將此項好書撕散，便於打漿，如是造紙業雖以無用之廢紙，改造為各色可用紙張，但由舊書化為各色祗，須加碱料，漂粉，松香等原物料始可成所欲成之紙，再售與印刷業印刷各類書冊。然舊紙改造成新紙，其質當不及原來的堅固，再加其他次要原料物料人工煤電等開支，方可成新紙，印刷業再加印刷費，各項開支，是故成本當高，近加電力再行限制，紙業印刷業當不能盡量製印了，故莫怪紙貴書昂了。</p>

<h3 id="c34">大宮島空戰記 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>六月十一日，接獲敵機動部隊迫近的報告後，待機中的我航空部隊，立即起飛，開始在上空哨戒。午後〇時〇分，敵格拉曼戰鬥機數十架，出現於遙遠的上空。哨戒中的我戰鬥機見此，即從雲端一齊加以攻擊，敵方亦散開隊形，彼此混在一起，展開空中戰。地上砲火間對侵入〇〇島上空的敵機一齊開火。似石榴般的彈幕，打破了死一般的寂靜，包圍著逃　的敵機，出擊的飛機，不時爲補充燃料，彈藥而降陸。整備員在敵機攻擊下做著補給燃料，彈藥的荼。至〇時〇分，敵人遁走，　歸靜　。</p>
<p>此次空戰中，H少尉擊落敵格拉曼戰鬥機三架之多。惜因燃料著火而降落，同時，機體噴火，化爲火焰。更據談稱：</p>
<p>絕好天氣</p>
<p>從來沒有這種約好的攻擊天氣，可惜燃料著火。正想中途用降落傘降落時，機體已經著火燃燒了。正在那裏，在上空看見敵機，從雲端用俯視轟炸加以擊落，更在雲的隙縫間看見敵機越雲逃走，擊落其三架，但燃料槽可惜起火了。</p>
<p>態身高台瞭望空戰的記者，自親擊落敵機的狀況。「啊！出煙了！」「又　下去了！」在遙遠的水中敵機噴著黑煙墜落時，每次均大呼萬歲。六月十二日午前零時，又有敵格拉曼戰鬥機十數架來襲，接著，有戰鬥轟炸聯隊（艦戰機）不間斷的猛炸，機場，落中陣地，灰沙蔽天。我高角砲與機槍陣地對敵機加以砲擊，一機又一機的擊落下來。敵方所投的大多是三十公斤六十公斤的炸彈和　夷彈，有時亦有二百五十公斤的炸彈落下，這些炸彈中，定時炸彈半數以上，這大多是二小時至六小時後爆炸的。燒夷彈重約五公斤，七.八枚束在一起，一同投下，打穿屋面，地板，落在室內。待機於宿舍附近防空壕中的兵士，立即出來用濕席掩蓋，上面再澆水消火，故損害每次均極輕微，裏面也有僅擊穿屋頂者，略有若幹家屋，因遲慢而燒毀，但決不足恐。</p>
<p>一片火海</p>
<p>最討厭的是燒夷彈的引起野火。熱帶乾燥的野草，一經燃燒，山的一面即變成火海，賴南洋獨有的　雨，始能熄滅。</p>
<p>第三日自午前零時起，六時方過，即有七八十架大隊來擊，以四五十度角度作主‘俯衝轟炸，然而乘員的技術大多幼稚，據俘虜之言，繼戰機的乘員中，僅有飛行時間八十小時者，要轟炸的目的地，幾無一命中，繼戰機的炸彈投完後，即繼之以格拉曼戰鬥機的槍擊。</p>
<p>六月〇日，黑板上大書著聯合艦隊司令長官訓示的電報：</p>
<p>「第〇部隊指揮官，我方航空部隊開始總攻擊」</p>
<p>殺盡敵人</p>
<p>各隊長見了聯合艦隊司令長官的來電，更握緊了拳頭，漲紅著臉：「好！幹罷！必殺滅他們！」夕刻，隊長以下戰鬥指揮所獲得我方艦隊攻擊戰鬥機夕刻降陸飛行場的吉報。凖備夜間登陸的　導燈，亦完全在待機中。千後〇時，等待中的〇〇機，一架二架悠然地飛入滑走路，並立即向隊長報告戰果。隊長旁邊的各分隊士，也熱血沸騰，臉脹得通紅地在報告戰況。指揮所內一時充滿著血氣。陸續歸來的荒駕的報告，更興奮，互相握手慶祝。建功後的勇士們，略事假寐後，重行出發作黎明攻擊。記者見此出擊的狀態，叭在心底漸武運長久。這樣，由於連日的薄暮，黎明攻擊，命中必殺的魚雷，所獲戰果，如大本營所發表者，其背後常有海　們的實貴的血汗與生命。</p>
<p>見此敵機動部隊的來襲，敵人似乎缺少相當優秀的搭乘員。（譯自七月廿四日每日新聞）</p>
<p>日軍勇士猛攻</p>
<p>大宮島的戰鬥，依然極爲激烈。在該島西岸中央部的明石灣，及在西南部昭和彎登陸的敵軍，這日軍勇敢反攻，其進展大被阻滯。</p>
<p>恐懼日軍壯烈夜襲，拂曉戰的敵軍，常以戰車數輛前導，步兵則畏畏縮縮跟在後面前進。入夜，立即敷設地雷，以備日軍夜襲。但至二十三日，在上床兩地的中間半島登陸，二十四日，更開始在該島對岸的巷町登陸，迅速增強其兵力。且戰場上空常有飛機五六十架飛翔空中，阻止日軍地上部隊的白晝攻擊。</p>
<p>日軍對此自二十一日以來不斷實施夜襲，拂曉戰－－攪亂敵登陸地點，給與極大損害。尤以二十三日，誘引來慶昭和灣區日軍右翼陣地的敵戰車五輛至極近距離，加以壯烈反攻，三架被毀不能行動，其餘擊退。又於二十四日，對企圖前後二次在表半島南岸黑濱地區登陸的敵人，守備部隊步砲兵協同毅然加以邀擊，第一次，登陸用舟艇二艘，水陸兩用戰車二十輛中，擊沉其登陸用舟艇一艘，水陸兩用戰車十一輛，第二次，其登陸企圖均被　粉碎。</p>
<p>更於同日午後五時半，發見椗泊於昭和灣的一萬順級運輸船，用火砲向之射擊，命中二十七發，該船立即被濃煙包圍，發生大傾斜，向港外遠遁。雖不能確診其擊沉，但毫無遺憾的發揮了大砲奇襲的威力，士氣愈待軒昂。</p>
<p>響應中部太平洋侵略作戰的敵人，在印度洋方面亦蠢然欲動，二十五日，敵機動部隊迫近蘇門答臘的　本海而。敵人對薩本的出擊。自四月十九日以來，以爲第二次。其兵力比前次大爲增強，從該方面的侵略企圖，亦愈見熾烈。即二十五日午前，數艘巡洋艦，驅逐艦及潛水艦接近臨本港外，艦載機二十九架飛翔上空，實施轟炸，同時由艦艇砲擊。當地日軍奮起邀擊，擊沉驅逐艦二艘，潛水艦一艘，擊毀驅逐艦一艘，更擊落來襲敵機的大部，而擊退敵軍。</p>
<p>此次因敵軍來襲的損害，因第一線勇士的猛攻，極爲輕微，但太平洋方面的戰局，與該方面的敵軍侵略企圖，由須　予警戒。（譯自七月二十七日新聞）</p>

<p>黃家江離孝坪氏，在大東亞戰爭勃發的翌年五.六月的時候，曾滯留大宮島約一個半月，親接占領後不久的該島風物人情。茲聞大本營發敵兵二師團在該島開始登陸後，談其　憶如次：</p>
<p>「敵軍終於來了么？我軍將士不必說，居留僑胞想必也盡力奮鬥吧！」</p>
<p>說起明石灣，是大東亞戰勃發的翌日，即十二月九日，日軍道德登陸的地方。那裏立　當時某指揮官年親筆寫的「皇軍登陸之地」的可紀念的碑石。美國官署建築物之前，也有「激戰之地」的碑石。僑胞男子約僅三十人，皆係三十年前來該島者，或有農園，或營商業，相當成功，並傳及子孫。大東亞戰爭勃發後，均飲恨被監禁於牢獄，不數日，因日軍進駐而獲解放。其欣喜實不能言喻，從長期間的壓制中，今方感得生爲日本人之幸，奮袂而起，對我軍將士的　接，實出自衷誠。島田氏爲日本人會長，清水氏亦爲該島有力人士。餘曾日觀有約五十歲之澤田老婦者，廢寐忘餐，稿賞日軍，自茶湯的接待以至洗　，無微不至。此等人今日對敵兵的強行登陸，自將不願身家性命，協力皇軍。島民大都是西班牙人與土著的混血兒，使用美國言語，但氣質非常率直，皇軍占領後，與日本兵士非常親熟，孩童等常至警備隊遊嬉。日本語的片言斷句，亦牢記不忘，實出自衷心的與日本人親善。受長期間美式教育的此等孩童，亦沐日本的皇化，對於敵軍的來侵，他們將與日軍同抱同仇敵愾之心吧！（譯自七月二十四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c36">西歐前線的　立體化戰爭 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>德國的將士和從軍記者，從西歐前線回到巴黎，從速聯絡工作的，日見其多。記者每次都謀與這些勇士們會見，探聽前線的消息，下面就是蒐集的第一線報告。</p>
<p>海上的反攻</p>
<p>英美海軍現以機資茅斯和蘇桑普頓爲預點，控制西起瑟堡，東迄拉維爾兩港的四角形內的制海權。其側面的防衛，東邊爲英海軍的「華斯配特」「拉米裏斯」「奈爾遜」各三萬噸級的戰艦，並「格拉斯哥」，「奧萊盎」等巡洋艦五，六艘，驅逐艦十五艘，築成防壁；本文海面，則爲美國艦隊，計有三萬噸級的「奈維達」「何剛索」「台克撒斯」三戰艦，並巡洋艦，驅逐艦等，實力大抵與英海軍相等，在東西兩面築成鐵壁。其中間自英本土至現在侵入地區的海岸，敵悍然浮起浮標，築成十二道補給線，自由舴輸送船，此乃現在推進侵入作戰的敵軍的生命線。</p>
<p>大西洋防壁，並非使敵軍絕對不能侵入，不過假定侵入後，在作戰初期，掩護友軍的集中，以便縱容佈置攻擊的配備，對於這種軍事的目的，德海軍已盡十二分的使命。現在陸上軍隊的反攻戰，已進至第十階段。流星炸彈的爆碢英國本土，是此一戰斗開始的信號，以擊滅敵方補給方爲目標，協同海軍的攻勢，必須展開倒時期的親戰術。</p>
<p>敵方對於並無戰艦的德國海軍，預定於開戰三日間加以殲滅，對此，德國得勝高速度艇的奇襲戰法，加以應付，到處樹立戰果。</p>
<p>若以海上實力而觀，英美對德國的戰鬥，衆寡懸殊，無異三萬噸對一千噸的戰鬥，亦即三十五生的口徑砲對四生的口徑砲的戰鬥。但德軍切齒奮戰，在這優劣懸殊情形下，互相火併，大西洋要塞的德方海岸砲台，時時在一要塞內，與英國巡洋艦十艘交戰。</p>
<p>陸上的反攻</p>
<p>陸上的反攻戰，這兩週以來，陷於相當的苦境。因爲敵艦隊的威力常支配陸地。敵方在義在利登陸戰時，獲得經驗，即在艦砲射程以內，設立橋頭堡成功，　萊爾諾方面，德國戰車在離海岸兩公里地點，即受敵方的威脅，遂不得不與敵方的巡洋艦進行砲戰，因此陷於困境。在法國北部一手擔任防衛大西洋要塞的陸上部隊，有軍艦三十生的砲彈，飛至加恩與巴猶的南方，事實大砲戰亦無從進行。</p>
<p>但現在德國已發明流星炸彈，飛越英法海峽，直撲英國本土的心髒，這個消息，震動了全世界，德國殆將同時進行突擊，頗堪注目。據消息靈通的人士觀察，今後敵方的新攻勢，有趨向於塞納河起至索默河口間的可能性。</p>
<p>空中的反攻</p>
<p>空軍方面，德國各部隊，一齊再向倫敦展開轟炸，捷報頻傳，邀擊敵機必勝的陣營，益見強固。記者時常往巴黎郊外某地的列車高射砲陣地雲參觀。這個陣地用移動式的列車編成，有趣的是，乃得勝第一次世界大戰時　在法國的德國一所改造。</p>
<p>而且高射砲彈的速度，自今次大戰開始以來至今日，已增進百分之二十，現在　的每秒速度據說達三百公尺的三倍，實際即爲每秒九百公尺，而戰鬥每小時速度不過六百公里，每秒的速度不過一百六十公尺。因此德國的高射砲陣産生了百發百中的理論。（譯自六月二十七日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c37">諾曼第古今談 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>英吉利的海岸是絕壁，法國的北部也多絕壁，泛舟不易。選擇砂地的海岸的塞納灣登陸，也許是戰略家的常識，但邀碢的一方面，當然在砂地一帶充分戒備，因此雙方展開空前的大戰，其前途尚難預料。</p>
<p>六日的諾曼第，風光綺麗，盛開著頻果花朵。尤其是陰郁的冬季逝去，有半年時間，碧空如洗，收場嫩綠，鮮明地映在陽光下，令人心醉欲睡，這個美麗的諾曼第，現在繠淪爲決死的戰場了。從南國歸來，眷戀著諾曼第的燕兒們，不知將在休息營巢。</p>
<p>眷戀的諾曼第呀，</p>
<p>我的誕生之所……</p>
<p>這是喻炙世界的民謠</p>
<p>所謂「諾曼第」也者，因住著諾曼人（北方丹麥人）而得名。當公元十世紀前後，諾曼人　　偕北歐海盜南下，狂舉暴動，隨即就地下居，實行　婚，英國等更推舉丹人皇太子克奴特（海盜頭目）即王位，推行善政，頗著稱於史。</p>
<p>入十四世紀，百年戰爭開始。英國國王愛德華三世，爲遠征法國起見，派遣了射手一萬名，舟艇一千艘，敢然進行登陸戰，時爲一三四六年。登陸地點在拉法開，（即今加恩城附近）。當時內亂紛爭，諾曼第居民不知自衛之道，一任英軍蹂躪。結果英軍佔領加萊港，此後兩百年間，英國控制了英法間距離最近的兩端，確保杜佛海峽的制海權。悲劇「加萊的市民」，由來於此。羅丹的傑作「加萊的市民」，即今加萊城所在，增恨之情，蓋由來已古。</p>
<p>百年戰爭結束之後，英王享利五世，又迫隨乃祖父遺風，以大軍三萬，在今日亞福爾之西，塞納河河口的亞爾法爾襲動侵攻戰。其地點雺這次登陸戰相同。</p>
<p>諾曼第的住民，尚末更新換代先祖所賦北方民族勇敢的遺風。居民多從事複業，跨越北海驚濤駭浪，至遠洋捕魚的，都是諾曼第人，海軍人與船員，也以諾曼第人居多。</p>
<p>諾曼第的中心都市爲　昂，十七的大劇作家柯爾臬誕生於此，十九世紀的文豪福洛貝爾亦出生於此，實爲今人司令的城市。福洛貝爾傑作「波華荔夫人」就以該城爲描寫對象。</p>
<p>生在諾曼第，愛好諾曼第，小說的題材以諾曼第居多的莫泊桑，也是令人難忘的。生於柯奧地方，少年時代與百姓，漁夫之子，追逐於野原，或泛舟入海，樂遊忘返，及長卜居巴黎，在塞納河浮艇，複從恩師福洛貝洋演習寫作而成名。（譯自六月十八日號朝日週刊）</p>

<h3 id="c38">第三個孩子 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 朱麟</p>
<p>好容易挨到放工，阿金蒙着滿身的飛絮，雜在一大羣女工中從廠門裏踽踽地拖着大肚子被吐了出來。</p>
<p>疲倦中雜着頭　和腰酸，使他在同伴中落後時，卻正碰上了爭先前進的粗紗間的阿招。</p>
<p>「招弟！不成功呢！」阿金向招弟舉起了無力的救援的手。</p>
<p>阿招扶住了阿金的的手，放慢的步子。</p>
<p>「阿金姐，我看你日子近了，也該歇兩天等孩子下地啦！」</p>
<p>「做一天吃一天的，停下來吃什麽呀？」</p>
<p>「誰呌你和財福哥那麽熱絡的？」招弟扮了個鬼臉，在阿金手臂上捧了一把。</p>
<p>「死丫頭！」阿金也禁不住勉強地笑嗔了一下。</p>
<p>阿金拖着沉重的肚子走進家裏，軟癱似的坐上那張靠壁的三腳椅子，她開始覺得酸溜的採裏直痛到了小肚子。</p>
<p>她費力用力挺了挺腰，像是舒服了一點，但不一會，卻又來了更劇的痛楚，像海洋裏前浪推後浪似的一陣又國陣的湧來。</p>
<p>臨産的痛苦，自從嫁給財福以後，已經第三回窮折着阿金了，爲了生孩子吃點苦，阿金是經受得起的，但她恨男人的心腸，財福從沒有答允她留下自己用血肉包大的小孩子來，財福總是說：「自己也顧不了的䗛，不要給小冤家也活着受罪吧！」所以頭二兩個都是一下地連阿金男女都來不及分別時就被　包一塊破布擲到什麽垃圾桶的旁邊去了，阿金這一想就覺得自己挨受這痛苦都是冤枉的。</p>
<p>她咬緊了牙齒說着無聲的話：「這一回非留下不可。」</p>
<p>在朦朧的黃昏裏，財福提着飯格也從機器廠裏回來了，她看見老小躺在床上的樣子，就明白了那是什麽事情。</p>
<p>「快了吧！」</p>
<p>「痛得厲害呢？」是那麽戰憟的低音。</p>
<p>「讓我去喊老娘吧！」（老娘就是土法收生婆）</p>
<p>「不，等一會。」</p>
<p>阿金睜着眼睛望着她丈夫那張早已失去笑容的臉，真沒有通氣說出想留下孩子的話來，一陣更劇的像絞腸似的痛楚又襲來了。</p>
<p>「啊唷！」阿金慘呌着硬又挺了挺腰。</p>
<p>財福望着正在痛苦中煎熬的老婆，不由得也憐憫起來了，挨坐到那張硬板床上，撫着阿金那蓬亂的頭發。</p>
<p>「金弟，讓我去喊老太來吧？」</p>
<p>「不，財福！你肯不肯？」</p>
<p>「不要做夢吧！」財福沉默了半響才冷寒地說：「衹怪他們投錯了胎，窮苦人家是不能生養孩子的。」</p>
<p>「你做做好事吧！就留下這一個，下次再不生孩子了。」</p>
<p>「拿什麽來喂他，我沒有發財，我是個銅匠（即機器工人），你放明白點兒。」</p>
<p>這幾句無情的話在阿金聽來是冷酷極了，在財福自己呢？他也覺得要阿金第三回丟掉自己的孩子是太不應該了，第一回一個女丫頭，他若無所事的扔了，第二回一個男孩子，白白胖胖的丟在弄堂口時，連自己也真有點捨不得，也許是財富今年已經三十歲了，三十歲還不該有個小把戲伴伴熱鬧嗎？於是一張孩子的小臉出現在他面前，一對小而黑的圓眸子，紅闊的雙頰，……</p>
<p>一抹淡淡的空虛掠過他的心坎。</p>
<p>但，老婆的呌喊聲提醒了他，財富舉起雙手支撐著的頭來，一眼瞧見了阿金破褲子的洞眼裏露出的蒼白的大腿來，這使他想起了生活正像挨受緊抽着的鞭子，夫妻二個每天都　得做十二小時以上的工才換得勉強塞飽了肚子，那怎麽還能留下孩子來呢？何況，留下孩子來，阿金還能上紗廠雲做工嗎？誰說在那麽溫那塞點錢，孩子是可以帶進去的，但，多一張嘴要多一筆開銷，何況，又不能把孩子光着身子領大的。</p>
<p>「喔晴！」阿金又在挺着腰掙扎了，財福看了看那堆成一堆在蠕動着的老婆，歎了一口氣出門雲了。</p>
<p>當阿金肚子痛得從號喊而呻吟，又從呻吟而號喊祇　能用盡平生的力氣扭那床破棉被的時候，財福終於帶着週老娘回來了。</p>
<p>週老娘把一束苦草放在桌子上，伸手去探探阿金的肚子，衹咕嚨一聲：「快了。」</p>
<p>「還沒有燒水嗎？快點！」週老娘變着命令。</p>
<p>財福木然地在泥灶裏點起了火。</p>
<p>經過了三小時的辰光，孩子下地了，阿金到底看見了一個血紅的肥胖的男孩子，但她太累乏了，衹能半開着眼看週老娘收拾著孩子。</p>
<p>「快燒苦草水給她吃。」週老娘對財福努努嘴。</p>
<p>但財福先沒理他，在床底下拉出一條破褲子來。</p>
<p>「財福！」阿金掙扎着呌丈夫，但她像連說話的力氣都沒有，她無可奈何地掉過頭去，半身蒼白的　　的臉，一個急劇起伏的胸哺，代替了她的抗議。</p>
<p>「可憐可憐我吧！」像一縷游絲的輕微的語聲「丟了二個，還忍心丟第三個嗎，一個男的呢？」</p>
<p>財福被這輕輕的自語聲所激盪着，像是有了點心動了，可是他一瞥見週老娘那時等着收生錢的面孔就像抱着絕大的決心似的迅速地蹲下木桶去搬弄那小生命了。原來，他還沒有想到應該從什麽地方去弄到給週老娘的收生錢。</p>
<p>「你……」阿金總支的想豎起身來阻止他，怎奈，自己連動彈的力量都沒有。</p>
<p>「你…好……狠……心………」她頹然地倒下了衹　舉起了一點的頭。</p>
<p>財福沒有睬她，他急　地包了一塊血紅的肉　出去了。</p>
<p>阿金想哭，但是她覺得自己流不出淚水來，像有千萬枝針刺在她胸口似的，緊太着她的心坎。</p>
<p>「活着祇是受罪。」</p>
<p>她這麽深深地體味着了。</p>

<p>假使；那一天在他的嘴裏，不落出那一只小調，那末，我們誰都得留心一些，因爲；這時的老張，是往往會很容易尋着什麽事來發一下脾氣的！</p>
<p>但是：他發脾氣也並不一這《一要在老酒沒有吃得暢的時候，就是在老酒灌得暢而又暢，寗波人起飛前橄欖的小調也喊得老　的時候，但有時脾氣卻也照樣的會發那末一下的！</p>
<p>因爲：捉摸不定他發脾氣的時候，所以；我們就誰都得該留神一些－－不要惹動了他，而挨一下老拳。</p>
<p>黃湯灌飽了以後的老張，可勇敢得很哪！天不怕，地不怕，假使給他一把刀，也一定也會宰得人，因此：不論廠裏的什麽工程師，或者職員……都得遠他一步。</p>
<p>記得當洋丘八，還沒有離開上海的時候，有一天，他在酒後，把一個洋丘八錯認了，當作是知己，而去向他說了許多的酒話，結果，給那一個「洋丘八」賞賜了幾腳「外國火腿」，但老張倒也「不甘示弱，照樣把它那酒缽也似的拳頭，還敬過去，於是就同那一個「洋丘八」狠狠的打了一大架，混亂的結局，「洋丘八」給打破了高鼻子，淌了一臉的血，而掛了彩，老張也着關在床上躺倒了幾天。</p>
<p>老張不發脾氣的時候，到是挺和氣的！笑眯眯地跟誰都客氣得很，他時常親嘴地跑到我的身旁，拍拍我的肩頭說：「小兄弟，唉！幾時請我吃喜酒哪？」總親得我飛紅了臉，他卻打着大聲的哈哈跑遠了！</p>
<p>老張的年紀已近五十了，但精神倒是夠好的！去年還添了一個小子呢！記得我曾向他尋開心：</p>
<p>「嗨！老張！人老心淡老哇！您到還養老來予呢！」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭說：「呣：嘸不辦法麽！」六只小猢猻，真把我的老骨頭都要啃光了。</p>
<p>確實，老張一家的「生活擔子」的重量，是着實不輕哪！因此；生活就把他的手和足，都給支配得一息也不停，廠裏有工作的時候，就到廠裏來工作，沒有工作的時候，就偷着空跑到上海四郊的河浜裏去綱魚，弄一些錢湊湊家用，不然就去替人家鋸柴片，弄一斗米錢……總之，什麽事情都幹，祇要是有錢賺！</p>
<p>手，足，力氣－－是他求生的「三大法寶」，但是此外，一只「老酒瓶」，也是他形影不離的隨身法寶，老張假使少去了它，那末：就決沒有力氣去換飯吃，所以，老張把它看作是「吃飯傢生」。</p>
<p>真所謂的「袖裏乾坤大，壺中日月長」。於是我們大家都喊他「老酒鬼」，他也笑眯眯地承受不辭！</p>
<p>「犯關，……犯關，……話真犯也關，族爲……上台……嘔犯關，待聽我……白舌連根……話一　……」</p>
<p>「老酒鬼」的寗波人番橄欖的小調，又在無處響起來了，那麽今天他的老酒又灌暢了：我們又得留神些了呢！</p>
<p>不要惹動他！</p>

<p>— 胡生權</p>
<p>也許是日子過得太無聊了，前幾天我和金約定，想去看看牢監，隔絕在另一個世界裏的人們，究竟是怎樣打發日子的。第二天，他便打電話通知我，約我禮拜六一起去。忽然，我想起了一個起充實生活而感到生活空虛的詩人，便寫了一封信給他，問他要不要去「視察」一下牢監？信送出沒有多少時候，他氣咻咻跑到我的家裏來了。</p>
<p>「移到祖籍日去參觀，不是很好麽？」</p>
<p>我沒法給他一個確定的回答。我在嘴角裏掛了一個笑容：好朋友呵，你知道我是多麽渺小，什麽事可以給我自己決定？</p>
<p>詩人是敏感的，他歎氣了。他說，他新近進了家出版社，不好意思頭二天便告假。心裏雖然想去，但是……。他在我的朋友中，是比較「安份」的一個，安份人也有安份的苦楚！</p>
<p>但是不安份呢，那是更糟糕了。我有一對朋友，一個是吃了生意飯，想做清高的「文化人」；一個吃了教科書飯，想做長袖善舞的商人，理想總是美麗的，於是無論精神上物質上都感到很痛苦。這是何苦呢？生在這個世界上萬事都只能求其媽媽虎虎，如果在失眠的夜裏，偶然認真一下，真是令人懷疑：這樣生活着，我們還是一個「人」？</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>下午二時，金來了，他穿着一套畢挺的西裝。他告誡着我：一，不許跟囚犯說話；二穿得體面些。第一點，可難倒我了，我本來只想在短褲背心上，套上一件香港衫，奈不體面何？於是臨時尋出一套西裝來，金看着我流着汗上背帶打領結，擺出老哥哥的樣子，有些愛惜我了：</p>
<p>「你不是在穿衣服，是在受罪！」</p>
<p>我看着他，用手帕拭着汗，拿着一把蒲扇拆侖　着，將一條領帶吹得東西飛動。請問：我是受罪，你是－－什麽？</p>
<p>走進二重鐵門，站在門邊的警察都向我們立正，這使我很得意，那一個警察把我們小百姓瞧在眼裏，獨有他們向我們行禮。後來想想也恍然了：我怕不是叨了人家的光，如果不是做了典獄長的「貴客」，門警們的皮鞋恐怕早已賞光到我的身上來了。不要說別的，幾家報館的門警，不也是常常用白眼落到我的身上麽？</p>
<p>隨着一位「頭腦」，我們看過了工　，病院和男牢。在歸途上，碰到了一位婦牢的「先生」。他很熱心地說：</p>
<p>「諸位阿要去看看婦牢監？」</p>
<p>於是我們就又重新　進去了</p>
<p>典獄長夫人曾經對我說過：女牢裏的猶太人和羅宋人穿了中國人的囚衣，是「別有風味」的。我並沒有心思欣賞什麽「別有風味」，但是既然進來了，便順便參觀一下。牢監總是陰　的，當我從男牢裏出來並不懷着頂好的心情。</p>
<p>在走廊裏，有一大羣囚犯聚集着，一位年老的太太漲紅着臉指手劃腳地對他們着學說。我起初還當是什麽精神講話之類，後來據「先生」告訴我們，是在講「耶穌道理」。</p>
<p>我們走到二樓囚房，「頭腦」對我們說：</p>
<p>「女犯是比較優待的，兩個人聞一聞，並且有得床睏。」</p>
<p>這句話是真的。但是有幾間囚房都把床靠着牆壁擱起來，我用着疑問的眼光看著「先生」們，其中有一位向我解釋了：</p>
<p>「現在天氣熱，有臭蟲，還是睏睏水門汀……」</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>爲了「節約」的緣故，我們在電車站上又被太陽烤出了一身汗。坐上電車，金問我：有什麽感想沒有？我搖搖頭。我記得有一位學法律的同學向我這樣說過：法律是美麗的。我懷疑着這「美麗」二字是怎樣解釋的呢？罌栗花是美麗的，變練蛇是美麗的，法律和它們同樣的「美麗」麽？我歎着氣。</p>
<p>我跟金說着「再會」，擠着許多人跳下電車，一個不小心，白皮鞋被人重踏上了一腳。這是吃了體面的虧，我痛惜著四十元錢，明天又該擦上一擦了。陡然，我在街上立定了，用眼瞧着掠過我的頭　：</p>
<p>－－爲什麽要學着忙人的樣子呢，慢慢走不是很好麽，今天總算乘了幾次車，明天不是又　在家裏沒事了麽？何苦忽忽忙忙，讓白鞋子給人踏上一腳！</p>
<p>我捲起了嘴角，向自己戚戚地笑着。</p>

<h3 id="c44">排球聯賽　女子組成績優異　男子技術應求進步 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>本屆排球聯賽，甲女組已於本週內全部結束，宣吿功德圓滿矣。觀本屆演出，男組方面，絕小進步。而女組方面，確有極顯著之優異成績，故先談粵華，並樂爲介紹綠隊。蓋　女子之水準之能提高，亦所以提起女子運動之興趣也。</p>
<p>男冠軍粵華</p>
<p>粵華隊員盡爲粵產健兒，由蕭錫庚領導。此番異常突起，三戰三勝，榮　冠軍。論其演出，實未達最高峯。頭排鎖網二排救球，似均有漏洞。然隊員作戰精神，極見興奮，於是衆志成城，屢挫强敵。其戰績如下：</p>
<p>勝華影　三—一</p>
<p>勝俄乙　三—〇</p>
<p>勝白隊　三—一</p>
<p>又該隊第二戰勝俄甲一役，最爲得意。唯以俄甲以後連棄權兩次，故不列矣。</p>
<p>女冠軍綠隊</p>
<p>綠隊繼獲籃球·圓門一球兩項錦標後，在排球聯賽於本週內又連克三之省華嚴兩隊，稱霸排壇，造成變括本年份女子球類錦標，誠值得我人佩服也。觀本屆綠隊演出，在永準方面，確屬提高不少·緣戰後滬上女子排球，水準每况愈下，輙見每賽僅有過網之能力，殺球扣球吊球，跌　救球，攔網等等，絕少注意，而綠隊在此各方面，均有成就，獲得冠軍，決非偶然。茲錄該隊戰績及評述該隊之各方面於下：</p>
<p>勝志騫　二—一</p>
<p>勝三省　二—一</p>
<p>勝華嚴　二—〇</p>
<p>又該隊首戰以二到〇勝西靑紅，現以西靑已棄權兩次，照童取消，故不列入。</p>
<p>加速訓練精勝人</p>
<p>按綠隊對於排球本無組織。此次動機，純為愛好運動，乃倉卒成軍計迄今不到三月。然成軍以後，當即規定每逢二四六，在靑年聯誼社練習，每次全隊隊員，俱能不　路遙，胃暑而往，益以敎練錢旭滄之多才多藝，用智訓練。管理謝益欽之熱心，從中策劃，且有白隊諸隊員相與切磋。於是綠隊巾幗之排球球藝，一日千里，有此優越之戰績也。</p>
<p>人材平均攻守有路</p>
<p>該隊人材可稱絕擊平均，不論頭排二排三排，均無一特出之材，而均能就其位置應有之發揮而儘　發揮。其特點主腦為汪印　黃杳芬黃明媛。救球方面，以王維珍項毓琳爲最得路。其戰術方面，攻守均能變幻出奇，實制勝之關鍵</p>
<p>强敵當前沉着作戰</p>
<p>此次加入之數隊，均有歷史。如三省華嚴，組織已久，訓練亦多。志騫則集新進名將及拉攏老將陣容盛茂。綠隊以一新興隊伍，與之周旋。在與志騫三省二隊作戰時，均先失一局。但綠隊隊員俱鎭靜異常，沉着作戰，其所以能挽回敗局而終得吿旋，此種耐能，允爲其他球隊隊員所可效法。</p>
<p>繼續努力前程無限</p>
<p>綠隊排球旣獲得錦標，以其目下之成績而論，再加努力，則在女子排球之地位，未可限量。其須改善注意者，鄙意守時尙有空隙，地位未臻最理想，及發球尙未能登堂入室，與頭排鎖綱功夫，似欠純熟耳。如能此三點有改進，則綠隊之排球，豈僅稱霸滬上而已。</p>
<p>最後介紹綠隊最成功之各女英雄之個人拔術：</p>
<p>項毓琳——項居三排之中，無獲分之機地，故不為人所注意。實則項站立地位之佳，能救出　險之球，且其救出之球，　送至最相當之地位，決非其他人選可比擬。故我以爲項應居首功臣，亦太季最成功之一員。</p>
<p>黃杏芬——以老半風度，施其經騐豐富之演出，或作擊殺，或用吊角，盡如人意。當者有球未來已心怯之現象，誠名不虛傳。</p>
<p>王維珍——王為滬上女排球隊中最理想二排中之將士。蓋其不避跌　，身體玲瓏。救球方面，非此不足以成功也。</p>
<p>汪印蘭——出生頭排中央，利用其跳起之高，扣殺方面運用甚便。其更可取者，汪極肯用腦筋。其殺敵之道，時有變　，對方捉摸不定，祗能望球興嘆。</p>
<p>黃明媛——黃本屆初試敲擊，竟然一舉成功，加以其本來救球之能力，于是稱得上一能攻能守之全材。</p>
<p>餘如新進　承然劉珍　嚴　芝等，亦有意想不到之成績，假以時日，必可造器。</p>

<p>全滬公開壘球聯賽，自我華隊熊貓加入以來，連戰皆捷。中外一致咸認該隊封冠軍已有染指之希望。今日（十三日）上午十時三刻，熊猫將與一大敵週旋於膠州公園，該隊乃上屆冠軍「路斯坦奴」紅隊（Lusitans）。熊猫若能擊敗之，則此西人獨霸之錦標，將爲我華人奪得矣。今於賽前，記者檢討該二隊陣容及實力，略抒管見如下：</p>
<p>葡隊實力</p>
<p>先談葡隊。該隊投手湯拔拉（Tombutter）乃X·M·H·A·電台廣播員，其人極胖。但所投之球，全滬無出其右。其急快，實使擊球者難揮其棒。全隊隊員，球迷知者甚多，均爲葡聯足球隊員。如一壘手蓋恩，三壘手G蘇若，游擊奧立佛，右外翼V蘇若，捕手彼得生等。無論接擲，均快而敏捷。使人最可怕者，乃熊猫將逃不過三壘手及游擊之閃電接擲。故華隊攻時能擊至一二壘間則佳，因二壘手不甚高妙。若能擊低而急之球，保證能上壘。同時能擊至投手之中綫問亦甚適宜，因投手乃胖子，恐其週轉不靈，容易上壘。但言來容易，投手之球，余未敢信華隊能擊之如意也。同時華隊切忌輕易偷壘，因捕手彼得生接之妙，及峻急擲球，每使走壘者因之被殺，豈非可惜。華隊應把握上　機會，因能上壘已非易事也。若能謹愼走壘，能多得一分即多得一獲勝希望·此外切忌擊高球，因敵隊外翼均③接之。故華隊若所投之球不易舉出，則應多利用短擊（Shortbump）最好能「踫一球至一投手之左手近旁或沿綫，即有希望上壘矣。還有一點，華隊宜謹愼排定擊球次序（Batting　orcer）。熊猫之弱點乃擊球稍差，全隊能擊球佳者只四五人。故應於前五人及後五人中，逢單數者應排善擊之球員，使優劣平均也。</p>
<p>熊貓陣容</p>
<p>至於華隊熊貓之陣容，其內圍綫（Infield）各守壘者均爲留日名手，緊密異常。尤以游擊梁友聲，三壘手溫瑞雄，二壘手溫天華，均出手如矢。至於捕手有二人，一爲黃應瑞，一爲王秀山，二者均接球如膠手。前者資格老練，但最近手傷，恐表演不能如意。後」者王君，年少果敢，除接鄭神出鬼沒外，爲擊球中之二者名之重擊手（Heaby　batter）。除以爲若黃君爲捕手時，不妨調王君爲外翼，使華隊多一擊十球員及上壘獲分之機會。且王君能爲捕手，則任外翼必能勝任之。此外華隊守時最應注意者，乃各壘手接球後，若有雙殺機會，應急速擲出，切忌猶疑不決。因壘球賽之獲勝，貴在迅速也。且敵隊均　攻者，偷壘每不顧命，而擊球又佳，各外翼應時刻留意，稍一鬆懈，必將失一分累累矣。</p>
<p>末了，請讀者注意。本報前刋之熊猫戰程，已爲主辦當局全部改期。一俟排定，當即披露。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Only Swear to Kill the Enemy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>Our sincerest hope and prayer for the new coalition cabinet of Koiso and Yonai is that it will truly embody the principle of "change brings progress." If the cabinet, after so much effort and upheaval, remains the same as its predecessor, exhibiting no real change, it would not only negate the purpose of its formation but also render the entire process superfluous. I believe that a cabinet change should bring about a renewal of spirit, a clearing away of the stagnant and impure, like guiding stagnant water into a bottomless abyss. It should harness all new vigor and energy to prepare for victory against the enemy. Only with such resolve and conviction can it fulfill the initial mandate given to Generals Koiso and Yonai. We, the one hundred million people of Japan, deeply believe this and eagerly await the results.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that anyone who heard the news of Army General Koiso and Navy Admiral Yonai being appointed to form a cabinet did not feel a surge of unusual excitement. Since the first Itō cabinet in 1885 until today, there have been forty-one cabinet changes. Among them, only the Ōkuma-Itagaki cabinet of 1898 and this one have been formed by two individuals. In other words, only twice in forty-one cabinet changes. However, the reason Ōkuma and Itagaki were jointly appointed was that the opposition parties led by Ōkuma and Itagaki merged and jointly criticized the Itō cabinet. As a result, Itō proposed that the two form a joint cabinet. Unfortunately, that cabinet was short-lived, lasting only four months. The reason was that Ōkuma and Itagaki each pursued their own agenda from beginning to end, appearing united but being estranged, and engaging in mutual suspicion and infighting, which ultimately led to its downfall. While the average tenure of previous cabinets was one and a half years, the Ōkuma-Itagaki cabinet lasted only one-quarter of that average. This time, Koiso and Yonai must not only carefully consider the positions of the Army and Navy but also deeply recognize that the Army and Navy are the true Japanese Imperial Army under the command of His Majesty the Emperor. Therefore, they must be united and act in concert, like the snake of Changshan, with head and tail corresponding, swift support in times of urgency, with one heart and one mind, from beginning to end. This is our earnest hope.</p>
<p>What we expect from the new cabinet is that everything be dedicated to the war effort. If someone asks, "What is this cabinet for?" the answer should be, "It is a cabinet for war." If asked, "Why are we fighting?" the answer should be, "We are fighting for victory." A war that cannot be won is a useless war. Once a war has begun, it must be carried through to the end. In other words, this cabinet must be one that absolutely completes the Greater East Asia War. Regarding this point, our one hundred million people must wholeheartedly support the policies of this cabinet and must assist the cabinet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must reflect on one thing. Saigō Nanshū once said, "Give credit to others, take the blame yourself," but unfortunately, today's world and human nature are the opposite. People even snatch others' merits for themselves, and they are skilled at shifting blame to others. This is the style of the general public today. If this is the case, it will be extremely difficult to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, all citizens, including military officers and civilians, must take this opportunity to emphasize the necessity of self-reflection. Today, there are captains who commit suicide because they damaged a ship, and technicians who take their own lives because they failed to complete an invention on time. When it comes to the soldiers of the Imperial nation, there are countless officers and men who value their responsibilities. This truly makes us bow in deep respect and gratitude. However, while there are such noble and self-disciplined Japanese men, there are also those who disgrace the Japanese name. Therefore, those in positions of authority must lead by example and constantly examine themselves.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, what is most needed today is harmony among people. Mencius also said, "Heaven's timing is not as good as earth's advantages, and earth's advantages are not as good as harmony among people." In extreme terms, what is needed today is not so much increased production of weapons or food, but rather increased harmony among people. If harmony fills the entire nation, then weapons will naturally increase in production, and food will naturally increase as well. But if harmony is lacking, then no amount of supervision or encouragement will be effective. To make people work, one needs power and wealth. But if one cannot make people willingly and sincerely submit, then no matter how much money is given or how strict the laws are, it will not be effectively implemented. The most important thing is to make people willingly and sincerely submit. In other words, to gain harmony among people. To achieve this goal, the first thing for those in power is to trust the people, the second is to respect the people, the third is to listen to the voices of the people, and the fourth is to stop bureaucratic politics and implement people-oriented politics. These four points are by no means newly invented fabrications, but rather the traditional political essence of the Japanese Imperial nation. Even Hōjō Yasutoki, a traitor who was criticized by the world, still regarded gaining harmony among people as an urgent task. Kitabatake Chikafusa in his "Jinnō Shōtōki" (A Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns) praised it extensively. To give a current example, if munitions factories, etc., were to work more diligently, there would definitely be room for increased production. I believe that the new Minister of Munitions, Fujiwara Ginjirō, knows this better than anyone else. However, there are often many people who ignore that this is a business that is closely related to the survival of the nation, and only pursue profit as their motto. If this is not corrected, no matter how much the industrial warriors are encouraged, no matter how many young men and workers are mobilized, the desired goal will not be achieved. To achieve this goal, empty talk is useless, and those in power must lead by example.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that the new cabinet must strive and persevere to the end. Victory depends on time. Regardless of victory or defeat, it is important to stubbornly persist. Just as Marshal Foch said, "My left wing is retreating, my right wing is collapsing, and all we can do is attack." Regardless of the circumstances, they must show the nation a strong determination that only an attack can bring victory. If those in power show weakness, the impact on the nation and its allies will be immeasurable. Therefore, we hope that those in authority will show the people of our country a strong determination. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tōjō has navigated through two years and nine months of long-term turbulent waves, and this is something that no one can fail to admire and respect. As for his achievements, opinions vary, but his hard work is universally acknowledged. We will not talk about the Tōjō cabinet, but about Prime Minister Tōjō. He himself was always full of enthusiasm and had a spirit that demanded victory. I believe that the newly appointed Koiso-Yonai cabinet will definitely inherit this.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Comprehensive War Results of Japanese Army and Navy Units in July: A Total of 1,030 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Imperial General Headquarters of Japan announced at 3:30 PM on the 12th that the comprehensive war results of Japanese Army and Navy units in attacking enemy air forces and engaging in interception operations in July were as follows: Enemy losses: 81 shot down and 60 destroyed in the South Pacific; 154 shot down and 112 destroyed in the Central Pacific; 3 shot down and 2 destroyed in the North Pacific; 80 shot down in China (17 unconfirmed), 475 burned and destroyed; 19 shot down and 44 destroyed in Burma and the Indian Ocean, totaling 1,030 aircraft. Japanese losses: 34 aircraft not returning from self-explosion missions, 105 aircraft damaged on the ground, totaling 139 aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - Since the enemy attempted to launch invasion operations, the air battles in various regions of Greater East Asia have also intensified, and the forces mobilized by the enemy air force in various theaters have also increased sharply. According to reports, the enemy mobilized approximately 72,000 aircraft in mid-June and 36,500 aircraft in July, which is clear evidence that the enemy, relying on British and American resources, is using air combat as a future operational strategy. Conversely, the Japanese army, with its isolated forces, either attacked or defended, bravely fought back, and destroyed enemy aircraft, achieving significant results. In mid-June, 1,460 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and in July, 1,030 aircraft were shot down or destroyed. Although the results in July decreased by 430 aircraft compared to June, they were still 120 aircraft more than in May. The Japanese army lost 369 aircraft in June and 139 aircraft in July, a decrease of as many as 230 aircraft. This is the result of the arduous struggle of the Japanese air force units. In addition, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking various theaters increased to approximately 15,000 in July due to the increased offensive in the Central Pacific at Nimitiz, which is 700 more than in June. From this, we can see the intensity of the enemy's attack on the Mariana Islands. In China, there were 3,600 aircraft, and in Burma, there were 5,500 aircraft. The size of their air force is evident from this. In particular, the Japanese air force in China repeatedly bombed the forward bases of the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing, such as Guilin and Liuzhou, destroying 555 enemy aircraft in July and inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy air force. However, the supply of the enemy's air routes in China and India seems to be greater than we expected and should not be underestimated. Looking at the trends of the Chinese war and the tension in the Pacific war, we can see the great significance of future operations in China.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Announcement by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters: Recent War Situation in Burma, Linking Lines to Prepare for the Next Operation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced on the 12th regarding the recent war situation in Burma, stating: Since the rainy season began in Burma, according to ordinary military common sense, the actions of both sides should be hindered by the weather. However, in reality, the Japanese army has been able to overcome natural conditions. The British and American allied forces attempted to open the Ledo Road to enhance their ability to fight against the Japanese army. The Japanese army has consistently fought bravely against them with outnumbered forces, enduring all unfavorable conditions. The war situation in various locations is described as follows: Southern Indo-Burmese Front: The Japanese army has linked strategic strongholds in the Buthidaung and Maungdaw areas, maintaining an iron-bow formation. There have been no major changes in the war situation. Central Indo-Burmese Border: The Imphal operation, which began in mid-March, has seen only advances and retreats since May, with no major progress. The Japanese army's active offensive has crushed the enemy's attempt to retake Burma, achieving the main objective of the operation. In August, the Japanese army voluntarily withdrew from the Kohima and Imphal areas to important defensive lines on the Indo-Burmese border to prepare for the next operation. Northern Burmese Front: Since the Yu-American Allied Forces attacked the northern Burmese border, the Japanese army has engaged in fierce battles in the Hukawng Valley area. Because the enemy relied on their supply lines, they had crossed the mountains on both sides of the Japanese army's position and advanced south. The Japanese army, in addition to inflicting heavy blows on them, gradually retreated to a new position on the north side of the Burmese railway west of Mogaung, confronting the enemy. The enemy forces in that area consisted of two divisions of the Yu army, one brigade of airborne troops, and two brigades of the West Indian army. The Yu army has suffered heavy losses due to the heavy blows from the Japanese army. In the Myitkyina area, the Japanese army fought bravely in isolation under the encirclement of superior enemy forces for as long as two months, and finally broke through the heavy enemy encirclement on the night of August 2nd and 3rd and retreated to the rear. At that time, the commander of the Japanese garrison ordered a junior officer to command the withdrawal operation, while he himself led a small number of subordinates in a final battle with the enemy, finally dying a heroic death. The fighting spirit of the Japanese Myitkyina garrison deeply moved the enemy camp, and Chiang Kai-shek used this to encourage his subordinates. The Japanese army on the Nujiang River front continues to secure key points on the west bank of the Nujiang River, thwarting enemy attacks, and continues to crush the enemy's attempt to open the Yunnan-Burma Highway.</p>

<p>A Certain Chinese War Plane Base, 13th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Japanese air force raided the US Air Force forward base in Ankang Airfield, Shaanxi Province, in northwestern China, on the morning of the 11th. A total of 13 small fighter planes caught fire and 5 were destroyed. In this operation, a total of 18 Yu-American planes were destroyed, and all Japanese planes returned safely.</p>
<p>Chinese Base, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - Around 9:30 PM on the 10th, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided the Guangzhou area. However, due to the Japanese army's strict air defense system, they were unable to penetrate the area and its vicinity and immediately withdrew. It seems that the Yu-American planes' move was a containment tactic to attack the Japanese mainland by air.</p>

<p>A certain base on the Hunan front, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Yu-American forces in the Guilin area, using mechanized units transported by the Yu-Indian air route, began to gather and encircle the vicinity of Hengyang on the morning of the 9th near Yingpo on the Baoqing-Hengyang road in order to retake Hengyang. The mechanized units were based on 4 tanks and had a force of more than 7,000 men. In order to crush the Yu-American forces' stubborn counterattack, the elite of the Japanese army began operations from noon on the 9th and are now fiercely attacking the mechanized units of the Lu-American forces in the western area of Hengyang, pressing to Shiqing, 90 kilometers west of Hengyang.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities recently announced that on the eve of the fall of Hengyang, Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to say goodbye. The Yu army authorities released his text as follows: Chiang Kai-shek received a report from Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army defending Hengyang, on the morning of the 8th. The report was sent at 7:00 PM on the 7th and was jointly signed by the army commander Fang Xianjue and three division commanders. The content was as follows: "The Japanese army broke into the center of the city today and is now engaged in street fighting. We are determined to fight to the last soldier and coexist with the city of Hengyang, fulfilling our duty as soldiers. This report may be the last report."</p>

<p>A Certain Base of the Japanese Army in Southern China, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - After defeating the 55th Division of the Yu Army, the 463rd, 464th and 465th Regiments on the 4th of this month, the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force on the 9th strongly attacked the bases of the Yu Army Southern Route Commando Unit and the 455th National Security Regiment (about 800 men) which continued to operate on the Leizhou Peninsula - Anpu and Hengshanxu, defeating the above-mentioned Yu troops. The Japanese army took Anpu and Hengshanxu at 9:30 in the morning. The significance of this operation is great because the Yu army had used Anpu and Hengshanxu as bases to gather military supplies using civilian ships and continuously engage in improper activities. The crushing of these Yu army units has enabled the residents of the Leizhou Peninsula to live in peace and engage in their livelihoods. In addition, more than 20 members of the Guangdong Provincial Government Propaganda Team were dispatched to the front line, which is a most noteworthy fact. As for the results of this battle, 70 Yu army soldiers were captured, 108 Yu army bodies were left behind, and the Japanese army seized a large number of heavy and light machine guns, rifles, and ammunition from the Yu army.</p>

However, the most urgent issue at this time is that the government, in accordance with the will of His Majesty the Emperor, reflect on where the people's hearts lie, and then grasp the people's hearts, so that they will willingly and sincerely cooperate with the government. The prerequisite for this is to gather the political forces of all circles and all aspects.

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction of the National Government, citing the heavy losses in postal economics in recent years, submitted a request to the authorities on May 11th of this year for permission to increase postage rates by 20%. This was implemented on May 16th and has been in effect for just over two months. The Postal Administration has again requested the Ministry of Construction to approve an increase in postage rates to 200 times pre-war levels, citing the need to increase employee salaries. This would mean an increase to ten yuan per letter for regular out-of-town mail. The Ministry of Construction believes that other state-owned enterprises, such as water and electricity, have only increased prices by 30 to 50 times pre-war levels, and that current postal rates are already high compared to the price increases of other utilities. Therefore, the authorities plan to disapprove the Postal Administration's proposed new rates, as they would not only increase the burden on the people but also stimulate other commodity prices.</p>

<h3 id="e19">China Railway Implements New Measures to Prevent Black Market Train Tickets; Purchasers Must Show Residence Permit or Citizen Certificate <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Since China Railway stipulated passenger trains, the crowding in front of Shanghai Station has become even worse, and black market train tickets are even more rampant. The China Railway authorities have finalized measures to avoid overcrowding and prevent black market ticket sales. It has been decided that starting August 15th, residence permit numbers will be recorded on train tickets to prevent resale. At the same time, tickets will be sold every other day to reduce crowding and prevent black market sales. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Recording Citizen Certificate Numbers</p>
<p>Citizen certificate numbers will be recorded on train tickets. When purchasing tickets, Japanese nationals must show their consulate's residence certificate to the ticket seller, and Chinese nationals must show their residence permit or citizen certificate. The number will be recorded on the back of the ticket. When boarding, passengers must present both the ticket and the aforementioned certificate for inspection. If the certificate number does not match the number on the ticket, it will be considered a black market ticket and boarding will be refused. When military police purchase tickets, a "military ticket" stamp will be added. Unless in uniform, the ticket cannot be used. The same certificate number will also be recorded on tickets sold by the East Asia Transportation Corporation. According to the above measures, those who purchase tickets from others at a high price will not be allowed to board. Please take note. In addition, if the ticket number does not match the certificate number when checking tickets on the train or at the station, the ticket will be invalid. In addition to purchasing a new ticket, a fine will be imposed.</p>
<p>Military Tickets Sold One Day in Advance</p>
<p>Ticket sales at the station were previously limited to the same day. Now, tickets will be sold the day before, but only at Shanghai Station. The method is as follows: Sales begin at 10:00 AM on the day before departure, but sales will stop when the quota is full. The trains sold are: "Beijing-Shanghai Line" departing at 8:00 AM (third class to Wuxi), departing at 8:30 AM (first, second, and third class to Nanjing), departing at 9:50 AM (second and third class to Nanjing), "Shanghai-Hangzhou Line" departing at 7:30 AM (second and third class to Hangzhou).</p>
<p>To give preferential treatment to long-distance passengers other than military personnel, government officials, and public employees, those taking the 8:30 AM train from Shanghai are limited to stations above Wuxi, those taking the 9:50 AM train are limited to stations above Changzhou, and those taking the 7:30 AM train are limited to stations above Jiaxing. These passengers can purchase tickets the day before. However, short-distance passengers will still follow the original procedures. The East Asia Transportation Corporation will also sell tickets every other day from now on. Passengers must travel in the class specified on the ticket. Those who violate this rule must purchase a new ticket and pay a fine. In addition, tickets cannot be returned after the train has departed.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Household Flour Rationing to Be Doubled This Month; This Year's Wheat Purchase Results Are Excellent <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Household rice rationing in this city resumed on the 10th of this month. At the same time, the flour ration will be doubled starting in August. According to this year's wheat production in Central China, the yield is expected to increase by about 10% to 20% compared to previous years. Since the Flour and Wheat Control Committee actively promoted the purchase work, the results have been excellent. To date, it has reached 20% of the target, so this year's food prospects are very optimistic. The original flour ration for each person per month in this city was three catties. Due to the good wheat crop situation mentioned above, it has been decided to increase it to six catties starting in August. The price will still be 20 yuan per catty for first-class flour, 18 yuan for second-class flour, and 10 yuan for third-class flour. Since household rice rationing was suspended for the past two months, residents of this city have felt that there was insufficient food. Starting in August, not only will household rice be restored to six sheng per person per month, but the flour ration will also be doubled. In addition, employees in important industries and public employees will also have a special allocation of 4 to 15 kilograms of rice, so there will be enough daily food. The serious food problem in this city can also be solved as a result. It is believed that the general price level will gradually decline under this influence, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Business Control Committee Studies Control Plans <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>After its reorganization and establishment, the National General Business Control Association immediately began studying plans for the control of goods, especially rice, which is the most important commodity and is of concern to the general public. The entire society and people's livelihood depend on the supply and demand of rice and whether the control is good or not. Therefore, the first thing that the association focused on was the smooth determination of the rice control plan. In order to simplify the control work, the association has followed the instructions of the Executive Yuan and applied to transfer materials such as rice, flour, wheat, cotton, cotton textiles, and beans in the grain ration to the respective control committees for handling. Other matters related to the movement of controlled materials other than rice, cotton, cotton textiles, flour, wheat, and beans will still be handled by the association's Materials Movement Application and Permit Office.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Restriction on Electric Light Usage Time; Police Bureau Strictly Enforces; Orders All Branches to Conduct Thorough Investigations and Corrections <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government authorities, in order to conserve electricity, will restrict the usage time of electric lights and have established provisional measures. For household electric lights, whether indoor or outdoor, the use of electric lights is strictly prohibited from 12:00 midnight to 5:00 AM (except for those who need it for professional reasons or for the care of sick people, lying-in women, or infants). Regulations for the use of electric lights for business purposes have also been established and are detailed in yesterday's newspaper. As for hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and other hospitality and entertainment venues, their business hours are limited to 10:00 PM. All lights, whether indoor or outdoor, are strictly prohibited after 11:00 PM. The Administrative Division of the Police Bureau has already followed the order and instructed the administrative sections of each branch to strictly enforce the above measures, starting from yesterday (the 12th). Police officers will be dispatched to conduct strict investigations and corrections in their respective jurisdictions, especially paying attention to and monitoring the business hours of entertainment venues. If any violations are found, a warning will be given. If they dare to persist, the electricity supply will be cut off, so that citizens will be encouraged to lead a wartime life.</p>
<p>Start Inspecting Vehicle Equipment</p>
<p>In order to adapt to air defense light control and sound control, the Shanghai Police Headquarters has now started to inspect the light-shielding equipment of vehicle lights and the sound control of horns for vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorized bicycles at the Racecourse from the 7th to the 18th of this month. Announcement No. 26 was published in the newspaper on the 3rd of this month, stipulating the inspection date and the license plate numbers of vehicles to be inspected. It is reported that if these vehicles are not inspected after the deadline, or if the vehicle owner or driver deliberately modifies the vehicles after passing the inspection, exceeding the controlled range, once discovered, the vehicle and driver's license will be detained and punished. All kinds of motor vehicles with numbers above 30,000 in the newly merged areas will also have their inspection dates and locations announced before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Supervisors Completed Training Yesterday</p>
<p>The Supervisory Office of the Municipal Police Headquarters, in order to strengthen the city's supervisory work, convened all 80 of its supervisors for training. It has now been completed. The director of the Supervisory Office, Mr. Guo Shaoyi, summoned all the trained supervisors at 3:00 PM yesterday to give instructions, saying: The staff of the First and Second Police Bureaus should be united and cooperate with each other. The supervisory work should be unified. Strengthening the supervisory work is the premise for consolidating the city's police administration. After the completion of this training, we should set an example so that we can correct the discipline of the city's police officers. For investigating cases, we should use swift and agile means to obtain accurate results of the cases. I hope that you will work hard at all times and not neglect your duties.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Public Reply Regarding the Teachers' Subsistence Allowance Issue <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper recently received a letter from Xu Chengqing and other primary and secondary school teachers, asking how the subsistence allowance for primary and secondary school teachers collected on behalf of this newspaper would be distributed. The collection of the teachers' subsistence allowance on behalf of this newspaper was entrusted by the Municipal Government and the Social Welfare Bureau. It was originally planned to transfer all the funds after the end of the collection, but the intention of the authorities was to keep it in temporary custody, so the donations were deposited in the Tailai Money Exchange for easy withdrawal at any time. Later, the primary school principals' association sent representatives to inquire about the distribution issue, and preparations were made for the transfer. However, the authorities intended to discuss the entire distribution method, so they asked for temporary custody. At that time, the police consumer cooperative went to Wuhu to purchase rice, so they agreed with Deputy Director Su and Manager Ding of the cooperative, and agreed to purchase the rice on their behalf. As soon as the rice is delivered, it will be handed over to the primary school principals' association together with the authorities to clear the procedures. I hope this will be clear to the public.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Health Bureau Strictly Bans Unhygienic Food and Beverages <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau has found that small vendors along the streets are selling unhygienic food and beverages, and cut fruits, etc., which are easily prone to cause epidemics when citizens buy and eat them. These unhygienic foods are the source of epidemics. In order to protect the health of citizens, a ban has been issued. However, there are still some unscrupulous vendors who ignore the law and only seek private gain, and still appear on the streets and alleys after 5:00 PM, specializing in this unhygienic cold drinks and cut fruits. In order to thoroughly ban these things, the Health Bureau sent personnel to various places on the afternoon of the other day to strictly ban them. They seized more than 2,500 catties of cut and rotten fruits, sour plum soup, cool powder, and colorful water, as well as many unhygienic beverages and dirty utensils. The bureau sent these unhygienic beverages and rotten fruits to the rendering plant for destruction, and all the dirty utensils were confiscated as a warning to others.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Municipal Propaganda Office Rectifies the Content of Small Newspapers <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>In order to urge the small newspapers in the city to thoroughly improve their content, eliminate bad habits, and meet the needs of the times and conform to the wartime cultural propaganda policy, the Municipal Propaganda Office specially convened the persons in charge and editors of various small newspapers at 10:00 AM on the 10th at the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government for an open discussion. More than ten people attended, including Hai Bao Tang Tiaohe, Li Bao Hu Ligeng, Social Daily Chen Tingchao, Oriental Daily Deng Gaixian, Fanhua Bao Mei Shuangdai Wang Xuechen, Ji Bao Lang Shibing Yao Luding, Ningbo Public Report Zhou Xiaozai, Drama Daily Lin Yiyun, Drama World Liang Zihua, and Robin Hood Report Qiu. Director Tian Liang personally presided over the meeting, and Inspector Zhang Ting from the News Inspection Office also attended to assist in the guidance. First, Director Liang gave instructions, explaining the significance of convening the discussion and pointing out in detail the impropriety of various bad habits of the small newspapers, which should be improved as soon as possible. At the same time, he also elaborated on the points that the authorities expected. Subsequently, the persons in charge of the small newspapers gave detailed reports on the current situation and future plans of each newspaper, followed by research on the improvement plan. The Municipal Propaganda Office specially formulated the "Instructions for Improving the Content of Various Small Newspapers" and put forward specific instructions point by point, including: increasing the proportion of current affairs news, assisting in publicizing government policies, not adding opinions on civil and criminal cases that have not been judged, the writing of special interviews for social news should be serious, texts attacking private individuals and damaging their reputation should not be published, clearing up decadent and pornographic texts, eliminating the records of strange and absurd superstitions, avoiding the publication of texts promoting improper businesses and gambling-related entertainment, and being careful about publishing news about black market prices and industrial and commercial information. The persons in charge of the small newspapers all expressed that they would comply and decided to start preparing immediately, implementing it from September 1, and stipulating that the three months from September to November would be a strict assessment period. If the assessment results show that there is still no self-examination and no positive improvement performance, the Municipal Propaganda Office will consider stopping its publication.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Special Consumption Tax in This City Is Being Actively Reorganized; Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau Issues a Statement <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The special consumption tax was universally implemented by the government on January 16th of this year in order to meet the needs of the wartime economy. This income has a profound relationship with both the country and the locality. Even the former First District Office took this income as the main source of tax revenue. When I was ordered to concurrently serve as the Director of the Finance Department on February 1st of this year, because the Finance Bureau itself was also planning to improve various taxes, I had no time to fully reorganize this special consumption tax. Now that the municipal government agencies have been unified, they are being completely planned for reorganization. Recently, newspapers in Guansi published news of dissatisfaction with the personnel handling the special consumption tax. If the content is true, it is my lack of supervision, and there is no way to deny it, and I am extremely ashamed. However, I have always advocated openness in tax matters. I have now temporarily adjusted the internal personnel and am planning to establish the special consumption tax as an independent institution, and hire well-known social figures with tax experience to preside over it, so that they can carefully study and improve the methods and thoroughly reform them. As for the rumors of corruption recently published in newspapers, I have now been ordered by the superior authorities to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. What the facts are will soon come to light.</p>

<h3 id="e29">A Suggestion for Using Old Books to Lend Books <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Rongyuan</p>
<p>At a time when raw materials are scarce, general manufacturers are doing everything possible to turn useless things into useful things and make full use of them. General users also know that material resources are difficult and expensive to purchase, so they save as much as possible. In terms of culture, which is closely related to the future of the country, if we want to promote its prosperity and strengthen the country and its people, so that the people can read, know the country, know their families, and understand themselves, we must popularize education and develop culture. If we want to popularize and develop it, we must make it affordable. However, now a sheet of white paper costs as much as a piece of high-quality silk material before the war, so a thin book can cost tens of yuan. Please explain why:</p>
<p>The paper produced by various paper mills in Shanghai mainly uses waste paper, old books, rags, waste flowers, and rice stalks as raw materials. Wood pulp and other materials have long been expensive, so they are not used. The manufacturing process of rags is more complicated, and there are electricity restrictions, so fewer people use them. Generally, waste paper and old materials are used as raw materials. I have a slight relationship with the paper and waste paper industries. I often see that old books contain famous works that have been out of print for decades or are extremely difficult to buy in society, as well as textbooks from various bookstores (the most), either brand new and unused, or used with many annotations, or incomplete, accounting for 60% of the waste paper. Old paper shops earn this valuable book at the price of waste paper and sell it to paper mills. The paper mills use female workers to tear up this good book to facilitate pulping. In this way, although the papermaking industry transforms useless waste paper into various usable papers, it must add alkaline materials, bleaching powder, rosin and other raw materials to become the desired paper, and then sell it to the printing industry to print various books. However, the quality of old paper after being transformed into new paper is not as strong as the original, and with other secondary raw materials, material manpower, coal and electricity expenses, it can become new paper. The printing industry then adds printing costs and various expenses, so the cost is high. Recently, electricity restrictions have been added, and the paper and printing industries cannot manufacture and print as much as they want, so it is no wonder that paper is expensive and books are expensive.</p>
<p>At this time of difficult life, parents of general students want to cultivate their children into useful people with all their might, and serve the country and society in the future. Therefore, those with insufficient strength apply for student loans. According to reports and what I have seen, there are not a few general students who are eager to learn, who have obtained loans but still cannot buy books and continue their studies, because a thin book costs tens of yuan. If it is a book for a middle school or university, it is not surprising that a book costs hundreds or tens of yuan. However, the school stipulates a certain book (assuming that there is no such thing in the national book). Taking the last semester as an example, there are many cases where a class cannot buy all the books even after traveling all over Shanghai. Then, it is difficult for the teachers to teach, and the students have no clue. Therefore, I will describe the general situation above, and ask Shanghai paper mills and waste paper industries, who are originally cultural elites, to move this book to student loans, or sell it to loan students at the price of waste paper plus a reasonable profit. Philanthropists and people who are enthusiastic about rescuing out-of-school students can search for books from the two industries mentioned above, and then entrust Shen Xin Er Bao or directly lend them to poor children. In this way, we can avoid the complexity of cracking and printing, save electricity and materials, and benefit students, which is also a method of rescue.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Analyzing Three Types of Letters: SOS! Expose! Payment! Hope for Full Assistance from All Sectors of Society and School Authorities <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the past ten days, we have been continuously receiving letters from students applying for assistance, ranging from over a hundred to twenty or so per day. Of course, we cannot bear to discard these lovely missives and have organized them one by one. Roughly sixty to seventy percent are from those who failed the entrance exams and are pleading for special consideration; ten to twenty percent are exposing classmates or acquaintances who, despite having comfortable family circumstances, also seek assistance funds, some even after passing the exam; and another ten to twenty percent are requesting early disbursement of assistance funds, otherwise, the school will not allow them to enroll. Among them, the first type of letters is written with every word a tear, being the most earnest. Generally, those who study diligently tend to have better grades, so their letters are filled with genuine emotion and are deeply moving! As the ancients said, "Do not be arrogant in victory, nor disheartened in defeat." If you failed this time, you will surely succeed next time. Moreover, we have been appealing repeatedly, hoping that wealthy gentlemen will generously donate funds. If there is an unexpected gain within twenty days, you may also receive assistance funds. For now, please wait. The second type of letters exposes those who are not genuinely poor and try to pass themselves off as such, thereby encroaching upon the places of truly impoverished students. Ask yourselves, how can you be at peace? We are grateful for your good intentions in exposing them, and we will dispatch personnel to secretly investigate. If it is true, we will immediately cancel their assistance and publicly announce their names. Regarding the third type of letters, those who have been admitted but whose assistance funds are insufficient to cover their expenses may inform the school, stating that the assistance funds have not been received and request permission for deferred payment. We also request the school to understand the plight of poor students and allow them to postpone payment. In summary of the above three points, we sincerely hope that all sectors of society and school authorities will give us full assistance and sympathy, for which we are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Zhonghua Book Company's Frugal Assistance to Education</p>
<p>A letter from Zhonghua Book Company states: "On the 5th of this month, our publishing house resumed business at its original location. Initially, we dared not engage in any extravagant activities in the interest of frugality. However, we received generous kindness from various sectors and colleagues, offering significant gifts and suggesting that they be converted into cash to assist education. Unable to refuse this gesture of goodwill, we have combined the monetary gifts received on that day and the expenses saved from tea and refreshments by our company to form a substantial sum, which we are transferring for the purpose of aiding impoverished students. We are now contributing Central Reserve Certificates worth 20,000 yuan as your newspaper's educational assistance fund, which we kindly request you to publish."</p>
<p>Huaiwen Middle School Accepts Half-Fee Students</p>
<p>Huaiwen Middle School has established two programs, half-fee and full-fee exemption, to admit students who were not accepted in this year's entrance exams. Their sincerity is deeply appreciated. A letter states, "We are writing to inform you that our school is run by teachers from the Provincial Songjiang Senior High School. We have devoted ourselves to educating talents for many years. This year, ten of our senior students were admitted to Jiaotong University, which has drawn the university's attention to our school's history. We, the colleagues of our school, are pleased and eager to follow the spirit of your newspaper's educational assistance. We are willing to accept fifteen half-fee students each in the first year of junior high school and senior high school, and ten half-fee students each in the second and third years of junior high school and senior high school. For students with extremely impoverished family circumstances and excellent academic performance, full-fee exemption will be granted. We respectfully request you to solicit and select students from among those who applied for assistance funds but were not selected to assist them. We hope you will consider our humble request."</p>

<h3 id="e34">Record of the Aerial Battle over Omiya Island <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>On June 11th, after receiving reports of the enemy's mobile fleet approaching, our air force units on standby immediately took off and began aerial patrols. At 0:00 PM, dozens of enemy Grumman fighters appeared in the distant sky. Our patrolling fighters, upon seeing this, launched a simultaneous attack from the clouds. The enemy also dispersed their formation, and a chaotic aerial battle ensued. Ground artillery simultaneously opened fire on the enemy planes invading the airspace above 〇〇 Island. A pomegranate-like barrage shattered the deathly silence, surrounding the fleeing enemy aircraft. The attacking planes landed from time to time to replenish fuel and ammunition. Maintenance personnel worked tirelessly under enemy fire to resupply fuel and ammunition. By 0:00 PM, the enemy retreated, and calm returned.</p>
<p>In this aerial battle, Ensign H shot down as many as three enemy Grumman fighters. Unfortunately, he had to land due to a fuel fire, and at the same time, his aircraft burst into flames, turning into an inferno. According to his account:</p>
<p>Perfect Weather</p>
<p>Never had there been such perfect weather for an attack. It was a pity that the fuel caught fire. Just as I was thinking of bailing out mid-flight, the aircraft was already burning. Right there, I saw enemy planes in the sky, and I used a dive bomb to shoot them down from the clouds. Furthermore, I saw enemy planes escaping through the gaps in the clouds and shot down three of them, but it was a pity that the fuel tank caught fire.</p>
<p>Reporters on a high platform, watching the aerial battle, shouted "Ah! Smoke is coming out!" "Another one is going down!" whenever enemy planes spewing black smoke plunged into the distant water, shouting "Banzai!" On June 12th, at 0:00 AM, more than ten enemy Grumman fighters attacked again. Subsequently, fighter-bomber squadrons (carrier-based fighters) continuously bombed, and the airfield and positions were engulfed in ash and dust. Our anti-aircraft guns and machine gun positions fired on the enemy planes, shooting them down one after another. The enemy dropped mostly 30 kg and 60 kg bombs and incendiary bombs. Sometimes, 250 kg bombs were also dropped. More than half of these bombs were time bombs, mostly set to explode after two to six hours. The incendiary bombs weighed about 5 kg, and seven to eight were bundled together and dropped simultaneously, piercing roofs and floors and landing inside rooms. Soldiers waiting in the shelters near the dormitories immediately came out to cover them with wet mats and pour water on them to extinguish the fire, so the damage was always very minor. Some houses were only pierced through the roof, and a few houses were burned down due to delays, but it was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>A Sea of Fire</p>
<p>The most annoying thing was that incendiary bombs caused wildfires. Once the dry tropical grass was ignited, one side of the mountain would turn into a sea of fire, which could only be extinguished by the unique rain of the South Seas.</p>
<p>On the third day, from 0:00 AM to just past 6:00 AM, large formations of seventy to eighty planes attacked, using dive bombing at angles of forty to fifty degrees. However, the skill of the crew was mostly immature. According to the prisoners, among the fighter crew, some had only eighty hours of flight time. Almost none of the bombs hit the intended target. After the fighter-bombers had dropped their bombs, Grumman fighters followed up with machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>On June 〇, a telegram with the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet was written on the blackboard:</p>
<p>"Commander of the 〇 Unit, our air force has begun a general offensive."</p>
<p>Kill All Enemies</p>
<p>Upon seeing the telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the unit commanders clenched their fists even tighter and flushed with excitement: "Good! Let's do it! We must kill them all!" In the evening, the battle headquarters below the unit commanders received the good news that our fleet's attacking fighters had landed at the airfield in the evening. The guide lights for night landing were also fully on standby. At 0:00 PM, the waiting 〇〇 planes, one by one, leisurely flew into the runway and immediately reported the results to the unit commanders. The squad members next to the unit commanders were also boiling with enthusiasm, their faces flushed red as they reported the battle situation. The command post was filled with bloodthirst. The reports from the pilots returning one after another were even more exciting, and they shook hands with each other to celebrate. After a short nap, the heroes who had made meritorious contributions set out again for the dawn attack. Seeing this state of attack, the reporter silently wished for lasting military fortune. In this way, due to the continuous twilight and dawn attacks, the torpedoes that hit the mark, and the results achieved, as announced by the headquarters, behind them are always the precious blood and sweat and lives of the sailors.</p>
<p>Seeing the attack of this enemy mobile fleet, it seems that the enemy lacks quite excellent crew members. (Translated from the July 24th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Japanese Warriors' Fierce Attack</p>
<p>The battle on Omiya Island is still extremely fierce. The enemy forces landing at Akashi Bay in the central part of the island's west coast and at Showa Bay in the southwest are being significantly hampered by the Japanese army's brave counterattacks.</p>
<p>Fearing the Japanese army's fierce night attacks and dawn battles, the enemy forces often lead with several tanks, with infantry timidly following behind. At night, they immediately lay mines in preparation for Japanese night attacks. However, by the 23rd, they landed on the peninsula between the two places, and on the 24th, they began to land in Ainamicho on the opposite shore of the island, rapidly strengthening their forces. Moreover, there were often five or sixty planes flying in the sky above the battlefield, preventing the Japanese army's daytime attacks.</p>
<p>In response, the Japanese army has been continuously conducting night attacks and dawn battles since the 21st—disrupting the enemy's landing points and inflicting great damage. In particular, on the 23rd, they lured five enemy tanks from the Japanese army's right-wing positions in the Showa Bay area to very close range and launched a fierce counterattack, destroying three and disabling the others. On the 24th, the defending troops, in cooperation with infantry and artillery, resolutely intercepted the enemy who attempted to land twice on the Kurohama area on the south coast of the Omote Peninsula. In the first attempt, one landing craft and eleven amphibious tanks were sunk out of two landing craft and twenty amphibious tanks. The second time, their landing attempts were completely crushed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at 5:30 PM on the same day, a 10,000-ton-class transport ship anchored in Showa Bay was spotted, and artillery fire was directed at it, hitting it twenty-seven times. The ship was immediately surrounded by thick smoke, heavily listing, and fled far away from the harbor. Although its sinking could not be confirmed, the power of the artillery raid was unleashed without regret, and morale was boosted.</p>
<p>Responding to the enemy's invasion operations in the Central Pacific, they are also stirring in the Indian Ocean. On the 25th, the enemy's mobile fleet approached the waters off Sumatra. The enemy's attack on Sabang was the second since April 19th. Their forces were greatly strengthened compared to the previous time, and their invasion attempts in that area became even more intense. On the 25th, several cruisers, destroyers, and submarines approached the waters off Sabang Harbor, and twenty-nine carrier-based aircraft flew into the sky, carrying out bombing while the ships shelled. The local Japanese army bravely repelled the attack, sinking two destroyers and one submarine, destroying one destroyer, and shooting down most of the attacking enemy planes, thereby repelling the enemy forces.</p>
<p>The damage from this enemy attack was minimal due to the fierce attacks of the frontline warriors, but vigilance must be maintained regarding the situation in the Pacific and the enemy's invasion attempts in that area. (Translated from the July 27th Newspaper)</p>

<p>Mr. Huang Jiajiang, leaving Mr. Xiaoping, stayed on Omiya Island for about a month and a half in May and June of the year following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, personally experiencing the island's climate and customs shortly after its occupation. Upon hearing that the headquarters had announced that enemy troops had begun landing on the island in two divisions, he recalled his memories as follows:</p>
<p>"So the enemy has finally come? Not to mention our soldiers, I am sure that the resident expatriates are also fighting to the best of their ability!"</p>
<p>Speaking of Akashi Bay, it was where the Japanese army morally landed on December 9th, the day after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. There stands a commemorative stone tablet written by a certain commander at that time, "The Land of the Imperial Army's Landing." There is also a "Battleground" stone tablet in front of the American government building. There were only about thirty expatriate men, all of whom had come to the island thirty years ago. Some had farms, and others ran businesses, achieving considerable success, which was passed on to their descendants. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they were all imprisoned in jail with resentment. Within a few days, they were liberated due to the Japanese army's arrival. Their joy could not be expressed in words. Having been suppressed for a long time, they now felt fortunate to be Japanese. They rose up and welcomed our soldiers with sincerity. Mr. Shimada was the chairman of the Japanese association, and Mr. Shimizu was also a prominent figure on the island. I once saw an old woman named Sawada, about fifty years old, who forgot sleep and food, rewarding the Japanese army, from serving tea to washing clothes, without being negligent. Now that enemy troops have forcibly landed, these people will surely be unwilling to give up their lives and property and will cooperate with the imperial army. Most of the islanders are of mixed Spanish and indigenous descent, speaking American English, but their temperament is very straightforward. After the imperial army occupied the island, they became very close to the Japanese soldiers, and the children often played in the guardhouse. They also memorized Japanese words and phrases, sincerely wanting to be friendly with the Japanese. These children, who had received American-style education for a long time, also bathed in the imperialization of Japan. When the enemy invades, they will share the same hatred and anger as the Japanese army! (Translated from the July 24th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Three-Dimensional Warfare on the Western European Front <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>German soldiers and war correspondents are returning to Paris from the Western European front in increasing numbers, quickly contacting their work. Reporters have sought to meet with these brave men each time to learn about the front lines. The following is a collection of firsthand reports.</p>
<p>Counterattack at Sea</p>
<p>The British and American navies are now using Portsmouth and Southampton as advance bases, controlling the sea within the quadrilateral area from Cherbourg in the west to Le Havre in the east. Their flank defenses consist of the British navy's "Warspite," "Ramillies," and "Nelson" battleships, each of the 30,000-ton class, as well as five or six cruisers such as "Glasgow" and "Orion," and fifteen destroyers, forming a defensive wall. The waters of the text, on the other hand, are occupied by the American fleet, which includes the battleships "Nevada," "Arkansas," and "Texas" of the 30,000-ton class, as well as cruisers and destroyers, with strength roughly equal to the British navy, forming an iron wall on the east and west sides. In the middle, from the British mainland to the currently invaded area's coast, the enemy brazenly floats buoys and builds twelve supply lines, freely transporting ships, which is now the lifeline of the enemy forces advancing in the invasion operation.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Wall is not intended to absolutely prevent enemy invasion, but rather to cover the concentration of friendly forces in the early stages of the operation after the invasion, so as to allow for the deployment of attacks. For this military purpose, the German navy has fulfilled its mission to the fullest extent. The counterattack of the land forces has now reached its tenth stage. The explosion of meteor bombs in the British mainland is the signal for the start of this battle. With the goal of destroying the enemy's supply, the coordinated offensive of the navy must unfold with a tactic that is reversed in time.</p>
<p>The enemy planned to annihilate the German navy, which had no battleships, in three days after the start of the war. To this, Germany responded with a surprise attack tactic of high-speed boats, establishing war results everywhere.</p>
<p>If viewed in terms of naval power, the disparity in strength between Britain and the United States and Germany is enormous, no different from a battle of 30,000 tons against 1,000 tons, that is, a battle of 35-inch guns against 4-inch guns. But the German army fights fiercely, and under these conditions of great disparity, they engage in mutual fire. The German coastal batteries of the Atlantic fortress often engage ten British cruisers in one fortress.</p>
<p>Land Counterattack</p>
<p>The land counterattack has been in a rather difficult situation for the past two weeks because the power of the enemy fleet often dominates the land. The enemy gained experience in the landing operation in Italy, that is, in establishing a bridgehead successfully within the range of naval guns. In the Le Havre area, German tanks were threatened by the enemy when they were two kilometers from the coast and had no choice but to engage in artillery battles with the enemy cruisers, thus falling into a difficult situation. The land forces in northern France responsible for defending the Atlantic fortress have 30-inch shells from warships flying south of Caen and Bayeux, and in fact, large artillery battles cannot be conducted.</p>
<p>But now Germany has invented meteor bombs that fly across the English Channel and strike at the heart of the British mainland. This news has shaken the world. Germany may conduct surprise attacks simultaneously, which is quite noteworthy. According to well-informed sources, in the future, the enemy's new offensive may tend towards the area between the Seine River and the mouth of the Somme River.</p>
<p>Aerial Counterattack</p>
<p>In terms of the air force, German units have launched bombing raids on London again, and good news is frequently reported. The camp of intercepting enemy aircraft and achieving victory is becoming stronger. The reporter often visits the train anti-aircraft gun positions in a certain suburb of Paris. These positions are composed of mobile trains. What is interesting is that they were transformed from a German-owned place in France during the First World War.</p>
<p>Moreover, the speed of anti-aircraft shells has increased by 20% from the start of this war to today. The current speed is said to be three times 300 meters per second, that is, 900 meters per second, while the speed of a fighter is only 600 kilometers per hour, or 160 meters per second. Therefore, German anti-aircraft gun positions have produced a theory of hitting the target every time. (Translated from the June 27th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Past and Present of Normandy <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The coast of England is a cliff, and northern France also has many cliffs, making it difficult to navigate. Choosing to land on the sandy coast of the Seine Bay may be common sense for strategists, but the side that is targeted will certainly be fully prepared in the sandy area. Therefore, the two sides have launched an unprecedented battle, and its future is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Normandy on the 6th is picturesque, with apple blossoms in full bloom. Especially after the gloomy winter has passed, for half a year, the blue sky is clear, and the tender green is clearly reflected in the sunlight, making people drowsy. This beautiful Normandy is now reduced to a battlefield of life and death. The swallows returning from the south, longing for Normandy, do not know where they will rest and nest.</p>
<p>Longing for Normandy,</p>
<p>My birthplace…</p>
<p>This is a world-famous folk song.</p>
<p>The so-called "Normandy" is named after the Normans (Northern Danes) who lived there. Around the tenth century AD, the Normans, along with the Nordic Vikings, went south, launching crazy riots. They then settled down, practiced intermarriage, and Britain and other countries elected the Danish crown prince Knut (chief of the pirates) to the throne, implementing good policies, which was quite famous in history.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century, the Hundred Years' War began. The King of England, Edward III, in order to conquer France, sent 10,000 archers and 1,000 boats to bravely carry out a landing battle, in 1346. The landing point was in La Hogue (near the present city of Caen). At that time, there was internal strife and turmoil, and the residents of Normandy did not know how to defend themselves, allowing the English army to ravage them. As a result, the English army occupied the Port of Calais. For the next two hundred years, England controlled the two ends of the shortest distance between England and France, securing control of the sea over the Strait of Dover. The tragedy "The Burghers of Calais" originated from this. Rodin's masterpiece "The Burghers of Calais" is located in the present city of Calais, and the feeling of increased hatred has a long history.</p>
<p>After the end of the Hundred Years' War, King Henry V of England followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, attacking with a large army of 30,000 at Harfleur, west of the present Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine River. The location is the same as this landing battle.</p>
<p>The residents of Normandy have not yet renewed the brave legacy of the Nordic peoples endowed by their ancestors. Most of the residents are engaged in multiple occupations. The people crossing the stormy waves of the North Sea to fish in the deep sea are all Normans. Naval personnel and sailors are also mostly Normans.</p>
<p>The central city of Normandy is Caen. The great playwright Corneille of the 17th century was born here, and the literary giant Flaubert of the 19th century was also born here. It is truly a city that commands the present. Flaubert's masterpiece "Madame Bovary" uses the city as its subject.</p>
<p>Maupassant, who was born in Normandy, loved Normandy, and whose novel subjects were mostly Normandy, is also unforgettable. Born in the Caux region, he chased after the children of peasants and fishermen in the fields as a child, or went boating at sea, happily forgetting to return. When he grew up, he lived in Paris, practiced writing on a floating boat on the Seine River, and became famous by learning from his teacher Flaubert.

<h3 id="e38">The Third Child <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lin</p>
<p>With great difficulty, Ah Jin endured until quitting time. Covered in fluff, she lumbered out of the factory gate with her large belly, mixed in with the large group of female workers.</p>
<p>Fatigue mixed with dizziness and back pain caused her to fall behind her companions, and she happened to bump into Ah Zhao from the coarse yarn section who was vying to get ahead.</p>
<p>"Zhao Di! It's not going to work!" Ah Jin raised her weak hand for help towards Zhao Di.</p>
<p>Ah Zhao supported Ah Jin's hand and slowed her pace.</p>
<p>"Ah Jin, elder sister, I think your time is near. You should rest for a couple of days until the baby is born!"</p>
<p>"I eat for the day I work. What will I eat if I stop?"</p>
<p>"Who told you to be so intimate with Cai Fu?" Zhao Di made a face and pinched Ah Jin's arm.</p>
<p>"You little rascal!" Ah Jin couldn't help but force a smile and scold her lightly.</p>
<p>Ah Jin dragged her heavy belly into the house and slumped onto the three-legged chair that leaned against the wall. She began to feel a sour ache in her waist that shot straight to her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>She tried hard to straighten her back, which seemed to make her feel a little better, but after a while, an even more intense pain came, like waves in the ocean, one wave surging after another.</p>
<p>The pain of childbirth had been tormenting Ah Jin for the third time since she married Cai Fu. Ah Jin could endure suffering a bit for childbirth, but she hated her husband's heartlessness. Cai Fu had never agreed to let her keep the little child she carried in her womb. Cai Fu always said, "I can't even take care of myself. Don't let another little wretch live to suffer too!" So the first two were thrown away in a piece of tattered cloth next to some trash can as soon as they were born, before Ah Jin could even tell if they were boys or girls. Thinking of this, Ah Jin felt that she was enduring this pain in vain.</p>
<p>She clenched her teeth and said voicelessly, "This time, I must keep it."</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, Cai Fu also returned from the machine factory carrying a lunch box. He understood what was happening when he saw his wife lying on the bed.</p>
<p>"Is it soon?"</p>
<p>"Does it hurt badly?" It was such a trembling low voice.</p>
<p>"Let me go get the old woman!" (The old woman was a traditional midwife)</p>
<p>"No, wait a bit."</p>
<p>Ah Jin opened her eyes and looked at her husband's face, which had long lost its smile. She really couldn't bring herself to say that she wanted to keep the child. An even more intense, gut-wrenching pain struck again.</p>
<p>"Aiyo!" Ah Jin screamed miserably and straightened her back with effort.</p>
<p>Cai Fu looked at his wife, who was suffering in agony, and couldn't help but feel pity. He sat down next to her on the hard wooden bed and stroked Ah Jin's disheveled hair.</p>
<p>"Jin Di, let me go get the old woman?"</p>
<p>"No, Cai Fu! Are you willing?"</p>
<p>"Don't dream!" Cai Fu remained silent for a long while before saying coldly, "Just blame them for being born into the wrong family. Poor people can't afford to raise children."</p>
<p>"Do a good deed! Just let me keep this one. I won't have any more children next time."</p>
<p>"What will we feed him? I haven't become rich. I'm a copper worker (i.e., a machine worker). Be clear about that."</p>
<p>These heartless words sounded extremely cruel to Ah Jin. As for Cai Fu himself? He also felt that it was too unfair to Ah Jin to throw away her child for the third time. The first time was a baby girl, and he casually threw her away. The second time was a baby boy, fair and plump, and even he felt a bit reluctant when he threw him at the alley entrance. Perhaps it was because Cai Fu was already thirty years old this year. Shouldn't a thirty-year-old have a little toy to keep him company? And so, the small face of a child appeared before him, a pair of small, black, round eyes, red and wide cheeks...</p>
<p>A faint sense of emptiness swept across his heart.</p>
<p>But his wife's cries reminded him. Cai Fu raised his hands to support his head and caught sight of the pale thigh exposed through the hole in Ah Jin's torn pants. This made him think that life was like enduring the tight sting of a whip. The two of them had to work more than twelve hours a day just to barely fill their stomachs. How could they possibly afford to keep a child? Moreover, if they kept the child, could Ah Jin still go to the yarn factory to work? Even if someone said that they could sneak the child in for a bit of money, an extra mouth meant extra expenses. Besides, they couldn't raise the child naked.</p>
<p>"Oh dear!" Ah Jin was struggling again, straightening her back. Cai Fu looked at his wife, who was writhing in a heap, sighed, and went out.</p>
<p>While Ah Jin's stomach pain turned from shouting to moaning, and from moaning to shouting, only able to use all her life's strength to twist the tattered cotton quilt, Cai Fu finally brought back Mother Zhou.</p>
<p>Mother Zhou placed a bundle of bitter herbs on the table and reached out to feel Ah Jin's belly, only muttering, "It's coming soon."</p>
<p>"Hasn't the water been heated yet? Hurry!" Mother Zhou ordered.</p>
<p>Cai Fu blankly lit the fire in the mud stove.</p>
<p>After three hours, the child was born. Ah Jin finally saw a blood-red, plump baby boy, but she was too tired and could only half-open her eyes to watch Mother Zhou clean up the baby.</p>
<p>"Quick, boil bitter herb water for her to drink," Mother Zhou said to Cai Fu with a nod.</p>
<p>But Cai Fu ignored her at first and pulled out a pair of tattered pants from under the bed.</p>
<p>"Cai Fu!" Ah Jin struggled to call out to her husband, but it seemed she didn't even have the strength to speak. Helpless, she turned her head away, her face half-pale and weary, her chest rising and falling rapidly, replacing her protest.</p>
<p>"Have pity on me!" Like a faint thread of a voice, "I've already lost two. Can you bear to lose a third? It's a boy!"</p>
<p>Cai Fu was stirred by this soft murmur, as if he was moved. But when he caught sight of Mother Zhou's face, waiting for the delivery fee, he quickly squatted down to move the little life as if making a huge decision. Originally, he hadn't even thought about where he should get the delivery fee for Mother Zhou.</p>
<p>"You..." Ah Jin barely managed to lift herself up to stop him, but she didn't even have the strength to move.</p>
<p>"You... so... cruel..." She collapsed wearily, only slightly raising her head.</p>
<p>Cai Fu ignored her. He hurriedly wrapped the bloody flesh and went out.</p>
<p>Ah Jin wanted to cry, but she felt that she couldn't shed tears. It was as if thousands of needles were piercing her chest, tightening her heart.</p>
<p>"Living is just suffering."</p>
<p>She deeply tasted this.</p>

<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>"A universe in his sleeve, sun and moon in his bottle!"</p>
<p>"Fan guan,... Fan guan,... words really violate guan, clan becomes... ascends the stage... vomits violating guan, wait to hear me... white tongue connects root... speaks a..."</p>
<p>When Old Zhang approached us humming that little tune of the Ningbo olive seller that we were already tired of hearing, we knew that he had filled up on old wine again today!</p>
<p>If, on any day, that little tune didn't come out of his mouth, then we all had to be careful, because at this time Old Zhang was often very likely to find something to vent his anger on!</p>
<p>But: he didn't necessarily lose his temper when he hadn't had enough old wine, but even when he had filled up on old wine and the little tune of the Ningbo olive seller was getting old, he could still lose his temper!</p>
<p>Because: we couldn't predict when he would lose his temper, so we all had to be careful - not to provoke him and get a punch.</p>
<p>Old Zhang, filled with yellow soup, was very brave! He feared neither heaven nor earth. If he had a knife, he would definitely kill someone. Therefore, whatever engineers or staff in the factory... had to stay away from him.</p>
<p>I remember when the foreign soldiers hadn't left Shanghai yet, one day he mistook a foreign soldier for an acquaintance after drinking, and went to tell him a lot of drunken words. As a result, that "foreign soldier" rewarded him with a few kicks of "foreign ham," but Old Zhang also "refused to show weakness" and respectfully returned his fist that was like a wine bowl. And so he had a big fight with that "foreign soldier." In the chaotic ending, the "foreign soldier" broke his high nose, bleeding all over his face, and was injured. Old Zhang was also confined to bed for a few days.</p>
<p>When Old Zhang didn't lose his temper, he was quite amiable! He smiled and was very polite to everyone. He often affectionately ran to my side, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Young brother, sigh! When are you going to invite me to your wedding banquet?" He always made me blush, and then he ran away with a loud laugh!</p>
<p>Old Zhang was almost fifty years old, but he was in good spirits! He even added a little boy last year! I remember I once teased him:</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Zhang! People get old and lose interest! You're still raising children in your old age!"</p>
<p>He shook his head and said, "Mmm: there's no way to avoid it!" Six little monkeys are really going to gnaw my old bones clean."</p>
<p>Indeed, the weight of Old Zhang's family's "life burden" was really not light! Therefore, life controlled his hands and feet, keeping them going non-stop. When there was work in the factory, he would go to the factory to work. When there was no work, he would secretly run to the rivers around Shanghai to cast nets and fish, earning some money to make ends meet. Otherwise, he would go to saw firewood for people, earning a dou of rice money... In short, he would do anything as long as he could earn money!</p>
<p>His hands, feet, and strength were his "three great treasures" for survival, but in addition, an "old wine bottle" was also his inseparable treasure. If Old Zhang lacked it, then he would definitely not have the strength to earn a living. Therefore, Old Zhang regarded it as his "tool for eating."</p>
<p>Truly, "a universe in his sleeve, sun and moon in his bottle." So we all called him "Old Drunkard," and he accepted it with a smile and without complaint!</p>
<p>"Fan guan,... Fan guan,... words really violate guan, clan becomes... ascends the stage... vomits violating guan, wait to hear me... white tongue connects root... speaks a..."</p>
<p>The "Old Drunkard"'s little tune of the Ningbo olive seller is ringing out again, so he has filled up on old wine again today: we have to be careful again!</p>
<p>Don't provoke him!</p>
<h3 id="e40">A Chapter of Floating Life <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shengquan</p>
<p>Perhaps life was too boring, so a few days ago Jin and I agreed to go see the prison, to see how people isolated in another world were spending their days. The next day, he called to inform me, asking me to go with him on Saturday. Suddenly, I thought of a poet who felt empty despite having a full life, and wrote him a letter, asking him if he wanted to "inspect" the prison? Not long after the letter was sent, he ran to my house breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better to visit on our ancestral home day?"</p>
<p>I couldn't give him a definite answer. I wore a smile on my lips: dear friend, do you know how insignificant I am, what can I decide for myself?</p>
<p>The poet was sensitive, and he sighed. He said that he had recently joined a publishing house and was embarrassed to ask for leave on his first few days. Although he wanted to go, but... He was one of the more "content" ones among my friends. Even content people have their own hardships!</p>
<p>But being discontented is even worse. I have a pair of friends, one who has made money in business and wants to be a noble "cultural person"; the other who has made money writing textbooks and wants to be a shrewd merchant. Ideals are always beautiful, so they feel very painful both spiritually and materially. Why bother? Living in this world, everything can only be so-so. If, in sleepless nights, one accidentally becomes serious, it is truly doubtful: living like this, are we still "people"?</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, Jin arrived, wearing a well-tailored suit. He warned me: one, don't talk to the prisoners; two, dress decently. The first point was difficult for me, as I originally only wanted to put on a Hong Kong shirt over my shorts and undershirt. But what to do about not being decent? So I temporarily found a suit. Jin looked at me sweating as I put on suspenders and tied a tie, acting like an older brother and feeling a little sorry for me:</p>
<p>"You're not getting dressed, you're suffering!"</p>
<p>I looked at him, wiping sweat with a handkerchief and waving a palm fan, blowing the tie back and forth. May I ask: am I suffering, what are you then --?</p>
<p>Walking through the double iron gates, the police standing by the door all stood at attention to us, which made me very proud. Which police officer would look at us ordinary people, only they saluted us. Later, I realized: I was probably taking advantage of someone else's influence. If we weren't "honored guests" of the warden, the police's leather shoes would probably have already honored my body. Not to mention anything else, don't the gatekeepers of several newspaper offices often roll their eyes at me?</p>
<p>Following a "head", we saw the workshops, the hospital, and the men's prison. On the way back, we encountered a "sir" from the women's prison. He said very enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"Are you all going to see the women's prison?"</p>
<p>So we re-entered again.</p>
<p>The warden's wife once told me: Jewish and Russian women in the women's prison wearing Chinese prisoners' clothes were "particularly charming." I had no intention of appreciating any "special charm," but since we were already here, we took a look. The prison was always gloomy, and I didn't come out of the men's prison in the best mood.</p>
<p>In the corridor, a large group of prisoners was gathered, and an old lady with a flushed face was gesticulating and lecturing them. At first, I thought it was some kind of spiritual speech, but according to the "sir," she was teaching "the teachings of Jesus."</p>
<p>We walked to the second-floor prison cells. The "head" told us:</p>
<p>"Female prisoners are treated better, two people to a cell, and they have beds to sleep on."</p>
<p>This was true. But in several cells, the beds were propped up against the wall. I looked at the "sirs" with questioning eyes. One of them explained to me:</p>
<p>"It's hot these days, there are bedbugs, so it's better to sleep on the cement floor..."</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○○○○○○</p>
<p>For the sake of "economy," we were roasted by the sun again at the tram station, sweating all over. On the tram, Jin asked me: do you have any thoughts? I shook my head. I remember a classmate who studied law once said to me: law is beautiful. I doubt how these "beautiful" two characters are explained? Opium poppies are beautiful, venomous snakes are beautiful, is the law the same "beautiful" as them? I sighed.</p>
<p>I said "goodbye" to Jin and jumped off the tram, squeezing through the crowd. Carelessly, someone stepped heavily on my white leather shoes. This was the loss of being decent, I lamented the forty dollars, and I had to wipe them again tomorrow. Suddenly, I stopped on the street, looking at the passersby hurrying past me:</p>
<p>-- Why learn from busy people, isn't it good to walk slowly, today I finally took a few rides, wouldn't I be bored at home again tomorrow? Why hurry, and let people step on my white shoes!</p>
<p>I curled up the corners of my mouth, smiling sadly to myself.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Volleyball League, Women's Group Achievements Outstanding, Men's Techniques Should Seek Improvement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>This year's volleyball league, the women's group A has completely ended this week, declaring the completion of meritorious deeds. Observing this year's performance, there is little progress on the men's group side. On the women's group side, there are indeed extremely significant outstanding achievements, so let's talk about Yuehua first, and also be happy to introduce the Green Team. It is precisely because the level of women's volleyball can be improved that the interest in women's sports is aroused.</p>
<p>Men's Champion Yuehua</p>
<p>The Yuehua team members are all Cantonese athletes, led by Xiao Xigeng. This time they rose exceptionally, winning three out of three games and winning the championship. Judging from their performance, it has not reached its peak. The front row locking net and the second row saving balls seem to have loopholes. However, the team members' fighting spirit is extremely exciting, so with the consensus of the people, they repeatedly defeated strong enemies. Their record is as follows:</p>
<p>Won Huaying Three—One</p>
<p>Won Russian B Three—〇</p>
<p>Won White Team Three—One</p>
<p>Also, the team's second win against Russian A was the most proud. However, Russian A has forfeited twice in a row since then, so it is not listed.</p>
<p>Women's Champion Green Team</p>
<p>After winning the basketball and one-goal championships, the Green Team, in the volleyball league, also defeated the three-province, Huayan teams this week, dominating the volleyball world, creating a championship in women's ball games this year. It is truly worthy of our admiration. Observing this year's Green Team performance, the level has indeed improved a lot. After the war, the level of Shanghai women's volleyball has been declining. Every game only has the ability to pass the net. Killing the ball, spiking, and hitting the hanging ball, falling to save the ball, blocking the net, etc., are rarely noticed, and the Green Team has achievements in all these aspects. Winning the championship is by no means accidental. The team's record and comments on the team's various aspects are recorded below:</p>
<p>Won Zhiqian Two—One</p>
<p>Won Three Provinces Two—One</p>
<p>Won Huayan Two—〇</p>
<p>Also, the team's first game was a two-to-zero victory over West Qinghong, now West Qing has forfeited twice, and the children are canceled, so it is not included.</p>
<p>Accelerate Training to Overcome People</p>
<p>According to the Green Team, there was no organization for volleyball. This time, the motive was purely to love sports, so a hasty army was formed, and it has been less than three months since the formation. However, after the formation of the army, it was immediately stipulated that every two, four, and six, practice at the Youth Friendship Association, and each time all team members are able to go regardless of the distance or stomach heat, and the coach Qian Xucang is talented and versatile, using wisdom to train. The management Xie Yiqin is enthusiastic and plans from it, and the White Team members also learn from each other. As a result, the Green Team's volleyball skills have improved by leaps and bounds, and they have achieved such excellent results.</p>
<p>Average Talent, Offensive and Defensive Routes</p>
<p>The team's talent can be said to be extremely average. Regardless of the front row, second row, or third row, there is no outstanding material, but they can all play their due role in their respective positions and exert their full potential. The main features are Wang Yin Huang Yaofen Huang Mingyuan. In terms of saving the ball, Wang Weizhen and Xiang Yulin are the most successful. In terms of tactics, both offense and defense can be changed and surprising, which is the key to victory</p>
<p>Stay Calm in the Face of Strong Enemies</p>
<p>Several teams that joined this time all have history. Such as the Three Provinces Huayan, the organization has been around for a long time, and there has been a lot of training. Zhi Qian gathers new famous generals and pulls together veteran lineups, and the lineup is prosperous. The Green Team is an emerging team, dealing with it. In the battle with the Zhiqian Three Provinces Two Teams, they both lost a game first. However, the Green Team members are extremely calm and fight calmly. The ability to turn the tide and eventually win, this kind of patience should be imitated by other team members.</p>
<p>Continue to Work Hard, Unlimited Future</p>
<p>The Green Team volleyball has won the championship. Based on their current performance, if they work harder, their position in women's volleyball will be unlimited. What needs to be improved and paid attention to, I think there are still gaps in keeping time, the position is not the most ideal, and the serve has not yet reached the stage of entering the room, and the skill of the front row locking net seems to be immature. If these three points can be improved, then the Green Team's volleyball will not only dominate Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finally, introduce the personal skills of the Green Team's most successful female heroes:</p>
<p>Xiang Yulin - Xiang lives in the third row, without the opportunity to score points, so she is not noticed. In fact, Xiang's standing position is good, she can save dangerous balls, and the balls she saves are sent to the most appropriate position, which is definitely not comparable to other candidates. Therefore, I think Xiang should be the first hero, and also one of the most successful members of the Taiji.</p>
<p>Huang Xingfen - Using the old half style, she applied her rich performance, either as a kill, or with a hanging corner, as she pleased. The ball has not come, the phenomenon of the party has been afraid of the heart, it is indeed worthy of the name.</p>
<p>Wang Weizhen - Wang is the most ideal general in the second row of Shanghai women's volleyball team. She does not avoid falling, and her body is exquisite. In terms of saving the ball, this is not enough to succeed.</p>
<p>Wang Yinlan - Born in the central part of the front row, it is very convenient to use her jumping height in terms of spikes. What is more commendable is that Wang is extremely willing to use her brains. Her way of killing the enemy is always changing, and the other party is unpredictable, so she can only sigh at the ball.</p>
<p>Huang Mingyuan - Huang tried knocking in this session for the first time, and she succeeded in one fell swoop. In addition to her original ability to save the ball, she can be called a full talent who can attack and defend.</p>
<p>Other newcomers Cheng Ran Liu Zhen Yan Zhi, etc., also have unexpected results. Given time, they will definitely be able to create a device.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Panda Team Battles the Portuguese Merchants' Red Team: A Decisive Baseball Duel This Morning <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Since the Panda team of our Chinese compatriots joined the Shanghai Open Baseball League, they have won every battle. Chinese and foreigners alike generally believe that the team has a good chance of winning the championship. Today (the 13th) at 10:45 AM, the Pandas will be facing a major enemy at the Jiaozhou Park, the reigning champion "Lusitanos" Red team. If the Pandas can defeat them, then this championship, which has been dominated by Westerners, will be won by our Chinese. Before the game today, the reporter reviewed the rosters and strengths of the two teams, offering my humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>Strength of the Portuguese Team</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Portuguese team. Their pitcher, Tombutter, is an X·M·H·A· radio announcer, and he is extremely fat. However, the pitches he throws are unmatched in all of Shanghai. His speed makes it difficult for batters to swing. Many fans know the players on the team, and they are all members of the Portuguese League football team. Such as first baseman Gaines, third baseman G. Su Ruo, shortstop Oliver, right fielder V. Su Ruo, and catcher Peterson. Whether catching or throwing, they are fast and agile. What is most frightening is that the Pandas will not escape the lightning-fast catching and throwing of the third baseman and shortstop. Therefore, it is best for the Chinese team to hit the ball between first and second base when attacking, because the second baseman is not very skilled. If they can hit low and fast balls, they are guaranteed to get on base. At the same time, it is also very suitable to hit the ball along the pitcher's central line, because the pitcher is a fat man, and it is feared that he will not be agile enough and will be easily put on base. But it is easier said than done, I dare not believe that the Chinese team can hit the pitcher's ball as they wish. At the same time, the Chinese team must avoid stealing bases lightly, because catcher Peterson catches so well and throws so quickly that runners are often killed as a result, which would be a pity. The Chinese team should seize every opportunity, because it is not easy to get on base. If they can run bases carefully, they will have a greater chance of winning for every point they score. In addition, they must avoid hitting high balls, because the opposing team's outfielders are all good at catching them. Therefore, if the balls thrown by the Chinese team are not easy to lift, they should make more use of short bumps, preferably "bumping a ball to the left of the pitcher's hand or along the line," which will give them hope of getting on base. There is also one point: the Chinese team should carefully arrange the batting order. The weakness of the Pandas is that their hitting is slightly worse; only four or five players on the team are good hitters. Therefore, in the first five and last five players, those who are good hitters should be placed in odd-numbered positions to average out the strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Panda Team Lineup</p>
<p>As for the lineup of the Chinese Panda team, the infielders are all famous players who have studied in Japan, and they are unusually tight. Especially shortstop Liang Yousheng, third baseman Wen Ruixiong, and second baseman Wen Tianhua, all throw like arrows. As for the catchers, there are two: Huang Yingrui and Wang Xiushan, both of whom catch the ball like glue. The former is experienced, but his hand is recently injured, and he may not be able to perform as well as he wishes. The latter, Mr. Wang, is young and bold, and in addition to catching Zheng's unpredictable pitches, he is a heavy batter among the hitters. Therefore, if Mr. Huang is the catcher, it may be a good idea to move Mr. Wang to the outfield, so that the Chinese team has one more hitter and a better chance of getting on base and scoring points. Moreover, if Mr. Wang can be a catcher, he will definitely be able to handle the outfield. In addition, the most important thing for the Chinese team to pay attention to when defending is that if there is a double play opportunity after each baseman catches the ball, they should throw it out quickly, and avoid hesitating. Because winning a baseball game depends on speed. Moreover, the opposing team are all good at attacking, and they often steal bases recklessly and hit well, so each outfielder should pay attention at all times. The slightest slackness will inevitably lead to the loss of points.</p>
<p>Finally, please note: The Panda's game schedule previously published in this newspaper has been completely rescheduled by the organizers. As soon as it is arranged, it will be disclosed immediately.</p>

<p>The Fuhwa Cup Mini-League, sponsored by the Fuhwa Tobacco Company, invites both Chinese and Western teams, all of whom are first-class players. Therefore, it attracts the attention of fans, and there are no tickets sold, allowing people to visit freely. No wonder every game is crowded with people, and the Donghua Stadium suffers from overcrowding.</p>
<p>Han Hai has recently joined the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, working with Zhang Banglun as colleagues, sharing the same aspirations. In the future, the two gentlemen will surely make greater contributions in work and football.</p>
<p>After the Three Provinces women's volleyball team lost to the Yuan team, some people were in tears.</p>
<p>Di Xianzhang was honorably appointed as the coach of the Bank of Communications volleyball team. Mr. Di recently served as a referee in the league. He seeks to be unremarkable in his new role.</p>
