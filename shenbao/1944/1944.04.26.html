<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">讀小倉顧問談話後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，昨日在滬招待中國記者團，就中國經濟現狀及未來施策，闡述抱負，並解答記者詢問。</p>
<p>小倉顧問說：「上海經濟之復興，實爲今日中國經濟重要課題之一。」「中國經濟最重要問題，在於如何使人物資源成爲戰力化？如何使民生得以安定？」又說：「統制經濟之方法並非一成不變，須視環境而異。就中國而言，中國有其固有之民情習慣及傳統，故統制方法必須完全適之，再加以客觀之分析而後可。若非如是，統制愈嚴，物資愈告缺乏，反與統制本義相背。故今後將研究過去統制經濟失敗原因，並希望能糾正過去錯誤，以求改善」。凡此諸點，正與我們過去一貫主張，若合符節。</p>
<p>我們期待小倉顧問是醫治中國經濟病態的名醫，現在讀了他的談話，我們認爲是大東亞戰爭以後，盟邦人士斷判中國經濟問題中最準確的診斷書，不愧是一位名醫。</p>
<p>小倉顧問，雖然自謙說，非爲經濟政策之負責者，不過，中國經濟病態之革除，除由中國官民協力以外，老實說，非得盟邦日本的切實協力，還是費力多而成效鮮的。所以，我們竭誠期待小倉顧問不但診斷，更進而爲之施手術，注射用藥，作一切必要之措置，中國經濟前途之幸，亦即大東亞戰爭前途之幸。</p>
<p>最後，我們仍然主張，今日中國經濟問題之危機，決不是經濟措施單獨所可挽救，必須配合政治力量，因此，革新政治應同時並進。</p>
<h3 id="c2">小學校應廢除英文課程 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>近來我們時常接到小學生家長們來信，表示若干敎會辦理的小學校英文課程的繁重，小學生讀英文的不合理與不感興趣，希望當局加以糾正。我們對此，亦有同感。</p>
<p>根據敎育部規定的課程標準，小學原無英文一項，即在戰前亦然。過去，上海租界在英美統治勢力下，少數不明敎育原理的敎書匠，爲迎合一輩買辦階層家長的心理，強令小學生卽讀英文，而不問其是否能够領悟消納？更不問其足以減弱學習本國國文的精力。所以，在過去上海租界以內的小學，英文一項死爲必修課程，自從英美勢力驅逐以後，自從租界收回以後，而小學的英文課程還是依然存在與繁重，這在違背敎育部法令觀點上，實爲不可理解的一事。</p>
<p>其次，小學生的年齡，都在十歲至十四歲左右，尤其十歲以下的兒童，腦力未充，在本國文字以外，強欲使之學讀英文，旣然不感興趣，同時亦無法領悟。況且，除本國國文外，還有許多本國文字的附屬課程，以兒童發育未充的腦力，應付本國文字，已覺吃力，而強令兼讀英文，事實上囫圇吞棗，不能消化，自費時間。同時浪費讀英文的時間，就是浪費讀國文的時間，就是耽擱國文的進步。結果，延誤了學習國文應有的基礎。從近年學生對於本國國文程度的普遍代劣現象以觀，更是莫大的損失。</p>
<p>至於在此戰時，英美是敵性國家，敵性國家的文字不免傳播麻醉思想的題材，誘惑腦力未充的兒童，不知不覺間遭受影響。這是另一應加注意的問題。</p>
<p>所以，我們主張小學校中應卽取消英文課程，小學生不必學讀英文。希望敎育當局從速執行法令加以取締，小學校當局從速自動取消英文課程。節省小學生未充實的腦力，側重於本國文字的學習，培養國文基礎。</p>
<p>此外，附帶希望的，現在一般機關團體，以至商業組織中，對於公文文書上，依然採用英文者，究其內容，完全沿着習慣，並無實用，在目前時代環境中，應加根本改革。而中國人與中國人之間，不以國語交談，以英語爲動聽，在過去已屬不當，在目前更應切戒。</p>

<p>中央社京訊　東亞醫學會第三屆大會，二十五日上午十時，在首都香鋪營中日文化協會和平堂，隆重舉行揭幕典禮。上午八時，各國會員百餘人，在中日文化協會集合，由大會會長褚民誼，副會長陸潤之·鮑鑑淸·大平得三（植村秀一代），總幹事侯召棠·宮川米次，總會會長林春雄等率領，恭赴國父陵寢謁陵致敬，八時許抵達陵墓，各會員魚貫登階，是日春風駘盪，燦爛陽光，遍照紫金山嶺，充分表現東亞前途之光明。八時五十分抵達墓頂，稍事休息後，向中華民國國父孫先生遺像行最敬禮，三鞠躬，禮畢，由會長恭獻花圈，並領導全體會員入墓室繞靈襯一週，瞻仰國父遺容，以示崇敬，謁陵儀式遂畢，當由各國會員向我國父陵寢行最敬禮時，全體異常肅靜，誠敬，東亞各民族精誠團結之精神，亦於此充分表現。謂陵畢，仍由褚會長等率領，乘原車返至中日文化協會，稍事休息後，即於十時正，舉行隆重揭幕式。會塲大門外，溫懸中·日·滿·泰·越·緬·菲等七國國旗，迎風飄揚，至爲壯觀，會塲禮堂台上，亦分掛七國國旗，四面更遍挿各國國旗，佈置荘嚴堂皇。十時正大會典禮儀式開始，主席團大會會長褚民誼，總會會長林春雄，大會副會長陸潤之，鮑鑑淸，大平得三（植村秀一代），大會總幹事侯召棠，總會幹事長宮川米次，秘書長林鵬　等就位，各來賓會員亦相繼就位。大會揭幕後，全體肅立，向中·日·滿·泰·菲·緬甸國旗行最敬禮（在鞠躬）。嗣由會長褚民誼氏致開會詞，繼由梅內長代表主席致訓詞，來賓日谷大使（松村參事官代），滿呂大使（參事官張蔭棠代），日大東亞省靑木大臣（代表），李敎育部長（次長趙潤　代），陸衛生署長，滿民生部長于靜遠（厚生司長關德潤代），日醫師公會會長（代表）等相繼致祝詞畢，總會幹事長宮川米次報吿會務，報吿畢，復臨時動議，上電我國府汪主席致敬，至十一時半，此東亞十億人士極爲重視之東亞醫學會第三屆大會始圓滿閉幕，全體並合影誌念。</p>
<h3 id="c4">開會之詞 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>主席，諸位來賓，諸位會員，今天是東亞醫學會第三屆大會會期，得蒙國府主席以及諸位來賓的光臨，諸位會員的踴躍參加，本人代表大會敬致十二分的謝忱。東亞醫學會是東亞共榮圈內唯一國際學術團體，回憶在三年前，由盟邦日本國內醫界有志諸士爲謀東亞共榮圈內各國人民之福祉，特發起籌組本會，當時在日本東京召開成立大會時，柬邀中·日·滿·泰·越五個選派代表出席，共　盤舉。我國政府應邀，遴選醫界名流十三人代表出席參加斯會，議定每年開大會一次，以期各國學術有以溝通，增加研磋之興趣，會後各國代表返國，即着手組成東亞醫學會各國分會，以期推廣　會宗旨於各國國民，而擴充研究，基礎之實力。去歲第二屆大會仍在日本東京舉行，我國赴會代表即增加至四十二人，本人亦親自東渡參加盛會，因鑒於本會爲東亞各國之國際會議，應輸流在各國舉行，藉以鼓舞各國醫界有志之士，得期共同觀摩，共同携手推進學術之本旨，曾經本人提出第三屆大會在中國舉行之要求，當蒙全塲通過。本人返國後，立即組織第三屆大會籌備委員會，積極籌備，歷時一年，又蒙政府贊助許多，各方加以援助，乃得有今日盛集一堂，共同作醫學學術之研討，尤其本屆大會除有以往中·日·滿·泰·越五國代表出席參加外，又有新興國家緬甸及菲律賓參加，足證東亞各國齊心協力之偉大精神。鑒諸以往，卜之將來，本會前途之遠大，東亞共榮圈之光明，實可預祝。際此東亞各國爲正義而戰爭之時，醫學之研究發展，實爲不可缺少之一部門，非但爲應付目前之戰傷，疫疾，健民增產之急需，即於戰後之一切建設復興，亦端賴醫學之研究發展，始可期萬全之效果。盟邦日本之醫學水準，在戰前已瑧世界第一流之地位，交戰以來，由於事實之需求及國內有識之士羣起研究之結果，更有長足之進展。新興滿洲雖立國未久，但國內一切俱步武盟邦日本，舉國朝野同心合力，故亦有良好之成績。泰·越·緬·菲四國，因位於熱帶區域，以往關於熱帶疾患之研究，早有定評，我國自革命成功以來，民衆思想革新，對於新進科學之吸收，研討不遺餘力，對於醫學之研究，亦一掃以往之傳統思想，積極抱定純學術，純科學之眼光，雖於其間屢經波折，幸賴一般有識之士頻挽狂瀾，得仍呈進展狀態。尤自國府還都以來，政府當局深識醫學之重要，徹底實行衛生行政及學術研究之改革獎勵，三年以來頗着成效，加以盟邦各國精神方面之鼓勵援助，國內學者之通力合作，前途甚可期待。而然際此劃時代的變動時期，無論任何方面，決非一個國家之單獨行動，單獨力量所能永久支撑，所能推動，必須以集團國家的總力來互相研磋，相互砥礪，才能達到理想之目的。所以東亞醫學會的存在，正是適合現在的時代，謀一個利用集團總力來研究今後東亞共榮圈內諸民族之醫學發展的途徑，它的使命，因此也是很重大的。盟邦日本即爲東亞共榮圈內醫學先進國家，自應站在領導地位，提倡全東亞醫學者的合作，爲東亞全民族謀最大福祉，我們各人能參加這種偉大的工作，實應當互相勉勵，互相欣幸。</p>
<p>今天的大會，雖已是第三屆，但它的產生究只有短短的三年，還在在需要扶植與培養，希望在會各會員基於本會成立的宗旨，齊心努力提高東亞民族的學術水準，使我們共同組成的東亞醫學會的前途，愈加光明，愈益遠大。</p>

<p>南京二十五日中央社電　邇來滬市盛傳黃金自由買賣之消息，純爲無稽之謠諑。蓋黃金一項，在事變之前固已收歸國有，迨至事變以後，以未以黃金作爲貨幣之基礎，故未沿用前例，惟以其尙未完全離開通貨之本位，故當局對黃金之交易，始終取監督態度，以防投機者操縱，而致刺激物價，影響民生。是故，在本年二月初，曾有滬市大批黃金投機奸商被逮，且商統會關於此事曾於去年十月專案函請財政部解釋，當經復稱：今後黃金自可自由買賣，價格並無庸限制等語。中央社記者爲明瞭此種眞象，特專訪財政部錢幣司司長鍾家驤氏，據談：黃金在事變前，固曾收歸國有，惟自還都以後，因並未以黃金作爲貨幣之基礎，故未沿用前例，惟爲防止投機操縱等行爲，乃加以限制，關於今後交易情形，則仍斟酌情況，隨時監導糾正，俾免釀成意外之惡劣影響。</p>

<p>主席，各位代表先生，各位來賓，今天是東亞醫學會第三屆大會的第一天，汪主席閣下因病不克到會，派兄弟代表參加，藉此機會，得與各位先生共聚一堂，感覺異常快慰。想到第二屆大會，去年在東京舉行，正式參加的國家，僅中·日·滿·泰·越五國，這次的大會，除了中·日·滿·泰·越以外，菲律賓，緬甸都有正式的代表參加這一個盛會，無論在實質上，精神上，都充分表現大東亞共榮圈的範圍一天一天的擴大，勢力一天一天的膨脹，建設工作一天一天的進展，東亞民族的團結一天比一天堅固。一言蔽之，就是大東亞解放的前途，一天比一天光明，這種光明的前途，完全是神聖的大東亞戰爭賜給我們的，我們談到大東亞戰爭，就不能不對這一個神聖戰爭的先驅者盟邦日本表示無限的敬意。</p>
<p>兄弟對於這次東亞醫學大會的觀察，認爲這是超乎學術的一種集會，這一個集會，在性質上雖然是關於學術溝通，可是在意義上，實在是一個空前具有歷史意義的東亞民族精神的結合。不過兄弟對於這一次大會還抱着一種遺憾，也是在座的先生們所應當感覺到的，就是在座的先生當中，不見有印度的代表。去年在東京舉行的大東亞會議席上，緬甸的代表巴莫長官閣下曾當衆宣布說：「東亞尙欠完整……沒有人提到東方，而不想到印度，印度不自由，東亞的自由也談不到，」今天在這個盛會中間，兄弟要首先喚起大家的注意。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是我們全東亞民族的一個生死關頭，現在正是戰爭最緊張的時期，雖然前途是有無限的希望，雖然在東亞民族一致團結之下，我們確信最後的勝利必然是屬於我們，可是我們不能抱純粹的樂觀。單憑內在的力量，而忘記艱苦持久的奮鬥，在今日生爲競爭最激烈的時代，不往前進，便要後退，但是後退，就是死路一條。今日這個時代，絕沒有我們後退的餘地，我們要忍受萬般痛苦，來完遂大東亞戰爭。不過在痛苦中間我們還要分析一下，有許多是無法避免，而且應當忍受的，有許多是可以設法避免的。無法避免而且應當忍受的痛苦，我們要拿出勇氣來接受，可以避免的那就要盡量的避免。什麼是無可避免而應當忍受的呢?譬如在戰爭時期，各人的衣食住行，都要受到很大的限制，丈夫從軍，妻子流離失所等等，這種痛苦，從國家的立塲來說，實在是無法避免，而且是應當忍受的。什麼是可以避免的呢？拿各位先生們平時所研究的對象，就是一個很好的例子，換言之，就是疾病，疾病是人生痛苦中之最大的，在戰爭時期，疾病一定比平時要多，這種痛苦是可以設法避免的。近代醫學不但要注意治療，尤其要注意預防，所謂患於未然，一定可以得事半功倍的效果。我們預防疾病的工作，不僅是爲前方的將士，同時還要注意到一般民衆，尤其是鄉村偏僻，人所不注意的地方，這是戰時基礎的工作，沒有比它更重要的了。</p>
<p>兄平平時對於研究醫學的人，異常的重視，很喜歡和他們接觸，因爲他們是有科學的頭腦，對於常人和病人體內體外的一切，都能清楚的分析。對於各種疾病的治療及預防，都有深切的研究，這種分析研究，擴大來看，簡直可以作治理國家的參考資料。車家彷佛是一身體，有心臟，也有四肢五官，也有生命，疾病也有，有時避難所忍受外加的痛苦。一個治國的人，要果斷，精細，熱誠，彷彿也就是一個醫生，所以各位平時所用的方法，所研究的心得，是可以融合貫通，供給多方面的應用，不僅是單獨對醫界貢獻而已，中國古代所謂「良相比良醫」實在很有道理。</p>
<p>這個會是東亞醫學大會，提起「東亞」二字，我們立刻感覺到彼此都是一家，各位平時的苦心研究，是爲了東亞，這次不遠千里而來，謀學術的溝通，也是爲了東亞。經過苦心研究，互相溝通以後，進步一定是很快，這種進步，是整個東亞的進步。這一次會期雖然只有四天，可是彼此弟兄間的感情，可以更進一步，精神從此可以更團結。兄弟預料，下次的大會參加的國家一定更多，代表的人數一定也更多，這全靠我們的努力，我們多努力一分，多辛苦一分，東亞民族的痛苦，就可以減少一分，多努力一分鍾，多辛苦一分鍾，東亞民族的生命，就可以多延長一分鍾，大東亞的建設，東亞民族的解放，需要全東亞民族一致不斷的努力，向共同的目標邁進。</p>

<h3 id="c16">小倉最高經濟顧問　談經濟施策　昨在滬接見記者團闡述抱負 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>新任國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，昨（二十五日）由京來滬，擬與在滬各中日當局及滬上經濟界懇談，交換意見。小倉氏並於昨日下午五時半，在舉懋飯店九棋，接見中國新聞記者，到各報社記者二十餘人，席問就經濟現狀及未來經濟施策之抱負發表談話，闡述頗詳，擇要錄下：</p>
<p>發表談話</p>
<p>全於去年七月，會以日本民間經濟使節團團長資格來華，此次又國府最高經濟顧問資格來滬，實覺無限　幸。上海經濟之復與，實爲今日中國經濟重要課題之一，此後鑒於上海經濟之重要性，擬多來滬地，以與上海經濟界時作懇談。中國爲地大，物博，人衆之國家，故其經濟前途，實未可限量。惜過去之中國資源·多被英·美利用開發，今後將爲擊敗英·美建設大東亞而用。</p>
<p>余認爲中國經濟最重要問題，厥在如何使中國之人物資源成爲戰力化，如何使民生得以安定。此事雖有極大困難，但中日兩國之目標，爲建設來方道義精神之新秩序，故前途雖困難萬端，仍將努力使之實現。戰時經濟本須有機動性，且更須官民共同一致努力。但各國俱有不同國情，故施策上將愼重檢討，以求最有效果之方法。余身為顧間，但非爲經濟政策之負責者，故今後中國經濟之運營，須在國府當局與中國經濟界之創造力及責任上自行推進，故深　中國官民倍加努力，以期新中國之發展。</p>
<p>答記者問</p>
<p>名報社記者旋提出關於經濟與統制問題，小倉氏詳答如左：　物價問題，彼謂欲解決物價問題，須有二種施策，其一爲增加生產，其二爲　縮運貨。關於前者，彼認爲除增加食糧等必需品外，須同時解決各地間之運輸問題，如是生產量增加，各地物品互相流通，則物價自將低洛。關於後者，彼認爲流通市上之通貨，極有收縮餘地，嗣後將努力改善過去諸弊，使物價得以低落，民生得以安定。　統制經濟問題，目今爲戰爭時期，故統制經濟之目標，應置重點於增强戰力一點上，並須集中人的資源，物的資源，貢獻於戰爭。但統制經濟之方法並非一成不變，須視塲境而　。就中國而言，中國有其圖有之民情習慣及傳統，故統制方法必以完全適台之，再加以客觀之分析而後可。若非如是，統制愈嚴，物資愈告缺乏，反與統制本義相背。故今後將研究過去統制經濟失敗原因，並希望能糾止過去錯誤，以求改善。　上海股票問題，發行股票，原爲發展工商企業之動機，切不可利用爲投機對象，此影響金融事業甚亞，今後對於有投機行爲者應予糾正，務使趨入正常交易。　「渝方通貨膨脹頗多，有否影響華中金融，」此一問題，由全國經濟委員會經濟顧問主任新木（日本銀行經理）在接見記者席答稱：華中通貨當中央儲備銀行成立，本人曾頗爲關心其通貨之運營，後覺得中儲券發行極爲穩健與順利，由此可知華中人民對於中儲券之信用，己一致堅定，剛才聽說該慶通貨膨脹，倘中國政府與人民能緊密協力，必可不受影響，日本決以全力支援。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After Reading Advisor Ogura's Remarks <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, yesterday hosted a Chinese press delegation in Shanghai, elaborating on his aspirations and answering reporters' questions regarding the current state of the Chinese economy and future policies.</p>
<p>Advisor Ogura stated, "The revival of Shanghai's economy is indeed one of the most important tasks for the Chinese economy today." "The most important issue for the Chinese economy lies in how to transform human and material resources into combat power? How to ensure the stability of people's livelihood?" He also said, "The method of controlled economy is not immutable; it must vary according to the environment. As for China, it has its inherent folk customs, habits, and traditions; therefore, the control methods must be completely adapted to them and then subjected to objective analysis before they can be applied. If not, the stricter the control, the greater the shortage of materials, which would be contrary to the original meaning of control. Therefore, in the future, we will study the reasons for the failure of past controlled economies and hope to correct past mistakes to achieve improvement." All these points coincide with our consistent claims in the past.</p>
<p>We expect Advisor Ogura to be a renowned doctor who can cure the economic ills of China. After reading his remarks, we believe it is the most accurate diagnosis of China's economic problems made by Allied personnel since the Greater East Asia War, worthy of a renowned doctor.</p>
<p>Although Advisor Ogura modestly stated that he is not responsible for economic policies, honestly speaking, the eradication of China's economic ills, in addition to the cooperation of Chinese officials and civilians, requires the practical cooperation of the Allied nation Japan; otherwise, much effort will be spent with little effect. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Advisor Ogura will not only diagnose but also perform surgery, inject medicine, and take all necessary measures. The fortune of China's economic future is also the fortune of the Greater East Asia War's future.</p>
<p>Finally, we still maintain that the current crisis of China's economic problems cannot be salvaged by economic measures alone; it must be combined with political power. Therefore, political reform should proceed simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Primary Schools Should Abolish English Courses <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Recently, we have often received letters from parents of primary school students, expressing concerns about the heavy English curriculum in some church-run primary schools, the irrationality and lack of interest in English among primary school students, and hoping that the authorities would correct this. We also share these sentiments.</p>
<p>According to the curriculum standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education, primary schools originally did not have an English subject, even before the war. In the past, under the British and American ruling forces in the Shanghai concessions, a few teachers who did not understand educational principles, in order to cater to the mentality of a generation of comprador class parents, forced primary school students to study English immediately, without asking whether they could comprehend and assimilate it? Nor did they ask whether it would weaken their energy to learn the national language. Therefore, in the past, within the Shanghai concessions, English was stubbornly made a compulsory course in primary schools. Since the expulsion of British and American forces and the recovery of the concessions, the English curriculum in primary schools still exists and is heavy. This is truly an incomprehensible matter in terms of violating the viewpoints of the Ministry of Education's laws.</p>
<p>Secondly, primary school students are all around ten to fourteen years old. Especially for children under ten years old, their brainpower is not fully developed. In addition to the national language, forcing them to learn English, they are not interested, and at the same time, they cannot comprehend it. Moreover, in addition to the national language, there are many subordinate courses of the national language. Using children's underdeveloped brainpower to cope with the national language is already difficult, but forcing them to also study English is, in fact, swallowing dates whole, unable to digest them, and wasting time. At the same time, wasting time on reading English is wasting time on reading the national language, which is delaying the progress of the national language. As a result, it delays the necessary foundation for learning the national language. Judging from the generally inferior phenomenon of students' national language proficiency in recent years, it is an even greater loss.</p>
<p>As for during this wartime, Britain and the United States are enemy countries. The language of enemy countries inevitably spreads materials that anesthetize thought, tempting children whose brains are not fully developed, unknowingly suffering influence. This is another issue that should be noted.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that English courses should be immediately abolished in primary schools, and primary school students do not need to study English. We hope that the educational authorities will promptly enforce the law and ban it, and the primary school authorities will promptly and voluntarily abolish English courses. Saving the underdeveloped brainpower of primary school students, focusing on the study of the national language, and cultivating the foundation of the national language.</p>
<p>In addition, what we hope for incidentally is that currently, in general organizations, groups, and even commercial organizations, English is still used for official documents and documents. Upon closer examination, the content completely follows habits and has no practical use. In the current era and environment, it should be fundamentally reformed. And Chinese people not communicating with each other in the national language, but considering English to be pleasing to the ear, was inappropriate in the past, and should be strictly avoided even more so now.</p>

They arrived at the mausoleum at approximately 8:00 AM. The members ascended the stairs in an orderly fashion. That day, the spring breeze was gentle, and the brilliant sunshine illuminated the Zijin Mountain range, fully expressing the bright future of East Asia. They arrived at the top of the tomb at 8:50 AM. After a short rest, they paid their highest respects to the portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China, with three bows. After the ceremony, the President respectfully presented a wreath and led all members into the tomb chamber, circling the spirit coffin once, admiring the Founding Father's remains to show their respect. The ceremony of paying respects to the mausoleum was then completed. When the members from various countries paid their highest respects to the Mausoleum of the Founding Father of China, everyone was extremely quiet, sincere, and respectful. The spirit of the East Asian nations uniting sincerely was also fully expressed here. After paying respects to the mausoleum, they returned to the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in the original vehicles, led by President Chu and others. After a short rest, the solemn opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM sharp. Outside the gate of the venue, the national flags of China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines were hung, flying in the wind, which was very spectacular. The national flags of the seven countries were also hung on the stage of the venue's auditorium, and the national flags of various countries were inserted everywhere, creating a solemn and magnificent arrangement. At 10:00 AM sharp, the ceremony of the Congress began.

<h3 id="e4">Opening Remarks <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Fellow Members, today is the opening of the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association. I am honored to have the presence of the Chairman of the National Government and distinguished guests, as well as the enthusiastic participation of fellow members. On behalf of the Congress, I extend my deepest gratitude. The East Asia Medical Association is the only international academic organization in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Recalling three years ago, when enthusiastic individuals from the medical community in our Allied nation Japan initiated the organization of this association in order to promote the well-being of the people of various countries within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, when the inaugural congress was held in Tokyo, Japan, we invited representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, and Vietnam to attend and discuss plans. Our government accepted the invitation and selected thirteen prominent figures from the medical community to attend and participate in the congress, agreeing to hold a general congress once a year in order to facilitate communication and increase interest in research among the countries. After the congress, representatives from each country returned home and immediately began to establish branches of the East Asia Medical Association in their respective countries in order to promote the association's goals to the people of each country and to expand the strength of the research foundation. The second congress was also held in Tokyo, Japan last year, and the number of representatives from our country increased to forty-two. I also personally traveled to Japan to participate in the grand event. Recognizing that this association is an international conference of East Asian countries, it should be held in various countries in rotation in order to encourage enthusiastic individuals in the medical community in each country to have the opportunity to observe together and work together to promote the essence of scholarship. I once proposed that the Third Congress be held in China, which was approved by the entire assembly. After returning to China, I immediately organized the Preparatory Committee for the Third Congress and actively prepared for it. After a year of preparation, and with the support of the government and assistance from all parties, we were able to gather together today to conduct medical and academic research together. In particular, in addition to the participation of representatives from the five countries of China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, and Vietnam, there are also new countries such as Burma and the Philippines participating in this congress, which demonstrates the great spirit of East Asian countries working together with one heart and one mind. Considering the past and predicting the future, the bright future of this association and the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be anticipated. At this time when East Asian countries are waging war for justice, the research and development of medicine is an indispensable part. It is not only an urgent need to cope with current war injuries and epidemics, and to strengthen the health of the people and increase production, but also for all reconstruction and revival after the war, the success of which depends on the research and development of medicine. The medical standards of our Allied nation Japan had already reached the first-class level in the world before the war. Since the war, due to the needs of reality and the collective research of insightful individuals in the country, there has been considerable progress. Although the emerging Manchuria has not been established for long, everything in the country is following the footsteps of our Allied nation Japan. The entire country, from top to bottom, is working together with one heart and one mind, so there are also good results. The four countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines, because they are located in tropical regions, have long been recognized for their research on tropical diseases in the past. Since the success of our country's revolution, the people's thoughts have been revolutionized, and no effort has been spared in absorbing and researching new sciences. The research on medicine has also swept away the traditional thinking of the past, actively embracing the pure academic and pure scientific perspective. Although there have been many twists and turns in the process, fortunately, enlightened individuals have frequently turned the tide, and it is still progressing. Especially since the National Government returned to the capital, the government authorities have deeply recognized the importance of medicine and thoroughly implemented reforms and incentives for health administration and academic research. There has been considerable progress in the past three years. Coupled with the spiritual encouragement and assistance from Allied nations and the full cooperation of domestic scholars, the future is very promising. However, during this era of epoch-making changes, no matter what aspect, it is not possible for a single country's independent actions and independent strength to permanently support and promote it. It is necessary to mutually discuss and encourage each other with the total strength of a group of countries in order to achieve the ideal goal. Therefore, the existence of the East Asia Medical Association is precisely suited to the present era, seeking a way to use the total strength of the group to study the future medical development of the various nations in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its mission is therefore very important. Our Allied nation Japan is the advanced medical country in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and should stand in a leading position, promoting the cooperation of all East Asian medical personnel to seek the greatest well-being for all East Asian nations. We should all encourage and rejoice in being able to participate in this great work.</p>
<p>Although today's congress is already the third, its creation has only been a short three years, and it still needs support and cultivation. I hope that all members present will work together with one heart and mind, based on the purpose of the establishment of this association, to improve the academic standards of the East Asian nations, so that the future of the East Asia Medical Association that we have jointly formed will become brighter and more prosperous.</p>

<p>To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government: Chinese medicine sprouted earlier, and in ancient times it was a unique creation, but in modern times, there should be common knowledge and skills.

This year, in accordance with the resolution of last year, it is scheduled to be held continuously in Nanjing and Shanghai this month. Virtuous stars gather in China, surrounding the North Star, and purple energy rises from the East, adding to the spring scenery. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect and sincerely wish you health and strength.

<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: German Leader Hitler and Italian Commander Mussolini held a meeting on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. The two discussed political, military, and economic issues related to the two countries in the spirit of traditional friendship and reviewed common goals. Commander Mussolini immediately informed Leader Hitler that the Republican Fascist government, representing the entire Italian people, had resolved to intensify its efforts to fight alongside the Allied nations of the Tripartite Pact. This decision was greatly welcomed. The German government is currently providing effective support for the efforts of Commander Mussolini's government. The Tripartite Pact's determination to consolidate a new and just world order by defeating Bolshevism in the East and Jews and financiers in the West has been demonstrated in Leader Hitler's declaration. The declaration states that in the coming decisive battle and in the implementation of post-war goals, they will mobilize all mental willpower and use all worldly strength. When Leader Hitler and Commander Mussolini held discussions, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, General Keitel, Italian General Graziani, and State Secretary Mazzolini were also present. All participants reaffirmed their determination to win the war and achieve the political goals of the Tripartite Pact. German Ambassador to Italy Rahn and Italian Ambassador to Germany Anfuso also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: After the meeting, German Leader Hitler and Italian Commander inspected various divisions of the Italian army at a training center and expressed their appreciation for their equipment and training.

<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The recent rumors of free gold trading in Shanghai are purely unfounded. Gold, before the Incident, had already been nationalized. After the Incident, because gold was not used as the basis of currency, the previous practice was not followed. However, because it had not completely left the position of currency standard, the authorities have always taken a supervisory attitude towards gold transactions to prevent speculators from manipulating it, which would stimulate prices and affect people's livelihood. Therefore, in early February of this year, a large number of gold speculators in Shanghai were arrested. Moreover, the Trade Control Committee had specially written to the Ministry of Finance in October of last year to request an explanation on this matter, and it was replied that: "In the future, gold can be freely traded, and there is no need to restrict prices." To clarify this truth, a Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zhong Jiaxiang, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. According to him: Gold had been nationalized before the Incident, but since the return to the capital, because gold was not used as the basis of currency, the previous practice was not followed. However, in order to prevent speculative manipulation and other behaviors, restrictions were imposed. As for future transaction situations, they will still be considered in light of the circumstances and supervised and corrected at any time to avoid causing unexpected adverse effects.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news: The Eastern Front seems to be in a state of preparation. According to German sources, "The German and Soviet armies are working hard to replenish their rear forces. A great war is about to break out, and the situation is extremely dangerous." According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet army is now preparing for a summer offensive, which will echo the Second Front in Western Europe, and a large-scale operation will be launched on the Eastern Front. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet army may attack the two salient points of Stanislaviv in southeastern former Poland and Narva in Estonia. The recent fierce counterattack by the German army is also for this reason. According to German sources on the 24th: The German and Hungarian armies have advanced to Stanislaviv and built solid positions.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Yuan Jinkai, Minister of the Imperial Household of Manchuria, resigned due to old age and physical weakness, which was approved.

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese and Indian armies besieging the Imphal Plain captured Moirang (a vital point south of Imphal), they suppressed Tiddimpal (a vital point in front of Palel) on the 20th. They are now advancing towards the area 8 kilometers southeast of Palel, pressing the enemy and actively strengthening their posture to break into the Palel position. In addition, the spearhead units of the Japanese and Indian armies, in the offensive and defensive battles of the Imphal outer defense line, encircled the enemy's rear and cut off the connection between the enemy's fortress groups in the northern mountainous area, isolating them completely. On the other hand, the enemy army on the Bishenpur side has been severely restricted in its advance due to the rising water level of Loktak Lake. The Japanese and Indian armies are launching a fierce attack from three directions, and the enemy army is about to collapse, with the entire front line on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Southeast Anti-Axis Command announced on the 24th: Since April 21, the Japanese and Indian armies have been engaged in fierce battles in the hilly area on the Palel-Tamu road. The Japanese army occupied a hill on the 23rd and is still continuing its offensive.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Entire Nation Unites in Effort, Advancing Towards a Common Goal: Director Mei Delivers Instructions on Behalf of Chairman Wang <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Chairman, esteemed representatives, distinguished guests, today marks the first day of the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association. Chairman Wang was unable to attend due to illness, and has sent me, his brother, as a representative. I am extremely delighted to have this opportunity to gather with you all. Reflecting on the Second Congress, held last year in Tokyo, only five countries formally participated: China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam. This year's congress sees the formal participation of representatives from the Philippines and Burma, in addition to China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam. Whether in substance or in spirit, this fully demonstrates that the scope of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expanding day by day, its influence is growing day by day, its construction work is progressing day by day, and the unity of the East Asian peoples is becoming stronger day by day. In a word, the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia is becoming brighter day by day. This bright future is entirely bestowed upon us by the sacred Greater East Asia War. When we speak of the Greater East Asia War, we cannot but express our infinite respect for our ally, Japan, the pioneer of this sacred war.</p>
<p>My observation of this East Asia Medical Congress is that it is more than just an academic gathering. Although its nature concerns academic exchange, its significance is truly an unprecedented union of the spirit of the East Asian peoples with historical significance. However, I also harbor a regret regarding this congress, which those present should also feel, and that is the absence of representatives from India. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo last year, Burma's representative, Chief Executive Ba Maw, publicly declared: "East Asia is still incomplete… No one mentions the Orient without thinking of India. If India is not free, the freedom of East Asia is out of the question." Today, amidst this grand gathering, I want to first draw everyone's attention to this.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a matter of life and death for all East Asian peoples. Now is the most intense period of the war. Although the future holds boundless hope, and although we are confident that final victory will surely belong to us with the united solidarity of the East Asian peoples, we cannot afford to be purely optimistic. We must not rely solely on internal strength and forget the arduous and prolonged struggle. In this era of fierce competition, not to advance is to retreat, but to retreat is a dead end. Today, this era leaves us no room for retreat. We must endure all kinds of suffering to complete the Greater East Asia War. However, amidst the suffering, we must also analyze it. There are many things that are unavoidable and should be endured, and there are many things that can be avoided. We must summon the courage to accept the unavoidable and endurable suffering, and we must try to avoid what can be avoided. What is unavoidable and should be endured? For example, during wartime, everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation will be greatly restricted. Husbands joining the army, wives becoming displaced, and so on. From the standpoint of the nation, such suffering is truly unavoidable and should be endured. What can be avoided? The object of your research is a good example, in other words, diseases. Diseases are the greatest of human suffering. During wartime, diseases are bound to be more prevalent than usual. This kind of suffering can be avoided. Modern medicine should not only pay attention to treatment, but especially to prevention. The so-called "treating before the disease manifests" will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Our work in preventing diseases is not only for the soldiers at the front, but also for the general public, especially in remote and neglected rural areas. This is the foundational work during wartime, and nothing is more important.</p>
<p>I have always placed great importance on those who study medicine, and I enjoy interacting with them, because they have scientific minds and can clearly analyze everything inside and outside the bodies of ordinary people and patients. They have deep research into the treatment and prevention of various diseases. This kind of analysis and research, viewed in a broader perspective, can even serve as reference material for governing the country. The country is like a body, with a heart, limbs, sensory organs, and life. It also has diseases and sometimes endures external suffering. A person governing a country must be decisive, meticulous, and passionate, much like a doctor. Therefore, the methods you usually use and the insights you have gained can be integrated and applied in many ways, not just contributing solely to the medical field. The ancient Chinese saying "A good prime minister is like a good doctor" is indeed very true.</p>
<p>This congress is the East Asia Medical Congress. When we mention "East Asia," we immediately feel that we are all one family. Your usual painstaking research is for the sake of East Asia, and your coming from afar to seek academic exchange is also for the sake of East Asia. After painstaking research and mutual communication, progress will surely be rapid. This progress is the progress of the entire East Asia. Although this congress lasts only four days, the fraternal feelings between us can be further enhanced, and our spirit can be further united. I predict that the next congress will have even more participating countries and an even greater number of representatives. This all depends on our efforts. The more we strive and the harder we work, the more the suffering of the East Asian peoples can be reduced. The more we strive for one minute and the harder we work for one minute, the more the lives of the East Asian peoples can be extended by one minute. The construction of Greater East Asia and the liberation of the East Asian peoples require the united and continuous efforts of all East Asian peoples, advancing towards a common goal.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Supreme Economic Advisor Ogura Discusses Economic Policies: Elaborates on Ambitions During Meeting with Journalist Group in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Mr. Masatsune Ogura, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 25th) from Nanjing, planning to hold sincere talks with relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities and economic circles in Shanghai to exchange opinions. Mr. Ogura also met with a group of Chinese journalists at the Hotel Metropole at 5:30 PM yesterday. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, he gave a detailed speech on the current economic situation and his ambitions for future economic policies. Key excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech</p>
<p>I was here last July as the head of a Japanese private economic mission, and now I am here in Shanghai as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government. I feel extremely fortunate. The recovery of Shanghai's economy is one of the most important issues for China's economy today. Given the importance of Shanghai's economy, I plan to visit Shanghai more often in the future to have sincere talks with the Shanghai economic community. China is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. Therefore, its economic future is truly limitless. Unfortunately, in the past, China's resources were mostly utilized and developed by Britain and America. In the future, they will be used to defeat Britain and America and build Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important issue for China's economy is how to transform China's human and material resources into war power and how to stabilize people's livelihoods. Although this is extremely difficult, the goal of both China and Japan is to build a new order based on Eastern ethics. Therefore, despite the many difficulties ahead, we will still strive to achieve it. Wartime economy requires mobility and joint efforts by officials and civilians. However, each country has different national conditions. Therefore, we will carefully review the policies to find the most effective methods. As an advisor, I am not responsible for economic policy. Therefore, the future operation of China's economy must be advanced by the creativity and responsibility of the National Government authorities and the Chinese economic community. Therefore, I deeply hope that Chinese officials and civilians will redouble their efforts to develop the new China.</p>
<p>Answering Questions from Reporters</p>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers then raised questions about economic and control issues. Mr. Ogura answered in detail as follows: Regarding the price issue, he said that there are two policies to solve the price issue. One is to increase production, and the other is to reduce transportation. Regarding the former, he believes that in addition to increasing necessities such as food, it is also necessary to solve the transportation problems between various regions. If the production volume increases and goods circulate mutually in various regions, the price will naturally fall. Regarding the latter, he believes that there is much room for contracting the currency in circulation in the market. In the future, efforts will be made to improve past shortcomings so that prices can fall and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. Regarding the controlled economy issue, since it is now wartime, the goal of the controlled economy should focus on enhancing war power, and human and material resources should be concentrated and contributed to the war. However, the methods of the controlled economy are not immutable and must be changed according to the situation. As far as China is concerned, China has its own unique national conditions, habits, and traditions. Therefore, the control methods must be completely suitable and objectively analyzed. Otherwise, the stricter the control, the more the materials will be lacking, which is contrary to the original meaning of control. Therefore, in the future, we will study the reasons for the failure of the past controlled economy and hope to correct past mistakes to improve it. Regarding the Shanghai stock issue, the original motive for issuing stocks was to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, but it must not be used as a speculative object, which will greatly affect the financial industry. In the future, those who engage in speculative behavior should be corrected to make them tend to normal transactions. Regarding the question "The inflation in Chongqing is quite high. Does it affect the financial situation in Central China?" the Director of Economic Consultants of the National Economic Committee, Mr. Aramaki (Manager of the Bank of Japan), answered at the press conference: When the Central Reserve Bank of China was established, I was very concerned about its currency operation. Later, I felt that the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes was very stable and smooth. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese people's confidence in the Central Reserve Bank notes has been unanimously firm. Just now, I heard that the inflation in Chongqing, if the Chinese government and people can cooperate closely, it will not be affected. Japan is determined to provide full support.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Extension of Deadline for Grain Merchant Registration <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Bureau, acting on orders, has been handling the registration of grain merchants. The announcement has already been made and implemented, and the deadline has passed. However, there are still quite a few merchants who have failed to comply with the deadline for applying for registration. In order to show consideration, the Bureau has specially approved an extension of the deadline to the 15th of next month. All merchants engaged in the rice and grain business and miscellaneous grain merchants within the city area who have not registered with the Bureau, or who have registered but have changed owners, increased capital, or relocated, should comply with the deadline to apply for registration with the Bureau. If they continue to delay deliberately, they will be punished or ordered to suspend business.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth: District One to Begin Distribution First <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of temporary rationing of cotton cloth, all 3,090,000 "Cloth Purchase Certificates" have been [omitted character] by the Shanghai Special Municipal Cotton Cloth Trade Association and stamped with the numbers of each retailer. They have been submitted to the Commercial Control Committee and forwarded to the Municipal Government, which has sent a letter to the District Public Office requesting them to check the population, collect the certificates, and distribute them to households. It was reported yesterday that the number of 3,096,000 was printed according to the population of District One and the old eight districts. If the other six districts are included, the "Cloth Certificates" will have to be printed in addition, and the number of cloth pieces may also have to be supplemented. Therefore, the household cloth distribution may start with District One (including the old eight districts), and the other districts will be held in succession. It is learned that if there are no obstacles in issuing the "Cloth Purchase Certificates," they can be sold as scheduled in early May.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of permanent blackout regulations on the 3rd of last month, petty thieves have seized the opportunity to become active, and robbery cases have occurred frequently. It was not until the 18th of last month that the Laoza Police Authority captured the main criminal in the street robbery case and arrested other criminals in Room 41 of the Southeast Hotel, including Jia Yihai (25 years old, from Shaoxing), Wang Bingnan (22 years old, from Zhenjiang), Yang Genlin (19 years old, from Shanghai), Gu Rongfu (18 years old, from Tongzhou), Gong Wenbin (21 years old, from Jiading), and Yan Jinlin (22 years old, from Shaoxing). It was found that these criminals had committed more than ten robbery cases. The criminals have now been transferred to the Security Command for strict punishment under wartime criminal law. When the criminals were arrested, a 32-caliber Spanish-style pistol and other weapons were seized and handed over to the Security Command.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Decision to Stop Electricity Supply to Those Who Waste Electricity: China Water and Electricity Company Takes Decisive Action <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental New Daily on the 25th, the China Water and Electricity Company has formulated regulations on electricity consumption in order to enhance combat power. Although the consumption results by the end of March were quite good, some people still wasted electricity, which had a considerable impact on the overall results. Since April, the results of electricity conservation have deteriorated again. Therefore, under the order of the Chang Authority, the China Water and Electricity Company has decided to impose the severe penalty of "stopping electricity supply" on those consumers who do not cooperate. On the 21st, the company issued a warning of "imminent implementation of electricity supply suspension" to more than 1,000 consumers in Shanghai with poor performance. Among them are the most luxurious hotels and hotels in Shanghai, such as Hua Xi, [omitted character] Zhong, Jinmen, International, Xinya, and Broadway. The company originally hoped that consumers would automatically practice electricity saving within the possible range, but there were still quite a few people who held the attitude of "paying more for exceeding the quota, and money can solve the problem" and did not self-discipline. These uncooperative people who hinder the enhancement of combat power should be severely punished with resolute measures, so it has been decided to stop the electricity supply. Although there is no deadline for this warning, the company plans to implement it by the end of this month and stated that "if consumers can truly become aware and establish an electricity saving plan and are willing to implement it sincerely in the future, there is still room for consideration; otherwise, if they think that exceeding the quota can be solved by paying money, there is no other way than to stop the electricity supply." In addition, the company will deal with consumers who exceed the limit twice or more and are considered to have no intention of reducing consumption by severe punishment methods.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Illegal Pawnbroking in Nanshi Spreads to District One <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>After all the gambling houses in Nanshi were ordered to close, all the illegal pawnbrokers near the gambling houses mostly stopped accepting pledges and waited for redemption, and they were about to close down. However, recently, some pawnbrokers came up with the idea of extending to District One and continuing to open businesses. Transformed commercial firms on Taishan Road and Caishi Road have opened one after another, exploiting the poor with high interest rates. It is hoped that the authorities will take a stand in safeguarding the livelihoods of the poor and strictly crack down on such illegal pawnbrokers, which will greatly benefit the poor.</p>
