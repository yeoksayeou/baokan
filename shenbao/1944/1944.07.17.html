<p>社評</p>
<h3>社會虛症</h3>
<p>醫家對於病症，有所謂虛症實症之分。實症者體實歡實而有局部之病態，其處方也易而危險性小。虛症者體質虛弱，雖病態亦可呈顧於局部，然缺乏自力更生之機能，每不醫藥罔效而陷於絕症。今之社會病態多矣，社會一有機體也，須審病之虛實而後能虛方卜凶吉。惟其病態過多，無從一一診斷，加以論列，茲略舉數端，以概其餘：</p>
<p>生產　中國地大物博人口眾多，人皆羨我而我亦以此自負，則是先天未嘗不足也明甚。但農業方面以殼賤而棄耕，或閭閻不安而徙亡。重要食糧之產量與日供减。風調兩順依然不免於　　之現象，其癥結固不止一端，絕非一二農業專家所可挽救。工業方面則以交通閉塞，使原料無來源，產品無去路，加以原動力不足支配，成本會計無法建立，以致大小工廠或未能盡量發揮共能力或竟在停頓之中，此亦絕非一二技師所能為力。</p>
<p>電力節約之口號確乎層出不窮，然多偏重於家用及工廠，一則為數較微，一則有妨正業，而娛樂塲所未見力加緊縮。宴會節約之布告長篇累牘言之諄諄，然一次實會可用兩席，加以營酒菜業者，亦善解人意，以贈菜為名而收共實惠，顧客病主反以此沾沾自喜。</p>
<p>暴利　富豪原非病態，百姓足君孰與不足，求萬民之富庶固為治國者之基本原則，然今之奮棄者大都由於獲取暴利或從事剝削，一言以蔽之，吮健人之血以自肥，而非有所貢獻於大我造福人羣以取正當之利潤。損人利己已非道德所許，加以悖入悖出徒增消耗而斷喪元氣。</p>
<p>窮困　無一技之長，言不忠信，行不篤敬之輩，受窮困之厄理也，且事之宜也，不特無害於社會反足以資警戒。然今之處於窮困者，幾皆薄有技能良心未泯，確乎以其精力服務於社會，乃至上無以事下無以畜，終日遑遑惟衣食之是慮，使共一腔然血耗竭無餘。</p>
<p>旱潦災荒不足慮，技術不精不足憂，惟其虛偽敷衍因循茍且，道德淪亡良心湮滅，口是心非言行不一，太阿倒置瓦缶雷鳴，乃至殺人不見血暗自屠戮，是誠社會之虛症。若不及早投以苦口之榮，則厥疾不能瘳，而釀成不可挽回之絕症。</p>
<p>是非之心人皆有之，各自行徑亦惟有各自能加以最適當之評陟。淸夜平旦之時，孰無一縷天良縈繞於力寸，向之呼籲而判共功過。無奈慾海波濤洶湧澎湃，非大有力者必不能振拔而終於屈伏。</p>
<p>醫治社會虛症之特效藥，日擴大柔弱之心聲而發正己之宏願！</p>
<h3>谷大使深致哀悼張故部長今大殮　遺體遵囑決舉行火葬儀式</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　國府司法行政部部長張一鵬氏，在滬逝世，各界　聞噩耗，深致哀悼。盟邦駐華特命全權大使谷正之氏，聞此消息後，即派大使館淸水書記官，赴我外交部褚部長官邸敬表哀悼，褚部長當即向國府及張故部長家屬謹為轉達。谷大使並飭日大使館駐滬事務所就近致送花圈，以示弔暗。司法行政部張部長逝世後，褚外畏張院長特電弔慰，茲録電文如下：張　傳部長夫人禮　：噩耗傳聞，驚悉雲摶先生在滬臥病逝世，追悼老友，不勝哀痛，尙　節哀為要，褚民誼張　叩，十六日。</p>
<p>司法行政部部長張一　，不幸於前（十五）日逝世，張氏生前功在國家社會，噩耗傳來，中外同聲軫悼，這體已定今日下午二時在膠州路萬國殯儀館大殮，惟張氏在日向主火葬，其家族為氏奉遺命，故決定於今日大殮後即在靜安寺公墓舉行火葬儀式云。</p>
<p>財政部長周佛海氏昨親往英國殯儀館弔奠張故部長。又李贊侯先生晚辭云：「入地獲救衆生，我敬其勇；如尼山作司寇，天不假年。」</p>
<p>節約協會掉念張氏</p>
<p>上海市節約協會，昨晚舉行第二二次循例廣播，由該會常務理事兼　記長　風演講，原擬講題為「眞節約與假節約」，旋以該會理事長張一鵬氏，突告逝世，特　時更易倡節約運動之經過，有所報告。演詞略謂：「本會理事長張一　先生之逝，殊令吾人不勝哀悼。張氏生前為人，對國家政治而言，乃是個廉潔曰持，努力奉公的好官更。對私人而言，則是個能克己為人，捨私為公的好國民。綜張氏一生的為人為事，有三個特徵可以提出來一講，氏維持司法尊嚴，提倡廉潔政治。氏嚴主禁煙葬毒。氏提倡節約運動。尤其後者，終張氏之生，不但是努力倡導者，且也是自身切實力行者。値茲國事日趨艱難，人心日趨下流之今日，張氏之　然逝去，實國家最大之損失，站在節約運動立塲，失此導師，實不勝悲慨哀痛之至一云云。最後魯氏並建讓為紀念張氏之逝，希望將來能集欵創辦一有益於國家人民積極性之教育事業，或社會事業，以垂永久。各方致敬儀體，罐可能勿涉浪費，以求實際，以期符合張　生前提倡節約服務社會之一番苦心。</p>
<h3>日空軍部隊　重創敵美機　擊落四架擊毀三架</h3>
<p>日軍某基地十五日中央社電日空軍某機　於十四日午後，得悉敵P67型戰鬥機十數架，將向華中方面出擊之情報，乃即出動，於午後六時半，於丹竹西北攻擊未着陸之敵機，當擊落其四架，擊毀三架，日機安返。</p>
<p>大陸空戰日佔優勢</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地十六日中央社電中國大陸方面日空軍某部長，頃述詳大陸空戰概况如次：駐渝美空軍為完成其重要任務，於桂林哀方宏大地區，建設無數基地群，行將竣事。日軍突然先發制人，於是駐渝美空軍大為狼狽，乃撤廢東南方北方之基地羣，移主力於昆明至重慶一帶，一方將有力機動兵力埋伏於桂林·芷江·丹竹·及柳州各基地，窺伺日軍第一綫之間隙。由此看來，駐渝美空軍在中國大陸所使用之戰法，殆為永久　狀作戰，即使將物資長期作海潮般進退起伏不優之作戰，日空軍則正以其雷與精神力行動　速之作戰，此次空襲芷江·桂林·丹竹方面，收獲赫赫識果，亦丙即日軍知己知彼，以精神力補足缺點之故。此種精神力與質，實為壓倒渝方物質力與量之唯一利器，渝方物量雖相當　當，但其質極為惡劣，吾人相信最近將必能殲滅全部駐渝美空軍云。</p>
<p>桂林緊張人心慌亂</p>
<p>廣州十六日中央社電中國大陸之日軍南北呼應，展開猛攻，於是廣西首府桂林情勢，驟形緊張。該地各嚴關團體均張皇失措。據渝方十四日廣播稱，桂林工業公會會員，頃根據中央指令，組成戰時服務團，協力疏散避難民眾，移動工業重要機器，更協助渝軍破壞橋頭等重要設施。</p>
<p>渝軍使用毒瓦斯戰</p>
<p>湖南日軍前基地十六日中央社電六月下旬，渝方　　日軍使且毒瓦斯，掩　第九戰區慘敗，然渝軍男於六月二十日使用毒瓦斯戰。六月十十四日，渝脢十師在　陵被日軍包圍時曾使用，日軍對此已有充分防備。</p>
<p>反攻安仁渝軍重創</p>
<p>湖南前綫十五日中央社電自拂曉與企業　安仁之渝軍展開激戰以來，由於日軍職術之巧，故渝軍已成袋中之鼠。至十一十二兩日，雙方經拉鋸戰之後渝渝軍己　重創。上月末渝軍欲乘日軍攻克攸縣安仁舊衡陽西南地區陣地，而繼續南進之際，企圖一舉即將安仁收復，遂將兵力集中於該處之周圍地區，而於十一日拂曉開始反攻。並於大砲之掩護下，由軍山（安仁西方五公里）分水北方六公里之西北二方面進擊，然　日軍予以迎頭出擊後，至十二日黃昏，渝軍二師軍全部殲滅，並被日軍團獲輕重機槍及手溜彈等甚夥。目前日軍對之，刻正續行迫擊中。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十六日中央社電自粵漢鐵路南方山岳地帶南進中之日軍，於九日佔領金蘭寺後，隨處掃蕩敗殘渝軍第四軍及其他部隊。湘鄉方面第九戰區司令薛岳指揮下之第十五師，仍執拗企圖奪回該地，試作逆襲。連日作戰，經日軍猛烈反擊，遺棄屍體二百餘具，是役更俘虜三十四名，鹵獲武器槍砲亦甚夥，日軍僅死傷二各。又南進先　部隊，九日正午於湘鄉黃陂（衡陽西方十公里）附近，發現渝軍第九十八師約六百，午飯中，遂即突人，完全將其擊滅。</p>
<p>渝軍死守衡陽情狀</p>
<p>衡陽市外十六日中央社電衡陽城內之兩師渝軍，於日軍重壓下已瀕危殆，茲據渝軍俘處及投降者，供述渝軍死守舊陽之急切情形，及陷落前夕之慘狀如次：甲，二等兵，余為五十歲之老兵，然於軍隊中，尚有十二歲之少年者，內以十七歲及十九歲為最多。吾等於廣東入隊以來，為時僅三月，今即與日軍作戰，實北吾人所能想像者。日軍開始國攻後第三日，食糧即告用盡，據聞城內設有多數糧倉，然對吾等並無供給，甚有兩三日空腹不食，繼續抗戰。迨得知軍長上等兵，去秋常德作戰，曾與日軍交戰一次，此次　戰伊始，即失戰意，　長官薛岳所謂「日軍放棄長沙，已仃退去」之口詞而死守衛陽，薛岳於日軍開始團攻後，仍槍口此點，反　　戰，而　等所最信賴者，　為堅固之防　陣地，與駐渝美空軍。我軍陣地雖極堅固，然悉被日軍佔領，日空軍不分晝夜，轟炸吾等，致全軍咸里神經衰弱狀態，因美軍放棄機塲遁逃，吾等死守衡陽，實無意義。丙，下士官，衡陽最近美國色彩濃厚，美人以空襲日本為招脾之洋洋自得，美人駕駛員之輕浮行動，凡有心人，無不為之哀息。此外衡陽更有美國軍士之棉布，自來水筆，鉛筆等文具，及食糧品化妝品等，汜濫市上。市當局於日軍己行靠近之廿三日，突設出動散命令，　　移動物資，故有大批物資堆積如山，已成為軍隊掠奪之目標。要人富家等均已脫逃，榆林多數市民於我等近入市街時，仍殘留若干。渠等因見軍隊掠奪橫行，故對收等怨恨異常云。</p>
<h3>湖南銻鑛資源　入日軍掌握</h3>
<p>湖南前綫某基地十六日中央社電湖南日軍攻陷安仁未陽等要區，自粵漢綫中部山岳地帶猛進之部隊，漸迫至松柏（衡陽南方約五十公里）水口山岳地帶附近，擁有製鉛約百噸及製鉛工塲之地，渝軍已相　狼狽，大最資材及工塲設施，已人日軍掌握。八日沿粵漢路進擊之日軍，於水　西北地區發見　鑛產地，獲得製品准積如山，此地為製倲　富資源之湖南中樞，故渝方抗戰培養資源，甚至為世界資源之地城，已次第八日軍掌握，給予重慶之打擊固大。即仰望此種舉要軍需資源之美國，亦受極大打擊。</p>
<h3>襲雅浦島敵機　擊落十三架</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電據中部太平洋日軍某基地電：雅浦島日軍航空部隊戰鬥機隊，十四日曾擊落來襲敵機八架，日方並無損失，更於十五。擊落敵機二架擊毀其三架，是役日軍損失自爆及未歸　機機各一架。</p>
<p>西南太平洋日軍某基地十六日中央社電斑達海西蘭島東部布魯，十四日曾有敵大型機數架來襲，該地日軍當與交戰，擊落敵機四架擊毀一架，卒將之擊退，是役日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>美軍猛攻桑洛　展開拉鋸戰　河東敵待機而動</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：美第一軍今晨大舉進攻桑洛五十一號高地，已於昨夜被美軍敢死隊佔領。桑洛運東及東北之高地對美軍行動尤為重要，美第五軍及第十九車已參加新攻勢人戰。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：前日諾曼第戰綫之東半，祇有局部戰事，而西半之美軍則續攻頗力，德軍沉着應付，敵未能逞。沿海區內之德軍大部向南拓展數公里，</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德軍前綫消息：美軍於諾曼第梳頭堡下繼續猛攻，因遭德軍反擊，未獲何等成果。英軍於橋頭堡東　似準備展開攻勢，刻於克恩區集結大軍，但以上攻勢是否俟奧納河東實行新登陸後再有展開，尚未判明。美軍損失逐日增加，例如美步丘第二十九師進擊匕猶桑洛地區傷亡三千之衆，（內陣亡一千）同時兵器損失亦激增，過去二十四小時已喪失戰車七十一輛，對戰車砲二十門，彈　車五輛。德降洛傘部隊出以反攻，鹵獲對戰車砲二十門。彈藥車五輛，並利用此等兵器繼續反攻，已予敵軍重創。目下　洛地區正展開拉鋸式激戰，美軍雖曾企圖通過巴猶桑洛公路進向塞米里，然受創後，已被德軍擊破。美軍於桑加德耶員爾公路西方以奧摩森林為目標南進成功，卡倫坦。佩里耶最爾亦正展開激烈爭奪戰。</p>
<h3>義綫西翼　戰事吃緊　德軍採避離行動</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央八社電　德國通訊社訊：義戰綫反軸心軍出動全部兵力，繼續壓迫西方地區之德軍後衛部隊，戰綫起自里維納南方，經勃基勃尼直至阿　茲奧，其中以聖基那諾方面美第五軍之攻擊最為執拗，勃基勃尼感威曾，德軍頃自已該市撤退。又中部阿雷茲奧地區及蒂柏河流城之卡斯迭羅方面仍有激戰，刻該方英軍之攻勢，已被德軍擊退。此外東部地區布拉其阿諾至費洛特拉奧間之德軍前哨部隊，已自穆索奈河北岸撤退。亞特里亞沿岸地區英軍無何進展。</p>
<h3>土耳其人民　不願戰爭</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　海通社訊：土國議員兼名記者蕯達克，在阿克　報論稱，「無一國好戰，故土國不參戰，並無皆何損失，有認上國對此次戰爭應採較為策極態度，實不知其用意何在，戰爭乃國防最後手段」。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：德外部發言人今日提及英美報章謂，英美要求士耳其與德絕交，並斷絕經濟關係，日希望土國參戰，但未提及土政府之反響如何。亦未證實蘇聯外交人民部委員長維　斯基究竟抵達士京參加此項談判與否。</p>
<h3>首期廢金屬　徵集竣事</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　際此大東亞戰爭決勝階段，我國上下對於協力最後勝利，無不一致努力。尤以自今年春當局公布收集廢金屬辦法以後，各省市地方無不紛起響應。茲悉江蘇省各縣及附購機關，自本年初開始，迄平六月底，為收集廢金屬第一期，現已届滿，業已將所有收集物品，為便利計，就近移送有關方面收領，除呈報行政院外，並咨實業部查照。聞以後將　績第二期搜集，刻正根據中央頒布辦法，及其補充辦法計劃，一俟具體，即開始收集工作。</p>
<h3>東綫大戰中心　移泰諾波爾　格羅特諾城德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫中路特別泰諾波爾及魯資克兩地區之德軍閃避行動，均能按照計劃實施，該兩區以南之德軍雖受蘇軍强力壓迫，仍能固守陣地。至泰諾波爾西北及魯資克運西，蘇軍以大批生力軍（步兵及坦克隊）參加作戰，德軍仍能獲得充分的完成防禦，蘇軍集中輕重砲火，尤其無數新迫擊砲大肆轟擊，但至傍晚其勢已暫趨緩弛，不足輕重之缺口數處，均經德軍反攻堵合。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：格羅特諾（Grodno）區蘇軍於增援後，重復自北方及尾門河西岸對該鎮攻擊，經極劇烈傚戰後，德軍在蘇軍壓迫下撤離該鎮，各項軍事設施均加以破壞。</p>
<p>科學兵器</p>
<h3>電波探知機</h3>
<p>此次大戰新出現的，且最新奇而最引人入勝的兵器，就是電波探知機。前此的電波，是當作口和耳朵的。然而科學的進步，又使電波竟替代了眼睛。此次大戰之初，英國受到德國空軍的激烈轟炸，而只是徒呼奈何。但經過一年後，德國空軍的轟炸，突然减少了。這是因為英國全部佈滿了監視網。常德國轟炸機一離基地時，縱令望遠鏡看不見，聽看機聽不到，但電波的眼睛，萊已淸淸楚楚地看到獨國飛機的樣子。於是英國戰鬥機立刻起飛，高射砲隊員立刻就位，而這樣以逸待勞的應戰姿能完全準備妥常，所以德國轟炸機隊的電　，就增加困難了。電波的眼睛，即電波探知機，是在最受空襲痛苦的英國完成的。但這種發明，是在開戰五年前開始的。</p>

<p>電波探知機究竟是什麼呢？為解答這一問題，首先應當知道電波的本體。電波在物理學上稱作電磁波，是空間電氣碰氣的振動現象，這雖然是特別難的現象，但我們眼睛所能看到的光，赤外綫，紫外藉，X光綫等，全都是粗同的電磁波之一抓。但電波與光，在波長方而是有很大差別的。今日無綫電通信所應用的電波之皮長，最長　數千公尺至最短一公尺，同時最近又發明了數公分的極短電波。但眼睛所能看到的光之波長，短至一公絲的一萬分之四或七，因此光與電波在許多點上，性質是不同的。電波　到無論濃厚的電務，都可以自由穿過。</p>
<p>此外對於光　使是不透明的，但對於電波即為透明的。橡皮和木材等是電氣的絕想　體，就是這個關係。此外電波和光，也有性質相同的點。光碰到固體固然反射，但電波碰到大地和水而，金屬等，也是反射的性質。</p>
<p>昨夜的爆裂聲，雖然聽得見，但飛機看不見的時候，探照燈的光綫向空中一照，其中就會很淸楚地看到飛機的影踪。這是因為探照燈的光，在機體上反射而映於我們眼　的關係。現在不談探照燈的光，而以電波的光芒投射。電波也照出飛機的影十來，但其反射波是眼睛所直接不能看到的。假如用電波的眼睛來看，是很淸是地司以看得出來。電波探知機，就是根據電波的探照燈和電波的眼睛作成的。電波的探照燈，是無綫電發音機之一種，電波的眼睛，就是收音機的一種</p>
<p>探知機的原理</p>
<p>再就電波探知機的原理，稍微詳細地加以解釋。電波探知機能使用超短波式極超短波的電波。電波愈是波長很短，則愈益集中於一個方向投射，同時對於飛機那樣電波看來，對於極小物體的反射能率就特別大。用電波探知機，並不是像用眼睛一樣能看見敵機，而是用下列方法判斷敵機來的方向和距離的。從探知機的發音空中綫上，向四而八方的空中發射出電波的光芒。敵機如　進這一光芒，則碰到機體的電波，即行反射，於是探知機的受音機就立刻感覺出來。此時並非由發音機不　地發射電波，而是有一定的時間間隔，間歇地發射信號。所以收音機也是收同一間歇的信號。同時反射電波之外，從發音機方面也直接感覺到來的電波。收音機上並設有擴音機，而有一種管連接着。這個部份是可以稱作電波眼睛的網膜，收到的信號，在這個綱膜裹表現出圖一樣的形狀來。圖中的兩個突起，即從發音機直接達到受音機的信號，而中問低窪突起，就是敵機來的反射電波。二者突起的間隔，是表示一個信號與下一個信號間的時間間隔。中間的突起，是表示第一個信號對敵機反射回來間的時間經過。</p>
<p>現在信號與信號間的間隔是一秒的千分之一。假定兩端的突起間隔為十公分，左端和中間的突起間隔為六公分，而發射的電波，反射回來的時間，則為一千分一秒的十分之六，即一萬分之六秒。電汲在一秒間前進三十萬公里，一萬分之六秒所前進的距離，是一百八十公里，但這是往返的距離，所以只是一去，即從探知機到敵機，就可以知道為其一半，即九十公里。</p>
<p>警戒機標定機</p>
<p>前電波探知機中有警戒機與標定機二種。前者田於探知敵機從遠方前來，而後者則用於照準眼睛所看下見的飛機的。美國在英國發明不久，即輸入其技術，而作成美國式者，立刻交與龐大的無綫電工業，開始製造電波兵器，同時又動員普通無綫電愛好　，實行迅遉發成管理員。大東亞戰爭開始時，業已配備於各據點，當我們陸軍飛機偷襲夏威夷時，根據他們的報告，可以知道他們在數十分鐘前就發現了。在昭南（新嘉坡）和克雷赫德配備的，曾被我們皇軍所鹵獲，於是其稱造完全暴露於我們日本人之前。</p>
<p>技術準備成熟</p>
<p>那末我們日本究竟怎樣呢？現在關於技術的準備，業已成熟了。這因為電視術的研究已經完成了。電波探知機的技術，與電視術的技術是完全相同的。現在我國也製造出來並不劣於敵人的優秀機，這是使我們胆壯的一件事，電波探知機的發明，使戰法一變，竟使過去一向的　襲成為不可能了。但目下也正在計劃這種探知機的對抗策。英國飛機空襲漢堡的時候，曾散播金屬片，這種方法是想迷電波眼睛的。超電波是有直進性的，而利用達不到水平綫下的性質，使用超低空飛行的方法，這己經成稱常　了。本　飛機也因為　動機及其他部份仍有金塲，所以使電波探知　感覺不出來，是不可能的。（橫田淸一郎者）（季譯自六月二十八日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討</h3>
<p>一手交貨一手交錢</p>
<p>茲擬續論修正行政收買的方法。關於一手交貨，一手交錢的必要，試介紹實際目觀交換實情的人們的談話如次：</p>
<p>收買的代價與交換物資，向來被中間人惡用，或用不正當手段取得後不交付於農民們。索局有　於此，乃於本年三四月間實行即刻交換的方式。</p>
<p>因商號不準備現金，僅交付實物後即就歸途的農民們的臉色，和當塲一手交錢一手交貨而歸去的農民們的臉色，極淸楚地可覺出不同。前者是商號用廉價收買米，至於幾時付欵則不知道，於是疑心不要是欺騙吧，因而不安之色，溢於言表。在後者，賣出價格狐比市價錢，但因當塲就可　鎭。所以很安心。</p>
<p>不論治安的情形如何，今後應實施這方法。以上是在無錫聽到的話，在蘇州也聽到同探的話。在常熱又目觀有許多農民，他們的七百二十元米欵中有二百元尚未收到。然至三四月，當塲付現後，農民即非常喜悅說：</p>
<p>「先生，以後請早一點規定供出的數量。如果在收獲後，每畝五斗縱苦也額意出的。」</p>
<p>又在常熟曾聽見有人對拿稻種和白米來的農民說：</p>
<p>「還不是稻種嗎？不是食米嗎？收買到稻種和食米，　社的成績也不見得會好到那裹。如果真的沒有，自然沒法，辛苦了，請拿回去罷！來年再賣給我們。</p>
<p>農民極落淚而歸。在與新四軍，渝軍爭奪農民的農村中，採用一手交貨，一手交錢的方式，簡單地看來，實須「非常的決心」，如果宣撫工作這名稱不適用於現在，則除非商號本身帶着收買米糧特務工作隊的性格，殊難普遍的採用這方策。况且收買米糧的第一綫機構，今日以後，像樣的高度化，組織化，絕對有其必要。乘行政收買的機會而追求商業利潤的商號之活動，應速予改革。</p>
<p>農民由其原有的習慣，在靑苗時即向城鎮的米行及商人偕錢，一待收獲，即賣却米糧，雙方淸算。在戰爭後所採用的供出收買，都是與這抓制度反對的。為使農民對供出收買放心，非實行各商號負責接責任的一手交貨，一手交錢制不可。（譯自六月二十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>防犯意義及防犯工作之展望　李司法處長廣播詞</h3>
<p>本市第一警察局司法處為减少人民犯罪，　保地方治安，特設立防犯科，專司防止犯罪事件，並保障市民權益。惟坊犯工作在中國尚屬初創，市民對此工作，不甚瞭解，故特由司法處長李時雨氏於昨晚八時四十五分至九時，假大上海電台廣播「防犯意義及防犯工作之展對」，闡述頗詳，茲將原文誌錄如下。</p>
<p>親愛的上海市民同胞們：今天本人廣播的題目是「防犯意義與防犯工作的展望」，這個生疏的題目我想不一定能以引起大家的與趣，不過因為防犯這種工作，對於維持社會秩序安寗和保障人民生命財產，身體自由，及幸福之增進，關係非常重大；並且因為本人現在負責正在開始推行這個防犯工作，有許多地方需要大家研，有許多地方需要大家來協力，所以特地選定了這個題目，來和諸位一談。</p>
<p>我首光要說的什麼呌做防犯：簡單概括的說，就是為了雜持公共社會秩序安寗，防止犯罪事件的發生，詳細一點解釋，就是使沒有犯罪的人，別作違法行為，使已經犯罪受刑罰或免除刑罰的人，別重再作遠法的行為。</p>
<p>减少損失</p>
<p>還有因爲什麽要防犯？我們都知道犯罪是有刑罰制裁的，似乎用不着談防不防了。殊不知刑罰的目的是在减少和消滅犯罪的，如果能以在事前把犯罪的因素切斷，或者控制犯罪者，使犯罪的行為不至滋生和蔓延，當然用不着以刑罪制裁，就刑事政策來講，已經由報復主義鎮壓主義走到了感化主義的二十世紀的現在，沒有不認為對犯罪者處以刑割是不得已的措置。况且一個人犯了法，無論侵害的是個人法益，社會法益，或是國家法益，總是不利於國家社會的，就使那犯罪渚都能處以刑罰，國家社會已經受了損害，多了一個罪人，就减少一個好人，同樣亦是國家社會的損失。近代學者都把犯罪呌做社會病態，我們可以說，預防這種病態的感染發生，以减少個人和社會國家的損害，所以嬰防止犯罪。</p>
<p>我國自鴉片戰爭以來，社會和經濟發生了絕大的變化，人們把使有的空虛道德觀念，亦根本打破，沒有繼之以厲行法治，以致各營其私，各謀其利，對國家法律，漠視不顧，不合理的發展，以致政治不上軌道。假若有人人能知法守法，把守法成為習慣，把守法變成了道德，凡有損國家主權而遠個人私慾的不作，凡有犧牲國家體而而求個人利益的行為不作，合理的就下決心幹，不合理的下決心不去幹，一切都求合理的發展一，當然不至於積弱積貧到如此地步。</p>
<p>復興上海</p>
<p>單就上海來說，這個地位只看有錢沒有錢，有錢什麼都可以做，荊罰似乎專對付小百姓的，什麼「大亨」流氓都以不守法為榮的任所欲為，無法無天，真是罪惡淵藪。陳市長蒞任之初，便以澄淸上海為己任，他並且以上海市民的痛苦引為自己的痛苦，他也曾勗勉上海市民，要明恥奮發，來復興殘破的上海，挽救這墮落的上海。我們聽到陳市長的昭示，同時我們又親眼看見上海社會上種種錯綜複雜光怪陸離的現象，深深感到澄淸汚濁的上海，建設新的大上海，這種富有歷史性的任務，的確是極其迫切，也就是我們不可旁貸的責任。</p>
<p>本人仰體陳市長的偉大意旨，顧念自已的責任，站在担任警察司法的立塲上，時時刻刻對於上海五百萬市民生命財產身體自由等法益的保障，深恐不能完全週密，以為非把社會各罪惡層澄淸了，才能談建設，這種澄淸工作就是防犯工作。因此，在租界收回後，便計劃着如何推行此種工作，在最近奉命出國考察舊政回來，就在本局司法處設置防犯科，專司防犯計劃研究指導組織宣傳，以及保護誡護等各項防犯工作。我可以這樣報告：防犯工作在中國是初創，在上海我們以試騐的態度，以期其必收成效的決心，已經展開了，現在讓我一面單說明這各工作展開的姿態與步伐。</p>
<p>積極訓練</p>
<p>我們本着「正人先始訓練這數百名司法警察官吏，這部分人多半是過去被人怕的「包探」，在接收租界後，經我一年的訓練監督，已經都多深明大義了。不過我，恩不以此為滿足將來更要分期抽調訓練，並且招考高中或大學生訓練補充，然後淘汰冗劣，預定大約一年半期間，可以把整個上海司法警察官更改變其素質，再加以嚴密的組織，繼續不斷的在工作中予以調練，使他們在思想上知識上能力上都有了進步，知道愛民，知道守法，進一步指導人民，共同擔當防犯工作。現在我所憂慮的，是他們待遇非常菲薄，辦案費用不充分，也可以說沒有不　言的說，免不了有不正當的利用得，我正籌劃如何使他們生活安定；使辦案有充足的費用，進而獎飭有功者，使他們不枉不縱，這種事我們行政上問題然而衣食足而後知榮辱，必須先讓他們吃得飽再鞭策他們，我以為這也是防犯工作中一部份的基木工作、</p>
<p>我們知道「不教而誅」是不對的，中國人民知識過低，不要說普通人沒有法律知識，就是一般知識份于，多有對法律上不甚明暸，他們受貪官汚更剝削，詐取，不敢說話，就是想依法進行訴訟，又受惡律師或訟棍的敲詐，這是多麼慘痛的事呀。我以為普及人民法律知識，使他們知法守法，不作侵害別人的違法行為，並且使他們知道訴訟程序，一旦受了損害，可以補救，所以我們防範工作，是塲利用演講無綫電報告娛樂塲所廣告報紙雜誌種種宣傳機構，灌輸人民法律知識，同時給人民訴訟上許多便利，過去人民最怕的是到巡捕房，俗語說：「衙門向南開，有理無錢你別來，」弄得人民有冤不敢申，便姑息養奸，造成現在許多罪惡層，積惡已一深的中國社會，尤其是上海，我們必須用種種方法</p>
<p>澈底防犯</p>
<p>還有防犯工作，不但是專靠司法警察人員所不能推行得徹底，同時也行是少數人所能達成理想的，我們積極的開發防犯意義，目的是要多數人瞭解防犯工作的重要，羣起協力，才能獲得成效。要知道社會惡勢力如此猖狂，一方面因為壞人多半有組織有力量，好人無組織無力量；一方面因為一般人缺乏國家觀念，總以為政府的事與自己無關，不願協力，甚至發生對立的心理與行為，不知自己是國民一份，國家社會的好壞，與自己的關係非常密切，這固然由於公務人負不能愛護人民，不能為人民增進福利之所致，但亦有些人養成自私的心理，無論如何不肯出頭，我們要盡最大的努力，啓發一般善良人民，和我們司法警察官吏合作，有組織有計劃負擔起這防犯的工作。</p>
<p>中國積弱積貧，上海社會汚濁沉渝，陳市長本着救救國家先救地方的信念，下決心澄淸上海，以建設新上海，我們秉承他的意旨，要作這澄淸工作的先鋒，展開防犯工作，從上海出發，甚願這個工作普遍到各地。</p>

<h3>Social Debilities</h3>
<p>In medical science, diseases are divided into debility and repletion. Repletion indicates a strong constitution with localized symptoms, making prescriptions straightforward and less risky. Debility, on the other hand, signifies a weak constitution where, although symptoms may appear localized, the ability for self-healing is lacking, often rendering medication ineffective and leading to terminal illness. Present-day society is rife with ailments. Society is an organism, and one must discern the nature of its ailments—whether of debility or repletion—before prescribing a remedy and predicting its outcome. However, given the multitude of ailments, it is impossible to diagnose and discuss each one individually. Here, I will briefly mention a few to exemplify the rest:</p>
<p>Production: China is vast in territory, abundant in resources, and populous. People envy us, and we take pride in this, clearly indicating that our innate endowment has never been lacking. However, in agriculture, crops are abandoned due to low prices, or people migrate due to unrest. The yield of essential food crops decreases daily. Despite favorable weather, phenomena of [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] are still unavoidable. The crux of the matter lies in more than one aspect and cannot be salvaged by a few agricultural experts alone. In industry, transportation bottlenecks prevent the sourcing of raw materials and the distribution of products. Insufficient power and the inability to establish cost accounting hinder the full capacity of factories, large and small, or even lead to their shutdown. This, too, cannot be remedied by a few technicians alone.</p>
<p>The slogan of electricity conservation is incessantly repeated, yet it mostly focuses on households and factories. The former contributes little, and the latter hinders proper operations, while entertainment venues have not seen vigorous curtailment. Declarations for economizing banquets are lengthy and earnestly worded, yet one substantial banquet could use the resources of two. Moreover, catering businesses are adept at reading people's minds, offering extra dishes under different names to reap actual benefits, while patrons and hosts revel in this self-deception.</p>
<p>Profiteering: Wealthy individuals are not inherently a social ill. The people's sufficiency is the ruler's sufficiency. Seeking prosperity for all is a fundamental principle for governing a nation. However, most who amass fortunes today do so through profiteering or exploitation—in short, by sucking the blood of the healthy to enrich themselves, rather than contributing to the greater good or benefiting the populace to earn legitimate profits. Harming others for personal gain is morally reprehensible, and squandering ill-gotten gains only increases consumption and depletes vitality.</p>
<p>Poverty: Those lacking skills, untrustworthy in word, and disrespectful in deed deserve the hardships of poverty. It is appropriate and not only harmless to society but also serves as a warning. However, those currently in poverty often possess some skills, have not lost their conscience, and sincerely dedicate their energy to serving society, yet they lack the means to support superiors or nourish inferiors, constantly preoccupied with basic necessities, exhausting their vitality.</p>
<p>Droughts and floods are not the primary concern, nor is the lack of expertise the greatest worry. Rather, it is hypocrisy, perfunctory performance, inertia, moral decay, the suppression of conscience, insincerity, inconsistency between words and deeds, the reversal of importance, and the thunder of earthenware. Even murders are carried out covertly, unseen, and silently executed. These are truly the debilities of society. If not treated early with bitter medicine, the illness will become incurable, leading to an irreversible terminal condition.</p>
<p>A sense of right and wrong exists in everyone, and only individuals can make the most appropriate judgments about their own actions. In the quiet of the night, who does not have a trace of conscience lingering in their heart, calling out to assess their merits and demerits? Alas, the waves of desire surge and crash, and without great force, one cannot extricate oneself and will eventually succumb.</p>
<p>The most effective remedy for treating social debilities: amplify the voices of the weak and make grand vows for self-rectification!</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Expresses Profound Condolences on the Encoffining of the Late Minister Zhang; Cremation Ceremony to Be Held According to His Will</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The passing of Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of the Judicial Administration of the National Government, in Shanghai has been met with profound condolences from all sectors upon hearing the news. Ambassador Tani Masayuki, Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Allied Nation stationed in China, upon hearing this news, immediately dispatched Secretary Shimizu of the Embassy to the residence of Minister Chu of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express condolences. Minister Chu promptly conveyed these sentiments to the National Government and the family of the late Minister Zhang. Ambassador Tani also instructed the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy to send wreaths nearby to express condolences. Following the passing of Minister Zhang of the Judicial Administration, Dean Zhang of the Court sent a telegram of condolence. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: To Mrs. Zhang [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] of the Late Minister Zhang: Upon hearing the sad news, I was shocked to learn of the passing of Mr. Yunbo in Shanghai due to illness. In mourning for my old friend, I am overcome with grief. Please take care and conserve your strength. Chu Minyi Zhang [omitted, as it's an unreadable character], bowed, 16th.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of the Judicial Administration, unfortunately passed away on the previous (15th) day. Mr. Zhang's contributions to the nation and society during his lifetime are mourned by both Chinese and foreigners alike. The encoffining ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM today at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. However, as Mr. Zhang had previously advocated for cremation, his family, in accordance with his wishes, has decided to hold the cremation ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery immediately after the encoffining ceremony today.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai personally visited the British Funeral Home yesterday to pay respects to the late Minister Zhang. Additionally, Mr. Li Zanhou's eulogy stated: "Entering the earth to save the masses, I admire his courage; like Confucius becoming Minister of Justice, Heaven did not grant him years."</p>
<p>The Thrift Association Mourns Mr. Zhang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Thrift Association held its 22nd regular broadcast last night. Executive Director and [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] Secretary [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] Feng was originally scheduled to speak on "True Thrift vs. False Thrift." However, due to the sudden passing of the Association's Chairman, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the topic was temporarily changed to report on the progress of the thrift movement. The speech briefly stated: "The passing of our Association's Chairman, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, is deeply mourned by us all. In his lifetime, Mr. Zhang was a good and upright official who was honest, self-disciplined, and dedicated to public service in national politics. As an individual, he was a good citizen who was self-restrained, altruistic, and dedicated to the public good. Summarizing Mr. Zhang's life and work, three characteristics can be highlighted: he upheld the dignity of the judiciary and promoted clean politics; he strictly enforced the prohibition of opium and the burial of poison; and he promoted the thrift movement. Especially the latter; throughout his life, Mr. Zhang was not only a diligent advocate but also a practical practitioner. At a time when national affairs are becoming increasingly difficult and people's hearts are sinking lower and lower, Mr. Zhang's sudden passing is truly a great loss to the nation. From the standpoint of the thrift movement, the loss of this mentor is deeply regrettable and mourned." Finally, Mr. Lu also suggested that, in memory of Mr. Zhang's passing, it is hoped that funds can be raised to establish a proactive educational or social enterprise that benefits the nation and the people, to endure for eternity. All tributes and ceremonies should avoid extravagance as much as possible, to be practical and in line with Mr. Zhang's lifelong dedication to promoting thrift and serving society.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Units Heavily Damage Enemy American Aircraft; Four Shot Down, Three Destroyed</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 14th, a certain unit of the Japanese Air Force received intelligence that a dozen enemy P-67 fighter planes were about to launch an attack towards Central China. They immediately dispatched aircraft, and at 6:30 PM, they attacked the enemy planes northwest of Danzhu before they could land, shooting down four and destroying three. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>The Japanese Occupy the Advantage in Mainland Air Battles</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Frontline Military Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - A certain minister of the Japanese Air Force on the Chinese mainland recently described the general situation of the mainland air battles as follows: In order to complete its important mission, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been constructing numerous base clusters in the Guangxi-Hunan area, which are nearing completion. The Japanese army suddenly launched a preemptive strike, causing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to be greatly embarrassed. They then dismantled the base clusters in the southeast and north, shifting their main force to the area from Kunming to Chongqing. On the one hand, they concealed a strong mobile force in the bases of Guilin, Zhijiang, Danzhu, and Liuzhou, observing the gaps in the Japanese army's front line. From this perspective, the tactics used by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing on the Chinese mainland are almost permanent [omitted, as it's unreadable] operations, even if the materials are used for long-term ebb and flow operations. The Japanese Air Force is using its thunder and spiritual power to conduct rapid operations. The air raids on Zhijiang, Guilin, and Danzhu have achieved significant results, also because the Japanese army knows itself and the enemy and uses spiritual power to make up for its shortcomings. This kind of spiritual power and quality is the only weapon to overwhelm the material power and quantity of the Chongqing side. Although the material quantity of the Chongqing side is considerable, its quality is extremely poor. We believe that we will soon be able to annihilate the entire US Air Force stationed in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Guilin is Tense and People are Panicked</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, responding from both the north and the south, has launched a fierce offensive, causing the situation in Guilin, the capital of Guangxi, to suddenly become tense. Various organizations in the area are panicking. According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 14th, members of the Guilin Industrial Association, acting on instructions from the central government, have formed a wartime service corps to assist in evacuating refugees, moving important industrial machinery, and assisting the Chongqing army in destroying bridges and other important facilities.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Army Uses Poison Gas Warfare</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Former Base in Hunan, 16th (Central News Agency) - In late June, the Chongqing side [omitted, as it's unreadable] the Japanese army with poison gas, covering up the disastrous defeat of the Ninth War Zone. The Chongqing army male used poison gas warfare on June 20th. On June 14th, the Chongqing [omitted, as it's unreadable] Division was surrounded by the Japanese army in [omitted, as it's unreadable] Ling when it used it. The Japanese army was fully prepared for this.</p>
<p>Counterattacking Anren, the Chongqing Army Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the fierce battle began at dawn with the Chongqing army [omitted, as it's unreadable] Anren, due to the skill of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army has become like a rat in a bag. On the 11th and 12th, after a tug-of-war, the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses. At the end of last month, the Chongqing army wanted to take advantage of the Japanese army's capture of You County, Anren, and the old Hengyang southwestern area positions to continue its southward advance. It attempted to recapture Anren in one fell swoop, concentrating its forces in the surrounding areas and launching a counterattack at dawn on the 11th. Under the cover of artillery, it attacked from two directions: Junshan (five kilometers west of Anren) and six kilometers north of the Fen River in the northwest. However, after the Japanese army gave a head-on attack, by the evening of the 12th, the entire two divisions of the Chongqing army were wiped out, and the Japanese army seized a large number of light and heavy machine guns and hand grenades. Currently, the Japanese army is continuing its pursuit of them.</p>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, which is advancing south from the southern mountainous area of the Yuehan Railway, occupied Jinlansi on the 9th, and is sweeping away the defeated remnants of the Chongqing army's Fourth Army and other units everywhere. The 15th Division under the command of Xue Yue of the Ninth War Zone in Xiangxiang stubbornly attempted to retake the area and launched a counterattack. After several days of fighting, the Japanese army launched a fierce counterattack, leaving behind more than two hundred corpses. In this battle, thirty-four prisoners were captured, and a large number of weapons and artillery were seized. The Japanese army only suffered about two deaths or injuries each. Furthermore, the advancing pioneer unit discovered about six hundred soldiers of the Chongqing army's 98th Division near Huangpi, Xiangxiang (ten kilometers west of Hengyang) at noon on the 9th, while they were having lunch, and immediately launched a surprise attack, completely destroying them.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Chongqing Army Defending Hengyang to the Death</p>
<p>Outside Hengyang City, 16th (Central News Agency) - The two divisions of the Chongqing army within Hengyang City are on the verge of collapse under the heavy pressure of the Japanese army. According to the confessions of the Chongqing army prisoners and defectors, the desperate situation of the Chongqing army defending the old Yang to the death and the tragic situation on the eve of its fall are as follows: A, Private, "I am a fifty-year-old veteran, but there are also twelve-year-old boys in the army, with most being seventeen and nineteen years old. We have only been in the army for three months since enlisting in Guangdong, and now we are fighting the Japanese army, which is something we never imagined. On the third day after the Japanese army began its attack, the food supply was exhausted. It is said that there are many granaries in the city, but there was no supply to us, and some of us continued to fight without food for two or three days. It was learned that the commander of the sergeant had fought with the Japanese army once in Changde last autumn. From the beginning of this [omitted, as it's unreadable] war, he lost his will to fight. [omitted, as it's unreadable] Commander Xue Yue's statement that 'the Japanese army has abandoned Changsha and retreated' and guarded Weiyang to the death. Xue Yue still aimed at this point after the Japanese army began its group attack, [omitted, as it's unreadable] the war. The ones we trust most are the solid [omitted, as it's unreadable] fortifications and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Although our fortifications are extremely solid, they are all occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese Air Force bombs us day and night, causing the entire army to suffer from nervous breakdown. Because the American army abandoned the airport and fled, it is meaningless for us to defend Hengyang to the death." B, Non-commissioned Officer, "Recently, Hengyang has a strong American color. The Americans are smugly boasting about air raiding Japan, and the frivolous actions of the American drivers are lamentable to all concerned. In addition, there are cotton cloths, fountain pens, pencils, and other stationery, as well as food and cosmetics from American soldiers in Hengyang, flooding the market. The municipal authorities suddenly issued an evacuation order on the 23rd, when the Japanese army was approaching, [omitted, as it's unreadable] moving supplies, so a large amount of supplies was piled up like a mountain, which has become the target of military looting. Important people and wealthy families have all escaped, and a few citizens of Yulin remained when we entered the streets. Because they saw the troops looting rampant, they are extremely resentful of the [omitted, as it's unreadable] people."</p>
<h3>The Resources of the Hunan Antimony Mine Fall into the Hands of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Frontline Base in Hunan, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Hunan has captured key areas such as Anren and Weiyang. The troops advancing rapidly from the central mountainous area of the Yuehan Line are gradually approaching the vicinity of the Songbai (about fifty kilometers south of Hengyang) Shuikoushan mountainous area. The Chongqing army, which owns about a hundred tons of lead and a lead factory, is in a state of disarray. The vast majority of materials and factory facilities have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. On the 8th, the Japanese army, advancing along the Yuehan Road, discovered a [omitted, as it's unreadable] mine in the northwest area of Shui [omitted, as it's unreadable], and obtained [omitted, as it's unreadable] product. This place is the central hub of Hunan, which is rich in [omitted, as it's unreadable] resources. Therefore, Chongqing's cultivation of resources for the War of Resistance, and even the city of world resources, has gradually been controlled by the Japanese army, which has greatly damaged Chongqing. Even the United States, which looks forward to this kind of important military resource, has also suffered a great blow.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Yap Island, Thirteen Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific: On the 14th, the fighter squadron of the Japanese Air Force on Yap Island shot down eight enemy planes, and the Japanese side suffered no losses. Furthermore, on the 15th, they shot down two enemy planes and destroyed three. In this battle, the Japanese army lost one self-detonating and one unreturned aircraft each.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in the Southwest Pacific, 16th (Central News Agency) - Several enemy large aircraft attacked Buru, east of Ceram Island in the Banda Sea, on the 14th. The Japanese army there engaged in combat, shooting down four enemy planes and destroying one, eventually repelling them. The damage to the Japanese side in this battle was minor.</p>
<h3>American Forces Fiercely Attack Saint-Lô, Launching a Tug-of-War; Enemy Waits and Watches East of the River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: The American First Army launched a large-scale attack on Hill 51 in Saint-Lô this morning, which had already been occupied by American suicide squads last night. The high ground east and northeast of Saint-Lô is particularly important for the American army's actions. The American Fifth and Nineteenth Armored Divisions have joined the new offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: On the eastern half of the Normandy front the day before yesterday, there were only localized battles, while the American forces on the western half continued their attacks with considerable effort. The German forces responded calmly, and the enemy failed. Most of the German forces in the coastal area have expanded southward by several kilometers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Frontline News: American forces continue their fierce attacks under the Cherbourg Fortress in Normandy, but have not achieved any results due to German counterattacks. The British army east of the bridgehead seems to be preparing to launch an offensive and is gathering a large army in the Caen area, but it is not yet clear whether the above offensive will be launched after a new landing east of the Orne River. The American army's losses are increasing daily. For example, the American 29th Infantry Division suffered 3,000 casualties (including 1,000 killed) in the attack on the area from Biéville to Saint-Lô. At the same time, the loss of weapons has also increased sharply. In the past 24 hours, 71 tanks, 20 anti-tank guns, and 5 ammunition [omitted, as it's unreadable] vehicles have been lost. The German parachute troops launched a counterattack, seizing 20 anti-tank guns and 5 ammunition vehicles, and used these weapons to continue the counterattack, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Currently, a tug-of-war is unfolding in the Saint-Lô area. Although the American forces attempted to advance towards Sézilles via the Bayeux-Saint-Lô road, they were defeated by the German forces after suffering damage. The American forces have successfully advanced south of the Saint-Gaudent-d'Écajeul road, aiming for the Amayé-sur-Seulles forest. Fierce battles are also unfolding in Carentan and Périers.</p>
<h3>The Western Wing of the Italian Front, Fighting is Intense; German Forces Adopt Evasive Actions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central [omitted, as it's unreadable] News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces on the Italian front are mobilizing all their forces to continue to pressure the rearguard units of the German forces in the western region. The battle line starts south of Livorno, passes through Poggibonsi, and ends at Anzio. Among them, the American Fifth Army's attack in the San Quirico area is the most stubborn. Poggibonsi once [omitted, as it's unreadable] threatened. The German forces recently withdrew from the city. Furthermore, fierce battles are still taking place in the central Arezzo area and the Castello area in the Tiber River basin. Currently, the British army's offensive in this area has been repelled by the German forces. In addition, the German outpost units between Bracciano and Frosinone in the eastern region have withdrawn from the north bank of the Musone River. The British army has made no progress in the Adriatic coastal area.</p>
<h3>The Turkish People Do Not Want War</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: Turkish member of parliament and famous reporter Satak wrote in the [omitted, as it's unreadable] newspaper, "No country wants war. Therefore, Turkey's non-participation in the war will not result in any losses. Some believe that our country should adopt a more aggressive attitude towards this war, but they do not know what they are doing. War is the last resort of national defense."</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: A German foreign ministry spokesman mentioned today that British and American newspapers said that Britain and the United States have requested that Turkey sever diplomatic relations with Germany and cut off economic ties. They hope that Turkey will participate in the war, but did not mention the Turkish government's response. It was also not confirmed whether Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Andrei Vyshinsky had arrived in Ankara to participate in these negotiations.</p>
<h3>The First Phase of Scrap Metal Collection is Completed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the entire country is working together towards ultimate victory. Especially since the authorities announced the measures for collecting scrap metal this spring, local governments in all provinces and cities have responded enthusiastically. It is learned that the counties of Jiangsu Province and attached purchasing agencies, from the beginning of this year to the end of June, have completed the first phase of scrap metal collection. All collected items have been transferred to relevant parties for collection in the vicinity for convenience. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry has also been consulted for reference. It is heard that the second phase of collection will continue. Currently, plans are being made according to the measures promulgated by the central government and its supplementary measures. Once they are finalized, the collection work will begin.</p>
<h3>The Center of the Eastern Front Moves to Ternopil; German Forces Withdraw from Grodno</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The evasive actions of the German forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front, particularly in the Ternopil and Lutsk areas, have been carried out according to plan. The German forces south of these two areas are under strong pressure from the Soviet army but are still able to hold their positions. Northwest of Ternopil and west of Lutsk, the Soviet army has mobilized large numbers of reinforcements (infantry and tank units) to participate in the battle. The German forces are still able to achieve full defense. The Soviet army concentrated light and heavy artillery, especially countless new mortars, to bombard them heavily, but by evening the momentum had temporarily slowed down. Several key gaps have been sealed by German counterattacks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: military news: After reinforcements, the Soviet army in the Grodno area repeatedly attacked the town from the north and the west bank of the Neman River. After extremely fierce fighting, the German forces, under pressure from the Soviet army, withdrew from the town. All military facilities have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Scientific Weapons</p>
<h3>Radio Detector</h3>
<p>The newest and most intriguing weapon to emerge in this great war is the radio detector. Previously, radio waves were used as mouths and ears. However, scientific advancements have transformed radio waves into substitutes for eyes. At the start of this great war, Britain suffered intense bombings from the German air force, and could only helplessly lament. But after a year, the German air force's bombings suddenly decreased. This was because Britain was entirely covered with a surveillance network. Even when telescopes couldn't see them, and listening devices couldn't hear them, the eyes of radio waves could clearly see the shapes of the German aircraft the moment they left their bases. Thus, British fighter planes would immediately take off, and anti-aircraft artillery crews would immediately take their positions, enabling them to be fully prepared for the battle at their leisure. This made the German bomber squadrons' raids more difficult. The eyes of radio waves, the radio detector, was completed in Britain, which suffered the most from air raids. However, this invention began five years before the war.</p>
<p>The Essence of Radio Waves</p>
<p>What exactly is a radio detector? To answer this question, one must first understand the essence of radio waves. In physics, radio waves are called electromagnetic waves, which are vibration phenomena caused by electrical collisions in space. Although this is a particularly difficult phenomenon to grasp, the light that our eyes can see, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, etc., are all examples of different forms of these electromagnetic waves. However, radio waves and light differ greatly in terms of wavelength. The wavelength of radio waves used in today's wireless communication ranges from several thousand meters to just one meter. Recently, extremely short radio waves of several centimeters have also been invented. However, the wavelength of light that our eyes can see is as short as four or seven ten-thousandths of a millimeter. Therefore, light and radio waves have different properties in many ways. Radio waves can freely penetrate even dense fog.</p>
<p>Moreover, while some things are opaque to light, they are transparent to radio waves. This is why rubber and wood are electrical insulators. However, radio waves and light also have similar properties. Light is reflected when it hits a solid object, and radio waves are also reflected when they hit the earth, water, metal, etc.</p>
<p>Last night, even though the sound of explosions could be heard, and the aircraft couldn't be seen, when a searchlight was shone into the sky, the aircraft's silhouette could be clearly seen. This is because the searchlight's light is reflected off the aircraft's body and projected into our eyes. Now, instead of using the light of a searchlight, let's project the radiance of radio waves. Radio waves will also reveal the aircraft's shadow, but the reflected waves cannot be directly seen by the eyes. However, if one were to look with the eyes of radio waves, it would be clearly visible. A radio detector is made based on the principles of a radio wave searchlight and the eyes of radio waves. The radio wave searchlight is a type of radio transmitter, and the eyes of radio waves are a type of radio receiver.</p>
<p>The Principle of the Detector</p>
<p>Let's explain the principle of the radio detector in slightly more detail. Radio detectors can use ultra-short wave or extremely short wave radio waves. The shorter the wavelength of the radio wave, the more concentrated it is when projected in one direction, and the greater its reflection efficiency for small objects like aircraft. With a radio detector, one cannot "see" enemy aircraft in the same way as with the eyes. Instead, the direction and distance of enemy aircraft are determined using the following method. The radio wave's radiance is emitted from the detector's transmitting antenna into the air in all directions. If an enemy aircraft enters this radiance, the radio waves that hit the aircraft's body are immediately reflected. Then, the detector's receiver immediately senses them. At this time, the transmitter does not emit radio waves continuously, but rather intermittently, with a certain time interval. Therefore, the receiver also receives the same intermittent signal. In addition to the reflected radio waves, the radio waves coming directly from the transmitter are also sensed. The receiver is equipped with an amplifier, and a type of tube is connected to it. This part can be called the retina of the radio wave eyes. The received signal manifests as a diagram-like shape on this retina. The two protrusions in the diagram represent the signal that reaches the receiver directly from the transmitter, and the depression in the middle represents the reflected radio waves from the enemy aircraft. The interval between the two protrusions indicates the time interval between one signal and the next. The middle protrusion indicates the time elapsed between the first signal being reflected by the enemy aircraft and returning.</p>
<p>Currently, the interval between signals is one-thousandth of a second. Assuming the interval between the protrusions on both ends is ten centimeters, and the interval between the left end and the middle protrusion is six centimeters, then the time it takes for the emitted radio waves to be reflected back is six-tenths of one-thousandth of a second, or six ten-thousandths of a second. Radio waves travel 300,000 kilometers in one second. The distance traveled in six ten-thousandths of a second is 180 kilometers. However, this is the round-trip distance, so the one-way distance, from the detector to the enemy aircraft, can be known to be half of that, or 90 kilometers.</p>
<p>Warning Machines and Targeting Machines</p>
<p>There are two types of radio detectors: warning machines and targeting machines. The former are used to detect enemy aircraft approaching from afar, while the latter are used to aim at aircraft that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The United States imported this technology shortly after it was invented in Britain, created an American-style version, and immediately handed it over to the vast radio industry to begin manufacturing radio wave weapons. At the same time, they mobilized ordinary radio enthusiasts to quickly establish a management system. By the start of the Greater East Asia War, they had already been deployed to various bases. According to their reports, when our army aircraft carried out the surprise attack on Hawaii, they had discovered them several tens of minutes in advance. Those deployed in Syonan (Singapore) and Kure Head were captured by our Imperial Army, thus completely exposing their construction to us Japanese.</p>
<p>Technical Preparations Matured</p>
<p>So, what about us in Japan? Currently, the technical preparations have already matured. This is because research on television technology has already been completed. The technology of radio detectors is exactly the same as that of television technology. Now, our country has also manufactured excellent machines that are not inferior to those of the enemy. This is an encouraging thing. The invention of radio detectors has changed the methods of warfare, making past surprise attacks impossible. But currently, countermeasures against these detectors are also being planned. When British aircraft bombed Hamburg, they scattered metal strips, a method intended to confuse the eyes of radio waves. Ultra-high frequency radio waves have linear propagation properties, and the property of not reaching below the horizontal line is utilized, so the method of flying at extremely low altitudes has already become commonplace. Because our aircraft still have metal in their engines and other parts, it is impossible to prevent the radio detector from sensing them.

<h3>Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Cash on Delivery</p>
<p>I would like to continue discussing methods to amend administrative purchases. Regarding the necessity of cash on delivery, let me introduce the talks of people who have personally witnessed exchange conditions:</p>
<p>The price of purchases and the exchanged goods have always been abused by middlemen, or obtained through illegitimate means and not delivered to the farmers. The branch office, aware of this, implemented an immediate exchange method between March and April of this year.</p>
<p>The complexions of the farmers returning home after the merchant only provided goods without preparing cash, and the complexions of the farmers returning home after receiving cash on delivery on the spot, were clearly distinguishable. In the former case, the merchant bought rice at a low price, and when the payment would be made was unknown, so they suspected they were being deceived, and their unease was evident. In the latter case, the selling price was slightly lower than the market price, but they were able to settle it on the spot, so they were very relieved.</p>
<p>Regardless of the security situation, this method should be implemented going forward. The above was heard in Wuxi, and similar things were heard in Suzhou. In Changshu, I personally witnessed many farmers who had not yet received 200 yuan of their 720 yuan rice payment. However, in March and April, after being paid in cash on the spot, the farmers were very happy and said:</p>
<p>"Sir, please specify the quantity to be supplied earlier in the future. Even if it is only five pecks per mu after the harvest, we are willing to provide it."</p>
<p>Also in Changshu, I heard someone say to a farmer who brought rice seeds and white rice:</p>
<p>"Are these just rice seeds? Isn't this just rice to eat? Buying rice seeds and rice to eat won't necessarily improve the cooperative's performance. If you really don't have any, there's nothing we can do. Thank you for your trouble, please take it back! Sell it to us next year."</p>
<p>The farmers left in tears. In rural areas where the New Fourth Army and the Chongqing Army are vying for the farmers' support, adopting the method of cash on delivery, while seemingly simple, requires "extraordinary determination." If the term "pacification work" is not applicable today, then unless the merchant itself has the character of a rice procurement task force, it will be difficult to universally adopt this policy. Moreover, the frontline organizations for rice procurement absolutely need to be elevated and organized to a higher degree from today onwards. The activities of merchants pursuing commercial profits by taking advantage of administrative purchases should be reformed quickly.</p>
<p>Due to their inherent habits, farmers borrow money from rice shops and merchants in the towns when the seedlings are still young. Once the harvest comes, they sell the rice and settle the accounts with both parties. The supply and purchase system adopted after the war is contrary to this system. To make farmers feel at ease with the supply and purchase system, it is essential to implement a cash on delivery system with each merchant taking responsibility for receiving the goods.

<p>The Municipal Food Bureau has decided that the special allocation of rice should be transferred from the Huazhong Rice Allocation Cooperative Warehouse in its original packaging. As such, the quantities often vary. In order to standardize this, each bag is now uniformly set at 200 municipal jin. The rice sacks must be returned in full within five days after the rice is issued. Those who fail to return them on time will have their allocation suspended. At the same time, the rice allocation movement permit must also be returned the day after the rice is issued and must not be delayed, in order to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work - Broadcast Address by Director Li of the Judicial Department</h3>
<p>In order to reduce crime among the people and protect local public security, the Judicial Department of the First Police Bureau of this city has specially established a Crime Prevention Section, dedicated to preventing criminal incidents and protecting the rights and interests of citizens. However, crime prevention work is still in its infancy in China, and citizens do not have a good understanding of this work. Therefore, Director Li Shiyu of the Judicial Department gave a broadcast on the topic of "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work" from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM last night on the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, elaborating in great detail. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<p>Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: The topic of my broadcast today is "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work." I don't think this unfamiliar topic will necessarily arouse everyone's interest, but because crime prevention work is of great importance to maintaining social order and tranquility, protecting people's lives and property, personal freedom, and the promotion of happiness; and because I am now responsible for starting to promote this crime prevention work, there are many areas that require everyone to study, and many areas that require everyone to cooperate. Therefore, I have specifically selected this topic to discuss with you.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is what is called crime prevention: In simple terms, it is to maintain public and social order and prevent the occurrence of criminal incidents. In more detail, it is to prevent people who have not committed crimes from committing illegal acts, and to prevent people who have already committed crimes and been punished or exempted from punishment from committing illegal acts again.</p>
<p>Reduce Losses</p>
<p>Furthermore, why is crime prevention necessary? We all know that crimes are subject to punishment, so it seems unnecessary to talk about whether to prevent them or not. However, the purpose of punishment is to reduce and eliminate crime. If we can cut off the factors that cause crime in advance, or control criminals, so that criminal behavior does not breed and spread, then there is of course no need to punish them. From the perspective of criminal policy, we have already moved from retributive and repressive principles to reformative principles in the 20th century, and no one believes that punishing criminals is anything but a last resort. Moreover, when a person commits a crime, whether it infringes on individual legal interests, social legal interests, or national legal interests, it is always detrimental to the country and society. Even if all criminals can be punished, the country and society have already suffered damage. Adding one criminal reduces one good person, which is also a loss to the country and society. Modern scholars call crime a social pathology. We can say that preventing the infection of this pathology reduces harm to individuals, society, and the nation, so it is necessary to prevent crime.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, China has undergone tremendous social and economic changes. People have fundamentally shattered the empty moral concepts that they once held, but have not followed up with the strict implementation of the rule of law, resulting in everyone pursuing their own interests and disregarding national laws. This irrational development has led to politics not being on the right track. If everyone could know and abide by the law, make abiding by the law a habit, and turn abiding by the law into morality, and refrain from doing anything that would harm national sovereignty and satisfy personal desires, and refrain from any behavior that would sacrifice national interests to seek personal gain, and be determined to do what is reasonable and determined not to do what is unreasonable, and seek reasonable development in everything, then we would certainly not have become so weak and poor.</p>
<p>Reviving Shanghai</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, this place only cares about whether you have money or not. If you have money, you can do anything. Punishment seems to be only for ordinary people. All the "tycoons" and gangsters take pride in not abiding by the law and doing whatever they want, without any regard for the law. It is truly a den of iniquity. When Mayor Chen first took office, he made it his responsibility to purify Shanghai. He also took the pain of the citizens of Shanghai as his own pain. He also urged the citizens of Shanghai to be ashamed and strive to revive the ruined Shanghai and save this fallen Shanghai. After hearing Mayor Chen's proclamation, and seeing with our own eyes the various complex and bizarre phenomena in Shanghai society, we deeply feel that purifying the filthy Shanghai and building a new Greater Shanghai is indeed an extremely urgent historical task, and it is our unavoidable responsibility.</p>
<p>I, in admiration of Mayor Chen's great intentions and mindful of my own responsibility, standing in the position of being in charge of police and judicial affairs, am constantly concerned that the protection of the legal interests of the five million citizens of Shanghai, such as their lives, property, and personal freedom, may not be fully comprehensive. I believe that only by purifying all the evils in society can we talk about construction. This purification work is crime prevention work. Therefore, after the recovery of the concessions, I planned how to promote this work. Recently, after being ordered to go abroad to investigate old policies and returning, I established a Crime Prevention Section in the Judicial Department of this Bureau, dedicated to the planning, research, guidance, organization, promotion, and protection and admonishment of various crime prevention work. I can report this: Crime prevention work is in its infancy in China. In Shanghai, we have launched it with an experimental attitude and with the determination to achieve effective results. Now, let me explain the posture and steps of this work.</p>
<p>Active Training</p>
<p>Based on the principle of "correcting others by first correcting ourselves," we are starting to train these hundreds of judicial police officers. Most of these people used to be the "bao tan" [detectives] that people feared. After receiving the concessions, after a year of training and supervision by me, they have all come to deeply understand righteousness. However, I am not satisfied with this. In the future, we will conduct training in batches and recruit high school or college students for training and supplementation, and then eliminate the redundant and inferior. It is expected that in about a year and a half, we can completely change the quality of the entire Shanghai judicial police officers, and then, with strict organization, continue to train them in their work, so that they can improve in their thinking, knowledge, and ability, know how to love the people, know how to abide by the law, and further guide the people to jointly undertake crime prevention work. What I am worried about now is that their treatment is very meager, and the funds for handling cases are insufficient. It can even be said that there is no way to avoid them from resorting to improper means. I am planning how to make their lives stable and provide them with sufficient funds for handling cases, and then reward those who have made meritorious contributions, so that they do not wrongly accuse or let off criminals. These are administrative issues for us, but it is only when people are well-fed that they know honor and disgrace. We must first let them eat their fill before urging them on. I believe that this is also a basic part of crime prevention work.</p>
<p>We know that "killing without teaching" is wrong. The knowledge of the Chinese people is too low. Not to mention that ordinary people have no legal knowledge, even generally knowledgeable people often do not understand the law very well. They are exploited and defrauded by corrupt officials, and they dare not speak out. Even if they want to file a lawsuit according to the law, they are extorted by unscrupulous lawyers or litigators. This is such a painful thing. I believe that popularizing legal knowledge among the people, so that they know the law and abide by the law, and do not commit illegal acts that infringe on others, and also so that they know the litigation procedures and can seek redress once they have suffered damage. Therefore, our crime prevention work is to use lectures, radio reports, entertainment venues, advertisements, newspapers, magazines, and various publicity mechanisms to instill legal knowledge into the people, and at the same time provide the people with many conveniences in litigation. In the past, people were most afraid of going to the police station. As the saying goes, "The yamen [government office] faces south, if you have a case but no money, don't come." This has made people afraid to report their grievances, and has thus condoned evil, creating the many layers of evil in Chinese society today, especially in Shanghai. We must use various methods to</p>
<p>Thoroughly Prevent Crime</p>
<p>Furthermore, crime prevention work cannot be thoroughly carried out solely by relying on judicial police personnel, nor can it be ideally achieved by a small number of people. Our active promotion of the meaning of crime prevention is aimed at making the majority of people understand the importance of crime prevention work, so that they can work together to achieve effective results. It must be understood that the reason why social evil forces are so rampant is, on the one hand, because bad people mostly have organization and power, while good people have no organization and no power; and on the other hand, because most people lack a sense of national identity and always think that government affairs have nothing to do with them. They are unwilling to cooperate, and even develop antagonistic psychology and behavior. They do not know that they are part of the nation, and that the good or bad of the country and society is closely related to them. This is of course due to the fact that civil servants are unable to care for the people and are unable to improve the welfare of the people, but it is also because some people have developed a selfish mentality and are unwilling to stand up no matter what. We must make our greatest efforts to enlighten the general good people to cooperate with our judicial police officers, and take on this crime prevention work in an organized and planned manner.</p>
<p>China is weak and poor, and Shanghai society is filthy and sinking. Mayor Chen, based on the belief of saving the country by first saving the locality, is determined to purify Shanghai in order to build a new Shanghai. We, in accordance with his intentions, want to be the vanguard of this purification work, launching crime prevention work, starting from Shanghai, and earnestly hope that this work will spread to all parts of the country.</p>
