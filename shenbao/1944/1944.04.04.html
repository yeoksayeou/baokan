<h3 id="c1">兒童節應推進救助苦兒運動 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>年一度的兒童節，今天又到了，這次已是第十三屆兒童節日，回想慈幼協會發起此事的主旨，在於「兒童為國家未來主人翁，亦即文化轉移之中心點。使人人有慈幼思想，人人負慈幼責任，幷可使兒童自知所處之地位。以樹强國强種之基」。理想是多麽遠大，意義是多麽深長。經過了十三年的時期，社會對於慈幼福幼事業的策進，尤其是慈幼　幼團體的努力，不無貢獻。可是　　離理想的目標，尙頗遼遠，需要社會不斷與加倍的努力，更加迫切。</p>
<p>我們在去年兒童節日會提出兩點意見：　上海一地，流浪街頭淪為乞丐的兒童，到處可見。誰無兒女，何忍任共流浪，誰說未來的主人翁，而竟腳躅街頭。對於這一羣無人保護的流浪兒童　，養育的責任，就應中會來負擔，必要時强制收容，不能再讓流浪。　還有一般兒童，原是有父母，有監護人養育的，因爲貧無立錐之地，無力養育，也就是赤貧隱貧之家的兒童，雖不任之流浪，但天天在飢餓中捱生活，更談不到敎育，這種貧苦兒童的數目，一定遠超過於流浪兒童，更應該由社會來幫同養育。同時，我們指出要澈底做到上面兩點，現在上海專辦慈幼福幼的慈善團體，還須擴大範圍。希望社會各界有錢有力者，大家同情這件有積極意義培養民族的重大工作，共同協力，充實慈幼福幼團體的經費，責成担負上述工作。最後期望今年今天，不再見到　頭上有流浪兒童。</p>
<p>今年的今天民經到了，我們試加檢討，這一年中各慈幼福幼團體，以及社會對於救濟流浪兒童的工作，從街頭流浪兒童逐漸減少一點觀察，證明了已尺相當力量。不過。澈底做到我們去年提出的兩項工作，還須積極推動。</p>
<p>現在新聞報發起救助苦兒運動，以紀念本屆兒童節。代替十個慈幼福幼團體總募集經費，最低目標爲一百五十萬元，向社會呼籲。我們認爲發起這一運動，紀念兒童節，非常適切。社會事業，祇有一個目標，　無畛域，原無界限，本報在輿論界地位，自應從旁盡宣揚義務，尤其在同業立塲，更應共同作將伯之呼。基此態度，本報先行捐款一萬元，略盡棉薄。謹請愛護本報的讀者諸君，紛起響應，共同贊助。</p>
<p>最後，値得提出的，社會福利部丁部長，適從南京來滬，看到新聞報發起的救助苦兒運動，認為是最有積極意義的社會福利工作，特由中央社會福利事業經費籌募委員會撥捐十萬元，丁部長個人也捐廉一萬元，以示提倡。這是官民協力推進社會事業的表現</p>
<h3 id="c2">烏克魯爾喪失後英兵戰綫瀕危殆　伊姆法爾反軸心軍陷孤立 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>仰光三日中央社電日軍于奪取伊姆法爾東北方之堅陣烏克魯爾後，哥希馬公路後方即被遮斷，故敵第四軍團主力已喪失通達北方之最大即路，及西倫方面之援軍。三月二十六日，日軍在烏克魯爾方面鹵獲之敵方文書中，已暴露敵方首腦對此次戰率極感狼狽，琴丘陵地帶第十七。第二十爾師團，刻巳完全潰滅，敵首腦復誤認在三月十五日渡過更的宛河大舉突破國境之日軍有力部隊兵力無多，乃于十七日侖令第二十三師團及烏克魯爾方面之第四旅團向琴丘陵及加鮑山地方面移動，結果除喪失烏克魯爾，後方兵站綫亦瀕于危殆。現伊姆法爾方面敵兵力，計有第二十及二十三師團之一部，軍團長直事之獨立兩旅團，僅以此微弱兵力，實難抵抗日軍强力部隊之猛攻，故敵首腦焦慮之餘，現正連日要求蒙特巴頓命令往救援。</p>
<p>里斯本三月中央社電　傳印緬戰綫日軍突破中部國境，進入馬尼布爾侯國後，即着着包圍在阿薩密省東部之反軸心軍最大基地伊姆法爾，同時由北方進入之日軍，於遮斷伊姆法爾至哥希馬之公路後，已進達伊姆法爾北方三十公里之地點。故伊姆法爾盆地之反軸心軍，已陷於孤立。路透社駐新德里訪員，亦曾承認伊姆法爾至哥希馬之公路被遮斷後，英軍所受之影響極大，據稱：伊姆法爾至哥希馬之公路已被日軍遮斷，日軍此次採取之戰術，實為反軸心軍過去亦未預料及，而今後為防止日軍深入（按伊姆法爾至哥希馬之公路長達一百三十六哩）起見，必須利用龐大之兵力，始克有濟。過去數月來，對伊姆法爾防衛之措置，實為應付此次非常事態之行動。又稱：現在防衛伊姆法爾之軍隊，現備有巨量之物資，即使補給路斯絕，亦能支持數週之久，同時更可以飛機遝輸物資。該訪員並就中部印緬國境之戰况談稱：現觀日軍之動向，似欲由南方之梯迭姆，東南方之達姆及東北方之各地進迫伊姆法爾，故最近日軍不斷進擊伊姆法爾至哥希為之公路，並着着向達姆戰綫增援，今後日軍如欲由該方面突人伊姆法爾，必須橫斷恩加丘陵，故伊姆法爾今尙未陷於危殆也。</p>
<h3 id="c3">敵空軍挺身隊　成密林孤軍　聞蓋特少將乃係陣亡 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>仰光三日中央社電　英軍當局發表，北緬英空軍挺身隊隊長聞蓋特少將，因所乘飛機失事而死，然察其確因，乃係陣亡者，該指揮官之死，敵空軍挺身部隊已成為密林中之孤軍，已完全喪失繼續鬥爭之戰意，故其全滅之期已在目前。按聞蓋特為敵陣營中長於游擊戰術之第一人，以慓悍勇猛著名，去年春曾擅自强渡更的宛河，發地上游擊戰並侵入加　附近，結果失敗，故乃以三旅團之大部隊，由空中强行優入，然又遭日軍各隊包圍殲滅，其得意戰術遂與其身盡歿。又自前年春季以來，敵空軍西吉列姆少校，曾於緬甸中部巴朋地區之密林地帶降下　　部隊，實行執拗之蠢動，然於三月十四日該少校及　　　均被逮捕，再加聞蓋特之陣亡，敵企圖擾亂緬甸國內之後方工作，完全消滅矣。</p>
<h3 id="c4">敵機日夜警備　印油田地帶 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>緬甸三日中央社電　來多油田地帶為印度敵軍唯一之油田，戰前產量約為三十萬噸，因油質極佳，並可供飛機使用，故戰前曾積極增產，迪古之精油所，乃由巴馬煤油公司分行之阿薩密煤油公司管理，經營其所產石油，全供航空基地使用，敵方復計劃敷設迪古貝至某地之輸油管，至辛布延為止之輸油管若干里，現已完成，敵方為警備該油田地帶，現正由英美戰鬥機不分日夜擔任防備。</p>
<h3 id="c5">敵機連襲特魯克　墜毀十餘架　渥賽等兩島亦有空襲 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>仰光三日中央社電　敵大型機自二十九日起開始空襲特魯克島，其後仍繼績執拗轟炸，然該方面日軍部隊勇敢奮戰，悉予擊落。緣三月三十一日夜，曾有敵大型機十餘架來襲，日軍當即與之交戰，已將其擊退，日方無損害。一日黃昏曾有敵B24型機十餘架來襲，為日軍擊落四架，日方損害輕微。二日上午復有敵B24型機二十六架來襲，日軍當與交戰，擊落敵機八架，擊毀三架，並重創其他敵機，是役日機一架木飛還。又其後調査判明二十九日敵機來襲時曾使其三架起火。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電，三十一日晨有敵小型機三十七架兩度襲擊馬紹爾羣島之渥賽島，日機邀擊之，擊落其一架，日方毫無損失。又一日晨敵戰鬥機十四架，中型機十架共二十四架，曾來襲波那佩島，結果被日機擊落三架</p>
<h3 id="c6">侵入外蒙　渝軍遭擊退 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>莫斯科三日中央社電　渝軍曾在一九四三年末，自新　省境侵入外蒙。塔斯社至本月二日始就該事宣稱：駐新渝軍，曾於去年末，追擊難民，突破外蒙國境綫，射擊居民。外蒙軍即行反擊，已將渝軍擊退。今後若有同樣事件發生，蘇政府為保障外蒙之女全計，决本一九三六年三月十二日與外蒙共和國訂立之互助條約，予外蒙一切必要之援助云</p>

<p>馬尼刺三日中央社電　菲律賓獨立後，菲總統曾頒令關明菲律賓獨立後之根本敎育方針，規定　凡擔任敎授國語，菲律賓歷史等舉科敎師僅限於菲律賓籍者，　在私立學校之管理者中，菲律賓人應佔半敷，其後菲律賓各學校即遵令辦理。茲據菲律賓宣傳局三日發表稱：總統頃頒令，菲律賓大學於遷移後，關於該校之國語，歷史，論理之講座，將由菲律賓人擔任敎授，並飭令其他各公私立學校嚴守前項之條令，以表揚菲律賓之國家意識及涵養與愛國心，使之成為建設菲律賓之重要根本。</p>

<p>杭州三日中央社電　日駐華艦隊報道部畏松島大佐，於二日在此間出席興亞報國會，假座興亞俱樂部舉行之中國軍民演講大會，發表演說，其要旨如次：</p>
<p>本日得在此間與余所最崇敬之中國先生相見一堂，實覺無上榮幸。杭州之山明水秀，向為余所傾慕，且無論在歷史及文化方面，均與日木有密切關係。我國先輩諸士，向曾數次來此訪問，無不稱讚山水之雄大，及歷史之深遠，故余此次來杭，感動益見加深。余茲乘此機會，就目前戰局，與諸君略作說明。</p>
<p>二期作戰防禦攻勢</p>
<p>太平洋之戰局，益趨熾烈，目下之階段，就日本而言，係在於第二期之生產階段。具體言之，第一期在於獲得資源地帶，第二期乃儘量利用此項資源，發揮日本之戰時生產力。再轉而為第三期决戰階段之總進擊，以期完成擊滅英美之目的，確立大東亞共榮圈之基礎。第一期爲昭和十六年十二月八日，至十七年六月。賴我陸海軍之奮戰力鬥，得舉世界史上空前未有之大戰來。未及半歲已將英美勢力驅出東亞。第二期自敵於所羅門方面，實施反攻起，以迄於今。自第一期作戰以來，一敗塗地之敵國英美，至此亟圖挽回敗戰頹勢，乃寄其最大希望於其生產力，而在太平洋戰綫，蠻行出血戰術。觀於敵方目前之戰况，其主攻方向，乃擬由馬紹爾方面猛撲菲律賓，及由所羅門，俾斯麥方面，經新幾內亞而達菲　，此為目前敵所最傾注主力之處。敵之艦艇飛機及人員方面，均蒙受重大損害，然仍以蠻橫之飛石戰術，企圖突破太平洋。最近曾在特魯克等一部份地區。實施奇襲攻擊。因我航空部隊之奮戰，其機動艦隊，蒙受甚大之損書。如所羅門，拉巴爾方面，其所受之損害，極為重大。敵在此方面，雖連戰連敗，然因其國內情勢之緊迫，及大總統改選對策等關係，卒不惜極大犧牲。如目前拉巴爾實施包圍攻擊，每日展開猛烈之航空戰。査目下第二期作戰，日木之戰略，乃在防禦敵之攻勢，在我國生產力之擴充，未達到戰略上必要限度之前，對於敵之攻擊，當以帝國獨特之邀擊戰術，予以最大損害，茲已日漸達到目的。</p>
<p>以逸待勞</p>
<p>又散處於太平洋之無數島嶼，就我方而言，乃可利用以遲延敵之前進，漸以擊破敵之兵力。此項島嶼可分爲戰略上應予絕對確保者，擬予保持者種。目前敵所一時占領者，就我方而言，决非致侖要地。據美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資稱，彼等之最終目的，乃企圖由菲島至中國以之為根據地，而與日本作最後之決戰。今日由南洋方面敵艦隊之行動，可視爲係其前奏，然觀於以往敵之進擊途徑，係在我外防禦綫之範團，因此方面之距離，及補給較便，敵亦比較容易接近。然今後敵所窺伺者，當為我方之內防禦錢，可無疑義。余所最尊敬之中國古來兵家孫子，所謂「以逸待勞」，實爲作戰之要締。敵在南太平洋廣漠海面，實施突破作戰，其目的乃在搜索我方之主力艦隊。失敗，蓋支配一國運侖運之艦隊，其决戰必選取自己所要之時期及塲所為要締。並不因敵之挑戰，而經舉行動。美艦隊空費多量燃料。結果仍屬徒勞，而我海軍則發揮數十年之傳統精神，安如磐石，靜待尅制敵方妄動時期之到來。其間所受之若干損害，在戰略方面誠係萬不得已之犧牲。為獲得他日之大成功起見，自須暫時忍耐，在如此時期，敵方宣傳之橫行，自須相當警戒。</p>
<p>敵機實力逐漸消滅</p>
<p>其次北太平洋方面敵之反攻，由阿留申之基斯加，及阿茲島為基地以吾國之北千島及樺太為目標，至今雖仍未出偵察機活動之範圍。然自四月以降，因氣候之恢復，敵將自該方面出擊，自須警成。其他為印度洋孟加拉灣方面敵之出擊，此方面蒙特巴頓雖數度自誇戰績，然仍未有若何進展。此面作戰而言，我駐華艦隊與陸軍部隊，取得緊密聯絡，仍對渝方及其背後之英美勢力，繼續作戰。爲　掃除太平洋之戰雲，以從速安定大陸起見，中國之完全和平統一，實最為必要。目前作戰上應行注意者，為駐渝美空軍之無秩序盲炸，因吾陸軍機之奮戰，已將其實力逐漸消滅。然對於防空上，自當十分注意，以策萬全。此項駐渝美空軍之行動，據尼米資稱，係欲與中國大陸作戰行動，合而為一，其陰謀顯欲將中國化為戰塲，毫無可疑。</p>
<p>英美目的蹂躪東亞</p>
<p>彼等侵入中國企，圖與日本作最後决戰，此就中國立塲而言，誠麗遺憾之至，彼等圖將中國之土地人口，在其犧牲之下，以與日本作戰，此適與中國之命運背道而馳，必使中國化為焦土而已。此觀於今日義大利之情勢，即可瞭然。我日本之戰略，在此項重大局面之下，乃係與中國緊密連繫，共同協力，驅除英美勢力。日本自實現新政策以來，迭經實施交還租界，撤廢治外法權，並返還敵　等。而英美所求於中國者，則在奪取中國之兵，強使作戰。大東亞戰爭之目的，觀於大東亞共同宣言所聲明，乃在使大東亞歸還本來面目，與英美之為求一己利益，而蹂躙東亞，有天壤之別。自古以來正義之軍必獲勝利，已成千古定律，然為求勝利起見，必以克服一切困難為先决問題。坐待勝利，自來决無此理。目下緬印國境，因日軍之勇戰猛擊，形勢業經一變。吾人今後為貫澈最終目的起見，自當越益堅持作戰决心，以突破今後難局，而獲得最後之勝利而後已。</p>

<p>柏林三日中央社電　據海通社訊：黑海沿岸廣大無樹之原野，其無數村縱均係德名，可知前為德國農民殖民之區，現正發生猛烈戰事。蘇軍約有步兵十師及坦，克車二團企圖擾亂德軍之避離行動，該區有自北而南之河流數條所分劃，地形頗為奇特，在無通海之蒂里古爾河現正發生劇戰。敵軍企圖渡河，被防守之德軍反攻，損失甚重。據昨夜消息，德軍之防禦戰已獲得或功，在聶斯特河與普魯斯河之間，德羅軍曾殲蘇騎兵一團及包圍蘇步軍一師，俘獲千人。泰諾波爾之東南已發生巷戰，有歷史性之美麗建築物已夷為發墟。蘇軍現亦猛攻柯維爾，有大隊空軍助戰，德取抵抗甚烈，普萊士高附近雖有惡戰，但僅為牽製行動耳。</p>

<p>日政府以「精進一年」為目標，决定了「决戰非常措置要綱」，時至今日，國民非發揮一切的戰力不可。一萬萬國民在政府的大號令之下，將實現未曾有的堅固决意，那麽措置要綱，如何表現在我們的生活上呢？茲探究决戰進擊路綫吧：</p>
<p>學徒動員</p>
<p>此次的學徒動員態勢之澈底，係將一月十八日在閣議决定的「緊急學徒勤勞動員方策要綱」更加強化的。因戰局的深刻，對於學徒之緊急任務，確立一萬無失的準備，而將整飭常時不斷，有事即應的組</p>
<p>從來一年當中，有四個月的勤勞動員，此後改為一年當中，得以常時勤勞及擔任其他緊急任務。向來稱學徒動員，乃以學校報國隊之組織對象中學校三年敎以上爲主要目標，此後包含中等學校一年級以上及國民學校高等科之兒意，參加動員組織之內。而這組織態勢，中等學校經上者，活用現在的學校報國隊，對於國民學校之高等科，新編組織。這些組織之整飭與强化，因學校為單位，故以敎戰員為中心擔任，各學校之敎育力，在動員組織中，發揚力量。</p>
<p>勤勞動員之中，理科系統，即理，工，農，醫之各大學，高專及工業學校等的學徒，為使其勤勞效率，發揮到最高度，各適應其專門智識，大部份佈置於軍關係的管理工廠，協力工廠，或病院等。關於這種動勞的堪合，特別致意其學科的性質上，尤其注重實地的現塲敎育，例如醫科的學生，使其從事軍病院的實務等，講究特別的動員方法。</p>
<p>勤勞動員更進一步，即有必要時，將學校校舍，成為軍需工廠化，學生即在這裏能够動勞，採取如此措施。這種之設施，乃由軍需工廠任之，但其對象之學校主要是女學校及工業關係的學校，尤其是女學校除了特殊地域以外，全部成為被服工廠化，並且利用雨天時用的操塲，營設被服工廠，在裁縫的時問或下班後，少女們即在此工廠做做　衣。</p>
<p>而且對於這動勞動員，為「國民動勞體制之刷新」的一環，企圖迅速刷新及强化體制前决定之「緊急學徒勤勞動員方策要綱」內有：「文部省或地方當局推荐之敎職員或關係官吏，使其兼任軍需監理官或勞務管理官，同時在有關工廠，設置學徒專門之勤務辦事員，為文部省或地方當局的囑託，擔任管理在工廠，及工作塲之學徒勤勞。」立刻實施這種方法。在工廠或工作塲，養成敎育的情緒，以期貫澈勤芝即是敎育的精神。此外學校的關係者即。學校校舍有必要時，作為軍用緊急倉庫用（因爲學校之分布狀況，極有計畫的，所以雨天操塲等使用作非常食糧及復興材料等的倉庫）或作爲緊急病　，避難住宅（如受空襲發生遭害時，預先配置。）或轉作其他緊急的用途。</p>
<p>國民勤勞</p>
<p>一萬萬國民無分男女老幼，無分階層，擧全力貢獻軍需生產與確保食糧，此為决戰非常措置要綱中之「國民動勞體制之刷新」的目標。因爲如此，政府以如下兩點爲主要着限點，將迅速地實現具體的方</p>
<p>使軍動員與勤勞動員緊密化，以期綜合調整國民的動員。</p>
<p>强化此後作為新勤勞之根幹的學徒及女子動員體制達嚴高度。因是强制使女子加入挺身隊，或使勤勞力量有餘裕者，澈底講究活用的方策。</p>
<p>現在以飛機為中心的軍需生產增强，大部份徵用勞務人員以補充，但由軍動員與農業要員的確保見地，明年度如不果把學徒，女子等與一般靑壯年一樣激底動員，則軍需生產目標，不能達成，所以採取這次的緊急措置。目下在具體的考慮的，於「國民勤勞體制之刷新」中有。</p>
<p>（甲）為使從事不急職業者，動員到緊要部門，實施轉換職業。</p>
<p>（乙）即應適材適所主義，對於緊要部門的產業從事人，實行轉換工作塲的佈置。</p>
<p>（丙）爲急速實行女子及學徒等的工廠勤努必要之引受體制，除整飭工廠設施宿舍等之外，全面的迅速地刷新女子之待條件等勤勞管理。</p>
<p>（丁）活用家庭勞務的方途有：不能到工廠工作而有餘閑從事軍需生產之家庭婦人，即在街會各保甲統合去勤務奉仕。有必要時，在各保甲創設輕易之工作塲。</p>
<p>食糧配給</p>
<p>簡素生活澈底的覺悟與食糧配給的改善整備，有着關　的性質，兩方面同時實行，才有效果。農商省以縱使生鮮食糧配給機構整備，但生產旣有一定限度，不難有充分的物資可以立刻配給。因此覺悟生活澈底的簡素化，旣受公正的配給，便要以此為滿意克服困難。對於大都市的食糧配給機構，賦與公共性，以期其運營萬無一失。然而尙無綜合的配給所，先把靑果與魚類之配給分開，近將產生共同配給所。內田農商大臣的理想。更其飛躍，强化保甲會之運營，在保甲會內設置物件交換處，將現在形式上平等的配給品，隨其各家庭之必要與否，使其交換，目下正在硏　這種體制。對於都會的少年等之措施者：全國十大都市之國民學校兒童約二百萬，由學校供給午膳，利用鄕土食而勵行混食。並制定增加分量的煮烹法。芋頭類的乾燥，剷除多量的水分，以便輸運與貯蓋。監魚即切離頭部，將食用部份監醃起來，以便輸運和貯藏。（弘譯自二月二十七日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>低物價政策之實踐，絕不是一件簡單容易的事，其成功實有賴於多方面的努力。雖然在多方面中，或許有輕重緩急之分，可是，我們總覺在實施低物價政策之下，倘然偏重其一方面而偏廢其他方面，那末，低物價政策上的所能收獲的效果，恐怕仍然是不能合於理想的。</p>
<p>自其最基本的條件而言，低物價政策之實踐，須以物資交流正當化為目標，這是當前舉國上下的一致公認的，而最近中央備備銀行取締聯鈔黑市，並指定十一家銀行辦理華北匯兌，藉資促進華中華北間物資與資金之交流，尤足指示這一個基本條件的已在履行中了。</p>
<p>同時，我們認為低物價政策之實踐，有賴於其他方面的努力者，則為：　積極推進各項生產，　嚴格執行公定價格，　盡量强化配給機構，　澈底倡導節約運動，　實行獎勵人民儲蓄。總之，上述種　條件的綜合履行，方足以保證低物價政策的成功與戰時人民生活的安定。如今，這些條件的履行，似已逐步開始了，因為禁　制囤而外，新的經濟警察機構復將於最近期間成立。今後低物價政策的進展，也許會有驚人成績，正未可知。</p>

<p>兒童節特輯之一</p>
<p>引言　今天是第十三屆兒童節，同業新聞報，發起救助苦兒運動，以資紀念，意義良深，此運動的目的，是代替本市十個　幼福幼團體總募集經贊，最低目標為一百五十萬元，深盼社會各界熱烈贊助。本報為盡官揚義務，特派員參觀十慈幼團體，記其梗槪，編為特輯介紹，以籍幅所限，分日揭載。其中在去年本報　已有介紹者，茲併複刋之，以期社會人士對之更有深刻認識，幸讀者垂　，幸甚。</p>
<h3 id="c50">流浪兒童的樂園　凈業孤兒院參觀記 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>凈業孤兒院創立不過四年所收的孤兒，現在一共是八十餘人，年齡由十二歲至十八歲，四分之三由前工部局兒竄保障科所保送，這些兒童，大多數是犯過罪，受過感化的童犯，他們多數是工廠和商店裏的學徒，因為受不了鞭打的痛苦而逃出，但又不敢回家，右的因幼失怙恃，無人撫飬，他們一遭到了流浪以後便為歹徒所勾引，而幹那偷竊掠奪的勾當。</p>
<p>生活　律化</p>
<p>生活方面採取工讀制，早晨六時半起身，七時早操，以後是吃早粥和掃除，八時三刻到十一時半是上課時間，十二時午飯，下午一時到五時半是工作時問，六時晚粥，七時至八時有一次集會。他們之間，組織了一個生活委員會，會內分文化，膳食，康樂，寢室，糾察，衛生，整潔，儲蓄等入組，為了管理上的方便起見，全體院生分成九小隊，每小隊有小隊長二人，又舉總隊長一人，凡生活上的一切，從買小菜燒飯，洗衣，以至於進餐，睡眠，整潔秩序等，都　他們自己來處理，先生祇處在轉導的地位。</p>
<p>用勞力換飯吃</p>
<p>「學習技能，用自己的勞力換飯吃」，這是他們生產工作中的信條，院中本有的工塲是皮鞋。藤工。竹工。成衣。西服。網袋。養兔等七工塲，現在為了原料的關係，大部份在停頓中，成衣和結網兩工場，仍在繼續工作，在成衣工塲襄，二十幾個兒童在縫製着由外面拿來的衣服，他們的手藝，着實不輸於成人們，看他們縫的縫，燙的燙，裁的裁，顯得很純熟的樣子，但年齡都不過在十二三歲之間，結網工作比較簡易，兒童們的頭腦是靈活的，而手足更敏捷，在編結時很是迅速，至於所得的工資，充作院方的經費，但也每月根據他們工作的勤惰和件數，來計算他們應得的獎金。所得獎金，不能直接化費，必須存入儲蓄組，他祇執有一張存摺，必需時可以憑摺向合作社取物。</p>
<p>進步特別快</p>
<p>他們有着過人的知力，所以對於任何方面，進步都很迅速，有的在道院時根本不認識字，但經過了短短的敎育時間，便能比較優秀而聰明的，就呌他們向助學金機關考取助學金，轉入程度較高的學校，有四個孤兒，本來曾獲申報助學金，但本學期已考取了　　獎學金，其中三個是初中一，上學期的學業成績，三個人得到了全級的前第三名，一個初中二，也得到全級的三名，可見他們　　的過人了。</p>
<p>對於敎導方面，是注重積極的鼓勵，而忌消極的懲罰。</p>
<p>至於他們的經費，完全由外界捐助，現在每月的支出，在七八萬元左右，由於物價的繼長增高，經費的支出也跟着加多，「敎義院是一頂橋梁，把孩子們從黑暗的一頭，帶到光明的一頭」，這有意義的工作，希望以社會的力量來援助它改善，發展！</p>
<h3 id="c51">女靑年會創辦的　職業婦女托兒所 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>女靑年會職業婦女托兒所是設立在威海衛路上的，塲址並不大，推門推去是一個竹籃圈好的小　，院中沒有滑梯等兒童辦戲用的器具。走進辦公室，有該所主持人陳善明女士陪同參觀各處。七八十位兒童，並依年齡劃分，兩歲到四歲編入托兒所。四歲到六歲編入幼稚園，並按情形分為兩班，一是住所的，一是日間托兒的，後者兒童在所時間自上午八時半至下午五時半，除午餐外，還供給兩頓點心，住所兒童則另加上早晚兩餐，有家長經濟困難的，可要求撤減費生，其實交全費的，也僅够維持該兒的食住。其他保育費，教育費，雜費等等，都要靠女靑年會方面津貼的</p>
<p>所中有教員一人（師範畢業）助教二人，保姆九人（初中程度，經過特別訓練的），至於經濟的支配：一日約需三千，一月約需九萬，旦因物價飛漲不已，很難作精確預算的。再按所中收費的情形看來，全日生每月收四百元；用午膳則另加三百五十元。寄宿生每月收一千三百五十元，這已是最低的生活費了。</p>
<p>參觀各處</p>
<p>旋由陳女士陪同上樓參觀，先到「兒童盥洗室」，只見木架上一排排都是綠色的小臉盆，都用白手巾蓋着，盆邊編好號數。次參觀寢室，這裹都是單人睡的矮木床，床上一律舖着潔白的被單，衣物箱籠都安置得很妥貼，架上用布簾遮好，內放兒童自備的水果雞蛋等。櫥中放着日常醫藥用品，門後掛着一隻隻編號的小布袋，這是留給兒童各自放置零星雜物的。譬如一些紙片，一塊木頭，一方石子，都是孩子們心目中的實貝。再到「課室」中去參觀，只是有二十幾位兒童由一位教帥領專着，正在唱着跳着，預備明天的兒童節遊藝表演呢！他們小手拍着，小嘴唱着，看着實在可愛得很。</p>
<p>另外又看了「病房」幾個兒童正害着病，假使是有傳染性的，就要送進「隔敵室」。托兒所請有一位醫生，每星期來檢查健康一次，有病時再另時請。幾位保姆也都具備着聲華常識，很能注意保護兒童健康的。</p>
<p>再問到他們最需要的帮助，金錢當然是急需的，其次，兒童的玩具，國書，藥品，也很需要，說得合理想一些，最好能租得一所寬大些的房屋，希望各界熱心公益人士，能切米為兒童造福，能救助一般屬於「隱貧」的職業婦女，推進社會服務事工才好！</p>
<h3 id="c52">佛敎保嬰院巡禮 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>當我走進那門口掛着「佛教保嬰院」的石庫門時，就看見五六個三四歲的小孩，在那客堂里呆呆地坐着或站着，穿的是淡靑的衣服，並擊着白　涎，有的還茁壯，不過大半的面孔都很蒼黃缺乏血色，由於肌肉的瘦削，更顯得他們的腦袋是很大了。</p>
<p>嬰兒的寢室有兩間，淡綠色的小鐵床上面都舖着潔白的被褥，陽光射進來，一排排的顯着非當有秩序，還有兩個正在床上睡着，他們是一歲也沒到，還要每天吃奶。隔離室這是專為生病的嬰兒而設的，也有好些鐵床，有幾個嬰孩正住在裹面，他們生的多半是由營養不良，而起的一些病症。</p>
<p>這里有三十個額子，規定大概是收十個有父母而實無力負擔其生活的孩子。二十個收棄嬰或無父母的孩子，前者都是介紹來的，後者多數是由警察署兒童保障科轉來的。</p>
<p>身體茁壯或面貌端正的孩子在這里是不大住得長遠的，這是因為時常右無子女的人到道里來選擇一個家去撫養的綠故，在正式出院時，這手續也還得通過保障科來辦理，以資愼重。</p>
<p>富於佛敎色彩</p>
<p>孩子多數是無姓名的所以一律姓慈度，這是帶佛敎色彩的，也算是一種紀念而已。</p>
<p>關於日常生活這里很注意和關心兒童的營養，他們早上一頓粥，中午一頓麵，晚上是一餐飯，別的什末也沒有了。就是道樣在極經濟的塲合力求有人生必需生活素而已。至於教育除遊戲外他們也有識字，記數等簡單輕易的功踝。</p>
<p>議嬰士有三位，他們都是以全部精力供獻給嬰兒的，從天明到夜晚從黃昏到黎明，輪流着休息和工作，他們的待遇根本談不到，就是食吧，因為孩子需要營養是比大人更迫切，所以他們的食是較兒童差的多了。然而他們辦事仍舊很認眞和努力，道的確是值得稱揚的。</p>
<p>該院沒有固定經費，全是靠各界的捐款來維持的，現在每月語三萬左右的支出，他們是多末渴望着和需要着各界的捐款和協助啊！</p>

<p>The annual Children's Day has arrived again today. This is the 13th Children's Day. Recalling the main purpose of the Children's Welfare Association in initiating this event, it lies in "children being the future masters of the country, that is, the center of cultural transfer. To make everyone have the idea of caring for children, everyone should be responsible for caring for children, and children should be able to know their position. To build the foundation for a strong country and a strong race." How grand the ideal is, and how profound the meaning is. After a period of thirteen years, society's promotion of the cause of child welfare, especially the efforts of child welfare groups, has made contributions. However, it is still quite far from the ideal goal, requiring continuous and redoubled efforts from society, which is even more urgent.</p>
<p>We raised two points last year on Children's Day: In Shanghai alone, children wandering the streets and becoming beggars are everywhere. Who has no children? How can they bear to let them wander? Who says they are the future masters, but they are wandering the streets? The responsibility for raising this group of unprotected wandering children should be borne by the association, and compulsory shelter should be provided when necessary to prevent them from wandering again. There are also some children who originally have parents and guardians to raise them, but because they are too poor to stand on their own feet and are unable to raise them, that is, children from extremely poor or hidden poor families. Although they are not allowed to wander, they live in hunger every day, let alone receive education. The number of such poor children must far exceed that of wandering children, and society should help them raise them together. At the same time, we pointed out that to thoroughly achieve the above two points, the charitable organizations in Shanghai that specialize in child welfare need to expand their scope. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who have money and power will sympathize with this major work of cultivating the nation with positive significance, and work together to enrich the funds of child welfare organizations, and be responsible for undertaking the above-mentioned work. Finally, it is hoped that this year, today, wandering children will no longer be seen on the streets.</p>
<p>Today this year has arrived, and we will try to review it. During this year, the work of various child welfare organizations and society in rescuing wandering children has gradually decreased the number of wandering children on the streets, proving that considerable efforts have been made. However, to thoroughly achieve the two tasks we proposed last year, we must actively promote them.</p>
<p>Now the News is launching a movement to help suffering children to commemorate this Children's Day, raising funds for ten child welfare organizations in total, with a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan, and appealing to society. We believe that launching this movement to commemorate Children's Day is very appropriate. Social undertakings have only one goal, without boundaries or limits. This newspaper, in its position in the field of public opinion, should fulfill its obligation to promote it, especially from the standpoint of the same industry, and should jointly call for action. Based on this attitude, this newspaper will first donate 10,000 yuan to do its best. We respectfully request the readers who love this newspaper to respond enthusiastically and support it together.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that Ding, Minister of Social Welfare, happened to come to Shanghai from Nanjing and saw the News' movement to help suffering children. He believed that it was the most positive and meaningful social welfare work, and specially allocated 100,000 yuan from the Central Social Welfare Fund Raising Committee, and Minister Ding himself also donated 10,000 yuan to show his advocacy. This is a manifestation of the cooperation between officials and the people to promote social undertakings.</p>
<h3 id="e2">After Losing Ukhrul, British Troops' Battle Line is on the Verge of Collapse; Imphal's Anti-Axis Forces Fall into Isolation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army seized Ukhrul, a stronghold northeast of Imphal, the rear of the Kohima Highway was cut off. Therefore, the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army Group has lost the largest road to the north and reinforcements from the Sylhet area. On March 26, the enemy's documents captured by the Japanese army in the Ukhrul area revealed that the enemy's leaders were extremely embarrassed by the battle. The 17th and 20th divisions in the Chin Hills area have completely collapsed. The enemy's leaders mistakenly believed that the strong Japanese forces that crossed the Chindwin River in a large-scale breakthrough of the border on March 15 were not numerous. Therefore, on the 17th, they ordered the 23rd Division and the 4th Brigade in the Ukhrul area to move to the Chin Hills and Kabaw Valley areas. As a result, in addition to losing Ukhrul, the rear supply line is also on the verge of collapse. Currently, the enemy forces in the Imphal area include a part of the 20th and 23rd Divisions, and two independent brigades directly under the commander of the army group. With only this weak force, it is difficult to resist the fierce attacks of the strong Japanese forces. Therefore, the enemy's leaders are anxious and are now requesting Mountbatten to order reinforcements day after day.</p>
<p>Lisbon, March 3rd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that after the Japanese army on the India-Burma front broke through the central border and entered the Manipur Kingdom, they immediately began to encircle Imphal, the largest base of the anti-Axis forces in eastern Assam Province. At the same time, the Japanese army entering from the north cut off the highway from Imphal to Kohima and advanced to a point 30 kilometers north of Imphal. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces in the Imphal Basin have fallen into isolation. A Reuters correspondent stationed in New Delhi also admitted that the impact on the British army was extremely great after the highway from Imphal to Kohima was cut off. It is said that the highway from Imphal to Kohima has been cut off by the Japanese army. The tactics adopted by the Japanese army this time were not expected by the anti-Axis forces in the past. In the future, in order to prevent the Japanese army from advancing further (the highway from Imphal to Kohima is 136 miles long), it is necessary to use a large amount of troops to be effective. In the past few months, the measures taken to defend Imphal were actions to cope with this emergency. It is also said that the troops defending Imphal now have a large amount of supplies, and they can last for several weeks even if the supply route is cut off. At the same time, supplies can be transported by air. The correspondent also talked about the war situation on the central India-Burma border, saying that the current trend of the Japanese army seems to be to approach Imphal from Tiddim in the south, Tamu in the southeast, and various places in the northeast. Therefore, the Japanese army has been constantly attacking the highway from Imphal to Kohima recently, and is increasing reinforcements to the Tamu front. In the future, if the Japanese army wants to break into Imphal from this area, it must cross the Nga Hills. Therefore, Imphal is not yet in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Enemy's Airborne Troops Become Isolated Troops in the Dense Forest; It is Heard that Major General Wingate Died in Battle <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The British military authorities announced that Major General Wingate, the commander of the British airborne troops in northern Burma, died in a plane crash. However, the reason for his death is actually that he died in battle. The death of the commander has made the enemy's airborne troops isolated troops in the dense forest, and they have completely lost the will to continue fighting. Therefore, the date of their annihilation is imminent. Wingate was the first person in the enemy's camp who was good at guerrilla tactics. He was famous for his bravery and fierceness. Last spring, he forcibly crossed the Chindwin River without authorization and launched a ground guerrilla war and invaded the area near Katha. As a result, he failed. Therefore, he forcibly entered by air with a large force of three brigades, but was surrounded and annihilated by various Japanese troops. His triumphant tactics ended with his death. Since the spring of the previous year, enemy Air Force Major Seiglum has dropped troops in the dense forest area of Papun in central Burma and carried out stubborn harassment. However, on March 14, the major and his troops were arrested. In addition to Wingate's death in battle, the enemy's attempt to disturb the rear work in Burma has been completely eliminated.</p>

<p>Burma, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Ledo oil field area is the only oil field for the Indian enemy army. Before the war, the output was about 300,000 tons. Because the oil quality is excellent and can be used for airplanes, production was actively increased before the war. The Digboi oil refinery is managed by the Assam Oil Company, a branch of the Burma Oil Company. The oil produced is entirely for aviation bases. The enemy also plans to lay an oil pipeline from Digboi to a certain place. The oil pipeline to Shingbwiyang, which is several miles long, has now been completed. In order to guard the oil field area, the enemy is now guarded by British and American fighter planes day and night.</p>

<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Colonel Matsushima of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet in China attended the China-Japan Military-Civilian Speech Conference held by the Greater Asia Patriotic Association at the Greater Asia Club here on the 2nd and delivered a speech. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Today, I feel extremely honored to meet with the Chinese gentlemen whom I most admire here. The beautiful scenery of Hangzhou has always been admired by me, and it has close relations with Japan in terms of both history and culture. Many of our predecessors have visited here several times and praised the magnificence of the mountains and rivers and the depth of history. Therefore, my impression is even deeper this time I come to Hangzhou. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the current war situation to you.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Defensive Offensive Warfare</p>
<p>The war situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. The current stage, as far as Japan is concerned, is in the second phase of production. Specifically, the first phase is to obtain resource areas, and the second phase is to make the most of these resources and exert Japan's wartime productivity. Then it will turn to the third phase, the total offensive of the decisive battle phase, in order to complete the purpose of destroying Britain and the United States and establish the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The first phase was from December 8, Showa 16 to June 17. Relying on the efforts of our army and navy, we won a great war unprecedented in world history. In less than half a year, we drove the British and American forces out of East Asia. The second phase has been from the enemy's counterattack in the Solomon Islands to the present. Since the first phase of the war, the defeated enemy countries of Britain and the United States have tried to reverse the trend of defeat and placed their greatest hope on their productivity. On the Pacific front, they have carried out barbaric bloodletting tactics. Looking at the current war situation of the enemy, their main attack direction is to attack the Philippines fiercely from the Marshall Islands, and to reach the Philippines from the Solomon Islands and Bismarck, via New Guinea. This is where the enemy is currently focusing the most. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in terms of ships, aircraft, and personnel, but they still use the barbaric flying stone tactics to try to break through the Pacific. Recently, they have carried out surprise attacks in some areas such as Truk. Due to the efforts of our air force, their mobile fleet has suffered great losses. In areas such as the Solomon Islands and Rabaul, the losses they have suffered are extremely heavy. Although the enemy has been defeated repeatedly in this area, due to the urgency of their domestic situation and the countermeasures for the presidential election, they do not hesitate to make great sacrifices. For example, the current Rabaul is carrying out a siege attack, and fierce air battles are being launched every day. Looking at the current second phase of the war, Japan's strategy is to defend against the enemy's offensive. Before the expansion of our country's productivity reaches the strategically necessary limit, we should use the unique tactics of our empire to inflict the greatest damage on the enemy's attacks. This has gradually achieved its purpose.</p>
<p>Waiting for Work with Ease</p>
<p>The countless islands scattered in the Pacific, as far as we are concerned, can be used to delay the enemy's advance and gradually defeat the enemy's forces. These islands can be divided into those that should be absolutely secured strategically and those that are intended to be maintained. Currently, those temporarily occupied by the enemy are by no means important places as far as we are concerned. According to Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, their ultimate goal is to attempt to use the Philippines to China as a base for the final battle with Japan. Today, the actions of the enemy fleet in the South Seas can be regarded as a prelude to this. However, looking at the enemy's previous invasion routes, they are within the scope of our outer defense line. Therefore, the distance and supply are more convenient in this area, and the enemy is relatively easy to approach. However, what the enemy is coveting in the future should be our inner defense line, there is no doubt. Sun Tzu, the most respected ancient Chinese military strategist, said that "waiting for work with ease" is the key to combat. The enemy is carrying out a breakthrough operation in the vast sea of the South Pacific. The purpose is to search for our main fleet. Failure, because the fleet that dominates a country's fortune must choose its own time and place for the decisive battle. It does not act because of the enemy's challenge. The US fleet wasted a lot of fuel. As a result, it was still in vain, and our navy exerted the traditional spirit of decades, as stable as a rock, waiting for the time to restrain the enemy's recklessness. Some of the damages suffered during this period are strategically unavoidable sacrifices. In order to achieve great success in the future, we must temporarily endure. During such a period, we must be quite vigilant against the rampant propaganda of the enemy.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Strength is Gradually Eliminated</p>
<p>Secondly, the enemy's counterattack in the North Pacific, with the Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu Islands as bases, targets our country's North Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. Although they have not yet moved out of the scope of reconnaissance aircraft activities. However, since April, due to the recovery of the climate, the enemy will attack from this area and must be vigilant. The other is the enemy's attack in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. Although Mountbatten has repeatedly boasted of his achievements in this area, there has still been no progress. In terms of this operation, our fleet in China and the army have maintained close contact and continue to fight against Chongqing and the British and American forces behind it. In order to eliminate the war clouds in the Pacific and stabilize the mainland as soon as possible, the complete peace and unification of China is most necessary. What should be paid attention to in the current operation is the disorderly and blind bombing of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Due to the efforts of our army aircraft, its strength has been gradually eliminated. However, we must pay close attention to air defense to ensure complete safety. According to Nimitz, the actions of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing are intended to combine with the combat operations on the Chinese mainland. There is no doubt that their conspiracy is to turn China into a battlefield.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Britain and the United States is to Trample East Asia</p>
<p>They invaded China and attempted to have a final battle with Japan. This is a matter of great regret as far as China is concerned. They plan to use the land and population of China as sacrifices to fight against Japan. This is contrary to the fate of China and will only turn China into scorched earth. This can be seen from the current situation in Italy. Japan's strategy under this major situation is to closely link with China, cooperate jointly, and drive out the British and American forces. Since the implementation of the new policy, Japan has repeatedly implemented the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the return of the enemy's funds. What Britain and the United States seek from China is to seize China's troops and force them to fight. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, is to restore the original appearance of Greater East Asia, which is vastly different from the purpose of Britain and the United States to trample East Asia for their own interests. Since ancient times, the army of justice must win, which has become an eternal law. However, in order to win, we must overcome all difficulties first. There has never been a reason to sit and wait for victory. At present, the situation on the Burma-India border has changed due to the brave and fierce attacks of the Japanese army. In the future, in order to achieve the ultimate goal, we must strengthen our determination to fight to break through the current difficult situation and achieve the final victory.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Huitong News Agency, fierce battles are currently taking place on the vast, treeless plains along the Black Sea coast. The numerous villages there have German names, indicating that the area was formerly colonized by German farmers. Approximately ten divisions of Soviet infantry and two tank regiments are attempting to disrupt the German evacuation efforts. The area is divided by several rivers running from north to south, creating a unique topography. Intense fighting is currently occurring on the Tiligul River, which does not have access to the sea. The enemy is attempting to cross the river, but is being counter-attacked by the defending German forces, suffering heavy losses. According to last night's news, the German defensive battles have achieved some success. Between the Dniester and Prut Rivers, German and Romanian forces annihilated a Soviet cavalry regiment and encircled a Soviet infantry division, capturing thousands. Street fighting has broken out in the southeast of Ternopil, and historically beautiful buildings have been reduced to ruins. The Soviet forces are also fiercely attacking Kovel, with large air force support. German resistance is very strong. Although fierce battles are taking place near Prieskold, they are merely diversionary actions.</p>
<p>The Battle for Odessa Attracts Attention</p>
<p>Zurich, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: In the southern sector of the Eastern Front, intense offensive and defensive battles are unfolding near Odessa in Bessarabia, and in the region from Bukovina to Kovel. German counterattacks have been significantly intensified in recent days, except in the Odessa area. A German High Command communiqué also stated that German forces had launched offensives in the areas southwest of Stanislaviv and Proskurov, achieving significant results. According to a Berlin correspondent for a German newspaper on the 2nd, the situation on the southern sector of the Eastern Front proves that the German counterattack capabilities have increased. Field Marshal Manstein is currently commanding the entire army to defend the Dniester River, the Prut River, and the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. Only the right flank of Manstein's army is continuing to retreat. It is expected that German forces in that area can also establish a strong defensive line in front of Odessa. Since last month, the Soviet forces under General Zhukov have been completely stopped in the area from Ternopil to Stanislaviv. Another unit, aiming for Chernivtsi and the Tatar Pass in the Carpathian Mountains, does not seem to have made any progress either. The Soviet forces under General Konev, with Yasi as their target, have advanced from the east bank of the Prut River to the area of the Herja River, a tributary of the Prut River, but have since been severely defeated by German and Romanian forces. The ongoing battle for Odessa is attracting considerable attention. The Soviet forces under General Malinovsky, in order to cut off the retreat route of the German forces under Manstein's right flank, are slowly advancing towards Odessa from the east and north, and are further advancing towards Tyraspol, northwest of Odessa, in order to cut off the Odessa-Chisinau railway and threaten the rear of the Odessa defense forces.</p>

<p>Zurich, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Berlin correspondent of the Swiss newspaper, the German military authorities have announced the following noteworthy points regarding the German military operations on the southern sector of the Eastern Front: Taking into account the future situation in Western Europe, Germany is allowing the situation on the Eastern Front to develop further. The German High Command has not transferred large armies from other fronts to the Eastern Front, and Germany's war preparations at home have not yet begun. The German forces are maintaining the initiative on the Eastern Front. The German forces on the Eastern Front can still be expected to launch large-scale operations. It is a mistake to assume that the German retreat is due to weakened forces. The German High Command is currently planning to build a defensive line in the most appropriate location. The current intense battle in Ukraine is not enough to determine the outcome of the war. The Eastern Front currently has only secondary importance.</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Decisive Battle: The Path of Aggression in Life <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>With the goal of "Intensified Year," the Japanese government has decided on the "Essential Points for Emergency Measures for the Decisive Battle." Now, the people must exert all their war power. Under the government's great order, one hundred million citizens will realize an unprecedented firm determination. So, how are the emergency measures reflected in our lives? Let's explore the path of aggression in the decisive battle:</p>
<p>Student Mobilization</p>
<p>The thoroughness of this student mobilization is a strengthening of the "Essential Guidelines for Emergency Student Labor Mobilization" decided in the Cabinet meeting on January 18. Due to the depth of the war situation, the emergency tasks of students have been established with foolproof preparations, and the organization will be constantly rectified and respond to emergencies.</p>
<p>In the past, there were four months of labor mobilization per year. From now on, it will be changed to constant labor and other emergency tasks throughout the year. The so-called student mobilization mainly targeted students in the third year or above of middle school in the school Patriotic Corps organization. From now on, it will include students in the first year or above of secondary schools and the children in the higher grades of national schools, who will participate in the mobilization organization. Regarding the organizational posture, those who have gone through secondary school will use the current school Patriotic Corps, and for the higher grades of national schools, a new organization will be formed. The rectification and strengthening of these organizations will be carried out by the teaching staff as the center, with the school as the unit, and the educational power of each school will be exerted in the mobilization organization.</p>
<p>In the labor mobilization, students in the science system, that is, the universities, colleges, and industrial schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, will be deployed to military-related management factories, cooperative factories, or hospitals, etc., to maximize their labor efficiency, adapt to their specialized knowledge. Regarding this type of labor deployment, special attention will be paid to the nature of their subjects, and special emphasis will be placed on on-site education. For example, medical students will engage in practical work in military hospitals, and special mobilization methods will be studied.</p>
<p>Further advancing labor mobilization, when necessary, school buildings will be turned into military-related factories, and students will be able to work there, taking such measures. This type of facility will be entrusted to the military-related factories, but the target schools are mainly girls' schools and industrial-related schools. In particular, girls' schools, except for special areas, will all be turned into clothing factories, and the training grounds used in rainy weather will be used to build clothing factories. During sewing time or after work, girls will work in these factories making clothes.</p>
<p>Moreover, for this labor mobilization, as part of the "Refreshing the National Labor System," in order to quickly refresh and strengthen the system, the "Essential Guidelines for Emergency Student Labor Mobilization" decided earlier state: "Teachers or related officials recommended by the Ministry of Education or local authorities will concurrently serve as military supervisory officers or labor management officers. At the same time, student-specialized service staff will be set up in relevant factories, commissioned by the Ministry of Education or local authorities, to manage student labor in factories and workplaces." This method will be implemented immediately. Foster an educational mood in the factory or workplace, in order to thoroughly implement the spirit that diligence is education. In addition, school-related personnel, that is, school buildings, will be used as emergency military warehouses when necessary (because the distribution of schools is very planned, so rainy-day training grounds, etc., will be used as warehouses for emergency food and reconstruction materials) or as emergency hospitals, evacuation residences (in case of damage from air raids, they will be pre-configured), or converted to other emergency uses.</p>
<p>National Labor</p>
<p>One hundred million citizens, regardless of gender, age, or social class, will contribute all their strength to military production and securing food. This is the goal of "Refreshing the National Labor System" in the emergency measures for the decisive battle. Therefore, the government will focus on the following two points to quickly realize concrete plans:</p>
<p>Make military mobilization and labor mobilization closer, in order to comprehensively coordinate national mobilization.</p>
<p>Strengthen the student and female mobilization system, which will be the foundation of new labor from now on, to a strict level. Therefore, women will be forcibly made to join the Volunteer Corps, or those with surplus labor power will thoroughly study ways to utilize them.</p>
<p>Currently, military production is being increased, focusing on aircraft, and most of the labor personnel are requisitioned to supplement it. However, from the perspective of securing military mobilization and agricultural personnel, if students, women, etc., are not mobilized as thoroughly as ordinary young adults next year, the military production goals cannot be achieved. Therefore, these emergency measures are being taken. What is currently being considered concretely in "Refreshing the National Labor System" includes:</p>
<p>(A) In order to mobilize those engaged in non-urgent occupations to urgent departments, implement occupational conversion.</p>
<p>(B) That is, according to the principle of adapting talent to the job, implement the arrangement of changing workplaces for those engaged in industries in urgent departments.</p>
<p>(C) In order to quickly implement the necessary acceptance system for factory labor for women and students, in addition to renovating factory facilities, dormitories, etc., comprehensively and rapidly refresh the conditions of treatment for women, etc., labor management.</p>
<p>(D) Ways to utilize family labor include: Housewives who cannot go to factories to work but have spare time to engage in military production will be integrated into the street association's various baojia for service. When necessary, create simple workplaces in each baojia.</p>
<p>Food Rationing</p>
<p>The thorough determination of a simple life and the improvement and maintenance of food rationing have a related nature. They are only effective when implemented simultaneously. Although the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is improving the fresh food rationing mechanism, production has a certain limit, and it is not easy to have sufficient materials to immediately ration. Therefore, be aware of the thorough simplification of life. If you receive a fair ration, you must overcome difficulties with this as satisfaction. The food rationing organization in large cities will be given public character, so that its operation is foolproof. However, there is no comprehensive rationing center yet. First, separate the rationing of green fruits and fish, and a joint rationing center will be established soon. This is the ideal of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Uchida. Furthermore, strengthen the operation of the baojia council. Set up an object exchange office within the baojia council to exchange the equally rationed items, depending on the needs of each family. This system is currently being studied. As for measures for urban youth, about two million children in national schools in the ten largest cities across the country will be provided with lunch by the school, using local foods and encouraging mixed eating. In addition, establish cooking methods to increase the amount. Dry the taro, remove a large amount of water, so that it can be transported and stored. Cut off the heads of sentinel fish, pickle the edible parts, so that they can be transported and stored. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun on February 27)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Various Parties Enthusiastically Sponsor the Aircraft Donation Campaign <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign, the Municipal Government has issued orders to assist it, and the Baojia coupons and the commemorative coupons of the trade associations have been promoted in turn. The work of the Association has spared no effort and has won enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life. In order to support this campaign, this newspaper voluntarily donated 10,000 National Currency. Mr. Chen Binghe, President, has always been patriotic and donated 5,000 yuan. He has sent a letter to the Association for forwarding to the National Government, to fulfill his duty and to advocate for voluntary donations from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read your brief commentary on April 3, "Contribution to the Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee," which showed your insightful and caring views. I am deeply grateful. Our Association is handling the Aircraft Donation Campaign this time. We dream that people from all walks of life in the community will assist us first, and enthusiastic people will assist us later. Donate, originally winged to support national policy, to participate in the war with all our strength, in order to awaken the patriotic thought of the people and complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. We dare not take a drop of public money, and everything is public, and everything is announced, in order to live up to the expectations of the enthusiastic people in the community. For example, donations from the calligraphy and painting charity exhibition and the charity football match were announced in the China Daily on February 9 of this year. Similarly, the Jingju charity performance was initially donated by Mr. Zhang Shankun for 3 million to 5 million yuan, but the performance has not yet been completed, and the money has not been handed over. The concert is undertaken by the National Music Academy, and the procedures are being expedited. Once it is over, it will be announced. Other coupons such as Baojia coupons and trade association coupons are being distributed and solicited. In short, each item will be announced one by one after it is over to show great faith and live up to the enthusiastic intentions of all parties. Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee Qi, April 3.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Shanghai District Opium Smoking Centers Will Be Banned by the End of June; All Will Be Closed Upon Expiration <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Interior promulgated the regulations on banning Tu Gao business firms, the registration of married people, and the phased abstinence methods, and the deadline for banning smoking centers, the Shanghai District, which has sale-smoking centers for people to smoke opium, is limited to be banned before June 30 this year. If there are still private establishments after the deadline, they should be transferred to the judicial authorities for punishment. As for Tu Gao merchants, they are not allowed to set up private establishments without obtaining a special permit and certificate approved in accordance with the regulations, and they shall stop business altogether when the three-year prohibition period expires.</p>
<p>The Authorities Plan to Set Up Opium Hospitals</p>
<p>Since the campaign to ban smoking and gambling has been fully launched, opium will also be strictly banned, ordering residents who smoke to quit as soon as possible. However, those who are deeply addicted often do not know how to quit, and private hospitals generally charge high fees. In view of this, the authorities will set up opium hospitals in the near future, and three pilot hospitals will be set up in Nanshi, each with a capacity of about 100 people. The internal equipment is very scientific, and the Changju has specially hired Dr. Zuo Yuan, a member of the Beijing Asia Medical Research Institute, to come to Shanghai to provide guidance. It is expected that the opium atmosphere in this city will be completely eliminated within the year.</p>

<p>After the Chinese North China Journalist Corps and the Women's Inspection Corps arrived in Shanghai, at 9:30 AM yesterday (3rd), the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Women's Association sent staff to guide them to visit the Municipal Women's Association. Immediately afterwards, they went to the Municipal Government to pay their respects to Mayor Chen, who was received by Secretary-General Wu on his behalf. After briefly touring the Zhao Feng Chemical Garden, they drove to Datong Road to attend a joint banquet hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Women's Association.

<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee reorganized the existing office structures in Xia Shi and other places in order to make the institution sound and prevent smuggling.

<p>The Xinzha District Baojia Committee suddenly issued a notice to the city yesterday, informing that the Baojia regular fees will be collected soon, and stipulates that stores will pay 12 yuan per month, regular households will pay 8 yuan, and attached households will pay 4 yuan. After receiving the notice, residents of the district all believed that since the implementation of the Baojia system, the authorities have never explicitly stipulated the collection of any fees, and the Baojia Association has already received the regular operating expenses from the Baojia Office, but they can arbitrarily collect Baojia fees again, and even if Baojia fees are collected, the Baojia authorities should explicitly stipulate it. In addition to the Xinzha District, other districts have the same situation, but the number of collections varies. Some are calculated by person, and some are collected by household. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the Baojia authorities will find a way to stop it in order to stop unscrupulous Baojia personnel from taking advantage of the situation and engaging in fraud.</p>

Helping impoverished children is one of the most positive aspects of social welfare work, and it should arouse joint donations from all sectors of society. In order to support this, I am allocating 100,000 yuan from the Central Social Welfare Enterprise Funding Committee, which will be retroactively approved when the committee meets in the future. At the same time, I am also donating 10,000 yuan to promote this cause.

<h3 id="e43">The Implementation of a Low-Price Policy <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The implementation of a low-price policy is by no means a simple and easy task. Its success relies on efforts from many aspects. Although these aspects may have varying degrees of importance and urgency, we always feel that if, in the implementation of a low-price policy, one aspect is overemphasized while others are neglected, then the effects that can be achieved in the low-price policy are likely to fall short of ideal.</p>
<p>From its most basic condition, the implementation of a low-price policy must aim to normalize the exchange of materials. This is a universally recognized fact throughout the country. Recently, the Central Reserve Bank has taken measures to crack down on the black market for joint banknotes and has designated eleven banks to handle remittances to North China, in order to promote the exchange of materials and funds between Central China and North China, further indicating that this basic condition is already being implemented.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that the implementation of a low-price policy depends on efforts in other aspects, such as: Actively promoting various productions; Strictly enforcing official prices; Maximizing the strengthening of the rationing mechanism; Thoroughly advocating the conservation movement; Implementing incentives for people's savings. In short, the comprehensive implementation of the above conditions is sufficient to guarantee the success of the low-price policy and the stability of the people's lives during wartime. Now, the implementation of these conditions seems to have gradually begun, because in addition to banning hoarding, a new economic police agency will soon be established. The progress of the low-price policy in the future may yield surprising results, which is not yet known.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Banking and Money Industries Prepare Reserves, Restricting Interbank Lending, Those Exceeding the Limit Will Be Rejected <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in order to crack down on speculation and hoarding and curb rising prices, has strictly restricted the loan business of financial institutions. It is understood that the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee and the Banking and Money Industry Reserve, in order to ensure that chip funds should be treated with special care after the Central Reserve Bank tightened lending, so as to avoid temporary adjustment difficulties, has specially notified all banks and money shops that those exceeding the limit for interbank lending will be rejected, in order to store more head money for the necessary adjustments of the same industry and general special adjustments.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Issuance of Payment for Yarn and Cloth Purchases: Central Reserve Bank Stipulates Dates <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to issue special fixed deposit certificates for the purchase of yarn and cloth with interest and one-sixth of the principal amount in national currency, starting from the first day of this month, those who have withdrawn money have been unusually crowded. In order to avoid crowding, the bank has specially stipulated the daily payable certificate numbers. It is hoped that the holders of special fixed deposit certificates for yarn and cloth will go to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank on the Bund to withdraw money according to the certificate. The stipulated payment certificate number dates are: April 4, No. 0001 to No. 300, 5th from No. 301 to No. 600, 6th from No. 601 to No. 900, 7th from No. 901 to No. 1200, 8th then No. 1201 to No. 1500, 11th from No. 1501 to No. 1800 12th from No. 1801 to No. 2100, 13th from No. 2101 to No. 2400, 14th from No. 2401 to No. 2700, 15th from No. 2701 to No. 3000, 17th from No. 3001 to No. 3300, 18th from No. 3301 to No. 3600.</p>

<p>The National Government, in order to organize the old legal currency and stabilize finance, issued 150,000 yuan in "Financial Stabilization Public Bonds" on June 1, 1932. According to regulations, interest is paid twice a year, and only interest is paid within ten years. From the eleventh year, the principal will be drawn by lottery every six months. It is heard that the fourth interest payment will be paid by the Central Reserve Bank starting from May 31 this year. The interest will be allocated from the special accounting item and transferred to the financial stabilization public bond fund account by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the principal and interest payment schedule of the public bond for payment and maintenance of national debt credit. The Ministry will announce the payment method to the public at the time.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of paper supply and the high cost of printing, this newspaper has been deeply loved by society during this extraordinary period, and the sales volume has increased. While the colleagues of this newspaper deeply appreciate the kindness of readers and strive to make it convenient for readers to continue reading, and at the same time, due to limited resources, they try their best to save and avoid the slightest waste, from now on, the distribution affairs have to be appropriately adjusted. The registration form is attached first. We hope that all readers cut it out, fill it out immediately, and send it directly to the distribution section of this newspaper at No. 309 Hankou Road before the 5th of this month so that we can engage in sorting out permanent plans. We also hope that readers will cooperate, so that both parties will benefit greatly. Sincerely, Shen Bao Newspaper</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>1.  If you do not want to cut the original newspaper for preservation, you can fill out and send it on another piece of paper in the same format.</p>
<p>2.  This form has already been published in yesterday's newspaper. If you have already filled it out, you do not need to fill it out again.</p>

<p>Children's Day Special Issue One</p>
<p>Introduction: Today is the 13th Children's Day. The Xinwen Bao newspaper has initiated the "Save Impoverished Children" campaign to commemorate it, which is of great significance. The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for ten children's welfare organizations in the city, with a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will enthusiastically support it. In order to fulfill its public service duties, this newspaper has sent special correspondents to visit ten charitable organizations, record their outlines, and compile them into special reports for introduction. Due to space limitations, they will be published on different days. Those that have already been introduced in this newspaper last year are also being republished in order to give the public a deeper understanding of them. We hope that readers will pay attention to them.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Paradise of Street Children: A Visit to the Jingye Orphanage <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Jingye Orphanage was established only four years ago, and the number of orphans it has taken in is now more than 80, ranging in age from 12 to 18. Three-quarters of them were sent by the former Public Concession Children's Security Section. Most of these children have committed crimes and have been reformed. Most of them are apprentices from factories and shops. Because they couldn't bear the pain of whipping, they escaped, but they didn't dare to go home. Some of them lost their parents when they were young and were not cared for. After they became vagrants, they were seduced by thugs and engaged in stealing and looting.</p>
<p>Life is Regimented</p>
<p>Life is based on a work-study system. They get up at 6:30 in the morning, do morning exercises at 7:00, and then have breakfast and clean up. From 8:30 to 11:30, it is class time. Lunch is at 12:00. From 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM, it is work time. Dinner is at 6:00 PM. From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, there is a meeting. Among them, a life committee is organized. The committee is divided into cultural, food, recreation, dormitory, discipline, health, sanitation, and savings groups. For the sake of management convenience, all the orphans are divided into nine small teams. Each small team has two team leaders, and there is one general team leader. All aspects of life, from buying vegetables and cooking, washing clothes, to eating, sleeping, sanitation, order, etc., are handled by themselves, and the teacher is only in the position of guidance.</p>
<p>Earning Food with Labor</p>
<p>"Learning skills and earning food with one's own labor" is their creed in production work. The orphanage originally had seven workshops for leather shoes, rattan work, bamboo work, clothing, suits, mesh bags, and rabbit farming. Now, due to the relationship of raw materials, most of them are suspended. The clothing and netting workshops are still working. In the clothing workshop, more than 20 children are sewing clothes brought in from outside. Their craftsmanship is really not inferior to that of adults. They sew, iron, and cut, and they look very skilled, but their ages are all between 12 and 13 years old. Netting is relatively simple. Children's minds are flexible, and their hands and feet are more agile. They are very quick when knitting. As for the wages they earn, they are used as the orphanage's expenses, but they are also calculated each month according to their work ethic and the number of pieces, to calculate their deserved bonuses. The bonus cannot be directly spent, it must be deposited into the savings group. They only hold a passbook, and can take items from the cooperative with the passbook when necessary.</p>
<p>Progress is Particularly Fast</p>
<p>They have extraordinary intelligence, so they progress very quickly in any aspect. Some of them didn't even know how to read when they were in the Taoist temple, but after a short period of education, they were able to be more excellent and intelligent. They were asked to apply for scholarships from scholarship organizations and transfer to higher-level schools. Four orphans originally received Xinwen Bao scholarships, but this semester they have been admitted to the ______ scholarships. Three of them are in the first year of junior high school, and their academic performance in the last semester was in the top three of the entire grade. One is in the second year of junior high school, and also got the third place in the entire grade, which shows how extraordinary they are.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching, emphasis is placed on positive encouragement, and negative punishment is avoided.</p>
<p>As for their expenses, they are entirely donated by the outside world. The current monthly expenditure is around 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Due to the continued increase in prices, the expenditure of funds has also increased. "The educational institution is a bridge, taking children from the dark side to the bright side." This meaningful work hopes to be helped and developed by the power of society!</p>
<h3 id="e51">A Nursery School for Working Women Founded by the Young Women's Christian Association <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The YWCA Nursery School for Working Women is located on Weihaiwei Road. The site is not large. Pushing open the door, there is a small yard surrounded by a bamboo basket. There are no slides or other children's play equipment in the yard. Walking into the office, Ms. Chen Shanming, the person in charge of the center, accompanied us on a tour of the various places. Seventy or eighty children are divided according to age, with those aged two to four enrolled in the nursery school, and those aged four to six enrolled in the kindergarten. They are divided into two classes according to the situation, one for residents and one for day care. The latter children stay at the center from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM, and in addition to lunch, they are also provided with two snacks. Resident children are provided with two additional meals, breakfast and dinner. If the parents have financial difficulties, they can request a reduction in fees. In fact, paying the full fee is only enough to maintain the child's food and accommodation. Other childcare fees, education fees, miscellaneous fees, etc., all have to be subsidized by the YWCA.</p>
<p>There is one teacher in the center (a normal school graduate), two teaching assistants, and nine nannies (junior high school education, specially trained). As for the economic distribution: it costs about 3,000 yuan a day, and about 90,000 yuan a month, but because prices are soaring, it is difficult to make an accurate budget. Looking at the tuition fees in the center, full-day students pay 400 yuan per month; lunch costs an additional 350 yuan. Boarding students pay 1,350 yuan per month, which is already the lowest cost of living.</p>
<p>Touring the Various Places</p>
<p>Then, Ms. Chen accompanied us upstairs to visit. First, we went to the "Children's Washroom," where we saw rows of green small basins on wooden racks, all covered with white towels, with numbers assigned to the side of each basin. Next, we visited the bedroom, where there were low wooden beds for each person to sleep on, all covered with clean white sheets. The clothing boxes and baskets were all arranged neatly, and the shelves were covered with cloth curtains, which contained the fruits and eggs that the children brought with them. The cabinets contained daily medical supplies, and behind the door hung small numbered cloth bags, which were left for the children to place their miscellaneous items. For example, some pieces of paper, a piece of wood, and a stone were all treasures in the children's minds. We then went to visit the "Classroom," where there were only twenty or so children led by a teacher, singing and dancing in preparation for tomorrow's Children's Day show! They were clapping their little hands and singing with their little mouths, and they looked so lovely.</p>
<p>We also looked at the "Sick Room," where several children were sick. If it was contagious, they would be sent to the "Isolation Room." The nursery has a doctor who comes to check their health once a week, and will ask for another one in times of sickness. Several of the nannies also have sound health knowledge and are very able to protect the health of the children.</p>
<p>When asked what they need most, money is of course urgently needed. Secondly, children's toys, books, and medicines are also very much needed. Speaking more ideally, it would be best to rent a larger house, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about public welfare can sincerely create well-being for children, help the "hidden poor" working women, and promote social service work!</p>
<h3 id="e52">Buddhist Infant Asylum Tour <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>As I walked into the "Buddhist Infant Asylum," through the stone-framed gate, I saw five or six children, aged three or four, sitting or standing blankly in the reception room, wearing light blue clothes, drooling with saliva. Some were robust, but most had pale and sallow faces, lacking color. Due to the thinness of their muscles, their heads appeared disproportionately large.</p>
<p>There were two infant bedrooms, with small light green iron beds, all covered with clean white bedding. Sunlight streamed in, showing rows arranged in an orderly fashion. There were also two sleeping in bed, not yet a year old, and still needing to be fed milk daily. The isolation room was specially designed for sick infants, and there were several iron beds there as well. Several infants were staying inside, mostly suffering from illnesses caused by malnutrition.</p>
<p>The facility has thirty cribs and is intended to accommodate roughly ten children with parents who are genuinely unable to support their lives, and twenty abandoned or orphaned children. The former are referred, while the latter are mostly transferred from the Children's Protection Section of the police station.</p>
<p>Children who are physically robust or have good features do not stay here for long. This is because people without children often come here to choose one to raise. Upon formal discharge, the procedures must also be handled through the Protection Section to ensure caution.</p>
<p>Rich in Buddhist characteristics</p>
<p>Most of the children do not have surnames, so they are all named "Ci Du," (Compassionate Crossing) which carries Buddhist connotations and serves as a memorial.</p>
<p>Regarding daily life, great attention and concern are given to the children's nutrition. They have porridge in the morning, noodles at noon, and rice in the evening, with nothing else. Even so, they strive to provide the necessities of life in the most economical way possible. As for education, in addition to playing, they also have simple and easy lessons in literacy, counting, and other basic skills.</p>
<p>There are three nurses dedicated to the infants, and they devote all their energy to caring for the children. From dawn to dusk, from twilight to dawn, they take turns resting and working. Their compensation is not even worth mentioning, even in terms of food, because the children's need for nutrition is more urgent than that of adults, so their food is much worse than that of the children. However, they still work very conscientiously and diligently, which is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>The asylum has no fixed funding and relies entirely on donations from all sectors of society to maintain operations. Currently, the monthly expenditure is around thirty thousand, and they are desperately hoping for and needing donations and assistance from all sectors of society!</p>
