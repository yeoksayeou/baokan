<p>社評</p>
<h3>玉碎精神</h3>
<p>日本大本營昨日發表，守備庫埃茲林島及魯奧特島之帝國陸海軍部隊，約四千五百名，以及協力守備之軍屬二千名，自一月三十日以來，與敵美展開激戰，予敵以重大損失後，於二月六日作最後之突擊，全體兵貫壯烈殉國。我們聽到這一悲壯消息，除對盟邦殉國將士表示崇敬悼意外，特別感覺盟邦將士視死如歸的傳統精神，實爲任何敵人所無法威脅，不可輕　的偉大力量。同時，這種精神，就是擊滅敵人爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利的保證。</p>
<p>去年五月阿茲島之役，十二月馬金島等之役，盟邦守備部隊，均會以「以一當十」的奮勇精神，與十百倍的來襲敵人相搏鬥，使敵人支付最大代價以後，抗禦敵人至最後一彈之後，才作壯烈殉國，與此次庫埃茲林島，魯奧特島之役，同樣是日軍發揮忠勇精神的最有力的說明。更可以從而親察日本軍隊，自將官以至士兵，每一個軍人都具備爲國效命的志願，不但絕無畏葸退縮的弱點，而益發堅強同仇敵愾心理。這又是擊滅敵人爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利的保證。</p>
<p>這次戰役，日本軍隊及軍屬雖然犧牲了六千餘人。可是，敵美所犧牲者，僅就常職推測，勢必遠在日軍人數之上，因爲日軍在準備犧牲之前，必定全身是膽是勇，非至殲滅敵人至最後一分力時不止。而敵軍方面，則冒險行軍，虛怯畏縮，可想而知，在這樣對照之下，敵軍完全從人數上壓制日軍，則損失數量之　人，可以槪見。其次，美國人民中應徵兵役者已達十三分之一，而且盡十六個後方人民之力，才能供養兵士一個。因此人口感到不足，勞動人口又減少三百萬，於是動員墨西哥及南美的農民到美國從事勞動。但在日本方面，人民中應徵兵役的僅及二十五分之一，所以，日本人口對於軍源之補充，綽有餘裕。從軍隊的動員數量上以觀，盟邦日本較之敵美更不可同日而語。這也是大東亞戰爭爭取最後勝利的保證。</p>
<p>中國有一句古諺說：「寗為玉碎，不為瓦全」。現在盟邦日木的軍隊，就個個抱具此種精神，個個堅定此種信念。可是，反顧我們中國，雖則古人已有寗玉碎不瓦全的壯烈胸懷，然而到現在，如果我們事臨嚴重關頭，是不是有古人所昭示我們的遺風呢？這是成為疑問的。我們睜眼以觀，現社會的姿態，是充滿着投機取巧，騎蘠模稜的氣氛，只知小我的私利，不顧大衆的公益，更邊論犧牲精神了。投機取巧的現象愈深刻化，國民道德就愈趨　落，而公利觀愈淡薄，犧牲精神就愈堙沒。目前物價高漲，囤積投機猖獗等等現象，都從國展道德墜落中產生。我們在參戰時期，而社會姿態若斯，反觀盟邦日本國民，敵愾情緒之緊張，一致奮力參戰，相形之下，實不勝其愧作。</p>
<h3>庫埃茲林等兩島日守軍壯烈犧牲　對來襲敵軍曾予莫大損害</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中法社電　日大本營二十五日下午四時發表：守備庫埃茲林島及魯奧特島之帝國陸。海軍部隊約四千五百名，自一月三十日以來，即於來襲之敵大開動部隊熾烈之轟炸下，與敵展開激戰，我軍勇猛奮鬥，　擊敵軍，予敵以莫大損害後，於二月六日，作最後之突擊。全員乃行壯烈戰死，魯奧特島守備隊指揮官，為海軍少將山田道行，庫埃茲林島守備隊指揮官為海軍少將秋山門造。又該兩島之軍屬約二千名，曾協力守備隊奮戰，全員亦與守備隊共其命運。</p>
<h3>日島田海相披瀝完成聖戰之決意與陸軍協務爭最後勝利</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日島田海相二十五日於日大本營發表守後，特發表關於重大戰局之談話，披瀝完成聖戰之决意，幷力說當日海軍邀擊大敵，意氣軒易奮戰之際，日一憶國民亦應本諸海軍之决意，深自猛省各自之任務，而各盡所能，茲錄其大意如次：帝國海軍刻仍邀擊大敵，意氣軒昂，勇敢奮戰中，吾人對此决定皇國興廢之重大時局，務須以小畏犧牲之决意，作萬全之準備，帝國海軍决國結全軍，於必勝信念下與陸軍緊密協力，俾期獲得最後勝利也。</p>
<h3>松島報道部長昨發表談話對殉國將士表示敬意</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日大木營二十五日發表，日陸海軍守備隊四千五百名及隨軍人員二千名，於本年一月三十日及二月一日在內南洋最前綫之庫埃茲林。魯奧特二島登陸，與敵約二師激烈戰鬥後，全員壯烈犧牲消息傳布後，聞者無不義憤塡應，日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，特於同日接見記者，闡明日本一億國民因美國此次之攻　益為奮勵，為獲得澈底勝利起見，雖千萬犧牲亦所不惜，茲誌其內容如次：自阿圖島以來，第三次發表壯烈犧牲消息，聞者無不義憤塡膺，然吾人士氣，並不因此稍有動痛，且反越益鼓勇，獲取最後勝利。庫埃茲林及魯奧特守備隊，負保衛內南洋最前綫之重責，自開戰以來，屢與敵軍惡戰，歷一嘗艱辛，至少遭受十倍以上敵軍之攻擊，奮戰約一星期後，終於壯烈爲國犧牲，自小田·秋山二將軍以下之約四千五百勇士及約二千之隨軍人員，均遺下報國熱血，而化爲護國之神，尤以海軍少佐音羽正　侯，以高貴玉身，奮戰前綫，卒壯烈犧牲，深信一億國民之敵愾心，因此必益奮昂，無論在滅敵作戰上；或國民團結上及戰力增強上，均將發揮劇時代之光輝，忠烈為國捐驅之六千五百日木男子所予敵人損害，袛少在三倍以上，吾人不惜干萬犧牲，譽以澈底獲勝决意，以表無限敬意。</p>
<h3>印邊英人考慮撤退</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　阿拉坎前綫續佔絕對之優勢作戰，進行極爲順利，敵蒙特巴頓總司令，昨曾發表公報，承認該方面英第十四軍（以第五第七兩師團爲主幹）已陷於重大危機，蓋因日軍包抄突進繞至英軍背後，英軍兵站綫已陷於重大危境，如英第七師因納蓋德庫嶺之要衝被日軍遮斷，已完全陷於孤立。現英軍部隊正開往前綫增援，然日軍之攻擊極為猛烈。故終未能達到目的，同時印度國民軍呼應日軍精銳之猛攻，協力日軍，已開始向新德里進攻。彼等充滿解放祖國之熱情，於印度三色國旗下繼續奮鬥，印度國民軍最高司令部曾於二十一日發表國民軍之活動狀况，聞明印度國民軍協力在日溪方面作戰中之日軍作戰，與日軍部隊主力共同前進，刻正於那喀恩附近奮戰中。英印軍中印人部隊，蓋以印度民衆達成獨立之時機已迫在眉睫，故印度民衆之反英情緒，於大東亞戰爭發生以後。愈形濃厚，致使英印當局惑受重大威脅。印總督府惟恐印度民衆動搖，最近愈加強彈壓反英份子，同時利用親英份子，向印人展開對日木之惡劣宣傳，而印度國民軍於此次阿拉坎作戰中，與日軍立於同一戰綫，為解放印度，已完成突破印度國境之態勢，影響印度民衆甚大，故英印當局彈壓或柔懷印人之手段，終必失敗。據傳以英印當局之彌縫乎段，已難收拾今日之印度情勢，最近有大批印度靑年越過邊境，前來報效印度國民軍，據彼等談稱，孟加拉阿薩密及印度東部一帶之反英情緒，愈益濃厚，尤其於英軍在阿拉坎戰錢失敗以後，居住於孟加拉及阿薩密兩省之英人頗惑不安，英國資本家成感危險，平已收回投資，邊境地帶之英人，亦考慮全體撤退。總之，阿拉坎戰綫英軍慘敗及印度國民軍崛起以後，印度情勢更形嚴重。</p>
<h3>阿內閣辭職</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日巾央社電德國新聞社訊，此問頃接獲烏拉圭京城來電，蹬實阿根廷內閣全體已辭職。</p>
<h3>滿建國紀念派使節赴日將舉行興亞演講大會</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　三月一日為滿洲建國十二週年紀念，屆時滿政府特派興農部大臣黃富俊氏爲興亞使節赴日，日大政翼贊會為表歡迎，特籌備舉行滿洲建國紀念興亞大演講會及興亞國民運動，茲悉三月一日滿建國節之際，將由日大政　　會，興亞總木部及大東亞省陸軍省，農商省，情報局援助下，於是日下午一時半起假此間日比谷公會堂舉行興亞大講演會，由黃使節講演。翌日（二日）召開大政翼贊會之國民運動團體幹部懇談會，八日於仙合市，十二日於大阪市，十六日於禁岡市等地，順序黃使節之隨員尹敬章，魏鴻壽兩靑年代表，與大日木靑少年團共同主辦日滿靑年興亞交歡講演會及座談會。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　滿洲國興農部大臣黃富俊，為與日政府商討滿洲國之興農政策，二十五日下午一時四十分乘機飛抵此問，卞榻帝國旅館。</p>
<h3>日軍防禦系統　完整無缺西愛基博士討論戰局</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　西愛基博士於比奧拔塞報以「特魯克與東京之間」為題，以討論南太平洋之戰局，據稱：吾人對美海長之言論，甚少寄予同意，但諾克斯所稱「並無理由足以相信對日戰爭即將結東之語，」乃係非常正確者。彼更指出現行僅爲對日外圍之作戰，仍主獲侵入日軍四圍防禦系統，吾人稍一檢社地圖，即知此論無誤。於一年有半以來，美軍從事於反攻，除馬紹爾羣島面外，美軍並未能達到戰前日本所佔有這陣地，敵人於一九四三年八月在魁北克所誇稱，對日庥中進攻之預言，至今竟未實行，其同謀以作對日入勢之計劃者，其中重慶，英國，澳洲三個伙伴，已吿脫福，僅餘美國以從事於對日之攻勢。但美大軍係被牽制於歐洲，故其力不足在太平洋作有效之攻勢，雖美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資大將已發展其相當之攻擊力量，此可於其最近對特魯克島見之。日軍坦白承認美軍之攻擊及其自身之損失，即為此種攻擊乃係無關重要者之極佳證據。日人係認識美軍對馬紹爾羣島之作戰，乃為其第一次進入日軍勢力範圍之內，且將預期敵軍之繼績進攻，此南太平洋最近戰局，實足以教訓日本竭力擴充軍備之計劃之正確。美人自信其能以生產擊毀日木者，實乃忘懷歐洲戰塲消耗其大量生產之事實也。且太平洋戰區使其運輸及補給問題，幾爲不能解決者，西氏復引諾馬拉大將警告日人應予忍耐，日近於近期內袛能從事於增加戰力，以待良機，該報復登載東條自相之照片及太平洋之地圖。</p>
<h3>日音羽侯爵殉國晉升爲海軍少佐—日海軍省昨日下午發表—</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日海軍省二十五日下午四時發表：　日海軍大尉侯爵音羽正彥，已於二月六日在庫埃茲林島之激戰中壯烈戰死。　海軍大尉侯爵音羽正彥已於二月六日進級為海軍少佐</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日海軍省副官頃就音羽侯爵戰死事發表談話：大意謂：音羽侯爵自戰前即於陸奧艦上任副砲長兼分隊長，昭和十八年六月人海軍砲術學校高等科，專心研究砲術，以優良成績畢業該校後，志願赴第一綫服務，乃於同年十一月在大鳥島，繼於十二月在馬紹爾羣島方面，均會被委為部隊參謀。音羽侯爵常以貴族之身份於最前給活躍，昭和十三年八月會率上海日海軍特別陸戰隊砲隊參加溯江作戰。於半壁山之激戰中，擊潰敵軍，建樹偉動，榮獲全鵄動章，此次終於壯烈戰死，實不勝惑慨之至。</p>

<h3>日軍控制下的　緬印邊境立體戰爭</h3>
<p>勢所必然的時機，已經來臨了。自蒙特巴頓任英軍司令以來，世界所注視的緬甸戰局，果然發生很大的波瀾。緬甸於英國是保衛印度所不司缺的防壁，於重憂和美國，在對日戰略上，爲非實現克服不可的地方。因此敵軍陣營，斷然調動人事，賓旅緬甸反攻的戰略。</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓爲英國有數名門出身的提督，他的父親密爾福特海平元帥，曾任英海軍的軍令部長，他亦即是維多利女王的會孫，他年齡四十四歲，在奎貝克會議後，遂任侖他爲東南亞洲軍總司令官，代替現任印督華威爾，派到印度。他曾在法國北部狄埃浦港登陸作戰時，遭受德軍的猛烈反攻，去年三月，敵英國仿傚美國的海兵隊，編組專事登陸的奇製部隊，他便任第一任的司令官，北非的登睦作戰，總算成功了，登陸作戰，可謂他的營爲。</p>
<p>摧毀敵軍</p>
<p>去年九月，敵軍陣營內部，因爲新編組東南亞洲軍隊總司令部，有幾分新鮮和期待，那是不可否認的，於是世界都關心緬甸戰局將有一大波瀾。或謂英軍將越過孟加拉灣，印度洋，實施大登陸作戰，或說日英兩軍在大陸戰綫，將展開星加坡戰事以來的决戰。克復緬甸等，好像大東呀戰爭戰局的焦點，操在蒙特巴頓一個人的腦中一般，約有半年間，各方而都發生這這樣的印象。</p>
<p>然而事實怎樣呢？大陸戰綫作戰的中導權究屬誰人之手中？不錯的。自蒙特巴頓調任以來，這半年間，大有一觸即發乏概。兩軍的緊張戰機，一直繼續下去，敵軍內部，拚侖的準備了，穿過山脈與森林的作戰道路開鑒工程，日就進展，集中很大的兵力，一方面重慶軍在北方阜康地區及雲南國境，積極行動起來，南方孟加拉灣方面，敵軍陸上兵力，不斷地蠢動，敵軍在緬甸周圍，佈置包園的陣勢，於是緬甸的戰局漸次成熟，於十月上旬，日軍首先向北方騰衡及密之那方面的重慶軍開始攻擊了。短促之間，日軍已予一萬七千的重慶軍以殲減的打擊而把重慶軍趕入怒江東岸地區，於是敵軍由南北方饗應包團緬甸的企圖，被打碎了。</p>
<p>敵軍半年間的準備</p>
<p>準備大致就緒的英軍，至十二月下旬，其行動逐漸表面化起來，敵軍在北方阜康地區及布其頓前方的南部地區，加緊積極的行動，前哨戰事漸漸地劇烈，迨至一月中旬，勢將引起重大波瀾。果於二月四日，日軍在布其頓，孟達正面，開始全而的攻勢，「緬甸反攻」的作戰中導權，並不在英軍掌中反被日軍掌握。不過戰局是極重大的。敵軍陣營，已有半年的準備，戰塲是在以馬猶山的巍峨森林爲中心，又是阿拉坎山脈特別的三角地帶。密密的森林和澗地，無論是攻擊者，或防禦者，都沒有像平坦戰塲那樣的便宜。日英兩軍就在這困難的戰場，要開始爭門了，敵人英國，因爲要繼續霸佔東亞唯一的還庫印度，可謂一個拚命的戰事，而這次的戰事，就是日英兩軍第二次的大决戰。不但如此，去年秋間，在那劃時代的大東來會議席上，吶喊「以血爭取祖國印度」的印度臨時已由政府領袖江特拉波斯，亦領率印度國民軍隊，協助日軍，開始向祖國進軍了。</p>
<p>進入一大決戰</p>
<p>目下戰門雖屬初期，但由戰塲傳來的消息，巳展開劇烈的戰事。在森林與三角地帶的隆隆砲聲，在天空上的空中决戰，集中戰車重砲的英軍近代裝確，把密林和河水，澄榮的天空遮蓋了的劇戰，眞是日英兩軍的近代立體戰，勢極慘烈。</p>
<p>前年五月戡定緬甸全境的長大作戰，其主要在山岳的劇戰，而去年秋間的曇南作戰，也是山岳戰事之一，然而這次的新作戰，乃是空陸一體的近代劇戰。</p>
<p>敵人英國，並不是自任侖蒙特巴頓以來，便想開始克復緬甸，其第一次的攻學，發生於前年年底至去年春間，即華威爾的那一次一阿拉坎悲劇一。首先狂炸緬甸各都市，繼即在阿拉坎配置兩師大兵，這一次攻勢，英國已受致命的打擊，從此己閱十個月，英軍滿懷自信，與傾注力量準備，開始第二次的攻擊，這又在中途，被日軍先制機先。於是日英兩軍進入一大的决鐵階段了（弘譯自二月九日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>殲滅戰的展開</p>
<p>四天以來，在布其頓正面展開的對敵第七師團的攻勢作戰，繼續從布其頓方面北上急行進緊，在呼應主力之先，通過馬猶河右岸孟多山脈，會合從頓古巴扎南下，直衝敵第七師團後方的迂迴部隊之猛攻。敵人毫無準備，指揮系絲頓陷於混亂，四分五裂，彷徨於馬猶山中。這一戰役現因日軍包圍鐵環的緊縮，在各地兜截殘敵，已到達了個別擊減的最後階段。九日黃昏，日軍部隊在布其頓西北方約八公里的馬猶山中的烏拉平及與塞華中問地區，完全包圍至少約有英兵一千。卡車百輛所組成的敵軍部隊，目前正在展開殲減戰中。</p>
<p>又先前進出於頓古巴扎的日軍，派遺先遣隊赴納根根遮斷從孟多通吉大港方面的汽車路，使敵後方補給不可能，並阻止殘敵的溃逃。九日，向頓古巴扎進發的日軍有力新銳機動部隊，在孟多，納根根的中間地區，截斷前述汽車路，使包圍綫愈形週密。</p>
<p>因此，日軍的包圍攻擊，愈形激烈，戰事愈見確實而迅速地進歷。此次戰役開始以來，密切協力日軍，勇敢作戰的自由印度國民軍，在擊減仇敵英印軍的戰事中，士氣日趨激昂，在各地頗著戰績。目前日軍的攻擊，在殲滅敵第七師的戰事中，正在續獲赫赫戰果，而敵第五師團亦在日軍包圍鐵環下，有似袋鼠之狀。（翔·譯自二月十二日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>美軍企圖化中國爲戰塲　松島報道部長談話</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊松島報道部長，昨會見中國記者時就最近戰局，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>企圖化中國爲戰塲</p>
<p>今天關於下列幾項問題，試加以說明：最近的　局，特別希望諸位注意的，就是最近美國人力的資源愈感缺乏，在本月十六日，太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米么發表從馬紹兩羣島方面轉向特魯克方面，進人中國大陸，利用中國軍力，和日本作最後的决戰，美國道種計劃，正和日本的新政策完全相反。日本由於新政策的實施，逐漸給予中國以新的生命－就是和平，現在中國民衆，所以忍耐一切的困難，也是爲了確信將來一定有和平實現。比如說：在去年冬天，各處沒有水汀和火爐，可是因確信在將來一二年後，一定會得着温暖的生活。但是美國在接近中國的時候，便要使中國變成一個血的戰塲了。我在當時，對於尼米茲的言論，會發表過猛烈的反對，日木無論受到怎樣的懷牲，曰定要擊退跨海而來進攻中國的美國軍隊</p>
<p>再圖開闢緬甸公路</p>
<p>最近敵方企圖從緬甸方面開關「里度Ledo公路」，進入中國大陸，要而言之。這完全是英美因爲人的資源不足，而欲利用中國的人民，犧牲中國的人民，來爭取地們的最後勝利</p>
<p>我特別要告訴重慶人民的，把英美引進中國大陸來的時候，是絕對不能得到勝利的，這祇有把中國化成一個悽慘的戰塲。最近美國動員十數萬的大學生，使之參加戰爭，但這些人員，對於太平洋的戰爭，是沒有什麼補助的，結局美國最後的企圖，還是想利用中國人民。作最後的决戰。</p>
<p>對於我的這種反對論，在二十三日敵美海軍部長諾克斯會發表調：「美軍並沒有進人中國大陸的意圖，」這明明是一個詭辯，　美國海軍的最高權威者尼米茲，和諾克斯所發表的這種相反的意見，可以知道其結果，是一種欺騙掩飾的勾當。尼沐茲的計劃，是經過馬紹爾，特魯克，菲律濱，進入中國，以中國爲最後的戰塲而作戰，進攻日木，另一路綫，即由細甸經由里度公路而進人中國，對此，重廖方面也有很感興趣的人，但是如果美國眞的進入中國，以中國爲戰塲時，中國是絕對得不到幸福，遺是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>太平洋上擊退美軍</p>
<p>最近美國首腦部人物，會發表最重要的戰塲，就是上海，所以今日日本在太平洋上努力的擊退美軍，也就是爲了使中國不致化成悽慘的戰塲，這是要請諸位特別注意的。如果美國這杯企圖一旦實現，重慶政府的　部份人或許會惑到幸福，但是全中國的民衆·却都要義牲了。所以諾克斯很慌張的把尼米茲所發表的取消，原因也就在此。</p>
<p>其次，對於最近日本統帥部的變更，有一美國新聞記者，曾在東京住過很長久的期間，對日本國內情形，頗爲熟悉，彼發出如下的謠言：在這次統帥部變更時，前任總參謀長和軍令部總長都被賜死，這價是極大的笑話。日本對於統師部的變更，從前也曾　表過，就是期的政戰兩略的一致，已　退職的兩之帥，現巳補在最重要的軍事參請官。</p>
<p>英美軍隊殘暴一斑</p>
<p>此外，關於英美兩國軍隊的殘暴，試加說明：最近最可憐的新聞，就是甘地夫人以七十四歲的高齡，死於獄中，這不但是印度三億四千萬人的悲痛，也是東亞十億人民的悲痛。這和美國擊沉兵員船和燈塔監視船的洗星號，同出一轍。</p>
<p>印度國民會議派對於甘地夫人的死，預備發表追悼文，但被總督強制壓迫小得發表，因而使國民會議派議員，全數從議塲退出。</p>
<p>經過長時期的獄中生活，又死在獄中，在死後連追悼文也不許公開，這眞是全東亚民族的血淚史。</p>
<p>同時，與此有關的事情，希望各位注意的，就是重慶派遺熊式輝。張治中。徐永昌等往緬甸印用方面，親察重慶軍隊時，所發表談話於指摘最近指揮系統的紊亂以後，並談及印度軍將投向日木軍的空氣，相當濃厚，這也不外乎印度軍對甘地及其夫人的同情而發的憤慨。</p>
<p>關於在前面已提到過的流星號，從其中飄浮水面的中國人，全被美國飛機用機槍掃射而死，其中有很可憐的母親抱着小孩，也被掃射以死，對這大概諸位還不致忘記吧：</p>
<p>類似這組殘虐的行爲，在意大利戰綫，荷蘭戰綫，以汲此利時空製的時候，也是如此，彼等更盲炸敎堂，無數敎士都遭慘死。</p>
<p>竟鼓吹使用毒瓦斯</p>
<p>最近華盛頓有力的新聞紙，時當慫恿政府對太平洋作戰使用毒瓦斯，照他們的意思·在中國戰綫，也同樣的要使用毒瓦斯，所以這不但是日木軍隊的問題，對於中國也很重安，同時日木軍在太平洋上學退　軍，也是篇了使中國免遭毒瓦斯的威屑。的立塲，來看今日的時局，也是要希望日本得到勝利，這原因就是使英美從太平洋方面或緬甸方面進入中國而化成戰塲時，不僅是中國民衆都將受到犧牲，就是重慶方面要人的家屬，也不會希望英美來蹂躪的，所以要把英美引入中國，以中國爲　據地而進攻日本的思想，是完全錯誤的，同時在進攻日本之前，中國是必先要遭到犧牲，這也是諸位所必須特別注意的經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>如何名副其實？</h3>
<p>大家都知道現今的物資缺乏，由於有人囤積物資，現今的物價騰貴，由於有人操縱物價，至於國積爲誰？操縱爲誰？大家固不能全都知道，即有知道者，亦祇覺敢怒而不敢言。由於這樣一個環境，竟會使一個戰時國家的物價問題被驅於窮途上面去了，言之可不痛心？</p>
<p>我們以前固當論及統制經濟下的應有的覺悟，就是要「右福同享」，「有飯大家吃」，不要再以「充分滿足自己的慾望」爲前提。統制經濟之所以合乎時代的需要，正是因爲這個原則，也就是經濟學中的實利主義；所謂實利主義，即在於增加人類快樂之總量：使抑制少數人或一部分之快樂而可以增加全體人民之快樂，其抑制即爲時代所需要；使由此而可以使全體人民獲得快樂，則強迫施行其抑制尤爲必要。這便是統制經濟適合經濟學原理的一點，爲我們政府與人民所當十致認淸的。</p>
<p>可是，統制經濟一經實施以後，則必須名副其實，否則其結果必視自由經濟的陷於無政府狀熊爲尤甚，而人民所受痛苦，必益將陷於水深火熟之中了。我們鑒於物資調查委員會最近計劃之強化與工作之緊張，覺得旣爲物資調查，則顧各思義，對於現今囤積物資與操　物資的泉源，實應擴大其調查的範團，強化其調查的步驟。我們認爲最近平津兩市斷然實行檢舉囤積投機與私抬物價，商店而外，並及於私人住宅之檢查，確不失爲「用快刀斬亂麻」的方法，可資我們取效的。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豊雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>海龜（八）</p>
<p>那天夜裹就寢前的一刻鐘，學生館的寢室，眞是熟鬧得很。在一號學生這是最後的休假，不久就要到那風雲緊急的太平洋上去，而四號學生，却穿着純白的第二種軍裝，腰帶着短劍，初次回到故鄉去，所以胸口突突地跳着，話聲捲起了漩渦。</p>
<p>初夜巡檢完學後，電燈雖巳熄減，可是俱人總睡不着。</p>
<p>（一回故鄉，立即就到東鄉墓地去參拜……）這樣地想着。</p>
<p>（母親若看着我的樣子，一定要驚訝的：）又這樣的想着。</p>
<p>（一定要將我的黑色給隆夫看看……）</p>
<p>穿着這樣很威風的軍服，母親一定耍喜歡的，但是均隆夫倒好像很難爲情的。在炎太下的槍術訓練和游泳，從休假前就變成黑色了的身體，不但是薩夫，同時也希望給諸位先生看看的。</p>
<p>眞人在閱中，自己嬉嬉地笑着。同四個月以的的自己，相比較起來，在心中感到十二分的滿足。自己己經不是「俗世」的人了。是受過馴練的，將來是有確定的前途的——自己巳經在設想，明朝大時，圾爽地踏出校門時的勇敢的資態。</p>
<p>兵學校論（一）</p>
<p>作者利用谷俱人不在的時間，對海軍兵學校作一個簡單的感想和討諭。說老實話，作者的計劃，是以描寫眞人的江田島生活，來介紹兵學校的全貌的，但是終於感到這遠非捕　所可及的。因爲兵學校的會體是那樣地龐大複雜，內容是極深奧而有特殊性的。要用小說的形式來表現，就是寫一百章也恐怕不够。因此，不得不採取這樣間搜的方法。</p>
<p>原來耍正式訪問這個學校，是應常從海上來的。學校的正門而臨着海，但那是無門之門，只有碼頭同木柵。眞正有訪問這學校的資格的人，是要坐海軍艦艇，你正門進來的。像作者不必說只有利用公共汽車，從銀行對面的裹門進去的，所以談感想和議論，確實沒有眞正的資格。海軍兵學校是這樣莊巖的存在，是不容許一般人窺視的。</p>
<p>總而言之，從裏門到校內，有朱色同白色的學生館，碧緣的大草地，由蒼　的大松樹問遠遠地透視着能美島的山影－先要使我們感歎那環境的美麗。同時要驚獻那一塵不染的淸凈的環境。接着又驚異在那裹沒有逍遙來往的人。驚異那身着白色作業服的學牛們，用那純潔天偵地舉止，作一絲不紊而有規律的行動。在那時候，人人都要在這裹像發見呈地似的，要使人起一種從遠處聽到鐘聲一樣的錯覺。戒律的，自然的，超凡的存在－環境和人，一切的一切，都要使人受到一種好像進了雪斯脫寺院（一六六〇年創立於瑙曼，脫拉發地方）內似的印象。</p>
<p>然而不久我們就要覺悟，那不過是從裏門進去的人的惑傷。在這裘雖然有信念，然而却沒有信仰。並目學生並沒有效法那宗敎的愛和獻身的必要，他們巳經是軍人了。身侖已經不是自己的東西。在他們是沒有所謂迷途和悟道，唯有一定的信念，而加以琢磨就可以的。</p>
<p>然而那方法，也有像苦修和苦綫的地方。就是登宮島的彌山同總短艇的舉行。前者是五里長的石階，必須一鼓氣跑到山巔的競賽。無論如何的健壯者，也要在中　走着蹌跟難　的險通。然而爲分隊的名譽起見，累倒的人也要拾着到决勝點去的。總短　也是如此，在嚴寒的冬季，號令一下，那要自己一個人將那市的短艦放下來，一個人搖到二公里的地點，同時還得　到原來的位置的。這也是帶淚的苦行，廣瀨中佐在學的時代，據說是登彌山同總短艦要一齊舉行的。</p>

<h3>借米債和捐米會的意見</h3>
<p>— 福原</p>
<p>我覺得現在社會上大冬數的隱貧，以前並非好吃懶做之流，因爲不善於應付環境，以前雖略有儲稱，給環境支配，都莫不變得難以生存了。要想去向親友處借貸嗎，雖說鈔票不值錢，可是誰亦不愿將印鈔去借給別人，除非有百念分的情面，方得借到，這不可厚非。貸款者因爲物價天天漲，刻刻高，誰願蒙受這種損失呢？所以我以爲這借米價同捐米會，或許值得提供與社會人士共同研究一下吧。</p>
<p>所謂借米價，便是某甲向乙商借現款，其數折以當日之沐價，即黑市公價。倘所借洋一千元，當日之米價爲三千三百元者，可於借據上書明借米三斗，而每月之息若干，則到期視米價折現。倘每石漲至四千元，月息二分，則支付月息八十元，其他一切，不妨根據戰事之前手續。歸回時，米價下跌，亦須以米價爲依歸。</p>
<p>捐米會之法亦可相同辦理捐集之會，亦折以當日之黑市么價米值，而按明之會款會息，亦折以當日之市值，庶雙方不受幣值上下之苦。這是一個整個計會的經濟問題。或須能够因此減少物價的上漲性，因爲這樣一來，通貨亦能多一出路，况且貸方每月可凈收其厘，時局無論怎樣推異，米究竟是最注要的生活要素之一，物價的上下，都不能脫離這一問題，我不過提供這一一點私見，供大家討論。</p>

        <h1>1944.02.26</h1>
<h3>Spirit of Shattered Jade</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that approximately 4,500 Imperial Army and Navy troops defending Kuezeling Island and Ruote Island, along with 2,000 military personnel assisting in the defense, had been engaged in fierce battles with the enemy Americans since January 30th. After inflicting significant losses on the enemy, they launched a final assault on February 6th, gloriously sacrificing themselves for their country. Upon hearing this tragic news, in addition to expressing our respect and condolences to the martyred soldiers of our allied nation, we particularly feel that the traditional spirit of the allied soldiers, who regard death as going home, is a great force that cannot be threatened or underestimated by any enemy. At the same time, this spirit is the guarantee of defeating the enemy and winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Attu Island last May and the Battle of Makin Island and others in December last year, the allied defense forces all fought against attacking enemies ten or a hundred times their number with the brave spirit of "one against ten." After making the enemy pay the greatest price, they resisted the enemy until the last bullet before gloriously sacrificing themselves for their country. The battles of Kuezeling Island and Ruote Island are the most powerful illustration of the Japanese army's display of loyalty and courage. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed that every soldier in the Japanese army, from generals to privates, possesses the will to serve the country. They not only have absolutely no weakness of fear or retreat but also increasingly strengthen their psychology of shared hatred against the enemy. This is also the guarantee of defeating the enemy and winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In this battle, although more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers and military personnel were sacrificed, judging from common sense, the enemy Americans must have sacrificed far more than the number of Japanese troops. This is because the Japanese army, before preparing to sacrifice themselves, must be entirely brave and courageous, and they will not stop until they have annihilated the enemy to the last bit of strength. On the other hand, the enemy forces are adventuring into enemy territory, acting timid and fearful. It is conceivable that, under such a comparison, the enemy army completely overwhelms the Japanese army in terms of numbers, so the great number of losses suffered by the enemy can be imagined. Secondly, the number of American people drafted into military service has reached one-thirteenth of the population, and it takes the strength of sixteen people in the rear to support one soldier. Therefore, the population feels insufficient, and the labor force has decreased by three million. Thus, Mexican and South American farmers are mobilized to the United States to engage in labor. However, in Japan, the number of people drafted into military service is only one-twenty-fifth of the population. Therefore, Japan has ample resources to replenish its military manpower. From the perspective of the mobilized numbers of troops, the allied nation of Japan is incomparable to the enemy Americans. This is also the guarantee of winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>There is an ancient Chinese proverb that says, "It is better to be shattered jade than to be a whole tile." Now, the soldiers of our allied nation of Japan all possess this spirit and firmly hold this belief. However, looking back at our China, although the ancients had the heroic spirit of preferring shattered jade to a whole tile, now, if we face a critical juncture, do we have the legacy that the ancients showed us? This is questionable. We open our eyes to observe that the current social state is filled with an atmosphere of speculation, opportunism, and fence-sitting. People only know their own petty selfish interests and disregard the public good, let alone the spirit of sacrifice. The more deeply rooted the phenomenon of speculation and opportunism becomes, the more the national morality declines, the more the sense of public interest fades, and the more the spirit of sacrifice disappears. The current high prices, rampant hoarding and speculation, and other phenomena all arise from the decline of national morality. During our participation in the war, if our social state is like this, and we look back at the Japanese people, who are filled with a tense emotion of hatred against the enemy and are unanimously striving to participate in the war, in comparison, we are truly ashamed.</p>
<h3>Glorious Sacrifice of Japanese Garrison Troops on Kuezeling and Other Islands; Inflicted Enormous Damage on Attacking Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (China-France News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 25th: Approximately 4,500 Imperial Army and Navy troops defending Kuezeling Island and Ruote Island have been engaged in fierce battles with the attacking enemy forces under intense bombing since January 30th. Our troops fought bravely and fiercely, repelling the enemy and inflicting enormous damage. On February 6th, they launched a final assault. All of them gloriously died in battle. The commander of the Ruote Island garrison was Rear Admiral Michiyuki Yamada, and the commander of the Kuezeling Island garrison was Rear Admiral Monzao Akiyama. Furthermore, approximately 2,000 military personnel on both islands assisted the garrison troops in their fierce fighting, and all of them shared the fate of the garrison troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Minister Shimada Expresses Determination to Complete the Holy War and Cooperate with the Army to Fight for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Navy Minister Shimada, after the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 25th, issued a statement regarding the major war situation, expressing his determination to complete the holy war. He also emphasized that when the Navy is intercepting the enemy and fighting bravely with high morale, the one hundred million people of Japan should also base themselves on the Navy's determination, deeply reflect on their respective tasks, and do their best. The gist of his statement is as follows: The Imperial Navy is currently intercepting the enemy and fighting bravely with high morale. We must make all preparations with the determination to sacrifice everything for this critical moment that determines the fate of the Empire. The Imperial Navy is determined to unite the entire army and cooperate closely with the Army under the belief of certain victory, so as to achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Director of Reporting Department Matsushima Expresses Respect for Martyred Soldiers in Yesterday's Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 25th that 4,500 Japanese Army and Navy garrison troops and 2,000 accompanying personnel landed on Kuezeling and Ruote Islands, the front lines of the inner South Pacific, on January 30th and February 1st of this year and engaged in fierce battles with approximately two enemy divisions. After the news of the glorious sacrifice of all of them spread, everyone who heard it was filled with righteous indignation. Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, met with reporters on the same day and explained that the one hundred million people of Japan are further encouraged by this attack by the United States. In order to achieve a thorough victory, they will not hesitate to make thousands of sacrifices. The content is recorded as follows: Since Attu Island, this is the third time that news of glorious sacrifices has been announced. Everyone who hears it is filled with righteous indignation. However, our morale has not been shaken in the slightest by this, and instead, we are increasingly encouraged to achieve final victory. The Kuezeling and Ruote garrisons bear the important responsibility of defending the front lines of the inner South Pacific. Since the beginning of the war, they have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the enemy forces and have experienced hardships. They have suffered attacks from at least ten times the number of enemy troops. After fighting fiercely for about a week, they finally gloriously sacrificed themselves for their country. Approximately 4,500 brave soldiers under the command of Generals Oda and Akiyama and approximately 2,000 accompanying personnel all left behind their patriotic blood and transformed into guardian deities of the country. In particular, Lieutenant Commander Masahiko Otowa, a nobleman, fought bravely on the front lines with his noble body and finally sacrificed himself gloriously. It is firmly believed that the enemy-hating hearts of the one hundred million people will be further encouraged by this. Whether in destroying the enemy in battle or in national unity and the strengthening of war power, they will all display the brilliance of a great era. The six thousand five hundred Japanese men who loyally sacrificed themselves for the country inflicted at least three times the damage on the enemy. We will spare no thousands of sacrifices and express our infinite respect with the determination to win a thorough victory.</p>
<h3>British in Indian Border Area Consider Retreat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The battle on the Arakan front continues with an absolute advantage, and the progress is extremely smooth. Enemy Commander-in-Chief Mountbatten issued a public statement yesterday, admitting that the British 14th Army (mainly composed of the 5th and 7th Divisions) in that area has fallen into a major crisis. This is because the Japanese army has encircled and advanced to the rear of the British army, and the British army's supply lines have fallen into a major crisis. For example, the key point of Nagadeku Ridge of the British 7th Division was cut off by the Japanese army, and it has completely fallen into isolation. Currently, British troops are moving to the front lines to reinforce, but the Japanese army's attack is extremely fierce. Therefore, they have ultimately failed to achieve their purpose. At the same time, the Indian National Army is echoing the fierce attack of the elite Japanese army and cooperating with the Japanese army to begin advancing towards New Delhi. They are filled with the enthusiasm to liberate their motherland and continue to fight under the Indian tricolor flag. The Supreme Command of the Indian National Army issued a statement on the 21st regarding the activities of the National Army, revealing that the Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army operating in the Nisshi area and advancing together with the main force of the Japanese army, and is currently fighting fiercely near Nagaon. The Indian troops in the British Indian Army believe that the opportunity for the Indian people to achieve independence is imminent. Therefore, the anti-British sentiment of the Indian people has become increasingly strong since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, causing the British Indian authorities to feel a major threat. The Indian Governor-General's Office fears that the Indian people will waver and has recently strengthened the suppression of anti-British elements. At the same time, it is using pro-British elements to launch malicious propaganda against Japan to the Indian people. However, the Indian National Army is standing on the same front as the Japanese army in this Arakan operation. In order to liberate India, it has completed the posture of breaking through the Indian border, which has had a great impact on the Indian people. Therefore, the British Indian authorities' means of suppressing or appeasing the Indian people will ultimately fail. It is rumored that the British Indian authorities' attempts to remedy the situation have been unable to salvage today's situation in India. Recently, a large number of Indian youths have crossed the border to report to the Indian National Army. According to their accounts, the anti-British sentiment in Bengal, Assam, and the eastern part of India is becoming increasingly strong. Especially after the British army's failure in the battle of Arakan, the British living in the provinces of Bengal and Assam are quite uneasy. British capitalists feel the danger and have already withdrawn their investments. The British in the border areas are also considering a complete retreat. In short, after the British army's disastrous defeat on the Arakan front and the rise of the Indian National Army, the situation in India has become even more serious.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Defense System is Complete and Flawless; Dr. Westaki Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Dr. Westaki discussed the war situation in the South Pacific in the "Bio Beobachter" under the title "Between Truk and Tokyo." It is said that we rarely agree with the remarks of the US Navy Secretary, but Knox's statement that "there is no reason to believe that the war against Japan is about to end" is very correct. He further pointed out that the current operations are only on the periphery of Japan and still focus on invading the Japanese defense system. We only need to check the map to know that this argument is correct. For the past year and a half, the US military has engaged in counterattacks, but except for the Marshall Islands, the US military has not been able to reach the positions occupied by Japan before the war. The predictions made by the enemy in Quebec in August 1943 about the offensive against Japan have not yet been realized. Of the conspirators who planned to enter Japan, the three partners of Chongqing, Britain, and Australia have been abandoned, leaving only the United States to engage in the offensive against Japan. However, the US military is being constrained in Europe, so it lacks the strength to launch an effective offensive in the Pacific. Although US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz has developed considerable attacking power, this can be seen in his recent attack on Truk Island. The fact that the Japanese military frankly admits the US military's attack and its own losses is excellent evidence that this attack is insignificant. The Japanese recognize that the US military's operation in the Marshall Islands is their first entry into the Japanese sphere of influence and will anticipate the enemy's continued attacks. This recent battle in the South Pacific is enough to teach the correctness of Japan's plan to expand its military equipment. The Americans' confidence that they can destroy Japan with production forgets the fact that the European battlefield consumes a large amount of its production. Moreover, the Pacific theater makes its transportation and supply problems almost unsolvable. Westaki also quoted Admiral Nomura's warning to the Japanese to be patient, and Japan can only engage in increasing its war power in the near future to await a good opportunity. The newspaper also published a photo of Prime Minister Tojo and a map of the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marquis Otowa Sacrificed and Promoted to Lieutenant Commander - Japanese Navy Ministry Announced Yesterday Afternoon -</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 4:00 PM on the 25th: Japanese Navy Lieutenant Marquis Masahiko Otowa gloriously died in the fierce battle on Kuezeling Island on February 6th.

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The aide-de-camp of the Japanese Navy Ministry recently issued a statement on the death of Marquis Otowa, saying in essence: Marquis Otowa served as the deputy gunner and squad leader on the Mutsu ship before the war. In June of Showa 18 (1943), he entered the Advanced Course of the Naval Gunnery School and concentrated on studying gunnery. After graduating from the school with excellent grades, he volunteered to serve on the front lines. In November of the same year, he was assigned as a staff officer to the unit on Otorishima Island, and then in December in the Marshall Islands. Marquis Otowa often played an active role on the front lines as a nobleman. In August of Showa 13 (1938), he led the artillery team of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Special Landing Force to participate in the Yangtze River operation. In the fierce battle of Banbishan, he defeated the enemy and made a great contribution, winning the Golden Kite Medal. This time, he finally died gloriously in battle, which is extremely regrettable.</p>

<h3>Goebbels Expresses Germany's Strong Will to Spare No Sacrifices to Win Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels wrote in the German Weekly that the German nation will surely be able to win victory through its strong will. The date for the enemy's military actions to attack Western Europe is approaching. The British and Americans are indecisive and know that in this critical juncture, a slight misstep will result in victory for Germany. Some observers believe that the attack on Western Europe may bring the war into a decisive stage. Regardless of the outcome, it can be asserted that the entire war situation will completely change in a short period of time after the attack on Europe is launched. Judging from the current situation on the European fronts, the enemy should not be too optimistic. The German nation is confident in its ability to win the war. We are forced to fight and have only one way to fight to the end. To achieve freedom, no sacrifice will be spared. Although our work is arduous, it is by no means easier to endure than surrendering to the enemy. This belief will never waver.</p>

<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Second Class of Military Academy Students</h3>

The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM on the 25th at the academy's main parade ground. Commissioner Chen Gongbo represented concurrently the President Wang in presiding over the ceremony. Attendees included academy commissioners, heads of various agencies, guests Chu Minyi, Bao Wenyue, Ren Yuantong, Lieutenant General Rongshan from the Allied Powers, Colonel Yoshino, Colonel Sakurai, and over 700 people, including all faculty, staff, and students of the academy. A military parade was held before the opening ceremony. The chairman took his seat. Parade Commander Bao Wenpei reported the number of instructors and students present. The military parade was held, and a divisional parade was held amidst the resounding military music. The students' steps were neat and their spirits were high, which was highly praised by the officers. After the divisional parade, the opening ceremony was held on the parade ground.

<p>Chen Committee Represents President Wang to Give a Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Commissioner Chen Gongbo, representing President Wang, delivered a speech, the gist of which was that from now on, the students would be considered qualified as military academy students and must bear the responsibilities of military academy students. On May 15th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), when the first class of students held their opening ceremony, the speaker had said, "Today's opening ceremony is the first day that our dear students place the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending East Asia on their shoulders." What he had hoped for from the first class of students at the previous opening ceremony was the same as what he hoped for from the second class of students today. Moreover, since China participated in the Greater East Asia War, concluded an alliance treaty with Japan, and jointly issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, this significance is even more obvious and this responsibility is even greater. He earnestly hoped that all students would deeply understand this point, redouble their efforts, and bear the great responsibilities of this great era.</p>

<h3>Three-Dimensional Warfare on the Burmese-Indian Border Under Japanese Control</h3>
<p>The inevitable moment has arrived. Since Mountbatten took office as the British commander, the Burmese war situation, which the world has been watching, has indeed undergone great changes. To Britain, Burma is an indispensable defense wall for protecting India, and to China and the United States, it is a place that must be overcome in their strategy against Japan. Therefore, the enemy camp resolutely mobilized personnel and adopted a strategy of counter-offensive in Burma.</p>
<p>Mountbatten is a British admiral from a prestigious family. His father, Marshal Milford Haven, once served as the chief of staff of the British Navy. He is also a great-grandson of Queen Victoria. At the age of forty-four, after the Quebec Conference, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Southeast Asian Army, replacing the current Governor of India, Wavell, and sent to India. He suffered a fierce counter-offensive from the German army during the landing operation at Dieppe in northern France. Last March, the enemy British army imitated the American Marine Corps and formed a special force specializing in landing operations, and he was appointed as the first commander. The landing operation in North Africa was considered successful, and landing operations can be said to be his forte.</p>
<p>Destroying the Enemy</p>
<p>Last September, it was undeniable that there was some freshness and anticipation within the enemy camp due to the newly formed Southeast Asian Army Headquarters. As a result, the world was concerned that the Burmese war situation would undergo a major change. Some said that the British army would cross the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean to carry out a large-scale landing operation, while others said that the British and Japanese armies would launch a decisive battle on the mainland front similar to the Battle of Singapore. Recovering Burma, etc., seemed as if the focus of the Greater East Asia War was in Mountbatten's mind alone, and for about half a year, everyone had this impression.</p>
<p>But what is the truth? Who controls the initiative in the mainland front operations? That's right. Since Mountbatten's transfer, there has been a hair-trigger tension in the past six months. The tense situation between the two armies has continued. The enemy has been making frantic preparations, and the construction of operational roads through mountains and forests has progressed rapidly, concentrating a large amount of troops. On the one hand, the Chongqing army has been actively operating in the Fukang area of ​​northern Burma and the Yunnan border. On the south side of the Bay of Bengal, the enemy's land forces have been constantly acting. The enemy has laid out an encirclement around Burma, and the Burmese war situation has gradually matured. In early October, the Japanese army first launched an attack on the Chongqing army in the northern Tengchong and Myitkyina areas. In a short period of time, the Japanese army inflicted a crushing blow on 17,000 Chongqing troops, driving them to the east bank of the Nu River, and the enemy's attempt to encircle Burma from the north and south was shattered.</p>
<p>Six Months of Enemy Preparation</p>
<p>The British army, whose preparations were roughly in place, gradually began to make their actions public in late December. The enemy stepped up active operations in the Fukang area in the north and the southern area in front of Buthidaung. The skirmishes gradually intensified, and by mid-January, a major change was about to occur. Sure enough, on February 4th, the Japanese army began a full-scale offensive on the Buthidaung-Maungdaw front. The initiative in the "Burmese Counter-offensive" operation was not in the hands of the British army but was seized by the Japanese army. However, the war situation is extremely important. The enemy camp has been preparing for half a year, and the battlefield is centered on the towering forests of the Mayu Mountains, and is a special triangular area of ​​the Arakan Mountains. Dense forests and ravines do not provide the same advantages as flat battlefields for either the attacker or the defender. The British and Japanese armies are about to start a struggle in this difficult battlefield. The enemy, Britain, is fighting desperately because it wants to continue to occupy India, the only treasury in East Asia, and this battle is the second major decisive battle between the British and Japanese armies. Not only that, but last autumn, at the epoch-making Greater East Asia Conference, Chandra Bose, the leader of the Indian provisional government who shouted "Fight for the motherland India with blood," also led the Indian National Army to assist the Japanese army and began to march towards the motherland.</p>
<p>Entering a Major Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Although the battle is currently in its initial stage, news from the battlefield indicates that a fierce battle has begun. The rumbling cannons in the forests and triangular areas, the aerial decisive battles in the sky, and the British army's modern equipment concentrated with tanks and heavy artillery, are battles that cover the dense forests, rivers, and clear skies. It is truly a modern three-dimensional war between the British and Japanese armies, and the situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>The major operation to stabilize the entire territory of Burma in May of the year before last was mainly a fierce battle in the mountains, and the Yunnan operation in the autumn of last year was also one of the mountain battles. However, this new operation is a modern fierce battle that integrates air and land.</p>
<p>The enemy Britain did not start trying to recover Burma since the appointment of Mountbatten. Its first offensive occurred from the end of the year before last to the spring of last year, which was Wavell's "Arakan Tragedy". First, it frantically bombed various cities in Burma, and then deployed two divisions of troops in Arakan. This offensive was a fatal blow to Britain. Since then, ten months have passed, and the British army, full of confidence and pouring in its strength to prepare, began its second attack, which was again preempted by the Japanese army. As a result, the British and Japanese armies have entered a major decisive stage (Hong translated from the Asahi Shimbun on February 9th).</p>
<p>The Unfolding of the Annihilation Battle</p>
<p>For four days, the offensive operation against the enemy's 7th Division, which unfolded on the Buthidaung front, continued to advance rapidly north from Buthidaung. Before the main force could respond, it passed through the Maungdaw Mountains on the right bank of the Mayu River and joined forces with the roundabout troops that had descended from Tongubazar, directly attacking the rear of the enemy's 7th Division. The enemy was caught unprepared, and the command system fell into chaos. They were fragmented and wandered in the Mayu Mountains. This battle is now in its final stage of individual annihilation as the Japanese army tightens the iron ring of encirclement, intercepting the remnants of the enemy in various places. On the evening of the 9th, Japanese troops completely encircled a unit of the enemy army composed of at least about 1,000 British soldiers and 100 trucks in the Ula Ping and Seihua area in the Mayu Mountains, about eight kilometers northwest of Buthidaung. An annihilation battle is currently unfolding.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese army, which had previously advanced to Tongubazar, dispatched an advance team to Nagenngen to cut off the automobile road from Maungdaw to Chittagong, making it impossible for the enemy to supply the rear and preventing the remnants of the enemy from escaping. On the 9th, a powerful new mobile unit of the Japanese army that advanced towards Tongubazar cut off the aforementioned automobile road in the area between Maungdaw and Nagenngen, making the encirclement line even tighter.</p>
<p>As a result, the Japanese army's encirclement attack became more and more fierce, and the battle progressed more and more surely and rapidly. Since the beginning of this battle, the Free Indian National Army, which has been cooperating closely with the Japanese army and fighting bravely, has been increasingly encouraged in the battle to annihilate the enemy British Indian army, and has achieved remarkable results in various places. At present, the Japanese army's attack is continuing to achieve remarkable results in the battle to annihilate the enemy's 7th Division, while the enemy's 5th Division is also in the shape of a kangaroo under the Japanese army's encirclement ring (Xiang, translated from the Asahi Shimbun on February 12th).</p>

<h3>Strict Investigation of Gold Speculators in Progress</h3>

If any criminal offenses are found, they will still be detained for investigation. Their names will also be publicly announced to serve as a warning and maintain discipline, eradicate speculation, suppress prices, and maintain people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Thrift Association Launches "Punctuality Movement"; Hopes Public Will Practice Thrift of Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association is sparing no effort in promoting the thrift movement. Recently, the association actively promoted its work by organizing regular broadcasts to encourage the public to practice thrift and complete the wartime system. The reporter specially visited the association yesterday to inquire about various issues related to thrift. The official released a statement on the "Punctuality Movement" as follows:</p>
<p>In recent years, the practice of saving time has become more and more frequent in modern society, and it is necessary to pay attention to the value of time. People in society who have more careers often have several gatherings and banquets in one day. Often, because one or two people fail to pay attention to time and arrive late, the scheduled time is extended, and those who arrive on time sit and wait, wasting precious time. Gatherings and banquets are a public matter, and should not be hindered by a small number of people who are occasionally late, hindering the majority. Therefore, the punctuality movement is a necessity in modern social interaction. It is hoped that people in society will pay extra attention to punctuality. If they cannot attend a gathering or banquet, or cannot arrive on time, it is best to declare in advance, or if they must arrive on time, they must pay attention to the distance of the route and calculate the time of the route, and act in advance. Then, over time, it will become a habit, and it will be of great benefit to both private and public undertakings.</p>

<h3>U.S. Attempts to Turn China into a Battlefield; Statement by Matsushima, Head of the Press Department</h3>
<p>Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, met with Chinese reporters yesterday and made the following statement regarding the recent war situation:</p>
<p>Attempting to Turn China into a Battlefield</p>
<p>Today, I will try to explain the following issues: Regarding the recent situation, I especially hope you pay attention to the increasing lack of manpower resources in the United States. On the 16th of this month, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz announced the shift from the Marshall Islands to Truk, entering the Chinese mainland, utilizing Chinese military strength, and engaging in a final battle with Japan. This American plan is completely contrary to Japan's new policy. Japan, through the implementation of its new policy, is gradually giving China new life—that is, peace. The reason why the Chinese people are enduring all the difficulties now is because they firmly believe that peace will surely be realized in the future. For example, last winter, there were no water heaters or stoves everywhere, but they believed that in the next year or two, they would surely have a warm life. But when the United States approaches China, it wants to turn China into a battlefield of blood. At that time, I vehemently opposed Nimitz's remarks. No matter what sacrifices Japan makes, it will definitely repel the American troops who cross the sea to attack China.</p>
<p>Attempting to Reopen the Burma Road</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has attempted to open the "Ledo Road" from Burma into the Chinese mainland. In short, this is entirely because the United Kingdom and the United States lack human resources and want to use the Chinese people and sacrifice the Chinese people to win their final victory.</p>
<p>What I especially want to tell the people of Chongqing is that when you bring the United Kingdom and the United States into the Chinese mainland, you will absolutely not achieve victory. This will only turn China into a miserable battlefield. Recently, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of college students to participate in the war, but these personnel are of little help to the Pacific War. In the end, the United States' ultimate attempt is still to use the Chinese people for a final battle.</p>
<p>Regarding my opposition, US Secretary of the Navy Knox stated on the 23rd, "The US military has no intention of entering the Chinese mainland." This is clearly a sophistry. The fact that the highest authority of the US Navy, Nimitz, and Knox expressed such contradictory opinions shows that the result is a deceptive and concealing act. Nimitz's plan is to go through the Marshall Islands, Truk, the Philippines, and enter China, using China as the final battlefield to fight, attacking Japan. Another route is to enter China from Burma via the Ledo Road. Some people in Chongqing are also very interested in this, but if the United States really enters China and uses China as a battlefield, China will absolutely not be happy. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Repelling the US Military in the Pacific</p>
<p>Recently, key figures in the US leadership have stated that the most important battlefield is Shanghai. Therefore, today, Japan is working hard to repel the US military in the Pacific, which is also to prevent China from turning into a miserable battlefield. This is what I want you to pay special attention to. If the United States' attempt is realized, some people in the Chongqing government may feel happy, but all the Chinese people will have to sacrifice. Therefore, Knox hastily canceled what Nimitz had announced, and that is the reason.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the recent changes in the Japanese command, an American journalist, who had lived in Tokyo for a long time and was quite familiar with the situation in Japan, spread the following rumors: During this command change, the former Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff were both ordered to commit suicide. This is a huge joke. Japan has previously announced changes in the command to ensure consistency between political and military strategies. The two retired chiefs have now been appointed as the most important military advisors.</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Brutality of British and American Troops</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the brutality of the British and American troops, let me explain: The most pitiful news recently is that Mrs. Gandhi died in prison at the age of seventy-four. This is not only the grief of the 340 million people of India but also the grief of the one billion people of East Asia. This is the same as the US sinking of the troop carrier and lighthouse monitoring ship "Lishun."</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress Party was preparing to publish a memorial article for Mrs. Gandhi's death, but the Governor-General forcibly suppressed it, preventing its publication, which caused all the members of the National Congress Party to withdraw from the parliament.</p>
<p>After a long period of prison life, and dying in prison, even a memorial article is not allowed to be published after death. This is truly a blood and tears history of all East Asian nations.</p>
<p>At the same time, related to this matter, I hope everyone pays attention to the fact that when Chongqing dispatched Xiong Shihui, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Yongchang, and others to Burma and India to inspect the Chongqing army, they pointed out the recent chaos in the command system and also mentioned the strong sentiment among Indian soldiers to defect to the Japanese army. This is nothing more than the anger of the Indian army over the sympathy for Gandhi and his wife.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Liushun" mentioned earlier, the Chinese people floating on the water were all machine-gunned to death by American planes, including pitiful mothers holding children, who were also shot to death. You probably haven't forgotten this, right?</p>
<p>Similar to this series of cruel acts, in the Italian front, the Dutch front, and when bombing Belgium, it was the same. They even bombed churches blindly, and countless priests were tragically killed.</p>
<p>Actually Advocating the Use of Poison Gas</p>
<p>Recently, influential newspapers in Washington have been constantly urging the government to use poison gas in the Pacific War. According to their intention, poison gas should also be used on the Chinese front. Therefore, this is not only a problem for the Japanese army, but also very important for China. At the same time, the Japanese army's withdrawal of troops in the Pacific is also to save China from the threat of poison gas. Looking at today's situation from this perspective, we also hope that Japan will be victorious. The reason is that if the United Kingdom and the United States enter China from the Pacific or Burma and turn it into a battlefield, not only will the Chinese people be sacrificed, but even the families of important figures in Chongqing would not want the United Kingdom and the United States to ravage them. Therefore, the idea of ​​introducing the United Kingdom and the United States into China, using China as a base to attack Japan, is completely wrong. At the same time, China must be sacrificed before attacking Japan. This is also what you must pay special attention to. Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Be True to the Name?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that there is a shortage of materials today because some people are hoarding materials, and prices are soaring because some people are manipulating prices. As for who is hoarding and who is manipulating, everyone may not know all of them, and even those who know only feel angry but dare not speak out. Due to such an environment, the price problem of a wartime country has been driven to a dead end. Isn't it painful to say?</p>
<p>We should have discussed the necessary awareness under a controlled economy, which is to "share the blessings" and "everyone eats," instead of taking "fully satisfying one's own desires" as the premise. The reason why a controlled economy meets the needs of the times is precisely because of this principle, which is utilitarianism in economics; the so-called utilitarianism lies in increasing the total amount of human happiness: suppressing the happiness of a few people or a part of the people can increase the happiness of the entire people, and its suppression is what the times need; If it can make all the people happy, it is even more necessary to enforce its suppression. This is the point where the controlled economy is suitable for the principles of economics, and it is what our government and people should thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>However, once a controlled economy is implemented, it must be true to its name, otherwise, its results will inevitably be worse than the anarchic state of a free economy, and the suffering of the people will inevitably fall into deeper and deeper waters. In view of the recent strengthening of the Materials Investigation Committee's plan and the tension of its work, we feel that since it is a materials investigation, then considering the meaning of each, the scope of the investigation should be expanded for the source of hoarding and manipulating materials today, and the steps of the investigation should be strengthened. We believe that the recent resolute implementation of the crackdown on hoarding speculation and private price increases in the two cities of Tianjin and Beijing, in addition to shops, also includes inspections of private residences, which is indeed a method of "cutting the Gordian knot with a sharp knife," which can be used for us to learn from.</p>
<h3>Authorities Discuss Countermeasures for Long-Term Stability of Prices; Hope Citizens Report to Facilitate Dispatch of Personnel for Investigation</h3>
<p>The entire price problem in this city has been under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, and it has been able to achieve some results, but hoarding and speculation have not been eliminated, which has seriously harmed the stability of industry and commerce. According to reporters' inquiries from all parties yesterday, the authorities have discussed better countermeasures for the long-term stability of prices in the management of industry and commerce, and decided to gradually implement them following the established policy, but hope that citizens will give unanimous assistance. Anyone who knows one of the following situations must immediately send a letter to the nearby police station, or the economic bureau, food bureau, and the economic offices of various district offices to report, but must state the address and name of the business, the nature of the violation, etc., so that personnel can be dispatched immediately to secretly investigate the address. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances, "fines, or suspension of business, and revocation of business licenses," and prosecution in court and other punishments.</p>
<p>The regulations are recorded on the left: Hoarding a large number of materials, illegally engaging in buying and selling in an attempt to disrupt the market, secretly raising selling prices to consumers, operating improper commodities, reducing quality and quantity, using substandard weights and measures, privately transporting major controlled goods, deliberately stopping business in an attempt to illegally hoard, non-merchants operating the goods, or setting up characters, wholesalers do not wholesale existing goods, and middlemen do not sell existing goods to legitimate users within the limit, etc.</p>
<h3>Members of Industry Associations Must Be Industry Merchants</h3>
<p>The competent authorities in this city, in view of the establishment of various industry associations, although they have been rectified, it is inevitable that some may not conform to the wartime economic system. According to reporters' inquiries yesterday, the current authorities are aware of this and will make appropriate adjustments. The establishment of any industry association must conform to the wartime economic system. The members of the association should be merchants who operate the goods of the industry and have formal business numbers. Such as industry brokers, or industry transporters, shall not be regarded as members of the same industry. If there is a distinction between retail and wholesale, each must be clearly distinguished and separate associations must be established so that each industry can have a home. Anyone who has one of the above situations, the authorities will order them to stop their activities. It was learned yesterday that the authorities recently realized that a small number of associations, their leaders and some members, are not legitimate merchants in the industry, but are industry brokers or carriers, which has led to accusations from legitimate merchants in the industry. However, the authorities decided to handle it fairly, which can not only avoid disputes but also benefit the industry. Hua Stock Market</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sea Turtle (8)</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour before going to bed that night, the dormitory of the student hall was really noisy. Student No. 1 was on his last leave and would soon be going to the turbulent Pacific Ocean, while Student No. 4, wearing a pure white second-class uniform and a short sword around his waist, was returning to his hometown for the first time, so his heart was pounding and his voice stirred up a vortex.</p>
<p>After the first night patrol, the lights were dimmed, but no one could fall asleep.</p>
<p>(Once I return to my hometown, I will immediately go to the Togo cemetery to pay my respects...) So he thought.</p>
<p>(If my mother sees me like this, she will definitely be surprised:) He thought like this again.</p>
<p>(I must show my blackness to Junlongfu...)</p>
<p>Wearing such an imposing military uniform, my mother would definitely like it, but Junlongfu seemed very embarrassed. The body, which had turned black from gun training and swimming under the hot sun, not only gave satisfaction but also hoped to show it to the teachers.</p>
<p>Zhenren smiled happily in his heart. Compared to himself four months ago, he felt twelve points of satisfaction in his heart. He was no longer a "worldly" person. He was trained and had a definite future - he was already envisioning the brave attitude of stepping out of the school gate tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>On the Naval Academy (1)</p>
<p>The author uses the time when Taniguchi is away to make a simple impression and discussion of the Naval Academy. To be honest, the author's plan was to describe Zhenren's Etajima life to introduce the whole picture of the military school, but he finally felt that this was far from being able to capture it. Because the organization of the military school is so huge and complex, and the content is extremely profound and special. To express it in the form of a novel, even writing a hundred chapters would probably not be enough. Therefore, we have to adopt such a simple method.</p>
<p>Originally, to officially visit this school, it should always be from the sea. The main gate of the school faces the sea, but it is a gate without a door, only a pier and a wooden fence. People who are truly qualified to visit this school must take a naval warship and enter through the main gate. Needless to say, the author can only use a public bus and enter through the back door opposite the bank, so there is really no qualification to talk about feelings and arguments. The Naval Academy is such a solemn existence that it does not allow ordinary people to peep.</p>
<p>In short, from the back door to the school, there are vermilion and white student halls, a large green lawn, and a distant view of the mountains of Nomi Island through the old pine trees - first of all, we must marvel at the beauty of the environment. At the same time, we must be amazed by the clean environment that is free of dust. Then we are surprised that there are no leisurely people coming and going. We are surprised that the students wearing white work clothes use their pure and innocent demeanor to perform orderly and disciplined actions. At that time, everyone should feel like they have discovered something here, giving people the illusion of hearing bells from a distance. Disciplined, natural, and transcendent existence - the environment and people, everything, gives people the impression of entering the Snow Strust Monastery (founded in Naumann, Torava in 1660).</p>
<p>However, we will soon realize that this is just the feeling of people who enter through the back door. Although there is faith here, there is no belief. Moreover, students do not need to imitate that religious love and dedication, they are already soldiers. The body is no longer their own. For them, there is no so-called straying and enlightenment, only a certain belief, and it can be polished.</p>
<p>However, that method also has places like asceticism and bitterness. That is the ascent of Mount Misen in Miyajima and the holding of the general boat. The former is a five-mile-long stone staircase, and you must run to the top of the mountain in one breath. No matter how strong you are, it is difficult to walk unsteadily in the middle. However, for the sake of the squadron's honor, even those who fall must be picked up to the finish line. The same is true for the total short boat. In the cold winter, at the command, you have to put the short ship of the city down by yourself and shake it to a two-kilometer point by yourself, and at the same time, you have to return to the original position. This is also a tearful ascetic practice. It is said that in the era when Lieutenant Commander Hirose was studying, the ascent of Mount Misen and the general short ship were held together.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Borrowing Rice Debt and Donating Rice Association</h3>
<p>— Fukuhara</p>
<p>I feel that most of the hidden poor in today's society were not lazy people in the past. Because they are not good at coping with the environment, although they had some savings in the past, they have all become difficult to survive under the control of the environment. Want to borrow money from relatives and friends? Although banknotes are worthless, no one wants to lend banknotes to others, unless they have a hundred points of affection, they can borrow it, which is understandable. Lenders do not want to suffer this loss because prices rise every day and are high every moment. Therefore, I think this borrowing rice price and donating rice association may be worth providing to people in the community for common research.</p>
<p>The so-called borrowing rice price is that person A borrows cash from person B, and the amount is converted into the rice price on the day, that is, the black market official price. If the borrowed amount is 1,000 yuan, and the rice price on the day is 3,300 yuan, it can be stated on the IOU that 3 dou of rice are borrowed, and the monthly interest is a certain amount, then the rice price will be converted into cash at maturity. If each stone rises to 4,000 yuan and the monthly interest is 2%, then pay a monthly interest of 80 yuan. Everything else can be based on the procedures before the war. When returning, if the rice price falls, it must also be based on the rice price.</p>
<p>The method of donating rice association can also be handled in the same way as the association of donating and collecting, which is also converted into the black market rice value on the day, and the association fee and association interest are also converted into the market value on the day, so that both parties are not affected by the ups and downs of the currency value. This is an economic problem of a whole plan. Or it may be able to reduce the rising nature of prices because in this way, the currency can also have more outlets, and moreover, the lender can earn its profits every month. No matter how the situation changes, rice is the most important element of life, and the ups and downs of prices cannot be separated from this issue. I only provide this personal view for everyone to discuss.</p>

<p>A Poor Scholar's Plea</p>
<p>Lost Property: I am a poor scholar, earning my living by teaching and writing. I never wear fancy clothes, never suffer indignities. Contentment is my constant glory, and I seek a simple life. I do not covet wealth, power, or authority, and I abstain from smoking, drinking, gambling, and prostitution. Alas, I was not born at the right time. Prices are soaring, and people struggle to survive. The winds are sharp as knives, and the cold is like a long, dark night. My only remaining bedding has been stolen by a friend. The cold night is unbearable, and I am helpless. I implore all those kind-hearted gentlemen, please speak out on my behalf, seeking unused clothing and bedding, and send them to this address for delivery. (Yao Jisheng)</p>
