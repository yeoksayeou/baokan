<p>社評</p>
<h3>存米登記母存觀望</h3>
<p>關於戶口米恢復配給一事，根據連日報載消息，主管部分正在積極義辦，諒最短期間即可實現。相信大部分市民正密切注意這問題，尤其是家無隔宿之糧的貧苦階層更感迫切　不過另一個問題，其性質也是非常重要，尤其是中上階層的市民更應特別注意的，就是本市物品配給處佈告存米登記。</p>
<p>本月四日物品配給處佈告，凡在本市區內截至八月五日止，如藏有規定數量以外之存米者，應於八月十日午前至該處第一科申請登記。所謂「規定數量」，　米店，商號，工廠，娛樂塲，其他各種團體，藏有十二石五斗以上之存米者。　市民家庭藏有每人超過六斗以上之存米者。該佈告並表示，舉辦登記之目的，為求明瞭本市米糧之存量，決無沒收或强制收買之意。但在指定期內，抗不申請登記或作虛偽之登認者，一經查獲，定予沒收。</p>
<p>根據佈告所示，當局已經明白表示存米登記之目的，而並無沒收或强制收買之意。所以，市民所有存米超過規定數量者，均應從速遵照期限申請登記，切勿稍存觀望，錯過登記時間。登記時並須絕對忠實，切勿隱瞞虛偽　因爲遵照規定登記以後，決無沒收或强制收買的損失，這是當局的功令，為維持成信，絕對不會欺騙市民的。反之，如果市民藏有規定數量以外的存米，而隱瞞不請登記，或雖登記而虛偽不實，這是遠反功令，一旦查出，則當局為維持威信，必將沒收。這時市民的損失，是咎由自取，無可諉避的。登記日期截至八月十日午前即止，時閒迫促，萬勿猶豫觀望，後悔莫及。</p>
<p>進一步言，存米登記的目的，為求明瞭本市米糧之存量。更澈底的說，是對付奸商國積，根本消滅壟斷居奇，波動米價的因素。過去市民或為防免高價而積榖逾量，就須忠實登記，因為執有登記憑證以後，就是取得存米合法的身份，獲得保障。如果存米以國積居奇為目的，虛心隱瞞或以多報少，則查出沒收，罪有應得。如因恐慌而出範，則米價四平，亦勝與大眾有利。</p>
<p>其次，我們從各方面觀察，在此靑黃不接之際，當局恢復戶口米配給，巳有確實充分的把握，不致延期，不致滅量，依照每人每旬兩升米外，對於麵粉與雜糧配給，並再增加數量，以期逐漸達到配給與消耗量相等。這是市民所切望，也是當局所努力設法的。</p>
<p>最後，我們所不能已於言者，據聞警察，公務人員，產業工人等除普通配給以外，並有特種配給，我們對此待遇菲薄而責任綦重者，享受特種配給，不勝同情。惟服務教育事業的教職員，也是待遇菲薄而責任甚重，應與上列人員享受同等待遇。所以，我們主張公私立大中小學教職員也有特種配給。希望教育當局與配給處當局從速計議，以期實現。</p>
<h3>小笠原東方海面　日機炸沉美巡艦　襲父島敵機擊落四十餘架</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日本大本營八月六日下午四時發表，八月四日上午，敵機動部隊出現於小笠原羣島東方海而，四·五兩日空裂父島，五日敵以巡注艦，驅逐艦數艘砲擊父島，日軍所在部隊予以邀擊，擊落敵機四十一架以上，擊毀巡洋艦一艘，將其擊退，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　敵美為呼應大宮島品及迭尼安兩島之登陸作戰，四日上午復以機動部隊進攻小笠原羣島東方海面，四·五兩日空襲父島及硫黃島，五日更以巡洋艦，驅逐艦數艘砲擊父島，七月三日·四兩日，進攻小笠原羣島，此次距前次來襲為時約一月，日軍守備隊不屈不撓，勇猛奪戰，堅持必勝信念，屢次給予敵軍重創，茲誌戰况詳情如下；　硫黃島四日敵機空襲三次，第一次來廢敵機七十七架被擊落十三架，第二次七十架中被擊落十二架，第三次五十架中被落三架，共計擊落敵機二十八架。五日敵B24型三架，分兩次來襲，第一次一架，第二次兩架。　父島四日敵機二十二架來襲，被擊落三架，五日復以大型機及B24型機達四百餘架來襲，被擊落十架，兩日共擊洛敵機十三架，五日敵大型機一架，出現父島上空，當即被日軍猛烈砲火擊落，五日敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦數艘曾砲擊父島。　小笠原羣島四日敵機出現於小笠原羣島海面，襲擊日艦二次，第一次來襲敵機計五十架，第二次來襲敵機五十餘架，日空軍於五日空襲敵機動部隊，炸沉敵巡洋艦一艘，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地電，大富島日軍之一部，自七月二十一以來，於明石街東北方之春田山西方一帶構築陣地，迎擊有戰車大砲飛機擁護之敵軍，展開激烈之白刃戰，予以甚大損害，目下該方面之日軍逐次向北方移動，刻正以平塚街之三叉路口為中心，展開激戰。</p>
<h3>日軍在孟加拉灣　已完成鐵壁防綫　安達曼各島展開空中戰</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　安達曼·尼科巴兩孤島，位於印度洋最前綫，是防衛大東亞資源地帶的戰略綫，目為掌握孟加拉灣制海制空之</p>
<p>一大要塞　綫。其地勢係由緬甸南端至蘇門答臘北端，蜿蜓一千七百公里，連結殘缺不全的二百數十餘小島，各島嶼均不足一千平方公里，南安達曼島首都布雷亞港，經數度開發，始有今日之城市，除大尼科巴島外，其他小島均爲密厚的森林，可能建設簡單陸上基地之處極少，在此種地理條件下，與其他各要塞比較之，在易守的觀念上，却持有近代建塞綫之特殊性質。而今就敵軍反攻之情形推測之，南安達曼之布雷亞港至錫蘭島，距約二千里，距加爾各答約二千公里，就敵艦船部隊之時速二十五哩計算，則恰巧一日可達，因此在廣大之孟加拉灣海面，日軍正急於形成鐵似之防壁，以一</p>
<p>作海空軍　活躍之根據地。敵軍即使能在該島中之任何小島內登陸成功，但由於前述之地理條件，頗難在該島設置空軍基地，若進攻其他島嶼更屬難事，若欲企圖進襲，無異百段羅綱，徒爲日海空軍之餌食。今在孟加拉灣附近，正反覆展開轟炸戰與偵察戰，敵曾試行偵察或轟炸安達曼及尼科巴，日軍一則反覆轟炸加爾各答。馬德拉斯及可倫河各地，於印度洋戰機成熱時，海上近代要塞綫之孟加拉灣，誇為最堅固之基地，然不久當可成為日軍攻取印度之根據地。印度洋氣候年從五月至十一元爲雨季，十二月間至五月間爲乾季，安達曼。尼科巴內列島</p>
<p>印度洋中　部，純係印度洋之海洋氣候，甚為快適，乾季雨季時之氣溫，正午最熱，但並不似大陸性之悶熱，夜間凉爽異常，睡時僅需毛曁一床足矣，乾季幾乎無雨，在印度洋海水如油，天氣無大變化，但一至雨季，降雨終日，不足爲奇，且印度洋海潮甚大，濁浪排空，對於戰及艦船之機動戰，大有妨碍。安達曼居民總數約十二萬，其中大部為印度人，計約十一萬八千，緬甸人僅佔二千，因該地曾為受刑移民地，住民多為受刑者及受刑者之子孫，男子較多，約當三與一之比，居民過去在英人支配下，受盡種種刑犯殖民地生活，復因被英人之自由主義個人主義思想之融蝕，失去本來性格，故缺少保甲相助之共同精神。該地素為東亞</p>
<p>最大刑所　前被監禁之印度獨立運動同志，在昭和十七年（民國三十一年）三月，日軍進駐一週以前，均被英軍送回印度本土，居民無知，不甚關心印度之獨立問題。日軍進駐後，軍政當局對此等純正居民之猶太思想，盡力推行王道思想，在軍政當局指導下，組織印度獨立聯盟安達曼支部，該支部其後經數度改組擴充下，十八年十二月已創設印度獨立之義勇軍，其發展至為神速。在此情况下，十二萬居民逐漸掃除盎格營撒克遜之利益思想。努力於</p>
<p>印度獨立　運動，擔當大東亞之一員，與日軍協力共同作戰。</p>
<h3>雷州半島　日軍北進</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社一電　據重慶來電，輸軍當局於六日發表戰况公報稱，日軍於廣東省雷州半島之攻勢情形如次，日軍於廣東省西部雷州半島之遂溪附近，派遣大批增援部隊，其後三日正午對渝軍各陣地，於航空隊掩護下開始攻擊，其另一隊沿遝溪公路北上，向逐溪北方三十公里之石城（廉江）進發，第一錢戰鬥刻正展開中。</p>
<h3>陸空一體協力下　日軍總攻衡陽　渝軍遭擊損失奇重</h3>
<p>湖南前綫七日中央社電　日軍在陸空一體之協力下，四日夕刻開始總攻衡陽。五日下午七時，日第一綫部隊業已肉搏戰，自衡陽南方地區，向敵軍最强陣地之南方軍公路北側地區前進，向次要南地區猛攻之日軍，奪取杏花村南側高地，及西禪寺西方高地。五日拂曉，在衡陽西方銅錢渡及雲母山猛擊，將敵方七十九軍一師完全殲滅，敵為轉移日猛烈之進攻，擬攻擊日軍攻略部隊之北側，目下陸續向衡陽之周邊增派援兵，然亦遭日軍邀擊，損失甚重。渝蔣軍為死守衡陽，除在地上激戰之外，復發動在渝空軍之主力，於衡陽上空與日軍機隊血戰中。</p>
<p>日軍夜襲　奪取陣地</p>
<p>中國日軍前終某基地七日中央社電　自四日傍晚日軍開始總攻擊後，衡陽城內二萬餘渝軍，已危在旦夕。茲將誇稱堅强之衡陽渝軍陣地解剖如次：衡陽城廓東方之湘江及北方之蒸水，切斷西方及南方地區，環　無數沼澤與丘陵，於此天然地形上築有堡壘陣地甚多，形成完畢之火網，日軍精銳部隊為奪取該陳地，利用夜襲，畫間冒渝軍砲火，首先佔領渝軍主要陣地之正面哨滅陣地，更將渝軍利用江沼園繞之竹壁木柵，全行破壞，繼續前進深入數米之阻絕壕，　此種戰壕之上部可投擲手榴彈，同時置有機關槍等，基側防火器之效果頗多。倘以梯子攀登直上，則有遭機關槍猛射之危險，若將比陣地突破後，則有高達數米斷產，即以山砲攻擊亦頗難破壞，攀登斷崖上則到處有機關槍陣地，越此而上，則有交通壕，再行前進則有砲兵陣地。其背後　有陷井頗多，越過陷奔乃至主壘，其中裝有棧槍，內理地雷，此種複廓陣地，利用有效防火器，各陣地間連絡便利，形成完　之火網。</p>
<p>衡陽陷落　迫在眉睫</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　路透社組重慶訪員，六日承認日軍總攻衡陽，謂該市之陷落，迫在眉睫。據稱日軍已開始對衡陽發動總攻，該巾之命運，將於二十四小時內決定。日軍曾於四日徹夜砲轟城內後，復於五日派遣飛機出動轟炸，日步兵隊亦曾强襲渝軍各陣地後，即將各陣地佔領，另一隊日軍則已突破市街西南部之渝軍守備綫云。</p>
<p>中國大陸　日美決戰　　湖南日軍前淺六日中央社電衡陽總攻擊，亦即中國大陸之日美決戰，業於四日傍晚，空陸同時啓幕。四日下午五時，日第一綫航空部隊相綱以肉彈突擊，自衡陽南方進抵渝軍最後陣地南方軍公路地區，開始猛進之日強襲部隊，業已奪取杏花村南側高地，西禪寺西方高地。另一日軍，五日拂曉於衡陽西方銅錢渡及雲母山圍攻渝第七九軍之一團，完全予以殲滅，現正繼續攻擊中。渝軍刻陸積以大軍向衡陽周過增援，然過日軍之邀擊，受創甚鉅。</p>
<p>日軍完全　佔領廉江</p>
<p>日軍前綫其基地七日中央社電日華南派遣軍，為澈底殲滅盤踞雷州半島北部，途溪東北方之渝軍第七戰區第一百五十五師第四百六卜三團，第四百六十四團，及四百六十五團，曾於八月一日晨，藉空軍之協力，開始行動。並十四日上午九時，佔領馬頭嶺渝軍陣地。其後更突入渝軍据點廉江，而於四日下午二時，將盤踞市內頑抗之渝軍約八百人消滅，乃於是夜十二時三十分，完全佔領該市。是役所獲戰果，計渝軍遺屍五八○具，俘虜渝軍四一人，並截獲渝軍重機槍四挺輕機槍八挺，步槍一五○枝，手溜彈約一千顆，暨其他軍器彈藥甚夥云。</p>
<h3>日首相捧讀　宣戰大詔　今晨廣播披瀝決意</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電日小磯首相以本月八日為組閣以來之第一次大詔奉戴日，意義至為深長，特豫定八日六時半捧讀宣戰大昭，並以「謹奉大詔」為題，舉行廣播，精以披瀾政府完逐戰爭之決意。</p>
<h3>國內各地　　日軍戰况</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　六日中國各地日軍戰况如次：　湖南方面日軍，刻正擊襲集結於衡陽周圍之渝軍十師，四日薄暮，已開始進攻衡陽，目前衡陽方面，渝第十軍軍畏所部三四師，依然繼續被圍，故渝第六十二。七十叫·七十九·一百三十七·等五軍約十師左右，為救援起見，仍在衡陽企圖反攻，以衝開日軍之包圍，然亳未奏效。同時，日軍於四日黃昏起，動員空陸兩軍開始總攻衡陽，愉第五十八七十二兩軍，又於湘江側地區蠢動，日軍則施以反攻，嗣日軍佔領蓮花後，即向南方繼續追擊渝軍殘部，又日軍於茶陵，擊潰第二十四·十四·三十七·各軍殘部，更繼續南進，並重創渝軍七師。　華南方面，雷州半島日軍，以渝軍在廉江附近構築陣地，企圖蠢動，乃於三日對之加以攻擊。　空軍，駐渝美空軍遭日軍數次進攻後，雖受重創依然執拗抵抗，連日渝美機出動已達百架。又自七月二十八日夜起，至八月三日止，日樣曾轟炸桂林·柳州·芷江·丹竹·　州等地，計炸毀渝機二百五十六架云。</p>

<h3>美機襲柏林　擊落卅七架</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國社訊：美機羣昨製英堡柏林，被擊落卅七架，當時曾發生激烈空戰。</p>
<h3>華沙攻防戰　蘇軍損失重大　北路德軍奪回米托城</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國社訊：蘇軍坦克車第三隊在華沙以東遭遇敗績時，德軍擊毀敵重坦克車一百八十九輛，此外蘇軍損失戰俘三千人，戰死者約六千人。蘇軍雖繼續向韃靼山隘施加壓力，但德軍在喀爾巴阡山麓之其他各處進行順利之攻防戰，維斯都拉河上游之西，蘇軍曾集中精銳之坦克車四隊，蘇軍斥堠隊曾進至華沙東北之地區，但各該處即為德軍所阻。蘇軍在維斯社拉河前綫，迭次企圖擴大其在華沙東北之橋頭堡，但皆未得逞，華沙之南，德坦克車一隊曾冒敵軍之頑抗而進攻甚有進展，華沙以東德軍之防　戰亦獲重大之成功。奧洛斯托夫以東蘇瓦爾基東北及維爾科維希根以西等地區，蘇軍仍續施强大之壓力，但經數小時之激戰後，德軍之主要陣綫仍屹然不動。在默麥爾北面地區，蘇軍出其全力以圖向東普魯士邊境强行突破，經數小時之劇戰後，曾將德軍之陣綫壓後數公里，但並未能突破德軍之陣綫，東綫北段米托地區之德軍亦獲成功，米托城已自蘇軍手中奪回。庇普斯湖西南德軍在廣闊之戰綫上，將陣地後移，蘇軍緊迫避　之德軍，但遭擊退。</p>
<h3>泰晤士河英艦　中流星彈　倫敦疏散居民</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　倫敦來電稱：德軍流星彈於五日夜績向倫敦及英格蘭南部各地飛來，致損害及死傷者甚眾，一彈命中泰晤士河中之艦船，死傷頗衆。</p>

<h3>威尼斯皇宮　有被炸之虞</h3>
<p>威尼斯七日中央社電　海通社訊：威尼斯大運河畔之壯麗皇宮，有被敵機轟炸之虞，該城之大部份房屋已有裂痕，因該城房屋之基礎建築於礁湖鬆土之上，易受震動，故該城汽船駛行之速率，不得超過六英哩，以滅浪擊。敵機轟炸邁斯特里與馬格哈拉時，空氣壓力之重，使威尼斯若干房屋已受損害。該城之一部份華屋係外國人所有，如美國影星曼麗盛克福與美國巨富華爾伍斯之女繼承人胡頓，均有別墅建築於此，英外相艾登亦誕生於此，其誕生之屋現仍爲艾登家族所有。</p>
<h3>希特勒演說　堅持勝利信念　國社黨員對領袖矢忠</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：德國社黨訪員報告今午德國各區政治及黨領袖之集會情况稱：艾搏將軍爲德國社黨領袖之發言人，首先欣然致詞，謂七月二十日之暴行發動後，喜見元首健康及精力完全恢復，欣幸奚似。於是希特勒兀首向各區領袖致詞，討論此次暴行之背景。希特勒指陳，溯自國社黨秉政以還，此種叛徒即暗中阻撓國家奮鬥之雄圖，彼等人數雖少，勢力却不容忽視，且屢圖反抗政府採取之措施，大多數之軍隊與上述之叛徒無關，亦有惡之而分道揚鑣者。本人認為此次之暴行，揚露反抗之內幕，肅淸負責之叛徒，改善本人肩承之負擔，其亦命運使然歟。目前未屆遽下定論之時，將來世人或能了解此可恥之暴行，對德國前途反促成有利之結果焉。希特勒又稱：吾人與外敵作戰，余決不能退縮，無論如何吾人將痛擊之，但余認爲必須有絕對保安之情感，及後方忠誠合作之信念，此乃現決之條件。而今怠工之人業已消滅，否則今日我國人民全力動員之措施，不能完成矣。吾人運用全國之全部軍力與力量，將可克服一切困難。希特勒元首結論稱，天容余生存，俾得繼續作戰，余深感之，余信德國需要在任何情勢下決不屈服之人如余者，余信余將永久高舉忠信之旗焉。無論命運予余若十打擊，余將兀立不倚，自七月二十日至今，余獲得生平未有之信念，因此余將經歷此戰獲得最後之勝利焉。希特勒元首致詞後，所有蒞會之黨領袖或表示信任領袖，忠誠不渝。</p>
<h3>布列塔尼美軍　進抵拉伐爾　奧納西岸德縮短陣線</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國訊：北法敵軍作戰重心仍在西翼，在布列塔尼半島上美坦克車隊已攻入內地，因德守軍係集中於最重要地區，故並未有較大之作戰，另一美軍部隊，內有坦克車與摩托化步兵各數師團，由阿弗朗　迤南之突入區，向東與東南出擊，而於星期六傍晚時，抵達邁揚納（Mayenne）與拉伐爾（Laval在倫納西南）此處戰爭詳情尚不可得。英軍侵犯地區之進軍亦在兩翼，其壓力在普萊斯爾（Presles）之南特別强大，其突破企圖均為德擲彈兵所阻。昨日下午在克恩·法萊斯公路兩旁之蒂萊。佛田埃爾。與聖馬丁之北，發生活躍之戰爭，英軍經短促之砲火後，發動猛烈進攻，顯然希望西翼局勢之發展，迫使德軍司令部不得不减缩克恩戰區之德軍戰綫。奧納河東，加拿大軍經四日之靜止後，於星期日淸晨在佛里埃爾與蒂萊·拉卡巴果之間，以坦克車與步兵發動進攻，但被擊退。奧納河之西德軍之脫離行動，已照預定計劃告成，暫時被切斷聯絡之德軍部隊，已進至德軍陣綫。維爾河之西與波伊（Pois）附近，美軍在圯克車與摩托化車輛掩護下，經强大之砲隊準備後突破缺口數處但均已被堵合。</p>
<h3>日本新內閣的使命</h3>
<p>新閣的意義</p>
<p>新內閣成立的意義，第一，乃在整頓完逐大東亞戰爭之核心的陸海軍中指導者的陣容。即由於參謀總長，軍令部總長，陸軍大臣，海軍大臣四頭制的確立，傾注全力於統帥及軍政，以完遂大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>因塞班島的失陷而戰局面臨新　段後，統帥參劃與軍政輔弼各重求適宜人選，以更充實的內容，而大權歸一。此在前內閣時野村海相的現任，梅津參謀總長的親愛，而走上了新企劃的第一步。這計劃目有待於新內閣的成立來</p>
<p>新內閣成立的第二個意盡，乃在一新人心，結集國家總力。今後的戰局，預料將愈激烈。敵所呼號的空襲本土如果愈趨熾烈，則縱後方的婦孺亦不能不用自力來消减落下的彈藥。物資將愈用愈竭，在這困難與不足之中的全體國民，為要發揮其總力，樂於忍受，抱著滿懷希望而推進戰爭。則有待於指導者之人格的影響者不少。新內閣的第二國意義就在於此。小磯米內協力內閣之明朗而有抱容力的狀態，國民將不惜與以全面的信類。</p>
<p>新閣的性質</p>
<p>從上面看來·新內閣的性質自然明瞭。即第一，乃欲以更强化的陣容，向完遂大東亞戰爭而邁進的强力決戰內閣。第二，為了這完遂決戰的政治方式——即真正發揮國民總力，不能不以人和來使全體國民積極挺身以遂行戰爭</p>
<p>實現上述使命的內閣構成方式，第一，組閣大命降下於小磯，米丙兩大將，兩人同心提機，組成協力內閣。第二，太平洋決戰愈演愈烈時，使全海軍發揮真體的海軍魂米內大將復歸現役，擔任海相。</p>
<p>小磯大將的胆力與韜略，與米內大將之明朋闊達的開啓性格之强靱的結合，一般人均預料有俊嚴而溫順的最上戰爭者。</p>
<p>新內閣政策的基本動向</p>
<p>新內閣舉其政治，經濟的全力，以貢獻於決戰期的戰爭。因此，新內閣的施策，首先將向着國內決戰態勢之强化與生產之躍增。國民總蹶起的真義，即是各階級的國民以旺盛的戰意自動參與戰列。僅在數量上製造不堪使用的惡劣製品，那不是生產性的昂揚。新內閣的生產指導，應首先着眼於這基調，是照生產昂揚的第一步。</p>
<p>新閣的使命</p>
<p>新內閣是傾全力以推進戰爭的强力內閣。戰局現已迫近打倒英美反攻的時機。趁這反攻的時機，為使其最有效起見，傾國力的戰爭態勢是必耍的，因此，由强力內閣推進强力政策，為其第一使命。</p>
<p>遂行這强力政策的根本，先須培養人和。真正的總力戰中，要求每個國民的全力。這種大戰爭，非將全國人民置諸死地不能生。對國民開誠佈公，與國民互相聯絡，共同戰爭，為其第二使命。</p>
<p>取上述的態度時，政府可絕對信賴國民。又國民亦能有信賴政府的自信。如在這自信上，推行强力的政策，則可毫無摩擦，毫無障礙而順利地完成其目的。在道時候，對反對者有時可處以峻嚴，而如決戰非常措置等亦更可强化。為了生產性的昂揚，適應新事態的新生產樣式，可大胆採用。總之，以自信遂行大胆的强力政策，為其第三使命。</p>
<p>然戰局不會因新內閣的成立而立即好轉。政治者，究竟以國民各自的依養爲依歸。現在正是全體國民在正確的認識上，加深其樂於忍受未來因難的覺悟的時候。（翔：譯自七月二十三日朝日新聞）。</p>
<h3>東條內閣的回顧</h3>
<p>東條內閣在任二年九個月，組閣後不久即對英美開戰，故始終爲遂行戰爭的內閣。在此期間，東條首相所最注力者，為國務與統帥的密切化，及確立從總力戰立塲的舉國一致體制，大東亞的結集。</p>
<p>東條內閣誕生於昭和十六年（一九四一年）十月十八日，正是日美危機最緊張的時候。不滿二月即開戰，故此為東條內閣任內最大事件。政府與翼政會的關係，因阿部·東條之人的聯繫而成為表裹一體。在此期間，為刷新官界新體制而大量裁减官員。又隨着戰局的展開而有担任大東亞戰域外政的大東亞省之設置，且大東亞省成立後，東鄉外相隨即辭職，谷駐華大使就任外相，靑木國府經濟顧問就任大東亞相。</p>
<p>繼於昭和十八年四月，採納八十一屆議會中的空氣，改組內閣。安藤國務相任內相，山崎，大麻兩翼政會代表入閣，後藤翼贊會副總裁入閣，重光駐華大使任外相，谷外相，湯澤內相，井野農相退任。東條首相不單視察國內，且一遍訪大東亞共榮圈各國各地域，親自實地視察大東亞共榮圈的情形。對華政策之飛躍的發展，成立了中日基本條約，更於十八年秋，在東京召開為建設大東亞的大東亞會議。</p>
<p>但敵人的反攻愈演愈烈，戰局的酷烈更要求國內決戰體制的確立，東條內閣乃於十八年九月二十一日閣議上決定國政運營要綱，企圖樹立國內決戰體制。</p>
<p>擱置多年的軍需省卒告設立，商工省，企劃院決經撤廢。又與此有關的鐵道通信二省，改為運輸通信省，農林省改農商省。隨着這中央行政機精的改革，鈴木貞一國務相，寺島邊信省退職，岸商相以國務相為商工次官，東條首相自兼軍需相，藤原銀次郎氏為國務相。地方行政機構亦隨中央行政機構的改組而重行整頓，創設地方行政協議會，各縣知事就任各地行政協會長。於是向來不容易着手的行政機構，亦面目一新，內閣顧問制，行政查察制度亦於此期間實施，藤原國務相等屢次作行政查察，以資增進軍需生產。</p>
<p>至十九年二月，閣議更進而決定決議非常措置要綱，着手全國人民的戰鬥配置。學生動員大規模實施，不急不用事業迅加整理。國土防衛上，食糧增產上，軍需生產上，勞務動員上，凡可結集國家全力的施策，均次第實施。値得特別一提的是東條陸軍大將就任參謀總長，島田海軍大將就任軍令部總長。東條大將在先曾以首相兼陸相，軍需相，席不暇緩。更為謀國務與統帥的一元代而就任參謀總長。</p>
<p>然戰爭已發展至日本三千年來所未遇的嚴重局面，塞班島的日軍並同胞的苦戰，日趨激烈。自本年六月下旬起，閣議為反映戰局的深刻化，而加强戰局的嚴重性，根據由結集舉國總力以强力遂行戰爭的要求，乃有此次的總辭職。（翔：譯自七月二十一日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>讀者助學消息　友邦人士同情失學　法商電車公司捐助鉅款</h3>
<p>昨天開始評閱高中試卷，多數在水凖以上，尤其若幹卷特別優良。因此，我們深深地感到這樣天資聰穎，刻苦好學的青年，莫不是國家社會未來的中堅，如果爲了家境貧困而失學，豈非湮沒了大好人才，這是誰的損失，想到這裏，不禁惴惴然若有所失。現在幸得社會各界熱心出錢，督促我們推進助學運動，使我們所見的優秀青年，不致失學。不過，我們希望成績在水凖以上的清寒學生都能昇學，同時，我們相信也是社會熱心人士的共同希望。諸君出錢，我們出務，大家推進助學運動，誠不勝期待之至。</p>

<h3>敵美在渝將校　暴露蔑視態度　鬆平情報部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所主之報道　　，於昨（七）日下午二時半，　例假南京路外灘　懸策痁八樓舉行，會見本市中國新聞記者，鬆平情報部長准時偕同顧問　領事獲會，即席由鬆平部長　最近國際情勢，及本市經濟狀況，暢談基辭，歷時一小時半始畢。茲録鬆平部長談話如下：</p>
<p>善於敵美在渝將校之蔑視渝軍，引起渝方下級這；工　不平，頃有　　印派遺軍一下級軍官特從內地點出，歸誠和平，據彼所發表談話，對於敵美　蔑視渝軍，暢談美辭。由此足見敵症狀對東亞人之輕視，及對東亞所抱之態度，已不言可喻。查渝方派遣之駐印軍，在當初即　避免英美之蔑視，對一派遣之駐軍攷試相當嚴格，除　格測驗，須具有高大體格，五英呎六英吋以上，始有資格。其次對於教育程度，亦須　　於完全小學，然經嚴格攷試後之駐印軍，找印後仍遭受英美軍之不　輕視，恒不斷使渝軍攪作最困難之事，因此渝駐印軍之下級軍官校中，對英美軍之惡劣態度，日漸反對，而英美方面爲防止渝下級將校之不滿，曾向　內提出遣派英美將校，以直接指揮渝方軍隊，期免使與渝將校之　　，及不滿情形。晨此項提案中，特指出　祖國　　　，英美加拿大各方對此表示同意，惟渝方軍官將校，則反對激烈，而渝政權之意見，由美擔任師團長，以下部團長則由渝將校負責，該項原則，早經宋子文在　時予以承認，但蔣介石目見部屬將校黃埔生之反對，美人負責指揮，一面掩　宋子亠在美之承認，環境頓感　難，當初亦戰　反對，始於七月間，美將史蒂威爾之訪渝，與蔣大事商權，結果蔣表示讓步。因據最近所獲消息，此項國際師團，已從　　國境開赴第九戰區，　說矛盾之國際師團，在同床異夢下，將來定蹈覆轍，無良好結果。</p>

<h3>决戰食糧的確保</h3>
<p>大麻行政查罕使所主持之查察食糧行政，於七月八日至十日開始先就農商省，東京都及警視廳取大概情形。講座的問題，不應爲主要食糧，生鮮料品，並檢討加工儀器，嗜好品的供求關系，及關於工廠勞動者，學校，青少年，乳幼兒，妊産婦等食糧的供給情形，舉凡有關食糧的諸問題，莫不綱罷殆盡。下面試說明所提出的諸問題。</p>
<p>（一）食糧綜合配制的檢討</p>
<p>今日都市的食糧問題，蔬菜、魚、肉、蛋類及其他毀項儀器的供給量大爲減少。其負擔都集於主要食糧一種，於是有了問題。然而主要食糧的最低配給基凖量雖經決定，但其他生鮮食品的配給基凖尚未設定，如任其減少下去，各家庭乃發生不滿。</p>
<p>大概日本人繼續日常勞動，而要維持其體重，需要多少食物呢？迄今日止，各地的研究室從體熱的觀點，發表了許多報告，但政府本身，尚未加以科學的檢討，而獲得結倫。因而關於生鮮食料品的配給編制，亦漫無標凖，自雖期有負責的行政。</p>
<p>會議上曾指出這一點，而研究爲保持一般日本人工廠勞動者，青少年，任産婦等的體重，榮養起見，最低必須多少食糧，這是相當困難的問題。從令其大體的目標已經決定，但從今日的勞務，運輸，資材等諸條件看來，易腐爛　有困難。故不能不從醫學上，榮養學上所得的結論，參酌現實的供給糧，而獲得決定。高層所象聲詞者，祇要能夠供給米、蔬菜、魚、肉及其他一切食物，所以如能聲明絕對確保，就可以感到安定。因此，對於生鮮食料品，至少應與米麥等主要食糧同樣由國家管理。</p>
<p>（二）主要食糧的配給基凖</p>
<p>用某種方法，以修正現行的二合三勺的配給基凖，有無可能性的問題，亦爲檢討的題目之一。</p>
<p>現在的配給階段，分十數種，並有工廠特別配給，此時整理一切複雜的配給階段，使之更爲單純化，而將基凖量多少加以修正，這是第一個議論。修正基凖量的第二個議論是徹底剔除雙重配給及虛報人口。會議中曾有人提出，假使因徹查虛報人口而多出相當數量，　爲荒年之備。基凖量問題查察的結果，無論得出何種結論，政府必須指導國民，昂揚民衆長期忍苦，節省食糧以繼續戰爭的氣概。</p>
<p>（三）虛報人口的整理</p>
<p>虛報人口今日究有多少呢？有人以爲很多，但也有人以爲不很多。但整理之而使有餘剩則是必要的。從戰爭下的國民倫理說來，亦不容有此種情事。</p>
<p>虛報人口第一存在於事業場中的所謂飯堂。第二在工廠中，第三在配給機關，第四是職業各類的詐稱。調查的方法，本年二月十二日實施的國勢調查，自爲最大的根據。政府並調查同日全國配給米的實在人口，各府縣的虛報人口當然在這裏都算出來了。根據其結果，不會不立即實施根本的剔除虛報人口方策。</p>
<p>剔除虛報人口的方法，除實地調查外，別我他法。善於飯堂，可嚴查自由勞動者的移動，如有轉出，應予證明。工廠的虛報數，警視廳去年亦會作實地調查，查明有數萬的虛報數。自此以後，每三個方調查男女工員的實數，並加緊移動調查，長期缺席者的調查，虛報數於以漸減。但調查大工廠，管理工廠，實際上頗爲困難，官民應創設混合查察委員會，以任引責。善於配給機關，應確保配給員的生活，保證收入，一面更強化監督，訓練配給員的意識。這一點，食糧營團月面尚有應予改善的諸問題。</p>
<p>職業各類的詐稱，去年以來頗經修正。在東京都，每次高的記帳薄，配給人口即減數萬。這一點，希望各組長更加努力，時常調換記帳薄，一面並嚴密實施全國的轉出證明。但虛報人口數，有爲編制技術上所不免者，亦有非故意者。總之，民衆應深切認識食糧的實情與戰局，而受得本身所應得的配給，政府方面則不要減低生活上必要的最低配給，如此相輔而行，虛報人口問題庶能解決。</p>
<p>（四）未得勝的資源</p>
<p>我國尚未得勝食糧，究有多少，農商省正在研究中，「粃」自爲對象之一，他如芋蔓，芋葉，艾子，　　業等，擬使之粉含化。東北，北陸的山榮等已用　漬，蘋果的落果，脫脂大豆，　油纏等亦在研究中，以上用米換算起來，約有數十萬石。</p>
<p>（五）生鮮食料品</p>
<p>自本年三月起，對六大都市的蔬菜，魚類的集荷配給機構，漸加改革。</p>
<p>蔬菜自今年起各大消費都市均各謀自給，蔬菜生産報獎制，過剩生産的號漬等，都在講座之中，而關於蔬菜的運輸問題之確保，亦一致認爲最屬重要。</p>
<p>關於魚類，所講座者有對漁民停漁時的保障，設定未編制魚類的公價，價格的簡略化，強化近海漁業的編制，徹底對水産會社配給資材並監督生産實續等。</p>
<p>至於牛雙，現在鉰育數，反較事變前增加，故曾檢討屠殺相當數量以供蛋白質，牛的私屠則嚴加取締。</p>
<p>（六）生鮮食料品價格對策</p>
<p>現在的物價政策，最注意生活必需品，特別食糧中的重印食料品，這一點，許多人都主張價格政策應如何更發揮其機動性。</p>
<p>枯渴期價格的設定權委讓於地方自治體的問題，特別是東京市的市民，現在都想用較少的價值換得高價物。東京是擁有龐大人口的帝都，考慮這特殊性，可否以都內的集荷　上所需要的費用轉嫁於都下消費者的極限給與東京市，這意見頗堪注目。不過因市縣相互間的有關系，新物價與都發的生計費，消費量與價格的關系，消費量與低物價政策的關系，與米麥主要食糧價格的關系等，又價格政策本身今日其效果已大減，故從使大量提高生産者價格，政府的編制力亦不能滲透，這解見亦堪注目。</p>
<p>（七）外食券制度的檢討</p>
<p>扣除配給米實施全國共同外食券制度案，在滿洲已見之實施，可否移用於我國，頗多議論。</p>
<p>這是停止毋須外食券的一部份業務用食糧，而增配於家庭。這樣一來，現在外食券的所有者，免除了不能不與一般市民共在一般食堂外食的不便。在目前的食糧情況之下，實在廢止一般食堂，使都市的治安穩固。</p>
<p>（八）雜炊食堂</p>
<p>這也可說是現在治安的安全辦法。在東京市，雜炊食堂就食者各組合共計有四十五六萬，會議上曾講座組合出賣不夠規定的食品以漁利，而水洽市民感情，故主張完全廢止雜炊食堂，而改爲政府或自治體的公營食堂。</p>
<p>警戒警報下的休榮亦成問題，又薪水階級的中　，警戒警報下警備員的給食等，均須參酌外食券問題而另立新計劃。</p>
<p>（九）牛乳與酒</p>
<p>與乳幼兒的營養有關的牛乳問題，頗爲深刻，今後的方向，應將集荷機構，最末的配給機構使之營團化，各區的配給量，打破以前的實積主義，以實際人口比例爲基礎而加以調整。他如牛乳的需要者，應扣除其米的配給之提案，酒與別的嗜好品選擇配給量的提案，均經討論。不過菓子與酒不同，菓子以幼兒，任婦爲單位，酒以家庭爲單位，故實行起來頗多困難。</p>
<p>（十）工廠青少年的配給</p>
<p>工廠中對整備職員不可增配，曾有人提出這強硬的意見。並主張對制度工員撤廢額外增配。至於青少年，包含勤勞學徒在內，大體依現在量即可。</p>
<p>（十）（一）食生活的再檢討</p>
<p>關於普及粉食（即面食），曾提出製粉能力，燃料，運輸力，分配方法等的障礙問題，他如希望國民的食習慣變向粉食，並要求由國家推進原料供給。</p>
<p>米得勝資源的信用化，不能不自粉食始，故今後應悉心研究。又在整備方面，因現在配給面粉，小麥粉故應更減少米的扣除量。市民的希望現在的混入大豆，不如米與豆各別配給，借用食糧的混用，自夏至秋更見激增，道從使是新米登場期的關系原是不得已的辦法，但希望在一年　平均配給，取締各種配給食糧的不正秤量，生　類當作蔬菜配給的希望，在會場中均有提出。</p>
<p>生活的改善，最主要之點，在於用最低的分米，發揮最大的營養效率，不使政府方面，各家庭亦不能不不悉心研究改進。（翔：　自七月十三日朝日新聞）。</p>

<h3>血與淚（十）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　　洪洋譯</p>
<p>由於賤職的不謹慎，而沈沒了陛下的艦艇，並且釘害了部下。實在罪該可死。但與所有艇員，一直至最後一口氣，而全能在自己的崗位上沉著從事工作，我們雖說爲國家而犧牲，但令我們不能瞑目者，是擔心天下之士對於我們有所誤解，對於潛水艇的將來事業裏足不前，只是這一點。希望諸位愈加勉勵，用全力研究潛水艇的發展，如是我們則死而無憾。</p>
<p>沉没原因</p>
<p>由於以汽油潛航過深，雖想關閉塞阻，但中途破壞，後用手堵亦來不及了，所以後部完全成爲水池，約二十五度的傾斜而沉没。</p>
<p>沉没後情形</p>
<p>（一）傾斜爺角約十三度。</p>
<p>（二）因配電盤浸水，電燈熄滅，電　起火，煤氣發生，呼吸感覺困難，十四日上午十時沉没。在此窒息的煤氣下，以手　抽水機盡力排水。</p>
<p>（三）一沉下即由主庫開始排水，電燈熄滅，固然看不清楚，但我認爲主庫的排水工作業已完畢，電流不能完全用光。電液尚留少許，海水不再浸入，煤氣亦停止出現，殘餘養氣約五〇〇磅，唯一所特者爲乎緊抽水　。</p>
<p>（以上乃　司令塔的光陰，於十一時四十五分，用筆記出。）</p>
<p>浸入水中的艇員大部，衣服全都濕透，但並不感覺寒冷。我常常向潛水艇員說，如不膽大心細，是不能有發脹的，但不要過於緦而遇事畏痛。如果世人不以此次失敗而嘲笑我們，則我確信上述的話是不會錯誤的。</p>
<p>（一）司令塔的深度表爲五十二度，努力實行排水工作，至十二時而停止，此處深度有十餘丈，不敢說這是正確的。</p>
<p>（二）潛水艇員士卒，是需要　取出類拔萃者中的拔萃者，在此困難時期，幸而艇員各能盡其職，我甚滿足。</p>
<p>我每逢出家，都有死的決心，所以遺囑是在「韓畸」的抽屜裏（但關於此事無談的必要，請田中淺見史呈給家嚴一閱）。</p>
<p>公開遺囑</p>
<p>謹陳於陛下，我只希望所部遺族不受饥寒所迫，謹向左列諸君致意（名次隨意）。</p>
<p>（一）　藤大臣――（筆者注，以下諸老前輩的姓名略去）氣壓過高，深感鼓膜如破。（又繼續寫姓名）。</p>
<p>十二時三十分，呼吸非常痛苦。</p>
<p>汽油雖積在一處，但被　汽油味所　倒。</p>
<p>（一）中野上校（廣：想追念姓名）</p>
<p>十二時四十分</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>上面就是佐久間上尉的遺書，俗語說，從此而不哭者非人，實在是一個趔。遠在三十餘年前寫的文字，一直到今天還有無上的感人力量。</p>
<p>隆夫聽了Ⅰ上校的話以後，在校內的參考館內，曾看了一下遺囑　的　巧複寫版。也看了一下掛在牆上的尉及其他艇員的照片。所有的人，都呌我們五體投地的感動。</p>
<p>「佐久間艇長和廣瀨中校，甚至在後學校時，也是崇拜的目標。學生中，都在這兩個人中選擇自己崇拜的對象……」</p>
<p>真人這樣人說。同時還說，四月十五這一個遇難的日期，也佔海軍史中光明的一頁。</p>
<p>「上校的話語中曾說，四十三號艇的穴見上士的遺囑中，也有佐久間艇長所說的字句。這或許是佐久間上尉的影響，或是傳統。真偉大！」</p>
<p>隆夫走著這樣說。</p>
<p>「再就是上尉對部下所說的話，那種神情，如不是軍人，或許不易理解。」</p>
<p>真人這樣回答。他在這樣回答中，就好像在真想一個部下的情形一樣。</p>
<p>「但潛水艇也真夠可憐吧！尚未作過一次戰。真人如在其他種艦艇上服務，豈不是更會早日以願身手吧！」</p>
<p>「不。」</p>
<p>真人的回答，只是這一句。爽快的　笑，完全補充了話語的不足。須臾間，兩個人走到本部門附近的潛水艇神社的前面。潛水艇學校的參觀，只剩了這一個最後的對象了。</p>
<p>真人說，我們再參拜廟吧！</p>
<p>「在六號艇中，普通參觀者進來也沒有關係來，我在前領著。」</p>
<p>「好，到這裏去麽？」</p>
<p>隆夫胸脯中跳動著。</p>
<p>巡視了一下全長七十三英尺的艇體，彎著腰，因爲太小。隆夫對於這樣小，竟大吃一驚，而遇難原因的通風管，像沐浴池的煙筒一樣，突出於艇的外面，一眼望過去，心中像針刺般的痛。</p>
<p>一昇到白木台階上，覺著又有了新出口。在這個地方向艇內前進了一步，要面除了暗暗的電燈光和司令塔射進來了外面光線外，只有黑漆一團。（一二九）</p>
<h3>國民論壇　國定教科書　實施配給的提議</h3>
<p>— 木尚</p>
<p>自　端啓發以來，因生産與耗費的相距關係。所以萬物都陷入漲潮中，誠然各種書夭課本的幾次三番加價，也是難免的事實。</p>
<p>但是書本到底是關於文化的專項，它對於中華民國的前途是有切身的利害關係，並非其他所能一概而論。於是有關當局爲適應戰時環境起見，把初中及小學的所用課本，統納成一氣，一概歸於國定，並且極力　底舊價，使其平民化。小學生受益非淺，講到它的計劃，可說是無出其右的了。</p>
<p>然而因爲國定教科書售價底康的緣故，所以不久竟造成一種畸形的局面――記得去年初中國定國文版本，衹售三元餘一冊。但是普通書局所印行的卻需三十元左右。　其售價相差，竟達十數倍。難然內容國定較差，但是　張印刷方面卻還勝過普通一籌。於是這種局面形成不久。一般普通所版的書籍，自然是大受影響，營兼以致不振。可是上海人善於派「　頭」，商人腦勁無窮不入，只要有利可圖，那管它傷天害理，有關全國。眼看國定教科書如此賤價，幾乎勝過「稱斤頭」，於是便拼命收買囤積。國定課本所印之書籍，分配全市中小學生，本尚可敷衍過去。給他這麽一來――弄得正式書店不存一冊餘貨。學生們雲仍是售不到所　的書，同時黑市書籍也乘此而生，繼之飛漲。小學生呌苦連天，呼　無門。上述是過去上學期的事實。當事者（中國聯合出版公司）亦興安盟其中弊端。一直是在今年暑期一再增加書價，動輒數倍（見前之本論壇）。他的目的，大概是欲與普通書價衡，不致造成上述之局面。</p>
<p>倡增加舊價在必需情形下，固然是應有的事，然而像這種漫無止境的增價，卻是不應有的現象。在今日能得求學的幸運，已是煞費心機的了，再加上這筆重大的負擔，更是千辛萬苦了。何況當局創行國定讀本，幫是使其普遍化的，那麽這類「拔苗助長」的矛盾現象，那裏又是當局的本心呢？</p>
<p>講到上述各種弊端，在根本上講，當然是竭力抑平普通書籍的售價。但是最緊要而需待解決的，還是實施配給，把書籍計萁　所需的配給。當然這並不是單指學校一方面而言，凡是真正需要的人都能得著，總之，是不使那些刁滑商人所能乘機，而使每一個學生都能得到賤價的書籍。</p>
<p>關於　到配給的方法，誠然是有執事者的優良辦法，無等　述。</p>
<h3>社會服務　改革葬殮之建議</h3>
<p>際此物資缺乏，百物購貴，民生凋疲之秋，一般平民及流浪遊民，偶有死亡，輒成嚴重問題。良以薄棺一具，所費亦屬不　，本市雖有善團，辦理施棺義葬，然此種艱鉅工作，總感汲長綆短，心餘力抽之苦，窮以爲際茲劃時代時期中，此種事務，實有改革必要，用敢將鄙見所得，建議如下，藉供　獎之獻。</p>
<p>人體一死，知覺全失，所以死後葬殮，祇求其衛生而已。故無務平民，及無主收領之流屍，儘可用　包裹運往義塜埋葬。至於火葬，本極衛生，而雙經濟，但本市尚無平民火燒火燎葬場之設備，在平民火葬場未設立之前，不妨提倡「風土」葬。</p>
<p>在滬郊義塚，埋葬一般流屍。現在義塚，多數仍將棺柩涇露地面，非特攸關衛生，且日積月累，土塚數累，整塊地面，化爲無用。所以埋葬，務使深邃，入土至少六七尺，則腐化臭氣不致上升。</p>
<p>可得勝上述空地，種　樹木，（可能範圍，每一埋屍處，種植一株），二十年後，林木　然，伐之成器，不亦一舉兩得！</p>
<p>上述　見，不過略　梗概，至於詳細組織，尚有待於社會當道，慈善機關，　劃旅行。在此苦難期中，當代賢達，諒不河漢斯　，幸甚！（倪亞平）</p>

<h3>Rice Storage Registration: Many are Waiting to See</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of restoring rice rationing for households, according to news reports in recent days, the responsible authorities are actively working on it, and it is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time. It is believed that most citizens are closely watching this issue, especially the poor who have no food for the next day, who feel it is even more urgent. However, another issue, which is also very important, especially for middle and upper-class citizens, is the public notice of rice storage registration issued by the city's goods distribution office.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the goods distribution office announced that anyone in the city area who, as of August 5th, had stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity should apply for registration with the First Section of the office before noon on August 10th. The so-called "prescribed quantity" is: rice shops, businesses, factories, entertainment venues, and other organizations storing more than 12.5 shi (石) of rice; citizen families storing more than 6 dou (斗) of rice per person. The announcement also stated that the purpose of the registration was to clarify the amount of rice stored in the city, and there was no intention of confiscation or forced purchase. However, those who refuse to apply for registration or make false registrations within the specified period will be confiscated once discovered.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the authorities have clearly stated the purpose of the rice storage registration and have no intention of confiscation or forced purchase. Therefore, citizens who have stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity should promptly apply for registration within the deadline and should not wait and see, missing the registration time. Registration must be absolutely honest, and there must be no concealment or falsehood, because after registering in accordance with the regulations, there will be no loss of confiscation or forced purchase. This is the order of the authorities, and to maintain credibility, they will absolutely not deceive the citizens. On the contrary, if citizens have stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity and conceal it without registration, or if they register but make false statements, this is a violation of the law. Once discovered, the authorities will confiscate it to maintain their authority. At this time, the citizens' loss is their own fault and cannot be avoided. The registration date ends before noon on August 10th. Time is pressing, so don't hesitate and wait and see, or you will regret it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the purpose of rice storage registration is to clarify the amount of rice stored in the city. To put it more thoroughly, it is to deal with unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, fundamentally eliminate the factors of monopoly and speculation, and fluctuate rice prices. In the past, citizens who accumulated excessive grain to avoid high prices must register truthfully, because after holding the registration certificate, they will obtain legal status for their stored rice and be protected. If the purpose of storing rice is to hoard and speculate, and they conceal it hypocritically or underreport, they deserve to be confiscated if discovered. If the rice price stabilizes due to panic selling, it will also be beneficial to the public.</p>
<p>Secondly, from various observations, at this time of year when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet in, the authorities have a solid and sufficient guarantee to restore household rice rationing, so that it will not be delayed or reduced in quantity. In addition to two sheng (升) of rice per person per ten days, the quantity of flour and miscellaneous grains will also be increased to gradually achieve equality between rationing and consumption. This is what the citizens hope for and what the authorities are striving to achieve.</p>
<p>Finally, what we cannot help but say is that it is heard that police, civil servants, industrial workers, etc., have special rations in addition to ordinary rations. We sympathize with those who have meager salaries and heavy responsibilities, who enjoy special rations. However, teachers and staff in educational institutions, who also have meager salaries and heavy responsibilities, should enjoy the same treatment as the above-mentioned personnel. Therefore, we advocate that teachers and staff in public and private universities, middle schools, and elementary schools also have special rations. We hope that the education authorities and the rationing authorities will discuss this as soon as possible to make it a reality.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Sinks US Cruiser in the Sea East of Ogasawara; Over Forty Enemy Aircraft Attacking Chichijima Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4 PM on August 6th that on the morning of August 4th, enemy mobile units appeared in the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands. On the 4th and 5th, they bombed Chichijima. On the 5th, the enemy shelled Chichijima with several cruisers and destroyers. Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down more than 41 enemy aircraft and destroying one cruiser, driving them back. Japanese losses were light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – In response to the landing operations on the islands of Omiya and Tinian, the enemy forces again attacked the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands with a mobile unit on the morning of the 4th. On the 4th and 5th, they bombed Chichijima and Iwo Jima. On the 5th, they shelled Chichijima with several cruisers and destroyers. About one month has passed since the previous attack on the Ogasawara Islands on July 3rd and 4th. The Japanese garrison fought bravely and persistently, upholding their belief in victory, and repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. The detailed battle situation is as follows: Iwo Jima was bombed by enemy aircraft three times on the 4th. In the first wave, 13 out of 77 enemy aircraft were shot down. In the second wave, 12 out of 70 aircraft were shot down. In the third wave, 3 out of 50 aircraft were shot down, totaling 28 enemy aircraft shot down. On the 5th, three enemy B-24 aircraft attacked in two waves, one in the first wave and two in the second wave. On the 4th, 22 enemy aircraft attacked Chichijima, and 3 were shot down. On the 5th, more than 400 large aircraft and B-24 aircraft attacked again, and 10 were shot down. A total of 13 enemy aircraft were shot down on both days. On the 5th, a large enemy aircraft appeared over Chichijima and was immediately shot down by heavy Japanese artillery fire. On the 5th, several enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled Chichijima. On the 4th, enemy aircraft appeared in the sea near the Ogasawara Islands and attacked Japanese ships twice. In the first attack, there were 50 enemy aircraft, and in the second attack, there were more than 50 enemy aircraft. Japanese air forces attacked the enemy mobile unit on the 5th, sinking one enemy cruiser. Japanese losses were light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base in the central Pacific reports that a unit of the Japanese army on Dafu Island has been constructing fortifications in the area west of Haruta Mountain, northeast of Akashi Street, since July 21st. They are engaging in fierce bayonet combat against enemy forces supported by tanks, artillery, and aircraft, inflicting heavy damage. Currently, the Japanese forces in that area are gradually moving northward and are engaged in fierce fighting centered on the three-way intersection of Hiratsuka Street.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Completes Iron Wall Defense Line in the Bay of Bengal; Aerial Combat Unfolds in the Andaman Islands</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located on the front line of the Indian Ocean, are a strategic line for defending the Greater East Asia resource zone and a major fortress for controlling the sea and air in the Bay of Bengal. The terrain stretches 1,700 kilometers from the southern tip of Myanmar to the northern tip of Sumatra, linking more than 200 small islands, each less than 1,000 square kilometers. Port Blair, the capital of South Andaman Island, has become the city it is today after several developments. Except for Great Nicobar Island, the other islands are dense forests, and there are very few places where simple land bases can be built. Under these geographical conditions, compared with other fortresses, it has the special characteristics of a modern fortress line in terms of ease of defense. Now, judging from the enemy's counter-offensive, Port Blair in South Andaman Island is about 2,000 miles from Ceylon and about 2,000 kilometers from Calcutta, which, calculated at the speed of 25 miles per hour for enemy warships, can be reached in just one day. Therefore, in the vast sea of ​​the Bay of Bengal, the Japanese army is rushing to form an iron-like defensive wall, and to use it as a base for active naval and air forces. Even if the enemy can successfully land on any small island in the archipelago, it will be difficult to establish an air force base on the island due to the aforementioned geographical conditions. It will be even more difficult to attack other islands. Any attempt to invade is like trying to catch a dragon with a short rope and only serve as food for the Japanese naval and air forces. Currently, bombing and reconnaissance battles are repeatedly unfolding near the Bay of Bengal. The enemy has tried to reconnoiter or bomb the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while the Japanese army has repeatedly bombed Calcutta, Madras, and Colombo. When the Indian Ocean theater heats up, the Bay of Bengal, a modern maritime fortress line, will boast the most solid base, but it will soon become a base for the Japanese army to capture India. The climate in the Indian Ocean is rainy from May to November and dry from December to May. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are purely of the Indian Ocean climate, which is very comfortable. During the dry and rainy seasons, the temperature is hottest at noon, but it is not as sultry as on the continent, and the nights are unusually cool, requiring only a blanket to sleep. There is almost no rain during the dry season, and the sea water in the Indian Ocean is like oil, and the weather does not change much. However, during the rainy season, it is not surprising to have rain all day long, and the tides in the Indian Ocean are very large, and the turbulent waves fill the sky, which greatly hinders combat and the maneuverability of warships. The total population of the Andaman Islands is about 120,000, most of whom are Indians, about 118,000, and Burmese only account for 2,000. Because the area was once a penal colony, most of the residents are convicts and their descendants. There are more men than women, at a ratio of about three to one. In the past, under British rule, the residents suffered all kinds of penal colony life, and because they were eroded by the British ideas of liberalism and individualism, they lost their original character, so they lacked the communal spirit of mutual aid. The area has always been the largest prison in East Asia. The comrades of the Indian independence movement who were previously imprisoned were all sent back to mainland India by the British army one week before the Japanese army entered in March of the 17th year of Showa (1942 in the Republican calendar). The residents are ignorant and do not care much about the issue of Indian independence. After the Japanese army entered, the military government tried its best to promote the way of the king to these pure residents with Jewish ideas. Under the guidance of the military government, the Andaman branch of the Indian Independence League was organized. After several reorganizations and expansions, the league established the Indian Independence Volunteer Army in December of the 18th year (1943). Its development has been extremely rapid. Under these circumstances, the 120,000 residents are gradually sweeping away the Anglo-Saxon interest in</p>
<p>Indian independence</p>
<p>The movement, as a member of Greater East Asia, cooperates with the Japanese army to fight together.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Advances North in the Leizhou Peninsula</h3>

<h3>Under the Unified Cooperation of Land and Air, the Japanese Army Launches a General Attack on Hengyang; the Chongqing Army Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 7th (Central News Agency) – Under the unified cooperation of land and air forces, the Japanese army launched a general attack on Hengyang on the evening of the 4th. At 7 PM on the 5th, the Japanese first-line troops were already in hand-to-hand combat, advancing from the southern area of ​​Hengyang to the area north of the Southern Army Highway, the strongest position of the enemy forces. The Japanese army, which was fiercely attacking the secondary southern area, captured the high ground south of Xinghua Village and the high ground west of Xichan Temple. At dawn on the 5th, they fiercely attacked Tongqiandu and Yunmushan in the west of Hengyang, completely annihilating one division of the enemy's 79th Army. In order to divert the fierce Japanese offensive, the enemy planned to attack the northern flank of the Japanese attacking forces, and are currently continuously dispatching reinforcements to the periphery of Hengyang, but they are also being intercepted by the Japanese army and suffering heavy losses.

<p>Japanese Army Night Attack</p>
<p>Captures Positions</p>
<p>A Certain Base in Front of the Japanese Army in China, 7th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched a general attack on the evening of the 4th, more than 20,000 Chongqing troops in the city of Hengyang are in imminent danger. The so-called strong Hengyang Chongqing army positions are analyzed as follows: The Xiangjiang River to the east and the Zhengshui River to the north of the city of Hengyang cut off the western and southern areas. Countless swamps and hills surround the area. Many fortresses and positions have been built on this natural terrain, forming a complete fire network. In order to capture the base, the elite Japanese troops used night attacks, braving the Chongqing army's artillery fire during the day, first occupying the front sentinel annihilation positions of the main positions of the Chongqing army, and then destroying the bamboo walls and wooden fences used by the Chongqing army around the Jiangzhao Garden, continuing to advance into the resistance trenches that are several meters deep. The upper part of this type of trench can be used to throw hand grenades, and machine guns are also placed on the side of the base, which has many fire prevention effects. If you climb straight up with a ladder, there is a danger of being shot by machine guns. If you break through this position, there is a broken bank several meters high, which is difficult to destroy even with mountain guns. There are machine gun positions everywhere on the cliff, and beyond this, there are traffic trenches, and if you go forward, there are artillery positions. Behind this, there are many traps. Crossing the traps leads to the main base, which is equipped with stack guns and internal land mines. This type of compound position utilizes effective fire prevention, and the connection between the various positions is convenient, forming a complete fire network.</p>

<h3>The Implementation Committee for Rural Construction Can Be Established Soon: The National Government Officially Promulgates the Organizational Regulations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) The highest level of the National Defense Conference previously passed the Outline for Rural Construction Plan, and at the same time resolved to establish an Implementation Committee for Rural Construction under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, so that it can practically take charge of promoting rural construction work, in order to cultivate the people's livelihood, establish the foundation of democratic governance, achieve the goal of increasing production, and complete the war. After this decision, the relevant authorities are now actively preparing for the establishment of the committee, and it is expected to be established in the short term. At the same time, the entire nation, both government and public, deeply expects the future work and development of the committee. Since our country is founded on agriculture, the past weakness and decline, although caused by many reasons, the most important one is the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, the national economy has almost fallen into a state of paralysis. Thus, on New Year's Day this year, the Chairman specially announced the three major policy focuses, and further pointed out that increasing production is the most important of the policy focuses this year. The organization of this committee to be responsible for rural construction is indeed a practical work to fulfill the goal of increasing production. It is hoped that the future work of the committee will be as follows:</p>
<p>Work promotion should avoid bureaucratization. Rural construction is not an easy task. Those in charge should go deep into the rural areas, integrate with the villagers, understand the villagers' psychology, and recognize the current situation of the rural areas. Otherwise, it would be like scratching an itch from outside the boot, and it would be difficult to achieve practical results. Rural construction should pay special attention to organizing farmers, leading farmers, and educating farmers, so that they can understand the current national situation, stimulate their patriotism, and increase their confidence in rural construction. Rural construction work should strive to guide farmers' farming techniques, disseminate improved varieties of crops, improve agricultural tools, and carry out other rural welfare undertakings. In addition, attention should be paid to rural health facilities and smooth transportation. In this way, rural construction work will surely achieve satisfactory results, which will be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>

In addition, the Soviet army lost 3,000 prisoners of war and about 6,000 dead. Although the Soviet army continued to put pressure on the Tatar Pass, the German army conducted successful offensive and defensive battles in other parts of the Carpathian foothills. West of the upper reaches of the Vistula River, the Soviet army concentrated four elite tank armies. Soviet reconnaissance teams advanced to the northeast of Warsaw, but they were all blocked by the German army. On the Vistula River front, the Soviet army repeatedly attempted to expand its bridgehead northeast of Warsaw, but none succeeded. South of Warsaw, a German tank army advanced despite enemy resistance and made considerable progress. The German defense east of Warsaw also achieved great success.

<h3>Venice Palace at Risk of Being Bombed</h3>
<p>Venice, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters: The magnificent palaces along the Grand Canal in Venice are at risk of being bombed by enemy planes. Most of the city's houses already have cracks because the city's houses are built on the loose soil of the lagoon, which is easily shaken. Therefore, the speed of steamships in the city must not exceed six miles to reduce wave impact. When enemy planes bombed Mestre and Marghera, the heavy air pressure caused damage to some houses in Venice. Some of the city's luxurious houses are owned by foreigners, such as American movie star Mary Pickford and Hutton, the heir to American tycoon Woolworth, who both have villas built here. British Foreign Secretary Eden was also born here, and the house where he was born is still owned by the Eden family.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech: Insisting on the Belief in Victory, Nazi Party Members Pledge Loyalty to the Leader</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters: A reporter from the German News Agency reported on the situation of the meeting of political and party leaders in various German districts this afternoon: General Elba, as the spokesperson for the German Nazi Party leader, first expressed his joy, saying that after the riot of July 20, it was a pleasure to see the leader's health and energy fully restored, and to see the similarities. Then Hitler himself addressed the leaders of various districts to discuss the background of the riot. Hitler pointed out that since the Nazi Party came to power, such traitors have been secretly obstructing the country's ambitious plans for struggle. Although their numbers are small, their power cannot be ignored, and they have repeatedly tried to resist the measures taken by the government. Most of the troops have nothing to do with the above-mentioned traitors, and some have even turned against them. I believe that this riot revealed the inside story of resistance, purged the responsible traitors, and improved the burden on my shoulders. Is this also fate? Now is not the time to draw a hasty conclusion. In the future, the world may understand that this shameful riot will promote favorable results for the future of Germany. Hitler also said: We are fighting against foreign enemies, and I will never retreat. No matter what, we will severely attack them. But I believe that there must be a sense of absolute security and a belief in the loyal cooperation of the rear. This is the condition for the current decision. Now the lazy people have been eliminated. Otherwise, the measures for the full mobilization of the people of our country today cannot be completed. We will use all the military strength and power of the country to overcome all difficulties. Hitler concluded by saying that heaven allows me to survive so that I can continue to fight. I deeply feel that Germany needs someone like me who will never surrender in any situation. I believe that I will forever hold high the banner of loyalty. No matter what blows fate gives me, I will stand firm. Since July 20, I have gained a belief I have never had in my life. Therefore, I will experience this battle and achieve final victory. After Hitler's speech, all the party leaders present expressed their trust in the leader and unwavering loyalty.</p>
<h3>American Troops in Brittany Advance to Laval, German Troops on the Orne Shorten Their Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency: The enemy's center of gravity for operations in northern France is still on the western flank. On the Brittany Peninsula, American tank units have penetrated into the interior. Because the German defenders are concentrated in the most important areas, there have been no major operations. Another American unit, consisting of several tank and motorized infantry divisions, launched an attack east and southeast from the salient south of Avranches, and arrived at Mayenne and Laval (southwest of Rennes) on Saturday evening. Details of the war there are not yet available. The advance of the British invasion area is also on both flanks. The pressure is particularly strong south of Presles, and its breakthrough attempts were all blocked by German grenadiers. Yesterday afternoon, active fighting took place on both sides of the Caen-Falaise highway, in Thury-Harcourt, Fontaine-le-Pin, and north of Saint-Martin-de-Fontenay. After a brief artillery fire, the British army launched a fierce offensive, apparently hoping that the development of the situation on the western flank would force the German command to reduce the German lines in the Caen area. East of the Orne River, the Canadian army, after four days of inactivity, launched an offensive with tanks and infantry between Fourrière and Thury-la-Campagne on Sunday morning, but was repelled. West of the Orne River, the German army's disengagement operation has been completed according to plan, and the German units that were temporarily cut off from contact have advanced to the German lines. West of the Vire River and near Pois, the American army, under the cover of tank and motorized vehicles, broke through several gaps after a strong artillery preparation, but all of them have been closed.</p>
<h3>The Mission of the New Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Significance of the New Cabinet</p>
<p>The first significance of the establishment of the new cabinet lies in the reorganization and completion of the leadership lineup in the Army and Navy, which are at the core of the Greater East Asia War. That is, by establishing a four-headed system of Chief of the General Staff, Chief of the Naval General Staff, Minister of the Army, and Minister of the Navy, pouring all efforts into command and military administration to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>After the loss of Saipan Island and the war situation facing a new stage, the supreme command's planning and the military administration's assistance each sought suitable candidates, so that the substantial content could be enriched, and all power could be centralized. This was the first step in the new plan, with the incumbent Navy Minister Nomura and the beloved Chief of Staff Umezu in the previous cabinet. This plan now awaits the establishment of the new cabinet to be realized.</p>
<p>The second significance of the establishment of the new cabinet lies in renewing the people's hearts and uniting the total strength of the nation. The future war situation is expected to become more intense. If the enemy's so-called air raids on the mainland become more and more fierce, then even women and children in the rear cannot help but use their own strength to reduce the falling ammunition. Materials will become more and more scarce, and in this difficulty and lack, all the people, in order to exert their total strength, willingly endure, and advance the war with full hope. This depends largely on the influence of the personality of the leaders. This is the second significance of the new cabinet. The bright and accommodating state of the Koiso-Yonai cooperative cabinet will earn the people's comprehensive trust.</p>
<p>The Nature of the New Cabinet</p>
<p>From the above, the nature of the new cabinet is naturally clear. That is, first, it is a powerful decisive battle cabinet that wants to move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War with a more strengthened lineup. Second, in order to achieve this decisive battle political approach—that is, to truly give play to the total strength of the people—it is necessary to use harmony to make all the people actively stand up to carry out the war.</p>
<p>The Cabinet's Composition to Fulfill the Above Mission</p>
<p>First, the great order to form a cabinet was conferred on Generals Koiso and Yonai. The two men worked together to lead the machine and form a cooperative cabinet. Second, as the Pacific decisive battle intensifies, General Yonai, who allowed the entire navy to exert the true navy spirit, returned to active service to serve as Navy Minister.</p>
<p>The combination of General Koiso's courage and strategy, and General Yonai's bright and open-minded character, is expected to be the most senior war-fighters who are both stern and gentle.</p>
<p>The Basic Trends of the New Cabinet's Policies</p>
<p>The new cabinet will contribute all its political and economic power to the war in the decisive battle period. Therefore, the new cabinet's policies will first be directed towards strengthening the domestic decisive battle posture and increasing production by leaps and bounds. The true meaning of the total national uprising is that the people of all classes automatically participate in the war with vigorous fighting spirit. Merely manufacturing poor products that are unusable in quantity is not a rise in productivity. The new cabinet's production guidance should first focus on this keynote, which is the first step in the rise of production.</p>
<p>The New Cabinet's Mission</p>
<p>The new cabinet is a powerful cabinet that is doing everything possible to promote the war. The war situation has now approached the time to defeat the Anglo-American counteroffensive. Taking advantage of this counter-offensive opportunity, in order to make it most effective, a national war posture is necessary. Therefore, it is the first mission of the powerful cabinet to promote powerful policies.</p>
<p>The fundamental way to carry out this powerful policy is to first cultivate harmony. In a true total war, the full strength of every citizen is required. This kind of big war cannot be won without putting the entire nation to death. It is the second mission to be frank with the people, to communicate with the people, and to fight the war together.</p>
<p>When taking the above attitude, the government can absolutely trust the people. And the people can also have the confidence to trust the government. If a powerful policy is promoted on this confidence, it can be smoothly completed without friction or obstacles. At that time, opponents can sometimes be punished severely, and emergency measures such as the decisive battle can be strengthened. In order to increase productivity, new production patterns that adapt to the new situation can be boldly adopted. In short, it is the third mission to carry out bold and powerful policies with confidence.</p>
<p>However, the war situation will not immediately improve with the establishment of the new cabinet. Politicians ultimately rely on the people's individual support. Now is the time for all the people to deepen their awareness of being happy to endure the future difficulties on the basis of a correct understanding.

<h3>A Review of the Tojo Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Tojo Cabinet was in power for two years and nine months. It initiated the war against Britain and the United States shortly after its formation, and thus remained a cabinet dedicated to waging war. During this period, Prime Minister Tojo focused primarily on strengthening the close relationship between state affairs and the high command, establishing a national unity system based on the perspective of total war, and consolidating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>The Tojo Cabinet was established on October 18, 1941, the most tense period of the crisis between Japan and the United States. The war broke out less than two months later, making it the most significant event during the Tojo Cabinet's term. The relationship between the government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association became inseparable due to the personal connections of Abe and Tojo. During this period, a large number of officials were dismissed to reform the officialdom. With the unfolding of the war, the Ministry of Greater East Asia was established to manage foreign affairs in the Greater East Asia war zone. After the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Foreign Minister Togo resigned immediately. Ambassador Tani, stationed in China, assumed the position of Foreign Minister, and Aoki, economic advisor to the National Government, became Minister of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in April of 1943, the cabinet was reorganized in response to the sentiment within the 81st Diet. Minister of State Ando became Home Minister. Representatives Yamazaki and Oma of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association joined the cabinet. Vice President Goto of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association joined the cabinet. Ambassador Shigemitsu, stationed in China, became Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Tani, Home Minister Yuzawa, and Agriculture Minister Ino resigned. Prime Minister Tojo not only inspected within the country, but also visited various countries and regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to personally observe the situation. A dramatic development in the China policy was the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. Furthermore, in the autumn of 1943, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo to build the Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's counterattacks intensified, and the ferocity of the war demanded the establishment of a domestic war footing. Therefore, on September 21, 1943, the Tojo Cabinet decided on the Essentials of National Policy Management in a cabinet meeting, attempting to establish a domestic war footing.</p>
<p>The long-shelved Ministry of Munitions was finally established, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Planning Board were abolished. Related to this, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications were merged into the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Along with this reform of the central administrative structure, Minister of State Teiichi Suzuki and Minister of Communications Terashima resigned. Commerce Minister Kishi, as Minister of State, also served as Vice-Minister of Commerce and Industry. Prime Minister Tojo concurrently held the position of Minister of Munitions, and Mr. Ginjiro Fujiwara became Minister of State. Local administrative organizations were also reorganized in conjunction with the restructuring of the central administrative organizations, and local administrative councils were established. The governors of each prefecture assumed the position of head of the local administrative association. Thus, administrative organizations that had been difficult to handle in the past were also given a fresh look. The cabinet advisory system and the administrative inspection system were also implemented during this period. Minister of State Fujiwara and others repeatedly conducted administrative inspections to enhance munitions production.</p>
<p>By February 1944, the cabinet further decided on the Essentials of Extraordinary Measures, and began the combat deployment of the entire nation. Student mobilization was implemented on a large scale, and non-essential projects were quickly reorganized. All possible measures to concentrate the nation's strength in national defense, food production, munitions production, and labor mobilization were implemented in succession. It is worth mentioning that General Tojo of the Army assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff, and Admiral Shimada of the Navy assumed the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff. General Tojo had previously served as Prime Minister concurrently with the Minister of the Army and Minister of Munitions, and had no time to rest. In order to promote the unification of state affairs and the high command, he assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff.</p>
<p>However, the war had developed into a serious situation unprecedented in Japan's three thousand years of history. The fierce fighting by Japanese troops and compatriots on Saipan Island was intensifying. From late June of this year, the cabinet, in order to reflect the deepening war situation, and to strengthen the seriousness of the war, based on the need to concentrate all national strength to forcefully carry out the war, undertook this mass resignation.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters has decided to implement air defense drills tomorrow, the 9th, the eighth Air Defense Day, according to the above alarm issuance and cancellation times. On one hand, it will guide the immediate deployment of personnel after the issuance of the alarm to engage in air defense combat, and prepare the necessary air defense equipment. On the other hand, it will urge companies, banks, factories, and other special buildings that have not yet established special air defense units to quickly set up such air defense units to complete air defense self-defense facilities. This drill focuses on the following items: It is hoped that everyone will cooperate to ensure the thorough implementation of the drill: (1) Inspection of the preparation status of drinking water and firefighting water during air raids (firefighting water tanks must especially be filled), (2) Inspection of the preparation status of air defense equipment held by firefighting groups (there is a continued tendency for injuries when climbing ladders during drills, attention should be paid to strengthening the work and usage methods), (3) Drills stipulated in the Army and Navy Air Defense Command Notice No. 24, (4) Strengthening of blackout equipment, (5) Training of blackout surveillance posts and surveillance teams, (6) Emergency mobilization drills for air defense personnel (especially drills for hypothetical engagement), (7) Inspection of rescue materials.

<h3>Materials Distribution Office - Commences Rice Stock Registration - Director Feng Explains Key Points of Registration</h3>
<p>The city's Materials Distribution Office is conducting a registration aimed at understanding the amount of rice stored in Shanghai, as well as the rice stocks held by citizens exceeding limits. After notifying the public, the registration will be carried out from the 6th to the 10th of this month. Director Feng You of the office gave the following speech yesterday:</p>
<p>Establishing a Strong Distribution System</p>
<p>It is said that food is the people's heaven. The volatility of the Shanghai citizen's food supply is a serious threat to their livelihood and runs contrary to the government's initial intent to stabilize rice prices and reduce price increases. The establishment of this office is aimed at streamlining the Shanghai materials distribution system and establishing a strong distribution system. The purpose of this city-wide rice stock registration is to understand the amount of rice stored in the city.</p>
<p>Rice Stock Registration is Not Confiscation</p>
<p>How much rice is actually stored in Shanghai? Is there illegal hoarding or monopolization of the food supply? It is difficult to obtain accurate statistics without conducting a widespread registration. Therefore, we urgently hope that citizens will cooperate fully, report the true situation in their storage facilities, and not underreport or overreport. This measure is purely for the legitimate needs of protecting citizens. Rice stocks that do not exceed the regulations do not need to be registered. We ask that citizens with limited rice stocks apply for registration based on the actual quantity of rice stored in the city. Absolutely no rice will be confiscated or purchased. Shanghai's rice stocks are extremely abundant and not lacking. New grain has already begun to arrive, and the future of food supply is quite optimistic. In fact, there is no need to purchase or confiscate rice.</p>
<p>Underreporting Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>In order to effectively protect the legitimate supply of rice to the people, anyone who underreports in an attempt to conceal and hoard will be severely punished upon verification and will not be tolerated. For thoroughness, allied military police and the Japanese consulate, as well as the city's Economic Security Office, will be mobilized to conduct a thorough investigation to prevent evasion and inaccurate registration. All citizens, for their own benefit, must not test the law and face severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Flies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>His Excellency Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Allied Nations stationed in China, has come to Shanghai on official business and plans to inspect and liaise with various parties in the city. It is reported that he arrived at the airport at 3:30 PM yesterday (7th) on a special flight from Beijing. Accompanying Ambassador Tani were Secretary Shimizu and Secretary Terasaki.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Immunization Begins</h3>
<p>The second phase of immunization by the Municipal Health Bureau has commenced on August 1st as scheduled. The format of the immunization certificate has been slightly changed from the first phase. There is no red horizontal line on the front, and the back is printed with a red number. This new certificate will be issued on the spot by each immunization team upon completion of the immunization. In order to be thorough, the bureau has sent immunization teams to various main streets, stations, and wharves to administer cholera vaccinations and issue immunization certificates. They will also closely inspect the validity of immunization certificates held by citizens at any time. The certificate is valid for three months. Citizens are advised to pay attention. Expired certificates are invalid, so they should apply to the immunization teams for re-immunization.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Unifies Police Organization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Police Bureau has completed the unification of all municipal administrations, and the organization of the police has been unified. The numbers of the police officers of the former Second Police Bureau have been reorganized based on the numbers of the police officers of the former First Police Bureau, and orders have been issued. All female search officers in the bureau have also been uniformly renamed female police officers, and they will be trained in medical and police knowledge in the future. The police brigade of the former Second Police Bureau has been renamed the Security Police General Brigade, with Wang Tingdong appointed as the commander. The water patrol team has been renamed the Water Police General Brigade, with Zhang Dianjia appointed as the commander. Tian Hongsheng has been appointed as the director of the police training center branch, and Shi Wenfeng has been appointed as the director of the police hospital branch. The police officers of the former Second Police Bureau have also been adjusted and assigned to various branch offices.</p>
<h3>Donation for Warplanes - 10 Million Yuan - Three Representatives Heading to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>The city's Donation for Warplanes Campaign has been progressing smoothly since its launch. All sectors of society have been responding enthusiastically and sparing no effort. It is reported that the standing committee of the campaign has decided to present 10 million yuan in the first installment and has selected Standing Committee Members Liu Diyu, Yang Shanzhang, Jian Wu, and Zhu Dingsan as representatives to present the donation in Beijing today.</p>
<h3>Strict Crackdown on Unhygienic Street Vendors - The Municipal Health Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is concerned about public health and the health of citizens. In the past, during the summer season, when epidemics were rampant, all infectious diseases tended to spread. The transmission of summer diseases is mostly caused by unclean food. Therefore, it was announced that street vendors selling sour plum juice, jelly, and cut fruits along the road would be subject to crackdown. It is now reported that personnel have been dispatched to strictly enforce the crackdown in order to protect the health of citizens. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will respect themselves and not buy these foods to avoid contracting diseases.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau to Relocate on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, having been ordered to relocate to the former site of the First District Health Office at 223 Hankou Road on the 11th of this month, is actively preparing for the relocation. All incoming and outgoing documents and license applications will be processed at the new location from that date.</p>
<h3>News of Zhao, Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Resigning Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Since Director Zheng Zongtang took office at the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, he has been sparing no effort in reforming the judiciary. The Ministry of Justice has placed great emphasis on him. However, there have been rumors that Chief Prosecutor Zhao has requested to resign due to fatigue. The reporter visited Mr. Zhao to inquire about this matter. Mr. Zhao said, "I was ordered to serve as the Director of the Prosecutor's Office. I am now working diligently to reform the internal affairs and have not expressed my intention to resign. As for whether I will be transferred, that is up to my superiors, which I cannot predict. However, I am determined to adhere to the principle of not being idle and not resigning. As long as I am in office, I will do my best every day." This means that the rumors are definitely not true.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Exchanging Joint Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>In order to promote the exchange of materials between the North and the South, streamline and develop industrial and commercial trade, and prosper the market, the Central Reserve Bank entered into an agreement with the North China United Reserve Bank three months ago to implement the circulation of Huazhong and North China, with the exchange rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank notes. It designated 11 banks, including the Sino-Japanese Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Continental Bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, as exchange banks. Since its implementation, trade between the North and the South has become increasingly prosperous. It is now reported that in order to facilitate merchants and travelers, travelers from Shanghai going to North China or North China travelers coming to Shanghai who need Central Reserve Bank notes and Joint Reserve Bank notes can go to the Foreign Exchange Department of the bank to exchange Central Reserve Bank notes at the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. However, it is stipulated that travelers holding first-class or second-class tickets can only exchange up to 500 yuan to prevent fraud. This will be implemented from this month.</p>
<h3>Police Sub-Bureau Judiciary Directors Hold Joint Meeting - Director Li Explains Tasks of Judicial Police</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau was formally established after the merger of the former First and Second Police Bureaus, the city's police facilities have been actively strengthened. In order to improve the city's judicial police system and increase administrative efficiency, the Judicial Affairs Office of the Municipal Police Bureau held a meeting of the judicial directors of all sub-bureaus at 2:00 PM yesterday in the conference hall on the 8th floor of the Municipal Police Bureau on Fuzhou Road. More than 60 judicial section chiefs from the urban area and Nanshi Zhabei sub-bureaus attended the meeting, and Director Li Shiyu, Deputy Director Ying Xian Erlang, and section chiefs from the crime prevention section provided guidance.</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>Director Li gave a sincere address, stating: "After the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau unified the city's police administration, the first judicial director meeting was held in Xichang. I hope that you will all abide by the will of Director Jian and work together sincerely, regardless of your background, and strive to improve in accordance with the new regulations and the established policies of this office. Secondly, you should learn humbly and improve your skills in a timely manner. In particular, colleagues from the former Second Bureau may be less familiar with the documents, formats, and investigative procedures of this office, but as long as you make an effort, you will definitely gain something. Finally, for the protection of human rights, our task as judicial police is to safeguard the dignity of national laws, protect the lives and property of the people, and ensure personal freedom. We can prevent harm before it occurs and reduce harm to the nation, society, or individuals. This is the most reasonable way to progress. I hope that you will all practice what you preach and carry out your duties earnestly. In the case of incidents that have already occurred, you must seek the truth and discover the evidence. You must never resort to torture to extract confessions. If anyone uses violence or abusive language against litigants, they will be severely punished for corruption. As for the detention of defendants, it must also be in accordance with the provisions of criminal procedure and should not be abused in order to comply with Director Chen's sincere intention to love the country and its people."</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Credit Situation Is Loosening</h3>
<p>Shanghai's credit situation has recently shown signs of easing, and investment projects are showing a prosperous trend. Financial institutions have improved compared to before, with increases in deposits and loans. The previous tense financial situation is gradually easing. It is reported that the main reasons for this are: (1) The Central Reserve Bank refuses to provide interbank lending to those who are not in need or are hoarding goods, but provides as much lending as possible to those in legitimate need or investing in production projects. (2) The Central Reserve Bank’s Gold and Foreign Exchange Department allows ten listed stocks to be used as deposit reserves, so the cash positions of various banks and money shops are eased. (3) Banks and money shops are allowed by the authorities to provide stock collateral loans. (4) Agricultural products are being transported to Shanghai one after another, and funds from the interior are flowing back.</p>

<h3>Reader's Educational Aid News - Allied Friends Sympathize with Students Out of School - French Tram Company Donates Large Sum</h3>
<p>We began grading the high school exam papers yesterday, and most of them were above standard, especially some of the papers were particularly excellent. Therefore, we deeply feel that these talented and hardworking young people are the backbone of the nation and society in the future. If they drop out of school due to poverty, wouldn't it be a waste of great talent? Whose loss is this? Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel uneasy and lost. Fortunately, all sectors of society are enthusiastically donating money to urge us to promote the educational aid movement so that the outstanding young people we see do not drop out of school. However, we hope that impoverished students with above-standard grades can all continue their education. At the same time, we believe that this is also the common hope of enthusiastic people in society. You donate money, we donate our time, and everyone promotes the educational aid movement. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Songqun has raised 100,000 yuan donated by the French Tram Company. Although Mr. Wu's words carry great weight, the company's authorities are allied French people. This shows their great sympathy for our cause of nurturing talent, which is very touching. Even foreign merchants have such enthusiasm, so merchants with successful businesses should not lag behind. Why not donate some money?</p>
<p>Donations for Educational Aid - Enthusiastic Response</p>
<p>Wang Xingchang Niqihao says: "We are located at 807 Nanjing Road. Due to recent business expansion, our shoe department will open on August 8th. In addition to the bargain prices for the first seven days, in order to support the educational aid fund of both newspapers, we will hold a donation for educational aid for one month. We will extract 5% of the total business revenue and donate it to the Shenxin newspapers' educational aid fund. We hope that all sectors of society will participate enthusiastically and support this righteous cause together. Once the [unclear] is full, we will present the accumulated amount. However, new businesses are opening every day in Shanghai. If everyone can respond, it will be like accumulating sand into a tower and gathering fur into a robe. Then tens of thousands of impoverished students will not drop out of school."</p>

<h3>Enemy American Generals in Chongqing Expose Contemptuous Attitude: Information Director Matsudaira Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Reported by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, at 2:30 PM yesterday (7th), the regular press conference was held on the 8th floor of the Shanghai Bund on Nanjing Road. Information Director Matsudaira, accompanied by his advisor and consul, arrived promptly. Director Matsudaira delivered a speech on the latest international situation and the economic situation in the city, lasting an hour and a half. The following is a transcript of Director Matsudaira's speech:</p>
<p>The contempt of the enemy Americans for the Chongqing army has aroused discontent among the lower ranks in Chongqing. Recently, a lower-ranking officer of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India deserted from the interior and returned to the embrace of peace. According to his statements, he spoke extensively about the enemy Americans' contempt for the Chongqing army. This clearly shows the enemy's disdain for Asians and their attitude towards East Asia, which is self-evident. It is known that the Chongqing-派遣ed駐印軍, initially aimed to avoid British and American contempt, subjected the soldiers to strict examinations. In addition to rigorous testing, recruits had to be tall, at least five feet six inches, to qualify. Furthermore, their education level had to be at least equivalent to a complete primary school education. However, even after such rigorous testing, the駐印軍 in India still faced constant contempt from the British and American armies, who consistently assigned them the most difficult tasks. Consequently, lower-ranking officers and graduates of the Chongqing駐印軍 opposed the British and American armies' poor attitude more and more. To prevent dissatisfaction among the Chongqing lower-ranking officers, the British and Americans proposed sending British and American officers to directly command the Chongqing army, to avoid friction and dissatisfaction with the Chongqing officers. This proposal specifically mentioned the ancestral homeland. The British, Americans, and Canadians all agreed, but the Chongqing officers vehemently opposed it. The Chongqing government's idea was that Americans would be in charge of division commanders, while the lower-level regimental commanders would be Chongqing officers. This principle had already been acknowledged by Song Ziwen in the United States. However, Jiang Jieshi, witnessing the opposition from his subordinates, officers, and Whampoa Military Academy graduates to American command, concealed Song Ziwen's acknowledgement in the United States, finding the situation difficult. Initially, he also opposed it. It began in July when American General Stilwell visited Chongqing and discussed the matter extensively with Jiang. As a result, Jiang conceded. According to recent news, this international division has already set off from the border and is heading to the Ninth War Area. This seemingly contradictory international division, harboring different dreams, is bound to repeat past mistakes and will not achieve good results.</p>

<h3>J. Zhan's Preface</h3>
<p>— Chen Huang</p>
<p>The "Post-Refugee Group" painted by Mr. Jiang Zhaohe, hosted by Mr. Li Si, Mr. Wang Shishi Tuan, and Mr. Chen Bin Yu, is being publicly exhibited in China Garden. I was honored to be invited to the preview and had the opportunity to examine it thoroughly, and I am very satisfied. This painting by Jiang Zhaohe deeply embodies the "Responding to objects by depicting their forms, conveying and transferring their appearances" as described in Xie He's Six Canons of Painting. Moreover, he employs a mixed and broken style, making it particularly outstanding. In my opinion, modern figure sketching: Huang Yingpiao understood the principles of "bone method using brush, managing composition." Now, having seen Mr. Jiang's work and considering them together, all six canons are included. Regarding painting styles, Huang Shen's style is like flying white, Gao Fenghan's outlines are like engraving, and Jiang Zhaohe's embellishments are like cursive seal script. As for the merits of the works, the readers can judge for themselves, which I dare not comment on. In my free time, I have read the history. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, there was a great drought, and famine was rampant. At that time, Wang Anshi was in power and implemented the New Policies, "collecting taxes harshly, northeastern refugees, every time the wind and sand rose, supporting each other on the roads, frail and suffering, without complete clothing, or eating wood fruits and grass roots, even wearing shackles, carrying tiles and boards, constantly being apprehended by officials." Zheng Xia, Supervisor of Anshangmen, painted what he saw as "Refugee Map," falsely claiming it was to contend for favors, and secretly delivered it to the emperor. Emperor Shenzong repeatedly reviewed it, sighed several times, and could not sleep, so he temporarily suspended the New Policies. Now, Zheng Xia's paintings are not passed down, but the sufferings still exist, and they are even amplified. The sorrowful sight is the same as in ancient times. This is why it is named "Post-Refugee Map."</p>
<h3>Sports: Volleyball League Finals - Guangdong-Guangxi Wins Championship, Women's Green Team Wins Title</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volleyball League concluded yesterday with the finals held at the Zhongshen Sports Field starting at 5:15 PM. In the women's group, the Green team faced the champions of the Three Provinces League. In the first set, Three Provinces relied on Chen Meizhen's spikes to win the set. In the second set, Huang Xingfen and Huang Mingyuan of the Green team pursued relentlessly. The players of Three Provinces were overly nervous and lost three consecutive sets, giving the Green team the women's title. In the men's Group A final, Guangdong-Guangxi took the lead in the first set with a score of 21-15. Wang Deyuan of the White team made some fierce spikes, but Guangdong-Guangxi had strong stamina. As a result, Guangdong-Guangxi defeated the White team three to one and won the Group A title. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Green team defeated Three Provinces, 19-121, 21-19, 21-18.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi defeated White team, 21-15, 21-17, 20-22, 21-16.</p>
<h3>Fuhua Cup Small Ball: Huatong Defeats Police and Security</h3>
<p>The Fuhua Cup small ball competition held its second event yesterday. From 5:30 PM at the Donghua sports field, the first match was between Jishi and German Merchant. Jishi was helped by Gu Di Rong and Gao Xiu Qing, first broke through, but the German Merchants responded. Unfortunately Fuen misses. Jishi led in the first half. After switching sides, Jishi became even more rampant, Yu Zhen Yue scored a goal. Jishi defeated the German merchants two to zero. The second match was between Huatong and the Police and Security team. Huatong benefited from Fa Fanxiao's assistance, and the lineup was completely new. The main player of the Police and Security team, Yu Liming, was sick and weak, and their strength was greatly reduced, resulting in a one-sided game. Fa Fanxiao scored a goal in the first half, followed by Zhou Qilin and Fa Fanxiao scoring two consecutive goals. Huatong defeated the Police and Security team three to zero.</p>
<p>Huatong: Zheng Tongyu, Qin Biga, Zhou Qilin, Feng Shoupeng, Wu Jiabao, Meng Yangliang, Cao Qinfang, Fa Fanxiao, Li Songjun.</p>
<p>Police and Security: Tao Ziming, Wang Xisheng, Jiang Tongshan, Yu Lihua, Yuan Zhentian, Yin Qingbing, Zhang Dingxiang.</p>

<h3>Ensuring the Decisive Battle for Food</h3>
<p>The investigation of food administration, led by Mahama, the head of the Great Hemp Administration, began on July 8th to 10th, starting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the Metropolitan Police Department to get a general understanding of the situation. The subjects of discussion included not only staple foods and fresh ingredients, but also a review of the supply and demand relationships for processed instruments and delicacies, as well as the supply of food for factory workers, schools, youth, infants, pregnant women, and other related issues. Virtually all issues related to food were covered. The following is an explanation of the issues raised:</p>
<p>(1) Review of Comprehensive Food Allocation</p>
<p>Today, the food problem in cities is that the supply of vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, and other destroyed items has been greatly reduced. The burden is concentrated on one type of staple food, leading to problems. Although the minimum allocation standard for staple foods has been decided, allocation standards for other fresh foods have not been set. If their supply continues to decrease, families will become dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Approximately how much food does the average Japanese person need to continue daily labor and maintain their weight? To date, research laboratories in various regions have published numerous reports from a thermic point of view, but the government itself has not conducted a scientific review to reach conclusions. As a result, the allocation of fresh foods lacks standards, despite the need for responsible administration.</p>
<p>This point was raised at the meeting, and it was noted that researching the minimum amount of food needed to maintain the weight and nutrition of the average Japanese factory worker, youth, and pregnant woman is quite difficult. Although a general goal has been decided, considering the current conditions of labor, transportation, and materials, perishable goods are difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to consider medical and nutritional conclusions and determine a course of action that takes into account the actual food supply. Those in power only need to ensure the supply of rice, vegetables, fish, meat, and all other foods. If they can declare absolute assurance, people can feel secure. Therefore, fresh foods should be managed by the state in the same way as staple foods such as rice and wheat.</p>
<p>(2) Allocation Standards for Staple Foods</p>
<p>Whether it is possible to use some method to revise the current allocation standard of 2.3 cups is also one of the topics for review.</p>
<p>The current allocation system is divided into more than a dozen categories, and there are special allocations for factories. The first point of discussion is to simplify all the complex allocation stages and revise the standard amount. The second point of discussion for revising the standard amount is to thoroughly eliminate double allocations and false population reports. Someone at the meeting suggested that if a considerable amount of food is freed up by thoroughly investigating false population reports, it should be reserved for years of famine. Regardless of the conclusion reached from the investigation of the standard amount issue, the government must guide the people and encourage them to endure hardship for a long time, conserve food, and continue the war.</p>
<p>(3) Rectification of False Population Reports</p>
<p>How many false population reports are there today? Some believe there are many, but others believe there are not many. However, it is necessary to rectify them to create a surplus. From the perspective of national ethics in wartime, this kind of situation cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>The first source of false population reports is in the so-called canteens in business locations. The second is in factories, the third in allocation agencies, and the fourth is in false claims of various occupations. The method of investigation is based primarily on the national census implemented on February 12th of this year. The government also investigates the actual population receiving rice allocations on the same day nationwide. The false population reports in each prefecture are, of course, calculated here. Based on the results, fundamental measures to eliminate false population reports must be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>The method of eliminating false population reports is to conduct on-site investigations. In canteens, the movement of free laborers should be strictly investigated, and certificates should be issued for those who transfer out. Regarding the number of false reports in factories, the Metropolitan Police Department also conducted on-site investigations last year and found tens of thousands of false reports. Since then, the actual number of male and female workers has been investigated every three times, and the investigation of transfers has been intensified. The investigation of long-term absentees has gradually reduced the number of false reports. However, investigating large factories and managing factories is actually quite difficult. Officials and civilians should establish a joint inspection committee to take on this responsibility. Regarding allocation agencies, the livelihood of allocation workers should be ensured, their income should be guaranteed, and supervision should be strengthened while also training the awareness of allocation workers. On this point, there are still issues that need to be improved in the Food Management Group.</p>
<p>False claims of various occupations have been revised since last year. In Tokyo, each time the high ledgers are updated, the allocated population decreases by tens of thousands. On this point, it is hoped that the heads of each group will work harder, frequently change the ledgers, and strictly implement national transfer certificates. However, some false population numbers are unavoidable due to technical compilation reasons, and some are unintentional. In short, the people should deeply understand the reality of the food situation and the war situation and receive the allocation they deserve, while the government should not reduce the minimum allocation necessary for life. By working together, the problem of false population reports can be solved.</p>
<p>(4) Resources That Have Not Been Won</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is studying how many food resources our country has not yet won. "Rice chaff" is one of the targets. Other resources such as sweet potato vines, sweet potato leaves, mugwort seeds, seaweed, etc., are planned to be powdered and saccharified. Pickles are already being used in the Northeast and Hokuriku regions. Fallen apples, defatted soybeans, and oil wrapping are also being studied. Converting the above into rice equates to approximately hundreds of thousands of koku.</p>
<p>(5) Fresh Food Ingredients</p>
<p>Since March of this year, the collection and distribution mechanisms for vegetables and fish in the six major cities have been gradually reformed.</p>
<p>Starting this year, each major consumer city is striving for self-sufficiency in vegetables. Vegetable production bonus systems, pickling of excess production, etc., are all being discussed. The secure transportation of vegetables is unanimously considered to be of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Regarding fish, the discussions include guaranteeing fishermen's livelihoods during fishing bans, setting official prices for unorganized fish species, simplifying pricing, strengthening the organization of coastal fisheries, thoroughly distributing materials to fisheries companies, and supervising production records.</p>
<p>As for cattle, the number being raised now is actually higher than before the incident, so slaughtering a considerable number to provide protein is being considered, and private slaughtering of cattle will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>(6) Price Countermeasures for Fresh Food Ingredients</p>
<p>Current price policies focus most on essential goods, especially the staple foods within food. On this point, many people advocate how price policies can better demonstrate their flexibility.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of delegating the authority to set prices during periods of scarcity to local autonomous bodies, especially the citizens of Tokyo, now want to exchange less value for higher-priced goods. Tokyo is the imperial capital with a large population. Considering this special nature, whether the costs required for collection and distribution within Tokyo can be transferred to consumers in Tokyo is an opinion worth noting. However, the relationship between cities and prefectures, the relationship between new prices and the cost of living in Tokyo, the relationship between consumption and prices, the relationship between consumption and low-price policies, and the relationship with the prices of staple foods such as rice and wheat are all factors. Also, the effectiveness of price policies themselves has greatly decreased today, so the view that even if producers' prices are greatly increased, the government's organizational capacity cannot penetrate is also worth noting.</p>
<p>(7) Review of the Meal Ticket System</p>
<p>There is much discussion about whether a national joint meal ticket system that deducts allocated rice can be implemented in our country, as it has already been implemented in Manchuria.</p>
<p>This is to stop part of the food for business use that does not require meal tickets and increase the distribution to families. In this way, current meal ticket holders are spared the inconvenience of having to eat out in general canteens with the general public. Under the current food situation, it is indeed possible to abolish general canteens and stabilize the security of cities.</p>
<p>(8) Congee Canteens</p>
<p>This can also be said to be a current security measure. In Tokyo, the total number of people eating in congee canteens in each association is 450,000 to 60,000. At the meeting, it was discussed that the associations sell non-compliant food to make a profit, which hurts the feelings of the citizens. Therefore, it was advocated to completely abolish congee canteens and replace them with government- or autonomous body-run public canteens.</p>
<p>Rest during air raid alerts is also a problem, and the lunch for salaried workers and the food for security guards during air raid alerts must be considered and a new plan must be established taking into account the meal ticket issue.</p>
<p>(9) Milk and Alcohol</p>
<p>The milk problem, which is related to the nutrition of infants, is quite serious. The future direction should be to corporatize the collection and distribution mechanisms, and the allocation amount for each district should break away from the past performance-based system and be adjusted based on the actual population ratio. Other proposals, such as deducting the rice allocation for those who need milk and allocating alcohol and other delicacies selectively, were discussed. However, candy is different from alcohol; candy is given on a unit basis to children and pregnant women, while alcohol is given on a household basis, so it is quite difficult to implement.</p>
<p>(10) Allocations for Factory Youth</p>
<p>Some strongly suggested that factory personnel should not receive increased allocations. They also advocated abolishing the extra allocations for contract workers. As for youth, including working students, the current amount is generally sufficient.</p>
<p>(11) Re-examination of Eating Habits</p>
<p>Regarding the popularization of powder foods (i.e., flour-based foods), problems were raised regarding milling capacity, fuel, transportation capacity, and distribution methods. It was hoped that the national eating habits would change toward powder foods, and it was requested that the country promote the supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>The crediting of rice winning resources cannot but begin with powder foods, so it should be carefully studied in the future. Also, in terms of preparation, since the current distribution is of flour and wheat flour, the amount of rice deduction should be further reduced. Citizens hope that the current mixing of soybeans will be replaced by separate allocations of rice and beans. The mixing of food borrowing has increased sharply from summer to autumn. Although it is an unavoidable measure due to the emergence of new rice, it is hoped that it will be allocated evenly throughout the year, that the unjust weighing of various allocated foods will be prohibited, and that fresh foods will be allocated as vegetables. These hopes were raised at the meeting.</p>
<p>The most important point of improving life is to maximize nutritional efficiency with the lowest amount of rice. Not only the government but also each family must carefully study and improve. (Sho: From the Asahi Shimbun, July 13th).</p>

<h3>Blood and Tears (10) The Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Due to my incompetence, His Majesty's warship sank, and my subordinates were harmed. I truly deserve to die. However, all the crew members, until their last breath, remained calm and dedicated to their duties. Although we say we sacrificed ourselves for the country, what prevents us from resting in peace is the fear that people will misunderstand us and hesitate in future submarine endeavors. This is the only concern. I hope everyone will work harder and dedicate themselves to researching the development of submarines. If so, we will have no regrets even in death.</p>
<p>Cause of Sinking</p>
<p>Due to diving too deep using gasoline, we attempted to close the blockage, but it broke midway. Trying to plug it with our hands was also too late, so the rear section completely flooded, causing a list of about twenty-five degrees, and we sank.</p>
<p>Situation After Sinking</p>
<p>(1) Angle of list was approximately thirteen degrees.</p>
<p>(2) Because the distribution panel was flooded, the lights went out, a fire started, gas was generated, and breathing became difficult. We sank at 10:00 AM on the 14th. Under this suffocating gas, we tried our best to pump water out using manual pumps.</p>
<p>(3) As soon as we sank, we started pumping water from the main tank. The lights were out, so we couldn't see clearly, but I believe the main tank's pumping work was completed. The current could not be used up completely. A small amount of electrolyte remained, seawater no longer entered, and gas stopped appearing. About 500 pounds of residual oxygen remained. The only special thing was to tighten the water pump.</p>
<p>(The above was written in the conning tower at 11:45 AM.)</p>
<p>Most of the crew who were submerged in water had their clothes completely soaked, but they didn't feel cold. I often told the submarine crew that if you are not brave and careful, you cannot develop confidence, but don't be too timid and afraid of pain when things happen. If the world does not ridicule us for this failure, then I am sure that what I said above will not be wrong.</p>
<p>(1) The depth gauge in the conning tower read fifty-two degrees. We worked hard to pump water out until 12:00, but the depth here was more than ten zhang. I dare not say if this is accurate.</p>
<p>(2) Submarine crewmen and soldiers need to be selected from the best of the best. Fortunately, in this difficult time, each crew member was able to fulfill their duties, and I am very satisfied.</p>
<p>Every time I go out, I am prepared to die, so my will is in the drawer of "Han Qi" (but there is no need to talk about this matter, please present it to my father through Tanaka Asami Shi).</p>
<p>Public Will</p>
<p>Humbly presented to His Majesty, I only hope that my unit's surviving families will not be forced by hunger and cold. I respectfully extend my greetings to the following gentlemen (names in no particular order).</p>
<p>(1) Minister Fuji... (Note by the author: The names of the following elders are omitted.) The air pressure is too high, and I deeply feel that my eardrums are about to burst. (He continued to write names).</p>
<p>12:30 PM, breathing is very painful.</p>
<p>Although gasoline has accumulated in one place, I am overwhelmed by the gasoline smell.</p>
<p>(1) Colonel Nakano (Guang: wants to recall the name)</p>
<p>12:40 PM</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>The above is Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's will. As the saying goes, anyone who doesn't cry at this is not human. It is truly a tragedy. Written more than thirty years ago, these words still have unparalleled emotional power today.</p>
<p>After hearing what Colonel I said, Longfu looked at a skillfully copied version of the will in the school's reference hall. He also looked at the photos of the lieutenant commander and other crew members hanging on the wall. Everyone inspires us to be deeply moved.</p>
<p>"Commander Sakuma and Lieutenant Colonel Hirose were even objects of admiration at the naval academy. Students chose one of these two as their role model..."</p>
<p>Zhenren said this. He also said that April 15th, the date of the disaster, is also a bright page in naval history.</p>
<p>"The Colonel said that there were also sentences in Petty Officer Anemi's will from the 43rd submarine that Commander Sakuma said. This may be the influence of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma, or tradition. It's truly great!"</p>
<p>Longfu said this as he walked.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the way the lieutenant commander spoke to his subordinates, that kind of demeanor, may not be easy for non-military personnel to understand."</p>
<p>Zhenren replied in this way. In his reply, it was as if he was truly thinking about the situation of a subordinate.</p>
<p>"But submarines are truly pitiful! They haven't even been in a single battle. If Zhenren had served on other types of warships, wouldn't he have been able to show his skills sooner!"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Zhenren's reply was only this one word. His refreshing laugh completely compensated for the inadequacy of his words. In a short while, the two arrived in front of the submarine shrine near their department. The submarine school tour was only left with this final destination.</p>
<p>Zhenren said, let's worship at the shrine!</p>
<p>"In the No. 6 submarine, it doesn't matter if ordinary visitors come in. I'll lead the way."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go here?"</p>
<p>Longfu's chest was pounding.</p>
<p>Inspecting the 73-foot-long hull, he bent over because it was too small. Longfu was very surprised by how small it was, and the ventilation pipe, the cause of the accident, protruded from the outside of the submarine like a chimney in a bathhouse. Looking at it, his heart ached like a needle.</p>
<p>Stepping up the white wooden stairs, he felt like there was a new entrance. At this place, he took a step forward into the submarine, and except for the dim electric lights and the outside light shining in from the conning tower, everything was pitch black. (129)</p>
<h3>National Forum: Proposal to Implement Rationing of National Standard Textbooks</h3>
<p>— Mu Shang</p>
<p>Since the enlightenment of the beginning, due to the gap between production and consumption, everything has fallen into a price surge. Indeed, the repeated price increases of various books and textbooks are also unavoidable facts.</p>
<p>However, books are ultimately a specialized item related to culture. They have a vital interest in the future of the Republic of China and cannot be lumped together with other things. Therefore, the relevant authorities, in order to adapt to the wartime environment, have unified all the textbooks used in junior high schools and primary schools into national standards and have tried their best to reduce prices to make them affordable for the common people. Primary school students have benefited greatly, and the plan can be said to be second to none.</p>
<p>However, because the price of national standard textbooks is so low, it has soon created a distorted situation. I remember that at the beginning of last year, the Chinese language version of the national standard only sold for a little over three yuan per book. However, those printed by ordinary bookstores required about thirty yuan. The difference in price reached ten times. Although the content of the national standard textbooks was poorer, the printing was still better than the ordinary version. As a result, the ordinary versions of books were naturally greatly affected, leading to business decline. However, the people of Shanghai are good at showing off, and businessmen have boundless ingenuity. As long as there is profit to be made, they don't care if it is harmful or unreasonable. Seeing that national standard textbooks were so cheap, almost cheaper than "selling by the pound," they desperately bought and hoarded them. The books printed for national standard textbooks are allocated to primary and secondary school students throughout the city, which should have been enough. But due to this, not a single copy was left in the formal bookstores. Students still could not buy the books they needed, and the black market for books arose, followed by soaring prices. Primary school students cried out in pain, with no one to listen. The above is the fact of the previous semester. The parties concerned (China United Publishing Company) also discovered the drawbacks. They have been increasing the price of books again and again this summer, often by several times (see the previous forum). Their purpose is probably to balance the price with ordinary books so as not to create the above-mentioned situation.</p>
<p>Advocating for an increase in prices under necessary circumstances is, of course, appropriate. However, such an endless price increase is an undesirable phenomenon. Today, to be fortunate enough to receive education is already difficult enough, and adding this significant burden is even more difficult. Moreover, the authorities created national standard textbooks to make them universal. So, where is the original intention of the authorities in this contradictory phenomenon of "forcing growth"?</p>
<p>Speaking of the above-mentioned drawbacks, fundamentally speaking, it is necessary to try to suppress the price of ordinary books. But the most important thing that needs to be resolved is the implementation of rationing, to distribute the books according to the actual needs. Of course, this does not only refer to the school. Everyone who truly needs the books can get them. In short, it is not to allow those cunning merchants to take advantage of the opportunity, and to enable every student to obtain inexpensive books.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of distribution, there are certainly good ways for those in charge to implement, and there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Suggestions for Reforming Funeral Arrangements</h3>
<p>At a time when materials are scarce, everything is expensive, and people's livelihoods are declining, the death of ordinary people and vagrants often becomes a serious problem. This is because the cost of even a thin coffin is not low. Although there are charitable organizations in this city that handle the distribution of coffins and charitable burials, this arduous task always feels like a well is too deep and the rope is too short, and there is more than enough heart but not enough strength. It is believed that in this epoch-making period, this kind of affairs really needs reform, and I dare to offer my humble opinions as follows, for the sake of offering a humble suggestion.</p>
<p>When a person dies, all consciousness is lost, so funeral arrangements after death only need to be hygienic. Therefore, for ordinary people and unclaimed bodies, it is sufficient to wrap them and transport them to the public cemetery for burial. As for cremation, it is very hygienic and economical, but this city does not have the facilities for cremation of common people. Before the establishment of public cremation grounds, it may be advisable to promote "soil burial."</p>
<p>In the public cemeteries in the suburbs of Shanghai, the bodies of ordinary vagrants are buried. Currently, in most public cemeteries, coffins are still exposed above the ground, which is not only related to hygiene, but also, as days go by and the soil piles up, the whole area becomes useless. Therefore, burials must be deep, at least six or seven feet deep into the ground, so that the odor of decomposition will not rise.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned open space can be used, plant trees (within the possible range, plant one tree at each burial site). Twenty years later, the forest will be naturally formed, and felling them to make tools is not a win-win situation!</p>
<p>The above opinions are just a brief outline. As for detailed organization, it still needs to be planned and traveled by social authorities and charitable organizations. In this difficult period, enlightened people will surely not disregard it, fortunately! (Ni Yaping)</p>
