<h3 id="c1">敵美艦隊的悲慘命運 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>問：敵美艦隊自台灣敗北以後，即集結殘餘部隊，向菲律賓進攻，並在雷伊泰灣登陸，連日激戰，據昨日消息，敵美艦隊已潰不成軍，請問詳情如何？　　答：敵美艦隊這次在菲律賓東方海面戰役中，遭受嚴重打擊，截止昨日止已經潰不成軍，這原是敵美命運中早巳注定的了。所以，我們對於敵美艦隊潰改的消息並不驚奇。因爲我們早已料定敵美這次採用逆戰法，完全是冒險一逞，企圖僥倖。我們在廿六日社評中說過：敵美的錯誤是一希望得到英國艦隊的幫助。二以爲麥克活塞到菲，菲人必表歡迎。三將駐渝美空軍估價太高。四不認識日本陸海空軍的優秀力。因爲敵美有了這樣的錯誤觀念，所以不惜冒險嘗試逆戰法。可是，盟邦日本始終重視內綫作戰的重要性，祗要達到日本防衛圈的內綫，無論在任何角落，都是日本發揮全力擊潰敵人的最好機會，絕對不會容許敵人得到絲毫的僥倖企圖的。大東亞的內綫防衛圈猶之一個堅韌的蜘蛛綱，任何飛虫觸及蛛綱的任何角落時，就沒有生還脫逃的可能。何況這次敵美以台灣敗退之師，根本是冒險舉動，焉有不覆滅之理呢？　　問：然則，過去敵美不是誇張海軍力量如何龐大？飛機生產如何驚人？什麼機械化部隊？什麼艦隊列車嗎？爲什麼在這次戰役中竟在旬日之間已經一敗塗地呢？　　答：不錯，敵美過去會不斷宣傳與誇張軍力之如何強大。我們對於敵美在物質上具有優厚的天然條件，並不否認。所以，盟邦日本旣不輕視敵美的軍力，也不低估敵美的軍力，換句話說，日本對於敵美來犯軍力是予以準確估計的，然後配備足以戰勝的軍力，同時在陸海軍一致協力的奮勇迎擊之下，才可以操必勝左劵，譬如在台灣東海面，敵美是以太平洋主力的第三艦隊，五十八機動部隊爲主的。日軍也就出動聯合艦隊的一部，予以迎戰而擊潰。這次在菲島東海面，敵美是以第五艦隊爲主，並集結麥克沃塞及第三艦隊的殘餘部隊，日軍就以相當於敵軍的精銳部隊，協同菲島陸上的有力部隊迎戰，予以擊潰。所謂：[知已知彼，百戰百勝，]不僅這次的台灣與菲島東海面戰役如此，就是今後的所有戰役也莫不如此。　　問：大東亞戰爭的決戰已經開始，台灣及菲島海面之戰的勝利，是否已經奠定了大東亞戰爭最後勝利的基礎呢？　　答：這次台灣海戰與菲島海戰，是決定大東亞戰爭命運的戰爭，現在這兩戰役先後獲得大捷，當然是奠定大東亞戰爭最後勝利的基礎。不過，今後敵美的再圖蠢動，自亦在意料之中，我們尤應隨時警惕，隨時迎擊。在這決定性的重要戰役中，我們中國並未能在前綫與盟軍駢肩作戰，我們惟有在後方堅定信念，努力本位工作，也就是間接對於戰爭的協力，這是參戰國家後方人民最低限度的任務。</p>

<p>日大本營發表三日間綜合戰果　　東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午四時三十分發表：十月二十四日至二十六日間，敵我艦隊於菲島東方海面之戰鬥，日軍所獲綜合戰果及損失如次：敵美損失計被擊沉者有航空母艦八艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦二艘，運輸船四艘。被擊毀者有航空母艦七艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，被擊毀飛機約五百架。而日方損失艦艇沉沒者計有航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘，受創者航空母艦一艘，飛機未飛還百二十六架，此外尚有二十六日發表，在雷伊泰灣沉沒戰艦一艘，受創一艘。　　東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午三時發表：日軍航空部隊，繼續攻擊雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船及雷伊泰島登陸之敵軍，二十五日夜及二十六日晝所獲戰果中，目下所判明者如次：輸送船擊沉一艘，焚毀六艘，擊毀十一艘，此外，二十六日焚燒中者二十九艘，巡洋艦擊沉一艘，擊毀一艘，驅逐艦擊毀一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦擊沉十艘，油槽船擊毀一艘，艦型不明者擊毀三艘，飛機擊落兩架，焚毀或擊毀七十架以上，敵上陸地點，焚毀七十處（其中四處大爆炸）。</p>

<p>水雷隊採衝鋒戰術創敵　　東京二十七日中央社電　二十六日晨起，日陸軍海軍航空部隊更分別對該方面敵艦船羣開始作殲滅之攻擊，經日陸軍航空部隊分三次轟炸後，敵巡洋艦及其他艦艇被擊沉擊毀者達二十四艘，繼之日海軍航空部隊更擊沉擊破敵巡洋艦及其他各艦七艘，因之雷伊泰灣在日方之絕對制空權下，已成爲日空軍之威力圈，現灣內大有成爲敵艦船埋葬地之勢。又猛烈且正確之攻擊，二十七日晨以來又行繼續。</p>

<h3 id="c5">艦船相接砲火震天 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　菲律賓東方海域之日·美海戰，正大規模展開，日艦隊一部，二十五日上午三時至四時，由斯黎高海峽突八　集敵艦隊及輸送船之雷伊泰灣。援助塔克羅班方面登陸作戰之敵美艦艇，已知悉日海軍突入，乃整隊預備迎擊，是時日方以進攻敵輸送船團之水雷戰隊，採取衝鋒戰術，突入敵船團圈內，敵戰艦四艘，巡洋艦八艘等，企圖阻止日艦隊之襲擊，乃陷混戰狀態，雙方艦船相接，砲火震天，瞬間展開魚雷戰，日空軍亦協力作戰，至黎明敵艦船逐次敗退，日軍乃獲致日大本營前次發表之赫赫戰果，是役日方亦有沉淌及受傷之戰艦各一艘。</p>
<h3 id="c6">美機動隊受大打擊 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日陸海軍各部隊渾然一體，邀擊企圖在雷伊泰灣登陸之敵軍，已捷報頻傳，當十七日敵軍侵入雷伊泰灣時，突遇三十米風力之暴風雨，雙言未能交戰，十八日天氣仍然惡劣，十九日稍晴，日機隊隨即冒強風密雲出動，不斷襲擊停泊於雷伊泰灣內之敵船團及護衛艦艇等，予以相當損害。二十四日天高氣清，日機把握時機，再度進攻雷伊泰灣敵艦艇，日艦隊爲呼應空中作戰，於二十五日晨迅速馳往該地，採取包圍形勢，當即展開空海一體之壯烈戰開，敵軍遭首尾夾攻，混亂已極，着炸後瞬時傾覆，被炸沉及失火者甚多，一時濃烟滿佈海面，景況極爲悽慘，迄二十五日止，日方確認擊沉或擊毀之敵艦船，總數已達五十五艘之多，此項戰果爲歸返艦隊及基地之駕駛員目睹者。二十四日空中偵察雷伊泰灣灣內之敵艦船，較早晨約減少三十艘，其餘船艦恐已全部沉沒，而日軍海空協力，於二十五·六兩日，依然繼續猛攻，戰果於日軍將士之奮戰下確信正逐次擴大中。戰至現在止，因敵之退路已斷，故確認敵運輸船四艘，戰艦五艘，已於淺岸擱淺，同時日軍突擊雷伊泰灣之一戰艦沉沒，又一艘損毀，亦爲事實，可知此次太平洋作戰，實爲空前凄烈之作戰。自二十四日以來，空襲菲律賓之敵機數頓形減少，由此當可想像，日海空部隊所與敵機動部隊之打擊，爲如何之重大矣。</p>
<h3 id="c7">敵艦載機被迫降陸 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>菲島某地二十七日中央社電　日艦隊二十五日晨奇襲貓島（馬薩）東方敵機動部隊，與以潰滅大打擊，是時敵軍忽使其航空母艦艦載機離艦，然此等敵艦載機並不攻擊日軍艦艇，通過日艦艇上空，結羣向西飛去，故日軍深甚懷疑，然此等敵艦載機羣之去向，已由哥倫比亞消息判明，據該廣擴消息稱：二十五日晨有多數敵艦載機突如飛至雷伊泰島，先後被迫降陸於塔克羅班附近海岸平地及機塲，其大部份皆已毀壞，數達一百二三十架之多，僅由以上事實觀之，即可窺知於此海戰中，擊沉幾多敵空母，以及美方之發表之損害如何不確實矣。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日內閣顧問制今日起實施 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日政府頃決定廢棄內閣顧問臨時設置制，另制定內閣顧問制，即自二十八日起實施。茲日情報局二十七日發表如次：當此戰局愈形緊迫，國政益趨微妙複雜之時，爲在輔佐內閣總理大臣之機構上，作更進一步之整備，決裁去過去之內閣顧問制（即關於戰時經濟之運行，爲內閣總理大臣之顧問），另制定新內閣顧問制，選有能之士，不僅在經濟方面，在廣汎之物心兩方面，亦參與內閣總理大臣運行政務之機構。其要領如次：一爲在大東亞戰爭期中，使參與內閣總理大臣運行政務之機構，於內閣中暫設內閣顧問若干，各內閣顧問自有能者勅命之。二內閣顧問得享受親任官之待遇。三昭和十八年之內閣顧問臨時設置制，着即廢止之。</p>

<p>馬尼刺二十七日中央社電　敵軍雖呼號決戰，然於雷伊泰島登陸以來已經一週，仍未得構築有似橋頭堡之陣地，且敵機於登陸作戰，僅經二日後即不見其影，又其航空母艦已被日海軍部隊擊沉，所逃潰敵機無屬歸返，是以目睹日軍精強之匪國民，亦均深深銘感參戰之重大意義，積極協力日軍擊來頑敵之決意愈益鞏固。日軍綜合戰果十月廿七日止　十月廿六止</p>

<p>松島報道部長昨發表談話　　中央社訊　松島艦隊報道部長，昨（二十七）日在報道常會席上，就菲律賓東方海面戰況，發表談話如次：</p>
<h3 id="c13">敵美作戰完全失策 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>此次敵美向菲雷伊泰島來犯之兵力，爲哈爾塞所率之第三艦隊殘餘兵力·史波羅盎斯之第五艦隊·金凱特之第七艦隊·以及澳洲之艦艇數艘之拼湊集中，其兵力大約爲艦艇六七艘以上，航空母艦三十餘艘及驅逐艦巡洋艦與五十餘艘之運輸船隻。查敵方在戰略上之目的，企圖破壞台灣·琉球日航空基地，一面並引誘日本主力艦隊，擬圖予以打擊，然後再作蠢動，將所謂之龐大兵力一舉進佔菲律賓。然而敵美自在北方台灣引誘日主力艦隊，結果在台灣東方海面，即遭遇日軍重大打擊，造成大失敗之局面。敵美之如意打算，又向南方舉兵力犯，作侵佔菲律賓之企圖。查此次敵方在作戰中最大之錯誤，第一，乃謀從南北兩方面作戰之陰謀，企圖密切呼應聯繫，一俟獲勝後，冀求成功，孰料首在北方即告失敗，而在南方之敵軍，猶勉強竭力蠢動。第二，敵方在作戰方面，不勝躁急，而對日軍最有力之把握地，拋棄後方不問，反直向菲中核地帶亂衝。第三，對日軍陸上航空兵力估計太低，無異如當初塞班島作戰之混亂情形。第四，在原來所預定之企劃，適得其反，本身不堪一擊，盲目蠢動，其艦隊之建立，絲毫未有相當訓練，因此敵在雷伊泰灣遭遇空前重大損害</p>
<h3 id="c14">赫赫戰果史所未見 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>此次在菲律賓東方海面作戰，計分戰塲數處，展開激戰，在每一戰塲，日本軍勇猛之作戰精神，所得戰果，在歷來戰史上罕見，尤其感到最愉快者，即日本主力艦隊突在雷伊泰灣出現，堂堂推進，對陸上及海上之敵軍，予以重大之損害，亦爲有史以來所未見。查至本月廿七日止，所得戰果，轟沉擊沉敵艦共計一百三十八艘，內包括航空母艦卅九艘，戰艦十艘，巡洋艦十七艘，如今敵方所剩艦艇，預料僅祇驅逐艦一部份，運輸船十數艘，而雖已登陸之敵三師團兵力，至今巳默默無聲，即如敵美司令長官麥克活塞與美軍之聯絡，已告斷絕，故上陸之敵師團，在短時期內即可殲滅。關於敵方之無稽宣傳稱，麥已登陸，如此說果確，則麥必已爲日軍所俘虜無疑，嗣後又據美國宣傳稱，麥在作戰時頗爲忙碌，無暇聯絡之說，殊屬可笑，原來敵美艦隊擬在太平洋上與日本艦隊決一雌雄，無如敵美之主力喪失，故在今後之大東亞戰局上，日美雙方之立塲，完全相反，深信今後美國將嘗試特別困苦之環境。</p>
<h3 id="c15">空襲九州勞師無功 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>又本月二十三日渝軍政部長何應欽所發表談話稱，美國在菲律賓之攻略作戰，將使日本受致命打擊，如今作戰結果相反，而美國已受嚴重之致命打擊。又據二十七日華盛頓電稱，此次作戰情形，不願發表，惟是日爲美國海軍紀念日，正值日本艦隊向敵美艦隊作大規模之激烈戰，此日羅斯福大總統在白宮廣播，謬讚美海軍之海上實力，並稱此在決定世界歷史運命上甚爲重要，惟此項演說，實爲自圓其詞。此次美軍在太平洋上，顯出之[龐大力量]，不堪一擊，可知其本身之命運之究將如何，羅在最後並謂，相信美海軍定有廣大之造就，由此可見，羅斯福僅爲犬放厥辭，對於海戰實況，毫無具體批評，斯項情形，可知實遭遇非常之重大打擊。再美國此次發表盲炸日本九州之情報，根據今日，經日軍之猛烈迎擊，敵美B29型機被擊落合計有六十架，故敵美在太平洋上之作戰，前途十分悲觀也。</p>

<p>美陸次承認作戰困難　　里斯本二十七日中央社電　紐約電，美陸軍次長柏特遜，二十四日於紐約演說時，會言明對日作戰之困難，其大意如次：美軍必須克報長距離與不利之地勢，日陸軍兵力依然強大，由於召集新兵，益見增強，日軍之作戰絕非僅作防禦，反之，係對於攻勢作戰，其守備地域海岸綫，絕非僅爲抵抗美軍攻擊之受動防禦綫，反以此作爲攻擊基地，於美軍登陸前乃至甫將登陸後，即將之擊滅，日軍依其海空軍之勢力，於反軸心軍於其內綫防禦綫內登陸時，使之全滅，故此日軍刻正傾舉全力建設強有力之空軍。同時日軍更逐漸堅固其沿岸之防備，吾等予過去之作戰，僅觸及日軍前哨基地之島嶼沿岸，然已痛感困難，美軍於各地登陸作戰之先，雖由海空施猛烈砲擊，然日軍之特火點要塞，以及其他防備陣，既登陸以後，猶須一一將之炸毀，日軍內綫防禦綫之防備如何堅牢，實出想傑以上，美軍若於日本防禦地強行登陸時，必須覺悟有力日軍之攻擊，必較諾曼弟之德軍更爲強烈，且於日本勢力內，並無援助美軍之遊擊隊，故美軍作戰益爲困難。</p>

<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據珍珠灣電，美國太平洋艦隊第八補給部隊參謀部員貝阿上校，二十五日就美國軍隊在太平洋戰爭中之補給困難聲稱，在於里亞納作戰中，美軍僅於七星期內，即已消耗燃料達一千五百萬噸，在塞班一役所消費之燃料，較太平洋艦隊一九四三年全年所消耗者尤大，今戰綫愈向西移，美軍補給之困難，料將隨之增加，故美軍非克復此可驚之長距離不可。如勿論東亞方面之地點如何，其對每一登陸美軍之補給，在登陸後三十日內，即每月平均每人最低限度亦須糧食一斗五升之補給，因之美國爲完成太平洋作戰，實非具備新船舶數百噸不可</p>
<h3 id="c18">日軍在菲島操決勝條件 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據倫敦電，敵美登陸雷伊泰島，與諾曼第半島地形相異，該島既無四通八達之柏油路，更無鐵路之舖設，要路兩側森林密佈，酷似新幾內亞，由達古旁至馬尼刺最近距離，有六百公里，其間橫隔無數小島，對登陸軍作戰上妨碍至大，他方迎擊美軍登陸之日軍精銳，更利用各地，建築天然要塞，待機而動，況日軍正式之反擊，迄今尚未開始，此當爲美軍作戰難能順利之先兆。總之，數日來菲島之登陸作戰，僅不過初度之遭遇打擊，關於菲島作戰，預料有三·其一，即不斷展開島與海間之流血作戰，在補給途中，亦與海面作戰相同，每日必須作重大之犧牲，此爲戰勝者於三月半或一年後，決定勝敗之戰爭手段。其二，邀擊登陸敵軍，且在海面一舉擊滅其海上勢力。基三，係合用第一二兩條，使敵登陸軍及補給部隊付最大之代價後，一舉殲滅之。日軍持有此次戰爭之主動性，美國方面決不能否認此點，日軍於天時地利上，均佔有優點，故可隨時把握時機，發動威力，此確爲菲律賓作戰之一大特徽，而美國以大量之人力及物力，犧牲於日軍主動性之戰爭中，此實即菲律賓作戰重要性之所在。</p>
<h3 id="c19">日海軍戰略奠必勝基石 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>日海軍評論家發表見解　　東京二十七日中央社電　日海軍評論家伊藤正德氏，對此菲律賓大海戰發表見解如次：日軍艦隊之出擊，可謂適時適地，乃最高指揮統帥所策劃。吾人所會主張者，[艦隊保全主權]之戰略，今已收獲實果。台灣海面之戰，亦在牽制主戰塲之作戰，在海空呼應之戰塲，邀擊敵軍有力部隊，此乃戰略之成功，戰略旣成功則戰術亦必勝，敵軍於有力艦隊掩護梯形運輸船團之時而攻擊之，實爲得宜。按海戰平時固當視其海面關係而定，但原則上，艦隊之最脆弱時，即護航運輸船團之時，於此時也，攻擊者必能勝利，被攻擊者必遭失敗。且於海面上攻擊軍，能獲得理想之距離，則護航船團所蒙損害亦愈大。日本於明治廿七年九月，以主力艦隊護衛三十餘艘之梯形船團，明治三十七年五月，以特別艦隊護衛八十餘艘均成功。艦隊在準備決戰下，船團在準備脫離下，冒險向登陸地點進行，與此相反者，護航艦隊在一面護衛船團，一面應付主力大海戰者，如一六五三年二月英荷戰爭之波蘭大海戰，荷蘭名將特倫甫緊護船團苦戰惡門，而垂名史冊。按護航大船團，至少須有局部之制海能力，準備海上決戰之護衛，乃在陸上戰鬥緊急不得已之時爲之。（現在之戰爭以局部之制空爲前提）此次敵艦是否直接護衛其船團，雖不能明瞭，但至少亦間接與補給運輸有深密關係，則甚明顯。又日清。日俄兩役，敵軍無進攻之勢，日軍冒險成功，原因在對方警戒不備。戰意未足。戰略未熟等。今日方警戒完備，戰意已達高潮，並有戰略之妙算，此大護航船團在海面遭遇邀擊之危險，可能性頗大，斯所以敵之有力機動部隊及梯形也。顧美軍若向一孤島或類似孤島之島嶼，投以一二師陸軍，則急襲一次，即可登陸乎？欲集中登陸兵力，則必須繼續增援，當然需要大規模之反復護衛船團。美軍事評論家謂，菲律賓之作戰困難，均基於此種見解，美軍兵臨菲律賓，當然需要大規模之兵力，以海上部隊出動於菲律賓近海，動員各種空軍，努力補給，繼續戰門，因之此次戰役已於日方有利。若論戰略射程，則美軍已投入日軍之[戰略射程]圈內，此實可視爲戰勝之基石。日軍爲戰術之完成，亦即爲各戰鬥之勝利，已可集中所需之兵力於戰塲矣。</p>

<h3 id="c54">爲一次發給教薪再向學校當局呼籲 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 唐敬杲</p>
<p>本年二月間，不俀會於本欄揭載[教職員薪水應一次發給]一文，主張[於開學時，學校當局應將一學期中教職員薪水，全數發給，由教職員自行先事安排半年中生活需要。]理由是[學校底學費，是於開學時一次收足的，教職員底薪水，則是依開學時生活指數規定，而於半年中逐月發付的。這半年中生活程度，假定是增加一培，那教職員底薪水，就等於打了個對折，一百元只當五十元用了；假定增加兩倍，三倍，四倍，教職員底薪水，實質上更要依次遞折，以至於無法維持生活。]　　可是本市各校實行這個辦法，在開學時期，把一學期中各教職員底薪水，一次全數發給的，固然已經很多；而藉口種種障礙，依舊按月發給的，還是不在少數。現在法開學時期還不過兩月有半左右，而物價高漲，平均已增加一倍光景，是教職員底薪水，實質上巳經打了個對折了。如果再不從速全數發出，日後物價更兩倍三倍……的增加上去，教職員規定薪水底實際價值，更要三折四折……的折耗下去，對於生活，越發無法應付了。　　因此之故，熱誠籲請學校當局，軫念[同舟共濟]之誼，發揮同情，勿再推諉，而置這個嚴重事實於不顧，從速把一學期中教職員底薪水，全數發給出來，好讓教職員們把至極困苦的生活，勉強地安排應付過去！</p>

<p>我們是一羣清苦的教師，當我們得到教育局的公事，知道教職員特種配給米的購米證，可以到物品配給處領取的時候，我們衰疲的精神，都似乎覺得爲之一振！　　但是我們所希望的，我們的配給米，不要每月分三次領，而讓我們每月三期合併一次領。因爲我們平日白天整天須在學校上課，即使星期日休息，也總有一星期中積聚下來的幾十本幾百本課卷要改清，而且像我們學校在南市，領米處却在前第八區的西端，來去步行，非得費整半天的工夫不可，雖說一月祇要抽三次空，但是誰想得到我們簡直是無空能抽呢？所以我們希望物品配給處能夠設法讓我們每月三期的米能併一次領取，更希望可能更調米店，使每個學校的米配到臨近各該校的米店裹，以節省我們的時間和脚步，那我們這羣枵腹教導來日國家主人翁的苦教師，將感銘腑了。（一羣苦教師）社會服務</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Tragic Fate of the Enemy American Fleet <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Q: After being defeated off Taiwan, the enemy American fleet gathered its remaining forces and advanced toward the Philippines, landing in Leyte Gulf. Heavy fighting has continued for days. According to yesterday's news, the enemy American fleet has been routed. Can you provide details?</p>
<p>A: The enemy American fleet suffered a severe blow in this battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines, and as of yesterday, it has been routed. This was already destined in the fate of the enemy Americans. Therefore, we are not surprised by the news of the enemy American fleet's collapse. Because we had long anticipated that the enemy Americans' adoption of this reverse warfare tactic was purely a reckless gamble, attempting to get lucky. As we said in our editorial on the 26th: The enemy Americans' errors are: first, hoping to receive assistance from the British fleet; second, believing that the Filipinos would welcome MacArthur upon his arrival in the Philippines; third, overestimating the strength of the American air force stationed in Chongqing; fourth, failing to recognize the superior strength of the Japanese army, navy, and air force. Because the enemy Americans held such erroneous beliefs, they recklessly attempted reverse warfare. However, the Allied nation of Japan has always valued the importance of inner-line operations. As long as the inner lines of the Japanese defense perimeter are reached, no matter in what corner, it is the best opportunity for Japan to exert its full power to crush the enemy, and it will absolutely not allow the enemy any chance of getting lucky. The inner defense perimeter of Greater East Asia is like a tough spiderweb; any flying insect that touches any corner of the web has no chance of surviving and escaping. Moreover, the enemy Americans' advance was made by a defeated army from Taiwan, which was fundamentally a reckless move, so how could it not be annihilated?</p>
<p>Q: But didn't the enemy Americans boast about how vast their naval power was? How amazing their aircraft production was? What about their mechanized units? What about their fleet trains? Why have they been completely defeated in just ten days in this campaign?</p>
<p>A: Indeed, the enemy Americans have constantly promoted and exaggerated how strong their military power is. We do not deny that the enemy Americans have superior natural advantages in terms of material resources. Therefore, the Allied nation of Japan neither belittles nor underestimates the enemy Americans' military strength. In other words, Japan makes an accurate assessment of the enemy Americans' invading forces, and then equips itself with the military power sufficient to defeat them. At the same time, with the army and navy working together in a brave and concerted effort to repel the enemy, we can be assured of victory. For example, in the eastern sea off Taiwan, the enemy Americans relied primarily on the Third Fleet, the main force of the Pacific, and the 58th Mobile Force. The Japanese army also dispatched a portion of the Combined Fleet to meet and defeat them. This time, in the eastern sea off the Philippines, the enemy Americans relied primarily on the Fifth Fleet and gathered the remaining forces of MacArthur and the Third Fleet. The Japanese army countered with elite troops equivalent to the enemy's forces, together with strong forces on land in the Philippines, to meet and defeat them. As the saying goes, "[Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle]." This is true not only for the battles in the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Philippines this time, but for all future battles as well.</p>
<p>Q: The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War has already begun. Has the victory in the sea battles off Taiwan and the Philippines laid the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War?</p>
<p>A: This time, the naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines are wars that will determine the fate of the Greater East Asia War. Now that these two battles have been won successively, of course, they have laid the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, it is also expected that the enemy Americans will try to make trouble again in the future, and we should be vigilant at all times and repel them at any time. In this decisive and important battle, our China has not been able to fight side by side with the Allied forces on the front lines. We can only strengthen our faith in the rear and work hard in our respective positions, which is also indirect cooperation with the war. This is the minimum task for the people in the rear of the participating countries.</p>

<p>Imperial Headquarters Announces Comprehensive War Results for Three Days</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 27th that during the battles between enemy and our fleets in the eastern sea of the Philippines from October 24th to 26th, the comprehensive results and losses of the Japanese army were as follows: Enemy American losses include eight aircraft carriers, three cruisers, two destroyers, and four transport ships sunk. Seven aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two cruisers were destroyed. Approximately 500 aircraft were destroyed. Japanese losses include one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers sunk. One aircraft carrier was damaged. 126 aircraft did not return. In addition, there was the announcement on the 26th that one battleship was sunk and one was damaged in Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 27th that Japanese air units continued to attack enemy ships in Leyte Gulf and enemy troops landing on Leyte Island. Among the results achieved on the night of the 25th and the day of the 26th, the following have been determined: One transport ship sunk, six burned, and eleven destroyed. In addition, 29 were burning on the 26th. One cruiser sunk, one destroyed. One destroyer destroyed. Ten cruisers or destroyers sunk. One oil tanker destroyed. Three ships of unknown type destroyed. Two aircraft shot down, and over 70 burned or destroyed. 70 enemy landing points burned (including four large explosions).</p>

<p>Torpedo Squadrons Adopt Kamikaze Tactics, Inflict Damage on the Enemy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From the morning of the 26th, Japanese army and navy air units began to launch annihilating attacks on enemy ship formations in that area. After three bombing runs by the Japanese army air units, 24 enemy cruisers and other ships were sunk or destroyed. Subsequently, Japanese navy air units further sunk or destroyed seven enemy cruisers and other ships. As a result, Leyte Gulf, under the absolute air supremacy of the Japanese side, has become a sphere of influence for the Japanese air force. There is now a strong trend for the bay to become a burial ground for enemy ships. Fierce and accurate attacks have continued since the morning of the 27th.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese-American naval battle in the eastern sea area of the Philippines is unfolding on a large scale. A part of the Japanese fleet, from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM on the 25th, broke through the Surigao Strait and entered Leyte Gulf, where enemy fleets and transport ships were concentrated. The enemy American ships, which were aiding the landing operation in the Tacloban area, were aware of the Japanese navy's intrusion and prepared to meet the attack. At that time, the Japanese torpedo squadron, which was attacking the enemy transport convoy, adopted kamikaze tactics, breaking into the enemy convoy's circle. Four enemy battleships, eight cruisers, and others attempted to stop the Japanese fleet's attack, resulting in a chaotic battle. Ships on both sides connected, cannon fire shook the heavens, and a torpedo battle unfolded in an instant. The Japanese air force also cooperated in the operation. By dawn, enemy ships were gradually retreating, and the Japanese army achieved the remarkable results previously announced by the Imperial Headquarters. In this battle, the Japanese side also had one battleship sunk and one damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e6">American Task Force Suffers Heavy Blow <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese army and navy units, working as one, are ambushing and attacking enemy troops attempting to land in Leyte Gulf, and reports of victories are frequently arriving. When enemy troops invaded Leyte Gulf on the 17th, they suddenly encountered a storm with winds of 30 meters per second, and the two sides were unable to engage in combat. The weather remained bad on the 18th. On the 19th, the weather cleared slightly, and Japanese air units immediately sortied amidst strong winds and dense clouds, continuously attacking enemy convoys and escort ships anchored in Leyte Gulf, inflicting considerable damage. On the 24th, the sky was high and clear, and Japanese aircraft seized the opportunity to attack enemy ships in Leyte Gulf again. The Japanese fleet, in response to the air operation, rapidly moved to the area on the morning of the 25th, adopting an encirclement formation, and a magnificent battle integrating air and sea immediately unfolded. The enemy army was caught in a pincer attack and was extremely confused. Ships were instantly capsized after being bombed, and many were sunk and caught fire. The sea surface was temporarily filled with thick smoke, and the scene was extremely miserable. As of the 25th, the Japanese side had confirmed that the total number of enemy ships sunk or destroyed had reached as many as 55. This result was witnessed by pilots returning to the fleet and base. Aerial reconnaissance on the 24th showed that the number of enemy ships inside Leyte Gulf had decreased by about 30 compared to the morning. The remaining ships were likely all sunk. The Japanese army, with the cooperation of the navy and air force, continued to attack fiercely on the 25th and 26th, and it is believed that the results are gradually expanding thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese soldiers. As of now, because the enemy's retreat route has been cut off, it has been confirmed that four enemy transport ships and five battleships have run aground on the shallow shore. At the same time, it is also a fact that one battleship in the Japanese raid on Leyte Gulf was sunk and another was damaged. It can be seen that this Pacific operation is truly an unprecedented and fierce operation. Since the 24th, the number of enemy aircraft air-raiding the Philippines has suddenly decreased, from which it can be imagined how heavy the blow inflicted on the enemy task force by the Japanese naval and air units has been.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Forced to Land <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in the Philippines, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese fleet launched a surprise attack on the enemy task force east of Masbate Island on the morning of the 25th, inflicting a crushing blow. At that time, the enemy suddenly had its carrier-based aircraft take off from the carriers. However, these enemy carrier-based aircraft did not attack Japanese warships, but flew over the Japanese warships in groups and flew west. Therefore, the Japanese army was deeply suspicious. However, the destination of these enemy carrier-based aircraft groups has been determined by news from Columbia. According to the widespread news, on the morning of the 25th, a large number of enemy carrier-based aircraft suddenly flew to Leyte Island and were forced to land one after another on the flatlands and airfields near Tacloban. Most of them have been destroyed, numbering as many as 120 to 130. From the above facts alone, it can be seen how many enemy aircraft carriers were sunk in this naval battle and how inaccurate the damage announced by the American side is.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Cabinet Advisor System to be Implemented Today <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese government has decided to abolish the temporary system for establishing cabinet advisors and to establish a cabinet advisor system instead, which will be implemented from the 28th. The Japanese Information Bureau announced the following on the 27th: At this time when the war situation is becoming increasingly urgent and national affairs are becoming increasingly subtle and complex, in order to further improve the structure for assisting the Prime Minister, it has been decided to abolish the old cabinet advisor system (i.e., regarding the wartime economic operation, as advisors to the Prime Minister) and establish a new cabinet advisor system, selecting capable individuals to participate in the Prime Minister's administration not only in the economic field, but also in a broad range of material and spiritual aspects. The main points are as follows: 1. During the Greater East Asia War, in order to enable the structure for assisting the Prime Minister in administering state affairs, several cabinet advisors shall be temporarily established in the cabinet, and each cabinet advisor shall be appointed by Imperial Order from among capable individuals. 2. Cabinet advisors shall enjoy the treatment of Imperial appointees. 3. The temporary system for establishing cabinet advisors in Showa 18 shall be abolished immediately.</p>

<p>Manila, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Although the enemy army is clamoring for a decisive battle, it has been a week since they landed on Leyte Island, and they have still not been able to build a bridgehead-like position. Moreover, enemy aircraft disappeared only two days after the landing operation, and the enemy aircraft carriers have been sunk by the Japanese naval forces, and the fleeing enemy aircraft have nowhere to return. Therefore, the Filipino people who have witnessed the strength of the Japanese army are deeply impressed by the great significance of participating in the war, and their determination to actively cooperate with the Japanese army in attacking the stubborn enemy is becoming increasingly firm.

<p>Matsushima Press Chief Issues Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - Matsushima Fleet Press Chief issued the following statement at yesterday's (27th) press conference regarding the war situation in the Eastern Sea area of the Philippines:</p>
<h3 id="e13">Enemy American Operation Completely Miscalculated <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The enemy American forces invading Leyte Island in the Philippines this time were a combined force led by Halsey's remaining Third Fleet forces, Spruance's Fifth Fleet, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet, and several Australian ships. Their strength was approximately 67 ships or more, including over 30 aircraft carriers and over 50 destroyers, cruisers, and transport ships. The enemy's strategic objective was to destroy Japanese air bases in Taiwan and Okinawa, and at the same time lure out the Japanese main fleet in an attempt to strike them. Then, they would recklessly move forward, aiming to occupy the Philippines with their so-called massive force. However, the enemy Americans attempted to lure the Japanese main fleet north of Taiwan, but as a result, they suffered a major blow from the Japanese army in the sea area east of Taiwan, resulting in a major defeat. The enemy Americans' plans failed, and they turned south to invade with their forces, attempting to occupy the Philippines. The biggest mistakes made by the enemy in this operation were: first, the conspiracy to operate on both the northern and southern fronts, attempting to closely coordinate and link up, hoping to succeed after winning. However, they first suffered defeat in the north, and the enemy forces in the south still struggled to act recklessly. Second, the enemy was impatient in its operation and abandoned the rear, regardless of the most powerful stronghold of the Japanese army, and rushed straight to the core area of the Philippines. Third, they underestimated the Japanese army's land-based air power, which was similar to the chaotic situation in the initial Saipan Island operation. Fourth, the originally planned scheme backfired, and they were unable to withstand a single blow. They acted recklessly and blindly, and their fleet was not adequately trained. Therefore, the enemy suffered unprecedented and significant damage in Leyte Gulf.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Remarkable Results Unprecedented in History <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The operation in the eastern sea area of the Philippines this time was divided into several battlefields, where fierce battles unfolded. The courageous combat spirit of the Japanese army in each battlefield achieved results rarely seen in military history. In particular, the most gratifying thing was that the Japanese main fleet suddenly appeared in Leyte Gulf, advancing majestically and inflicting significant damage on the enemy forces on land and at sea, which was also unprecedented in history. As of the 27th of this month, the results achieved include the sinking or destruction of a total of 138 enemy ships, including 39 aircraft carriers and 10 battleships, 17 cruisers. It is expected that the enemy only has a portion of destroyers and a dozen or so transport ships left. Moreover, the three divisions of enemy troops that have landed have now fallen silent. The enemy American Commander-in-Chief MacArthur's contact with the American army has been severed. Therefore, the enemy division that has landed can be annihilated in a short period of time. Regarding the enemy's absurd propaganda that MacArthur has landed, if this statement is true, then MacArthur must have been captured by the Japanese army. Later, the United States claimed that MacArthur was too busy to make contact during the operation, which is ridiculous. Originally, the enemy American fleet planned to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet in the Pacific, but the enemy American main force has been lost. Therefore, in the future Greater East Asia war situation, the positions of Japan and the United States are completely reversed, and it is believed that the United States will experience particularly difficult circumstances in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Air Raids on Kyushu Laborious and Futile <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>In addition, on the 23rd of this month, the Chongqing Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin issued a statement claiming that the American capture operation in the Philippines would inflict a fatal blow on Japan. However, the result of the operation was the opposite, and the United States has suffered a severe and fatal blow. According to a Washington dispatch on the 27th, they are unwilling to disclose the details of the operation. However, the day was American Navy Day, which coincided with the Japanese fleet launching a large-scale and fierce battle against the enemy American fleet. On this day, President Roosevelt broadcast from the White House, falsely praising the American Navy's maritime strength and claiming that it was very important in determining the fate of world history. However, this speech was actually self-justification. The American army's [massive power] in the Pacific has proven to be unable to withstand a single blow. It can be seen what its own fate will be. Roosevelt finally said that he believed the American Navy would have great achievements. From this, it can be seen that Roosevelt was merely making empty remarks and had no concrete criticism of the actual naval battle situation. This situation shows that they encountered a very serious blow. Furthermore, the United States announced the information about the indiscriminate bombing of Kyushu in Japan. According to today's reports, a total of 60 enemy American B-29s have been shot down by the fierce counterattacks of the Japanese army. Therefore, the prospects for enemy American operations in the Pacific are very pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Japanese Army's Powerful Attacks Stronger Than German Army <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>American Undersecretary of the Army Admits Operational Difficulties</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A New York dispatch reports that American Undersecretary of the Army Patterson, in a speech in New York on the 24th, stated the difficulties of operations against Japan, the main points of which were as follows: American forces must overcome long distances and unfavorable terrain. The Japanese army's strength remains strong, and it is becoming even stronger due to the conscription of new soldiers. The Japanese army's operations are not merely defensive; on the contrary, they are for offensive operations. The coastlines of their defensive areas are not merely passive defensive lines to resist American attacks, but are used as bases for attack, to destroy American forces before they land or immediately after they have landed. The Japanese army, based on its naval and air force strength, will annihilate all anti-Axis forces when they land within its inner defensive line. Therefore, the Japanese army is currently making every effort to build a powerful air force. At the same time, the Japanese army is gradually strengthening its coastal defenses. Our past operations have only touched the coastlines of the Japanese army's outpost island bases, but we have already felt the difficulty. Although American forces launch fierce artillery bombardments from the sea and air before landing in various places, the Japanese army's special fire points, fortresses, and other defensive positions must be destroyed one by one after landing. The fortifications of the Japanese army's inner defensive line are more solid than imagined. If American forces forcibly land in Japanese defensive areas, they must be prepared for powerful attacks from the Japanese army, which will be stronger than those of the German army in Normandy. Moreover, there are no guerrilla forces within Japanese territory to assist the American army, making American operations even more difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e17">American Staff Officer Says Supply Difficulties <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Pearl Harbor dispatch, Colonel Bea, a staff member of the Eighth Supply Unit of the American Pacific Fleet, stated on the 25th regarding the supply difficulties of the American army in the Pacific War that in the Mariana Islands operation, American forces consumed 15 million tons of fuel in just seven weeks. The fuel consumed in the Battle of Saipan was even greater than that consumed by the Pacific Fleet in the entire year of 1943. Now that the battle lines are moving further west, the supply difficulties of the American forces are expected to increase accordingly. Therefore, American forces must overcome this astonishingly long distance. Regardless of the location in East Asia, the supply for each landing American soldier, after landing, requires a minimum average of 1.5 dou of food per person per month for the first 30 days. Therefore, in order to complete the Pacific operation, the United States must have hundreds of tons of new ships.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Japanese Army Controls Decisive Conditions in the Philippines <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the terrain of Leyte Island, where the enemy Americans have landed, differs from that of the Normandy Peninsula. The island has neither paved roads leading in all directions nor railways. The roads are lined with dense forests, similar to New Guinea. The shortest distance from Dagupan to Manila is 600 kilometers, with countless small islands in between, which greatly hinders the landing army's operations. The elite Japanese troops who are ambushing and attacking the landing American forces are also using various locations to build natural fortresses, waiting for an opportunity to move. Moreover, the Japanese army's official counterattack has not yet begun, which is a harbinger of the American forces' inability to operate smoothly. In short, the landing operation in the Philippines in recent days has only been the initial encounter and strike. Regarding the operation in the Philippines, there are expected to be three scenarios: First, a continuous bloody battle between the islands and the sea will unfold. The supply routes will face the same losses as the naval battles, and there will be significant sacrifices every day. This is a means of warfare where the victor will be determined in three and a half months or a year. Second, ambush the landing enemy forces and destroy their naval power in one fell swoop at sea. Third, combine the first two scenarios, making the landing enemy forces and supply units pay the greatest price before annihilating them in one fell swoop. The Japanese army holds the initiative in this war, and the American side cannot deny this point. The Japanese army has advantages in terms of weather and geography, so it can seize the opportunity to unleash its power at any time. This is indeed a major characteristic of the Philippine operation. The United States is sacrificing a large amount of manpower and material resources in the Japanese army's initiative-driven war, which is the importance of the Philippine operation.</p>

<p>A Japanese Naval Critic Publishes His Views</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese naval critic Mr. Masanori Ito has published his views on the great naval battle off the Philippines as follows: The sortie of the Japanese fleet can be said to have been timely and in the right place, planned by the supreme commander. What we have been advocating, the strategy of [preserving the fleet's sovereignty], has now yielded fruitful results. The battle off Taiwan was also to contain the main battlefield, and in the sea-air coordinated battlefield, to intercept the enemy's powerful forces. This is a strategic success. Once the strategy is successful, the tactics are bound to be victorious. It was appropriate to attack the enemy's powerful fleet while it was escorting a echelon-shaped convoy. In principle, naval battles should be determined by the relationship of the sea surface, but in principle, the most vulnerable time for a fleet is when it is escorting a convoy. At this time, the attacker is bound to win, and the attacked is bound to fail. Moreover, if the attacking army can obtain an ideal distance on the sea, the damage suffered by the escorted convoy will be greater. In September of the 27th year of Meiji, Japan successfully escorted a echelon-shaped convoy of more than 30 ships with its main fleet, and in May of the 37th year of Meiji, it successfully escorted more than 80 ships with a special fleet. The fleet ventured to the landing site in preparation for a decisive battle, and the convoy in preparation for disengagement. On the contrary, the escort fleet had to defend the convoy while dealing with a major naval battle, such as the Great Battle of Poland in the Anglo-Dutch War in February 1653, when the famous Dutch general Tromp closely guarded the convoy and fought hard at the gate of evil, leaving his name in history. To escort a large convoy, at least a partial control of the sea is required, and the escort in preparation for a naval battle is only carried out when land combat is urgently needed. (The current war is based on the premise of partial control of the air.) Although it is not clear whether the enemy fleet directly escorted its convoy this time, it is very obvious that it is at least indirectly related to supply and transport. Moreover, in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, the enemy had no momentum to attack, and the Japanese army succeeded in taking risks because the other side was not vigilant, lacked the will to fight, and was not familiar with strategy. Today, we are fully alert, the will to fight has reached its climax, and we have a strategic plan. The danger of encountering an ambush at sea by a large convoy is very high. This is why the enemy's powerful mobile units and echelons. If the US military throws one or two divisions of infantry onto a lonely island or a similar island, can they land with a single raid? If they want to concentrate landing forces, they must continue to reinforce them, which of course requires a large-scale and repeated escort of convoys. US military commentators say that the difficulties of the Philippine operation are based on this view. When the US military approaches the Philippines, it will of course need a large-scale force to dispatch naval forces to the vicinity of the Philippines, mobilize various air forces, strive to supply, and continue to fight. Therefore, this campaign is already in Japan's favor. In terms of strategic range, the US military has already entered the Japanese army's [strategic range], which can be regarded as the cornerstone of victory. The Japanese army has completed its tactics, that is, to win each battle, and can concentrate the necessary forces on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) Noon – The 20th Air Force of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the 25th, used about 100 B-29 aircraft to attack Kyushu and Jeju Island in Japan. They were intercepted by the Japanese Air Force's air control unit, which shot down and destroyed 24 aircraft, and then fled in a panic. On the way back, they were attacked by the Japanese air control unit on the mainland of China. Therefore, very few returned to the Chengdu base, and most were forced to land at bases in Sichuan Province or northern Hubei Province. After repairs or reorganization, they returned to the Chengdu base. The Japanese army's surprise attack on the night of the 26th was shortly after the completion of the gathering of these defeated US aircraft. Therefore, the US aircraft that attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island recently have been annihilated. According to reports, the Japanese Air Force's air raid on the Chengdu US Air Force base group was the fourth air raid after the air raids on September 8, 26, and October 7.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to German news, Canberra news, Australian Prime Minister Cowen announced yesterday that the Australian flagship [Australia] was damaged by an air raid on October 20 during its invasion of the Philippines, killing 19 crew members (including Commander Teague), and injuring 54, including Rear Admiral Collins, Commander of the Australian Squadron. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched a major battle with the enemy's US mobile unit in the eastern waters of the Philippines on the 24th, the Japanese army has been winning steadily. After noon on the 25th, under the joint attack of the Japanese fleet in the sea and air, the enemy's aircraft carrier group collapsed in an instant and could only release smoke to escape. Under the Japanese army's urgent pursuit and attack, the enemy's embarrassment reached its extreme. At this point, the enemy army was desperately trying to escape on the one hand, and on the other hand, it frequently reported that [the Japanese fleet is attacking my ship fiercely, please use all your strength to rescue me, and hope that a high-performance aircraft carrier will be dispatched to support me from the Leyte Island area]. At present, the Japanese naval forces are still continuing to fight with the enemy, and the Japanese Air Force is also exerting all its efforts to attack the enemy's mobile unit at any time and place, and gradually expanding the results of the battle.</p>

<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: A German military spokesman stated: The front line in southern Hungary has gradually become clear, and the mutual encirclement attempts of both sides have come to an end. The obvious front line will be clear in a few days. Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: There are battles in the Yonskite region of eastern Hungary. The German army continues to withdraw from Carpathian Russia to the Hungarian border. The German defense line in the shape of a semicircle from Baya on the Danube River via Solnok, Niregyhaza, Mongach, and Zsiget on the Tisza River has become stronger. Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: The German army in East Prussia is using the latest type of [Tiger King tank], which is stronger than the Tiger tank. Not only is the armor stronger, but it is also equipped with a larger steel cannon, which has the upper hand in battles with Stalin-style tanks.</p>

<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: The Soviet army's major offensive between the Bug River and the Narev River in Warsaw stopped on the first day. It is estimated that the Soviet army has discovered that the German side in southern East Prussia has heavy troops, so it is better to attack after further reinforcements. The fighting north of the Etkeolnen-Cambinning highway has intensified again. The enemy still failed to break through the German defense line the day before yesterday. In the evening, the Soviet army broke into Ebenrode and is now engaged in street fighting.</p>

<p>Reporters' Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The 25th Reporters' Meeting was held as usual yesterday (27th). The Propaganda Department invited Education Bureau Director Dai Yingfu to the meeting to report on the general situation of the city's educational administration since he took office, such as the compilation of regulations, the reform of the system, the improvement of treatment, and the implementation of supervision, and to answer various questions raised by reporters. The following is a record of the various questions and answers:</p>
<h3 id="e38">Civilian Education Work <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>1. Central News Agency asked: Shanghai is the cultural center of our country, but illiteracy is widespread. What plans do you have for promoting civilian education in the city in the future? (Answer) The lack of education, that is, compulsory education and mass education, has not been promoted to the ideal stage, so there are many illiterate people in the city. In addition to setting up simple primary schools in terms of compulsory education, the city used to have mass education halls and mass night schools in terms of mass education, but due to environmental, institutional, financial, and personnel factors, they have not been able to develop. Therefore, starting this semester, in addition to reorganizing the mass education halls, we are actively preparing to set up mass morning schools to absorb the general public. We hope that people can assist the authorities and supervise them from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Adjust Treatment <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>2. Central News Agency asked: It is said that your bureau will do its best to find ways to adjust the treatment of teachers and staff in city schools. I wonder if there are any concrete results at present? (Answer) The meager treatment of teachers in public and private schools in the city is well known. If we want them to work hard, we must increase their treatment and stabilize their lives. The average monthly salary of teachers and staff in city schools used to be only 730 yuan for primary schools and only 1,300 yuan for secondary schools. After this bureau submitted a request to the city government, it was approved. From September, the salary has been increased by two times, and subsidies for August have been reissued. Regarding the problem of food rice rations for teachers and staff, this bureau has negotiated with the relevant authorities and is making smooth progress. From October 2nd to the deadline, the number of public and private schools that came to the bureau to register for rations was 5 national colleges and universities, with 492 teachers and staff, 13 private colleges and universities, with 899 people, 7 municipal middle schools, with 265 people, 14 registered private middle schools, with 329 people, 159 unregistered private middle schools, with 3,535 people, 74 municipal primary schools, with 1,003 people, 95 private primary schools, with 1,330 people, and 398 unregistered private schools, with 4,208 people. In the former 18 districts, there were 25 primary and secondary schools, with 735 people. Statistics show that there are 790 public and private schools in the city, with 12,792 teachers and staff. All of them have been reviewed by this bureau, and the list has been sent to the Material Distribution Office for issuance and distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Private School Tuition Fees <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>3. Central News Agency asked: The surge in the cost of living has caused private schools to increase tuition fees significantly, and more young people are dropping out of school. What countermeasures does the authorities have, how to train and reorganize the tuition fees of private schools, and can we add more municipal school classes or expand enrollment? (Answer) Will be submitted to the mayor for approval.</p>

<p>This newspaper published a notice on September 6 in which Shen Bian cried out to all sectors for support for her husband's murder. The content roughly stated that her husband, Shen Xiajiu, was the Baochang of the Ninth Bao of the First Township of Zhenru Town in northern Shanghai. At 5 pm on August 14 this year, Ge Zhiwu, the personnel section chief of the Chongxin Yarn Factory, intentionally caused trouble to her husband for refusing to check household registration. As a result, on the evening of August 23, he sent Lu Zhenfang, a petitioner policeman from the factory, and his son to ambush outside Shen's house. At that time, Shen Jiuxia was shoveling coal dross. Lu immediately stabbed him in the chest and legs with a sharp knife, causing Shen Jiuxia to die. After the incident, the police station arrested Lu Zhenfang on the spot. The procuratorate sent personnel to supervise the forensic doctor to examine the body and confirmed that he had been stabbed to death with a knife, and filled out an autopsy report. The procuratorate has separately disposed of Ge Zhiwu and will not prosecute him. Lu Zhenfang's murderous behavior has been prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, the case was formally tried by Judge Yu in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court. The defendant Lu Zhenfang confessed to stabbing Shen Xiajiu to death. After Shen Xiajiu was stabbed and fell to the ground, Lu beat him with an iron shovel, etc. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

The emerging young players of the Shantou team are striving to achieve, especially Lin Weicong and Chen Qingjiang, who performed outstandingly. Zhongbei's luck in basketball was extremely poor. Unfortunately, Shen Yugong did not score. Last night's game was related to the hope of winning the championship, so the entire stadium was packed, even though ticket prices were doubled, marking the first grand occasion of the season.

<h3 id="e54">Another Appeal to School Authorities to Issue Teachers' Salaries in One Lump Sum <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Jinggao</p>
<p>In February of this year, I published an article in this column titled "[Teachers' and Staff Salaries Should Be Paid in One Lump Sum]," advocating that "[at the beginning of the semester, school authorities should pay the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff in one lump sum, allowing them to plan their living needs for the next six months in advance]." The reason is that "[the school's tuition fees are collected in full at the beginning of the semester, while teachers' and staff salaries are paid monthly based on the cost of living at the beginning of the semester. If the cost of living increases by one-fold during these six months, then the teachers' and staff salaries are effectively halved, and one hundred yuan is only worth fifty yuan. If the cost of living increases by two-fold, three-fold, or four-fold, then the teachers' and staff salaries are effectively reduced accordingly, to the point where it is impossible to maintain a livelihood]." However, in practice, many schools in this city have already implemented this approach, paying the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester; while others, citing various obstacles, continue to pay on a monthly basis. It has only been two and a half months since the start of the semester, but prices have risen sharply, increasing by an average of one-fold. This means that the real value of teachers' and staff salaries has already been halved. If salaries are not issued in full as soon as possible, and prices continue to increase two-fold, three-fold... the actual value of the fixed salaries of teachers and staff will be reduced by three-fold, four-fold... making it even more difficult to cope with living expenses. Therefore, I earnestly appeal to school authorities to consider the spirit of "[being in the same boat]," show compassion, and stop making excuses. Do not ignore this serious fact and promptly issue the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff, so that they can barely manage to cope with their extremely difficult lives!</p>
<h3 id="e55">Hope that Special Rice Ration for Teachers and Staff Can Be Combined and Distributed at Once <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>We are a group of impoverished teachers. When we received the official notice from the Education Bureau informing us that we could collect rice purchase certificates for the special rice ration for teachers and staff from the Goods Distribution Center, we felt a surge of energy in our weary spirits! However, we hope that our rationed rice will not be distributed in three installments each month, but rather that the three installments will be combined and distributed once a month. This is because we have to teach at school all day long, even on Sundays, we still have to mark dozens or hundreds of test papers accumulated during the week. Moreover, our school is in the South City, but the rice distribution center is at the western end of the Eighth District. It takes half a day of walking to and fro. Although it is said that we only need to take time off three times a month, who would have thought that we simply have no time to spare? Therefore, we hope that the Goods Distribution Center can find a way to allow us to collect the three installments of rice each month in one go. We also hope that it is possible to relocate the rice shop, so that the rice for each school is distributed to a nearby rice shop, in order to save us time and energy. Then, we, the starving teachers who are educating the future masters of the country, will be deeply grateful. (A Group of Impoverished Teachers)</p>

<p>This office has always shown sympathy for the Respect for the Elderly Movement. Therefore, all lonely and helpless elderly people who apply to this office for relief are given the utmost care. Funds are allocated from the poverty relief fund to provide assistance. Therefore, the significance of donating to the poverty relief fund lies not only in helping the poor and needy, but also in caring for the lonely and elderly, in order to achieve the goals of loving, caring for, assisting, and providing peace of mind to the elderly. Recently, the weather has been getting colder, and winter relief is urgently needed. Donating money to help the poor and sick is especially pressing.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Seventh Batch of Compulsory Reform and Quit Smoking Program Completes <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Taoyi Compulsory Reform and Quit Smoking Center, affiliated with the Zhongjiao Taoyi Association under special contract to this office, held a farewell ceremony for the seventh batch of group quitters, a total of ten people, yesterday at the association's auditorium. More than forty people from all walks of life attended. Mr. Huang Jingwan delivered a speech on behalf of Bishop Wu, stating that the association, out of compassion for compatriots trapped in the abyss of darkness and unable to be saved, used the "[Shen Kang Du Ping]" injection developed by the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Factory to help patients get rid of their addiction and transform from weak to strong within ninety hours. This is truly a great blessing for you. However, you must remember the saying that quitting smoking is easy, but staying quit is difficult. After leaving the center, you must swear not to smoke again. As the saying goes, "[all things before are like yesterday's death, all things after are like today's birth]." Wu Xiaohou, Sun Shanjun, Wei Wuchou, Wang Huishan, Zhu Tianren, and others spoke about the harm of smoking, which wastes time, causes unemployment, strains the mind, and damages finances. Moreover, it violates the government's ban on opium. They strongly urged that after leaving the center, they must never smoke again and must cut themselves off from people. The quitters unanimously raised their hands to express their support and vowed to lift their spirits, turn over a new leaf, and reform. Then, a photograph was taken and the ceremony ended.</p>

<h3 id="e61">With Difficulties in Resources, the An Old Home Urgently Needs Assistance <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Target: 5,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Time: November 10th.</p>
<p>Collection Point: Social Services Department of this Newspaper.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Old Age Home has been struggling to operate for over forty years, and its outstanding reputation has aroused widespread sympathy from people in the community. The home has four large dining halls where the elderly eat their meals. Tables and chairs are arranged, and the nuns personally supervise the meals, which are served in order. The order is impeccable. In the past, when prices were low, they could afford meat in addition to vegetables, about three times a week. Recently, prices have been rising rapidly, and donations have been decreasing. They can now only afford meat once a week. Even this meat is collected from the vegetable market every day, accumulated for seven days, and then served for one day's meal. This hardship is evident. Therefore, the nuns in the home accept donations from all sectors of society. Even a bowl of porridge or a shred of silk is never easily discarded. Those who visit the Old Age Home and see how they cherish resources can all attest to this.</p>
