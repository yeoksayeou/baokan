<p>社評</p>
<h3>我們需要政治家</h3>
<p>最近二十年來，中國政府的政治負責者，缺乏的是具有準確政治見解的政治家，過剩的是沒有準確政治見解的政客。因此，逐漸形成植黨營私，四分五裂，貪污輩出，民不聊生的現象。誠是中國民生的不幸，國家復興前途的不幸。</p>
<p>政治家，並不是先天生成的，與生俱來的。孟子說：「天將降大任於是人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身，行拂亂其所爲，所以動心忍性，增益其所不能」。這是說能負大任的人物，意志與能力須從平素磨練得來，是後天培養成功的。可是，現在的政治負責者，似乎先天生成的，祇須懂得鑽營，識得門略，或者依靠背景，就可進身官階，趾高氣揚，不可一世。在上者如此，在下者亦然，級級引進，蔚成風氣，良非偶然。曾國藩說：「風俗之厚薄奚恃乎，繋於一二人之心嚮而已。」誠然，政治風氣的良否，繋於政治家與政客的心嚮者極鉅。</p>
<p>然則，怎樣是現代的政治家呢？</p>
<p>第一，他必須重守信義，取信於人民，取信於國際。發布政令，愼重於事先，考慮周密。旣行之後，嚴格執行，不受任何牽制所影響，是爲重守信義。</p>
<p>第二，他能爲人民謀福利。有「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」的氣概。凡與人民福利有益者，必殫精竭慮以促成之。凡與人民福利有害者，也必殫精竭慮以排除之。有「民饑己饑，民溺己溺」的胸懷，茍有只任，爲人生解饑拯溺，即爲自己彌救過失。</p>
<p>第三，他對於用人，採取唯才主義，大公無私，知人善用。眞有才具能稱職位者，私人可用，即反對者，亦可引用。純以政治效率着想，應有此種態度與容量，這是大公無私。如果用人不問才具，而惟私惟親：或抱具同鄉觀念，地域觀念；或物以類聚，因私利而相互結合者，都是「用人唯私」的作風，決不是政治家所應有的。在用人之先，必須詳考其人的長處與短處，用其所長，容其所短，務使才稱其職，這是「知人」。知人之後，就須信任愛護，考察其的確是人才，尤須特別珍惜，付以全權，使之安心盡職，這是「善用」。</p>
<p>第四，他有深謀遠見。對於國家，對於民族前途，預作十年，甚至五十年一百年的打算，有遠大的理想，有實現的抱負，從遠處着眼，從近處入手。理想的計劃面面顧到，眼前的實踐脚踏實地。</p>
<p>其次，政治家需要豐富的專門的知識與經騐，尤其是當然之事。試問中國的現狀，是否需要政治家領導政治？是否需要政治家變革風氣？以至於改善民生？復興國家?當然需要而且暗絕對需要的。</p>
<p>凡是未具備上述條件的政治負責者，是政客，而非政治家。因爲政客慣用欺騙手段施諸民衆，所以得不到民衆的信仰，最後必然失敗，這是無可置疑的事。</p>

<h3>日靑木大臣　交歡廣播詞　中日團結建設東亞</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　三十日爲國府還都紀念日，日靑木大東亞相特於是日下午七時二十分，與國府褚外交部長滿洲國李外交大臣間，作交歡廣播，其大意如次：吾人回顧東亞歷史，即知英美侵略主義，自鴉片戰爭以來，即從事侵犯中國之獨立自由，蠻食其經濟，並利用一切手段，謀使中國成爲彼等之奴隸，蓋中國若淪爲殖民地，實足以使日本之存立陷於危殆，故當時日本即深感非根本排除英美之侵略勢力，無以消彌日本之危殆，故當時日本曾欲聯合中日兩國，以就會英美勢力，然而終因英美妨害，未能實現，故日本爲對抗英美之跳　，乃不得不在中國方面採取自衛上所必需之對策，然日本之眞意，時受中國方面之誤解，遂演成不幸之中日事變，此使吾人極感遺憾。中國有識之士旱認識及此，汪精衛閣下當時即決意以中日之和平，挽救中國，保衛東亞，並於四年前之今日，國民政府還都南京，自是以來，國民政府即在汪主席領導下，强化國內體制，實施各項施策，以謀自强，並從事培養實力，使中國成爲一近代國家，吾人於此對國民政府之苦心與努力，謹致深切之敬意。另一方面世界情勢其間已有一大轉變，蓋英美支援之渝方，使其繼續抗戰，並加强對日壓迫，故日本爲自存自衛計，乃毅然　起對英美宣戰，決定將英美之侵略勢力，驅出東亞，而國民政府亦於三十二年一月，對英美布吿宣戰，與日本同盟，以抵抗共同之敵人，時至今日，中日兩國已恢復其本然之姿態，而實現其眞正之提携，日本於中國參戰後，日本更協力中國收回租界，撤廢治外法權，兩國更於去年十月締結中日同盟條約，確立兩國永久之友好關係基礎，此在兩國國交史上實劃一新紀元。今東亞之局面已爲之一變，中日兩國乃至處於英美侵略勢力下之東亞各國今已一致蹶起，站在擊滅英美之共同戰綫矣。又去年十一月向中外發表之大東亞共同宣言，實爲東亞民族團結一致之表現，而驅逐英美之侵略勢力，解放東亞，建設東亞人之東亞，此雖非易事，然吾人確信吾人茍能以吾人之堅決信念，吾人不屈不撓之努力，以及吾人之團結，將必能完成建設東亞之偉業，吾人於此尤痛感大東亞中核之中日兩國政府及其國民之責任，今後益趨重大。</p>

<h3>汪主席訓詞全文</h3>
<p>國民政府自從二十九年三月三十日還都迄今，已經是整整的四年了。在過去四年當中，由於我們自己不斷的努力，和盟邦日本眞誠的協助，按照我們當初所預期而實現的事情，固然很多，而未能如願達到，尙有待於我們繼續努力的也正不少。我敢確信，祇要我們舉國上下一心一德，本着旣往一貫的精神，脚踏實地，加倍努力下去，有始有終，奮發前進，中國一定有復興的一天，東亞也一定有光明的一天。</p>
<p>中日必須心靈結合</p>
<p>在這四年當中。我們單就中·日關係調整一點來說，已經有了非常明朗的開展，尤其最近的一年多，中·日兩國益趨緊密協力，成爲保衛東亞戰陣上生死與共的伙伴。我曾經說過，中·日兩國應該做到心靈的結合，這絕非是一種空泛的想像，現在事實已經擺在眼前，從前有些人懷疑日本的態度，以爲他對中國有着領土的野心，懷著滅亡中國的企圖，這些懷疑到現在已一步一步的消釋了。一年多以來，不但日本在中國的租界交還了。幷且由於日本的協力，連其他各國在華的租界也先後交還了，同時治外法權也予以撤廢。去年十月三十日，日本更依據對華新條約廢止，完全本着東方道義精神，和我們簽訂中·日同盟條約，這種平等互惠的盟約，不用說，在東亞外交史上是前所未見的。中·日同盟條約上明確約定，戰爭一旦停止，日本立刻撤兵，並且連從前條約上所規定的駐兵權也放棄了，從這些誠意看來，顯而易見，盟邦日本不但沒有滅亡中國之意向，反之，是具有援助中國復興的決心，是需要中國共同　求東亞的繁榮。中·日兩國，上自政府，下至人民，如果都能循着這條路綫走去，那麼兩國心靈的結合，定然可以做到，永久的和平也就不難成功。</p>
<p>兩國奠定道義基礎</p>
<p>中日友好旣已奠定下如此道義的基礎，同時大東亞各民族間的關係，也有着劃時期的躍進，去年大東亞會議的舉行，大東亞共同宣言的發表，東亞民族友情之增進，意志之團結，行動之密切，已經是鐵一般的事實。國父孫結果先生當日倡導大亞洲主義，盼望東亞民族聯合起來，創建亞細亞洲繁榮的新天地，這種遠大的理想，從前有些人有爲不易實現，現在大家顯然已經向着這個目標共同邁進了。</p>
<p>綜觀過去，還都四年來的內外情勢，我們的努力，可謂幷非虛擲，盟邦的協助，亦非徒然。但我們絕不能以這些成就深爲自滿，因爲中國旣然是亞洲的一環，東亞現在正面臨到生死的關頭，大東亞戰爭已經進入決戰的階段，中國全體的自由獨立解放，還待大東亞戰爭勝利的結果來決定，所以中國的毅然參戰，是自己求生，共同求存的意向，是歷史所昭示的大道。何況戰爭勝利的結果，絕非僥倖可得，我們非以堅定的信念，按着不易的方針努力做去不可。只有拿出具體的力量，　能够把握大東亞戰爭的勝利，中國自由獨立解放，　得成功。</p>
<p>那麼我們應該怎樣努力呢，今年元旦，我已經明白說過，一是「肅正思想」，一是「保障治安」，一是「增加生產」，今年是總力決戰年，所謂總力決戰，就是動員全國的人力，物力，去爭取戰爭的勝果，所以我又說過，增加生產應該是今年三大工作重點中之重點，如今再就此點補充兩句。</p>
<p>羣策羣力增加生產</p>
<p>有人以爲增加生產只是技術的工作，應該是農民與工人的責任，這種觀念根本是不完備的，增加生產不只是技術的工作，也不只是農民與工人的責任，是每一個國民都應該盡的責任，都能够做的工作。比方說，學生可以從勞動服務中協助增產，可以利用假期成空暇到民間去宣傳和策導增產的工作，更可以將研究所得，指導農民技術上的改良　人可以盡量獻出自己的財力，投資開闢農塲創辦工廠，從事必需物資之增產，更可以從新商業道德的倡導中，革除一切足以妨害生產的障礙，兵士可以防範盜匪的侵擾，確保地方治安，使農人安於耕種，維護水陸交通，使運輸得以順利，更可以盡其可能，從事屯墾的工作，婦女也可以從事家庭手工業，以彌補工廠生產之不足，也可以到農村去，幫助農忙，這都是極淺近的道理，所以說，增加生產是要不分老幼，不分職業，羣策羣力，共促其成的國民運動。戰時的國家，沒有不感到物資缺乏的難苦的，然而從事怨天尤人，無補實際，要想從速補救，唯有努力增產，還有一點，增生加產，不祇是要解決日常生活的必需，同時要獲得戰爭上充分的供應，因爲國家在此戰爭時期，不得不把大量的物資，儘先運用到國防上去，國民生活之艱苦，非但難以避免，而且需要大家共同來克服。政府今年召開過增產會議，商討有關增產根本方策，乃至導引游資從事必備品之生產，取締囤積，管理物價，以求民生之安定，並且擬訂人民開採煤礦辦法，鼓勵人民自動投資開發種種措施，要皆按照旣定計劃積極推展。</p>
<p>掃除毒氛復興經濟</p>
<p>增產是全國民衆一體應負的責任，又是需要大家脚踏實地做去的工作，因此我們對於國民體力之培養，國民精神之振發，對於社會　惡之澄清，戰時生活之肅正，不得不予以深切之重視，政府最近實行禁烟淸毒，其大旨亦即在此。</p>
<p>關於烟毒禍國害民的事實，婦孺皆知，百餘年來，因爲英帝國主義的惡勢力盤踞東亞，鴉片毒品之蔓延，　遍佈於全中國境內，經它一手殺害的國民，眞是無可計算，經它一手造成的罪惡，更是擢髪難數。民國二十四年，中國政府曾經頒佈五年禁烟辦法，執行以後，頗爲收效，後來因事變發生，陷於停頓，現在政府繼續過去禁烟計劃，限期三年禁絕，禁種禁運禁吸三方面同時並進，務期毒氛早日滌蕩無餘，民族健康之恢復，國民體力之增强，精神生活之肅正，當可立待。</p>
<p>增加生產的最大目的，是協助完遂大東亞戰爭，同時又是致力復興中國的經濟建設，政府悉心規劃，積極拓展，民衆也應該相與奮起合力推行。</p>
<p>肅淸貪污取締奸商</p>
<p>所以在政府方面所在官吏，惟有以身作則，在社會方面，全體民衆惟有身體力行，因此我們對於有貪污行爲的官吏，絕不寬容姑息，對於擾亂金融的商展，也絕不坐視放縱這類腐蝕政治的惡菌與破壞民生的罪犯。在承平時期，固然不容其存在，在戰爭時期，尤須剷除廓淸，貪污一日不懲，　　制度無以建立，奸商一日不除，國民生計無以改善，政府對嚴懲貪污與取締奸商，已具有最大決心，此後，凡是貪污賣職的政府官吏或目無法紀的歹徒，政府絕不徇情袒護，民衆亦須認真檢舉，以　徹底澄淸。我們今後　做的事情，還不止上面所說的數端，但是，這都是我們應該積極做起來趕速完成的最緊要的工作，盼望我全國民衆與政府同僚，誓以最大的決心，按一致的步　向前邁進。</p>

<h3>黨訓圑首屆畢業禮　陳院長代汪兼圑長訓詞</h3>
<p>（績昨日第二版）</p>
<p>新國民運動，爲我中華民族起死回生之唯一良業，經一年來之倡導推仃，現則機構已普施全國，運動已振起全民，在新因民運動　要中，關於實行三民主義之着重點，言之綦詳，亦即昭示我全黨　員，必先舉行。</p>
<p>茲有特別提示者即綱要第四項中所言：「要倡導公而忘私的精神，個人於國家貢獻要多，享受要少，平日嗇己以裕國家，臨難則贜牲一已以救國家，」此爲和平建國之精神，亦即復興民族之精神，本黨黨員如不首先奉行，則所言建國，所言革命，所言復興中華，保衛東亞，均屬空言。我國自有史以來，變亂相乘，文化停滯，即公而忘私之精神未能昻揚，民國紀元以還」，自袁世凱稱帝，軍閥互鬨，以至共匪之騷擾，蔣氏之割據，何一而非以私爲光志一念爲厲之階，故今日欲建立。一現代國家，欲奠定東亞永久和平之基礎，首先要人人有公而忘私之精神，方京負荷起時代之重任，試署黨員中之頹廢不振者，思想動搖者，行動乖謬者，甚至有極少數一反本黨一打倒貪官汚吏土豪劣紳」之口號，而自甘爲貪官汚吏土豪劣紳，而自甘爲革命之對象者的，因只知個人主義不知公而忘私之大義，只知利用黨及國家之職權，不知個人對於國家有犧牲一切之義務，本黨黨員爲推行新國民運動之中堅，即應爲新國民之模範，對於公而忘私之精神，自應事事奉行，無違救中國保東亞此爲正道。</p>
<p>大東亞各國，本着獨立自由中之要求。一致向大東亞共存共榮之大道邁進，因爲不確守共存共榮之大道，則各國之獨立自由，自雖得確切之保障。總理遣　曾言，世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬭，規在盟邦日本對於我國之協力，如最近之交還租界，撤廢治外法權，幷以互惠平等的地位，結成中日同盟，其助我愛我之熟意，已超出平等待我之上。本黨黨員，自應領導全國民衆，本互尊互助，相親相愛之義，實行各愛其國，互愛其邦，共愛東亞，一致努力，爲東亞歷史上創新紀元。回　中日和平，是中日兩國有志之士提倡於前。中臼兩國人民景從以後，始得有今日績誠合作之現象，而現時正在進行中之大東亞戰爭，關係大東亞十萬萬民族之前途，尤爲重大。盟邦日本，獨立發動於前，我中華民國奪力　起於後，在勝利愈近，　難愈多之決戰階段，戰局卽極緊張，事態未容稍　，本黨黨員，首應總奪起，昂揚大無畏之革命淨勝，幷領導全國民眾，一致總舊起，發揮大中華民族之偉大力量，集中一切人力和一切物力，一點一滴，都貢獻於戰爭，同甘共苦，同生共死，一面求大東亞各民族之共存共榮，一面建設一個新的現代的中華民國，完成本然「求中國之自由平等」的使命。</p>
<p>諸同志爲國家成熟人才，爲本黨中堅幹部，此次由全國各批調集來京，經過六星期之嚴格訓練，及中　各長官之　切訓導益趨鑒定，對世界大局之益趨堅定，對世界大局之認識，益加明瞭，諸同志結衆後，多數各回本職，必能本此精神，一致總舊起，完成新時代之新使侖，臨別贈言，希共勉之。（完）</p>

<h3>南北通貨限制放寬　聯鈔黑市消滅</h3>
<p>中央　備銀行爲取締聯鈔黑促進華中北問物資資金之交，自本月二十七日起，禁止各金　機關經營中儲券對聯鈔兌換買賣，幷指定中國交通等九家墓商銀行及正金朝鮮兩家日商銀行辦理華北匯兌，每客戶每日匯款以五千元爲最憲限額，以便利正當商人交易。同時財政部亦將前規定旅客由華中往華北携帶中儲券一千元限制，改爲每人可携帶五千元，是以往返華中華北商人携帶通貨限制，大爲寬限，且可自由向指定之十一家銀行匯款，聯鈔黑市活動已立時停頓，中儲刻進行向錢莊業調查以一百元對十八元比率收回聯鈔，故此後聯鈔黑　無形消滅，中儲券對聯鈔百元與十八元比率，堅持不動云。</p>
<h3>各保險公司　依法辦理增資　總額達一萬九千餘萬元</h3>

<h3>特魯克羣島　日海軍航空部隊戰記</h3>
<p>敵軍自侵攻馬紹爾諸島以來，虎視耽耽，窺覷日本的內南洋，即於二月十七日晨以戰艦，航空母艦爲基幹之機　部隊，反　擊特魯克羣島，日陸海軍加以邀擊，展開慘烈戰事。結果擊沈敵巡洋艦兩艘，擊毀航空母艦一艘，軍艦一艘，擊落飛機五十四架，以下爲是役的戰記。</p>
<h3>敵方空襲消息傳來</h3>
<p>「敵有力機動部隊出現卡羅林羣島東方。」這個消息傳來以後，接着敵機反覆空襲特魯克島的　報飛來，這時候灼熱的太陽，正在根據地的天空中。日海軍航空部隊基地，刻不容緩，下命攻擊隊準備啓飛，於是上午○○時，經過幾次戰鬥的○○上尉指揮的觸接隊踴躍起飛了。次即載着魚雷的某中尉指揮之攻擊隊○架起樂。上午○時○分，由觸接機打來觸接敵軍的雷波，謂敵有力機動部隊，乃以航空母艦三艘爲基幹，擁有戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦二十數艘。位置在特魯克東方○○連，及進路，速力·隊伍等接連地報吿而來，攻擎隊準其報吿，飛到正確的戰塲去。太陽在南洋是很快去西沈，太陽沈沒在水平綫下的時候，觸接機因爲燃斜吿罄，打了最後的無綫電向基地飛去，然後只有若干架的編隊，托寄生命於指南針和地圖，作着夜間的盲目飛行。飛翔達若干時間，已經飛到預料攻擊處的海上。在沒有月亮，只有星光之下，隊伍密切的攻擊隊，全員的眼睛圓睜得像一般的大，凝視着海面，一物都不肯把它放過的</p>
<h3>向獵物猛襲</h3>
<p>午後○時○分·果然發見着敵機動部隊，那是敵機動部隊的一羣，巡艦十艘以上，好像擁着航空母艦三艘一般，在夜的海上，黑黑地排着縱隊航行着。推量其速度有十六節，立刻命令突擎，於是分開隊伍的攻擊隊，準向着航空母艦加以襲擊，敵方還未射擊，在距離若干米突的地點，先由某中尉的指揮官機投下魚　，魚　果然中著一艘敵艦，敵艦仍火焰包住然後深沒海中，由艦型推察看，是大型的巡洋艦。此艘大型巡洋艦因爲看到航空母艦危殆，即作高速度的形駛，擔任保　航空母艦的側面，而被擊沉的。雖然上敵軍，其行動也值得稱讚。魚雷投下之　，敵全部艦隊、開始打出猛烈的砲火，是何等悽烈的砲火呀！紅、靑、黃的色彩好像虹一樣的曳光彈，縱橫交加，緊追着日機。這時候指揮官機以下蒙受敵彈數枚，但終於能够脫出虎口了。比這早一點，某飛曹長指揮的二次機、奉了全部突擊的命令，聳立機　的　間，看見鉅大的敵艦迫在咫尺之間，使沒有瞬息的躊躇，抱住魚雷向敵艦冲擊去，而實行自炸。敵艦即被隆隆的炸聲和火焰　住。經過數分鐘之後。日一次　偵察了附近的海面，但敵艦已沈人海中。看不見其形骸了。「很可惜的，如果能够再攻擊一次，那麼戰果更要擴大呢。」返到基地的某中尉，開口第一聲這樣說着。</p>
<h3>燃料高罄</h3>
<p>敵機動部隊現在仍在覬覦特魯克的周團、斷續地實行寧襲，地自司令官以下無論那一個的臉十都浮現着悲痛的怒色，顧慮着友軍的危急，一架也好希望飛機增多，如果有飛機，這次便是一舉可以擊滅敵大艦隊的絕好機會。早晨○時○○分，觸接攻擊機○架出發·再經過兩點鐘以後，前天某中尉指揮的攻擊機起飛，攻擊隊的飛機比前天還少，只有○架而巳。以寡勢而將對敵大羣中，實行快戰的突擊，要瞻仰這種日海軍飛機的不屈精神，令人不無流淚。出發後已過若干時，觸接機的燃料將全部吿罄的時候，再發見敵機動大部隊在特魯克島東方○○哩。報吿攻擊隊，但可惜燃料將盡，不得不全部返防，這已是深更的時候了。某某根據地，除對於當前的敵機反覆攻擊以外並預料最嚴重的時機，非鞏固根據地的防備不可。攻擊隊出發之後，哨戒索敵機，曾出動數次，根據地也充滿着緊張的情緒。是日下了驟雨，因爲天氣不佳，口遠距離哨戒機一架，尙不見返防，在嚴密實行燈火管制的飛機塲，於明滅的標示燈之下，陸上的警備員站立着待着那一架飛機返來，但終於不見影踪了。</p>
<h3>再度向敵襲擊</h3>
<p>今天又在未明的時候，索敵機向天空中衝飛上去。這一天天氣仍是惡劣，海上垂滿着斷雲，視界殆不能淸楚，不見敵艦，於午後○時，空自飛返而來。迨至黃昏，接着發見敵船團在某某島附近的報吿，爲着要在夜間實施攻擊，是夜更深，攻擊隊便帶着魚雷踴躍上了征路。是夜因有星光，正向戰塲速飛的中途。在○○島西景，但這一架因為蒙受子彈，終於犧牲了。其餘全部陸續對敵艦投下至近的炸彈，但因為在夜間，不能看見戰果，即以速力　退。敵格拉曼　　織　架，早已察知日機的攻擊，緊迫日機而來，然而終於被日機擊退，○時安然返到基地。（弘譯自三月五日　　報知）</p>

<p>富　進店的第一天，也就是擇吉拜師的日子。輝煌的一斤燭，站在繫着紅緞布的長桌的二端，有人用竹筷時而鉗去焦黑的燭心，浸放在冷水椀裘，吱的一聲。</p>
<p>滿屋子人漾溢者欣喜，正中的一把太師椅下安置着一塊三尺兄方的紅　毯。慮頭人頻頻邀請着老闆出來，富根也就在後面尾隨着。</p>
<p>拜了，拜先生了！」孩子們新奇地嚷。</p>
<p>老闆總沒有三秒鐘端坐在太師椅上，給　頭人好容易按下了，又萬分讓　的向一旁進讓，這樣總算受了必恭必敬的三　頭。於是順手推一推頭上的瓜皮帽，很溫和的向　頭人說：</p>
<p>「他呌富根吧？今天不必故事情的。譬如鋪蓋分：「全面」「三全」「頂極」等等花樣，記記也好。或者都從明天起頭吧！其餘的事喂！「說者就招呼了正在揀黑棗的頭　（註）一聲，應頭人明白其餘的事當然只問頭櫃好了。所以未待老闆向頭櫃說完指點指點富根的話，已連連到他說拜託。</p>
<p>薦頭人又鄭車的叮囑了富根二句，這纔吿辭。老闆說：</p>
<p>「下樓去吧！」</p>
<p>富根隨着衆人下樓，店堂間望望一都是陌生面孔，他的二手雖然空着，苦於無從下手，老闆說不用做事情，要做也何由做起呀！至於舖蓋，老早就整理好啦！再說記記貨名種別，却有些字不識，有些物品連見都從未見過，譬如像較豆略大且硬的那般東西，呌做：「淡菜」即使天才也記不牢的。</p>
<p>他揰着二手，瞟瞟眼無聊賴的張望着，一陣買主去了，又來一陣，店夥們像穿梭似的忙着。眞的，秤啦，斧頭包啦，三角紙包啦，在他看來委實此天書都難弄的。不由心裏有些兒恐懼，幹嗎撈什子的花樣那末多？</p>
<p>想着想着，一　眼倒瞧見一在櫃角依着「鐵絲遮」疊得高高的柿餅，旣粉白父柔韌，不禁記起鄕問媽媽對他說過的一句話：</p>
<p>「在南貨店裏學生意，甜的鹹的都有吃。」</p>
<p>他挨挪過去，咽着　涎，一邊望望老闆，只看見光亮亮的禿一頭，正在那裏寫帳呢？但他終不敢，</p>
<p>富根，過來！」</p>
<p>老闆閑閑的喝一聲，富根驚惶者訕訕的移到帳毫邊，下意識地右指頭不住的在背後拭着。老闆指了一張紅格子的帳單上的數字：</p>
<p>一算算看，這筆帳，一</p>
<p>眞像鄕下關亡魂用的符咒，一圈兒又二捺，幸虧這種碼子字，自己倒還學過。勉强的依數打在算盤珠上，口裏喃喃地說：</p>
<p>「三一三十一」，……六退一下還…」</p>
<p>「第一的！老闆彎着食指桌角上一敲，一邊用左手改正了算盤上的錯訛，搖搖頭：「嘖嘖！連減法都督不來！」</p>
<p>富根防着一篤一的會敲到額角上來，很窘的站在一旁，店堂裏輕微的一陣笑，他睨眼去看時，夜飯巳開出了，一菜一湯，飯碗高高的疊着，那個比他資格略老的學徒，正在向他笑，富根苦笑前臉，不知所云，老闆看着就推他道：「嗯！打飯去，靈活些！」</p>
<p>飯後，老闆又把他叫了來，吩咐他說：一到這裏學生意，要吃得起苦。早晨六點起來，打算盤，學秤，寫字，不許偷懶。七點開牌門，然後，泡水掃地，水草繩亂了，整理整　，零碎買賣。隨使做做，譬如油豆一元一包，油王二元一包。中晚飯時要伺候者，打烊時，裏外收拾淸楚。對店友要和氣，懂嗎？</p>
<p>富根點點頭，出來了，依着櫃台站着。晚上的生意很冷落，頭願搖頭擺耳在那裏打着三角紙包，是預備明早應市的一元一包的油豆。</p>
<p>不一會，又是一聲吆喝、打烊了，絡續的出去揹牌門板，富根也吃力的措了一塊。進來時，頭櫃倒拿着鉛筆在灰報紙上醫裸體女人，嘴裏呀呀學唱。忽然立起來，隨手取了枚甘貝，一絲一絲的嚼着，拖着鞋到樓上去了。</p>
<p>臨睡時，那個學徒還拍拍他的背說：「我們是朋友啦！你的舖放在我的旁邊吧！」</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>
<p>「明早我送貨很忙，棧房裏的一方鹼水，你有空拿把斧頭去敲碎了，車了來！」富根沒有答，什麼鹼水，送貨，他懂也不懂，一個思念掠過，」起伏着—柿餅，百數元袋裏一塞，裸體女人……明日是什麼日子？</p>
<p>他兀自胡思亂想，踵不着，　敲二時了！</p>
<p>（註）頭櫃：老闆以下，高於一般夥友者，相當於新式店鋪之所謂　理</p>
<h3>我愛旅行</h3>
<p>— 程巨蓀</p>
<p>我愛旅行，</p>
<p>永遠地旅行。</p>
<p>我要在旅行中磨鍊，</p>
<p>也要在旅行中長成！</p>
<p>我踱過　枯的沙漠，</p>
<p>更越過　山峻嶺。</p>
<p>迅雷閃電　不退我底勇氣，</p>
<p>狂風暴雨阻不住我底前進。</p>
<p>我底有念是：</p>
<p>黑暗的後面，</p>
<p>仍舊是光明！瞧啊！</p>
<p>這邊是崎嶇的山路，</p>
<p>那邊是流水的盡頭。聽啊！</p>
<p>前面有蟒蛇在蠕動，</p>
<p>後面有豺狼在追踪。可是我仍然向前走。我並不因此而停滯，也不囚此而畏縮。我底信念是：艱難的後面便是成功的大路！</p>
<h3>語絲</h3>
<p>— 儀宜</p>
<p>眞正的友情，不是你歡樂時聽到的愉悅的笑語，也不是你得志時領受的動聽的祝辭：它是你失意時的同情和援助，徬徨時的鼓勵和指示，在午聽的刹那，是刺耳的，令人難堪的，甚至上可憎厭的；然而當你遭到了波折或失敗後，你就會感到它的價値是何等的可貴而崇高。</p>
<p>站在正義的立塲，用正直的精神，反抗任何不合理的一切，但是記主，正義的立場是建設，不是破壤；是改造，不是毀滅；因此即使你捉到了一個惡賊，雖然　口曉曉　處之死地，你還是設法給他一個新年的機會。</p>
<p>坦白是消弭朋友間誤會的最好方法，無席顧到人們是否諒解你，擬　這滌淸你的心胸，不剩一點渣滓；是非曲直終有分明的一天；但是，坦白不是吹噓，不是貼佈告；是誠實的行動的表現。鮮歷入時的衣服，日久了，就要污穢和破烟；嬌媚婉　的容貌，隨著歲月的飛逝會衰老和醜陋；少女們！莫憂慮你的裝束失了時，更無　怔仲你的髪將禿，額將皺；把　影自憐的光陰，核向道德的修養上，學問的進取上；唯有它們才能使你的生命，永遠年靑，永遠美麗。</p>

<h3>東僑激戰展至本周舉行　再論義將變相之僑聯　知己知彼百戰百勝</h3>
<p>東華對僑聯之戰，爲足聯會第二循環最精彩之幕，原定上星期日在逸園會師，不幸天不作美，春雨綿綿，乃展至本星期日上午十時半仍在逸園交鋒。上期本刋已載抽作，略談東華應取之攻守策略，聊足以助於東華。茲乘此展期間內，再作論義將變相之僑聯隊，所以知敵之長，攻敵之短，乃能百戰百勝也，亦補上文之不足。</p>
<h3>典型歐陸球派</h3>
<p>將戰術是典型歐陸足球派，此派之特點爲出脚快，賴乎體力之足，用長傳。進攻方式是分散式，中堅或兩前衛得球，大多傳遞兩翼。由此直入，逼近敵門區域，而作攻門之機會，一切均在敏捷中進展。該隊全係此種方式，頗有成就。更可懼者，津來大將奥托尼洛之中堅，其頭頂功夫，可在後半塲。直頂傳兩翼，神出鬼沒，難能可貴。中路三鋒，不取竄勢，用强硬之脚頭在二十碼左右即行攻門，大刀關斧，兇險異常·其主守時除五衛退後外，兩內鋒亦立即退。後以七個衛之能力，跟緊皮球，隨球而衝。此項踢法，非有充沛之長力不可。而該隊　屬個個壯碩，其最初五分鐘之精神，與最後五分鐘之努力，毫無異樣。</p>
<h3>缺點抵能用力</h3>
<p>義將之缺點為全隊抵能用力，而不善用智。前鋒進攻，硬來硬去。後衛固守，勇猛追球。如此破其進攻之硬，應利用地位之站好，以及阻其必然不易之出脚當有成效。而破其守衛之猛，祇須多作三角小傳遞，使其窮於奔命，雖其長力驚人，亦必爲之亂得一團糟也。况東華本善於此，故切忌利用長傳，正中義將胃口。極宜多作花巧敏捷之小傳遞，我料彼必縛手縛脚也。致華隊要取攻門，務須用烟幕射，二鋒以上同時竄進時，應讓後者射，前者用烟幕擋衛，並使門將之捉摸不定，撲救無及，庶幾有成。</p>
<h3>義軍陣綫排定</h3>
<p>至逐一論義軍區別，則門將麥尼蒂羅蒂為滬上第一第二之守門。內衛羅旭萊較麥契蒂爲穩，均勇敢過人。如敵將用智盤過時，必亟返身窮追。中衛綫上，將爲滬上最標準。蓋奥托尼洛，本爲遠東第一中堅。身材魁梧，有六尺以上之高度。善快遞球出有路，其頭上功夫超上一等，與足上本領，並焉齊驅。而左右兩前衛雪維太西拉蒂，均爲面面俱到之準中衛人材·奥未蒞滬時，例有此二人担任中堅。迺者大材小用，勝任有餘，焉有不成功之理·故其中衛綫之强，與其守門之特出並稱雙絕。前鋒綫上，泰克尼本爲左內鋒上駟之材，此番反主中帥者，因津來將士巴瑪之左內鋒勝於泰克尼。且巴瑪之守功，實高人一等。飽傑之右內鋒，球迷皆知無容多贅。維拉迪盤那之左右兩翼，俱能勾中長傳（翼　翼）外，亦能邊角打門·故總窺全隊人材平均，濟濟多士，此次出塲之陣容，已經該常局公佈·研究之確爲最標準·</p>
<h3>甚願東華努力</h3>
<p>如上所述，對於義將各方面之觀察，或有不逮之處，然不外此界限。筆者所以介紹者，非長他人之氣，正盼東華知己知彼，始能一較而擒也。</p>
<p>臨書至此，可吿結束。唯以寄重於東華者股切，將不憚重複。願我健克，謹記進切忌多盤，利用三角小傳遞。所謂以己之長，攻人之短。守則後衛宜遮住球門區域二十碉以內，不可衝出·張　多作後顧，阿梁還是前助，過於奔馳度致無成·余言盡於此，語簡而意長，已三復我言，不識健兒球迷不謙言多而同情乎？</p>
<p>春宵寒重，筆者作此，甚願不負爾我之同一希望也卒矣！</p>
<h3>最近上海籃球賽中　各球隊攻勢方式（上）　除速進遠外應另採四種突破陣法</h3>
<p>在過去之西靑籃球聯賽中，筆者常爲座上客，滬上各勁旅均一一領敎。各隊球水準很高，最値得稱讀的，是那妙手穿揚的本事·半塲遙射，屢中紅心。雖有馬奇諾那樣的防錢，也不中用。因爲他們用不着衝鋒肉搏，在外面遠射已能取勝。好就好在這一點，但壤也壞在這一點。因遠射是最省力的破敵陣捷徑、所以十記球很少有幾記是衝到籃子旁邊托進去的。如此大家都不考究傳球和切入結果。本埠籃球的攻勢，不是十分的利害。說一句笑話，假若雙方議定長射進的球，均不算結果，籃球記錄要和足球記錄一樣，一比零或三對二了。</p>
<p>全部聯賽中，最精彩的一幕，要算那塲友誼賽，中靑對西靑巨人。用人釘人之防衛，强悍異常。中靑集合華墓聯仁餘汕隊之精銳，那天有高速度的傳球和出神入化的穿揰。在巨人防綫中，來去自由。西靑諸子跟進跟出，一籌莫展。有幾次他們東手無策，望者中靑的人在籃下投籃。</p>
<h3>兩種攻勢方式</h3>
<p>其他各賽中之攻勢，均逃不了下面兩種方式。第一種球一到手，就大家風馳電掣的衝到籃下，在敵隊防綫未曾佈好之先；造成二對一或三對二的優勝局面。這種戰略，呌速進（FastBreak）。過着防守嚴密的球隊，則不能收效。於是有第二種辦法；球過中縷後，就在防綫外面，拋來拋去。如敵衛稍一鬆解，則來一遠射。有時雖有中央突破。直搗黃龍的雄圖。結果很少成爲事實，大半知難而退，球仍回到外面本隊內衛的手裏。來這樣的打法，雖比那種攻守不分，專偷冷飯拍司毫無的籃球進步得多。但未免有點枯燥和沉悶。</p>
<h3>應另採四種破敵陣法</h3>
<p>滬上籃球隊之所以採取這種攻勢者，因各隊除巨人和蒙諾克外，均用地域防衛。我們不可不承認速進和遠射是對付地域防衛的最有效騐之方法，同時，我們不可研究怎樣才能突破這種防綫而衝入敵籃下投籃。這是可能的，祇耍具備下面的條件。</p>
<h3>高速度的傳球</h3>
<p>球到手，即傳出。手要快，多用短傳運球和反單傳球，耽擱時間不可多用。如球停住不動，或傳得太慢。不但不能進攻，而且有被敵衛截奪或逼成爭球的危險。最近本埠的守衛門檻種精，一見敵錄有球在手，則二人齊上，阻撓不讓你在防綫外面拋來拋去或從容投籃·華聯對巨人之役，巨人超前十幾分之多，在終塲幾分鐘」之前，墓聯福至心靈，施用此種戰略，擊破巨人之攻勢，反敗爲勝。</p>
<h3>巧妙的切入</h3>
<p>當本隊球員運球迫近敵人防綫時，其餘四人　用誘敵的方法，擺脫敵衛的監視，切入（Cut）有效地點，接受同伴的傳球。這一點全靠個人的天分感覺靈敏的人，無論何地全塲敵我地位一目了然，並能預料到幾次傳球和穿揰後的局面。如同普通人着棋，看一記着一記。各手則能預測四五記。常見一人得球其餘四人呆若木雞的站在那裏，亦有毫無目的亂跑。這位持球的人，孤立無援，欲拍不能，陷成優局。有時有人切入洽常的地點。縱大聲喊呌，持球的人，也不把球傳過來·這樣前後呼應不靈，首尾不連之球隊，欲加　攻勢，非在切入和傳球上面，下苦功不可。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>中靑所見聞</h3>
<p>中靑目下形勢甲一部以中北大華最佔優勢，墓聯藥巳失敗一次，當屬稍見吃虧耳。甲二部以仁餘佔上風，女子組則以綠隊爲翅首，蓋已除三省華僑二强，所餘二戰，必勝康愛，對大華為唯一之難關矣。唯大華戰三省華僑·未必能操左券。依此而言，綠隊自屬前途樂觀。</p>
<p>女子籃球賽實力相差不多之球賽，甚易有意外之結果·盡每節僅八分鐘，除去跳球（女子賽獨多）等轉　過去，如球運較佳，較弱之隊，　能勝利，故余謂女子賽除非強弱顯明，否則必多冷門。</p>
<p>前啓秀女籃球隊前鋒三劍客張嘉佩嚴蔚雯劉珍寶，目下張已適人，球場上難見芳踪。嚴劉則運袂效勞綠隊，雄風猶昔。嚴球藝日進，體力亦較前充沛，誠爲標準之中鋒人材。劉則反串後衛，演出有聲有色，門檻極精，敵鋒難過其關，珍　眞全材也。</p>
<p>女子籃球仔衛者，出風頭機會較少，始終無投籃機會，不易爲球迷所矚目。唯老於看球者則不然，後衛技術高超者，每能令人眷念不止，如前之陳金釵熹勳周秀珍，以及目下綠隊之王維珍，確有驚人之演出，而建下功動。</p>
<p>華聯藥廠籃球隊主人張溎祥表示，雖不幸敗於東華，然不足介懷·如以後能保持不敗，希望依然濃厚·即使不幸而再敗，則亦何傷·該隊固希望奪得錦標，然寄予精神道德及服從者更重，可爲模偕。</p>
<p>上星期四仁餘戰汕隊之役，仁餘主將余郇子與油隊周斌無意猛撞，余郇子受傷甚重。老余在昏厥時，猶呼「射籃富心」球員精神，値得欽佩·聞余郇子之傷，係撞洛牙齒，以致當時流血昏厥。後送仁濟醫院，目下可吿無碍。下次出戰，又將我裝登塲矣。</p>
<p>女子籃球投籃姿勢最佳者，當推華僑林向志大華黃美娟及綠隊容淑儉，林投籃時身體　起騰空而射，黃在籃底竅進投籃時，跳起時雙足直綫，有如游泳之躍水鏡頭，容則左右開弓，在球脫手之一剎那，身體　過，妙不可言·</p>
<p>有一部分新聞記者組織之天光隊，加入乙組角逐·主將陳成，鶴立鷄羣，演出極有可觀。</p>
<p>逢精彩球賽時必客滿關鐵門，而球迷　　立門外不走，不管永久防空街道黑暗，球迷之精神如此，非我人能想像及也。</p>
<p>球員賽球必有太太陪來者，有馬　希張良雄二位夫人。</p>
<p>中靑門票平時仍售念元，惟星期日因有日夜二塲，將增至四十元，可以連看，球迷仍不吃虧。（梅潔）</p>

<h3>We Need Statesmen</h3>
<p>In the past twenty years, what the political leaders of the Chinese government have lacked is statesmen with accurate political insights, and what they have had in excess is politicians without accurate political insights. As a result, the phenomena of planting party members for personal gain, fragmentation, rampant corruption, and the people living in poverty have gradually formed. This is truly the misfortune of the Chinese people's livelihood and the misfortune of the country's prospects for rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Statesmen are not born that way, not innate. Mencius said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a man, it must first embitter his heart and will, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, empty him of resources, and disrupt his actions. In this way, his heart will be moved, his nature tempered, and his deficiencies supplemented." This means that people who can bear great responsibilities must have their will and ability honed from ordinary times, and they are cultivated and successful through acquired efforts. However, current political leaders seem to be born that way, only needing to know how to scheme and understand the tricks, or rely on connections, to advance in official ranks, strutting and acting as if they are invincible. Those above are like this, and those below are also like this, with each level leading the way, forming a trend, which is by no means accidental. Zeng Guofan said, "What does the thickness of customs depend on? It depends on the inclinations of one or two people's hearts." Indeed, the quality of the political atmosphere depends greatly on the inclinations of the hearts of statesmen and politicians.</p>
<p>So, what is a modern statesman?</p>
<p>First, he must value trustworthiness and faith, gaining the trust of the people and gaining the trust of the international community. When issuing government orders, he must be cautious beforehand and consider them thoroughly. After implementation, he must strictly enforce them, without being influenced by any constraints. This is valuing trustworthiness and faith.</p>
<p>Second, he can seek welfare for the people. He has the spirit of "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying the world's happiness after everyone else." For anything beneficial to the people's welfare, he must exhaust his efforts to promote it. For anything harmful to the people's welfare, he must also exhaust his efforts to eliminate it. He has the compassion of "feeling hungry when the people are hungry, and feeling drowned when the people are drowned." If he has a responsibility to relieve hunger and rescue the drowning for the people, it is to redeem his own faults.</p>
<p>Third, when it comes to employing people, he adopts meritocracy, is impartial and selfless, and knows people and makes good use of them. Those who truly have talent and can be competent in their positions, even private individuals can be used, and even opponents can be employed. Purely considering political efficiency, he should have this kind of attitude and capacity. This is impartiality and selflessness. If employing people does not consider talent, but only private connections and relatives; or embraces the concepts of fellow villagers or regionalism; or gathers people of the same kind and combines for private interests, these are all "employing people based on private interests," which are definitely not what a statesman should have. Before employing people, he must carefully examine the person's strengths and weaknesses, use their strengths, tolerate their weaknesses, and ensure that their talents match their positions. This is "knowing people." After knowing people, he must trust and care for them, and if he is sure that they are talented, he must especially cherish them, give them full authority, and enable them to work with peace of mind and fulfill their duties. This is "making good use of them."</p>
<p>Fourth, he has deep foresight. Regarding the country and the future of the nation, he makes plans for ten, even fifty or a hundred years in advance, has grand ideals, and has the ambition to realize them, looking at the big picture and starting with the present. His ideal plans take everything into account, and his current practice is grounded in reality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, statesmen need rich specialized knowledge and experience, which is especially obvious. May I ask, does the current situation in China need statesmen to lead politics? Does it need statesmen to change the atmosphere? To the extent of improving the people's livelihood? Reviving the country? Of course, it needs it, and it absolutely needs it.</p>
<p>Anyone who does not possess the above conditions as a political leader is a politician, not a statesman. Because politicians are accustomed to using deceptive means on the people, they cannot gain the people's trust, and in the end, they will inevitably fail. This is an unquestionable fact.</p>

<h3>Minister Arita of Japan Delivered a Radio Address on Friendship: China and Japan Unite to Build East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – On the 30th, the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Arita, together with Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government and Foreign Minister Li of Manchukuo, made a radio broadcast of friendship at 7:20 PM. The gist of his remarks is as follows: Looking back at the history of East Asia, we know that Anglo-American aggression, since the Opium War, has been engaged in infringing upon China's independence and freedom, devouring its economy, and using all means to make China their slave. If China were to become a colony, it would indeed endanger Japan's existence. Therefore, at that time, Japan deeply felt that unless the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States were fundamentally eliminated, Japan's danger could not be eliminated. Therefore, at that time, Japan wanted to unite China and Japan to counter the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, but in the end, it could not be realized due to Anglo-American obstruction. Therefore, in order to counter the Anglo-American attack, Japan had no choice but to take necessary self-defense measures in China. However, Japan's true intentions were often misunderstood by China, and the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident was triggered, which makes us feel extremely regretful. People of insight in China recognized this early on. At that time, His Excellency Wang Jingwei decided to save China and defend East Asia through Sino-Japanese peace. And on this day four years ago, the National Government returned to Nanjing. Since then, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the National Government has strengthened the domestic system, implemented various policies to seek self-improvement, and engaged in cultivating strength, making China a modern country. Here, we would like to express our deep respect for the National Government's painstaking efforts and efforts. On the other hand, the world situation has undergone a major change. The Chongqing faction supported by the United Kingdom and the United States continued to resist and intensified its oppression of Japan. Therefore, for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense, Japan resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, determined to drive the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States out of East Asia. And in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the National Government also announced a declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States, allied with Japan to resist the common enemy. Today, China and Japan have restored their original posture and realized their true cooperation. After China participated in the war, Japan assisted China in recovering concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. The two countries also concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in October last year, establishing the foundation for permanent friendly relations between the two countries. This has truly marked a new era in the history of relations between the two countries. Now the situation in East Asia has changed. China and Japan and even all East Asian countries under the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have now risen up together and stood on the common front of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration issued to China and foreign countries in November last year is a manifestation of the unity of the East Asian nations. Although it is not easy to drive out the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, liberate East Asia, and build East Asia for East Asians, we are convinced that if we can use our firm belief, our unyielding efforts, and our unity, we will surely be able to complete the great cause of building East Asia. Here, we especially deeply feel that the responsibility of the governments and people of China and Japan, the core of Greater East Asia, will become even greater in the future.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted a German official war report as saying: The German army has recently withdrawn from the lower reaches of the Ukrainian Bug River to disengage from the enemy, and has not been subjected to pressure from the enemy. The 3rd Mountain Division led by Major General Grotmann and the 17th Infantry Division led by Lieutenant General Borucker have established special merits in the disengagement zone in the past few days. South of Bota (eastern Romanian border) and between the Dniester and Prut rivers, the enemy's large-scale offensive has been intercepted in fierce fighting. South of Borosgulov, fierce fighting with repeated advances and retreats is still in progress. The German army has withdrawn from the Chernovzit (Chernovzit in northern Romania) and Stanslau (Stanslau in southeastern former Polish territory) war zones. The German army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy's vanguard. The heroic German garrison in Tropole, within the former Polish territory, has once again repelled the concentrated offensive of the Soviet army. In the Bolleady war zone, the enemy's attempt to break through the German army's positions failed. The enemy had twenty-seven tanks assisting, and the German army destroyed sixteen of them. The German army in Gofril again repelled the attacking enemy. Northwest of the city, the German army occupied many positions.</p>

<h3>Elite Japanese-Indian Troops Are Advancing Towards Manipur, Fierce Fighting Is Unfolding on the Imphal Plain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base on the Indian front line, Japanese and Indian elite troops, after breaking through the Indian-Burmese border on a large scale, are continuing their attack with the force of a landslide. On the night of the 24th, they had already reached the eastern area of the Imphal Plain, the base of the enemy's Fourth Army, and an unprecedented battle of annihilation in Manipur is about to unfold. On the 24th, at 6:00 PM, strong Japanese and Indian troops reached the high ground 30 kilometers east of Imphal and are continuing their brave attack while overlooking the Manipur Plateau. Another powerful Japanese army is launching an attack on Sangak (40 kilometers east of Imphal), the enemy's largest food supply depot. They launched a fierce attack on the enemy paratroopers who continued to resist desperately in carrying out the work of supplying weapons. On the 24th, they completely occupied the area, seizing a large amount of weapons and food, and have prepared to break into the Imphal Plain in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Yangon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army has been launching fierce air strikes on the enemy paratrooper rescue teams near and north of Kasa, and is cooperating with the Burmese National Army to tighten the encirclement from all sides. On the 27th, a Japanese unit fought them in close combat. The enemy, who was building a position and repairing an airfield about 60 kilometers north of Kasa, suddenly launched a fierce attack at midnight. The enemy held on to a position equipped with barbed wire, resisting stubbornly with mortars and machine guns. The Japanese army overcame the difficulties, seized a corner of it, and attacked into the airfield, destroying ten of its aircraft, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers, and seizing a large amount of weapons and food. They are currently continuing to expand their gains.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to the United Press, citing sources in Delhi, the offensive launched by the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces in the Ukhrul area, 32 kilometers northeast of Imphal, is becoming increasingly fierce. Fierce fighting has unfolded on the Imphal Plain since the morning of the 29th. Although the enemy urgently dispatched a large army to resist with all their might, they have been crushed by the Japanese-Indian army in several places.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Arita, seeing that the independence of India is in sight after the Indian National Army cooperated with the Japanese army to break through the Burmese-Indian border, sent a telegram to Subhas Chandra Bose, the supreme commander of India and chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, on the 29th, to express his congratulations on his bright future.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>It has been a full four years since the National Government returned to the capital on March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic. In the past four years, due to our own continuous efforts and the sincere assistance of our ally Japan, many things have been achieved as we initially expected. However, there are still many things that have not been achieved as desired, and we still need to continue our efforts. I firmly believe that as long as we, as a nation, are of one heart and one mind, adhering to our consistent spirit, being grounded and redoubling our efforts, persevering to the end, and forging ahead with vigor, China will surely have a day of rejuvenation, and East Asia will surely have a day of brightness.</p>
<p>Japan and China Must Have Spiritual Unity</p>
<p>In these four years, we have seen a very clear development in the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations alone. Especially in the past year or so, China and Japan have become increasingly close in cooperation, becoming partners who share life and death on the battlefront of defending East Asia. I once said that China and Japan should achieve spiritual unity. This is by no means a vague imagination. The fact is already before us. Some people used to doubt Japan's attitude, believing that it had territorial ambitions towards China and harbored the intention of destroying China. These doubts have gradually dissipated. In the past year or so, not only have Japan's concessions in China been returned, but also, thanks to Japan's cooperation, the concessions of other countries in China have been returned one after another. At the same time, extraterritorial rights have also been abolished. On October 30th of last year, Japan further abolished the old treaties based on the new Sino-Japanese treaty, and in the spirit of Eastern morality, signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with us. Needless to say, such an equal and mutually beneficial alliance is unprecedented in the diplomatic history of East Asia. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty clearly stipulates that once the war ceases, Japan will immediately withdraw its troops and even give up the right to station troops stipulated in previous treaties. From these sincere intentions, it is evident that our ally Japan not only has no intention of destroying China, but on the contrary, is determined to assist China's rejuvenation and needs China to jointly seek the prosperity of East Asia. If the governments and peoples of China and Japan can follow this path, then the spiritual unity of the two countries can certainly be achieved, and lasting peace will not be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The Two Countries Lay the Foundation of Morality</p>
<p>Since Sino-Japanese friendship has been established on such a moral foundation, the relationship between the nations of Greater East Asia has also made epoch-making progress. The holding of the Greater East Asia Conference last year, the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the increase in friendship among East Asian nations, the unity of will, and the closeness of action are already ironclad facts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China, advocated Pan-Asianism, hoping that East Asian nations would unite to create a new world of Asian prosperity. Some people thought that this grand ideal was not easy to achieve. Now, everyone is clearly moving towards this goal together.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, the internal and external situation in the four years since the return to the capital, our efforts can be said to have not been wasted, and the assistance of our allies has not been in vain either. However, we must never be complacent with these achievements, because China is a link in Asia, and East Asia is now facing a critical juncture of life and death. The Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, and the freedom, independence, and liberation of the entire China are yet to be determined by the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, China's resolute participation in the war is an intention for self-preservation and joint survival, which is the great path shown by history. Moreover, the victory of the war cannot be obtained by chance. We must make efforts with firm belief and according to an unchangeable policy. Only by taking out concrete strength can we grasp the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the freedom, independence, and liberation of China can be achieved successfully.</p>
<p>So how should we work hard? On New Year's Day this year, I clearly stated that the three key areas are "purifying thought", "ensuring security", and "increasing production." This year is the year of total war. The so-called total war is to mobilize the nation's human and material resources to win the victory of the war. Therefore, I also said that increasing production should be the most important of the three major work priorities this year. Now, let me add two more sentences on this point.</p>
<p>Increasing Production Through Collective Efforts</p>
<p>Some people think that increasing production is just a technical work and should be the responsibility of farmers and workers. This view is fundamentally incomplete. Increasing production is not just a technical work, nor is it just the responsibility of farmers and workers. It is the responsibility that every citizen should fulfill and the work that everyone can do. For example, students can assist in increasing production through labor service, they can use holidays and free time to go to the countryside to promote and guide the work of increasing production, and they can even use their research results to guide farmers in technical improvements. People can contribute their financial resources as much as possible, invest in developing farms and establishing factories, and engage in the production of essential materials. They can also eliminate all obstacles that hinder production through the advocacy of new commercial ethics. Soldiers can prevent the invasion of bandits, ensure local security, so that farmers can cultivate the land in peace, maintain water and land transportation, so that transportation can be smooth, and they can also engage in reclamation work as much as possible. Women can also engage in household handicrafts to make up for the lack of factory production, and they can also go to the countryside to help with farm work. These are all very simple truths. Therefore, increasing production is a national movement that requires the concerted efforts of everyone, regardless of age or occupation. A country at war cannot but feel the hardship of a lack of materials. However, engaging in complaining is of no practical use. To remedy the situation as soon as possible, the only way is to work hard to increase production. Another point is that increasing production is not only to solve the necessities of daily life, but also to obtain a sufficient supply for the war. Because during this period of war, the country has to prioritize a large amount of materials for national defense. The hardship of the people's lives is not only difficult to avoid, but also requires everyone to overcome it together. The government convened a production increase meeting this year to discuss fundamental policies related to production increase, as well as guiding idle funds to engage in the production of essential goods, cracking down on hoarding, managing prices, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, and drafting measures for people to mine coal, encouraging people to invest in development. All kinds of measures should be actively promoted in accordance with the established plan.</p>
<p>Sweeping Away Toxic Influences and Reviving the Economy</p>
<p>Increasing production is a responsibility that all citizens should shoulder together, and it is also a work that everyone needs to do in a down-to-earth manner. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the cultivation of the national physique, the revitalization of the national spirit, the clarification of social evils, and the rectification of wartime life. The government has recently implemented a ban on smoking and the elimination of poisons, the main purpose of which is also to achieve this.</p>
<p>The fact that smoking and drugs harm the country and the people is known to everyone, even women and children. For more than a hundred years, because of the evil forces of British imperialism entrenched in East Asia, the spread of opium and drugs has spread throughout China. The number of people killed by it is truly incalculable, and the evils it has created are countless. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Chinese government promulgated a five-year plan to ban smoking, which was quite effective after its implementation. Later, due to the occurrence of incidents, it was suspended. Now, the government is continuing the past smoking ban plan, limiting it to a three-year ban, with simultaneous progress in banning planting, banning transportation, and banning smoking, striving to eliminate the toxic atmosphere as soon as possible. The restoration of national health, the strengthening of the national physique, and the rectification of spiritual life can be expected soon.</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of increasing production is to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time to strive to revive China's economic construction. The government carefully plans and actively expands, and the people should also rise up together and jointly promote it.</p>
<p>Eliminating Corruption and Suppressing Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>Therefore, government officials at all levels must lead by example, and in society, all citizens must practice what they preach. Therefore, we will never tolerate corrupt officials, nor will we sit idly by and let unscrupulous merchants disrupt the financial order. These kinds of germs that corrode politics and criminals that undermine people's livelihoods are not allowed to exist in peacetime, and must be eradicated and cleansed, especially during wartime. If corruption is not punished for a day, the system cannot be established. If unscrupulous merchants are not eliminated for a day, the people's livelihood cannot be improved. The government is determined to severely punish corruption and suppress unscrupulous merchants. From now on, the government will never condone or protect government officials who are corrupt and sell their positions or lawless thugs, and the people must also earnestly report them in order to thoroughly clarify the situation. There are more things we need to do in the future than just the few mentioned above. However, these are the most important tasks that we should actively start and complete as soon as possible. I hope that the people of the whole country and government colleagues will pledge to move forward with the greatest determination and at a consistent pace.</p>

The Shanghai Broadcasting Station has hired the city's mayor and celebrities to give speeches and will hold special broadcasting programs from yesterday to today, as well as various entertainment programs. The atmosphere is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Five Groups Jointly Hold a Celebration Meeting, More Than Two Thousand People From All Walks of Life Attend</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The Citizens Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the China Film Company, and the News United and other public groups, with the support of the Municipal Propaganda Office, jointly held a grand meeting to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The meeting was held at the Grand Theater at 1 p.m. People from all walks of life in the city attended enthusiastically, with no less than two thousand people. Mayor Chen specially sent Secretary-General Zhao to attend and give a speech, and singing and the screening of "The Blessing of Wealth" were held. The atmosphere of the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Grand Meeting</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao from the Municipal Government, Director Shen from the Propaganda Office, and Wen Guanting, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Binhe, Yuan Shu, Lu Feng, Zhang Shankun, and representatives from all walks of life attended. The presidium included Wen Lanting, Yuan Shu, Zhang Shankun, Lu Feng, etc. Ren Yunpeng was the general director of the meeting. The drum and fife band of the First Police Bureau of the city played music at the scene. The national flag and a portrait of the Founding Father were placed high in the center of the presidium. The arrangement was simple, solemn, and grand. The meeting was held on time. After the entire body performed the ceremony as usual, Yuan Shu, from the presidium, delivered the opening speech. Then, Secretary-General Zhao and Mr. Yuan Ludeng were invited to give speeches. This was followed by student singing. The winners of the citywide singing competition jointly organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office and the Municipal Education Bureau sang, first a male and female soprano solo, followed by group singing by various schools. Finally, the film "The Blessing of Wealth" was screened, and the meeting adjourned at about 5 p.m. amidst music.</p>
<h3>Yuan Shu's Speech</h3>
<p>Yuan Shu's opening speech from the presidium briefly stated: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Various public groups in this city have specially held this grand celebration. It has been four years since the National Government's return to the capital. Our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, leads the people of the whole country to strive for peace and unification internally, and to fight side by side with our allies externally in order to liberate East Asia and complete the final victory. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has expelled British and American imperialism from East Asia. From now on, British and American forces have been completely eliminated. On this day of the start of the fourth anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital, we should abide by the three major policies promulgated by our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, namely ensuring security, increasing production, and purifying thought, and work hard to build society, stabilize people's livelihoods, and achieve the victory of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we are gradually moving towards a bright future, and we hope to work harder. At the same time, we wish the Chairman good health."</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng's Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng said in his speech: "I feel very excited to hold this grand celebration of the fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, and I am also pleased to hear that Chairman [Wang] is recuperating in [Qingdao] and recovering his health. This is something that our general public is deeply comforted by. This is the most valuable news on this year's fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, so the commemorative significance felt today is even greater. The central authorities, in order to make our country progress day by day, have decided to purify officialdom and eliminate corruption. Politics is originally a matter for everyone, and people should also sincerely cooperate. Our country's culture has developed for decades, but politics has not yet reached perfection. The so-called governing the country and pacifying the world requires the government to lead from above and the people to assist from below, with unity from top to bottom. Recently, the Municipal Government's measures include banning gambling after the return of the concessions last year, in order to ensure the establishment of security in the city. In addition, in terms of police administration, cooperatives have been established to provide security personnel with a stable life, so that they can do their best to maintain security. In addition, progress is also being sought in education and economics. In terms of economics, abnormal forms of speculation are not allowed. This point should be clearly recognized by the people. Therefore, as a wartime method of economic governance, Mr. Zhao, despite his old age and high moral standing, still adheres to his ambition to serve the country and society. I feel deeply ashamed and, based on the qualifications of shouldering the important mission for the country, I hope that all the old and young people in the city will take on more responsibilities. Therefore, on this fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, I deeply hope that you will work hard to move forward, and that next year, on the fifth anniversary, you will exceed the progress of the past four years. This is the responsibility that every citizen should shoulder."</p>
<h3>Closing Gambling Houses Should Be Carried Out to the End, Youth Movement Authorities Talk</h3>
<p>Regarding the closure of the six major gambling houses in Nanshi, which has been ordered, all parties in the city are delighted with the closure of the gambling houses. The city's youth movement authorities issued a statement saying: Gambling not only ruins lives and destroys families, but also affects social security, which is of great importance. Fortunately, responsible people from all walks of life and the heads of relevant agencies have taken various measures to stop it. Last winter, there were also youth anti-gambling movements. Now that the gambling houses have been closed, this should be carried out to the end in order to maintain the credibility of the government's laws and regulations and to conform to public opinion. In the future, the existence of illegal or similar gambling houses will never be allowed.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Grain Merchants Will Be Ordered to Suspend Business</h3>
<p>The city's Grain Bureau, in order to protect the legal rights and interests of merchants, began to re-register grain merchants from March 1st. It is now learned that the deadline for re-registration is today. According to Article 14 of the General Rules for the Organization of Grain Industry Trade Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, grain merchants of various types should apply for registration with the competent authorities in their localities. Therefore, in the future, grain merchants who have not registered will be deemed to have violated the grain administration regulations and will be ordered to suspend business by the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Fixed Deposit Certificates for Yarn and Cloth Will Be Repaid With Interest Tomorrow, Withdrawals Can Be Made From the Central Reserve Bank With Certificates</h3>
<p>Since the National General Association of Commercial Control was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area, the association has successively issued special fixed deposit certificates in exchange for certificates for the yarn and cloth it has collected, and handed them over to the sellers of yarn and cloth to exchange for special fixed deposit certificates from the Central Reserve Bank. One-half of the payment for the price standard has also been withdrawn from January 1st in accordance with the regulations. It is now heard that the first installment of one-sixth of the principal and the interest payable on the Central Reserve notes portion of the fixed deposit certificates will be due on April 1st. Cloth merchants can withdraw the funds from the Central Reserve Bank with their certificates.</p>
<h3>The First Graduation Ceremony of the Party Training Group, Dean Chen Gave a Speech on Behalf of Wang, the Concurrent Head of the Group</h3>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday's Second Edition)</p>
<p>The New Citizen Movement is the only good medicine for the revival of our Chinese nation. After a year of advocacy and promotion, the organization has now spread throughout the country, and the movement has awakened the entire people. In the main points of the New Citizen Movement, regarding the focus on implementing the Three Principles of the People, it is stated in great detail, which also shows that all party members must first implement it.</p>
<p>Here is a special reminder, which is mentioned in item 4 of the outline: "To advocate the spirit of putting public interests before private interests, individuals should contribute more to the country and enjoy less. Usually, they should be frugal for themselves to enrich the country, and in times of difficulty, they should sacrifice themselves to save the country." This is the spirit of peaceful nation-building, and also the spirit of national revival. If party members do not follow this first, then talk of nation-building, talk of revolution, talk of reviving China, and talk of defending East Asia are all empty words. Since the beginning of our country's history, changes and chaos have been intertwined, and cultural stagnation has occurred because the spirit of putting public interests before private interests has not been promoted. Since the founding of the Republic of China, from Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne, the infighting of warlords, to the harassment of the communists and Chiang Kai-shek's separatist rule, none of them were not caused by the desire for personal gain. Therefore, if we want to build a modern country today and lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia, we must first have everyone have the spirit of putting public interests before private interests, so that we can shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times. Try to see those who are decadent and depressed among the party members, those whose thoughts are wavering, those whose actions are perverse, and even a very small number who reverse the party's slogan of "overthrowing corrupt officials and local tyrants," and willingly become corrupt officials and local tyrants, and willingly become the objects of revolution. Because they only know individualism and do not know the great righteousness of putting public interests before private interests, they only know how to use the powers of the party and the state, and do not know that individuals have the obligation to sacrifice everything for the country. Party members are the backbone of promoting the New Citizen Movement, and should be models for the new citizens. They should practice the spirit of putting public interests before private interests in everything and not violate the right path of saving China and protecting East Asia.</p>
<p>Based on the demands for independence and freedom, the countries of Greater East Asia are moving towards the great road of Greater East Asia co-existence and co-prosperity. Because if the great road of co-existence and co-prosperity is not adhered to, the independence and freedom of the countries themselves, although they can be guaranteed, will still be precarious. The Founding Father [Sun Yat-sen] once said that he would fight together with nations in the world that treat us equally. Looking at the cooperation between our ally Japan and our country, such as the recent return of the concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the formation of the Sino-Japanese Alliance on the basis of mutual benefit and equality, its familiarity in helping and loving us has exceeded treating us equally. Party members should lead the people of the whole country, based on the righteousness of mutual respect, mutual assistance, mutual affection, and mutual love, and love their own country, love their own nation, and love East Asia together, and work together to create a new era in East Asian history. Looking back, the peace between China and Japan was advocated by people of insight in China and Japan, and the people of China and Japan followed suit, so that there is today's phenomenon of sincere cooperation. The Greater East Asia War, which is currently underway, is even more important because it concerns the future of the 100 million people of Greater East Asia. Our ally Japan took the lead independently, and our Republic of China launched a full-scale war later. In the decisive stage where victory is getting closer and the difficulties are increasing, the war situation is extremely tense, and the situation does not allow for any hesitation. Party members should take the lead in rising up and promoting the revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and victory, and lead the people of the whole country to rise up together, give full play to the great strength of the Chinese nation, concentrate all human and material resources, and contribute every bit to the war, share weal and woe, and live and die together, in order to seek co-existence and co-prosperity among the nations of Greater East Asia on one hand, and to build a new modern Republic of China on the other, and to complete the mission of "seeking freedom and equality for China."</p>
<p>Comrades, you are mature talents for the country and the backbone cadres of the party. This time, you were gathered in Nanjing from all over the country. After six weeks of rigorous training, and the earnest instruction of the officials, your determination has become more resolute, and your understanding of the world situation has become clearer. After the comrades return to their jobs, most of them will be able to uphold this spirit, rise up together, and complete the new mission of the new era. I wish you all the best in parting, and I hope you will encourage each other. (The end)</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Urges Exchange for Share Certificates</h3>
<p>The Graveside Securities Exchange previously published a notice asking those holding transfer receipts issued by the exchange to exchange them for stocks or share certificates as soon as possible. The exchange is now requesting once again because there are still many who have not exchanged them, so that they can clear the procedures. As for the more recent transfer receipts issued by the exchange, it is feared that the company that originally issued the shares will need more time to handle the split procedures, and has not yet returned the stocks or share certificates to the bank. If you come to inquire, the details will be informed, or someone will be sent to inquire and urge the original issuing company to handle the matter. From April 1st, the exchange will no longer split stocks or share certificates that do not meet the trading unit.</p>
<h3>Gas Prices Will Be Adjusted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company, in order to compensate for costs due to the continued increase in the cost of coal, has decided to adjust gas prices. It is learned that the new price list has been approved by the relevant authorities, and the company plans to implement it from April. At the same time, the company has also formulated new measures to limit consumption. From the date of meter reading in April of this year to the date of meter reading in October, the gas consumption limit during this period will be implemented by reducing the limit before April by 10%. However, the above restrictions do not apply to users whose consumption limit is less than 120 degrees. In addition, this restriction may be changed at any time depending on the coal situation and other circumstances.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on North-South Currency are Relaxed, the Black Market for Joint Notes is Eliminated</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the black market for joint notes and promote the exchange of materials and funds between North and Central China, the Central Reserve Bank will, from the 27th of this month, prohibit financial institutions from engaging in the exchange and trading of Central Reserve notes for joint notes, and has designated nine commercial banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and two Japanese banks, including the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen, to handle remittances to North China, with a maximum limit of 5,000 yuan per customer per day, in order to facilitate legitimate merchant transactions. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has also changed the previous regulation that limited passengers traveling from Central China to North China to carrying 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve notes to 5,000 yuan per person. Therefore, the restrictions on merchants traveling between Central and North China carrying currency have been greatly relaxed, and they can freely remit money to the designated eleven banks. The black market activity for joint notes has stopped immediately. The Central Reserve Bank is conducting a survey of money shops to recover joint notes at a rate of 18 yuan per 100 yuan. Therefore, the black market for joint notes will disappear invisibly from now on, and the exchange rate of 100 yuan Central Reserve notes to 18 yuan for joint notes will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Various Insurance Companies Increase Capital According to Law, Totaling Over 19 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry believes that the insurance business in this city has flourished in recent years. A total of ninety-seven insurance companies, both newly established and old, have been established, an increase of about seventy compared to before the incident. However, the total amount of registered capital ranges from a minimum of only 100,000 yuan to a maximum of 2.5 million yuan. Only eighteen companies have capital exceeding 3 million yuan. Given that material prices have risen dozens or even hundreds of times, and insured assets often amount to hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan, the assets of policyholders are truly at risk.</p>
<p>In order to supervise insurance companies, improve their organization, and protect the interests of policyholders, the bureau has drafted laws and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for approval, ordering all insurance companies to increase their capital. The minimum capital amount for each company must be increased to 3 million yuan before they can operate. The deadline for increasing capital is from January to the end of June this year. Companies that fail to complete the capital increase procedures within the deadline will be ordered to suspend operations according to law. Recently, insurance companies have been actively completing capital increase procedures. It is reported that a total of eighty-nine companies in the city need to increase capital, with a total capital increase of approximately 19.9 million yuan.</p>

<p>Various Public Associations Assist in Donating Aircraft</p>
<p>After the municipal government issued a notice to all levels of Baojia, assisting in publicity and promoting Baojia aircraft donation fundraising, the Shanghai Citizen Aircraft Donation Movement Committee, in accordance with the government's order, has distributed Baojia commemorative tickets to various district offices and has begun soliciting donations separately. It is reported that the city's Food, Economic, and Health Bureaus also issued notices yesterday, ordering the industry associations under their jurisdiction to complete aircraft donation fundraising within a time limit.

<p>Child Welfare Association Extends Fundraising Period</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association's current fundraising campaign for children's education and care expenses originally aimed to raise one million yuan. However, due to the recent surge in prices, expenses have increased sharply, exceeding the original budget by a significant amount. Based on the current material situation, it is not enough to maintain the year's education and care expenses without raising two million yuan. Therefore, the association's standing committee members, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and others, decided to extend the fundraising period by one month, ending at the end of April. The association hopes that enthusiastic members of the public will continue to assist in fundraising to benefit children.</p>

<h3>Battle Record of the Japanese Naval Air Force in the Truk Islands</h3>
<p>Since the enemy invaded the Marshall Islands, they have been eyeing Japan's Inner South Seas. On the morning of February 17th, they launched a counterattack on the Truk Islands with a force based on battleships and aircraft carriers. The Japanese Army and Navy fought back and launched a fierce battle. As a result, two enemy cruisers were sunk, one aircraft carrier and one warship were damaged, and fifty-four aircraft were shot down. The following is a battle record of this campaign.</p>
<h3>News of Enemy Airstrikes Arrives</h3>
<p>"A strong enemy mobile force has appeared east of the Caroline Islands." After this news arrived, reports of enemy aircraft repeatedly attacking Truk Island flew in. At this time, the scorching sun was in the sky above the base. The Japanese Naval Air Force base, without delay, ordered the attack team to prepare for takeoff. At ○○:00 AM, the contact team commanded by ○○ Lieutenant Commander, who had experienced several battles, took off enthusiastically. Next, an attack team of ○ aircraft carrying torpedoes, commanded by a certain lieutenant, took off. At ○:○0 AM, the contact aircraft reported that the enemy's mobile force consisted of three aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and about twenty destroyers. The position was ○○ li east of Truk, and the course, speed, and formation were reported continuously. The attack team flew to the correct battlefield based on the report. In the South Seas, the sun sets quickly. When the sun sank below the horizon, the contact aircraft ran out of fuel and sent a final wireless message to the base before flying back. Then, only a few squadrons, entrusting their lives to the compass and map, made a blind flight at night. After flying for some time, they reached the sea where the attack was expected. In the absence of moonlight, only under the starlight, the close-knit attack team, all eyes wide open, stared at the sea, unwilling to let go of anything.</p>
<h3>Swooping Down on Prey</h3>
<p>At ○:○0 PM, the enemy mobile force was finally discovered. It was a group of enemy mobile forces, with more than ten cruisers, seemingly surrounding three aircraft carriers, sailing in a column on the dark sea. Estimating their speed at sixteen knots, the order to attack was immediately given. The attack team separated and attacked the aircraft carriers. Before the enemy could shoot, the commanding officer's aircraft, Lieutenant So-and-so, dropped a fish from a point several meters away. The fish hit an enemy ship, which was engulfed in flames and then sank deep into the sea. Judging from the ship type, it was a large cruiser. This large cruiser had seen that the aircraft carrier was in danger, so it traveled at high speed and took on the task of protecting the side of the aircraft carrier, and was sunk. Although it was an enemy army, its actions were worthy of praise. After the torpedo was dropped, the entire enemy fleet began to fire fiercely. What a terrible barrage! Red, green, and yellow tracer bullets, crisscrossing each other, closely followed the Japanese aircraft. At this time, the commanding officer's aircraft and the following aircraft suffered several enemy bullets, but were finally able to escape the tiger's mouth. Earlier than this, the second aircraft, commanded by Chief Petty Officer So-and-so, received the order to launch a full-scale attack. Standing in the gap in the aircraft, he saw a huge enemy ship approaching at close range. Without a moment's hesitation, he embraced the torpedo and rushed towards the enemy ship, carrying out a self-detonation. The enemy ship was immediately engulfed in rumbling explosions and flames. After a few minutes, the Japanese reconnaissance team patrolled the nearby sea, but the enemy ship had sunk into the sea. Its remains could not be seen. "It's a pity that if we could attack again, the battle results would be even greater," said a certain lieutenant who returned to the base, opening his mouth with the first sound.</p>
<h3>Fuel Exhausted</h3>
<p>The enemy mobile force is still coveting the Truk Islands and carrying out intermittent peaceful attacks. From the commander down, everyone's face showed sorrowful anger, worrying about the crisis of the friendly forces. They hoped that the aircraft would increase. If there were aircraft, this would be an excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy's large fleet in one fell swoop. At ○:○0 AM, ○ attack aircraft departed. Two hours later, the attack aircraft commanded by Lieutenant So-and-so took off. There were fewer aircraft in the attack team than the day before, only ○ aircraft. Facing the enemy's large group with a small force and carrying out a quick battle attack, to admire this spirit of the Japanese Navy aircraft, it is impossible not to shed tears. Some time after departure, when the fuel of the contact aircraft was about to run out, the enemy mobile force was again discovered ○○ miles east of Truk Island. The attack team was informed, but unfortunately, the fuel was running out and they had to return to defend. It was already deep at night. At certain bases, in addition to repeatedly attacking the current enemy aircraft, it is necessary to consolidate the base's defenses during the most serious times that are expected. After the attack team departed, the patrol and search aircraft dispatched several times, and the base was filled with tension. There was a sudden rain on this day. Because the weather was not good, one long-distance patrol aircraft had not yet returned. In the aircraft area that was strictly implementing lighting control, under the flickering marker lights, the land guards stood waiting for that aircraft to return, but finally there was no sign of it.</p>
<h3>Attacking the Enemy Again</h3>
<p>Today, when it was still dark, the reconnaissance aircraft rushed into the sky. The weather was still bad on this day, and the sea was filled with broken clouds, and the visibility was almost impossible to see clearly. The enemy ships were not seen, and they returned empty-handed at ○:00 PM. As dusk approached, a report was received that the enemy fleet had been discovered near a certain island. In order to carry out an attack at night, the attack team enthusiastically took to the road with torpedoes deeper into the night. Because there was starlight that night, they were speeding to the battlefield. In the western scene of ○○ Island, but this one was finally sacrificed because it was hit by bullets. All the remaining ones successively dropped bombs close to the enemy ships, but because it was at night, the results of the battle could not be seen, so they retreated with speed. The enemy Gruman weaving frame had already noticed the attack of the Japanese aircraft and tightly forced the Japanese aircraft, but it was finally repelled by the Japanese aircraft. At ○:00, they safely returned to the base. (Translated by Hong from the March 5th Hochi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>The First Day</h3>
<p>— Lu Shayun</p>
<p>The first day at Fugen Store was also the day for choosing a lucky day to worship the master. A brilliant pound candle stood at either end of a long table tied with red satin cloth. Someone would occasionally use bamboo chopsticks to remove the charred wick and soak it in a bowl of cold water, with a squeak.</p>
<p>The room was full of joyous people. A red velvet carpet, three feet square, was placed under a grand master's chair in the center. The matchmaker kept inviting the boss out, and Fugen followed behind.</p>
<p>"Worship, worship the master!" The children exclaimed curiously.</p>
<p>The boss never sat on the grand master's chair for three seconds. The matchmaker finally pressed him down, but he repeatedly insisted on yielding to the side. This was finally accepting the respectful bows. Then he casually pushed the melon-skin hat on his head and said to the matchmaker very gently:</p>
<p>"He is called Fugen, right? No need to do things today. For example, remember the patterns of the bedding: 'Full', 'Three Full', 'Top Grade', etc. Or start from tomorrow! As for the rest, hey!" The speaker greeted the manager (note) who was picking black dates. The matchmaker understood that the rest should of course be asked from the head clerk. So, before the boss finished telling the head clerk to point out Fugen, he repeatedly said goodbye.</p>
<p>The matchmaker solemnly urged Fugen twice more before bidding farewell. The boss said:</p>
<p>"Go downstairs!"</p>
<p>Fugen followed the crowd downstairs, looking around the shop. All were unfamiliar faces. Although his hands were empty, he had no way to start. The boss said not to do things, so how could he do them? As for the bedding, it had already been arranged! Furthermore, remembering the names and types of goods was difficult, as some characters were not known and some items had never been seen before. For example, those things that were slightly larger and harder than soybeans, called "dried mussels," even a genius would not be able to remember.</p>
<p>He was holding his hands, glancing around aimlessly. A wave of buyers left, and then another came. The shop assistants were busy like shuttles. Really, the scales, axes, and triangular paper bags were, in his eyes, more difficult than celestial books. He could not help but feel a little scared in his heart. Why were there so many tricks?</p>
<p>As he was thinking, his eyes caught sight of a pile of persimmon cakes, piled high against the corner of the counter with "wire mesh," both powdery white and soft. He could not help but remember what his mother had said to him in his hometown:</p>
<p>"When apprenticing in a dry goods store, you can eat both sweet and salty things."</p>
<p>He edged over, swallowing his saliva, while looking at the boss. He only saw the shiny bald head, writing in the account book. But he still didn't dare.</p>
<p>"Fugen, come over!"</p>
<p>The boss shouted leisurely. Fugen moved to the ledger anxiously and sullenly, unconsciously wiping his right finger behind his back. The boss pointed to a number on a red checkered bill:</p>
<p>"Calculate it, this bill."</p>
<p>It was like the charm used by the countryside to close the ghosts, a circle and two strokes. Fortunately, he had learned this kind of code word. He reluctantly put the numbers on the abacus beads, and said in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Three times one is thirty-one,"...six retreats once..."</p>
<p>"The first one! The boss tapped the corner of the table with his index finger, while correcting the errors on the abacus with his left hand, shaking his head: "Tsk tsk! You can't even supervise subtraction!"</p>
<p>Fugen was guarding against the tap, which would hit his forehead. He stood awkwardly aside. There was a slight laugh in the shop. When he squinted his eyes to see, dinner had already been served, one dish and one soup, the bowls of rice stacked high. The apprentice who was slightly older than him was smiling at him. Fugen smiled wryly, at a loss. The boss looked at him and pushed him, saying: "Well! Go get food, be flexible!"</p>
<p>After the meal, the boss called him over again and told him: "You have to be able to endure hardship when you come here to learn a trade. Get up at six in the morning, practice the abacus, learn to weigh, write, and don't be lazy. Open the door at seven, then, make water and sweep the floor, if the water plants and ropes are messy, tidy them up. Do small business at will, such as one yuan a packet of oil beans, two yuan a packet of oil kings. You have to serve others during lunch and dinner. When closing, clean up inside and out. Be friendly to the shopkeepers, understand?"</p>
<p>Fugen nodded and came out, standing against the counter. Business was very slow in the evening. The manager was shaking his head and ears while making triangular paper bags, preparing for the one-yuan-a-packet of oil beans for the market tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Before long, there was another shout, it was closing time, and they went out in succession to carry the door panels. Fugen also struggled to take a piece. When he came in, the head clerk was holding a pencil upside down, drawing a naked woman on the gray newspaper, singing in his mouth. Suddenly he stood up, took a piece of gamberi at random, chewed it thread by thread, dragged his shoes upstairs.</p>
<p>When he went to bed, the apprentice patted him on the back and said, "We are friends! Put your bedding next to mine!"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"I'm very busy delivering goods tomorrow morning. You have time to take an axe to the square alkali in the warehouse and chop it up!" Fugen did not answer. What alkali, delivering goods, he did not understand. A thought flashed through his mind, surging — persimmon cakes, hundreds of yuan stuffed in a bag, naked women... what day is tomorrow?</p>
<p>He was still thinking wildly, not knowing where to start, it was two o'clock!</p>
<p>(Note) Head counter: Those who are higher than the ordinary shopkeepers under the boss are equivalent to the so-called manager of a new-style shop.</p>
<h3>I Love to Travel</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jusun</p>
<p>I love to travel,</p>
<p>Travel forever.</p>
<p>I want to temper myself in travel,</p>
<p>And also grow up in travel!</p>
<p>I have walked through the dry deserts,</p>
<p>And also crossed the high mountains and ridges.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning do not discourage my courage,</p>
<p>Gales and rain cannot stop my progress.</p>
<p>My belief is:</p>
<p>Behind the darkness,</p>
<p>There is still light! Look!</p>
<p>Here is a rugged mountain road,</p>
<p>There is the end of flowing water. Listen!</p>
<p>There are pythons wriggling in front,</p>
<p>There are jackals chasing behind. But I still go forward. I do not stagnate because of this, nor do I shrink because of this. My belief is: behind the difficulty is the road to success!</p>
<h3>Word Threads</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>True friendship is not the pleasant laughter you hear when you are happy, nor the pleasant congratulations you receive when you are successful: it is the sympathy and help when you are frustrated, the encouragement and instruction when you are confused, and in the moment of listening, it is harsh and unbearable, even hateful; but when you encounter setbacks or failures, you will feel how valuable and lofty its price is.</p>
<p>Stand on the position of justice, and use the spirit of integrity to resist any unreasonable everything, but keep in mind that the position of justice is construction, not destruction; it is transformation, not destruction; therefore, even if you catch a vicious thief, although you have to execute him, you still try to give him a chance for a new year.</p>
<p>Frankness is the best way to eliminate misunderstandings between friends. Without a seat, you can clean your mind without leaving a little residue. There will be a clear day for right and wrong; however, frankness is not boasting, it is not posting a notice; it is the expression of honest action. Fresh and fashionable clothes will become dirty and broken after a long time; charming and gentle faces will age and become ugly with the passage of time; young girls! Don't worry that your clothes will be out of fashion, and don't be dazed that your hair will be bald and your forehead will wrinkle; turn the time of self-pity to the cultivation of morality and the pursuit of learning; only they can make your life forever young and forever beautiful.</p>

<h3>East Qiao Fierce Battle Extended to This Week Re-Discussion on Righteousness Transformed Overseas Chinese Federation Know Yourself and Your Enemy, A Hundred Battles, A Hundred Victories</h3>
<p>The battle between Donghua and the Overseas Chinese Federation is the most exciting scene in the second cycle of the Football League. It was originally scheduled to meet at Yiyuan last Sunday. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it was raining continuously in the spring. It was extended to 10:30 am this Sunday morning and still clashed in Yiyuan. This journal has published a lottery in the previous issue, briefly discussing the offensive and defensive strategies that Donghua should take, which is enough to help Donghua. During this extension period, we will further discuss the righteous and transformed Overseas Chinese Federation team, so that knowing the enemy's strengths and attacking the enemy's weaknesses can lead to a hundred battles and a hundred victories, and supplement the shortcomings of the previous article.</p>
<h3>Typical Continental Football School</h3>
<p>Jiang's tactics are typical Continental football school. The characteristics of this school are quick kicking, relying on sufficient physical strength, and using long passes. The offensive method is decentralized. The center or two forwards mostly pass to the wings when they get the ball. From this, they go straight in and approach the enemy's goal area to create an opportunity to attack the goal. Everything is progressing in agility. The whole team follows this method, which has been quite successful. What's even more frightening is that Otto Niro, the great general from Tianjin, is the center. His header skills can be used in the second half. He straight tops the pass to the wings, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, which is commendable. The three forwards in the middle do not take a wandering position. They use strong kicks to attack the goal from about twenty yards away. The broadsword and axe are extremely dangerous. When defending, in addition to the five guards retreating, the two inside forwards also retreat immediately. Afterwards, with the ability of seven guards, they follow the ball closely and rush with the ball. This type of kicking requires abundant stamina. And each member of the team is burly and strong. Their spirit in the first five minutes is no different from their efforts in the last five minutes.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings can exert force</h3>
<p>The weakness of Yijiang is that the whole team can exert force, but they are not good at using their brains. The forwards attack hard and defend hard. The guards defend solidly and chase the ball bravely. To break its hard attack, the good use of position and blocking its inevitable and easy kick should be effective. To break its fierce defense, just make more triangular small passes to make it exhausted. Although its endurance is amazing, it must be a mess. Moreover, Donghua is good at this, so be sure to avoid using long passes, which is exactly what Yijiang wants. It is extremely suitable to make more fancy and agile small passes, and I expect they will be at a loss. If the Chinese team wants to score, it must use smoke screen shots. When two or more forwards burst in at the same time, the latter should be allowed to shoot, and the former should use a smoke screen to block the guards, and make the goalkeeper unpredictable and unable to save, so that it can be successful.</p>
<h3>Formation of the Volunteer Army Lineup</h3>
<p>Regarding the distinctions among the volunteer army sections, goalkeeper McNetti Rohti guards the first and second lines of Shanghai. Inner defender Luo Xulai is more reliable than McChetti, both exceptionally courageous. If the enemy general outmaneuvers them, they will quickly turn back and pursue relentlessly. The central defense line will be the most standard in Shanghai. Ottenillo is originally the premier center-back in the Far East. He is tall and sturdy, over six feet in height. He excels at quickly passing the ball out strategically. His heading skills are top-notch, matching his footwork. The left and right fullbacks, Xue Weitai and Xilati, are both versatile and reliable center-back materials. Before Otto arrived in Shanghai, they typically filled the central defense positions. Now, they are being used for lesser roles, but they are more than capable, ensuring success. Therefore, the strength of the central defense line and the excellence of the goalkeeper are known as the "double marvels." On the front line, Taikeni is originally the best left inside forward, but he is now mainly the center-forward because Bama, a soldier coming from Tianjin, is better than Taikeni at left inside forward. Furthermore, Bama's defensive skills are a cut above the rest. Bao Jie, the right inside forward, is well-known to fans, needing no further praise. The left and right wings, Viladi and Panana, are both able to execute long crosses and also shoot from the corners. In summary, the team's talent is well-distributed, with many capable individuals. The lineup for this match has already been announced by the association. The arrangement is definitely the most standard.</p>
<h3>Earnestly Wishing for Donghua's Efforts</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the observations of the volunteer generals in various aspects may not be exhaustive, but they are within these limitations. The reason I introduce them is not to inflate the morale of others, but to hope that Donghua can know themselves and their opponents, so that they can compete and capture them.</p>
<p>Reaching this point in the writing, it can be concluded. However, my hopes for Donghua are so earnest that I will not hesitate to repeat myself. I hope our athletes will remember to avoid excessive dribbling, utilize triangular short passes, and use their strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. In defense, the defenders should cover the area within twenty yards of the goal and not rush out. Zhang should focus more on defensive support, and A Liang should assist in attack, avoiding excessive running that leads to nothing. I have said all I need to say here. The words are concise but meaningful. I have reviewed my words three times. I wonder if the athletes and fans will find my words too lengthy but sympathize with my intentions?</p>
<p>On this cold spring night, I write this, hoping not to fail the shared expectations of us all!</p>
<h3>Recent Shanghai Basketball Games: Offensive Strategies of Each Team (Part 1) Besides Fast Breaks and Long Shots, Four Other Breakaway Tactics Should be Adopted</h3>
<p>During the past West Qing Basketball League, I was often a guest in the audience. I have learned from the powerful teams in Shanghai. The level of each team is very high. The most noteworthy aspect is their ability to pass the ball skillfully. Long-range shots from mid-court often hit the bullseye. Even with a Maginot Line-like defense, it's useless because they don't need to engage in close combat. They can win with long-range shots from the outside. This is good, but it's also bad. Because long shots are the most effortless shortcut to breaking the enemy's formation, few of the ten shots involve dribbling to the basket and putting it in. As a result, everyone doesn't bother to study passing and cutting. The offensive power of local basketball is not very impressive. To tell a joke, if both sides agreed that long shots don't count, the basketball score would be like a soccer score: one to zero or three to two.</p>
<p>The most exciting scene in the entire league was the friendly match between Zhongqing and the West Qing Giants. They used man-to-man defense, which was extremely aggressive. Zhongqing gathered the elite from Hua Mu, Lian Ren, Yu Shan, and other teams. That day, they had high-speed passing and brilliant penetration. They moved freely in the Giants' defensive line. The West Qing players followed them closely, but they were at a loss. There were several times when they were at a loss and watched the Zhongqing players shoot under the basket.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Offensive Tactics</h3>
<p>The offensive tactics in the other matches cannot escape the following two methods. The first method is that as soon as the ball is received, everyone rushes to the basket like lightning, creating a two-on-one or three-on-two advantage before the enemy's defense has been set up. This tactic is called "fast break." It is ineffective against teams with tight defenses. Therefore, there is a second method: after the ball crosses the mid-court, it is passed back and forth outside the defensive line. If the enemy guard relaxes slightly, a long-range shot is taken. Sometimes there is a central breakthrough, a grand plan to attack the enemy's stronghold directly. But the result rarely becomes a reality. For the most part, they retreat when they see the difficulty, and the ball returns to the hands of the team's inner guard. Although this kind of play is much more advanced than basketball that does not distinguish between offense and defense and specializes in stealing opportunities, it is a bit boring and dull.</p>
<h3>Four Other Breakaway Tactics Should be Adopted</h3>
<p>The reason why Shanghai basketball teams adopt this offensive is that all teams except Giants and Monoc adopt regional defense. We cannot but admit that fast breaks and long shots are the most effective methods to deal with regional defense. At the same time, we must study how to break through this defensive line and rush into the enemy's basket to shoot. This is possible, as long as the following conditions are met.</p>
<h3>High-Speed Passing</h3>
<p>Pass the ball immediately after you get it. Be quick, use short passes, dribbling, and backhand passes. Do not waste too much time. If the ball stops moving or is passed too slowly, not only will you not be able to attack, but there is also a risk of being intercepted by the enemy guard or forced into a jump ball. Recently, the guards in this city have become very skilled. As soon as they see an enemy player with the ball, two of them rush up to prevent you from passing back and forth outside the defensive line or shooting calmly. In the game between Hua Lian and Giants, Giants were more than ten points ahead. A few minutes before the end, Mu Lian had a stroke of inspiration and used this tactic to break the Giants' offensive and turn defeat into victory.</p>
<h3>Clever Cutting</h3>
<p>When a player on your team dribbles towards the enemy's defensive line, the other four players should use decoy methods to get rid of the enemy guards' surveillance and cut into (Cut) effective locations to receive passes from teammates. This depends entirely on the individual's talent. People with a keen sense of feeling can see the positions of all the players on the court at a glance and can predict the situation after several passes and penetrations. It's like ordinary people playing chess, making one move at a time. Experts can predict four or five moves. It is common to see one person getting the ball and the other four standing there like wooden chickens, or running around aimlessly. The person with the ball is isolated and helpless. He wants to pass but can't, getting into a disadvantageous situation. Sometimes someone cuts into the right place. Even if they shout loudly, the person with the ball does not pass the ball over. A team that is uncoordinated in this way cannot launch an offensive unless they put in a lot of effort on cutting and passing.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>What I Saw and Heard at Zhongqing</h3>
<p>The current situation at Zhongqing is that Group A is dominated by Zhongbei and Dahua. Mu Lian and Yao have already failed once, so they are at a slight disadvantage. Group B is dominated by Ren Yu. The women's team is led by the Green Team, which has already eliminated two strong overseas Chinese teams from the three provinces. The remaining two games will definitely be won against Kang Ai. The only difficult opponent is Dahua. However, Dahua may not be sure of victory against the overseas Chinese from the three provinces. Based on this, the Green Team has an optimistic future.</p>
<p>Women's basketball games with similar strength are very likely to have unexpected results. Each quarter is only eight minutes long. After removing jump balls (which are particularly common in women's games) and other transitions, if a team has better luck, the weaker team can win. Therefore, I say that unless there is a clear difference in strength, women's games are prone to upsets.</p>
<p>The three musketeers of the former Qixiu women's basketball team, Zhang Jiapei, Yan Weiwen, and Liu Zhenbao, are now gone. Zhang has married and is rarely seen on the court. Yan and Liu are serving in the Green Team, and their heroic spirit is still the same. Yan's basketball skills are improving day by day, and her physical strength is also more abundant than before, making her a standard center material. Liu has switched to point guard, performing impressively, with extremely precise guarding, making it difficult for enemy forwards to get past her. Zhen is truly a versatile player.</p>
<p>Defenders in women's basketball have fewer opportunities to shine and rarely have opportunities to shoot, so they are not easily noticed by fans. However, experienced basketball viewers know that defenders with superb skills can make people remember them forever, such as the former Chen Jinchai, Xi Xun, Zhou Xiuzhen, and the current Wang Weizhen of the Green Team. They have truly made amazing performances and made great contributions.</p>
<p>Zhang Weisheng, the owner of the Hualian Pharmaceutical basketball team, said that although they unfortunately lost to Donghua, it is not a cause for concern. If they can remain undefeated in the future, the hope is still strong. Even if they unfortunately lose again, what does it matter? The team hopes to win the championship, but they place more emphasis on sportsmanship, ethics, and obedience, which can be a model.</p>
<p>In the game between Ren Yu and Shantou last Thursday, Yu Xunzi, the main player of Ren Yu, and Zhou Bin of the Oil Team collided accidentally. Yu Xunzi was seriously injured. While unconscious, Lao Yu still shouted "Shooting for the basket." The player's spirit is admirable. It is said that Yu Xunzi's injury was caused by hitting his teeth, which caused him to bleed and faint. He was later sent to Renji Hospital and is now fine. He will be back on the court next time.</p>
<p>The women's basketball players with the best shooting posture are Lin Xiangzhi of the overseas Chinese team, Huang Meijuan of Dahua, and Rong Shujian of the Green Team. Lin rises up and shoots in the air when shooting. Huang's feet are in a straight line when jumping up to shoot from under the basket, like a diving shot in swimming. Rong shoots with both hands, and her body leans to the side at the moment the ball is released, which is wonderful.</p>
<p>The Tianguang team, organized by a group of news reporters, has joined the Group B competition. The main player, Chen Cheng, stands out from the crowd, and his performance is very watchable.</p>
<p>Whenever there is an exciting game, it is sure to be full, and the fans stand outside the gate without leaving, regardless of the permanent air defense street darkness. The spirit of the fans is something that we cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Players must have their wives accompany them to the game, such as the wives of Ma Xizhi and Zhang Liangxiong.</p>
<p>Zhongqing tickets usually still sell for ten yuan, but on Sundays, because there are two games day and night, the price will increase to forty yuan, which can be watched continuously, and the fans still do not lose out. (Mei Jie)</p>
