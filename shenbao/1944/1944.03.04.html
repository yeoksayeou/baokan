<p>代評</p>
<h3>物價究竟如何？</h3>
<p>— 栗本寅治</p>
<p>今日市井中的話處，差才多都在談論着物價問題。日本有句諺語說：「三人集，文珠之智慧。」意思就是說：如果幾個人聚在一處商量，能够產生好的智慧。中國也有一句古語說：「三人行，必有吾師。」但在今日的上海，如果有三個人聚在一起，所談的總是「物價究竟如何？」而其結果是信口造謠，一無結果。中國還有句古語說，三人市虎」，正是指這種情形。</p>
<p>在往年，據我們的常識，戰爭一起，物價總是向上。又在承平時期，物姿不足，亦促使物價向上，這是原則。這都是因為以硬貨為尺度的緣故。所以通貨的膨脹量與物價的騰貴率的比例總是約略相等。然至今日，以硬貨為通貨基準的時代巳經過去了。今日的通貨，已進展到國家的管理通貨的時代，通貨作為物資交換的决算用具。在今日的管理通貨時代依然用硬貨流通時代的思想，作物價的尺皮，那眞是大錯。</p>
<p>由此而言，今日通貨價値的基礎，無疑是在於國民對於管理者的信用，也就是對於國家的信賴心。</p>
<p>可是，把去冬以來的物價來劃曲綫，從如登平坡地緩綏上升的物價，而突如攀登急坡地直綫上升。另一方面，我們並不會發見，南京政府對內對外突然發生了些什麽重大事件，使民衆减低其對南京政府的信賴心，而足以促使物價這樣飛漲。戰爭必然地增加某種物資的消耗，並往往造成物資的偏頗，這是不能否認的。然而僅憑這個原因，不會造成物價像今日這樣的飛漲吧！</p>
<p>目前在大東亞戰爭最激烈的時期中，我日本每石米（約合中國一石八斗七升）的價格約日金五十圓。折合備備券，折合中國的一石米約為一百五十元弱。這是公定價格，全體人民均受這廉價米的配給。國民不是更進而協力政府的政策，自動節制消費嗎？一面再看通貨的發行量，膨脹至六年前的四倍，米價與六年前的比例差不多。其他物價也大致和米價相等。由此以觀，物價與通貨的增加量以同一的比率上升。可見硬貨時代我們的常識，在今日的日本，早巳失效了。</p>
<p>棉花一項，中國的價格近來聽說已到一萬元了，然而在日本，以每担一百六十圓（約合中國六百六十餘元）的價格，作為計算基礎，配給製品。而國民對其不自由與不够，尙且自動的實踐消費節約。</p>
<p>這些事實，完全是國民對政府的施策表示信賴舉協力。因此，縱使在戰爭最激烈的時期中，物價也很安定。</p>
<p>所以，中國物價高漲的原因，完全是政治與經濟的不一致，國民之閒自然體成了一種各相遊離的情勢。</p>
<p>日本的通貨發行量，據日本銀行發表，約為百憶圓。但是民間銀行所有的存款，已超過五百億。存款通貨已五倍於通貨發行量。此外，郵政儲金亦有五百億以上。這種情形，並有可以用通貨政策隨意調整物價的力量。</p>
<p>但在上海，中國的民間銀行存款，據聞佔計僅二十數億元。而通貨發行量雖未有正式宜布。但民間存款不過通貨發行量的×分之一。這是中國惟一的最大經濟都市的情形。此種狀態，當然使金融施策在物價政策上不會有多大的效果，而當局的苦心，亦可窺知了。</p>
<p>上海現在有着崎形的繁榮狀態。在這參戰中國的領土之一的上海，在這中國惟一的經濟的中樞的上海……畸形繁榮，必然有着享樂慾望，街頭巷尾充滿着享樂的歡聲。試問參戰中國的眞面目，應該如此嗎？往年的勞働階級，手裏不輕易有十元的硬貨，但在今日，有幾千幾百元紙幣的極平常。工業商業的經營者，有了幾百千萬元的現鈔，就以為很富有了，跑到享樂的地方，燈紅酒綠，消磨永夜。今日上海，正充滿着這種暴發戶。</p>
<p>但這些人如想以自己所有的儲備劵來交換今日的物資，恐怕不能得到戰前所能保有的數量之牛，或三分之一。如其想到多了錢而少了物的事實，恐怕沒有一個人不感到幻滅的悲哀吧！</p>
<p>再說到管理通貨的木質，往年中國的人們，懷抱着硬貨，眞以為這是實貝。但現在應該知道，如果沒有管理通貨，物資無論增加到何種程度，物價不容易順利穩定。叉民衆對於參戰中國時局的前途，應有以堅强的確信，克服應付道極嚴重的局勢之覺悟。像今日這樣中國官民所抱的不知不覺問威脅自身的通貨觀，應即刻放棄，上下一心，相率向中國新秩序的建設，向經濟建設，協力邁進。</p>
<p>使物價愈趨高昂的「物價究竟如何」的不安的話題，應從速使之從市井中消失。這是我們最所切盼的。我們相價不聽見這話題的時候，就是物價漸落而趨向適當安定的第一步，因民衆的確信，實為富國强民的根本。（翔譯）</p>
<h3>日軍擊沉美潛艇兩月來達十一艘　新幾內亞游擊戰予敵重創</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日大本營三日發表帝國海軍艦艇及陸海軍航空部隊，一二兩月中於日本近海及其他作戰海面，擊沉敵潛艇十一艘。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電敵美恃其物質，屢在中部太平洋方面執拗反攻，敵潛水艇亦復活躍，據三日日大木營發表，日海軍艦艇與陸，海軍航空部隊，自入本年以來迄二月底止，曾擊沉敵潛艇十一艘，此十一艘計一月中擊沉五艘，二月中擊沉六艘，均經確認沉沒。其中，有因海上，海面為日機投彈命中司令塔，而立即沉沒者，有因受日騙逐艦深水炸彈之轟擊，湧起黑色水柱而沉沒者，有因被日騙逐艦夜間砲擊，轟去司令塔而立即沉沒者。此等敵潛艇，為不予日本片刻閑暇，謀威脅日軍接濟綫及南方重要資源之輪向日本內地，而於日本近海及其他方面出現者一，但在日木陸，海軍緊密協力之下，其企國均不得逞。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電新幾內亞某基地電：新焭內亞島馬富南方拉姆河畔之日軍，除邀擎不斷來犯之敵軍，予以重創外，並隨時隨地派遺挺身部隊出擊敵軍，採取游擊戰術，出敵軍之不意，予敵重創。由一月中旬起至二月中旬止，約一個月間，僅在該方面使敵地上部隊損失二千七百人，緣拉姆河右岸地區科羅哈東方昻哥爾附近一役，敵軍因日軍之游擊戰術而傷亡者達一千五百人，哈斯納附近之役，敵遣屍約一千具，此外，並重創敵軍二百人以上，各役日軍所予敵軍之損害中，負傷較戰死為少，其原因為拉姆河畔之戰鬬多在極近距離實施游擊戰。勇猛之日將士，常以肉彈戰突人敵軍腹鄧，以上各役中，日軍之損失約六百人，遠少於敵軍之損書，揆其原因，係由於日軍在密林山地中展開游擊戰所致。</p>
<h3>日駐華派遣軍　一週間戰况</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電日駐華派遺軍三日發表二週戰况如次：　華北方面之渝共軍，經日軍不斷之掃蕩後，業予殲滅。僅有殘兵敗卒逃至山岡地帶，以暫保殘喪。最近覺悟抗戰之錯誤，而投效和運者，已層出不窮。即　昔晉冀魯邊區參議年秋鈞，最近已行憬然改向，從事建設新中國之偉大工作。同時孔立耐以下七百人，及褚金明以下四百人等，亦陸續效忠和運。　二十九日渝機會來襲安慶地區，經日機邀擊後，被擊落一架，餘則惶然遁去。　最近渝共軍所受之損害極重，然仍屢增兵力，並且為空襲日軍木土起見，特積極建設空軍基地，同時為擾亂和平地區起見，時以遊擊戰術從事騷擾。</p>
<p>斯蒂威爾負傷</p>
<p>廣州三日中央社電聞最近渝美聯合軍司令官斯蒂威爾，於富貢地區，當日軍與渝軍交戰時，頓受創傷，狼狽敗走。茲據二十三日大公報載稱：斯蒂威爾最近於緬甸前綫視察時，為日軍砲火所傷。同時隨行之人員及將校，亦有相當死傷云云。由此可知彼之負傷，乃屬確實。斯蒂威爾最近為指揮重慶雲南遠征軍，及富貴地區之重慶軍起見赴前綫督戰，英美為圖奪回緬甸起見，徒使重慶犧牲於日軍砲火之下，此種狡猾之行為，實為人神難容，　斯蒂威師始有此負傷之懲罰。此次於緬印邊境作戰巳予敵人以莫大打擊，今彼重要幹部斯蒂威爾之負傷，不啻于以雙重之打擊也。</p>
<h3>緬人生擒　美飛行士</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據緬甸前綫某基地電。細甸自獨立以來，即協力日軍担當大東亞之建設工作，積極向擊滅英美之途　進。最近組人勇敢生擒欲遁向雲南之一敵美飛行士，復成為戰塲中之逸事。即二月某日在印美陸軍職鬥機十二架侵入緬甸領空，於緬甸某地附近曾遇日戰鬥機隊，當展開壯烈之空戰，將其擊落五架。此時敵戰鬥機隊長機受重創起火，倖得利用降落傘降於某地北方　林中彷徨，嗣被細人艾蒙發見，當將之誘至家中，留宿一夜。是夜該人對艾蒙謂，余乃美國飛行士，急圖遁入雲南，若能如願，當賞以美幣百元。十七日艾蒙與另外二人自該地起程，因該飛行土持有手鎗，必須以妙策始可將之交予日軍，三人苦思之結果，乃導其至距離日軍十里許之地點而交與日軍。</p>

<h3>英對土耳其　施高壓手段　停止以軍需品供土</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電關於英國停止對土耳其輸出軍需物資一事，美聯社安加拉特派員二日曾報稱·最行因英土兩國作戰會談宣告次裂，致安加拉政界邇來頻傳英政府將制止對土輸出軍輸物資及民需物資，然土政府當局未確認此種消息。惟土政府對於此種高壓手段，應付方策實惑困難，此乃亳無疑義，然一部人士認為英國採取此項措置後，對土政府雖已絕念，然對東南歐另有所企圖。</p>

<h3>强化指導力量</h3>
<p>— 藤山愛一郞</p>
<p>原作者為海軍軍政數問，東京都商工經濟會會長。</p>
<p>戰局雜感</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭大詔頒發以來，已二年有備，在此期間，經濟界也已拋棄舊習慣，變為戰時體制，從事產業經濟的人士，可說每個人都已改變了田為想。回顧大東亞戰爭前夕，產業經濟界諸般情勢，以及有關係人們的心境，與今日完全不同，即可瞭然。</p>
<p>例如在事業擴張方面，鑑於戰後的環境，雖說是國家的要求，也曾有許多人，對於自己經營的公司，認為不妨讓其在最小限度內擴充，可是在今日，我想沒有人再抱這種主張了。如為目前國家所希望者，縱縱張至任何地步·亦有所不辭。</p>
<p>為了擬訂增强戰力，整備企業之具體方案雖經在東京經濟會議召集商業者，徵詢其意見。在業者自身間，有要求五成至六成之整備率者，而官廳方而，想到消費者的立塲，反煞費古心，以謀其調整抑制。甚至在最舊式的商業體制中：有活潑議論着必須採取綜合配給所制度者。由此可見因時局的嚴重，致最落伍的人的頭腦也竟然改變了。而官廳方面割據主戰者的頭大部一致，若說尚有少數人的頭腦未變，有政府加以堅强指導，當可順利進展。所以現在却是國民和產業界在等待着總進軍的號令。</p>
<p>總而言之，政府的指導，往往流於事務方面，缺少氣魄、各種國民運動。亦缺少一貫精福，使國民今日未能更堅强奮起，而抱消極的杞憂。貯蓄增進訓練是必要的，閒暇栽培運動也是必要的，可是在這些以外，那培養積極精神的國民運動，更為必要。此則需要偉大的政治。</p>
<p>敵人美國，自戰事初起之「毋忘珍珠灣」以至於」到東京去到東京去「等口號，愈見積極實行着。吾國為欲建設大東亞共榮圈，美本土上陸作戰的積極論，實不可少。這種壯志，是必要的。即使在堅守中，任何時機，當具長驅出擊之可能，這的作戰家所激給我們的。</p>
<p>這種綢極指導，在今日日本的國民運動中，不是缺少着麼？這不是因為日本的國民運動中，缺少着氣魄偉大的政治力麼？既是如此，政府和國民運動指導者，應更大膽率直地說話，作强有力的指導纔對。</p>
<p>增加生產的一切設施，在着着改善中，從事經濟產業的人，皆在其自已崗位上配置戰鬥。生產增强的進軍，已經發動了。這進軍如果活潑健的大，道那的是於必勝的大道的。</p>
<p>只有發渾有力的政治指導力，纔能改變一切的頭腦，打破割據主義，使國民戰鬥配置之戰塲，充滿活潑勇氣，邁步前進。（韋庵節譯自二月十二日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>太平洋方面　美軍戰略失敗　松島報導部長談話</h3>
<p>日本在滬陸軍報道部，艦隊報道部，大使館上海事務所情報部，昨（三日）下午三時在南京路匯中飯店，聯合招待本市新聞記者，出席人員計陸軍報道部坂本中尉，赤星囑託，艦隊報道部長松島大佐，　田大尉，坂爪囑託，大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，福間副領事暨各報社記者二十餘人</p>
<p>馬利亞納美軍失敗</p>
<p>松島部長首先發表談片謂：最近太平洋戰局，美軍在馬利亞納作戰，業已根本失敗，美國初意擬誘致日本主力艦作戰，其計未逞，復用航空集團力量襲擊日軍，亦未得手，反損失航空母艦及戰艦多艘，欲圖恢複，必需相當時日。歡察敵軍所用戰略，係用「奇」戰，而不用「正」戰，正戰是堂堂主力艦隊正面作戰，奇戰則避免正面作戰，從來無奇戰能獲致重大勝利利利者。矣軍自在夏威夷正戰失敗後，不得已擬作奇戰嘗試，集中航空兵力配合戰艦，圖襲擊我軍，但結果受重創而去。</p>
<p>日軍深研孫子兵法</p>
<p>大佐　謂：日軍作戰恒奉中國孫子兵法為圭泉·孫子兵法曰「微乎微乎，至於無形，神乎神乎，至於無聲，形人而我無形」，日軍作戰善體此旨，故無往不利。</p>
<p>渝掃蕩報所載不確</p>
<p>本月一日重　掃瀆報戰稱：美國在太平洋戰役，雖獲成功，但未進悉日軍虛實。又謂美國有戰艦八艘，航空母艦多艘，在太平洋作戰，日軍對之甚為　怕。復謂在馬利亞納與特魯克兩處作戰之艦隊係兩個不同艦隊，統歸馬克尼米加少將指揮，松島大佐對此表示尤為可哂，謂日海軍非但不對美海軍懼怕，反能將彼擊沉海底、至兩處作戰之艦隊實二而一者，掃蕩報欲藉此顯示美海軍大，賞屬不值識者一笑。據此而觀，重慶方面之負責情報者，應速研究中國之武經七書。</p>
<p>政治解决犧牲重慶</p>
<p>松為大佐復為稱：據英國方面發表，對美國海軍之惑想謂，美國擬將日本生力艦隊撲滅，而後進駐中國大陸，事實上次不可能，並謂歐洲戰局如不能解次，而太平洋戰事亦難解次，又有一英國某要人與重慶方面之某耍人談稱，歐洲戰事解决之後，關於太平洋戰局當用政治方式謀解次之云云。觀察以上所云，吾人深覺勿論歐洲之戰果如何，用政治方式解决太平洋戰爭，首先犧牲者厥為重農，反軸心方面所稱之英美蘇渝四强陣綫，實係詭略，根本英美並未重視重慶之地位也</p>
<p>必勝信念上下一致</p>
<p>據目前重慶發行之英文文摘雜誌載稱：記者某述所羅門方面戰况謂，某次日艦沉下，有一水兵浮出水面，美船擬加援救，但該水兵表示拒絕，一面復以武器抗拒，故記述者謂日軍之軍心强盛，莫可名狀，次非美軍所能征服。</p>
<p>日本方面之必勝信念，實為上下內外所具有，回憶四年前美航空部隊空襲揚子江上游某城市時，適有三日孩在土地上以神主牌作拜神游戲，炸彈擲落在十米突以外，泥土飛揚，立刻將三孩淹沒土內，但為時不久，三孩均自泥土中爬起，神色自若，竟毫不受傷，似有神助，實屬奇蹟，目前日軍第一綫將士，均具有神力謹佑的必勝信念。</p>
<p>防空措置戰時必要</p>
<p>昨日起本市已實施永久燈火管制，松烏大佐對此亦有所闡述謂：防空措置，為戰時所必需，上海市民未慣受此種措施，因而發生若千謠傳，實不應當。又如關於近來對汪主席之健康，亦有謠傳，車實上日本海軍武官某日前方在南京晉靄生席，於主席長好健康狀態中暢談頗久。</p>
<p>松平部長談話</p>
<p>極房部長談畢，松平情報部長繼之對國府聘　小倉氏為國府經濟顧問事有所闡發，松平部長稱：小倉氏為日有數之產業家，中日在大東亞戰爭中同負重耍責任，中國之鑛產蘊藏　富，小倉氏來華　，於鑛產增產雷有臣大貢。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>足量猶為未足</h3>
<p>一戰時經濟政策網領一中關於調離物價者，戲　這麽一條：「改善配給機構，並確保配給之普這及合理之配給數量，以杜絕黑市。一所謂普遍配給及合理數量，驟屬之，以為一個完美配給制度的一切必要條件了，其實，單是普這配給及合理數量，即使能够實現了，倘然對於質的保障，一無辦法，依然不能滿足配給制度的理想條件。</p>
<p>在今日物價　貴，生活艱難的環境下，人人都埋怨於配給物量之不足，同時，更埋怨於配給物質之不堪，以致配給制度所博得的成績，祗是一片怨聲，其財，輾轉剝削，變為吮血之蟲，而配給制度直成為陵奪民衆利益之媒介。醫如，以人民最主要之日用必須品沐與煤－而論，有白米復有糙米，於是白米可能地都由配給米店的後門流入白米的黑市去了；配給煤球而無煤球標準之規定，或即有規定而無法確定其標準，於且煤球可能地都成為純爛泥團了；結果，人人感覺米卽食之不能下咽，煤也列灰無從復燃，如此而欲望米煤黑市之消滅，又將安得？</p>
<p>所以在今日加强配給機構聲中，除了增加配給品種類與其數量而外，必須同時注意於其質的保持或改進，否則配給制度是終於不能抵抗黑市的。所以義足量猶為未足。</p>
<h3>糧局令公會　補辦食商登記</h3>
<p>本市糧食局鑒於邇來各種糧食價格飛漲，故對遵守政府法令經營業務，查本市各杯糧食商人須向該局登記註冊待領得證書後，始可營業，該局以近來時有不法商人私自開業，為維各該商人法益起見，特辦理糧商補行登記，凡攸關糧食各業公會（如食用油業，食業雜糧業）已先後接到該局命令，一飭公會通知會員遵令辦理，登記載止期為三月三十一日，逾期即以違背種政規則論，勒令其停止營業</p>

<h3>行莊緊縮放款後　囤積惡風漸　正當工商業未受影響</h3>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會為調　會員行莊同業金副　理拆放欵項後，茲為紡止名同業利用拆放數項有所投機囤積起見，自本年起實施緊綿放歡，並依照各同業之活期，存款總數，即各同業在各該月份計算應繳活期存款準備金所根據之數額，列表送交該會作為改訂拆放限度之標準。並聞各同榮凡提供財產為担保品，依照規定限度向該會申請拆　，亦以正當業務上需要為限。</p>
<p>同時各行莊對於各業貸放，因此不得不隨之緊縮，其審查一項尤為審眞，完全遵照財政部頭佈之法令以及銀錢業訂定之限制辦法辦理。自緊縮放款以來，因銀根之緊急，投機囤積之惡風日見，而正當工商業需要借款要，仍予酌量核放，並未受到緊縮放歡之影響</p>

<h3>對於主要商品囤積治罪條列的管見</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>報載囤積主要商品一律嚴懲一節，因而想到囤機治罪條例的規定，如何始能圓滿實施，不成為具文。以收抑制漲價的實效？這是一個重大問題。願就該條例略述管見，以備採納：</p>
<p>囤積二字，原非僅一收藏的意義。普通人民，為直接消費起見，收藏一定址的商品，自然不算囤積。但是每戶可以收藏之直接消費量，究克若干？應該明白規定。否則不肖吏員，必將假藉條例，以為索詐的工具。這是利未見而那先見了。</p>
<p>藏富於民，古有明訓。現在尚有商品，可以　市出資者，全賴從前的收藏。所以商品漲價，太不能歸咎於收藏。而應該歸餐於囤積居奇。條例所禁止的以營利為目的的囤積，自然應該解釋為貪圖暴利的囤積居奇，倘若普通人民收藏主要商品，稍稱超過直接消費量，而並無貪得暴利之企圖者。也尚非囤積。不應處刑。</p>
<p>要禁止囤積居奇、首先要使同業公會會員，都願登記所存商品。今條例即已規定匿不登記的罪刑。但是商人最怕虧本。因為歷米政府評，物價，動涉茍刻。廉價强制收買的　例。所以無敢登記。茲若政府改該史張。對於已日登記的商品，甚市預一拆息，保證出賣時得學合理的利利利。則自然商人配給了。</p>
<p>因囤積而操縱市價擾亂市塲者，自然人神共憤。應處極刑，但是何謂操縱市價？何謂擾亂市塲？在適用條例上，應有合理確切的解釋。否則執法者任意曲解。不難故入人罪，流弊將不可勝言。</p>
<p>公務員之為囤積，　應較普通人民，加重其前，但是並非假藉權或地位者，仍應以普通人民論，不過因其有公務員的身份，應同時受懲戒耳。至包庇操縱市價擾　市燃者，都是有特殊權勢的公務員。此輩可稱罪大惡極，倘當局果能破除情面成以死刑，自然足昭炯戒。以挽頹風。</p>
<p>徒法不足以自行故必先完備調查檢舉及裁判執行之制度，而任事人員父必具有守正不阿的精神，堅强不屈的毅力，始能執法以繩。否則法將成為具文，辭罰愈嚴，實施愈難，徒供吏員敲詐的工具而已。今條例自頒布以來，從未明定如何裁判執行之制度，而由各有關官署，派出委員，合組物資調查委負會，既非專任其事、更無獨立職機，尤難期其詳密調查公牛檢舉。茲若欲使條例有效實施，首當從完備制以，改組機關人手。</p>
<h3>人類未來的希望</h3>
<p>— 姚錦城</p>
<p>「機器人」觀後感</p>
<p>苦幹劇團的「機器人」終於在巴黎大戲院獻演了。</p>
<p>這雖然是一個理想　，劇中寫寫的時代，一直推遠到五百年以後。可是塔顯然是從現實的花床中孕育出來的。所以塔儘管浪漫詭奇，畢竟還是人問的產品，在炫目的光影之中，仍然使觀衆然到親切</p>
<p>五百年以後的世界將進步動什麽程度吧？「機器人」告訴我們，那時候的建築巳經是完全流綫型的了，在形態上，給人議種極其流動的印象，一切顯　饒向於簡單和實用，並且極端的科學化和機械化。無綫電傳影是異當警逼了。空氣溫度全用人工調節，不受自然的支配。地球和星球業巳可以往來一，交通器具已經發明一種火箭，幾分鐘內可飛行幾萬空哩。……最重要的，工廠和田野間的一切勞作，都可以不用人力，而用一極「機器人」來代替。</p>
<p>劇作者似乎深恨人類的自私和殘酷。所以在這樣的科學文明的時代，人們却依舊充滿着種種偏狹，庸俗，腐化的意識形此此會依然在商人的手裘，科學家依然受着種種牽制。作者諷刺得最無情的，就是機器人暴動的一幕，人類已經顏於絕滅了，工廠會計主任還還諷狂地想用金錢賄時機器人，希岡逃命。</p>
<p>但天眞純潔和仁愛究竟戰勝了一切，當末一幕一對男女小機器人在音榮悠揚聲中，冉冉神向天際，燈光照着她們，顯得極其倘況迷離，有如仙鳥中的祥震　　，這時全院掌聲雷動，而「機器人一全劇的主題，－人類未來的希望，也就顯明地點出來了。</p>
<p>本劇導演和演員，都能勝任愉快。裝置服裝道具燈光的美麗動人，音樂配製的傑出，都可以說是空前的。（作者係本報助學生）</p>

        <h1>1944.03.04</h1>
<h3>What About Commodity Prices?</h3>
<p>— Toraji Kurimoto</p>
<p>Today, almost everyone in the streets is talking about the issue of commodity prices. There is a Japanese proverb that says, "Three people together, the wisdom of Manjusri." Meaning, if several people get together to discuss, they can produce good wisdom. There is also an ancient Chinese saying, "When three men walk together, there is one who can be my teacher." But in Shanghai today, if three people get together, they always talk about "What about commodity prices?" And the result is baseless rumors and nothing comes of it. There is another ancient Chinese saying, "Three men claim a tiger is in the market," which exactly refers to this situation.</p>
<p>In past years, according to our common sense, once a war breaks out, commodity prices always rise. Also, in times of peace, a shortage of materials also drives commodity prices up; this is the principle. This is all because hard currency is used as the standard. Therefore, the ratio of the amount of currency inflation to the rate of price increase is always roughly equal. However, the era of hard currency as the monetary standard has passed. Today's currency has progressed to the era of national managed currency, where currency serves as a settlement tool for the exchange of goods. In today's era of managed currency, it is a great mistake to still use the thinking of the hard currency circulation era as a yardstick for commodity prices.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the foundation of today's currency value undoubtedly lies in the public's trust in the managers, that is, in the nation's trustworthiness.</p>
<p>However, drawing a curve of commodity prices since last winter, we see that commodity prices rise slowly like climbing a gentle slope, but suddenly rise in a straight line like climbing a steep slope. On the other hand, we do not find that any major events have suddenly occurred internally or externally to the Nanjing government that would reduce the public's trust in the Nanjing government, and be sufficient to cause such a rapid rise in commodity prices. War inevitably increases the consumption of certain materials and often causes a bias in materials; this cannot be denied. However, this reason alone would not cause commodity prices to soar like they are today!</p>
<p>Currently, in the most intense period of the Greater East Asia War, the price of rice in Japan is about 50 yen per koku (approximately equivalent to 1.87 Chinese dou). Converted to reserve coupons, that is approximately less than 150 yuan for one Chinese koku of rice. This is the official price, and all people are given rations of this inexpensive rice. Do not the people cooperate further with the government's policies and voluntarily restrain consumption? Looking at the amount of currency issued, which has inflated to four times that of six years ago, the price of rice is about the same proportion as it was six years ago. Other commodity prices are also roughly equal to the price of rice. From this, we can see that the common sense of our hard currency era has long been invalid in Japan today.</p>
<p>Regarding cotton, we have recently heard that the price in China has reached 10,000 yuan, but in Japan, products are rationed based on a price of 160 yen per tan (approximately equivalent to more than 660 Chinese yuan). The people still automatically practice consumption austerity, even though they are not free and there is not enough of it.</p>
<p>These facts are entirely due to the people's trust and cooperation with the government's policies. Therefore, even during the most intense period of the war, commodity prices are very stable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason for the high commodity prices in China is entirely due to the inconsistency of politics and economics, and a situation of mutual alienation has naturally formed among the people.</p>
<p>According to the Bank of Japan, the amount of currency issued in Japan is approximately 10 billion yen. However, the deposits held by private banks have exceeded 50 billion yen. Deposit currency is five times the amount of currency issued. In addition, postal savings are also more than 50 billion. This situation has the power to arbitrarily adjust commodity prices with monetary policy.</p>
<p>However, in Shanghai, it is rumored that Chinese private bank deposits account for only twenty-odd billion yuan. Although the amount of currency issued has not been officially announced, private deposits are only a fraction of the amount of currency issued. This is the situation in China's only largest economic city. This state of affairs naturally makes financial measures ineffective in commodity price policies, and the authorities' painstaking efforts can also be glimpsed.</p>
<p>Shanghai currently has a distorted state of prosperity. In Shanghai, one of the participating Chinese territories, in Shanghai, the only economic center of China...distorted prosperity inevitably has desires for enjoyment, and the streets are full of joyful sounds of enjoyment. May I ask, is this what the true face of participating China should be? In past years, the working class would not easily have ten yuan in hard currency in their hands, but today, it is very common to have thousands or hundreds of yuan in banknotes. Operators of industry and commerce, thinking that they are very wealthy with hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan in cash, run to places of enjoyment, where the lights are bright and the wine is plentiful, to while away the long nights. Today, Shanghai is full of these nouveau riches.</p>
<p>But if these people want to exchange the reserve coupons they possess for today's goods, they probably cannot get half, or one-third, of the amount they could possess before the war. If they think about the fact that they have more money but fewer goods, probably no one will not feel the sadness of disillusionment!</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the essence of managed currency, in past years, the people of China held hard currency and truly believed it to be real treasure. But now they should know that if there is no managed currency, commodity prices will not be easily and smoothly stabilized, no matter to what extent goods increase. Also, the public should have a strong conviction in the future of the situation in participating China, and the awareness to overcome and cope with the most serious situation. The currency concept that Chinese officials and the public hold today, unknowingly threatening themselves, should be abandoned immediately, and they should work together with one heart and mind towards the construction of a new order in China, and towards economic construction.</p>
<p>The unsettling topic of "What about commodity prices," which makes commodity prices rise higher and higher, should be quickly made to disappear from the streets. This is what we most earnestly hope for. We believe that the moment we no longer hear this topic is the first step towards commodity prices gradually falling and trending towards appropriate stability, because the public's conviction is the foundation of a prosperous and strong country.

<h3>The Japanese Army Has Sunk Eleven American Submarines in the Past Two Months; Guerrilla Warfare in New Guinea Inflicts Heavy Losses on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 3rd that Imperial Navy ships and army and navy air units sank eleven enemy submarines in Japanese waters and other operational waters in January and February.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The enemy, the United States, relying on its material strength, has repeatedly and stubbornly launched counterattacks in the central Pacific region, and enemy submarines are also active. According to the Japanese General Headquarters' announcement on the 3rd, Japanese Navy ships and army and navy air units have sunk eleven enemy submarines since the beginning of this year until the end of February. Of these eleven submarines, five were sunk in January and six were sunk in February, all of which have been confirmed sunk. Among them, some sank immediately because Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and hit the conning tower, while others sank after being bombarded by depth charges from Japanese escort vessels, causing black water columns to rise. Some were immediately sunk when Japanese escort vessels shelled and destroyed the conning tower at night. These enemy submarines appeared in Japanese waters and other areas, attempting to threaten the Japanese supply lines and the transport of important resources from the south to the Japanese mainland, not giving Japan a moment's respite. However, under the close cooperation of the Japanese army and navy, their attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) A telegram from a certain base in New Guinea: The Japanese army stationed on the Ramu River south of Maffu Island in New Guinea, in addition to repeatedly repelling the invading enemy forces and inflicting heavy losses on them, also sends out suicide squads at any time and place to attack the enemy forces, adopting guerrilla tactics, catching the enemy forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses on them. From mid-January to mid-February, in about one month, in that area alone, the enemy ground forces suffered losses of 2,700 men. In the battle near Angor, east of Koroha on the right bank of the Ramu River, the enemy forces suffered casualties of 1,500 men due to the Japanese army's guerrilla tactics. In the battle near Hasna, approximately 1,000 enemy bodies were left behind, and in addition, more than 200 enemy soldiers were seriously injured. Among the damage inflicted on the enemy forces in each battle, there were fewer wounded than killed in action. The reason is that the battles on the Ramu River were mostly conducted in very close-range guerrilla warfare. The brave Japanese soldiers often break into the enemy's flanks with human-bomb attacks. In all of the above battles, the Japanese army's losses were approximately 600 men, far fewer than the enemy's losses. The reason for this is that the Japanese army is carrying out guerrilla warfare in dense forests and mountains.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China for One Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China announced the situation of the two-week battle as follows on the 3rd: The Yu-Communist forces in North China have been annihilated after continuous mopping-up operations by the Japanese army. Only remnants and defeated soldiers have fled to the mountainous areas to temporarily preserve their remaining strength. Recently, those who have realized the error of resisting Japan and have surrendered to the peace movement have emerged in large numbers. That is, Nian Qiujun, a former member of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong Border Region Council, has recently changed his mind and is engaged in the great work of building a new China. At the same time, 700 people under Kong Linai and 400 people under Chu Jinming have also successively pledged their loyalty to the peace movement. On the 29th, the Yu-Communist aircraft came to attack the Anqing area, and after being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, one aircraft was shot down, and the rest fled in panic. Recently, the Yu-Communist forces have suffered extremely heavy losses, but they have still repeatedly increased their forces, and in order to launch air raids on Japanese military bases, they have been actively building air force bases, and at the same time, in order to disrupt the peaceful areas, they have engaged in harassment from time to time with guerrilla tactics.</p>
<p>Stilwell Wounded</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) It is heard that Stilwell, the commander of the Yu-American joint forces, was wounded and fled in embarrassment in the Fugong area when the Japanese army was fighting the Yu army. According to the Ta Kung Pao of the 23rd, Stilwell was recently wounded by Japanese artillery fire while inspecting the front line in Burma. At the same time, the personnel and officers accompanying him also suffered considerable casualties. From this, it can be seen that his injury is indeed true. Stilwell recently went to the front line to supervise the war in order to command the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Chongqing army in the Fugu area. In order to recapture Burma, the British and Americans have only sacrificed Chongqing under Japanese artillery fire. This kind of cunning behavior is intolerable to both gods and men. Stilwell has suffered this punishment for it. This time, the battle on the border between Burma and India has dealt a great blow to the enemy, and now the injury of his important cadre, Stilwell, is tantamount to a double blow.</p>
<h3>Burmese Capture American Pilot Alive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain base on the Burmese front, since independence, Burma has been cooperating with the Japanese army to undertake the construction of the Greater East Asia, and is actively advancing towards the path of destroying Britain and the United States. Recently, a brave Burmese captured alive an enemy American pilot who was trying to escape to Yunnan, which has become an anecdote on the battlefield. That is, on a certain day in February, twelve American Army fighter planes invaded Burmese airspace, and met a Japanese fighter squadron near a certain place in Burma, and launched a heroic air battle, shooting down five of them. At this time, the squadron leader's aircraft of the enemy fighter squadron was severely damaged and caught fire, and fortunately managed to use a parachute to land in a forest north of a certain place and wandered around. Later, he was discovered by a Burmese named Aimon, who lured him to his home and stayed overnight. That night, the man said to Aimon, I am an American pilot, and I am trying to escape to Yunnan. If I can get my wish, I will reward you with one hundred US dollars. On the 17th, Aimon and two other people set off from the place. Because the pilot had a pistol, a clever plan had to be used to hand him over to the Japanese army. After much deliberation, the three people led him to a place about ten miles away from the Japanese army and handed him over to the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Britain Imposes Pressure on Turkey, Halts Supply of Military Goods to Turkey</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the British suspension of military supplies to Turkey, the Associated Press correspondent in Ankara reported on the 2nd that, due to the collapse of recent military talks between Britain and Turkey, there have been frequent rumors in Ankara political circles that the British government will halt the export of military and civilian goods to Turkey, but the Turkish government has not confirmed this news. There is no doubt that the Turkish government faces difficult policy choices in response to this pressure. However, some believe that Britain's adoption of this measure, while abandoning hope for the Turkish government, has other goals in Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a London telegraph report, the British Foreign Office stated the following on the morning of the 2nd regarding the suspension of military exports to Turkey: This statement cannot address whether to suspend the export of goods to Turkey, but the British government's adoption of such a measure would not be surprising. From the perspective of the anti-Axis powers, it is unwilling to waste military supplies on the Turkish government if they are not beneficial to the war against Germany. If the anti-Axis military resources are not used in the war against Germany, they should be transferred to more effective uses.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Guidance Forces</h3>
<p>— Fujiyama Aiichirō</p>
<p>The original author is a naval administration consultant and the chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>Impressions of the War Situation</p>
<p>Two years have passed since the issuance of the Imperial Rescript on the Greater East Asia War. During this time, the economic world has abandoned old habits and transformed into a wartime system. It can be said that everyone involved in industrial economics has changed their way of thinking. Looking back at the situation in the industrial economic world on the eve of the Greater East Asia War, and the mindset of those involved, is completely different from today.</p>
<p>For example, regarding business expansion, in view of the post-war environment, even though it was a national requirement, many people believed that their own companies should be expanded to the minimum extent possible. But today, I think no one holds this view anymore. If it is what the country desires, they will not hesitate to expand to any extent.</p>
<p>In order to formulate concrete plans to enhance war power and prepare enterprises, merchants were convened at the Tokyo Economic Conference to solicit their opinions. Among the businesses themselves, some requested a preparation rate of 50% to 60%, while government officials, thinking from the consumer's standpoint, took pains to adjust and suppress them. Even in the most outdated commercial system, there was lively discussion about the need to adopt a comprehensive distribution system. This shows that the severity of the situation has changed even the minds of the most backward people. Most government officials are united in their advocacy, and if there are still a few whose minds have not changed, the government can provide strong guidance to ensure smooth progress. Therefore, now it is the people and the industrial world who are waiting for the order to launch a general offensive.</p>
<p>In general, the government's guidance often tends to be on the administrative side, lacking boldness. Various national movements also lack consistent spirit, preventing the people from rising up more strongly and causing them to harbor passive worries. Increasing savings and training are necessary, and cultivating leisure activities is also necessary, but in addition to these, a national movement that cultivates a positive spirit is even more necessary. This requires great politics.</p>
<p>The enemy, the United States, has become increasingly proactive since the beginning of the war, with slogans such as "Remember Pearl Harbor" and "Go to Tokyo, Go to Tokyo." In order to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, an aggressive theory of landing operations on the American mainland is essential. Such ambition is necessary. Even in defense, we must be ready to launch an attack at any opportunity. This is what strategists have taught us.</p>
<p>Isn't this kind of positive guidance lacking in today's national movement in Japan? Is this not because the national movement in Japan lacks the ambitious political power? If so, the government and the leaders of the national movement should speak more boldly and directly and provide strong guidance.</p>
<p>All facilities for increasing production are being steadily improved. People engaged in economic industries are deploying their battles on their own fronts. The advance to increase production has already begun. If this advance is vigorous and healthy, it will lead to the path of certain victory.</p>
<p>Only powerful political leadership can change everyone's minds, break down sectionalism, and fill the battlefield of national combat deployment with vitality and courage, moving forward. (Translated by Wei An from the Asahi Shimbun, February 12th)</p>

<h3>Wartime Blackout Implemented in the City Starting Yesterday, Important Talk by the City's Air Defense Headquarters Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters Bureau, regarding the implementation of the blackout, issued the following important statement yesterday: The Headquarters has determined that, in accordance with Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command on the 1st of this month, a blackout will be implemented throughout the city of Shanghai from sunset to sunrise the next morning, starting on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>Implementing Wartime Blackout with Resolute Spirit</p>
<p>What we want to earnestly ask the citizens to pay attention to is that this blackout is completely different from the blackouts that have been held repeatedly in short-term air defense drills in the past. What is being implemented now is a wartime blackout, adapted to the actual war. Citizens must implement it with a resolute spirit, so as to achieve the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Striving to Increase Production and Maintain Night Work</p>
<p>From this day (3rd) on, the blackout should become completely part of the daily life of the citizens of Shanghai. In addition to reading carefully the implementation guidelines listed in the attached table to Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command, not only should we conduct temporary blackouts as in the past during drills, but we should also apply the experience gained in controlling lights. Under the blackout, we must strive to increase production and maintain other night work, and prepare complete and effective equipment to meet the needs of wartime with the greatest determination, and work hard to control lights.</p>
<p>Protecting the Safety of Citizens and Cooperating to Comply with the Measures</p>
<p>Considering the state of activity of enemy Chinese Air Force, Shanghai is at risk of air raids at any time. To protect the Greater Shanghai and ensure the safety of the lives and property of five million citizens, the implementation of this blackout is extremely necessary. The Air Defense Command, from the perspective of combat, is deeply concerned about the implementation of this blackout. If citizens violate the measures, they will be severely punished, and the Civil Air Defense Headquarters will also adopt the same approach. Citizens are urged to deeply recognize this point, and it is hoped that they will not violate the prescribed measures, but sincerely cooperate and comply with the orders of the Air Defense Command.</p>
<p>Submitting Applications for Light Intensity Exceeding Regulations</p>
<p>Also, in accordance with the regulations in the lower half of Article 5 of the Headquarters' Proclamation: Outdoor work lights that have been approved for application shall be in accordance with the various types of lights listed in Schedule 1 of Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command. If it is necessary to use a light intensity exceeding the regulations, citizens should submit applications to the police stations in charge, who will forward them to the Headquarters. The Headquarters will order the police stations to investigate and forward them to the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command for approval. All sectors are requested to comply with these procedures.</p>

<h3>Daily Necessities Plummet in Price, Rice Prices Decrease</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Since the city authorities announced a strict ban on hoarding and speculation, general speculators have become very panicked and have lowered the prices of their hoarded goods to sell them off, leading to a recent decline in the prices of daily necessities on the market. The decline in the prices of matches and soap has been particularly drastic, and the black market price of rice has also fallen sharply, so people's minds have been very stable recently.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Epidemic in the City, More Than 100 Patients, Yongai Yu Hopes Residents to Pay Attention to Health</h3>
<p>The Thaiwu Shi Bao reported that Yongai Yu, the deputy director of the First District Public Office Health Department, in view of the fact that the quarantine hospital in this port has admitted more than 100 patients with meningitis, met with reporters yesterday to advise residents to pay attention to health. Since January of this year, meningitis symptoms have been found in Shanghai, and to date, there have been more than 100 patients, of whom 20 have died of the disease. Dangerous Period</p>
<p>It is reported that meningitis is a highly infectious disease, but it is also very easy to spread in crowded places. It is found that the slaves in the ninth district turned danger into beauty. Some say that the dangerous period of this disease this year has passed, but Yongai Yu said that this is not the case, because the dangerous period of this disease is actually this month. According to the usual situation, the epidemic begins in winter and ends in April.</p>
<p>Three Signs</p>
<p>Dr. Yongai also said that the current meningitis epidemic originated in Zhejiang Province and spread to Shanghai. The authorities have now launched a large-scale vaccination campaign. He also urged residents to visit theaters and trams less often and to gargle regularly every day and wear a mouth shield when going out. There are approximately three initial signs of the disease: high fever, confusion, and stiff neck. If the confusion affects the brain and exhibits a semi-conscious state, then it is undoubtedly meningitis. Finally, Mr. Yongai hopes that the public will take proper precautions to eradicate the source of the disease.</p>

<h3>Household Rice to Be Standardized, White Rice Distributed Uniformly; Under Discussion by Ruling Authorities</h3>
<p>Regarding the allocation of household rice for residents in the city, the authorities, in order to prevent rice shops from taking advantage and causing losses to the citizens, have repeatedly made clear regulations. However, sometimes the regulations are ambiguous, allowing for either white rice or brown rice. Whenever rice shops encounter such opportunities, they reportedly distribute brown rice. If citizens want to exchange it for white rice, they have to exchange it at a 70% rate. This means that receiving two *sheng* of grain actually only yields 1.4 *sheng*. The suffering of the citizens is self-evident, and it provides unscrupulous rice shops with endless opportunities to exploit the situation. The citizens are paying close attention to this issue of food for the people. According to reporters' inquiries to the ruling authorities, the authorities have paid close attention to the above situation and are currently discussing improvements with the relevant agencies. It is proposed that the allocated rice will be uniformly specified as white rice. If, in any case, the purchased grain does contain brown rice, and it is unavoidable to use it for allocation, it will be allocated uniformly at the same time after accumulating for a period, and it will be stated in the announcement to prevent unscrupulous rice shops from taking advantage and engaging in fraud.</p>

<h3>US Military Strategic Failure in the Pacific: Talk by Director Matsushima of the Reporting Department</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Reporting Department in Shanghai, the Fleet Reporting Department, and the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy jointly invited news reporters in the city to a reception at the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 p.m. The attendees included Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi of the Army Reporting Department, Colonel Matsushima and Captain Takeda, and Trustee Sakazuma of the Fleet Reporting Department, Information Director Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukuma of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>US Military Failure in the Mariana Islands</p>
<p>Director Matsushima first delivered a speech, stating: Recently, in the Pacific war situation, the US military's operation in the Mariana Islands has fundamentally failed. The US initially intended to lure the Japanese main fleet into battle, but their plan did not succeed. They then used air power to attack the Japanese army, but also failed, and instead lost multiple aircraft carriers and battleships. It will take considerable time to recover. Observing the strategy used by the enemy, it is using "unorthodox" warfare instead of "orthodox" warfare. Orthodox warfare is a frontal battle by the main fleet, while unorthodox warfare avoids frontal battles. There has never been an unorthodox war that has achieved a major victory. After the army's failure in orthodox warfare in Hawaii, it had no choice but to attempt unorthodox warfare, concentrating air power to cooperate with battleships to attack our army, but the result was heavy damage and retreat.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Studies Sun Tzu's Art of War</p>
<p>Colonel Matsushima said: The Japanese army always follows the Chinese Sun Tzu's Art of War as its guide in combat. Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "Subtle, subtle, to the point of having no form; divine, divine, to the point of having no sound; shape the enemy and I have no form." The Japanese army is good at embodying this principle in combat, so it is always victorious.</p>
<p>Inaccurate Reports in Chongqing's "Sweeping Report"</p>
<p>The "Sweeping Report" in Chongqing on the first of this month claimed: Although the United States has achieved success in the Pacific war, it has not fully understood the Japanese military's true strength. It also said that the United States has eight battleships and multiple aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific, and the Japanese military is very afraid of them. It further claimed that the fleets operating in the Mariana Islands and Truk are two different fleets, all under the command of Major General Mark Mitscher. Colonel Matsushima expressed ridicule for this, saying that the Japanese navy is not only not afraid of the US navy, but can sink them to the bottom of the sea. As for the fleet operating in the two locations, it is actually two in one. The "Sweeping Report" wants to use this to show the greatness of the US navy, which is not worth a laugh from those in the know. Based on this, those responsible for intelligence in Chongqing should quickly study China's Seven Military Classics.</p>
<p>Political Resolution Sacrifices Chongqing</p>
<p>Colonel Matsushima also stated: According to reports from the United Kingdom, regarding the US Navy's delusions, the United States intends to wipe out the Japanese active fleet and then station troops on the Chinese mainland. In fact, this is impossible. It also said that if the European war situation cannot be resolved, then the Pacific war will also be difficult to resolve. Furthermore, a certain important British figure told a certain important figure in Chongqing that after the European war is resolved, the Pacific war should be resolved politically. Observing the above, we deeply feel that no matter how the European war turns out, using political methods to resolve the Pacific war will first sacrifice Chongqing. The so-called "Four-Power Alliance" of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing on the anti-Axis side is actually a trick. Fundamentally, the United Kingdom and the United States do not value the position of Chongqing.</p>
<p>Unanimity of Belief in Victory From Top to Bottom</p>
<p>According to an English-language digest magazine currently published in Chongqing, a reporter described the situation in the Solomon Islands, saying that one time a Japanese warship sank, and a sailor surfaced. An American ship intended to rescue him, but the sailor refused and resisted with weapons. Therefore, the reporter said that the Japanese military's morale is strong and indescribable, and it is not something that the American military can conquer.</p>
<p>The Japanese side's belief in victory is truly shared by everyone, from top to bottom, inside and outside. Recalling that four years ago, when the US Air Force raided a certain city in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, there happened to be three Japanese children playing a god-worshiping game with ancestral tablets on the ground. A bomb landed within ten meters, and the flying dirt immediately buried the three children in the soil. However, it was not long before all three children climbed out of the soil, looking as calm as usual, and were not injured at all, as if aided by the gods. It was truly a miracle. Currently, the soldiers on the front lines of the Japanese army all have a belief in victory blessed by divine power.</p>
<p>Air Defense Measures Necessary in Wartime</p>
<p>Today, the city has implemented permanent lighting control. Colonel Matsushima also elaborated on this, saying: Air defense measures are necessary in wartime. The citizens of Shanghai are not used to this kind of measure, so some rumors have arisen, which is really not appropriate. Also, regarding the recent rumors about Chairman Wang's health, the fact is that a certain Japanese naval attaché recently had a long and pleasant conversation with Chairman Wang at a dinner hosted by Jin Aisheng in Nanjing, during which the Chairman was in good health.</p>
<p>Talk by Director Matsudaira</p>
<p>After Director Matsushima finished speaking, Information Director Matsudaira continued to elaborate on the National Government's hiring of Mr. Ogura as the National Government's economic advisor. Director Matsudaira said: Mr. Ogura is one of Japan's leading industrialists. China and Japan share important responsibilities in the Greater East Asia War. China's mineral resources are abundant. Mr. Ogura's coming to China will make great contributions to increasing mineral production.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Community</p>
<h3>Sufficient Quantity is Still Not Enough</h3>
<p>One of the guidelines of wartime economic policy is the adjustment of prices, which includes the following: "Improve the allocation mechanism and ensure the universality and reasonableness of the allocated quantity to eliminate the black market." At first glance, universal allocation and reasonable quantity seem to be all the necessary conditions for a perfect allocation system. In fact, even if universal allocation and reasonable quantity can be achieved, if there is no way to guarantee the quality, it still cannot meet the ideal conditions of the allocation system.</p>
<p>In today's environment of high prices and difficult living conditions, everyone complains about the insufficient quantity of allocated goods, and at the same time, they complain even more about the poor quality of the allocated goods, so that the achievements gained by the allocation system are just a chorus of complaints. The money is repeatedly exploited and becomes a blood-sucking worm, and the allocation system directly becomes a medium for plundering the interests of the people. For example, let's take the two most essential daily necessities for the people: rice and coal. There is white rice and brown rice, so white rice may all flow out of the back door of the allocation rice shop into the black market for white rice. Allocating coal balls without setting coal ball standards, or even if there are regulations, there is no way to determine their standards, so the coal balls may all become pure mud balls. As a result, everyone feels that the rice cannot be swallowed, and the coal is all ashes and cannot be rekindled. In this way, how can we expect the elimination of the black market for rice and coal?</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's call for strengthening the allocation mechanism, in addition to increasing the types and quantities of allocated goods, we must also pay attention to maintaining or improving their quality. Otherwise, the allocation system will ultimately be unable to resist the black market. Therefore, sufficient quantity is still not enough.</p>
<h3>Food Bureau Orders Associations to Re-register Food Merchants</h3>
<p>In view of the recent soaring prices of various grains in the city, the Shanghai Food Bureau, in order to supervise and manage businesses that comply with government regulations, has determined that all grain merchants in the city must register with the bureau and obtain a certificate before they can operate. In view of the fact that unscrupulous merchants have recently started businesses privately, in order to protect the legal rights of these merchants, the bureau is handling supplementary registration for grain merchants. All relevant grain industry associations (such as the edible oil industry, the food industry, and the miscellaneous grain industry) have successively received orders from the bureau, ordering the associations to notify their members to comply with the order and complete the registration. The deadline for registration is March 31st. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be deemed to have violated the administrative regulations and will be ordered to cease operations.</p>
<h3>Egg Procurement Actively Underway</h3>
<p>According to past practice, the peak egg production season in the Central China region is generally in March each year, but this year's purchase prices remain high, so active procurement efforts are still needed. Approximately 250-260 *dan* are handled each day.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stock Market Conditions</p>
<h3>After Banks Tighten Lending, Hoarding Evils Gradually Increase; Legitimate Industrial and Commercial Businesses Not Affected</h3>
<p>After the Bank Joint Reserve Committee adjusted the lending rates for member banks, in order to prevent the same industry from using the lent funds for speculation and hoarding, it has implemented tighter lending measures starting this year. It will also list the total amount of current deposits of each industry, that is, the amount on which each industry calculates the current deposit reserve to be paid in each month, and submit it to the committee as a standard for revising the lending limit. It is also heard that if the various industries provide property as collateral to apply for loans from the committee within the prescribed limits, it will also be limited to the needs of legitimate business.</p>
<p>At the same time, the various banks had no choice but to tighten their lending to various industries, and their review became even more stringent, completely following the laws and regulations announced by the Ministry of Finance and the restrictive measures stipulated by the banking industry. Since the tightening of lending, due to the urgency of credit, the evil trend of speculation and hoarding has become increasingly apparent, but the loan requirements of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses are still approved in moderation and have not been affected by the tightening of lending.</p>

<h3>My Humble Opinion on the Regulations for Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>According to reports, the hoarding of major commodities will be severely punished. This made me think about how the provisions of the regulations for punishing hoarding can be fully implemented without becoming a mere formality, so as to achieve the practical effect of curbing price increases. This is a major issue. I would like to briefly state my humble opinion on the regulations for adoption:</p>
<p>The word "hoarding" does not originally mean just "collecting." Ordinary people collecting a certain amount of goods for direct consumption naturally does not count as hoarding. However, how much is the direct consumption amount that each household can collect? This should be clearly stipulated. Otherwise, unscrupulous officials will inevitably use the regulations as a tool for extortion. This is a concern that should be seen before it becomes an issue.</p>
<p>Hiding wealth among the people has long been a clear teaching. The fact that there are still commodities that can be capitalized by the market relies entirely on previous collections. Therefore, commodity price increases cannot be blamed on collections, but should be blamed on hoarding and profiteering. The hoarding for profit that is prohibited by the regulations should naturally be interpreted as hoarding and profiteering for the sake of exorbitant profits. If ordinary people collect major commodities, slightly exceeding the amount for direct consumption, and do not intend to seek exorbitant profits, it is still not hoarding and should not be punished.</p>
<p>To prohibit hoarding and profiteering, the first thing to do is to make members of trade associations willing to register their stored goods. The current regulations already stipulate the crime of concealing non-registration. However, merchants are most afraid of losing money, because the government's previous price evaluations were often harsh and there were examples of forced purchases at low prices. Therefore, no one dares to register. Now, if the government changes this strategy and provides a discount interest on the registered commodities and guarantees that a reasonable profit will be obtained when they are sold, then merchants will naturally cooperate in the allocation.</p>
<p>Hoarding to manipulate market prices and disrupt the market is naturally condemned by both humans and gods and should be severely punished. However, what is meant by manipulating market prices? What is meant by disrupting the market? In the application of the regulations, there should be a reasonable and accurate interpretation. Otherwise, law enforcers will arbitrarily distort the meaning and easily wrongly accuse people, and the abuses will be endless.</p>
<p>The punishment for hoarding by civil servants should be more severe than that for ordinary people, but those who do not abuse their power or position should still be treated as ordinary people. However, because of their status as civil servants, they should also be subject to disciplinary action. As for those who cover up manipulation of market prices and disrupt the market, they are all civil servants with special powers. These people can be described as extremely sinful. If the authorities can break through personal connections and impose the death penalty, it will naturally be a sufficient warning to save the declining customs.</p>
<p>Laws alone are not enough to implement themselves, so it is necessary to first complete the investigation, reporting, and judicial enforcement system. The personnel in charge must have the spirit of integrity and impartiality and the unwavering determination to enforce the law. Otherwise, the law will become a mere formality, the punishments will be more severe, the implementation will be more difficult, and it will only provide a tool for officials to extort money. Since the promulgation of the current regulations, there has never been a clear definition of how to adjudicate and enforce them, and the material investigation committee composed of committees dispatched by the relevant authorities is neither dedicated to the matter nor has an independent function, and it is difficult to expect its detailed investigation and impartial reporting. If we want to effectively implement the regulations, we should first improve the system, reorganize the agency and personnel.</p>
<h3>The Future Hope of Mankind</h3>
<p>— Yao Jincheng</p>
<p>Reflections on "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots)</p>
<p>The Hard Work Troupe’s "R.U.R." finally premiered at the Paris Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>Although this is an ideal, the era depicted in the play is set five hundred years into the future. However, it is clearly born from the flowerbed of reality. Therefore, despite its romantic strangeness, it is ultimately a human product. Amidst the dazzling light and shadow, it still evokes a sense of familiarity in the audience.</p>
<p>To what extent will the world progress five hundred years from now? "R.U.R." tells us that the architecture of that time will be completely streamlined, giving people an extremely fluid impression in form. Everything tends toward simplicity and practicality, and is extremely scientific and mechanized. Wireless video transmission is exceptionally realistic. Air temperature is entirely artificially regulated, unaffected by nature. Travel between Earth and other planets is already possible. A kind of rocket has been invented for transportation, capable of flying tens of thousands of miles in minutes... Most importantly, all labor in factories and fields can be replaced by "robots," eliminating the need for human power.</p>
<p>The playwright seems to deeply resent human selfishness and cruelty. Therefore, even in such an era of scientific civilization, people are still filled with various narrow-minded, vulgar, and corrupt ideologies. Society is still in the hands of merchants, and scientists are still subject to various constraints. The author's most ruthless satire is the scene of the robot rebellion. When humanity is on the verge of extinction, the factory's chief accountant frantically tries to bribe the robots with money, hoping to escape.</p>
<p>But innocence, purity, and benevolence ultimately triumph over everything. In the final scene, a pair of young male and female robots slowly ascend into the sky amidst melodious music. The lights illuminate them, making them appear extremely ethereal and dreamlike, like auspicious omens among celestial birds. At this moment, the entire theatre erupts in applause, and the theme of "R.U.R." – the future hope of mankind – is clearly revealed.</p>
<p>The director and actors of this play are all competent and happy. The beauty and moving nature of the set design, costumes, props, and lighting, and the excellence of the musical arrangement, can all be said to be unprecedented. (The author is a student assistant at this newspaper)</p>

<h3>The Garbage Mountain on Dagu Road Accumulates—Urgently Needs Thorough Removal—</h3>
<p>The garbage mountain on Dagu Road, near Tongfu Road in this city, has been accumulating for a long time without anyone clearing it. It obstructs the intersection, making it inconvenient for vehicles to travel. Moreover, it is a busy area, and as the weather gradually warms up, the stench permeates, making it unbearable. It truly affects the health of citizens. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will pay attention to the garbage problem and establish a resolution to prioritize sanitation. (A Citizen)</p>
