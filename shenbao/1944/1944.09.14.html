<p>社評</p>
<h3>五育之重要</h3>
<p>吾人素以教育爲立國之本，故時有所論列以貢獻教育界參考。上學年結束之時，會以[敬終]之態度，提出[教育界應有之反省]以促各方面之自覺，茲當本學年開始之際，再以[愼始]之態度，闡釋五育之重要，以供有心人士之研討。　　五育者，美育德育體育智育羣育之謂，此人所共知，但似已爲人所共忘，蓋[五育]已久爲教育學中之一術語，並非始創於今日，然督導教育者每不問不聞，一部份主持教育者每以營運學費求富，實施教育者莫不岌岌於衣食，身受教育者更不知何以用其心，在此情況之下，又誰有餘緒體念五育之眞詮，於是教育不堪聞而社會國家更不堪聞。爰將五育之平行性連鎖性以及其重點分配性，分述於後，作爲學年更新之獻詞。　　發抒美感怡養性情，是曰美育。正其心之所思慮，範其事之所行爲，是曰德育。輔助身體之發育增進抵抗之能力，是曰體育。灌輸智識發揮智力，是曰智育。予以活動之機會而培養其協和合作之精神，是曰羣育。今社會國家之現象，因不講求美育而凌亂而雜沓，因不講求德育而詭詐而穿　，因不講求體育而贏弱而多病，因不講求智育而陳腐而落伍，因不講求羣育而擊枘而分崩離析如一盤散沙。　　美育爲五育之基礎，認識眞美而後於不知不覺之中能讅人格之美，於是進而可言德育。內心無形之修養必漸流露於有形之外表，是爲健美。且團體操練運動競賽須以道德爲其經緯，拳術武藝槍刺射擊尤須以道德爲之保證，無德育之根基實不能與言體育。以鍛鍊有素之精神與體力，使與大自然無限之[眞]無窮之[理]相接觸，遂不期然而然有偉大神秘之感應，求知之慾望油然而生不可遏制，乃足以與言智育。修養愈深，體力愈堅，智力愈高，則潛能愈大，而欲於事實上加以表現之傾向亦愈強，必也容許小試其鋒因而加以利導使入正軌，故以羣育殿於五育之後，亦即踏入社會實地發生作用之前奏。　　基礎的訓練必施之於幼童，蓋習慣成自然而先入爲主，故對於十歲以下之兒童，須應用種種設備，採取種種方法，且須盡量與家庭合作，務使兒童之思想舉動談吐歡笑，無時無刻不在美的氣氛之中，而輔之以最簡單之德育規律，使知思想行動之大體方針，故小學應以美育德育爲主而以其他三者副之。年齡漸長思想行動之活力亦漸增，但中心無主最爲危險，同時在身體上正趨入發育之階段，故初中應以德育體育爲主而以其他三者副之。此後則體格正屆成熟而求知之慾亦漸旺盛，故應加以嚴格之體格訓練，同時予以充分之基本知識，便成爲健壯優秀之青年，而能担任社會中級幹部之任務，縱不升學亦巳成有用之材，故高中應以體育智育爲主而以其他三者副之。迨升入大學對於體力智力均巳有相當之基礎，應鼓勵其自動研討之興趣，指導其吸收整理之方法，且須訓練其辦事之精神以及人與人相處之節奏，而免驟入社會有徬徨失措之弊，故大學應以智育羣育爲主而以其他三者副之。重點選定則步調一致，一切章程規程之釘定方有所依據，旣無顧此失彼之虞，而收事半功倍之效。　　教育之責任如此之大，教育之內容如此之豐，而曰充當教員爲[無聯]，其誰信之！我國素重師道，對於師道之尊，早巳了悟，而晚近教育界之畸形，實非文化深湛之國家所應有，而貽誤青年貽誤國家貽誤社會，一切的一切均由從事於教育者負其因果上之責任。明乎此則教育界各階層皆知戰戰兢兢　勉從事，而任何事業之前途，庶有好轉之望，吾人應三復思之！</p>
<h3>聯銀與日角簽訂二億元信用借款汪時璟談華北金融益安定</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　國府華北政務委員會經濟總署督辦兼中國聯合準備銀行總裁汪時璟氏，乘此次來日機會，於十三日與日本銀行總裁　澤氏正式簽定二萬萬元之信用借款協定。關於此事，日情報局於是日上午十時發表如次：日本政府爲協助中國聯合準備銀行之健全發展，於昭和十八年（民國三十二年）三月，日本銀行會對之貸出二萬萬元之信用借款，茲復成立二萬萬元之信用借款]。又據汪氏談稱：[與日本政府當局斡旋結果，決定由日本銀行對中聯銀行成立二萬萬元信用借款，因此，深信中聯銀行之基礎愈形鞏固，華北金融必形安定，物價亦可低落。關於此次借款，對日本當局之好意，深表感謝，同時今後決與盟邦日本協力，完遂經濟開發]。　　東京十三日中央社電　日本銀行與中國聯合準備銀行間，十三日簽訂之信用借款協定，要綱如次：○中國聯合準備銀行於本協定成立之日起，得於五年內，自日本銀行借用日本通貨二億元。○中國聯合準備銀行對上項借款，於本協定成立之日起，五年內得一次或分批還清之。○上項借款之提取期間及還清期間，可依日本銀行及中國聯合準備銀行間之協議而延長之。</p>
<h3>小磯首相設宴招待</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日小磯首相十三日正午假首相官邸設宴，招待汪時璟及中國聯合準備銀行發行局長歐陽氏，並有蔡大使作陪。日方除小磯首相外，米內海相，杉山陸相，重光外相兼大東亞相，石渡藏相，藤原軍需相及田中書記官長，三浦法制局長官等亦均出席。</p>
<h3>對華匯兌流言一掃</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日本銀行對中央儲備銀行作四萬萬元之信用借款後，繼又對聯合準備銀行作二萬萬元之信用借款，此足以表明日政府堅持對中國滙兌政策之意。本年三月，閣議決定維持中國通貸安定之聲明，此即其實際之表現，此項貸款，並足以一掃對華滙兌之流言，其意義至爲重大</p>
<h3>澤重光發表談話</h3>
<p>澤總裁談：日本銀行於去歲三月，會與中國聯合準備銀行成立二萬萬元之信用借款，此次復同樣成立二萬萬元借款，以協助健全華北通貨制度。中國聯合準備銀行之業務，最近在華北有飛躍之發展，同時內部組織亦擴大，今後日本銀行將不惜一切，盡力予以援助。重光大東亞相談：中國聯合準備銀行，對華北戰時下經濟之振興上貢獻殊多，實堪同情，日本爲協助其發展，去年會由日本銀行借與二萬萬元之信用借款，茲復作二萬萬元之信用借款。按此項借款與貸與中國儲備銀行具有同一旨趣，此後中國聯合準備銀行之基礎益將鞏固，日本政府爲期其發展，並維持其通貸價格，決不惜以全力協力之。</p>
<h3>緬日軍航空隊轟炸猛昌街</h3>
<p>並向龍陵東南方進攻　　緬甸前綫某基地十三日中央社電　緬甸日軍航空部隊，十一日下午對密集於怒江戰綫猛昌街之渝軍，加以猛烈轟炸，予以甚大損失，同時並攻擊由猛昌街至龍陵公路上之渝軍部隊，其人馬各百，車輛三十輛，完全被炸毀，日機全機安然歸返。　　緬甸前綫某基地十三日中央社電，龍陵西北方之日軍，自進攻怒江方面之渝第十一集團軍以來，六日掃除該方面之渝軍，八晶佔領龍陵黃越公路上之一地（位於龍陵北方），繼向老山方面進擊，另一部日軍於擊潰兩部之渝軍後，即奪取小松山，並自七日指曉起，開始進攻龍陵東南方之渝軍。</p>
<h3>菲島等處空襲隊毀敵機多架</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十三日中央社電　敵機九日空襲民答那峨南部後，十一日下午又以艦載機約百三十餘架，來襲菲律賓中部，被日軍擊落三架。　　東京十三日中央社電　據中部太平洋電，十一日有美機累計三百七十架來襲帛琉島，當地日軍即邀擊之，擊落其五架，擊毀其二架。　　中部太平洋基地十三日中央社電　大寨島·迭尼安島九日夜發現照明彈數十發，顯示日軍部隊尚在奮戰中。　　東京十三日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍基地十二日電，敵Ｂ２４型機編隊，十一，十二兩日來襲南島島，日軍部隊當即邀擊，結果敵機被擊落二架　　北部太平洋十三日中央社電　十日上午，有敵機約九架，兩度來襲北千島之幌筵島，但被日軍擊落擊毀各一架，日軍則無損失。</p>
<h3>定例閣議席上日陸相報告</h3>
<p>東印度民衆感激支援　　東京十三日中央社電　日天皇陛下於第八十五屆臨時議會閉院式終了後，十二日十一時五十分，於宮中正殿賜見小磯首相以下各國務大臣，岡田衆議院議長，佐佐木，內崎貴衆兩院副議長及兩院議員，政府委員等。　　東京十三日中央社電　日小磯首相於第八十五屆臨時議會中，會正式聲明日本政府將來承認東印獨立，杉山陸相於十二日定例閣議席間，基於現地軍政監部之報告，傳達當地民衆之謝意，○爪哇中央參院議長游加孟諾氏，代表爪哇全體民衆，訪問當地日軍最高指揮官，致感謝之意謂，此次接獲小磯首相閣下之聲明，不勝感謝，爲爭求獨立，印度納西亞人已嘗盡種種辛苦艱難，今日聞此聲明，實深感激，印度納西亞人於未完成獨立之前，當與日本一心一德，向必勝之途邁進，即獨立後，仍始終依一貫之方針邁進。○七日上午小磯首相發表聲明時，適有爪哇民衆一千餘名從事營動服務，聞訊後，極表感謝，並高聲歡呼。○首相之聲明乃表現大東亞戰爭之目的，當地軍政當局及一般民衆，於各地舉行感謝祝禱大會。○蘇門答臘回教教長江培氏，向民衆疾呼，由於此次日本之聲明，彼等期望之獨立非爲夢想，同時爲響應日本之誠意，應舉總力向獲得最後勝利之途邁進。○爪哇當地民衆約一萬餘名，九日晨訪問最高指揮官致表謝意。○當地收音機傳之小磯首相聲明，民衆羣集傾聽歡呼。</p>
<h3>渝美空軍已受致命打擊</h3>
<p>日機猛炸丹竹機塲　　東京十三日中央社電　日機隊攻擊敵Ｂ２９型機弱點之技術已隨其攻擊次數而進步，同時日機之邀擊戰術，亦隨之日新月異。八日Ｂ２９型機轟炸滿洲時，因日機巧妙應戰，卒將其來襲之八十架中擊毀四十架之多，爲日機抵制Ｂ２９型機羣之最大戰果。最後並襲擊成都附近之機塲，結果擊毀其四十架。此次最堪注意者，係展開有組織性之邀擊戰，在此情況下，美第二十轟炸隊，僅出動二次，即損失九十餘架。按美空軍自前次空襲日本本土以來，至此次轟炸滿洲，受創甚重，故今後欲再度行動，勢必需要更長之時期。且鑒於前二次日軍之戰果，可知最近期間渝美機之損失，已超過其補充能力。此種緩慢戰法，三週一次或四週一次之轟炸，實與敵方焦慮短期決戰之戰略相矛盾，料彼等將不得已而積極謀求對策。同時在此緩慢之轟炸下，其所期之轟炸效果，由於高度工業團家所具恢復力之龐大，致化歸烏有。今Ｂ２９型機正謀在中國及印度內地之秘密基地敬延殘喘，然因此次日機轟炸成都基地羣，收獲空前未有之大成功，故此種企圖巳成泡影。須知美國除以Ｂ２９型機自中國大陸實施對日空襲外，實別無他途。故今後勢必活用此唯一手段，自不待言。又因Ｂ２９型機浪費大量汽油，無補渝印公路之空中運輸，故需要自印度通達重慶之一通暢路綫，但沿途遭日機邀擊，致渝美空軍損失奇重。　　廣州十三日中央社電　據日軍前綫某基地訊，日軍精銳轟炸機，頃於十二日未明，攻擊渝美有力進攻基地丹竹，進入機塲上空時，即投下照明彈，確認目標後，即對掩護地區及滑走路施以猛炸，因夜間關係其戰果未能確認，諒已予以重創。日機完成任務後，全機安返原防。</p>
<h3>廣州市長就職</h3>

<h3>青浦之行（二）華</h3>
<p>租米折價　　記者循北門大街，直北而行。到了徐家沙·晤見當地保長，據說：[佃戶繳付租米制度，在事變以後的兩年，早已改爲折價制，折價制在地主方面，顯屬吃虧，但在對付一般刁頑之佃戶，固已舍此而無更良好之辦法，因事變之後，佃戶紛紛藉口耕種方面種種困難情形，抗不繳租，於是如有折價之議，其辦法；分爲三個限期，如在第一次限期之內繳租者，所折之價，視市價可有九折之優待，第二次限期內繳租者，則爲九五折，第三次限期內者，則須十足繳租，倘逾第三次限期而仍不繳租者，則明年之田，應由地主收回，任其自種或其他佃戶代種，各無異詞，此制行之數年，尚可相安無事。至於軍米則地主所應攤派部份，統歸佃戶繳納，地主槪不顧問，蓋已在應收之租米項下扣除故邇來地主寶十，益以　忙賦稅等等·其純益尚不足百分之三十五。]　　盜風與賭風　　[尤有一事，可爲殷憂者，殆即盜匪之風，時有所聞，此處幸尚未渡及，匪徒每以黑夜，塗原抹額，呼嘯隳笑，據戶入室，不僅路徑極熟，亦且財物之所在，往往無待詢問，其爲熟人可知。但來去　忽，出入　常，而行動迅捷，防不勝防，確爲可患]。　　九日上午，信步至縣政府，從道旁墻上的標語，可以看出這兒的史縣長是剛調任到渠水去，而下車伊始的卻是黃縣長，走近縣政府門前，看到了第一號佈告，是八月三十一日所張貼的，大意是整傷官吏的例行公事，第二號是重伸禁止賭博和類似賭博的佈告，由此足以想見青浦賭博風氣的一般　　物價一斑　　青浦米價，這幾天已由七千元漲到七千五，糙米則五千至五千五而已，碾米廠如寶昌，日昇等不下三十餘家，碾機軋軋之聲，充耳欲聾，各處米肆之米，無不向碾米廠批　而來，由糙米碾成白米，一轉手之間，價值之縣殊若此，其獲益殆可想見，顧在人工旣昂，木柴亦漲，機油尤貴之條件下，碾米廠蓋自有其可藉之詞。　　從多數人的談話中，可以知道青浦人民，大都是刻苦自安的，譬如肥皂之爲日用必需品這是誰都知道的，但黃浦人卻多數不用肥皂。而魚蝦之類，多數是銷售到上海去的，所以在本地的售價，也就是抬高了不少，鯽魚，鱔魚·河蝦等，大約爲每市斤百六十元，小　魚則約百二十元一斤，鰻魚在飯店燒熟之後，每大盆四段，便要賣三百六十元，聞之咋舌，俗語說：[人窮世富]其此之謂歟！（完）</p>

<h3>美軍抵猶本城向德境推進</h3>
<p>德特別裝配部隊開前綫　　柏林十三日中央社電　德國社訊：美軍坦克車先頭部隊由佛維爾（Ｖerviers在列日東南）向廉堡（Limburg）推進失敗後，美軍司令部於星期一日再度集中較大之部隊，並經數小時激戰後，終於迫令德守軍後退，敵進抵猶本區（Ｅupen在亞琛南，位於德國邊境）然後由該處更向東推進，但德戰車分隊終於在該市鎭之東，力阻敵軍猛攻。由亞琛城（aachen）至梅茲（Metz）一綫，德軍進入西部防地之前方陣地，僅在若干據點發生局部戰事，但梅茲區有熾烈戰門　　柏林十三日中央社電　德國週來編成不少新銳部隊，更編成特殊攻擊戰車部隊，愈加大德軍之威力，該部隊爲十七歲至三十九歲之志願兵，擁有近距離作戰之最新式裝備，該部隊長會告記者，謂指揮此種部隊作戰，最有興味，郭培爾氏之計劃經已實現，本部隊有最新式之裝備及最新式兵器，聞該部隊火速編成後，已迭次出動前綫。</p>

<h3>奎貝克會議開始商討太平洋戰略</h3>
<p>德國問題亦爲討論中心　　里斯本十三日中央社電　據奎貝克電：美總統羅斯福與英首相邱吉爾，於十二日上午協議完畢後，下午召集兩國各軍司令舉行軍事會談，會談內容多爲關於作戰事項，美總統秘書及英宣傳部雖每日會見記者團，但無確報發表。羅邱兩氏就政戰兩略，作政策上之協議，以兩國軍事代表爲中心，商討太平洋反攻作戰之具體方策，尤其如何配置空軍及艦隊，並英軍之任務如何，均屬中心議題。　　瑞典京城三日中央社電　海通社訊：，據美方消息：奎貝克會議發言人今日宣稱，羅斯福邱吉爾今日第一次召集參謀人員會議，討論作戰計劃。</p>

<h3>德寧戰不屈</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：此間所悉各外報之推測，謂羅邱二氏在此次奎貝克會議，擬討論要求德國投降一事，反軸心或亦將仿效威爾遜之十四點，以爲勸降之鉺，但無論如何，姑不顧其諾言如何，其要求終屬荒謬無理。要知目前德國人民之意境，皆已不願忍受無條件投降，每一年輕力壯之德國人皆已抱定抵掣敵人之決心，德國十七歲之青年紛紛向募兵處投効，東部各省民衆參加建築防禦工程，即爲此一精神之佐證也。德國今之從事防禦戰爭，其態度有二：即○皆知反軸心國今之破壞德國城市，即可顯其將實行更甚於凡爾賽條約之苛刻待遇，○德國能出動新軍精銳作戰是也，政府消息靈通人士亦皆謂德軍現有新銳數百萬在枕戈待命中。</p>

<h3>從蘇聯歸來</h3>
<p>絡續開幕的百貨店　　其次，最近在莫斯科的市民生活上引起波動的，係百貨店的開業。自六月二十六日起，開幕的有數家。這實質上也是日用衣料品的商業店。位於首都中央部最大的百貨店是四層建築，其地位約爲日本銀座松屋的二倍。其陳列商品，不下於大東亞戰爭前的日本一大百貨店，洋服，鞋襪鐘錶，文房用具，女子裝身具，廚房用品洋，應有盡有，品質雖相當粗劣，種類則相當豐富。商業飲食店與食料品店不相上下，如其不嫌貴，則除靴，洋服以外，可以無限制購買。靴一千元，女絲襪每雙一百至二百元，手錶（瑞士造）三千元。市民從早晨起就在百貨店外面排隊等候。在這種情形下，蘇聯開設了憑票配給，取值低廉的商店，而一面則無限制出賣價值高得不能置信的漂亮物件之組織，在種種部面開始流行。西伯利亞鐵道上，有食堂車的列車亦不少，自七月十五日起，莫斯科的商業酒塲所組織的食堂車，預定與之聯絡。現在恐怕已經實現了。又據市民傳說，商業理髪店，商業浴堂，亦於最後開業。理髮店不用說，在任何市都很多。男子理髮祇十二三盧布，然無論那一家理髪店，都得排隊等候很久。女子的修指甲亦然，排隊等了很久論輸不到。於是想出了所謂商業理髪店，祇要付了五十至一百盧布的特別理髪費，任何時可以理髪，不必排隊。且可以很仔細。　　莫斯科市內各地的小街，有開放於一般市民的浴室，這行列也很長。而市民所傳的商業浴室，不僅設備漂亮，時間隨便，並且像日本的溫泉塲中所常見，開設家庭浴堂。不過那須付很高的浴費，這就是商業浴室的眞相。這種理髪店與浴堂，是否已經開業，雖不知其詳，但總之，最近的蘇聯，在市民生活的各方面，流行着這種商業性的商店，這是新投下的波致。　　所謂商業性主義的眞意，一言以蔽之，即戰時下蘇聯市民獲得生活手段的方法，先前究竟是封鎖的，差別的，部分的，現在則改變至公開的，無差別的，平等的。不過一口氣上就實現此種轉變，實際上極困難，於是必須定下特別高的價格，加以國民所看不到的差別與限制。開設於俄京的商業飲食店，商業酒塲，百貨店等，目前似祇限於莫斯科，但這些都可視爲從衣食料品的憑票配給制度轉變到公開商店中的自由配給制度之準備。　　用上面所舉的高價，吸收國民之間的購買力，而漸次減低價格，最後則停止憑票配給，而改變到這些公開商店的自由購買制度。現在莫斯科的商業食料品店，商業酒塲，自開店後僅二個月，巳第一次實行減低價格大約爲十五%。　　離莫斯科時，據市民傳說，自八月一日起，除麵包外，一切配給均停止，而代之以商業食料品店的自由購買制。究竟是否依此實行呢？假使這樣，則蘇聯當局，不是在國民生活的一部份上，着手將戰時經濟改換至平時經濟嗎？這是頗饒興味的問題。（翔：譯自八月二十日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>戶口米停配說不確</h3>
<p>中華日報問：外傳戶口米再發二期後，即行停止，此語是否可靠？答：戶口米不致停止配給，外間所傳不確。</p>
<h3>交通情形頗爲不良</h3>
<p>平報及中央社上海分社間：最近本市交通情形頗爲不良，若干以前不准停車之塲所，現均准予停車，以致影響交通，聞此種塲所附近之警察，且有向停放車輛者索取停放費，四川路橋警察對過往車輛，亦有同樣所爲，市府對此將如何整飭？答：市府將成立交通改善委員會，由市府公用局及警察局等有關機關共同組織，各項章則經巳擬妥，不日即可頒布，經此種聯絡整理，本市交通上各項困難，當可逐漸解決。</p>
<h3>南市垃圾堆積如山</h3>
<p>中華日報問：南市垃圾堆積如山，氣味甚惡，何以未予清除？答：南市垃圾會由市衛生局負責清除，近日因清潔伕要求加薪，一時未獲解決，以致垃圾復行堆積，刻加薪已圓滿解決，市衛生局即可加緊予以清除。</p>
<h3>提高警察待遇問題</h3>
<p>中華日報問：本市市政統一後，警察待遇間最近亦將予以統一，並設法增薪此說，是否可靠？答：關於提高警察待遇問題，諮詢委員會會有建議，本府決考慮予以提高，惟警察待遇提高後，每月勞必增加巨額之支出，不能不從整理稅源着手，問題並不簡單，刻正在妥愼研究，以求早日實現</p>
<h3>領用車照須付小費</h3>
<p>申報問：最近各中外報紙，均會揭載關於領用車輛牌照，須付黑費消息，希望加以禁止。答：此事在公用局方面，已盡力澈查，先後將查出作弊之職員二十餘名，予以開除，希望市民以後盡量以事實同該局檢舉，以協助主管當局整頓。</p>
<h3>娛樂塲所逾時營業</h3>
<p>中華日報新中國問：本市娛樂塲所大多不依照規定時間打烊，望當局切實取締。答：娛樂塲所營業時間規定至下午十時爲止，惟各該塲所於打烊後，尚需半小時之清理工作，如超過此時間者自當嚴加禁止。聞若干娛樂塲所，如舞應之類，於熄燈時間過後，尚有以其他燈光繼續營業者，實屬不法，正調查取締中。</p>
<h3>各縣區軍警米問題</h3>
<p>中央社上海分社問：各縣區征收軍米，收價頗不劃一，其中難免發生舞弊，市府當局對征收軍米一事，是否有改進辦法？答：市府會於去年冬季通令各區公署·征收軍米，但因流弊頗多·成效不大，現已通令停止征收。嗣後將於每一縣區設立軍警米管理委員會·由各該縣區官紳會同軍警政主管人員合作主持，各縣區軍警米問題，可望妥善辦理。</p>
<h3>特稅舞弊辦理情形</h3>
<p>中央社上海分社問：特稅處職員舞弊案，辦理情形如何？答：特稅舞弊案，牽連之人數甚衆約有五六十名，警察局主管方面，經將偵查結果，書面報告市長，俟市長審核後再行決定。查此種舞弊之發生，主要原因爲特稅征收制度之不健全，茲已將特稅科改爲特稅處，本月十六日即可成立，今後將一面以新的方法推進工作，使商民不致逃避捐稅，一面嚴訂獎懲規則，以激勵經辦人員認眞服務，相信經此整理後，特稅收入，當可增多，而積弊亦可清除。　　至此吳秘書長因公先退，遂由各報社記者提出關於今後舉行記者例會之意見，決定每星期一次，由各局處長輪流出席報告，至十一時半始行散會。</p>

<p>氏，十二日因公來滬，昨日與本市各界要人懇談，下午並接見記者，就最近滿洲國情況以及中滿間各項問題，發表談話如次：　　自事變發生以還，滿洲國建設，對於一切非戰時性者，俱置於次要地位，例如美化都市建設計劃等，目下已在中止進行，一切建設，均以增強戰力之重工業爲目標。今年實行之第二次五年計劃，亦着重于重工業與發展更速。美空軍數度來襲鞍山方面，由此可見敵方如何恐懼滿洲國工業之日益發展。今年農產物收成，預料更較去年豐稔。此於中滿兩國間貿易，亦有良好影響，關於中滿間關係，自本人之願望言，首在兩國間文化交流·蓋中滿關係在於同文同種，但於文化方面，對於中國亦應以兄事之，故中國之健全的新文化，必須不絕介紹在滿洲國，此舉於滿洲國之發展有極大貢獻，同時可以加強兩國民心的靭帶。</p>

<p>工部局華童各學校的教職員，似乎築起了深溝高壘，使外界人不易　指。試看一九四三年正月申請登記人數，無論中學小學，均超過二千名以上，但實際任用者，十不及一，推其原因，不外教師之選擇煩難嚴格，而待遇則顯較國內一般同級之學校爲優。因此趨之者衆，而錄用者鮮。茲分述各項特點如次：　　人員任用之煩難　　一，任用之手續　教育處及各學校備有教職員申請登記表，申請人可逕往具領，不取費用。塡明登記表後，連同證件（或副張）照片，送交希望之學校，校長就需要而加以甄別，認爲合格的，然後再向教育處長推鷹，但推薦時並非一紙函件而已，必須介紹申請人，面謁教育處長，作簡單之談話，如教育處長同意，再經下列手續，始得聘爲試用教員。　　甲·由教育處長函請衛生處免費檢騐身體，此種檢騐，非常認眞，除照Ｘ光或加透視身體內部外，再由衛生處副處長等，親自查騐，即談唾小便之類，均加化騐，非得衛生處滿意之報告，不准試用　　乙·由教育處長·將申請教師的資格及學騐等情形·報告總辦處·附同證件·請求覆核·如總辦處認爲有問題·即不得試用。　　以上兩點，決非官樣文章。普通以爲教師經教育處長或校長核准任用後，即無問題。而華童學校，往往因身體資格關係，無論如何，不得聘用。試用時期·普通爲三個月，照支薪給·校長在其試用時間，自然特別加重視導的工作。　　惟根據中國習慣·教師應由學校當局·或行政當局·自動的聘請飽學之士，來就教職。倘全部在登記申請中物色人才，是否範圍過狹，實應注意之問題也。　　二·聘用教師的條例　　華童學校教師等級·中學分一·二·三·四·四等，凡歐美大學畢業·得有學位，而有教學經騐者列一等。國內大學畢業，得有學位，而有教學經騐者列二等。專門學校或高級師範畢業而有教學經騐者三等，本校畢業而有教學經騐者四等。小學分一二·三·三等，凡國內外大學教育學院或教育系畢業得有學位，並有三年以上之教學經騐，有相當之著作者列一等，大學畢業，得有學位而有教學經騐者二等，專門學校，高等師範，或高中師範科畢業，而有教學經騐者三等。此種資格之限制極嚴，可說從無例外，從不通融·亦從無人敢作嘗試越級之請求。年前華人教育處，會訂立小學教師聘用辦法，舉爲圭臬，茲將聘用教員，其資極及教育經騐之規定一點，列述如次。（指二級以下之教員）　　甲·應聘教員，必須高中師範或舊制師範畢業，或大學畢業，而有師資訓練者。　　乙·應聘教員，至少必須有一年之小學教學經騐者。　　丙·應聘教員，其年齡必須在二十四歲以上四十歲以下者。　　丁·應聘教員，必須擅長國語者。　　實際上，小學校長出缺，全由教備主任（即一級教師）升任，而教備主任出缺，則由資格符合之優等教師升任之。　　總上各點，可見前工部局華童學校的教職員，其任用手續之麻煩，以及選擇之嚴厲愼重了。（註四）</p>
<h3>最猛烈戰局中爭取最後勝利</h3>
<p>出淵部長發表談話　　盟邦日本在滬陸軍部報道部所主持之定例報道常會，於昨（十三）日下午三時，假南京路外灘華懋飯店八樓，接見本市中國新聞記者，出淵報道部長躬親偕同赤星囑托蒞會，即席就大東亞戰局的現狀，及敵方失利焦燥惶懼不安狀態，闡明綦詳，最後並謂最後勝利，當從最猛烈的戰局中爭取，決定勝敗，乃在最後之五分鐘的決門。茲將出淵部長談話內容，分誌如次：</p>
<h3>反晨曲敵方焦燥不安</h3>
<p>出淵部長首謂，關於大東亞戰爭的現狀，在最近帝國臨時議會席上，陸海軍大臣報告戰況詳盡，在局部上，日軍已獲得相當成就及戰果，而在大局上觀之，其前途猶賴進一步的努力，以克復尚有之困難，特別於太平洋方面，敵美空軍，竟自本月九日起，向菲律賓之南部及中部，作大舉空襲。顯然因美總統羅斯福企圖競選連任，出此盲目轟炸之渺小結果，及擬對日展開積極反攻之夢想，以挽回民心。此項舉動之用意，不外爲軍事及國內政治的玩弄手段，是以如此的措置，殊不值得注目者。同時最近羅斯福邱吉爾在魁北克之再度會談，而敵方又連續不斷的宣傳，以商榷對日反攻作戰具體計劃，作爲幌子，所謂彼輩反攻之反映，愈焦急而越無辦法，益暴露敗戰之弱點，故是項情形，我人當必須明瞭認識之，關於彼此決戰形勢，日漸有利於日本，米內海相在議會上披瀝在今後作戰上，深　信已具有各項確定之必勝方策，值茲決戰階段之時足爲金玉良言，意義殊深信已具有各項確定之必勝方策，值茲決戰階段之時足爲金玉良言，意義殊深，對優利日本刻劃形勢，非常顯明，並由此足以反映敵方之焦燥不安情形。</p>
<h3>大陸作戰非常順利</h3>
<p>更有一點，可使敵方感到惶恐不安威脅，即中國大陸戰塲的戰局，因有人感認大陸戰局結束之時足以決定大東亞戰爭的歸趨。查大陸戰綫優利態勢，自日軍攻克衡陽後，即沿湘桂鐵路向西推進，一路非常順利，充分發揮日軍威力。於本月六日子夜起至七日晨止，先後攻領敵美在渝空軍之前進根據地零陵據塲及市街，一面仍沿公路繼續猛烈進擊，終於在九日，日軍發揮日軍威力。於本月六日子夜起至七日晨止，先後攻領敵美在渝空軍之前進根據地零陸據塲及市街，一而仍沿公路繼續猛烈進擊，終於在九日·日軍精銳部隊突入廣西省境，進抵桂省之內，故以大陸戰塲而言，日國從湖南等一帶之華中地區，推進至中國西南地區，此項空前之高速度，實爲自事變以來首次所見之戰局。因於大陸戰塲之積極推進，給於渝方影響重大。同時對於反軸心方面及在渝美空軍之影響至巨，彼輩情形狼狽不勝枚舉，單以敵美輿論，對日軍距桂林僅百餘里公路之威逼惶恐不安狼狽語調姿態，更呈恐懼心理。在另一方面上海日軍部隊在浙東開始行動，從金華出發，首將敵美在渝空軍根據地之麗水，加以佔領並仍調續沿甌江向東推進作戰·於本月九日上午九時完全佔領溫州，日大本營於十一日下午四時正式發表。按重慶喪失溫州對渝方之第三戰區影響打擊，非常重大，而駐渝英美新聞記者對日軍進入桂省一點，重視異常，並預料日軍即將長驅直入雲南貴州，每一外籍記者，均撰述通訊，刺激本國輿論，我人再觀美在渝空之逐漸喪失空軍根據地，在今後之行動上及空戰之力量上，遭受致命打擊。</p>
<h3>日軍防空發揮威力</h3>
<p>敵美空軍之挾持所謂優良利器，傾心依賴Ｂ２９型超重轟炸機之航逐率，滿以可以空襲日本土及滿洲方面，然Ｂ２９型之性格，並不如理想之所及，殊不足一視。蓋上次空襲北九州時，可見日軍防空部隊之威力戰果，同時敵美空軍之又襲滿洲，在歸途上被日空軍之邀擊，毀落頗多，實不堪一擊。嗣後日空軍即於當日晚上在漫漫黑夜中，遠襲成都，獲得偉大戰果，故以彼輩情形決不能充分發揮效能，是以敵方誇耀之如此精銳戰門機，經日軍之猛擊下，不堪被擊之喘弱性，充分暴露無遺，彼輩前進根據地之處處喪失，焦燥不安程度，已超逾我人之預料。</p>
<h3>堅定最後勝利信念</h3>
<p>復根據重慶電訊稱·防衛麗水之渝軍在斯一役中·團長當塲戰死·營長二名因渝政權之震怒，被扣審鞫，麗水失守之責任，終於在本月六日在永和受軍法會議之審判，判處死刑，當日執行槍決。故渝政權對日軍之攻擊，深感不安。總之，大東亞戰爭不論在中國大陸戰塲，或太平洋戰塲，每日展開更猛烈之決戰。其戰局事態，不容說當更顯著緊張，故最後勝利乃從最猛烈之戰局中爭取，而決定勝敗，亦即最後五分鐘之決門。再查敵方之思想戰，英美誇耀宣傳，在此時代最爲活躍，假如對最後勝利信念，稍具動搖，則眞給敵方絕好機會。目前戰局的歸趨，自然頗爲明顯。部長末了又憶及西層一九四○年夏時，英遭受鄧扣克之慘敗，國民在雖敗之餘，仍始終繼續堅定勝利信息，如英國民之堅強態度，雖爲敵人之信念，然亦值得我人之效法云云。</p>

<h3>海關組織芻議</h3>
<p>— 汪邁</p>
<p>現行海關組織仍困　海關初創時之全英國式敵性制度，未知改革，其最大缺點，在故意分成內勤及外勤二部，不若盟邦日本之不分內外而工作互相構通。目前海關當局大可效法上海警察局組織，即外勤人員可隨時調至局內服務，而局內人員亦當隨時派出工作，現役人員不論在內在外，一律穿着制服，以重視瞻，而增強自尊心與責任心。　　按目下一海關高級稅務員月支薪二三萬元，而所做工作不過於報關單件上抄一船舶號數之類，且有時竟有一連三四年做此毫無重要之工作者，其實此等簡單工作，大可由大批月支萬餘薪水之低級女職員爲之。一方面可隨時利用抽派月支巨薪之高級人員。內外勤之分界，當立即取消，担任對關稅收入最有關係之監查估騐等最重要勤務。蓋最重要之工作必須由月支巨薪之高級人員爲之，較爲妥嘗。因月支巨薪之高級人員，都係已經服務十年廿年之久，有儲蓄金養老金等利害關係，且大都有家室之顧忌，爲非作弊當較現在大都外勤人員都由廿歲左右剛是中學生來者爲尠。　　又照目下制度，外勤監查人員不論何時何地，皆做監查工作，不肖運輸報關商人，自易與此輩勾結，包庇走私，偷漏關稅，破壞統制，故祇有效法日本，取消內外勤階級制，由海關長每日親自指派各關員服務地點，勤於調動，則事前接洽飛貨等弊，或能減免。且內外界限取消後，目下工作輕微，清閒之內勤高級人員出勤後，查騐陣容增強，一旦耳目衆多，則少數爲非作歹之輩，或稍知歛跡乎！</p>
<h3>法律問題質疑</h3>
<p>— 唯一</p>
<p>我服務於雁蕩路中職大樓經租處，本處與東亞體育專科學校爲遷讓事涉訟，前奉上海地方法院判決確定並發執行命令，對債務人東亞體育專科學校及遠法占有人東亞中學，強制執行遷讓出屋，業經會同法院吏警及保甲長被執行人等到塲執行完畢，具結收回系爭房屋，案已終結。嗣於九月八日忽又由東亞中學會同法院吏警交閱院長所發命令，及該院書記官通知書，對對前次執行完畢之房屋，因憑被執行人一紙狀稱，飭即暫行恢復原狀，再行核辦等因。查執行事件，依照現行強制執行法第十二條第一項之規定，終結以後，本不得提起異議，執行法院亦毌庸再爲任何之命令及處分。今上海地方法院對於執行完畢事件，再發恢復原狀之命令，究不知何所根據？唯一蕞爾小民，一知半解，當時不敢抗拒，事後罔知適從。惟因前項事件，開司法界未有之先例，事關切身利害，海上又爲法界先進薈萃之區，用敢將經過情形函請賜登貴報，公開徵求意見，幸乞當代法界鉅子賜函指示，以便有所遵循，不勝感盼之至。</p>
<h3>周景西居士購保富法贈親友</h3>
<p>乾長紙號周景西居士，得本處發售聶雲臺先生所著[保富法]而讀之，畫中列舉某氏以積善而興，某氏以積不善而亡，某氏之滿而不溢，所以長守富也，某氏以爲富不仁，悖入而悖出也，喟然嘆曰，因果歷歷，股鍳不遠，勸善懲惡，誠莫切於此矣。乃體念親意，向本處購買二千本，計值二萬元，分送親友，以廣流傳，是固有益於風教育焉。本處舉辦六項社會事業：○濟貧金，○苦兒助金，○醫藥助金，○小學教師醫藥助金，○貧婦助產金，○小本貸金，皆以救濟貧病，矜卹孤苦爲宗旨，如蒙濟濟捐助，保富以仁，亦爲富有之家，散財最良機緣也。</p>

<h3>雷雨（三）</h3>
<p>好幾天來，眞像夢境一標。　　八日將近上午，隆夫聽到宣戰大詔時，心頭鼻際發酸起來，眼眶中滿盛着熱淚。不久後，夏威夷的空襲大戰果，局部發喪了。他舉奮得在自己的凳子上坐不住。　　（果然像我所想像。假如眞人適合於航空，或許早已參加此次戰爭了。）　　隆夫這樣替眞人可惜。　　想到這一點時，飛田中校的形體，突然出現於他的房間了。　　[恭禧！恭禧！]　　隆夫站起來，而慶祝大戰果了。　　[恭禧！恭禧！但對於你本身也有可恭禧的地方呵。]　　中校的白色面孔上浮現出微笑來。　　[對於我?]　　[是的。因爲你的工作有了。課長讓你畫在雜誌報章上發表的空襲夏威夷圖。]　　隆夫突然說不出話來，只是望着中校的面孔。　　[是第一次工作。好好幹吧！但在下午六點鐘要交卷！]　　於是中校的形影，就消逝於門外了。　　（可好了，機會到了！）　　隆夫的身體顫傈着，寸刻必爭地開始準備了。旣然是報章用的銅版畫，那末只是黑白兩色就夠了，但身爲報道部囑託畫家，畫出宮事錯誤來是不應當的。把畫紙敷好，再把軍艦類型照片簿重新仔細看了一遍，以免過去萬一有錯誤，然後再把帝國海軍的雷擊機和轟炸機，由各個角度所撮的照片，也熟視一番，於是便在另一張紙上作一設計。　　或許是因過於性急關係，而畫紙稍有高低不平的地方。但因時間業巳迫近，所以就不顧三七廿一地動筆了。於是他開始用鉛筆素描了。是海軍飛機，從眞珠灣的高山上向上俯瞰的一張猛襲圖。炸彈激起的水柱，中彈傾斜的敵艦，府動及盤旋的日本飛機，都唯妙唯肖地畫在紙面上了。　　在指定的時間前二十分鐘，隆夫的第一次工作完成了。　　（他媽的，眞難看！）　　隆夫看着自己的畫，敲着自己的頭顱這樣想。（一四一）</p>
<h3>聖約翰大學設立農學院之經過</h3>
<p>上海市之肥田粉業同業公會，於去年春間成立，其間會員槪係以前亞細亞卜內門怡和愛禮斯茂隆等洋行在江浙皖省各縣之經理人，其理事長爲周慶恩先生，理事有錢德三楊春華胡翔耀翁志斐嚴鵬飛諸先生等，該會會員因經理肥田粉業，對於中國之農業改進貝有莫大之希望與熟誠，均以此時急宜造就一輩高深科學的人材，俾戰局定後即可爲農業界服務，乃與該會顧間徐正鏗先生商定，集資設立一農科大學，並得社會名流項康元沈嗣良陳彬龢及故張一鵬先生等之贊助及專家王企華張偉如趙武諸先生之協力。惟募集所得，僅五百萬元，欲自立一農科大學，其科學研究之設備，勢難全具，因與聖約翰大學接洽，請以捐資添設一農實騐夙稱完美，如可合用則捐資就草創所需之農學設備，似尚勉可購置。經該校校董會鄭重考慮，完全明瞭肥田粉業同業公會諸君盛意而後接受此建議。現在籌備進行，已將屆正式開學之期。</p>
<h3>建華農業協進會之組織</h3>
<p>肥田粉業同業公會諸君又以此次捐款尚係興學之初步，今後籌資尚須努力，故另組中國建華農業協進會，以爲後援，惟教育事業需款浩繁，聖約翰大學旣添設農學院，其開支亦將大增，非中國建華農業協進會之區區捐款所能善後濟事，仍望社會善士共襄盛舉，如圖書設備或爲農牧試騐之塲地，其爲資金或實物皆所祈求。該院農牧塲暫以校之運動塲充之，自非久計，急待另置，未識有無聞風應求者否。上海市肥田粉業同業公會諸君，有此熱誠興學之雅，旣組中國建華農業協進會，復得聖約翰大學之允可而得實現其事，似不可不略紀緣起以誌紀念並補史乘。</p>

<h3>The Importance of the Five Educations</h3>
<p>We have always considered education as the foundation of a nation, and therefore often discuss and contribute ideas for the reference of the education community. At the end of the last school year, with a spirit of "[Honoring the End]," we proposed "[Reflections That the Education Community Should Have]" to promote self-awareness in all aspects. Now, at the beginning of this school year, with a spirit of "[Being Careful at the Beginning]," we will elaborate on the importance of the five educations for the study of those who are interested.</p>
<p>The five educations are commonly known as aesthetic education, moral education, physical education, intellectual education, and social education. However, they seem to have been forgotten by everyone. The "[Five Educations]" have long been a term in education, not newly created today. However, those who supervise education often do not ask or hear about them. Some who manage education seek wealth through operating tuition fees. Those who implement education are constantly worried about food and clothing. Those who receive education do not even know how to use their minds. Under these circumstances, who has the spare time to appreciate the true meaning of the five educations? As a result, education is unbearable to hear, and the society and the nation are even more unbearable to hear. Therefore, the parallelism, the interconnectedness, and the emphasis distribution of the five educations are described below as a dedication to the new school year.</p>
<p>Expressing aesthetic sense and cultivating temperament is called aesthetic education. Correcting the thoughts of the heart and regulating the behavior of actions is called moral education. Assisting the development of the body and enhancing the ability to resist is called physical education. Instilling knowledge and developing intelligence is called intellectual education. Providing opportunities for activities and cultivating the spirit of coordination and cooperation is called social education. The current phenomena in society and the nation are chaotic and disordered due to the lack of emphasis on aesthetic education, deceitful and cunning due to the lack of emphasis on moral education, weak and prone to illness due to the lack of emphasis on physical education, outdated and backward due to the lack of emphasis on intellectual education, and disjointed and disintegrated like a pile of loose sand due to the lack of emphasis on social education.</p>
<p>Aesthetic education is the foundation of the five educations. Only by recognizing true beauty can one unconsciously appreciate the beauty of personality, and then one can talk about moral education. The invisible cultivation of the inner heart will gradually be revealed in the visible appearance, which is called healthy beauty. Furthermore, group exercises, sports, and competitions must have morality as their guiding principle. Boxing, martial arts, and shooting with guns and bayonets must be guaranteed by morality. Without the foundation of moral education, one cannot talk about physical education. By using a well-trained spirit and physical strength to contact the infinite "[Truth]" and the infinite "[Reason]" of nature, one will naturally have a sense of greatness and mystery, and the desire for knowledge will arise spontaneously and uncontrollably, which is sufficient to talk about intellectual education. The deeper the cultivation, the stronger the physical strength, and the higher the intelligence, the greater the potential. The tendency to express oneself in reality becomes stronger. It is necessary to allow a small test of one's abilities and then guide them into the right track. Therefore, placing social education after the five educations is a prelude to entering society and having a practical effect.</p>
<p>Basic training must be given to young children because habits become natural and first impressions are important. Therefore, for children under the age of ten, various facilities and methods must be used, and cooperation with families must be maximized to ensure that children's thoughts, actions, speech, and laughter are always in an atmosphere of beauty, supplemented by the simplest rules of moral education to make them aware of the general direction of thoughts and actions. Therefore, primary schools should focus on aesthetic and moral education and supplement them with the other three. As age increases, the vitality of thoughts and actions also increases, but the lack of a central focus is most dangerous. At the same time, the body is entering the stage of development. Therefore, junior high schools should focus on moral and physical education and supplement them with the other three. After that, the physique is reaching maturity and the desire for knowledge is gradually increasing. Therefore, strict physical training should be given, and sufficient basic knowledge should be provided to become strong and excellent young people who can take on the tasks of middle-level cadres in society. Even if they do not go on to further education, they have become useful talents. Therefore, senior high schools should focus on physical and intellectual education and supplement them with the other three. By the time they enter university, they have a considerable foundation in physical and intellectual strength. They should be encouraged to automatically study and discuss their interests, guided in the methods of absorbing and organizing, and trained in the spirit of doing things and the rhythm of interacting with people to avoid the drawbacks of being confused and at a loss when entering society suddenly. Therefore, universities should focus on intellectual and social education and supplement them with the other three. Once the focus is selected, the pace is consistent, and the fixing of all regulations and procedures has a basis. There is no need to worry about taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, and the effect of achieving twice the result with half the effort is achieved.</p>
<p>The responsibility of education is so great, and the content of education is so rich, yet they say that being a teacher is "[unrelated]." Who would believe it! Our country has always valued the way of the teacher, and has long understood the respect for the way of the teacher. However, the deformity of the education community in recent times is not what a country with profound culture should have. Misleading young people, misleading the country, and misleading society, all of it is the responsibility of those engaged in education. If this is understood, then all levels of the education community will know to be cautious and strive to engage in it, and there will be hope for improvement in the future of any cause. We should think about this again and again!</p>
<h3>Liên Ngân Signs a Two Hundred Million Yuan Credit Loan Agreement with Japan; Wang Shijing Discusses the Increased Stability of Finance in North China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Wang Shijing, Supervisor of the Economic Affairs Department of the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government and President of the United Reserve Bank of China, took the opportunity of his visit to Japan to formally sign a credit loan agreement of 200 million yuan with Mr. Sasaki, President of the Bank of Japan, on the 13th. Regarding this matter, the Japan Information Bureau announced the following at 10:00 a.m. on the same day: "In order to assist the sound development of the United Reserve Bank of China, the Bank of Japan had lent it a credit loan of 200 million yuan in March of Showa 18 (32nd year of the Republic of China). Now, a credit loan of 200 million yuan has been established again." According to Wang, "[As a result of negotiations with the Japanese government authorities, it has been decided that the Bank of Japan will establish a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank of China. Therefore, I deeply believe that the foundation of the United Reserve Bank of China will become more solid, the finance in North China will become more stable, and prices can also be lowered. Regarding this loan, I express my deep gratitude for the kindness of the Japanese authorities. At the same time, I am determined to cooperate with allied Japan in the future to complete economic development]."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The main points of the credit loan agreement signed between the Bank of Japan and the United Reserve Bank of China on the 13th are as follows: ○ The United Reserve Bank of China may borrow 200 million yuan in Japanese currency from the Bank of Japan within five years from the date of establishment of this agreement. ○ The United Reserve Bank of China shall repay the above-mentioned loan in one lump sum or in installments within five years from the date of establishment of this agreement. ○ The withdrawal period and repayment period of the above-mentioned loan may be extended upon agreement between the Bank of Japan and the United Reserve Bank of China.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Koiso Hosts a Banquet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso hosted a banquet at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 13th to entertain Wang Shijing and Mr. Ouyang, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the United Reserve Bank of China, accompanied by Ambassador Cai. On the Japanese side, in addition to Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of the Navy Yonai, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, Chief Secretary Tanaka, and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Miura also attended.</p>
<h3>Rumors about Exchange Rates with China Swept Away</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - After the Bank of Japan made a credit loan of 400 million yuan to the Central Reserve Bank, it then made a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank. This is sufficient to show the Japanese government's intention to adhere to its exchange rate policy towards China. In March of this year, the cabinet decided to maintain the stability of Chinese currency. This is the actual manifestation of this decision. This loan is also sufficient to sweep away rumors about exchange rates with China, and its significance is extremely important.</p>
<h3>President Sasaki and Minister Shigemitsu Issue Statements</h3>
<p>President Sasaki said: "The Bank of Japan established a credit loan of 200 million yuan with the United Reserve Bank of China in March of last year. This time, we have established a loan of 200 million yuan again to assist in the sound currency system in North China. The business of the United Reserve Bank of China has recently developed rapidly in North China, and its internal organization has also expanded. In the future, the Bank of Japan will spare no effort to provide assistance." Minister Shigemitsu of Greater East Asia said: "The United Reserve Bank of China has made many contributions to the revitalization of the economy in wartime North China, which is truly commendable. In order to assist its development, Japan lent it a credit loan of 200 million yuan last year. Now, a credit loan of 200 million yuan has been made again. This loan has the same purpose as the loan to the Central Reserve Bank. In the future, the foundation of the United Reserve Bank of China will be further consolidated. The Japanese government will spare no effort to cooperate in order to promote its development and maintain the price of its currency."</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Reports at Regular Cabinet Meeting</h3>

<h3>Chongqing-US Air Force Has Suffered a Fatal Blow</h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Danzhu Airfield</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The technology of Japanese aircraft attacking the weaknesses of enemy B-29 type aircraft has improved with the number of attacks, and the interception tactics of Japanese aircraft have also been updated day by day. When B-29 type aircraft bombed Manchuria on the 8th, due to the skillful response of Japanese aircraft, they shot down as many as 40 of the 80 attacking aircraft, which was the greatest achievement of Japanese aircraft resisting B-29 type aircraft groups. Finally, they also attacked the airfield near Chengdu, destroying 40 of them. The most noteworthy thing this time is the deployment of an organized interception battle. Under these circumstances, the US 20th Bombardment Squadron lost more than 90 aircraft after only two sorties. According to reports, the US Air Force has suffered heavy losses since the last air raid on the Japanese mainland until this bombing of Manchuria, so it will inevitably take a longer period of time to act again. Moreover, in view of the results of the Japanese army's battles in the previous two times, it can be seen that the losses of Chongqing-US aircraft in recent times have exceeded their replenishment capacity. This kind of slow warfare, bombing once every three or four weeks, contradicts the enemy's anxious strategy of a short-term decisive battle. It is expected that they will have to actively seek countermeasures. At the same time, under this slow bombing, the bombing effect they expected has been reduced to nothing due to the huge recovery power of highly industrialized countries. Now, B-29 type aircraft are trying to prolong their lives in secret bases in inland China and India, but this attempt has become a bubble because the Japanese aircraft's bombing of the Chengdu base group has achieved unprecedented success. It should be known that the United States has no other way to carry out air raids on Japan from mainland China except to use B-29 type aircraft. Therefore, it goes without saying that they will inevitably use this only means in the future. Moreover, because B-29 type aircraft waste a lot of gasoline, it does not help the air transport on the Chongqing-India Highway. Therefore, a smooth route from India to Chongqing is needed, but the Chongqing-US Air Force suffered heavy losses due to Japanese aircraft interception along the way.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front base, elite Japanese bombers attacked Danzhu, the Chongqing-US powerful offensive base, before dawn on the 12th. When they entered the airspace above the airfield, they dropped flares to confirm the target and then launched a fierce bombing attack on the protection area and the runway. Due to the night, the results of the battle could not be confirmed, but it is believed that it has been severely damaged. After completing the mission, all Japanese aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.</p>
<h3>Mayor of Guangzhou Takes Office</h3>

<h3>A Trip to Qingpu (II) Hua</h3>
<p>Discounted Rice Rent</p>
<p>The reporter followed North Gate Street directly north. I arrived at Xujia Sha and met with the local Baozhang, who said: "The system of tenants paying rice rent was changed to a discounted system two years after the incident. The discounted system is obviously a loss for the landlords, but it is the only good way to deal with the general stubborn tenants. After the incident, the tenants protested and refused to pay the rent, citing various difficulties in farming. Therefore, if there is a discount proposal, the method is divided into three deadlines. Those who pay the rent within the first deadline can enjoy a 10% discount based on the market price. Those who pay the rent within the second deadline will receive a 5% discount. Those who pay the rent within the third deadline must pay the full rent. If they still do not pay the rent after the third deadline, the landlord should take back the field next year and let them grow it themselves or let other tenants grow it instead. There is no objection. This system has been in place for several years and can still be at peace. As for the military rice, the portion that the landlord should apportion is all paid by the tenants. The landlord does not care about it at all because it has already been deducted from the rent receivable. Therefore, the landlord's treasure is ten times as busy with taxes and so on. Their net profit is less than 35%."</p>
<p>The Wind of Theft and Gambling</p>
<p>"There is one more thing that can be a cause for deep concern, and that is the wind of bandits. It is often heard. Fortunately, it has not yet spread here. Every time at night, the bandits smear their faces and foreheads, whistling and roaring, and enter the houses. They are not only very familiar with the path, but also the location of the property, often without asking. It can be known that they are acquaintances. But they come and go suddenly, enter and exit often, and act quickly. It is difficult to defend against them, which is indeed a cause for concern."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, I strolled to the county government. From the slogans on the wall next to the road, I could see that the History Magistrate here was just transferred to Qu River, but the one who got off the car first was County Magistrate Huang. Walking closer to the gate of the county government, I saw the first announcement, which was posted on August 31. The general idea is the routine matter of reorganizing the corrupt officials. The second is to reiterate the prohibition of gambling and similar gambling. From this, it is enough to imagine the general atmosphere of gambling in Qingpu.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Prices</p>
<p>The price of rice in Qingpu has risen from 7,000 yuan to 7,500 yuan in the past few days, while brown rice is only 5,000 to 5,500 yuan. There are no less than 30 rice mills, such as Baochang and Risheng. The sound of the rice mills is deafening. The rice in the rice shops everywhere is all purchased from the rice mills. The value of brown rice being milled into white rice, with one transfer, is so different. Its profit can be imagined. However, under the conditions that labor is expensive, firewood is also rising, and machine oil is even more expensive, the rice mills have their own words to justify it.</p>
<p>From the conversations of most people, it can be known that the people of Qingpu are mostly content with their hard work. For example, everyone knows that soap is a daily necessity, but most people in Huangpu do not use soap. Most of the fish and shrimp are sold to Shanghai, so the price in the local area is also raised a lot. Crucian carp, eel, and river shrimp cost about 160 yuan per city catty, while small fish cost about 120 yuan per catty. After the eel is cooked in the restaurant, each large pot of four sections sells for 360 yuan. Hearing this makes people gasp. As the saying goes, "People are poor, but the world is rich!" Is this what it means? (The End)</p>

The people of the county suffered greatly, and he hoped that the authorities would pay attention and gradually improve and adjust. At the same time, he hoped that the authorities would consider their treatment when establishing security work, so that they could afford to be honest. Finally, he hoped that the experimental county work would be promoted to benefit the people. After the county residents expressed their opinions, there was a five-minute break.

<h3>American Troops Reach Eupen, Advancing Towards German Territory</h3>
<p>German Special Forces Deployed to the Front Lines - Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - German News Agency reports: After the advance of the leading American tank units from Verviers (southeast of Liège) towards Limburg failed, the American command concentrated a larger force again on Monday and, after several hours of fierce fighting, finally forced the German defenders to retreat. The enemy advanced to the Eupen area (south of Aachen, located on the German border) and then advanced further east from there, but German tank detachments finally resisted the enemy's fierce attack east of the town. From the Aachen to Metz line, German troops entered the forward positions of the western defenses, with only local battles occurring in some strongholds, but there was fierce fighting in the Metz area. Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Germany has recently formed many new elite units and even formed special assault tank units, further increasing the power of the German army.

<h3>Soviet Army's Attack on Warsaw Reaches Climax</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - German News Agency reports: The battle for the Vistula River bridgehead east of Warsaw on Tuesday reached a new climax in its intensity. Although the enemy rushed into the bridgehead with powerful tank formations, the German counterattack forced the enemy to withdraw from its newly gained positions, except for a small penetration point.

<h3>Quebec Conference Begins to Discuss Pacific Strategy</h3>
<p>The German Problem is also a Focus of Discussion - Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to a Quebec dispatch: After completing their discussions on the morning of the 12th, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill convened a military meeting of the commanders of both countries in the afternoon. The content of the meeting was mostly about operational matters. Although the U.S. President's secretary and the British propaganda department meet with press groups daily, no definite reports have been released. Roosevelt and Churchill are conducting policy-level discussions on political and military strategies, with the military representatives of the two countries focusing on discussing specific strategies for the Pacific counter-offensive, especially how to allocate air force and fleet resources, and what the British military's mission should be, are all central topics. Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: According to U.S. sources: A spokesman for the Quebec Conference announced today that Roosevelt and Churchill convened their first meeting of staff officers today to discuss operational plans.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Selection</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: The New York Times quoted a dispatch from Quebec stating that well-informed sources in the area believe that the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Pacific Theater will belong to the current Commander of the U.S. Fleet, Admiral King, whose position will be the same as General Eisenhower's as Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe.</p>
<h3>Germany Will Fight and Not Yield</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: According to the speculation of various foreign newspapers known here, Roosevelt and Churchill intend to discuss the matter of demanding Germany's surrender at this Quebec Conference. The Anti-Axis powers may also imitate Wilson's Fourteen Points as bait to persuade surrender, but in any case, regardless of their promises, their demands are ultimately absurd and unreasonable. It should be known that the current state of mind of the German people is that they are unwilling to endure unconditional surrender. Every young and strong German has resolved to resist the enemy. German youths of seventeen years old are flocking to recruitment offices, and the people of the eastern provinces are participating in the construction of defensive works, which is proof of this spirit. Germany's current pursuit of a defensive war has two aspects: ○ Everyone knows that the Anti-Axis powers' current destruction of German cities shows that they will implement even harsher treatment than the Treaty of Versailles, ○ Germany can deploy new elite troops to fight. Government well-informed sources also said that the German army currently has millions of new troops on standby.</p>
<h3>The US Makes Demands to Chongqing</h3>

Guangdong, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to recent news arriving here: U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss met with Chiang Kai-shek on the 5th of this month, saying that he had received instructions from his country requesting the Chongqing army to deploy a large force of sixty divisions. However, Chiang first stated his extreme dissatisfaction with the slowness of U.S. aid to Chongqing, and further listed the fact that the U.S. military diverted aid to Chongqing for use by the U.S. troops stationed in India. The fall of Hengyang was also due to the slowness of aid to Chongqing, and he vehemently refuted the U.S. side's lack of credibility. As a result, the meeting between the two parties was fruitless, but Gauss may continue to make unreasonable demands to Chiang in the future.</p>
<h3>British and American Planes Deploy 2,000 Aircraft to Bomb German Territory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - While the Anti-Axis forces are attacking the Siegfried Line, they began bombing German territory on the 11th.

Following the U.S. bombing, British bomber squadrons bombed the northern and southern Rhine regions in the evening. Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - The German military authorities announced: At noon on the 11th, 113 U.S. aircraft were shot down in central Germany, 80 of which were four-engine heavy bombers.</p>

<h3>Returning From the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Department Stores Opening One After Another - Secondly, what has recently caused fluctuations in the lives of citizens in Moscow is the opening of department stores. Several have opened since June 26th. In essence, these are also commercial stores for daily clothing and fabrics. The largest department store, located in the central part of the capital, is a four-story building, about twice the size of the Matsuya in Ginza, Japan. The goods on display are no less than those of a major department store in Japan before the Greater East Asia War, with Western-style clothing, shoes, socks, watches, stationery, women's accessories, and kitchen supplies of all kinds. Although the quality is quite poor, the variety is quite rich. The number of commercial restaurants and food stores is comparable, and if you don't mind the high prices, you can buy anything without restriction except boots and Western-style clothing. Boots cost 1,000 yuan, women's silk stockings cost 100 to 200 yuan per pair, and watches (Swiss made) cost 3,000 yuan. Citizens line up outside the department stores from early morning. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union has opened stores where goods are rationed at low prices, while at the same time selling beautiful items of unbelievably high value without restriction. This kind of organization is beginning to become popular in various aspects. There are also many trains with dining cars on the Siberian Railway. The dining cars organized by the commercial wineries in Moscow are scheduled to connect with them starting from July 15th. It is probably already realized now. Furthermore, according to citizens' rumors, commercial barbershops and commercial bathhouses will also open soon. Needless to say, there are many barbershops in any city. A men's haircut costs only twelve or thirteen rubles, but no matter which barbershop you go to, you have to wait in line for a long time. The same is true for women's manicures; you wait in line for a long time and it's not your turn. Therefore, they came up with the so-called commercial barbershop, where you can get a haircut at any time without waiting in line by paying a special haircut fee of fifty to one hundred rubles. And it can be done very carefully. There are bathhouses open to the general public in the small streets throughout Moscow, and the lines are also very long. The commercial bathhouses that citizens are talking about are not only beautifully equipped and open at any time, but also have family bathhouses, as are commonly found in Japanese hot spring resorts. However, you have to pay a very high bathing fee; this is the truth about commercial bathhouses. Whether these barbershops and bathhouses have already opened, although the details are not known, in short, recently in the Soviet Union, this kind of commercial store is becoming popular in all aspects of citizens' lives, and this is a newly dropped pebble. The true meaning of so-called commercialism, in a nutshell, is that the methods by which Soviet citizens obtain the means of livelihood under wartime conditions, which were previously closed, differentiated, and partial, are now changing to open, undifferentiated, and equal. However, it is extremely difficult to realize this kind of transformation in one breath, so it is necessary to set particularly high prices, adding differences and restrictions that the people cannot see. The commercial restaurants, commercial wineries, department stores, etc. opened in the Russian capital currently seem to be limited to Moscow, but these can all be regarded as preparations for transitioning from a rationing system for clothing, food, and supplies to a free distribution system in open stores. By using the high prices mentioned above to absorb the purchasing power among the people and gradually reducing prices, the rationing system will eventually be stopped, and the system will change to free purchase in these open stores. Now, in Moscow's commercial food stores and commercial wineries, only two months after opening, prices have been reduced for the first time by approximately 15%. When leaving Moscow, according to citizens' rumors, starting from August 1st, all rations except for bread will be stopped, and instead, the free purchase system of commercial food stores will be used. Will it actually be implemented in this way? If so, then isn't the Soviet authorities starting to change the wartime economy to a peacetime economy in a part of the people's lives? This is a very interesting question. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 20th)</p>

<h3>The Rice Control Committee Prepares to Purchase New Grain, Plans to Use Sailboats to Transport Rice and Grain, and Formulates a Plan</h3>
<p>Since the summer and autumn of this year, the weather has been favorable, and the rice ears in the Yangtze River area of central China are in good condition. A bumper autumn harvest is expected. As the new grain is about to enter the market, the Rice and Grain Control Committee is promoting the purchase of rice and grain after this autumn. The committee is preparing various implementation tasks for the control and distribution of rice and grain in central China, such as establishing purchase areas, reviewing the qualifications of purchasing merchants, and adjusting rice and grain purchase prices. Concrete methods are being studied separately. It is reported that the research can be completely determined around the end of this month and the beginning of next month. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Rice and Grain Control Association, approving the use of sailboats to purchase rice and grain from Annam Saigon. The Standing Council of the Chamber of Commerce has resolved that the case will be handed over to the original proposer, Supervisor Chen Zhongnan, to prepare a plan and then submit it to the Rice and Grain Control Association for review.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Wu Answers Various Municipal Issues</h3>
<p>Nineteenth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday - The Municipal Propaganda Office held the nineteenth regular press conference at 10:00 AM yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building on Jiangxi Road. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Director Liang presided over the meeting and answered various municipal issues raised by reporters from various agencies. First, Director Liang gave a speech. Secretary-General Wu then gave a speech, stating: The regular press conference was suspended for a period during the summer, and today is the first regular conference to be held after the resumption. I am attending and participating, and I am very happy to meet everyone. Now, please raise your questions first, and then I will answer each question separately. After Secretary-General Wu finished speaking, reporters from various newspapers raised questions on the spot. The following is a summary of the questions and Secretary-General Wu's answers:</p>
<h3>Reports of Food Rationing Stopping are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>*China Daily* asked: It is rumored that household rice will be discontinued after two more distributions. Is this reliable? Answer: Household rice will not be discontinued, and the rumors are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Traffic Conditions are Quite Poor</h3>
<p>*Ping Bao* and the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: Recently, traffic conditions in the city have been quite poor. Several places where parking was previously prohibited are now permitted, affecting traffic. It is heard that the police near these places are also charging parking fees to those who park their vehicles. Police on the Sichuan Road Bridge are also doing the same to passing vehicles. How will the municipal government rectify this? Answer: The municipal government will establish a Traffic Improvement Committee, jointly organized by the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau and other relevant agencies. Various regulations have been drafted and will be promulgated soon. Through this kind of contact and reorganization, the various difficulties in the city's traffic can be gradually resolved.</p>
<h3>Garbage Piles Up Like Mountains in Nanshi</h3>
<p>*China Daily* asked: Garbage piles up like mountains in Nanshi, with a very bad smell. Why hasn't it been cleared? Answer: The garbage in Nanshi will be cleared by the Municipal Sanitation Bureau. Recently, due to the garbage collectors demanding a salary increase, which has not been resolved for the time being, the garbage has piled up again. The salary increase has now been resolved satisfactorily, and the Municipal Sanitation Bureau can step up the clearing.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Increasing Police Pay</h3>
<p>*China Daily* asked: After the unification of municipal administration in the city, the police pay will also be unified recently, and efforts will be made to increase salaries. Is this reliable? Answer: Regarding the issue of increasing police pay, the Advisory Committee has made a suggestion, and the municipal government has decided to consider increasing it. However, after increasing police pay, the monthly expenses will increase significantly, and it is necessary to start by reorganizing tax sources. The problem is not simple, and it is currently being carefully studied to achieve it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Small Fees Must Be Paid to Obtain Vehicle Licenses</h3>
<p>*Shen Bao* asked: Recently, various Chinese and foreign newspapers have reported on the news that black fees must be paid to obtain vehicle licenses. It is hoped that this will be prohibited. Answer: The Public Works Bureau has made every effort to investigate this matter and has dismissed more than 20 employees who were found to be cheating. It is hoped that the public will provide the bureau with facts in the future to assist the competent authorities in rectification.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Operate Past Closing Time</h3>
<p>*China Daily* and *New China* asked: Most entertainment venues in the city do not close at the specified time. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit this. Answer: The operating hours of entertainment venues are regulated to be until 10:00 PM. However, these venues still need half an hour of cleanup work after closing time. If this time is exceeded, it will naturally be strictly prohibited. It is heard that some entertainment venues, such as dance halls, continue to operate with other lights after the lights-out time, which is illegal and is being investigated and prohibited.</p>
<h3>Military and Police Rice Issues in Various Counties and Districts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: The prices collected for military rice in various counties and districts are quite uneven, and it is inevitable that fraud will occur. Does the municipal government have any improvement measures for the collection of military rice? Answer: The municipal government issued a circular to various district offices last winter to collect military rice, but due to many malpractices and little effect, the collection has now been ordered to be stopped. Subsequently, a Military and Police Rice Management Committee will be established in each county and district, jointly hosted by the local officials and gentry and the heads of military and police affairs. The military and police rice issues in each county and district are expected to be properly handled.</p>
<h3>Handling of Special Tax Fraud Cases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: What is the progress in handling the special tax office employee fraud case? Answer: The special tax fraud case involves a large number of people, about fifty or sixty. The person in charge of the police bureau has reported the results of the investigation to the mayor in writing. The mayor will then decide after reviewing it. It is found that the main reason for the occurrence of this kind of fraud is the unsound system of special tax collection. The Special Tax Section has now been changed to the Special Tax Office, which will be established on the 16th of this month. In the future, new methods will be used to promote work, so that merchants will not evade taxes, and strict reward and punishment rules will be formulated to encourage the staff to serve diligently. It is believed that after this reorganization, special tax revenue can be increased, and long-standing abuses can be eliminated. At this point, Secretary-General Wu retired first due to official business, and the reporters from various newspapers then raised opinions on holding regular press conferences in the future. It was decided that each bureau and office director would take turns reporting once a week, and the meeting adjourned at 11:30.</p>
<h3>Minister Miura of Manchukuo Discusses the Current Situation in Manchukuo</h3>
<p>All Construction Concentrates on Enhancing Combat Power - Minister Miura of Manchukuo to China, came to Shanghai on the 12th on official business. Yesterday, he had earnest talks with important figures from all walks of life in the city. In the afternoon, he also met with reporters to give a speech on the recent situation in Manchukuo and various issues between China and Manchukuo, as follows: Since the incident occurred, Manchukuo's construction has placed all non-wartime activities in a secondary position. For example, urban beautification and construction plans have been suspended. All construction is aimed at strengthening the heavy industry of combat power. The second five-year plan implemented this year also focuses on heavy industry and faster development. The US Air Force has attacked the Anshan area several times, which shows how afraid the enemy is of the increasing development of Manchukuo's industry. The harvest of agricultural products this year is expected to be even better than last year. This will also have a good impact on trade between China and Manchukuo. Regarding the relationship between China and Manchukuo, from my own wishes, the first is cultural exchange between the two countries. The relationship between China and Manchukuo lies in the same writing system and the same race, but in terms of culture, China should also be treated as an elder brother. Therefore, China's sound new culture must be continuously introduced to Manchukuo. This move will make a great contribution to the development of Manchukuo, and at the same time can strengthen the ligaments of the two peoples.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yuying Succeeds as Director of the Social Welfare Bureau</h3>
<p>Sun Ming, the director of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, has made considerable achievements in promoting social welfare in the city since taking office. Recently, he requested to resign from the municipal government due to physical weakness, which was approved. His vacancy has been filled by Zhou Yuying, a counselor of the municipal government. Zhou was originally the head of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp Preparatory Office and has always been respected by all sectors of society. After taking office, he will surely have new plans for the city's social welfare. It is learned that the Social Welfare Bureau is currently rushing to complete the handover, and will be able to take over and assume responsibilities within days. The municipal government has specially appointed Chen Qiushi, the director of the General Accounting Office, as the supervisor.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange and Insurance Bureau Under the Exclusive Control of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Regarding the jurisdiction of various insurance companies and stock exchanges, the Ministries of Finance and Industry have jointly discussed and formulated a division method. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Central Political Committee, and the National Government has ordered compliance: ○ All matters relating to company registration shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, ○ Insurance companies and stock exchanges related to finance, their registration supervision, and bans shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, ○ The Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervision Committee and the Insurance Supervision Bureau shall be placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. The Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to the two bureaus yesterday and learned that the two bureaus' internal departments have prepared to handle the transfer and closure matters. Once the preparations are completed and the government officially announces it, the handover will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>○ Recent News from Chengmin College of Arts and Commerce: Chengmin College of Arts and Commerce has enriched its curriculum this semester, and the class schedule is especially convenient for working young people to choose. It has recently been learned that the college, in response to requests from students from afar, has specially approved a supplementary entrance examination on September 17. No further accommodations will be made after the deadline. Old students and newly admitted freshmen are also required to register by the 19th.</p>

<h3>Preparing for This Season's Dominance: Tung Wah Football Club Expands Organization</h3>
<p>The Tung Wah Football Club of this city is the oldest Chinese football team. In the previous season, it won both the county-level Group A championship and the Mayor's Cup, reaching the peak of its popularity.

The internal organization has been adjusted and is now more rigorous than before. The board of directors has been increased to seventeen members, divided into three departments: general affairs, finance, and competition. There is also a secretariat established, which is further divided into general affairs, grounds, accounting, and team groups. Personnel for each department and group have been selected, and Ding Xuenuong has been publicly elected as chairman of the board. With this reorganization, the club's affairs will undoubtedly become more developed, and it is sure to put on an even better performance in this season's games.

<h3>Today's Softball Game: Hsiung Mao vs. Hsi Ching</h3>
<p>The softball league game between Hsiung Mao and Hsi Ching, originally scheduled for last Sunday, has been postponed due to rain to today (the 14th) at 5:00 PM for a make-up game at the Tung Wah Field. Yesterday's broadcast time was 6:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Approved Student Aid Recipients is This Saturday</h3>
<p>The list of students approved for this newspaper's scholarship fund was published in five installments on August 10th, 19th, 26th, 31st, and September 9th, with specified dates for collecting the funds. Most students have already collected their scholarships, but a few have not yet done so. With the exception of those whose family circumstances have been investigated and deemed satisfactory (and whose aid should be canceled), and those who have voluntarily declared their abandonment of the aid, all are requested to bring their registration certificates and their own or their parents' seals to the office to collect the funds no later than the 16th of this month (Saturday). Those who fail to collect the funds by the deadline will be deemed to have forfeited them.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Recipients Establish Fellowship</h3>
<p>This newspaper convened a symposium for scholarship recipients at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 9th of this month (details to be reported separately). During the symposium, students spontaneously initiated the organization of a fellowship to connect with each other, foster friendship, study academic subjects, encourage ethical conduct, and promote scholarship aid. With the unanimous support of all attendees, a preparatory committee was elected, which decided that each school with a larger number of recipients should nominate one representative, and the representatives would then elect five officers. Due to the inconvenience of electing the first group of representatives, the office will temporarily designate them. A meeting of representatives from each school will be convened this Sunday to discuss all matters. In the future, there will be more communication between students and between students and the office, which will greatly benefit the scholarship recipients and provide more convenience for the scholarship aid program.</p>
<h3>Generous Donations Received from All Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Chen Cunren, the organizer of the Hundred Branches Special Scholarship Fund, personally delivered 90,000 yuan in scholarship funds. Dr. Chen has always been enthusiastic about charitable endeavors and has been particularly supportive of this newspaper's scholarship program. He has organized the [Hundred Branches Scholarship Fund] for three sessions, generously donating significant funds. He provides scholarships to as many as 20 college students (15 approved this year), each subsidized until they graduate from college. Dr. Chen's enthusiasm for scholarship aid is deeply admirable. ○ Mr. Huang Shengyuan wrote in a letter: "Having learned that your newspaper has been providing scholarships to impoverished students over the years, benefiting many to a great extent, I am filled with admiration. I have specially raised 50,000 yuan in national currency from [Anonymous Donor]. Half of it will be transferred to the News Report Loan Scholarship, and the other half will be transferred to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Please acknowledge receipt." ○ Mr. Zhang Zhiming wrote in a letter: "This month's 10th day is my son Jin Fang's wedding day. I originally planned to prepare a celebratory banquet to entertain guests. However, in order to respond to the scholarship aid initiative, I have changed to serving tea and refreshments to the guests, saving the money. The savings are split and sent to the Shen and Xin newspaper offices as loan scholarships to benefit students and to further economize. I am now sending 20,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Please acknowledge receipt."</p>

<h3>(4) Characteristics of Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>The faculty and staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools seem to have built a deep moat and high walls, making it difficult for outsiders to [missing word]. Looking at the number of applicants registered in January 1943, whether middle or primary schools, all exceeded 2,000, but the actual number employed was less than one in ten. The reason is nothing more than the difficulty and rigor of selecting teachers, while the treatment is significantly better than that of general schools of the same level in the country. Therefore, many seek it, but few are employed. The various characteristics are described as follows: Difficulty in Employing Personnel</p>
<p>I. Procedures for Employment The Education Department and each school have teacher and staff application registration forms. Applicants can go directly to obtain them without any fees. After filling out the registration form, together with credentials (or copies), and photographs, it is submitted to the desired school. The principal then screens them according to needs, and those deemed qualified are then recommended to the Director of Education. However, the recommendation is not just a letter; the applicant must be introduced to the Director of Education for a brief conversation. If the Director of Education agrees, the following procedures must be completed before being hired as a probationary teacher. A. The Director of Education sends a letter to the Health Department for a free physical examination. This examination is very serious. In addition to X-rays or fluoroscopy of the internal organs, the Deputy Director of the Health Department personally examines the applicant, including chemical tests of saliva and urine. Probationary employment is not permitted without a satisfactory report from the Health Department. B. The Director of Education reports the applicant's qualifications and experience to the General Office, along with the credentials, requesting a review. If the General Office finds any problems, probationary employment is not permitted. The above two points are by no means mere formalities. It is generally believed that once a teacher is approved for employment by the Director of Education or the principal, there are no problems. However, in Chinese schools, employment is often not permitted due to physical or qualification issues, regardless of circumstances. The probationary period is generally three months, with salary paid accordingly. The principal naturally pays special attention to guidance work during the probationary period. However, according to Chinese custom, teachers should be automatically hired by the school authorities or administrative authorities to teach. If all talent is sought through registration applications, whether the scope is too narrow is a question that should be noted. II. Regulations for Employing Teachers Teacher grades in Chinese schools of the Shanghai Municipal Council are divided into four grades for middle schools and three grades for primary schools. Those who graduated from European and American universities, obtained degrees, and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 1. Those who graduated from domestic universities, obtained degrees, and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 2. Those who graduated from vocational schools or advanced normal schools and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 3. Those who graduated from the school and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 4. For primary schools they are split into three groups: those who graduated from domestic or foreign university colleges of education or education departments, obtained degrees, and have more than three years of teaching experience, and have significant works are ranked grade 1, university graduates who have earned a degree, and have teaching experience are ranked grade 2, vocational schools, advanced normal schools, or senior high normal schools, who have teaching experience are rank grade 3. This kind of qualification restriction is extremely strict, with no exceptions, no leniency, and no one dare to attempt requests for cross-leveling. Some years ago, the Chinese Education Department established a method for hiring primary school teachers as a guiding principle. The regulations regarding the qualifications and educational experience of hired teachers are listed as follows (referring to teachers below Grade 2): A. Applicants must be graduates of senior high normal schools or old-style normal schools, or university graduates with teacher training. B. Applicants must have at least one year of primary school teaching experience. C. Applicants must be between the ages of 24 and 40. D. Applicants must be proficient in Mandarin Chinese. In practice, when a primary school principal position becomes vacant, it is always filled by the director of teaching resources (i.e., a Grade 1 teacher). When the director of teaching resources position becomes vacant, it is filled by a superior teacher who meets the qualifications. From the above points, it can be seen that the employment procedures for faculty and staff of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools were troublesome, and the selection process was strict and cautious.

<h3>Striving for Final Victory in the Fiercest Battles</h3>
<p>Statement by Minister Izubuchi At the regular press conference hosted by the Army Press Department of the Allied Japanese forces in Shanghai yesterday (13th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road, Chinese journalists from this city were received. Minister Izubuchi personally attended the meeting with Mr. Akahoshi, entrusted with the meeting, and immediately clarified the current state of the Great East Asia War and the enemy's state of defeat, anxiety, and panic in detail. Finally, he said that the final victory should be strived for in the fiercest battles, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final five minutes. The content of Minister Izubuchi's speech is divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Anti-Morning Song: Enemy Anxious and Uneasy</h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi first stated that regarding the current situation of the Great East Asia War, the Army and Navy Ministers reported on the war situation in detail at the recent Imperial Extraordinary Diet session. In certain sectors, the Japanese army has achieved considerable success and results, but from a broader perspective, further efforts are still needed to overcome the remaining difficulties, especially in the Pacific region. The enemy American Air Force has launched large-scale air raids on the southern and central Philippines since the 9th of this month. This is clearly because American President Roosevelt is attempting to win reelection and is engaging in these blind bombings to achieve meager results, and his plan is to launch an aggressive counterattack against Japan in a dream to win back popular support. The intention of this move is nothing more than a military and domestic political ploy, so such measures are not worth noting. At the same time, Roosevelt and Churchill recently held another meeting in Quebec, and the enemy has continuously promoted the discussion of concrete plans for counterattacks against Japan as a cover. The so-called reflection of their counterattacks is becoming increasingly anxious and helpless, further exposing the weakness of defeat. Therefore, we must clearly recognize this situation. Regarding the decisive battle situation between the two sides, it is becoming increasingly favorable to Japan. Navy Minister Yonai revealed in the Diet that he deeply believes that he already has all the definite winning strategies for future operations. This is a golden and valuable piece of advice at this decisive stage, and its meaning is very profound. It clearly portrays the situation as being advantageous to Japan and reflects the enemy's anxiety and uneasiness.</p>
<h3>Mainland Operations Very Smooth</h3>
<p>There is another point that may make the enemy feel frightened and threatened, that is, the war situation on the Chinese mainland battlefield. Some people feel that the end of the mainland war situation is enough to determine the trend of the Great East Asia War. The advantageous situation on the mainland front has been that since the Japanese army captured Hengyang, it has been advancing westward along the Xiang-Gui Railway, and the journey has been very smooth, fully demonstrating the power of the Japanese army. From the night of the 6th of this month to the morning of the 7th, it successively captured the enemy American's forward base for the Chongqing Air Force, Lingling Base and the city streets. At the same time, it continued to advance fiercely along the highway. Finally, on the 9th, the elite troops of the Japanese army broke into the territory of Guangxi Province and advanced into Guizhou Province. Therefore, in terms of the mainland battlefield, Japan's advance from the central China region of Hunan to the southwest region of China is the first time since the incident that such a high speed has been seen. The active advancement on the mainland battlefield has had a major impact on Chongqing. At the same time, the impact on the anti-Axis side and the American Air Force in Chongqing is enormous. Their situation is so embarrassing that it cannot be described. Enemy American public opinion alone is filled with panic and unease over the Japanese army's threat to Guilin, which is only about a hundred miles away on the highway, further showing their fear. On the other hand, the Shanghai Japanese army began operations in eastern Zhejiang. Starting from Jinhua, they first occupied Lishui, the base of the enemy American Air Force in Chongqing, and continued to advance eastward along the Ou River. They completely occupied Wenzhou on the morning of the 9th of this month. The Japanese headquarters officially announced it at 4:00 PM on the 11th. The loss of Wenzhou to Chongqing has had a very significant impact and blow to the Third War Zone in Chongqing. British and American journalists stationed in Chongqing attach great importance to the Japanese army's entry into Guizhou Province and predict that the Japanese army will drive straight into Yunnan and Guizhou. Every foreign journalist is writing communications to stimulate public opinion in their own countries. When we look at the gradual loss of air force bases by the American Air Force in Chongqing, their future actions and air combat power will suffer a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Defense Exerts Power</h3>
<p>The enemy American Air Force is wielding its so-called excellent weapon, relying wholeheartedly on the B-29 Superfortress bomber's flight rate, and intends to be able to attack the Japanese mainland and Manchuria. However, the character of the B-29 is not as good as they imagine and is not worth considering. When it last attacked northern Kyushu, the power and results of the Japanese air defense forces were visible. At the same time, the enemy American Air Force attacked Manchuria again, and on the way back, it was attacked by the Japanese Air Force and suffered many losses. It was simply unbearable to attack. Subsequently, the Japanese Air Force attacked Chengdu that evening in the dark night and achieved great results. Therefore, they cannot fully exert their effectiveness. Thus, the weaknesses of this so-called elite fighter plane, which the enemy boasted about, are fully exposed under the fierce attack of the Japanese army. Their forward bases are being lost everywhere, and their anxiety and uneasiness have exceeded our expectations.</p>
<h3>Firmly Believe in Final Victory</h3>
<p>According to Chongqing telegrams, the commander of the Chongqing army defending Lishui died in battle. Two battalion commanders were detained and interrogated due to the Chongqing government's anger. The responsibility for the loss of Lishui was finally judged by a military court in Yonghe on the 6th of this month, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad that day. Therefore, the Chongqing government feels deeply uneasy about the Japanese army's attack. In short, the Great East Asia War is unfolding more fierce decisive battles every day, whether on the Chinese mainland battlefield or the Pacific battlefield. It goes without saying that the situation will become more tense. Therefore, the final victory must be strived for in the fiercest battles, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final five minutes. Furthermore, the enemy's ideological warfare, with British and American boasting and propaganda, is most active in this era. If the belief in final victory is slightly shaken, it will truly give the enemy an excellent opportunity. The trend of the current war situation is naturally quite obvious. At the end of the speech, the minister recalled the disastrous defeat of the British at Dunkirk in the summer of 1940. Even after the defeat, the British people continued to firmly believe in victory. Such a strong attitude of the British people, although a belief of the enemy, is still worthy of our imitation.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Thoughts on Customs Organization</h3>
<p>— Wang Mai</p>
<p>The current customs organization is still trapped in the all-British style enemy system from the early days of customs creation and has not been reformed. Its biggest drawback is the deliberate division into internal and external departments, unlike that of the allied Japanese, where internal and external operations are not divided and work is mutually connected. The current customs authorities can greatly emulate the organization of the Shanghai Police Bureau, that is, field personnel can be transferred to the bureau to serve at any time, and bureau personnel should also be sent out to work at any time. Active personnel, whether internal or external, should all wear uniforms to emphasize dignity and enhance self-esteem and a sense of responsibility. Currently, a senior customs officer at a customs office receives a monthly salary of 230,000 yuan, and the work they do is just copying a ship number on a customs declaration, and sometimes they do this completely unimportant work for three or four consecutive years. In fact, this kind of simple work can be done by a large number of low-level female employees who are paid more than 10,000 yuan a month. On the one hand, senior personnel who are paid huge salaries can be used at any time. The division between internal and external operations should be abolished immediately, and the most important duties such as supervision and inspection, which are most relevant to customs revenue, should be taken on. The most important work must be done by senior personnel who are paid huge salaries, which is more appropriate. Because senior personnel who are paid huge salaries have been in service for ten or twenty years, have savings, pension interests, and most have family concerns, engaging in wrongdoing and cheating is less likely than the current most field personnel who are around 20 years old and have just come from middle school. Also, according to the current system, field inspectors do inspection work anytime and anywhere. Unscrupulous transportation and customs declaration merchants can easily collude with these people, protect smuggling, evade customs duties, and undermine control. Therefore, the only effective way is to emulate Japan, abolish the internal and external hierarchical system, and have the customs director personally assign the service locations of each customs officer every day, and be diligent in transfers, so that evils such as prior contact and illegal goods can be reduced or avoided. Moreover, after the elimination of the internal and external boundaries, the inspection lineup will be strengthened after the current lightly worked and leisurely internal senior personnel go out to work. Once there are many eyes and ears, a small number of wrongdoers may know to restrain themselves a little!</p>
<h3>Questioning Legal Issues</h3>
<p>— Wei Yi</p>
<p>I work at the Jingzu Office in the Zhongzhi Building on Yandang Road. This office and the Dongya Sports College are involved in a lawsuit over eviction. Previously, the Shanghai District Court made a final judgment and issued an enforcement order to force the debtor, Dongya Sports College, and the de facto occupier, Dongya Middle School, to move out of the house. The court bailiffs and police, as well as the chief of the Baojia district and the persons to be executed, went to the scene to carry out the eviction, and the case was concluded after they pledged to take back the disputed house. Subsequently, on September 8, Dongya Middle School, together with court bailiffs, presented an order issued by the president of the court and a notice from the court clerk, instructing them to temporarily restore the original state of the previously executed house because of a statement from the person to be executed, and then to review the case. According to Article 12, Paragraph 1 of the current Compulsory Enforcement Law, after the conclusion of an enforcement case, no objection may be raised, and the enforcement court need not issue any further orders or dispositions. Now, the Shanghai District Court has issued an order to restore the original state of an executed case, but I don't know what the basis is. Wei Yi is a small civilian with limited knowledge, and I dare not resist at the time, but I don't know what to do afterward. However, because the foregoing incident has created an unprecedented precedent in the judicial world, and because it is a matter of personal interest, and Shanghai is a gathering place for legal experts, I dare to send a letter to your newspaper requesting publication and soliciting opinions. I hope that contemporary legal giants will send a letter of instruction so that I can follow it. I am extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Layman Zhou Jingxi Purchases Bao Fu Fa to Gift to Relatives and Friends</h3>
<p>Layman Zhou Jingxi of Qianchang Paper Shop obtained and read [Bao Fu Fa] written by Mr. Nie Yuntai, which was sold at this office. The book lists how a certain person prospered through accumulating good deeds, how a certain person perished through accumulating bad deeds, and how a certain person's fullness without overflowing allowed him to maintain his wealth for a long time, and how a certain person thought that wealth was unkind, and it entered and exited perversely. He sighed and said, "Cause and effect are clear, and the mirror is not far away. There is nothing more relevant to encouraging good and punishing evil than this." Therefore, he considered the intentions of his relatives and friends and purchased 2,000 copies from this office, worth 20,000 yuan, to distribute to his relatives and friends in order to spread it widely. This is indeed beneficial to promoting morality. This office organizes six social undertakings: ○ Poverty Relief Fund, ○ Orphan Aid Fund, ○ Medical Aid Fund, ○ Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers, ○ Maternity Aid Fund for Poor Women, ○ Small Loan Fund, all of which aim to rescue the poor and sick and to show compassion for the lonely and destitute. If generous donations are received, accumulating wealth with kindness is also the best opportunity for wealthy families to distribute wealth.</p>
<h3>Sending Medical Expenses to Injured Self-Defense Volunteers</h3>
<p>Recently, a robbery occurred in the 17th Baojia District of Dongninghai Road. Three self-defense volunteers, Song Linzi, Ye Changming, and Lu Zhongyuan, were injured when they stepped forward to encircle and arrest the robbers, who swung their knives and stabbed them indiscriminately. Mr. Pan Jiyan of Dayuan Commercial Savings Bank specially sent a check for 3,000 yuan in national currency, instructing this newspaper to forward it to the injured volunteers as medical expenses. Yesterday, this office instructed someone to send it to the 17th Baojia Office to be forwarded. Mr. Pan's enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable.</p>

<h3>Thunderstorm (3)</h3>
<p>For several days, it was like a dream. Around the morning of the eighth, when Ryufu heard the imperial rescript declaring war, his heart and nose tingled, and his eyes filled with tears. Soon after, the great victories of the attack on Pearl Harbor were partially announced. He was so excited he couldn't sit still on his chair.</p>
<p>(Just as I imagined. If Shinji were suited for aviation, he would probably have joined the war already.) Ryufu felt sorry for Shinji.</p>
<p>As he thought this, the figure of Lieutenant Colonel Tobita suddenly appeared in his room.</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations!" Ryufu stood up and celebrated the great victory.</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations! But there's something to congratulate you on as well." A smile appeared on the Lieutenant Colonel's pale face.</p>
<p>"For me?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Because you have work to do. The section chief wants you to draw a picture of the Pearl Harbor attack to be published in magazines and newspapers."</p>
<p>Ryufu suddenly couldn't speak and just stared at the Lieutenant Colonel's face.</p>
<p>"It's your first job. Do it well! But it must be submitted by six o'clock this afternoon!" Then the Lieutenant Colonel's figure disappeared outside the door.</p>
<p>(Great, the opportunity has arrived!) Ryufu's body trembled, and he began preparing, determined to make every moment count. Since it was a copperplate engraving for newspapers, only black and white were needed, but as a commissioned artist for the press section, it was unacceptable to make mistakes in drawing matters of the Imperial Court. He smoothed out the drawing paper and carefully reviewed the album of warship types again to avoid any past errors. Then, he thoroughly examined the photographs of the Imperial Navy's torpedo bombers and dive bombers taken from various angles. Then he made a design on another sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to being too impatient, but the drawing paper had slight unevenness in places. But since time was already pressing, he ignored it and started drawing. He began with a pencil sketch. It was a fierce attack diagram of naval aircraft looking down from the high mountains of Pearl Harbor. The water columns kicked up by the bombs, the enemy ships tilting after being hit, and the swooping and circling Japanese aircraft were all vividly drawn on the paper.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes before the designated time, Ryufu's first job was completed.</p>
<p>(Damn it, it looks terrible!) Ryufu looked at his own drawing and thought, hitting his head. (141)</p>
<h3>The Process of Establishing the Agricultural College at St. John's University</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fertilizer Industry Association was established in the spring of last year. Its members were mostly former managers of foreign firms such as Asiatic Petroleum, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Arliss &amp; Mallon in various counties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The chairman of the board is Mr. Zhou Qing'en, and the directors include Mr. Qian Desan, Yang Chunhua, Hu Xiangyao, Weng Zhifei, Yan Pengfei, and others. Because the members of the association manage the fertilizer industry, they have great hopes and sincerity for the improvement of agriculture in China. They all believe that it is urgently necessary to cultivate a generation of highly knowledgeable scientific personnel so that they can serve the agricultural sector after the war situation is settled. Therefore, they consulted with Mr. Xu Zhengkeng, the association's advisor, to raise funds to establish an agricultural university. They also received support from social celebrities such as Xiang Kangyuan, Shen Siliang, Chen Binhe, and the late Mr. Zhang Yipeng, as well as the cooperation of experts such as Wang Qihua, Zhang Weiru, and Zhao Wu. However, the funds raised were only five million yuan. It would be difficult to fully equip an independent agricultural university with the necessary scientific research equipment. Therefore, they contacted St. John's University, requesting to donate funds to add agricultural experimental facilities that were known to be perfect. If these facilities could be used, the donation of funds for the initial agricultural equipment would be sufficient. After careful consideration by the university's board of directors, they fully understood the great intentions of the gentlemen of the Fertilizer Industry Association and accepted this suggestion. Preparations are currently underway, and the formal opening of the school is approaching.</p>
<h3>The Organization of the Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association</h3>
<p>The gentlemen of the Fertilizer Industry Association also believe that the current donation is only the initial step in establishing the school, and further fundraising efforts are still needed. Therefore, they have formed the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association as a support organization. However, educational undertakings require vast amounts of funding. Since St. John's University has added an agricultural college, its expenses will also increase greatly. The limited donations from the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association will not be able to adequately cover the costs. It is still hoped that philanthropists in society will join in this grand undertaking, whether it be providing books and equipment or land for agricultural and animal husbandry experiments, whether in the form of funds or in-kind donations. The college's agricultural and animal husbandry fields are temporarily using the school's athletic field, which is not a long-term solution and urgently needs to be replaced. It is unknown whether anyone has heard of this and will offer assistance. The gentlemen of the Shanghai Fertilizer Industry Association have such a sincere desire to promote education, and they have established the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association and obtained the approval of St. John's University to realize their goal. It seems necessary to briefly record the origins of this event to commemorate it and supplement historical records.</p>
