<h3 id="c1">緊急關頭 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>一億國民決心，千萬人不足懼</p>
<p>日本新聞界元老，每日新聞社社賓德富蘇峯先生，道德文章，為世所重。近在塞班島戰役守土軍民壯烈殉職以後，以「緊急關頭」為題，向日本國民廣播，激昂淬厲之情，溢於言表，不但日本國民聞之奮發，亦可供吾人所借鏡。爰即迻譯轉載如次：</p>
<p>一億同胞們，塞班島全軍犧牲，誠屬一大憾事！此次決不能與阿圖島全軍覆沒的情形，相提無論，這一點大本營業已發表，自然諸位已經洞若觀火，用不着我在作辭費。只有一點，立刻毛髪悚立，義憤填胸，恨不能食敵之肉疲寢敵之皮。同時對於陸海軍陣亡將士，以及非戰鬥員的塞班島同胞，那樣不愧鬚眉地有效發揮了日本人的本色，眞令人摩頂禮拜，五體投地。我所以特別提出非戰鬥員者，就是他們雖有延殘喘繼續生存的機會，但為了天皇陛下，仍然隨同將士，從容就義。這一點，我相信將永垂史冊，替皇國威信放一異彩。</p>
<p>但我們從自悲傷旣往，痛恨敵人，是於事無補的。問題仍不能算是過去。而我們的戰鬥員及非戰鬥員，對於我們現在及將來的敎訓，應當加以如何地學習，如何地利用，不要抱着死者死矣的精神，而要在將來的戰局中，發揮光大他們英勇的精神。我認為這是最重要緊的。現在不是徒托空言，哀不欲生，自暴自充的時候。而要達觀戰爭大局，努力爭取勝利。假如我們此時不走錯一步，善自應付荊棘叢生的局面，繼承前此殉國烈士的遺志，則我們取得最後勝利，這是無容置疑的。同時，這也是我敢以人格作担保，向大家斷言的。</p>
<p>此次，敵軍是破釜沉舟，孤注一擲的戰。法是傾全國之力來犯的。他們想一氣呵成地擊潰日本。這是因為對於他們，長期戰是極端不利的。至於為什麼長期對於他們是不利的，這一點無需我來詳細解釋，因為篇幅有限，總結一句話說，就是由於國內問題。</p>
<p>換言之，長久戰爭下云，他們國內就有土崩瓦解的危險，因為內部都各自為政。第二就是國外問題。他們好像是二人三足賽跑一樣，彼此間有言語難以形容的勾心鬥角關係。這樣一種同盟關係，如果持久下云，自然就會慢慢地鬆馳的。他們只相信物質是萬能的，想以絕對優勢的物質，一下擊潰日本。他們認為一下擊中，日本就會崩潰的，如是內部戰綫就可平安無事，而外部戰綫也傾此可以消滅。就是因為這個理由，他們在藉全國之師來犯的。縱令如此，事實也不會像他們所想像的那樣如意，日本一擊即亡。而無論什麼時候，日本將與他們周旋到底，一直等到他們盤疲力竭，計究策之為止。</p>
<p>由此觀之，在這個時期我們就當作什麼呢？就是要停止短期戰，而要用持久戰來糾纏他們，所謂他們，實際上就是美國。怎樣來糾纏他們呢？就是只要日本不失敗，自然這就是一年的長期戰。如果百年不完，這就是百年的長期戰。因此我們要乘此機會，忍苦耐勞，發揮大日本帝國的臣民精神，以三各年來的日本傳統彈力，即每逢一雖則增百倍的勇氣，應付任何當前大敵，我們始終一心一德，從不氣餒，奮鬥到底，於是彼方則自然氣衰的。</p>
<p>大家都曉得，敵軍逐漸向我們日軍迫近，就是說，他們愈離他們自己的本國遠了。而我們則愈離本國近了。由東京至塞班島的距離，和由華盛頓至塞班島的距離，縱我講不出來，但大家也會知道的。是我們一伸手即可碰到的地方，但對於敵人說，是必須爬山過海，萬里懸軍的。所以我們看到敵人愈益迫近，就無須特別懼怕，也無須效杞人之憂。</p>
<p>換一個方式來說，就是敵人愈益迫近我們大砲的彈道了。就是敵人愈益走近死地了。敵人即將給我們日本送命來的。因此我們在這個時期，必須利用這個機會，否則利用無日矣。</p>
<p>因此，我認為此時有兩個方法，第一，就是古代羅馬人對待加太基人所採取的方法。今日的英美，就是古時的加太基人。加太基人的統帥漢尼拔之類的人物，渡地中海設根據地於西班牙，由西班牙迂迴而越亞爾裴斯山，竟一直衝向意大利的廣袤平原。但當時羅馬的士卒，與其說百戰百勝，倒勿寗說百戰百敗，尤其干內之戰，羅馬人敗得更為可憐。因此，意大利的全部十分之七八領土，都成為淪陷區，自由區不過是羅馬城及其附近而已。</p>
<p>但古代羅馬人是有骨氣的。古代羅馬人的精神是堅强的。古代羅馬人對於本國的命運，是有信心的。其勝利信心，是虔誠而篤厚的。且有發比斯將軍，常以寡困眾，於是漢尼拔將軍雖然勝過不少次，但也無如之保·一年一年地過去了，軍事機構發生鬆懈，兵士逐漸倦怠，縱然將帥仍有不可一世的英氣，但武器業已靡不振起來，攻勢固然不斷發動，但他們想取得決定性的戰果也不可能。在這個時候，羅馬兵渡海以攻加太基本國，於是漢尼拔無法，只好自動放棄包圍，而倉皇逃歸，終於不久加泰基竟自崩潰了。</p>
<p>羅馬人是什么人呢？難道說羅馬人所能者，我們具有三千年候鳥歷史的大日本帝國就中可能麼？由此看來，我們日本人無論是英美人如何大折磨，是毫無理由氣餒的。因此，我們要乘此機會，加强一億同胞的緊張性，同時更要加强戰時體制，此處所說的戰時體制，並非專指什麼法庭或規章，而是心理的戰時體制，就是說，今後必須認識這是艱苦的戰爭。關於這一點，固然軍事當局和政府官吏各有其決心，但今日我願特別提出者，即每遇事發生，不要因法不備，而就大家表示出傍若觀火的樣子來。使法生者，是人。使法死者也是人。無法的時代，創法者也是人。至於人是什麼，這一點，實際上這就是人的心。只要有精神，有誠意，有氣魄，則「千萬人吾往矣」。今日縱令美國人和英人國源源而來，但我們敢約對相信，決不會有我們一億同胞這樣龐大的數目。如是，我們還有什麼可怕的呢？還有什麼担心的呢？</p>
<p>唯今日應當注意者，並非古代的羅馬人，而是現在的意大利人，因為他們受到英美人宣傳的誘惑，而構成奇恥大辱。無論盎格魯撒克遜人怎樣花言巧語來誘惑我們，但我們要知道，他們是欺騙成性的賊盜，他們是海盜，是山賊，是無所不為的歹徒。如一信任他們，則中其計謀。</p>
<p>戰鬥並非單純兵與兵的戰爭，最重要的戰鬥凡是粉碎敵陰謀。敵人對於我們，一方面希翼一氣呵成地鎮服日本，另一方面則用花言巧語來籠絡我們。粉碎這類陰謀，就是最重要的課題之一。但粉碎這種陰謀的根本方針，就是我們努力奉行宣戰大詔，一直完成宣戰大詔所指示的目標，以期擊潰敵人。只要有這種決心，我們是任何人都不怕的，任何事都不足担心的。我們所怕都和所担心者，是被敵人策謀所乘這件事，所以希望大家加以高度的注意。（魯譯自七月二十一日每日新聞）</p>

<p>宜傳部林部長爲酬答國新關事業，及慰勉我國盟邦在滬報道當局協助我在滬新聞界同人起見，特於昨（五）日中午假華懋飯店九樓，設宴招待，林部長準時出席招待，來賓方面到有宣次章克，中央電訊社社長郭秀峯，副社長胡瀛洲，報業經理處主任伍麟趾，市宣傳處長梁秀予，新聞檢查所主任劉石克，電影檢查委員會主任鍾有材，中華日報許力求，顏加保，梁式，楊迴浪，申報陳彬龢，新聞報鄭鴻彥，平報金雄白，陸光杰，新中國報翁氷淸，國民新聞黃敬齋，朱　康，新申報日高，大陸新報尾坂曁森山，及盟邦上海陸軍報道部出淵部長，赤星囑託，駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，鹽由大尉，日大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，福間副領事等七十餘人。　　林宣部長致詞</p>
<p>席間首由林部長致辭，略謂：「盟邦報道機關各位先生，上海新聞界各位，兄弟此次來滬爲酬答盟邦各報道當局，及日本新聞界各位，對中國新聞事業協助，及希望本國新聞界各位更形努力起見，特治菲筵，承各位冒暑光臨，茲趁此機會，向各位報吿一點。今晨中國新聞協會舉行籌務會議，成績非常滿意，成立中國新聞協會之理由，因鑒於目前大東亞戰爭已入決戰階段，所有政治·經濟·文化·宣傳各方，莫不加緊努力，我們想起盟邦前綫將土，爲保衛本國，保衛大東亞圈內各盟國而奮勇作戰，我們在後方的，特別是文化宣傳的，應該舉起我們的筆桿，爲大東亞戰爭而努力，兄弟根據這點之意思，希望盟邦各機關及新聞界，能繼續不斷的來幫助我們，同時本國新聞界各位先生更能繼續不斷的努力，祝中日兩方新聞界更能表示合作精神，集中兩國的筆桿努力，同時祝大東亞戰爭勝利」云云。</p>
<p>松島部長致詞</p>
<p>繼由松島報道部長致詞謂：「際此戰局日趨嚴重之階段，但離我們的理想尙遠，我們站在文化宣傳之前哨，益覺使命之重大，即以上海而言，仍有英美殘餘勢力存在，我們在此局國之下，應如何勞力達成使命，中國新聞協會，在此時誕生成立後，能多多努力，達成使命，這是我們所深切希望的，我們尤其希望林部長閣下，隨時能懇切指導我們，為爭取大東亞戰爭勝利而努力，我們在此誠心敬祝林部長閣下，今後更能努力，更加奮鬥。」</p>
<p>本報陳社長詞</p>
<p>本報陳社長致詞略謂：「剛才林部長與松島部長均言時局嚴重，與新聞界之責任重大，而勗勉新聞界同人加倍努力。可是上海是一謠言的都市，時局越嚴重，謠言越多。前幾天股票狂漲，可見上海謠言的力量，兄弟時時深思爲什麼謠言會發生這樣大的力量，謠言會發生力量，就是我們正規宣傳的失敗。今後我們的對策，兄弟以爲有二方面，第一，新聞界本身宣傳技術之改進。第二，我們期待整個政治要求進步。無論中央或地方政治，必須進步，我們才有資料可以宣傳，還有一點請求林部長的，林部長此次來滬與我們新聞界會見，希望更能與上海各界的領袖多多聯絡，因爲目前一般上海的各界領袖，都幾乎不信任報紙上發表的新聞，希望部長以後將實際情形吿訴他們，使他們明瞭。這建議是有根據的，即上次關於太平洋戰局，海軍方面會召開座談會結果得到很大效果。同時，我們希望盟邦陸軍報道當局，對中國大陸作戰情形，和大使館情報部對日本內閣之改組等，與各方交換意見。時局固然嚴重，我們就應使社會各界領袖瞭解時局之嚴重性，僅賴報紙的宣傳是不够的，剛才松島部長希望我們中國新聞協會多多努力，我希望能發揮自治精神，發揚光大以報答林部長，及盟邦報道當局之期待」云云。席間暢談情極歡洽，至二時餘盡歡而散。</p>

<h3 id="c18">滬西漚　保甲工作改進　接收後工作效率增進 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>查滬西保甲事務，原歸本巿巿政府保甲委員會滬西區辦事處辦理。自去歲滬西警察局合併於第一警察局後，該地區之保甲，亦遂漸統一，均由第一警察局所管轄。保甲處於去年十一月問向巿府保甲委員會接收，即成立保甲處西區辦事處，主任一職，由顧處長親自兼任外，副主任派范一案充任，督導該區域華山長寗兩分局工作，該區原有保甲，在創辦之初，各聯保之劃分，及人選標準，多因臨時制宜，不免略有牽强。</p>
<p>重行劃分聯保</p>
<p>迨劃歸第一警察局保甲處接管後，經顧處長范副主任悉心舉劃，縝密考慮，根據各地區域實際情形，繪製圖表，將原有第一二三坊，重行劃分爲華山保甲區爲八個聯保，長寗保甲區爲七個聯保，並組織華山長寗兩保甲區保甲聯合委員會，聘請沈嗣良，張德欽，馮炳南，戴　慮，張佩紳等爲委員，樂鳳麟爲華山總聯保長，周夢白爲長寗總聯保長，各聯保長及保長人選，亦均經遴選工廠經理或商舖經理，提高地位，分別委定。自此人事調整以後，對於保甲經費，除遵照市府規定征收之外，絕對不准浮濫多收，重行淸查戶　，以掃除過去浮報之弊</p>
<p>換發新已有住證</p>
<p>同時管轄之華山長寗兩警察分局，關於各該管區域內換發新居住證事宜，經兩分局積極準備，中區方面自四月一日開始，西區在戶口重查，保甲重編，各項手續重行調整之下，至四月十日亦開始辦理，蓋捺指紋，換領新證，爲便利市民起見，特於每一市民　　指紋，需要若干時間，每日共能辦理若干，作精密統計，然後依照各聯保各保次序，順次進行，規定日期，分別通知，以免市民鵠候擠軋之苦，新居住證經憲兵隊騐印後，即規定日期，通知各保長，使每戶派一代表前往換領，絕無故意留難及再收任何費用。遇有年高身弱及婦人有孕者，曁機關學校工廠社團，因有職務上之阻碍，得請求派警前往各該處所，捺蓋指紋，換領新證。至於市民如在規定日期，因事不能前往辦理者，可在星期日上午到局補捺及換領。現在華山保甲區每日蓋捺指紋及換發新證，平均約一千二百餘八。長寗保甲區每日蓋捺指紋者約一千人，換發新證者約五百人。九月內即可全部竣事。其辦理換發新證人數不下於中區，或恐尙有過其數也。對於蓋捺指紋，一般市民，初固不料有如此便利迅速，竟有認爲必須久候，携櫈帶糧以伺也。</p>
<p>程度相差甚鉅</p>
<p>但與中區相較，以西區保甲改組之後，不啻重新做起，尤因地勢特殊，人民知識程度，高低相差甚鉅，高者爲國府特任官吏，低者爲棚戶苦力，情形複雜，中區保甲向稱組織健全，如老閘區皆爲商業經構，人民知識水準相差甚微，居民鱗次櫛比，易於管理。西區則地廣人稀，管理尤屬匪易，在工作效率上，或有事倍功半之處耳。至辦理移動，及出生死亡，亦訂有辦法，切實奉行。總之，舉凡與人民有便利之處者，無不盡力，事求畢舉，予以迅速便利，一掃從前以保甲爲職業化之心理，而給予人民以良好之印象也。</p>
<p>警局統一　警察訓練</p>
<p>本市警察局對警察敎育訓練問題，頗爲關切，前第一警察局原有之榆林路敎練所及模範警察敎練所，業經合併成立「上海特別巿警察局警察敎練所」，統一警察敎育定宜，訓練所屬員警，培植新警察，提高警察敎育程度，灌輸警察常識，務使每一警察能明瞭警察使命，指導民衆遵守法令，確維地方治安。惟原有榆林路之敎練所，不敷應用，將前第二局在南市之敎練所設置分所，該分所不久將移入打浦橋前模範警察敎練所辦公，至於巿警察局敎練所所長一職仍由蘇副局長兼任，對於人事方面，無甚更動。</p>

<p>五日中午林官長假華懋飯店歌宴中日報道當局，曁中日新聞界，盟邦海軍報道部長松島大佐，席間鬯談太平洋戰况，幷申述日海軍作戰秘訣，聞者甚爲驚嘆動容。茲誌其談話要點如次：回憶大東亞戰爭爆發之後，日本以英雄奮戰之精神，一氣呵成，迅速摧毀英美在太平洋之根據地，造成奇偉之戰果。就大宮島（關島）言之，日軍僅費一日之時間，佔領其大部，幷攻陷其要衝，不出數日完全佔領，使敵人倉惶敗潰。反之，敵方此次反攻大宮島，自上月廿一日登陸該島以來，已逾兩週，而所佔領者不過一部份地方，其餘軍事要點，仍握於我軍手中，敵人萬分痛感反攻之困難，彼此攻擊力量，相差之鉅，明若觀火。至於敵方以佔據一微小地方，即大事宣傳其勝利，但海戰之勝敗絕不能以東佔一島，西據一嶼，即謂勝利，海戰之勝敗，必以主力艦隊之決戰爲歸趨。敵人前日已出沒於小笠原羣島之東邊，但小部艦艇或飛機之蠢動，殊不値驚訝，此後敵人或將出沒於琉球羣島或台灣方面，但我方對於敵方此種遊擊海上之作戰，毫不介意。查海戰戰略，此種北自小笠原羣島，南至塞班島一帶之中部太平洋之廣汎海面，絕非最後決戰之塲所，海軍之決戰，必在狹小之海面，故對敵人之蠢動，幷不驚動，我方正在冷靜準備中。並檢討一舉擊滅敵主力艦隊之塲所與時期。</p>
<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3 id="c24">盼發最後宏願　帮助三千餘失學靑年 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>本屆申請助學學生，經各級學校六百餘單位的當局負責推薦，初步審査合格者共七千餘人，其中除大學高年級學生以外，約六千五百餘人，業已完畢本報主辦之筆試程序，正在趕辦審查考試成績。據一般觀察，應試學生的成續，大部分合乎「優秀」的標舉。換句話說，就是大部分學生應該給予補助。如果應該給了補助而不予補助，在申請學生因失學而感到失望。在本報同人感到內心莫名的難過。在讀者諸君也必感到同情的不忍。</p>
<p>爲什麼應該給予補助而不予補助呢？唯一的原因是「錢」不够分配。本屆助學金原以一千萬元爲徽募與遝用目標，但因物價激漲，學費增加，超出預算極大。因此，一千萬元的徽募目標雖已達到，而運用自標却難圓滿。依照目前假定補助標準，一千萬元僅能補助三千學生。這樣，就有半數以上的學生應予補助而愛莫能助了。這使我們感到內心莫名的難過。</p>
<p>本來，在助學運動中我們不過盡了些微的棉力賴讀者諸君的捐欵。我們爲了三千餘個應該補助的學生獲得升學機會，誠懇地請求讀者諸君更發最後是宏願，多多捐助。</p>

<h3 id="c26">西線决戰為期不遠 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>東綫撤退戰略</p>
<p>再看東部戰綫，迄今日止，紅軍在中部的夏季攻勢之特色，自前週以來，戰綫在短期間雖獎動頗烈，然戰鬥並不激烈。這就是德軍依然堅特有計劃的作戰的意思。</p>
<p>蘇聯在維德布斯克，莫其列夫之間尋求攻勢之鍵，不滿一星期，推進了三百公里，目前戰綫移至迪那布爾格，莫洛特奇那，拍拉諾維區之間。其攻勢不可謂不大。但德軍雖大幅徹退，且不管蘇聯怎樣宣傳，並不蒙受任何打擊。這可以證明是爲了縮短戰綫，保存戰力，而作有計劃的撤退。</p>
<p>蘇軍更在中部占領果威爾，這是立即向倫堡方面進來的的先驅呢？抑即將在南部羅馬尼亞戰錢開始大攻勢，且在何時用何種形式發動？一時殊難斷言。</p>
<p>紅軍動向微妙</p>
<p>紅軍的進攻力，由於斯達林格勒以東一年半的繼續攻擊所致的疲勞，與補給路的延展，戰爭三年間損失，因涸竭而漸趨低落，是不容否認的，但據專門家所見，如德軍有事於西部戰綫，則仍有繼想本年夏季至冬季的大攻勢之餘力。尤以德方觀測，蘇聯不會放過這好機會。數日前蘇聯新聞報曾謂：</p>
<p>「紅樓軍並以收復失地而停止行動，爲打倒納粹政權，將與西部呼應，繼續進攻」。</p>
<p>這不用說是對英美西部戰綫的支援。因這聲明，故紅軍或許不致不顧犧牲，繼續前進，萬一德軍在西部陷於苦戰時，必將立即往東部出以大攻勢，不然，則將避免無理牲犧，休養戰力，徐圖恢復戰略地點，而取靜觀西部決戰趨勢的態度。</p>
<p>又目前從義國北進以轉變西戰錢膠着局面的英美軍，在南國登陸，紅軍爲呼應起見，亦有企圖席捲羅馬尼亞的可能性。要之，紅軍縱尙有續取攻勢的餘力，然德軍對的此態度，不顧西部的決戰，必將盡力堅守東部的最低限度之綫，以疲勞的蘇軍，如敢於侵人此錢，將受難於恢復的打擊。這是中立國軍事專門家的意見。</p>
<p>西綫決戰兵器</p>
<p>如此看來，德軍「東守西攻」戰略的意義，不言而喩。即紅軍雖因消耗與疲勞，然德軍如欲於短期間傾全力打倒紅軍，不僅非常困難，而且德國舉全力東進時，背後有被英美軍從西部南部進迫的威脅。</p>
<p>反之，如暫時犧牲東部，則以疲勞的紅軍，沒有攻至德國本土的餘力，這時候集中重心於西部，在比較短的期間內，給與英美侵入軍以殲滅的打擊，不是完全不可能的。但德軍整個兵力的配置，在東部的兵力，或許依然比西部的為多，但這無妨於以西部爲戰略的重心。德國在其最艱苦的期間，隱忍自重而大量生產的V一號及其他將出現的新武器，不使用於危機頻傳的東部戰綫，而忍耐至今，實是爲了等待這戰機，以西部的勝利來轉變整個戰局。</p>
<p>德有絕對信念</p>
<p>然西部戰局雖有將士英勇防禦，但由於敵方壓倒的空軍優勢及其他，戰事的展開不能說順利。中立國軍事專門家亦有作下列論調者：</p>
<p>「德軍應無動於蒙特巴頓軍的登陸聲勢，覺悟不可免的犧牲，擊退諾曼第的英美登陸軍，以謀戰機的轉變。」</p>
<p>但德國官民則完全相信最高指導的方策，而確佰最後的勝利。這信念有何根據呢？德國有力人士將異口同聲答稱：</p>
<p>一，最高指揮部發揮內綫作戰妙締的神計妙算。</p>
<p>二，戰敗則德國將永遠滅亡，前綫將士與後方民衆都有這覺悟。</p>
<p>三，保證勝利的新兵器之準備。</p>
<p>而據可靠消息，宣傳已久的德新說空軍，即將出現，雙方空軍的均衡，因此而有變動。最近總統打破了長期的緘默，接連發言二次，一是哀悼第特爾將軍之死，賞讚將軍稱：</p>
<p>「一個人的大力，往往將視爲不可能者實現之」。並暗示今後戰局的困難，繼在大本營招待技術者，科學者席上，表彰：</p>
<p>「德國之軍事技術與科學，軍需生產，爲戰勝之有力的背景。」</p>
<p>此可解釋爲德國目前所有的新兵器，成爲總統在同席上所聲明的「我們必勝一之重要因子。總之，西部的決戰不久即將達最高潮，英美的夢想至是成爲泡影，德國的信念即可實現，吾人試耐心拭目以待。（完）（翔：譯自七月向日讀賣新聞）</p>

<p>— 艦隊報道部　鹽田大尉</p>
<p>廣播學說詞</p>
<p>各位聽衆，本人是艦隊報道部的鹽田大尉，敵人美國的太平洋艦隊，自從占領了太平洋上一個塞班島以後，現在更利用餘下的勢力，來襲擊關島。但是美國與英國的作戰首腦部，仍習是非常憂慮，非常煩悶。只有不懂得海戰的重慶指導者，以及美國的國民和官吏，卻把塞班島占領的消息作爲好的材料，大事虛妄的宣傳。相反的，英國的作戰首腦部，保持很沉默的態度，給一般市民一個警告。從這一點看來，我認爲英國究竟是一個海軍國家，是一個可怕的國民，海戰的目的，就是在擊破敵人的海上武力，所以在廣大的太平洋上，被占領的塞班島，縱使在戰略上有意義，可是在艦隊還沒有決戰的現在，大東亞戰爭的戰局依然沒有絲毫的影響。敵人美國英國的作戰首腦部，依然心裏不安，我們國民所以還堅信最後的勝利，那個是理由完全是因爲日本的聯合艦隊依然健在的緣故。並且本人今天希望講給各位聽的，就是日本的聯合艦隊，最近有很顯著的增強，同時在自己所希望的地方和時期內，每天在找著戰鬥的機會，准備雲敵人美國的艦隊。近代國家在傾全力的作戰的現在，決沒有短期戰的理由。</p>
<p>三期作戰准備</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發以來，已經過了兩年八個月了，在這個時間內，一定有幾個作戰的階段。今日的戰局，對於我們已經是第二期作戰階段的末期，而就將要進入第三期的作戰階段了。在第一期作戰的階段裏，我們獲得了大成功，獲得了作戰所必要的物資，並且更尊重原住民的意見，實行軍政上最好的方法。時不時在這個階段裏，一舉擊破敵人美國和英國的海軍根據地，完全成立了日本海軍的必勝狀態。所以到了第二期作戰階段的時候，作戰的方法也變成到長期保持前哨基地了，在這個時候，時不時更進行第三期的作戰准備。我們的計劃很順利的進展，按照原來的計劃，自從前年八月以來，單靠物資數量爲武器的敵人，不但遭遇到莫大的犧牲，並且他們的艦隊，好像第二個波羅的海艦隊，或像西班牙的無敵艦隊，在補充與人的損害之下，對於遠征作戰感覺到非常的棘手。試一試看世界海戰歷史上，沒有遠征艦隊得到勝利的歷史。</p>
<p>假使日本的艦隊極爲劣等的話，那麽美國的艦隊或者能夠創造遠征艦隊得勝的歷史；但是敵人絕對不能創造這種歷史，因爲日本的艦隊依然是世界的大艦隊。自從塞班島作戰以來，這種第二期作戰已經自動的向第三期作戰進行。我們在第二期作戰以來，不論在各種艦艇方面，尤其在航資兵力方面，已經費了極大的努力，充分准備了第三期作戰的實力，所以日本聯合艦隊把遠道所困疲的美國艦隊擊滅的時候，也就是第三期作戰開始的時候。因此，第三期作戰是對採取攻勢。作戰的時候，對於頻潰滅的敵人開始總迫擊，再將迫追到夏威夷的。</p>
<p>一舉擊滅敵人</p>
<p>所以我拉的戰略，若是敵人的艦隊越是焦急，越是出擊，即結果根據孫子兵法，「以逸待勞」的作戰原理，我們的艦隊將要對敵人艦隊以更大的打擊，把他們的艦隊完全擊滅。並且我們不但是對於美國海軍，並且將英國艦隊也計算在內。我們確信一定能夠得到最後的勝利。凡是艦隊作戰的要訣是在「先發制人」和「集中」的兩點。換句話說，若與敵人艦隊遭遇的時候，在沒有受到敵人的攻擊以前。先雲攻擊敵人，使他潰滅，這就是先發制人。那麽集中呢，這就是不使自己艦隊的兵力分散，集中全部兵力，不論甚麽時候都能出擊，一舉攻擊敵人。從以上看來，敵人這一次的占領塞班島，對於美國實在是很不幸的事，反對於日本艦隊實在是一件幸福的事，換句話說，就是「割我之肉，碎敵之骨」的機會，現在已經到了。雖然如此，還有一部份不能理解海戰的人，都在下很簡單的判斷，他們看塞班島的事，發生了「日本艦隊是否健在」的疑問，可是我們聯合艦隊沉默的按照預定的作戰計劃前進，決不因戰局的一喜一憂而活動的事，而在預定的地方，預定的時期，准備給敵人空前的打擊。所以在擊滅敵人以前，我們任憑英美敵國去作虛妄宣傳，等待機會一到，可以拿事實使他們知道日本的聯合艦隊是怎樣的健全，保有怎樣強大的實力。本從剛才講過美國的占領塞班島，對美國是一件不幸的事，現在把理由說明一下：</p>
<p>第一塞班島的喪失，可以使日本國民一致團結，確立改用的決意。</p>
<p>集中全力生産</p>
<p>開戰以來，只有半年，而敵人美國和英國已經從廣大的大東亞裏被驅逐出去。所以日本國民對於戰局缺少重大的決意，但是塞班島失陷以後，國民受到空前未有的良好刺激，所以保守建國三千年來的光榮傳統，和風光媚美　國的愛國心，非常的昂掦，結果自私自利的私欲意識，以及種種利害得失的小問題，都因此完全消滅了。爲了報複塞班島的仇恨，不論婦女，不論少年，都盡力來參加生産，有錢的出錢，有物的出物，國民都一致團結，一點兒也沒有私欲，集中一切力量來紮頭繩戰力，這個時候，又組織了強力的新內閣來指導國民，真可說是兩個的幸福，　　世界無比的團結力和攻擊精神，一定能夠集中在增強戰力的軍需生産上面，最近幾個星期來的生産能率，各方面都有急速的增高，同時，指導者的熱心政策，亦與這點一致，日本的制造飛機，現在已經在　時期的增加生産，並且不論中學校的男女學生，都是傾全力在這一點上面。</p>
<p>還是船舶的生産，去年以來極可滿意，不過戰力增強越是強化，船舶亦越加重要，所以不但是在日本本國，連南洋占領地各方面造船工作還在一天比一天的進行著。</p>
<p>過去有種種理由，不能實行的地方，現在也都實行，職業的轉換，各種工業，現在又正在改編著，使都能夠參加增強戰力。這種現狀，都是表示日本國民都是真正的爲了戰爭的狀態，敵人美國，現在不論在生活上，不論在勞力上，已經遠到極點了，我們也從現在奮起，向採取勝利的道路邁進。在天時，地利，人和都對我們有利的今天，一定得到勝利。</p>
<p>總而言之，日本的海軍，現在有了正在充分發揮的生産力，以及過去所保有的數量，技術和精神，並且更有准備攻擊敵人的計劃，將要按照戰略，使敵人陷入我們的戰略，同時，敵人乘機占領各島，使我們有機會把他們澈底的粉碎。我們聯合艦隊將士的態度，將要爲世後的歷史家所贊美。</p>

<p>目從四月十八日日軍渡過黃河及新黃河以來，中國戰線即已化爲一大決戰之場。其後約三個月間，戰局的發展與日俱增。起初，戰火似將延及河南的沃野，日軍大有衝入關中盆地之勢，不料在湖南平原上又起烽火，日軍旋即占領長沙，攻入衡陽機場，確保二大據點，更在浙江方面進攻衢州，而華南日軍亦沿粵漢線北上。目前，第一第九第七三戰區，皆有的劇烈戰爭，戰線之長，實達二千三百五十公里，洵爲中日事變以以來的最大作戰。日軍此次軍事行動的目的，如日本政府七月五日聲明，主在「摧毀英美侵寇制制的企圖」。</p>
<p>三個月以來的日軍新作，經過四個階段而迅速展開。日軍先由華北黃河河畔發動攻勢，攻陷鄰州許昌之後，至一月九日遂打通了京漢線，二十五日更攻克第一戰區最大據點洛陽，日軍前鋒日進抵潼關附近。此爲第一階段的作戰。</p>
<p>五月二十七日，日軍新銳部隊突在江南的洞庭湖行動，至六月十八日攻拔重鎮長沙，同月廿六日並取得駐渝美空軍的大據點衡陽飛機場，目前戰事仍在進行中，以長沙及衡陽機場的攻略爲二大重點的湖南作戰，即爲第二階段。</p>
<p>至於日軍作戰的第三階段，即系衢州攻略；第四個階段則爲華南日軍沿粵漢線北上。（譯自朝日實報七月十九號）</p>

<h3 id="c31">腳的遺憾 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 任淑芳</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>趙老闆生平唯一憾事就是他的太太有一雙小腳，到現在趙太太過世了，趙老闆改邪歸正地一心做生意，逢人提起他太太時候，總還歎著氣說「玉萍哪！樣都好，就是一雙小腳，唉！一雙小腳。」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>十三年前趙老闆還是個小子，趙康年在一家布店裏當夥計，靠一個月二十元的薪水維持他和母親的生活，那時趙老闆已有十十八歲了，還沒有娶房兒媳婦，一方面當然是爲了趙家沒有錢，另一方面趙康年眼界很高，說新的倒不少，但是他揀精揀肥一家都沒有成功。</p>
<p>就在這年，趙康年的姑母也來爲他說親，姑娘家是姓沈，父親和祖父都在清朝做過官，祖父還是前清的翰林，可是父親早過世了，就留下一個獨身女玉萍小姐，家裏還有些錢，也是爲了高不成，低不就，直到二十八歲還沒有出嫁，最不幸的平萍小姐在幼年時代，因爲他父親堅持著女兒一定要纏足，所以到現在她的腳還是一雙三寸金蓮，但是民國以後，女孩子的腳都解放了，西洋的風氣漸漸傳到東方來，時髦的小姐太太們早就燙發穿高跟鞋了，至於「朶朶蓮花」的那種腳的美態已被淘汰，不得已沈太太降低了擇婿的條件，貧富無關緊要，須身家清白，爲人可靠就是了。詳情經說明後，趙太太並不反對，據說玉萍小姐長得很俊，又有豐富的妝盒，趙太太知道她兒子也不會反對的，最難的一點，就是小腳的問題，趙老太太和姑母都是小腳，對於小腳並無惡感，況且現在一般女子的天足，在他們還有些看不順眼，他們商量的結果，覺得這親的好賠嫁是決不能錯過的，只須把小腳的事瞞過康年，待他們結了婚，木已成舟，不會再有什麽大問題了。</p>
<p>趙康年知道了這件事，又很憤重的，向女家討了個照片來看，玉萍小姐果然長得不錯，他於是在極瞞意的心情下答應了這件閑事。結婚的前天，沈家的嫁妝發過來，因爲是官家的後代，賠嫁的東西雙豐富，又精緻，並且還帶點古色古香，親戚朋友們都讚不絕口說是趙康年的造化來了，趙康年和他的母親不用說是非常得意的。</p>
<p>結婚的儀式是半新舊的，倒也很熱鬧，當資客們發現娘走路的姿態有些特別時，都在竊竊私議起來，最後他們看出了新娘是小腳時，大家都不約而同的發了一種感想：</p>
<p>哦，怪不得官家小姐會嫁到窮人家來！</p>
<p>康年因爲是新郎，西亞就忙不過來，更不意好思猴急地多看新娘，不過他發覺賓客們那種交頭接耳的怪態，也有些疑心起來，他想難道新娘有什麽缺點嗎？他挨至吃過晚席，便進新房把新娘細細地打量一番，還是一付美麗的臉蛋，瘦怯怯身材，含羞的姿態，康年慢慢注視到她的腳，啊！一雙小腳！康年覺得頭上被誰重重打了一下，他氣得立刻轉身出去，一個人躲在後院子的柴房裏，他想自己太粗心了，只注意人家的臉，恨沒留心至腳，但是他憶、恨恨地想：他這種文明世界娶老婆誰還去問大腳小腳呢！真是倒盡了楣，還有姑母既和她是鄰居，當然知道她是小腳爲什麽不早告訴我呢！這種時代人家都成雙作對在外面跑，她怎麽帶得出去呢？他一人越想越氣，幾手放聲痛哭起來。</p>
<p>剛吃好飯的賀客們，都准備著吵新房，卻找不見新郎，姑母到底是緦的也可以說是虛心的，知道也許康年已經發現新娘的缺點了，她並不聲張暗暗地四處找，終於在柴房裏找著了，一瞧康年的神氣，知道事情已經猜中，便連講帶勸地說：現在既已結了婚就是夫妻了，大家應該體諒對方，這種小枝節是無關大事的，況且一副豐富的嫁妝總到手了，拿這筆錢去做買賣，發了大財，漂亮的時髦的女人要多少，到那裏再娶好了。姑太太說了一套，康年聽了心裏至少寬慰了皯，就重跑出去和客人們週旋，新房並沒有鬧得十分起勁，一方面因爲姑太太說康年累了一天，人有些不舒服，一方面客人看新郎不高興的樣子，也就知趣地陸續散了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>婚後趙康年的心理時常發生衝突，可以說他還是有些喜歡玉萍的，因爲玉萍從照相上給他第一次的印像非常好，還有玉萍服待他很小心週到，什麽事不待他開口就已做好，這樣能幹體貼的太太，往往會使做了二十年單身漢的丈夫覺得結婚的好處太多了，康年就有這樣感覺，但是這種好感往往會被玉萍的小腳　除得一幹二淨，康年常常借些小事向玉萍發脾氣，玉萍除了低著頭流淚外什麽也不說，實在他早就知道這厄運是免不了的，趙老太太覺得兒子這樣的故意使氣有些看不過去，時常幫著媳婦說幾句話，日子久了大家也就慣常了。</p>
<p>二個月後康年當自母親和妻子的面前說，一輩子做人家夥計是做不出頭的，想和幾個朋友開一爿布店，就是沒有本錢，趙老太太聽了眼睛望望媳婦，玉萍早就會過意來，立刻進房去把手飾和現錢都拿了出來，放在丈夫的面臆，婆婆歡喜得瞇著眼睛笑，康年也喜悅的樣子，他覺得玉萍是個好妻子，在一種憐惜的心情下他只拿了一半的奉獻物。</p>
<p>康年的店讓開成了，做了老闆，五年之後布店漸漸興盛起來玉萍的錢和首飾差不多也快用完了，這時他們已有兩個孩子，康年生意做得大了，難得在家裏多坐一會，漸漸地康年賺了很多的錢，他拿到家來的有限，大半供他自己的享樂，時常整夜地不回來。趙老太太在日時常訓斥他，康年還有些畏懼，後來趙老太太死了，康年一點沒有顧忌，玉是更苦了，她整天地操勞家務，教養孩子，康年的脾氣是越變越壞，玉萍在他面前總是戰戰兢兢的，聽外人說康年和一個妓女來往很密，鄰居們看見趙老闆對玉萍的態度，都有些不平，反而玉萍倒淡然處之，其實她內心的痛苦誰能知道呢？</p>
<p>一霎眼十二年過去了，兩個孩子也大了，在母親嚴厲的教育下都很孝順上進，這是玉萍唯一的安慰，這十多年的操勞憂悒和氣憤，積成玉萍不治之病，在臨危的時候，她留戀地看看兩個孩子，還對康年說在她死後，希望他再娶一個大腳的太太！</p>
<p>玉萍死後康年也厭倦了外面的浪漫生活，時常想起玉萍生前的好處，愧對著兩個純正的孩子，覺得自己沒有盡過一分做父親的責任。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>現在大家都知道趙老闆不大出去胡鬧了，並且很愛兩個愛子，也不提續　話，逢人提起他太太時他還總惋惜地起說：</p>
<p>「玉萍啊！沒有一樣不好，唉！就是一雙小腳！」</p>
<h3 id="c32">憂愁與白發 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 燿青</p>
<p>憂愁就可以使人的頭發立刻變白嗎？讓我先引述幾個實例：</p>
<p>在一七九三年的十月十四日，法皇路易十六的皇后安間娜特，被送上了斷頭台。她是在行刑前一天才被頭版死刑的。判決和行刑，相隔雖僅有一夜的時光，但她的頭發竟變成蒼白了。</p>
<p>據瑞士的一位古代歷史家西斯蒙底，也曾說過一椿頭發突然變白的故事。他說，古代有一個在君士坦丁堡學習希臘文的學者，他於學成回鄉的時候，携帶著兩箱希臘文的稿件，這些稿件也就是他孜孜不　，研究的結晶品。但在歸途中，因爲他所乘的船遇險被打破了，所以那箱稿件便喪失了一箱。那一箱東西是他費了許多心血得來的，是無價之至寶，一旦喪失，他的憤悶，自然可想而知了。結果也是過了一夜，他的頭發便變成蒼白了。</p>
<p>因爲強烈的神經刺激一個叛變的軍士，他不幸而使頭發變白的還有一例被捕，便被帶到英國當局。以前在孟加拉軍隊中有的而臆，加以審問，他的軍裝和一切衣服，全被剝去，赤身裸體的被其他兵士們團攏著。他全身極強烈的戰憟著，他的恐懼與失望很深刻的表現在他的面孔上，他好像成了一個呆子。當他實際被　審問的時候，僅在半小時的時間，他進來時頭上的烏發便統統變成蒼白了。據說，親審的人起先還未覺出，當審問官忽然呌出來：「他怎麽頭發變白了！」大家才注意。在許多例子中，這一件可以說是最是驚人的了。</p>
<p>前面所舉，都是外國的事情。在中國，不是也有一件婦孺皆知的頭發變白的故事嗎？那就是伍子胥過昭關。他因爲太憂愁了，只怕闖不過關去，所以一夜之間，頭發統統變白，所謂「一夜發白過昭關」。守關的人因爲認他不清了，他才得混過關去。這個故事，在京戲上演來，有「文昭關」和「武昭關」之分，但不論「文」「武」，演時那位節伍子胥的　生，剛出場都是掛黑髯，以後唱一段，變換上黑白相間的髯口，最後便換金白的了。</p>
<p>頭發之所以突然變白，常是在神經極度緊張之後，如非常的憂愁，或極費心思的艱難工作，倘比人的生活再是一種靜坐不動的，更易發生這種現象。所以，假如你不願你的頭發很快的變白的話，那除了先天的「少白頭」無法避免外，還是請你少憂愁！</p>
<h3 id="c33">推動和補助 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>每一個人有二個時期－－學習時期，發揮時期。</p>
<p>學習時期，我們需要天資，志向，家境，環境：發揮時期，我們需要識見，財勢，機會，精神：來建樹成功的基礎。</p>
<p>但，事實上，我們不可能每一個人皆具備如許條件，那末，「誰都有成功的希望」是一句廢話嗎？不！因為其中特長的會補助我們其他缺乏的。那末，「失敗」是多餘的名詞也？不！假使我們不盡力去推動這些可能獲到的值得利用的建樹基礎原則，決計無從享受此種補助，結果就是失敗了！</p>
<p>呵，彷徨着的人們呵！你們愛接受「學習是一個問題，將來又是一個問題！」傷感的論調呢還是「當我們野心推動熱心趨向決心；能力推動毅力趨向努力的時刻，正是我們成功所需要的補助將臨的時刻！」樂觀的論調？（維翰寄自東京）</p>

<h3 id="c34">來去怱怱，別矣健兒　送別體友隊 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>北平體友籃球隊，繼北星籃球隊冒溽署南來。在滬四戰，三勝一負，博得好譽，較北星征滬，固有更滿意之收穫，不廣此行。計在滬第一戰以四十三對三十四勝汕隊，第二戰以四十五比三十二壓倒明星，第三戰更發揮其實力，以二十四對十九敗退西隊巨蒙聯軍。最後一役，以三十三對三十入慘遭舉聯毒手。在此四戰之中，筆者以為戰華聯一役，體友演出最佳。其北方球藝較勝於南方之點，發揮無遺，未能以勝敗論也。筆者現就該隊各方面加以分析，及談隊較北星進步之點，不當之處，極願各界指敎。</p>
<p>比較北星</p>
<p>前北星來滬時，筆者曾指為球路狹窄，獲球太少，二大缺點，而此次體友隊對此一點，確已有顯著之改革。觀乎其進攻時之站位方式，在穿花挾蝶中，始終能保持成三角形。而常英則始終利用其敏捷閃避，能站到其有把握投籃之地位。其站成三角形，或以鋒，或以衛，變幻甚連，敵極易為之離迷。其次即對於獲球權已深知甚重要。猶憶北星征滬時，投擲不中之球，極少有跟人進。此次體友則不然，凡不中之球，郭湧恩郭耀雋均能利用其彈性之足，竭力跟進。或獲球後再傳出，不致喪失獲球權。以上二點，確為較北星進展之處。</p>
<p>其次評其戰術及其他方面：</p>
<p>攻速守緊極為可取</p>
<p>其進攻時利用其鬆脆之作風，出手極快，頗能收敵隊，驟不及返陣之功。其守衛方式，以探人釘人制，尚未能純熟。故此次仍襲用五人聯防法。唯在聯防之中，必有一人在其區城內，緊逼敵方持球之人，不容其有瞬息空閒之時間而應用方法。此種守衛術，確可補不能用人釘人之缺撼，亦令敵方為之措手間難有發展。觀乎西隊及華聯均少有方法獲分，即體友守衛之成功也。</p>
<p>指導無人最大缺點</p>
<p>前北星點，而友南來，依然有此弊病。筆者殊不知其何以始終指導無人之理由。夫賽球固為球員之爭鬥，然指導之重要，固亦不亞于球員間之爭鬥。在歐西各國，有大比賽時，報間輒有以指導某某與某某之鬥為題。由此可見指導之關係，實巨且大矣。體支隊中竟無指導之人，以遠征軍而有此缺點，實引為遺憾，體友健兒以為然否？</p>
<p>道德固佳求勝太切</p>
<p>該隊道德，實表演北國健兒有禮貌之　度。如在調換隊員時，隊員入塲，俱向裁判行禮，此種敬重裁判之禮貌，彬彬有禮，予觀眾以極佳印象，亦所以示裁判之尊嚴也。唯該隊此次此賽時，求勝心太切，如分數一落人後，即有慌張及較為粗野之舉動。似有非勝不可之心。此一方面固為健兒本色，另一方而當為其心理方面，尚未訓練到純靑之境耳。</p>
<p>體友來也匆匆，去也匆匆。上期筆者方致歡迎，本期即寫送行。匆忙之間其予我之印象，使如上述失。現體友一行，已于前晨北返，別矣，體友！努力前程，願他日在籃球季節時，再　申江有更進之表演，則不負此行這苦，又前聞體友並有女子隊司來，頗使此間人十關心相當商，調于北國巾幗之程度如何？極為隔機，尚希體友北返後，將此點在北平申述，異日來時，使男女為隊，均得南北交流，更為我人所股望者。</p>
<p>歡迎詞方致，驍歌遂唱。在寫斯文之後，對于人事間之離敘，不禁起蹈然之感。別矣體友！祝體友全體康健！</p>
<h3 id="c35">女排球決賽前　檢計綠聯三省實力 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>排球聯賽，大勢已定，上期巳論之。女組則自志騫敗於綠隊之後，再屈服於三省旗下，故目下已成綠隊三省兩隊爭霸局面。志騫心有有餘而力拙，不得不自慚形穢，實有負我人當時之殷望矣。現綠隊三省已定於明日（七日）決賽，筆者觀察兩隊之優點及缺點，乃作斯篇，所以希望在決賽之中，有新的演出，提高女排水準，不僅為斤斤錦標，則幸矣。</p>
<p>組織方面　三省較勝</p>
<p>按綠隊之組織原純為籃球。此番突然組織排球隊，全為愛好運動，及一種嘗試而已。初未計及有此良好之收穫也。而三省隊則本以排球為主，籃球乃輔耳。是則以組織而言，三省至少已有一年以止之默契，而綠隊則僅有二三月之歷史，其間之相差不言可喻。唯錄隊既以隊員天賦其材，且得名家指示，異軍突起，令人刮目相看。茲評二隊之優劣及作預測焉。</p>
<p>談綠隊</p>
<p>綠隊陣容，不論頭二三排，均極平均，尤以二排為最標準，可稱為全滬各女隊之冠，此非過譽。王維珍之主中，身材活潑，且不避傾跌，故對於救球方面，允以為最上乘。黃查分右之，杏芳經驗老到，而一記猛擊絕少越野，決非其他人選可及。明媛左之，能救能擊，為二排中之標準人材。而頭排汪印蘭之腦筋敏捷，變幻莫測，以及三排諸將之　健，故不失為一人材平均之隊伍也。如能早有組織，則三省決非其敵。又錄隊所賴獲分者有三人，」為印蘭之吊角及扣殺，餘為查分明媛之猛敲，有此三人可以獲點，則戰術應用能得，常自可隨心所欲，當者披靡矣。</p>
<p>話三省</p>
<p>三省隊能得分者，僅為頭排陳梅貞一人。唯陳之扣殺，十有九中，乖而有力，出手又快，對方極難遏制及救出。故表面三省雖屬能得分者較少，以其有相當把握，固不讓他隊也。救球方面，三省尚未能登堂入室，良莠不齊，所幸合作已見默契，尚無爭奪失誤之弊。是則談隊祗求陳梅貞能暢所欲者，便可高唱捷歌也。</p>
<p>再與兩隊檢討戰術</p>
<p>綠隊要勝，衆以為極少可能。筆者則並不以為然。錄隊能求戰術之變幻，大有壓倒三省希望。其主要點，當先求如何阻止陳梅貞之扣殺，則唯鎖網，夫鎖網在排球賽中，即獲點最好之途徑。如能鎖住陳梅貞，必勝無疑。萬一鎖不住，則應注意其落點之地位，盡力挽救。如綠隊能做到此二點，再用印蘭杏芬明媛之連袂進襲。且三省三排較弱，綠隊進攻之球，可多向三排引送，則彼未必能托至頭排陳梅貞處。三省將以何勝耶？致三省隊取勝之道，固在於一心，如何供給梅貞？然鄙意梅貞究屬長力有限，且攻路唯一條終非得策。亦使其他球員之水準，永難提高。況該隊在練習時，陳榴珍史遞娟極多猛擊，則何以比賽時便不能應用。故此戰應問而用之，使改變對方目標，則其演出，決不止現況而已。三省劉教練以為如何？又綠隊攻路較多，三省對付，亦當隨機應變。杏　之擊應鎖網，印蘭之扣，二排應敏捷注意其落點，徒鎖無益，不鎖亦可。明媛敲時，三排應特別注意，三省如能如此，庶可得矣。</p>
<p>總之，此一幕決賽，當為木屆女子排球最精彩之一幕。以兩隊實力之相伯仲，雙方指導之各具見地，以及球員之興奮，能有滿意之過程也。必欲預測其勝負成份者，則各佔其半。予言騐乎？球迷明日早臨中靑，觀後便知。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Critical Juncture <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Tomioka Sohō</p>
<p>With the determination of a hundred million citizens, there is no fear of ten million enemies.</p>
<p>Mr. Tomioka Sohō, a doyen of the Japanese press and a guest of the Mainichi Shimbun, is highly regarded for his moral character and literary works. After the heroic sacrifice of the soldiers and civilians defending Saipan Island, he delivered a broadcast to the Japanese people titled "Critical Juncture." His impassioned and resolute sentiments were palpable. This not only inspired the Japanese people but also serves as a reference for us. Therefore, we have translated and reprinted it as follows:</p>
<p>My one hundred million compatriots, the total sacrifice of the Saipan Island garrison is indeed a great regret! This time, it cannot be compared to the total annihilation on Attu Island. This point has already been announced by Imperial General Headquarters, and I believe you all understand it clearly, so there is no need for me to waste words. Only one thing, it immediately makes my hair stand on end, fills my chest with righteous indignation, and makes me wish I could eat the enemy's flesh and sleep on their skin. At the same time, regarding the soldiers and officers who died in battle, as well as the non-combatant Saipan Island compatriots, who so worthily displayed the true colors of the Japanese, I am truly filled with admiration and respect. The reason I specifically mention the non-combatants is that even though they had the opportunity to prolong their lives, they still followed the soldiers and officers to their deaths with composure for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor. I believe this will be forever recorded in history and will add a unique brilliance to the prestige of the Imperial Nation.</p>
<p>However, dwelling on past sorrows and hating the enemy will not help. The matter cannot be considered over. The lessons that our combatants and non-combatants have learned, both now and in the future, should be studied and utilized. We should not embrace the spirit of "the dead are dead," but rather, in future battles, we should carry forward and amplify their heroic spirit. I believe this is the most important and urgent thing. Now is not the time for empty talk, despair, or self-abandonment. Instead, we must take a broad view of the war situation and strive for victory. If we do not take a wrong step at this time, and if we properly handle the thorny situation and inherit the will of the martyrs who have sacrificed themselves, then there is no doubt that we will achieve final victory. At the same time, this is what I dare to guarantee with my integrity and assert to everyone.</p>
<p>This time, the enemy is fighting a desperate battle with a do-or-die mentality, pouring all its national strength into the attack. They want to defeat Japan in one fell swoop. This is because a long-term war is extremely unfavorable to them. As for why a long-term war is unfavorable to them, there is no need for me to explain in detail, as space is limited. In short, it is due to domestic problems.</p>
<p>In other words, under a long-term war, there is a danger of internal collapse, because internally, everyone is acting independently. The second is the foreign problem. They are like a three-legged race, with an unspeakable relationship of mutual suspicion and rivalry. Such an alliance, if it lasts for a long time, will naturally gradually loosen. They only believe that material power is omnipotent, and they want to defeat Japan at once with overwhelming material superiority. They believe that if they strike a blow, Japan will collapse, and then the internal front will be safe and sound, and the external front can also be eliminated. It is for this reason that they are attacking with the strength of the entire nation. Even so, things will not go as smoothly as they imagine, and Japan will not be defeated with a single blow. Instead, Japan will fight them to the end, until they are exhausted and their plans fail.</p>
<p>From this perspective, what should we do at this time? We must abandon short-term battles and entangle them in a long-term war. "They" actually refers to the United States. How do we entangle them? As long as Japan does not fail, this will naturally be a long-term war lasting a year. If it does not end in a hundred years, it will be a long-term war lasting a hundred years. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to endure hardship and labor, and display the spirit of the subjects of the Great Japanese Empire. With the traditional resilience of Japan over the past three years, which is to say, with courage that is increased a hundredfold every time we face a challenge, we must face any enemy before us with unwavering unity and determination, and fight to the end. Then, they will naturally weaken.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the enemy is gradually approaching our Japanese army. This means that they are farther and farther away from their own country, while we are closer and closer to our own country. The distance from Tokyo to Saipan Island and the distance from Washington to Saipan Island, even if I cannot say it out loud, everyone will know. Saipan is a place we can reach with a single hand, but for the enemy, it requires climbing mountains and crossing seas, a long and arduous journey. Therefore, when we see the enemy approaching, we do not need to be particularly afraid, nor do we need to worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In other words, the enemy is getting closer and closer to the range of our artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer and closer to death. The enemy is coming to Japan to die. Therefore, at this time, we must seize this opportunity, otherwise there will be no other day to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that there are two methods at this time. The first is the method that the ancient Romans used to deal with the Carthaginians. Today's British and Americans are like the ancient Carthaginians. The Carthaginian commander Hannibal and his men crossed the Mediterranean Sea, established a base in Spain, and then detoured through Spain, crossed the Alps, and charged straight into the vast plains of Italy. However, the Roman soldiers at that time were not so much victorious in every battle as they were defeated in every battle. Especially in the Battle of Cannae, the Romans were defeated even more miserably. As a result, seventy to eighty percent of the territory of Italy became occupied territory, and the only free area was the city of Rome and its vicinity.</p>
<p>However, the ancient Romans had backbone. The spirit of the ancient Romans was strong. The ancient Romans had confidence in the fate of their country. Their confidence in victory was devout and sincere. Moreover, with General Fabius, who often defeated the many with the few, General Hannibal, although he won many times, had no way to guarantee long-term success. Year after year passed, the military organization became lax, and the soldiers gradually became tired. Even if the generals still had an invincible spirit, their weapons had already become demoralized. Although offensives were constantly launched, it was impossible for them to achieve decisive results. At this time, the Roman army crossed the sea to attack Carthage itself, so Hannibal had no choice but to voluntarily abandon the siege and flee in panic. Finally, Carthage collapsed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Who were the Romans? If the Romans could do it, how could our Great Japanese Empire, with its three thousand years of history, be unable to do it? From this point of view, there is no reason for us Japanese to be discouraged, no matter how much the British and Americans torment us. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to strengthen the sense of urgency of our one hundred million compatriots. At the same time, we must further strengthen the wartime system. The wartime system mentioned here does not specifically refer to any court or regulations, but rather a psychological wartime system. That is to say, from now on, we must recognize that this is a difficult war. Regarding this point, the military authorities and government officials certainly have their own determination, but today I would like to specifically point out that whenever something happens, do not show indifference because the law is incomplete. It is people who create the law. It is also people who destroy the law. In an era without law, it is also people who create the law. As for what people are, this is actually the human heart. As long as we have the spirit, sincerity, and courage, then "I will go even if there are ten million people." Today, even if Americans and Britons come in droves, we dare to confidently believe that they will never have such a large number as our one hundred million compatriots. If so, what do we have to fear? What do we have to worry about?</p>
<p>However, what we should pay attention to today is not the ancient Romans, but the current Italians, because they have been tempted by the propaganda of the British and Americans and have suffered a humiliating defeat. No matter how eloquently the Anglo-Saxons try to lure us, we must know that they are deceitful thieves, they are pirates, they are bandits, they are villains who will do anything. If we trust them, we will fall into their trap.</p>
<p>Fighting is not simply a war between soldiers and soldiers. The most important battle is to crush the enemy's conspiracies. The enemy, on the one hand, hopes to subdue Japan in one fell swoop, and on the other hand, uses sweet words to win us over. Crushing such conspiracies is one of the most important tasks. However, the fundamental policy for crushing this kind of conspiracy is to strive to implement the Imperial Declaration of War and continue to achieve the goals indicated by the Imperial Declaration of War in order to defeat the enemy. As long as we have this determination, we are not afraid of anyone, and there is nothing to worry about. What we are afraid of and what we are worried about is being exploited by the enemy's schemes, so I hope everyone pays close attention. (Translated by Lu from the July 21st Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Adjusts Political and Military Strategies; Establishes Supreme Guidance Council; Prime Minister Koiso Encourages Military and Civilians to Advance as One <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 5th that, in order to plan the fundamental policies for war guidance and to coordinate political and military strategies so that they are mutually consistent, it has requested permission to establish a Supreme War Guidance Council. At the same time, it was also decided to abolish the continuous meetings between the Imperial Headquarters and the government, and instead hold regular information exchanges between the government and the Imperial Headquarters every week.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso issued a statement on the 5th, saying: "Today, I requested the establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council, which has been approved by His Majesty the Emperor and has been granted an Imperial Rescript. The establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council is to seek the realization of complete unity, to plan the supreme war guidance policy, and to coordinate political and military strategies so that they are consistent, in order to advance and complete the Greater East Asia War without any regrets. Upon receiving the Imperial Order, I am filled with apprehension. In today's critical situation, the coordination of command and national affairs is of utmost importance. I hope that military officers and civilians, both high and low, will deeply understand the Emperor's concerns, that all citizens will be united as one, and that they will advance with the spirit of selflessness and dedication to the public, in order to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council is composed of the heads of the army and navy and related cabinet ministers. In the future, the fundamental policies for guiding the war will be decided by this council, including the highest policy for military production, mainly aircraft. At this critical juncture, the determination to ensure Japan's survival and victory has now been fully established.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Fierce Fighting Continues in Burma During the Rainy Season; Chongqing Army Repelled by Japanese Forces on the Nujiang River <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – In Burma, the Chongqing army is continuing its operations in the rain in an attempt to open up the Ledo Road. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the Nujiang River front and in the Myitkyina area. The Chongqing army, with more than ten divisions, is fiercely attacking the Japanese forces securing key points on the Nujiang River front, such as Tengchong, Lungling, Mangshi, and Pingga. After being intercepted by the Japanese forces, they have been defeated and retreated. In the southern area, the Japanese forces are securing the area east and west of Nuwi (about 40 kilometers south of Kamaing), confronting about four divisions of the Chongqing army, Allied forces, and paratroopers, and inflicting heavy casualties on the Chongqing army. The Chongqing army in that area seems to be gathering troops near Kamaing and Mogaung to reorganize their forces. On the Imphal front, the Allied forces' offensives on the Ukhrul South area, the roads from Palel to Tamu, and the road junctions from Bishenpur to Tonzang have all been repelled. There has been no change in the battles on the Japanese front. In the area south of Hukawng, the Myitkyina area is frequently attacked by enemy aircraft, averaging about 90 aircraft per day. On the other hand, the Japanese air force is also taking advantage of the sunny days during the rainy season to cooperate with ground operations or attack enemy bases, and is continuing to fight bravely with limited forces. On July 27, one enemy aircraft was shot down near Manka, and on the 29th, Myitkyina was bombed, shooting down four P47 aircraft and destroying one P57 aircraft. On the 30th, the enemy airfield near Lake Gadok was bombed again, destroying many of its material warehouses and barracks, and shooting down one Douglas transport aircraft.</p>
<p>Recent Weekly War Situation in the South Seas</p>

In the New Britain and New Ireland areas, the enemy is encouraging local residents to attack Japanese patrol posts, so the enemy's attempt to invade the northern coast of the western end of New Guinea is becoming increasingly active. At the same time, the enemy has passed through Manokwari, Sorong, Babo, and other places, attacking Halmahera and the Ambon area. (2) In the Solomon Islands, from July 25 to August 1, a total of 630 enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul (20 shot down and destroyed).

Furthermore, 4.4 million yuan in embezzled funds should be recovered from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and approximately 1.3 million yuan in accumulated silkworm funds from the auction of the former criminals in Changshu have not yet been collected by the court. It is estimated that the total amount of embezzled funds that can be obtained in the future will be approximately 30 million yuan. Regarding administrative policies, after taking office, he will naturally inherit the unfinished aspirations of former Minister Zhang and strive to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="e9">US Forces Attacking Brittany Imitating Soviet Tactics; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Rennes Area <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: When the American forces invaded eastern Brittany, they adopted Soviet tactics, that is, advancing in a fan-shaped formation through narrow gaps, with one part of the army advancing along the main roads, and another part advancing across the fields, regardless of whether their flanks were exposed or whether they lacked rear communication lines. However, it is questionable whether the West European region is suitable for this. The American advance, attempting to bypass Saint-Malo and reach Dinan via Pontorson, was suppressed before it reached that city. The tank column advancing south from Pontorson reached Rennes and then advanced eastward through the city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: The focal point of the fierce fighting in northern France is currently the city of Rennes. The vanguard of a strong American force has entered Brittany and is now fighting bitterly with the German forces. To the south of Carhaix, the fighting strength of the German forces has increased. After repelling the British forces, they immediately began a counterattack. The 326th German Infantry Division has made particularly notable contributions, but its commander, Weicht, has died for his country.</p>

<p>In order to enhance their own strength and fulfill the mission of the news industry, the Chinese journalistic community is organizing the China News Association based on the basic principles of wartime cultural propaganda policy. A preparatory meeting and the first and second preparatory committee meetings were held yesterday (the 5th) at 10:00 AM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road in this city. Details of each event are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting began at 10:00 AM, presided over by Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department. In addition to Mr. Matsudaira, the Information Director of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, representatives from allied nations, the following members of the preparatory committee were present: Osaka Yoshiichi, Guo Xiufeng, Xu Liqiu, Qin Moshen, Jin Xiongbo, Wu Linzhi, and Chen Binhe. First, Minister Lin reported on the significance of establishing the China News Association, elucidating the shortcomings of China's past news industry and the future responsibilities of the China News Association. He then addressed the fundamental spirit of the association's ideal organization: strengthening the spirit of cooperation between the government and public opinion, eliminating individualistic capitalist and liberalistic tendencies, seeking cooperation and joint development of China's news industry, taking the allied nation of Japan, an advanced country in East Asian news industry, as an example, seeking close cooperation between the news industries of China and Japan, and advancing toward the goal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. His explanation was extremely thorough. After Minister Lin finished his report, the first preparatory committee meeting was convened.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Minister Lin of Propaganda Department Hosts Sino-Japanese News Circles and Rewards Allied Reporting Authorities in Shanghai <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department hosted a banquet at noon yesterday (the 5th) on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel to thank the news industry and to commend the allied reporting authorities in Shanghai for assisting our colleagues in the Shanghai news industry. Minister Lin attended the reception on time. Guests included Zhang Ke, Deputy Director of Propaganda; Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency; Hu Yingzhou, Vice President; Wu Linzhi, Director of the Newspaper Management Office; Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office; Liu Shike, Director of the News Inspection Bureau; Zhong Youcai, Director of the Film Censorship Committee; Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Liang Shi, and Yang Huilang of the China Daily; Chen Binhe of Shen Bao; Zheng Hongyan of Xinwen Bao; Jin Xiongbai of Ping Bao; Lu Guangjie of Xin Zhongguo Bao; Huang Jingzhai and Zhu Kang of Guomin Xinwen; Nikko of Xin Shen Bao; Osaki and Moriyama of the Mainland New Report; and the Chief of Shanghai Army Reporting Division, Izubuchi; Akahoshi; Chief of China Fleet Reporting Division, Matsushima; Lieutenant Shiroyu; Information Chief of Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, Matsudaira; Vice Consul Fukuma, and more than seventy other people. Minister Lin Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Minister Lin delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Distinguished gentlemen from the allied reporting agencies, and gentlemen from the Shanghai news circles, I have come to Shanghai this time to express gratitude to the allied reporting authorities and the Japanese news circles for their assistance to the Chinese news industry, and to encourage our own news circles to work even harder. I have prepared this modest feast and am grateful for your presence despite the summer heat. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you that this morning, the China News Association held a preparatory meeting, and the results were very satisfactory. The reason for establishing the China News Association is that, given that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, all parties in politics, economy, culture, and propaganda are intensifying their efforts. We think of the allied frontline soldiers who are fighting bravely to defend their country and all the allied nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Those of us in the rear, especially those in cultural propaganda, should raise our pens and work hard for the Greater East Asia War. Based on this idea, I hope that the allied agencies and news circles can continue to help us, and at the same time, I hope that the gentlemen in our own news circles can continue to work hard. I wish that the news circles of China and Japan can further demonstrate the spirit of cooperation, concentrate the efforts of our two countries, and I wish for the victory of the Greater East Asia War," and so on.</p>
<p>Chief Matsushima Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Chief Matsushima then delivered a speech, saying: "At this stage when the war situation is becoming increasingly serious, but still far from our ideal, we stand at the forefront of cultural propaganda and feel the weight of our mission even more deeply. Even in Shanghai, the remaining forces of Britain and the United States still exist. Under this situation, how should we exert ourselves to accomplish our mission? The China News Association is being born and established at this time, and we deeply hope that it can work hard and accomplish its mission. We especially hope that Minister Lin can earnestly guide us at any time and work hard to win the Greater East Asia War. We sincerely wish Minister Lin even more effort and struggle in the future."</p>
<p>Our Newspaper President Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Our newspaper President Chen delivered a speech, saying: "Just now, Minister Lin and Chief Matsushima both spoke of the seriousness of the situation and the great responsibility of the news circles, and they encouraged the colleagues in the news circles to double their efforts. However, Shanghai is a city of rumors. The more serious the situation, the more rumors there are. The stock market soared a few days ago, which shows the power of rumors in Shanghai. I have always deeply pondered why rumors can have such great power. The power of rumors is the failure of our formal propaganda. I believe that we should have two countermeasures in the future. First, the news circles themselves should improve their propaganda techniques. Second, we expect the entire political situation to improve. Whether it is central or local politics, it must improve so that we have materials to propagate. There is one more request to Minister Lin. Minister Lin has come to Shanghai this time to meet with our news circles, and I hope that he can also connect with the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai, because at present, most of the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai almost do not trust the news published in the newspapers. I hope that the Minister can tell them the actual situation in the future so that they can understand. This suggestion is based on the fact that the last time the naval authorities held a symposium on the Pacific war situation, the result was very effective. At the same time, we hope that the allied army reporting authorities can exchange opinions on the situation of the war on the Chinese mainland and the information department of the embassy on the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. Although the situation is serious, we should make the leaders of all sectors of society understand the seriousness of the situation. It is not enough to rely solely on newspaper propaganda. Just now, Chief Matsushima hoped that our China News Association would work hard, and I hope that we can give play to the spirit of autonomy and carry forward the spirit of autonomy to repay Minister Lin and the expectations of the allied reporting authorities," and so on. The conversation was extremely lively, and the banquet ended in joy at around 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has found that the air defense authorities have stipulated that when a warning is issued, pedestrians and vehicles must stop for five minutes and then proceed as usual. When an air raid alarm is issued, pedestrians must stand on the sidewalks for fifteen minutes and then proceed on the left side of the sidewalk. However, general police and self-defense corps members often misunderstand and treat it as a terror lockdown, not allowing passersby to pass, and even creating difficulties for air defense personnel with the department's armbands, which seems to be inconsistent with the principles. Therefore, the police department has ordered its police officers and self-defense corps members to correct this and to provide convenience to people after the specified time, and to allow air defense personnel with the department's armbands and certificates to pass at any time without creating any difficulties. The police department has ordered its subordinates to comply with this uniformly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Savings Association's 24th regular broadcast will be held today (the 6th) at 7:45 PM at the Shanghai Radio Station. The speaker will be Li Shiyu, Chief of the Judicial Section of the Police Department, who will speak on the topic of "The Relationship between the Savings Movement and Crime Prevention Work." At a time when the police authorities are promoting crime prevention work, it is believed that Chief Li will certainly provide a warning, save the declining customs of the world, and cause the unruly elements to reform their faults.</p>
<h3 id="e17">15th Phase of Sugar Sale Starts on the 9th <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has not only actively processed the citywide rice registration and prepared for the continued distribution of household rice in early this month, but has also begun to promote the 15th phase of sugar distribution to households in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts. With the cooperation of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, it has been decided that the citywide sale will begin on the 9th of this month. Each person can purchase five taels of sugar with their sugar certificate from the designated sugar merchants, for a total of 27.2 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The retailers are currently paying the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office for the sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Improvement of Baojia Work in West Shanghai; Increased Work Efficiency After Takeover <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that the Baojia affairs in West Shanghai were originally handled by the West Shanghai Office of the Municipal Government's Baojia Committee. Since the West Shanghai Police Bureau was merged into the First Police Bureau last year, the Baojia in the area has gradually been unified and is now under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. The Baojia Office took over from the Municipal Government Baojia Committee in November last year and established the West District Office of the Baojia Office. The position of director is concurrently held by Director Gu, and Fan Yi'an is appointed as deputy director to supervise the work of the Huashan and Changning sub-bureaus in the area. At the beginning of the establishment of the original Baojia in the area, the division of each Lianbao and the selection criteria for personnel were mostly improvised, which was inevitably somewhat strained.</p>
<p>Re-division of Lianbao</p>
<p>After the First Police Bureau's Baojia Office took over, Director Gu and Deputy Director Fan carefully planned and considered the actual situation in each area, drew up charts, and redivided the original first, second, and third wards into eight Lianbao in the Huashan Baojia area and seven Lianbao in the Changning Baojia area. The Huashan and Changning Baojia area Baojia Joint Committee was also organized, and Shen Siliang, Zhang Deqin, Feng Bingnan, Dai Yu, and Zhang Peishen were appointed as members. Le Fenglin was appointed as the Chief Lianbao of Huashan, and Zhou Mengbai was appointed as the Chief Lianbao of Changning. The selection of Lianbao chiefs and Bao chiefs was also carefully selected from factory managers or shop managers to improve their status and assigned accordingly. Since this personnel adjustment, in addition to collecting Baojia funds in accordance with municipal government regulations, it is strictly forbidden to collect more than necessary. A re-examination of the household registration was carried out to eliminate the abuses of overreporting in the past.</p>
<p>Reissuance of New Residence Permits</p>
<p>At the same time, the Huashan and Changning police sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction have been actively preparing for the reissuance of new residence permits in their respective jurisdictions. The Central District started on April 1, and the West District started on April 10 after the household registration was re-examined, the Baojia was reorganized, and various procedures were readjusted. The purpose of pressing fingerprints and exchanging new certificates is to facilitate the convenience of the citizens. Therefore, a precise statistic is made of how long it takes each citizen to fingerprint and how many can be processed each day. Then, in accordance with the order of each Lianbao and each Bao, the process is carried out in order, and the dates are notified separately to avoid the suffering of citizens waiting and squeezing. After the new residence permits are stamped by the Military Police Corps, the dates are specified, and each Bao chief is notified to send a representative from each household to exchange the permits. There is absolutely no deliberate delay or additional fees. In the event that the elderly, the weak, and pregnant women, as well as agencies, schools, factories, and social groups, are obstructed by their duties, they may request the police to go to their premises to press fingerprints and exchange new certificates. As for citizens who are unable to attend due to other matters on the specified date, they can go to the bureau on Sunday morning to make up the fingerprints and exchange certificates. Currently, the Huashan Baojia area averages over 1,200 fingerprint impressions and new certificates issued per day. The Changning Baojia area averages about 1,000 fingerprint impressions per day and about 500 new certificates issued. The entire process will be completed by September. The number of people processing new certificates is no less than that of the Central District, or perhaps even more. The general public did not expect the fingerprinting to be so convenient and quick. Some even thought they would have to wait a long time and brought benches and food to wait.</p>
<p>Great Difference in Level</p>
<p>However, compared with the Central District, the Baojia in the West District has been reorganized after the reorganization, which is equivalent to starting over again. Especially because of the special terrain and the great difference in the level of knowledge of the people, the high ones are specially appointed officials of the National Government, and the low ones are shack dwellers and coolies. The situation is complicated. The Baojia in the Central District has always been known for its sound organization. For example, the old Zha District is a commercial structure, and the level of knowledge of the people is very similar. The residents are lined up one after another, which is easy to manage. The West District has a vast land and sparse population, and management is especially difficult. In terms of work efficiency, it may take twice the effort to achieve half the result. As for the handling of movements, births, and deaths, there are also established methods that are strictly followed. In short, all efforts are made to provide convenience to the people, to achieve complete success, to provide them with speed and convenience, and to eliminate the psychology of professionalizing Baojia from the past and to give the people a good impression.</p>
<p>Police Bureau Unifies Police Training</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is very concerned about the issue of police education and training. The original Yulin Road Training Center and Model Police Training Center of the First Police Bureau have been merged to establish the "Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau Police Training Center" to unify police education and training, train subordinate police officers, cultivate new police officers, improve the level of police education, and instill police common sense. It is necessary to ensure that every police officer can understand the mission of the police, guide the people to abide by laws and regulations, and maintain local security. However, the original Yulin Road Training Center is not enough. A branch center was set up in the Nanshi of the former Second Bureau. The branch center will soon move into the former Model Police Training Center in Dapu Bridge to work. As for the position of director of the City Police Bureau Training Center, it is still concurrently held by Deputy Director Su. There is not much change in personnel.</p>

<p>Brown sugar is necessary for pregnant women, and pregnant women in the Nanshi district are in urgent need of allocation. It is reported that the Goods Allocation Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office are working together to alleviate the threat to the supply of brown sugar for pregnant women. Ten retailers have been designated in the district, and the sale has started in the district. All pregnant women in the district can apply for sale in accordance with the regulations. Each pregnant woman is limited to purchasing two market catties.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Chief Matsushima Talks About Naval Warfare Strategy; Gains and Losses of an Island Cannot Determine Victory or Defeat <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>On the 5th, Director Lin hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel for the Sino-Japanese reporting authorities and the Sino-Japanese news circles. Chief Matsushima, the Naval Reporting Director of the allied forces, spoke freely about the Pacific war situation and elaborated on the secrets of the Japanese Navy's operations. Those who heard it were amazed and moved. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: Recalling the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, with its heroic fighting spirit, quickly destroyed the British and American bases in the Pacific, creating great results. Taking Miyakojima (Guam) as an example, the Japanese army only took one day to occupy most of it and capture its key points, and completely occupied it in a few days, causing the enemy to flee in panic. On the contrary, the enemy's counterattack on Miyakojima has been going on for more than two weeks since they landed on the island on the 21st of last month, and only a part of the area has been occupied. The remaining military key points are still in the hands of our army. The enemy deeply feels the difficulty of the counterattack. The difference in the strength of each other's attack is as clear as fire. As for the enemy's great publicity of their victory by occupying a small place, the victory or defeat of a naval battle can never be said to be victory by occupying an island in the east and occupying an islet in the west. The victory or defeat of a naval battle must be determined by the decisive battle of the main fleet. The enemy has appeared east of the Ogasawara Islands a few days ago, but the movement of small ships or aircraft is not surprising. In the future, the enemy may appear in the Ryukyu Islands or Taiwan, but we do not care about this kind of guerrilla naval operation of the enemy. As for naval warfare strategy, this vast sea area in the central Pacific, from the Ogasawara Islands in the north to Saipan in the south, is by no means the place for the final decisive battle. The decisive battle of the navy must be in a narrow sea area. Therefore, we are not alarmed by the enemy's movement. We are calmly preparing and considering the place and time to destroy the enemy's main fleet in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Readers' News on Helping Students</p>
<h3 id="e24">Hoping to Fulfill the Final Great Wish to Help More Than 3,000 Out-of-School Youths <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>More than 7,000 students applied for scholarships this year, recommended by the authorities of more than 600 units at all levels of schools. After preliminary review, about 6,500 people, excluding senior students of universities, have completed the written examination procedure organized by this newspaper and are rushing to review the examination results. According to general observation, the students' performance in the examination is mostly in line with the "excellent" standard. In other words, most students should be subsidized. If a subsidy should be given but is not given, the applying students will feel disappointed because they cannot go to school. The colleagues in this newspaper feel an inexplicable sadness in their hearts. The readers will also feel sympathy and unbearable.</p>
<p>Why should a subsidy be given but not given? The only reason is that there is not enough "money" to distribute. The original goal of raising and using the scholarship this year was 10 million yuan, but due to the sharp rise in prices and the increase in tuition fees, the budget has been greatly exceeded. Therefore, although the goal of raising 10 million yuan has been achieved, it is difficult to achieve the goal of using it. According to the current assumed subsidy standard, 10 million yuan can only subsidize 3,000 students. In this way, more than half of the students should be subsidized but cannot be helped. This makes us feel an inexplicable sadness in our hearts.</p>
<p>Originally, in the scholarship movement, we only did a little bit of cotton power and relied on the readers' donations. In order for more than 3,000 students who should be subsidized to have the opportunity to go to school, we sincerely request the readers to make a final great wish and donate more.</p>
<p>The Gu Brothers Continue to Help Students</p>
<p>The Gu brothers, Xin Yi and Cheng Zhai, wrote a letter saying: "We have received your letter asking how the 'Dingfu Gong Shizhong Scholarship' will be paid in the next school year and whether there will be any changes in the number of recipients. We have replied to your letter and asked you to continue to handle it in accordance with the original plan. We are enclosing 25,000 yuan for the next semester's scholarship and ask you to check and distribute it separately on our behalf. We are very grateful."</p>
<p>Businessmen Take the Lead</p>
<p>The manager of a large restaurant in this city wrote a letter in the name of Jun Zhun Team, responding to the scholarship movement and donating 20,000 yuan. Chen Bingzhang, a gentleman from Sai Yuanchang Bank, wrote a letter saying: "I have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and raising scholarships to benefit poor students, cultivate talents, and store them for national use. Your benevolence and righteousness are admirable. Bingzhang is insignificant and dares to do his best. I am enclosing 10,000 yuan in national currency, which is a small amount, but it is for the students' living expenses and to express my gratitude." It can be seen that businessmen take the lead and will continue to follow the trend. The colleagues are waiting with incense.</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Decisive Battle on the Western Front Is Not Far Off <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Eastern Front Withdrawal Strategy</p>
<p>Looking again at the Eastern Front, up to the present day, the characteristic of the Red Army's summer offensive in the central sector, since the previous week, although the battle lines have shifted drastically in a short period, the fighting has not been fierce. This means that the German army is still adhering to a planned operation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union sought the key to its offensive between Vitebsk and Mogilev, advancing 300 kilometers in less than a week, and the current front line has moved to between Dinaburg, Molodechno, and Polotsk. Its offensive cannot be called small. However, although the German army has withdrawn significantly, and no matter how the Soviet Union publicizes it, it has not suffered any blows. This can prove that it is a planned retreat to shorten the front line and preserve combat power.</p>
<p>Will the Soviet army's occupation of Orsha in the central sector be a precursor to an immediate advance towards Lviv? Or will it launch a major offensive in the southern Romanian theater, and when and in what form will it be launched? It is difficult to say for the moment.</p>
<p>Subtle Movements of the Red Army</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the Red Army's offensive power is gradually declining due to fatigue from a year and a half of continuous attacks east of Stalingrad, the extension of supply lines, and losses during the three years of war. However, according to experts, if the German army is occupied on the Western Front, it still has the remaining strength to launch a large-scale offensive from this summer to winter. Especially from the German side's observation, the Soviet Union will not let go of this good opportunity. A few days ago, the Soviet News reported:</p>
<p>"The Red Army will not stop its actions by recovering lost territory. In order to overthrow the Nazi regime, it will echo the Western Front and continue its offensive."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is to support the Anglo-American Western Front. Because of this statement, the Red Army may not continue to advance regardless of sacrifice. If the German army is trapped in bitter fighting in the West, it will immediately launch a major offensive in the East; otherwise, it will avoid unreasonable sacrifice, rest and recuperate its combat power, slowly restore strategic locations, and adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the trend of the decisive battle in the West.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Anglo-American forces, currently advancing north from Italy to change the stalemated situation on the Western Front, are landing in the South. In response, the Red Army may also attempt to sweep through Romania. In short, even if the Red Army still has the remaining strength to continue its offensive, the German army, regarding this attitude, will spare no effort to defend the minimum line in the East, regardless of the decisive battle in the West, so that the fatigued Soviet army, if it dares to invade this front, will suffer a difficult-to-recover blow. This is the opinion of military experts from neutral countries.</p>
<p>Weapons for the Decisive Battle on the Western Front</p>
<p>In this way, the significance of the German army's "defend the East, attack the West" strategy is self-evident. Although the Red Army is suffering from depletion and fatigue, it is not only very difficult for the German army to use all its strength to defeat the Red Army in a short period, but also if Germany advances eastward with all its strength, it will face the threat of being attacked by the Anglo-American forces from the West and South.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the East is temporarily sacrificed, the fatigued Red Army will not have the remaining strength to attack the German mainland. At this time, concentrating the center of gravity on the West, giving the Anglo-American invading forces a devastating blow in a relatively short period, is not entirely impossible. However, the overall deployment of the German army may still have more troops in the East than in the West, but this does not prevent the West from being the strategic center of gravity. Germany, during its most difficult period, endured and produced large quantities of V-1 and other new weapons that will appear, not using them on the crisis-ridden Eastern Front, but waiting until now, in order to wait for this opportunity, to use the victory in the West to turn the entire war situation around.</p>
<p>Germany Has Absolute Faith</p>
<p>Although the Western battle situation has valiant defense by soldiers, the development of the war cannot be said to be smooth due to the overwhelming air superiority of the enemy and other factors. Military experts from neutral countries have also made the following arguments:</p>
<p>"The German army should not be moved by the landing momentum of the Montgomery forces, realize the inevitable sacrifice, and repel the Anglo-American landing forces in Normandy to seek a change in the battle opportunity."</p>
<p>However, German officials and civilians completely believe in the supreme guidance's policy and are certain of final victory. What is the basis for this belief? Powerful figures in Germany will answer in unison:</p>
<p>1. The Supreme Command utilizes the wonderful calculations of the inner-line operations.</p>
<p>2. If defeated, Germany will be forever destroyed, and the soldiers on the front line and the people in the rear all have this realization.</p>
<p>3. Preparation of new weapons that guarantee victory.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the long-publicized new German air force is about to appear, and the balance of air power between the two sides will change as a result. Recently, the President broke his long silence and spoke twice in succession, once to mourn the death of General Dietl, praising the general, saying:</p>
<p>"The great strength of one person often makes the impossible a reality." He also hinted at the difficulties of the future war situation. Subsequently, he hosted technicians and scientists at the headquarters, praising:</p>
<p>"Germany's military technology and science, and military production, are powerful backgrounds for victory."</p>
<p>This can be interpreted as all the new weapons currently possessed by Germany becoming "an important factor for our victory," as the President stated at the same meeting. In short, the decisive battle in the West will soon reach its climax, the dreams of the Anglo-Americans will become bubbles, and the faith of Germany can be realized. We will patiently wait and see.

<p>—Fleet Reporting Department Captain Shiota</p>
<p>Lecture Broadcasting Script</p>
<p>Dear listeners, I am Captain Shiota from the Fleet Reporting Department. The enemy, the American Pacific Fleet, after occupying Saipan Island in the Pacific, is now using its remaining strength to attack Guam. However, the American and British war leaders are still very worried and very vexed. Only the Chongqing leaders who do not understand naval warfare, as well as the American people and officials, are using the news of the occupation of Saipan Island as good material for major, false propaganda. Conversely, the British war leaders are maintaining a very silent attitude, giving a warning to the general public. From this point of view, I believe that Britain is ultimately a naval country, a fearsome nation. The purpose of naval warfare is to defeat the enemy's naval power. Therefore, in the vast Pacific Ocean, even if the occupied Saipan Island has strategic significance, the battle situation of the Greater East Asia War still has no impact whatsoever while the fleet has not yet had a decisive battle. The enemy American and British war leaders are still uneasy. The reason why our people still firmly believe in the final victory is entirely because the Japanese Combined Fleet is still healthy. And what I hope to tell you today is that the Japanese Combined Fleet has recently had a very significant increase in strength, and at the same time, within its desired location and time, it is searching for opportunities to fight every day, preparing to face the enemy American fleet. Modern countries have no reason for a short-term war when they are exerting all their strength in battle.</p>
<p>Three-Phase War Preparations</p>
<p>Two years and eight months have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Within this time, there must be several stages of operations. Today's battle situation is already the end of the second stage of operations for us, and we are about to enter the third stage of operations. In the first stage of operations, we achieved great success, obtained the necessary materials for operations, and also respected the opinions of the indigenous people and implemented the best methods of military administration. From time to time, in this stage, we completely destroyed the enemy American and British naval bases, completely establishing the Japanese navy's state of assured victory. Therefore, when we reached the second stage of operations, the method of operations also changed to maintaining forward bases for a long time. At this time, we also carried out preparations for the third stage of operations from time to time. Our plan is progressing very smoothly. According to the original plan, since August of the previous year, the enemy, who only relies on the quantity of materials as weapons, has not only encountered enormous sacrifices, but their fleet, like the second Baltic Fleet, or like the Spanish Armada, in replenishing human damage, feels very difficult to conduct expeditions. Try looking at the history of naval warfare in the world. There is no history of an expeditionary fleet winning a victory.</p>
<p>If the Japanese fleet were extremely inferior, then the American fleet might be able to create a history of a victorious expeditionary fleet; but the enemy can absolutely not create this kind of history, because the Japanese fleet is still the world's great fleet. Since the Saipan Island operation, this second stage of operations has automatically progressed to the third stage of operations. Since the second stage of operations, we have made great efforts in various types of warships, especially in aviation resources, and have fully prepared the strength for the third stage of operations. Therefore, when the Japanese Combined Fleet destroys the American fleet that is tired from the long journey, it will be the time when the third stage of operations begins. Therefore, the third stage of operations is to take the offensive. When operating, we will launch a general attack on the frequently defeated enemy, and then pursue them to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Destroy the Enemy in One Stroke</p>
<p>Therefore, in our strategy, if the enemy's fleet is more anxious and goes out to attack, the result, according to the principle of Sun Tzu's Art of War, will be "waiting at ease for the fatigued," and our fleet will deal an even greater blow to the enemy fleet, completely destroying their fleet. And we are not only including the American navy, but also the British fleet in our calculations. We are confident that we will definitely achieve final victory. The key to fleet operations is in the two points of "preemptive strike" and "concentration." In other words, when encountering the enemy fleet, before being attacked by the enemy, attack the enemy first and cause them to collapse. This is preemptive strike. Then, what is concentration? This is not to allow the strength of one's own fleet to be dispersed, but to concentrate all strength and be able to attack at any time, attacking the enemy in one stroke. From the above, the enemy's occupation of Saipan Island this time is really an unfortunate thing for the United States, but it is really a happy thing for the Japanese fleet. In other words, the opportunity to "cut my flesh and crush the enemy's bones" has now arrived. Even so, there are still some people who cannot understand naval warfare who are making very simple judgments. They see the Saipan Island incident and raise the question of "whether the Japanese fleet is still healthy." But our Combined Fleet is silently advancing according to the planned operation, and will never be active due to the joys and sorrows of the battle situation, but will prepare to give the enemy an unprecedented blow in the predetermined place and at the predetermined time. Therefore, before destroying the enemy, we will allow the British and American enemy countries to make false propaganda and wait for the opportunity to arrive, so that they can know with the facts how healthy the Japanese Combined Fleet is and how strong its strength is. Now, I will explain the reason why I just said that the American occupation of Saipan Island is an unfortunate thing for the United States:</p>
<p>First, the loss of Saipan Island can unite the Japanese people and establish the determination to reform.</p>
<p>Concentrate All Efforts on Production</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, only half a year has passed, and the enemy, the United States and Britain, have already been driven out of the vast Greater East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese people lacked a major determination regarding the war situation. However, after the fall of Saipan Island, the people received an unprecedented and good stimulus, so the patriotic hearts that preserve the glorious tradition of the founding of the country for three thousand years and the admiration for the beautiful United States were greatly uplifted. As a result, selfish desires and all kinds of small problems of gains and losses have been completely eliminated. In order to avenge the hatred of Saipan Island, regardless of women or young people, they are doing their best to participate in production. Those with money contribute money, and those with goods contribute goods. The people are united, without any selfish desires, and concentrate all their strength to tighten the ropes of war power. At this time, a strong new cabinet was also organized to guide the people. It can truly be said to be two kinds of happiness. The world's unparalleled unity and attacking spirit will surely be concentrated on increasing war-power military production. In recent weeks, the production efficiency has been rapidly increasing in all aspects. At the same time, the enthusiastic policies of the leaders are also consistent with this point. Japanese aircraft manufacturing is now in a period of increased production, and regardless of middle school students, both male and female, are putting all their efforts into this.</p>
<p>As for the production of ships, it has been extremely satisfactory since last year. However, the stronger the war power is enhanced, the more important ships become. Therefore, shipbuilding work is progressing day by day not only in Japan but also in various occupied areas in the South Seas.</p>
<p>In the past, there were various reasons why it could not be implemented, but now it is all being implemented. Occupational conversions and various industries are now being reorganized so that they can all participate in enhancing war power. This current situation indicates that the Japanese people are truly in a state of war. The enemy, the United States, has already reached the limit in terms of both livelihood and labor. We are also rising up from now on and marching towards the path of victory. Today, when the timing of heaven, the advantages of terrain, and the harmony of people are all in our favor, we will surely achieve victory.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese navy now has the productive power that is being fully utilized, as well as the quantity, technology, and spirit it possessed in the past. Moreover, it has a plan to attack the enemy and will follow the strategy to make the enemy fall into our strategy. At the same time, the enemy is taking the opportunity to occupy various islands, giving us the opportunity to completely crush them. The attitude of the officers and soldiers of our Combined Fleet will be praised by historians in later generations.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Current Situation on the Mainland Battlefield <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River on April 18, the Chinese front has become a major battlefield for decisive battles. In the approximately three months since then, the development of the battle situation has been increasing day by day. At first, the flames of war seemed to extend to the fertile fields of Henan, and the Japanese army had a great momentum to rush into the Guanzhong Basin. Unexpectedly, flames of war rose again on the Hunan Plain, and the Japanese army quickly occupied Changsha, attacked the Hengyang Airport, secured two major strongholds, and attacked Quzhou in Zhejiang. The Japanese army in South China also went north along the Yuehan Line. Currently, the First, Ninth, and Seventh Third War Zones all have fierce wars, and the length of the front line has reached 2,350 kilometers, which is the largest operation since the Sino-Japanese Incident. The purpose of this military operation by the Japanese army, as stated in the Japanese government's statement on July 5, is mainly to "destroy the Anglo-American attempt to make an invasion."</p>
<p>The Japanese army's new operations in the past three months have rapidly unfolded through four stages. The Japanese army first launched an offensive from the bank of the Yellow River in North China. After capturing Linzhou and Xuchang, they opened the Jinghan Line on January 9. On the 25th, they captured Luoyang, the largest stronghold in the First War Zone. The Japanese army's vanguard advanced to near Tongguan. This was the first stage of the operation.</p>
<p>On May 27, the Japanese army's new elite troops suddenly moved in Dongting Lake in Jiangnan. By June 18, they captured the important town of Changsha. On the 26th of the same month, they also captured the major base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the Hengyang Airport. The battle is still ongoing. The Hunan operation, with the capture of Changsha and Hengyang Airport as the two major points, is the second stage.</p>
<p>As for the third stage of the Japanese army's operation, it is the Quzhou capture; the fourth stage is the Japanese army in South China going north along the Yuehan Line. (Translated from the Asahi Jitsuho, July 19)</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Regret of Feet <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Shufang</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The only regret in Boss Zhao's life was that his wife had small feet. Now that Mrs. Zhao has passed away, Boss Zhao has mended his ways and is wholeheartedly doing business. Whenever he mentions his wife, he always sighs and says, "Yu Ping! Everything about her was good, except for her small feet. Alas! A pair of small feet."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago, Boss Zhao was still a young man. Zhao Kangnian was working as a clerk in a cloth store, supporting himself and his mother with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. At that time, Boss Zhao was already eighteen years old and had not yet taken a wife. On the one hand, it was because the Zhao family had no money, and on the other hand, Zhao Kangnian had high standards. He had considered many potential matches, but none had been successful.</p>
<p>That year, Zhao Kangnian's aunt also came to propose a marriage for him. The girl's surname was Shen. Her father and grandfather had both been officials in the Qing Dynasty. Her grandfather was even a Hanlin scholar of the former Qing Dynasty, but her father had passed away early, leaving behind an only daughter, Miss Yu Ping. The family still had some money, but they were also in a situation where they could not find a suitable match above or below their station. She was twenty-eight years old and had not yet married. Unfortunately, Miss Yu Ping had her feet bound in her childhood because her father insisted that his daughter must have bound feet. So, her feet were still a pair of three-inch golden lotuses. However, after the Republic of China, women's feet were liberated, and Western customs gradually spread to the East. Fashionable young ladies and wives had already permed their hair and wore high heels. As for the beauty of "lotus blossoms," that kind of foot beauty had been eliminated. Helplessly, Mrs. Shen lowered the conditions for choosing a son-in-law. Wealth was not important, as long as he had a clean background and was reliable. After the details were explained, Mrs. Zhao did not object. It was said that Miss Yu Ping was very pretty and had a rich dowry. Mrs. Zhao knew that her son would not object either. The most difficult point was the small feet issue. Both Mrs. Zhao and the aunt had small feet and did not feel negatively about them. Moreover, they still found the natural feet of ordinary women somewhat displeasing. After their discussion, they felt that this marriage with a good dowry could not be missed. They only needed to hide the small feet issue from Kangnian. Once they were married, what's done is done, and there wouldn't be any major problems.</p>
<p>When Zhao Kangnian learned about this, he was very angry and asked the woman's family for a photo to look at. Miss Yu Ping was indeed good-looking. He then agreed to this matter with a very satisfied feeling. The day before the wedding, the Shen family's dowry was sent over. Because they were descendants of officials, the dowry was very rich and exquisite, with a bit of antique charm. Relatives and friends all praised Zhao Kangnian's good fortune. Zhao Kangnian and his mother were, needless to say, very pleased.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was a mix of old and new customs, and it was very lively. When the guests discovered that the bride's walking posture was a bit special, they began to whisper among themselves. Finally, when they realized that the bride had small feet, everyone had the same thought:</p>
<p>Oh, no wonder a high-ranking official's daughter would marry into a poor family!</p>
<p>Kangnian was the groom and was too busy to notice the bride, nor did he want to hastily look closely at the bride, but he noticed the strange looks of the guests whispering, and he had some doubts. He wondered if the bride had some shortcoming. He waited until after the wedding dinner, and then he went into the bridal chamber to carefully look at the bride. She still had a beautiful face, a slender figure, and a shy posture. Kangnian slowly noticed her feet. Ah! A pair of small feet! Kangnian felt like someone had hit him hard on the head. He was so angry that he immediately turned around and went out, hiding alone in the firewood room in the backyard. He thought he was too careless, only paying attention to her face and not noticing her feet. But he bitterly thought: in this civilized world, who asks about big feet or small feet when marrying a wife! What awful luck! And his aunt, since she was her neighbor, she obviously knew she had small feet, why didn't she tell me earlier! In this day and age, everyone goes out in pairs, how can he take her out? The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and he almost cried out loud.</p>
<p>The guests who had just finished eating were preparing to make a ruckus in the bridal chamber, but they couldn't find the groom. The aunt, after all, was also a relative, and knowing perhaps that Kangnian had already discovered the bride's flaw, she did not make a fuss but secretly looked around, and finally found him in the firewood room. One look at Kangnian's expression and she knew that her guess had been confirmed. She then spoke to him, advising and persuading him: Now that you are married, you are husband and wife, and everyone should be considerate of each other. This small detail is not a major issue. Moreover, a rich dowry has already been acquired. Take this money to do business, get rich, and you can marry as many beautiful, fashionable women as you want. After listening to what the aunt said, Kangnian felt at least somewhat comforted, and he went out again to deal with the guests. The bridal chamber was not disturbed too much. On the one hand, because the aunt said that Kangnian was tired from the whole day and not feeling well, and on the other hand, because the guests saw that the groom was unhappy, they tactfully dispersed one after another.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>After the wedding, Zhao Kangnian's psychology was often in conflict. It could be said that he still liked Yu Ping to some extent because Yu Ping had given him a very good first impression in the photo. Also, Yu Ping served him very carefully and thoughtfully. She did everything before he even asked. This kind of capable and considerate wife would often make a husband who had been single for twenty years feel that there were too many benefits to marriage. Kangnian felt this way, but this kind of goodwill would often be completely erased by Yu Ping's small feet. Kangnian would often lose his temper at Yu Ping over small things. Yu Ping would only lower her head and shed tears, saying nothing. In fact, she had long known that this misfortune was unavoidable. Mrs. Zhao felt that her son's deliberate anger was a bit too much and often helped her daughter-in-law say a few words. As time went on, everyone got used to it.</p>
<p>Two months later, Kangnian told his mother and wife that he couldn't make a name for himself as an employee forever and wanted to open a cloth store with some friends, but he didn't have the capital. Mrs. Zhao looked at her daughter-in-law, and Yu Ping immediately understood. She went into the room and brought out all her jewelry and cash, placing it in front of her husband. The mother-in-law smiled, her eyes squinting with joy, and Kangnian also looked happy. He felt that Yu Ping was a good wife, and with a feeling of pity, he only took half of the offering.</p>
<p>Kangnian's shop opened, and he became the boss. Five years later, the cloth store gradually prospered, and Yu Ping's money and jewelry were almost used up. By this time, they had two children. Kangnian's business grew bigger, and he rarely sat at home for long. Gradually, Kangnian earned a lot of money, but he brought home only a limited amount, mostly for his own enjoyment, and he often didn't come home all night. Mrs. Zhao often scolded him, and Kangnian was still somewhat afraid. Later, when Mrs. Zhao died, Kangnian had no qualms, and Yu Ping suffered even more. She worked hard all day doing housework and raising children. Kangnian's temper became worse and worse, and Yu Ping was always trembling in front of him. Outsiders said that Kangnian was having an affair with a prostitute. Neighbors saw Boss Zhao's attitude towards Yu Ping and felt somewhat unfair, but Yu Ping took it calmly. In fact, who could know the pain in her heart?</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, twelve years had passed. The two children had grown up, and under their mother's strict education, they were very filial and progressive. This was Yu Ping's only comfort. The hard work, worry, and anger of these ten years accumulated into Yu Ping's incurable disease. In her dying moments, she looked fondly at her two children and said to Kangnian that after her death, she hoped he would marry a wife with big feet!</p>
<p>After Yu Ping died, Kangnian also became tired of the romantic life outside. He often thought of the good things Yu Ping had done for him when she was alive and felt ashamed towards his two upright children, feeling that he had not fulfilled his responsibility as a father.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Now everyone knows that Boss Zhao doesn't go out and mess around much anymore, and he loves his two sons very much. He doesn't mention remarrying. Whenever he mentions his wife, he always sadly says:</p>
<p>"Yu Ping! Everything about her was good, alas! Except for her small feet!"</p>
<h3 id="e32">Sorrow and White Hair <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Yaoqing</p>
<p>Can sorrow immediately turn a person's hair white? Let me first cite a few examples:</p>
<p>On October 14, 1793, Queen Antoinette, the wife of French King Louis XVI, was sent to the guillotine. She was sentenced to death on the day before the execution. Although the judgment and execution were only separated by one night, her hair turned white.</p>
<p>According to Swiss ancient historian Sismondi, there was also a story about sudden whitening of hair. He said that in ancient times, there was a scholar who studied Greek in Constantinople. When he returned to his hometown after completing his studies, he carried two boxes of Greek manuscripts, which were the result of his tireless research. But on the way back, because the ship he was on encountered danger and was broken, one box of manuscripts was lost. That box was the result of much hard work and was invaluable. Once lost, his sadness could be imagined. As a result, overnight, his hair turned white.</p>
<p>Due to intense nerve stimulation, there is another example of a rebellious soldier who unfortunately had his hair turn white. He was arrested and taken to the British authorities. He was formerly in the Bengal army and was interrogated. His military uniform and all his clothes were stripped off, and he was surrounded by other soldiers, naked. He was trembling violently, and his fear and disappointment were deeply expressed on his face. He seemed to have become a fool. When he was actually interrogated, in just half an hour, the black hair on his head turned white. It is said that the interrogator did not notice it at first, but when the interrogating officer suddenly shouted, "How did his hair turn white!" everyone noticed. Among many examples, this one can be said to be the most amazing.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned are all foreign matters. In China, isn't there also a well-known story about hair turning white? That is Wu Zixu passing Zhaoguan. Because he was too worried, afraid of not being able to pass the pass, his hair turned white overnight, the so-called "hair turned white overnight passing Zhaoguan." The gatekeeper couldn't recognize him, so he was able to slip through. This story, when performed in Beijing opera, is divided into "Civil Zhaoguan" and "Military Zhaoguan," but whether "civil" or "military," the actor playing Wu Zixu, when he first appears, always wears a black beard, then sings a section, changing to a black and white beard, and finally changes to a golden white one.</p>
<p>The reason why hair suddenly turns white is often after extreme nerve tension, such as extreme sorrow, or extremely difficult and demanding work. If a person's life is sedentary, this phenomenon is more likely to occur. Therefore, if you do not want your hair to turn white quickly, then apart from the congenital "premature white hair" being unavoidable, please worry less!</p>
<h3 id="e33">Promotion and Assistance <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Everyone has two periods – a learning period and a development period.</p>
<p>In the learning period, we need talent, ambition, family background, and environment; in the development period, we need knowledge, wealth, opportunity, and spirit to build a successful foundation.</p>
<p>But, in fact, it is impossible for everyone to possess such conditions. Then, is "everyone has the hope of success" a meaningless saying? No! Because specific strengths can compensate for other deficiencies. Then, is "failure" a redundant term? No! If we do not try our best to promote these potentially obtainable and utilizable foundational principles, we will definitely not be able to enjoy this kind of assistance, and the result will be failure!</p>
<p>Ah, people who are hesitating! Do you prefer to accept the melancholy argument that "learning is one problem, and the future is another problem!" or the optimistic argument that "when our ambition promotes enthusiasm towards determination; and our ability promotes perseverance towards effort, it is precisely the moment when the assistance we need for success is about to arrive!" (Weihan from Tokyo)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Coming and Going in Haste, Farewell Athletes – Seeing off the Tiyu Team <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Beiping Tiyu basketball team, following the Beixing basketball team, came south in the sweltering heat. In four games in Shanghai, they won three and lost one, earning good reputation. Compared with Beixing's expedition to Shanghai, they had a more satisfactory harvest, and this trip was not in vain. They won the first game in Shanghai against the Shan team with a score of 43 to 34. In the second game, they overwhelmed Mingxing with 45 to 32. In the third game, they showed their true strength and defeated the joint team of the Western team with a score of 24 to 19. In the last game, they tragically fell victim to the Julian team with a score of 33 to 30. Among these four games, the author believes that the game against the Hualian team was the best performance of the Tiyu team. Their northern basketball skills are better than the southern ones, which was fully demonstrated, regardless of the outcome. The author will now analyze the team's various aspects and talk about the team's progress compared to Beixing. Any inappropriate points, I would like to ask for guidance from all circles.</p>
<p>Comparison with Beixing</p>
<p>When Beixing came to Shanghai before, the author pointed out two major shortcomings: narrow ball path and too few ball acquisitions. This time, the Tiyu team has indeed made significant reforms in this regard. Observing their positioning method during the offense, they can always maintain a triangular shape while weaving through the defense. Chang Ying always uses his agility to dodge and can stand in a position where he is confident in shooting. The triangular shape, whether with forwards or guards, changes very quickly, making it very easy for the enemy to be confused. The second is that they deeply understand the importance of gaining possession of the ball. I remember when Beixing came to Shanghai, they rarely followed up on missed shots. This time, Tiyu is different. Whenever the ball is missed, Guo Yongen and Guo Yaojun can use their elasticity to follow up with all their might. Or, after gaining possession of the ball, they pass it out again, so as not to lose possession. The above two points are indeed improvements compared to Beixing.</p>
<p>Next, evaluate their tactics and other aspects:</p>
<p>Fast Offense and Tight Defense are Very Desirable</p>
<p>When attacking, they use their loose style, shooting extremely quickly, which is quite effective in catching the enemy team off guard and unable to return to their formation in time. Their defensive method, based on the probing man-to-man system, is not yet proficient. Therefore, they still use the five-man zone defense method this time. However, within the zone defense, there must be one person in their zone, tightly pressing the enemy player with the ball, not allowing them a moment of free time to use their skills. This kind of defensive technique can indeed compensate for the shortcomings of not being able to use man-to-man defense, and it also makes it difficult for the enemy to develop. Judging from the fact that the Western team and the Hualian team had few methods to score, this is the success of Tiyu's defense.</p>
<p>Lack of Guidance is the Biggest Shortcoming</p>
<p>The previous Beixing team and the current Tiyu team still have this problem. The author really doesn't know why they always lack guidance. Playing ball is indeed a competition between players, but the importance of guidance is no less than that of the competition between players. In European and Western countries, when there are big games, newspapers often use the competition between coaches as a title. From this, it can be seen that the relationship of guidance is truly great and significant. It is regrettable that the Tiyu team does not have a coach, as an expeditionary force, it is a pity to have this shortcoming. Do the Tiyu athletes think so?</p>
<p>Morality is Good but the Desire to Win is Too Strong</p>
<p>The team's morality shows the courtesy of northern athletes. For example, when exchanging players, the players entering the field salute the referee. This kind of respect for the referee is polite, giving the audience an excellent impression and also showing the dignity of the referee. However, the team's desire to win was too strong during the competition this time. If the score fell behind, they would panic and act more roughly. It seemed that they had a mindset of having to win. On the one hand, this is the true color of athletes, and on the other hand, it should be that their psychological training has not yet reached a pure state.</p>
<p>Tiyu came and went in a hurry. In the last issue, the author extended a welcome, and in this issue, I am writing a farewell. In the midst of this haste, the impression they gave me is as described above. Now the Tiyu team has returned north the day before yesterday. Farewell, Tiyu! Work hard for the future, and may you have even more advanced performances in Shanghai during the basketball season in the future, so that you will not have wasted this trip. Also, I heard before that Tiyu also has a women's team. This has made many people here quite concerned. How is the level of the women's basketball team in the north? It is very interesting. I hope that after Tiyu returns to the north, they will state this point in Beiping. When they come again in the future, may both men's and women's teams have north-south exchanges, which is what we hope for even more.</p>
<p>A welcome speech was just given, and a farewell song is already being sung. After writing this, I can't help but feel a sense of loss at the departure of people. Farewell, Tiyu! I wish the entire Tiyu team good health!</p>
<h3 id="e35">Before the Women's Volleyball Final - An Analysis of the Strength of the Green and Three Provinces Teams <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>The volleyball league, the overall situation has been determined, as discussed in the previous issue. The women's group, since Zhi Qian lost to the Green team, and then succumbed to the Three Provinces team, so now it has become a situation where the Green team and the Three Provinces team are competing for supremacy. Zhi Qian's heart has more than enough, but her strength is insufficient, so she has to feel ashamed of herself. She has really let down our expectations at the time. Now the Green team and the Three Provinces team have been scheduled to compete in the final tomorrow (July 7). The author has observed the advantages and disadvantages of the two teams, so I wrote this article, hoping that there will be a new performance in the final, to improve the level of women's volleyball, not just for the sake of the championship, then it will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Organizationally, the Three Provinces Team is Better</p>
<p>According to the Green team's organization, it was originally purely basketball. This time, the sudden organization of a volleyball team is entirely for the love of sports and a kind of attempt. At first, they did not expect to have such a good harvest. The Three Provinces team, on the other hand, is mainly volleyball, and basketball is only auxiliary. So, in terms of organization, the Three Provinces team has at least a year of understanding, while the Green team only has two or three months of history. The difference between them is self-evident. Only the Green team, relying on the natural talent of its players and obtaining the guidance of famous experts, has emerged as a dark horse, making people look at it with new eyes. Now, let's evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the two teams and make predictions.</p>
<p>Talking about the Green Team</p>
<p>The Green team's lineup, whether it is the first, second, or third row, is very balanced, especially the second row is the most standard, which can be called the best among all the women's teams in Shanghai. This is not an exaggeration. Wang Weizhen, who is in the middle, is lively in stature and does not avoid falling, so she can be considered the best in terms of saving the ball. Huang Zhafen is on the right, and Xingfang is experienced, and a powerful hit rarely goes out of bounds, which is definitely not achievable by other candidates. Mingyuan is on the left, able to save and hit, and is a standard talent in the second row. And Wang Yinlan's quick mind and unpredictable changes in the front row, as well as the strength of the generals in the third row, make it a team with an average talent. If they had been organized earlier, the Three Provinces team would definitely not be their opponent. Also, the Green team relies on three people to score, one is Yinlan's diagonal shots and spikes, and the rest are Zhafen and Mingyuan's strong hits. With these three people who can score points, the tactics can be applied well, and often you can get whatever you want, and those who resist will fall.</p>
<p>Talking about the Three Provinces Team</p>
<p>The only person who can score points on the Three Provinces team is Chen Meizhen in the front row. However, Chen's spikes are accurate and powerful, and the shot is fast, making it extremely difficult for the opponent to restrain and save. Therefore, although the Three Provinces team seems to have fewer people who can score points, they have considerable confidence, so they do not let other teams get points. In terms of saving the ball, the Three Provinces team has not yet reached a high level. The quality is uneven, but fortunately, the cooperation has reached a tacit understanding, and there is no fault of contention. So, the Three Provinces team only needs Chen Meizhen to be able to do what she wants, and they can sing a song of victory.</p>
<p>Re-examining the Tactics of the Two Teams</p>
<p>If the Green team wants to win, many people think it is very unlikely. The author does not think so. The Green team can seek changes in tactics, and has a great hope of overwhelming the Three Provinces team. The main point is to first seek how to stop Chen Meizhen's spikes, which is only through blocking. Blocking in a volleyball game is the best way to get points. If they can block Chen Meizhen, they will definitely win. If they can't block it, they should pay attention to the position of the landing point and try their best to save it. If the Green team can do these two points, and then use Yinlan, Xingfen, and Mingyuan's joint attacks. And the third row of the Three Provinces team is weaker, so the Green team can send the attacking balls to the third row more, so that they may not be able to push it to the front row Chen Meizhen. How will the Three Provinces team win? The way for the Three Provinces team to win lies in one heart, how to supply Meizhen? However, in my opinion, Meizhen's stamina is ultimately limited, and it is not a good strategy to have only one attack route. It also makes it difficult to improve the level of other players. Moreover, when the team is practicing, Chen Liuzhen and Shi Dijuan have many powerful hits, so why can't they be used during the game? Therefore, this battle should ask and use them, so as to change the opponent's goal, then their performance will definitely not be limited to the current situation. What does the Three Provinces coach Liu think? Also, the Green team has more attack routes, and the Three Provinces team should also respond accordingly. The attacks of the apricot should be blocked, and for Yinlan's spikes, the second row should pay attention to the landing point quickly, it is useless to block blindly, and it is also possible not to block. When Mingyuan hits, the third row should pay special attention. If the Three Provinces team can do this, they can probably win.</p>
<p>In short, this final will be one of the most exciting moments in this women's volleyball tournament. With the comparable strength of the two teams, the unique insights of the two coaches, and the excitement of the players, there will be a satisfactory process. If you want to predict the odds of winning or losing, each side has half. Will my prediction be fulfilled? The fans should go to the Youth Center tomorrow to watch, and they will know after watching.</p>

It turns out that Yiqin's father unfortunately fell ill and died yesterday morning. The coffin will be sealed at the World Funeral Home at 2:00 p.m. today. Mr. Xie serves in the financial world, is enthusiastic about sports, and has a wide range of social interactions. There will definitely be many people who go to pay their respects today, and a grand farewell can be predicted!</p>
