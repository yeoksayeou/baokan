<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>農村消息</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>帝俄時代的偉大女皇耶卡泰利諾在位時期（一七六二年—一七九六年），行幸高加索時，高加索的地方官吏，為使女皇認為高加索是非常繁榮的，所以凡是女皇所經過的破產農村，都用墨水所塗抹的厚紙，製成美麗壯觀的村落，排列於沿途。職此之故，耶卡泰利諾女皇，就絲毫未曾知道高加索的農民，是整日呻吟於「皇帝喲！我們對於自己的靑菜，是不能不用我們眼淚中的鹽份來調味的」。</p>
<p>目前有很多上海的市民，都像這位女皇耶卡泰利諾一樣，並不知道中國農民在如何生活着。老質說，甚至我道樣佯作一知半解的人，最近接到了無數農村來的消息，因其內容過於悲慘，以致我發生懷疑，眞耶否耶？自從我給申報寫星期論文以來，每天都收到讀者兩三封信，然而對於農村問題，發表了「胸中的苦悶」一文後，讀者的書信，於是更加片片飛來，使我苦於應酬。無論那一封信的字裏行間，都充溢着不被大人先生所注意的中國農村之農民苦痛。其中有一封信如下：</p>
<p>『……最近自靑浦鄕間人民來滬，述及該處正在施行「高度淸鄕」，同時因為去歲米糧，當局未曾收足，故他們在四鄉村莊搜查榖米，甚至有連今年的稻種也全部搜去，一般農民將何以下秧，播種不成，秋收何得？農產無着，民生將何以解決？前途危機，眞不堪設想。又有該縣七灑鄉靑範鄉等處也是因為追收米糧，責成當地鄉鎮保甲長這繳欠糧，然而農民中確也有一繳而再繳，一搜而再拽，連自己的飯米和播種的稻種，已是粒榖無存，巧婦難為無米之炊，將何以報效；保甲長無可交差，聞因之有被處極刑而死於非命者，若是將何以安民心，定民生，振國運，奠國基。農民之苦，可見一般；下有農婦與其丈夫之訴苦信，剪録一段：</p>
<p>「……明日又要我們米糧三石，各石五，我共收八石糙米，前已吃了五斗，祇剩六石五斗，自去年十二月吃起的，家有五六人吃飯，每人半升一天，到現在已吃子三石多了，同時我兒又取去石斗，若再要出一石五斗米糧，所剩一石多米，叫我們母女數人怎樣過活？現在鄕人願每畝解米糧三斗，但定要每畝五斗，現正在請求中，若不能求免，恐怕還要我們解第三次米糧，我這幾天急得六神無主，若將米解光後，叫我們母女幾人怎樣度日呢？我們不解米糧，飯米尙不够……今年共六石多米，還要出米糧。况且從去冬十二月吃起，再加今年閨月，怎樣辦呢？又加明兒心痛，　翁有病，建兒碧兒均患咳嗽，很是利　……妻巧仙手白」</p>
<p>看了這一封農婦訴苦的信，我們就可知道農民中一般的困境苦情，還有許多有淚哭不出，有苦說不出。但此種情形，造成的因子，當然很複雜；像去年這樣惟利自國的糧食部長顧實衡領導之下，蘇省處於后胡一流賣汚的治理之下，上行下效，浮收，虛報，尅扣，走私，種種舞弊，層出不窮，農民的苦痛焉得不深，實皆由於政績不良，而釀成今日不堪收拾的局面。雖則農民亦有聯絡鄉鎮地痞污吏，通同舞弊；然而一般安分農民，早已奉命應繳，所受到的重徵榨壓之苦，怨沉海底，有誰再願耕種？造成此種患害全民的遺憾，其影響人民對和平之信仰，對盟邦提携之直覽，將何以補之。是則拯救農民為目前最重要之任務，急盼中日當局雙方提出嚴重注意，尤其在今舉行高度淸鄉時期，如果督導不嚴，再蹈覆撤，將何以得民心！」還有一位讀者，曾告訴我一個令人髮指，悲慘痛絕的事實。</p>
<p>「最近竞兄有發生了一件慘案，地點在蘇滬之間，錄述如下：</p>
<p>某農民一家四口，二大二小，夫婦兩人藉薄田數畝，每年收入，聊足糊口，去年以蘇有辦糧食之不良，因之今年春季又追繳米糧，該處由保長徵收，上峯收米款，亦付與保長代辦，故又稱之曰「保甲米」，而該農民已在去年繳淸保甲米，今保甲文威迫重徵，奈彼家實貧困，連食米無存，無法應繳，懦弱無知農民，何堪威脅，不得已而變買妻子，將所得之款繳付。不料時隔未久，又來徵收，在「嚴政猛於虎」之下，保長之命不得抗違，怨恨無訴，乃殺其二子，以免日後受苦，自己懸標自殉，此兇耗為乃妻所聞，悲從中來，亦自殉而死。其後夫（賣他妻子的人）目睹此種慘景，內心悲憤交加，以為不應買其妻，而造成此孽怨，良心不安，咎歸於己，乃亦自殺。嗚呼！此五口無辜良民，悮死於保甲長之手，農民焉願再事耕種乎？</p>
<p>這段慘案您聽了作何感想？目下鄕間保甲長之盛威，仗了軍　之勢欺壓良民，實不勝枚舉。」</p>
<p>即讀過這兩封信的人，也一定會知道，目前中國農村如何被窮凶極惡所統治着。五月十六日的申報社評「論縣政」，其開宗明義第一句就說：「中央政治是點，省區政治是綫，縣區政治是面」，這在經濟方面來說。「點」和「綫」，是完全由「面」來培植的。事實上，上海和南京的全部人口，無論怎樣喧囂吶喊，也不能生產出一粒五穀來。而這所有的人，全都仰賴於散在於一面」的農民之生產物。試觀目前的情形，無論怎樣認為公平，也不能說點與綫對農民有對等供給（工業生產品）。上海與南京的市民既對農民無大供獻，然而在衣食住行上，却是農民所不能望其項背的。</p>
<p>我認為中國的病癥就在於此。農村旣處於這樣惡劣的形勢裹，所以農民在徘徊於岐途，而不積極參加和平區的政治生活。中國政治如無農民參加，望成功是徒然的。孫總理是最知道中國農民在政治上的比量的，他下列的話，足可證明我言之不要，同時我相信，他下列的話裹，曾指出中國應走的方向。</p>
<p>「首先便要一般農民知道，對於國家有竹麼責任，農民所仰望於國家的有什麼利益……如果農民不來參加革命，就是我們革命沒有基礎……要加人農民運動，就是要用農民來做基礎，要農民來做本黨的革命基礎……如果這種基礎不能鞏固，我們革命要失敗」（耕者有其田），（魯譯）</p>

<h3>盟邦日本海軍紀念節特輯　日本海海戰　觀戰日記</h3>
<p>擊滅英美的决戰下的第三十九屆海軍紀念日，轉瞬又快來臨了。我們不禁又想起旗艦三笠號，高揭着Z　，擊滅帝俄波羅的海艦隊時的情景。在離大戰海上二里多地方的島上，故宗像繁丸主典，與佐勝市五郎者，寫了一篇日誌、詳記當時所目覩的海軍奮戰情形。這日誌現在永久保存在官幣大社宗像神社。茲迻譯轉載於此，撫今追昔，當能一新擊滅英美的决心。</p>
<p>明治三十八年九月二十七日西風强，曇大，多霧</p>
<p>一，本日上午七時四十分左右，接得望樓報告，獲悉敵艦隊有通過東水道模樣，須加注意之急電。正午起，本島西北，砲聲隆隆可聞。下午一時左右，接獲通知，有不見我艦隊之電。乃一司疑集視綫，向海上警戒中。二時十分左右起，砲聲似愈迫近，但注視西方，因本日霧重，海上五海里之外，渺無所見，瞭望着頗感困難。二時半，西南四海里地點，有軍艦一艘出現，前後左右受砲火包圍，奮力應戰，正陷於苦戰中。因距離頗遠，無從獲悉其為敵艦抑我艦，惟定睛細看時，不料乃係我眾艦受敵艦砲擊，且戰且退。不久，敵艦隊計十八艘，水雷艦驅逐艦合計五六艘，突出現於四海里之地點。陣形不整，艦隊中縱有水雷艦，驅迤監，向西化進行。余等均怒不可遏，但無能為力，望樓立即急電各地，此時，人皆注視敵之動靜，二時四十分，忽見軍艦四艘出現於西南。余等頗以為是敵艦之後續部隊，不禁深為恐慌，凝視之，喜不自勝，蓋係吾艦千代田，當磐，八雲，磐手四艦索敵追　而至。立即開始砲擊，殷殷砲聲有增無已，有如天崩地裂，硝烟　　，掩蔽海面，火光閃閃，海神為之驚覺。加以狂風怒濤，吹襲海上，朝來為薄霧籠置之海上情景，愈增陰慘，極凄壯之感。午後三時我艦壓迫敵方，敵艦轉向欲圖逃週吾加以攔截。此時，遠方海上，有我艦隊主力五十餘　出現，截斷退路，包圍攻擊，敵隊形愈形混亂，苦戰求遁，我艦且追且向西北進航。至下午四時，敵隊伍支離滅裂，分頭圖逃。此時有三處發生海戰，戰鬥艦互相捉對交戰，驅逐艦巡洋艦亦各列陣互輸，敵艦有二艦起火，其一高播折斷，機艙受損，發生傾斜，支持苦撑，我艦（似為磐手）亦有受損者，暫離隊退至後方修理，瞬又加入戰列，五時左右起，成為近擊戰，以離本島漸遠，且天色已晚，不能再有所見。下午八時左右，由電話獲悉有敵艦三艘向西南進行，今黑暗不能見，惟有賴探海燈警戒。水夫佐薩松之助立即登高瞭望，在　瀨對面東方，見有白色電燈。即報告望樓。此艦似逃出一卅海方位者。砲聲終夜隱隱不絕，衆皆澈宵不眠，等待後報，以至天明。</p>
<p>五月二十八日</p>
<p>一，本日天氣睛和，可遠望海上苟易本日為昨日，既便海戰，亦使觀戰。據情報，本日在朝鮮松島附近，彼我大激戰中。十時，接電悉敵艦至少擊沉四艘，砲聲仍　聞殷殷不絕。午後三時，扶桑，　紫，高尾三艦通過西北</p>
<p>五月二十九日</p>
<p>一，本日上午十時，磐手，八雲一艦在本島東南八海里地點通過。在未判悉者，頗以為係敵艦，非常騷動。迨判悉後　以獲聞我軍大勝之報，一同三呼萬歲。（翔：譯自五月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日海軍發祥地　南伊豫巡禮</h3>
<p>— 米山保</p>
<p>兩碗環抱詩的瀨戶內海及黑　（註一）狂嘯的太平洋的伊豫的山河，恰與愛媛（註二）之名相當，宛如凜然的日本女性。尤其是三方臨海的南伊豫，西挟盟豫海峽，模糊與監後，日向二國相對，北隔伊豫灘而望周防，南面則為波濤起伏渺茫無垠的太平洋。這是椰子等熱帶植物繁茂的南方溫暖之地，橘花馥郁，夏橙滿枝，乃是日木民族祖先從南渡海而來所定居的武勝桃源。在知道八幡船（註三）的歷史以前，南伊豫之土的歷史，即和日本民族史的第一頁同時展開。而對於由南人的血統，瀨戶之海及黑潮所生的豪宕雄大而纖麗的南豫人的傳統，更須理解。然而，為求海之歷史而蒞此地的筆者，對於山河之美，蒼空之明，史蹟之鑒，不覺茫然。既有南風不競的興國年間高舉勤皇義旗之鄉，也有武人爭霸的古戰塲及海賊藤原純友所據的血的孤島。島嶼，河川，山嶺，悉屬史上遺跡。山河雖然默默無言，但切切相迫的懷古的感傷，對於旅人實為難以替代的美餐。</p>
<p>海賊與潛水船</p>
<p>吉井勇有詠日振島之專的歌句：濃眉大目的海賊臉喲，不要忘掉日振之夏。</p>
<p>日振是一個小島，和宇和島相望，是豐豫海峽的眼目。此島一帶，無異是詩趣盎然的海的公園，但在天慶年間，却是海鷹藤原純友的根據地，而在元龜元正的爭覇時代，則是海戰大舞臺的古戰塲。純友佔據此島後，即率南伊豫的海賊四千名，兵船一千艘而起，風糜了西海。在日振島高聳的小丘上，有勞的遣跡。那裹堅着生於南豫的昭和的海運王山下龜三郎氏所建御影石的大碑。想當年這個梟雄曾　滿腹雄圖而凝望着南豫的海空吧。碑上勒着「海賊藤原純友寵居之地」幾個大字，筆力雄勁。據說山下氏寫此碑之時曾添註「海賊山下龜三郎建之」一句，曾使其左右尤感困惑云。純友精練的水軍，其戰術及航海術在當時稱為舉世無雙，橫行瀨戶內海一帶，無人敢攖其鋒。天慶四年藤原忠之任征夷大將軍正下時，奉命掃蕩純友水軍的東豫海賊河野氏等的水軍，在內海各地演出拚死的機動戰，窮追純友軍，終於在太宰府的海戰高奏最後的凱歌。此役中，河野氏等官方水軍用着精良的新兵器，就是舟底有三個乃至八個洞的小型兵船，船的甲板上有通氣用的筒，在决戰之際，打開船底的洞穴，放人適量的海水，使船體十分之七沉得海面下，如此奇襲敵軍，接近敵舟時，突然掀起甲板，或一擁而上敵船，或放矢猛射。總之，這種小型的舟艇可說是今日海戰要具潛水艇的先祖。伊豫的水軍在千年以前竟已知道運用這樣的新職術了。</p>
<p>伊豫和八幡船</p>
<p>海岸綫延長三百十里，分住於二百餘個島嶼上的日本民族光祖，一邊拓土，一邊浪跡海上，其氣以至中國四百餘州，更越重洋而抵椰林茂密的南洋名的倭寇，亦係南豫的人們所首創。南方各種族為了渡越海洋而作的鏗節型的刳船，其藍本便是征服了潮流氣候隨日人足跡所到而發達起來的伊豫人的八轓船。八轓船上的水手，雖集日本各地的勇健者而成，但其指揮官常為伊豫的　族。</p>
<p>豐臣秀吉於天正十六年頒布海賊禁止令後，海賊之流雖紛紛改行，但生長海上而意氣　邁的南豫人，仍悄悄守着伊豫水軍的傳統。八幡濱市一名的起源，據傳也在於八幡船。該市三方為山環抱，僅西方面海。然今日已是熱鬧的港市，在其粗邁的氣息中，可以想出往古的風貌。（未究）（吉譯自週刋朝日一千二百十九號）</p>
<p>註一：黑潮為海流之一種，沿日本列島的近海而，為暖流。其水帶藍黑色，故名。</p>
<p>註二：愛媛亦作愛比賣，為將伊豫國神格化之名。</p>
<p>註三：八幡船為日本室町冪府末世一部分關西將土駕以出海之船，因揭「八幡菩薩」之旗，故一名。</p>

<h3>陳市長日公使發表　節約電力談話　暑期電燈節約運動今日開始</h3>
<p>電力爲工業生產之原動力，尤以戰時工業生產，需要電力益形增大，一般用電自應加以節約，以期確保工業生產力量，貢獻於大東亞戰爭之完遂。華中水電公司爲喚起市民之協力，自本月起三們月內，推行「暑期電燈節約運動」，上海特別市政府陳市長及日大使館上海事務所宇佐美公使，特分別發表談話如次：</p>
<p>陳市長發表談話</p>
<p>戰時物資供應，本不能如平時充裕，在戰爭期中，一切日用所盡，無不力求節省，尤以電力一項，旣因煤炭運輸不便，產量減少，而在工業生產部門，需要轉大，故電力之節約，尤不可不刻意請朮。本市用電，自去年十二月以來，早經限制，雖曾獲相當成效，然在戰爭持續中，爲確保工業生產之必需，及維持其他用電之恒久計，仍有强調節約之必要。此次華中水電公司，推行暑期電燈節約運動，旨在喚起市民充分利用日光，節省燈光，即以節約所得，用於增加生產，在一般用戶，旣不感若何困難，而在工業生產方面，獲益甚大，實可謂極有意義之舉措，凡我市民務宜深體斯旨，努力實行。當茲夏季，日　方長，能日出而作，旣昏便息，正可藉節省燈光一事，嚴肅生活，增進健康，便利防空，裨益生產，所謂爲己爲人，一舉兩得。倘有玩忽之徒，耗損公用，不知自檢，一經察覺，當不免停止供應，目貽伊戚。至電力公司方而，對於電量之調度增減，亦應嚴格調査，合理分配，務使必需者，不致匱乏，虛讀者不任枉縱，彼此協力以安定民生，增強戰力，有厚望孺。</p>
<p>宇佐美公使談話</p>
<p>電力對遂行戰爭上，所佔地位之重要，已爲任何人所熟知，無庸贅言，但目前之節電，其重要性不亞于節約汽油，尤其於上海，其電力來源，純山於火力發電，而火力發電之燃料，又賴於煤觔，然煤　與運煤之運輸機關，均與戰力具有密切之關係，加之目下對供給軍需及生活必需品等生產部份之電力，益有確保之必要，故不但不可　費電力，即使必要之電力，亦必須先傳向至重要方面，因此不論一度之電力，亦須盡量節約。山於以上之原因，自去年十一月以來，即實施調監電力之消費，而此次復以季節而觀，認爲目下爲最容易實施節電時期，故先實施節約電燈用之電力，以適應時局之需要。即自本日起實施「電燈節約遝動」，以三月爲期，至此次節約之目標，雖爲電燈，然各工廠方面對動力上及其他用途所使用之電力，亦應特別加以節約，此誠爲當務之急，即各家庭及各機關，不但對電燈且對其他用途所耗費之電力，亦應設法盡量加以節省，俾有所貢獻於大東亞戰爭之勝利，以期萬無遺憾。至於節約方法，可向電力公司商談，如各用戶對節約電力有妙案時，亦可盡量發表。例如在夏令期間中，將夜間之事改於早晨辦埋，或減少晚間娛樂，此不僅對刷新日常生活裨益非淺，且可節省電力，誠爲一舉兩得之事。望能節約一秒鐘之電力，正如一滴之血，吾人深望利用貴重之電力，而行不正當娛樂者猛省。又節省電力與戰時燈火管制之趣旨，亦相配合，故對電泡光度之大小，及電燈數，亦望加以考慮節省。又關於實施此次節約運動之際，决不變更以往所規定之用戶限制量，而純爲希望各用戶出於自動及誠意，深望予以協力。另一方面將派調査班實施査察，凡遇無誠意合作者，當予以適當之處罰。至當局方面，爲謀電力之消費公正合理起見，今後當更進一步努力，至各用戶亦須充分理解節電之意義，不斷協力，不勝切望之至。</p>

<h3>陳友仁先生傳略　本報資料室</h3>
<p>陳友仁先生，廣東順德縣人。生於民國紀元前三十七年（一八七五），現年六十九歲。太夫人現尙健在，年九十餘歲。先生之父及母舅均曾任職於太平天國，迨太平天團失敗，遂出亡至大西洋之千里達島。先生早歲留學英國，習法律，先後在千里達及倫敦執行律師職務。辛亥革命起，先生即棄所業，自倫敦經莫斯科歸園，任交通部法律顧問。旋膺英文北京日報及英文京報之聘，主持筆政，鼓吹反袁帝制，被拘禁。釋出後，往上海瓶辦英文滬報。第一次歐戰吿終，先生被派爲南方政府出席巴黎和會非正式代表。民十一年，孫中山先生開府廣州，聘先生爲外交顧問兼航空局長，後中山先生北上，先生隨行。中山先生逝世後，先生居北京，剏辦英文民報，以反對軍閥，再被拘禁。民十五年，還粤任中央政洽會議委員兼外交部長，主持北伐時期中之革命外交，其問會收復漢口九汀各地租界。民十六年，寗漢分裂，先生偕孫夫人赴歐旅居。民二十年，廣州開府，先生復任外交部長。民二十三年，再度赴歐，旅居數年。民二十七年，由歐歸國，旅居香港。民三十年冬，大東亞戰爭爆發，日軍攻占香港，翌年四月，來上海，是年七月，發表對時局論文，希望日本眞誠改變對華政策，促成全面和平，而對國人，備致鼓勵。</p>
<p>最近兩年，先生居滬，深居簡出，與外間頗鮮接觸，專心致力於「戰後世界問題之解决」的硏究。惜乎此書尙未脫稿，以心臟病於五月廿日上午三時零五分溘然長逝。遣囑火焚遺體，不葬地，不樹碑，而以遺灰散之大洋，還諸太虛。將於五月二十二日下午三時在靜安寺公墓內禮堂舉行節單儀式。夫人秉承先生遺囑對於花圈輓聯，均予懇辭。</p>
<p>先生雖以鐵腕外交家見稱於世，但其待人接吻，均極謙和，爲朋儕所敬愛。先生爲新聞界前輩，公正敢言思想深刻，每有見解頗多獨到之處。對於處事論斷，能兼籌全局。而意志之堅定，治事之剛毅，尤爲先生性格之特點，人人精於藝術，先生則愛好藝術，提倡藝術，不遺餘力也。</p>
<p>陳友仁先生遺像</p>
<h3>陳友仁先生的臨終記</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>我剛剛看完陳友仁先生的臨終，而返歸家來。先生於今日（五月二十日）上午三點五分，在最愛的夫人和極近的兩三位朋友之看護下，在自已家裏，安靜地，淸醒地，壽終正　了。兩個月前，肝贓內因有結核菌，受醫師囑，需要絕對靜養，然而先生總不聽，竟在床上，無時無動不在思慮中國的命遝，和亞洲的命運，凡運想到一件事，必用口頭叙述出來，命令夫人筆之於書。我認爲，先生因爲早已預知死之將至，所以才想把最後賜與國民的著述，早日完成下來。兩星期前會面時，先生尙精神飽滿，而在床上曾說過，在這樣緊張的局勢下，中國的前途和亞洲的前途，尙渺茫無期，這是命中注定的事。特別銳利的自光，射向着天花板，而重複了兩次命中注定，命中注定。從那時起，先生的神經就異常興奪起來了。昨天我有一位朋友曾拜訪過先生，說先生在昨天和今天非常興奮，而病體業已臨近危險期了，所以我聽到這樣話，就打算明天去問病。突然接到電話，說先生的病體急轉直下，極度嚴重。在一時半左右，忽忙趕到先生的住宅，但當時先生業已陷於昏迷狀態，面孔上，籠罩着濃厚的死的顏色。夫人坐在床頭，頻頻用手摩擦先生的頸，然而先生只是急於呼息，而在朦朧地睡着。很明顯可以看出來，氣息在不斷地稀薄起來。夫人在眼框裘，滿滿地盛着淚珠，表現著以東方人的忍耐，在抑制著精神上的無限痛苦。我們看著臨終者的痛苦，以及留在人問者的痛苦，委實忍受不住了，於是一時便走到隔壁的屋子裏去，非常寂靜，萬籟無聲。這樣靜的夜，絕想不到這就是上海的夜。「巾國的智星」，將與人寰永久別離了，我認爲應當是一個喧囂的夜，才能相襯。此時，夫人在靜靜地招呼着先生，「親愛的，親愛的」的聲音，從郵差室傳過來。明知上天是聽不見的，而仍在像對某人哭訴般，發着悲哀的聲音。外面，毫無任何聲音。在窗外，只有將近天亮的窮　中，有一棵不知各的大屋在熒熒熌爍着。突然鄰室的門開了，而護士說：「請終正寢了」。我們急忙進去一看，先生的呼息，業已若斷若續了。然而面孔，却比方才還鎭靜了。這正像結束最後鬥爭的戰士一般的一副鎭靜面孔。這位偉大的戰士，曾把整們的生命都獻於國家的的事業上，而其肉體，現在將要在此休息了。（記於五月二十日上午六時）魯譯</p>

<p>先生及見夫太平？斯常理之莫測，而吾道之痛心，忿老成兮長謝，徒想象其典型。袖維　先生豐裁峻整，襟度端凝，愛人以德，律己以誠，吹笙鹿野，奉袂龍門，通經致用，學故知新，慨國家之多難，祠教育之風聲。江漢朝宗，學派訖三吳而外，山林算路，師承起百世之興。洎乎中年，共和肇始，生言起行，長民補世，滌瑕蔼樴，勵精圖治，建官懷知人之哲，正德盡厚生之利，更以全力，攎其初志，庠序盈門，蓄莪造士，大江南北，整興學之宏規，聲教東西，企大同之盛郅。雖觀成未逮桑拿年，而大用已微小試，惟此教育，永矢弗諼。教育集會全省，法團策進學術，恢宏講壇，進德修業，探本窮原，導先路於當塗，功在弼教，立今世以爲楷，人共尊朝，堂堂十載，犖犖萬端，任誰毀與脽譽，祇理得而心安。旋長鴻英，總持館政，萬象包羅，百城管領。禮樂兵農政教號令，若網在綱，有條不紊，示後學之津梁，儲將來之史乘。心營目注，豈龜勉而告勞，日邁月征，縱迷陽而弗病。蓋　先生視公事如家事，引大任爲己任，乃盡瘁以畢生，竟老終而受正。鳴呼！國步艱難，神州俶擾，霧塞天閣，腥聞海島，先生悲天閔人，憂時抱道，愛國中熱，托詩歌以寫懷，望洽情殷，感鬼袖於微妙。崢　歲月，覺來日之方長，鬰勃肺肝，忘大年之旣老。何圖偏櫻磋跌，遽窮護療，道山長往，少徵潛躍。問今是何世，可憐八表同昏，嗟不如無生，早脫三塗惡道。此日一靈不味，排閫圖而上昇，將來九州攸同，聽家庭之祭告。同人等或交有道，或叶周親，或參共濟，或荷裁成，痛氣類之漸孤，悲思何極，恨人天之永隔，風義猶存，公道未巳，兩字上榮哀之謚，遺容如在，桑倫街仰止之忱。載潔淸奠，肅奉明禋，百歲有歸，已沒甯而生順，九京可作，惟明德之香馨。尚饗。</p>

<h3>追念　信老</h3>
<p>— 買豐臻</p>
<p>四月五日晟，忽見申聞霹靂然，上星期獲聞鴻英館員談及　信老近尚健康，何圖一別千古！憶去秋曾階規亮俶畬士劇諸先生與　信老在館集會，幷拍一照，今竟成永訣耶！在滬同人促臻爲　價老作傳，臻何人斯，敢效十瞻爲退之撰碑文耶！矧　信老於四年前亦曾自撰無成人傳，復卷可得也。惟念四十年來臻與　信老曾同辦敎育市政慈善等事業，交誼匪淺，詎可默爾而息，因略述所知以追念之，未敢云傳也。信老爲　發山堂姨父之弟，與臻爲父輩行，是以臻作書函時，稱　信老爲姻丈或姻世叔，目稱爲姻世姪，而信老往往稱臻爲先生，其謙恭下士有如此者。</p>
<p>信老壯强時，頗自高崖岸，後生小子望而生撲，往往退有後言，獨臻弱冠前會與交接，蒙醫正楷摺扇，殊不易得，（所書係目撰吾園詩，有舊種垂楊少，新寒減夕陽，不堪虫螘蝕，况有斧斤傷句，吾園爲龍門舊址，詩句竟成後日龍門之戡）其汲引後進有如此者。光廿九年春，臻興已友楊月如君提倡新教育，辦二十二鋪小學，翠年春後辦師範講習所，款紃勢孤，不絕如縷，是時，信老適長寶山縣學堂，聞空谷足音見然而喜，其次臻等率小學生一，遠足寶山吳淞等處，承倍老致歡迎辭，慰勉有加，並留午餐，實開吾輩教育上之新紀元，其聳應氣求有如此者。</p>
<p>是時掌教龍門書院者爲湯开庵師，月試輙以時務命題臻得受知焉，其次課題爲擬改能門書院爲師範學堂，臻等暢所欲言，因以决定，由信老等赴日本考察教育，信老歸任師範監督，即延同人籌備一切，越三月開學，又越三月派臻與袁君俶畲赴日專習教育，以爲後日儲才計，其興學育才有如此者。</p>
<p>蘇浙路商辦，嚮者四應，教育界發起人爲信老，號召師生，集腋成袋，雖後來結果甚微，然然誠可惑，其急公仗義有如此者。</p>
<p>項城稱帝前，某省教育會致電蘇省教育會請列各請願，信老擬不覆，臻誚彼萬一作我默認如何，不如引用教育會規程，不得干涉教育以外事爲辭，即决定照覆，後段氏執政，對於加入歐戰未决，信老同情於科學最發達之國，適新會梁氏來會微求意見，同人以吾國與協約國關係較深爲辭，於是信老亦憣然改正，其舍已從人有如此者。</p>
<p>五四事夑，上海罷學罷市，延長旬餘，盧護車使約各團體會商，信老與臻亦列席，忽徐警廳長大肆咆哮，謂此事只須用强權武力，已足壓服，信老大怒，謂護軍使欲採各方意旨，警廳長竟敢在長宮前口出大言，無理取鬧，請即懲戒，是時會塲聲勢洶洶，獨軍使非常鎮定，僅謂如政府從民意罷曹陸章職，則罷學罷市可結束否，眾曰可，於是一塲風渡平靜，信老亦息怒，其不畏强禦有如此者。</p>
<p>信老駐會辦事時，最努力於各演講會，如社會教育講演會，則由余君日章主之，說文講演會，則信老自主之學術講演會時影響不少，其不厭不倦有如此者。</p>
<p>信老曾爲中國圖書公司總編輯，當時選任之各編輯，大都爲知各之士，且其中有學校方始業者，其虚心好士有如此者。</p>
<p>信老辦事非常專一，故任圖書公司總編輯，即辭去監督職務，繼任省教育會駐會辦事，即辭去總褊輯職務，幷反對一面辦學一面應試者，臻與衰君不應學部留學生考試，即其一例，其專心致志有如此者。</p>
<p>宣統三年春，省教育會聯合會開於上海，信老爲主席，注重軍國居敎育案及廢止小學置經案，夏學部開中央教育會於北京，信老亦爲會員之一，以上兩案又經多方辯論，賴以成立，其智創巧述有加此者。</p>
<p>辛亥革命成功，倍老爲吾蘇民政副長，當時各縣縣長尚稱得人，信老與有力焉，逮二年夏贛寗事變起，程應下野，信老亦辭職，仍任省教育會駐會辦事，直至十六年國民軍欲打倒軍閥，始辭去，其用行舍藏有如此者。</p>
<p>世界大戰以來，信老主張欲世界大同當自融和五教始，因發起融五講經社臻曾一度講儒釋道相同之點，以四子吳靜道德經·南華經·金剛經·彌陀經心經爲本，以爲述而不作信而好古，庶不至鄰於武斷，信老頗然之，故其講孔子學說，不以儒限，亦以四子五經，南華經爲本，其强識便敏有如此者</p>
<p>信老近年最喜作詩，數日不見，積詩盈案，比之少陵詩史畏吉錦囊亦不爲過，其不廢吟詠有如此者。</p>
<p>信老晚年病類中風，耳聾舌强，不良於行，然彼仍自告奮勇，危不欲特，顛不欲扶，不知老之將至也，最難得者，去年八十大慶前曾力疾書對聯及摺扇若干，以助館毅，其老常益壯，有如此者。</p>
<p>以上所述，不免拉排，恐未足狀信老於萬一也。</p>

        <h1>1944.05.21</h1>
<h3>Rural News</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>During the reign of the great Empress Catherine of the Russian Empire (1762-1796), when she visited the Caucasus, local officials, wanting the Empress to believe that the Caucasus was very prosperous, used thick paper coated with ink to create beautiful and magnificent villages along the way, masking the bankrupt farming villages that the Empress would pass. Because of this, Empress Catherine never knew that the farmers of the Caucasus were groaning, saying, "Oh, Emperor! We cannot flavor our own vegetables without the salt of our tears."</p>
<p>Currently, many Shanghai citizens are like Empress Catherine, unaware of how Chinese farmers are living. I, Lao Zhi, even as someone who pretends to know a little, have recently received countless messages from rural areas. Their contents are so tragic that I doubt their truth. Since I started writing weekly essays for the Shen Bao, I have received two or three letters from readers every day. However, after publishing the article "Distress in My Heart" about rural issues, the number of letters from readers has increased dramatically, making it difficult to respond to them all. Every letter is filled with the suffering of Chinese farmers in rural areas, which is ignored by the authorities and the gentry. One of the letters reads as follows:</p>
<p>"...Recently, people from the countryside of Qingpu came to Shanghai and reported that 'High Intensity Pacification' is being implemented there. At the same time, because the authorities did not collect enough grain last year, they are searching for grain in the villages, even taking away all the rice seeds for this year's planting. How will the farmers plant? If they cannot plant, how will they harvest in the autumn? If there is no agricultural production, how will the people's livelihood be resolved? The future crisis is truly unimaginable. In Qishe Township and Qingfan Township of the same county, the village and Baojia heads are being held responsible for collecting the overdue grain. However, some farmers have indeed paid repeatedly, and have been searched and dragged repeatedly, leaving them with no rice for food or seeds for planting. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. How will they repay their debts? The Baojia heads cannot fulfill their duties, and I heard that some have been executed and died unjustly. How can this calm the people's hearts, stabilize their livelihoods, revitalize the country, and lay the foundation for the nation? The suffering of the farmers is evident. Below is an excerpt from a letter of complaint from a rural woman and her husband:</p>
<p>"...Tomorrow, we will have to pay three stones and five dou of grain again. I harvested a total of eight stones of rough rice. We have already eaten five dou, leaving only six stones and five dou. We started eating it last December. There are five or six people in our family, each eating half a liter a day. We have already eaten more than three stones. At the same time, my son took one stone and one dou. If we have to pay another one stone and five dou of grain, how will we, mother and daughters, survive on the remaining one stone? Now, the villagers are willing to pay three dou of grain per mu, but they insist on five dou per mu. We are currently pleading for exemption. If we cannot get an exemption, I am afraid we will have to pay the third time. These days, I am so anxious that I am beside myself. If we pay all the grain, how will we, mother and daughters, survive? If we do not pay the grain, we do not even have enough rice to eat... This year, we have a total of more than six stones of rice, and we still have to pay grain. Moreover, we started eating it last December, plus this year's intercalary month, what should we do? Moreover, Ming'er has a stomach ache, Father is sick, and Jian'er and Bi'er both have coughs, which is very severe... Wife Qiaoxian, handwriting."</p>
<p>After reading this letter of complaint from a rural woman, we can understand the general plight and suffering of farmers. There are many others who cannot cry out, who cannot voice their suffering. However, the factors that caused this situation are certainly very complex. Last year, under the leadership of Gu Shiheng, the Minister of Food who only cared about his own interests, Jiangsu province was governed in a corrupt and inept manner. Those above followed the example of those below, engaging in inflated collections, false reports, deductions, smuggling, and all kinds of malfeasance. How could the suffering of the farmers not be deep? It is all due to poor governance that has led to today's unmanageable situation. Although some farmers colluded with local ruffians and corrupt officials to engage in malfeasance, most law-abiding farmers had already paid as ordered. The suffering they endured from heavy taxation and exploitation is so profound that they are no longer willing to cultivate the land. This kind of harm to the entire people is a regrettable disaster. How can we make up for its impact on people's faith in peace and their view of the support of allied countries? Therefore, rescuing the farmers is the most important task at present. We urgently hope that both the Chinese and Japanese authorities will pay serious attention to it, especially during this period of High Intensity Pacification. If supervision is not strict and mistakes are repeated, how can we win the people's hearts!" Another reader told me a shocking and tragic fact.</p>
<p>"Recently, a tragic incident occurred in the area between Suzhou and Shanghai, as described below:</p>
<p>A farmer's family of four, two adults and two children, relied on a few acres of meager land, and their annual income was barely enough to make ends meet. Last year, because of the corruption in food administration in Suzhou, they were asked to pay grain again this spring. The grain was collected by the Baozhang of that area. The superiors also paid the Baozhang to handle the collection of grain money, so it was also called "Baojia Rice." The farmer had already paid off the Baojia Rice last year, but now the Baozhang used his power to force him to pay again. However, his family was truly poor and had no rice left to eat. He could not pay. The weak and ignorant farmer could not withstand the threats and had no choice but to sell his wife and children and use the money to pay. Unexpectedly, not long after, they came to collect again. Under the 'fierce government is more fierce than a tiger,' the Baozhang's order could not be disobeyed, and there was no way to complain. He killed his two children to prevent them from suffering in the future, and then hanged himself. His wife heard the tragic news, and overcome with grief, she also committed suicide. Later, the husband (the one who sold his wife and children) witnessed this tragic scene and was filled with grief and anger. He thought that he should not have bought his wife, which caused this disaster. His conscience was uneasy, and he blamed himself, so he also committed suicide. Alas! These five innocent people died unjustly at the hands of the Baozhang. How can farmers be willing to cultivate the land again?</p>
<p>What do you think after hearing this tragic case? Currently, the Baozhang in the countryside are wielding great power, relying on the military to bully the people. There are countless such examples."</p>
<p>Anyone who has read these two letters will surely know how the Chinese countryside is currently being ruled by vicious and evil forces. The Shen Bao editorial of May 16, "On County Administration," stated in its opening sentence: "Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a surface." In economic terms, the "point" and "line" are entirely cultivated by the "surface." In fact, the entire population of Shanghai and Nanjing, no matter how much they clamor and shout, cannot produce a single grain of rice. All of these people rely on the products of the farmers scattered on the "surface." Looking at the current situation, no matter how fair we think it is, we cannot say that the point and line provide an equivalent supply (industrial products) to the farmers. The citizens of Shanghai and Nanjing contribute little to the farmers, but in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they are beyond the reach of the farmers.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the symptom of China's illness. The countryside is in such a bad situation that farmers are hesitating on the wrong path and not actively participating in the political life of the peace zone. Without the participation of farmers in Chinese politics, hoping for success is futile. Premier Sun knew best the importance of Chinese farmers in politics. The following words of his are enough to prove that I am not speaking without reason, and at the same time, I believe that in his following words, he pointed out the direction China should take.</p>
<p>"First of all, the general farmers must know what responsibilities they have to the country and what benefits they expect from the country... If the farmers do not participate in the revolution, then our revolution has no foundation... To add to the peasant movement is to use the peasants as the foundation, to use the peasants as the revolutionary foundation of our party... If this foundation cannot be consolidated, our revolution will fail" (Land to the Tiller), (Lu Translation)</p>
<h3>Elite Japanese Air Force Units Strike Fogon American Airfield, Japanese Forces Launch Offensive in the Kaladan Valley</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese air force units in Burma, on the 15th, suddenly used a combined large formation of bombers and fighters to bomb the American forward base at Sazbu Airfield in the Dakon area. One team attacked the southern airfield, destroying its runways and airport facilities, food depots, etc. Another team simultaneously attacked the northern airfield, destroying its runways and two small aircraft and fifteen gliders on the ground. At the same time, Japanese fighter squadrons discovered more than sixty enemy military vehicles on the road connecting the two airfields in the north and south. Braving heavy ground fire, they bravely bombed them, and all aircraft safely returned to base. On the same day, other capable combined large formations also strongly attacked the enemy airborne unit airfield.

<h3>Spare No Sacrifice for the Liberation of the Motherland, General Bose Issues Proclamation to the Seven Books</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency) - Indian National Army Commander-in-Chief Bose, for the liberation of the motherland, is now sharing food and sleeping with his generals and soldiers, standing on the front line, and resisting the British enemy who are desperately defending Imphal. On the 19th of this month, in the name of the Supreme Commander of the National Army, he issued a proclamation to the generals and soldiers as follows: Fellow soldiers, since our army launched the Great Indian Independence War in February 1944, it has gradually moved towards the motherland. The heroic generals and soldiers of our army are fighting for the liberation of the motherland and advancing bravely, which is unprecedented. If you have not forgotten, you can remember what I said: the liberation war only begins after we break into the Indian border. However, this kind of war is very difficult. Since our army attacked the motherland of India, the British enemy has been in a critical situation. The reason why they are desperately defending and protecting resources is to maintain their ruling position in India. We believe that although the liberation war is difficult and great, we will be able to achieve final victory. I and you are now standing on the front line, and we deeply know your difficult situation. However, for the survival and liberation of the 380 million compatriots of our motherland India, we should spare no sacrifice and strive to complete this war. My Supreme Command pays close attention to the frontline troops and is now studying the necessary foolproof measures. In this difficult environment, the frontline has achieved such great results, which is a good omen for the final victory. The survival and liberation of the 380 million compatriots of the motherland India are completely tied to your shoulders. I am confident that you will be able to complete this great task of killing yourself to achieve benevolence and liberating the motherland.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Cooperative Branch Section Chief and Others Embezzle</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan received a confidential report from relevant parties that the Nanjing Branch of the China Cooperative Society was suspected of serious embezzlement, and immediately ordered the Medical Affairs Committee of the Society to conduct an autonomous investigation. They discovered that Wang Yiqiu, former purchasing section chief, Shi Zhengji, section member, Sun Yulin, former finance section chief, and Chen Qifa, former director of the Shangxinhe branch, did indeed have evidence of embezzlement. They also received a report from the Liaison Director of the Trust, Xiao Feng, confirming the facts.

Wang Yiqiu and others were arrested and interrogated strictly in late last month. Furthermore, on the 15th of this month, the Chairman of the Society, Ji Dianwu, was also summoned for interrogation and temporarily released on bail. Yesterday, the Department transferred the criminals to the Capital District Court for legal action.

<h3>Large Allied Force Assembles in Southern England to Prepare for Invasion of Europe; Adverse Weather Affects Military Operations</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities issued the following statement on the Allied forces' landing operations on the 19th: The British and neutral press have recently reported that a major offensive will be launched soon, but it is not yet known when it will be launched. Although the British and Americans have assembled a large army in southern England, waiting to move out, the final preparations have not yet been completed, so the date of the operation seems to need to be postponed again. Moreover, landing operations must be determined by the weather. It is impossible to cross the Dover Strait in a storm. The weather in the Dover Strait area has been bad for the past five or six days, so the Allied forces have missed the good opportunity for a landing. In addition, the Allied air offensive has been stagnant during this period, and the transportation network in the German-occupied area, which was damaged in the air raids, has been gradually repaired. At the same time, German reconnaissance planes have recently taken the opportunity to scout the enemy's preparations.</p>

<h3>Allied Special Issue for Japanese Navy Memorial Day: The Battle of Tsushima: A War Diary</h3>

On an island two miles from the battlefield at sea, the late Chief Clerk Munakata Shigemaru and Sako Ichigorō wrote a diary, detailing the naval battle they witnessed at the time. This diary is now permanently preserved at the official Munakata Shrine. It is translated and reprinted here, reflecting on the past and inspiring a new determination to defeat England and America.</p>
<p>May 27th, Meiji 38 (1905): Strong westerly wind, cloudy, very foggy.</p>
<p>1. At around 7:40 this morning, we received a report from the watchtower stating that the enemy fleet appeared to be passing through the eastern channel and that we should pay close attention. From noon onwards, the sound of cannons could be heard rumbling from the northwest of the island. At around 1:00 PM, we received a notice stating that our fleet was not in sight. Therefore, everyone focused their attention and kept a close watch on the sea. From around 2:10 PM, the sound of cannons seemed to be getting closer, but focusing on the west, because the fog was heavy today, nothing could be seen beyond five nautical miles at sea, making observation quite difficult. At 2:30 PM, a warship appeared four nautical miles southwest, surrounded by artillery fire on all sides, fighting hard, and in a difficult battle. Because the distance was quite far, it was impossible to tell whether it was an enemy ship or our own, but as we stared intently, we were surprised to see that our fleet was being bombarded by enemy ships, retreating as they fought. Soon, the enemy fleet, totaling eighteen ships, with a combined five or six mine-laying ships and destroyers, suddenly appeared four nautical miles away. The formation was disorganized, and even though the fleet included mine-laying ships and destroyers, they were proceeding westward. We were all filled with anger, but there was nothing we could do. The watchtower immediately sent urgent telegrams to various locations. At this time, everyone was watching the enemy's movements. At 2:40 PM, we suddenly saw four warships appear in the southwest. We thought they were the follow-up troops of the enemy fleet, and we were deeply afraid. Gazing at them, we were overjoyed because it was our ships Chiyoda, Akashi, Yakumo, and Iwate that had come in search and pursuit. They immediately began firing, and the thunderous sound of cannons increased without ceasing, as if the sky were falling and the earth were collapsing. Gunsmoke obscured the sea surface, and flashes of fire made the sea god tremble in alarm. Adding to this were the raging winds and waves sweeping the sea. The scene, which had been shrouded in a light mist since morning, became even more somber, creating a most tragic feeling. At 3:00 PM, our ships were pressing the enemy, and the enemy ships turned to try to escape. We intercepted them. At this time, more than fifty of our main fleet ships appeared in the distance at sea, cutting off their retreat and surrounding them in attack. The enemy formation became increasingly chaotic, struggling to escape. Our ships chased and sailed northwest. By 4:00 PM, the enemy ranks were torn apart, trying to escape in different directions. At this time, there were three naval battles taking place. Battleships fought each other in pairs, and destroyers and cruisers also lined up and fired at each other. Two enemy ships caught fire, one mast broke, the engine room was damaged, and they were listing, struggling to stay afloat. One of our ships (it seemed to be the Iwate) was also damaged, temporarily leaving the formation to retreat to the rear for repairs, but quickly rejoined the battle line. From about 5:00 PM onwards, it became a close-range battle. As it was getting further away from the island and the sky was getting dark, we could no longer see anything. At around 8:00 PM, we received a telephone report that three enemy ships were proceeding southwest. It was dark and impossible to see, so we relied on searchlights for vigilance. The sailor Sasa Songnosuke immediately climbed to the top of the mast and saw a white light opposite the Straits to the east. He immediately reported to the watchtower. This ship seemed to be the one that escaped from the sea about 30 degrees away. The sound of cannons continued faintly throughout the night. Everyone stayed up all night, waiting for news, until dawn.</p>
<p>May 28th</p>
<p>1. The weather today is clear and calm, making it possible to see far out to sea. If today had been yesterday, it would have been easier to watch the battle. According to intelligence, a great battle is taking place between us in the vicinity of Songdao Island in Korea. At 10:00 AM, we received a telegram stating that at least four enemy ships had been sunk. The sound of cannons could still be heard rumbling incessantly. At 3:00 PM, the Fuso, Tsugaru, and Takao passed through the northwest.</p>
<p>May 29th</p>
<p>1. At 10:00 AM today, the Iwate and Yakumo passed through the sea eight nautical miles southeast of this island. Because they were not identified, we thought they were enemy ships, causing a great commotion. After they were identified, and we learned of the news of our army's great victory, everyone shouted "Banzai!" (Translated by Shō from the May 26th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to Southern Iyo, the Birthplace of the Japanese Navy - Yasushi Yoneyama</h3>
<p>Iyo's mountains and rivers, embracing the poetic Seto Inland Sea and the raging Pacific Ocean (Note 1), are a fitting match for the name Ehime (Note 2), like a dignified Japanese woman. In particular, the southern part of Iyo, bordering the sea on three sides, is sandwiched between the Bungo Channel to the west, vaguely facing Bungo and Hyuga provinces, overlooking Suo across the Iyo Sea to the north, and facing the vast and undulating Pacific Ocean to the south. This is a warm southern land where tropical plants such as coconut palms flourish, orange blossoms are fragrant, and summer oranges fill the branches, the martial victory paradise where the ancestors of the Japanese people settled after crossing the sea from the south. Before knowing the history of the Hachiman ships (Note 3), the history of the land of Southern Iyo unfolds at the same time as the first page of Japanese ethnic history. And for the tradition of the Southern Iyo people, bold, grand, and delicate, born from the blood of southern people, the Seto Sea, and the Kuroshio Current, it is necessary to understand it further. However, the author, who came here in search of sea history, was overwhelmed by the beauty of the mountains and rivers, the clarity of the blue sky, and the lessons of historical sites. There is both the village that raised the banner of loyalism high during the Kokoku era, when the south wind did not compete, and the ancient battlefield where warriors fought for supremacy and the bloody isolated island occupied by the pirate Fujiwara no Sumitomo. Islands, rivers, and mountain ridges are all historical remains. Although the mountains and rivers are silent, the urgent, compelling nostalgic sentiment is an irreplaceable feast for travelers.</p>
<p>Pirates and Submarines</p>
<p>Isamu Yoshii has a special song about Hiraburi Island: "Pirate face with thick eyebrows and large eyes, don't forget the summer of Hiraburi."</p>
<p>Hiraburi is a small island facing Uwajima, the eye of the Toyo Channel. This island and its surroundings are nothing less than a poetic sea park, but in the Tenkyō era, it was the base of the sea hawk Fujiwara no Sumitomo, and in the era of contention between Genki and Tensho, it was the ancient battlefield of a great naval battle stage. After occupying this island, Sumitomo led 4,000 pirates from Southern Iyo and 1,000 warships, sweeping across the West Sea. On the high hills of Hiraburi Island, there are traces of labor. There stands a large stele of Mikage stone built by Kamasaburo Yamashita, the maritime king of Showa who was born in Southern Iyo. Thinking back, this hero had filled his stomach with ambition and gazed at the sea and sky of Southern Iyo. The stele is inscribed with the large characters "The Land Where the Pirate Fujiwara no Sumitomo Domiciled," in a powerful hand. It is said that when Yamashita wrote this stele, he added the line "Built by Pirate Kamasaburo Yamashita," which caused his associates to feel particularly perplexed. Sumitomo's well-trained navy, its tactics and navigation skills were unparalleled at the time, roaming the Seto Inland Sea area, and no one dared to challenge its sharpness. In the fourth year of Tenkyō, when Fujiwara no Tadahira was appointed Shogun, the naval forces of the Kono clan and other pirates of Eastern Iyo, who were ordered to suppress Sumitomo's navy, staged desperate maneuvers in various parts of the Inland Sea, relentlessly pursuing Sumitomo's army, and finally played the final triumph in the Battle of Dazaifu. In this battle, the official naval forces of the Kono clan and others used sophisticated new weapons, which were small warships with three to eight holes in the bottom of the boat, with a tube for ventilation on the deck. In the event of a decisive battle, they opened the holes in the bottom of the boat and let in an appropriate amount of seawater, causing the ship to sink seven-tenths below the surface of the sea. In this way, they ambushed the enemy, and when approaching the enemy ship, they suddenly lifted the deck, or rushed onto the enemy ship, or shot arrows fiercely. In short, this small boat can be said to be the ancestor of the submarines that are important tools in today's naval battles. The Iyo navy knew how to use such new skills a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Iyo and Hachiman Ships</p>
<p>Extending the coastline by 310 miles and residing on more than 200 islands, the ancestors of the Japanese nation, while reclaiming land, wandered the sea, and their spirit reached China's 400 provinces, and even crossed the ocean to reach the coconut grove-filled South Seas. The Wako pirates, who were famous, were also founded by the people of Southern Iyo. The dugout canoes of various southern races for crossing the ocean, the blueprint was the Hachiman ships of the Iyo people, which were developed by conquering the tides and climate and following the footsteps of the Japanese. The sailors on the Hachiman ships, although composed of brave men from all over Japan, the commanders were often from the Iyo clan.</p>
<p>After Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the pirate prohibition order in the sixteenth year of Tensho, although the pirates changed their ways, the people of Southern Iyo, who were born at sea and had a bold spirit, secretly guarded the tradition of the Iyo navy. The origin of the name Yawatahama City is said to be in the Hachiman ships. The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides, facing the sea only on the west side. Today, it is a lively port city, and in its rough spirit, one can imagine the ancient appearance. (To be continued) (Translated from Weekly Asahi No. 1219)</p>
<p>Note 1: Kuroshio is a type of ocean current that runs along the coast of the Japanese archipelago and is a warm current. Its water has a dark blue-black color, hence the name.</p>
<p>Note 2: Ehime is also written as Aihime, which is the name used to deify Iyo Province.</p>
<p>Note 3: Hachiman ships were ships that some Kansai generals drove out to sea at the end of the Muromachi Shogunate, and because they hoisted the banner of "Hachiman Bosatsu," they were also called by that name.</p>

<p>The supply of wartime materials cannot be as abundant as in peacetime. During wartime, everything we use on a daily basis is strived to be saved. In particular, electricity is reduced due to inconvenient coal transportation and reduced production, while the demand in the industrial production sector is increasing. Therefore, the conservation of electricity must be taken seriously. The use of electricity in this city has been restricted since December last year, and considerable results have been achieved. However, in the continuation of the war, in order to ensure the necessity of industrial production and to maintain the permanence of other electricity uses, it is still necessary to emphasize conservation. The Huazhong Water and Electricity Company's campaign to promote summer electricity conservation aims to awaken citizens to make full use of sunlight and save light. The savings can be used to increase production. For general users, it does not feel too difficult, while the industrial production sector benefits greatly. It can be said that this is a very meaningful measure. All of us citizens should deeply understand this and strive to implement it. During the summer season, the days are long. We can work at sunrise and rest at dusk, which is a good way to use the conservation of light to maintain a disciplined life, improve health, facilitate air defense, and benefit production. This is truly a win-win situation for ourselves and for others. If there are any negligent people who waste public utilities and do not know how to examine themselves, once they are discovered, the supply will inevitably be stopped, and they will suffer the consequences. As for the electricity company, it should also strictly investigate the adjustment and reduction of electricity, and rationally allocate it, so that those in need are not in short supply, and the empty readings are not indulged. We should cooperate with each other to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power. I have great expectations.</p>
<p>Minister Usami's Speech</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with the importance of electricity in carrying out the war, so there is no need to repeat it, but the current power saving is no less important than saving gasoline, especially in Shanghai, where the source of electricity is purely mountainous power generation, and the fuel for thermal power generation depends on coal, but coal and the transportation of coal are closely related to combat power. In addition, it is even more necessary to ensure the electricity for the production of military supplies and daily necessities, so not only must we not waste electricity, but even the necessary electricity must first be transmitted to the most important areas, so even one degree of electricity must be saved as much as possible. For the above reasons, since November last year, we have been implementing the adjustment and monitoring of electricity consumption, and this time, from a seasonal point of view, we believe that the current period is the easiest to implement electricity saving, so we will first implement electricity saving for lighting to meet the needs of the current situation. Starting today, we will implement the "Electricity Saving Campaign" for a period of three months. Although the target of this conservation is lighting, factories should also pay special attention to conserving electricity used for power and other purposes, which is truly urgent. That is, each household and each agency should not only save electricity for lighting but also try to save electricity used for other purposes, so as to contribute to the victory of the Greater East Asia War and hope to have no regrets. As for the method of saving, you can consult with the power company. If each user has a good idea for saving electricity, you can also publish it as much as possible. For example, during the summer months, change nighttime work to the morning, or reduce nighttime entertainment, which is not only beneficial to refreshing daily life but also saves electricity, which is truly a win-win situation. I hope to save one second of electricity, just like a drop of blood. We deeply hope that those who use valuable electricity for improper entertainment will wake up. In addition, saving electricity and the purpose of wartime lighting control also coincide, so we also hope that you will consider and save on the size of the bulb's brightness and the number of lights. In addition, in implementing this conservation campaign, we will never change the previously stipulated user limits, but purely hope that each user will cooperate out of their own accord and sincerity. On the other hand, we will send an investigation team to conduct inspections, and anyone who is not sincerely cooperative will be given appropriate punishment. As for the authorities, in order to make the consumption of electricity fair and reasonable, we will make further efforts in the future, and we hope that each user will also fully understand the meaning of saving electricity and continue to cooperate. I am very eager for this.</p>

<h3>A Brief Biography of Mr. Chen Youren - Information Office of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren was from Shunde County, Guangdong Province. He was born in the 37th year before the founding of the Republic of China (1875) and is now 69 years old. His mother is still alive and well, over 90 years old. Both his father and maternal uncle once held positions in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After the failure of the Taiping Rebellion, they fled to the island of Trinidad in the Atlantic Ocean. In his early years, Mr. Chen studied law in England and practiced as a lawyer in Trinidad and London. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Mr. Chen abandoned his profession and returned to China from London via Moscow, serving as a legal advisor to the Ministry of Transportation. Subsequently, he was hired by the English-language Beijing Daily and the English-language Peking Gazette to preside over their writing, advocating against Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, for which he was imprisoned. After his release, he went to Shanghai to establish the English-language Shanghai Gazette. After the end of World War I, Mr. Chen was appointed as an informal representative of the Southern Government to the Paris Peace Conference. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), Mr. Sun Yat-sen established a government in Guangzhou and appointed Mr. Chen as his foreign affairs advisor and director of the Aviation Bureau. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north, and Mr. Chen accompanied him. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, Mr. Chen resided in Beijing and founded the English-language Minbao (People's News) to oppose the warlords, for which he was again imprisoned. In the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), he returned to Guangdong and served as a member of the Central Political Conference and Minister of Foreign Affairs, presiding over revolutionary diplomacy during the Northern Expedition. During this time, he oversaw the recovery of the concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the Ninghan split occurred, and Mr. Chen traveled to Europe with Madame Sun Yat-sen. In the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), when a government was established in Guangzhou, Mr. Chen resumed his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), he went to Europe again, residing there for several years. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic (1938), he returned to China from Europe, residing in Hong Kong. In the winter of the thirtieth year of the Republic (1941), the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong. In April of the following year, he came to Shanghai. In July of that year, he published an essay on the current situation, hoping that Japan would sincerely change its policy towards China to facilitate a comprehensive peace and offering encouragement to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>In the recent two years, Mr. Chen resided in Shanghai, living a secluded life with little contact with the outside world, focusing on the research of "Solutions to Post-War World Problems." Regrettably, this book was not yet completed when he passed away suddenly from heart disease at 3:05 AM on May 20th. His will stipulated that his body be cremated, without burial or a tombstone, and that his ashes be scattered in the ocean, returning to the void. A simple ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM on May 22nd in the hall of the Jing'an Temple Cemetery. In accordance with Mr. Chen's will, his wife respectfully declined all wreaths and elegiac couplets.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Chen was known to the world as a strong-willed diplomat, he was extremely humble and amiable in his interactions with people, earning him the respect and love of his friends. As a senior figure in the press, he was fair, outspoken, and insightful, with many unique perspectives. In his handling of matters and judgments, he was able to consider the overall situation. His unwavering will and resolute governance were particularly characteristic of Mr. Chen, and he spared no effort in his love and promotion of the arts.</p>

<h3>Mr. Chen Youren's Final Moments</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>I have just returned home after witnessing the passing of Mr. Chen Youren. At 3:05 AM today (May 20th), Mr. Chen passed away peacefully and lucidly at his home, under the care of his beloved wife and two or three close friends. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in his liver and was instructed by doctors to have complete rest. However, Mr. Chen did not listen and continued to contemplate the destiny of China and Asia in his bed. Whenever he thought of something, he would dictate it to his wife to write down. I believe that Mr. Chen foresaw his impending death, so he wanted to complete his final writings for the nation as soon as possible. When I met him two weeks ago, Mr. Chen was still full of energy and said in bed that under such a tense situation, the future of China and Asia was still uncertain, and this was destined. His particularly sharp gaze was directed towards the ceiling, and he repeated "destined, destined" twice. Since then, Mr. Chen's nerves have been unusually agitated. Yesterday, a friend of mine visited Mr. Chen and said that Mr. Chen was very excited yesterday and today and that his condition was nearing a critical stage. Therefore, when I heard this, I planned to inquire about his condition tomorrow. Suddenly, I received a phone call saying that Mr. Chen's condition had deteriorated rapidly and was extremely serious. At about 1:30 AM, I rushed to Mr. Chen's residence, but at that time, Mr. Chen was already in a coma, and his face was covered with a thick color of death. His wife sat at the head of the bed, frequently rubbing Mr. Chen's neck with her hands, but Mr. Chen was just breathing rapidly and sleeping in a daze. It was clear that his breath was becoming increasingly thin. His wife's eyes were full of tears, showing an Easterner's patience in suppressing the infinite pain in her spirit. We could not bear to watch the suffering of the dying and the suffering of those left behind, so we went to the next room for a while. It was very quiet, without any sound. Such a quiet night, it was hard to imagine that this was Shanghai's night. "China's wise star" will be permanently separated from the human world. I believe it should be a noisy night to match. At this time, his wife was quietly calling Mr. Chen, and the voice of "darling, darling" came from the post office. Knowing that heaven could not hear, she was still making sad sounds as if complaining to someone. Outside, there was no sound. Outside the window, in the gray dawn, a large tree of unknown origin was flickering. Suddenly, the door of the next room opened, and the nurse said, "He has passed away peacefully." We hurried in to see that Mr. Chen's breathing had become intermittent. However, his face was calmer than just now. This was like the calm face of a warrior who had ended his final battle. This great warrior had dedicated his entire life to the cause of the nation, and his body would now rest here. (Written at 6:00 AM on May 20th) Translated by Lu</p>

<p>Special Issue in Memory of Mr. Shen Xinqing</p>
<h3>Biography of Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Jiang Weiqiao</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's given name was Enfú, courtesy name Xinqing, also known as Xin'an, pseudonym Jianyí, and late-life name Ruòyīng. Originally from Chóu County, to avoid the turmoil of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, his family moved to Jiading. His mother, Lady Wang, was the daughter of the Wang Jingmen family of Jiading. Mr. Shuo Zhi had four sons, Mr. Shen being the youngest. He was attentive and loved by his parents. It is said that Mr. Shen could write articles at the age of four, and at the age of six, he often sat beside his mother, who taught him classical texts, and his appearance was like that of a veteran scholar. In the same year, his grandparents had a picture painted of him and asked Mr. Xiang Zhi to inscribe it, with the line "Never heard of a six-year-old being a teacher." At the age of eight, he studied with his elder brother, Xijurong. At fifteen, he was selected as a student of the Imperial Academy. From then on, he devoted himself to the study of Shuowen Jiezi and the supplement Tongxun Dinggu. At the age of twenty, he married into the Yang family. At twenty-four, he suffered the loss of his mother, and three years later, he suffered the loss of his father. Mr. Shen cried bitterly, saying, "From now on, I want to honor my parents and make a name for myself, but my parents will not be able to see it." Subsequently, he studied at the Shanghai Longmen Academy, studying the ways of governing the world day and night, believing that the scholars of the Song dynasty each had their own schools and could not go beyond the scope of Confucian learning. The key was to apply the classics to practical use, and even the study of poetry and prose could sometimes reveal the Dao, which should be sufficient for worldly use. Mr. Shen's family was poor, relying on the subsidy from the academy to support themselves. He always ranked first in the examinations, so he accumulated surplus funds every year, and his literary reputation was widely known. Many people followed him in his studies. He repeatedly failed the provincial examinations, and it was not until the 甲午 (Jiǎwǔ) year (1894) that he passed the local examination. Mr. Shen was already thirty-one years old. At that time, it was after the Sino-Japanese War, and the examinations were suspended. Since he was unsuccessful in the Ministry of Rites examination, he had no intention of pursuing an official career and devoted himself to education. When the Qing government issued an edict to promote education, Mr. Shen accepted the invitation of the Saishan Academy to serve as the head teacher. Many outstanding students from Shanghai and Jiading came to him. In the 甲辰 (Jiǎchén) year (1904), former classmates of Longmen discussed converting the old site of the academy into a provincial normal school. Mr. Shen, along with Yuan Xitao, Ye Jingxi, and Xia Yueao, went to Japan to study education. Upon returning, he served as the superintendent, and the students were well-behaved, lecturing on the classics. Within a few years, the results were remarkable, and they were emulated by various provinces. Zhang Jian of Nantong heard that Mr. Shen had achieved success in running schools and earnestly invited him to concurrently serve as the chief editor of the China Bookstore Company. Mr. Shen felt that concurrent positions were inappropriate, so he resigned from the position of superintendent and took up the position of editor. Fellow Jiangsu natives founded the Jiangsu Academic Association, and Mr. Shen was elected as a councilor. Later, he resigned due to financial difficulties at the Bookstore Company, and the Academic Association was renamed the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. Mr. Shen served as the resident administrator for more than ten years. In view of the ever-changing educational theories of various countries in the East and West, he selected those that conformed to China's national conditions for the members to study. He shared the research results with the authorities, hoping to see them implemented. He opened up lectures to the public and the academic community. He also initiated the National Education Association, and Mr. Shen was elected as its chairman. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Shen suggested to the Jiangsu Governor Cheng Dequan that he should be the first to respond, and Cheng followed his advice, thus ensuring the safety of the southeast. Cheng appointed Mr. Shen as the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Department, advocating for honesty among officials. He proposed to separate military and civilian affairs, and the provincial governor Ying Dehong treated Mr. Shen like a younger brother, appointing him as the chief secretary. Mr. Shen was grateful for the recognition and devoted himself to assisting him. All the provincial regulations were written by him. After the Second Revolution, the governor's office was reorganized, and Mr. Shen retired, still residing in the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), he and his colleagues founded the Chinese Vocational Education Society to cultivate vocational talents. Later, Fan Yuanlian, the Minister of Education, appointed Mr. Shen as the Director of Education of Hunan, but he strongly declined. He said, "The country suffers from having too many officials, and society suffers from having too few people serving." The opinion was highly regarded by the court. In the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic (1922-1923), he founded the Lishi Society, editing modern historical materials, collecting newspapers and magazines, covering all aspects of朝章團故兵刑禮樂農工商礦社會風俗 (court regulations, group affairs, war, punishment, rites, music, agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, social customs), categorizing them, adding annotations, pressing them into thousands of volumes, like a net with a rope, for scholars to study. He gradually expanded it into the Humanistic Library, which is now known as the Hongying Library. Mr. Shen presided over the library affairs until the end of his life. In his later years, he felt compassion for the world and created the Rongwu Sutra Society and the Confucius Society, intending to harmonize all religions and advance towards a great unity. What a grand aspiration! Mr. Shen had a strong constitution and was able to cook for himself, eating and drinking more than others. He always exercised in the morning and rarely suffered from any illness. He was widowed at the age of sixty-six, and deeply mourned his beloved wife. Suddenly, he suffered from口眼喎斜 (facial paralysis), which lasted for a long time before recovery. After the age of seventy-five, he was always hungry, but soon recovered. However, despite his strong will, his illnesses increased day by day, yet he still went to the library every day, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. Even when he was hemiplegic, he still insisted on serving the public. After the autumn of last year, he was unable to walk and began to rest at home. Every day, he would have someone help him up to read books and sing poems. As winter deepened, his illness worsened, and his mind gradually became disordered. He passed away on April 4th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), at the age of eighty-one. Mr. Shen's calligraphy was vigorous and beautiful, influenced by Yan Zhenqing, Liu Gongquan, and Wang Xizhi. His poetry resembled that of Li Bai and Du Fu. His surviving works include several volumes of poems and prose. Before the burial, his old friends and colleagues agreed to posthumously name him Mr. Qinyi (勤毅, Diligent and Resolute). He had two sons: Yougan, a doctor from Stanford University in the United States; and Youding, a doctor from Harvard University in the United States. He also had four daughters: Youyao, married to Wang; Yougui, married to Hu; Youqi, a manager at a Women's Commercial Bank; and Youlin, a teacher at Yunchong Girls' School.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Wu Bangzhen</p>
<p>On this 20th day of May in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Hongying Library, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Shen Bao Industrial and Artistic Institute, the Confucius Society, the Rongwu Sutra Society, the Yi Xue Hui (I Ching Society), and Shen Wei, Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Yuanji, Sun Jing, Wen Lanting, Jiang Weiqiao, Lu Guiliang, Xu Yuan, and others, with clear water, incense, and flowers, offer this eulogy to the spirit of the venerable Mr. Qinyi Shen: Alas! Heaven has bestowed longevity upon Mr. Shen, why withhold health and tranquility? Heaven has burdened Mr. Shen with worries and hardships, why not allow him to witness peace and prosperity? The mystery of this common sense causes sorrow in our hearts. We grieve the long departure of a seasoned figure, merely imagining his model.</p>
<p>We recall Mr. Shen's grand demeanor, upright integrity, kindness to others, and self-discipline. He played the flute in the Deer Park, followed the path of Longmen, applied the classics to practical use, learned from the past, and knew the new. He lamented the country's difficulties and championed education. Rivers flow eastward, schools flourished beyond the three Wu regions, and the path of learning was established for generations to come. In middle age, the Republic was established, and he acted on his words, governed the people, and served the world. He cleansed blemishes, encouraged virtue, exerted efforts to govern, built official positions with the wisdom of knowing people, and promoted justice and fulfilled the benefits of enriching people. He further exerted all his strength to realize his initial aspirations. Schools were filled with students, cultivating talents. Across the north and south of the Yangtze River, he promoted the grand plan of education, and his reputation extended to the east and west, aspiring to the grandest of unity. Although he did not achieve perfection and longevity, his great purpose was already slightly tested. Only education will be sworn to forever. He gathered educational assemblies throughout the province, advanced the cause of academic research, expanded forums, advanced morality, investigated the origin and explored the principles, guided the way on the right path, contributed to assisting education, established the model for today's world, and was respected by all. For ten years, he managed numerous affairs, regardless of criticism or praise, he felt at peace in his heart as long as the principles were right.</p>
<p>He then led Hongying, presiding over the library administration, encompassing all phenomena and managing hundreds of cities. Rites, music, military, agriculture, government, education, decrees, and orders, were like a net with a rope, in an orderly manner, showing the way for future scholars, storing materials for future historians. He focused his mind and eyes, not tiring from work, progressing daily and advancing monthly, without getting lost in his mind. Mr. Shen regarded public affairs as his own affairs, taking great responsibility as his own responsibility, devoting his efforts to the end of his life, and receiving honor at the end of his old age. Alas! The country's steps are difficult, the divine land is disturbed, the fog blocks the heavens, and the stench is heard on the islands. Mr. Shen felt compassion for the world, worried about the times, and embraced the Dao. He expressed his love for the country through poetry and felt subtly touched by the spirit of hope. Despite the turbulent years, he felt that the coming days would be long and forgot his old age. How could he have known that he would suddenly fall ill and quickly run out of treatment? He traveled to the Taoist mountain, and his subtle presence disappeared. We ask what era is this, sadly, the world is in darkness, regrettably, not being born, escaping the evil paths of the three realms. Today, one soul is not asleep, rising through the gates, and in the future, the nine states will be unified, listening to the family's sacrifices.</p>
<p>Colleagues and others either interacted with the Dao, or were close relatives, or participated in common affairs, or received his guidance, lamenting the gradual isolation of similar people, and grief is extreme. We regret the eternal separation between humans and heaven, but the friendship and public morality still exist. The two words "honor and sorrow" are the posthumous title, and the remaining appearance is as before. The heart of reverence and longing for the mulberry and the street. With clean offerings, we respectfully offer sacrifices, and there is a return after a hundred years. He has died and is at peace, and may his bright virtue be fragrant. May he enjoy the offerings.</p>
<h3>Posthumous Title Discussion for Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Xia Jingguan</p>
<p>The beginning of the record of a scholar's deeds is clear in the Qutai (曲臺), and the words of the posthumous title at the funeral are detailed in the Huguan (虎觀). This is because the meaning encompasses guidance, and the evaluation determines the beginning and the end, highlighting the full cultivation of conduct and being a model for human relations. Although the old constitution has changed, the national customs have not declined, and the etiquette is still in great order.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wu County cultivated virtue in the hills, devoted himself to the country, stored thoughts and provided services, labored without relaxation of his heart, practiced the Tao and acted diligently, recorded goodness without negligence, survived as a consultant, and left a remaining light after death. Therefore, based on the accumulated records of his life from various meetings, and the unanimous agreement of the group, the posthumous title is Qinyi (勤毅, Diligent and Resolute). May the spirits in the Nine Springs (九原) be aware and illuminate him.</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Xin</h3>
<p>— Written by Mai Fengzhen</p>
<p>On the dawn of April 5th, I was suddenly struck by news as shocking as a thunderbolt. Just last week, I heard from colleagues at the Hongying Library that Mr. Xin was still in good health. Who could have imagined that this parting would be eternal! I recall last autumn when I, along with gentlemen Gui Liang, Chu Shuyu, and others, gathered with Mr. Xin at the library and took a photograph together. Now, it has become a final farewell! Colleagues in Shanghai urged me to write a biography for Mr. Xin. Who am I to presume to emulate Shi Zhan in composing an epitaph for Tui Zhi! Moreover, Mr. Xin himself had written a self-deprecating biography four years ago, which is still available. However, remembering that I and Mr. Xin have jointly managed educational, municipal, and charitable endeavors for forty years, and our friendship was deep, how could I remain silent? Therefore, I will briefly recount what I know to commemorate him, not daring to call it a biography. Mr. Xin was the younger brother of my maternal aunt's husband from the Fa Shan Tang lineage, making him of my father's generation. Therefore, in my letters, I would address Mr. Xin as "In-zhang" or "In-shishu" (terms of respect for an elder relative through marriage), referring to myself as "In-shizhi" (a term of respect for a younger relative through marriage). Mr. Xin, however, often addressed me as "Sir," such was his humility and respect for those beneath him.</p>
<p>In his prime, Mr. Xin was quite proud and aloof, causing younger generations to approach him with trepidation, often retreating with negative remarks. Only I, before reaching adulthood, had the opportunity to interact with him and received a medical Zheng Kai-style folding fan, which was not easily obtained. (The writing on the fan was from his own poem "My Garden," which included the lines: "Old willows planted long ago are few, the setting sun is lessened by the new cold, I cannot bear the gnawing of insects and ants, let alone the injury from axes." "My Garden" refers to the old site of Longmen, and the poem foreshadowed the future plight of Longmen.) Such was his guidance and encouragement of younger generations. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu's reign, I and my friend Yang Yueru advocated for new education and established the Twenty-two Shop Elementary School. From the following spring onward, we established the Normal Training Institute. Funding was scarce and the situation precarious. At that time, Mr. Xin was serving as the head of the Baoshan County School. Hearing about our efforts, he was delighted and saw it as a welcome sound in a desolate valley. Consequently, I and others led a group of elementary school students on an excursion to Baoshan and Wusong. Mr. Xin graciously welcomed us, offered words of encouragement, and provided lunch. This truly opened a new chapter in our educational endeavors. Such was his enthusiastic response and appreciation of our cause.</p>
<p>At that time, the principal of Longmen Academy was Teacher Tang Kaian. He frequently assigned topics related to current affairs for the monthly examinations, from which I benefited greatly. Later, the topic was to propose the transformation of Longmen Academy into a Normal School. I and others spoke freely and thus a decision was made for Mr. Xin and others to travel to Japan to study education. Upon his return, Mr. Xin was appointed as the Supervisor of Normal Schools and immediately invited colleagues to prepare everything. Three months later, the school opened. And three months after that, he sent me and Mr. Yuan Chuyu to Japan to specialize in education, in order to cultivate talent for the future. Such was his dedication to promoting education and nurturing talent.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Jiangsu Railway, jointly operated by merchants, received widespread support. Mr. Xin was the initiator from the education sector, calling upon teachers and students to contribute whatever they could. Although the final results were minimal, his sincerity was commendable. Such was his eagerness to serve the public interest and his sense of justice.</p>
<p>Before Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, the provincial education association of a certain province sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, requesting a list of petitions. Mr. Xin intended not to respond. I criticized him, saying, "What if they assume our silence as tacit agreement? It would be better to cite the association's regulations, stating that it should not interfere with matters outside of education." Consequently, it was decided to reply accordingly. Later, when the Duan government was in power and undecided about joining the European war, Mr. Xin sympathized with the most scientifically advanced country. Just then, Mr. Liang from Xinhui came to the association seeking advice. My colleagues argued that our country had deeper ties with the Allied Powers. Thereupon, Mr. Xin readily changed his mind. Such was his willingness to yield to others.</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, students and merchants in Shanghai went on strike for more than ten days. The Military Commissioner of Shanghai invited various organizations to consult. Mr. Xin and I were also present. Suddenly, Police Chief Xu began to rant, saying that this matter could be easily suppressed with force and power. Mr. Xin was enraged and said, "The Military Commissioner intended to gather opinions from all sides, yet the Police Chief dares to utter such outrageous words in front of the Commissioner, making trouble unreasonably. I request immediate punishment!" The atmosphere in the meeting was tense and turbulent, but the Military Commissioner remained calm and simply asked, "If the government dismisses Cao, Lu, and Zhang from their positions according to public opinion, can the strikes be ended?" Everyone replied, "Yes." Thus, the storm subsided peacefully, and Mr. Xin also calmed down. Such was his fearlessness in the face of power.</p>
<p>When Mr. Xin was stationed at the association, he devoted his greatest efforts to various lectures, such as the Social Education Lectures, which were managed by Mr. Yu Rizhang, and the Philology Lectures, which were managed by Mr. Xin himself. The academic lectures at that time had a significant impact. Such was his tireless dedication.</p>
<p>Mr. Xin once served as the Chief Editor of the China Book Company. The editors he selected at that time were mostly knowledgeable individuals, and some were just starting their careers in schools. Such was his humility and appreciation of talent.</p>
<p>Mr. Xin was extremely focused in his work. Therefore, when he took on the position of Chief Editor of the Book Company, he resigned from his position as Supervisor. After he was appointed to manage affairs at the Provincial Education Association, he resigned from his position as Chief Editor. He also opposed those who both taught and took exams. My friend Mr. Shuai and I not taking the Ministry of Education's exam for students studying abroad is one example. Such was his dedication.</p>
<p>In the spring of the third year of Xuantong's reign, the Provincial Education Association held a joint meeting in Shanghai, with Mr. Xin as the chairman. He emphasized the proposal for military education in schools and the proposal to abolish the classics in elementary schools. In the summer, the Ministry of Education held a central education conference in Beijing, with Mr. Xin as one of the members. The above two proposals were debated extensively again and were eventually adopted. Such was his ingenuity and eloquence.</p>
<p>After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Xin served as the Deputy Civil Administrator of Jiangsu Province. At that time, the county magistrates of various counties were considered competent, and Mr. Xin played a role in their selection. However, after the Gan Ning Incident in the summer of the second year, Cheng Ying resigned, and Mr. Xin also resigned from his position, returning to manage affairs at the Provincial Education Association. He remained in this position until the Northern Expedition in the sixteenth year, when he resigned. Such was his ability to advance or withdraw according to circumstances.</p>
<p>Since the World War, Mr. Xin advocated that the unification of the world should begin with the harmonization of the five religions. Therefore, he initiated the Five Religions Lecture Society. I once lectured on the similarities between Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, based on the Four Books, Wu Jing, the Dao De Jing, the Zhuangzi, the Diamond Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, and the Heart Sutra. He believed in "transmitting without creating, trusting in and loving antiquity," so as not to border on dogmatism. Mr. Xin greatly approved of this. Therefore, when he lectured on Confucianism, he did not limit himself to Confucian texts but also based his lectures on the Four Books, the Five Classics, and the Zhuangzi. Such was his remarkable memory and quick wit.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mr. Xin enjoyed writing poetry the most. After not seeing him for a few days, his desk would be piled high with poems. Compared to Du Fu's "Poetry History" or Wei Ji's brocade bag, it would not be an exaggeration. Such was his unrelenting passion for poetry.</p>
<p>In his later years, Mr. Xin suffered from a stroke-like illness, becoming deaf, having a stiff tongue, and having difficulty walking. Yet, he still volunteered to take on tasks, not wanting to be comfortable in danger and not wanting to be helped when stumbling, unaware of his advancing age. What was most admirable was that before his eightieth birthday last year, he exerted himself to write couplets and folding fans to support the library. Such was his increasing vigor in old age.</p>
<p>The above account is inevitably disorganized, and I fear that it is insufficient to describe even a fraction of Mr. Xin's qualities.</p>
