<p>社評</p>
<h3>組織民衆</h3>
<p>最近來，無論中國方面，盟邦方面，對於中國民衆的力量，均有相當的認識，這是一個好現象。注重民衆力量之後，接着的便是民衆力量的集中問題，也就是組織民衆問題。一月四日東京每日新聞就說：「如不集合民衆組織起來，收國府絕對不能伸展其政治力量，行使其政令。如果國府的政令不行，則戰意的昂揚，生產的增進，自不可能，因而對戰爭不能有所貢獻。」眞是一針見血！我們以往早就認定，國家的根本在政治，政治的根本在民衆。從事政治的人應該知道，先要使全國的民衆有力量，然後國家方才有偉大的力量。沒有力量的國民造不出有力量的國家，沒有民衆後盾的政府更不能成爲强有力的政府。</p>
<p>大家說，中國民衆毫無組織，好像一盤散沙，這是事實。可是這個事實的責任者，不是民衆，而是政府。我們回想過去一般政府的因為畏懼民衆的力量而設法摧殘，因爲害怕民衆的組織而設法分散。一切的一切，只是領導民衆走上無爲，消極，頹廢的途徑。結果是毀了自已，毀了民衆，毀了國家。這是中國政治上最嚴重的疾病。現在，這個政治病，如果再不想法子醫治，他的影響將不僅是中國本身，而是整個東亞全體；不僅是東亞的現在，更是東亞的將來。所以目前中國民衆力量的集中，和中國民衆的組織，是整個中國整個東亞刻不容緩的工作。</p>
<p>任何組織的目的，都是合作，任何合作的目的，都是求生。所以，組織民衆的目的，簡單地說，就是民衆用合作的方法，謀民衆的生存。生存是人類的願望，用集團方法求生存，更是人類所願意的工作。所以我們敢說，假如政府鼓勵民衆有組織，那末，組織民衆並不是一件難事。民衆組織唯一的困難，並不是民衆本身的不願意組織，而在乎民衆組織的沒有力量。民衆組織沒有力量謀民衆的生存，誰願意參加這個組織？沒有力量的民衆組織，那裏能夠組織民衆？</p>
<p>我們現在謹敢正吿當局，假如要中國民衆有組織，就應該先使中國民衆的組織有力量，無論盟邦和中國，政府當局應該尊重中國民衆的組織，應該幫助中國民衆的組織謀民衆的福利。換句話說，政府應當加强民衆組織的力量。道樣，中國的民衆組織方才發生力量。這樣，中國的民衆自然能夠組織起來。民衆組織應該是自願的，不是强迫的。民衆組織應該是一個凝合的集團，不是混合的一羣烏合之衆。組織民衆不是一篇宣言和幾句口號所能了事的工作，組織民衆是腳踏實地，深入民間，謀民衆切身福利的工作。</p>
<p>孫中山先生遺囑指導我們，「必須喚起民衆，聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬭。」今年是大東亞戰爭的決戰年，是我們聯合東亞民族共同奮　的最重要時期。我們願意提出這個組織中國民衆問題，希望大家切實注意。</p>

<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大本營十八日下午四時半發表：　帝國海軍機隊，海上部隊及地上部隊，曾於十七日上午邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機約二百架，當即擊落其一百另二架（內有十七架未經證實），即被帝國海軍機隊擊落者，計有八十七架（內有十七架未經證實），被帝國海上部隊及地上部隊擊落者，計有十五架，是役我方除有船舶二艘沉失外，別無損失。　帝國海軍機隊曾於一月十四日在拉巴爾空戰中，收獲莫大戰果，已予發表，事後查明是日帝國海上部隊及地上部隊曾擊落敵機三十四架，擊毀敵機二十架，故補誌於茲。</p>
<p>東京丁八日中央社電　日大本營十八日發表敵機羣二百架十四日曾空襲拉巴爾，結果被日機擊落半數以上，而獲得輝煌之戰虹，同時並追加發表十五日於拉巴爾空戰中，日陸海軍機所獲之戰果，又十七日上午敵以巨人型，陶格拉斯型，坂流斯塔型，科其斯型等艦載轟炸機約六十架，燕氏（B－26）轟炸機約廿架，大剪式（P－38）型機約七十架，（F－4－W）式約卅架，（F－4－F）及（F－6－F）式約廿架，合計約二百架之戰鬥轟炸聯合大編隊，轟炸拉巴爾，是時日陸海軍機羣亦起而迎擊，雙方遂展開壯烈之空戰，激戰良久後，日海軍機以迅雷不及掩耳之速度，突然攻入敵機羣中，敵機於倉惶狀態中，歲被擊落八十七架，海陸軍陸地防空部隊及海上部隊均相互呼應，開砲猛轟，擊落敵機十五架，日陸海空軍三位一體，緊密協力，使來襲敵機二百架之半數百零二架葬於海底。茲誌日軍各部隊擊落敵機數目如次：（甲）海軍機擊落敵機計艦載轟炸機十六架（內八架未經證實），（P－三八）型機四十G　架（內五架未經證實），（F－4－W）型敵機二十四架（內二架未經證實），（F－4F）型機及（F6F）型機六架（內二架未經證實），海軍陸地各部隊擎落敵機計艦載機十五架。又日海軍戰鬥機隊於是役中未曾犧牲一架，僅有船舶二艘被炸沉，當敵機來襲時，日海軍戰鬥機隊即衝入敵機編隊中，與之展開混戰後，當即擊落敵機八十七架，獲得光輝戰果，日海軍機戰鬥技術之高妙，敵人爲之震服矣。又十四日之拉巴爾空戰中，日海陸各部隊共擊落敵機三十四架，擊毀其二十桀內中被海上部隊擊落者計十三架，地上防空砲火擊落者計二十一架，敵機被毀之二十架，則全爲海上部隊所獲戰果，計來襲敵機爲百六十二架，而被擊落九十九架，被擊毀二十架，日空軍實力之雄偉於此可見矣。</p>

<h3>締結軍事協定　三週年紀念　日德間互祝勝利</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　德國駐日大使館空軍隨從武官格羅諾少將，頃以十八日爲日·德·義軍事協定三周年紀念日，特於上午十時偕同輔佐官奈米茲上校，赴日本陸軍航空本部·訪問航空總監安田中將，互致寒喧，互祝勝利，茲分誌其致詞如次：（格羅諾少將致詞要旨）開戰以來，日·德空軍於東西兩洋陸續收獲共同作戰之效果，就中日本空軍之殊　，尤令德人稱嘆不置。吾人瞻仰貴國現下航空工業，常　　其生產量之大，與組織之異常進步，於技術方面，更見到貴國生產技師及軍需產業戰士，正以不弱於前綫將士之精神，順利展開對敵之技術戰生產戰，期望隨戰局之進展。日·德兩國軍於同一戰塲，擊潰共同之敵英美，相信該日即爲兩國無敵空軍共同擊減敵英美之日，於茲謹祝日德兩國於緊密之聯繫下，走向勝利途徑，並對日空軍之光輝發展致敬。（安田航空總監答辭要旨）二年前之今日，貴國與敝國締軍事協定，爲擊滅英美，建設世界新秩序·日德兩國刻正展開並肩作戰，其間，貴國空軍於歐洲戰塲曾屢樹勝績，吾人實不勝贊佩，貴國國民於敵空軍殘暴普遍之轟炸下，毫不渙散，必勝信念，愈益堅固，而軍需工廠，非但不懼空襲威脅，且更逐步擴充，實益感貴國戰鬥力量之偉大。貴國與吾國間，基於軍事協定，曾相互就空軍技術資材等作種種交換，此在兩國空軍作戰上，正顯露其效果，洵堪同慶，敵英美之新銳機，於兩國緊密提携下，已不足恐懼，希望今後兩國空軍携手，步向最後勝利。</p>
<h3>菲政府　設置情報局</h3>

<h3>日計劃趕造　電波兵器</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　隨戰爭之逐日熾烈，交戰各國於新兵器之研究亦愈趨昇化，緣此次大戰係以科學爲其戰質，故谷國之科學技術者，亦竭力發揮其威力，其中對於電波兵器之整備與增强，更致異常之努力。日本當局鑒於現下戰局之急需，故計劃急速生產大量電波兵器，並養成優秀之技術人員，通信院等關係機關曾協議設立之航空學專門學校，即爲緊急養成是種人員之機關·該校之設置計劃，以培養國家之技術人才，確立日本科學技術爲目的，其大綱如次：技術程度計分爲大學程度，專門學校程度及中等程度三種，而併行·長期及短期之人材養成，以應現在及將來之需求，對於短期之養成機構，設立電波兵器技術鍊成所，以三閱月或一年養成。</p>
<h3>北京通訊　紙荒聲中　報紙實行合併  雲飛</h3>
<p>北京大閳紙荒，現在是一百張最平常的稿紙巳經價値聯鈔十元以上了。就是手紙，三四月前一綑也不過三五六毛，現在却漲到二元餘了。影響所及，書價大增，一部商務印書館的中國人名大字典，春天在東安市塲書攤上要價二十五元，尙覺得貴，現在是一百元都買不到。在此情形之下我們可以看到幾種現象：</p>
<p>好多時候了，在北京舖子裏買東西，紙匣子是要另外出錢買的，而有的補十却　　不給紙包。</p>
<p>一般字畫舖的劣等　畫都被收買去造紙，書畫價也因之上漲。春天一張索價不過二千元的畫，前些日子却以五千元實價售出。最近海上張姓某收藏家來此搜購古畫，竟以十萬元購得絹本元趙孟　畫一幅。</p>
<p>報紙的停刋也是最近由政府方面决定的。自民國三十三年一月一日起，北京只有三種報紙發行，新民報，小實報與民衆報，其他的報紙如晨報新北京報等都停刋。這說起來，却是正當的措置，因爲近日各報所登的消息類多大同小異，實在沒有多刊的必要。當局對於各報館的同仁，而且有適當的措置，一部分的人員就安插在新，實，民三個報館裏，其失業者則分發遣散費。據說新北京報的遣散費就有二萬元。二萬元雖是小數，但也可以表現當局的注視了。（一月八日密）</p>

<h3>蘇波國境糾紛　蘇態度強硬　倫敦大爲衝動</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　波闌亡命政權關於蘇波國境糾紛問題，前曾發表極度妥協之聲明，然政府突於十七日正午由塔斯社表明强硬態度，反軸心陣營極感衝動。蘇政府於聲明中根本否認波亡命政權之提案，謂蘇波兩國無外交關係，該國境綫問題云者，全係亡命政權欲欺瞞世界輿論之策動云云，故英政界對蘇聯此種強硬態度，亦驚愕不置。據倫敦來電，路透社外交記者尼爾謂英政府當局對蘇政府聲明內容極表遺憾，友其波亡命政權正以和協態度與反軸心陣營取一致行動，而蘇政府忽有此等態度實屬憾事。</p>

<h3>第三方面軍　復員周年紀念　在濟南舉行慶祝儀式</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　第三方面車總司令吳化文上將，於一年前參加和平陣營，迄昨（十八）日巳屆一週年，軍司令部爲慶祝復員一週年，特於十八日，在濟南舉行慶祝儀式，並由吳總司令化文於是日晚七時四十分在濟南對全國廣播。又陸軍部長葉蓬氏，亦於同時在中央電合舉行廣播，茲錄葉部長及吳總司令廣播詞於後：</p>
<p>葉氏廣播</p>
<p>葉陸軍部長廣播大意如下：吳化文總司令是全國軍人之模範，我輩軍人，惟有充分認眞做事，並具有正確之思想，方能達到預期之目的，去年今日以前，吳德司令感覺拖延戰爭之非計，更受汪主一席偉大人格之感召，毅然於去年今日率部來歸，効忠和運，一年來吳將軍所部在防次一帶與共黨苦　，獲得顯著戰果，其精神實足使吾人感　。此後余盼吳總司令所部更加强努力，爲和運而奮　，以達到興復中華保衛東亞之使命。</p>
<p>吳氏廣播</p>
<p>吳化文　播大意，　謂今天是第三方面軍奉命腹員的第一個週年紀念，也就是兄弟與十數年來同甘苦共生死的四萬弟兄們獻身的運的第一個週年紀念，我們要想達到根絕共匪的目的，必在服從我們最高領袖汪委員長三分軍事，七分政治的訓示，方能夠澈底的成功。</p>
<p>復興中華與保衛東亞，這兩個偉大歷史任務，無論如何，是絕對不可分開的，也是絕對不能分開的，「肅政思想」與「保障治安」以及「增加生產」這三個重點工作，在關連性上也是一樣的。今後第三方面軍的工作決遵最高領袖汪委員長「决戰第一」的訓示，而踏盟邦將士有進無退的前這，一心一德，整齊步調，向着復興中華，保衛東亞，協力大東亞戰爭的歷史新路邁進。</p>
<h3>立法院通過　建設公債案</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　立法院十八日召開九四次會議，主席陳院長，秘書長彭羲明，（秘書張國仁代），（甲）報吿事項。（略）（乙）討論事項，　本院財政經濟法制三委員會會同審查建設公債一案，决議，照審查修正案修正通過，十二時十分議畢散會。</p>
<p>南太平洋</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的本質，是日美的太平洋戰爭，而太平洋的决戰塲是南太平洋，這不但現在如此，將來亦然。日本的戰力，以南方的資源與日本本王的工業力兩要素之綜合爲根本，敵方作戰的目標，也在打破這均衡。但以工業力中樞日本本土爲目標的中都太平洋反攻，尙遠在二千數百　之外的吉爾伯特島，而從北方的阿留申，中國大陸的空中前來攻擊，也不能不在意料之中。僅賴空襲不能在工業力上給與致命傷，此在德英二國的例子上也可以明白。所以敵方的戰爭努力，另一個要素是在遮斷日本取得南方資源的石油，精鋁，橡膠等，想由此而在日本的戰力上給與致命傷。突入敵戰略圈，制壓這蠢動的，是以拉巴爾爲頂點，結連所羅門，新幾尼亞的日軍三角形戰略圈。</p>
<h3>太平洋戰局的展望</h3>
<p>一年半以來，敵美國不顧艦艇，飛機，兵員的消耗，反覆前來突擊，想覆滅拉巴爾戰略圈。敵方企圖奪回拉巴爾之後，解除南方兵站綫的威脅，幷由此蠶食荷印及其他重要實源地帶。現在敵方先在新不列顛島的馬加斯岬，格洛斯泰岬二地佔領橋頭堡，設定飛機塲，以之爲攻擊拉巴爾的立脚點，正在日陸海空軍的猛襲下，以年代悠久的森林爲舞台，與白軍守備隊苦戰中。</p>
<p>然而我們必須知道，敵人雖在接近拉巴爾的地方登陸，但新不列顛島有叢山峻嶺，森林密佈，機動部隊由陸上進擊是不可能的。而這地點的補給及以此爲基地而出擊，不能不靠海路。所以在離拉巴爾四·五百公里的馬加斯，格洛斯泰岬登陸，在戰略的價値上，與登陸四百公里外的波根維爾島特洛基那岬，四百九十公里外的托洛白利安特島，五百公里外的格多那夫島並無很大的差異，不必徒抱杞憂。不過像南太平洋這樣島嶼密佈，無論那一為都變成彼此航空基地化的戰塲，制空威力圈如犬牙之相錯，並沒有一方面的制空權，是所謂「半制空權」下的决戰塲。且因陸路交通的不便，對作戰部隊的補充增援，除少數可以從空中投下物資，糧食的例外之外，是不能不用海路艦艇的特殊戰塲，是「半制空權下的補充決戰」，這就是南太平洋現戰局的狀况。要在這戰爭中獲得勝利，最急要的擴大制空威力的飛機，其次是作補充用船舶。</p>
<p>印度洋</p>
<p>敵艦隊在印度洋已經集結了相當勢力。據去年十二月十七日波森日報上所載摩阿基茲倍爾格德海軍大佐的觀測「有主力艦七至八艘，航空母艦五艘，重巡洋艦八艘，輕巡洋艦八艘，此外另有驅逐艦及其他補助艦艇多數」其數量足以在海上一戰。且在最近東南亞洲戰綫上統一英空軍及美航空隊，任命李却特，披阿斯爲司令官，並强化對北部孟加拉灣的哨戒，集積軍需資材，增加對印度洋各港船舶的出入，此方面敵方的行動。正在漸趨活潑。這樣，印度洋的戰雲也正似暴風雨前夕一樣的寂靜，醞釀着重大的變化。後方人民，正應該整備鐵桶般的態勢，各在自己的本位上努力，以求戰，勝，（完）（翔：譯自一月一日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>戶口米本月下旬起　增配為二升半　糧食調整會委員長發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　上海糧食配給調整委員會委員長紀華，爲逐步增配市民食米事發表談話如次：查上海糧貪配給調整委員會，係上海特別市中日民食米統籌配發之最高管理機構，其組成分子，包括上海糧食局，日本大使館農林　，日本總領事館經濟課，第一區公署經濟處，米糧統制委員會等各機關，其工作目的在解决此民生根本之食糧問題，求供應之圓滿。近來由於中日軍官民之協力與援助，對於調整配給確保來源，巳獲極大把握，尤以米統會及其下層機構努力之結果，收買及遝輸均有顯著之進展，爲至堪慶賀之一大快事。其成效則使配給市民之戶口米，自一月中旬起，由一升遞增至二升，近更在一月下旬增配至最高基準之每旬二升半，並爲上等白米，際此奮歷新正，在民生安定上，獲致雙重之喜悅。同時麵粉配給，不特能維持每旬一市斤之基準，並有增配之傾向，糧局方面，以往愆期之粉，且亦併期配出，民生間題，已具解决端倪，本人得有此機會向市民諸君，報吿此喜訊，深感愉快。同時亟盼我市民諸君，深切了解米糧收買配給以及政府取締黑市之種種困難。在此環境之下，必須勵行節約，以保物資供應之圓滑。又配給之數量前途，大致總可保持目前之水準，惟望市民共同努力，以協助當局抑壓黑市，俾維民生。此外與食糧發生密切關係之燃料問題，當局亦已有詳盡之規劃，施行配給，黑市之消滅，自不成問題矣。</p>
<p>煤球特別配給增配一個月量</p>
<p>中央社訊　本市煤斤之供求關係，自去　底以來，略起失調，當局乃即實施限制煤斤消費，致一部份市民，驟起恐慌，發生種種臆測，然自本年以來，華北方面煤斤輸入，極爲順利，除重要產業方面，陸續配給外，即一般家庭用煤前途，亦極堪樂觀。常局鑒於舊正爲日已近，一般對於燃料需要，自當較殷，故决於最近期內，實施煤球以及其他燃料之特別配給，煤球一項，除普通配量之外，將特別增配一個月量，目下煤球恐慌情形，當可因之大見減輕。</p>
<h3>本市刋物登記證歸　宣傳部核發　未呈準前絕對不準出版</h3>

<h3>評言　華股應當看作什麽？</h3>
<p>農曆年關雖已迫在眼前，而華商股票却仍在一片買風中呈其欣欣向榮之態，這不能不說是戰時上海經濟界的一個良好現象，因爲證券交易的繁榮，最有助於都市經濟的繁榮，那是毋庸置辯的。可是，這裏所謂繁榮，絕不是指證券市塲中一切不合於常態的熱鬧情况，有如發行股票者之百計拉抬，經營股票者之大踢皮球，買賣股票者之亂搶帽子，那簡直是把華股當作賭具使用了，絕不是華股正常指標。</p>
<p>華股應常看作什麼？我們的答復是：華股應常看作發展民族企業，擴充生產資金的正當途徑。戰時一個國家的戰費」及生產資金，是靠許許多多方法來籌措的，但是，在擴充生產資金部門上，投資於國內各項生產證券，實爲人民公衆最當採取之途徑，其積極的作用，爲强化戰時增加生產的力量。而其消極的作用，則爲消化民間零星的浮動購買力，也可以說是一穢最安全的貯蓄。今年的一年爲增產年，我們熱烈期望其同時爲華股年，因爲華股的正常發展是與增產前途具有密切聯繫的。</p>
<h3>銀錢業禁止　華股塲外交易</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會，頃奉財政部令，自華商證券交易所復業後，凡華商股票之買賣，均應集中於該所交易，絕對不得私自塲外交易。查銀錢業依照規定業務，得代客買賣有似證券，惟是項證券之買賣，必須由交易所經紀人經手辦理交易，聞該兩業公會已通吿會員行莊遵照辦理。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　盼望取消使用病車之限制  子芳</h3>
<p>爲大衆解除痛苦，爲社會謀致福利的施策或措置，才謂之善政；善政者，福國利民，凡百設施，人民總是異常熱烈的擁護與贊助的。像第一區公署消防處所設置的專爲病家服務的病房病車，經歷年之經心研究與不斷之改進，不僅設備周全，服務認眞；並能迎合病家之心理，適應病情之需要，而病車上之侍役，俱都經過相富之訓練，對付病家溫文有禮，和藹可親，病房病車在滬上堪稱手屈一指，凡用過該病車者，無不交相讚譽。</p>
<p>先前，無論誰何，只要是病家或產婦，行動艱難，由家就醫院或由醫院返家，不拘何時，深夜，白盡，一個電話隨喚隨到，旣迅速又簡便。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭發生以後，爲了節省物力，使用病車遂受了極嚴格的限制，必須經正式登記過之醫師召喚，並簽給證明書，方可准其使用，，否則，槪遭拒絕，這樣一來，一般病患者咸感覺極度之不便，緣大凡使用病車，必屬病勢沉重，行動不得，艱於步履，急於送院調治，刻不容綏，或產婦腹起隆隆，頻於臨　，三輪車，黃包車位狹不穩，且四處冒風，稍一不愼，寒邪一乘虛而入，就有性命之堪一虞！且在病情迫急，瀕於危殆之際，舉家惶惑，唯冀立時送院就醫，何暇東奔西跑央求醫師簽給證書，然後再電話召喚，即至病車到臨，而病患者，恐怕亦壽終正寢了！</p>
<p>按病房病車之設置，原爲造福病家減輕痛苦，救人危厄，以服務社會爲宗旨，若限制綦嚴，致使危難者不能應用；這樣與設置病車之原意，寗不背道而馳，不但玩忽人命，實非所以厚福市民。</p>
<p>因之我們竭誠希望消坊當局，爲顧全病家苦痛與便利，及貫澈其為大衆服務之初衷，迅速撤消限制，要知救病人於瀕危與救火有同等的重要與迫切！無論情勢如何，絕不應有所限制，病人送往醫院救治或療養，亟應隨喚隨到，不宜故意延遲或留難，若嫌車費過廉，不妨酌量增加，總以不傷市民元氣爲至要。如此，不但德及病苦，減少死亡，而凡屬病患者，亦莫不荷感！（却酬）</p>
<h3>海軍立志（八）  岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</h3>
<p>兵器工廠的集成館，也被破壞了，民家的什物，也被燒掉了。正在市民大混亂的當中，七月二日已經過去，到了第二天，風雨的猛勢漸殺，正在此時，英國艦隊，終於開始退却了。他們的進路，正是眞人和龍夫，每天玩耍的天保山和海上小島的中間。</p>
<p>海上小島，也有砲臺。守衛此島的將士們，因在昨天的戰鬥中，一砲未發，正在摩拳擦掌，迫不及待。這兒的砲豪長是呌着靑山愚痴的怪姓名，是舊式天山流的砲術家，因英艦從小島的對方前來，所以一面用手撫摸着圓形的砲彈，「今天要辛苦你了，」這樣地向砲彈拜託着。</p>
<p>並且，還有一個可喜的期待。就是在海上的小島，和燃崎的中間，埋了三個中原猶介製造的帶有電氣的敷設水雷。英艦隊的進路，正指着那個方向，若再少耐一刻，便會發生效果，而從性急的海上小島的砲臺，巳經開始了砲火。英艦急遽轉向，退至神瀨方面，猛烈地開始應戰。擊中了的一彈，使在砲臺上的井上直入負了重傷。直八後更名良　，也是拜受元帥之位的。</p>
<p>回顧　英戰爭的時候，要使我們感到這次的戰爭，實在是元帥和名將的搖籃。大山·川村·野津·西鄕·東鄕·伊東·井十諸元帥層出，其中除去三位是陸軍，以外都是　軍出身·再是仁禮景範，赤塚源六，伊集院　　等，實獻於日本海軍的人物，俱都參加了這次的戰役。如山本權兵衛大將，僅只十二歲，未得直接參加戰爭，而也在後方搬運砲彈，間接的參加了戰爭。由是觀之，薩英戰爭，非但寄與薩　藩的刺激甚大，而使日本人對於海軍的思想，掀起了軒然大波。</p>
<p>那暫且不提，英艦退到小根占的海上，完成應急的修整後，又航行至橫濱。於是戰爭吿了結束，但雙方的死傷者，確意外的稀少。英方死者十三名，負傷五十名，薩摩軍死者只有一人，而傷者不過六人。</p>
<p>從這個結果上看來，薩摩方面，好像是戰勝了，但事實絕不是這樣的·不但各砲合和集成館工廠，都受了極大的損害，而秘茲不出的蒸氣商船三隻，也被燒掉了。</p>
<p>總而言之，是未分勝負的戰爭。至少軍艦對砲台的戰爭，薩摩方面，是輸一籌的。並且，精神上也不得不感到一種重壓的。</p>
<p>那就是對英國軍艦和大砲的，驚奇的初開眼界。二千三百餘噸，遵率十一節的軍艦，和飛射圓錐形砲彈的。埃姆斯脫朗砲的威力，對敵人之優越，而感到自己的劣等。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>切望熱心人士　創辦夜課大學</h3>
<p>我是一個高中畢業生，因環境的逼迫與經濟的限制，使我不得不離開學校，而走向社會。然而這對於我是一件多麼傷心的事呀！雖然奮鬥了幾次，結果皆碰釘子，無法，便由於親戚的介紹，就在一家洋行中服務，做我所不顧做的事。但是求智之欲仍未消滅，所以每月節省，尙能有餘，預備繼續升入大學，然而時間又成了問題。我又不能放棄工作不幹，因此常常爲此煩惱，不樂，我相信目今一定有許多靑年也正爲此痛苦。希望諸位慈善的敎育家來可憐可憐這般靑年，爲他們前途着想，多多設立夜課大學，一切課程與日課無異，若時間不够分配，寗可星期日也照當上踝，盼望速能成功。（子華）</p>

        <h1>1944.01.19</h1>
<h3>Organize the Masses</h3>
<p>Recently, whether from the Chinese side or the Allied side, there has been a considerable understanding of the strength of the Chinese people. This is a good phenomenon. Following the emphasis on the strength of the people is the issue of concentrating the strength of the people, that is, the issue of organizing the people. The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun said on January 4th: "If the people are not gathered and organized, the National Government absolutely cannot extend its political power and implement its policies. If the policies of the National Government are not implemented, then the rise of fighting spirit and the increase of production will naturally be impossible, and therefore it will not be possible to contribute to the war." This is truly insightful! We have long believed that the foundation of the country lies in politics, and the foundation of politics lies in the people. Those engaged in politics should know that first, the people of the whole country must have strength, and then the country can have great strength. A nation without strength cannot create a strong country, and a government without the support of the people cannot become a powerful government.</p>
<p>Everyone says that the Chinese people are not organized at all, like a heap of loose sand. This is a fact. But the responsibility for this fact lies not with the people, but with the government. We recall that in the past, governments in general tried to destroy the strength of the people because they feared it, and tried to disperse the organization of the people because they were afraid of it. Everything, everything, just led the people down the path of inaction, negativity, and decadence. The result was the destruction of themselves, the destruction of the people, and the destruction of the country. This is the most serious disease in Chinese politics. Now, if this political disease is not treated, its impact will not only be on China itself, but on the entire East Asia; not only on the present of East Asia, but also on the future of East Asia. Therefore, the concentration of the strength of the Chinese people and the organization of the Chinese people are urgent tasks for the entire China and the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>The purpose of any organization is cooperation, and the purpose of any cooperation is survival. Therefore, the purpose of organizing the people, simply put, is for the people to use cooperative methods to seek the survival of the people. Survival is the desire of mankind, and seeking survival through group methods is even more a work that mankind is willing to do. Therefore, we dare to say that if the government encourages the people to organize, then organizing the people is not a difficult task. The only difficulty in organizing the people is not the people's unwillingness to organize, but the lack of strength in the people's organization. If the people's organization does not have the strength to seek the survival of the people, who would be willing to join this organization? How can a powerless people's organization organize the people?</p>
<p>We now dare to formally inform the authorities that if you want the Chinese people to be organized, you should first make the Chinese people's organization powerful. Whether it is the Allies or China, the government authorities should respect the Chinese people's organization and should help the Chinese people's organization seek the welfare of the people. In other words, the government should strengthen the strength of the people's organization. In this way, the Chinese people's organization will have power. In this way, the Chinese people will naturally be able to organize. The people's organization should be voluntary, not forced. The people's organization should be a cohesive group, not a mixed mob. Organizing the people is not a work that can be accomplished with a declaration and a few slogans. Organizing the people is a work of being down-to-earth, going deep into the people, and seeking the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will guides us, "We must awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together." This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, and it is the most important period for us to unite with the East Asian nations to fight together. We are willing to raise this issue of organizing the Chinese people, and hope that everyone will pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the Skies Over Rabaul - Japanese Army Achieves Glorious Victory - Imperial Headquarters Announces 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 18th: The Imperial Navy Air Force, naval units, and ground forces encountered approximately 200 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul on the morning of the 17th and immediately shot down 102 of them (including 17 unconfirmed).

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced on the 18th that a group of 200 enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul on the 14th, resulting in more than half being shot down by Japanese aircraft, achieving a brilliant victory. At the same time, it additionally announced the results of the air battle over Rabaul on the 15th by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces. On the morning of the 17th, approximately 60 carrier-based bombers such as giant types, Douglas types, Brewster types, and Curtiss types, approximately 20 B-26 bombers, approximately 70 P-38 fighter planes, approximately 30 F-4-W types, and approximately 20 F-4-F and F-6-F types, totaling approximately 200 aircraft, launched a joint combat-bombing large formation to bomb Rabaul. At that time, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces also rose to meet them, and the two sides launched a fierce air battle. After a long and intense battle, the Japanese Navy Air Force suddenly broke into the enemy aircraft formation with lightning speed. The enemy aircraft were in a state of panic and 87 were shot down. The Navy and Army land air defense units and naval units echoed each other, opening fire and bombarding fiercely, shooting down 15 enemy aircraft. The Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, three in one, cooperated closely, causing half of the 200 invading enemy aircraft, 102 in total, to be buried at the bottom of the sea. The number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Japanese forces is as follows: (A) The Navy Air Force shot down 16 carrier-based bombers (8 unconfirmed), 40 P-38 aircraft (5 unconfirmed), 24 F-4-W enemy aircraft (2 unconfirmed), and 6 F-4F and F6F aircraft (2 unconfirmed). Naval land units shot down 15 carrier-based aircraft. Furthermore, the Japanese Navy fighter squadron did not sacrifice a single aircraft in this battle, only two ships were sunk. When the enemy aircraft attacked, the Japanese Navy fighter squadron rushed into the enemy aircraft formation and engaged in a melee, immediately shooting down 87 enemy aircraft, achieving a glorious victory. The superb combat skills of the Japanese Navy aircraft have impressed the enemy. Furthermore, in the air battle over Rabaul on the 14th, the Japanese Army and Navy forces shot down a total of 34 enemy aircraft and destroyed 20. Of these, 13 were shot down by the naval units and 21 were shot down by ground air defense artillery fire. All 20 enemy aircraft destroyed were the result of naval units. A total of 162 enemy aircraft attacked, and 99 were shot down and 20 were destroyed. The magnificent strength of the Japanese Air Force can be seen here.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Reserve Officer Kino and Others Promoted Two Ranks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - On June 23rd of last year, when sixteen enemy unified-type B24 aircraft divided into several groups and strafed Japanese warships and warehouse areas docked in Makassar Harbor, Naval Reserve Lieutenant Kino Yuji, accompanied by reconnaissance officer Chief Petty Officer Manabe Tsuruo, bravely used a single attack aircraft on the ground to break into the enemy formation, directly charging the enemy commander's aircraft from the front and shooting it down. At the same time, his own aircraft also bravely self-destructed, desperately crushing the enemy's attempt and demonstrating the true spirit of the Imperial Navy. Lieutenant Kino and Petty Officer Manabe were awarded commendations by the Commander of the Combined Fleet. Recently, their heroic deeds were reported to the Emperor and they were granted the honor of being promoted two ranks. Regarding this, the Ministry of the Navy announced the following at 0:00 AM on January 19th: Promoting two ranks is the fifth time since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and this is the first time that a reserve officer from a student background has been given the honor of promoting two ranks. This time, the following personnel are bestowed with the honor of promotion by two ranks: Naval Reserve Lieutenant Ono Yuji is appointed Naval Reserve Lieutenant Commander, Order of Merit 4th Class, Rising Sun 6th Class. Naval Petty Officer 2nd Class Manabe Tsuruo is appointed Naval Petty Officer 1st Class, Order of Merit 5th Class, Rising Sun 7th Class.</p>
<h3>Enhancing Wartime Finance - Japan Levies Indirect Taxes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The large tax increase plan (amended laws in the Income Tax and other 29 laws) for direct and indirect taxes of 2.2 billion yen in the initial year and 2.5 billion yen in the current year, which was submitted by the current session of the Japanese Diet, and the detailed content of the amended laws related to direct taxes, income tax, and 16 legal bills, was also announced by the Ministry of Finance on the 18th. This time, the indirect tax-related amendment plan includes taxes on alcohol, soft drinks, sugar consumption, textile consumption, goods, entertainment and dining, admission, special acts, advertising, dominoes, and stamp duty.

The estimated increase in indirect taxes this time is 823 million yen in the initial year and 883 million yen in the current year.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Ambon - Three Shot Down</h3>
<p>Ambon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Six enemy four-engine bombers attacked Ambon on the afternoon of the 16th. The Japanese Navy fighter planes immediately intercepted them and destroyed three. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Military Agreement Concluded - 3rd Anniversary - Japan and Germany Congratulate Each Other on Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Major General Grono, Air Force Attaché of the German Embassy in Japan, considering the 18th to be the 3rd anniversary of the Japan-Germany-Italy Military Agreement, went to the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters at 10:00 AM accompanied by his assistant Colonel Nemitz to visit General Anada, Director-General of Aviation, to exchange greetings and congratulate each other on victory. The content of his speech is as follows: (Main points of Major General Grono's speech) Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese and German air forces have successively achieved the results of joint operations in the East and West Oceans. Among them, the outstanding achievements of the Japanese Air Force have made the Germans marvel. We admire your country's current aviation industry, and often praise its large production volume and extraordinary organizational progress. In terms of technology, we have seen that your country's production technicians and munitions industry soldiers are smoothly developing a technical warfare production war against the enemy with a spirit no weaker than that of the soldiers on the front line. We expect that with the progress of the war, the Japanese and German armies will defeat the common enemy, the United States and Britain, in the same battlefield. I believe that day will be the day when the two countries' invincible air forces jointly defeat the enemy, the United States and Britain. Here, I wish Japan and Germany to march towards victory under close ties, and pay tribute to the glorious development of the Japanese Air Force. (Main points of General Yasuda's reply) Two years ago today, your country and our country concluded a military agreement. In order to destroy the United States and Britain and build a new world order, Japan and Germany are now launching a shoulder-to-shoulder battle. During this period, your country's air force has repeatedly achieved victories in the European battlefield. We are truly in admiration. Your country's people are not dispersed at all under the enemy air force's brutal and universal bombing, and their belief in victory is even more strengthened. And the munitions factories, not only are they not afraid of the threat of air raids, but they are also gradually expanding. I truly feel the greatness of your country's fighting power. Your country and our country have made various exchanges on air force technology and materials based on the military agreement. This is showing its effect in the operations of the two countries' air forces, which is truly commendable. The enemy's new aircraft from the United States and Britain are no longer to be feared under the close cooperation between the two countries. I hope that the air forces of the two countries will join hands and move towards final victory.</p>
<h3>Philippine Government - Establishes Information Bureau</h3>
<p>Manila, 18th (Central News Agency) - The establishment of the Information Bureau by the Philippine government was announced on the 18th.

<h3>Japan Plans to Rush Manufacture of Radio Wave Weapons</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - As the war becomes increasingly fierce day by day, research on new weapons by the warring countries is also becoming increasingly advanced. Because this war is based on science as its essence, scientists and technicians of various countries are also exerting their power to the fullest. Among them, the maintenance and enhancement of radio wave weapons is receiving abnormal effort. The Japanese authorities, in view of the urgent needs of the current war situation, are planning to rapidly produce a large number of radio wave weapons and train excellent technical personnel. The Aviation Academy established through the agreement of the Communications Institute and other related agencies is an agency for the emergency training of such personnel. The establishment plan of the school aims to cultivate the country's technical talents and establish Japanese science and technology. The outline is as follows: The technical level is divided into three types: university level, vocational school level, and secondary level, which are carried out in parallel. Long-term and short-term personnel training are carried out to meet the needs of the present and the future. For short-term training institutions, a radio wave weapon technology training center will be established, with a training period of three months or one year.</p>
<h3>Beijing Correspondence - Amidst the Paper Shortage - Newspapers Implement Mergers - Yun Fei</h3>
<p>Beijing is facing a serious paper shortage. Currently, 100 sheets of the most ordinary draft paper already cost more than ten yuan in joint currency. Even toilet paper, which cost only three, five, or six mao per bundle three or four months ago, has now risen to more than two yuan. As a result, book prices have increased dramatically. A Chinese Biographical Dictionary from the Commercial Press, which was priced at twenty-five yuan at a book stall in Dong'an Market in the spring, still felt expensive, but now you can't buy it for one hundred yuan. Under these circumstances, we can see several phenomena:</p>
<p>For a long time, when buying things in shops in Beijing, you have to pay extra for the paper box, and some shops don't even give you paper wrapping.</p>
<p>Inferior paintings from general calligraphy and painting shops have been bought up to make paper, and the price of calligraphy and painting has also risen as a result. A painting that cost no more than two thousand yuan in the spring recently sold for five thousand yuan. Recently, a collector surnamed Zhang from Shanghai came here to search for ancient paintings and bought a silk Zhao Mengfu painting from the Yuan Dynasty for one hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The suspension of newspapers was also recently decided by the government. From January 1, 1944, only three newspapers will be published in Beijing: Xinmin Bao, Xiaoshi Bao, and Minzhong Bao. Other newspapers such as Chen Bao and Xin Beijing Bao will be suspended. This, in fact, is a proper measure, because the news published in various newspapers recently is mostly the same, and there is really no need to publish so many. The authorities also have appropriate measures for colleagues from various newspaper offices. Some of the staff have been placed in the three newspaper offices of Xin, Shi, and Min, and those who are unemployed will be distributed severance pay. It is said that the severance pay for Xin Beijing Bao is as high as 20,000 yuan. Although 20,000 yuan is a small amount, it can also show the authorities' attention. (Confidential, January 8)</p>

<h3>Japanese National Labor Mobilization - Emergency Guidelines Passed Yesterday - To Adapt to the Needs of the War Situation in the Decisive Period</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on the morning of the 18th. All cabinet members, including Prime Minister Tojo, attended. The main agenda items passed at the meeting included: Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy Outline; Emergency Student Labor Mobilization Outline; Second Type of Industrial Enterprise Consolidation Measures Outline. At the same time, Minister of Finance Kaya also reported on loan incidents to munitions companies, etc.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government decided on the 18th during a cabinet meeting on the Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy Outline and the Emergency Student Labor Mobilization Policy Outline. The content of the outline, which was announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 PM, is to comprehensively, systematically, and urgently and forcefully implement the labor mobilization of the Japanese people to adapt to the needs of the war situation in the decisive period. The outline is as follows:</p>
<h3>Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy</h3>
<p>Expand the scope of the current national registration and establish a national registration system. Expand the scope of implementation of requisitioning the people. In addition to the existing system of requisitioning based on residence, a new system of requisitioning based on war-related industries will be created. The status of those currently requisitioned and the nature of their work, as well as the methods for canceling requisition during the requisition period, will be flexibly applied to suit the environment. Regarding the labor mobilization of women, fully consider the family system, the characteristics of women, and the enhancement of national strength, and promote and expand it. Therefore, enhance the application of the Women's Volunteer Corps system, and strive to adopt a commuting system from the family aspect. Clarify the target rate of female employment in various industries, factories, and businesses, and rapidly expand the scope of female employment. For the sake of proper labor allocation, order local officials to establish labor supply and demand plans for each prefecture to seek suitable and urgently needed personnel. In order to smoothly and actively mobilize national labor, the National Service Association will be the main body to launch a national movement.</p>
<h3>Emergency Mobilization of Student Labor Policy</h3>
<p>Special regulations will be made for factories and businesses where students work to consider the commuting distance, type of discipline, age, and gender. Establish the relationship between the school and the factory, forming an integrated whole. The standard working period is approximately four months out of the year, and they will continue to work for four months. The period may be extended depending on the type of school or discipline. Depending on the situation, factories can be established at the school's location or in school buildings, or materials can be supplied, creating so-called "school factories." The policy is to have students engage in production within the school.</p>
<h3>Tank Battle Unfolds in the Northern Part of the Eastern Front - 21 Divisions of Soviet Infantry Moved to the Front Line</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday, the Soviet army, with a powerful tank force, attacked the area south of Leningrad and Oranienbaum, and again attempted to break through the German lines, but the German army foiled the enemy's attempt in fierce fighting. During the battle, the enemy used 100 tanks to assist, and the German army destroyed 69 of them. Yesterday, the Soviet army lost a total of 91 tanks in this battle area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to the Huitong News Agency, German military officials revealed that between Lake Ilmen and Leningrad in the northern section of the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union dispatched 21 infantry divisions and several strong tank brigades. Among them, there are six infantry divisions and several tank brigades north of Lake Ilmen, two more infantry divisions further north, eight infantry divisions south of Leningrad, and five more infantry divisions in the Oranienbaum area. German military experts speculate that the Soviet authorities are not satisfied with the progress of the Soviet army in the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, so they have increased their troops to assist them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency military reporter Hantorius said: The winter war on the Eastern Front is intensifying. A few days ago, the Soviet army expanded its offensive range south of Velikiye Luki and exerted pressure on other war zones. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in areas where the enemy is attempting to break through. The Soviet army continues to exert pressure north of Lake Ilmen, and also launched offensives north and south-southwest of the city. The Soviet army is still stubbornly resisting the German attempt to break into the Nikopol bridgehead south of Bologoye, but the next day its offensive power weakened.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Actively Preparing to Attack Europe - Braetton Appointed Commander of US Forces</h3>

<h3>General Wilson Discusses the Italian War Situation - The Decisive Period Has Now Begun</h3>
<p>Tangier, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: Wilson, Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Mediterranean, predicted at an intelligence meeting at his headquarters in Algiers yesterday that the Anti-Axis forces could expect to enter Rome in the spring, and strongly stated that the Anti-Axis forces had begun the decisive period, and the military action in Italy aimed to take Rome as the future target of attack. At the same time, he admitted that the recent climate in the Balkans was quite unfavorable for the Anti-Axis forces to risk an offensive. Regarding Eisenhower's belief that the Anti-Axis countries could hope to win this year, when asked if he held the same view, Wilson replied that if fortune helped, we could hope to win this year, but whether we could end the war this year was another matter.</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Attack Southern Germany - Eighteen Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer Headquarters announced: US bomber squadrons attacked southern Germany on the 16th and damaged residential areas in Kula-Boerfurt, causing casualties. German ground artillery fire shot down 18 enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Clark's Troops Approach Cassino</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The 5th Army under General Clark approached Cassino in southern Italy at a heavy price. Behind the city is a huge rock, as high as 1,670 meters. Some US troops have already reached the Rapido River that passes through the city. After the German army withdrew from the Trocciam Mountain ridge, which is about 250 meters high, the famous "Little Gibraltar" has fallen into the hands of the US army, but the progress of the US army is still extremely slow. The roads of the Apennines are muddy due to the melting of permanent snow, and troops and tanks are stuck in the mud, becoming obvious targets for German aircraft. The 8th Army is attempting to deploy imperial troops along the Adriatic coast, but is being blocked by German scouting teams.</p>
<h3>South Pacific Conference - Opens in Australia - Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers Deliver Speeches</h3>

<h3>Border Dispute Between Soviet Union and Poland: Soviet Attitude is Firm, London is Greatly Agitated</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th - Central News Agency: Regarding the border dispute between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet Union, the former had previously issued a statement expressing extreme compromise. However, the Soviet government suddenly adopted a strong stance at noon on the 17th through TASS, greatly agitating the anti-Axis camp. In its statement, the Soviet government fundamentally denied the proposals of the Polish government-in-exile, stating that there were no diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, and that the so-called border issue was entirely a tactic by the government-in-exile to deceive world opinion. Consequently, British political circles were astonished by this tough attitude of the Soviet Union. According to dispatches from London, Reuters diplomatic correspondent Neil stated that British government authorities expressed great regret over the content of the Soviet government's statement, especially as the Polish government-in-exile was adopting a cooperative attitude and taking consistent action with the anti-Axis camp, making the Soviet government's sudden shift regrettable.</p>

<h3>Third Route Army: Anniversary of Reorganization Commemorated: Celebration Ceremony Held in Jinan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th - Central News Agency: General Wu Huawen, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, joined the peace camp one year ago. Yesterday (18th) marked the first anniversary. The Army Headquarters held a celebration ceremony in Jinan on the 18th to celebrate the first anniversary of the reorganization. Commander-in-Chief Wu Huawen broadcast to the nation from Jinan at 7:40 p.m. that day. In addition, Minister of the Army Ye Peng also broadcast simultaneously at the Central Broadcasting Station. The broadcast speeches of Minister Ye and Commander-in-Chief Wu are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ye's Broadcast</p>
<p>The main points of Minister of the Army Ye's broadcast are as follows: Commander-in-Chief Wu Huawen is a model for all soldiers in the country. We soldiers can only achieve our expected goals by doing things diligently and having correct thinking. Before today last year, Commander Wu felt that prolonging the war was not a good plan, and was inspired by Chairman Wang's great personality, resolutely leading his troops to return and be loyal to peace. Over the past year, General Wu's troops have fought hard against the Communists in the defense area and achieved significant results. His spirit is truly admirable. In the future, I hope that Commander-in-Chief Wu's troops will strengthen their efforts and strive for peace, so as to achieve the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Wu's Broadcast</p>
<p>The main points of Wu Huawen's broadcast are: Today is the first anniversary of the Third Route Army's reorganization, and it is also the first anniversary of the dedication to peace by the brothers and 40,000 comrades who have shared weal and woe for more than ten years. If we want to achieve the goal of eradicating the Communist bandits, we must follow the instructions of our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, of "three points of military and seven points of politics" to be completely successful.</p>
<p>The two great historical tasks of revitalizing China and defending East Asia can never be separated. The three key tasks of "purifying political thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" are also the same in terms of relevance. In the future, the work of the Third Route Army will follow the instructions of the supreme leader, Chairman Wang, of "resolute battle first," and follow the allied soldiers who have no retreat, with one heart and one mind, and in orderly steps, to move towards the new historical path of revitalizing China, defending East Asia, and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes National Construction Bond Bill</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th - Central News Agency: The Legislative Yuan held its 94th meeting on the 18th, chaired by President Chen, Secretary-General Peng Ximing, (Secretary Zhang Guoren substituting), (A) Reporting matters. (Omitted) (B) Discussion matters, The Finance, Economics, and Legal System Committees of this Yuan jointly reviewed the National Construction Bond case, and resolved to approve it as amended by the review amendment. The meeting adjourned at 12:10.</p>
<p>South Pacific</p>
<p>The essence of the Greater East Asia War is the Pacific War between Japan and the United States, and the decisive battlefield in the Pacific is the South Pacific. This is not only the case now, but will also be the case in the future. Japan's war power is fundamentally based on the combination of resources from the South and the industrial power of mainland Japan. The enemy's war goal is also to break this balance. However, the Central Pacific counteroffensive targeting the industrial power center of mainland Japan is still far away at Gilbert Island, thousands of miles away. Attacks from the Aleutians in the north and the mainland China in the air cannot be ignored. Air raids alone cannot inflict a fatal blow on industrial power, as can be seen from the examples of Germany and the United Kingdom. Therefore, another element of the enemy's war effort is to cut off Japan's access to resources from the South, such as oil, aluminum, and rubber, hoping to inflict a fatal blow on Japan's war power. Breaking into the enemy's strategic circle and suppressing this movement is the Japanese triangular strategic circle, with Rabaul as its apex, connecting the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>For the past year and a half, the enemy, the United States, has repeatedly launched attacks, regardless of the consumption of ships, aircraft, and personnel, in an attempt to destroy the Rabaul strategic circle. The enemy intends to recapture Rabaul, remove the threat to the southern supply line, and thereby erode the Dutch East Indies and other important resource areas. Currently, the enemy has first occupied bridgeheads at Cape Gloucester and Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island, and established airfields as a foothold for attacking Rabaul. Under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, they are engaged in a bitter battle with the white army garrison in the ancient forests.</p>
<p>However, we must know that although the enemy has landed near Rabaul, New Britain Island has towering mountains, dense forests, and it is impossible for mobile units to advance overland. The supply of this location and the attacks launched from this base must rely on sea routes. Therefore, landing at Cape Gloucester and Cape Gloucester, 400-500 kilometers from Rabaul, is not significantly different in strategic value from landing at Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, 490 kilometers away, Torlop Island, 500 kilometers away, and Gudonaff Island. There is no need to worry unnecessarily. However, in the South Pacific, where islands are densely packed, each one becomes an air base for the other, and the circles of aerial power are intertwined like dogs' teeth. There is no one-sided air supremacy; it is a decisive battle under so-called "semi-air supremacy." Moreover, due to the inconvenience of land transportation, the replenishment and reinforcement of combat troops, with the exception of a few cases where supplies and food can be dropped from the air, cannot but rely on naval vessels, making it a special battlefield, "a decisive battle for replenishment under semi-air supremacy." This is the current situation of the South Pacific war. To win this war, the most urgent thing is to expand the air power of aircraft, and the next is ships for replenishment.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean</p>
<p>The enemy fleet has already gathered considerable strength in the Indian Ocean. According to the observation of Naval Colonel Moa-Agitz-Bebergde published in the Bosen Daily on December 17 last year, "there are 7-8 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 8 heavy cruisers, 8 light cruisers, and in addition, many destroyers and other auxiliary ships." Their numbers are sufficient for a sea battle. Moreover, recently, the British Air Force and the US Air Force have been unified on the Southeast Asian front, with Lee Chuck and Pias appointed as commanders, and surveillance of the northern Bay of Bengal has been strengthened, military supplies have been accumulated, and the number of ships entering and leaving various ports in the Indian Ocean has increased. The enemy's actions in this area are gradually becoming active. In this way, the war clouds in the Indian Ocean are like the silence before a storm, brewing major changes. The people in the rear should prepare for a steel-like posture and work hard in their respective positions to seek war and victory.

<h3>Household Rice Ration to be Increased to 2.5 Sheng from Late This Month: Chairman of the Food Adjustment Committee Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Ji Hua, Chairman of the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee, issued the following statement regarding the gradual increase in rice rations for citizens: The Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee is the highest management organization for the unified planning and distribution of rice for the Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai Special Municipality. Its members include the Shanghai Food Bureau, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Japanese Embassy, the Economic Section of the Japanese Consulate General, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee. The purpose of its work is to solve the fundamental food problem of the people's livelihood and to seek satisfactory supply. Recently, thanks to the cooperation and assistance of Chinese and Japanese military officers and civilians, great confidence has been gained in adjusting rations and ensuring sources of supply. Especially as a result of the efforts of the Rice Control Committee and its lower-level organizations, purchases and transportation have made significant progress, which is a great joy to celebrate. The effect is that the household rice ration for citizens has been gradually increased from 1 Sheng to 2 Sheng since mid-January, and will be further increased to the highest standard of 2.5 Sheng per week in late January, and it will be high-quality white rice. In this new year, the people's livelihood has achieved double the joy of stability. At the same time, not only can the flour ration maintain the standard of 1 catty per week, but there is also a tendency to increase it. The Food Bureau has also distributed the overdue flour from the past, and the problem of people's livelihood has begun to be solved. I am very happy to have this opportunity to report this good news to the citizens. At the same time, I hope that the citizens will deeply understand the various difficulties in rice and grain purchase and distribution and the government's crackdown on the black market. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to practice frugality to ensure the smooth supply of materials. In addition, the quantity of rations in the future can generally maintain the current level. I hope that the citizens will work together to assist the authorities in suppressing the black market to maintain people's livelihood. In addition, the authorities also have detailed plans for the fuel problem, which is closely related to food, and the distribution and elimination of the black market will not be a problem.</p>
<p>Special Ration of Coal Briquettes Increased by One Month's Worth</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the end of last year, the supply and demand relationship of coal catty in this city has been slightly imbalanced. The authorities immediately implemented restrictions on coal catty consumption, causing some citizens to panic suddenly and make various speculations. However, since this year, the import of coal catty from North China has been very smooth. In addition to the continued distribution in important industries, the future of coal for general household use is also very optimistic. The authorities, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the general need for fuel should be higher, have decided to implement a special ration of coal briquettes and other fuels in the near future. For coal briquettes, in addition to the normal ration, an additional month's worth will be specially distributed. The current coal briquette panic can be greatly reduced as a result.</p>
<h3>Registration Certificates for Publications in This City are Issued by the Propaganda Department: Absolutely No Publication is Allowed Before Approval</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The publication of newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or pamphlets in this city was formerly handled by the former Concession's Public Works Department, which issued licenses. Now that the Concession has been taken over, it should be handled in accordance with the publication law promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, the Standing Bureau has decided that from now on, it will be issued by the Propaganda Department of the National Government, and the First District Public Office and the First Police Bureau announced detailed measures yesterday. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Proclamation of the First District Public Office</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office Proclamation: Regarding the registration of newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or pamphlets, the former Public Works Department announced Article 4878 on October 21, 26th year of the Republic of China. It has now been decided that from now on, the first provision contained in the proclamation will no longer apply. This proclamation.</p>
<p>Proclamation of the First Police Bureau</p>
<p>"The Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government's Xuanzi No. 571 instruction states, 'The Publication Law and its implementing rules have been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. The former Public Works Department's proclamation and the newspaper, magazine, and publication registration rules promulgated in the 26th year of the Republic of China no longer apply. The First District Public Office has been ordered to immediately announce its abolition. All registration certificates issued by the former Public Works Department and the Bureau recently should be invalidated from January 15, 33rd year of the Republic of China. The Bureau should also notify all published publications that have not yet applied for registration with the Propaganda Department to complete the application procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Publication Law before January 15 of the same year. Those who fail to do so by the deadline should be ordered to cease publication. In the future, new publications are absolutely not allowed to be published before they are registered and approved by the Central Government, otherwise they will be punished according to law. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the Publication Law and the Travel Regulations is attached to order the Bureau to comply with and report as necessary, etc.' and a copy of the Publication Law is attached. Therefore, it should be complied with. However, the deadline of January 15 has passed. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government to approve an extension to January 31 in order to complete the procedures on schedule, all publishers of publications are notified to comply and register with the Bureau within the deadline. In the future, new publications must comply with the registration procedures before they can be published. Do not deliberately violate this, otherwise you will be punished."</p>
<p>Talk by Police Authorities</p>
<p>Regarding the procedures for registering publications, a Central News Agency reporter yesterday visited the police authorities and received the following statement: Today, Notices No. 59 from the First District Public Office and No. 12 from the First Police Bureau announced that the registration certificates for publication registration applications were issued by the First District Public Office (or the former Public Works Department). In the future, they will be issued by the Propaganda Department of the National Government. However, when handling this registration, it must still be submitted by the First Police Bureau for verification. Therefore, those who obtained registration certificates from the old Public Works Department and the First District Public Office but have not registered with the Propaganda Department of the National Government should quickly go to the Inspection Section of the Special High Office of the First Police Bureau at No. 181 Jiangxi Road, Construction Building (intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road) on the sixth floor, Room 610 to obtain the application form. After filling it out, prepare four photos of the applicant and submit them to the Section by the deadline. Also, the former Public Works Department registration certificate has been announced as invalid, so the old registration certificate should be submitted to the Inspection Section for cancellation as soon as possible. The above is the procedure for exchanging for a new registration certificate. Those who are newly applying for registration should also handle it in accordance with the National Government's Publication Law. First, submit the application to this Bureau."</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Reports on Canal Management Plan</h3>

<p>Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Commentary: What Should We Regard Chinese Stocks As?</h3>
<p>Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, Chinese stocks are still showing a thriving state in a buying frenzy, which cannot be said to be a good phenomenon in the wartime Shanghai economic circle, because the prosperity of securities trading is most conducive to the prosperity of the urban economy, which is beyond doubt. However, this so-called prosperity does not refer to all the abnormal excitement in the securities market, such as the hundred-fold pumping up by stock issuers, the large-scale passing the buck by stock operators, and the chaotic snatching of hats by stock buyers and sellers. It is simply using Chinese stocks as gambling tools, which is by no means a normal indicator of Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>What should we often regard Chinese stocks as? Our answer is: Chinese stocks should be regarded as a legitimate way to develop national enterprises and expand production funds. In wartime, a country's war expenses and production funds are raised through many methods, but in the expansion of production funds, investing in various domestic production securities is the most appropriate way for the public to take. Its active role is to strengthen the power of increased production in wartime. And its passive role is to digest the floating purchasing power of the private sector, which can also be said to be the safest savings. This year is the year of increased production, and we enthusiastically expect it to be the year of Chinese stocks at the same time, because the normal development of Chinese stocks is closely related to the prospects for increased production.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Prohibits Over-the-Counter Trading of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association has recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance that after the resumption of business by the Chinese Stock Exchange, all trading of Chinese stocks should be concentrated in the exchange and absolutely no private over-the-counter trading is allowed. According to the regulations, the silver and money industry may buy and sell securities on behalf of customers, but the trading of these securities must be handled by brokers of the exchange. It is reported that the two industry associations have notified their members to comply.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Encounter Selling Pressure at High Prices: New Pharmaceutical Stocks are the Most Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks wanted to rise but were ultimately hindered by the money market. In the morning, they were sold off by overnight floating accounts, and the step saw a small decline. At noon, they felt particularly weak. In the afternoon, they resumed activity, ultimately squeezing out a little more than the previous day. The amount of circulating shares of Wing On Textile Mill felt increasingly scarce. Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing heard of new plans, and the payment was quite diligent, each rising by 2.5 yuan. Tongyi Textile Mill jumped by 20 yuan, and the rest mostly squeezed out a little. Among the department store stocks, Guanghua rose alone by 1 yuan, and Wing On and other three companies each saw a small increase of 3-5 yuan. The new pharmaceutical industry reported flatness and fatigue again. Among the chemical stocks, Dahua Match was swarmed up by 30 yuan, and the cultural industry Zhonghua Book Company exceeded the 500 yuan mark, and saw a new high price, rising by 60 yuan. Real estate stocks were weak and lacked vitality. Public utility stocks were thinly traded and stable. Others, such as Jiu'an Industrial, rebounded to rise, and Xin'a Construction returned to within 30 yuan. The rest mostly squeezed out a little.

Yesterday, it was reported that he helped to raise 20,000 yuan in scholarship funds from Mr. Lan Ba Sun and 10,000 yuan from Mr. Xu Changchun. The enthusiasm of Mr. Lan and Mr. Xu for public welfare is admirable and deeply respected. A certain gentleman from Wanjiang, known for his open-mindedness and sense of justice, is particularly enthusiastic about education. He personally founded a workers' school. Recently, recognizing the good methods of the scholarship fund, he specially raised 20,000 yuan in national currency, and had it sent to this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao, 10,000 yuan each, through lawyer Gao Yunlv. The gentleman's family is not wealthy; all his good deeds come from savings. His noble character is admirable.</p>
<p>Funeral Gift Money Transferred to Scholarship Fund</p>

<p>Profit Sharing Contributed to Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the Jiufu Barge Transportation Company, which read: "Your newspaper's scholarship fund benefits the poor and needy and is greatly beneficial. Our company, mindful of the suffering of the children of barge transportation workers who are deprived of education, but only recently started business and with insufficient resources, cannot provide universal relief. The board of directors has resolved to allocate 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes from the profits to be sent to your newspaper as a token of our sincerity." The company's concern for the poor and needy is admirable.</p>
<p>Children Sympathize with Those Deprived of Education</p>
<p>Ge, Jiu, Qiang, Nai Ming, and Nai Fen, five children, donated 300 yuan in cash, converted from entertainment expenses given by their parents, to the scholarship fund, sympathizing with those deprived of education, which is commendable. We hope other children will follow suit.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Sports Association Sports Field Planned Opening and Development of Various Sports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Association was officially established last month and has now formally begun operations. The association inherits the Shanghai Race Club and the Shanghai Western Recreation Ground organizations and will develop various sports on the original site of the racecourse, which will make a significant contribution to the sports community of this city.

<p>Amateur Horse Racing</p>
<p>Horse racing is considered a normal entertainment by countries in the East and the West, and is also a good movement. Members of the Shanghai Race Club and the International Recreation Club who love horse racing are now invited to participate, and the original horse racing rules of the two associations will still be adopted. For new jockeys who aspire to learn and practice, the association plans to hire experts to set up training classes. However, all jockeys are amateur in nature, and are exactly the same as other sports personnel, and do not accept any compensation.

<h3>National Forum</h3>
<h3>Hoping for the Cancellation of Restrictions on the Use of Ambulances Zifang</h3>
<p>Policies or measures that alleviate the suffering of the public and seek welfare for society are called good governance. Good governance benefits the country and the people, and the people always enthusiastically support and assist in all facilities. The sickrooms and ambulances set up by the Fire Department of the First District Office, which are dedicated to serving sick families, have undergone years of careful research and continuous improvement. Not only are the facilities comprehensive and the service conscientious, but they can also meet the psychology of the sick family and adapt to the needs of the condition, and the attendants in the ambulance are all well-trained, treat the sick family gently and politely, and are amiable. The sickrooms and ambulances can be called the best in Shanghai. Anyone who has used the ambulance praises it.</p>
<p>Previously, no matter who it was, as long as it was a sick family or a pregnant woman, it was difficult to move, from home to the hospital or from the hospital back home, no matter what time, late at night, white days, a phone call would arrive quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to save resources, the use of ambulances has been subject to very strict restrictions. It must be summoned by a formally registered doctor and a certificate must be issued before it can be used, otherwise, it will be rejected. In this way, the general patient feels extremely inconvenient, because most of the use of ambulances must be seriously ill, unable to move, difficult to walk, eager to be sent to the hospital for treatment, no time to delay, or pregnant women with rumbling abdomens, frequent births, three-wheeled vehicles, rickshaws are narrow and unstable, and the wind blows everywhere. With a little carelessness, cold and evil will take advantage of the weakness and enter, and there is a danger of life! Moreover, when the condition is urgent and on the verge of danger, the whole family is panicked, hoping to be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately, and what time do they have to run around asking the doctor to issue a certificate, and then call the ambulance by phone, even when the ambulance arrives, the patient is probably already dead!</p>
<p>The setting up of sickrooms and ambulances was originally intended to benefit sick families, reduce suffering, and save people from danger, with the aim of serving society. If the restrictions are so strict that those in distress cannot use them, wouldn't this be contrary to the original intention of setting up ambulances? It is not only negligent in human life, but also not a way to enrich the citizens.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely hope that the fire department, for the sake of taking into account the suffering and convenience of sick families, and implementing its original intention of serving the public, will quickly lift the restrictions. We must know that saving patients from danger is as important and urgent as putting out a fire! No matter what the situation, there should be no restrictions. Patients should be sent to the hospital for treatment or recuperation as soon as they are called, and should not be deliberately delayed or made difficult. If you think the fare is too cheap, you may as well increase it appropriately, but the most important thing is not to hurt the vitality of the citizens. In this way, not only will virtue be extended to the sick and reduce deaths, but all patients will also be grateful! (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Navy Aspiration (8) Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</h3>
<p>The Jisekikan of the arsenal was also destroyed, and the belongings of the common people were burned. In the midst of the great chaos of the citizens, July 2nd had passed, and on the third day, the fierce force of the wind and rain gradually subsided, and at this time, the British fleet finally began to retreat. Their path was exactly between Mt. Tenpo and the small island at sea, where Shin and Ryufu used to play every day.</p>
<p>There is also a battery on the small island at sea. The soldiers guarding this island, because they did not fire a single shot in yesterday's battle, were itching to try their skills. The chief of the fort here, calling himself Aoyama Foolish, was an old-fashioned Tensan-style artillery expert. Because the British ship was coming from the other side of the island, he stroked the round cannonball with his hand, "Today, I will trouble you," he said to the cannonball.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was also a gratifying expectation. That is, between the small island at sea and the burning cape, three electrically laid mines manufactured by Nakahara Yosuke were buried. The path of the British fleet was pointing in that direction. If they could wait a little longer, it would have an effect. But the impatient battery on the small island at sea had already begun its artillery fire. The British ship suddenly turned and retreated to the Shinse area, fiercely beginning to fight back. One shot hit and seriously injured Inoue Naoiri on the battery. Naohatsu later changed his name to Ryoka, and also received the rank of marshal.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Anglo-Satsuma War, it makes us feel that this war was really the cradle of marshals and famous generals. Marshals Oyama, Kawamura, Nozu, Saigo, Togo, Ito, and Inoue emerged one after another. Among them, except for three who were from the army, the rest were from the Satsuma navy. Furthermore, Rerei Kagenori, Akatsuka Genroku, Ijuin Matsuji, etc., who actually contributed to the Japanese navy, all participated in this battle. General Yamamoto Gonbei, who was only twelve years old, did not directly participate in the war, but also indirectly participated in the war by carrying cannonballs in the rear. From this point of view, the Satsuma-British War not only greatly stimulated the Satsuma clan, but also stirred up a huge wave in the Japanese people's thinking about the navy.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside for the moment, after the British ship retreated to the sea off Ogonezume and completed emergency repairs, it sailed to Yokohama again. Thus, the war came to an end, but the number of dead and wounded on both sides was unexpectedly small. The British side had 13 dead and 50 wounded, while the Satsuma army had only one dead and no more than six wounded.</p>
<p>From this result, it seems that the Satsuma side had won, but the fact was definitely not like this. Not only were the various batteries and the Jisekikan factory greatly damaged, but three steam merchant ships that Mitsu could not produce were also burned.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a war with no clear victor. At least in the war of warships against batteries, the Satsuma side lost. Moreover, they could not help but feel a kind of psychological pressure.</p>
<p>That was the surprising first glimpse of the British warships and cannons. The power of the warship of more than 2,300 tons, with a speed of eleven knots, and the Armstrong guns that fired conical projectiles, made them feel inferior to the enemy's superiority.</p>

<h3>Eagerly Awaiting Enthusiastic People to Start a Night University</h3>
<p>I am a high school graduate. Due to the pressure of the environment and economic constraints, I had to leave school and go into society. However, this is such a sad thing for me! Although I struggled several times, I always hit a wall. I had no choice but to get a job in a foreign company through a relative, doing what I didn't want to do. However, the desire for knowledge has not disappeared, so I save money every month and still have a surplus, preparing to continue to enter university, but time has become a problem. I can't give up my work, so I'm often worried about this and unhappy. I believe that there must be many young people who are also suffering from this. I hope that all the benevolent educators will have pity on these young people, think about their future, and set up more night universities, with all the courses being no different from the daytime courses. If there is not enough time to allocate, you may as well have classes on Sundays as well. I hope it can be successful soon. (Zihua)</p>
<h3>Dianyi Society Charity Performance for Education</h3>
