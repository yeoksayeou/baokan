<h3>適應現階段戰局　日強化國內體制　大東亞決戰陣容穩如磐石</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日東條首相為適應現階段戰局，謀國內體制之特殊强化，特於十九日斷然將內閣局部改組。按此次改組為去年四月二十日內閣改組後之根本舉措，由於此次對現時下最緊要之財政運輪食糧三部門人事之更新，實可調為內閣之政治力，茲已進一步强化。同時對戰力之飛躍增強。亦可期其達成。故日本戰時財政遝輸交通及食糧之緊要對策，巳固若磐石，此對日本决戰政冶之强化運營，實堪期待之至。此次日本內閣改組中心之大藏大臣，所以簡拔石渡氏就任者，乃係該氏任國府經濟最高顧問時，對中日財政經濟之連繫上，及對中國財政經濟之建設上貢獻頗大，且於平沼內閣任藏相時曾發揮卓羣之手腕，該氏此次就任戰事藏相，必能發揮其腕力，完遂决戰財政。又農商相之所以起任由內田氏者，緣日政府鑒於時局下食糧對策之迅速實行，為最重要課題、該氏於前任東北地方協議會長時，對食糧問題曾發揮實際手腕，故此次乃任氏為新大臣。又五島新運輸通信相為運輸交通界之巨子，且於行政上亦具有卓羣之見識，同時前於查察木造船之際，亦曾發揮其實際經驗，辦理極為圓滿，故此次乃自內閣　問簡拔為運輸相。</p>
<h3>大藏運輸兩相　說明抱負　推進財政運輸對策</h3>
<p>東京廿日中央社電　日新藏相石渡，廿日下午五時半在大藏次官邸招待記者團”答記者團問話，說明其對决戰財政金融運營之抱負。茲誌其問答如次：問，决戰財政　融之運營方策如何。答，財政金融問題自中日事變以來以迄今日，並無憂慮之處，余深倍財政基礎極為堅固。問，實行五百十億元預算時，應注意之點何在。答，預算之　成，以戰時財政情形視之，極為良好，實施龐大預算及消化公債，自以增强貯蓄最為重要。問，完成三百六十億元貯蓄方策如何。答，余深信每個國民本其愛國心貯蓄。則必能完成。問，通貨膨脹對策重點如何。答，余認為公價若能順利消化，則通貨膨脹之危險極少，因此首應增强貯蓄，時時以增稅吸收餘剩購買力，過去政府所採一取之方策已收宏效。問，大東亞金融政策如何。答大東亞相對金融方面情形頗為諳熟，故大東亞相對大東亞各國各民族之金融抱負與經綸，余决力加支持。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日五島運輸相頃就决戰期間之增强運輸力方針，發表談話如次：關於運輸通信省之組織洪構業就緒，余雖有意見，但大體仍照現况而增强其力量而已。增强海上運輸力量，决以最大重點而推進之，初步為極力增加製造木造船，期在沿岸運輸方面可以盡量利用之，鋼造船則供南方方面運輸之需要。又關於修理木造船亦極重要，余欲使全國木造船所三分之一，作為修理專門工塲，關於港灣倉庫業之增强統制，已由八田前任還輸相積極辦理，故此後擬迅速實現。</p>
<h3>三大臣略歷</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日內閣十九日局部改組，石渡莊太郎，內田信也，五島慶太，三氏分別新任大藏。農商。運輸通信三省大臣。茲將三氏略歷介紹於次：新藏相</p>
<p>石渡莊太郎</p>
<p>曾於昭和十四年（民國廿八年）一月任平沼內閣時藏相，今次再任藏相，係屬二度出馬，又氏除於平沼內閣任藏相外，曾任米內內閣之書記官長。貴族院議員。大政翼贊會事務總長。東亞經濟懇談會長。嗣後於昭和十七年十一月起繼現任靑木大東亞相任國府最高經濟憲談　。以迄於今。氏係大正五年（民國五年）事業於東京帝大，為故樞密顧問官　渡敏一民之長子，東大畢業後，即任職於大藏省，迄平沼組閣而人閣，其後即活躍於政界財界中，氏性格神，莫不驚奇而感欽佩。氏與靑木大東亞相及賀屋前藏相均被稱為大藏省出身之三傑。新農商相</p>
<p>內田信也</p>
<p>氏生於於縣，明治三十八年（光緒三十一年）畢業於東京高商後，任事於三幷物產公司，第一次世界大戰發生後，氏即由該公司退職，從事船舶業，其後乃投身於政界，於大正十三年（民國十三年）當選後，即投身於政友會，在政界中着着佔有地位。昭和三年（民國十七年）田中內閣時，任海軍省政務次官，隸於岡田海相之下，昭和七年犬養內閣時任遞信政務次官，昭和九年罔田內閣時脫離政友會，就任鐵相。在昭和十一年發生之國鐵疑獄當時，氏因被疑為受賄而被起訴，幾經艱阻，如於十五年之第二審中判其無罪，彼經辭苦難後，乃益為任器重，當去年七月時局緊迫之際，日政府為加强地方行政，曾設立地方協議會，當時氏被推為宮城縣知事，對東北六縣之決戰行政多所貢獻。氏為任豁朗闊達，精明強毅，當此時局緊張之時，氏出任農商相，各方對氏之手腕力量期待愈股，</p>
<p>五島慶太</p>
<p>之就任日本第二屆運蝓通信大臣事，於舊臘氏任木造船查察使之當時，即為人所料及。自氏之經歷視之，就運輸通　大臣之職，實恰當其任。五島新大臣於財界供職之當時，對統治私營鐵道曾發揮敏腕，而將東京近縣之私鐵大半統治之，由氏此種實行力與決斷力。故此次乃得擔富决戰下運輸行政之重任。新大臣為日鐵道省出身，故想將可促進統制陸上運輸以及小運輸問題之解决，尤以最近曾以木造船查察便之資格，推進木造船之緊急增產，又民曾於實業界多年，通曉一切，故關於現仍未解决之倉庫統制港灣統制等海上運輸網事務，定將可解决之。</p>
<h3>表彰科學技術人員</h3>
<p>「日技術院鑑於各科學技術人員改革研究各種科學技術，對於增强國家戰力貢獻至鉅，為代表國家表示謝意及嘉獎鼓舞起見……爰於十一日紀元節上午十一時，假此間華族會館舉行表彰儀式。由技術院總裁授與獎章及獎金一萬元。……此次受表彰章者計二十七件，均為日本科學技術界最高成就。……（見本月十二日本報中央社十一日東京電）。於此可見：</p>
<p>科學技術人員對於增强國家戰力之重要。近代全面戰爭原為民族總力和之較量，絕對非前綫將士單獨所能負其責仟。至於民族總力之和，叉惟有用科學方式方能使之增進，蓋惟有科學技術能使時間經濟，並能利用天然之產物而製成念需之物資。故民族總力和之大小，不盡以民族人數之多寡為標準，而端視其科學技術程度之高低以為斷。</p>
<p>國家應提倡並鼓舞科學技術人員之工作。凡科學技術上之工作，大都皆艱鉅沈悶，非有相常之智力與毅力不克勝任而著效，故科學技術人員而有出類拔萃之成績者，固為民族中之最優秀之分子，宜加嘉獎，而其福國利民之殊勳，尤當盡量表彰，藉以鼓舞後進。</p>
<p>日本在戰爭時期中科學技術成就之偉大。戰爭手段周以疆塲上最為顯著，戰爭情緒同以前綫最為緊張，但後方所有一切，若不能與疆塲前綫相配合，决無以爭取最後之勝利。日本此次技術院所審查之提案，係由有關各機關及附屬團體所推荐，總數竟達七百餘件之多，就中受表彰者為七十一件。一方面可見日本對於名器之審愼，同時可推測此七十餘件旣為最高之成就，則科學技術界一般之貢獻必十百倍於此。德國於一九四二年一年之中，專利執照之登記為五萬餘件（見木報一月十四日社評），日德兩國後方對於科學技術之努力，足相輝映。</p>
<p>反觀吾國，自海通而與各國接觸，未嘗不感覺科學之重要，未嘗不知效法東西鄰邦截長補短，然迄今百年，成效如何？匪特重工業毫無基礎，因而國防需要仰給於人，即衣食住行之設備尙莫非舶來之品，可憫亦復可恥。自中日事變發生之後，尤其自參加大柬亞戰爭以來，有志之士固深知國內科學程度之幼稚，非急起直追無以圖存。而上下朝野一般之趨向，絕無埋頭苦幹之表現，對於投機囤積營私舞弊，則莫不竭盡其强取豪奪之能事。競競於科學，孜孜於技術者，不特視為寒酸冬烘，人所不齒，抑且衣食不周，徒喚奈何，更何論嘉獎與誘掖。願我國自今以往，鑒於日本表彰科學技術人員之舉，知所警惕，痛革前非。桑榆非晚，亟起圖之！</p>
<h3>周副院長　蒞徐州視察　主持中儲支行開幕禮</h3>
<p>徐州二十日中央社電　國府行政院副院長兼財政部部長中儲總裁周佛海氏，為主持巾央儲備銀行徐州支行開慕典禮，及視察淮海省政治經濟狀况，特於十九日最偕同　副總裁，木村顧問，及隨員等一行搭機蒞徐，淮海省郝省長，越智運絡部長，率領軍政要員，赴機塲歡迎。周副院長降機後，與郝省長及聯絡部長　禮寒暄後，即分承汽車赴官邸進午餐。下午三時派代表至盟邦日軍司令部，陸軍病院，總領事館，連絡部憲兵隊及日居留民團訪問。四時周副院長蒞省政府，郝省長迎至貴賓室，五時正，本市各金融機關領袖，由孫財政廳長率領晋謁致敬，周副院長即予接見並就進海省中儲券流通額擴充問題及經濟金融今後之發展頗多訓勉。五時半接見中儲支行經理馬淑英，徐州鹽務管理處長沈鼎新，所得稅局長葛之幹，聰取本省經濟狀况報吿。下午六時出席徐州公會堂靑少年團及中小學生歡迎演講大會，當晚出席郝省長歡宴。</p>
<h3>中儲支行　行開幕禮</h3>
<p>徐州二十日中央社電　中央儲備銀行徐州支行，自行籌備以來，於公明修建行址，現已工竣，內部佈置，均已完成，於今（二十日）晨十時，舉行盛大間幕典疆。周總裁，錢副總裁，本村顧問等，均於昨日蒞徐主持，被邀觀禮者，計有淮海省郝省長以下各廳處局長，徐州市長，及盟邦方面，有越智連絡部長，駐徐村上代總領專等，及本市中日金融界商界領袖，共約二百餘人。十時正典禮開始、首由</p>
<h3>周總裁致詞</h3>
<p>略謂：今天中儲銀行徐州支行開幕，承省府方面及友邦方面諸位光臨，殊覺榮幸，過去中儲券在淮海省流通，得徐州中日官民協力頗多，本人甚為感謝，儲備券自從發行以來，信用鞏固，流通日廣，已為華中華南的唯一的通貨，淮海地區，因使用聯銀券的關係，至去年十二月一日中儲券方開始流人，過去淮海地區的政治，經濟，即因此種關係，不能統一，以致中間有許多不便，此次中儲徐州支行成立，此種矛盾現象。即可消除。中儲券在淮海省的擴展流通，不僅在經濟方面有看重大的意義，一樣。自中國參戰以來，力謀充實國力，供給戰爭需要的重要物資，過去因政治經濟不一致，華中華北的物資交流乃不能圓滑，同時華中經濟政策也不能統一實施，而中儲券在淮海省普　流通後，深信今後華中華北物資交流，必能圓滑，對中國之建設及大東亞戰爭的貢獻，亦必增多，因此今日中儲徐州支行開幕，意義之重大可知。本人及錢副總裁，舉行各局處長，木村顧問等親來主持這個開幕典禮，為其他各地支行開慕所未曾有者，尤足徵徐州支行所負使命之重大，中儲徐州支行，現成為徐州方面的金融機關中心，對於增加生產，收買物資所需要的資金，盡量貸給，决不供給於投機囤積之用。根據以往的經騐，每當通貨變更時，便有不良商民乘機抬價，中央方面，對此已嚴加注意，希望省政府當局，對此嚴予防止。同時在戰爭期間。節約消費與獎勵儲蓄，至為重要，此亦希望中日長官深明此旨，多予協助云云。周總裁致詞畢，旋請來賓致詞。首由郝省長致詞，略謂」今日參加中央儲備銀行徐州支行開幕典禮，非常光榮，省政府方而，决以全力協助，使中儲券流通順利開展，繼有友邦方面村上代總領事致詞，劉於周總裁所言政治經濟統一一點，極表贊同，最後由中儲徐州支行馬經理致答詞畢，即進茶點招待來賓，盛大之與禮於焉完成。</p>
<h3>周財長　發表談話</h3>
<p>徐州二十日中央社電　周副院長於出席淮海省靑少年團及徐市中小學生歡迎演講大會後，即與郝省長返抵省府貴賓室，於六時半接見日記者，發表談話稱，本人去年春犬，曾到處視察，此次來徐，看到今日淮海省的情形，覺得比前進步，尤其在徐州中日雙方合作的情形，覺得非常融治。自蘇淮成立特區以來，政治方面雖直屬於中央，在經濟方面則屬北方，通貨為聯銀券，通常然是不自然的，故兩年以前，本人即打算將蘇淮政洽經濟使之一致，當國府參戰之際，曾與國府經濟顧問靑木氏談及此事，靑木氏並來徐視察。對於本人意見。表示贊成，嗣後靑木氏任大東亞省大臣後始克實現。三月一日以後聯銀停止發行，聯儲關係仍與前相同價格仍依照一百比十八不加改變，惟每次通貨變更，商民常乘機抬價，政府對此自由相當措置，同時希望各位更加勸導。中儲徐支行成立後，徐州金融中心當局為中儲支行，一切需要資金亦由中儲銀行供給，中儲供給之目標，用以增加生產，流通貨物之正當事業，投機囤積等，自不在供給之例。</p>
<h3>西南太平洋方面　日軍獲重大戰果　擊毀敵機九架船舶一艘</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　西南太平洋方面之日美空戰，連日極為熾烈。茲綜合拉巴爾新幾內亞及馬紹爾羣島之雅爾特等日軍各基地消息，日海軍機及陸上部隊所獲戰果如次：　敵小型聶炸機九架，十九日上午曾來襲馬紹爾羣島之雅爾特島，被日軍海軍守備隊擊落其二架，日方無損失。　敵機百六十四架，十八日上午來製拉巴爾，日海軍航空部隊戰鬥機隊昇空邀擊，與之展開熾烈空戰，結果擊落敵B25架，P40型機三架，P45型機二架共七架，日方損失飛機三架。　敵海上艦艇十八日晨米犯馬爾紹羣島馬羅厄拉布環礁塔羅娃島，加以砲擊，又敵波特西哥斯基FBF型艦載戰鬥機及統一式B24型轟炸機十一架，累數亦曾連續數次來襲，該島之日軍守備隊均將其擊退，日方損失輕微。　敵洛基奎P38型機統一式B24北美B25機等戰鬥轟炸機聯合隊約百架，十大日上午來襲新愛爾蘭島之加比恩，日軍守備隊當即將其擊退，日方損失輕微。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　南太平洋日軍前綫某基地訊：日海軍機隊十八日上午在新不列顚島馬加斯角洋面，兜捕敵小型船舶隊，加以猛烈轟炸，並擊破其駁船一艘。</p>
<h3>安定中國民生　強化糧食自給政策</h3>
<p>要在大東亞戰爭中獲得勝利，中日兩國人民必須理解亞洲民族解政戰的價義。所謂「同甘共苦」，不應祗是口頭禪。而須在兩國的政治經濟文化關係上現實地具體化。所以兩國人民深切注視中日關係的推移，去年一月的對華新政策，十月末的中日同盟條約，及大東亞宣言等，對於中國民衆的影響如何。日本民衆切盼政府有所說明。本屆議會中，山本大東亞次官在衆議院决算委員會席上，就日本政府的對華政策之影　。說明如次：</p>
<p>對民衆的影響</p>
<p>自從去年一月實施對軍新政策以來，日本方面一一實行交還租界，　發治外法　等的約束，結果，一般民衆，已漸漸了解日本方面道養的立塲。但在戰時下，一　　　　生　的安定上，受到相當的威脅與限制，日軍慶方面又宣傳說「日本的新政策口惠而實不至」，尤其關於生活問題，當初　般民衆誤解日本的真意，故並沒有惑到直接的影響。但日本不單在條約　約　，且一一付之　有，故其　意似乎　被了解。最近在一般民衆之問，信賴日本誠意的空氣，一天一天普通起來。去年十月末中日同　　德簽訂，根本規定了中日關係，而大東　宣言不僅向大東亞各國　且向全世界闡明了日本的真意，故在此以後，對於一般民衆的影響，頗為良好，火體說來，今日的情形，　順日本的意思很强，而趨向於對日協力的一途</p>
<p>對日僑的影響</p>
<p>日僑目前約為六十五萬左右。日本的對華政策，以前靠治外法權，租界或兵力為背景而推進。發展：因此，治外法權的撤廢及租界的交還，最初確有相當影響。日僑中對新政策不無出以批判的態度者。俱之後一般日僑似漸理解。日本的對華新政策。於是為了眞正的日華提携，並火東亞的興隆，應開誠佈公的互相提携，互相尊敬。這在大東亞的建設上，進而在戰勝大東亞戰爭上，根木是必要的。</p>
<p>食糧問題</p>
<p>從民生的安定，治安的維持，戰力的增强等開發資源的關係觀來，先須解决食糧問題。在過去，曾　外國輸入相當數　的食糧，但在生　（減退中的今日，食糧的供給如不圓滑，不能把握民心。現在的情形，食糧方面，正在實行種種增產計劃，以謀自給自足。例如在華北方面，實施農業水利的設備，普及優良品種　改善耕德方法，防除病虫害，養成技術員供給肥料種子開　運河大興土木事業等方法，努力增產食糧。國民政府最近亦從日本招聘那須博士等進行研究種種實際問題。</p>
<p>物價問題</p>
<p>戰下發生後，因物資　缺之輪人杜絕，及其他世界戰時經濟的影響，物價火為騰　，以去　　的情形與昭和十六　（民國三十年）未比　　來，華北約為三倍三倍或五倍，華中約為五倍八倍或十倍。物價的騰貴，對民生有種種影響，國民政府正傾其全力以抑止物價騰貴，而努力確立公正的物價。現在國府所努力者，大體為生產增强，徹底收買食糧，强化統制並便利遝輸等對策。去年並實行收買棉紗布以之為交換物資　供給各地方，以圓滑地方與都市的物資交流。此為解决物價問題的要洪。　此，日本方面亦傾全力共同協力。在這意義上，高物價　民心及一般知　階級　有相富大的影書，故應　萬以萬全的　置。（翔：節　　二月四日　　日　　）</p>

<h3>Adapting to the Current War Situation: Japan Strengthens its Domestic Structure; the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle Formation is as Solid as a Rock</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to the current war situation and to seek special strengthening of the domestic structure, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo resolutely reorganized part of the cabinet on the 19th. This reorganization is a fundamental measure taken after the cabinet reorganization on April 20th of last year. As this time personnel changes are made to the three most important departments of finance, transportation, and food, it can truly adjust the cabinet’s political power and has been further strengthened. At the same time, a leap in the enhancement of war power can also be expected to be achieved. Therefore, Japan's wartime financial, transportation, and food policies are as solid as a rock, and it is truly worth looking forward to the strengthening and operation of Japan's decisive battle politics. The reason why Mr. Ishiwata was appointed as the Minister of Finance, the center of this Japanese cabinet reshuffle, is because, as the highest economic advisor to the National Government, he made great contributions to the connection between Chinese and Japanese finance and economy, and to the construction of Chinese finance and economy. Moreover, he demonstrated outstanding skills as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet. His appointment as the Minister of Finance for war will surely enable him to exert his skills and complete decisive battle finance. The reason why Mr. Uchida was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce is because the Japanese government, in view of the rapid implementation of food countermeasures under the current situation, regarded it as the most important task. As the former chairman of the Northeast Local Council, he demonstrated practical skills in dealing with the food problem, so he was appointed as the new minister this time. In addition, the new Minister of Transportation and Communications, Mr. Goshima, is a giant in the transportation and communication industry and also has outstanding administrative insights. At the same time, he also demonstrated his practical experience in inspecting wooden ships and handled it extremely satisfactorily. Therefore, this time he was appointed as the Minister of Transportation from within the cabinet.</p>
<h3>The Ministers of Finance and Transportation Explain their Aspirations and Promote Financial and Transportation Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Japan's new Finance Minister Ishiwata received a group of reporters at the official residence of the Deputy Minister of Finance at 5:30 p.m. on the 20th. In response to questions from the reporters, he explained his aspirations for the operation of decisive battle finance and finance. The record of his Q&amp;A is as follows: Question: What are the strategies for the operation of decisive battle finance? Answer: There have been no worries about financial problems since the Sino-Japanese Incident until today. I deeply believe that the financial foundation is extremely solid. Question: What should be noted when implementing the 51 billion-yen budget? Answer: The formation of the budget is very good in terms of wartime financial conditions. The most important thing for implementing a huge budget and digesting public bonds is to increase savings. Question: How to complete the 36 billion-yen savings plan? Answer: I firmly believe that every citizen will be able to complete it with their patriotic savings. Question: What is the focus of the inflation countermeasures? Answer: I believe that if public prices can be digested smoothly, there is very little risk of inflation. Therefore, we should first increase savings and absorb the remaining purchasing power with increased taxes from time to time. The policies adopted by the government in the past have achieved great results. Question: What is the financial policy for Greater East Asia? Answer: I am quite familiar with the financial situation in Greater East Asia, so I am determined to support the financial aspirations and management of each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Japan's Minister of Transportation, Mr. Goshima, recently issued a statement on the policy of strengthening transportation capacity during the decisive battle period, as follows: The organizational structure of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has been prepared. Although I have opinions, it will generally maintain the status quo and strengthen its strength. Strengthening maritime transportation capacity will be promoted with the greatest emphasis. The initial step is to greatly increase the manufacture of wooden ships, so that they can be used as much as possible in coastal transportation, while steel ships will be used to meet the needs of transportation to the South. In addition, repairing wooden ships is also extremely important. I want to make one-third of the wooden shipyards in the country as specialized repair factories. The strengthening and control of port and warehouse industries has been actively handled by the former Minister of Transportation, Mr. Hatta, so it is planned to be realized quickly in the future.</p>
<h3>Brief Biographies of the Three Ministers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese cabinet was partially reorganized on the 19th. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, Mr. Shinya Uchida, and Mr. Keita Goshima were newly appointed as Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Commerce, and Transportation and Communications, respectively. The following is an introduction to the brief biographies of the three gentlemen: New Finance Minister</p>
<p>Shotaro Ishiwata</p>
<p>He served as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet in January of the 14th year of Showa (1939). This is his second time serving as the Minister of Finance. In addition to serving as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet, he also served as the Chief Secretary of the Yonai Cabinet, a member of the House of Peers, the Secretary-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the Chairman of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference. Afterwards, from November of the 17th year of Showa, he succeeded the current Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Aoki, as the highest economic advisor to the National Government until now. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in the 5th year of Taisho (1916) and is the eldest son of the late Privy Councilor Mr. Toshiichi Ishiwata. After graduating from the University of Tokyo, he immediately took a position in the Ministry of Finance. He entered the cabinet when the Hiranuma Cabinet was formed, and has been active in the political and financial circles ever since. His personality is amazing and admirable. He, Mr. Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, and Mr. Kaya, the former Minister of Finance, are known as the three heroes from the Ministry of Finance. New Minister of Agriculture and Commerce</p>
<p>Shinya Uchida</p>
<p>He was born in Aichi Prefecture and graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in the 38th year of Meiji (1905). He worked at Mitsubishi Corporation. After the outbreak of World War I, he resigned from the company and engaged in the shipping industry. Later, he entered the political world. After being elected in the 13th year of Taisho (1924), he joined the Seiyukai and gradually gained a position in the political world. In the 3rd year of Showa (1928), he served as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of the Navy in the Tanaka Cabinet, under the Minister of the Navy, Mr. Okada. In the 7th year of Showa, he served as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Communications in the Inukai Cabinet. In the 9th year of Showa, he left the Seiyukai and took office as the Minister of Railways. During the National Railway Scandal that occurred in the 11th year of Showa, he was suspected of taking bribes and was prosecuted. After several difficulties, he was acquitted in the second trial in the 15th year. After experiencing hardships, he was even more valued. When the situation became critical in July of last year, the Japanese government established local councils to strengthen local administration. At that time, he was appointed as the governor of Miyagi Prefecture and made many contributions to the decisive battle administration in the six prefectures of Tohoku. He is known for his open-mindedness, shrewdness, and determination. At this time of tension, his appointment as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce has raised expectations for his skills and strength.</p>
<p>Keita Goshima</p>
<p>His appointment as the second Minister of Transportation and Communications in Japan was expected when he served as the inspector of wooden ships last year. Judging from his experience, taking the position of Minister of Transportation and Communications is truly appropriate for his position. When the new Minister Goshima was working in the financial world, he demonstrated his talent in controlling private railways and controlled most of the private railways in the vicinity of Tokyo. Because of his execution and decisiveness, he was able to shoulder the important task of transportation administration under the decisive battle. The new minister came from the Japanese Railway Ministry, so it is expected that he will promote the consolidation of land transportation and the solution of small transportation problems. In particular, he has recently promoted the emergency production of wooden ships with the qualifications of inspecting wooden ships. Moreover, he has been in the business world for many years and understands everything, so he will definitely be able to resolve the maritime transportation network affairs such as warehouse control and port control that have not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Commending Scientific and Technological Personnel</h3>
<p>"The Japanese Institute of Technology, in view of the fact that various scientific and technological personnel have reformed and researched various scientific and technological fields, and have made great contributions to enhancing the country's war power, in order to express the country's gratitude and commendation and encourage them... held a commendation ceremony at the Peer's Club here at 11:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month. The President of the Institute of Technology awarded medals and a cash prize of 10,000 yuan. ...This time, a total of 27 items were awarded medals, all of which are the highest achievements in the Japanese scientific and technological community. ... (See the Central News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 11th of this month in this newspaper on the 12th of this month)." From this, it can be seen:</p>
<p>The importance of scientific and technological personnel in enhancing national war power. Modern total war is originally a contest of national strength, and it is absolutely impossible for frontline soldiers to bear the responsibility alone. As for the sum of national strength, it can only be increased by scientific means, because only science and technology can save time and economy, and can use natural products to make necessary materials. Therefore, the size of national strength is not entirely based on the number of people in the nation, but on the level of its scientific and technological development.</p>
<p>The state should promote and encourage the work of scientific and technological personnel. The work of science and technology is mostly difficult and boring. It cannot be competent and effective without considerable intelligence and perseverance. Therefore, scientific and technological personnel who have outstanding achievements are indeed the most outstanding members of the nation and should be commended. Their special contributions to benefiting the country and the people should be fully recognized to encourage future generations.</p>
<p>The greatness of Japan's scientific and technological achievements during the war. War methods are most obvious on the battlefield, and war emotions are most tense on the frontline. However, if everything in the rear cannot cooperate with the battlefield frontline, there is no way to win the final victory. The proposals reviewed by the Japanese Institute of Technology this time were recommended by relevant agencies and affiliated organizations, totaling more than 700 items. Among them, 71 items were commended. On the one hand, it can be seen that Japan is prudent in its reputation, and at the same time, it can be inferred that since these 70 items are the highest achievements, the general contribution of the scientific and technological community must be ten or a hundred times greater than this. In 1942, Germany registered more than 50,000 patents (see the editorial in this newspaper on January 14). The efforts of the rear in Japan and Germany in science and technology are mutually illuminating.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, since opening up to the sea and contacting various countries, we have always felt the importance of science, and we have always known how to learn from our eastern and western neighbors to make up for our shortcomings. However, what has been the effect after a hundred years? Not only is there no foundation for heavy industry, so national defense needs to be supplied by others, but also the equipment for clothing, food, housing, and transportation is nothing but imported goods, which is both pitiful and shameful. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, especially since participating in the Greater East Asia War, people with lofty ideals have deeply realized that the level of domestic science is childish, and that there is no way to survive without catching up quickly. However, the general trend of the upper and lower classes of the government and the public has no expression of burying their heads in hard work. As for speculation, hoarding, seeking personal gain, and engaging in corruption, they all do their best to exploit and plunder. Those who compete in science and diligently pursue technology are not only regarded as poor and ignorant, and are despised by others, but also lack clothing and food, and only cry out in vain. How can we talk about commendation and encouragement? I hope that from now on, our country will learn from Japan's example of commending scientific and technological personnel, be aware of the warning, and thoroughly reform the past. It is not too late to make amends. Let's get up and make plans!</p>
<h3>Vice President Zhou Visits Xuzhou to Inspect and Preside over the Opening Ceremony of the Central Reserve Bank Branch</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Minister of Finance, and President of the Central Reserve Bank, came to Xuzhou by plane on the 19th with Deputy President, Consultant Kimura, and a group of entourages to preside over the opening ceremony of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and to inspect the political and economic situation of Huaihai Province. Hao, the Governor of Huaihai Province, and Yuezhi, the Minister of Liaison, led military and political officials to the airport to welcome them. After Vice President Zhou got off the plane, he exchanged polite greetings with Governor Hao and Minister of Liaison, and then took cars to the official residence for lunch. At 3:00 p.m., representatives were sent to the Allied Japanese Army Headquarters, the Army Hospital, the Consulate General, the Liaison Department Military Police, and the Japanese Residents Group for visits. At 4:00 p.m., Vice President Zhou visited the Provincial Government, and Governor Hao greeted him to the VIP room. At 5:00 p.m., the leaders of various financial institutions in the city, led by Director Sun of the Finance Department, paid their respects. Vice President Zhou immediately received them and gave many instructions on the issue of expanding the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province and the future development of economy and finance. At 5:30 p.m., he received Ma Shuying, the manager of the Central Reserve Bank branch, Shen Dingxin, the director of the Xuzhou Salt Administration Office, and Ge Zhigan, the director of the Income Tax Bureau, to listen to reports on the economic situation of the province. At 6:00 p.m., he attended the welcome speech meeting of the youth groups and primary and secondary school students in the Xuzhou Public Hall. That night, he attended a banquet hosted by Governor Hao.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Branch Holds Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch began preparations, it has been publicly constructing the site, which has now been completed. The interior layout has also been completed. This morning (20th) at 10:00 a.m., a grand opening ceremony was held. President Zhou, Deputy President Qian, Consultant Honmura, etc., all came to Xuzhou yesterday to preside over the ceremony. Those who were invited to observe the ceremony included Governor Hao of Huaihai Province and the heads of various departments and bureaus, the Mayor of Xuzhou, and the Allied side, including Minister of Liaison Yuezhi, Acting Consul General Murakami stationed in Xuzhou, and leaders of the Chinese and Japanese financial and business circles in the city, totaling about 200 people. The ceremony began at 10:00 a.m., starting with</p>
<h3>President Zhou's Speech</h3>
<p>Briefly stated: Today is the opening of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. I feel very honored that so many people from the Provincial Government and the Allied side have come. In the past, the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province has been greatly assisted by the cooperation of Chinese and Japanese officials and people in Xuzhou. I am very grateful. Since the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes, their credit has been solid and their circulation has been increasingly widespread. They have become the only currency in Central and Southern China. The Huaihai area used the Joint Reserve Bank notes, so the Central Reserve Bank notes only began to flow in on December 1 last year. In the past, the politics and economy of the Huaihai area were unable to be unified due to this relationship, resulting in many inconveniences. The establishment of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch this time will eliminate this contradictory phenomenon. The expansion and circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province is not only of great significance in the economic aspect. Since China's participation in the war, it has been striving to enrich its national strength and supply the important materials needed for the war. In the past, because of the inconsistency of politics and economy, the exchange of materials between North and Central China was not smooth, and the economic policies of Central China could not be implemented uniformly. After the widespread circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province, it is believed that the exchange of materials between North and Central China will definitely be smooth in the future, and the contribution to China's construction and the Greater East Asia War will definitely increase. Therefore, the significance of the opening of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch today is significant. President Qian and I, along with the heads of various departments and bureaus and Consultant Kimura, etc., came to preside over this opening ceremony in person, which has never happened in the opening of other branches, which is enough to show the importance of the mission undertaken by the Xuzhou Branch. The Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch has now become the financial center in the Xuzhou area. It will provide as much funds as possible for increasing production and purchasing materials, and will never provide funds for speculative hoarding. Based on past experience, whenever the currency changes, unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to raise prices. The central government has paid close attention to this and hopes that the provincial government will strictly prevent it. At the same time, during the war, it is extremely important to conserve consumption and encourage savings. We also hope that the Chinese and Japanese officials will understand this and provide more assistance. After President Zhou's speech, the guests were invited to speak. Governor Hao was the first to speak, briefly stating: "It is a great honor to participate in the opening ceremony of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank today. The provincial government will definitely assist with all its strength to ensure the smooth development of the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes." Then, Acting Consul General Murakami of the Allied side gave a speech, expressing his strong agreement with President Zhou's point on political and economic unification. Finally, Manager Ma of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch gave a reply. Immediately afterwards, tea and refreshments were served to the guests. The grand ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Zhou Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Vice President Zhou attended the welcome speech meeting of the youth groups and primary and secondary school students in Huaihai Province and Xuzhou City, he returned to the Provincial Government VIP room with Governor Hao. At 6:30 p.m., he met with Japanese reporters and stated in his speech that he had inspected everywhere last spring. This time when he came to Xuzhou, he felt that the situation in Huaihai Province today was more progressive than before, especially the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese sides in Xuzhou. It felt very harmonious. Since the establishment of the Su-Huai Special Zone, although the political aspect has been directly under the central government, the economic aspect has belonged to the north, and the currency has been the Joint Reserve Bank notes, which is usually unnatural. Therefore, two years ago, I planned to make the political economy of Su-Huai consistent. When the National Government participated in the war, I discussed this matter with the National Government Economic Advisor Aoki. Mr. Aoki also came to Xuzhou for inspection and expressed his agreement with my opinion. Afterwards, Mr. Aoki was able to realize it after he became the Minister of Greater East Asia. After March 1, the Joint Reserve Bank stopped issuing notes. The relationship with the Joint Reserve Bank remained the same as before, and the price remained unchanged at 100 to 18. However, every time the currency changes, merchants often take the opportunity to raise prices. The government has taken considerable measures on this, and at the same time hopes that everyone will further persuade. After the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch, the Xuzhou financial center authority will be the Central Reserve Bank branch. All the funds needed will also be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank. The goal of the Central Reserve Bank's supply is to increase production and circulate legitimate businesses of goods, and speculation and hoarding, etc., are naturally not included in the supply.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing the Livelihood of the Chinese People and Strengthening the Policy of Food Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>In order to win the Greater East Asia War, the people of China and Japan must understand the value of the war of liberation of the Asian people. The so-called "sharing joys and sorrows" should not just be a cliché. It must be realistically embodied in the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries. Therefore, the people of both countries are deeply concerned about the changes in Sino-Japanese relations. What is the impact of the new policy toward China in January last year, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty at the end of October, and the Greater East Asia Declaration, etc., on the Chinese people? The Japanese people are eager for the government to explain. In this session of the Diet, Vice-Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia, at the meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, talked about the impact of the Japanese government's policy toward China. The explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>Impact on the people</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new policy toward the military in January last year, the Japanese side has been implementing the return of concessions one by one and abolishing the constraints of extraterritorial rights. As a result, the general public has gradually understood the position of the Japanese side's guidance. However, in wartime, the stability of living is threatened and restricted to a considerable extent. The Japanese military has also been promoting the idea that "Japan's new policy is all talk and no action." Especially with regard to the issue of livelihood, the general public initially misunderstood Japan's true intentions, so they did not feel a direct impact. However, Japan is not only in the treaty, but also implements it one by one, so its intentions seem to be understood. Recently, the atmosphere of trusting Japan's sincerity has become more and more common among the general public. At the end of October last year, the Sino-Japanese alliance was signed, fundamentally regulating the relationship between China and Japan. The Greater East Asia Declaration not only clarified Japan's true intentions to the countries of Greater East Asia, but also to the world. Therefore, after this, the impact on the general public has been quite good. Generally speaking, the current situation is that the strength to comply with Japan's intentions is very strong, and there is a tendency to cooperate with Japan.</p>
<p>Impact on Japanese residents</p>
<p>There are currently about 650,000 Japanese residents. Japan's policy toward China has been promoted and developed in the past with extraterritoriality, concessions, or military force as the background. Therefore, the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions initially had a considerable impact. Among the Japanese residents, there were those who criticized the new policy. However, the general Japanese residents seem to gradually understand Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, for the sake of true Sino-Japanese cooperation and the rise of East Asia, we should cooperate and respect each other with openness and honesty. This is fundamentally necessary for the construction of Greater East Asia and the victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Food problem</p>
<p>From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood, maintaining law and order, enhancing war power, and developing resources, the food problem must be solved first. In the past, considerable amounts of food were imported from foreign countries, but today, with production declining, people's hearts cannot be grasped if the supply of food is not smooth. In the current situation, various production increase plans are being implemented in the food sector to achieve self-sufficiency. For example, in North China, we are implementing agricultural water conservancy facilities, popularizing improved varieties, improving farming methods, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, training technicians, supplying fertilizers and seeds, opening canals, and carrying out large-scale earthwork projects to strive to increase food production. The National Government has recently hired Dr. Nasu from Japan to conduct research on various practical issues.</p>
<p>Price problem</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, due to the lack of materials, the cessation of imports, and the impact of other world wartime economies, prices rose sharply. Compared with the end of 1941, North China was about three times three times or five times higher, and Central China was about five times eight times or ten times higher. The rise in prices has various impacts on people's livelihood. The National Government is devoting its full efforts to curbing the rise in prices and striving to establish fair prices. Currently, the National Government is generally working on measures such as increasing production, thoroughly purchasing food, strengthening control, and facilitating transportation. Last year, it also implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as exchange materials and supplied them to various places to smooth the exchange of materials between local areas and cities. This is the key to solving the price problem. To this end, Japan is also devoting its full efforts to cooperate together. In this sense, high prices have a considerable impact on the people and the general knowledgeable classes, so we should take all possible measures.

<h3>Turkish Military Expenditure Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Turkish government has submitted its budget proposal for the new fiscal year to the parliament, which will be debated when the parliament reconvenes on March 6th after the recess. The new budget totals 1,100,000,000 Turkish pounds, breaking all previous records. More than half of this is for national defense expenditure, and this item alone has increased by 30 percent compared to last year's budget. This shows the Turkish government's determination to maintain armed neutrality.</p>

<h3>Donghua Continues to Win, Defeating the Portuguese Merchants Again Yesterday; 3-0; Han Longhai Active</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Shanghai League A football match, Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants again at Yiyuan yesterday morning. The stands were full of spectators. Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants 3-0 again. No goals were scored in the first half. Ah Dai was injured and only watched from the sidelines. Han Longhai took over as center forward, and Wang Xisheng played as right winger. After 20 minutes, Li Ning was injured and left the field. Zhang Linggen was moved inside, Wang filled Zhang's vacancy, and Chen Mingzhe was moved in to play as right winger. Under such a changed lineup, Donghua was still able to exert its power, which was not easy. Han Longhai's bravery was especially praised by the audience throughout the field. Nineteen minutes after the start of the game, Youliang penetrated the penalty area, and Han Longhai descended from the sky, kicking hard and hitting the center of the goal, scoring the first goal. Not long after, Li Ning was injured and Chen Mingzhe was brought in. Donghua's offense remained undiminished. Thirty minutes into the game, Longhai dribbled past three defenders, straight to the Portuguese goal, and gently passed to Chen Mingzhe, who calmly shot into the net in front of the goal.

<h3>Last Week's Industrial, Commercial, and Financial Market Situation: The Trend of Hoarding Still Prevails</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai last week was still hovering in stability. The private trading of Chichi public bonds has gradually disappeared after the strict crackdown by the municipal authorities. With the tightening of money supply, speculative funds are not easy to flow. The stock market was stable, and the downward trend was rare. However, merchants with ample funds, because speculative activities in the financial sector are subject to crackdown by the authorities, have turned to the attempt to acquire goods. Most of them are engaged in purchasing and hoarding daily necessities, so the price increase of goods is becoming more and more intense. Wealthy citizens, especially speculators in the financial and industrial circles, are all hoarding goods. The authorities attach great importance to this behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation. Therefore, the price increase trend continued unabated last week, until Friday and Saturday when the price increase slowed down slightly.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Exchanges Stipulate Loan Principles</h3>
<p>In order to carefully handle lending business, the banks and money exchanges in this city have recently decided on the following principles:  Lending to customers with outstanding debts from last year will be stopped, and old debts will be strictly urged.  Overdraft facilities will not be granted to customers.  Acceptance of new mortgage loans will be temporarily suspended.
