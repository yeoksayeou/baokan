<p>社評</p>
<h3>學校工廠合一</h3>
<p>本年一月三十一日日本衆院決算委員會開會，討論學校動向，決定工業學校的設施，努力活用旣有的設備，或利用其附近工業學校所有的設備。本月十六日日本呆都帝大工業部，決定移至工廠授課，下月中旬，該校電氣工程科學生四十餘名，即先於加藤信義敎授指導下住宿於三菱電機公司某工廠，日間作兵器之寳地寳習，夜問則由各敎授分別講授課程。（見十七日本報）這種把學校工廠打成一片的學生生活，把敎，學，做，三件事合成一件的精神，日本當局「有議必決，有決必行，有行必速」的新氣象，眞是値得我們欽佩。</p>
<p>戰時需要增產，增產的意義是人力的增產和物力的增產。人力的增產比物力的增產重要，而技術人員的增產更比其他人才為重要。只有人力，方才能够充分利用已有的物力，補充不足的物力，創造新生的物力；而這些能夠想出法子，能夠指導工作的人，便是技術人員。技術人員在後方的責任，不亞於前綫的將士，假如後方的生產不能與前綫消耗的數量相符合，戰爭一定是衰而竭的。技術人員的重要如此，那末，充分利用已有的技術人員，和努力造就未來的技術人員，便是政府當局所應常注意的一件事，特別在戰爭時期，一步都鬆暇不得，一刻都浪費不得。</p>
<p>盟邦日本已經把這個問題解決了，解決的方法就是工廠學校合一。現在巳有的技術人員，無論是工廠技師，學校敎授，都負着二種責任，一方面努力使國家生產增進，一方面努力造就下一代的人才。同時，學生也負着二種責任，一方面努力求學使將來成功一個技術人才，一方而努力做工使現在國家增多生產。無論在那一方面的努力，敎也好，學也好，做也好，一切的一切，把戰爭做中心，這是戰時體制，這是戰鬥精神。</p>
<p>我們中國的工業原來落後，工廠的數量也不多，技術人員更缺乏，因此，僅就這些少數的人力物力，充分利用以謀將來發展的計劃，更是需要，更是急切。我們從前提出過「在業訓練」的辦法，又提出過利甩巳交還政府管理的敵產工廠，造就人才的意見。我們現在更希望全國的企業家，按照日本的方法，自動的請求大學校敎授和學生們的合作，依照其木身事業的性質，規定計劃，協助某二科某一部份技術人才的推進，這是對國家，對自己，對現在，對將來，都是有利的工作。同時政府方面應常竭力幫助企業的進行，予企業上的便利，獎勵這樣造就出來的人之。</p>
<h3>大本營正式宣布日軍已進入印境　並以怒濤之勢向德里猛攻</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電日，大本營昨晚九時發表：　現於中部印緬國境附近作戰中之我軍，在頓扎恩附近地區繼續對英印軍第十七師團展開殲滅戰，並支援印度國民軍之進擊，在三月中旬突破印緬國境，刻已進人印度國內。　敵自三月五日以來，曾以空輸部隊侵入北部緬甸之一部地區，我軍即於各處追剿，已將其一部殲滅。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　於中部緬印國境附近作戰中之日軍，其後更强調頓扎恩·梯迭姆周邊之英印軍第十七師之殲滅戰，一方復支援印度國民軍之活動，三月中旬以來，屢次突破印度國境綫，刻正以怒濤之勢，續向德里勇猛進攻中。日印軍三月八日於更的宛河谷，琴丘陵一帶中部國境地帶展開先制攻擊，於頓扎恩，梯迭姆及其北部之尼克特山岳地帶包圍以英印第十七師為主力之優勢敵軍，演成殲滅戰。三月十五日前後，將敵置於死境後，復迫之退至國境錢，在琴丘陸東北敏達密附近之日軍有力部隊及印度國民軍精銳部隊，一齊呼應進擊，摧毀布陣於該地之英印第二十三師，而自敵達密南北錢突破印度國境，十七日已深入印度領內，擎破巴特開山脈西斜面之敵據點空康及欠波爾，緬甸國境現在之情勢，已由從來之緬甸防衛作戰轉變為印度進攻作戰，精强無比之日印兩軍，指向敵軍東印度防衛戰力之核心猛烈進擊。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　印緬國境某地電，日印軍各部隊，刻仍在加鮑山岳地帶繼續進攻，威脅敵第二十·廿三兩師及第十七師之一部，並猛襲敵根據某地南方要衝威特庫，敵軍以戰車飛機實行反擊，日軍則對之加以反覆攻擊，卒於十九日攻克該地，即行北上，猛追敗敵。同時日印軍挺身隊為遮斷某地敵軍之退路，乃向印領前進，即於十九日夜炸毀某橋樑，將敵第二十·二十三兩師之退路完全遮斷，加鮑方面之敵一師，亦因而喪失退路，日軍則自南方猛擊，該方面敵軍刻已陷於被殲滅之危機。</p>
<h3>日軍當局發表　縮小包圍網　加薩附近英傘兵殲滅</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地電，日陸軍當局二十三日發表談話，謂日軍已展開大規模之作戰，茲錄要旨如次：緬甸方面我軍，以敵渝英美軍狂呼奪回緬甸，虎視耽耽，並在印緬國境附近地區開始蠢動，故自去秋以來，即充實戰力，於各方面實行先發制人之攻擊，首在怒江方面殲滅渝第三十六師，將其反攻企圖粉碎。又渝英美軍自去年十月末以來，即企圖進至當貢方面，我軍則以巧妙之作戰重創敵軍，本年二月並於阿拉坎方面，對敵第十五軍團之主力予以極大損害，繼於三月追剿琴丘陵方面之敵第四軍團主力，如此即將敵之反攻企圖完全粉碎，而能確保緬甸之安定，於使戰火不更擴大之範圍內，達到初期防衛之目的。然敵軍不僅仍在各地增派兵力，繼續執拗反攻，更自三月五日以來，在加薩降近緬甸北部一部地區，使降落傘部隊落下，威脅我軍背後，再使已恢復和平之該地區陷於戰亂之中，並出以種種暴行，欺凌無辜之良民。緬甸方面日本派這軍鑑於上述情勢，乃决意澈底覆滅印度東部之敵反攻策源地，印度國民軍於我軍展開阿拉坎中部琴丘陵殲滅戰後，已越過印緬國境，故我軍乃支援此等進擊之國民軍。同時，更澈底支援自由印度臨時政府之獨立解故戰。我軍進攻作戰之目的，乃為覆滅東印度企圖反攻之敵，打倒英美渝軍，並非以印度及印度民衆為敵，日本毫無領土之野心，我軍進駐之一寸一尺之土地，亦均準備歸自由印度所有。目下頓札恩方面已將敵殲滅，艾繼續以快速步關進擊遛姆附近加鮑溪各地區之敵先鋒，已突破緬印國境。又自哈加方面向孟加拉灣要衝之進擊，亦按所期之步驟進展中，因之於加薩附近降下之敵部隊，迄今日止已被殲數百名，我軍之句圍網正刻刻縮小中。總之，我軍之進擊印度，並未受任何妨害，又於西南沿岸兵力更趨充當，已完成堅强之戰陳。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地電，緬甸方面日陸軍轟炸隊，十六日晨踴躍自某基地出發，往襲緬印中部邊境敵重要據點及仁巴爾北方之敵機塲，以巨彈猛炸該機塲之滑走路及飛機塲設施，其三處中彈起火，一處發生大火災。另一部隊幷曾猛炸於仁巴爾至巴列爾間公路上疾走中之敵汽車羣，使敵心膽俱寒。又日機若干架大編隊，十七日晨復大舉襲仁巴爾。巴列爾及乙密猶機塲，使地上之陶格拉斯B-C3型機三架，小型機一架起火，同時幷與邀　之敵P40型及噴火式機十數架展開激烈空戰，當擊落其噴火式機五架，予該地區敵盎軍以殲滅之大損害。日機自炸及未返者各一架，並有一架受創。</p>
<h3>波根維爾日軍　繼續猛攻中　拉巴爾空襲敵機受挫</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大木營二十四日下午三時三十分發表：波根維爾島我軍部隊，已於三月上旬開始攻擊　守特羅基納附近堅固之半永久陣地敵軍約一師團之衆，輕激戰後，即奪取敵軍陣地一部，刻正　敵軍猛烈之砲擎，繼續攻擊中。</p>
<p>拉巴爾二十四日巾央社電　敵艦上轟炸機及戰鬥機，二十二日表曾大舉來襲拉巴爾，日軍守備部隊當即興之交戰，擊落其艦上轟炸機四架，日方陸上損害輕微。</p>
<h3>印度獨立解放　基礎已奠定　臨時政府特發表聲明</h3>
<p>昭南二十四日中央社電　東條首相闡明日本不惜全面支援印度獨立之决意後，自由印度臨時政府發言人二十三日特發表聲明如次：東條首相之談話，於現情勢下，其意義殊為深長，當自由印度國民軍與日軍緊密協力，開始向祖國印度進擊時，東條首相即曾明白稱述謂，日本對印度毫無領土以及政治之野心，日木軍於擊潰敵人之勢力後，决將印度完全委諸印度人之手，此語不僅已粉碎英國於印度國內之反日宜傳，且印度國內民衆已深悉國民軍所得之祖國印度領土，當即置於自由臨時政府行政下之約定，故反英抗爭益趨積極，確信國內之印度軍均將自動取協力之態度。吾等熟知英·美於解放義國之名義卜侵入該國後，當即由自國軍隊頒布軍政，致義民衆怨聲載道，而日本則堅持以愛報愛，以友情對友情之道義態度，故實與英·美迥異。日本質崇高精神，想不久即將由印度民衆充分報答，東條首相及鮑斯主席之聲明，更可使印度國內民衆反英意識之激化。兩國民衆之結合，將愈益鞏固，確信獨立解放之基礎已穩若磐石，不日即可實現。</p>
<p>昭南二十四日電僑居昭南二萬五千印度人，聞悉印國民軍已進入馬尼布爾候國轄境後，無不極表興奮，二十三日晚並舉行民衆大會，集合印民　約六千人，靜聽不管部部長阿拉葛朋之報吿演說·繼之納加中佐並代表羣衆向日東條自相致感謝之辭·最後齊呼飽斯主席之獨立宜言後，即吿閉幕·</p>

<h3>菲律賓獨立半載　協力信念益堅强　村田大使對日記者團談話</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十四日中央社電　日駐菲村田大使昨日接見日記者團，就菲律賓政府誕生半週年以來，積極協力日本之近况發表談話稱，菲律賓獨立以來瞬歷半載，菲共和國政府之要人與日本共同運命之信念益堅·依照日菲同盟條約精神，增强菲島之戰力物資及防衛態勢積極協力，洵堪嚴賀。洛勒爾總統所謂「日本無勝利，菲律賓則不能完全獨立，」此種信念不僅菲政府內部均有明白認識，即一般菲人亦均拘定此種槪念，故菲人之協力日本現益增鞏固。菲人前倚賴美國之經濟力，度其問易生活，茲當戰時下似已感受極種經濟苦痛，但菲人　此養成自主精神，忍受苦痛而積極解决此問題，如現在菲律賓之食糧問題，菲人亦已放棄旁觀態度，進而協力政府所取之政策，自動開墾空地，最近已全部化爲有用之地。由是以觀，菲律賓之食糧間題當不致如何困難，菲律賓之食糧問題結果爲都市之問題，如民衆能積極增產及暢通運輸，則以菲律賓土地之豐沃而觀，自可容易解决。最近旅菲日僑已組織日本人會，策應日本內地之非常措置，開始勞動服務國家。總之菲律寶政府之前途尚有許多困難，此後需要改善之慮頗多，惟菲政府成立僅半載，欲期盡善盡美，自屬不能，我人即在全力援助菲政府，使菲律賓成爲一完全之獨立國家。</p>

<p>掃除最後障碍期光榮和平郭培爾說明作戰目標</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　穗宣傳部長郭培爾，在最近期之德意志雜誌中，以「最後之陣碍」爲題，發表論文稱：反軸心各國皆依照其各別之目的作戰，而與其夥伴間之目的之矛盾，有時更甚於與軸心國家者。苟吾人回溯於戰爭之始，其所以使敵方陣營一怒而　之問題，現已消滅至毫無踪跡，此實足使吾人驚異不置者也。關於對戰爭之觀念，在目前以至戰事結束爲止，或將發生根本變更之可能性之說法，五人是否可以拒絕之，換言之，即現物乃置鎔爐中，其或將直至和平之來臨仍留於該爐而不變，而事實上此次戰爭之最後秘密，或至停止敵對行動之後始能揭發，而目前戰爭仍爲最　人驚奇之事件也。故企圖預言將來戰局之綫索，乃並無關切者，因於人力所能影響之外，有决定之因素存焉。但一方面必須依照預定之計劃以行事，而於實現此項計劃之方法，則必須儘可能使其富有彈性。敵人竭力證明彼等之作戰之目的，專係以道德上之動機所推動，實際上次種企圖，乃僅係陳列樹窗而已。反軸心陣營內部影響之變更，則其作戰目的亦必隨之而變，所幸軸心國方面之作戰目的，仍能保持其戰初之目的，即求其人民之生存，能以「一個國族之形式而存在」而作戰而已。同時敵人陣營中之政治危機，仍居首要，絕無辦法足以制止之，倫敦以工人未得商聯會領袖之同意，而竟自己要求罷工而感驚具，此英工人不過僅係實行其政府所予彼等之理論上之教訓而已。吾人並不明白英政府旣與克里姆林宮無限制之合作，而工人依布爾希維克主義之訓條以行動，而英政府竟感覺驚異者，但此種發展出於某種程度以外，而成爲全不受制而任意行動者矣。吾人曾讀被德軍所俘之英兵言論，該項言論力爲極端悲觀者，謂英人不能明瞭戰爭之意義，亦不知和平之目的，而英兵及其軍官等謂彼等希望遲早能與德軍駢肩共同對布爾希維克主義作戰。抱此作戰目的者之英兵，故不願於卡西諾之德軍機關槍砲火中熟心前進，英人仍以對德軍在義境勇猛作戳而驚奇乎，此爲英人並不預見其有此種之可能性，而英工人亦知其絕無改善其生活標準之希望。但德人以數世紀傳統之習慣爲新觀念而奮戰，而德人均知此次戰爭之危險，故獲得極大之效果，德認雖於第五年之戰爭感到憂慮，此乃係表示其內心之錢靜，而爲現世無可比擬之英雄模範者也。吾人淸算最後之障礙以達最後决定之時問終將來臨，過此最後之一躍，德人之救主即在彼岸·因該方面有光明之和平世界也，此種和平係値得吾人之奮鬥及犧牲者</p>
<h3>克里米亞半島　展開爭奪戰　通林堡鐵路綫激戰中</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社軍息：爭奪克里米亞半島之戰事，現在兩點進行，其一在寇許附折米斯里達持山麓，其二在茜伐希附近之低地，韃靼人志願兵在該處與德軍駢肩作戰。尼科拉埃夫與哥維爾問之戰事益趨激烈，惟全局並無變化，德國空軍因氣候惡劣，未能　前數日之活躍。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社雷　海通社訊：東綫戰事重心，現在泰謹波爾與波羅斯科洛夫Proskurov之間及勃洛華Brody附近·蘇方出動半力軍，似欲自波羅斯科洛　向林堡（Lemberg）採取雙重側面攻勢。考維爾西北蘇軍攻勢業已　止，維特勃斯克之第二次防守戰中亦　攻不逞。</p>
<h3>德軍在卡西諾築成新防綫</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　據海通社稱：穗軍已在卡西諾用重兵器，築成新防綫一道，故過去數日來德軍砲隊極爲活躍，某砲位於星期三平均每分鐘發砲六十發，反軸心軍最初進攻時，成羣結隊企圖長驅直入，但於獲得教　後，不得不改變其進攻之戰術。</p>
<h3>維蘇威火山　噴岩增劇　巴里爲濃烟籠罩</h3>
<p>米蘭二十四日中央社電　據南義來訊：維蘇威火山之噴射，於二十二日增劇，其溶岩流已寬達三百公尺，深及二十七公尺。那不勒斯灣全部已爲濃密烟霧所籠罩，聖巴斯提亞諾麥薩其爾可那等地之村莊，槪爲灰色之溶岩流所掃蕩，夾帶無數岩石溶岩，自火山之西南斜坡</p>
<h3>第二戰綫開闢前　歐洲空戰的激化</h3>
<p>美</p>
<p>美國的特色，在於用大型轟炸機的大編隊在良好天氣實行白畫轟炸。其轟炸機爲空中要塞「里倍當泰」，裝甲及戰鬥武器均此英機爲優，不多　燒夷彈，在白晝容易找尋目標，故光照準目標欲挪彈。在白書轟炸中，常被德國戰鬥機截擊，故美轟炸機具有强大的戰鬥力，並用大編隊與戰鬥機交戰。</p>
<p>在去年的許凡福爾特轟炸中，美國的犧牲極大，之後乃暫擇多雲的白晝，並以挪威及其他近距離地點爲目標。後來又用長距離戰鬥機在天氣晴朗的時候出擊。據最近發表，現已使用一種新的裝置，雖在多雲的天氣亦能透過雲層照準。但似不十分正確。</p>
<p>英空軍大臣辛克萊在去年十月曾說：「向同一塲所，英國在夜間作區域轟炸，美國在白畫作瞄準轟炸。英美協力轟炸的理想，正在結合雙方的特色。但在今日，美國爲了避免犧牲，亦採用英國式的夜問轟炸法，這是値得注目的。</p>
<p>德</p>
<p>一九四一年的德國轟炸英國，其特色可得而奉者，不像今日的英國道樣持有區域轟炸的觀念，利用歐洲前進其地的電波正確飛行；重視行動範圍，不裝載炸彈至限度。但因對蘇戰中轟炸機的必要，英國的電波探知機，地上防空設備，戰鬥機邀擊方法的發達等，而不能不中止。當時的德國，不像今日的英國這樣以轟炸都市作爲戰略轟炸，而以爲有最大的重要性者，此亦爲其理由之一。然最近的連續轟炸倫敦，實爲壯舉。偷敦人士將重嘗昔日恐怖的日子。</p>
<p>現在穗國的轟炸技術，其詳木得而知。但最近的轟炸倫敦，不僅完分採用子英國所取的方法，且又加上德國本身之優秀技術。其新的特色，如編成大隊以備與英國戰鬥機交戰。並用大隊集中轟炸；選擇惡劣天氣的里夜，採用　導機；在倫敦上空飛行極高，而用急降轟炸機實施有效的轟炸，（據英國的報道，急降轟炸機的聲音在倫敦市中心也可以　到）：採用迂迥戰法此備戰鬥機的邀擊；採用側身而飛的戰法以避高射砲等。飛機有新造的四引擊亨克爾一七七式，二一七式，梅塞施密斯一一〇及二一〇式　，每式均各有其特殊的目的，其速力之速，使英國戰鬥機不能邀擊。</p>
<p>從英國的東南部攻擊柏林，與從北法荷蘭攻擊倫敦，在距離上，德方較爲有利，所以飛機的生產量如其相等，則轟炸戰是德方佔優的。</p>
<p>英美德轟炸技術的比較，略如上述。那麼都市轟炸的目的何在呢？英美方面所企圖的。乃在破壞德國的生產力，以削低戰力，準備第二戰錢，及破壤德國人的士氣等。關於破壤生產力，據英　的報道，約爲三成，其中直接破壞工廠者佔其十分之九，其餘爲一般的混亂，破壞工人住宅。破壞父通。據德方報道，其損書率大見減　，工廠之被書者，優先加以修理，而工人住宅，交通問題則一致以爲是大問題。英美方面亦因爲德國的疏散工商與改組獲得成功，故對於用空襲來破壞生產力，亦無確信而希望能夠破壞士氣。</p>
<p>說到精神的效果，反使德國人十引起敵愾心而愈固其士氣。但其具有惡劣影響一面，則無論如何不能否認。</p>
<p>至於德國對英轟炸的目的，一面固然是報墾，一面也是妨害登陸作戰的集中準備。對於英國的人心與生產力究有何種影響，此非賴轟炸更强化繼續下去，不能明瞭，但至少在生產力的破壞上，損害的程度如果相同，則其在英國的影響　比較在德國更大。但像德英這樣的大國，是否僅用轟炸可使之屈膝，依現在爲止的經騐，說　是不可能的。</p>
<p>今日的都市轟炸，由於英國的戰略轟炸的觀念，而與以前大不相同。此亟應以其人之道衆諸其人之身。同時，轟炸機的損失，亦有忽視的傾向。在飛機生產力發達的今日，約十分之一的損害，確不足東視，就英美方面的數字而觀，從去年五月至十月　轟炸還沒有今日這樣劇烈　但美國喪失空中要塞五百五十三架，乘員五千人，英國喪失重轟炸機于二百八十八架，乘員一萬一千人。自十一月起，更爲猛烈。在這意義上，無綫電操縱轟炸機如在德國實現，則都市轟炸的激烈，將更有劉時期的進展。（完）（翔：譯自三月四日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>印國民軍</h3>
<p>在日軍協力之卜，卒已踏入祖國領士，吾等多年從事祖國獨立運動之同志，逖聽之下。無不極感興奮。回顧十餘年前，余在國內從事秘密運動，幾遭　軍逮捕者，即爲此次才更的宛河地方，當時緊追不捨者爲央人偵探六名，余畫夜潛伏於黑暗之業林地帶，不飲不食者達數日之久，最後始得脫險，逃抵緬甸，再轉輾至日。當時余逃命之所，此次竟成爲“軍協助吾人進擊之門戶，實覺無上欣喜。當時余聞知日軍在中部細印國境展開攻勢，頗以是否得能渡過更的宛河爲念，至今業巳安然</p>
<h3>突破難關</h3>
<p>心　頓爲一寬，英美人素來怕死，故作戰時每　使其他民族先打前陣，然又恐印人部隊有叛反之虞，乃調派渝軍來印，然父不安心，更遠調西非軍前來增防，以　非洲軍必可忍耐，　印國境之惡劣環境，其實非洲之風土與阿薩密　方　全不同，以英美渝非等精神上亳不一致之部隊，以與解放亞洲之日印軍抵抗，失敗自所必然，渡過更的宛河穿越阿薩密洲，即爲印　獨立運動發祥地之孟加拉，日印軍進抵孟加拉後，此時印度之獨立遝動，必有飛躍開展。</p>

<h3>緬印邊境作戰　日軍勝利確定　松島部長發表談話</h3>
<p>駐華日艦隊報道部長松島大佐，昨（二十四日）循例在海軍武官府接見中國記者團·發表談話，　將部長所談各點，扼要錄左：</p>
<h3>印緬作戰影響重大</h3>
<p>英美對組甸反攻宣傳已久但目前戰　，已　定敗續，其原因實在英美內部衝突，英美對海軍力與船舶之使用方面，意見鑿枘，致日軍在細甸獲得勝利喝彼以海軍力與船舶儘量使用於細印方面，遂影響太平洋方面海戰，　馬紹爾島·拉巴爾兩處敵軍，迄無大進展，目造作戰失敗，實基於和甸敗績之影響。</p>
<h3>里多公路建設失敗</h3>
<p>因日軍在緬甸勝利，促進印度迅速獨立，大東亞民族大團結，而使重壓遠征軍毫無發展，初敵方對里多公路之建設抱極大希望，自緬戰失敗以來，此項希望，巳被日軍粉碎無餘。反之日海陸軍無論緬甸或太平洋方面，已　於　著有利地位，吾人對未來之戰况，惟不　加以過奢之推測，但在緬作戰勝利，目前業已　定。</p>
<h3>安達曼等兩島現况</h3>
<p>本報向松島部良提出安達曼與尼科巴諸烏前綫之戰况問期，部長解釋謂：該兩地區爲日海軍防衛細甸之前哨基地，日軍無論在空防及海防上均極重視、防衛嚴密，敵决難得　。今年開始，　迭以航空軍力進犯，但均爲日海察將士從容擊退，敵如欲進攻該兩地區，非以極太之海空力不可，揆諸英美之目前狀况，當無能力在該地冒險嘗試。</p>
<h3>英美爭阿拉伯石油</h3>
<p>部長嗣又談及阿拉伯之石油問題，謂二美總統羅斯福、近嘗對記者談，美國石油近　缺乏，將在阿拉伯採取之，吾人對羅氏此言，可預料將發生左述各問題</p>
<p>甲·在石油問題上，英美不但在目前起衝突，即戰後亦難停止，並須更加尖銳化，永續不已。</p>
<p>乙，美制霸世界之野望，將達到阿拉伯，並在該地與英方發生衛突。</p>
<p>丙，美保存國內石油預備將夾應用，因此引起石油商之反感。</p>
<p>丁，對整個回教徒發生問題。回教聖都麥加，爲回教徒所敬崇之聖地，决難任令　美發購，英美　突，必引起回教徒大反感，</p>
<p>戊，美將以阿拉伯海爲海軍策源地，在此處可向太平洋與大西洋發展，並聞美在阿拉伯儲藏一百萬桶之石油，（每桶包容約二十加侖）將以此力量用以對英</p>
<h3>任軍部長之印象</h3>
<p>松島部長繼又談：四月一日爲中國海軍節，彼最近與海軍部任援道氏會見之印象。部長謂：日昨於某交宴會席上會見任部長，對於仟部畏之政躬康他，態度雍穆，甚感愈快與欽祟。聞任部長與中國李文忠公有戚誼，李文忠公於六十二歲時嘗書一聯難任部長，勉任氏將來成爲軍，糢範。斯時任氏正在富年。任陸軍聯隊長，對文忠公勉勵·甚　拜納，時至今日。任部長巳榮任中國海陸軍之首要人物對於整個中國海軍吾人必得觀任部長之鴻猷，關於中國海軍現狀，吾將另爲文詳細發表，並附照片，以告關心中國海軍人七。</p>
<h3>拉巴爾區男女莫辦</h3>
<p>最後松島部長發衣　趣談；吾最近會見　方自拉巴爾前綫返滬之某報道班員彼謂美軍無論在何處作戰，常發生婦女問題，同日軍則否，吾詢其原因，彼師吾在拉巴爾工作已月餘，並未一見該處之土女爲何模樣，因拉巴爾之男女服飾如一，雌雄莫辯，因之日軍亦不致發生婦女問題、</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>銀錢業健康問題</h3>
<p>兩個多月以來，本市銀錢業的資金週轉，由於中樞金融機關的積極收縮通貨，限制放款，不復像以前那樣的靈活：一般淺見者，每以此爲銀錢業病，殊不知銀錢業的健康問題，不望於資金羅用的數字，而是繫　資金運用的途徑，猶如人體的健康，不當以其肌肉的肥碩爲象徵，而當以其肌肉的緊　爲衡準。銀錢業本身經濟信用的過度膨脹，其結果正如人體的一盛壯而愈危。</p>
<p>市自有銀錢業以來，恐怕沒有像戰爭以來的出於常態了，無論是在外表上，或是在實質上。自外表言，銀行錢莊實在太多了，多得供過於求！自　質言，銀錢業的業務，除了少數的正當業者，差不多沒有一家不是染指揰足於投機的經營，我們固早經逆料其必有山窮水盡的一日。</p>
<p>爲銀錢業的本身設想，爲整個的國計　生設想，我們依然堅持我們的一貫主張，就是銀錢業一而厲行自肅，一面實行合併。日本戰時經濟體制中的銀行合併辦法，我們早就應當引爲模楷。而日大藏省最近正式决定廢止普通銀行之支行及辦事處，尤足以告訴我們戰時銀行配置之亟宜合理化。</p>
<h3>當局積極加强　各地運輸機構　大宗物資將源源滬</h3>
<p>本市各　同　公會爲媒同業福利，持久穩定工商業起見，會經分別　請各主管當局：　充分配給物資。　澈底改善評價制度。　協助採辦製成品或　料，頗博得當局之切實同情。，據記者自權威方面探悉，關於充分配給物資一節，當局嗣後將視物資來源而定，目前甫在積極加强各地運輸機構，故預料此後各種物資運滬　量，可望次第增加。問時對於協助商人向國內各　區採辦工作，當局樂予進行。</p>
<h3>物資會决定　調查皂燭火柴</h3>
<p>物資調查委員會於昨（廿四）日下午三時在該會事務所，舉行第十次全體委員會議，　席者全體中日委員，由實業部次長姜佐宣主席報吿最近調查工作情形後，當即討論　案結果，關於肥皂火柴洋燭三項物資之存貨量及生產量業，由各該業商塡報，彙由各有關各業公　申報完畢，呈請行政院鑒核備查，經提會議决再行派員實地調查，如查有申報不　及隱匿不報者，即行嚴厲處分。又今後調查　他物資侯呈請行政院核示决定云。</p>
<h3>金融處將檢查　金融機關</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行檢查金融事　處　取締國　穩　物價業資金投入生產事　起見，自製訂限制金融　開放款業務後，各金融　　均已　照拒絕主要商品抵押放款及緊縮非必要之一切放款。該處為防止金融機關　　　遠　中　优投機　積及經營非正當投資　務，一面　施檢查限目，無論任何金融　　　時派員檢查·以資督促·改正金融業務·而　資金正當運用云。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雙雄書洪　洋譯</p>
<p>天空海闊（一）</p>
<p>炎熱的，但是一個明期的睛天。大　堂　被紅白的幔幕和彩旗點　着，正裝敎官的勳章輝煌着，同此不很相配合的文官敎官們的大禮轄，帶紋章的禮服的敎官夫人們，以及新畢衆生同全體的學生們，都靜肅的整列着。</p>
<p>御差遣宮殿下，作御召軍艦，到着碼頭，　砲聲中，奏着日本國歌。殿下偕同米內海相侍從武官等，在各　致最敬禮之下進人大　堂。</p>
<p>不久「立正」的喇叭響了，可知殿下已經就座了，躍續着舉行嚴肅地畢　典禮的情形，只好讓讀者們去想像便可知道了。</p>
<p>然而眞人只從校長那裏領到了畢業教書，從侍武官手中，並沒受到恩賜的短劍，這是事實。他雖然不是劣等生，但也不是一個優等生。他唯一的自慰，也不過在畢業前從講道館得到二段的免許。</p>
<p>畢業式終了後，殿下便回到艦上去了。各員俱奉送到不見御召艦的艦影以後。繼續着號令一下，新畢業生好像脫兎一般，飛跑到學生館去了。在那兒有少尉候補生的新軍服在候等着他們。雖不很寬，打結　的全綫一條在袖頭的煌耀着。軍帽上茗荷的微章，重重地放着金色的光芒。</p>
<p>換好衣服的新候補生，滿面浮着含羞的微笑，陸續地從學生館出來了。</p>
<p>「恭喜！」</p>
<p>敎官，學生，敎官夫人，連小孩子們也聲聲地嚷着怎橡的面皮厚的人，也要變成紫紅色的。</p>

<h3>震旦大學　新藏圖書珍籍</h3>
<p>— 羅逸民</p>
<p>震旦大學最近得劉體智先生捐贈巨書四部，均為研究中國文獻及語言學之珍籍，巳於前日起陳列該校語學圖書館，以供觀覽。劉氏乃當代宿儒，家學淵源，其尊人秉章公係遜淸咸豐年間碩儒，任四川總督有年，歿後　賜「文莊」，所撰「劉文莊公奏議」八卷及「靜軒筆記」四卷，由體智先生付梓，即今珍籍之前二種也。另二種卷軼浩繁，係體智失生所撰著，為硏究中國靑銅銘刻之珍籍。一為「善齊吉金錄」，凡二十有八冊，內戰靑銅之圖畫及銘刻數千輻，均為劉氏昔年或現有藏物。一為「小校經閣」，凡十八冊，係六千五百餘件古銅銘刻之眞跡拓本，附以現代抄本，前人之註解，及劉氏本人之批訂。現代中國語言學者，凡關切中國書法史及用科學方法，解釋中國文字與碑銘者，對於劉氏斯著，决不可等閑視之。</p>
<p>關於古字之解釋，許愼著有「說文解學」，惟觀其書中所列各字體，可　其所知之古銅器及銘刻，為數有限。自澳以降，史書對於古銅之發現，時有道及。迨至宋代，始擴大蒐集，而决意對於銘刻，請求解釋。惟至晚淸，乃有長足之進步。關於銅器收藏之書籍，出版甚多，拓印銘刻，並作註解。然所刋拓本，往往為手抄本而非原本。刋物之增多，係因各著名廢墟銅器發掘日多所致，雖至今日，仍有此種趨勢。而在此類刋物之中，當以劉氏之畢生著作，為集其大成。</p>
<p>劉氏精通文史經典，於小學尤所精硏，對於古代銘刻若千章節，作精確之解釋，發前人所未發。氏不僅為中國文史之大家，其著作中，且表現現代科學之精神：即某種見解，無論其由來若何久遠，若與近年來經由縝密硏究與發掘所得之種種材料相抵觸，即毅然棄之，絕無猶豫。要之，劉氏實為東方文化之傳人。今者以上述四書，贈與震旦大學，使大多數人士，咸有觀摩之機會，誠足感謝也。</p>

<h3>Unification of Schools and Factories</h3>
<p>On January 31 of this year, the Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee held a meeting to discuss the direction of schools, deciding on the facilities of industrial schools, striving to make full use of existing equipment, or utilizing the equipment of nearby industrial schools. On the 16th of this month, the Industrial Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan decided to move to factories for teaching. In mid-April, more than 40 students from the Department of Electrical Engineering of the university, under the guidance of Professor Nobuyoshi Kato, will stay in a certain factory of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, engage in the practice of weapons production during the day, and attend lectures by various professors at night. (See the 17th edition of this newspaper). This kind of student life that merges schools and factories into one, and the spirit of combining teaching, learning, and doing into one, and the new atmosphere of the Japanese authorities who "must decide on what is discussed, must act on what is decided, and must act quickly on what is implemented," is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Increased production is needed in wartime, and the meaning of increased production is increased manpower and increased material resources. The increase of manpower is more important than the increase of material resources, and the increase of technical personnel is even more important than other talents. Only with manpower can we fully utilize existing material resources, supplement insufficient material resources, and create new material resources; and those who can come up with ideas and guide the work are technical personnel. The responsibility of technical personnel in the rear is no less than that of the soldiers on the front line. If the production in the rear cannot meet the quantity consumed on the front line, the war will inevitably decline and be exhausted. The importance of technical personnel is such that making full use of existing technical personnel and striving to cultivate future technical personnel is something that the government authorities should always pay attention to, especially in wartime, when no step can be relaxed and no moment can be wasted.</p>
<p>Our allied nation Japan has already solved this problem, and the solution is the unification of factories and schools. Existing technical personnel, whether factory technicians or school professors, bear two responsibilities: on the one hand, striving to increase national production, and on the other hand, striving to cultivate the next generation of talents. At the same time, students also bear two responsibilities: on the one hand, striving to study hard to become a technical talent in the future, and on the other hand, striving to work hard to increase national production now. Regardless of the effort in any aspect, whether it is teaching, learning, or doing, everything is centered on the war. This is the wartime system, this is the fighting spirit.</p>
<p>China's industry was originally backward, the number of factories is not large, and technical personnel are even more lacking. Therefore, a plan to make full use of these few manpower and material resources to seek future development is even more necessary and urgent. We have previously proposed the method of "on-the-job training," and also proposed the idea of using enemy-owned factories that have been returned to government management to cultivate talents. We now hope that entrepreneurs across the country, following the Japanese method, will voluntarily request the cooperation of university professors and students, formulate plans according to the nature of their own businesses, and assist in the advancement of technical talents in certain departments or parts. This is a beneficial work for the country, for themselves, for the present, and for the future. At the same time, the government should always strive to help the progress of enterprises, provide conveniences for enterprises, and reward the talents cultivated in this way.</p>
<h3>The Imperial Headquarters Officially Announced that the Japanese Army Has Entered India and is Fiercely Attacking Delhi with the Force of a Raging Tide</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 9:00 PM last night: Our army, currently fighting near the central Indo-Burmese border, is continuing its annihilation battle against the British-Indian 17th Division in the vicinity of Tonzang, and is supporting the advance of the Indian National Army. In mid-March, it broke through the Indo-Burmese border and has now entered India. Since March 5th, the enemy has invaded parts of northern Burma with airborne troops. Our army has been chasing and suppressing them everywhere and has annihilated some of them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which is fighting near the central Burmese-Indian border, has further emphasized the annihilation battle against the British-Indian 17th Division around Tonzang and Tiddim, and has also supported the activities of the Indian National Army. Since mid-March, it has repeatedly broken through the Indian border line and is now continuing its valiant attack on Delhi with the force of a raging tide. On March 8th, the Japanese and Indian armies launched a preemptive attack in the central border area of the Kaderwan Valley and the Chin Hills area. They encircled a superior enemy force, mainly the British-Indian 17th Division, in Tonzang, Tiddim, and the Nyukte Mountain area to the north, resulting in an annihilation battle. Around March 15th, after putting the enemy in a desperate situation, they forced them to retreat to the border. The powerful Japanese troops and the elite troops of the Indian National Army near Mindat, northeast of the Chin Hills, responded together, destroying the British-Indian 23rd Division deployed in the area, and broke through the Indian border from the north and south of Dami. On the 17th, they had penetrated deep into Indian territory, destroying the enemy strongholds of Kongkang and Khampat on the western slope of the Patkai Mountains. The current situation on the Burmese border has changed from the traditional Burmese defense operation to an Indian offensive operation. The incomparably strong Japanese and Indian armies are fiercely attacking the core of the enemy's East Indian defense force.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain place on the Indo-Burmese border, the Japanese and Indian troops are still continuing their attack in the Kabaw Mountain area, threatening the enemy's 20th and 23rd Divisions and part of the 17th Division, and fiercely attacking the enemy's important southern stronghold of Wittku. The enemy army carried out counterattacks with tanks and planes, but the Japanese army repeatedly attacked them and finally captured the area on the 19th, and immediately headed north, fiercely pursuing the defeated enemy. At the same time, the dare-to-die squads of the Japanese and Indian armies, in order to cut off the enemy's retreat route in a certain area, advanced towards Indian territory and blew up a certain bridge on the night of the 19th, completely cutting off the retreat route of the enemy's 20th and 23rd Divisions. The enemy division in the Kabaw area also lost its retreat route as a result. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from the south, and the enemy army in that area is now in danger of being annihilated.</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Japanese Military Authorities: The Encirclement is Narrowed, and British Paratroopers are Annihilated Near Gaza</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, the Japanese army authorities announced on the 23rd that the Japanese army has launched a large-scale operation. The main points are as follows: Regarding Burma, the enemy's YU (Chongqing), British, and American forces are clamoring to retake Burma, eyeing it covetously, and have begun to move restlessly in the vicinity of the Indo-Burmese border. Therefore, since last autumn, we have strengthened our combat power and carried out preemptive attacks in all aspects. First, we annihilated the YU 36th Division in the Nujiang area, crushing its counterattack attempt. Also, since the end of October last year, the YU, British, and American forces have attempted to advance to the Dangong area. Our army severely damaged the enemy with clever operations. In February of this year, we inflicted great damage on the main force of the enemy's 15th Army Corps in the Arakan area. Then, in March, we chased and suppressed the main force of the enemy's 4th Army Corps in the Chin Hills area. In this way, we completely crushed the enemy's counterattack attempt and were able to ensure the stability of Burma, achieving the initial defense purpose within the scope of preventing the war from expanding further. However, the enemy army not only continues to send troops to various places to continue stubborn counterattacks, but also since March 5th, has dropped parachute troops near Gaza in a part of northern Burma, threatening the rear of our army, and again causing the area that has restored peace to fall into war, and carrying out various atrocities to bully innocent civilians. The Japanese army in Burma, in view of the above situation, decided to thoroughly destroy the enemy's counterattack base in eastern India. The Indian National Army has crossed the Indo-Burmese border after our army launched the annihilation battle in central Arakan Chin Hills, so our army is supporting the National Army in these advances. At the same time, we are also thoroughly supporting the independence and liberation battle of the Provisional Government of Free India. The purpose of our army's offensive operation is to destroy the enemy who intends to counterattack in East India and to defeat the British, American, and YU armies. We do not consider India and the Indian people as enemies. Japan has no territorial ambitions. Every inch of land occupied by our army is prepared to be returned to Free India. At present, the enemy in the Tonzang area has been annihilated, and we are continuing to rapidly advance against the enemy vanguard in various areas near Lium, Kabaw Creek. We have broken through the Burmese-Indian border. Also, the attack from Haka towards the key point of the Bay of Bengal is progressing according to the planned steps. Therefore, the enemy troops who landed near Gaza have been annihilated by several hundred as of today, and our encirclement is being narrowed at every moment. In short, our army's attack on India has not been hindered in any way, and the forces on the southwest coast are becoming more substantial, and a strong battle formation has been completed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, the Japanese army bomber squadron in Burma departed from a certain base on the morning of the 16th and enthusiastically attacked the enemy's important strongholds on the central Burmese-Indian border and the enemy's airfield north of Imphal, using heavy bombs to fiercely bomb the runway and airfield facilities. Three locations were hit and caught fire, and a large fire occurred in one location. Another unit fiercely bombed a convoy of enemy vehicles speeding on the highway between Imphal and Palel, causing the enemy to be terrified. Also, several large formations of Japanese aircraft attacked the airfields of Imphal, Palel, and Itmiyu in a large-scale attack on the morning of the 17th, setting fire to three Douglas B-C3 aircraft and one small aircraft on the ground. At the same time, they engaged in fierce air combat with a dozen or so enemy P40 and Spitfire aircraft, shooting down five Spitfire aircraft, and inflicting annihilating damage on the enemy's Ang army in the area. One Japanese aircraft each was bombed and did not return, and one aircraft was damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Bougainville Continue Fierce Attacks; Enemy Aircraft Thwarted in Raids on Rabaul</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 24th: Our army units on Bougainville Island began attacking approximately one division of enemy troops defending the solid semi-permanent fortifications near Torokina in early March. After fierce fighting, they seized a part of the enemy's fortifications and are currently continuing their attack under the enemy's fierce artillery fire.</p>
<p>Rabaul, 24th (Central News Agency) – Enemy carrier-based bombers and fighters launched a large-scale attack on Rabaul on the 22nd. The Japanese garrison troops immediately engaged them in combat, shooting down four carrier-based bombers. The land damage on the Japanese side was minor.</p>
<h3>The Foundation for the Independence and Liberation of India has Been Laid; The Provisional Government Issued a Special Statement</h3>
<p>Shonan, 24th (Central News Agency) – After Prime Minister Tojo clarified Japan's determination to fully support India's independence, the spokesman of the Provisional Government of Free India issued a special statement on the 23rd as follows: Prime Minister Tojo's speech is of profound significance in the current situation. When the Free Indian National Army and the Japanese army cooperated closely and began to attack their motherland India, Prime Minister Tojo clearly stated that Japan had no territorial or political ambitions for India. After the Japanese army defeated the enemy's forces, it would completely hand over India to the Indians. This statement has not only shattered Britain's anti-Japanese propaganda within India, but also made the people of India deeply aware of the agreement that the territory of India acquired by the National Army will be immediately placed under the administration of the Free Provisional Government. Therefore, the anti-British struggle is becoming more active, and it is believed that the Indian army in the country will automatically take a cooperative attitude. We are well aware that after Britain and the United States invaded Italy under the guise of liberating the country, they immediately promulgated military administration by their own troops, causing the Italian people to complain. Japan, on the other hand, adheres to the moral attitude of repaying love with love and friendship with friendship, so it is completely different from Britain and the United States. Japan's noble spirit will soon be fully rewarded by the Indian people. The statements of Prime Minister Tojo and Chairman Bose can further intensify the anti-British consciousness of the people in India. The union of the two peoples will become more and more consolidated, and it is believed that the foundation for independence and liberation has been laid firmly and will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Shonan, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 25,000 Indians residing in Shonan were extremely excited to learn that the Indian National Army had entered the territory of the Manipur princely state. On the evening of the 23rd, a mass rally was held, gathering about 6,000 Indians, who listened quietly to the report and speech by Minister Alagappan of the Department of Non-Intervention of the Provisional Government. Then, Lieutenant Colonel Nagar, on behalf of the masses, expressed his gratitude to the Japanese Tojo. Finally, the meeting was adjourned after chanting Chairman Bose's declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Saigon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Indian Independence League established a branch in Saigon last summer. On the first anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government on the 21st of this month, a branch was established in Hanoi. Baidu is rushing to the branch, and the nearest will also be established.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Commander Koshiba of the Navy Delivers a Speech at the Party Training Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Central Party Affairs Training Corps invited Lieutenant Commander Koshiba of the allied Navy to the corps at 3:00 PM today (the 23rd) to give a special lecture entitled "The Pacific War Situation." He gave a detailed analysis of the recent situation and progress of the Pacific War, which lasted for more than an hour. Also, at 4:30 PM on the same afternoon, the corps's Director Chen personally presided over a meeting to summon the students of the third and sixth squads for individual talks.</p>
<h3>Report on the Exploration Work of the Japanese-Manchukuo Resource Survey Team in Mengjiang: New Discovery on the Formation of Salt Lakes</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – After Manchuria organized a resource survey team composed of authorities in the Manchu scientific community last year, it carried out large-scale exploration work in Mengjiang Dabus and other places. The team held a research report meeting at the Continental Science Institute of Manchuria on the 19th of this month, during which Mr. Shigemitsu Okada of the Geological Research Institute and Mr. Jun Yamane of the Continental Science Institute respectively reported on the exploration results. Mr. Okada's report was entitled "On the Genesis of Salt Lakes," and Mr. Yamane's report was entitled "The Composition of the Water of Lake Dabus." According to reports, the captain of the resource survey team was Dr. Shinoo Itano, an agricultural scholar from the Continental Science Institute, and the team members were scientists dispatched by Manchukuo and the Japan Science Mobilization Association. They arrived at the site on May 29th last summer, and after detailed investigation for more than three months, they determined the essence of the lake water. In addition, other important resources were also discovered. Only trial excavation has been carried out on underground resources, and there is already full confidence in the future. Also, Mr. Okada's "On the Genesis of Salt Lakes" determined that Lake Dabus is a chlorine-only salt lake. Two hundred million years ago, the area was a large marsh. Later, due to crustal movement, mountains were formed. After the seawater flowing to the lowlands dried up, it evaporated into salt. Mr. Okada also collected fossils of fish and shellfish as proof. Regarding the composition of the water of Lake Dabus, Mr. Yamane has reported on the analysis of a part of the water quality and confirmed that the lake contains rare elements and other important resources. Dr. Itano, an agricultural scholar, said that Lake Dabus in Mengjiang is a large salt lake in Mengjiang, and its salt content is the highest in the world. The surface of the lake seems to be covered with a thick layer of salt water about one meter thick, and the entire lake surface is a crystal of salt. The density of the salt is also very high.</p>

<h3>Half a Year of Philippine Independence; The Belief in Cooperation is Stronger than Ever; Ambassador Murata's Remarks to Japanese Journalists</h3>
<p>Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Murata met with a group of Japanese journalists yesterday and made a statement on the recent situation of the Philippines' active cooperation with Japan since the birth of the Philippine government half a year ago, saying that since the independence of the Philippines, half a year has passed in an instant. The key figures of the Philippine Republic government and Japan have become more firm in their belief in a common destiny. In accordance with the spirit of the Japan-Philippine Alliance Treaty, they have strengthened the Philippines' combat strength, material resources, and defense posture, which is truly commendable. President Laurel said, "Without Japan's victory, the Philippines cannot be completely independent." This belief is not only clearly recognized within the Philippine government, but also generally affirmed by the Filipino people. Therefore, the Filipino people's cooperation with Japan is now more solid. The Filipino people previously relied on the economic power of the United States to live a comfortable life, but now they seem to be experiencing various economic hardships under wartime. However, the Filipino people have cultivated a spirit of self-reliance, enduring hardships and actively solving this problem. For example, in the current food problem in the Philippines, the Filipino people have also abandoned their bystander attitude and have moved forward to cooperate with the policies adopted by the government, automatically reclaiming vacant land, and recently all of it has been transformed into useful land. From this, it can be seen that the food problem in the Philippines will not be too difficult. The food problem in the Philippines is ultimately a problem of the city. If the people can actively increase production and facilitate transportation, it can be easily solved given the fertility of the Philippine land. Recently, Japanese residents in the Philippines have organized a Japanese association to respond to Japan's domestic emergency measures and have begun to provide labor services to the country. In short, the future of the Philippine government still faces many difficulties, and there are many issues that need to be improved in the future. However, the Philippine government has only been established for half a year, and it is impossible to expect perfection. We are fully assisting the Philippine government to make the Philippines a completely independent country.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of the Navy Schedules to Celebrate Navy Day; Ceremonies Held in Nanjing, Hankou, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – After the National Government returned to Nanjing in 1940, it established the Ministry of the Navy the following day (April 1st) to start unifying the naval forces scattered across the country and actively engage in the restoration and construction of the navy. On April 1st, 1942, it also convened naval officers from all over the country in Nanjing to realize the true unification of the Chinese navy. In order to commemorate these two significant anniversary days, the authorities of the Ministry of the Navy have decided to designate April 1st as Chinese Navy Day. The first Navy Day of this year is approaching in an instant. In order to express celebrations and enhance the general public's understanding of the navy, the Ministry of the Navy has scheduled to hold celebration ceremonies in Nanjing, Weihaiwei, Hankou, and other places on that day. In addition, there will be various events such as military parades, processions, performances, music, movies, and tea parties. The grand occasion will be unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Kong and Song in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency) – It is rumored that Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing has suddenly lost power in Chongqing recently. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China has been taken over by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, and his power in the financial world has been eroded. The labor dispute between Kong and Song is now in progress, and Kong seems to have gained the upper hand. According to the news received by this office, it is rumored that Kong Xiangxi will soon take office as the President of the Executive Yuan, and it has been decided to remove Song Ziwen from the post of Foreign Minister and appoint Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, to succeed him. It has also been decided to make Wei Daoming, the ambassador to the UK, resign and be succeeded by Wang Zhengting, a veteran of the diplomatic world. According to Shanghai, the strongest intention to advocate for major personnel changes is Song Meiling. It is rumored that Song is on extremely bad terms with her brother Song Ziwen recently. Their opinions on diplomacy with the United States and other issues also differ from time to time. Therefore, the dispute between the two has ultimately led to Song Ziwen's loss of power.</p>
<h3>Governor Luo of Anhui Speaks</h3>

<h3>Interview with Yin Rugeng</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Suzhou, 23rd: Yin Rugeng, Director of the Preparatory Office for Governing the Grand Canal, arrived in Suzhou on the 21st with his entourage to inspect the conditions along the Grand Canal. He immediately visited relevant authorities in the provincial capital to discuss ideas for governing the canal. A reporter paid him a visit to inquire about various points, and Mr. Yin kindly provided detailed answers as follows: (1) The first phase of the Grand Canal governance project has been decided to start with the renovation of the section from Taierzhuang to Guazhou. (2) Regarding the Xuzhou-Hai'an Canal section, it will be carefully inspected and then repaired to facilitate the smooth transportation of coal and salt from the Xuzhou and Hai'an areas. (3) The current situation of the South Grand Canal is still acceptable, but it can only accommodate ships with light tonnage, so it will be gradually renovated. Mr. Yin earnestly stated that he deeply hopes that local officials and people will work together to complete the mission, so that future north-south transportation will not rely solely on land routes. This will also facilitate the exchange of goods, stabilize people's livelihoods, and further enhance wartime people's livelihood and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Atlantic Charter Has Become a Mere Document; British Parliamentarians Express Strong Criticism</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Stockholm, 24th: According to a London dispatch: During a meeting of the British House of Commons on the 22nd, members of parliament raised numerous questions regarding British foreign policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden asked Churchill whether the British government could follow the example of the Soviet government and recognize the Batet regime. Churchill replied that the British government did not intend to change its relationship with the Batet regime. Member of Parliament Lipson then questioned whether the principles of the Atlantic Charter applied to any territory, as there was considerable doubt. He asked the Prime Minister to clarify. Churchill replied that the current war situation is constantly changing, and the documents regarding the so-called Atlantic Charter need to be re-stated. Therefore, the major Axis powers should approach the Atlantic Charter with caution. He further stated that the Atlantic Charter clarified the spirit and purpose of the Allied nations in prosecuting the war. It was not a treaty concluded by the Allied nations because of the Charter, nor was it intended to initiate negotiations between the Allied nations and the enemy.</p>
<p>Clearing the Last Obstacles to a Period of Glorious Peace Goebbels Explains War Objectives</p>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article entitled "The Last Obstacles" in the latest issue of the German magazine, stating: "The anti-Axis countries are all fighting according to their respective goals, and the contradictions between their goals and those of their partners are sometimes even greater than those with the Axis countries. If we look back to the beginning of the war, the question of what caused the enemy camp to become enraged and fall apart has now disappeared without a trace, which is truly astonishing. Regarding the notion that the concept of war may undergo fundamental changes between now and the end of the war, can we reject this? In other words, are things currently placed in the crucible to remain unchanged until the arrival of peace? In fact, the ultimate secret of this war may only be revealed after the cessation of hostilities, and the current war remains the most astonishing event. Therefore, attempting to predict the course of the war in the future is irrelevant, as there are decisive factors beyond human influence. However, on the one hand, we must act according to a predetermined plan, and on the other hand, we must make the methods of realizing this plan as flexible as possible. The enemy is trying hard to prove that their war aims are solely motivated by moral considerations, but in reality, such attempts are merely window dressing. Changes in the internal influences of the anti-Axis camp will inevitably lead to changes in their war aims. Fortunately, the war aims of the Axis countries have remained true to their original purpose from the start of the war, which is to fight for the survival of their people, 'to exist as a nation.' At the same time, the political crisis in the enemy camp remains paramount, and there is no way to stop it. London is terrified that workers are demanding strikes without the consent of trade union leaders, but these British workers are merely putting into practice the theoretical lessons their government has taught them. We do not understand why the British government, which has unlimited cooperation with the Kremlin, is surprised that workers are acting according to Bolshevik principles. However, this kind of development has gone beyond a certain degree and become completely uncontrolled and arbitrary. We have read the statements of British soldiers captured by the German army, which are extremely pessimistic, saying that the British people do not understand the meaning of the war, nor do they know the purpose of peace, and that British soldiers and officers hope that sooner or later they can join forces with the German army to fight against Bolshevism. British soldiers who hold this war aim are therefore unwilling to advance wholeheartedly under the German machine gun fire at Cassino. Are the British still surprised that the German army in Italy is fighting so bravely? This is because the British did not foresee such a possibility, and British workers also know that they have no hope of improving their living standards. However, the Germans are fighting for new ideas with centuries of traditional habits, and the Germans are all aware of the dangers of this war, so they have achieved great results. Even though the Germans are worried in the fifth year of the war, this is merely an expression of their inner prudence and a model of heroism unparalleled in the world. The time will eventually come when we clear the last obstacles to reach the final decision. After this final leap, the savior of the Germans is on the other side, because there is a bright world of peace there. This kind of peace is worth our struggle and sacrifice."</p>
<h3>Battle for the Crimean Peninsula Unfolds; Fierce Fighting on the Tonglinburg Railway Line</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Haidong News Agency military news: The battle for the Crimean Peninsula is currently taking place at two points: one in the foothills of Mount Mithridates near Kerch, and the other in the lowlands near Saki. Tatar volunteers are fighting alongside German troops in that area. The fighting between Nikolaev and Kovel is intensifying, but the overall situation remains unchanged. The German air force has not been as active as in previous days due to bad weather.</p>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: Haidong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front is now between Ternopil and Proskurov, and near Brody. The Soviet Union is deploying half its forces in an apparent attempt to launch a double flanking maneuver from Proskurov towards Lviv (Lemberg). The Soviet offensive northwest of Kovel has been halted, and the second defense of Vitebsk has also failed.</p>
<h3>German Army Builds New Defense Line in Cassino</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, 24th: According to Haidong News Agency: The Allied forces have used heavy weapons to build a new defense line in Cassino, so the German artillery has been very active in recent days. One artillery position fired an average of sixty rounds per minute on Wednesday. During the initial Allied offensive, groups of soldiers attempted to drive straight in, but after suffering heavy casualties, they had to change their tactics.</p>
<h3>Mount Vesuvius Erupts More Violently; Bari Shrouded in Thick Smoke</h3>
<p>Central News Agency telegram from Milan, 24th: According to news from Southern Italy: The eruption of Mount Vesuvius intensified on the 22nd, with the lava flow reaching a width of 300 meters and a depth of 27 meters. The entire Bay of Naples is shrouded in thick smoke. Villages such as San Sebastiano al Vesuvio and Massa di Somma have been swept away by gray lava flows, carrying countless rocks and lava from the volcano's southwest slope.</p>
<h3>Intensification of European Air Warfare Before the Opening of the Second Front</h3>
<p>America</p>
<p>The American characteristic lies in carrying out daytime bombing in good weather with large formations of large bombers. Their bombers, the "Liberator" flying fortresses, have better armor and combat weapons than British aircraft. They do not use many incendiary bombs, and they can easily find targets in the daytime, so they aim to hit the targets accurately. In daytime bombing, they are often intercepted by German fighters, so American bombers have strong combat capabilities and use large formations to engage in aerial combat.</p>
<p>In last year's Schweinfurt bombing, the American sacrifice was enormous. After that, they temporarily chose cloudy daytime and targeted Norway and other nearby locations. Later, they used long-range fighters to attack in clear weather. According to recent announcements, a new device is now in use that can aim through the clouds even in cloudy weather. But it does not seem very accurate.</p>
<p>British Air Minister Sinclair said last October: "In the same location, Britain conducts area bombing at night, and the United States conducts precision bombing in the daytime. The ideal of Anglo-American cooperation in bombing is to combine the strengths of both sides." But today, in order to avoid sacrifices, the United States is also adopting the British-style nighttime bombing method, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>The German bombing of Britain in 1941 was characterized by the fact that, unlike today's Britain, it did not have the concept of area bombing. It used radio waves to navigate accurately using forward positions in Europe, and it valued range of action, not loading bombs to the limit. But it had to stop due to the need for bombers in the war against the Soviet Union, the development of British radio wave detectors, ground air defense equipment, and fighter interception methods. At that time, Germany did not regard bombing cities as strategic bombing with the greatest importance, as Britain does today. This is also one of the reasons. However, the recent continuous bombing of London is a feat. Londoners will relive the terror of the past.</p>
<p>The details of the current German bombing technology are unknown. But the recent bombing of London not only fully adopts the methods taken by Britain, but also adds Germany's own excellent technology. Its new features include forming large formations to prepare for combat with British fighters, using large formations to concentrate bombing, choosing bad weather at night, using guided aircraft, flying extremely high over London, and implementing effective bombing with dive bombers (according to British reports, the sound of dive bombers can be heard in the center of London). They also use roundabout tactics to prepare for fighter interception and side-flying tactics to avoid anti-aircraft guns. There are newly built four-engine Heinkel 177s, 217s, Messerschmitt 110s and 210s , each with its own special purpose. Their speed is so fast that British fighters cannot intercept them.</p>
<p>Attacking Berlin from southeastern England is more advantageous to the Germans in terms of distance than attacking London from northern France and the Netherlands, so if aircraft production is equal, the bombing war favors the Germans.</p>
<p>The comparison of British, American, and German bombing technologies is briefly as described above. So what is the purpose of urban bombing? What the British and Americans are trying to achieve is to destroy Germany's production capacity to reduce its war power, prepare for the second front, and destroy the morale of the German people. Regarding the destruction of production capacity, according to British reports, it is about 30%, of which direct destruction of factories accounts for nine-tenths, and the rest is general chaos, destruction of workers' residences, and disruption of traffic. According to German reports, the loss rate has been greatly reduced, factories that are bombed are given priority for repair, and workers' residences and traffic problems are considered major problems. The British and Americans also lack confidence in using air raids to destroy production capacity because Germany has successfully dispersed industry and commerce and reorganized. They hope to be able to destroy morale.</p>
<p>As for the psychological effect, it only makes the Germans feel more hostile and strengthens their morale. But its adverse impact cannot be denied in any way.</p>
<p>As for Germany's purpose in bombing Britain, on the one hand, it is of course retaliation, and on the other hand, it is also to hinder the concentration preparations for the landing operation. What impact it has on British morale and production can only be understood if the bombing is further intensified. But at least in terms of the destruction of production capacity, if the degree of damage is the same, then its impact in Britain is greater than in Germany. But whether a large country like Germany or Britain can be forced to surrender by bombing alone is impossible to say for sure based on the experience so far.</p>
<p>Today's urban bombing is very different from before due to the concept of British strategic bombing. This should be done to them what they are doing to others. At the same time, there is also a tendency to ignore the loss of bombers. In today's world of developed aircraft production capacity, a loss of about one-tenth is indeed not enough to see. Judging from the British and American figures, from May to October the bombing was not as intense as it is today , but the United States lost 553 flying fortresses, with 5,000 crew members, and Britain lost 288 heavy bombers, with 11,000 crew members. Since November, it has become even more intense. In this sense, if radio-controlled bombers are realized in Germany, the intensity of urban bombing will have even more epoch-making progress. (The End) (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News, March 4)</p>

<h3>Temporary Rationing of Cloth; Prices Have Been Determined; Purchase Certificates to be Printed and Sold in Early May</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of temporary rationing of cotton cloth for civilian use, the National Commercial Control Association has completed preparations and will begin general rationing around early May. The Commercial Control Association has now completed the printing of purchase certificates for rationed cloth and will hand them over to the municipal government to distribute to citizens according to the rationing household system. Citizens can purchase cloth at designated retail stores by presenting the "Purchase Certificate." Each person will receive one purchase certificate per household, and each certificate can purchase 15 feet of cloth. The price of rationed cloth will be calculated at twice the purchase price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth, which is 3.75 yuan per foot, doubled to 7.5 yuan. To this, a 30% profit margin for merchants will be added, bringing the price to 9.75 yuan per foot. Finally, a 4% administrative fee will be added, bringing the final price to 10.014 yuan per foot. It is reported that there are more than 700 retail stores throughout the city that will distribute the cloth. The cloth distributed will be half of the amount reserved by each retail store for sale. If a retail store does not have enough cloth to distribute, it can apply to wholesalers for additional allocation.</p>

<h3>Indian National Army</h3>
<p>With the cooperation of the Japanese army, they have finally stepped into the territory of their homeland. All of us comrades who have been engaged in the independence movement for many years are extremely excited to hear this news. Looking back more than ten years ago, when I was engaged in underground activities in China, I was almost arrested by the army in the same area as the Koring River. At that time, six English detectives were chasing me day and night. I lurked in the dark wilderness for days without food or drink, and finally managed to escape to Burma and then to Japan. The place where I escaped at that time has now become the gateway for the Japanese army to assist us in attacking, which makes me feel extremely happy. At that time, when I learned that the Japanese army was launching an offensive in the central-Indian border, I was quite concerned about whether they would be able to cross the Koring River. Now they have safely</p>
<h3>Breaking Through Difficulties</h3>
<p>My heart is greatly relieved. The British and Americans have always been afraid of death, so they always make other ethnic groups fight in the front line first. However, they also fear that the Indian troops will rebel, so they have transferred the Chongqing army to India. However, they are still not at ease, and they have transferred the West African army from afar to reinforce the defense, because the African army can definitely endure the harsh environment of the Indian border. In fact, the climate of Africa is completely different from the Assam area. With the spiritually inconsistent troops of the British, Americans, Chongqing, and Africans resisting the Japanese and Indian armies that are liberating Asia, failure is inevitable. Crossing the Koring River and traversing the state of Assam is Bengal, the birthplace of the Indian independence movement. After the Japanese and Indian armies reach Bengal, the independence movement in India will definitely develop by leaps and bounds.</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative to be Established by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>In order to improve the lives of the police and promote police efficiency, the First Police Bureau has organized a police consumer cooperative to handle the procurement and distribution of daily necessities to stabilize the lives of the police. A fund of 40 million yuan has been requested by Director Chen in a letter to the city's banks, chambers of commerce, and citizen welfare associations for assistance and advance. Various sectors have also enthusiastically borrowed, so there are generally no problems. It is reported that the society is scheduled to be formally established on the 31st of this month and begin procurement and distribution matters.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Coal Briquette Certificates in the Seventh District Extended by Two Days</h3>
<p>Regarding the distribution of coal briquettes to households in the Seventh District of this city, the City Economic Bureau has divided the second phase of distribution of purchase certificates into eight locations and dispatched personnel to directly distribute them to citizens. It was originally scheduled to end this afternoon, but due to the large population, the Bureau has decided to extend it by two days. Tomorrow will be a day of rest, and distribution will continue on the 27th and 28th , so that all citizens will receive them. As for the date of coal briquette distribution, once the coal briquette purchase certificates have been fully distributed, it will be announced publicly. Citizens can purchase from designated stores by presenting the certificate. Each person can purchase 15 catties, priced at 8.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Implements Emergency Alert</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of wartime permanent blackout in the entire Nanshi area, all private lights in the area have been shielded and dimmed, yielding very good results. However, theft cases have occurred repeatedly. In addition to intensifying secret contact and cooperation, the Second Police Bureau has also implemented emergency alerts. A police brigade patrols thoroughly every night. At the same time, it is stipulated that each Lianbao (collective security) group's patrol team will thoroughly inspect the Lianbao under its jurisdiction all night to prevent the rise of theft.</p>

<h3>Victory of Japanese Army Confirmed in the Burma-India Border Battle Minister Matsushima Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the press minister of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with the Chinese press corps at the naval attaché's office yesterday (the 24th) as usual. The main points of the minister's statement are summarized below:</p>
<h3>Significant Impact of the India-Burma Operations</h3>
<p>The British and American propaganda about a counteroffensive in Burma has been going on for a long time, but the current battle situation has confirmed their continued defeat. The reason is the internal conflict between Britain and the United States. They disagree on the use of naval power and ships, which has led to the Japanese army's victory in Burma. Their use of naval power and ships to the greatest extent possible in the India-Burma region has affected the naval battles in the Pacific. The enemy forces at the Marshall Islands and Rabaul have made no significant progress. The failure of their operations is based on the defeat in Burma.</p>
<h3>Failure of the Ledo Road Construction</h3>
<p>The Japanese victory in Burma has promoted the rapid independence of India, the great unity of the nations of East Asia, and prevented the Allied Expeditionary Force from making any progress. The enemy initially had great hopes for the construction of the Ledo Road, but since the defeat in the Burma campaign, these hopes have been shattered by the Japanese army. On the contrary, the Japanese army and navy have already gained an advantageous position in Burma and the Pacific. We will not make extravagant predictions about the future war situation, but the victory in the Burma operations has already been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Andaman and Other Islands</h3>
<p>When this newspaper asked Minister Matsushima about the situation on the front lines of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the minister explained that these two regions are the forward bases for the Japanese navy's defense of Burma. The Japanese army attaches great importance to air and sea defense, and the defense is tight. The enemy will have a hard time succeeding. Since the beginning of this year, they have repeatedly attacked with air force, but they have all been calmly repelled by the Japanese naval officers and soldiers. If the enemy wants to attack these two regions, they must use extremely large naval and air forces. Judging from the current situation of Britain and the United States, they have no ability to take risks in these areas.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Compete for Arabian Oil</h3>
<p>The minister then talked about the problem of Arabian oil, saying that U.S. President Roosevelt recently told reporters that the United States is experiencing a shortage of oil and will exploit it in Arabia. We can predict that the following problems will arise from Roosevelt's statement:</p>
<p>A. On the oil issue, conflicts between Britain and the United States will not only arise at present, but will be difficult to stop even after the war, and will become more acute and continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>B. The United States' ambition to dominate the world will reach Arabia, and conflicts will occur there with Britain.</p>
<p>C. The United States' preservation of domestic oil reserves will cause resentment from oil merchants.</p>
<p>D. Problems will arise for the entire Muslim community. Mecca, the holy city of Islam, is a sacred place revered by Muslims, and they will not allow the United States to exploit it. Conflicts between Britain and the United States will inevitably arouse great resentment from Muslims.</p>
<p>E. The United States will use the Arabian Sea as a naval base, from which it can develop towards the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is also heard that the United States is storing one million barrels of oil in Arabia (each barrel containing about twenty gallons), and will use this power to confront Britain.</p>
<h3>Impression of Minister Ren of the Navy</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima continued by talking about his impression of meeting with Ren Yuandao, Minister of the Navy, on April 1st, the Chinese Navy Day. The minister said that he recently met Minister Ren at a social banquet and was impressed and admired by Minister Ren's health and dignified attitude. It is heard that Minister Ren is related to Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong once wrote a couplet for Minister Ren at the age of sixty-two, encouraging Ren to become a military model in the future. At that time, Ren was in his prime, serving as a regimental commander in the army, and was very grateful for Wenzhong's encouragement. Today, Minister Ren has honorably assumed the most important position in the Chinese army and navy. We must observe Minister Ren's grand plans for the entire Chinese navy. Regarding the current situation of the Chinese navy, I will publish a detailed article with photos to inform those who care about the Chinese navy.</p>
<h3>Men and Women in Rabaul Are Indistinguishable</h3>
<p>Finally, Minister Matsushima shared an interesting story: "I recently met a member of the press who had returned to Shanghai from the front lines of Rabaul. He said that the US military often has problems with women wherever they fight, but the Japanese army does not. When asked the reason, he told me that he had been working in Rabaul for more than a month and had never seen what the local women looked like, because the men and women of Rabaul dress the same and are indistinguishable. As a result, the Japanese army does not have problems with women."</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Health Problems of the Banking Industry</h3>
<p>For more than two months, the turnover of funds in the Shanghai banking industry has not been as flexible as before, due to the central financial authorities' active contraction of currency and restriction of loans. Those with superficial views regard this as a disease of the banking industry, but they do not know that the health of the banking industry does not depend on the amount of funds used, but on the way the funds are used. Just like the health of the human body, it should not be symbolized by the size of its muscles, but should be measured by the tightness of its muscles. The excessive expansion of the banking industry's own economic credit will result in the same danger as a person's excessive strength.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the banking industry in Shanghai, perhaps it has never been as abnormal as it has been since the war, whether in appearance or in substance. In terms of appearance, there are simply too many banks and money shops, so many that supply exceeds demand! In terms of substance, except for a few legitimate operators, almost every bank and money shop is involved in speculative operations. We have long predicted that there would be a day when they would run out of resources.</p>
<p>For the sake of the banking industry itself, and for the sake of the entire national economy and people's livelihood, we still adhere to our consistent position, which is that the banking industry should first practice self-discipline and then implement mergers. We should have long used the bank merger method in Japan's wartime economic system as a model. The recent formal decision of the Japanese Ministry of Finance to abolish branches and offices of ordinary banks should also tell us that the allocation of banks during wartime urgently needs to be rationalized.</p>
<h3>Authorities Actively Strengthening Transportation Institutions in Various Regions Large Quantities of Goods Will Flow to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in Shanghai, for the welfare of their members and the long-term stability of industry and commerce, have separately requested the relevant authorities to: 1. Fully allocate materials. 2. Thoroughly improve the evaluation system. 3. Assist in the purchase of finished products or raw materials. They have won the sincere sympathy of the authorities. According to reporters' inquiries from authoritative sources, regarding the full allocation of materials, the authorities will determine this based on the source of materials. They are currently actively strengthening transportation institutions in various regions, so it is expected that the amount of various materials transported to Shanghai will gradually increase in the future. At the same time, the authorities are happy to assist merchants in purchasing from various regions in the country.</p>
<h3>Materials Association Decides to Investigate Soap, Candles, and Matches</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee held its tenth plenary committee meeting at its office at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 24th). All Chinese and Japanese committee members were present. After Vice Minister Jiang Zuoxuan of the Ministry of Industry reported on the recent investigation work, the meeting immediately discussed the results. Regarding the inventory and production of soap, matches, and candles, each business was required to fill out a report, which was compiled and submitted by the relevant trade associations for submission to the Executive Yuan for review and filing. It was decided at the meeting to send personnel for an on-site investigation. Those who are found to have made inaccurate reports or concealed information will be severely punished. The investigation of other materials will be decided after submitting a request to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Finance Department Will Inspect Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office, in order to crack down on speculative hoarding and stabilize prices, has formulated restrictions on financial institutions' lending operations in order to invest funds in production. All financial institutions have refused to provide loans secured by major commodities and have tightened all unnecessary loans. In order to prevent financial institutions from engaging in speculation, hoarding, and illegal investment activities, the office has implemented inspection limits. Personnel will be dispatched to any financial institution at any time to conduct inspections, in order to supervise and correct financial operations and ensure the proper use of funds.</p>

Thanks to the cooperation of the Buddhist Congee Kitchen and the enthusiastic response from people from all walks of life and charitable organizations, who generously contributed to relieve the poor with kindness and care.

<p>- Iwata Souo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Wide Open Skies (1)</p>
<p>It was hot, but a clear and bright day. The auditorium was decorated with red and white curtains and彩旗. The medals of the formally dressed instructors shone, as did the slightly mismatched civil officer instructors'礼轄, the instructors' wives in紋章禮服, and the new graduates and the entire student body, all standing silently in rows.</p>
<p>His Imperial Highness the Envoy, on a naval vessel, arrived at the dock. Gunshots rang out, and the Japanese national anthem was played. His Highness, accompanied by Minister of the Navy Yonei,侍從武官, and others, entered the hall under the respectful greetings of all.</p>
<p>Soon, the bugle sounded "Attention," indicating that His Highness had taken his seat. It is best to leave the readers to imagine the circumstances of the solemn graduation ceremony that followed.</p>
<p>However, the 真人 only received a graduation certificate from the principal and did not receive a short sword bestowed by the侍武官. This was a fact. Although he was not a poor student, he was not an excellent student either. His only consolation was that he had obtained a second-dan license from the Kodokan before graduation.</p>
<p>After the graduation ceremony, His Highness returned to the ship. All the members saw him off until the shadow of the御召艦 disappeared. Following the order, the new graduates flew to the student hall like脱兎. New lieutenant junior grade uniforms were waiting for them there. Although not very wide, the full line of knots shimmered on the cuff. The微章 on the military cap shone with golden light.</p>
<p>The new candidates, who had changed their clothes, came out of the student hall one after another with shy smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>"Congratulations!"</p>
<p>Instructors, students, instructors' wives, and even children shouted, and even the thick-skinned people turned purple.</p>
<h3>Far East Bank Purchases Meningitis Vaccine</h3>

<h3>Shandong Compatriot Association Actively Promoting Association Affairs</h3>
<p>The Shandong Compatriot Association on Ximen Road, under the leadership of Su Chengde, Tan Dakai, Cui Shijie, Wu Weijun, etc., is developing rapidly, with 4,000 members. During the Spring Festival, the association donated ten thousand yuan each in surplus funds to the Shen and Xin newspapers for scholarships. The funds were delivered yesterday. The association is carefully considering repairing the Confucius Temple and has decided to contract it and sign a contract. Work will start soon. The association is currently discussing methods with the Shen Daily Social Service Department to announce that the Qilu School attached to the Confucius Temple has been reorganized by the board of directors and is developing more rapidly.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Yesterday, we received a donation of 5,000 yuan from Zhang Caiji, 200 yuan each from Yuan Liji, Du Shengxu, Yang Shutang, Yan Zhendian, and Li Renzhen, 100 yuan each from Ma Caiji, Zhao Guoji, Xin Jianying, and Shen Weilian, 500 yuan from Ruan Maode, 50 yuan from Wu Dezhang, 30 yuan from Chen Weijian, and 20 yuan from Feng Shuangfu, totaling 7,000 yuan.

<h3>Ziyou Association Fundraising Proceeding Smoothly</h3>

<h3>Aurora University New Collection of Rare Books</h3>
<p>- Luo Yimin</p>
<p>Recently, Aurora University received a donation of four large books from Mr. Liu Tizhi, all of which are rare books for studying Chinese literature and linguistics. They have been on display in the university's linguistics library since the other day for viewing. Mr. Liu is a prominent scholar of the time, with a family history of scholarship. His father, Bingzhang, was a great Confucian scholar during the Xianfeng years of the late Qing Dynasty, who served as the Governor-General of Sichuan for many years. After his death, he was given the posthumous title "Wenzhuang." The "Collected Memorials of Liu Wenzhuang" in eight volumes and "Jingxuan Notes" in four volumes, written by him, were published by Mr. Tizhi and are the first two of today's rare books. The other two, which are voluminous, were written by Tizhi himself and are precious books for studying Chinese bronze inscriptions. One is "Shan Qi Ji Jin Lu" in twenty-eight volumes, containing thousands of pictures and inscriptions of bronzes, all of which were owned by Mr. Liu in the past or are now. The other is "Xiao Xiao Jing Ge" in eighteen volumes, which consists of rubbings of genuine works of more than six thousand five hundred ancient bronze inscriptions, with modern copies, annotations by predecessors, and annotations by Mr. Liu himself. Modern Chinese linguists, all those who are concerned about the history of Chinese calligraphy and explain Chinese characters and inscriptions using scientific methods, must not take Mr. Liu's works lightly.</p>
<p>Regarding the explanation of ancient characters, Xu Shen wrote "Shuowen Jiezi," but judging from the various font styles listed in the book, it can be seen that his knowledge of ancient bronzes and inscriptions was limited. Since Australia, historical books have mentioned the discovery of ancient bronzes from time to time. By the Song Dynasty, collection began to expand, and the decision was made to request explanations for inscriptions. However, it was not until the late Qing Dynasty that significant progress was made. Many books on the collection of bronzes have been published, with rubbings of inscriptions and annotations. However, the rubbings are often handwritten copies rather than the originals. The increase in publications is due to the increasing number of bronze discoveries in various famous ruins, and this trend continues to this day. Among these publications, Mr. Liu's lifelong works can be regarded as the culmination of them all.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu is proficient in literary and historical classics, and is especially versed in 小学. He provides accurate explanations for several chapters of ancient inscriptions, revealing what predecessors had not. He is not only a master of Chinese literature and history, but his works also express the spirit of modern science: that is, any view, no matter how old its origin, if it conflicts with the various materials obtained through meticulous research and excavation in recent years, he resolutely abandons it without hesitation. In short, Mr. Liu is truly an heir to Eastern culture. Now, he has donated the above-mentioned four books to Aurora University, giving most people the opportunity to observe them, which is truly commendable.</p>
