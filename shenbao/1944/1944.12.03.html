<p>東京二日中央社電　日大本營二日午一時發表：日陸軍中隊中重男指揮之特別攻擊隊航空挺進隊，十一月二十六日夜以運糧機四架於雷伊泰島塔拉克，布羅音敵機塲附近敢行降落，據日軍偵察機偵察得知，其後該空挺隊決死突入敵二機塲之要地，似已收獲莫大戰果。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日本大本營二日發表：陸軍特別攻擊隊空挺隊，自空中之攻擊，實乃世界航空戰中空前之必殺地上攻擊，其壯烈之戰，實足以驚天地而泣鬼神。日軍空挺部隊勇士，於二十六日分乘運輸機四架，出擊於雷伊泰島敵軍機塲，着陸後，一同殺入敵陣，因全數示能歸還，戰果不明。據敵方廣播稱：日機兩架在塔拉克機塲附近强行着陸後，即襲擊機塲重要部，奮戰力鬥，敵陣覆滅前，陷於極度混亂。另一部在布羅音敵機塲附近着陸，似亦作同樣之壯烈奪戰，據二十七日上午二時許日偵察機報告，其猛烈之防空砲火亦形微弱，布羅音機塲一面燄焰火光，可見日軍勇士之衝殺該塲，已予極大打擊。又此次空挺隊中，台灣。朝鮮勇士多數參加。</p>
<p>菲律賓前線日軍某基地二日中央社電　日軍轟炸隊此次運送特別攻擊隊及空挺部隊基地降陸，偵功勞莫大，參加運送者，均爲歷在新幾內亞轟炸敵機塲，合敵軍胆戰心寒之勇士。據該隊長加島中佐談稱：運送空挺部隊安抵敵軍陣地，實非易事。此次於敵高射砲，機關砲等熾烈砲火之中，運送傘兵降落，真空前未有之半舉，駕駛員均爲歷經百戰之勇士，因恐途中遭遇敵機，有碍降陸，故特在夜間執行，吾人感覺運送活人炸彈，較從事轟炸更爲堅難。</p>
<p>海軍新銳機發揮威力</p>
<p>菲律賓方面前綫基地二日中央社電　菲律賓前綫連日繼續熾烈之航空決戰，日海軍新銳機「銀河」號及「慧星」號發揮其威力，參加偵察或轟炸，「銀河」號爲日海軍誇耀世界之最新銳機中之突擊機，當於台灣海面航空戰獲大戰果，常以單機夜襲敵機動部隊，炸沉敵航空母艦，白晝以大編隊向敵機動部隊挑戰，予以重大打擊，此新銳機有可驚之戰鬥力，雖具巨大機力，而速度極大，即敵方所誇耀之巨人人號戰鬥機，亦難泊及。S慕僚曾對此新銳機斷言謂，若有「銀河」號若干架，敵機動部隊絕難攻近菲律賓近海。與「銀河」號同時出現於菲律賓戰塲者爲「慧星」號新銳轟炸機，其俯衝轟炸爲敵所畏懼等，亦超過敵俯衝轟炸機S20號機，曾於雷伊泰灣內擊沉敵艦船，今者若大量製造「銀河」·「慧星」及零戰二號飛機，實足以殲滅美機動部隊，而大東亞戰爭亦必勝不敗，前綫海軍莫不恃比自信也。</p>

<p>南方前綫二日中央社電　摩羅泰島日軍，對物量雄厚之數十倍敵軍，連夜突擊，敵美進攻菲律賓之意越急，其犧牲亦隨之越大，故敵目下有避免出血之槪。茲錄該島日軍突擊詳情於後：（一）九月十五日晟，敵以空母戰艦爲中心約八十艘之機動部隊，在摩羅泰島南端之基拉舺東面二地區及該島東南北部分別登陸，在該島北部，東南及西南開始建機塲三處，遭日軍各小隊突入，以手溜彈及爆圖上筒等，破毀敵軍及機塲重要設施，敵建築侵攻菲律賓空軍基地之企圖，悉予粉碎。日高砂族「台灣人」等將士，由哈爾馬拉島出動，在摩羅泰島進行登陸成功，積極展開突擊。十月六日侵入姆舊及黑比間南端地帶高地之敵美指揮處，一舉將之毀破，該指揮處被迫退至哥地拉摩及比羅附近，敵登陸部隊至十月中旬死傷約五百，其他飛機兵器，通信設施，物資堆積所，被毀甚多，日軍戰死僅四名，高砂族勇士利用地形，潛伏於森林中，繼續奮鬥。（二）美軍登陸後，日軍敢死隊即時由哈爾馬黑拉島增援摩羅泰島，四週敵美艦艇重重警戒，敵機日夜偵察，但日軍敢死隊舟艇在此困難情形下，隱寗登陸成功，第批敢死隊乘小艇突入敵軍艦隊警戒綫，敵魚雷艇以六十里速力猛攻，遭日軍小艇之火箭擊毀，終獲登陸成功，靠岸後，舟艦數艘，目行擊沒。（三）敵軍登陸後，遭日軍突擊，死傷甚多，已無法補充。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地二日中央社電　日秀空部隊二十九日再度空襲摩羅泰島，敵機塲掩護地區五處中彈起火，三處爆炸，滑行路亦生火災，日機無事歸還。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　敵美頃以雷伊泰灣爲中心，力謀强化運輸接濟，然以在海空戰中，航空母艦羣迭蒙重創，不得再襲機動部隊實施正式作戰，於是遂動員其殘存之航空母艦，乘日軍攻擊之間隙，出而攻擊，因此運輸船之駛入灣內，均在極不安全之護衛下，而日神風特別攻擊隊之攻擊目標，亦即在擊滅此運輸船，蓋消滅敵運輸船，亦即所以削弱敵運輸戰之戰力也。如一日大本營所發表，日軍自二十六日至三十日間，在雷伊泰灣方面及帛琉東方海面收獲沉毀敵運輸城江之光，即將船五艘之戰果，由此以觀，日方戰至現在止，沉毀敵運輸船艘數，僅據日大本營發表，神風特攻隊已擊沉其八艘，擊毀其九艘，航空部隊已擊沉其五艘，擊毀其十艘，合計共擊沉其十三艘，擊毀其十九艘，若將菲律賓海戰日海軍之戰果合度，則已沉毀其運費輸船三十六艘以上，其中十七艘以上係被擊沉，十九艘係被擊毀。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　日軍於攻陷桂柳地區後，即續行追擊渝軍殘部，至十一月二十四日，已將廣西省內美空軍之最後根據地南寗佔領。同時另一部隊，亦於是日將貴州省南門黎明關攻陷，而衝入該省境內，刻正以破竹之勢，續行進攻中。又與此相呼應而於黔桂　路沿綫作戰中之新軍，於二十二日業已佔領金載江及河池，至二十八日更將南丹佔領，目前正急選中。此外日空軍亦與日陸軍並肩作戰，而於未佔領金城江之光，即將其西部之鐵路炸毀，切斷渝軍退路。據日大本營一日發表稱，日軍鹵獲戰貨火車四百二十輛，客車及汽車埯二十輛，及其他砲火槍　若干噸，是役之獲得如斯戰果，實因日空軍對鐵橋炸毀，截斷渝軍之退路所致也。自廣西通達貴州方面之道路，係經由黎明關及南丹之兩綫而成，此與黔桂鐵路同係貴州省內之三大動脈，今因軍之猛攻貴州，故此三動脈已遭控制，因之貴州省內之命脈已逐漸瀕於危殆矣。茲渝軍因黔省已告危急，爲積極拯救計，特將七十六軍之二師及七十九軍之二師，配置於省境一帶，將七十六軍第一百九十六師，及九十七軍之一部，配債於南宗附近，而據險要之山脈，頑强抵抗，爰自桂柳地區喪失後，將司令部移至貴州省境附近之河池，由白崇禧·張發奎·擔當防衛重責。同時參謀總長何應欽，亦由重慶飛來指揮，以防衛貴州省之作戰，然於日軍猛攻下，渝軍之防衛陣營已形崩潰，故何應欽等作戰指揮者，遂放棄其責任逃去。此次桂柳地區陷落，至二十八日日軍已自廣西進至貴州省。按黎明關至貴陽二百公里，貴陽至重慶二百五十公里，故日軍至重慶之距離，已形短縮矣。因此重慶方面在軍事上政治上所受之影響極大云。</p>
<p>貴州前綫一日中央社電　貴州日軍攻陷河池南之兩地，繼續向前推進，於二十日八時，突破省境據點六塞墟，突入省內，並於該日正午，佔領距省境二十公里之下司，刻仍在追殘敗渝軍，</p>

<h3 id="c10">論物價漲政策 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 景賢</p>
<p>當前次世界大戰時，物價問題是到了戰爭的後期纔顯著起來的，但這次大戰各國在戰爭的初期就感到物資缺乏，通貨膨脹，物價問題的嚴重了。這是什麼緣故呢？原來資本主義到了十九世紀的末葉及本世紀的開始，已由自由資本主義而進入獨占資本主義。此種獨占資本以巨大的生產力來生產商品，已無適當的市塲供其販賣，且以其本身機構之硬化—以價格爲中心之自由競爭的消滅，國民經濟各部門失却均衡時，陷入恐慌毛細管之自動恢復之不可能等等—一九二八年後，資本先進各國遂陷入長期的蕭條。爲打開此種局面，各國均先後推行所謂景氣政策，即由政府發行公債，出資大與土木工程及軍事工業，以救濟企業，並準備因經濟上的競爭而引起的戰爭危機，如美國「新政」運動等，一時聳動耳目。</p>
<p>但是上述經濟政策，原爲一種消費經濟，大量物資的脫離國民經濟之再生產過程，是以此種入爲的景氣達到某一程度時，通貨之增加逐漸與生產循環背道而馳，通貨膨脹之現象遂告觀著。由於此種國民經濟之內面的脆弱性，以至戰爭爆發後，物價即成嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>其次，由於生產力的時步與科學的發達，戰爭消耗的物資數量大增。從軍事技術上言之，火器之速射性及遠射性，航空戰的進步，軍隊的摩托化……等等，都使戰爭的消耗趨大，而造成物資的缺乏，促進物價問題之嚴重性。</p>
<p>要之，物價問題是通貨與物資之集中的表現，其解決之手段與其從物價現象單方面來進行，寗從通貨及物資雙方面來調節，是更有效的。單從各國戰時狹義的物價統制來說，大致指定某一時點，命令一切物資價格停止上漲，然後必須再進行適當調整，以成本計算來公定價格。但是此種會定價格制必須依下列各原則，方可收效：　公定價格製自空間言之，應及於全國各地，自時間言之，應指定一時瞇，同時加以決定；　其對象應及於生產財，消費財之一切物資；　並應自生產者至消費者之各階段，制定公定價格；　此外如工資，地租，運費等亦應加以統制。</p>
<p>近頃華中物價問題，越趨嚴重。我國社會繼濟落後，經濟組織散漫不堪。資本旣不發達，離獨占階段尙遠，先進各國之企業獨占體，如「卡推爾」等組織，戰爭期間均由政府賦與相當權力，爲自治統制團體，亦爲我國絕無僅有。即以在本計算一項而首，產業規模旣小，精確之數字旣爲不可能者。且華中之物價運動，除受純經濟之法則限制外，更須受經濟外之各種條件之影響，其複雜情形，殊難盡述。</p>
<p>上月廿二日申報揭載的夢騶氏之「抑平物價與管理物資」一文，對目前華中經濟所遭遇之最嚴重的物價問題，提出十分新穎的見解，想爲一般讀者感到很大的興趣。誠如編者在該文附言中所述，「物價問題已成政治，社會等問題，他足使政治腐敗，社會混亂，治安不靖，甚至人心奸詐，道德淪亡」，而且，他又是直接威脅個人生活的問題，其引起各方的注目也是必然的。</p>
<p>夢騶氏的原文大致可分爲二部份，首爲採取取物價漸漲政策，以抑平物價；其次爲勵行登記制度，以管理物資，取締囤積。而其意見之中心，仍在以物價之合理的漸漲，以代替維持不合理的低物價。而所謂勵行登記，取締囤積一項，則在指摘現行法規及機構之缺陷，以致狡黠者得垂機逃避，而守法者反無所從。且對登記後之辦法未有規定，致收效未宏，囤積依然等諸點。要之，其中心在該文前半，而後者不過是推行物價漸漲政策之技術上的條件而已。</p>
<p>現在我們一檢討商物價漸漲政策之內容，照作者的意思是「參酌當時的正常市價及市拆租率，並各種物資的保管費，目然消耗等，分別規定某種物資的基價，及每月漲價的百分率，容許其逐月漲價」，換句話說，就是使物價的上漲有一規律性，使其在某種程度逐步上漲。</p>
<p>戰時物價之上漲，本來是不可避免的。如上所述，龐大的戰費，擴大生產事業等支出，政府不得不創造通貨。而戰時經濟政策對通貨方面者，在減少其流通速度，對物資方面者，則在增加其流通速度，對物資方面者，則在增加其流通速度，獎勵儲蓄及取締囤積之目的就在此。所以夢騶氏之所謂「某種物資基價」及「每月漲價之百分率」之決定，保管費及自然消耗所佔成份自然甚小，主要是在所謂「正常市價」及「當時的市拆利率」。</p>
<p>「正常市價」是否用成本計算，這一點原文並無規定，我們暫不論。僅就市拆利率來檢討，什麼是市拆利率？就是市面上一般貨幣資本所生的利潤率，其本身就是所謂黑市，「大抵比照當時囤貨利益的多少以決定其高低者」。在我們的經濟組織中，各種資本的利潤雖有凹凸，大致是平均的。在上海拿錢借給人家，或做生意，其所得好處常常是差不多的，要是做生意獨好，有錢的人就不會拿錢放債或經營工廠了。各種物資的價格大致也是平均上漲的，但是其中也有特別暴漲得利害的。</p>
<p>現在從物價與市拆的關聯來考察，其漲落關係當然可有三種：</p>
<p>（一）兩者的漲落是一致的。</p>
<p>（二）某種價格上海較所謂基價十市拆爲速；</p>
<p>（三）與第二例適成顛倒，即某種價格上漲較所謂基價十市拆爲緩。</p>
<p>則夢騶氏的所謂物價漸漲政策僅能適用於第一例，而第二，第三例就不能適用了。那麼，請問某種物資的價格，其上漲的趨勢並不按市拆利率時應怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>其次物價並不是像夢騶氏想像那樣，是機械的，按一定比率上漲的。比如食油價格而言，本年二月間上海市價每斤九十五元左右，迄八月中旬止，不但不漲，有時且趨跌，若照漸漲政策辦法，商人反而避免自由經濟機構的供求法則之危險，倒是獎勵商人囤積了。</p>
<p>再者，實行漸漲政策的前提，據說是取締囤積，該氏並提出現行機構的缺陷，意見極佳。但是，取締囤積須以强大的的政治力爲前提，這一層目前似乎也不大容易。其實，今日之所謂市拆利率是由貨幣資本的利潤及通貨購買力下跌的損失部分構成的，和其他資本的利澗並不會相差多少，其本身原該受統制，抑平的。那麼，以其爲基準而計算的物價，結果與今日物價的自然上漲趨勢，大致不會相差多少的。結果如此，那麼所謂物價漸漲政策亦是一種放任政策罷了。</p>
<p>要之，物價政策該是綜合的，包括物資，通貨，勞動力，運輸等等，是多方面有關的，我們希望的也是這種綜合的對策。</p>

<p>本巿警察局司法處防犯委員會，爲宣傳防犯意義，幷籌募防犯經費，曾於上月在蘭心大戲院公演「回頭是岸」防犯話劇，該處爲將是劇公演經過，票款之收入，及經費之保管動用情形，使各界明瞭起見，特於昨（二日）下午四時假都城飯店招待新聞界茶會，詳加報吿，到有司法處長李時雨，副處長管賢二郎，防犯科長楊雄時，秘書張馮正，以及各報社記者數十人，由李處長報吿略謂：「我們知道陳市長到上海來，即以澄淸汚濁的上海，建設新的淸潔繁榮的大上海，實現廉潔政治爲已任，這是最崇高的政治理智想。換言之，就是要减少消滅社會上一切罪惡，使我國進而爲現代化的法治國家。爲了要達到這崇高的理想，防犯遝動更是當務之急。推進防犯工作的方法，經我們數月來研究，須藉誘導控制與補救三種相輔而行，其法容與性質，已經發表過數次，總之，我們是對於社會的病態，講求治療的方法，希望减少犯罪乃至消滅犯罪，也就是排除危害，增進福利，個人法益有以保障，社會秩序才能安寧，國家法律得以維護其尊敬，所以纔有防犯運動的推進，纔有這次上演防劇「回頭是岸」募集防犯基金的事情。</p>
<p>爲了工作便利起見，我們組織了防犯運動宣傳委員會去推動這件事。關於票價方法，雖嫌榮譽券價較高，但爲募集基金，非較高一點，則不敷原來計劃，惟是在勸銷票劵之前，決定了幾個原則，第一銷給正當士紳，第二不得有強制手段推銷，第三銷給明瞭我們募集防犯基金的意義而誠心贊助者。這次公演結果，共計票價收入一千八百七十五萬元，除演員酬金，塲費，佈景，道具，廣吿，事務等費開支外，凈餘一千四百餘萬元，其詳細賬目，將另刋於最近計劃出版之「回頭是岸」特輯中，關於這筆基金，我們組織防把基金保管委員會，除本處負責以外，還要聘請市政諮詢委員會委員參加，擬存放本巿著名銀行中，以每月利息充作防犯事業費及事務費，從此防犯工作之開展，可以得到了相當保障。</p>
<p>今後工作，除最近計劃舉行防犯運動宣傳週外，決先組織防犯宣傳委員會，防犯研究委員會，防犯編輯委員會，從事初步工作，並擬徵求防犯贊助委員，於各電臺設法律講座及發行專刋，一俟時機成熟，更進而組織市民防犯協會，務須防犯工作廣泛展開而獲得實際上之效果。」</p>

<p>在戰况白熱化的西南太平洋上，日本潛艇的奮戰，與航空部隊的活國相得益彰，達成了驚人的大勝利。自從十月三日在哈樂馬里拉東方海面擊沉擊毀敵方航空母艦各一艘以後，森永潛水艇長於十月廿四廿五兩日，又先後擊沉航空母艦各一艘，驅逐艦一艘，以及運輸船四隻以上。日本的潛水艇，正克肥種種困難，在太平洋上築起光榮的戰績金字塔。下面就是建立擊沉擊毀敵方航空母艦各一艘的潛艇戰記。</p>
<p>戒備森嚴</p>
<p>敵軍爲了掩護上陸，摩羅泰島的警戒，的確非常森嚴。當我們的潛艇正想駛入某水道時，突然有兩隻哨戒艇出現在前面。幸虧潛沒得快，未被發覺。潛水艦長椎塚三夫大尉決心強行進入水道，可是，要想突破嚴密戒備着的入口，到底是不可能的。因此，艦首轉向摩羅泰島東南的海面。從十月二日晚上起，海上括着強烈的焉南風，汹湧澎湃的怒濤，劇烈搖着艦體。我們的目標是敵方的機動部隊。這時候，操縱着潛艇，使它或沉或浮的勇士們，祇有一個念頭，就是擊沉敵方航空母艦。在黑暗中，守望員和驚濤駭浪奮鬥着，專心一意地努力本位工作。漫漫的長夜過去了，天際已泛微白。這是十月三日的拂曉。長時間潛航的命令一下，我們的艦影便悄然從摩羅泰東方洋上消失。六時廿分，聽音室突然有報告傳到司令塔來。據譧聽音員已聽到幅廣二十度的築團音。</p>
<p>各就配置</p>
<p>這樣好的野味豈讓它逃走？全艦的神經這時彷彿完全集中在聽音員的耳朵上。集團音愈來愈近。艦長於是自信滿意滿地發令道：「各就配置！」「準備魚雷戰！」發了隆隆的聲音來的敵艦，一定有好幾艘。艦長斷定它們正是我方所期待着的敵方機動部隊，屢次將潛望鏡露出海面，但總望不見艦影響。時間一秒一秒挪移過去，謹慎的艦長集中精神，小心地指揮潛艇接近目標。忽然，兩架落基特式飛機映現於潛望鏡中；它們的高度是一千米。呃哼，敵方的警戒可不疏忽哪！萬一被它們發兇，那末一番苦心都將化爲泡影了。於是小心翼翼地繼續作大的之字運動。但是判斷一有錯誤的話，千載難逢的良機便要失去了。</p>
<p>七時十七分，潛望鏡裏微微望見一些黑烟。</p>
<p>「戰鬥，魚雷戰！」</p>
<p>發射管室突然緊張起來，空氣鼓入了魚雷。</p>
<p>七時二十六分，艦長終於在艦首右方發見一支桅桿。聲音是早已聽到了，敵艦的影子卻直到這時才能看見。艦長說不出的欣喜，緊抓住潛鏡。海上依然風狂浪湧，好幾次幾幾乎將潛艇掀出海面。潛望鏡攬起的白波縱然不被敵方發見，如果潛艇本身却露了出來，那不更有危險嗎？久經訓練的將士們，盡力駕御着這艘駕馬似的潛艇，不讓它浮出海面。</p>
<p>未幾，在巡洋艦似的桅桿後面，接着又出現了不少桅桿。聽音員的耳中並聽到了好像是大艦的輪機聲。到了七時四十三分，終於清楚地窺見二隻驅逐艦。艦長決意迅速突破敵方輪型陳。按敵方的輪型陳，其航空母敵空軍之艦羣密集於中央聞，而其外廓則相當廣大。所以這時尙望不見航空母艦。偷過了右側護衛的驅逐艦，終於雖見三艘航空母艦。相隔距離約一千五百米左右，前面兩隻，後面一隻。哈哈，正是夢中所見的美國航空母艦羣！這時，敵艦正在繼續作大角度的之字運動。</p>
<p>一擊命中</p>
<p>最近的那隻航空母艦，在飛行甲板的後部，整劉地排列着許多飛機。艦長一想到那批飛機正是攻擊羅泰島上日軍陸上部隊的家伙時，越加把心一橫，務必給以必殺的一擊。但是，第一隻航空母艦，由於改變針路的緣故，竟讓它逃過了射點。因此，艦長的限凝視着後面的兩隻航空母艦，下令「露頂」。可是，潛艇水平舵手雖然拚命努力，潛艇却因波濤汹湧的緣故，不易如意地浮揚起來。在這當兒，艦長咬緊牙齒，無可奈何。後來，總算僅僅露出桅桿的尖端，慢慢露出潛艇司令塔頂。時間剛巧是八時零二分。廠方兩艘航空母艦的後部飛行甲板上，列置飛機多架，有二三十架遮蔽着邊緣。魚雷是向航空母艦射出去了。艦長感到有些空虛，因爲露頂緩慢，發射稍遲，命中的希望極少。可是，神靈佑我，經過〇分〇秒，我們在水中聽到了轟隆隆的巨聲。命中啦！艦長因爲不希望射出的魚雷會得命中，甚至以爲是深水炸彈的炸裂聲。可是，以後又傳來了三聲命中的聲音。我們的四顆魚雷已擊中敵方航空母艦的巨體了。</p>
<p>不久，敵驅逐艦駛近我們。深水炸彈開始在我們頭上震盪。這時，火藥爆炸似的間響，連續不絕。入時五十二分，巨大的爆發間彷彿將海也攪翻身了，我們雖蜇伏海底，却也瞭然明白敵方的航空母艦已有一艘是擊沉了。敵艦投下的深水炸彈，一分鐘達十個左右，而飛機的炸彈更多，彷佛百數十顆同時擲下一般。隆隆之聲，不絕於耳，有時潛艇也被震得大搖特搖，宛若鐵鎚打着頭。他們是想　復吧。</p>
<p>這樣，我們在白晝堂堂襲擊敵方航空母艦羣，於不官戰鬥的怒濤中，建立了敵方航空母艦擊沈一艘擊毀一敵空軍之敵空軍之艘的殊動。（平手報道班員）（譯自十一月八日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 徐明</p>
<p>敏—一個十歲的孩子。</p>
<p>他聽媽說爸要回來了，他很高興，他知道爸爸會帶好吃的東西和好頑的玩具給他，真快活極了，馬上把這個消息告訴他的小朋友們，意思好像：「我爸回來了。你們還敢欺侮我？你們該欽偑我，做我的作虜。」</p>
<p>一聽到汽笛聲響，敏呆想着：「今天爸一定可回來了，媽說：「爸是昨天在X埠動身，今晨由X乘輪船到家。」也許現在已下了輪船……到了街頭……門口。」</p>
<p>「確……」，有人在敲門。</p>
<p>「爸回來了，」敏一面在呌着，一面却連砲帶跳去開門，每當他看見不是他爸時，一片沸騰着的熱誠大失所望的沒興而返。</p>
<p>有時他還偷偷地獨個兒跑到碼頭，在人叢中東竄西竄，直待旅客散完後，並沒他爸的形踪，他又失望了。</p>
<p>「或許我剛才跑到東邊去的時候，爸却從西邊回去了。」他又疑惑地想着。他很懊悔，不該亂跑，於是他那已冷的心又開始燃燒起來，他帶着一綫之光很快地跳到家中，然而事實並不如他的想像。</p>
<p>這樣的事，竟發生了好幾次，實在使他一顆小心太掃興，太灰心了，因而當他爸回來的一天，並沒有那樣的做，他很漸愧，也很悲傷，慚愧他沒有堅持的心，悲傷他的前功盡棄。</p>
<p>他爸這次回來是帶他媽到X埠去看病的，敏想當然也是一起去了。乘汽車，坐輪船，到外地去，是多麼一件與奮的事，尤其在敏的心理上。他把這個消息又同樣地告訴他的小朋友們。</p>
<p>「媽，是不是帶我去？」敏還有點不放心地問着。</p>
<p>「去的日期還早呢！你好好地去上學，走的一天，一定會告訴你，讓你和你的小朋友去道別。」他媽含糊的答應他。</p>
<p>一天早晨，每剛醒來看見媽在整理衣箱，就很快的起了身。</p>
<p>「媽，今天我們動身了？我那一套新做的學生裝可不要忘掉放在箱子裏。」敏更加上一句說：「今天我可以不去上學了。」</p>
<p>「不，今天沒有輪船，明天才能動身！今天是你最後在家的一天，敏，你還要去上學，好學生是有一天的時間就該讀一天書。」</p>
<p>敏今天本不願去上學，恐怕媽會騙他，但爲了要和他的小朋友們臨別的一唔，也就欣然拿了書包上學去了。</p>
<p>他那裏會有心去聽先生所教的課文，他只掛念着他的爸媽，今天會不會走？同時他也希望快點兒散課，好回去看個究竟。</p>
<p>他進了門，就知道情形不妙，靜悄悄的沒有爸媽的人影兒，他問他婆婆，只說是出去買東西了，馬上就得回來，敏那裏背相信，縱然婆婆在阻止他，呌他，可總按不住憤恨的情緒，一口氣跑了出去</p>
<p>到了碼頭，看見爸媽還沒有上船。</p>
<p>「爸，我也來了，」他喜悅地跳躍着說。</p>
<p>爸沒有回答，顯得不高興的樣子，最後還是他媽安慰地說：</p>
<p>「這兒一包點心，你帶回去一個人吃！我沒幾天就要回來，你在家要聽婆婆的話，好好兒用功讀書，將來你要甚麼？寫信來我一定會買給你，放乖點，媽是去看病的。」</p>
<p>敏的了這一翻話，不禁眼淚奪眶而出，他很不想走開，可是當他偷眼看着他爸的嚴厲的面孔，一聲也不敢響，只用衣袖抹凈了淚珠，拿了那一包點心，無精打采的一步一步踱了回來。</p>
<p>敏仍舊照常去上學，好像沒有以前那樣天真活潑。</p>
<p>「小敏，你怎麼不同你媽到X埠去？」小朋友們常和他打趣地說：</p>
<p>他臉上泛着一陣陣的紅暈，一種慘凉的氣氛，使他默默地沒有一語。</p>
<p>敏的媽去了一星期……一個月……兩個月總不見回來，起初敏還感到脫離了母愛而寂寞，但爲時旣久，也就漸漸地疏忽了</p>
<p>他的性情變了冷靜，并沒有腦也變了呆滯，每逢城裏迎神賽會，他的足跡很少踏過，他祇獨生坐在家中，有與時看些書本，煩惱時躺在牀上想從夢中尋些快樂。</p>
<p>本來，小孩子離開了母親，是一件最痛心的事，媽像一個人失去了溫暖的外衣，遊浪在街頭，悽慘，冷落……</p>
<h3 id="c27">一紙文憑的代價 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 藍平</p>
<p>……三年，悠久的高中的歲月喲！</p>
<p>翻開了照相簿，偶然見到五年前的一張相片，那是我剛進高中的時候拍的。圓胖的臉兒，活潑的姿勢，現在都到那兒去了？</p>
<p>三年的高中歲月，把我變成了另外一個人，它奪去了我肥胖的雙頰，活潑的性情；把我變做一個冷清清的愛孤獨的人了。</p>
<p>……在故鄉念過了初中一，到上海來便雄心得到勝劉似地，我學得無上的榮耀自負。但是，同時我發現擋在面前的有一座很高很高的山——我國文英文程度雖然勉強可以跟上同級的學生，但是數學和理化，簡直是我從前絕未接觸過的。沒讀過代數的人，呌他一下子跳到三角和和幾何，是多繁重困苦的工作！爬！我拼命向上爬，用出了全身每根筋肉的力量向上爬。光榮呀！我幼小的身體居然能爬過那樣高的山，克服以了那重重困難，但是，天！我那肥潤圓胖的臉兒呢？</p>
<p>……一盞孤零零的燈光下，整個頭腦埋在一堆堆的書本裏。忘了桌上的時鐘，忘了悽寒的冬夜。爸媽早已起了鼾聲，弟弟妹妹在做他們美麗的夢。我在整理學校的功課外，還要從頭把沒讀過的初中的書目已一一來學習。沒有人教，也沒有人邦助，一切都由我自己的腦筋去打開我的路來。每夜至少到鐘聲敲了十二下才疲倦地站起身子，看著窗外漆黑的夜，聽一聽地上一點兒人聲也沒有，心中感到一陣辛酸。</p>
<p>……第一次月考數學拿到地三十二分，我的天！一顆子彈射進了我的心胸，這是我進學校以來第一次不及格的分數。我覺得先生對我冷冷地鄙視；同學在譏笑，全宇宙都拿輕蔑的眼光看着我。晚上在慘淡的燈光下，抱着考卷不知流下多少眼淚。我是考過頭名得過獎狀的喲！</p>
<p>「讓他去吧！最多不過留級的。」心底下不時會發出這樣的聲音。但是理智立刻喚醒了我。</p>
<p>「不，決不能這樣的。平！你有的是腦筋，是青年的魄力，用力吧！爬到那山上去吧！」</p>
<p>……望着一疊疊的書本，有時會流出眼淚，但是這眼淚是向裏流的。我變做了個孤獨的人，放學回來便一個子躱在房裏，翻着一頁頁印滿着字的書，做着繁重的習題。吃飯了放下了書，腦海依舊留著Sine－Cosin的影子，吃過了飯，又回到書本裏去。爸媽和弟妹們在說故事，看畫報聽無綫電，我是沒有份的。不是我不要參加，我那來的時間呢？有時看他們玩得太高興了，也跑過來聽兩下，一個念頭很快地把我又拉回了自已的房間，我的功課還沒做完呢！書本把我和社會隔絕了，三年的時間，我完全像住在和世人隔離的修道院裏，不懂得人情，不懂得世事，只曉得書！一堆堆厚厚的書，不知道什麼呌合羣，什麼呌青春的活力。紅潤的雙頰漸漸消失了，活潑好動的性情完全改變了，簡直不像一個朝氣勃勃的青年，像在人們脚下低訴滄桑的秋草，像沒陽光的早晨！</p>
<p>……爸媽帶着嘻嘻哈哈的弟妹，去看電影，吃西菜，當然呌我也去，我又何嘗不歡喜去呢？但是想到明兒先生還得要問功課，咬着牙搖了搖頭說不去。媽憐惜地望着說：</p>
<p>「一同去吧！沒關係的，又不在乎這一點功課。」</p>
<p>但是我總不敢去，就是去了也沒心想玩的。</p>
<p>「那末好吧，我給你帶點好吃的回來。」</p>
<p>我望着她們快活的背影走出了門口，眼淚快了眼眶上。</p>
<p>雖然我第二次月考便使人驚異地跳到八十幾分，但，我是付過代價的喲！</p>
<p>……一個沒月亮的深夜，我做着一個題目，做來做去總做不出，急得快想把題目撕掉。媽起來了，瞥見我房裏有電燈光，慢慢地開了進來，看見我還在書桌邊沒有睡，她感動地非常慈憫的撫了撫我的肩膀：</p>
<p>「平兒，你快去睡吧！這樣晚了，爸媽知道你用功的，當心別弄壞了身體。」</p>
<p>我喉嚨梗住了說不出話，強力地忍住了眼淚，讓她把我拉到了床上。她看我臥了下去，又細心地替我理了肩旁的被，關了電燈，輕輕地走出去。</p>
<p>「你快好好的睡吧！」她又控進頭來說一聲……</p>
<p>……三年的光陰像火車的輪子，在我身上緩緩地輾過。畢業了，我榮耀地列在在四十二個人的頭一名。同學投向我羨慕景仰的眼光，先生把我來做勉勵同學的榜樣。親友在互相的稱讚着我，爸買了一支鋼筆送我，媽爲我特買了一隻蹄膀……</p>
<p>我捧着文憑，望着窗外瀉進慘白的月光。那一千多日的悠久光陰，在那裏面也不知強忍過多少眼淚，在那裏面，我被變了一個人了。望着兩隻細瘦的手，再望着手上的文憑。在月光裏，文憑給眼淚滴濕了兩點……</p>

<h3 id="c31">申報杯籃球聯賽甲組　華聯中北明晚決門　兩雄相遇必有絕妙表演 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽，甲組行將全部完程，僅餘明日華聯中北之決鬥一塲而已。此次本報舉辦籃球聯賽，旨在提倡體育，而所得劵資，充助學金，亦一舉兩得之美事。迺承各球隊之踴躍參加，及每塲之恪守比賽，殊是可喜，又蒙籃球聯合會與裁判會予以協助，更爲感謝。而球迷之熱忱到塲，使球賽增加精神，最足表示謝忱焉。茲附甲組名次及戰績表於後。致乙組六部，均在最後之過程。</p>
<p>甲組名位如此定局</p>
<p>華聯入戰入勝榮居首席，明日對中北，如能一鼓而擒，則非但獲得錦標，抑且保持常勝榮衛。如不幸敗於中北，則與中北積分相等，勢將再舉行決奪。中北隊現七勝一負，暫列第二。戰華聯而能　，前途希望仍濃。反之，將與汕隊華南並列第二。大華隊頗以球運惡劣，及隊員時有缺席，屈居第五位，仁餘明星各以三勝六頁列第六。華影同仁經過一番努力，表演精神殊佳，乃以二勝七負合居第八名。V隊屢戰屢北，忝列末座焉。</p>
<p>門票增加嘉惠學子</p>
<p>本報舉辦此聯賽之本旨，早爲各界所明悉。本文亦申述，非爲營利目的，極爲明顯，而此次決賽巳經決定酌予增價，樓上爲三百元，樓下爲五百元。共理由果爲希望稍示限制，易於維持秩序，亦所以增加助學金之實惠，造福於淸寒學子，想各界俱能鑒及也。</p>
<p>在此，筆者對於明日大戰之前，略作評述二强實力，並蕳叙預測：</p>
<p>華聯藥廠成功之隊</p>
<p>華聯爲華聯調廠同人所組織，有該廠總經理張溎祥領導兼指導，張君對球事旣心，對籃球戰術，亦且經騐。自組織華聯隊後，用合理之訓練，因此竿頭日進，戰績彪炳·出師之還，幾攻無不摧，聲震滬培，全隊實力，隊員體力極充沛，人材平均。故能以充分調換，實勝於他隊。而每隊員均有射籃本領，更爲可貴。致其戰術之特長處，唯爲能隨機應變，攻人之短，不媿爲一成功之隊。</p>
<p>中華表演北派特色</p>
<p>中北隊之隊員，類皆老將，且有國手，故極受球迷欽頌。指導爲戴昌齡，在籃球界固盛名久享，有其指揮，自得其所，隊長在仲陶曩年留學東京時，其籃球技術，受盡東京人士之推崇，乃相得益彰。此次中北其最露出弱一點者，厥爲氣力不逮。據謂以隊員多職務上之屬身一，練習機會較少所致，而其美麗之動作，及敏捷之出手，猶能發揮北派特巴一，此爲球迷一致之讚詞。</p>
<p>簡叙預測略加貢獻</p>
<p>興論所至及觀察近情，華聯勝利希望較厚。蓋一以心理佔優，二爲長力充沛，三則爲合作純熟，投籃凖確。中北而言，果未使無取勝機會，當須視乎令戰隊員之長力若何，最爲有關。如有始終保持前十分鐘之氣力而作戰到底，則我不敢言其必敗，進一步言，勝利亦轉爲有把握也。</p>
<p>華聯</p>
<p>今戰大致必先試鋒吳成章張顯崙勃脫，衛瞿錫麟孔廣益·事實上此陣綫較爲理想。唯對手中北多長人，則以顯崙少竄進，而用　起過頂　籃一項，似難秦效，頗以爲如必須時大可試用全長春之短小活潑，賴以竄進，致范慶公亦以射著，且亦具北派之長。今戰當可乘時試騐，如吾能以毒攻毒。然則重用，否則退休。再今日吳成峯必將受陳學崇之死釘，華聯對於籃下獲球一點，亟應加以相當覓得機得之策，尤其在自已籃下之球，免遭對方跟進。畢聯今須例外注意者，余以爲上述幾點而已。致戰術之如何，自有張淮祥齡又陵兩君之指導，各隊員之發揮，豈須筆者多談。</p>
<p>中北</p>
<p>正式陳容及處戰策略，最近似俱無一中心目的，乃不妨一談。鄙意可先須利用淸一色人長作戰，應爲鋒陳學祟李震中沈韋恭，衛趙雅林李賓中，於是在此機會中，試用高處傳遞，或可收效。更可於籃下球截刧之便利，不識以爲然吾？唯李震中似應爲後衛，蓋有帶球出來，及作進攻之傳遞球，則可與趙雅林對調位置，亦無不可。致作戰方術，決不能呆用聯防術，亦決不能用絕對人釘人制。簡言之，即兩法並行，亦可謂區城人釘人制，一俟立定地位後，則對方在本人區域內，應立即逼近使其脫手，擾亂其穩紮穩打施用戰術之機會，庶可得矣。又對於獲球權及籃下跟進兩項，應加以分外重視也</p>
<p>總之，此戰之精彩，必可有空前傑作，甚希雙方在爭取勝利，發揮球藝外，更儘量發揚運動精神值德，使申報盃聯賽留下一頁值得紀念之球賽，皆大歡喜，功德無量矣。</p>

<p>申報杯籃球聯賽田組　標，華聯中北將於明夜決賽，華聯而勝，冠軍決定，中北而勝，將再重決。以兩隊球藝之精湛，此役將爲本季最精彩之比賽，乃意料中事，但或以　方奪標心切，加以觀衆從旁刺激，不免使精彩爲之減少，本人爲忠實球迷之一，本爲愛戴兩方球隊者，爰列舉希望數則於次，庶幾此本季空前盛會，得臻於賀滿。</p>
<p>（一）最近球房觀衆，對於秩序，不甚注衆，妄目呌喊，不知此種行動，對於球員，更其緊張之比賽中，刺激甚大，每易於越軌犯規。明晚之比賽，必甚緊張，希望觀衆，靜觀球藝，勿予球員以無謂之刺激，使比賽進行順利。</p>
<p>（二）雙方球員常然奪標心切，但希望確遵守運動道德，表顯運動員神，將籃球之高美妙技術，充份發揮，勝固可賀，敗亦不辱。</p>
<p>（三）兩隊之主持人在仲陶張溎祥戴昌齡三君皆爲上海籃球會之最高負責當局，對球員之行動，當更有充分之訓練。故此賽之進行順利，本不生問題，設頭有若干越軌之處，站在籃球會及球隊當局之立塲，自應加以注意。</p>
<p>（四）裁判員爲比賽之主持人，掌握最高權威：故是賽之裁判，應果敢決斷，裁判明晰，亦可使比賽增其美滿也。（陸震英）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Paratroopers Bravely Fought and Landed on Leyte Island, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Enemy Airfields <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM on the 2nd: The special attack force of the Army, an air-landing unit led by Commander Nakashige, daringly landed four transport planes near the Taralak and Burauen enemy airfields on Leyte Island on the night of November 26th. According to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, the paratroopers then resolutely stormed key areas of the two enemy airfields, and appear to have achieved significant battle results.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 2nd: The air attacks by the Army's special attack paratroopers are an unprecedented ground attack in the history of aerial warfare, truly a "sure kill." Their heroic battle is truly earth-shattering and awe-inspiring. On the 26th, valiant Japanese paratroopers, aboard four transport planes, attacked enemy airfields on Leyte Island. After landing, they charged into the enemy lines together. Because none were able to return, the results of the battle are unclear. According to enemy broadcasts, after two Japanese aircraft forcibly landed near Taralak airfield, they attacked important parts of the airfield, fighting fiercely. The enemy camp was thrown into extreme chaos before being destroyed. Another unit landed near the Burauen enemy airfield and seemed to have launched a similarly heroic and fierce battle. A Japanese reconnaissance plane reported at around 2:00 AM on the 27th that the intense anti-aircraft fire was weakening, and the Burauen airfield was ablaze, indicating that the Japanese soldiers' assault on the airfield had inflicted heavy damage. Furthermore, many Taiwanese and Korean warriors participated in this paratrooper operation.</p>
<p>From a certain Japanese military base on the Philippine Front, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese bomber crews who transported the special attack forces and paratroopers to the landing base performed a great service. Those who participated in the transport were brave warriors who had previously bombed enemy airfields in New Guinea, instilling fear in the enemy. According to Captain Kashima, the unit commander, it was not easy to transport the paratroopers safely to enemy territory. This time, transporting paratroopers to land amidst fierce fire from enemy anti-aircraft guns and machine guns was an unprecedented feat. The pilots were all battle-hardened warriors. Fearing encountering enemy aircraft en route, which would hinder the landing, the operation was carried out at night. We felt that transporting "human bombs" was more difficult than conducting bombing runs.</p>
<p>Naval New Aircraft Display Power</p>
<p>From a forward base in the Philippines, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - Fierce aerial battles continue daily on the Philippine front. The Japanese Navy's new "Galaxy" and "Comet" aircraft are demonstrating their power, participating in reconnaissance and bombing missions. The "Galaxy" is the latest, world-renowned assault aircraft of the Japanese Navy. It achieved great results in the air battle over the Taiwan Strait, often launching single-plane night attacks on enemy mobile units, sinking enemy aircraft carriers. During the day, large formations challenged enemy mobile units, inflicting significant damage. This new aircraft possesses astonishing combat power. Despite its large size, it has great speed, making it difficult for even the enemy's vaunted "Giant" fighter plane to catch up. A staff officer asserted that if there were several "Galaxy" aircraft, enemy mobile units would never be able to approach the waters near the Philippines. Appearing on the Philippine battlefield at the same time as the "Galaxy" is the "Comet," a new dive bomber. Its dive bombing is feared by the enemy and surpasses the enemy's SBD Dauntless dive bomber. It has sunk enemy ships in Leyte Gulf. If the "Galaxy," "Comet," and Zero Fighter Type 2 aircraft are mass-produced, they will be sufficient to destroy the American mobile units, and the Greater East Asia War will certainly be won. The Navy on the front lines is extremely confident in this.</p>

<p>Leyte Island, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The enemy, with overwhelming material superiority, has now reached the vicinity of Carigara, Haro, Tagami, Abuyog, and Tacloban. One part of their forces is planning to advance from Abuyog towards Bapa. Furthermore, the enemy forces in Haro have been fiercely bombarding Ormoc from a distance of 20 kilometers with several 20 cm guns for several days. Although the Tacloban, Mother Burauen, and Southern Burauen airfields have been heavily bombed by the Japanese Air Force for days, they still hold 200-300 large, medium, and small-sized fighter-bombers. Japanese powerful forces have bravely landed under naval and air cover and are currently planning to break up the enemy's strategy. The enemy's landing force includes the 1st Division (mechanized unit), the 24th Division, the 96th Division, and the 7th Division, totaling seven divisions, and approximately 300 tanks. Japanese effective attacks by October 25th have been confirmed to have killed or wounded over 3,000 enemy soldiers, destroyed approximately 50 vehicles, destroyed 150 landing craft, destroyed over 20 enemy aircraft, and shot down over 20 enemy aircraft. Furthermore, one Japanese field artillery battery sank over 110 enemy ships in Leyte Bay. Japanese reinforcement units are continuing to land, and ammunition and rations have been piled up like mountains, urgently calling for reinforcements to cooperate. The Japanese forces on Leyte Island are now actively preparing for a general offensive, and a fierce battle to destroy the enemy will soon unfold.</p>
<p>Air Battle Shoots Down</p>
<p>Nine Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - On the afternoon of the 30th, the Japanese fighter squadron engaged approximately 20 enemy P-47 and P-40 fighters near Cebu Island in a fierce aerial battle, during which five of them were shot down by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - On November 30th, Japanese fighters encountered thirteen enemy P-38 aircraft over the sea east of Iloilo, resulting in a heroic aerial battle. Four of the enemy aircraft were shot down, with no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Assault Troops, Situation in Morotai, Air Force Cooperates to Strongly Attack Enemy Base <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Southern Front, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese forces on Morotai Island are conducting night raids against enemy forces that are dozens of times larger in terms of material. The enemy's intention to advance on the Philippines is becoming increasingly urgent, and their sacrifices are increasing accordingly. Therefore, the enemy currently has a concept of avoiding bloodshed. The details of the Japanese forces' raids on the island are recorded below: (1) On the 15th of September, the enemy, with a mobile unit of approximately 80 ships centered around aircraft carriers and battleships, landed in two areas east of Kilagapa on the southern tip of Morotai Island, as well as in the eastern, northern, and southern parts of the island. They began constructing three airfields in the northern, southeastern, and southwestern parts of the island. Japanese squads raided these locations, using hand grenades and explosive charges to destroy important enemy and airfield facilities, thwarting the enemy's attempt to build an air base for invading the Philippines. Japanese Takasago tribesmen [Taiwanese] and other soldiers, dispatched from Halmahera Island, successfully landed on Morotai Island and actively launched raids. On October 6th, they destroyed the enemy-American command post that had infiltrated the highlands in the southern area between Muju and Kobi, forcing the command post to retreat to the vicinity of Gotilamo and Biro. By mid-October, the enemy's landing force had suffered approximately 500 casualties. Many other aircraft, weapons, communication facilities, and material storage sites were destroyed. Only four Japanese soldiers were killed. The Takasago tribesmen, utilizing the terrain, lay hidden in the forests and continued to fight. (2) After the American forces landed, Japanese suicide squads immediately reinforced Morotai Island from Halmahera Island. Enemy-American warships heavily guarded the surrounding waters, and enemy aircraft conducted reconnaissance day and night. However, under these difficult conditions, the Japanese suicide squad boats stealthily succeeded in landing. The first batch of suicide squads broke through the enemy fleet's security line in small boats. Enemy torpedo boats attacked fiercely at a speed of 60 miles per hour, but were destroyed by the Japanese small boats' rockets, eventually achieving a successful landing. After reaching the shore, several enemy ships were destroyed. (3) After the enemy forces landed, they suffered many casualties due to Japanese raids and were unable to replenish their losses.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese "Hide" Air Unit once again raided Morotai Island on the 29th. Five enemy airfield protection areas were hit and caught fire, and three exploded. A fire also broke out on the runway. Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Over Thirty-Six Enemy Ships Sunk or Damaged in the Philippine Seas <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The enemy Americans have recently been focusing on strengthening transportation and supply lines centering on Leyte Gulf. However, because the aircraft carrier groups have suffered repeated heavy damage in the naval and air battles, they are no longer able to launch full-scale operations with mobile units. Therefore, they are mobilizing their remaining aircraft carriers to attack during gaps in the Japanese attacks. As a result, transport ships entering the bay are doing so under extremely insecure protection. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force's objective is to destroy these transport ships, because eliminating enemy transport ships also weakens the enemy's transportation war effort. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 1st, between the 26th and 30th of the month, Japanese forces in the Leyte Gulf area and the waters east of Palau sank five enemy transport ships, achieving a victory of destruction. From this perspective, up to the present, the number of enemy transport ships sunk or destroyed by the Japanese, according to the Imperial Headquarters, is as follows: The Kamikaze Special Attack Force has sunk eight and damaged nine. The air force has sunk five and damaged ten. In total, they have sunk thirteen and damaged nineteen. Combining this with the naval victories in the Philippine Sea battle, the total number of transport ships sunk or damaged is over thirty-six, of which over seventeen were sunk and nineteen were damaged.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - After capturing the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the Japanese army continued to pursue the remnants of the Chongqing army. By November 24th, they had captured Nanning, the last US Air Force base in Guangxi Province. At the same time, another unit captured Liming Pass in southern Guizhou Province on the same day and entered the province, and is currently continuing to advance with irresistible force. In conjunction with this, the new army fighting along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway line occupied Jinchengjiang and Hechi on the 22nd. On the 28th, they further occupied Nandan and are currently rapidly advancing. In addition, the Japanese Air Force is also fighting alongside the Japanese Army and, before occupying Jinchengjiang, bombed the railway to the west, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. According to an announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 1st, the Japanese army captured 420 trains, over 20 passenger cars and automobiles, and several tons of artillery, firearms, and ammunition. The achievement of such battle results was due to the Japanese Air Force bombing the railway bridges and cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. The roads from Guangxi to Guizhou Province consist of the Liming Pass and Nandan lines. These, along with the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, are the three main arteries of Guizhou Province. Now, due to the Japanese army's fierce attack on Guizhou, these three arteries have been controlled, and as a result, the lifeline of Guizhou Province is gradually approaching a crisis. The Chongqing army, realizing that Guizhou Province is in a critical situation, in an effort to actively save it, has deployed two divisions of the 76th Army and two divisions of the 79th Army in the provincial border area, and has deployed the 196th Division of the 76th Army and a part of the 97th Army near Nanzong, relying on the strategic mountain ranges to resist stubbornly. After the loss of the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the headquarters was moved to Hechi, near the border of Guizhou Province, with Bai Chongxi and Zhang Fakui shouldering the heavy responsibility of defense. At the same time, Chief of the General Staff He Yingqin also flew from Chongqing to direct the defense of Guizhou Province. However, under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army's defense lines have collapsed, and He Yingqin and other commanders have abandoned their responsibilities and fled. Due to the fall of the Guilin-Liuzhou area, by the 28th the Japanese army had advanced from Guangxi into Guizhou Province. Liming Pass is 200 kilometers from Guiyang, and Guiyang is 250 kilometers from Chongqing, so the distance between the Japanese army and Chongqing has been shortened. Therefore, the impact on Chongqing is extremely large in terms of military and politics.</p>
<p>Guizhou Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese army in Guizhou captured two locations south of Hechi and continued to advance, breaking through the strategic point of Liusai Market Town on the provincial border at 8:00 AM on the 20th and entering the province. At noon on the same day, they occupied Xiasi, 20 kilometers from the provincial border, and are still pursuing the defeated Chongqing army.</p>

<h3 id="e10">On the Policy of Rising Prices <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxian</p>
<p>During the last World War, the issue of commodity prices only became prominent in the later stages of the war. However, in this war, countries felt the shortage of supplies, currency inflation, and the seriousness of the commodity price problem from the very beginning. What is the reason for this? Originally, capitalism, by the end of the 19th century and the beginning of this century, had transitioned from free capitalism to monopoly capitalism. This kind of monopoly capital produced goods with huge productivity, but there was no suitable market for them to be sold. Furthermore, due to the rigidity of its own structure—the elimination of free competition centered on prices, the impossibility of automatic recovery of capillary tubes when the various sectors of the national economy lose equilibrium, etc.—after 1928, advanced capitalist countries fell into a prolonged period of depression. In order to break this situation, countries successively implemented so-called stimulus policies, that is, the government issued public bonds and invested heavily in civil engineering and military industries to rescue enterprises and prepare for the war crisis caused by economic competition, such as the "New Deal" movement in the United States, which caused a sensation for a time.</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned economic policies were originally a kind of consumption economy, and a large amount of materials were detached from the reproduction process of the national economy. Therefore, when this kind of artificial boom reached a certain level, the increase in currency gradually ran counter to the production cycle, and the phenomenon of currency inflation became apparent. Due to the internal fragility of this national economy, commodity prices became a serious problem after the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the progress of productivity and the development of science, the amount of materials consumed in the war has greatly increased. From a military technical point of view, the rapid-fire and long-range nature of firearms, the progress of aerial warfare, the motorization of the army...etc., have all increased the consumption of the war, resulting in a shortage of materials and promoting the seriousness of the commodity price problem.</p>
<p>In short, the commodity price problem is a concentrated manifestation of currency and materials. The means to solve it should be to regulate both currency and materials, rather than simply dealing with the commodity price phenomenon from one aspect, which is more effective. Generally speaking, from the narrow wartime price control of various countries, a certain point in time is generally designated, and all commodity prices are ordered to stop rising, and then appropriate adjustments must be made, and prices are officially set based on cost calculations. However, this kind of official pricing system must be based on the following principles to be effective: From a spatial point of view, the official pricing system should cover all parts of the country, and from a temporal point of view, a certain moment should be designated and decided at the same time; its object should cover all materials, including production goods and consumer goods; and official prices should be formulated at all stages from producers to consumers; in addition, wages, land rents, transportation costs, etc. should also be controlled.</p>
<p>Recently, the commodity price problem in Central China has become increasingly serious. My country's society is backward in relief, and the economic organization is extremely disorganized. Capital is not developed, and it is still far from the monopoly stage. Enterprise monopoly organizations in advanced countries, such as "cartels," etc., were given considerable power by the government during the war and became autonomous control groups, which is unique in our country. Even if we start with the item of costing, the scale of the industry is small, and precise figures are impossible to obtain. Moreover, the commodity price movement in Central China is not only restricted by pure economic laws, but also affected by various conditions outside the economy, and its complexity is difficult to describe in detail.</p>
<p>The article "Suppressing and Leveling Prices and Managing Materials" by Meng Zou, published in Shen Bao on the 22nd of last month, put forward very novel insights into the most serious commodity price problem currently encountered in the Central China economy, and I think general readers will find it very interesting. As the editor said in the postscript to the article, "The commodity price problem has become a political, social, and other problem, which can lead to political corruption, social chaos, insecurity, and even people's treachery and moral decline." Moreover, it is a problem that directly threatens personal life, and it is inevitable that it will attract attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Meng Zou's original text can be roughly divided into two parts. The first is to adopt a gradual price increase policy to suppress and level prices; the second is to implement a registration system to manage materials and crack down on hoarding. The core of his opinion is still to replace the maintenance of unreasonably low commodity prices with a reasonable gradual increase in commodity prices. The item of so-called implementing registration and cracking down on hoarding is to point out the defects of the current laws and regulations and institutions, so that cunning people can take the opportunity to escape, while law-abiding people have nowhere to go. Moreover, there are no regulations on the measures after registration, so the effect is not great, and hoarding still exists, and so on. In short, the core is in the first half of the article, and the latter is just a technical condition for promoting the gradual price increase policy.</p>
<p>Now, let us examine the content of the gradual price increase policy. According to the author's meaning, it is to "refer to the normal market price and market interest rate at that time, as well as the storage costs and natural consumption of various materials, and separately stipulate the base price of a certain material and the percentage of monthly price increases, and allow it to increase the price gradually every month." In other words, it is to make the increase in commodity prices regular, so that it increases gradually to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The increase in commodity prices during wartime is originally unavoidable. As mentioned above, for huge war expenses, expenditures for expanding production undertakings, etc., the government has to create currency. The economic policies during wartime aim to reduce the circulation speed on the currency side, and to increase the circulation speed on the material side. The purpose of encouraging savings and cracking down on hoarding lies in this. Therefore, in Meng Zou's so-called "base price of a certain material" and "percentage of monthly price increases," the proportion of storage costs and natural consumption is naturally very small, and the main thing is the so-called "normal market price" and "market interest rate at that time."</p>
<p>Whether the "normal market price" is calculated using cost is not stipulated in the original text, so we will not discuss it for the time being. Only in terms of market interest rates, what is the market interest rate? It is the profit rate generated by general monetary capital on the market, which is itself the so-called black market, "mostly determined by how much profit is made from hoarding at that time." In our economic organization, although the profits of various capitals have their ups and downs, they are roughly average. In Shanghai, lending money to others or doing business often yields similar benefits. If doing business is particularly good, people with money will not lend money or operate factories. The prices of various materials also generally rise at an average rate, but some of them have particularly sharp increases.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine the relationship between commodity prices and market interest rates. There are of course three kinds of price fluctuations:</p>
<p>(1) The rise and fall of the two are consistent.</p>
<p>(2) The price of a certain commodity rises faster than the so-called base price plus the market interest rate in Shanghai;</p>
<p>(3) The opposite of the second example, that is, the price of a certain commodity rises slower than the so-called base price plus the market interest rate.</p>
<p>Then Meng Zou's so-called gradual price increase policy can only be applied to the first example, but the second and third examples cannot be applied. So, may I ask, what should be done when the price of a certain material does not rise according to the market interest rate?</p>
<p>Secondly, commodity prices are not as mechanical as Meng Zou imagined, rising at a certain rate. Taking edible oil prices as an example, the Shanghai market price in February of this year was about 95 yuan per catty. Until mid-August, not only did it not rise, but sometimes it even tended to fall. If the gradual price increase policy is followed, merchants will instead avoid the dangers of the supply and demand law of the free economic mechanism, which is tantamount to encouraging merchants to hoard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the premise for implementing the gradual price increase policy is said to be to crack down on hoarding, and the author has also put forward very good opinions on the defects of the current institutions. However, cracking down on hoarding requires strong political power as a prerequisite, which seems not very easy at present. In fact, today's so-called market interest rate is composed of the profit of monetary capital and the loss part of the decline in currency purchasing power, and it is not much different from the profits of other capitals. It should have been controlled and suppressed itself. Then, the price calculated based on it will not be much different from the natural upward trend of today's commodity prices. If the result is like this, then the so-called gradual price increase policy is also a laissez-faire policy.</p>
<p>In short, the commodity price policy should be comprehensive, including materials, currency, labor, transportation, etc., and is related to many aspects. What we hope for is also this kind of comprehensive countermeasure.</p>

<p>In view of the gradually cold weather and the urgent need for winter relief, the Shanghai Municipal Government authorities are organizing the "Shanghai Special City 33rd Year Winter Relief Committee," with Municipal Secretary Wu Songgao concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee, and Director Zhou Yuying of the Social Welfare Bureau and Standing Committee Member Chen Riping of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee serving as vice chairmen. Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Sun Lifu, Lu Ying, Ling Xianwen, Feng You, etc. are members. The committee held its inaugural meeting in the municipal government conference room on the 1st of this month, and passed the organizational regulations. Zhao Jinqing and Gu Nanqun were added as members. After discussion, in addition to holding routine relief activities such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, and setting up cold shelters, active relief work is also planned. In terms of funding, 200 million yuan will be allocated from the food storage certificates issued at the suggestion of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and 50 million yuan will be raised by the Citizens Welfare Association to purchase miscellaneous grains for distribution, and the Commercial and Statistical Association will allocate more than 10 million yuan. In terms of personnel, because winter relief is temporary in nature, staff will be borrowed from various charitable organizations and newspaper social service departments with successful experience, without paying salaries.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Advisory Committee held its tenth plenary meeting in the municipal government conference room at 3 pm yesterday. More than 20 committee members attended, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Dai Ailu, Chen Riping, Li Quanshi, Xiang Kangyuan, Shen Siliang, Yao Qingsan, Jin Xiongbai, etc. Mayor Chen was in Beijing on official business, and Secretary-General Wu Songgao presided on his behalf. Directors of various bureaus of the municipal government were also invited to participate. Chairman Li Changwei was ill and Chairman Lin Kanghou presided. Two important cases were discussed: (1) A proposal to suggest that the municipal government issue the 34th year of the Republic of China interim relief storage certificates for the purpose of compensating for the difference in adjusted and allocated people's food rice prices and for relief undertakings was passed unanimously. (2) The Municipal Government sought the opinion of the Municipal Advisory Committee on the collection of business tax within the Old 18 districts, which was passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 5 pm.</p>

<p>The 16th period of household sugar registration ended on November 30th. The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office issued the following statement on the sugar price issue: "When the Greater East Asia War broke out, there were more than 800,000 dan of sugar in the warehouses of various sugar firms. At that time, because sugar was included in the controlled goods, this office was established by the collective organization of the industry to meet the needs of the times, and the sugar was centrally managed and distributed. The price sold was officially set by the authorities, and the sugar price has remained constant for two years. However, the 800,000 dan of sugar have been distributed in full at the beginning of this year. The sugar distributed recently is all allocated from the sugar transported to Shanghai by our friendly countries to meet the needs of the people. Each period of this office only takes the legally stipulated profit according to the cost of entry, which is reviewed and announced by the distribution authorities. However, the sugar transported to Shanghai by our friendly countries is mainly for the exchange of materials. The price of the exchanged native products is high, so the price of the exchanged sugar also rises accordingly, and the transportation costs are becoming huge. Therefore, the recent high sugar price is a truly unavoidable fact."</p>

<h3 id="e15">Chief Justice Li Talks About Prevention Plans and Will Organize Various Crime Prevention Committees <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Crime Prevention Committee of the Judicial Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau, in order to promote the meaning of crime prevention and raise crime prevention funds, performed the crime prevention drama "Turning Back is the Shore" at the Lyceum Theater last month. In order to make the public understand the play's performance process, ticket revenue, and the management and use of funds, the department specially held a tea party for the press at the Duchen Hotel at 4 pm yesterday (2nd) to provide detailed reports. Chief Justice Li Shiyu, Deputy Chief Guan Xianerlang, Chief of the Crime Prevention Section Yang Xiongshi, Secretary Zhang Fengzheng, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers attended. Chief Justice Li reported briefly: "We know that Mayor Chen came to Shanghai with the mission of purifying the turbid Shanghai, building a new, clean and prosperous Shanghai, and realizing clean politics. This is the most sublime political ideal. In other words, it is to reduce and eliminate all evils in society, so that our country can advance to a modern country ruled by law. In order to achieve this lofty ideal, crime prevention is even more urgent. After several months of research, the method of promoting crime prevention work must be carried out with the three mutually complementary methods of guidance, control, and remedy. The laws and nature have been published several times. In short, we are seeking treatment methods for the social ills, hoping to reduce crime and even eliminate crime, that is, to eliminate harm and increase welfare. Individual legal rights are guaranteed, social order can be peaceful, and national laws can maintain their respect. Therefore, there is the promotion of crime prevention movements, and therefore the performance of the anti-crime drama "Turning Back is the Shore" to raise crime prevention funds.</p>
<p>For the convenience of work, we organized a crime prevention movement propaganda committee to promote this matter. Regarding the pricing method, although the price of the honorary ticket is relatively high, in order to raise funds, it must be a little higher, otherwise it will not be enough for the original plan. However, before selling the tickets, we decided on several principles: first, sell to legitimate gentry; second, no coercive means should be used to sell; third, sell to those who understand the meaning of our raising crime prevention funds and sincerely support them. As a result of this performance, the total ticket revenue was 18.75 million yuan. After deducting expenses such as actor remuneration, venue fees, scenery, props, advertising, and office expenses, the net surplus was more than 14 million yuan. The detailed accounts will be published in the recently planned "Turning Back is the Shore" special edition. Regarding this fund, we organized a crime prevention fund management committee. In addition to the department being responsible, we will also hire members of the Municipal Advisory Committee to participate, and plan to deposit it in a famous bank in this city, with the monthly interest used as crime prevention business expenses and office expenses. From then on, the development of crime prevention work can be guaranteed to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>In the future, in addition to the recently planned crime prevention movement propaganda week, we will first organize a crime prevention propaganda committee, a crime prevention research committee, and a crime prevention editorial committee to engage in preliminary work. We also plan to solicit crime prevention sponsorship committee members, set up legal lectures at various radio stations, and issue special publications. Once the time is ripe, we will further organize the Citizens Crime Prevention Association, and the crime prevention work must be widely carried out and achieve practical results."</p>
<h3 id="e16">Reader's Scholarship News: We Respectfully Hope Readers Will Show a Kind Thought and Jointly Sponsor Special Fundraising <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Because we expect that the number of scholarships needed in the next session will be even greater, and we cannot bear to order the lovely poor students to drop out halfway, we have launched a "special fundraising team" and earnestly request readers to help. In the past two days, we have received enthusiastic responses from readers. However, our goal is to raise 1,000 teams within a month, with a minimum of 20,000 yuan per team. One thousand teams in one month requires 33 teams every day. Now we have received 10 teams in two days, which is only one-sixth of the target. This makes us feel apprehensive. However, based on past experience and the widespread recognition of this work, we have firm confidence that enthusiastic people in society will not ignore it and will sympathize with our work. For example, the letter from Mr. Li Mingchen published today (see below) and the donation from Mr. Shi Liangcai's old friend both contain very profound meanings. The personnel in society are complex. Whenever there is gratitude and repayment, resolving disputes, there are gifts. Whenever there are celebrations and funerals, friends and relatives have gifts. If both the giver and the receiver can give in the form of scholarships and extend it, then this gift transfer will exceed our goal. Therefore, we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will respond together, and we will pray with great sincerity.</p>
<p>Gratitude Reward Transferred to Scholarship</p>
<p>Mr. Li Mingchen from Shandong wrote: "Dear Sir, I used to be a merchant in Shanghai and had a son named Jiaqing. I went north for business and entrusted Ms. Lu Xiuying to educate and raise him. Later, due to environmental reasons, I was unable to come south for 13 years, and there was no news. I am deeply indebted to Ms. Xiuying. Recently, I came to Shen and saw that my son has grown up and is about to graduate from elementary school. In addition to the reunion of father and son, I am grateful for the great virtue and engraved it in my heart. I also instructed my son to never forget it. In addition to repaying it in the future, the board and teaching fees for Ms. Lu for more than ten years should be settled, but Ms. Lu refused to accept any money. I asked Mr. Wu Xiqing and Song Ziyuan to say something to her, but she still refused. I have nothing to repay, so I donated 40,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates to the scholarship funds established by your newspaper and Xinwenbao as blessings for Ms. Lu, to promote benevolence and express my humble sincerity. This is to Shenbao."</p>
<p>Achievement Exhibition Extended for Two Days</p>
<p>The exhibition of achievements of scholarship students held by the scholarship office of this newspaper was the second day yesterday. Guests from all walks of life came to visit the exhibition more enthusiastically. After browsing, some praised, some were reluctant to put down the books, and some lingered. It is even more evident that the hard work of the poor students at ordinary times inspires people. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial giants, social leaders, and enthusiastic donors in Shanghai will take time to visit and give guidance.</p>
<p>The exhibition period was originally scheduled for three days and will close today. However, in view of the difficulty of collecting achievements and the great concern of people from all walks of life, this newspaper is deeply afraid that the exhibition period is too short and some people may regret it. We have specially obtained the consent of the authorities of the Youth Association and extended the exhibition period for two days, until 5 pm on the 5th (Tuesday). We hope that readers will take this into consideration.</p>
<p>Scholarship Received Yesterday: The Shanghai Youth Journalists Association established a frugality ceremony to transfer 10,000 yuan to the Chen Mayor Scholarship, 2,000 yuan from Mr. 1129, 1,100 yuan from Customs colleagues (surplus of Baojia expenses), and 600 yuan from Yao Zichu (celebrating the opening ceremony of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank). A total of 13,700 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was received, and the balance was 6,761,515 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Responding to the Air Force: Record of Japanese Submarine Successes Undersea <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>In the fiercely fought Southwest Pacific, the valiant efforts of Japanese submarines, complementing the exploits of the air force, have achieved astonishing victories. Since sinking and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier each in the sea east of Halmahera on October 3rd, submarine captain Morinaga sank one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, as well as four or more transport ships, on October 24th and 25th. Japanese submarines are overcoming all sorts of difficulties and building a glorious pyramid of war achievements in the Pacific. Below is the battle record of the submarine that sank and destroyed one enemy aircraft carrier each.</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>To cover the landings, the enemy's guard of Morotai Island was indeed very strict. As our submarine was about to enter a certain waterway, two patrol boats suddenly appeared in front of us. Fortunately, we submerged quickly and were not detected. Submarine captain Mito Shiizuka, Lieutenant Commander, resolved to force his way into the waterway, but it was impossible to break through the heavily guarded entrance. Therefore, the bow was turned to the southeast sea of Morotai Island. From the evening of October 2nd, a strong southeast wind blew at sea, and the turbulent waves violently shook the hull. Our target was the enemy's mobile unit. At this time, the brave men who were operating the submarine, making it sink or float, had only one thought: to sink the enemy's aircraft carrier. In the darkness, the watchmen struggled with the stormy waves, concentrating on their work. The long night passed, and the horizon was faintly white. It was the dawn of October 3rd. The order for a long submerged voyage was given, and our ship's shadow quietly disappeared from the sea east of Morotai. At 6:20 AM, a report suddenly came to the conning tower from the listening room. According to the listening officer, he had heard a group sound of a width of twenty degrees.</p>
<p>Man Your Stations</p>
<p>How could we let such good prey escape? The nerves of the entire ship seemed to be completely concentrated on the ears of the listening officer at this time. The group sound was getting closer and closer. The captain confidently and contentedly gave the order: "Man your stations!" "Prepare for torpedo attack!" The enemy ships emitting rumbling sounds must be several in number. The captain judged that they were the enemy's mobile unit that we were expecting and repeatedly exposed the periscope to the surface, but he could not see the shadow of the ships. Time passed second by second, and the cautious captain concentrated his attention, carefully directing the submarine to approach the target. Suddenly, two Lockheed aircraft appeared in the periscope; their altitude was one thousand meters. Hmm, the enemy's vigilance is not lax! If we were discovered by them, then all our hard work would be in vain. So, we continued to make large zigzag movements with great care. But if we made a wrong judgment, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would be lost.</p>
<p>At 7:17 AM, some black smoke was faintly visible in the periscope.</p>
<p>"Battle, torpedo attack!"</p>
<p>The torpedo room suddenly became tense, and air was pumped into the torpedoes.</p>
<p>At 7:26 AM, the captain finally spotted a mast on the starboard bow. The sound had been heard long ago, but the shadow of the enemy ship could not be seen until this time. The captain was indescribably happy, gripping the periscope tightly. The sea was still windy and wavy, and several times it almost lifted the submarine out of the sea. Even if the white waves stirred up by the periscope were not detected by the enemy, wouldn't it be even more dangerous if the submarine itself was exposed? The well-trained soldiers did their best to steer the submarine like a steed, preventing it from surfacing.</p>
<p>Before long, after the mast that looked like a cruiser, many more masts appeared. The listening officer's ears also heard what sounded like the engines of large ships. At 7:43 AM, two destroyers were finally clearly visible. The captain decided to quickly break through the enemy's circular formation. According to the enemy's circular formation, the aircraft carrier air force fleet was concentrated in the center, and its outer perimeter was quite large. Therefore, the aircraft carrier could not be seen at this time. After passing the destroyer guarding on the right side, we finally saw three aircraft carriers. The distance between them was about 1,500 meters. Two in front and one in the back. Haha, these were the American aircraft carrier groups we had dreamed of! At this time, the enemy ships were continuing to make large-angle zigzag movements.</p>
<p>One Hit</p>
<p>The nearest aircraft carrier had many aircraft neatly arranged on the aft of the flight deck. When the captain thought that these aircraft were the very ones that were attacking the Japanese ground troops on Morotai Island, he became even more determined to deliver a fatal blow. However, the first aircraft carrier escaped the firing point due to a change of course. Therefore, the captain stared at the two aircraft carriers behind him and ordered "Surface." However, although the submarine's horizontal rudder operator tried desperately, the submarine could not float up as desired due to the stormy waves. In the meantime, the captain gritted his teeth helplessly. Later, the tip of the mast was finally exposed, and the top of the submarine's conning tower was slowly exposed. The time was exactly 8:02 AM. Multiple aircraft were placed on the aft flight decks of the two aircraft carriers, with twenty or thirty of them covering the edges. The torpedoes were launched at the aircraft carriers. The captain felt somewhat empty because the surfacing was slow, the launch was slightly late, and there was little hope of a hit. However, God blessed us. After 0.0 seconds, we heard a loud rumbling sound in the water. Hit! The captain did not expect that the launched torpedoes would hit. He even thought it was the sound of a depth charge exploding. However, three more sounds of hits came later. Our four torpedoes had hit the enemy aircraft carrier's huge body.</p>
<p>Soon, the enemy destroyer approached us. Depth charges began to explode above us. At 8:52 AM, a huge explosion seemed to turn the sea upside down. Although we were hiding on the seabed, we clearly understood that one of the enemy aircraft carriers had been sunk. The enemy ships dropped about ten depth charges per minute, and there were even more bombs from the aircraft, as if hundreds of them were dropped at the same time. The rumbling sound was incessant, and the submarine was sometimes shaken violently, as if being hit on the head with a hammer. They were trying to retaliate.</p>
<p>In this way, we attacked the enemy aircraft carrier group in broad daylight. In the turbulent waves of battle, we established the special feat of sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and destroying one [more]. (Report from Heishu News Team) (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, November 8th)</p>

<p>— Xu Ming</p>
<p>Min — a ten-year-old child.</p>
<p>He heard his mother say that his father was coming back, and he was very happy. He knew that his father would bring delicious food and fun toys for him. He was extremely happy and immediately told this news to his friends, as if to say: "My father is back. Do you still dare to bully me? You should admire me and be my prisoners."</p>
<p>As soon as he heard the sound of the whistle, Min thought to himself: "Dad must be coming back today. Mom said, "Dad left from X Port yesterday and took the ship home from X this morning." Maybe he has already gotten off the ship… arrived on the street… at the door.""</p>
<p>"Knock…" Someone was knocking on the door.</p>
<p>"Dad is back," Min shouted, jumping up and down to open the door. Every time he saw that it was not his father, the boiling enthusiasm turned into great disappointment and he returned without interest.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would secretly run to the pier alone, darting around in the crowd. After all the passengers had dispersed, there was no sign of his father, and he was disappointed again.</p>
<p>"Perhaps when I ran to the east just now, Dad went back from the west." He thought suspiciously. He was very regretful that he shouldn't have run around, so his already cold heart began to burn again. He jumped home quickly with a glimmer of hope, but the reality was not as he imagined.</p>
<p>This kind of thing happened several times, which really disappointed and disheartened his little heart too much. Therefore, on the day his father returned, he didn't do that anymore. He was very ashamed and also sad, ashamed that he didn't have the perseverance and sad that his previous efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>This time, his father came back to take his mother to X Port for medical treatment. Min naturally wanted to go with them. Taking a car, riding a boat, and going to other places was such an exciting thing, especially in Min's mind. He told this news to his friends again.</p>
<p>"Mom, are you taking me with you?" Min asked a little worriedly.</p>
<p>"The date of departure is still early! You go to school properly. On the day we leave, I will definitely tell you so that you can say goodbye to your friends." His mother replied vaguely.</p>
<p>One morning, as soon as he woke up, he saw his mother packing her suitcase, so he quickly got up.</p>
<p>"Mom, are we leaving today? Don't forget to put my newly made school uniform in the suitcase." Min added, "I don't have to go to school today."</p>
<p>"No, there is no ship today, we can only leave tomorrow! Today is your last day at home, Min. You still have to go to school. A good student should read for one day if he has one day."</p>
<p>Min didn't want to go to school today. He was afraid that his mother would trick him, but in order to say goodbye to his friends, he happily took his schoolbag and went to school.</p>
<p>He had no intention of listening to the lessons taught by the teacher. He only worried about his parents. Would they leave today? At the same time, he also hoped that school would be dismissed soon so that he could go back and see what was going on.</p>
<p>When he entered the door, he knew that the situation was not good. It was quiet and there was no sign of his parents. He asked his grandmother, who only said that they had gone out to buy things and would be back soon. Min didn't believe it. Even though his grandmother was stopping him and calling him, he couldn't suppress his angry emotions. He ran out in one breath.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the pier, he saw that his parents had not yet boarded the ship.</p>
<p>"Dad, I'm here too," he said joyfully, jumping up and down.</p>
<p>Dad didn't answer, looking unhappy. In the end, his mother comforted him and said:</p>
<p>"Here is a bag of snacks. Take it back and eat it yourself! I will be back in a few days. You have to listen to your grandmother at home and study hard. What do you want in the future? Write a letter and I will definitely buy it for you. Be good, Mom is going to see a doctor."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Min couldn't help but burst into tears. He didn't want to leave, but when he stole a glance at his father's stern face, he didn't dare to say a word. He wiped away the tears with his sleeves, took the bag of snacks, and walked back step by step listlessly.</p>
<p>Min still went to school as usual, but he didn't seem as innocent and lively as before.</p>
<p>"Little Min, why didn't you go to X Port with your mother?" His friends often joked with him.</p>
<p>A blush appeared on his face, and a sad atmosphere made him remain silent.</p>
<p>Min's mother left for a week… a month… two months, and still didn't come back. At first, Min felt lonely without his mother's love, but as time went by, he gradually neglected it.</p>
<p>His personality became calm, and his mind became dull. Whenever there were temple fairs in the city, he rarely set foot there. He only sat alone at home, reading some books from time to time, and when he was upset, he lay on the bed trying to find some happiness in his dreams.</p>
<p>Originally, it was the most heartbreaking thing for a child to be separated from his mother. It was as if a person had lost his warm coat, wandering on the streets, miserable and lonely…</p>

<p>— Lan Ping</p>
<p>…Three years, the long years of high school!</p>
<p>Opening the photo album, I accidentally saw a photo from five years ago. It was taken when I first entered high school. Round face, lively posture, where have they all gone?</p>
<p>The three years of high school have turned me into a different person. It took away my plump cheeks and lively nature; it turned me into a cold and lonely person.</p>
<p>…After finishing the first year of junior high school in my hometown, I came to Shanghai with the ambition of winning. I learned to be proud of my supreme glory. But at the same time, I found a very high mountain standing in front of me—although my Chinese and English levels could barely keep up with the students in my class, mathematics, physics, and chemistry were simply something I had never been exposed to before. Asking someone who has never studied algebra to jump directly to trigonometry and geometry is a heavy and difficult task! Climb! I climbed desperately, using the strength of every muscle in my body to climb upwards. Glory! My young body was actually able to climb over such a high mountain and overcome such heavy difficulties, but, heavens! Where is my plump, round face?</p>
<p>…Under a lonely light, my whole head was buried in piles of books. I forgot the clock on the table, forgot the chilly winter night. My parents had already started snoring, and my younger siblings were having their beautiful dreams. In addition to organizing my schoolwork, I also had to re-learn the books from junior high school that I had never read. There was no one to teach, no one to help, and everything was up to my own mind to open up my path. At least I didn't stand up wearily until the clock struck twelve, looking at the pitch-black night outside the window, listening to the complete absence of human voices on the ground, and feeling a pang of sadness in my heart.</p>
<p>…I got a score of thirty-two on my first monthly math test, my God! A bullet shot into my chest. This was the first time I had failed a test since entering school. I felt the teacher's cold contempt for me; my classmates were laughing, and the whole universe was looking at me with disdain. At night, in the dim light, I held the test paper and shed countless tears. I was the one who had taken first place and won awards!</p>
<p>"Let him go! At most, he'll just repeat a grade." Such voices would often come from the bottom of my heart. But reason immediately awakened me.</p>
<p>"No, it can't be like this. Ping! You have brains and the vigor of youth. Work hard! Climb to that mountain!"</p>
<p>…Looking at stacks of books, sometimes tears would flow, but these tears flowed inward. I became a lonely person. As soon as I came back from school, I would hide in my room alone, flipping through page after page of books filled with words, doing heavy exercises. I put down the books when it was time to eat, but the shadow of Sine-Cosine remained in my mind. After eating, I went back to the books again. My parents and siblings were telling stories, looking at picture books, and listening to the radio, but I had no share in it. It wasn't that I didn't want to participate, but where did I get the time? Sometimes I saw them playing so happily and ran over to listen for a while, but a thought quickly pulled me back to my room. My homework wasn't finished yet! Books isolated me from society. For three years, I completely lived in a monastery isolated from the world, not understanding human relationships, not understanding the ways of the world, only knowing books! Piles of thick books, not knowing what is called sociability, what is called the vitality of youth. The rosy cheeks gradually disappeared, and the lively and active personality completely changed. I was simply not like a vigorous young man, like autumn grass whispering about vicissitudes under people's feet, like a morning without sunlight!</p>
<p>…My parents took my giggling siblings to see movies and eat Western food, of course, calling me to go too. Why wouldn't I be happy to go? But when I thought that the teacher would still have to ask about my homework tomorrow, I gritted my teeth and shook my head, saying I wouldn't go. My mother looked at me with pity and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go together! It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter about this little homework."</p>
<p>But I always didn't dare to go. Even if I went, I wouldn't be in the mood to have fun.</p>
<p>"Well then, I'll bring you back some delicious food."</p>
<p>I watched their happy figures walk out the door, and tears almost filled my eyes.</p>
<p>Although I surprisingly jumped to eighty points on the second monthly exam, I paid the price!</p>
<p>…One moonless night, I was doing a problem, but I couldn't figure it out no matter what I did, and I was so anxious that I almost wanted to tear up the problem. My mother got up, glanced at the light in my room, and slowly opened the door and came in. Seeing that I was still at the desk not asleep, she touched my shoulder with very compassionate emotion:</p>
<p>"Ping'er, you go to sleep quickly! It's so late, Mom and Dad know you're working hard, be careful not to damage your health."</p>
<p>My throat choked up and I couldn't speak, forcibly holding back the tears, and let her pull me to the bed. She watched me lie down, carefully arranged the quilt around my shoulders, turned off the light, and tiptoed out.</p>
<p>"You go to sleep well!" she poked her head in again and said…</p>
<p>…Three years of time were like the wheels of a train, slowly rolling over my body. I graduated, gloriously ranked first among forty-two people. My classmates cast envious and admiring glances at me, and the teacher used me as an example to encourage the students. Relatives and friends were praising me to each other, my dad bought me a pen, and my mom specially bought me a pork knuckle…</p>
<p>I held the diploma and looked at the pale moonlight pouring in from the window. In those thousand days of long time, I don't know how many tears I had forcibly held back, and in there, I was changed into a different person. Looking at my two thin hands, and then looking at the diploma in my hand. In the moonlight, the diploma was wet with two drops of tears…</p>

<h3 id="e31">"Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A: Hua Lian vs. Zhongbei Tomorrow Night's Decisive Battle - A Masterful Performance Is Guaranteed When Two Heroes Meet <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A, is nearing completion, with only the decisive battle between Hua Lian and Zhongbei remaining tomorrow. The purpose of this basketball league organized by our newspaper is to promote sports, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be used to subsidize scholarships, a win-win situation. We are delighted by the enthusiastic participation of the various teams and their adherence to the rules of the competition in each game. We are also grateful for the assistance provided by the Basketball Association and the Referees Association. Furthermore, the enthusiastic attendance of fans has added to the spirit of the games, for which we express our deepest gratitude. The standings and results table for Group A are attached below. As for Group B, the six teams are all in the final stages of the competition.</p>
<p>Group A Standings Settled</p>
<p>Hua Lian, with victories in all matches, proudly holds the top spot. If they can defeat Zhongbei in one fell swoop tomorrow, they will not only win the championship but also maintain their undefeated glory. If they are unfortunately defeated by Zhongbei, their points will be equal, and another decisive match will be held. The Zhongbei team currently has seven wins and one loss, temporarily ranking second. If they can win against Hua Lian, their hopes for the future remain strong. Conversely, they will be tied for second place with the Shan and Hua Nan teams. The Da Hua team, due to poor luck and frequent absences of players, ranks fifth. Ren Yu and Mingxing are tied for sixth place with three wins and six losses each. After much effort, the Hua Ying and Tong Ren teams have demonstrated excellent sportsmanship but are tied for eighth place with two wins and seven losses. The V team has suffered repeated defeats and is relegated to the bottom.</p>
<p>Increased Ticket Prices Benefit Students</p>
<p>The purpose of this league organized by our newspaper has long been understood by all sectors of society. As stated in this article, the intention is clearly not for profit. It has been decided that the ticket prices for the final will be increased slightly, with upstairs seats costing three hundred yuan and downstairs seats costing five hundred yuan. The reason for this is to create a slight restriction to maintain order more easily and to increase the benefits for scholarships, benefiting underprivileged students. We hope that all sectors of society will understand this.</p>
<p>Here, before tomorrow's big battle, the author will briefly comment on the strengths of the two teams and offer a simple prediction:</p>
<p>Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory - A Team of Success</p>
<p>Hua Lian is organized by colleagues from the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, led and guided by Mr. Zhang Huixiang, the general manager of the factory. Mr. Zhang is not only dedicated to the sport but also experienced in basketball tactics. Since organizing the Hua Lian team, he has used rational training, resulting in daily progress and outstanding results. Almost invincible, their reputation has shaken Shanghai. The team's overall strength and physical fitness of the players are extremely abundant, and the talent is balanced. Therefore, they can make full substitutions, which is superior to other teams. Each player also has the ability to shoot, which is even more valuable. The special feature of their tactics is their ability to adapt to circumstances and attack the opponent's weaknesses, making them a truly successful team.</p>
<p>Zhonghua Showcases Northern Style</p>
<p>The members of the Zhongbei team are mostly veterans, and some are national players, so they are highly praised by fans. The coach, Dai Changling, has a long-standing reputation in the basketball world. With his guidance, they can naturally find their place. The captain, Zai Zhongtao, was highly praised by people in Tokyo for his basketball skills when he studied in Tokyo in his early years, which is a perfect complement. The most obvious weakness of Zhongbei this time is their lack of stamina. It is said that this is due to the fact that many team members are employed in various positions, resulting in fewer opportunities to practice. However, their beautiful movements and agile shots still showcase the unique characteristics of the northern style, which is a consistent praise from fans.</p>
<p>Simple Prediction Offers a Contribution</p>
<p>Based on the discussion and recent observations, Hua Lian has a greater chance of winning. This is because they have a psychological advantage, abundant stamina, skillful cooperation, and accurate shooting. As for Zhongbei, it is not without a chance of winning, and it depends on the stamina of the team members in this battle, which is most important. If they can maintain the stamina of the first ten minutes and fight to the end, then I dare not say that they will definitely lose. Furthermore, their victory will also be more certain.</p>
<p>Hua Lian</p>
<p>In today's battle, they will likely first test the waters with Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xianlun, and Bo Tuo, guarded by Qu Xilin and Kong Guangyi. In fact, this lineup is more ideal. However, against Zhongbei, which has many tall players, it seems difficult to achieve Qin Xiao's effect by having Xianlun frequently break through and using the over-the-head shot. It is thought that if necessary, they can try using Quan Changchun's short and lively style, relying on his breakthroughs, and also having Fan Qinggong shoot, as he also has the strengths of the northern style. They can take the opportunity to test him in today's battle. If they can fight poison with poison, then reuse him, otherwise, retire him. Furthermore, today Wu Chengfeng will inevitably be closely marked by Chen Xuechong. Hua Lian should add a considerable strategy to find opportunities to gain the ball under the basket, especially for the ball under their own basket, to avoid being followed up by the opponent. In short, the author believes that the above points are all that need special attention today. As for the tactics, Zhang Huaixiang, Ling Youling, and the two gentlemen will naturally guide them, and the players will naturally perform, so there is no need for the author to talk too much.</p>
<p>Zhongbei</p>
<p>The formal lineup and combat strategy seem to lack a central purpose, so let's discuss it. In my opinion, they should first use tall players to fight. The forwards should be Chen Xuechong, Li Zhenzhong, and Shen Weigong, and the guards should be Zhao Yalin and Li Binzhong. In this opportunity, try using high-altitude passing, which may be effective. It may also be convenient to intercept the ball under the basket. I don't know if you think so? However, it seems that Li Zhenzhong should be a rear guard, as he can dribble the ball out and pass it to attack. Then, he can switch positions with Zhao Yalin, which is also not impossible. As for the combat strategy, they must not use the zone defense technique rigidly, nor can they use the absolute man-to-man system. In short, the two methods can be used in parallel. It can also be said to be a zone man-to-man system. Once a position is established, the opponent should be immediately approached in their own area to force them to release the ball, disrupting their chance to implement their tactics steadily. They should also pay special attention to gaining possession of the ball and following up under the basket.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this battle will definitely have an unprecedented masterpiece. It is hoped that both sides will not only strive for victory and showcase their skills but also maximize the spirit of sportsmanship and ethics, leaving a memorable page in the "Shen Bao" Cup League, so that everyone is happy and meritorious.</p>

<h3 id="e32">"Shen Bao" Cup Basketball Tomorrow Night's Group A Final - The Hope of a Loyal Fan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>In the "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A championship, Hua Lian and Zhongbei will compete in the final tomorrow night. If Hua Lian wins, the champion will be decided. If Zhongbei wins, there will be another decisive match. Given the superb skills of the two teams, this game will be the most exciting of the season, as expected. However, perhaps one side is eager to win the championship, and the audience may stimulate them from the sidelines, which may reduce the excitement. As one of the loyal fans, who loves both teams, I hereby list several hopes below, so that this unprecedented event of the season can be a complete success.</p>
<p>(1) Recently, the audience in the gymnasium has not paid much attention to order, shouting recklessly. They do not know that this kind of behavior greatly stimulates the players in the more intense competition, making it easy to overstep the boundaries and commit fouls. Tomorrow night's game will definitely be very tense. It is hoped that the audience will watch the skills quietly and not give the players unnecessary stimulation, so that the game can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>(2) The players on both sides are naturally eager to win the championship, but it is hoped that they will abide by sportsmanship, show the spirit of athletes, and give full play to the high and wonderful skills of basketball. Victory is commendable, and defeat is not disgraceful.</p>
<p>(3) The hosts of the two teams, Zai Zhongtao, Zhang Huixiang, and Dai Changling, are all the highest responsible authorities of the Shanghai Basketball Association and should have sufficient training for the players' actions. Therefore, the smooth progress of this game is not a problem in itself. If there are any transgressions, the Basketball Association and the team authorities should pay attention to it from their standpoints.</p>
<p>(4) The referees are the hosts of the game, wielding the highest authority. Therefore, the referees of this game should be decisive, and clear refereeing can also make the game more perfect. (Lu Zhenying)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Rare News in the Sports World <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Basketball referee Yang Liecheng, it is said that he was very popular in the outer dock when the poet Shu Shi was the protagonist of "Lan Xin Yi Dang Ren Hun." Liu Fuji is the protagonist of "Golden Little Prince" in Paris. Therefore, the skills of the two generals are not seen in the basketball hall. Li Zude, who is ill in Wuxi, is said to have good news that he has turned the corner.</p>
<p>Dai Linjing was honorably appointed as the assistant manager of Lisheng Trust Bank. The previous issue mistakenly wrote it as Limin Bank. This is corrected.</p>
<p>Miss Shi Ruijuan of the Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team has seen her enthusiasm for basketball greatly reduced due to the approaching wedding. Therefore, there are great differences in whether the Three Provinces team can be organized recently, which is entrusted to Captain Shi. (Basketball King)</p>
