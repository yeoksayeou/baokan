<p>社評　再論國民義務敎育</p>
<p>我們日前從助學論到國民義務敎育的需要，現在更願從一個大眾常見的現象裹，說明兒童敎育的重要。</p>
<p>凡是在街頭走走的，近年來時常看見人行道上的兒童們，三五成羣，聚集了打彈子。過去或許還有人留心，有人感嘆，現在大家司空見慣，巳經熟視無覩了。可是這是一個對於國家將來極嚴重的問題。當男子們應該出外工作，女子們應該整理家務，兒童們應該入學念書的時候，還有兒童不進學校而在街頭打彈子，家長們應該負多大責任？如果大多數的家長負不起繳付小學學費的重担，國家應該怎樣替這般兒童們想法子？</p>
<p>千萬不要以爲街頭流浪兒童是一件小事情！我們現在是可憐他們，過了十年八年之後，我們就要可恨他們了。只經過一個很短的時期，這般流浪兒童就要被人們從「可憐」變成「可恨」，這是誰的責任？</p>
<p>過去各國專家時常替中國做統計，都說中國文盲太多。中國自己的學者們亦常常說，中國的大病在愚。如若照現在這種兒童失學情况，任令繼續下去，恐怕十年二十年以後，我們這個國家，根本不必再做統計，文盲越益增加了。</p>
<p>一八七○年德法戰爭，德國的勝利，大家都歸功於小學敎育。一九〇四年日俄戰爭，日本的勝利，大家又歸功於小學敎育。眞是不錯。我們更可以補充的說，這不僅是小學敎育的成功，而是全國國民都能够受小學校敎育的效果。</p>
<p>國民義務敎育的重要，在理論上已經不必再討論了，問題是在怎樣能够實施。我們希望中央當局要下决心，從速籌點款，補助各省市的國民敎育經費。各省市的敎育當局應該督促管轄下全部的公私立小學校，於開學之前，立定一個寬裕的預算，這個預算，一方面顧到小學敎師生活的安定，一方面不增加學生的學費，預算不足之費，經詳細核准之後，就由地方補助，地方再由中央補助。（像現在這樣每學期增加學費，母學期敎師的生活還不能安定，每學期就學的小學生日漸减少，就算學店罷，也是矛盾自殺的現象。）爲了這件百年樹人的大事，政府不妨向銀行舉債，不妨向國民募集公債，而負責償還。現在事實上是一個國民經濟衰落問題，做家長的都希望他的兒女進學校，都願意吃得壞一點，都願意穿得破一點，替子女籌措學費。現在連節衣縮食澴不够繳學費，乃是事實上的眞困難。替各個家長解决困難的惟有全國的總家長－我們的政府。我們靜待着總家長的辦法。</p>

<h3>國家財政收支數　現每月保持平衡　最近物價劇漲與通貨無關</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　財政部於十八日下午三時，定例會見首都中外新聞記者，由該部負責人，就各記者所提出之詢問各項財政問題，詳爲解答，茲分誌於後：　最近國家財政之收支情形如何？（答）目前國家之財政收入，則以統稅爲主，其次則爲關稅所得稅監稅，每月支出預算約共三萬萬元　其中軍費約佔六成以上，收支相抵，尙能應付。　雅片禁絕後將滅少一批稅收，對此減少之數如伺彈補？（答）雅片之决意限期禁絕，誠屬可喜之事，其於整個稅收實毫無影響，且事實上亦原非以此項稅收最為正當收入，故無庸考慮其彌補之法。　在結日僑遵章向國府納稅後，對於國府之稅收上約可增加若干？（答）日僑之課稅幾數，現尙無精確統計，估計數目亦並不其大。但日僑此種精神確爲可貴，足以象徵中日合作前途之光明。　最近各地物價之狂漲，其原因固多，但一方面是否刺戟通貨之發行？（答）現在中儲券之發行額，在數量上言，固較前增加，但按其實際需用量，則根本尙未達飽和點。以在戰時下紙幣之增發，亦爲一種普通現象，故我國親在之通貨，絕不處膨脹。進言之，最近物價之劇漲，與通貨毫無關係，僅不過物資之運用未能圓滑所致。　財政部對調整金融機構工作，目前已進行至何種程度，現有金融機構似嫌過多，當局是否攷盧强令合併？（答）財政部對調整金融機構工作，仍按旣定方針督促推進，如有不按部頒規定，如期增足法定資金者，決予取締。至強令合倂金融一事。將來或因環境之演變面終于實行，但目前則尙未攷慮及此。</p>

<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在德意志週刊中著文稱：戰爭已步近最高峯，一九四四年開始後，無論在軍事方面或政治方面，均有决定性之重大發展。足以决定歐洲歷史與命運之鬥爭已愈益接折，如敵人能打倒德國，則歐洲之傾覆已屬不能避免，値茲生死關頭，吾人必須盡最後之一分力量，否則歡陸人民終必永久陷於恐怖狀態之中。歐洲人民深知如欲免於浩劫，惟有倚賴德國，决不能求諸英美。英美之目標亦隨戰事之進展而消失，蓋英美不復能將歐洲恢覆戰前地位，僅能爲共黨舖就統治歐洲之道路而已。英美旣已無能爲力，則惟有德國軍力始能阻止布爾　維克之霸佔歐陸，蘇聯今藉其宣傳以欺惑世人，而猶太人更廣為附和，藉以豪蔽世人之理智，為處作　，實令人髪指</p>

<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫北部在零點以下約十五度之寒浪，已伸展至聶泊河套以北各區，公路巳冰凍，各處均在降雪，僅克里米亞半島則有降雨之消息。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：德國實行有計劃之縮短陣綫，以獲得更多之後備作戰部隊，故巳於昨晚破壞一切軍事設備後，由斯塔拉耶羅沙（Staraya　Russa）退出，（在伊爾門湖之南）駐該地之德方部隊能與敵撤離，同時並已將一切軍械輜重運至早經準備之新陣地，蘇軍並無力阻礙德軍之動作。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德軍發言人昨日宣稱：東綫最折數日之戰事，不如二週前之激烈。德軍現在南路進行反攻中。蘇軍之冬季攻勢，自於去年十二月廿四日開始後，今巳結東，二週前激戰之多數地點，今皆歸於沉寂。全綫戰事重心現僅有二處，德軍在契爾喀賽迤西之德軍反攻，雖遇蘇軍頑抗，但仍日有進展。另一重心在維特勃斯克，德軍曾於該方面擊退蘇軍之全面攻擊。現蘇軍僅繼續威脅那爾瓦區，然該方面蘇軍之攻勢，尙不能謂為大規　之攻擊，蘇軍對浦斯柯夫（Pskov）張開之作戰，刻巳逢暗礁而陷于停頓狀態。</p>

<p>轟炸寺院斥為暴行</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　義戰線德軍司令豈賽林元帥發表聲明稱：　反軸心空軍二月十五日自晨九時半迄十時會轟炸卡西諾山頂之寺院，除將寺院完全破壞外，並死傷住民甚夥。　反軸心軍司令部會宣稱爲殲滅寺院內之德軍兵力，乃實施攻擊，然余對之則斷然否認。敎廷於數月前，即曾經由德大使館向余要求將卡西諾寺院免劃入戰區，因之余當即講求必要之處置，嚴禁德兵進人寺內，且收容重傷者亦未會利用寺院，而於矗炸之當時，難民數百因堅信寺院之中立，曾赴寺院內避難，於其附近並無一名德軍，其因矗炸而死傷者僅為僧人及美民衆。　寺院內無一名德軍，無一處軍事設施之事實，根據寺院方丈狄亞諾勒主敎署名之宣言即可證明。　寺院被破壤後，德軍當即將其劃爲德軍防衛綫，　為當然之措置。　反軸心軍亦曾轟炸敎皇離宮，殺戮義人民五百名，內並有尼儈十六名，該處德軍亦朱曾進入，德軍曾嚴守其治外法權。　余任義方面德軍總司令，茲自　指明美軍之　行，為英美及蘇聯破壞歐洲文化之新證據，余對英美戰爭指導部欲將破壞寺院之責任，轉嫁與德軍之無恥行為，實感極為憎惡。</p>

<h3>中日永久合作的途徑</h3>
<p>— 吳振脩</p>
<p>日本　政信大佐的演講，（原詞見十七及十八兩日本報　編者註。）這破日本祇有得到中國眞正的協力，才可不敗，而望在滬日人向徹底實現新政策奴力。這演講引起了中日各方面的影響，進進及接受新政策的雙方，都決意本符合埿政策的精神，向解决中日問題之途邁進。上海財界巨頭中國銀行董事長吳震脩氏亦應辻大佐的演設，基於新政策的精神，指出援助日本築成中日合作基礎的必要·表明中國經濟界人士的態度，並率直披瀝關於中國經濟建設的各種意見。以下爲其要旨：</p>
<p>大東亞建設的目標</p>
<p>這次日本議會中，建設大東亞經濟新秩序的目標，已由大東亞宣各國互惠平等共存共榮。建設共存共榮的新秩序，用過去英美式的幹法是不可能的。先作成將原料，生產動力及其設備，生產品合理地配分的大東亞經濟機構，乃是先決問題。這就是集大東亞各國代表於一堂，爲造成其理想的機構，舉行可稱爲大柬亞經濟會議的會識，以原料，生產力及生產品的分配這三點爲中心，確立東亞全體的計劃經濟。</p>
<p>正爲歐關第一次第二次大戰的爆發所示，從來的英美式經濟機稱將再引起戰爭一事。洞如觀火。賀屋藏相在議會聲明沒有恢復金本位制的意圖，允稱當然。確立這個計劃經濟，似宜採用統制大東亞各國的體系。這個方法行之於中國，其意義即爲中日經濟的調整。</p>
<p>我常常想，現在是親日，從前是抗日，因時代的不同而變更信念的中國人很多，這在日本也有同樣情形，由這樣的人物來根本解决中日問題，是困難的。不問從前現在，不爲環境所動，靜靜觀察檢討中日的根本問題，不受時代變動的支配而　解决中日間題的人士，我想，才是眞可解决中日問題的人。這些人才是爲了將來中日共存共榮而作最大努力的人。這樣的人，在中國人中有許多是不出面的。這樣的人可說是誠心等待得爲中日努力的日子的。</p>
<p>中國有一句話，呌做「各行其是」，就是各向自已的信念邁進。而其反面，便是「各行其不是一。</p>
<p>新政策的具體實現</p>
<p>最近在國策公司，敵產處分·物資統制及其他方面逐漸具體實現的事，的確可喜　增是向中國人表明日本的眞意，信賴日本的人是增加了。但是，靜觀這一年來的動態，上面的人固然不錯，而下面的人若不充分認識這種精神，結果這種佳良的行爲在下面並不能開花結實這在新政策力面不是多少可以看到一些嗎？</p>
<p>谷一大使，田尻公使以及這次辻大佐也明白說明，這種一貫性想是具體實現新政策的神儲。當然，受到新政策的中國人，也應糾正過去的態度，本東亞人的自覺，為和日本協力而繼續更勝昔日的努力。我敢斷言，這點是中國經濟界人士應該充分銘記於心的。</p>
<p>中國的自主性</p>
<p>新政策的根本在於中國的自主。所謂自主。即一任中國自行其資任和創意。這在政治·經濟·文化上，尤其是經濟方面特別如此。當然，日本的經濟和中國的封建性不同，已經近代化了。因此，在中國所無法着手的不妨由日本來做，而在中國可能辦到的則希望全歸中國辦理。</p>
<p>我常說中日資本的活動分野是明確的，例各重工業，化學工業等，中國現有的資本。捘術，生產設備，是不能和日本比擬的，所以不得不由日本經濟去幹，但在收買方面和輕工業等，助成中國活動的方法不是很好嗎？從中日合作方面而想，雙方平等，同幹一事，進行殊難圓滿。中支振興會社前總裁兒玉氏說，資本縱能合作，人的合作是不能够的；這似乎是事</p>
<p>新政策與華北</p>
<p>新政策在華北也是可以實施的。但觀事實的動向，則富華中的色彩。剛才所說的，我想在華北亦然。</p>
<p>中國的資本統一，在使經濟活動近代化這一點上，是必要的。我們非向統一中國資本的方向努力不可，是和以前相同的。關於這點，育成民族資本最爲重要，而這事除出根據新政策由日本來育成民族資本以外，是沒有別法的</p>
<p>新政策的范圍</p>
<p>日本人土中，等到新政策一且確立而到實踐的階段，便這也新政策，那也新政策，頗有同時着手種種事情的傾革。然而表面的機構變向過了分，外觀雖是新政策，而內容不是反有和其精神相背之點嗎？我想這點應該竭力避免。</p>
<p>例如華中華北，通貨複雜，統制當局相異，這如喊着新政策而使之單一化，則兩地經濟變動的影響很大，在還需嬰民生安定之時，經濟界的變動是可以造成負的結果的。旣有這樣的問題，那就祗有等到在現狀下可以班無變化地逐漸或根本加以調整時才屬可望。</p>
<p>物資交流的問題　　物資交洗是我最考慮的一點，在現狀下，阻碍物資交洗之點更多。統制物資的根本問題有下面兩點，即第一防止物資向敵區洗出，第二爲確保一定數量的軍需物費而加以統制。先前緩和十九種統制品的移動限制，即在除掉無統制必要的東西。而現在的統制品仍有十七種，但其統制是爲了達到前項目的而實施的，</p>
<p>然則如有可以確保軍需物資的方法，則有些品目多少可以緩和其統制。這不是我一個人的思想，而是一般的見解。將這點再予以檢討，我想，是應該採用使物資交洗可能的機構的，商統會的問題在於物費的統制方法，即還是集中於商統會呢，還是對於重要物資分別加以統制。但是，不論用那一種統制方法，强化機構總是必要的。</p>
<p>中國經濟界人士的動態</p>
<p>在經濟界人士中，願意協力的人固然增加，但取中立立塲的人尙不少，而且也有始終唯利是圖的人。據說在表示特別協力的態度的人中，很多是迫求權益的，反之，不出面的人中，倒有不少是認眞想到中日永久的將來的。將指導力賦與這些人，實施發揚民間總意的經濟施策，我想是很嬰緊的</p>
<p>以上已將我所信的一端簡單陳述出來，我對於辻大佐，谷大使，田尻公使所說的，不勝感佩，尤其是辻大佐八日的無綫電廣播演講，深銘我的胸中，其內容確是日本眞的呼聲。也是新中國的　呼聲。中國有句話·呌做一一動不如一靜」，我的心理也如此，决意爲中日永久和平努力。（吉：譯自二月十日大陸新報）</p>

<p>經濟界　言評</p>
<h3>經濟局長會議</h3>
<p>日前本報社評以「人事健全和戰權統一」爲題，論米統　成功的先决條件，而對於米統會所召開之幹部聯席會議，仍感覺其爲表面文章，與　常會議。初無不同之處，其結果則　案與報吿東之行　而已。凡此種種，實已成爲國內一切會議的通病，必須根本掃除，而後會議之名，始可以副會　之實？否則雖會而議，議而決，其結果乃是一個決而不行而已。</p>
<p>此次實業部鑒於各地物價　漲，甚至一日數市，以致人心惶惶不定，為念　對策，謀合理之解決，而安民生，特定本月　二日在滬召開省市經濟局長會議，急籌抑制物價對策，力求物資來源充裕，而　　令飭各該主管報與有關機關，切實執行戰時物價管理暫行條例，不使一般商販，視爲具文，似尤爲此次召開會議之動機，那末，這一個「經濟局長會議」，對於常前最嚴重的物價病態，　　成爲一帖對症發藥的有效劑了。</p>
<p>誠然經濟局是負平衡物價的實任者，可是，平衡物價有其根本方法與一般力法之不司。我們感覺目前物價形勢之嚴重與急迫，已是「遠水不救近火」了，則爲眼前計，惟有積極執行平衡物價之一般方法，其最主要者爲：　價格　止，即以某月某日一般商品約價格爲最高價格，不許超過此價格織續上漲，　取締暴利，即商人乘機高抬物價，以圖暴利者，施以最嚴厲的處罰，　管理遝銷，即對於日常用品之販遝銷售，加以嚴格管理，藉以調節供需；至於囤積居奇之取締，那是可以包括於取締暴利與管理運銷之中的。</p>
<h3>調整食品物價　須呈準評議會　市糧食局知照食業公會</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會，前曾分期評訂物品標準限價，印發各該會員同業一體遵守，惟截至目今，各業商號竟擅自變動，故意超越者，殊屬多數，貽害民生，誠匪淺鮮，今悉市糧食局，爲防制非法超越限價，制止物價漲風起見，特分令各糧食業同業公會，凡嗣後過有謂整物價，務於事前呈准物價評識委員會，始可實行，絕對不得擅自增漲，如故意達法則從嚴處訴</p>

<h3>農民的迫切呼籲　糧串無法核算</h3>
<p>— 耿靑</p>
<p>徵收地稅，全憑縣裹所發的糧串。靑浦縣的糧串，今是這樣的：首先標明糧　的姓名，其次標明糧戶應完的畝分，再次拿地的肥瘠，如一等上則，一等中則，一等下則各各規定，應納法幣多少，遂標出。至於所完的地，屬於那一等則，就不標明了。</p>
<p>所以糧戶看了敉串，無法核算，只有於投櫃完納時，你的地屬於那一等則，由立在櫃內的先生臨時指明·指明了就好很容易的和畝分相乘核算嗎？尙還不能，仍由立在櫃內的先生，信口開河地每畝分要加附加稅多少·要加圖規費多少，糧戶立在櫃外，勢不能借櫃內算盤核算，只好任他打如意算盤“結出了數目，不由你不把汗血所換的法幣遵命繳足</p>
<p>這還不算奇突，繳足了法幣，他居然給你收據一張，這收據上只載明完納了多少畝分，至收到法幣多少，絕不標出！甚望縣政當局，切實加以整頓，毋使鄕民含怨莫訴！</p>
<h3>勒索派捐</h3>
<p>— 金利民</p>
<p>年來鄕間鄕保長勒派各居民捐款態演愈烈，漫無止境。吾鄉（即浙江蕭山　柬鄉）鄉保長派捐方法：鄉長居然發號施令，召集各保長開會其召集時必先宰猪殺鶏，設席款待，派定各保巨款，限期勒繳交各執長執行，挨戶勒索，無論貧富，多者每戶每月七八百元，少者亦須數上元，又民田春花收起時，每畝派豆麥七八升，秋收時每畝勒派毅市斗三斗。此外尙有殷富捐特別捐等名目。强指各戶勒派，所担任鄕長保長甲長，均係當地無業游民，爾推我輓，藉勢凌人。故稍有農地價値者，畏禍隱忍，亦不肯出面担仃鄕保長之職，因此事情愈演愈壤，社會進於黑暗，人民陷於倒懸，所望省政縣政當局。迅速派員澈查，竭力改革當地組織機構，以蘇人民之苦，而解倒懸之危，不勝幸甚！</p>

<p>— 海田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>五分鐘的勝負時間，可惜眞人的偶數組，因爲槓子被推斜三十度以上，判定是敗了的。</p>
<p>然而最可笑的是，在那以前一停止——」的喇叭響了的時候，兩軍的姿態，在止到五分鐘的瞬間，喇叭響了·所以不得不即時停止競技動作，軍令如神——毆打着的學生是依舊不動的姿勢，被毆打着的學生也是依舊不動的姿勢。所以從全體看來，好像從前所洗行的活人賽（註：活人打扮恰如盡中之人物）再不然則如同電影發生了毛病似的。在第三者看起來，是很滑稽地——但是學生們是做愼了的·所以是雙方寂然無　的。　普通以三回戰爲定規，所以雙方都又回到規定的地點去，　時候，在自已的陣中，開始改編。無論訛也不喜歡在　子周圍專門採取守勢的·即使被毆打着，脚踢着，也不能還手，這是誰也要感到不快的·這回眞人也被　入在攻擊軍的一員。也許是因爲他的柔術被贊許了的。</p>
<p>一你是四號·所以還戰吧——所以在最後頭跟着　可以了」。</p>
<p>另一個分隊的二號生這樣親切地向眞人說着。那個學生姓湯淺，以劍術出名的攻擊軍的中堅。</p>
<p>是一眞人雖然諒　湯淺的友誼，但是被派在最後頭，確實感到不滿的。</p>
<p>因爲在第一回戰的時候，被人用拳打，用脚踢，胸中的忐忑，不但沒止下，而反　勃地湧起敢鬥的精神來了。　一　　……」眞人不由地發生　摩人打架時的吶喊　。踏在草地上的雙足。皮球一般地跳盪着。第二回開戰的時候，湯淺站在前頭，同柔這部員的新田等和敵方的遊擊隊開始街鋒了。眞人已經忍不下去，决意軍騎冲陣，開始從隊旁跑到前而去了。</p>
<p>突然地吃了一鎚，當時將敵人打倒了，又往前跑，限前已　到了敵人的陣前。跳上外　陣的背上，強烈的破擊倒在草地上。　五條大腿在目已的鼻頭前面　着。他即時決心　　了這腿縫裏去了·腿上沒有眼睛，所以敵人們不斷地自己踢着自己人。眞人的面部和背上酷苛地被蹂躪着是不待　的。地在林立的大腿的那邊，發見了槓子的底根本。抓住了　楨子，拼命的揰着兩隻手以後使像在夢中似地！</p>
<p>於是，第二回戰，歸於眞人方面軍的完全勝利。在最後的一回戰，又被判定敗戰的戰爭終了後，到浴塲去的時候，也有鼻子出血的，也有面上帶　的，但是已　沒有敵我之分了。浴塲的牆　也要被震倒了似的歡聲。有一個人開始大聲一笑，忽然問又捲入笑的旋渦中去了。一谷這個傢伙，到底是海龜。今天潛下去，立了大功。」　　　社會服務</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Adopts a Flanking Strategy, Occupies Two Hills on Maungdaw Mountain Range; British Forces Retreat from Positions North of Maungdaw</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi reports: The Southeast Asia Command announced on the night of the 16th that on the night of the 14th, Japanese forces attacked Na Ga De Ku on the Arakan front line, occupying two hills overlooking the pass of the Maungdaw mountain range. British forces have retreated from their positions north of Maungdaw.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The British forces in the area north of Maungdaw are facing a major crisis of being surrounded and annihilated due to the ingenious flanking tactics of the Japanese army, which is imminent. According to a United Press dispatch from New Delhi on the 17th, according to recent front-line news, the Japanese army has built positions in the hilly area and launched several night attacks in the past seven days. British tank units and Indian troops are still resisting stubbornly.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi states: The Southeast Asia Command announced the battle situation on the Arakan front line on the 17th as follows: Some local battles have unfolded west and northwest of Buthidaung on the Arakan front line. The Japanese army near the Na Ga De Ku gorge, which is crucial for defending the main supply line of the anti-Axis forces, intends to encircle the anti-Axis forces and launch a new offensive. The Indian 7th Division headquarters is currently defending its positions to the death.</p>
<h3>Truk Islands: Naval and Air Battle Unfolds; Japan's Strong Navy Displays Power</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the night of the 17th that the U.S. fleet began attacking the Truk Islands on the morning of the 16th, and that hundreds of U.S. aircraft participated in the operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the U.S. Central Pacific Force forcibly landed and invaded the Marshall Islands on February 1st, and taking advantage of its momentum, it has continued to attack Truk Island, an important Japanese base in the South Pacific. Disregarding the heavy damage it suffered since the enemy landed on Mono Island in October of last year in northern New Guinea, Bougainville, New Britain, Rabaul, etc., it single-mindedly continues its forceful operational goal, which is to attack Truk Islands, a strategic base in the South Pacific. However, due to the strong counter-offensive force of the Japanese army in that area, it has suffered great losses, and the battle situation has not progressed. Therefore, it has been eager to avoid frontal attacks and has gradually invaded Truk Islands from the Central Pacific, first attacking the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands, where the Japanese army's defense capabilities are weaker. And with its remaining strength, on the 17th, it invaded Truk Islands with powerful aircraft units and powerful air force units. Currently, both sides are engaged in fierce fighting. According to reports, the enemy's attack this time is by no means a formal operation, but merely a reconnaissance battle. However, with Japan's strong navy, fighting against an enemy that has difficulties with supplies and a long distance to attack, it will undoubtedly repel them.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Wewak: Five Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific on the 18th: Anti-Axis aircraft once again raided Wewak, New Guinea on the 15th. On that day, at approximately 8:00 AM, approximately sixty enemy P40 and P47 aircraft attacked Japanese ships at sea north of Wewak. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately launched a courageous counterattack, engaging in a fierce aerial battle and shooting down five P40s. The others were all repelled. Although Japanese aircraft lost three, the convoy suffered no damage. Also, at 5:30 AM on the same day, another unit of Japanese aircraft bombed an enemy airfield under construction southwest of Wewak, inflicting great damage.</p>
<h3>Swedish Minister to Japan Arrives in Tokyo from Thailand</h3>

The resolution was passed. The Health Department proposed that a Huaibei Provincial School Health Committee should be established jointly with the Education Department to facilitate the promotion of school health work in various cities and counties of the province. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the expansion of the circulation of Huaibei Provincial Reserve Certificates, the Japanese authorities are also actively cooperating and have set the following measures: Regarding the use of reserve certificates for fees collected by public utility companies: (A) The system of collecting reserve certificates should be implemented as soon as possible. (B) The prices of items marked in Federal Reserve Notes should be converted according to the following exchange rate: 18 Federal Reserve Notes are equivalent to 100 Reserve Certificates. Also, the remainder of the amount collected should be rounded to the nearest 5 Reserve Certificate cents. Amounts less than 5 cents should be rounded down to 0 or up to 5. National policy companies and Japanese companies should use reserve certificates for salaries and material expenses: (A) For the salaries of Japanese personnel, one-third of the salary should be paid in reserve certificates initially, and then the full amount of the salary should be paid in reserve certificates as soon as possible.

<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Vice Consul Obata from Bangkok, who had previously returned to his country to report on his duties, recently arrived here on his way back to his post after completing his business. He met with reporters on the 17th and discussed the recent trends of overseas Chinese in Thailand as follows: There are 6 million overseas Chinese in Thailand. They, like overseas Chinese in other southern regions, occupy an absolute force. They completely dominate the economic power of Thailand in terms of production and distribution. Since the founding of the Republic of China, problems have repeatedly arisen between Thailand and overseas Chinese. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have realized that Asian nations should unite. Therefore, their subsequent relationship has been extremely harmonious. They have gradually understood the true meaning of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so they actively cooperate in all construction departments. In particular, they have made great contributions to the construction of railways. Furthermore, due to Thailand's active cooperation, Japan has given Thai overseas Chinese extremely great reflections and self-awareness.</p>

<h3>National Financial Revenue and Expenditure Now Maintain Balance; Recent Sharp Rise in Prices Unrelated to Currency</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held its regular meeting with Chinese and foreign journalists in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Responsible persons from the ministry answered various financial questions raised by the journalists in detail. The details are recorded below: What is the situation of national financial revenue and expenditure recently? (Answer) At present, the national financial revenue is mainly based on unified taxes, followed by customs duties, income tax, and salt tax. The monthly expenditure budget is approximately 300 million yuan, of which military expenses account for more than 60%. The revenue and expenditure can still be met. After the ban on opium, a batch of tax revenue will be reduced. How will this reduction be compensated? (Answer) The decision to ban opium within a limited time is indeed a gratifying thing. It has no impact on the entire tax revenue, and in fact, it was not originally intended to be used as a proper source of income, so there is no need to consider how to make up for it. After the Japanese residents in China pay taxes to the National Government in accordance with the regulations, how much will the tax revenue of the National Government increase? (Answer) There are currently no accurate statistics on the number of Japanese residents taxed, and the estimated number is not very large. However, this spirit of Japanese residents is indeed valuable and enough to symbolize the bright future of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The recent surge in prices in various places has many causes, but is it also stimulating the issuance of currency? (Answer) The amount of Central Reserve Certificates issued now has increased in quantity compared to before, but in terms of actual demand, it has not yet reached the saturation point at all. The issuance of banknotes during wartime is also a common phenomenon, so our country's current currency is not in inflation at all. In other words, the recent surge in prices has nothing to do with currency, but is only caused by the failure of material circulation to be smooth. To what extent has the Ministry of Finance's work on adjusting financial institutions progressed? There seem to be too many existing financial institutions. Is the authorities considering forcibly merging them? (Answer) The Ministry of Finance is still promoting and advancing the work of adjusting financial institutions according to the established policy. If there are those who do not increase the statutory funds as scheduled according to the regulations, they will be shut down. As for the forced merger of financial institutions, it may be implemented in the future due to changes in the environment, but it has not yet been considered at present.</p>
<h3>Price Management in Three Provinces and Two Cities Will Be Comprehensively Unified and Implemented</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Nanjing authorities believe that in order to solve the current serious price problem reasonably, it will not be successful without the overall planning and cooperation of all provinces, cities, and districts. In the past, price countermeasures in various provinces, cities, counties, and districts were individually formulated and implemented. There was little coordination and adjustment among them, resulting in large differences in prices in various places, leading to an uneven distribution of materials. As a result, it further promoted the surge in prices. For this reason, the authorities recently submitted a request to the central government to plan to organize a "Price Control Committee for Three Provinces and Two Cities" (tentative name) so that the price problems of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Nanjing and Shanghai special municipalities can have a fundamental and reasonable countermeasure and be comprehensively unified and implemented. The project is currently being closely reviewed by the Ministry of Industry. If it can be realized, the price problem can be reasonably solved. In addition, based on the above suggestions, the Ministry of Industry authorities have recently formulated official prices and agreed prices for daily food and necessities of life. The list of materials totals 17 items, which are circulated to the economic authorities of various provinces and cities, which in turn order the industry associations to strictly supervise and enforce them.</p>
<h3>Five Enemy Properties to Be Transferred Soon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - 1,534 pieces of enemy property belonging to British and American entities in China, North China (including Mengjiang), Hankou, Xiamen, Guangdong, and other regions have been investigated. Since February 8th of last year, the Japanese side has notified the transfer to the National Government in three batches, of which 1,481 pieces have been implemented. The remaining 43 pieces are currently being prepared by relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies for transfer. The Japanese government has long decided on its policy of transferring 25 pieces of enemy property other than the aforementioned British and American properties to the National Government, and has completed the investigation, which will be transferred soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Takes Over Pangshan Lake Farm</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Pangshan Lake Farm in Wujiang County was originally an experimental area for farmland irrigation and was quite large in scale. After the Incident, it was managed and operated by the Allied military. Last year, the Ministry of Food contacted the relevant parties several times, and the farm has been taken over by the Ministry of Food.</p>
<h3>Rommel Inspects the Atlantic Wall and Talks with Commanders of Various Districts</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency has been authorized to publish: Marshal Rommel, by order of Marshal Xi Shi Quan Yin, recently inspected the southern part of the Atlantic Wall in order to inspect the fortresses and defense systems there. After inspecting the defenses in the Gulf of Lyon, Marshal Rommel traveled along the Pyrenees Mountains to the southernmost part of the German Western Front near the border between France and Spain, Handa and Irun. The Marshal also inspected the German deep-sealed defensive points along the Atlantic coast in Biscay, paying particular attention to places of special military importance, such as the ports of southwestern France. After inspecting the coastal heavy artillery units and various bases along the Atlantic coast, Marshal Rommel was convinced of the technical effectiveness of these facilities and the excellent training of the defending forces. Marshal Rommel held lengthy talks with the commanders of various districts and discussed future tasks with them. After this inspection, this part of the Atlantic Wall proved that the Biscay coast was ready to repel any enemy attack.</p>
<h3>It is Reported that Finland Rejected Soviet Demands; German Troops in Finland Will Not Withdraw</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports; local newspapers recently published a statement by a "Soviet government spokesman" stationed in Stockholm, who said that the future of the Soviet-Finnish issue is not promising. He claimed that all published peace terms were inaccurate. He acknowledged that the Soviet Union would demand that Finland force the withdrawal of German troops from Finland and the occupation by Soviet troops, but the Finnish side has expressed its refusal to accept, so it is currently impossible to coordinate the two sides.</p>
<p>Also, according to announcements from Berlin political circles: General Detit (the commander of German troops in northern Norway and Finland) has been ordered to prepare for withdrawal, which is part of the enemy's psychological warfare.</p>
<h3>The War Has Entered a Decisive Stage; The Fate of the European Continent is at Stake; Dr. Goebbels Appeals Loudly</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitian News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the German Weekly that the war has approached its peak. Since the beginning of 1944, there have been decisive and major developments in both military and political aspects. The struggle that will determine the history and fate of Europe is increasingly close. If the enemy can defeat Germany, the collapse of Europe is inevitable. At this critical juncture of life and death, we must exert our last ounce of strength, otherwise the people of Huan Lu will eventually be trapped in a state of terror forever. The people of Europe know that if they want to avoid disaster, they can only rely on Germany and cannot seek help from Britain and the United States. The goals of Britain and the United States also disappear with the progress of the war, because Britain and the United States can no longer restore Europe to its pre-war position, but can only pave the way for the Communists to rule Europe. Since Britain and the United States are no longer able to do anything, only the German military can stop the Bolsheviks from occupying Europe. The Soviet Union is now using its propaganda to deceive the world, and the Jews are widely supporting it, using it to cover up the world's reason and act as traitors, which is infuriating.</p>
<h3>One U.S. Ship Sunk, Thousands Drowned</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington; the U.S. Army Department announced on the 17th that a U.S. transport ship was sunk by German forces in European waters at night. Due to the rough seas at the time, the ship sank immediately. Approximately 1,000 crew members and soldiers drowned, and the remaining 1,000 were rescued. However, the location and date of the sinking were not announced.</p>
<h3>Soviet Winter Offensive Ends; German Troops Shorten Lines in the North</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: In the northern sector of the Eastern Front, a cold wave with temperatures around 15 degrees below zero has extended to areas north of the Dnipro River bend. Roads have frozen, and snowfall is occurring everywhere, with only the Crimean Peninsula reporting rainfall.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, military dispatch: Germany is implementing a planned shortening of its lines to gain more reserve operational units. Therefore, after destroying all military equipment last night, it withdrew from Staraya Russa (south of Lake Ilmen). The German forces stationed there were able to disengage from the enemy, and all military equipment and supplies were transported to newly prepared positions. The Soviet forces were unable to hinder the German movements.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - A German military spokesman announced yesterday: The battles on the Eastern Front in the last few days have been less intense than two weeks ago. German forces are now conducting counter-offensives in the southern sector. The Soviet winter offensive, which began on December 24th of last year, has now ended. Most of the locations of intense fighting two weeks ago are now quiet. The main focus of the fighting across the entire front is currently only in two areas. The German counter-offensive west of Cherkasy, although encountering stubborn Soviet resistance, continues to make daily progress. The other focus is near Vitebsk, where German forces repelled a full-scale Soviet attack. Currently, Soviet forces continue to threaten the Narva region, but the Soviet offensive in that area cannot be described as a large-scale attack. The Soviet operations directed at Pskov have encountered obstacles and stalled.</p>
<h3>Naturno Landing Zone Further Compressed; German Troops Firmly Hold Cassino</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: German forces have launched several fierce attacks on enemy positions in the Naturno bridgehead. As a result, German positions were improved on Wednesday, and the Allied landing zone was further narrowed. The enemy troop concentrations in the bridgehead have been subjected to intense artillery fire and air attacks, suffering heavy losses. In the Cassino area, American forces continue to shell the Benedictine monastery, but there is no news of other fighting. Although the enemy has repeatedly attempted to advance from the northern suburbs of Cassino, these attempts have collapsed under German artillery fire.</p>
<p>Condemnation of Monastery Bombing as Barbaric Act</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Field Marshal Kesselring, German commander on the Italian Front, issued a statement: On February 15th, from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM, Allied air forces bombed the monastery atop Monte Cassino, completely destroying the monastery and causing many civilian deaths and injuries. The Allied Command claimed that the attack was carried out to eliminate German forces inside the monastery, but I categorically deny this. Months ago, the Vatican, through the German Embassy, requested that the Cassino monastery be excluded from the war zone. Consequently, I immediately took the necessary measures, strictly prohibiting German troops from entering the monastery. We did not even use the monastery to house the seriously wounded. At the time of the bombing, hundreds of refugees, believing in the monastery's neutrality, had sought shelter there. There were no German troops in its vicinity. Those killed and injured in the bombing were only monks and civilians. The fact that there were no German troops or military installations inside the monastery can be proven by a signed declaration from Abbot Diamare. After the monastery was destroyed, German forces immediately designated it as part of the German defensive line, which was a natural measure. The Allied forces also bombed the Pope's summer residence, killing 500 Italian civilians, including 16 nuns. No German troops had ever entered that area, and German forces strictly adhered to its extraterritoriality. As the German commander in Italy, I hereby point out that the American action is new evidence of the destruction of European culture by the British, Americans, and Soviets. I am extremely disgusted by the shameless attempt of the British and American war leadership to shift the responsibility for destroying the monastery onto the German forces.</p>
<h3>Argentine Coup d'état Creates a Great Shock</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Argentine coup d'état appears to have caused a great shock in American political circles. According to United Press in Washington: U.S. State Department officials have expressed the view that if a pro-Nazi group of officers seizes power after this Argentine coup, the U.S. government will observe the development of the situation and not recognize the Argentine government. However, Argentine political circles are currently extremely chaotic, and it is now only possible to wait and see how the political situation develops.</p>
<h3>The Path to Permanent Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhenxiu</p>
<p>Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the Japanese Army gave a speech (original text can be found in the 17th and 18th editions of Japanese newspapers - Editor's note), stating that Japan can only avoid defeat by obtaining China's genuine cooperation and hoping that the Japanese in Shanghai will strive to thoroughly implement the new policy. This speech has had an impact on various aspects of Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides who are advancing and accepting the new policy are determined to move towards resolving the Sino-Japanese problem in accordance with the spirit of the policy. Mr. Wu Zhenxiu, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, a financial magnate in Shanghai, also responded to Colonel Tsuji's speech. Based on the spirit of the new policy, he pointed out the necessity of assisting Japan in building the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation, expressed the attitude of Chinese economic circles, and frankly expressed various opinions regarding China's economic construction. The following is a summary of his key points:</p>
<p>The Goal of Greater East Asia Construction</p>
<p>In this Japanese parliament, the goal of constructing a new economic order for Greater East Asia has been declared as mutual benefit, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity for all countries in Greater East Asia. Building a new order of coexistence and co-prosperity using the old Anglo-American methods is impossible. The prior issue is to create a Greater East Asia economic organization that reasonably distributes raw materials, production power, its equipment, and products. This means gathering representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia to hold a meeting that can be called the Greater East Asia Economic Conference.  Focusing on the distribution of raw materials, production power, and products, establish a planned economy for all of East Asia.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the outbreaks of the First and Second World Wars in Europe, the existing Anglo-American economic system will cause wars again. This is as clear as fire. Finance Minister Kaya stated in parliament that there was no intention to restore the gold standard, which is certainly appropriate. Establishing this planned economy seems suitable to adopt a system that controls the countries of Greater East Asia. Applying this method to China means adjusting the Sino-Japanese economy.</p>
<p>I often think that there are many Chinese people who are pro-Japanese now but were anti-Japanese in the past, changing their beliefs due to the changing times. The same situation exists in Japan. It is difficult to fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese problem with such people. Regardless of the past or present, without being moved by the environment, quietly observe and examine the fundamental problems between China and Japan, and not be dominated by the changes of the times to solve the problems between China and Japan, these are the people who I think can truly resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. These people are the ones who are making the greatest efforts for the future coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan. Among the Chinese, there are many such people who do not come forward. It can be said that these people are sincerely waiting for the day they can work for China and Japan.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying called "Each goes his own way," which means each marches toward their own beliefs. The opposite of this is "Each goes the wrong way."</p>
<p>Concrete Implementation of the New Policy</p>
<p>Recently, there are indeed commendable and increasing cases of the gradual concrete implementation of the new policy in state-owned enterprises, the disposal of enemy property, the control of materials, and other aspects. This is showing Japan's sincerity to the Chinese, and the number of people who trust Japan is increasing. However, observing the dynamics of the past year, although the people above are good, if the people below do not fully understand this spirit, the result is that these good deeds cannot blossom and bear fruit below. Isn't this somewhat visible in the new policy?</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani, Minister Tajiri, and Colonel Tsuji have also clearly stated that this consistency is the key to the concrete implementation of the new policy. Of course, the Chinese who are affected by the new policy should also correct their past attitudes, be aware that they are East Asians, and continue to work harder than ever before to cooperate with Japan. I dare say that this point should be fully remembered by people in Chinese economic circles.</p>
<p>China's Autonomy</p>
<p>The foundation of the new policy lies in China's autonomy. What is meant by autonomy? This means leaving China to carry out its responsibilities and creativity independently. This is especially so in politics, economics, and culture, especially economics. Of course, Japan's economy is different from China's feudal economy and has been modernized. Therefore, what China cannot start should be done by Japan, while what China can do, it is hoped that it will be entirely handled by China.</p>
<p>I often say that the division of activities between Chinese and Japanese capital is clear. For example, China's existing capital, technology, and production equipment in heavy industries, chemical industries, etc., cannot be compared to Japan's, so Japanese economics must do it. But in terms of procurement and light industry, isn't it a good method to assist Chinese activity? Thinking from the perspective of Sino-Japanese cooperation, it is very difficult to achieve satisfactory progress if both sides are equal and do the same thing. Mr. Kodama, the former president of the Central China Development Company, said that even if capital can cooperate, people's cooperation is not possible. This seems to be the case.</p>
<p>The New Policy and North China</p>
<p>The new policy can also be implemented in North China. But observing the facts, it is rich in Central China flavor. What I just said, I think it is the same in North China.</p>
<p>The unification of Chinese capital is necessary in making economic activities modernized. We must strive towards unifying Chinese capital, which is the same as before. Regarding this point, fostering national capital is most important, and there is no other way to do this except by fostering national capital by Japan based on the new policy.</p>
<p>The Scope of the New Policy</p>
<p>Among the Japanese, once the new policy is established and reaches the stage of implementation, people are declaring, "This is the new policy," and "That is the new policy," and there is a tendency to start all kinds of things at the same time. However, the superficial structure changes too much. The exterior is the new policy, but isn't the content contrary to its spirit? I think this point should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>For example, in Central and North China, the currency is complex, and the controlling authorities are different. If they are unified while shouting the new policy, the impact of economic changes in the two places will be very large. When the stability of people's livelihood is still needed, changes in the economic world can have negative consequences. If there are such problems, then it can only be hoped that they can be gradually or fundamentally adjusted without changes under the current conditions.</p>
<p>The Problem of Material Exchange</p>
<p>The exchange of materials is one of my greatest considerations. Under the current conditions, there are more obstacles to material exchange. There are two fundamental problems in controlling materials, namely, first, preventing materials from being washed out to enemy areas, and second, controlling the materials to ensure a certain amount of military supplies. The previous easing of restrictions on the movement of 19 controlled items was to remove things that did not need to be controlled. But there are still 17 controlled items, but their control is implemented to achieve the aforementioned goals.</p>
<p>However, if there is a method to ensure military supplies, then the control of some items can be eased somewhat. This is not my individual thought, but a general view. Reviewing this point again, I think it is necessary to adopt a mechanism that enables the exchange of materials. The problem with the Commerce and Trade Association lies in the method of controlling materials, that is, whether it is still concentrated in the Commerce and Trade Association, or whether important materials are controlled separately. However, no matter which method of control is used, strengthening the mechanism is always necessary.</p>
<p>The Activities of Chinese Economic Circles</p>
<p>Among people in economic circles, the number of people who are willing to cooperate has certainly increased, but there are still many who take a neutral position, and there are also those who are always only interested in profit. It is said that among those who express a particularly cooperative attitude, many are seeking rights and interests. On the other hand, among those who do not come forward, there are many who are seriously thinking about the permanent future of China and Japan. Assigning leadership to these people and implementing economic policies that promote the overall will of the people, I think, is very important and urgent.</p>
<p>I have simply stated one aspect of what I believe. I am deeply impressed by what Colonel Tsuji, Ambassador Tani, and Minister Tajiri have said. In particular, Colonel Tsuji's radio broadcast speech on the 8th is deeply engraved in my mind. Its content is indeed the true voice of Japan. It is also the voice of the new China. There is a Chinese saying called "It is better to be quiet than to move." My mentality is also like this, and I am determined to work hard for the permanent peace of China and Japan.

<h3>Commerce and Trade Association Ordered to Handle Material Exchange and Distribution; Implementation Plan to Begin with Rice Procurement</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) In order to implement the current food and price policies, the authorities are paying attention to the distribution of cotton yarn and other major materials in various places, promoting the purchase of agricultural products, and aiming for organic operation. On January 30th, they promulgated the Outline for the Implementation of Material Distribution in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, ordering the Commerce and Trade Association to be responsible for implementation. After receiving the order, the Commerce and Trade Association immediately made close plans. The initial implementation plan will first begin with the Rice Control Association's purchase of rice. The method is that when purchasing rice, in addition to paying a portion of the funds directly to farmers in cash, a small portion of the remainder will be paid with material distribution certificates from local cooperatives. The cooperatives will then distribute daily necessities needed by farmers with these certificates. The materials distributed include six types: cotton yarn, candles, matches, soap, sugar, and cigarettes. This method has been approved at the 11th meeting of the Material Control Examination Committee of the Executive Yuan and will be implemented soon. The detailed table for the exchange of materials will be based on the quantity and amount of rice purchased in various places. It is believed that the implementation of this method will make the rice purchasing work smoother, and the general price level will also tend to stabilize as a result.</p>
<h3>Chief of Reporting Department Matsushima Refutes American False Propaganda; Issues Statement on Situation in Marshall Islands</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Yesterday, the Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet, Matsushima, met with the Shanghai Chinese press corps and issued a statement on the situation in the Marshall Islands, refuting the enemy's false propaganda. He pointed out that America's desire to use the Chinese mainland to attack the Japanese mainland is a fantasy. He also stated that Japan is currently adopting a posture of preparedness and will soon launch a large-scale counter-offensive, currently in offensive defense. As for America's desire to use China as a tragic battlefield, attempting to seek its own survival with the blood and flesh of others, it is a consistent Anglo-American conspiracy, etc. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>District Court Clears Backlog of Cases; Holds Talk Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Since the Shanghai District Court was reorganized and established after merging the former First and Second Special District Courts and the Nanshi District Court, its jurisdiction has expanded, and the number of civil and criminal litigation cases accepted has also increased, reaching more than 2,000 cases per month. President Zhao, formerly the presiding judge of the First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, has spared no effort in reorganizing the court's internal affairs since being transferred to this position. He is especially concerned about the suffering of the people in litigation. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, he separately convened meetings with the presiding judges and judges of the civil and criminal divisions to discuss the issue of clearing the backlog of cases. He earnestly urged them to expedite the handling of the backlog of cases within the shortest possible time, in order to alleviate the suffering of litigants. In the future, cases should be accepted and handled as soon as they arrive, and be concluded as soon as they are handled, in order to live up to Minister Zhang's expectations for reorganizing the judiciary.</p>

<h3>Fellow Members of the Baizhi Scholarship Fund Continue to Benefit the Impoverished; This Year's University Scholarship Donation Exceeds 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Baizhi Scholarship Fund Committee is organized by fellow members of the Chinese medicine community. When this newspaper handled the scholarship fund last year, the committee allocated certain extracurricular income to establish a scholarship fund for impoverished university students, setting up 20 places for freshmen. This newspaper recommended these students, and the total amount of their tuition fees for this semester, approved by this newspaper, was 34,500 yuan, which was still funded by the committee. All of it was granted yesterday. The main condition of this scholarship is the student's poor family background. If academic performance is excellent, the student can continue to receive the scholarship until graduation. This virtue of cultivating talent for the country and supporting the impoverished is worthy of social emulation.</p>

<h3>Third Phase of Household Coal Briquettes Ready; Sales to Start Universally Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the distribution of the 21st phase of household coal briquettes in the jurisdiction of the First District Public Office, the competent authorities have prepared everything and will soon issue a notice to begin sales universally within days. As for the quantity allocated per person and the price, it is said to be the same as in the previous phase. It is understood that various coal briquette manufacturing plants are already starting production to meet the needs of various sales agents. According to a Shanghai News reporter's inquiry from the coal industry, the raw materials (coal dust) used to manufacture coal briquettes are still arriving continuously. Considering the current quantity of household coal briquettes distributed, there will definitely be no shortage of fuel needed by residents for cooking. It is also understood that the coal ash sold by members of the Municipal Coal Slag Dealers' Association is very suitable for manufacturing coal briquettes. Therefore, the association is working to adjust the price of coal ash and strictly prohibits selling it to hoarders.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Conference of Economic Bureau Directors</h3>
<p>In a recent editorial, this newspaper, under the title "Sound Personnel and Unified Wartime Authority," discussed the prerequisites for the success of rice control, but we felt that the joint meeting of cadres convened by the Rice Control Committee was merely a superficial formality, no different from ordinary meetings. The result was simply the implementation of motions and reports. This has become a common ailment of all meetings in the country and must be eradicated fundamentally. Only then can the name of the meeting match the reality of the meeting? Otherwise, even if there is a meeting, discussion, and resolution, the result will only be a resolution that is not implemented.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, concerned about the rising prices in various regions, even several price increases in a single day, causing public anxiety and uncertainty, convened a conference of provincial and municipal economic bureau directors in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month to discuss countermeasures, seek reasonable solutions, and stabilize people's livelihoods. It urgently sought to suppress the price increases, strive for an ample supply of materials, and instruct the relevant authorities to earnestly implement the temporary wartime price management regulations, so that ordinary merchants would not regard them as mere empty words. This seems to be the motivation for convening this meeting. So, can this "Economic Bureau Directors Conference" become an effective prescription for the most serious price problems at the moment?</p>
<p>Indeed, the Economic Bureau is responsible for stabilizing prices, but there are fundamental methods and general methods for stabilizing prices. We feel that the severity and urgency of the current price situation is already a case of "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." Therefore, for the immediate future, we must actively implement general methods for stabilizing prices, the most important of which are: 1. Price freezing, i.e., taking the average price of general commodities on a certain day as the highest price, and not allowing it to exceed this price and continue to rise; 2. Crack down on profiteering, i.e., severely punish merchants who take the opportunity to raise prices to seek exorbitant profits; 3. Manage sales, i.e., strictly manage the sales of daily necessities to regulate supply and demand. As for cracking down on hoarding and speculation, it can be included in cracking down on profiteering and managing sales.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Food Prices Must Be Submitted to the Review Council - Municipal Grain Bureau Informs Food Industry Guilds</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in this city previously assessed and set standard price limits for goods in installments and issued them to all members of the industry for compliance. However, to this day, many businesses have arbitrarily changed prices and deliberately exceeded these limits, causing great harm to the people's livelihood. The Municipal Grain Bureau, to prevent illegal price increases and curb the rising tide of prices, has specifically ordered all grain industry trade associations to submit any future price adjustments to the Price Assessment Committee for approval before implementation. Unauthorized price increases are strictly prohibited, and those who deliberately violate the regulations will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Will Reregister Unregistered Companies</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry began handling company registrations last October, it has instructed the relevant authorities to handle them separately. Companies with legal organizations that applied for registration have been approved by the Ministry and issued registration licenses. However, some companies whose organizations did not meet the requirements of the company regulations were rejected by the Ministry. To ease the difficulties of businesses and prevent mail from being lost or misdirected, the Ministry has decided that all companies in various regions, whether applying directly or indirectly through the Economic Bureau, that have not been approved for registration must, by the end of this month, state the reason for the case and the company's detailed name and address in a registered letter to the Ministry for verification.</p>

<h3>Farmers' Urgent Plea: Grain Receipts Impossible to Calculate</h3>
<p>— Geng Qing</p>
<p>The collection of land tax relies entirely on the grain receipts issued by the county. The grain receipts of Qingpu County are now like this: First, the name of the grain taxpayer is indicated, then the amount of mu (unit of land) that the grain taxpayer should pay, and then the fertility of the land, such as first-class top, first-class middle, and first-class bottom, are each specified, and the amount of legal tender to be paid is then indicated. However, the class to which the paid land belongs is not indicated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the grain taxpayers cannot calculate the amount after reading the grain receipts. Only when paying at the counter, the clerk standing inside the counter will temporarily indicate which class your land belongs to. Is it easy to multiply and calculate the amount after it is indicated? Still not. The clerk standing inside the counter will still arbitrarily add how much surtax per mu and how much survey fee per mu. The grain taxpayer standing outside the counter cannot use the abacus inside the counter to calculate the amount, so they have to let the clerk do the calculations as they please. Once the amount is calculated, you have no choice but to obediently pay the legal tender earned with your sweat and blood.</p>
<p>This is not the only strange thing. After paying the legal tender, he actually gives you a receipt. This receipt only states how many mu have been paid, but it never states how much legal tender has been received! We hope that the county government will earnestly rectify this situation and not allow the villagers to have grievances that they cannot express!</p>
<h3>Extortion and Apportionment</h3>
<p>— Jin Limin</p>
<p>In recent years, the practice of township and bao leaders extorting donations from residents in the countryside has become increasingly rampant and endless. The method of apportioning donations by township and bao leaders in my hometown (i.e., Jianxiang Township, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang) is as follows: The township chief actually issues orders, gathers all the bao leaders for a meeting, and must first slaughter pigs and chickens to set up a feast to entertain them. The bao chief is assigned a huge amount of money and is given a deadline to collect and hand it over to the execution leader. They extort from house to house, regardless of wealth, with rich families paying seven or eight hundred yuan per month and poor families paying several hundred yuan. In addition, when collecting spring flowers from farmland, they apportion seven or eight sheng (unit of volume) of soybeans and wheat per mu. During the autumn harvest, they extort three dou (unit of volume) of rice per mu. In addition, there are items such as wealthy donations and special donations. They forcibly assign each household to pay, and the township chiefs, bao leaders, and jia leaders who are in charge are all local unemployed idlers who push each other forward and use their power to bully others. Therefore, those with a little agricultural land value are afraid of trouble and endure in silence, and are unwilling to come forward to assume the duties of township and bao leaders. As a result, things are getting worse and worse, society is moving towards darkness, and the people are in dire straits. It is hoped that the provincial and county governments will quickly send personnel to thoroughly investigate and vigorously reform the local organizational structure to alleviate the suffering of the people and resolve the crisis. I would be extremely fortunate!</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>I greatly admire Mr. Tang Jingguo's article in the National Forum some time ago, which proposed the method of paying teachers' salaries once every six months or paying half in advance. I have learned that Mingde Girls' Middle School on Taishan Road has adopted this method since last semester in order to take care of its colleagues, and will continue to implement it this semester. The method is as follows: 1. Three months' salary will be paid in advance on February 7; 2. Half a month's salary will be paid on March 7 and March 31; 3. Half a month's salary will be paid on May 7 and June 7; 4. One month's salary will be paid on July 7; 5. Salary increases will be sent separately each month. (Xu Shigong)</p>
<h3>Sea Turtle (5)</h3>
<p>— Written by Hidetoyo Umitada, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>The five-minute game time. Unfortunately, the even-numbered team of Real Person lost because the bar was pushed at an angle of more than thirty degrees, and the decision was that it lost.</p>
<p>However, the most ridiculous thing is that when the speaker before that time stopped - "the speaker sounded, the postures of the two armies, at the moment when it stopped until five minutes, the speaker sounded, so I had to immediately stop the competitive action, and the military order was like a god - the students who were beating were still in the same posture, and the students who were beaten were also in the same posture. So, from the whole point of view, it was like the previously washed live-action race (Note: Living people are dressed up as characters in the game). Otherwise, it was like a movie had a problem. To the third party, it was very funny - but the students did it with caution - so both sides were silent. Usually three battles are the rule, so both sides returned to the designated place, at that time, they began to reorganize in their own camp. No one likes to take a defensive position around the pole. Even if they are beaten and kicked, they cannot fight back, which is something that everyone feels uncomfortable. This time, Real Person was also involved in the attack. Perhaps because his jujutsu was praised.</p>
<p>-You are number four - so let's fight - so it's okay to follow at the end."</p>
<p>Another member of the platoon, number two, said this to Real Person in a friendly way. That student's surname was Tang Qian, a core member of the attack known for swordsmanship.</p>
<p>- Real Person understood Tang Qian's friendship, but he was not satisfied with being sent to the end.</p>
<p>Because in the first battle, he was punched and kicked, and the uneasiness in his chest not only did not stop, but the fighting spirit surged back. One... Real Person couldn't help but let out the roar of a Mormon fighting. The feet stepping on the grass. Bouncing like a ball. When the second battle started, Tang Qian stood in front, and the members of the jujutsu club, Xintian, and others, began to fight with the enemy's guerrillas. Real Person could no longer bear it, and decided to charge into the enemy's formation, and began to run from the side of the team to the front.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he took a hammer, knocked the enemy down at that time, and ran forward again, and he had reached the enemy's front. Jumping on the back of the outer formation, a strong impact knocked them to the ground. Five large legs were approaching in front of his nose. He immediately decided to dive into this gap between the legs. There were no eyes on the legs, so the enemies kept kicking each other. It goes without saying that Real Person's face and back were cruelly trampled on. On the other side of the towering legs, he found the root of the pole's base. Grabbing the pole, he desperately tugged with both hands, and then it seemed like in a dream!</p>
<p>As a result, the second battle resulted in a complete victory for Real Person's army. After the end of the last battle, which was also judged to be a defeat, when going to the bathhouse, there were some with bleeding noses, and some with bruises on their faces, but there was no distinction between enemy and friend. The shouting in the bathhouse seemed like the walls were about to collapse. One person started laughing loudly, and suddenly everyone was swept into the vortex of laughter again. -Gu, that guy, is a sea turtle after all. He went down today and made a great contribution."

<h3>Save Fuel for Cooking: Invention of the Insulation Box</h3>
<p>The method of saving fuel for cooking published by Mr. Dai Yanping in this newspaper on the 13th of this month is very much in line with scientific principles. I have studied it in detail and have made dozens of them, named Insulation Boxes. All the functions are more than what Mr. Yanping mentioned. It can save more than 20% of coal briquettes per month, and the cost is about 400 yuan. For details, please send a letter to 424 Hede Road, and I will send a free brochure. (Li Hanchu)</p>
