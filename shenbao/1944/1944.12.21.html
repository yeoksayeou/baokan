<h3>訪日任務已完畢陳院長返抵首都　　與盟邦當憶懇談結果圓滿</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　宣傳部於今日下午四時發表公報：國府行政院院長本月十四日出國訪問日本，對緊密協力完遂戰爭諸問題，迭與盟邦常局懇談極爲圓滿，業於十九日離東京，二十日下午二時五十分返抵首都，國府周副院長等軍政長官數十人均往機塲恭迎，隨陳院長訪日諸大員，除外交部長褚民誼氏奉派轉赴名古屋，親詣汪主席易　之醫院寢室致敬，對盟邦官民及醫生致謝，並參加當地舉行之追悼會，其餘蕭院長。林部長。周秘書畏等，均隨同陳院長返京。玆誌陳院長返國談話如次：</p>
<h3>以同甘共苦决心與盟邦緊密提携　陳院長勗勉全國民衆</h3>
<p>「余此次訪日，承小磯總理大臣·及諸大臣閣下·暨日本國民諸君熱誠相處，迭與盟邦當軸諸公披誠懇談，交換意見，篤摯融洽，無異疇昔，實深感慰。以盟邦當局對中國提携之殷，援助之誠，日增不已，此後兩國協力益形緊密，固下待言，而國民政府之强化領導全國民衆向獨立自主之目標邁進，更當有無限之期待。</p>
<p>盟邦民氣淬勵奮發</p>
<p>滯留期間雖甚短促，然所見所聞，盟邦朝野對完遂大東亞戰爭決心之堅定不拔，精神之激勵昂揚，敵機屢炸曾不足以損其毫末，惟便民意民氣愈益振發，而生產之加速進展，軍需之倍增充實，勞動之勤奮，投軍之踴躍，一種熱烈之氣氛，較前更爲緊張，尤令人欽佩無似。</p>
<p>推行國策此志不渝</p>
<p>於此有願披瀝誠意，咪盟邦朝野人士吿，爲我國同胞勗者，促進和平·聯結日本·安定東亞·爲國民政府還都之使命，協刀戰爭·團結束亞·摧擊美英·爲參戰的中國當前之責任，此皆汪主席未完之國策。汪主席雖不及見和平統一之完成，戰爭之完遂，然其愛中國愛東亞之精　，永在領導吾人繼續奮鬥，國民政府暨國民全體經茲鉅痛，感時局之嚴重，益凜責任之艱鉅，誓必完成遺志，決不稍渝。</p>
<p>排隊萬難促進和平</p>
<p>目前最要之圖，一爲加强協力決戰之態勢，粉碎暴敵再侵東亞之殘餘勢力，一爲排除萬難，完成中國之統一，促進全面之和平。由前者言，盟邦旣舉其國力，擔當前鋒屛障，東亞中國自常倍加戰力，鞏固後衛，供應前方。由後者言，英美猙獰面目日益暴露，即在渝方亦終不能不漸覺依存英美之非計，而肓目濫炸，肆意焦土，尤爲全國民衆所同深憤槪者。吾人於此，惟有一面努力國民政府自身之强化，俾能負荷解決時局之重託，一面以最大之誠意，實踐中日同盟條約，信守大東亞共同宣言，以樹立正義和平之階梯。</p>
<p>强化國府協力戰爭</p>
<p>協力戰爭之道，如肅正思想·如確保治安·如增加生產，凡所以供應軍需·安定民生·有利作戰者，皆當唯力是視。强化國民政府之道，如建軍·如組訓民衆·如樹立廉潔政治，凡所以培養民力·厚集國力·鞏固邦基者，皆當積極從事，而茲二者又必須相輔而行，不容稍有偏廢。總之，大東亞戰爭巳臨決戰階段，同生共死，實歷史的命運之所注定，中國之自由平等，東亞之獨立解放，胥繫於此一戰。中國爲參戰國之一員，又爲東亞軸心之一柱，責任綦重。</p>
<p>堅守信念全力以赴</p>
<p>國民政府誓必本此信念，領導國民以同生共死之決心，與盟邦加緊提携，對戰爭加强協力，期貫澈和平運動之初衷，實踐同盟參戰之誓言，而毋負盟邦友好予我之誠意。關於國民政府戰時體制之種種建設，自必盡其在我全力以赴，盟邦政府及其國民信念，能本於同盟條約及共同宣言之精神爲更進一步之援助也。」</p>

<h3>歐戰現勢</h3>
<p>一九四四年又快過去了，反軸心方面預定年內必可結束的歐洲戰事，迄至目前仍僵持未下。英美的自大和輕視德國，顯已遭受巨大的打擊。</p>
<p>現時歐洲戰事，西綫方面的荷蘭境地及南綫義大利一帶似比較沉寂，凍綫波羅的海東岸及羅馬尼亞，保加利亞境內，則大致都已吿一段落。最劇烈的戰事，方集中於西綫比利時盧森堡，法國與德國的邊境，東綫洪牙利京城周圍及斯洛伐克東境。</p>
<p>西綫比利時中部與德國接境處的亞琛區，大戰一直進行未停，自亞琛沿德比邊境南下經瑪爾米台區至盧森堡東面特里爾以至薩爾，反軸心軍常企圖衝破齊格菲防綫，向德國西境萊因河地區推進，但始終爲强大的德國軍隊所阻止，即有進展，也極微小，反軸心軍實屬得不償失。又自薩爾地區薩爾勃魯根沿德邊境經薩爾格米納斯一帶，以至狹長西爾薩斯區域的西綫的南部戰綫，連日也在展開劇戰，這是反軸心軍企圖由德國西南國境進攻的路綫。</p>
<p>東綫方面，洪牙利京城布達佩斯現仍爲戰事重心，蘇軍曾衝入布達佩斯，現時雙方相持於布達佩斯之東北，戰事相當劇烈。布達佩斯之南多瑙河西面和普拉登湖東南之間，蘇軍似同樣採取强烈的攻勢。最近蘇軍同時又着目標於斯洛伐克，所以在斯洛伐克東境南境，也調集不少軍隊作戰。自洪境米斯科爾茲一帶至斯洛伐克科鍚斯一帶之綫，似尤爲蘇軍所重視。另外，斯洛伐克北面自波蘭境內維斯都拉河下來的蘇軍，以克拉科爲中心，蘇軍在斯洛伐克北面似也發動攻勢。目的在於由東南北三面夾擊斯洛伐克。</p>
<p>照目前情形看，歐洲戰事的最劇烈地區，西綫在以亞琛區爲中心的德比邊境，其次爲薩爾，亞爾薩斯一帶。東綫則以布達佩斯爲中心，展開於洪牙利西部及洪牙利和斯洛伐克間。</p>
<p>反軸心軍在東西兩戰綫，自夏季攻勢以至目前發動的冬季攻勢，所動員的兵力物力，確可說巨大無比，而其攻勢的劇烈，也實足以驚人；可是其所獲的成績，實在顯得太低劣。觀數月來西綫常膠住於德比法邊境，東綫的布達佩斯久攻難下，可以察知反軸心軍的損失，是遠在收穫之上。道幾天西綫德軍有由守勢轉爲攻勢的傾向，東綫布達佩斯德軍反擊蘇軍也獲成功，整個戰局對於德軍仍無不利之勢。</p>
<p>要之，反軸心軍的攻勢固凶，軸心軍的抗禦力更强。一般近視者在前次鑒於軸心軍一時的變更戰略，對於軸心國不論軍事方面經濟方面以至政洽方面，曾經估計得太低；但最近事實所昭示——數月來軸心軍抗禦力的堅强，當可給他們以淸楚的認識。無論如何，反軸心軍不管在軍事上或政治上，都是無法使德國屈服的。同時，反軸心陣營之間對歐洲問題解決的見解的矛盾，也是一天一天的明顯，所以我們對歐洲時局的觀察，是不能輕信反軸心方面的反宣傳的。</p>

<h3>雷伊泰島的殊死戰</h3>
<p>自從十月二十日敵美在雷伊泰島登陸以來，一閱月的彼此攻防戰，一天比一天地劇烈起來了。敵美用七師團的兵力，企圖擴大佔領區，而我們則源源不斷地派往前綫以新的精銳部隊，加以堵截。一部先遣部隊，業已在加里格拉灣沿岸，中央高地野羅，達格密區，粵爾摩克灣沿岸，以及達姆　綫，展開空前驚人的殊死戰。此外敵方殘餘部隊，又出現於菲律賓東方海面，而向我菲島重要區域施以轟炸。但我們陸海兩方的空軍，以驚天地泣鬼神的體撞戰術與以致命的打擊。敵我的大戰，自從大東亞戰爭開始以來，實可以說在陸海空三方面已到決一最後戰爭的階段了</p>
<p>粉碎敵人企圖</p>
<p>敵美於十月二十和二十一兩天，在塔克羅班及德拉格兩區突破日本的防衛綫，各登陸一師。後來逐漸增加援兵，現已達七師以上的兵力。敵美由於積極活動，遂漸向西展開戰綫，同時另一支部隊，正由南方攻我部隊的側翼。敵人最初的計劃，是以第一騎兵師擾亂我方塔克羅班的正面陣地，而以另一支軍隊向薩麻爾島直入。二十七日登陸的第二十四師團主力，向粵爾莫克平原挺進，而該師沿雷伊泰峽的左面，乘我不備而沿加里格拉灣岸西進，一部隊伍從加里格拉灣岸，向粵爾莫克市的關口麻諾格斯那斯，皮那毛班，里門一綫長驅挺進，顯示出一舉南下的形勢。我們的部隊，爲了對抗敵人這種企圖，得到新的精銳援軍後，冒着傾盆大雨，向敵陣衝鋒，與敵人以反包圍。另一部隊則向加里格拉灣岸加保幹綫前進，終於切斷敵人退路。</p>
<p>十一月十九日，敵方報進說：一日軍一部問有輕坦克車，曾攻擊里門的美國外綫包圍陣地」。在該處手足失措的敵人，很快又得到第一騎兵師的援兵到來，十二日登陸的第三十二師一部，也派來恢復前此失去的陣綫。二十日敵方的報道說：「日軍一部向里門三公里外的加里格拉灣岸皮那毛現附近的美國第三十二師一營攻擊，同時也曾攻擊六公里半外的加保幹附近美　第二十四師一部」。這是我方精銳部隊，冒雨殺向加里格拉和麻諾格斯那斯等險地，展開肉搏血戰的一幕</p>
<p>但敵人以德拉格登陸的第七師和第九十六師，向北方進攻，深入到阿蘭格蘭格，野羅，馬加爾白，布羅音一帶。另一部則沿阿布耶克和斐斐街道向西發展，經粵爾莫克灣，已達達姆拉安附近。這是企圖攻擊日軍日軍增援部隊的側翼。爲反抗這一點，日軍精銳部隊，在敵美軍隊實重的包圍中，而死守加特門山，同時堅守野羅，達格密，布羅音等西方高地，以等待良機，準備同敵美進行白刃戰，以粉碎敵人進擊的野心。在野羅地方，十一日夜，我軍敢死隊衝入，完全擊毁了數輛敵美坦克和牽引車。還有我方其他部隊，於八日，十二日，十三日三天，深入敵美砲兵陣地，瞬息間炸毁敵方重砲多門。這種戰法，竟使敵人胆戰心寒，因此敵美對粵爾莫克方面的砲轟，減少了很多。此外對於向答姆拉安襲來的敵美軍隊，從十八日起開始加以猛烈反擎，現在逐漸迫入南方。</p>
<p>戰况劇烈已極</p>
<p>配合這樣陸地部隊戰鬥的航空殲滅戰，是握有左右雷伊泰戰局的重大關鍵，目前戰况是悽慘熾烈，登峯造極，已達你死我活的階段。敵美在雷伊泰島上的作戰，是無飛機掩護的登陸戰。所以敵人展開陸地戰鬥時，立刻努力修理已佔領的塔克羅班，德拉格，參巴普羅等飛機塲，以求新幾內亞的陸地飛機大量遝來。此外機動部隊派來艦載機以補基地空軍的不足。這就是想以基地飛機和軍艦飛機，來爭取雷伊泰島上的制空權。麥克沃塞指揮下的新幾內亞飛機數，荷蘭底亞有一首架左右，皮亞克及農赫爾各有三百架至四百架，新幾內亞北岸麻爾有二百架左右，共一千五百架左右，以帛琉和擊洛泰島爲中繼基地，而轉運雷伊泰島，或直接空襲菲律賓南部。日本航空部隊爲了對抗美國此等飛機，以畫夜不停地敢死精神，反覆猛襲敵美基地，使其費盡心血　來的飛機，完全毀於轟炸。自十月二十七日以來，炸毀敵機已達二百餘架。</p>
<p>特攻隊的活躍</p>
<p>日本特別攻擊隊到處在打擊着敵方機動部隊，以大無畏的體撞戰術襲擎着敵方海上勢力，消毁着敵方艦載機的實力，於是敵方大言不慚地自誇局部絕對優勢主義，慘遭毀滅。同時我方神風攻擊隊還長程空襲洛斯奈格羅斯島，皮亞克，麻爾等敵美大後方基地。現在每天都不間斷地進行着殲滅戰</p>
<p>敵美補充困難</p>
<p>敵美艦船雖遭受我方不間斷的轟炸，但雷伊泰灣內仍椗泊有五六十艘，每天總有二三十艘大運輸船在拚命補充着。敵美一個兵士每月必要的軍需物資，大約爲六噸。如以十萬人左右的七個師團來計算，則每月非六十萬噸軍需物資的補充不可。按敵方公報說，雷伊泰登陸以來，三星期已有五十萬噸的軍需物資卸下。十月二十日登陸以來，至十一月十一日，運來五十萬噸軍需品，這就是說，每天足有二萬噸左右的物品運來。美團在法國諾曼第登陸作戰上，僅經過距離二十公里的杜佛海峽，也不過每天運輸兩萬噸軍需品，那末這樣看來，就可以知道敵美在雷伊泰登陸作戰的補充，是如何傾其全力的。雷伊泰島的敵人補充綫，是夏威夷，新喀里多尼亞，以澳洲爲基地而以荷蘭底亞，洛斯奈格羅斯島，塞班島等爲中繼基地，以摩洛泰和帛琉爲前進基地，用大規模的運輸船團來維持增强戰力的兵站棧。帛琉至雷伊泰爲兩千公里，摩洛泰至雷伊泰則爲一千公里，自澳洲或夏威夷均一萬公里以上。維持這一長程的補充綫，而向雷伊泰島不斷運輸軍需品，對於敵美說，實在已至筋疲力竭的地步了。</p>
<p>戰爭於我有利</p>
<p>自然，補充綫愈短則我戰爭愈有利，這是人所共知的軍事常識。而遠超過杜佛海峽數十倍的長程補充綫雷伊泰島，這是如何不利的冒險。假如這一補充綫被我方切斷，則美國在雷伊泰島登陸的軍隊，即可片甲不存。日本特別攻擊隊以寳貴的生命向敵美運輸船撞拚，這就是企圖切斷這一補充綫的有力武器。自十月十九日以來，按日本大本營所發表的戰果，我軍所擊沉或擊毁的運輸船，大小共七十三艘，如再算上遺漏者，其數字當更可觀。憂慮切斷這條海上補充綫的敵人，近來則由帛琉羣島以運輸機實行空中補充，而每日有三十架大型運輸機向雷伊泰運輸軍火和物資。固然這一航空補充綫是決定於天氣的，而不能談得上好，但敵人不能不利用這這一困難補充綫，正是他們以拚命精神來進行戰爭的。不僅我們日本在行　進拚命戰爭，而敵美也在進行着這樣的戰爭。（安譯自十一月二十日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>安定本市民食　採取緊爭措施　吳秘書長發表重要談話</h3>
<p>近日來黑市米價飛漲，各方注目，聞市府吳秘書長迭與有關方面暨市政諮詢委員會會商各項緊急措施，並積極籌備冬賑，以濟貧民。中央社記者爲明瞭眞相起見，特往訪問吳氏，承發表談話如左：</p>
<p>不法米商嚴查懲處</p>
<p>「近日米價飛漲，物價　貴，人民生活咸受威脅，社會頓成不安現象，其中原因雖極複雜，但奸商國積操縱，任意抬價，同時奸點之徒，故佈謠言，擾亂人心，尤堪痛心。本人秉承陳市長之命，在代行期間，繼無旁貸，自當極盡智慮，盡力應付，以謀挽救。經與有關方面交涉洽商後，各項措置業經決定，（一）對於不法米商，操縱米價，以圖暴利，巳飭主管機關嚴密偵査，如査有確據，定當嚴予懲處，以爲妨害民生者戒。（二）加配雜糧，以惠平民，業由物品配給處公吿發售。</p>
<p>戶口米決儘先配給</p>
<p>（三）戶口米配給經與米統會洽商後，決定儘先配給，數量不變。（四）配給米價格，以成本而言，早已超過五千元，但市府爲滅輕人民負擔，及便利米統會採辦米糧起見，仍維持五千元價格，其差額每月需費四萬萬二千萬元，業由市府負責籌措，一面正在設法商請社會予以協助，俟計畫實現後，最近期內配給米價自可維持不變。此外設廠施粥，以濟貧民，疏通來源，抑低米價，亦在分別準備，冀在最短時期內，付之實施。</p>
<p>頭等飯館禁止賣飯</p>
<p>所望市民特別注意者，第一市民每戶儲糧最多仍不得超過三個月之實際需量，切勿逾量囤積，致受懲處。第二市內頭等飯館，早經前第一區公署桂止賣飯，此項禁令繼續有效，故各該飯館務須恪遵禁令，不得私自擅開禁例，或竟藉詞購存大量米糧，以圖厚利，倘或故違，常予懲處。總之，市府對於米糧問題之嚴重性，早具深切認識，本人責職所在，自常悉力以赴，以期及早解決，切盼各界人士對於現階段之上海重要性，均能有深切體認。當知戰爭期內，日常生活應以節約嚴肅爲第一要義，果能重視公衆利益，抑制個人私慾，鎭靜自持，刻苦互勵，一切無稽謠言，自可消滅於無形，而社會安寗，亦可確保，此則本市市民所當憬然自覺，相互勗勉者也。</p>
<p>市府人員待遇改善</p>
<p>至負有地方治安責任之軍警及警務人員，市府爲顧念其生活，已自十月份起按其餉額，增加百分之百，其他所屬機關職員之待過，亦巳增給津貼，予以改善。雖在物價暴漲之時，澈底調整，尙多困難，而市府常局體恤屬員之心，當能共喻。官吏爲人民公僕，一舉一動，在在足以影響社會，在此非常時期，切盼共體時艱，振作精神，努力工作，以副政府與社會之期望。」</p>
<h3>確保戰時治安　厲行特別刑法　警察當局發表談話</h3>
<p>本市警察當局爲關於通用戰時刑事特別法，發表談話如下：國府於民國三十二年五月十日公佈戰時刑事特別法，其公佈主要目的爲，第一，防止於敵襲時之危險，或警戒中可豫想之一般刑事犯罪之增加。第二，防遏戰時政治犯妨害秩序，及共他擾亂治安等行爲。第三，確立戰時防空體勢。第四，保護戰時特殊生產事業及公共事業。第五，確立戰時統制經濟等，以期完遂戰時之治安，維持庶民生活之安定，軍需之確保等諸目的。</p>
<p>强化法令絕滅罪行</p>
<p>最近戰局愈趨苛烈，本市已遭數次空襲，直接有受空襲之危機，或於警戒時，即可到來。一方面有一部不逞之徒，反動份子乘機犯法，更有一部惡德食利無恥份子不顧公衆之福祉，紊亂統制等不正行爲，抵觸戰時特別法令，竟敢大膽逍遙法外，可恨已極，有鑑於斯，實有强化本法之必要。最近當局屢次闡明經濟取締之强化，防空體勢之確立，謠言之取締等，爲期其澈底取締起見，對本法全面之運用，與各關係機關業已商榷，斷乎嚴令發動，强化本法，以期保持法令之尊嚴，仰一般市民充分理解當局意旨，自省自肅，協力絕滅此種犯行是盼。</p>
<p>普通刑事加重處分</p>
<p>再關於戰時特別法之內容，或有尙未熟知者，玆再略爲槪述如次：（一）普通刑事犯罪：普通刑事犯罪中如放火，決水，强盜，强姦，暴行，猥褻，竊盜，掠奪，恐嚇等之犯罪，於敵製危險時，或正警戒中適用戰時刑事特別法，其刑較一般刑法特別加重，大略如下：（一）放火決水，（三年年以上有期或無期徒刑）（二）强姦，（五年以上徒刑）（三）暴行猥褻，（十年以上有期徒刑或無期徒刑）（四）竊盜，（一年以上七年以下徒刑）（五）掠奪（同右）（六）强盜，（五年以上徒刑）（七）恐嚇。（一年以上七年以下徒刑）</p>

<h3>食油蔬菜　提高限價價</h3>
<p>本市物價評議委員會於十三次評議時，關於食油提高限價一案，以油糧統制會提出限價，係根據油商呈請，當時價格每市斤爲國幣四百六十五元，認爲其所請限價與黑市相差無幾，故決議函請油糧統制會重行審定，現油糧統制會愼重審議后，函復該會，故決定食用油類，限價每市斤批發爲國幣四百十元，另售每市斤爲四百三十五元。同時本局蔬菜限價亦據中央市塲所評定限價，予以折中，評議結果，計靑菜每市斤爲國幣五十九元八角，菠菜每市斤一百三十元，長折蘿卜每市斤五十九元，洋山芋每市斤七十元，粉干每市斤四百八十元正。查此次關於食油提高限價，與上次評定限價相差一倍之鉅即蔬菜一項，時間相差一週，黑市價格猛漲不已，而評議之物價，亦隨之步步飛騰，頗有助長黑市之槪，甚盼評價當局，予以縝密注意。</p>
<h3>八公斤以下食米　嚴禁留難搬運　操縱居奇嚴予懲處</h3>
<p>本市食米黑市價，前以奸商操縱，在人心搖動之中猛漲不已，威脅民生，殊非淺鮮。旋經各方一致努力結果，已稍形回跌，但仍未復原。本市經濟局以廢曆年關將近，刻正寄予十分重視，尤以八公斤以下米糧自由搬運，早經明白規定，絕未變更，倘有散佈謠言，冀圖操縱居奇者，定當嚴予懲處，並經函各縣區對於八公斤以下食米搬運，如有沿途留難需索等情事，准人民隨時密吿，以憑懲辦。又密派幹員到郊區偵査，倘有操縱提便者，一經査實，定當嚴厲處分。復以農業增產爲當務之急，刻正積極進行，並計劃將本市所有公私空地，儘量利用，獎勵市民種植雜糧，以代替食米，以便減少白米消耗量，則對於軍需民食，兩有裨益，而食米價格，亦不難下跌。</p>
<h3>法商公共汽車　將恢復原綫</h3>
<p>本市法商二十二路公共汽車自上月下旬縮短路綫，自外灘至囊陽路止，故徐家滙一帶居民大感不便，乃聯名呈請市商會，轉商於公司當局，恢復原駛路綫，市商會據呈後派員與公用局聯絡，葉局長允召法商電車公司負責人到局談話，飭將二十二路汽東路綫恢復至天平路，便利市民。</p>

<h3>成義中小學校　實行「儲蓄助學運動」</h3>
<p>本報昨接成義中學暨小學部全體學生來函，略謂自本學期起，即發起「儲蓄助學運動」，以儉約克巴，行善助人爲生旨，迄本月底止，已儲得三萬元，先行認組一隊。並希望各校學生能聞風響應，樹學生界尙儉好義之風，用意至善，殊堪欽敬，茲將所附緣起錄下：</p>

<p>儲蓄助學運動辦法</p>
<p>（一）本校各生應本儉約自束之旨，儘量節省儲蓄，養成儉樸之風。（二）本校各生應本樂善之願，慷慨助學，養成尙義之風。（三）每週各生將儲蓄之錢，於星期二·五·兩次交與組長，登記後由級長彙繳敎導處，同時將各生所儲捐欵公佈之。（四）每週星期三·六·將各級學生儲蓄捐欵彙存上海銀行，並將各級組之總額公佈之，予以競賽，其成績特優者，予以獎勵。（五）所有儲捐之疑，由本校彙送申報館，擬請該館贈儲捐紀念票，分紅·黃·藍·三色以十元·五十元·一百元三種分別之。（六）於一學期終共儲捐總額最多之學生，除由本校予以獎勵外，別由申報館定予獎勵品或紀念品。（七）本辦法由各級導師督導推行，並由各級級組長負責辦理之。　（按）關於第五條所開辦法，本報亦可照辦，惟望各學校一致推行，並先來函表示意見，以憑辦理。</p>

<h3>急待商計的　學費問題</h3>
<p>— 廣沅</p>
<p>目前物價問題已成爲上海每個市民最嚴重的問題，然而學費問題亦成爲每個家長們的最苦惱問題。本學期還只有一個多月，下學期轉瞬就要來臨，而許多學校中下學期應納學費若干，已經非正式的傳出，私立大學約在四萬元左右，中學約兩萬餘元，我們對于這個數目不能不表示驚駭，雖然一般人說錢不値錢，但是要拿出幾萬元來也並非容易，尤其一般中產階級而子女又衆多者，你呌他們怎辦？</p>
<p>我們不能否認，一部分校長們的私囊，都在膨大起來，筆者是一個大學生，我願意以自己之所見所聞，來証明有許多學校確爲學店。</p>
<p>（一）敎授每鐘點之代價，在開學前只有一個最低的數目，俟開學後看學生人數之多寡而遞增，但具是否如理想之數目呢？這是否不是在打算盤呢？</p>
<p>（二）有個學校申請到貸學金的學生，全要寫一張筆據，言明本人畢業後數年內如數還淸，貸金本應償還，然而如此還法，未免顯得太苛刻。</p>
<p>（三）學校財政同國家財政一樣，應當收支相敷，然而有些學校中學生繳費有九折優待之享受，從一個作學生的立場上，試問有何感想？</p>
<p>此等實例，不勝枚舉，最簡單你只要算一算學校中所收的學費，是否與學校中的支出相等，我覺得這也許是一個極嚴重的問題，不能不以謀解決，據我個人的意見有三點，以資商討：</p>
<p>第一可謂消極的，即是請一般學校中的校長大人們放出勇氣來，他們都是知識階級，不會不知道敎育使命的重大，尤其是戰時的敎育，更爲緊要，這裏喪有幾點：</p>
<p>（一）學校的財政希望完全公開，收支相敷。</p>
<p>（二）學生學費可分期繳納，以滅輕家長負擔。</p>
<p>（三）學費不妨訂一最低數目，如後來超出預算，可再由學生負擔，當然須要互相諒解，只要到此地步決不會再有問題發生。</p>
<p>第二即積極的方法，如果有一兩個敎育界的敗類，不肯放棄自己的財源，則惟有請有關當局加以制裁，最初以忠言相吿，如再執迷不悟，只有用權力來干涉。</p>
<p>（一）學校財政由當局派人管理或派人預算，務使簡潔廉明而收支相敷，校長或校董仍給以名義職務及適當之薪金。</p>
<p>（二）有人曾提議過：「學費限價」。實在說起來，處在今日上海，未始不可施用，當然這不是根本解決的辦法。</p>
<p>第三爲折衷辦法，不知這個辦法是否合理，是否可能爲社會上所允許，就是校方派人對學生家庭作嚴密調査，現學生家庭的情形而派其應繳納之學費，務要使學校學生打成一片，當然能够作得很好並非一件易事，但我想像亦並非難事，只要有心人，不怕不會成功。</p>
<p>最後我有點貢獻給學校：就是學校應當儘量節流，節流外還要開源，以減輕學生負擔，例如：</p>
<p>（一）節流方面：職工的事情可由學生分工合作，攷試時紙張可由學生自備，紙張由學生自備，兩紙張不足輕重，而學校採辦一大批，則實爲大……等。</p>
<p>（二）開源方面：除學費收入，當局津貼外界募欵外，學校可領導學生，以其所長而作生產工作，定爲課外實習之必修科目，（例如農科學生可使其種植等）使學校之資產增加，亦即減輕學生之負擔也。</p>
<p>現在社會上助學金機關雖甚多，然究爲杯水車薪，不濟於事，希望賢明當局爲中國敎育前途，有所改正，是千萬學子之幸，亦安定民生之策也。</p>

<h3>Minister Chen Returns to the Capital After Completing Mission in Japan; Allied Nations Remember Sincere Talks Yielded Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Propaganda Department issued a communiqué at 4:00 PM today: Premier of the National Government's Executive Yuan departed on the 14th of this month to visit Japan. He held sincere talks with representatives of allied nations regarding problems of close cooperation in completing the war, which were extremely satisfactory. He departed Tokyo on the 19th and arrived back in the capital at 2:50 PM on the 20th. Deputy Premier Zhou of the National Government and dozens of other military and government leaders went to the airport to greet him. The senior officials accompanying Premier Chen on his visit to Japan, with the exception of Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who was dispatched to Nagoya to personally pay respects at Chairman Wang Jingwei's bedside in the hospital, express gratitude to allied government officials, civilians, and doctors, and participate in the local memorial service, all others, including Minister Xiao, Minister Lin, and Secretary Zhou, returned to Nanjing with Premier Chen. A record of Premier Chen's remarks upon returning to the country follows:</p>
<h3>Premier Chen Urges National Populace to Firmly Cooperate With Allied Nations With Determination to Share Weal and Woe</h3>
<p>"During my visit to Japan, I received warm treatment from Prime Minister Koiso and the ministers, as well as the Japanese people. I held candid discussions with the officials of the allied nations, exchanging views in a sincere and harmonious manner, just as in the past, which I found deeply gratifying. The allied nations' earnestness in supporting and sincerity in assisting China are constantly increasing. It is needless to say that cooperation between the two countries will become even closer in the future. Furthermore, the strengthening of the National Government's leadership in guiding the entire population towards the goal of independence and autonomy holds limitless promise.</p>
<p>Allied Nations' Public Morale is Tempered and Inspired</p>
<p>Although my stay was very short, I witnessed the unwavering determination and inspiring morale of the allied nations, both in government and among the people, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Repeated enemy air raids have failed to inflict the slightest damage; instead, public sentiment and morale have been further boosted. The accelerated progress of production, the doubled and enriched military supplies, the diligence of labor, and the eagerness to enlist in the military create an atmosphere even more intense than before, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Unwavering Commitment to Promoting National Policy</p>
<p>I wish to express my sincere thoughts and encourage my compatriots to promote peace, unite Japan, and stabilize East Asia, which are the missions of the National Government's return to the capital. To cooperate in the war, to unite Asia, and to defeat the United States and Britain are the current responsibilities of China, which is participating in the war. These are all unfinished national policies of Chairman Wang. Although Chairman Wang did not live to see the completion of peaceful unification and the completion of the war, his spirit of loving China and loving East Asia will forever guide us to continue our struggle. Having experienced this great pain, the National Government and the entire nation are acutely aware of the severity of the situation and even more mindful of the arduousness of our responsibility. We vow to fulfill his legacy and will never waver.</p>
<p>Overcoming All Obstacles to Promote Peace</p>
<p>The most important tasks at present are to strengthen our cooperative resolve to fight the decisive battle, crush the remaining forces of the brutal enemy seeking to invade East Asia again, and overcome all obstacles to complete China's unification and promote comprehensive peace. From the former perspective, the allied nations are already mobilizing their national strength to act as the vanguard and shield. China in East Asia should constantly redouble its combat strength, consolidate the rear, and supply the front lines. From the latter perspective, the狰狞面目 of Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly exposed. Even those in Chongqing will gradually realize that relying on the United States and Britain is a miscalculation. The reckless and indiscriminate bombing, deliberately creating scorched earth, is something that all people throughout the country deeply resent. In this situation, we must both strive to strengthen the National Government itself, so that it can bear the great responsibility of resolving the current situation, and implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and uphold the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the utmost sincerity, in order to build the foundation for righteous peace.</p>
<p>Strengthening the National Government to Cooperate in the War</p>
<p>The way to cooperate in the war includes rectifying thought, ensuring social order, and increasing production. All efforts to supply military needs, stabilize the people's livelihood, and benefit the war effort should be given the highest priority. The way to strengthen the National Government includes building up the military, organizing and training the people, and establishing honest government. All efforts to cultivate the people's strength, accumulate national power, and consolidate the foundation of the nation should be actively pursued. These two aspects must be mutually reinforcing and cannot be neglected in any way. In short, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Sharing life and death is a historical destiny. China's freedom and equality and East Asia's independence and liberation depend on this one battle. As a member of the nations participating in the war and a pillar of the East Asian axis, China bears a heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Upholding Our Beliefs and Going All Out</p>
<p>The National Government vows to adhere to this belief, lead the people with the determination to share life and death, strengthen cooperation with the allied nations, and strengthen our cooperation in the war. We aim to uphold the original intention of the peace movement, fulfill our oath to participate in the alliance, and not fail the sincerity of our allied friends in assisting us. We will do everything in our power to develop the wartime system of the National Government. We also believe that the allied governments and their people will provide further assistance based on the spirit of the alliance treaty and the joint declaration."</p>

<h3>North China to Establish Securities Exchange</h3>
<p>Beiping, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to mobilize purchasing power and guide it in the right direction, with the aim of increasing investment in urgent areas in the current situation, the North China Political Affairs Commission has been studying the establishment of a strong securities exchange in North China. This has now been realized. The Economic General Office issued letters of encouragement to economic organizations such as banking associations, money shop associations, and chambers of commerce in the four major cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan on the 19th, urging them to elect promoters to establish this new exchange. The capital will be 20 million yuan (fully paid up). The relevant Chinese merchants in the four cities will bear the following shares: Beiping 4 million yuan, Tianjin 10 million yuan, Qingdao and Jinan 2.5 million yuan each. The establishment procedures are expected to be completed by the end of January next year at the latest.</p>
<h3>Temporary Exemption from Epidemic Prevention Inspections for Travel Throughout North China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The North China Medical and Health Committee previously implemented quarantine inspections for travelers in North China to prevent the spread of epidemics. As the epidemic prevention period ended on November 30, it has ordered all subordinate epidemic prevention and quarantine agencies to temporarily suspend inspections. It has also telegraphed the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee to inform all regions that travelers going to North China will be temporarily exempt from epidemic prevention inspections.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Wang Control Association After Reorganization of the Business Control Council (3)</h3>
<p>(III) Daily Necessities Control Committee</p>
<p>(1) Establishment Process</p>
<p>Regarding the control of soap, candles, and matches, the soap and candle portions were originally handled by the Soap and Candle Professional Department established by the National General Business Control Council, while the match portion was handled by the Match Industry Association. Subsequently, after the Executive Yuan announced the adjustment of the materials control organization, the Daily Necessities Control Committee was established to assist the government in implementing economic measures and handle the aforementioned materials control affairs.

<h3>The Significance of Mr. Yoshida and Mr. Kobayashi Joining the Cabinet is Great; They Will Contribute to the War Effort With the Strength of the Entire Nation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - With the resignation of Military Supplies Minister Fujiwara due to illness, the Koiso Cabinet suddenly reorganized the cabinet on the 19th, appointing Yoshida Shigeru, chairman of the Kyushu Regional Council, as his successor, and requested Kobayashi Tsubasa, president of the Political Association, to become a minister without portfolio in order to establish a decisive political system integrating officials and civilians. Prime Minister Koiso received Military Supplies Minister Fujiwara's resignation on the 16th. After immediately evaluating potential successors, he decided to request Yoshida Shigeru, who is currently in charge of military supplies production and enhancement in the Kyushu region, to rush to the capital. On the 18th, he received his agreement. At the same time, in order to strengthen political power and complete the absolute connection between the cabinet and the people, Prime Minister Koiso further requested General Kobayashi Minzo, president of the Political Association, to become a minister without portfolio. After negotiations, he also received his agreement on the 18th. Thus, the vacant post of state minister was filled, completing parliamentary politics. The appointment of Yoshida as Military Supplies Minister is based on his past experience, and he will surely be able to fully exert his talents. It will also fully harmonize the personnel aspect of the cabinet and make a considerable contribution to military supplies production. Today, when the linkage between military supplies production and service personnel urgently needs to be opened, it is waiting for a person with prestigious experience in the local administrative front line to take office. He is the right candidate, and the establishment of a sure-win and invincible production system is worth expecting. In addition, the strengthening of cabinet politics and the enhancement of military supplies production are both indispensable key points in the current decisive war situation. Prime Minister Koiso, in view of this, will request General Kobayashi, the president of the Political Association, the only political organization in the country, to serve as Minister of State, but in the aspect of General Kobayashi, he is entering the cabinet in the capacity of president of the Political Association, so it has a special meaning. From now on, the government's policies will be thoroughly implemented to the lower levels of the people through the mechanism of the Political Association, so as to contribute the strength of the whole country to the Philippine battlefield.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of State Kobayashi Issues Inaugural Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Minister of State Kobayashi, who recently entered the cabinet in the capacity of president of the Political Association, issued the following statement at the Political Association headquarters after the inaugural ceremony: This time, I received the great command to enter the cabinet. I believe that the war situation is extremely severe and has now progressed to the final stage of national destiny. Given this current situation, it is urgently necessary to embody the substance of unity between the military, officials, and civilians, based on the spirit of the Special Attack Forces, in order to advance and complete the holy war. Therefore, politics should directly combine with the people, and government policies should be responsive to the people, in order to establish a political system. The Political Association is a bond between the government and the people, and its realization is a major mission entrusted to this association. The reason why I decided to enter the cabinet in the capacity of president is precisely for this. In addition, the various wartime policies investigated and researched by the Political Association are all appropriate matters based on public opinion. It is also an urgent task to strongly promote these policies within the cabinet and have the government implement them decisively. I will do my best to serve the country based on the above purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. Otani and Mr. Terai Appointed as Advisors to the Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In October, the Japanese government reorganized the cabinet advisory system, appointing twelve authoritative figures from various fields, including former Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, as cabinet advisors to participate in political affairs. Now, it has additionally appointed former Cabinet Councilor Otani Kozui and former President of the Ship Operation Association and President of Nippon Yusen, Terai Hisanobu, as cabinet advisors. The official announcement was made on the 20th. Otani is an authority in the religious world, and Terai is an authority in the shipping world.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Association Holds Temporary House of Representatives Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Political Association held a temporary House of Representatives committee meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 19th to discuss various matters related to the operation of the 86th Diet session. It was agreed that in this critical situation, the Political Association should strongly promote the government's urgent tasks. The main points of the opinions are as follows: In this decisive war session, the issue of national organization should be raised. It is necessary to establish a strong combination between politics and the people. The Political Association itself should resolutely implement strong politics for national organization. The Diet committee will convene daily meetings from the 20th to study concrete measures to obtain a solution in preparation for submission to the Diet, so that the government can implement it decisively.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister Declares Determination to Win at All Costs</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the occasion of the upcoming third anniversary of the conclusion of the Thai-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse received a group of Japanese reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 19th and issued a statement. The gist of his statement was: What Thailand seeks now is victory. Therefore, the Thai people are determined to devote all their strength to completing the war and fighting until the day of final victory. We dare not predict when the war will end, but Thailand is a special country and bears the important task of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we must first prepare and stabilize the domestic system as a prerequisite for completing the war. I would like to place the focus of policy for the coming year on domestic and national policies. What Thailand needs most now is clothing, so we plan to increase cotton production and encourage textiles at the same time. Thailand has extremely abundant food supplies, so the people's livelihood can be stabilized, and there is no need to worry about the food problem. It is also easier to implement various policies. In short, as the war situation becomes increasingly fierce, national life will inevitably feel considerable difficulties. We, the Thai people, are determined to overcome all difficulties and, in the spirit of Thai-Japanese cooperation, fight to the last soldier.</p>
<h3>Three-Dimensional Warfare Unfolds on the German-Belgian Border Himmler Personally Supervises the Battle on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Supreme Headquarters issued a war bulletin at noon on the 19th, stating the new offensive in northern Luxembourg as follows: In the winter war on the Western Front, German troops continued to attack on the entire front line on the 18th. Tank units penetrated deep into the battle area through the gaps in the fragmented US First Army. Trench warfare continued in other past focal points of the Western Front. German long-range weapons further strengthened their power, attacking London, Antwerp, and other places.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to front-line reports: German SS Chief Himmler is now personally commanding the German troops who are desperately defending the bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine River in southern Alsace.</p>
<p>German Counter-Offensive Forces are Powerful</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a German news agency, a military observer in London said: The German army on the Western Front has launched a four-day offensive, which is currently unfolding with great strength. Eight or nine divisions, three or four tank divisions of the Tiger type and a variety of new weapons. Although it is not yet known how far the German army has penetrated into Belgium, a report from the front line of the US First Army stated that the German army has retaken Malmedy (in eastern Belgium, north of Luxembourg). The anti-axis forces do not shy away from this serious war situation.</p>
<p>The Front Line Extends for One Hundred Kilometers</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Eisenhower Command issued a communique on the 19th stating that the "Rundstedt Offensive," which has been unfolding on a large front line approximately 100 kilometers long from Monschau, 40 kilometers southeast of Aachen, to the border of Luxembourg, has suddenly intensified on the 19th. According to a United Press front-line report, the leading tank vanguard of the German army, which is firmly grasping the initiative of the war, quickly shelled the railway hub of Malmedy, destroying the stubborn resistance of the US fighter squadrons. According to an Associated Press front-line report, since the outbreak of fighting in the west, the large-scale three-dimensional war of air and land has gradually intensified. It is speculated that the German army will implement a fairly large-scale offensive in the future.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>European War Situation</h3>
<p>The year 1944 is almost over, but the European war, which the anti-Axis powers predicted would end within the year, remains deadlocked. The arrogance and underestimation of Germany by Britain and the United States have clearly suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>Currently, the European war seems relatively quiet on the Western Front in the Netherlands and on the Southern Front in Italy. The frozen front along the Baltic coast and in Romania and Bulgaria has largely come to an end. The most intense fighting is concentrated on the Western Front in Belgium and Luxembourg, the border between France and Germany, and on the Eastern Front around the Hungarian capital and the eastern border of Slovakia.</p>
<p>On the Western Front, the Battle for Aachen, in central Belgium where it borders Germany, has continued unabated. From Aachen, southward along the German-Belgian border through the Malmedy area to Trier in eastern Luxembourg and then to the Saar, the anti-Axis forces have constantly attempted to break through the Siegfried Line and advance toward the Rhineland region of western Germany. However, they have consistently been blocked by the powerful German army. Even when there has been progress, it has been minimal, and the anti-Axis forces have suffered losses far outweighing their gains. Also, along the southern part of the Western Front, from Saarbrücken in the Saar region along the German border through Saargemünd and into the narrow Alsace region, fierce fighting has been unfolding daily. This is the route the anti-Axis forces are attempting to take to attack from the southwestern border of Germany.</p>
<p>On the Eastern Front, the Hungarian capital Budapest remains the focus of the fighting. Soviet forces have penetrated Budapest, and the two sides are now in a stalemate northeast of Budapest, with intense fighting. South of Budapest, west of the Danube and southeast of Lake Balaton, Soviet forces appear to be adopting a similarly aggressive offensive. Recently, the Soviet forces have also focused on Slovakia, so they have also deployed many troops to fight in the eastern and southern borders of Slovakia. The line from Miskolc in Hungary to Košice in Slovakia seems to be particularly important to the Soviet forces. In addition, Soviet forces advancing southward from the Vistula River in Poland, north of Slovakia, are launching an offensive centered on Krakow. The Soviet forces appear to be launching offensives on Slovakia from the east, south, and north, with the aim of attacking Slovakia from three directions.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the most intense areas of the European war are the German-Belgian border centered on the Aachen area on the Western Front, followed by the Saar and Alsace regions. On the Eastern Front, the focus is on Budapest, spreading to western Hungary and between Hungary and Slovakia.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis forces have mobilized enormous manpower and resources in both the Eastern and Western Fronts, from the summer offensive to the current winter offensive. The intensity of their offensives is truly astonishing, but the results they have achieved are far too poor. Observing that the Western Front has been stuck on the German-Belgian-French border for months and that Budapest on the Eastern Front has been difficult to capture for a long time, it can be seen that the losses of the anti-Axis forces far outweigh their gains. In recent days, the German army on the Western Front has shown a tendency to shift from defense to offense, and the German army in Budapest has also been successful in counterattacking the Soviet forces. The overall war situation is still not unfavorable to the German army.</p>
<p>In short, while the anti-Axis offensive is fierce, the Axis forces' resistance is even stronger. Some shortsighted observers previously underestimated the Axis powers in terms of military, economic, and political aspects, based on temporary changes in strategy. However, the recent facts - the strength of the Axis forces' resistance over the past few months - should give them a clear understanding. In any case, the anti-Axis forces are unable to force Germany to surrender, either militarily or politically. At the same time, the contradictions between the anti-Axis camps regarding the solution of European problems are becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, we should not lightly believe the anti-Axis propaganda when observing the European situation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Enemy Warships, Sinking and Destroying Twelve Ships in the Sulu Sea and Other Waters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After enemy forces landed near San Jose on Mindoro Island, south of Luzon Island, Japanese air units have concentrated their main forces to fiercely bomb the enemy's core warships, inflicting enormous damage through suicide attacks by special attack units and other means. The enemy forces, unable to withstand the fierce Japanese attacks, stubbornly continued to resupply the landing forces. As a result, the situation in the Sulu Sea became increasingly tense. On the 17th and 18th, Japanese air units continued to bomb the battlefield. According to the announcement of the Imperial General Headquarters, a total of six enemy transport ships were sunk and destroyed. The general situation of the war is recorded as follows: (1) On the 17th, air units (including special attack units) bombed enemy warships in the Mindoro Sea, sinking one medium-sized transport vessel and one escort cruiser and one destroyer each. In addition, two places near the enemy landing site were set on fire. In this battle, special attack units and escort fighters crashed and detonated themselves. (2) On the 18th, Japanese air units (including special attack units) bombed enemy forces, sinking one large transport ship, destroying another warship, and damaging one medium-sized transport ship, causing it to be on the verge of stopping. On the evening of the same day, the Tekkishin Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit hit a transport ship near San Jose, which sank into the sea after seven minutes. On the 13th, the Ichiu Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit and other air units bombed an enemy convoy invading the area near the mouth of the Sulu Sea River south of Iloilo, but the results were unclear. However, after a subsequent investigation, it was confirmed that one transport ship and one large warship resembling an aircraft carrier or large cruiser were both engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air squadrons have been fiercely bombing enemy warships invading the Sulu Sea for days. On the afternoon of the 18th, two aircraft from the elite Flying Corps of the Special Attack Unit took the lead, and several fighter aircraft were turned into bombs and dispatched together. They attacked the enemy transport ship group in the waters of San Jose on Mindoro Island, overcoming the stubborn resistance of about 40 enemy P38 and P47 and giant fighter aircraft patrolling the sky. One large transport ship and one transport ship were sunk and destroyed, and one transport ship was destroyed. In addition, one P47 and one P38 were shot down in the aerial battle, and one P47 and one P35 were damaged. On the Japanese side, in addition to one aircraft from the elite corps, one aircraft was crashed in a suicide attack and four aircraft did not return. At the same time, several fighter aircraft, including the leader of the Tekkishin Special Attack Unit, from separate strike groups, fiercely attacked the enemy convoy in confusion and retreat, also sinking one of their transport ships. Combining the above results, since the 13th, Japanese army air squadrons have sunk and destroyed twelve enemy ships in the Mindanao Sea and Sulu Sea.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - The American forces that landed in the San Jose area of Mindoro Island were intercepted by the Japanese forces stationed there. It is unclear how they are progressing. The enemy forces are currently choosing a plain in the area to hastily build an airfield, but their maritime supply is facing a major threat due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units and air units. On the other hand, in the Ormoc area of Leyte Island, the Japanese Takachiho Unit and the garrison forces are still fiercely attacking the enemy forces that have detoured into the area from the Kigueon Heights, suppressing the enemy forces. There are no significant changes in other front lines on Leyte Island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Raiding Party Attacks Morotai Island With Success</h3>
<p>Japanese Base on Southern Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - From November 7th to 11th, Japanese raiding parties launched daring attacks on the enemy airfield at Tadarhala on Morotai Island, and have now returned to base.

<h3>Lieutenant Endo of the Gekko Unit Discusses Intercepting Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Japanese Air Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Endo Yukio of the Gekko Fighter Squadron shot down one enemy B-29 aircraft and damaged two on the 18th when striking the main force of the enemy B-29 formation that invaded the Nagoya area. Commending Lieutenant Endo for this remarkable feat, the reporter visited Lieutenant Endo at a certain air base. It was learned that Lieutenant Endo was a graduate of the Type A Flight Preparatory Training Course and had performed outstandingly in the battles of Rabaul and other battles. This summer, he shot down and damaged five enemy B-29 aircraft over northern Kyushu. On the 3rd of this month, he shot down three enemy aircraft off the coast of Kashima. He has been decorated three times for his achievements, having shot down a total of eleven of the enemy's much-vaunted "air fortresses". The following is Lieutenant Endo's account of the interception battle: On that day, the sky over the base was very foggy. At 2200 hours, the battle command issued an order: "An enemy formation is heading north toward the central region. All aircraft must sortie immediately." The Gekko fighters on standby took off from the base one after another and immediately climbed rapidly after takeoff. However, at an altitude of approximately 7,000 meters, ten enemy aircraft were spotted near Mount Fuji. Unfortunately, there was still a distance of several thousand meters between us and them, so no attack was made. We continued to advance westward. At 1250 hours, visibility worsened. Upon reaching the interception destination, the sky over □□, enemy aircraft were immediately spotted. Eight enemy B-29 aircraft were sighted in formation. My aircraft charged past the lead enemy aircraft and engaged the second enemy aircraft in a head-on battle. The enemy aircraft could not withstand the attack and instantly emitted black smoke from the engine, immediately turning into a ball of fire and plunging downward. The enemy aircraft, in a state of panic, did not have time to reorganize their formation and quickly reversed course, penetrating the formation from below. Before long, our side began to concentrate its attack. With the determination to fight to the death, we attacked the seventh enemy aircraft and then attacked the eighth enemy aircraft. Both enemy aircraft were seen emitting black smoke from the engines and heading into the clouds behind the enemy aircraft formation. Although my aircraft was hit by enemy fire, it was eventually able to safely return to base.</p>
<h3>Three Enemy Aircraft Damaged in Attack on Kyushu</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 30 to 40 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked Kyushu from the direction of the Chinese mainland on the morning of the 19th. The sky over the area was covered in dense clouds, and the enemy aircraft were only able to carry out blind bombing, so the damage on the ground was extremely light. Local air defense units engaged the enemy aircraft in an interception battle above the clouds, and as a result, it has been determined so far that the enemy aircraft suffered damage to approximately three aircraft or more.</p>
<h3>Manchu Special Attack Team Member Promoted to Major</h3>
<p>Manchuria, 20th (Central News Agency) - Kasuga Sono, a first lieutenant in the Kwantung Army's Special Attack Unit Orchid, daringly crashed into and destroyed an enemy B-29 aircraft over Fengtian on the 7th.

<h3>Decisive Battle on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, the mutual offensive and defensive battles for one month have become more and more intense day by day. The enemy Americans are using the strength of seven divisions to attempt to expand the occupied area, while we are constantly sending new elite troops to the front line to block them. Some advance units have already unfolded unprecedentedly astonishing decisive battles along the shores of Carigara Bay, the central highlands of Jaro, the Dagami area, the shores of Ormoc Bay, and the Damulaan line. In addition, the remaining enemy forces have appeared on the eastern sea of the Philippines and are bombing important areas of our Philippine Islands. But our air forces on both the land and sea sides are using earth-shattering body-crashing tactics to inflict fatal blows on them. The great battle between the enemy and us, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, can be said to have reached the stage of a decisive final battle on the land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>Crushing Enemy's Attempt</p>
<p>On October 20th and 21st, the enemy Americans broke through the Japanese defense line in the Tacloban and Dulag areas, each landing one division. Later, they gradually increased their reinforcements, and now they have reached more than seven divisions. Due to active operations, the enemy Americans gradually expanded the battle line to the west, while another unit was attacking the flank of our forces from the south. The enemy's initial plan was to use the 1st Cavalry Division to disrupt our front line positions in Tacloban, and to have another army directly enter Samar Island. The main force of the 24th Division, which landed on the 27th, advanced toward the Ormoc Plain, while the division advanced westward along the left side of the Leyte Strait, taking us by surprise, and some troops advanced rapidly from the shores of Carigara Bay to the line of Manogosnos, Pinamoapan, and Limon at the entrance of Ormoc City, showing a move to go south in one fell swoop. In order to counter this attempt by the enemy, our forces, after receiving new elite reinforcements, charged into the enemy's positions in torrential rain and launched a counter-encirclement against the enemy. Another unit advanced toward the Carigara-Capoocan line, finally cutting off the enemy's retreat.</p>
<p>On November 19th, the enemy report said: "A unit of Japanese forces, including light tanks, attacked the American outer encirclement positions in Limon." The enemy, at a loss in that area, was quickly reinforced by the 1st Cavalry Division, and a part of the 32nd Division, which landed on the 12th, was also sent to restore the previously lost lines. A report from the enemy on the 20th stated: "A unit of the Japanese army attacked a battalion of the American 32nd Division near Pinamauhay, 3 kilometers from Limon on the shores of Carigara Bay, and also attacked a part of the American 24th Division near Capoocan, 6.5 kilometers away." This is a scene of our elite forces braving the rain to advance into the dangerous areas of Carigara and Manogosnos, engaging in close-quarters bloody battles.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's 7th Division and 96th Division, which landed in Dulag, advanced northward, penetrating into the Alangalang, Jaro, Magallanes, and Burauen areas. Another unit developed westward along the Abuyog and Baybay roads, and reached the vicinity of Damulaan via Ormoc Bay. This was an attempt to attack the flanks of the Japanese forces' reinforcement units. To counter this, Japanese elite forces, in the heavy encirclement of the enemy American forces, tenaciously defended Mount Catmon, while also tenaciously defending the western highlands of Jaro, Dagami, and Burauen, waiting for an opportunity to prepare to engage in bayonet battles with the enemy Americans in order to crush the enemy's ambition to advance. In the Jaro area, on the night of the 11th, our suicide squad charged in and completely destroyed several enemy American tanks and tractors. There were also other units of our side that penetrated into the enemy American artillery positions on the 8th, 12th, and 13th, instantly destroying many enemy heavy artillery pieces. This kind of tactics actually made the enemy tremble with fear, so the enemy American bombardment of the Ormoc area was greatly reduced. In addition, a fierce counterattack has been launched against the enemy American forces attacking from Damulaan since the 18th, and they are now gradually being forced to the south.</p>
<p>Extremely Intense War Situation</p>
<p>The air annihilation battle that coordinates with such land force combat is a major key to controlling the Leyte battle situation. The current war situation is tragic, fierce, and has reached its peak. It has reached a stage of kill or be killed. The enemy Americans' operation on Leyte Island is a landing battle without air cover. Therefore, when the enemy launched a land battle, they immediately worked hard to repair the occupied airfields of Tacloban, Dulag, and San Pablo in order to allow large numbers of land-based aircraft from New Guinea to arrive. In addition, the mobile unit sent carrier-based aircraft to supplement the shortage of land-based air forces. This was in order to compete for air supremacy over Leyte Island with land-based aircraft and warship aircraft. The number of aircraft in New Guinea under the command of MacWade is about 100 in Hollandia, 300 to 400 each in Biak and Noemfoor, and about 200 in Mair on the north coast of New Guinea, totaling about 1,500 aircraft. They use Palau and Halmahera as relay bases, and transfer to Leyte Island or directly carry out air raids on the southern Philippines. In order to counter these aircraft of the United States, the Japanese air force repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy American bases with a never-ending spirit of daring to die, completely destroying the aircraft that they had painstakingly acquired by bombing. Since October 27th, more than 200 enemy aircraft have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Active Role of Special Attack Units</p>
<p>Japanese Special Attack Units are everywhere striking at the enemy's mobile units, attacking the enemy's maritime power with fearless body-crashing tactics, and destroying the strength of the enemy's carrier-based aircraft. As a result, the enemy's shameless boast of local absolute superiority has been tragically destroyed. At the same time, our Kamikaze Attack Units also carry out long-range air raids on the enemy American rear area bases such as Los Negros Island, Biak, and Mair. An annihilation battle is now being conducted without interruption every day.</p>
<p>Enemy American's Supply Difficulties</p>
<p>Although enemy American ships have been subjected to our continuous bombing, there are still 50 to 60 ships anchored in Leyte Gulf, and every day there are 20 to 30 large transport ships desperately replenishing supplies. The necessary military supplies for an enemy American soldier per month are approximately six tons. If we calculate based on seven divisions of about 100,000 people, then it is necessary to replenish 600,000 tons of military supplies per month. According to enemy American reports, since the landing on Leyte, 500,000 tons of military supplies have been unloaded in three weeks. Since the landing on October 20th, until November 11th, 500,000 tons of supplies were transported, which means that approximately 20,000 tons of goods were transported every day. The enemy Americans transported only 20,000 tons of supplies per day in the operation of landing in Normandy, France, after passing through the Dover Strait, which is only 20 kilometers away. Then, looking at it this way, it is possible to know how the enemy Americans are putting all their efforts into the replenishment for the landing operation on Leyte. The enemy's supply line to Leyte Island is Hawaii, New Caledonia, using Australia as a base, and using Hollandia, Los Negros Island, and Saipan as relay bases, and using Morotai and Palau as forward bases, using a large-scale transport convoy to maintain and enhance the combat power of the supply depot. Palau to Leyte is 2,000 kilometers, Morotai to Leyte is 1,000 kilometers, and from Australia or Hawaii it is more than 10,000 kilometers. Maintaining this long supply line and constantly transporting military supplies to Leyte Island has truly exhausted the enemy Americans.</p>
<p>War is Advantageous to Us</p>
<p>Naturally, the shorter the supply line, the more advantageous the war is to us, which is well-known military common sense. And the Leyte Island, with a long supply line that far exceeds the Dover Strait by dozens of times, is such an unfavorable adventure. If this supply line is cut off by our side, then the American troops landing on Leyte Island can be completely wiped out. The Japanese Special Attack Units use their precious lives to crash into enemy American transport ships, which is a powerful weapon to cut off this supply line. Since October 19th, according to the war results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, our army has sunk or destroyed a total of 73 transport ships of various sizes. If we add in those that are missed, the number would be even more considerable. The enemy, worried about cutting off this maritime supply line, has recently been implementing air replenishment from the Palau Islands using transport aircraft, and 30 large transport aircraft transport munitions and supplies to Leyte every day. Of course, this air supply line is determined by the weather and cannot be said to be good, but the enemy cannot help but use this difficult supply line, which is precisely the spirit with which they are fighting the war. Not only are we Japanese fighting a desperate war, but the enemy Americans are also fighting such a war. (Translated by An from the Yomiuri Hochi of November 20th)</p>

<h3>Stabilizing the Food Supply for the Citizens of This City: Taking Urgent Measures, Secretary-General Wu Delivers an Important Speech</h3>
<p>Recently, the black market price of rice has skyrocketed, drawing attention from all sides. It is reported that Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government has repeatedly consulted with relevant parties and the Municipal Advisory Committee on various emergency measures and is actively preparing for winter relief to assist the poor. In order to understand the truth, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu, who graciously gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Strict Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Rice Merchants</p>
<p>"Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed, and commodity prices have become expensive, threatening the lives of the people and causing social unrest. Although the reasons for this are extremely complex, the hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and the deliberate spreading of rumors by treacherous elements to disturb the public are particularly distressing. I, acting on the orders of Mayor Chen, will not shirk my responsibility during this acting period. I will use all my wisdom and do my best to cope with the situation in order to save it. After negotiations with relevant parties, various measures have been decided: (1) For illegal rice merchants who manipulate rice prices for exorbitant profits, the competent authorities have been ordered to conduct a thorough investigation. If evidence is found, they will be severely punished as a warning to those who harm the people's livelihood. (2) Additional coarse grains will be allocated to benefit the common people, and the Bureau of Goods Allocation has issued a public notice for their sale.</p>
<p>Priority Allocation of Household Rice</p>
<p>(3) After consultation with the Rice Control Association, it has been decided that household rice rations will be given priority. The quantity will remain unchanged. (4) In terms of cost, the price of rationed rice has long exceeded five thousand yuan. However, in order to alleviate the burden on the people and to facilitate the Rice Control Association's procurement of rice, the Municipal Government will maintain the price at five thousand yuan. The difference requires an expenditure of 420 million yuan per month, which the Municipal Government is responsible for raising. Meanwhile, we are seeking assistance from society. Once the plan is implemented, the price of rationed rice can be maintained in the near future. In addition, setting up factories to provide porridge to assist the poor, and opening up sources to suppress rice prices are also being prepared separately, hoping to be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>First-Class Restaurants Prohibited from Selling Rice</p>
<p>What I hope the citizens will pay special attention to is that, firstly, each household should not store more than three months' worth of actual needs. Do not hoard excessively, or you will be punished. Secondly, first-class restaurants in the city were banned from selling rice by the former First District Public Office. This ban remains in effect. Therefore, all such restaurants must strictly abide by the ban and must not privately violate the ban or even purchase and store large quantities of rice under the pretext of making huge profits. If they deliberately violate this, they will be punished. In short, the Municipal Government has a deep understanding of the seriousness of the rice problem. It is my duty to do my best to resolve it as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life can deeply recognize the importance of Shanghai at this stage. We should know that during the war, frugality and solemnity in daily life should be the first priority. If we can attach importance to public interests, restrain personal desires, remain calm and self-possessed, and encourage each other through hardship, all unfounded rumors will naturally disappear, and social stability can be ensured. This is what the citizens of this city should be clearly aware of and encourage each other with.</p>
<p>Improvement of Treatment for Municipal Government Personnel</p>
<p>As for the military, police, and police officers who are responsible for local security, the Municipal Government, in consideration of their livelihood, has increased their salaries by 100% starting in October. The treatment of other staff members of subordinate agencies has also been improved with the addition of allowances. Although a thorough adjustment is still difficult during this period of soaring prices, the Municipal Government's concern for its staff can be universally understood. Officials are public servants of the people, and their every move affects society. In this extraordinary period, I sincerely hope that we can all share the difficulties, invigorate ourselves, and work hard to live up to the expectations of the government and society."</p>
<h3>Ensuring Wartime Security: Implementing Special Criminal Law, Police Authorities Issue Statement</h3>
<p>The police authorities of this city issued the following statement regarding the application of the wartime special criminal law: The National Government promulgated the wartime special criminal law on May 10, 1943. The main purpose of its promulgation is, first, to prevent the dangers of enemy attacks, or the increase in general criminal offenses that can be foreseen during alert periods. Second, to prevent and suppress wartime political prisoners from disrupting order and other acts that disturb social order. Third, to establish a wartime air defense system. Fourth, to protect wartime special production and public utilities. Fifth, to establish a wartime controlled economy, etc., in order to complete the wartime security, maintain the stability of the people's lives, and ensure military needs.</p>
<p>Strengthening Laws to Eliminate Crime</p>
<p>Recently, the war situation has become increasingly severe, and this city has suffered several air raids, directly facing the danger of air raids, or during alert periods. On the one hand, a group of unscrupulous people and reactionary elements are taking the opportunity to commit crimes. On the other hand, a group of immoral profiteers and shameless elements disregard the welfare of the public, disrupt controls and engage in other improper acts, violating wartime special laws. They dare to boldly evade the law, which is extremely hateful. In view of this, it is necessary to strengthen this law. Recently, the authorities have repeatedly clarified the strengthening of economic controls, the establishment of an air defense system, and the suppression of rumors. In order to thoroughly suppress these activities, the comprehensive application of this law and consultations with relevant agencies have been carried out. We will resolutely issue strict orders to strengthen this law in order to maintain the dignity of the law. We hope that the general public will fully understand the intentions of the authorities, exercise self-reflection and self-discipline, and work together to eliminate such crimes.</p>
<p>Heavier Penalties for Ordinary Criminal Offenses</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the content of the wartime special law, some people may not be familiar with it. Here is a brief summary: (1) Ordinary criminal offenses: Among ordinary criminal offenses such as arson, flooding, robbery, rape, assault, indecency, theft, looting, and intimidation, the wartime special criminal law applies during enemy attacks or during alert periods. The penalties are heavier than those of general criminal law, roughly as follows: (1) Arson and flooding (imprisonment for three years or more, or life imprisonment) (2) Rape (imprisonment for five years or more) (3) Assault and indecency (imprisonment for ten years or more, or life imprisonment) (4) Theft (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years) (5) Looting (same as above) (6) Robbery (imprisonment for five years or more) (7) Intimidation (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years).</p>
<p>Regulations on the Punishment of Political Criminals</p>
<p>(2) Special crimes: (1) Political prisoners, disturbing order, and disrupting social order, whether during enemy attacks or during alert periods, are always subject to the wartime special criminal law during wartime. The penalties are heavier than those of the Law on the Maintenance of Security, the Security Police Law, and the Emergency Punishment Order, roughly as follows: (1) Murder for the purpose of changing the national government (death penalty or life imprisonment). Preparations and attempts are also subject to the same punishment. (2) Injury and illegal detention for the purpose of changing the national government (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years) (3) Obstructing gossip (4) Disturbing order (ringleaders imprisonment for ten years or less, accomplices imprisonment for three years or less) (5) Inciting others to violate the law (ringleaders imprisonment for five years or more, accomplices imprisonment for three years or less) (6) Secret societies disobeying orders to dissolve meetings (imprisonment for one year or more, but not more than seven years).</p>
<p>Circumstances of Crimes Related to Air Defense</p>
<p>(2) Crimes related to air defense: (1) Violence and coercion against air defense officials (imprisonment for seven years or less) (2) Harming public air defense (death penalty or life imprisonment), including sending signals to the air, etc. (3) Obstructing important industries and public utilities: (1) Obstructing communications (imprisonment for five years or more, or life imprisonment) (2) Obstructing electricity (same as above) (3) Obstructing national defense industries and important industries for civilian needs (same as above) (4) Obstructing transportation (death penalty or life imprisonment) (5) Damaging waterways (imprisonment for three years or more, but not more than ten years).</p>
<p>Crimes of Disrupting the Economy and Aiding the Enemy</p>
<p>(4) Crimes of disrupting the economy and aiding the enemy: (1) Speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering of military supplies and daily necessities (death penalty or life imprisonment) (2) Selling and buying in unauthorized similar exchanges, disrupting the market (same as above) (3) Government officials protecting the above two crimes (death penalty) (4) Supplying important materials for military or civilian use to the enemy (death penalty or life imprisonment) (5) Importing important materials for military or civilian use from enemy areas without permission (imprisonment for seven years or more, or life imprisonment) (6) Propaganda that hinders the economy (imprisonment for five years or less).</p>
<h3>Increased Price Limits for Cooking Oil and Vegetables</h3>
<p>At the thirteenth review meeting, the Municipal Price Review Committee discussed the case of raising the price limit for cooking oil. The Oil and Grain Control Association submitted the price limit based on the request of oil merchants. At that time, the price was 465 yuan per catty in national currency. It was considered that the requested price limit was almost the same as the black market price. Therefore, it was decided to send a letter to the Oil and Grain Control Association to re-examine it. Now, after careful review by the Oil and Grain Control Association, it replied to the committee. Therefore, it was decided that the price limit for edible oil should be 410 yuan per catty wholesale, and 435 yuan per catty retail. At the same time, the price limit for vegetables in this bureau was also based on the price limit set by the Central Market, and a compromise was made. After review, it was calculated that green vegetables are 59.8 yuan per catty, spinach is 130 yuan per catty, long white radishes are 59 yuan per catty, potatoes are 70 yuan per catty, and fen gan (sweet potato starch noodles) are exactly 480 yuan per catty. It was found that the increase in the price limit for cooking oil was twice the previously set price limit, and the vegetable prices rose sharply in just one week. The reviewed prices also soared step by step, which tended to promote the black market. It is hoped that the evaluation authorities will pay close attention to this.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Obstructing the Transportation of Rice Under 8 Kilograms, Severe Punishment for Manipulation and Profiteering</h3>
<p>The black market price of rice in this city previously soared due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, which shook the people's hearts and threatened the people's livelihood, which was by no means insignificant. After the concerted efforts of all parties, it has slightly fallen back, but has not yet returned to its original level. The Economic Bureau of this city attaches great importance to the approaching Lunar New Year. In particular, the free transportation of rice under 8 kilograms has been clearly stipulated and has not been changed. Anyone who spreads rumors in an attempt to manipulate and profiteer will be severely punished. The counties and districts have also been notified that if there are cases of obstruction and extortion along the way for the transportation of rice under 8 kilograms, the people are allowed to secretly report at any time for punishment. Secret agents have also been sent to the suburbs to investigate. If anyone is found to be manipulating and hoarding, they will be severely punished once verified. Furthermore, increasing agricultural production is a top priority. We are actively proceeding and planning to make full use of all public and private open spaces in this city and encourage citizens to plant coarse grains to replace rice in order to reduce the consumption of white rice. This will benefit both military and civilian food supplies, and the price of rice will not be difficult to fall.</p>
<h3>French Concession Bus to Restore Original Route</h3>
<p>The French Concession Route 22 bus in this city shortened its route from the Bund to Nangyang Road in late last month. Residents in the Xujiahui area felt greatly inconvenienced and jointly petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the company authorities to restore the original route. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to contact the Public Utilities Bureau. Director Ye agreed to summon the person in charge of the French Concession Tram Company to the bureau for talks and ordered the Route 22 bus route to be restored to Tianping Road to facilitate citizens.</p>
<h3>Extension of Deadline for Household Coal Briquettes in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The replenishment sale of household coal briquettes in the Zhabei Xuhua Fang and city center areas was originally scheduled to end today (21st). Due to delays in delivery, the deadline has been extended to the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Completion of Compilation of the Lianbao (Joint Security) District in the Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>After the Baojia (household registration) Office of the Municipal Police Department dispatched personnel to take over the Baojia in the Nanshi District of this city, the Nanshi Office was established. Director Gu also served as the director, and Section Chief Xiao also served as the deputy director. They immediately planned to divide the Nanshi area into general Lianbao according to the Baojia organization in the urban area. The compilation has been completed, dividing it into Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts, with a total of three general Lianbao, thirteen Lianbao, and one hundred and eleven Bao. At the same time, the Baojia will be re-compiled, and the household registration will be cleared. The candidates for Lianbao in each district have also been drafted and will be commissioned by the office. The list is as follows: Yimiao District (General Lianbao Chief) Yao Wenjun, (Deputy) Feng Hanwen, Shao Zhenxiang, Penglai District (General Lianbao Chief) Cheng Hanqing, (Deputy) Wu Xuanting, Zhang Fengqi, Xieqiao District (General Lianbao Chief) Guo Liangyue, (Deputy) Zhang Run'gao, Yang Jiannian.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Implements Winter Defense</h3>
<p>As winter approaches, the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to prevent petty thieves and cunning criminals from becoming active and disrupting local security, has followed its practice of implementing winter defense, stepping up precautions, and dispatching the Police General Team and the Security Police Brigade to patrol and search all districts of the city. In particular, more attention is being paid to secluded streets and alleys. Those with suspicious behavior must be strictly questioned and their residence permits checked. At the same time, hotels, apartments, and other public places are also strictly checked for travelers to prevent criminals from hiding. The Judicial Office also convened a meeting of the heads of the judicial sections of each branch bureau within the day to discuss the winter defense tasks, and Director Li instructed on various necessary measures for winter defense. The Baotian Self-Defense Corps in Nanshi and other districts have also been working in shifts around the clock and assigning positions.</p>
<h3>Health Association Promotes Tuberculosis Prevention Work</h3>
<p>The Chinese Health Association held its annual meeting of directors at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday. The attendees included Chairman Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, directors Yan Fuqing, Chen Binhe, Zhan Peilin, Shi Zhifu, Sun Shouchang, etc. The meeting was chaired by Director Yuan Ludeng, who welcomed the new directors Tang Yuhan, Lin Zhifu, Chu Linsun, and Han Zhengping. Then, Kai Lanting delivered a speech, saying that latent tuberculosis patients are like invisible time bombs, and there must be a place for them to explode. He hoped that everyone would work together to report them, which is a public safety measure. Dr. Yan Fuqing said that the new medicine of the past twenty years is absolutely preventive medicine. The cost of treating one diphtheria patient can prevent as many as sixty-five people. Therefore, the more widespread the prevention work, the more the health of the people will be improved. In any country during wartime, tuberculosis is extremely rampant, so tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations are a top priority. Dr. Chu Linsun said that the more difficult life is, the more prevention is needed. For the sake of saving medicine and personal safety, it is necessary to have an examination. Xie Yingrui, the medical director of the association, said that according to the statistics of X-ray examinations of the anti-tuberculosis loan industry reported by the Xinwen Bao, the incidence of lung disease reached more than 18%, which is a new world record for tuberculosis incidence. Therefore, tuberculosis prevention work is as urgent as putting out a fire. Finally, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying that according to the current extraordinary situation, tuberculosis prevention is as important as air defense. He hoped that all sectors of society would cooperate and support the eradication of latent patients and complete the prevention work, which is the responsibility of public welfare. Then, the association distributed anti-tuberculosis slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<h3>Chengyi Middle and Primary School Implements "Savings Aid Education Movement"</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from all the students of Chengyi Middle School and Primary School yesterday, stating that since the beginning of this semester, they have launched a "Savings Aid Education Movement" with the aim of frugality and helping others. By the end of this month, they have saved 30,000 yuan and have initially recognized a team. They also hope that students from all schools can respond to the call and establish a culture of frugality and righteousness in the student community. The intention is very good and worthy of admiration. The attached origin is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Frugality" and "helping others" are virtues, and they are also one of the twelve goals of our school's student regulations. The so-called: "Strengthen my will, harden my heart, exert my strength, and be frugal in serving myself" means self-restraint and non-extravagance. The so-called: "Helping the poor and rescuing the weak, helping those in need" means using one's strength to benefit others. Being able to restrain oneself and being generous and charitable to the community are all-encompassing actions. Moreover, nowadays everything is expensive, and life is becoming more and more difficult. We are fortunate to be able to continue our studies in this difficult environment. We should take into account the wandering and out-of-school students and provide them with material assistance. Our school has launched a savings aid education movement. Saving can cultivate a style of frugality, and helping education can cultivate a style of righteousness. It is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<p>Savings Aid Education Movement Measures</p>
<p>(1) All students in this school should follow the principle of frugality and self-restraint, save as much as possible, and cultivate a style of simplicity. (2) All students in this school should follow the wish of being charitable and generously help education, and cultivate a style of righteousness. (3) Each week, the students will hand over the saved money to the group leader twice on Tuesdays and Fridays. After registration, the class leader will hand it over to the teaching office, and at the same time, the amount saved by each student will be announced. (4) Every Wednesday and Saturday, the savings and donations of students in each grade will be deposited in the Shanghai Bank, and the total amount of each grade group will be announced to encourage competition. Those with particularly outstanding results will be rewarded. (5) All doubts about savings and donations will be sent by this school to the Shenbao newspaper, and it is proposed that the newspaper will give savings and donation commemorative tickets, divided into red, yellow, and blue colors, with three types of 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan respectively. (6) At the end of a semester, the student with the largest total amount of savings and donations will be rewarded by this school, and the Shenbao newspaper will also determine to give rewards or souvenirs. (7) This method will be supervised and promoted by the teachers of each grade, and the group leaders of each grade will be responsible for handling it. (Note) The newspaper can also handle the method opened in Article 5. However, it is hoped that all schools will promote it together and express their opinions in advance by letter for handling.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Baocun Donates Money to Help Education</p>
<p>Since the special fundraising team of this newspaper has been actively promoting it, Mr. Zhang Baocun responded again yesterday. Mr. Zhang is currently the general manager of CPC Coffee Company and the chairman of the Shanghai Coffee Industry Association. He is young, handsome, and skilled in social affairs. He is enthusiastic about public welfare and is the leader of the industry. CPC coffee has been carefully researched and refined by Mr. Zhang and is very popular in all circles. It is currently popular throughout the country and has received rave reviews.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Baoheng and Xie Yaonan from Yongli Tobacco Raw Materials Company wrote: "Dear Sirs, In view of the urgent need for scholarships, we are willing to donate a total of 60,000 yuan with our colleagues in this company as scholarships. We know that it is only a drop in the bucket, but we hope that enthusiastic people at sea will lend a helping hand and work together to promote this righteous cause, so that the poor students can benefit endlessly."</p>
<h3>The 8th Shenbao Readers' Talent Scholarship Special Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>Team 62 Zhou Guoliang Team 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 63 Chengyi Middle School Savings Aid Education Team 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 64 CPC Team 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 65 Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company Team 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 66 Yilong Team 20,000 yuan</p>

<p>Team 68 Yongli Tobacco Raw Materials Company Colleagues Team 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 69 Quan Baoheng Team 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 70 Xie Yaonan Team 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 71 Huaji Team 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>The above totals 320,000 yuan, for a total of 2,905,025 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huaji Team recognized a team of 100,000 yuan, and Zhang Baocun recognized a team of 50,000 yuan (each new star pharmaceutical factory gave a bottle of deeply loved and invigorating sweat), using its CPC product as the team name, wishing that all manufacturers at sea can use its honorary products to recognize the team and donate money, making it famous far and wide and leaving a lasting memory, which is of great significance. The managers of Yongli Tobacco Company, Quan and Xie, and their colleagues formed three teams, and the labor and management worked together to help education, which is in line with the newspaper's "gathering all" to help education. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial circles will respond enthusiastically, and the merits will be immeasurable. Chengyi Middle School's implementation of the "Savings Aid Education Movement" is a model for all schools. The teachers of this school have such great aspirations, guiding students to be selfless and righteous, which shows that their daily training is effective, and it is respectable and commendable. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Yilong Team, Zhou Zongliang, Tang Shoumin and other gentlemen each recognized a team, enthusiastically supporting and benefiting the poor, which is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>The Pressing Issue of Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Guangyuan</p>
<p>Currently, the issue of commodity prices has become the most serious concern for every citizen in Shanghai. However, the issue of tuition fees has also become the most distressing problem for every parent. This semester has only a little over a month left, and the next semester is fast approaching. Many schools have already unofficially announced the tuition fees for the upcoming semester. Private universities are estimated to be around 40,000 yuan, while middle schools are around 20,000 yuan. We cannot help but express our shock at these figures. Although people generally say that money is worthless, it is not easy to come up with tens of thousands of yuan, especially for middle-class families with many children. What are they supposed to do?</p>
<p>We cannot deny that the private pockets of some principals are swelling up. As a university student, I am willing to use what I have seen and heard to prove that many schools are indeed tuition mills.</p>
<p>(1) The cost per teaching hour for professors is only at a minimum level before the semester begins. After the semester starts, it increases depending on the number of students. But does it really reach the ideal amount? Isn't this just a way of calculating profits?</p>
<p>(2) Some schools require students who have been granted student loans to write a promissory note, stating that they will repay the full amount within a few years after graduation. While loan repayments are necessary, this method seems overly harsh.</p>
<p>(3) School finances, like national finances, should balance income and expenses. However, some schools offer middle school students a 10% discount on tuition fees. From the perspective of a student, what are we supposed to think?</p>
<p>There are countless examples like these. The simplest thing to do is to calculate whether the tuition fees collected by the school are equal to the school's expenses. I think this is perhaps a very serious problem that must be resolved. In my personal opinion, there are three points for discussion:</p>
<p>First, the passive approach would be to ask the principals of the schools to muster their courage. They are all intellectuals and should know the importance of the mission of education, especially wartime education, which is even more critical. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>(1) The school's finances should be completely transparent, with income and expenses balanced.</p>
<p>(2) Students should be allowed to pay tuition fees in installments to alleviate the burden on parents.</p>
<p>(3) A minimum tuition fee may be set. If the budget is later exceeded, students can bear the additional cost, of course with mutual understanding. As long as we reach this point, there will be no more problems.</p>
<p>Second, the active approach would be to ask the relevant authorities to impose sanctions if there are one or two scoundrels in the education sector who are unwilling to give up their source of wealth. Initially, they should be advised with sincere words. If they remain stubborn, force should be used to intervene.</p>
<p>(1) The school's finances should be managed or budgeted by people appointed by the authorities, ensuring that they are simple, honest, and that income and expenses are balanced. The principal or school board should still be given nominal positions and appropriate salaries.</p>
<p>(2) Someone once proposed "capping tuition fees." In fact, in Shanghai today, it may not be impossible to implement this, although it is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Third, a compromise approach. I don't know if this approach is reasonable or whether it will be accepted by society. That is, the school would send people to conduct a thorough investigation of the students' families, determining the tuition fees they should pay based on the students' family circumstances. The goal is to integrate the school and the students. Of course, doing this well is not an easy task, but I think it is not difficult either, as long as there are dedicated people, they will surely succeed.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few contributions to make to the school: the school should minimize expenditure as much as possible, and in addition to minimizing expenditure, it should also increase revenue, in order to reduce the burden on students. For example:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of minimizing expenditure: the students can cooperate to share the work of the staff, and the students can provide their own paper during exams. The paper is not significant, but if the school purchases a large quantity, it is really a big ... etc.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of increasing revenue: in addition to tuition fees, government subsidies, and external fundraising, the school can lead students to engage in productive work based on their strengths, making it a required subject for extracurricular practice (for example, agricultural students can be made to plant crops, etc.) to increase the school's assets, which will also reduce the burden on students.</p>
<p>Although there are many student aid organizations in society now, they are ultimately just a drop in the bucket and do not solve the problem. I hope that the wise authorities will make some changes for the future of Chinese education. This would be fortunate for tens of thousands of students and would also be a policy to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Hongjiu Generously Benefits Orphaned and Impoverished Children</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Hongjiu wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, I pass by every day and see homeless children on the streets, their clothes barely covering their bodies, not having enough to eat, and their suffering is unbearable. These children are no different from ordinary children, but perhaps because their parents have died, there is no one to care for them, or because their families are in difficulty, they are forced to be abandoned. As a result, their innocence has not faded, but they have become wandering beggars. This kind of miserable scene is unbearable to witness. Your organization's aid for impoverished children aims to rescue and educate orphans and homeless children, providing them with appropriate education so that they can become useful people. The method is good and the intention is kind, which touches my heart. I am enclosing a check for 10,000 yuan, hoping that you will accept it and allocate it to the aid for impoverished children. The amount is small, but it expresses my sincere intentions." Mr. Hongjiu's enthusiasm for charity and his generosity towards impoverished children are truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Widespread Benevolence</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Youqing, seeing that it has been cold and freezing recently, with many corpses on the streets, and that rice, fuel, and charities are finding it particularly difficult to provide supplies, deeply moved by the difficulties of the times. He made a grand vow to solicit 40,000 yuan each from Wenkunfang and Chen Jiqing Hall, totaling 80,000 yuan, and donated 40,000 yuan in the name of the above-mentioned organizations to this organization for winter relief expenses, and another 20,000 yuan each to Xin Puyu Hall and the Holy Mother's Infant Care Center, totaling the above amount. His benevolence and righteous deeds are truly admirable.</p>
<p>Also, the two children, Ying Chun and Gao Chun, go to school every morning, braving the bitter wind, their fingers and skin chapped. They deeply feel that the poor have no clothes or food, how can they get through the year? They specially prepared 200 yuan from their savings to be used as expenses. The two children, feeling and empathizing with their own hunger, practice thrift and provide assistance. Their determination is commendable. It is hoped that influential people from all walks of life will rise up and respond. This is truly unparalleled merit.</p>

<h3>Chinese Children's Welfare Association Solicits Christmas Gifts</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association received donations from all walks of life in the past two days, totaling more than 180,000 yuan, including 150,000 yuan solicited by Mr. Ding Boxiong. Mr. Ding is a standing committee member of the association and has now solicited a total of 309,000 yuan. He is known for his enthusiasm in promoting active social welfare work and is particularly concerned about children's education. According to Mr. Ding, the association originally set a fundraising target of 5 million yuan, which would be sufficient for half a year's expenses. However, given the current commodity price situation, it would be difficult to maintain without raising at least 10 million yuan. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will work together to continue to assist in fundraising so that the association's fundraising can be successfully concluded.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to increase children's interest as Christmas is approaching, the association has decided to hold celebrations at the Orphanage and the Children's Welfare Institute on the 24th and 25th of this month, respectively. The students will perform recreational programs, and ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life are welcome to visit. If you would like to donate gifts, such as candy, biscuits, towels, pencils, etc., please send them to the association's office at 208 Zhonghui Building, Dashanghai Road before the 24th, so that they can be distributed.</p>
