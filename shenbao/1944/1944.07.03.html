<h3 id="c1">社評　積極的創造 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>人生是一個大奮鬥，人類的責任就在不斷的創造，永久的進化。現在，全世界都在戰爭中，全人類都受到戰爭的影響，國家要獲取獨立自由，民族要獲取永久生存，都要積極的創造。這個積極創造的使命，是大時代下，每個國民緻負的責任。</p>
<p>創造不是一件空口說白話的事情，創造要拿出事實的成就來表現，所以，積極的創遭就是積極的工作。在嫉妒緊張的局勢下，沒有一個國民可以免除工作的義務。譬如盟邦織本，全國國民，不論男女老幼，不論職業界限，大家都得雜適當的本位上勤勉勞動。在生產工作傾力重大政策之下，各重點事業如煤，鐵，輕金屬，船舶，飛機等等均有最高的成績，最新的創造。推其原因，根本都由於努力工作，在平時，一個國民的不工作僅僅影響他個人的升級；在戰時，一個國民的不工作可以影響到整個國力。政府因此的前途亦必願織為國家工作，更願紙加多工作。（盟邦日本各機關的廢止星期休息，更是增加工作的表示。）有積極工作的精神然後能產生創造的新成績。</p>
<p>創造不是一件容易的事情，愛迪生說過，他的發明，百分之九十九是血汗，百分之一是靈感，所以創造是一件費精神，費時間，刻苦耐勞勉力成功的事。在創造的途徑上有無數皺州關，有決心有勇氣的人能够一重一重的打破，能夠耐勞耐苦的人然後受得住治水是一個最好的榜樣，孟子稱禹八年於外，三過家門不入，墨子稱禹腓無胈，脛無毛艱難，卒能創造中國歷史上最最偉大的成績。凡是創造必須和困難奮鬥，這是人類史上的定理，歷史上的事實證明更舉不勝舉。現在正是大時代，丈東亞戰爭更是創週的時期，使世界歷史有一個劃時代的轉變，大東亞民族都負　創造新生命的責任，戰爭的難關還是很多，負著創造使命的人學大禹的精神神，一步一步去克服他，大禹的治水是中國從水患中解救出來，成功一個國家，大東亞戰爭使中國從英美的壓迫食糧下解放出來，成功一個獨立自由的國家，我們要創造一個永久獨立自由的中國，我們就得要用全國國民的血汗去努力奮門。</p>
<p>創鐘新世界是我中的使命，認定工作，埋頭苦幹是創造的方法。凡是不工作，不耐苦的人不能夠創造，爲人類所不齒，自然地要趨於滅亡·肯工作，肯吃苦的人，勇往直敬，替國家民族立定永久不拔的基礎。孰去孰從，願我國民猛省。</p>
<h3 id="c2">德國的新兵器　無人飛機　流星炸彈　老虎戰車 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>反軸心軍濫炸德國各城市，並發動侵歐登陸戰後，德國爲報復計，使用種種神秘武器，使敵人大為震恐，其中威力最大的，便是所謂「無人飛機」。</p>
<p>英國最初發現無人飛機在本年一月十四日夜，是夜倫敦市內及郊外，忽然飛來巨型作彈多枚，釀成重大損害，受此意外打擊，市內頗呈混亂狀態。原來英國在英法海峽方面，佈置着嚴密的空製監視網，但當時對於來襲的德機，竟毫無知覺，因此英國軍事觀察家紛紛揣測，以為德國使用無織最機，發射流星作彈。</p>
<h3 id="c3">炸彈五光十色 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>據本年三月初英國「每日郵報」所載德軍在義大利妝綫所用的無綫電操縐竹彈，謂：「該項炸彈發射片刻，尾翼現出亮光，蓋恐視綫不佳時，無綫電難以控制。此種紅黃或白色的亮光，如流星一般，光彩四射，滑向皂中，作彈近地時，火花飛散，恰如雨下，其爆炸力强大，德軍非在特殊作肢時，不輜易使甩。」</p>
<p>英國方面想像中的無人飛機，全長九呎，翼闊十呎，軍體的尖端，與普通德國作彈相同，眾體後半部則有受電裝置州並有飛機的昇降舵，關節用的織電器等設備。翼幅短，眞弦廣裝有輔助翼，此項無人飛機，平常吊在母機體下，待接近目標。即行放射，利用無綫電控制，命中目標。無人飛機驅體下面，裝有火箭式的動力機，噴射性瓦斯，向後徐徐噴射。母織還離目標，保持六百乃至千二百公尺高度，在目標所在的都巿與艦船等高射砲射程所不及之處，操縱無人乘機。</p>
<p>德國自六月十五日以來利用此種無人飛機，向英國本部沿岸自倫敦至勃萊斯托爾八萬平方公里區找，施行猛炸。倫敦各處起火·吳國嚴大的軍　工廠烏利基兵工廠亦中彈起火。英國的防空陣動員數十萬人，利用照明彈與高射炮，拼命防守。至六月十九日，德國當局宜佈：「德軍對於倫敦及北法南部用新兵器「達那瑪特洗星」，加以攻擊，距諾曼第戰塲不達，新兵器即將出現。」英噪方面聞之益加震恐。（譯自六月十八日及二十日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c4">虎戰車的威力 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>邀擊英美西歐上陸軍的德軍機械化部隊，其威力已有定評，茲將為其主力的重戰車解說一下。</p>
<p>對於圖在克恩地區建立橋頭堡的反軸心上陸軍，倫西台特將軍麾下的德軍，以精銳的機械化部隊…即由趙重戰車和重戰車組成的機械化師團…</p>
<p>這次大戰初起時，德軍由於使用戰車的集團，在波蘭戰線，法蘭西戰綫獲得了閃電的勝利。</p>
<p>由東部戰綫的珍資體騐而產生的，便是德軍的强力重職軍「虎」　說它的重量計有六十噸。虎戰車的特色是裝甲很厚。它備有粉碎敵軍重戰車的銳利武器，即口徑八·八生的，砲身之長達四米八四以上的加農砲。這樣長的砲身，和車體比終起來，是很不相稱的。</p>
<p>蓋自一九四〇年以來，各國職車的裝甲日益加厚，美國和蘇聯的重戰車，其砲專和主要部分都是用一八公分或二〇公分的防彈籌鋼造成的。要皺透此種鋼板，彈速必須大，因此德國就用砲身很長的加農砲。</p>
<p>此種重戰車的作戰織標，是在擊破英美上睦的戰軍羣，殲滅企圖建立橋頭堡的英美軍於海岸地帶。據傳進出克恩地區的德國機機化部隊中並有超置戰車出現，至其奘備，從美國M二一自行砲備有十五生的榴彈砲這點看來，至少搭載着十五生的加農砲。</p>
<p>不過，這些超重戰車的車體很重，製造能夠負　這個重量並能耐受不平地面的衝擊的無限軌道，未被解決，則機械化師團的主力大概還是六十噸級的重戰車虎做軍。</p>
<p>此次大戰初期，德軍在西皺塲集結四萬五千輛的戰車汽車，突破英法眾的中央，演出鄧扣克的悲劇。以虎戰車為主力的機械化師團，也能樹下很大的戰果吧。（六月十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c5">塞班島日軍奮戰頓尼高地固守中日機再襲阿斯利特敵機場 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日軍某基地二日中央社電　塞班島日美之決戰愈演愈烈，敵軍　龐大物量，於大砲掩護下，不分　夜進攻日軍陣地，日軍刻仍以孤軍奮戰中　周時並實施勇敢夜襲，致使敵受創頗重。尼米　司令部二十一日曾發表謂：自美軍開始登陸以來，美軍已損失九千七百五十二名，此損失數字較達拉瓦之損失達三倍以上。塔保喬山西南方高地方面，大者中尉所率領之部隊自廿三日至廿六日。曾擊毀敵追擊砲六門及照朋班八縱（兵力約百二十名）　六日大　中尉率餌下十四名組織挺身隊，曾於敵綫突破敵警戒線，並夜襲設於該高地周旋之敵軍指揮所，當擊潰敵守備兵百五十名，並將該所覆滅。又美軍爲補償登陸後之大損失，特增援大量坦克車，企圖突破頓尼西方高地之日軍第一終，迄未得逞。廿八日在該方面擊毀敵坦克車五輛及大砲三門，是故敵眾欲向織尼以北前進之企圖，已成泡影。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地二日電：日機隊曾於一日夜再度飛襲塞班島阿斯利特敵機場甲乙痛炸，將停置於地上之敵機五架炸毀。又敵軍事設施九處中彈，發生大火，是日另一隊日機並曾轟炸塞班島方面之敵艦船。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地電：在瑪利亞納羣島面方海面哨戒中之日軍偵察機，於一日白畫曾在該海域發現敵潛艇，當即以機艙猛烈掃射，予以重創。</p>
<h3 id="c6">日軍由三方面　攻擊衡陽市街　以重炮轟襲軍事設施 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　日軍各部隊已將衡陽東方之渝軍機塲收歸掌握，刻正猛攻據寸衡陽市街，作最後抵抗之愈軍。渝軍委會一日發表戰况公報，謂衡陽郊外仍作惡門，日軍得有力部隊增援，不斷以重轟擊衡陽街巿之軍事設施，刻日軍步兵部隊自南西北三方面，對衡陽開始攻擊，尤以西南郊外之攻擊最為熾烈。日軍巳由數處突入衡陽市街防禦綫，渝軍損失甚鉅，刻日軍仍在積極進攻中。</p>
<h3 id="c7">日軍沿粵漢綫南進 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　只軍沿粤漢鐵路自北而南，迅速前進，刻已開抵衡陽。另一部日軍，則已越過衡陽，再沿鐵路南進，於是長達二千公里，連結武昌廣州市之粵漢，鐵路，泰半爲日軍控制。按衡陽爲粵漢鐵路中部要衡，失去衡陽，不　失去整個粵漢路，最近渝方已不得不承認其重要矣。美國通信亦一齊評述衡陽之眾要，並謂日軍即將打通夸漢路，廿三日之合衆社皺慶電，曾報吿謂，日眾於五月廿七日開始湖南作戰，僅四星期，即前進二百五十公里，由岳陽殺至衡山，刻下衡山至詔關間長三百公里之粵漢路，尚在遇見掌握中。渝方有　者，均推測日眾將更自衡關南進，以打通粵漢路，　四日路透社重慶電亦報吿，日本把握衡陽再向南進，則咨漢路即全為日軍控制，目下情勢實不容樂觀。廿八日美聯重慶社電，曾摘錄渝軍委員會軍令部次長劉為章，在掃蕩報發表之論文如次：日軍之企圖打通粤漢綫，已定而無疑，打通粵漢綫，故有相當困難，但此舉將使渝方愈益窮困，是日美聯社電，更摘錄中國時報之社論如次。日軍不久將打通粤漢綫，此舉若能實現，當可謂日軍已達到發後目的。由此可見渝方均認為日方在謀打通粤漢綫云。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日軍擊落美機多架 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>湖南日軍前綫二日中央社電　湖南方面駐渝美空軍之蠢動，及與日軍地上部隊之交戰，現正日益激烈。如上月二十七日，在　陵東南方，美機即會與日軍地上部隊展開決戰，當時交緻未幾，即有兩架被日軍鑿洛，緣是日正午時，日軍正於醴陵東南方推進時，突有美P40型機十三架出現，並連續作俯衝掃射，地上日軍亦立即一齊以舟槍還擊。一瞬之間，即有一架兩翼巾彈，黑烟祖冒，墜落終該地前方之山上。另一架亦中彈冒烟，隊於附近河中，計其時間作有五分鐘</p>
<h3 id="c9">渝軍遭受　殲滅打擊 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>湖南日軍前綫二日中央社電　日軍都隊十四日攻陷株州後，於株州淥口閒包圍由該地敗退之渝暫編第二軍，予以澈底殲滅。此役淪暫編第八師長甘鏡生，於綠口附近陣亡，此外並有渝軍高級幹部三百二十餘人陣亡，（其中校官約二十餘人），巳使渝暫編第二軍遭受殲滅打擊。按渝暫編第二軍，為薛岳之直系眾，為渝第九戰區之幹部。</p>
<h3 id="c10">湘日軍攻略戰完成 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>湖南前綫日軍某電某基地二日中央社電　日軍在長沙之攻略戰，實屬戰史上鮮有之成功。當攻略戰開始之時，日軍舟艇部隊沿湘江溯行，突破渝眾敷成之機當，同時因舟艇部隊奮戰？使岳麓山下砲兵部隊亦勇往進攻，故舟艇成為作戰軍之立足點，在後方則有補給重任。蓋，幷以連日陰雨，路途泥佞難行，炮兵部隊僅能改由水路挺進。但水路上淪軍亦已敷設水曾，航行至為危險，然而日軍舟艇部隊澤井大尉，親率十二艘天馬船，向長沙水路挺進，其中數艘已觸水雷，登時被毀，而澤幷隊長，即以桌彈予之突擊，結果完成偉天之水雷突証戰。於是砲兵都隊即織目的地登陸，而壓制渝軍山麓陣地。再舟艇部隊之奮戰尙不幟在此一點，對於勞古之補給任務，尤樹偉大功動。如此次作戰之補給，全由水路進行，然因淪機不斷偵察，織送自非易事。且因船隻不足，而動員數千民船，嗣後幸得中國民眾之協助，分擔輪送責任，始獲非常成功。在此輸送任務內，民船即在渝機轟炸下，完成使命。</p>
<h3 id="c11">緬甸傾舉全力　協助大東亞戰 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>東京二織中央社電　日駐緬甸大使館參事官北澤氏，為接洽要務，於六月廿四日來此。一日午後會會見大東亞記者團，叙述緬甸之現狀如次：巴莫國家代表之政治力量，至今已參透全緬各地，並已具備指導者之實質。緬甸政府至今難僅成立一年，組織內容之充實，已相當驚人，各部長以下各官長忠於職守之情形，已為本人所目睹。現緬甸國內之裝重要問題，在求民生之安定，尤其對食糧及日用雜貨之確保，為此關係，緬甸政府已計劃與日本絕對提携。八月）日為織甸獨立一週年紀念。緬甸政府巳預定盛大宣傳，提倡開發運動，同時於十一月中在曼德勒莫爾門等各地舉行日本小工業展覽會及演習會，並己得大狀省之贊助，將自日本派遣二十餘人往該地舉辦一切。又緬甸之對日協力，刻正由各方面努力推進中，尤其於軍事方面協力更極顯著，現在巳供出的八十萬之勞動者，晝夜協力日軍工作。又巴莫國家代表與自由印度中席鮑斯氏頗友善，巴莫代表曾謂，無印度之獨立，即無緬甸之　立，由此亦可知兩氏關係之親近矣。</p>

<p>浦東高廟碼頭黃浦江內，於六月二十六日清晨發生渡船傾覆溺斃乘客慘案，已誌本報。按浦江一小船，偶遭滅頂，傷生者亦做十餘人，似一瑣圳之事，但値得論列者其故有三：</p>
<p>查該船為一本質小艇，專在該碼頭搖渡裕豐紗廠工人，但並未領得公用局浦江許可　，且不加入濟渡業公會，是乃一不合法之渡船也明甚。懼氈無官廳許可證而竟在浦江渡客，且專以搖渡工人過浦為業，當非偶一為之。何以主管機關竟迄未發覺，或已發覺而竟在某種條件之下加以默許，一者必居其一。可見船主膽敢矇蔽狼狽，肆無忌憚，馴致載客逾重，亦無人過問，坐管機關實不能卸其責任。</p>
<p>乘客登船爭先恐後，在渡船尙未停妥，巳擁摘不堪，船主深恐肇禍，乃急將該船駛離埠頭，而乘客等未及坐定，又復載重渝限，致失去平衡，遂遭傾覆。試思當時之情形，其雜沓紛亂，可想而知。乘客不守秩序，更不知同舟共濟之利害，則其遭滅頂喪生之禍，亦難自辭其咎。</p>
<p>旣具有上述二重內在之缺陷，又復適值高潮水洗湍急，於是釀成慘案，無所逃遁。回憶去年十二月九日華寨輪之於新港失事，其事熊輕重與此容或稍異，而慘案之主因則如出一轍。須知交通事業尤其在客運方面，首重安全，而安全之保證，實由主管機關以及執事人員與乘客三者共同負責。死者不可生，往者不可追，惟盼一再經受深刻敎訓之餘，各自嚴加警惕，以杜後患。</p>
<p>事無鉅細，其理則一，凡官廳放棄職守之國家，羣眾擾　爭奪之社會，在外來驚套惡浪之中，其不同歸於盡者幾希。高廟碼頭渡船之慘案，乃在華泰輪失事之後，又一縮影之例示，毋以其瑣細而忽視之！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: Active Creation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Life is a great struggle, and humanity's responsibility lies in continuous creation and perpetual evolution. Currently, the whole world is at war, and all of humanity is affected by war. If a nation wants to gain independence and freedom, and a people want to secure perpetual survival, they must actively create. This mission of active creation is the responsibility that every citizen bears in this great era.</p>
<p>Creation is not just empty talk; it requires tangible achievements to demonstrate. Therefore, active creation means active work. In the current tense situation, no citizen can be exempt from the duty to work. For example, in the Allied nations, all citizens, regardless of gender, age, or occupational boundaries, must diligently labor in their proper positions. Under the major policy of prioritizing production, key industries such as coal, iron, light metals, shipbuilding, and aircraft have achieved the highest results and the newest creations. The fundamental reason for this is diligent work. In peacetime, a citizen's failure to work only affects their personal advancement; in wartime, a citizen's failure to work can affect the entire national strength. Therefore, the government must be willing to weave (織) [a typo for 視, regard] working for the country as its future, and even more willing to add more work. (The Allied nations, such as Japan, abolishing Sunday rest for all institutions is a further expression of increasing work.) Only with the spirit of active work can new creative achievements be produced.</p>
<p>Creation is not an easy task. Edison said that his inventions were 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. Therefore, creation is a painstaking, time-consuming, and enduring endeavor that requires hard work to succeed. On the path of creation, there are countless difficulties. People with determination and courage can break through them one by one. Only those who can endure hardship can withstand it. Yu the Great's flood control is the best example. Mencius said that Yu was away for eight years, passing his home three times without entering. Mozi said that Yu's calves had no flesh and his shins had no hair. Despite these hardships, he was eventually able to create the most magnificent achievement in Chinese history. All creation must struggle with difficulties; this is a theorem of human history, and historical facts provide countless examples. Now is a great era, and the Greater East Asia War is even more of a period of creation. It will bring about an epoch-making transformation in world history, and the Greater East Asian nations bear the responsibility of creating new life. There are still many difficulties in the war. Those who bear the mission of creation must learn from the spirit of Yu the Great and overcome them step by step. Yu's flood control liberated China from the scourge of floods and established a country. The Greater East Asia War will liberate China from the oppression of Britain and the United States and establish an independent and free nation. If we want to create a permanently independent and free China, we must use the blood and sweat of all our citizens to strive diligently.</p>
<p>Creating a new world is our mission. Identifying work and burying oneself in hard work are the methods of creation. Those who do not work and cannot endure hardship cannot create and will be despised by humanity and will naturally tend toward extinction. Those who are willing to work and endure hardship, advance bravely and respectfully, and establish a permanent and unshakable foundation for the nation and the people. Which to choose, may our citizens deeply reflect.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Germany's New Weapons: Unmanned Aircraft, Meteor Bombs, Tiger Tanks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>After the anti-Axis forces indiscriminately bombed German cities and launched an invasion of Europe, Germany, in retaliation, used various mysterious weapons that greatly terrified the enemy. Among them, the most powerful were the so-called "unmanned aircraft."</p>
<p>Britain first discovered unmanned aircraft on the night of January 14 of this year. On that night, several giant bombs suddenly flew over London and its suburbs, causing significant damage. Affected by this unexpected blow, the city was in a state of considerable chaos. Originally, Britain had established a dense air control surveillance network in the English Channel, but at that time, it was completely unaware of the attacking German aircraft. Therefore, British military observers speculated that Germany was using unmanned aircraft to launch meteor bombs.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Bombs of Various Colors <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>According to the British "Daily Mail" in early March of this year, regarding the radio-controlled bombs used by the German army on the Italian front line, it stated: "The tail of the bomb shows a bright light for a moment after launch, probably for ease of radio control when visibility is poor. This red, yellow, or white light, like a shooting star, radiates brightly and glides toward [皂中, literally 'soap center,' possibly a typo for '目標', the target]. When the bomb is near the ground, sparks scatter, like rain. Its explosive power is strong, and the German army does not easily use it except in special combat situations."</p>
<p>The unmanned aircraft imagined by the British side is nine feet long and ten feet wide. The tip of the body is the same as ordinary German bombs. The rear half of the body has a receiving device [州, likely a typo] and aircraft elevators. The electrical equipment used for joints. The wingspan is short, and the true chord is wide and equipped with auxiliary wings. This unmanned aircraft is usually hung under the body of the mother aircraft. It waits until it approaches the target, then it is launched and uses radio control to hit the target. Under the body of the unmanned aircraft is a rocket-type engine that slowly injects propellant gas backward. The mother aircraft stays away from the target, maintaining an altitude of 600 to 1200 meters, manipulating the unmanned aircraft in places where high-altitude guns cannot reach, such as the target city and ships.</p>
<p>Since June 15, Germany has used this type of unmanned aircraft to bomb the coastal area of the British mainland from London to Bristol, an area of 80,000 square kilometers. Fires broke out everywhere in London. The vast British military factory, Woolwich Arsenal, was also hit and caught fire. The British air defense mobilized hundreds of thousands of people, using flares and anti-aircraft guns to defend desperately. On June 19, the German authorities announced: "The German army is attacking London and southern France with a new weapon called 'Danamat Washing Star'. It is not far from the Normandy battlefield, and the new weapon will soon appear." The British side was even more terrified when they heard this. (Translated from the June 18th and 20th issues of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Power of the Tiger Tank <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The German mechanized units intercepting the Anglo-American landing forces in Western Europe have a well-established reputation for their power. Here is an explanation of the heavy tanks that are their mainstay.</p>
<p>For the anti-Axis landing forces attempting to establish a bridgehead in the Caen area, the German forces under General Rundstedt, with their elite mechanized units... that is, mechanized divisions composed of heavy tanks and heavy tanks...</p>
<p>At the beginning of this great war, the German army achieved lightning victories on the Polish and French fronts by using tank groups.</p>
<p>The German army's powerful heavy tank "Tiger" was born from the valuable experience of the Eastern Front. It weighs 60 tons. The Tiger tank is characterized by its thick armor. It is equipped with a sharp weapon that can crush enemy heavy tanks, namely a cannon with a caliber of 8.8 cm and a barrel length of more than 4.84 meters. Such a long barrel is very disproportionate compared to the vehicle body.</p>
<p>Since 1940, the armor of tanks in various countries has become increasingly thick. The cannons and main parts of American and Soviet heavy tanks are made of 18 cm or 20 cm bulletproof steel. To penetrate this kind of steel plate, the muzzle velocity must be high, so Germany used cannons with very long barrels.</p>
<p>The operational objective of this heavy tank is to defeat the Anglo-American landing forces and annihilate the Anglo-American forces attempting to establish a bridgehead in the coastal area. It is said that super-heavy tanks have appeared in the German mechanized units advancing and retreating in the Caen area. Judging from the fact that the American M21 self-propelled gun is equipped with a 15 cm howitzer, it is at least equipped with a 15 cm cannon.</p>
<p>However, the vehicle body of these super-heavy tanks is very heavy. If the problem of manufacturing endless tracks that can withstand this weight and withstand the impact of uneven ground is not resolved, then the mainstay of the mechanized division will probably still be the 60-ton Tiger heavy tank.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this great war, the German army gathered 45,000 tanks and automobiles in the Western battlefield, breaking through the center of the Anglo-French forces and staging the tragedy of Dunkirk. Mechanized divisions with Tiger tanks as their mainstay will also be able to achieve great combat results. (June 10 Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely on Saipan, Tennyo Highlands Are Strongly Defended, Japanese Planes Attack Aslito Enemy Airfield Again <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The decisive battle between Japanese and American forces on Saipan Island is intensifying. Relying on massive amounts of material and under the cover of artillery, enemy troops are attacking Japanese positions day and night. Japanese troops are still fighting alone [孤軍奮戰] and bravely carry out night attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 21st that since the US military began landing, it has lost 9,752 men. This loss is more than three times the loss at Tarawa. From the 23rd to the 26th, the unit led by Lieutenant Otake in the high ground southwest of Mount Tapochau destroyed six enemy pursuit guns and eight platoons of soldiers (approximately 120 men). On the 26th, Lieutenant Otake led a suicide squad of 14 men, broke through the enemy lines, bypassed the enemy defense lines, and attacked the enemy command post located around the high ground, defeating 150 enemy guards and destroying the command post. In addition, in order to compensate for the heavy losses after landing, the US military reinforced a large number of tanks, attempting to break through the Japanese First Platoon on the western high ground of Mount Tennyo, but failed. On the 28th, five enemy tanks and three artillery pieces were destroyed in this area, so the enemy's attempt to advance north of Mount Tennyo has become a bubble.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. A certain Japanese army base in the central Pacific, Second Day Telegram: Japanese aircraft formations attacked Aslito enemy airfield on Saipan Island again on the night of the first day and bombed it severely, destroying five enemy aircraft parked on the ground. In addition, nine enemy military facilities were hit, causing a major fire. On the same day, another formation of Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy ships off Saipan Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. A certain Japanese army base in the central Pacific Telegram: A Japanese reconnaissance plane patrolling the sea off the Mariana Islands discovered an enemy submarine in the area on the first day of daylight. It immediately fired fiercely from its machine guns, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Troops Attack Hengyang City from Three Directions, Military Facilities Bombarded with Heavy Artillery <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese troops have taken control of the Chongqing army airfield east of Hengyang and are now fiercely attacking the remaining Chongqing troops entrenched in Hengyang city, making a final resistance. The Chongqing Military Commission issued a war situation communiqué on the first day, stating that fierce fighting is still taking place in the suburbs of Hengyang. With reinforcements from powerful units, Japanese troops are constantly bombarding military facilities in Hengyang city with heavy artillery. Japanese infantry units have begun attacking Hengyang from the south, north, and west, with the most intense attacks occurring in the southwestern suburbs. Japanese troops have broken into the Hengyang city defense line in several places, and Chongqing troops have suffered heavy losses. Japanese troops are still actively attacking.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Troops Advance Southward Along the Yuehan Line <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Japanese troops are advancing rapidly southward along the Yuehan Railway from the north and have now reached Hengyang. Another unit of Japanese troops has crossed Hengyang and is continuing to advance southward along the railway. As a result, most of the Yuehan Railway, which stretches 2,000 kilometers and connects Wuchang and Guangzhou, is under Japanese control. Hengyang is a key point in the central section of the Yuehan Railway. Losing Hengyang means losing not only the entire Yuehan Railway. Recently, the Chongqing side has had to admit its importance. American news agencies have also commented on the importance of Hengyang, saying that the Japanese army is about to open up the Yuehan Line. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 23rd reported that the Japanese army began its Hunan campaign on May 27 and advanced 250 kilometers in just four weeks, advancing from Yueyang to Hengshan. Currently, 300 kilometers of the Yuehan Line between Hengshan and Shaoguan is still in the Chongqing [遇見, likely a typo for 渝方, Chongqing] 's control. Chongqing [有　者, likely a typo for 有識者, knowledgeable people] speculate that the Japanese troops will further advance southward from Hengguan to open up the Yuehan Line. A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 24th also reported that if Japan seizes Hengyang and continues to advance southward, the entire Yuehan Line will be under Japanese control. The current situation is not optimistic. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 28th excerpted an essay published by Liu Weizhang, Deputy Minister of the Military Command Department of the Chongqing Military Commission, in the Saodang Newspaper as follows: "The Japanese army's attempt to open up the Yuehan Line is certain and undoubted. Opening up the Yuehan Line will be quite difficult, but this move will make Chongqing even poorer." On the same day, an Associated Press dispatch excerpted an editorial from the China Times as follows: "The Japanese army will soon open up the Yuehan Line. If this move can be realized, it can be said that the Japanese army has achieved its purpose." From this, it can be seen that Chongqing believes that Japan is planning to open up the Yuehan Line.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Troops Shoot Down Many American Planes <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Japanese Army Front Line, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The activities of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing in Hunan and its battles with Japanese ground units are now intensifying. For example, on the 27th of last month, American planes engaged in a decisive battle with Japanese ground units southeast of Liling. During the battle, two planes were shot down by Japanese troops. At noon on that day, 13 American P-40s appeared while Japanese troops were advancing southeast of Liling and continuously strafed the ground. Japanese troops immediately returned fire with rifles. In an instant, one plane had both wings hit, black smoke billowed, and it crashed into the mountain in front of the area. Another plane was also hit and smoking, and it crashed into a nearby river. The entire engagement lasted five minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Chongqing Troops Suffer Annihilating Blow <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Japanese Army Front Line, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. After capturing Zhuzhou on the 14th, Japanese troops surrounded the Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army, which was retreating from the area, near Lukou in Zhuzhou and completely annihilated it. In this battle, Gan Jingsheng, commander of the Provisional 8th Division of Chongqing, was killed in action near Lukou. In addition, more than 320 senior Chongqing army officers (including approximately 20 field officers) were killed in action, causing the Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army to suffer an annihilating blow. The Chongqing Provisional 2nd Army is a direct line army of Xue Yue and is the core force of the Chongqing 9th War Zone.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Xiang Japanese Army Completes Capture Strategy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Unit on the Hunan Front Line, A Certain Base, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The Japanese army's capture strategy of Changsha was a rare success in military history. At the beginning of the capture strategy, the Japanese army's boat unit sailed upstream along the Xiang River, breaking through the obstacles laid by the Chongqing army. At the same time, thanks to the boat unit's brave fighting? the artillery unit under Yuelu Mountain also advanced bravely. Therefore, the boats became the foothold of the combat army and bore the important task of supplying the rear. Moreover, due to continuous rainy days, the roads were muddy and difficult to travel, and the artillery unit could only advance by water. However, the Chongqing army had also laid underwater mines on the waterways, making navigation extremely dangerous. However, Captain Sawai of the Japanese army's boat unit personally led twelve Tenma boats and advanced along the waterway to Changsha. Several of them hit underwater mines and were destroyed immediately, but Captain Sawai's team immediately launched a torpedo attack, resulting in the completion of the great feat of breaking through underwater mines. As a result, the artillery unit landed at its destination and suppressed the Chongqing army's mountain positions. Furthermore, the boat unit's brave fighting was not limited to this point. It also made great contributions to the logistical support of the army. The supply for this operation was carried out entirely by water, but it was not easy to do so because enemy planes were constantly scouting. Moreover, due to a shortage of ships, thousands of civilian ships were mobilized. Fortunately, with the assistance of the Chinese people, who shared the responsibility of transporting supplies, it was a great success. In this transport mission, the civilian ships completed their mission under the bombing of Chongqing planes.</p>

<p>Tokyo, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Mr. Kitazawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Myanmar, came here on June 24 to discuss important matters. On the afternoon of the first day, he met with the Greater East Asia Press Corps and described the current situation in Myanmar as follows: The political power of the Ba Maw National Representative has now penetrated all parts of Myanmar and has the substance of a leader. The Myanmar government has only been established for a year, but the enrichment of its organizational content is quite amazing. I have witnessed the situation of all ministers and officials faithfully performing their duties. The most important problem in Myanmar now is to seek the stability of people's livelihoods, especially to ensure food and daily necessities. For this relationship, the Myanmar government plans to absolutely cooperate with Japan. August (sic) is the first anniversary of Myanmar's independence. The Myanmar government has scheduled a grand publicity campaign to promote development activities. At the same time, a Japanese small industrial exhibition and training session will be held in Mandalay and other places in November, and has obtained the sponsorship of the Ministry of State Affairs and will dispatch more than 20 people from Japan to organize everything there. In addition, Myanmar's cooperation with Japan is being actively promoted in all aspects, especially in the military aspect. Currently, 800,000 laborers have been provided and are working day and night with the Japanese army. Furthermore, Ba Maw, the National Representative, is quite friendly with Bose, the head of Free India. Representative Ba Maw once said that without India's independence, there would be no Myanmar's independence. From this, it can be seen the closeness of the relationship between the two.</p>

<p>Zurich, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. The battle in the northern part of the Cherbourg Peninsula has come to an end. Therefore, the focus of the Normandy Peninsula battle has shifted to the Caen area. For several days, British heavy tank formations and German armored units have been engaged in a continuous tug-of-war in the area between Caen and Tilly-sur-Seulles. In the area between Yah [耶] Stream and Fontenay-le-Pesnel, British troops advanced several kilometers under the cover of naval artillery and air force, creating a salient. German troops launched a major counterattack on the 29th. The elite Rommel tank unit is launching a fierce counterattack from the east, south, and north. The British troops feel extremely embarrassed. There is no major change in the situation on the west bank of the Odon River. According to a Reuters dispatch from London: the German counterattack in the Caen area is becoming increasingly acute, and it is reported that Marshal Rommel is personally commanding the armored division. The newly formed American troops in the area between Sanlois and Lecey also show a tendency to launch a major offensive. The situation on the Normandy front is very different from before, and there is a possibility of invading the interior of Northern France from the Cotentin Peninsula.</p>
<p>French Front Line, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Hai Tong News Agency News: The American attempt to encircle Caen has failed. In the past three days, approximately 100 tanks have been lost southwest of Caen.

<p>Berlin, Second Day, Central News Agency Telegram. Hai Tong News Agency News: The German troops in the Hague [海牙, likely a typo for 赫赫, Hague] corner area launched one of their last attacks on the night of the 30th, and the German resistance in the northern part of the Cotentin Peninsula came to an end. The German artillery unit controlling the entrance to the Cherbourg harbor stopped firing on the evening of the 30th due to a lack of ammunition. According to the last radio message from the war zone, yesterday morning, German artillery and [　, likely a typo] grenade launchers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with American troops using bayonets. The American troops used a large number of tanks, fire-shooting weapons, and infantry against the German defenders in the small area of Jobourg for a final attack. According to well-informed German sources, the German troops who have been resisting the American troops with fewer forces in the past few days number no more than 2,000. The anti-Axis forces north of Hague [海牙, likely a typo for 赫赫, Hague] Cape are now using a larger naval unit to prepare to enter the ruined port of Cherbourg.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Complete Destruction of Harbor Facilities <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German frontline military reporter reported on the destruction of the Cherbourg harbor facilities as follows: The iron and concrete pillars of the wharf station were completely destroyed using 800 kg of explosives for each. To destroy the French docks, a ditch 2.5 meters wide and 15 meters deep was dug along the entire bridge. In addition, two freight cars fully loaded with landmines were pulled to the front of the station and detonated, causing all the stone materials to collapse into the turning basin. Furthermore, a 10,000-ton freighter was scuttled at the entrance of the turning basin to block it. For the breakwater, in addition to installing landmines at its base, it was also bombed from below with landmines. The gate of the large dock for accommodating ships has been shattered. Cranes, warehouses, etc., have also been blown to pieces. The Cherbourg harbor facilities have been completely destroyed by such blasting and sinking methods. It will take the enemy a considerable amount of time to restore them in the future. Especially since the difference between high and low tides in the Cherbourg harbor is usually ten meters, it will be even more difficult for them to transport weapons, land, or conduct reorganization and aftercare.</p>

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – DNB reported: In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces are attacking Minsk on four routes. German forces are defending each point to hinder the enemy's advance. Tank units and mechanized infantry are constantly counterattacking the enemy's vanguard, threatening the enemy's flanks and slowing down their advance. The leading Soviet troops are currently engaged in street fighting with German forces in Slutsk. Another unit of Soviet troops crossed the north side of Bobruisk and reached the Viazichy-Osipovichi area. Their tank vanguard has stopped at the Truda River. In the Berezina area, Soviet forces are pressing towards Borisov from Orsha. The two sides are fiercely contending for the city and the river crossing points north of it. There is intense fighting in the upper reaches of the Berezina River and the Drut River, south and west of Polotsk, and in the lake district of the Lepiel area. Attempts by Soviet troops to break into Polotsk have failed. Although the fighting there is still intense, the enemy's offensive seems to have been stopped. Only near Slutsk have Soviet troops reached the west of the Truda River. Responsible parties said that the German forces have taken all measures. On one front, Soviet troops have launched a large-scale attack on the Finnish front. Only in the Tari area have Soviet troops advanced. The Soviet pressure between Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga has increased. Soviet infantry attacked the Finnish army in the Vitele area the day before yesterday, and the Finnish army has withdrawn from Elisenvaara.</p>

<p>There were no significant changes in commodity prices last week. The market prices of a few essential items were relatively high due to smooth sales and sluggish supply. However, there was little demand for non-essential items, and the business transactions in the retail shops were very light. According to people in the industry, these items were previously handled by vendors from various provinces, but in recent years, due to the difficulty of transportation by land and water, even small-scale vendors are hesitant to proceed and have shifted their focus to the sale of essential commodities such as food, fuel, cooking oil, and daily necessities. The economic authorities are still actively conducting investigations, and anyone who violates economic regulations will be punished in accordance with the rules, either with fines or suspension of business.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Commentary: The Tragic Ferry Accident at Gao Miao Wharf <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The tragic ferry accident at Gao Miao Wharf in the Huangpu River, Pudong, on the morning of June 26th, in which passengers were drowned, has been reported in this newspaper. The sinking of a small boat in the Huangpu River, with more than a dozen casualties, may seem like a trivial matter, but it is worth discussing for three reasons:</p>
<p>The boat was a small, privately-owned craft used exclusively to ferry workers of the Yufeng Textile Mill at the wharf, but it did not have a permit from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for operating in the Huangpu River, nor did it join the Ferry Industry Association. It was clearly an illegal ferry. It is obvious that it was not an isolated incident for someone to ferry passengers on the Huangpu River without a permit from the government and to make a business of ferrying workers across the river. Why hadn't the competent authorities discovered it, or if they had, why had they tacitly permitted it under certain conditions? One of these must be the case. It can be seen that the boat owner dared to conceal his actions and act recklessly, leading to overloading without anyone questioning it. The responsible authorities cannot shirk their responsibility.</p>
<p>Passengers rushed to board the boat, crowding the deck before the ferry had come to a complete stop. Fearing an accident, the boat owner hastily steered the boat away from the dock, but the passengers had not yet settled down, and the boat was overloaded, causing it to lose balance and capsize. One can imagine the chaotic scene at the time. The passengers' failure to maintain order and their ignorance of the benefits of mutual assistance made it difficult for them to absolve themselves of the responsibility for the disaster.</p>
<p>With the above two internal defects and the high tide and rapid current, the tragedy was unavoidable. Recalling the accident involving the Huatai Wheel at Xingang on December 9th of last year, the severity of the matters may have been slightly different, but the main causes of the tragedy were the same. It must be understood that safety is paramount in the transportation industry, especially in passenger transport, and the guarantee of safety is the joint responsibility of the competent authorities, the personnel in charge, and the passengers. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the past cannot be undone. It is hoped that after repeatedly undergoing profound lessons, everyone will be vigilant to prevent future problems.</p>
<p>Whether the matter is significant or trivial, the principle is the same. In a country where government officials neglect their duties and in a society where the masses are chaotic and compete for resources, few can escape annihilation in the face of external disasters. The tragic ferry accident at Gao Miao Wharf is another example of a microcosm following the Huatai Wheel accident. Do not ignore it because it is trivial!</p>
<p>The United Overseas Bank Cup Small Soccer League Opened Yesterday, Dragon Victory vs. French Army</p>
<p>The United Overseas Bank (UOB) Cup small-sided football league, sponsored by the United Overseas Bank, opened yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Shanghai Youth Association playground on Xingguo Road, with over three thousand spectators. The first match of the banking group league featured Yongan against Da'an, with Yongan defeating Da'an 3-1. The second match was an exhibition match between Huatong and Wenying, with Huatong defeating Wenying by one goal.</p>
<p>The feature match was between Dragon Victory and the French Army. Dragon Victory's strength increased sharply with the assistance of Yan Shixin, a new Hong Kong officer stationed in Shanghai. As soon as the match began, Dragon Victory's Gao Baozheng commanded his troops to penetrate deep into enemy territory. Qu Yongfu was about to draw his sword, but the French army's Tuopeili tried to save the situation, but inadvertently made things worse, resulting in a terrible situation where the weapon was turned against itself. Dragon Victory got a precious unexpected goal and the generals looked to be taking drugs. Gao Baozheng took the opportunity to score another goal. The French Army refused to be outdone and Dai Lv scored one goal. Dragon Victory led 2-1 at halftime. In the second half, Dragon Victory's Qu Yongfu scored again with the assistance of Zhu Lingsheng. Dragon Victory finally defeated the French Army 3-1.</p>
<p>Dragon Victory Team: Zheng Tongyu, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Zhu Zongsheng, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng, Ruan Longsheng.</p>
