<h3 id="c1">社評　促成滬市七縣模範區 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海特別市管轄區域，包括市區，郊區及縣區三部分。市區範圍包括第一區及南市等地。郊區範圍包括江滬，滬北，滬西，淸東等地。縣區範園包括寶山，申江，南滙，川沙，奉賢，嘉定，崇明等七縣。就上述區域而言，本市管轄範圍相當龐大。我們期待本市成爲全國政治模範區，不僅指市區而言，應包括郊區縣區整個市區範圍。所以，我們對於刷新上海市政的目光，除市區以外，同時應注意於郊區及縣區。</p>
<p>本市所轄的七縣，就地方艦濟而言，均爲庶富之區，各縣糧食都可自給自足，民風淳厚，動儉安分，對於政治模範區的客觀條件已經具備，如能配合完善的行政制度，健金的專家人事，那末，成爲模範縣是不成問題的。况且，市政機關將於八月一日實行合併，謂整人事，則市區行政亦已向模範區的目標以進，將來全市政治成爲全國模範區，也是不成問題的，而問題只在於當局有否決心而己。</p>
<p>怎樣是當局的決心呢？第一，確立各縣區的行政制度。第二，健全各縣區的行政人事。第三，整理各縣的財政收支。第四，維護各縣區的治安問題，茲加申論如次：</p>
<p>第一，各縣行政制度，應即依據歷來採用各種制度之利弊得失，參照當地的特殊環境，確立完善制度。</p>
<p>第二，健全各縣行政人事，尤爲必要。如果行政制度雖己改善·而人事並未健全，則換湯不換藥，效果仍等於零。健全縣行政人事，首先是縣長之選用。我們曾在六月二十四日的社評中，詳論縣長人選之重要。我們說：「目前和平區內各縣縣長之委任，能取人才主義者，並不多見。大半遷就當地具有潛勢力者充任縣長，或不學無術之輩，夤緣鑽營。或粗曉日語之通譯人員，藉與盟邦各地當局接觸之便利，慫恿推薦，若輩旣無政治學識與行政經騐、而其目的又不正當，一旦走馬上任，更是狐假虎威，氣燄萬丈，遂致地方政治不上軌道，民生疾苦愈益加深。」所以，本市所屬七縣的縣長人選，應特別慎重銓衡，以有行政經騐，有遠大抱負，有苦幹精神，有廉正操守者為標準。近聞現任各縣區縣長，一月之中大部時間逗留市區內，不論其爲接洽公務，或爲貪圖舒服，均非所宜。其次，縣佐治人員以及保甲人員，亦須嚴格甄用，悉符人才主義。</p>
<p>第三，各縣財政收支，加以整理，首先廢除苛雜，以疏民困。正當之田賦等稅收，不妨量出爲入，酌予提高。原則上取之於地方者，用之於地方。</p>
<p>第四，治安確立，實為行政有效之絕對保障，如果治安不能確立，則一切行政設施徒增紛擾，並無成效。所謂治安，就地軍警以保民爲職志，不但本身絕對不能擾民，更須排除足以擾民的任何惡勢力。淸鄕的實施，應爲一時的緊急措施，不能視爲經常工作，以免發生許多流弊。</p>
<p>上述四則，有相互依存之關係，配合並行，不可偏廢。上海市內的七縣，都成為模範縣後，才能改變上海近郊的惡劣環境，才能保衛整個上海的治安。我們在市政機關實施合併。市政設施積極刷新之前，對於縣區行政的改善，尤致無限的期待。</p>

<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十七日中央社電二十六日下午，以航空艦若干艘爲主幹之敵機動部隊，於帛琉羣島附近海面出現，其艦上所載之艦上機二十餘架，曾來襲帛琉羣島，日地上部隊當即與之應戰，擊落其二架，日方損害極輕微。又當日雅普島方面亦有敵機來襲。</p>

<p>南京二十七日中央社電　德元首希特勒，於昨（二十七日）覆電汪主席，對慰問表示感謝，原電如次：「中華民國國民政府主席汪精衛閣下，本人遭遇謀刺，幸得無恙，遙承電賜慰問，感綛無既。茲向閣下敬表謝忱，希特勒。」</p>
<h3 id="c7">國府積極推進　鄉村建設 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　今年是增產年，爲着安定民生，爲着臻固國本，爲着協力大東亞戰爭，積極的增產，眞是刻不容緩，耍迎頭趕上，確確寶實的推進增產工作，尤其在這糧價劇漲，米貴於珠的時候，增產工作中最主要而贊首先努力的，自然還是「民以食爲天」的糧食增產。這裏試先檢討今日的所謂糧食恐慌的原因，主要的還是因爲農村不安，所以農業衰敗。在這情形下，要談農業增產，則鄕村建設之全面的積極的推進，實在是應該最先着手的當務之急。所以此次最高國防會議中通過的「鄕村建設計劃大綱」，實在是洞燭應結的賢明施策。由此可知國府當局不僅已具有了「建設鄕村，加强增產」的決心，而且又訂定了計劃大綱，作具體的指示，並決定組織「鄕村建設實施委員會」，以主持推進鄕利建設的全般事宜。這裏我們可以斷言的，就是鄕村建設的成功，一定可以達到增產的目的，從而民生亦可賴以安定，在本固邦寗之下，對於大東亞戰爭之協力，自然將更爲强報而有力。本來在這個全世界都在戰火中的時候，要談建設，尤其是中國的鄕村建設，自然不是件容易的　，但是也惟其如此，更須要突破萬難，從艱難困苦中完成建設，才是最有效果，最有意義。舉個例說，異邦日本，在這大東亞戰爭之下，所以能愈戰愈强，就是因為能够做到積極的增產，已把原來的食糧不足，做到了自給自足。這個原因，一方面固然是因為戰時下日本農民的熱誠努力，同時何嘗不是因為日本的農村建設，已有了完善的規模的緣故呢。從這裏，我們可以反觀一下我們的農業增產，為何不能卓著成效，爲何還嚷着糧價劇漲，糧食恐慌呢？這原因，還是因爲我國的鄕村在此戰亂之下，實在不能得到安定，因此也更談不到什麼建設。是故，這次我們對於「鄕村建設實施委員會」，根據「鄕村建設計劃大綱一來推進鄕村建設事宜，實抱有無限的期望。相信不但可以達到今年之「增產年」的目標，而且將由此奠定中國之鄕村建設的基礎。</p>

<h3 id="c23">大上海行政機構　實現一元化　八月一日一區公署併入市府 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>去年八月一日，承盟邦日本之盛意，協助我國接收上海公共租界，法租界亦於同時交還我國，當時設立一八兩區公署，分別接收前兩租界之行政權。迨本年二月一日，前第八區公署，奉令撤銷。該區各項行政，務歸第一區公署掌理，於是前兩租界之畛域，完全消滅，對於市府之統一，裨益良多。今年八月一日適逢交還租界一週年之期，市政當局鑒於上海市政機構之重複，實有早日促成市政統一之必要，經與中央曁有關方面一再商討後，決定於八月一日將市政府遷設江西路第一區公署內。上海特別市之最高行政機關，一旦設置於市區中心，自可引起市民之注目，而同時租界之形態，亦將消失於無形。記者爲明瞭此事眞相起見，特走訪市府吳秘書長，承將業已確定之各項計劃，詳爲見吿，茲撮述其要點如左：</p>
<p>管轄區域</p>
<p>一，上海特別市管轄區域之劃分：　市區，一舊一區（包轄前八區，滬西，閘北，江灣這併入地區），二，舊七區（即南市區第七區肥署撤消），三，滬西一部份併入區，四，浦束一部份併入區（沿黃浦江地區）。　郊區，一，江灣區（即前市中心區及吳淞一部份），二，滬北區，三，滬西區，四，浦東北區，五，浦東南區，以上五區仍設區公署管轄之。　縣區，一，賓山縣，二，申江縣（即前北橋特別區），三，南匯縣，四，川沙縣，五，奉賢縣，六，嘉定縣，七，崇明縣，以上七縣，即前特別區改設縣治後，暫歸市政府管轄，並由中央簡派行政督察專員兩人，分區督察上列七縣。</p>
<p>上海特別市市區圖</p>
<p>機關組織</p>
<p>二，上海特別市政府所屬各機關，市政府在八月一日遷至一區公署內，一區公署於是日撤消，其原有各處，按其性質與市府已設各局處實行合併，改爲下列各局處：　警察局（第一第二兩警察局合併爲警察局），　財政局，　經濟局，　工務局，　衛生局，　公用局，　地政局，　社會福利局，　敎育局，　宣傳處，　　物品配給處。</p>
<p>三，市政府之內部組織，市長下仍設秘書長一人，簡任秘書薦任秘書若干人，並就簡任秘書中，特派一人爲主任秘書，襄助秘書長處理事務，秘書處將就行政事務與技術之方面，分設四組三科三室，分掌職務，此外市府原有經濟顧問辦公室及參事室，亦將一併遷入一區辦公。</p>
<p>辦公地點</p>
<p>四，市政府及各局處之辦肥地點，第一區公署全部房屋，係前工務局所建，內部設備雖甚完善，但欲將各局全部遷入，非事實所許可，故市府所屬各機關，決定分設於一區公署市府原址及前八區等三處，　設在原第一區公署內，計有一，市長室，二，秘書長室，三，秘書處，四，參事室，五，經濟顧問辦公室，六，財政局，七，工務局，八，衛生局。　經濟局，公用局，宣傳處，物資配給處，分設於前第八區公署。　地政局，社會福利局，敎育局，分設於前市府原址，至警察局與保安處地點照舊。</p>
<p>又開市政府移至市區以內後，人員待遇，職務分配，以及內部各科編制，當有適當之調整，務以適合行政節素化爲原則。</p>

<p>稻村：技術公開情形下的獎勵，是對公開者而言呢？抑是對企業體而言呢？</p>
<p>備藤：這一點對於我們各個成員是非常淡泊的，會員們每天都在進行着技術公開的工作。在集體設計的工塲裏，往往說，你幹吧！有一點成績了，你就幹吧！請你作吧！拿着別人的設計圖從事工作，在世界上像這樣的技術公開，眞是很少呢。大家相互都沒有把獎勵金放在心上，而只知道相互間開誠佈公地合作着。</p>
<p>稻村：然而還有時候，在甲公司中出現了非常好的出品，這是多年慘澹經營的研究結果。而乙，丙，丁等公司，無論如何都趕不上這種成績。如在這種情形下，把技術公開出來，則甲公司的特異性，或企業體的優秀性，就有喪失的危險。在這樣非常重要的情形下，或許有人懷疑該工業中的最重要部份能否公開，然而在現實中，我認爲是能够的。</p>
<p>備藤：在產業機械方面，也似乎是最成問題的。我雖不敢說是好是壊，但在工作機械方面，業已從數年節就成立了公會。從那個時候起，對於技術公開大家都非常高興。從業者間，大家都相互無條件地公開着。至於其他方面，就發生好多問題，如不合條件，則大公司就不肯公開出來。我是不明白這種心理狀態的。自然這是生產過程，是某種意義上的生產過程。例如使用人造煤油機械，甚至也把生產過程公開出來，自已當交出這種機械的塲合，固然是會想到要把自己的一切交給他人，但實際說來，這是相互作共同的事情。縱或不是相互作共同的事情，而是作個別不同工作的工塲間，如把技術公開出來，這是眞正爲了國家，如果因公開而附帶以金錢，這反倒弄糟了。目前的公司多半都如此。</p>
<p>稻村：這或許不是少數例外吧！日本全國的工業或許全都如此。</p>
<p>備藤：全國還談不到吧！</p>
<p>花田：我所知道的狹仄範團內，飛機生產方面，是進行得非常好。再就是海軍方面參加的塲合，也進行得很順利。所以我認爲在實際問題上，是可以順利進行的。全國當然也如此。再就是非常美滿地進行。在國家方面，固然應當考慮到，以何種形式表彰，以多少金錢獎賞，但直至如今，業已聰到了許多美談。然而技術公開，也不是胡來的。</p>
<p>此外，去年在技術院會進行過技術指導，而今年仍在繼續進行中，例如大家都知道的潤滑技術研究所業已成立，緞村先生所從事的工作，即工場中所使用的油，僅用過去四分之一或五分之一就够了，這眞是一個新紀元。曾使日本所有的油量增加了三倍或四倍，這眞是奇跡。假如拿報酬來和成果比較，眞付相形見絀之感，然而本入却在歡天喜地工作着。現在業已成爲財團法人研究所，在資材方面，則由技術院來幫忙，不至於有阻撓的地方。</p>
<p>近來業已開始製造木船，這也受海務院的技術領導，同時也有技術的人參加其中而在技術方面幫忙着。因此，近來頗受各方面的稱贊。目前一般城鄉鑄造工塲，凡生產不能向上者，則由東京的池貝鐵工所以及關西的久保田鐵工所，或由八幡籌物研究所的石川先生等，出而作技術上的指導。這樣而獲得到的利益，如加以計算，則報酬方面眞是微乎其微了。然而凡在工作的人，都不計報酬，而高興地工作着。所以任何杞憂是用不着的。</p>
<p>稻村：我再從官廳和官吏方面，或從統制會以及政府方面來檢討一下着。站在實際從業者的立塲上，我認為決不是如此。仍然還存在着技術公開的障碍。例如琉瑙工業方面就有這樣實在的例十，我認爲解決這種不肯分開的情形，並非提高科學家及技術家的國家意識的觀念問題，或心理問題。而先決問題是最具體的經濟組織方面之企業體合併，如是則技術公開問題迎刃而解，所以並非是觀念和心理的問題，而是站在經濟組織立塲上的企業合併問題。</p>
<p>花因：這十點站在國家方面，是必須考慮到的問題。</p>
<p>記者：如把方才稻村先生所說的一個企業整頓問題，加以研究，則問題就大了。</p>
<p>稻村：拿一個德國的實例來說，德國的染料公司是極端相互對立着競爭着，於是就成立了名爲IG的組織，加以全盤的調整。對於這一工作支付最太苦心者，就是杜斯堡這個人，曾使技術發生過空前的發展。這是怎樣產生的呢？這並非是單純德國科學家的自覺。企業合併，而造成技術交流的現象。在這一點上來說，日本現狀我認爲尚未充分。</p>
<p>大橋：談到技術公開，也有五花八門的形式。有關於製造方式者，有關於設備者，有關於設計圖者，有關於經騐及熟練者等等。其中關於設備者，關於設計圖者等等，因爲是公司的財產，所以如想以無代價的公開，却非常的困難。自由主義國家的美國，許多同業者各有其獨自的專賣權，而規定出專賣利潤來，入會會員對於同業者可以享受專賣的特權。此外，入會者對於構成集團的一份子或公共的同盟集團，則支付專賣實施費，後者對於實施費，是按各入會者的生產額而來分攤的。這就是專賣利潤，目的是在於以集團來壟斷市塲。全體主義的德國，由生產同一品種軍需的企業，作成名日公會（Rign）的生產集團，由公會負責人加以指導，實行技術公開工作。專賣特許權費是富向國家要來時，由一至幾百爲百分之幾，由幾百至幾百爲百分之幾，道樣實行遞藏法，結果就是免費，用這樣方法來補償。只要技術家和企業都以服務民族爲第一義，則不許可永久壟斷，自屬當然。我們日本對於人造煤油業，結成人造煤油製造技術公會，以翰旋專費樣的公開工作，造就是最有成績的組織。這就是使官方技術無酬公開的一個辦法。技術公開的一個最　問題，就是報酬問題。過去的研究費用，雖然能够完全明，了但由於技術壟斷而生的利益估計，是非常厲風行的澈底立塲來判斷，我認爲是必要的。然而因此而勾消優秀企業的創意設計，是不可以的，所以對於價格政策是需要特別加以斟酌的。納粹的軍需收買價格，是按上年度平均的實際價格來規定的，生產效率愈大，則利益亦愈大。我並不十分明白，只知道是以專賣權補償費及這種價格政策來巧妙地刺激企業的發明設計。（未完）（季譯自四月號日本評論）</p>

<p>— 陳禾</p>
<p>戰時國民宴會限制之實行，足見當局決意廢除民間奢侈糜費之惡習，其目的爲適應戰時體制，勵行節約。其原則凡爲冥誕遷居訂婚安葬，六十歲以下之壽辰等，不准設宴款客，及不得採用如魚翅燕窩熊掌等奢侈高貴物品。上次當局已不准各高等菜館售飯及限時飲酒等法令頒行，酒菜館營業突然淸淡，此次綱要公布後，更將一落千丈。在戰時節約運動立塲，無可非議，但在菜館無法營菜必將倒閉而言，亦不無商榷之處。</p>
<p>上海酒菜館，經營現代化者，爲數不少；且在飲食衛生上亦具有相當價値，如選料新鮮，烹調入味，布置淸靜，招待週到等等而爲舊式菜館所忽略者，均已顧到。抑有進著，新式菜館之組織，採分工合作制分廚房食堂帳房貨倉等部，所投資本亦鉅。全由酒菜館業領袖以歷年經騐，研究而來，惜領導尙未盡得法，以致造成目前奢侈麋費之風習、希望該業領導者目光移轉，迎合政府政策，符合戰時體制與節約會等合作，遏制奢侈糜費之風氣，而謀繼續在飲食上作更有價值之發明。</p>
<p>國民宴會限制綱要中所禁用之物資，現存於各菜館之貨倉者，將如何利用抑聰其自然損壊淘汰，爲値得老慮之問題。爲適合現行體制及實行節約物資起見，當不能聽其自然損壊，應有妥善辦法處置，如鮑魚燕窩魚翅能掌等，如果各菜館願意售出則向有關當局登記，由請核定價格公賣，或分發各菜館採用，以免物資朽腐，而受血本之虧損，經公正機關核定之價格，當亦校其他魚肉之價格相仿，並不奢貴，此與國民宴會限制規程上節約物資之原則並無損害。</p>
<p>奢侈糜費已成風習，且其潛勢力暗伏四方，撲滅非易，不但高等酒菜館有此風習，譬如各大酒菜館如因節宴運動而營業不振，甚或閉門，則代之起者如咖啡館，所投資本超過酒菜館，而奢侈糜費之程度有過之無不及，以飲食上之價値言，盡人皆知虛耗而已，與戰時體制相差過遠，不見當局阻止，聽任發展，可知奢侈糜費之潛勢力仍極蒂固，僅以法令加之酒菜館，縱使透氣不轉而倒閉，對於整例節約運動，實未見收效，而於賣踐戰時生活，依然未能實現</p>

<h3 id="c39">馬利亞納海面　日美艦隊决戰記 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>六月中旬，以馬利亞納羣島爲中心，日美兩國的艦隊展開了空前的海上火決戰。日本艦隊航空部隊於六月十九日晨發動先制攻擊，一起首便樹下擊毀美國航空母艦數艘的大功。嗣後，由於日方的薄暮攻擊；夜襲和潛艇的活動，戰果逐漸擴大，但戰局亦因此次海戰而益形嚴重，所以必須從各力面徹底增强戰力。</p>
<p>六月〇〇日，日本聯合艦隊的一部分認爲擊滅敵艦隊的時機已到，完成了出擊的態勢。敵方的兵力，據說擁有戰艦十餘艘，標準航空母艦十艘左右，特護航空母艦十餘艘，此外尙有巡洋艦驅逐艦潛水艇等，合計不下百餘艘。足見他們已抽調太平洋海軍勢力的大部分，馮恃自有海戰史以來所未見的龐大數量，進犯日軍防綫。從六月十一日到十八日，驅使他們誇稱總數一千架以上的艦載機，轟炸爲利亞納羣島各地的日本航空基地，然後復將水上艦艇駛近各島，實行艦砲射擊，終於十五日在塞班島登陸。對於這種旁若無人的騐慢態度，日眾隱忍自重，不動聲色，於基地部隊盡全力從事防禦之間，聯合艦隊的一部分集結於〇〇，悄悄完成了作戰配置的展開</p>
<p>〇〇日午後，日軍出動部隊的可令長官頒發訓示，略謂：「我部隊行將踏上擊滅敵艦之壯途，各員務須全力以赴。」全艦隊的乘員，上自艦長下至小兵，皆踴躍堆各就戰鬥配置，暫於這一戰中奏凱面回</p>
<p>十八日黎明時起，各人皆全副武裝，盼望與數相會，然因時機尙未成熟，雖已探明敵狀，仍引滿不放，一路向美艦隊游弋的海面驀進</p>
<p>先制攻擊</p>
<p>十九日是決戰之日。天尙未明之際，索敵機就已出發。天際，星光閃爍。未幾，東方泛白，光輝的晨曦照耀着南海的波浪。今日才是太平洋有始以來的大艦隊與大艦隊的會戰之日。不久，索敵機發見敵方機動部隊，開始接觸</p>
<p>據報敵艦行駛於馬利亞納羣島西方海上，共有三羣，第一羣由標準航空母艦四艘·戰艦二艘·其他十餘艘構成，第二羣由標準般空母艦三艘·戰艦五艘·其他艦艇十餘艘構成，第三羣則有標準航空母艦一艘·特設航空母艦二艘及其他艦艇約十艘。同時，關於其他敵機勁部隊的狀况，亦陸續有報吿的電報拍來。</p>
<p>時機到了！日軍的艦最機羣相繼出發。堂堂的大編隊在艦隊上空聯翩飛翔，翼上的日章映着晨曦，分外美麗。艦艇上面的人員，揮臂搖帽，高聲歡呼，預祝他們火捷歸來。第一批艦載機羣出發以後，狂風暴雨突作，海上頓時失去平靜。</p>
<p>「遲一點便不能出發了！」艦艇上的人員不禁感謝天公的祝佑。</p>
<p>其後，第二編隊第三編隊………相繼出發。在這當兒，艦隊實行嚴密的警戒航行，一路蹴浪前進。</p>
<p>護衛敵機動部隊的戰鬥機極多，佈下了三四朮的防禦網，單是突破這種嚴密的防備，即需超人的力量。</p>
<p>「總得突破防禦網才好！」</p>
<p>「炸中航空母艦時，那才好哩！」</p>
<p>大家一邊默祝成功，一邊焦急地等待着攻擊機隊的捷音。〇時〇〇分，收信機收到攻擊機隊指揮官發給部下的電報：「全機決死攻擊！」同時並收到報吿的電訊：「現在敵上空空戰中。」</p>
<p>「啊哈，幹起來啦！」</p>
<p>剛咽下一口涎唾潤了潤乾的咽喉，又接到「命中敵標準航空母艦一艘」的報吿；是被〇〇公斤的炸彈命中的。接着，捷音相繼傳來，判明擊毀敵航空母艦三艘以上。第一次的先制攻擊是成功了！</p>
<p>揚聲器將捷音傳播到艦內的各隅，士氣愈盛。</p>
<p>從〇〇點管起，攻擊機隊順次歸來，與完成了素敵重任的偵察機隊一同收容起來。可是有向架攻擊機，因氣象狀况不良及在激戰中受到敵彈的緣故，雖然勉强飛到母艦前面，仍不能平安無事地降陸。</p>
<p>對空戰鬥</p>
<p>二十日拂曉，索敵機出發搜索敵機，水上艦艇亦猛然突進。午後，於相距〇〇公里的洋上捉住由航空母艦二艘，戰艦二艘及其他十餘艘而成的敵機動部隊，攻擊機隊當即實行薄暮攻擊。這時，觸接機拍來一個報吿，聲稱敵方亦已放出艦載機來襲了。全艦隊馬上完成對空戰鬥的配置。記者亦塞上耳挃，背負防毒面具，載起鋼盔，站在艦橋上，屏息凝神，等待敵機光臨。</p>
<p>是時，太陽已向西傾，〇〇時〇〇分，守望員登見怎問的敵機，當即報吿道：</p>
<p>「左眩〇〇度，高度〇千，距離〇萬，敵機編隊正向上飛來。」</p>
<p>「達底，達底…」戰鬥的號聲高響入雲。白色頭布上加　鋼盔的高角砲員，準備舒齊，祗待命令一下，即可開火。出沒於低重的暗雲間的敵機接近我艦隊上空時，我方艦艘一邊繼續施行戰鬥航行向敵艦衝去，一邊朝天拉開砲門。海上突然充滿了震耳欲聾的砲聲。半空中，高角砲强有敵機羣中紛紛炸裂。這時，從三千餘公尺的高空向我航空母艦〇〇號急降下來的敵方第一機及第二機，忽然曳着黑烟，垂直落下，在我航空母艦後方遠處的海面激起了一陣浪花。</p>
<p>在我方漫天的猛烈砲火中狼狽不堪的敵機，隊伍大亂，胡亂將炸彈投在海裏，匆匆遁走。可是，這羣敵機退到雖快，却已在一瞬間被擊隊半數以上。在敵機退盡的天空，於斷雲問，祗留下無數輕淡的炸烟。</p>
<p>未幾，又有一羣敵機來襲，但隊形不擊，戰意全無。向軍艦〇〇號突進的數架雷擊機，一遇到猛烈的防禦砲火，也不投魚雷，轉身就逃。另一方面，我方的防衛戰鬥機亦以寡敵眾，巧妙反攻，將尙未飛出友方視界的敵機捉住，一架，又一架地打下來。某架戰鬥機以一敵三，發揮無敵的戰鬥技術，瞬息擊隊了其中一架。</p>
<p>凱旋歸來</p>
<p>這樣，敵方的攻擊，結果是偷鷄不着　把米，非但不曾獲得什麼戰果，反面折損了好些。這次的對空戰鬥，和記者去年在〇〇經騐到的敵方艦載機的空襲比較起來，不論是對艦艇的攻擊技術或其鬥志，都已大大低下了。</p>
<p>擊退敵機以後，我們的艦隊照常航行，以常常的陣容前進，採取突擊的勢態，希望不久有一次夜戰。他方面，　暮攻擊的戰果是弄明自了，我方已炸沈了敵軍標準大型航空每艦班加希爾，但敵軍也乘隙集中攻擊我方的油槽船，使其中二艘起火焚燒</p>
<p>如是，這次空前的大艦隊與大艦隊的會戰、結果成為一面倒的局勢，我方祗損失航空母艦一艘，其餘全部無恙，不過最後不得不鳴金收兵。因此，殘存的敵軍機動部隊仍在馬利亞納近海游弋。這種情形很足表明目前戰局的嚴重性。從各方面增强戰力，實爲當前急務。（高師報通班員發自軍艦〇〇號上）（譯自七月四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c40">西歐戰爭的白熱化 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>德國宣傳部長郭培爾，七月八日在某集會中大聲疾呼道：「德國國民現正處於危機之中！」要求每個國民都比以前更嚴格地參加總力戰。</p>
<p>「德人的戰時生活中尚有餘力。例如在空襲中房屋燒燬，財產失盡，骨肉傷亡的所謂空襲被害者的生活，和那些住於得免敵機恐怖轟炸之地的人們的生活間，尙有很大的距離。因此，德國人應以空襲被害地人們的困苦生活作爲生活的標準，不作精神上或物質上的要求。」郭培爾博士說。</p>
<p>在這認爲德國可驚的總力戰體制尙未充分的呼續中，可以窺見德國今日重大深刻的立塲。南方義大利戰綫的敵軍攻勢，西方諾曼地半島的敵軍登陸，以及東方蘇軍萬人的推進，都顯然表明反德聯軍已經開始了總攻擊。</p>
<p>到柏林的捷徑</p>
<p>而且，觀察這些攻擊的樣十，都可察出敵軍有選擇到柏林的最短距離以期一舉推翻德國的決心。德國對於敵方的此種意圖，也早已洞知底蘊。因此，不待郭培爾博士的說明，德國國民早就徹底覺悟今夏是決戰的最後關頭。至今年桂十飄香時，歐洲戰爭將可越過高潮了吧。據目前的形勢，假定戰爭在今年結束，歐洲戰爭的歸趨如何，須由最近三個月或四個月的戰局發展來決定。「時間是德國的朋友。」這個主張雖曾長久支配着德國的思想，但今日已沒有一人將這句話掛在口頭上了。敵軍旣已要求最後的決戰，德國自當竭盡今日所有的全部力量起而反攻。</p>
<p>競走將臨終點</p>
<p>對於現在的白熱化戰局，德國指導者們的看法如何呢？他們怎樣向國民解釋呢？郭培爾博士於九日德報星期評論末尾所用的辭句，意義很深刻。他將這次戰爭比爲長距離競走，面且終點的白綫也已近在眼前。競走已到最後一圈的直綫跑道了。郭培爾博十說：</p>
<p>「不諭怎樣工，我們已不能改變這條路，所以祗有咬緊牙齒，盡力跑到最後一秒鐘。誰能忍受，勝利便屬於誰。不管是敵人或友方，那一方面能够支撑得更久，就可決定勝負。在我們的脚踵後面，兇暴的敵人正以必死之勢趕來。觀之，即使相差咫尺，第一個切斷終綫的就勝了。」</p>
<p>由這種表現的方法看來，也可明白戰局現已到了如何緊張的階段。這並不是修辭上的比喩，而是切實的感覺。即以德國的想法來看，現在戰爭亦已打成平手。德國是想在最後一圈以一胸之望而奪得錦標。希特勒元首在去年一月三十日的演說中，曾有這樣一句話：「此戰結束時，我們非死即勝。」現在，生死的交界正知隔了一層紙。目前如果氣力不雞雞，那便不免死亡！</p>
<p>又，另一方面，德國正高呼「唯此一戰」，作萬全的努力。一個德國從軍記者描寫西方諾曼第戰綫的情形說：「敵我雙方目前的戰鬥狀態，打一個譬喩，正如兩個互相扭住揪牢的角力者，大家都鬧得油汗直流，可是都咬緊牙齒，誰也不動一動。精力漸漸消耗，有時雙方吸了一口氣，調整一下急促的呼吸。突然，對方的手足像閃電一般活動起來。敵方當不住了，想掙脫扭住他的德國的鋼腕。但是，德國移動了一下脚步，戰鬥又恢復到揪住不動的姿勢。</p>
<p>奪回西歐主動</p>
<p>然而，這種互扭互揪的角力，決不會中途拆散的。不是摔倒了對后，便也自己倒下去，總之，必定會有一勝一敗的。為什麼呢？因為雙方尚未動用主力。郭培爾博士也說：「決定性的戰鬥將在最近開始。」反德聯軍目前是在距離柏林約千公里的圓周上，正於法北，義境及東部各戰綫設法將對德包團圈更向內縮。德國在過去二年間雖說採取後退作戰，但猶在遠離開戰常初的國境綫之地作戰。戰爭的局勢目下雖似有利於握有攻學主動權的反德聯軍一，但德國是內綫防禦者，於三正面中，犧牲東部及義大利戰綫，以期在西方奪回攻擊的主動權。（譯自七月十二日朝日新開）</p>

<p>是一個風淸月白的晚上，躺在斗室內一張破舊的床上，一個年近四十的中年婦人，面容相當淸秀，伸有估瘦的手在撫摩着她唯一的愛女，用懇切的語調在叮囑着「惠，妳已不是一個小孩子，一切都應懂得，自妳爸死後。我與妳外祖母含辛茹苦的扶義妳，指望將來妳能服務社會，我們也好有個依靠，目今我的計劃已不能如願，妳的學業也只能半送面廢，雖然妳有志念書，可是也不可能的了，這幾天我的精神更萎頒，料想離世的日子也不遠了，……」一陣陣苦澀凄長的聲音，使惠再也忍不住了：「媽，妳別再說下去，我相信妳的病一定會好的。」「再有……妳……年老的……外祖……母……妳要……孝順……她……我死後……千萬……勸妙……不要過份悲傷……」她灰白色臉上的淚兒與惠的淚珠交併成一片，再也分辨不出是誰的了。</p>
<p>在一個風雨交加的夜晚，惠的媽終於棄下了孤兒老母離開了人問。光陰似流水般地過去，惠自媽去世後經濟窘迫一日甚一日，生活的鞭子在驅策着惠，眼看那慈祥白髪的外祖母，天天以米湯度日，惠怎樣忍心呢？於是不得不開始奮鬥，掙扎，可是在這世態炎凉。人心險亞的社會，再也不允許一個弱女子生存下去，她處處受到人家的譏笑，藐視，尤其是一般勢利的新威們，她得不到憐憫，同情與幫助，她痛哭，可是哭出血來，也不見一個人去慰問，她痛恨這世界無情，但這有什麼用呢。</p>
<p>終於在一具春天，爲了生活，爲了經濟的壓迫，呼救無門，於是她屈服在一個毫無知識卑鄙下流的商人家中爲妾了，她雖是百般的不願，但回顧着年老多病的外祖母時，她又含淚忍受了。精神的磨柳使她非常痛苦，在無聊之際，唯有書本才是她的安慰者，此時惠的那顆心靈早已冰冷得如死去一般，她別的希望沒有，唯一的便是能眼看外祖母，平安地得了此徐年，然後再毀滅自己的生命。她期待着，一年是過去了！期待也來臨了……，外祖母眼看着心愛的外孫女兒斷送在一個粗鄙市儈的手裏，她怎樣忍心呢，所以憂　積成疾病，也走上了惠的母親的路途。此時的惠已不再想生存下去了，當外祖母的靈柩將蓋上時，她也想一躍而入，同外祖母一塊去，但這是不可能的，左右人早將她一把拉住，惠是更傷心了，要死難道也這樣難嗎？</p>
<p>已五更天了，殯儀館內寂靜得更悽慘，野外的草彼風吹着瑟瑟作聲，惠以嘶啞的聲調在哭泣着，淚兒乾了，只聽見別人的睡眠聲，與幾個老婆婆悽凉的唸經聲，惠已有六晚朱睡，但倒下也不想睡，越想越悲，難道我的命竟如此苦嗎，她這樣想着。一會兒天巳微明了，她拖着疲乏的身子踱着鄭重的脚步，在庭中徘徊着，在她身後忽然好似有一個人站着，惠覺得恐怖起來了，莫非是鬼罷，她鼓起勇氣往後一看，惠的臉紅了，原來是一個少年，那麼英俊，彼此點一下頭，在這冷靜的空氣中，他開口了：「小姐，尊姓？」「鄙姓張。」惠回答了一聲，心是那麼紊亂，再也沒有勇氣問他了，「喔張小姐，，死去的是令堂罷；這樣的傷心，但人死不能復生，自己身體要緊。那位穿西裝的老先生火槪是令尊罷。像我罷早年死去了父親，也不是同你一般的傷心吧，但我們還年靑，應在自己的本位上努力，使九泉下的光人才能得到安慧。」他滔滔不絕以懇切態度在安慰着惠，在這種局面下使惠是窘極了，她想讓她的苦衷使別人能知道一點，也好實洩一下她心中的情戀，於是她竣起十二分的勇氣直言相告了，心中憂急着了，他一定會以輕視的眼光來看我吧？豈知相反的，他的語調是那麼地溫柔，「不，這不是你的罪惡，你還年輕，你需要自由，需要幸福。」惠科直要發狂了，幾年來從未聽見過人家同情她的一句，今天，地如一個內犯得到的輕於似的快樂，幾年來從未有過的笑臉，她今天是展開在一個陌生少年的面前了。</p>
<p>少女的靑春是易於復活的，惠一顆久已冰冷了的心田，開始活躍了，她自從那一天認識了邨，被此的心苗巾早已藏着了感情，她知道邨是一個誠實的靑年，年齡才不過二十五哉，比惠大上四歲，正在一家銀行內服務，家中除了母親外還有一個姊姊孀居在家，自此邨常邀她往田野問或山脚下散步，各地僻靜處都有過他們的足跡，惠是陶醉了，她不知世上還有仇恨，類惱和悲哀，每天只　於愛河中，和邨二人誰也離不了誰，他們在計劃着怎樣脫離這環境，然後又怎樣預備結婚，婚後的生活又如何的美麗歡業，一切的一切都被他們想過了。</p>
<p>晴天的碧空驟然起了事多磨，事嚴的不密，惠和邨相戀的事，竟被那商人知道了，於是惠就失去自由被軟禁着，不能自由進出。她簡直如一頭金絲鳥，錦衣玉食，要待主人歡心時才帶着她到各處逛逛……。</p>
<p>初戀的滋味是够甜的了，惠雖然是身體被束縛着，可是她的一顆心早已飛向邨的懷抱裏去了，她天天在想望着邨，希望能有一個機會，再能重聚往日的歡樂。</p>
<p>煩惱的春天又來了，惠是最厭惡春天的，它能使人憶想起已往的情景，她覺得自己做了三年的工具，被他盡量的洩慾，始終沒有得到一點眞純愛的，她太苦痛了，於是想起了邨，他們純潔坦白的相愛了短短的一個時期又坐生地拆開了，這又怎能不痛心呢？當她深夜想念邨時眼淚會浸沒了整個枕布，她當為着邨祝福祈禱，希望他身體健康平安無事，她愛他的心是永遠不變的，過去愛他現在也愛他，將來還是愛他，直到死也忘不了他。</p>
<p>經過許多波折磨難的惠，她已猜透了人生是怎麼一會事，那簡直像一塲春夢，她也瞭解了人生的真締，必須苦苦地幹一下，才不負此一生光陰。於是在飽經患難，艱苦備嘗之後，她開始澈悟了：世上最寶貴的只有自由！的福是靠自己去負責爭取幸！她便痛下決心，割棄一切物質的享受，不願永過依賴寄生的生活！尤其是這沒有愛，沒有真情，只有無限屈辱的生活。終於，迎着第四個炎夏的降臨，惠，毅然地脫離，這籠罩着金錢魔力的家！埋葬了一切的回憶，遠離了上海，和邨一同奔赴光明的前程，建設他們憧憬中的美滿合理想的家庭去了！</p>
<h3 id="c42">薔薇之話 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 燿靑</p>
<p>我愛薔薇，並不是她可以爲愛情的象微，是爲了她除有嬌艷的花而外，還有刺，所以我便常讀魯迅底「無花的薔薇」。</p>
<p>蓄薇，學名呌Kosaaciclaris。在中國，却有好多的別稱。像「本草經」寫作墻靡，李時珍說：「草夢柔靡，依墻援面生，故名。」一名刺紅，一名山棘。本草經說：「其莖多刺，勒人，牛喜食之，故有諸名。又一名買笑，事見「賈氏說林」，因漢武帝與陛華同賞薔薇花時，以黃金百斤爲買笑錢的一件事。</p>
<p>兒時，讀周敦頤的「愛連說」，一個時期克想故起隱士來，同時受了「愛玉說」的宣傳，對於運花感情也便不錯，牡丹則嫌她太俗，壓根兒便不愛她，至於薔薇，却是後來的事。入世一深，事物的理解力增强了，對於那些婀娜無力，嬌滴滴的全部沒有點兒骨氣，宰割由人，有如羔羊般馴服，祗令人　愛者，我厭棄了；推而廣之，草木蟲魚，同其這典型的，也都從我的愛好中被驅逐了出去。所以我愛蜜蜂而不愛蝴蝶，與愛薔薇的有刺，是同根據這個見解的。</p>
<p>薔薇，在這個世界上，愛她的人自然是不少的，然而所愛的多在她那嬌艷的各種各色的花，愛她的刺的，却怕不多吧。</p>
<p>唐朝的裴度，他在與化里，　地種花，建築台榭，賈島下第了，在他的怨憤中，題興化圓這詩却說「被却千家作一池，不栽桃李種薔薇；薔薇花落秋風起，荊棘滿庭君始知」，為了下第，這有點無聊。然我們可不管他，所想說的却是秋風起，花落了，荊棘滿庭這件事。在賈島一流的人物，是認為煞風景的，而且又沒有果實，所以愛桃李而不愛薔薇，他們那裏知道這正合廚用自村的缺陷之美」，沒有這荊棘滿庭，怎見得此花開時的好處？同時，花開了，有了利，有進却使那一般自命是愛花者—實在是摧殘花的姑娘小姐，公子哥兒們以一種意外的打擊。想採摘她，偶一不留心，指頭會被刺出血來，這眞是一件極快人心的事。唐朝儲光義的「薔嚴歌」中有句云「秦家女兒愛芳菲，盡眉相伴採戲莫；高處紅　欲就手，低邊綠刺已牽衣。爲我所愛誦的也就是綠刺牽衣這一點。</p>
<p>至於把薔薇製成薔薇水，灑衣經幾書不歇。（見宋史古城十國傳）那我雖愛薔薇，却並不連帶愛上薔薇不，因為她已失却了刺，保况一個人祗要身上不發出臾聞的味道得了，爲什麼却要使他香氣刺鼻的討人憐，逗人愛呢？</p>
<p>說到這裏，想起柳宗元的拍馬屁功夫。「雲仙雜說」說：「柳宗元得韓愈所寄詩，先以薔薇水盥手，然後發讀。」遂未免令人發笑，更要爲我所愛的薔微呼寃喊屈了。</p>

<h3 id="c43">一幕 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 雨言</p>
<p>姊　姊！掛號信！要你蓋章，是你校中寄來的。」漪文剛代替媽媽買了小菜回來，籃子還掛在手臂上，他的妹妹就拿了一封信，從下面跑上來。</p>
<p>「今年倒是早，往年總要相近開學才發聘書……大槪又是呌你去敎補習生了。」他媽媽正在房門口生煤爐，一邊搧着扇子，一邊咕囇着。</p>
<p>漪文是一個今年才二十二歲的姑娘，但是你們不要小看他，他已負起了一家三口的生活重担了，雖然是一個被人家唾棄的小學敎師，因他別處兼職，東拼西湊，每月倒也有若干收入，勉强支持一家子節儉的生活。</p>
<p>「現在男女一樣，都能養家，像我們阿漪，他不是養活了我們了嗎？」他母親常常在羣鄰中　耀他。他確是一個時代　的新女性。</p>
<p>漪文蓋好了章，把紙條送下去後，則很純熱的掑開信封，開始閱讀，他也以爲定是校長請他去任第二期暑期實習學校教師，記得去年也請到他，每天只教三個鐘點，學生又少，薪水倒比原來的大。去年他敎了暑期　，還替媽媽做了一件線袍子哩！</p>
<p>「五角五角一角，一元一角，姊姊，怎麼要這許多郵票，……啊約，績得太牢了，姊姊、你帮我掑下來好不好。」他的妹妹最歡喜郵票、漪文所有信件上的郵票，都被他撕去了。</p>
<p>妹妹在旁大聲嚷着，而漪文却不像平時那樣的去任應他，他的心亂跳了，頭發量了，在他眼前，即刻映出了一老一小、哭喪着臉向他跪着。</p>
<p>「媽媽！我沒有錯，你不能怨我。」漪文不由自主的火聲高呌，即刻倒在身旁的靠椅裏，正在搧煤爐的母親，被女兒突然的喊聲所驚，回頭一看，只見漪文躺在靠椅裏，兩眼閉着，面色發靑，嘴吧裏盡是說著求馓的話。</p>
<p>「啊呀呀！怎麼好？一定是買菜去犯了煞了，怎麼好呢？南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿……」他母親急得沒有辦法，亂唸南無阿彌陀佛，想求佛保佑。</p>
<p>幸而前樓李師母思想開通、對漪文媽說：唸佛是沒有用的。敎他用冷的濕手巾，覆在漪文額上，自己又去拿了一包仁丹來給他服下，這才把他漸漸淸醒過來，漪文睜開了兩眼，見床前站着的母親，不禁淚水直流，說：「媽媽！我沒有錯，你不能怨我。」</p>
<p>「好媛！好心將息將息，你要把媽嚇死了。</p>
<p>「顧家姆媽、漪妹妹的病不比尋常、看樣子，像是受了特殊的驚恐似的，你要安慰安慰他才對。」李師母在旁勸說着。</p>
<p>「有什麼驚恐？起來後才上小菜塲去走了一個……」</p>
<p>「媽！校中不要姊姊教書了。」還是小妹妹聰明，他去看了校中給姊姊的信後，在嬌耳邊輕輕的說。</p>
<p>素　來不善生病的漪文，躺在床上，實在有些耐不住，而况他還躭心着下半年的吃飯問題，所以第四天上他定要出去了，母親再也抑不過他。</p>
<p>不出去，不知實情，倒還可以阿Q式的過去，一出去，一知道底細，這眞要把他氣死了，原來有位火亭，介紹進三位敎師來，校長沒有地方安挿，就把漪文等沒有靠山的三個人解職了。</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？碰到了校長沒有？」漪文拖着沉重的脚步，踏進房門，母親就如此問他。</p>
<p>「沒有，「朝裏無人莫做官」。」</p>
<p>「你可以對校長說呀，你在他校中已敎了二年多了，又不做錯什麼事，爲何一下子就不要了。」</p>
<p>「早已有人了。」</p>
<p>「你不去說我央對他說：你也該替人家想想、無際無故的不要人家，這怎麼可以……就說你校中已無處安挿，那也得替人家介紹介紹，餓死了……」</p>
<p>「你去！這樣的服裝可以去見校長。」被女兒一說，向自已身上瞧瞧，這才想起了他自己時時說的一句話：「呌化子穿的衣服也要比我好了。」</p>
<p>室內寂靜，只有漪文的嗚咽聲及母親的嘆息聲。</p>

<p>— 海潔　旦樂</p>
<p>今春北星隊南下遠征，因打法墨守陳規，未能隨機應敵，不克靈展所長，一邁採用「人釘人」詭詐百出之滬上各隊，遂陷於苦鬥，屢遭敗衂。然其北派閃電式之進攻，奮鬥到底之精神，以及運動道德之良好，迄仍縈迥我人腦際，英雄固不足以成敗論也。茲者華北體友籃球隊繼北星而南來，麾下擁有國手多人，軍容壯盛。日前已在南京武進，吳興等地，略顯身手，旌旗所指，當者披靡。窺其實力，當在北星之上。該隊俱爲體校老搭檔，有三將亦前來滬之北呈隊員，北國健兒，素以苦幹著稱，鍛羽歸去，衷心耿耿，士別三日，便當刮目相看。此番再度蒞滬，自抱必勝決心，力圖一雪前恥。爲免蹈覆轍計，對於戰術，亦必經深加研討。則該隊之能一新我人耳目，在意料之中。</p>
<p>現該隊一行八人，已於昨午自蘇抵滬，本市籃球冠軍華聯隊領隊張溎祥，特派該隊名將范慶公吳成卓，赴站迎迓。因范君與該隊崔文仲常英郭湧恩，均係體專第五屆畢業生，他鄕遇故知，相見倍相親。當即下楊於四川路靑年會，午晚俱由張　祥歡宴。</p>
<p>介紹名將</p>
<p>該隊除常英郭湧恩郭耀嵩三君，曾於四月間代表北星南來，已經各報介紹外，其餘崔文仲趙守成王聖志王玉銘寶文英五君，茲爲介紹於後：</p>
<p>趙守成　三十歲，北京體專畢業，體友隊長。一九三五年與王鴻彬等，出席第一次中日滿運動大會。隊擅長籃球外，對於田徑運動，件件皆精。</p>
<p>崔文仲　二十七歲，北京體專畢業。現在保定宣傳處供職，曾出席中日滿運動大會，前年又出席滿洲運動會。一九三九年，曾代表母校，獲得萬國籃球賽冠軍，係華北名後衛。</p>
<p>五聖志　二十歲，北京師範大學三年級生，曾代表北京市，參加華北運動會多次，亦係北星隊隊員之一，上次北星南移，原擬隨隊同來，嗣因校方不允給假而罷。</p>
<p>竇文英　十九歲，北京中國大學高材生，曾代表北京中級組籃球，出席華北運動會多次，爲北方運動界後起之秀。</p>
<p>王玉銘　二十二歲，與實文英同學，中國大學足球隊健將，尤精籃球。其藝球姿態，頗有阿孔作風。</p>
<p>實力充沛</p>
<p>該隊昨曾至八仙橋靑年會試練身手，記者探悉實力，略爲介紹：</p>
<p>戰術方面，確已進展至聯防術及人釘人制並用，且以其衷氣之足，乃見頭頭是道。在南京連勝二塲，武進，吳縣亦俱奏凱歌。據云均採用人釘人，純熱之至。其個人方面，當英郭湧恩郭耀嵩三將，前北星表演中，我人日欣成，身任前鋒，智勇兼全，且能利用時機竄空檔，射擊京有把握，指揮三軍，不媿大將。後衛崔文仲準後衛，長射又稱拿手。此二將此次必能有美妙演出，餘如王勝治，王玉銘，竇文英輩，俱稱力壯，球藝有爐火純靑之境，而能注意隊的合作，尤爲可貴也。</p>
<p>該隊在滬戰程，今晚即將油隊開砲，惟究屬幾塲，或尙有問題。監聞除當局規定之數塲外，或另有南華北華兩新興隊伍，擬向之挑戰。故關於此點，請讀者注意體育消息網內。</p>
<h3 id="c46">排球發球時　限制躍起問題 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— （必賢）</p>
<p>上期記者曾發表關於排球發球時限制躍起問題之意見後，接到各個人方而致函記者甚多。各發表意見，摘錄下列四位原稿：</p>
<p>周家騏</p>
<p>排球發球不得跳起，係與網球同例的普通規則。規則本文，不甚顯著，確是事實。但如細辨文意，當可領會其有不准跳起之限制存在。（此規則在戰前曾有人提出問過，）「發球時（非發球前）球員之雙足應立於端綫之後」，意即在球擊着時，雙足須盖地，而跳起動作，俱在擊球以前利用的，（擊後跳起是無謂的動作，雙足離地，謂之跳起）。旣須立定，則不得跳起之意已明。</p>
<p>俞菊塵</p>
<p>我以爲是應根據「發球時球員之雙足，應立於端綫之後」之「應立於端綫之後」七字上，亦即意思變足任何一足，不能越過端綫。</p>
<p>汪世欽</p>
<p>運動規則與國家法律一樣，明文規定，不容假借，更不能含糊其詞，而用曲解。明乎此，則對於排球發球不准跳起問題，即可得一結論。旣然，規則中不曾規定不能跳起發球，則指此爲犯規者，究竟何所根據而云然。再進而言之，如譚永湛發球時，必立於端綫之後二步至三步，且行且擊，則請問何以不指以走步（Walking），而獨注意藉以略助臂力之一足離地（雙足離地擊球，事實上不可能）爲）跳起（Jumping）。况美國規則，亦甚跳起限制，則（Jumpeng）一字，殆滬上裁判之創作矣。</p>
<p>唐啓敏</p>
<p>排球裁判限制跳躍發球，曾與老友張樂研討。據云：「前遠東規則，原限制跳躍，後加以更改，即須注重。球未出手以前，任何一足凌空時，不能蹈入端綫之內」，於此可見最近裁判對於發球時稍有一足凌起，即四為跳起者，實有矯枉過正之嫌。</p>
<p>按上述四位，有裁判，或球員，或前輩，諸承賜敎。歸納起來，大致關於目下限制綦嚴之情形，確應有改革之必要。記者仍盼排球裁判會予我答覆</p>
<h3 id="c47">排球聯賽　最近形勢 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>排球聯賽自本週一（廿四日）男女各一塲大戰後，局勢已定，甲組粵華旣敗退俄僑甲，錦標殆已成慶中物，殆無異疑矣。女組綠隊力勝志騫後，目下當最佔優勢，希望濃厚，茲略叙最近形勢如左。</p>
<h3 id="c48">甲組大勢已定　粵華穩得錦標 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>粵華三戰三勝，心腹之患，亦已剷除，尙餘對。故奧華錦標似已獲得，誠屬可喜可賀，此應歸功於隊員之努力與夫蕭錫庚之領導有方，始克臻此。俄橋甲既敗於粵華，唯窺其實力，確甚强硬，再有二戰，當可保持勝利，奪取亞軍，必無問題。季軍一席，華影如能力圖振作調整二三排陣容，則頗有希望，如仍不加勤練隨意上陣，將讓諸與倖勝白隊之俄僑乙，白隊首戰不利，可勝不勝，怨敗於俄乙，或難逃殿軍矣。</p>
<h3 id="c49">女組志騫無靈　綠隊前途燦爛 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>女組本爲綠隊三省志驀三鼎足之局面，現綠隊旣殺敗志驚，故應暫列最優勢地位，以後難關，厥爲與三省之戰而已。以錢旭滄謝益欽兩君之肯用腦筋，調度得策，前途實爲燦爛。而三省亦尙保特不敗之紀錄。唯與志騫綠隊均未交鋒，要連渡兩難關，似較綠隊之希望略次。志騫唯一希望能打退三省，否則將騫居季軍。總之，對於冠軍，恐艱染指，正空勞吳益之一番心血。四五兩名，將爲西靑紅華嚴所爭。按實力西紅略勝，看精神羣嚴較好，則華嚴或能賴此以取勝，卸却黃也裹也。（必賢）</p>
<h3 id="c50">華影二籃球員　同時結婚 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>籃球圈裏誰不知道華影籃球隊的高反身（范生）因善用籃下反身投射，十有九中，因以得紅。更誰不知華影隊裏，新來一靑島市籃球代表小將車遙安。身手靈活，最近在紹興盃開幕賽中，壓倒明星隊，二君之功最多，原因無他，俱喜事冲冲也。</p>
<p>前日（二十六日）高車兩君同時舉行婚禮，在華國酒樓二樓，高反身的對象為吳喬華小姐，（華影公司職員）車小將的配偶，係女星王蒙納。此項消息，事前，極為秘密。但是曉得而到道賀者仍不少。計球壇方面，到有張覺非李寶中李震中，謝益欽等。電影界導演女星男星及話劇界陳璐等齊巧五十人。球星與影星相映，空氣熱鬧異常。筆者亦參與喜會，故略述一二花絮</p>
<p>新人報告　蘭根戲言</p>
<p>節目中輪到新。高范生起立正在嘻皮關險的報告，聽者動容的辰光。滑稽明星韓蘭根早偷偷地溜出去，怱怱地趕進來，一本正經地大喊「高范生，下面有一個大了肚皮的婦人，一路帶罵的來看你了」。一語甫完，全堂哄然，瘦猴不脫滑稽本性。</p>
<p>假裝假做　好個鐃頭</p>
<p>在賀客</p>
<p>敬酒聲中，高范生假裝醉意，想圖賴不飲，不是一個反身。兩手棒住了頭腦，酒全潑地，姿勢極美，好個鏡頭。車遙安假做剛拔牙齒，手指放於口內，眉愁臉苦，滴酒不肯下口，又是一個好饒頭。（靜端）</p>
<h3 id="c51">珍聞 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>滬上新興一個民女子籃球隊，均係名不經傳之新人，而成績甚佳，異常突起，提液後進，誠好消息也。</p>
<p>祝士芳程洪生在志鴍女排球隊勝了西靑紅隊，乃說似吃了「紅」棗湯。戰綠隊時，羣謂今日可大飲「綠」豆湯，不幸結果，橫遭慘敗，乃又去，綠豆湯價貴，改飯酸梅湯，聊以自慰。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: Promoting a Model District in Shanghai's Seven Counties <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality's administrative area includes three parts: the urban area, the suburban area, and the county area. The urban area includes the First District and Nanshi, and so on. The suburban area includes Jianghu, Hub North, Hu West, Qingdong, and other places. The county area includes seven counties: Baoshan, Shenjiang, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Jiading, and Chongming. Considering the above-mentioned areas, the city's administrative area is quite vast. We expect Shanghai to become a national political model area, which should include not only the urban area, but the entire municipal area encompassing the suburban and county areas. Therefore, when focusing on refreshing Shanghai's municipal administration, we should pay attention to the suburban and county areas in addition to the urban area.</p>
<p>The seven counties under the jurisdiction of this city are all relatively wealthy in terms of local economy. Each county can be self-sufficient in grain, and the folk customs are simple and honest, diligent, frugal, peaceful, and content. They already possess the objective conditions to become political model districts. If they are combined with a sound administrative system and capable experts, becoming model counties will not be a problem. Furthermore, the municipal government will implement a merger on August 1st to reorganize personnel. The urban area administration is also moving toward the goal of becoming a model district. In the future, the city's overall political structure will undoubtedly become a national model area. The only question is whether the authorities have the determination to do so.</p>
<p>What constitutes the authorities' determination? First, establishing the administrative system for each county and district. Second, improving the administrative personnel in each county and district. Third, reorganizing the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintaining the public security of each county and district. These will be further elaborated below:</p>
<p>First, the administrative system of each county should be established and improved based on the advantages and disadvantages of various systems adopted in the past, and with reference to the special local environment.</p>
<p>Second, it is particularly necessary to improve the administrative personnel of each county. If the administrative system is improved but the personnel are not, it will be like changing the soup without changing the ingredients, and the effect will still be zero. Improving the administrative personnel of the county begins with the selection of the county magistrate. We have discussed the importance of the selection of county magistrates in detail in the editorial on June 24. We said: "Currently, in the peaceful areas, there are not many instances of appointing county magistrates based on meritocracy. Most are appointed to accommodate local influential figures or incompetent people who seek positions through connections and bribery. Or those who barely understand Japanese are able to contact the Allied authorities, and they encourage and recommend people. These people have no political knowledge or administrative experience, and their motives are improper. Once they take office, they become even more arrogant, leading to local politics going astray and the people's suffering increasing." Therefore, the selection of county magistrates for the seven counties under the jurisdiction of this city should be particularly carefully considered, with the standard being those who have administrative experience, lofty ambitions, a spirit of hard work, and integrity. It has recently come to our attention that the current county magistrates of various counties and districts spend most of their time in the urban area in a month. Whether it is for business matters or for comfort, neither is appropriate. Secondly, the county officials and Baojia personnel must also be strictly selected and must meet the criteria of meritocracy.</p>
<p>Third, the financial revenue and expenditure of each county should be reorganized. First, harsh and miscellaneous taxes should be abolished to alleviate the people's difficulties. Appropriate taxes, such as land taxes, may be appropriately increased based on actual needs. In principle, what is taken from the local area should be used for the local area.</p>
<p>Fourth, the establishment of public security is an absolute guarantee for effective administration. If public security cannot be established, all administrative measures will only increase disturbances and will not be effective. The so-called public security means that the local military and police take protecting the people as their mission. Not only should they absolutely not disturb the people themselves, but they must also eliminate any evil forces that may disturb the people. The implementation of "Qingxiang" (rural cleansing) should be a temporary emergency measure and should not be regarded as a regular task, so as to avoid many malpractices.</p>
<p>The above four points are interdependent, and should be coordinated and implemented in parallel without neglecting any of them. Only when the seven counties in Shanghai become model counties can the bad environment in the suburbs of Shanghai be changed and the security of the entire Shanghai be protected. Before the municipal government implements the merger and actively refreshes municipal facilities, we have infinite expectations for the improvement of county and district administration.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Geological Authority Discovers Tantalum Ore, A New Contribution to Scientific Weapons <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram from Osaka) - Dr. Minetaro Takakubo, an authority on geology at Kyoto Imperial University, along with Keikichi Koda, Masatake Tsujiki, Junichiro Tamaki, and others, recently discovered a rare element tantalum ore deposit. Tantalum ore contains tantalum, niobium, yttrium, and other minerals, and is an indispensable rare element for the production of scientific weapons. Therefore, this discovery is a great contribution. The ore deposit was found near an area with production rights, but it had been abandoned until now. It grows between feldspar and columnar stone. The United States only extracted less than one ton in 1931. The wireless direction finders that proved effective during the first air raid in the United Kingdom, and the unmanned aircraft that Germany still relies on, cannot do without this pure element. The successful analysis of this element by Japanese scholars is an unprecedented new contribution.</p>

<h3 id="e7">National Government Actively Promotes Rural Construction <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) - This year is a year of increased production. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, strengthen the foundation of the nation, and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, actively increasing production is truly urgent. To catch up and truly and solidly promote increased production, especially at a time when food prices are soaring and rice is more precious than pearls, the most important and first effort should naturally be to increase grain production, as "the people regard food as their heaven." Here, we will first examine the reasons for today's so-called food panic. The main reason is that the countryside is unstable, so agriculture is declining. Under these circumstances, if we want to talk about increasing agricultural production, then the comprehensive and active promotion of rural construction is really the most urgent task that should be started first. Therefore, the "Outline of the Rural Construction Plan" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council this time is truly a wise policy that recognizes the key points. From this, we can know that the National Government authorities not only have the determination to "build the countryside and strengthen production increase," but have also formulated a plan outline to provide specific instructions, and have decided to organize a "Rural Construction Implementation Committee" to preside over the overall affairs of promoting rural construction. Here, we can assert that the success of rural construction will definitely achieve the goal of increasing production, thereby stabilizing people's livelihoods. Under a strong and stable foundation, cooperation with the Greater East Asia War will naturally be stronger and more powerful. Originally, in this world where the whole world is at war, talking about construction, especially China's rural construction, is naturally not an easy task, but because of this, it is even more necessary to overcome all difficulties and complete construction from hardship and difficulty, which is the most effective and meaningful. As an example, the foreign country Japan, under this Greater East Asia War, can become stronger and stronger because it can achieve active production increase and has achieved self-sufficiency from the original food shortage. The reason for this, on the one hand, is of course due to the enthusiastic efforts of Japanese farmers during the war, but on the other hand, is it not because Japan's rural construction has already had a perfect scale? From this, we can look back at our agricultural production increase. Why can't we achieve remarkable results? Why are we still shouting about soaring food prices and food panic? The reason is that our countryside has not been able to achieve stability under this war, so there is even less talk about construction. Therefore, this time we have infinite expectations for the "Rural Construction Implementation Committee" to promote rural construction affairs based on the "Outline of the Rural Construction Plan." I believe that not only can we achieve the goal of this year's "Year of Increased Production," but we will also lay the foundation for China's rural construction.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th: The offensive of the First Ukrainian Front of the Soviet Union has extended to the Stanislav region on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains. Currently, the Eastern Front is unfolding in an area of approximately one thousand kilometers from Pskov to Stanislav. The Soviet army has launched an offensive from Pskov beyond Dvinsk to the northern region of Kovno. According to Berlin news, Soviet troops advancing south from Dvinsk towards the Baltic Sea have reached A island between Riga and Kovno railway, indicating the urgency of the situation. Furthermore, German troops in the Kovno to Bialystok region are fighting fiercely outside the borders of White Russia to prevent Soviet reinforcements. In the past few days, the Soviet army has launched offensives, but it is reported that the Soviet army has been forced to retreat to the west bank of the Narew River. The situation in the Bukiel-Mabul region, north of Brest-Litovsk and west of Lenbierk, is now one-by-one. The intensity of the Soviet offensive cannot be directly compared with other areas. In that area, the Soviet target is to reach the Vistula River defense line. Currently, the Soviet army is linking Sokolov, Treliepan, and Linlinislav into a single line. Soviet troops in the Yaroslavl area have crossed the San River, a tributary of the Vistula River. According to information obtained by neutral countries, the Soviet offensives west of Roblin and west of Kitlier are extremely fierce, especially the Soviet advance on Watersiya. Therefore, the German army has no other option but to retreat to the Vistula River defense line to launch a counteroffensive.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Great Shanghai Administrative Institutions Achieve Unification: District Public Offices Merged into the Municipal Government on August 1st <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>On August 1st of last year, thanks to the gracious assistance of our ally Japan, we received the Shanghai International Settlement. The French Concession was also returned to our country at the same time. At that time, two district public offices, the First and Eighth, were established to separately receive the administrative powers of the former two concessions. On February 1st of this year, the former Eighth District Public Office was ordered to be abolished. All administrative affairs of that district were placed under the management of the First District Public Office. Thus, the boundaries of the former two concessions were completely eliminated, greatly benefiting the unification of the municipal government. August 1st of this year marks the first anniversary of the return of the concessions. The municipal authorities, recognizing the duplication of Shanghai's municipal institutions and the need to expedite municipal unification, after repeated discussions with the central government and relevant parties, decided to relocate the municipal government to the First District Public Office on Jiangxi Road on August 1st. The highest administrative organ of the Shanghai Special Municipality, once located in the city center, will naturally attract the attention of citizens, and at the same time, the form of the concessions will disappear without a trace. In order to understand the truth of this matter, the reporter specifically visited Municipal Secretary-General Wu, who kindly informed us of the various confirmed plans in detail. The key points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Jurisdictional Area</p>
<p>1.  The division of the jurisdictional area of the Shanghai Special Municipality: Urban Area: 1. Old First District (including the former Eighth District, areas merged from West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Jiangwan); 2. Old Seventh District (i.e., the former Seventh District of the South City District, the fat bureau abolished); 3. Part of the area merged from West Shanghai; 4. Part of the area merged from East Pudong (area along the Huangpu River). Suburban Area: 1. Jiangwan District (i.e., the former city center and part of Wusong); 2. North Shanghai District; 3. West Shanghai District; 4. Northeast Pudong District; 5. Southeast Pudong District. The above five districts will continue to be administered by the district public offices. County Area: 1. Binshan County; 2. Shenjiang County (i.e., the former Beiqiao Special District); 3. Nanhui County; 4. Chuansha County; 5. Fengxian County; 6. Jiading County; 7. Chongming County. The above seven counties, which were converted from the former special districts into county administrations, are temporarily under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, and two administrative inspectors will be dispatched by the central government to supervise the above seven counties in different areas.</p>
<p>Map of the Shanghai Special Municipality Urban Area</p>
<p>Organization of Institutions</p>
<p>2.  The various institutions affiliated with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government: The municipal government will move to the First District Public Office on August 1st. The First District Public Office will be abolished on that day, and its original departments will be merged with the existing bureaus and offices of the municipal government according to their nature, and will be reorganized into the following bureaus and offices: Police Bureau (the First and Second Police Bureaus will be merged into the Police Bureau), Finance Bureau, Economic Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Land Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, Education Bureau, Propaganda Office, and Materials Allocation Office.</p>
<p>3.  The internal organization of the municipal government: The mayor will still be under the leadership of a secretary-general, and several secretaries and confidential secretaries will be appointed. One of the confidential secretaries will be specially appointed as the chief secretary to assist the secretary-general in handling affairs. The secretariat will establish four groups, three sections, and three offices in terms of administrative affairs and technology to take charge of their respective duties. In addition, the municipal government's original Economic Advisory Office and Counselor's Office will also be relocated to the First District Office.</p>
<p>Office Locations</p>
<p>4.  The office locations of the municipal government and various bureaus and offices: The entire building of the First District Public Office was built by the former Public Works Bureau. Although the internal facilities are very complete, it is not feasible to move all the bureaus into it. Therefore, the various institutions affiliated with the municipal government have decided to be located in three locations: the First District Public Office, the original site of the municipal government, and the former Eighth District. Located in the original First District Public Office: 1. Mayor's Office, 2. Secretary-General's Office, 3. Secretariat, 4. Counselor's Office, 5. Economic Advisory Office, 6. Finance Bureau, 7. Public Works Bureau, 8. Health Bureau. The Economic Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Propaganda Office, and Materials Allocation Office are located in the former Eighth District Public Office. The Land Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, and Education Bureau are located in the original site of the former municipal government. The locations of the Police Bureau and the Security Office will remain the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the municipal government moves to the city center, the personnel benefits, job assignments, and internal department establishment will be appropriately adjusted to meet the principle of administrative economy.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Various Organizations Prepare to Commemorate the Late Minister Zhang: Ceremony Set for August 18th <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yunbo unfortunately passed away on the 15th of this month due to overwork. His virtues during his lifetime have always been admired by the public. Whether serving society or politics, he always set an example, so he was regarded as a model by officials and civilians. This spring, he resolutely came out of retirement and took charge of the Ministry of Judicial Administration for six months, rectifying and reorganizing it with all his efforts. The National Government relied on him as a pillar of strength, but he succumbed to overwork. Not only did the country lose this pillar, but society also lost a mentor. Recalling his achievements and reputation, people at home and abroad mourn him in unison. In order to commemorate Mr. Zhang, the various public organizations in this city, initiated by the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, jointly with the Citizens Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Suzhou Native Place Association Reorganization Committee, and the Shanghai News Federation, are jointly preparing a memorial service. The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday at the Thrift Association, with dozens of people attending, including Wen Lanting, Yu Liang, Chen Jiufeng, Lu Feng, Wan Xuefang, and Ren Yunpeng. Gu Nanqun was elected as the temporary chairman. The key issues discussed and resolved are as follows: Name: Mr. Zhang Yunbo Memorial Service; Date: August 18th at 4 pm; Location: Auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Method of participating in the memorial service: Each agency and public organization should notify the blood-making office in writing before the end of this month. (Temporarily located in the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, 3rd Floor, 160 Great Shanghai Road); Method of receiving gifts: Gifts from all sectors should be in cash in principle, and wreaths and other items are declined. If there are elegiac couplets or evening couplets, only the text needs to be copied and sent to the preparatory office for compilation and printing in the memorial special issue. Method of distributing the cash gifts: All proceeds, except for expenses, will be used as subsidies for education and general charitable public welfare undertakings. Important personnel of the preparatory office: Director of preparation: Wen Lanting; Deputy directors: Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing; Secretary-General: Lu Feng; Deputy Secretary-General: Ren Yunpeng; Representatives of organizations: Zhao Jinqing and Xiang Kangyuan of the Citizens Welfare Association; Gu Nanqun and Funatsu Tatsujiro of the Federation of Industry and Commerce; Wu Kaisheng and Liu Yunfang of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association; Gong Ziyu and Wu Song of the Suzhou Native Place Association Reorganization Committee; Chen Binhe and Ozaka Yoichi of the Shanghai News Federation; Jin Zongcheng and He Wuliang of the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Unified Tax Collection on Mixed Fiber Textiles <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the collection of unified cotton yarn tax goods was originally limited to cotton yarn and cotton yarn directly woven products. However, due to the special circumstances of the current wartime, it has recently been found that various Chinese and foreign yarn factories that have been subject to the unified tax are facing a shortage of raw materials and a decline in production. They have temporarily mixed various miscellaneous fibers with waste batting, rags, foot flowers, waste silk, hemp wool, etc., with cotton to spin and weave various mixed yarns and woven products for factory shipment and sales to maintain the livelihoods of workers. In order to be considerate of the hardships of merchants and to maintain the industrial point of view, the department has formulated a method: all such mixed yarns and their directly woven products, regardless of the content of raw cotton and miscellaneous woven fiber components, shall be calculated based on their weight, distinguished by count, and the length and width of their interwovenness and the warp and weft yarns, etc., shall be compared with the official purchase price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to determine the value. The unified cotton yarn tax shall be levied at a tax rate of 5% ad valorem in accordance with the cotton yarn unified tax regulations and the accumulated levy process, and a tax bill of cotton yarn or cotton yarn directly woven products shall be issued to facilitate transportation and sales. After being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval, all bureaus and offices are specially notified to follow the procedures. Subsequently, all yarn factories can register the aforementioned mud-mixed miscellaneous woven fiber textiles that have been applied for and approved in accordance with the regulations and issue them for sale. Those that are being manufactured but have not been registered, or those that are still under preparation, should quickly fill in and submit the table form to the department for registration in accordance with the regulations for cotton yarn and cloth product registration. After determining the value and the amount of tax payable, the tax will be paid before shipment and sale, so as to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p>The method for the Rice and Grain Control Committee to reorganize old orders for the purchase of rice and grain has been approved by the Executive Yuan and promulgated and implemented on June 23. Items A and B of the method stipulate that those who have ordered and received funds but have not yet delivered a single grain of rice must deliver half of the amount by July 15 and the full amount by August 15. Those who have ordered and received funds and have delivered half of the amount, regardless of whether they continue to borrow the second half of the funds, must deliver the full amount of their order by August 15. It has been found that there are many merchants in various places who have complied with the regulations, but there are still many who have not delivered a single grain of rice. As of now, the total amount of rice owed, calculated according to the total amount of orders, has exceeded two-thirds. Those who have not complied and have no special reasons will be transferred to the relevant local orders or courts for punishment in accordance with the law, and their guarantors will also be subject to joint and several punishment.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance revised and promulgated the Interim Measures for Stamp Duty in Extraordinary Times, the merchants and people of this city have complied with the laws and regulations and affixed stamps as required, so that the purchasers of stamps from the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau have become increasingly crowded, and some illegal elements have resold stamps at a premium on the black market, which is illegal. The bureau has strictly investigated this matter and, in order to protect merchants and the public from extra losses, has stipulated that anyone who purchases stamps for more than 1,000 yuan from the bureau must have a certificate from a formal store or institution, otherwise, they will not be allowed to purchase them to prevent fraud and to support merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Science and Technology Symposium: Technology Disclosure and Enterprise <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Inamura: In the context of technology disclosure, are the rewards for those who disclose, or for the enterprise itself?</p>
<p>Bito: This point is something our members are very indifferent to. Members are carrying out technology disclosure work every day. In collective design workshops, it is often said, "You do it!" If there's a little success, you do it! Please, you do it! Taking someone else's design drawings to work, such technology disclosure is really rare in the world. Everyone doesn't pay attention to bonuses, but only knows how to cooperate openly with each other.</p>
<p>Inamura: However, there are times when Company A produces a very good product, which is the result of many years of hard research. Companies B, C, D, etc., can't catch up with this achievement no matter what. In this situation, if the technology is disclosed, there is a risk of losing Company A's uniqueness or the excellence of the enterprise. In such very important situations, some may doubt whether the most important part of the industry can be disclosed, but in reality, I think it is possible.</p>
<p>Bito: In the field of industrial machinery, it seems to be the most problematic. Although I dare not say whether it is good or bad, in the field of machine tools, guilds have been established for several years. Since that time, everyone has been very happy about technology disclosure. Among practitioners, everyone discloses unconditionally to each other. As for other aspects, many problems arise. If the conditions are not met, large companies are unwilling to disclose. I don't understand this psychological state. Naturally, this is the production process, which is a production process in a certain sense. For example, with the use of synthetic kerosene machinery, even the production process is disclosed. Of course, when handing over such machinery, one would think of handing over everything to others, but in reality, it is doing common things together. Even if it is not doing common things together, but among factories doing different individual work, if technology is disclosed, this is truly for the country. If money is attached to disclosure, it will only spoil things. Most companies are like this nowadays.</p>
<p>Inamura: This may not be a few exceptions! Perhaps all industries in Japan are like this.</p>
<p>Bito: It's not quite nationwide!</p>
<p>Hanada: Within the narrow scope I know, aircraft production is progressing very well. Also, when the Navy participates, it goes very smoothly. So I think it can proceed smoothly in practical matters. Of course, it is the same nationwide. Also, it is progressing very satisfactorily. On the national level, consideration should certainly be given to what form of recognition and how much monetary reward should be given, but until now, many good stories have been heard. However, technology disclosure is not reckless.</p>
<p>In addition, technical guidance was conducted at the Technical Institute last year, and it is still continuing this year. For example, everyone knows that the Lubrication Technology Research Institute has been established. The work Mr. Duan Cun is engaged in, the oil used in the factory, only requires a quarter or a fifth of what was used in the past, which is truly a new era. It has increased Japan's total oil volume by three or four times, which is truly a miracle. If you compare the reward with the result, there is a real sense of inferiority, but the person is working happily. Now it has become a research institute of a public interest corporation. In terms of materials, the Technical Institute helps so there are no obstacles.</p>
<p>Recently, wooden boats have begun to be manufactured, which is also under the technical leadership of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and technical personnel are also participating in and helping with technical aspects. Therefore, it has recently received praise from all sides. Currently, general urban and rural casting factories, whenever production cannot be improved, are given technical guidance by Ikebei Iron Works in Tokyo, Kubota Iron Works in Kansai, or Mr. Ishikawa of the Yahata Iron and Steel Research Institute. If the benefits obtained in this way are calculated, the reward is truly minimal. However, everyone who is working does not care about the reward, and is happy to work. So any unnecessary worry is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Inamura: I will examine it again from the perspective of government offices and officials, or from the control association and the government. Standing in the position of the actual practitioner, I don't think it's like that at all. There are still obstacles to technology disclosure. For example, there is such a real example in the Liunao industry. I believe that solving this unwillingness to separate is not a matter of raising the national consciousness of scientists and technicians, or a psychological problem. But the prerequisite is the merger of enterprises in the most concrete economic organization, in which case the problem of technology disclosure will be readily solved, so it is not a problem of concept and psychology, but a problem of enterprise merger from the perspective of economic organization.</p>
<p>Hanaoka: These ten points are issues that must be considered from the national level.</p>
<p>Reporter: If we study the issue of enterprise consolidation that Mr. Inamura just mentioned, the problem will be big.</p>
<p>Inamura: Taking a German example, the German dye companies were extremely opposed to each other and competed with each other, so an organization called IG was established to adjust the whole situation. The person who put in the most effort for this work was Dusburg, which caused unprecedented development in technology. How did this come about? This is not simply the self-awareness of German scientists. It is the merger of enterprises that creates the phenomenon of technology exchange. In this regard, I believe that the current situation in Japan is not yet sufficient.</p>
<p>Ohashi: Speaking of technology disclosure, there are also various forms. There are those related to manufacturing methods, those related to equipment, those related to design drawings, and those related to experience and skill, etc. Among them, those related to equipment, those related to design drawings, etc., because they are the property of the company, it is very difficult to disclose them without compensation. In the liberal country of the United States, many co-operators have their own exclusive rights, and stipulate exclusive profits. Member associations can enjoy exclusive privileges for co-operators. In addition, members pay exclusive implementation fees to a group or a public alliance group. The latter distributes the implementation fees according to the production volume of each member. This is the exclusive profit, and the purpose is to monopolize the market with the group. In totalitarian Germany, enterprises that produce the same type of military supplies form a production group called a guild (Ring). The person in charge of the guild provides guidance and implements technology disclosure work. The exclusive patent fee is from the state. From one to several hundred, it is a few percent; from several hundred to several hundred, it is a few percent. In this way, the method of progressive taxation is implemented, and the result is free. This method is used to compensate. As long as technicians and enterprises put serving the nation first, it is of course not allowed to have permanent monopoly. In Japan, we have formed the Synthetic Kerosene Manufacturing Technology Association for the synthetic kerosene industry, and the organization with the most achievements is the one that has created public disclosure work like Han Xuan Zhuan Fei. This is a way to make official technology freely available. The biggest problem with technology disclosure is the issue of compensation. Although the past research expenses can be fully clarified, the estimated profits from technology monopoly are judged from a very thorough standpoint, which I think is necessary. However, it is not permissible to write off the creative designs of excellent enterprises, so special consideration should be given to the price policy. The Nazi military procurement price is determined according to the average actual price of the previous year. The greater the production efficiency, the greater the profit. I don't quite understand it, but I only know that the invention and design of enterprises are cleverly stimulated with exclusive rights compensation fees and this kind of price policy.

<h3 id="e35">Outline of Rural Construction Plan <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th Central News Agency Electric (Continued from yesterday) Specific measures for the second experimental county: (A) Establish a Rural Construction Promotion Committee as a planning, deliberation, and supervision agency for rural construction. This committee shall be composed of the county magistrate as the chairman, the heads of various sections of the county government, rural construction instructors, the director of the training institute, one representative from the rural construction guidance center, one representative from the county branch of the cooperative, one representative from agricultural-related organizations, one representative from educational circles, and several representatives from knowledgeable town and township chiefs. When necessary, the battalion commander of the security team and representatives of other relevant agencies may be hired as consultants.</p>
<p>Establish a Rural Construction Instructor Training Institute to cultivate middle-level talents who can shoulder the important task of rural construction. Hire people in the county who are well-known, have high moral character, and are excellent in ability as the director. Its事业 is as follows: Train rural cadres and youth. A number of youths from the county are accommodated in the dormitory of the institute for a certain period of time, and they are given integrated military and agricultural training. At the same time, they are made to understand the concept of rural construction. After the training is completed, they are returned to their hometowns to cooperate with various agencies such as township offices, Baojia cooperatives, and youth leagues, in order to become the central figures or assistants of each village's self-government, self-defense, self-sufficiency, and self-generation. If there are particularly outstanding youths, they will be re-educated and then opened up for them to become staff members of rural construction guidance centers or county government staff. The training of rural cadres and youths should pay attention to the following points: (A) Implement farm internships to cultivate the spirit of hard work. (B) Provide on-site guidance to make them understand agricultural technology. (C) Basic training on rural self-defense. (D) Training on rural autonomy and rural economy, including cooperative guidance. (E) Elucidate the construction concepts of the New China and Greater East Asia. (F) The education of the institute should make full use of films, specimens, etc. as teaching materials, and often invite celebrities from all walks of life to give lectures.</p>
<p>Implement short-term training for rural elders, teachers, and county officials, so that rural elders can understand the ideals of the cadre youth, so as to advance together with the youth cadres towards the path of rural construction, and at the same time enable teachers and county officials to provide assistance and support from the side.</p>
<p>Operate experimental fields and specimen gardens. Operate experimental fields and specimen gardens in a part of the affiliated farm so that trainees and the general public can see and hear them in practice. Establish a rural construction guidance center within the excellent agricultural technology. This center is attached to the rural construction instructor training institute. The director of the training institute concurrently serves as the director in principle. Its undertakings are as follows: (A) Organize a rural construction guidance team. The guidance team can be divided into autonomy and defense teams, and can contact cooperatives, cotton production improvement associations, schools, etc. to guide each other. (B) Operation of the patrol diagnosis team. This team patrols rural areas to conduct medical and rural health investigations. This task can be entrusted to relevant medical and public groups in the county. (C) Operation of the patrol comfort team. Films are shown and dramas and Quyi are performed in rural areas at any time to provide rural comfort. (D) Raise superior seeds, seedlings, and agricultural tools.</p>
<p>The implementation of the above undertakings must embody the intentions of the Rural Construction Committee. Integrate with the county government, and pay special attention to the following three items to strive for their realization: The rural self-defense regiment fully achieves the purpose of security. Cooperatives give full play to the functions of the central institutions for rural economic construction. Labor takes farmers' welfare as its ideal and strives to strengthen the county's political governance</p>
<p>Organize a village-protecting model team, select youths who have completed training at the Rural Construction Instructor Training Institute or other similar institutions, and organize a village-protecting model youth league. The wood regiment is stationed in the county government or important places in the county, and is responsible for defending the villages and important institutions in the county. When this group develops and strengthens, the existing security team members can be gradually reduced. The term of service for team members is one year. During the service period, food and clothing are provided, and allowances are given. After the service is completed, a special honor is given to increase their feelings of attachment to this idea. Outstanding team members may be assigned to the National Government Guard Army, lower-level officers, or soldiers according to their personal wishes.</p>
<p>Reform the tax system and reduce the burden of harsh taxes, so that the economic power of farm families will naturally increase, and the dependence of farmers on the administrative authorities will inevitably become stronger. Take this as an opportunity to change the land tax to a payment-in-kind system, or change it to a valuation of actual objects, to seek to reorganize various miscellaneous taxes. Strengthen the financial foundation of the provincial government and the central government. Although there are many conveniences in the land tax payment-in-kind system, at the same time, the first step should be to start with experimental counties, and gradually promote it to other places depending on its success. Innovate administrative governance and security and establish increased production, so that there is hope for improving the treatment and quality of county government specialists, and the renewal of county administration can be expected. In addition, if the system of deputy county magistrate is implemented, several people are recommended by the township head as candidates, and after consultation between the central government and the provincial government, one of the candidates is designated as the deputy county magistrate, in order to reflect the intentions and interests of the township party in the general county administration, this should also be considered.</p>
<p>Third, institutions within the central government and provincial government. (A) Establish a National Rural Construction Promotion Committee, tentatively named to comprehensively plan, deliberate, investigate, assist, and promote national rural construction matters, and seek liaison between relevant institutions. Set up a Rural Construction Promotion Committee in the Executive Yuan. The President of the Executive Yuan shall serve as the chairman, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan shall serve as the vice chairman, and the ministers of internal affairs, finance, education, industry, propaganda, construction, social welfare, and the director of the Health Department, the governors of various provinces, the special mayor, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, the secretary-general of the National Economic Commission, the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, and the chairman of the Cooperative Affairs Committee shall form the committee. Under this committee, a secretariat is set up to manage deliberation matters and rectify affairs. This secretariat is formed by the vice ministers of internal affairs, finance, education, industry, propaganda, construction, social welfare, one secretary of the National Economic Commission, the director of the Department of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, the Department of Industry, the secretary-general of the Cooperative Affairs Committee, and the secretary-general of the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee. All committee and secretariat meetings may invite economic consultants and representatives to attend the meetings when necessary.</p>
<p>(B) Establish a Rural Research Expert Committee. Establish a Rural Construction Research Expert Committee within the National Economic Commission to investigate and study matters concerning rural construction and study the trends of the rural social and economic situation. Before the National Rural Construction Promotion Committee is established, it may act on behalf of a part of the committee's undertakings. The secretary-general of the National Economic Commission shall be the chairman of the research expert committee, relevant personnel from various ministries and committees shall be specialized members of the research expert committee, and from among the specialized members, the chairman of the committee shall designate three to five people as secretaries. When necessary, branch offices may be established in various provinces and cities, with the mayors of the provinces and cities serving as the chairmen of the branch offices.</p>
<p>Conclusion, in short, this matter is of great importance, and governance depends on people. First, we must select outstanding talents such as county magistrates, farmer instructors, and trainers. Second, the central government and the provincial government must form an integral whole under the grand concept of building a new China society and move forward, and then the rural construction cause will begin to be realized. This is truly a major key to determining the future destiny of the Chinese nation and society. Both the government and the public should focus their efforts on this. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e38">From Restaurants to Thrift and Extravagance <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Chen He</p>
<p>The implementation of wartime national banquet restrictions shows that the authorities are determined to abolish the bad habit of luxury and extravagance among the people. The purpose is to adapt to the wartime system and practice thrift. The principle is that banquets are not allowed for birthdays, moves, engagements, funerals, and birthdays under the age of 60, and luxury and noble items such as shark fins, bird's nests, and bear paws are not allowed. Last time, the authorities had already promulgated laws and regulations prohibiting higher-end restaurants from selling meals and limiting drinking hours, and the business of restaurants suddenly became deserted. After the announcement of this outline, it will fall even further. From the standpoint of wartime thrift movement, there is nothing wrong with it, but there is room for discussion in terms of the inevitable closure of restaurants that cannot operate.</p>
<p>There are quite a few restaurants in Shanghai that are modernly managed; and they also have considerable value in terms of food hygiene. For example, they have taken into consideration fresh selection of ingredients, flavorful cooking, clean layout, and attentive service, etc., which were neglected by old-fashioned restaurants. In addition, the organization of new-style restaurants adopts a division of labor and cooperation system, dividing them into kitchens, canteens, accounting rooms, and warehouses, and the capital invested is also huge. All of this comes from the experience of restaurant industry leaders over the years, but unfortunately the leadership has not been fully effective, resulting in the current trend of luxury and extravagance. It is hoped that the leaders of the industry will shift their focus, cater to government policies, cooperate with wartime systems and thrift societies, curb the atmosphere of luxury and extravagance, and seek to continue to make more valuable inventions in food.</p>
<p>The question of how to use the materials that are prohibited in the outline of national banquet restrictions and that are currently stored in the warehouses of various restaurants, or whether to allow them to be naturally damaged and eliminated, is a question that deserves consideration. In order to adapt to the current system and implement thrift in materials, we cannot allow them to be naturally damaged, and there should be proper measures to deal with them. For example, if restaurants are willing to sell abalone, bird's nest, shark fins, bear paws, etc., they should register with the relevant authorities, and ask them to approve the price for public sale, or distribute them to various restaurants for use, so as to avoid the corruption of materials and the loss of capital. The price approved by the fair agency should also be similar to the price of other fish and meat, and it is not extravagant. This does not harm the principle of thrift in materials in the national banquet restriction regulations.</p>
<p>Luxury and extravagance have become a trend, and its potential power is lurking in all directions, making it difficult to eradicate. Not only higher-end restaurants have this trend. For example, if large restaurants decline or even close down due to the festival banquet movement, then cafes will rise to take their place. The capital invested exceeds that of restaurants, and the degree of luxury and extravagance is even more excessive. In terms of the value of food, everyone knows that it is just a waste, and it is too far from the wartime system. The authorities have not prevented it, but allowed it to develop. This shows that the potential power of luxury and extravagance is still extremely ingrained. Merely adding laws to restaurants, even if they are suffocated and close down, will not have any effect on the entire example of the thrift movement, and the sale and practice of wartime life will still not be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Record of the Decisive Battle Between Japanese and American Fleets in the Mariana Sea <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In mid-June, centered around the Mariana Islands, the Japanese and American fleets engaged in an unprecedented naval battle. The Japanese fleet's air force launched a preemptive strike on the morning of June 19th, immediately achieving a great victory by destroying several American aircraft carriers. Subsequently, due to the Japanese side's twilight attacks, night raids, and submarine activity, the battle results gradually expanded. However, the war situation has become increasingly serious due to this naval battle, so it is necessary to thoroughly enhance combat power from all aspects.</p>
<p>On June 〇〇, a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet believed that the time to annihilate the enemy fleet had arrived and completed its attack posture. The enemy's strength was said to have more than ten battleships, about ten standard aircraft carriers, more than ten escort aircraft carriers, and in addition, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., totaling no less than one hundred ships. This shows that they have drawn most of the Pacific naval forces, relying on a vast number unprecedented in naval history, to invade the Japanese defense line. From June 11th to 18th, they drove their carrier-based aircraft, boasting a total of more than one thousand, to bomb Japanese air bases in various parts of the Mariana Islands. Then, they drove their surface warships close to the islands and carried out naval bombardment, finally landing on Saipan Island on the 15th. Regarding this arrogant and disrespectful attitude, the Japanese army exercised restraint and self-respect, remaining calm and collected. While the base troops devoted all their efforts to defense, a part of the Combined Fleet gathered in 〇〇 and quietly completed the deployment of operational arrangements.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of 〇〇, the commander of the Japanese troops issued instructions, saying, "Our troops are about to embark on the magnificent journey of annihilating the enemy fleet. All members must devote their full efforts." All crew members of the entire fleet, from the captain to the ordinary soldiers, enthusiastically prepared for battle, hoping to return in triumph from this battle.</p>
<p>From dawn on the 18th, everyone was fully armed, hoping to meet the enemy. However, because the time was not yet ripe, although the enemy's situation had been scouted, they still held back and advanced towards the sea area where the American fleet was cruising.</p>
<p>Preemptive Strike</p>
<p>The 19th was the day of the decisive battle. Before dawn, search planes had already set off. The sky was sparkling with stars. Before long, the east turned white, and the brilliant morning light illuminated the waves of the South Sea. Today was the day of the first battle between a large fleet and a large fleet in the Pacific. Soon, the search plane discovered the enemy's mobile force and began to make contact.</p>
<p>It was reported that the enemy ships were sailing in the sea west of the Mariana Islands, in three groups. The first group consisted of four standard aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The second group consisted of three standard aircraft carriers, five battleships, and more than ten other ships. The third group consisted of one standard aircraft carrier, two special aircraft carriers, and about ten other ships. At the same time, telegrams reporting the situation of other enemy mobile forces were also sent in succession.</p>
<p>The time had come! Japanese warplanes took off one after another. The magnificent large formation soared above the fleet, the Japanese emblems on the wings reflecting the morning light, particularly beautiful. The personnel on the warships waved their arms and hats, cheering loudly, wishing them a speedy return. After the first batch of carrier-based aircraft took off, a sudden storm broke out, and the sea suddenly lost its calm.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't be able to take off any later!" The personnel on the warships couldn't help but thank God for his blessing.</p>
<p>After that, the second formation, the third formation... took off one after another. In the meantime, the fleet carried out strict alert navigation, advancing all the way through the waves.</p>
<p>The number of fighters escorting the enemy's mobile force was extremely large, laying down a three- or four-layered defense network. It would take superhuman strength just to break through this tight defense.</p>
<p>"We must break through the defense network!"</p>
<p>"It would be great if we could bomb the aircraft carriers!"</p>
<p>Everyone silently prayed for success while anxiously waiting for news of victory from the attack aircraft squadron. At 〇〇:〇〇, the receiving machine received a telegram from the commander of the attack aircraft squadron to his subordinates: "All aircraft, a decisive attack!" At the same time, a telegram reporting that "Currently in aerial combat over the enemy" was received.</p>
<p>"Ah ha, they're at it!"</p>
<p>Just after swallowing a mouthful of saliva to moisten their dry throats, they received a report of "One enemy standard aircraft carrier hit"; it was hit by a 〇〇 kg bomb. Following that, news of victory came one after another, confirming that more than three enemy aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The first preemptive strike was a success!</p>
<p>The loudspeaker broadcast the news of victory to every corner of the ship, and morale became even higher.</p>
<p>Starting from 〇〇, the attack aircraft squadron returned in order, and were recovered along with the reconnaissance aircraft squadron that had completed its splendid task. However, some attack aircraft, due to poor weather conditions and enemy fire in the fierce battle, although barely managed to fly in front of the mother ship, were still unable to land safely.</p>
<p>Air Combat</p>
<p>At dawn on the 20th, search planes set off to search for enemy aircraft, and surface warships also surged forward. In the afternoon, on the ocean 〇〇 kilometers away, they caught an enemy mobile force consisting of two aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The attack aircraft squadron immediately carried out a twilight attack. At this time, the contact aircraft sent a report stating that the enemy had also launched carrier-based aircraft to attack. The entire fleet immediately completed its air combat deployment. The reporter also plugged his ears, put on a gas mask, put on a steel helmet, stood on the bridge, held his breath, and waited for the enemy aircraft to arrive.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun had already begun to set to the west. At 〇〇:〇〇, the lookout spotted the enemy aircraft and immediately reported:</p>
<p>"Left 〇〇 degrees, altitude 〇 thousand, distance 〇 ten thousand, enemy aircraft formation is flying up."</p>
<p>"Ready, ready..." The battle signal resounded loudly into the clouds. The high-angle gunners, with white headbands and steel helmets, prepared their equipment, waiting for the order to fire. As the enemy aircraft, emerging from the low, heavy dark clouds, approached the fleet's airspace, the Japanese warships continued to carry out combat maneuvers towards the enemy fleet, while opening their gun ports to the sky. The sea was suddenly filled with deafening gunshots. In mid-air, high-angle guns strongly exploded in the enemy aircraft formation. At this time, the first and second enemy aircraft, diving steeply from an altitude of more than three thousand meters towards the Japanese aircraft carrier 〇〇, suddenly trailed black smoke and fell vertically, splashing a wave on the sea far behind the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Panicked by the intense barrage of gunfire from the Japanese side, the enemy aircraft scattered their formation, haphazardly dropped their bombs into the sea, and fled hastily. However, even though this group of enemy aircraft retreated quickly, more than half of them were shot down in an instant. In the sky from which the enemy aircraft retreated, amid the broken clouds, only countless light traces of smoke remained.</p>
<p>Before long, another group of enemy aircraft attacked, but their formation was not tight, and they had no fighting spirit. Several torpedo planes that charged towards the warship 〇〇, upon encountering intense defensive gunfire, did not launch torpedoes and turned around to flee. On the other hand, the Japanese defensive fighters, fighting outnumbered, skillfully counterattacked, catching the enemy aircraft that had not yet flown out of sight of their comrades, and shooting them down one after another. A certain fighter pilot fought three enemies alone, displaying invincible combat skills, and shot down one of them in an instant.</p>
<p>Triumphant Return</p>
<p>Thus, the enemy's attack resulted in failure, not only failing to achieve any battle results, but also suffering losses. Compared to the enemy carrier-based aircraft air raid that the reporter experienced in 〇〇 last year, this air combat showed that the enemy's attack techniques and fighting spirit against warships had greatly declined.</p>
<p>After repelling the enemy aircraft, the Japanese fleet continued to sail as usual, advancing in a strong formation, taking a striking posture, hoping for a night battle soon. On the other hand, the battle results of the twilight attack clarified that the Japanese side had sunk the enemy's standard large aircraft carrier, the Bunga Hill. However, the enemy also seized the opportunity to concentrate their attack on the Japanese oil tankers, causing two of them to catch fire.</p>
<p>Thus, this unprecedented battle between large fleets resulted in a one-sided situation. The Japanese side only lost one aircraft carrier, while the rest were unharmed. However, in the end, they had to retreat. Therefore, the surviving enemy mobile force is still cruising near the Mariana Islands. This situation is enough to show the severity of the current war situation. It is currently urgent to strengthen combat power from all aspects. (Report from a special correspondent on the warship 〇〇) (Translated from the July 4th edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Intensification of the European War <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>German Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted at a rally on July 8th: "The German people are currently in a crisis!" He demanded that every citizen participate in the total war more strictly than before.</p>
<p>"There is still extra strength in the German people's wartime life. For example, there is a big distance between the lives of the so-called air raid victims whose houses are burned down, properties are lost, and family members are injured or killed in air raids, and the lives of those who live in places that are spared from the terror of enemy bombing. Therefore, the German people should take the difficult lives of the people in the bombed areas as the standard of life, and make no spiritual or material demands," said Dr. Goebbels.</p>
<p>In this call, which considers Germany's alarming total war system to be not yet fully implemented, we can get a glimpse of Germany's serious and profound situation today. The enemy's offensive on the southern Italian front, the enemy's landing on the western Normandy Peninsula, and the Soviet army's advance of tens of thousands of troops to the east, all clearly show that the anti-German allied forces have already started their general offensive.</p>
<p>Shortcut to Berlin</p>
<p>Moreover, observing the manner of these attacks, we can discern the enemy's determination to choose the shortest distance to Berlin in order to overthrow Germany in one fell swoop. Germany has also long understood the essence of the enemy's intentions. Therefore, even without Dr. Goebbels' explanation, the German people have already thoroughly realized that this summer is the final stage of the decisive battle. By the time of the osmanthus fragrance in October this year, the European war will have passed its climax. According to the current situation, assuming that the war ends this year, the fate of the European war will be determined by the development of the war in the recent three or four months. "Time is Germany's friend." Although this claim has long dominated German thought, no one is putting this sentence on their lips today. Since the enemy has demanded a final decisive battle, Germany will naturally exhaust all its current strength to rise up and counterattack.</p>
<p>The Race is Approaching the Finish Line</p>
<p>What are the German leaders' views on the current heated battle situation? How do they explain it to the people? The words used by Dr. Goebbels at the end of the German newspaper's Sunday commentary on the 9th are very meaningful. He compared this war to a long-distance race, and the white line of the finish line is already close at hand. The race has reached the final lap's straight track. Dr. Goebbels said:</p>
<p>"No matter what, we cannot change this road, so we can only grit our teeth and try our best to run to the last second. Whoever can endure will belong to victory. Whether it is the enemy or the ally, whichever side can support it longer can determine the victory. Behind our heels, the brutal enemy is chasing after us with a deathly force. Looking at it, even if they are only an inch apart, the first one to cross the finish line will win."</p>
<p>From this method of expression, we can also understand how tense the battle situation has reached. This is not a rhetorical metaphor, but a real feeling. Even from Germany's point of view, the war has now reached a draw. Germany wants to win the championship in the last lap with a single hope. In his speech on January 30th last year, Führer Hitler said: "At the end of this war, we will either die or win." Now, the boundary between life and death is only separated by a layer of paper. If you don't have the strength at the moment, you can't avoid death!</p>
<p>On the other hand, Germany is shouting "Only this battle," making every effort. A German military reporter described the situation on the Western Normandy front, saying: "The current state of battle between the enemy and us is like two wrestlers grappling with each other, everyone is sweating profusely, but they are all gritting their teeth, and no one moves. Energy is gradually consumed, and sometimes both sides take a breath to adjust their rapid breathing. Suddenly, the opponent's hands and feet move like lightning. The enemy can't resist it, and wants to break free from the German steel arm that is holding him. But, Germany moved his foot, and the battle returned to the posture of grappling and not moving.</p>
<p>Regaining the Initiative in Western Europe</p>
<p>However, this kind of mutual wrestling will never be broken up halfway. If one does not throw the other down, then one will fall down by oneself. In short, there will definitely be a win and a loss. Why? Because both sides have not yet used their main force. Dr. Goebbels also said: "The decisive battle will begin soon." The anti-German allied forces are currently on a circle about a thousand kilometers away from Berlin, and are trying to shrink the encirclement of Germany further inward on the northern French, Italian, and eastern fronts. Although Germany has adopted a retreating strategy in the past two years, it is still fighting far away from the border line at the beginning of the war. Although the situation of the war seems to be favorable to the anti-German allied forces, which hold the initiative in the offensive, Germany is the defender of the inner line, sacrificing the eastern and Italian fronts in order to regain the initiative in the offensive in the west.

<h3 id="e41">Grace <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Tei</p>
<p>"Victory is not bestowed, it is won! Individual happiness can only be achieved by taking responsibility for fighting for it yourself!"</p>
<p>Darkness spread its wings, engulfing everything on the earth. Night, a long night, had appeared before us. In a house filled with bitter sorrow and hopelessness, Grace had spent three hot summers. This house, possessing the magic of money, had buried Grace's youth and happiness, exchanging them for a gray life.</p>
<p>It was early summer weather again. The trees were growing very lushly, and the branches were gently swaying in the slight breeze. Leaning on the window railing, Grace was humming a tune in a sorrowful voice. When she sang, "But only occupying your youth and beauty, for her fleeting admiration; fleeting appreciation, who cares about you, spring goes, autumn comes, growing older year by year," her tears poured down like a tide.</p>
<p>Past events were like a clear mirror, each scene deeply engraved on Grace's mind.</p>
<p>It was a night with clear wind and bright moonlight. Lying on an old bed in a small room, a middle-aged woman of nearly forty, with a fairly delicate face, stretched out her thin hand to caress her only beloved daughter, and urged her in an earnest tone, "Grace, you are no longer a child, you should understand everything. Since your father died, your grandmother and I have worked hard to support you, hoping that you could serve society in the future, so we could have someone to rely on. Now my plan can no longer be realized, and your studies can only be abandoned halfway. Although you aspire to study, it is impossible. In the past few days, my spirits have become even more sluggish, and I expect that the day of leaving the world is not far away..." The bitter and long voice made Grace unable to hold back any longer: "Mom, please don't say any more, I believe your illness will definitely get better." "Also... you... elderly... grandmother... you must... be filial... to her... after my death... be sure to... advise her... not to be too sad..." The tears on her gray face and Grace's tears merged into one, and it was no longer possible to distinguish whose they were.</p>
<p>On a night of wind and rain, Grace's mother finally abandoned her orphaned mother and left the world. Time passed like flowing water. Since her mother's death, Grace's financial difficulties grew worse day by day. The whip of life was driving Grace. Seeing her kind, white-haired grandmother living on rice soup every day, how could Grace bear it? So she had to start struggling, but in this cold and treacherous society, a weak woman was no longer allowed to survive. She was ridiculed and despised everywhere she went, especially by the snobbish newcomers. She did not receive pity, sympathy, or help. She cried, but even if she cried blood, no one came to comfort her. She hated this heartless world, but what was the use?</p>
<p>Finally, in one spring, for the sake of life, for the sake of economic oppression, with no way to call for help, she succumbed and became a concubine in the home of an ignorant, despicable, and vulgar merchant. Although she was unwilling in every possible way, when she looked back at her elderly and sick grandmother, she endured with tears in her eyes. Spiritual torment made her very painful. In her boredom, only books were her comforters. At this time, Grace's heart had already been as cold as death. She had no other hope, only to be able to watch her grandmother safely spend these remaining years, and then destroy her own life. She waited, a year passed! Expectation also came..., grandmother watching her beloved granddaughter being sold to a vulgar peddler, how could she bear it, so worry accumulated into disease, and she also went the way of Grace's mother. At this time, Grace no longer wanted to live. When the coffin of her grandmother was about to be closed, she also wanted to jump in and go with her grandmother, but this was impossible. The people around her quickly pulled her back. Grace was even more sad. Was it so difficult to die?</p>
<p>It was already five in the morning. The funeral home was even more silent and desolate. The grass in the wild was rustling in the wind. Grace was crying in a hoarse voice. Her tears were dry. She could only hear the sound of other people sleeping and the sad chanting of several old women. Grace had been awake for six nights, but even if she lay down, she didn't want to sleep. The more she thought, the more sad she became. Was my fate really so bitter? She thought like this. After a while, the sky was already slightly bright. She dragged her tired body and paced slowly in the courtyard. Suddenly, it seemed as if someone was standing behind her. Grace felt terrified. Could it be a ghost? She mustered up her courage and looked back. Grace's face turned red. It turned out to be a young man, so handsome. They nodded to each other. In this cold air, he opened his mouth: "Miss, what is your name?" "My surname is Zhang." Grace replied, her heart so disturbed that she no longer had the courage to ask him, "Oh, Miss Zhang, the deceased is your mother, right? Such sadness, but the dead cannot be brought back to life. You must take care of your body. The old gentleman in the suit must be your father. Like me, my father died early, wasn't I as sad as you? But we are still young, we should work hard in our own positions, so that the light under the nine springs can be at peace." He comforted Grace in an earnest manner. In this situation, Grace was extremely embarrassed. She wanted to let her suffering be known to others, so that she could vent the love in her heart. So she mustered up all her courage and told him directly. She was worried in her heart. He will definitely look at me with contempt, right? Contrary to expectations, his tone was so gentle, "No, this is not your sin, you are still young, you need freedom, you need happiness." Grace almost wanted to go crazy. For years, she had never heard anyone sympathize with her. Today, like a prisoner getting a lighter sentence, a joy she had never had in years, she showed it to a strange young man.</p>
<p>A girl's youth is easy to revive. Grace's heart, which had been cold for a long time, began to be active. Since she met Cun that day, the seeds of emotion had already been hidden in the hearts of both of them. She knew that Cun was an honest youth, only twenty-five years old, four years older than Grace, and working in a bank. In addition to his mother, there was also a widowed sister at home. Since then, Cun often invited her to walk in the fields or at the foot of the mountains. They had left their footprints in various secluded places. Grace was intoxicated. She didn't know that there was still hatred, annoyance, and sorrow in the world. Every day, they were only immersed in the sea of love. Cun and Grace could not leave each other. They were planning how to get out of this environment, and then how to prepare for marriage, and how beautiful and joyful their life would be after marriage. Everything was thought over by them.</p>
<p>The clear blue sky suddenly became troubled. Things that are too good are often easily ruined. The fact that Grace and Cun were in love was known to the merchant. So Grace lost her freedom and was placed under house arrest, unable to enter and exit freely. She was simply like a golden silk bird, living in luxury, waiting for her master to be happy before taking her out to stroll around....</p>
<p>The taste of first love was sweet enough. Although Grace's body was bound, her heart had already flown into Cun's arms. She thought about Cun every day, hoping that there would be an opportunity to reunite with the joy of the past.</p>
<p>The troubled spring came again. Grace hated spring the most. It could make people recall the past scenes. She felt that she had been a tool for three years, used to satisfy his desires to the fullest, but had never received a single ounce of true love. She was in so much pain that she thought of Cun. They had loved each other purely and frankly for a short period of time, but were separated again. How could she not be heartbroken? When she thought of Cun late at night, her tears would soak the entire pillow. She would bless and pray for Cun, hoping that he would be healthy and safe. Her love for him was eternal. She loved him in the past, she loves him now, and she will still love him in the future, and she will never forget him until she dies.</p>
<p>After many twists and turns, Grace had guessed what life was all about. It was simply like a spring dream. She also understood the true meaning of life, that she must work hard to be worthy of this lifetime. So after suffering many hardships and going through many difficulties, she began to realize: The most precious thing in the world is only freedom! Happiness is up to you to fight for! So she made up her mind to give up all material enjoyment and was unwilling to live a life of dependency and parasitism forever! Especially this life without love, without true feelings, only infinite humiliation. Finally, welcoming the arrival of the fourth hot summer, Grace resolutely left this home shrouded in the magic of money! Buried all her memories, left Shanghai, and went to a bright future with Cun, to build the beautiful and ideal family they yearned for!</p>
<h3 id="e42">Words of the Rose <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Yaoqing</p>
<p>I love roses, not because they can symbolize love, but because besides their delicate and beautiful flowers, they also have thorns. That's why I often read Lu Xun's "Thornless Rose."</p>
<p>The rose, scientifically known as Kosaaciclaris, has many different names in China. For example, in the "Classic of Herbal Medicine," it is written as Qiangmi. Li Shizhen said, "The grass is soft and pliant, growing by walls and clinging to surfaces, hence the name." Another name is Ci Hong, or Shan Ji. The "Classic of Herbal Medicine" says, "Its stems have many thorns that cut people, and oxen love to eat it, hence the various names. It is also called 'Mai Xiao' (Buying a Smile), as seen in 'Jia's Forest of Sayings,' because Emperor Wu of Han gave a hundred catties of gold as 'Mai Xiao Qian' (Buying a Smile Money) when he and Consort Bixia enjoyed the rose flowers together."</p>
<p>As a child, after reading Zhou Dunyi's "Ode to the Lotus," I longed to be a recluse for a time. At the same time, influenced by the advocacy of "Ode to the Jade," I also had a good feeling for flowers. However, I found the peony too vulgar and never liked it. As for the rose, it was a later development. As I became more worldly and my understanding of things deepened, I became disgusted with all those delicate, weak, and helpless things that had no backbone and were at the mercy of others, as docile as lambs, only pleasing to lovers. By extension, plants, trees, insects, and fish of the same type were all banished from my affections. That is why I love bees and not butterflies, and my love for the thorns of the rose is based on the same principle.</p>
<p>In this world, there are naturally many people who love the rose, but most of them love its delicate and colorful flowers. I am afraid that few love its thorns.</p>
<p>Pei Du of the Tang Dynasty planted flowers and built pavilions in his garden. When Jia Dao failed the imperial examination, in his resentment, he wrote a poem about the Xinghua Garden, saying, "He emptied a thousand homes to make a pond, did not plant peaches and plums but roses; when the rose flowers fall and the autumn wind rises, the courtyard is full of thorns, then the prince knows." Failing the examination, this is a bit pointless. But what we want to say is the matter of the autumn wind rising, the flowers falling, and the courtyard being full of thorns. In the eyes of people like Jia Dao, this is a blight on the landscape, and there are no fruits, so they love peaches and plums but not roses. Little do they know that this is precisely in line with the "beauty of defects used in the kitchen for self-sufficiency." Without this courtyard full of thorns, how can one appreciate the goodness of the flowers when they bloom? At the same time, the flowering and the benefits of the roses give an unexpected blow to those who call themselves flower lovers – in reality, girls and young masters who destroy flowers. If they want to pick them and are not careful, their fingers will be pricked and bleed, which is a very satisfying thing. There is a line in Chu Guangyi's "Ode to the Rose" in the Tang Dynasty that says, "The daughters of the Qin family love the fragrant blossoms, they gather them playfully in pairs; the red buds are about to be reached, but the green thorns have already caught their clothes." What I love to recite is precisely this point of the green thorns catching the clothes.</p>
<p>As for making rose water from roses and sprinkling it on clothes, the scriptures do not cease. (See the "History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of the Ancient City Ten Kingdoms"). Although I love roses, I don't necessarily love rose dew, because it has lost its thorns. Moreover, as long as a person doesn't emit an offensive odor, why should they be made fragrant and offensively charming to please and attract love?</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am reminded of Liu Zongyuan's flattery. "Miscellaneous Sayings of Cloud Immortals" says, "Liu Zongyuan received the poem sent by Han Yu and first washed his hands with rose water before reading it." This cannot help but make people laugh and make me want to complain and shout injustice for the rose I love.</p>

<h3 id="e43">A Scene <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yuyan</p>
<p>"Sister! Registered letter! You need to sign it. It's from your school." Yiwen had just returned from buying groceries for her mother, her basket still hanging on her arm, when her younger sister took a letter and ran up from downstairs.</p>
<p>"It's early this year. In previous years, the letter of appointment was always sent close to the start of school... It's probably asking you to teach tutoring students again." Her mother was lighting the coal stove at the door of the room, fanning herself while muttering.</p>
<p>Yiwen is a girl who is only twenty-two years old this year, but don't underestimate her. She has already taken on the burden of supporting a family of three. Although she is a primary school teacher who is despised by others, she earns a certain amount of money each month by working part-time elsewhere, piecing it together, barely enough to support the family's frugal life.</p>
<p>"Now, men and women are the same, both can support a family. Like our A Yi, hasn't she supported us?" Her mother often bragged about her among the neighbors. She is indeed a new woman of the times.</p>
<p>Yiwen signed the letter and sent the slip downstairs, then eagerly tore open the envelope and began to read. She also thought that the principal must be inviting her to be a teacher in the second term of the summer practice school. She remembered that she had been invited last year as well, teaching only three hours a day, with few students, and the salary was even higher than her original one. Last year, she taught in the summer and even made a lined robe for her mother!</p>
<p>"Five cents, five cents, one cent, one yuan, one cent, sister, why do you need so many stamps...? Oh, it's glued too tightly, sister, can you help me tear them off?" Her younger sister liked stamps the most, and all the stamps on Yiwen's letters were torn off by her.</p>
<p>Her younger sister was shouting loudly beside her, but Yiwen didn't respond to her as usual. Her heart was pounding, her head was spinning, and in front of her eyes, she immediately saw an old and a young person kneeling before her with crying faces.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm not wrong, you can't blame me." Yiwen couldn't help but shout loudly, and immediately collapsed into the armchair beside her. The mother, who was fanning the coal stove, was startled by her daughter's sudden shout. When she turned her head, she saw Yiwen lying in the armchair with her eyes closed, her face pale, and her mouth full of pleading words.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! What's wrong? She must have been hit by something ominous when she went to buy groceries. What can I do? Amitabha, Amitabha, Amitabha..." Her mother was so anxious that she didn't know what to do, and chanted Amitabha repeatedly, trying to ask the Buddha for blessing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wife of Teacher Li in the front building was open-minded and said to Yiwen's mother, "It's useless to chant the Buddha. Tell her to put a cold, wet towel on Yiwen's forehead." She herself went to get a packet of Rendan pills for her to take. Only then did she gradually wake up. Yiwen opened her eyes and saw her mother standing in front of the bed. She couldn't help but shed tears and said, "Mom! I'm not wrong, you can't blame me."</p>
<p>"Good girl! Rest well. You're going to scare your mom to death."</p>
<p>"Sister Gu's mother, Yiwen's illness is not ordinary. It looks like she has suffered a special fright. You should comfort her." Mrs. Li persuaded from the side.</p>
<p>"What fright? She just went to the grocery market after she got up..."</p>
<p>"Mom! The school doesn't want sister to teach anymore." The younger sister was still clever. She went to look at the letter from the school to her sister and whispered it in Jiao's ear.</p>
<p>Yiwen, who was usually not good at getting sick, was lying in bed and couldn't stand it anymore. Moreover, she was still worried about the problem of eating in the second half of the year, so she insisted on going out on the fourth day. Her mother couldn't stop her anymore.</p>
<p>If she didn't go out, she wouldn't know the truth, and she could still get by in an Ah Q-like way. Once she went out and knew the details, it really made her angry to death. It turned out that a Mr. Huo Ting had introduced three teachers, and the principal had no place to arrange them, so he dismissed Yiwen and the other three who had no backing.</p>
<p>"How is it? Did you meet the principal?" Yiwen dragged her heavy steps and stepped into the room. Her mother asked her like this.</p>
<p>"No, 'Don't be an official if you have no one in the court.'"</p>
<p>"You can talk to the principal. You have taught in his school for more than two years and haven't done anything wrong. Why don't you want you all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>"There are already people."</p>
<p>"You don't go, I'll beg him: You should also think for others. You can't just dismiss people for no reason... Even if you have no place to arrange them in your school, you have to introduce them to others, or they will starve to death..."</p>
<p>"You go! You can go to see the principal in this outfit." When her daughter said this, she looked at herself, and then she remembered a sentence that she often said: "Even a beggar's clothes are better than mine."</p>
<p>The room was silent, with only Yiwen's sobs and her mother's sighs.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Welcome the Sports Friends Team <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Haijie Danle</p>
<p>This spring, the Beixing Team's southern expedition failed to adapt to the circumstances and couldn't fully display its strengths due to its conservative tactics. It was trapped in a bitter struggle by the cunning Shanghai teams that adopted "man-to-man" tactics and suffered repeated defeats. However, its lightning-fast attacks, its spirit of fighting to the end, and its good sportsmanship still linger in our minds. Heroes are not judged by success or failure. Now, the North China Sports Friends Basketball Team has followed Beixing to the south. It has many national team players and a strong military presence. It has already shown its skills in Nanjing, Wujin, Wuxing, and other places. Wherever its flags point, those who stand in its way will be defeated. Judging by its strength, it should be above Beixing. The team consists of old partners from sports schools, and three generals are also members of the Beixing team that came to Shanghai before. The athletes from the north are known for their hard work. After returning with broken feathers, they are wholeheartedly committed to making amends. Three days apart, they should be looked at with new eyes. This time, they have come to Shanghai again with the determination to win and strive to avenge their previous defeat. To avoid repeating the mistakes, they must have studied the tactics in depth. Therefore, it is expected that the team will be able to refresh our senses.</p>
<p>Currently, the team of eight has arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday afternoon. Zhang Yixiang, the leader of the Shanghai basketball champion Hualian Team, specially sent the team's famous players Fan Qinggong and Wu Chengzhu to the station to welcome them. Because Fan and the team's Cui Wenzhong, Chang Ying, and Guo Yongen are all graduates of the 5th class of the Sports College, they were especially happy to meet old acquaintances in a foreign land. They were immediately placed in the YMCA on Sichuan Road, and Zhang hosted a banquet for them at noon and in the evening.</p>
<p>Introducing Famous Players</p>
<p>Except for Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong, who came to the south with Beixing in April and have already been introduced by various newspapers, the remaining five players, Cui Wenzhong, Zhao Shoucheng, Wang Shengzhi, Wang Yuming, and Dou Wenying, are now introduced below:</p>
<p>Zhao Shoucheng Thirty years old, graduated from Beijing Sports College, captain of the Sports Friends Team. In 1935, he and Wang Hongbin and others attended the first Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Games. In addition to being good at basketball, he is also proficient in all track and field events.</p>
<p>Cui Wenzhong Twenty-seven years old, graduated from Beijing Sports College. Currently working at the Propaganda Office in Baoding, he attended the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Games and the Manchukuo Games two years ago. In 1939, he represented his alma mater and won the World Basketball Championship. He is a famous defender in North China.</p>
<p>Wang Shengzhi Twenty years old, a junior at Beijing Normal University. He has represented Beijing in the North China Games many times. He was also a member of the Beixing Team. Last time Beixing moved south, he originally intended to come with the team, but he was not allowed to take leave by the school.</p>
<p>Dou Wenying Nineteen years old, a talented student at China University in Beijing. He has represented Beijing in the North China Games for middle school basketball many times. He is a rising star in the northern sports world.</p>
<p>Wang Yuming Twenty-two years old, a classmate of Dou Wenying, a star player on the China University football team, especially good at basketball. His basketball style is quite like that of Ah Kong.</p>
<p>Plentiful Strength</p>
<p>The team went to the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday to practice their skills. The reporter inquired about their strength and briefly introduces it:</p>
<p>In terms of tactics, they have indeed advanced to using both zone defense and man-to-man defense, and with their sufficient strength, they are doing everything in an orderly manner. They have won two consecutive games in Nanjing, and Wujin and Wuxian have also been victorious. It is said that they all used man-to-man defense, which is very pure. In terms of individual players, Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong were all familiar with the Beixing performance. He is responsible for the forward position, both wise and brave, and can take advantage of opportunities to shoot into the empty spots. He is sure to shoot and command the three armies, worthy of a general. The rear guard Cui Wenzhong is a quasi-rear guard, and long shots are his specialty. These two players will surely have a wonderful performance this time. The rest, such as Wang Shengzhi, Wang Yuming, and Dou Wenying, are all strong and have a pure level of basketball skills, and it is especially valuable that they can pay attention to team cooperation.</p>
<p>The team will start its Shanghai campaign tonight, but the number of games is still questionable. In addition to the number of games stipulated by the authorities, it is rumored that the two new emerging teams, Nanhua and Beihua, intend to challenge them. Therefore, regarding this point, please pay attention to the sports news network.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Question of Restricting Jumping When Serving in Volleyball <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— (Bixian)</p>
<p>After the reporter published his opinion on the question of restricting jumping when serving in volleyball in the previous issue, he received many letters from various people. The opinions expressed are excerpted from the following four original drafts:</p>
<p>Zhou Jiaqi</p>
<p>The rule that jumping is not allowed when serving in volleyball is the same as in tennis. The text of the rule is not very obvious, which is indeed the case. But if you carefully distinguish the meaning of the text, you can understand that there is a restriction against jumping. (This rule was questioned before the war.) "When serving (not before serving), the player's feet should be behind the end line," meaning that when the ball is hit, the feet must be on the ground, and the jumping action is used before hitting the ball (jumping after hitting the ball is a meaningless action; both feet off the ground is called jumping). Since it is necessary to stand still, the meaning of not being able to jump is clear.</p>
<p>Yu Juchen</p>
<p>I think it should be based on the seven words "should be behind the end line" in "when serving, the player's feet should be behind the end line," which means that any one foot cannot cross the end line.</p>
<p>Wang Shiqin</p>
<p>Sports rules are like national laws. Explicit provisions do not allow for borrowing, let alone ambiguous words, and should not be misinterpreted. If this is clear, a conclusion can be drawn on the question of not allowing jumping when serving in volleyball. Since the rules do not stipulate that jumping is not allowed when serving, what is the basis for saying that this is a foul? Furthermore, if Tan Yongzhan must stand two or three steps behind the end line when serving, and hit the ball while moving, then why not point out that he is walking (Walking), but only pay attention to the one foot leaving the ground (it is actually impossible to hit the ball with both feet off the ground), which is used to slightly assist the arm strength, as jumping (Jumping). Moreover, American rules also limit jumping, so the word (Jumpeng) is probably the creation of Shanghai referees.</p>
<p>Tang Qimin</p>
<p>Volleyball referees restrict jumping serves. I once discussed this with my old friend Zhang Le. According to him: "The former Far East rules originally restricted jumping, but they were later changed, so it is necessary to pay attention to it. Before the ball is released, when any one foot is in the air, it cannot step into the end line." From this, it can be seen that the recent referees' practice of regarding any slight raising of one foot when serving as jumping is an overcorrection.</p>
<p>According to the above four, there are referees, players, or seniors, who have all given their advice. To sum up, it seems that there is a need to reform the current situation of strict restrictions. The reporter still hopes that the Volleyball Referees Association will give me a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Recent Situation of the Volleyball League <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The volleyball league has been settled after the men's and women's battles on Monday (the 24th). After losing to the Russian Overseas Chinese A team in Group A, the championship has almost become Qingzhong's. There is no doubt about it. After the women's Green team defeated Zhi Qian, they are currently in the most advantageous position and have high hopes. The recent situation is briefly described below.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The General Trend of Group A Has Been Determined, and Yuehua Is Sure to Win the Championship <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yuehua has won three games in three, and the hidden dangers have been eliminated. There is still one game left against. Therefore, it seems that they have already won the championship, which is gratifying and congratulations. This should be attributed to the efforts of the players and Xiao Xigeng's effective leadership. After the Russian Overseas Chinese A team lost to Yuehua, judging by its strength, it is indeed very strong. If there are two more battles, it should be able to maintain its victory and win the runner-up. There is no problem. For the third place, if Huaying can strive to rejuvenate and adjust the two or three lineups, there is hope. If they still do not practice hard and casually take the field, they will give it to the Russian Overseas Chinese B team, which won a lucky victory over the White team. The White team had an unfavorable first battle. They could win but did not win, and they lost to the Russian Overseas Chinese B team. They may not be able to escape the last place.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Zhi Qian Has No Spirit in the Women's Group, and the Green Team Has a Bright Future <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The women's group was originally a three-legged situation between the Green team, Three Provinces, and Zhi Qian. Now that the Green team has defeated Zhi Qian, they should be temporarily ranked in the most advantageous position. The difficult point later is the battle with Three Provinces. With the brains of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin and their effective deployment, the future is indeed bright. However, Three Provinces still maintains an undefeated record. However, they have not yet faced Zhi Qian and the Green team. It seems that they have to overcome two difficulties, which is slightly less hopeful than the Green team. The only hope for Zhi Qian is to defeat Three Provinces, otherwise they will be relegated to third place. In short, they are afraid that it will be difficult to win the championship, and it is all in vain for Wu Yi's efforts. The fourth and fifth places will be contested by Xiqing, Honghua, and Yanguan. Judging by strength, Xihong is slightly better, but the spirit of the group is better, so Huayan may be able to rely on this to win and get rid of the yellow one. (Bixian)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Two Basketball Players of Huaying Married at the Same Time <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Who in the basketball circle doesn't know that Gao Fanshen (Fan Sheng) of the Huaying Basketball Team is good at using the rebound shot under the basket, with nine out of ten shots hitting, hence the fame. Who doesn't know that Che Yaoan, a new Qingdao basketball representative player, has recently joined the Huaying team. He is agile. He has recently overwhelmed the Star Team in the opening game of the Shaoxing Cup. These two players have contributed the most. The reason is nothing else, they are both happy events.</p>
<p>The wedding of Gao and Che was held on the same day (the 26th) on the second floor of the Huaguo Restaurant. Gao Fanshen's partner was Miss Wu Qiaohua (an employee of Huaying Company), and Che's partner was actress Wang Mengna. This news was extremely secret beforehand. However, there were still many people who knew and came to congratulate them. In terms of the basketball circle, there were Zhang Juefei, Li Baozhong, Li Zhenzhong, Xie Yiqin, and others. In the film industry, directors, actresses, actors, and drama circles, there were Chen Lu and others, totaling fifty people. The stars and movie stars reflected each other, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. The writer also participated in the joyful meeting, so he briefly described one or two tidbits.</p>
<p>Newcomer's Report, Lan Gen's Joke</p>
<p>During the program, it was the new turn. When Gao Fanshen stood up and was giving a serious report, the listeners were moved. Comedian Han Lan Gen secretly slipped out early, rushed in hastily, and shouted solemnly, "Gao Fanshen, there is a pregnant woman downstairs who is cursing all the way to see you." As soon as he finished speaking, the whole hall burst into laughter, and the skinny monkey did not shed his comedic nature.</p>
<p>Pretending and Acting, What a Nao Tou</p>
<p>During the toasts from the congratulatory guests, Gao Fanshen pretended to be drunk, wanting to deny drinking, not a rebound shot. He held his head in both hands, and the wine spilled all over the ground, the posture was extremely beautiful, what a shot. Che Yaoan pretended to have just had a tooth extracted, put his fingers in his mouth, his eyebrows were furrowed and his face was bitter, and he refused to drink a drop, another good joke.

<h3 id="e51">Rare News <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>A newly emerging women's basketball team in Shanghai, all of whom are newcomers with no reputation, has achieved very good results and has emerged unusually. Encouraging the progress of latecomers is indeed good news.</p>
<p>Zhu Shifang and Cheng Hongsheng said that they seemed to have eaten "red" date soup after the Zhi Qian women's volleyball team defeated the Xiqing Red team. When fighting the Green team, everyone said that they could drink "green" bean soup today, but unfortunately, the result was a crushing defeat. They went again, the green bean soup was expensive, and they changed to sour plum soup to comfort themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Simple Fitness Training Method (II) (I) <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Tang Mei, Translated by Yide</p>
<p>This exercise, especially the rotation of the body to the right, is called the liver squeeze exercise by scholars. This is the simplest, most effective, and cheapest treatment for liver numbness. Those who suffer from biliary headaches may wish to try it.</p>
<p>People should not regard exercise as inappropriate just because they do not like it. It must be known that appropriate exercise can be used for rest even when people feel tired, but do not exercise too much to the point of exhaustion. Those who are tired rarely feel tired all over. If so, then the so-called tiredness is mostly just a group of muscles that are weak due to overwork. You might as well use other groups of muscles to rest, such as running for a while when you are tired of walking, and moving your body when you are mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>This kind of rest method of changing work can be seen in the workers of the factory. The workers of the Zhijiage Leather Iron Factory in Chicago mostly play ball games after lunch to rest. They exercise very hard, which is also a method of changing work.</p>
<p>Liver Squeeze Exercise Rotation; to the left; to the right; (five times each).</p>
<p>Note Special exercises, or personal exercises, should be more than ten times each to the left and right.</p>
