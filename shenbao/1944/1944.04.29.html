<h3>調整統制機構之商榷</h3>
<p>最近調整統制機構之說，甚囂塵上，吾人有鑒於過去一年中統制機構之系統紛紜，事權不一，以致主其事者，則焦頭爛額，疲於應付：被統制者，則備嘗痛苦，怨讓繁與，亦深覺似此局面，殊有變通調整之必要。物資統制一事，雖非向受自由薰染之吾國人士所能深刻了解，但大勢所趨，世界各國，無論其向來主義如何，政策如何，巳莫不羣歸於統制之一途。吾國向來生產落後，爲調節非常時期之供求起見，實行統制，事非得巳，故政策之不能轉移，無待煩言。所應檢討者，即統制機構如何調整？統制方法如何改善？然後方能有利於戰事，有利於民，無害於戰事，無害於民，庶統制政策可得人民之贊助擁護，以底於成。</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會之成立巳逾一年，當其成立之初，當局曾以「商業　體自治統制」相揭　。願一攷其內容，則理監事悉由政府指派，名實逈不相侔。其唯一之原因，爲下層機構尙未組織完成，選舉無從舉辦，理監事無由產生。而實行統制，則有不能須臾或緩之勢，不得不以此種權宜辦法，暫作臨時過渡。吾人於此，亦深諒當時環境事實，雅不欲以嚴格之法塲立塲相苛繩。今者事隔一年，各業同業公會，各業聯合會均巳先後依法組織成立，尤宜限期改選，以符商業自治精神。爲各業公會計，亦應認清統制與其本業之關係，一秉至公，愼選確能代表其本業之人選。而當選者尤應不辭勞怨，不事推腇，以盡其對於本業應負之責任，並爲社會人民謀福利，此爲組織中最上層之理監會而言·至理監會以下之組織，在過去商統會各部門中，亦不無應加改善者。如商統會有物資處之組設，顧名思義，凡屬統制之物資，自應悉　該處管理。而事實則米糧統制，有米糧統制會，棉花統制，有棉花統制會，皆直隸行政院，與商統會分庭抗禮，更非商統會以下之物資處所得過問。假使此種分類各別統制辦法，政府認爲適當，則何以米糧棉花以外之統制物品，又仍歸商統會處理？又何以同屬民食之油糧不併入米統會？以棉花爲原料之棉製品雖經商統會呈准行政院移轉棉花統會，而至今尙未見棉統會予以接收？惝恍迷離，莫裏一是，殊今局外人如　五里霧中。其支離破碎之尤者，爲商統會在名義上雖屬全國性，而事實則武漢有武漢分會，廣東有廣東分會，華北有華北分會，辦法岐異，各不相謀。同時，華中日本貿易公司組織龐大，並時有收購運銷大宗辦理統制物品情形，與商統會相似。更就統制物品言，如煤炭，如　菸，　類等，其配給定價，非商統會所得過問。以如此四分五裂之情形，系統紊亂之局面，欲求發揮功能，貫澈國策，　戞戞其亂矣！</p>
<p>値茲各方一致主張調整機構之際，吾人願以誠意，貢獻下列各點：</p>
<p>應首先確定調整後之統制機構，究爲一元化？抑爲分類個別統制？如屬一元化，則各地分會應使隸屬總會，而米統會，棉統會亦應便例爲商統會專業部門之一。又其他足以影響　礙統制機構之一元化者，無論中外，均應在取消之列。反之，如探用分離個別辦法，則商統會之存在，無異疊牀架屋，根本應予取消，方爲合理。</p>
<p>應將統制物品種類，重加嚴密檢討，其於民生無關重要，而過去統制又不能澈底者，與共類統制而實非統制，徒予不肖商人以營私舞弊之機會，增加人民之痛苦者，毌寗毅然取消統制，使之自由流通，卽間接亦可以促成物價平抑之效。</p>
<p>確定統制物資與非統制物資以後，聯帶應重行檢討許可制度。所有非統制物品，並應廢除許可辦法，以促進物資之圓滑交流。</p>
<p>實行統制之根本問題，爲促進生產。蓋生產不足，則統制機構無論如何調整？如何健全？統制辦法無論如何完善？亦必有時而窮。欲求統制政策之順利推行，增加生產，實屬不容漠視。關於此點，似應由政府機關，社會團體，各以全力，分別推動，並期於最短期內，獲有成效。</p>

<h3>日機隊活躍印境　阻止敵空中補給　兩日擊落敵機三十餘架</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十八日發表：日印同盟軍對伊姆法爾盆地之包圍攻擊，近日進展頗爲順利，英印第四軍團於盆地內這過攻擊，其命運巳迫旦夕。爰敵軍因後方連絡路綫被日印軍截斷，故乃動員會從事補給加　地區敵空輸部隊之運輸機及東印之空軍總力，協力伊姆法爾防衛戰，自中空補給彈藥食糧，目前伊姆法爾之命運，乃以空中補給如何爲轉移。緬甸方面日軍機隊連日則於伊姆法爾戰綫上空活躍，協力地上部隊作戰，阻止敵空中補給，計二十五·六兩日共擊落敵運輸機十二架（內四架未證實），戰鬥機十一架，炸毀陸上停放之運輸機八架，日戰鬥機隊，曾於二十五日進攻敵空轍部隊之根據地西爾其亞及海關，迭於途中發見由戰鬥機獲送之敵運輸機羣，逐對之加以攻擊，經激　後，擊落敵BC3型運輸機十一架及噴火式戰鬥機三架，共計十四架。二十六日正午，進攻伊姆法爾盆地時，復發現滿載援軍及補給資材，將于伊姆法爾南·北兩機塲着陸之BC3型運輸機羣，當即實行强襲，重創其八架，擊落哨戒中之敵噴火式戰鬥機七架及旋風式戰鬥機一架。是日另一隊，于伊姆法爾東北方三十公里附近上空，發現由戰鬥機二架護送有渝軍標誌之四發大型軍輸機一架，遂即加以逍擊，經一時半後，卒於富貢地區佛特亥爾茲上空將之擊落，予敵空軍以重大打擊，日機損失僅二十五日有一架未飛返，二十六日則有一架自炸。</p>
<h3>日印軍佔領　丹克諾巴爾</h3>
<p>印度前綫二十八日中央社電　日印軍進攻伊姆法爾盆地東南要塞巴列爾，日趨激烈，巴列爾要塞最後之薩巴姆·謝那姆陣地已瀕危，日印軍於二十一日拂　完全佔領丹克諾巴爾，一舉突入薩巴姆·謝那姆陣地第一綫陣地，即將其佔領，雙方於二百米之近距離陣地展開激戰。二十五日軍於全綫施行夜襲，突入敵第二綫陣地，兩軍以白刃交戰逐次進迫薩巴姆·謝那姆之敵軍之主要陣地，並連續加以猛攻。又西頓吉奧附近之日軍，亦巳進抵丹克諾巴爾地區，施行夜襲，佔領法爾布恩，由側背威脅薩巴姆要塞。敵軍誇稱巴列爾陣地可堅守二個月，但日軍於本月十日開始攻擊以來，一再加以猛攻，預料不久即將突入，據守該方面之敵第二十師及第二十三師之一部約三干人，多爲英美籍軍隊，經日印軍猛攻，巳蒙鉅創，　二十二日迄二十四日之三日內，敵兵陣亡三百餘名。</p>
<p>仰光二十八日中央社電　在加拉頓方面作戰中之日軍諸部隊，巳佔領敵反攻據點巴列特瓦，並急迫敵軍，一部隊巳迫近加拉頓（巴列特瓦北方三十公里）西南若干公里之地點。其他部隊逐次奪取加拉頓河左岸敵軍陣地。</p>
<h3>擊特魯克敵機　被擊落兩架</h3>

<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電據康白拉電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十四日發表：反軸心軍於海空軍掩議下，業於二十二日在新幾內亞北方海岸之阿伊答伯，荷蘭地亞登陸，曾受相當損失。</p>
<h3>馬紹爾島東海面　日潛艇襲擊敵艦　大型空母一艘命中魚雷</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日本大本營四月二十八日下午二時發表：日潛艇於四月十六日在馬紹爾羣島東方海面，襲擊敵大型航空母艦，使共一艘命中魚雷兩發。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電日潛艇爲防止太平洋海面頑敵之蠢動，始終與各地駐軍及航空部隊保持緊密連絡，繼續搜索敵艦，本月十六日日潛艇在馬紹爾羣島東方海面，發現敵大型空母兩艘，當即開始以魚雷攻擊，其中一艘命中兩發，使其受重創，或巳沉沒，此次潛艇使敵空母受重創後，預料今後由夏威夷方面駛向馬紹爾羣島之美增援船舶，必將嚴加哨戒也。在渺茫之海面，以潛望鏡一架担任投索工作，實爲困難，日潛艇此次克服困難，以電波兵器及哨戒機構成嚴密管戒網，並於白盡中發射魚雷，此種勇敢精神，實足驚震天下。</p>
<h3>菲特使設宴　招待日首相</h3>

<h3>日本戰力雄厚　確信必能獲勝　松島部長在京演講</h3>
<p>中央社京訊　日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於二十七日下午七時半，於靑年館以「大東亞決戰之秋」爲題，發表演講，對目前戰局分析極詳，對日本必獲其戰爭最後勝利之態勢，尤有確當之指示，原詞如下：</p>
<p>決定日德命運</p>
<p>目前世界及東亞之戰局，均有顯著變化，東部太平洋上英美正急速展開進擊作戰，而一面在西歐對德結成第二戰綫。前者足以決定日本之命運，後者則爲決定盟邦機國之命運，巳毋待　言。英美爲使战争迅速　结，愈形焦慮，企圓改變其國内情势，以及國民戰意之持續，凡此均爲不易奏效者，而彼等惟一希望，則爲加強生產力，冀能有助於戰路上之成功。蓋英美自强調大規模攻勢作戰以來，表面上似甚積極作戰，然因日軍防衛堅固，且勇猛作戰，勝敗之局，早經奠定。四月十四日，美聯合艦隊司令長官屬下金格作戰部長，曾於下院委員會聲稱，「爲遂行對日作戰，今後六個月內將遭受巨大犧牲，美國人民對此非覺悟不可」又其國內之廣播謂，「自開戰以來，美海軍艦隊及資材最初甚爲充實，日本海軍經數月觀察，對此亦甚爲明瞭。」又本月二十三日，美海軍畏官廣播謂：「美海軍之戰備及作戰企圖，可從海軍將兵作戰精神觀察得之。」蓋美海軍於從事大東亞戰爭時，曾計劃擴充兵力，企圖於本年底完成兩洋艦隊。茲錄一九四一年（昭和十六年）美國現有之海軍戰鬥力（包括製造中）如次：</p>
<p>（已完成）　（製造中）</p>
<p>戰艦　一七　一五</p>
<p>航空母艦　七　　一一</p>
<p>巡洋艦　三七　　五四</p>
<p>驅逐艦　一七一　一九三</p>
<p>潛水艇　一一三　七三</p>
<p>然而自夏威夷海戰以來，敵艦艇遭受莫大損失，全國一百二十家以上之造船所，均全體總動員積極趕造，以期彌補當時之損失。據諾克斯於三月間之聲明，目前行將完竣之艦艇，計戰艦二十一艘，戰船六艘等，合計的五十艘以上。並爲充實其他船舶，目下更將積極製造。自一月以來，尼米資艦隊由馬　爾方面突入日本內南洋諸島，企圖進攻菲律賓，另一方面欲分裂日本本土，及南方重要之資源地帶，因此與日海軍主力不對展開猛烈決戰。至是戰爭進行遂　神速狀態，敵方深感焦慮。此實由於日軍巧妙之戰略，掌握制空權，使敵方頻蒙重大損害，尤以人口方面之損失更形慘重，此巳爲鐵一般之事實。然敵方慣使欺瞞宣傳，以蒙敵國民，對自身之損害，素不眞實發表。如最近日軍當局發表敵方戰死者之數字，及其戰敗情形，而美國陸軍次官，對此項消息，均秘而不宣，然此種昭然若揭之事實，實際上决不能欺瞞世人耳目。</p>
<p>敵方反攻路綫</p>
<p>敵方雖遭受重大犧牲，仍　猛烈反攻。而日本方面，由于英勇作戰，自第一期之資源確保後，刻巳進入第二期之充實戰力，故値此戰力充實之際，巳對來攻之敵方，予以果敢邀擊，而完成機滅敵軍之戰果。今日巳掌握利空權，確立不敗之戰略態勢，故日軍必獲最後勝利。</p>
<p>目前日本戰略上之勢力圈，雖於倫巴特·馬紹爾·所羅門等島，稍有損失，然決戰之內綫。則愈形　固，確信日單在時間空間上，必將達成預期之目的。</p>
<p>敵方自在夏威夷海戰慘敗後，其作戰手段，爲之一變。即發動大量艦隊及航空兵力，另一方面推進建立空軍基地，並以自身之空海集團，開始奇襲日軍前綫基地，企圖斷絕日軍後方之給養，　來敵方即以此種手段，企圖發動攻勢。由上述各種情形觀之，吾人可將地方反攻路綫，分爲五點：　阿拉斯加，阿里克西耶綫。　由夏威夷直達日本本土。　由馬紹爾·特魯克·巴拉瓦·菲律賓綫。　由所羅門·拉巴爾·新幾內亞綫。　印度洋貝列康綫。目下氣候漸佳，將於九月前出動大量艦隊，以牽制日方活動。一月來敵集中大量飛機及一部輕快艦艇，向日本千島之一角，施行偵查性砲擊，今日益見頻繁。該處地近日本中心，故日本之防禦，亦極堅強。</p>
<p>自企圖空襲日本本土，及艦隊決戰之見地看來，由夏威夷至日本之一綫爲最捷徑。然今日之美艦隊，以大艦隊聯合採取一致行動者爲多，由於中途無根據地，其補給即亦成爲問題。且敵艦隊多於基地航空隊之掩護下，施行作戰，故對此綫之採取，自非容易。果然今日敵之反攻路，巳顯示由中央突破之態勢，轉爲由西南北　。（未完）</p>

<p>蘇州二十八日中央社電　米糧統制委員會，爲澈底消滅米糧走私及隱國起見，頃對於米糧之查緝工作，進行頗爲努力，並爲使查緝工作全面展開起見，將於各地區設置檢查組，設置地點爲蘇州·吳江·松江·崑山·常州·無錫·宜與·常熟·嘉興·南京·丹陽·金壇·揚州·泰州·蕪湖·裕溪·鎭江，通州·硤石·　州。等二十處。今後之查緝工作，將依照下列各點積極進行：　與各地淸鄉當局取得密切連絡，各該當地檢查所，由該會派員帮同檢查運米商人所持證件之有效期間，及放運數量等。　對於各地米行米廠米棧，隨時實施存米登記。　重要區鎭設置密吿箱，受理關於米糧私運及囤積之密告。　必要時得請求各該當地軍警行政機關協同檢查。以上辦法，一旦普遍實行，對於民食前途，　益至爲組大云。</p>
<h3>抑平物價政策　渝方自認失敗　糧食不敷軍民需用</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　據渝電台廣播謂，渝方代表者於二十大日會見記者時，對去年來實施之物價平抑政策，率直承認巳歸完全失敗。其所述如次：最近數月之物價，若與一九三七年物價水準比較之，去年十二月爲二百倍，本年一月爲二百零八倍，二月爲二百三十倍，三月更趨勝貴。歷來之「公定價格」政策，不能抑壓，巳甚明顯。故「政府」於最近準備實施新經濟統制政策云。</p>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　渝政權於過去曾大事宣傳，謂本年度食糧因改向農民徵收實物，及强制收買關係，巳可不成問題。但於十四日糧食部長徐堪發表去年度糧政報告，對辦理成績，曾率直承認不諱。並對木年度糧食不足，軍民需用之情形，報吿如次：去年度實行田賦實物徵收制之結果，食糧仍不足用，待又强制收買後，始得彌補。該不足之一部，本年度如不將徵收與强制收買兩項同時强化，恐仍不足軍民之需要。又爲期米價之安定，固急待實施調整與貯藏辦法，但輸送之圓滑，亦實爲第一要件，關於此點尚期地方政府予以協力云。</p>

<h3>東綫南路蘇軍　發動新攻勢　戰事重心移雅賽北部</h3>
<p>柏林廿八日中央社電　德軍常局發表：南部地區蘇軍於二十八日巳將攻擊重點，自聶斯特河下一游移向雅賽（Jassy）北方地區，蘇軍於雅賽北方以新銳兵力開始攻擊，南聯軍之猛烈抵抗後巳遭失失。又蘇軍新攻勢之進展，南部地區巳爲東綫之主要戰綫，克里米亞半島於昨日曾展開局部戰鬥，德羅軍現在堅守陣地。</p>
<p>柏林廿八日中央社電　海通社訊：克里米亞繼績保持沉寂狀態，而東綫南路蘇軍之大攻勢，果又吿發動。喀爾巴仟山與斯丹尼斯勒伏以東，德洪軍績有推進，蘇東自塞爾諾蒂區發動反攻，未能阻止穗軍伸直戰綫。東綫中路之氣候，仍未許有大規模之軍事行動，北路則　有斥堠戰而巳。德空軍仍活躍前錢，且遠至敵方內地，偵得敵軍調動頗爲忙碌，內有自高加索方面調來者，可見其居心何在。德軍猛炸基輔·柯洛斯頓·法斯托夫·薩蘭尼等鐵路中心，以阻碍敵軍之集中。敵烏克蘭第三軍屢欲渡聶斯特柯未果，今又沿奧維蒂沃波爾及杜巴薩里一綫發動猛攻，企圖强渡。蒂格希納區蘇軍亦有重大壓力，惟德軍抵抗亦殊堅强。蘇軍企圓向蒂格希納突破，顯欲搖動基希尼夫以北之德軍防地，普魯斯河與塞列特河間蘇軍正沿廣大區域進攻。</p>
<h3>德國空軍　偵查英南部　集結重兵說完全無稽</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德空軍連日以强力之編隊，對英南部實行轟炸及偵察活動。二十七日正午德軍當局特發表如次：據　空軍偵察報吿，英南部反軸心軍集結一說，完全無稽，由以上證明反軸心方面所傳其於第一綫集結飛機一萬架，戰車八十輛之宣傳，僅係一種誇大之宣傳而巳。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦息：英王喬治二世昨日視察準備從事開關第二戰綫之英軍，當時英王並曾參觀各種機械化部隊·重坦克車隊及鐵甲車隊。</p>

<h3>德決以嚴峻態度　促土耳其反省　巴本大使返國述職</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　土耳其屈服於反軸心陣營後，該政府即實行撕毀德土通商條約，並決定停止對德輸出鉻鑛。穗政府巳鑒及此，乃曾飭令駐士大使巴本促士政府反省，但事態並未因此而見好轉，故德政府似巳決定以强硬熊度應付之。今巴太大使巳首途歸國，德外交部富局頃就此事談稱，一俟巴本大使歸國後，德國即將直接聽取該大使之報吿。衆認德政府此時或仍不致採取對土絕交之過激手段，但外交界人士認此時德政府最低限度，亦將筋令巴本大使歸任，而以冷靜態度觀察土政府今後之動向。</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德駐土大使巴本於二十七日抵斯丹埠，當即與土外長曼里卓格　進行會談，旋搭機飛往柏林。</p>
<h3>歐洲第二戰綫　何時發動</h3>
<p>本年一月中旬，德國宜傳部長郭培爾曾在「德意志」雜誌上斷言「敵方的侵略準備，業巳完成。」這聲明顯然是說德國巳有相當準備的對外宣傳。而德國報紙亦曾指出，敵方的侵略準備，至邋在二月底當可完成，不僅中立國方面承認此說，即英美的報道，亦直接間接的說明此事實。英本國巳集結了大量的兵力，資材，準備未來的侵攻戰役，這巳成爲歐洲人的常識了。然而那侵攻戰事究竟在什麼時發生，還未曾明瞭。</p>
<p>歐洲的新聞有二說：一說是六月中旬以內，一說是五月。前者所根據的意見，以爲實施侵攻戰事的先決條件，必須先由空襲以破壞德國的戰爭組織，此舉須費二個月的時間。後者所根據的觀測，三月四月東部戰綫因爲融雪而泥潭，蘇聯軍不能進擊，所以不能取大規模的攻勢以呼應央美軍的西歐登陸戰事。</p>
<p>對德空襲計算錯誤</p>
<p>但到現在這二說都不對了。先前以爲二個月足以破壞德國的戰爭組織者，後來聽了反軸心當局再三聲明：「增加空襲的規模與速度是必對必要的」，也不能不說估計錯誤了。</p>
<p>今日對德國本國及其前哨陣地所實施的轟炸，其規模雖然是空前的，但反軸心軍是否能由空襲而獲得勝利，或轟炸是否巳削弱德國到了英美所夢想的「安步登陸」的程度，頗成疑問。僅賴空襲要獲得勝利是不可能的。在德空軍的潛存力並大西洋要塞的堅固防衛下，反軸心軍不獨修改了空襲戰法，至最近且更見大爲强化了。</p>
<p>這樣，僅此反軸心軍强化空襲一事就可以明瞭，對於儘量延遲開始侵攻作戰時機的六月說，充再不聞，而在其反面，根據上述錯誤估計的五月說，反給與極大的影響。反軸心軍雖付出了任何犧牲，到那時候也將拚其死命實施西歐登陸作戰。</p>
<p>衛破泥濘，突入波蘭並羅馬尼亞的紅軍之進攻，在英美蘇的夾攻德國上，產生了所謂理想的狀况。同時，使英美方面愈感焦躁。不欲落後於與蘇聯的競爭，這種心緒，發動了從速着手侵攻戰役的傾向。</p>
<p>兩種理論對立</p>
<p>因有這二種對立，而在他們的侵攻政策上，產生了遲延論與提早實行論二說。要判斷他們幾時開始作戰的困難，就在於此。再說現在英美方面的苦境，除非戰局向不利德軍的方向變化，要突破　國的西方防綫，他們以爲是不可能的。而要造成這種變化，除了紅軍實施決定的進攻，或英美空軍長期問實行空襲以外，別無地法。</p>
<p>但長期的空襲，使德軍在東部配置最小的兵力，而在西部配置最大的兵力，結果，紅軍的進擎愈加深入。英美的指導者乃遭遇了政治的考慮，在軍事問題上所給與的影響，究竟到何種程度的重大問題。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的待機而動的戰略，巳經繼續四年了。他們在空軍沒有把德國淪爲平地之前，不開始攻擊，依然待機着。可是，他們所說的待機，也祗在英國的作戰地位未被蘇聯威脅的範圍內待機。</p>
<p>邱吉爾所主張的第二戰綫遷延策，以爲時間和地域的損失，至最後可以和蘇聯談判後取償的，所以議會反對雖烈，但關於作戰計劃和戰後計劃，邱吉爾之嚴守沉默，不僅暗示他的成算，且也象徽第二戰綫的延期。因此，把邱吉爾的政策分折起來，英美軍的侵攻西歐；今後數星期以內不會實行的看法，不能說沒有理由。是以第二戰綫的實施，將較一般人所預料者爲遲，大約將在夏季。（翔：譯自四月七日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>本市四團體歡迎小倉顧問　昨日舉行茶會情況熱烈</h3>
<p>新任國府最高經資顧問小倉正恒氏，日前由京來滬公幹，上海市民　利協會，工商聯誼會，中國國民外交促進會，及新聞聯合會等四團體，特於昨（二十入）日下午四時，在外　興亞大樓工商聯誼會會　廳，舉行茶會，表示歡迎之意。</p>
<p>出席人士</p>
<p>主賓小倉顧問曁新木顧問·宇山顧問，準時蒞會。來賓到梁院長·丁部長·吳外次·吳秘書長·渡副局長·蘇副局長·袁局長·孫局長·馮局長·孫處長·中田領事。四團體會員到船津理事長·青木·武內·　孝·賈本·赤松·日高·　蘭亭·李思浩·林康侯·袁　登·趙晋卿·葉扶　·項康原·許曉初·王伯元·　南　·丁福保·邵樹華·王海　·王叔腎·陳日平·陳紹嬀·許建屏·王懷廉·金宗城·姚俊之·雷愚之·沈叔玉·鮑國昌·許力求·顏加保·楊　浪·　保衡·凌大　·　雨　·張慰如·童侶青·宋卓哉·劉雲舫·任雲鵬等二百餘人，情況異常熱烈。當由市民福利協會代表聞關亭，工商聯誼會代表船津，國民外交促進會代表林康侯，新聞聯合會代表森山任主席團。首由聞出席致歡迎詞，繼由本報陳社長代表致詞，旋經小倉顧問致答謝詞，聞明今後協力我國建設經濟之決意，直至六時始實主　歡而散。茲分　演詞如下：</p>
<p>聞蘭亭主席辭</p>
<p>聞蘭亭主席致詞云：「小倉先生是盟邦日本經濟界權威，學問淵搏，經騐宏富，三十年前，即曾來華視察誣濟，已爲中國之友。此次膺國府最高經濟顧問之騁，必能出其學騐，爲中國戰時經濟建設致力，更爲中日經濟提携致力，觀於小倉先生在滬與機濟界及記者談話，更足證明他的觀察深刻，見解準確。今天上海工商聯誼會，市民福利協會，國民外交促進會，新聞聯合會四團體在此舉行茶會表示歡迎，幷致敬意。茲請陳彬　先生代表致詞」。</p>
<p>本報陳社長詞</p>
<p>本月廿五日小倉先生在滬接見中國記者團，發表談話，很多要點，我們頗有同感。小倉先生說：「上海經濟之復興，實爲今日中國經濟中重要課題之一，此後鑒於上海經濟之重要性，擬多來上海，與當地經濟界時作懇談」。我們站在上海經濟界的地位，特別感覺興趣。</p>
<p>小倉先生說：「中國經濟中最重要問題，厥在如何使中國之人力資源成爲戰力化，如何使人民生活得以安定」。本來任何參戰國家，都應充分做到這兩點。盟邦日本更是一個極好的榜樣，動員全國人力，增加種種生產，尤其是飛機產量與農業增產一致適應戰力化的目標。而物價低廉幾與平時相似。縱然艱苦，但很平均，所以人民生活頗爲安定。在盟邦的新聞紙上，可以看到。凡是到過日本的，均能親眼見到。中國也是參戰國家、可是很慘愧的，人力資源還是放任　　費，尚未配合到戰力化，而物價高漲，生產萎縮，人民生活亦不能安定。　如華中工業生產的病態：　組織散漫，大型工廠的開工率日見減低，產量日趨減少。　由於生產不集中，技術退化，管理不善，統制不良，以致影嚮原料消耗率增高　　品品質漸有偷工低落的傾向。　根本違反重點主義精神，一般工業均見萎縮，紡織本爲最大工業，而常前紡織業的萎縮情形，恐非任何一業爲甚。其次如農業生產，依據中國經濟硏究會調查，松江靑浦一帶，去年種植縠菜籽小麥三種作物，皆須　蝕。種穀每畝虧七十元，種小麥每畝虧一百五十四元，種菜籽每畝虧一百〇四元。又如領導物價上漲的米價高漲一，農民因收買價格過低，而不肯大量售出。收買機　作弊，配　量不能改善，黑市價格跳漲。米價上漲後，一切工資成本隨之增加，於是一般物價，也扶搖直上了。</p>
<p>依照常理，　　區內是物產最富庶之區，不應發生上述現象。所以我們始終認爲根本原因在於政治不上軌道，及人事不健全兩點。我們一向主張中國經濟問題之危機，決不是經濟措施單獨所可挽救，必須配合致治力量，應與革新政治用時並進。　小倉先生又說：「各國各有不同國情，故施策上將愼重檢討，以求最有效果之方法。如統制經濟方法，並非一成不變，須觀環境而異。就中國言，中國有其固有之民情習慣及傳說，故統制方法必須完全適合之，再加以客觀之分析而後可。若不如是，統制愈嚴，物資愈告缺乏，反與統制本議相背。故今後將硏究過去統　經濟失敗之原因並希望能糾正過去錯誤，以求改善。」這是最爲理智的判斷，搔着　處的觀察。我們於佩服小倉先生見識卓越之餘，尤爲中國經濟前途可能得到曙先而慶幸。</p>
<p>小倉先生不愧是一位學騐俱　的名醫，過去中國經濟病態的不能好轉，病人與醫生都要負責。現在聘到這位名醫，誠是幸運之至。現在診斷過了，所作的診斷方案非常準確，根據這張方案，必定有好的藥方擬出，針對病情施治。如果病人不能聽受醫生的指導用藥，因而無裨健康，當然是病人的責任，可是醫生抱服務病家的宏願，也常不辭煩厭，負責勸吿，務使接受可治。同時病家爲服稱醫生的指示，尤其請要自肅，　從，以期恢復健康。</p>
<p>小倉顧問答詞</p>
<p>旋由小倉顧問致答詞云：本人最近被任爲國民政府全國經濟委員會最高顧問，於就任後來滬拜訪各界，承蒙最有力之中國國民外交促進會，市民福利會，新聞聯合會，工商聯誼會四團體，聯合舉行盛大茶會，歡迎本人，表示非常惑謝。回憶去年七月聞，本人曾以中日交驩民間經濟使節團團長資格來滬，當時亦承各位種種賜教。故本人對各位此種盛情厚誼，尤其表示無限之敬意與謝意。本人去年來滬之意義，乃爲貴國國府於去年初，對英美宣戰，表明與日本協力向繫滅英美之金邁進。日太政府對此亦採取撒消治外法權交還租界等措置，逐步實行所謂對華新政策。此項對華新政策澈底實行之後，聞中國經濟界亦逐漸瞭解日本眞意，進一步與日本誣濟界攜手。太人爲視察中國經濟狀況，並與中國經濟界及政府官吏懇談，開誠布公，交換意見。藉圖兩國經濟界心理的融洽，以期貢獻兩國經濟切實提攜起見，即偕明石南鄉小寺諸先生蒞臨貴國。此次就任國府最高經濟顧問，本人深感無限愧悼與光榮，當國府携聘請本人時，本人即深感年齡高大，終非適當者，曾婉言辭謝，然因貴國朝野之熱誠，終告接受。本人深知最高經濟顧問職務繁重，恐不能做到令諸位爲滿足之成績。今後當盡量鞭策目己，專誠努力，希望諸位常常賜予充分之指導與援助。</p>
<p>本人以爲中日兩國關並非對立，兩國應共存共榮，爲中國盡力，即篇日本盡力，貴國國父孫中山先生曾云：「無日本即無中國」，本人堅決信仰此言。以中國之立塲協力日本，其結果乃完全爲中國。例如努力中國民生安定及中國經濟復興，即可使日本戰力增強，因此日本可以戰勝，得完成大東亞之建設。關於此點，此次與本人同來貴國就任國府主任誣濟顧間之日本銀行理事新木先生，亦有同惑。至於中國經濟之運用，本人以爲原則上必須以中國經濟家及國府主腦之創意與責任爲基本，自主推進。本人與國府當局毋庸贅言，即與中國經濟家亦當開誠懇談，盡本人力量，協助中國。但本人始終立於側面，竭力工作。關於中日經濟家心理之融洽，本人在日時曾略盡棉力，此次蒞任，準備更加盡力，由於此種見解，打算常住上海，俾與各界交接意見。因實施新政策尙在過渡時期，兩國經濟界之間，極易發生誤會，故希望兩國經濟界今後互相諒解，所謂捨小我而就大同，本人對此亦擬克盡一切努力。中日兩國經濟，本人以爲必需互以不足相補，以求完壁。中國地大物博，與日本之技術及工業力，互倚互助，此乃目然之理，且爲東亞興隆之根本。我們應以同盟條約精神，相互協力於增強戰力安定中國民生上，盡最大努力。但爲增強戰力，本人以爲復與上海經濟，乃目前最緊急之要務，因此希望諸位更進一步盡力，租界消滅後，於主權完整下之上海，解除英美之束縛，一新面目，成爲中國之上海，此不僅爲中國，且爲整個大東亞全民族同申慶賀者。關於上海之將來，雖有種種意見，本人相信此後長期仍將爲中國工商業中心地，本人對此重要之上海，當盡本人棉力。爲上海經濟復興與發展而努力。</p>
<p>剛才承主人指示中國經濟問題種種處理方法，種種意思，本人巳很瞭解。本人原是在野之身，做事向來注重實效，袛要有寶效，就不辭困雜去做。不過，本人是一個平凡的人，所以也只能做平凡的事。承蒙主人的誇獎，實在不敢當。但以後對於各方面意見，如有實效，自當盡力做去，酬答各位。</p>
<p>末後，對於諸位盛大茶會，並且得到機會與上海各界有地位八士見面，非常感謝與榮幸。</p>
<p>小倉顧問在歡迎茶會席上致詞</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>修羅（一）</p>
<p>一九三八年的求天——是偵人到檀香山去的正一年前的事。</p>
<p>近東京新市區的高圓寺軍站。有一條馬路元全是咖啡館和飯店，在一個偏僻地方，　　的門　上寫許「烤雞」的飯館裹，有兩個人在對面喝着酒。</p>
<p>好像兩個人都不能喝酒，因爲在油漆巳經沒有了的桌而上，只攫　兩個小酒壺，但吃剩下的烤雞骨頭，卻在　子裹很多。</p>
<p>秋夜的燈似乎有點發冷，　着帶油的烟，當有　電車通過的時候。地板都顫抖地搖助着，是　樣一個小店鋪。</p>
<p>「你這樣說，就是　疑美的本質」。這樣說的一個男子，穿着當時很流行的帶邊的西裝，裹面穿務黑色襯衫，所以很像電影裹的大導演，但實際上，是二科會附近相當有名的畫家鶴原氏</p>
<p>「是那樣麽？然而，我……」說著很低而且憂　的聲音，並非反駁對方的話，而說着話，便把額蓋上順下來的長長頭髮，用手掠到頭頂上，帶着眼鏡，凝視着桌上，這樣另外一位靑年，說話的聲音雖然非常年靑，而面孔卻看着有二十四五歲的樣子。</p>
<p>在巳經褪色了的斜紋呢領子裹，暫時把下顎藏到裹面的他，又開始用孱弱的聲音說話了。</p>
<p>「然而，我……雖然不是說書上的蘋菓不美麗，但塞尙（Cezanne一八三九—九〇六年，法國印像派畫家—譯者）書的蘋菓，雖無處不美，但自己卻沒有書蘋菓的志趣」。</p>
<p>「你不耍說這樣矛盾的話。你說塞尙書的蘋菓很美，這就是證明你對靜物的美有認識。這樣你反而沒有畫的志趣，究竟是什麼道理呢」？鶴原很　直地這樣說。</p>
<p>「唉，這一點，我自己也不明白」。靑年的回答雖然很模糊，但又不像是說謊的樣子。</p>
<p>「你，總不會是討厭靜物的吧」！鶴原稍徽夾雜一點感情這樣說。這是因爲他本身是像法國流行畫家一樣，喜歡畫花，果，壺等的靜物畫家</p>
<p>一決不是討厭。只是自己不想畫。這不空對靜物是如此。老實說，對於人體也不惑興味。對於風景也不特別惑覺興味」。</p>

<h3>Discussion of Adjusting Control Organizations</h3>
<p>Recently, discussions about adjusting control organizations have been rife. We have seen that in the past year, the systems of control organizations have been diverse, and their authority has been inconsistent, leading to those in charge being overwhelmed and exhausted, while those being controlled have suffered greatly and complained about excessive burdens. We deeply feel that such a situation requires change and adjustment. Although the matter of material control may not be deeply understood by our countrymen who have long been accustomed to freedom, the general trend is that countries around the world, regardless of their past doctrines or policies, are all moving towards control. Our country has always been backward in production. In order to regulate supply and demand during extraordinary times, implementing control is a necessity. Therefore, there is no need to discuss whether the policy can be changed. What should be examined is how to adjust the control organization and how to improve the control methods, so that it can benefit the war effort and the people, without harming the war effort or the people. In this way, the control policy can gain the support and endorsement of the people and be successful.</p>
<p>The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has been more than a year. At the beginning of its establishment, the authorities promoted the idea of "commercial self-governance and control." Examining its content, all directors and supervisors were appointed by the government, which did not match the name and reality. The only reason for this was that the lower-level organizations had not yet been fully established, elections could not be held, and directors and supervisors could not be produced. However, the implementation of control could not be delayed for even a moment, so this expedient measure had to be temporarily adopted as a transitional phase. Here, we deeply understand the environmental facts at the time and do not want to harshly criticize from a strict standpoint. Now, a year has passed, and various industry guilds and federations have been successively organized and established in accordance with the law. It is especially appropriate to hold re-elections within a limited time to conform to the spirit of commercial self-governance. For the various industry guilds, they should also recognize the relationship between control and their own industry, uphold impartiality, and carefully select candidates who can truly represent their industry. Those elected should not shirk their responsibilities or make excuses but should fulfill their responsibilities to their industry and seek welfare for the society and the people. This applies to the directors and supervisors at the highest level of the organization. As for the organizations below the directors and supervisors, there are also some that should be improved in the various departments of the Commercial Control Association in the past. For example, the Commercial Control Association has a Materials Department, which, as the name implies, should be in charge of all controlled materials. However, in reality, rice and grain control has the Rice and Grain Control Association, and cotton control has the Cotton Control Association, both of which are directly under the Executive Yuan and operate independently from the Commercial Control Association, and the Materials Department below the Commercial Control Association cannot intervene. If the government considers this kind of separate control method appropriate, then why are controlled items other than rice, grain, and cotton still handled by the Commercial Control Association? And why isn't edible oil, which is also a staple food, included in the Rice Control Association? Cotton products, which use cotton as raw material, have been approved by the Executive Yuan to be transferred from the Commercial Control Association to the Cotton Control Association, but the Cotton Control Association has not yet received them. It is confusing and unclear, leaving outsiders in a state of bewilderment. What is even more fragmented is that the Commercial Control Association is nominally national, but in reality, there are branches in Wuhan, Guangdong, and North China, with different methods and no communication with each other. At the same time, the Japan Trade Company in Central China has a large organization and often purchases, transports, and sells large quantities of controlled goods, which is similar to the Commercial Control Association. Furthermore, regarding controlled items such as coal and tobacco, the allocation and pricing are beyond the purview of the Commercial Control Association. With such a fragmented and chaotic system, it is difficult to exert its function and implement national policies!</p>
<p>At a time when all parties unanimously advocate adjusting the organization, we would like to offer the following points in good faith:</p>
<p>First, it should be determined whether the adjusted control organization will be unified or based on separate classifications. If it is unified, the local branches should be subordinate to the general association, and the Rice Control Association and the Cotton Control Association should also be converted into professional departments of the Commercial Control Association. In addition, anything else that may affect or hinder the unification of the control organization, regardless of whether it is domestic or foreign, should be eliminated. Conversely, if a separate approach is adopted, the existence of the Commercial Control Association is redundant and should be abolished altogether to be rational.</p>
<p>The types of controlled goods should be re-examined closely. Those that are not important to people's livelihood and have not been thoroughly controlled in the past, or those that are nominally controlled but are not actually controlled, only giving unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to engage in corruption and increase the suffering of the people, should be resolutely removed from control to allow free circulation, which can indirectly promote the effect of price stabilization.</p>
<p>After determining the controlled and non-controlled materials, the licensing system should be re-examined accordingly. All non-controlled items should have their licensing requirements abolished to promote the smooth exchange of materials.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem in implementing control is to promote production. If production is insufficient, no matter how the control organization is adjusted or how sound it is, and no matter how perfect the control methods are, they will eventually be exhausted. To ensure the smooth implementation of the control policy, increasing production is essential and cannot be ignored. On this point, government agencies and social organizations should each use their full strength to promote it separately and strive to achieve results in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Sends Telegram of Congratulations on the Japanese Emperor's Birthday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The 29th is the Japanese Emperor's Birthday, the national day of our allied nation. Chairman Wang and Foreign Minister Chu sent separate telegrams of congratulations. The telegrams read as follows:</p>
<p>To His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire: On the auspicious occasion of Your Majesty's birthday on the 29th of this month, I, as Chairman of the National Government, on behalf of the National Government and the people of this country, extend to Your Majesty my most sincere congratulations and wish your country prosperity. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>To His Excellency Aoki, Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Tokyo: On the auspicious occasion of your country's Emperor's Birthday on the 29th of this month, I send this telegram to convey my congratulations. I respectfully request that this be submitted to His Majesty. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Squadrons Active in Indian Territory to Prevent Enemy Aerial Resupply; Over 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Two Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th: The encirclement and attack on the Imphal Basin by the Japanese-Indian allied forces have been progressing smoothly recently. The fate of the British-Indian Fourth Army Corps within the basin is imminent. Because the enemy's rear lines of communication have been cut off by the Japanese-Indian forces, they have mobilized the transport aircraft of the enemy's air transport units in the supply-added areas and the total air power of Eastern India to cooperate in the Imphal defensive battle. They are supplying ammunition and food from the air. The fate of Imphal currently depends on the success of aerial resupply. Japanese air squadrons in the Burma area have been active over the Imphal front for several days, cooperating with ground forces in combat and preventing enemy aerial resupply. It is estimated that 12 enemy transport aircraft (four of which are unconfirmed) and 11 fighter aircraft were shot down on the 25th and 26th, and 8 transport aircraft parked on land were destroyed. On the 25th, a Japanese fighter squadron attacked the enemy air transport unit's bases in Sylhet and Hailakandi. During the attack, they discovered groups of enemy transport aircraft escorted by fighter aircraft and attacked them. After fierce fighting, 11 enemy BC3 transport aircraft and 3 Spitfire fighter aircraft, totaling 14 aircraft, were shot down. On the 26th at noon, when attacking the Imphal Basin, they discovered BC3 transport aircraft groups fully loaded with reinforcements and supplies about to land at the Imphal North and South airfields. They immediately carried out a strong attack, severely damaging 8 of them and shooting down 7 Spitfire fighter aircraft and 1 Hurricane fighter aircraft that were patrolling. On the same day, another squadron discovered a large four-engine transport aircraft with Soviet markings escorted by two fighter aircraft about 30 kilometers northeast of Imphal. They immediately attacked it and, after one and a half hours, finally shot it down over Fort Hertz in the Putao area, inflicting a major blow on the enemy air force. The Japanese lost only one aircraft on the 25th that did not return and one aircraft that self-detonated on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Indian Forces Occupy Tiddim and Kennedy Peak</h3>
<p>Indian Front, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese-Indian forces' attack on Palel, the southeastern fortress of the Imphal Basin, is intensifying. The last Sapasang Pass position of the Palel fortress is on the verge of collapse. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese-Indian forces completely occupied Tiddim and Kennedy Peak and broke into the first line of defense of the Sapasang Pass position in one fell swoop, immediately occupying it. Fierce battles are taking place between the two sides in positions only 200 meters apart. On the 25th, the army launched a night attack on the entire line, breaking into the enemy's second line of defense. The two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat, gradually approaching the main positions of the enemy forces in Sapasang Pass and continuously launching fierce attacks. In addition, Japanese troops near Tonzang have also advanced to the Tiddim area, launching night attacks and occupying Phalam, threatening the Sapasang fortress from the flank. The enemy forces boasted that the Palel position could be defended for two months, but since the Japanese army began its attack on the 10th of this month, it has repeatedly launched fierce attacks and is expected to break through soon. The enemy's 20th Division and a part of the 23rd Division, about 3,000 men, mostly British and American troops, defending that area have suffered heavy losses from the Japanese-Indian army's fierce attacks. From the 22nd to the 24th, more than 300 enemy soldiers were killed in action in three days.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese units fighting in the Kaladan area have occupied Paletwa, the enemy's counter-offensive base, and are pressing the enemy forces. One unit has approached a point several kilometers southwest of Kaladan (30 kilometers north of Paletwa). Other units are gradually seizing the enemy positions on the left bank of the Kaladan River.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Truk Shot Down, Two Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - Yesterday morning, about 20 enemy large aircraft attacked Truk Island. After the Japanese army intercepted them, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Fighting in Progress on the North Coast of New Guinea; Enemy Landing in Hollandia Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 28th: Under the cover of powerful mobile units, enemy troops began landing near Hollandia and Aitape in New Guinea on the morning of April 22nd. Since then, they have gradually increased their forces. Japanese army units and air units in the area are engaged in combat with the enemy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a telegram from Canberra, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Headquarters announced on the 24th: With the support of the Allied naval and air forces, they landed in Aitape and Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea on the 22nd and suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Attacks Enemy Ship in the Eastern Sea Area of the Marshall Islands; Large Aircraft Carrier Hit by a Torpedo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on April 28th: On April 16th, a Japanese submarine attacked a large enemy aircraft carrier in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands, hitting it with two torpedoes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - To prevent the persistent enemy from stirring up trouble in the Pacific Ocean, Japanese submarines have maintained close contact with the garrisons and air units in various places, continuing to search for enemy ships. On the 16th of this month, a Japanese submarine discovered two large enemy aircraft carriers in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands and immediately began a torpedo attack, hitting one of them with two torpedoes, severely damaging it, or possibly sinking it. After this submarine severely damaged the enemy aircraft carrier, it is expected that the US reinforcements sailing from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands will be strictly patrolled in the future. It is difficult to use only a periscope for searching on the vast sea. This time, the Japanese submarine overcame difficulties, using radio wave weapons and patrol aircraft to form a strict surveillance network, and launched torpedoes in broad daylight. This kind of courage is truly shocking to the world.</p>

<h3>Japan's Powerful War Strength; Confident of Achieving Victory; Director Matsushima Gives Speech in Kyoto</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Kyoto Dispatch - Colonel Matsushima, the press director of the Japanese Fleet in China, gave a speech at the Youth Hall at 7:30 PM on the 27th, entitled "The Autumn of the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle." His analysis of the current war situation was very detailed, and he gave accurate instructions on Japan's assured victory in the war. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Determining the Fate of Japan and Germany</p>
<p>The current war situation in the world and East Asia has undergone significant changes. In the Eastern Pacific, the British and Americans are rapidly launching aggressive operations, while in Western Europe, they are forming a second front against Germany. The former is enough to determine Japan's fate, while the latter will determine the fate of the Allied powers. This is self-evident. The British and Americans are becoming increasingly anxious to end the war quickly, attempting to change the situation within their countries and sustain the fighting spirit of their people. All of this is not easy to achieve, and their only hope is to strengthen their productive capacity, hoping that it will contribute to success on the battlefield. Since the British and Americans have emphasized large-scale offensive operations, they appear to be very active in combat on the surface. However, because the Japanese army's defense is strong and its combat is brave, the outcome of the war has already been determined. On April 14th, King, the operations director under the commander of the US Combined Fleet, stated in the House Committee that "to carry out the war against Japan, we will suffer huge sacrifices in the next six months, and the American people must be aware of this." Furthermore, domestic broadcasts stated, "Since the start of the war, the US Navy's fleet and materials were initially very substantial. The Japanese Navy has observed this for several months and is very clear about it." On April 23rd, a US Navy official broadcasted, "The US Navy's preparedness and operational intentions can be observed from the fighting spirit of the naval officers and soldiers." When the US Navy engaged in the Greater East Asia War, it planned to expand its forces, attempting to complete the two-ocean fleet by the end of this year. The following is a record of the existing naval combat power of the United States in 1941 (Showa 16) (including those under construction):</p>
<p>(Completed) (Under Construction)</p>
<p>Battleships 17 15</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers 7 11</p>
<p>Cruisers 37 54</p>
<p>Destroyers 171 193</p>
<p>Submarines 113 73</p>
<p>However, since the naval battle of Hawaii, enemy ships have suffered enormous losses. More than 120 shipyards across the country have been fully mobilized to actively build ships in order to make up for the losses at that time. According to Knox's statement in March, the ships that are about to be completed currently include 21 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, etc., totaling more than 50 ships. In order to replenish other ships, they are currently actively building them. Since January, the Nimitz fleet has broken into the Japanese interior South Pacific islands from the Marshall Islands, attempting to attack the Philippines. On the other hand, they want to split the Japanese mainland and the important resource areas in the south. Therefore, they launched a fierce decisive battle with the main force of the Japanese Navy. At this point, the war is progressing rapidly, and the enemy is deeply anxious. This is due to the Japanese army's skillful strategy, seizing air supremacy, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses, especially in terms of population. This is an undeniable fact. However, the enemy is accustomed to using deceptive propaganda to deceive their citizens, and they have never truthfully published their own losses. For example, recently the Japanese authorities announced the number of enemy deaths and their defeat, but the US Undersecretary of the Army concealed this information. However, this obvious fact cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the world.</p>
<p>Enemy Counter-Offensive Routes</p>
<p>Although the enemy has suffered heavy sacrifices, they are still launching a fierce counter-offensive. On the Japanese side, thanks to brave combat, after securing resources in the first phase, they have now entered the second phase of replenishing their combat power. Therefore, at this time of replenishing combat power, they have bravely intercepted the attacking enemy and completed the battle achievements of annihilating the enemy army. Today, they have seized air supremacy and established an invincible strategic posture. Therefore, the Japanese army will surely win the final victory.</p>
<p>Although the current Japanese strategic sphere of influence has suffered some losses in the Lombard, Marshall, and Solomon Islands, the decisive inner line is becoming increasingly solid. It is believed that Japan will definitely achieve its expected goals in time and space.</p>
<p>After suffering a disastrous defeat in the naval battle of Hawaii, the enemy's combat methods have changed. That is, they launch a large number of fleets and air forces, and on the other hand, they promote the establishment of air force bases. They also use their own air and sea groups to launch surprise attacks on Japanese front-line bases, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply. The enemy will use this method to launch an offensive. From the above situations, we can divide the local counter-offensive routes into five points: Alaska, Aleutian Line. Directly from Hawaii to the Japanese mainland. From the Marshall, Truk, Palau, Philippines Line. From the Solomon, Rabaul, New Guinea Line. Indian Ocean Bay of Bengal Line. The weather is gradually improving, and a large fleet will be dispatched before September to contain Japanese activities. Since January, the enemy has concentrated a large number of aircraft and some light and fast ships to carry out reconnaissance shelling of one corner of the Japanese Kuril Islands, which is becoming increasingly frequent today. Because this place is close to the center of Japan, Japan's defense is also extremely strong.</p>
<p>From the point of view of attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland and a decisive fleet battle, the line from Hawaii to Japan is the most direct route. However, today's American fleet mostly takes unified action with a large fleet. Because there is no base along the way, its supply also becomes a problem. Moreover, the enemy fleet mostly operates under the cover of base air forces. Therefore, it is not easy to take this line. Indeed, today the enemy's counter-offensive route has shown a tendency to shift from a central breakthrough to breakthroughs from the west, south, and north. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Grain Policy Plan Focuses on Increasing Production; Rice Control Association Establishes Inspection Teams Everywhere</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to implement wartime administrative streamlining to adapt to the wartime system and achieve great efficiency during the war, the National Government authorities previously decided to abolish the Ministry of Food and transfer all matters related to grain administration to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It will be officially implemented on May 1st. After Mr. Chen Chunpu, Minister of Construction, was ordered to head Guangdong, his vacancy was also officially filled by Mr. Chen Guofu, Minister of Industry and Commerce, by order of the National Government. It is heard that Mr. Chen is scheduled to officially take office on May 1st. Because grain and construction industries and other administrations are the most important departments in the wartime economic system, the reporter specially visited Mr. Chen Guofu, Minister of Industry and Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the future grain policy plan and the key points of construction administration. The minister gave the following summary answer: (Question) After the Ministry of Food is merged into the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, what will be the future direction for promoting grain policy? (Answer) In the future, the promotion of grain policy will focus on increasing production and facilitating transportation as the current urgent priorities. As for the negative aspects, the implementation of frugality and the reduction of unnecessary grain consumption will also be implemented. (Question) What are the results of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's dispatch of personnel to investigate the current situation of factories in Shanghai, and what are the remedial measures for the future? (Answer) The work of investigating factories is currently underway. In addition to planning to make the most of existing raw materials, fuels, and power, and avoiding unnecessary consumption, we will also try to dredge the sources of raw materials and fuels and provide various necessary assistance to the factories. (Question) What will be the future administrative policy of the Ministry of Construction? (Answer) I have been away from the Ministry of Construction for several months, and all plans will be decided after discussion. However, transportation and other issues related to increased production will naturally be the focus of future administration.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to completely eliminate rice smuggling and concealment, the Rice and Grain Control Committee has been working hard to investigate and deal with rice. In order to fully launch the investigation work, inspection teams will be set up in various regions. The locations for the establishment are Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, Jiaxing, Nanjing, Danyang, Jintan, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Wuhu, Yuxi, Zhenjiang, Tongzhou, Xiashi, Huzhou, and other 20 places. In the future, the investigation work will be carried out actively in accordance with the following points: 1. Establish close contact with the local Qingxiang authorities. The local inspection stations will send personnel to help check the validity period of the certificates held by the rice transport merchants and the quantity of rice released. 2. Implement rice inventory registration for rice shops, rice factories, and rice warehouses in various places at any time. 3. Set up secret reporting boxes in important towns to accept secret reports about rice smuggling and hoarding. 4. If necessary, request the cooperation of local military, police, and administrative agencies to conduct inspections. Once the above measures are widely implemented, the prospects for people's food will be greatly improved.</p>
<h3>Price Suppression Policy Recognized as a Failure in Chongqing; Food Insufficient for Military and Civilian Needs</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a broadcast by the Chongqing radio station, the representatives of the Chongqing side admitted frankly when meeting with reporters on the 20th that the price suppression policy implemented since last year has completely failed. Their statement was as follows: Comparing the prices in recent months with the price level in 1937, the price level in December last year was 200 times, 208 times in January this year, 230 times in February, and even more expensive in March. It is very obvious that the long-standing "official price" policy cannot be suppressed. Therefore, the "government" is preparing to implement a new economic control policy.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Chongqing regime had previously publicized extensively that this year's food supply would not be a problem because of the change to collecting in-kind from farmers and compulsory purchases. However, on the 14th, Xu Kan, Minister of Food, released a report on the grain administration for the past year and frankly admitted that the results were not satisfactory. He reported the following about the shortage of food this year and the needs of the military and civilians: As a result of implementing the system of in-kind tax collection last year, the food supply was still insufficient, and it had to be made up by compulsory purchases. If the two items of collection and compulsory purchase are not strengthened at the same time this year, it is feared that it will still be insufficient to meet the needs of the military and civilians. Also, in order to stabilize the price of rice, it is urgent to implement adjustment and storage measures, but smooth transportation is also the first requirement. It is hoped that the local governments will cooperate in this regard.</p>
<h3>US Air Force in Chongqing Indiscriminately Bombs Northern Thailand; Many People Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked northern Thailand on the 23rd and 24th, indiscriminately bombing various places. The Supreme Command of the Thai Army issued the following statement on the 27th: Several enemy aircraft attacked various places in northern Thailand on the 23rd and 24th, indiscriminately bombing them and strafing the local people with machine guns, causing considerable damage, deaths, and injuries. The purpose of this enemy attack was not to attack military targets, but to intimidate the general public.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Truk Shot Down, Two Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - Yesterday morning, about 20 enemy large aircraft attacked Truk Island. After the Japanese army intercepted them, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Fighting in Progress on the North Coast of New Guinea; Enemy Landing in Hollandia Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 28th: Under the cover of powerful mobile units, enemy troops began landing near Hollandia and Aitape in New Guinea on the morning of April 22nd. Since then, they have gradually increased their forces. Japanese army units and air units in the area are engaged in combat with the enemy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a telegram from Canberra, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Headquarters announced on the 24th: With the support of the Allied naval and air forces, they landed in Aitape and Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea on the 22nd and suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Attacks Enemy Ship in the Eastern Sea Area of the Marshall Islands; Large Aircraft Carrier Hit by a Torpedo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on April 28th: On April 16th, a Japanese submarine attacked a large enemy aircraft carrier in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands, hitting it with two torpedoes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - To prevent the persistent enemy from stirring up trouble in the Pacific Ocean, Japanese submarines have maintained close contact with the garrisons and air units in various places, continuing to search for enemy ships. On the 16th of this month, a Japanese submarine discovered two large enemy aircraft carriers in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands and immediately began a torpedo attack, hitting one of them with two torpedoes, severely damaging it, or possibly sinking it. After this submarine severely damaged the enemy aircraft carrier, it is expected that the US reinforcements sailing from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands will be strictly patrolled in the future. It is difficult to use only a periscope for searching on the vast sea. This time, the Japanese submarine overcame difficulties, using radio wave weapons and patrol aircraft to form a strict surveillance network, and launched torpedoes in broad daylight. This kind of courage is truly shocking to the world.</p>

<h3>Surge in Students Studying in Japan</h3>

These students are all eager to study various specialized new knowledge in education, industry, medicine, etc., in order to devote themselves to the construction work in various southern regions upon returning home after completing their studies. A total of 270 students from Manchukuo and China entered various specialized schools in the new semester of this year.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch New Offensive on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front; Focus of the War Shifts to Northern Jassy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command announced: On the 28th, Soviet forces in the southern region shifted their main attack from the lower reaches of the Dniester River to the northern Jassy area. Soviet forces began attacking north of Jassy with fresh troops, and after fierce resistance from the Southern Allied forces, they were lost. With the progress of the new Soviet offensive, the southern region has become the main front of the Eastern Front. Local battles unfolded in the Crimean Peninsula yesterday, and German and Romanian troops are now firmly holding their positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: Crimea remains in a state of calm, while the major offensive by Soviet forces on the southern route of the Eastern Front has indeed been launched again. East of the Carpathian Mountains and Stanislaviv, German and Hungarian troops have made progress. Soviet forces launched a counterattack from the Czernowitz area but failed to prevent the German army from straightening its lines. The climate in the central section of the Eastern Front still does not permit large-scale military operations, while the northern route only involves skirmishes. The German Air Force remains active at the front lines, and even far into enemy territory, detecting busy enemy troop movements, including those transferred from the Caucasus region, revealing their intentions. The German army fiercely bombed railway centers such as Kyiv, Korosten, Fastov, and Zhmerinka to hinder the concentration of enemy forces. The enemy's Third Ukrainian Front has repeatedly attempted to cross the Dniester River but failed, and is now launching fierce attacks along the Ovidiopol and Dubasari lines, attempting to force a crossing. Soviet forces in the Tighina region are also exerting significant pressure, but German resistance is also particularly strong. The Soviet attempt to break through towards Tighina clearly aims to shake the German defenses north of Kishinev. Soviet forces are attacking across a wide area between the Prut River and the Siret River.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Reconnoiters Southern England; Claims of Assembling Large Forces Are Utter Nonsense</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – For several days, the German Air Force has been conducting bombing and reconnaissance operations over southern England with powerful formations. At noon on the 27th, the German authorities specifically announced the following: According to Air Force reconnaissance reports, the claim that anti-Axis forces are assembling in southern England is utter nonsense. This proves that the anti-Axis propaganda claiming that they have assembled 10,000 aircraft and 80 tanks on the front line is merely an exaggerated propaganda tactic.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: London dispatch: King George VI of England inspected the British troops preparing to engage in the opening of the Second Front yesterday. During his visit, the King also inspected various mechanized units, heavy tank units, and armored vehicle units.</p>
<p>British Naval Commander Ramsay Reinstated</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: London dispatch: Vice-Admiral Ramsay, the British commander in charge of the Dunkirk evacuation, has been reinstated as of yesterday and has been promoted to Admiral.

<h3>Germany Determined to Urge Turkey to Reflect with a Stern Attitude; Ambassador Papen Returns Home to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – After Turkey yielded to the anti-Axis camp, the government implemented the abrogation of the German-Turkish trade treaty and decided to stop exporting chromium ore to Germany. The German government has taken this into consideration and ordered Ambassador Papen stationed in Turkey to urge the Turkish government to reflect, but the situation has not improved as a result. Therefore, the German government seems to have decided to deal with it with a tough attitude. Now, Ambassador Papen has embarked on his journey back home. A director of the German Foreign Ministry recently commented on this matter, saying that once Ambassador Papen returns home, Germany will directly listen to the ambassador's report. It is generally believed that the German government will not yet take the drastic measure of severing diplomatic relations with Turkey at this time, but diplomatic circles believe that, at a minimum, the German government will order Ambassador Papen to return to his post and observe the future actions of the Turkish government with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German Ambassador to Turkey Papen arrived in Istanbul on the 27th and immediately held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, before flying to Berlin.</p>
<h3>When Will the Second Front in Europe Be Launched?</h3>
<p>In mid-January of this year, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels asserted in "Das Reich" magazine that "the enemy's invasion preparations have already been completed." This statement was clearly a form of external propaganda indicating that Germany had made considerable preparations. German newspapers also pointed out that the enemy's invasion preparations could be completed by the end of February at the latest. Not only neutral countries acknowledged this claim, but reports from both Britain and the United States directly and indirectly illustrated this fact. Britain itself has amassed a large amount of troops and supplies, preparing for future invasion campaigns, which has become common knowledge in Europe. However, exactly when that invasion campaign will take place remains unclear.</p>
<p>European news has two theories: one is within mid-June, and the other is in May. The former is based on the opinion that a prerequisite for implementing an invasion campaign is to first use air raids to destroy Germany's war organization, a move that will take two months. The latter is based on the observation that the Eastern Front in March and April will be muddy due to melting snow, and the Soviet army will not be able to advance, so it will not be able to take large-scale offensives to echo the landing operations in Western Europe by the Central Allied forces.</p>
<p>Miscalculation of Air Raids Against Germany</p>
<p>But now both theories are wrong. Those who previously thought that two months would be enough to destroy Germany's war organization, after hearing the anti-Axis authorities' repeated statements that "increasing the scale and speed of air raids is absolutely necessary," cannot help but say that they underestimated.</p>
<p>Although the scale of the bombings carried out today against Germany proper and its forward positions is unprecedented, it is questionable whether the anti-Axis forces can achieve victory through air raids, or whether the bombing has weakened Germany to the extent of the "easy landing" dreamed of by Britain and the United States. Relying solely on air raids to achieve victory is impossible. With the latent power of the German Air Force and the solid defense of the Atlantic Fortress, the anti-Axis forces have not only revised their air raid tactics, but have also recently greatly strengthened them.</p>
<p>In this way, from the fact that the anti-Axis forces have strengthened their air raids, it can be understood that the June theory, which delays the start of the invasion operation as much as possible, is no longer heard, and on the contrary, the May theory, based on the above-mentioned miscalculations, has given a great influence. Even if they have to pay any sacrifice, the anti-Axis forces will risk their lives to implement the Western European landing operation by that time.</p>
<p>The invasion of the Red Army, breaking through the mud and entering Poland and Romania, has created the so-called ideal situation in the combined attack on Germany by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it has made the British and American sides increasingly anxious. Not wanting to fall behind in competition with the Soviet Union, this sentiment has triggered a tendency to launch the invasion campaign as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Two Opposing Theories</p>
<p>Due to these two opposing theories, two schools of thought have emerged in their invasion policy: a theory of delay and a theory of early implementation. The difficulty in judging when they will start the war lies in this. Furthermore, the current predicament of the British and American sides is that, unless the war situation changes in a direction unfavorable to the German army, they believe it is impossible to break through Germany's Western defenses. And to create this change, there is no other way except for the Red Army to implement a decisive offensive, or for the British and American air forces to carry out long-term air raids.</p>
<p>However, long-term air raids have enabled the German army to deploy the smallest possible force in the east and the largest possible force in the west. As a result, the Red Army's offensive has become even more in-depth. The leaders of Britain and the United States have encountered a major problem: the extent of the impact that political considerations have had on military issues.</p>
<p>Churchill's strategy of waiting and seeing has continued for four years. They will not start the attack until the air force has turned Germany into a level plain, still waiting for the opportunity. However, their so-called waiting is only within the scope of the British operational position not being threatened by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Churchill's proposed Second Front procrastination strategy believes that the loss of time and territory can be compensated for by negotiating with the Soviet Union in the end. Therefore, although parliamentary opposition is fierce, Churchill's strict silence on the operational plan and post-war plan not only implies his calculations, but also symbolizes the postponement of the Second Front. Therefore, analyzing Churchill's policy, the view that the British and American armies will not implement the invasion of Western Europe in the coming weeks cannot be said to be without reason. Therefore, the implementation of the Second Front will be later than generally expected, probably in the summer. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 7th)</p>
<h3>This City's Four Organizations Welcome Consultant Ogura: A Warm Tea Party Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on official business a few days ago. Four organizations, including the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Federation, held a tea party at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association's hall in the Great East Asia Building outside the [city center] at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 28th) to express their welcome.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The guests of honor, Consultant Ogura, as well as Consultants Aramaki and Uyama, arrived on time. The guests included President Liang, Minister Ding, Vice Minister Wu, Secretary-General Wu, Deputy Director Watanabe, Deputy Director Su, Director Yuan, Director Sun, Director Feng, Section Chief Sun, and Consul Nakata. The members of the four organizations included Chairman Funatsu, Aoki, Takeuchi, Muto, Jia Ben, Akamatsu, Hidaka, Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan [Deng], Zhao Jinqing, Ye Fu, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Boyuan, [Nan], Ding Fubao, Shao Shuhua, Wang Hai, Wang Shushen, Chen Riping, Chen Shaogui, Xu Jianping, Wang Huailian, Jin Zongcheng, Yao Junzhi, Lei Yuzhi, Shen Shuyu, Bao Guochang, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Yang [Lang], [Bao] Heng, Ling Da [ ], [Yu] Yu, Zhang Weiru, Tong Lvqing, Song Zhuozai, Liu Yunfang, Ren Yunpeng, and over two hundred others, making the atmosphere exceptionally warm. Wen Lanting, representing the Citizens' Welfare Association, Funatsu, representing the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Lin Kanghou, representing the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and Moriyama, representing the Press Federation, formed the presidium. First, Chairman Wen delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech by President Chen of this newspaper. Consultant Ogura then gave a reply, expressing his determination to cooperate in China's economic construction in the future. The party ended in a happy atmosphere at 6:00 p.m. The speeches are summarized below:</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Lanting's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Lanting said, "Mr. Ogura is an authority in the economic circles of our allied nation Japan, with extensive knowledge and rich experience. He visited China thirty years ago to inspect relief efforts and has been a friend of China ever since. This time, he has been appointed as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, and he will surely use his knowledge and experience to dedicate himself to China's wartime economic construction and to the economic cooperation between China and Japan. His talks with the economic circles and reporters in Shanghai further prove his deep observations and accurate insights. Today, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Federation are holding a tea party here to express our welcome and respect. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Chen Binqing to deliver a speech on behalf of us."</p>
<p>Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper</p>
<p>When Mr. Ogura met with the Chinese reporter group in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, he made a speech that we very much agreed with in many respects. Mr. Ogura said, "The revival of Shanghai's economy is indeed one of the most important tasks in China's economy today. Considering the importance of Shanghai's economy, I plan to come to Shanghai more often in the future to have sincere talks with the local economic circles." Standing in the position of Shanghai's economic circles, we feel particularly interested in this.</p>
<p>Mr. Ogura said, "The most important issue in China's economy is how to transform China's human resources into combat power and how to stabilize people's lives." Originally, any country participating in the war should fully achieve these two points. Our allied nation Japan is an excellent example. It has mobilized the nation's human resources to increase various productions, especially aircraft production, and agricultural production has been consistent with the goal of combat power. And prices are low, almost the same as usual. Although life is hard, it is very balanced, so people's lives are quite stable. This can be seen in the allied newspapers. Anyone who has been to Japan can see it with their own eyes. China is also a participating country, but it is very ashamed that human resources are still being wasted and have not yet been coordinated into combat power, while prices are soaring, production is shrinking, and people's lives are not stable. For example, the morbid state of industrial production in Central China: the organization is scattered, the operating rate of large factories is decreasing day by day, and production is decreasing day by day. Due to the lack of concentrated production, technological degradation, poor management, and poor control, the raw material consumption rate has increased, and the quality of products has gradually shown a tendency to cut corners and decline. It fundamentally violates the spirit of focusing on key points, and general industries have shrunk. The textile industry was originally the largest industry, but the current shrinkage of the textile industry is probably worse than any other industry. Secondly, regarding agricultural production, according to a survey by the Chinese Economic Research Association, in Songjiang and Qingpu, the three crops of grain, rapeseed, and wheat planted last year all suffered losses. Planting grain costs 70 yuan per acre, planting wheat costs 154 yuan per acre, and planting rapeseed costs 104 yuan per acre. Also, regarding the soaring rice prices that are leading the price increase, farmers are unwilling to sell in large quantities due to excessively low purchase prices. Purchasing agencies cheat, and the distribution cannot be improved, so black market prices jump. After the rice price rises, all wage costs increase accordingly, and thus general prices also rise sharply.</p>
<p>According to common sense, the [occupied] area is the richest area in terms of resources and should not have the above-mentioned phenomenon. Therefore, we have always believed that the root cause lies in the fact that politics are not on the right track and personnel are not sound. We have always maintained that the crisis of China's economic problems cannot be saved by economic measures alone, but must be combined with the strength of governance and should go hand in hand with the innovation of politics. Mr. Ogura also said, "Each country has different national conditions, so we will carefully review the policies to find the most effective method. For example, the method of controlled economy is not immutable and must vary according to the environment. As far as China is concerned, China has its own inherent folk customs and legends, so the control method must be completely suitable for it and then analyzed objectively. If not, the stricter the control, the more scarce the materials will become, which is contrary to the original intention of control. Therefore, we will study the reasons for past failures in controlled economy and hope to correct past mistakes in order to improve." This is the most rational judgment and an observation that hits the nail on the head. While admiring Mr. Ogura's outstanding insight, we are especially fortunate that the future of China's economy may have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Mr. Ogura is worthy of being a famous doctor with both knowledge and experience. In the past, the pathological condition of China's economy could not be improved, and both the patient and the doctor were responsible. Now it is extremely fortunate to have hired this famous doctor. Now that the diagnosis has been made, the proposed diagnostic plan is very accurate. Based on this plan, a good prescription will definitely be formulated to treat the condition. If the patient cannot listen to the doctor's guidance and take the medicine, and thus it does not benefit their health, it is of course the patient's responsibility, but the doctor, with the grand aspiration of serving the patient, often does not hesitate to be annoyed and is responsible for advising, so as to make the patient accept the treatment. At the same time, the patient should especially be self-disciplined and obedient to the doctor's instructions in order to restore their health.</p>
<p>Consultant Ogura's Reply</p>
<p>Consultant Ogura then gave a reply, saying: "I was recently appointed as the Supreme Advisor to the National Economic Committee of the National Government. After taking office, I came to Shanghai to visit various circles. I am very grateful to the four most powerful organizations in China, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Press Federation, and the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, for jointly holding a grand tea party to welcome me. Recalling that in July of last year, I came to Shanghai as the head of the Sino-Japanese Goodwill Civil Economic Delegation, and I received various teachings from you at that time. Therefore, I would like to express my infinite respect and gratitude for your kindness and hospitality. The significance of my coming to Shanghai last year was that the National Government of your country declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of last year, indicating its cooperation with Japan to advance toward the destruction of Britain and the United States. The Japanese government also adopted measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, gradually implementing the so-called new policy toward China. After the thorough implementation of this new policy toward China, the Chinese economic circles gradually understood Japan's true intentions and further joined hands with the Japanese relief circles. I came to your country with Mr. Akashi and Mr. Kodera to inspect the economic situation in China and to have sincere and open exchanges of opinions with the Chinese economic circles and government officials, in order to promote the psychological harmony between the economic circles of the two countries and to contribute to the practical cooperation between the economies of the two countries. This time, I feel infinite shame and honor in taking office as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government. When the National Government hired me, I felt that I was too old and not suitable for the job, so I politely declined, but I finally accepted due to the enthusiasm of the government and the public of your country. I am well aware that the duties of the Supreme Economic Advisor are heavy, and I am afraid that I will not be able to achieve satisfactory results for you. In the future, I will do my best to encourage myself and work diligently, hoping that you will often give me full guidance and assistance.</p>
<p>I believe that the relationship between China and Japan is not one of opposition, and that the two countries should coexist and prosper together. To do our best for China is to do our best for Japan. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of your country, once said: "Without Japan, there would be no China." I firmly believe in this statement. Cooperating with Japan from China's standpoint will completely benefit China. For example, striving for the stability of Chinese people's livelihood and the revitalization of China's economy can strengthen Japan's combat power, so Japan can win the war and complete the construction of Great East Asia. Regarding this point, Mr. Aramaki, the director of the Bank of Japan, who came to your country with me to take office as the Chief Economic Advisor of the National Government, also has the same feelings. As for the operation of China's economy, I believe that, in principle, it must be based on the creativity and responsibility of Chinese economists and the leaders of the National Government, and be promoted independently. I will have sincere talks with the officials of the National Government, not to mention with the Chinese economists, and do my best to assist China. But I will always stand on the sidelines and work hard. Regarding the psychological harmony between Chinese and Japanese economists, I have done my best in Japan in the past, and I am prepared to do even more this time. Based on this view, I plan to reside in Shanghai permanently in order to exchange opinions with various circles. Because the implementation of the new policy is still in a transitional period, misunderstandings can easily occur between the economic circles of the two countries. Therefore, I hope that the economic circles of the two countries will understand each other in the future, and so-called put aside petty differences for the sake of the greater good, and I also intend to do my best in this regard. Regarding the economies of China and Japan, I believe that it is necessary to supplement each other's deficiencies in order to achieve perfection. China is vast and rich in resources, and Japan's technology and industrial power rely on and help each other, which is a natural principle and the foundation for the prosperity of East Asia. We should cooperate with each other in the spirit of the alliance treaty to enhance combat power and stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people, and do our best. But in order to enhance combat power, I believe that the revitalization of Shanghai's economy is the most urgent task at present. Therefore, I hope that you will make further efforts. After the abolition of the concessions, under the complete sovereignty, Shanghai, freed from the shackles of Britain and the United States, will have a new look and become Shanghai of China. This is not only for China, but also for the entire Great East Asian nation to celebrate together. Regarding the future of Shanghai, although there are various opinions, I believe that it will continue to be the center of Chinese industry and commerce for a long time. I will do my best for this important Shanghai, and work hard for the revitalization and development of Shanghai's economy.</p>
<p>Just now, I was instructed by the host on various methods of dealing with China's economic problems, and I have understood various meanings very well. I was originally an outsider and have always paid attention to practical results in my work. As long as there are practical results, I will not hesitate to do it even if it is difficult and complicated. However, I am an ordinary person, so I can only do ordinary things. I am really unworthy of the host's praise. But in the future, if there are effective opinions from all sides, I will do my best to repay you.</p>
<p>Finally, I am very grateful and honored for your grand tea party and for the opportunity to meet with dignitaries from all walks of life in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Remarks by Consultant Ogura at the Welcome Tea Party</p>
<h3>The Third East Asian Medical Congress Concluded Solemnly Yesterday: The Next Congress Will Be Held in Manchukuo</h3>
<p>The Third East Asian Medical Congress, which brought together medical authorities from China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, Myanmar, and Africa, concluded yesterday, the last day, after completing lectures in various groups and holding a comprehensive discussion report, successfully completing a bright and brilliant page in the history of East Asian medicine.</p>
<p>Special Lectures</p>
<p>At 9:30 a.m., Chairman Miyakawa Yoneji introduced Kobayashi Harujiro of Keijo Imperial University of Korea to give a lecture on "Paragonimiasis in Korea." At 2:30 p.m., Chairman Lieutenant General Momoi introduced Takahashi Nobukichi of Taipei Imperial University of Japan to give a lecture on "Tropical Skin Diseases Associated with [ ]." After the lectures, a comprehensive report of the subcommittee was held, with a brief comprehensive discussion report on the results discussed by the three subcommittees in the previous two days. The report was divided into tuberculosis group, leprosy group, acute infectious disease prevention group, malaria group, kala-azar group, and filarial worm group, with each group reporting for about ten minutes until the report ended at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>Delegates from various countries to the Congress then held a solemn closing ceremony in the main auditorium. President Chu Minyi delivered a closing speech, saying: "For the past three days, I have been listening to your profound lectures. I feel that the principles of academics are infinite, and the more we study, the more truth we discover. Let us work together from now on, be brave and diligent, and the future of the medical community will definitely be bright and brilliant. This time, the gains are indeed very rich. The Association is very grateful for your hard work. Now that the Congress has successfully concluded, I respectfully announce the closing of the meeting." He then said that the cadre meeting held in Nanjing decided that the fourth Congress would be held in Manchuria next time. Subsequently, Uemura Hidekazu, the leader of the Manchukuo delegation, delivered a speech, saying: "At the joint meeting of the delegation members of various countries at the Third Medical Congress, it was decided to hold the conference in our country next year. I, in the capacity of the Acting Minister of the Manchukuo Department, express my heartfelt welcome."</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Mayor Chen held a grand banquet at the Capital Hotel at 12:00 noon yesterday to entertain all the delegates attending the Medical Congress. Those present included Mayor Chen, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Director of the Health Administration Lu Runzhi, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Wu Songju, and heads of various bureaus and departments. On the Allied side, there were Lieutenant General [ ], President of the East Asian Medical Association Hayashi Haruo, Secretary-General of the East Asian Medical Association Miyakawa Yoneji, and representatives from China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Annam, totaling no less than two hundred people. During the banquet, Mayor Chen delivered a speech, saying: "The Third East Asian Medical Congress was inaugurated in the midst of the Great East Asian War, bringing together representatives from seven countries, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, to conduct medical research and communication, which will inevitably make great contributions to the future of East Asian medicine. The academic achievements will become another manifestation of the sincere integration of East Asian nations. I feel exceptionally pleased to be able to gather with you today. The East Asian Medical Congress is the only international academic organization within the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although it has only been established for a short three years, with the gradual progress of the spiritual unity of the East Asian nations and with the gradual retreat of the forces of British and American imperialists in East Asia, the affairs of the East Asian Medical Association are also developing and expanding day by day. This is all achieved through your efforts and is the result of your mutual [ ], mutual research, and discussion. The health of the East Asian nations will be guaranteed through your efforts, and the unity of the East Asian nations will be even closer due to the spirit of your collective research, becoming one mind with ten billion people, and East Asia as one. Today, when the Great East Asian War is approaching the decisive stage, all the representatives have been able to come from afar despite their hardships, and from a purely academic and scientific standpoint, have made collective explorations and researches on the medical and pharmaceutical sciences urgently needed during wartime. This shows that all of you are willing to make due efforts for the current war. This spirit, I believe, will also be expanded by you, guiding the one billion people of East Asia to rise up together and strive for the completion of the war. In China, it is no secret that scientific medicine and hygiene are still in an unsatisfactory state. The public academic lectures made by the medical communities of various countries in Shanghai this time, all the topics involved are needed by us and are of particular concern to us. I believe that it will definitely inspire the determination of our country's medical community to research and progress, and to [ ] together, in order to make a contribution to the future of East Asian medicine. Here, I would like to express my respect and gratitude to you. Finally, I wish the East Asian Medical Association a bright future, wish your efforts to achieve the most valuable results, and wish the East Asian nations to complete their liberation as soon as possible. I believe that a healthy East Asia will be produced due to your efforts. "</p>

<h3>Nanyang Hospital: Benefiting Elementary School Teachers with Free Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Measures</h3>
<p>Nanyang Hospital Director Mr. Nan states: "Regarding the current situation, Nanyang Hospital recognizes the great responsibility towards elementary school teachers. Their lives are hard, and we have long sympathized with them. Because they spend their days with chalk, breathing in chalk dust, and often hunched over grading papers, they are often depressed and lonely. It is truly pitiful when they contract tuberculosis. Nanyang Hospital considers medicine as a service to society and should strive to do its best to help teachers overcome this difficulty. Given the recent prevalence of tuberculosis in the education sector, we have formulated a temporary plan for free tuberculosis prevention and treatment at our hospital for the benefit of all. Sincerely, Gu Nanqun, Director of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital."</p>

<h3>Charity for Children Association Fundraising: Ending Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The current fundraising campaign of the China Charity for Children Association is scheduled to end on April 30th. The work has been intensive in recent days. Currently, over 1.66 million yuan has been received in donations, still 340,000 yuan short of the target. All staff members are actively promoting the campaign in all sectors, hoping to reach the target before the end of this month. This week, the association received a total of 159,150 yuan in donations, including 23,400 yuan from Han Shoushan, 13,000 yuan from Dong Ganwen, 11,800 yuan from Damo Foreign Firm, 12,000 yuan each from Pan Sanxing and Hongji continued donations, and 10,000 yuan each from Xiang Limin and Zhou Yixing. To date, a total of 1.663 million,342 yuan has been received. Yesterday, the association received a donation of a seven-pound hot water bottle produced by Lixing Great Wall Brand Hot Water Bottle Factory, designated as a gift for the largest donor of this campaign, to be kept as a souvenir. Currently, the largest donor is Mrs. Yiwo Zhaifu with 100,000 yuan, followed by Mrs. Yang Pengnian with 72,900 yuan, and then Qi Huichang with 66,000 yuan.</p>

<p>— Authored by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Asura (1)</p>
<p>1938— the year before the scout went to Honolulu.</p>
<p>Near Koenji Station in the new urban area of Tokyo. There is a street filled with cafes and restaurants. In a secluded place, a restaurant with the words "Roasted Chicken" written on the door, two people are drinking across from each other.</p>
<p>It seems neither of them can drink much, because on the table where the paint has already peeled off, there are only two small wine bottles, but a lot of roasted chicken bones are piled in the saucer.</p>
<p>The autumn night lamp seems a bit cold, emitting oily smoke. When a streetcar passes by, the floor trembles and shakes. It is that kind of small shop.</p>
<p>"What you say is doubting the essence of beauty." The man who said this is wearing a then-popular suit with edging, and a black shirt underneath, so he looks like a big director in a movie, but in reality, he is Mr. Tsuruhara, a fairly famous painter near the Nikakai.</p>
<p>"Is that so? However, I..." Speaking in a very low and melancholic voice, not refuting the other party's words, but as he speaks, he brushes the long hair that has fallen on his forehead to the top of his head with his hand, and stares at the table with his glasses. This other young man's voice is very young, but his face looks like he's twenty-four or twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>He temporarily hides his jaw inside the faded twill collar, and then starts speaking in a weak voice again.</p>
<p>"However, I... although I'm not saying the apple in the book isn't beautiful, although Cezanne's (1839-1906, French Impressionist painter - translator) apple in the book is beautiful everywhere, I myself don't have the aspiration to draw an apple."</p>
<p>"Don't say such contradictory things. You say Cezanne's apple in the book is beautiful, which proves that you have an understanding of the beauty of still life. So why don't you have the aspiration to paint? What is the reason?" Tsuruhara says this very directly.</p>
<p>"Alas, I don't understand this myself." Although the young man's answer is very vague, it doesn't seem like he's lying.</p>
<p>"You, you don't hate still life, do you!" Tsuruhara says this with a little emotion mixed in. This is because he himself is a still life painter who likes to paint flowers, fruits, pots, etc., like a popular French painter.</p>
<p>"I definitely don't hate it. I just don't want to paint it. It's not just about still life. To be honest, I'm not interested in the human body either. I'm not particularly interested in landscapes either."</p>
<h3>In Memory of Madam Huang Tai: Mr. Ji's Establishment of Weiyun Girls' Secondary School - An Example of Dedicating Funeral Expenses to Education</h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Ji Runmo of Shanghai Huiyuan Bank: "Regarding the matter that my late mother, Madam Huang Tai, passed away on April 2nd of this year in her hometown of Chongming. The forty-ninth day memorial is approaching in the blink of an eye. My late mother's dying wish was that there should be no mourning and no obituary should be issued. I, Runmo, respectfully follow the will of my late mother and dare not disobey. Looking around at the current situation, I am filled with regret. Therefore, with the agreement of my father and others, I am establishing Weiyun Girls' Primary and Secondary School in my hometown. Relying on my father's experience and will of devoting himself to education for more than twenty years, I sincerely hope to do my best for society. We will continue the unfinished ambition of my late mother and use the money saved from funeral arrangements and mourning expenses, as well as the money donated by relatives and friends on the day of the funeral, for educational purposes. In this way, we can transform wasteful consumption into beneficial construction and turn temporary extravagance into a lasting memorial. Then the soul of my late mother can rest in peace, and our feelings of shame can be lessened. I believe that Shanghai's extravagant habits are the worst in the country. All kinds of celebrations, banquets, and mourning events are extravagant and showy, demonstrating wealth. This prevailing custom not only invisibly consumes material resources, but also drastically changes the atmosphere. I, Runmo, am not intelligent, and I dare not be the only sober one when everyone else is drunk. However, given the difficulties of the times, I have the idea of establishing Weiyun Girls' Primary and Secondary School in memory of my late mother. If I can make my humble intentions public through the newspapers, so that relatives and friends are widely informed and the prevailing customs are corrected, then I will be endlessly grateful. Sincerely, Ji Runmo, April 27th."</p>
<h3>Anatomy Classroom Fees: Response from the School</h3>
<p>Regarding Mr. Wu Guangxin's letter of the 27th, "Should Students' Parents Pay Anatomy Classroom Fees?" There are some discrepancies with the facts, so we dare to clarify a few points as follows:</p>
<p>The letter states: "Must be paid within ten days, otherwise, you will not be allowed to participate in the exam," but it is unclear whether this is based on a school announcement or just casually written, which is unfair. The reason for collecting the Fuxing Anatomy Classroom fee this time is a suggestion from the student representatives of each grade, and the school is only adopting their opinions. After the school decided to collect the fees, it had already considered the family situation of each student. For those who are indeed poor, there is a separate remedy. This was stated in advance. (Omitted below). Southeast Medical College</p>
<h3>Soliciting Donations from All Sectors to Help the Poor</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of this office and the undertaking of social welfare initiatives, we have been deeply grateful for the unwavering support from all sectors. Currently, due to a sharp increase in the number of applications for assistance, the need for funds is growing. We hope that enthusiastic individuals will generously donate to benefit others and themselves, accumulating immeasurable merit. The services provided by this office include the following six types:</p>
<p>Scholarships for Students　　Poverty Relief Funds</p>
<p>Medical Aid Funds　　Elderly Assistance Funds</p>
<p>Childbirth Assistance Funds　　Small Business Funds</p>
