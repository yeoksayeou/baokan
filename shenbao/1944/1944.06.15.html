<h3>希望和熱誠</h3>
<p>合羣是人類生存的天則，互助是達到合羣的方法，我們始終認定，假如中國國民個個能夠互助，能夠合羣，中國國事立即可以走上積極振作的途徑。</p>
<p>就以助學運動一件事而言。讀者諸君和我們心裏都有一個希望，希望下一代的中華民國國民個個要勝過我們這一代，然後下一代中華民國的國運方有光明的前途，所以培植下一代的國民，是目前最重要的工作。這件事本是政府的責任，但在國家還沒有能力，通盤籌劃的時候，社會人士，責無旁貸，理應通力合作，用社會的力量，促其成功。這是共同的信念，共同的希望，而助學運動就是由這個共同信念所產生的其同工作，這件工作是拿讀者們和我們的滿腔熱誠來進行着，數年如一日地，一屆又一屆的努力。</p>
<p>因為有希望，有熱誠，所以我們不怕任何困難，竭力奮鬬。在我們辦理助學事務的時候，我們竟也想不到困難，或不可能的事。求助人數逐屆增多，學費金額逐期增加，而社會經濟却漸趨衰落，客觀的事實在在足以使一般人心餒，可是我們主觀的心理只是教我們勇進直前。我們認定，社會上沒有難事，社會上沒有不可能的事，假如你心裹先存着一個困難和不可能的心思，那末，任何事情都是困難和不可能了。所以，客觀的事實決不能阻正我們的進行，他只是教導我們需要加倍的努力，加倍的奮鬬。</p>
<p>我們為什麼有迨樣大的勇氣？因為我們有希望，有熱誠，同時最最重要的，還是因為這是讀者們共同的希望，有讀者們共同的熱誠來做後盾。讀者諸君個個都自願地至少為這件工作予以一臂之助，集合十萬個讀者們的『一臂之助』，這僩力量還不夠偉大嗎？衆志成城，衆擊易舉，事業那有不成功的道理。</p>
<p>試想一想，數年或十數年後，受助的學生們一個一個的學成了，某入在社會某方面服務，某人替國家在某部份出力，某人在學術上有了地位，某人創造了某件事業，受助學生都成了社會國家有用的人才。飲水思源，都要感謝申報讀者們的幫助。巾報的讀者們回想起那時候贊助助學運動的熱誠，親手所培植的種子，居然開了花，結了果，精神上的愉快還有比這個更高更大的嗎？而本報同人等，回想常年追隨讀者諸君之後，勉力工作，使這件事居然能夠有極大的成功，軍感覺到無限的光榮。</p>

<h3>適應決戰現階段　調整商統會機構　國府特派聞蘭亭任理事長</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　戰時下證制負有全國商業統制運營重任之全國商業統制總會成立以來，瞬屆一年。在此一年中。該會對於戰時統制經濟之初步工作，如各業統制機構之確立，各項統制法規之釐訂，以及農工物資之統一運銷收配等均已奠定基礎。茲以當局為適應決戰階段起見，該會之機稱業務職權等等，更有進一步強化之必要。爰經關係各方面之商討，業已獲得具體方案，日內即可正式發表。惟原任理事長唐壽民氏深感於今後工作之更為繁重，恐有隕越，爰懇辭職。政府當局以唐氏辭意懇切，故於日昨正式明令特派聞蘭亭氏繼任理事長。按聞氏原任該會監事長，今繼唐氏而任理事長，更能發抒其抱負，而為我統制經濟傾其全力。深信今後統制經濟前途，定能因此次機構之調整，而愈趨合理。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電「國民政府命令，六月十四日。全國商業統制總會理事長唐壽民呈請辭職，唐壽民准免本職，此令。又令，特派聞蘭亭為全國商業統制總會理事長，此令。主席汪兆銘，兼行政院長汪兆銘」。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　隷屬全國商業統制總會之粉麥專業委員會，不日改組，將專業二字改為統制二字，以符名實，定為全國商業統制總會粉麥統制委員會。特派孫仲立為主任委員，已由行政院令飭運照，并呈請國民政府備案，曁將該會組織規則明令公佈。</p>
<h3>日軍對長沙三面包圍中潼關已受日軍威脅</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電據美聯社重慶訪員訊，長沙方面戰況如次：據渝軍前綫報吿稱，日軍已由東南北三方面，將長沙包圍，刻正於長沙北方郊外之撈刀河畔，展開正面攻擊。同時並進攻長沙東南七公里，瀏陽河畔之東山。按此次日軍係由長沙東部郊外採取包團形勢，同時繞至南部郊外進攻渝軍。又日機為協力地上部隊作戰，亦極活躍，料長沙之命遝，近數日內當可決定。</p>
<p>里斯木十四日中央社電據合衆社重慶訪員十三日訊，渝軍戰況如次：日軍刻正進攻閣鄉（隴海綫要衝，潼關東方三十二公里。）中國西北門之偉關所受之威脅，已愈加重云。</p>
<p>渝軍委會發表戰况</p>
<p>里斯本十四日巾央社電據重慶電，渝軍委會十三日晚間發表：　湖南戰錢，長沙外圍防錢戰事仍熾，長沙東部日軍，十二日分若干集團，企圖渡過瀏陽河，其中一部向西移動，欲強行渡過湘江，渝軍對此，特加迎擊</p>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電據重慶電，渝軍事委員會十三日發表，刻日軍向益陽（洞庭湖南岸要衝）進攻中，已於十二日正午突入該市東門，正展開巷戰中。</p>
<p>美機隊襲武漢郊外</p>
<p>漢口十四日中央社電駐渝美空軍曾於十三日上午九時三十分，以戰鬥轟炸機聯合絹隊，約三十三架，空襲武漢，濫向郊外及水田投彈。經日軍地上砲火邀擊後，旋即逸去。此次敵機向水田投彈，會炸死炸傷耕作中之農民若千人，並會予農作物以若千損書。十一日午前十一時四十分，敵戰鬥機七架之編隊來襲安慶，經該地日駐軍猛烈射擊，擊落其三架（其中一架未證實，）日方損害極輕微</p>
<p>日機襲建甌美機塲</p>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電日機隊十三日下午二時廿分，　擊駐渝美空軍前綫基地建甄，轟炸其滑行路及機塲附近之十數處兵營，使其悉數被摧毀，不能使用，日機則安返基地。</p>
<p>渝師長呂公良陣亡</p>
<p>鄭州十四日中央社電河南作戰中最激烈者，為許昌會戰，當時被湯恩伯飭令死守許昌之暫編第廿九師長呂公良，曾三度發電請求救援。首次之電報謂，今許昌巳岌岌可危，次謂若援軍不到，我等恐難死守。最後則謂，我等已決守與該城共存亡，卒至衆寡不敵，壯烈陣亡。茲日軍某部隊以呂氏精神，令人感佩，特於許昌城內建立紀念碑，以慰呂氏在天之靈，又對於呂氏遣族，亦決予保獲。</p>
<h3>日改良土地收獲成果</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日第二次食糧增產對策中之土地改良事業，自去年秋季即在日本各地農村展開，該項改良東業已於本年五月底完成去年冬季之計劃。日農商省為此，特於十三。四日分別在戰時食糧增產推進中央木部參與會及該會顧問會議席上，說明過去推行之士地改良事業所獲成果。並於即日發表土地改良事業俺要如次：由五月底迄現在止，全國之促進率，與去年冬季之事業計劃比較，已突破預定計劃之百分之一零四，再就都道府縣別而觀，除一部地方外，其餘各地並突破百分之百，其中亦有一部地方，在去年冬季期內一舉而完成五年至十年間之改良事業，由此而觀，四億一千七百四十四萬八千餘元之巨額事業費，今已能撥入土地改良事業使用，而達成劃期之改良計劃。同時，由於上述各項事業計劃之完成，木年度米之收獲量，將可增收一百八十萬石左右，至預定於明年收獲之麥類，亦將可增收一百十二萬五千石。</p>
<h3>淺海少將視察陸軍將校團</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　軍事委員會高級顧問漢海少將，昨晨赴中央陸軍將校訓綀團視察，由該團教育長蕭叔宣舉行介紹式，懇談良久。旋至高府班幹部隊各講堂宿舍等處巡視，均有良好印象。</p>
<h3>高木副總裁　論中日提携　兩國應確立領導地位</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　中日寶業公司副總裁高木陸期氏，為日本「中國通」中有數人物，十三日氏於此問接見記者，反駁對「中日提攜不可能」之論調，大意謂，余友陳友仁，昔曾懷疑中日提攜之傎實實現謂：「傎正提攜，非以互惠為基礎，則絕無傎正提攜存在之可能，依目下中日兩國實際情形觀之，日本僅自中國有所收獲，對中國則無何貢獻，故頗難實現眞正之中日提攜」云，於茲吾人亦不能否認。過去日木確曾持有儸見，但自大東亞戰爭發生後，極有開拓新勢力圈之必要，故日木為無必要目向人口稠密之中國大陸進攻，日本對南方未開發之天地，需要甚大力量開發，絕無武力征服中國大陸之必要，於是，日本對華新政策際此時機應運而生。而中國今日需要南方供給者實多，如油脂·米·橡皮及糖等，則必需仰賴日本為之仲介不可，陳友仁氏之所謂片面提攜，於茲已一變為互惠之提攜矣。綜合中日兩國客觀情勢，深信兩國眞正提攜必能實現而不疑，大東亞戰爭已進而為亞細亞洲人解放之聖戰。巾華民族乃亞洲最最大民族，日人實有與之協刀必要，中日兩國非團結一致，則大東戰爭不能早日完遂，中日兩國必須在世界新秩序中，確立指導地位。</p>
<p>實業部次長　姜佐宣返京</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　實業部次長姜佐宣氏，前此因公赴滬，於日前返京。記者特叩詢此次赴滬經過，當承對記者所提問題一一答復如下：（問）調整上海各工廠現况如何？（答）調整工廠，以集中生產為原則，現木部對於肥皂。火柴。洋燭。三種，已與多方聯絡妥當，其具體方法，雖已商討確定，惟尙須經院會通過，始克實施。（問）對於滬市工商業有否其他改善計　？（答）對於滬工商業改善計劃，現已由工商設計委員進行調查工作，視各公司內容如何，再為着手進行改善。</p>
<p>蘇敎廳派員　視察鎭江敎育</p>
<p>鎭江十四日中央社電　省敎資廳為明瞭鎭江敎育實施狀况，特派主任　學吳鶴　等到鎭視察，已於十日抵鎭，分往各校及社敎機關視察，甚表滿意。</p>
<h3>必阿克敵陣地　遭猛烈轟炸並有巡洋艦二艘被毀</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　西南太平洋前綫基地電，日機隊曾於十二日上午猛炸必阿克鳥附近之敵艦船，炸毀敵巡洋艦二艘，是役日機五架未飛返。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電，日空軍為協力必阿克島方面日陸上部隊作戰，會於十二日黎明轟炸必阿克島方而敵軍陣地，確見敵地六處被炸起火，日機已全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>日軍佔領哥卡丹　向比先波爾突進　幹綫急進隊猛攻寗索崑</h3>
<p>印度前綫十三日中央社電日軍各精銳部隊，前會蹂躪撒特北方敵陣（比先波爾西南十公里），七日急襲敵重炮測量陣地（庫維莫爾北方比先波爾西南約入公里），將之完全佔領，日兵團主力關入撤特北方一帶，敵兵千除妨害日電反攻，繼續頑強抵抗，日軍則施以猛攻，終將之擊潰，佔領庫維莫爾北方高地，當獲得攻擊此先波爾之有力基地，日軍各部隊是日更以夜襲，突破庫維莫爾東方陣地，奪佔該陣地附近敵軍據點，入日晟佔領哥卡丹（比先波爾西南八公里）。一方由幹綫上急進之部隊，亦於七日晨突入要衝波薩哈姆，將之完全佔領，更行反轉與北上部隊相呼應，猛攻寗索崑（彼　哈姆南方五公里）附近之頑敵，將之擊潰，與幹綫西方突進部隊同時準備突進比先波爾，該方敵第二十三師及機甲部隊之戰意，因最近激戰疲勞，日行低下，過去雖屢次反覆來攻，然最近其反擊亦漸已微弱。</p>
<p>怒江方面劇戰</p>
<p>仰光十四日中央社電怒江方面已展開壯烈之殲滅戰，日軍各精銳部隊將　南遠征革主力誘至據點前予以殲滅，同時，渝軍補充舟艇已悉為擊沉於怒江之濁流中，其企圖己被粉碎，故目下僅恃駐渝美空軍補給綫之接濟，但因美國軍將校與渝軍發生傾軋，故空中補給亦時常中斷，加之指揮系統紊亂，其打通新細公路綫之計劃，已拋諸九宵雲外。現在日軍猛攻下，僅能茍延殘喘，雖稱裝備整齊之　南遠征軍，實則極為簡陋，由日軍收容之屍體及函獲兵器觀之，即不難窺見其貧弱情形。又此次　江作戰開始以來，截至十日，渝軍棄屍四七四零具，函獲迫擊炮十六門，輕重機槍五十五挺，步槍四二五枝，其他食糧彈藥甚多。</p>

<p>滬訊　軸心軍在歐洲張行登陸，一方在太平洋方面亦企圖打開行將停頓之戰時，尤其因新幾內亞西部戰況，未能依照預定計劃進展，大感焦灼，故在中部太平洋方面企圖進行牽制作戰，於十一日以來，突向中部太平洋馬里亞那羣島方面日軍據點，。據日大本營發表共擊毀敵機一百二十四架以上，予以重大損害。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，特於十四日就此點發表見解，並披瀝軸心軍東西呼　，擊滅敵方戰力之斷乎決意。茲　談話內容於次：敵方首腦部素主張於侵攻歐洲，同時應在太平洋方面採取攻勢，六月十一日敵有力部隊，果向我馬里亞那羣島突施攻擊，敵之作戰企圖，乃在誘致我方艦隊勢力，至敵力有利海面進行決戰，然帝國海軍部隊絕不為敵方策動所乘，始終依照既定方針，予以迎頭痛擊，收獲莫大戰果，業輕大本營詳細發表，然敵刀為掩飾敗績起見，竟將自身損害轉嫁於人，為稱擊落日機一百三十架云云，徒暴露敵方宜傳欺人之一斑，一方在西南太平洋方面別克島新幾內亞北岸之敵，這受日軍強壓，亦已漸失積極性，然敵方在太平洋方面，尚不能永久保持停頓狀態，且歡洲西部之上陸戰，既經發動，當不許輕易後退，故英美方面，對於東西戰綫必非同時傾注兵力不可，我日德二軍，對於敵方之此項行動，唯有始終誘致敵軍至自軍威力圈內，東西呼應予以徹底擊滅。</p>

<h3>中國青年之進路</h3>
<p>— 友松圓諦</p>
<p>本月六日在國立上海大學講</p>
<p>一個人的生活，是決定於其靑年之時代的。在和平時代度過靑年期的，和在戰爭與革命時代迎接着學生期的人，其一生的思想是會不同的。</p>
<p>諸君這數年來，在戰爭之間迎送了靑春的時代，大概是遭遇着許多的苦難的吧？中國的一部份人，到了今日大概還是會聞到戰爭之氣息的。戰爭是人生的不幸，它使許多貴重的人命和財產喪失。這件事實雖然大家知道，可是在這戰爭仍然進行着之中，諸君是不能不深深探求其原因的。這是一個靑年的意義和任務。</p>
<p>戰爭之思想的意味，是應該是有便它不至於實複發生之一種學的衝動的</p>
<p>中日兩國的戰爭，是兩國所抱着的對立思想，要從更大的文化飛躍到更高的綜合為前提的。中日兩國的文化，為達到道樣飛躍的綜合，自然需要這樣的犧牲。沒有這種戰爭的殘害，雖然能夠做到文化交流，但亞洲與世界的命運，却是不允許它如此的。人類民族的思想，只有從痛苦的經騐，才能淸算自己的獨斷。中日兩國，因此戰爭，指道了兩國彼此的長短得失，知道了中日兩國的命運之共同形態。使兩國至於以干戈相見者，乃「非亞細亞的人」，而是英美思想為其原因。這傎理是在非常犧牲之後明自了。我相信重慶的指導者也隨即會達到同一之認識的。</p>
<p>民國三十年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭終於因日木的果斷與勇氣而開始了。黃色民族對於英美這樣世界最大的兩國宣戰的前例，是在亞洲的歷史上所未曾見的。這次戰爭，顯名思義，在「大東亞思想」的發見與確立，有其極深的意義。那自然要從東亞的天地，把英美的政治的，經濟的貪慾，加以驅逐；但其實在於打破蠶食着東洋人思想的一種崇拜英美的務神。把幾世紀來迷信着西洋人為優秀的民族，東洋人為低級的民族這種錯誤的偏見，從大東亞加以剷除，是具有哲學之意義的。同時「大東亞」的各國家，名美該的共同意織，已在東洋精神的真理上，有完全握手之必要了。</p>
<p>中國的古典精神</p>
<p>我到這上海之後，曾問過一個大學生親：「你對中國稱讚它什麼呢？」但他却不曾給我明自的回答。雖然一面稱自己為「中華民國」，但中國人，尤其是靑年，對於自己的文化，却太沒有自信了。誇說說南京路的建築與街衢，和盛讚了教會大學的話，那不過只是讚美歐美而已。諸君究竟對於中國誇讚着什麽呢？無論說是五千年的文明史也好，說「地大物博」也好，但從現在的組織機構來說，那些勿寗是現出其相反的黑暗面。那麼，要我來代為答復嗎？我以為亘全東亞的諸地城，中國的古典精神，即在今日也還是生着的。孔孟的儒教思想，老莊的道教思想，以及自即度東傳繁榮於中國的佛教思想—這些中國的古典精神，今尚生者成為東洋理念而活動者。</p>
<p>靠日木的勇氣與自信發生的「大東亞戰爭」，並非為着日本一國的利害，而是以全東亞十億人的幸福為目的的。這戰爭之有廣大的意義，和中國在淸朝之前，在任何時代都是以全東亞為對象而思想而行動是一樣的。這不是單為中國的中國，而是為全東亞的中國。所以有「中國」這名稱的意義。然目明末以來，因歐美文明之輸入，中國便放棄其思想上之自主性了。中國各地不但被開了租借地和租界，連中國的思想也成為英美的殖民地，因此忘了中國的古典精神而　入於歐美的崇拜。於是中國的思想便卑下，和自屈了。使中國的「大東亞的中國」道種日木的捨身，是打開「大東亞戰爭」之眞正的意義。</p>
<p>民國冊二年一月九日，國民政府已注意到這深深的意義而對英美宣戰了，因此諸君已成為大東亞戰爭的戰友。日本的勝利，便是中國的勝利。然而諸君之中，也許有被英美宣傳的新聞所迷錯認了英美戰力，而懷疑日本之勝利的。這也不是無理的。但若如此，諸君就非戰友了。如果是戰友，就應該為日木躭心。應該加以忠吿和助力。並且應該有擊滅英美的義勇軍的組織。我對諸君的心情是了解的，然誇說以三個自可以打倒日本的這一次戰爭，却已經過二年半了。這次戰爭，看形勢是會十年對峙的吧。勝敗並只是靠者武器和兵力。以死殉國的精神是最後的勝利。「日木之不敗」，這是我在這裹能夠斷言的。必義如此，「大東亞」才能成就，這是大東亞戰爭的目的。</p>
<p>國民政府宣戰以來，如剛才所說那樣義勇軍的發動雖未聽見；但為助日本的戰力，已提供莫大的物登給日木了。已對於駐華的日本軍供給不少的糧麥了，這是應該感謝的。自然因此也許給與中國人以許多之困難的。然而中國能忍受這個苦難，便是一種參戰的證據，是一種戰友的義務。日本已自己垂範使各國的租界交還，更進一步協助中國之自主與獨立。中國的青年若當此為一種抽發財票的行為，那是大大底錯誤。沒有代價與犧牲，是不會有　主的。要脫卸幾世紀的半殖民地的性格，便是「這大東亞戰爭」。</p>
<p>今後十年的戰爭，　之以五十年間經濟戰與思想，必須勝利，中國的獨立自主，才能成立。日本是為這中國的自主進而提供其血肉的。</p>
<p>我不覺對於戰爭的意義與政治上的經偉說得太多了。這並不是我對中國青年多說了政治的話。為什麽呢？這是諸君過於想到政治去了。是因為諸君早熟的緣故啦。政治，如這字所表示的，是「以文而正」，才是真正的意義。對於年輕缺乏教養，國少經騐的人，該做什麼政治運動呢，政治是以「德」為本質的。由人格的德；自然會產生政治。不做長老的人，高尚的道德是不會精進的。中國的政治，不客氣地說，並不能說是好的。因為那是年輕的人們，用着招牌和宣傳的傳單，而做政治的。最好的傳單，是無需要紙的，所謂「為政不在多言」。是自已以好榜樣而示之於民的。於是民生，民權，才能順利的推進。</p>
<p>青年應埋首學問</p>
<p>自然，　君爲什麽熟心於政治，我是知道的。今日中國的事情，自然會把青年的諸君捲入於政治運動的。而且那　可以找到自己出身的機會。可我希望大家且等一等。青年們是無須早早就發跡的。青年們只有清貧才能事攻學問。我到三十歲為止也是未入社會而孜孜研究的。自然青年的心，對於政治的不滿與激昂是會發生的。這種良心，是靑年重要的花，但這花決不可以早採。所以應該抑制者　　的心情，埋頭於學窗。政治運動是要找到發跡之捷徑的。這樣一來好的中決難產生的。諸君如果要和在五十年後，建設眞正中國，目前應做的學問，與其研究政治，還是多學一些政治史和政治倫理來得重要，在教養程度極高的中國人材輩出時，新中國便產生起來了。</p>
<p>聽說中國的大學專攻政治與經濟的人很多，我曾微笑。因為這是很像日本的明治時代的。當時在明治維新之後，靑年們抱着風雲之志，想要逐鹿於中原。然而不久，這種風潮停止，靑年們便各各傾心於基礎的，實用的學問了。於是日本才能飛躍起來，才能誕生科學的日本，與技術的日木。中國靑年今後應從那一方面前進才好，這裹我是想加以忠舌的。政洽也好，經濟也好。但是想從畢業的第二大，馬上就要發跡這種浮淺的學問是不行的。應該要做一種基礎的，理論的，原理的學問才好。尤其是上海，因為是通商口岸，所以重商的思想特別濃厚。商業雖然重耍，但是今後亞洲是不能再做英美的市塲了。日本或中國，都不能不成為一個供給物品於亞洲全部市塲的工塲。（未完）（待續）</p>

<h3>中日佛教界人士　須團結一致　友松教授發表感想</h3>
<p>新聞報與本報主辦之戰時學術講座第二屆講師友松教授，即將分赴蘇。京及華北等地考察中國佛考察為憾。本人對貴國佛教界頗感興趣，發現固有特徽數點如下：　中國佛教界有極偉大之人物存在，無論就其人格或學問而言，此輩人物均為罕見。　中國之佛教頗有其特殊勢力，而與政府及軍隊不發生任何關係。　佛教頗得一般人民之信仰，因此人民與佛教信仰之關係里常密切。　佛教之修行道業非常認俱深刻，如坐禪等事，當有特殊之意義。　關於佛教之學問，其　團雖不為廣，然局部言之，均有非常深刻之研究，為世界所不可多得者。</p>
<p>以上均為中國佛教之優點，但亦不無缺陷之處。即　中國之佛教界，雖一之限制，而無全國統一之組織，希望今後能迅予組織統一之佛教團體。　佛學教育上之設備，不十分究備。　中國各地雖有寺廟，但尚無綜合的佛學院。　佛學之研究方法，各地均採取原始之固有方法，鮮有進步。　理論上之佛學派與實行上之修行派，尚未趨於聯絡合作之地步。</p>
<p>本人以日本佛學界之立場，率直陳述，余感覺今後中日兩國之佛教界，必須團結一致，互相聯絡，互相合作，至其協力之方法，可分為二：一為學問方面，二為事業方面。關於前者，中日兩國須交換佛界人士，如佛學者興僧士之互相交換，佛學研究之出版書籍之交流等，均為亟待實行者。關於後者，如社會事業，慈善事業等（如醫院，學校），中日兩國須在方法上，材料上，以及人物上互相協力交流，而種種社會事業，若有未發而需日本佛界援助者，日本可派遣有經驗之士，加以援助，同時更希望中國佛教界自身，亦能多熱心於慈善事業，如此不但可多得民心，且中日兩國更能因而互相協力，如是百年親善，自然可為。余深信中日兩大國民，若有同一信仰，兩國親善，決不為難也。」</p>
<p>佐佐木氏離滬返國</p>

<p>以上共收三萬六千五百元，述前共收五十八萬一千七百元。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>送佐佐木博士</h3>
<p>我們鑒於和平區內學術研究的空氣淡薄，由新聞報與木報聯合舉辦「戰時學術講座」，以期提高學術研究的興趣。第一次聘請盟邦日木農業專家佐佐木博士担任　師。博士於上月十八日來滬，今日離滬回國，歷時匝月，兼在上海·南京·杭州·蘇州等處舉行演講會，座談會，並參觀農業團體機關。在此期內，奔波勞苦，未暇休息。對於中國農業客方面給予很大的影響，這在中國農業增產聲中，是一樁足以欣幸的事。不僅為新聞報與木報兩報之幸，亦為全國農業之幸。</p>
<p>以言增加生產的主要工作，技術改進當然有此必要。據佐佐木博士所述，中口兩國農業畜牧生產的統計比較，舉例如次：</p>
<p>（註：牛乳一石等於中國二石。日本牛奶每日最高產　為世界最高紀錄。）</p>
<p>由此可見日本對於農業畜牧之技術改進，已收極佳的成效，我們應即迎頭趕上。可是，在中國的農村環境，欲求增加生產獲致實效，除謀技術改進之外，同時，還需政治改進，營如治安確立，廢除苛雜，而足以促使減產的因素，必須完全消滅。</p>
<p>我們深切感覺，中日提攜，在中國最需要者，就像佐佐木博士者輩，來華擔任切實指導的工作，使中國一般社會的陳舊現象，獲得切實的科學的改進，而　於現代化。這個觀點，我們早曾提出過，尤以這次佐佐木博士來華表示誠懇熟忱的態度，更使我們加強這個觀點，深盼關心兩國提攜者充分留意。</p>
<p>其次，佐佐木博士回國之前，特捐助本報及新聞報助學金各二千五百元。並謂歸國後將對巾國留日學生，盡其最大的教導責任，這種重視教育，熱忱教育的態度，尤使我們深為感動。</p>
<p>最後，承實業部及所屬農業機關，浙江省杭州市政府，及京滬杭各大學，　農業團體，專家等，均予極大協助，於此順便表示謝意。</p>

<h3>助學金籃球義賽　西靑勝中靑　各一和局明晚決賽</h3>
<p>本報助學金籃球賽第二幕，中靑西靑昨再度會師於中青健身房，觀眾較第一次決賽，更為擁擠，結果西靑以　九比十一凱旋，造成各一均等之局面，中西兩雄將於明晚八時正仍在原處決賽，賽前並將由上海健美男子比賽得獎者表演，以為養賽之插曲，將為明晚精彩節目之一。昨賽中靑以仁餘人馬出塲，雖有優良之表演，惜球運奇劣，致格格不入，而遭慘敗。茲將昨日戰情略記如下：</p>
<p>形勢變化</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生　志芳，八時正比賽開始，中靑聲勢煊赫，操主動地位，勃脫撞人返歸，林維聽一　中的，記錄首開，旋余郁子犯規，西靑扮成平手，奧柴　藍下拖入，馬　希回報顏色，余鬱子罰球命中，中靑以五比三領前。西靑呼停，張錦　入代李董和，西靑後　固若金湯，中青屢試中央突破，未克奏功，馬璨希單槍匹馬建立一功後，形勢突變，西靑反而取得主動地位，凱捷密洛夫，浮尼克一唱一和，耶龍錦上添花，上半時結東，西靑以十比七領前。</p>
<p>表演失常</p>
<p>休息再戰，　靑諸將同心　力，極　挽回狂瀾，奈天不從人，余郁子二區未中，凱捷密洛夫邊綫突進，居然中　，勃脫又於中綫遠射入藍，浮尼克滿場飛奔，進中三元，中靑漸形不濟，僅余郇子扳回二分，旋耶龍又於中靑籃下鶴子翻身撩進一隻，時間終了，西靑遂以二九比十一凱旋。中靑昨表演殊失常態，極多浪　，罰球十七次僅得五分，西靑昨後衛有優良之表演，其勝亦非倖致。</p>

<p>關於核發中請書數書，概以學生人數百分之之說明辦事處核發由請一五為度，除非第六屆受助人數已經超過此百分比，絕不通融。惟額外另發畢業生或轉學生之申請書，佔全數四之一，少數學校未明核算標準，以為一律照報名人數折扣發給，殊非事實。實際上有不少學校已自行嚴格限制，所開人數在規定限度內，辦事處如數發給，絕不折扣。更有學校誤將初小及幼稚園學生計算在內，結果當然大有出入，並非辦事處算術有誤。又日來辦事處人員忙於核發申請書，各校當局及家長學生希隨時注意本　消息，依照規定手續辦理一切，來函有所責問或要求，恕一一答覆。衛生展覽會祗有今日一天全日開放不收門票新亞藥廠在會塲內有特價品出售歡迎參觀　跑馬廠衛生展覽會之一角（新亞藥廠）</p>

<h3>股份有限公司　董監之責任問題</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>股份有限公司董事監察人之責權與任務，公司法中木有規定，毋待贅言。第以今日一般股份有限公司之董事監察人，大都董而不事，監而不察，徒居董監名義，不執行公司法所規定之責權與任務，其得爲董事監察業，或以公司借重其在社會之地位與名譽，俾易招募股款而徇情担任。或以認購公司股額爲條件，而自高其地位。或以代募股款，推　其子弟充當公司要職，為交換條件，而其子弟之才識之究能勝任與否，則初未顧及，其於公司之利害，更遑論焉。</p>
<p>查董事會居公司行政系統之目，公司中一應電大任務，係由股東選舉，董監事組織董監事實，決大之責任。倘不勝其任而濫　其間，每　集會之時，唯唯否否，人云亦云，放棄董監責欋，一惟董事長或總經理之意旨為意旨。　此公司之董事長或總經理賢明幹綫，則雖有此種形同虛設之董監事會，仍可以發達業務。反之，則大權旁落，當權者視公司如私產，視芾監事會如無物，不按規定日期召開董監會議。遇有重大業務，不向董監事會請示，造成獨裁之制，甚且弊寶業生，公司之前途必受到十分嚴重之影響，股東之血木必受　折，而於董監個人之名譽，亦足以連帶波及。故希望現在凡充公司童監事者，應注意木身之責權與任務之重要，勿自甘放棄，庶於公司前途，有莫大之裨益。</p>

<h3>預防麻瘋問題</h3>
<p>麻瘋病的起因，大都由麻瘋桿菌侵入的緣故，而侵入的途徑，往往在皮　破損處或鼻腔口眼等粘膜中，所以麻瘋是一種接　傳染症是無疑的。</p>
<p>公眾的預防法，莫如將病者收容於一處，使與一般健康的人完全隔離，所以麻瘋療養院的設立，實於一般社會及病　兩有裨益的辦法，此死如病者的團體與其染污的物品，最好予以澈底的　除。</p>
<p>個人的預防法，要以淸潔為第一義，鼠　蠅蚊本為傳佈的媒介，應竭力加以撲滅，特別重要的，即不與患者與其所用物直接接觸甲乙消毒及洗滌。</p>
<p>如發現有可以之點，即應就專門醫生檢騐，一經證實，即應入蔴瘋療養愈的希望，社會亦可免不驚異的傳染，中華麻瘋救齋會設有麻瘋療養院及麻瘋診所，如屬貧病可以完全免費療治，各界如欲問津或捐款，儘可致兩靜安寺路六一二弄五三號該會辦事處。</p>

<h3>Hope and Zeal</h3>
<p>Harmony is the natural law for human survival, and mutual assistance is the way to achieve harmony. We firmly believe that if every Chinese citizen can help each other and unite, China's national affairs can immediately embark on a path of positive revitalization.</p>
<p>Take the student aid movement as an example. Readers and we share a hope in our hearts: that the next generation of the Republic of China will surpass our generation, so that the future of the Republic of China will be bright. Therefore, cultivating the next generation of citizens is the most important task at present. This matter is originally the responsibility of the government, but when the country is not yet capable of planning comprehensively, people from all walks of life have an unshirkable responsibility to cooperate and use the power of society to promote its success. This is a common belief, a common hope, and the student aid movement is a common endeavor generated from this common belief, carried out with the full enthusiasm of readers and ourselves, persevering for years, one term after another.</p>
<p>Because we have hope and zeal, we are not afraid of any difficulties and strive to fight. When we handle student aid affairs, we never expect difficulties or impossibilities. The number of applicants increases term by term, the amount of tuition increases period by period, but the social economy gradually declines. Objective facts are enough to discourage the general public, but our subjective mentality only teaches us to move forward bravely. We believe that there is nothing difficult in society, and there is nothing impossible in society. If you have a mindset of difficulty and impossibility in your heart, then everything is difficult and impossible. Therefore, objective facts cannot stop our progress; they only teach us that we need to make more efforts and fight harder.</p>
<p>Why do we have such great courage? Because we have hope and zeal, and most importantly, because this is the common hope of the readers, and we have the common zeal of the readers as our backing. Each and every reader voluntarily lends a helping hand to this work. Is the power of gathering the 'helping hand' of hundreds of thousands of readers not great enough? With concerted efforts, success is easily achieved. How can a cause not succeed?</p>
<p>Just imagine, in a few years or more than ten years, the aided students will have completed their studies one by one. Someone will serve in a certain aspect of society, someone will contribute to the country in a certain part, someone will have a position in academia, and someone will create a certain career. The aided students will all become useful talents for the society and the country. When drinking water, think of the source, and thank the readers of Shen Bao for their help. When the readers of Shen Bao recall the enthusiasm for supporting the student aid movement at that time, the seeds they planted with their own hands have actually blossomed and borne fruit. Is there any spiritual joy higher and greater than this? And we, the colleagues of this newspaper, feel infinitely honored to recall that we have been following the readers and working hard to make this matter a great success.</p>
<h3>### Provisional Higher Examination Measures for This Year: Interview with Jiang Changji</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) After the 47th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Conference passed the provisional measures for the higher examination in the 33rd year, the reporter went to President Jiang of the Examination Yuan yesterday morning (14th) to inquire about the contents of the provisional higher examination measures for this year. I was received and the following remarks were made: The higher examination for the (33rd) year was originally scheduled to be held in October of this year, but under the current wartime system, the National Government has an urgent need for talent. Moreover, after the resumption of National Central University, the first class of students has graduated, and there are also many graduates from other parts of the country. In order to ensure the status of students after graduation, the National Government specially promulgated the provisional measures for the higher examination in the (33rd) year, and decided to advance the examination date to July 17th, 33rd year, to be held in the auditorium of this court in Nanjing. However, this year's higher examination is limited to the category of ordinary administrative personnel, with a quota tentatively set at 100. The examination subjects are divided into oral examination and written examination. The written examination includes four subjects: Chinese, History and Geography, Law, and Political Economy. In addition, the qualification review and physical examination of candidates are especially strict to seek the balanced development of morality, physical fitness, and academics. After passing the examination, a preliminary examination pass certificate will be issued, and the person will enter the Administrative Personnel Training Institute for one year of training. After graduation and passing the final examination, a final examination pass certificate will be issued. Those with excellent grades may be appointed as acting county magistrates. The rest will be appointed as county and city administrative staff. Those with excellent performance after one year of service may be appointed as acting county magistrates. The organizational regulations and training outline of the Administrative Personnel Training Institute will be determined separately. As for the qualifications for the examination, any citizen of the Republic of China who has one of the following qualifications may apply for this year's provisional higher examination: Those who have graduated from a public or registered private university, independent college, or vocational school and have a certificate. Those who have graduated from a foreign university, independent college, or vocational school recognized by the Ministry of Education and have a certificate. Those who have the same academic ability as a university or vocational school graduate and have passed the qualification examination. Those who have special academic knowledge or have works that have passed the review. Those who have passed the ordinary examination for four years or more, or who have served as a commissioned official or a position equivalent to a commissioned official for three years or more, with proof documents. In addition, in order to be cautious about this year's higher examination, candidates must complete the guarantee procedures, carefully write a resume, and obtain a guarantee letter signed and sealed by two current officials above the rank of Recommendation or current university professors. The guarantee letter, along with the candidate's photo, graduation certificate, or other supporting documents, should be submitted to the registration office to receive a receipt. The other details such as qualification review, physical examination, and obtaining tickets, etc., are in the regulations set by this court for reference. All qualified and outstanding young people are encouraged to apply for the examination, so that talents can emerge and be used by the country.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The provisional higher examination in the 33rd year will be held in the auditorium of the Examination Yuan in Nanjing on July 17th, in accordance with the revised measures passed by the Supreme National Defense Conference. The Examination Yuan is currently actively preparing for it. The registration period is from June 20th to July 10th.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) The National Commercial Control Association, which bears the important responsibility of national commercial control and operation under the wartime system, has been established for one year.

After discussions with various parties, a concrete plan has been obtained and will be formally announced in the coming days. However, the original chairman, Tang Shoumin, deeply felt that the future work would be more arduous and feared that he would not be able to handle it, so he earnestly resigned. The government authorities, considering Tang's sincere intention to resign, formally issued an order yesterday to specially appoint Wen Lanting as the successor chairman. Wen, who was originally the supervisor of the association, will now succeed Tang as chairman, and will be able to better express his ambitions and devote his full efforts to our control economy. It is firmly believed that the future of the control economy will definitely become more rational due to this structural adjustment.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Rikki Takagi, Vice President of the Sino-Japanese Industry Company, is one of the leading figures among Japanese "China experts." On the 13th, he met with reporters in this question and refuted the argument that "Sino-Japanese cooperation is impossible," stating in essence, "My friend Chen Youren once doubted the feasibility of Sino-Japanese cooperation, saying: 'Genuine cooperation, if not based on reciprocity, then there is absolutely no possibility of genuine cooperation. Judging from the current actual situation between China and Japan, Japan only gains from China, and has nothing to contribute to China, so it is quite difficult to achieve genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation.' We cannot deny this now. In the past, Japan certainly held this view, but since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there is an urgent need to develop a new sphere of influence. Therefore, Japan has no need to attack the densely populated Chinese mainland. Japan needs great strength to develop the undeveloped world in the South, and there is absolutely no need to conquer the Chinese mainland by force. Thus, Japan's new policy toward China has emerged at this time. And China today needs a lot of supplies from the South, such as oils, rice, rubber, and sugar, so it must rely on Japan to mediate. Mr. Chen Youren's so-called one-sided cooperation has now become mutually beneficial cooperation. Comprehensively considering the objective situation of China and Japan, I firmly believe that genuine cooperation between the two countries can be realized without doubt. The Greater East Asia War has evolved into a holy war for the liberation of Asians. The Chinese nation is the largest nation in Asia, and the Japanese people really need to cooperate with them. If China and Japan are not united, the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed at an early date. China and Japan must establish a guiding position in the new world order."</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Industry Jiang Zuoxuan Returns to Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan, Vice Minister of Industry, went to Shanghai on official business earlier and returned to Nanjing a few days ago.

(Answer) The adjustment of factories is based on the principle of centralized production. The current Ministry has contacted various parties about the three types of products: soap, matches, and candles, and the specific methods have been discussed and determined, but they must be approved by the Executive Yuan before they can be implemented. (Question) Are there any other improvement plans for Shanghai's industry and commerce? (Answer) The plan to improve Shanghai's industry and commerce is currently being investigated by the Industrial and Commercial Design Committee. It will be implemented after seeing the content of each company.</p>

<h3>Biak Enemy Positions Are Heavily Bombed; Two Cruisers Are Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from the Southwest Pacific Front reports that Japanese aircraft squadrons heavily bombed enemy ships near Biak Island on the morning of the 12th, destroying two enemy cruisers. Five Japanese aircraft did not return in this operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Air Force, in order to assist the Japanese ground troops on Biak Island, bombed the enemy army positions on Biak Island at dawn on the 12th, and confirmed that six enemy locations were set on fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Occupies Kokadan and Advances Towards Bishnupur; The Mainline Rapid Advance Team Fiercely Attacks Ningthoukhong</h3>
<p>Indian Front, 13th (Central News Agency) The elite units of the Japanese army, which had previously ravaged the enemy positions north of Sattha (10 kilometers southwest of Bishnupur), raided the enemy's heavy artillery surveying position (about 8 kilometers north of Koubimoal and southwest of Bishnupur) on the 7th and completely occupied it. The main force of the Japanese army has entered the area north of Sattha. Except for the enemy's obstruction, the Japanese military counterattack continues to resist tenaciously, and the Japanese army has launched a fierce attack, and finally defeated it, occupying the high ground north of Koubimoal, and obtaining a powerful base to attack Bishnupur. On the same day, the Japanese army broke through the enemy's position east of Koubimoal with a night attack, and seized the enemy's strongholds near the position, and the Japanese army occupied Kokadan (8 kilometers southwest of Bishnupur) in the same day. One side of the troops that advanced rapidly from the mainline also broke into the important town of Bossahaam on the morning of the 7th, completely occupied it, and then reversed and echoed the northward troops, fiercely attacking the stubborn enemy near Ningthoukhong (5 kilometers south of Bossahaam), and defeated them, and prepared to break into Bishnupur at the same time as the troops advancing westward from the mainline. The will to fight of the enemy's 23rd Division and armored troops has declined due to the recent fierce battles. Although they have repeatedly counterattacked in the past, their counterattacks have recently become weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles on the Nu River Front</p>
<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) A heroic annihilation battle has been launched on the Nu River front. The elite units of the Japanese army lured the main force of the Southwest Expeditionary Army to the front of the stronghold to annihilate it. At the same time, the Chongqing army's supplementary boats have all been sunk in the turbulent flow of the Nu River, and their attempt has been crushed. Therefore, they are currently only relying on the supply line of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing for relief, but because of the infighting between the American military officers and the Chongqing army, the air supply is also often interrupted. In addition, the command system is chaotic, and their plan to open up the New Stilwell Road has been abandoned. Now, under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, they can only linger. Although they claim to be well-equipped, the Southwest Expeditionary Army is actually extremely rudimentary. From the corpses collected by the Japanese army and the captured weapons, it is not difficult to see their poverty and weakness. In addition, since the start of the Nu River operation, as of the 10th, the Chongqing army has abandoned 4,740 corpses, captured 16 mortars, 55 light and heavy machine guns, 425 rifles, and a large amount of other food and ammunition.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Launches a Three-Dimensional Interception Battle in the Central Pacific, Sinking One Enemy Ship and Shooting Down More Than One Hundred Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5 p.m. on the 14th: On June 11th, an enemy powerful mobile force appeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands, and from the afternoon of that day to the morning of the 13th, it carried out air raids on Japanese bases such as Saipan, Tinian, and Miyakojima. On the 12th, some ships also carried out shelling. The Japanese army in each area responded to the interception, sinking one enemy ship and shooting down more than 121 enemy aircraft, destroying three, and the Japanese side suffered slight damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The American mobile force has repeatedly launched provocative attacks in the Japanese central Pacific. Following the attack on February 22nd, it reappeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands on June 11th. The local Japanese garrison had already noticed it. Therefore, the Japanese army, navy, and air force cooperated fully on the same day and launched a three-dimensional interception battle against the enemy, sinking one enemy ship, shooting down 121 enemy aircraft, and destroying three enemy aircraft, achieving a great victory. The enemy ships and aircraft squadrons first repeatedly attacked the islands of Saipan and Tinian on the 11th. The Japanese garrison shot down ten of them with fierce anti-aircraft fire, and Japanese aircraft fought an air battle, shooting down four more and destroying three. On the 12th, enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked Miyakojima, Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Rota Island. The Japanese army in various places responded with anti-aircraft artillery, shooting down more than 30 enemy aircraft on Miyakojima, 16 on Tinian Island, 15 on Saipan Island, and seven on Rota Island. On the 13th, enemy aircraft attacked Saipan Island and other places again, and seven were shot down by the Japanese army, totaling 124. Japanese aircraft also sank one enemy ship on the evening of the 11th. As for the Japanese side's damage, it was extremely slight.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attempts to Carry Out a Feint Operation in the Central Pacific: Minister Matsushima Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch The Axis forces are launching landings in Europe, and the other side is also attempting to open up the stagnant war situation in the Pacific, especially since the battle situation in western New Guinea has failed to progress according to plan, and they are very焦灼. Therefore, they are attempting to carry out a feint operation in the central Pacific, suddenly attacking the Japanese strongholds in the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific since the 11th. According to the Japanese General Headquarters, a total of more than 124 enemy aircraft were destroyed, inflicting heavy damage. Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, specifically expressed his views on this point on the 14th, and disclosed the Axis forces' determination to respond to each other from east and west and annihilate the enemy's combat power. The content of the statement is as follows: The enemy's headquarters has always advocated invading Europe while also taking the offensive in the Pacific. On June 11th, the enemy's powerful forces suddenly attacked our Mariana Islands. The enemy's operational attempt was to induce our naval forces to conduct a decisive battle in waters favorable to the enemy. However, the Imperial Navy will never be exploited by the enemy's strategy and will always give them a head-on blow according to the established policy, reaping great results, which have been announced in detail by the General Headquarters. However, in order to cover up the defeat, the enemy transferred its own losses to others, claiming to have shot down 130 Japanese aircraft, which only exposed a glimpse of the enemy's deceptive propaganda. On the other hand, the enemy on the northern coast of Biak Island, New Guinea, in the Southwest Pacific is also gradually losing its initiative under the strong pressure of the Japanese army. However, the enemy cannot permanently maintain a stagnant state in the Pacific, and since the landing operation in western 歡洲 has been launched, they must not retreat easily. Therefore, the British and American sides must not simultaneously concentrate their forces on the eastern and western fronts. Our Japanese and German forces can only consistently induce the enemy to within our own power circle, responding to each other from east and west and completely annihilating them.</p>
<h3>Large Formations of American Aircraft Attack Various Parts of Europe</h3>

<h3>Enemy Continues to Land Reinforcements, German Counterattacks in Normandy, Major Tank Battles Unfold in the Caen Area</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters dispatch reports that the Allied High Command announced on Tuesday night that German forces had launched counterattacks in two locations in the Normandy Peninsula: Montebourg and Carentan. The situation in both locations is unclear. Fierce fighting has also erupted south of Balleroy, a location 35 kilometers southwest between Bayeux and Saint-Lô. Furthermore, London news today reports that the impending Battle of Normandy will determine the future course of the war. Both the British and American forces and the German forces are concentrating large armies, hoping for a decisive victory. Between Saint-Lô and Caen, fierce fighting continues in the hills and valleys surrounding Tilly-Sur-Seulles. The two armies have alternately gained and lost control of the town of Tilly, but according to the latest reports, it remains in German hands. Paris Radio reported that it estimates that after the arrival of British and American reinforcements in the war zone on Monday night, the enemy forces along the coast number approximately thirty divisions. According to unconfirmed reports from London last night, the Allies attempted to land at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, fourteen miles east of Cherbourg. Two American divisions and tanks have landed at Barfleur, four miles north of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news yesterday, in the western area of Caen, British forces, in order to threaten the German rear, launched an attack on the German positions south of Anctoville and Bretteville at dawn on the 12th with heavy tanks and super-heavy tanks, thus the two armies began a major tank battle. The British forces used artillery fire and fighter-bombers to provide cover as much as possible, but the German forces fought bravely throughout. On the morning of the same day, the British forces lost ten tanks in the Anctoville area alone. Despite this heavy blow, the British forces did not slacken and appeared to adopt an all-day offensive, resulting in the loss of fifty-nine tanks and super-heavy tanks and being repelled, and were forced to terminate the flanking operation against the German forces east of Caen.</p>
<p>Supply Activities at Landing Points</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - A German News Agency dispatch reports that Allied supply operations are very active. At the four major landing points, fresh troops and large quantities of war materials are being unloaded. It is generally expected that the majority of General Montgomery's army group is currently concentrated in the narrow bridgehead area between the mouth of the Orne River and west of Sainte-Mère-Église. The German side expects the Allies to launch a large-scale offensive in the next few days, with the town of Caen likely being one of the Allies' main targets. The second major focus will likely be southwest of the mouth of the Vire River, while the American forces will repeat attempts to break through the Montebourg-Quineville line in order to occupy Cherbourg.</p>
<p>Cherbourg Commander Dies Heroically</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's headquarters announced at noon on the 13th that General Marx, commander of the First Army, had died heroically on the front lines while defending the Cherbourg Peninsula. The army and coastal artillery had unleashed fierce power while fighting the Allied landing forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Details International Situation at Regular Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The invasion operation in Europe is a battle that will determine the fate of the European war situation. Prime Minister Tojo sent an encouraging telegram to Führer Hitler on the 8th, expressing Japan's firm determination to carry out a common war. As the entire nation watches the trend of the invasion operation in Europe, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu explained in detail the international situation centered on the invasion operation in Europe at the regular cabinet meeting held in the Imperial Palace at 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, and sought the understanding of the cabinet members.</p>
<h3>The Path Forward for Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>— Yūmatsu Entai</p>
<p>Lecture given at National Shanghai University on the 6th of this month</p>
<p>A person's life is determined by their youth. Those who spend their youth in a time of peace have different thoughts in their lives than those who greet their student years in a time of war and revolution.</p>
<p>You have spent these past few years welcoming and sending off the era of youth amidst war, and have probably encountered many hardships. Some people in China can probably still smell the scent of war today. War is a misfortune for humanity, causing the loss of many precious lives and properties. Although everyone knows this fact, you must deeply explore its causes as this war continues. This is the meaning and task of a youth.</p>
<p>The ideological meaning of war should be an academic impulse that prevents it from recurring.</p>
<p>The war between China and Japan is based on the premise of a greater cultural leap to a higher synthesis of the opposing ideologies held by the two countries. In order for the cultures of China and Japan to achieve such a leap in synthesis, such sacrifices are naturally required. Although cultural exchange could be achieved without the devastation of this war, the destiny of Asia and the world does not allow it. The thoughts of human nations can only clear their own dogmatism from painful experiences. China and Japan, therefore, through this war, pointed out each other's strengths and weaknesses, and understood the common form of the destinies of China and Japan. What caused the two countries to meet in battle was "non-Asians," and the cause was Anglo-American thought. This truth has become clear after great sacrifice. I believe that the leaders in Chongqing will soon reach the same understanding.</p>
<p>On December 8, 1941, the Greater East Asia War finally began due to Japan's decisiveness and courage. The precedent of a yellow race declaring war on the two largest countries in the world, England and America, has never been seen in Asian history. This war, as the name suggests, has a very deep meaning in the discovery and establishment of "Greater East Asian thought." That naturally requires driving out the political and economic greed of England and America from the lands of East Asia; but it actually lies in breaking the worship of Anglo-America, which is eating away at the minds of Orientals. It is of philosophical significance to eradicate from Greater East Asia the erroneous prejudice that has for centuries been superstitious about Westerners as superior people and Orientals as inferior people. At the same time, the various countries of "Greater East Asia" need to shake hands completely on the truth of the Eastern spirit, with a common intention befitting their name.</p>
<p>The Classical Spirit of China</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, I asked a college student: "What do you praise China for?" But he did not give me a clear answer. Although they call themselves "Republic of China," the Chinese, especially the youth, lack confidence in their own culture. Boasting about the buildings and streets of Nanjing Road and praising the missionary universities are just praising Europe and America. What exactly do you praise China for? Whether you say it is a civilization with a history of five thousand years, or say "vast land and abundant resources," from the current organizational structure, those are presenting their opposite, the dark side. So, shall I answer for you? I think that throughout the lands and cities of East Asia, the classical spirit of China is still alive even today. The Confucian thought of Confucius and Mencius, the Taoist thought of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi, and the Buddhist thought that prospered in China after being transmitted from India—these classical spirits of China are still alive today as Eastern ideals and are active.</p>
<p>The "Greater East Asia War," which was initiated by Japan's courage and confidence, is not for the benefit of Japan alone, but is for the happiness of the one billion people of East Asia. This war has a broad meaning, and is the same as China before the Qing Dynasty, in any era, taking all of East Asia as the object of thought and action. This is not China for China alone, but China for all of East Asia. That is why there is a meaning to the name "China". However, since the end of the Ming Dynasty, due to the input of Western civilization, China has abandoned its ideological autonomy. Not only have concessions and settlements been opened up in various parts of China, but even Chinese thought has become a colony of England and America, thus forgetting the classical spirit of China and falling into the worship of Europe and America. As a result, Chinese thought became humble and self-deprecating. The "China of Greater East Asia" kind of self-sacrifice on the part of Japan is to open up the true meaning of the "Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>On January 9, 1943, the National Government had already noticed this deep meaning and declared war on England and America, and therefore you have become comrades in the Greater East Asia War. Japan's victory is China's victory. However, some of you may be misled by the news of Anglo-American propaganda, mistaken about the Anglo-American war power, and doubt Japan's victory. This is not unreasonable either. But if that is the case, you are not comrades. If you are comrades, you should worry about Japan. You should give advice and assistance. And there should be an organization of volunteer soldiers to destroy England and America. I understand your feelings, but it has been two and a half years since the boasting that three of them could defeat Japan in this war. The way things look, this war will be a stalemate for ten years. Victory or defeat is not only based on weapons and military power. The spirit of dying for the country is the final victory. "Japan's invincibility"—this is what I can say definitively here. Only in this way can "Greater East Asia" be achieved, which is the goal of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Since the National Government declared war, as I said just now, although the mobilization of volunteer soldiers has not been heard, it has provided enormous material support to Japan to assist Japan's war effort. It has supplied a considerable amount of food to the Japanese army stationed in China, which should be thanked. Naturally, this may cause many difficulties for the Chinese people. However, China's ability to endure this suffering is evidence of participation in the war, and is a comrade's duty. Japan has already taken the lead in returning concessions to various countries, and further assists China's autonomy and independence. It would be a big mistake if Chinese youth see this as an act of drawing a lottery ticket. There will be no autonomy without price and sacrifice. To shed the character of a semi-colony of centuries is "this Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>For the next ten years of war, followed by fifty years of economic and ideological war, it is necessary to win in order for China's independence and autonomy to be established. Japan is providing its blood and flesh for the sake of this Chinese autonomy.</p>
<p>I unconsciously said too much about the meaning of war and the political complexities. It's not that I said too many political things to Chinese youth. Why? This is because you think too much about politics. It's because you are precocious. Politics, as the word indicates, means "to correct with writing," which is its true meaning. What political movement should young people who lack education and have little experience do? Politics is based on "virtue." Political will naturally arise from the virtue of personality. People who are not elders cannot improve their noble morality. Chinese politics, to put it bluntly, cannot be said to be good. Because that is young people doing politics with signs and leaflets of propaganda. The best leaflet is one that does not need paper, the so-called "governing does not lie in many words." It is to show the people with a good example of oneself. Then, the people's livelihood and people's rights can be promoted smoothly.</p>
<p>Youth Should Bury Themselves in Learning</p>
<p>Naturally, I know why you are so concerned about politics. Today's events in China will naturally involve the youth in political movements. And that may find opportunities for one to rise. But I hope everyone will wait a bit. Young people don't need to rise early. Only poor youth can devote themselves to studying. I did not enter society until I was thirty years old, and I studied diligently. Naturally, young people's hearts will feel dissatisfied and excited about politics. This conscience is the important flower of youth, but this flower must never be picked early. Therefore, one should suppress one's feelings and bury oneself in the school window. Political movements are to find a shortcut to rise. If this is the case, good outcomes will be difficult to produce. If you want to build a real China in fifty years, the learning that should be done at present, rather than studying politics, it is more important to learn more about political history and political ethics. When highly educated Chinese talents emerge in large numbers, a new China will be produced.</p>
<p>I smiled when I heard that many people in Chinese universities major in politics and economics. Because this is very similar to the Meiji era in Japan. At that time, after the Meiji Restoration, young people had ambitions to conquer the Central Plains. However, soon, this trend stopped, and young people devoted themselves to basic and practical learning. As a result, Japan was able to leap forward, and a scientific Japan and a technological Japan were born. Which direction should Chinese youth move forward in the future? I would like to give some frank advice here. Politics is fine, and economics is fine. But superficial learning that wants to rise immediately after graduating is not possible. One should do a kind of basic, theoretical, and principle-based learning. Especially in Shanghai, because it is a trading port, commercial thinking is particularly strong. Although commerce is important, Asia cannot be a market for England and America in the future. Neither Japan nor China can but become a factory that supplies goods to the entire Asian market.

<h3>First District to Distribute Coal Balls and Coal Blocks Starting Today, Four Catties of Coal Balls, Three Catties of Smokeless Coal</h3>
<p>The First District Public Office has decided that from June 15th to the 30th of the same month, each designated coal ball retail store in the district will distribute the fifth phase of allocated coal and coal balls. During the above-mentioned period, citizens can purchase three catties of Jiaozuo smokeless lump coal and four catties of coal balls at a price of 12.60 yuan (national currency) by presenting the fifth coal ball ration ticket with the registered number indicated on the ticket to the coal ball retail store. The coal balls should contain at least 50% coal dust, and the Jiaozuo smokeless lump coal should not contain more than 20% coal seams and more than 10% rock inclusions. Retail donations are exempted. If retail stores violate the regulations, citizens should immediately report it to the nearest police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Fifth Phase Household Coal Balls. In order to prevent the manufacturers of household coal balls from cutting corners and using inferior coal balls as rations, the First District Economic Bureau has specially instructed the Shanghai Coal Ball Factory Association to not add impurities. If there is any violation, it will be strictly investigated and dealt with immediately, and its qualification as a manufacturer of rationed coal balls will be revoked. On the one hand, it notifies each rationed coal ball retailer to pay attention to the allocated household coal balls. If there are any non-compliant ingredients, or adulteration of impurities, and cutting corners, they may refuse to accept the goods, and report it to the office for investigation. If the coal ball retailers fail to comply and privately receive inferior coal balls and distribute them to users, once verified or accused, the full responsibility will be borne by the retailers. Not only will their qualifications as retailers be revoked, but their deposits will also be confiscated without leniency. As for the rationed smokeless lump coal, which is Jiaozuo lump coal, the coal contains 20% rock inclusions and 20% coal seams. When citizens rely on their registration to purchase coal, they should pay attention to its composition. If inferior quality is found, they should immediately report it to the office, and it will be strictly investigated.</p>
<p>Zhabei Distributes Coal Balls, Soap</p>
<p>The Zhabei Township Office has successively issued the third phase of household coal balls and the first, second, and third phases of soap and matches certificates to citizens for purchase, and has decided to start issuing certificates from the 16th of this month and start selling from the 20th of the same month, ending on the 29th of the same month. Citizens may carry their purchase certificates to the designated merchants for purchase within the time limit. Each certificate can purchase ten catties of coal balls, one bar of soap, and one small box of matches.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Press Department Held Regular Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Japan in Shanghai held a regular press conference yesterday (14th) at 2:00 p.m. at the China Hotel on the 8th floor of Nanjing Road, inviting the Chinese journalist corps of the city. Lieutenant Sakaki of the military press department attended, and the speaker first gave a detailed analysis of the war situation in Asia and Europe, and also gave a detailed explanation of the Allied British and American troops' current invasion, saying that the German army has long made thorough preparations against the enemy British and American plot, and it is deeply believed that after the current aimless British and American counter-attack, they have indeed suffered great setbacks after a strong and powerful attack by the German army, and the losses of the British and American troops are particularly heavy.</p>
<h3>Health Campaign Conference, Exhibition Ends</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Campaign Conference, which opened on the 1st of this month, has achieved excellent results in various activities such as cleaning campaigns, rat and fly extermination campaigns, anti-spitting campaigns, and epidemic prevention campaigns, which have been organized by the authorities, various agencies, groups, and bao-chia service personnel, leading citizens to carry out the activities on schedule. However, the exhibition was suspended by the sports association due to the selection of the second round of Marseille ball games. After repeated requests for an extension from all walks of life, the health authorities approved an extension to the 15th of this month. The number of visitors in the past half month is estimated to be over 300,000. The next conference will be held on December 15th in accordance with central regulations. It is reported that the health authorities believe that it is necessary to expand and promote health education in the city, so after the conclusion of this conference, they will immediately prepare for various activities for the next conference.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Director Yuan Forbids Gift-Giving During Festivals</h3>
<p>Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, has repeatedly strictly prohibited the bureau's staff from giving gifts during the New Year's holidays, as well as the staff from taking advantage of their positions to receive gifts from merchants. Director Yuan, who also serves as the Director of the Finance Department of the First District, is deeply concerned that the staff in the department may continue this bad habit, so he issued a handwritten order, strictly prohibiting giving and receiving gifts.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Earth Wells Disinfected</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of the Municipal Health Bureau and the Municipal Office, Nanshi District has launched a comprehensive epidemic prevention campaign. Over the past few days, people have been supervised to carry out earth well disinfection. All rotten earth wells have been filled in. As of yesterday, the first phase of disinfection work for all 258 earth wells in the district has been completed.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Rent Increase Dispute Resolved Through Mediation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Company's single-seat passenger vehicles have always been rented by coolies for passenger business. The method is exactly the same as that of public rickshaws. In September of last year, a dispute arose between labor and management due to an increase in rent, which was resolved through mediation by the Social Welfare Bureau. In the previous month, the company charged rickshaw pullers a subsidy for tires and hardware due to the rising prices of tires and hardware parts, while the rickshaw pullers felt that the increase was too large and they could not afford it, and another dispute arose between the two parties. Later, the rickshaw pullers sent representatives to the Social Welfare Bureau to request handling. After the bureau convened the two parties for multiple mediations and gave sincere guidance, the bureau resolved the dispute through mediation the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Strictly Prohibits Private Sale of Pledged Securities by Banks</p>
<p>Recently, emerging financial institutions in Shanghai have often used funds to engage in speculative trading or hoard materials, manipulating prices, and disrupting prices. After the Central Bank of China tightened interbank lending and restricted loan business, the hoarding of materials could not make their old tricks. Unexpectedly, some financial institutions have recently privately sold securities of collateral. This kind of behavior affects the entire enterprise and hinders the stability of finance. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, in view of this, has specially ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank to notify them separately, strictly prohibit them, and conduct random inspections at any time. If they dare to intentionally violate the regulations, they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>People in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist Circles Must Unite: Professor Tomomatsu Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Professor Tomomatsu, the second lecturer in the wartime academic lecture series co-sponsored by the Shinpao and this newspaper, is about to depart for Suzhou, Beijing, and other places in North China to investigate Chinese Buddhism. He regrets not being able to conduct a thorough investigation. I am quite interested in the Buddhist circles of your country and have discovered several unique characteristics, as follows: 　There are extremely great figures in the Chinese Buddhist community, rare individuals in terms of both their character and learning. 　Chinese Buddhism has a unique influence and maintains no relationship with the government or the military. 　Buddhism enjoys considerable faith among the general populace, thus the relationship between the people and Buddhist beliefs is very close. 　The cultivation and practice of Buddhism are taken very seriously and profoundly, and practices such as Zen meditation have special significance. 　Regarding Buddhist scholarship, although the groups are not large, each has its own very profound research, making them invaluable to the world.</p>
<p>The above are all the advantages of Chinese Buddhism, but there are also some shortcomings. Namely, although the Chinese Buddhist community is limited in some ways, it lacks a unified national organization. It is hoped that a unified Buddhist organization can be formed quickly in the future. 　The facilities for Buddhist education are not comprehensive enough. 　Although there are temples throughout China, there is no comprehensive Buddhist academy. 　The research methods of Buddhist studies in various regions all adopt original, traditional methods, with little progress. 　The theoretical schools of Buddhism and the practical schools of cultivation have not yet moved towards collaboration and cooperation.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the Japanese Buddhist community, I will state frankly that I feel that Buddhist circles in both China and Japan must unite, communicate with each other, and cooperate with each other in the future. The methods of cooperation can be divided into two aspects: one is the academic aspect, and the other is the business aspect. Regarding the former, China and Japan must exchange Buddhist figures, such as the mutual exchange of Buddhist scholars and monks, and the exchange of published books on Buddhist research, all of which are urgently needed. Regarding the latter, such as social undertakings and charitable undertakings (such as hospitals and schools), China and Japan must cooperate and exchange in terms of methods, materials, and personnel. If there are various social undertakings that have not yet been launched and require assistance from the Japanese Buddhist community, Japan can send experienced people to provide assistance. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese Buddhist community itself can also be more enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. In this way, not only can it gain more popular support, but also China and Japan can cooperate with each other even better. If this is the case, a century of amity can naturally be achieved. I firmly believe that if the two major nations of China and Japan share the same faith, the friendship between the two countries will not be difficult."</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki Returns Home from Shanghai</p>
<p>The wartime academic lecture series jointly sponsored by this newspaper and the Shinpao specially invited Dr. Sasaki from the Allied nations to come to Shanghai to give lectures. After coming to China, Dr. Sasaki lectured in various places in Beijing and Shanghai and was well received. Now that his itinerary has been completed, he is scheduled to return to his country today. Before leaving, he donated 2,500 yuan each to the scholarship fund of this newspaper and the loan fund of the Shinpao. His enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<h3>Report on Donations to the Scholarship Football Charity Match</h3>
<p>Ding Huikang and Xie Xiaochu, 10,000 yuan each. Anonymous person and Xi Jingji, 3,000 yuan each. Gongji, Sun Mingqi, Ding Huikang (Yuekang Electrical Appliance Store), and Shi Jingdao, 2,000 yuan each. Xueji and Zhongji, 1,000 yuan each. Tao Mujian, 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The above totals 36,500 yuan, and the previous total was 581,700 yuan.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Sending Off Dr. Sasaki</h3>
<p>Considering the weak atmosphere of academic research in the Peace Zone, the Shinpao and this newspaper jointly organized the "Wartime Academic Lecture Series" in order to increase interest in academic research. The first lecturer invited was Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from the Allied nation of Japan. The doctor arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of last month and left Shanghai to return to his country today, lasting for a month, and held lectures and seminars in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou and other places, and visited agricultural organizations and institutions. During this period, he traveled busily and did not have time to rest. He has had a great influence on Chinese agriculture, which is a gratifying thing in the midst of calls for increased agricultural production in China. It is not only a blessing for the Shinpao and this newspaper, but also for the entire country's agriculture.</p>
<p>Speaking of the main task of increasing production, technical improvement is of course necessary. According to Dr. Sasaki, the statistical comparison of agricultural and animal husbandry production between China and Japan is as follows:</p>
<p>(Note: One shi of milk equals two shi in China. The highest daily milk production in Japan is the world record.)</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Japan's technical improvements in agriculture and animal husbandry have achieved excellent results, and we should catch up. However, in China's rural environment, in order to achieve effective results in increasing production, in addition to seeking technical improvements, political improvements are also needed, such as establishing security, abolishing excessive taxes and levies, and the factors that lead to reduced production must be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>We deeply feel that what China needs most in Sino-Japanese cooperation is people like Dr. Sasaki to come to China to take on the task of practical guidance, so that the outdated phenomena of Chinese society can be effectively and scientifically improved and modernized. We have put forward this view before, especially since Dr. Sasaki's visit to China has shown a sincere and enthusiastic attitude, which has strengthened our view. We hope that those who care about cooperation between the two countries will pay full attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, before returning to his country, Dr. Sasaki specially donated 2,500 yuan each to the scholarship funds of this newspaper and the Shinpao. He also said that after returning home, he will fulfill his greatest teaching responsibility to Chinese students studying in Japan. This attitude of valuing education and being enthusiastic about education has especially moved us.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the Ministry of Industry and its affiliated agricultural agencies, the Hangzhou Municipal Government of Zhejiang Province, and universities, agricultural organizations, and experts in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou for their great assistance.</p>

<h3>Scholarship Basketball Charity Match: West Youth Wins Over Central Youth, Each Wins One Game, Finals Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>In the second act of the scholarship basketball game of this newspaper, Central Youth and West Youth met again at the Central Youth Gymnasium yesterday. The audience was more crowded than the first final. As a result, West Youth triumphed with a score of 29 to 11, creating an equal situation of one win each. The Central and West powerhouses will have a final match at the same venue at 8 p.m. tomorrow night. Before the game, the winners of the Shanghai bodybuilding competition will perform as an interlude, which will be one of the highlights of tomorrow night's program. The following is a brief record of yesterday's battle:</p>
<p>Changing Situation</p>
<p>Referee Liu Hesheng and Yuan Zifang. The game started at 8 p.m. Central Youth had a strong momentum and took the initiative. Boutuo was called for hitting someone and returned to the game. Lin Weiting scored a point, opening the record. Then Yu Yuzi fouled, and West Youth tied the score. Oscar dragged the ball into the basket, and Ma Xi returned the favor. Yu Yuzi scored a free throw, and Central Youth led 5 to 3. West Youth called a timeout, and Zhang Jin entered the game to replace Li Donghe. West Youth's defense was as solid as gold. Central Youth repeatedly tried to break through the center but failed. After Ma Canxi established a merit by himself, the situation changed suddenly, and West Youth took the initiative instead. Kaijie Miluofu and Funike sang in harmony, and Yerong added the finishing touch. At the end of the first half, West Youth led 10 to 7.</p>
<p>Abnormal Performance</p>
<p>After resting and fighting again, the generals of Central Youth worked together with all their might to try to turn the tide, but the heavens did not help them. Yu Yuzi missed in the second zone. Kaijie Miluofu broke through the sideline and actually scored. Boutuo also shot from the middle line and scored. Funike ran around the court and scored three points. Central Youth gradually became inadequate. Only Shunzi managed to pull back two points. Then Yerong flipped over under the Central Youth basket and scored another one. Time was up, and West Youth triumphed with a score of 29 to 11. Central Youth's performance yesterday was very abnormal. There were a lot of wastes. They only scored five points out of seventeen free throws. West Youth's defense yesterday was excellent, and their victory was not accidental.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Urging the Collection of Application Forms</h3>
<p>Since the distribution of the application forms for the seventh session of the reader scholarship of this newspaper began a few days ago, many schools have collected them. All those who disclosed the number of applicants on or before the 13th have been checked. If you have not received it yet, please come and collect it immediately. Today is the last day for schools to disclose the number of applicants. Except for a few schools that have sent letters explaining the reasons for a temporary postponement, no more applications will be accepted after the deadline. However, for those who have already disclosed the number of applicants, the application forms will continue to be distributed in the future. Individual students who cannot apply to the school due to special circumstances can submit a handwritten letter stating the reasons and apply directly tomorrow or Saturday morning. This application is limited to a very small number of students, and it must be proved that they were not rejected by the school because they were unqualified, nor were they rejected because the number of applicants in the school was too large before they can be accepted. Since this type of student is not recommended by the school, the review must be particularly strict. Those who cannot confidently claim to be "poor and excellent" will definitely not be approved, please do not try, wasting time and energy.</p>
<p>Regarding the number of application forms issued, the office will issue 15 application forms per 100 students, unless the number of recipients in the sixth session has already exceeded this percentage, no exceptions will be made. However, additional application forms for graduates or transfer students account for one-fourth of the total number. A small number of schools did not clearly calculate the standards and thought that all the forms were discounted and issued according to the number of applicants, which is not the case. In fact, many schools have strictly limited the number of applicants themselves, and the office will issue them in full if the number disclosed is within the prescribed limit, without discounting. Some schools mistakenly included elementary school and kindergarten students in the calculation, and the result was of course very different, not because the office's arithmetic was wrong. In addition, the staff of the office have been busy issuing application forms in recent days. It is hoped that the school authorities, parents and students will pay attention to the news in this newspaper at any time and handle everything in accordance with the prescribed procedures. We apologize for not being able to answer every letter that asks questions or makes requests. The Health Exhibition will be open all day today only and will not charge admission. The Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory has special offers for sale at the venue. Welcome to visit a corner of the Racecourse Health Exhibition (Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory)</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Directors and Supervisors of Limited Liability Companies</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>The powers, responsibilities and tasks of directors and supervisors of limited liability companies are stipulated in the Company Law, which need not be repeated. However, most of the directors and supervisors of general limited liability companies today are directors in name only, and supervisors do not supervise. They only hold the titles of directors and supervisors and do not perform the powers, responsibilities and tasks stipulated in the Company Law. The reason why they can become directors and supervisors is either because the company values their social status and reputation, so that it is easy to raise funds and take on the role out of favoritism. Or, they use the purchase of company shares as a condition to raise their status. Or, they use the solicitation of funds as an exchange condition to recommend their children to take on important positions in the company. They never consider whether their children's talents and knowledge can be competent, let alone the interests of the company.</p>
<p>The board of directors is the head of the company's administrative system. All major tasks in the company are elected by the shareholders, and the directors and supervisors form the board of directors and supervisors, which bears the major responsibility. If they are not up to the task and abuse their power, they will only say yes or no at every meeting, echoing what others say, and abandon their responsibilities as directors and supervisors. They will take the will of the chairman or general manager of the company as their will. If the chairman or general manager of such a company is virtuous and capable, the business can still develop even if there is a board of directors and supervisors that is merely a formality. On the contrary, if power falls into the wrong hands, the person in power will regard the company as private property and the board of directors and supervisors as nothing. They will not convene meetings of the board of directors and supervisors according to the prescribed date. In the event of major business, they will not ask the board of directors and supervisors for instructions, creating a dictatorship. Moreover, if corruption arises, the company's future will be severely affected, and the shareholders' blood and sweat will be discounted. The personal reputation of the directors and supervisors will also be affected. Therefore, it is hoped that those who are currently serving as directors and supervisors of companies should pay attention to the importance of their own powers, responsibilities and tasks, and do not voluntarily give them up, which will be of great benefit to the company's future.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Moral Education Association Organizes Joint Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution</h3>
<p>In addition to the long-term charitable activities of providing porridge, materials, tea, collecting infant corpses, small loans, and free schools, the Chinese Moral Education Association on Zhengyang Road (formerly Tongfu Road) is now planning to launch 12 joint free clinics and medicine distribution centers in the city and other cities, including Chengdu Road, Yongkang Road, Yangshupu, Kunshan, Wuxian, Wuxi, Yinxian, Changshu, Wujin, Wuxi Sanfo Temple, Wujin Shizhuang, and Wuxi Meicun, in order to save the poor and sick, as the weather is getting hotter and epidemics are difficult to avoid. It is scheduled to start on the first day of the fifth lunar month.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lin Dawei's Charity Sale of Fan Surfaces</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Dawei is fond of writing and excels at small regular script, which is admired by the artistic community. Now he is willing to donate one of his recent works, a fan surface with a small regular script of the Diamond Sutra, for charity sale. The characters are only half the size of rice grains, and the strokes are as thin as hairs, which shows his skill. The price is 30,000 yuan, and all the proceeds will be used for the charity expenses of this office. His enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. The fan is on display at this office, and you are welcome to visit. Purchasers will not only obtain a famous work, but also help a charity, which is truly a benevolent act. Mr. Lin also has another piece, which he entrusted to Shuyun Ji Fan Store opposite the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road for consignment sale. Those who love Mr. Lin's art can also visit nearby.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Person Donates 100,000 Yuan to Help Charity</h3>
<p>This office is grateful to an anonymous person for donating 100,000 yuan to help the scholarship fund of this newspaper, the fund for helping orphans, the fund for helping elementary school students, and the expenses of educational institutions, benefiting the poor people. The details are as follows: 50,000 yuan for the scholarship fund, 10,000 yuan each for Fuyou Orphanage, Pingjiang Educational Institution, Wuxi Poor Children's Educational Institution of the Chinese Moral Education Association, and Hengde Society, and 5,000 yuan each for the fund for helping elementary school students and the fund for helping orphans.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Smoking Cessation Hospital</h3>
<p>Recently, the government has issued a ban on smoking and set a time limit for quitting in order to eliminate the harm. The Department of Health has specially established the Shanghai Smoking Cessation Hospital, and the former site of the former Shanghai Local Court on Nanshi Station Road has been converted into a hospital. It is reported that the hospital has 40 men's wards and more than 10 women's wards. It will start accepting smoking cessation patients next month and will force them to quit within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Preventing Leprosy</h3>
<p>The cause of leprosy is mostly due to the invasion of leprosy bacilli, and the route of invasion is often through broken skin or mucous membranes such as the nasal cavity and mouth. Therefore, leprosy is undoubtedly a contagious disease.</p>
<p>The public's prevention method is to confine the patients in one place, so that they are completely isolated from the general healthy people. Therefore, the establishment of leprosy sanatoriums is a beneficial method for both the general society and the patients. It is best to completely disinfect and remove the patients' belongings and contaminated items.</p>
<p>The personal prevention method is to prioritize cleanliness. Rats, flies, and mosquitoes are the media for spreading the disease and should be eliminated. It is especially important not to have direct contact with patients and their belongings, and to disinfect and wash them thoroughly.</p>
<p>If you find any suspicious signs, you should consult a specialist for examination. Once confirmed, you should be admitted to the leprosy sanatorium. This will give you hope for recovery and prevent the spread of the disease, which would otherwise be alarming to society. The China Leprosy Relief Association has leprosy sanatoriums and leprosy clinics. If you are poor and sick, you can receive free treatment. If you want to inquire or donate, you can go to the office of the association at No. 53, Lane 612, Jingan Temple Road.</p>

Now that the weather is warm and the meningitis epidemic has subsided, the hospital has closed the isolation ward and is scheduled to officially open on June 15.</p>
