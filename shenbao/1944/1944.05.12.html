<p>社評</p>
<h3>名譽第一</h3>
<p>民間有一句俗諺，叫做：「不愁人不知，除非己莫為」。意思是說，任何秘密事情，主觀上雖然認為神不知鬼不覺的，可是，做了以後，慢慢的總會被人們發覺的。所以，只有根本不做，才不會被人發覺。不過，這裏所說做的事情，總會被人發覺的，並不是專指壞的事情。當然，也包括好的事情。做了好的事情，雖然自己不想露名，可是，被人發覺以後，格外令人肅然起敬。反之，做了壞的事情，雖然自己想掩飾，可是，被人發覺以後，格外令人齒冷鄙視。前者是名譽增光，後者是名譽掃地。孰棄孰從，我們相信每個人都有理智去選擇的。然而，人們往往因為過於信任了「秘密一，做了被人齒令的事情，結果名譽掃地，這個一念之差，躭誤了多少人的名譽，可不愼哉。</p>
<p>「貪汚」，是不名譽的事情，我們可以斷言，就是做出貪汚事情的人們，也很明白了追悔不及的不名譽事情。不過，我們再分析貪汚的動機，有一部分是基於生活上的壓迫，雖然明知貪汚是壞事，而忍不住生活壓迫，就冒險貪汚。這一種貪汚，可以說「為了生活而貪汚」。還有一部分對於生活根本不成問題，明知貪汚而不惜貪汚，這一種貪汚，可以說「為了貪汚而貪汚」。兩相比較，固然同樣是不名譽的貪汚，可是，動機之間，不無若干差別，因此，在名譽上的損失，也不無若干差別。</p>
<p>其次，追求投機暴利，也是不名譽的事情，如與貪汚比較，在客觀上似乎差勝一籌。其實，追求投機暴利者，其居心必然是不擇手段，不顧大衆，損人利已，惟圖私利。其與貪汚的損人利已之居心，初無二致。所以，我們可以說，暴利主義者，貪汚主義者，都是毀損名譽者，如必欲衡量高下，簡直是五十步與百步間耳。</p>
<p>譬如顧實衡周乃文會身爲部長次長之尊，甘心貪汚，其初未嘗不知是不名譽事，但誤認秘密，更誤信地位可以遮蓋一切，迨案發以後，搜查顧之住宅時，據傳搜出女裝皮大衣三十餘件之多，從此可以預想豪富之處，貪汚的動機，絕不是生活壓迫，而爲貪汚而貪汚，一旦爲階下之囚，豈不名譽掃地。</p>
<p>又如目前上海經濟界中，不必諱言的，很多追求投機暴利者，不擇手段，只圖私利，於是正當工商事業，陷於停滯，不上軌道。寖假而促使整個經濟趨於崩潰。在暴利主義者的本身，也許認為並無不名譽。然而，這完全是錯覺，誠如前面所說，他們的居心是損人利已的，實實上與貪汚一樣的不名譽。</p>
<p>人生當以名譽為第一。前車之覆，殷鑑不遠。我們希望國家的高級官吏，上海經濟界的上層人士，愛惜名譽，寳貴名譽，尤其在此大東亞戰爭的決戰階段，國家存亡的危急之秋，多為國計民生打算，多為大衆利益着想，不做貪汚事情，不為投機暴利。</p>
<p>名譽第一！名譽第一！</p>
<h3>緬甸北部空戰之一幕　—敵超重轟炸機被擊落—</h3>
<p>四月二十六日，日空軍首在緬甸北部山中擊落敵方新型超重轟炸機一架。以下為參加該役日空軍戰士所談激戰時情形。</p>
<p>營邊大尉率領飛機一人是日在戰塲上空約四千五百米的高度巡弋。十二時左右，正在班康巴（伊姆法爾東北向三十公里）上空飛翔時，黑澤大尉的友機木村少尉突然發出發見敵機的信號。看時，在編隊右方約五百米的上空從頓斯基亞或第格波方面飛來體積寵大的四引擎轟炸機一架，有二架戰鬥機護衛着。</p>
<p>那是陶格拉斯機。乃一同向之攻擊。掩護的戰鬥機立即轉過身來向西方逃走。剩下的大型機，增加速度欲仍向原來的方向逃脫。我機緊追不捨，到阿拉干山脈上空時，中村大尉發射了第一彈，此時的距離僅二三十米，敵機似發狂般從腹部及尾部應射。大尉被敵機從尾部射出的機槍射中數彈，祗能脫離。敵人現在沿中印空路一直向中國方面逃去。接着，隅野中尉從敵前面猛烈射擊，但燃料在先前巡弋時已經消耗快盡了。於是我們分為二隊，黑澤大尉的一隊繞至前方，其餘在後方前後夾攻。所發子彈完全命中，可是敵人的裝甲實在厚得可以，各部份雖被彈累累，仍若無其事的在原高度繼續水平飛行。從班康巴一直迫了四百五十公里，快近緬甸北方的福特海爾茲了。敵人開始不支，那巨體漸見動搖不穩。隅行中尉再加以最後的一擊，終於噗噗的冒出黑烟，右內方發動機停止了。黑烟逐漸濃厚，巨體搖盪下落。那時候各機燃料都快用盡，引警也燒得灼熱。全隊乃高奏凱歌，歸還基地。（翔；譯自五月二日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>仰光十一日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍航空部隊，六日上午以戰鬥轟炸機關合編隊，襲擊某地附近之敵陣，衝過敵方之猛烈高射砲彈，進抵敵陣上空，當由轟炸機隊及俯衝式轟炸機隊對敵砲兵陣地及軍事設施等加以痛烈轟炸，並與迎擊之敵機十架交戰，擊落其一架。旋又擊落陶格拉斯敵運輸機一架，是役日機自炸三架。又當日上午，日戰鬥機一隊奇襲拉姆機塲，炸毀停於地上之敵中型機二架，小型機四架，並炸毀滑走路及機塲設備等，日機全部安然返防。</p>

<h3>日軍別動隊　已迫近洛陽　在城南擴大戰果中</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　河南戰綫之日軍，仍在順利進展。據十日合衆社重慶電，呼應迫近洛陽近郊日軍之別動隊，已於該城南方地區，擴大戰果中云云。</p>
<p>渝共磨擦日益深刻</p>
<p>新鄭十一日中央社電　河南前綫十一日電，渝軍與中共軍自呼號夏季總反攻以來，莫不積極擴充軍備。據此間俘虜傳稱，河南方面之第十四軍，於三月十七日因受命封鎖共黨，曾移駐陝西。同時共產軍方面，亦以對日總反攻為藉口，極力於延安南部修築陳地，並預定如對重慶作戰失敗時，將以山西北部，陝西境北角，新黃河為最後抵抗綫。又中共就西北軍區之西部一帶，似正修築陣地中，所謂對日總反攻，不過為重慶與共黨之招牌，各充實自己兵力而已。</p>
<p>關於征兵一項，前年起，於兩方面已同時施行，但成績頗劣。即使用於總反攻之士兵素質，亦甚低下。蔣系第十三軍第四師長蔡劍鳴，曾一度作徹底之訓練夢想，並於今春曾令部下對士兵訓練，不得稍有懈怠。又擴軍工作之最大難題，為士兵薪餉與彈藥之不足，第一戰區前曾設法扣發士兵薪餉百分之二十，謂以作反攻基金，並使繳回現有彈藥三分之二，以備總反攻之用。以總反攻掩飾其擴張軍備，及物資不足之情形，實可想見。又於洛陽之中央，中國，農民，四明，四大銀行，因總反攻之計劃，刻已一齊被令遷往西安。並決與經濟有關之各機關，亦將逐漸開始遷移，此種未戰先退之不當措置，其結果恐唯有徒使抗戰民衆士氣為之低洛而已</p>
<p>渝未認淸日軍企圖</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　日軍在豫省突然展開攻勢後，渝方根本未認淸日軍之企圖。頃據路透社電，渝宣傳部部長梁寒操，於三日會見外人記者時，曾談稱日軍此舉，在企圖打通平漢綫，故軍事當局觀測洛陽非日軍之目標，渝軍兵力雖不及日軍，智能則優於日軍，相信必可將日軍擊退云。然其後日軍作戰順利進展，渝方即感動搖。據合衆社電，渝行政院參事張平羣，於十日接見記者，表示希望英美緊急救援渝軍。又據基督徒科學報駐渝訪員七日訊，渝第一戰區崩潰後，日軍已自隴海綫開始西進，自戰略之見地觀之，亦痛感渝府極有改組之必要。九日之每日電訊報，亦著論謂，豫省日軍之作戰進展甚速。過去三週，各方面日軍前進共達三百餘公里，刻雖尙未判明日軍是否乃以西安為目標，而日軍在中國戰綫企圖，將用類似歐洲之電擊戰術亦已證實。此次豫省。軍之進攻，與過去四五年春秋二季，日軍為偵察渝軍軍情，確保資源所展開之作戰，根本不同。更不能與長沙作戰作同日語，蓋長沙地區非丘陵即湖沼，不適使用現代兵器。</p>
<p>茲就當前之實情觀之，美空軍旣不能在戰塲附近握有機塲，故當實際作戰時，實不能與渝軍地上部隊協力。日軍此次發動攻勢，實為渝軍事當局，及外國軍事當局所夢想不及者。即重慶當局內部亦曾引起莫大之衝動。渝立法院孫科最近之演說，及在西安之國共交涉，實為重慶日暮途窮之表現。</p>
<p>豫省乃東洋史上著稱之中央平原，日渝兩軍，可在此集結一要兵器，故日渝兩軍之戰力，觀此次作戰之推移，當可明瞭。日軍遍用機甲兵力，自平渶綫向洛陽進攻，利用機械車輛，充分發揮砲火之威力與機動性。僅二十日間，在事實土即將黃河至信陽間之渝軍完全掃蕩。又紐約泰晤士週刋，亦有轉載重慶之消息如次：最近日軍似謀打通平漢綫，又此次日軍進攻洛陽，其目的在從側面掩護主力作戰，至日軍此次是否永遠佔據洛陽，至今仍未能推定。此外對渝軍之作戰計劃，亦殊欠明瞭，因重慶方面之發言人，僅謂，渝軍不欲在鐵路沿綫抗戰。但日軍首次採取德國式電擊作戰，實使茍日渝安之渝軍，驚惶失措。</p>
<h3>緬甸資源豐富　待協力開發　小川顧問在大阪談話</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　緬甸政府日人經濟顧問小川鄉多郞氏，頃為協商要公歸國，九日在大阪商工經濟會報吿緬甸產業經濟之概况如次：緬甸為世界著名產米，產麻，栗樹，鑛產物之國，尤其鑛物鉛鋁錫鎢等軍需資源極為豐富，惜向來為英印殖民政策所妨害，未能開發，以故迄今猶未脫却原始產業之狀態，但一旦具有技術與資本，則立即能開發，此乃緬甸產業經濟之特殊性。現在吾人所當注目者，為緬甸正努力使其產業經濟亦行獨立，因此，日本之加强對緬交易關係與積極輸出技術資本，實乃緬甸巴莫行政長官以下朝野人士正切望者，自然，决戰下之今日，因輸送力之關係，實現此舉相當困難，甚至被認為不可能。但克服此種困難，指導援助緬甸產業經濟，使其作完全獨立之發展，亦正為東亞盟主日本之義務。又現在緬甸衣料頗感缺乏，殊有以土　棉諜自足自給之必要，此外，緬甸正切望自日輸入技術資本如建造木船，修浚港　，加强水陸交通及水利發電事業，與夫採鑛製油等，在在有日緬合作之必要。</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　日內閣情報局第三部碳野對外報道踝長，曾於十日下午會見中滿新聞記者團，特就印督府無條件釋放甘地翁事，發表談話如次：當茲印·緬國境戰况愈益熾烈，印度民衆反英情緒日昻，多數印人，對印度臨時政府懷抱好感，幾多印兵先後參加國民軍陣營之際，敵英竟於驚慌無策之餘，乃行無條伴釋放甘地。吾人就其釋放動機更加檢討，機可以下述兩點說明，即全印民衆皆視甘地翁為印度之救星，而敬之如神，甘地今已年高體衰，一旦不測病死獄中，則全印國民必於憤恨之餘，齋向敵英大興問罪之師，逍究其責。故敵英為懼萬一，乃出以斯策。其二，因日·印同盟軍刻已節節迫近德里，全印國民頗形動搖，參加印度國民軍者，逐日激增，敵英爲防萬一，乃無條防釋放甘地，以阻止全印民衆之動搖。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹軸心軍　作充分準備　南綫大戰最近將展開</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德·羅軍自塞把斯托波爾撤退後，東綫戰局更進入新階段。德軍當局十日就今後戰局解說應注意之各點如次：北起芬蘭灣，南至黑海之東部戰綫，主要戰塲刻仍處平靜狀態中，但此種狀態恐難持久，蘇軍予最近將來，殊有對南部戰綫德軍陣地，開始攻擊之可能性。綜合各方面傳來之情報，衆信蘇軍在南部戰綫以外各戰綫，亦將開始攻勢，就戰略止觀察，可想見蘇軍正企圖以塞把斯托波爾，奧迪薩兩港，爲黑海艦隊及空軍之基地，以對巴爾幹各國加強壓迫。同時，更企圖由喀爾巴阡東部，向巴爾幹中央部展開大攻勢。路透社莫斯科特派員曾報稱：蘇軍司令部刻正　且巴爾幹。但巴爾幹之德重等軸心軍若干師，已有充分準鑼，蘇軍苟開始對巴爾幹之攻勢，必須展開空前之　戰。</p>

<h3>美國援渝　純爲惡意陰謀　日陸軍報到部發言人談</h3>
<p>日駐華上海陸軍部報道部發言人，於昨在報道常會席上，對最近渝美間之政治經濟動向·闡述　詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>犧牲渝方以區自存</p>
<p>渝方行政院參事張平羣，以政府發言人資格，於上月二十六日舉行之記者例會中，對記者團提出之疑問，即「美國對華之援助，在過去二年甲、未能謂為充分，今後亦無迅速增加之望，然則我方之「抗戰」將繼續至於何時」？以極其沉軍之語氣，答以「中國當初決意」抗戰」時，並未有同盟國之存在，中國在未有任何外部援助之希望前，早已獨立的在作戰了，」在此一問一答中，我們可以明白，　對於繼續抗戰有何意義，發生疑問者，不僅我和平區民衆，即抗戰區民衆亦然。　中國民衆及政府，在抗戰之初，抱有將來必得英美援助的依賴心，實屬無可諱言。　及至今日，始由政府聲明，抗戰之初，絕無與他國結盟之預定，尤不作外來援助之夢想，此項聲明，適足表明民衆對美之援助，發生疑問，重慶政府對美國之援助，已非常失望，美國對華之援助，在此次事變中，一直未有切實積極的表明，直至大東亞戰發生，太平洋上與日屢戰屢敗，始欲以中國大陸，為進攻日本本土之據點，作種種發動之所謂對華援助者，係欲在山窮水盡時，藉犧牲他人，以作反攻，以圖自存，此陰謀至最近始為渝方揭穿。渝外次吳國楨，對此更發深刻之譏刺，謂中日事變發生之初，英美對我戰力，作過小之評價，採冷淡之態度，及大東亞戰發生，珍珠灣慘敗以後，對我方之抗戰，遽作賞讚，博我歡心，此種譏刺語，即表示中美今日之合作，已至貌合神離之程度。美國在表面上為强化反軸心陣綫，內心則急欲藉中國大陸作戰塲，發動對日反攻。在重慶表面上，為敷衍所謂「盟國」，內心則深感「盟國」之援助，在此中日事變中，毫無意義可言，更恐懼為其惡意利用，故吳國楨特又鄭重指出，中國為中國之獨立自由而戰，此種目的，始終朱變，即將介石在「論中國之命運」中，亦首先提出中國必須自力更生，以警惕國人奮起。</p>
<p>擊破美國陰謀野心</p>
<p>中美政治關係之最近傾向如此，反顧日本此次在河南之作戰，則充分表明，僅欲擊破美國之以中國土地，中國人民爲　性，而發動對日反攻之以某野心，換言之，今日日本雖在中國大陸作戰，其實質上之敵人，決非渝軍，而實為英美在華之侵略勢力，此點渝方，要亦了然於胸，故最近渝方要人之政論，始有如上述之不情再三申論中國之企求，爲　由獨立及中國必須自立更生。我人希望渝方對英美于之侵華野心，時存戒備，尤望日本在華之作戰，將以急轉直下之勢，改換其性格，一變而為助渝驅逐一切外國之侵略勢力，以奠定東亞水久和平之基礎。</p>
<p>渝美經濟關係惡化</p>
<p>中美關係巾，不祗美國在華之政治行動，使渝方感到在此次事變中，一無是處、而美國在華之經濟攪亂，尤使渝方煩惱業生。現在且看最近美國在渝方之　亂經濟行為，駐渝美空軍及其他關係人員，最近頗見增加，其他軍車外交新聞通信關係人員，①頻頻往來，於是重慶昆明桂林等地，由彼等帶來了巨額金元。最初美空軍，且睹在美國化一元可購得之物品，在重慶　須化上二百五十元法幣或甚至化三百元尙難購得，所以美空軍這時也有其不平與苦痛之處，時重慶方面一般投機商人，正熱中於金公債與關金之段機，見此等買人，各　美金巨款而來，遂起而搜求，以作他們投機之對象，太來金公債與關金，雖均以金元為本位，尙不能直接在巿面流通，今則金元直接而來，遂使重慶商人，一律將彼等之遊資，集中於此金元投機，一方美人携來美金，雖有對法幣之官定換算率即一對耳〇，而實際法幣之購買力，在美人視之，維以二〇〇倍之，尙嫌其微，於是成不願以官定率掉換，任一般商人搜求，金元之墨市，即田此暴漲至二百數十元，結果一般民衆，對於舊法幣覺其信用掃地，政府亦明知而急起努力收拾，然已覺晚矣，而物價統制，亦終歸失敗。本年三月八日行政院參事張平羣，發表批發物價指數，為戰前之二百三十倍，米煤則與去年年底相比，已高六成，火柴則為戰前之六百倍，土布為三百四十倍。</p>
<p>渝方金融陷於混亂</p>
<p>此物價暴漲之原因，實即為美金黑市之猖獗，美國之此種毒物勢力之侵入，使重慶注力最多，關心最重之金融國策，陷於混亂，物價則漲無止境，塗炭民衆，莫此爲甚。</p>
<p>最近在中慶，甚至有如此怪現狀，即一般人對美金生活者·最覺羡慕，而稱之為新買辦階級，如重慶美國新聞處所僱用任妙寫印刷之最低級人員，月薪可得百元美金，向黑市掉換可實得舊法幣一萬八千元，如此高價，雖政府之特任官亦無之，無怪其爲衆人所羡矣。</p>
<p>官方對法定換算率，明知不能滿足駐華美空軍人員之享受與購買慾，特設補助制度，然仍不能阻止眞以金元直接交與墨市商人，於是金融混亂，物價狂漲，孔祥熙爲此對策之硏究，特於三月間飛昆，歸來即立時公佈禁止美金元之流通，並取締彈壓黑市交易，其狼狽可知，亦可見最近在渝方表現的中美經濟關係之惡化。</p>
<p>綜觀重慶方面之中美關係，推測其將來，則必如外此吳國偵所說，美國在珍珠港慘敗後始知同情中國之抗戰，賞議中國之抗戰，反之，一朝能整備反攻，略有端倪，說稍換已往之頹勢，則不知又將重慶置於何地。最近美國內對重慶種種非難與政擊，即已　出英美對重農之看法，重又歸於冷靜·且一切現實，亦只使　等感到幻滅之悲哀而已，至於提供此種非難與攻擊之資料者，實爲駐渝方外人新聞記者，彼等自己造成之重慶物價，今則自受其苦，因受苦又使他們向本國提供攻擊重慶之材料，其卑鄙可知，而重慶一般則苦矣。</p>

<h3>現階段的四　大戰線戰局</h3>
<p>印緬戰綫　一中部戰區　日軍精銳兵團五團，在瑪尼普爾平原進行大殲滅戰。伊姆法爾總攻擊大體分如次三路巡攻：</p>
<p>（甲）三月二十八日，在密勛截斷伊姆爾·哥希馬大道的部隊，回伊姆法爾南下。</p>
<p>（乙）達姆西北方的有力部隊，跟踪追擊敗退十敵，絡續北上進擊</p>
<p>（丙）擊潰頓扎恩區域敵區八之部隊，四月三日在頓扎恩北方突破國境，繼續北上向頓扎恩，伊姆法爾大道進攻。這樣，日軍從三方面包　敵人，第四軍主力的二一個師，即將潰減。</p>
<p>二·北部戰區日陸軍航空部隊與地上部隊協力對緬甸北部加隊附近的敵力空輸挺身隊縮小其包團圈，因此猛攻，敵力漸呈支離滅裂之態</p>
<p>三·南部戰區在加拉頓溪谷擊滅敵西非第八十一師之日印同盟軍，會合從哈加猛進中之有力軍，以吉大港爲目標，而欲突人孟加拉州。</p>
<h3>中太平洋</h3>
<p>三月十九日，美國有力激動部隊來展日加羅林羣島南方海面，爲日海軍航空隊擊毀戰艦四艘，峯沈巡洋艦而艘，此己如大本營發表。但尼米資對中部太平洋戰局之反攻，今後勢將繼績不已。</p>
<p>對此，日海軍之邀擊戰，將隨時隨地使之出血</p>
<p>由華盛頓返任珍珠島的美國太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資稱：「余等作戰目標之一，用潛水艦威脅日本給蓋綫。攪亂日軍兵站的結果，爲今後作戰成否之關鍵。」</p>
<p>所以敵人的企圖，强化游擊戰，增加日方的消耗，一面並增强西南的從夏戚夷經已爾米拉菲尼克斯—草一阿—菲奇到所羅門的補充綫，及中部從百夏威夷經尼克斯，吉爾伯特到馬紹兩，或從夏威夷經中途島到馬紹爾州則補充綫，獲得有利態勢，然後使有力激動部隊一舉出擊，經內南洋，菲島方面，而欲打開積斷中部太平洋的走廊。</p>
<h3>德蘇南部戰場</h3>
<p>南部德酥戰綫上德軍的最右翼在尼古拉愛夫，最左翼爲果威利。從尼古拉愛夫到倍爾伙瑪伊斯克的二百五十公里爲右冀戰區；由此經貝薩拉比亞的巴爾泰，渡杜尼愛斯特爾河，達巴爾奇，經齊爾諾維奇，果洛米亞，斯泰尼斯拉伏斯至泰諾波里的五百公里爲中央戰區，從泰諾波里到果威利的三百公里爲左翼戰區。</p>
<p>蘇軍在這右翼戰區配以瑪利諾夫斯基的第）二島克爾制軍中央部配以果納夫的第而島克蘭軍，左翼配以巨哥夫的第一島克爾軍，正在攻擊中。這三戰綫中最重要的是中央戰區中介於杜尼愛斯特爾，布爾脫兩河中間的區域。蘇軍拔巴爾奇，一部渡布爾脫河，向羅馬尼亞平原進擊，又德軍撤退齊爾諾雜契後，蘇軍直衝喀爾巴阡山麓的果洛米亞，進向倫具爾。</p>
<p>蘇軍的目標，在攻略羅馬尼亞油田地帶，包圍島克闌戰綫德軍。但德國對此早有準備，派軍進駐洪牙利，新銳部隊在喀爾巴阡山脈嚴陣以符，協力洪羅兩軍，準備迎頭痛擊</p>
<h3>義戰區與第二戰綫</h3>
<p>因蘇軍在德蘇戰綫南部區域的進出，蘇聯乃乘巴爾幹諸國動搖的）機會，從事赤化的政治工作。</p>
<p>但德軍進駐洪牙利後，即帶除反側，並與羅馬尼亞保持密切聯絡·調整與保加利亞及土耳其的關·德國在巴爾幹的　　係乃安加答石。</p>
<p>而呼應蘇軍南下至義大利戰綫·則完全停頓。</p>
<p>納吐諾，安奇奧及卡西諾開區域依然在德軍的手裏，尤其在卡西諾戰區，英美軍反因德軍的猛攻而後退至於第二戰綫的登陸地點，亦有種種傳說。最可能的是北法ABCD海岸區域，及從義大利戰綫渡阿得里亞海侵入舊南斯拉夫的達爾瑪提亞海岸。</p>
<p>但義大利戰議有凱塞林元帥率領下的德軍二十五師阻止敵人。巴爾幹有十八師精銳在萊愛爾空軍大將指揮下嚴陣以待。所以敵方希望從義大利戰綫開關第二戰線，不管其時期如何，極少成功的希望。（翔：譯自四月十九日朝日畫報，原圖見下方）</p>
<h3>蘇門答臘　防禦一斑</h3>
<p>火燄樹開着鮮紅的花朵，穿過綠蔭的灌木林的時候，已望見了　　的海了。由某地動身凡數日間，才來到了海岸綫。午後二時抵某地參觀蘇門答臘禦陣容，不知名　的蔓草長有大人一般高，在此夢草發生中，鑿開砂濱或岩地等，完成鞏固陣地，實令人驚嘆。可以抵住若干公斤的直擊炸彈的鞏固陣地，僅在這地區亦不計其數，不似在海岸綫，其背後的丘陵地帶，　完成了同樣的陣地。在遙望右方的突角上，也構　着優秀陣地，記者從此陣地上了歸路，這路的兩傍有田地。這是由原往民耕作的。</p>
<p>得該房面守備部隊的岩崎副官的韓旋，參觀這地帶的防禦狀况，這方面的防禦陣地，和這數日來所見聞的同樣優秀。要空完或這種優秀的陣地，據說亦頗費苦心。另外尚要對猛獸與瘧疾，特別的加以注意。猛獸之王可稱爲虎，蘇門答臘全島中，這個地帶特別的多，並且有魚，野猪，及看食野豬的錦蛇等算當之多·有一個兵士把原住民常用的虎弈，再加以研究改良做了新的陷弈，生擒一隻猛虎。又有一個上等兵在密林中撲殺一隻離魚，帶間來作爲土產。又有某部隊的兵士在密林巾行軍之時，將正吃着野豬不能動的大錦蛇不費力加以述捕，這些事情並不稀罕的（弘謮自四月十八日謮買報知）</p>
<h3>登陸戰的準備</h3>
<p>反軕心軍在四歐登陸作戰，爲期已近，這種呼聲，最近甚囂塵上。至於登陸的時間·地點·規模等，敵方似在頻頻協議中。美國「赫普斯雜誌最近一期，截有「登陸作戰的準備」一文，其中舉北之役（前年冬至去年春）為例，而就「部隊編制」方面，對登陸戰的復雜和困難，有所論列茲節譯如下：</p>
<p>登附戰在特定時限，向特定地點，絕不費戰爭資材中實行·在那次北非戰役中，反軸心軍首腦部舉行會議，選定北非海岸三處地點，（後改爲十二地點），協議同時登陸。第一次美國遠征軍的登陸日期預訂爲十一問，這是一九四二年初夏決定的，自決定至實行，其間相隔約四個月。要實行大規模的近代侵攻戰，這種準備乃是必要的。</p>
<p>作戰計劃</p>
<p>第一，軍事當局必須確立全面的作戰計劃，故美國陸軍的各辦公室中·許多的將校們，夜以議日的舉日會議，反覆論戰。其次爲決定使用部隊的兵力和兵科，由地上部隊·航空部隊·特種部隊之兵力的決定上，決定其　　的福制配合的計算。以地上部隊爲例，其兵力如何大小，非與對空部隊和機械化部隊配合不可·其配合的比例，業須適合登陸地點的各種狀况。</p>
<p>戰門部隊</p>
<p>復次爲對於第一綫戰門部隊，將以何種特別部隊配合的問題。此一問題在北非戰役中，爲了架橋，而設的鐘道部隊，爲負傷者而設的醫療部隊。此事決定之後，陸軍部及作戰軍事當局確定出動部隊。</p>
<p>但在作戰計劃的全段階中，部隊裝備，個人裝備及其補給，爲最重要的問題。</p>
<p>個人裝備</p>
<p>參加北非作戰士兵個人的裝備，自刀槍以至粗布襪子，超過十五種，被服之頰達三百九十種。通信部隊所需的各種資材如無綫電機，電話機，電綫等等，達一萬種。醫療部隊的必需品，達六萬八千種。技術部隊所需的架橋材料，掘擊器·戰關車燈，約十萬種。關於兵器的戰車，大砲，彈業，預備品等各色各樣物品與資材，約二十五萬種。</p>
<p>一個部隊消費的汽油量，較前次大戰時同樣兵一力的部隊，增加八十倍。北非登陸各師團一週間的消費，計汽油四百二十萬加耑，食糧二千萬磅，被服，裝備品爲三千七百萬磅，個人裝備亦較前次大戰時坩加五倍，全兵科的兵士個人裝備合計七十萬種</p>
<p>北非登陸時，運輸船所裝貨物，　個士兵的裝備佔據容積六噸，他如每　的食　，衣服，彈　等，須各補給一噸。</p>
<p>船　載適當的時間，適當的　所赴援，是重大問題之一，爲此輸送系的將校門，必須費數週的時間，苦心注意於船船生產和輸送計劃方案。（譯自四月十八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 爛石</p>
<p>我躺在，一條翳暗的走廊中底角洛裏。我熱得發燒幾乎透不出氣來。那走廊上過路的人在不整齊的地板上行定發出來沉重的脚步聲，打擊在我創痛的心裘，不覺地倦了，昏了，暫時失去了知覺，合上了疲乏的眼皮。</p>
<p>「他媽的，小赤佬，病沒生着，就睡到了，到真舒服。」</p>
<p>「是的，他到這裹來，不定定學生意來的，是給他享福來的。」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>那幾句話，突然地把我驚醒了，張開眼睛望着剛在說我壞話的人，不是誰願來是二個帥兄。心裹一寬疲乏地又閉上了眼睛。</p>
<p>醒來的時假已傍晚了，肚子嘰嘰咕咕的呌着，好像催促着着快把食物裝了進去。不得已只好勉强的爬了起米，不知一站在地上，人就七昏入倒上輕下重站不穩了，爲了吃飯，不得不慢慢的依靠着牆壁鍍進到客堂中去。</p>
<p>客堂一中，巳坐滿了人在吃飯，我仍舊在我平時的坐位上坐下，上而的大一綫鄙的眼光，但是我不管，只是將飯吃了下去，可是吃了半碗就吃飽了。餘儘下的半碗不得不勉强了下去。</p>
<p>「生病，生病，吃得下飯，生什麼病呢？」師兄喃喃的不平地說着，但是我不管他怎麼說，只是把這一碗飯裝到肚子去了。</p>
<p>吃好了飯，人就不對了，忽然一陳冷從人體裹發了出來，人就顫顫地抖着，剛在吃下去的飯，也直吐了出來。頭上一犖，不覺地一眼化，人就站不住了，只好仍舊回到走廊上去睡。</p>
<p>午夜醒來的時候，發覓旁邊有人在說着。</p>
<p>「明天告訴先生，生病，生病，生甚慶病呢？</p>
<p>「是的，好，讓小赤佬知道我們的利害，哈哈哈……。」道二句話明明是二備師兄對我說的。</p>
<p>在第二天午後，人經熱得發燒的時候，師弟跑了來對我說：</p>
<p>「阿桂哥，先生呌你去。」</p>
<p>「我聽見了先生呌我去的話，」心裏就跳過不定，好似犯了甚麼法般的去受法官底判決：要逃避却逃避不得，只好站了起來到賬房間去聽那嚴厲的判決。跑進了賬房問，第一句就對我說。病！」</p>
<p>「是的，先生」我淡然的回答。</p>
<p>「快一星期了。」我直截的回答，接着說：「先生我就會好的。」因爲恐怕遭受到他的罵所再加一句。</p>
<p>「痴孩子，自然會好的，但是這裹空氣不好，地方又小，你自己生着病有不方便，如國這裏有親戚的話，還是到親戚家去住幾日，好時再來。」先生的幾句話多的動聽呀　但是實在却判決了我的死判，我沒有回答，推出了賬房間，回到了我睡的地方躺下，不知甚麼思想打擾了我，不能使眼睛閉上，心裏像火在燒；頭上像鐵錘在敲着，燕哀的，憤怒的……從心底發了出來，總諭講出了一句話：</p>
<p>「你們，這般魔……鬼要要……要逼死我嗎？」結果一陣頭暈，昏沉把我帶走了，帶走到子里的濃霧中去。</p>
<h3>代筆的話</h3>
<p>— 徐如迅</p>
<p>我的名字呌做「筆」　可憐又復可憾，我是一個連自己的父母都不知道的孤兒，當然更不會有什麼姓氏里第。倒是人類的往事，我卻耳然能祥，雅有記載。真所謂「其爲人太多，其自爲太少。</p>
<p>無聲地養下以後，再渾渾噩噩的過了許多年，我便在蔆擾的　發中，覓到了萬一個撫育我的恩入，那就是秦代的蒙活將軍。他在南征楚國的一次狩　中，偶然發見獸類的細毫，大可以陶冶我的性行，增富我的營養，充官我的「筆生」，於是揀選了兔鹿毫的精品，載回京去束帶受封，慘漠精英的把我革新一番，賦予我以新的生命。對於他這種苦心孤詣的謝忱·眞非我自已與還先生所能形容的。　着惡運以外地降臨了：我竟然渝寫別人的　取趨。食婪的秦始皇，波累了我的孤高；他儼然主子般地奴役着我，詔書律令——！一切殺人的魔鬼——都非我操勞頒行不可。在敢怒小敢言的情狀下，我終於做了一次文化的創子手，這是我的奇　大辱！</p>
<p>我暫時沈默了·黑暗的統治也不能久長。之後我父埋首在修身養心的生活中了。除去剛潔的鋒尖，該身的盔套外，更配上桿竹製的長冠外直中空，亭亭玉立，我愈覺自已的淸雋拔俗。這時我開始接觸到人類的歷史，我明白遠在周朝末年，中國的至聖先師孔夫子會經則筆一削過春秋，我將引此爲我初出茅慮的第一功。</p>
<p>魏靑六朝是中國書法的登峯造極時期，也定定唯美文學之花的怒放時期，這兩重高潮的交流，匯成了我靑春的黃金時期。吮着　墨的乳汁，沐着硯的茲潤，我變得益發壯健飽滿，活潑恣肆，馳騁在雪白的紙陣上，真有些風雲際會，激勗凌的氣概。我尤其感到知遇的，是將鼎大名的右車王羲之了。他體貼我，地善視我，他珍用我；他懷着得天獨厚的稟資，耗去數十寒暑研摹的苦功，憑着我的大的能耐，發揚出書聖萬丈的光芒，穩穩地踏上了藝術的星座。</p>
<p>我的英姿，後來又盛召了一個忠實的伙伴：唐朝的大懦兼古文家韓昌黎先生。他爲我作了一篇小傳——毛穎傳，賜姓冠名，數典記祖，雖說是遊戲文章，然而一登龍門，倒着實增重了我的身價。</p>
<p>流光的疾駛，使我一直在飛躍的突進中。應着時代的開展，物質的演化，人類社會的耍求，我的品類就日見繁複了。及至門戶開放，歐風東漸，革命的警鐘，營徹獷個古老的大地，噢醒了醉生夢死的一羣；泥舊有所不能，新的轉變卻催促我萬生各式各樣鮮美的細咆。我重新跨出巨開的步伐·理智地跳上了國際的舞台，較之其他演員，非但毫無愧色·反而因爲我保持住傳統的優質，剛柔互濟地施展了不凡的身手。縱橫在世記的項點，府察着文　的領域，四顧之下，我不禁爲之躊躇滿志了。</p>
<p>世界在創新，時或也在毀滅；文化在日明，時或也在衰敗，歷史在發展·時或也在倒退。這不該是我的錯失吧？我已經獻出賣貴的一生，爲天地崇高的理想，竭盡可能的勞力·　榨亁最後的一滴血了。　爲「萬物之靈」的人類。又怎能辭其咎呢？</p>
<h3>風箏</h3>
<p>— 曹余訓</p>
<p>—誰到閒情拋棄久，每到春來，調　還依售。</p>
<p>春風又拂遍了天涯地角，一連是晴郎的日子。傍晚的時分；在一崖邊的荒塲上，常可以看到三五成羣的孩子們，跳　着；亂　着夕陽的影十。他們仰而向着火空，天空上是幾隻簡單的紙　兒？紙鳶趁着較風，飄湯着，　動着；孩子們拍手着，哄笑着。</p>
<p>我天田完了公事回來，當是在道旁徘徊，瞧他們做這個玩意；—而回憶又是這麼的惆悵。</p>
<p>像眼前的這　孩子一這樣的答眞無邪，也會玩着樣的火眞無邪，也會玩，而且會做，—折　子，秽架，糊紙。特別是敏，他有聰明的本領，巧妙地　出蝴蝶式的老鷹式的樣十米，並且在紙寫上面舉上適宜的橡皮帶；這用樣，島十飛到天空，就會發出　鳴的當聲。於是火家高興地拉了綫，在陌陌上奔跑，蹤跳，直到夕陽　進了山谷，大家總　　地收拾回家。</p>
<p>由此，我和敏就成了親密的朋友。敏不單是總明的孩子·在學校裏，他還是個好學生。他的家境很不好，他不能專心於讀書，淸晨，他得帮助他了親背犁十，把牛牽到山上，之後才到學校裏。但先生們却因此更看重了他。</p>
<p>不記從那天起，敏忽然不來校了。放學後，我們的一看　集在草地上，也不見敵的影子。</p>
<p>「敵不來了！」小朋友們惋借地說。我拿着他　裂的紙　更是悵然若失</p>
<p>又過了數天，我又在田間放紙鳶，突然發見敏跟着他的爸在大路上走，我騰　地，高喊着奔到他的面前。</p>
<p>「敏，你幹嗎不上學去？」</p>
<p>「敏不再讀書了，現在也得到西村去替人家看牛，隔幾天回來跟你玩吧。」回答的却是敏的爸，一個　實的中年人，臉上堆着勉强的笑。「啊！真的嗎？」我驚詫地。</p>
<p>數不說話，點了點頭。我正右許多話跟他訴說，—譬如那隻紙　斷了一根骨十，要他修理；還右……，可是看着他　　　喪着的臉，我　住了。未後，我握住他的手：「敵！你幾時能再來？」</p>
<p>「恐怕……他感動地望着我，「我懊惱呢，以前爲什麼這樣愛玩，不肯好好用功；現在可沒有讀書的機會了。」</p>
<p>同情的悲哀與自訟的慚愧襲上了我的心，我更能說些什麼呢？在靜默中，大家揮着手分別了。我日送他父子倆的背影在夕陽光中消失。</p>
<p>接着，我　鄉來滬讀書，一直沒有得到他的消息過；後來，我也受了戰事與疾病的影響，不得巳中輟了學業；我　跡在這污濁的商塲中、飽嘗着人生的　味。</p>
<p>舊友的　念，失學的惆悵，時常交織着灰色的心緒。我看到這羣玩紙　葛的孩十們，我想起敏，我想起了敵的話：</p>
<p>「……以前我爲什麼愛玩·不肯好好用功；現在可沒有　書的機會了！」（酬移貨學）</p>

<h3>評中北仁决戰球藝餘</h3>
<p>全滬公開籃球賽申組總決賽，中北對仁餘之戰，於十日（星期三）晚上八時半在中靑健身房舉行。全部收入，除原額每券四十元以外，悉充本報助學金（門票二百元）。並爲增厚義款起見，賽至中途由本報陳社長主持拍賽義球，公記以十五萬元之鉅款購得，開拍賣籃球之新紀錄。公記之熱忱，實使全人等代全體淸寒學子致敬。是日盛况空前，球賽亦精彩非凡，結果中北賴經驗豐富，終以三十六對三十五勝一分。茲記者其盛况及評中北仁餘兩隊之作戰焉。</p>
<h3>中北經驗豐富卒能榮獲錦標</h3>
<p>綠中北隊素來作風，以迅速見長，唯是戰亦以穩健爲主；然頗見生疏，以致未能書善盡美。而李震中之在十餘分鐘時，即受三次犯規，以致英雄少用武之力，難免遜色。然震中並不以此而改變作風，特別謹慎從事，得能作戰到底，誠戰士應有此種涵養功夫。不然，中北因震中之罰出而不堪設想也。中北守衛以人釘人爲主，釘得未見高妙，尤以李賽中之不能遏止林維聰爲進襲。而以沈韋恭爲獲分之鑰，尚能未失所望。聿恭不負衆望，有射必中，實爲奠定勝局之大功臣也。最值得一提者，中北在落後九份（卅二—廿三）時，全隊將士，並不慌張，舊勇以往，終得轉敗爲勝。此實爲經騐關富。如易以費格尚淺之隊，必致一厥不振矣。照個人技術而論，中北應勝，照斯戰過程而言，中北之勝，不無偉運。茲者中北已奪得全滬冠軍，且爲本報助學金義賽努力，至堪我人慶賀者。</p>
<h3>仁餘打來佳妙惜罰球少命中</h3>
<p>是晚仁餘諸將，打來頭頭是道，有聲有色，進攻時左右二鋒深入兩角，中鋒兀立對方籃下，兩衛在外循環傳球，覓隙偷襲。退守則採用五人聯防法，協力阻擋，絕不放鬆。此種「穩紮穩打」之戰術，竟使中北大感辣手。余郇子身居統帥，指揮若定，老將風度，的是不凡。卓國榮與馬燦希一剛一柔，鎭靜有加。帶球截球，均具獨到之處，可稱一對「鐵衛」。小將林維聰玲瓏剔透，無孔不入，戴襲射籃，神出鬼沒，與中北之其成就恐不在國手馮念華王鴻斌擊之下，前途正未可限量。李肇和目光近視，吃虧不少，是役動作呆滯，屢誤戎機，爲兩隊中最弱之一員。諒係大敵當前，不無胆怯，當進攻時，恒立震中身後，殊屬失策。設能稍爲活躍，在郇子得球時，迅速趨前，遮住震中，俾郇子能乘問投藍，則獲分必多，制勝可期。該隊罰球太半未能命中，亦爲失敗主因。當三十四對三十四平局時，中北隊員犯規，郇子罰球兩記，如皆擲中，則超前兩分，雖聿功扳回一球，仍成平手，而時間即將告終·在延長比賽中，尚可一決雌雄，正未知鹿死誰手。惜乎僅中其一，而時不我待，　聲鏜然，反以一分見屈，亦云慘矣，觀乎此戰過程，仁餘屢佔上風。下半時中最大差數爲三十二對二十三，領前九分券。是時設能把持勝局，反攻爲守，採用延宕戰備，疲球後勿輕脫手，引誘敵方前來刦奪，以便乘處而入，則必勝無疑。乃計不出此。以郇子資格之老，竟亦未能隨機應變，一着手失，飮恨終身，此天亡我歟？抑戰之罪歟？深盼仁餘諸將，毋怠毋餒，再接再厲，來日方長，有厚望焉·而承該隊爲本報義賽作戰，同致銘謝！</p>
<h3>東華　兩戰傑作</h3>
<p>東華隊本屆出師以來，逢敵不摧，威聲四播，最近二過又得二塲傑作。記者欣慰之餘，略作評述，以留紀念云爾。</p>
<h3>代表中華隊　克服葡萄牙</h3>
<p>前星期日（四月卅日）我中華隊在跑馬廳足球傷與葡萄牙爭奪國際盃足球決賽權，慶戰結果，我華隊賴三軍用命，舊其神威，卒以二比一擊退頑敵，逼訂域下之盟，連接三屆宿仇，雪於一旦，揚眉吐氣，克償所願，誠快事也。無怪萬餘球迷，如醉如狂，呼聲雷動，響澈雲齊。並有人燃放爆竹，以示慶祝。其歡欣歌舞之情，實非楮筆所能形容。是日我華隊出塲陣綫，係爲淸一色之東華隊。聯絡方面，較爲純熟，進攻退守，有條不紊。加以東華對，聲勢之狀，精神之旺，正如旭日方中，不可一世·此次身臨大敵，義無反顯，更抱沉舟破釜之决心，不掃匈奴，誓在生還。以此之故，葡萄牙雖屬頑强，安得不敗哉。</p>
<p>是役也，兩隊動作淸晰，均能注意運動道德，而得充分發揮其優良球藝，尤值得秉筆一害。而比賽過程，驚心動魄，則無時無刻不在　風駭浪之中。邇時記者月眩神迷，甚至呼吸急促，緊張之情，達於極點。待我隊以二對一獲得勝局時，胸間如釋重壓，呼吸得徐徐恢復常態。</p>
<p>談兩隊作風，均以細膩見長，無大刀闊斧之將工，盡細巧傳遞之能事。故戰來如膠如漆，難解難分，我華隊之所以取勝，有其成功之所在焉。</p>
<p>我中華隊是日所採守衛，以人釘人爲旨，後衛守敵兩翼。前衛釘敵兩內錄中堅，死跟敵中鋒。而是日葡隊攻路滿擬用兩翼包抄，中央突破之策。按葡隊之石翼勝於左翼，而其石翼適逢我隊長李寗，於是彼一籌莫展矣。敵左再敵所賴中央突破者大蟲法凡笑，而法則為我上將鐔福楨及張林根輪流死守。職斯之故，葡隊之攻勢，　成功虧一簣。至評羣隊進攻之策，亦用於兩翼之急進，韓龍海至鼠進爲主，以此屢能有威脅之鏡頭。隆海更能一如鄙人所言，注意越位，故成功極多。敵隊受盡吃駑，我人當可回憶及之。而兩翼幼良李垚之能及早傅中，最爲可取。蓋敵方守衛，球路純熱，非此不足以制之業。最後有值得一提之二點：一爲華隊採第三後衛制之美妙。夫第灑三後衛，滬上首創者爲「但維斯」苜試騐者。在我記憶中爲馮運佑，唯所用及所倡者，均以中堅死守後方爲目的，而此次華隊所採第三後衛制，又盡變化之能事·如鐔福楨退後時，張林根隨之坐鎮中央，以助前鋒。反之，張有時退後作第三後衛時，則老鐔恢復原位，二人應付純熟，敵將一時捉摸不定。更必須一提者，是日守門張邦綸有意想不到之絕跡。小張有此收獲，足以豪矣。</p>
<h3>市長盃複賽　再禽警老爺</h3>
<p>上星期日（本月七日）東華與一警作市長盃複賽，東華仔聯賽中會二敗一警，然均在風險中以三對二小勝。而此戰東華發揮威力，乃以三對一取之，使警老爺三度被困，</p>
<p>說者均謂東華之攻勝於守，然鄙人以爲該隊攻守在目下狀態中，絕對平均發展。觀乎李寗莊及仁之遮住球門區域（CoverGoalArea）之守衛，實爲滬上其他各隊所望　莫及，而張邦綸之筆頭日上，迭救險球，攻勳非淺，而其能救出小黃毛之十即東華前鋒極能以已之長，攻人之短，過去所以能屢戰皆勝，即基於此。如此戰東舉多利用中路挺進，射門亦取低球，蓋對方守衛注意東華兩翼。敵方守門，袛善高球，而不能救低球也。以此之故，東華乃得大勝矣。</p>
<p>茲者中華隊已獲得國際盃決賽權，東華隊亦　得市長盃最後關頭，均將進與義大利爭奪星座。本週末（十四日）市長盃先開分曉，深望東華將士，再接再勵，乘勝直轄，一鼓盪平無任　禱！（梅必賢）</p>
<h3>球場麟爪</h3>
<p>中北對仁餘奪戰吿畢，中北指導大胖戴昌敵與小胖徐兆態，擁抱接吻，足見體壞人仕天眞。</p>
<p>中北汪領隊，在該隊落後九分之際，汪君義不容辭，請纓參戰。居然中北獨佔義頭，汪亦足以自慰。</p>
<p>有人替仁餘惋惜，大耗錦標輕易放棄。茍或中北遭失敗，亦必有人代中北抱不平。所以世界上最天真者莫過於球迷。</p>
<p>是晚球場秩序甚佳，足見辦事員制努力·警察守門尤見成績（呂城）</p>

<h3>Reputation First</h3>
<p>There is a common saying, "Don't worry about people not knowing, unless you yourself do something." It means that any secret matter, though subjectively you may think no one knows, will eventually be discovered by people after it is done. Therefore, only by not doing it in the first place will it not be discovered. However, the "doing something" mentioned here, that will always be discovered, does not only refer to bad things. Of course, it also includes good things. Doing good deeds, even if one does not want to be known, will earn people's respect when discovered. Conversely, doing bad things, even if one wants to hide them, will earn people's contempt when discovered. The former enhances one's reputation, while the latter ruins it. Which to abandon and which to follow, we believe everyone has the reason to choose. However, people often overestimate "secrecy," do things that are contemptible, and end up ruining their reputation. This single difference in thought has ruined the reputation of so many people; one must be cautious.</p>
<p>"Corruption" is a disgraceful thing. We can assert that even those who commit corrupt acts understand that they are doing something disgraceful, and they regret it. However, if we further analyze the motivation for corruption, part of it is based on the pressure of life. Although they know that corruption is bad, they cannot resist the pressure of life and take the risk of corruption. This kind of corruption can be said to be "corruption for the sake of life." There is also a part that does not have any problems with life at all, but knowingly engages in corruption. This kind of corruption can be said to be "corruption for the sake of corruption." Compared with each other, they are certainly both disgraceful corruption, but there are some differences in their motivations. Therefore, there are also some differences in the loss of reputation.</p>
<p>Secondly, pursuing speculative profits is also a disgraceful thing. Compared with corruption, it seems to be slightly better objectively. In fact, those who pursue speculative profits inevitably resort to unscrupulous means, disregard the public, harm others for their own benefit, and only seek private gain. Their intention of harming others for their own benefit is no different from that of corruption. Therefore, we can say that profiteers and corrupt people are all destroyers of reputation. If one must measure which is higher or lower, it is simply a matter of fifty steps versus one hundred steps.</p>
<p>For example, Gu Shiheng and Zhou Naiwen, as ministers and vice-ministers, willingly engage in corruption. They did not initially know that it was a disgraceful thing, but mistakenly thought it was secret, and mistakenly believed that their position could cover up everything. After the case was exposed, when Gu's residence was searched, it was said that more than thirty women's fur coats were found. From this, it can be predicted that in the place of wealth, the motivation for corruption is definitely not the pressure of life, but corruption for the sake of corruption. Once they become prisoners, how can they not ruin their reputation?</p>
<p>Also, in the current economic circles of Shanghai, it must be admitted that many people pursue speculative profits unscrupulously, only seeking private gain. As a result, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are stagnated and not on track, gradually leading the entire economy to collapse. The profiteers themselves may think that there is nothing disgraceful about this. However, this is completely an illusion. As mentioned earlier, their intention is to harm others for their own benefit, which is indeed as disgraceful as corruption.</p>
<p>Life should regard reputation as the most important thing. The overturned cart ahead is a lesson not far away. We hope that senior government officials and the upper class in Shanghai's economic circles will cherish and value their reputation, especially in this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, in this time of national survival, think more about the national economy and the people's livelihood, think more about the public interest, and not engage in corruption or speculative profits.</p>
<p>Reputation First! Reputation First!</p>
<h3>A Scene from the Air Battle in Northern Burma - Enemy Super-Heavy Bomber Shot Down -</h3>
<p>On April 26th, the Japanese Air Force shot down an enemy's new type of super-heavy bomber in the mountains of Northern Burma for the first time. The following is a discussion of the fierce battle by Japanese Air Force soldiers who participated in the battle.</p>
<p>Captain Enbe led a plane patrolling at an altitude of about 4,500 meters above the battlefield on this day. Around 12:00, while flying over Bankamba (30 kilometers northeast of Imphal), Lieutenant Kimura, the comrade of Captain Kurosawa, suddenly sent a signal that an enemy plane had been discovered. Looking over, a huge four-engine bomber was flying from the direction of Dunskiya or Digbo about 500 meters above and to the right of the formation, escorted by two fighter planes.</p>
<p>It was a Douglas aircraft. They immediately attacked it together. The escorting fighter planes immediately turned around and fled westward. The remaining large plane increased its speed and tried to escape in its original direction. The Japanese plane pursued closely, and when it reached the airspace of the Arakan Mountains, Captain Nakamura fired the first shot. At this time, the distance was only twenty or thirty meters. The enemy plane fired back wildly from its belly and tail. Captain Nakamura was hit by several bullets fired from the machine guns at the rear of the enemy plane and could only disengage. The enemy is now escaping along the China-India air route all the way to China. Next, Lieutenant Sumino fiercely fired from the front of the enemy, but the fuel had been almost exhausted during the previous patrol. Therefore, they divided into two teams, Captain Kurosawa's team circled to the front, and the rest attacked from the front and rear. All the bullets hit, but the enemy's armor was so thick that, although various parts were riddled with bullets, it continued to fly horizontally at its original altitude as if nothing had happened. It was forced for 450 kilometers from Bankamba and was almost near Fort Hertz in northern Burma. The enemy began to falter, and its massive body gradually became unstable. Lieutenant Sumino added the final blow, and finally black smoke began to billow out, and the inner right engine stopped. The black smoke gradually thickened, and the massive body swayed and fell. At that time, the fuel of each aircraft was almost exhausted, and the engines were burning hot. The entire team then triumphantly returned to base. (Sho; translated from the Asahi Shimbun, May 2)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Ramu Airfield and Bombards Enemy Artillery Positions</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in Burma, in coordination with ground troops, has continued to attack the enemy for days. On the morning of the 10th, they attacked an enemy artillery position in a certain area again. Braving fierce defensive artillery fire, they continuously dropped heavy bombs, causing two fires in the enemy position. Two or three enemy tanks assisting in the battle were also damaged.

<p>Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma, on the morning of the 6th, used a joint formation of fighter-bombers to attack the enemy's position near a certain area.

<h3>Epidemic Spreading in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - The weather in Nanjing has been unstable recently, causing an epidemic. Recently, a strange epidemic has suddenly occurred in the urban area. It has not yet been confirmed what kind of pathogen it is. Patients have headaches and high fevers. Several members of a family become ill at the same time, which proves that the disease is an infectious disease. The Central Hospital has been constantly admitting patients with the disease for treatment. However, except for fever and headache, there have been no deaths as of the 11th. It is said that the disease is transmitted by unclean fish.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Detachment Approaching Luoyang, Expanding Results in the South of the City</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Henan front is still making smooth progress. According to a Chongqing dispatch from the United Press on the 10th, a detachment of the Japanese army, echoing the Japanese army approaching the outskirts of Luoyang, is expanding its results in the southern area of the city.</p>
<p>Deteriorating Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists</p>
<p>Xinzheng, 11th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the front line in Henan on the 11th reports that since the Chongqing army and the Communist army called for a general summer counter-offensive, they have been actively expanding their military preparations. According to reports from prisoners of war here, the 14th Army of Henan moved to Shaanxi on March 17 under orders to blockade the Communist Party. At the same time, the Communist army, under the pretext of a general counter-offensive against Japan, is vigorously building Chen areas in the south of Yan'an and plans to use northern Shanxi, the northern corner of Shaanxi, and the new Yellow River as the last line of resistance in case of failure in operations against Chongqing. Also, the Communist Party seems to be building positions in the western part of the Northwest Military Region. The so-called general counter-offensive against Japan is just a signboard for Chongqing and the Communist Party to strengthen their own forces.</p>
<p>Regarding conscription, it has been implemented simultaneously on both sides since last year, but the results have been quite poor. Even the quality of the soldiers used for the general counter-offensive is very low. Cai Jianming, commander of the 4th Division of the 13th Army of the Chiang system, once had a dream of thorough training and ordered his subordinates to not slacken in the training of soldiers this spring. Another major difficulty in the expansion of the army is the lack of soldiers' salaries and ammunition. The First War Zone once tried to deduct 20% of the soldiers' salaries, claiming it was for a counter-offensive fund, and ordered the return of two-thirds of the existing ammunition for the purpose of the general counter-offensive. It is conceivable that the general counter-offensive is used to cover up the expansion of military preparations and the shortage of materials. In addition, the four major banks in Luoyang—Central, China, Farmers, and Siming—have all been ordered to move to Xi'an due to the plan for the general counter-offensive. It has also been decided that various economic-related agencies will also gradually begin to move. This improper measure of retreating before the battle will only lower the morale of the people resisting the war.</p>
<p>Chongqing Has Not Recognized the Japanese Army's Intentions</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army suddenly launched an offensive in Henan Province, Chongqing fundamentally failed to recognize the Japanese army's intentions. According to a Reuters dispatch, Liang Hancao, Minister of Propaganda of Chongqing, stated when meeting with foreign reporters on the 3rd that the Japanese army's move was an attempt to open up the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the military authorities observed that Luoyang was not the target of the Japanese army. Although the strength of the Chongqing army was not as good as that of the Japanese army, its intelligence was superior to that of the Japanese army, and it was believed that the Japanese army could be repelled. However, as the Japanese army's operations progressed smoothly, Chongqing was shaken. According to a United Press dispatch, Zhang Pingqun, counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, told reporters on the 10th that he hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States would urgently rescue the Chongqing army. According to a dispatch from the Chongqing visitor of the Christian Science Monitor on the 7th, after the collapse of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the Japanese army had begun to advance westward from the Longhai Railway. From a strategic point of view, it was also keenly felt that the Chongqing government urgently needed to be reorganized. The Daily Telegraph on the 9th also wrote an article saying that the Japanese army's operations in Henan Province were progressing very rapidly. In the past three weeks, the Japanese army had advanced a total of more than 300 kilometers in various directions. Although it has not yet been determined whether the Japanese army is aiming at Xi'an, it has been confirmed that the Japanese army intends to use similar blitzkrieg tactics in the Chinese battle line. The current offensive of the Japanese army in Henan Province is fundamentally different from the operations launched by the Japanese army in the spring and autumn seasons of the past four or five years to reconnoiter the military situation of the Chongqing army and ensure resources. It cannot be compared with the battle of Changsha, because the Changsha area is either hilly or swampy and is not suitable for the use of modern weapons.</p>
<p>Judging from the current reality, the U.S. Air Force cannot hold airfields near the battlefield, so it cannot cooperate with the ground forces of the Chongqing army during actual combat. The Japanese army's offensive this time was something that the military authorities of Chongqing and foreign military authorities did not dream of. It also caused great shock within the Chongqing authorities. Sun Ke's recent speech in the Chongqing Legislative Yuan and the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Xi'an are a manifestation of Chongqing's desperation.</p>
<p>Henan Province is the famous Central Plain in Eastern history, and the Japanese and Chongqing armies can gather a lot of weapons here. Therefore, the combat power of the Japanese and Chongqing armies can be clearly understood by observing the progress of this operation. The Japanese army has widely used mechanized forces and is advancing from the Pinghan Railway to Luoyang, making full use of the firepower and maneuverability of mechanical vehicles. In just 20 days, the Chongqing army between the Yellow River and Xinyang was completely wiped out in fact. Also, the New York Times Weekly has reprinted news from Chongqing as follows: Recently, the Japanese army seems to be trying to open up the Pinghan Railway, and the purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Luoyang this time is to protect the main force's operations from the side. It is still impossible to estimate whether the Japanese army will permanently occupy Luoyang this time. In addition, the Chongqing army's operational plan is also very unclear, because the spokesman for Chongqing only said that the Chongqing army did not want to fight along the railway line. However, the Japanese army's first adoption of German-style blitzkrieg made the Chongqing army, which was content with the status quo, panic.</p>
<h3>Abundant Resources in Burma Awaiting Cooperative Development: Advisor Ogawa Speaks in Osaka</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ogawa Gotaro, Japanese economic advisor to the Burmese government, recently returned to the country to discuss important matters. He reported on the general situation of Burmese industry and economy at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Economic Council on the 9th as follows: Burma is a world-renowned country for rice, jute, chestnut trees, and mineral products. In particular, mineral resources such as lead, aluminum, tin, and tungsten are extremely rich in military supplies. Unfortunately, they have been hindered by British-Indian colonial policies and have not been developed. Therefore, it has not yet escaped the state of primitive industry. However, once it has technology and capital, it can be developed immediately. This is the uniqueness of Burma's industrial economy. What we should pay attention to now is that Burma is striving to make its industrial economy independent. Therefore, Japan's strengthening of trade relations with Burma and active export of technology and capital are what the people of Burma, including the head of the Bhamo administration, are eagerly hoping for. Naturally, in today's decisive battle, it is quite difficult, even impossible, to realize this due to transportation capacity. However, it is the duty of Japan, the leader of East Asia, to overcome these difficulties and guide and assist Burma's industrial economy to develop into complete independence. In addition, Burma feels that there is a great shortage of clothing, and it is necessary to be self-sufficient in local cotton. In addition, Burma is eager to import technology and capital from Japan, such as building wooden ships, dredging ports, strengthening land and water transportation and water conservancy power generation, and mining and oil production. There is a need for Japanese-Burmese cooperation in all aspects.</p>
<h3>German Head of State Awards Medal to Marshal Koga</h3>

<h3>German and American Aircraft Dogfight East of the Alps; Italian Front Quiet</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency, according to authoritative sources here, German aircraft intercepted American aircraft in the eastern Alps yesterday morning, and a fierce air battle occurred. The American aircraft suffered heavy losses, and the anti-aircraft artillery was also very active, shooting down several American four-engine bombers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The war situation on the Italian front is quiet. Whether the intensified activities of reconnaissance teams and commando teams in the south and Natuo are a prelude to a large-scale war is still unknown.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: In the fierce air battle over the Alps yesterday, 42 American aircraft were shot down, including 35 bomber aircraft. The German fighter squadron cooperated with the air defense forces to launch a close-range attack on the aircraft squadron. Many American aircraft crashed into the mountains and were destroyed, and the personnel in the aircraft were killed. Some pilots who jumped from the aircraft were rescued by rescue teams.</p>
<h3>British Release of Gandhi Aimed at Suppressing Popular Sentiment: Section Chief Isono's Remarks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Isono, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Cabinet Information Bureau's Foreign Reporting Department, met with the China-Manchukuo press corps on the afternoon of the 10th. He made the following remarks regarding the unconditional release of Gandhi by the Indian Governor-General's office: As the war situation on the India-Burma border intensifies, and anti-British sentiment among the Indian populace rises daily, with many Indians harboring goodwill towards the Provisional Government of India, and with numerous Indian soldiers successively joining the ranks of the National Army, the enemy, Britain, in a state of panic and helplessness, has unconditionally released Gandhi. We can further examine the motivation for this release and explain it in the following two points: First, the entire Indian populace views Gandhi as the savior of India and reveres him like a god. Gandhi is now old and frail. If he were to unexpectedly fall ill and die in prison, the entire Indian nation, in anger and resentment, would surely launch a punitive expedition against the enemy, Britain, to hold them accountable. Therefore, the enemy, Britain, fearing such an eventuality, has resorted to this strategy. Second, as the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces are now steadily approaching Delhi, the entire Indian populace is showing signs of wavering, and the number of those joining the Indian National Army is increasing daily. The enemy, Britain, to prevent any eventuality, has unconditionally released Gandhi in order to stop the wavering of the entire Indian populace.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Committee Holds Symposium</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – In order to launch agricultural production increase efforts within five kilometers along the railway lines, the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan held a symposium this afternoon (11th) at 3:00 PM.

Regarding the production increase plan, the Ministry of Construction's Railway Protection Money Working Committee will invite relevant agencies to discuss and formulate it. The promotion of the work will be mainly based on the relevant agencies, and relevant parties will be invited to assist.</p>
<h3>Balkan Axis Powers Make Full Preparations; Major War on Southern Front Imminent</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Since the German-Romanian forces withdrew from Sevastopol, the Eastern Front situation has entered a new stage. German military authorities on the 10th explained the points to be noted regarding the future war situation as follows: The main battlefield of the Eastern Front, stretching from the Gulf of Finland in the north to the Black Sea in the south, remains calm, but this state of affairs is unlikely to last. In the near future, the Soviet army has the possibility of launching an attack on German positions on the southern front. Comprehensive information from various sources indicates that the Soviet army will also launch offensives on fronts other than the southern front. From a strategic point of view, it is conceivable that the Soviet army is attempting to use the ports of Sevastopol and Odessa as bases for the Black Sea Fleet and Air Force to increase pressure on the Balkan countries. At the same time, it is also attempting to launch a major offensive from the eastern Carpathian Mountains towards the central part of the Balkans. Reuters Moscow correspondent reported that the Soviet command is currently targeting the Balkans. However, several divisions of German and other Axis forces in the Balkans have made full preparations. If the Soviet army launches an offensive against the Balkans, it must launch an unprecedented war.</p>

<h3>US Aid to Chongqing is Purely a Malicious Conspiracy: Spokesman for the Japanese Army Reporting Department Remarks</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Army Reporting Department stationed in Shanghai elucidated in detail on the recent political and economic trends between Chongqing and the United States at yesterday's regular reporting meeting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sacrificing Chongqing to Preserve Self</p>
<p>Zhang Pingqun, a consultant of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, acting as a government spokesman, raised the question to the press corps at the regular press conference held on the 26th of last month, namely, "The United States' aid to China has not been sufficient in the past two years, and there is no hope for a rapid increase in the future. Then, when will our 'resistance' continue?" He answered in an extremely somber tone, "When China initially decided to 'resist,' there were no Allied countries in existence. China was already fighting independently before there was any hope of external assistance." In this question and answer, we can understand that those who question the meaning of continuing the war of resistance are not only the people in our peace area, but also the people in the war zone. It is undeniable that the Chinese people and the government had a reliance on the future aid of Britain and the United States at the beginning of the war of resistance. As of today, the government has stated that there was no predetermined alliance with other countries at the beginning of the war of resistance, and it does not dream of external assistance. This statement is sufficient to show that the people have doubts about the aid from the United States, and the Chongqing government is very disappointed with the aid from the United States. The United States' aid to China has never been practically and actively shown in this incident. It was not until the Great East Asian War broke out and it repeatedly lost to Japan in the Pacific that it wanted to use the Chinese mainland as a base for attacking the Japanese mainland. The so-called aid to China, which was launched in various ways, was intended to sacrifice others and counterattack in order to survive when it was at the end of its rope. This conspiracy was only recently exposed by Chongqing. Wu Guozhen, the Foreign Minister of Chongqing, made a more profound mockery of this, saying that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese incident, Britain and the United States underestimated our combat power and adopted a cold attitude. After the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and the Pearl Harbor debacle, they suddenly praised our resistance and won our hearts. This kind of mockery indicates that today's cooperation between China and the United States has reached the point of being outwardly united but inwardly divided. The United States, on the surface, wants to strengthen the anti-Axis front, but in its heart, it is eager to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield to launch a counterattack against Japan. On the surface, Chongqing is perfunctory to the so-called "Allied countries," but in its heart, it deeply feels that the "Allied countries'" aid is meaningless in this Sino-Japanese incident, and it is even more afraid of being maliciously used by them. Therefore, Wu Guozhen solemnly pointed out again that China is fighting for China's independence and freedom, and this purpose has never changed. Jiang Jieshi also first proposed in "On China's Destiny" that China must rely on its own efforts to alert the people to rise up.</p>
<p>Crushing the United States' Conspiracy and Ambition</p>
<p>The recent trend of political relations between China and the United States is like this. Looking back at Japan's operation in Henan this time, it fully shows that it only wants to crush the United States' ambition to launch a counterattack against Japan by using China's land and Chinese people. In other words, although Japan is fighting on the Chinese mainland today, its real enemy is definitely not the Chongqing army, but the British and American forces of aggression in China. This point is also clear to Chongqing, so the political theories of important Chongqing officials recently began to repeatedly state that China's desire is for independence and that China must rely on its own efforts. We hope that Chongqing will always be wary of the British and American ambitions to invade China, and we especially hope that Japan's operations in China will change its character with a sharp turn, and change into helping Chongqing to expel all foreign forces of aggression in order to lay the foundation for the lasting peace of East Asia.</p>
<p>Deterioration of Economic Relations Between Chongqing and the United States</p>
<p>In Sino-US relations, not only the political actions of the United States in China have made Chongqing feel that it has no use in this incident, but also the economic disruption of the United States in China has made Chongqing more and more annoyed. Now let's look at the recent economic disruption of the United States in Chongqing. The number of US Air Force personnel stationed in Chongqing and other related personnel has recently increased, and other military, diplomatic, news, and communication personnel are frequently coming and going, so they brought huge amounts of gold yuan to Chongqing, Kunming, Guilin, and other places. At first, the US Air Force also saw that the items that could be purchased for one yuan in the United States had to be spent 250 yuan in legal currency or even 300 yuan in Chongqing, so the US Air Force also had its own injustice and pain at this time. At that time, Chongqing's general speculators were enthusiastic about speculating in gold public bonds and customs gold. Seeing these buyers coming with huge amounts of US dollars, they rose up to search for them as the object of their speculation. Taikan Gold Public Bonds and Customs Gold, although based on gold yuan, cannot be directly circulated on the market. Now that gold yuan is coming directly, Chongqing merchants are concentrating their idle funds on this gold yuan speculation. On the one hand, Americans bring US dollars, although there is an official exchange rate for legal currency, that is, one to two, and the actual purchasing power of legal currency is seen by Americans as only 200 times, and they still feel that it is low, so they are not willing to exchange at the official rate and allow general merchants to search for it. The black market for gold yuan has soared to 200 and several dozen yuan, and as a result, the general public feels that the credibility of the old legal currency has been swept away, and the government is clearly aware of it and rushes to clean up, but it is too late, and price controls have also failed. On March 8 of this year, Zhang Pingqun, a consultant of the Executive Yuan, announced that the wholesale price index was 230 times that before the war, and the price of rice and coal had risen by 60% compared with the end of last year, the price of matches was 600 times that before the war, and the price of native cloth was 340 times that before the war.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Finance Falls into Chaos</p>
<p>The reason for this skyrocketing price is actually the rampant black market for US dollars. The intrusion of this poisonous force from the United States has made Chongqing's most effort and the most concerned financial policy fall into chaos. Prices have risen endlessly, and there is nothing more serious than the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Recently, there has even been such a strange phenomenon in Chongqing, that is, the general public is most envious of those who live on US dollars, and they are called the new comprador class. For example, the lowest-level personnel employed by the Chongqing US Information Office to write and print can earn 100 US dollars per month, which can actually be exchanged for 18,000 old legal currency in the black market. Even special officials of the government do not have such a high price, so it is no wonder that they are envied by everyone.</p>
<p>The officials know that the statutory exchange rate cannot satisfy the enjoyment and purchasing desire of the US Air Force personnel stationed in China, so they have set up a subsidy system, but they still cannot prevent the direct exchange of gold yuan with black market merchants, so financial chaos and price increases, Kong Xiangxi specially flew to Kunming in March to study this countermeasure, and immediately announced the prohibition of the circulation of US dollars and suppressed black market transactions, so it can be seen that the economic relations between China and the United States in Chongqing have recently deteriorated.</p>
<p>Looking at the Sino-US relations in Chongqing, and speculating on its future, it must be as Wu Guozhen said, the United States only knew to sympathize with China's resistance and reward China's resistance after the Pearl Harbor debacle. On the contrary, once it can prepare for a counterattack and there is a slight clue that it will change the past trend, then it does not know where it will put Chongqing again. The recent various accusations and attacks on Chongqing in the United States have revealed that the British and American views on Chongong have returned to calm, and all reality has only made them feel the sorrow of disillusionment. As for those who provide the information for this kind of accusation and attack, they are actually the foreign news reporters stationed in Chongqing. They themselves created the prices in Chongqing, and now they are suffering from it. Because of the suffering, they provide materials to their own countries to attack Chongqing. Its meanness can be seen, and the general public in Chongqing is suffering.</p>

<h3>The Current Four Major War Zone Situations</h3>
<p>India-Burma Front - One Central War Zone - Five regiments of the Japanese Army's elite troops are conducting a large-scale annihilation battle on the Manipur Plain. The Imphal general offensive is roughly divided into the following three routes:</p>
<p>(A) The unit that cut off the Imphal-Kohima Road at Michun on March 28th is returning south to Imphal.</p>
<p>(B) A powerful unit northwest of Tamu is tracking and pursuing the retreating enemy, and is successively advancing north.</p>
<p>(C) A unit that defeated eight units of the enemy in the Tunzang area broke through the border north of Tunzang on April 3rd and continued to advance north towards the Tunzang-Imphal Road. In this way, the Japanese army is encircling the enemy from three directions, and the main force of the Fourth Army's 21st Division is about to be annihilated.</p>
<p>Two - Northern War Zone - The Japanese Army Air Force is cooperating with ground units to narrow the encirclement of the enemy's airborne commando near the Jiagada team in northern Burma. Therefore, the fierce attack is gradually disintegrating the enemy's forces.</p>
<p>Three - Southern War Zone - The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces, which annihilated the enemy's 81st West African Division in the Kaladan Valley, have joined forces with the powerful army advancing from Haga, aiming at Chittagong, and want to break into the state of Bengal.</p>
<h3>Central Pacific</h3>
<p>On March 19th, a powerful American mobile unit advanced to the sea south of the Japanese-held Caroline Islands, where Japanese naval air forces destroyed four battleships and sank several cruisers, as announced by the Imperial Headquarters. However, Admiral Nimitz's counteroffensive in the Central Pacific theater will undoubtedly continue.</p>
<p>In response, the Japanese Navy will engage in interception warfare, inflicting casualties at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated upon his return to Pearl Harbor from Washington: "One of our operational goals is to use submarines to threaten Japan's supply lines. Disrupting Japanese military logistics is crucial to the success or failure of future operations."</p>
<p>Therefore, the enemy's intention is to strengthen guerrilla warfare and increase Japanese attrition. Simultaneously, they are reinforcing supply lines from the southwestern United States, passing through Hawaii, Palmyra, Phoenix, Samoa, Fiji, to the Solomon Islands, as well as in the central Pacific, from Hawaii through Nikumaroro, the Gilbert Islands, to the Marshall Islands, or from Hawaii through Midway Island to the Marshall Islands. They aim to gain a favorable position and then launch a powerful mobile unit in one fell swoop, passing through the Inner South Seas and the Philippine Islands, to open up a corridor that cuts across the Central Pacific.</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Southern Front</h3>
<p>On the southern German-Soviet front, the German army's right flank is at Nikolaev, and the left flank is at Kowel. The 250 kilometers from Nikolaev to Pervomaisk constitutes the right flank sector. From there, via Balti in Bessarabia, crossing the Dniester River, reaching Bălți, then through Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, Stanislaviv, to Ternopil, is the central sector, covering 500 kilometers. From Ternopil to Kowel, the left flank sector extends for 300 kilometers.</p>
<p>The Soviet forces have deployed Malinovsky's Second Ukrainian Front in the right flank sector, Koniev's Second Ukrainian Front in the central sector, and Zhukov's First Ukrainian Front in the left flank sector, and are currently attacking. The most important of these three sectors is the central sector, located between the Dniester and Southern Bug rivers. Soviet forces have seized Bălți, with some units crossing the Southern Bug River and advancing towards the Romanian plains. After the German retreat from Chernivtsi, Soviet forces are directly advancing on Kolomyia at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, heading towards Lunghin.</p>
<p>The Soviet objective is to capture the Romanian oilfields and encircle the German forces on the Ukrainian front. However, Germany has prepared for this, deploying troops to Hungary, and deploying new elite units in the Carpathian Mountains to stand ready for a head-on assault in cooperation with Hungarian and Romanian forces.</p>
<h3>Italian Theater and Second Front</h3>
<p>Due to the Soviet advances in the southern sector of the German-Soviet front, the Soviet Union is taking advantage of the wavering Balkan states to engage in communist political activities.</p>
<p>However, after German troops entered Hungary, they eliminated dissent and maintained close contact with Romania, adjusting relations with Bulgaria and Turkey. Germany's position in the Balkans is becoming more secure.</p>
<p>In response to the Soviet advance south, the Italian front has completely stalled.</p>
<p>The areas of Nettuno, Anzio, and Cassino remain in German hands. Especially in the Cassino sector, Anglo-American forces have retreated due to the fierce German attacks. There are also various rumors regarding the location of the second front's landing. The most likely locations are the ABCD coastal area of northern France and the Dalmatian coast of the former Yugoslavia, invading across the Adriatic Sea from the Italian front.</p>
<p>However, the Italian front has the German 25th Division led by Field Marshal Kesselring to stop the enemy. The Balkans have 18 elite divisions under the command of General Löhr of the Luftwaffe, standing in readiness. Therefore, the enemy's hope of opening a second front from the Italian front, regardless of the timing, has little chance of success.

<h3>Sumatran Defense – A Glimpse</h3>
<p>The Flame Trees are blooming with bright red flowers, as I walk through the shady groves, the sea finally comes into view. After several days of travel from a certain location, I finally arrived at the coastline. At 2 PM, I arrived at a certain location to observe the defensive array of Sumatra. Unknown creeping vines grew as tall as a man. It is truly amazing that amidst the growth of these vines, the sand dunes or rocky terrain were carved out to complete solid fortifications. Countless solid fortifications capable of withstanding direct hits from bombs of several kilograms are found in this area alone. Not only along the coastline, but also in the hilly areas behind it, similar fortifications have been completed. Excellent fortifications are also being constructed on the promontory to the right. The reporter took the road back from this fortification, with fields on both sides. These are cultivated by the original inhabitants.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Lieutenant Iwaaki, adjutant of the garrison unit on this side, I observed the defensive situation in this area. The defensive array in this area is just as excellent as what I have seen and heard in the past few days. It is said that taking out such an excellent fortification, whether by air or by other means, is quite difficult. In addition, special attention must be paid to wild beasts and malaria. The king of beasts is the tiger. This area, throughout the island of Sumatra, has an especially large number of them. There are also many fish, wild boars, and pythons that feed on wild boars. One soldier, after studying and improving the tiger traps commonly used by the natives, created a new trap and captured a tiger alive. Another corporal killed a python in the dense forest and brought it back as a local product. It is not uncommon for soldiers from a certain unit to encounter a large python eating a wild boar and easily capture it while marching in the dense forest (弘謮 from the April 18th Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Preparations for Landing Operations</h3>
<p>The call that the Allied forces' landing operation in Europe is imminent has been growing louder recently. As for the time, location, and scale of the landing, the enemy seems to be in frequent consultation. The latest issue of the American magazine "Life" contains an article titled "Preparations for Landing Operations," which uses the North African campaign (from the winter of the previous year to the spring of the following year) as an example to discuss the complexity and difficulty of landing operations in terms of "troop organization." An abridged translation is provided below:</p>
<p>Landing operations, carried out at a specific time and location, absolutely do not waste war materials. In that North African campaign, the Allied command held meetings and selected three locations on the North African coast (later changed to twelve locations) for simultaneous landings. The landing date for the first American expeditionary force was scheduled for November, which was decided in the early summer of 1942. This is a period of about four months between decision and implementation. Such preparation is necessary to carry out a large-scale modern invasion.</p>
<p>Operational Plan</p>
<p>First, the military authorities must establish a comprehensive operational plan. Therefore, in the various offices of the U.S. Army, many officers held day and night meetings to repeatedly discuss the war. The next step is to determine the strength and branches of the troops to be used, and to calculate the appropriate composition of ground forces, air forces, and special forces. Taking ground forces as an example, the size of its forces must be coordinated with anti-aircraft units and mechanized units. The proportion of this coordination must be adapted to the various conditions of the landing site.</p>
<p>Combat Troops</p>
<p>Next is the question of what kind of special troops will be coordinated with the front-line combat troops. In the North African campaign, this included engineering units for bridging and medical units for the wounded. After this decision, the Army Department and the operational military authorities confirmed the deployment of troops.</p>
<p>But at all stages of the operational plan, troop equipment, personal equipment, and their supply are the most important issues.</p>
<p>Personal Equipment</p>
<p>The personal equipment of the soldiers participating in the North African operation, from knives and guns to woolen socks, exceeded fifteen kinds, and the types of clothing reached three hundred and ninety kinds. The various materials required by the communications unit, such as radios, telephones, and wires, totaled 10,000 kinds. The necessities of the medical unit reached 68,000 kinds. The bridging materials, excavators, and searchlights required by the technical unit amounted to about 100,000 kinds. Regarding weapons, tanks, artillery, ammunition, spare parts, and other various items and materials, there were approximately 250,000 kinds.</p>
<p>The amount of gasoline consumed by a unit is eighty times greater than that of a unit of the same strength in the previous World War. The weekly consumption of each division landing in North Africa was 4.2 million gallons of gasoline, 20 million pounds of food, and 37 million pounds of clothing and equipment. Personal equipment has also increased fivefold compared to the previous World War. The total personal equipment of soldiers in all branches amounted to 700,000 kinds.</p>
<p>During the North African landings, the goods loaded on transport ships occupied a volume of six tons for each soldier's equipment. In addition, one ton each was required for food, clothing, and ammunition.</p>
<p>It is a major issue to transport troops and supplies to the appropriate location at the appropriate time. For this reason, the officers of the transportation system must spend weeks carefully paying attention to ship production and transportation planning schemes.

<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Rotten Stone</p>
<p>I am lying in a dark corner of a corridor. I have a fever and can barely breathe. The heavy footsteps of people passing by in the corridor on the uneven floor strike my wounded heart. Unconsciously, I became tired, dizzy, temporarily lost consciousness, and closed my weary eyelids.</p>
<p>"Damn it, little brat, not even sick, just sleeping. How comfortable."</p>
<p>"Yeah, he came here, definitely not to study, but to enjoy himself."</p>
<p>"Hahaha..."</p>
<p>Those words suddenly startled me awake. I opened my eyes and looked at the people who were just saying bad things about me. Who else but two senior classmates. My heart eased a little, and I wearily closed my eyes again.</p>
<p>When I woke up, it was already dusk. My stomach was rumbling, as if urging me to quickly put some food in it. I had no choice but to reluctantly crawl up. As soon as I stood on the ground, I felt dizzy, unsteady, and lightheaded. To eat, I had to slowly lean against the wall and stagger into the living room.</p>
<p>The living room was already full of people eating. I still sat in my usual seat. I was aware of the disdainful gazes, but I ignored them and just ate my rice. But after eating half a bowl, I was full. I had to force down the remaining half bowl.</p>
<p>"Sick, sick, can eat rice, what kind of sickness is that?" The senior classmate muttered disapprovingly, but I didn't care what he said and just put the bowl of rice into my stomach.</p>
<p>After eating, I felt even worse. Suddenly, a chill came from inside my body, and I trembled. The rice I had just eaten came right back up. My head spun, and before I knew it, my eyes blurred, and I couldn't stand. I had no choice but to return to the corridor and lie down again.</p>
<p>When I woke up at midnight, I discovered that someone was talking next to me.</p>
<p>"Tell the teacher tomorrow, sick, sick, what kind of sickness is that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, good, let the little brat know our power, hahaha..." Those words were clearly directed at me by the two senior classmates.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, when I was burning with fever, my junior classmate ran over to me and said:</p>
<p>"Brother A Gui, the teacher is calling you."</p>
<p>When I heard the teacher call my name, my heart started pounding, as if I had committed some crime and was going to receive judgment from a judge. I wanted to escape, but I couldn't. I had no choice but to stand up and go to the accounting room to listen to the strict judgment. When I ran into the accounting room, the first thing he said to me was "Sick!"</p>
<p>"Yes, teacher," I replied faintly.</p>
<p>"How long has it been?"</p>
<p>"Almost a week," I answered directly, and then said, "Teacher, I will get better." Because I was afraid of being scolded by him, I added another sentence.</p>
<p>"Silly child, of course you will get better, but the air here is not good, and the place is small. It's inconvenient for you to be sick. If you have relatives here, it's better to go to your relatives' house for a few days, and come back when you are well." The teacher's words were very pleasant to hear, but in reality, they sentenced me to death. I didn't answer, pushed out of the accounting room, returned to where I slept, and lay down. I don't know what thoughts were disturbing me, preventing me from closing my eyes. My heart was burning like fire; my head was pounding like a hammer. Sadness, anger... came from the bottom of my heart, and finally I spoke a sentence:</p>
<p>"You, these demons... ghosts, are you... are you trying to force me to death?" As a result, a bout of dizziness and unconsciousness took me away, taking me into the thick fog of my mind.</p>
<h3>Words of a Substitute</h3>
<p>— Xu Ru Xun</p>
<p>My name is "Pen." Pitiful and regrettable, I am an orphan whose own parents are unknown, and of course, I have no surname or pedigree. However, I can describe the past of mankind in great detail, as if it were recorded. It is truly "doing too much for others, and too little for oneself."</p>
<p>After silently nurturing me, and after passing through many years in a muddled state, I found a benefactor who raised me among the trivial hairs. That was General Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty. During a hunt in the southern expedition to the Chu Kingdom, he accidentally discovered that the fine hairs of beasts could cultivate my temperament, enrich my nutrition, and complete my "pen life." Therefore, he selected the finest rabbit and deer hairs, brought them back to the capital to be bound and sealed, and meticulously innovated me, giving me a new life. The gratitude I feel for his painstaking efforts cannot be described by myself or even by Master Huan. Calamity unexpectedly descended: I was actually used to write for others in order to gain favor. The greedy Qin Shi Huang sullied my nobility. He treated me like a master enslaving me. Edicts and laws – all the murderous demons – were all issued and executed by my labor. Under the situation of daring to be angry but not daring to speak, I finally became an accomplice to cultural destruction. This is my greatest shame!</p>
<p>I was temporarily silent. The dark rule cannot last long. After that, I devoted myself to cultivating my character and nourishing my mind. In addition to the pure and clean tip of the pen, the suit of armor, I added a long bamboo stem that was straight and hollow, standing tall and graceful. I felt more and more refined and aloof. At this time, I began to come into contact with human history. I understood that as early as the end of the Zhou Dynasty, China's most sacred teacher, Confucius, had used a pen to write the "Spring and Autumn Annals." I would use this as my first contribution when I first entered the world.</p>
<p>The Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties were the peak period of Chinese calligraphy and also the period when aesthetic literature flourished. The intersection of these two high tides formed the golden period of my youth. Sucking the milk of ink and bathing in the moisture of the inkstone, I became stronger, fuller, more lively, and more unrestrained. Galloping on the snowy white paper, I had the feeling of the meeting of wind and cloud, and the spirit of soaring into the sky. I especially felt grateful for meeting the great calligrapher Wang Xizhi. He was considerate of me, treated me kindly, and cherished me. He possessed a unique talent, spent decades of hard work practicing, and with my great ability, he developed the immeasurable glory of the Sage of Calligraphy, firmly stepping onto the constellation of art.</p>
<p>Later, my heroic posture attracted a loyal companion: Mr. Han Changli, the great Confucian and master of ancient prose in the Tang Dynasty. He wrote a short biography for me - "Biography of Mao Ying", bestowing a surname and name, counting the classics and recording the ancestors. Although it was a playful essay, it did indeed increase my value once it passed the dragon gate.</p>
<p>The rapid passage of time has kept me in a state of leaping advancement. In response to the development of the times, the evolution of materials, and the demands of human society, my categories have become increasingly complex. By the time the doors were opened, European winds blew eastward, and the alarm bells of revolution echoed throughout the ancient land, awakening a group of people who were living in a drunken dream. Old models were no longer sufficient, and new transformations prompted me to create all kinds of fresh and beautiful subtle variations. I took a giant step again, and rationally jumped onto the international stage. Compared with other actors, I not only had no qualms, but also maintained the traditional quality, using both strength and flexibility to display extraordinary skills. Striding across the center of the century, observing the realm of culture, looking around, I couldn't help but feel complacent.</p>
<p>The world is innovating, and sometimes it is also destroying. Culture is becoming brighter, and sometimes it is also declining. History is developing, and sometimes it is also regressing. This should not be my fault, right? I have already dedicated my valuable life, for the noble ideals of heaven and earth, and exhausted my labor as much as possible, squeezing out the last drop of blood. For humanity, the "spirit of all things", how can I shirk my responsibility?</p>
<h3>Kite</h3>
<p>— Cao Yu Xun</p>
<p>— Who has abandoned leisure for a long time? Every spring, the tunes still sell.</p>
<p>The spring breeze has swept through the corners of the earth again, and the days have been clear. In the evening, on a barren field by a cliff, you can often see groups of three or five children jumping and scattering in the sunset. They look up at the sky, and there are a few simple paper kites in the sky. The kites take advantage of the wind, floating and swaying. The children clap their hands and laugh.</p>
<p>When I came back from my official duties, I often lingered by the roadside, watching them play this game; — and the memories were so melancholy.</p>
<p>Like the children in front of me, so innocent and carefree, they also played, and could also make kites — folding bamboo strips, bamboo frames, pasting paper. Especially Min, he had a clever skill, cleverly making butterfly-style and eagle-style designs, and adding suitable rubber bands to the top of the paper. In this way, when the kites flew into the sky, they would make a humming sound. So the children happily pulled the string, running and jumping on the street until the sun set into the valley, and everyone would reluctantly pack up and go home.</p>
<p>Because of this, Min and I became close friends. Min was not only a smart child, but also a good student in school. His family circumstances were very bad, and he could not concentrate on studying. In the early morning, he had to help his parents carry the plow and lead the cattle to the mountains before going to school. But the teachers therefore valued him even more.</p>
<p>I don't remember from what day Min suddenly stopped coming to school. After school, when we gathered on the grass, we didn't see his shadow.</p>
<p>"Min isn't coming anymore!" The children said regretfully. I felt even more lost holding the broken kite he made.</p>
<p>After a few more days, I was flying a kite in the fields again when I suddenly saw Min walking on the road with his father. I was excited and ran to him, shouting.</p>
<p>"Min, why aren't you going to school?"</p>
<p>"Min is no longer studying. Now he has to go to Xicun to look after cattle for others. He will come back to play with you in a few days." The answer was from Min's father, an honest middle-aged man, with a forced smile on his face. "Ah! Really?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Min didn't speak, just nodded. I wanted to tell him many things — for example, that a rib of the kite was broken and needed him to repair it; there were also… But looking at his depressed face, I stopped. Finally, I held his hand: "Min! When can you come again?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid…" He looked at me emotionally, "I regret it now, why did I love to play so much before and didn't study hard; now I have no chance to study."</p>
<p>A feeling of sympathy, sorrow, and self-reproach swept over my heart. What more could I say? In silence, we waved goodbye. I watched the backs of him and his father disappear in the sunset.</p>
<p>After that, I left my hometown to study in Shanghai and never received any news from him. Later, I was also affected by the war and illness and had to drop out of school. I drifted in this turbid business world, tasting the bitterness of life.</p>
<p>The memories of old friends and the sadness of dropping out of school often intertwined in my gray mood. When I saw these children playing kites, I thought of Min, I thought of Min's words:</p>
<p>"...Why did I love to play so much before and didn't study hard; now I have no chance to study!" (Reprinted from Yi Huo Xue)</p>
<h3>Desert Night</h3>

<p>Black sand,</p>
<p>Black desert,</p>
<p>Black desert night;</p>
<p>There is a wanderer carrying a heavy load groping in the boundless black desert.</p>
<p>…… ……</p>
<p>No moon and stars,</p>
<p>The desolate black night of the desert,</p>
<p>There is a wind like the howling of a desperate soul,</p>
<p>And a wind like a mythical beast of the sky.</p>
<p>"Terrible desert night," you say,</p>
<p>But, you cannot sigh nor can you stop. Behind the forever desolate desert,</p>
<p>Is the beautiful country of hope!</p>
<p>Do not say that your legs are extremely sore,</p>
<p>Do not say that even the juice of life is gone from your mouth!</p>
<p>Let tomorrow be your comfort,</p>
<p>Summon the footsteps of a warrior!</p>
<p>The oasis in your imagination,</p>
<p>Will appear at the first sunrise tomorrow.</p>
<p>Black sand,</p>
<p>Black desert,</p>
<p>Black desert night:</p>
<p>There is a wanderer carrying a heavy burden,</p>
<p>Groping on the boundless black sandbar.</p>

<h3>Commentary on the North-Central vs. Ren Yu Decisive Basketball Game</h3>
<p>The championship final of the Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament, Group A, between North-Central and Ren Yu, was held at the China Youth Gymnasium on the 10th (Wednesday) at 8:30 PM. All proceeds, in addition to the original face value of 40 yuan per ticket, will be used for the newspaper's scholarship fund (tickets at 200 yuan). To increase the donations, the newspaper's president, Mr. Chen, auctioned off the game ball midway through the match, which was purchased for a huge sum of 150,000 yuan, setting a new record for basketball auctions. The enthusiasm of the public is something for which we, on behalf of all impoverished students, express our respect. The event was unprecedentedly grand, and the game was exceptionally exciting. In the end, North-Central, relying on its rich experience, narrowly won by a score of 36 to 35, a one-point victory. Here, the reporter comments on the grandeur of the event and evaluates the tactics of the North-Central and Ren Yu teams.</p>
<h3>North-Central's Rich Experience Ultimately Secures the Championship</h3>
<p>North-Central team's style has always been known for its speed, but its tactics are primarily based on stability. However, they seem somewhat unfamiliar, leading to less-than-perfect execution. Li Zhenzhong received three fouls in just over ten minutes, limiting his ability to display his heroic prowess, which inevitably diminished the team's performance. However, Zhenzhong did not change his approach because of this, but proceeded with special caution, managing to play until the end, truly embodying the cultivation of a true warrior. Otherwise, the consequences of North-Central losing Zhenzhong due to fouls would have been unthinkable. North-Central's defense was mainly based on man-to-man marking, but the marking was not particularly brilliant, especially with Li Saizhong unable to stop Lin Weicong's attacks. However, relying on Shen Weigong as the key to scoring, they were still able to meet expectations. Weigong lived up to expectations, shooting with accuracy, and was truly a great contributor to securing the victory. Most notably, when North-Central was behind by nine points (32-23), the entire team was not flustered, but bravely moved forward, ultimately turning defeat into victory. This is truly the result of rich experience. If it were a team with less experience, they would have likely been defeated. In terms of individual technique, North-Central should have won, but considering the course of this battle, North-Central's victory was not without luck. Now that North-Central has won the Shanghai championship and has worked hard for the newspaper's charity game for scholarships, we can all congratulate them.</p>
<h3>Ren Yu's Excellent Performance But Missed Free Throws</h3>
<p>That evening, Ren Yu's players showed excellent skills, both audibly and visibly. During the attack, the two forwards penetrated deep into both corners, the center forward stood firmly under the opponent's basket, and the two guards circulated the ball outside, seeking opportunities to attack. In defense, they adopted a five-man joint defense, cooperating to block and never relaxing. This "steady and methodical" tactic greatly troubled Zhongbei. Yu Huanzi, as the commander, directed calmly, showing the demeanor of a veteran, which was truly remarkable. Zhuo Guorong and Ma Canxi, one firm and one gentle, were exceptionally composed. Their dribbling and interceptions were unique and could be called a pair of "iron guards." The young player Lin Weisong was smart and nimble, penetrating everywhere. His sudden attacks and shots were unpredictable. His achievements might not be inferior to those of Zhongbei's national players Feng Nianhua and Wang Hongbin, and his future is immeasurable. Li Zhaohe suffered a lot from his nearsightedness. His movements were sluggish and he repeatedly missed opportunities, making him one of the weakest members of the team. Perhaps he was intimidated by the strong opponent. During the attack, he always stood behind Zhen Zhong, which was a mistake. If he could have been more active, quickly moving forward to block Zhen Zhong when Huanzi got the ball, allowing Huanzi to take the opportunity to shoot, they would have scored more points and victory would have been within reach. The team's failure to make most of their free throws was also a major reason for their loss. When the score was tied at 34-34, Zhongbei's players committed a foul, and Huanzi had two free throws. If he had made both, they would have taken a two-point lead. Although Yu Gong tied the score, time was running out. In overtime, they could have fought to the end, and the outcome would have been uncertain. Unfortunately, he only made one, and time was up. The buzzer sounded, and they lost by one point, which was tragic. Looking at the course of the game, Ren Yu repeatedly had the upper hand. In the second half, the largest point difference was 32-23, leading by nine points. If they could have maintained the lead at that time, switching from offense to defense, adopting delaying tactics, not easily losing the ball after tiring the opponents, and luring the enemy to steal the ball in order to take advantage of the situation, victory would have been certain. But they failed to come up with this plan. Even Huanzi, with his seniority, failed to adapt to the situation. One wrong move led to lifelong regret. Was this fate or a mistake in strategy? We sincerely hope that Ren Yu's players will not be discouraged and will continue to work hard. The future is long, and there is great hope. We also express our sincere thanks to the team for playing for the charity match of this newspaper!</p>
<h3>Donghua: Two Masterpieces</h3>
<p>Since its formation, the Donghua team has been invincible and its reputation has spread far and wide. Recently, it has achieved two more masterpieces. As a reporter, I am pleased and offer some comments as a memento.</p>
<h3>Representing the Chinese Team: Overcoming Portugal</h3>
<p>Last Sunday (April 30), our Chinese team competed with Portugal in the international cup football final at the racecourse. As a result of the hard battle, our Chinese team relied on the combined efforts of the three armies, displaying its divine power, and finally defeated the stubborn enemy with a score of 2-1, forcing them to sign a treaty of surrender. They avenged three consecutive defeats and finally achieved their wish, which was truly gratifying. No wonder more than 10,000 fans were so excited and cheered thunderously, resounding through the clouds. Some people even set off firecrackers to celebrate. Their joy and dancing were beyond description. On that day, the Chinese team's lineup was entirely composed of Donghua players. The coordination was more sophisticated, and the attack and defense were orderly. In addition, the Donghua team's momentum and spirit were like the rising sun, invincible. This time, facing a strong enemy, they had no choice but to fight back. They were determined to fight to the death and not return until they had defeated the enemy. Therefore, although Portugal was stubborn, how could they not be defeated?</p>
<p>In this match, both teams had clear movements and were able to pay attention to sportsmanship, fully displaying their excellent football skills, which is especially worth writing about. The game was thrilling, and we were always in a state of shock. At that time, the reporter felt dizzy and blurred, and even his breathing became rapid, reaching the extreme of tension. When our team won the game with a score of 2-1, the pressure on my chest was relieved, and my breathing gradually returned to normal.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two teams' styles, both excelled in subtlety, lacking the boldness of great generals and focusing on skillful passing. Therefore, the battle was like glue, inseparable. The success of our Chinese team had its reasons.</p>
<p>The defense adopted by our Chinese team on that day was based on man-to-man marking, with the defenders guarding the enemy's wings and the midfielders marking the enemy's two inside forwards, closely following the enemy's center forward. The Portuguese team planned to use a tactic of flanking attacks and a central breakthrough. The Portuguese team's right wing was stronger than its left wing, but its right wing happened to meet our captain Li Ning, so they were helpless. The enemy relied on Da Chong Fafanxiao for central breakthroughs, but Fafanxiao was closely guarded by our generals Xin Fuzhen and Zhang Lin'gen in rotation. Because of this, the Portuguese team's offensive failed. To evaluate the team's offensive strategy, it also used the rapid advance of both wings, with Han Longhai and Shu Jin as the main players, which often created threatening scenes. Longhai was able to pay attention to offside, as I suggested, so he was very successful. The enemy team suffered a lot, and we should all recall this. The ability of Youliang and Li Yao on both wings to pass the ball early was most commendable, because the enemy's defense was purely based on experience, and this was the only way to control them. Finally, there are two points worth mentioning: one is the beauty of the Hua team's third defender system. The third defender was first created in Shanghai by "Dan Weisi," and the first to test it was Feng Yunyou. In my memory, the purpose of both using and advocating it was to have the center back defend the rear, but this time, the Hua team's third defender system was used with great flexibility. When Xin Fuzhen retreated, Zhang Lin'gen followed suit to take the center position to assist the forwards. Conversely, when Zhang sometimes retreated to act as the third defender, the old Xin returned to his original position. The two handled the situation skillfully, and the enemy generals were temporarily unable to figure it out. What must be mentioned is that the goalkeeper Zhang Banglun had unexpected feats that day. Xiao Zhang had such achievements and was enough to be proud of.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Cup Quarterfinals: Defeating the Police Again</h3>
<p>Last Sunday (July 7), Donghua played against the police in the Mayor's Cup quarter-finals. Donghua had lost twice to the police in the league, but had narrowly won 3-2 in both games with some risks. In this game, Donghua showed its power and won 3-1, leaving the police defeated for the third time.</p>
<p>It is said that Donghua's offense is better than its defense, but I think the team's offense and defense are absolutely equally developed in the current state. Looking at the defense of Li Ning, Zhuang Ji and Ren Zhi in covering the goal area, it is beyond the reach of other teams in Shanghai. Zhang Banglun's writing is getting better and better, saving dangerous balls repeatedly, and his contribution is not small. He is able to save the ten shots of Xiao Huangmao, that is, Donghua's forwards are very good at attacking people's weaknesses with their own strengths. The reason why they have been able to win repeatedly in the past is based on this. In this game, Dong mostly used the central breakthrough, and the shot also took a low ball, because the opponent's guards paid attention to Donghua's wings. The enemy's goalkeeper is only good at high balls, but cannot save low balls. Because of this, Donghua won a great victory.</p>
<p>Now that the Chinese team has won the international cup final and the Donghua team has also reached the final of the Mayor's Cup, they will both compete with Italy for the constellation. The Mayor's Cup will be decided this weekend (July 14). I sincerely hope that the Donghua soldiers will continue to work hard, take advantage of the victory and go straight to the end! (Mei Bixian)</p>
<h3>Tidbits from the Stadium</h3>
<p>After the match between Zhongbei and Renyu ended, Zhongbei's coach, the big fat Dai Changdi, and the little fat Xu Zhaotai, embraced and kissed, which shows the innocence of the people in the sports world.</p>
<p>When Zhongbei was nine points behind, the team leader Wang 君義 did not hesitate to ask to join the battle. Sure enough, Zhongbei took the lead, and Wang was satisfied.</p>
<p>Some people feel sorry for Ren Yu, who easily gave up the championship. If Zhongbei had failed, someone would have stood up for them. Therefore, the most innocent people in the world are fans.</p>
<p>The order in the stadium that evening was very good, which shows the hard work of the staff. The police's performance in guarding the gate was especially good (Lü Cheng)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Women's Cup Volleyball Tournament: Preparing to Open</h3>
