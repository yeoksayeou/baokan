<h3>日空軍續獲戰果轟沉敵戰艦巡艦雷伊泰島上敵基地化火海</h3>
<p>菲律賓某基地三十日中央社電　日軍航空隊之一隊，二十七日薄暮空襲雷伊泰灣內之敵艦隊，已經判明戰果，計轟沉敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，運輪船一艘。　　菲律賓三十日中央社電　日軍航空隊二十八日會再度空襲雷伊泰島敵機塲，對前遭日空軍轟炸起火中之塔克羅班機塲，復予以痛擊，確之戰鬥機約四十餘架，頃間使之起火，又四發大型機一架及小型運輪機一架亦起火。同時並於空戰中擊滅敵戰鬥機九架，p38型機一架，是役日軍僅自焚一架，未歸還者五架。　　菲律賓前綫三十日中央社電　雷伊泰島之日陸上部隊，在塔克羅班南方及塔拉克附近、與優勢之美軍激戰奮鬥，日機隊則連日晝夜出動，對雷伊泰灣內之艦船及塔克羅班，塔拉克兩地美軍橋頭堡及機塲加以猛襲，獲得大戰果，然敵乃急於修復塔克羅班及塔拉克機塲，並有p38型及兩拉曼式艦上機着陸，以飛機掩護推進其基地航空全力，同時反復向雷伊泰灣增強全力。二十八日下午，雷伊泰灣內之運輸船達四十艘，戰盤或巡洋艦九艘，自敵軍上陸以來，日軍已予其重大損害，乃屬確實。日航空部隊二十七日下午起至二十八日晚數次強襲，所收戰果如次：在雷伊泰灣炸毀驅逐艦一艘，炸沉運輸船四艘，燒燬一艘，燒燬大型登陸用艇數艘。在塔克羅班機塲擊落敵機十四架，燒燬三架，炸燬一架，炸毀燃料彈藥倉庫四處並數跑道，在塔拉克機塲炸毀陸上設施兩處，並炸燬高射砲陣地。　　馬尼刺三十日中央社電　雷伊泰島日軍陸地部隊精稅，由空軍之活躍協力，意氣甚爲昂揚，奮戰頗收戰果。塔克羅班西方之日軍，死守高地，不退一步，敵軍雖作猛攻，卒受重創而敗退。塔拉克方面敵軍，以戰車隊爲先導，刻正進至塔拉克西方夫羅亨附近，由塔拉克漸次繞圍北上，企圖使塔拉克與塔克羅班中間塔蒙高地之日軍陣地孤立，並擬完成塔拉克塔克羅班間之連絡，然日軍對此勇猛邀擊，刻仍激戰中。日軍連夜挺身斬殺，敵軍損失頗大，二十五日鈴木部隊長於夫羅亨方面，親率部下於月光中壯烈衝殺敵陣，敵軍即時陷於大混亂。</p>
<h3>日首相激勵國民努力補給軍需品在大阪國民會席上演說</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　據大阪電話稱，日本政府翼政會翼贊會主辦之一一億憤激擊滅英美國民大會]，在小磯首相，緒方國務相，小林翼政會總裁，岡田衆議院議長等出席下，於三十日下午一時，在此間中之島中央公會堂舉行，決議大會宣言，并對陸海軍感謝敬吊後，即由小磯首相講演，表明政府完成勝利之決意，旋由小林總裁，岡田衆議院議長等講演，至下午三時閉會。　　東京三十日中央社電　日小磯首相，於大阪國民大會席上之演講要旨如次：深謀遠慮之日陸海軍，於攸關國運之大決戰序幕之台灣海面空戰，終告大捷，然敵或新整陣容，集結大軍再度來犯，故刻正各就準備行動。日軍自十月二十日以來，除邀擊於塔克羅班海岸登陸之敵軍，更擊毀雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船九十四艘，登陸用舟艇二十一艘及飛機多架，繼之爲殲滅登陸敵軍，已有萬全之準備，今仍擴大戰果中。又自十月二十四日迄今，對從海空兩方面攻菲律賓東方海面之敵機動部隊，加以猛擊，擊沉擊毀其航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦及運輪船等二十七艘以上，更擊落敵機五百餘架，攻勢決戰之序幕中。日軍巳告大捷，戰局刻以菲律賓及其周邊爲主戰塲，開始本格之決戰。又日軍此次之光輝戰捷，已使歐洲之盟邦德國今後之戰況得能有利，並使大東亞各國家，各民族間之團結，愈臻鞏固。吾人於茲所痛感者，即對精強無比之將兵充分供以所需飛機及其他武器，以澈底滅敵軍，以寡兵敵衆，乃日軍之特長，即此次戰果亦然，雖如此，但若無必需量最少限度之兵器，子彈之補給，則無論如何精強，亦絕難致勝。現在雖無與敵方恃有同量物量之必要，然最少限度須確保將兵發揮其眞價得能如意作戰程度之兵器子彈，凡我國民必須設法補給，且此事絕非難事，以日本之現狀，一億國民，一致拼命努力，則對滅敵之飛機及其他軍需品之供給，絕無不安。吾人當前應努力之目標，唯有獲取決戰之勝利，此即護持日本國體永存之道，尤以此次大東亞戰爭之苛烈勝敗，實關係國家民族之存亡，且其中更無絲毫容許妥協之餘地，將來之決戰，如吾人不獲勝利，則國家民族即淪於滅亡，企圖中途與敵人妥協者，不異疾人說夢，吾人唯有爭取最後勝利一途而已。日本國家一經滅亡，日本民族將依何而存在，吾人不得不決戰到底，擊滅敵人之不遜，唯有爭取最後勝利，乃護持日本永存之道。駁斥敵人非望之議論，現已無用，正義及人道之論，唯有待最後勝利獲得後，始能與敵人聲述，完遂戰爭，獲取最後勝利，則日本之道義能宣揚世界，東亞之復興，亦可實現。現日軍於決戰之序戰中，打開其勝利突擊路，吾人唯有循此突擊路而前進，求最後勝利早日實現，依目前所獲之效果，敵之戰意，已稍受挫，趁此機會，吾人即應增強前方戰力，此爲絲毫不容猶豫者。唯有實行必勝之施策，故政府已有堅持非獲得最後勝利不止之決意，亦望國民諸君始終爲政府後盾，至獲得最後勝利之日而後已。</p>
<h3>中日兩國外長舉行交換廣播</h3>
<p>闡述兩國締盟意義　　南京二十九日中央社電　三十日爲中日兩國簽訂同盟條約週年紀念日，我國褚外交部長及日本重光外相，爲表示慶賀，特於是日晚九時三十分至十時，舉行交換廣播，闡述兩國締結盟約之意義。茲分誌褚外長及重光外相交換廣播略詞如次：　　褚外部長略謂國府還都之初，本以和平統一，作爲建國的中心。但是自從日本發動大東亞戰爭以後，我國情勢即爲之一變。　　東亞是東亞人的東亞，中國和日本旣是東亞的兩大國家兩大民族，自然遵照國父的遺教，應當爲友，不應當爲敵。站在同一戰綫上，向擊滅英美之途努力邁進。　　自從大東亞戰爭發動以後，不到數月，就將英美侵略中國，侵略東亞的勢力，次第肅清。由於這種情勢的轉變，中日兩國就在去年今日，締結了中日同盟條約，並且規定同盟條約實施之日起，從前中日基本關係條約，連同春一切附屬文書，一併失效。簽訂了同盟條約以後，日本方面，即將上次訂約時所得到的特權加以拋棄，同時對於中國方面所憂慮的各點，亦澈底予以滅除。所以這種疑慮，當時便渙然冰釋了。　　從這個同盟條約簽訂以後，中日兩國就由友邦進步成爲盟邦，站在完全平等互惠的立塲上，結成永久同盟的關係，而共同致力於大東亞的建設。這在東亞的歷史上，眞是空前創舉的劃期的一新紀元。國父所希望日本援助中國，廢除不平等條約，已實現了，　　光陰荏苒，忽忽又屆一週年紀念了。我們惟有根據中日同盟條約，將大東亞戰爭以來，同甘共苦，同生共死的精神，結成鋼鐵一般，把國民總力集結起來，抱定必勝的信念，直至大東亞戰爭完遂，大東亞共榮建設告成。使中國的獨立自主，得到鞏固的保障，這是今日紀念中日同盟條約締結一週年的感想。　　日重光相　　東京三十日中央社電　日重光大東亞相，三十日作廣播講演，紀念中日同盟締約周年，其大意如次：所謂　齒輔車，善鄰友好，早爲空頭支票，外交辭令歟，茍中日關係係以　齒輔車，善鄰友好爲其本來面目者，何以過去兩國間有如許誤解軋鑠與門爭乎。余承認過去中日關係有許多難以令人滿意之處，但絕不以爲其原因當歸中國一方負責，然則過去不幸之中日交惡，未必定係中日之責任，無寗謂爲多基於第三國之策動者，實昭然若揭矣。吾人當謂因英美以亞洲爲殖民地，而榨取侵略，故東亞乃化作列強之角逐塲，英美謀阻止東亞民族覺醒之政策，始眞使中日兩國間又覆演出許多不幸之歷史者也。中日人士迷於英美人爲其世界殖民政策而建築之國際機構中迄未得出，然一旦猛省三年前大東亞戰爭時，歷遍東亞，敲起警鐘，於是覺悟兄弟之關於牆時，因仍能外禦其侮，夫膺懲外敵保衛東亞，乃東亞各國之共同責任，尤其日本東亞先進，更感覺責無旁貨。大東亞戰爭乃東亞各國家各民族自覺之戰爭，亦爲使世界對於東亞發生自覺之戰爭，使東亞認清東亞，復歸東亞，然後東亞始能解放復興，於是中國乃由同甘共苦之方針，進而爲同生共死之政策，終於參加大東亞戰爭。中日兩國回復其本來面目。而去年中日同盟條約之精神，亦在大東亞宣言中已有所闡明，良以日本帝國所期者，在排除英美等對世界之獨佔稱覇野心，芟除一切偏見，對於任何民族，不特不加以排除，且進而與之協力，以實現世界親和，使各民族各得其所，此種精神，要亦爲日本帝國對外政策之基調，而日本之戰爭目的，亦在於此。吾人對於此正義戰爭目的，除抱有確固不移之信念外，並確信正義之戰必獲終局之勝利，而往前邁進，在今日菲律賓之決戰中，澈底擊潰敵人之戰況，即足以證明之。現在東亞諸民族已根據與日本同樣之政策，愈益團結，與努力完遂戰爭，此實爲人類史上之劃期表現。至於敵英美兩國，其對戰後之和平，亦更多所論議，最近由於美政府之招請英美蘇各代表，會集中舉行會議，於該會議中會由英美兩國代表担任反軸心聯盟案，吾人就此以視，即知彼等所期者，無非欲求由英美蘇三國支配世界，永久征服今日之國，而遂其稱覇世界之野心。不消說，小國之利害，實非彼等所顧，英美此種行爲，實澈底反映英美強力支配國際之企圖，彼等因爲深知　方之無能，故今日對渝方不惟加以惹罵，其在中國之對於不管重慶或是延安，彼等　有可利用之處，則不惜予以利用，以期在政治上，軍事上，乃至經濟上，確立並強化其對中國大陸之覊權。彼等爲實現其稱覊世界之野心，更以破壞爲目的，進行征服，反之，吾人則係以建設爲目的，以互相協力爲職志，進而救東亞，此爲東亞人所深識者。時至今日，中國正遭逢重大之時局，中國民族自應奮起，倡導民族大運動，在親和大協力之大　下，救中國之將來，爲東亞之復興而努力，去年一月中華民國政府會毅然決然對英美兩國宣戰，自是以來，即與日本帝國站於同生共死關係之上，而中日同盟條約亦於一年前成立，條約中會闡明中日兩國之永遠善鄰關係，因之吾人，更相信中日兩國必能互相携手，與其他東亞各國各民族共同復興東亞，進而貢獻於世界和平，當此中日同盟條約締結一週年紀念之日，本人於此，謹以滿腔熱誠，來表明祝賀之意。</p>

<h3>中日締約週年汪主席訓詞</h3>
<p>光明在望努力前進　　南京卅日中央社電去年今日有一件劃時代的歷史大事，值得我們隆重紀念的，那就是中日同盟條約的締結。</p>
<h3>勝利之光愈加明顯</h3>
<p>這件大事，使中國近百年歷史簇新開展，也使整個東亞全局的面目煥然一變。因此而引起全世界的聳然注視，是無足驚異的。　　大東亞戰爭到了今天，可以說已經到了決勝的最緊急階段。太平洋上大決戰的序幕，也正在熱烈的揭開了。這一年來菲律賓毅然的向英美宣戰，印度國民軍也一直協同日軍，英勇突擊踏上復興民族，重建祖國的大道。最近盟邦大軍，對於假藉中國領土，爲其作戰基地之英美侵略勢力，發動大規模的進攻，平漢粵漢兩綫先後掃蕩，長沙衡陽兩地相繼陷落，桂林也危在旦夕。想起這些戰區，總是我們的土地，因戰事波及而致於流離失所的民衆，總是我們的同胞，實不勝其感慨。再想起我們的土地，爲什麼要爲英美而焦土？我們的同胞爲什麼要爲英美而犧牲？同盟條約締結之後，中日兩國已有了一條正義和平的大道，爲什麼直到今日，還要爲英美所愚弄，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，藉中國爲戰塲而焦土中國，感慨之餘，更不勝其沈痛。從另一方面看來，則英美兇殘毒辣之陰謀，因此而愈益　處，其窮途掙扎之情勢，亦由此而愈趨窮迫，這幾天來，太平洋上捷報頻傳，台灣菲律賓海面敵美艦隊潰不成軍，這樣英美侵略東亞的基地，一天一天的減少，侵略東亞的武力，一天一天的削弱，在敵方遭受如此空前的打擊，和威脅之下，我們的勝利之光，在東亞解放聲中，愈加明顯的透露出來。今天正逢着中日盟約締結週年紀念，我們回顧旣往，當然是愈加興奮，愈加自信。（未完）代論</p>
<h3>實現同盟條約的工作方向  陳彬龢　　昨日爲中日同盟一週年紀念，上海市商會，工商聯誼會，市福利協會，新聞聯合會等四團體，舉辦紀念演講會，彬龢應邀講演，茲將講詞移載於左：　　今天是中日同盟一週年紀念日，我們在這裹舉行紀念演講會，有兩種意義：第一，檢討一年以來怎樣實踐同盟條約中的精神。第二，今後怎樣實現同盟條約中的目標。　　什麼是同盟條約中的精神呢？就是以互惠爲基調，互相協力，於此，我們檢討一下，一年以來，我們怎樣實踐的？實踐到怎樣程度？講到協力，當然是彼此之間相互的。在中國對日本的協力，又可分爲兩個方面，一是政府，一是民間。所以，同盟條約中也說[於各方面講求互助敦睦之方法]，所謂各方面者，縱的是政府與民間，橫的是政治與經濟。　　什麼是同盟條約中的目標呢？就是建設大東亞，確保大東亞的安定。簡單的說，中日兩國的政府領導民間，從政治與經濟方面相互協力，共同向建設大東亞的目標邁進，這是同盟條約整個的精神。大東亞建設完成之時，就是同盟條約實現之日。　　不過，目前是在大東亞戰爭之時，是廓清英美侵略大東亞殘餘勢力之時，欲求建設大東亞并確保安定，必先爭取大東亞戰爭勝利。最近台灣菲律賓東方海面之戰，盟軍已將敵美艦隊擊潰，奠定大東亞戰爭勝利的始基，但是我們爲確保最後勝利，我們必須依據同盟條約的精神，從事[勝利第一]的工作，這就是實踐條約的精神。　　我們瞭解了這一點，就有了工作的方向，政府方面必須努力於政治的革新，確立治安，抑平物價，使民生安定。在人民方面，必須努力於生產的增加，協助政府，督促政府，實行革新政治。惟有在和平區內，在戰時狀態中，努力革新工作，俾期政治修明，經濟圓滑，民生安定，那末，一方面可以根據同盟條約的換文旨趣，按情形所許，隨時由兩國協議，加以調整。一方面使重慶統治下的人民，瞭解和平區內政治上軌道，民生的安定情形，自然而然心響往之，全面和平也必然會實現了。我始終認爲全面和平，與其空談和幻想，而無濟於事，不如切切實實做出幾件榜樣的工作，必能爭取民心，一致歸向。所以，除了我們政府與人民共同努力之外，同時，希望盟邦方面也能重視這一點，更進一步實踐對華新政策，尤其對於國民政府的革新政治，確立治安，抑平物價的種種工作，施以更積極的協力。對於中國人民的生產工作，更切實的援助。　　其次，在四年以前，中日兩國簽訂基本關係條約時，汪主席會說過：[條約中的規定，都具有彈性，看我們努力如何，我們努力，可以使之向好的方面，不然，就只有更傾向於壞的方面。]去年簽訂的同盟條約附屬議定書中，規定恢復全面和平，戰爭狀態終了時，日本撤去駐在中國的兵隊及放棄駐兵權。所以，一般人或有的疑慮，都可不必消極的去憂想，應該積極的從上面所述的工作方向去努力。恢復全面和平，實現同盟條約，一切的一切，都需要我們自己加倍的努力。</h3>

果，實爲我大東亞民族必獲大東亞最後勝利之預兆也。我等均當共同慶祝，同時對於在此大戰中犧牲之英勇將士，我等極表感謝敬虔之心也。爲澈底擊滅英美起見，當在後方盡最大之奮鬥及努力也。指導要點　　中國方面基於中日同盟之精神爲求大東亞戰爭之勝利，八月二十六日中國國民政府最高國防會議通過民衆政治指導綱要，實施強調宣傳，其指導要點如下：一使民衆奉行國父之遺教，二強化民衆對政府擁護及對領袖服從之信念，三使民衆對於國策順應協力，四使認識中日同盟及大東亞共同宣言，五使強固大東亞戰爭必勝信念，六使諒解認識盟邦日本，七使勵行新國民運動，八發揮對於社會國家之民衆自發之精神及實踐之責任觀念，九使民衆實踐戰事生活，十使肅正民衆思相，十一使增強生產，十二使協力治安工作之強化。深信此項要點如能一一實現，則中國前途，必趨光明。讀者助學消息　　本報與男女青年會合辦　　學術演講今日下午開始　　本報與青年會女青年會聯合主辦之[學術系統演講]，將於今日（星期二）下午五時至六時半假八仙橋青年會大禮黨舉行，請華東大學教育學院院長林漢達博士主講，題爲[怎樣修學？]共分四講，今日第一講爲[怎樣閱讀？]各高中以上學生均可參加聽講，本報受助學生之聽講劵，可向各大學團契代表領取，高中無團契組織者，逕向本辦事處索取。預料參與聽講者，必十分擁擠。</p>

<h3>Working Directions for Implementing the Alliance Treaty Chen Binhe Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, the Municipal Welfare Association, and the Journalists' Association jointly held a commemorative lecture meeting. Binhe was invited to speak, and his speech is transcribed below: Today is the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance. We are holding a commemorative lecture meeting here, which has two meanings: First, to review how we have implemented the spirit of the alliance treaty in the past year. Second, how to achieve the goals of the alliance treaty in the future. What is the spirit of the alliance treaty? It is based on mutual benefit and mutual cooperation. Here, let us review how we have implemented it in the past year and to what extent. When it comes to cooperation, it is of course mutual. China's cooperation with Japan can be divided into two aspects: the government and the people. Therefore, the alliance treaty also states [to seek methods of mutual assistance and amity in all aspects]. The so-called "all aspects" refers to the government and the people vertically, and politics and economy horizontally. What are the goals of the alliance treaty? It is to build Greater East Asia and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. Simply put, the governments of China and Japan lead the people to cooperate with each other in politics and economy, and jointly move towards the goal of building Greater East Asia. This is the entire spirit of the alliance treaty. The day when Greater East Asia is built is the day when the alliance treaty is realized. However, at present, it is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and it is the time to clear the remaining forces of Anglo-American aggression in Greater East Asia. To build Greater East Asia and ensure its stability, we must first strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Recently, in the battle on the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Philippines, the Allied forces have defeated the enemy's American fleet, laying the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War. However, in order to ensure the final victory, we must engage in the work of [Victory First] in accordance with the spirit of the alliance treaty. This is to practice the spirit of the treaty. Once we understand this point, we will have a direction for our work. The government must strive for political reform, establish public order, curb prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. The people must strive to increase production, assist the government, and urge the government to implement political reform. Only by working hard to reform in the peaceful areas and in the state of war, so as to make politics clear, the economy smooth, and the people's livelihood stable, can we, on the one hand, adjust the treaty at any time through consultations between the two countries, according to the exchange of notes and the circumstances. On the other hand, we can make the people under the rule of Chongqing understand the political stability and the stability of people's livelihood in the peaceful areas, and they will naturally yearn for it, and comprehensive peace will inevitably be realized. I have always believed that comprehensive peace, instead of empty talk and fantasy, is useless. It is better to do a few exemplary things in a down-to-earth manner, which will surely win people's hearts and unite them. Therefore, in addition to the joint efforts of our government and people, we also hope that the allied countries will also pay attention to this point, and further implement the new policy towards China, especially for the National Government's reform of politics, establishment of public order, and suppression of prices, and provide more active cooperation. Provide more practical assistance to the productive work of the Chinese people. Secondly, four years ago, when China and Japan signed the Basic Relations Treaty, Chairman Wang said: [The provisions of the treaty are flexible, depending on how we work hard. If we work hard, we can make it go in a good direction. Otherwise, it will only tend towards a bad direction.] The affiliated protocol to the alliance treaty signed last year stipulates that when comprehensive peace is restored and the state of war ends, Japan will withdraw its troops stationed in China and abandon its right to station troops. Therefore, some people's worries can be eliminated, and they should actively work in the direction described above. To restore comprehensive peace and realize the alliance treaty, everything requires our own doubled efforts.</h3>

<p>The City Enthusiastically Celebrated the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Yesterday. Various Agencies and Organizations Held Commemorative Ceremonies. Yesterday (30th) was the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. At this critical autumn of the Greater East Asia War, the allied Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great victories on the front lines, severely damaging the stubborn enemy. The significance of this anniversary is extremely significant. Various agencies, organizations, and schools in the city raised the national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth early in the morning. At 10:00 AM, the municipal government held a reception for foreign guests in the auditorium. The municipal party headquarters, the New Citizens' Movement branch, and other organizations jointly held a commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the municipal party headquarters. At 5:00 PM, the Journalists' Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, and the Municipal Welfare Association jointly held a celebration and commemorative lecture meeting at the Daguangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road. The event was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. At 8:30 PM, Liu Yangshan, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a special celebratory broadcast on Shanghai Radio. Municipal Government Authorities Hosted Foreign Guests The municipal government held a celebration meeting in the municipal government auditorium at 10:00 AM. Those present included Minister Zuo Mei, representing Counselor Sakata, Vice Admiral Kondo, Colonel Matsushima, Director Okumura, Secretary Nakada, Consul General Yano of the Japanese Consulate General, Tatsichiro Funatsu, Representative Matsuura of the Japanese Residents' Association, Chen Riping, Xiong Jiandong, Chen Binhe, and more than 40 bureau and department chiefs. Mayor Chen went to Beijing on official business, and Secretary-General Wu represented him in hosting the reception with the bureau and department chiefs, as well as counselors and secretaries. Secretary-General Wu also gave a speech, briefly explaining the significance of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the relationship between the signing and the Greater East Asia War. He also expressed that as the Greater East Asia War intensifies, the Allied Japan has achieved great results in the naval battle off Taiwan and the Philippines. China and Japan should unite and strive together and cooperate with each other to complete the war objectives as soon as possible. Subsequently, Yano, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the signing of the alliance treaty between China and Japan is to cooperate in building Greater East Asia. To build Greater East Asia, we must completely eliminate the Anglo-American forces of aggression in East Asia. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, had already expounded this meaning in the Pan-Asianism he advocated, which is worthy of our admiration. In order to realize the liberation of East Asia and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, we sincerely hope that the Chinese side will provide greater cooperation. His words were earnest. Finally, they toasted each other to celebrate, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. Lecture Meeting by Four Groups The Shanghai Journalists' Association and other four groups jointly held a commemorative lecture meeting at the Daguangming Theater at 5:00 PM yesterday. The guests included Captain Shioda, representing Minister Matsushima of the Press Department of the Allied Forces' Fleet in China, Director Matsudaira of the Information Department of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, and the presidium: Tatsichiro Funatsu, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Huang Jingqi. First, Huang Jingqi, the rotating executive director of the Journalists' Association, reported on the significance of the commemoration, and invited Tatsichiro Funatsu and Chen Binhe to give speeches on behalf of the people of the two countries (the speeches are published separately). The meeting lasted for more than an hour before ending. Then, [Long Live the Teacher] was shown, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM. Director Matsudaira Discusses Enemy America's Concealment of Defeats The broadcasts of the US and Australia are contrary to each other. The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 2:30 PM yesterday (30th), receiving Chinese journalists from the city. Director Matsudaira of the embassy and Vice Consul Fukuma were present. Director Matsudaira expressed his thoughts on the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on the spot, and at the same time, he made a speech on the enemy America's extreme concealment of its defeats, stating: The enemy's statements on the war situation in the Pacific are even more ridiculous. For example, the declared losses of fleets and air forces have no accurate figures at all, and are vaguely worded. Secondly, the statements on the war situation in the war zones are even more chaotic, talking east and west, with no system at all. Furthermore, the broadcasts of the enemy's US and Australian sides are contrary to each other. The Australian statements are more profound, and their views on the current situation are deeply serious, and they warn the people to step up their efforts. However, the United States is only perfunctory. In this situation, the US government does not hesitate to conceal the facts of its defeats and deceive the people of the truth. This is actually because the election of the president is approaching, and before the preliminary election on November 7, it is absolutely unwilling to reveal the true war situation. This is actually a habitual technique used by Roosevelt to control his re-election as president. Traffic Safety Campaign, Today is the Sixth Day. The "Safe Traffic Week" organized by the city's police bureau is today the sixth day. The administrative office of the bureau dispatched personnel to various districts yesterday afternoon to inspect.

Minister Matsushima Talks About Enemy America's Bluffing Grew's Speech Reveals Desire for Peace Mr. Grew, former US Ambassador to Japan, delivered a speech at the US Navy Memorial Day dinner in Washington on the night of the 27th, saying that the United States is eager for peace due to the successive defeats in Taiwan and the Philippines. This fact deserves attention. Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Fleet Press Department of the Chinese side, made a statement yesterday, saying: [In the Leyte Gulf, our air force, with the determination to die, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's remaining ships and transport ships, and inflicted heavy blows on the enemy's land forces and aviation facilities. The enemy suffered an unprecedented disastrous defeat at sea, and the enemy was momentarily shaken, and was contemplating self-abandonment, while waiting for the arrival of reinforcements. And we finally believe that the decisive battle between Japan and the United States, with Leyte Gulf as the center, will continue for a considerable period of time, and the enemy's weakness of excessively long supply lines will give us many opportunities to attack. The enemy has concealed its losses. Since the 28th, the losses of the US Navy announced by the US Navy Headquarters and the US Navy Department have been extremely small, while the propaganda of our losses is very large. And Roosevelt, when meeting with journalists, even boasted that the US Navy is the largest force in the modern world, and Mr. Grew, the former US ambassador to Japan, declared that the United States should compromise with Japan in order to seek peace. And Mr. Grew has now abandoned his lifelong cautious attitude, and his words actually reflect the domestic situation in the United States. This example shows that the United States, on the one hand, is bluffing, and on the other hand, is concealing its losses. The United States is very anxious and uneasy about the current crisis in the United States. And we are now quickly dispatching aircraft and warships to the front line for a decisive battle, and annihilating the enemy's follow-up forces.] Manchurian and North China Police Administration Delegation Returns to Shanghai The [Police Administration Delegation] sent by the Shanghai Police Bureau to Manchuria and North China to inspect police administration departed on October 3 and returned to Shanghai on October 28.

Yesterday's News Report Time 7:05 Eliminate All Obstacles and Fully Destroy England and America Speech by Tatsichiro Funatsu Allied friends, Today, October 30th, marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan last year. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, the Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association, and the Journalists' Association are holding a first-anniversary celebration meeting. I am very honored and happy to participate in this grand event. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have attacked the key points occupied by England and America in East Asia like a hot knife through butter, and have completely driven the forces of England and America out of East Asia. However, the enemy England and America have not given up their ambitions and are still thinking of making a comeback, so they are carrying out a counterattack with all their strength. Until recently, the war has become increasingly fierce. Especially when the enemy America is holding presidential elections, the enemy American government can only adopt a blitzkrieg strategy in order to adapt to its domestic political relations, dreaming of defeating Japan in a short period of time. On the other hand, the Chinese National Government also joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9 last year. Burma and India also successively declared independence from England, and are now at war with England. The Republic of the Philippines declared war on the United States on the 23rd of last month, and now China, India, Burma, the Philippines, and Japan are all on the same front. Please think about it, if we, the East Asian countries on the same front, are defeated in the Greater East Asia War, then the future destiny of East Asia will be heartbreaking, and East Asia will return to the state of oppression of East Asian nations in the past 100 years, and will permanently become a colony of England and America, and East Asian nations will once again be their slaves. In order to seek the permanent liberation of Greater East Asia, we, the ten billion East Asian nations, must endure hardship and strive for independence and autonomy. We must unite as one, spare no sacrifice, eliminate all difficulties and obstacles, and break through and overcome them. And we must exert all our strength to completely defeat the forces of England and America, so that East Asia will forever be East Asia for East Asians. Recently, the sea and air battles between our army and the enemy America off the east coast of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea, and Leyte Gulf were unprecedented fierce battles in world war history, and Japan won a great victory. The great victory that we have achieved is a harbinger of the final victory of Greater East Asia for our Greater East Asian nations. We should all celebrate together. At the same time, we express our gratitude and reverence to the brave soldiers who sacrificed in this great war. In order to completely destroy England and America, we must make the greatest struggle and effort in the rear. Guiding Points Based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, the Supreme National Defense Council of the Chinese National Government approved the Outline for Guiding Public Political Thought on August 26 and implemented it with emphasis on propaganda. The guiding points are as follows: 1. To make the people follow the teachings of the Founding Father; 2. To strengthen the people's belief in supporting the government and obeying the leader; 3. To make the people cooperate with the national policy; 4. To make them understand the Sino-Japanese Alliance and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration; 5. To strengthen the people's belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War; 6. To make them understand and recognize the allied Japan; 7. To encourage them to practice the New Citizens' Movement; 8. To give full play to the people's spontaneous spirit and practical sense of responsibility towards society and the country; 9. To make the people practice wartime life; 10. To purify the people's thinking; 11. To increase production; 12. To cooperate in strengthening security work. It is firmly believed that if these key points can be realized one by one, the future of China will inevitably be bright.

<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues to Achieve War Results, Bombing and Sinking Enemy Battleships and Cruisers, Turning Enemy Base on Leyte Island into a Sea of Fire</h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - A unit of the Japanese air force attacked the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf on the evening of the 27th. The confirmed war results include the sinking of one enemy battleship, one cruiser, and one transport ship.</p>
<p>Philippines, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force again bombed the enemy airfield on Leyte Island on the 28th, inflicting heavy damage on Tacloban Airfield, which had already been set ablaze by the Japanese air force. Approximately forty enemy fighter planes were set ablaze in short order, along with one large aircraft and one small transport plane. Additionally, nine enemy fighter planes and one P-38 type aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. The Japanese army only lost one plane due to self-immolation, and five planes did not return.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese ground forces on Leyte Island are fiercely fighting against superior American forces near Tacloban and Tolosa. Japanese aircraft have been dispatched day and night to relentlessly attack ships in Leyte Gulf and the American bridgeheads and airfields in Tacloban and Tolosa, achieving significant war results. However, the enemy is urgently repairing the Tacloban and Tolosa airfields, and P-38 type and two Grumman type carrier-based aircraft are landing to provide air cover for the advancement of their base's air power. Simultaneously, they are repeatedly reinforcing their forces in Leyte Gulf. On the afternoon of the 28th, there were forty transport ships and nine battleships or cruisers in Leyte Gulf. It is confirmed that the Japanese army has inflicted significant damage on them since the enemy forces landed. The Japanese air force launched several strong attacks from the afternoon of the 27th to the evening of the 28th, and the war results are as follows: In Leyte Gulf, one destroyer was destroyed, four transport ships were sunk, one was burned, and several large landing craft were burned. At Tacloban Airfield, fourteen enemy aircraft were shot down, three were burned, one was destroyed, and four fuel and ammunition depots and several runways were destroyed. At Tolosa Airfield, two ground facilities were destroyed, and anti-aircraft gun emplacements were destroyed.</p>
<p>Manila, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's land forces on Leyte Island are well-trained and highly spirited due to the active cooperation of the air force, and their fierce battles have yielded considerable war results. Japanese forces west of Tacloban are holding the high ground and refusing to retreat. Despite the enemy's fierce attacks, they suffered heavy losses and retreated. Enemy forces on the Tolosa side, led by tank units, are currently advancing to the vicinity of Dulag west of Tolosa, gradually encircling northward from Tolosa, attempting to isolate the Japanese positions on the high ground of Tamo in the middle of Tacloban and Tolosa, and intending to complete the connection between Tolosa and Tacloban. However, the Japanese army is bravely engaging them, and fierce battles are still ongoing. The Japanese army has launched night raids, inflicting considerable losses on the enemy. On the 25th, Unit Commander Suzuki personally led his troops in a heroic charge against the enemy positions under the moonlight in the Dulag area, causing the enemy to fall into great chaos.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Encourages the Nation to Strive to Replenish Military Supplies, Speech at the National Convention in Osaka</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Osaka, the "100 Million People's Rage to Destroy England and America National Convention," sponsored by the Japanese government's Imperial Rule Assistance Association, was held at the Osaka Central Public Hall in Nakanoshima at 1:00 PM on the 30th, with the attendance of Prime Minister Koiso, State Minister Ogata, Imperial Rule Assistance Association President Kobayashi, and Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada. The convention adopted a declaration, expressed gratitude and condolences to the army and navy, and then Prime Minister Koiso gave a speech, expressing the government's determination to achieve victory. Subsequently, President Kobayashi, Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada, and others gave speeches, and the convention adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the Osaka National Convention are as follows: The Japanese army and navy, with deep foresight, concluded the air battle over the sea of Taiwan, which was the prelude to the great decisive battle concerning the nation's destiny, with a great victory. However, the enemy may reorganize their forces and gather a large army to attack again, so preparations are currently underway. Since October 20th, the Japanese army has not only engaged the enemy forces landing on the coast of Tacloban, but also destroyed 94 enemy ships, 21 landing craft, and many aircraft in Leyte Gulf. They have made thorough preparations to annihilate the landed enemy forces and are currently expanding their war results. Furthermore, from October 24th to the present, they have launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile units attacking the eastern sea of the Philippines from both sea and air, sinking and destroying over 27 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships, and shooting down over 500 enemy aircraft, in the prelude to the decisive offensive battle. The Japanese army has already reported a great victory, and the war situation is currently centered on the Philippines and its surrounding areas, and a full-scale decisive battle has begun. Moreover, the glorious victory of the Japanese army this time has enabled the war situation in Europe for its ally Germany to be more favorable in the future, and has further strengthened the unity among the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia. What we deeply regret is that in order to thoroughly destroy the enemy army, we must fully supply the unparalleled strong soldiers with the necessary aircraft and other weapons. It is the specialty of the Japanese army to defeat the enemy with fewer soldiers, which is also the case in this war result. However, even if we have the minimum amount of weapons and ammunition, no matter how strong we are, it is absolutely difficult to win. Although there is no need to have the same amount of materials as the enemy, we must ensure that the minimum level of weapons and ammunition is available so that the soldiers can exert their true value and be able to fight as they wish. All of our people must find ways to replenish them, and this is by no means difficult. With the current state of Japan, if 100 million people work hard together, there will be no worries about supplying the aircraft and other military supplies needed to destroy the enemy. The only goal we should strive for at present is to win the decisive battle, which is the way to protect the eternal existence of the Japanese national polity. Especially the severe victory or defeat of this Greater East Asia War is related to the survival of the country and the nation, and there is no room for compromise. If we do not win the decisive battle in the future, the country and the nation will be destroyed. Attempting to compromise with the enemy halfway is like a sick man's dream. We only have the path of striving for the final victory. Once the Japanese nation is destroyed, how will the Japanese people exist? We must fight to the end, destroy the enemy's arrogance, and only strive for the final victory, which is the way to protect Japan's eternal existence. It is useless to refute the enemy's unrealistic arguments now. The arguments of justice and humanity can only be stated to the enemy after the final victory is obtained. Completing the war and obtaining the final victory will allow Japan's morality to be promoted to the world, and the revival of East Asia can also be realized. Now the Japanese army has opened its victory assault route in the preliminary battle of the decisive battle. We only have to follow this assault route and move forward, so that the final victory can be realized as soon as possible. According to the current results, the enemy's will to fight has been slightly frustrated. Taking this opportunity, we should strengthen the frontline combat power, which is not allowed to hesitate. Only by implementing the policy of certain victory, the government has the determination to persist until the final victory is obtained. I also hope that the people will always be the government's support, until the day when the final victory is obtained.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers of China and Japan Hold Exchange Broadcast</h3>
<p>Elaborating on the Significance of the Treaty of Alliance Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The 30th is the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan. To express congratulations, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of China and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru of Japan held an exchange broadcast from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM on this day, elaborating on the significance of the treaty of alliance between the two countries. The following is a brief record of the exchange broadcast by Foreign Minister Chu and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu:</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu stated that at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it regarded peaceful reunification as the center of national construction. However, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the situation in China has changed.</p>
<p>East Asia is the East Asia of East Asians. Since China and Japan are the two major countries and two major nations of East Asia, they should naturally follow the teachings of the Founding Father, be friends, and not be enemies. Standing on the same front, they should strive to eliminate England and America.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, in less than a few months, the forces of England and America that invaded China and East Asia have been gradually eliminated. Due to this change in the situation, China and Japan signed the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan on this day last year, and stipulated that from the date of implementation of the Treaty of Alliance, the previous Treaty of Basic Relations between China and Japan, along with all attached documents, would be invalid. After the signing of the Treaty of Alliance, the Japanese side abandoned the privileges it had obtained during the previous treaty, and at the same time thoroughly eliminated the points that China was worried about. Therefore, this doubt was dispelled at that time.</p>
<p>Since the signing of this Treaty of Alliance, China and Japan have progressed from friendly countries to allied countries, formed a permanent alliance relationship on a completely equal and mutually beneficial basis, and jointly devoted themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. This is truly an unprecedented epoch-making new era in the history of East Asia. The Founding Father's hope that Japan would assist China and abolish unequal treaties has been realized.</p>
<p>Time flies, and the first anniversary has come again. We can only base ourselves on the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, unite the spirit of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together since the Greater East Asia War like steel, gather the total strength of the people, hold the belief that we will win, until the Greater East Asia War is completed and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is achieved. This will consolidate the guarantee of China's independence and autonomy. This is the feeling of commemorating the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan today.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru gave a broadcast speech on the 30th to commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan. The gist of his speech is as follows: Is the so-called "lips and teeth supporting each other, good neighborly friendship" merely a hollow check and diplomatic rhetoric? If the relationship between China and Japan is based on "lips and teeth supporting each other, good neighborly friendship," why have there been so many misunderstandings, frictions, and conflicts between the two countries in the past? I admit that there have been many unsatisfactory aspects in the past relationship between China and Japan, but I do not believe that the reason for this should be attributed to the Chinese side. However, the unfortunate estrangement between China and Japan in the past was not necessarily the responsibility of China and Japan. It is more obvious that it was based on the instigation of a third country. We should say that because England and America used Asia as a colony, exploited and invaded it, East Asia has become a competition arena for the great powers. The policy of England and America to prevent the awakening of the East Asian nations is what has truly caused so many unfortunate histories to be repeated between China and Japan. The people of China and Japan are still lost in the international institutions built by England and America for their world colonial policy, but they have not been able to emerge. However, once they suddenly realized during the Greater East Asia War three years ago, they traveled all over East Asia and rang the alarm. Then they realized that when brothers are fighting within the walls, they can still resist foreign insults. It is the common responsibility of all countries in East Asia to punish foreign enemies and defend East Asia. Especially Japan, as the advanced country in East Asia, feels even more obligated. The Greater East Asia War is a war of self-awareness for the countries and nations of East Asia, and it is also a war to make the world aware of East Asia, to make East Asia recognize East Asia, to return to East Asia, and then East Asia can be liberated and revived. Therefore, China has progressed from a policy of sharing weal and woe to a policy of living and dying together, and finally participated in the Greater East Asia War. China and Japan have restored their original appearance. The spirit of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan last year has also been elaborated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. The reason is that what the Japanese Empire expects is to eliminate the ambition of England and America to monopolize and dominate the world, eliminate all prejudices, and not only not exclude any nation, but also cooperate with it to realize world harmony, so that all nations can get what they deserve. This spirit is also the basic tone of the Japanese Empire's foreign policy, and the purpose of Japan's war lies in this. In addition to having a firm and unwavering belief in this just war purpose, we also firmly believe that the war of justice will win the final victory, and move forward. The war situation in which we have thoroughly defeated the enemy in the decisive battle in the Philippines today is enough to prove this. Now the nations of East Asia are becoming more and more united based on the same policy as Japan, and are working hard to complete the war. This is truly an epoch-making expression in human history. As for the enemy England and America, they have also discussed more about peace after the war. Recently, at the invitation of the US government, representatives from England, America, and the Soviet Union gathered to hold a meeting. At that meeting, representatives from England and America were responsible for the anti-Axis alliance case. From this, we can see that what they expect is nothing more than to control the world with the three countries of England, America, and the Soviet Union, permanently conquer today's countries, and fulfill their ambition to dominate the world. Needless to say, the interests of small countries are not what they care about. This kind of behavior of England and America thoroughly reflects their attempt to dominate the international community with strong power. Because they know that the other party is incapable, they are not only scolding the Chongqing side today, but also regardless of whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an in China, they will not hesitate to use any places that can be used, in order to establish and strengthen their control over mainland China in politics, military affairs, and even economics. In order to realize their ambition to dominate the world, they are carrying out conquest for the purpose of destruction. On the contrary, we are aiming at construction, taking mutual cooperation as our duty, and then saving East Asia. This is what the people of East Asia deeply know. Today, when China is facing a major situation, the Chinese nation should rise up, advocate a national movement, save China's future under the great cause of harmony and cooperation, and strive for the revival of East Asia. Last January, the government of the Republic of China resolutely declared war on England and America. Since then, it has stood in a relationship of living and dying together with the Japanese Empire, and the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan was also established a year ago. The treaty clarified the eternal good-neighborly relationship between China and Japan. Therefore, we firmly believe that China and Japan will be able to work together to jointly revive East Asia with other East Asian countries and nations, and contribute to world peace. On this day of the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, I would like to express my congratulations with full enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>37 American Planes Attacking the Philippine Islands Shot Down</h3>
<p>Philippine Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 270 enemy American carrier-based fighters invaded Manila and Clark Field three times from 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 29th. Thirty-seven were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft units in the airspace above the airfield, and the rest fled in panic.</p>
<p>Manila, 30th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force is urgently seeking to seize control of the air over Leyte Gulf and disrupt the Japanese air supply line. On the 29th, approximately 30 carrier-based aircraft were dispatched to attack the Manila area, 60 to attack Clark, and approximately 10 to attack Tuguegarao in northern Luzon. They were fiercely attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft fire and fighter squadrons, and they fled in haste without dropping their bombs. Two were shot down over Manila, and the details of the war results are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Chengdu</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, Japanese planes bombed Chengdu on the 29th, and Chongqing also issued an air raid alert, which lasted for four hours.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Morotai, Heavily Damaging Enemy Base Point</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Continue on Peleliu Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the South Pacific base, the Japanese air force repeatedly attacked the enemy airfield on Morotai from the 16th to the 26th, inflicting great losses. As Morotai Island is an important base point for the enemy to strengthen its air force in the Philippines, the losses suffered by the enemy have a great impact on the operation.</p>
<p>Peleliu Island Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - The battle on Peleliu Island continues fiercely overnight, centered on the northern central part of the island. On the night of the 28th, Japanese ground forces and naval surprise attack units responded to each other and launched a night attack on the enemy's positions on the northern coast, which then developed into a bayonet fight, inflicting great damage on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Address on the Anniversary of the Treaty Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Light is in Sight, Strive Forward</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Today, one year ago, there was an epoch-making historical event that is worth commemorating, that is, the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>The Light of Victory is Becoming More and More Obvious</h3>
<p>This major event made China's nearly century-old history brand new, and also changed the face of the entire East Asian situation. Therefore, it is not surprising that it has attracted worldwide attention.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has reached today, and it can be said that it has reached the most urgent stage of the decisive battle. The prelude to the great decisive battle in the Pacific is also being enthusiastically unveiled. Over the past year, the Philippines has resolutely declared war on England and America, and the Indian National Army has also been cooperating with the Japanese army, bravely attacking and embarking on the road of national revival and reconstruction of the motherland. Recently, the allied forces have launched large-scale offensives against the British and American aggressive forces that are falsely using Chinese territory as their combat base. The Pinghan and Yuehan lines have been successively cleared, and Changsha and Hengyang have fallen one after another. Guilin is also in imminent danger. When I think of these war zones, which are always our land, and the people who have been displaced due to the war, and the civilians who are always our compatriots, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. When I think of why our land has to be scorched for England and America? Why do our compatriots have to sacrifice for England and America? After the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance, China and Japan have embarked on a just and peaceful path. Why do we have to be fooled by England and America to this day, to have East Asians kill each other, and to use China as a battlefield to scorch China? In addition to being moved, I cannot help but feel deeply pained. From another perspective, the brutal and vicious conspiracy of England and America is therefore becoming more and more exposed, and their situation of struggling at the end of the road is also becoming more and more desperate. In the past few days, good news has been frequently reported in the Pacific. The enemy American fleet in the sea of Taiwan and the Philippines has been defeated. In this way, the bases for England and America to invade East Asia are decreasing day by day, and the armed forces to invade East Asia are weakening day by day. Under such unprecedented blows and threats, the light of our victory is becoming more and more clearly revealed in the liberation of East Asia. Today is the anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Alliance. When we look back on the past, we are of course becoming more and more excited and more and more confident.
