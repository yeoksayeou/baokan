<h3>國民的恊力</h3>
<p>戰事已到決戰階段，平素積聚的國力，因爲長時期浩大的消費，都需要極大的補充，能夠補充國力，使國力新生的，便是全國的國民，國民協辦的程度決定國力的增加量，而政府領導國民方針的良善與否，又是國民能否協力的決定點。　　松平情報部長從日本回來之後，發表談話，稱日本[國民勤勞]精神的澈底實行，使全國總民族力量，凝固一體，完成大時代偉大的奇貴，他並舉出日本某地，在荒蕪的葦草業生的塲地上，國民們披荊斬棘，不辭勞瘁，夜以繼日的工作，卒造成船塢，並建竣木船不下八十餘艘。這是人定勝天的精神，這是國民協力的表示。　　爲什麼日本國民能夠這樣協力國事？第一是國民自身的覺悟，第二是政府的領導有力。德富蘇峯翁對於政府的四大主張，要信賴國民，要敬重國民，要聽取國民之聲，要實施國民本位的政治，在提倡領導國民協力的時候，要顯出他的重要性。上有爲民的政府，然後下有爲國的國民，政府是人民的，是愛護人民的，那末人民當然是服從政府的，愛護政府的，這是民本主義的天經地義，而[民爲邦本，本固邦寗]又是中國歷代以來的名訓。　　看了盟邦上下努力的情形，任何人都應當有深刻的覺悟。決戰時期政府必須竭力使用民力，政府並且可以懲罰不出力的國民，問題乃在政府怎樣的做法。孟子說：[佚道使民，雖勞不怨，生道殺民，雖死不怨殺者]，這是多麼理想的景象。諸葛亮治罰，開誠心，佈公道，科教嚴明，賞罰必信，無惡不懲，無善不顯，吏不容奸，人懷自勵，因此內安庶衆，外禦強侮，這是治民使民的最好方法，七擒孟獲，六出祁山是整個罰國民族的戰爭，是在全國國民協力之下而執行的。　　治國以爲民爲最要，這是中外古今一律的定理。這個定理使國民在平時安心爲國建設，在戰時樂意爲國犧牲。現代戰爭的嚴重性不能和古代相比，因此現代國家需要國民的力量更比古代國家爲多。要使國民勞而不怨，死而不怨，政府更需十二分的努力爲民，除此之外，更沒有第二條路，這是國民本位政治的精義，他的成效，看看盟邦已可瞭然。　　中國參戰已快要二年了，我們國民們很慚愧不能出多少力，我們政府更應當反省，爲什麼不能領導國民出力？在決戰時期，中國國民個個都應當有力出力。但是，在國民們有力量無從發揮，政府當局要領導而無從領導的塲合，大家必須從歷史上，從世界各國的現勢上，從盟邦日本的一切爲國爲民的措施上，覔取一個借鏡，找尋一條出路。國民的協力已是迫不及待，國民怎樣協力，政府怎樣領導國民協力，更是迫不及待的課題。</p>
<h3>日海軍在太平洋將發揮最大威力蘇軍事專家論美攻菲困難</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　蘇聯軍事專家相爾瑪西夫，頃於海軍機關雜誌亦色艦隊中發表一文，題爲菲律賓作戰，茲錄其要旨如次：美軍在培里琉島登陸之目的，在制壓帛琉羣島，以作進攻菲律賓之基地，然美軍之菲律賓作戰，前途困難尚多，爰美軍重要基地之美國西岸，距離夏威夷及澳洲兩地甚遠，故美軍企圖在帛琉君島建設大補給基地，且日軍不僅在菲律賓及荷屬東印度等地擁有大量軍隊，並貯藏量甚豐富，因此，菲律賓之作戰較過去之任何作戰亦感困難。美國戰時情報局於九月底會列舉反軸心軍對日作戰有利之點，並詳述日軍之優點，謂日本持有達成各種軍需品增進能力，日軍食糧兵器製造品及原料等，亦有大量之貯藏，日海軍依然可發揮其最大威力。　　里斯本十八日中央社電　據紐約電，美國週報主辦之時事議論大會，十六日已開始，此次太平洋艦隊司令尼米資會自珍珠灣向該會廣播講演如次：對日作戰勝利之途徑尚遠，且艱險尚多，吾人必須覺悟，太太平洋之抗戰，需時尚久，此乃根據事實之結論，基於地理學，地形學及可能動用船隻之事實，陸軍及海軍戰略之事實等，戰爭之進展，今後尚待莫大努力，乃向全國民所要求者。</p>
<h3>德海軍總司令電賀日海相日海軍大勝德人興奮</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：德海軍總司令杜尼資海軍上將，致電日本海軍大臣慶祝，全文稱：[余代表德軍，特向閣下道賀帝國海軍在台灣對敵軍艦隊之大勝。此此勝利，在吾人共同對英·美非法要求之戰事中，無疑予美國艦隊以重大之打擊，德國海軍聞訊之下，不勝歡欣，此次勝利，對於吾人不啻一服興奮劑]。</p>
<h3>德報揭載日軍戰果</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國各報十七日連續揭載台灣東方海面日海軍之大戰果，柏林晚報刋稱，羅斯福應再認識日本之決意與力量，尼米資在屢次向國內報告美海軍在台灣未敗北時，已蒙日軍之痛烈打擊，此種事實，恐已使其難於出口。尼米資會高唱對日戰勝尚屬困難，早日結束戰爭，乃錯誤之思想，太平洋上美軍之攻勢，正與羅斯福等所期待者相反也。</p>
<h3>滿張總理發表談話</h3>
<p>新京十八日中央社電　日軍在台灣東方海面獲得大戰果後，張國務總理發表談話，披瀝滿洲完遂戰爭之決意，謂隱忍待機之日本陸海軍，以迅速之勢，反擊敵軍，獲偉大戰果，已由日大本營發表，日陸海軍將士之善謀勇戰，所獲之戰果，固爲東亞各民族感激不置者。然決戰始於今日，由此次之勝戰開始，反攻乃絕好機會，使敵無進攻之間隙，故必須舉國家全力，集中於戰力增強，以期前綫之補給澈底。今適逢豐稔之秋，將開始[收買]，又煤鐵及飛機之生產，亦正由生產載士之努力，已有飛躍之增強，實不勝感謝也。</p>
<h3>日舉國上下再接再厲</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日內閣情報局橫情報官，十八日會見駐日中國記者團時，特就此次台灣海戰發表談話，其大意如次：羅斯福爲使四選有利，乃罔顧戰略，襲擊台灣，企圖于軍事上露一力量，用以促成國民之關心，結果企圖未逞，反遭慘敗。因此其第五十八機動部隊之主力，幾被日軍擊滅悶，致遭受重大影響。反之，隱忍自重之日海軍，殆盡，民間輿論，已呈苦則把握良機，大舉反攻，收獲戰史上空前續有之赫赫大戰果，日本傳統之海軍精神，已于此次海戰完全表露無遺，由於此次戰果之結果，國內民氣頓呈明朗，日小磯首相登台後，民氣明朗闊達之目標，軍事上完全達民，然日本國民均知，此次戰果絕非最後勝利，故舉國上下，以上次勝利爲轉機，再接再厲，爲獲第二，第三之勝利而努力。</p>
<h3>敵美機動部隊襲台灣目的</h3>
<p>日海軍專家予以揭穿　　東京十八日中央社電　日本著名之海軍軍事專家伊藤正德氏，頃就此次美第五十八機動部隊空襲台灣之戰略意圖，發表談話如次：敵美此次大規模空襲台灣，其得不償失之事實，已爲世人所公認，敵軍空襲台灣之目的，第一在偵察日軍</p>
<h3>本土防衛</h3>
<p>錢之虛實，其次在企圖破壞台灣島之航空基地設施，換言之，敵軍之目的，在偵察日軍虛實及破壞日軍航空力，敵海軍戰略之最要者，在企圖南滅日軍聯合隊，與日軍之希望擊滅美海軍如出一轍，然其目下戰法，爲誘導日軍至數百公里至一千公里之海面會戰，其時間爲在菲律賓或小笠原羣島實施大規模登陸作戰之前後，無疑其作戰上之一大障碍，因台灣爲基地航空兵力之蓄積處，日軍如於此處確保偉大戰力，敵之南方作戰，則不得不加以警惕，台灣之威力，絕非間諜所能察知者，惟有</p>
<h3>絕大實力</h3>
<p>始能揭穿其內幕，此即有作戰價值之點，故十月十二日之來襲，可謂當然之舉。第一日終了之後，十三日復行繼續攻擊，如即早撤退，仍爲聰明，但終因貪過多，遂遭日軍大打擊，敵重要機動部隊之主力，已蒙致命打擊，敵軍知日·美兩軍於南方展開海戰時，日軍必將有效利用基地空軍，故敵之第二目的，不得不發動此次攻勢，然結果日軍之損耗，完全與敵所預料者相去甚遠。大東亞戰爭勃發之初，威爾斯親王號之被日軍擊沉，當然亦爲基地航空兵力所爲，故美軍當然策謀事先防止</p>
<h3>日軍炸沉</h3>
<p>其艦艇航空母中心之空襲部隊與基地。空軍之戰鬥，縱然兵力無顯著差異，然陸地方面則絕對有利海上，有利之點，旣便於急襲，同時亦能發揮機動力之特性，即空襲之後，易於脫離，如欲作兩三次攻擊，則將暴露海上部隊之弱點，況日軍精銳正秘密待命中。台灣爲最大之航空基地，日本旣於此編成基地，同時更整備援助體制，換言之，敵人如進攻台灣，則日軍於相當時期內，勢將採取包圍形勢，故敵無論企圖空襲任何基地，亦必遭重大打擊。此次之戰勝，相信爲</p>
<h3>此次大戰</h3>
<p>中之大勝，吾人必須準備相當兵力，以待敵軍補充後之再侵略，此次大勝後必須昂揚將兵之鬥魂，同時更得結集相當兵力，於適時適地，一舉大戰，於此則需要優秀機之增產與陸·海軍統率之協力，亦即日本於戰術上獲勝，同時亦須於戰略上獲勝，日本必須常時把握以上各條件，簡言之，日本必須準備今後隨時粉碎敵之反覆空襲，按時予以重創，本諸此種信念，邁進戰爭。</p>
<h3>培里琉島日軍夜襲敵陣地</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，培里琉島日軍，自十二日以來，連日因台灣海面日軍大捷，士氣愈趨旺盛，仍確保中央高地，每夜不斷衝入敵軍陣地，斬殺敵軍多人，由於日軍之不斷猛攻，敵第一綫兵士疲憊已極，不得已與援軍換防，日軍乘機進攻，十六日下午，水府山方面，有小規模之戰鬥，其他方面殆無變化。</p>
<h3>楠本公使談話</h3>
<p>北平十八日中央社電　日新任駐北平公使楠本實隆中將，日前於新京談話如次：中國事變前，余會任職於上海，其後任部隊長時，更會轉戰於華中各地，今次被任職華北，尚屬初次，建設途上之華北，無論治安上，經濟上，當前頗有各種重要問題存在，然其要者，在使戰爭獲勝。一切施策，均須集中於此點，絕不可拘泥於枝節，余決願中日提携，爲完遂共同目的，鼎力以赴云云。又該公使預定二十日左右離滿歸國後再赴任。</p>
<h3>駐渝美空軍遭重大打擊</h3>
<p>襲廣州美飛機受挫　　東京十八日中央社電　敵太平洋艦隊之綜合主力，自十二日以來，由於日軍連日發動海空作戰，已遭潰滅。蓋駐渝美空軍此次來襲台灣之行動，係爲呼應來攻之敵太平洋艦隊主力而爲者，於此作戰上實堪注目。蓋十二日來襲台灣各地之敵機約一千一百架，其中有一小部份爲駐渝美空軍B24型機。十四日來襲台灣之敵機約一百架，則係B29型機。惟十二日來襲之敵B24型機編隊，僅以其中少數敵機作無系統之濫炸而已。但十四日來襲之B29型機雖達百架，然移時即行遁去，并未投彈·由此以觀，駐渝美空軍之企圖，已歸於失敗之最大原因，無非由於日中國派遣軍連續發動偉大作戰，使駐渝美空軍遠退內地所致。至於敵B29型機爲敵人所誇爲超寬要塞者，然在第二次來襲九洲時，經日新銳戰鬥機打擊後，即已暴露此其脆弱性。即在十四日來襲台灣之敵B29型機一百架，亦終於潰走，并未有任何收獲。其理由料係因敵畏懼日新銳戰鬥機所致。總之，在此次海空戰中，駐渝美空軍之協力敵機動部隊，在作戰上雖可謂爲共同作戰，然並無何意義，僅係一效果極微全無系統之單獨行動而來，時至今日敵機動部隊已經潰滅，其足以呼應協力駐渝美空軍之能力，亦於此喪失矣。　　日軍前綫某基地十八日中央社電　渝美空軍十七日下午三時十五分許，以轟炸B24型及型B25型等約十六架，戰鬥機P51型及P40型約廿餘架之混合編隊，計約四十架，空襲廣州地區。經日防空砲火及戰鬥機羣之邀擊，擊落其P51三架，擊毀其P55一架，餘均沿西江向肇慶方面倉惶遁走，是役日方無損失。　　廣州十八日中央社電　日軍基地訊：駐渝美空軍P40型機三架，於十七日下午零時卅分左右，來襲丹竹，爲日軍部隊邀擊，當擊落其一架。</p>
<h3>斯蒂維爾唔白崇禧</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據合衆社柳州訊：東南亞美軍副司令斯蒂維爾，已於十五日急赴柳州，會見渝東司令白崇禧·張發奎·美第四航空隊司令威斯特爾，對變更航空隊之配置，作重要協議</p>
<h3>廣州日軍最近戰果</h3>
<p>中國大陸日軍某基地十八日中央社電　日軍在中國南部截擊來襲之敵援，邇來戰果更爲擴大。計十五日下午，於廣州上空空戰，擊毀敵戰鬥機轟炸機九架，日機未歸還者四架，但其中二架之駕駛員已行生還。據云除收上述職果外，更會擊落P51型機一架。又十六日於敵機來襲高湍時，擊落B24型機二架，（內有一架未證實）擊毀其他敵機數架。</p>
<h3>敵美福州蠢動失敗</h3>
<p>大陸基地十八日中央社電　敵美於福州方面蠢動之傳說，過去會一度流行，當地於日軍佔領福州後，據判明，原係美軍擬於該方面設置潛水艦基地，開始派遣測量技師約五十名，至福州方面實施調查工作，關於測量及調查書類，已多被日軍發見沒收。此外並發現以福州爲基地，英美人用以收集情報之無綫電機及書信，由此已更足證明該事件之正確。</p>
<h3>美第三艦隊構成人物</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　華盛頓電，美海軍部十七日發表，於臺灣海面被擊潰之哈爾賽第三艦隊首腦部之構成人物如次，司令長官大將哈爾賽，副司令長官李中將，第五十八機動部隊司令長官中將來茲卡，航空母艦司令長官中將馬克金，戰鬥隊司令官少將夏曼。</p>
<h3>航空母艦現勢</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　美航空母艦之現勢，在開戰當時，美海軍計有薩拉特加級三萬三千噸者二艘，恩德波萊斯級一萬九千九百噸者三艘，皇家級一萬四千五百噸，瓦斯浦級一萬四千二百噸者七艘，迄今正式空母約在十五艘內外，其十一艘爲根據一九四零年擴充兩洋艦隊計劃而行動工之愛塞克斯號二萬六千噸，時速三十五海里，繼有象格利拉號二萬七千五百噸與培布頓號二萬七千噸進水。此外，正在建造中者，有根據一九四二年造艦計劃之正式空母二十艘及四三年計劃之四萬五千噸級超大型空母，可起落四發重轟炸機者三艘，迨全部完成，則正式空母可達四十餘艘之多。巡洋艦改裝空母。爲謀補充損失計，有特將一萬噸級之巡洋艦十艘改裝成空母，每艘載飛機五十架，時速三十三海里，特製空母，乃以高速度船舶改裝者，爲護送航行大西洋之船團，特大量建造，最近則隨同機動部隊出動於作戰海面，可載飛機三十架，以運輸飛機警戒潛艇爲主要任務，現在美國此種母艦，共約五六十艘。</p>

<p>南京十八日中央社電　此次日軍在台灣與菲島東方海面，所獲之偉大戰果發表後，我國各地上下，無不異常興奮，對於戰局前途，益堅必勝信念。蓋徵諸此次敵美敢冒險於台灣海域，展開機動作戰，其欲於中國大陸沿岸登陸，事先獲一立足點之企圖，實至顯明，今經日軍予以痛擊，不僅擊破其企圖，須從而確保中國沿岸之安全。是故捷報傳來，吾國上下之一致快慰者，乃屬當然。惟於此應加注意者，即此次敵方來襲規模之大，遠過於以前所羅門及馬紹爾。試觀敵方空襲連續三日，旣蒙重創，猶拼力進犯，足知敵方此次雖遭敗北，今後之將出以孤注一擲，究屬意料中事。再按此次敵美第五十八機機動部隊，過去即屢於太平洋海域四出騷擾，平均軍艦載機達一千架以上，其裝備相當於美軍基準砲兵隊七十隊，及可與巨大沿岸砲臺相匹敵之巨砲等，共約八百五十門，此雖爲敵方故意誇張，然其力量之未可輕視，亦不難想像。又如日大本營發表，十四日台灣空襲之際，敵美在中國大陸方面，亦同時出動大量空軍，分襲各地，可知此次敵方海上機動部隊，乃與駐渝美空軍採取一致行動，由此亦可知大陸作戰，與太平洋作戰，原無地域之區別，亦唯有洞察現階段大東亞戰爭之情勢，及覺悟當前時局之艱巨，努力奮起，加強協力，始足圖共存共榮。日軍今次所獲戰果，斷非倖致，實由於平日舉國上下之團結苦幹，故能擊破敵方最強力之攻勢。吾人於快慰之餘，深感中日兩國全面協力，以完遂戰爭，實爲當務之急。日軍旣擔任前綫之苦戰，則吾人於後方更應加倍努力增產，化物資爲戰力，以分擔此一重責，期能適應今日苛烈戰局，而粉碎敵方之反攻企圖。苛能如此，將來更偉大戰果之獲致，實非難事，吾人願於此要請全國上下，爲國家民族之存亡着想，急速奮起。</p>
<h3>台灣東方海戰敵美失敗因素</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　台灣東方海戰，日本海空軍已予敵美艦隊以致命打擊，捷訊頻傳，我國人心異常振奮。此次敵美之所以戰敗，其原因甚多，其中尤以驕與愚兩點爲其主因。敵美自佔領塞班大宮二島後，每謂日海軍實力已喪，不足一戰，否則何以避不見面，殊不知日海軍之所以隱忍自重，養精蓄銳，正所以待機發動，將予敵美以一鼓殲滅之打擊。美方又嘗謂美海軍隨時隨地皆在準備與日軍一決雌雄，今海戰旣開，戰果已明，請問美海軍之準備何在，台灣附近自日本言之，正所謂內綫之內綫，若於陸地則堡壘重重，電綱密布，有明顯之防備。惟其在海面，故仍平靜如常，敵美無知，乃眯然東進，竄入此危險地帶，致受重創而退，反造成日本不亞於日俄戰役時之大勝利。而海軍長官傑姆斯嘗謂，與日軍交戰，宛若與一篤信宗教之信徒交戰，而非與一有理性之人類交戰，蓋我軍愈與彼接近，則彼之戰鬥愈益猛烈。日本軍人誠抱有一眞篤之信仰，此信仰即可爲東亞戰爭之勝利，亦大東亞民族解放戰之勝利。此種信仰，日益堅定，敵美之物質力，自亦有時而窮也。</p>
<h3>華北加強增產增運工作</h3>
<p>北平十八日中央社電　當此戰爭期內決戰階段之時，華北後方基地之任務，厥爲推進增產增運工作。華北最高當局，爲積極推進增產增運方策，劃分推動之專責，以期完成使命，經規定與增運有關機關責任如次：一棉花增產推進工作，由棉產改進會擔任。二小麥來榖之增產指導推進工作，由華北合作事業總會擔任。三天津地區水稻增產工作之推進，由天津米榖統制會擔任。天津地區以外之米榖增產工作，由華北合作總會系統之團體擔任。四增加甘菜生產，由華北合作事業總會，及華北棉產改進會，視地址之適宜分擔之。五小麥雜榖棉花等增產上必要土壤改良工作，由華北墾業公司擔任。六新民會及華北交通公司，必須盡可能加強協力，於增產增運之輔助工作。</p>

<h3>中央社編輯局擴大機構</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　中央電訊社自於本年五月改組·由郭秀峰·胡　洲兩氏繼任正副社長後，對於社務力謀刷新。近復鑒於戰局之日趨苛烈，爲期適應需要起見，特將南京總社編輯局機構，加以擴大。原有之整理電訊等組撤消，而於局下設整理政經地方三部，便事權集中，運用靈活。同時人事方面亦重加調整，聘許毓彬爲整理部主任，夏鐵漢爲政經部主任，金萍園爲政經部副主任，汪少江爲地方部主任。又該社原設之出版委員會，經政組爲中央社出版所，俾專責成，強化出版事業，由副社長胡瀘洲兼任所長，穆中南任編纂部主任。</p>
<h3>駐杭綏署成立</h3>
<p>杭州十八日中央社電　軍事委員會爲肅清匪類，確保杭州地區治安，使人民得以安居樂業，特設立駐杭州綏靖主任公署，特派項致莊爲主任，項氏奉委後，即派員來杭籌備，組織綏靖公署，業已擇定署址，於昨日成立，啓用關防，開始辦公。除分別呈報，函令各有關機關知照外，並佈告週知。</p>
<h3>亞琛城四郊展開肉搏戰荷境德軍作有力反攻</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊：星期二亞琛東北，雙方激戰直至深晚，美軍復獲得增援部隊，由各方對該市之廢墟發動攻勢，雙方損失均重，肉搏戰已於該市四郊展開　　里斯本十八日中央社電　齊格斐綫美軍恐懼亞琛包圍綱之崩潰，十七日下午爲防德軍之總反攻，繼續增強兵力。據前綫消息，德軍在亞琛東方及東北集中虎型戰車及自動砲之大軍，痛擊美軍包圍綱之間隙側面，拚命擴大連絡廻廊之勢力。同時亞琛市內之德軍，以寡兵與優勢之美軍對抗，已展開白熱之巷戰，亞琛全綫已突入緊迫階段。　　里斯本十八日中央社電　反軸心軍企圖佔領些爾德河口東方橋頭堡，在該地集中多數之戰車飛機，在數處局部突破成功，然遭德軍有力反攻，俘虜加拿大軍將軍一名。凱比納爾東方及萊米蒙東方敵攻勢受挫，摩塞爾溪谷附近之敵軍，數日受損甚重，梅茲西方之美第三軍，破壞軍事設施後已行撤退。</p>
<h3>洪刷新體制政局穩定</h3>
<p>敵陰謀成泡影　　柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：德外部發言人聲稱，德政界領袖對洪都醖釀之事件，及洪蘇兩國人員往來之情況，早有所聞，但以洪國族主義者，位居要衝，德國無干涉之必要。該發言人又稱，洪國內並無暴動，僅國家機構發生變動，而今洪牙利政治情形，可謂絕對穩定，非但政治如此，軍情亦然。故德洪軍隊已無後顧之憂，可安心開往前綫。當洪攝政霍爾第不能對國家盡責之時，政權已移交才力較高之青年，邱吉爾與斯達林所希冀之洪國政變竟未實現，未免使之失望也。</p>
<h3>洪新總理告軍士書</h3>
<p>洪京十八日中央社電　海通社訊：洪新總理薩拉西頒佈告軍士書，論及洪國自私之人，集合成一小團體，祗圖私利，不惜危害國家之生命，甚至攝政霍爾第被其朦蔽，亦已腐化。嗣又論及出力戰爭之需要，謂無論何人，必須盡力參加對敵作戰，軍隊要求國內人民團結一致，人民要求軍隊盡忠報國。總之，洪牙利之自由與獨立，爲吾人之目標，本人深信將與德國及其他軸心國，同向最後勝利之途邁進。</p>
<h3>斯達林邱吉爾再度會晤</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據莫斯科消息：斯達林與邱吉爾昨日再度會晤，同日英外相艾登會與波流亡總理米柯拉席克作長談，此爲艾登抵蘇後第七次與波總理會晤，英駐蘇大使冠爾及波外長羅默均參加。</p>
<h3>英蘇劃分勢力範圍</h3>
<p>日內瓦十八日中央社電　德國社訊：英作家華爾斯在觀察報評論莫斯科會談稱，英蘇兩國似已同意將歐洲劃分爲兩個利益範圍。其一，爲屬於蘇聯勢力範圍之東歐，以波蘭·捷克·羅馬尼亞·洪牙利·保加利亞及南斯拉夫之一部份屬之。其二，爲英國控制下之西歐集團，此集團包括西歐全部·地中海·希臘·及西亞。波蘭問題似尚未解決，但已不足以妨碍西歐反軸心國與蘇聯之關係。</p>
<h3>東普魯士邊境蘇軍發動攻勢</h3>
<p>波羅的局勢變更面目　　柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊，東綫北路蘇軍於砲轟之後，沿柯那斯·貢比嫩（Kaunas-Gumbinnen）鐵路之兩側，向東普魯士邊界發動攻勢，藉以解救北翼之蘇軍，而切斷該處之德軍，敵進攻之處廣達四十公里，至今猶未突入德土。華沙區蘇兵力較少，惟羅森區（Ｒozan）壓力仍未減，可見敵人具有突入東普魯士之決心。特文那區德軍繼續撤退，波羅的海區前綫形勢，已因維柯維興區（　ilkowischen）蘇軍之攻勢而變更面目。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹戰況</h3>
<p>巴爾南幹部及愛琴海方面德軍，正在移動集中，蘇軍欲加阻止，時與德後衛發生激戰。格羅斯華頓·特勃萊森區之坦克車大戰，烈勢未減，此乃洪牙利平原上典型之流動戰，雙方均圖突入對方之側翼，蘇圖向北突破被阻，故戰事中心已向南移。泰斯河區之蘇軍坦克亦已調至洪境增援，故泰斯河區之戰，已成局部性質。貝爾格勒南及尼許之戰，與前述阻止德軍集中之行動有密切關係。東貝斯基特及喀爾巴阡羅斯尼亞，蘇軍攻勢稍殺。　　柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊：南斯拉夫京城貝爾格勒已全趨平靜，該市以南之山間已無蘇軍踪跡。</p>
<h3>塞政府遷離貝爾格勒</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社　電　海通社訊：德外部發言人稱，自蘇軍侵入貝爾格勒之南部後，在尼迭資總理領導下之塞爾維亞政府，已遷離該城。惟其目的地何在，該發言人並未透露。</p>
<h3>訪問聯銀總裁汪汝璟</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>到華北方面來，第一件事使你注意的，便是過了蚌埠和徐州所通用的聯銀票。在一個國家內爲什麼要使用兩種貨幣呢？這大槪每一個中國人到北方來都要發的疑問吧！然而不管怎樣，聯銀今日已成了北方的國家銀行，它毫無疑問地已是一個[銀行之銀行]。最初它成立的時候，原由臨時政府行政委員會主席王克敏氏兼任總裁，自國府還都，臨時政府解消，王氏退隱，乃改由當時負華北財政責任的汪汝璟氏任總裁。迨五克敏氏東山再起出堂華北政委會委員長，聯銀總裁却俘由汪汝璟氏擔任，不過汪氏從那時起却把財政大權讓出，專管金融和經濟的事情，所以他現在是兼任着經濟總署督辦。</p>
<h3>瑰麗的住宅與愛美的主人</h3>
<p>一個秋天的下午，我被約定於四時三十分在汪總裁的公館去談話。汪氏今雖把華北財政大權讓出，可仍是此間金融的重鎭，所以我是必須去和他一談的。這一位聯銀總裁，在北京是有極大聲望的，大家都知道他是一位富翁，甚至一提到你是去北兵馬司胡同看汪總裁的，連洋車夫都要肅然起敬的。由此，我們也可以知道金錢在今日的威力了！　　汪氏的管邸，是在北京城北，原是過去西北軍紅人蕭振瀘氏的住宅，當然經過了汪氏的修葺，更是顯得美輪美奐了。當我一進北兵馬司胡同的時候，就見有幾個警察在巡邏，原來他那座官舍就在胡同之首端。由門警通報之後，我就被引進到一間客室，那裹儘有着一切現人化的設備。像我在上海今日所不易見到的熱水汀氣管，他那裹還依然矗立着。他那座住宅外面看起來雖然含有故都本來的古氣，可是其內部的裝璜却是十二分的瑰麗，尤其綫條的調和可稱獨步。聽說，汪總裁原是一位愛美的人，所以就是在屋子外面也都塗着碧綠顏色，很顯出在北京所不易見到的潔淨風味。　　不多一會，被稱爲[北方財神]的聯銀總裁就出來了。他給我的印象是十二分的滿意，無論從他的舉止或談吐上看，證實他是一位頂好的銀行事務家。把一位事務家來領導北方的金融，該是一件理想的事吧。可是不幸，汪氏的兩耳有些不十分方便，所以我們開始談話之時—他就要求我坐得近一些，並且時時拿手按着他的一隻比較能聽的耳朶。</p>
<h3>生產與通貨聯繫的趨勢</h3>
<p>我們會對聯銀的詳細情形反覆檢討了半個鐘頭，我認爲十分滿意。不過很抱歉，記者不容易把它一一告知讀者。但是有一件事却值得一提的，就是今的聯銀似乎漸漸地有走上生產與通貸聯繫的局勢。如果自去歲以來所實行的物資行政收買政策，眞的能獲有切實成功的話，以生產爲本位的通貸性格是不難獲致的。不過北方近來物價日趨高漲，對於經濟統制又各抱不同的見解，所以他們的努力是否成功尚屬疑問。同時關於食糧的管理，却又屬於農務總署，是以經濟總署所管轄的尚不是統制經濟之全部。北方目前的私人銀行並不像上海那麼多，似乎對於金融的檢查方面比較嚴格。現在他們規定私人開設銀行須視其存欵數目把這種條件提高至一百萬元或二百萬元不等。各私人銀行對於一切存欵放欵等均須報知聯銀，尤對放欵方面須經聯銀之核准。現在聯銀的政策，是向生產與通貸緊密聯繫的道途走去，所以對生產事業的放款特別獎勵。據汪總裁說，上月底所成立的華北工業銀行，就是想從此開始華北輕工業的建設。關於這種生產與通貸相聯繫的嘗度，我想至少中樞方面可以作爲參考的。</p>
<h3>華北財界最有功的人物</h3>
<p>最後，我還對汪總裁的過去經歷略加探問。原來汪氏原籍安微旌德·自小在南京生長。最初他原在南京的陸軍小學畢業，後來始到北京來就讀於當時的陸軍軍需學校，由是乃留學日本卒業於東京的陸軍經理學校。據他說，他自那時起就喜歡研究經濟和財政，因此返國後即入銀行界服務。開始跨入銀行界的時候，汪氏僅爲一行員，在漢口的時候當他任職於中國銀行時，會於民國十六年時與唐生智相交甚善。唐氏失敗，汪氏遠走當時東北的哈爾濱，在哈埠中國銀行任經理，不久又調至奉天。在中國銀行時代，他就受當今華北的王委員長的知遇，因此在臨時政府成立時被邀出長財政，並籌備中國聯合準備銀行的成立。這樣看起來，汪氏今雖繼王委員長任聯銀的總裁，他實在是華北財界最有功的人物，而是一位新進的理財家吧！</p>

<h3>出淵部長談東亞必勝態勢尼米茲企圖完全粉碎</h3>
<p>盟邦日本上海陸軍部報道部出淵部長，於昨（十八）日下午三時，會見本市中國新聞記者，就太平洋戰綫台東大勝，及對中國大陸戰綫之推進，發表談話如次：</p>
<h3>雷擊機隊參予決戰</h3>
<p>此次日軍在台灣東方海面及菲律賓東方海面空前大捷，擊滅敵美太平洋主力第五十八機動部隊，日本大本營於本月十三日起，賡續發表六次戰報，計擊沉擊破敵航空母艦及戰艦共計四十二艘，敵美主力憶瀕於全滅，是以今後在太平洋作戰中，敵方已遭受嚴重之打擊。根據大本營發表所述者，敵已敗退敵竄中。故如今該處之戰鬥，仍繼續進行。且敵方企圖援救敗退隊伍，竟又調動所謂之別動隊出動掩護，今後之日軍，尚有更擴大之戰果建立，此次戰果殊爲自珍珠灣以來所未見。查台東菲東海面之戰鬥，並有日陸軍雷擊機隊之參加決戰，在此戰塲上猶屬初次，受訓爲時頗短，今得在陸海雙方之協力下，獲取驚震世界之戰果，殊深爲值得注目。本月十六日小磯總理大臣特爲雷擊機隊之事實，發表談話，謂在大東亞戰史內，值得大書特書，深信陸軍雷擊機隊，在今後作戰上，當再建樹更大之功勛。</p>
<h3>大陸戰綫日軍急進</h3>
<p>再觀大陸作戰現狀，日在華派遣軍精銳部隊，自席捲湘豫戰塲，目前又轉移廣西省境，遍歷各戰塲，並對桂林柳州二大要途，已兩路夾攻。查桂林柳州爲中國西南之最大要衝，而爲敵美在渝空軍之前進根據地之一。此次夾攻，在軍事上具有重大關係，刻日軍距離桂林柳州二地非遙。自最近日陸軍與海軍之密切協力，將福州攻佔後，又逐步加以推進，擴大戰果，粉碎敵美司令長官尼米茲之企圖。查尼米茲之主張，覬觀閩省沿岸，稱在中國大陸登陸，首先須上陸福建沿岸，是以日軍爲擊破敵美企圖，先發制人，事前即將福州沿岸攻領，故敵美企圖已完全粉碎。如此次大陸戰綫之推進，突飛猛晉，渝方之[抗戰方式]，因此有所轉變。上次重慶舉行參政會議時，席間有主張民主化與東亞第二戰綫兩論，雄辯激烈非常，蓋目前大陸戰綫之日軍迅速推進，渝方尚方轉移目標之敵，因此渝有一般人深沈大陸戰綫，實爲大東亞戰爭決戰疆塲。</p>
<h3>奠定東亞必勝基礎</h3>
<p>渝方并承認不能擊敗大陸日軍，則爭取勝利前途艱難，於是英美方面藉此要求，暴露統一渝方內部之野心，鞭策渝政權供無謂犧牲，并對日作無謂作戰，在茲情形下，渝方當必然向英美要挾，尤其對美國方向，要求強化援助，因此在中國沿岸之登陸戰，美國竟不惜發動。值茲日軍在台灣東方海面獲得極大勝利之際，日軍當乘此捷報頻傳，亦當將攻勢移轉，對渝軍將作更重大之打擊。關於台東大勝，及對中國大陸之推進，確有聯擊之深長意義，惟所謂東亞第二戰綫，其素質非常脆弱，不經過大戰，渝軍即可崩潰。如今敵美在高呌登陸作戰，顯明毫無希望，在另一方面，獨裁之蔣政權，在渝各方之要求民主化下，已遭受不利之情勢，處於崩潰之階段，其前途岌岌可危，尤其圍繞在渝政權之內外情勢，深刻非常。羅斯福爲競選下屆總統，爲求掩蔽敗戰內幕，不惜海軍在此次協力下，台東之空前勝利，已奠定今後之必勝基礎，在防衛東亞上言，建成銅牆鐵壁之形勢，若敵蠢動企圖再起，日軍當決予奮勇猛擊，故敵方必失敗無疑，我人今觀中國大陸戰綫及太平洋戰綫之呼應，進展勝利，給予[抗戰]之渝方影響何等重大，深爲我人注視。</p>
<h3>保安司令部拘捕大批不法軍人被擾商店可報告究辦</h3>

<h3>決戰態勢下的德國</h3>
<p>面臨生死關頭的現階段德國，究竟怎樣？第一次世界大戰時，前綫雖強，但因後方分裂而致敗。操縱國家機構的德國猶太財閥，賺得戰爭利潤後，便向德國人民的背後刺以七首。此次德國，在發動戰爭前，先把國內的異已份子剷除一乾二淨，於是敵人鎭日渴望中的分裂危機，一次也未能實現。政府經常宣傳：[後方不要對前方掣肘]，於是國民全都肯奉公守法。與日本一樣，普天之下，全是父兄或子弟陣亡的家庭。一手握着骨肉陣亡的惡噩，一手揮着淚，走向工塲去的妻女，空襲時烈火焚身；而在寫字間辦公的老叟，心情仍不下於前方將士。大家心坎，只有一個不能再敗的觀念，在排除萬難，構成一種有力的臺柱，在支持着後方的士氣。這是沒有少壯男人的國度裹，能使一千二百萬外國工人勞動的力量，同時也是由民族活動的螺旋盤裹挑剔出腐敗份子的原動力</p>
<h3>敵方宣傳失敗</h3>
<p>最初敵方的宣傳攻勢，是千篇一律地側重於挑撥離間黨和國民以及黨和軍的，但自從去年以來，放棄了此種宣傳政策，開始說老實話的恫嚇，而說將不分彼此地粉碎納粹黨與國民全體。這是由於碰到德國人民戰意的壁壘所致。我們會經想過，德國的命運一定將決定於外國戰，但事實並未如此。艾森霍華對於萊茵和魯爾等戰區居民會用傳單或無綫電指示態度，縱令威脅利誘，也不見得有辦法。歸根結底，還需用下力直搗柏林，這樣決定的敵人，是打算徐徐迫近的。　　由於第二次奎貝克會談的結果和蘇聯的意向，或許不久即將發表解決德國的原則，但無論如何，萊茵區居民所表示的敵意與反抗，總使敵人愈深入而愈益感覺劇烈。久至五年的戰爭磨煉，轟炸所造成的強靱性，逐漸在向外表現出來，但[敗不得]和[死不得]的情緒，比[不得不勝]的情緒還要堅強。德國人民就是具有這種情緒在決心進行焦土戰術。</p>
<h3>國內陣綫統一</h3>
<p>七月二十日發動的暗殺希特勒未遂事件，少數叛逆份子業已肅清，國內陣綫統一。前方兵士，戰鬥精神從未銷沉。對於希特勒的信仰，仍然始終不渝。即從最近瑟堡·聖美羅·希勒斯特等各守備軍堅持到最後一粒子彈時，向希特勒拍電致敬，也可以看出士兵對希特勒的擁護。尤其是十七歲少年組成的白虎隊，在諾曼第戰綫上會建立了永垂史冊的偉功奇勳，而此次在德荷邊境上，會英勇地與敵方空輸部隊交綏。</p>
<h3>同仇敵愾心理</h3>
<p>試觀總力動員的國民兵團，在同仇敵愾的心理上，近一年來業已起了很大的變化。發動戰爭時，對於英美，在文化·政治·經濟等各方面都有密切接角，所以德國人民不願以爲敵。對於蘇聯則正相反，一方面由於蘇聯一向採取閉關自守政策，不與外界往來，另外就是納粹黨的反共思想和反共政策，向德國人民灌輸[俄羅斯爲東方野獸]，[西比利亞爲人間地獄]等反蘇思想，於是人民的心原裹，這種[蘇聯爲人民公敵]的思想野火，在熊熊燃燃着。所以蘇聯軍隊的乘勝前進，而德國從極度的仇視心理上產生一種威力，誓死攔阻蘇聯紅軍。但德國近來對英美的感情亦變爲惡劣，這是因爲英美非人道的空襲所致。空襲如以工塲爲目標，這因爲是軍事設施，尚有情可原，但空襲由於愈演愈烈，而競以民房，病院，學校，古蹟，文化機關爲轟炸目標，甚至近來以教堂和田野裹耕種的農夫爲機槍掃射的對象，所以德國人民對此種非人道行爲怒髪沖冠。敵人以爲空襲可以摧毀德國人民的戰意，事實正相反，反來造成德國人民空前反英美的情緒。時至今日，德國人民不僅痛恨東方的波爾什維克，同時也想寝皮食肉地痛恨西方的民主國家英美。　　妨礙希特勒的大第三帝國夢者，當然是英美蘇敵人，這種信念通過痛苦的現實而漸成爲每個德國人的信念了。所以年青的德國人，爲了恢復世界無比的大第三帝國，愈益憤激了。最近羅金堡氏會說　　[青少年藉國家社會主義的世界觀而理解了德國的歷史與傳統，同時覺醒到了自己是爲下一代德國人民的幸福而戰的。他們的戰意，是瞭解了有保守歷史，傳統，土地的必要，而始終不渝的宿命戰意。]　　我們也常常碰到他們那種超人的堅強信念，而今人驚奇不置。整個德國，現在是立於不能再退的最後防綫上了。此次戰爭，是德國人民誰都沒想過的悲慘，或許結果將與第一次大戰相同，但在德國明朗的心境這一點上說，是與第一次大戰絕對不同的。　　德意志第三帝國，是指納粹復興德國而言。納粹指十世紀時鄂圖大帝所建設的神聖羅馬帝國爲第一帝國，稱後來的畢斯麥時代的德國爲第二帝國，而現在要排除第一帝國和第二帝國的缺點，以建設純粹德意志民族的國家爲最高理想，這便是希特勒的第三帝國。（安譯自九月二十七日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>近來的青年（五）</h3>
<p>一九四二年的春天，就好像陣雨般，大步地跑來，三月底，海軍省院內的櫻花，盛開了。　　有一天早晨，隆夫覺着非常爽快，而在花業中穿過時，突然看到了飛田中校。　　[喂，烈士的共同海軍葬日期已經決定了。四月八日追悼，地點日比谷公園，喪儀指導官海軍大臣。這是廣瀕中校以來，從未有過的盛舉。]　　飛田中校認爲像是自己的事一樣，而滿面紅光地表現着喜色。　　[呵，那眞光榮！]　　隆夫的面孔，也像櫻花盛開着一樣，非常明朗舒暢。　　[你旣然是谷少校的至友，那末你可以厚着面皮列在谷少校家族席裹。]　　[是，謝謝！]　　隆夫筆着答應了。　　（在日比谷舉行海軍葬，眞是一件盛舉！）　　聯想到典禮的隆重，而隆夫的心在跳了。眞人得到這樣代價，眞令人高舉萬分。同時也想到了眞人的昇進兩級。同時，隆夫的心板上浮現出眞人蘋果的臉，揮動着手說：　　[呵，這眞夠折磨我，我實在擔當不起。]　　（是的，眞人是不喜歡別人奉承他的。）　　然而眞希望這樣鮮艷的櫻花，一直開到海軍葬舉行的日子。旣是日本國花，又是海軍花的櫻花，應當一直開着紀念九位烈士。　　但四月一日，像降雪般地開始花落了。隆夫很覺傷心，看着滿地散落的花，想到烈士們的祭文中[散落的櫻花]字句時，更覺得自己的希求是無用的。　　四月八日，櫻樹梢上已經長出嫩嫩的芽來，殘花像白的蝴蝶般留在樹上。　　這一天的早晨，隆夫用冷水揩完了身體，穿上爸爸寄來的大禮服。左臂佩帶上追悼會章時，老板娘開門說：　　[牟田口君，來客人了。]　　[唔？原來是你？]　　隆夫大聲呌出來。在走廊上出現了妹妹的面孔。她穿着春天的大衣，挾着皮包，在站着。（一五二）</p>

        <h1>1944.10.19</h1>
<h3>National Unity</h3>
<p>The war has reached a decisive stage. The national strength accumulated in peacetime requires substantial replenishment due to the extensive consumption over a long period. The people of the entire nation are the source of replenishing and revitalizing the country's strength. The degree of national cooperation determines the amount of increase in national power, and whether the government's guidance of the people is sound is the deciding factor on whether the people can cooperate.</p>
<p>After returning from Japan, Information Minister Matsudaira gave a speech, stating that the thorough implementation of the "national diligence" spirit in Japan has solidified the total national power, creating a great and precious achievement in this era. He cited an example of a place in Japan where, on a barren field of reeds, the people worked tirelessly, day and night, clearing the land and eventually creating a dockyard, building over eighty wooden ships. This demonstrates the spirit of human determination prevailing over nature, and represents national cooperation.</p>
<p>Why are the Japanese people able to cooperate so well in national affairs? First, it is the self-awareness of the people themselves; second, it is the effective leadership of the government. Elder Tokutomi Sohō's four major demands on the government are: to trust the people, to respect the people, to listen to the voices of the people, and to implement politics based on the people. When promoting national cooperation, it is important to highlight its importance. Only with a government that works for the people above can there be people who work for the nation below. If the government belongs to the people and cares for the people, then the people will naturally obey and care for the government. This is the natural principle of populism, and "the people are the foundation of the nation, and a strong foundation ensures national peace" is a famous maxim from Chinese dynasties.</p>
<p>Looking at the efforts of the Allies, everyone should have a profound realization. During this decisive period, the government must do its best to utilize the strength of the people. The government can also punish citizens who do not contribute. The question is how the government should act. Mencius said, "If rulers use people with ease, though they labor, they do not complain; if they put people to death when they might live, though they die, they do not hate those who put them to death." This is such an ideal scene. When Zhuge Liang governed with penalties, he was sincere, impartial, strict in regulations, fair in rewards and punishments, punished all evils, promoted all good, did not tolerate corruption, and encouraged self-improvement. Therefore, he maintained internal peace among the populace and defended against external aggression. This is the best way to govern and use the people. His seven captures of Meng Huo and six expeditions to Qishan were national wars executed with the cooperation of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Governing a country with the people's well-being as the top priority is a universal principle, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. This principle allows people to work for national construction in peacetime with peace of mind and sacrifice for the country willingly in times of war. The severity of modern warfare cannot be compared to ancient times, so modern nations need the strength of their people even more than ancient nations. To make the people work without complaint and die without resentment, the government needs to make even more efforts for the people. There is no other way. This is the essence of people-based politics, and its effectiveness can be seen clearly in the Allied nations.</p>
<p>China has been at war for nearly two years. We, the people, are ashamed that we cannot contribute more, and our government should reflect on why it cannot lead the people to contribute. In this decisive period, every Chinese citizen should contribute their strength. However, in a situation where the people have the strength but no way to exert it, and the government wants to lead but cannot find a way, everyone must look to history, the current situation in various countries around the world, and all the national and people-oriented measures of our ally Japan, to seek a lesson and find a way out. National cooperation is urgently needed. How the people can cooperate and how the government can lead the people to cooperate are even more pressing issues.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Will Exert Maximum Power in the Pacific, Soviet Military Expert Discusses Difficulties of US Attack on Philippines</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Soviet military expert Xiang Ermashiv recently published an article in the naval journal "The Fleet," titled "The Philippine Operation." The gist of the article is as follows: The purpose of the American landing on Peleliu Island is to control the Palau Islands as a base for attacking the Philippines. However, the American operation in the Philippines still faces many difficulties. The important American base on the west coast of the United States is far from both Hawaii and Australia. Therefore, the American military intends to build a large supply base in the Palau Islands. Moreover, the Japanese army not only has a large number of troops in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, but also has very abundant reserves. Therefore, the operation in the Philippines is more difficult than any previous operation. At the end of September, the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau listed the advantages of the anti-Axis forces in the war against Japan and detailed the advantages of the Japanese army, stating that Japan has the ability to increase the production of various military supplies, and has a large stockpile of food, weapons, manufactured goods, and raw materials. The Japanese navy can still exert its maximum power.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a New York dispatch, the Current Affairs Debate Conference hosted by the U.S. Weekly magazine began on the 16th. At the conference, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz broadcast a speech from Pearl Harbor, stating: The path to victory in the war against Japan is still long and there are many dangers. We must realize that the war in the Pacific will take a long time. This is a conclusion based on facts, based on geography, topography, and the facts of the ships that can be used, and the facts of army and navy strategy. The progress of the war will require great efforts in the future, which is what is required of the entire nation.</p>
<h3>German Navy Commander-in-Chief Sends Telegram to Congratulate Japanese Navy Minister on Great Victory, Germans Excited</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Haito News Agency: German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Dönitz sent a telegram to the Japanese Navy Minister to congratulate him. The full text reads: "On behalf of the German military, I would like to congratulate Your Excellency on the great victory of the Imperial Navy over the enemy fleet in Taiwan. This victory, in our common war against the illegal demands of Britain and America, undoubtedly inflicts a major blow to the American fleet. The German Navy is overjoyed at the news. This victory is nothing less than a stimulant for us."</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Report on Japanese Military Achievements</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German newspapers on the 17th continuously reported on the great war results of the Japanese Navy in the waters east of Taiwan. The Berlin Evening News published an article stating that Roosevelt should recognize Japan's determination and strength. When Nimitz repeatedly reported to the country that the US Navy had not been defeated in Taiwan, it had already suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army. This fact may have made it difficult for him to speak. Nimitz once sang that it is still difficult to win the war against Japan, and ending the war as soon as possible is a wrong idea. The American offensive in the Pacific is the opposite of what Roosevelt and others expected.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army achieved a great victory in the waters east of Taiwan, Prime Minister Zhang issued a statement expressing Manchukuo's determination to complete the war. He said that the Japanese army and navy, who had been patiently waiting for an opportunity, counterattacked the enemy forces with swift force and achieved great victories. The Japanese General Headquarters has already announced this. The good strategy and brave battles of the Japanese army and navy will certainly be deeply appreciated by the nations of East Asia. However, the decisive battle begins today. Starting with this victory, the counterattack is an excellent opportunity to prevent the enemy from having any opportunity to attack. Therefore, we must concentrate all the power of the nation on strengthening our war capabilities in order to thoroughly supply the front lines. Now, we are in the midst of a bountiful autumn and will begin "purchasing." Also, the production of coal, iron, and aircraft is being greatly increased through the efforts of production personnel. We are truly grateful for this.</p>
<h3>Japan Is Making Continued Efforts Throughout The Country</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Information Officer Yoko of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, when meeting with the Chinese Journalists Corps stationed in Japan on the 18th, gave a special statement on the naval battle off Taiwan. The gist of his remarks was as follows: Roosevelt, in order to make the fourth election favorable, disregarded strategy and attacked Taiwan, attempting to show a force militarily, in order to promote national concern. As a result, the attempt failed and suffered a disastrous defeat. As a result, the main force of the 58th Mobile Task Force was almost wiped out by the Japanese army, resulting in a significant impact. On the contrary, the Japanese Navy, which had been enduring and self-respecting, had almost exhausted itself, and public opinion had already shown that the opportunity to seize the opportunity, launch a large-scale counter-offensive, and harvest unprecedented and glorious war results in the history of warfare, was extremely rare. The Japanese traditional naval spirit has been completely revealed in this naval battle. As a result of this war result, domestic morale has suddenly become clear. After Prime Minister Koiso of Japan came to power, the goal of clear and open-minded people's sentiment has been completely achieved in the military. However, the Japanese people all know that this war result is by no means the final victory, so the whole country, taking the last victory as a turning point, is making continued efforts to achieve the second and third victories.</p>
<h3>Enemy U.S. Mobile Task Force Attack On Taiwan Purpose</h3>
<p>Japanese Naval Experts Disclose</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ito Masanori, a well-known Japanese naval military expert, recently gave a statement on the strategic intentions of the US Fifth Eighth Mobile Task Force's air raid on Taiwan, as follows: The fact that the enemy's large-scale air raid on Taiwan this time was more than worth the loss has been recognized by the world. The purpose of the enemy's air raid on Taiwan was, first, to detect the strength of the Japanese army's</p>
<h3>Homeland Defense</h3>
<p>The truth or falsity of money, secondly, in an attempt to destroy the aviation base facilities on Taiwan Island. In other words, the purpose of the enemy army is to detect the strength of the Japanese army and destroy the Japanese army's air power. The most important part of the enemy's naval strategy is to attempt to destroy the Japanese combined team in the south, which is exactly the same as the Japanese army's hope to destroy the US Navy. However, its current combat method is to induce the Japanese army to a sea battle hundreds of kilometers to thousands of kilometers away, at a time before and after the large-scale landing operations in the Philippines or the Ogasawara Islands. There is no doubt that one of the major obstacles to its combat is that Taiwan is the accumulation point of base air power. If the Japanese army ensures great combat power here, the enemy's southern operations will have to be vigilant. The power of Taiwan cannot be detected by spies. Only</p>
<h3>Absolute Strength</h3>
<p>Can reveal its inside story, which is the point of operational value. Therefore, the attack on October 12 can be said to be a natural act. After the end of the first day, the attack was continued on the 13th. If they had retreated early, it would have been clever, but in the end they were too greedy and were severely hit by the Japanese army. The main force of the enemy's important mobile task force has suffered a fatal blow. The enemy knows that when the Japanese and US forces launch a naval battle in the south, the Japanese army will effectively use the base air force, so the enemy's second purpose had to launch this offensive. However, as a result, the loss of the Japanese army was completely different from what the enemy had expected. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the sinking of the Prince of Wales by the Japanese army was of course also due to the base air power. Therefore, the US military of course planned to prevent</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Sinks</h3>
<p>Its fleet aircraft carrier-centered air raid forces and bases. In the battle between the Air Force and the Air Force, even if the forces are not significantly different, the land side is absolutely advantageous to the sea. The advantage is that it is easy to make a surprise attack, and at the same time, it can exert the characteristics of maneuverability, that is, it is easy to get away after the air raid. If you want to attack two or three times, you will expose the weakness of the naval force. Moreover, the Japanese elite is secretly waiting for orders. Taiwan is the largest air base. Japan has already formed a base here and has also prepared a support system. In other words, if the enemy attacks Taiwan, the Japanese army will take a siege formation within a considerable period of time. Therefore, no matter which base the enemy attempts to air raid, it will suffer a major blow. This victory is believed to be</p>
<h3>This Great War</h3>
<p>The victory, we must prepare considerable forces to wait for the enemy to replenish and then invade again. After this great victory, we must raise the fighting spirit of the generals and soldiers. At the same time, we must gather considerable forces, at the right time and place, to launch a great battle in one fell swoop. For this, we need an increase in the production of excellent aircraft and the cooperation of the army and navy commanders. That is, Japan must win tactically and strategically. Japan must always grasp the above conditions. In short, Japan must prepare to crush the enemy's repeated air raids at any time in the future, give them heavy blows on time, and advance the war based on this belief.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on Peleliu Island Launch Night Attack on Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the Central Pacific, the Japanese troops on Peleliu Island, since the 12th, have been increasingly invigorated by the great victory of the Japanese Navy on the sea off Taiwan. They still hold the central highlands, and every night they break into enemy positions and kill many enemy troops. Due to the continuous attacks of the Japanese troops, the first-line enemy soldiers are extremely exhausted and have to be replaced by reinforcements. The Japanese troops took the opportunity to attack. On the afternoon of the 16th, there was a small-scale battle on the side of Mount Suifu, and there was little change in other areas.</p>
<h3>Envoy Kusumoto's Speech</h3>
<p>Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - The new Japanese envoy to Beiping, Lieutenant General Kusumoto Sanetaka, said in Xinjing a few days ago that he had worked in Shanghai before the China Incident, and then, as the head of the unit, he had fought in various parts of Central China. This is his first time being appointed to North China. North China, which is on the path of construction, has various important problems at present, whether in terms of security or economy. However, the most important thing is to win the war. All policies must be focused on this point, and we must not be bound by trivial matters. He is determined to work with China to fulfill the common goal and do his best. In addition, the envoy is scheduled to leave Manchuria around the 20th, return to his country, and then take office.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Stationed In Chongqing Suffers Major Blow</h3>
<p>Raid on Guangzhou U.S. Aircraft Foiled</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The integrated main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet has been annihilated since the 12th due to the Japanese army's continuous launch of naval and air operations. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing came to attack Taiwan in order to respond to the main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet. The enemy's Pacific Fleet came to attack, which is noteworthy in this operation. About 1,100 enemy aircraft attacked various parts of Taiwan on the 12th, a small part of which were B24 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. About 100 enemy aircraft attacked Taiwan on the 14th, which were B29 aircraft. However, the enemy B24 aircraft formation that attacked on the 12th only carried out unsystematic indiscriminate bombing with a small number of enemy aircraft. However, although 100 B29 aircraft came to attack on the 14th, they fled after a while and did not drop any bombs. From this point of view, the reason why the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing's attempt failed was mainly due to the continuous launch of great operations by the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, which caused the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to retreat far into the interior. As for the enemy's B29 aircraft, which the enemy boasted to be a super-fortified fortress, its fragility was exposed after being hit by the Japanese new fighter jets during the second attack on Kyushu. That is, 100 enemy B29 aircraft that attacked Taiwan on the 14th finally collapsed and did not gain anything. The reason is probably because the enemy is afraid of Japanese new fighter jets. In short, in this naval and air battle, the enemy's US Air Force's cooperation with the enemy's mobile task force can be said to be a joint operation in operation, but it is meaningless, but only a completely unsystematic independent action with minimal effect has come, and by this time the enemy's mobile task force has been annihilated, and its ability to respond to the cooperative US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has also been lost here. A certain base on the front line of the Japanese army, 18th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 17th, around 3:15, the Chongqing US Air Force used a mixed formation of about 16 bombers B24 and B25, and about 20 fighters P51 and P40, totaling about 40 aircraft, to air raid the Guangzhou area. After being intercepted by Japanese air defense artillery and fighter groups, three P51s were shot down and one P55 was destroyed. The rest fled in panic along the West River towards Zhaoqing. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle. Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported that three P40 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Danzhu around 12:30 on the afternoon of the 17th and were intercepted by Japanese troops, and one of them was shot down.</p>

<h3>Recent War Results of Japanese Army in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese Army in mainland China, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army's interception of incoming enemy reinforcements in southern China has recently resulted in even greater war results. It is estimated that in the air battle over Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 15th, nine enemy fighter-bombers were destroyed, and four Japanese aircraft did not return, but the pilots of two of them survived. In addition to the above-mentioned war results, it is said that one P51 aircraft was also shot down. Also, on the 16th, when enemy aircraft attacked Gaotuan, two B24 aircraft were shot down (one of which was not confirmed), and several other enemy aircraft were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Enemy-US Fuzhou Plot Fails</h3>
<p>Mainland Base, 18th (Central News Agency) - The rumor of enemy-US unrest in the Fuzhou area once became popular in the past. After the Japanese army occupied Fuzhou, it was judged that the US military intended to set up a submarine base in that area, and began to send about 50 surveying technicians to the Fuzhou area to conduct investigations. Most of the surveying and investigation documents have been discovered and confiscated by the Japanese army. In addition, wireless radios and letters used by British and Americans to collect information with Fuzhou as a base were also found, which further proves the correctness of the incident.</p>

Recently, they have been dispatched with mobile units to the operating sea. They can carry 30 aircraft and their main task is to transport aircraft and guard against submarines. At present, the United States has about 50 to 60 such aircraft carriers.</p>

<h3>Close Combat Breaks Out on the Outskirts of Aachen; German Forces in the Netherlands Launch a Strong Counterattack</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: On Tuesday, fierce fighting raged in the northeast of Aachen until late at night. American forces received reinforcements and launched an offensive on the ruins of the city from all directions. Both sides suffered heavy losses, and close combat has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Fearing the collapse of the Aachen encirclement, American forces continued to reinforce their troops on the afternoon of the 17th to prevent a general German counterattack. According to front-line reports, German forces concentrated large numbers of Tiger tanks and self-propelled guns east and northeast of Aachen, fiercely attacking the gaps on the flanks of the American encirclement in an effort to expand the corridor of communication. At the same time, German forces inside Aachen are resisting the superior American forces with a small number of troops, and fierce street fighting has broken out. The entire Aachen front has entered a critical stage. Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Anti-Axis forces attempted to occupy the eastern bridgehead of the Scheldt estuary, concentrating a large number of tanks and aircraft in the area. They achieved several local breakthroughs, but were met with a strong German counterattack, and a Canadian general was captured. Enemy offensives east of Kébir Canal and east of Laermy Mount were thwarted. Enemy forces near the Moselle Valley suffered heavy losses in recent days, and the American Third Army west of Metz has withdrawn after destroying military facilities.</p>
<h3>Hongarian Regime Refreshed and Political Situation Stabilized</h3>
<p>Enemy Conspiracy Foiled</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: A German foreign ministry spokesman stated that German political leaders were aware of the events brewing in Hungary and the interactions between Hungarian and Soviet personnel, but because Hungarian nationalists held key positions, Germany had no need to interfere. The spokesman also stated that there was no riot in Hungary, only a change in the national structure. Today, the political situation in Hungary can be described as absolutely stable, not only politically, but also militarily. Therefore, the German and Hungarian armies have no worries and can safely go to the front. When Hungarian Regent Horthy could no longer fulfill his national responsibilities, political power was transferred to younger people with greater abilities. The Hungarian coup that Churchill and Stalin had hoped for did not materialize, which cannot but disappoint them.</p>
<h3>New Hungarian Prime Minister's Letter to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The new Hungarian Prime Minister Szálasi issued a letter to the soldiers, discussing that selfish people in Hungary have formed a small group that only seeks private gain, regardless of harming the life of the country, and even Regent Horthy was blinded by them and corrupted. He then discussed the need to contribute to the war, saying that no matter who, they must do their best to participate in the war against the enemy. The army demands that the people of the country unite, and the people demand that the army be loyal and serve the country. In short, the freedom and independence of Hungary is our goal, and I firmly believe that we will advance with Germany and other Axis countries towards final victory.</p>
<h3>Stalin and Churchill Meet Again</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources: Stalin and Churchill met again yesterday. On the same day, British Foreign Secretary Eden had a long conversation with Polish Prime Minister-in-Exile Mikolajczyk. This was Eden's seventh meeting with the Polish Prime Minister since arriving in the Soviet Union. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr and Polish Foreign Minister Romer also participated.</p>
<h3>Britain and Soviet Union Divide Spheres of Influence</h3>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: British writer Wells commented on the Moscow talks in the Observer, saying that Britain and the Soviet Union seem to have agreed to divide Europe into two spheres of influence. One is Eastern Europe, which belongs to the Soviet sphere of influence, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and part of Yugoslavia. The second is the Western European group under British control, which includes all of Western Europe, the Mediterranean, Greece, and West Asia. The Polish issue does not seem to have been resolved, but it is not enough to hinder the relationship between the Western anti-Axis countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch Offensive on East Prussian Border</h3>
<p>The Situation in the Baltic Region Changes</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: After a bombardment, Soviet forces on the northern front of the Eastern Front launched an offensive along both sides of the Kaunas-Gumbinnen railway towards the East Prussian border, in order to relieve the Soviet forces on the northern flank and cut off the German forces there. The enemy's attack covers a width of 40 kilometers, but has not yet broken into German territory. Soviet forces in the Warsaw area are fewer, but the pressure in the Rozan area has not diminished, indicating that the enemy is determined to break into East Prussia. German forces in the Tvenna area continue to retreat. The front-line situation in the Baltic Sea region has changed due to the offensive of the Soviet forces in the Wilkowischen area.</p>
<h3>Situation in the Balkans</h3>
<p>German forces in the southern Balkan region and the Aegean Sea are moving and concentrating. Soviet forces are trying to stop them, and fierce battles are taking place with the German rearguard. The tank battle in the Groswardein-Debrecen area continues unabated. This is a typical mobile war on the Hungarian plains, with both sides trying to break into each other's flanks. The Soviet attempt to break through to the north was blocked, so the center of the war has shifted south. Soviet tanks from the Tisza River area have also been transferred to Hungary as reinforcements, so the battle in the Tisza River area has become localized. The battles south of Belgrade and Niš are closely related to the aforementioned actions to prevent the concentration of German forces. In Eastern Beskids and Carpathian Rosnia, the Soviet offensive has slowed slightly. Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, has become completely calm. There are no traces of Soviet forces in the mountains south of the city.</p>
<h3>Serbian Government Moves Away from Belgrade</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: A German foreign ministry spokesman said that after Soviet forces invaded the south of Belgrade, the Serbian government led by Prime Minister Nedić has moved away from the city. However, the spokesman did not reveal its destination.</p>
<h3>Visiting Mr. Wang Rujing, President of the United Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes you when you come to North China is the United Reserve Bank notes used between Bengbu and Xuzhou. Why are two currencies used in one country? This is probably the question that every Chinese person asks when they come to the north! However, regardless, the United Reserve Bank has become the national bank of North China today, and it is undoubtedly a [bank of banks]. When it was first established, it was originally concurrently headed by Wang Kemin, Chairman of the Provisional Government's Administrative Committee. After the National Government returned to the capital and the Provisional Government dissolved, Wang retired, and Wang Rujing, who was then responsible for North China's finances, was appointed President. Later, when Mr. Wang Kemin made a comeback and became Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, Wang Rujing remained as President of the United Reserve Bank. However, from that time on, Wang relinquished financial power and specialized in financial and economic matters, so he is now also serving as the Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department.</p>
<h3>A Magnificent Residence and an Aesthetic Owner</h3>
<p>One autumn afternoon, I was scheduled to speak with President Wang at his residence at 4:30 PM. Although Wang has now relinquished the financial power of North China, he is still an important figure in the financial world here, so I had to talk to him. This president of the United Reserve Bank has a very high reputation in Beijing. Everyone knows that he is a wealthy man, and even when you mention that you are going to see President Wang in Beibingmasi Hutong, the rickshaw pullers will be in awe. From this, we can also see the power of money today! Wang's residence is in the north of Beijing, originally the residence of Xiao Zhenlu, a popular figure in the former Northwest Army. Of course, after Wang's renovation, it looks even more magnificent. When I entered Beibingmasi Hutong, I saw several policemen patrolling. It turned out that his official residence was at the head of the hutong. After being reported by the guard, I was led into a guest room, which was fully equipped with all the modern conveniences. The hot water radiators, which are not easy to see in Shanghai today, were still standing there. Although the outside of his residence has the original ancient charm of the old capital, the interior decoration is extremely magnificent, especially the harmony of the lines can be called unique. It is said that President Wang is originally a person who loves beauty, so even the outside of the house is painted in emerald green, which shows a clean flavor that is not easy to see in Beijing. After a short while, the President of the United Reserve Bank, known as the [God of Wealth of the North], came out. He gave me a very satisfactory impression. Whether from his demeanor or conversation, he proved to be a very good banker. It would be ideal to have a businessman lead the finances of the North. Unfortunately, Wang's ears are not very convenient, so when we started talking, he asked me to sit closer and often held his hand on one ear that could hear better.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Linking Production and Currency</h3>
<p>We reviewed the detailed situation of the United Reserve Bank repeatedly for half an hour, and I was very satisfied. However, I am very sorry that it is not easy for the reporter to tell the readers everything. But one thing is worth mentioning, that is, today's United Reserve Bank seems to be gradually moving towards a situation of linking production and currency lending. If the policy of administrative purchase of materials implemented since last year can really achieve practical success, the character of currency lending based on production is not difficult to achieve. However, commodity prices in the North have been rising sharply recently, and there are different views on economic control, so it is still doubtful whether their efforts will succeed. At the same time, the management of food is under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Affairs Department, so the Economic Affairs Department does not manage the entire controlled economy. There are not as many private banks in the North as there are in Shanghai, and it seems that the inspection of finance is stricter. Now they stipulate that private individuals opening banks must increase the number of deposits to one million or two million yuan, depending on the number of deposits. All private banks must report all deposits and loans to the United Reserve Bank, especially loans must be approved by the United Reserve Bank. The current policy of the United Reserve Bank is to move towards a close link between production and currency lending, so it particularly encourages loans to production enterprises. According to President Wang, the North China Industrial Bank, which was established at the end of last month, wants to start the construction of North China's light industry from this. Regarding this attempt to link production and currency lending, I think the central government can at least use it as a reference.</p>
<h3>The Most Meritorious Figure in the North China Financial World</h3>
<p>Finally, I also asked about President Wang's past experience. Originally, Wang was from Jingde, Anhui, and grew up in Nanjing. At first, he graduated from the Nanjing Army Primary School, and later came to Beijing to study at the then Army Quartermaster School, and then went to Japan to graduate from the Tokyo Army Management School. According to him, he liked to study economics and finance from that time on, so after returning to China, he entered the banking industry. When he first entered the banking industry, Wang was only a bank clerk. When he was working at the Bank of China in Hankou, he had a very good relationship with Tang Shengzhi in 1927. Tang failed, and Wang went to Harbin in the northeast at that time, and served as the manager of the Bank of China in Harbin. Soon after, he was transferred to Fengtian. During his time at the Bank of China, he was known to Wang, the current chairman of North China, so he was invited to head the finances and prepare for the establishment of the China United Reserve Bank when the Provisional Government was established. Looking at it this way, although Wang is now the president of the United Reserve Bank, succeeding Chairman Wang, he is indeed the most meritorious figure in the North China financial world, and a new financial manager!</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen Orders the Materials Allocation Office to Distribute Rice as Scheduled; This Term's Registered Rice Will Be Available for Sale Within Days</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in the city has been rising daily, which has stimulated other prices to rise across the board. This not only severely threatens the livelihoods of ordinary people, but also has a huge impact on the stability of the rear economy and the supply of military needs during the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. Mayor Chen is extremely concerned about this. In addition to ordering the city's Price Review Committee to convene an emergency meeting immediately to discuss effective measures, he also ordered the Materials Allocation Office to find ways to distribute rice on schedule in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and benefit military needs. The city's registered rice will continue to be processed by the City Materials Allocation Office. The designated rice retail outlets throughout the city have been processing rice sales since the 16th, and will be widely available for sale within days with the 23rd Comprehensive Joint Ticket, with each person still receiving two shi sheng.</p>
<h3>Decision on the Transportation of Vietnamese Rice Submitted to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce decided at its first joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors to request that the Rice Control Association quickly assist in transporting Saigon rice from Annam using sailboats, following the example of transporting Taiwanese sugar, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The association submitted the case to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification and implementation by the Rice and Grain Control Association. Recently, a notice was received from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, according to the Rice Control Association's official letter No. 429, which stated: [This association's control work has always focused on domestic rice. Now, the City Chamber of Commerce suggests transporting Vietnamese rice to relieve people's food difficulties. However, since this matter involves the entire control policy, we have sent a letter to the Ministry of Commerce for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. We will comply accordingly.]</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association Expands Membership</h3>
<p>Fundraising to Purchase Coarse Grains for Affordable Retail Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, in order to promote its work, elected Li Sihao as Vice Chairman at the 13th Board of Directors meeting. The original Vice Chairman Lin Kanghou was changed to Secretary-General, and Xiang Kangyuan and Gu Nanqun were added as Deputy Secretaries-General. On the afternoon of the 17th, the 14th Board of Directors meeting was held, attended by Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Fei Yunqing, Chen Shaowei, Wang Boyuan, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Chen Binhe, etc., chaired by Chairman Wen Lanting. In order to strengthen its forces and strengthen its organization, the association decided to expand the number of members, soliciting new members, and raising funds of 5 million yuan to increase staff and improve work efficiency. The association also, in view of the panic over food in the city, intends to raise funds of 50 million yuan to purchase coarse grains from producing areas for affordable retail sales in order to relieve ordinary people. It was decided to publicly elect three directors, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, and Gu Nanqun, to plan fundraising methods. The association also plans to contact the Prevention Division of the City Police Bureau to accept citizens' complaints and mediate disputes on their behalf. It is also heard that the association will hold a general membership meeting in the near future.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a trend of bicycle thefts in the city. Each police branch reports an average of at least a dozen bicycle theft cases every day, which is truly alarming. The thieves' skills are very skillful. Each thief must carry a sharp chisel. Although the owner uses two iron chains to lock the bicycle, it is ineffective. The thief can still cut the chain. The authorities are currently preparing countermeasures and conducting secret investigations. After stealing the bicycles, these thieves will scrape off the hard prints on the bicycles, disassemble them into several parts, secretly transport the parts to the secondhand dealers west of the Shanghai-West Railway, and then resell them several times, transport them to other ports, combine the parts into a complete bicycle, and sell them repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Factory Electricity Consumption Investigation Team Does Not Interfere in External Affairs</h3>
<p>The City Economic Bureau, together with the Central China Water and Electricity Company and the City Public Works Bureau, organized a factory production electricity consumption investigation team, divided into three groups, each with three members. They began their investigation on the 11th of this month to investigate the production volume and electricity consumption of various factories, report the facts to the competent authorities, and await their disposition. This is the mission entrusted to the investigators. As for matters outside the scope of the investigation, it is not appropriate for the members of the groups to interfere, and the factories should not have any contact with them. This matter concerns the vital interests of manufacturers, and it is hoped that all manufacturers in the city will pay attention.</p>

At the same time, yellow and white lines will be drawn on the roads at the intersections of major traffic roads to stipulate the parking locations of vehicles. The police bureau will also invite the press to expand publicity and broadcast on the radio, so as to make citizens pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Minister Idebuchi Discusses the Inevitable Victory of East Asia; Nimitz's Attempt to Be Completely Crushed</h3>
<p>Minister Idebuchi of the Press Department of the Allied Japan Shanghai Army Department met with Chinese news reporters in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday (18th) to discuss the great victory in the Taiwan East Sea on the Pacific Front and the advancement of the war on the Chinese mainland, and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Torpedo Squadron Participates in Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>In the unprecedented victory of the Japanese army in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the eastern waters of the Philippines, the enemy's main Pacific Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force was destroyed. The Japanese General Headquarters has successively released six war reports since the 13th of this month, reporting a total of 42 enemy aircraft carriers and battleships sunk and destroyed. The enemy's main force is on the verge of complete annihilation. Therefore, in the Pacific operations from now on, the enemy has suffered a serious blow. According to the announcement by the General Headquarters, the enemy has been defeated and is fleeing. Therefore, the battle there is still ongoing. Moreover, the enemy attempted to rescue the defeated troops and even mobilized the so-called separate force to cover their retreat. The Japanese army will establish even greater war results in the future. This battle result is unprecedented since Pearl Harbor. The battle in the Taiwan East Sea and the Philippine East Sea also involved the participation of the Japanese Army Torpedo Squadron in the decisive battle. This was the first time on this battlefield. They received relatively short training. Today, with the cooperation of both the army and the navy, they have achieved world-shaking war results, which is deeply noteworthy. On the 16th of this month, Prime Minister Koiso specifically made a statement on the facts of the Torpedo Squadron, saying that it is worthy of a big book in the history of the Greater East Asia War, and he is confident that the Army Torpedo Squadron will make even greater contributions in future operations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Advances Rapidly on Mainland Front</h3>
<p>Looking at the current situation on the mainland front, the elite troops of the Japanese army stationed in China, after sweeping through the Hunan-Henan battlefields, are now transferring to Guangxi Province, traversing various battlefields, and attacking Guilin and Liuzhou, two major thoroughfares, from two directions. Guilin and Liuzhou are the largest key points in southwestern China and one of the advanced bases of the US Air Force in Chongqing. This attack has major implications militarily. The Japanese army is now not far from Guilin and Liuzhou. Since the recent close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy, after occupying Fuzhou, they have gradually advanced, expanded the results of the war, and crushed the plans of the enemy US Commander-in-Chief Nimitz. Nimitz's claim was to covet the coastal areas of Fujian Province, claiming that landing on the Chinese mainland must first be landed on the coast of Fujian. Therefore, in order to defeat the enemy US plans, the Japanese army took preemptive action and occupied the coastal areas of Fuzhou in advance, so the enemy US plans have been completely crushed. As the advancement of the mainland front has been so rapid, the [resistance method] of Chongqing has changed accordingly. At the last session of the National Political Council held in Chongqing, there were arguments for democratization and the second East Asian front, which were very fierce. This is because the Japanese army is rapidly advancing on the current mainland front, and Chongqing has enemies who are shifting their goals. Therefore, some people in Chongqing deeply believe that the mainland front is the decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Laying the Foundation for Inevitable Victory in East Asia</h3>
<p>If the Chongqing side admits that it cannot defeat the Japanese army on the mainland, the prospect of striving for victory will be arduous. Thus, the British and American sides are taking this opportunity to make demands, exposing the ambition of unifying the Chongqing side internally, and urging the Chongqing regime to make meaningless sacrifices and wage meaningless warfare against Japan. Under these circumstances, the Chongqing side will inevitably exert pressure on Britain and America, especially on the United States, demanding strengthened assistance. Therefore, the United States does not hesitate to launch a landing operation on the Chinese coast. At a time when the Japanese army has achieved a great victory on the sea east of Taiwan, the Japanese army should take advantage of this frequent news of victory and shift its offensive, launching a more significant blow against the Chongqing army. The great victory in Taiwan and the advance on mainland China indeed have profound and far-reaching implications. However, the so-called East Asian Second Front is very fragile, and the Chongqing army could collapse without a major battle. Now, the enemy's landing operation in the Kochi area clearly shows no hope. On the other hand, the dictatorial Chiang regime is facing unfavorable circumstances under the demand for democratization from various parties in Chongqing, and is in a state of collapse, its future precarious. In particular, the internal and external situation surrounding the Chongqing regime is extremely profound. Roosevelt, in order to run for the next presidential election and conceal the inside story of defeats, does not hesitate to use the navy in this cooperation. The unprecedented victory east of Taiwan has laid the foundation for inevitable victory in the future. In terms of defending East Asia, it has built a copper wall and iron barrier. If the enemy makes a foolish move to attempt a resurgence, the Japanese army will certainly launch a brave and fierce attack, so there is no doubt that the enemy will fail. We are now observing the coordination and progress of victory on the Chinese mainland front and the Pacific front, and deeply note the significance of the impact on the Chongqing side [resisting Japan].</p>
<h3>Security Command Arrests Large Numbers of Unlawful Soldiers, Shops Harassed Can Report for Investigation</h3>
<p>It has been found that in the central area of this city, major hotels, restaurants, wine shops, and entertainment venues have recently been frequented by unscrupulous soldiers and stragglers who are using pretexts to cause disturbances and provoke quarrels, even gathering large groups to intimidate, extort, and blackmail with weapons. These acts are blatant and unbridled, causing unspeakable suffering to the victimized merchants and residents. The detective team of the city's Security Command learned of this matter and immediately dispatched personnel to search and arrest suspects in various locations on the Double Ten Festival. They have successively detained seventeen individuals claiming to be officers and soldiers of the Suppression of Bandits Army of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui: Zhang Zhanyuan, Zhang Hengyi, Geng Yitang, Mao Tiemei, Wang Yang, Shen Yi, Wang Zhonglie, Su Xingbei, Xu Yinshun, Lü Jingfang, Lin Jinf, Sun Zhengfu, Tang Maotou, Zhou Guoliang, Tang Xiangchun, Wang Shoulun, and Jin Wenbiao. They confiscated one Mauser pistol, six rounds of ammunition, and one Italian-made pistol (5966), four rounds of ammunition, which have been submitted to the Legal Department of the Command for interrogation. Hereafter, if any shops in the city encounter similar incidents, please report directly to the Duty Officer's Office of the Security Command at telephone number 23167, or extension 23167-7, and at night, directly dial the detective team at 23164. Personnel will be dispatched immediately to arrest and investigate. Please note this information to all sectors.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Fire Refugees Petition the Authorities</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the 12th of this month, a fire broke out at the Jin Situ Temple in Tangjiaqiao, Shanghai West, spreading to the Dadeliyigongli city-owned houses, and also burning down cloth factories such as Xieda Xinshengji, etc. The victims include 56 households of residents in Dadelili and 17 households of old and young residents in Yigongli, who are without clothing or food, and their situation is quite miserable. The victims believe that the cause of the fire was due to the carelessness of the newly installed chimney of the adjacent China Condensed Milk Factory. They have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court according to law. Recently, victim representatives Zhao Bingnan, Yuan Zizuo, Cheng Suzhen, and more than 50 others submitted a petition to the municipal government, which was received by Zhang Zhuofang, the director of the fourth section, who promised to investigate thoroughly. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, they went to the Social Welfare Bureau again to appeal for relief, where they were received by Chief Secretary Hu Shouqi, who inquired about the details of the fire. He then gave instructions on how to handle the aftermath and promised to submit the matter to the municipal government for relief.</p>

The pharmaceutical factory team showed its strength and exerted its power, while the movie stars were at a loss. The Star Perfumery Factory team's victory over Tongren was a hard-fought one. The Xuan family team lacked stamina, and they peaked early and then declined, falling short of success, which was a pity. Tongren took a 10-0 lead at the beginning, and also led by one point with a score of 31 to 30 in the first half. In the second half, Lu Dazhen was fouled out, and the overall situation deteriorated. The final result was 69 to 59. In Group B, Lingyou defeated Tongyi, 24 to 18.</p>

The news was broadcast yesterday at 7:05 p.m.</p>
<h3>Germany Under Decisive Battle Posture</h3>
<p>What exactly is Germany like at this critical juncture, facing a life-or-death situation? During the First World War, although the front lines were strong, defeat was caused by the division in the rear. The German Jewish financial tycoons who manipulated the state apparatus earned war profits and then stabbed the German people in the back with seven daggers. This time, before launching the war, Germany completely eliminated dissidents at home, so the crisis of division that the enemy had longed for all along failed to materialize even once. The government constantly promotes the idea that "the rear should not hinder the front," so the people are all willing to abide by the law. Like Japan, under the whole sky, there are families whose fathers, brothers, or sons have died in battle. Wives and daughters, with one hand grasping the terrible news of the death of their loved ones and the other hand wiping away tears, go to the factories. The old men working in the offices feel no less than the soldiers on the front lines. Everyone's heart only has one idea that they cannot lose again, and this idea is eliminating all difficulties and forming a strong pillar, supporting the morale of the rear. This is the power that enables 12 million foreign workers to work in a country without young men. At the same time, it is also the driving force for picking out corrupt elements from the spiral disc of national activities.</p>
<h3>Enemy Propaganda Fails</h3>
<p>At first, the enemy's propaganda offensive invariably focused on sowing discord between the Party and the people and between the Party and the army, but since last year, they have abandoned this propaganda policy and started to tell the truth by threatening to crush the Nazi Party and the entire people regardless of any differences. This is due to encountering the barrier of the German people's will to fight. We have always thought that Germany's fate will definitely be determined by foreign battles, but this has not been the case. Even if Eisenhower uses leaflets or radio to instruct the attitude of the residents of the Rhine and Ruhr areas, even with threats and inducements, it doesn't seem to work. In the final analysis, it is still necessary to directly attack Berlin with force. The enemy who decided this is planning to slowly approach. As a result of the Second Quebec Conference and the intentions of the Soviet Union, the principles for resolving the German issue may be announced soon, but in any case, the hostility and resistance shown by the residents of the Rhine area make the enemy feel more and more intense as they go deeper. The resilience created by five years of war training and bombing is gradually showing itself outwardly, but the emotions of "cannot lose" and "cannot die" are stronger than the emotions of "must win." The German people have this kind of emotion in their determination to carry out a scorched earth tactic.</p>
<h3>Domestic Front Unified</h3>
<p>The assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20 has been cleared of a small number of rebels, and the domestic front is unified. The fighting spirit of the soldiers at the front has never waned. The belief in Hitler remains unwavering. Even from the recent fact that the garrisons of Cherbourg, Saint-Malo, and Brest insisted on fighting until the last bullet, sending telegrams of respect to Hitler, it can be seen that the soldiers support Hitler. In particular, the White Tiger team, composed of 17-year-old boys, established immortal feats on the Normandy front, and this time, on the German-Dutch border, they bravely fought with the enemy's airborne troops.</p>
<h3>Psychology of Shared Hatred Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>Looking at the National Guard Corps mobilized with all their strength, in terms of the psychology of shared hatred against the enemy, there have been great changes in the past year. When the war was launched, the German people were unwilling to consider the English and Americans as enemies because they had close ties in culture, politics, and economics. The opposite was true for the Soviet Union. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has always adopted a policy of isolation, not interacting with the outside world. On the other hand, the Nazi Party's anti-communist ideology and anti-communist policies instilled anti-Soviet ideas in the German people, such as "[Russia is an oriental beast]" and "[Siberia is a living hell]". Therefore, in the hearts of the people, the wildfire of the idea that "[the Soviet Union is a public enemy of the people]" is burning fiercely. Therefore, the Soviet army's victorious advance has generated a kind of power from the extreme hatred psychology of Germany, vowing to block the Soviet Red Army to the death. But Germany's feelings towards Britain and the United States have also become worse recently. This is due to the inhumane air raids by Britain and the United States. If the air raids target factories, this is understandable because they are military facilities, but the air raids have become more and more intense, and they have targeted civilian houses, hospitals, schools, monuments, and cultural institutions. Even recently, they have used machine guns to strafe churches and farmers cultivating in the fields. Therefore, the German people are furious at this inhumane behavior. The enemy thought that air raids could destroy the German people's will to fight, but the opposite is true. Instead, they have created an unprecedented anti-British and American sentiment among the German people. Today, the German people not only hate the Bolsheviks of the East, but also want to tear the flesh and eat the skin of the democratic countries of the West, Britain and the United States. Of course, those who hinder Hitler's dream of a Greater Third Reich are the enemies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. This belief has gradually become the belief of every German through painful reality. Therefore, the young Germans are more and more indignant in order to restore the unparalleled Greater Third Reich. Rosenberg recently said: [Young people understand German history and tradition through the world view of National Socialism, and at the same time, they realize that they are fighting for the happiness of the next generation of German people. Their fighting spirit is the fateful fighting spirit that understands the need to preserve history, tradition, and land, and remains unwavering.] We also often encounter their superhumanly strong beliefs, which amaze people. The whole of Germany is now standing on the last line of defense that cannot be retreated from. This war is a tragedy that no German people ever wanted. Perhaps the result will be the same as in the First World War, but in terms of the clear-mindedness of the German people, it is absolutely different from the First World War. The German Third Reich refers to the Nazi revival of Germany. The Nazis referred to the Holy Roman Empire built by Emperor Otto the Great in the tenth century as the First Reich, called the Germany of the Bismarck era later on as the Second Reich, and now they want to eliminate the shortcomings of the First and Second Reichs and build a purely German nation as the highest ideal. This is Hitler's Third Reich. (Translated by An from the September 27th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Yongnian Tai Chi Class Invites Director Peng for Lecture</h3>
<p>The Yongnian Tai Chi class organized by this office has had more than 100 young people from all walks of life participating in practice since its opening. At 7:00 a.m. the previous morning, they gathered at the empty space of the Chinese Education Morality Society on Nantong Road and invited Peng Shou, Director of the Central National Arts Center, to give a lecture. He briefly stated that in the past, China placed too much emphasis on literature and neglected martial arts, which resulted in unhealthy physiques and a weakening national strength. Now, this kind of corrupt idea should be broken as soon as possible. Martial artists must study literature, and literary people should also practice martial arts. The combination of literary and martial arts can make them healthy citizens. This newspaper's promotion of national martial arts is of profound significance, and it is especially admirable that it is free of charge to popularize it. I hope that everyone will uphold the spirit of the Three Educations and move forward bravely, in order to make the country strong and the people rich, and not disappoint the efforts of this newspaper. I am fortunate. In addition, Mr. Wei Yanfang was invited to give a lecture. He briefly said that I am a layman to Tai Chi, but I deeply know the mystery of Tai Chi, which is truly unbelievable. Many friends had weak constitutions, yellow skin and thin faces, but after practicing Tai Chi, they all changed from weak to strong, which shows that the effect of Tai Chi cannot be ignored. It is especially rare that Mr. Chuan Zhongwen is serving as a volunteer professor this time. I hope that you will follow Mr. Chuan's careful practice, so as not to disappoint the enthusiastic promotion of the Shen Bao, the Chinese Education Morality Society, and Mr. Chuan. ○ English Pronunciation Class: Started on October 15, using the phonetics training professor James of London University's record training, graduated in four weeks, class every Thursday afternoon, tuition 400 yuan.

<h3>Recent Youths (5)</h3>
<p>The spring of 1942 came running in like a shower. At the end of March, the cherry blossoms in the courtyard of the Ministry of the Navy were in full bloom. One morning, Longfu felt very refreshed. As he walked through the flower business, he suddenly saw Lieutenant Colonel Feitian. [Hey, the joint naval burial date for the martyrs has been decided. The memorial service will be held on April 8 at Hibiya Park. The funeral director is the Minister of the Navy. This is an unprecedented grand event since Lieutenant Colonel Guangbin.] Lieutenant Colonel Feitian regarded it as his own business, and his face was beaming with joy. [Oh, that's really glorious!] Longfu's face was also as bright and cheerful as the cherry blossoms in full bloom. [Since you are a close friend of Major Gu, you can shamelessly list yourself in the family seat of Major Gu.] [Yes, thank you!] Longfu agreed in writing. (It's really a grand event to hold a naval burial in Hibiya!) Longfu's heart was jumping as he thought of the solemnity of the ceremony. It is truly a great honor for a real person to receive such a price. At the same time, I also thought of the real person's promotion by two ranks. At the same time, the real person's apple face appeared on Longfu's heart plate, waving his hand and saying: [Oh, this is really torturing me, I really can't afford it.] (Yes, real people don't like others to flatter him.) However, I really hope that these bright cherry blossoms will continue to bloom until the day of the naval burial. The cherry blossom, which is both the national flower of Japan and the naval flower, should continue to bloom to commemorate the nine martyrs. But on April 1, the flowers began to fall like snow. Longfu was very sad. Looking at the scattered flowers on the ground, when he thought of the words [scattered cherry blossoms] in the eulogy of the martyrs, he felt that his request was useless. On April 8, tender buds had already grown on the tips of the cherry trees, and the remaining flowers remained on the trees like white butterflies. On this morning, Longfu washed his body with cold water and put on the formal dress sent by his father. When the landlady opened the door when he put on the memorial meeting badge on his left arm, she said: [Muta Koujun, there are guests.] [Huh? It's you?] Longfu shouted loudly. His sister's face appeared in the corridor. She was standing there wearing a spring coat and carrying a briefcase. (152)</p>
<h3>Donating to the Old People's Home is a Human Obligation</h3>
<p>Goal: 5,000,000 yuan Period: October 10th to November 10th Collection Place: Social Service Department of this newspaper Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday The nuns of the Shanghai Old People's Home, who are dedicated to serving the elderly, were deeply saddened when they talked about the issue of food and clothing. They said that although the current diet has reached the point of mixing miscellaneous grains, they can barely make ends meet, and they are worried that it will not be as bad as it is now. However, if prices continue to rise without end, and there is no source of daily expenses, at that time, they will inevitably be unable to continue to eat, and the pots and pans will be empty frequently, then hundreds of declining old people will not end up in the gutters, which is truly worrying. Confucius said: [Let the old be at peace, the friends be trusted, and the young be cherished.] Therefore, taking care of the old and cherishing the young are both obligations that human beings should fulfill, and we should give them deep sympathy. We respectfully ask people from all walks of life to have great compassion, provide convenience, donate generously, and contribute enthusiastically.
