<p>社評</p>
<h3>不要茍安</h3>
<p>近來社會上普遍流行着一種苟安的心理，處此嚴重的時局之下，這種心理實在是要不得的。</p>
<p>苟安的第一個結果是退縮，不求上進。第二個結果是自私，但是顧自己，不顧大衆。第三個結果是享樂，但圖目前，不計將來。苟安的心理表現在行為上，便是「得過且過」「各人自掃門前雪」一今朝有酒今朝醉」，這種行為使一個人墮落，使一個國家民族不能够復興，在戰爭時期，更是一件莫大危險的事。</p>
<p>在人生奮鬥的大道上，不上進就是後退，後退就是失敗。在敵我鬥爭的塲合中，我的後退，可以促成敵人前進的機會。有時，一些些的後退，可以使你永久不得前進，使你失敗得永久不得翻身。現在是世界整個轉變時期，中國國民是中國圈子內的一份子，中國國家又是大東亞圈內的一份子，任何國民都要「戰戰兢兢，如臨深淵，如履薄冰，」一步一步，謹愼小心，向前進行。這時候不容你靜止，不容你安閒，更不能些微疏忽。所謂「一失足成千古恨，再回頭已百年身。」眞是危急存亡之秋，那裏可以退縮，那裹可以「得過且過」</p>
<p>現在戰爭是全體性戰爭，在全體性戰爭裹，沒有前方後方的區別，沒有軍人平民的區別。任何地方，任何人都要受到戰爭的影饗，就是要想避免，也是沒有法子的。只有大家奮起，努力奮鬥，使勝利早日獲得，方才能得安定。這時候，國家的命運握在國民手裏，國民的命運更和國家的命運聯系着，國家有命，你也有命，國家沒命，你休想偷生。假使大家自私，不巷國家出力，結果是「皮之不存，毛將焉附？」現在正是大東亞戰爭決戰的重要時期，大家共同協力，努力邁進的時候，若要保全自己，先得保衛祖國，若要保衛祖國，先得保衛大東亞。那裹可以自私，那裹可以「各人自掃門前雪」。</p>
<p>享樂是每個人所希冀的，亦是每個人所需要的，可是，最要緊的，切不可以目前的享樂，換得將來的吃苦。在此時此地的環境，目前的享樂是否使將來吃苦，這個問題，用不到說明，只要想一想，假使某一國的人民，個個都求享樂，只圖目前，不計將來，那末國家的勝敗存亡，已不必取決於疆塲之上。假使中國國民是這樣的，那末我們更不必談解放，談自由了，這豈是我們所願意的。我們不願亡國，可是因為我們享樂的結果，使國家走上亡國之路，眞是好危險啊！范文正公說過：「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂。」退是我們中國的國民精神，這是我們中華民族維繫永存的唯一原因·現在豈是享樂的時候，更那裹可以「今日有酒今日醉」呢！</p>
<p>我們今天提出苟安心理問題，並說明他的害處，希望大家「有則改之，無則加勉」。這雖是個人問題，可是影響及於整個，所以每個人都要刻刻留心，自勉勉人</p>
<h3>琴丘嶺高地一帶雙方正展開砲戰印度國民軍協力圍殲敵軍</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電緬甸日軍前綫茶地訊：日軍精銳部隊與包　頓札恩之某部隊互相呼應，一齊進攻英印軍第十七師根據地梯迭姆前錢陣地之格納特匹克，各精銳部隊自敵軍正面開始砲擊，加以鎭壓，復向各路迂迥進攻，敵方已有敗退遁走之勢。敵第十七師約一萬之衆，鑒於前衛危殆，後路復斷，於是乃擬突破日軍佔領地域，遁入印度，而一齊擁至特伊達姆，與該地之日軍佔領部隊展開激戰，敵眾屍積如山，敵軍殲滅之期已迫眉睫。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央赴電據緬甸前綫日軍某基地電，日軍突破印緬國境密林地帶，勢如破竹，向前挺進，敵第八十一師主力數千，已陷於支　破裂狀態，爭先逃逸。被日軍某某各部隊，於加頓河比河各處切斷後路之敵軍，亦正徬徨無路，又日軍主力某部隊，十四日以來，陸續擊滅被　絕糧之殘敵，刻正由比河　地北上，向敵要衝某某急進中。</p>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電　日軍精銳部隊與印度國民軍緊急協力，對頓札恩梯迭姆之敵第十七師團主力，實行圍殲作戰，印度國民軍，對敵軍之頑抗，與日軍隨處實行接近攻擊，到處展開激鬥切斷梯迭姆，萊龍之敵軍退路，使其混亂。十五日晨以來，英軍已不顧印兵，企圖各乘車脫逃，同時福特瓦脫前方格納特匹克，及地姆爾之要塞守備隊，亦因日軍重砲隊之猛攻，不支漸向梯迭姆方面後退。日軍砲兵隊猛繫敗敵退路，目下琴丘嶺高地一帶，雙方展開砲戰，砲聲隆隆，震動山崗。</p>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電敵機鬥機二架，十五日下午來襲緬甸沿岸塔茵加甫（日溪南方），經日眾擊落一架，日方則無損失。</p>
<h3>緬日陸軍部隊再發動攻勢在全戰綫上發揮威力</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電緬甸日陸軍部隊，十六日在南部緬印國境辛澤瓦盆地，已將英軍第七師殲滅，而摧破蒙特巴頓反攻緬甸之企圖，此次殲滅戰完畢後，日軍即轉對阿拉坎山脈東方加拉頓河谷之西非軍及中部緬印國境琴丘陵地帶之英印軍，再度首先發動攻勢，與印度國民軍密切協力節節進攻。同時，北部緬甸國境富貢方面，日陸軍精銳各部威力，巳深入敵之內部。按緬甸美英渝三國聯軍，依據魁貝克會談决定之基本方針，企圖奪回緬甸，打通中緬公路，自表面觀，彼此之戰爭目的雖相一致，但實際三方之利害與反攻之用意，則完全不同。且其指揮系統不一，蒙特巴頓僅東南亞細亞軍總司令官，徒有虛名，即對所屬之英印軍固與歐慶萊克意見不一致，難以統率，對於駐印度渝軍及滇省渝軍更無絲毫之發令權，又駐印度渝軍係歸美將官史蒂威爾指揮，滇省渝軍則由總司令官衛立煌指揮，極盼美渝之反攻緬甸作戰，因軍令系統分歧，故當日軍實行猛攻後，即行紛紛潰退，此乃屬當然之勢。敵陣營既有此種根本缺陷，美英渝三軍指揮官之感情關係，亦極缺融和。駐重慶史蒂威爾司令部於十五日發表稱：蒙特巴頓與史蒂威爾最近會見時，曾協議史蒂威爾正式就任反軸心軍總司令官問題，同時協議此後對日作戰方針，此種事實尤為對方之感情將瀕破裂，而亟謀修好之象徵。蒙特巴頓因南部緬印國境之英第七師及第五師遭日軍猛攻，其形勢已吿不穩，仍行命令加拉頓河谷之西非軍第八十一師及中部緬印國境琴丘陵地帶之英軍旅團進擊，期挽回南部緬印國境之頹勢。但日軍早已窺破蒙特巴頓之新謀略，當敵軍尙未集合戰力前，即首先攻擊加拉頓河谷及琴丘陵地帶之敵軍，如是英美渝三軍之聯合反攻緬甸計劃已先後失敗，敵軍難於再行蠢動。當日軍此次在中部印緬國境初發動攻勢之極，緬甸方面日陸軍當局會於三月十日發表極具勝利把握之談話，此項談話完全與此次日軍之作戰實情相符合。</p>
<h3>大東亞留日本　在東京考試</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　大東亞共榮圈各地留日學生之入學考試，於日又部·大東亞·陸·海軍四省協議結果，决定由官立高等小學校辦理入學老試事宜。第一次考試自十六日上午九時起，在東京一高舉行三日，收容留學生之學校，有東京工大附屬預科·高工·高農·美術及音樂等全國計六十二校，應試者計中國學生二百七十八各，滿洲二百○二名，南方一百十名共計五百九十名。一般私費及特別留學生等，已於十六日舉行筆試，定十七·八兩日檢查身體。南方特別留學生中，有五十六名為初訊，計熊本醫科大學入名，宮崎高農十各，留米高工十八名，高島高師二十名，所學科目可大別為敎育，理工科及醫科，此均敎育彼等負建設共榮圈之使命。又此等南方留學生計緬甸十三名，爪哇二十一名，馬來·蘇門答臘十三名，菲律賓五名，洛勒爾大總統男公子馬利亞諾及菲律賓駐日大使伐爾加斯氏男公子耶德阿爾德亦在內。</p>
<h3>留日士官學生　决錄取十四名</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電考送留日士官學校學生者試事宜，業巳義事，全部成續，前曾發表。更為縝密甄選起見，經呈送考試委員作最後核定，日語成績及體格檢騐不合格者，均遭淘汰。決定錄取十四名，備取十名。</p>
<h3>砂鐵製鋼　日人研究成功</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電據室蘭來電稱：日本佐佐木製鋼股份公司，三年前在北海道設立研究所，以砂鐵為原料，研究製鋼法，三年來投資數十萬元，終於大功吿成。該掣鋼法稱為恥爾型直倍製鋼法，以電氣熔鋼將砂鐵鏈成純鋼，其品質極為優良。從此源源利甩，北海道噴火環一帶，無盡藏之砂鐵，製造純鋼，當對增強戰力有莫大貢獻。</p>
<h3>印國民會議派　與總督府對立</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電印度國民會議派，前因耍求釋放政治犯問題，與英印總督府開始鬥爭後，刻雙方仍成對立形勢。該會議派領袖安茲兩魏勒，十五日於中央議會席上，復提出「防止濫用國防法案，」與總督府及內務委員會代表激辯歷二小時之久，當時情况極為緊張，實為近年所罕見，該案投票結果，以五十三對四十四央定延期繼續討議。</p>
<h3>日駐華派遣軍發表一週戰况陸軍機隊獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電日駐華派遺軍報道部，於十七日發表週間戰况。三月十一日十四日兩日晚間，日陸軍機歐曾反復對五處敵軍重要據點，加以轟炸，收獲莫大戰果。十一日空襲桂林，擊毀其軍事設施，及停於陸上之大型飛機十一架，使其起火·十四日空襲衡　·遂川·桂林。肇慶。梧州·各地，擊毀其停放地上之大型飛機等六架，，及附屬軍事設施，滑走路，予敵軍莫大損害，全隊無事歸還。又繼續作肅淸討伐戰之陸上部隊，十一日掃蕩黃家潭（鄂省監利西方，）東方地區活躍之新四軍，殲滅其大半。</p>
<p>蕪開淸鄕會議</p>
<p>蕪湖十七日中央社電淸鄉事務局十六日上午十時，召開淸鄉會議。對淸鄉區武力之配備，檢問所之設置，封鎖錢之劃別，碉堡之建築等工作，均獲具體之决定。</p>
<h3>日國民運動具體方針聯絡部委員集議討論</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電日本國民總崛起運動聯絡本部委員人選問題，十七日正式决定，計政府方面有安藤內相等五人，翼贊會　面有後藤副總裁等十四人，翼政會方面有前田總務部長等十四人·共計委員三十三人。並定於十八日下午三時於首相官邸召開首屆大會，討論今後國民運動之具體方針，以期活潑展開工作。</p>

<h3>義南卡西諾爭奪戰熾烈美第五軍攻勢又受挫</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據德軍當局發表：敵軍於施行猛烈之空襲後，復以紐西蘭軍及法軍來犯卡西諾，並以强大之砲隊及坦克車隊助戰，敵軍一股曾一度侵人市內，但即刻被英函之　傘兵擊退，激戰刻乃在進行中。義境其餘諸戰區中並無大戰。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：十五日義前綫最重要之事件，為美第五軍在卡西諾區復作大規模之淮攻。此次美軍已决定改變其戰術，強大之敵轟炸機編隊自侵晨起不斷襲擊卡西諾，力　擊破德防軍之抵抗，至中午美軍以重榴彈砲火代替空襲，然後以强大之步兵與坦克軍隊開始進攻。但克拉克將軍又大失算，致蒙受重大損失而被擊退。雖有若千敵坦克車竄人市鎭，但美軍損失過大，不得不中止進攻。十六日清晨敵冉度續行空襲，預料下午仍將以步兵與坦克車進攻。</p>

<h3>布格河西岸激戰進行中舊波境蘇發動新攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電德國新開社訊；大規模激戰，繼續在克森。泰諾波爾間地區進行，烏克國境布格河以東各點，亦展開酣戰。蘇軍再　遷移其軍事重心至烏曼西南地區，蘇軍在該處若干點渡過布格河，企圖圍殲該處大批德軍部隊，但其期望為德軍頑强防禦所粉碎。蘇軍之第二新重心，在魯資克南方地區，該處敵眾已有數日毫無動作，今則以步兵敎師團與坦克車一隊發動進攻，意圖不惜任何代價，向西衝入德軍之戰綫，但遭遇德防軍兇猛砲火，雖得突破若千較小裂口，不久大部均被堵合。北部紅軍在尼維爾斯科夫公路之北，以坦克車與主力機為掩護，企圖突破德軍陣地，但無結果。</p>

<h3>英美機襲德　損失重大</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電德國新聞社訊。德官方發表，美機在大隊戰鬥機保護下，於日昨中午侵入德南部，當時黑雲蔽天，敵機於於多處　彈，特別着重奧格斯堡及烏爾姆，大時難不利，但德之防空部隊仍能擊落敵機三十六架，其中包括四引擎轟炸機二十二三架。又英機數架會於昨晚襲德之西部。</p>
<p>林十六日中央社電，英機昨晚侵入德西南部，而襲斯社特加特城及其四郊，被擊落六六十架</p>
<p>一致口碑載道地在盛傳着，吉田松陰先生是國士的模範。這一點，對於六十餘年來到處鼓吹贊頌松陰先生的筆者來說，實在是驚喜萬分。那末，吉田松陰先生究竟作過什麼事？大概沒有像松陰先生那樣，能深知平時與戰時之區別者，松陰先生以當時為非常時期。池認為在非常時期作非常事件，不僅無妨而且應該。先生根據這一點所作的事情，如呌專埋頭於等因奉此之類繁文褥禮者流君來，就被認為是狂人狂事。未得藩王命令而旅行，這是違犯藩王快律的，但先生與熊本藩士宮部鼎蔽等約好遊學凍北，而恐怕爽約，於是不待批准而竟自由落王府出發。當時出遊外國　是國法所不容的‘假如是為了國家辦公事，是不要緊的，於是乘上伯爾利旗艦。孔子說過，君子思不出其位。然而先生以隸屬於社局於家的士大夫名義，或上書藩主，或寄書與京師的大臣，思供天子閱讀。在所謂俗吏看來，凡先生所作者，全是越軌行動。</p>
<p>然而從今天看來，孰是孰非，早已洞若覜火。非當時期，就需要非常事悄。非常時期作非常事情，就是正當意義上的常道。所以今天並不是逍遙自在，悠悠自得的時侯了。不耍藉口說，你老朽，你無用，你能力太小，而阻止他人服務，是耍相互合作服務的。或者自已藉口，老关　矣，無能為矣，或者藉口，自己不學無術。精力不足，而自己則高蹈亨樂，而讓他人服務。還是不對的。不能者，無辦法，凡能者，皆宜相互協助工作。在社會中，也有特別想服務，而不得工作者。這是絕對的大錯。在這種社會中說無工作者，實在可以受罰。假</p>
<h3>閑話時局</h3>
<p>如說沒有，那末路傍的馬糞也可以拾啊！秋收後的田地裹，也可以拾取落穗啊！</p>
<p>此時凡者慮地位或顏面而躊躇不前者，已經非其時了。太太作娘、姨的事情，有什麼丟臉呢？老爺看看鬥又有何妨！　然有僕人是有僕人的必要，然而如無僕人就行不通麼？想喝茶成水，就自酌自飲。假如所有的人都深深地記住這是非常時期。那末日本國走會作出超過今日數十倍的工作來。我認為一萬萬人至少能作出兩萬萬人以上的工作來。當然這决不是說，甚至讓手足不靈的隆鍾老人，以及懷抱的嬰兒也作工的意思。凡能昨工者，如果都能拼命作工，就一定會衆志成城，集　成姦。</p>
<p>在社會上有入小時勞動制。在民主國家，甚至認八小時勞動　過份，而逐漸減少努動時間，或改為七小時，或改為六小時，甚至有人主張以五小時為最高限度。然而這些話也已經陳腐了，是承平時代的話，而在今天，則事過境遷了。固然，人類是動物，霧要相　休養，這無論在什麽時候，甚至在非常時期，都必須考慮到的。然而過去自由主義經濟論者所說的勞動時間限度等，無非是與題目不同的節制生育等自由主義盛行時期的妄想。初無二致的。假如一切工作者毫不怠工，以愛護國家的至誠，齊心努力服務，則比今日更大的效果，可立而待焉。我决不是說，今日的工作者怠工，或不努力。而是說，非常時期　有非常時期的覺悟，這决不限於工作者，任何人都應當如此。這就是說，在此不僅提倡年齡獻公論，而且休養奉公論也是必要的。假如」萬萬國民都延長勞動一小時，則會多出一萬萬小時來。其中當然也有勞動已達極限者，還有小孩，老人及病者應當扣　的一部份，但無論如何　，假如每一價人都有决心延長工作一小時，則一定會取得驚人的效果。</p>
<p>我在此所講的，卽政府當局為使年齡　公者各得其所，為休養奉公者開關有效使用其時間的道路，宜採取充分有組織的，有計劃的事務的措置。井然有序的勞動比漆黑一團糟的勞動，是事半功倍的。所以勞動力的配合，是必經恰到好處的。按個別的機能，能達到各盡所能，這就是最能發揮效率的不二法鬥。有土工經騐者則命其作土工，有計算技能者則命其担任會計，這樣是最要緊的。命戲劇演員摔跤。令摔跤　扮演舞台角色，這樣，縱令工作者筋疲力竭，也不會有好的收獲、我想這是無經費辭解　的，尤其對於今日的徵發，如不特別考核應徵者的素質和經歷，加以最有效地利用，則其結果，實等於倒煤油於大海，使有用者變為無用。（未完）魯譯自二月九日每日新聞</p>

<h3>英美利用渝物資企圖逞其野心松島部長昨發表談話</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部部長松島大佐，昨（十七日）循例招待中國記者團，發表談話如次：大佐首謂近來在太平洋方面·美海軍因無進展，甚感焦灼，迺圖以政治手腕，解决其困難，並企圖利用中國之土地·人力·物資，與渝合作，再對日作最後决戰。關於利用中國土地與人力之點，美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資，已迭言之綦祥，無待　述，吾人現僅就其利用物資一點，加以檢討。</p>
<p>昆明物價滕貴原因</p>
<p>大佐申引三月十六日路透社　電稱：「外交部長」宋子文「財政部長」孔祥熙，近至昆明作短期旅行，孔在昆明對記者發表談話謂，將在昆明調查物價騰貴原因，並研究對策。根據此項消息，證明目前昆明民衆之生活已極感困難。松島部長又提出去年九月間調查所得，昆明與上海兩地之物價對照表，以資佐證：</p>
<p>昆明　上海白米　一市石　二·四六四·○○元　一·八○○·○○元小麥粉　一袋　九六八·○○元　四九○·○○元猪肉　一市斤　六○·○○元　四五·六四元食油　一市斤　八二·○○元　四一·六三元鹽　一市斤　三○·○○元　三·九五元砂糖　一市斤　二○·○○元　三三·○○元</p>
<p>大佐解釋，昆明物價之高漲原因，實為大批英美人進駐昆明附近所致，英美人雖來中國，但其豪華生活，一仍舊貫，不稍撙節，重慶如此，在桂林亦如此，同時昆明為英美輸送機之終點，以輸送機帶走中國大批物資，亦為助長物價高漲之一因。</p>
<p>日本目的在求和平</p>
<p>松島大佐嗣鄭軍指出謂：目前進駐渝方之英美人僅為少數，茍一旦尼米資之利用中國大陸作戰之計劃實現，大批英美軍開入，斯時發生兩項結果：　民　生活更為困苦，　中國土地竟成戰塲，人力徒為英美犧牲，物產減少　缺乏，終至人民不能生存，遭受空前慘禍。固然，今日日本軍民亦進駐中國，受中國一部份物資供給，但日本目的在求和平，英美之金圖則恰相反，圖化中國為戰場，井奪取中國物交，殘殺中國人—，而達到其征服東亞之野心，陰　之毒辣·為亘古所未有。大佐復再　重指稱：日本海軍在太平洋作戰，其成敗　　中國之未　命運空鉅。日海軍　利，中國和平可保、反之巾國大陸將為英美所蹂躪·目前中國參加大東亞戰爭，僅為協力物　·中國人民若能以一元錢之物資協力參戰，即可避免將來土地生命財產數萬萬元之損失。</p>

<h3>求人不如求己</h3>
<p>求人不如求己，是呌人振作自己，是呌人不存依賴之心，因為求人　可抱着一個渺茫的希望，而求己則至少具有相當的把握，在今日食米不敷配給的環境下·非但米糧商人，甚至米糧統　當局，恐怕都　抱住以前糧食政策中最不健全的一種思想，就是終日經營於洋米之如何輸八，以為洋米是可以有恃而無恐的。如今，因為戰時這區因難，洋米的輸入自然亳無把舉，即使展轉運到，亦覺「遠水不救近火」。所以，今日要有仰仗洋米來接濟國內食糧的話，那是太不澈底了。</p>
<p>求人不如求己，與其仰給於洋米的接濟，不如努力於國米的增產，在今日嚴重的食糧問題中，第一，要能確保國內貧糧之需給；第二，要使食米脫出商品的範國，因此，我們始終同情於去年十月十一日大陸新報所說的幾句話：「决定米穀收買價格，限制商人利潤，排除農民不願脫售的傾向，這都是今日食糧問題的最適當政策」。</p>

<h3>鐵道交通的改善</h3>
<p>— （馬家璋）</p>
<p>鐵道交通的改善，可分成乘客，和運輸二方而來說。</p>
<p>就乘客而論，第一個要改善的應是旅客過分擁擠的問題。只要這問題能解决，旅客們至少可減去一大半行旅的苦痛。從現狀中，已經很明白地吿訴我們，旅客擁擠必不是眞正繁榮的現象，完全由走單帮的人太冬的原故造成的。當然改善乘車旅客過分擁擠現象的最好方法，就是肅淸單帮客人。這責任應求三方面能同時負起。第一是統制當局能強化統制，第二是鐵道當局能使物資運輸完全流暢，第三是希望旅客們能自己痛切覺悟。</p>
<p>改善售票方法，也可減少旅客擁擠的程度。售栗處可全部設在站外，終日地工作着。這樣旣可給旅客們一個長時期的購票時間，而消滅了旅客購票時擁擠的情形，並且　黑市票　及一切售票的弊　，都可自然地免除。售票處還可根據統計一般旅客至各地的歡目，再配合火車所能載客的最大能力，這樣我們便能很容易地計算出每日旅客至各地的平均最大數額。依着道數額，售票處便能决定每日至各地售果的多寡，而加以限制旅客，使購不着車票的旅客，不在空跑到車站內去擠軋。因此也可減少軍站和車箱內擠軋的情景了。售票處還可第一天預售第二天的車票，並冉縮短車票的有用性只有一天、這樣或者能够避免許多不肖者的操縱。</p>
<p>現今的火車票價，因爲頭等·二等·與三等的比率太高的緣故；一般旅客都望而却步、無力乘坐頭等·二等者居多。因此火車頭等·二等客車的座位，浪費太多。這種浪費在平日不過只是鐵道當局的損失而已，但在今日車輛正感不嗷應用、旅客十分擁擠的時候，這種無謂的浪費，未免太不應該，不合乎情理了。所以我們希鐵道當局，能完全免除了頭等車的各義，就是二等軍的座位，也應當減至最少數。</p>
<p>車决的排列，我們希望能更精密一點。使得調車的時間盡力減少，車行時間務必準確。這樣不但可減少旅客在車箱中擠軋的痛苦，且也能增加客車的效能。此外軋票時間也可盡量提早。對於鐵道從業員應訓練他們規律·嚴正。處處都能給旅客以指導和協助。</p>
<p>旅客不守秩序，常常會使自己痛苦增加。不守秩序，好像是我國人的劣根性。但我們不能就此不改善。所以希望每個旅客都能顧到大家的利益，例如檢查購票，軋票，上車，下車時，都可依着　序，不一定就要死命的濟軋。尤其是在途中上下車時，道通東輛都有兩個車門，我們正可利用它們一個專用着下車，一個專用着上車、旣可避免秩序混亂擠軋，同時旅客們又省時省力。</p>
<p>就運輸而論，使得物資運輸圓滑，流暢，在論理上最理想的辦法，就是增加車輛。不過在今日戰爭狀熊中，軍事第一的條件下，這常常是不能實現的。但如果我們能將物資運輸的機構，管理，計劃、手段，都能健全起來，雖然是最少數的車輛·我們也能使它們發揮最大的能力，表現最大的效果。今略言如下：</p>
<p>運輸列車效能的研究一般人常以爲車輛的載重能力，若能儘量利用，即使速度甚低，也能得到車輛的最大效用，這實在是似是而非的見解。因爲運輸列車效能的表現，既不是載重的大小，也不是速度的高低，而在兩者得到平衡，使能恰到好處。所以研究載重和速度的配合，仍是運輸最重要的事。因爲徒求車輛　重增大，未必即能獲得效能最大的利用。當然主要路綫較短。物資運輸較　之路，運輸列車常須沿途摘　軍輛，裝卸貨物，因此沿途載重不同，而停車時間父較長，所以很難講求載重和速度的配合。但在　綫較長，物資運輸較盛之路，定有多　整車貨物組成列車，行駛較長的里程，沿途不必停留，或者停留甚少者，鐵道當局對於此項車輛，應講求載重與通度的經濟，以期獲　車稱平均時的最大效用。</p>
<p>爲着實行上項建議，筆者以爲今日鐵道當局應研究下列各點。决定相當標準，而切實實行。</p>
<p>一·决定各種車輛在每段路綫內的最經濟速度，和載重噸數。</p>
<p>二·規定各種事輛在各段路綫內應有的　能標準，以便隨時與實在成績比較、</p>
<p>三·研究車輛的編組方法，滅少各段內停車時問。</p>
<p>四·對於各段內無須停留，或停留甚少的車輛，應將它們行駛時刻切實規定，並且切實遵守，竭力避免守候其他車輛時間的耗費。</p>
<p>利用間空車輛運輸車輛回空，這是鐵道在遝輸上常有的情形。但這種損失很大，尤其在現在軍輛本不敷用的時候，這現象更不能容以存在。所以鐵道管理者，對於空車的里程應力求減少。如遇回空車輛太多時，應在改進車輛調度方法之外，另謀根本補救辦法，那便是增加回空方向的運輸。</p>
<p>貨物運輸先後的决定　運輸在今日雖然無論想什麼改善力法，但車輛不足　是事實。所以事輛運輸貨物的力量便是有限的了。利用運有限的力量運輪貨物時，當然對於各　貨物的性質，和需要，應加以細密的研究。應該誰者運輸在先，誰者運輸在後、當有一個决定。這决定的標準，在今日要看各貨物與民衆生活關係的程度了、</p>
<p>貨物裝卸工作應速貨物裝卸工作快速的結果，當然可以減少許多因延擱而產生的弊害·車輛的周轉因此也靈活，所以更間接增大了貨物車輛運輸的效能。</p>

        <h1>1944.03.18</h1>
<h3>Do Not Acquiesce</h3>
<p>Recently, a psychology of acquiescence has become prevalent in society. Given the severity of the current situation, this psychology is truly undesirable.</p>
<p>The first result of acquiescence is retreat and a lack of striving for progress. The second result is selfishness, caring only for oneself and disregarding the public. The third result is hedonism, focusing only on the present and neglecting the future. The manifestation of acquiescence in behavior is "getting by," "each sweeping only the snow from his own doorstep," and "a drunken spree today." Such behavior degrades an individual and prevents a nation from revitalizing. During wartime, it is an even greater danger.</p>
<p>On the road of life's struggles, not advancing is retreating, and retreating is failing. In the arena of struggle against the enemy, my retreat can create opportunities for the enemy to advance. Sometimes, a small retreat can prevent you from advancing permanently, causing a failure from which you can never recover. Now is a time of global transformation. The Chinese people are a part of the Chinese sphere, and the Chinese nation is a part of the Greater East Asia sphere. Every citizen must be "cautious and conscientious, as if facing a deep abyss or walking on thin ice," taking each step with careful deliberation and moving forward. This is not a time for stillness, leisure, or even the slightest negligence. As the saying goes, "One wrong step causes eternal regret; turning back, a hundred years have passed." This is truly a time of crisis and survival. How can there be retreat? How can one "get by"?</p>
<p>Now, war is a holistic war. In a holistic war, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, no distinction between soldiers and civilians. Everywhere and everyone is affected by the war, and there is no way to avoid it even if one wants to. Only by rising up and striving together to achieve victory as soon as possible can we attain stability. At this time, the destiny of the nation is in the hands of the people, and the destiny of the people is linked to the destiny of the nation. If the nation has life, you also have life. If the nation is lost, do not even think of surviving. If everyone is selfish and does not contribute to the nation, the result will be, "If the skin is gone, where can the hair attach?" Now is a crucial period for the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War. It is a time for everyone to work together and strive forward. If you want to preserve yourself, you must first defend the motherland. If you want to defend the motherland, you must first defend Greater East Asia. How can there be selfishness? How can one "sweep only the snow from his own doorstep"?</p>
<p>Enjoyment is what everyone desires and needs. However, the most important thing is to avoid trading future suffering for present enjoyment. In the current environment, whether present enjoyment will lead to future suffering is a question that needs no explanation. Just imagine if the people of a certain country all seek enjoyment, focusing only on the present and neglecting the future, then the victory or defeat and survival of that country would not depend on the battlefield. If the Chinese people were like this, then we would not even need to talk about liberation or freedom. This is certainly not what we desire. We do not want the nation to perish, but if our pursuit of enjoyment leads the nation down the path of destruction, it is truly dangerous! Fan Zhongyan once said, "Be the first to worry about the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures." This is our Chinese national spirit, and it is the sole reason for the enduring existence of our Chinese nation. Now is not a time for enjoyment. How can one "a drunken spree today"?</p>
<p>Today, we raise the issue of acquiescence and explain its harms in the hope that everyone will "correct their faults if they have them, and strive harder if they do not." Although this is a personal issue, it affects the whole. Therefore, everyone must be constantly mindful and encourage themselves and others.</p>
<h3>Heavy Artillery Battles Erupt Around the Qinqiu Ridge Highlands; Indian National Army Collaborates to Annihilate Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) From the Chadi front in Burma: Elite Japanese troops, in coordination with a unit under Bao Dunzhaen, are jointly attacking the Yingyin Army's 17th Division base at Genatepeak, the forward position of Tidiemu. The elite troops commenced a frontal artillery barrage to suppress the enemy and then launched flanking attacks on all routes. The enemy is already showing signs of defeat and retreat. The enemy's 17th Division, numbering about 10,000, realizing that their vanguard is in danger and their rear is cut off, planned to break through the Japanese-occupied territory and flee into India. They converged on Teidam, where they engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese occupation forces stationed there. Enemy corpses are piled high, and the annihilation of the enemy army is imminent.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Burmese front reports that Japanese forces have broken through the dense forests on the Indian-Burmese border with unstoppable momentum. The main force of the enemy's 81st Division, numbering several thousand, has been routed and is fleeing in disarray. The enemy forces, whose retreat was cut off by various Japanese units at the Gaton River and the Bichi River, are also aimlessly wandering. In addition, a main Japanese force has been continuously eliminating the starving remnants of the enemy since the 14th. They are currently moving north from the Bichi River area toward a key enemy point.</p>
<p>Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Elite Japanese troops and the Indian National Army are urgently collaborating to encircle and annihilate the main force of the enemy's 17th Division at Dunzhaen Tidiemu. The Indian National Army is engaging in close combat with the Japanese army everywhere, fiercely fighting against the enemy's stubborn resistance. They are cutting off the enemy's retreat routes from Tidiemu and Railong, causing confusion. Since the morning of the 15th, British troops have been abandoning Indian soldiers and attempting to escape by vehicle. Simultaneously, the garrisons of Fort Watt's forward Genatepeak and the Dimur fortress have been gradually retreating towards Tidiemu due to the heavy bombardment by Japanese artillery. The Japanese artillery is fiercely targeting the retreating enemy, and heavy artillery battles are currently raging around the Qinqiu Ridge highlands, the booming sound of cannons shaking the hills.</p>
<p>Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Two enemy fighter planes attacked Tainjiao Fu (south of Rixi) on the Burmese coast on the afternoon of the 15th. One was shot down by Japanese forces, while the Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Burmese-Japanese Army Units Launch Another Offensive, Unleashing Power on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the 16th, Japanese army units in Burma annihilated the British 7th Division in the Xinzewa Basin on the southern Burmese-Indian border, thwarting Mountbatten's attempt to counterattack Burma. After the completion of this annihilation operation, the Japanese army immediately launched another offensive against the West African forces in the Kalaton River valley east of the Arakan Mountains and the British-Indian forces in the Qinqiu Ridge area of the central Burmese-Indian border, closely collaborating with the Indian National Army to advance step by step. At the same time, in the Fugong area on the northern Burmese border, the elite units of the Japanese army have penetrated deep into the enemy's territory. According to the basic policy determined at the Quebec Conference, the combined forces of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing aim to retake Burma and open the Sino-Burmese Highway. Although their war aims appear to be the same on the surface, their actual interests and counterattack intentions are completely different. Moreover, their command systems are inconsistent. Mountbatten is merely the Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Command in name only. He has different opinions from Auchinleck regarding the British-Indian forces under his command, making it difficult to lead them. He has no authority to issue orders to the Chongqing troops stationed in India or the Yunnan troops. The Chongqing troops stationed in India are under the command of American General Stilwell, while the Yunnan troops are under the command of Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang. It is hoped that the US-Chongqing counterattack operation in Burma will be plagued by a divided military command system. Therefore, when the Japanese army launches a fierce attack, they will collapse and retreat. This is the natural course of events. The enemy camp has such fundamental defects, and the emotional relationships between the commanders of the US, Britain, and Chongqing are extremely lacking in harmony. The Stilwell Command in Chongqing announced on the 15th that Mountbatten and Stilwell had recently met to discuss the issue of Stilwell officially assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces, and also discussed the future war strategy against Japan. This fact is particularly symbolic of the other side's emotions nearing rupture and urgently seeking reconciliation. Mountbatten, because the British 7th and 5th Divisions on the southern Burmese-Indian border have suffered fierce attacks by the Japanese army and their situation has become unstable, still ordered the 81st West African Division in the Kalaton River valley and the British brigades in the Qinqiu Ridge area of the central Burmese-Indian border to attack, hoping to reverse the decline on the southern Burmese-Indian border. However, the Japanese army had already seen through Mountbatten's new strategy and attacked the enemy forces in the Kalaton River valley and the Qinqiu Ridge area before they could gather their strength. As such, the joint US-British-Chongqing counterattack plan in Burma has failed one after another, and the enemy forces will have difficulty launching another clumsy move. When the Japanese army first launched its offensive in the central Burmese-Indian border, the Burmese Japanese Army authorities made a statement on March 10 expressing their extremely confident grasp of victory. This statement is completely consistent with the actual situation of the current Japanese operation.</p>
<h3>Students from Greater East Asia to Study in Japan; Examinations Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The entrance examinations for students from various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to study in Japan have been decided to be handled by government-run higher elementary schools as a result of discussions between the Japanese Ministry of Education, Ministry of Greater East Asia, Ministry of the Army, and Ministry of the Navy. The first examination began at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th at Tokyo No. 1 High School and will last for three days. The schools that will accept the students include 62 schools nationwide, including the preparatory course attached to Tokyo Institute of Technology, high industrial schools, high agricultural schools, art schools, and music schools. There are a total of 590 examinees, including 278 Chinese students, 202 Manchurian students, and 110 students from the South. General private-funded and special students took written examinations on the 16th, and physical examinations are scheduled for the 17th and 18th. Among the special students from the South, 56 are beginners, including those admitted to Kumamoto Medical University, Miyazaki High Agricultural School, Ryukyu High Industrial School, and Takashima High Normal School. The subjects they will study can be broadly divided into education, science and engineering, and medicine. They are all being educated to bear the mission of building the Co-Prosperity Sphere. These students from the South include 13 from Burma, 21 from Java, 13 from Malaya and Sumatra, and 5 from the Philippines, including Mariano, the son of President Laurel, and Yedealde, the son of Philippine Ambassador to Japan Vargas.</p>
<h3>Decision to Admit Fourteen Military Academy Students to Study in Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The examination for sending military academy students to study in Japan has already been completed, and the overall results were previously announced. For a more thorough selection, the examination committee submitted the results for final review, and those who failed the Japanese language test or physical examination were eliminated. A decision has been made to admit fourteen students and ten alternates.</p>
<h3>Japanese Successfully Research and Develop Steelmaking from Iron Sand</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from Muroran, the Sasaki Steel Co., Ltd. in Japan established a research institute in Hokkaido three years ago to study steelmaking methods using iron sand as raw material. After investing tens of thousands of yuan over the past three years, they have finally succeeded. The steelmaking method is called the Hull-type direct double steelmaking method, which uses electric melting to refine pure steel from iron sand. Its quality is extremely high. From now on, the inexhaustible iron sand around the volcanic ring of Hokkaido can be used to manufacture pure steel, which will make a great contribution to enhancing combat power.</p>
<h3>Indian National Congress Party in Opposition to the Governor-General's Office</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Indian National Congress Party, which began its struggle with the British Indian Governor-General's Office over the issue of demanding the release of political prisoners, remains in opposition. The leader of the party, Anziliangweiler, again proposed the "Prevention of Abuse of the National Defense Act" in the Central Assembly on the 15th, engaging in a fierce debate with representatives of the Governor-General's Office and the Internal Affairs Committee for two hours. The situation was extremely tense and rarely seen in recent years. The result of the vote was 53 to 44, deciding to postpone further discussion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Weekly War Situation; Air Units Achieve Significant Results</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The press department of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the weekly war situation on the 17th. On the evenings of March 11th and 14th, Japanese army air units repeatedly bombed five important enemy strongholds, achieving significant results. On the 11th, an air raid on Guilin destroyed its military facilities and 11 large aircraft parked on the ground, causing them to catch fire. On the 14th, air raids on Hengyang, Suichuan, Guilin, Zhaoqing, and Wuzhou destroyed six large aircraft parked on the ground, as well as attached military facilities and runways, causing great damage to the enemy. All units returned safely. In addition, the ground troops continuing the mopping-up and suppression operations wiped out most of the New Fourth Army active in the Huangjiatan (west of Jianli, Hubei Province) and eastern regions on the 11th.</p>
<p>Wu Kai Qingxiang Conference</p>
<p>Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Qingxiang Affairs Bureau convened a Qingxiang conference at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th. Concrete decisions were made regarding the deployment of armed forces in the Qingxiang area, the establishment of inspection posts, the demarcation of blockade lines, and the construction of bunkers.</p>

<h3>Original Judgment in the Embezzlement Case of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng</h3>
<p>(Continued) Furthermore, on April 14th of the same year, Hou Dachun, acting on the orders of the Grain Department, and Hu Zheng cooperated to purchase glutinous rice in Wuxi and Changzhou at a price of no more than 300 yuan per picul. The funds were paid by the public glutinous rice company. Later, Hou Dachun wanted to handle the matter alone, so he sent his staff to investigate various places and issued instructions to the magistrates of Changzhou and Wuxi counties and the heads of various special work stations to cooperate. He actually sealed up all the glutinous rice owned by rice merchants in the city, totaling 26,440 piculs of glutinous rice, 1,028 piculs of brown rice, and 2,845 piculs of white rice in Wuxi, and 21,446 piculs of rough rice, 1,377 piculs of brown rice, and 214 piculs of white rice in Changzhou. Later, Hou Dachun wanted to forcibly purchase eight-tenths of the sealed rice and return two-tenths to the rice merchants. Because he conspired with Zheng Ziwen, the chairman of the Wuxi Joint Operations Cooperative, he transported 2,740 piculs and eight dou of white glutinous rice and 238 piculs and six dou of brown glutinous rice from Wuxi to Suzhou and sold it to the Mainland Rice Factory. After opposition from Wuxi rice merchants such as Zhao Zhangji, Hou Dachun reached an agreement with Zhou Naiwen, the vice minister of the Grain Department, to return one-third to the rice merchants and forcibly purchase two-thirds. Zhou Naiwen went to Suzhou on October 5th, and Hou Dachun again discussed the matter with him face-to-face, deciding to sell it locally at a price of 1,200 yuan per picul (at that time, the market price was 440 yuan per picul, plus a Grain Bureau adjustment fee of 400 yuan and a Grain Department adjustment fee of 360 yuan, as mentioned above). Zheng Ziwen introduced Xu Ruitang, the owner of the Wuxi Tongyu Grain Firm, and delivered 12,003 piculs and 36 catties of rough rice to the Wuxi Jiaotongyu Firm, and 140 piculs and 89 catties in Changzhou, and 5,250 piculs of brown rice in Xuzhou. After October 20th, he transported 1,250 piculs from rice wholesalers in Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places. The funds for the aforementioned compulsory purchase of glutinous rice, totaling 348,411 yuan and two jiao from the Grain Department, have not yet been cleared. Most of the proceeds from the sale, about 14 million yuan, were deposited in the bank in the name of the Grain Bureau. In addition to Hou Dachun embezzling 600,000 yuan (of which 100,000 yuan was transferred to others), the interest earned from the 7.5 million yuan deposited in the bank was divided and used with others. Also, from April to November of the same year, the Wujin County government, at the request of the Rong troops, purchased 43,000 piculs of rice husks. At that time, there was not enough rice stored in Changzhou City, so the county customs chief borrowed 3,359 piculs of rice from Hou Dachun (the rice money was used by Hou Dachun to misappropriate 500,000 yuan from the national treasury and the people's food rice money in Changzhou). At the end of August of the same year, the county magistrate returned Hou Darong the same amount, which was sold at the prevailing market price, illegally profiting 500,000 yuan. Also, in May of the same year, Hou Dachun ordered the Changshu Liquor Industry Guild to reorganize into the Chu Kun District Brewing Industry Guild and the Seasoning Industry Guild. On December 23rd, Hou Dachun restricted brewing methods, stating that brewing was not allowed without the permission of the Grain Bureau, and sent agents to various places to allow the brewing of 19,0328 piculs on the condition that 45 yuan per picul of glutinous rice used for brewing be extracted (in reality, there was no restriction on brewing). At the same time, he demanded a bribe of 700,000 yuan from the merchants. After the payment, Hou Dachun acquiesced to the free movement of glutinous rice in the Changshu area. Hu Zheng was the former director of the Su-Song-Chang-Jia District Rice Grain Purchasing and Sales Office of the Grain Department. During his tenure from April to October of the 32nd year, he discussed matters with the relevant authorities, and the joint operations cooperatives in various counties purchased rice at low prices and reported them at high prices, or reported them at high prices and replenished them at low prices, and inflated the joint lockup expenses and commissions of the joint operations cooperatives in various counties, continuously receiving about 30 million yuan. In addition to distributing it to the relevant authorities, he obtained 5.6 million yuan for himself. After the matter was discovered, the National Government issued an order for review.</p>
<p>Reasons Based on the above facts, the defendants Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng have repeatedly confessed without reservation, and they are consistent with the evidence submitted to the case. The defendant Hou Dachun either intended to profit during wartime, speculating and manipulating military supplies or daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, hindering supply and demand, or infringing upon public property and harming the public, or embezzling public funds and seeking private gain, harming the major interests of the state, or receiving bribes or other improper benefits for his official conduct. Although the crimes are different, the nature of the crimes is the same, and they are based on a general intent, so they should be treated as one crime. The defendant Hu Zheng continuously inflated the procurement of rice to a large amount of 30 million yuan, manipulating and speculating, using all means, affecting military grain and people's food, to a deep and great extent. The facts of his crime have a relationship of method and result, so he should be punished more severely. The defendants, as food administrative officials, only sought private gain and disregarded the difficulties of the time, which is truly unforgivable. They should each be severely punished to serve as a warning. The Western-style clothes and other items involved in the case should be confiscated, and the bribes and improper benefits should be recovered and confiscated.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Organization Regulations of the Special Court of the National Government, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law, Articles 1, 2, 3, 7, Paragraph 2, 8, 9, and 21 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Embezzlement by Public Officials, Article 11, Article 28, Article 56, Article 55, and Article 38, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>March 14th, 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen En, Chief Judge of the Special Court of the National Government (seal), Qiao Wanxuan, Judge (seal), Qian Sen, Judge (seal). This document is certified to be identical to the original. Pan Chengyin, Clerk. Jiang Wumian, Clerk. Zhu Jinghang, Clerk. March, 33rd year of the Republic of China</p>

<h3>Minister Chen Jian Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Minister of Construction Chen Chunpu delivered a speech to Chinese and foreign reporters during a routine reception on the 17th. The speech covered the recent situation of production increase and construction. This year is the year of production increase, and the increase in agricultural production is particularly important. What is related to the Ministry of Construction for the increase in agricultural production is the manufacture of new-style agricultural implements and the dredging project of Yinshan Lake in East Taihu Lake. Secondly, it is indeed traffic safety and the exchange of materials. The details are as follows: The Central Agricultural Implements Manufacturing Experimental Factory was planned and established in Wuxi in December of the 31st year and established on August 20th last year. The greatest goal of the establishment of this factory is to increase production and improve farming techniques. The quantity of products produced by this factory is insufficient to meet the demand. In the future, we should strive to increase production and achieve universality. There are currently more than 160 workers, and it is planned to increase it to 300 in the second year. It was organized and established in Suzhou in January and prepared for construction. First, a large dam will be built on Taihu Lake, and part of the main canal for irrigation will be contracted to merchants. As a result, the bid price was too high, and a new bid was made. A contract is now being signed, and construction will begin within one day. The recent general situation of road protection work is to strengthen the love for the Shanghai-Nanjing Line. The results of consultations with the Jiangsu Provincial Government are very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Since being ordered to purchase wheat in various locations in northern Jiangsu and elsewhere, the Business Coordination Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has achieved over 72% of its expected purchase volume. Barring any obstacles, it should be able to fulfill its mission.

To facilitate future work, the association has petitioned the Executive Yuan to order the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui to exempt these taxes. The Executive Yuan, recognizing that wheat is a major food source, second only to rice in the needs of Jiangsu and Anhui, and essential for both military rations and the livelihood of the people, has approved the request and ordered the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui to comply.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle for Cassino in Italy Continues, U.S. Fifth Army Suffers Another Setback in Offensive</h3>

The U.S. military has decided to change its tactics this time. Large formations of enemy bombers relentlessly attacked Cassino from dawn, attempting to break the resistance of the German defenders. By noon, the U.S. military replaced the air raids with heavy howitzer fire and then launched an attack with strong infantry and tank forces. However, General Clark miscalculated again, suffering heavy losses and being repelled.

<p>It is widely spread that Mr. Yoshida Shōin is a model of a national hero. This is a great surprise to the author, who has been praising Mr. Shōin for over 60 years. What exactly did Mr. Yoshida Shōin do? Probably no one knew the difference between peacetime and wartime as well as Mr. Shōin. Mr. Shōin considered the time to be an extraordinary period. He believed that doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times was not only permissible but also necessary. The things that he did based on this belief, such as calling on those who were engrossed in meaningless formalities, were considered madness. Traveling without the permission of the lord was a violation of the lord's rules, but Mr. Shōin had promised Mr. Miyabe Teibei of the Kumamoto domain to study in the Northeast, and fearing that he would break his promise, he set out from the lord's residence without waiting for approval. At that time, traveling abroad was not permitted by national law, but if it was for official business, it was permissible, so he boarded the Perry flagship. Confucius said that a gentleman does not think beyond his position. However, Mr. Shōin, in his capacity as a samurai of the clan, either wrote to the lord or sent letters to ministers in Kyoto, hoping that the emperor would read them. To the so-called bureaucrats, everything that Mr. Shōin did was an overstep.</p>
<p>However, from today's perspective, right and wrong are clear. In extraordinary times, extraordinary things are needed. Doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times is the true meaning of the ordinary way. So today is not a time for leisure. Do not use the excuse that you are old, useless, or incapable to prevent others from serving, but rather cooperate and serve each other. It is wrong to excuse oneself by saying that one is old and incapable, or that one is unlearned and lacks energy, while indulging in pleasure and letting others serve. Those who cannot, there is nothing to be done, but all who can should cooperate. In society, there are also those who particularly want to serve but cannot find work. This is a great mistake. In such a society, to say that there is no work is punishable.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>If you say there is none, then you can pick up horse manure on the roadside! You can pick up fallen ears of grain in the fields after the harvest!</p>
<p>At this time, those who hesitate because they are concerned about their position or reputation are already out of step with the times. What is shameful about ladies working as seamstresses or maids? What is wrong with gentlemen working as day laborers? Of course, there is a need for servants, but is it impossible to manage without them? If you want tea or water, serve yourself. If everyone remembers that this is an extraordinary time, then Japan will accomplish many times more than it does today. I believe that 100 million people can do the work of at least 200 million people. Of course, this does not mean making even the frail old people or infants in arms work. If all those who can work do so with all their might, they will surely become a strong and impregnable fortress.</p>
<p>In society, there is an eight-hour workday. In democratic countries, it is even considered excessive, and working hours are gradually being reduced to seven or six hours. Some even advocate a maximum of five hours. However, these words are already outdated, they are words of a peaceful era, and today they are irrelevant. Of course, humans are animals and need rest, which must be considered at all times, even in extraordinary times. However, the limits on working hours that were advocated by liberal economists in the past are nothing more than delusions from the era when free-market liberalism was prevalent, and are no different from advocating birth control. If all workers work diligently, with a sincere love for the country, and work together, then even greater results than today can be achieved immediately. I am not saying that today's workers are idle or not working hard. Rather, I am saying that there must be an awareness of these extraordinary times, and this is not limited to workers, but should apply to everyone. That is to say, it is necessary not only to advocate age-based dedication to public service, but also rest-based dedication to public service. If 100 million people extend their working hours by one hour, then 100 million hours will be added. Of course, there are those who have already reached the limit of their labor, and there are children, the elderly, and the sick who should be deducted from this, but in any case, if everyone is determined to extend their working hours by one hour, then they will surely achieve amazing results.</p>
<p>What I am saying here is that the government authorities should take full, organized, and planned measures to ensure that those who are age-based dedicated to public service can find their place, and to open up a path for the effective use of time for those who are rest-based dedicated to public service. Well-ordered labor is twice as effective as chaotic labor. So, the coordination of labor power is essential. Being able to achieve the best of their abilities according to individual functions is the best way to maximize efficiency. Those with experience in earthwork should be assigned to earthwork, and those with calculation skills should be assigned to accounting. This is the most important thing. Asking a theater actor to wrestle, or a wrestler to play a stage role, will not yield good results even if the workers are exhausted. I think this is self-evident. Especially for today's conscription, if the qualities and experiences of the conscripts are not specifically assessed and used most effectively, then the result will be like pouring kerosene into the sea, turning the useful into the useless.

Any increase in capital due to asset appreciation, capital increase, or the use of accumulated surplus to supplement capital should be taxed according to regulations. In addition, the Finance Ministry's Income Tax Department has ruled that company distributions of surplus that do not pay dividends but only bonuses should be treated as dividends and taxed accordingly. We will dispatch personnel to conduct individual audits and urge tax payments, and we will also issue a notice. We hereby send a copy of the precautions and request your association to forward them to all members for compliance and to report the income and tax amounts of each category to this bureau accurately, and to provide relevant account books for inspection. Failure to report within the time limit or refusal to allow auditing will result in penalties in accordance with the regulations, and this bureau will directly determine the tax amount and request the court to enforce collection. The case concerns national taxes, and no delay is permitted."</p>

<h3>British and Americans Use Chongqing's Resources in an Attempt to Satisfy Their Ambitions, Minister Matsushima Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the head of the Japanese Fleet's Press Department stationed in China, gave a speech to the Chinese press corps yesterday (17th), as usual, as follows: Colonel said that the US Navy is frustrated over the lack of progress in the Pacific and is trying to solve its difficulties through political means, and that they intended to exploit China's land, manpower, and resources, to cooperate with Chongqing, and make a final decision on Japan. Regarding the point of using Chinese land and manpower, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz has already spoken, and there is no need to repeat the statement. Now we are just discussing his resources.</p>
<p>Reasons for Rising Prices in Kunming</p>
<p>Colonel Shen cited Reuters on March 16, saying that "Foreign Minister" Song Ziwen and "Finance Minister" Kong Xiangxi recently made a short trip to Kunming, where Kong told reporters that he would investigate the reasons for the rising prices in Kunming and study countermeasures. According to this news, it proves that the lives of the people of Kunming are currently extremely difficult. Minister Matsushima also presented a comparison table of prices between Kunming and Shanghai in September last year as evidence:</p>
<p>Kunming Shanghai</p>
<p>White Rice 1 Shi 2,464.00 Yuan 1,800.00 Yuan</p>
<p>Wheat Flour 1 Bag 968.00 Yuan 490.00 Yuan</p>
<p>Pork 1 Jin 60.00 Yuan 45.64 Yuan</p>
<p>Cooking Oil 1 Jin 82.00 Yuan 41.63 Yuan</p>
<p>Salt 1 Jin 30.00 Yuan 3.95 Yuan</p>
<p>Sugar 1 Jin 20.00 Yuan 33.00 Yuan</p>
<p>The Colonel explained that the reason for the high prices in Kunming was actually due to the large number of British and Americans stationed near Kunming. Although the British and Americans came to China, their luxurious lifestyle remained the same, without the slightest savings. Chongqing is like this, and Guilin is also like this. At the same time, Kunming is the terminal for British and American transport aircraft, and the transport aircraft taking away a large amount of Chinese materials is also one of the reasons for fueling the price hike.</p>
<p>Japan's Aim is to Seek Peace</p>
<p>Colonel Matsushima then pointed out that only a small number of British and Americans are currently stationed in Chongqing. If Nimitz's plan to use the Chinese mainland for operations is realized and a large number of British and American troops enter, two results will occur: The lives of the people will be even more difficult, and China's land will become a battlefield. The human resources will be sacrificed for the British and Americans, and the products will be reduced and lack, and eventually the people will not be able to survive and suffer unprecedented tragedies. Of course, Japanese soldiers and civilians are also stationed in China today and are supplied with some materials from China, but Japan's goal is to seek peace. The British and American gold plans are exactly the opposite. They intend to turn China into a battlefield, seize Chinese materials, and kill Chinese people to achieve their ambitions of conquering East Asia. The venom of Yin is unprecedented. The Colonel reiterated: The success or failure of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific War is related to the fate of China. The Japanese Navy is in favor, and China can maintain peace. On the contrary, China's mainland will be ravaged by the British and Americans. At present, China's participation in the Greater East Asia War is only a matter of material assistance. If the Chinese people can cooperate in the war with one yuan of resources, they can avoid the loss of tens of thousands of dollars in land, life, and property in the future.</p>

<h3>Public Basketball Unexpected Result: Donghua Defeats Hualian</h3>
<p>In the public basketball game, the Tongren and Yijia teams were exceptionally brave in the first game last night. They even tied in the second half, but Zhongbei defeated Tongren 48-30 due to too many points lost in the first half. In the final game of the first division, Hualian played against Donghua. The two sides fought fiercely. In the first half, Hualian took a 18-15 lead by three points. After switching sides, the situation became even more tense, and the scores fluctuated, resulting in several ties. When time ran out, the score was tied 29-29. In overtime, Hualian was defeated by Donghua 31-35, which can be said to be an unexpected upset. There were originally eight games scheduled for tomorrow, but since the Lianyunhua team of the first division has announced its withdrawal, there are only seven games left.</p>

<h3>Jishan Cup Small Football Tournament, Four Games Today</h3>

<h3>It Is Better to Rely on Yourself Than on Others</h3>
<p>It is better to rely on yourself than on others, which encourages people to invigorate themselves and not to have a dependent mentality, because relying on others may involve a vague hope, while relying on oneself at least has a considerable degree of certainty. In today's environment where rice is not sufficient for allocation, not only rice merchants, but even the rice management authorities, probably still hold on to the most unhealthy idea in the previous food policy, which is to spend all day managing how to import foreign rice, thinking that foreign rice can be relied on without fear. Now, because of the difficulties during wartime, the import of foreign rice is naturally impossible to guarantee, and even if it is transported with great difficulty, it feels like "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." Therefore, it is too superficial to rely on foreign rice to supply domestic food today.</p>
<p>It is better to rely on yourself than on others. Instead of relying on the supply of foreign rice, it is better to work hard to increase the production of domestic rice. In today's serious food problem, first, it is necessary to ensure the supply of domestic food needs; second, it is necessary to remove rice from the category of commodities. Therefore, we have always sympathized with a few words said by the Continental News on October 11 last year: "Determining the purchase price of rice, limiting merchants' profits, and eliminating farmers' reluctance to sell are the most appropriate policies for today's food problem."</p>
<h3>Flour Professional Committee to Acquire Flour Bran, Continuing to Borrow 50 Million Yuan, Adopting a Current Account Mortgage Overdraft Method</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, in order to raise funds for the acquisition of wheat, has previously jointly established a loan of 100 million yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking groups. Due to the need for funds to acquire flour bran, it has continued to borrow 50 million yuan from Chinese and Japanese banking groups. The lending method is a current account mortgage overdraft, with the warehouse storage receipt of flour bran as collateral, with a mortgage period of six months and an interest rate of 8% per annum. It is reported that the purpose of this fund is to purchase flour bran from various factories and allocate it uniformly, and at the same time enable various flour mills to re-open acceptance bills with funds and continue to purchase wheat.</p>
<h3>Grain Bureau Legally Inspects Merchants' Qualifications</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Flour Bran Unified Allocation Office yesterday sent a letter to the Tea Industry Association and other associations, stating: "Regarding the letter from the Shanghai Special City Grain Bureau stating that among the member merchants of various grain industry associations, there are many who have not yet applied for registration, and many who falsely claim to be legal merchants and fraudulently receive flour allocations. In order to eliminate abuses and prevent problems, it is proposed that your office conduct a qualification check on the various grain industry associations' merchant shops under the jurisdiction of this bureau before the allocation. Those who fail to present the registration certificate approved by this bureau are not legal merchants and should not be allocated, so as to prevent those who use skillful language from flowing into the black market, etc." In order to understand whether all members of your association who have obtained flour allocation have obtained the Grain Bureau registration certificate for verification, this office is hereby writing to request your association to quickly collect these registration certificates and submit them to this office for processing.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Registration, Deadline for Completion</h3>
<p>The City Economic Bureau stipulates that the registration and modification registration of various companies, except for cases where the attachments of the cases submitted to the Ministry of Industry are incomplete or do not meet the regulations, must be completed within seven days. For industrial and commercial registration, all cases of industrial and commercial firms applying for registration that are found to be consistent with the investigation must be completed within two weeks, so as to expedite the issuance of certificates.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Will Request Adjustment of Evaluation System</h3>
<p>In order to strive for the welfare of the same industry and to make the evaluation system effective, so that merchants and people can benefit, various industry associations will jointly request the competent authorities to consider the difficulties of merchants and make efforts to thoroughly adjust the evaluation system within a time limit, so as to achieve perfection. When evaluating and setting the price limit for a certain item, the wholesale price of the trade should be used as a starting point, and then the focus should be shifted to the firm, using its wholesale price as a guideline to give legitimate profits, evaluate and set the standard price limit, and when allocating goods, an invoice must be issued for verification, otherwise, it is difficult to avoid pretexts.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Railway Transportation</h3>
<p>— (Ma Jiazhang)</p>
<p>The improvement of railway transportation can be discussed in terms of passengers and transportation.</p>
<p>In terms of passengers, the first problem to be improved should be the excessive crowding of passengers. As long as this problem can be solved, passengers can at least reduce a large part of the suffering of the journey. From the current situation, it is already clear that the crowding of passengers is not a sign of true prosperity, but is entirely caused by too many people traveling on their own. Of course, the best way to improve the excessive crowding of passengers is to eliminate those who travel on their own. This responsibility should be borne by three parties simultaneously. The first is that the control authorities can strengthen control, the second is that the railway authorities can make the transportation of materials completely smooth, and the third is that passengers can have a deep realization themselves.</p>
<p>Improving the ticket sales method can also reduce the degree of passenger crowding. Ticket sales offices can all be set up outside the station and work all day long. This can give passengers a long period of time to purchase tickets, eliminate the crowding of passengers when purchasing tickets, and eliminate black market tickets and all the malpractices of ticket sales. The ticket sales office can also, based on statistics of the general number of passengers to various places, and in conjunction with the maximum capacity of the train, easily calculate the average maximum number of passengers to various places each day. Based on this number, the ticket sales office can decide the number of tickets sold to various places each day and limit the number of passengers, so that passengers who cannot purchase tickets do not run to the station in vain to squeeze. Therefore, it can also reduce the crowding scene in the military station and carriage. The ticket sales office can also pre-sell tickets for the next day on the first day, and shorten the usefulness of the ticket to only one day. This may be able to avoid the manipulation of many unscrupulous people.</p>
<p>The current train fares are too high for first class, second class, and third class. Most passengers are daunted and unable to afford first class or second class. Therefore, too many seats in the first and second class carriages are wasted. This waste is usually only a loss to the railway authorities, but today, when vehicles are in short supply and passengers are very crowded, this unnecessary waste is too inappropriate and unreasonable. Therefore, we hope that the railway authorities can completely eliminate the various meanings of first-class cars, and even the seats in second-class cars should be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>We hope that the arrangement of the schedule can be more precise, so that the time for shunting is reduced as much as possible, and the train running time must be accurate. This can not only reduce the pain of passengers squeezing in the carriage, but also increase the efficiency of passenger cars. In addition, the ticket checking time can also be brought forward as much as possible. Railway employees should be trained to be disciplined and upright, and should be able to provide passengers with guidance and assistance everywhere.</p>
<p>Passengers' lack of order often increases their own suffering. Lack of order seems to be an inferiority of our people. But we cannot just not improve on this. Therefore, I hope that every passenger can take into account the interests of everyone. For example, when checking tickets, checking tickets, boarding, and getting off the bus, they can follow the order, and they do not necessarily have to squeeze desperately. Especially when getting on and off the bus on the way, there are two doors in the east and west sides of the bus. We can use them, one exclusively for getting off the bus and one exclusively for getting on the bus. This can not only avoid chaotic and crowded situations, but also save passengers time and effort.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, making the transportation of materials smooth and unhindered, the most ideal method in theory is to increase the number of vehicles. However, in today's war state, under the condition of military first, this is often impossible to achieve. But if we can improve the organization, management, planning, and means of material transportation, even with the least number of vehicles, we can make them exert their greatest capabilities and show their greatest effects. Now briefly stated as follows:</p>
<p>Research on the efficiency of transportation trains: Generally, people often think that if the carrying capacity of vehicles can be used as much as possible, even if the speed is very low, the maximum efficiency of the vehicles can be obtained. This is actually a specious view. Because the performance of transportation train efficiency is neither the size of the load nor the speed, but a balance between the two, so that it can be just right. Therefore, the study of the combination of load and speed is still the most important thing in transportation. Because merely increasing the load of vehicles does not necessarily result in the greatest use of efficiency. Of course, on shorter main lines and roads with less material transportation, transportation trains often have to pick up and drop off military vehicles along the way and load and unload goods. Therefore, the load is different along the way, and the parking time is longer, so it is difficult to talk about the combination of load and speed. However, on roads with longer lines and more material transportation, there must be many trains composed of whole carloads of goods, traveling longer distances, and not having to stop along the way, or stopping very little. The railway authorities should study the economy of load and speed for these vehicles, in order to obtain the greatest efficiency of the average time of the vehicles.</p>
<p>In order to implement the above suggestions, the author believes that the railway authorities today should study the following points, determine considerable standards, and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>1. Determine the most economical speed and load tonnage of various vehicles on each section of the line.</p>
<p>2. Stipulate the performance standards that various vehicles should have on each section of the line, so as to compare them with actual performance at any time.</p>
<p>3. Study the vehicle grouping method to reduce the stopping time in each section.</p>
<p>4. For vehicles that do not need to stop or stop very little in each section, their travel times should be stipulated in detail and strictly observed, and efforts should be made to avoid the waste of time waiting for other vehicles.</p>
<p>Using empty vehicles to transport: It is common for railway companies to have empty vehicles in transportation. However, this loss is great, especially now that the number of military vehicles is insufficient, this phenomenon can no longer be tolerated. Therefore, railway managers should strive to reduce the mileage of empty vehicles. If there are too many empty vehicles, in addition to improving the vehicle dispatching method, a fundamental remedy should be sought, which is to increase transportation in the direction of empty vehicles.</p>
<p>Decision on the priority of cargo transportation: Although whatever methods of improvement are imagined in cargo transportation today, the shortage of vehicles is a fact. Therefore, the power of vehicles to transport cargo is limited. When using limited power to transport cargo, of course, the nature and needs of various cargoes should be carefully studied. There should be a decision on who should transport first and who should transport later. The standard for this decision is to look at the degree of relationship between each cargo and the lives of the people today.</p>
<p>The rapid loading and unloading of cargo: The result of the rapid loading and unloading of cargo can of course reduce many of the ills caused by delays. The turnover of vehicles is therefore flexible, so it indirectly increases the transportation efficiency of cargo vehicles.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Regarding the letter from Mr. Zheng Zhi of your esteemed Education Department, received yesterday, which briefly stated that, according to the number of fees paid for a new bicycle license, the amount did not match the receipt, etc. After investigation, the fee rates for various vehicles have been publicly announced by this bureau and posted at each registration office. If there is any overcharge, it is permissible to report it. This bureau's supervision of its subordinates has always been strict. If, upon investigation, there is verifiable evidence, there will be absolutely no leniency or indulgence. However, fearing that our oversight may be incomplete, we earnestly seek broad public opinion, hoping for cooperation from all levels to jointly improve. If what you have stated is indeed true, we will certainly rectify the situation thoroughly. We hope you will provide detailed information regarding the registration location and date, the original vehicle number, along with the receipt and other items that can provide proof, and prepare an official document to personally come to the bureau for a thorough investigation. Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. (Note: This newspaper has received many such letters from readers recently, but due to space limitations, we are unable to publish them all.)</p>
