<h3 id="c1">說話世界大勢 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 胡蘭成</p>
<p>我把這次世界戰爭分做三個階段：閃電戰的階段，物資戰的階段，與政治戰的階段</p>
<p>反軸心國有優勢的物資，但物資未及動員，巳給軸心國的閃電戰佔了便宜。現在，軸心國的物資動員起來了，同時，軸心國的政治戰也已展開，尤共是大東亞各國的大束亞宣言的發表。則結束戰爭，決定勝敗的還是不在於物資。</p>
<p>世界政治戰的方而，一是敵英美國內的工商問題，二是蘇聯國內的革命問題，三是中立國輿半中立國的游離問題，四是歐洲的動亂問題，五是中國與印度的問題。</p>
<p>美國的工人運動沒有過嚴重的失敗。所以它的元氣一直是很旺的。戰時美國工潮統計數字大於任何國，現在政府是以軍管理來制止，這雖能收一時之效，但工人的鬥爭對象因此由資本家移轉到政府，工潮之由經濟的鬥爭走到政治的鬥爭，亦將因此而更明郎，其震盪之力將於本年總統選舉中見之。</p>
<p>英國的工潮統計數宇不及美國，但英國工潮的政治鬥爭化還比美國更走在前頭。這是因爲英國的產業戰時管理制度較美國更早成立，也更嚴格，並且因爲英國的政府較美國的更不健康之故。凡是工潮由經濟的鬥爭走上政治的鬥爭，中閒往往要經過一個此較沉寂的時期，而後以十倍百倍的力量爆發出來。大不列顚帝國是要總崩潰的，無論反軸心是勝是敗。</p>
<p>蘇聯的解放第三國際，不僅僅是爲了使英美可以安心，同時也爲了打擊列寗主義在蘇聯境內的殘餘。而迫到要打擊這殘餘的時候，也就可見這殘餘已在重新發生作用，對史太林政權有所不利了。史太林政權也懼怕共產主義，這在今日，是早已無須驚訝的。還有，幾個月前史太林政權宣佈蘇聯各邦有獨立的外交權，這是爲的把克林姆宮的責任分散，轉嫁於各邦，不僅對外如此，同時對內亦如此。人民要是不滿，對各邦不滿就是了，牽涉不到史太林政權的頭上；各邦彈壓人民的反抗，也牽涉不到斯太林政權的頭上。斯太林政權倒成了各邦對人民的中間人，以此中間人的身份保持政治現狀的平衡。然而這樣的平衡是極部穩定的。</p>
<p>反軸心方面的半中立國，和中立國，她們沒有受到戰爭的破壞，或只受到很輕的損傷，隨着英美蘇的處境漸漸嚴重，她們便漸漸倔强。英美對她們的壓力是有分寸的，不由你高興不高興。阿根廷就是一個例子，美國對付她的辦法並不多。大凡這些國家，有許多是半殖民地國家，她們的漸漸倔强，便是和這次戰爭的漸漸對立。</p>
<p>歐洲現正苦於共產主義騷動的激化，這是希特勒的負担，但也是羅斯福與邱吉爾的負担。無論歐洲方面的戰爭在任何情况之下結束，結束之日同時也就是這騷動的總爆發與延燒的正式開始。英美莫以爲有撲滅這大火的本領，連蘇聯都將被震倒，因爲這騷動的立塲是在軸心與反軸心的對立之外的，而且也是和斯太林政權衝突的。所以，歐洲方面的戰爭一結束，英美的困難將驟然加重。</p>
<p>在東方，我以爲決勝的地點不在於太平洋上的島嶼，而在於印度。印度境內現在是飢饉，與民衆自發的騷動，而國民會議派的活動則相形之下倒見得沉寂。其所以沉寂的原因，固在於英國的加强壓力，還更在於印度的時代要求已超過國民會議派，使國民會議派也失措。在此期間，國民會演派中革命的政黨正在漸漸造成，抬頭，醞釀着新的鬭爭局面。而在目前，則英國已不敢信任印度的軍隊。大柬亞戰爭帶給印度的是獨立，但在戰爭結束之前或之後實現獨立，對於世界的全盤局勢有不同的深刻影響，要爭取之點是在於此。</p>
<p>印度問題和中國問題幾乎是不可分的。中國能以最大協力而完遂大東亞戰爭，則印度的獨立運動將受列强大無比的推動力，而在大東亞戰爭結束之前實現獨立。至於中日關係，只有中日兩國同時革新，兩國纔能成立新關係。</p>
<p>英美國內的工潮問題，蘇聯國內的革命問題，中立國與半中立國的游離問題，歐洲的動亂問題，巾國與印度的問題，這些都是互相關聯的，併合成爲一個問題。誰能把握這世界政治鬭爭的局面，誰就是勝利者。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍分兩路進攻達姆英印軍潰敗　仁巴爾附近亦展開激戰中 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　印細邊境日軍，對如鮑谷地英印軍第二十師主力之一部所展開之殲滅戰，頃已達於最高潮。日軍自二十日以來，即在坦克車隊，重砲隊之協力下，急追敗退之英印軍·予以重創，蓋日軍於攻佔威特庫後，二十一日以來復猛攻達姆南方一公里之耍衝巴達。日軍先鋒部隊曾在該地北方攻繫携有迫擊砲之敵軍約四百人，予以重創。又南下之日軍於二十二日八時進抵達姆北方四公里之某地，準備由南北兩路攻入敵軍第二十師根據地達姆，敵軍己總崩潰，沿達姆巴來爾公路潰走，日軍機械化部隊則追隨之與之痛擊，又攻入印境之日軍。與印度國民軍協力。在達姆西北方十二公里某地附近，扼制敵軍退路，加以猛攻，使敗敵大爲混亂。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　日軍突入印度領內之消息，似使英。美兩國野朝人士深爲驚愕與憂慮。據合衆社紐約電稱、日軍已在三處地點突破印度國境，刻在仁巴爾附近展開激戰，並承認目前情勢已臨危機才階段。又聞日軍一部隊向反軸心軍重要基地仁巴爾進攻，現僅差一十英里。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　緬印西北部國境戰鬥。正在莫加溫溪谷上流展開中，又據新穗里消息，日印軍目前之作戰目的，在占領反軸心軍重要補給共地馬尼布爾。若該地陷落，則無異予日印軍以攻取阿薩密之重要基地，而日印若進一步對阿薩密發動政勢時、則斯蒂維爾軍隊及中部地區反軸心軍之印度東部鐵道將被切斷，而對目前情勢之　展，深感憂慮。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日內閣决定　戰時研究員 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日研究動員會議，爲發揮日本戰爭科學技術之總力，以期確立科學兵器戰及生產增强戰之必勝體制，計自去歲十月以來，即就陸，海軍技術院，軍需省所提交之戰時研究課題及戰時研究員之選定問題，愼重進行審議，頃對豫定之研究員均已决定。於該豫定者中决定大學關係四十三人，官吏十一人，民間十二人，共六十六人爲第一次，主任戰時研究員，已於二十四日由內閣正式任命，又第二次人選亦擬於最近發表。</p>
<h3 id="c4">緬召開第三屆　樞密院會議 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　緬甸政府自二十日起召開第三屆樞密院會議，首由政府代表說明政府方面自去　召開第二屆會議後，政府實行之十四項施策及今後之重要計劃，其中關於最近之施策及計劃最使人注目者，即爲縣行政機構之强化及企劃院之設置。全細除西重縣等二縣之外，共三卞四縣，各縣之等級共分三等，即一等縣十五，二等縣十五，三等縣四，爲推進緊急之戰時施策，近特將其中臨近敵區之各縣劃爲一等縣，而其他各縣分別劃爲二等縣或三等縣，至一等縣除設知事外，并設置副知事。又下級官吏之自由任免權，則賦與地方各蘭，同時爲謀地方行政之刷新及强化，以遂行戰爭計，并劃定獎賞辦法，以獎勵協力戰之縣民。又政府　近將創設直屬內閣之企劃院，在日本顧問之協助下，實行國策之基本企劃，預料於該院創設後，緬甸國政將有飛躍之進展，故各方咸期待甚殷。</p>

<p>東京二十五日中央社電日第八十四屈議會開會式，二十五日上午十一時在貴族院全體會議塲舉行，到有東條首相以次　閣僚及松平，佐佐木貴族院正副議長，岡田·內崎衆議院正副議長以次兩院全體議員，準時開會後，首由東條首相恭讀優渥之勅語，由松平貴族院議長拜受勅語書後，閉院式遂吿終了。</p>
<h3 id="c6">汪主席　電鮑斯致賀 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　印度國民軍此次與日軍協力作戰，日前已突破印細國境，踏入印度本國國土，我汪主席特電鮑斯主席致賀原電如下：「自由印度臨時政府鮑斯主席閣不，欣悉貴主席率領印度國民軍與盟邦日本軍協力，突破印細國境，進入貴國國土，驅逐敵軍，成此光榮之創舉，至爲欽佩，特電申賀，並祝閣下政躬康泰，中華民國國民政府主席汪兆銘。」</p>
<h3 id="c7">南太平洋空戰　繼續進行中　日軍某大尉談述實况 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據南方日軍某基地電，刻南太平洋戰綫之空軍决戰，仍在繼續進行，此故爲一大消耗戰，同時亦爲激烈之補給戰·波根維爾島海面海空戰·前後共計六次，敵艦船已蒙重大損失及飛機之大量消耗，此對敵之補給戰影響甚鉅。日軍某航空隊某大尉頃就南太平洋空戰之實况發表談話，其大意謂：前綫空軍勢力之優力，自與國內飛機生產量具有連帶關係，然軍勢力之優劣，非僅以此支配如何於缺時間內迅速補足連續决戰所消耗之勢力，整備空軍陣容，亦極重要，此即所謂飛機之補給戰是也。整備空軍陣容之遲速，對戰局具有重大影響，美國雖誇爲世界飛機生產最多之國家，然對悠長之補給路綫與連續之决戰，大感苦悶，尤其美機常爲軸心軍擊落，駕駛員或陣亡或被俘　及因而失蹤，補充極感困難。最惹注目者，厥爲最近敵駕駛員之素質己漸低下，戰鬥機可能作戰者，僅爲編隊長機，其餘陸屬伴隨，而頗多不熟悉駕駛方法，我戰鬥機飛起突擊敵陣後，敵機羣即紛紛遁走。殆不能以單機行動，敵之戰術更不値一顧，敵機僅伴隨編隊長機，全無單機之實戰能力。</p>

<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本銀行副總裁澀澤氏，自擢昇總裁後，其遺缺經石渡藏相及澀澤總裁愼重銓衡之結果，已决定由谷口大藏次官網任。至大藏次官之遺缺，决由主稅局長松隈秀雄氏繼任·二十四日業由政府發表任命。</p>
<h3 id="c9">德蘇春季戰綫槪况 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>自　疆掩的蘇聯歐洲部份的大原野·每年到四月間，凍結的大地裂開，春水融化積雪，地面成爲一片泥海，這就是所謂「泥將軍」，目下就要來臨了，所以德蘇的第三次冬季戰爭，巳到總結束的階段。</p>
<p>自去年七月以來，德軍對於節節反攻的紅軍，採取縮短戰綫的策略，戰綫著著西移，現在入於攻防戰，和開戰一個月後的狀熊彷彿，目下的戰綫。北起愛沙尼亞東北部的那魯維亞，南迄克里米亞半島的克赤地區，全錢當於凹凸性，蜿蜓達二千三百公里。由戰局的推動，大體可分爲中北部和南部兩戰綫：</p>
<h3 id="c10">中北部戰綫 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>過去二年半來，地位做次於莫斯科的蘇聯第二大都會列寧格勒特，城南接連德軍最前棧陣地，不斷受車砲轟擊的威脅，紅軍數度包圍突破敵軍陣地，屢消失敗。但自去夏南部戰綫戰事激比，邱布勒元帥所轄北路德軍，移動一部兵力，不暇兼顧的時候，紅軍即利用機會，於本年一月中句，自奧拉寗巴姆（列寗格勒特西面三十公里處）經過城南郊，沿伊爾門湖實行總反攻。</p>
<p>這路紅軍，包括古維奧洛夫大將率領的列寗格勒特戰綫軍，梅列茲柯夫大將的維魯霍夫戰綫軍，人數達〇〇萬，全國冬季配備·古維奧洛夫軍的主力沿芬蘭灣向愛沙尼亞前進，梅列茲柯夫則企圖遮斷列寗格勒特與—樸斯柯夫問的鐵道。木年一月底新編成的紅軍第二波羅的海戰綫軍（司令官蒲波夫大將）亦與前兩軍呼應，自伊爾門湖南部起，在西南面的諾佛索克里尼地區（維利基盧基西方）發動，由三面向邱希勒部德軍夾攻。</p>
<p>最近一閱月餘以來古維奧洛夫的紅軍，越過愛沙尼亞邊境而至那魯維亞要鎭的郊外，但遭遇德軍的堅决抵抗，雙方現尚相持不下。中央的梅列茲柯夫部紅軍，攻陷伊爾門湖北面諾佛格洛特，進至列寗格勒特—樸斯柯夫鐵道，自北而向樸斯柯夫推進，同時蒲波夫部紅軍，遣右翼部隊自杜諾方面進，向幾斯柯夫移動，一方面企圖以左翼部隊向拉脫維亞突入。</p>
<p>準此而論·北部戰綫的焦點，在於那魯維亞和樸斯柯夫兩城·那魯維亞爲愛沙尼亞北面的鬥戶，樸斯柯夫爲其南門，並爲聯接拉脫維亞鐵道幹綫的要地，紅軍企圖奪還波羅的沿岸的愛沙尼亞和拉脫維亞等國，極爲明顯。假定此舉部份的實現，在軍事上面，對於德國無關痛癢，反堕入德國誘導戰術的　中，而收出血之功。從政治方面面論，可以利用愛沙尼亞和拉脫維亞之處也很少。此際邱希拉元帥已獲得新銳部隊增援，在邱特伏湖（貝彼斯湖）的南北，佈價堅固陣地，一面愛沙尼亞和拉脫維亞的義勇軍也參加防衛戰，行見紅軍的兵站綫延長，有一擊而下之勢。</p>
<p>自尼維里地區起，經維合蒲斯克，洛茄契夫到莫斯伊里西方，以白俄羅斯爲舞臺的中部戰綫，也展開激戰，與北部相應合。防軍方面爲克里克元部指揮下的德國中央軍，攻軍方面爲羅柯索夫斯基大將的白俄羅斯戰綫紅軍，及巴格拉米揚大將的波羅的戰綫軍，戰塲自有名的普里貝特潮濕地帶始，到處是河川沼澤，這些沼澤凍結之後，構成德軍有利的陣地。</p>
<p>巴格拉米揚部軍隊，從去年十一月開始，日在尼維里，維特波斯克兩地區展開攻勢，尙在半途停止狀態中，同時羅柯索夫斯基部軍隊也自戈梅利西進，出入莫斯伊里地區，不能更向西方突入，乃轉慶先鋒，從二月下旬開始，自尼伯河上游的羅加契夫出動，該地當舊波蘭領土東部的公路，並可經由蒲樸魯伊斯克城通遠白俄羅斯苜府叫斯克城。羅柯索夫斯基軍企圖進入明斯克乃至舊波蘭領土，則意顯然可見，但前途尙屬渺茫，加以春季到來，積雪融解，渡涉沼澤，將發生很大的困難。中部戰綫的主軸，無論怎樣說也不外是自奧爾　至明斯克的所謂「拿破崙街道」，亦即貫通莫斯科和中歐的大幹綫，大槪這條幹綫一日在德軍手中，德軍的　的連洛，即一日部會動搖的（未完）。（譯自三月五日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 長風</p>
<p>維持治安，保衛閭閻，是警察的責任，也是人民的耍求。主海爲通商巨埠，人口五百萬，中外雜處，衆目睽睽，治安之能否維持，警察之是否盡職，不僅屬於內政問題，並且關係國際視聽。可是我們要求治安良好，警察盡職，那末我們就應該對於警察現在的生活問題，加倍注意，代謀解决。</p>
<p>照我們所知道的，　在警察的收入，每人每月至多不過一千餘元，拿這戔戔的收入，來維持個人生活尚且不夠　　論一家數口，人類要有理智，要有同精心，對於當前每一件事，都應該多方面的分析研究，像題在社會各方面的論調。都一致不滿整察的服務精神，他方面却不當悉心研究精神退化的重大原因，這種論調，是毫無價値的，其結果非特於事無補，更適足以債事。</p>
<p>最近一區警察局當局發起以四千萬元組織警察消費合作社，無論這個組織和這點經費。對於改善一萬餘警察生活究竟能有多大幫助，其用意係爲解決警士生活問題，提高服務精神，是毫無疑義的。那末每一市民就都應該當仁不讓，盡力贊助，實做到有錢出錢，有力出力的地步。於此我們希望明達的社會各業領袖以及富有者，拿本身的生活，和警士的牛活來作一比較，拿事業的前途，和地方治安的關係來作一分析，認淸環境，放大眼光，並充分發揮同情的精神。勿以一身一業爲衆矢之的。同時，我們對於主持組織合作社的諸公，也有如下的幾點意見來貢獻：</p>
<p>合作社應包括全市警察，不應限於一區。</p>
<p>營運資金應擴充至一萬萬元，由警察當局邀請金融界組織銀團，予以低利貸放，並商請中儲准以半數轉做貼放，以購入貨品爲擔保，並由區公署負承還保證責任。</p>
<p>要求統制機關經常配給各種日用品，應予以採　之便利。</p>
<p>此外，我們對於市政常局也有一點要求，自維消費特稅實行以後。加以物價日漲，市財政收入當然增加很多。究竟目前市財政全部收入爲數幾何。其支配情形又如何，凡屬納稅者都有明瞭的責任和義務。我們主張財政應該絕對公開，用途應該經過納稅代表者的審核，成立民意機關固非咄嗟問可以立辦，至少應該由市政機關延聘各界人士和市政　家先行組織市政經費審核委員會，處理這個問題　也許可以節省出一部份不必要的開支，來作進一步改善警察待遇的幫助，這纔是提高警察服務精神，整飭警察紀律的根本辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c34">辦理臨時配給布疋 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>本會奉令收買上海地區紗布以來，倐已半載，本市棉布市塲停頓已久，本會有鑒一般市民對於棉布之需要頗爲迫切，經决定棉製品集中配給辦法，未　施以前，先行辦理本市臨時配給棉布一次，外間對於此次棉布臨配工作，期待固極殷切，而本會亦正爲此事盡最大之努力。茲再將有關各事分別申述於後，俾期週知。</p>
<p>購布須知</p>
<p>上海特別市政府依統制綫內市民人口總數，分發商統會印製之「購布證」每人一紙。　一購布證一分別標明棉布零售商號之號數，持證人須向指定的商號講買，每證限購棉布中尺一丈五尺，其種類花色，就該零信商號所存受配發售之各種棉布內任擇一種。　零售　號發售各種棉布之價格，則商統會遵照行政院核定之標準價現定公布之。　市民購買棉布應將「購布證」繳由該商號收　註銷，並應向取發票，持憑　帶通行。　「購布證」之有效期間，自發證日起六個月內爲限。　「購布證」不得損汚途改，如有遺失，概不補發。</p>
<p>棉布價格</p>
<p>照原收買價格加倍計算，外加批發商利澗百分之十，零售商利澗百分之二十，例如十二磅龍頭細布原收買價，每尺爲三元七角五分，加倍計爲七元五角，外加批發商及零售商利潤百分之三十，每尺計爲九元七角五分，屆時當　將各項布匹詳細價目廣爲公布週知。</p>
<p>零售商號編</p>
<p>本市零售棉布商共有七百數十家，經布號　公會按各商號平日營業數額分爲甲·乙·丙·丁甲級，甲等商號每家得承配購布證六千號以上，乙等商號每家得承配講布證四千號，丙等商號每家得承配購布證二千號，丁等商號數家得合配購布證二千號，各零售商之號次，即按路綫依次排列，除著布號業公會製備零售商號碼招貼，分發各零售商懸貼於門面顯明處所外，並編造零售商號次名稱地址一覽　，一俟印就再行分發公布。</p>
<p>四購布證</p>
<p>此次臨時配給棉布之購布證，係仿照購米證樣式，現豐趕印，印竣後先發交各該承配之零售商編號蓋印，再送交本會　集後轉送市政府依照米票辦法分發，大約下月十日即可分區普發。惟爲防杜疏弊起見，不得不鄭重將事。再此次臨時配給之棉布，係就各零售商現存散裝布疋　先配給，不特品類繁多。同時爲使每一市民得能配得稱意之布疋起見，會規定零售商應將配給之布陳列樣品，以憑選擇，惟以售完爲止。</p>

<p>最後由記者問：關於棉紗棉布永久配給問題，據稱：此事本會根據有政院核定之棉製品集中配給辦法第十二條規定，稱極考慮進行，將來歸由棉　統制委員會負責辦理，因其配給任務繁雜，必需經過妥善籌劃後實施，俾　行時不致發生流弊，旋即互相　討研究臨時配給棉布防止承配棉布之零售商配售棉布之流弊　擬將「購布證」於每一市民向指定零售商購就棉布後。即在購布證背面記明記布貨色及日期，以便由商統會核對。</p>

<p>日駐華大使館上海事務所田尻公使，此次榮任要職，上海市民福利協會，工商聯誼會，中國國民外交促進會，新聞聯合會等四團體，以公使在任期內爲時年餘，爲中日兩國提携及日對華新政策之實施貢獻頗多，爰於昨（二十五日）日下午四時，在外灘興亞大樓工商聯誼會會　廳，聯合舉行盛大歡送茶會，本市中日各界人士均熱烈參加，茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<h3 id="c47">出席題名 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>

<p>田尻公使蒞華年餘，政續卓著，對大東菲建設及改善中日關係，尤其上海各方面致力甚多，素爲各界所欽敬，而於本會等創設和發展，尤多實助，此更爲同人等所銘感不忘者，現在田尻公使即將　滬，同人等至誠希望田尻公使不遺在遠，仍本已往之熱忱，對上海各界時時予以指導，想田尻公使一定肯惠然允許的。</p>

<h3 id="c49">田尻致詞 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>今天承蒙盛會招待，復承主席贈　，很爲感幸。本人到任年餘，在此期間，大來亞戰爭日趨激烈。在太平洋方面的戰爭，結果怎樣，諸位之中，也一許有人發生懷疑。可是，本人相信太平洋方而，一島一嶼的得失，與整個戰局，並無决定的影響。日　軍隊在太平洋方面的防禦，很爲周密穩固。不久的將來，諸位一　可以得到很愉快的消息。</p>
<p>其次，在大陸方面的戰局，印度國民軍已經奮起協力日軍，越過細印邊境而進入　祖國境內，這是很値得興奮的消息。印度的解放，也是大東亞的解放，相信印度三萬萬民族，必能一致奮起，爲祖國解放而奮鬥，獲得獨立，從此推想，全東亞民族的解放，也可同時達到目</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，從上海的立塲說，是解放上海之戰，是建設新上海之戰，日本所給與上海的協力，是在建設新上海，并不是取英美而代之。從交還租界以後，即將過去英美設立的最高機關如董事會加以取消，這可證明日本爲建設新上海而施以協力，完全與英美的處理上海不同。</p>
<p>從經濟方面說，日木以一切活動力量。協助上海第一流經濟界人士，如商業統制總會的組織，做了很多事業。從文化方面說，一年以來，發揚中國文化，爲建設新上海　新中國，新東亞的實貴思想，一天天地發揚，</p>
<p>過去一年之中，爲　設新上海，在座諸位都很努力，本人雖覺力薄，但自問巳經盡　協助，回　一年來的成績，雖經各方面的努力，還是不能滿意。原因何在呢？我想主　的在於受戰爭的壓迫，大東亞戰爭的壓迫，今後雖一將繼續着，但諸位能繼續努力，相信新上海的建設，一定可以成功的。</p>
<p>戰爭的壓迫加重，今後益烈，這是悲觀的因素，然而，相反的也有樂觀的因素，足以打消悲觀因素。在最近數月之中，我們見到三個樂觀因素：</p>
<p>第一，政治的因素，無論那一個國家，都應有廉潔政治；中國亦然，如能從上至下，普及全國，一定會有很好的成效，不用本人解說，諸位都已瞭解，近來中國政治上已經見過有廉潔的趨向，這是第一的樂觀因素。</p>
<p>第二，經濟的因素，大東亞戰爭發生已逾兩年，中國參戰，　逾一年，現在是戰時，戰時經濟狀况，本來沒有完全自由的可能，旣在戰時，原不許可無戰時情緒，現在中日兩國人士都已逐漸了解這個意義，這是第二個樂觀因素。</p>
<p>第三，日本對華新政策的實施步驟，過去日本方面，也有不能一致的地方，尤其是對於日本對華新政策的理念如何，中日雙方不能一致，最爲遣憾。現在，無論理念方面，實施步驟方面，已經逐漸趨於一致，這是第三個樂觀因素。</p>
<p>如能善爲利用這三個樂觀條件，使之發展，則新上海的建設，新中國的建設，並不是困難的事。</p>
<p>回憶孫總理遣言，革命尚未成功，諄諄以廢除不平等條約爲念，亦即對外革命，如今不平等條釣巳經廢除，中國對外革命已告完成。而國內革命猶未完畢。尤値茲大東亞　爭期中，中國圍民，肩負建設大上海，及建設新中國之責任，殊爲艱鉅，日本方面，亦希望在座賭君，於國府領導下完成此重大使命，並更加努力奮鬥，而在日本之立塲。僑華居留民亦當協力中國。最後本人期望中日兩國關係更趨緊密。並對　大招待，表示無限感　。</p>
<h3 id="c50">船津致詞 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>略謂：田尻公使在任年餘，爲期雖　算長，可是，在這期間，正當興亞院收消，大東亞省成立，公使適於是時來滬出任第一任公使。同時，日本　華新政策，也於是時開始實踐。所以在公使任內，司謂資任特別艱巨。</p>

<p>上海市政府以本市各同樂公會芷式成立以來，多務於權利之爭，而於政府戰時經濟政策之推行，則甚少協力，殊屬非是，　爲促使各同　公會明瞭其本身應負之使命及切實抑平物價，依據公、暫行條例及實業部抑平物價會議决案，分令所屬糧經兩局，尅日商訂協助抑平物價獎懲　法。該兩局奉令後，現正積極着手會商中，俟取决，即行呈奉市府核奪施行云</p>

<h3 id="c56">東亞聯盟方案　大東亞戰爭善後問題 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 江亢虎</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰後，美總統咸爾遜提出國際聯盟方案，其用意何嘗不是，可惜只有原則而無條文，只有抽象的大綱而無具體的辦法，更可惜未經多方討論，充分準備，以致戰事結束時，此大好名詞，竟被英法野心家听利用。其後組織雖實現，但專為戰勝者所把拉操縱，等於帝國主義宰割弱小民族之工具，蓋自成立之頃，已可預決其有名無實有始無終矣。</p>
<p>今者第二次世界大戰又當最後決定之年，雖無人能懸斷其何時結東，如何結束，但戰事終必結束，且難保不意外迅速忽然結束，歐洲大局姑置勿論，東亞善後，雖有共榮圈新秩序及東亞聯盟之宣傳，而迄今未見切實方案之提出，諭者　謂今日尚言之過早，殊不知第二次大戰之發生，正因第十次大戰善後虐置之失宜，而第一次大戰善後處置之失宜，又因戰事結束前，對於國際聯盟，未經多方討論，充分準備使然。然則前車之覆，後車之鑒，今日　不先將柬亞聯盟之機構，　為部署規書，一日戰事結束，措手不及，忙中有錯、將又貽無窮之　憂，可不懼哉！</p>
<p>東亞聯盟一名義正大，宗旨單純，其原則四條，即政治獨立，軍事同盟，經濟提攜，文化溝通，亦頗姿曲周至，概括無遺。茲所亟　討論者，乃組織之形式與方法是也。鄙人曩對國際聯盟曾提供不少意見與批評，現擬參酌舊稿，別草新案，姑先舉網要數項公布，為東亞聯盟方案之嚆矢，大東亞戰爭善後之前提云爾。</p>
<p>東亞聯盟（下簡稱聯盟）由東亞現有各國家為單位，共同組織之。</p>
<p>聯盟各國如中國，日本，滿洲，泰國，印　，緬甸。菲律賓，為獨立國·馬來，爪哇，蘇門答臘，西里伯，婆羅洲，新幾內亞，為自治　。西藏，新　·蒙古，及越南，尚待調整。其所有政　，　一仍舊貫，但有自動改革者聽之。</p>
<p>聯盟各國中有特殊民族，應承認其自治百決之權。</p>
<p>聯盟應於週中地帶，特劃區域，組織成立，永久超然。</p>
<p>聯盟應分上下兩院，上院代表國家及民族，每一國家或一民族代表一人。下院代表人口，約計每千萬人公舉代表一人，大東亞十萬萬人口，應有　　一百人，其比例按各民族人口多寡定之。</p>
<p>上院除議政外，並設行政委員會，由上院代表互推組織之，上院議長兼行政委員長。下院除議政外，並設司法委員會，由下院代表互推組織之，下院議長兼司法委員長。</p>
<p>上下兩院各組　際軍警機關，為共同防衛治安，及強制執行判決之用，直接受聯盟之指揮。</p>
<p>兩院代　各保團籍，惟行政司法兩委員會，及國際軍驚機關之人員，必須脫離其本國籍，而改入聯盟之超然籍。</p>
<p>聯盟定中國日本印度三種為通用之語言文字，所有文件，必須三種並列，所有講詞，必須三種同譯。</p>
<p>聯盟特製通用貨幣，並規定各國貨幣之兌換率。</p>
<p>聯盟各國間郵政，電信，旅行券，關稅則等，務示統一。</p>
<p>聯盟終年常開，其代表則三年改任一次。上院代表由各國政府及各民族團體領袖指派，下院代表由各民族自由公開選舉。兩院議長各任期一年，連選得連任，以三年為限。</p>

<p>天空海闊（二）</p>
<p>無論如何，在江田島生活中最大的祭日。要算是這天了，軍樂隊不斷地奏着　樂之中，展開了那天慕的大食堂。那樣廣大的學生食堂，仍然收容不了這麼多數的人們。學校關係者以及畢業生的父兄，都參加會宴的。但與眞人的有關係的一個也沒有來。</p>
<p>「谷候補生，今天可以喝杯吧！」</p>
<p>「啊，謝謝您。」</p>
<p>真人將筷子伸到赤飯和烤銅魚的碟裏，喜喜地將酒杯拿起來了。學生館在就學的時候，是嚴厲禁酒的，唯有畢業式的時候，酒和啤濟，都可以喝的，但是運到唇邊的酒，並非　那被禁的果物似的美味。</p>
<p>「S教官，多受指教了。」</p>
<p>最初受到指教的教官，真人是最欽敬的。</p>
<p>在食堂中，歡聲四起，甚是愉快，但總不免有一種慌忙的色彩。畢業生們，並沒有回到家庭，或靜待就職的餘裕。這個祝宴後，他們就要乘着練習艦，到大海洋去。八雲和磐平二艦在江田內海待着他們。畢業－服務同日舉行，不容間髮。這也是海軍措置微妙的地方。</p>
<p>出食堂後，真人自校長以下，各敎官及S少佐夫人，俱樂部的女主人，都辭別過了。</p>
<p>「恭喜，谷君，——這不過一點心思，——」S少佐夫人送給他顏色紙條說着。</p>
<p>「那麼，祝你健康。」</p>
<p>「健康的——不要忘了來信。」</p>
<p>問下級生的別離，是最難堪的。</p>
<p>練習艦的短艇，巳經來在碼頭上，學生們都往上裝東西。候補生們，也舉着白手套的手，敬禮後繼續地上船了。別離時的握手，萬歲，別辭</p>
<p>眞人被命乘在磐手艦。登艦險點後，即刻「預備出口一的喇叭響了。船也在拔着錨。</p>
<p>今日握手相談</p>
<p>明朝兩水雲天，——</p>
<p>從送別的短艇唱着送別的歌。是「螢光曲」的曲子。在船舷上整列着的候補生們、如夢似醒的行着舉手禮。不久，用汗巾抹着眼淚的婦女們，也見着了。送到津久茂海邊來學校的短艇，行着「舉　禮」，行了最後的別離，——。</p>

<h3 id="e1">World Affairs Discourse <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Lancheng</p>
<p>I divide this world war into three stages: the stage of blitzkrieg, the stage of material warfare, and the stage of political warfare.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis powers have an advantage in materials, but before the materials could be mobilized, the Axis powers took advantage with their blitzkrieg. Now, the Axis powers' materials have been mobilized. At the same time, the Axis powers' political warfare has also begun, especially with the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration by the countries of Greater East Asia. Therefore, ending the war and determining victory or defeat still do not depend on materials.</p>
<p>The aspects of world political warfare are: first, the labor-management problems within Britain and the United States; second, the revolutionary problems within the Soviet Union; third, the vacillation of neutral and semi-neutral countries; fourth, the turmoil in Europe; and fifth, the problems of China and India.</p>
<p>The labor movement in the United States has not suffered any serious failures. Therefore, its vitality has always been very strong. The statistical figures for strikes in the United States during the war are greater than in any other country. Now, the government is using military administration to suppress them. Although this can have a temporary effect, the workers' struggle target is thus shifted from capitalists to the government, and the economic struggle of the labor movement will become more clearly a political struggle. The shock of this will be seen in this year's presidential election.</p>
<p>The statistical figures for strikes in Britain are not as high as in the United States, but the politicization of labor struggles in Britain is even further ahead than in the United States. This is because Britain's wartime industrial management system was established earlier and is stricter than that of the United States, and also because the British government is less healthy than the American government. Whenever a labor movement moves from an economic struggle to a political struggle, it often goes through a relatively quiet period before erupting with ten or a hundred times the force. The British Empire is going to collapse completely, regardless of whether the anti-Axis powers win or lose.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's dissolution of the Third International was not only to reassure Britain and the United States, but also to strike at the remnants of Leninism within the Soviet Union. The fact that it is being forced to strike at these remnants shows that these remnants are already resurfacing and are detrimental to the Stalin regime. The Stalin regime is also afraid of communism, which is no surprise today. Furthermore, a few months ago, the Stalin regime announced that the Soviet republics had independent diplomatic rights. This was to decentralize the responsibility of the Kremlin and pass it on to the republics, not only externally but also internally. If the people are dissatisfied, they are dissatisfied with the republics, which does not involve the Stalin regime. The republics suppress the people's resistance, which also does not involve the Stalin regime. The Stalin regime has become an intermediary between the republics and the people, maintaining the balance of the political status quo in this intermediary capacity. However, such a balance is extremely unstable.</p>
<p>The semi-neutral and neutral countries on the anti-Axis side have not been damaged by the war, or have only suffered very slight damage. As the situation of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union gradually becomes more serious, they gradually become more stubborn. The pressure that Britain and the United States put on them is measured, regardless of whether you are happy or not. Argentina is an example. The United States does not have many ways to deal with it. Generally, many of these countries are semi-colonial countries, and their gradual stubbornness is gradually opposed to this war.</p>
<p>Europe is currently suffering from the intensification of communist unrest. This is a burden for Hitler, but also a burden for Roosevelt and Churchill. No matter how the war in Europe ends, the day it ends will also be the official beginning of the total outbreak and spread of this unrest. Britain and the United States should not think that they have the ability to put out this great fire. Even the Soviet Union will be shaken, because the stance of this unrest is outside the opposition between the Axis and anti-Axis powers, and it also conflicts with the Stalin regime. Therefore, once the war in Europe ends, the difficulties of Britain and the United States will suddenly increase.</p>
<p>In the East, I believe that the decisive point is not in the islands of the Pacific, but in India. There is currently famine and spontaneous unrest among the people in India, while the activities of the National Congress Party seem rather quiet in comparison. The reason for its quietness lies in Britain's increased pressure, and even more in the fact that the demands of the Indian era have surpassed the National Congress Party, causing the National Congress Party to also be at a loss. During this period, revolutionary parties within the National Congress Party are gradually being formed, rising, and brewing a new situation of struggle. Currently, Britain does not dare to trust the Indian army. The Greater East Asia War brings independence to India, but whether independence is realized before or after the end of the war has different and profound impacts on the overall world situation. The point to strive for lies in this.</p>
<p>The India problem and the China problem are almost inseparable. If China can complete the Greater East Asia War with maximum cooperation, the Indian independence movement will receive an incomparably strong impetus and achieve independence before the end of the Greater East Asia War. As for Sino-Japanese relations, only when China and Japan both reform at the same time can the two countries establish a new relationship.</p>
<p>The labor-management problems within Britain and the United States, the revolutionary problems within the Soviet Union, the vacillation of neutral and semi-neutral countries, the turmoil in Europe, and the problems of China and India are all interconnected and combined into one problem. Whoever can grasp the situation of this world political struggle will be the victor.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Attacks Dam in Two Routes, the British Indian Army Collapses; Fierce Fighting Also Breaks Out Near Imphal <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army on the Indian border against part of the main force of the 20th Division of the British Indian Army in the area of ​​Rubo Valley has reached its climax. Since the 20th, the Japanese army, with the cooperation of tank units and heavy artillery units, has been rapidly pursuing the defeated British Indian army and inflicting heavy casualties on it. After capturing Whitekuh, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Pata, a key point one kilometer south of Dam, since the 21st. The Japanese vanguard units have attacked and inflicted heavy casualties on about 400 enemy soldiers carrying mortars north of the area. The Japanese army that went south arrived at a certain place four kilometers north of Dam at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd, preparing to attack Dam, the base of the enemy's 20th Division, from the north and south. The enemy army had completely collapsed, fleeing along the Dam-Baleel Highway. The Japanese mechanized units followed and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The Japanese army, which also entered India, cooperated with the Indian National Army. Near a certain place twelve kilometers northwest of Dam, they blockaded the enemy's retreat route and launched a fierce attack, causing great confusion to the defeated enemy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 24th – The news of the Japanese army breaking into Indian territory seems to have deeply shocked and worried British and American political circles. According to a United Press dispatch from New York, the Japanese army has broken through the Indian border at three locations and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near Imphal. It also admits that the current situation has reached a critical stage. It is also heard that a unit of the Japanese army is attacking Imphal, an important base of the anti-Axis forces, and is currently only ten miles away.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 24th – The battles in the northwestern border area of ​​Burma and India are unfolding in the upper reaches of the Mogawan Creek Valley. According to news from New Delhi, the current operational objective of the Japanese and Indian armies is to occupy Manipur, an important supply base for the anti-Axis forces. If this area falls, it would be tantamount to giving the Japanese and Indian armies an important base for attacking Assam. If Japan and India further launch a political offensive against Assam, the Stilwell troops and the anti-Axis forces' eastern Indian railway in the central region will be cut off, and they are deeply worried about the development of the current situation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Cabinet Decides on Wartime Researchers <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – The Japanese Research Mobilization Conference, in order to give full play to Japan's overall war science and technology capabilities and to establish a winning system for scientific weapons warfare and production enhancement warfare, has been carefully deliberating on the wartime research topics and the selection of wartime researchers submitted by the Army, Navy Technical Institute, and the Ministry of Munitions since October of last year. All the scheduled researchers have now been decided. Among the scheduled researchers, 43 people from universities, 11 government officials, and 12 civilians, a total of 66 people, were selected as the first batch of chief wartime researchers and were officially appointed by the Cabinet on the 24th. The second batch of candidates is also planned to be announced soon.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Third Session of the Privy Council Meeting Convened in Burma <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The Burmese government convened the third session of the Privy Council meeting starting on the 20th. First, government representatives explained the 14 policy measures implemented by the government and the important plans for the future since the second session convened last year. Among them, the most noteworthy of the recent measures and plans is the strengthening of the county administrative structure and the establishment of the Planning Institute. The whole of Burma, except for the two counties of Western County, etc., consists of thirty-four counties, and the grades of each county are divided into three grades, namely, fifteen counties of the first grade, fifteen counties of the second grade, and four counties of the third grade. In order to promote emergency wartime measures, the counties adjacent to the enemy areas have been designated as first-grade counties, and the other counties have been designated as second-grade or third-grade counties. In addition to setting up a governor in the first-grade counties, a deputy governor is also set up. Furthermore, the right to freely appoint and dismiss lower-level officials is given to the local districts. At the same time, in order to seek the renewal and strengthening of local administration and to carry out the war, reward methods are also established to reward county residents who cooperate in the war. Furthermore, the government will soon establish a Planning Institute directly under the Cabinet. With the assistance of Japanese advisors, it will implement the basic planning of national policies. It is expected that after the establishment of the Institute, Burma's national politics will make rapid progress, so all parties are looking forward to it with great anticipation.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Chairman Wang Cables Bose to Express Congratulations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th – The Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army in this operation and has recently broken through the Indian border and entered Indian territory. Our Chairman Wang cabled Chairman Bose to express his congratulations. The original cable is as follows: "To His Excellency Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency led the Indian National Army in cooperation with the allied Japanese army to break through the Indian border and enter your country's territory, driving out the enemy forces and achieving this glorious initiative.

<h3 id="e7">Air Combat Continues in the South Pacific; A Japanese Major Describes the Actual Situation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South, the decisive air battle on the South Pacific front is still continuing. This is a major war of attrition and also a fierce war of resupply. The naval and air battles in the waters off Bougainville Island totaled six times. Enemy ships have suffered heavy losses and a large consumption of aircraft. This has a significant impact on the enemy's resupply war. A certain major in a certain air unit of the Japanese army recently gave a talk on the actual situation of the air combat in the South Pacific. The gist of his talk was: The superiority of the air force on the front line is inherently related to the domestic aircraft production volume. However, the superiority or inferiority of the military force is not only controlled by this, but also by how to quickly replenish the force consumed in continuous decisive battles within the time limit and prepare the air force formation, which is also extremely important. This is the so-called resupply war of aircraft. The speed of preparing the air force formation has a significant impact on the war situation. Although the United States boasts of being the country with the largest aircraft production in the world, it feels greatly distressed about the long resupply route and continuous decisive battles. In particular, American aircraft are often shot down by the Axis forces, and pilots are either killed, captured, or missing, making replenishment extremely difficult. What is most noteworthy is that the quality of enemy pilots has gradually declined recently. Among the fighters, only the flight leader is capable of combat, and the rest belong to the accompaniment, and many are not familiar with driving methods. After our fighter planes launched a surprise attack on the enemy's formation, the enemy aircraft groups fled in droves. They were almost unable to act alone, and the enemy's tactics were not worth a glance. The enemy aircraft only accompanied the flight leader's aircraft and had no practical combat ability on their own.</p>

The vacancy of the Vice Minister of Finance has been decided to be filled by Mr. Matsukuma Hideo, Director of the Tax Bureau. The government announced the appointment on the 24th.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Overview of the German-Soviet Spring Front <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Since the vast wilderness of the Soviet European part is hidden by the territory, every year around April, the frozen earth cracks, the spring water melts the snow, and the ground becomes a sea of mud. This is the so-called "General Mud," which is about to arrive. Therefore, the third German-Soviet winter war has reached the final stage.</p>
<p>Since last July, the German army has adopted a strategy of shortening the front line in response to the Red Army's successive counter-offensives. The front line has been gradually shifting westward, and it is now in a state of offensive and defensive warfare, resembling the state after one month of the start of the war. The current front line starts from Narva in northeastern Estonia and extends south to the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula. The entire line is undulating and stretches for 2,300 kilometers. Driven by the war situation, it can be roughly divided into the central-northern and southern front lines:</p>
<h3 id="e10">Central and Northern Front Lines <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>In the past two and a half years, the Soviet Union's second largest metropolis, Leningrad, whose status is second only to Moscow, has been continuously threatened by artillery bombardment as the German army's forward positions are connected to the south of the city. The Red Army has repeatedly surrounded and broken through the enemy's positions, repeatedly disappearing in defeat. However, since last summer, when the battles on the southern front line became fierce and the German army on the northern road under the jurisdiction of Field Marshal Küchler moved part of its forces and had no time to take care of it, the Red Army took the opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive in mid-January of this year from Oranienbaum (30 kilometers west of Leningrad) through the southern suburbs of the city along Lake Ilmen.</p>
<p>This Red Army, including the Leningrad Front Army led by General Govorov and the Volkhov Front Army led by General Meretskov, numbered 〇〇0,000, with national winter equipment. The main force of Govorov's army advanced along the Gulf of Finland towards Estonia, while Meretskov attempted to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Pskov. The newly formed 2nd Baltic Front Army (Commander-in-Chief General Popov) also echoed the previous two armies, starting from the southern part of Lake Ilmen and launching an offensive in the Novorzhev region (west of Velikiye Luki) on the southwest side, launching a three-pronged attack on the German army of the Küchler.</p>
<p>In the past month or so, Govorov's Red Army has crossed the Estonian border and reached the outskirts of the key town of Narva, but has encountered staunch resistance from the German army, and the two sides are still in a stalemate. The central Red Army of Meretskov captured Novgorod on the north side of Lake Ilmen and advanced to the Leningrad-Pskov railway, advancing towards Pskov from the north. At the same time, the Red Army of Popov sent its right-wing troops from the Dno area and moved towards Pskov, while attempting to break into Latvia with its left-wing troops.</p>
<p>According to this, the focus of the northern front line is on the two cities of Narva and Pskov. Narva is the northern gateway to Estonia, and Pskov is its southern gate and a key point connecting the main railway line to Latvia. The Red Army's attempt to recapture Estonia and Latvia along the Baltic coast is very obvious. Assuming that this move is partially realized, it is militarily painless for Germany, but it falls into the German army's guiding tactics, and it will take efforts in vain. From a political point of view, there are also very few places where Estonia and Latvia can be used. At this time, Field Marshal Küchler has received reinforcements of new troops and has deployed strong positions on the north and south sides of Lake Chudskoye (Lake Peipus). On the one hand, the volunteer armies of Estonia and Latvia are also participating in the defense war. It can be seen that the Red Army's supply line is extended, and there is a situation of striking down.</p>
<p>The central front line, which starts from the Nevel district, passes through Velikiye Luki, Loknya, and west of Mozyr, with Belarus as the stage, is also engaged in fierce fighting, corresponding to the northern front line. The defending army is the German Central Army under the command of Field Marshal Kluge, and the attacking army is the Belarusian Front Red Army under General Rokossovsky and the Baltic Front Army under General Bagramyan. The battlefield starts from the famous Pripyat marshes and is full of rivers and swamps. After these swamps freeze, they constitute favorable positions for the German army.</p>
<p>Bagramyan's army has been launching offensives in the Nevel and Velikiye Luki areas since November of last year, but it is still in a state of halt. At the same time, Rokossovsky's army also advanced westward from Gomel and entered and exited the Mozyr area, but could not break further west. Therefore, it turned its vanguard and started from Rogachev in the upper reaches of the Dnieper River in late February. The area is on the highway in the eastern part of the former Polish territory and can also pass through the city of Bobruisk to reach the Belarusian capital Minsk. Rokossovsky's army's attempt to enter Minsk and even the former Polish territory is obvious, but the future is still vague. In addition, with the arrival of spring, the melting snow and wading through the swamps will cause great difficulties. No matter what, the main axis of the central front line is none other than the so-called "Napoleon Road" from Orsha to Minsk, which is also the main trunk line connecting Moscow and Central Europe. Roughly speaking, as long as this trunk line is in the hands of the German army, the base of the German army will not be shaken for a day (to be continued).

<h3 id="e11">Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry Talks About Company Registration Procedures; Matters Needing Attention When Applying for Establishment or Capital Increase <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th – The Ministry of Industry has found that cases of companies applying for establishment or capital increase registration are often delayed due to non-compliance with procedures and document exchanges. In order to make the merchants and people understand the various procedures, a person in charge of the Ministry of Industry made the following remarks: Company establishment registration is a certificate for the establishment of a company. If the registered matters are changed after the establishment of the company, and the registration of the change is not made, it cannot be used to oppose the relationship of third parties, which is very important. The most common applications for registration are the establishment registration and the capital increase change registration of a limited company. Now, the registration procedures for these items are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Procedures to be completed before establishment: Those who establish a joint-stock limited company should first prepare a business plan, the names and experiences of the promoters, and the number of shares subscribed. Send it together with the prospectus, signed by all the promoters, and submit it to the competent authority for record (Article 23 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law). If the shares of a joint-stock limited company are fully subscribed by the promoters, the directors should immediately apply to the competent authority to send personnel to verify the capital after taking office (Article 91 of the Company Law). (B) Procedures for establishment registration: The establishment registration should be made by all directors and supervisors, preparing a letter of application, together with two copies of each document to be submitted, and submitting it to the competent official for review and transfer to the Ministry for approval. When the application is submitted by an agent, a power of attorney should be added (Articles 3 and 28 of the Company Registration Rules). The documents to be submitted for establishment registration are as follows: (Article 29 of the same Rules) (A) If the shares are fully subscribed by the promoters, the company's articles of association, list of shareholders, list of directors and supervisors, capital verification certificate, business outline, and documents approved for record. (B) Those who have raised the full amount, the company's articles of association, shareholder register, investigation report of the supervisor or inspector, and its attached documents, resolutions of the founding meeting, business outline, and documents approved for record. (C) Matters needing attention for establishment registration: Companies in the real estate enterprise industry, etc., from January 22 of this year, except for special needs and those that have no speculative nature and are specially permitted to be established, are all suspended from new establishment. Companies engaged in financial, match, or pharmaceutical factory businesses should add the following documents when applying for establishment registration: a copy of the financial industry's business license from the Ministry of Finance, a copy of the proof document of the match industry joining the China National Match Production and Sales Joint Venture Corporation, and a copy of the pharmaceutical factory industry's license certificate from the Department of Health. (B) Capital increase change registration. (A) Procedures and documents to be submitted for capital increase change registration: The capital increase change registration should be made by all directors and supervisors, preparing a letter of application, together with the revised articles of association, and submitting it to the Ministry for review and approval (Articles 3, 28, and 31 of the Company Registration Rules). (B) Matters needing attention for company capital increase: The Ministry announced and implemented the Interim Measures for Restricting Company Capital Increase Registration on December 16 of last year. All companies that apply for capital increase registration after the implementation of these measures, except for those that have convened a shareholders' meeting and collected share payments before the implementation and have submitted proof documents, may be handled with flexibility, and should be subject to the restrictions of these measures. The main points are extracted as follows: Companies should first state the reasons for the capital increase and the method of subscribing to shares, and submit them to the competent authority for transfer to the Ministry for approval. Companies that have not been approved for registration and issued a license may not increase capital. Companies may not increase capital twice within one year (this one year is calculated from the date of implementation of these measures). Companies may not use the increased value of goods and raw materials as shares. Companies established for more than two years may use the increased value of houses, land, machinery, and productive assets used in business as shares. However, the increased value shall not exceed one time the original price, and proof documents of the original price, verification documents of the certified public accountant, balance sheets of previous years, and business reports shall be submitted together for approval. Companies may not use methods such as gifts and rewards as shares to increase capital.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Garrison in China: One Week of Battle Situation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Press Department of the Japanese Garrison in China announced the weekly battle situation on the 24th as follows: On the 18th, at dawn, Japanese Air Force squadrons conducted four airstrikes on the enemy airfield in Hengyang, causing fires at two of its auxiliary facilities and a major explosion at one, with all squadrons returning safely to base. Due to continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft, enemy air force activity has gradually become less aggressive. However, considering the number of enemy aircraft on the mainland and the enemy's call for a general counter-offensive, they are still not to be underestimated. Furthermore, the Japanese Army recently conducted mopping-up operations against the communist forces in the Hebei-Shandong border region, capturing 250 prisoners and seizing a large quantity of weapons and ammunition.</p>

<h3 id="e18">German-Hungarian Military Cooperation to Defend the Carpathians – Hungarian Policy Inherits the Will of Former Leader <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: A German foreign ministry spokesman stated that the policy of the new Hungarian government is to implement the will of the late leader of the Hungarian National Party, Gömbös. Gömbös advocated German-Hungarian cooperation, but his social revitalization plan was often misinterpreted by later generations. The new Hungarian government will now implement it according to its original plan. The new Hungarian Prime Minister, Sztójay, was once sent to Berlin by Gömbös to serve as a liaison between the Hungarian and German governments. As for foreign reports that German troops have effectively occupied Hungary, that is completely inappropriate. The arrival of German troops in Hungary is no different from the arrival of American troops in Britain. The timely arrival of American troops in Britain to participate in the European war is similar to the timely arrival of German troops in Hungary. If the protection of the Carpathians is not strengthened, the Eastern Front will not be able to proceed.</p>
<p>Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) – Hungarian newspapers have expressed unanimous satisfaction with the recent developments in Hungary, believing that it will enable Hungary and Germany to unify their efforts in jointly defending Europe.</p>

<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The pressure exerted by the Soviet army on the Crimean Peninsula from the north to the east has weakened. The enemy seems to have been temporarily forced to abandon its new offensive in that area, but judging from their various actions, fierce battles are likely to erupt again. There is less activity in the lower reaches of the Bug River. People in Berlin believe that this is because the Soviet army has transferred troops from that area to fight in the area between the middle reaches of the Bug River and the Dniester River. The Soviet army is exerting strong pressure on the south, and its goal is obviously to break through the German positions in the lower reaches of the Bug River with a flanking maneuver. There are fierce battles in the areas of Ochakiv and Sarata, both of which are located on the west bank of the Dniester River. There are also fierce battles north of Mogilev and in the area of Potash. The Soviet army launched eight attacks, which were repelled by our troops after fierce close combat. The German army launched a successful counterattack west of Hmelnitsky, and the enemy continued to reinforce their troops to join the battle. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the area of Tarnopol and Volochysk. The German army successfully defended Brody and repelled the counterattacking Soviet army.</p>

<p>Xuzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) – The economic adjustment of Huaihai Province has been progressing gradually since the abolition of the newly issued Lianyin coupons on March 1. It is now heard that starting next month, the public utilities of Huaihai Province, such as electricity, telecommunications, telephone, railway, and broadcasting, will be managed by Central China. The North China Transportation Company has decided to hand over the section of the Jinpu Railway between Sipu and Bengbu (excluding Xuzhou) to the Central China Railway Company for management due to this economic adjustment in the Huaihai area. In addition, the Central China Railway Company has decided to move its office to Xuzhou and move the Pukou Management Bureau to Bengbu. At the same time, the Xuzhou Broadcasting Station and other transportation businesses in North China will be managed by Central China.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Citizens Should Bear the Responsibility of Improving the Lives of Wartime Police <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Feng</p>
<p>Maintaining law and order and protecting the people are the responsibilities of the police, and also the demands of the people. Shanghai is a major commercial port with a population of five million, both Chinese and foreigners, under the scrutiny of all. Whether law and order can be maintained and whether the police can fulfill their duties is not only a matter of domestic affairs, but also related to international perception. However, if we demand good law and order and that the police fulfill their duties, then we should pay more attention to the current living problems of the police and try to solve them.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the income of the police is at most a little over 1,000 yuan per month per person. It is not even enough to maintain personal life with this meager income, let alone support a family. Humans must have reason and empathy. For every current event, they should conduct multi-faceted analysis and research, like the arguments in various aspects of society. They are all dissatisfied with the service spirit of the police, but they do not carefully study the major causes of the degradation of the spirit. This kind of argument is worthless, and the result will not only not help, but will only worsen things.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities of a police station in one district initiated a police consumer cooperative with 40 million yuan. No matter how much this organization and this amount of funding can help improve the lives of more than 10,000 police officers, its intention is undoubtedly to solve the living problems of police officers and improve the spirit of service. Then, every citizen should not shirk their responsibility and do their best to support it, truly reaching the point of contributing money if they have money, and contributing effort if they have effort. Here, we hope that enlightened leaders from all sectors of society and the wealthy will compare their own lives with the lives of police officers, analyze the relationship between the future of their careers and local law and order, recognize the environment, broaden their horizons, and fully exert their sympathy. Do not make one's own body and career the target of public criticism. At the same time, we also have the following suggestions to contribute to the organizers of the cooperative:</p>
<p>The cooperative should include police officers from the entire city, not just one district.</p>
<p>The operating capital should be expanded to 100 million yuan. The police authorities should invite the financial community to organize a syndicate to provide low-interest loans, and request the Central Reserve Bank to approve half of it for discounting, using the purchase of goods as collateral, and the district office should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing repayment.</p>
<p>Requests should be made to the control agency to regularly allocate various daily necessities and should be given the convenience of procurement.</p>
<p>In addition, we also have a request to the Municipal Standing Committee. Since the implementation of the special consumption tax and the rising prices, the city's financial revenue has naturally increased a lot. What exactly is the total amount of the current municipal financial revenue? How is it being used? All taxpayers have the responsibility and obligation to understand. We advocate that finances should be absolutely open, and the use should be reviewed by taxpayer representatives. The establishment of a public opinion organization is not something that can be done immediately, but at least the municipal authorities should invite people from all walks of life and municipal experts to first organize a municipal financial expenditure review committee to deal with this issue. Perhaps some unnecessary expenses can be saved to help further improve the treatment of the police. This is the fundamental way to improve the service spirit of the police and rectify police discipline.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Detailed Measures for Temporary Cloth Rationing Announced: Cloth Purchase Certificates to be Distributed Regionally Starting April 10th <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce held a reception for the press at the International Hotel yesterday (the 25th) at 3:00 PM. More than 20 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers attended. Chairman Tang of the Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of Yu Langxi, reported on the Chamber's recent preparations for temporary cotton cloth rationing, strengthening the unified cotton control mechanism, ending the purchase of yarn and cloth, and preparing for the members' representative meeting. At the same time, reporters inquired in detail about the permanent yarn and cloth rationing plan and the problem of preventing malpractices by retailers receiving cotton cloth, which the Chamber of Commerce answered one by one. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e34">Handling Temporary Cloth Rationing <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>It has been six months since the Chamber of Commerce was ordered to purchase yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area. The cotton cloth market in the city has been stagnant for a long time. The Chamber of Commerce is aware that the general public's need for cotton cloth is quite urgent, and has decided on a method of centralized allocation of cotton products. Before the implementation, the Chamber of Commerce will first handle a temporary rationing of cotton cloth in the city. The outside world has very high expectations for this temporary cotton cloth distribution work, and the Chamber of Commerce is also making its greatest efforts for this matter. I will now explain the relevant matters separately below, so that everyone can be informed.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Things to Know Before Buying Cloth <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality will distribute "Cloth Purchase Certificates" printed by the Chamber of Commerce to the citizens within the control line according to the total population, one certificate per person. Each cloth purchase certificate is marked with the number of a cotton cloth retailer. The certificate holder must buy from the designated merchant. Each certificate is limited to buying one zhang five chi (approximately 5 meters) of cotton cloth. The type and color can be chosen from the various cotton cloths distributed and sold by the retailer. The prices of various cotton cloths sold by retailers will be determined and announced by the Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the standard price approved by the Executive Yuan. Citizens should surrender the "Cloth Purchase Certificate" when buying cotton cloth, which will be collected and canceled by the merchant, and should obtain an invoice, which they must carry with them for passage. The "Cloth Purchase Certificate" is valid for six months from the date of issue. The "Cloth Purchase Certificate" must not be damaged or altered. If lost, it will not be reissued.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Cotton Cloth Prices <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Calculated at double the original purchase price, plus a wholesale profit of 10% and a retail profit of 20%. For example, the original purchase price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 3.75 yuan per chi. Doubling it is 7.5 yuan, plus a wholesale and retail profit of 30%, it costs 9.75 yuan per chi. At that time, a detailed price list of various fabrics will be widely announced so that everyone knows.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Retail Store Numbers <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 700 cotton cloth retailers in the city. The Cloth Store Guild divides them into four grades: A, B, C, and D, according to the merchant's usual business volume. Each A-grade merchant can receive more than 6,000 cloth purchase certificates. Each B-grade merchant can receive 4,000 cloth purchase certificates. Each C-grade merchant can receive 2,000 cloth purchase certificates. Several D-grade merchants can jointly receive 2,000 cloth purchase certificates. The numbers of the retailers are arranged in order by route. In addition to the Cloth Store Guild preparing retail store number signs and distributing them to the retailers to be posted in conspicuous places on the facade, a list of retail store numbers, names, and addresses will be compiled and distributed and announced once printed.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Cloth Purchase Certificates <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The cloth purchase certificates for this temporary cotton cloth rationing are modeled after the rice purchase certificates and are currently being printed urgently. After printing, they will first be sent to the retailers who are to receive the distribution to be numbered and stamped, and then sent to the Chamber of Commerce for collection and then transferred to the Municipal Government for distribution in accordance with the rice ticket method. It is expected that they will be distributed regionally starting next month on the 10th. However, in order to prevent malpractices, it must be solemnly stated. The cotton cloth for this temporary distribution is the loose cloth currently stored in each retailer. Not only are there many varieties, but also in order to ensure that every citizen can receive satisfactory cloth, the Chamber of Commerce stipulates that retailers should display samples of the distributed cloth for selection, but only while supplies last.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Permanent Cotton Cloth Rationing Problem <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Finally, a reporter asked: Regarding the permanent cotton yarn and cloth rationing problem, it is said that: The Chamber of Commerce is giving it serious consideration according to Article 12 of the centralized allocation method of cotton products approved by the Executive Yuan. In the future, the Cotton Control Committee will be responsible for handling it, because its allocation task is complicated, it must be implemented after proper planning, so that malpractices will not occur during implementation. Then they discussed and studied how to prevent the retail merchants who receive the temporary distribution of cotton cloth from selling cotton cloth fraudulently. It is planned to note the color and date of the cloth on the back of the purchase certificate after each citizen has purchased the cotton cloth from the designated retailer, so that the Chamber of Commerce can verify it.</p>

<p>The New Life Movement Association of this city, based on its position of assisting air defense social services, has specially collaborated with the Air Defense Headquarters to produce two types of paper air raid lampshades, which are inexpensive and convenient to use, and will not affect work during peacetime. The Mayor has approved that starting from the Capital Relocation Anniversary Day (the 30th of this month), the Association will mobilize young people to hold charity sales and conduct air defense propaganda, so as to arouse public awareness of participation in the war. There are two types of styles, A and B. The charity price of each A-type is 23 yuan, and the price of each B-type is 18 yuan. The prices are printed on the lampshades. Letters have been sent to relevant agencies for assistance.</p>

<p>Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Federation of Industry and Commerce, China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, News Federation and other four organizations are giving a grand farewell tea party at 4 pm yesterday (25th) at the Xingya Building on the Bund Industrial and Commercial Federation Hall because Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China has been in office for more than a year and has made great contributions to the promotion of cooperation between China and Japan and the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. People from all walks of life in Shanghai and Japan actively participated in the event. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e51">List of Attendees <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The guests of honor included Minister Tajiri, Matsudaira, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, Akahoshi, representative of the Japanese Army, Sakazume, representative of the Fleet News Department, Kawasaki of the Domei News Agency, Wen Guanting, Chairman of the Civil Welfare Association, Funatsu, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, and Yuan Shu, the Chairman of the News Federation. The allies included President Takashima. Aoki Section. Osaka and City. Washio Isoichi. Ichihashi Hikoji. Hidaka Qingmosasa, etc., from the Chinese side included Zhao Jinqing. Ren Xiaoshan. Wang Haibo. Chen Shaoai. Chen Riping. Xu Xiaochu. Gu Nanqun. Xiang Kangyuan. Shen Siliang. Xu Guanqun. Jin Zongcheng. Zhou Mengbai. Lei Xianzhe. Song Zhuozai. Liu Yunfang. Chen Binhe. Yan Jiabao.

After all the guests were seated, Chairman Wen Lanshi gave a speech on behalf of the chairman, followed by a thank-you speech by Minister Tajiri. Finally, a speech was given by Tatsichiro Funatsu, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The mood was enthusiastic, and the tea party lasted for two hours before everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wen Guanting's speech is as follows: Your Excellency Minister Tajiri, Distinguished Guests, Today, the Civil Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the News Federation, and the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association are holding a grand tea party to bid farewell to Minister Tajiri, who is being promoted to an important position. I am honored to deliver a speech on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri has been in China for more than a year and has achieved remarkable political achievements. He has devoted much effort to the Greater East Asia Construction and the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, especially in various aspects of Shanghai, and has always been respected by all walks of life. He has provided much practical assistance to the establishment and development of our associations, which is unforgettable for our colleagues. Now that Minister Tajiri is about to leave Shanghai, we sincerely hope that Minister Tajiri will not forget us even when he is far away, and will continue to guide us with his past enthusiasm. I believe that Minister Tajiri will definitely agree to this.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish Minister Tajiri good health and look forward to your continued guidance as a farewell message.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Tajiri's Speech <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>I am very happy to be invited to this grand event today, and I am also grateful for the Chairman's presentation. I have been in office for more than a year. During this period, the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly fierce. Regarding the outcome of the war in the Pacific, some of you may have doubts. However, I believe that the gains and losses of islands in the Pacific will not have a decisive impact on the overall war situation. The defenses of the Japanese military in the Pacific are very thorough and solid. In the near future, you will all receive very pleasant news.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the mainland front, the Indian National Army has risen up to cooperate with the Japanese army and has crossed the Sino-Indian border and entered its homeland. This is very exciting news. The liberation of India is also the liberation of Greater East Asia. I believe that the 300 million people of India will unite to fight for the liberation of their homeland, achieve independence, and from this, the liberation of all East Asian nations can be achieved at the same time.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War, from the standpoint of Shanghai, is a war to liberate Shanghai and a war to build a new Shanghai. The cooperation that Japan gives to Shanghai is to build a new Shanghai, not to replace the British and Americans. Since the return of the concessions, the highest institutions established by the British and Americans in the past, such as the board of directors, have been abolished. This proves that Japan is cooperating in building a new Shanghai and is completely different from the British and American treatment of Shanghai.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, Japan has used all its active forces to assist Shanghai's leading economic figures, such as the organization of the Commercial Control Association, and has done many things. From a cultural point of view, in the past year, it has promoted Chinese culture. In order to build a new Shanghai, a new China, and a new East Asia, its practical ideas are being promoted day by day.</p>
<p>In the past year, everyone has worked very hard to build a new Shanghai. Although I feel my strength is weak, I have asked myself to do my best to assist. Looking back at the achievements of the past year, although all parties have worked hard, I am still not satisfied. What is the reason? I think the main reason is the oppression of the war, the oppression of the Greater East Asia War. Although this will continue in the future, if you can continue to work hard, I believe that the construction of a new Shanghai will definitely be successful.</p>
<p>The oppression of the war is increasing and will become more intense in the future. This is a pessimistic factor. However, there are also optimistic factors that can dispel pessimistic factors. In recent months, we have seen three optimistic factors:</p>
<p>First, the political factor. Every country should have a clean government, and so should China. If it can be popularized throughout the country from top to bottom, it will definitely have good results. Without my explanation, you all understand that there has recently been a tendency for clean government in Chinese politics. This is the first optimistic factor.</p>
<p>Second, the economic factor. The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years, and China has participated in the war for more than a year. Now is wartime, and the wartime economic situation is not completely free. Since it is wartime, it is not allowed to have no wartime emotions. Now people in China and Japan have gradually understood this meaning. This is the second optimistic factor.</p>
<p>Third, the implementation steps of Japan's new policy towards China. In the past, there were also inconsistencies on the Japanese side, especially regarding the concept of Japan's new policy towards China. The inability of China and Japan to agree on this was most regrettable. Now, whether it is in terms of concepts or implementation steps, they are gradually becoming consistent. This is the third optimistic factor.</p>
<p>If these three optimistic conditions can be utilized well and developed, then the construction of a new Shanghai and a new China will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Recalling President Sun's legacy, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and he earnestly advocated the abolition of unequal treaties, which is also an external revolution. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, China's external revolution has been completed. However, the domestic revolution has not yet been completed. It is especially important that during this Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people bear the responsibility of building a greater Shanghai and a new China, which is a daunting task. Japan also hopes that you will complete this important mission under the leadership of the national government and work harder, and that the Japanese residents in China will also cooperate with China. Finally, I hope that the relationship between China and Japan will become closer and express my infinite gratitude for the grand invitation.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Funatsu's Speech <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated: Although Minister Tajiri has been in office for more than a year, it is not a long time, but during this period, the East Asia Institute was abolished and the Greater East Asia Ministry was established. The minister happened to be the first minister to take office in Shanghai at this time. At the same time, Japan's new policy towards China also began to be implemented at this time. Therefore, during the minister's term of office, the responsibility was particularly difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Trade Associations Assist in Suppressing Prices The Authorities Are Drafting Reward and Punishment Measures <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that since the formal establishment of the various trade associations in the city, they have mostly been engaged in the struggle for rights, and have rarely cooperated in the implementation of the government's wartime economic policies, which is not appropriate. In order to promote the understanding of the mission that each trade association should bear and to effectively suppress prices, the government has, in accordance with the public, provisional regulations and the resolution of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's price suppression conference, ordered its affiliated Food and Economic Bureaus to negotiate and draft assistance measures for suppressing prices and rewards and punishments by a certain date. After receiving the order, the two bureaus are now actively working on consultations. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e56">China Industrial Association Established Yesterday <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The China Industrial Association held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 25th) on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. In addition to the presence of Chen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Jiang, Vice Minister, Zuo Xuan, and Mai Jingming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, there were also Lin Kanghou, Wen Guanting, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Deqin, Zhang Dasu, Ma Runfang, Zhou Mengbai, Le Fenglin, Shi Menglong, and others from the Chinese side. From the allied Japanese side, there were Lieutenant Colonel Kumagai, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Department, Aoki Section, Director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and hundreds of others.

Then, Kumagai, Director of the Allied Liaison Department, Aoki, Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, and Zhou Mengbai, representing Tang, Director of the Commercial Control Association, delivered speeches one after another.

<h3 id="e57">North-South Grocery Industry Requests Adjustment of Selling Prices <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North-South Grocery Industry Association applied for price adjustments yesterday (the 25th). Representatives of the industry, Wang Buxin and Song Zhuozai, went to the First District Public Office to petition. That evening, they hosted members of the local press, and made a statement explaining the reasons for their application. Industry representatives Wang Buxin, Zhu Zhuozai, Yu Rupin, Li Jinzhang, Xu Boliang, and others attended. Their remarks were as follows: At a time when prices must be suppressed, our association has suddenly requested an adjustment of selling prices. At first glance, this may seem unusual, but in reality, our association has no choice but to do so. There are more than 500 North-South goods stores in Shanghai. They mainly rely on retail sales with small profits. The source of goods is wholesale from large households. The price of goods is determined by the large households, without invoices or proof. The retail prices were announced by the Economic Office of the First District last year in January and February, which are several times different from the current selling prices. If they are not sold according to the official prices, they will be punished everywhere. If they are not sold at a small profit on top of the wholesale price, there is no way to maintain their capital. This is the common pain of all retailers at present. As a last resort, we urge the competent authorities to re-adjust the selling prices and announce the prices that should be increased or decreased so that we can follow them. In the future, our industry will strictly implement the following two points: We will never purchase goods from non-industry members, strictly implement self-discipline, and put an end to hoarding goods by industry members. We will do our best to understand the authorities' intention to suppress prices. We would rather be responsible for a shortage of goods in the market than sell goods at prices exceeding the official prices.</p>

It is also heard that the committee believes that the impact of the stock market on industrial and commercial enterprises and the financial market is extremely significant. If there is any speculative short selling, it is making every effort to prevent it.</p>

<h3 id="e60">East Asian League Plan Problems after the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Kanghu</p>
<p>After the First World War, US President Wilson proposed the League of Nations plan. Was his intention not also good? Unfortunately, it only had principles and no provisions, only an abstract outline and no concrete measures. Even more unfortunately, it was not fully prepared after extensive discussion. As a result, when the war ended, this great term was exploited by ambitious British and French figures. Although the organization was subsequently realized, it was exclusively controlled by the victors, equivalent to an instrument of imperialism for partitioning weak nations. It could be predicted from the beginning that it would be nominal and end without substance.</p>
<p>Now, the year of final decision is approaching for the Second World War. Although no one can determine when it will end or how it will end, the war must end eventually. It is difficult to guarantee that it will not end unexpectedly, quickly, and suddenly. Leaving the European situation aside for the moment, regarding the aftermath of East Asia, although there has been propaganda about the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the new order and the East Asian League, no practical plan has been proposed to date. Some say that it is too early to talk about it today. Little do they know that the occurrence of the Second World War was precisely due to the inappropriate disposal of the aftermath of the Tenth World War. The inappropriate disposal of the aftermath of the First World War was due to the lack of extensive discussion and full preparation for the League of Nations before the war ended. Therefore, learning from the mistakes of the past, shouldn’t we first deploy and plan the structure of the East Asian League? If the war ends one day and we are caught unprepared, mistakes made in haste will leave endless worries. How can we not be afraid?</p>
<p>The name East Asian League is righteous and grand, and its purpose is simple. Its four principles, namely political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication, are also comprehensive and meticulous, encompassing everything. What urgently needs discussion now is the form and method of the organization. I have previously provided many opinions and criticisms on the League of Nations. Now, I intend to refer to old drafts and draft a new plan separately. I will first publish a few key points as the beginning of the East Asian League plan and as a prerequisite for the aftermath of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The East Asian League (hereinafter referred to as the League) is jointly organized by the existing countries in East Asia as units.</p>
<p>The countries in the League, such as China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, India, Burma, and the Philippines, are independent states. Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo, and New Guinea are autonomous territories. Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Vietnam are still subject to adjustment. All their political systems will remain the same, but those who voluntarily reform will be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>Special ethnic groups in the League countries should be recognized for their right to self-government.</p>
<p>The League should designate a region in the central zone to organize and establish itself as permanently neutral.</p>
<p>The League should be divided into two chambers, the upper chamber representing countries and ethnic groups, with each country or ethnic group represented by one person. The lower chamber represents the population, with approximately one representative elected for every ten million people. The ten hundred million people of East Asia should have approximately one hundred representatives, with the ratio determined by the size of each ethnic group's population.</p>
<p>In addition to deliberating on political affairs, the upper chamber should also establish an administrative committee, which is organized by mutual election of the upper chamber representatives. The speaker of the upper chamber also serves as the chairman of the administrative committee. In addition to deliberating on political affairs, the lower chamber should also establish a judicial committee, which is organized by mutual election of the lower chamber representatives. The speaker of the lower chamber also serves as the chairman of the judicial committee.</p>
<p>Each of the two chambers should form international military police agencies for common defense and security and for the forceful execution of judgments, and be directly under the command of the League.</p>
<p>Representatives of both chambers should maintain their original nationalities, but the personnel of the administrative and judicial committees and the international military police agencies must renounce their original nationalities and adopt the neutral nationality of the League.</p>
<p>The League designates Chinese, Japanese, and Indian as the common languages and scripts. All documents must be listed in all three, and all speeches must be translated into all three.</p>
<p>The League specially manufactures a common currency and stipulates the exchange rates of each country's currency.</p>
<p>Postal services, telecommunications, travel permits, tariffs, etc. between the countries of the League must be unified.</p>
<p>The League is open year-round, and its representatives are re-appointed once every three years. The upper chamber representatives are appointed by the governments of each country and the leaders of each ethnic group, and the lower chamber representatives are freely and publicly elected by each ethnic group. The speakers of both chambers each serve a term of one year and may be re-elected, with a limit of three years.</p>

<p>— Written by Toyota Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sky and Sea Wide (2)</p>
<p>In any case, the biggest festive day in the life at Etajima. One could say it was this day. Amidst the incessant playing of music by the military band, that grand dining hall was opened. That vast student dining hall still couldn't accommodate so many people. School officials and the fathers and brothers of graduates all participated in the banquet. But not a single person related to [Commander] Makoto came.</p>
<p>"Cadet Tani, you can have a drink today!"</p>
<p>"Ah, thank you very much."</p>
<p>Makoto reached his chopsticks into the dishes of red rice and grilled copper bream, joyfully picking up his sake cup. During their studies, drinking was strictly forbidden in the student hall, but only at the graduation ceremony were sake and beer allowed. However, the taste of the sake reaching his lips was not as delicious as that of a forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>"Instructor S, thank you for your guidance."</p>
<p>Instructor S, who had given him guidance from the beginning, was the one Makoto most respected.</p>
<p>The dining hall was filled with cheers and was very lively, but there was always a hint of haste. The graduates did not have the luxury of returning home or quietly awaiting employment. After this celebratory banquet, they would board training ships and sail out to the vast ocean. The warships Yakumo and Iwate were waiting for them in the Inland Sea near Etajima. Graduation and service were held on the same day, with no room for delay. This was also a subtle aspect of the Navy's arrangements.</p>
<p>After leaving the dining hall, Makoto bid farewell to all the instructors, starting with the school principal, as well as Mrs. S, the hostess of the club.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Tani-kun, — this is just a small token, —" Mrs. S said, handing him a colored piece of paper.</p>
<p>"Well then, I wish you good health."</p>
<p>"Good health — don't forget to write."</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to the lowerclassmen was the hardest.</p>
<p>The training ship's launch had already arrived at the pier, and the students were loading their belongings onto it. The cadets, holding their white-gloved hands, saluted and continued to board the ship. Handshakes at departure, cheers, farewells.</p>
<p>Makoto was assigned to board the Iwate warship. Immediately after boarding, the "Prepare to Depart" trumpet sounded. The ship was also weighing anchor.</p>
<p>Today's handshake and conversation,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, separated by waters and clouds, —</p>
<p>The farewell song was sung from the departing launch. It was the tune of "Auld Lang Syne." The cadets lined up on the ship's railing, half-dreaming, half-awake, saluting. Soon, the women wiping their tears with handkerchiefs could also be seen. The launch that had brought them to the school near the Tsukumo coast performed a "salute," conducting a final farewell, —.</p>
<h3 id="e62">New Public Charity Hall Receives Further Donation of Two Million Yuan; Good Samaritan Volunteers to Donate Half <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Last spring, this newspaper reported to the public about the difficult and pressing situation of the New Public Charity Hall. At that time, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society, hundreds of thousands of yuan were collected, which made it possible to maintain life. Recently, rice prices have risen sharply. This newspaper was informed yesterday by Mr. Lu Yinggeng that the newspaper has already raised three million [yuan], which is somewhat comforting, but there is still a shortfall of two million [yuan]. Moreover, a Good Samaritan has volunteered to donate half of the amount, to encourage the readers of this newspaper. According to the matron of the hall, the rice ration has not been received since August of last year. The entire hall requires five dan of grain per day, and sixty dan of rice per month. At the current price, this will amount to 300,000 [yuan], at least 500,000 yuan per month. By June, three [months'] worth will be needed. According to this budget, storing half a year's worth of food will be necessary to safely get through the provision of food for 900 people. Today, the hall is open for visits. The address is on Guohuo Road in the South City, and there are departments for infants, orphans, the disabled, and the elderly, which will be introduced in succession. Starting today, the business department of this newspaper will collect donations on behalf of the hall.</p>

<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>The accumulation of garbage in Yongyu Lane on the former Rue Chapsal, now J'An Road, is causing a foul and unbearable stench. The tenants have already written to the Health Bureau and the landlord, Xie Jinji, to find a way to clear it, but it has been many days, and the trend is that the entire lane will be filled and increase day by day. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this to emphasize hygiene.</p>
<p>◎ Lecture: At 3:00 PM today, the Foguang Sanatorium, located at 123 Route Massenet, will invite Mr. Sun Deyu, a expert in national studies, to give a lecture on "Fundamentals of National Studies." All are welcome to attend.</p>
