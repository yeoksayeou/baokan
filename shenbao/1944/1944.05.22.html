<h3>勝利生活</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>昨暖應上消特別市節約協會一之請，作廣　講演，以「勝利生活」爲題，略抒所見。茲以請詞發表如次。幸讀者垂奩。</p>
<p>最近有自東京來客，談及盟邦日本國內戰時生活，日趨嚴肅的實况，很足我們效法·　如：</p>
<p>火車巳經廢除頭等，取消餐車及臥車，雖高級官吏如大臣大將，與老百姓同樣生二等或三等車。長途旅行，必須過夜者，亦</p>
<p>行减食，儘量少吃，雖粒米不致糟場，更無殘飯狼籍之事。酒類均予配給，嗜酒原爲日人很普遍的習慣，但現已減少飲量</p>
<p>晚間除工廠工人行走外，市民很少無事走動，到了十點鐘，市民均熄燈就癢，翌展黎明即起，從事工作，澈底做到早眠早起的優良　慣。</p>
<p>不特日本國內，厲行戰的嚴肅生活，就在本市虹口方面，日本的高等酒館亦已停　。日本政府於本年三月一日起，實施「決戰非常措置要綱」，就有「停止高級享樂」的規定。其內容爲高級應館全部停業，書　藝妓全部停業，咖啡酒吧全部停業。同時，對於停業者採取援助措置，或減免租稅，或視其性之所近，使之就業於時局上必要之方面，或必要時得支給生活援助金·這種事實，可以充分說明，日本認爲戰時生活應有的改革，而改革方法卽經決定，則立即切賞的實戰，澈底的做到，決不因循，決不敷衍。這種生活，可以說是「勝利生活」</p>
<p>反　我們的都市生活現象怎樣？僅就「一高級享樂一一點而言舞塲則戰歌截舞；菜館則高朋滿座；旅店則電炬通宵。雀戰和局，當作家常便飯。宛如人生之樂，唯在於此；人生目的，唯擊於此·實則醉生夢死，於此已極。</p>
<p>說到節約，就在平時，也是應該遵守的美德，況際此戰時，更是天經義的義務。節約的反面是浪費，上面這些生活現象就是浪費的極則，就是節約的經敵，提倡節約，就非先消滅浪費不可。目前市民中達多數薪水階級的生活，早已節至無可再接，黨然不是我們希望節約的對象。我們希望節約的對象，就是過著上面所述的浪費生活者，這般人大多數是追求暴利主義者，因爲這求暴利僥倖得計，感覺　來頗易於是用之亦易，流於浪費，但求滿足享樂。所以，一切浪費生活的現象，都是暴利主義者所造成，要提倡節約，實現戰時生活，就須先消滅暴利主我們建議當局幾件事：義者。</p>
<p>柴館酒席，每桌超過四五千元者，超過之數，加重捐稅，以資限制。</p>
<p>不要以爲有了錢，而可以自由享受，自由浪費。不無不以。以完爲成事戰件争紬爭細勝小必可自以完馬利生活始；完成勝利生活，必自結東浪費生活始。</p>

<p>陳孝強氏答記者問　南京　中央社電電記者昨往訪警衛第三師師長陳孝强將軍，就日軍在洛陽方面作戰等，叩　一切。承答大意爲西北方面素爲中共與渝承交開之地區，此次日軍斷然向洛陽進擊，對渝共之打　至爲重大。常茲大東亞戰爭決戰陪段，我國如期與盟邦幷肩作戰，整軍實爲當前之急務，武裝同志更應　然來歸云云。</p>

<h3>雲南渝軍　渡河作戰眞相</h3>
<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>這幾天來，重慶的雲南遠征羣過蕯爾溫河的沿島農　　了全世界的人士。尤以重慶當局本身，動員無綫電於柑紙大事宣傳，而反軸心陣綫亦恰如大旱之復甘　，意出望外。可是軸心方面　特別是日本，震　獲警的　　，但那完全是另外一種意義，即爲了他們的愚蠢而震　。　　遠征軍以少數的部隊，渡過大豳傾土內的河流，何以要這探警動全世界呢，試研究那　　的理由：</p>
<p>第一，在過去八年的戰爭中，渝軍渡河而逃的事情，倒常　見說超，至波河進攻，則可說絕無使有。道在渝軍正是警夭動地的大事，使大家看到，本國軍隊現在也有這種本領了。外國通信員也拍警屬屈說：「這是表示中國作戰的決心還繼績着。」</p>
<p>第二，與納甸北部富康地建策萊杜公路的美渝聯合軍，相距僅百呱之道。那地關上直綫路程百哩的數字，使重慶產生了一種幻想，以爲從此打開最所希望的陸路國際交通綫，將爲輕而易舉的一件事。還是抹殺了地理的條件　而使民家耽於其幻想，並想滕進反軸心陣綫。正如舊金山的廣擂中所指：「這百　實是協約軍未之前過的全世界最困難的地形。地國上的直錢路程雖袛百哩，但　際上的行程　須　越許多一萬幾千呎的喜馬拉耶山高峯，　涉許多溪谷，其行程何止數百呱或數千哩。渝軍能够排隊日軍的抵抗，而成就橫斷許多山脈的　難事業、這大約要算是一個奇蹟吧。</p>
<p>第三　這渡河作戰據說是基於開羅會談的决定。羅斯福·邱士吉爾及蔣介石三互頭，如果在開羅時起就預期此次的渡河作戰，那麼，他們也會料到日軍及印度國民軍的進繫印度，伊姆法爾的包團殲淢戰，河南平原上湯恩伯軍的潰減。這三巨頭不都是聽明人嗎？日軍進擊印度時反釉心方面的新開通信，責備店　　局税，渝軍從雲南的呼應作戰，經過了多少日子還是不發動，攻　政府的機關報——大公報也歇斯的里地大醉着「雲南遠征軍在斡些什麼？」這難道也是與開羅會談有關的嗎？每當發生一件　樣的事，便說這與某次會談有關，著是英美的慣技。且此次渡河作戰，美國方面早巳要求分居其功，說這是駐渝美空軍，美工兵隊及軍　不惜協力，及渝軍美　化的結果所造成的。要之，此次渡河作戰的企圍：</p>
<p>一，乃是爲了掩飾河南載綫敗績的行動；</p>
<p>二，乃是基於外援不繼，重慶不能訪延殘喘之迫切要求的行動。</p>
<p>這二點是很容易看出的。正如重慶軍事當局所稱：「河南與雲南兩個戰塲，距離雖達，但是互相關聯的。」所以此次作戰的企圍，宣傳的效果更甚於實際的效果。舊假使爲了作戰的効果，就應該在日軍進攻印度時發動且　河的部隊袛有數千，不必宣博」二萬大軍。』而　使外國通信員至前綫，參謀長發表談話，這些都可以看出其用意何在。河南的敗繢，完全暴露了重慶的實力，而從反軸心陣綫投過來不信與實　之聲，重慶也很明白，要恢復名譽，不能不幹一下。這就是此次「渡河作戰好戲」的眞相。日本方面報稱：「渝軍的渡過怒江，全讓　破，目前正在繼績掃蕩中。」重麼和英美大的鄭重其事，反使日本爲之警呆。總之，此次的戰役，不過是一　不値一　但引人發笑的好戲而已。</p>
<h3>東京昭南間鐵路綫由議論入實踐階段</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日機械化　防協會參事淸野謙太郎氏，會於二十日會見本社記者，就日內地與南方佔領地之鐵路交通問題談稱：若僅建設四五百公里新鐵路時，東京昭南間之鐵路即可完全述結。其大意謂，更京昭南間鐵路連結案，巳逾議論時期而入於實現　段，若就此案細加檢討，其實施絕非難事。現昭南般谷間巳有鐵路開通連結，盤谷與安常間目下業巳開通盤谷閑朗並間。盤谷寫勞間兩鐵路綫。此外東浦寨亦已完成約三百公里之鐵路，其終點孟喀伯來與泰國鐵道終點之距離僅六十公里，該路前當泰圍安南紛爭時，泰軍會人安南建設約三十公里知鐵路，故所餘者倲三十公里。白因沂西　間之　定綫約爲二百公里，此若能予以連結，則河內昭南間即可取得速絡。此外另一路綫即日空肯至湄公河流城那頌巴農之預定棧，及自那孔巴農對面安南之塔開產至縱貫棧塔那浦之預定綫，此兩棧爲二百公里與百六十公里左右，此兩經如能速結，即可無須綫行，亦可接績至河內。自河内純由朗遜至中國龍州，已有鐵路之敷設，自此至　甯後，有百公里左右粵　綫支綫通至桂林，因渝方亦多少實行延長，故其　點與南寗間之距　尚不滿百公里，如行打迪，此百公里則可直接運桔至東京及北京，並可通達上海。得能窗施此計劃者，人力物力費源以及技術方而，產有日本是賴。</p>

<h3>日海軍發祥地　南伊豫巡禮</h3>
<p>— 米山保</p>
<p>八幡船時代養成的車越的航海法和戰鬥法，在之錄·慶長兩役前後運綿七年的外征中，發揮無遣，伊豫水軍常為遠征海軍的中堅，每樹殊勳。讓樣，被尊爲日本海軍之詛的伊豫水軍，其精練的戰法遂成為三島流水軍法或伊豫流水軍法，更經江戶時代兵法者的砥礪，終由東鄉艦隊高級參謀秋山眞之將軍（伊豫出身）應用於日木海海戰，大破俄國遠征軍而享盛名。最近長崎丸觸習沉沒時切腹以殉的管源三郎船長，也是伊豫人，此可說是表明伊豫水軍傳統的烈烈海軍魂的實證。</p>
<p>日製黑船</p>
<p>故於明治二十二年的宇和島第七代藩主伊達宗紀，享壽百齡，以春山的雅號而有名於世，是一個頗具新知識的人。第八代藩主宗城也是名主，由養父宗紀的支持，雖是小藩，卻敢揭出勤皇的大義。在這兩位英主的庇護及前原功山的大才之下，日本最初的黑船（註四）是在宇和島上建造起來了</p>
<p>嘉藏（後改名功山）是一個用小船載貨在各村販賣的商人之子，生於入幡濱市。嘗役於大阪，二十五歲時店主營業失敗，乃返宇和島，以製作提燈，紙鳶，雛人形（註五）等糊口，過着貧窮的生活。但深在卻悄悄研讀物理化學等書籍，或將壤了的酒改成好酒。附近的人稱他的工作爲：「發明的乞丐」。在這期間，他將來獨創完成建造黑船的偉業卻已葫芽了。</p>
<p>安政元年，宗紀宗城二公認爲確立國防，伸展國力端在制　海上，所以立志由日本人獨自的力量建造蒸汽船，於是命令以「發明狂」聞名當地的嘉廠研究燃火而馳的火輪車。經過了千辛萬苦的努力，他終於造成了一　模型，是一個橫一尺長二尺五寸許高約七八寸的箱子，兩端裝車輪四個，中軸轉動時，每轉一次車輪轉三此，四輪非獨能夠前進，並且也可後退。宗城公於是大喜，命他從速製作機關，未幾，由日本人之手造成的日本第一艘蒸汽船進水的日期到了，那是安政元年三月二日。藩主等許多人都賴參觀嘉藏的作品，甲板上擠滿了人，簡直沒有立錐的餘地。因爲過分擁擠的緣故，船的吃水也意外地深，兩側所裝的推進器（划水輪）由於水的抵抗力在預定以上，所以行駛極緩，而且走了約二町（二百餘公尺）機關即吿停止。這當然是很大的失敗。</p>
<p>宗城對他天才的科學精神所期頗深，當即派他和當時正在字利島的大村益次郎同往長崎留學。埋受苦攻以後，再歸字和島，着手建造蒸汽船。這期間，維新的大業已成，改元明治。和新日本的出發同時，他舉行了心血結晶的蒸汽船的下水禮。這時大告成功，他的船駛畢豐後水道。這時日本人自己造成的黑船的第一次進水，第一次航海。嘉藏於是因公索得武士身份，並得前原喜市及姓名，且標名靑史；由此亦可窺知宗城公的喜悅了。</p>
<p>大村益次郎與功山一同在長崎修業後，携手同返宇和島，和功山並肩建造蒸汽船，作成日本是初的軍艦雛型。這對上自伊豫水軍的古代以至向海洋進軍頗多因　的伊豫，也是值得記錄的事情。功山於廢藩置縣侯即行歸農，在宇和島市野川度其殘年，死於明治廿五年，享年八十二歲。他會製造步槍，發明日本最初的雷管，並創利用水車的紡織機和縫紉機。多才多藝的他且博士而成「槍人形」，成爲當地的鄉土藝術，流傳　很廣。這就是浸提宇和島名物首人形的鼻祖。總之，在明治維新前後即爲建設設科學日本而吐萬丈氣焰的前原功山，其不朽的功績是今日應該加以顯揚的。</p>
<p>註四：　日本昔稱歐美各國的船艦爲黑船，因其船身皆漆成黑色之故。</p>

<h3>Victory Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>Yesterday, upon the invitation of the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, I delivered a speech titled "Victory Life," briefly expressing my views. Here is the text of the speech, for the reader's perusal.</p>
<p>Recently, a guest from Tokyo spoke of the increasingly austere wartime life within Japan, an ally, which is highly worthy of our emulation. For example:</p>
<p>First-class train carriages have been abolished, and dining cars and sleeping cars have been eliminated. Even high-ranking officials, such as ministers and generals, travel in second- or third-class carriages like ordinary people. For long-distance travel requiring overnight stays, food rations are reduced, and people eat as little as possible, ensuring that not a single grain of rice is wasted, and there are no messy leftovers. Alcoholic beverages are rationed. Although drinking was a widespread habit among the Japanese, consumption has now decreased.</p>
<p>In the evenings, aside from factory workers on the move, few citizens are seen wandering about aimlessly. By ten o'clock, most citizens have turned off their lights and gone to bed, rising at dawn to engage in work, thoroughly practicing the excellent habit of early to bed and early to rise.</p>
<p>Not only within Japan is an austere wartime life rigorously enforced, but also in the Hongkou district of Shanghai, high-end Japanese bars have been closed. The Japanese government, starting from March 1st of this year, implemented the "Essential Guidelines for Decisive Battle Emergency Measures," which included provisions for "stopping high-end entertainment." The contents included the complete closure of high-end restaurants, the complete closure of brothels and geisha houses, and the complete closure of coffee shops and bars. At the same time, assistance measures were taken for those who were shut down, such as reducing or exempting taxes, or, depending on their skills, employing them in areas necessary for the current situation, or providing living assistance funds when necessary. These facts fully illustrate that Japan recognizes the necessary reforms in wartime life, and once the reform methods are decided, they are immediately and earnestly implemented, thoroughly carried out, never procrastinating, and never going through the motions. This kind of life can be called "Victory Life."</p>
<p>On the other hand, what is the phenomenon of our urban life? Focusing solely on "high-end entertainment," dance halls are filled with dancing to the rhythm of war songs; restaurants are packed with esteemed guests; hotels are brightly lit throughout the night. Mahjong games and gambling are commonplace. It seems that the joy of life lies only in this, and the purpose of life is only achieved in this. In reality, this is the epitome of a life of dissipation and decadence.</p>
<p>Speaking of thrift, it is a virtue that should be observed even in peacetime, let alone during wartime, when it is a divinely ordained duty. The opposite of thrift is waste. The lifestyle phenomena mentioned above are the extremes of waste, the enemies of thrift. To promote thrift, we must first eliminate waste. Currently, the lives of the majority of salaried people in the city are already frugal to the point of being unsustainable, and they are certainly not the target of our call for thrift. The target of our call for thrift is those who lead the wasteful lives described above. Most of these people are pursuing profiteering, and because they have succeeded in their opportunistic pursuit of profit, they feel that it comes easily, and therefore spend it easily, indulging in waste, seeking only to satisfy their pleasures. Therefore, all phenomena of wasteful living are caused by profiteers. To promote thrift and realize wartime life, we must first eliminate profiteering. We suggest several things to the authorities:</p>
<p>For banquets in restaurants where each table exceeds four or five thousand yuan, the excess should be subject to heavier taxes to limit them.</p>
<p>Do not think that having money allows you to enjoy freely and waste freely. Not at all. Only by completing the task of thrift can we achieve a victory life; and completing a victory life begins with ending a wasteful life.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Cleverly Operates in Burma, Enemy Counterattacks Heavily Damaged; Annihilation Battle on the West Bank of the Nu River Still in Progress</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The second counteroffensive operation by the enemy's 26th Division and the West African 81st Division in the Buthidaung area was met with a clever operation by the Japanese army. Attacking from four directions, the Japanese army has, in just two days, driven the enemy's 10th Brigade of the 26th Division to the area east of Letwedaung. The enemy's 9th Brigade of the West African 81st Division is currently disintegrating near Taung Bazar. On the 18th, the Japanese army cut off the enemy's main force's retreat at three points and is expanding its gains. The Japanese army has also occupied the high ground north of the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road junction, cooperating with the Japanese forces occupying Hill 143 to crush the enemy's attempt to open the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road. At 9 PM on the 16th, the Japanese army completely occupied the Mayu mountain range and the enemy's important stronghold, Hill 1301, and is further planning to occupy the northern high ground, forming an encirclement around the enemy's main force. Furthermore, the enemy's 9th Brigade of the West African 81st Division, which is stirring on the left bank of the Mayu River, has now had its air supply cut off and is facing preemptive attacks by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces on the Kohima-Ukhrul road, in response to the counteroffensive launched north of Kohima, have been stubbornly counterattacking for a month from the road and the Imphal River, Chindwin River, and Manipur River. The elite units of the Japanese army north of Imphal are holding the high ground at 512, 5417, 4955, Kanglatongbi, Koupruim, and Donzai, destroying the enemy's attempt to escape and allowing reinforcements to participate in the second attack. Now that all preparations are complete, the Japanese army, using its elite troops, took the opportunity to seize Hills 5704 and 619 and commenced a fierce assault along the Ukhrul road on the 20th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news received here, the Southeast Asia Command believes that the British and Indian troops on the Manipur front are under severe threat from the Japanese army and has urgently dispatched aircraft to transfer the British and Indian 5th Infantry Division from the Arakan front to reinforce Manipur.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in Palel, waiting for the 31st Brigade to come to their aid from Tengnoupal, are continuing their desperate resistance, but they are being subjected to intense shelling by the Japanese army, and their combat strength is declining daily.</p>
<p>Outnumbered on the West Bank of the Nu River</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since late April, the morale of the Chinese troops advancing on the west bank of the Nu River has been extremely low, and they are also very anxious because the rainy season is approaching. They have therefore launched frequent and stubborn counterattacks, with a force of about six or seven divisions, which is quite powerful in terms of numbers. In response, the Japanese army, in addition to inflicting annihilation blows east of the Gaoligong Mountain road, has also cut off the retreat route of the Yunnan Army in the Dulong River area, using the tactic of luring the enemy in deep to defeat them individually. Furthermore, in the Lengshui area, they annihilated two large units of the Chinese army. Other Japanese army units have also defeated the Chinese troops attacking the Pingmanqian front, 100 kilometers southeast of Yingjiang.</p>
<p>Subhas Chandra Bose Determined to Fight to the End for the Liberation of the Motherland</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - As the general offensive on Imphal is about to enter its final stage, Subhas Chandra Bose, the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, has also personally gone to the front to supervise the battle. This battle is undoubtedly the final reckoning for Bose's twenty years of fighting for liberation. Shouldering the great mission of liberating 400 million citizens, this reporter had the honor of meeting with Bose at a front-line encampment. He shares the hardships of the soldiers, sleeping only three hours a day. His face shows a determined expression, filled with confidence in victory. Besides discussing offensive operation plans with his generals and officers, he often encourages the morale of the National Army and comforts the wounded and sick soldiers. Here are the questions asked by the reporter to Bose: "Chairman, since leaving Calcutta on January 26, 1941, you are now personally leading the National Army on the road home. What are your feelings?" He replied, "I do not fear any obstruction from Britain. Four years ago, when I left India, the British authorities offered a reward of one million rupees, but they ultimately failed to capture me. Today, the British have built strong fortresses along the Indian border to prevent the Japanese army from advancing and me from returning home, but fate has been decided. The imperialist forces of Britain are powerless to stop our righteous army from advancing." Question: "Gandhi has now been released. It is said that when you and Gandhi parted ways in 1939, he invited you to a separate room and said that if you (referring to Bose) succeeded in your armed struggle, he would be the first to send a telegram of congratulations. Is this true?" He replied, "Gandhi's release is a performance. If he hears the news of my return home, he will celebrate with us. Therefore, the timing of his congratulatory telegram will be after I return to Calcutta, when the people of India truly recognize the Provisional Government. I hold a lofty and consistent belief, persevering in my fight for freedom for many years, only knowing to fight for India's independence until the goal is achieved."</p>

<h3>Chongqing-Communist Line Conference Seems to Have Reached a Compromise</h3>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency) - The Xi'an talks on the Chongqing-Communist Party's reorganization negotiations, which began on the 5th of this month, seem to have reached a compromise by the 16th. Communist Party representative Lin Zuhan arrived in Chongqing on the 17th, and Chongqing representative Wang Shijie returned to Chongqing on the 18th. According to Chongqing news received here, Zhang Zhizhong, the political director of the Military Affairs Commission, a right-wing figure within Chongqing, also participated in the Xi'an talks, which is noteworthy. The content of the Chongqing-Communist Party conference is unknown, as both the Nationalists and the Communists are prohibited from making announcements, but local sources speculate that the topics discussed were: Reorganizing the Chongqing government to allow Communist Party members to participate in the Chongqing government; Agreements on Communist Party military and base areas; Aid to Communist Party military forces; Recognition of the special status of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; and the cessation of attacks on the Chongqing army by the Communist Party. In short, this conference is not the final compromise between Chongqing and the Communist Party, but only a temporary reconciliation. It is believed that considerable time is still needed to reach a final decision. Furthermore, the objective conditions for holding this conference were: Unifying the national war front; Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have criticized Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship as an anti-democratic act and have expressed goodwill towards the Communist Party's democracy. Moreover, the situation within the country is such that, due to the loss of Henan in the recent operation, Chongqing is in a precarious situation both internally and externally. Therefore, if the Communist Party's Xi'an talks can achieve a compromise, it will bring temporary relief to Chongqing's predicament.</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoqiang Answers Reporter's Questions</p>

British and American forces repeatedly launched flanking attacks to cut off the German retreat, but were repelled after fierce fighting. The German forces withdrew in good order, taking all of their heavy weapons and hundreds of prisoners to new positions in the mountains behind. Before withdrawing, the German forces completely mined the entire area and built numerous obstacles, so the American forces encountered great difficulties in pursuing the retreating German forces. The German forces also thoroughly destroyed all important military facilities and port equipment in Geeta before withdrawing.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Yunnan Army's Crossing of the River in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Hermit of Jiangnan</p>
<p>In recent days, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force's crossing of the Salween River has agitated the nerves of people around the world. In particular, the Chongqing authorities themselves have mobilized the radio to publicize it greatly, and the anti-Axis front has also felt unexpected relief, like a sweet rain after a long drought. However, the Axis side, especially Japan, was shocked and alarmed, but that was for a completely different reason, namely, shock at their own stupidity.</p>
<p>Why should the crossing of the river by the Chongqing army's small units cause such a global stir? Let us examine the reasons:</p>
<p>First, in the past eight years of war, it was more common to hear of the Chongqing army crossing rivers to flee than to attack. There has been almost no instance of an offensive across a river. Therefore, for the Chongqing army, this is indeed a sensational event, allowing everyone to see that their own army now also has this ability. Foreign correspondents also exaggeratedly said, "This shows that China's determination to fight is still continuing."</p>
<p>Second, the American-Chinese Allied forces building the Ledo Road in northern Burma are only a hundred miles away. That figure of a hundred miles on the map gives Chongqing a kind of illusion, thinking that it will be easy to open the most desired land international transportation line. They have glossed over the geographical conditions and allowed the people to indulge in their fantasies, hoping to advance the anti-Axis front. As pointed out in a broadcast from San Francisco, "These hundred miles are actually the most difficult terrain in the world that the Allied forces have never crossed before. Although the straight-line distance on the map is only a hundred miles, the actual journey requires crossing many peaks of the Himalayas that are more than ten thousand feet high and traversing many valleys, and the journey is no less than several hundred or several thousand miles. For the Chongqing army to be able to overcome the resistance of the Japanese army and accomplish the arduous task of crossing many mountains would be a miracle."</p>
<p>Third, this river-crossing operation is said to be based on the decision of the Cairo Conference. If Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek had anticipated this river-crossing operation in Cairo, then they would also have foreseen the Japanese army's and the Indian National Army's advance into India, the annihilation battle in Imphal, and the collapse of Tang Enbo's army on the Henan Plain. Are these three giants not all intelligent people? When the Japanese army attacked India, the news dispatches on the anti-Axis side blamed the Chongqing authorities for not launching a corresponding operation from Yunnan after so many days, and the Chongqing government's official newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, hysterically cried out, "What is the Yunnan Expeditionary Force doing?" Is this also related to the Cairo Conference? Every time something like this happens, they say that it is related to a certain conference, which is a common trick of the British and Americans. Moreover, the American side has already demanded to share the credit for this river-crossing operation, saying that it was achieved thanks to the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the US engineering corps, and the Americanization of the Chongqing army. In short, the purpose of this river-crossing operation:</p>
<p>One, is to cover up the defeat on the Henan front;</p>
<p>Two, is based on the urgent need for Chongqing to prolong its existence due to the lack of foreign aid.</p>
<p>These two points are easy to see. As the Chongqing military authorities said, "Although the Henan and Yunnan battlefields are far apart, they are interconnected." Therefore, the propaganda effect of this operation is greater than the actual effect. If it were for the effect of the operation, it should have been launched when the Japanese army attacked India. And the number of troops crossing the river is only a few thousand, there is no need to publicize "20,000 troops." The fact that foreign correspondents were sent to the front line and the chief of staff gave a speech shows the intention behind it. The defeat in Henan completely exposed Chongqing's strength, and Chongqing also understands the voices of disbelief and doubt coming from the anti-Axis front. To restore its reputation, it has to do something. This is the truth about this "good show of crossing the river." The Japanese side reported, "The Chongqing army's crossing of the Nu River was completely crushed and is currently being mopped up." Chongqing and the British and Americans are making such a big fuss, which makes the Japanese side dumbfounded. In short, this battle is just a good show that is not worth a dime but makes people laugh.</p>
<h3>From Discussion to Practice: Railway Line Between Tokyo and Singapore</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st – Central News Agency: Mr. Kiyono Kentaro, Advisor to the Japan Mechanization Defense Association, stated in a meeting with our reporter on the 20th regarding the railway transportation issue between Japan's mainland and the occupied southern territories: If only 400 to 500 kilometers of new railway were constructed, the railway between Tokyo and Singapore could be completely connected. In essence, the plan to connect the Tokyo-Singapore railway has moved beyond the discussion phase and entered the implementation phase. Upon closer examination, its execution is not difficult. Currently, the railway between Singapore and Bangkok is open and connected. The section between Bangkok and Aranyaprathet is also open, along with the two railway lines between Bangkok and Siem Reap. Furthermore, the railway from Dong Phu Xai has been completed for approximately 300 kilometers, with its terminus, Meng Kaborei, only 60 kilometers from the terminus of the Thai railway. During the previous conflict between Thailand and Vietnam, the Thai army constructed about 30 kilometers of railway in Vietnam. Therefore, only 30 kilometers remain. The designated route between Vientiane and the Yixi area is approximately 200 kilometers. If this can be connected, quick access between Hanoi and Singapore can be achieved. Additionally, another route includes the planned line from Nong Khai to Nakhon Phanom in the Mekong River basin, and from Thakhek in front of Nakhon Phanom in Vietnam to the planned north-south line of Tanap. These two lines are approximately 200 kilometers and 160 kilometers, respectively. If these two routes can be quickly connected, the preliminary line can be bypassed, and connection to Hanoi can be achieved. From Hanoi, a railway already extends purely from Lang Son to Longzhou in China. From there to Nanning, there's about 100 kilometers of a branch line of the Guangdong-Guangxi line to Guilin. Since the Chongqing side has also implemented some extension, the distance between its endpoint and Nanning is less than 100 kilometers. If this 100 kilometers is completed, goods can be directly transported to Tokyo and Beijing, and access to Shanghai is also possible. Japan is the only one who can implement this plan regarding manpower, resources, expenses, and technology.</p>

<h3>Citizens Stockpiling Daily Necessities: Mandatory Registration and Reporting to Ascertain Stock Levels and Plan for Increased Production</h3>
<p>The Economic Division of the First District Public Office of this city, to understand the existing stock levels of materials in this city, is conducting a registration of daily necessities. Items such as matches, candles, laundry soap, and coal are all essential for people's livelihoods. However, due to electricity limitations and material source issues, their production volume is not as abundant as before. In order to calculate existing quantities so as to plan for increased production or unclog supply sources, this registration of the above-mentioned materials is being carried out. Regardless of whether citizens are stockpiling for personal use or merchants are using them for trade, all must follow the amount regulations stipulated by the office, honestly filling in reports on the designated dates. Citizens should cooperate with the authorities and not evade the registration. If anyone conceals information in an attempt to avoid registration, once verified, the Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau will be responsible for confiscating the goods. Citizens are urged not to be wait-and-see, so as not to violate regulations. Furthermore, citizens and merchants are urged not to engage in excessive stockpiling or hoarding behavior. Also, the office has made it clear that this inventory registration has absolutely no intention of compulsory purchase. Citizens should pay attention to this announcement.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Business and Industry Registration</p>
<p>The City Economic Bureau issued a circular to all trade associations in the city, instructing their members to apply for business and industry registration at the Second Section of the bureau before the 31st of this month. Failure to comply will result in expulsion from the association and a fine of up to 1,000 yuan. If registration is further delayed, business suspension will be imposed as punishment. Various industrial and commercial firms are flocking to the bureau to register, and the registration process is very enthusiastic. Once the city-wide business and industry registration is completed, a comprehensive statistical analysis will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Cotton Cloth in Nanshi: Preparations Completed, Application Forms Issued, and Cloth Purchase Certificates Distributed</h3>
<p>The rationing of cotton cloth based on population count in the Nanshi district is being handled by the Nanshi District Public Office. Preparations have been largely completed since commencement. It has been decided to proceed according to the census figures from February of this year. The application form for cotton cloth rationing based on household registration will be issued by the street office chiefs (坊公所) and neighborhood heads (保甲長) to the respective households. Each registered householder is to complete the form in detail, according to the items listed on the form, in order to receive the cloth purchase certificate. Therefore, households that have moved in after February, deceased individuals, or households that have moved out but have not been reported are not allowed to complete the application form. Any false information will be severely punished according to the law upon discovery. The neighborhood heads must also bear joint responsibility to ensure thoroughness. To prevent multiple acquisitions, organizations and groups in the district that have registered as group households but are not registered internally must apply for verification from the neighborhood head in charge, based on the address listed on their residence permits. Citizens over 20 years of age and underage children without residence permits can fill out the certificate by cross-referencing the ages on the neighborhood's five-part registration form and the number of people on the household registration plate from the police bureau, ensuring that the two match. Householders are urged to pay special attention to this. In addition, the district office will ensure that all personnel involved in the completion of the application certificate, including neighborhood heads and householders, act with impartiality. They must not exploit the opportunity to deliberately create difficulties or fail to issue certificates based on accurate information. Citizens may appeal directly to the district public office during the distribution period of cloth certificates to ensure thorough investigation throughout the Nanshi district.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Terrorist Drill Throughout Nanshi</h3>

<p>One-Month Deadline for Completion</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice had previously announced the promulgation and implementation of the Amnesty Regulations and the Recidivism Prevention Regulations, and had issued a circular to all subordinate judicial organs, requiring them to complete all matters within three months of the document's arrival. However, it has been found that while many judicial organs have reported compliance within the deadline, a significant number have delayed reporting. Therefore, the ministry has issued another circular extending the deadline by one month, requiring all judicial organs to report along with the judgment orders, and no further delays will be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Naval Memorial Day Special of Japan's Allied Nations, Part 2: A Record of the Victory in the Battle of Tsushima, Introduction from the North-China Daily News, 39 Years Ago</h3>
<p>Introduction: On May 27, 1905, the day the Battle of Tsushima Strait began, the Shanghai-based North-China Daily News published the first report of the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet in the most prominent position: "Russian fleet sighted, attack commenced." Most noteworthy, the newspaper wrote: "Naval experts have always believed that it is absolutely impossible to sink steel warships with torpedoes and shells, but Japan has completely overturned this belief in this battle, actually sinking steel ships with shells, which is truly amazing." This is identical to how the Japanese Navy used aircraft to sink battleships in the Great East Asia War. The following is the newspaper's account of the battle:</p>
<p>First report of the Combined Fleet: Urgent telegram from Tokyo, May 29 – On the morning of May 27, the first report of the Combined Fleet was received:</p>
<p>"Our Combined Fleet began the attack immediately after receiving a report of the sighting of the Russian fleet. The weather was clear on that day, but the waves were quite high." Public announcement of the Battle of Tsushima: Urgent telegram from the North China Daily News correspondent in Tokyo, May 29 – The general staff headquarters announced today the outline of the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan as follows:</p>
<p>"The Japanese Imperial Navy's Combined Fleet, led by Admiral Togo, encountered the Baltic Fleet in the waters off Tsushima on the morning of May 27 and began artillery battles from the afternoon of the same day. In the fierce battle until dusk, the Japanese naval destroyer flotilla began to operate, inflicting a fatal blow to the enemy. On the 28th, the battle continued, and the Japanese Navy pursued the Russian fleet fleeing towards Korea. The Russian Navy's heavy cruiser Izumrud used its speed to flee north, but the battleship Nicholas I, the Oryol, the coastal defense ship Admiral Senyavin, and the Apraxin came to surrender. On that day, the Japanese Navy suffered minimal losses in this battle. Russian prisoners witnessed the sinking of two battleships, cruisers, and three other ships. There are currently two thousand Russian prisoners. The report stated that the Japanese Navy sank a total of thirteen Russian ships of all sizes. The Russian Navy is therefore completely unable to fight, and the aforementioned surrendered enemy ships are not included in that count. The number of prisoners has increased by one thousand."</p>
<p>Japanese government announcement (Tokyo, May 30, afternoon, second report from Admiral Togo):</p>
<p>The main force of the Japanese Combined Fleet accepted the surrender application of the Imperial Russian Fleet in the waters off Okinoshima on the afternoon of May 28 and immediately ceased pursuit. However, all enemy ships applying to surrender were arrayed southwest of the coastal defense cruiser Admiral Ushakov. The Japanese naval battleships Iwate and Yakumo advanced towards the ship and demanded that the enemy ships come under our command. The enemy ships refused, reneging on their previous statement, and were immediately bombarded. At 6 p.m., the Admiral Ushakov was sunk. About three hundred enemy officers and soldiers were rescued from the sea. Also, at 5 p.m., the Russian naval cruiser Dmitri Donskoi was fleeing northwest. It was immediately pursued, and our Second and Fourth Destroyer Squadrons bombarded it. The ship attempted to escape under the cover of darkness, but our Second Destroyer Squadron continued the relentless pursuit, and the next morning, it ran aground on a small island off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. All the crew members were taken prisoner. Also, in the evening of May 27, our destroyer Sazanami captured the Russian destroyer Bedovy off the coast of a small island south of Korea. The ship carried the commander of the Baltic Fleet, Admiral Rozhestvensky, who was severely wounded, as well as two other naval admirals. Together with about eighty officers from the Russian Navy's flagship Suvorov, which was sunk on May 27, they were all captured by our side. On the morning of May 28, a Russian destroyer sailing north was spotted and immediately bombarded and sunk. Also, our cruiser Niitaka and destroyer Murakumo pursued a Russian destroyer on the afternoon of May 28, causing it to run aground.</p>
<p>American public opinion on Japan's victory (Special telegram from the Japan News Agency in Tokyo, May 31) – The entire American population is amazed by the great victory of the Japanese Navy, praising the unprecedented attack power and bravery of the Japanese Navy. Ambassador Takahira received congratulations from all sides. Washington's observation and perception of Japan have changed completely.</p>
<p>The impact of victory: London, May 31, via Reuters from Bombay – The London stock market is very excited. Japanese stocks continue to rise, up 5% since the start of the war.</p>
<p>Due to the enthusiastic advocacy of the French newspapers, the hope of peace between Japan and Russia is further emphasized.</p>

<h3>Improving Material Control: Authorities Actively Negotiating, Resolution Expected Soon</h3>
<p>The issue of improving recent material controls and the issue of the Rice Control Committee adopting the allocation of rice to stabilize the people's food supply have received considerable attention from the general public. Government authorities have been planning improvement measures with relevant authorities in recent days regarding this significant policy and will determine the overall plan. According to reliable sources, Mr. Chen Junpu, the Minister of Industry of the National Government, came to Shanghai a few days ago and summoned Tang Shoumin, the Director General of the National Commercial Control Association, and Yuan Ludeng, the Chairman of the Rice Control Committee, to inquire in detail about the actual situation of the Commercial Control Association's material control and the key points of rice procurement and allocation. In addition to the indications of improvement regarding the Rice Control Committee's rice procurement and allocation, the reform of the Commercial Control Association's structure is still under negotiation, so a resolution can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>This City Began Stepping Up Electricity Conservation Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to promote conservation and increase the driving force of wartime production, the Shanghai area began a stepped-up electricity conservation movement yesterday (the 21st). It is hoped that general users will actively save electricity, even to the slightest degree, for non-essential electricity use, so as to save 20% compared to the actual electricity usage in April of 1933, so that it can be used in important production industries.</p>

<h3>Birthplace of the Japanese Navy: A Pilgrimage to Southern Iyo</h3>
<p>— Yoneyama Tamotsu</p>
<p>The navigation and combat techniques cultivated during the Hachiman ship era were deployed without reservation during the seven years of foreign expeditions around the Keicho and Bunroku eras. The Iyo navy was often the backbone of the expeditionary navy, achieving special merits each time. As such, the Iyo navy, revered as the progenitor of the Japanese Navy, developed its refined tactics into the Mishima-style or Iyo-style naval tactics. These tactics were further honed by strategists during the Edo period and were finally applied by General Akiyama Saneyuki (born in Iyo), a senior staff officer of the Togo Fleet, in the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, defeating the Russian expeditionary force and earning great fame. Captain Kan Gensaburo, who committed seppuku to remain with the sinking ship during the recent sinking of the Nagasaki Maru, was also from Iyo. This can be said to demonstrate the ardent naval spirit of the Iyo navy's tradition.</p>
<p>Japanese-Made Black Ship</p>
<p>The seventh lord of Uwajima in 1889, Date Muneki, who lived to be 100 years old and was known by the pseudonym Shunsan, was a person with considerable new knowledge. The eighth lord, Munenari, was also a famous lord. With the support of his adoptive father, Muneki, he dared to proclaim the great cause of loyalty to the emperor despite being a small clan. Under the patronage of these two enlightened lords and the great talent of Maebara Isamu, Japan's first black ship (Note 4) was built in Uwajima.</p>
<p>Kazo (later renamed Isamu) was the son of a merchant who loaded goods on small boats and sold them in various villages, born in Yawatahama City. He once worked in Osaka, and at the age of 25, his employer's business failed, so he returned to Uwajima, making a living by producing lanterns, kites, dolls, etc., living a poor life. But deep down, he secretly studied books on physics, chemistry, etc., or turned spoiled sake into good sake. People in the neighborhood called his work "the beggar of inventions." During this period, the great achievement of building a black ship that he would later create on his own was already budding.</p>
<p>In 1854, Lords Muneki and Munenari believed that establishing national defense and expanding national power lay in controlling the sea, so they resolved to build a steamship with the power of the Japanese alone. Therefore, they ordered Kazo, who was known locally as the "invention maniac," to research a fire-powered vehicle. After much hard work, he finally created a model, which was a box about one shaku wide, two shaku five sun long, and seven or eight sun high. Four wheels were installed on both ends, and when the central axis rotated, the wheels turned three times with each rotation. The four wheels were not only able to move forward but also backward. Lord Munenari was overjoyed and ordered him to quickly build a machine. Soon, the day arrived for the launching of Japan's first steamship made by Japanese hands. That was March 2, 1854. Many people, including the lord, relied on seeing Kazo's work, and the deck was crowded with people, with hardly any room to stand. Because it was too crowded, the ship's draft was unexpectedly deep, and the propellers (paddle wheels) installed on both sides experienced more resistance from the water than expected, so it ran very slowly, and the engine stopped after about two cho (over 200 meters). This was, of course, a great failure.</p>
<p>Lord Munenari had high expectations for his genius scientific spirit and immediately sent him to study in Nagasaki with Omura Masujiro, who was then in Kurishima. After enduring hard work, he returned to Iyo and began to build a steamship. During this period, the great cause of the Meiji Restoration had been achieved, and the era name was changed to Meiji. Coinciding with the departure of the new Japan, he held the launching ceremony of the steamship that was the crystallization of his efforts. This time it was a great success, and his ship sailed the Bungo Channel. This was the first launching and first voyage of a black ship made by the Japanese themselves. Kazo was thus granted samurai status by the public, and he received the name Isamu Maebara, which was recorded in history. From this, one can also see the joy of Lord Munenari.</p>
<p>Omura Masujiro returned to Uwajima with Isamu after studying together in Nagasaki, and they worked side by side with Isamu to build a steamship, creating the prototype of Japan's first warship. This, from the ancient Iyo navy to the advance into the ocean, is also a matter worthy of record for Iyo, which has many connections. Isamu returned to farming after the abolition of the han system and spent his remaining years in Nogawa, Uwajima City, dying in 1892 at the age of 82. He made rifles, invented Japan's first detonator, and created spinning and sewing machines using waterwheels. A man of many talents, he also became a doctor and created "gun dolls," which became a local folk art and spread widely. This is the originator of the head-shaped dolls that are synonymous with Uwajima. In short, Maebara Isamu, who had demonstrated great enthusiasm for building a scientific Japan before and after the Meiji Restoration, deserves to have his immortal achievements recognized today.</p>
<p>Note 4: Japan used to call ships from European and American countries black ships because their hulls were all painted black.</p>
