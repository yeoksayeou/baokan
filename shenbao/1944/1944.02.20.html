<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>中國不是摩納哥</h3>
<p>— 吉田祐</p>
<p>一般人常喜歡說：「蘇聯扔宗敎為鴉片，而中國認鴉片為宗敎」，但最近蘇聯甚至開放了宗敎，而中國也逐漸不以鴉片爲宗敎了。此外，一般稱爲中國劣根性的賭傳，也在新靑年中不那樣紅了。此　者，老早就被中國愛國份子視爲萬惡之首，認為毒害中華民族的手段，認為幫助異族政府中國的工具。最近三禁運動的主要目標，實際上也就在於此二者　而且參加運動的學生本身，全都是激於義憤和愛國熱情。現在止當這批靑年，企圖協助政府所發動的新國民運動，而禁絕一般人稱爲中國死症的鴉片和賭博的時候，假如他們又曉得了自已所協助的政府，業已宣佈姻窟和賭塲爲答法，且以警察保護其營業的話，那末他們的心情該怎樣？靑年學生由於這一點，靑年學生對於新國民運動，未必會更加熱悄吧·况且，惟其因爲他們是對國家民族抱具滿腔熱忱的英年血氣之士，所以很可能發生更可怕的反感。職是之故，政府對於南市賭塲，限三月底結東，對於鴉片，則發表禁姻三年計劃，這不能不設是賢明的政策！</p>
<p>現在尙未解決的問題，只是第一區內的賭塲。繼令三月底南市賭塲禁絕，然而第一區內的賭塲假如仍然照常營業，那末沉溺於南市賭塲的顧客，自然就會轉到第一區來。二禁運動，決不是爲了替第一區內的賭塲拉生意而發動的，旣是這樣，那末響應新國民運動的號召而起的靑年學生，他們的眞實竟旨，竟整個被蹂躪了。假如認爲南市的賭塲，在玻璃盒中搖骰子是不對的，而認爲第一區內的賭塲，向墙上猛力拋球就是對的，那末南市也就可以用力向墻上擲　子好了！　假如說南賭塲的壞處在於中國式，而第一區內賭塲的好處在於外國式，那末南市採用日本式賭傳好了，豈非更勝共他外國式一籌呢？總之，參加三禁運動的學生，所以憤而肅正風氣者，並不因中國人用於賭傳的工具爲硬的或軟的，其方法爲外國式或中國式，而有所轉移其深惡痛絕的感情·在南市不對者，在第一區內也不對，在南方應取締者，在第一區內也應取締。自然我不否認，假如賭塲取消，也許有陷於財政困難的機關，然而中國並不像摩納哥國一樣，賭塲門山警察隊把守，而警察隊則由賭塲的盈餘來察養。中國在世界上是屈指可數的大國，假如也校倣世界上的頭號小國摩納哥，用賭塲盈餘豢養警察，那末毌寧取消賭塲和警察更爲有利。古來就有一句諺語：「錢到賭塲，人到法塲」。賭塲盛，則宵小多，宵小多，則警察也必增加，警察增加，則經費也愈夥，於是也就不得不以賭塲來塡補財政了。然而反過來說，假如取締賭塲，那末一時偶或不便，但不久後，宵小也隨即减少，宵小减少，則警察工作，也即减少，人員也可不用。所以非用賭塲塡補不可的財政，是需要根本煎新加以檢</p>
<p>最近筆者聽說，在中國人問業已成立了一個第一區內的外國式賭傳公司。雖然是令人難以置信，但都在風傳著。正當中國靑年學生，聲嘶力竭，高唱禁賭禁姻禁舞的時期，而竟有人，投資開辦賭博公司，眞令我不敢相信。或許這也是上海許多反宣傳中的一個。</p>
<p>政府常局最近曾逮捕二百多名金條投機商人，某報社評曾要求對此輩商人，以操縱物價罪名，適用戰時刑法。正不惜任何犧牲，進行大柬亞戰爭的期間，懲罰此等敗類份子，也是理所當然。自然，人民對於當局這種斷然處置，表示滿意。然而同時，在這樣嚴重時代，還希望政府當局明示，取締助長投機賭傳風氣的賭塲之大政方針，勿因中國式或外國式而差別受理。同時要澈底追究上述反宜傳的眞相，假如設立公司與操縱股票市塲行爲有關，則望政府即以處置標金投機商人之嚴刑，處置若輩。（魯譯）</p>
<h3>日內閣局部改組　石渡任大藏大臣　首都方面表示奮與期待</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日政府爲應付當前政戰兩方面之重大局面完成强化內閣政治力，飛躍增强决戰戰力起見，决定改組內閣，幷由東條首相爲中心，銳意協議設置方策，茲巳商有結果，故東條首相乃於十九日晉宮，覲謁天皇陛下，啓奏內閣改組事宜，奏請聖裁。關於此事，日情報局於是晚九時半發表文告如次：正三位動二等石渡莊太郞任大廠大臣，宮城縣知事從三位動二等內田信也任農商大臣，正六位五島慶太任運輸通信大臣，以上三新大臣之親任典禮，業於十九日下午九時在宮中舉行。又大藏大臣賀屋興宜，農商大臣山崎達之輔，遝輸通信大臣八田嘉明呈請辭職照准，特賜前官醴遇。</p>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　日政府爲强化內閣政治力，並增强决戰總力，以適應現階段政戰兩界之重大局面，遂斷然實行改組內閣，並以現任國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎任大藏大臣，消息傳來，首都各方面莫不表示興奮，而對盟邦今後施政之新開展，尤寄予極大期待。</p>
<h3>襲拉巴爾敵機　擊落十八架</h3>
<p>拉巴爾十九日中央社電　敵機十七日來襲拉巴爾時，經日機與之交戰後，即擊落其七架，此後經日軍地上砲火擊落者，有艦上轟炸機七架戰鬥繼二架，擊毀者有艦上轟炸機二架，合計學落繫毀敵機共十八架。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，敵小型機十二架十六日晨曾來襲馬紹爾羣島米勒島，被擊落一架，日方無捐害。</p>
<p>拉巴爾十九日中央社電　敵軍對拉巴爾之空一中攻勢猛烈已極，十五，六，七三日間來襲敵機，合計達二百四十四架之多，當地日海軍機隊及陸海軍守備隊當即邀擊，所獲戰果計擊落敵機二十六架，擊毀敵機七架。</p>
<h3>敵魚雷艇　一艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>柬京十九日中央社電　據西南太平洋日軍某基地電，日軍舟艇曾於十六日於聖特蘭灣北口海面，與敵魚重艇兩艘交戰，已將其一艘擊沉，另一艘擊毀，日軍無損害。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電據南太平洋日軍某基地十九日電：日海軍機隊曾於十四日夜在波根維爾島兩岸摩比那角海上，發現敵魚雷艇四艘，當即加以轟炸，炸沉其中一艘，日機無損害。十七日上午日海軍機隊曾於馬加斯角海上，轟炸敵運輸船一艘，並於是日下午轟炸芬希哈罕敵機塲，使之起火，日方無損害。</p>
<h3>印緬邊境　日軍進展中</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　日軍於印緬國境方面之攻擊，益呈快速進　，據新德里來電，東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令部亦承認日軍之優勢，而於十七日發表如次“日軍部隊已於齊吉姆地區摩爾演附近佔領數丘陵陣地，日軍部隊已對納蓋德庫山峽東方之數處反軸心軍陣地，展開反覆攻擊。</p>
<h3>日軍作戰精神美報備加贊揚</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　美軍自吉爾貝特作戰遭受未曾有之損害後，美朝野要求美軍變更從來作戰方式之聲浪逐日高昻。紐約泰晤士報於一月十五日著論，以「達拉瓦之敎扣」爲題，指明日軍鬥志之旺與對日戰之不易，並要求變更作戰方式，其大意如次：吉爾貝特作戰之全貌雖已明瞭，然關於美軍損害綜合數字尙未發表，但已不難想像其必爲極大之數字。吾等期望美軍之犧牲，而能以新基地抵償其價値而有餘，殊不意攻繫軍之損害，竟造成前所未有之紀錄。吾等須知日軍將兵皆有不惜身命及不餘一兵之敢鬥精神，其自刎殉國之行爲，隨時均可坦然行之。吉爾貝特一役，已證明日軍視死如歸之果感氣魄，日軍在作戰必要上或有撤退時，然彼等終不悉降伏為何物，對怯懦者之增惡感特為強烈。據前述之情形，美國對日·戰之態度，自須根本加以變更。吉爾貝特作戰，可視爲通知美國前途橫有幾多困難與犧牲之　鐘，今後於太平洋更將有大規模之激戰，與眾多之犧牲，故應確切評價日本之實力云。</p>

<h3>日紅會接獲國際紅會謝狀</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　關於美國前託帝亞丸轉運救恤品救濟敵國俘虜及扣留者，美國務卿赫爾等曾作虛僞宣傳謂。此等救恤品已不知去向，日本當局並未轉蓮。其實日本紅十字會近已接得日內瓦國際紅十字會之感謝狀（二月十日發出者），故敵方之虛偽宣傳即不攻自破，完全暴露。茲錄該惑謝狀內容如次：據國際紅十字會駐日代表報吿，帝並丸所載大部救恤品，於日本紅十字會協力下，在聖誕節前均已分別送交各抑留所本會於茲，謹對日本紅十字會之協力敬致謝忱。</p>

<p>河內十大日中央社電　據當局之悄報稱，向爲重慶當局所最期待之湖南省煤炭生產量，已呈七年來未有之激減狀態。最近一月之生纏量，僅六百五十噸，因此除使湘省與內地連結之各鐵路，陷於不能運輸外，即以衡陽爲中心之各地發電所，亦均停止送電，故對軍需之補送，與民爾物資之生產上，發生大恐慌。致使物價逐漸昻騰，呈不可收拾態。</p>
<h3>港重要物資買賣限制規則</h3>
<p>香港十九日中央社電　日香港總督部，爲防止戰時下重要物資，及所管區城外走私計劃，特公布「重耍物資買賣限制規則」，指定銅鐵鋼發動機皮革船底碎鐵等之買賣成交，須預先得到總督部之許可。茲以所管區內秩序已整備，走私事項已形滅跡，故對該事無須有特殊之規則，特自二月廿日起，將上項規則廢止。總督部前於二月八日廢止織維製品搬出入取締規則，如蔴袋蘆董棉植等重要織維品，於管區內已可自由移動。茲又廢止重嬰物資成交買賣之限制，是故，今後管區內之商務悄况，可臻相當圓滑之境地也。</p>

<h3>日大使館發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　日駐華大使館當局，十九日下午三時，就淮海地區通貨之調整，發表談話如次：國府對於淮海地區通貨之調整，會於去年十二月一日起，在淮海地區使用中儲券，並以中儲券百元對聯銀十八元之比率，同時使用兩種通貨。頃又决定，自三月一日起，停止新發行聯銀券，即百三月一日以後，中國聯合準備銀行，不再發行聯銀券，一般金融機關亦停止聯銀券之新交易。又國庫金之支付，悉以中儲券行施之。但中國聯合準備銀行一般金融機關，照舊接受以前發行之聯銀券，並承認以前成立聯銀券交易繼續進行。又市內一般人仍可照常使用聯銀券。同時徐州一等郵局，及其他六所郵政局，由華北郵政總局移歸郵政總局駐滬辦事處管理。此次因淮海省之設立，該地區通貨制度之調　有新發展，同時關於調　郵政懸案，亦得解決，此在該地區之行政爾　上，為一實堪欣怏之事實。日方對於中國方面之此項措　，今後決予以萬全協助。蓋推進中儲券洗通區域之擴大，及謀該地區與華中華北間物資之圓滑交流，實有促進該地區民生安定，及經濟建設之協力方針也。</p>
<h3>淮省郵政移轉管轄</h3>
<p>謝京十九日中央社口電　蘇淮特區自奉國府明令，改寫淮海省後，該區一切有蘭政治經濟建設等機構，即逐步予以調整，迄今業已大致就緒。業郵政一項，關係交通建設至鉅，自有速予綢整之必嬰。經建部與關係方面之數度磋商，已定於三月一日，該省區前屬華北郵政總局管轄之六郵局，由郵政總局駐滬辦事處正式接管。並在徐驚設郵政總局駐滬辦事處徐州臨時分處，以謀今後業務之順利迅速。從此該省區之郵政，已吿劃一，殊堪欣慰。建設部當局昨特爲此發表談話，茲錄誌於後：蘇淮特區自塞國府明令。改為淮海省後，所有該區交通機構，亟應予以調整。關於郵政一項，業經議定調整要領，並經迭與右關機關磋商，意見業已一致、所有該省區內前隸屬於華北郵政總局管轄之五郵局，一律定於本年三月一日，移交郵政總局駐滬辦事處管理，爲期處理該項移管業務，得以圓滑及迅速起”，决定暫在徐州筹設郵政總局駐滬辦事處徐州臨時分處，茲已决定於三月一日，在各有關機關人員列席之下於徐州舉行移管議式，以示隆重，此次該區郵政業務，承盟邦當局協助策劇，得吿統一，良可　紉。</p>
<h3>波對蘇讓步　接受蘇提案　國界問題可望解決</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　傳波蘭亡命政權十七日召開緊急閣議，已决定接受蘇懸擬以卡遜綫爲蘇波國境之提案，以作暫時之協定。當將該决定要旨通吿邱吉爾，故料邱吉爾或將再與斯達林開始交涉。頃據美聯社倫敎訊，此次波蘭政府有此决定，故蘇波糾紛當可解央。</p>
<h3>芬蘭內長　自瑞京返國</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電，芬蘭內長厄爾羅多，現逗留於瑞典京城，已於十八日乘機飛返赫爾辛基。</p>
<h3>柏林注視局勢發展</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德外交界稱，英方消息謂丹麥港內之券船不准航行，毫不確實，謂與狄特爾將軍準備自分蘭北部撤退之說固屬虛妄。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社外交特派員霍恩撰稱：芬蘭問題繼續爲敵人與中立國報紙政治討論之中心，英美各報迄今仍力稱，蘇聯所能接受之唯一條件，爲芬籣之無條件投降，但同時各中立國之英美報紙與共產黨機關報則突然改變論調，而稱蘇聯將準備以中庸之道對付芬蘭。鑒於最近數星期莫斯科在外交政治範圍內之趨向，則敵陣營中此種欺騙戰術之變動，殊不足爲異，但須知芬蘭已有充分之經騐’深知蘇維埃人對於莫斯科所簽之二切條件，並不寄以多大之價値。芬關人對於蘇聯之拖飾策略，明若觀火，在此情形之下，柏林方面將一羣以往之熊度，靜候未來之發展，柏林方面深信分蘭負責之政治家與全國人民，均能不爲蘇聯各種相反之宣傳所欺，而明瞭武力爲决定之因素。</p>
<h3>楚柯夫被任　紅軍副總司令　伐吐丁將軍參謀長免職</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　據「瑞典晚報」駐莫斯科訪員息，蘇聯情報局發表文吿稱：楚柯夫上將昨被任爲蘇軍副總司令，爲總司令期達林之副。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍事方面昨稱：伐吐了將軍之參謀長伊凡諾夫，已被楚柯夫元帥免職，此訊係自蘇方在西凡尼哥洛特加區被俘之蘇參謀人員所供述者，伐吐了將軍係烏克蘭前綫之蘇軍司令。</p>
<h3>那爾瓦河西岸　展開肉搏戰　南路德軍一集團突圍</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據海通社訊：近日來那爾瓦河西岸，大砲數百門相對轟擊，查夜火光燭天，那爾瓦至奈伐爾之公路一帶現有激戰，其北面森林及冰凍地區亦被砲彈擊毀。蘇軍於排砲猛轟五小時後，得渡那爾瓦河，衡入德軍陳地，而在西岸獲得立足地。蘇軍不斷涉遇已凍河面而西進，德軍大砲阻敵由公路前進以待後援，堅守那爾瓦城東橋頭堡之德兵處境頗危，給養運輸綫有被切斷之虞，而彼等本身亦有被包圍殲滅之險·於是德·挪·丹·荷之義勇兵紛紛出動，契合成隊，以期擊退渡河西進之敵軍，德軍大砲數砲同發，致那爾瓦城屋宇爲之震動，德鐵甲車手溜彈奮勇反攻，與西進蘇軍肉搏，終將敵兵擊退，敵傷亡頗衆。當公路迤北之德重徐　展之際，德砲火阻敵即進，發砲甚準確，那爾瓦河西岸之敵軍悉被殲滅，森林與沼澤之中，蘇兵遺屍千具以上，那爾瓦河泳之上蘇兵遣屍亦到處堆積。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據海通社訊，被圍於契爾喀賽以西之德軍突圍而出，與孟斯坦元帥之主力會合一起，使蘇軍包　大隊德軍之望付籌泡影，而使東綫南路局勢大爲滅輕。過去數年來德軍採取大包圍戰策略，予敵方以嚴重之損失，此次契爾喀賽之戰，又證明其價價値蘇軍作戰之目標，在殲滅德軍大部，在德軍陣綫上造成空隙，然後長聯直入之計劃又吿失敗。此間戰局之新發展，使莫斯科　布大隊德軍被圍之消息，成爲　無根據。蘇軍進攻維特勃斯克區多次皆無成就，現已暫吿休止，僅在北路之那爾瓦區，蘇軍之進攻尙木停止，然其進攻之軍隊每難超過一營。德軍退出斯達拉雅魯　，與深人敵軍後方一帶之地，爲德軍拉直戰綫之一部份行動。</p>
<p>中路攻防戰告一段落　　柏林十九日中央社電　總國新聞社訊：東綫中路星期四並無重要之戰事，二月十七日以來之平靜，已使維特勃斯克之第二次防禦戰役吿一段落。蘇軍雖在該市鎭之東南與西北，曾出動六個軍團，共計槍兵五十三個師團，坦克車十三個旅團與强大之砲隊，但終本能完成其突破。反而損失戰俘一千人以上，坦克車三六三輛，大砲九十一尊，機關槍數百挺，以及其他步兵重武器。</p>
<p>德軍十二萬　突圍成功</p>
<p>東綫南路最重，為德軍一集團被切斷數日後，重復取得聯絡，二月四日乃紅軍宣佈德軍最大不幸之一日，三日後敵又宣稱，被保衛之德軍已緊　於四十方公里之區域內，再過四日後，該區已縮爲廿方公里，同時蘇軍自稱已包圍德重十之萬人，二月十五日紅軍承認德軍之解救攻勢已有進展，區德軍四周之蘇軍包圍圈據稱仍爲四十公里，而實際上則有十公里之闊度，二月十六日黃昏蘇軍司令部承認德坦克車在齊維尼哥洛特加之進攻巳擭勝利，並稱其包圍圈仍爲廿公里之闊度，其實被保衛之德軍編隊已於是日加入德軍坦克車集團，蘇軍雖再度突破德軍此項聯絡，但予以重大之捐失。</p>
<h3>義境安齊奧前綫　暴雨中血戰　美第五軍稍後撤</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據此間本日所獲北非反軸心總部消息“義境安　奧方面現方在暴雨之下血戰，美第五軍已不堪　軍之巨大壓力而稍稍後退，凱賽林元帥以四師之兵力，在安齊奧作戰·</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，德軍最高當局發表：德軍利用大量砲隊，賡續與納吐諾橋頭堡之敵軍激戰，因此能再縮小包圍敵軍至阿普里亞以南四公里，敵軍在坦克軍協助下展開反攻無效。至於卡西諾之美軍因實力趨弱，而由印軍瓜代，印軍全日向卡西諾諸山中　　均告屬　，德軍未反攻時即刻塡平陣地之缺口數處。卡西諾火軍站得面復失者數次，但率仍被德軍佔領。</p>
<p>寺院廢墟屍體纍纍</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　卡西諾寺院巳化爲廢墟，最後留居該院之八十三歲高儈寺院長阿瑪萊神父，巳應德軍代表之懇請，於十八日偕同僅生之司祭及修道士離開。該寺院長決定最近赴羅馬，對敎黃庇獲十二世作詳細報告。又由於此次反軸心軍之非人道攻擊，自該院廢墟中掘出修道士之屍體的百具，至其他一般人之死傷達六百人以上。</p>
<h3>阿根廷　總統辭職　由萊貝托繼任</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹十九日中曲社電　據阿根廷京城消息：阿根廷總統賴米雷茲將軍業已辭戰，萊，貝托已被委為繼任人。</p>
<h3>華維爾拒釋　印大會黨員</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　新德里來訊：印度總督　維爾對於請求開釋被禁之印度大會黨會員一事，巳加以拒絕。華維爾稱，一切有關係者若果宣言與么軕心國無條件合作，則渠方能釋放。</p>
<h3>德國的總力</h3>
<p>日本朝日新聞社，以一德國的總力」爲題材、與該社柏林及瑞士兩地特派員舉行紙上座談會，各就現地觀察，分別申述；　——繼者附誌</p>
<p>朝日新聞社我們所期待者，盟邦德國怎椦邀擊英美的歐洲攻勢。關於德國方面的强韌的兵力，生產力，及國民的必勝信念，請述其詳。</p>
<p>德國兩面作戰</p>
<p>守山特派員（柏林）如其說兵力，生產力，及國民的必勝信念綜合起來就是總和戰力，那麽，現在德國的總和戰力，從其絕對量新來，我以爲决不弱於二年前或三年前，而且兵器已經改艮。兵士巳累積了戰鬥經隊。然則德國何以停滯不進呢？那是因爲戰局在不知不覺間已變成了二面作戰的綠故。德國今腹背受蘇聯軍與大事擴充下的芙美軍之夾攻，所有築中於一面作戰的閃電戰根本思想一不能不變換到二面作戰的戰略和戰術。前年秋以來德國轉取防禦戰者，就是這轉變上不得巳的犧牲。去年八月左右起，飛機工業轉變爲遂行二面戰爭的機構已經吿終，又因去年的總動員，德國國內所有能够執搶的男子均已穿起軍裝。斯達林格勒以來德國的歷次撤退，據德方公式的說明，是因爲壓倒優勢的敵軍兵及軍器之數量。但在今日决戰下，集結了國家一切總力的德國戰力，與對方蘇聯的優劣關係如何，不在我們討論的範團內，茲引用郭培爾宜傳部長的說明，以明其關係。</p>
<p>大概英美將要　試　闢第二戰綫吧！而且敵軍兵力兵器的數量，恐比我德軍佔優勢。但海上運輸這兵站運輸的困難，抵消敵人的兵力上的優勢，其力量不過和我軍相等罷了。但我們看義大利戰綫上，處於劣勢的我軍所獲的戰果，就可以知道，如其德軍與敵的兵力相等時，其戰鬥有何種結果。所以我德國在第二讓綫中是必勝的。</p>
<p>這種立論還有可考慮的地方，就是德國覺悟用精神與戰術來補其不足，且那種覺悟愈見强烈，誠堪欣喜。</p>
<p>朝日新聞社請向中立國方面觀察現戰局的印象。</p>
<p>中立國的觀測</p>
<p>笠特派員（瑞士）　在現階段，最後决定全歐洲情勢者，如下述幾點：蘇波國境問題與眞理報的暴露英德和平說，是蘇聯向德國所投的炸彈。英蘇的裂痕，因這二事件面擴大起來。結果從莫斯科會談到德黑關會談這中間，英國愼重進行的許多工作，完全落空。蘇聯現在揭去了自已的假而具，這是因爲英國對第二戰綫表示怯懦的綠故。德國假使趁此英籌間的裂痕，對第二戰綫與以大打擊，則蘇聯與英國的均衡狀態，一擊之下，即將崩潰。這在德國是絕好的機會。所以第二戰綫反將成爲有利於德國而展開的機會。</p>
<p>然而在另一方面，東部戰綫與對德空炸，依然是値得注目的問題·就東部戰綫說，一切將由德國新銳的預備軍來决定。至於德國的被空炸，亦不應看得太嚴重，一切全視德國能否維持內政部長希姆萊氏所定的體制。空炸的目的就在崩潰希姆萊體制與削弱戰力。希姆萊體制不單昻揚德國國民的土氣！因其組織力，而在維持軍隊的土氣上。也盡了重大的任務。所以從現狀看來，這體制遠比一般所想像的來得强靭。</p>
<p>且關於食糧方面，去年農作物增收的結果，在供給上不用担心。最後，我們可以說，歐周戰爭不是一方面的戰爭，而是三方面的戰爭。即德蘇戰，德英戰與英蘇門爭。這戰爭的狀熊，一天一天明白起來。在德國方面，可以充分發揮其政策與戰爭的餘地，亦愈見開展。這是從現狀所獲的印象·（翔：譯自二月七日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>從東洋文化復興說到　中國軍事顧問輔佐官之責任　本月三日對日本軍事顧問佐管演講詞</h3>
<p>— 蕭叔宜</p>
<p>東洋文化復興　大東亞戰爭之關係</p>
<p>東洋文化巳有數千年悠久歷史，當東洋文化巳達到相當高度的時期，西洋大多歡民族選在野變時代，此為世人所公認。但數百年以來，東洋民族或閉關自守，或趨於沒落，漸漸衰弱下去，西洋民族則挾其功利主義跨海東侵，躋於强盛。巳往我們東洋民族由盛而　，西洋民族由衰而盛，現在我們東洋民族將由袞而盛，西洋民族如英美等帝國主義者也必由感而衰，這是歷史　變的定律。中日事變固為中日兩大民族的不幸，可是由此事變，日本確認中國軍隊的戰鬥精神遠勝英美，若以此堅强的戰鬥精神，益之以嚴格的敎育訓練，定可與日本共同保衛東亞。再說日本陸海空軍在大東亞戰爭中所表現的威力，所得到的大成功，為戰史上得未曾有可以判定大東亞戰爭最後勝利定屬於我們。以大東亞戰爭勝利為契機，東洋文化定可復興，東亞民族必能解放。</p>
<p>東洋文化之精髓－「仁」</p>
<p>東洋文化之精髓是「仁」，要說明仁，就不能不購到中國的理學。王陽明先生對「仁」的解說，是存天理，去人欲。一個人能念念不忘的存天理，不使一點私欲把仁的本體遮蔽，仁的本體自會顯現出來，中國儒家常說，有大仁纔有大勇，孔子曰殺身成仁，孟子曰捨生取義，都是大勇的行為。一個人為什麼能自願殺身捨身呢？因為仁與義比之身體生命更為可貴，所以說，有大仁纔會有大勇。個人是這樣，國家民族亦然，中國古訓有道句話：「師直為壯，曲為老」又曰「師出有名」，拿大東亞戰爭來講，東洋民族是被侵略，是被迫而戰，是為了爭取解放而戰，自然理直氣壯，師出有名，英美是侵略者，是為了侵略其他民族以滿足其欲望而戰，師出無名，所以理曲氣弱，由仁勇來說，我們是必勝，英美是必敗</p>
<p>仁的表現是「誠」</p>
<p>仁是心的本體，所以人性是本善的，故孟子日性善。但是意之發動處或為外物所誘惑，或為私意所蔽，便有不善。我們能把私欲去凈，使心的木體　然無滓，就不會大不善的意思發出來，　呌做誠意。所以仁的表現是「誠」。</p>
<p>「誠一的功用很大，我可以舉出幾個中國的格言吿訴大家：曰「不誠無物」，物是事物，即云如果不誠，什麽爭都辦不通。大家試想想看，意若不誠，待人處世尙談不到，何能担當完遂大東亞戰爭的大事業？所以作事一定要誠，作大事尤其得誠。曰：一誠之所至金石為開」，就是說，誠的力量極大，　金石那樣堅國亦可開之。我們拿東亞民族來講，不怕各民族不能團結，只怕誠有所未至。曰「至賊動人」，人類本是感情動物，　易起反應，待人接物如果出以至誠，對方自會被感動的。又曰：「至誠足以感動天地」。就是說，誠不僅能動人，尙可以感動天地。蓋尸誠能與天地萬物為一體也。</p>
<p>誠意的工夫是「格物」</p>
<p>一物－－我方纔已　訴過各位，是指事物。「格」就是「正」。所謂「格物」，是將不正的去掉　之正·不正是由私意而起就是不誠。我們對於事事物物如能念念不忘的去私欲，存天理，使意的發動無不善。隨時隨地把仁的本體顯現出來，這就是格物，也就是誠意的工夫。可是說來容易，做去很難，常常有人起初很盡他的誠意，而因對方小能諒解，以致心灰意冷感到厭煩，這種厭煩之心，也是一種私意，而不是誠意。或是起了不快之心，以致言語不遜，態度倣慢，動作野蠻，這便獎成惡意，不是誠意了。這樣以誠意始，以惡意終，是很可惜的事。至於起初便無誠意的人，是更要不得的，更不足以担當此劃時代的大事業的。舉例來說。中國人常說日本人有優越感。我不否認此說，因為日本一國之衆，任你國民訓練再好，亦不能担保無一人不患此病。但我憑良心說，日本人大多數並不抱有優越　，有許多智識份子，不僅絲毫沒有優越感還時時拿「優越感」這三個字來自肅自戒，並以吿誡其同胞，我對他們非常佩。同時我對少數抱有優越感的日本人，希望他們能把這種優越感去掉，　為一有優越感，意便不誠，就會起排拒作用。造成民族間的隔膜　有礙於東亞的團結而不能共同負起解放東亞的偉大使命。在解放東亞的戰爭中，日本站在領導地位，每一個日本人，都應該承其政府的最高意志，以至誠感化其他民族，即使一時不能得到對方諒解，也要耐心處之，始終以至誠對人，人類的情感是共通的，最終總會被感</p>
<p>誠意的工夫要在「克己恕人」（存恕）</p>
<p>如何，來下誠意的工夫呢？首在克己恕入一」。中國古書上有這樣的話：「克巳可以復　」禮者理也，因為能克巳，欃能得到事理之半，所謂克已，就像剛纔所說的，我們已盡到誠意，對方尙不諒解，你先不耍責備對方，只管反省自己，是否由於自已性急氣燥，未能把誠意表現出來？成言語之間，彼此發生〇誤會？或是我的誠尙不足以感人？我將再盡我的誠意，這就是「克已」。如果我們巳做到克巳工夫，對方還是不諒解，我們須檢討對方不諒解的緣故，是否被環境所迫，出於不得已或被其他私慾所蔽，出於一時的錯誤。而恕其旣往，策其將來，寄以同情，加以勸　，必使對方受此感動而後已，這便是「恕人」，亦是「存恕」。又如風俗習慣的不同，亦最易生誤解的，舉一個幾年前的事例來說，日本崗兵見到有些中國人走近崗位不脫帽，以為失敬，心中有所不快其實中國人對於脫帽，不大習慣，尤其是鄕下人，更是不懂，不是故意失敬的，現在日本人已漸明白這層了。大家要曉得，自國的風俗習慣為對方所不知，諒之可也，不應現出怒氣，可是我們對於對方的風俗習慣一定得知道，並須尊重它。如果不下誠意的工夫，遇了不檢討自已，徒責備別人，稍與自已的習慣不合，一不遂意，就顯出不愉快，憤怒，而出以野蠻動作，勢必引起對方的反抗，或面從心違，形成潛在的反抗意識，以將引起反抗的作用。過去中日兩國人之　常有這樣事實發生，很是可惜，故特舉出以為諸位參考。</p>
<p>以仁誠精神來敎育訓練中國</p>
<p>軍隊以協力大東亞戰爭</p>
<p>方纔已經說過，在中日戰爭中，日本已承認中國軍隊的戰爭精神遠　於英美，若益之以嚴格的敎育訓練，定可協力大東亞戰爭。為使很快負起這個使命，須於短期內厲行敎育訓練中國軍隊，使成烏有力的軍隊，以與日軍駢肩作戰，爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利，這是我個人最所希望的。</p>

<h3>China is not Monaco</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Yu</p>
<p>People often like to say, "The Soviet Union throws religion aside as opium, while China regards opium as religion." However, recently the Soviet Union has even opened up to religion, and China is gradually no longer considering opium as religion. In addition, the gambling habit, generally regarded as a Chinese weakness, is also not as popular among the new youth. This vice has long been regarded by Chinese patriots as the root of all evil, a means of poisoning the Chinese nation, and a tool for foreign governments to control China. The main goal of the recent Three Prohibitions Movement actually lies in these two things. Moreover, the students participating in the movement are all motivated by righteous indignation and patriotic enthusiasm. Now, when these young people attempt to assist the government in launching the New Citizen Movement, and to ban opium and gambling, which are generally regarded as China's incurable diseases, if they also know that the government they are assisting has already declared brothels and gambling dens legal and is protecting their business with the police, how will they feel? Because of this, the youth students may not be more enthusiastic about the New Citizen Movement. Moreover, precisely because they are young and energetic people full of enthusiasm for the country and the nation, they are likely to develop an even more terrible aversion. Therefore, the government's decision to limit the South City gambling dens to closure by the end of March, and to announce a three-year plan to ban opium, cannot but be considered a wise policy!</p>
<p>The problem that has not yet been resolved is the gambling dens in the First District. Following the ban on South City gambling dens by the end of March, if the gambling dens in the First District continue to operate as usual, then the customers addicted to the South City gambling dens will naturally transfer to the First District. The Two Prohibitions Movement was definitely not launched to attract business for the gambling dens in the First District. If that is the case, then the true purpose of the young students who responded to the call of the New Citizen Movement will be completely trampled upon. If it is considered wrong to roll dice in a glass box in the South City gambling dens, but it is considered right to throw balls vigorously against the wall in the First District gambling dens, then the South City can also throw dice vigorously against the wall! If it is said that the bad thing about the South City gambling dens is that they are Chinese-style, and the good thing about the gambling dens in the First District is that they are foreign-style, then the South City should adopt Japanese-style gambling, which would be even better than other foreign styles, wouldn't it? In short, the students participating in the Three Prohibitions Movement, who are angrily correcting the social atmosphere, do not have their deep-seated abhorrence change depending on whether the tools used by the Chinese for gambling are hard or soft, or whether the method is foreign or Chinese. What is wrong in the South City is also wrong in the First District, and what should be banned in the South should also be banned in the First District. Of course, I do not deny that if gambling dens are abolished, there may be institutions that fall into financial difficulties. However, China is not like the country of Monaco, where the gambling den's gate is guarded by the police, and the police are supported by the gambling den's profits. China is one of the world's leading great powers. If it imitates the world's number one small country, Monaco, and uses gambling den profits to support the police, then it would be more beneficial to abolish gambling dens and the police. There has always been a saying: "Money goes to the gambling den, people go to the courthouse." When gambling dens flourish, petty criminals increase; when petty criminals increase, the police must also increase; when the police increase, the expenses also increase, and thus it becomes necessary to fill the finances with gambling dens. However, conversely, if gambling dens are banned, then temporary inconvenience may occur, but soon after, petty criminals will also decrease, and when petty criminals decrease, police work will also decrease, and personnel can also be reduced. Therefore, the finances that must be filled with gambling dens need to be fundamentally re-examined.</p>
<p>Recently, the author heard that a foreign-style gambling company in the First District has already been established by the Chinese. Although it is hard to believe, it is all over the rumor mill. At a time when Chinese youth students are hoarsely singing for the prohibition of gambling, opium, and dancing, there are actually people who are investing in opening gambling companies, which I really can't believe. Perhaps this is also one of the many anti-propaganda efforts in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The government authorities recently arrested more than two hundred gold bar speculators. A certain newspaper editorial requested that these merchants be subjected to wartime criminal law for the crime of manipulating prices. During the period of waging the Greater East Asia War at the cost of any sacrifice, it is only natural to punish such degenerate elements. Naturally, the people expressed satisfaction with the authorities' decisive action. However, at the same time, in such a serious era, it is also hoped that the government authorities will clarify the major policy of banning gambling dens that promote speculative gambling, and not treat them differently because they are Chinese-style or foreign-style. At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the truth of the aforementioned anti-propaganda. If the establishment of the company is related to the behavior of manipulating the stock market, then it is hoped that the government will punish these people with the same severe punishment as the gold standard speculators.

<h3>American Newspaper Praises Japanese Army's Fighting Spirit</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the US military suffered unprecedented damage in the Gilbert operation, the demand for the US military to change its past combat methods from the US military and the public has been increasing day by day. The New York Times published a theory on January 15th, entitled "The Dalawa Teachings," pointing out the strong fighting spirit of the Japanese army and the difficulty of the war against Japan, and demanded a change in combat methods. The general idea is as follows: Although the full picture of the Gilbert operation has been clarified, the comprehensive figures for the damage suffered by the US military have not yet been released, but it is not difficult to imagine that it must be a very large number. We hope that the sacrifices of the US military can be compensated by the new base with a surplus of value, but unexpectedly, the damage to the attack army has created an unprecedented record. We must know that all Japanese soldiers have the fighting spirit to disregard their lives and not leave a single soldier, and the act of committing suicide is always carried out calmly. The Battle of Gilbert has proved that the Japanese army regards death as a home. If the Japanese army has to withdraw when necessary, they will never know what surrender is, and they are particularly strong in their hatred of cowards. According to the aforementioned situation, the United States must fundamentally change its attitude towards the war against Japan. The Gilbert operation can be regarded as a clock that informs the United States of how many difficulties and sacrifices will be faced in the future, and there will be large-scale fierce battles and many sacrifices in the Pacific in the future, so the strength of Japan should be accurately evaluated.</p>

<h3>Currency System of Huaihai Province; Adjustment Measures Have Been Established; Joint Reserve Bank Notes Will No Longer Be Issued Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Central Reserve Bank notes have been expanded to the Su-Huai area since December 1 last year, and are used together with the original Joint Reserve Bank notes in the area. Three months have passed since its implementation. Thanks to the continuous efforts of the fiscal bureau and the sincere cooperation of administrative and financial officials and related parties in the area, considerable achievements have been made. The Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank is also scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month, which will further facilitate financial cleansing and material adjustment in the area. The area has now been formally reorganized into Huaihai Province, an important part of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. In the future, the province's rapid development in politics, economy, military affairs, and other aspects, as well as the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, are closely related. Therefore, the importance of the province's status and the greatness of its mission after its establishment are recognized by all. In order to adapt to the environmental requirements, promote the rapid development of everything in the province, and complete its mission, the fiscal authorities should make further adjustments to the province's currency system. Based on the original plan to use the Central Reserve Bank notes together with the Chinese United Reserve Bank notes, and then stop the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the area after achieving results, special adjustment measures have been formulated. Starting from March 1, the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province will be stopped. However, it is still temporarily allowed to be used on the market, and it is stipulated that all treasury expenditures and bank payments, private contracts, etc. in the province must not be denominated in Joint Reserve Bank notes, and payments are limited to Central Reserve Bank notes. The currency system in North China and Central China will not change due to the implementation of these measures. It is firmly believed that after the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank notes in the province is stopped, the use of Central Reserve Bank notes will be further promoted. The government's unified currency policy has achieved another major achievement, and it can be predicted that the province's financial cleansing, material adjustment, and other work will have a groundbreaking development. Minister Zhou, who is also the Minister of Finance of the National Government, issued a solemn statement yesterday regarding the significance and measures of this move. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"After the Su-Huai Special Zone was ordered to be changed to Huaihai Province, it was reorganized and established on February 1 of this year. The province's currency has been originally scheduled to use the Central Reserve Bank notes together with the Chinese United Reserve Bank notes since December 1, 1932, and then stop the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the area after achieving results. Although only three months have passed since its implementation, the financial cleansing and material adjustment in Huaihai Province have become more convenient as a result, and the results are still good. Now, the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will also open on the 20th of this month, and the currency system of Huaihai Province should be further adjusted. The adjustment measures are divided as follows: From March 1, 1933, the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province should be stopped immediately, but they will still be accepted on the market. After March 1, 1933, all financial institutions in Huaihai Province shall stop paying Chinese United Reserve Bank notes and shall not use the notes as a unit for concluding contracts, but those who have previously concluded contracts with the notes shall still be allowed to continue trading. After that, the expenditure of treasury funds and the payment of bank deposits, loans, remittances, etc. in Huaihai Province will no longer use Chinese United Reserve Bank notes, but will be limited to Central Reserve Bank notes. The currency system in North China and Central China will not undergo fundamental changes due to this measure. Based on the above measures, the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the province has been stopped, and the use of Central Reserve Bank notes will inevitably be further promoted. All of our people must look up to the government's intentions, earnestly follow them, and see the results. Do not disobey, or you will be punished. This is the most fortunate thing. In addition to submitting reports and distributing them, this solemn statement is made."</p>

Expanding the Central Reserve Bank note circulation area and promoting the smooth exchange of goods between the region, Central China, and North China will contribute to the stability of people's livelihoods and the economic construction in the region.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Postal Administration in Huai Province</h3>

<h3>Finnish Interior Minister Returns from Sweden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Finnish Interior Minister Yrjö Leino, who has been staying in Stockholm, flew back to Helsinki by plane on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Berlin Watches the Development of the Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German diplomatic circles claim that British reports that ships in Danish ports are not allowed to sail are completely untrue, and that the claim that General Dietl is preparing to retreat from northern Finland is also false.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency foreign correspondent Hoen writes: The Finnish issue continues to be the focus of political discussion in enemy and neutral newspapers. British and American newspapers still claim that the only condition the Soviet Union can accept is Finland's unconditional surrender. However, at the same time, the British and American newspapers and communist newspapers in neutral countries have suddenly changed their tune and claimed that the Soviet Union is prepared to deal with Finland in a moderate way. Given Moscow's recent diplomatic and political trends, this change in deceptive tactics in the enemy camp is not surprising. However, it must be known that Finland has ample experience and knows that the Soviet people do not attach much value to any conditions signed in Moscow. The Finnish people are keenly aware of the Soviet Union's delaying tactics. In this situation, Berlin will wait quietly for future developments with the same attitude as before. Berlin is confident that the responsible politicians and the people of Finland will not be deceived by the various contradictory propaganda of the Soviet Union and will understand that force is the decisive factor.</p>

<p>Berlin, 19th (German News Agency dispatch) - Military sources reported yesterday that General Vatutin's chief of staff, Ivanov, has been dismissed by Marshal Chuikov. This information was provided by Soviet staff officers captured by the Soviets in the Siversky Donets area. General Vatutin is the commander of the Soviet forces on the Ukrainian front.</p>
<h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat on the West Bank of the Narva River; German Group Breaks Through on the Southern Route</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas dispatch, hundreds of artillery pieces have been firing at each other on the west bank of the Narva River in recent days. The night sky is lit up by the flames of war. There is fierce fighting along the highway from Narva to Narva-Jõesuu. Forests and frozen areas to the north have also been destroyed by artillery fire. After five hours of heavy artillery bombardment, Soviet forces were able to cross the Narva River, enter the German positions, and gain a foothold on the west bank. Soviet forces continue to cross the frozen river and advance westward. German artillery prevents the enemy from advancing along the highway to await reinforcements. The German soldiers defending the eastern bridgehead of Narva are in a precarious situation. Their supply lines are in danger of being cut off, and they themselves are in danger of being surrounded and annihilated. Therefore, volunteers from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands have been mobilized and formed into teams to repel the enemy forces crossing the river and advancing westward. German artillery fires salvos, causing the houses in Narva to shake. German armored vehicle crews bravely counterattack with grenades and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the westward-advancing Soviet forces, eventually repelling the enemy. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. While the German heavy artillery to the north of the highway was deployed, the German artillery fire prevented the enemy from advancing immediately, and the firing was very accurate. The enemy forces on the west bank of the Narva River were annihilated. More than a thousand Soviet soldiers' corpses were left in the forests and swamps, and Soviet soldiers' corpses were also piled up everywhere on the Narva River ice.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas dispatch, the German forces besieged west of Cherkasy broke through and joined forces with Marshal von Manstein's main force, shattering the Soviet's hope of encircling a large German force and greatly alleviating the situation on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In the past few years, German forces have adopted a strategy of large-scale encirclements, inflicting serious losses on the enemy. The Battle of Cherkasy proved its value again. The Soviet's operational goal of annihilating a large part of the German forces, creating a gap in the German line, and then making a long, direct assault has failed again. The new developments in the battle here have made Moscow's news of the encirclement of a large German force unfounded. The Soviet's offensives in the Vitebsk area have repeatedly failed and have now temporarily ceased. Only in the Narva area in the north has the Soviet's offensive not stopped, but the attacking forces rarely exceed a company. The German withdrawal from Staraya Russa and areas deep in the enemy's rear is part of the German's action to straighten the line.</p>
<p>The Battle of Offense and Defense in the Central Sector Comes to an End Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reports: There were no major battles on the central sector of the Eastern Front on Thursday. The calm since February 17 has brought the Second Battle of Defense of Vitebsk to an end. Although the Soviet forces mobilized six army corps, a total of 53 infantry divisions, 13 tank brigades, and a strong artillery force in the southeast and northwest of the town, they ultimately failed to achieve a breakthrough. On the contrary, they lost more than 1,000 prisoners of war, 363 tanks, 91 artillery pieces, hundreds of machine guns, and other heavy infantry weapons.</p>
<p>120,000 German Troops Successfully Break Out</p>
<p>The most important thing on the southern route of the Eastern Front is that a group of German forces, after being cut off for several days, re-established contact. February 4th was one of the unluckiest days the Red Army announced. Three days later, the enemy again claimed that the protected German forces had been tightly confined to an area of 40 square kilometers. Four days later, the area had shrunk to 20 square kilometers. At the same time, the Soviet forces claimed to have surrounded 110,000 German troops. On February 15th, the Red Army admitted that the German relief offensive had made progress. The Soviet encirclement around the German forces was said to be 40 kilometers, but in reality, it was 10 kilometers wide. On the evening of February 16th, the Soviet command admitted that the German tank offensive in Zvenigorodka had been victorious and claimed that the encirclement was still 20 kilometers wide. In fact, the protected German units had joined the German tank group on that day. Although the Soviet forces broke through this German contact again, they suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle in Torrential Rain on the Anzio Front in Italy; U.S. Fifth Army Retreats Slightly</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Allied headquarters in North Africa obtained here today, there is bloody fighting in torrential rain in Anzio, Italy. The U.S. Fifth Army has been unable to withstand the tremendous pressure from the German forces and has retreated slightly. Field Marshal Kesselring is fighting in Anzio with four divisions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (German News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command announced that German forces, using a large number of artillery pieces, continue to engage in fierce fighting with the enemy forces in the Nettuno bridgehead, thereby further reducing the encirclement of the enemy forces to four kilometers south of Aprilia. The enemy's counterattacks with the assistance of tank units have been ineffective. As for the American forces in Cassino, because their strength has weakened, they have been replaced by Indian troops. Indian troops launched a full-day assault on the mountains in Cassino, but all attacks failed. German forces immediately filled several gaps in their positions when the enemy did not counterattack. The Cassino railway station has been gained and lost several times, but it is still occupied by German forces.</p>
<p>Temple Ruins Filled with Corpses</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Cassino Monastery has been reduced to ruins. The last resident of the monastery, the 83-year-old abbot, Father Amalarius, left on the 18th at the request of the German representatives, accompanied by the surviving priests and monks. The abbot has decided to go to Rome soon to make a detailed report to Pope Pius XII. Furthermore, due to the inhumane attacks by the Allied forces, hundreds of corpses of monks and more than 600 other people have been exhumed from the ruins of the monastery.</p>

<h3>Germany's Total Power</h3>
<p>The Japanese Asahi Shimbun held a roundtable discussion with its correspondents in Berlin and Switzerland on the theme of "Germany's Total Power," with each stating their observations on the ground. The following is an attached note.</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: What we expect is how Allied Germany will counter the European offensive of Britain and the United States. Regarding Germany's strong military strength, productivity, and the people's unwavering belief in victory, please describe them in detail.</p>
<p>Germany Facing a Two-Front War</p>
<p>Correspondent Moriyama (Berlin): If military strength, productivity, and the people's unwavering belief in victory are combined to form total war power, then I believe that Germany's total war power is definitely not weaker than it was two or three years ago in terms of its absolute quantity, and weapons have been improved. Soldiers have accumulated combat experience. So why is Germany not advancing? That is because the war situation has unknowingly turned into a two-front war. Germany is now attacked from both sides by the Soviet army and the greatly expanded American army. The fundamental idea of ​​blitzkrieg warfare concentrated on a single front must be changed to a strategy and tactics of two-front warfare. Germany's shift to defensive warfare since the autumn of last year is the inevitable sacrifice of this transformation. Since about August last year, the conversion of the aircraft industry into an agency to carry out the two-sided war has ended, and because of last year's general mobilization, all men in Germany who can hold a gun have put on military uniforms. According to German official explanations, Germany's successive retreats since Stalingrad were due to the overwhelming superiority in enemy troops and the quantity of military equipment. However, in today's decisive battle, we will not discuss the relationship between Germany's war power, which has gathered all the country's total power, and the Soviet Union, which is its superior. I will quote the explanation of Minister of Propaganda Goebbels to clarify the relationship.</p>
<p>"Perhaps Britain and the United States are about to try to open a second front! Moreover, the number of enemy troops and equipment may be superior to our German army. However, the difficulty of sea transportation, which is the logistics of these troops, offsets the enemy's superiority in troops, and their power is only equal to our army. But we can see from the results achieved by our army in the Italian front, which is at a disadvantage, what kind of results will occur when the German army is equal to the enemy in strength. Therefore, my Germany will definitely win on the second front."</p>
<p>There are still things to consider in this theory, that is, Germany is aware of using spirit and tactics to make up for its shortcomings, and that kind of awareness is becoming more and more intense, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: Please observe the impressions of the current war situation from the perspective of neutral countries.</p>
<p>Observations of Neutral Countries</p>
<p>Correspondent Kasa (Switzerland): At the present stage, the following points will ultimately determine the situation in all of Europe: the Soviet-Polish border issue and the disclosure of the truth about the Anglo-German peace talks by Pravda are bombs dropped by the Soviet Union on Germany. The rift between Britain and the Soviet Union has widened due to these two incidents. As a result, many of the careful preparations made by Britain from the Moscow talks to the Tehran talks have completely failed. The Soviet Union has now taken off its mask, which is because Britain is showing cowardice towards the second front. If Germany takes advantage of this rift between Britain and the Soviet Union to launch a major blow on the second front, the state of equilibrium between the Soviet Union and Britain will collapse at one blow. This is an excellent opportunity for Germany. Therefore, the second front will turn into an opportunity that is advantageous to Germany.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the Eastern Front and the bombing of Germany are still issues worthy of attention. As far as the Eastern Front is concerned, everything will be determined by Germany's newly sharpened reserve army. As for the bombing of Germany, it should not be taken too seriously. Everything depends on whether Germany can maintain the system set by Minister of the Interior Himmler. The purpose of the bombing is to collapse the Himmler system and weaken the war power. The Himmler system not only raises the morale of the German people, but also uses its organizational power to maintain the morale of the army. He also fulfilled an important task. Therefore, judging from the current situation, this system is far more resilient than generally imagined.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the food aspect, as a result of the increased harvest of agricultural crops last year, there is no need to worry about supply. Finally, we can say that the European war is not a war on one side, but a war on three sides. That is, the German-Soviet war, the German-British war, and the dispute between the British and the Soviet Union. The state of this war is becoming clearer day by day. In Germany, the room for fully developing its policies and war is also becoming more and more expanded. This is the impression gained from the current situation.

<h3>Free Trade of Yarn and Cloth Permitted in Three Provinces and Two Municipalities Outside the Shanghai District; Unrestricted Transfer of Goods Other Than Controlled Money</h3>
<p>Outside parties have many misunderstandings regarding the methods of purchasing and transporting yarn and cloth outside the Shanghai area. According to the reporter's inquiry with the Business Coordination Committee, the principle of free trade is temporarily adopted for cotton yarn and cotton cloth within the borders of the three provinces and two municipalities outside the Shanghai area. This has been notified by the Ministry of Industry, and all normal commercial supply and demand, rather than attempts at monopoly or manipulation, can be handled accordingly. As for the movement of yarn and cloth, according to the "Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement," except for goods being transported out of the Shanghai control line, which requires the permission of the Committee, there are no explicit restrictions on mutual transport between the three provinces and two municipalities, and there is no need to apply for a transport permit.</p>
<p>Conclusion of Yarn and Cloth Purchase</p>
<p>According to the reporter's inquiry with the Business Coordination Committee, the Committee has recently stipulated that the Cotton Industry Management Office shall handle the allocation of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other materials. All factories and businesses shall, for matters related to allocation, go through their respective industry associations or the Cotton Products Industry Association and then transfer the matter to the Committee, which shall instruct the Cotton Industry Management Office to handle it. The Committee will not directly correspond with the factories and businesses. Matters regarding the inspection and acceptance of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the purchase case, the retention of movement within the city, and the issuance of special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificates from the Central Reserve Bank will be handled by the Committee's newly formed Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchase Settlement Committee. Factories and businesses should now contact the Committee directly at 984 Datong Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII), telephone 60086 or 33015, regarding the above-mentioned matters. It is also reported that the Cotton Industry Management Office will move from 304 Huangpi Road (formerly Route Massenet) to 306 Taixing Road (formerly Route de Gènes) on February 21, telephone 34242, 34243, 34244.</p>
<p>Free Transport of Old Clothes and Rags</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality's Clothing Industry Association, Transport and Customs Declaration Industry Association, and Waste Machine Maintenance Industry Association have requested the Business Coordination Committee to stipulate the transfer methods for old clothes and rags from the Shanghai area to the three provinces and two municipalities so that they can follow them. According to the reporter's inquiry, the Business Coordination Committee has, after deliberation with relevant parties, deemed that free transport is permitted without the need for a transport permit. A case for preparation has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and distributed to relevant ministries and the governments of the three provinces and two municipalities for their subordinate inspection agencies to comply with.</p>
<p>Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office Resigns</p>
<p>Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth in August of last year, the Office for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth was immediately established, and Mr. Nie Lusheng, a leader in the yarn factory industry, was appointed as the director. After the yarn and cloth registration procedures were completed, the office was reorganized into the Cotton Industry Management Office, with Mr. Nie still serving as the director. It is now reported that Mr. Nie has recently applied to the Business Coordination Committee to resign due to his physical inability to handle the complicated matters. The letter of resignation states, "To the esteemed Sirs: When the purchase of yarn and cloth was concluded, I explained to you that I would retire once the reorganized office was in good shape. Now that the purchasing affairs, due to the retail merchants, cloth merchants, cotton weaving factories, and applicants for sale who have deposit certificates, the cotton yarn and cloth have all been granted a delay in inspection and acceptance. There are not many tasks remaining in the future. All of the fixed-term deposit certificates for the goods that have been inspected and accepted in the past, whether in whole or in part, have been prepared, but more than one hundred copies have not been issued because the sellers have not come to collect them. The allocation affairs have been entrusted to Deputy Directors Sun and Benda by you. As for important official affairs, I rely on you to preside over them, and the pending documents are handled by the various committee members. The daily events are the responsibility of the two deputy directors and the various departments. The reorganization has been largely completed. Since taking office in August of last year, Lusheng has made few contributions to the association and has been of no benefit to the industry. Although I have tried to be public-minded, I am only ridiculed for being a sinecure. In addition, I have become lazy and accustomed to being at home in recent years. It is difficult for me to cope with sudden complexity and my energy is not enough. Recently, I often feel uneasy and sleepless after reading documents and talking, delaying official business and misleading others and myself. Reflecting on myself, I feel uneasy. I hereby resign from the position of Director of the Cotton Industry Management Office from today and respectfully request that you send someone to succeed me so that I can relieve myself of this responsibility. I eagerly await your orders. This is presented to Chairman Tang, February 16, 33rd year of the Republic."</p>
<h3>Methods for Transferring Vegetables, Fruits, Etc. from North China to Central China; First Obtain a Transport Permit from the Central Market</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - In order to promote the exchange of materials between North China and Central China to a more ideal stage, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy has assisted the Shanghai Special Municipality's Central Market in repeatedly conducting detailed negotiations with the control agencies in North China, the North China Trade Control Headquarters, last year. Until recently, a concrete decision has been made. The Shanghai Office of the North China Trade Control Headquarters and the Central Market will jointly announce today (20th): Starting March 1st, anyone who wants to transfer vegetables, fruits, dried fruits, and other agricultural products produced in North China (Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Zhifu, Henan, etc.) to various places in Central China must first obtain a transport permit from the Central Market to facilitate collection and transportation. It is said that Central Market Director Tao Wenqi specially made an important statement yesterday, saying: "Under the wartime controlled economy, the exchange of materials must be planned. The joint new facilities of the North China Trade Control Headquarters and this market will facilitate the transfer of materials from North China and make the operation of materials in North China and Central China smooth. It is expected to contribute to the supply of materials and the suppression of prices. In order to make this material exchange policy foolproof, this market has recently conducted detailed and full discussions with the relevant authorities, making it as convenient as possible for merchants to collect and transport North China products. In the past, exchange rates and other issues have caused much inconvenience, but in the future, this market will strive to solve the difficulties."</p>

<h3>China United Film Company's Screening of "Invincible Piefu" Film</h3>
<p>In order to introduce "Invincible Piefu," produced by Japan's Daiei Motion Picture Co., Ltd., and to announce the details of "Spring River Regret," a collaborative project between China and Japan soon to begin filming, the China United Film Company held a special screening yesterday at 3:30 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, inviting guests from all walks of life in the city. Attendees included the company's General Manager Feng Jie, Publicity Director Xiu Yu, and from the Japanese side, Department Chief Matsushima, Captain Shiota, and dozens of directors and stars from Daiei and China Film. Daiei's Publicity Department Chief Kaga Shiro delivered an introductory speech, followed by the screening of "Invincible Piefu." After the film screening, a tea party was held at 5:00 PM.

The event concluded at around 6:00 PM with the guests and hosts parting on good terms.</p>
<p>Broadcasting time yesterday: 7:20 PM</p>
<p>Industrial Fuel Distributed Regularly</p>
<p>Since the start of the Lunar New Year, most factories in the city have been operating at a standstill or half capacity. The reason for this is the doubled manufacturing costs, high expenses, and the lack of raw materials. However, it appears that factories have been able to obtain sufficient daily fuel (smelting coal). Moreover, due to recent restrictions on electricity supply and other factors, they only operate during the day and rest at night, so their coal consumption is somewhat lower than in the past. However, coal distribution continues uninterrupted, so the fuel needs of most factories should not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Prices for Buying Hemp Determined</h3>
<p>Last year's hemp production saw a bumper harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with statistics indicating an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. To facilitate the purchase of hemp, the authorities concerned formulated unified measures for implementation. To encourage farmers to willingly sell and continue planting, the purchase prices were also raised as much as possible. Recently, it was learned from relevant sources that purchase prices in various regions have been determined. However, because the harvests in different regions vary slightly, prices will also be adjusted accordingly. The purchase prices in the Suzhou area are divided into three grades: 800 yuan for Grade 1, 750 yuan for Grade 2, and 700 yuan for Grade 3. The Nantong area is about 600 yuan, and the Linping area near Hangzhou is about 500-600 yuan.</p>

<h3>First Division Soccer Match Yesterday: Luen Yee Defeats Jewish 7-2</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Shanghai League First Division, Luen Yee faced Jewish again yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Because Liu Xianhan was absent, Lu Gusui served as goalkeeper in the first half, performing poorly. Li Yichen arrived in the second half and replaced Gu Sui. Wu Qixiang mistakenly scored, and Zhou Qilin played as a guest player. Less than four minutes into the game, Fei Chunhua took a corner kick, and Afu's shot hit the crossbar and bounced out. Gao Baozheng sent the ball into the net. One minute later, A. Kue hit hard from 20 yards, and the ball went into the left corner. After 20 minutes, Xiao Fei scored successfully. Luen Yee led 3-1 in the first half. After the break, the Jewish team counterattacked, making it 3-2. However, Luen Yee's offensive then surged, scoring consecutive free kicks. The final score was 7-2, and Luen Yee defeated Jewish again.</p>

<h3>From the Revival of Oriental Culture to the Responsibility of Chinese Military Advisor's Aides: A Speech Given to Japanese Military Advisor Officers on the 3rd of this Month</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shuyi</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the Revival of Oriental Culture and the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Oriental culture has a long history of thousands of years. When Oriental culture had reached a considerable height, most Western ethnic groups were still in a barbaric era. This is recognized by the world. However, for hundreds of years, Oriental nations either closed themselves off, or declined, gradually weakening. Western nations, on the other hand, seized their utilitarianism, crossed the sea to invade the East, and became strong. In the past, our Oriental nations went from prosperity to decline, while Western nations went from decline to prosperity. Now, our Oriental nations will go from decline to prosperity, and Western nations, such as British and American imperialists, will inevitably go from prosperity to decline. This is the law of historical change. The Sino-Japanese Incident was indeed unfortunate for the two major nations of China and Japan, but because of this incident, Japan confirmed that the fighting spirit of the Chinese army far surpasses that of Britain and the United States. If this strong fighting spirit is strengthened with strict education and training, it will definitely be able to jointly defend East Asia with Japan. Furthermore, the power demonstrated by the Japanese army, navy, and air force in the Greater East Asia War, and the great success achieved, are unprecedented in the history of warfare. It can be judged that the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely belong to us. Taking the victory of the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, Oriental culture will surely be revived, and the East Asian nations will surely be liberated.</p>
<p>The Essence of Oriental Culture – "Benevolence"</p>
<p>The essence of Oriental culture is "benevolence." To explain benevolence, one must mention Chinese Neo-Confucianism. Mr. Wang Yangming's explanation of "benevolence" is to preserve heavenly principles and eliminate human desires. If a person can constantly remember to preserve heavenly principles, and not allow a bit of selfishness to obscure the essence of benevolence, the essence of benevolence will naturally manifest itself. Chinese Confucianists often say that great benevolence leads to great courage. Confucius said "sacrifice oneself to achieve benevolence," and Mencius said "give up life for righteousness." These are both acts of great courage. Why can a person voluntarily sacrifice himself? Because benevolence and righteousness are more valuable than one's body and life. Therefore, it is said that great benevolence leads to great courage. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for nations. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "An army that is upright is strong, while an army that is crooked is old." It also says, "An army must have a just cause." Taking the Greater East Asia War as an example, the Oriental nations are being invaded and forced to fight. They are fighting to win liberation, so naturally they are confident and have a just cause. Britain and the United States are invaders, fighting to invade other nations to satisfy their desires. Their cause is unjust, so their principles are crooked and their spirit is weak. In terms of benevolence and courage, we are sure to win, while Britain and the United States are sure to lose.</p>
<p>The Expression of Benevolence is "Sincerity"</p>
<p>Benevolence is the essence of the heart, so human nature is inherently good. Therefore, Mencius said that human nature is good. However, when intentions arise, they may be tempted by external things or obscured by selfish intentions, leading to evil. If we can eliminate selfish desires and keep the essence of our hearts pure and without dross, we will not generate great evil intentions. This is called sincerity. Therefore, the expression of benevolence is "sincerity."</p>
<p>"The effect of sincerity is great. I can share a few Chinese maxims with you: 'Without sincerity, there is nothing.' 'Nothing' refers to matters, meaning that if you are not sincere, nothing can be accomplished. Everyone, think about it. If your intentions are not sincere, you cannot even talk about dealing with people, let alone shouldering and completing the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you must be sincere in everything you do, especially when doing big things. It is said: 'Where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will be opened.' This means that the power of sincerity is extremely great, and even things as firm as metal and stone can be opened. Taking East Asian nations as an example, we are not afraid that the various nations cannot unite, but only that sincerity is not fully realized. It is said: 'Utmost sincerity moves people.' Human beings are inherently emotional animals and easily react. If you treat people with utmost sincerity, they will naturally be moved. It is also said: 'Utmost sincerity is enough to move heaven and earth.' This means that sincerity can not only move people, but also move heaven and earth. This is because sincerity can unite with heaven, earth, and all things."</p>
<p>The Effort of Sincerity is "Investigating Things"</p>
<p>"Things" – I have already told everyone that this refers to matters. "Investigate" means "rectify." The so-called "investigating things" is to remove what is incorrect and rectify it. Incorrectness arises from selfishness, which is insincerity. If we can constantly remember to eliminate selfish desires and preserve heavenly principles in all matters, so that no evil arises from our intentions, and constantly reveal the essence of benevolence at all times and in all places, this is investigating things, which is the effort of sincerity. However, it is easy to say, but difficult to do. Often, people initially try their best to be sincere, but become discouraged and annoyed because the other party cannot understand. This feeling of annoyance is also a kind of selfishness, not sincerity. Or, they become unhappy, leading to impolite words, slow attitudes, and uncivilized actions. This then becomes malice, not sincerity. It is a pity when sincerity begins but ends in malice. As for those who have no sincerity from the beginning, they are even more unacceptable and unqualified to shoulder this epoch-making great undertaking. For example, Chinese people often say that Japanese people have a sense of superiority. I do not deny this, because no matter how well trained the citizens of Japan are, it cannot be guaranteed that no one will suffer from this problem. But I can honestly say that most Japanese people do not have a sense of superiority. Many intellectuals not only do not have a sense of superiority, but also constantly use the words "sense of superiority" to self-reflect and self-admonish, and to warn their compatriots. I admire them very much. At the same time, I hope that the few Japanese people who have a sense of superiority can eliminate this sense of superiority. If they have a sense of superiority, their intentions will not be sincere, which will lead to rejection. This will create a gap between nations and hinder East Asian unity, making it impossible to jointly shoulder the great mission of liberating East Asia. In the war to liberate East Asia, Japan stands in a leadership position. Every Japanese person should uphold the highest will of their government and use sincerity to influence other nations. Even if the other party cannot understand immediately, they must be patient and treat others with sincerity at all times. Human emotions are universal, and eventually they will be moved.</p>
<p>The Effort of Sincerity Lies in "Self-Restraint and Forgiveness of Others" (Preserving Forgiveness)</p>
<p>How can we put in the effort of sincerity? First, we must "restrain ourselves and forgive others." There is a saying in ancient Chinese books: "Restraining oneself can return to ritual." Ritual is reason. Because one can restrain oneself, one can obtain half of the reason. The so-called restraining oneself is, as I just said, when we have tried our best to be sincere, but the other party still does not understand, we should not blame the other party first. Instead, we should reflect on ourselves, whether it is because we are impatient and quick-tempered, and have not been able to express our sincerity? Or because there are misunderstandings between our words? Or because my sincerity is not enough to move people? I will try my best to be sincere again. This is "restraining oneself." If we have done the work of restraining ourselves, but the other party still does not understand, we must examine the reasons why the other party does not understand, whether it is because they are forced by circumstances, out of necessity, or obscured by other selfish desires, out of a temporary mistake. We should forgive their past mistakes, encourage their future, give them sympathy, and persuade them, until the other party is moved. This is "forgiving others," which is also "preserving forgiveness." Furthermore, differences in customs and habits are also most likely to cause misunderstandings. To give an example from a few years ago, Japanese sentries saw some Chinese people approaching their posts without taking off their hats, and thought it was disrespectful, feeling unhappy in their hearts. In fact, Chinese people are not used to taking off their hats, especially those in the countryside, who do not understand. It is not intentionally disrespectful. Now, Japanese people have gradually understood this. Everyone must understand that the customs and habits of your own country may not be known to the other party. This is understandable and you should not show anger. However, we must know the customs and habits of the other party and respect them. If we do not put in the effort of sincerity, and instead of examining ourselves, blame others, and show unhappiness, anger, and uncivilized actions when things do not conform to our habits, it will inevitably cause resistance from the other party, or face-to-face compliance but inner disagreement, forming a latent sense of resistance, which will then cause resistance. In the past, such things often happened between Chinese and Japanese people, which is very regrettable. Therefore, I have specifically mentioned this for your reference.</p>
<p>Educate and Train the Chinese Army with the Spirit of Benevolence and Sincerity to Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>As I have already said, in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has recognized that the fighting spirit of the Chinese army far surpasses that of Britain and the United States. If this is strengthened with strict education and training, it will definitely be able to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. To enable them to quickly shoulder this mission, we must strictly educate and train the Chinese army in a short period of time, so that it becomes a powerful army that can fight alongside the Japanese army and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is my personal greatest hope.</p>
