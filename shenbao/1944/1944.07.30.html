<p>星期評論檢討</p>
<h3>「罪已的精神」</h3>
<p>— 沈志遠</p>
<p>記得民國二十九年四月二十六日，汪主席曾提出「罪已的精神」一文，說明罪已的精神，固與傲慢不同，與卑屈更不同。復申述罪已的精神，第一要有深切的反省，第二要有深刻的責任心。那時國府還都不久，汪主席對國事的態度，如此坦白誠摯，不愧為政治界的風格，國人極為感動。</p>
<p>如今國府還都已四年了，我們一檢討　汪主席所提出的「罪已的精神」，在這四年中我們究竟做到了多少？貫澈到如何程度？或是有沒有違背的地方？這都是當前最重要的課題。</p>
<p>首先要說明的，就是罪已的精神，旣與傲慢不同類又與卑屈有別，當然不會像抗戰派那麼狂妄，也不會像媚外派那麼卑躬節，持此態度，四年來外得盟邦同情，內得民眾擁護，因此，中日基本條約的取消，同盟條約的締結，治外法權的撤廢，租界，敵產，及軍管理工塲的交還，都可以說就是這點旣不傲慢又不卑屈的罪已精神的惟一收獲。</p>
<p>其次，根據罪已的精神，我們應該深切反省的是：國府還都時，所標舉的對內實施憲政，對外實現和平兩大國策，這四年來，不但和平政策未能貫澈，即實施憲政，亦復遙遙無期，這其間，是由於人事上因循座誤呢？還是力有未遂呢？這是上自政府當局下至國民都應該作一深切的反省。</p>
<p>復次，根據罪已的精神，我們應該檢討的是：這四年來對於國事，有沒有盡過最大的努力？譬如說：還都時，上海米價僅售舊法幣四十元一石，中小學的學費每學期只有二三十元，而四年後的現在米價最高每石一萬三千元，中小學費增至數千元，這其中原因何在？政府何以不能平抑物價？還有，政治上為什麼有許多事往往祇有計劃而無法推動？再說：大東亞戰爭已達決勝關頭，盟邦日本的東條內閣，尚且所在都是？這又是什麼緣故？我們對於目前政治經濟的病態，應不應發生一點深刻的責任感！</p>
<p>論語云：「邦有道危言危行，邦無道危行言孫。」我們不欲危害行孫以阿世取容，寗願危言危行云開罪於人，講人家所不願意聽的話，並且希望舉國上下，應該認清目前已是決戰階段，大家應該重新反省　汪先生「罪已的精神」，不要放棄每個國家所應該負的責任。</p>
<h3>泰宣傳局發表　內閣總辭職</h3>
<p>盤谷二十九日中央社電　泰國宣傳局二十九日上午十時發表：畢本內閣業行總辭職。</p>
<p>盤谷二十八日中央社電　泰國畢本內閣，前對改培查布恩車為特別行政區及薩拉布里附近建設佛都兩事，曾以緊急勅令公布之，至二十日及二十二日，要求國民會議對該兩勅令於奏呈後承認之，但遭會議否決，於是畢本內閣基於泰國憲政之本意，遂決意內閣總辭職，並於二十二日將全體閣僚之辭呈，向攝政府提出。</p>
<h3>大宮迭尼安兩島激戰繼續進行中　北緬方面敵傷亡達五萬眾</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　迭尼安島日軍守備隊，二十四日晨於沿岸水際截擊企圖登陸之敵軍，將其擊退，下午更裁擊用戰車登陸之敵軍（約一師人），與之展開激戰，其後戰綫漸次移向南方。至二十六日晨，據守茄羅農園及東部電報局一帶之日軍，與敵軍形成對峙之局面，計二十四日擊退第一次登陸敵軍時，敵軍損失千七百餘人，二十四日下午敵軍損失三百餘人，二十六日拂曉激戰中，敵軍損失二百餘人，敵軍迄今損失四千二百餘人。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　本週戰况如次：</p>
<p>北平洋方面美空軍依然蠢動，曾於二十三日夜，二十四日白晝來襲北千島，日航空部隊則協力陸上部隊邀擊敵機，二十三日擊落擊毀敵機二架，二十四日擊落兩架，擊毀一架。</p>
<p>中國方面（陸上作戰），　日軍於湖南方面粵漢綫東側地區，殲滅安仁（衡陽東南十公里）之渝軍，完全佔領該地，更自醴陵，茶陵及安仁方面進攻，日軍正分別與之交戰中，又日軍仍繼續猛攻衡陽市街中，更在粵漢綫西北地區金蘭寺，白鶴舖一帶，攻擊來製之渝軍，渝軍救援衡陽守備軍，曾使渝第六十二軍之第六百五十一師及百五十七師兩師，在雨母山衡陽西南十公里及十七公里山附近進攻，日軍已予以殲滅打擊。　華南方面戰况亦正順利進展中。（航空戰）駐渝美空軍除協力華中，華南之陸上作戰及衡陽渝軍作戰外，並擔任戰塲上空之警戒，日軍於二十一日衡陽空戰中，擊落擊毀渝機四架，於長沙上空擊毀一架，二十三日於華中戰塲上空擊落擊毀渝機五架。二十五日在岳州·常德上空擊落擊毀渝機七架，一方在進攻渝軍基地之作戰中，亦收獲赫赫戰果，即二十四日進攻零陵，擊毀渝機十八架，日機則均全部飛速，七月中旬渝機來襲百五十五次，累計千餘架，僅日空軍之戰果，即擊落擊毀其百九十架，日方僅損失十一架。</p>
<p>緬甸方面（陸上作戰），敵軍似正調派第四，第三十三兩軍，救援伊姆法爾，在日軍前方逐次增强兵力，日軍則奮勇作戰，於一部地區縮短戰綫，刻仍在激戰中。北緬甸方面，密芝那仍在日軍手中，敵新編制第三十八師，二十二師及西非旅團，自富航向摩加恩方面南下，日軍則確保特浦（摩加恩西南十八公里）以西之要點，連日正繼續激戰中。該方面日軍克服地形及氣候之困難，已予敵以重創，自該方面作戰開始以來，迄現在止，敵之損失計傷亡五萬之眾，怒江方面戰事無大變化，日軍仍確陣地，乘機擊破敵之反攻。</p>
<p>中部太平洋方面，自塞班島失陷後，敵軍即分別於二十一日晨及二十三日在大宮島及迭尼安島登陸，目下日·美兩軍仍在激戰中。又敵機對於南洋一帶之日軍據點，亦曾作積極之轟炸，塞班島方面，敵刻正利用阿斯利特機塲中。大宮島方面，敵海上部隊，於十七日傍晚曾以運輸船數十艘，靠近該島岸邊，十八日更以艦載機二百餘架來襲，十九日敵艦隊復侵入該島西岸之明石灣，昭和灣，不分晝夜，實行砲轟。二十日敵艦載機二百餘架來襲，靠近海岸之艦艇復行砲轟，二十日晨敵又以二師以上之軍隊，在砲火之掩護下，曾在明石灣，昭和灣地區登陸，日所在部隊乃集結於明石市街南方地區，對在該方面登陸之敵，實行猛攻，刻仍在奮戰中。據美陸長史汀生宣稱：截至登陸後二十五日止，敵軍之損失，已達三千三百十一人，迭尼安港方面，自二十日以來，敵機來襲該港頓見頻繁，二十二日曾偵察失尼安港外，二十三日敵艦隊（包括戰艦巡洋艦驅逐艦約十艘）亦曾出現於該島附近，並實行砲擊，於是敵兵即藉砲擊之掩護，謀在迭尼安港及該島西北部地區登陸，但該方面日軍使敵戰艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘起火焚燒，並將敵擊退。在西北地區方面，日軍雖曾二度擊退來犯之敵，但其後敵軍增援作第三次之攻擊，故終於在該島登陸，茲日軍仍在確保該島中部以南地區，與北方侵入之敵約一師在激戰中。又敵機之來襲西加羅林羣島及羅特島亦形熾烈化，如二十三·二十五·二十七·三日間，敵軍咸以小編隊續行轟炸。又二十一日敵機二十架，二十二日二十二架，曾連續襲擊雅普，結果有二架被擊落，五架以上被擊毀，二十四日以二十一架襲那盧，以一百三十架襲渥賽，以二十五架襲美萊庸，二十五日以百架左右襲擊師勞羣島（擊落七架），二十六日以七百架左右再度襲擊該島，擊落及擊毀十七架。二十四日及二十六日，並以大型機六十架來襲特魯克，二十五日以七架轟炸波那佩（擊落一架），以七十二架轟炸帛琉島（擊落五架擊毀二架），該方面敵機之活躍，係與迭尼安島及大宮島之推移相呼應，故實堪注目。</p>
<p>南太平洋方面之敵機，依然連續攻擊拉巴爾及加比恩，而新幾內亞西南地區，亦常有敵機出現，新幾內亞於二十一日至二十六日之間，轟炸馬諾卡利之敵機，共達一百數十架，而其他各處亦不時遭受空襲，亦常有敵方魚雷艇出現。班違海方面，二十六日於薩姆拉上空出現敵機二架，二十五日敵大型機曾來襲西蘇島西方巴爾島之那姆萊阿。北澳方面，七月中旬敵機來襲合計一百六十九架，而該方面敵機，亦屢次實施白晝轟炸。</p>
<p>印度洋方面，二十五日上午敵艦載機二十餘架，曾襲擊蘇門答臘島之薩邦，並以二十三架轟炸庫塔拉查查，同時敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦製艘，亦接近薩邦港外，而開始砲擊該地，嗣經日軍反擊後，已將來襲敵機之大部擊落，并擊沉敵驅逐艦二艘，潛水艦一艘，擊毀驅逐艦一艘，日軍損失極輕微。</p>
<h3>衡陽日軍　壓縮包圍圈　已佔領各重要設施</h3>
<p>湖南前綫某基地二十九日中央社電　包圍衡陽日軍，刻正壓縮包圍圈。衡陽外圈之渝軍重要設施，已全為日軍所佔領，除湘江之渝軍空軍重要基地衡陽機塲，已為日軍確保外，即衡陽西南之軍政部，食糧倉庫，西車站，湘桂鐵道衡陽電塲，及該市南方鋼鐵機械廠，汽車製造廠等，自七日以來，亦為南下日軍所佔據，故渝軍對衡陽之陸續補給，已全斷絕。</p>
<p>湖南前綫某基地二十九日中央社電　衡陽地區之大規模二重包圍戰，現已展開，日軍對衡陽之攻略，更置目標於殲滅渝野戰軍。渝軍仍擬糾合殘軍，企圖挽回衡陽之頹勢，遂關九十八師，百九十四師，百五十七師等，由南方及西方侵入日軍包圍綫內，即被分別殲滅，因之衡陽周圍，遂展開酣戰。蓋日軍南下部隊之一部，於二十七日將集結於毛栗坪（衡陽西十八里）渝第百九十四師，擊敗潰走。但渝軍復又潛入白馬塘，至二十四日夕刻，渝軍關於衡陽北方之竹水河畔構築陣地，但為日軍察覺，遂即痛擊之，渝軍受重創潰走。又追擊渝軍第百九十四師之日軍，突破渝軍中央部於二十一日晨進抵新橋，（衡陽西十五六里），與渝軍第六十二軍之一部相遇，現已對之攻擊中。另一部日軍，十九日擊潰進出於五塘（衡陽西十三公里）之渝第六十五軍之主力一部，日軍於二十一日夕抵達忠橋（衡陽西十公里），擊退當地渝軍第百五十一百五十七兩師，曾企圖襲擊日軍之背後，但日軍先發制人，大迂迴於鐵絲塘（衡陽西南八公里），對之猛攻。再者呼號奪回機塲而來之渝第六十五軍之一團，曾於二十三日集結於何家橋（衡陽南四公里），但遭日軍奇襲，完全被殲，另一方為奪取該機塲而來之渝軍約五百餘，於賀家園遭日軍急襲，亦全被殘滅，觀以上各情，知來援衡陽之渝軍，徒共日軍攻擊而已。薛岳軍損失亦確增大，渝第九戰區之崩潰，亦確可決定矣。</p>
<p>日軍正作最後攻擊</p>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據路透社重慶特派員二十八日訊，衡陽之戰况如次，重慶軍當局二十八日會見外國記者時宣稱，日軍對死守衡陽已歷三十三日之重慶電，刻正作最後之攻擊。日軍戰車隊已由長沙調至該地云。據重慶最近消息，日軍將修理長沙至衡山之公路，日軍戰車已出現衡陽北方，衡陽地區之戰事，目下市郊南部，西南部，西北部及東部，四面展開，日軍傾全力攻擊，舊街市內部現在死守該地，情勢危急，軍需皆由空中補給，其增援部隊企圖沿湘桂鐵道向衡陽移動，力謀由西南方與衡陽之守備部隊取得聯絡，前鋒已接觸日軍，開始激戰。重慶軍之增援部隊，僅有一次抵達距衡陽一公里半之地點，其後遭日軍猛烈之攻擊，即告退却。日軍目前等待北方增軍之戰車隊，及重砲隊，不久將出動大攻勢</p>
<h3>渝美機昨襲　鞍山及大連</h3>
<p>新京二十九日中央社電　日關東軍報道部二十九日下行四時發表：本日午十一時三十分，駐渝美空軍曾以B2型機數架來襲鞍山及大連，頃判明戰果，於鞍山上空擊落敵機一架，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>日本天理敎徒　從事煤增產</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日本天理敎敎會本部，為度煤之增產起見，中山管長及所屬九十名本部職員，三十日下午自奈良縣敎會本部出發赴九州三池煤田，領導全國該敎信徒一萬人，組織天理敎煤田義勇隊，從事增產。</p>
<h3>與盟國緊密携手向祖國印度邁進　鮑斯統帥披瀝作戰決心</h3>
<p>緬甸日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　印度國民軍統帥鮑斯氏，曾就此次日本內閣改組事談稱：余與杉山元帥，重光外相相識，唯小磯首相以次其他閣僚，則並未謀面，然吾印人對於綱羅日本第一流人物組成之新閣，立於全亞洲民族之地位，以最後勝利為目標，勇猛邁進者，頗為欣慰，吾等承蒙東條前內閣首相，於公私兩面之種支援，於茲謹表謝意云云。又當茲緬甸獨立一周年八月一日之際，鮑斯氏特於二十七日發表談話如次：敵軍無論如何反攻，吾人絕不為之微動驚駭，勝敗乃戰爭常事，無論如何困難，適足鞏固吾等軸心國民之決意，爭取最後勝利，東亞印人目覩印緬綫形勢，傾盡家財，充為國孩獻金者，頗不乏人，志願義勇軍者，亦逐漸增加，擊减敵人之意氣，刻已愈益高昂，印度國民軍為數雖少，然此不成問題，吾等唯有向祖國邁進，以自己之鮮血，染紅印度之獨立旗幟，且後繼部隊，相信將必隨我而來。印緬戰綫迄今日軍常行率先前進，然現在吾等印度國民軍之戰塲訓練，業已完成死之覺悟，現在實為吾等於日軍之先，前進之時期云。最後鮑斯統帥以談話開工，書其所信如次：敵美英於連續慘敗後，最近其反攻，始稍見成功，彼等刻正以此等小成功，而誇大宣傳，但我人亦不能小評價，此種反攻，適足使吾等一戰到底獲勝為止之鐵石意志，更為堅强，此非僅一億日本國民如此，刻以美英為對手，而毅然奮鬥之亞洲民族，均具有此種堅强決心。美英兩國，皆為印度國民不共戴天之仇敵，故無論於如何狀態之下，吾等始終與日本以及其同盟國，緊密携手，鼎力以赴，余於茲願再表示吾等之決意，印度在現在只有一種標語，此即勝利滅敵是已。</p>
<h3>日外相報告　國際情勢</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日本二十八日之定例閣議，上午十時在首相官邸舉行，小磯首相以下全體閣僚均出席，首由大違內相詳細說明關於獎勵外地曾產米穀，提供米穀之特別措置案，當即通過。纔由杉山陸相，米內海相共同發言，大意謂為適應決戰階段情勢，切望陸·海兩軍，對於政府今後所採政策，一致强力推進，下午一時三十分休息，二時再行開會，由重光外相報告最近國際情勢，嗣則決定文部省次官等人事，下午三時散會。</p>
<h3>爪哇中參院　定下月開會</h3>

<h3>印督華維爾　拒接見甘地</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　甘地翁自出獄後，即提倡回印兩敎調協案，其後復提議組織印度國民政府，並曾要求會見印督華維爾。據新積里黨傳，印總督頃答覆甘地稱，徽諾貴翁並無任何新事態發生，故無理由與閣下會見。</p>

<h3>德適應戰時環境　推進總動員計劃　喚起人民為國族前途舊鬥</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德關為適應戰時環境而實行總力動員，已有若干初步措施準備完畢。例如城市中之郵左，每日遞信喊為二次，村中則减為每週一次。郭培爾與其屬下，分為設計委員會與執行委負會，一部工作之進行，至為緊張而順利，其爾標在以國內駐軍調往前綫，再自各業抽調壯丁，使成國內坊軍，然後再以與戰寥寶關餓要各業之男女工作人員，補充前項工業內缺少之人工。受上項變動之影響者，何止數百萬人，婦女服役年齡之限度，已自四十五歲延長為五十矯歲，且擴英國婦女服役年齡之限度猶少五盡。醫師今後發病假證書，該訪嚴格，甚至文化方面亦將受有限制，惟料娛樂事業當不教完全販消。總之當局之措施，依事實之需要，決無非必耍之限制，常局即將再度　表申明，喚起人民自動合作。</p>
<h3>反軸心各國舉行　「貨幣金融會議」　英美抱有操縱世界貨幣陰謀</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　反軸心各磯，自本月十一臼至二十四日止，曾以英美為中心，在美國布里敦森林，召開所課「貨幣金融會議」，參加者雖包括渙洲，南非，印度及渝方，法民族解放委員會，波蘭流亡政府等等號稱四十四國，會議其戰後世界經濟問題，一若戰事業已結束，而可作粉飾太平之想，是會中立國如阿很廷。土汗其。端士。葡萄牙等江均不其在到，其不足以見信于世界，固已無待贅言，而其為英。美企羅用為宰割世界之工具者，尤至為顯然。溯自前年夏秋以來，反勁心各國，即侈談其戰後世界建設問題，尤其美國方面，官方與弗官方之發表，對於教穢建設意見老，更屢見不鮮。揆其用意，無菲放作目價，有意粒人。其中更可笑而可憐者，即輸方之一部親英美份子，竟亦附和，形成英灸之應聲虫，而猶沾沾自醜，在此次所謂「貨伶金融會議」中，渝方尤顯已成為英美之附席。至其她被邀參加之各小國，乃至各流亡政府，更僅見助壯聲勢之小士卒。而綜觀此次會該之經過，更可證明英芙確有制霸世界之野心，尤其美噸且已利用其財富，而達成其壟倒英國之夙望。茲姑不問其會議之僅為紙上談兵，抑為夢之幻惡，試就共經過而稍作檢討，即可以見反軸心國所謂「戰後社界建設」計劃之一端。</p>
<p>計此次反軸心開之貨幣金融會議，前穢歷時週錄，時問不可謂不長，但結果所通過提案中之主要者，為設立國際建設銀行與開發銀行。該兩銀行計劃中之詳細內容，雖尚未明暸，惟徵賭歷史之教訓，則又顯為英美之</p>
<p>御用組織</p>
<p>而為英美用以侵略世界市場，換取各闔金錢之註册磯關。至其所謂穩定國際匯兌，而沒記之平準基金一事，更足為充分暴露英美之毒辣手段。蓋此項平準基金之總額，預定為八十入萬萬美元，但其中美驥竟獨佔百分之三十以上，而認繳二十七萬萬五千萬美元。英國則為十三萬萬美元，而佔百分之十五弱，故英美爾闔欲操縱世界貨幣之陰諜，昭然若揭。是以傳聞各國在認繳此項基金數額時，曾發餃重爭執之說，要非無因。據濺中央社布里敦森林二十三日電，亦會指出參加各崁均希望獲得蛟大之派繳，然基金數額，至為有限決云。故首即有印度代表對於國際隴發平準基金派額之不平，擊白表示</p>
<p>極度不滿</p>
<p>蓋印度在此八十入萬萬美元，僅被派認繳四萬萬美元，故其不滿乃屬然。於此而再觀渝方在此會議中之情形，則尤足以顯示渝方已甘心為英美之附柑。先以被派認之基金而言，則渝方伐為五英萬五干萬英美元，佔總數百分之六强，以視英美兩國之幾獨鱗百分之五十，其差別直如　壤。（一）再就所謂國際建設銀行再開發銀行言，此其性質固無異于昔日英國侵略印度之東印度公司。濺方參加該項會議之代表孔祥熙，竟公然表禾謂：余（孔自稱）堅信中國經濟上之强大，當為維持和平及改善世界福利之必要條件，久已為人夢想所及之。</p>
<p>中國巿塲</p>
<p>余信常戰後四億顧客之解買力提高時，必能成為事實云云。此種無恥言諭，亦惟無恥如孔祥假始能出此。　茲且不問中國經濟力之强大，覺眞能為維持和平，及改善世界福利之必要條件。但即據孔之所言而觀，一方間可知餓方之欲以自身謀開發中國，而一方圾欲公然出賣中闔市場，甘使中國永淪於</p>
<p>次殖民地</p>
<p>經濟而無法自拔。是放孔之貫論，不僅為孔個人之活不知恥，實為足以見渝方觀英美派份子之喪心病狂。而孔在會議開幕前接見渝中央社記者時，竟謂渝方為故勞各國計，已奪此次會議中，從事「讓步「與「犧性」，是孔之慷國家乏慨，實堪痛心。革於美國代表團之發言人，以及其他與會各國，均予公開承認，幷謂渝方對於美國政府及人民有一歡特殊之友誼云云。孔之出賣和國，與獻媚美國之卑媚醜態，已暴露無遺。於此而為猶欲期渝方之能使中磯獨立自主，是試不奮知人說夢。雖然以上所述，僅為好大自誇之英美所主演之一幕喜劇，於吾人之信念，固不能稍損毫末也。</p>
<h3>實驗縣長人選　決愼重考慮</h3>

<h3>印度解放的黎明　上原虎重　崩潰中的英國統治</h3>
<p>壽長，而恥辱多，抑篌侮多，固麗因人而異，但人所共肩者，乃壽長，而見聞多之一點，日本軍隊幫助印度人所編成的祖國解放軍，而由國外緬旬，向印度勢如破竹的進軍，這一點是否有人當作現實問題，而考慮過麼？英美在遠東的任意宰割，誰都知護，這是具有悠久歷史的。「決計解姣東亞的同族近親，而剷除英美的桎梏」，這種思想在日本人的心坎上，業已不是一朝一夕的時問了。我們日本人的前輩中，對於這一點發揮宏諭者，早已數見不鮮。像筆者這楞人也來參加意見，實在有點有夠資格，而是答答大孤每日新開社海外留學生試題「日華印三國同盟論」的。</p>
<p>然而這是否現實問題或實際問題呢？不是的。而是理想，是幻想，是「夢囈」。從世界大局看，從東亞大衆看，都除此而外沒有其他辦法。假如盎格魯撒克遜民族及其背後牽錢的猶太民族是眞正賢明鈞話，則口木人這個「夢囈」或許永久不能兌現了，然而貪婪成性及輕視世界的他們——儘管購族中的開明之士諾界，銀哲爾等一再警告——曾發動起第一次瞰界大戰。因此而破壞了世界勢力的均衡。自然，包括日本的東亞，也受到均勢破壞的莫大影饗。於是對於上次大戰至此次大戰的歷史足跡，是不能不管的，總之，此次大戰是上次大戰必然的歸趨，在這一點上，而有不可比擬的差聯。即由「均勢破壞」而展開「世界新秩序」。</p>
<p>於是，「夢藝」就為現實。大東亞戰爭的積極性意義，就在於此。同時從未有過的事情，日本人作了，這種高興實在是無法形容。如壽長，則見聞多，我固然年齡尙有待，但所碰到的事情，則不能不使我驚訝黍頌。勉强生活到今天的我，不能不說是幸福。</p>
<p>讀者看到我這樣妄自稱幸，或許認為是一件滑稽事。但這也是有理由的。</p>
<p>現在的高興對於前此的悲痛來說，可以說是一種反映。過去是怎樣悲痛來呢？</p>
<p>印度的悲哀</p>
<p>一年實習期間終了的我，於一九一八年夏，盡量抑制着無限的希望，而對孟買去了。古來稱作西天拜佛南天限經，現在我是為了觀察和研究印度人有血有肉的國權運動而來的。然而使我大失所望。我逗奮印度的期間，是從一九一八年夏起至一九二〇年春止的。那正是一個緊張時期。在歐洲因停戰而舉行和平會議。在郎度則由自洽制度而實現新刑法，逮捕甘地，終而釋放，巴克對民衆的大屠殺，實施自治制度（？）等等的重大事件，層出不窮。同時，關於阿富汗王哈比布拉汗的被暗殺，終於引起英印對阿富汗的戰爭，於是我這樣年靑記者，才能得到充滿刺激的生活。然而我研究印度國袱運動本身的第一個目的，只有使我大失所望。</p>
<p>印度到何處去？是到處不通的。我所得到的結論就是如此。甘地是聖雄，這一點是無容置疑的，甚至我一直到今天，仍然衷心崇拜他，而且五體投地地讀着他的偉大著作。何以要讀他的書？圾為他的書並非是閉門造車，而是非常實際的，用數學來鏡，全見四則之類的實際論。這樣主張之不能實行，自然還並非甘地的罪過。然而事實上未曾實行，這究竟是怎發一回事？</p>
<p>白樂天問曰：「佛教之大意如何？」</p>
<p>烏窠禪師答曰：「諸惡勿作，衆善宜行。</p>
<p>「如此之事，人所共知。」</p>
<p>「三歲童子雖知，而縱入十老翁亦難行也。」</p>
<p>因此道理就可以鴻白了。駕羹甘地所提倡的「把握眞理」主張，就是與「諸惡勿作，衆善宜行」的道理，具有同樣意義，而是一般人所不能全作到的。虞是一個悲劇。印度人多半好高驚遠，而不能實行，這是英鸛人所不能瞭解的。英國人只相信武力，除此之外，任何眞理是無緣鈞。所以即度人本身以為現在的處境，是由於自己的無德，或是由於前世罪孽之報應，假如實行離戒沐浴，而列隊遊行，則英人觀為這是「禾威」。如果風傳「印度不靖」，則英人必間「印度人的武裝何來？」印度和英國的鬥爭，完全是不對等的比賽。</p>
<p>印度的國權運動，究竟能達到如何堆步，教眞是不敢妄加揣測。雖然如此，但看到印度人的苦鬥，而一天一天地墾公，逐漸痛定恩痛，令人鬢指。西洋人稱僑居他國為「吃該國的靈」。這樣說來，我該算是吃過好多國家觀的人，然而並未吃遴印度的「悲痛鹽」。印度普通用的鹽，並非是印度出產的鹽，而是非洲東北端出產的靈。即度的海岸錢雖長，但玲度人並不從印度洋的海水中取鹽。還是什麼道理呢？因為蘭克夏棉業公司不許可。英國從印度輸入的棉花公與英璘向印度輸掛的棉布量，為八比一。英國因為運輸船的不均衡，所以就從印度載棉花，向印度則裝菲洲的艱，以作調整。但由於在即度實行食鴃專賣，於是受苦者乃普通人民大衆。因為普通人民的調味物，只是噸。晚年甘地倡言製鹽遝動，荔被拘禁，道並非是為印度食應的自足自給。而是象級駭逐英帝國主義的意思，即不要吃英國鹽。</p>
<p>夢囈也將成為事實</p>
<p>我失望而坐船別離印度了。是想對英饑觀察印度的國繼運動去。船是陸地的縮影。往昔對離度去的帆船（Indiaman）上，仍然殘留着假冒为善的英国人的卑鄙淫海上生活。然而更使鞏永久不能忘記老，却是訣仄的輪船上所展開的印英兩大民放的對立情形。船上唯一日本人的我，當時便處擠微妙的立塲上了，坐船的頭一天，印度人就斷定了我的身世，在英國人和亞洲人分為兩個練營的食堂裏，我的座位則由他們來決定了。</p>
<p>英國人以陰險的手段，嗾使印度教徒和回教徒互相傾機，且大事寥傳兩種教徒是具有不共戴天的世仇的。事寶決非如此。實際上兩種敎徒是非常丰亲相爱的。在船上也是如此的。在一羣印度人的位置上曾坐着一位購激捷名呌委哈馬殲的人，誰都沒有異議。而我和一個尼泊爾人坐在摩哈馬欐的兩傍。都對放我這儷外國人以及尼泊爾這個異鄉人，表禾敬靂。離洲人陣營比較英國人劉營，遠為親魯。希望當律師的麼哈馬德，談笑風生，充分表示菁座長的神氣，但並非是什麼了不起的人物。引起我注意者，並非他，而是他的弟弟薩蒂·應哈馬德。薩蒂的確是一位有為靑年。他與希望當律師的脊哥有絕大的不同點，而是渡英硏究應用化學這樣實學的·喜觀滔滔不斷辯論的哥哥在甲板上手不釋卷地讀囂俄的著作，但薩蒂一有時間，則看回教的聖典可蘭經。眞是虔誠而篤信的一位胥年。我們在到達倫敦之前，曾和他行動一致，甚到在倫敦也曾相互往來。</p>
<p>但薩蒂眞不幸，無論那一俱學稜都不龍進去。英國人雖然不怕醫生和律師，但對於印度人研究應用化學，則相當不高興。因為不願印度人曉得近代工業的秘密。薩蒂大失所望而又赴美國去。後來怎樣我雖然不知道，但假定在美國能學到自巴願意學的課程，則歸國後如再發見英雄無用武之地，仍然還會大失所望的。</p>
<p>英國人為使印度人不具有獨立國民的實力，而這樣用心周到。雖然印類人處在這樣非常不利的環境裹，但反對芙國的鬥爭仍然在繼績借。上一次大戰至此次歌洲大戰的二十年間，即所謂鬥印度不靖」的二十年。流血事件也曾不少。雖然如此，但印度的礬權運動尚未看到絲毫邊際。無論在印度看還種運動也好，在英國看也好，就必然得出一個結論來，即度的獨立是不可能的。然而火東煎戰爭爆發，則形勢完全一變。印度獨立這一夢囈，業已進入實現的過程，。這實在是一件令人歌頌的事。（未完）（季譯自邇月二十三日週刊　日）</p>

<h3>社會保險局昨舉行　週年紀念茶會　並展覽保險圖表及照片</h3>
<p>社會福利部社會保險局成立以來，瞬已一　，所推行強制勞動保險，已在本市普遍展開，該局爲使各界明瞭舉辦社會保險業務狀況起見，特於昨日下午五時，假泰興路　都花園舉行週年紀念茶會，招待本市各界領袖，曁各投保工廠業主。社會福利部丁部長，並親臨致訓，茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>茶會情形</p>
<p>丁社會福利部長準時躬親參與，並到該局局長黃香谷，秘書周樹望，處長郭叔亮，專門委員潘鼎元，徐裕昆，及諸有關當局長官，來賓林康侯，孫鳴岐，顧網武，袁　昌，吳文蔚，陳東白，周毓英，張克昌，胡壽祺，李時雨，郭順，項康元，凌大挺，吳桓如，陳彬　等，曁各廠商代表不下數百餘名，市府特派代表凌　文氏出席。全體在　樂高秦聲中，行禮如儀　，即由黃局長主席致詞，後由來賓林康侯，袁　昌，　紹衡，秦益洲等相　演說，至下午七時後始告禮成散會。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>黃局長　各主席致開會詞，略謂今天是本局推行業務週年紀念，得承各界來賓曁各業領袖光臨，本人覺得非常欣幸，社會保險在我國是一種新政，其目的在增進國民健康，安　定勞工生活，過去一年來承各產業界多方協助，社會保險業務已在本市普　展開，截至目前止，投保工廠，已有二○六五家，被保險人五七七六○人，對保險業務各項設施情形，已　明本日申報及平報社會保險特輯一　，並在場備有各種統計圖表，本人可不必再述，唯希望在座各界，予以充分指教外，並望今後仍　過去熱忱，繼續協力，俾社會保險制度，得在我國永久普遍樹立，　是本人所盼望的。</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>開會詞畢，即恭請丁部長致訓詞，略謂社會保險，爲社會福利事業之一種，亦爲國家實施社會政策必要之措施，近代世界莫不一致推行，在社會保險制度未確立前，社會的意外災害，只有　　　家的救濟，僅限於消　方面的　生救死，所收效果有限，社會保險則不然，它具有增進國民健康，安定勞工生活，藉以解決現實社會　　的積極作用，因爲社會保險最重要性質是「大數法則」去救濟各個勞動者的意外損害，就是由業主爲其被　者各納少量的保險書，外有政府的津貼補助，　合起來　成一筆極大的款項，勞動者　有疾病傷害　　死亡外等意外事故發生時，就依其災害的程度，分別貼償其損失。這樣勞動者意外負担得以減少，或免除，生活就得安定。生活既經安定，工作效力，勞資情感，自然增進，對於增加生產，亦自然努力以赴。且近年來赤共潛伏活動，每利用工人智識　　，生活艱苦，　機施其　惑手段，設　　成工潮，尤足影響治安，故社會保險設施，於　方及國家社會均有　益。社會福利部，除推行一般勞工福利事業外，後設　社會保險局，主辦該項保險，其目的亦即在此。該局在上海推行強制勞動保險以來，瞬已一載。一年來本市產業界均能與政府合作，推行　時社會政策，已見今日之成效，本人感到非常欣慰。惟尚有數點希望各界深切了解：即　目前有少數人以爲社會保險局所收保險費，全部用於勞工，其給付情形，已見今日申平兩報，與普通捐稅性質截然兩樣。　社會保險所以要實行強制，便是要增進國民健康，安定勞工生活之普遍　效，我們有一個　喻，就是與衛生當局強制市民防疫注射的意義一樣，當局費了極大的經費，爲市民注射，爲的是市民的康健，所以這樣的強制，同樣是出於善意的。今天是社會保險局推行業務週年紀念，目前被保險人已達五萬七千餘人，今後希望產業界　續協力推行，使這種事業，能夠更普遍的展開，以完成政府推行社會政策的使命。</p>
<p>凌處長詞</p>
<p>市府代表凌處長詞略謂：社會福利部成立社會保險局，爲推行勞動保險以來迄已一載，方才丁部長對該局目的及工作，闡述頗詳，而市府方面對此亦頗　切重視。查上海爲工商業　萃之區，工廠林立，過去一般工廠對勞動保障過少，雖市府第一區公署對工業福利及勞工福利，亦加舉辦，惟多因經費等種種關係，未得完成理想之目的。今社會福利部旣設局推行保險局務，故嘉　本市工廠業，實非淺　。經一年來之工作，日見各方之殷切需要，在事實上，社會保險收獲頗大效果，已奠定相當之基礎，如今上海勞工方面之生產頗薄，希望今後繼續發揚局務，爲社會一般職業者謀福利，市府方面對此深爲期望。</p>
<p>圖表展覽</p>
<p>該局除舉行年紀念典禮，及招待各界外，并將社會保險行政設施狀況，　繪成圖表，或攝製照片，公開展覽，最主要者計有投保工廠，業別及被保人統計，保險費收入統計，保險人及被保險人平均負擔統計，醫療統計，給付統計，業務費支出比較，重要疾病治療經過攝影，殘廢生產及傷害比較，藥費數字統計等四十餘種，並由中華聯合影片公司，派員到場攝取各新聞片，俾對社會保險事業作普遍之實傳。</p>
<h3>當局準備增加　戶口米配給量　米糧入口較前暢旺</h3>
<p>本市米價日來急據跌落，雜糧價格亦見低下，本市米價低落之主要原因，　爲市府當局撤廢關於米糧之各種限制，是以米糧入口較前暢旺，本月上旬爲二萬六千一百四十一担，中旬爲三萬三千九百五十二担，下旬亦達二萬担以上，因來源增多，存貨充沛，本市米價遂跌落達三成以上。</p>
<p>至於產米地區新米即將登場，且有豐收希望，農民紛紛將存米拋售，米價更見低賤，南京一帶粳米每石僅值三千八百元，　湖一帶每石尚不滿二千元，自盟軍湖南作戰節節勝利，新佔領區均爲該省產米之地，如洞庭湖四週及湘資沅　下流諸縣，每年米　輸出量在五六萬石以上，岳陽，長沙亦爲產米要區，該區米糧大部分即可運來上海，故上海米價，有　益跌落之可能。</p>
<p>以麥產量而言華北一帶本年亦極豐收，河北省去年每畝收獲量平均爲一百十八斤左右，本年可達一百五十四斤，河南省去年每畝收獲量平均爲一百斤左右，本年可達一百四十餘斤。綜觀以上各項情形，本年全國米麥產量增加運輸暢達，米麥價格，均可望大爲跌落，本市米糧自亦不至匱乏，聞市政當局，已有增加戶口米配給數量之準備，一切具體計劃，正與有關方面協議進行，不日實施後，將一掃民食米之不安狀態，各方對此咸熱切期待。</p>
<h3>財局機構　呈府待核</h3>
<p>市政當局爲促成市政統一，決定於八月一日將各重要機構，遷　於江西路第一區公署內，市財政局方面，亦奉令於八月二十九日遷往一區指定地點，至其遷移之機構問題，頃據記者向負責方面獲悉，除秘書室外，該局將分設總務·賦稅·征收·主計·特稅等五科，掌理各項事務，以及原有會計室之設置與否，將視市府總會計處之組織而定，該局已呈市府待核中。</p>
<h3>特種配給粉　價格將提高　戶口粉價格維持原狀</h3>
<p>粉麥統制委員會上海區粉遷統配處自成立以來，對於市區　粉　給事宜，愼密辦理，成績良好，輔佐民食良益匪淺。茲悉該處　於米糧價格高昂，爲減輕平民生活負重起見，經會商確定，對於戶口粉配給價格維持原狀，決不提高。此外各業特種粉配給，除增加配給數量外，並將配粉業別分別二等級，對於平民化之大餅油條粥業等配粉價格分爲二等，其高貴食品業之配粉價格分爲一等，較戶口粉配給價格提高百分之四十至五十，下月中即可實施。</p>
<h3>食糖配給發購買證</h3>
<p>上海糖商合作營業處，爲通告特一組用戶（即前乙種零售商）換領購買證，特發通告云：「查本處第二十三期特配食糖，業經配給就緒，除特二組用戶，係以通知書通知外，所有特一組用戶（即前乙種零售商）仍須依照向例，來處換領購買證。茲定於七月三十一日八月一日兩天　，發給購買證，希各該用戶，在此限期內，將上次紅色批售書，背面蓋用店印，持來換領　買證，並限於八月三日以前，向指定糖行繳淸貨款，隨即出貨，倘不依限來領購證，或已領購買證而不依　繳淸貨款者，即認爲自動放棄，予以取銷配　，特此通告」。</p>
<h3>南市將配孕婦赤糖</h3>
<p>赤砂糖爲孕婦所必需，第一區方面自經開始發售以來，孕婦莫不稱便，茲據記者探悉，糖商合作營業處爲解除南市區內孕婦需糖之　　起見，決予實施按口配給，在市糧食局指示之下，南市全區，即將開始發售，聞每一孕婦得購取是項赤砂糖二市斤，每斤計售中　券一百元，另購申請紙一張，並須聯保長藍　及黏貼申請人照片，藉以防杜流幣。</p>
<h3>車登記　禁非法取費</h3>
<p>本市公用局辦理車輛登記，歷經嚴禁經辦人員浮收　款，自六月份起所有登記費用，槪歸財政局統收，該局不再直接收取，界限益見分明，近以脚踏車掉照開如辦理，該局特再於日昨通令各登記處所，切實告　，如有非法取費，定予嚴懲不貸。</p>
<h3>黃浦區舉行　防空演習</h3>
<p>黃浦分局於昨（二十九）日上午十一時，在四川路九江路口舉行大規模防空演習，由該分局長小林　三郎，副分局長劉亞英，曁駐軍長官等親臨指揮，第一聯保自　團及附近各大廈特別自　團等，均參加訓練，分別舉行　彈救火，救護，避難，等各項防空必要措置之演習，並用鞭炮作追假想炸彈，演來頗爲逼眞熟純，至十二時許始告完畢。嗣後對是項防空演習，將隨時舉行，以期熟練而防萬一之件事發生。</p>
<h3>警局將舉行　復興節茶會</h3>
<p>八月一日復興節，本市各界均熱烈慶祝，第一警察料爲表示慶祝起見，於是日上午十時在該局七樓警察俱樂部舉行茶會，副分局長副科長以上高級員警，均須參與，屆時將由陳　局長躬臨致訓。</p>
<h3>防疫注射統計</h3>
<p>當本市第二期防疫注射即將展開之　，記者特於昨（二十九）日訪問關於第一期本市各區防疫注射成績，承告如次，據各區注射隊報　告，自五月一日至七月二十日，市民受注射者，數達一四四三一二三人。</p>

<h3>短評　戰時社會政策之重要</h3>
<p>社會福利部社會保險局，昨天舉行成立週年紀念會，本報且爲酌　篇幅，刊載「社會保險特輯」，以期對此社會事　，喚起各界注意，尤其是產業界的注意。我們讀了該局一年來之工作報告，可以明瞭強制勞動保險的意義，以及對於勞動者之和　保　。</p>
<p>社會保險在我國尚屬創舉，舉辦之初，工廠業主對「強制勞動保險」的「強制」，難免發生直覺上的不盡信任，投保寥寥。嗣後該局對於被保險人充分履行保險義務，在工作上有了良好表現以後，漸漸引起工廠業主的注意和信任，投保數目逐月　　。可是，從全市估計而言，投保工廠雖已佔二分之一強，而投保人數僅佔三十分之一，顯然未能完成社會保險之目的。於此，我們一面期待該局進一步在工作上表現成績，更使產業界瞭解與信任；一面希望產業界爲安定勞工生活，自動參加投保，以期明年今日，每一勞動者都是被保險人。</p>
<p>時國家，爲安定社會秩序，增加社會力量，社會政策必須推行，同時，頗有會政策更可說是政府對於人民的一種義務，是積極的增強國力，而不是消極的施民恩澤。政府以這樣眼光推行社會政策，人民以這樣眼光協力社會政策的推行，社會安定，國家復興，自能獲得很好的成效。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息　關於試題難度之說明</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金辦事處日來接到申請學生家長來函多件，以本屆考試試題有爲學生從未學過者，要來從寬批分，俾可合格。按本屆考試命題之前，辦事處會公開向各校徵求試題，並承多數學校合作，送來試題參考。惟以本屆申請學生已經各校當局及辦事處一度審查，准予登記及參加考試者俱屬各校優秀份子，試題難度故意予以提高，俾可選出優秀份子中之特別優秀者。</p>
<p>且本屆命題取材廣泛，每套試題數目皆在一百以上，有爲二級學生所通用者，一部份試題自以較高年級爲標準，並不希望較低一級學生之大多數能作答。但兩級試題雖同，成績及格之標準自異。如以初中二年生因未習代數而認爲「自難合格」，未免過慮。若不需應用代數之數學題能做對其大部份，其餘各學科之成績亦在平均以上，則雖代數題完全不做，仍有錄取之希望也。</p>
<p>請各校通知收費數目</p>

<h3>科學技術座談會</h3>
<p>科學技術生產三位一體作業</p>
<p>稻村：此外還有一個問題，即日本的　術和科學，是和生產不相連　的東西，而全是從外國移植來的。所以我們日本士科方面的人的所研究者，是外國的技術和有關的大學研究，而科學方面的人，所研究者，是直接　法外國的科學。其對於日本產葉本身，是沒有收獲列軍需產　所必要的技術研究上之大學成績，同時是沒有把大學基礎的科學發生有機的聯　，是未造成科學。技術，生產三位一體的作　。如想完成這一點，則需要由工場和統制會方面加以　旋。然後與技術家聯　起來。把技術家所感覺到的問題，提交給科學家集團。這樣一個有機聯　的研究方式，或許就是科學技術戰力化的基本。</p>
<p>大　：我想這是很重要的問題。科學家鑽入象牙之塔，而從事與現實經騐相脫離的研究，而生產機　無論碰到什麼困難，也不從事科學分析，這樣兩方面都毫無益處。德國甚至動員數學家到生產機關去，所以　輪的理論也非常發達，而生產機關的出品也非常好。蘇聯當建立生　計劃時，則動員科學家，而由科學家的見地來估計一個工場的技術可能生產力。</p>
<p>記者：方才所說的問題，工場自工場，研究室自研究室。這樣的現象，或許會逐漸解消吧！</p>
<p>花田：去年文部省開始命令理工科學生到工場去，而使學生盡量從事工場實習。然而並不是像以前一樣，爲實習到工場去，而到工場去勞動才是實習。這是　時的非常　　，如能進行流通澈底，則現在的所謂學者和工場間的距離，就會逐漸削除。所以畢業的學生，都完全知道工場之爲物，還是非常好的現象，我們是在　香祈　著一件事。</p>
<p>方才稻村先生所說的各方面的人才，在日本也如能　除界綫，打成一片，則會成爲一個好現象。</p>
<p>稻村：我們站在教育的立場上說，此次動員學生是非常好的一件事。理工科學生甚至停止上課，讓要工場服務一年或二年後再受教育，就像德　，美國，荷蘭等各國的工業教育一樣，凡想當工科大學的學生者，必先在生產機關內受一年或二年的實際教育，如是方能實現科學。技術。生產三位一體的作　。</p>
<p>：　此從理論方面來看實際生產，總是格格不入。　　現實問題而加以理論上的檢討，則比較會容易走上正確的方向。</p>
<p>稻村：那樣教育就成爲話的</p>
<p>花田：最担心的，就是一入工場，就會担心不能從事普遍的各方面教育。然而我並不以爲然。假令一個大學生也打棒球，也打網球，也學　劍，也學柔道，而全都是一知半解，這樣的一個人如　照會擊劍，而有五段資格者，遇事時，仍然　是擊劍者有用。　是因爲精通所致。同樣道理，工場實習也是一樣，無論怎樣偏於工場實習，都好，在工場中只一件事，不要落後於人就可以了。所以我說，無論怎樣偏於一件事，都可以。</p>
<p>稻村：至於此次理工科學生參加生產，而服務於電報方面的技師說，會收到很好的成績。都說工科學生的供獻是不可限量的。</p>
<p>科學技術的迫切任務</p>
<p>記者：方才業已領教過，例如科學技術的戰力化問題，固然對於國家施策十分好，且非常使我們膽壯，但科學技術當戰力化時，是否有障礙發生呢？</p>
<p>稻村：經濟方面如何需要研究，　　　百尺　頭　進一步的現解。理由就是目前的戰爭，如不從事什麼研究也可以。業已知道的東西，宜加以源源不斷地反對黨量生產。這一點是很重要的。尤其正當此次決戰的非常時期，如能這樣勇往直前地作去，則對經濟方面定有莫大供獻。然而此次戰爭，尤其是德蘇戰爭，是在等待著一種科學技術完成新的進步後，而進行作戰的。爲了進行一　作　，爲了進行一個戰鬥，一定等待某種新兵器或某種新武器完成時，即材料的進步，或一種機械的進步，往往使戰爭致勝，所以就應當知道，研究和有計劃的技術研究，是如何的重要，研究是左右我們民族靈魂的。</p>
<p>藤：方才曾講過德國的實例。德國和蘇聯，工業技術家甚至全體人員的六七成。此外德國方面，在研究　作工場（即工場）的技術家，在研究室的技術家，佔全體技術家的過半數。然而在這樣研究試作　　，卻完全　考慮到製造工程，而爲了達到一直能　正生產時爲止，技術家才能算結束自己的工作。在工場　只有生產技術家，即轉交到工場去就可以，因工場中不需要多人也可以順利進行的。然而研究試作室如與工場脫離，則不會收到好的結果。如　正具有工場中一切出乎其類　乎其萃的條件，能在現實上生產化，　技術上能運用的經騐家所創造出來的東西，則一定很美滿。如不注力於這方面的研究，對於此次戰爭，是不敢說有把握的。敵人的兵器能力，也應確實知道。爲了對於這一點，如不製作出更形有利的武器，將落後於次一個戰鬥的場合，則迅速交與研究室，這樣或許不能在短期內解決。全國如沒有相當的研究技術家，則全部拿到工場去的研究試作，就不會有，於是大的戰爭就不可能應付。</p>
<p>記者：費了諸位很多　　光陰，問題也都談完了，所以就此散會。（完）（季譯自四月號日本評論）</p>

<h3>當前糧食聞題對</h3>
<p>— 张逢鋒</p>
<p>「民爲邦本，本固而邦甯」，固本之術不一端，惟首在安定民生焉。安定民生其衛办多，然人人不可少，天天不可少者糧食耳，古来即承認「民以食爲大」，則重視糧食不自今日始，即總理著民更主義，開宗明義便談吃飯問題，尤足徵信糧食之不可或少，吃飯是每人每天應有的重要問題，故安定民生之第一要術　予民以食莫屬此在平時爲確論，若在戰時爲尤然，　戰時爲賴民食無虞始足安爾後方而由後軍輪下軍糧，後方不亂乃得免前輩之亂，　之歷史事實，第一次歐戰德軍軍體並未崩潰本可支持危局，尚有最後決以獲勝之希望，卒以糧食恐慌引起國內革命，牵動前方軍隊，使軍隊不得不退，終致於休戰　和；其時已有糧食統制之端倪，粗具辦法，若今次戰中則各國更厲行糧食統制政策，亦足覓戰時糧食之尤爲重要，實爲世界國全民不易之公論。</p>
<p>我國執行糧食統制亦已有素，惟隨時事之推演，糧價不免上漲，尤以今春以來漲風尤熾，以　　最迫切之米論，在上海第一度先漲至每石六千元左右，後回至四千元左右無跌，入夏以来第二度上漲竟超過一萬元在最近二旬以前曾至一萬三千元之最高脊，經此二旬間之有效措施始稍回跌，惟仍在九千元左右徘徊，以九千元視去冬之二子元相差仍　，不過人受速上漲之刺激後稍有回跌，已視若　事，實則米爲一切糧食之領導，且可左右其他物價，現仍保持幾近每石萬元之　，則在整個民食及日常生活之購買說來，民生方面算已有嚴重之糧食問題。</p>
<p>爲當務之急，　　現前糧食問題之對策自有其必要焉，容國民公論之。</p>
<p>①統購統買</p>
<p>過去糧食統政之得失利弊容不　論，茲所論者袛及管見所及認為有實施必要之對　。其一即爲統購統買。此云者則　由政府統　組織廣泛地直按向產地生產者平價採購全般糧食賢料，所謂全般糧食資料即除米外尚　包括其他六　類及豆菽類，塊　類，塊根類食料，輸至各地公　糧備之，然後本分配的社會化之原則，按戶口定期需要量配　舆　戶。此乃一原則，其利在一，能澈底消減糧商囤積，抛價壟斷，二，減少其中間不勞而獲之囘傭，三，人民各　平價糧之利，貧者不致再似以前無整欵購備糧食致在上漲過程中蒙受逐次零購不懈不吃高價糧之損，至其實施過程丕妨由政府酌查產地情形，定出一般糧食資料之公價，委託所在地糧食商行必要時予以貸金爲政府購儲之，然後由政府加予相當合法利潤向各該商行搬貨之，若曾子貸金者則扣除貸金本息。此項採購之糧輸至公倉地點積儲之，同時大宗配賣輿各地糧食商店，由店按戶口購糧登記配賣與各　戶，其賣價應依統制組織所規定，規定時亦酌加應得合法利潤。如此實施　有三利：一，不致變動原來商業體系，二，維持糧商之存在，不過予以合法應得利潤，三，減少統制組織之辦事人員藉節公支。可節約之一者。我國消費於　之　造之米。　爲量實甚鉅，與其民貪尚憂不足，不如節此無謂消費以裕必須之民食．故今後請政府效節電·節煤（生產動力要素尚且節之）之法，則使保存　造　，亦必限制其用於釀造酒的米·　之消費，以移充民食正常消費，同時限令人民節筵節酒。</p>
<p>二　·餅　等　民間習俗逢舊時節。年例每制餅，或　，或糕，若輔爲正食。未始不可，然事實上有錢製此等食物者每充爲正食外之多餘食物，一若吃糖喝茶·飲酒然，致有　者每因遇食而患滿腹之症，此亦可謂不需要或過量之食，其節約消費當亦有必要，爲勵行此點，當請統制組織　促代理配賣之糧食商店，嚴正按戶口購糧證配賣，與應得之配給量，不得超過之，如此雖仍用以　此等食物，然已得不充爲正用。</p>
<p>以上列三個施策，前二者於統制其來源及分配之社會多加說明，後一者則於糧食緊縮之際說明明節約之必要，管見以因励行此三策，則糧源當可暢裕，民食當可平均，糧食問題即不能全部解當可平怠多多，尚祈公論共參正之。</p>

<h3>文書專修學校　修業心得</h3>
<p>申報館社會服務處，爲適應社會需要，造就交書人材起見，特創辦文書專修學校，學雜費一概免收。余即報名，幸　取錄，列入甲班，五一開課，光陰茌苒，匆匆結束，茲將余三月來學習心得，列述如下：</p>
<p>①作文法：由馮時權夫子講述心得，有作文法六必要，其中配以黃校長　頑之校訓八標，　作者文如其人，人如其文，用心良苦。</p>
<p>②名人小簡：尺　爲人性最率真之流露，且所選小簡，多係訓誡之類，讀之可爲修養一助。教授孫德餘先生，精小學，　於習俗所見別字俗字，指正尤多。</p>
<p>③檔案處理法：此課就處理方法，作概括論述，頗爲評書，但余意茍能赴各大公司機關，　臨參觀實習，使學者從理論得到經驗，造詣必更精深。</p>
<p>④公文程式：公文種類甚繁，又爲專校最重要之課目，故每週有三小時之多，所授無專書，胥由　教師憑一己學識經驗，撮要傳授，故雖爲　甚暫，率能觸類旁通。</p>
<p>⑤服務道德：此課由易學大師楊中一先生擔任，原定爲踐形倫理學，中途改述易理，餉深致遠，多所發明，聆之獲益匪淺</p>
<p>⑥書法：書家朱銘新氏擔任，詳述文字源流，歷代書法　　，如何執筆，如何臨池，窮木探源，誨人不倦，進步甚速。</p>
<p>⑦日文：此課所教，均爲普通會話，余對日語，早有所學，故此課雖感太淺，但溫故知新，得益亦多。</p>
<p>⑧簿記及速記：原先只有薄記課，就普通會計學術，作概括講述。後改速記，由馬守剑氐親授已所發明之速記術，現者說法，事半功倍。　且旁證博引，故使學者易於領悟總之，雖在短短三月，然於文書門徑，大致具備。至於如何字斟句酌，條理清晰，如何爬　剔抉，去葉存　，是在諸同學平日，虛心向學，不斷　求，麻　學堂入　，窺見宮牆之美，而文書專修班，懂爲終南之捷徑云爾。（張仲韋）</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>（七）淚與血</p>
<p>「一言以蔽之，帝國潛水般的歷史，實在是血與淚的結晶。而且尚未作過一次戰。尚一次也未得到過血與淚的報酬。」</p>
<p>上校以沉拥痛　音這樣說，但突然改變語詞：</p>
<p>「方才　給你的不能搶救的沉沒潛水艇。我曾武斷地說艇員的熊度是　靜的，表面上看似乎矛盾，但事實決不如此。我有相當理由可以證明我的話是對的。總之，潛水艇服務員是有潛水艇服務雖精神的。無論過去，也無論现在，帝國潛水艇的服務雖都有這精神的。那求，這種精神是什麽？什麽時候，和什麼地方，生的呢？是必須回憶三十二年前四月十五日，不久以前，新　海面發生的最初遇難事件。第一次遇難時，帝國潛水艇服務員精神——潛水艇員必有的精神，就是建立　固基礎的。」</p>
<p>不待　，這是佐久間艇長的故事。是六號服務員的故事。</p>
<p>當時的帝國潛水艇，尚是草創時期，與其說是艇，倒莫如說是小船，常常發生毛病，旦船程很短，總是不敢遠離母艦的，這因爲是剛剛會走路的孩提。出動時，因爲沒有廚房，艇員只好帶飯去。數日也不過是由一號到九，共九　．現在則用不着葉形物包圍外　，而　擴養　於海面上，至於水上航定，則用汽油機關。</p>
<p>其中以六號艇最小，噸數僅五十七噸，並沒有艦橋這種東西，航行時艇長的地方，僅離水面二尺，就是內　艇在傍通過時，波浪也會打到身上來，而弄濕身體，所以演習和巡船時，則不許六號艇參加。</p>
<p>佐久　上尉受命爲六號艇長時，是明治四十二年十二月，但以前曾歷任一號艇至四號艇的艇長職，對於潛水艇具有專門知識，同時曾參加過日俄戰爭，而服務於巡洋艦和水雷艇上，在旅順和日本海曾大顯身手，建立了軍人的奇功偉　。家鄉是福井縣，父親是神官，據說他是很富於義務感和毅力強的人。</p>
<p>上尉在六號艇上服務時，就曾下過決心，願使這個最不完全的潛水艇，發揮最大的效率。當時的潛水艇，曾進行過一切的努力，而研究課題，曾非常多。但課題只有由服務員的犧牲精神來解決。（一二六）</p>

        <h1>1944.07.30</h1>
<h3>"The Spirit of Self-Reproach"</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiyuan</p>
<p>I remember on April 26th, the 29th year of the Republic [1940], Chairman Wang [Jingwei] once presented an article entitled "The Spirit of Self-Reproach," explaining that the spirit of self-reproach is different from arrogance, and even more different from servility. He further stated that the spirit of self-reproach must first have deep reflection, and second, a profound sense of responsibility. At that time, the National Government had not been back in the capital for long, and Chairman Wang's attitude towards national affairs was so frank and sincere, worthy of the style of the political world, which greatly moved the people.</p>
<p>Now, the National Government has been back in the capital for four years. When we examine the "Spirit of Self-Reproach" put forward by Chairman Wang, how much have we actually achieved in these four years? To what extent have we implemented it? Or are there any violations? These are the most important issues at hand.</p>
<p>First of all, it must be explained that the spirit of self-reproach is neither like arrogance nor servility. Of course, it will not be as reckless as the anti-Japanese faction, nor will it be as obsequious as the pro-foreign faction. Holding this attitude, over the past four years, we have gained the sympathy of allied nations externally and the support of the people internally. Therefore, the cancellation of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the conclusion of the alliance treaty, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, enemy property, and military-managed factories, can all be said to be the only gains from this spirit of self-reproach, which is neither arrogant nor servile.</p>
<p>Secondly, according to the spirit of self-reproach, what we should deeply reflect on is: when the National Government returned to the capital, it advocated two major national policies: implementing constitutional government internally and achieving peace externally. Over the past four years, not only has the peace policy failed to be implemented, but also the implementation of constitutional government is still a distant prospect. Is this due to personnel inertia or mistakes? Or is it due to insufficient strength? This is something that should be deeply reflected upon by everyone, from the government authorities to the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the spirit of self-reproach, what we should examine is: in these four years, have we done our best for national affairs? For example, when we returned to the capital, the price of rice in Shanghai was only 40 yuan per picul in old legal tender, and the tuition fees for primary and secondary schools were only twenty or thirty yuan per semester. However, four years later, the price of rice is as high as 13,000 yuan per picul, and the tuition fees for primary and secondary schools have increased to several thousand yuan. What is the reason for this? Why can't the government stabilize prices? Furthermore, why are there many things in politics that often only have plans but cannot be implemented? Furthermore, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive juncture, and even the Tojo cabinet of the allied nation Japan is being questioned everywhere. What is the reason for this? Shouldn't we have a profound sense of responsibility for the current political and economic ills!</p>
<p>The Analects say: "When the state is well governed, speak and act boldly; when the state is ill governed, act boldly and speak cautiously." We do not want to harm our actions and words to cater to the world and seek favor, but would rather speak and act boldly and offend others, saying what people do not want to hear, and hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, should recognize that the current stage is a decisive battle. Everyone should re-examine Mr. Wang's "Spirit of Self-Reproach" and not abandon the responsibilities that every country should bear.</p>
<h3>Thai Propaganda Bureau Announces Cabinet's Resignation</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Thai Propaganda Bureau announced at 10:00 AM on the 29th: The Pipat cabinet has collectively resigned.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Thai Pipat cabinet previously promulgated an emergency decree to change Phetchabun province into a special administrative region and to build a Buddhist capital near Saraburi. On the 20th and 22nd, it requested the National Assembly to approve the two decrees after they were presented, but the request was rejected by the Assembly. Therefore, based on the essence of Thai constitutional government, the Pipat cabinet decided to resign collectively and submitted the resignations of all cabinet members to the Regency Government on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Continue on Pagan and Tinian Islands; Enemy Casualties in Northern Burma Reach 50,000</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese garrison on Tinian Island intercepted enemy troops attempting to land along the coast on the morning of the 24th and repelled them. In the afternoon, they further attacked enemy troops (about one division) landing with tanks and engaged them in fierce battles. Later, the battle line gradually shifted southward. As of the morning of the 26th, Japanese troops defending the Carolinas Plantation and the eastern telegraph office area were in a stalemate with enemy troops. It is estimated that when the first landing enemy troops were repelled on the 24th, the enemy suffered more than 1,700 casualties. In the afternoon of the 24th, the enemy suffered more than 300 casualties. In the fierce battle at dawn on the 26th, the enemy suffered more than 200 casualties. To date, the enemy has suffered more than 4,200 casualties.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The battle situation this week is as follows:</p>
<p>In the North Pacific, the US Air Force is still active. On the night of the 23rd and during the day of the 24th, they attacked the Northern Kuril Islands. Japanese air units cooperated with ground units to intercept enemy aircraft, shooting down or destroying two enemy aircraft on the 23rd and shooting down two and destroying one on the 24th.</p>
<p>In China (ground operations), Japanese forces in the eastern section of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province annihilated the Chongqing army in Anren (10 kilometers southeast of Hengyang) and completely occupied the area. Furthermore, advancing from Liling, Chaling, and Anren, Japanese forces are currently engaged in separate battles with them. In addition, Japanese forces continue to fiercely attack Hengyang City. In the Jinlansi and Baihepao areas in the northwestern section of the Yuehan Railway, they attacked the Chongqing army coming to their defense. Chongqing's 62nd Army's 651st Division and 157th Division attacked near Yumu Mountain, 10 and 17 kilometers southwest of Hengyang. Japanese forces have annihilated and struck these divisions. In South China, the battle situation is also progressing smoothly. (Air warfare) The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, in addition to cooperating with ground operations in Central and Southern China and operations against the Chongqing army in Hengyang, is also responsible for guarding the airspace above the battlefield. In the air battle over Hengyang on the 21st, Japanese forces shot down or destroyed four Chongqing aircraft. Over Changsha, they destroyed one. On the 23rd, in the airspace over the battlefield in Central China, they shot down or destroyed five Chongqing aircraft. On the 25th, they shot down or destroyed seven Chongqing aircraft over Yuezhou and Changde. On the other hand, in the operation to attack the Chongqing army's base, they also achieved remarkable results. On the 24th, attacking Lingling, they destroyed 18 Chongqing aircraft. All Japanese aircraft flew away quickly. In mid-July, Chongqing aircraft attacked 155 times, totaling more than 1,000 aircraft. The Japanese Air Force alone shot down or destroyed 190 of them, while the Japanese side only lost 11 aircraft.</p>
<p>In Burma (ground operations), the enemy seems to be deploying the 4th and 33rd Armies to rescue Imphal, gradually increasing its forces in front of the Japanese army. The Japanese army is fighting bravely, shortening the battle line in some areas, and is still engaged in fierce battles. In Northern Burma, Myitkyina is still in Japanese hands. The enemy's newly formed 38th Division, 22nd Division, and West African Brigade are advancing southward from Hukawng towards Mogaung. The Japanese army is securing key points west of Tepo (18 kilometers southwest of Mogaung) and continuing to fight fiercely day after day. The Japanese army in that area has overcome the difficulties of terrain and climate and has inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Since the start of operations in that area, the enemy's losses have totaled 50,000 casualties. There has been no major change in the battle situation on the Salween River front. The Japanese army is firmly holding its positions and taking the opportunity to break the enemy's counterattacks.</p>
<p>In the Central Pacific, after the fall of Saipan Island, enemy troops landed on Pagan Island and Tinian Island on the morning of the 21st and the 23rd, respectively. Japanese and US forces are currently engaged in fierce battles. In addition, enemy aircraft have also actively bombed Japanese strongholds in the South Pacific. On Saipan Island, the enemy is currently using Aslito Airfield. On Pagan Island, the enemy's naval forces approached the coast of the island with dozens of transport ships on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th, more than 200 carrier-based aircraft attacked. On the 19th, the enemy fleet invaded Akashi Bay and Showa Bay on the west coast of the island and shelled them day and night. On the 20th, more than 200 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked, and warships close to the coast shelled again. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy landed more than two divisions of troops in the Akashi Bay and Showa Bay areas under the cover of artillery fire. Japanese troops gathered in the area south of Akashi City and launched a fierce attack on the enemy landing in that area, and are still fighting bravely. According to US Secretary of War Stimson, as of the 25th after the landing, the enemy's losses had reached 3,311. On the Tinian Island front, enemy aircraft have been frequently attacking the port since the 20th. On the 22nd, they scouted outside Tinian Port. On the 23rd, the enemy fleet (including about ten battleships, cruisers, and destroyers) also appeared near the island and shelled it. Enemy soldiers then attempted to land in Tinian Port and the northwestern part of the island under the cover of the shelling. However, the Japanese army in that area set one enemy battleship and two destroyers on fire and sank one. They also repelled the enemy. In the northwestern area, the Japanese army repelled the invading enemy twice, but the enemy then reinforced and launched a third attack, so they finally landed on the island. The Japanese army is now securing the area south of the center of the island and is engaged in fierce battles with about one division of the enemy invading from the north. In addition, enemy aircraft are intensifying their attacks on the Western Caroline Islands and Rota Island. For example, on the 23rd, 25th, and 27th, enemy forces continued to bomb in small formations. On the 21st, 20 enemy aircraft, and on the 22nd, 22 aircraft, continuously attacked Yap, resulting in two being shot down and more than five being destroyed. On the 24th, 21 aircraft attacked Nauru, 130 attacked Wotje, and 25 attacked Melejon. On the 25th, about 100 aircraft attacked the Palau Islands (shooting down seven), and on the 26th, about 700 aircraft attacked the island again, shooting down and destroying 17. On the 24th and 26th, 60 large aircraft attacked Truk, and on the 25th, seven bombed Pohnpei (shooting down one) and 72 bombed Palau (shooting down five, destroying two). The activity of enemy aircraft in that area is echoing the developments on Tinian Island and Pagan Island, so it is worth noting.</p>
<p>In the South Pacific, enemy aircraft continue to attack Rabaul and Kavieng, and enemy aircraft often appear in the southwestern region of New Guinea. Between the 21st and 26th, more than 100 enemy aircraft bombed Manokwari in New Guinea, and other places were also subjected to air raids from time to time. Enemy torpedo boats also appeared frequently. In the Banda Sea area, two enemy aircraft appeared over Saumlaki on the 26th. On the 25th, enemy large aircraft attacked Namlea on Buru Island, west of Sula Island. In North Australia, enemy aircraft attacked a total of 169 times in mid-July, and enemy aircraft in that area also carried out daytime bombings on several occasions.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean, on the morning of the 25th, more than 20 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked Sabang on Sumatra Island and bombed Koetaradja with 23 aircraft. At the same time, several enemy cruisers and destroyers approached the waters outside Sabang and began shelling the area. After the Japanese army counterattacked, they shot down most of the attacking enemy aircraft, sunk two enemy destroyers and one submarine, and damaged one destroyer. Japanese losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Hengyang Tightening Encirclement; All Key Facilities Occupied</h3>
<p>A Certain Base on the Hunan Front, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese forces encircling Hengyang are currently tightening the encirclement. All key facilities of the Chongqing army on the outer perimeter of Hengyang have been occupied by Japanese forces. In addition to the Hengyang airfield, an important air base of the Chongqing army on the Xiang River, which has been secured by Japanese forces, the Ministry of Military Administration, the food depot, the West Railway Station, the Hengyang Power Plant of the Xianggui Railway, and the steel and machinery factory and automobile factory south of the city have also been occupied by the Japanese forces advancing southward since the 7th. Therefore, the Chongqing army's continuous supply to Hengyang has been completely cut off.</p>
<p>A Certain Base on the Hunan Front, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - A large-scale double encirclement operation in the Hengyang area has now begun. The Japanese army's strategy for capturing Hengyang is focused on annihilating the Chongqing field army. The Chongqing army is still trying to gather its remaining forces to reverse the decline in Hengyang, and has dispatched the 98th Division, 194th Division, and 157th Division to penetrate the Japanese encirclement from the south and west, but they have been annihilated separately. Therefore, fierce battles have broken out around Hengyang. A unit of the Japanese forces advancing southward defeated the Chongqing 194th Division, which was gathered at Maoliping (18 li west of Hengyang), on the 27th. However, the Chongqing army sneaked back into Baimatang. By the evening of the 24th, the Chongqing army had built a position on the banks of the Zhushui River north of Hengyang, but it was detected by the Japanese army, who immediately attacked it, and the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses and fled. The Japanese army pursuing the Chongqing 194th Division broke through the central part of the Chongqing army and reached Xinqiao (15-16 li west of Hengyang) on the morning of the 21st, and encountered a unit of the Chongqing 62nd Army, which they are now attacking. Another unit of the Japanese army defeated the main force of the Chongqing 65th Army, which was advancing from Wutang (13 kilometers west of Hengyang), on the 19th. The Japanese army arrived at Zhongqiao (10 kilometers west of Hengyang) on the evening of the 21st and repelled the Chongqing 150th and 157th Divisions, which had attempted to attack the rear of the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army preempted the attack and made a large detour to Tiesitang (8 kilometers southwest of Hengyang) and launched a fierce attack on them. Furthermore, a regiment of the Chongqing 65th Army, which had come to recapture the airfield, gathered at Hejiaqiao (4 kilometers south of Hengyang) on the 23rd, but was completely annihilated in a surprise attack by the Japanese army. On the other hand, about 500 Chongqing troops who came to seize the airfield were ambushed by the Japanese army at Hejiayuan and were also completely annihilated. From the above, it can be seen that the Chongqing troops coming to the aid of Hengyang are only serving as targets for the Japanese army's attacks. The losses of Xue Yue's army are indeed increasing, and the collapse of the Chongqing 9th War Area is indeed imminent.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Launch Final Assault</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing on the 28th, the battle situation in Hengyang is as follows: Chongqing military authorities announced to foreign reporters on the 28th that the Japanese army is launching its final assault on Chongqing's electricity, which has been defending Hengyang for 33 days. It is said that the Japanese army's tank unit has been transferred from Changsha to the area. According to recent news from Chongqing, the Japanese army will repair the highway from Changsha to Hengshan, and Japanese tanks have appeared north of Hengyang. The battle in the Hengyang area is currently unfolding on four sides: the southern, southwestern, northwestern, and eastern suburbs. The Japanese army is attacking with all its strength. The old city is now defending the area, and the situation is critical. Military supplies are being supplied by air. Its reinforcements are attempting to move along the Xianggui Railway towards Hengyang, trying to make contact with the defending troops in Hengyang from the southwest. The vanguard has contacted the Japanese army and started a fierce battle. The Chongqing army's reinforcements only reached a point one and a half kilometers from Hengyang, but then retreated after being subjected to a fierce attack by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is currently waiting for the tank unit and heavy artillery unit from the north to arrive, and will soon launch a major offensive.</p>
<h3>Chongqing and US Aircraft Attack Anshan and Dalian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Kwantung Army Press Department announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: At 11:30 AM today, several B-2 type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Anshan and Dalian. The results of the battle have now been determined. One enemy aircraft was shot down over Anshan, and Japanese damage was minor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Tenrikyo Followers Engage in Coal Production Increase</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The headquarters of the Japanese Tenrikyo Church, for the sake of increasing coal production, its head, Nakayama, and 90 staff members of the headquarters, departed from the church headquarters in Nara Prefecture for the Mitsui coalfields in Kyushu on the afternoon of the 30th, leading 10,000 followers of the church nationwide to form the Tenrikyo Coalfield Volunteer Corps and engage in increasing production.</p>
<h3>Closely Cooperating with Allied Nations to Advance Towards Motherland India; Commander Bose Pours Out Determination to Fight</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in Burma, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Commander Bose of the Indian National Army, speaking about the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan, said: "I know Marshal Sugiyama and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, but I have not met Prime Minister Koiso or other cabinet members. However, we Indians are very pleased that the new cabinet, composed of first-class figures in Japan, stands on the position of all Asian nations, with the ultimate victory as the goal, and advances courageously. We are grateful for the support we received from former Prime Minister Tojo, both publicly and privately." On the occasion of the first anniversary of Burma's independence on August 1, Bose issued the following statement on the 27th: "No matter how the enemy counterattacks, we will not be moved or alarmed. Victory or defeat is a common occurrence in war. No matter how difficult, it is enough to strengthen the determination of us Axis nations to strive for final victory. Many Indians in East Asia who have witnessed the situation on the India-Burma line have exhausted their family wealth to contribute to the National Children's Donation Fund. The number of volunteers is also gradually increasing. The intention to reduce the enemy's morale is now becoming increasingly high. Although the Indian National Army is small in number, this is not a problem. We can only advance towards the motherland and dye the flag of India's independence red with our own blood, and we believe that the follow-up troops will surely follow me." Up to now, the Japanese army has often taken the lead in advancing on the India-Burma front, but now our Indian National Army's battlefield training has been completed with the awareness of death. Now is the time for us to advance ahead of the Japanese army." Finally, Commander Bose concluded his speech by writing his beliefs as follows: "After continuous disastrous defeats, the enemy, the US and Britain, have recently seen some success in their counterattacks. They are now exaggerating these small successes with great fanfare, but we cannot underestimate this kind of counterattack. It is enough to make our iron will to fight to the end and win even stronger. This is not only true for the 100 million Japanese people, but also for the Asian nations who are resolutely fighting against the US and Britain, who all have this firm determination. The US and Britain are irreconcilable enemies of the Indian people, so under any circumstances, we will always closely cooperate with Japan and its allies and do our best. I would like to express our determination again here. India now has only one slogan: victory and destruction of the enemy."</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Reports on International Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The regular cabinet meeting on the 28th was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM, attended by Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members. First, Interior Minister Oyama explained in detail the special measures for encouraging the increase of rice production in overseas territories and the provision of rice, which was immediately approved. Then, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai spoke together, generally saying that in order to adapt to the situation of the decisive battle stage, they sincerely hoped that the army and navy would jointly and strongly promote the policies adopted by the government in the future. At 1:30 PM, there was a break, and the meeting resumed at 2:00 PM. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu reported on the recent international situation, and then decided on the personnel of the Vice-Ministers of the Ministry of Education, etc. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Java Central Council to Hold Meeting Next Month</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Fourth Central Council meeting of this question is scheduled to be held in mid-August. On the 25th, the Military Administration Department announced the matters for consultation with the council as follows: "Under the current intense war situation, the need for labor is extremely important. In order to ensure sufficient labor, the past concept of labor should be abandoned, and efforts should be made to improve labor capacity. It is requested that measures be taken in each area to ensure that residents fully engage in labor and participate in defense and production work. Regarding the popularization and rapid implementation of this plan, the council is requested to express its opinions."</p>
<h3>Indian Viceroy Wavell Refuses to Meet Gandhi</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Since his release from prison, Gandhi has advocated the settlement of the Hindu-Muslim reconciliation plan, and later proposed the organization of an Indian national government, and has requested to meet with Indian Viceroy Wavell. According to a New Delhi report, the Indian Governor-General replied to Gandhi that the Duke of Connaught has not occurred any new situation, so there is no reason to meet with you.</p>

<h3>Germany Adapts to Wartime Environment, Promotes Total Mobilization Plan, Awakening People to Fight for the Future of the Nation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports: Germany is implementing total mobilization to adapt to the wartime environment, and some preliminary measures have been prepared. For example, in cities, postal services will be reduced to twice a day, and in villages, they will be reduced to once a week. Goebbels and his subordinates are divided into a design committee and an executive committee. The progress of some work is very tense and smooth. The goal is to transfer domestic troops to the front line, then draw young men from various industries to form domestic guard forces, and then use the men and women workers in various industries related to warfare and supplies to supplement the labor shortage in the former industries. Those affected by the above changes number more than several million. The age limit for women's service has been extended from 45 to 55, and the age limit for expanding British women's service is still five years less. Doctors will be more stringent in issuing sick leave certificates in the future, and even cultural aspects will be subject to certain restrictions, but it is expected that the entertainment industry will not be completely canceled. In short, the authorities' measures are based on factual needs and will not impose unnecessary restrictions. The authorities will issue another statement calling on the people to cooperate voluntarily.</p>
<h3>Allies Hold "Monetary and Financial Conference"; Britain and America Harbor Conspiracy to Manipulate World Currency</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The anti-Axis powers, centered around Britain and America, held a so-called "Monetary and Financial Conference" in Bretton Woods, USA, from the 11th to the 24th of this month. Although the participants included countries such as Australia, South Africa, India, the Chongqing government, the French Committee of National Liberation, and the Polish government-in-exile, totaling 44 nations, the conference discussed post-war global economic issues as if the war had already ended and the world could be painted with peace. Neutral countries like Argentina, Turkey, Switzerland, and Portugal were not present, which underscores its lack of credibility in the world. It is even more obvious that Britain and America are attempting to use it as a tool to dominate the world. Since the summer and autumn of the year before last, the anti-Axis powers have been lavishly discussing post-war global reconstruction, especially the United States, where official and unofficial pronouncements on reconstruction ideas have been common. Their intention is nothing more than to create illusions and deceive people. What is even more laughable and pathetic is that a segment of pro-British and American elements within the Chongqing government have echoed these sentiments, becoming mere mouthpieces of Britain and America while still being self-satisfied. In this so-called "Monetary and Financial Conference," the Chongqing government has clearly become an appendage of Britain and America. As for the other small countries and governments-in-exile invited to participate, they were merely small soldiers helping to bolster the appearance of strength. Looking at the entire process of the conference, it further proves that Britain indeed has ambitions to dominate the world, especially America, which has used its wealth to achieve its long-cherished desire to surpass Britain. Setting aside whether the conference was merely theoretical or a mere illusion, a brief review of its proceedings reveals a glimpse of the anti-Axis powers' so-called "post-war global reconstruction" plan.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis powers' Monetary and Financial Conference lasted a full week, which is not a short period. However, the main proposals passed were the establishment of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Development Bank. Although the detailed content of the plans for these two banks is not yet clear, learning from historical lessons reveals that they are clearly</p>
<p>pet organizations</p>
<p>of Britain and America, used by them as registered institutions to invade world markets and exchange for the money of various countries. The so-called stabilization of international exchange rates and the establishment of a stabilization fund even more fully expose the vicious means of Britain and America. The total amount of this stabilization fund is projected to be 8.8 billion US dollars, of which the United States alone accounts for more than 30%, contributing 2.75 billion US dollars. Britain contributes 1.3 billion US dollars, accounting for slightly less than 15%. Therefore, the conspiracy of Britain and America to manipulate world currency is evident. It is rumored that various countries had serious disputes when contributing to this fund, which is not without reason. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Bretton Woods on the 23rd, participating countries hoped to receive a larger share, but the amount of the fund was extremely limited. Thus, the Indian representative immediately expressed</p>
<p>extreme dissatisfaction</p>
<p>with the inequitable distribution of the International Monetary Fund's stabilization fund allocation. India was allocated only 400 million US dollars in this 8.8 billion US dollar fund, so their dissatisfaction is natural. Considering the Chongqing government's situation at this conference, it further shows that the Chongqing government is willing to be an appendage of Britain and America. Taking the allocated fund as an example, the Chongqing government's allocation is 550 million US dollars, accounting for slightly more than 6% of the total. Compared to the near-monopoly of 50% by Britain and America, the difference is like heaven and earth. (One sentence). Furthermore, regarding the so-called International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, its nature is no different from the East India Company that once invaded India. The Chongqing government's representative to the conference, Kong Xiangxi, openly stated that he (Kong referring to himself) firmly believed that the strengthening of China's economy was a necessary condition for maintaining peace and improving global welfare, which had long been a dream.</p>
<p>Chinese Market</p>
<p>He believes that when the purchasing power of 400 million customers increases after the war, it will surely become a reality. Only someone as shameless as Kong Xiangxi could utter such shameless remarks. Leaving aside whether the strengthening of China's economy can truly be a necessary condition for maintaining peace and improving global welfare, even based on Kong's own words, it is clear that on the one hand, he wants to develop China for his own benefit, and on the other hand, he wants to openly sell out the Chinese market, willingly allowing China to be permanently relegated to a</p>
<p>semi-colonial</p>
<p>economy from which it cannot extricate itself. Therefore, Kong's statement is not only a personal display of shamelessness but also sufficient to show the insane nature of the pro-British and American elements in the Chongqing government. When Kong met with a Central News Agency reporter before the opening of the conference, he even said that for the sake of various allied countries, the Chongqing government had engaged in "concessions" and "sacrifices" at this conference. Kong's generosity at the expense of the country is truly heartbreaking. Spokespersons for the American delegation, as well as other participating countries, openly acknowledged this, saying that the Chongqing government had a special friendship with the American government and people. Kong's betrayal of the country and his obsequious flattery of the United States have been completely exposed. Under these circumstances, to still expect the Chongqing government to enable China to be independent and self-reliant is to indulge in wishful thinking. Although the above is merely a comedy performed by the boastful Britain and America, it cannot diminish our beliefs in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Selection of Experimental County Magistrates - Decision to Consider Carefully</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Outline of the Rural Construction Plan and handed it to the National Economic Commission for reference, and established the Rural Construction Promotion and Implementation Committee to oversee rural construction, all sectors of the country have unanimously expressed their joy. It is generally believed that China's social economy is still based on the rural economy, so increasing production to stabilize people's livelihoods requires the promotion of rural construction. The designation of five counties as experimental counties is a timely measure during this difficult period. The reporter also interviewed specialists on this matter. According to them, the rural construction policies decided by the government this time are very timely, and the selection of five counties for experimentation is appropriate. However, what should be considered is the promotion of these five experimental counties. The five counties designated this time, Jiangning, Kunshan, Dangtu, Jiaxing, and Nankang, are all relatively well-governed counties, which is conducive to the smooth start of rural construction. However, it is undeniable that since the war, all sectors have suffered from the exploitation of corrupt officials and gentry, and the suffering of the countryside is profound. Rural construction has been unable to progress due to this. It is hoped that the central authorities will carefully consider the selection of county magistrates for the experimental counties and appoint virtuous and capable individuals with experience. What the people hope for is that the central authorities will carefully select the county magistrates, ensuring that they can adhere to the central government's policies, benefit the local area, and not give opportunities to uneducated and greedy officials. Furthermore, the success or failure of this experimental county administration is not only a measure of the success or failure of rural construction but also a key to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Burmese Government Establishes Army Defense Council; Mr. Aung San Appointed Chairman of the Council</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Burmese government recently established the Army Defense Council, chaired by Defense Minister Mr. Aung San, with ten members. Six members are from the military, including Army Commander Mr. Hsi Meng, and twelve members are from the government, including Minister of Supplies Mr. Dakin Than. The council is responsible for implementing the five-year military buildup plan and addressing issues related to strengthening military forces.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The first anniversary of Burma's declaration of independence in August is approaching.</p>
<p>One Year of Birth</p>
<p>The new Burma has made considerable progress in all aspects and continues to move forward based on the mission of defending East Asia and building East Asia. At the Greater East Asia Conference held last year, Burmese national representative Ba Maw said that Burma, located on the front line, had experienced all the sufferings of modern warfare, but no matter how difficult Burma was, the determination to defend the whole of East Asia was very firm. They aided the Japanese army and the Indian National Army fighting in India, fighting everywhere, and regarding war as life. Burma knew that without completing the Greater East Asia War, there would never be a day to achieve independence. Now the whole of Burma is working hard on measures to achieve this. Therefore, Ba Maw's character determined his spirit and action, becoming Burma's</p>
<p>sole party</p>
<p>which is the Dobama Sinyetha Association. This frontline movement has provided the whole Burmese people with a path to follow and is a major spiritual movement for the Burmese people. For example, a Burmese female student at a certain Japanese language school in Pegu, upon hearing the news of her teacher's death in the Battle of Bukit, angrily wrote in her Japanese composition: "If we were born as men, we would go to the battlefield and assassinate these despicable Englishmen." This is the best example of the Burmese people's anti-British sentiment. The thorough dissemination of this frontline spirit was created by the Dobama Sinyetha Association, which works closely with the government to encourage the Burmese people's spirit of hard work and has achieved tangible results. In addition, they have made special efforts to promote government policies such as agricultural land policies and rice policies, forming</p>
<p>labor service</p>
<p>teams or grassroots recruitment orders, establishing a labor mobilization system that has achieved great results. General movements of the Dobama Sinyetha Association, such as the activities of the East Asia Youth League Burmese branch and the women's division, also shoulder the important task of this movement. Youth in the transition period have always occupied a very important position, so many of those in important positions under Defense Minister Aung San are young people. These young people are full of patriotism, and the Youth League, which hopes to guide these young people, bears a heavy responsibility. The activities of the Youth League should also adapt to these important tasks. Currently, the Burmese youth organization, under the guidance of Chairman Ma Bojiang, has 30,000 members and 264 branches across the country, standing on the front line in Burma, undertaking practical tasks such as monitoring enemy aircraft, rescue, and counter-espionage, and also carrying out ideological activities everywhere. The women's division of the League and the</p>
<p>Burmese Women's</p>
<p>League are also carrying out frontline activities from all aspects of life, and the scope of their activities is growing daily. Burma is about to advance vigorously towards great undertakings under the banner of one-line movement, centered on national representative Ba Maw.</p>
<h3>Bonomi Regime Consults with Soviet Representatives</h3>
<p>Milan, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: Rome officially announced that the Prime Minister of the Italian puppet government, Bonomi, had consulted with Soviet representatives in Rome regarding the current situation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Increase Pressure; War Approaches Warsaw; Fierce Battle in the Vistula River Pocket</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: Yesterday, Soviet forces attempted to cross the central Vistula River but were repulsed and suffered heavy losses. There were fierce battles in the southeast of Warsaw and the Siedlce area. German forces have withdrawn from Szarża. Soviet attacks between the lower Bug River and Łomża have not succeeded.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The severity of the Eastern Front situation has changed significantly in recent days due to the rapid advances of the Soviet army and the German army's large-scale retreat. With the abandonment of Daugavpils, Białystok, and the railroads connecting Leningrad and Warsaw, their function has been lost. The railroad from Leningrad along the Baltic coast through the three Baltic states to East Prussia is threatened in Šiauliai and Kaunas in Lithuania. On the other hand, in the central theater of operations on the Vistula Front, the Soviet pressure on Warsaw is gradually increasing. With the German abandonment of Brest-Litovsk, the heavy pressure on Warsaw's front is rapidly increasing. According to front-line news, German forces have added strong tank units east of the Vistula River to intercept large numbers of Soviet troops, not retreating a step and continuing to resist bravely. According to the Associated Press, a part of the Soviet army has advanced to a location 48 kilometers southeast of Warsaw, but the Soviet army's attempt to cross the Vistula River again has not succeeded. Soviet troops arriving on the east bank near Dęblin are advancing north along the Vistula River toward Warsaw. The Soviet army under Marshal Konev is attempting to advance west and south from the Lviv area. The westward forces crossed the San River for about 30 kilometers between Jarosław and Przemyśl, heading east towards Krakow. The southward forces advanced from Zbarazh to Stanislav, about 100 kilometers southwest of Lviv, pressing towards the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Northern Soviet Army Invades Šiauliai</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Swedish News Agency reports: According to a statement by the Swedish military authorities, the enemy is increasing pressure in the Łomża-Riga area. Although the Soviet army is resisting, the enemy has invaded the city of Šiauliai. The enemy had invaded Mitau, but the Soviet army drove them out in a counterattack.</p>
<p>Kaunas, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: British and Soviet broadcasts reported that Kaunas had been surprisingly occupied by Soviet troops, which is absolutely untrue. In fact, Soviet troops are still within the battle lines tens of kilometers from Kaunas. Soldiers in the city live as usual, and the main transportation routes in the city are still directed by the police. At that time, the sound of artillery came from the east, which was the artillery fire along the road from Kaunas to Vilnius. Other than that, Kaunas is unusually calm. The number of Soviet troops is large, and the firepower is strong, but the German army is responding effectively. It will not be possible for the enemy to occupy this city in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Turkish Pact Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: After the start of negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey in this area, they are continuing in Moscow and have progressed to the stage where an agreement can be drafted. The basis of the negotiations and the nature of the agreement are still unknown, but the issue of the Dardanelles Strait is clearly in a crucial position. These negotiations will affect Turkey's relations with Britain and America and will also affect Soviet-Turkish and Soviet-Bulgarian relations. Enemy rumors that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations are a harbinger of the breakdown of the German-Turkish alliance must be decided by the Turkish National Assembly or a meeting.</p>
<p>Turkish Cabinet Rumored to Be Reorganized</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the governments of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have made various demands on Turkey and used diplomatic policies to coerce the Turkish government, opinions within the Turkish government have been quite divided. In recent days, rumors of a reorganization of the current cabinet of Prime Minister Saraçoğlu have also been frequent. According to a dispatch from Ankara, it is said that a partial reorganization may be possible, but a full reorganization is impossible. In short, there is no intention to replace the foreign minister.</p>
<p>Berlin Expresses Deep Concern</p>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: The German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, has returned to Ankara to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu. Negotiations will likely take place today, mainly discussing the current political situation. The possible issue of a Turkish-Soviet agreement may also be raised.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Launches Large-Scale Attack on Germany; Eighty-One Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports: According to disclosures from the German Air Force, the British lost 81 aircraft within two hours on Friday. When British aircraft carried out a terror bombing of Stuttgart on Friday night, German night fighters alone shot down 60 four-engine heavy bombers. The other enemy aircraft were shot down over the North Sea when a small squadron of British aircraft attacked the Hamburg area. The British thus lost 500 air force personnel at the same time. The number shot down by anti-aircraft guns is not yet known, so the number shot down may increase.</p>
<p>Another report: On Saturday, a large formation of enemy aircraft flew from the west to central Germany. Before the enemy aircraft reached their target area, German air defense units intercepted them and launched a fierce air battle. The number of enemy aircraft shot down has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Makes Demands on Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: Unconfirmed reports state that the Soviet Union has again demanded that Bulgaria establish four Soviet consulates in Bulgaria. If a satisfactory reply is not received, diplomatic relations will be severed.</p>
<p>Budapest, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Sofia, Bulgarian Interior Minister Kytanchev declared on the 27th that the Bulgarian government had completely released all political prisoners.</p>
<h3>Argentine Public Demonstrations Support National Policy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: After Argentine Foreign Minister Bèrullot delivered a speech on national foreign policy, Argentine President Farrell also issued a statement, saying that the recent demonstrations by the Argentine public show their complete support for the government's domestic and foreign policies. The orderly nature of the demonstrations is particularly gratifying.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Citizens Ordered to Cut Hair</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Last autumn, the Silingol League of Inner Mongolia formed the Mongolian Youth Patriotic Team from young people aged 18 to 30, striving to improve their lives, cultivate each other, and encourage diligence and public service. On the 25th of this month, League Leader Lun ordered all citizens to cut their hair. This time, all men under the age of 50 must cut their hair. Government officials have immediately cut their hair after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Normandy Battle Increasingly Significant; German Defenses West of Saint-Lô Breached</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The offensive launched by the US First Army west and south of Saint-Lô has broken through German defenses. A communiqué issued by the German Führer's headquarters also acknowledged that the battle has become increasingly significant. The anti-Axis camp is also heavily publicizing the renewed offensive. According to the Associated Press from London, US tank units broke through German defenses on a 25-mile front west of Saint-Lô and have been taking encirclement positions in Coutances in three routes since the 28th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German Military Command issued a statement on the 28th: German forces in northern France have withdrawn from Caën-Villers-Bocage to new rear positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports: A German official war report stated that the large-scale offensive launched by the enemy in the western Normandy landing sector has expanded its scope on Friday. East of Saint-Lô, local enemy offensives were repulsed, except for a small gap. German forces also counterattacked south of the towns of Mesnil and Villers-Bocage, defeating the attacking enemy forces. The enemy on the west side, having received reinforcements, managed to advance southwest after fierce fighting. German forces on the western flank of the enemy landing sector disengaged from the pursuing enemy on both sides of Coutances. After retreating to new positions, the German army repelled all enemy offensives.</p>
<p>Invasion Front, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: US troops breaking into the western sector of the hedgerow front have now been halted at Créances. On the Savigny front, the southwesternmost point reached by US troops advancing from Saint-Lô is Savigny, located six kilometers west of Coutances. US troops advancing on La Haye-du-Puits have been checked by German forces. The US troops have only managed to expand the width of the hedgerow line to 12 kilometers and the depth to 12 to 15 kilometers. After carrying out a planned withdrawal between Caën and Villers-Bocage, German forces have now recovered the gap. The anti-Axis forces have achieved their goals in the west and north. In the direction of Caën, US forces are attacking Avranches to the south and the city of Vire to the southwest, after first bombarding them with artillery and aircraft.</p>
<p>Ships Sunk in Seine Bay</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German Führer's headquarters announced: On the 25th and 26th, German naval units sank an enemy 4,000-ton oil tanker, destroyed four cargo ships totaling 25,000 tons, and damaged a troop transport ship in Seine Bay. In addition, German coastal batteries in the eastern Seine Bay bombarded an anti-Axis battleship.</p>
<p>Cherbourg Harbor Unable to Be Used</p>
<p>Berlin News Agency Dispatch - Havas reports: Anti-Axis forces have still not been able to use the port of Cherbourg. Only small ships smaller than destroyers can enter the port, and there is still a great risk. Recently, a Frenchman from Cherbourg told reporters that the port is still mined. Many French men and women are being ordered to clear the devastation, even children are participating in the work, so accidents occur frequently and many people die. Houses often collapse and crush many people. The Americans are merely overseeing the work.</p>
<h3>Battle for Pisa, Northern Italy Begins</h3>
<p>Milan, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: The battle for Pisa has begun. US and German artillery batteries exchanged fire across the Arno River last night.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Swedish News Agency reports: On Thursday, there was no other important battle news on the Italian front except for the battles south and southeast of Florence. The aim of the British new offensive is to break through the German defenses around Florence, but the result was again defeated by German reinforcements.</p>
<h3>The Dawn of Indian Liberation Uehara Torashige - The Collapsing British Rule</h3>
<p>Longevity, with many shames, or much humiliation, naturally varies from person to person, but what people share is the point of longevity and many sights. The Indian National Army, formed with the help of the Japanese army, advancing like a broken bamboo from Burma abroad towards India, has anyone considered this as a real problem? Everyone knows that the British and Americans are arbitrarily dominating the Far East, and this has a long history. "Resolving to liberate the compatriots and close relatives of East Asia and eradicate the shackles of the British and Americans" has long been in the hearts of the Japanese people. Among our Japanese predecessors, there have been many who have elaborated on this point. It is somewhat presumptuous for someone like me to join the discussion, but I once answered the overseas student test question "On the Alliance of Japan, China, and India" from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun.</p>
<p>However, is this a real problem or a practical problem? No. It is an ideal, a fantasy, a "delirium." Looking at the overall situation of the world, looking at the masses of East Asia, there is no other way except this. If the Anglo-Saxon race and the Jewish people behind them who control the money are truly wise, then this "delirium" of the Japanese people might never be realized. However, they, who are greedy and despise the world—despite the repeated warnings of enlightened people such as Lord Noel-Buxton and Bertrand Russell—launched the First World War. As a result, the balance of world power was disrupted. Naturally, East Asia, including Japan, was greatly affected by the disruption of the balance. Therefore, the historical footprint from the last war to this war cannot be ignored. In short, this war is the inevitable outcome of the last war, and in this respect, there is an unparalleled connection. That is, from "disruption of the balance" to the unfolding of a "new world order."</p>
<p>Thus, "delirium" becomes reality. The positive significance of the Greater East Asia War lies in this. At the same time, the Japanese have done something that has never been done before, and this joy is indescribable. If one lives long, one sees much. Although I am still young, the things I have encountered cannot but surprise and praise me. I cannot but say that I am fortunate to have managed to live until today.</p>
<p>Readers may think it is ridiculous for me to call myself lucky so presumptuously. But there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>The current joy can be said to be a reflection of the previous pain. What kind of pain was it in the past?</p>
<p>The Sorrow of India</p>
<p>After the end of my year-long internship, in the summer of 1918, I suppressed my boundless hope and went to Bombay. Since ancient times, it has been said, "Go west to worship Buddha, go south to obtain scriptures." Now I came to observe and study the flesh-and-blood national rights movement of the Indian people. However, I was greatly disappointed. My stay in India lasted from the summer of 1918 to the spring of 1920. That was a tense period. In Europe, peace conferences were held due to the armistice. In India, new criminal laws were implemented through self-government, Gandhi was arrested and eventually released, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of the masses, the implementation of self-government (?), and other major events occurred one after another. At the same time, the assassination of Afghan King Habibullah Khan eventually led to the Anglo-Indian war against Afghanistan, and I, a young journalist, was able to have a stimulating life. However, my first purpose in studying the Indian national rights movement itself only disappointed me greatly.</p>
<p>Where is India going? It is impossible to get through anywhere. That was the conclusion I reached. Gandhi is a Mahatma, and there is no doubt about that. Even to this day, I still sincerely admire him and read his great works with utmost respect. Why read his books? Because his books are not closed-door creations, but very practical, using mathematics as a mirror, all based on practical theories like the four arithmetic operations. The fact that such a proposition cannot be implemented is naturally not Gandhi's fault. But the fact is that it has not been implemented, so what is going on?</p>
<p>Bai Letian asked: "What is the great meaning of Buddhism?"</p>
<p>Zen Master Wuke replied: "Do no evil, do all good."</p>
<p>"Everyone knows this."</p>
<p>"A three-year-old child knows it, but even an eighty-year-old man finds it difficult to do."</p>
<p>Therefore, the principle can be made clear. Gandhi's advocacy of "grasping the truth" has the same meaning as "do no evil, do all good," which is something that ordinary people cannot fully do. This is a tragedy. Most Indians aim too high and cannot put things into practice, which the British cannot understand. The British only believe in force, and any other truth is irrelevant to them. Therefore, the Indian people themselves believe that their current situation is due to their own lack of virtue or the retribution of sins in a previous life. If they practice abstinence and bathing and march in a procession, the British will view it as a "threat." If rumors spread that "India is not peaceful," the British will ask, "Where did the Indians get their weapons?" The struggle between India and Britain is completely an unequal match.</p>
<p>I really dare not speculate on how much progress the Indian national rights movement can achieve. Nevertheless, seeing the Indian people's hard struggle, reclaiming the land day by day, and gradually overcoming their pain, is moving. Westerners call living in another country "eating the soul of that country." In this way, I should be considered someone who has eaten the souls of many countries, but I have not eaten the "salt of sorrow" of India. The salt commonly used in India is not produced in India, but is from the northeast tip of Africa. Although India has a long coastline, Indians do not extract salt from the seawater of the Indian Ocean. What is the reason? Because the Lancashire cotton industry does not allow it. The ratio of cotton imported by England from India to cotton cloth exported by England to India is eight to one. England loads cotton from India due to the imbalance of transport ships and loads African salt to India as an adjustment. However, due to the implementation of the salt monopoly in India, it is the ordinary people who suffer. Because the seasoning for ordinary people is only salt. In his later years, Gandhi advocated a salt-making movement and was arrested. This was not for India's self-sufficiency in food salt, but to symbolically expel British imperialism, that is, not to eat British salt.</p>
<p>Delirium Will Also Become Reality</p>
<p>I left India on a boat in disappointment. I wanted to observe the Indian national rights movement from the British perspective. A ship is a miniature of land. In the past, on sailing ships (Indiaman) going to India, there still remained the despicable, licentious maritime life of hypocritical Englishmen. However, what made me unforgettable forever was the confrontation between the two major peoples of India and Britain that unfolded on the returning steamer. As the only Japanese person on board, I was in a delicate position. On the first day of the voyage, the Indians determined my identity, and in the dining room divided into two camps, British and Asian, my seat was decided by them.</p>
<p>The British used insidious means to instigate Hindus and Muslims to attack each other, and greatly spread the word that the two religions were mortal enemies. The truth is not like this. In fact, the two religions are very friendly and loving. This was also the case on the ship. A lawyer named Muhammad sat in a group of Indian people without anyone objecting. And a Nepalese and I sat on either side of Muhammad. They all showed respect for me, a foreigner, and the Nepalese, a foreigner. The Asian camp was much friendlier than the British camp. Muhammad, who hoped to become a lawyer, talked and laughed and fully expressed the air of a senior, but he was not a remarkable person. What caught my attention was not him, but his younger brother Sati Muhammad. Sati was indeed a promising young man. He was very different from his brother, who hoped to become a lawyer. He went to England to study applied chemistry, a practical subject. His brother, who liked to argue endlessly, read the works of Shaw on deck, but Sati, whenever he had time, read the Quran, the holy book of Islam. He was truly a devout and faithful young man. We acted together until we arrived in London, and even after arriving in London, we visited each other.</p>
<p>But Sati was truly unfortunate. He could not get into any school. Although the British were not afraid of doctors and lawyers, they were quite unhappy about Indians studying applied chemistry. Because they did not want Indians to know the secrets of modern industry. Sati was greatly disappointed and went to the United States. Although I don't know what happened later, if he can learn what he wants to learn in the United States, he will still be greatly disappointed if he returns home and finds that there is no place for him to use his talents.</p>
<p>The British are so meticulous in preventing Indians from having the strength of an independent nation. Although the Indian people are in such a very unfavorable environment, the struggle against Britain is still continuing. The twenty years from the last war to this European war are the so-called "twenty years of unrest in India." There have been many bloody incidents. Nevertheless, the Indian national rights movement has not seen even a glimmer of hope. Whether one looks at this movement in India or in England, one will inevitably come to the conclusion that Indian independence is impossible. However, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War completely changed the situation. The delirium of Indian independence has entered the process of realization. This is truly a praiseworthy thing.

<h3>Social Insurance Bureau Held Anniversary Tea Party Yesterday, Exhibiting Insurance Charts and Photos</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has instantly reached one year. The mandatory labor insurance it has implemented has been widely launched in this city. In order to allow all sectors to understand the business situation of social insurance, the bureau specially held an anniversary tea party at Taixing Road Dulu Garden at 5 pm yesterday, to entertain leaders from all sectors of the city and owners of insured factories. Mr. Ding, Minister of Social Welfare, also personally attended to give instructions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Party Situation</p>
<p>Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Ding, personally participated on time, and was accompanied by Mr. Huang Xianggu, Director of the Bureau, Mr. Zhou Shuwang, Secretary, Mr. Guo Shuliang, Director, Mr. Pan Dingyuan, Specialist Commissioner, Mr. Xu Yukun, and other relevant authorities. Guests included Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Sun Mingqi, Mr. Gu Wangwu, Mr. Yuan Chang, Mr. Wu Wenwei, Mr. Chen Dongbai, Mr. Zhou Yuying, Mr. Zhang Kechang, Mr. Hu Shouqi, Mr. Li Shiyu, Mr. Guo Shun, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Ling Dating, Mr. Wu Huanru, Mr. Chen Binxu, etc., and representatives from various factories, no less than several hundred people. The municipal government specially sent representative Mr. Ling Wen to attend. The whole group observed the etiquette in the melodious sound of music, and then Director Huang presided over the speech. Afterwards, guests Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yuan Chang, Mr. Shao Heng, Mr. Qin Yizhou, etc., gave speeches in succession. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned after 7 pm.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Director Huang gave the opening speech as chairman, stating that today is the anniversary of the bureau's business promotion. He felt very honored to have guests from all walks of life and industry leaders present. Social insurance is a new policy in our country. Its purpose is to improve national health and stabilize the lives of workers. In the past year, with the assistance of various industrial circles, social insurance has been widely launched in this city. As of now, there are 2065 insured factories and 57,760 insured persons. The situation of various facilities of insurance business has been clarified in today's Shenbao and Pingbao Social Insurance Special Edition, and various statistical charts are also available on the spot. He would not repeat it, but hoped that all those present would give sufficient guidance, and hoped that they would continue to cooperate with past enthusiasm in the future, so that the social insurance system can be permanently and universally established in our country. This is what he hoped for.</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>After the opening speech, Minister Ding was respectfully invited to give a training speech, stating that social insurance is a kind of social welfare undertaking, and also a necessary measure for the country to implement social policies. The modern world is unanimously promoting it. Before the establishment of the social insurance system, social accidents and disasters could only be relied on by family relief, which was limited to providing emergency relief and saving lives, with limited results. Social insurance is different. It has the positive effect of improving national health, stabilizing the lives of workers, and solving practical social problems. Because the most important characteristic of social insurance is the "law of large numbers" to relieve the accidental damage of individual workers. That is, the owners pay a small amount of insurance for their insured persons, and there are also subsidies from the government. Together, they form a huge amount of money. When workers have accidental events such as illness, injury, or death, they will be compensated for their losses according to the severity of the disaster. In this way, the accidental burden of workers can be reduced or eliminated, and their lives can be stabilized. With a stable life, work efficiency and labor-capital emotions will naturally increase, and they will naturally strive to increase production. Moreover, in recent years, red communism has been lurking and active, taking advantage of the lack of knowledge and difficult lives of workers to implement their bewitching methods and set off labor unrest, which is enough to affect public security. Therefore, social insurance facilities are beneficial to all parties and the country and society. The Ministry of Social Welfare, in addition to promoting general labor welfare undertakings, later established the Social Insurance Bureau to take charge of this insurance, and its purpose is also here. The bureau has been promoting mandatory labor insurance in Shanghai for one year. In the past year, the industrial circles of this city have been able to cooperate with the government to promote contemporary social policies, and the results have been seen today. He felt very gratified. However, there are still a few points that he hopes all sectors will deeply understand: that some people currently think that the insurance premiums collected by the Social Insurance Bureau are all used for workers. The payment situation has been seen in today's Shen Ping two newspapers, which is completely different from ordinary donations and taxes. The reason why social insurance is implemented compulsorily is to increase national health and stabilize the universal effect of workers' lives. We have an analogy, which is the same as the meaning of the health authorities forcing citizens to get epidemic prevention injections. The authorities spend a great deal of money to give citizens injections for the sake of their health, so such compulsion is also out of goodwill. Today is the anniversary of the Social Insurance Bureau's business promotion. There are currently more than 57,000 insured persons. In the future, it is hoped that the industrial circles will continue to cooperate and promote this cause so that it can be developed more universally and complete the government's mission of promoting social policies.</p>
<p>Director Ling's Speech</p>
<p>Director Ling, the municipal government representative, said briefly: The Ministry of Social Welfare established the Social Insurance Bureau to promote labor insurance, which has been one year. Minister Ding has just explained the purpose and work of the bureau in detail, and the municipal government also attaches great importance to it. Shanghai is a district where industry and commerce gather, and there are many factories. In the past, the general factories provided too little labor protection. Although the First District Office of the Municipal Government also organized industrial welfare and labor welfare, it failed to achieve the ideal purpose due to various reasons such as funding. Now that the Ministry of Social Welfare has established a bureau to promote the insurance bureau's affairs, it is indeed a blessing to the factory industry in this city. After one year of work, the urgent needs of all parties are seen day by day. In fact, social insurance has achieved great results and has laid a considerable foundation. Now the production of labor in Shanghai is quite thin. It is hoped that the bureau's affairs will continue to be promoted in the future, so as to seek welfare for the general professionals in the society. The municipal government has high expectations for this.</p>
<p>Chart Exhibition</p>
<p>In addition to holding the anniversary ceremony and entertaining people from all walks of life, the bureau also drew charts or took photos of the administrative facilities of social insurance for public exhibition. The main ones include statistics on insured factories, industry categories, and insured persons, statistics on insurance premium income, statistics on the average burden of insurers and insured persons, medical statistics, payment statistics, comparison of business expense expenditures, photography of the treatment process of important diseases, comparison of disability production and injury, and statistical data on drug costs, totaling more than 40 types. The China United Film Company also sent personnel to take newsreels on the spot to make a general practical dissemination of the social insurance cause.</p>
<h3>Authorities Prepare to Increase Household Rice Rationing, Rice Imports More Prosperous Than Before</h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city has fallen sharply recently, and the price of miscellaneous grains has also fallen. The main reason for the decline in rice prices in this city is that the municipal government has abolished various restrictions on rice, so rice imports are more prosperous than before. In the first ten days of this month, it was 26,141 dan, in the middle ten days it was 33,952 dan, and in the last ten days it also reached more than 20,000 dan. Due to the increase in sources and abundant inventory, the price of rice in this city has fallen by more than 30%.</p>
<p>As for the new rice in the rice-producing areas that is about to be launched, and there is hope for a bumper harvest, farmers are selling off their stored rice, and the price of rice is even lower. In the Nanjing area, japonica rice is only worth 3,800 yuan per stone, and in the Dongting Lake area, it is less than 2,000 yuan per stone. Since the Allied forces have won victories in Hunan, the newly occupied areas are all rice-producing areas of the province, such as the counties around Dongting Lake and the lower reaches of Xiang, Zi, and Yuan Rivers. The annual rice output is more than 50,000 to 60,000 stones. Yueyang and Changsha are also major rice-producing areas. Most of the rice in this area can be transported to Shanghai, so the price of rice in Shanghai may continue to fall.</p>
<p>In terms of wheat production, the North China region has also had a bumper harvest this year. The average yield per mu in Hebei Province last year was about 118 catties, and this year it can reach 154 catties. The average yield per mu in Henan Province last year was about 100 catties, and this year it can reach more than 140 catties. Looking at the above situations, the national rice and wheat production has increased this year, the transportation is smooth, and the price of rice and wheat is expected to fall greatly. The rice and grain in this city will not be scarce. It is heard that the municipal authorities are preparing to increase the amount of rice rationed to households. All specific plans are being negotiated with relevant parties and will be implemented soon. The uneasy state of the people's rice supply will be swept away, and all parties are eagerly awaiting this.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Organization Submitted to the Government for Approval</h3>
<p>In order to promote municipal unity, the municipal authorities decided to move all important institutions to the First District Office on Jiangxi Road on August 1. The Municipal Finance Bureau was also ordered to move to the designated location in the First District on August 29. As for the issue of the transferred institutions, the reporter learned from the person in charge that in addition to the secretariat, the bureau will set up five sections: general affairs, taxation, collection, accounting, and special tax, to manage various affairs. Whether to set up the original accounting office will depend on the organization of the Municipal Government Accounting Office. The bureau has submitted it to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Special Rationing Flour Price to Increase, Household Flour Price to Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai District Flour Rationing Office of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee has carefully handled the flour rationing matters in the urban area, and the results have been good, which has greatly assisted the people's food supply. It is now learned that in view of the high price of rice, in order to reduce the heavy burden on the lives of the common people, after consultation, it has been determined that the rationing price of household flour will remain unchanged and will not be increased. In addition, for the special flour rationed to various industries, in addition to increasing the rationing quantity, the flour rationing industry categories will be divided into two grades. The rationing price of flour for the common people's flatbread, fried dough sticks, and porridge industries will be divided into the second grade, and the rationing price of flour for the high-end food industry will be divided into the first grade, which is 40% to 50% higher than the household flour rationing price, and will be implemented in the middle of next month.</p>
<h3>Food Sugar Rationing Issue Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office issued a notice to inform users of Special Group 1 (ie, former Type B retailers) to exchange for purchase certificates: "This office's 23rd term of special rationing sugar has been distributed. Except for users of Special Group 2, who will be notified by notification, all users of Special Group 1 (ie, former Type B retailers) must still come to the office to exchange for purchase certificates as usual. It is now scheduled to issue purchase certificates on July 31 and August 1. Hope that all users will bring the last red wholesale book, stamped with the store seal on the back, to exchange for purchase certificates within this deadline, and pay the payment to the designated sugar line before August 3, and then ship the goods. Those who do not come to receive the purchase certificates within the deadline, or those who have received the purchase certificates but do not pay the payment, will be deemed to have given up automatically, and the rationing will be cancelled. This is hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Nanshi to Distribute Brown Sugar to Pregnant Women</h3>
<p>Brown sugar is necessary for pregnant women. Since the first district began selling it, pregnant women have found it convenient. According to a reporter's investigation, in order to relieve the need for sugar among pregnant women in the Nanshi district, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has decided to implement rationing according to the population. Under the guidance of the Municipal Food Bureau, the entire Nanshi district will begin selling it. It is heard that each pregnant woman can purchase two catties of this brown sugar, selling for 100 yuan per catty in Central China banknotes, plus a purchase application form, and must have the joint guarantee of the Lianbao chief and a photo of the applicant attached to prevent currency flow.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Registration Prohibit Illegal Fee Collection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau has been strictly prohibiting staff from overcharging fees for vehicle registration.

Recently, as bicycle license renewals are being processed, the bureau specially notified all registration offices again yesterday to ensure that if there is illegal fee collection, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>

In the future, this air defense drill will be held from time to time, in order to be proficient and prevent unexpected events from happening.</p>

<h3>House Tax Assessment Based on a Fixed Standard</h3>
<p>Absolutely No Changes Can Be Made</p>
<p>Residents Must Not Be Deceived</p>
<p>The First District Office announced: The autumn housing tax this year will be re-assessed and collected from August 1st based on the situation in 1941. Someone has already contacted residents, saying that if a discretionary amount is given for "expenses", they can find a way to lower the assessment. The reporter was very suspicious and visited the Finance Bureau to ask about the matter. Director Yuan replied: The prices of all goods in Shanghai have risen, but rents have risen the least. Tax collection based on the rental rate cannot balance with other taxes. Therefore, it has been approved that starting from this autumn, the rents of Chinese and Western houses in the First District will be re-estimated according to the market situation in 1941. There is a fixed standard. The tax bills have already been written, and starting from August 1st, people will be sent to various places to collect according to the fixed amount. Absolutely no changes can be made. If anyone claims to be able to find a way to lower it, it is a pretext for deception. I hope citizens will not be deceived. If there is any disturbance, please call 14036 for notification.</p>
<h3>Short Commentary: The Importance of Wartime Social Policy</h3>
<p>The Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare held its anniversary celebration yesterday. This newspaper has also devoted space to publishing a "Special Issue on Social Insurance" in order to arouse attention to this social undertaking from all walks of life, especially the industrial sector. After reading the bureau's work report for the past year, we can understand the meaning of compulsory labor insurance and the protection for laborers.</p>
<p>Social insurance is still a pioneering effort in our country. At the beginning of its implementation, factory owners inevitably had an intuitive distrust of the "compulsory" nature of "compulsory labor insurance," and few people insured. Later, the bureau fully fulfilled its insurance obligations to the insured and achieved good results in its work, gradually arousing the attention and trust of factory owners, and the number of insured increased month by month. However, from the city's perspective, although insured factories account for more than half, the number of insured only accounts for one-thirtieth, which obviously failed to achieve the purpose of social insurance. Here, on the one hand, we expect the bureau to further show its achievements in its work and make the industrial sector understand and trust it; on the other hand, we hope that the industrial sector will automatically participate in insurance in order to stabilize the lives of workers, so that every worker will be insured by this time next year.</p>
<p>In wartime, in order to stabilize social order and increase social strength, social policies must be implemented. At the same time, social policies can be said to be a kind of obligation of the government to the people. It is an active way to enhance national strength, rather than a passive way to give grace to the people. If the government implements social policies from this perspective and the people cooperate in the implementation of social policies from this perspective, social stability and national rejuvenation will be achieved very well.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Explanation on the Difficulty of the Exam Questions</h3>
<p>The Reader Scholarship Office of this newspaper has recently received many letters from parents of applicant students, stating that some of the exam questions in this year's exam were never learned by the students, and asking for lenient marking so that they can pass. Before the exam questions were set this year, the office publicly solicited exam questions from various schools and received cooperation from most schools, which sent exam questions for reference. However, since the applicant students this year have been reviewed once by the school authorities and the office, and those who are allowed to register and participate in the exam are all excellent students in various schools, the difficulty of the exam questions was deliberately increased in order to select the particularly excellent among the excellent students.</p>
<p>Moreover, the topics of this year's exam are extensive, and the number of questions in each set of test papers is more than one hundred. Some of them are used for students in the second grade, and some of the test questions are based on higher grades, and it is not expected that most of the students in the lower grade can answer them. However, although the questions are the same for both grades, the passing standards are different. For example, it is an overestimation to think that "it is difficult to pass" because second-year junior high school students have not learned algebra. If most of the math problems that do not require the application of algebra can be answered correctly, and the scores in other subjects are also above average, then even if the algebra problems are not done at all, there is still a hope of being admitted.</p>
<p>Please Notify the Schools of the Number of Fees Charged</p>
<p>Schools that have students applying to this newspaper for scholarships must notify the office of the number of fees charged for the next semester. Most of the schools have already sent this notification, but some schools have not yet notified us. Please notify the office as soon as possible if the number of fees charged by your school has been determined but has not yet been notified. If it has not yet been determined, please notify us immediately after it has been determined.</p>
<h3>Sports: Tiyou Team in Shanghai, Defeats All-Star Team in Two Battles, to Face Western Combined Team Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The North China Tiyou Basketball Team's second campaign in Shanghai was against the All-Star Team. The match took place at 6:00 p.m. yesterday at the YMCA gymnasium in the Eight Immortals Bridge. The All-Star team, due to the illness of key players Wang Jinghu and Zhang Jinxuan, and Chen Xuechong's abstention, was like a leaderless group and fought like a plate of loose sand. Tiyou won again with a score of 45 to 32 in a one-sided situation. After the initial contact, Tiyou took the lead. Zhao Shoucheng scored the first point. The All-Star generals did not understand the strategy and often made mistakes halfway through. Tiyou continued to work hard. Guo Yongen's投籃 seemed to be divinely assisted. At the end of the first half, Tiyou took an absolute advantage with a score of 31 to 9. In the second half, Tiyou was sure of winning and confident. Therefore, it changed its strategy and adopted a rotation strategy, with a large number of fresh troops appearing on the stage. The All-Stars took the opportunity to counterattack. Although there was a time when they caught up, it was only a flash in the pan, and the battle was still controlled by Tiyou. Before long, time ran out, and Tiyou defeated the All-Stars with a score of 45 to 32. The expeditionary force won two victories in Shanghai in two battles. Tomorrow, it will face the Western Combined Team in the first battle, which will still be held at the original location.</p>

<h3>Science and Technology Symposium</h3>
<p>Integration of Science and Technology with Production</p>
<p>Inamura: Furthermore, there is another issue, which is that Japan's technology and science are not connected to production; they are entirely transplanted from foreign countries. Therefore, what Japanese scholars in science and technology research are foreign technologies and related university studies, and what scientists research is directly imitating foreign science. It does not benefit Japan's industry itself, nor does it provide the necessary technological research achievements for military production. At the same time, it fails to organically link basic science in universities, failing to create an integration of science, technology, and production. To achieve this, factories and control associations need to mediate and then connect with technologists. Problems that technologists perceive should be submitted to groups of scientists. Such an organically linked research approach may be the foundation for militarizing science and technology.</p>
<p>Ono: I think this is a very important issue. Scientists delve into ivory towers, engaging in research detached from real-world experience, while production facilities, no matter what difficulties they encounter, do not engage in scientific analysis. Both sides are useless. Germany even mobilized mathematicians to production facilities, so the theory of propellers is also very developed, and the products of production facilities are also very good. When the Soviet Union establishes a production plan, it mobilizes scientists, and from the perspective of scientists, it estimates the technological and productive capacity of a factory.</p>
<p>Reporter: The problems mentioned earlier, factories are factories, research laboratories are research laboratories. Perhaps these phenomena will gradually disappear!</p>
<p>Hanada: Last year, the Ministry of Education began ordering science and engineering students to go to factories and have them engage in as much factory practice as possible. However, it is not like before, going to the factory for internships, but working in the factory is the internship. This is an extraordinary measure during wartime. If thorough circulation can be carried out, the distance between the so-called scholars and factories will gradually disappear. Therefore, it is a very good phenomenon that graduating students fully understand what a factory is. We are silently praying for this.</p>
<p>If the talents from all aspects mentioned by Mr. Inamura can break down boundaries and unite in Japan, it would be a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Inamura: From the standpoint of education, mobilizing students this time is a very good thing. Science and engineering students even stop attending classes, letting them serve in factories for one or two years before receiving education, just like industrial education in Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and other countries. Anyone who wants to be a student in a college of engineering must first receive one or two years of practical education in a production facility. Only in this way can the integration of science, technology, and production be realized.</p>
<p>Ono: Therefore, viewing practical production from a theoretical perspective is always incompatible. If you theoretically review real-world problems, you are more likely to go in the right direction.</p>
<p>Inamura: Then that education will become talk.</p>
<p>Hanada: The biggest worry is that once you enter the factory, you will worry about not being able to engage in general education in all aspects. However, I don't think so. Suppose a college student also plays baseball, also plays tennis, also learns swordsmanship, and also learns judo, and all are half-baked. If this person can only do swordsmanship and has a fifth-degree black belt, the swordsman is still useful in case of an emergency. It is because of mastery. The same is true for factory internships. No matter how biased you are toward factory internships, it is good as long as you don't fall behind others in just one thing in the factory. So I say, no matter how biased you are towards one thing, it's okay.</p>
<p>Inamura: As for this time, science and engineering students participated in production and served as technicians in the field of telegraphs, and it will receive good results. It is said that the contribution of engineering students is unlimited.</p>
<p>Urgent Tasks of Science and Technology</p>
<p>Reporter: I have already learned just now that, for example, the militarization of science and technology is certainly very good for national policy and makes us very courageous, but are there obstacles when science and technology are militarized?</p>
<p>Inamura: How economic aspects need to be studied, [missing text] for further understanding. The reason is that current wars do not require any research. What is already known should be mass-produced continuously. This is very important. Especially during this critical period of the final battle, if we can move forward courageously in this way, it will definitely make a great contribution to the economic aspects. However, this war, especially the German-Soviet war, is waiting for a new advancement in science and technology to complete before conducting operations. In order to carry out an operation and in order to carry out a battle, we must wait for a certain new weapon or a certain new weapon to be completed, that is, the advancement of materials or the advancement of a machine, which often makes the war victorious. Therefore, we should know how important research and planned technological research are. Research influences the soul of our nation.</p>
<p>Fuji: I just talked about the example of Germany. Six or seventy percent of industrial technologists and even all personnel in Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, on the German side, technologists in research and development workshops (i.e., factories) and technologists in research laboratories account for more than half of all technologists. However, in such research and trial production [missing text], they do not consider the manufacturing process at all, and the technologist can only be considered to have finished his work when he is able to [missing text] into production. In the factory [missing text] only production technologists, that is, it can be transferred to the factory, because it can be carried out smoothly in the factory without many people. However, if the research and trial production room is separated from the factory, it will not receive good results. For example [missing text] has all the conditions that are out of the ordinary and are better than the best in the factory, and the things created by experienced people who can realistically produce and [missing text] technically apply will definitely be perfect. If we do not focus on research in this area, we dare not say that we are confident in this war. The enemy's weapon capabilities should also be known for sure. In order to do this, if we do not produce more advantageous weapons, we will fall behind in the next battle situation, so quickly hand it over to the research laboratory. This may not be resolved in the short term. If the country does not have considerable research technologists, then there will be no research and trial production that is all taken to the factory, and a big war will not be able to cope.</p>
<p>Reporter: I have taken up a lot of everyone's time, and all the questions have been discussed, so let's end the meeting here. (End) (Translated by Ji from the April issue of Japan Review)</p>

<h3>On the Current Grain Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhang Fengfeng</p>
<p>"The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is at peace." There are many ways to solidify the foundation, but the first priority is to stabilize the people's livelihood. There are many ways to stabilize the people's livelihood, but what everyone cannot lack and what is needed every day is food. Since ancient times, it has been recognized that "the people regard food as heaven," so the emphasis on food did not begin today. Even Premier Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood started by talking about the problem of eating, which is enough to show the dispensability of food. Eating is an important issue that everyone should have every day, so the first essential technique to stabilize people's livelihood is to provide the people with food. This is a definitive argument in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Because in wartime, only when the people's food supply is guaranteed can they be at peace, and then the rear can supply the front army with grain. The rear is not chaotic, so the chaos of the front can be avoided. Historical facts show that during the First World War, the German military system did not collapse and could have supported the precarious situation. There was still the last hope of winning, but the food panic caused a domestic revolution, which affected the front-line troops, forcing them to retreat, and ultimately leading to the armistice and peace. At that time, there were already signs of food control, with rudimentary measures. If in this war, countries further strictly implement food control policies, it is also sufficient to seek the extreme importance of food in wartime. It is indeed a universally recognized public opinion among the people of the world.</p>
<p>Our country has also implemented food control for some time, but with the evolution of current events, grain prices inevitably rise, especially since the spring of this year, the rising wind has been particularly strong. Taking rice, the most urgent grain, as an example, in Shanghai, the first wave rose to about 6,000 yuan per picul, and then fell back to about 4,000 yuan without further decline. Since the beginning of summer, the second wave of rise has exceeded 10,000 yuan, reaching a peak of 13,000 yuan in the last two decades. After effective measures during these two decades, it has only slightly fallen back, but it still hovers around 9,000 yuan. Compared with the 2,000 yuan last winter, 9,000 yuan is still quite different. However, after the people have been stimulated by the rapid rise, a slight fallback is regarded as nothing. In fact, rice is the leader of all food grains and can influence other commodity prices. The current maintenance of nearly 10,000 yuan per picul means that there is a serious food problem in the aspect of people's livelihood in terms of purchasing food and daily life.</p>
<p>It is an urgent task [missing text] to have countermeasures against the current food problem, which allows national public opinion to participate.</p>
<p>① Unified Purchase and Sale</p>
<p>The gains and losses and advantages and disadvantages of past food control policies are not discussed here. What is discussed here only concerns the limited views that I think are necessary to implement. One of them is unified purchase and sale. This means that the government should unify and organize a wide range of organizations to directly purchase all food material at fair prices from producers in production areas. The so-called comprehensive food material includes not only rice but also other six grains, as well as beans, tubers, and root vegetables. These are transported to public granaries in various places for storage, and then based on the principle of socialized distribution, they are allocated to households according to their regular needs. This is a principle. Its benefits are: first, it can thoroughly reduce grain merchants' hoarding and price manipulation; second, it reduces the unearned commissions in the middle; third, the people each enjoy the benefits of fair-priced grain, and the poor will not have to suffer the loss of purchasing in small quantities and constantly eating high-priced grain in the rising process, as before because they cannot afford to purchase grain in bulk. As for the implementation process, the government may investigate the situation in the production area, set a fair price for general food material, and entrust local grain merchants to purchase and store on behalf of the government when necessary by providing loans. Then, the government will add a considerable legal profit and move the goods from the respective merchants. If a loan has been made, the principal and interest of the loan will be deducted. The grain purchased in this way is transported to public granaries for storage. At the same time, it is sold in bulk to food stores in various places, and the stores register and distribute grain to each household according to the population and purchase grain certificates. The selling price should be in accordance with the regulations of the unified control organization, and a legitimate profit should also be added when setting the price. Such implementation has three benefits: first, it does not change the original commercial system; second, it maintains the existence of grain merchants, but gives them legitimate profits; third, it reduces the number of administrative personnel in the unified control organization, which can save a lot of expenditure. One thing that can be saved is the rice consumed in brewing [missing text]. The amount is actually very large. Instead of the people being greedy and still worrying about being insufficient, it is better to save this unnecessary consumption to enrich the essential food for the people. Therefore, in the future, please the government follow the example of saving electricity and saving coal (even production power elements are saved), and preserve [missing text], and also limit its use for brewing wine with rice, so as to transfer it to the normal consumption of food for the people. At the same time, limit the people's extravagance and excessive drinking.</p>
<p>Second [missing text] cakes [missing text] etc. [missing text] are folk customs during old festivals. It is the annual custom to make cakes, [missing text] or pastries. If they are supplemented as regular food, it may not be impossible. However, in fact, those who have money to make such food often use it as extra food in addition to regular food, as if they are eating sweets, drinking tea, and drinking alcohol. Those who are [missing text] often suffer from abdominal distension due to eating, which can also be said to be unnecessary or excessive food. It is also necessary to save consumption. To encourage this, please ask the unified control organization [missing text] to urge the food stores that are acting as distributors to strictly distribute food according to the household registration certificate, and do not exceed the entitled ration. In this way, even if it is still used to make such food, it is no longer used as the main food.</p>
<p>The above lists three policies. The first two explain more about the socialization of the source and distribution of unified control. The latter explains the necessity of saving in the time of food shortage. I believe that if these three policies are implemented, the source of food will be abundant, and the food for the people will be average. The food problem, even if it cannot be solved completely, can be greatly alleviated. I hope that public opinion will participate in the correction.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Sets Up Teacups on the Roadside</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers welfare undertakings run by the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society in this city have been known for their achievements. Recently, considering that rickshaw pullers run around under the scorching sun to earn a living, sweating profusely and thirsty, they have allocated 400,000 yuan to place 30 teacups on the roadside of various major roads starting from the 17th, contracted by hot water shops, to provide rickshaw pullers with drinking water every day, which is not a small blessing to the rickshaw pullers. The wooden frames of the teacups run by the association are painted with the name of the association and have slogans, advising rickshaw pullers to gamble, not to smoke, and not to drink. In order to prevent loss, they have already submitted a request to the Baojia authorities to instruct the Baojia self-defense personnel to pay attention to protection.</p>
<h3>Office Specialty School Study Experience</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shenbao Social Service Office, in order to meet social needs and train office personnel, specially founded the Office Specialty School, which exempts all tuition and miscellaneous fees. I signed up and was fortunately accepted, and entered Class A. The classes started on May 1st, and time passed quickly. Now, I will list my learning experience in the past three months as follows:</p>
<p>① Composition Method: Master Feng Shiquan explained his experience, with six necessities for composition, including Principal Huang's [missing text] eight standards for the school motto, [missing text] the author's writing is like his person, and the person is like his writing, with painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>② Brief Biographies of Celebrities: Letters [missing text] are the most true expression of human nature, and the selected letters are mostly exhortations, which can be helpful for self-cultivation. Professor Sun Deyu is proficient in elementary school and [missing text] on the vulgar characters and characters seen in customs, and his corrections are particularly numerous.</p>
<p>③ File Handling Method: This course makes a general discussion on the handling methods, which is quite critical, but I intend to go to major companies and institutions [missing text] to visit and practice on the spot, so that scholars can gain experience from theory, and their attainments will be more profound.</p>
<p>④ Official Document Format: There are many types of official documents, and it is the most important subject of the specialty school. Therefore, there are as many as three hours every week. There are no special books taught, and all the teachers rely on their own knowledge and experience to extract the essentials for teaching. Therefore, although [missing text] is very temporary, they can be generalized.</p>
<p>⑤ Service Morality: This course is taught by Mr. Yang Zhongyi, a master of Yi studies. It was originally scheduled to be Practical Ethics, but it was changed to Yi Li in the middle. It is profound and far-reaching, and many inventions have been made. Listening to it is very beneficial.</p>
<p>⑥ Calligraphy: Calligrapher Zhu Mingxin is in charge, detailing the origin of writing, calligraphy of past dynasties [missing text], how to hold a pen, and how to practice calligraphy, exploring the origin, teaching tirelessly, and making rapid progress.</p>
<p>⑦ Japanese: All that is taught in this course is ordinary conversation. I had already learned Japanese before, so although this course feels too shallow, it is still beneficial to review the old and learn the new.</p>
<p>⑧ Bookkeeping and Shorthand: Originally, there was only a bookkeeping class, which made a general explanation of ordinary accounting techniques. Later, it was changed to shorthand, which was personally taught by Ma Shujian, who invented the shorthand technique, and now the method of teaching is twice the result with half the effort. [Missing text] and cited extensively, so that students can easily understand. In short, although it is only a short three months, the basics of office work are generally available. As for how to carefully consider each word, and how to make the order clear, how to climb [missing text], remove leaves and preserve [missing text], it is up to the students to humbly learn and constantly [missing text]. [Missing text] School into [missing text], see the beauty of the palace walls, and the office specialty class, understand that it is a shortcut to Zhongnan (Zhang Zhongwei)</p>
<h3>Free Places</h3>
<p>① Southern Elementary and Middle School at No. 660 Fengyang Road feels that the tuition fees have increased sharply, and there are many who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, it has set up free places, tentatively set at a total of 30 elementary, junior, and senior high school students. All those who are from poor families and have aspirations can apply to the school.</p>
<p>② Shuxin Free Night School, in order to benefit poor students, enrolls new students in grades one, two, and three of junior high school. All tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, and books are borrowed from the school. Registration starts on August 1st, from 7 to 9 pm every night. Exam dates are August 5th, 6th, 19th, and 20th. Please bring your citizen card when registering. School address: No. 1, Lane 72, Zhangjia Garden, Jing'an Temple Road, Taixing Road, inside Guangming Elementary School.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Deceased Daughter Donation to Help the Good</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shiyuan wrote: "Six years ago, my job was stopped, the environment was bad, the room was narrow, and the air was turbid. My little daughter Baolian died in this situation. My heart is depressed, and I have never stopped. I often think [missing text] to integrate several sums of money and donate to help poor children, thinking of it as a memorial for my daughter. It has been delayed until now to realize it. Now, in addition to donating 1,000 yuan to the News Daily as [missing text] fund, and 1,000 yuan to the Xinpu Nursery Home as medical expenses for poor children, I have also sent 1,000 yuan to donate to your agency's aid for poor children. Knowing that it is a drop in the bucket, it will not help, but it is a memorial for my deceased daughter, and slightly reduces my grief."</p>
<h3>Receipt Report</h3>
<p>① Midwifery Fund: Zhu Changli (moved the full moon celebration banquet for Ling Lang to help) 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>② Poor Children's Aid Fund: Zhou Shiyuan 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>③ Poverty Relief Fund: Lu Tongyan 1,000 yuan, Charity Sale (Wu Guandai's Collecting Zhizhi Painting and Zheng Banqiao's Regular Script Hall Painting) 1,750 yuan, Total received above: 2,750 yuan.</p>
<p>④ Shanghai Housekeeping Agency Expands Business Shanghai Housekeeping Agency has newly opened sewing, embroidery, weaving, calligraphy and painting, and entrusted five departments. If social figures have the above needs, they can go to No. 11, Lane 239, Taicang Road (Pope Road), Old No. 8 District, Shanghai, to contact the agency. Time: 2pm to 6pm. The profits will be used as charity.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Ocean</p>
<p>(Seven) Tears and Blood</p>
<p>"In a word, the history of the imperial submarine is truly a crystallization of blood and tears. And it has not fought a single battle. Not once has it received the reward of blood and tears."</p>
<p>The Colonel said in a deep and painful tone, but suddenly changed his words:</p>
<p>"Just now [missing text] I told you about the sunken submarine that could not be rescued. I have arbitrarily said that the attitude of the crew members is [missing text] quiet. On the surface, it seems contradictory, but the fact is definitely not so. I have considerable reasons to prove that what I said is correct. In short, submarine service personnel have the spirit of submarine service. Whether in the past or now, the Imperial Submarine's service has this spirit. What is that pursuit, this spirit? When, and where, was it born? It is necessary to recall the first disaster that occurred on the sea off Shin [missing text] thirty-two years ago on April 15, not long ago. At the time of the first disaster, the spirit of the Imperial Submarine service personnel—the spirit that submarine crew members must have—was established on [missing text] solid foundation."</p>
<p>Without [missing text], this is the story of Commander Sakuma. It is the story of the No. 6 service member.</p>
<p>At that time, the Imperial Submarine was still in its infancy. It was more like a small boat than a boat. Problems often occurred, and the boat trip was very short, so it was always afraid to stay away from the mother ship. This is because it is a toddler who has just learned to walk. When going out, because there is no kitchen, the crew members have to bring their own food. It is only a few days from No. 1 to No. 9, a total of nine [missing text]. Now there is no need to use leaf-shaped objects to surround the outside [missing text], but to [missing text] raise [missing text] on the sea surface. As for surface navigation, gasoline engines are used.</p>
<p>Among them, the No. 6 boat is the smallest, with a tonnage of only 57 tons, and there is no such thing as a bridge. The place where the commander of the boat is located during navigation is only two feet away from the water surface. When the internal [missing text] boat passes by, the waves will hit the body and wet the body. Therefore, the No. 6 boat is not allowed to participate in exercises and patrol boats.</p>
<p>When Lieutenant Sakuma was ordered to be the commander of the No. 6 boat, it was December of Meiji 42, but he had previously served as the commander of boats No. 1 to No. 4, and had specialized knowledge of submarines. At the same time, he had participated in the Russo-Japanese War and served on cruisers and torpedo boats. He showed his skills in Lushun and the Sea of Japan and established the military's great achievements. His hometown is Fukui Prefecture, and his father is a Shinto priest. It is said that he is very rich in a sense of obligation and strong perseverance.</p>
<p>When the Lieutenant was serving on the No. 6 boat, he had made up his mind to make the most of this most incomplete submarine. At that time, submarines had made all efforts, and there were very many research topics. However, the topic can only be solved by the sacrificial spirit of the service personnel. (126)</p>
