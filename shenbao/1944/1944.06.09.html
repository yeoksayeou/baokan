<p>中華民國三十三年六月六日　主任委員袁履登</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>實行簡政</h3>
<p>近頃中樞政治，漸有進步趨向。同時，名部負責人，也各有努力於本　的趨向。我們一貫主張政治革新並期望政治修明，對此進步的趨向，非常欣幸。可是，就整個政治修明的目標而言，若干進步的趨向，僅是走向修明之途的開端，而達到修明的終點，自然更需要繼續不斷的努力。我們認爲目前最重要者如治安·生產·敎育諸問題，在在需要運用政治力量以克服困難。而克服困難問題，尤非當局具備最大決心不爲功，尤非澈底革新不爲功。若干進步的趨向，還是不够，還是無濟於事。</p>
<p>進一步說，中樞政治漸有進步趨向，對於地方政治自能發生領導與影響作用。同時，對於大東亞戰爭的勝利，也可增加信念。這是精神方面的成效。</p>
<p>其次，物質方面同樣重要，而不可偏忽。試舉一例，凡服務於政府機關者，同屬公務人員，其待遇應盡可能一律平等。譬如服務於國家銀行的職員，與監察考試敎育司法等行政機關的職員，待遇相差，顯示不平。我們始終認爲公務人員待遇，一定使之溫飽，足以養　，則一切政治上的弊　漏洞，可心在無形中減少。如果中樞當局明知公務人員待遇低劣，生活艱苦，而不　根本改善之道。一方面對於違法舞弊不加嚴格糾正，則無異放任。這樣，政治革新就絕少可能性，若干的進步趨向，也不能持之恒久，恐將形成曇花一現而已。</p>
<p>我們前曾提出過精兵與簡政兩點，在目前治安問題頗感重要之時，在目前中樞政治漸向進步之時，精兵與簡政，尤感迫切需要。因爲，不能精兵，反足以擾亂治安；不能簡政，反足以促使政治不上軌道。這是近數年來政治上的經騐，不可否認的事實。而簡政更是政治上物質改善的必要途徑。因爲重床疊架的駢枝機關，以言行政效率，則徒足以彼此牽制，躭誤時間，根本無效率可言。另一方面，因爲駢枝機關的設置，就增加閑散冗員，消耗經費，實際上駢枝機關，在行政上幷不必要，因此所消耗的經費，就是佔奪其他必要機關的經費。同時，冗員所支的薪費，也就是佔奪其他必要公務員的薪費，因爲有了駢枝機關與閑散冗員，就減少了必要機關的經費與必要公務員的薪費，這是行政效率趨於低落的主因，也就簡政必要的理由。</p>
<p>就上海市而言，公務人員總數達二萬五千餘人（第一區公署及保安處尙未列入），以目前物價指數，使此龐大數量的公務人員及其家屬咸得生活安定，市府收入，是否可能，確成問題。所以，我們主張，市府所屬機關的合併，冗員的裁汰，殊有檢討調整的需要。市府各局處如能合署辦公，至少對於每局處辦理總務人員可以減少，這是一例。其次，第一區公署與市府之間，組織上頗有重複之處，實有提早合併之必要。而以裁汰節餘之經費，增加必要公務人員的薪費，以提高行政效率。</p>
<h3>國府宣戰佈吿</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂，乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，及益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，且嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平發，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：面英美對於東亞處心積虎，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以　遂其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府爲此宣吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友幫日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心。今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序，德義諸友幫，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋。迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此爲實現　國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之獲得，胥緊於此。其一德一心，戳力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>
<p>中華民國三十二年一月九日　主席　汪兆銘</p>
<h3>日機襲必阿克島　擊毀運輸船二艘　水濱敵陣地亦發生大火災</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　必阿克島一帶之攻奪戰，日漸熾烈，日空軍協力陸軍，連日大肆活躍，或襲擊敵艦艇，或攻擊敵陣地，收獲莫大戰果。二日下午曾在該島沿岸擊毀敵運輸船二艘，一艘爲中型者，使其登陸設施二處發生火災，更擊落前來挑戰之B25型機二架，日機一架未歸還。六日夜更轟炸該島水濱敵陣地，使其發生大火災，日機全隊安返基地。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據有戰車利砲之敵軍約一師，五月十六日在新幾內亞特爾河河口一帶登陸，該地日軍對此曾於五月二十七日至六月二日反覆加以猛攻，卒迫其一部向該地瀕海之瓦庫迭島潰竄。同時，日軍在沿岸殲滅其主力，撲滅其重砲陣地，日軍刻在該地附近之密林掃蕩殘敵中。截至現在止，已判明之戰果，計消滅敵軍不下一千人，若包括其負傷者在內，則其損失將超過三千人。此外，日機隊亦對該地附近之敵停機處猛攻，五日夜半曾轟炸瓦庫迭島，此次轟炸所獲戰果，因在夜間，無從判明，但確曾予敵以重創。因敵被炸地點發生大火達二小時始熄，此種情形，由海岸方面可以看見。自此次轟炸以來，瓦庫迭島機塲，似已失其機能，因未見敵機自該機塲飛起也。</p>
<p>拉巴爾八日中央社電　五月三十日晨，於拉馬爾附近海上警戒中之日偵察機一架，曾發現敵魚雷艇一艘，當即加以犯攻，卒將之擊沉。同時，並擊落其戰鬥機二架。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營七日發表五月份之航空戰戰果如次：在各戰綫五月份敵機來襲之機數，累計三萬二千七百六十四架，約爲四月份來襲敵機數二萬四千零九十七架之一倍半，此數實爲開戰以來之最高紀錄，而五月份日方損害，則較四月份爲少（按四月份損害架數爲一百七十五架，五月份爲一百十一架），此種數字，實足以證實日空軍戰績之超越，茲誌各戰綫之戰鬥經過如次：</p>
<p>南太平洋方面　敵機來襲新幾內亞島之機數，累計爲一萬另六十七架，惟自五月以來，敵在新幾內亞島特爾河河口及必阿克島登陸時，敵空軍曾向登陸地點猛炸，故當時日守備部隊，即以寡敵衆，奮起應戰，而其戰果亦因此而倍見增加。　波根維爾島敵機仍不斷來襲俾斯麥羣島，如於波根維爾島方面敵機來襲機數，遠較四月份爲多，其根本原因，實由於該島日守備軍在敵進攻路上，形成高度之威力圈，於是敵軍不能以地上部隊進行攻擊，是故敵軍爲壓制日軍所形成之威力圈，乃以優勢空軍反覆來襲。　班達海面敵機來襲狀況，與四月份大致相同，在南太平洋全域，共擊落敵機二百二十八架，擊毀及擊燬一百六十架，合計三百八十八架。</p>
<p>中太平洋方面，與四月相較，五月份來襲之敵機較少，但仍爲連日空襲，毫不間斷，其戰果計擊落敵機一百十三架，擊燬四十八架，合計一百六十一架。</p>
<p>緬甸方面四月來襲之機數，爲七千三百六十四架，五月遞增至一萬六百八十六架，敵因進攻伊姆法爾之降落傘部隊及富貢方面地上部隊，陷於不利狀態，故空軍愈益加強，對日軍第一綫施以雨彈之轟炸，並對日軍後方補給路作反覆執拗之襲擊，因而空軍反攻亦隨之激烈。較諸四月份一百四十架之戰果，五月亦激增，計擊落其一百零七架，擊毀及擊燬九十架，合計一百九址七架。</p>
<p>中國方面五月份敵機蠢動次數，較四月倍增，其原因係由於日軍展開河南作戰及華中方面新作戰，駐渝美空軍之不斷跳樑所致，日空軍除予以痛擊外，並長驅進攻敵空軍基地，擊落敵機四十五架，擊燬一百十五架，合計一百六十架，獲得偉大戰果。</p>
<p>北太平注方面來襲敵機總數無變化，該地敵軍之企圖，毫未得逞。</p>
<h3>日橫山情報官　談侵歐作戰　認德軍必獲最後勝利</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日內閣情報局第三部橫山情報官，七日對中滿記者團談稱：吾等對今次反軸心軍之歐洲侵攻作戰，並無多大關係，德軍自一九三九年開戰以來，即料及此役之必展開，早已有萬全準備。今次作戰，乃爲決定敵方存亡之關頭，故預測彼等必使其大量物資成爲戰力化，並實行人員之總動員，以作最後之掙扎，因此侵攻將繼續至何時雖難預測，然於今日之過程中，德國國民雖逢重大關頭，咸能一一將之毅然克服，以其民族光輝之傳統情神爲背景以近代科學及優秀無匹之軍隊，而拚命奮鬥，故將來最後之勝利當歸德國。德國國民對歐洲之安全與自國之安全，皆同樣關心，守護歐洲即守護自國，以此種堅決信念，必能壓倒英美。反之，敵方復以侵佔疆土之野心，圖伸展其勢力，此與德國之必勝精神，實不能相比，歐洲戰爭與大東亞戰爭，名雖不同，但一言以蔽之，該二種作戰，故爲日·德兩國之共同作戰，故今次侵攻作戰，由日本視之，實不得不予以最大關心，德軍把握此千載難逢之良機，於巧妙之作戰計劃下，必將澈底殲滅頑敵，於茲非僅日本國民爲之虔誠祝福，確信全東亞民族亦必如是。</p>
<p>堀切大使談話</p>
<p>新京八日中央社電　日前駐義大利使堀切，於此間發表談話如次：宣傳已久之侵歐作戰，終於歐陸展開矣。德軍已完全使該地要塞化，以逸待勞，粉碎敵人上陸企圖，自在意料中，且由於東部戰綫之撤退，戰綫已無形縮短，更以義大利戰綫縮短關係，今後更易發揮其彈性作用。今後將如何演變，雖不敢預斷，然德軍絕對持有自信，將使鄭寇克之悲劇重演，本人願於此爲盟邦德軍將兵祈禱。</p>
<p>日研究開發南方資源</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　南方自然科學研究所，爲開發及研究南方豐饒之資源，該所長三歸伊八郎統率下之農業，林產，木產，鑛物，石油，醫藥，經濟各部研究員約四十名科學戰士，鑑於時局任務之重大，特加強研究工作，近並爲擴充及整備起見，經商得陸軍文部兩當局之同意，特於六月內，在該所農學部設置各研究所，該所與共榮圈各地研究機關相互連絡及交換研究事宜。又農業，林產，水產，鑛產，石油，醫學，衛生，藥學部門專任研究員，亦均正式決定。目下新設之研究科目及目下進行調查研究中之主要目標如次：關於熱帶產物纖維油脂作物種類栽培之研究。　關於木炭及飛機造船等特殊用材之研究。　於移動及定住所魚類水棲狀態及適應食糧方法研究。　關於南方資源開發之研究。　石油地帶之層位學個性學之研究　關於開採地質之研究。　關於日本民族適應南方之研究。　疫病之預防及病理研究。　衣食住產業等都市衛生之研究。　熱帶藥草之研究及病理學之確定。</p>

<h3>奧納河兩岸德軍獲進展</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據來自法北部被侵入地區之報吿稱：日昨午後德軍向侵入奧納河以東之敵軍展開劇烈之反攻，迫使敵軍後撤，該河之西，德軍亦已發動有效之反攻，德軍將敵坦克隊之衝鋒隊數部份擊毀，該戰區之北，德軍對敵方準備出攻之坦克軍隊展開反攻，德軍於是處激戰獲得拓展，諾曼第半島北部喀侖淡戰區中，美軍刻正企圖擴大其立足點，該區刻正在激戰中。</p>

<h3>米蠧企圖暴利　盼市民檢舉　日大使館當局表示協力</h3>
<p>邇來滬市糧食，因來源不暢，價格高漲，影響民生非鮮，現經市政當局之積極努力，米價已逐漸向平，惟仍有少數奸商及不良份子，企圖暴利，竟敢再事高抬或欺凌販米人夫，沿途强施勒索，殊堪痛恨，各方對此均極注意，市府已令飭所屬認眞查緝。陳市長，實業部長陳君　，昨（八日）分別發表談話，希望市民協助當局，隨時檢舉，肅淸破壞糧政，操縱居奇之不良份子，以期安定民生，同時日大使館當局亦表示決予協助。茲錄談話如左：</p>
<p>陳市長談話</p>
<p>最近滬市糧食，因來源不暢，價格高漲，致影響民生，中央深為注意，業經命令米統會及各地政府獎勵採辦，疏通來源，以日來來價已逐漸回平，惟據報仍有少數奸商及不良份子，藐視功令，企圖暴利，竟敢再事高抬，或欺凌販米人夫，沿途强施勒索，殊堪痛恨，市府軍警當局，業已奉命各就轄區分隊查緝，據第二警察局報稱，已於日昨先後捕獲此種案犯七八人，在嚴密訊究中。第一警察局，亦已獲得綫索，正在繼續查緝，足見連日米市仍屬操縱有人，此種奸徒非嚴予懲處，不足以儆刁頑，而安民食，深望本市市民協助當局，努力檢舉，庶奸宄，無所遁形，米價得以安定，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>陳部長談話</p>
<p>關於疏通來源，充裕滬市民食，各種具體辦法，已在關係機關積極推進中，嗣後食糧之供應，自能趨於好轉，惟據各方報吿，對於米糧運銷間有不良份子從中作祟，此等奸宄之徒，不予懲治，則糧政前途，荊棘橫生，危害民食，莫此為甚，市府對於居奇操縱勒索留雜，散播謠諑，破還糧政者，早已三令五申，以防效尤，今複嚴加取締，藉敬冥頑，一般市民應念及切身利害，協助當局，隨時檢舉，相信在政府與民衆協力下，當前之糧食問題不難順利解決也。</p>
<h3>日大使館當局談話</h3>
<p>上海關係當局，鑒於本月初米價飛騰，傾舉全力，以謀民食安定之對策，同時並查緝不良份子，囤積暴利之暗中活動，市政府當局，曾將涉有操縱米價嫌疑者數人，予以檢舉債查，並表示一俟判明，確有非法行為時，定當予以嚴厲處分，且將繼續進行澈查，業經本日陳市長談話周知，而實業部方面亦發表同樣意義之談話，日本當局對於中國官憲之此種斷然處置，表示十分贊意，認為取締此種非法行為，對於食糧對策之成敗，關係至鉅，因此決盡力協助以底於成功，盼中日民衆及其他關係方面，務須嚴誠切勿有囤積暴利等行為，致使會糧問題，趨於惡化而干罪戾。</p>

<h3>今日六次防空日　實施各項訓練　今晚訓練空襲燈火</h3>
<p>今（九）日為六次防空日，昨據市民防空本部負責人語中央社記者稱：「防空日」實施以來，已歷半載，市民之深切關懷及防空技術之日見進步，殊堪地欣慰。上月末二日在陸海軍防空司令部指導下舉行之防空訓練，堪為反映過去半年訓練成績之絕佳機會，本部深願與市民共同檢討是二日之成績，幷益加磨勵發奮邁進，實所至盼。」茲將第六次防空日應注意事項列後：</p>
<p>燈火管制</p>
<p>上次訓練成績，為歷來最劣之紀錄，明日（六月九日）第六次防空日，亟應注重燈火管制，按照下列要點縝密施行，務望市民特別注意，幷希保甲目警團對於各種管制之相互轉變，均能懇切指導。（甲）時間：自薄暮時起至下午九時止，現行之通常燈火管制。目下午九時起至下午十時止，計一小時，訓練空襲燈火管制。自下午十時起至下午十時三十分止，計半小時，訓練空襲燈火管制。下午十時三十分以後，回復通常燈火管制。（乙）此次不鳴汽笛，各防空團常於上開時刻搖鈴或錘鑼，幷高聲傳呼。（丙）對於天窗老虎窗及高大房屋尤須特別注意。（丁）警戒警報中，路燈均予開亮，惟以此次防空日為限。（突襲警報發令後則仍須熄滅）（戊）留用之燈在訓練突襲警報中，必須關滅，惟在訓練警戒警報中，則仍燃亮。</p>
<p>一般訓練</p>
<p>各種個別訓練為綜合訓練之基礎，通常反對高處射水法，暨三角巾。綳帶等之使用法，其所有個別動作，尙須依照正確方法，再行實習</p>
<p>通信連絡</p>
<p>上次訓練成績，殊為惡劣，防空時每多不能僅藉一小部份防空團活動而奏膚功，故鄰近防空團之相互連絡，以及與軍政機關之通信運絡，均須敏捷施行，此層至。為重要，務希深切注意。有關軍政機關之所在地點與市話號碼等，均須牢記勿忘，幷應多備曾受訓練之連絡人員，於電話不能使用時出動應付，至於通信連絡，雖再三重複，亦幷下嫌多繁。</p>
<p>救護訓練</p>
<p>止血法尤須充分練習，人身每滴血液，咸與生命有關，倘使賴形式上之訓練，決難挽救生命之危境，故各防空團均有熟諳止血法與應急措置等之必要。所有担架，為數甚少，應僅用於身受重傷之人，至於輕傷者，應使其步行或用人力車載送。槪括而言，頭部胸部及腹部所受之傷，可認為重傷，副本之準備，雖向感不足，遇有骨折時，務須使用之。最後所欲申述者，為梯子担架等防空器材之檢點，本部雖屢次促請民衆注意，大都仍未予重視，列為遺憾。須知此項器材在預防及應付危機方面，裨助至鉅，務希市民在訓練前後，加以縝密之檢點為要。</p>
<p>今日為本市第六次防空日，市第二警察總局防空指揮部為促所屬各區市民對於防空之普遍認識起見，決定在各該區內分別舉行救火滅彈及救護等訓練演習。同時對於交通及燈火，亦將予以嚴密管制</p>
<h3>周財長陳實長等　會商統制政策</h3>
<p>關於强化統制機構圓滑物資之交流，以及米糧調節穩定民食，為一般官民所嚴予重視，國民政府曁有關各當局，正積極連絡硏商其體調整方策，實業部陳部長，於日前來滬，連日與關係方面密切商洽中。茲悉防政部長兼物資統制審議委員會委員長周佛海氏，亦於日前來滬，對於上項諸問題，正與滬上經濟實業界領袖，商冶强化步　，聞周陳兩部長，將於最近期內，會同小倉最高經濟顧問，共商調整物資統制整個方策。</p>

<h3>今日足球賽</h3>
<p>本報第七屆助學金業已開始辦理，以目前物價情形，預計本屆需要助金數量更大，擬以一千萬元為目標，分向各界呼籲捐助。並舉辦足球義賽，定於今日下午五時半在跑馬癮球塲舉行。承東華與僑聯兩足球隊熱心參加比賽，上海足球聯合會上海體育會等有關方面竭力協助，跑馬廳偕用塲地，認購榮譽劵諸君慷慨輸助，非常感謝。</p>
<p>其次，最普遍而同樣感謝熱忱者，就是今天到塲的觀衆諸君。在諸君的熟烈情緒之下，將使千百淸寒學生獲得繼續學業的機會，間接替國家社會培育人才，相信諸君如能從此方面推想，必然感覺心安理得。不過，今天我們對諸君特別諸求的，就是在進塲入口之時，絕對遵守秩序，不致有過去球賽中紊亂情形，因為諸君或許是一時情緒熱烈爭先恐後，可是秩序亂後難免發生意外，如果因而對於塲地有物質上的損失，則賠累所支，就是減少助學金的收入，我們相信決非諸君所願為的。於此，誠懇提出：</p>
<p>請求觀衆諸君，遵守入口秩序。</p>

<h3>特洛基那補給戰</h3>
<p>於建軍七十年的歷史上劃一新紀元的船舶兵，自從去年出戰以來，即不斷在南溟第一線的血戰中活躍。為了擊滅特洛基那的敵軍，在敵機的跳梁及魚雷艇的襲擊下，由舟舶機動展開補給戰，將巨炮·彈藥·糧　送上前線，「海的陸軍部隊」船舶兵的奮戰苦鬥，眞是罄難盡。下面所述的，便是「海的陸軍部隊」的精銳在南海的怒濤中用血寫成的「海的凱歌」。</p>
<p>歸途遭遇戰</p>
<p>以大內少尉為艇隊長的兩隻發動艇和一隻武裝小發動艇，筆直向摩比那岬航行。天際沒有明月，祗有閃爍的星星，爪巴灣的海而平靜。從〇〇到〇〇的五十浬以及更從〇〇到〇〇的十五浬，都已平安無事地駛過了，且巳完成了輸送任務，現在他們是一路急急駛歸基地，但他們仍舊不得弛緩沉重的緊張感。</p>
<p>引擎聲迥盪波上，淸脆雖然情脆，却妨礙了聽取敵艦敵機聲者的工作。此時，三隻發動艇組成的艇隊已徐徐馳入敵方魚雷艇的出沒水域了。</p>
<p>這時，突然響起了瞿瞿兩聲長的笛聲。這是吿知魚雷艇出現的營戒笛聲。武裝艇艇長大塚曹長已在右舷四十度約六百米的前方發見了敵影。一隻，二隻，三隻……一共有五隻魚雷艇，急急駛來，甚至在夜色中也可看淸它們船頭所掀起的白浪。這怎麽可以放過，突進，向敵方魚雷艇展開先制攻擊！</p>
<p>「交戰準備——瞿！」大塚曹長的艇退即向右大轉　。砲手平江兵曹靜靜凝視着敵方第二艇。突進又突進。「放！」一聲號令，速射砲彈即曳着赤尾，直向敵軍第二艇猛撲過去。衝到彼我相距祗三百米的必殺戰法奏效了，第一彈便擊中了敵第二艇的艇腹，冒出了火燄，將海上照得通明。这時，敵第四艇以全速從燄烟中突出，不自量地要替同伴報仇；拍拍拍，吐出了一連串的曳光彈。這邊艇上的機關槍手淵上上等兵忽然中彈而倒。「讓我來吧！」高橋軍曹一把搶過淵上上等兵握住未放的槍柄。達達達，槍彈比雨還密，注向敵第四艇。</p>
<p>在我方決死的先制攻擊下，敵艇完全被制機先。欲作反攻的敵第四艇，也被取代負傷的平江兵長的野村一等兵一彈命中，在一百五十米的前方轉輾沉沒。</p>
<p>拚死肉搏</p>
<p>已經擊沉敵魚雷艇兩隻的大塚艇，士氣更加旺盛。轉眼一望，大內少尉指揮的一隻發動艇已將戰鬥委諸武裝艇，一直向基地疾駛。武裝艇於是可以毫無遺憾地完成其本來的任務，展開了勇猛無畏的戰鬥。在它的右舷，似乎是一隻敵方的指揮艇；在它的左舷，敵第三艇冒着猛烈的砲火，直衝過來。轟隆隆，大塚艇搖幌不已。一彈，二彈，三彈，右舷尾部開了兩個大孔，左舷首部穿了一個大洞。海水汨汨浸入。但是怕浸水的決非「海的陸軍部隊」。艇上人員一面設法阻止海水浸入，一面直迫敵第五艇。在千鈞一髪的當兒，兩艇相距不過十五米，大塚艇長的手槍突然狂鳴，全體艇員像一塊熟鐵，預備跳到敵軍的魚雷艇上去。敵第五艇看到這種汹汹的聲勢，趕緊掉頭遁走。餘下的指揮艇和第三艇也徑不起大塚艇瘋狂似的猛攻，張起彈幕，向海上逃跑。</p>
<p>下午六時五十分起至五十五分止的五分鐘的戰鬥中，擊沈了兩隻敵軍的魚雷艇，但大塚艇也中砲彈三處，機關砲彈八處，浸人的海水刻刻增加，最後大塚艇長紙好下令「擱淺登陸」。艇上的勇士雖都浴着鮮血，但槍砲却全部無怎。善欲於來日的戰鬥中復仇的大塚艇長，聲稱無論如何要將槍砲起卸到岸上。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，頭上傳來了一陳隆隆的敵機聲。接着丟下兩顆照叫彈，將四周照得如同白晝一樣明亮。在無可隱藏的明亮中，大塚艇便很淸楚地浮在海面上。於是三顆炸彈接連落了下來。可是幸運得很，三顆炸彈都落在水上，徒然掀起三個水花。全體艇員不覺歡呼萬歲。不久，槍砲便都平平安安地起卸上岸。</p>
<p>子夜血戰記</p>
<p>「海的陸軍部隊」的悲壯戰鬥並未就此吿終。在一星期不到的二月廿五日，不知悔改的敵人又以魚雷艇十五隻以上，飛機五架以上，出巡黑夜的海上，打算切斷日軍的補給綫。是日的戰鬥，於下午五時在卡寨萊灣開始。</p>
<p>以進藤隊北澤少對為艇隊長的四隻發動艇和一隻武裝小發動艇，為了將軍需品送往〇〇，待至夜色蒼茫時，從〇〇的舟艇秘匿地向〇○出發。武裝艇上有久經沙塲的指揮者雄武富曹長，以及艇隊長北浮少尉，他們張大了烱烱的眼睛，仔細警戒着。其後是西崎軍曹的西崎艇，三宅軍曹的三宅艇，西軍曹的西艇，西軍曹的西艇。若十名的健兒，意氣冲天，在艇隊長的指揮下，開始航行。</p>
<p>不料出發之後不久，堀田艇的機關部忽然發生故障。西畸艇立刻去下　索，曳着它走，一面拼命修理。這時，兩隻敵魚雷艇遠遠破浪駛來攻擊。「媽的，不要命的冒失鬼！」北澤艇隊長咬緊牙齒，下令開砲。交戰約十分鋒，敵艇向海上敗退。但至七時二十分，敵人開始第二次的攻擊。兩隻敵魚雷艇向這時拖着堀田艇向〇〇疾駛的武裝小發動艇挑戰。武裝艇迅即解下曳航索，完成應戰姿態。堅信先制攻擊為勝利之鍵的「海的陸軍部隊」，艇首吐出猛烈的砲火，一直肉薄敵魚雷艇。懾於這種敢死的衝鋒，敵艇無心戀戰，開始向遠洋遁走，但一顆機關槍彈竟偶然地命中武裝艇的腹部。艇員雖則加緊修理，以備其次的戰鬥，但海水不斷湧人，終於使機關部也不能活動了。全體艇員無奈祇好裸體跳入海中，負着武裝艇，向岸泅去。靠着名不虛傳的狂濤掀起三米餘駭浪的成力，武裝艇是擱淺了。北澤艇長不得已將武裝艇和堀田艇留在該處，率着在餘三艇急急向〇〇航行。駛抵目的地一望，〇〇正在敵砲火中熊熊燃燒，加以狂濤駭浪汹湧澎湃，一時殊難起卸上陸。</p>
<p>海空夾攻</p>
<p>掉轉艇首，不料有敵魚雷艇兩隻迎面駛來，開砲轟擊。更不利的是○〇河口附近上空敵軍的康案里寶的特轟炸機正在盤旋。北浮艇隊長持滿不放，在照明彈下，鎭靜地安排一切，等待擊滅敵人的機會。在明如自養的照明彈光下。看淸楚正有數隻魚雷艇扼住了進路。這時，康索里竇的特轟炸機關開始丟擲炸彈，並用機槍掃射。「好，打它下來！」對空戰鬥的第一彈瞬即射出。同時向前面最右翼的三隻魚雷艇猛衝。海的「白刃戰」置重點於敵第一艇。猛烈的集中砲火果然擊燬了第一艇。於是改向襲擊第二艇，它即刻遭到和第一艇相同的命運。敵軍第三艇看到這種果敢的捨身戰法，心胆俱碎，急急逃走。但連舒氣的閒暇也沒有，另外又有二隻大型魚雷艇出現。在決死的猛攻之下，立刻使其一隻起火焚燒。可是敵軍的戰意也很旺盛，尤其在得到飛機的協助時，它們的槍砲密如連珠。友軍一號艇上，西崎軍曹的顏面和左大腿部已負了傷弄得渾身血汚，但仍奮戰不退。三號艇上，西澤上等兵及島田，江口兩一等兵也已負傷。而浴血奮戰的深田上等兵終於一聲慘呼，倒在砲側。</p>
<p>好容易將餘下的大型魚雷艇擊退之後，不料又有三隻魚雷艇擋在前面。怎麽辦呢？它們旣不開砲，也不放槍，祇是沈默着。奇怪了，它們的意圖何在？在疑雲重重中，我週的艇隊不管三七二十一地繼續挺進。陰慘的沈默並未長久保持下去。敵機飛來了！同時敵魚雷艇羣也開砲猛轟。</p>
<p>這時，不幸光臨我們的艇隊。砲彈已用罄了，無奈祗有用機關槍應戰。北澤艇隊長一而繼續猛射，一面肉搏敵艇。一度沸騰了的鬥志在未曾殲滅敵軍以前，決不消滅。</p>
<p>互有損傷</p>
<p>如此的海上苦戰。從二十五日夜裏十一時半一直繼續到早上一點鐘。遁走的敵人以後又於拂曉二時及三時二十分再來挑戰，前後一共五次，展開了浴血的大決鬥。此次海上戰鬥情况如何悽愴，可由下面的數字知道。即我方的戰果是：大型魚雷艇一隻起火擱淺，小型魚雷艇二隻起火沉沒，一隻擱淺起火，一隻受傷起火（或已沉沒），共計六隻。而我方也有發動艇二艘沉沒，一艘擱淺，另有武裝艇一艘擱淺，餘下的一隻發動　也被創十一處，且有二人戰死。</p>
<p>但「海的陸軍部隊」的血戰並不止這些，這是後方的人應該知道的。「海的陸軍部隊」的惡戰苦鬥，其劇烈的程度將與日俱增。恐怕這樣悽慘劇烈的戰鬥將反復重演到殺盡美國兵時。（　川報道班員）（譯自五月十七日「朝日新聞」）</p>

<h3>淚</h3>
<p>— 桑神</p>
<p>曾幾何時我學會了憂鬱，一股悶悶地氣，老是緊塞在心頭，像一座壘石，一件鉛塊重甸甸地擠壓着，擠壓着，永遠推不開去……由此我認識了寂寞，認識了淚……那一顆顆潮潤的，氷冷的，永遠流不盡的。就這麽淌在我臉上的淚。但我忍着不敢有一些抽咽，淚到一個男子該是顯出多麽的羞恥和脆弱！可是賴它讓我發洩心頭的鬱憤，洶湧澎湃地如瀑布，如波濤，我驚奇我還有這末的力量呵！</p>
<p>斗室孤燈，夜闌枯坐，沈默的宇宙，沈默的我。這時的心境應該是甯靜的，但我給雜亂的思慮佔據着，起伏不已，坐立不安。行年未滿三十，却己嘗盡人間煩惱，這時聽妻兒們的均勻的呼息，看看他們酣適，天眞無邪的睡容，才是一點安慰。但安慰的后面—却隱藏着無限悽凉意味。在米珠薪桂的今日，薪給所入僅够維特幾頓薄粥而巳，再有什麽供給妻兒們貪望的享受的呢？思之不禁　然。</p>
<p>三年前大學畢業的時候，一位老敎授忠吿的訓詞又在我耳邊重嚮了：「你們的前程是遠大的，希毫你們每個如一匹雄健的駿馬，馳騁在廣闊的平原上，嘯傲奔放，過着理想的，也是得意的日子呵……」我們年靑的一羣，緊精會神的恭耹着，給他興奮的語調振作着，屛息着不敢喘一點氣，個個面前是一串串光耀的希望，臉上掛滿笑影。但是繼着老敎授又用沈鬱的口吻淡淡地說：「可是我警吿你們，第一件事，而且祇有一件事；千萬不要早結婚呵……唉，結婚是最損人志氣的了，那猶如一匹馬拖上了一部馬車，受了羅絆，减低了前進的速率—那你在人生道上就顯見得要落伍了…呵呵，那是最沒辦法的事呢？」老敎授呼了一口氣，那誠懇而衰老的態度至今我還不能忘掉，然而在當時我們都為為這是多餘的話，蛇足般的顧慮。因為我們面前懸着的是一堆堆光　的不切實的理想呀！</p>
<p>但我離開了學校，踏進社會，一度為失業的恐慌而奔走，繼着結了婚，繼着生了孩子……匆匆三年，我已是兩個孩子的父親了，四口之家，在物價瘋狂上漲之下，為生活掙扎的苦况。實難以形容的。而我為四個人肩起生活的重擔。更是嘗盡人間辛酸苦辣之味。我在日間工作之餘，還得夜間趕寫稿子，然終日為稻梁謀的結果，尙感入不敷出的苦况。現在以我例作拖車的馬，尙嫌形容不够，簡直是拖磨石的牛了。「為兒孫作馬牛」，我的感喟却並不因淪為牛馬般的勞苦而含怨，相反的，倒因即像牛馬樣的忙碌，而還不够贍養我的妻兒們，這點實是內心負疚的。在平日看到他們無邪的笑，呱呱的啼，天眞幼稚的小動作……這算是天倫間有趣而愉快的資料，但在靜處獨自想到這些，禁不住流淚了。做父親的責任該是什麽呢？怎未可以使他們更安逸一點的呢？這些沒有結果的問題化作無數的小毛蟲，噬吮我的心頭，於是我更飲泣着了！</p>
<p>漆黑之夜，有時突然從被衾中醒來，萬賴沉寂，祇覺得我的淚，滾滾如珠，溜滑在枕上簌簌作饗。我疑惑有這末多的眼淚呵；此時萬慮俱寂，感觸人世的孤伶伶地，於是我想到朋友，——你怎末沒有朋友的？</p>
<p>妻時時帶責問的口氣問我，但話的後面我早猜透，怪我拘謹的不會交幾個富貴的朋友，不肯鑽營，趨俗，近年來發財的機會易如反掌，而我固執的不願去投機，囤積，同時沒有兜得轉的朋友的輔助，以至到現在尙為一個寒酸的窮士。妻對我的奚落，我願默默地忍受着，她的直覺觀念旣已如此，如裝僅僅用空　去曉喻大義，也是徒然的，又想到她在日間為家務，兒輩親任操勞之苦，向我洩出牢騷的感慨，也是出於一種不得已的。可是我因此益覺得人生道上的伶仃，連同牀的人還做着異夢。何况更是陌路的人呢？於是我的淚，一顆顆，一滴滴，流着，流着……這時唯一的安慰者也是這淚珠了吧</p>
<p>短簡</p>
<h3>談做人</h3>
<p>— 胡生權</p>
<p>××，我　什麽話對你說是適當的呢？當我們處在差不多的境遇中，都不能够把心情沉靜下來的時候。我覺得向你來說明我自己，或是把信作為符咒，來醫治你的「苦悶」，都是多能的事。想想看，你撞進我的生活中來，似乎不能算一個短時期了，我敢大胆地武斷一句，你有許多習慣都是受了我的影嚮而養成的；如果我們為了這種事嘮嘮叨叨，不是太愚笨了麽？但是你離開我差不多有半年了，在這半年中，我第一次受到生活苦難的磨折，這磨折改變了我的思想和脾氣，常常使我無　地憤怒起來。尤其是接到你的來信，滿紙絕望的訴說使我感到不平！你那裏來這麽多的憎恨，這麽多的眼淚，這麽多的悲憫？你得想想我的情形呵，如果你並不願意想到更大更廣在世界各角落裏被難的一羣。</p>
<p>如果我的說話惹起你的反感，那麽，我得哭了！這世界上還有誰了解我一分一絲一毫？這是你所知道的，我活了二十多歲。在去年才　識了貧窮。起初，它的猙獰嚇得我沒有勇氣再在這崎嶇的人生道人掙扎下去，我把自已饗喻成一個碎船的落水者，在波浪洶涌的大海中，我憑什麽再能得到生命？後來，我把自己前途，寄托在另一種希望上，我抓到了一個救生圈。我綑束好了被憂患傷害了的心，從此，我不大想到自己了。我覺得，我該怪自己的糊塗：企圖乘了破船長風破浪？我彈掉淚水笑了：你知道我一些實際的情形，像你這樣善感的人，一完會可憐我的。我幾次在酒樓裏用手按着袋子，沒法付賬；你閉起眼想想，我是怎樣强笑着，怎樣同友人們支吾着，看着他們摸出了鈔票而我漲紅了臉……你知道我並不是一個頂吝嗇的人，為什麽我會變成這樣呢？這値得我深深地思慮，値得我的子孫深深也思慮。一句話：一個人只為自己打算，他總有一天要滅亡的，這世界上不容許你安分地獨善其身呵！</p>
<p>××，這句話我是同情的，一個沒有母親的人，他是水遠生活在沒有太陽的冬天裏。但是你為什麽要這樣仇視社會呢？你說你是淸水，總不能够和油垢混和起來。我覺得你還不够　極，你還不能科學地來把握現階段的社會問題，你為什麽不再進一步說：你是酒精，把油垢洗得乾亁净凈，這不是更勇敢，更有意義麽？</p>
<p>你現在居住在一個小鄕城裏，雖然離開了滿是弟妹的家而使你　念，但是以「小開」資格在店裏做事，生活大約還舒服吧。你還有何求呢？你理應滿足了，要知道沒有一個人的生活是美滿的，何况在這苦難的時代？這是你的毛病，也是我的毛病，沉耽於自己的理想而厭惡現實的環境，結果帶來了無窮數煩惱，這煩惱是無補於我們實際上缺陷的，反惹得我們情感非常脆弱，這是何苦來呢？現在我們應該切切實實地做人了，在生話苦難由訓練自己，堅强自己……</p>

<p>瞧！路不住在我脚下向後退讓，</p>
<p>我能不為歡忭而高唱</p>
<h3>木偶</h3>
<p>— 志明</p>
<p>這一個雕刻精細宛如天質一般的木偶站在我的書案上，牠正在儘量的向我瞧着，瞧着……，一動也不動地，目不轉瞬地瞧着……牠那圓圓的，雪白的臉蛋兒正在向我獻着微笑！那二個面頰上的始終不會平覆的笑渦也畢　地露現在我的面前，啊！牠的笑容是可掬的，牠的英姿是豐滿的，是美麗的，是可愛的，是……</p>
<p>牠更有金黃色的美髪，雪白的嫩臉，烏黑的限瞳，微紅的嘴唇，粉紅色的衣服，淡綠色的襪子，光亮的皮鞋……正是一位實足的新時代裏的小女性</p>
<p>牠在呆呆地瞧着我，而我也在發恍地瞧着牠，這四目相對，正像電流一般的互相交織着！啊！牠的品格，高尙的志向，敏捷的動作，深奧的思想：他是一個好靑年，好公民，好國民。除此以外，他還有一個長處，也是他的一個短處，那就是—自　。自謙果是一個靑年應有的長處，可是太自謙對於一個靑年也是一個短處。</p>
<p>「材，過分的自謙會引起友誼上的創傷的啊！」我常常這樣的對他說。</p>
<p>現在他已離開了道個世界！雖然他軀壳還依舊安逸地睡在這個世界的地底下，可是他的靈魂已和我們隔絕了！</p>
<p>三年了，我們不見已有整整的三年了！這生離死別令人回憶起了，是够使人痛苦的了！那麽旣然這麽的痛苦，還是忘了他罷，別再記着他罷！可是話雖這麽說，他的影兒還在不斷地在我的腦海裏浮現着，浮現着……</p>
<p>影評</p>
<h3>「刧後鴛鴦」</h3>
<p>— 古辛</p>
<p>……「燕靑與李師師」裏飾李師師的張靜，出於劇本底限制，沒有一展所長；「刼後鴛鴦」給了妙更多演戲的機會。陶英華是一個充滿悲劇性的女子，從富紳底外甥女淪落到賣淫婦，中間經過了好幾個階段，張靜底演技有着很好的成就。最成功的是內心表現，當英華走投無路，在橋頭頓萌短見時那種絕望與痛苦交迫的神情，正待跳入水中，猛地一個回念，導演再用幻化的音響描摹她底心聲，確能使人感動。</p>
<p>……飾英華底舅父的徐聽不及他在「血濺芙蓉」裏飾私土販首領成功。這兩個人物個性大不同，一個是陰險，一個則僅是昏庸的嚴厲。徐聰演本，最厲有餘，昏庸不足。浦克的人學生，在外形上嫌老一點。繼母太做作。還有一個不重要的胖女傭人，除了過火，看樣子倒頗會做戲。</p>
<p>……必須提出的是張奕。他在「燕靑與李師師」裏是男主角，這裏却飾一個卑鄙的無業游民，雖然短短幾個塲面，可是神態逼眞。張奕是更可以期望的，假若在優秀的導演底扶植下。</p>
<p>……故事的確不够接受過高的評價。結局硬凑成父子重圓，不但要不得，簡直破壞了全劇底情緒和統一。恁許多不幸事都會集到英華一人身上，也未免太偶然性。然而片段地講，它總算部份地反映了現實社會的一鱗半爪。這裏有人情私利，趁火打刼，有各行各門的惡勢力畢露，也有種種副人走向「下賤」的原因底提供。——雖然劇作者底刻劃顯然不够深遠。如果這部影片還値一看，這該是很重要的一點。音樂配合得很貼切。鏡頭不活潑。配音依舊糟！</p>

<h3>本報助學金　足球義賽今日舉行　僑聯邀將戰東華　社會各界一致熱烈贊助</h3>
<p>— 梅必賢</p>
<p>本報讀者助學金足籃球義賽經月餘之籌劃，由本報陳社長之各方接洽，目下均已就緒。足球賽即將於今日下午五時半，在黃陂路跑馬廳舉行。</p>
<p>各界熱烈贊助</p>
<p>今日義賽，請足聯會周家骐君任總指揮，沈回春襄助一切事務。更蒙沈嗣良潘三省譚敬同文瑞等等諸公及有關係各方面，均竭力贊助，得能順利進行。而社會各界士女又踴躍購券，熱烈參加。嘉惠淸寒子弟，本報表示無限感謝也。</p>
<p>名人開球給獎</p>
<p>今日對抗隊伍，為華人常勝軍東華隊迎戰義將變相之僑聯隊。後者更趁津聯尙未北返之機會，臨時邀四員大將助戰，實力增厚不少，預料必有一番驚天動地之搏殺。今戰門票為公共看台二百元。塲內榮譽券，則分二千元五千元一萬元三種。均由靜安寺路跑馬廳大門入塲。屆時並敎請林康侯氏行開球禮，滿映影星李香關小姐給獎。本報特備兩大銀盾贈與賽兩隊，以留紀念。今賽票款所入，將悉數充本報讀者助學金，涓滴歸公。所有開支，另由本報開支。故此義賽，預料球迷影迷溶於一塲，定必爭先恐後，將有空前盛况。蓋旣得欣賞至上球賽，復可一覩影星眞面目，且為助淸寒學子之舉，一舉而三得，豈有不樂往之理？</p>
<p>東華士氣正銳努力保持常勝</p>
<p>細察東華隊近况，頗覺其進攻有路，守衛有術，越戰越住妙。最近以三對〇克服津聯之役，更見精彩，全隊將士，無不在顚峯狀慫中。最値得一提者，老將戴麟經梁樹棠莊友仁三將，一度均現老態，近則非特漸見恢復，抑且有當年咤叱之氣槪。據記者所悉，該隊每星期有二次練習，有此現象，決非偶然。今戰仍以最佳陣容應戰，當有必勝之局面。唯行軍有示，不驕不懈，乃無失常之演出。况今日僑聯試新陣容，前後均有上將助戰，頗有使人捉摸不定之球路。觀其所公佈陣容，而究其用心，不外下列：敢獻鄙見於東華之前。</p>
<p>其守衛捨麥契蒂而起用津聯蔣竇等，蓋蔣氣力充沛，能阻李垚之活躍，及與孫錦順死纏，更能利用其餘暇，助左衛之不足，以夾住韓龍海之猛竄。前二戰中確有成功之處。故鄙意今日東華應知其然而覓破之之道，則云厥唯仍利用小韓猛竄。然小韓之竄，應注重在阻擋及掩護對方後衛，則阿戴錦順李垚，均可乘機建功矣。其中衛綫之調整，未見理想，最顯著者為用津將勃利尼之任左前衛，乃為遏止龍海幼良之進攻。然以幼良之功夫，小韓之奔馳，或不致中其毒也。致言其前鋒綫，閱名單而論其個人按術，則俱在水準以上。然其連絡若何，無從推測。要之左右兩針鮑桀及亞托馬利能呼前應後，為進攻之輸血管。而兩翼尙合理想，其以奧托尼洛之出主中帥，其目的必為牽制老鐔，或竟反來釘住老譚擬破壞東華中衛綫之球路，覓中央突破之第。故老鐔應知所敵計，不為所算，則彼必致徒勞心血也。一能如斯，東華而能保持常態，則常勝軍捷歌穩唱，有何懼哉？</p>
<p>僑聯趨將助陣人馬令人生畏</p>
<p>僑聯隊雖二度受屈於華隊，心有未甘。適値本報邀請參戰，又欣逢津聯留滬之良緣，乃邀津四義將加入，志在一勝，吐此積忿為快。今戰公佈之新陣容，尤以前綫之堅硬，令人生畏。中鋒奧托尼洛，本中堅上將，其脚頭爽脆，頭頂又見兇狠，今日必擬出放冷箭，邦綸應加注意。其左路二鋒在天津同隸一隊，聯絡有素，必能有佳妙演出，將予東華張林根莊友仁重大之威脅也。</p>
<p>總之，東華今戰未必能輕易取勝，必須經過一番血戰及戰略上用功夫。是則球賽之精彩，可以預卜。</p>
<h3>籃球三塲比賽　十二四六舉行</h3>
<p>籃球義賽，已接洽中靑對抗西靑，採三賽兩勝制。定本月十二·十四·十六·三天，下午七時半在八仙橋靑年會健身房舉行。按中靑集華聯藥仁餘汕隊三隊之精銳而成，巳由張溎祥余郇十盡力在訓練中。其演出水準，超越以往，可無異議。而西靑亦為巨人蒙諾克之混合軍，番將詭計多端，戰術新潁。故三塲龍虎鬥，必為本報助學金義賽增光不少，誠籃球季節後，唯一之好戲，亦球迷之眼福，間接亦淸寒學十之倖運也。</p>
<h3>津聯隊實力　守遠勝於攻　任務吿皆即將北返</h3>
<p>天津津聯隊來滬四戰，已於昨日戰滬西聯後，全部完畢。其第一戰和滬聯隊，本刋上期巳評述其經過，茲再評其後三戰，為送別津聯隊之文也。</p>
<p>第二戰　敗於東華</p>
<p>此戰津聯過常勝軍東華隊，內衛雖極力抵抗，卒被東華以小派司衝入腹地。下半時鐵腿之近門一射，台爾竇卡同亦無法抵抗。所以津聯此戰之失敗，在守的方面，可謂克盡厥職。至於攻的方面，所以未能攻破東華之門者，下列二原因。當是大部份人公認的事實：　津聯之鋒錢太散渙，進攻時二內鋒太落後，以致東華防守綫很少受到威脅。　津聯之人事調動太多，尤其在下半時，大部份時間都在預備員進出頻繁上調動，令人嘖嘖稱奇。因此，欲求純熟鋒利的攻勢，自然難矣。</p>
<p>至此戰津聯所失之三球，第一球係風伯助東華而奪得頭陣，增長士氣不少。第二球阿戴之一撥及第三球老孫之近門急射，都是無可救藥的，津聯此戰，有守無攻，不敗幾希</p>
<p>第三戰　初勝聯誼</p>
<p>此役津聯在下半時，利用聯誼之長力不濟，由勃利尼及勃泰梯尼各建一功，遂得初告勝利。但另一方面，聯誼之球運奇劣，再加台爾竇卡之高接抵擋，津聯之得略紥回面子，端在聯誼之敗於該隊論者謂，設聯誼不退出聯饗及平常多練習，津聯恐未必能勝。</p>
<p>至於萊盤別斯的下半時出現，使津聯的攻勢轉盛，如仍依前二塲的調動前鋒辦法，至多祗能打成和局而已。所以津聯在不調人及對方無長力二原則下，稍慰將士勇氣和精神，能用戰術之勝利也。</p>
<p>第四戰　再和西聯</p>
<p>昨日臨去秋波戰西聯一塲，雙方皆平心靜氣，球塲空氣亦殊鬆懈。結果津聯賴A柯拉沙之犯規，由亞托馬利罰中十二碼球，遂與西聯再以各一言和。此戰津聯之攻勢仍不及西聯為盛。所以未敗者，在西聯之少默契及不以理想之陣綫出塲，故雙方客來客去，殊無足觀。</p>
<p>綜觀津聯隊之實力，守優於攻，可在四塲中明白見到。此次前鋒靈魂喬享生未來，攻勢自然大打折扣。其最令人留有深刻印象者，為守門及內衛之防綫耳。</p>
<p>津聯隊即將於明後日北返，此行尙屬不虛。勝聯誼而敗於東華，和滬聯及西聯，平均之至。此行去矣，願他日再來，在戰術上有長足之進步，以　此間球迷，有深切之殷望焉。</p>

<h3>Urgent Notification from the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, Business Letter No. 10</h3>
<p>Regarding a notification: The Ministry, in order to closely supervise the business operations of private enterprises and companies, guide the use of funds towards increased production, maintain the foundation of companies, and align with wartime economic policies, previously formulated the "Provisional Measures for Supervising Private Enterprises and Companies," which were promulgated and implemented on February 11 of this year. The measures and related forms were sent to various enterprises and similar companies in different locations for their information. Now that more than three months have passed, many companies have complied with Articles 2 and 3 of the said measures, filling out and submitting reports on business conditions, balance sheets, and income statements to the Ministry. However, a significant number have not yet complied. According to the regulations, punishment should be imposed, but considering this is the first instance, there may be unfamiliarity with the procedures, and delays may be unavoidable due to distance. Therefore, a grace period is granted. All enterprises and companies in various locations are required to submit all required forms for the period before April of this year, fully completed, to the Ministry by June 15. Hereafter, monthly reports should be filled out and submitted in accordance with the regulations and deadlines. If there are further delays, registration will be revoked according to the regulations. This notice is published to inform all relevant enterprises and companies to handle the matter carefully and avoid delays, lest they incur regret. Absolutely. This is a special notification. Minister Chen Jun, June 2, Republic of China Year 33.</p>

<p>June 6, Republic of China Year 33, Chairman Yuan Lvdeng.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Implementing Streamlining of Government</h3>
<p>Recently, central politics has shown a trend of gradual improvement. Simultaneously, responsible officials in various ministries are also making efforts in their respective areas. We consistently advocate political reform and hope for political enlightenment, and we are very pleased with this trend of improvement. However, in terms of the overall goal of political enlightenment, some trends of improvement are merely the beginning of the road to enlightenment. To reach the final destination of enlightenment naturally requires continuous effort. We believe that the most important issues currently, such as security, production, and education, all require the use of political power to overcome difficulties. To overcome these difficult problems, the authorities must possess the greatest determination and thorough reform is essential. Some trends of improvement are not enough and are still insufficient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the trend of gradual improvement in central politics can exert leadership and influence on local politics. At the same time, it can also increase confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is an achievement in the spiritual aspect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the material aspect is equally important and cannot be neglected. To give an example, all those who serve in government agencies are public servants, and their treatment should be as equal as possible. For instance, the difference in treatment between employees of the national bank and employees of administrative agencies such as the Supervisory, Examination, Education, and Judicial Yuan is clearly unfair. We have always believed that public servants' salaries must be sufficient to provide for their basic needs and to raise families. In this way, all political malpractices and loopholes can be reduced invisibly. If the central authorities are aware that public servants' salaries are low and their lives are difficult but do not seek fundamental solutions and fail to strictly correct illegal acts of corruption, it is tantamount to condoning them. In this way, political reform will be nearly impossible, and some trends of improvement cannot be sustained, and may only be a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>We have previously proposed the two points of streamlining troops and simplifying government. At a time when the issue of security is of great importance and when central politics is gradually improving, the streamlining of troops and simplifying government are even more urgently needed. Because failing to streamline troops can disrupt security and failing to simplify government can prevent politics from getting on the right track. This is a political experience of recent years and an undeniable fact. And simplifying government is a necessary path to material improvement in politics. Because overlapping and redundant agencies can only restrain each other, delay time, and are fundamentally inefficient. On the other hand, the establishment of redundant agencies increases idle and redundant personnel and consumes funds. In reality, redundant agencies are not necessary for administration, and the funds they consume take away from the funds of other necessary agencies. At the same time, the salaries paid to redundant personnel take away from the salaries of other necessary civil servants. Because of the existence of redundant agencies and idle personnel, the funds of necessary agencies and the salaries of necessary civil servants are reduced, which is the main reason for the decline in administrative efficiency, and therefore the reason why simplifying government is necessary.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the total number of civil servants reaches more than 25,000 (excluding the First District Public Office and the Security Office). Given the current price index, whether the city government's income is sufficient to ensure a stable life for this large number of civil servants and their families is questionable. Therefore, we advocate that the merger of agencies under the municipal government and the dismissal of redundant personnel require review and adjustment. If the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government can work together, at least the number of personnel handling general affairs in each bureau and department can be reduced. This is one example. Secondly, there is considerable overlap in the organization between the First District Public Office and the municipal government, and it is necessary to merge them as soon as possible. The funds saved from the layoffs can be used to increase the salaries of necessary civil servants to improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<h3>National Government Declaration of War</h3>
<p>On December 8 two years ago, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with allied Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still used their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and even intensified it, going so far as to collude with the Chongqing faction to join the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, their violence has been gradually defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of allied Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been lost, and their cunning schemes have increased. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas ruled by the National Government, and incite the Chongqing faction to continuously harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even use their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willingly driven by Britain and the United States and serving as rebels in East Asia, is despicable. Britain and the United States, harboring malicious intentions towards East Asia, are doing their utmost to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation. This is what the East Asian nations should jointly resist. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with allied Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchuria and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same aspirations for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years, repeatedly winning glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War, and should echo them to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of peace and goodwill for the entire world are all closely related to this. Let us be of one mind and wholeheartedly strive to carry out this great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Biak Island, Destroying Two Transport Ships, Major Fire Also Breaks Out in Enemy Coastal Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The battle to seize Biak Island is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese air force, in cooperation with the army, has been highly active in recent days, attacking enemy ships and enemy positions, with great results. On the afternoon of the 2nd, two enemy transport ships were destroyed off the coast of the island. One was a medium-sized ship, and the attack caused fires at two of their landing facilities. Two B-25 aircraft that came to challenge the Japanese were also shot down. One Japanese aircraft did not return. On the night of the 6th, Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy positions on the coast of the island, causing a major fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – An enemy force of about one division, equipped with tanks and artillery, landed near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea on May 16. The Japanese forces in the area launched repeated attacks on them from May 27 to June 2, eventually forcing part of the enemy force to retreat to Wakde Island, which is located off the coast. At the same time, the Japanese forces annihilated the main force along the coast and destroyed their heavy artillery positions. The Japanese forces are currently sweeping up the remaining enemy forces in the dense forests near the area. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle include the elimination of no fewer than 1,000 enemy soldiers. If the wounded are included, the enemy's losses will exceed 3,000. In addition, Japanese aircraft also launched attacks on enemy airfields in the area. On the night of the 5th, Wakde Island was bombed. The results of this bombing are unknown because it was carried out at night, but it certainly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. A major fire broke out at the bombed location and lasted for two hours, which could be seen from the coast. Since the bombing, the Wakde Island airfield seems to have lost its function because no enemy aircraft have been seen taking off from the airfield.</p>
<p>Rabaul, 8th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of May 30, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft on patrol near Rabaul discovered an enemy torpedo boat. The aircraft immediately attacked and sank it. At the same time, it also shot down two enemy fighters.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 7th the results of the air battles in May as follows: The total number of enemy aircraft that attacked in various theaters in May was 32,764, which is about one and a half times the number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April (24,097). This number is the highest since the start of the war, while the Japanese side's losses in May were less than those in April (175 aircraft in April, 111 in May). These figures prove the superiority of the Japanese air force's performance. The progress of the battles in various theaters is as follows:</p>
<p>South Pacific: The number of enemy aircraft that attacked New Guinea totaled 10,067. Since May, when the enemy landed at the mouth of the Tor River and on Biak Island in New Guinea, the enemy air force has heavily bombed the landing sites. Therefore, the Japanese garrison forces fought against a numerically superior enemy, and their achievements were thus magnified. Enemy aircraft continued to attack the Bismarck Archipelago, such as Bougainville Island. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the Bougainville area was much higher than in April. The fundamental reason for this is that the Japanese garrison on the island formed a highly effective defensive zone on the enemy's path of advance, so the enemy could not attack with ground forces. Therefore, the enemy repeatedly attacked with a superior air force to suppress the Japanese forces' defensive zone. The situation of enemy aircraft attacking the Banda Sea was roughly the same as in April. In the entire South Pacific region, 228 enemy aircraft were shot down and 160 were destroyed, for a total of 388.</p>
<p>Central Pacific: Compared to April, fewer enemy aircraft attacked in May, but there were still continuous air raids every day. The results included 113 enemy aircraft shot down and 48 destroyed, for a total of 161.</p>
<p>Burma: The number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April was 7,364, which increased to 10,686 in May. Because the enemy's paratroopers attacking Imphal and the ground forces attacking the Fugong area were in an unfavorable situation, the air force was increasingly strengthened, showering the Japanese front line with bombs and repeatedly attacking the Japanese rear supply lines. As a result, the air counterattack also became more intense. Compared to the 140 aircraft shot down in April, the number increased sharply in May, with 107 shot down and 90 destroyed, for a total of 197.</p>
<p>China: The number of enemy aircraft sorties in May doubled compared to April. The reason for this was the Japanese army's Henan operation and new operations in Central China, which caused the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to continuously create disturbances. In addition to inflicting heavy damage on them, the Japanese air force also launched attacks on enemy air force bases, shooting down 45 enemy aircraft and destroying 115, for a total of 160, achieving great results.</p>
<p>North Pacific: There was no change in the total number of enemy aircraft that attacked. The enemy's attempts in this area have not been successful.</p>
<h3>Japanese Intelligence Officer Yokoyama Discusses the Invasion of Europe, Believes the German Army Will Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Yokoyama, an intelligence officer from the 3rd Department of the Japanese Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, told the Sino-Manchurian press corps on the 7th: "We are not very concerned about this anti-Axis invasion of Europe. The German army has anticipated this battle since the start of the war in 1939 and has made thorough preparations. This battle is a critical moment in determining the enemy's survival, so it is predicted that they will convert a large amount of their resources into combat power and implement a total mobilization of personnel to make a final struggle. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how long the invasion will continue, but in the current process, although the German people are facing a major crisis, they have been able to overcome them one by one resolutely. With their nation's glorious traditional spirit as their background, and with modern science and unparalleled excellent troops, they are fighting desperately, so the final victory will belong to Germany in the future. The German people are equally concerned about the security of Europe and the security of their own country. Protecting Europe is protecting their own country. With this firm belief, they will surely overwhelm Britain and the United States. Conversely, the enemy is using the ambition to invade and occupy territory to extend its power. This cannot be compared with Germany's spirit of certain victory. The European War and the Greater East Asia War have different names, but in a word, these two operations are the common operations of Japan and Germany. Therefore, from Japan's perspective, the current invasion operation must be given the greatest attention. The German army will seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, under a clever operational plan, will thoroughly annihilate the stubborn enemy. Not only the Japanese people are sincerely praying for this, but it is certain that all East Asian nations are doing the same."</p>
<p>Ambassador Horikiri's Speech</p>
<p>Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Former Ambassador to Italy Horikiri gave a speech here as follows: "The long-publicized invasion of Europe has finally begun on the European continent. The German army has completely fortified the area and is waiting for the enemy to land, and it is expected that they will crush the enemy's landing attempts. Moreover, due to the withdrawal of the Eastern Front, the front line has been shortened, and with the shortening of the Italian front, it will be easier to exert its flexibility in the future. Although I dare not predict how it will evolve in the future, the German army has absolute confidence that it will repeat the tragedy of Zheng Chenggong. I would like to pray here for the German army's soldiers on behalf of our allied nations."</p>

<h3>Rice Profiteers Attempt to Exploit; Citizens Encouraged to Report; Japanese Embassy Authorities Express Cooperation</h3>
<p>Recently, the food supply in Shanghai has been disrupted, leading to soaring prices, which has significantly impacted people's livelihoods. Thanks to the active efforts of the municipal authorities, rice prices have gradually stabilized. However, a small number of unscrupulous merchants and malicious individuals are attempting to profit excessively, daring to raise prices again or bully rice vendors, extorting them along the way, which is deeply regrettable. All parties are paying close attention to this. The municipal government has ordered its subordinates to conduct thorough investigations. Mayor Chen and Minister of Industry Chen Jun delivered separate speeches yesterday (the 8th), urging citizens to assist the authorities by reporting any time they see evidence of disrupting the grain policy or manipulating prices to stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the Japanese Embassy authorities also expressed their willingness to cooperate. The speeches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Recently, the food supply in Shanghai has been disrupted, leading to soaring prices, which has significantly impacted people's livelihoods. The central government is deeply concerned and has ordered the Rice Control Committee and local governments to encourage procurement and improve the supply. Rice prices have gradually stabilized in recent days. However, it has been reported that a small number of unscrupulous merchants and malicious individuals are disregarding regulations, attempting to profit excessively, daring to raise prices again or bully rice vendors, extorting them along the way, which is deeply regrettable. The municipal government and military police authorities have been ordered to investigate and crack down on these activities within their respective jurisdictions. According to the Second Police Bureau, seven or eight suspects have been arrested in the past few days and are under intensive interrogation. The First Police Bureau has also obtained leads and is continuing its investigation. This shows that the rice market is still being manipulated. These criminals must be severely punished to deter others and ensure food security. I sincerely hope that the citizens of this city will assist the authorities by actively reporting such activities so that criminals have nowhere to hide, and rice prices can be stabilized. I have great expectations for this.</p>
<p>Minister Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Regarding improving the supply and ensuring sufficient food for the citizens of Shanghai, various concrete measures are being actively promoted by the relevant authorities. The food supply will improve in the future. However, according to various reports, there are malicious individuals disrupting the transportation and sale of rice. If these criminals are not punished, the future of the grain policy will be fraught with difficulties, and the harm to the people's food supply will be extreme. The municipal government has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting hoarding, manipulating prices, extorting money, adulterating rice, spreading rumors, and disrupting the grain policy to prevent others from imitating. Now, we are strictly enforcing these prohibitions to warn those who are stubborn. The general public should consider their own interests, assist the authorities, and report such activities at any time. I believe that with the cooperation of the government and the people, the current food problem can be solved smoothly.</p>
<h3>Speech by the Japanese Embassy Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai authorities, in light of the soaring rice prices at the beginning of this month, are exerting all their efforts to find countermeasures to stabilize the food supply for the people. At the same time, they are investigating and cracking down on the underground activities of unscrupulous individuals hoarding for excessive profits. The municipal government authorities have arrested and investigated several people suspected of manipulating rice prices and have stated that once it is determined that there are illegal activities, they will be severely punished and will continue to conduct thorough investigations. Mayor Chen's speech and the Ministry of Industry's speech to the same effect are well-known today. The Japanese authorities express their full agreement with the resolute actions of the Chinese officials, believing that cracking down on such illegal activities is crucial to the success or failure of food policy. Therefore, we are determined to assist to the end. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese people and other related parties must be sincere and must not engage in hoarding for excessive profits, which would worsen the food problem and lead to punishment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Yano Visits German Consul General</h3>
<p>The Allied forces suddenly invaded the west coast of France on the 6th, and after the German forces bravely counterattacked, they are now about to be annihilated. Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yano, visited German Consul General Fischer at the German Consulate in Shanghai at 2 PM on the 8th to express his respect for the German forces' powerful and courageous counterattack against the enemy. He also presented a congratulatory letter, wishing the German forces a final victory. At the same time, Consul General Fischer explained the strong German defenses in Europe and expressed his gratitude for Consul General Yano's congratulations.</p>
<h3>Vagrant Labor Camp Hosts Business and Industrial Leaders</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Social Welfare and the municipal government authorities, recognizing that the number of vagrants, beggars, and gangsters in Shanghai is the highest in the country, which not only affects the city's appearance but also poses a significant threat to public security, have established a vagrant labor camp to accommodate large numbers of people, provide education and work. The camp is seeking cooperation between officials and the people, creating a model that is easy to follow. A board of directors has been jointly organized, and the board members have been appointed. The camp will hold a tea party at the Industry and Commerce Association this afternoon (the 9th) to invite representatives from the city's business and industrial sectors in order to actively prepare for operations.</p>
<h3>Today is the Sixth Air Defense Day; Various Training Exercises to be Conducted; Air Raid Lighting Drills Tonight</h3>
<p>Today (the 9th) is the Sixth Air Defense Day. According to the person in charge of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, "Since the implementation of 'Air Defense Day,' half a year has passed. We are gratified by the deep concern of the citizens and the daily progress in air defense technology. The air defense training held at the end of last month under the guidance of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters provided an excellent opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the past six months of training. The Headquarters sincerely hopes to review the results of these two days with the citizens, further improve and strive forward. This is what we hope for." The points to note for the Sixth Air Defense Day are listed below:</p>
<p>Lighting Control</p>
<p>The last training had the worst record in history. Tomorrow (June 9th), on the Sixth Air Defense Day, we must pay close attention to lighting control and implement it carefully according to the following points. We hope that the citizens will pay special attention and that the Baojia heads, police, and community groups will provide sincere guidance on the various changes in controls. (A) Time: From dusk to 9:00 PM, the current standard lighting control. From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, a one-hour air raid lighting drill. From 10:00 PM to 10:30 PM, a half-hour air raid lighting drill. After 10:30 PM, return to standard lighting control. (B) Sirens will not be sounded this time. Each air defense group will ring bells or gongs at the above times and shout loudly. (C) Special attention must be paid to skylights, dormer windows, and tall buildings. (D) Street lights will be turned on during the alert warning, but only for this Air Defense Day (they must still be turned off after the surprise attack alarm). (E) Lights that are to be kept on must be turned off during the surprise attack alarm drill but remain on during the alert warning drill.</p>
<p>General Training</p>
<p>Various individual training exercises are the basis for comprehensive training. The proper use of anti-high-altitude water spraying methods and triangular bandages must be practiced correctly.</p>
<p>Communication and Liaison</p>
<p>The results of the last training were very poor. During air defense, it is often impossible to achieve effective results by relying on the activities of only a small number of air defense groups. Therefore, mutual communication between neighboring air defense groups and communication with military and government agencies must be carried out swiftly. This is extremely important, and we hope you will pay close attention. The locations and city phone numbers of relevant military and government agencies must be memorized and not forgotten, and more trained liaison personnel should be prepared to respond when telephones cannot be used. Even if communication and liaison are repeated many times, they are not considered too frequent.</p>
<p>First Aid Training</p>
<p>Hemostasis must be practiced sufficiently. Every drop of blood in the human body is related to life. If one relies on superficial training, it will be difficult to save lives in dangerous situations. Therefore, each air defense group must be familiar with hemostasis and emergency measures. Stretchers are few in number and should only be used for seriously injured people. Lightly injured people should be made to walk or be transported by rickshaw. In general, injuries to the head, chest, and abdomen can be considered serious injuries. Although backups are always insufficient, they must be used in case of fractures. Finally, we would like to state that the inspection of air defense equipment such as ladders and stretchers, despite repeated requests from the Headquarters, has not been taken seriously by the public, which is regrettable. It should be noted that this equipment is of great help in preventing and responding to crises, and we urge citizens to conduct a thorough inspection before and after training.</p>
<p>Today is the city's Sixth Air Defense Day. The Air Defense Command of the Second Police Bureau has decided to conduct fire extinguishing, bomb disposal, and first aid training exercises in each district to promote a general understanding of air defense among the citizens of the districts. At the same time, traffic and lighting will also be strictly controlled.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Zhou and Industry Minister Chen Discuss Control Policies</h3>
<p>Strengthening control agencies, smoothing the flow of goods, adjusting rice prices, and stabilizing food supplies are issues that are closely watched by officials and the public alike. The National Government and relevant authorities are actively consulting on adjustments and solutions. Minister of Industry Chen came to Shanghai a few days ago and has been closely consulting with relevant parties for several days. It is now known that Finance Minister Zhou Fohai, who is also the Director of the Materials Control Review Committee, also came to Shanghai a few days ago and is discussing ways to strengthen measures with leaders from Shanghai's economic and industrial circles on the above issues. It is reported that Ministers Zhou and Chen will meet with Supreme Economic Advisor Ogura in the near future to discuss the entire policy of adjusting materials control.</p>

It is also learned that the internal reorganization of the bank is nearing completion and that it is expected to resume operations soon.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Today's Football Game</h3>
<p>The seventh session of the Student Aid Fund of this newspaper has already begun. Given the current price situation, it is estimated that this session will require a larger amount of aid, and the goal is set at ten million yuan. We are appealing to all sectors to donate and are holding a charity football game today at 5:30 PM at the racecourse football field. We are very grateful to the Tung Wah and Overseas Chinese United football teams for their enthusiastic participation in the game, the Shanghai Football Association, the Shanghai Sports Association, and other relevant parties for their full support, and the racecourse for providing the venue, as well as to the gentlemen who generously donated by purchasing honorary tickets.</p>
<p>Secondly, we extend our most common and equally grateful thanks to all the spectators who will be attending today. With your fervent enthusiasm, hundreds of poor students will have the opportunity to continue their studies, indirectly cultivating talents for the country and society. We believe that if you can think from this perspective, you will surely feel at ease. However, today we would like to especially request that you absolutely maintain order at the entrance and avoid the chaotic situations of past football games. You may be enthusiastically rushing to be the first, but after the order is disrupted, accidents are unavoidable. If this causes material damage to the venue, the compensation will reduce the income of the student aid fund, which we believe is definitely not what you want. Therefore, we sincerely propose:</p>
<p>We request that all spectators maintain order at the entrance.</p>

<h3>The Battle of Supplies at Torokina</h3>
<p>The ship soldiers, marking a new era in the 70-year history of the military, have been active in the bloody battles on the front lines of the South Seas since the beginning of last year. In order to annihilate the enemy forces at Torokina, they conducted supply operations through naval maneuvers under the barrage of enemy aircraft and attacks by torpedo boats, transporting large cannons, ammunition, and food to the front lines. The arduous struggles and valiant efforts of the "Army of the Sea," the ship soldiers, are truly beyond description. The following is the "Triumphal Song of the Sea," written in blood by the elite of the "Army of the Sea" amidst the raging waves of the South Seas.</p>
<p>Encounter Battle on the Return Journey</p>
<p>Two motorized boats and one armed small motorized boat, with Second Lieutenant Ōuchi as the commander of the boat squadron, were heading straight for Cape Mopinā. There was no bright moon in the sky, only twinkling stars, and the sea of Java Bay was calm. The fifty nautical miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇 and the further fifteen nautical miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇 had been navigated safely, and the transport mission had been completed. Now, they were hurrying back to base, but they still could not relax their heavy sense of tension.</p>
<p>The sound of the engines echoed on the waves, clear though faint, hindering the work of those listening for enemy ships and aircraft. At this time, the boat squadron composed of three motorized boats had slowly entered the waters frequented by enemy torpedo boats.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two long blasts of the whistle sounded. This was the alarm whistle indicating the appearance of torpedo boats. Sergeant Major Ōtsuka, the commander of the armed boat, had spotted enemy silhouettes about 600 meters ahead at 40 degrees to the right. One, two, three... there were a total of five torpedo boats, rushing towards them, so that even in the darkness, the white waves churned up by their bows could be seen clearly. How could they let this go? Charge forward, launching a preemptive strike against the enemy torpedo boats!</p>
<p>"Prepare for battle—blast!" Sergeant Major Ōtsuka's boat immediately made a sharp turn to the right. Petty Officer Hirano quietly fixed his gaze on the enemy's second boat. Charge, and charge again. "Fire!" With a command, the rapid-fire artillery shells streaked with red tails, directly assaulting the enemy's second boat. The kill-or-be-killed tactic of closing to within 300 meters proved effective. The first shell hit the hull of the enemy's second boat, causing flames to erupt, illuminating the sea. At this moment, the enemy's fourth boat emerged from the flames and smoke at full speed, foolishly seeking revenge for its comrade, spitting out a series of tracer bullets. On this side, Private First Class Fuchigami, the machine gunner on the boat, suddenly fell, hit by a bullet. "Let me do it!" Sergeant Takahashi grabbed the gun handle that Fuchigami was still holding. Rat-tat-tat, the bullets rained down, targeting the enemy's fourth boat.</p>
<p>Under our side's desperate preemptive strike, the enemy boats were completely subdued. The enemy's fourth boat, attempting a counterattack, was also hit by a single shot from Private First Class Nomura, who replaced the wounded Petty Officer Hirano, and sank 150 meters ahead.</p>
<p>Desperate Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>Having already sunk two enemy torpedo boats, the morale of Ōtsuka's boat was even higher. A glance revealed that one of the motorized boats, commanded by Second Lieutenant Ōuchi, had entrusted the battle to the armed boat and was speeding back to base. The armed boat could now complete its original mission without regret, launching a brave and fearless battle. On its right, there seemed to be an enemy command boat; on its left, the enemy's third boat charged straight at them through the intense gunfire. Boom, Ōtsuka's boat rocked violently. One, two, three shells opened two large holes in the stern on the right side and one large hole in the bow on the left side. Seawater gurgled in. But the "Army of the Sea" would not be intimidated by flooding. The crew members tried to stop the water from entering while pressing towards the enemy's fifth boat. At the critical moment, when the two boats were only fifteen meters apart, Boat Commander Ōtsuka's pistol suddenly roared, and the entire crew, like a piece of hot iron, prepared to jump onto the enemy's torpedo boat. Seeing this menacing stance, the enemy's fifth boat quickly turned around and fled. The remaining command boat and the third boat also could not withstand Ōtsuka's boat's frenzied assault, laying down a barrage of bullets and fleeing across the sea.</p>
<p>In the five-minute battle from 6:50 p.m. to 6:55 p.m., two enemy torpedo boats were sunk, but Ōtsuka's boat was also hit by three artillery shells and eight machine gun bullets. The incoming water increased rapidly, and Boat Commander Ōtsuka had no choice but to order "grounding and landing." Although the brave men on the boat were covered in blood, all the guns were intact. Eager to avenge themselves in the battle to come, Boat Commander Ōtsuka declared that they would unload all the guns onto the shore no matter what.</p>
<p>Just then, a rumble of enemy aircraft was heard overhead. Two flares were dropped, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day. In the inescapable brightness, Ōtsuka's boat was clearly visible on the sea. Then three bombs fell in succession. But fortunately, all three bombs landed in the water, merely creating three splashes. All the crew members cheered "Banzai!" Soon, all the guns were safely unloaded onto the shore.</p>
<p>A Record of the Midnight Bloodbath</p>
<p>The tragic battle of the "Army of the Sea" did not end there. Less than a week later, on February 25th, the unrepentant enemy again used fifteen or more torpedo boats and five or more aircraft to patrol the dark seas, intending to cut off the Japanese army's supply line. The battle that day began at 5:00 p.m. in Gazelle Bay.</p>
<p>Four motorized boats and one armed small motorized boat, with Second Lieutenant Kitasawa of the Kondō squad as the commander of the boat squadron, waited until dusk to depart secretly from the boat hideout at 〇〇 to 〇〇 in order to deliver supplies to 〇〇. On the armed boat were Sergeant Major Takeo Tomi, a seasoned veteran, and Boat Squadron Leader Second Lieutenant Kitauki, their eyes wide open, carefully watching. Behind them were Sergeant Nishizaki's Nishizaki boat, Sergeant Miyake's Miyake boat, Sergeant Nishi's Nishi boat, and Sergeant Nishi's Nishi boat. These ten brave men, full of spirit, began to sail under the command of the boat squadron leader.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, shortly after departure, the engine of the Hotta boat suddenly malfunctioned. The Nishizaki boat immediately dropped a tow rope and began towing it while desperately trying to repair it. At this time, two enemy torpedo boats broke through the waves from afar and came to attack. "Damn it, reckless fools!" Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa gritted his teeth and ordered the opening of fire. After about ten minutes of combat, the enemy boats retreated across the sea. But at 7:20 p.m., the enemy began a second attack. Two enemy torpedo boats challenged the armed small motorized boat, which was at this time towing the Hotta boat towards 〇〇. The armed boat quickly untied the tow rope and assumed a fighting stance. Believing that a preemptive strike was the key to victory, the "Army of the Sea" spat out fierce gunfire from the bow, engaging the enemy torpedo boats in close combat. Intimidated by this daring charge, the enemy boats had no intention of engaging and began to flee into the open sea, but a machine gun bullet accidentally hit the hull of the armed boat. Although the crew members worked hard to repair it in preparation for the next battle, the constant influx of seawater eventually rendered the engine inoperable. The entire crew had no choice but to jump naked into the sea, carrying the armed boat and swimming towards the shore. Relying on the infamous power of the waves, which could rise to more than three meters high, the armed boat ran aground. Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa was forced to leave the armed boat and the Hotta boat there, leading the remaining three boats hurriedly towards 〇〇. Arriving at the destination, they saw that 〇〇 was burning fiercely under enemy fire, and with the raging waves surging, it was difficult to unload and land for a while.</p>
<p>Attack from Sea and Air</p>
<p>Turning the boats around, they unexpectedly encountered two enemy torpedo boats heading towards them, opening fire. Even more unfavorable, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber from the enemy forces was circling in the sky near the mouth of the 〇〇 River. Boat Squadron Leader Kitauki remained calm and arranged everything under the flare, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Under the light of the flares, as bright as day, they saw clearly that several torpedo boats were blocking their path. At this time, the Consolidated Liberator bomber began to drop bombs and strafe with machine guns. "Alright, shoot it down!" The first shot in the anti-aircraft battle was fired instantly. At the same time, they charged towards the three torpedo boats on the far right. The sea "bayonet charge" placed emphasis on the enemy's first boat. The intense concentrated fire did indeed destroy the first boat. Then they changed direction to attack the second boat, which immediately met the same fate as the first. The enemy's third boat, seeing this bold, self-sacrificing tactic, was frightened and quickly fled. But there was no time to breathe a sigh of relief, as two more large torpedo boats appeared. Under a desperate attack, one of them was immediately set on fire. However, the enemy's fighting spirit was also strong, especially with the assistance of the aircraft, their gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. On the friendly number one boat, Sergeant Nishizaki's face and left thigh were wounded and covered in blood, but he continued to fight without retreating. On the number three boat, Private First Class Nishizawa and Privates First Class Shimada and Eguchi were also wounded. And Private First Class Fukada, fighting in the bloodbath, finally let out a cry and fell beside the gun.</p>
<p>After finally repelling the remaining large torpedo boats, three more torpedo boats blocked their path. What should they do? They neither fired artillery nor guns, they were simply silent. How strange, what were their intentions? Amidst the heavy clouds of suspicion, our boat squadron continued to advance regardless. The gloomy silence did not last long. Enemy aircraft arrived! At the same time, the enemy torpedo boat group opened fire.</p>
<p>At this time, misfortune befell our boat squadron. The artillery shells had been used up, and they had no choice but to respond with machine guns. Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa continued to fire fiercely, engaging the enemy boats in close combat. The once-boiling fighting spirit would not be extinguished until the enemy forces were annihilated.</p>
<p>Mutual Damage</p>
<p>Such a difficult battle at sea continued from 11:30 p.m. on the 25th until 1:00 a.m. The fleeing enemy returned to challenge them again at 2:00 a.m. and 3:20 a.m. at dawn, engaging in a bloody showdown a total of five times. How tragic the situation of this naval battle was can be known from the following numbers. That is, our side's battle results were: one large torpedo boat caught fire and ran aground, two small torpedo boats caught fire and sank, one ran aground and caught fire, and one was damaged and caught fire (or had already sunk), for a total of six. On our side, two motorized boats sank, one ran aground, and another armed boat ran aground, and the remaining one motorized boat was damaged in eleven places, and two people were killed in action.</p>
<p>But the bloody battle of the "Army of the Sea" does not end there, this is what the people in the rear should know. The fierce struggles of the "Army of the Sea" will only intensify. It is feared that such tragic and intense battles will be repeated until all the American soldiers are killed. (Reporter from the 〇〇 News Team) (Translated from the May 17th "Asahi Shimbun")</p>

<h3>Map of the Situation on the Western Coast of France Map Explanation</h3>
<p>The anti-Axis forces launched a European landing operation on the 6th of this month. The landing site was in the Normandy region of northwestern France. According to Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons, more than four thousand ships were used in this landing operation, with the first line consisting of 11,000 aircraft. In addition to fiercely bombing the Atlantic Fortress, the enemy also dispatched parachute troops. However, the German defense was exceptionally solid, and the anti-Axis forces were repelled everywhere except for establishing a bridgehead in the Calais area. Most of the paratroopers were also annihilated. The enemy is planning to send reinforcements to continue the attack. Below is a map of the situation in western France.</p>
<p>White Reed</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Sang Shen</p>
<p>I don't know since when, I learned to be melancholic. A sullen air, always tightly blocked in my heart, like a stone fortress, a heavy lead block pressing down, pressing down, never able to push it away... From this, I came to know loneliness, came to know tears... Those moist, cold, and never-ending tears. Just like that, flowing on my face. But I endure and dare not sob at all. How shameful and fragile it would seem for a man to shed tears! But I rely on them to vent the depression in my heart, surging like a waterfall, like waves. I am surprised that I still have so much strength!</p>
<p>A lonely lamp in a small room, sitting withered late at night, a silent universe, a silent me. At this time, the state of mind should be tranquil, but I am occupied by chaotic thoughts, rising and falling, restless. Not yet thirty, but I have already tasted all the troubles of the world. At this time, listening to the even breaths of my wife and children, looking at their comfortable, innocent sleeping faces, is the only bit of comfort. But behind the comfort—hides an infinite sense of desolation. In today's world of precious rice and expensive firewood, the salary income is only enough to maintain a few thin bowls of porridge, and what else can be provided to my wife and children for coveted enjoyment? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel dejected.</p>
<p>When I graduated from university three years ago, the admonition of an old professor echoed in my ears again: "Your future is vast. I hope that each of you will be like a strong and healthy steed, galloping on a vast plain, roaring freely, living an ideal and successful life..." We young group listened attentively, encouraged by his exciting tone, holding our breath, not daring to breathe, each with a string of shining hopes in front of us, our faces full of smiles. But then the old professor said faintly in a somber tone: "But I warn you, the first thing, and only one thing; never get married too early... Alas, marriage is the most damaging thing to one's ambition, it is like a horse being hitched to a carriage, bound and restricted, reducing the speed of progress—then you will be seen to lag behind on the road of life... Haha, that's the most helpless thing, you know?" The old professor took a breath, and that sincere and aged attitude I still cannot forget, but at the time we all thought this was superfluous, a snake-like concern. Because what hung before us were piles of dazzling and impractical ideals!</p>
<p>But I left school, stepped into society, once ran around in panic from unemployment, then got married, then had children... In a hasty three years, I am already the father of two children, a family of four, struggling to live under the skyrocketing prices. The hardship is indescribable. And I, shouldering the heavy burden of life for four people, have tasted all the joys and sorrows of the world. I have to rush to write manuscripts at night in addition to my daytime work, but the result of working all day to make a living still feels like I can't make ends meet. Now, using me as an example of a horse pulling a cart is still not enough to describe it, it's simply a cow dragging a grinding stone. "Working like a horse and cow for children and grandchildren," my sigh does not contain resentment for being reduced to the hardship of a cow and horse. On the contrary, it is because I am so busy like a cow and horse, and still not enough to support my wife and children, that I really feel guilty inside. Usually, when I see their innocent smiles, their babbling cries, their naive little movements... these are interesting and pleasant materials for family life, but when I think of these things alone in a quiet place, I can't help but shed tears. What is the responsibility of a father? How can I make them more comfortable? These fruitless questions turn into countless small caterpillars, gnawing at my heart, and so I sob even more!</p>
<p>On a pitch-black night, sometimes I suddenly wake up from my bed, all sounds are silent, I only feel my tears, rolling like pearls, slipping on the pillow with a rustling sound. I wonder if there are so many tears; at this time, all worries are silent, and I feel the loneliness of the world, so I think of friends—why don't you have friends?</p>
<p>My wife often asks me with a reproachful tone, but behind the words, I have long guessed, blaming me for being reserved and not making a few rich friends, not willing to curry favor and follow worldly customs. In recent years, the opportunity to make a fortune has been as easy as turning one's hand, but I stubbornly refuse to speculate and hoard, and at the same time, I don't have the assistance of friends who can make connections, so that I am still a poor and shabby scholar. I am willing to silently endure my wife's ridicule. Since her intuitive concepts are already like this, it is futile to try to persuade her with empty words and lofty principles. And thinking of her hard work during the day for housework and caring for the children, venting her complaints to me is also out of a kind of helplessness. But because of this, I feel even more lonely on the road of life, even the person in the same bed is dreaming different dreams. How much more is it the case with strangers? And so my tears, one by one, drop by drop, flow, flow... At this time, the only comforter is these tears, right?</p>
<p>Short Letter</p>
<h3>Talking About How to Be a Person</h3>
<p>— Hu Shengquan</p>
<p>××, what words are appropriate for me to say to you? When we are in almost the same situation, and cannot calm our minds. I feel that explaining myself to you, or using a letter as a talisman to heal your "ennui," are both difficult things to do. Think about it, you barged into my life, it doesn't seem like a short time. I dare boldly assert that many of your habits were developed under my influence; if we fussed over these things, wouldn't it be too foolish? But you have been away from me for almost half a year, and in this half year, I have been tormented by the hardships of life for the first time. This torment has changed my thoughts and temper, often making me angrily helpless. Especially when I receive your letters, full of despairing words, it makes me feel injustice! Where do you get so much hatred, so many tears, so much pity? You have to think about my situation, if you are not willing to think of the larger and broader group of people suffering in every corner of the world.</p>
<p>If my words cause your aversion, then I have to cry! Who else in this world understands me even a little bit? This is what you know, I've lived for more than twenty years. I only recognized poverty last year. At first, its ferocious appearance frightened me so much that I didn't have the courage to struggle on this rugged path of life anymore. I compared myself to a drowning man from a wrecked ship. In the turbulent sea, what could I rely on to get life again? Later, I pinned my future on another kind of hope. I grabbed a lifebuoy. I tied up my heart that had been hurt by worries, and since then, I didn't think about myself very much. I felt that I should blame my own confusion: trying to ride a broken ship and brave the wind and waves? I flicked away the tears and smiled: You know some of my actual situation, and someone as sensitive as you will completely pity me. Several times in restaurants I pressed my hand on my pocket and couldn't pay the bill; close your eyes and think, how did I force a smile, how did I stammer with my friends, watching them take out their money while my face flushed red... You know I am not a very stingy person, why would I become like this? This is worth my deep consideration, worth my descendants' deep consideration. In a word: A person who only plans for himself will one day perish, this world does not allow you to live comfortably and take care of yourself!</p>
<p>××, I sympathize with this saying, a person without a mother is forever living in a winter without sunshine. But why do you hate society so much? You say you are clear water, and can never mix with oil stains. I feel that you are not extreme enough, you still cannot scientifically grasp the social problems of the current stage. Why don't you go a step further and say: you are alcohol, washing the oil stains clean, isn't this more courageous and meaningful?</p>
<p>You now live in a small country town. Although leaving the house full of siblings makes you miss them, working in the store as a "young master" probably makes life quite comfortable. What else do you want? You should be satisfied, knowing that no one's life is perfect, especially in this time of suffering. This is your problem, and also my problem, indulging in our own ideals and hating the reality of the environment, resulting in endless troubles. These troubles do not help our actual shortcomings, but make our emotions very fragile, what is the point? Now we should earnestly be people, train ourselves and strengthen ourselves through the hardships of life...</p>
<p>Your cousin Shengquan</p>
<h3>Traveler's Song</h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>Shouldering a heavy bag,</p>
<p>Stepping on the vast journey ahead.</p>
<p>Perilous and odd peaks soar into the clouds,</p>
<p>Thorns in the mustard field are like swords and blades.</p>
<p>Turbulent waves surpass mountain collapses,</p>
<p>Can the scorching sun and lake wind be forgiving?</p>
<p>Sometimes missing the lodgings,</p>
<p>The hand of darkness manipulates the dryness,</p>
<p>Torrential rain is as thick as giant ropes,</p>
<p>This situation is even more difficult.</p>
<p>However, a drop of water cannot compete with the ocean,</p>
<p>How can a bit of hardship stand up to endless joy?</p>
<p>Months accumulate into seasons, and seasons change into years,</p>
<p>I do not have a trace of hesitation or wandering.</p>
<p>A heavy bag cannot suppress the pounding of my heart,</p>
<p>How can a long road hinder my great ambitions!</p>
<p>In the journey of the past twenty-four years,</p>
<p>I have seen...</p>
<p>The majestic grandeur of the Himalayas,</p>
<p>The ever-changing state of the Pacific Ocean,</p>
<p>The Great Wall is as vast as a million warriors,</p>
<p>The wonder of the sunrise on Mount Tai is even more praised by everyone!</p>
<p>This is a heavenly book bestowed by nature,</p>
<p>More beautiful scenery is waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Look! The road keeps retreating under my feet,</p>
<p>How can I not sing with joy and elation!</p>
<h3>Puppet</h3>
<p>— Zhiming</p>
<p>This exquisitely carved puppet, seemingly born of nature itself, stands on my desk, trying its best to look at me, looking... unmoving, gazing without blinking... its round, snow-white face is offering me a smile! The dimples on its cheeks that never quite fade are also fully revealed before me, ah! Its smile is charming, its bearing is full, beautiful, lovely, is...</p>
<p>It also has golden hair, a snow-white tender face, jet-black pupils, slightly red lips, a pink dress, light green socks, shiny leather shoes... truly a young woman of the new era.</p>
<p>It stares blankly at me, and I stare dazedly back at it, this meeting of eyes intertwining like an electric current! Ah! Its character, lofty aspirations, agile movements, profound thoughts: it is a good youth, a good citizen, a good national. Besides all this, it also has one strength, which is also its weakness, and that is—self-effacement. Self-effacement is indeed a desirable trait in a young person, but too much self-effacement is also a weakness for a young person.</p>
<p>"Cai, excessive self-effacement can cause wounds in friendship!" I often told him this.</p>
<p>Now it has left this world! Although its body still rests peacefully beneath the earth, its soul is separated from us!</p>
<p>It has been three years since we last met, a full three years! This living separation and death brings back memories, enough to cause pain! Then, since it is so painful, let's forget about it, let's not remember it anymore! But even though I say this, its image continues to appear in my mind, appearing...</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>"Mandarin Ducks After the Calamity"</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>...Zhang Jing, who played Li Shishi in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," was unable to fully display her talents due to the limitations of the script; "Mandarin Ducks After the Calamity" gave Miao more opportunities to act. Tao Yinghua is a tragic woman, falling from the niece of a wealthy merchant to a prostitute, going through several stages in between. Zhang Jing's acting has achieved very good results. The most successful part is the inner performance. When Yinghua is at her wit's end and contemplates suicide on the bridge, the expression of despair and pain intertwined is truly moving, especially when the director uses fantastical sounds to depict her inner voice, just as she is about to jump into the water, a sudden thought flashes through her mind.</p>
<p>...Xu Ting, who played Yinghua's uncle, was not as successful as he was in "Blood Splattered Hibiscus," where he played the leader of the private soil traffickers. The personalities of these two characters are very different, one is insidious, while the other is merely fatuous and stern. Xu Cong's acting has more sternness than necessary, and not enough fatuity. Pu Ke's student looks a bit old in appearance. The stepmother is too artificial. There is also an unimportant fat maid who, besides being over the top, seems to know how to act.</p>
<p>...It is necessary to mention Zhang Yi. He was the male lead in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," but here he plays a despicable vagrant. Although there are only a few scenes, his expression is realistic. Zhang Yi is more to be expected if he is nurtured by an excellent director.</p>
<p>...The story is indeed not worthy of high praise. The ending, which forces a reunion between father and son, is not only undesirable but simply destroys the mood and unity of the entire play. It is also too coincidental that so many misfortunes are concentrated on Yinghua alone. However, speaking in fragments, it does partially reflect a claw of the reality of society. Here, there is human selfishness and private gain, taking advantage of disasters, and the evil forces of various lines and doors are fully exposed. There is also the reason why all kinds of deputy people are heading towards "lowliness." - Although the playwright's portrayal is obviously not deep enough. If this film is still worth watching, this should be a very important point. The music is well-matched. The shots are not lively. The dubbing is still terrible!</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper's Scholarship Fundraiser, Charity Football Match Held Today, Overseas Chinese Team Invited to Fight Donghua, All Sectors of Society Enthusiastically Sponsor</h3>
<p>— Mei Bixian</p>
<p>The charity football and basketball games for the scholarship fund for our newspaper's readers, after more than a month of planning and through President Chen's liaising with various parties, are now all in order. The football match will be held at 5:30 pm today at the racecourse on Huangpi Road.</p>
<p>All Sectors Enthusiastically Sponsor</p>
<p>For today's charity game, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi of the Football Federation is invited to be the commander-in-chief, and Shen Huichun assists in all matters. Furthermore, Mr. Shen Siliang, Pan Sanxing, Tan Jing, Tong Wenrui, and other gentlemen, as well as all related parties, have all made every effort to sponsor, enabling the smooth progress. Men and women from all walks of life have also enthusiastically purchased tickets and participated. Benefiting impoverished students, our newspaper expresses its infinite gratitude.</p>
<p>Celebrities Kick-Off and Award Prizes</p>
<p>The opposing teams for today are the ever-victorious Chinese Donghua team and the Overseas Chinese team, which has been transformed into a righteousness-espousing team. The latter took advantage of the opportunity before the Tianjin team returned north and temporarily invited four generals to help in the battle, greatly increasing its strength. It is expected that there will be a shocking battle. Today's game tickets cost 200 yuan for the public grandstand. The honor tickets in the venue are divided into three types: 2,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. All enter the venue through the gate of the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, Mr. Lin Kanghou will be invited to perform the opening kick-off ceremony, and Miss Li Xiangguan, a star from Man Ying Film, will present the awards. Our newspaper has specially prepared two large silver shields to present to the two teams participating in the competition as souvenirs. All proceeds from today's ticket sales will be used to fund our newspaper's scholarship fund for readers, contributing every bit to the public good. All expenses will be paid separately by our newspaper. Therefore, this charity game is expected to merge football fans and movie fans into one event, and everyone will compete to be the first to attend, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. After all, one can both enjoy the ultimate football game and catch a glimpse of the real face of a movie star, and also contribute to helping impoverished students, achieving three gains in one fell swoop. Why wouldn't people be happy to go?</p>
<p>Donghua's Morale is High, Striving to Maintain Victory</p>
<p>Examining the recent situation of the Donghua team, it is felt that their offense has a path and their defense has a technique, getting better and better. The recent victory over the Tianjin team with a score of three to zero is even more brilliant. All the soldiers are at their peak. What is most worth mentioning is that the three veterans, Dai Linjing, Liang Shutang, and Zhuang Youren, once showed signs of aging, but recently, not only have they gradually recovered, but they also have the spirit of their past glory. According to what the reporter has learned, the team practices twice a week, and this phenomenon is by no means accidental. They will still use their best lineup to face today's battle, and they should have a winning situation. However, in military affairs, there must be no pride or laziness, so there will be no abnormal performance. Moreover, today the Overseas Chinese team is trying a new lineup, with generals helping in the battle both in the front and the back, creating a rather unpredictable style of play. Examining the lineup they have announced and exploring their intentions, nothing is beyond the following: Dare to offer humble opinions before Donghua.</p>
<p>Their defense abandons Mai Qidi and uses Tianjin's Jiang Dou and others, because Jiang is full of energy and can block Li Yao's activity and stick to Sun Jinshun to the death, and can also use his spare time to help the left guard's lack, so as to hold Han Longhai's fierce rushes. In the previous two wars, there were indeed successes. Therefore, in my humble opinion, Donghua should know this and find a way to break it. The only way is to still use Xiao Han's fierce rushes. However, Xiao Han's rush should focus on blocking and covering the opponent's defenders, so that A Dai, Jinshun, and Li Yao can all take the opportunity to contribute. The adjustment of their midfield line is not ideal. The most obvious is the use of Tianjin's general, Bonini, as the left midfielder, which is to curb the attack of Longhai and Youliang. However, with Youliang's skills and Xiao Han's run, it may not be poisoned by it. As for their forward line, reading the list and discussing their individual skills, they are all above the standard. However, it is impossible to speculate on how their contact is. In short, the two needles on the left and right, Bao Jie and Yatomari, can call forward and respond backward, serving as the blood vessels for the attack. The two wings are still reasonably ideal. The use of Otoniro as the main center forward is definitely intended to contain old Tan, or even come back to nail old Tan, intending to destroy Donghua's midfield line and seek a central breakthrough. Therefore, old Tan should know the enemy's plan, not be calculated by them, otherwise they will be in vain. If Donghua can maintain its normal state, then the ever-victorious army will sing a triumphant song steadily, what is there to fear?</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Team is Approaching to Help, Making People Fear</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese team has been twice defeated by the Chinese team and is unwilling to give up. Just in time, our newspaper invited them to participate in the war, and we were also delighted to meet the good relationship of Tianjin's team staying in Shanghai, so we invited four righteous generals from Tianjin to join, aiming for a victory to express this accumulated resentment. The new lineup announced for today's war, especially the hardness of the front line, makes people fear. Center forward Otoniro, a veteran of the central defender, is quick on his feet and fierce on his head. Today, he will definitely try to launch a cold arrow, and Bang Lun should pay attention. The two forwards on his left flank belong to the same team in Tianjin and have good connections. They will definitely have a wonderful performance, which will pose a major threat to Donghua's Zhang Linggen and Zhuang Youren.</p>
<p>In short, Donghua may not be able to win easily in today's battle and must go through a bloody battle and work hard on strategy. Therefore, the excitement of the game can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Three Basketball Games Held on the 12th, 14th, and 16th</h3>
<p>The charity basketball game has already contacted the Zhongqing to fight against the Xiqing, adopting a three-game two-win system. It is scheduled to be held on the 12th, 14th, and 16th of this month, at 7:30 pm at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Gymnasium. According to Zhongqing, the elites of the Hualian, Yaoren, and Yushan teams are gathered together, and Zhang Yuixiang and Yu Xunshi are doing their best to train them. Their performance level is beyond the past, there can be no objection. The Xiqing is also a mixed army of the giant Monok, with many tricks and novel tactics. Therefore, the three dragon-tiger fights will definitely add a lot of brilliance to our newspaper's scholarship fund charity game. It is truly the only good show after the basketball season, and also the feast for the eyes of fans, and indirectly the good fortune of impoverished students.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Team's Strength, Defense is Far Better Than Offense, Mission Announced, All Will Soon Return North</h3>
<p>The Tianjin team came to Shanghai for four battles and finished all of them yesterday after fighting the Shanghai West team. The first battle with the Shanghai United team, this magazine has reviewed its process in the last issue. Now, let's review the last three battles to send off the Tianjin team.</p>
<p>Second Battle: Lost to Donghua</p>
<p>In this battle, the Tianjin team passed the ever-victorious Donghua team. Although the inner guards tried their best to resist, they were finally rushed into the hinterland by Donghua with a small pass. In the second half, the iron leg's shot near the door, Tal Douka could not resist either. Therefore, the Tianjin team's failure in this battle, in terms of defense, can be said to have done its duty. As for the offensive aspect, the reason why it failed to break through Donghua's door is the following two reasons. This is a fact recognized by most people: 1. The Tianjin team's forward line is too scattered. When attacking, the two inner forwards are too behind, so the Donghua defense line rarely suffers threats. 2. The Tianjin team's personnel changes are too many, especially in the second half, most of the time is spent on the frequent mobilization of reserve members, which is amazing. Therefore, it is naturally difficult to seek a pure and sharp offensive.</p>
<p>As for the three goals lost in this battle by the Tianjin team, the first goal was that the wind helped Donghua to seize the lead, which greatly increased morale. The second goal, A Dai's one dial, and the third goal, Lao Sun's close-range shot, were both incurable. In this battle, Tianjin only had defense and no offense, and it was unlikely that it would not lose.</p>
<p>Third Battle: First Victory over Lianyi</p>
<p>In this battle, the Tianjin team took advantage of Lianyi's lack of endurance in the second half, with Bonini and Bo Tailitini each contributing a goal, and then achieved the first victory. But on the other hand, Lianyi's ball luck was extremely bad, coupled with Tal Douka's high catches and blocks, the Tianjin team's slight gain in face was entirely due to Lianyi's defeat. Some commentators said that if Lianyi did not withdraw from the Lianxiang and practiced more often, the Tianjin team might not be able to win.</p>
<p>As for Lyepan Bies's appearance in the second half, it made the Tianjin team's offensive stronger. If they still used the method of mobilizing the forwards in the previous two games, they could only draw at most. Therefore, under the two principles of the Tianjin team not adjusting personnel and the opponent not having endurance, slightly comforting the courage and spirit of the soldiers, they can use the victory of tactics.</p>
<p>Fourth Battle: Another Draw with the West Team</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the last battle with the West team, both sides were calm and the atmosphere in the stadium was very relaxed. As a result, the Tianjin team relied on A. Corasha's foul, and Yatomari penalized a twelve-yard ball, and then drew with the West team again with one goal each. The Tianjin team's offensive in this battle was still not as strong as the West team's. The reason for not losing is that the West team lacked tacit understanding and did not appear with an ideal lineup, so both sides came and went, and there was nothing worth seeing.</p>
<p>Looking at the Tianjin team's strength, defense is better than offense, which can be clearly seen in the four games. This time, the forward soul Qiao Xiang was not there, and the offensive was naturally greatly reduced. What is most impressive is the defensive line of the goalkeeper and the inner guards.</p>
<p>The Tianjin team will return north tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. This trip is still worthwhile. They defeated Lianyi but lost to Donghua, and drew with Shanghai and West, which is very average. This trip is gone, and I hope to come again in the future, with significant progress in tactics, so that fans here will have deep expectations.</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Method (10) (9)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, Translated by Yide</p>
<p>33. Forward and Backward Bending</p>
<p>Stand upright. Put your hands on your hips. Expand your chest. Contract your hips and abdomen backward, and slowly bend your body downward, the lower the better, until the muscles behind your calves are extremely tense. Do not lower your head to avoid excessive blood flow to the brain. Do not bend your knees.</p>
<p>Slowly raise your body back to its original position, then lean backward and bend your knees to avoid excessive tension and injury. Maintain your balance, even if your heels leave the ground.</p>
<p>After you are familiar with the above posture (just a few practice sessions are enough), you can raise your hands over your head instead of putting them on your hips, so that your chest and abdomen are raised. Swing your arms backward over your head, and your body also leans backward, with your knees slightly bent. Then lean forward, with your center of gravity on your feet, without bending your knees, and try to touch the ground with your fingertips. Note how far your fingers are from the ground at the beginning of practice, and gradually your fingertips can touch the ground.</p>
