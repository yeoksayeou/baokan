<h3>拙誠</h3>
<p>拙誠的意義就是誠心誠意的說實話，做實事。中國近代史上最提倡拙誠而又最有成效的，便是會國藩。他在湘鄉昭忠祠記裹說：[世之亂也，上下縱於亡等之欲，姦僞相吞，變詐相角，自圖其安，而予人以至危，畏難避害，會不捐絲粟之力，以拯天下。得忠誠者起而矯之，克已而愛人，去僞而從拙，吾鄉數君子所以鼓舞羣倫，歷九洲而戡大亂，非拙且誠者之效歟]。這是會國藩一生事業成功的秘廖，在目前虛僞浮滑的社會上，更值得我們的欽佩，更值得我們的效法。　　說實話，做實事並不是一件難事，可是說實話最容易得罪人，做實事更容易爲人所中傷。說實話的人最注重是非，他決不能文非飾過，決不能將是作非，說實話的目的在乎辯明眞是非，是非之間不容有線毫的假借，不容有些微的取巧，因此說話愈老實，愈易得罪人，說老實話愈多，得罪的人亦愈多。其次，做實事只是實事求是把工作成績來表現，做實事的人不誇張，不敷衍，不茍且，在做事的過程中，他更是本着一定的宗旨勇往直前，一點不能通融，一點不能妥洽，因此做事愈刻實，愈易爲人所中傷，做刻實事務愈多，中傷他的人也愈多。所以實行[拙誠]兩個字之前，先要有大無畏的勇氣，和犧牲的決心。世界上的眞理只有一條，惟有說實話做實事的人方才能夠把這個眞理宣揚，更能使這個眞理鞏固。　　中國目前處在一個最最困難的環境中，此時此地，只有努力前進，然後能夠推陳出新，另造一個新局面，使國家民族復興。此時此地正需要無數的拙誠獃子，共同努力這一性工作，挽狂波於未瀾，扶大廈之將傾，在中國五千餘年的歷史上，仁人志士光榮的言行，眞是舉不勝舉，這是中華民族立國的根本。把過去的歷史，觀察現在的情況，我們不能不指出目前最危險的一點，就是，目前的局面如是的艱苦困難，而說實話做實事的人，實在還只寥寥可數，這個現象是一般人所耳熟目覩的，無容我們諱言，可是這是中國最嚴重的病症。　　造成這個病症的原因，個人社會政府三方面都要負責任。個人的沒有勇氣，沒有決心，自然是基本原因。可是有了勇氣，有了決心，假如沒有社會的摧助，同志的協力，少數人的工作必定是事倍功半，得不到鉅大的效果。再次，政府的獎掖維護，最足以鼓勵全國人民的勇氣，最足以提起全國人民的決心。個人社會政府三方面必須通力合作，造成一種[拙誠]的風氣，使大家放胆說實話，做實事，凡是不說實話，不做實事的人自然淘汰。我們看世界各國的復興史，幾乎沒有一個國家不從苦幹實幹中得來，中國如若希望復興，先要提倡苦幹實幹的[拙誠]風氣。　　最後，我們不但要對政府說老實話，尤其要對盟邦說老實話，以期毫無隔閡。</p>
<h3>日首相籲請人民協力爭決戰勝利盼各就本位努力增強戰力</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日小磯首相頃於第三十四屆大詔奉載日上午六時三十分，作廣播演講，向全國國民呼籲各盡本分，努力工作，響應前綫將士之血戰，保持日本之主力地位，以完成擊滅英美之大任。茲誌其大意如次：現在敵軍雖蒙受重大損害，然仍積極從事中部太平洋方面之進攻作戰，同時並經新幾內亞島而於摩羅泰島登陸，彼等之包圍顯在以此爲前進基地，窺伺菲律賓，並進而遮斷日本本土與南方之聯絡。此外彼等更覬觀北千島方面，謀與駐渝美空軍相呼應，反覆對日本作大規模之空襲，藉以毀壞日本之軍需工塲，更進而於日本土登陸，使日軍陷于難以繼續作戰之狀態。</p>
<h3>確保主動地位進而支配戰局</h3>
<p>但敵人驕狂之處，必有令我等可以乘隙進攻，敵軍補給綫愈行擴大，則兵力疏弱點愈多，反之，日軍之防綫則愈趨堅固，此點誠係令敵人感到對日作戰極爲棘手之處。於是我等當乘機一舉摧毀敵人，鞏守主動地位，以進而支配今後之戰局。固然把握戰機與勇兵作戰之妙，均在於統帥部之運籌帷幄，但其成果則當置全幅信賴於將士之奮戰。雖然日軍縱如何精悍，茍無充足之空軍及其他武器，則赫赫戰果亦係空中樓閣難以實現。故欲得到良好之成果，非充分供給必要之食糧·大部之飛機·及其他武器不可，而引等供給食糧及武器之重任，即負於吾人。</p>
<h3>響應前綫將士求達戰爭目的</h3>
<p>最近國內空氣益形明朗，而一億同胞均能挺身於職塲以境強戰力，此誠令人可慰者。不論任何人其成果之大，悉依人精神力之強弱以爲斷，以道義爲依歸，日本全體國民具有同仇敵愾之志，必能使戰力在質與量和劃期之增強，至爲敵所誇張之物質力量，實決不足恐懼。吾人深信吾人志能以勝利結束行將來臨之決戰，有以道義爲依歸之日本一億國民之必勝信念，始是獲得勝利之關鍵。所以此時乃是大政翼贊會等提携展開國民運動擊滅英美之時，此次國民運動之目的，係在使國民同胞明瞭此次大詔所示之戰爭目的，係在確立東亞之安定與世界之和平，使英美稱覇東亞之野心悉遭挫折。</p>
<h3>全國萬衆一心發揮道義精神</h3>
<p>目下之戰局已反映出日本後方之生產，未能充分對抗敵人之總反攻，今後政府對同胞所懷種種之有益意見，將盡量採綱，藉使與凡國民自覺敢門明朗鞏固，各就本位努力於生產之增強，然而此種自覺敢門必須身體力行，非僅僅通瞭事理氣分明朗所能有濟。總之欲打開目下非常時局，必須在第一綫獲得成功，使行將降臨之決戰得以貫澈，此實有賴於將兵之勇戰與敢門，我一億同胞尤須以貫澈國體本義爲基礎，從事修養訓練爲一道義之國民。欲求增強戰力，必須把持強鞏之必勝信念，使其堅鞏力於不知不覺間充分發揮，以爭取戰爭之勝利。</p>
<h3>緬甸太平洋日軍一週間戰況</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電週間戰況哪次：　　緬甸方面　松池地區日軍部隊刻正對龍陵及芒市周圍地區之雲南遠征軍加以掃蕩中。最近龍陵東方地區，渝第十一集團軍所部第二軍，頗有向芒市東側地區進展之勢，而繼越附近渝第二十集團軍所部集五十三五十四兩軍，則似欲向龍陵西北地區前進。　　北太平洋　九月廿七廿八日十月三日四日五日等五日間，敵機累計二十九架來襲北千島，最後一日於空虎時擊落二架，（內不確者一架）擊毀二架。　　中太平洋　帛琉羣島方面之培里琉島及安格維爾島方面之日守軍，目前均已寡兵應戰中，敵軍以日軍發揮勇武精神，連日備受重創。又九月下旬在加羅林西部海面行動之敵航空母艦羣，嗣後並未有顯著行動。摩羅泰島方面日軍戰綫並無重大變化，敵軍正銳意建設飛行塲中，該方面敵兵力推測約在一師團以上，雙敵軍似已在該方面完成飛行塲一處。　　西南太平洋　方面敵機空襲日方基地依然熾烈，六日白晝，敵大型中型機五十架來襲西里伯島之南部及北部地區，爲日軍擊落B25型機二架。又五日晨敵大型機約四十架來襲安波那島之波拉地區，及五日未明，敵P38型機約廿五架來襲新幾內亞，五日夜敵中型機二架來襲婆羅洲之峇厘把板，又六日敵P38型機約十餘架來襲菲律賓，五日白晝敵中型機等約計廿三架，來襲拉巴爾，該地日軍部隊擊落敵機三架，六日又有敵機八十架來襲·此次敵機之空襲，實係敵軍企圖擾亂日軍南方資源地帶之戰略轟炸之表現，殊堪注目</p>
<h3>菲財次抵日發表談話</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電據福岡電話：菲律賓共和國政府財政次長兼審計局長培德氏，茲因要務來日，七日下午飛抵福岡暫住一宿，翌晨再乘機東下。該氏於福岡會發表談話如次：菲律賓自對英美宣戰以來，即傾物心兩面所有力量從事戰爭，刻下菲律賓一千八百萬國民，正在誓與日本同生共死之決心下，向擊滅英美之大道邁進。關於財政方面，因洛勒爾總統及政府官吏等之刻苦奮鬥，各種難題已迎刃而解，同時與日本方面協力之工作亦逐漸實現</p>
<h3>日內閣顧問結城氏來華</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電日內閣顧問大東亞顧問結城　太郎氏，爲考察中國產業經濟現況，於七日上午九時偕日本銀行理事柳田城一郎氏等，由此間起程赴華。</p>
<h3>東條公畢離滿</h3>

<h3>水島組新政府</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　德國社訊：據倫敦無綫電播稱，水島總統已委任水島解放黨領袖托爾組織新政府。</p>
<h3>日軍登陸作戰粉碎英美企圖</h3>
<p>福州日軍發表談話　　日軍前綫日軍基地八日中央社電　福州方面日軍，七日發表談話如次：敵軍圖由新幾內亞方面北上，攻略菲律賓台灣，迫至中國本土，以遮斷日本本土與南方資源圈之連絡。反之，日軍則已將浙東沿岸要衝溫州佔領後，又攻佔渝方僅存之最後海口福州，（日軍已於四日上午八時突入福州。）此間日軍，以作戰部隊緊密協力，而使本作戰順利成功。該方面渝軍司令官，爲福建省主席劉建緒，計有渝第七十軍所屬第八十師，保安縱隊，及海軍部隊等共約一萬五千人。當時渝軍會作意想外之頑強抵抗，致使日軍攻略部隊，不得不對之加以攻擊。然日軍登陸部隊，尤愼重防範駐渝美空軍，及出現於近海之敵方潛水艇活動，故以海軍部隊　由海空兩方面加以嚴重攻擊。作戰前日軍會作週到之準備，期獲萬全。但因天氣不佳，未見敵軍出現，故日軍作戰行動，未受何種妨碍，登陸即告成功。攻略福州，無論於政治·經濟·軍事各方面，均有重大意義。如福州會爲閩省首府，面積約佔上海及香港之二分之一，面臨日本台灣，爲華南第二都市，非僅於政治經濟上佔有重要地位，更有各種軍事設施，及造船所，海軍學校等，其於軍事上之重要性極大。日軍佔據該地，實予渝軍以重大打擊，更粉碎美軍進攻大陸止企圖。最後聲明一點，即日軍於此地從事登陸作戰，實爲澈底打倒頑敵美英，非以美良之中國軍民爲敵，決始終相互提携，共同擊滅美英，齊向建設新中國途上邁進云。</p>
<h3>大東亞青少年指導會議</h3>
<p>定今日在京揭幕　　南京八日中央社電當茲大東亞戰爭步入最後決戰階段，吾東亞十億民族，誓以堅強之決意，結成鐵的陣綫，共同擊滅宿敵英美，而向完成大東亞共榮圈，建設大道邁進。大東亞青少年所應負之責任，亦愈形重大，自應益加淬勵，以圖報效。爰於十月九日，在我國首都南京，召開第二次大東亞青少年指導會議，集大東亞青少年團代表於一堂，加緊商討協力大東亞戰爭之方案，以期發揮全力，貢獻於大東亞共榮圈之永久確立。大會儀式已決定於九日下午二時半，在新還會揭幕，並於會議舉行前，上午八時，由議長林柏生，率領全體代有幹事隨員等，赴國父陸襄謁陵致敬。並將致祭中國國民革命烈士祠，及援助中國革命日本同志紀念祠。各國青少年代表幹事隨員等，均憶紛紛抵京，計我國十一人，　本八人，滿洲四人，菲律賓一人，印度一人，大東亞青少年團協力會事務局一人。</p>

<h3>西綫殿開秋季大攻勢</h3>
<p>亞琛區發生坦克大戰　　柏林八日中央社電海通社訊：德軍事發言人昨夜評述英美所稱[德境亞琛區發生坦克車大會戰]一項消息曰，亞琛附近之坦克車戰，誠可　爲在德境第一次發生之坦克車大會戰，但德軍在此防禦戰中，今已擊毀敵坦克車六十九輛，足證德軍射擊坦克車武器之銳利。　　柏林八日中央社電海通社訊：西綫秋季大戰日趨激烈，德軍前日共擊毀敵坦克車八十五輛，加拿大軍在安特衛普迤北十八公里及透恩霍特運河西北進攻，均被德軍擊退。德軍在蒂爾堡西南十二公里之處反攻順利，德軍在下萊因與瓦爾之間進攻，尤有良好之進展。英軍在安亨西南五公里出動坦克車進攻，現正在激戰中。美軍昨續在亞琛迤北，行其突破企圖，自巴倫堡（Paienberg）推進，已進抵貝根杜夫（Beggendorf）西南二公里之處，惟所付代價極大，德軍現正發動反攻中。反軸心軍向基倫克迤南進擊，被德軍擊退。梅茲區昨無大戰，魯納維爾東北戰事，仍在百樂（Parroy）森林地帶進行中，法軍在佛日山脈迤西得美軍之助，向山區進攻無進展。</p>
<h3>威爾基逝世</h3>

<h3>泛阿拉伯大會閉幕宣言</h3>

<p>[各位先生：奉主席命令，兄弟在會中報告，王張兩先生與中共中央同兄弟四個月來商談經過。兄弟對於這件事情，感覺到十分興奮，十分榮幸。國共關係，應該有俊平合理的調整，在現在政治的塲合中，這是一件要緊的事情。不僅參政會同人關心，亦爲全國人民所注意。今天我要報告大會的，就是我們四個月中與張主兩先生商談的過程。這商談過程中，大致有七個比較重要的文件，這些文件也有書面，各位可查閱過。這次商談中，延安政府抱非常誠懇的態度，希望中央能夠把一切問題解決，並希望能夠報告蔣委員長。這些問題雖還沒有獲得最後解決，仍與張王兩先生在非常友好的情形下商談中，因爲我們商談的三件主要事情是要求得解決的。　　（一）軍政的解決。張王兩先生認爲是要解決的問題，而共產黨也希望解決，但迄今不能解決。這些內容雖一時不能報告，但總而言之，我們雙方的意見還不能趨於一致，不過我們應該坦白的告訴參政會同仁，不能解決的關鍵所在，就是我們的意見還有分岐之點。這些文件中主要的是什麼？照我們的觀點，我想有二點：第一點就是怎麼樣從基本上解決這些問題，我想信我國有四萬萬五千萬的人民，這就是力量，但用什麼方法來團結，就是實行民主政治，實行民主政治的確能夠挽救國家的災難，如何實行，業經建議要求實行三民主義抗戰建國綱領，及中共頒之下大綱領。這三件能夠施行，就能團結全國人民，就能加強抗戰力量。在抗戰初起時，蔣委員長宣示過地無分南北，民無分老幼，全國人民要團結奮起，保衛國家。這樣我們的力量才可以強大。第二點中共要求的有些問題，這些問題，是軍事上的問題，在蘆溝橋事變前，我們會提出希望國民黨做些什麼事情，我們中共做些什麼事情，其中主要的，可以說我們政治問題，希望中央在政治上就是對於全國人民有言論出版及身體之自由，各黨各派合流的存在。實行地方自治。現在抗戰已有八個年頭，軍事政治情形，自然有了許多變化發展。在抗戰起初的九月二十二日，共產黨發表宣言，蔣委員長於二十三日發表談話，解決一切問題。譬如軍事問題，在陝北有八萬人，中央准編三師，四萬五千人，戰爭需要兵員現在經了七年多的抗戰，軍隊有發展，一切均入正軌，軍隊已有（四七五○○○）人，民衆的武力有二百二十萬人，因此軍事方面，我們希望中央編成五個軍十六個師，這是我們提出來的軍事方面的要求。　　（二）在政治方面：已經成立許多中國政權，如河北，出東，綏遠等共十五個單位，這些地方都是實行人民選舉制，這些實行民權的人民有八千八百萬，這些地方有關過二次民衆選，有些開過一次管理這些政權，指導民權，這是關於民政方面我們的要求。　　（三）我們要求合法存在以前共產黨做了些什麼，希望中央給些什麼便利，各黨派能合法存在，共產黨也要求公開的合法存在，這是比較重要的。還有其他的問題，但信上都有不必一個一個說出來。這是我們所商談的一個基本民主政治，一個是中共一些懸案的要求解決，我們認爲重要的在這次商談中，已提出來，中央有一個提示案，張文伯先生和我說應該照這個提示案辦理，我們覺得或我們提出來與提示案差有距離，還沒有解決，我想只把這些重要的提出來，一些小事情信上都有。這些距離有五分岐，分岐在什麼地方？譬如剛才說的，中共領導的正規軍隊有四十七萬，另有二百萬民軍，照現在的數字，可以編到四十七師，我們爲中央統籌全局計，不是這樣提出來的，這個中間當然有一個過程，周恩來在三月十二日中山先生逝世紀念會上提出這個話，我們一方面顧及中央全盤劃籌，雖然可以編四十七個師，但現在決定編十八個師的番號，六個軍，以後左一個商量，右一個商量，說是還是困難，我們中共又減爲五個軍十六個師，而中央的提示案，是四個軍十個師，這些軍隊都在前方戰塲，單位過少，不好指揮，所以要求數字上增加中央提示案，對於這些軍隊編後要集中使用，沒有編列的，趕快取消，現在我們正天天懷着不打仗是不可能的，集中起來很困難，至於黨派的事實存在，及許多民主上的問題，我們認爲需要，我們舉幾個例，譬如我們愈使得言論出版自由，這一直到此次開參政會還沒有達到。又人民身體自由，於七月間公布條例，這個辦法，雖是公布了，可是沒有辦到。比方新四軍事件，被捕人員沒有審判，葉挺不是共產黨，那時中共當局要保出來。又廖承志，張文彬等，廣東被扣，我們希望這些人以及其他很多政治犯，同時釋放，故現在保障人民身體自由辦法公布後，希望中央做幾件事實出來，這是比較基本上分析。我們所希望的與中央提示案不同，我們希望這個提示案距我們的意見能夠接近，剛才說的比較重要，自然還有些次要的。比方我們在西安與張王兩先生談話，兩先生作爲初步意見，將來寫了書以後，作爲兩黨參考。但是中央指示提案說是林代表涵福所表示的意見，也是張王兩先生的誤會，這件事我們只談了三小時就決定的。張王兩先生歷次說到這件事，所以說明一下，也是很小的岐異。尚有轉入第二版</p>

<h3>渝共談判經過</h3>
<p>（自第一版轉來）　　再說我們談判的經過，去年國民黨十一中全會會決議對中共問題用政治方式解決，延安方面聽了這個消息，很高興，非常贊成，因爲自二十九年新四軍事件以後，局勢僵持，我是參政員，也因爲封鎖了不能出來，十一中全會後，我們得到中央之許可，得以出來，但以邊區時耕運動的關係，到四月二十九日始離延安，一到西安，不期而遇到張王兩先生，又因當時沒有飛機來渝，五月四日即在西安和張王兩先生開始商談，一共談了五次，這次商談是初步交換意見，最後報告中央，當時兩位先生問我有什麼意見，我說中共中央對商談問題也會商量過，周恩來在延安三月十二日孫中山先生逝世紀念會上，有一篇演講詞，可以這篇講詞爲商談基礎，其中一講民主和憲政，二是談國共許多懸案的解決，張王兩先生說這些事要到重慶再說，現在的重點是軍事，軍事問題一是縮小編制，二是減少數額，我說我們軍隊有四十七萬多人，問中央准許編多少，張先生同我面談，我說六軍十八師，張先生說太多，爲這件事就談了三天，前兩年林彪師長會提出編爲四軍十二師的要求，張先生會帶了當時談話的紀錄，提出以前這個要求，我說這點意思可以報告中共中央去考慮。還有許多問題是涉及政治的，在文件上都有的，最後一次商談會作成一個紀錄。前一天雷震先生把這紀錄給我看，標題是[與林祖涵先生，談話所得結果]，要我簽字，我說這是兩方面的意見，經我修改後簽了字，我也請他們簽字，他們二位說這不是條款，他們不需簽字，要轉呈中央請示，這是初步商談的經過。十七日飛到重慶來，中共中央接到了我的電報，很快的在二十日就根據我的電報寫了二十條，頭四條講民主，希望政府即刻實行言論出版集會結社及人身自由。第二是承認中共合法存在，和釋放政治犯。第三是實行地方自治，後面有些小問題。二十二日送給張王兩位先生，張王兩先生看了以後，以爲後面有些小問題有點刺激，帶回給我。我問他們有什麼意見，張王兩先生以爲改爲十二條，其餘八條是小問題作爲口頭講，這八條小問題看起來不大，在我們延安看來還是大問題。延安在六月三日接到我的東西，又來了個十二條。六月四日就送給張王兩位先生，後來就把中央提示案十八條送到延安去，張王兩先生對我的信表示不能接受。我想我是代表中國共產黨，應該送給蔣委員長，我六月十一晶寫信給他們兩位，他們兩位覆信說把我的信送給中央了。以後相隔了一個很遠的時間，梁部長有次在談話會上說是商談停頓，中共要覺悟才好，有些新聞記者來問我，我說祗要對抗戰有利益，我們都可以做。七月二十六日梁部長又發表英文談話，共有四點，說是此次談話一部份是解決了，一部份則是不能解決的，不過中國不會打內戰，有些新聞記者又來問我。周恩來八月十三日也有談話，中共希望解決這件事，並希望張王兩先生能來延安商談，我也轉給他們，他們以爲可以商量。八月十日回給我一封信，八月三十日我又復了一封信，一共七個文件，各位先生看了便可以明白談判的經過了。我來的意思，是中共同志很想把這個問題解決，是非常誠懇的，我來了四個月，到現在仍和兩位先生密切接觸，兩位先生也和我解釋這件事情，但是問題到今天仍是沒有解決。中共希望中央政府解決這個問題，現在國內需要我們團結，尤其各黨派間的團結，可是事情很明顯，四個月來的商量，要告訴各位還有點距離。]</p>
<h3>王雲五胡霖意見</h3>
<p>王雲五胡霖九月十五日上午聽取關於中共問題商談經過之報告後，向大會發表意，王氏謂：[今天聽了林參政員和張部長的報告，我把他歸納起來，最重要的問題祗有兩個：一是政權公開，一是軍令統一。政權公開，是中共所提的，其實不但中共所主張，我想全國人民也同樣的主張，而國民黨和政府也是一再宣佈他們還政於民的決心。軍令統一是政府所提出的，當然這也不但是政府的主張，也是全國人民的主張，就是中共也是贊成的。中共四項諾言中的第四，也是明白申言十八集團軍願意在軍委管轄之下，接受軍委會指揮，在林師長彪的四個條件之中，也有服從中央的字樣，在西安中央代表所提的意見中，也有這一條。今又聽到林參政員懇切坦白的申言中，決心實踐四項諾言，這就是說軍令統一，也不成問題，今天已由林參政員言中懇切地表現出來了。在這兩大原則之下，一個參政權公開，一個軍令統一，雙方都同意，都沒有異議，從這兩個原則下去求解決，那有不能解決的問題。此外，對政府方面我願意提出下列二點：第一，剛才聽張部長報告，政府對這個問題的解決，確實用寬大的政策，我個人很希望政府在寬大之中，更能寬大一點。第二，現在即使不能實行眞正的憲政，但是能進一步向憲政的路上走。對於中共方面，我們也有二點意見：第二，中共所提出的各項意見，有許多原則上我都贊成，但我個人的意見，很希望中共在實際上，能有事實的表現。剛才張部長的報告，說軍令統一是一個大問題，照我在上面的申述，這個問題實在不成問題；不過我們很希望多多在事實表現出來。第二，我很希望雙方商談之後，能夠一個結子一個結子的解開，不要一個沒有解決，又增加另一個，關於條件問題，我還沒把這些資料細細看過，不過總希望結子不要增。]胡霖謂：[今天上午林參政員的報告，非常確實，參政會同仁都是在中國政治界多少年的戰士，到參政會報告要以公開坦白的態度；因爲理論宣傳到參政會沒有用，政治界戰士的參政員不是宣傳可以動搖，每一位都有獨立判斷，我們不是審判，但都有判斷能力，不僅我們參政員判斷能力，抗戰以來，一般老百姓智識程度增加很多，所以老百姓也不是可以欺騙的，不是理論與空洞好聽的話可以欺騙的，一定要看事實。根據這一點，本席感覺慰忭，就是今天能夠知道許許多多事實，這些事實須有詳盡之研討，同時，在今天會塲裹有一個感覺，就是雙方的意思，雙方的報告，各有重點，政府要求政令軍令統一，這個不僅是政府的意思，可以說四萬五千萬人公共的意思。中共的要求是促進民主政治，這個不僅是中共的意思，而是四萬五千萬人的意思，假使立刻實施憲政，這個立刻是要有相當的時間。因爲必須經過相當的過程。同時軍政軍令的統一，也是絕對，不是很快可以做到的，中共舉出許多事實，這也是不能抹煞的。但是，我們知道中並並不是要立刻集中待命，中間有伸縮的餘地，雙方如都能拿出誠意，能夠講恕道，中共問題是不難解決的。現在彷彿看到雙方的意見距離很遠，但中共聲明決不願意破裂，願意根據和順的意思向前走。政府方面剛才張部長聲明，也說政治解決的方針決不變更，還是繼續下去，所有中間若干問題，用快刀斬亂麻，不失望也沒絕望。要知道民主政治最重要的就是忍耐，我們不是求痛快，一切要忍耐，以參政會來講，都是對於政治相當努力的。如果雙用得着，我們願意以國民地位來帮助，我想同仁一定不吝爲國家努力。]（全文完）</p>

        <h1>1944.10.09</h1>
<h3>Insincere Honesty</h3>
<p>The meaning of insincere honesty is to speak the truth and do practical things with sincerity and honesty. In modern Chinese history, the one who advocated insincere honesty the most and achieved the most effective results was Zeng Guofan. In his "Record of the Zhaozhong Shrine in Xiangxiang," he said: [When the world is in chaos, those above and below indulge in desires leading to destruction, the treacherous and deceitful devour each other, and they plot against each other, seeking their own safety while putting others in extreme danger. They fear difficulties and avoid harm, and are unwilling to contribute even a single strand of millet to save the world. Those who are loyal and honest rise up to correct this, being self-disciplined and loving others, abandoning falsehood and embracing insincere honesty. The gentlemen of our village inspired the masses and quelled the great chaos throughout the nine provinces. Is this not the effect of being insincere and honest?] This is the secret to Zeng Guofan's lifelong success. In the current society full of hypocrisy and superficiality, it is even more worthy of our admiration and emulation.</p>
<p>Speaking the truth and doing practical things is not a difficult task, but speaking the truth is most likely to offend people, and doing practical things is even more likely to be slandered. Those who speak the truth pay the most attention to right and wrong. They can never gloss over their faults, nor can they turn right into wrong. The purpose of speaking the truth lies in distinguishing between true right and wrong. There should be no room for pretense or slight trickery between right and wrong. Therefore, the more honest one speaks, the easier it is to offend people; the more honest words one speaks, the more people one offends. Secondly, doing practical things is simply to seek truth from facts and show the results of one's work. Those who do practical things do not exaggerate, do not perfunctorily perform tasks, and are not careless. In the process of doing things, they proceed with a certain purpose and move forward bravely, without any compromise or accommodation. Therefore, the more diligently one does things, the easier it is to be slandered; the more diligent tasks one does, the more people slander them. Therefore, before practicing the two words "[insincere honesty]," one must first have the courage to be fearless and the determination to sacrifice. There is only one truth in the world, and only those who speak the truth and do practical things can proclaim this truth and consolidate it.</p>
<p>China is currently in a most difficult environment. At this time and in this place, only by striving forward can we introduce new ideas, create a new situation, and revitalize the nation and the people. At this time and in this place, we need countless insincere and honest fools to work together on this career, turning back the raging waves before they rise, and supporting the collapsing building. In China's more than 5,000 years of history, the glorious words and deeds of benevolent people and people with lofty ideals are truly too numerous to count. This is the foundation of the Chinese nation's establishment. Looking at the past history and observing the present situation, we cannot help but point out the most dangerous point at present, which is that the current situation is so difficult and arduous, and the number of people who speak the truth and do practical things is really only a handful. This phenomenon is familiar to everyone and we cannot deny it, but this is China's most serious disease.</p>
<p>The causes of this disease are the responsibility of individuals, society, and the government. The lack of courage and determination of individuals is naturally the basic reason. However, even with courage and determination, if there is no help from society and cooperation from comrades, the work of a few people will inevitably be twice the effort for half the result, and they will not achieve significant results. Furthermore, the government's encouragement and maintenance are most likely to encourage the courage of the people throughout the country and arouse the determination of the people throughout the country. Individuals, society, and the government must work together to create an atmosphere of "[insincere honesty]," so that everyone dares to speak the truth and do practical things, and those who do not speak the truth or do not do practical things will naturally be eliminated. Looking at the history of the revival of various countries in the world, almost no country has achieved it without hard work and practical work. If China hopes to revive, it must first promote the "[insincere honesty]" atmosphere of hard work and practical work.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not only tell the government the truth, but also tell our allies the truth, so as to eliminate any barriers.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Urges the People to Cooperate in Striving for Victory in the Decisive Battle, Hoping that Everyone Will Work Hard in Their Respective Positions to Enhance Combat Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso recently delivered a radio address at 6:30 a.m. on the morning of the 34th Imperial Rescript Commemoration Day, calling on the people across the country to do their duty, work hard, respond to the bloody battles of the soldiers on the front lines, maintain Japan's main force position, and complete the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. The gist of his speech is recorded as follows: Although the enemy forces have suffered heavy losses, they are still actively engaged in offensive operations in the central Pacific region, and have also landed on Morotai Island via New Guinea. Their encirclement is clearly using this as a forward base, watching the Philippines, and further cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the south. In addition, they are also eyeing the northern Kuril Islands, seeking to coordinate with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and repeatedly launching large-scale air raids on Japan, in order to destroy Japan's military supply factories, and even land on Japanese soil, making it difficult for the Japanese army to continue fighting.</p>
<h3>Ensure a Proactive Position and Further Dominate the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>However, where the enemy is arrogant, there must be a gap for us to take advantage of. The enemy's supply lines expand, and the weak points of their forces increase. Conversely, the Japanese army's defense lines become more solid. This point is indeed what makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to wage war against Japan. Therefore, we should take the opportunity to destroy the enemy in one fell swoop, consolidate our proactive position, and further dominate the future battle situation. Of course, seizing the opportunity and the secret of fighting with brave soldiers all lie in the planning and strategy of the headquarters, but the results should be placed in full confidence in the brave battles of the soldiers. Although the Japanese army is so elite, without sufficient air force and other weapons, the remarkable achievements will be castles in the air and difficult to realize. Therefore, to achieve good results, we must fully supply the necessary food, a large number of aircraft, and other weapons. The important task of supplying food and weapons is borne by us.</p>
<h3>Respond to the Soldiers on the Front Lines and Achieve the Purpose of the War</h3>
<p>Recently, the domestic atmosphere has become clearer, and 100 million compatriots have been able to stand up in their workplaces to strengthen their combat power, which is truly gratifying. No matter who it is, the size of their achievements depends on the strength of their spiritual power. Guided by morality, the entire Japanese nation has the same hatred for the enemy, and will surely make the quality and quantity of combat power increase epochally. The material power that the enemy exaggerates is really not to be feared. We firmly believe that we will be able to end the upcoming decisive battle with victory. The key to victory lies in the unwavering belief of 100 million Japanese citizens who are guided by morality. Therefore, now is the time for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and others to cooperate in launching a national movement to defeat Britain and the United States. The purpose of this national movement is to make the compatriots understand the war purpose shown in this Imperial Rescript, which is to establish stability in East Asia and peace in the world, and to frustrate the ambitions of Britain and the United States to dominate East Asia.</p>
<h3>The Whole Country is of One Mind and Displays the Spirit of Morality</h3>
<p>The current battle situation has reflected that Japan's rear production has not been able to fully counter the enemy's total counterattack. In the future, the government will adopt as much as possible the various beneficial opinions held by the compatriots, so that all citizens can consciously strengthen their awareness and consolidate their efforts, and work hard in their respective positions to increase production. However, this kind of self-awareness must be put into practice, and it is not enough to simply understand the principles and have a clear mind. In short, to open up the current extraordinary situation, we must achieve success on the front line, so that the imminent decisive battle can be carried through. This depends on the brave battles and awareness of the soldiers. Our 100 million compatriots must also cultivate and train themselves as a moral nation based on thoroughly understanding the essence of the national polity. To enhance combat power, we must maintain a strong and solid belief in victory, so that its solid power can be fully exerted unconsciously, in order to win the war.</p>

<h3>Japanese Landing Operation Smashes British and American Attempts</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Japanese Army Issues Statement - Japanese Army Frontline Base, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army in Fuzhou issued the following statement on the 7th: The enemy army attempted to advance north from New Guinea, conquer the Philippines and Taiwan, and force its way to the Chinese mainland in order to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern resource zone. Conversely, the Japanese army has already occupied Wenzhou, a key point on the eastern Zhejiang coast, and then captured Fuzhou, the last remaining port of Chongqing (the Japanese army broke into Fuzhou at 8:00 a.m. on the 4th). The Japanese army here closely cooperated with the combat troops, which made this operation successful. The commander of the Chongqing army in that area was Liu Jianxu, chairman of Fujian Province, with approximately 15,000 troops including the 80th Division under the 70th Army of Chongqing, the security column, and naval forces. At that time, the Chongqing army put up an unexpectedly stubborn resistance, forcing the Japanese army's attack troops to attack them. However, the Japanese landing troops were especially careful to prevent the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the activities of enemy submarines appearing in the nearby sea, so they launched a serious attack from both the sea and the air with the naval forces. The Japanese army made thorough preparations before the operation in order to ensure complete success. However, due to bad weather, the enemy army did not appear, so the Japanese army's operations were not hindered in any way, and the landing was successful. The capture of Fuzhou has great significance in political, economic, and military aspects. For example, Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian Province, covering an area approximately one-half of Shanghai and Hong Kong, facing Japan's Taiwan, and is the second largest city in South China. It not only occupies an important position in politics and economy, but also has various military facilities, such as shipyards and naval schools, so its military importance is extremely great. The Japanese army's occupation of this area is a major blow to the Chongqing army and further shatters the US army's attempt to invade the mainland. Finally, it is stated that the Japanese army's landing operation here is to thoroughly defeat the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States, and not to be enemies with the benevolent Chinese military and civilians. They will always cooperate with each other to jointly destroy Britain and the United States, and move forward together on the road to building a new China.</p>

<h3>Lin Zuhan's Report</h3>
<p>[Gentlemen, by order of the Chairman, I am here to report on the four months of discussions that Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, and I have had with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. I feel very excited and very honored about this matter. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be adjusted reasonably and fairly, which is an important matter in the current political arena. Not only are the members of the Political Participation Council concerned, but also the people of the whole country are paying attention to it. What I want to report to the assembly today is the process of our discussions with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang over the past four months. In this negotiation process, there are roughly seven relatively important documents, and these documents are also in writing, which you can consult. In this negotiation, the Yan'an government adopted a very sincere attitude, hoping that the central government could solve all the problems, and hoping to be able to report to Chairman Chiang. Although these issues have not yet been finally resolved, we are still discussing with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in a very friendly manner, because the three main things we are discussing are to seek solutions. (1) The resolution of military and political affairs. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang believe that it is a problem to be solved, and the Communist Party also hopes to solve it, but it has not been solved so far. Although these contents cannot be reported for the time being, in short, our two sides' opinions have not yet converged. However, we should frankly tell our colleagues in the Political Participation Council that the key to the failure to solve the problem is that there are still differences in our opinions. What are the main contents of these documents? From our point of view, I think there are two points: The first point is how to fundamentally solve these problems. I believe that our country has 450 million people, which is strength, but what method should be used to unite them? It is to implement democratic politics. The implementation of democratic politics can indeed save the country from disaster. How to implement it? It has been suggested to implement the Three People's Principles for resisting Japan and building the country, and the general program issued by the Chinese Communist Party. If these three can be implemented, we can unite the people of the whole country and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang declared that there should be no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between old and young. The people of the whole country should unite and rise up to defend the country. Only in this way can our strength be strong. The second point is some of the issues requested by the Chinese Communist Party. These issues are military issues. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, we proposed hoping that the Kuomintang would do something and that we, the Chinese Communist Party, would do something. Among the main ones, it can be said that we hope that the central government will grant freedom of speech, publication, and personal freedom to the people of the whole country, and the existence of the confluence of all parties and factions. Implement local autonomy. Now the War of Resistance has been going on for eight years, and the military and political situation has naturally undergone many changes and developments. On September 22, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party issued a declaration, and Chairman Chiang issued a speech on the 23rd to solve all problems. For example, the military issue, there were 80,000 people in northern Shaanxi, and the central government approved the formation of three divisions, 45,000 people. The war requires soldiers, and now after more than seven years of War of Resistance, the army has developed, and everything has been put on the right track. The army has (475,000) people, and the armed forces of the people have 2.2 million people. Therefore, in terms of military affairs, we hope that the central government will form five armies and sixteen divisions. This is our military demand. (2) In terms of politics: many Chinese regimes have been established, such as Hebei, Eastern Shandong, and Suiyuan, a total of 15 units. These places have implemented a people's election system. These people who implement civil rights number 88 million. These places have held two public elections, and some have held one election to manage these regimes and guide civil rights. This is our requirement regarding civil administration. (3) We demand legal existence. What did the Communist Party do before? We hope that the central government can give some conveniences so that all parties and factions can exist legally, and the Communist Party also demands open and legal existence. This is relatively important. There are other issues, but they are all in the letter, so there is no need to say them one by one. This is a basic democratic politics that we discussed, and some outstanding issues of the Chinese Communist Party need to be resolved. We believe that what is important in this negotiation has been raised. The central government has a proposal. Mr. Zhang Wenbo and I said that it should be handled according to this proposal. We feel that our proposal is somewhat different from the proposal and has not yet been resolved. I think I will only raise these important points, and some minor matters are all in the letter. These distances have five divergences. Where are the divergences? For example, as I just said, the regular army led by the Chinese Communist Party has 470,000 people, and there are another 2 million militia. According to the current numbers, it can be compiled into 47 divisions. We consider the overall situation for the central government, and we did not propose it in this way. There must be a process in the middle. Zhou Enlai made this statement at the Sun Yat-sen memorial service on March 12. On the one hand, we take into account the central government's overall planning. Although 47 divisions can be compiled, it has now been decided to compile the serial numbers of 18 divisions, 6 armies. After one discussion on the left and another discussion on the right, it was said that it was still difficult. Our Chinese Communist Party reduced it to 5 armies and 16 divisions, while the central government's proposal was 4 armies and 10 divisions. These troops are all on the front battlefield, and the units are too small to be easily commanded, so we demand an increase in the numbers in the central government's proposal. After these troops are compiled, they must be used in a concentrated manner. Those that have not been compiled should be cancelled quickly. Now we are living with the thought that it is impossible not to fight, and it is very difficult to concentrate them. As for the factual existence of parties and many democratic issues, we believe they are necessary. We will give a few examples. For example, the more we promote freedom of speech and publication, this has not been achieved until this Political Participation Council. Also, the freedom of personal freedom of the people was promulgated in July. Although this method has been promulgated, it has not been implemented. For example, in the New Fourth Army incident, the arrested persons were not tried. Ye Ting was not a member of the Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party authorities wanted to protect him. Also, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Wenbin, etc., were detained in Guangdong. We hope that these people and many other political prisoners will be released at the same time. Therefore, after the method of guaranteeing personal freedom of the people is promulgated, we hope that the central government will do a few practical things. This is a more fundamental analysis. What we hope is different from the central government's proposal. We hope that this proposal can be closer to our opinions. What I just said is relatively important, and there are naturally some secondary things. For example, we talked with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Xi'an, and the two gentlemen regarded it as a preliminary opinion, and in the future, after writing a book, it will be used as a reference for the two parties. However, the central government's instructions said that the proposal was the opinion expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan, and it was also a misunderstanding of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang. We only talked about this matter for three hours and decided it. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang mentioned this matter many times, so I will explain it to you, which is also a very small difference.

<h3>Negotiations in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Speaking of our negotiations, at last year's 11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, it was resolved to solve the problem of the Chinese Communist Party through political means. The Yan'an side was very happy to hear this news and strongly agreed, because since the New Fourth Army Incident in 1940, the situation had been deadlocked. As a member of the Political Participation Council, I could not come out because of the blockade. After the 11th Plenary Session, we obtained the permission of the central government to come out, but due to the border area's agricultural movement, we did not leave Yan'an until April 29. When I arrived in Xi'an, I unexpectedly met Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang. Also, because there were no planes coming to Chongqing at that time, we began to discuss with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Xi'an on May 4, for a total of five discussions. This discussion was a preliminary exchange of opinions, and finally reported to the central government. At that time, the two gentlemen asked me what my opinions were. I said that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had also discussed the issue of negotiations. Zhou Enlai made a speech at the Sun Yat-sen memorial service in Yan'an on March 12, which can be used as the basis for negotiations. One part of it talked about democracy and constitutionalism, and the other part talked about the resolution of many outstanding issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang said that these matters would be discussed again in Chongqing, and the current focus was on military affairs. The military issues were first to reduce the size of the organization, and second to reduce the number of troops. I said that our army had more than 470,000 people, and asked how many the central government would allow to be compiled. Mr. Zhang and I had a face-to-face talk, and I said six armies and eighteen divisions. Mr. Zhang said it was too many. We talked about this matter for three days. Two years ago, Division Commander Lin Biao proposed a requirement to be compiled into four armies and twelve divisions. Mr. Zhang brought the record of the talks at that time and raised this previous requirement. I said that this point of view could be reported to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for consideration. There were also many issues involving politics, which were all in the documents. A record was made of the last discussion. The day before yesterday, Mr. Lei Zhen showed me this record, titled "[Results of Talks with Mr. Lin Zuhan]," and asked me to sign it. I said that this was the opinion of both sides, and after I revised it, I signed it. I also asked them to sign it, but the two of them said that this was not a clause and they did not need to sign it, and that they would submit it to the central government for instructions. This was the process of the preliminary negotiations. I flew to Chongqing on the 17th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received my telegram and quickly wrote 20 articles based on my telegram on the 20th. The first four articles talked about democracy, hoping that the government would immediately implement freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom. The second was to recognize the legal existence of the Chinese Communist Party, and to release political prisoners. The third was to implement local autonomy, and there were some minor issues in the back. It was sent to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on the 22nd. After reading it, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought that some of the minor issues in the back were a bit stimulating, and brought it back to me. I asked them what their opinions were. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought it should be changed to twelve articles, and the remaining eight articles were minor issues to be discussed orally. These eight minor issues seemed small, but in our opinion in Yan'an, they were still major issues. Yan'an received my things on June 3, and then came up with twelve articles. It was sent to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on June 4. Later, the central government's proposal of 18 articles was sent to Yan'an. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang expressed that they could not accept my letter. I thought that I represented the Chinese Communist Party and should send it to Chairman Chiang. I wrote a letter to the two of them on June 11, and the two of them replied that my letter had been sent to the central government. After a long time, Minister Liang said at a discussion meeting that the negotiations had stalled and that the Chinese Communist Party should come to its senses. Some newspaper reporters came to ask me, and I said that as long as it was beneficial to the War of Resistance, we could do it. Minister Liang then gave an English speech on July 26, with a total of four points, saying that part of the negotiations had been resolved and part could not be resolved, but that China would not fight a civil war. Some newspaper reporters came to ask me again. Zhou Enlai also gave a speech on August 13, saying that the Chinese Communist Party hoped to resolve this matter and hoped that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang could come to Yan'an for negotiations. I also forwarded it to them, and they thought it could be discussed. They sent me a letter back on August 10, and I replied again on August 30, for a total of seven documents. You gentlemen can understand the process of the negotiations by reading them. The meaning of my coming is that the Chinese Communist Party comrades very much want to solve this problem and are very sincere. I have been here for four months, and I am still in close contact with the two gentlemen, and the two gentlemen have also explained this matter to me, but the problem has not been solved to this day. The Chinese Communist Party hopes that the central government will solve this problem. Now the country needs us to unite, especially the unity between the various parties and factions, but it is very obvious that after four months of discussions, I must tell you that there is still some distance to go.]</p>
<h3>Opinions of Wang Yunwu and Hu Lin</h3>
<p>After listening to the report on the negotiations regarding the Chinese Communist Party issue on the morning of September 15th, Wang Yunwu and Hu Lin expressed their opinions to the assembly. Mr. Wang stated: [After listening to the reports of Councilor Lin and Minister Zhang today, I summarize them, and the most important issues are only two: one is the openness of political power, and the other is the unification of military orders. The openness of political power is proposed by the CCP. In fact, not only does the CCP advocate it, but I think the people of the whole country also advocate it, and the Kuomintang and the government have repeatedly declared their determination to return political power to the people. The unification of military orders is proposed by the government. Of course, this is not only the government's advocacy, but also the advocacy of the people of the whole country. Even the CCP agrees with it. The fourth of the CCP's four promises also clearly states that the Eighteenth Group Army is willing to be under the jurisdiction of the Military Commission and accept the command of the Military Commission. Among Commander Lin Biao's four conditions, there are also words of obedience to the central government. In the opinions put forward by the central government representatives in Xi'an, there is also this article. Now, hearing Councilor Lin's earnest and frank statement that he is determined to fulfill the four promises, that is to say, the unification of military orders is not a problem either. Today, Councilor Lin has earnestly expressed it in his speech. Under these two major principles, both sides agree on the openness of the right to participate in politics and the unification of military orders, and there is no disagreement. If we seek solutions based on these two principles, there is no problem that cannot be solved. In addition, I would like to put forward the following two points to the government: First, after listening to Minister Zhang's report just now, I feel that the government is indeed using a lenient policy to solve this problem. I personally hope that the government can be even more lenient in its leniency. Second, even if genuine constitutionalism cannot be implemented now, it can be further advanced on the road to constitutionalism. We also have two points of opinion for the CCP: Second, I agree with many of the principles in the various opinions put forward by the CCP, but my personal opinion is that I hope the CCP can have factual manifestations in practice. Minister Zhang's report just now said that the unification of military orders is a big problem. According to my statement above, this problem is really not a problem; however, we very much hope to see more factual manifestations. Second, I very much hope that after the two sides negotiate, they can untie one knot after another. Don't add another one before one is solved. Regarding the conditions, I haven't looked at these materials in detail, but I always hope that the knots won't increase.] Hu Lin said: [Councilor Lin's report this morning was very accurate. Colleagues in the Political Participation Council have been warriors in the Chinese political arena for many years. When reporting to the Political Participation Council, they must have an open and frank attitude; because theoretical propaganda is useless to the Political Participation Council. Political warriors in the Political Participation Council cannot be shaken by propaganda. Everyone has independent judgment. We are not judging, but we all have the ability to judge. Not only do our councilors have the ability to judge, but since the War of Resistance, the general public's level of knowledge has increased a lot, so the common people cannot be deceived either, and they cannot be deceived by theories and empty, nice-sounding words. They must see the facts. Based on this point, I feel gratified, that is, today we can know many, many facts. These facts must be thoroughly researched. At the same time, there is a feeling in today's meeting place, that is, the intentions of both sides, the reports of both sides, have their own focuses. The government's request is for the unification of political and military orders. This is not only the government's intention, but it can be said to be the public intention of 450 million people. The CCP's request is to promote democratic politics. This is not only the CCP's intention, but it is the intention of 450 million people. If constitutional government is implemented immediately, this "immediately" must have a considerable amount of time. Because it must go through a considerable process. At the same time, the unification of military administration and military orders is also absolute, and it cannot be achieved quickly. The CCP has cited many facts, and these cannot be erased. However, we know that the CCP does not want to concentrate and wait for orders immediately, and there is room for flexibility in the middle. If both sides can show sincerity and be forgiving, the CCP issue is not difficult to solve. Now it seems that the opinions of the two sides are far apart, but the CCP has stated that it is determined not to break down and is willing to move forward based on the intention of harmony. Minister Zhang of the government also stated just now that the policy of political resolution will never change and will continue. All the issues in the middle can be resolved quickly. Don't be disappointed, and don't be in despair. We must know that the most important thing in democratic politics is patience. We are not seeking quick results. Everything requires patience. As far as the Political Participation Council is concerned, everyone is working hard on politics. If we can be of use to both sides, we are willing to help in the capacity of citizens. I think my colleagues will definitely not hesitate to work hard for the country.] (End of full text)</p>
