<p>東京二十一日中央社電　二十一日爲日泰同盟條約締結三周年紀念日，日小磯首相及重光外相兼大東亞相，分別向泰首相阿巴溫，外相西塞那兩氏致電祝賀，（一）小磯首相賀電　當茲日泰攻守同盟締結三周年之際，兩國相互協力，信守不渝之誠意，益形緊密鞏固，余實衷心銘感，在此議表賀意。今出國國民於閣下領導下，堅定打倒英美侵略主義及擁護自主獨立信念，一致團結，向完遂戰爭之途邁進，誠令余敬佩之至。且當茲可紀念之日，余特表明日本國民與盟邦泰國國民互相提携，共同完成勝利之決意，最後謹祈日泰兩國勝利，並祝閣下健康。（二）重光外相兼大東亞相賀電　茲常日泰攻守同盟三周年之際，兩國於同盟條約規定及其根本精神下，以堅固團結及必勝信念，擊滅共同敵人而奮鬥至今，誠堪同慶。當茲可賀之日，余謹請閣下向泰國政府及泰國國民表明帝國政府及國民之賀意，並衷心祈祝泰國國運昌隆及日泰友好關係之增進</p>
<p>日首相廣播詞</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日小磯首相與泰首相阿巴溫，二十一日下午七時半作交換廣播講演，日小磯手相廣播詞大意如次：「余藉此機會，對貴國國民諸君，　求東亞復興與立於正義上之世界，永久和諸君於理解日本　　之道義意圖之同時，並能覺悟此次大東亞戰爭，係擁護貴國革命，即獨立自主之完成，不能不對英美之侵略與榨取拼死作戰之原委，以阿巴溫首相爲中心，舉國一致，以必勝氣魄，克服戰時下一切困難，完成作戰之使命。余對此實深表敬意與感謝之情，唯如諸君所素知，戰局至今益趨苛烈，已入決戰階段，日泰兩國之興廢與東亞十億民族之命運，皆鑒於今日。我等日本國民繼特別攻擊隊勇士之後，前綫與後方莫不團結一體，誓驅驕敵於東亞之外，不論於菲律賓之決戰，前綫與後方生產，皆以不屈不撓精神從事奮鬥。過去三年間，由於日軍之勇戰，同盟諸邦國民諸君之努力，已確立必勝不敗之體勢，今更集結全東亞之總力，共同爲戰勝而奮鬥，余確保吾等對作戰目的與實力，旣有自信，必能克服一切困難，而獲得最後之勝利。日泰攻守同盟條約簽訂三周年紀念之今日，余於此能再度表明日本完成戰爭之決意及披瀝日本始終支援貴國之誠意，實不　幸甚」。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日重光外相兼大東亞相，二十晚假外相官邸舉行紀念晚餐會，到泰國方面烏基特大使以次館員，日本方面德川願貞侯爵，柴山陸軍次官，眞田陸軍軍務局長，多田海軍軍務局長，澤田外務次官，竹內大東亞次官等，席間賓主分別表明完遂戰爭之決意，並作開誠懇談，迄八時許始盡歡而散。茲誌日重光外相兼大東亞相及泰國大使烏基特氏致辭要旨如次：</p>
<p>重光氏致詞</p>
<p>日泰同盟，乃建設大東亞之一重要支柱，日泰協力，則爲遂行大東亞戰爭之一大推進力，我對泰國之政策，本諸盟約，自須尊重其獨立與主權，謀泰國國民之福社，並予以支援，在此擁護泰國自主獨立，解放東亞之共同戰爭中，已完成其重要使命，乃帝國朝野所深知者，我等同盟國，若能在必勝不敗之愈勢下，愈益緊密提携，舉總力遂行戰爭，則此復興東亞之正義戰爭，最後勝利必屬吾等無疑</p>
<p>烏基特致詞</p>
<p>日泰同盟條約締結以來，三年於茲，其間兩國曾共同與敵週旋，今兩國仍在遂行偉大之任務。現下之任務，惟在爭取勝利，今日東亞各民族均已獲得獨立，脫離過去隸屬英美之苦境，敵人堅持利巴主義，在此偉大堅戰中，決不能獲致勝利，吾人刻在完全調和相互信賴之空氣中，從事戰鬥。反之，英美則在不安與懷疑之環境中苦戰，故敵早晚必至精疲力盡，而歸失敗，最近之歐洲戰局，即可證明此點。泰國國民相信，日本必能勝利，而以與日本同盟爲光榮。</p>
<h3 id="c3">敵對日本上　無大規模空襲可能　趕島大佐發表見解 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日陸軍航空本部趕島大佐茲於此間每日新聞披露一文，題爲「敵機來敵航空基地之近况及大規模來襲之不可能之情形，其意如次：以塞班島爲基地空襲日本本土之B29型機，過去係以十數機內外之小編隊作波狀攻擊，如歐洲戰塲之大舉空襲，事實上尙無一次，其目的不外使我國民於警報下延長待避時間，以使生產能力減低，亦所謂神經戰。以塞班島爲基地之敵機難以大舉空襲之原因，係基地狹小，不適於大編隊之起飛，蓋彼等欲成大編隊時，各機必須遞次自滑翔路起飛，而該地滑翔路狹小，一次僅能地滑翔路狹小，若組成大編隊時，先起飛者，必須於空中等待相當時間，致徒費多量汽油，如每小時之巡航速度四五〇公里時，等待一時則左右，　貯油罐保有之汽油將被消耗十分之一內外。又據敵方情報，前十三日空襲日本土之敵機，於歸途上曾遭遇南洋特有之暴風雨，致不得不遲延二十分種。據云於此短時間內，因燃料用盡，其中數機已被迫降落水面，由此事實，可知最近携帶炸彈來襲日本土之敵機，當被我機追逐之際，雖不惜燃料以最大速度遁逃，但結果僅能返抵塞班，其燃料已無富餘，如組成大編隊時，其燃料消耗之大，必非敵方所能應付，故普通彼等只能以一二機或每次以一中隊之編隊，向日本十進攻最近之小規模波狀攻擊，即爲此故，如能作空擊災害之準備，依過去經騐，並不足慮。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日陸軍中尉田中秀志等八紘飛行隊之十勇士，曾於十一月十七日以十架飛機猛攻停泊於雷伊泰　內之敵艦船，結果炸毁共十艘，而收獲莫大戰果，對此，當局以分別予以推昇二級，或進昇少尉。同時，南方方面日陸軍最高指揮官對此等功勳，亦分別授與感狀，且已奏呈天皇，按上項事情，業由日陸軍省於二十一日發表。</p>
<p>菲島基地二十一日中央社電　日空軍十八日晚曾於卡麥泰斯海發見敵運輪船團，即加以猛攻，結果擊毁其巡洋艦一艘及狀似中型巡洋艦者一艘。同時，是夜日潛水艇於蘇魯海東端。亦曾發見敵運輸團，而炸沉其二艘。</p>
<p>菲島基地二十一日中央社電　日空軍曾於十七日晚轟炸雷伊泰島西岸之敵登陸陣地，結果敵陣地有數處被炸毁。又十八日晚曾轟炸沉朗多羅島敵登陸地點及其附近陳地，結果炸沉敵沿岸舟艇一艘，炸毁一艘，並使敵陸上設施數處起火燃燒，此外，十九日晚復進攻明多羅島桑霍塞之敵軍軍需卸下地點，結果炸沉敵魚雷艇四艘，且令其陸上設施數處燃燒，其中有一處曾發生大火災，而燃燒數小時之久。</p>

<h3 id="c7">嚴格執行擾亂經濟罪的刑律 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>昨天本報刋載本市警察當同爲適用戰時刑事特別法，發表談話，除闡述戰時刑事特別法公布之目的以外，復對該特別法的內容，分爲政治犯，防空關係犯罪，妨害重要產業及公共事業，擾亂經濟及利敬犯罪等項，加以槪要提示。</p>
<p>按戰時刑事特別法，公布於去年五月十日。最主要之目的，在消極方面，規定重典，以期減少犯罪動機，確保戰時治安。在積極方面，從而滅絕罪行，確立戰時體制，以期人民共同努力於本位工作，恊力完遂參戰任務。</p>
<p>自從該法公布以後，歷時已一年半以上，引用該法處置的罪犯案伴，爲數極少，這一現象，我們可從兩面觀察，一面確實因爲犯罪案伴很少發生，所以沒有引用特別刑法的機會，一面因爲犯罪案件並非絕無發生，却因徇情枉法的結果，沒有加以引用。前者是好現象，後者是惡性政治病態。</p>
<p>然則，我們試加檢討，僅就擾亂經濟犯罪一點而言，僅就上海一地域而言，在這一年半中，是否沒有引用特別刑法的機會呢？還是有機會而沒有引用呢？在擾亂經濟及利敵犯罪中，第一項爲：「軍需品日常必需品之投機操縱囤積居奇，處死刑或無期徒刑。」那末，我們敢說，上海是製造謠言的總機關，是投機操縱囤積居奇的策源地，是掀起物價漲風的領導者。這些罪行，當然不是所有上海人全都如此的，而是上海一部分追求暴利的自私分子所犯着的。試想每次物價的波動，那一次不是投機份子先有囤積，繼之以造謠而掀動漲風的呢？置批追求暴利者有組織，有計劃，一小部分甚至有地位，有聲望，所以手眼通天，可以做了犯罪的事，而仍逍遙作富家翁，以萬家哭一家笑自鳴得意。</p>
<p>遠的不說，就以最近米價狂跳，引起一般物價的狂漲，也是這批暴利者的罪行，我們在三次諭列食米對策的社評中已經嚴詞指出，如果這批社會之癌，戰時經濟之癌，大東亞戰爭勝利之癌，不予剷除消滅，終有一天養鷄成患，不堪收拾的。我們沉痛的說，惟有這批暴利者到了末日，才是社會開始淸明之日，才是戰時經濟趨於正軌之日，才是大東亞戰爭勝利確保之日。上海是戰時後方重要基地，是戰時經濟主宰領導之重鎭，而確保軍需與安定民生在戰時經濟中何等需要，戰時經濟之安定在大東亞戰爭決勝階段中又何等需要，所以，　中國戰時經濟之安危的上海經濟動態，更是何等重要，決計不能任令暴利者之猖獗而永使戰時上海的經濟紊亂。</p>
<p>現在本市警察當局鄭重提示戰時刑事特別法的重要，我們很欣幸當局的用意，也可以測知當局的決心。不過，我們認爲法律成效，還在於政治健全，過去政治機構與人事，無可諱言的尙未臻於健全地步，所以，我們盼望今後法律的有效，首先健全政治，以期配合。</p>
<h3 id="c8">桂省民衆　協力日軍建設　華南日某部隊長談話 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>大陸前綫基地二十一日中央社電　日軍某部隊長此次曾直接參加華南方面作戰，日昨發表談話稱：作戰當初最感憂慮者，即爲廣西民衆之動向，然事實日軍每到之處，大受民衆歡迎，雖桂林柳州梧州南寗等抗戰中心地之民衆，依然敬慕日軍，次第歸來，蓋廣西乃由李宗仁。白崇禧等西南派之大廣西主義把持，不受渝方直接統治，故廣西之自衛，旣非爲重慶，更非爲延安，廣西民衆對渝美空軍　炸之卑鄙行爲，異常憤激。據美軍俘虜供稱：無論對日本軍隊或中國軍隊，一有行動，即加以掃射，要之，渠等眼中並無東洋人，被迫而建設西南美空軍基地犧牲於其轟炸及掃射下之民衆，對美軍此種暴　，當亦不能默默無語，反之，日軍軍紀嚴正，民衆目睹此種事實，當然興奮來歸，　此等民衆正在日本之溫情下，一致奮起，以期建設廣西之和平云。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日第八十六次議會，因於重大戰局下，而舉行政治審議法案，乃至預算外，更有其他重要問題正待審議。第一，即前義會未解決之朝鮮，台灣政治待遇問題，即對兩地之參政問題，政府之具體案，雖經於義會披露，然囂政內部之問題，因今朝鮮，台灣實施徵兵制度，然並未賦與參政權益，故　政會內多數人皆立於政治見地，而支援政府。第二，即隨戰局演進之純政治問題，亦即實行充分遂行指導菲律賓戰局之戰力增強施策，因此主張斷行更迭一部首腦人事。第三，爲政治力確立問題，刻下黨政會內正討論此問題，盛論翼政會現在雖稱爲政治團體，然並未標揭重要政綱政策，爲打破此現狀，必須進一步作爲担當時局之政治組織體，一新其面目。然於茲所成問題者，即倘取以上之形態，則將分裂爲數個政治集團，故今後方針，似仍採取　政會之單一形態，使與政治之連繫更趨緊密，而漸次担當政局之重任。</p>

<p>新京二十一日中央社電　七日渝美空軍來襲奉天大連時，曾將炸彈投於俘虜收容所內，致俘虜死傷達五十五名之多，爰於空襲警報發出時，各俘虜於所長之指揮下，另避於安全地帶，然因敵機肓目投彈，故有數彈落於收容所內，英美澳等俘虜傷亡達五十五名，因之各俘虜莫不激憤，茲一負傷之美空軍下士，對美機之盲炸談稱，不料此機來自故國，使余右肩及胸部負傷，余實未思及故國所贈者如此殘酷。又因此次之空襲，余友數人因而負傷或死亡云云。又美軍俘虜湯事基恩期少校，亦發表所感如次：此收容所乃爲俘虜而設者，故易與其他軍用建築物相區別，在此次空襲下，致有數十名死傷，爲自國之飛機，係爲國家而戰，但爲何轟炸吾人，處令人不解也。</p>
<p>谷二十一日中央社電　十二月八日敵機來襲泰國中部地區，投彈盲炸，事後調查，該地英　俘虜避難所被炸，死五十六各，受傷百四十一名。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The 21st marks the third anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty. Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu sent congratulatory telegrams to Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong and Foreign Minister Sresena, respectively.</p>
<p>(1) Prime Minister Koiso's congratulatory telegram: "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Japan-Thailand Defensive Alliance, I am deeply moved by the increasingly close and unwavering sincerity of mutual cooperation between our two countries. I hereby express my heartfelt congratulations. Today, under Your Excellency's leadership, the people of your country are firmly determined to overthrow Anglo-American aggression, uphold the belief in independence and autonomy, and unite to advance on the path to complete the war. This is truly admirable. Furthermore, on this commemorative day, I would like to express the determination of the Japanese people to cooperate with the people of our allied nation, Thailand, to jointly achieve victory. Finally, I pray for the victory of both Japan and Thailand and wish Your Excellency good health."</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu's congratulatory telegram: "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Japan-Thailand Defensive Alliance, both countries, under the provisions and fundamental spirit of the alliance treaty, have fought to this day with firm unity and a belief in certain victory to defeat our common enemy. This is truly a cause for celebration.

<p>Prime Minister of Japan's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong exchanged broadcast speeches at 7:30 PM on the 21st. The main points of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast speech are as follows: "I take this opportunity to express to all citizens of your country… Seeking the revival of East Asia and a world based on justice, may you forever understand Japan's righteous intentions and realize that this Greater East Asia War is to defend your country's revolution, that is, the completion of independence and autonomy, and that we have no choice but to fight to the death against Anglo-American aggression and exploitation. With Prime Minister Apaiwong as the center, the entire nation is united, overcoming all wartime difficulties with a spirit of certain victory, and completing the mission of war. I deeply express my respect and gratitude for this. However, as you all know, the war situation has become increasingly severe and has entered a decisive stage. The rise and fall of Japan and Thailand, and the fate of a billion people in East Asia, all depend on today. We, the Japanese people, following the example of the brave warriors of the Special Attack Forces, are united as one in the front lines and the rear, vowing to drive the arrogant enemy out of East Asia. Whether in the decisive battle in the Philippines, or in production in the front lines and the rear, we are engaged in the struggle with an indomitable spirit. Over the past three years, thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army and the efforts of the people of our allied nations, we have established a certain and invincible position. Now, we are gathering the total strength of all of East Asia to fight together for victory. I am confident that we have the confidence in our war aims and strength, and that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory. On this third anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand Defensive Alliance Treaty, I am very fortunate to be able to once again express Japan's determination to complete the war and to sincerely support your country from beginning to end."</p>

<p>Japanese Foreign Minister's Official Residence: Commemorative Dinner Party, Guests and Hosts Express Resolve for War</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu held a commemorative dinner party at his official residence on the evening of the 20th. Those attending from the Thai side included Ambassador Ukit and other members of the embassy. From the Japanese side, those attending included Marquis Tokugawa Yoshitada, Vice-Minister of the Army Shibayama, Director of the Army Affairs Bureau Sanada, Director of the Navy Affairs Bureau Tada, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada, and Vice-Minister of Greater East Asia Takeuchi. During the dinner, guests and hosts expressed their determination to complete the war and engaged in frank and sincere discussions, which ended joyfully at around 8 PM. What follows is a summary of the speeches given by Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu and Thai Ambassador Ukit:</p>
<p>Shigemitsu's Speech</p>
<p>The Japan-Thailand Alliance is an important pillar for the construction of the Greater East Asia. The cooperation between Japan and Thailand is a major driving force for carrying out the Greater East Asia War. My policy towards Thailand is based on the alliance treaty, and we must respect its independence and sovereignty, seek the welfare of the Thai people, and provide support. In this common war to uphold Thailand's independence and liberate East Asia, we have completed our important mission, which is well-known to both the Imperial Government and the public. If we, the allied nations, can cooperate even more closely with an ever-growing trend of certain victory and invincibility, and carry out the war with all our strength, then there is no doubt that the final victory in this righteous war to revive East Asia will belong to us.</p>
<p>Ukit's Speech</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the signing of the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty. During this time, both countries have fought together against the enemy, and both countries are still carrying out great tasks. The current task is only to strive for victory. Today, all the nations of East Asia have gained independence and have escaped the suffering of being affiliated with Britain and America in the past. The enemy insists on liberalism, and cannot achieve victory in this great and arduous battle. We are currently engaged in battle in an atmosphere of complete harmony and mutual trust. On the other hand, Britain and America are struggling in an environment of anxiety and doubt. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably be exhausted sooner or later and will ultimately fail. The recent situation on the European front can prove this point. The Thai people believe that Japan will surely win and are proud to be allied with Japan.</p>

<p>No Large-Scale Air Raids Possible on Mainland Japan; Colonel Keshima Expresses His Views</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Colonel Keshima of the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters published an article in the Mainichi Shimbun here entitled, "The Recent Situation of Enemy Aircraft Coming to Attack Air Bases and the Impossibility of Large-Scale Raids." The main points are as follows: "The B-29 type aircraft based on Saipan Island to bomb the Japanese mainland have been making wave-like attacks in small formations of about a dozen aircraft in the past. In fact, there has not been a single large-scale air raid like those on the European battlefield. Their purpose is nothing more than to make our people spend longer in shelters under air raid warnings, so as to reduce production capacity. It is what is called a war of nerves. The reason why it is difficult for enemy aircraft based on Saipan Island to carry out large-scale air raids is that the base is small and unsuitable for the takeoff of large formations. In order to form a large formation, each aircraft must take off one after another from the runway. However, the runway there is narrow, and only one aircraft can take off from the runway at a time. If a large formation is formed, the aircraft that take off first must wait in the air for a considerable amount of time, which wastes a lot of fuel. For example, at a cruising speed of 450 kilometers per hour, waiting for an hour or so will consume about one-tenth of the fuel stored in the fuel tanks. Also, according to enemy intelligence, the enemy aircraft that bombed the Japanese mainland on the 13th encountered a tropical storm unique to the South Seas on their way back, which forced them to delay for 20 minutes. It is said that within this short period of time, several aircraft were forced to land on the water due to fuel exhaustion. From this fact, it can be seen that the enemy aircraft that have recently brought bombs to attack the Japanese mainland, when chased by our aircraft, although they spare no fuel to escape at maximum speed, can only return to Saipan as a result, and their fuel has no surplus. If a large formation is formed, the large fuel consumption will certainly be beyond the enemy's capacity to cope with. Therefore, normally, they can only attack Japan in formations of one or two aircraft, or one squadron at a time. The recent small-scale wave-like attacks are for this reason. If preparations for air raid disasters can be made, according to past experience, there is nothing to worry about."</p>

<h3 id="e7">嚴格執行擾亂經濟罪的刑律 <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Enforce the Criminal Law for the Crime of Disrupting the Economy</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a conversation with the local police, using the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. In addition to elaborating on the purpose of the promulgation of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime, it also provided a brief overview of the content of the special law, divided into political crimes, crimes related to air defense, crimes hindering important industries and public undertakings, crimes disrupting the economy, and crimes of profiting from the enemy.</p>
<p>The Special Criminal Law for Wartime was promulgated on May 10th of last year. The main purpose is, in a passive sense, to prescribe severe penalties in order to reduce the motivation for crime and ensure wartime security. In a positive sense, it is to eradicate crimes and establish a wartime system, so that the people can work together in their respective positions and cooperate in completing the task of participating in the war.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of this law, more than a year and a half have passed, and the number of criminal cases handled by citing this law is extremely small. We can observe this phenomenon from two perspectives. On the one hand, it is indeed because there are very few criminal cases, so there is no opportunity to cite the special criminal law. On the other hand, it is because criminal cases are not completely non-existent, but because of the result of favoritism and perversion of the law, it has not been cited. The former is a good phenomenon, and the latter is a malignant political disease.</p>
<p>However, let us try to examine it. Just taking the crime of disrupting the economy as an example, just taking the Shanghai region as an example, in this year and a half, has there been no opportunity to cite the special criminal law? Or has there been an opportunity but it has not been cited? Among the crimes of disrupting the economy and profiting from the enemy, the first item is: "Speculating, manipulating, hoarding, and profiteering in military supplies and daily necessities shall be punishable by death or life imprisonment." Then, we dare to say that Shanghai is the general mechanism for manufacturing rumors, the source of speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, and the leader in triggering rising prices. Of course, these crimes are not committed by all the people of Shanghai, but by a selfish group of Shanghai people who pursue exorbitant profits. Think about it, every time prices fluctuate, which time is it not that speculators first hoard goods, and then stir up rising prices by spreading rumors? This group of people who pursue exorbitant profits is organized and planned, and a small part even has status and prestige, so they have connections everywhere, and can commit crimes while still living a comfortable life as wealthy people, taking pride in making the majority weep while a few laugh.</p>
<p>Not to mention the distant past, just taking the recent skyrocketing of rice prices, which has triggered a general rise in prices, is also the crime of this group of profiteers. We have pointed out in stern terms in the three editorials on rice countermeasures that if this cancer of society, this cancer of the wartime economy, this cancer of the victory of the Greater East Asia War, is not eradicated and eliminated, one day the problem will become so great that it will be difficult to deal with. We say with deep sorrow that only when this group of profiteers reaches its doomsday will the day when society begins to be clear, the day when the wartime economy begins to get on the right track, and the day when the victory of the Greater East Asia War is ensured. Shanghai is an important base in the rear during wartime, and a major stronghold that dominates and leads the wartime economy. How important it is to ensure military supplies and stabilize people's livelihood in the wartime economy. How important is the stability of the wartime economy in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War? Therefore, the economic dynamics of Shanghai, which are related to the safety of the Chinese wartime economy, are even more important. It must not be allowed to let the rampant profiteers forever disrupt Shanghai's economy during wartime.</p>
<p>Now, the local police authorities in this city solemnly emphasize the importance of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. We are very pleased with the authorities' intention and can also understand the authorities' determination. However, we believe that the effectiveness of the law still lies in the soundness of politics. It cannot be denied that the political institutions and personnel of the past have not yet reached the stage of soundness. Therefore, we hope that for the effectiveness of the law in the future, we should first improve politics in order to cooperate.</p>

<p>Guangxi People Cooperate with Japanese Army Construction; Talk by a Unit Commander of the Japanese Army in South China</p>
<p>Continental Front Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - A certain unit commander of the Japanese army, who directly participated in the South China operations this time, gave a talk yesterday, saying: "The most worrying thing at the beginning of the operation was the trend of the people of Guangxi. However, in fact, wherever the Japanese army went, it was greatly welcomed by the people. Even the people in the anti-Japanese centers such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning still admired the Japanese army and gradually returned. This is because Guangxi is controlled by the Greater Guangxi faction of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc., and is not directly ruled by Chongqing. Therefore, Guangxi's self-defense is neither for Chongqing nor for Yan'an. The people of Guangxi are extremely angry at the despicable behavior of the Chongqing-US air force bombing. According to the confession of American prisoners of war, they would strafe as soon as there was any movement by the Japanese or Chinese armies. In short, there are no Orientals in their eyes. The people who were forced to build the Southwest US air force base and sacrificed in its bombing and strafing cannot remain silent about this American atrocity. On the other hand, the Japanese army has strict military discipline. The people, witnessing this fact, are of course excited to return. These people are now rising up together under Japan's warmth in order to build peace in Guangxi."</p>

<p>Japanese Diet to Deliberate on the Issue of Political Participation for Taiwan and Korea</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The 86th Japanese Diet is holding political deliberations on bills under the serious war situation. In addition to the budget, there are other important issues to be deliberated. First, there is the issue of political treatment for Korea and Taiwan that was not resolved in the previous Diet, that is, the issue of political participation in the two regions. Although the government's specific plan has been disclosed in the Diet, the internal problem of the political arena is that Korea and Taiwan are now implementing a conscription system, but they have not been given political rights. Therefore, most people in the political arena support the government from a political standpoint. Second, there is the purely political issue that follows the evolution of the war situation, that is, the implementation of measures to strengthen combat power to fully guide the Philippine war situation. Therefore, they advocate decisively changing some of the top personnel. Third, there is the issue of establishing political power. This issue is currently being discussed in the party-political arena. There is much talk that although the Political Association is now called a political group, it has not advocated important political programs and policies. In order to break this situation, it must further become a political organization that can take charge of the current situation and start with a new face. However, the problem that arises here is that if the above form is taken, it will be divided into several political groups. Therefore, the future policy seems to be to still adopt the single form of the Political Association, make the connection with politics closer, and gradually assume the heavy responsibility of the political situation.</p>

<p>Air Raids on Fengtian and Thailand Bomb Prisoner-of-War Camps</p>
<p>More Than 200 Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Xinjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - When the Chongqing-US air force attacked Fengtian and Dalian on the 7th, they dropped bombs on the prisoner-of-war camp, causing as many as 55 prisoners of war to be killed or injured. Therefore, when the air raid alarm was issued, the prisoners of war were evacuated to a safe zone under the command of the warden. However, because the enemy aircraft dropped bombs indiscriminately, several bombs fell on the camp, killing or injuring as many as 55 British, American, and Australian prisoners of war. As a result, the prisoners of war were all indignant. An injured American air force sergeant said about the indiscriminate bombing by American aircraft, "I didn't expect this aircraft to come from my home country and injure my right shoulder and chest. I really didn't think that what my home country would give me would be so cruel. Also, several of my friends were injured or killed in this air raid." Also, Major Thompson Geenke of the US Army, a prisoner of war, also expressed his feelings as follows: "This camp is set up for prisoners of war, so it is easy to distinguish it from other military buildings. In this air raid, dozens of people were killed or injured. The aircraft were from my own country and fought for the country, but why did they bomb us? It is puzzling."</p>
<p>Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - On December 8th, enemy aircraft attacked the central region of Thailand and dropped bombs indiscriminately. After investigation, the evacuation shelter for British prisoners of war was bombed, killing 56 people and injuring 141.</p>

<p>Authorities Urge Smokers to Quit Smoking Quickly</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the government implemented the anti-smoking policy in April of this year, the results have been exceptionally good, and the expected effects have been achieved. However, many smokers in various places clearly understand the government's anti-smoking policy and have voluntarily quit. However, there are also smokers who not only do not voluntarily quit, but also avoid being transferred by the anti-smoking bureau, which violates the government's ban and the intent of the anti-smoking policy. Therefore, it is hoped that smokers in various places can encourage themselves to quit at local anti-smoking hospitals. Otherwise, those who have not quit opium after the expiration of the anti-smoking plan will be severely punished according to the law. It is hoped that smokers will not play with fire and harm themselves.</p>

<p>National Textbooks Implement Custody System</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - In view of the current shortage of paper materials and printing difficulties, the Ministry of Education has decided to implement a "National Textbook Use and Custody System" from the end of the current semester, instructing all primary and secondary schools across the country to collect all textbooks purchased by students at all levels. As for how students should use textbooks during the holidays for revision, and how to pay for the textbooks, these are detailed in the measures. At the same time, according to the person in charge of the Ministry, in addition to the fact that the China United Publishing Company is doing its best to rush to produce the textbooks for the coming spring semester, the number of textbooks will be increased as much as possible in the future to ensure that primary and secondary school students each have all the textbooks they can read under the difficult conditions of paper and printing.</p>

<p>Hitler Commands Counter-Offensive, Overcomes Crisis of This Year; German Tanks and Infantry Continue to Advance</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced the German offensive on the Western Front on the 20th as follows: The German offensive on the Western Front is an operational plan personally planned by the Führer Hitler, and the Führer also directly serves as the commander-in-chief. He has cut the US First Army into two parts. The US Army is now mobilizing more than two divisions of reserves to change the situation. The German army is fully prepared under the command of the Führer Hitler, so the German offensive will not be weakened by this.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: The German army has overcome this year's crisis with great strength and tenacity, and there seems to be no danger at present. The German army has not only maintained its front lines, but also its scientists and industrialists have supplied the German army with many new weapons. The ground forces of the anti-Axis forces no longer have the advantage to defeat the German army. The day of the end of the war still seems to be far away.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to the German official war report, as a result of the German offensive, the number of prisoners of war captured by the German army has exceeded 10,000. On Wednesday, the German army seized 43 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and 50 heavy artillery pieces, and destroyed 136 enemy tanks. In the focus of the battles on the Western Front, the enemy continued to carry out ineffective offensives with weak forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: Well-informed sources revealed that more than 100 hours have passed since the German army began its offensive in front of the Eiffel Mountains and fought the US Army. The German army has superb weapons. Before the German soldiers arrived at the front lines, they passed through German towns and villages that were bombed and destroyed in western Germany. They were exceptionally motivated and eager to fight the enemy army that indiscriminately bombed German civilians.</p>
<p>German Army Has Crossed Luxembourg</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: A German spokesman declared on Thursday that the German army on the Western Front, after annihilating and capturing US troops behind the Hechelscheid-Eifel Mountains, continued to advance forward. Most of the battles are currently being fought in Belgium. The German army has invaded the Ardennes (on the border between northern France and Belgium) and has crossed Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to a Reuters reporter in Paris, German mechanized units and infantry have made a wedge-shaped incursion into important cities within Luxembourg within 52 hours of the launch of the general offensive. So far, there has been no news of them being stopped. The German army may make further progress. The generals of the anti-Axis forces are currently devising countermeasures to the war situation, but the bad weather prevents them from obtaining strong air support. The German army seems to have achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Eisenhower Hastily Transfers Reinforcements</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: Eisenhower is still looking for the center of gravity of the German offensive, but it can be seen from the chaotic reports he has issued that he has completely failed. This surprising factor will be more conducive to German operations. Eisenhower has now hastily transferred a large number of operational reserves to deal with the German offensive. Whether he can transfer them to the area where the German pressure is greatest is still in doubt. The actions of the German army will surely be able to quickly change the center of gravity of its offensive and make it difficult for the enemy army to grasp it. Although the anti-Axis forces can use their strong air force to take the defensive, it is difficult to say whether Eisenhower can stop his offensive in the southern and northern sectors and gradually concentrate his forces to repel the German advance. However, the German offensive has not yet developed to its peak, and the final battle is imminent. After the first phase of the offensive, the second phase will follow. The German army, from top to bottom, is now determined to hold on to this initiative.</p>

<p>This committee was initially named the Cotton Control Committee and was established on November 27th of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943].

Each section establishes offices as needed for its affairs. In addition, offices are established in various regions to handle cotton control affairs in those regions under the committee's command. Regarding the business aspects, the cotton portion is currently handled by the Cotton Purchasing Industry Association, while the cotton yarn and cloth portion is handled by a separately organized Temporary Management Committee for Cotton Yarn and Cloth.

In major cotton-producing areas such as Shanghai, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Dongtai, Wuxi, Taicang, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Anqing, the committee has established cotton public warehouses, entrusted to the association for management.</p>
<p>The Temporary Management Committee for Cotton Yarn and Cloth specializes in handling the closing of cotton yarn and cloth purchasing affairs. It is purely an internal committee organization. Eight members are appointed from Chinese and Japanese cotton textile operators. It has a secretariat with one chief secretary and one deputy chief secretary, who, under the direction of the chairman and standing committee members, manage confidential matters and supervise the various sections in handling various affairs.

<h3 id="e31">New Year's Gifts from All Sectors: Please Convert to Cash and Allocate to Scholarship Fund <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Today is the "Winter Solstice," the day after tomorrow is "Christmas," and in another eight days it will be the "Gregorian New Year." These ten days are filled with consecutive festivals. According to Shanghai customs, relatives and friends will inevitably exchange gifts. But what kind of gifts should one prepare? Nothing more than food, things to use, clothes to wear, and things to play with. But haven't you thought about it: the person receiving the gift may not lack food or clothing. Sending it may not be to their liking or bring them joy. It would be better to turn this difficult problem into a very meaningful good deed: donating to the "scholarship fund." For example, if you plan to give a gift worth 20,000 yuan, you can write down the names of the recipients, form a team, and send them a formal receipt. Publish it in the newspaper the next day, as if this selfish gift has been made public to society. Transforming private into public, the recipient enjoys the fame of supporting education, and the giver invisibly sows a solid seed that will bloom into beautiful flowers and bear solid fruit in the future. Wouldn't that be a win-win situation for fame and fortune? Whether you are an individual or an organization, you can follow this method when giving gifts. Even if the gift has already been given and must be reciprocated, you can estimate its value and send the cash to this office, forming a team for the recipient. How generous and wonderful! I think if this can be promoted widely, the effect will definitely be great. On a small scale, it will change social customs; on a large scale, it will lay the foundation for national education. Isn't it worthy of advocacy?</p>
<p>Move Entertainment Expenses to Support Scholarship</p>
<p>A letter from Pei Zhengyong, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, states: "To whom it may concern: Earlier this month, the Wuyuan Qianzhuang and Xingye Real Estate Construction Company opened one after the other. Zhengyong participated in both occasions and, at the request of Mr. Huang Yu, saved entertainment expenses of 50,000 foreign currency each, which are being transferred to your newspaper's scholarship fund and the News Daily loan scholarship fund, in response to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's commendable move to transfer gifts to charity. Now, 50,000 national currency is being sent. Please accept 25,000 yuan each in the names of the 'Wuyuan Qianzhuang Saving Entertainment Expenses Team' and the 'Xingye Real Estate Construction Company Saving Entertainment Expenses Team' as special fundraising teams for your newspaper's scholarship fund. I earnestly request your acceptance."</p>
<p>Also, a letter from Mr. Pan Yangxuan states: "Respectfully, yesterday marked the tenth anniversary of my late father, Bo Shen's, passing. In these difficult and chaotic times, we only held a memorial service. Following my mother's wishes, we are donating 20,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund as the 'Bo Shen Tenth Anniversary Memorial Team,' hoping to offer a drop in the ocean of help. I respectfully request your acceptance."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Scholarship Collection: The cash conversion of the flower baskets presented to Miss Hu Qiao by various sectors at the Jingwu Sports Association's winter rehearsal totaled 18,000 yuan (including 10,000 yuan from the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, 2,000 yuan each from Jin Fushen, Cheng Weimin, and Shen Dunhui, and 1,000 yuan each from Shi Songqing and Shi Hongmin). 10,000 yuan from He Zhongyi, 5,000 yuan each from Qi Changtang and Zhu Deji, 4,500 yuan from 51 students and teachers from Mingji, 4,200 yuan from Yao Ji, 3,000 yuan from He Ji Ji, and 1,100 yuan from Liu Changsheng, a fourth-grade student from the Mingde Girls' Middle School Affiliated Elementary School, who found lost money (the school gave him a certificate of commendation to encourage him). A total of 50,800 storage coupons were collected, with a balance of 6,957,873 yuan.</p>
