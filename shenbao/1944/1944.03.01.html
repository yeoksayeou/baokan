<h3>滿洲國建設概況</h3>
<p>今天是滿洲國建國紀念日，自從民國三十一年十二月八日，滿洲國潑表「基天國策大　」以後，不久，更决定政治·民生·經濟各方面的緊魚方策，全國一致，循旣定方策邁進，頗具成績。今日欣逢建國紀念之日，介紹大東亞戰學以後之建設概况於下：</p>
<p>實施行政機構改革</p>
<p>關於滿洲國國內熊勢的概况，第一項可以提出來的，便是去年四月一日的中央行政機構改革（新設文敎部。軍事部·警務總局），此為前述基本國策大綱的實踐。其後更實施各方面行政改革，就是十月一日實施的東滿及蒙古地帶的行政機構改革·</p>
<p>即在東滿總括牡丹江·東安·間島三省，由東滿總省長管轄，於牡丹江市　東滿總省公辦，牡丹江省由總省長直轄，間島省及實安省則各　省長。此系根據丹江爲中心，而强化三省綜合的特殊行政。</p>
<p>至於蒙地行政，從來區劃為興安四省（束·西·南·北）現爲圖合運營，新設興安總省，置總省公署於興安　（　工爺廟街），强力指專蒙古，僅興安北省特別任命省長，其餘悉由總省長直轄，廢止從來的省公署，另應必要設置地區行署·同時，中央的對興安行政機構也隨之改編。强化滿洲東西二方面的特別地帶的行政至此乃吿買現。</p>
<p>電化工業的急速勃興</p>
<p>在產業部門，煤·鐵以至油頁岩。圭·　等戰時必須賣材的生產，均漸次增加，而豐當的森林實源也於去年開始大規　的採伐·木造船的建造亦漸推進。總之，滿洲國今日正舉其各部能力，向完遂戰爭遇進。過去為煤·鐵等原料生產地，處於單純的工業形態的國洲滿，今日由於動員其豐富的雷力賣源，電化工業迅速勃興，　生產者着躍通，正從原始的原料產地成長為折代工業國。此點殊堪注目。</p>
<p>大同二年（民國二十一年）發表的經濟建設要　，决定了滿洲國的統制方針，規定了獨得的特殊公司制度，但由前述基本國策藥綱加以顯著而緩和的改訂，特殊公司限於高度要求國家參　的事業；又對一業一社主義，除企棄本質上必須如此者以外，亦不予以適用。如是，滿洲經濟正遂漸從其特殊形熊蛻化。更因時局的要求，改正從來的國境觀念，舉滿洲的資源開放於增强親邦日本的戰力，决定日滿一體的資源戰時緊急動員的大方針，所以今後產業開發可望更進一步的飛圖發展。</p>
<p>為開發滿洲國的先　而有三十　年展史的滿鐵，由去年五月一日的職制大改革，其中櫃移駐新京，實行改良機能，對於滿洲國的發展當有很大的影響。滿鐵不今立於以滿洲為中戰的大陸一貫交通的主管的立塲，並且擁有多年培義的人材重工業方面所具的實力，以及各種產業文化方面所寄托的調查研究部面，在滿洲所佔的地位極其重要。由於滿鐵首腦部的移駐新京，今後可興軍及政府保持密切的連絡，舉其全部機能，活用於積極的開發，其意養着實重大。</p>
<p>總國以來業已完成政治革新的滿洲國，　　的根本問題厥爲社會掌新，因習的舊社會是　梗理想國家建設途上的障礙，如不打破，如不革新，表現建圖精神的理想國家建設便難完成。（節譯東京朝日新開）</p>

<h3>Burmese-Japanese Forces Achieve Battle Results, Preparing for Next Stage of Operations; The Annihilation Battle at Sinzewa Concludes After Encirclement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 29th at 5:00 PM: Since February 9th, Imperial Japanese forces in Burma, near the Sinzewa heights northwest of Buthidaung, have been attacking the main force of the British/Indian 7th Division. As of February 24th, most of the enemy forces have been annihilated. The mopping-up operations of the remaining enemy troops are currently underway, and thorough preparations for the next stage of operations are being made. The Indian National Army is also assisting the Japanese army and has achieved significant battle results.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The elite Japanese forces are currently tightening the encirclement line around approximately 5,000 troops of the British 7th Division's main force, who are putting up a desperate last stand on the Sinzewa heights. From midnight on the 26th, fierce attacks commenced. The commander of a certain Japanese unit took the lead, leading his soldiers in a heroic hand-to-hand combat battle against the enemy, who possessed six units of weaponry. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese forces advanced to Height 129 and the heights south of NGA KYAW DOK. Another Japanese unit advanced to the enemy's left flank and annihilated three enemy battalions south of Sinzewa, and then proceeded south. In addition, a mopping-up operation has begun against the remaining enemy forces on the western heights of Buthidaung. Thus, the encirclement and annihilation battle of the British 7th Division, centered on the Sinzewa heights, has lasted for two weeks and has now come to an end. Mopping-up operations are currently being carried out. The re-enactment of the Arakan tragedy was anticipated by us, and the enemy's long-rumored attempt to counterattack Burma from the Buthidaung front has been completely thwarted.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to dispatches from New Delhi, the commander of the South East Asia forces announced the following regarding the situation in the India-Burma theater on the 28th: The main battlefront in Arakan was extremely calm on the 27th. Japanese forces attacked the hilly area north of the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road on the night of the 26th. On the central front, a large unit of Japanese forces attacked anti-Axis positions in the Chin Hills area on the 17th. After intense localized fighting, a portion of the anti-Axis forces retreated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burma front, the British 7th Division has been defeated by Japanese forces on the India-Burma front, re-enacting its Arakan tragedy. The biggest reason for this is due to the Japanese army's strict and skillful encirclement tactics. Not only was the British 7th Division surrounded by Japanese ground forces, but it was also tightly locked down by the Japanese army. With close cooperation between the Japanese air and ground forces on the Arakan front, the encirclement of the British 7th Division was completed from dawn on the 4th. However, the British army still attempted to counterattack, hoping to reverse its bad luck. Using the Kyauktaw airport and the Cox's Bazar airport group near that line as bases, various types of fighter planes and bombers carried out operations daily. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, and fierce air battles unfolded repeatedly. From the 4th to the 13th, a total of 48 enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>

<h3>Eleven Enemy Torpedo Boats Sunk and Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific states: On the night of the 26th, a Japanese naval air squadron sighted one (torpedo boat) on the sea off Moresby. The rest escaped. Twenty-seven escaped.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 25th at approximately 8:00 PM, a Japanese army small boat unit encountered 38 enemy aircraft and over ten torpedo boats off the west coast of Bougainville Island. Fierce fighting immediately broke out, and five enemy torpedo boats were sunk and two were destroyed. The Japanese garrison near the coast in that area also cooperated in the battle, sinking one enemy torpedo boat, for a total of eight enemy torpedo boats sunk and destroyed.

<h3>Overview of Manchukuo Construction</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. Since December 8, 1942, when Manchukuo issued the "Outline of Basic National Policies," it soon decided on urgent measures in political, economic, and livelihood aspects. The whole country is moving forward in accordance with the established policies, and has achieved quite good results. On the occasion of the anniversary of the founding of the country, the following is an introduction to the construction situation since the start of the Greater East Asia War:</p>
<p>Implementing Administrative Reform</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation of the Manchurian domestic trend, the first thing that can be put forward is the reform of the central administrative organization on April 1 of last year (newly established Ministry of Education and Culture, Military Department, Police General Bureau), which is the practice of the aforementioned Basic National Policy Outline. After that, administrative reforms were implemented in all aspects, that is, the administrative organization reform in the East Manchuria and Mongolian areas implemented on October 1.</p>
<p>That is, Dongman governs the three provinces of Mudanjiang, Dong'an, and Jianji, under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Dongman Province, and the Dongman General Province Office is located in Mudanjiang City. Mudanjiang Province is directly under the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of the Province, while Jianji Province and Shi'an Province each have a governor. This is based on Danjiang as the center, and strengthens the comprehensive special administration of the three provinces.</p>
<p>As for the Mongolian administration, which has always been divided into the four provinces of Xing'an (East, West, South, and North), it is now under unified operation. The newly established Xing'an General Province is located at Xing'an (Kouwaiyemiao Street), vigorously guiding Mongolia. Only the Governor of Xing'an North Province is specially appointed, and the rest are directly under the Governor-General of the Province. The original provincial offices are abolished, and regional administrative offices are set up as necessary. At the same time, the central administrative organization for Xing'an was also reorganized accordingly. The strengthening of the administration of the special areas in the east and west of Manchuria has now been realized.</p>
<p>Rapid Rise of the Electrification Industry</p>
<p>In the industrial sector, the production of coal, iron, oil shale, silica, tungsten, and other wartime necessities has gradually increased, and the abundant forest resources also began large-scale harvesting last year. The construction of wooden ships is also gradually being promoted. In short, Manchukuo is today exerting its various capabilities to advance the war. Manchukuo, which used to be a raw material production base for coal, iron, etc., and was in a simple industrial form, is now rapidly rising in the electrification industry due to the mobilization of its abundant thunder power resources. The producers are leaping to pass, and it is growing from a primitive raw material production base to a generational industrial country. This point is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>The Economic Construction Essentials published in the second year of Datong (1932) determined Manchukuo's control policy and stipulated a unique special company system. However, it was significantly and moderately revised by the aforementioned Basic National Policy Outline. Special companies are limited to businesses that highly require national participation. In addition, the one-industry, one-company principle will not be applied except for those that are inherently required. In this way, the Manchurian economy is gradually transitioning from its special form. Furthermore, due to the needs of the times, the traditional national border concept was corrected, and Manchuria's resources were opened up to enhance the war power of its ally Japan. The major policy of emergency resource mobilization during the war of Japan and Manchuria as one was decided, so the industrial development is expected to further develop rapidly in the future.</p>
<p>The Mantetsu, which has a thirty-year history of developing Manchukuo's pioneers, underwent a major reform of its staffing system on May 1 of last year. Among them, the relocation of the counter to Xinjing and the implementation of improved functions will have a great impact on the development of Manchukuo. Mantetsu not only stands in a position of managing the land-based consistent transportation of the continent with Manchuria as its center, but also has the strength accumulated by the people nurtured over the years in the heavy industry, and the investigation and research department entrusted to various industrial and cultural aspects. Its status in Manchuria is extremely important. Due to the relocation of Mantetsu's senior management to Xinjing, it will be able to maintain close contact with the army and the government in the future, and will be able to use all its functions and actively develop it, which is extremely important.</p>
<p>Manchukuo, which has already completed political reforms since its founding, is now facing a fundamental problem: social reform. The old society of habits is an obstacle on the road to building an ideal country. If it is not broken, if it is not reformed, it will be difficult to complete the construction of an ideal country that expresses the spirit of construction. (Excerpt from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) Since the French Concession was taken over, the iron gates at the junctions of the southern city have not been opened universally to this day, which is hindering the restoration of the entire southern city area. The authorities have now decided to open them universally starting on the 10th of this month. After several discussions, it has been approved by the Municipal Government. Therefore, the prosperous situation of all industries in the southern city area will achieve significant progress in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting of the Second Police Bureau</p>
<p>The Second Police Bureau held a meeting in the conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon by the Inspection Department of the Bureau and the first and second sections to discuss the police force deployment issues after the universal opening of the iron gates in the southern city area. After careful consultation by Mr. Guo Shaoyi, the director of the Inspection Department of the Bureau, an agreement has been reached and can be decided after further consultation with the First Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Removal of Obstacles Started Yesterday</p>
<p>It has been seven years since the iron gates in the southern city were closed. Later, in order to actively restore the city appearance of the southern city, the authorities opened Nanyang Bridge, Xie Bridge, Old North Gate, Xinqiao Street, and Shiliupu successively. The iron gates in other places such as Heping Road, Tangjiawan Small Vegetable Market, and Xinbeimen, Xinkaihe, Xiaobeimen, and Xiaodongmen have not yet been opened. Since it has been decided to open them, cleaners have been engaged in sorting out and removing them separately since yesterday. After each of the iron gates is opened, the less important iron gates will still be temporarily closed at night to ensure the consolidation of public security.</p>
<h3>64th Period of Rice Flour to be Sold Starting Tomorrow; Distribution of Ration Cards for the Former Eighth District is Underway</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The first district will allocate food according to the number of people. It is now scheduled to sell rice and flour from March 2nd to 13th of this year by various retail rice shops and rice warehouses in the first district, with the 64th rice purchase coupon and the same number of flour purchase coupon respectively. Retail rice shops should sell two liters of white rice or brown rice for 23 yuan (national currency) when receiving each rice purchase coupon marked with the store number, and should sell one catty of first-class flour for 11 yuan (national currency) when receiving each flour purchase coupon marked with the store number. In addition, all retail rice shops and rice warehouses in this office will be temporarily closed for one day on March 10th.</p>
<p>The New Merger Area in Shanghai West Will Be Handled the Same Way</p>
<p>The new merger area in Shanghai West will also be handled in the same way. The names and locations of the retail rice shops in the Shanghai West area can be inquired at any designated rice shop in the area. As for other districts, the new selling price will be implemented starting from the 35th period under the supervision of the Municipal Grain Bureau. The Municipal Grain Bureau officially announced this yesterday. In addition, the First District Public Office has slightly extended the distribution period for the 64th period of household rice because the distribution of ration coupons to residents in the former Eighth District has not been completed. We hope that the citizens understand this. As for the various coupon distribution offices in the former Eighth District, they are still handling the affairs of issuing certificates as usual. Residents of the district can go to claim them as usual.</p>
<h3>Business Registration and License Renewal Allowed to be Extended for One Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau announced yesterday that the registration and license renewal for Chinese and Western medicine merchants, restaurants, and factories has been extended for one month. According to the regulations of this city, Chinese and Western medicine merchants, restaurants, manufacturing plants, public bathhouses, and barber shops in this city should apply to the Health Bureau for registration and license renewal every year in order to implement management. The registration and license renewal for this year started on February 1st and ended at the end of February. Because the Chinese Medicine Industry Association reported that after the Lunar New Year, either the store owners returned to their hometowns, or it was inconvenient to travel back and forth, and they could not complete the procedures on time, they requested the Health Bureau to postpone it for one month. Director Yuan, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants, approved a uniform extension to the end of March, and no further extension will be granted at the expiration.</p>
<p>The Trackless Trolley Abolishes Grades; All Front and Rear Carriages are First Class</p>
<p>The trackless trolley of the Shanghai Tram Company under military management will abolish all grades from today onwards, and all carriages in the front and rear will be first class. The fare is one yuan as usual, regardless of the distance. Those who hold third-class monthly tickets will not be able to use them on trackless trolleys in the future and must purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations. According to the Shanghai Tram Company, the purpose of abolishing the grading system for trackless trolleys this time is to increase transportation efficiency.</p>
<h3>Ninth Press Conference Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Municipal Propaganda Office convened the ninth press conference at the Municipal Government Auditorium yesterday. The questions raised by reporters from various newspapers and the answers from various agencies are listed below:</p>
<p>Ping Bao asked: "The public transportation tools in this city have been lacking for a long time, and the passengers are crowded day by day. The trams in the First and Eighth Districts were originally connected, but now they each stop at the old jurisdiction. In the minds of the citizens, the impression of the old boundaries remains. Why does the Municipal Government not correct this and thoroughly adjust it?"</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau replied: "The Municipal Government is handling the supervision and management of the tramways of the French Concession. As for the trams in the First District, because they are managed by electricity, the Bureau is still in contact."</p>
<p>Xinwen Bao asked: "Since the French Concession Water and Electricity Company implemented the power saving measures last winter, it has also added restrictions and quotas on tap water. The punishment measures include fines and water cuts. Water cuts have an impact on people's hygiene, drinking water, fire protection, and air defense. It is customary to use one water meter for many households. The good residents have already been extremely frugal, while cunning people still waste water at any time. As a result, the good people will suffer the same punishment and water cuts. Has the French Concession Water and Electricity Company improved its measures?"</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau replied: "The method of using water and electricity is handled according to the method used by the residents of the Eighth District. To put it simply, first distinguish between those who have a separate water meter and those who share it with the street. When the individual exceeds the quota, the fine is borne by the person who installed the water meter separately. The people on the same street bear the burden according to the number of households in the whole street."</p>
<p>Zhonghua Daily News asked: "Citizens who bought the third phase of coal briquette ration cards have not yet received them. When can they be issued? It was originally scheduled to ration two phases every month. According to the current situation, can it be implemented on time?"</p>
<p>The Economic Bureau replied: "The third phase of coal briquette ration in the first district will be sold before March 5th. The first phase ration of this bureau can also be implemented at the same time."</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Carry Their Citizen's Certificates When Entering and Exiting; the Municipal Police Authorities</h3>
<p>In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from hiding in the city and to ensure public security, spot checks and interrogations of pedestrians will be carried out from now on. The general public should fully assist the authorities in completing the task and carry their citizen's certificates with them when entering and exiting to prove their identity.</p>
<h3>Economic Crimes Prosecuted by the Special High Section Economic Division of the First Police Bureau; Gold Speculators Arrested and Under Investigation</h3>
<p>The Economic Division of the Special High Section of the First Police Bureau, established in August of last year, aims to establish an ideal economic police force to resolve the current economic crises. The division's personnel administration emphasizes high moral character, integrity, and impartiality; it cultivates economic knowledge, prepares to investigate economic matters, studies economic laws and regulations, and trains in judicial affairs as its sole purpose. Since last year, based on the above objectives, it has been engaged in the investigation of various economic crimes and has achieved some results. In particular, the previous prosecution of speculative gold trading was a wake-up call for general speculators and manipulators. Before implementing each measure, a thorough investigation is conducted, followed by arrests. Depending on the severity of the circumstances, bail is granted or detention is imposed. Currently, seventeen people are still under interrogation. It is understood that the date of arrest for these offenders was February 10th at 10:00 AM, at the following locations: Yongxing Securities Building, 505 Sichuan Road; Dekang Gold Shop, No. 51; and Rooms A and B at 555 Securities Building. The positions of those arrested are as follows: six securities firm employees, three brokers, six gold shop and silver shop employees, one tobacco company employee, and two unemployed individuals, totaling seventeen people. Rumors that some of these individuals have been successively released are completely false. The authorities are conducting a thorough investigation to determine whether or not to prosecute. This process requires a considerable amount of time. Once the facts are established, the case will be transferred to the Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted under the wartime criminal special law.</p>
<p>Future Policy of the Economic Division</p>
<p>The future policy of the Economic Division of the Special High Section of the First Police Bureau is generally as follows: rectify personnel, intensify prevention of economic crimes, resolutely punish all lawbreakers without any leniency, and aim to eliminate the masterminds of all measures. To achieve its original intention, the division is determined to overcome all difficulties and go all out, while closely monitoring internal discipline. It is also reported that the division, in order to value the people's livelihood, will handle all executed cases impartially and strictly. In the future, if any immoral profiteers are found engaging in speculation or manipulation, they will be prosecuted to eradicate the leaders of the black market.</p>

<h3>Financial Affairs Inspection Office Urges Banks to Tighten Lending; Stipulates Five Points for Tightening Loan Business</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank believes that the lending business of provincial financial institutions is intended to regulate funds and promote production. However, upon examining the detailed loan statements reported by various financial institutions, it has been found that many of the lending practices are inappropriate and even indirectly stimulate prices, which is improper. In order to assist the government in stabilizing prices and promoting production, the following points for attention in the lending business are hereby notified to all financial institutions in the city for strict compliance:</p>
<p>All major commodities such as cotton, cotton yarn, cotton products (including cloth and cotton fabrics), chemical industrial products (including raw materials, western medicine raw materials, fuel, and alcohol), wool and wool products, silk and silk products, industrial oils, candles, soap, matches, coal and coal briquettes, cigarettes and tobacco leaves, rubber (including raw materials and products), hardware (including raw materials and products of iron, steel, white iron, and non-ferrous metals), glass (including raw materials and products), electrical appliances (including raw materials and products), leather (including raw materials and products), hemp and hemp products, food such as flour and miscellaneous grains (including wheat, barley, barley, corn, peanuts, soybeans, broad beans), cooking oil (including raw oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil), and gold bars are not allowed to be accepted as loan collateral. For the above items, manufacturers may request collateralized loans for the original materials according to the second regulation. When applying for collateralized loans with raw materials or semi-finished products, it should be determined whether the borrower is indeed a manufacturer in the industry and whether the factory continues to operate and produce; otherwise, the loan should be refused. For merchants applying for collateralized loans with finished products or raw materials other than major commodities and gold bars, the lending should be tightened as much as possible. For general needs of working capital requesting collateralized loans with real estate or securities, the lending should be tightened as much as possible, and strict attention must be paid. If there is any suspicion of using the funds for hoarding materials, the loan must be absolutely refused. For the sake of their own soundness, banks should not provide credit loans.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Grain Merchants Will Be Ordered to Suspend Business</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the fluctuations in grain prices in this city, some illegal merchants have been operating black market transactions without obtaining licenses. This situation has a great impact on the market. Therefore, in the future, the Grain Bureau will strictly crack down on unregistered grain merchants. In addition to ordering them to suspend business, they will also be subject to considerable penalties. At the same time, in order to sympathize with merchants, the Grain Bureau will resume grain registration from March 1st. Those who meet the following conditions must immediately go to the bureau at Penglai Road, Nanshi, to obtain forms and apply for registration: newly established grain merchants, unregistered grain merchants, those who have registered but have not been approved, those who have registered but whose circumstances have changed (such as reorganization, increased capital, transfer of ownership, relocation). This registration will close at the end of March. If there is any further hesitation, the bureau will resolutely crack down without leniency.</p>
