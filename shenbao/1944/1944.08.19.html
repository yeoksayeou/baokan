<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">怎樣奮鬥 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>從生物學的立塲說，凡是生物時時刻刻</p>
<p>都要和環境奮鬥。人類是最高等的動物，人</p>
<p>類的進化史就是一部最詳細的奮鬥史，而在</p>
<p>大時代裹面，整個歷史就不過是一段人類相</p>
<p>互間的奮鬥紀錄。「優勝劣敗，適者生存」</p>
<p>是進化的原則，也是生存的原則，凡是能够</p>
<p>刻苦奮鬥的，方才能够生存，方幫有生存的</p>
<p>價值；凡是不能够奮鬥的，自然地要被淘汰</p>
<p>，也自然沒有生存的價值。</p>
<p>在大時代裹，我們更認定，奮鬥是現代</p>
<p>人的職口，特別在大東亞戰爭決戰時期，在</p>
<p>進行解放戰的時期，整個民族，存亡所繫，</p>
<p>每個人都不能逃避這個奮鬥的責任。古人說</p>
<p>：「學如逆水行舟，不進則退」，可是現在</p>
<p>在我們斗面前的困難，比逆水行舟還要苦，</p>
<p>而在我們的後面，卻不允許有退路，進則存</p>
<p>，退則亡，已經是顯明的事實。此時此地，</p>
<p>除了用全民族的力量，堅苦奪鬥以外，決沒</p>
<p>有第二條路可走。徬徨畏懼是不必的，躊躇</p>
<p>顧慮更是不需要的，我們只有奮鬥與前進。</p>
<p>奪鬥既然是不類的天職，我們就得研究</p>
<p>奪鬥的方法和步驟。我們先要立定計劃，勇</p>
<p>往直前。計劃必須周密和詳細，在計劃立定</p>
<p>之後，立即執行，要一鼓作氣的幹，決不可</p>
<p>有遲疑的觀望。一切事業，假如起頭做得好</p>
<p>，便已做了一半，所以開始的工作最為重要</p>
<p>。開始就有勇氣，先給人們一個明顯的印象</p>
<p>，更可獲取一般的同情，更容易吸引共同奮</p>
<p>鬥的同志。</p>
<p>其次，奮鬥的目的愈大，他的對象也愈</p>
<p>大，他的過程也愈長，他的困難也愈多，所</p>
<p>需的奮鬥力量也愈鉅。在一鼓作氣的時候，</p>
<p>一切是緊張的，到了半途，因為遭遇艱難，</p>
<p>每每漸由緊張而趨於鬆弛。意志堅強的人，</p>
<p>在這個奮鬥的中期，按照既定計劃，認淸目</p>
<p>標，不長　難，繼續前進，百折不回。環境</p>
<p>愈困難，奮鬥的力量愈增大，反抗的力量愈</p>
<p>大，奮鬥的意志愈堅定。任何困難，決不能</p>
<p>使他的志氣消沉而頹廢，任何阻礙，決不能</p>
<p>使他的工作略現後退。再接再勵，義無反顧</p>
<p>，這是奮鬥中期的唯一成功原則。</p>
<p>再次，在最後五分鐘，奮鬥到了成功的</p>
<p>期間，是人們最疲勞的時期，也是最最危險</p>
<p>的「功虧一簣」的時期。這時候能夠鼓起努</p>
<p>力的勇氣的不是物質的力量，而是精神的感</p>
<p>化，因為物質力量已經差不多到了限度，而</p>
<p>精神的力量卻是無限度的。「天行健，君子</p>
<p>以自強不息」，自強不息純粹是精神提示，</p>
<p>自強不息然後有大無畏的精神，然後能夠不</p>
<p>暇怠，不　安逸，然後能奮鬥到底，然後能</p>
<p>夠成功。</p>
<p>歷史是人類自己創造電，民族的命運是</p>
<p>民族自己決定的，人們奮鬥的成功和失敗亦</p>
<p>由人們自己把怎樣奮鬥的方法來判斷的，所</p>
<p>以大時代的人們，應當把奮鬥和怎樣奮鬥這</p>
<p>問題時常反省。</p>
<h3 id="c2">義國交還津租界雙方已舉行儀式　褚外長談接收義租界始末 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>天津十八日中央社電　中義兩國前於七月十四日，簽訂交還天津</p>
<p>義租界後，兩國間則進行交還並接收之準備。十七臼午前十一時，於市</p>
<p>政府大禮堂，舉行交還儀式。國府褚外長特為此事北來，並派范徐兩司</p>
<p>長參加典禮。巾國方面代表為天津市長張仁蟊，義國代表為義駐天津領</p>
<p>事夫里替皮，並由日本方面太田天津總領事列席參加。首由義夫里替皮</p>
<p>領事之公文書及目錄手交張市長，張市長受領後，以同樣公文書手交夫</p>
<p>里替皮領事。最後有太田總領事之祝詞，於長意義深長之租界交還式，</p>
<p>至此終了。</p>
<p>北平十八日中央社電　來此之國府外交部長褚民誼十八日上午九</p>
<p>時，於六國飯店會見記者團，暢談中國最後之天津義大利租界亦行交還</p>
<p>之意義，大意如次：余本為監督天津義大利租界交還細目而來者，然因</p>
<p>天氣關係，未能列席，頗感遺憾。天津亦為租界最多之都市，然已逐項</p>
<p>交還，在去年三月三十一日臼本租界交還之後，法國租界於六月五日交</p>
<p>還，其後即僅有義大利租界之存在。義政府雖已聲明交還租界，然因準</p>
<p>備工作關係，即去年九月巴特里奧事變時，得籍日本之協力，實行接收</p>
<p>。其後迨義大利樹立法西斯蒂共和政府，余乃與新大使夫里替皮閣下，</p>
<p>於東京開始交涉，七月十四日正式簽字。按此項租界即出自不平等條約</p>
<p>者，國父孫先生曾以終生之志，主張收回，現在余以外交部長之職，而</p>
<p>得於國父靈前，報吿租界之完全收回，此實乃無上之供禮。租界之收回</p>
<p>，有賴於盟邦臼本誠意協力之處甚多，今後決竭力發展舊租界之近代建</p>
<p>築，公共設施，及警察力等之長處，以期對新中國之建設，有所貢獻。</p>
<p>昨天日本中國派遣軍復發表期待中國統一之聲明，更為明暸，而國府對</p>
<p>此之態度。亦己明確。現在重慶軍民雖在高喊抗戰救國，然不知抗戰實</p>
<p>乃甘為英美驅使，東亞人不應受英美人之策動，而互相鬥爭。大東亞各</p>
<p>國更須堅固團結，向勝利之途邁進。戰局業入最後階段，今盟邦日本舉</p>
<p>全國國力而戰，共榮國內其他國家，立於援助之地位，中國更負有後方</p>
<p>基地之使命，現正努力增加生產，肅正思想，確立治安中。汪主席之病</p>
<p>態，據周秘書長稱，經過非常良好，吾等深信並祈禱，主席必可於最近</p>
<p>完全康復。</p>

<p>，經日軍猛烈反攻，戰力</p>
<p>已逐漸消耗，現退至衡陽</p>
<p>西部及西南部構築陣地。</p>
<p>採取守勢，日軍刻仍繼續</p>
<p>猛襲渝軍，並着着推進次</p>
<p>期作戰準備。衝陽附近渝</p>
<p>軍殘部陸續投降，據彼部</p>
<p>供稱，美軍將校一團，於</p>
<p>衡陽城內督戰，衡陽將陷</p>
<p>，卒率先逃走。淪軍對此</p>
<p>種卑劣行為，極為憤恨。</p>

<p>南方日軍前綫基地</p>
<p>十八日中央社電　傳去年</p>
<p>二月日軍自加達卡納爾島</p>
<p>轉進之際，曾有一部日軍</p>
<p>始終不離該島，與美軍奮</p>
<p>戰，頃據由南方歸來之南</p>
<p>方貿易汽船船長談稱：該</p>
<p>事確有證據，並非無稽，</p>
<p>去年八月下旬，曾突有敵</p>
<p>軍魚雷艇一艘衝至玻根維</p>
<p>爾島布英一帶之日軍基地</p>
<p>岸上，日軍當集中砲炎攻</p>
<p>擊，該艇頻發信號示無惡</p>
<p>意乃止，及談艇靠岸則七</p>
<p>名乘員皆係日軍不兵隊，</p>
<p>自言由加蓬卡納爾島來接</p>
<p>取聯絡路綫，並來接濟軍</p>
<p>火，並申述其藏軍岩穴，</p>
<p>伺隙夜襲，奪取敵軍食糧</p>
<p>彈藥，故能支持，至今日</p>
<p>忽見有敵魚雷艇員泊於岸</p>
<p>邊登陸他去，乃奪其舟逸</p>
<p>去，此行係奉官命令，來</p>
<p>連絡並乞賜予軍火食糧。</p>
<p>勸其暫時留住，則曰奉有</p>

<p>速賜軍火食糧，同時更述</p>
<p>其繼續殺敵之決心，言時</p>
<p>慷慨泣下，布英日軍甚為</p>
<p>感佩，立准其請，於是談</p>
<p>艇又滿載軍火食糧，再向</p>
<p>加達卡納爾島駛去，海濤</p>
<p>萬里，一去渺茫，確信彼</p>
<p>等當忠心如一，始終不屈</p>

<p>日本駐華艦隊報道部</p>
<p>松島部長，昨（十八日）</p>
<p>下午二時，在該部與本市</p>
<p>中國新聞記者定期會見席</p>
<p>松，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>美國侵略野心</p>
<p>美總統羅</p>
<p>斯福氏，</p>
<p>於七月中</p>
<p>旬在火奴</p>
<p>魯魯召急陸海軍將領會見</p>
<p>，對今後之作戰問題，有</p>
<p>所商討。並於返國途中，</p>
<p>視察阿留申羣島，至八月</p>
<p>中旬始返抵美國。按羅氏</p>
<p>此行，一方面在促進戰局</p>
<p>之開展，同時更具有政略</p>
<p>上之陰謀。其返美後發表</p>
<p>之第一次聲明如下：「此</p>
<p>次視察阿留申後，深覺美</p>
<p>國很有支配自阿拉斯加阿</p>
<p>留申西伯利亞以至中國的</p>
<p>一錢之必要，查阿拉斯加</p>
<p>與阿留申固屬美領，但西</p>
<p>伯利亞和中國，以美國立</p>
<p>塲以言，則為外土，而美</p>
<p>今圖謀以西伯利亞及中國</p>
<p>之一部，置於其勢力範圍</p>
<p>之內，斯意義極實重大」</p>
<p>同時威海　　公司社長（</p>
<p>按該員視察軍慶在該地，</p>
<p>逗留約五星期），本月二</p>
<p>十四日返美時曾發表言論</p>
<p>，其內容略謂：「重慶為</p>
<p>使戰後中國工業化起見，</p>
<p>現正準備確立全面之基礎</p>
<p>，已屬事實。重慶政府各</p>
<p>部已設立預備計劃案，起</p>
<p>草委員會同時為提高戰後</p>
<p>中國之經濟狀况，工廠組</p>
<p>織等等，使能與歐美標準</p>
<p>相等計，在建設計劃上，</p>
<p>要求外國參與援助，故我</p>
<p>人想像對美國之實業家以</p>
<p>至資本家，一定非常歡迎</p>
<p>的」。據本月十四日重慶</p>
<p>電構：羅斯福總統十二日</p>
<p>在華盛頓作廣播演講，「</p>
<p>在此戰爭中，俟日本之威</p>
<p>脅終了後，則整個太平洋</p>
<p>區域內，始有建立永久和</p>
<p>平之希望，吾人希望在經</p>
<p>濟商業之前途上，獲得自</p>
<p>然而適當之襲展，預料於</p>
<p>美國海岸至西伯利亞與中</p>
<p>國海岸之間，在商業上定</p>
<p>有大規模之交易」。對於</p>
<p>上述言論，本人有一點意</p>
<p>見，貢諸一般人士，深望</p>
<p>能加以研究。</p>
<p>應予深切反省</p>
<p>第一，難</p>
<p>道中國真</p>
<p>正不能在</p>
<p>軍事上，</p>
<p>經濟上，政治上以自立振</p>
<p>興嗎？希望各位要加以偵</p>
<p>實的撿討。本人過去十年</p>
<p>之間，擔任過與中國最有</p>
<p>密切關係之工作，對中國</p>
<p>眞實的力量，很能理解，</p>
<p>且很有自信，此結論認為</p>
<p>中國即無英美之援助，中</p>
<p>國亦可完全機立的。蓋中</p>
<p>國無論於資源人力均極充</p>
<p>裕，吾人深信祇要有良好</p>
<p>的指導者，與國民的覺悟</p>
<p>和團結幾點，即使無英美</p>
<p>之助力，亦能獨立振興。</p>
<p>中國資源蕴藏極富，究其</p>
<p>過去所以遭英美榨取之原</p>
<p>因，實由於指導階級之自</p>
<p>私，及民衆覺悟團結之不</p>
<p>足，根據此點以觀，戰發</p>
<p>中國決非不能以自力增強</p>
<p>國力，開發經濟。現下美</p>
<p>國已經支配着重慶之軍事</p>

<p>次表明若</p>
<p>戰後之</p>
<p>現想意見，倘若此項理想</p>
<p>一旦得以實現，則吾人認</p>
<p>為一大錯誤，吾人倘相信</p>

<p>亞戰爭亦無需發生，大東</p>
<p>亞戰爭所以勃發之原閃，</p>
<p>助在制止若　在經濟上之</p>
<p>擾亂。故吾人認為羅氏之</p>
<p>思想謬誤，假使此戰爭</p>
<p>如彼　所言，踴進下去，</p>
<p>則戰後所存者，則為較前</p>
<p>更增幾百倍之英美獨尊之</p>
<p>世界，試問中國在此英美</p>
<p>獨尊之世界中，將處何等</p>

<p>所以為打破英美之暴虐，</p>
<p>無論如何，須爭取吾們最</p>

<p>正規軍四十七萬七千人，</p>
<p>亦應列入國家軍隊，先予</p>
<p>以六個軍十八個師之軍隊</p>

<p>改稱為陝北行政區，使直</p>
<p>屬於行政院，實施重慶</p>
<p>令。但延安方面要求　改</p>

<p>施中之民主制度。　共黨</p>
<p>方面要求予以合法的地位</p>
<p>，且主張報紙雜誌之自由</p>
<p>發刊及言論自由。　延安</p>
<p>主張遊擊地區之軍事政治</p>
<p>經濟等，雖服從渝軍事委</p>
<p>員會之指令，但其指令僅</p>
<p>以有利抗戰為條件云。進</p>
<p>周恩來此次擊明，並未言</p>
<p>及調整交涉之障礙，其主</p>
<p>要點如何，或是否已趨全</p>

<p>— 隱公</p>
<p>這次衡陽作戰，是</p>
<p>八年來量激烈的一次戰</p>
<p>爭，淪方軍隊奉命死守</p>
<p>衡陽，艱苦作戰，自六</p>
<p>月二十八日到八月八日</p>
<p>，居然支持一個月零十</p>
<p>天。不料最後突然聽到</p>
<p>無條件投降，沒有一個</p>
<p>人不驚訝，幷且人人心</p>
<p>頭有這樣一個疑問，究</p>
<p>竟他們為什廢投降？如</p>
<p>果說是士無鬥志。他們</p>
<p>已經苦戰了四十一天，</p>
<p>幷且準備全體殉國，與</p>
<p>城共存亡，如果說投降</p>
<p>只是指揮守城軍隊的第</p>
<p>十軍長方先覺將軍個人</p>
<p>的意思，但方軍長於投</p>
<p>降後第二天對記者談話</p>
<p>，說這是所部四個師全</p>
<p>體的意思。他接到日方</p>
<p>勸吿後，召集部下，開</p>
<p>會商量，一致贊成投降</p>
<p>，沒有一人反對。由此</p>
<p>可見抗戰到底，死守衡</p>
<p>陽，本是他們的初衷，</p>
<p>放棄抵抗，實行投降，</p>
<p>乃是他們最後的覺悟。</p>
<p>投降的心理</p>
<p>但是他們為什麽覺</p>
<p>悟呢。這從方軍長的談</p>
<p>話中也可以看出來。他</p>
<p>說，抗戰八年以來，民</p>
<p>衆犧牲極大，受苦的都</p>
<p>是貧困的老百姓，大部</p>
<p>分有閑階級幷無國家觀</p>
<p>念。他眼見這種不合理</p>
<p>的抗戰，所以對抗戰救</p>
<p>國發生懷疑。他說因為</p>
<p>過去不了解中國現狀和</p>
<p>世界情勢，所以跟着盲</p>
<p>目抗戰。現在才知道新</p>
<p>中國健全發展的情形，</p>
<p>好像黑夜中忽見光明。</p>
<p>方軍長這番話，不</p>
<p>但說明衡陽全體投降軍</p>
<p>官和士兵的心理，並且</p>
<p>可以反映中國大部人軍</p>
<p>人的心理。閃為軍人只</p>
<p>知道服從，只知道救國</p>
<p>，政府拿抗戰救國的名</p>
<p>義來驅策他們，他們當</p>
<p>然熱血沸騰，奮不顧身</p>
<p>，拼命抗戰，盡軍人的</p>
<p>天職。但是一旦知道抗</p>
<p>戰不能救國，從然犧性</p>
<p>民衆，尤其是知道後方</p>
<p>種種不合理種種黑暗情</p>
<p>形，美國援助之不可靠</p>
<p>，自然會覺悟過來。方</p>
<p>軍長的談話市又說，因</p>
<p>為中日事變畏期化，重</p>
<p>慶將士已經對於抗戰的</p>
<p>矛盾而深深感到苦惱，</p>
<p>對於抗戰建國的可能性</p>
<p>，均感悲觀，只因不知</p>
<p>和平區的實際情形，所</p>
<p>聽到的無非是歪曲事實</p>
<p>的宣傳，所以他們還不</p>
<p>能放葉抗戰，跑出來參</p>
<p>加和平。如果他們了解</p>
<p>日本交還租界，撒廢治</p>
<p>外法權，賓行對華新政</p>
<p>策種種道義精神以及英</p>
<p>美窮凶極惡的行為和離</p>
<p>間中日的奸計，一定欣</p>
<p>然參加和平陣營。</p>
<p>覺悟的時機</p>
<p>根據方軍長的談話</p>
<p>，我們發生兩點感想。</p>
<p>第一，這次衡陽作職，</p>
<p>渝方守城的軍隊，苦戰</p>
<p>四十多天，已經盡了最</p>
<p>大的努力。最後他們因</p>
<p>為覺悟到盲目的抗戰和</p>
<p>不合理的抗戰並不足以</p>
<p>救國，反而使民衆受很</p>
<p>大的犧牲，所以毅然決</p>
<p>然，停止抗戰，我們站</p>
<p>在中國人的立塲上，對</p>
<p>他們非常同情。</p>
<p>第二，死守衡陽的</p>
<p>將士，可算已經四頭是</p>
<p>岸，但是中國還有大部</p>
<p>分的軍人，大都分的民</p>
<p>衆，或者本身執迷不悟</p>
<p>，估低日本的力量，相</p>
<p>信有美國空軍的協力，</p>
<p>即可以打敗日本，或者</p>
<p>雖然對抗戰前途發生懷</p>
<p>疑，但因為歪曲宣傳所</p>
<p>蒙蔽，不知道和平區</p>
<p>的實在情形，不知道日</p>
<p>本已經不以中國為敵的</p>
<p>眞意，也不知道英美控</p>
<p>制巾國大陸侵略中國領</p>
<p>土的野心，所以不能放</p>
<p>棄盲目抗戰，或脫離抗</p>
<p>戰陣營。但是事實已經</p>
<p>非常明顯。盲目抗戰，</p>
<p>並不能救中國，美國的</p>
<p>援助，並不可靠，抗戰</p>
<p>前途，越來越黯淡。日</p>
<p>本宣稱不以中國為敵，</p>
<p>確有誠意，美國軍隊利</p>
<p>用中國領土做根據地，</p>
<p>對中國的確不懷好心。</p>
<p>我們所佩的在衡陽苦戰</p>
<p>四十多天的將士已經全</p>
<p>體覺悟了，希望沒有覺</p>
<p>悟的必須從早確認現在</p>
<p>已是覺悟的時機了。</p>

<p>傳云亡，羊子隕西州之涕，中郎既逝，虎責興北海之思，當世失一執憲</p>

<p>呼天莫應，望盛儀而不見，搶地難追者耶。維我先生，秉性剛直，礪節</p>
<p>淸廉，早年遊學蓬滬，覃心法政，壯歲宣勞於吏治，著績秋卿，執法不</p>

<p>聊潔溪毛之薦，謹呈蒿里之詞，共表微忱，惟祈昭格，尚變。」</p>
<p>袁履登詞</p>
<p>公祭畢，自由袁履登致詞，略謂；「今日到會諸公，均</p>
<p>為衷心敬仰張　搏先生者，無論於人格及道德方面，張</p>
<p>先生皆值得吾人所敬仰。張氏雖已享年七十有餘，然張</p>
<p>氏在事業上既具有靑年人努力苦幹之精神，對於國家社</p>
<p>會，實屬重大損失，吾人如欲彌補此不可挽救之損失，惟有不志張氏生</p>
<p>前之道德人格，尤其希望張先中家屬方面，能繼其遺志，在事業上加緊</p>
<p>努力。」</p>
<p>吳頌皐詞</p>
<p>繼由市長代表吳秘書長致詞，略謂：「吾人在今日追悼</p>
<p>大會中悲痛之餘，要以積極的精神紀念張老先生，猶憶</p>
<p>張光生生前曾為司法經費及上海監獄問題，屢次曾與市</p>
<p>府當局進行商酌，結果前者決定每月由市府津貼若干，</p>
<p>以稍補司法經費之不足，其次監獄問題，　搏先生曾與兄弟在大雨中赴</p>
<p>上海監獄，參觀達三小時之久，結果張氏亳無疲狀，可見張氏生前對事</p>
<p>業上苦幹精神，堅不可搖。某次兄弟與雲搏先生談及對於市府職務，力</p>
<p>薄能鮮，不能勝任，頗有倦勤意思，但雲搏先生即以前輩聲色，嚴切戒</p>
<p>之，謂當此國家地位處於嚴實之秋，吾人必須捨棄小我，不辭艱辛，貢</p>
<p>獻一切，服務國家，萬不可稍存安逸之心，致誤國事，言時聲色俱厲，</p>
<p>兄弟聞之，大為感動，勉力做去，不再思倦勤之意。張氏個性亦特別剛</p>
<p>强，惟於剛強中，則又含有慈悲之意，張氏出任司法部長，一心一德，</p>
<p>欲對無法解決之因犯生活問題，不避艱難，力為改革，結果張氏竟即因</p>
<p>此積勞成疾，一病不起，吾人今日追悼張先生，如果以張先生之偉大人</p>
<p>格，曁苦幹情神，貫注到各人自己的事業上去，則社會必能澄淸，國家</p>
<p>必能復興。」</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>後復由社會福利部丁部長致詞，略謂：「張先生生前是</p>
<p>提倡節約最力之一人，故張氏生前對於節約協會貢獻殊</p>
<p>多，對於私人之盛大宴會，張氏亦厭惡殊甚，今張老先</p>
<p>生不幸逝世，然張氏精神，則猶存於世，吾人當繼張氏</p>
<p>遺志，如緊推行節約運動，同時張氏生前更極力提倡火葬，相信以後亦</p>
<p>能逐漸普及社會，如此始不失紀念追悼張氏之意義。」</p>
<p>船津致詞</p>
<p>張雲搏先生不幸於本年六月五日得病，終於十五日不治</p>
<p>作古，這是中國的一大損失，同時，更是國民政府的意</p>
<p>外莫大損失。就張先生自身而言，己年逾古種，壽齡天</p>
<p>與，但如張先生人格高潔的典型君子，誰壽齡近百，更</p>
<p>可為一世師表，以作現今社會的指導者。張先生自從民國十年辭去司法</p>
<p>部次長後，嗣後在民間二十餘年，常為社會而奔走，為公衆而盡力，民</p>
<p>國十六年吳縣兵亂民困，當時張先生即以犧牲一己精神，挺身而出，以</p>
<p>謀鄉黨民衆之福利。此次張先生所以應汪主席陳院長周副院長之請，</p>
<p>拋棄其多年在野之心，担常司法行政部之重任，其動機亦是完全出於同</p>
<p>樣的犧牲精神，他完全本「天下興亡匹夫有責」的國民責任觀念，完全</p>
<p>為國為民。記得當時上海各團體為張先生舉行歡送茶會的時侯，張先生</p>
<p>曾慨然的說：「此次本人的就任，一方面是因注主席的友情，以及陳</p>
<p>周兩氏的敦促，另一方面一般輿論，對於南京國民政府非難之聲太甚，</p>
<p>所以此種非難，是否根據事實，本人因身住上海，無法明瞭，希望能親</p>
<p>身參加國民政府，認淸偵相」。近來中國有力知名之士，往往固執明哲</p>
<p>保身，不願與聞國事，祗圖一己之安逸生活，但是張先生究全不同，身</p>
<p>雖在野，然仍為公衆事業僕撲奔走，且時常發表諄諄警世議論，不獨為</p>
<p>中國人戒，且為我日人</p>
<p>勉。張先生自就任司法</p>
<p>部長後，極力發揮嚴明</p>
<p>廉潔的精神，大行儉素，在「量入為出」的原則下，祇以個人所得的薪</p>
<p>金，過其簡樸的生活，並以身作則，為世模範，在此非常時期之中，可</p>
<p>惜一般中國官塲，在私生活方面過於奢侈，即超過其薪金以上數倍數十</p>
<p>倍的浪費，亦在所不惜。這種實僚若再以「麋潔從公」勸勉下屬，極不</p>
<p>合理。所以不論在口頭或　桿下，怎樣鼓吹廉潔政治，若無事實的表現</p>
<p>，結果必無成就。但是我們的張先生決不如此，我曾經在南京親自目睹</p>
<p>張先生的私生活，其樸素簡單的情形，寶足令人尊佩。同時張先生對於</p>
<p>職務方面，不但是忠寶，並且更富有熱誠。此次在炎暑逼人的氣候下，</p>
<p>親自視察　中華北各地司法機關的實况，終於在任務遂行之中，傳染了</p>
<p>猛烈的病毒，竟然不治作古，其精神實亦槍林彈雨戰塲上的殉國軍人，</p>
<p>同樣的偉大，對其壯烈的殉國，誠不堪悲痛之極。所以此次全國朝野都</p>
<p>一致悲悼，乃屬當然之事，如張先生這樣偉大的人物，我們希望能永久</p>
<p>領導政府與民衆，努力使中國能更進一步達到和平統一的領域，今目電</p>
<p>未遂，而先生已逝，誠是中國的一大損失，而今幽明異處，再不能一接</p>
<p>先生高潔仙鶴的風采，實不勝悲痛之至。</p>
<p>尾坂致詞</p>
<p>余聞張一鵬先生噩耗之時，適在武漢旅行途中，當時極</p>
<p>表扼腕，蓋張氏實為余所尊敬之中國名士中之第一人。</p>
<p>張先生之逝世，無論以中國言，以日本言，皆屬一大損</p>
<p>失。先生係法律界之先輩，且素負衆望，曩徇　注主席</p>
<p>之懇請，出任司法行政部長，對於整肅吏治，頗著功績，而不幸中途病</p>
<p>逝，天不假年，深為惋惜。余認為先生具有日本古代武士之風格，廉潔</p>
<p>不苟，居常寡然，接人寬和，常其就任之初，披瀝抱負，深異靑年人之</p>
<p>熱情，烈烈愛國之志，溢於言表，實為吾人敬慕不置，如先生者，誠所</p>
<p>罕覯。先生往年曾留學日本，故對於日本，極有理解，實為日本之中國</p>
<p>良友，故先生之逝，不僅為中國惜，更為日本悲悼也。以我輩報人立塲</p>
<p>言，厥為先生對於新聞，頗具理解，曾盡力援助上海言論界之前途及發</p>
<p>展，寄以深切之同情。蓋先生對於指導民心之動向，尤所關心，今日中</p>
<p>日兩國人士，於茲為先生舉行盛大之追悼會，思及先生在日之德行，益</p>
<p>憎感慨。又聞此次擬將追悼先生之禮金全部舉辦紀念事業，對於追悼先</p>
<p>生極具意義，盖如此方足表彰先生之德行，故樂為一言，以誌追悼之意</p>
<p>魯風報告</p>
<p>最後由大會總幹事魯風報吿二點：　吾人須以張氏人格</p>
<p>道德精神，繼續保留下去。　此次收到議金約計五十餘</p>
<p>萬，將移充教育基金，及其他福利事業經費。至詳細辦</p>
<p>法，將召集有關人士商討決定之，至於此次大會開支，</p>
<p>則由發起各團體共同負擔。</p>
<p>家屬謝詞</p>
<p>末由家屬代表張氏之子張　如致謝詞，略謂：「今日在</p>
<p>酷熱之下，承各機關及盟邦方面長官，在此舉行追悼大</p>
<p>會，實表示無限感激，今有一點，可告慰諸位者，即家</p>
<p>屬方面，決不有負諸位好意，而決本先父遺志，繼續努</p>

<p>本報前天發表了「一個落選學生的來信」</p>
<p>以後，承一部份讀者表示同情，畢竟「天真的</p>
<p>哀告，純潔的乞憐，」可以感動人心，真所謂</p>
<p>「誠之所至，金石為開。」讀者來函中，有的</p>
<p>捐錢幫助，有的贊許他貧而好學；有的願意補</p>
<p>助他書籍學費，還有人約他見面，想知道他家</p>
<p>庭生活的情形，種種美意，我們同深感激。</p>
<p>不過，我們有一點小意見，必須向愛護諸</p>
<p>君說明的。第一，這位落選學生來信的目的，</p>
<p>是要求特予核准助學金，他雖是家境淸貧，却</p>
<p>沒有要求助學金以外的幫助，况且，他並聲明</p>
<p>他的父親品性高昂，他的來信要求的希望不為</p>
<p>父親知道而遭受責備，所以，我們認為幫助他</p>
<p>升學，他是願意接受的，升學以外的幫助，也</p>
<p>許他的家長不願接受的。第二，我們為這位學</p>
<p>生發表的信的目的，是舉一個淸寒好學的實例</p>
<p>，從而要求讀者多多概捐助學金，對於一般遭</p>
<p>遇相同的學生，普遍幫助。我們的本位是辦理</p>
<p>大衆助學金，如果越出助學範圍，對於個人的</p>
<p>慈憫之心，固可欽佩，不過，在助學立塲上說</p>
<p>，我們碍難接受的。</p>
<p>因此，我們除將該生核准助學金以外，另</p>
<p>約面談，告以諸君熱心扶植之大德，並酌顧諸</p>
<p>君美意，補助書籍之費。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>一星期後，隆夫重又整頓行李，決定</p>
<p>回實京了。</p>
<p>「再過兩三年，我們全家就搬到東京</p>
<p>去住的，…」</p>
<p>離別時，父親所講的話，自巴很高興</p>
<p>地在等待着。</p>
<p>到車站來送行的母親和妹妹，並未表</p>
<p>現出有別離的態痛。尤其是枝妹的表情，</p>
<p>假裝什麽也不知道，而口是期待完全的解</p>
<p>決。但非常寡言的她，當火車動時，突然</p>
<p>面紅耳赤地說。</p>
<p>「請向大家帶好。」</p>
<p>聽到這句話的當時，並未加以思索，火車一</p>
<p>過熊本時，他突然注意到妹妹的話了。所謂「請</p>
<p>所向大家帶好」還句話，究竟是指誰說的呢？當</p>
<p>然不是指不認識的市來重家夫婦說的。那末，自</p>
<p>然就是偵人　！但把單數用復數說出來，偵可以</p>
<p>說是煞費苦心，這真是可笑又可愛。</p>
<p>（豹成貓了…）</p>
<p>女人能這探變，隆夫對之則不能不加以微笑</p>
<p>但事實，或許像母親所觀察的一樣。妹妹對</p>
<p>於偵人是漠不關心，那末在少女時代，就無須乎</p>
<p>存着那樣奇怪的敵視。總之，那種敵視就是熱情</p>
<p>的表示。熱情，是他們兄妹共同的性格。</p>
<p>隆夫在心坎上想像父親和妹妹訪問五十鈴號</p>
<p>士官次室的情形。當時偵人招待他們父女，也像</p>
<p>前次招待隆夫一樣，曾命令永兵拿來紅茶和點心</p>
<p>，但態度部非常豪爽，這是父親講的。</p>
<p>（老實說，士官次室的本氣偵不錯！）</p>
<p>枝妹熱情再度，在這樣地方突然折斷，是當</p>
<p>然的事。</p>
<p>據說，當時偵人把錦賣中包裏着的刀，讓父</p>
<p>親和妹妹看了。據說那是谷家世傳的實刀，但艦</p>
<p>到鹿兒島八港時，從家裹向母親要來，當作軍刀</p>
<p>掛在身邊，滿而春風地大講這段故事。</p>
<p>（實在是一幅書。）</p>
<p>隆夫想像到這種情形時，就有這種感覺。成</p>
<p>為　中人的年靑士官，佔領妹妹的心，這是用不</p>
<p>着費事解釋的。</p>
<p>（技妹這個傢伙，眼睛真高！）</p>
<p>隆夫從心眼裹非常高興，他妹妹所選擇的並</p>
<p>非其他男人，而是偵人。同時又想到，自己的莫</p>
<p>逆成為妹夫，關係更加密切，而且永久化，這是</p>
<p>如何令人高興的事呵！</p>
<p>這類事情在繼續不斷地聯想着，而隆夫始終</p>
<p>不感覺疲倦。（一三三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Strive <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>From a biological standpoint, all living things must</p>
<p>constantly struggle with their environment. Mankind is the highest form of animal, and</p>
<p>the history of human evolution is the most detailed history of struggle. In a</p>
<p>great era, the entire history is just a record of human</p>
<p>mutual struggle. "The superior wins and the inferior loses, the fittest survives"</p>
<p>is the principle of evolution and the principle of survival. Only those who are able to</p>
<p>endure hardship and struggle can survive and have the</p>
<p>value of survival; those who are unable to struggle will naturally be eliminated</p>
<p>and naturally have no value for survival.</p>
<p>In the great era, we are even more convinced that struggle is the</p>
<p>duty of modern people. Especially during the decisive battle period of the Greater East Asia War, in</p>
<p>the period of conducting the liberation war, the entire nation, whose survival is at stake,</p>
<p>no one can escape this responsibility of struggle. The ancients said</p>
<p>"Studying is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." But now</p>
<p>the difficulties we face are even more bitter than rowing upstream,</p>
<p>and behind us, there is no retreat. To advance is to survive,</p>
<p>to retreat is to perish, is already a clear fact. At this time and in this place,</p>
<p>besides using the power of the whole nation to fight hard, there is absolutely</p>
<p>no second way to go. Hesitation and fear are unnecessary,</p>
<p>and hesitation and concern are even more unnecessary. We only have struggle and advancement.</p>
<p>Since struggle is an innate duty, we must study</p>
<p>the methods and steps of struggle. We must first establish a plan and bravely</p>
<p>move forward. The plan must be thorough and detailed.</p>
<p>After the plan is established, execute it immediately. We must do it in one go, and we must never</p>
<p>hesitate or wait and see. All undertakings, if the beginning is done well,</p>
<p>are already half done, so the beginning work is the most important.</p>
<p>Beginning with courage gives people a clear impression,</p>
<p>and it is easier to gain general sympathy and attract comrades who are fighting together.</p>
<p>Secondly, the greater the purpose of the struggle, the greater its object,</p>
<p>the longer its process, the more its difficulties, and the</p>
<p>greater the strength required for the struggle. In the heat of the moment,</p>
<p>everything is tense. Halfway through, because of encountering difficulties,</p>
<p>people often gradually relax from tension. People with strong will,</p>
<p>in the middle of this struggle, follow the established plan, recognize the</p>
<p>objective, endure the hardship, and continue to move forward, never yielding. The more difficult the environment,</p>
<p>the greater the power of struggle, the greater the power of resistance, and the</p>
<p>more determined the will to struggle. No difficulty can</p>
<p>make his ambition depressed and decadent, and no obstacle can</p>
<p>make his work show even the slightest retreat. Continuing efforts without hesitation</p>
<p>is the only principle of success in the middle of the struggle.</p>
<p>Again, in the final five minutes, the period when the struggle reaches success</p>
<p>is the most tiring period for people and also the most dangerous</p>
<p>period of "failure for want of only one final effort." At this time, what can inspire the</p>
<p>courage to work hard is not material power, but spiritual influence,</p>
<p>because material power has almost reached its limit,</p>
<p>while spiritual power is limitless. "Heaven's movement is ever vigorous; the superior man</p>
<p>makes himself strong and untiring," self-improvement is purely a spiritual prompt.</p>
<p>Only with self-improvement can there be a spirit of great fearlessness, and only then can one not</p>
<p>be idle, not seek comfort, then be able to struggle to the end, and then be able</p>
<p>to succeed.</p>
<p>History is created by human beings themselves, and the destiny of a nation is</p>
<p>determined by the nation itself. The success and failure of people's struggle also</p>
<p>depend on how people judge the methods of struggle. Therefore,</p>
<p>people in the great era should constantly reflect on the question of struggle and how to struggle.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Italy Returns Tianjin Concession, Both Sides Hold Ceremony; Foreign Minister Chu Talks About the Beginning and End of Receiving the Italian Concession <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin, 18th (Central News Agency) - China and Italy signed an agreement on July 14 to return the Tianjin</p>
<p>Italian Concession, and the two countries have been preparing for the handover and reception. At 11:00 a.m. on the 17th, the handover ceremony was held in the auditorium of the municipal</p>
<p>government. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government came north specifically for this matter, and sent two directors, Fan and Xu, to participate in the ceremony. The Chinese representative was Tianjin Mayor Zhang Renmao, and the Italian representative was the Italian Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Filippi, with Ota, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, attending. First, Consul Filippi of Italy handed the official documents and catalog to Mayor Zhang, who received them and handed the same official documents to</p>
<p>Consul Filippi. Finally, Consul General Ota delivered a congratulatory speech. The long and meaningful concession handover ceremony</p>
<p>came to an end.</p>
<p>Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government, who came here, met with a group of reporters at the Hotel des Nations at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, and spoke at length about the significance of the final handover of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, China, the gist of which is as follows: I came here to supervise the details of the handover of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, but due to</p>
<p>weather conditions, I was unable to attend, which I regret very much. Tianjin is also the city with the most concessions, but they have been handed over one by one. After the Japanese Concession was handed over on March 31st of last year, the French Concession was handed over on June 5th, after which only the Italian Concession remained. Although the Italian government had declared the return of the concession, due to</p>
<p>preparatory work, it was not until the Patrizio incident in September of last year that it was received with the cooperation of Japan.</p>
<p>After Italy established the Fascist Republic government, I began negotiations with the new Ambassador, Mr. Filippi, in Tokyo, and formally signed the agreement on July 14. This concession originated from unequal treaties. The founding father, Mr. Sun, made it his lifelong ambition to reclaim them. Now, in the position of Foreign Minister, I am able to report to the founding father's spirit the complete recovery of the concessions. This is truly an supreme offering. The recovery of the concessions</p>
<p>relies heavily on the sincere cooperation of the allied nation Japan. In the future, we will strive to develop the strengths of the old concessions in modern architecture, public facilities, and police force, in order to contribute to the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China issued a statement expressing its expectation for China's unification, which is even clearer, and the National Government's attitude</p>
<p>towards this is also clear. Although the military and civilians in Chongqing are shouting about resisting Japan and saving the nation, they do not know that resisting Japan is actually</p>
<p>being driven by Britain and the United States. People in East Asia should not be incited by the British and Americans to fight each other. The countries of Greater East Asia must</p>
<p>strengthen their unity and move towards victory. The war situation has entered its final stage. Now, the allied nation Japan is fighting with all its national strength, and the other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere are in a position to assist. China has the mission of being a rear</p>
<p>base, and is now working hard to increase production, rectify thought, and establish public order. According to Secretary-General Zhou, Chairman Wang's illness</p>
<p>is progressing very well. We deeply believe and pray that the Chairman will be completely recovered soon.</p>
<h3 id="e3">War Situation on Various Lines of the Japanese Army <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Dispatch - The war situation on all fronts of the Japanese army today</p>
<p>is as follows: China Front, the Chongqing</p>
<p>74th, 79th, 100th,</p>
<p>62nd, 37th,</p>
<p>44th armies, and mechanized units,</p>
<p>attempted to recapture Hengyang, attacking all day long.</p>
<p>After a fierce counterattack by the Japanese army, their combat power</p>
<p>has gradually been depleted, and they have now retreated to Hengyang</p>
<p>west and southwest to construct defensive positions.</p>
<p>Adopting a defensive posture, the Japanese army is continuing</p>
<p>its fierce attacks on the Chongqing army, and is preparing for the next</p>
<p>stage of operations. Remnants of the Chongqing army near Chongyang</p>
<p>are surrendering one after another. According to their statements, a group of</p>
<p>American officers supervised the battle in Hengyang city. When Hengyang was about to fall,</p>
<p>they took the lead in fleeing. The surrendered soldiers were extremely resentful</p>
<p>of this despicable behavior. Burma Front, in the areas of Ramu and Tengyue,</p>
<p>the Japanese army, under all kinds of unfavorable conditions,</p>
<p>with high morale, bravely resisted the fierce offensive of the surrendered army. The Chongqing army, under the</p>
<p>cover of aircraft, repeatedly launched wave-like</p>
<p>attacks. The Japanese defenders inflicted</p>
<p>heavy blows on them in front of the positions, causing them heavy casualties. The Chongqing army is now using</p>
<p>the tunnel warfare tactics of Myitkyina to push</p>
<p>towards the center of the Japanese positions to engage in</p>
<p>combat. New Guinea Front, the</p>
<p>Japanese army in that area is still securing its bases west of Wewak and continuing to fight bravely.</p>
<p>The US military landed near Shao</p>
<p>Amsterlgangarg in the northwest of the islandhead peninsula,</p>
<p>and is actively constructing a contact</p>
<p>airfield.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline Base in the South</p>
<p>18th (Central News Agency) Dispatch - It is reported that last</p>
<p>February, when the Japanese army withdrew from Guadalcanal Island,</p>
<p>a unit of the Japanese army never left the island</p>
<p>and fought fiercely with the US military. Recently, according to a captain</p>
<p>of a Southern Trade steamship who returned from the South,</p>
<p>there is indeed evidence of this matter, and it is not unfounded.</p>
<p>In late August of last year, an enemy</p>
<p>torpedo boat suddenly rushed to the Japanese army base</p>
<p>shore around Buin Island. The Japanese army immediately concentrated its artillery fire</p>
<p>to attack. The boat frequently sent signals indicating no malicious</p>
<p>intent, so they stopped. When the boat docked, the seven</p>
<p>crew members were all Japanese soldiers,</p>
<p>who said they came from Guadalcanal Island to connect and retrieve the liaison route, and to resupply military</p>
<p>supplies. They stated that they hid their troops in caves,</p>
<p>seized the opportunity to attack at night, and seized the enemy's food and</p>
<p>ammunition, so they were able to persevere. Today,</p>
<p>they suddenly saw enemy torpedo boat crew members docking on the</p>
<p>shore and going ashore elsewhere, so they seized the boat and fled.</p>
<p>This trip was on official orders to</p>
<p>make contact and request military supplies and food.</p>
<p>They were advised to stay temporarily, but they said they had</p>
<p>orders from their superiors, which were urgent, and they hoped</p>
<p>to quickly receive military supplies and food. At the same time, they further stated</p>
<p>their determination to continue killing the enemy. As they spoke,</p>
<p>they were generous and wept. The Japanese army in Buin was very</p>
<p>impressed and immediately granted their request. So the boat was</p>
<p>again fully loaded with military supplies and food, and then sailed towards</p>
<p>Guadalcanal Island. The sea was vast,</p>
<p>and they disappeared. It is believed that they will be loyal and unyielding</p>
<p>to the end.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Dispatch - After Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu was appointed as the Director-General of the Japanese Wing-Assisting Youth Corps,</p>

<h3 id="e5">Director Matsushima Reveals the Enemy America's Ambition for Aggression, Refuting Roosevelt's Speech <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Fleet Press Department in China</p>
<p>Director Matsushima, yesterday (the 18th)</p>
<p>at 2:00 p.m., met with Chinese</p>
<p>newspaper reporters in this city at a regular meeting,</p>
<p>and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>America's Ambition for Aggression</p>
<p>US President</p>
<p>Roosevelt,</p>
<p>in mid-July</p>
<p>summoned army and navy generals in Honolulu for a meeting</p>
<p>to discuss future operations. He also inspected the Aleutian Islands on his way back,</p>
<p>and did not return to the United States until mid-August. This trip by Roosevelt</p>
<p>was not only to promote the development of the war situation, but also to pursue a political</p>
<p>conspiracy. His first statement after returning to the United States was as follows: "After</p>
<p>this inspection of the Aleutians, I deeply feel that the United States has</p>
<p>the necessity to dominate from Alaska, the Aleutians, Siberia, to China.</p>
<p>Alaska and the Aleutians are of course US territory, but Siberia and China,</p>
<p>from the US standpoint, are foreign lands. Now America is attempting to place</p>
<p>Siberia and a part of China within its sphere of influence, which is of great significance."</p>
<p>At the same time, the president of the Weihai Company</p>
<p>(it is said that the person visited military camps in the area,</p>
<p>staying for about five weeks) made remarks when returning to the United States on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>The contents of his remarks were roughly as follows: "Chongqing is preparing</p>
<p>to establish a comprehensive foundation for China's industrialization after the war, which is already a fact.</p>
<p>The Chongqing government has established a preliminary plan, and the drafting committee</p>
<p>is also preparing to improve China's economic situation after the war, and to</p>
<p>make factory organizations and other aspects equal to European and American standards. In the construction plan,</p>
<p>foreign participation and assistance are required, so</p>
<p>I imagine that American industrialists and capitalists</p>
<p>must be very welcome." According to a Chongqing</p>
<p>dispatch on the 14th of this month, President Roosevelt gave a radio address in Washington on the 12th, saying,</p>
<p>"In this war, after the threat from Japan ends, there</p>
<p>will be hope for establishing lasting peace in the entire Pacific region.</p>
<p>We hope to obtain natural and appropriate development in the future of the economy and commerce.</p>
<p>It is expected that there will be large-scale transactions in commerce between the American coast, Siberia, and the Chinese coast." Regarding</p>
<p>the above remarks, I have a point of view to offer to the general public, and I hope that</p>
<p>everyone can study it.</p>
<p>Deep Reflection Should Be Made</p>
<p>First, is it really</p>
<p>impossible for China</p>
<p>to become self-reliant and prosperous</p>
<p>militarily,</p>
<p>economically, and politically? I hope that everyone will investigate</p>
<p>and truly examine this. I have been involved in work</p>
<p>that is most closely related to China for the past ten years, and I have a good understanding</p>
<p>of China's true strength, and I am very confident. The conclusion is that</p>
<p>China can be completely self-reliant even without the assistance of Britain and the United States. Because</p>
<p>China is extremely rich in both resources and manpower, we deeply believe that as long as there are good</p>
<p>leaders and national awareness and unity,</p>
<p>even without the assistance of Britain and the United States, it can independently become prosperous.</p>
<p>China's resources are extremely rich, and the reason why it has been exploited by Britain and the United States in the past</p>
<p>is actually due to the selfishness of the leadership and the</p>
<p>insufficient awareness and unity of the people. Based on this point of view, China</p>
<p>is definitely able to strengthen its national strength and develop its economy through its own efforts after the war. Now, America</p>
<p>has already dominated Chongqing's military and</p>
<p>economic affairs, and will further dominate</p>
<p>Chongqing's political affairs in the future. Therefore, regarding this matter, I deeply hope that China's leaders</p>
<p>can recognize the new policies that Japan is implementing</p>
<p>and fully reflect on them.</p>
<p>Breaking Down British and American Tyranny</p>
<p>Second, Roosevelt and others have</p>
<p>repeatedly stated their</p>
<p>idealistic views for the post-war era. If</p>
<p>this ideal</p>
<p>is realized, then we</p>
<p>believe that it would be a big mistake. If we believe</p>
<p>Roosevelt's words, then perhaps the Greater East Asia War would not have needed to happen. The reason why the Greater East Asia War broke out was</p>
<p>to prevent economic disturbances. Therefore, we believe that Roosevelt's</p>
<p>thinking is flawed. If this war</p>
<p>continues as he</p>
<p>said, then what will exist after the war</p>
<p>will be a world of British and American supremacy that is hundreds of times greater than before.</p>
<p>In this world of British and American supremacy, what kind of</p>
<p>position will China be in? We really dare not imagine.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to break down the tyranny of Britain and the United States,</p>
<p>no matter what, we must strive for our final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Minister of Personnel May Request Demotion or Dismissal of Illegally Appointed Civil Servants; Four Articles of Implementation Measures Formulated <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Dispatch - On April 18th of this year, the</p>
<p>National Government amended the Civil Service Appointment Act,</p>
<p>adding a new Article 12, which states that</p>
<p>if a civil servant's appointment is found to be lacking</p>
<p>legal qualifications, the Ministry of Personnel may,</p>
<p>without going through disciplinary procedures, request a demotion or dismissal. Minister of Personnel Shen</p>
<p>Erqiao, in view of the fact that the ministry has been</p>
<p>achieving very little since it began handling civil service appointment reviews, believes that after the promulgation of the 12 articles of this law,</p>
<p>it will have a considerable effect on rectifying personnel administration. He has specifically</p>
<p>formulated four articles of implementation measures based on laws and regulations,</p>
<p>and in consideration of the facts, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the National Government, instructing all</p>
<p>agencies nationwide to strictly order their subordinates to</p>
<p>comply strictly in order to prevent the pursuit of undeserved advantages</p>
<p>and to maintain official integrity. The main points of the principles of the implementation measures are excerpted as follows: All</p>
<p>agencies inside and outside the capital should prepare a list of their subordinates' status</p>
<p>and send it to the ministry for registration, and add a</p>
<p>column for the acting date of the person to be appointed to the status registration form. In the future, if it is found that</p>
<p>the statutory acting period has been exceeded, it will not be reviewed.</p>
<p>Civil servants to be appointed must</p>
<p>submit for review within two months of the statutory acting period.</p>
<p>When submitting for review, they must also submit the current position appointment order. If it is found that the submission for review is overdue,</p>
<p>the acting position should be terminated in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Officials to be appointed must be submitted for review first</p>
<p>and then requested for appointment. If there are those who have been informally appointed by various agencies themselves,</p>
<p>even if a government order has been issued, the</p>
<p>ministry may request a correction and still order them to submit for review in accordance with the law. If there are unqualified persons, they will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of this law.</p>
<p>The time limit for requesting a review is generously specified.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 17 of the Implementing Rules of the Civil Service Appointment Act, the qualifications, rank, and</p>
<p>salary are reviewed and announced, and a request for review may be made</p>
<p>within one month, limited to one time. For the sake of balancing emotion and law,</p>
<p>the time limit is generously specified: two months inside the capital, three months outside the capital,</p>
<p>four months in North China, and five months in Hubei and Guangdong, still limited to one time.</p>

<p>submitted a resolution for a decisive battle with daring spirit at the final meeting on the 16th, which was unanimously adopted. The gist is as follows: The war situation is becoming increasingly intense and has now entered the final stage. The enemy continues to attack and our army is frequently mobilized. Reviewing the lessons of the old Dutch East Indies era, the pain and difficulties of today have actually been reduced. We must gather the total strength of both material and spiritual aspects, establish a new order in Greater East Asia, and, standing on justice, advance towards the path of building a new Java. The people of Java will swear to live and die with the Japanese army until the day of final victory, and complete this war.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Zhou Enlai Denies Adjustment of Relationship Between Chongqing and the Communists; Major Issues Not Resolved <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - Chongqing Propaganda</p>
<p>Minister Liang Han-ts'ao stated at a meeting with foreign</p>
<p>reporters that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had</p>
<p>been adjusted. Communist Executive Committee member Zhou Enlai immediately issued a statement</p>
<p>denying it. This incident is further evidence of the breakdown of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Political circles here are extremely concerned</p>
<p>about future developments. According to Zhou Enlai's</p>
<p>statement, which was a response to</p>
<p>questions raised by the Communist Party news agency Xinhua News Agency on the 8th of this month,</p>
<p>the statement comprehensively denied Liang Han-ts'ao's</p>
<p>statement and further mentioned the Xi'an talks. According to Zhou Enlai, the main points</p>
<p>decided in the Xi'an talks were as follows: Yan'an advocated that the adjustment</p>
<p>negotiations should be premised on the implementation of democratic politics</p>
<p>and the fair and reasonable resolution of the Kuomintang-Communist issues. Chongqing, however, advocated discussing only the current military</p>
<p>relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the border area issues. Regarding the organization of the Yan'an Communist Army, the Communist Party</p>
<p>advocated that the Eighth Route Army and the so-called regular army of 477,000 Communist Party members</p>
<p>currently engaged in guerrilla warfare in peaceful areas should also be included in the national army and be given the military</p>
<p>designations of six armies and eighteen divisions first. However, Chongqing advocated four</p>
<p>armies and twelve divisions. Chongqing will rename the</p>
<p>current so-called Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region government as the Shaanbei Administrative Region, which is directly</p>
<p>subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and implement Chongqing</p>
<p>orders. However, Yan'an requested that the current jurisdictional area</p>
<p>and the democratic system in implementation not be changed. The Communist Party</p>
<p>demanded that it be given legal status</p>
<p>and advocated the freedom of publishing newspapers and magazines and freedom of speech. Yan'an</p>
<p>advocated that the military, political, and economic affairs of the guerrilla areas, although subject to the instructions of the Chongqing Military</p>
<p>Council, should be conditional only on benefiting the war of resistance. Moreover,</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai's statement did not mention the obstacles to the adjustment negotiations,</p>
<p>what the main points were, or whether a comprehensive breakdown had occurred.</p>
<p>In short, the facts have proven that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party remains</p>
<p>unreconciled, similar to the situation four years ago, and cannot be easily resolved.</p>

After repeated discussions by the Vice-Ministers of various ministries, it is expected that it will be formally decided soon and put into implementation. The plan to mobilize will include those in charge of technology in national universities, research institutions, and middle schools, including staff in the science system.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a Fukuoka telephone dispatch, Mizuno Itaro, Director of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Province of Japan, visited various places in the South for inspection.</p>
<p>After a month and a half, he arrived in Fukuoka by plane from Taipei on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<p>The following is a record of Mr. Mizuno's impressions:</p>
<p>All parts of the South are moving towards cooperation with Japan, which is most exciting. Vietnam has recently been extremely calm, and indifference to the European war situation is increasing, while a friendly atmosphere with Japan is very strong. In addition, the new Thai cabinet's enthusiasm for cooperation with Japan is no less than that of the previous Phibun cabinet, especially in providing enormous assistance to the Japanese army economically.</p>
<p>Moreover, Burma happily celebrated its first anniversary of independence on the first of this month. In order to promote the complete unity of the Burmese people, the Greater Burma Alliance was established, and it is now putting all its efforts into completing the war.</p>

<p>Taiyuan, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The comprehensive battle results achieved by the Japanese army in Shanxi Province in mid-July were extremely significant. What is most noteworthy is that the Chinese side is also fighting side-by-side with the Japanese army, so the people's trust is increasingly strengthened. On July 22, the Chinese army attacked a 150-man suicide squad of the Ninth Regiment near Baojiayu, east of Qin County, and achieved great results. The general villagers, witnessing the strict discipline of the national army, were extremely grateful and provided full cooperation. The following is a record of the comprehensive battle results for July: number of battles, 231; communist forces engaged, 25,000; abandoned corpses, 1,020; prisoners captured, 236; destroyed landmine factory, 1; cooperatives, 3; captured mortars, 1; light machine guns, 9; grenade launchers, 7; automatic rifles, 6; in addition, there were many hand grenades, landmines, horses, etc.</p>

<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in a German weekly that the assassination attempt on Führer Hitler was carried out violently with thorough prior arrangements, so in the days before the incident, German combat command felt a sense of sluggishness. However, the knot could not be found. The situation only became clear when the bomb exploded on July 20. The British, Americans, and Soviets were naturally greatly disappointed by the failure of this assassination. From the German perspective, internal bad elements can be purged in one fell swoop, and the concentration of power in the German front and rear will inevitably be stronger than in the past. The enemy's attempt to sow discord in Germany has instead benefited the Germans.</p>

<p>According to a broadcast by the British Central</p>

<p>currently fighting in the suburbs of Paris.</p>
<p>After crossing the Eure River (Euer) near</p>

<p>immediately headed north and are now approaching</p>
<p>the Seine, attempting to encircle the</p>
<p>German troops who have broken out of the encirclement</p>
<p>in Normandy, so the German authorities</p>
<p>are paying close attention to it. Also,</p>
<p>the British, Canadian, and Polish troops in the</p>

<p>thereby widening the narrow passage between</p>

<p>are still engaged in fierce fighting for Chartres (43</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Saito Miheita, the new president of Manchukuo development, arrived here on the 17th. On the way, he spoke freely about his ambitions upon taking office, saying that whether or not the food problem is solved is a prerequisite for determining the victory or defeat of the war. The development of Manchukuo must be based on the policies of both Japan and Manchukuo, and strive to realize agricultural problems.</p>
<p>There are many problems with the structure of the development agency. Yu Yixin believes that the smooth promotion of the national development policy does not lie in the complexity of the structure. At present, the fundamental solution to the evacuation of the Japanese mainland lies in immigration to Manchukuo. From this, we can know that the development policy needs to be implemented quickly.</p>

<p>— Yin Gong</p>
<p>The Hengyang campaign was</p>
<p>the most intense battle in the past eight years.</p>
<p>The Chongqing army was ordered to defend</p>
<p>Hengyang to the death and fought hard.</p>
<p>From June 28th to August 8th,</p>
<p>they actually supported it for a month and ten</p>
<p>days. Unexpectedly, in the end, I suddenly heard</p>
<p>unconditional surrender, and no one</p>
<p>was surprised, and everyone</p>
<p>had such a question in their minds, what was the reason for their surrender? If</p>
<p>it is said that the soldiers had no fighting spirit, they</p>
<p>had already fought hard for forty-one days,</p>
<p>and were prepared to die for their country,</p>
<p>coexisting with the city. If it is said that the surrender</p>
<p>was only the personal intention of</p>
<p>General Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army who commanded the defending army,</p>
<p>but General Fang told reporters the day after the surrender</p>
<p>that this was the intention of all four divisions under</p>
<p>his command. After receiving advice from the Japanese side, he</p>
<p>gathered his subordinates and</p>
<p>held a meeting to discuss it, and unanimously agreed to surrender</p>
<p>, with no one objecting. From this</p>
<p>it can be seen that fighting to the end and defending Heng</p>
<p>Yang to the death was originally their original intention,</p>
<p>and giving up resistance and surrendering</p>
<p>was their final realization.</p>
<p>The Psychology of Surrender</p>
<p>But why did they</p>
<p>realize it? This can also be seen</p>
<p>from General Fang's talk. He</p>
<p>said that since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the</p>
<p>people have made great sacrifices, and those who have suffered are</p>
<p>the poor and the common people, and most</p>
<p>of the leisure class has no concept of the country.</p>
<p>Seeing this unreasonable</p>
<p>War of Resistance, he began to doubt</p>
<p>the War of Resistance to save the country. He said that because</p>
<p>he did not understand the current situation in China and</p>
<p>the world situation in the past, he blindly</p>
<p>fought against Japan. Now he knows the</p>
<p>healthy development of the new China,</p>
<p>like suddenly seeing light in the dark night.</p>
<p>General Fang's words</p>
<p>not only explain the psychology of all the surrendering</p>
<p>officers and soldiers in Hengyang, but also</p>
<p>reflect the psychology of most Chinese</p>
<p>soldiers. Because soldiers only</p>
<p>know how to obey, only know how to save the country</p>
<p>, and the government uses the name of resisting Japan to save the country</p>
<p>to drive them, they will naturally be passionate</p>
<p>and fight desperately</p>
<p>, fulfilling their military duties.</p>
<p>But once they know that resisting Japan</p>
<p>cannot save the country, it will naturally sacrifice</p>
<p>the people, especially knowing the</p>
<p>various unreasonable and dark situations in the rear,</p>
<p>and the unreliability of American aid</p>
<p>, they will naturally realize it. General Fang's</p>
<p>talk also said that because the Sino-Japanese Incident</p>
<p>has become protracted, the generals and soldiers in Chongqing</p>
<p>have been deeply troubled by the contradictions of the War of Resistance,</p>
<p>and are pessimistic about the possibility of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>Only because they do not know the actual situation</p>
<p>in the peace zone and</p>
<p>hear nothing but propaganda that distorts the facts</p>
<p>, they cannot abandon the War of Resistance and run out to participate</p>
<p>in peace. If they understand</p>
<p>Japan's return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial</p>
<p>rights, the new policy towards China based on moral principles, and the</p>
<p>heinous behavior of Britain and the United States and their</p>
<p>schemes to alienate China and Japan, they will definitely</p>
<p>gladly join the peace camp.</p>
<p>The Opportunity for Realization</p>
<p>Based on General Fang's talk,</p>
<p>we have two thoughts.</p>
<p>First, in this Hengyang campaign,</p>
<p>the Chongqing army defending the city fought hard</p>
<p>for more than forty days and had already made the most</p>
<p>efforts. In the end, they</p>
<p>realized that blindly resisting Japan and</p>
<p>unreasonably resisting Japan were not enough to</p>
<p>save the country, but would instead cause the people to suffer great</p>
<p>sacrifices, so they resolutely</p>
<p>stopped resisting Japan. We, standing</p>
<p>on the position of the Chinese people,</p>
<p>sympathize with them very much.</p>
<p>Second, the generals and soldiers</p>
<p>who defended Hengyang to the death can be considered to have seen the light,</p>
<p>but most of the Chinese soldiers,</p>
<p>most of the people, either are themselves obsessed and</p>
<p>underestimate the power of Japan,</p>
<p>believing that with the cooperation of the American Air Force</p>
<p>, they can defeat Japan, or</p>
<p>although they doubt the future of the War of Resistance,</p>
<p>they are blinded by distorted propaganda,</p>
<p>do not know the real situation</p>
<p>in the peace zone, do not know the</p>
<p>true intention of Japan not regarding China as an enemy,</p>
<p>and do not know the</p>
<p>ambition of Britain and the United States to control the Chinese mainland and invade Chinese</p>
<p>territory, so they cannot abandon blind resistance</p>
<p>or leave the anti-Japanese camp.</p>
<p>But the facts are already</p>
<p>very obvious. Blindly resisting Japan</p>
<p>cannot save China, and American</p>
<p>aid is not reliable. The future of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>is becoming increasingly bleak. Japan</p>
<p>claims that it does not regard China as an enemy,</p>
<p>is sincere, and the American army</p>
<p>is using Chinese territory as a base, and</p>
<p>definitely does not have good intentions towards China.</p>
<p>We admire the generals and soldiers who fought hard in Hengyang</p>
<p>for more than forty days and have fully realized this. We hope that those who have not</p>
<p>realized this must recognize as soon as possible that now</p>
<p>is the time to realize this.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Memorial Service for Former Minister Zhang Held Yesterday with Solemn Dignity, Attended by Representatives from Chinese and Japanese Communities <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The memorial service for the late Mr. Zhang Yunbo, former Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, was solemnly held yesterday (the 18th) at 4:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Guests from various circles included Mr. Wu Songguo, representing Mayor Chen, Liang Hongzhi, Liao Cun, Zhang Tao, Wen Lanting, Shen Siliang, Zhao Zhengping, Lu Runzhi, Li Sihao, Tang Senmin, Lin Kanghou, Que Ziyu, Wu Hufan, Yuan Ludeng, Pei Yunqing, Jin Zongcheng, Zhang Enlin, Zhang Jun, Chen Binhe, the heads of various courts and departments in Shanghai under the Ministry of Judicial Administration, representatives from the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, the Suzhou Sojourners Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai News Association, the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, and other groups. From the Allied nations, there were Consul General Shino, representing Ambassador Gu, Secretary Nakata, representing Minister Uesaki, Rear Admiral Kondo, Captain Shiota, Tatsui Tsunazu, Yato Osaka, Kahoda Hachiro, Toraji Kurimoto, Tosuke Yoshida, and family representatives such as Zhang Weiru and Yuan Rongchang, totaling several hundred people. Music was played by music teams from four groups: the Pingjiang Reformatory, the Shanghai Orphanage, the China General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, and the Police Bureau. The archway at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was inscribed with "Memorial Service for Mr. Zhang Yunbo." At precisely 4:00 PM, the memorial service began in solemn dignity amidst mournful music.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>Music was played, and everyone stood in silence. The chief officiant and assistant officiants presented flowers to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo.</p>
<p>Flowers were offered, the eulogy was read respectfully, and the most respectful salute was given to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo.</p>
<p>The chief officiant delivered a speech, reporting on Mr. Zhang Yunbo's deeds during his lifetime. Guests delivered speeches.</p>
<p>A report was given on the handling of the memorial donations for educational causes. The family representative delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Everyone bowed once to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo and then retreated. Music was played, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Respectful Reading of the Eulogy</p>
<p>Wen Lanting presided as the chief officiant, with Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, and others as assistant officiants. Banners of condolences from various circles hung above the platform. Wen Lanting, representing various figures, offered a sacrifice and respectfully read the original text of the eulogy as follows: "On this eighteenth day of August in the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, Lanting and others reverently offer pure wine and humble delicacies in sacrifice to the spirit of Mr. Zhang Yunbo, saying, 'Alas! The Taichuan is gone, evoking the tears of Yangzi in the western province. Zhonglang has passed, stirring the thoughts of Beihai for the tiger. The world has lost a talent of constitutional law, the sun and stars are dim, and the whole nation embraces boundless regret. The court and the public grieve, lamenting the passing of a model figure. Crying to heaven brings no response, hoping to see the grand ceremony, but it is not to be. Regret is hard to undo. Our teacher, with his inherent integrity, refined character, and upright incorruptibility, studied law and politics in Shanghai at an early age. In his prime, he proclaimed his labor in officialdom, achieving merit. He enforced the law impartially, deciding the case of Wang and Liu like a Xiezhi touching evil. He listened to lawsuits with clarity, creating the Binjiang prison like lighting a torch to illuminate wrongdoing. He adhered to the three-foot law, and his words could resolve disputes. The statutes he wrote were fairly judged. This was a continuation of the legacy of forbearance and an admiration for the high principles of Ji Teng. In middle age, he resigned and returned home, living a life of poverty for twenty years, safeguarding human rights until today, unaware of growing old. Suddenly, the autumn wind rustles, breaking the branches of the Tangdi tree. The cold moon is desolate, wounding the shadows of solitary geese. Eulogies are bitter, and old tears flow. Only a sense of the transience of life remains, with no ambition to serve the world. Yet, the central government issued a slight order that could not be refused. He resigned from Dongshan, only to rise again. Thus, he strived to fulfill his long-held aspirations, greatly expanding his grand plans, revising the laws of the Tingwei, as strict as autumn frost, comforting the prisoners in the jail, as warm as the spring sun, combining leniency and severity, exerting both authority and virtue. Again, he traveled long distances to inspect the judiciary of the former capital, instructing officials and spreading the clean winds of Taiwan Province. All these major accomplishments are clearly visible. Unexpectedly, accumulated labor led to illness, and the original foundation collapsed frequently. Lanting and others suddenly lost their reliance and are deeply saddened. Watching him travel to the Liaohai, when will he return to express his will? The waves choke the Shenjiang, looking at the layers of clouds without color. Let us cleanse the stream of its reeds, and offer these words from the Hao Li, expressing our meager sincerity, hoping for your gracious acceptance.'"</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Speech</p>
<p>After the public sacrifice, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating, "All the gentlemen present today sincerely admire Mr. Zhang Yunbo. In terms of both personality and morality, Mr. Zhang is worthy of our respect. Although Mr. Zhang lived to be over seventy, he possessed the spirit of a young man working hard in his career. His loss is a great loss to the country and society. If we wish to make up for this irreparable loss, we must emulate Mr. Zhang's morality and personality, and especially hope that Mr. Zhang's family will continue his legacy and work harder in their careers."</p>
<p>Wu Songgao's Speech</p>
<p>Following this, Secretary-General Wu, representing the mayor, delivered a speech, stating, "Amidst the sorrow of today's memorial service, we must commemorate Mr. Zhang with a positive spirit. I recall that during his lifetime, Mr. Zhang often consulted with the municipal government on judicial funding and the Shanghai prison issue. As a result, it was decided that the municipal government would subsidize a certain amount each month to alleviate the shortage of judicial funding. Regarding the prison issue, Mr. Zhang and I visited the Shanghai prison in heavy rain for three hours. Mr. Zhang showed no signs of fatigue, which shows his dedication to his career during his lifetime. Once, I discussed with Mr. Yunbo my feelings of being overwhelmed and incapable of fulfilling my duties in the municipal government, and expressed a desire to retire. However, Mr. Yunbo immediately rebuked me with the voice of an elder, saying that at this critical time for the country, we must abandon our own small selves, endure hardship, and contribute everything to serving the country, and never harbor any thoughts of comfort, lest we harm the country. His tone was stern, and I was deeply moved. I worked hard and no longer thought of retiring. Mr. Zhang's personality was also particularly strong, but within that strength, there was also compassion. Mr. Zhang took office as Minister of Judicial Administration with one heart and one mind, wanting to reform the unresolved living problems of the inmates, regardless of the difficulties. As a result, Mr. Zhang became ill from overwork and never recovered. Today, we commemorate Mr. Zhang. If we infuse his great personality and hard-working spirit into our own careers, then society will surely be cleansed, and the country will be able to be revived."</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Later, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare delivered a speech, stating, "Mr. Zhang was one of the strongest advocates of thrift during his lifetime. Therefore, Mr. Zhang made many contributions to the Thrift Association. Mr. Zhang also strongly disliked lavish private banquets. Now that Mr. Zhang has unfortunately passed away, his spirit still remains in the world. We should continue Mr. Zhang's legacy, such as vigorously promoting the thrift movement. At the same time, Mr. Zhang strongly advocated cremation during his lifetime. I believe that it will gradually become popular in society in the future. Only in this way can we commemorate Mr. Zhang's significance."</p>
<p>Tsunazu's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yunbo unfortunately fell ill on June 5th of this year and passed away on the 15th. This is a great loss for China, and even more so an unexpected and great loss for the National Government. As for Mr. Zhang himself, he was over seventy years old, and his lifespan was given by heaven. But a gentleman of Mr. Zhang's noble character, even if his lifespan were nearly a hundred, could be a teacher for the world and a guide for today's society. Since resigning as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang spent more than twenty years in the private sector, often working for society and doing his best for the public. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Wuxian suffered from military unrest and the people were in distress. At that time, Mr. Zhang sacrificed his own spirit and stepped forward to seek the welfare of the people in his hometown. This time, Mr. Zhang accepted the invitation of Chairman Wang, President Chen, and Vice President Zhou, abandoning his many years of life outside government and taking on the heavy responsibility of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. His motivation was entirely out of the same spirit of sacrifice. He was completely based on the national responsibility concept of "every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," entirely for the country and the people. I remember that when various groups in Shanghai held a farewell tea party for Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang said with emotion: "This time I took office, on the one hand, because of the friendship of Chairman Zhu and the urging of Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou, and on the other hand, general public opinion is too critical of the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, I am unable to understand whether this kind of criticism is based on facts because I live in Shanghai. I hope to personally participate in the National Government and recognize the true nature of the situation." In recent times, influential and well-known people in China often stubbornly maintain their own safety and are unwilling to hear about national affairs, only seeking their own comfortable lives. However, Mr. Zhang is completely different. Although he is in the private sector, he still rushes around for public affairs and often publishes earnest and cautionary remarks, not only as a warning to the Chinese people but also as encouragement to us Japanese. Since taking office as Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang has vigorously demonstrated the spirit of strictness, integrity, and thrift. Based on the principle of "living within one's means," he lived a simple life with his personal salary and set an example for the world. During this extraordinary period, it is a pity that the general Chinese officialdom is too extravagant in their private lives, even to the point of wasting several or dozens of times their salary, without hesitation. It is extremely unreasonable for such officials to admonish their subordinates with "incorruptibility and serving the public." Therefore, no matter how much one promotes incorruptible politics in words or documents, if there is no factual performance, the result will be no achievement. But our Mr. Zhang is definitely not like this. I have personally witnessed Mr. Zhang's private life in Nanjing, and his simple and plain situation is enough to make people respect him. At the same time, Mr. Zhang is not only loyal to his duties, but also full of enthusiasm. This time, in the scorching summer weather, he personally inspected the actual situation of the judicial organs in various parts of North China, and finally contracted a fierce virus in the course of fulfilling his mission, and unexpectedly died. His spirit is as great as that of the soldiers who died for their country on the battlefield of gunfire, and I am extremely saddened by his heroic martyrdom. Therefore, it is natural that the whole country and the public mourn together. We hope that such a great figure as Mr. Zhang can permanently lead the government and the people, and strive to make China reach a more advanced level of peace and unity. Now that his will has not been fulfilled and Mr. Zhang has passed away, it is truly a great loss for China. Now that we are in different worlds, and we can no longer see Mr. Zhang's noble and immortal demeanor, I am extremely saddened.</p>
<p>Osaka's Speech</p>
<p>When I heard the sad news of Mr. Zhang Yipeng's death, I was traveling in Wuhan. At that time, I expressed my deep regret, because Mr. Zhang was indeed the number one among the Chinese celebrities I respected. Mr. Zhang's death is a great loss, whether in China or Japan. Mr. Zhang was a senior in the legal profession and was highly respected. He took the request of Chairman Zhu to serve as Minister of Judicial Administration, and made great contributions to rectifying officialdom. Unfortunately, he died in the middle of the road, and heaven did not give him a long life, which is deeply regrettable. I believe that Mr. Zhang has the style of an ancient Japanese samurai, incorruptible and unpretentious, often indifferent, and approachable. At the beginning of his inauguration, he expressed his ambition, which was very different from the enthusiasm of young people. His ardent patriotism was overflowing, and he was truly admired by us. Such a person is indeed rare. Mr. Zhang studied in Japan in the past, so he has a great understanding of Japan, and he is truly a good Chinese friend of Japan, so Mr. Zhang's death is not only a pity for China, but also a mourning for Japan. From the standpoint of us reporters, it can be said that Mr. Zhang has a great understanding of the news, and he has done his best to help the future and development of the Shanghai media, and he has shown deep sympathy. Mr. Zhang is particularly concerned about guiding the direction of public opinion. Today, Chinese and Japanese people are holding a grand memorial service for Mr. Zhang. Thinking of Mr. Zhang's virtues in Japan, I am even more emotional. I also heard that this time, the memorial money will be used to organize memorial activities, which is very meaningful for commemorating Mr. Zhang, because this is enough to praise Mr. Zhang's virtues, so I am happy to say a word to express my condolences.</p>
<p>Lu Feng's Report</p>
<p>Finally, Lu Feng, the general director of the conference, reported on two points: We must continue to preserve Mr. Zhang's personality, morality, and spirit. The amount of money received this time is about 500,000 yuan, which will be used for education funds and other welfare expenses. As for the detailed method, relevant people will be convened to discuss and decide on it. As for the expenses of this conference, they will be jointly borne by the initiating groups.</p>
<p>Family's Words of Thanks</p>
<p>At the end, Zhang Ruzhi, son of Zhang, gave a thank you speech, briefly stating: "Today, under the scorching heat, I am very grateful to the heads of various agencies and Allied countries for holding this memorial service here. Now, I have one thing to tell you, that is, the family will definitely live up to your good intentions, and will follow the wishes of our father and continue to work hard." Finally, all the guests bowed to the portrait of Mr. Zhang, and in a solemn atmosphere, the music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Flour Over Ten Jin Requires Application for Transfer; Transfer Rules Implemented Today <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the suppression of flour transfers in the Shanghai area, the relevant authorities originally intended to restrict the transfer of flour of one bag or more, unless permission was obtained from the competent authority. Flour within one bag could be transferred without restriction. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Commodity Distribution Office, the Economic Security Office, and the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, yesterday (the 18th) at the Shanghai Flour and Noodle Distribution Office, jointly decided on the Shanghai area's flour and noodle transfer handling rules. The transfer of flour of ten market catties or more also requires an application for a transfer certificate, which will be implemented from today.</p>
<p>Transfer Rules</p>

<h3 id="e26">Police Bureau Strictly Limits Entertainment Venues' Business Hours <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government authorities, in order to conserve electricity, have stipulated restrictions on the hours of use of electric lights. They have placed particularly strict controls on the use of electricity in various entertainment venues, stipulating that business hours must end by 10:00 PM, and that lights must be switched off by 11:00 PM. While the majority have complied with these regulations, there are some who continue to operate beyond these hours, which is a violation of the regulations. The police authorities have already issued warnings, demanding strict compliance, or else violations will be dealt with according to the law with severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Next Term of Household Rice; Universal Sale Starts Tomorrow; Quantity and Price Remain the Same <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Through the joint efforts of the authorities, and under the supervision of the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, household rice distribution in the city has been restored, greatly benefiting the people. According to a report by a Central News Agency reporter, the distribution of household rice in the middle of this month has been stipulated by the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, and the city will begin universal sales as scheduled on the 20th, with each person still receiving two market sheng, and the price remaining unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Notice on the Establishment of a "Municipal Mailbox" <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>On August 1st of this year, the municipal administration was unified, and the authorities sincerely expressed their aspirations to start anew with the people and build a new Shanghai. All our citizens should work together to make this happen. However, in the process of cooperation, citizens may not fully understand various municipal measures and trends and need correct explanations. We believe that communication from the middle, so that officials and the people are not separated, is helpful to municipal construction. This newspaper, not presuming its thinness, intends to take on this communication work, and has specially set up a "Municipal Mailbox" to accept citizens' inquiries and provide answers. When necessary, the relevant authorities in various districts will answer and publish them publicly.</p>
<p>The rules are set as follows:</p>
<p>Questions in this mailbox are limited to the scope of municipal administration in this city.</p>
<p>The publication date of this mailbox is uncertain and will be announced at any time as needed.</p>
<p>The mailbox is limited to one question per letter as a principle. If there are several questions in one letter, they must be listed clearly.</p>
<p>Letters to the mailbox must be written clearly and with true names. A pseudonym may be used when publishing.</p>
<p>If this newspaper believes that the questions raised are not worth answering, they will not be answered.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the cigarette market, various miscellaneous cigarette brands have been rising sharply in price. The Market Management Committee, in view of the evolution of this situation, which is likely to cause unexpected problems, issued an emergency announcement yesterday to stop the rising trend, advising market traders not to engage in illegal transactions. The original text is as follows: "Recently, cigarette market prices have been rising daily. Although the reason is the lack of cigarette raw materials and power restrictions, resulting in a shortage of goods, it is also due to public panic and mutual competition, which is driving up market prices. In order to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring, it is hoped that all traders will comply with the following articles: 1. No buying and selling short; 2. No arbitrary price increases; 3. No buying and selling on behalf of non-industry people; 4. Absolutely prohibit the buying and selling of daily necessities. If there is any violation, once found out, it will be reported to the authorities for strict handling. It is hoped that everyone will know and not violate."</p>

<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3 id="e33">Out-of-School Youth Feels the Grace; Thanks to the Gentlemen Who Sympathized with the Failed Students <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>After this newspaper published "A Letter from a Failed Student" the day before yesterday, it was supported by some readers who expressed sympathy. After all, "sincere pleas and pure begging" can move people's hearts, which is truly "where there is sincerity, even metal and stone can be opened." In the readers' letters, some donated money to help, some praised him for being poor but eager to learn; some were willing to subsidize his books and tuition, and some even made an appointment to meet him to find out about his family life. We are deeply grateful for all kinds of good intentions.</p>
<p>However, we have a small opinion that must be explained to the benevolent gentlemen. First, the purpose of this failed student's letter was to request special approval for a scholarship. Although he is from a poor family, he did not ask for any help other than a scholarship. Moreover, he stated that his father's character is noble, and his request in the letter was not to be known by his father and be blamed. Therefore, we believe that he is willing to accept help to go to school, but his parents may not be willing to accept help other than going to school. Second, the purpose of this newspaper publishing the letter of this student is to give an example of a poor and eager-to-learn student, so as to ask readers to donate more to the scholarship fund and provide universal help to generally encountering students who encounter the same situation. Our position is to handle public scholarships. If we go beyond the scope of scholarships, the compassion for individuals is certainly admirable, but from the perspective of scholarships, we are embarrassed to accept them.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to approving the scholarship for this student, we will also meet with him and tell him about the great virtue of the gentlemen who enthusiastically support him, and consider the gentlemen's good intentions and subsidize the cost of books.</p>
<p>Chengyi Middle School Charity Performance to Help Students</p>
<p>Chengyi Middle School students are scheduled to perform "Thunderstorm" at the Lanxin Grand Theater on the 23rd of this month. The proceeds will be donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The letter reads: "Your newspaper took the lead in creating a scholarship fund to save hard-working students and bring great benefits to the people and society, which is known to women and children. Among the students of our school, there are also many poor and excellent children who have received the benefits of Yuan Hong and have been able to continue their studies. However, in recent years, life has become increasingly difficult, and there are many dropouts. The scholarship fund is limited, and it is inevitable that some will be disappointed. The students have witnessed this situation and are unwilling to lag behind. With the desire to relieve hunger and drowning, we are based on the wish to establish and achieve people, so we organized a fundraising team to collect money for your newspaper's scholarship fund, and it will be held on August 23rd at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM day and night two sessions, we will borrow the Lanxin Theater, and the students will perform 'Thunderstorm' for charity to thank all sectors of society and express our meager sincerity.

We have jointly established preferential treatment measures with specially contracted hospitals to provide services together.  Poor patients who apply for relief from this office are given satisfactory treatment upon introduction.  The spirit of service to the community by various specially contracted hospitals is admirable, and the sincerity of this office in fulfilling its social trust can also be somewhat gratifying. In order to enrich the medical expenses, a part of the medical aid fund is used to allocate funds to nine specially contracted hospitals as medicine resources for the poor and sick introduced by this office. Yesterday, the funds sent out included 10,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Ximen Women and Children Hospital and Hongren Hospital; 4,000 yuan each to Tongren Hospital and Shanghai Civilian Women and Children Hospital; and 3,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Health Association, Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, China Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, Liu Yongjun Eye Hospital, and Renaihui Andang Hospital.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated into foreign language</p>
<p>A week later, Ryufu tidied up his luggage again and decided to return to the capital.</p>
<p>"In another two or three years, our whole family will move to Tokyo to live..."</p>
<p>At the time of parting, what his father said made Bahar very happy to wait.</p>
<p>His mother and sister who came to the station to see him off did not show any pain of separation. Especially his sister's expression pretended to know nothing, but her mouth was expecting a complete solution. But she, who was very taciturn, suddenly blushed and said when the train moved.</p>
<p>"Please give my best to everyone."</p>
<p>At the time of hearing this sentence, he did not think about it. After the train passed Kumamoto, he suddenly noticed what his sister said. Who exactly is the so-called "Please give my best to everyone" referring to? Of course, it is not referring to the Ichiki Shigeya couple who are not acquainted. Then, of course, it is Jito! But it can be said that it took a lot of effort to say the singular in the plural. This is really ridiculous and cute.</p>
<p>(The leopard has become a cat...)</p>
<p>Women can be so easily changed, and Ryufu can't help but smile at it. But in fact, it may be as his mother observed. His sister is indifferent to Jito, so there is no need to have such a strange hostility in her girlhood. In short, that kind of hostility is a manifestation of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the common character of their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Ryufu imagined in his heart the scene of his father and sister visiting the officer's quarters of the Isuzu. At that time, Jito entertained their father and daughter, just like he had entertained Ryufu before, ordering Yongbing to bring tea and snacks, but his attitude was very bold, which his father said.</p>
<p>(To be honest, Jito's real nature in the officer's quarters is not bad!)</p>
<p>It is natural that Zhimei's enthusiasm broke off suddenly in such a place.</p>
<p>It is said that at that time, Jito showed his father and sister the sword wrapped in the Nishiki cloth. It is said that it was the real sword passed down from the Tani family, but when the ship arrived at Kagoshima Hachiko, he asked his mother for it from home and hung it around his waist as a military sword, telling this story with a spring breeze.</p>
<p>(It's really a picture.)</p>
<p>Ryufu had this feeling when he imagined this situation. It is not difficult to explain that the young officer who became a [illegible character] occupied his sister's heart.</p>
<p>(This Zhimei has really high standards!)</p>
<p>Ryufu was very happy from the bottom of his heart that his sister chose Jito instead of other men. At the same time, he also thought that his close friend became his brother-in-law, and the relationship became closer and permanent. What a happy thing this is!</p>
<p>These kinds of things continued to be associated, and Ryufu never felt tired. (133)</p>
