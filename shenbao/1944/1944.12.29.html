<h3>日海空部隊協力　夜襲桑霍塞敵船　大本營發表擊沉船艇十一艘</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十八日下午三時發表：（一）日軍水上部隊，十二月二十六日夜，突入明多羅島桑霍塞海面，排除敵機之阻碍，攻擊停泊附近之敵運輸船四艘及魚雷艇數艘，將其運輸船全部，魚雷艇一艘，小型舟艇二艘擊沉。同時，並砲擊敵機塲及物資堆棧，使附近一帶變成火海。（二）日軍航空部隊協力上項攻擊，轟炸敵機塲，數處炸毀起火外，並擊沉敵魚雷艇四艘。（三）此次决進攻日軍，有驅逐艦一艘重傷。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫二十八日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊，自二十五日傍晚至深夜，以有力之陸地攻擊機及新銳轟炸機編隊，反覆强襲明多羅島桑霍塞敵南北兩機塲，排除敵戰鬥機之抵抗，投下巨彈，五時半南機塲化成火海，敵防空砲火漸吿沉默，至深夜猶見火光冲天。另一隊於同夜攻擊雷伊泰鳥塔克羅班機塲，有一處發生大火，二十六日日海軍航空隊再度出動，連襲桑霍塞，塔克羅班兩機塲，予以重創。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地二十八日中央社電　日空軍二十六日夜半，再冒密雲往炸雷伊泰島，在敵猛烈之防空砲火中，猛襲巴倫本北部敵卸貨地點，連續投下之巨彈，燃燒敵物資倉庫及卸貨設施二處，全機安歸基地。</p>
<h3>日神風金剛隊　猛攻敵艦船　獲沉毀十二艘大戰果</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍基地二十八日中央社電　自上月二十五日以來，斂跡之敵機動部隊，十四日夜復以有力之運輸船團出現於菲律賓東南方海面，其後即於菲律賓全域，以其艦載機空襲各地，並於明多羅島之一角登陸，駐菲日軍航空部隊發見敵機動部隊出現後，即舉全力開始猛攻，同時待機中之神風特別攻擊隊第一金鋼隊以决第二，第三，第四金剛隊等，相繼由基地出發，撞擊艦船，勇行猛攻，命中其三艦，擊沉大型艦船三艘，幷使其大型運轍船四艘，巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘起火等。日軍金鋼隊之輝煌戰果，先後傳至特攻隊基地，因各機尙未報吿戰果及直接掩護機等突入敵艦關係，全戰果雖尙不詳，然過去因特攻隊基地總出擊之機數，竟達若干架之多，其戰果全部判明時，實可謂神風特別攻擊隊誕生以來空前之大戰果。</p>
<p>日軍航空部隊夜襲塞摩兩島</p>
<p>太平洋某基地二十八日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十六日夜復冒惡劣天氣，猛炸塞班島，對阿斯利特敵機塲加以猛擊，使其八處起火，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地二十八日中央社電　日航空部隊二十五日夜長驟急襲摩羅泰敵基地，使其二處起火，並擊沉魚雷艇一艘，然後全隊安然飛返。</p>
<h3>日特別挺進隊突擊卡來瓦</h3>
<p>北緬前綫日軍某基地二十八日中央社電　卡來瓦周邊戰事仍熾，日軍以巧妙之機動作戰，痛擊敵軍第十一師，同時日軍特別挺進隊與此呼應，首於十一月二十七日，突破蠢動於欽德溫河東岸之敵軍陣地，潛入該河西方，距離卡來瓦八公里之敵後方陣地。十二月七日，全員敢行決死攻擊，炸毀敵營房，車輛，兵器多數，衝入敵中，予以重創，陷敵於混亂狀態，然後歸還陣地。</p>
<h3>美海軍當局不發表損害</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓來電稱，美海軍長官佛萊斯特，二十五日接見新聞記者團時，曾陳述海軍當局對太平洋戰域之損害將採取不發表方針，其內容大意如次：於菲律賓水域，美國艦隊蒙受若干損害，乃係事實，然海軍當局至現在止，未將該損害發表之原因，乃係爲使日軍不明瞭受彼等攻擊之美艦隊中彈者，爲何種艦艇及損害程度，或經過若干時間，該等損傷艦艇，方可能再從事作戰等，又似曾有人驟稱，十月下旬與日本海空作戰所受損害，亦全部不發表，此則全然與事實相反。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　國民政府令（三十三年十二月二十八日）茲修正首都警察總監署組織法第一條，第二條，第二十一條，第二十六條條文公布之，此令。</p>

<p>陳代主席撥款振濟武漢災民</p>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　武漢無辜人民被敵機盲目轟炸，死傷甚慘，急待振濟，國府陳代主席深爲關懷，茲聞已令飭財政部撥發中儲劵三百萬元，交由湖北楊省長查云。</p>
<h3>蒙古明年度預算決定</h3>
<p>張家口二十八日中央社電　蒙古明年度一般會計及特別會計預算，二十七日已由政務院會議決定公布，一般會計歲出歲入均爲二億七千六百七十五萬餘元，歲出力謀削減與戰力無直接關係之經費，同時。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>助學運動的試金石</h3>
<p>助學運動可設是近年來社會上最有意義最可珍貴的一件事。這是同情心的流露，這是責任心的表現。允可貴者，助學金的集募完全出於讀者的自動，而且是從聚沙成塔集腋成裘的方式積聚而來。捐欵雖有多少，而牠可代表的同情心責任心却是同樣地偉火同樣地高超。這種情形眞是社會上最可欣喜的現象。</p>
<p>記得高夢旦先生說過現在社會上有兩件最不合理最不公平的事，就是需要醫藥的人沒有錢去看病吃藥，坐看有用之身，困於病魔以至於不治；有才智有作爲的靑年，沒有錢去求學，坐視有爲之才制於環境而無由發展。兩者都是赴會上極慘酷的事而後者尤爲國家社會莫可補償的損失。我們不必高談什麼主義，只要切實做到醫藥普及敎育普及，社會上種種不合理不公平的現象可算革除了一大半。我們細細體味這一番話，覺得眞是至理名言。</p>
<p>同情心有人認爲是人類本能之一。自己衣煖食飽自然會想到社會上還有許多飢寒交迫之人。自己的子女有機會求學，自然會想到社會上還有不少靑年受痛失學的痛苦。成人遭逢着慘酷的境遇或者還可以說咎由自取。無論如何兒童無辜，眼看着成千成萬可愛的靑年荒廢了學業，斷送了他們偉大的前程，於心何忍。我們不希望人人能做到捨己救人，祇要能推己及人，將自己個人自己子女的稱種享受稍爲分潤給社會上需要援手的人，失學問題是不難解決的。</p>
<p>責任心更是人類社會生存和發展的基本條件。社會本是個人集合而成。個人和社會是共存共榮利害相關的。社會的損失就是個人的損失，社會的福利就是個人的福利。基於這種認識，每個人都應該負起一種責任來求社會的進步，謀社會的福利。所謂「以天下爲已任」，不應認爲是「自許過甚」之詞，個人更不必因力量有限，而枉自菲薄。只要每個人能盡自己的力量，不論他力量的大小，則集合大衆的力量，何愁社會事業不舉。假如每個人都因個人力量微小而觀望消極，則社會公衆事業勢將無人過問。下一代的敎育不用說是現在社會上成人的責任。目前社會上有成千成萬的靑年受着失學的痛苦，試問社會上有力量的人應否肩負起救濟失學的責任來。</p>
<p>一個社會的欣欣向榮是靠着社會上各份子的互助合作，互助基於同情心，合作靠着責任心。助學運動是互助合作的事業，所以助學運動之能否持久與擴大是社會上同情心和責任心的試金石。</p>
<h3>蘇省建設會議　昨日開幕</h3>

<h3>蘇州漫話</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者奉派到蘇，觀光一切，擬將此行所得，今後陸續報道。茲以行裝甫卸，以就日來觀感所及，先草「蘇州漫話」一篇，提供本報讀者，俾作臥遊，至爲文拙劣非所計也。</p>
<p>旅途一瞥</p>
<p>月之廿日晨九時一刻，記者雇車抵達北站，當時距列車開行時間尙早，故即排入旅客伍中，等候軋粟，初尙穩靜，不圖移時軋票員駕臨，開始工作，一時旅客騷動，前擠後擁，秩序大亂。記者身不由主被擁至軋票入口，費盡九牛二虎之力。衛出重圍，擠入月合，迅速奔赴列車所在，登車期得一席，詎意車廂內座位，早爲捷足先登者佔據滿座。但車廂之另一端，則有一武裝者臂纏紅字臂章，昂然而獨立，獨據入席，而多數旅客，祗得佇立，記者亦爲其中之一。初意此武裝同志必虛位候其長官駕臨，但直至車已開行，仍係獨身。記者距座近在咫尺，亦祗可望而不可坐。車中無聊，對此事允覺百思不解。車行至崑山，此君下車，乃以手示意招坐，記者已感疲乏，當即趨坐。此等事件，今後有改進必要。路局旣掛有軍用專車，優待軍人，似不應再「與民相爭」，佔用民衆照章購票後，應得之座位權利。</p>
<p>姑蘇風光</p>
<p>諺云：「佛須金裝，人要衣裝」，在此世風日下，「祗衣衫不重人」之時代中，此語尤具人生哲學。蘇垣向有天堂之稱，居民必華衣麗服，但考諸實際，目前除極少數例外，一般隱貧至夥，允多外强中乾，除武裝同志，別具一格，狐裘大皮，高跟絲襪，亦僅屬於一般各處來蘇之淘金女郞。街頭頗多寄賣商店，內部珍貴之細毛皮貨，懸掛橱中，詢諸店中執事，此等皮裘，皆係受客家委托代售，足證在生活高壓之下，一般市民不得已而忍痛割愛。</p>
<p>蘇市茶樓酒館集中地的觀前街，太監弄宮巷一帶，每當華燈初上，頗爲熱鬧，高朋滿座。著名之松鶴樓，內部完全保持舊式飯店之面目，當有年近花甲之黑籍君子，手持特大之水烟筒，往來週旋於顧客之間，裝烟供客吸食，三十年前風景，迄猶存在。公用同一烟袋，以衛生常識而言，殊望而生畏也。至講吃茶之通，蘇人之閒散情緖，實不讓北平旗人。太監弄之「吳苑」，堪稱個中翹楚，上至鄕紳名流，下至走販小卒，莫不趨之若驚。而一般落拓文儒士紳，視爲消磨長日之去處。又蘇垣之糖食店，亦係遐邇聞名，此種店肆，鬧區街頭比比皆是，奈目前原料飛漲，尤以糖爲最，成本之繁重，致售價亦猛漲不已，影響營業殊巨。詢諸業中人，據謂目前大批購買之主顧，皆係外鄕人，用以備贈親友，其餘之零星交易，始爲常地主客，頗有不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>吳中山水淸秀，過去一般文人雅士，達官名流，卜居此間，度其晚年悠優生活者頗多。如李根源章太炎輩乃其中著者。事變以還，因四鄕治安欠佳，鄕間稍有資產者，亦多率眷住蘇。今蘇城又爲省會所在，公務人員又多，人口已達七十餘萬，早感人滿之患，覓屋不易，租價飛騰，日有實行以米作房租之辦法。至以蘇州房屋之本質而論，除主要之鬧市大街例外，其餘里巷房屋，泰半陳舊不堪，但出高價收買，猶恐求之不得者，仍大有人在。至一般素擅勝景名宅大厦，早爲外埠擁巨資者，搜羅殆盡。所謂地產商，及掮客等輩，年來莫不在數次轉手間，已搖身一變，而爲互腹賈矣。</p>
<p>蘇垣之一切設備，皆趨都市化，惟獨路政一項仍極落伍。在都市中慣走柏油馬路的人們，到此實感石子馬路之崎嶇不平，如乘人力車，其索價之昂，令人昨舌。因石街之故，「三輪」車尙未風行，而早受時代淘汰之敞蓬馬車，不意在此頗出風頭，記者搭車試乘，單程僅索價八十金。又蘇城城門口駐有軍警，行人至此，皆須下車步行，而車夫則翻墊張蓬，拖空車經過崗位，以示無私，此舉至今，日久生疏，似僅具形式，記者頗感徒擾行旅，不啻多此一舉，蓋以本人經騐言，自身每日往來多次，從未受一次之檢查，豈「文武百官到此下馬」之遺風乎？</p>
<h3>日機夜襲遂贛兩機場　渝機九架中彈起火</h3>
<p>大陸基地二十八日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，二十七日夜襲渝軍遂贛兩機塲，渝機九架及陸上設施一處中彈起火，其詳情如次：是日，日機一隊突破濃密雲層，猛炸遂川機塲，炸毀小型機三架，（內一架係直擊彈）燒却大型機一架，小型機二架，設施一處，（或爲機塲）滑走路亦中彈毀壞，另一隊日機，同時轟炸贛州，炸毀大型機二架及滑走路設施等兩隊，日機均無事歸返云。</p>
<p>廣州地區擊落敵機</p>
<p>大陸基地二十八日中央社電　最近渝機對華南方面空襲，逐次熾烈，二十七日上午十一時二十分，渝P51型機十六架來襲廣州地區，對郊外重要地帶以機槍掃射，日戰鬥機隊立即邀擊，當展開激烈空戰，計擊落渝機四架，地上砲火亦一齊猛射，更擊落其二架，空陸共計收得擊落擊破九架之戰果，來襲渝機五分之二全歸於盡云。</p>
<p>安慶方面擊落三架</p>
<p>（中央社訊）駐渝美空軍於二十五日午後三時，以P51型機一架，侵入安慶地區偵察，經當地海軍部隊迎擊，倉惶遁走，二十六日午後五時許，敵再度以P51型機七架來襲，由制空部隊擊落三架云。</p>
<h3>新運會歡迎日神尾博士</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　盟邦衆議院代議士神尾博士，日前因事來華，新運會特乘便表示歡迎，於昨二十八日下午三時，假中山北路該會外禮堂舉行「新運座談會」，出席者除神尾博士外，有鍾副總監，許副敎育長，新運會幹部人員等均列席參加，席間對新運工作各項要點詳加檢討，各抒意見，至五時許始畢。</p>

<h3>雅典會議結束　贊成設攝政</h3>
<p>日內瓦二十八日中央社電　德國社訊：據雅典非官方消息，星期三在雅典舉行之會議，已決定贊成設立攝政，但於何時設立，則意見不一，大多數代表則欲立即解決此問題。又據英國廣播公司消息，雅典政治會議已吿結束，其結果與若干提議，目下正在檢討中。</p>
<p>邱吉爾談希臘局勢</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹二十八日中央社電　德國社訊：週四晨所獲消息稱，邱吉爾曾向諸記者宣稱，英已決定肅淸雅典及鄰近地區，蓋英於希已有足敷調遺之軍隊也。又據來自雅典之官方報吿稱：邱吉爾曾稱，渠不久即將會晤羅斯福曁斯達林，希局勢將於彼時改觀，希臘未成立適當之政府以前，英人將不離希，倘希人不能自求解決之辦法，則勢必成立「希臘國際托辣斯」。</p>

<p>德軍使用各種武器</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍司令部某參謀稱，攻擊反軸心軍陣地之德軍並非最後之後備隊，此僅後備軍之第一批耳。本月十六日德軍之攻勢，已使西綫戰事入一新時期，德軍之攻擊，各種武器均參加，坦克車隊及摩托化部隊兵步當前鋒突破美軍之陣地，德空軍助戰甚力，德特別衛兵則以自動武器切斷包圍美軍及短距離攻勢，至於德秘密武器是否應用，則未提及。</p>

<h3>銀行公會昨開　十六屆常會　報告會務通過四議案</h3>
<p>上海特別市銀行同業公會，於昨（廿八）日下午四時，召開第十六屆會員常會，各會員銀行均派代表出席，首由主席葉扶霄致開會詞，詞畢，即由秘書長林康侯報吿半年來會務經過。當經討論：（一）追認通過和豐，國富，廣興，聯康，安達，南京興業，中一信託，利生信託，福民，三新，達成十一家銀行入會案。（二）通過本年決算及卅四年上屆預算案。（三）通過理監事會決議卅四年提高征收特別費案。（四）通過裕蘇銀行上海分行申請入會案，直至六時許始吿散會。</p>
<p>會務報吿</p>
<p>集體安全</p>
<p>茲將林秘書長報吿會務情形如下：「自本年六月廿八日召集第十五次會員大會辦理改遷之後，瞬又半載，在此期間，金融法令，迭有修改，市面情况，亦張弛不定，上升，任何事業，成感支絀，銀行亦何能例外，猶幸同業大體經營，尙稱穩定，而維持不易，爲共同之事實，故時至今日，而言銀行業務，可謂實無坦途可循，好高驚遠，固非所宜，墨守成規，亦容有未能，無已，審時度勢，實事求是，恪遵功令，體念時艱，共注意於生產事業之輔助推進，及謀金融業集體之安全，循此途徑，縱不能躋於繁榮亦不失素位而行之意，或尙得相互維繫，風雨共濟。</p>
<p>放款限制</p>
<p>本會半年以來凡所承轉法令，曁辦理同業公共事務，本以主旨期相勉旃，計前後召開理監事會常務理事會銀錢業聯席會議，及各項小組委員會，都凡二十四次，此半年中政府頒發有關金融事業之法令，約達十餘起，其較重要者，如六七月間滬市金價在漲，財政部嚴令取締，重申銀錢業放款限制辦法三項，對於放款用途，尤須嚴密審查，倘有用於投機方面，助長物價者，當嚴懲不貸，訓令轉行，會員一體凜遵。金融機關之增資，依法應先呈部核准，而歷來各銀行每多未先呈請，已登報公吿並召集股東會者，殊屬不合規定。財部亦訓令務須依照管理金融機關暫行辦法辦理，遠當從嚴懲處</p>
<p>修正辦法</p>
<p>管理金融機關暫行辦法，已於上年實施，此次財部再加修正，撮其要點：（一）金融機關已經分設之營業處所，須在一個月內，呈請補行註册，另須營業執照。（二）金融機關之公會，其附屬機關，如聯合準備庫票據交換所等，亦應補行呈請核准。（三）對於違反法令部份，處罰金數額，視原定亦有增加。其餘同法施行細則，又銀行註册章程有關條文均連帶修正。最近十月間復有「强化上海市金融機關業務綱要」之頒行，其主旨純爲納金融業於軌範，並約束投資途徑起見，故對於銀行資金及存款，均有最低數字規定。又有款準備金提高至百分之卅，商店工廠放款亦明定以三百萬元爲限額，其餘證劵投資塡報存款總數表格，以至金融機關重要職員之執黨方面，均有嚴密之訂明。未幾，檢查金融事務處復根據該綱要釐訂辦法，以利實行，以事在當局用意深長，一部份實施以還，同業自無不遵辦，惟最初之時，因爲期甚促，銀錢業本身實亦不無困難之點，因雖婉爲陳述，冀收實効，故事後尙不發扞格難行。</p>
<p>機構改組</p>
<p>查上屆大會議決，本會爲增進辦事效率及機構完整起見，內部組織應予革新，後經理監事會推定委員，另組小組會議，擬有方案，其組織稱要，大致爲將原有秘書處撤銷，改設總務審核兩處，並另組法規業務管理三研究小組會，藉以輔助理事會推進會務，俟人事方面決定之後，明春當可改組就緒。乘大會之便，合爲先行提出報告。」</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>「一毛不拔」與「深得吾心」　昨捐款近百萬盼再接再厲</h3>
<p>「商品助學，意義最深。」這意思是說工商企業界，各以其榮譽出品，認隊捐歡，使人深印腦海，永遠不忘，利己利人。近一月來，各工廠早經推行，不乏先例。昨承梁新記牙刷廠認組「一毛不拔」隊，這四個字原是榮新記廣吿陳語，但頗「幽默」；好像隱射海上一般富翁，私人揮霍，窮奢極侈，遇到社會福利，「一毛不拔」，這種人的確很多。其實也怪可憐，憑你家產怎樣富，到了最後關頭，還不是一塲空夢！前幾天新星藥廠以「深得吾心」認隊，這四個字恰巧與「一毛不拔」相反，當時姚俊之君表示「深得吾心」預備無限制的犧牲，即使捐滿五萬元一隊的有一千人，甚至一萬人，也照樣奉贈，其慷慨精神，殊可佩服！我希望「一毛不拔」的人，也能改變作風，一諾萬金，多多捐款，愈積愈多，使五千子弟，以及無量數的淸寒子弟，都不失學，都有書讀，而我們助學運動，卒獲成功，那眞是「深得吾心」了。</p>
<p>宏恩醫院護士助學</p>

        <h1>1944.12.29</h1>
<h3>Cooperation Between Japanese Naval and Air Forces: Night Attack on Enemy Ships at San Jose; Imperial Headquarters Announces Eleven Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 28th: (1) On the night of December 26th, Japanese naval forces penetrated the waters off San Jose, Mindoro Island, overcoming enemy aircraft obstruction to attack four enemy transport ships and several torpedo boats anchored nearby, sinking all transport ships, one torpedo boat, and two small boats. Simultaneously, they shelled enemy airfields and material depots, turning the surrounding area into a sea of flames. (2) Japanese air forces cooperated in the above attack, bombing enemy airfields, destroying and setting fire to several locations, and sinking four enemy torpedo boats. (3) In this resolute offensive, one Japanese destroyer was heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese naval air forces, from dusk to late night on the 25th, repeatedly and strongly attacked the enemy's north and south airfields at San Jose, Mindoro Island, with powerful land-attack aircraft and newly developed bomber formations. Overcoming the resistance of enemy fighters, they dropped massive bombs, turning the south airfield into a sea of flames by 5:30 PM. Enemy anti-aircraft fire gradually silenced, but the firelight was still soaring into the sky late into the night. Another unit attacked the Tacloban airfield on Leyte Island on the same night, causing a large fire. On the 26th, Japanese naval aviation units again sortied, repeatedly attacking both the San Jose and Tacloban airfields, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the night of the 26th, Japanese air forces braved dense clouds again to bomb Leyte Island. Amidst heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, they fiercely attacked the enemy unloading point north of Balunben, continuously dropping massive bombs, igniting two enemy material warehouses and unloading facilities. All aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Japanese Kamikaze "Kongo" Unit Fiercely Attacks Enemy Warships; Achieves a Great Victory of Sinking or Destroying Twelve Vessels</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base, Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Since the 25th of last month, the enemy's mobile task force, which had been lying low, reappeared on the southeastern sea of the Philippines on the night of the 14th with a powerful transport convoy. Subsequently, its carrier-based aircraft launched air raids throughout the Philippines, and it landed on a corner of Mindoro Island. After the Japanese air forces stationed in the Philippines discovered the enemy mobile task force, they launched an all-out fierce attack. Simultaneously, the first "Kongo" Special Attack Unit, which had been waiting for an opportunity, along with the resolute second, third, and fourth Kongo units, departed from their bases one after another, colliding with warships and launching courageous and fierce attacks, hitting three enemy ships, sinking three large warships, and setting fire to four large transport ships, one cruiser, and one destroyer. The glorious battle results of the Japanese Kongo unit have been successively transmitted to the Special Attack Unit base. Because the results of each aircraft have not yet been reported, and direct cover aircraft and others penetrated the enemy fleet, the full results are still unknown. However, considering the total number of aircraft sorties from the Special Attack Unit base, which reached a considerable number, when the full results are confirmed, it can be said to be an unprecedented great victory since the birth of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Forces Night Attack on Saipan and Iwo Jima</p>
<p>A Certain Base in the Pacific, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the night of the 26th, Japanese air forces braved inclement weather to fiercely bomb Saipan Island, launching a fierce attack on the enemy airfield on Aslito, setting eight locations on fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the night of the 25th, Japanese air forces launched a sudden and swift raid on the enemy base at Morotai, setting two locations on fire and sinking one torpedo boat, before the entire unit safely returned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Commando Unit Attacks Kalewa</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Northern Burma Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The fighting around Kalewa remains intense. The Japanese army, using skillful maneuver warfare, severely attacked the enemy's 11th Division. Simultaneously, the Japanese Special Commando Unit, in response, first broke through enemy positions active on the east bank of the Chindwin River on November 27th, infiltrating the enemy's rear positions eight kilometers west of Kalewa on the west bank of the river. On December 7th, the entire unit bravely launched a do-or-die attack, destroying numerous enemy barracks, vehicles, and weapons, charging into the enemy ranks, inflicting heavy damage, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion, and then returning to their positions.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Authorities Do Not Release Damage Information</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, when meeting with a group of journalists on the 25th, stated that the Navy Department would adopt a policy of not releasing information on damage in the Pacific war zone. The gist of his statement was as follows: It is a fact that the U.S. fleet suffered some damage in the waters of the Philippines, but the reason why the Navy Department has not released this damage information up to now is to prevent the Japanese military from knowing what type of ships in the U.S. fleet were hit by their attacks, the extent of the damage, or how long it would take for these damaged ships to be able to re-engage in combat. Furthermore, it seems that someone abruptly claimed that all damage suffered in the naval and air battles with Japan in late October would also not be released, which is completely contrary to the facts.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) National Government Order (December 28, 33rd Year of the Republic) The amendments to Articles 1, 2, 21, and 26 of the Organizational Law of the Capital Police Headquarters are hereby promulgated. This is the order.</p>
<h3>U.S. Donated Goods to Prisoner of War Camps in Occupied Territories</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Goods donated by the United States to enemy prisoner of war camps in Japan and occupied territories were reportedly loaded onto the Japanese ship Hakusan Maru earlier this month and transported to Japan. On January 4th, the Japanese ship Nippon Maru will depart from Kobe to transport them to prisoner of war camps in China. As for the Philippines, it is reported that they will be successively transported there soon.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen Allocates Funds to Aid Wuhan Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The innocent people of Wuhan have been blindly bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in severe casualties and a pressing need for relief. Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government is deeply concerned and has reportedly ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate 3 million Central Reserve Certificates to be entrusted to Governor Yang of Hubei for investigation and distribution.</p>
<h3>Mongolia's Budget for Next Year Determined</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Mongolia's general account and special account budgets for next year were decided and announced by the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 27th. Both general account revenues and expenditures are over 276.75 million yuan. Efforts will be made to reduce expenditures that are not directly related to combat effectiveness. At the same time.</p>
<p>The Moment of Farewell for the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Touchstone for the Student Aid Movement</h3>
<p>The student aid movement can be said to be one of the most meaningful and valuable things in society in recent years. It is an expression of compassion, a manifestation of responsibility. What is particularly commendable is that the fundraising for student aid comes entirely from the initiative of readers, and it is accumulated through the method of "many grains of sand making a tower" and "many fox furs making a robe". Although the donations vary in amount, the compassion and responsibility they represent are equally great and equally sublime. This situation is truly the most gratifying phenomenon in society.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Gao Mengdan saying that there are two most unreasonable and unfair things in society today: one is that people who need medicine do not have the money to see a doctor and take medicine, and sit idly by as their useful bodies are trapped by disease to the point of being incurable; the other is that young people with talent and potential do not have the money to go to school, and sit idly by as their talents are restricted by the environment and cannot develop. Both are extremely cruel things in society, and the latter is an irredeemable loss to the country and society. We don't need to talk about any high-sounding ideology; as long as we earnestly achieve universal medical care and universal education, we can say that we have eliminated a large part of the various unreasonable and unfair phenomena in society. When we carefully consider these words, we feel that they are truly words of wisdom.</p>
<p>Some people believe that compassion is one of the basic instincts of human beings. When we are warm and well-fed, we will naturally think of the many hungry and cold people in society. When our own children have the opportunity to go to school, we will naturally think of the many young people in society who are suffering from the pain of being out of school. Adults may be said to have brought their cruel circumstances upon themselves. In any case, children are innocent. How can we bear to see thousands upon thousands of lovely young people wasting their studies and ruining their great futures? We do not expect everyone to be able to sacrifice themselves to save others; as long as we can empathize with others and share a little of our own personal enjoyment and that of our children with those in society who need help, the problem of being out of school will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Responsibility is an even more fundamental condition for the survival and development of human society. Society is essentially a collection of individuals. Individuals and society coexist, prosper together, and are intertwined in their interests. The losses of society are the losses of individuals, and the welfare of society is the welfare of individuals. Based on this understanding, everyone should assume a responsibility to seek the progress of society and the welfare of society. The so-called "taking the world as one's responsibility" should not be regarded as "overly self-important," and individuals should not underestimate themselves because of their limited strength. As long as everyone can do their best, no matter how great or small their strength, then by gathering the strength of the masses, why worry that the cause of society will not be advanced? If everyone is passive and watches from the sidelines because their individual strength is small, then the cause of public affairs will inevitably be unattended. It goes without saying that the education of the next generation is the responsibility of the adults in society today. At present, there are thousands upon thousands of young people in society who are suffering from the pain of being out of school. May I ask whether those in society who have the power should shoulder the responsibility of rescuing those who are out of school?</p>
<p>The flourishing of a society depends on the mutual assistance and cooperation of all members of society. Mutual assistance is based on compassion, and cooperation relies on responsibility. The student aid movement is a cause of mutual assistance and cooperation, so whether the student aid movement can last and expand is a touchstone for compassion and responsibility in society.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>I was dispatched to Suzhou to observe everything and plan to report on what I have gained from this trip in the future. Since I have just unpacked my luggage, I will first write "Random Thoughts on Suzhou," based on my observations in recent days, for the readers of this newspaper, so that they can take a virtual tour. My writing is拙劣, please don't take it to heart.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Journey</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM on the 20th, I hired a car to reach the North Station. At that time, it was still early before the train departure time, so I immediately lined up among the passengers to wait for stamping the tickets. At first, it was still calm, but unexpectedly, when the ticket stamper arrived and started working, the passengers were agitated, pushing and shoving forward and backward, and the order was completely chaotic. I couldn't help but be pushed to the entrance to stamp the tickets, expending a great deal of effort. I fought my way out of the encirclement, squeezed into the platform, and quickly ran to where the train was, hoping to get a seat. Unexpectedly, the seats in the carriage had already been fully occupied by those who had arrived earlier. However, at the other end of the carriage, there was an armed person with a red armband, standing proudly and independently, occupying a seat alone, while the majority of passengers had to stand, and I was one of them. At first, I thought that this armed comrade must be keeping the seat vacant for his superiors, but even until the train had started, he was still alone. I was very close to the seat, but I could only look at it and not sit. Bored in the carriage, I felt very puzzled about this matter. When the train arrived at Kunshan, this gentleman got off and waved for me to sit down. I was already tired, so I immediately went to sit down. Such incidents need to be improved in the future. Since the Railway Bureau has military special cars to give preferential treatment to soldiers, it does not seem appropriate to "compete with the people" and occupy the seats that the public should be entitled to after purchasing tickets in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>The Scenery of Gusu</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Buddhas need golden clothes, people need attire". In this era of declining morals, where "clothes are valued more than people", this saying is especially philosophical. Suzhou has always been known as paradise, and its residents must be dressed in gorgeous clothes. However, in reality, apart from a very few exceptions, the general population is actually very poor, and most are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Apart from the armed comrades, who have a unique style, the fox fur coats and high-heeled silk stockings only belong to the gold-digging women who come to Suzhou from all over the place. There are many consignment shops in the streets. Precious fine fur goods are hung in the display cabinets. When I asked the staff in the shop, they said that these fur coats were all entrusted by customers for sale, which proves that under the high pressure of life, the general public has no choice but to part with their beloved items.</p>
<p>The area of Guanqian Street and Taigan Lane Palace Lane, where Suzhou's teahouses and restaurants are concentrated, is quite lively when the lights are turned on. Famous Songhelou restaurant completely maintains the appearance of an old-fashioned restaurant. There is an old gentleman approaching sixty, holding an extra-large water pipe, going back and forth among the customers, loading tobacco for customers to smoke. The scenery of 30 years ago still exists. Using the same pipe for public use, in terms of hygiene, is really daunting. As for the customs of tea drinking, the leisurely mood of Suzhou people really does not give way to the banner people of Beiping. The "Wu Yuan" in Taigan Lane can be called the leader in this regard. From local gentry and celebrities to peddlers and small soldiers, everyone rushes to it. It is regarded as a place to pass the long day by the general unemployed literary scholars and gentry. In addition, Suzhou's sugar food shops are also famous far and wide. This kind of shops are everywhere in the downtown streets, but at present, raw materials are soaring, especially sugar, which is the most expensive. The heavy cost has led to a sharp increase in prices, which has greatly affected business. When I asked people in the industry, they said that the main customers who buy in large quantities are all people from other places, who use them as gifts for relatives and friends. The rest of the retail transactions are from local customers, which makes them feel the changes of the past and present.</p>
<p>The scenery of Wuzhong is beautiful and clear. In the past, many literati and elegant scholars, officials and celebrities, chose to live here and spend their late years in leisure. Such as Li Genyuan and Zhang Taiyan are among the authors. Since the incident, because the public security in the four rural areas is not good, those with a little property in the countryside have also led their families to live in Suzhou. Now Suzhou City is also the location of the provincial capital, and there are many civil servants, and the population has reached more than 700,000, which has long been plagued by overcrowding. It is not easy to find a house, and rents are soaring. There is a daily practice of using rice as rent. As for the nature of Suzhou's houses, except for the main downtown streets, the rest of the alleys and houses are mostly dilapidated, but they are still afraid that they will not be able to find them even if they pay high prices. As for the general famous houses and mansions with scenic beauty, they have long been searched for by those who have huge capital from other ports. The so-called real estate developers and brokers have transformed themselves into rich merchants in several transfers over the years.</p>
<p>All the facilities in Suzhou are becoming more urbanized, but the road administration is still very backward. People who are used to walking on asphalt roads in the city feel the ruggedness and unevenness of the cobblestone roads here. If you take a rickshaw, the price is so high that people are stunned. Because of the stone streets, "three-wheeled" vehicles are not popular, and the open carriage, which has long been eliminated by the times, unexpectedly has a lot of limelight here. I took a car for a test ride, and it only cost 80 gold for a one-way trip. In addition, there are military police stationed at the city gate of Suzhou. Pedestrians must get off and walk when they arrive here, and the coachman turns the mat and pulls the empty car through the post to show that he has no selfishness. This move has been unfamiliar for a long time, and it seems to be only a formality. I feel that it is just disturbing the journey and is nothing more than an extra effort. Because of my own experience, I go back and forth many times every day, and I have never been checked once. Is this the legacy of "all civil and military officials dismount here"?</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Night Raid on Sui and Gan Airfields; Nine Yu Aircraft Hit and Caught Fire</h3>

According to official reports from Athens, Churchill said that he would soon meet with Roosevelt and Stalin, and the situation in Greece would change at that time.

<h3>Luxembourg North-Central Battles Extremely Active; German Troops Retreat to Siegfried Line</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German authorities announced on the 27th that the battles in northern and central Luxembourg are very active. To avoid losses, German troops are now retreating to outposts in front of the Siegfried Line at several locations.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Eisenhower Headquarters, German forces have occupied 3,200 square kilometers of territory in Belgium and Luxembourg in the twelve days since the start of this offensive, advancing 93 kilometers.</p>
<p>Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency: According to an American journalist embedded with the U.S. First Army, the sudden appearance of the German Air Force surprised the American forces on the Western Front. Most American soldiers believed that the German Air Force was a thing of the past, and this sudden appearance was unexpected.</p>
<p>German Army Uses Various Weapons</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas: An officer of the German High Command stated that the German troops attacking the anti-Axis positions are not the last reserves, but only the first batch of reserves. The German offensive on the 16th of this month has ushered the Western Front into a new phase. Various weapons are participating in the German attacks. Tank units and motorized infantry are at the forefront, breaking through the American positions. The German Air Force is providing strong support. Special German guards are using automatic weapons to cut off and surround American troops and launch short-range offensives. However, it was not mentioned whether German secret weapons are being used.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London report, a German radio station broadcasted that the German army under the command of Field Marshal Rundstedt is now using high-performance bombs. According to the broadcast, everything living in the area where these bombs are dropped dies. Forests are burned, and vast areas are turned into scorched earth. Anyone who comes into contact with the blast is turned into ash.</p>
<p>The Final Great Battle Is About to Unfold</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Due to the urgent crisis on the Meuse River front, the American army has used all its strategic reserves for the defense of the east bank of the Meuse River, attempting to stop the German army. According to front-line reports, Field Marshal Rundstedt has gathered a new elite reserve force on the Ardennes front, completing a major breakthrough towards Antwerp. This force includes the 5th Panzer Army and the 7th Mechanized Army, totaling twenty divisions. According to Associated Press, the German High Command has bet everything on this offensive. The final and greatest battle of World War II is about to unfold.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas: The outcome of the German offensive in southern Belgium continues to affect the development of the Western Front situation. Although General Eisenhower has deployed a large number of troops to participate in the war, he has still failed to shatter the German army's initiative. German war reports state that new German weapons have destroyed many anti-Axis tanks, proving that the war is gradually becoming a war of attrition. The anti-Axis counter-offensive is now slightly more systematic, with the aim of breaking through the German vanguard from both sides of its base. However, Eisenhower has not yet fully gone through the stage of consolidating defenses, so the German advance has not been stopped on the Meuse River front. Some of the troops fighting in that area have been transferred to other areas to implement planned offensive and defensive plans. The pressure from the anti-Axis forces in the south has been considerably intensified during Christmas. The pressure in central Luxembourg and north of Cologne remains very strong. General Patton is now making every effort to break through Bastogne to relieve the American troops trapped there.</p>

<h3>Bankers Association Held 16th Annual Meeting Yesterday; Report on Association Affairs, Four Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Bankers Association held its 16th member annual meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). Representatives from all member banks attended. Chairman Ye Fuxiao delivered the opening remarks. After the speech, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the association's affairs over the past six months. After discussion: (1) retroactive approval of the admission of eleven banks including Hefeng, Guofu, Guangxing, Liankang, Anda, Nanjing Xingye, Zhongyi Trust, Lisheng Trust, Fumin, Sanxin, and Dacheng. (2) approval of this year's final accounts and the budget for the previous year (34th year). (3) approval of the board of directors' resolution to increase the collection of special fees in the 34th year. (4) approval of the application for membership by the Shanghai branch of Yu Su Bank. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Report on Association Affairs</p>
<p>Collective Security</p>
<p>The report on association affairs by Secretary-General Lin is as follows: "It has been half a year since the 15th member general meeting was convened on June 28th to handle the relocation. During this period, financial laws and regulations have been revised repeatedly, and the market situation has been fluctuating. Rising [prices] make any business feel strained, and banks are no exception. Fortunately, the overall operation of the industry is relatively stable, and maintaining it is not easy. This is a common fact. Therefore, when talking about banking business today, it can be said that there is no easy path to follow. Aiming too high and being surprised by the distance is certainly not appropriate, but adhering to conventions may also be inadequate. There is no other way but to assess the situation, be realistic, strictly abide by regulations, be mindful of the difficulties of the times, and pay attention to assisting and promoting productive enterprises and seeking collective security in the financial industry. By following this path, even if we cannot achieve prosperity, we will not lose our sense of duty and may still be able to support each other and weather the storm together.</p>
<p>Loan Restrictions</p>
<p>In the past six months, all the laws and regulations that the association has forwarded and the public affairs it has handled for the industry have been aimed at encouraging each other. A total of 24 meetings of the board of directors, standing directors, joint meetings of banks and money shops, and various subcommittees have been held. During these six months, the government has promulgated more than ten laws and regulations related to financial affairs. The more important ones include the Ministry of Finance's strict ban on speculation in gold prices in Shanghai in June and July, reiterating the three measures for restricting loans by banks and money shops. The use of loans must be strictly reviewed. If they are used for speculation to drive up prices, severe punishment will be imposed. Instructions were forwarded, and all members were required to comply. The increase in capital of financial institutions should be submitted to the Ministry for approval in advance according to law. However, in the past, many banks did not submit applications in advance and had already published announcements in newspapers and convened shareholder meetings, which was not in compliance with regulations. The Ministry of Finance also instructed that the temporary measures for managing financial institutions must be followed, and severe punishment should be imposed.</p>
<p>Amended Measures</p>
<p>The temporary measures for managing financial institutions were implemented last year. This time, the Ministry of Finance made further amendments, the main points of which are: (1) Branch offices that have already been established by financial institutions must apply for registration within one month and obtain a separate business license. (2) The affiliated organizations of financial institutions' associations, such as joint reserve warehouses and clearing houses, should also apply for approval. (3) The amount of fines for violations of laws and regulations has been increased compared to the original regulations. The other implementing rules of the same law and the relevant articles of the bank registration charter have also been amended accordingly. Recently, in October, the "Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in Shanghai" was promulgated, the main purpose of which is to bring the financial industry into line with regulations and to restrict investment channels. Therefore, there are minimum numerical requirements for bank funds and deposits. The reserve ratio has been increased to 30%, and loans to shops and factories are also explicitly limited to 3 million yuan. In addition, there are strict provisions regarding the reporting of securities investments, total deposits, and the party affiliation of important financial institution personnel. Shortly thereafter, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office revised the measures based on the outline to facilitate implementation. Because the authorities have deep intentions, the industry has complied with the implementation of a part of them. However, at the beginning, because the time limit was very short, the banks and money shops themselves had some difficulties. Although they made gentle statements, hoping to achieve practical results, there were still some cases where things were difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Restructuring of Organizations</p>
<p>It was decided at the last general meeting that the internal organization of the association should be reformed to improve efficiency and integrity. Later, the board of directors and supervisors appointed a committee to form a small group to draft a plan. The main points of the organization are to abolish the original secretariat and establish two departments: general affairs and audit. Three research subcommittees on laws and regulations, business, and management will be established to assist the board of directors in promoting association affairs. After the personnel aspects are decided, the reorganization can be completed next spring. Taking advantage of the general meeting, I would like to submit a preliminary report."</p>

Those who attempt to evade this tax will be fined five to twenty times the tax amount. Each venue should present the certificate for inspection at any time when there is an inspection and must not refuse. The Municipal Police Headquarters specially ordered its subordinate branches to cooperate fully yesterday.</p>
<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>"Not a Penny" and "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart": Nearly One Million Yuan Donated Yesterday, Hope to Continue Efforts</h3>
<p>"Commodity scholarship, the most profound meaning." This means that industrial and commercial enterprises each use their honorary products to recognize teams and donate happily, leaving a deep impression on people's minds, forever unforgettable, benefiting themselves and others. In the past month, various factories have been promoting this, and there have been many precedents. Yesterday, Liang Xin Ji Toothbrush Factory recognized the "Not a Penny" team. These four words were originally a promotional slogan of Rong Xin Ji, but it is quite "humorous"; it seems to allude to the general rich people on the sea who squander privately and live extravagantly, but when it comes to social welfare, they "do not give a penny." There are indeed many such people. In fact, it is also quite pitiful. No matter how rich your family is, in the end, it is still a dream! A few days ago, New Star Pharmaceutical Factory recognized the "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart" team. These four words are exactly the opposite of "Not a Penny." At that time, Mr. Yao Junzhi said that "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart" is ready to sacrifice without limitation. Even if there are a thousand or even ten thousand people who donate 50,000 yuan per team, they will still donate. His generosity is admirable! I hope that people who "do not give a penny" can also change their style, keep their word, donate more, accumulate more, so that five thousand children and countless poor children will not drop out of school, they will all have books to read, and our scholarship movement will finally succeed. That is really "Deeply Pleasing to My Heart."</p>
<p>Hong En Hospital Nurses Help Students</p>
<p>The Hong En Hospital Nurses Team sent a letter to the nursing community yesterday for the scholarship movement, saying: "Dear sisters in the nursing community: We feel great joy and excitement because we have been able to do our part in the scholarship fundraising movement enthusiastically advocated by the newspaper. Although our strength is small, it contains the hard work of cooks, workers, and engine workers. The enthusiasm of patients, a loving mother blessing her young daughter to recover early in the "Ming Jue Team." Filial sons and daughters, blessing their loving mother to recover healthy in the "Health Team," may everyone in the world follow their enthusiasm! Our nursing community is not very noticeable in social welfare undertakings. Only in movies are we often made the protagonists of love stories, which is not clear enough. We hope that our nursing sisters will actively participate in the Shen Bao scholarship movement to give full play to the spirit of nurses serving the society."</p>
<p>Silk Industry Bank Saves to Help Students</p>
<p>China Silk Industry Bank wrote: "We respectfully inform you that your newspaper has been organizing scholarships to help outstanding young people and poor children in this city for many years, and your efforts have been great. After admiring you, our colleagues at the bank cannot help but sympathize, so we have strived to save from our private lives and accumulated savings of 200,000 yuan. In addition to sending half of it to the News Newspaper, we are sending only 100,000 yuan and ask that it be included under the scholarship fund. Although the small amount is like a drop in the bucket, if colleagues in the city enthusiastically respond, the amount will surely be considerable."</p>
<p>Scholarship funds received yesterday: Sheng Xianqiao (my humble wife had a difficult childbirth and finally recovered safely, willing to give alms to repay God's grace) 10,000 yuan, Qian Gongxia (responding to Mr. Yang Guangzheng's "Beggar Team") 2,000 yuan, Chen Bainian 1,500 yuan, Shen Baorong, Wang Zhengde Tang, Xu Xuying 1,000 yuan each, Students of the Second Primary School of Shumin (saving New Year's cards) 235 yuan, Hu Luxin Xiang 200 yuan, Hu Shanpei, Song Xiuyuan, Pu Jiting 100 yuan each, total storage notes received 17,235 yuan, balance 7,118,458 yuan.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Rice Sold Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the household rice, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has instructed the rice merchants in the old First District and the newly merged areas of West Shanghai to handle the shipment procedures. This has now been completed, and it is scheduled to be sold from the 30th of this month to the 13th of January of the 34th year. Holders of the 34th comprehensive distribution certificate can purchase rice from designated rice retailers at a price of 97.5 yuan per certificate for one and a half liters, calculated at 65 yuan per liter. Expired certificates will be voided and will not be resold. We hope that citizens will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Training Institute Students Hold Graduation Ceremony; Japanese Army Air Defense Commander Observes</h3>
