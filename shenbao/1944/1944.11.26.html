<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大本營二十五日下午三時三十分發表：菲律賓方面日軍航空隊，冒惡劣天氣，於二十二·三兩日猛攻摩羅泰島敵機塲及雷伊泰灣內敵艦船，二十四日猛攻雷伊泰泰島敵機場及登陸地點等，所獲戰果如次：（一）摩羅泰島中彈起火者二十五處以上，爆炸者二十處以上。（二）雷伊泰灣擊沉運輸船二艘，登陸用舟艇兩艘，擊毀驅逐艦一艘，運輸船一艘。（三）雷伊泰島中彈起火者九處以上（內一處大爆炸）。日機損害：自炸一架，未歸者十七架。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地二十五日中央社電　日空軍戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，二十二日夜半奇製摩羅泰島敵機場，突破敵熾烈防空爽快火，投下巨彈多枚，機場滑翔路及掩護體二十數處起火，日機全部歸還。二十三日夜，再以戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，强襲該島，予以重創後，全機安返。此次攻擊戰果，計炸毀及焚毀敵軍設施二十餘處，大型機起火者五十二架，中型機起火者二十架，重創者二架，小型機起火者二架，此外並炸毀地上敵機多數。</p>
<p>菲島前綫日軍基地二十五日中央社電　日戰鬥機隊，二十三日上午冒惡劣天氣，空襲雷伊泰島，呼應日軍陸地都隊之猛烈進擊，除制掌加里加拉方面之上空外，更急襲敵據點之巴爾哥。又是夜日軍轟炸機隊再度進攻雷伊泰島，猛攻塔克羅班，塔克拉中間之敵軍登陸地點，全彈命中，對敵方探照燈陣地，物資堆積地，以及其他軍事設施，加以澈底轟炸後，全機安返基地。更於二十四日晨强襲雷伊泰島塔克羅班敵機場，對該機塲反覆施以痛烈之俯衝轟炸，除炸毀其滑翔路外，更使地上敵機四架起炸，使附屬施設一處大爆炸，於此次攻擊，日機一架未飛返。</p>
<h3 id="c2">雷伊泰島日軍　戰力已增強 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>菲律賓基地二十五日中央社電　雷伊泰日軍，正於該島古稜山脈東側高地構築堆壘，待增援部隊到達開始反攻。十一月初旬以來，日軍新銳增援軍已陸續開抵第一綫，日軍戰力頓形增强，敵軍終被迫採取守勢，兼之於登陸前後損失過重，故敵軍補給漸呈窘狀，然卡里加拉方面敵軍，仍積極增援兵力，圖獲得優勢地位。他方並使雷伊泰西岸巴帕之兵力北上，企圖遮斷奧爾莫克海岸之日軍補給綫，但日軍增援部隊已與守軍取得聯絡，對自卡里加拉來犯之敵軍加以迂迴包圑，將其擊退至海岸附近。</p>
<p>日決死隊炸敵坦克</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　雷伊泰之敵軍，長懼日軍之肉搏攻擊，積極利用戰車，日軍則編成戰事破壤決死隊與特別攻擊隊，樹立偉大戰功，決死隊勇士抱持具有特殊裝置重若千公斤之炸藥，以對抗戰車彈潛伏低地，俟敵戰車進於近距離內，則冒戰車砲火燃點炸藥之點火綫，急速向其致命部拋擲，而後退避，轉瞬間敵戰車即粉碎無餘，至隨戰車而進之敵兵，遭此不意，均惆悵狼狽，一意逃遁，日方衝鋒隊即衝鋒急進，斬兵殺將，結果敵軍均高舉兩手，低首降伏，日陸上特攻隊如是神出鬼沒，於雷伊泰戰綫各處活躍，實使敵軍胆怯心寒。</p>
<h3 id="c3">菲律賓東方海面　日空軍綜合戰果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十四中央社電　日航空部隊二十一日至二十三日所獲戰果及十九日之追加戰果，分誌如次：（一）二十一日之戰果，日航空部隊二十一日上午九時半左右，在民答那峨島東方海面攻擊敵空母羣（由數艘組成其中有運輸船），投彈命中敵制式空母一艘之中央部，敵空母當即停駛，作大傾斜，但日機轟炸後，即行急速退避，故該艦已否沉沒，未能確認，惟該艦沉沒之成分屬多，是役日機亦有二架未歸返基地。（二）二十二日之戰果，日航空部隊二十二日在斯爾安島東南海面攻擊敵運輸船團，以雷擊擊沉敵中型運輸船一艘，是役日機二架未歸還基地。（三）二十三日之戰果，日航空部隊，二十三日下午六時半左右，在民答那峨東方海面，冒密雲重疊之惡劣天氣，對巡洋艦，驅逐艦等護衛之敵運輸團，加以强襲，以魚雷命中敵大型運輸船一艘，將其擊沉，並以魚雷擊沉敵驅逐艦或巡洋艦一艘，是役日機一架未歸還基地。（四）十九日之追加戰果，日大營前於二十一日發表，日航空部隊十九日傍晚，在呂宋島東方海面轟炸敵機動部隊，所獲之戰果，計擊沉敵巡洋艦二艘，擊毀航空母艦一艘，戰艦一艘，嗣後更判明是役日航空部隊並曾擊毀艦型未詳之敵艦三艘，使之發生大火，預料該三艘敵艦均已被炸沉，且認該三敵艦多半爲航空母艦。又是役日方之損害，計有飛機八架未歸還基地，嗣後更判明復有一架亦未歸還，連前共計九架。</p>
<h3 id="c4">空襲東京敵機　墜傷十四架 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大本營二十五日上午十一時五十分發表：關於二十四日敵機來襲東京附近日軍所獲戰果，其後判明者如次：擊落五架（包括二十四日發表者），其中一架爲拚撞擊落者，又敵機受有損傷者九架。是役日機尚未歸還者七架（內包括拚撞機）。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　積極整頓對日空襲基地馬利亞納之敵美空軍，終於二十四日過午來襲東京附近，是日敵機以九千米乃至一萬米之高度，分作數梯圑，少則六架，多則十餘架，侵入東京郊外，一部並侵入東京上空。敵機因懼日方防空陣式之堅强，皆作輕裝備，所載之炸彈極少，而投彈量亦不多，加以日方防空陣式十分活躍，故日方之捐害極爲輕微，僅有數處發生小火，毫無問題，立刻即被撲滅。是役，日方之戰果，據發表截至午後五時，判明共擊落敵機三架，詳細戰果刻正調查中。此次敵機來襲目的，自然常看作爲破壞日方戰力之源泉，而大舉出動，然另一方面並含有政略宣傳之目的。敵美舊金山，在下午一時半（日本時間）敵機正空襲東京時，即廣播謂大舉空襲東京，刻正在猛炸工塲等設施。並謂，此次空襲係由馬利亞納基地及中國基地舉行夾擊作戰，此語全屬子虛，敵機出擊之基地，僅爲馬利亞納基地，由此以觀，其謀略空襲之意圖實可顯見。</p>
<h3 id="c5">來栖氏演說 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　來栖三郎氏於三年前之十一月二十六日，美國對日發出最後通牒時，身爲特命全權大使，担當日美交涉，二十五日下午七時，在霞山會館發表演說，題爲「外交不容苟且」，論述當時日本爲希望完成交涉，所作之種種努力及美國內主戰派作梗，經於二十六日發出最後通牒，企圖置日本於死地，遂行戰端，同時幷言及國際情勢謂，英美對斯達林議長所發表之演說，認爲蘇聯即將一變過去對日所持之中立態度，藉題大事宣傳，蓋英美此種手段，不過爲其慣技，殊無價值，吾人應始終冷靜，正視國際政局之現狀，更熟識國際間利害複雜關係。嗣幷指出敵英美陣營中所謂戰後案之如何虛僞，不澈底，最後幷謂，日本希望實現之世界和平，乃於世界廣泛實施大東亞共問實言之各項原則，依此所達成立足於正義之眞正世界和平？</p>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3 id="c14">誰是中國革命的領導者？ <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問：國民黨和共產黨現在仍在若斷若續地談判中，但他們究竟是否有可能合作呢？假如兩黨眞能合作時，則等於在中國革命史上，也可說是在全世界人類史上，將開一新紀元，正因爲意義如是重大，所以一般人一聽到國共又在談判，而就驚訝不置。此次談判，或許像往常一樣，仍歸決裂的吧！</p>
<p>答：正如所言，兩黨的談判，時時有決裂的可能。目前中國共產黨的實力，正規軍爲四十七萬人，民衆武力爲二百二十萬人。中國共產黨主張此一數字中應改繼爲五軍十六師，而國民黨則主張只應改編爲四軍十師人。一般人說，雙方意見的這種距離，就是此次國共談判停頓的主因。但我認爲國共談判的困難點並不在於這樣軍事間題上，而是在於國共兩黨對中國革命本質的理解不同上。唯其如此，雙方意見如果不能完全一致，則兩黨間的眞誠合作，是不會實現的。</p>
<p>問：中國革命的本質，究竟是什麼？</p>
<p>答：任何中國人都知道，中國革命問題。實質上就是農民問題。怎樣摧毀封建勢力和國際帝國主義的剝削和壓迫，而解放農民於倒懸。這就是中國農民革命的內容。而中國革命能否成功，就視農民參加革命與否爲轉移。自已「以芋和黍爲家常便飯，而從未吃過大米」的貪農子弟孫文，在一九二四年八月二十三日廣東「農民運動訓練班」上，曾向國民黨員大聲急呼地說過：</p>
<p>「我們的革命政府，是想創造以人民爲主體的國家。因爲農民在我國佔絕對大多數，假如農民不參加革命，則我們的革命就失去基礎。中國國民黨此次改組，使農民參加革命運動，就是想以農民爲基礎的。使農民成爲本黨的革命基礎，這就是諸君的責任。」</p>
<p>繼而他又解釋農民問題的目標說：「我們呶呶不休於農民問題者，就是想解決農民痛苦，而使耕者有其田的意思。主要目標，就在於使農民本身終年勞苦的血汗結果，不爲他人所奪這一點上。今曰農民終年辛苦的結果，農民只得到四成，而六成則被地主奪去。此外，政府的捐稅，並非全由地主緣納，而大部仍須農民獻出。中國這種現狀，實在不公平，而令人髮指。我們所處的這種黑暗而不合理的情况，在以前是不能公諸天下的，現在向大家公開宜傳的時機，業已到來了。現在我們所欲作的宜傳，是破天荒第一次。諸君旣是宣傳員，所以居心要誠懇，服務要勤勞，努力爲農民謀幸福……農民不聯合起來組成自己的堅强團體，是不會取得幸福的。爲使農民得到幸福，我希望諸君『到民間去』進行宣傳，使農民聯合起來。農民如能全體奮起而聯合起來，則我們的革命可立而待。」</p>
<p>這樣就可以輸廓地明瞭，中國革命即是農民革命了吧！國共兩黨對於這種農民革命的態度如不一致，則兩黨決不可能合作。</p>
<p>問：但指導中國革命者，並非農民，而是城市中的革命知識份子，而贊助中國革命者，是城市的資產階級，站在孫文的立場上說，特別是南洋的華僑。</p>
<p>答：中國的革命運動，最初自然是康有爲派和孫文派兩方並駕齊驅的。大家都曉得，康有爲是舊時代士大夫階級（Literati）的進步份子，而孫文是新興資產階級的代表，現代知識份子。當時國內，淸朝的專制獨裁政治業已登峰造極，而列强利用這種非民主政治，竟自開始向中國作領土的侵略和經濟的侵略，但中國的專制獨裁政治是無力抵抗這種列强侵略的。且在經濟上愈對列强讓步，而中國的財政愈加無辦法，於是只好日益加强對民衆的劍削，以補償國庫的龐天赤字。所謂民衆，就是佔中國百分之九十人口的農民。因此，農民的負擔加重，農村經濟陷於破產，於是如有在農民中揭竿而起者，則各地立刻嚮應。但知識落後的農民運動，只是反抗地方上的直接統洽者，而決未擴大到反對帝國主義侵略的全國人民鬥爭上去。職此之故，半殖民地國家，領導農民而走向反帝國主義鬥爭者，非城市的進步知識份子莫屬。最初，在這一鬥爭上，利用農民對滿淸專制政體的信仰，而企圖在滿淸專制政體之下，把國民的反抗情緒統一起來，以與帝國主義列强進行戰鬥者，這就是舊式知識份子康有爲一派人物。</p>
<p>問：康有爲不是想用歐美方法改革滿淸的專制政體麼？</p>
<p>答：當時城市資產階級對滿淸專制政體的信仰，遠不如農民。尤其是老早就與外國相接觸的廣東和上海的資產階級，並未想推翻專制獨裁的官僚政治，而自己來實行民主政治。甚至一八九三年的孫文，還去求見李鴻章，而提出什麼「上李傅相　」。凡讀過這封信的人，都知道孫文並不是天生的革命家。（固然，孫文的自傳中曾說：「我自從乙酉—一八八五年—中法戰爭失敗的那一年起，就立志『打倒滿淸，創立民國』」。但這一記載，的確大成問題，因爲相信一個人自傳是老實話，那就不免受人愚弄。誰都曉得，一個人記述自己的往事，總不免粉飾潤色，自圓其說。）</p>
<p>康有爲曉得此輩資產階級對滿淸的態度，而才瞭解滿淸決不能維持過去的專制政體。因此，他就想把專制政體首先改爲資產階級所喜歡的那種形式，想在開明的專制政體（所謂Ebkuggtebed　Desootism名義之下，統一農民及資產階級的信賴，藉此以防列强的侵略。</p>
<p>問：康有爲旣如你所說是誠心支持滿淸，而想使滿淸重新宣揚國威於天下，那末滿淸究竟爲什麼放逐了他呢？當時滿淸政府內部，旣然也有張之洞那樣人物想採用西洋文明，來鞏固滿淸的專制政體的，那末豈不是應當聯合起來麽？</p>
<p>答：誠如你所說，張之洞李鴻章輩的洋務運動與康有爲等的運動，曾想合流。而實際上在某一時期，甚至張之洞曾是滿淸政府內部的康有爲擁護者。</p>
<p>一口咬定滿淸未年的官僚，始終是贊助帝國主義侵略的一流，這種判斷不免過於單純而幼稚。如承認他們是這一流，則對於領導鴉片戰爭的林則徐，就無法解釋了。在中國首先與帝國主義結合的，是買辦資本，當最初買辦資本勢力尚弱時，官僚並不想和他們結合，反而官僚曾代表普遍的中華民族要求，而想驅逐帝國主義出中國。張之洞也是這樣的一們人，他曾想努力鞏固滿淸政府，因而他才認爲有採用歐美文化的必要，於是便自動發起洋務運動。然而當時他所非常担心者，就是怕普遍深入地採用歐美文化後，則維繫滿淸社會組織的儒學思想（即中國的國粹思想）會有澈底解體之虞。因此，他才在著名的「勸學篇」中，曾提出一個調停辦法：「中學爲內學，西學爲外學，以中學治身心，以西學應世事」。這正如日本明治維新時代的「和魂洋才」思想一樣，中國有一句簡單的話，即「中學爲體，西學爲用」。他認爲採用西洋文化固屬出於不得已，但如因此而消滅了中國的國粹思想儒學，則中國的統一即將破裂，社會組織亦將支雕滅裂。但中國儒學思想的主流，甚至對於這種「中學爲體西學爲用」的思想，都斥爲「非聖人之道」，「邪說異端，洪水猛獸」，而抨擊洋務運動爲「名教叛徒」，「士林敗類」。因此，康有爲即把孔子的大同學說來粉飾和點綴自己的理論，藉此想在中國開闢出一條思想的康莊大道，但很多的官僚，看破他的詐術，而便命其名曰「孔表西裏說」，這也是理所當然的事。康有爲把孔子的大同世界描畫成一種民主主義的國際，竟說出在這裏中國人與外國人自由雜婚，而在世界裏逐漸消逝了國家的界綫，全世界在一個公共政府之下團結統一着，婦女與男人平等，疾病老幼由國家保護，兒童不是父母的私有品，而是國家的公民等一類根本與過去儒學思想不同的學說。至於他的長徒，所謂康有爲的顏回梁啓超，更前進了一步，甚至連孔子也加以排擊了。梁啓超曾經說過下面的一段話：「我請言心之奴隸種類！次再論所以之道！一曰：勿爲古人之奴隸。古聖賢，古豪傑，皆　有大功德於一羣，我輩宜愛而敬之。雖然，古人之所以爲古人，我之所以爲我，彼古人之所以能爲聖賢豪傑者，豈非爲自我手？否則，有聖即無後聖，有一傑即無再傑。例如孔子誦法堯舜，我輩誦法孔子。亦會思及孔子之所以能爲孔子，蓋在於彼立於堯舜之外。如使孔子爲堯舜之奴隸，則百世之後，必不再有孔子·」</p>
<p>這樣康有爲一派的言論，當時曾如何引起國粹派的憤慨，是可想像而知的。我並不認爲當時的官僚和士大夫階級是「帝國主義一流」。當時官僚等反而感覺到康有爲才是「帝國主義的一流」，而曾加以反對。例如曾任張之洞私人秘書的辜鴻銘，曾解釋他們反對康有爲的理由如下：</p>
<p>「中國的士大夫階級和普通人民，全都半斤八兩地是棑外份子和反對份子。後者或許尤甚。在中國旣不排外而又不反動的唯一階級，就是藉國外貿易而發財的買辦和暴發戶。因此，一般人民都起而反對康有爲的急進破壤主義（Jacobinism亦譯作雅各賓主義）。因爲康、有爲的急進破壞主義，是想把中國全部實行歐化。………因此一般人民，當看到外國人和列强公然援助康有爲的急進破壞主義——一般人認爲這種主義帶來了醜惡和恐怖的妖怪——的時候，便怒髮冲冠地站起來，把康有爲輩靈魂上所覆蓋着的醜惡和恐怖的妖怪，以及僑居在中國的所有外國人，投諸汪洋大海，使之葬於魚腹，這自然是勢所必然的事。這種立塲，就是義和圑事件狂暴的內在原因。</p>
<p>由此，也就可以明瞭張之洞派反對康有爲派的理由。同時，也就可以知道，連張之洞的洋務運動都斥爲「名教叛徒」和「士林敗類」的人，是會如何抨擊過康有爲。這批人的抨擊，雖有反動與進步之分，但當時中國人的大部份，正如日本明治維新時的「尊王攘夷」運動上所體騐者相同，都曾有澎湃汹湧的憤慨情緒。這種憤慨激昂的情緒，轉向滿淸政府爆發時，才完成了辛亥革命的偉業。把此種民族情緒引向反對滿淸者，按階級說，是城市資產階級，按領導人說，是孫文先生。</p>

<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社：西綫南翼之局勢仍未穩定，美第七軍之美法坦克車隊於突入薩伯恩（Zabern）低地後，向東南略有進展，其前鋒已進入斯特拉斯堡（Strasbourg），該處激戰正在進行中。反軸心軍進入亞爾薩斯中部之地區，仍屬狹小，惟巴樞將軍勢必企圖擴大之，大致向南作迅速之行動，以便與進入聖陶之法第一軍取得聯絡，以鉗形行動向萊因河推進，如此則佛日區之德軍有被圍之虞。惟法第一軍現正自顧不暇，是否能執行此項任務，尚成問題。德軍防綫現雖較流動性，但仍能粉碎敵方之包圍計劃，美第七軍即能迅速向斯特拉斯堡推進，亦不能戰勝此役，因此後之發展將與英軍突破尼美根後之局勢相同。</p>
<p>亞琛前綫大戰方酣</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　西綫戰局焦點一變再變，刻仍集中亞琛地區，伺機侵入魯爾工業地帶之英美軍亦極力蠢動。德元首行營亦確認以上報告大致無誰，據云，過去一週間於亞琛區之戰鬥，英美軍計喪失戰車三百二十輛，兵員至少二萬人。又向科隆前進中之美第九軍，刻進抵萊因河西方之雷爾河谿谷，正向距科隆的二十六公里前進。又西綫南翼作戰中巴頓麾下之美第三軍，刻正於梅茲地方與德軍交戰，其一部份到達薩爾勃魯根八十五公里之地點，另一隊刻於薩爾勃魯根東方突破亞爾薩期·洛林之綫。統觀上述之西綫戰局，實不能不認爲德軍不利。</p>

<h3 id="c32">第二神風攻擊隊 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>當聯合艦隊司令長官將第一神風特攻隊敷島隊在斯魯安洋面盡壯建立的偉勵布告全軍時，海軍全體一面感激決戰中的菲律賓方面航空隊將士，一面決心擊滅仇敵，士氣更加旺盛。在這以前，組成神風特攻隊的消息一度傳來後，海軍航空部隊全體將士，認爲此乃達到宿願的良機，都願加入特攻隊，爭光恐後地願意實行敢死的攻擊。這樣，第二特別攻擊隊便在二十七日舉行命名訣別的莊嚴儀式，從基地出發上陣。</p>
<p>出發訓示</p>
<p>二十七日午前十時，在菲島海面海戰中受到日軍海空雙方的猛攻而瀕於潰滅的敵艦隊，糾合殘存艦艇，頑强接近，以圖掩護雷伊泰島上的陸軍。日本海軍航空部隊，不分黎明，白畫，薄暮，夜晚，毫不休息地相繼從菲島航空要塞出發……連續攻擊，使敵軍述喘氣的機會也沒有。基地上，授報與出發交錯雜作，敵機動部隊與雷伊泰灣內的船舶，相繼葬身海底。在這緊張熟烈的當兒，第二神風特別攻擊隊却悄然出發了。某地上空，飛翔着出擊的友機，司令長官在本部召集身穿飛行服的隊員，莊嚴地舉行命令書傳達式。在緣茸地上，以K司令爲中心，隊員整齊地列成隊伍。他們的隊長是二十五歲的〇〇大尉，他們都是預科練或飛練出身，年紀最小的還祗十九歲。未幾，司令長官走到台上，壯士的臉一齊向着長官。</p>
<p>『昭和十九年十月二十七日令</p>
<p>茲令某基地航空部隊指揮官K司令所卒航空隊組成特別攻擊隊，任〇〇大尉爲隊長。該隊命名如左：</p>
<p>全隊名：第二神風特別攻擊隊</p>
<p>各隊名：「忠勇」，「義烈」，「純忠」，「至誠」，「誠忠」』</p>
<p>命令傳達書由司令長官親手交下。忠魂留芳千載的第二次神風特攻隊，於是誕生。隊員們直立不動，瞬也不瞬。接着，長官向他們作訣別之辭。</p>
<p>「臨戰不期生還之類，敵人也能做到，但一開始就準備捨命完成自己的使命，那是他們辦不到的。發揚這種偉大的精神力，透露這種崇高至純的犧牲心，這才不愧是神國神兵！現在，各位都已做到，正是神兵中的神兵！」</p>
<p>長官的眞切訓詞，句句有力，完全出諸肺腑。隊員的表情，堅毅緊張，好像一尊一尊的塑像。長官繼續說着，聲音更高。</p>
<p>「各位出發征途，必能達到目的！各位的忠勇義烈，純忠至誠，不二偉勳，皇上也會感動的，而各位的父母，不管今日在不在人世，也會衷心欣慰的，一億同胞，更會感謝激動。本職深深期待着各位！」</p>
<p>訣別之辭終了。不久，長官又鎭靜地用鄭重的口調說道：「現在來喝一杯餞別的酒吧！」長官以下各幕僚眞誠的別宴，　在廣塲的一隅。翠綠的林蔭下，舖着白布的桌上，置列酒僎，長官以下，幕僚，司令，副長，飛行長及隊員，相向國立桌旁。</p>
<p>「乾一杯，恭祝出發，並祈成功！」長官高舉酒杯，各隊員的杯中注滿神酒，含笑一飲而盡。這一瞬間，指揮官和隊員的心，合而爲一。時候　早，各隊部拍了一次最後的紀念攝影。送別者含淚送行，就征者含笑出發。於是在日本光榮的歷史上又添了新的一貫。</p>
<p>百發百中</p>
<p>此日出　的神風第二特攻隊，以隊長〇〇大尉爲指揮官，統率分隊長〇〇大尉以下忠勇，義烈，純忠，至誠，誠忠各隊，另由A大尉統率直　戰鬥機隊，担任　　工作。</p>
<p>午後二時三十分，等待出發的各架飛機，翼下裝好必中的炸彈，在列綫上開始發動。隊長〇〇大尉帶領各隊員整列於指揮所前。在啃雜的飛機聲中，〇〇大尉朗然作出發的報告，聲音裏充滿了必勝的信念。祖國的興　，正在此一戰！</p>
<p>「現在，我們　掉性命，出發執行攻擊敵方航空母艦的光榮任務。」</p>
<p>K司令聽取這個報告以後，祗莊重地激勵大家道：</p>
<p>「有勞了，好好的幹！」</p>
<p>這時，司令的眼中，閃着股望的光。其後，飛行長指明關於攻擊方針的各要點，然後，由〇〇隊長向隊負作最後的訓話：</p>
<p>「大家如果因爲是赴死去而不留心敵方戰鬥　等，那才火錯特錯。對於戰門機，雖然有我們的直掩隊來對付，但在擅到敵軍機動部隊以前，我們應該小心保全自己。如果沒有飛到敵艦上空就死掉，那是白死！所以對於敵方戰鬥機，仍舊要戒備。仔細守　着！」</p>
<p>隊員一齊頷首。未達目的斷不死，找到目標時，那就要拚死向敵艦撞去。他們之要保全生命，祇在於要求死得其所！</p>
<p>這樣，數刻之後，「啊，去吧！」隊員一齊向座機跑去。途中，拍着擔任掩護工作的戰鬥機員，笑着拜託道：</p>
<p>「喂，請你看好我最後的樣子哪！」</p>
<p>之後，將吸着香烟隨便丟在地上，用飛行靴一路踏，快步向飛機走去。</p>
<p>神風第二特攻隊，自指揮官以至隊員，正如平日的訓練一樣，從容不迫地，一架，二架，三架，魚貫出發，飛離不再回來的基地。司令長官，K司令，飛行長和整備員等，揮着白巾。各機在上空組成堂堂的編隊，環繞基地一周，然後向東方飛去。直到機影消失在遙遠的地方，誰也不移動一步。K司令一直在基地上垂着祈禱「任務必成」。</p>
<p>「以肉彈兮起神風，斷然而行兮鬼神肅避！」正和這種信念一樣，盡忠的戰果，帶到了基地司令部。神風特攻隊殺到　伊泰灣及菲律賓東方海面，紛紛命中敵艦，建立大功（小野田報道班員）（譯自十一月二日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 儀宣</p>
<p>我不常乘車子，除了十分遙遠的路，我都是安步當車。但去署中一場大病之後，體力大衰，每天早晨赴校，不得不乘電車代步；有時挾了畫具。在擁擠的車廂中，眞是莫大的累贅，簡直比步行還要費力；這時，常有一位和藹的老人起來讓坐；後來幾乎成了常例，假使我沒有坐位的話；我是十二分的感激着，但我除了一聲輕微的「謝謝」外，我只能凝視着他蒼蒼的白髮，在心中至誠地祝謝着。</p>
<p>我們在同一個站頭下車，我往往隨在他的身後，瞧他傴僂着身軀，雙手揷在蔽舊的大氅袋裏，遲緩地一步步走進我學校附近的墓園。</p>
<p>墓園是何等凄凉的一個地方，在潔白的墓石下，不論躺着的是驚才抑絕艷，現在都和凡夫俗子一般腐蝕了軀殻。這要聽不見歡悅的笑語，看不見愉快的神容；雖然也有蒼翠的樹木，鮮艷的花草，但是却沒有一絲生氣，小鳥的歌聲也充滿了寂寞悲慘的情調；這裏只有盈盈的淚眼，嚶嚶的啜泣。老人爲什麼每天不間斷地去呢？難道裏面樓着他的親人嗎？於是我從敬仰之外，又加上了同情。</p>
<p>是微雨的深秋之晨，陰沉的天，好像一塊龐大的鉛塊，灰黯得毫無生氣；胸膈聞感到異常的窒悶，精神也很恍惚，似乎有一些薄愁，也有一些輕怨；車中比往日更擁擠，到目的地時車還沒有停，門已開了，我站立在門口，等待它的停止；不料，偶然一顧，我幾乎向前傾下，這時，一只手臂攔住了我；當我略略凝神，預備向後道謝時；鴦然，這正在收回手的，使我驚呼起來；那手除了一段大姆指外，光光的只是一片扁平的肉板。我呆木的靠在車壁，也忘了舉步，我發現這就是那位老人的右手；在這驚呼的剎那，我接觸到他和善的眼光，同時也聽到一聲微微的嘆息；這一瞥一嘆中，有傷感，有譴責；雖然我不知道他失指的原因，但是殘廢是件多麼痛苦的事，對於一個年老的殘廢者，我怎可如此孟浪地近乎失禮的對待。</p>
<p>我很想趕上前去向他道歉，求恕；可是我沒有這樣做。整天的心緒是在不安中，隨時我都會想像起一個老人，躑躅在基道間，痛惜他失去的一切；這樣撩人愁思的天氣，再加上坎坷不平的命運，不堪回首呵！可憫的老人！</p>
<p>接連幾天，我故意提早出門，我慚愧我的無禮，我不敢再接觸那對鹿樣的和善的眼珠；但即使這樣，並不能使我的心靈復安，相反的，這印象却日甚一日地在心頭作痛。</p>
<p>「孩子，這裏坐吧！」我又重逢他了，當我剛上車，發現他時，我不覺屏住了氣，低垂下頭，把背向着他；但是他的左手還是按上了我的肩，我仰頭向他道謝時，從他親切的俯視中，我知道他已宥恕了我。</p>
<p>學校生活是一泓靜靜的溪水，偶然投入一片小石，就會漾起圈圈連漪，因此來年元旦全市中學將聯合舉行畫展的消息；是怎樣的瘋狂了我們；人人都聚精會神地在構思，如何創造一件偉大的作品榮獲那金質的獎章。</p>
<p>碧草已盡枯黃，除了一些常綠樹外，都成了禿的枝枒，自然界呈現的全是冬天的景象。同學們都開始緊張工作，只有我的書架上還是一張白紙；我不願畫一幅平凡的畫，白費了時光，心血，我的心理是狂謬得可笑，就是我必須獲得那冠軍的榮譽，雖然我的成續僅僅是只能稱雄本校。經過了兩星期的考慮，我決定作了一幅墓園的寫生，我要傾我的全力去完成它。</p>
<p>第二天，我懷着極度的希望，踏進了那悽寂的園地，在無數直立的十字架中，我肅然環觀四周，預備找一個適宜作畫的地點。</p>
<p>前面有一個婦人跪在墓旁哭泣，離她不遠，又有一個男十正在默默地獻花；我迅速安置了好畫具，聚精會神地工作着，傍晚我已畫好整個輸廓；但是我仔細地看看，總覺得成績並不如理想那樣的完美，天已將黑，我祗得收拾起，明天再繼續來畫。</p>
<p>次日，我整天用心修改那張畫稿。而總不能如意；懊惱之下，我似乎感到後面有人，回頭一望，原來竟是那老人。</p>
<p>「失敗了嗎？」他很溫和的問我：「是的，」我緊縐着眉。</p>
<p>「你忘了一件東西了！」</p>
<p>「什麼東西啊！」我翻撿着畫匣，我並沒忘了什麼。</p>
<p>「你忘了把你的情感放進去了！因此你的畫只成了沒有靈魂的彩紙！」「情感？」</p>
<p>「是的，情感是藝術的靈魂，常你聽到一曲精彩的樂曲時，你能隨着它的音節喜樂，或哀怨；同樣，一幅成功的圖畫，也能表達出作者的情緒與思想，而控制人們；你爲什麼要到這裏來寫生，你是否要啓示人們，這裏是一個悲慘的地方，這裏吞噬了許多人的親愛者，把他們隔絕在兩個世界裏，留下了切骨的相思，痛心的哀慟，但你並沒把這情緒畫進去，你只畫下了一些呆板的形象呵！」</p>
<p>我恍然大悟，同時我不由十分崇敬他的智　，我素來以爲他只是一個可憐的墓園看守者；然而現在，我才感到自己是微　般的渺小。</p>
<p>夕陽西墜，寒鴉紛紛歸巢，西風刮動着枯枝，似乎在替世界奏着寂寞之歌。我望着面前鱗比的十字架，老人緩步在墓道間，時常俯身恰起那些祭者所獻的已枯萎了的花束。</p>
<p>我靈感突起，奮然重整畫紙，呵着凍僵的手指，再開始工作。</p>
<p>自此，我每次作畫時，老人總時常指點我；我的心中也萌起了懷疑，幾次我詢問他：「你一定學過畫吧？」「沒有沒有，一他一面搖頭，一面走得遠遠的。</p>
<p>我的盡終於完成了，師長們都交口稱贊，同學們都投出了妒羨的目光，我自己也是滿懷的得意。</p>
<p>展覽會開幕時前日，我從另一個有墓園的年靑人那裏，探得了他的住址：他住在一間幽暗的氣樓裏，我推門進去時，他驚喜得睜大了兩眼向我望着，頰上有着火樣的紅暈，我撫着他灼執熱的額角，焦急使我忘了一切慰問的話。</p>
<p>「坐一會吧！我很想來參觀你們的展覽會，但是我的病終不見好。」那聲音是低得如蚊鳴。</p>
<p>「明天我們將決賽了，我很希望你來呢！」</p>
<p>「我也渴願能來，你知道美術是我的生命，可是我……」他噤住了口。這時，我立刻注意到牆上掛了許多畫框；我情不自禁地走前去欣賞，那筆致的蒼勁，佈局的獨特，處處都顯得不是出自平凡的手筆。</p>
<p>「這些是誰的作品？」我回頭問老人，他却閉了雙目，不作一詞；突然，我領晤：這也許是老人的作品，就在這時，我發現了一幅畫的下角，有「林郁」兩字。</p>
<p>這熟悉的名字吸引了我，終於我脫口低呼：「唔！林郁！」「怎麼你認得他？」是老人無力的聲浪。</p>
<p>「他是我叔父的同學，我常聽得叔父談起他，是一個天才的畫家。」</p>
<p>「天才的畫家……」老人喃喃自語，臉上透露了似乎怨憤的神氣，眼中射出了奕奕的光芒：「天才沒有金錢與權勢的抉植，他只有沒落。」</p>
<p>「你也認識也？」我故意試探：</p>
<p>「是的，」他又閉上了眼：「他完了！窮逼迫着他，爲了妻子的生產費，他不得不上工廠作工，結果機器軋去了他的手指，妻子又流產死了了，他孤獨地飄流在人間，成天看守在妻子的墓旁……」</p>
<p>「林郁是你！……」我驚呼着。他的嘴角起了痙攣，下陷的眼眶裏，不斷地湧着淚水。</p>
<p>「但是你爲什麼不開展覽會？」好久，我想出了這麼一句話。</p>
<p>「唉！你還年靑，你不懂得這是一個勢社會，我沒有大量的金錢，作自我的宣揚，又沒有赫赫的名人，替我吹噓；我又不願爲了物質的缺陷，而向人乞憐，侮辱了神聖的藝術………完了！我早就完了！」</p>
<p>我似在夢中般的昏昏然，不過，我知道這是一個現實的夢。</p>
<p>室中漸漸的黑暗，人與物都　了模糊的影子。</p>
<p>「你可以回去了！」他的聲音更微弱：「回去吧！不要向任何人識起我，我生平最不願得別人的憐憫。」</p>
<p>我仍站在原處不動，手：「明天我也許會好起來。」</p>
<p>一直到次日下午決賽時，我的心緒始終還在紊亂的狀態中。我不相信社會對一個藝術家是如此的殘酷，同時，我還在思索，怎樣救濟這潦倒的老人；我的軀殼是在展覽會內，但是我的神志却　得很遠。我似乎聽到有人在高呼我的名字，我還是茫茫然，及至局圍的同學都在催促我，我才如夢初醒的站立了起來。</p>
<p>我倒底達到了目的，那金質的獎章是掛在我的襟上了！「這不是我的榮譽，這是林郁賜予我的。」</p>
<p>散會後，我用最快的速率趕到老人處，房內仍如昨日的寂靜；我躡足走近他的床邊，他安寗地躺着，我抑制不住內心的喜悅，我要把這喜悅分給他</p>
<p>我輕輕握起他的手，正待呼醒他，然而他的手已是石般僵硬；我只覺得有一股澈骨的冷氣，沁入了我的心！凍凝了我的血………</p>

<p>— 聞蘭亭</p>
<p>夫追懷明德，或異代而同悲，景企英賢，亦殊邦而共愴；矧在同洲之國，篤生命世之豪，見養勇爲，以布衣而行俠，新鄰善友，亦肝膽而論交，緬援助之前勞，實裨益於我國者乎！日本頭山滿翁，東邦之　宿也。以在野黨魁，爲四朝元老。溯其創設玄洋社，以糾集靑年，發行福頌新聞，以宣傳主義，奔走國事，大黨不表，固已三島共知，四鄰交頌焉。獨其五十年中，扶助我國革命，協贊先烈成功，任俠肫誠，尤足感念。初我國父自倫敦蒙雞後，東渡日本，即與翁相往來，嗣同盟會成立於東京，爲重建革命策源地，日本朝野贊助者多，忩尤爲左右光後。及辛亥起義成助，國父歸自海外，忩亟走滬上迎之，嗣是我國志士，凡赴日謁翁者，殆無不聆其敎言，受其指導。故万諸我國古人，則容納亡命，廣柳載車，其游俠似魯失家縞紵獻酬，吳鄰通驛，其交誼似乎公孫僑却秦功，成千金芥，視其高義，又似魯仲連焉。今聞翁卒於本年十月六日。享年九十，念重洋之浩瀚，　戰方　，期兩國以　　，老成遽謝，昔延陵宿草，魯司寇過而書碑，徐君云亡，吳公子爲這掛劍，彼皆生非同國，感慕風徽，累行述情，庶可援例，乃罰誄曰：</p>
<p>「　歟滿翁，東國耆　，士流先進，國父摯友，人合鑄金，望如瞻斗，胡不百年，遽聞撒手。維新以前，生於福罔，不營仕宦，在野名揚，翁集同志，有勇知方贐期報國，志切尊王。東亞同盟，大倡主義，思聯兩國，終始一致。惟我國父，救亡國治，所見略同，針芥投契，畢生革命，頻厯東　·雜　奔走，賴翁經營，國父升遐，喪志入冥，翁來執紼，老淚縱橫。人謀鬼謀，邦交錯迕，兄弟風絡，執　外侮，幸有明　，　繆　戶，誼協同盟，東亞自主，大　軒然，海水　飛，勝券可　，晨光　微，主義　澈，　日重　，翁不主持，九　遽虧。翁歸九原，名在　舊，九十遐齡，一生奮歸，繼志有人，承先不貿，生榮死哀，感動鄰右，時難孔棘，如風　　，海上追悼，畢來英髦，念忩功業，一工人　，友邦哀思，我亦　陶。」</p>
<h3 id="c36">記頭山滿先生 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 丁默</p>
<p>一提起頭山滿先生，世間凡是稍稍知道一些東亞事情的人，一定都聽到過那位大名鼎鼎的人物。</p>
<p>頭山滿先生不僅是日本皇國國的發揚人者，而且是東亞革命之友。</p>
<p>頭山滿先生在世九十年，自安政二年（即一八五五年）誕生以來，亙明治，大正，昭和三代，他的一生，可說是近代日本興建史。日本國家之所以能有這樣强盛，領袖東亞，揚威世界，頭山滿先生在廣大社會層中鼓吹推動之力，其功實不可沒。</p>
<p>他在幼小時代，便懷大志。他反對藩閥政治，他又不滿明治維新以後專制傾向的政治形態，而介導民治運動。不過他一面介導民權，一面仍主張尊重皇室，保持日本國家傳統的性格。他在當時所領導的有名的玄洋社，便標榜着這樣的三大綱領。</p>
<p>（一）尊重皇室</p>
<p>（二）發揚國威於海外</p>
<p>（三）尊重民權</p>
<p>頭山滿先生實是日本國家主義運動的　祖，他結合一般社會的有力分子，從事作發揚日本皇國國威的活動，宣揚大亞洲主義，其大本營便是當初田福罔同鄕諸同志所糾合的女洋社。玄洋社在日本國家運動史上。是佔有極重要的地位，於中日·日俄兩次戰役中，玄洋社不少同志　身給國家，建立了很大功綫。玄洋社又人才迭出，現今成爲日本重臣的前首相廣田弘毅，就是頭山滿先生得意門生，而現任內閣情報局總裁國務大臣緒方竹虎等，也都是玄洋社出身的人物。</p>
<p>頭山滿先生的胸　寬大，門下徒遍全國，以至東亞各地。他非常崇拜明朝呂新吾所說的「大其心答天下之物，虛其心容天下之善」的話，而立爲格言。他又認爲一個人的心，應該也能够像一個人的身體脫裸出來，主張以德以誠服人，可以想見他的氣槪。這也正他之所以能够吸收大批志士於門下的所在。</p>
<p>頭山滿先生並且喜歡漢學，崇拜孔子孟子，所以他又是個學者。他是很同情中國的，國父孫中山先生從事革命的時候，曾經得到他不少的帮助、領袖汪先生於生前也常求敎於他</p>
<p>頭山滿先生不僅於對中國，對於東亞其他國家的革命運動，也莫不予以極大的支持。印度志士比哈利鮑斯亡命日本的時候，也是　着頭山先生的保庇，而始得無事。</p>
<p>這樣一位巨人，現在竟棄我們而長逝了。據產日本人士聞頭山先生之死，無不如接慈父之　，恕東亞各地人士聞之，也必有同感。</p>
<p>頭山先生在世時，一生都以在野之身盡瘁於國事，則死時一直無冠無位，眞是世間所少有。</p>
<p>頭山先生於本年九月二十七日曾對相知者書贈「忠勇義烈」，「皇運長久」，這已成了頭山先生的絕筆了。</p>
<p>聽說門徒廣田弘毅，範方竹虎，宮川五郞三郞等將　頭山先生出傳記，　傳記跟以前已出版過的極不相同，內容多爲頭山先生前口述的事，自屬珍貴得很。書名擬定爲「頭山忩正傳」，此書一出，頭山先生的一身，必可詳細公之於世了。</p>
<h3 id="c37">追悼頭山滿先生 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 陳日平</p>
<p>頭山滿先生，盟邦碩彥，黨國良朋，身居草野，心存匡濟，洞幾燭微，遠念長圖，數十寒署，致力不懈，聲聞遐邇，名重公卿，社結玄洋，人爭趨之，當國父提倡革命，創造民國之初，先生針芥相投，傾心翊贊，吾華朝野，莫不感佩，亦因先生之高，乃知國父之大，偉哉先生，眞人傑也。</p>
<p>先生老而彌壯，　　强固，方期德與福鄰，期頤克享，詎值共榮觀成之日，竟爾遽喪老成，然而形骸雖隔，精神不朽，燦爛功業，永垂千古。</p>
<p>日平目幼負笈東　，營於鄕黨前　，獲聞先生緒論，心　往之，景仰無已，輙以末能恭親　欬，時引爲憾，豈意人天頓隔，安全套願未酬，追念哲人，泫然涕下。</p>
<p>導頭山滿先生</p>
<p>世界巨人，日本國土，中國革命之友頭山滿先生，已於十月四日在日本逝世了。享年九十，一身的精力與情感，用在愛日本，愛中國，愛東亞民族團結一致，驅逐敵美的戰事日趨激烈之際，先生竟溘然長逝，不能看到大東亞各民族的解放，我們覺得非當痛惜！大東亞戰爭正入艱苦奮鬥的階段，必勝基礎已經奠定，需要先生更多的策勵之時，先生竟與世長辭，我們覺得無限悲悼！曾經給予很多同情，寄陽很大希望的中國，至今尙未有很大進步，不幸發生中日事變，一部份人士，仍受英美的愚蒙，阻礙東亞民族的解放，使全面和平還須很大的勞力，想到了這些，我們對於先生之死，悲痛之餘，不勝其感慨！先生離開了人間，已有五十日，在上海的我們，今天纔來追悼，似乎遲了，其實不然，如此適足以說明我們悼念之深！</p>
<p>今天我們如此莊嚴的追悼頭山滿先生。並非因爲他是盟邦日本的偉人，國民外交上的點綴，是以中國人的眞情實感來追悼這位中國革命之友。因爲這樣，我們追悼頭山滿先生，應深刻的去認識創見的人格和思想，來反省，來增進中日兩國間的親善，那末，我們的追悼，才有意義，我們的追悼，才有收獲，頭山滿先生的一身事蹟，那些值得我們去理解和學習的呢？</p>
<p>第一是愛國思想。他一生的生活，同日本的主義的運動了，就在故鄕福罔縣，　合同志，組織玄洋社，以修習知識，鍛鍊身體爲宗旨，期能於有事之秋，獻身國家，在其門下，人材　出，當甲午，日俄戰爭時，活動甚力。後發　福頌新報，主倡大亞洲主義，從事實踐指導，一生奔走國事，　菌甚偉。然而他並不因爲對國家盡了忠誠，冀希得到國家的　禮厚祿。昭和三年（一九二八年）天　即位六　時，曾賜特賞，他惶悚地說：「眞不敢當！」　以說，眞正發揮了「救國是國人之天職，無功足言」的精神了。</p>
<p>第二是民族立場。他是一個愛國主義者，所以能認淸了誰是應該聯合的友軍，喊出大亞洲主義，大東亞戰爭展開後，又喊出亞洲人的亞洲口號，對付他早就認淸了的敵人—美國。協富蘇峯先生批評一部份日本人對美國的理解。犯了五侃誤會，惟有頭山滿先生始終沒誤會美國人是好人。因爲他有正確的民族立場，有崇高的民族自尊心，終於成爲日本的特異標誌，爲世界上所注意</p>
<p>第三是宏大　度。他是强烈的民族思想的日本人，然　　不是狹隘的民族主義者。他能認識「日本和中國是二　一的國家」，而以之方一貫的信念。所以對中國革命事業，無不傾力相助；對於中國革命志士，無不擔誠加愛，上自已故的國父和汪主席，下至我國要人，都有深厚的友情，而執禮甚敬。他所以能這樣偉大，是能把愛日本的情感，　越了國家範圍，去愛中國，愛東亞，精誠的實踐同生共死的精神。</p>
<p>最後，目前中國和日本是一條戰綫上的同生共死的戰友，需要我們去努力的事情很多，尤其在中日兩國的親善事業上，期待更股，頭山滿先生的信念，須要去發揮，須要去學習，這是我們今天追悼的意義。</p>

<p>申報盃籃球，自本週華聯藥廠之擊敗汕隊，大華之棄權於中北，形勢益覺明朗化。華聯尙除二仗，爲大華及中北，均屬難關，尙須視張　祥嚴又陵二君之調度，各隊員之努力焉。茲錄甲組本週之結果及值得一提之賽，略作評述，致乙組本週間並無重要比賽，下週則有乙一部之仁餘對　　，乙二部大華胖隊，中北逢伶友，悉爲爭奪冠軍之戰，必有一番劇鬥也。</p>
<p>本週甲組戰果</p>

<p>華兩勝V隊　三五－二八</p>
<p>大華勝明星　三〇－二六</p>

<p>華聯勝汕愉　三二－二五</p>
<p>仁餘同仁　警報未終場</p>
<p>二十四日（週五）</p>
<p>華影勝明星　二七－二四</p>
<p>中北勝大華　棄權</p>
<p>甲組最近形勢</p>
<p>上週值得評述者，應如下列四場。</p>
<p>華聯戰勝　汕隊敏捷</p>
<p>華聯與汕隊，尤爲球迷矚目之戰，本報臨時加價，亦所以嘉應於助學金也。按此戰賽前，以華聯可勝者爲多，結果不出所料。評華聯之勝，首在經騐，臨陣不亂，次爲戰術成功。此戰該隊採用人釘人制。其站立地位，始終能在一人一手之間，，此乃爲人釘人制最適宜之地位。　過逼近。旣易犯規，亦易騙過，站在一人一手之間，則可阻對方擲出之球，對方亦難竄進。致汕隊之林維聰陳淸江便絕少機會。於是汕隊遂不免失敗。致個人方面，論功行賞，全場中當以華聯吳成章爲最成功。也將入相，變方籃下不進之球，幾爲小吳一手包辦誠使華聯得唱捷歌之關鍵，一大功臣也。評汕隊之演出，其出手之快，旣悅人耳目，美麗淸淅，如是日林維聰之獲第一球，及陳淸江之二記竄入，均有神來之筆，妙不可喩。其所以見屈者，尙未爐火純靑之佳境，有時略嫌過火，有時則雖免過於忸怩。然以後起之軍，有此成續，實匪易易。稍加薰陶，前途未可限量。</p>
<p>仁餘同仁明日補賽</p>
<p>仁餘戰同仁，亦爲一場勢均力敵之戰。對于名位之争前，颇有关係故双方各出全力。按宣家班過去素以擅長于攻著，自神手宣俊抱病後，影響實力，適得陸大振來滬，參加該隊，于是得失之間，尙無多大關係。然本季成績之不見超然者，要亦以各球員俱受職業牽制，聯繫較少。仁餘隊在陳渭源管理余郇子指導下，逐有進境。是役兩隊殺得興起，形勢甚見緊張，不料仁餘以三十二對二十五佔先前，時間尙餘九分一五稍，以警報關係，能能繼續舉行。乃經當局商討，決定于明日（二十七日）六時一刻補賽，希兩隊隊員注意，準時到場。</p>
<p>華影得意明星敗退</p>
<p>華影在申報盃之戰績，　不及明星，故類多謂明，星可勝華影，不料華景以主將包松賈之由蘇州趕來助陣，軍心一壯。反之明星王鏡湖未能　滬，何孝光又避不臨場，進　陶紹生適虫外　　巧來　，參加比賽，終以得一　二，損失殊甚。而是戰筆影之各個隊員，均有正常之演出。王學武擲　　見順手，包松圓又見活躍，而能守住敵方之長，又爲取勝之大原因。明星旣以隊員缺席，復因范熙榮之四次犯規，其不敗者竄　矣。然于此賽中，我人　爲指導之重要。籃上半時休息時，曾聞錢旭滄予各隊員之指導，無微不至。結果各隊員均能照其所爲，果爾獲得勝利。</p>
<p>中北大華表演極佳</p>
<p>是役也，雙方始終在驚風駭濤中，表演可稱盡善盡善。大華對于陣容，極見調整，因其探人釘人，故完全對症下藥，選能力方高强，作對抗之策。唯鄙意大華之釘人，均嫌逼得太緊，如長加充足，固甚適合，唯以該隊有一二球員長力不逮，終至末能達于理想。中北之　作風，自有其處人折服之點，即爲怏及個人拔術超然，惜以各隊員之近況，俱見退化。沈聿恭本爲獲公　魂，奈其最近大約以球運不順，輙多掠圈而出之球，當係疏于練習之故耳。此戰，上半時大華發　自如，以十七對十勝。下半時中北突見恢復，震　猶作一拼之演出，乃後來居上。曾反勝五分之多，觀衆以爲可以　定勝局矣。不料大華　勇可　，　　各二十八平手，照　延長五分時　。開始未久，中北陳學崇與大華陸　　盡谷　小起衝突，裁判乃判三人離場。大華因調換乏人，不能續賽，乃被判人大華棄權，中北遂以二對〇勝。</p>
<p>下週華聯將　大華</p>
<p>下週三（二十九日）華聯將逢大華，爲最後二關之一關。觀乎大華與中北之役，固未可輕視。況楊家將邇來精神殊旺，楊叔老尤見興奮，遇此常勝軍，自必擬出奇矣，以博獲取好成績也。且有虛谷邃之中鋒，可爭吳成章以威脅，沈繼思在最顛峯狀態中，阻隊擲　之球，可稱全滬獨一。張邦倫亦有進憶，其卯上之成績，較足球爲成功，總之，華聯勝面固屬較厚，但亦將費去一番心血，且看華關運用如何妙計矣，當爲下週最值行欣賞一幕矣。</p>
<h3 id="c39">籃球學理述要（五） <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>（五）單手低傳法</p>
<p>單手低傳，比較手低傳法，用得更廣加而有價值者，乃的近傳之時，其傳出方法，除在傳出時，以一手稍移下球底捏球，用手腕力傳出之外，其他方法，槪與變手低傳法同；此種傳法，用在籃下。遇對方走近張開兩臂防守時，在其不留意中，迅將球在其臂下，傳與跑向投籃之同伴，尤其美妙。</p>
<p>（學）地反彈傳球</p>
<p>擊地反彈傳球，其價值與用處，日　廣大，並且無論在何種進攻方式，此種傳　苦　配合，進最　用者，　若在對方　近防守之時，或　　在　角時行之，尤其　　之於處騙對方；作向高處傳出，或投籃之後，使對方無從捉摸。</p>
<p>此種傳法，用雙手或單手行之均可，須視當時對方所站之位置而定，但大多數以雙手爲之；當傳與正在走前接球之同伴時，宜使球倒向後方「旋接」使球擊地後，反彈起之角度縮短，以便於接得。使球轉動之方法，係用兩母指將球向後向下壓轉而成；若欲使球擊地，反彈起之角度伸長，則與此相反，使球向前方旋轉；但無論　　遼近，傳出之球，須擊地反彈起，高及於接球者之腹間；球擊地之處宜在防守者之足傍，及其所張開之臂下；若對方站在二　遠以外防守，此迭切不可用，因易被其奪　也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Planes Brave Adverse Weather to Fiercely Attack Morotai Island and Leyte Gulf, Enemy Airfields, Ships, etc. Sustain Heavy Damage <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 25th: The Japanese Air Force in the Philippines, braving adverse weather, fiercely attacked enemy airfields on Morotai Island and enemy warships in Leyte Gulf on the 22nd and 23rd. On the 24th, they fiercely attacked enemy airfields and landing points on Leyte Island. The battle results are as follows: (1) Morotai Island: more than 25 locations hit and set on fire, more than 20 locations exploded. (2) Leyte Gulf: 2 transport ships sunk, 2 landing craft sunk, 1 destroyer destroyed, 1 transport ship destroyed. (3) Leyte Island: more than 9 locations hit and set on fire (including one major explosion). Japanese aircraft losses: 1 self-detonated, 17 not returned.</p>
<p>Frontline Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A combined formation of Japanese Air Force fighter-bombers made a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on Morotai Island at midnight on the 22nd, breaking through the enemy's intense anti-aircraft fire, dropping many heavy bombs, and setting fire to more than 20 places on the airfield's runways and protective structures. All Japanese planes returned. On the night of the 23rd, a combined formation of fighter-bombers again strongly attacked the island, inflicting heavy damage, and all planes returned safely. The battle results of this attack include more than 20 enemy military facilities destroyed and burned, 52 large aircraft set on fire, 20 medium aircraft set on fire, 2 heavily damaged, 2 small aircraft set on fire, and also many enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base on the Front Line in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese fighter squadrons, braving adverse weather, raided Leyte Island, echoing the fierce advance of Japanese land troops. In addition to controlling the airspace over Carigara, they also raided Balugo, an enemy stronghold. That night, Japanese bomber squadrons again attacked Leyte Island, fiercely attacking Tacloban, where all bombs hit the enemy's landing points in Tacloban. After thoroughly bombing the enemy's searchlight positions, material storage areas, and other military facilities, all planes safely returned to base. On the morning of the 24th, they strongly attacked the enemy airfield in Tacloban, Leyte Island, repeatedly subjecting the airfield to fierce dive-bombing. In addition to destroying its runways, four enemy aircraft on the ground were set on fire, and a subsidiary facility experienced a major explosion. In this attack, one Japanese plane did not return.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Military Strength on Leyte Island Has Increased <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army on Leyte Island is building fortifications on the highlands east of the central mountain range, waiting for reinforcement troops to arrive before launching a counterattack. Since the beginning of November, new elite reinforcement troops of the Japanese army have successively arrived at the front line, and the Japanese army's combat strength has suddenly increased. The enemy forces are finally forced to adopt a defensive posture, and due to excessive losses before and after the landing, the enemy forces' supply is gradually becoming difficult. However, the enemy forces in Carigara are actively reinforcing their forces, attempting to gain a superior position. On the other hand, they are also moving troops from Bapa on the west coast of Leyte northward, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's supply line along the Ormoc coast. However, the Japanese reinforcement troops have already made contact with the defending troops and are flanking and encircling the enemy forces coming from Carigara, driving them back to the vicinity of the coast.</p>
<p>Japanese Suicide Squad Blows Up Enemy Tanks</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base on the Front Line in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy forces on Leyte Island are constantly afraid of the Japanese army's melee attacks and are actively using tanks. The Japanese army has formed suicide squads and special attack teams for battlefield destruction and has established great battle achievements. Brave warriors of the suicide squad, holding explosives weighing thousands of kilograms with special devices, lie in ambush in low-lying areas to counter tank shells. When enemy tanks advance to close range, they ignite the fuse of the explosives, rapidly throw them at the tank's vital parts, and then retreat. In an instant, the enemy tank is completely shattered. The enemy soldiers advancing with the tanks, caught off guard, are all dismayed and flee in panic. The Japanese assault teams then charge forward, killing soldiers and generals. As a result, the enemy forces all raise their hands, lower their heads, and surrender. The Japanese army's special attack teams appear and disappear miraculously, and are active on various parts of the Leyte front line, truly frightening and chilling the enemy forces.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Comprehensive Battle Results of the Japanese Air Force in the Eastern Waters of the Philippines <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle results obtained by the Japanese Air Force from the 21st to the 23rd and the additional battle results of the 19th are recorded as follows: (1) Battle results of the 21st: At around 9:30 AM on the 21st, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy aircraft carrier groups (composed of several ships, including transport ships) in the waters east of Mindanao Island, and a bomb hit the central part of an enemy standard aircraft carrier. The enemy aircraft carrier immediately stopped and tilted greatly. However, after the Japanese planes bombed, they quickly retreated, so it could not be confirmed whether the ship had sunk. However, it is highly likely that the ship has sunk. In this battle, two Japanese planes did not return to base. (2) Battle results of the 22nd: On the 22nd, the Japanese Air Force attacked an enemy transport convoy in the southeastern waters of Siargao Island, sinking one enemy medium-sized transport ship with a torpedo. In this battle, two Japanese planes did not return to base. (3) Battle results of the 23rd: At around 6:30 PM on the 23rd, the Japanese Air Force, braving adverse weather with overlapping dense clouds, strongly attacked an enemy transport convoy escorted by cruisers, destroyers, etc., in the eastern waters of Mindanao. A torpedo hit and sunk one enemy large transport ship, and a torpedo sank one enemy destroyer or cruiser. In this battle, one Japanese plane did not return to base. (4) Additional battle results of the 19th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 21st that the Japanese Air Force bombed an enemy mobile unit in the eastern waters of Luzon Island on the evening of the 19th. The battle results were the sinking of two enemy cruisers and the destruction of one aircraft carrier and one battleship. Later, it was further determined that in this battle, the Japanese Air Force also destroyed three enemy ships of unknown type, causing them to catch fire. It is expected that all three enemy ships have been sunk, and it is believed that these three enemy ships were mostly aircraft carriers. Also, in this battle, the Japanese side's losses totaled eight aircraft that did not return to base. Later, it was further determined that one more aircraft also did not return, bringing the total to nine.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Planes Raiding Tokyo Shot Down and Damaged Fourteen <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:50 AM on the 25th: Regarding the battle results obtained by the Japanese army in the vicinity of Tokyo during the enemy air raid on the 24th, the following has been determined: five shot down (including those announced on the 24th), one of which was shot down by ramming, and nine enemy planes were damaged. In this battle, seven Japanese planes have not yet returned (including the ramming plane).</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy American Air Force, which is actively consolidating its bases for air raids on Japan in the Mariana Islands, finally raided the vicinity of Tokyo after noon on the 24th. On that day, enemy planes, at an altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 meters, divided into several echelons, with as few as six and as many as more than ten, intruded into the suburbs of Tokyo, and some even intruded into the airspace over Tokyo. Because the enemy planes feared the strength of the Japanese anti-aircraft defenses, they were all lightly equipped, carried very few bombs, and the amount of bombs dropped was also small. In addition, the Japanese anti-aircraft defenses were very active, so the Japanese side's damage was very minor, with only a few small fires, which were immediately extinguished without any problems. In this battle, the Japanese side's battle results, according to the announcement as of 5:00 PM, determined that a total of three enemy planes were shot down. Detailed battle results are currently under investigation. The purpose of this enemy plane raid is naturally often seen as destroying the source of Japanese combat power and launching a large-scale attack, but on the other hand, it also contains the purpose of political propaganda. In San Francisco, the enemy American side broadcast at 1:30 PM (Japan time), when enemy planes were raiding Tokyo, that they were launching a large-scale air raid on Tokyo and were heavily bombing factories and other facilities. They also said that this air raid was a pincer operation conducted from bases in the Mariana Islands and bases in China. This statement is completely fictitious. The only base from which the enemy planes launched was the Mariana Islands base. From this, the intention of their strategic air raid is clearly visible.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Mr. Kurusu's Speech <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Mr. Saburo Kurusu, who was the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary when the United States issued an ultimatum to Japan three years ago on November 26, and was in charge of Japanese-American negotiations, delivered a speech at the Kasumigaseki Hall at 7:00 PM on the 25th, titled "Diplomacy Does Not Allow Perfunctoriness," discussing the various efforts made by Japan at that time in the hope of completing the negotiations and the obstruction by pro-war factions in the United States, resulting in the issuance of the ultimatum on the 26th, attempting to place Japan in a deadly position and initiating hostilities. At the same time, he also spoke about the international situation, saying that the British and Americans believed that the speech delivered by Chairman Stalin indicated that the Soviet Union was about to change its past neutral attitude towards Japan, and used this as a pretext for major propaganda. However, this kind of tactic by the British and Americans is nothing more than their usual trick and is of no value. We should always remain calm, face the current state of the international political situation, and further understand the complex relationship of interests between nations. He then pointed out how hypocritical and incomplete the so-called post-war plans of the enemy British and American camps were, and finally said that the world peace that Japan hopes to achieve is the widespread implementation of the various principles of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the world, thereby achieving true world peace based on justice.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution? <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>Q: The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still negotiating intermittently, but is there really a possibility of cooperation between them? If the two parties can truly cooperate, it would be equivalent to opening a new era in the history of the Chinese revolution, and even in the history of all mankind. Precisely because the significance is so great, people are surprised when they hear that the KMT and the Communist Party are negotiating again. This negotiation may, as in the past, end in a break!</p>
<p>A: As you said, the negotiations between the two parties are constantly at risk of breaking down. Currently, the strength of the Chinese Communist Party is 470,000 regular troops and 2.2 million militia forces. The Chinese Communist Party advocates that this number should be reorganized into five armies and sixteen divisions, while the Kuomintang advocates that it should only be reorganized into four armies and ten divisions. It is generally said that this difference in opinion is the main reason for the stagnation of the current KMT-CPC negotiations. However, I believe that the difficulty of the KMT-CPC negotiations does not lie in such military issues, but in the different understandings of the nature of the Chinese revolution by the KMT and the Communist Party. Only if their opinions are completely consistent can genuine cooperation between the two parties be realized.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly is the nature of the Chinese revolution?</p>
<p>A: Every Chinese person knows that the problem of the Chinese revolution is essentially a peasant problem. How to destroy feudal forces and the exploitation and oppression of international imperialism, and liberate the peasants from their suffering. This is the content of the Chinese peasant revolution. Whether the Chinese revolution can succeed depends on whether the peasants participate in the revolution. Sun Wen, a farmer's son who "took taro and millet as his staple food and never ate rice," loudly exclaimed to Kuomintang members at the Guangdong "Peasant Movement Training Class" on August 23, 1924:</p>
<p>"Our revolutionary government wants to create a country with the people as its subject. Because peasants account for the absolute majority in our country, if peasants do not participate in the revolution, our revolution will lose its foundation. The Kuomintang's reorganization this time, to enable peasants to participate in the revolutionary movement, is to build a foundation on the peasants. To make the peasants the revolutionary foundation of our party, this is your responsibility."</p>
<p>Then, he explained the goal of the peasant problem, saying: "We tirelessly talk about the peasant problem because we want to solve the suffering of the peasants and enable the tillers to have their own land. The main goal is to prevent the fruits of the peasants' year-round hard work from being taken away by others. Today, the peasants only get 40% of the fruits of their year-round hard work, while 60% is taken away by the landlords. In addition, the government's taxes are not entirely paid by the landlords, but mostly have to be contributed by the peasants. This current situation in China is truly unfair and outrageous. This dark and unreasonable situation we are in could not be made public in the past, but now the time has come to openly promote it to everyone. What we want to promote now is the first time ever. Since you are propagandists, you must be sincere in your hearts, diligent in your service, and strive to seek happiness for the peasants... Peasants will not achieve happiness if they do not unite to form their own strong organizations. In order for peasants to achieve happiness, I hope you 'go to the people' to carry out propaganda and unite the peasants. If the peasants can all rise up and unite, then our revolution can be achieved immediately."</p>
<p>In this way, it can be clearly understood that the Chinese revolution is a peasant revolution! If the KMT and the Communist Party do not have the same attitude towards this kind of peasant revolution, then the two parties can never cooperate.</p>
<p>Q: But those who guide the Chinese revolution are not peasants, but revolutionary intellectuals in the cities, and those who sponsor the Chinese revolution are the urban bourgeoisie, especially the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia from Sun Wen's point of view.</p>
<p>A: The Chinese revolutionary movement was initially driven by both the Kang Youwei faction and the Sun Wen faction. Everyone knows that Kang Youwei was a progressive element of the old-fashioned literati class, while Sun Wen was a representative of the emerging bourgeoisie, a modern intellectual. At that time, within the country, the autocratic dictatorship of the Qing Dynasty had reached its peak, and the great powers, taking advantage of this undemocratic politics, began to carry out territorial and economic aggression against China. However, the autocratic dictatorship of the Qing Dynasty was unable to resist this aggression by the great powers. Moreover, the more economic concessions it made to the great powers, the more helpless China's finances became, so it had no choice but to increasingly strengthen its exploitation of the people to compensate for the huge deficit in the national treasury. The so-called people are the peasants who make up 90% of China's population. Therefore, the burden on the peasants increased, and the rural economy fell into bankruptcy. Therefore, if anyone rose up among the peasants, there would be an immediate response everywhere. However, the peasant movement, due to its lack of knowledge, only resisted the direct rulers in the local areas, and never expanded into a national people's struggle against imperialist aggression. For this reason, in semi-colonial countries, it is none other than progressive urban intellectuals who lead the peasants to wage a struggle against imperialism. Initially, in this struggle, the old-fashioned intellectuals of the Kang Youwei faction attempted to unite the people's resistance against the imperialist powers by taking advantage of the peasants' belief in the Manchu Qing autocratic regime, in order to fight against the imperialist powers.</p>
<p>Q: Didn't Kang Youwei want to reform the autocratic political system of the Manchu Qing using Western methods?</p>
<p>A: At that time, the urban bourgeoisie's belief in the Manchu Qing autocratic regime was far less than that of the peasants. Especially the bourgeoisie in Guangdong and Shanghai, who had long been in contact with foreign countries, did not want to overthrow the autocratic and dictatorial bureaucratic politics and implement democratic politics themselves. Even Sun Wen went to see Li Hongzhang in 1893 and put forward some "Suggestions to Li Fu Xiang". Anyone who has read this letter knows that Sun Wen was not a born revolutionary. (Of course, Sun Wen's autobiography said: "Since the year of Yiyou—1885—when the Sino-French War failed, I have been determined to 'overthrow the Manchu Qing and establish a Republic'." However, this record is indeed problematic, because believing what a person says in their autobiography is to be fooled. Everyone knows that when a person describes their past, they will inevitably embellish and beautify it to justify themselves.)</p>
<p>Kang Youwei knew the attitude of this bourgeoisie towards the Manchu Qing, and only then did he realize that the Manchu Qing could not maintain its past autocratic regime. Therefore, he wanted to first change the autocratic regime into a form that the bourgeoisie liked, wanting to unite the trust of peasants and the bourgeoisie under the name of enlightened despotism, thereby preventing the aggression of the great powers.</p>
<p>Q: If Kang Youwei, as you said, sincerely supported the Manchu Qing and wanted to make the Manchu Qing reassert its national power in the world, then why did the Manchu Qing exile him? Since there were also figures like Zhang Zhidong within the Manchu Qing government who wanted to use Western civilization to consolidate the Manchu Qing's autocratic regime, shouldn't they have united?</p>
<p>A: As you said, the Westernization Movement of Zhang Zhidong and Li Hongzhang and the movement of Kang Youwei and others once wanted to merge. In fact, at one point, Zhang Zhidong was even a supporter of Kang Youwei within the Manchu Qing government.</p>
<p>To categorically assert that the bureaucrats of the late Manchu Qing Dynasty were always a group that supported imperialist aggression is an oversimplified and naive judgment. If we admit that they were this group, then there is no way to explain Lin Zexu, who led the Opium War. The first to combine with imperialism in China was comprador capital. When the power of comprador capital was still weak at first, the bureaucrats did not want to combine with them. On the contrary, the bureaucrats represented the common demands of the Chinese nation and wanted to drive imperialism out of China. Zhang Zhidong was also one of these people. He wanted to work hard to consolidate the Manchu Qing government, so he believed that it was necessary to adopt Western culture, and thus he took the initiative to initiate the Westernization Movement. However, what he was very worried about at the time was that if Western culture was adopted universally and deeply, then the Confucian ideology (that is, China's national essence ideology) that maintained the Manchu Qing social organization would be completely disintegrated. Therefore, he proposed a mediation method in his famous "Exhortation to Learning": "Chinese learning for internal learning, Western learning for external learning; use Chinese learning to cultivate the body and mind, and use Western learning to deal with worldly affairs." This is the same as the "Japanese spirit, Western skills" ideology of the Meiji Restoration in Japan. There is a simple saying in Chinese, namely "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application." He believed that adopting Western culture was indeed out of necessity, but if this led to the elimination of China's national essence ideology of Confucianism, then China's unity would be broken and the social organization would be destroyed. However, the mainstream of Chinese Confucian ideology even criticized this kind of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" ideology as "not the way of the sages," "heretical doctrines, floods and fierce beasts," and attacked the Westernization Movement as "traitors to morality" and "scum of the literati." Therefore, Kang Youwei used Confucius's theory of the Great Unity to embellish and decorate his own theories, hoping to open up a broad road of thought in China. However, many bureaucrats saw through his deception and called it "Confucius on the surface, Western in essence," which was also a matter of course. Kang Youwei depicted Confucius's world of Great Harmony as a kind of democratic internationalism, even saying that Chinese and foreigners would freely intermarry here, and that the boundaries of countries would gradually disappear in the world, with the whole world united under a common government, women and men being equal, the sick, the old, and the young being protected by the state, and children not being the private property of their parents, but citizens of the state, which were all fundamentally different from the past Confucian ideology. As for his senior disciple, Liang Qichao, known as Kang Youwei's Yan Hui, went even further and even attacked Confucius. Liang Qichao once said the following: "Let me speak of the kinds of slaves of the heart! Then let me discuss the way to get rid of them! First: Do not be a slave to the ancients. Ancient sages and heroes all made great contributions to a group, and we should love and respect them. However, the reason why the ancients are the ancients, and the reason why I am me, and the reason why the ancients were able to become sages and heroes, is it not from my own hands? Otherwise, there would be no later sages if there was a sage, and there would be no more heroes if there was a hero. For example, Confucius recited the laws of Yao and Shun, and we recite the laws of Confucius. We should also think about why Confucius was able to become Confucius, because he stood outside of Yao and Shun. If Confucius were a slave to Yao and Shun, then there would definitely be no more Confucius after a hundred generations."</p>
<p>It is imaginable how Kang Youwei's faction's remarks aroused the indignation of the national essence faction at the time. I do not think that the bureaucrats and the literati class at that time were "the imperialist faction." On the contrary, the bureaucrats felt that Kang Youwei was "the imperialist faction" and opposed him. For example, Gu Hongming, who once served as Zhang Zhidong's private secretary, explained the reasons for their opposition to Kang Youwei as follows:</p>
<p>"The Chinese literati class and the common people are all half a pound of exclusionists and reactionaries. The latter may be even more so. The only class in China that is neither exclusionist nor reactionary is the compradors and upstarts who have made fortunes through foreign trade. Therefore, the general public rose up to oppose Kang Youwei's radical destructionism (Jacobinism). Because Kang Youwei's radical destructionism wanted to completely Westernize China... Therefore, when the general public saw that foreigners and the great powers openly supported Kang Youwei's radical destructionism—which people believed brought ugly and terrifying monsters—they stood up in anger and threw the ugly and terrifying monsters covering the souls of Kang Youwei and all the foreigners residing in China into the vast ocean to be buried in the belly of the fish. This was naturally inevitable. This position is the inherent cause of the Boxer Rebellion's violence."</p>
<p>From this, we can also understand the reasons for the Zhang Zhidong faction's opposition to the Kang Youwei faction. At the same time, we can also know how Kang Youwei would be criticized by those who condemned even Zhang Zhidong's Westernization Movement as "traitors to morality" and "scum of the literati." Although there was a distinction between reactionary and progressive in the criticism of this group of people, most of the Chinese people at that time, just as they experienced in the "Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians" movement during the Meiji Restoration in Japan, had surging emotions of indignation. When these indignant and passionate emotions turned to erupt against the Manchu Qing government, the great cause of the Xinhai Revolution was completed. Those who directed this national sentiment against the Manchu Qing were, in terms of class, the urban bourgeoisie, and in terms of leaders, Mr. Sun Wen.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Western Front Southern Flank: The Battle Situation is Still Unstable; American and French Troops Break into Strasbourg <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th. Huitong News Agency: The situation on the southern flank of the Western Front is still unstable. American and French tank units of the U.S. Seventh Army, after breaking into the Zabern lowland, have made slight progress to the southeast. Their vanguard has entered Strasbourg, where fierce fighting is underway. The area entered by the anti-Axis forces in central Alsace is still small, but General Patch will inevitably attempt to expand it, generally moving rapidly southward in order to make contact with the French First Army entering Saint-Dié, and advance towards the Rhine River in a pincer movement. If this happens, the German forces in the Vosges region are at risk of being surrounded. However, the French First Army is currently preoccupied with its own situation, and it is still questionable whether it can carry out this mission. Although the German defense line is now more fluid, it can still crush the enemy's encirclement plan. Even if the U.S. Seventh Army can quickly advance to Strasbourg, it will not be able to win this battle. Therefore, the subsequent developments will be the same as the situation after the British army broke through Nijmegen.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Raging on the Aachen Front</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th. The focus of the Western Front has changed again and again, and is currently concentrated in the Aachen area, and the British and American forces, seeking to invade the Ruhr industrial area, are also extremely restless. The German Supreme Headquarters has also confirmed that the above report is generally accurate. It is said that in the battles in the Aachen area over the past week, the British and American forces have lost 320 tanks and at least 20,000 troops. Furthermore, the U.S. Ninth Army, which is advancing towards Cologne, has now reached the Rur River valley west of the Rhine River and is advancing 26 kilometers away from Cologne. In addition, the U.S. Third Army under Patton, which is operating on the southern flank of the Western Front, is currently fighting with the German army in the Metz area, with one part reaching a location 85 kilometers from Saarbrücken, and another team breaking through the Alsace-Lorraine line east of Saarbrücken. Taking an overview of the above-mentioned Western Front battle situation, it is impossible not to recognize that the German army is at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Transportation Company of this city (i.e., the tram company) is adjusting the tram timetable slightly because today (26th) is Sunday and there are more passengers than usual. The hours of operation are from 6:30 AM to 10:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. Tomorrow (27th) will still be the usual 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

<p>The police bureau of this city stipulates that economic law enforcement matters should be handled by the economic police, and other police officers must not participate in or spontaneously investigate goods. Bureau Chief Chen, in his capacity as bureau chief, has issued secret and supervisory orders to this effect on June 1st and July 4th of this year. However, it has been found that recently, there are still some unscrupulous police officers who obstruct cargo transportation and use the name of investigating goods to create difficulties for merchants or even extort money. This is a violation of discipline. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. Except for the economic police, no other police officers may intercept cargo transportation en route or create difficulties for vendors on the pretext of investigation. Those who dare to violate this will be severely punished upon discovery. All supervising officers are ordered to strictly order their subordinates to comply and to inspect and prohibit the occurrence of such illegal activities at any time.</p>

<p>The temporary cotton cloth rationing is about to expire. This reporter made a special visit to Mr. Gao Ai-zhou, the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Business Office of the cloth wholesalers, to inquire about the rationing situation. According to him: "This office was ordered to handle the temporary cotton cloth rationing in this city. It was a new undertaking with no precedent to follow. Fortunately, with the guidance and assistance of all relevant parties, we were able to complete it. Now, the cotton cloth that should be allocated to each retailer has been fully distributed. The temporary rationing will temporarily end at the end of this month. However, after checking, the duration of this temporary rationing was set from June 1st to November 30th of this year and will not be extended. There are now less than five days until the deadline. Citizens who have not yet purchased with their certificates should do so promptly as scheduled. Once the deadline has passed, they will become waste paper. We hope that citizens holding certificates will not wait and delay themselves. As for purchase certificate No. 463, please go to Hengfengchang Store, retailer No. 447 at No. 241 West Lin'an Road (formerly Rue Kázár), to purchase. For purchase certificate No. 620, please go to Zhongyu Store, retailer No. 477 at No. 30 Liuhhe Road (formerly Rue Aolihhe), to purchase. Furthermore, if any allocated merchants have failed to move the distributed cloth to their stores for any reason, they should immediately report the reasons to this office and quickly seek a solution to facilitate the sales."</p>

In the second half, Zhongbei's luck suddenly turned, and they tied the score at 17-17. After that, the game gradually became a seesaw battle, with extreme suspense. At the end, the score was tied at 28-28. In the five-minute overtime, Dahua gave up continuing the game, and Zhongbei won 2-0.

<h3 id="e31">Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Shelters to Reduce Casualties <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Fire Prevention Drinks: Water Preparation</p>
<p>(3) For example, a bomb falling in the center of the road seems capable of destroying all underground installations, such as water pipes and gas pipes. If directly hit, they are very likely to lose their effectiveness. Therefore, sufficient fire prevention water should be prepared, and the importance of water wells that can be used as drinking water in emergencies should be re-recognized. At this time, the reliance on gas, water, and electricity should be forgotten. In addition, preparations should be made in advance for communication and reporting when telephone lines are unavailable to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>(4) The idea that incendiary bombs can only cause fires and bombs can only cause destruction should be corrected. Bombs also have considerable heat and burning power when dropped, which can easily cause fires.</p>
<p>(5) Firefighting, rescue, and other facilities are limited, and can only be deployed at key points in emergencies. Therefore, it is necessary to abandon dependence on these facilities. Emergency rescue and initial firefighting training should be carried out in various areas, and efforts should be made to ensure that all kinds of training can be effectively utilized.</p>
<p>The Bystander Attitude Must Change</p>
<p>(6) In past air defense exercises, the training level of the Baojia and other personnel directly responsible for air defense has made considerable progress, which is gratifying. However, some citizens still adopt a bystander attitude. Therefore, if an actual air raid occurs, the majority of citizens are likely to be in danger. Some arbitrarily sit in rickshaws or watch aerial battles, while others repair roofs, thus suffering unexpected disasters. Therefore, in order to thoroughly promote air defense awareness, all citizens should take shelter in the future, and the general public should participate in shelter drills or other actions during normal air defense exercises.</p>
<p>Eliminate the Spread of Pro-Enemy Rumors</p>
<p>(7) Sometimes, friendly aircraft in aerial combat drop reserve fuel tanks for operational convenience, causing some people to mistakenly believe that friendly forces are dropping bombs, thus spreading rumors. This should be recognized and not trusted. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that some unscrupulous elements spread rumors, engage in pro-enemy behavior, or attempt to profit themselves. Citizens should cooperate more to eliminate these rumors. Anyone who unintentionally spreads rumors will be subject to severe penalties under military law.</p>
<p>(8) Furthermore, on the 21st, when enemy aircraft blindly bombed a certain location, some Baojia members from other areas went to visit the affected area. This behavior had a significant impact on the authorities' rescue efforts and should be avoided. Assistance to the authorities in the affected area is welcome, but mere sightseeing is prohibited. Baojia cadres should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Hospitals Should Admit and Treat Patients as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department has noted that many civilians are injured during air raids, and general hospitals (including public and private) and physicians have an obligation to assist in rescue. Therefore, the department has specifically notified all hospitals and physicians' clinics in the city that if anyone is injured in an air raid, whether sent by the authorities or seeking treatment on their own, they must be treated immediately. Seriously injured patients should be allowed to stay in the hospital for treatment within the capacity of each hospital or clinic and should not be refused. It is reported that the Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department, together with personnel from the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, will be dispatched to various hospitals in the city to investigate the ward facilities and the number of beds in each hospital in preparation for necessary needs.

<h3 id="e32">Second Kamikaze Attack Unit <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>When the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet announced to the entire army the great exploits established by the First Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Shikishima Squadron on the Surigao Strait, the entire navy, filled with gratitude to the airmen fighting in the Philippines, resolved to destroy the enemy and their morale was further boosted. Prior to this, when the news of the formation of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit was first announced, all officers and men of the naval air force believed that this was a golden opportunity to fulfill their long-cherished wish, and they all wanted to join the Special Attack Unit, vying to be the first to carry out a suicide attack. Thus, the Second Special Attack Unit held a solemn naming and farewell ceremony on the 27th before departing from the base to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Departure Instructions</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 27th, the enemy fleet, which had been heavily attacked by both the Japanese sea and air forces in the naval battle off the Philippine Islands and was on the verge of collapse, stubbornly approached with its surviving ships in an attempt to cover the army on Leyte Island. The Japanese naval air force, regardless of dawn, day, dusk, or night, continued to depart from the Philippine air fortress one after another without rest... continuous attacks left the enemy with no chance to breathe. At the base, reports and departures were intertwined, and enemy mobile units and ships in Leyte Gulf were successively buried at the bottom of the sea. In the midst of this tense and intense situation, the Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit quietly departed. In the skies above a certain place, friendly aircraft were flying out to attack. The Commander-in-Chief summoned the flight-suited crew members to headquarters and solemnly held a ceremony to deliver the orders. On the verdant ground, the crew members, with Commander K at the center, were neatly lined up. Their captain was Lieutenant 〇〇, 25 years old. They were all from pre-flight training or flight training, and the youngest was only 19 years old. Soon, the Commander-in-Chief walked to the platform, and the faces of the brave men all turned towards the Commander.</p>
<p>"Order of October 27th, Showa 19</p>
<p>Hereby order the air unit commanded by Commander K, Commander of the air unit at a certain base, to form a Special Attack Unit, with Lieutenant 〇〇 as the captain. The unit is named as follows:</p>
<p>Unit name: Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit</p>
<p>Squadron names: 'Loyalty,' 'Valor,' 'Pure Loyalty,' 'Utmost Sincerity,' 'Sincere Loyalty'"</p>
<p>The order was personally handed down by the Commander-in-Chief. The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, whose loyal souls would leave a lasting legacy, was thus born. The crew members stood upright and motionless. Next, the Commander made a farewell speech to them.</p>
<p>"Expecting not to return alive from battle is something the enemy can also do, but to be prepared from the beginning to sacrifice one's life to accomplish one's mission is something they cannot do. To demonstrate this great spiritual power, to reveal this supreme and pure spirit of sacrifice, is to be worthy of being a soldier of the divine land! Now, you have all done it, and you are truly the soldiers among soldiers!"</p>
<p>The Commander's sincere words were powerful and came from the heart. The crew members' expressions were firm and tense, like statues. The Commander continued, his voice even louder.</p>
<p>"You will certainly achieve your goals on your journey! Your loyalty, valor, pure loyalty, and utmost sincerity, your unparalleled achievements, will move the Emperor, and your parents, whether they are alive or not, will be truly gratified, and a hundred million compatriots will be grateful and moved. I deeply look forward to your success!"</p>
<p>The farewell speech ended. Soon, the Commander calmly said in a solemn tone: "Now, let's have a farewell drink!" The Commander and all the staff held a sincere farewell banquet in a corner of the square. Under the lush greenery, a white-clothed table was set with wine. The Commander, the staff, the Commander, the Deputy Commander, the Flight Commander, and the crew members faced each other at the national table.</p>
<p>"A toast, to wish you a safe journey and success!" The Commander raised his glass, and the crew members' glasses were filled with sacred wine. They smiled and drank it all in one gulp. At that moment, the hearts of the Commander and the crew members became one. It was early in the day, and each unit took one last commemorative photo. Those who were seeing them off bid farewell with tears, while those who were embarking smiled and departed. Thus, a new chapter was added to Japan's glorious history.</p>
<p>Hitting the Mark Every Time</p>
<p>The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, which departed that day, was commanded by Captain 〇〇, leading the squadrons of Loyalty, Valor, Pure Loyalty, Utmost Sincerity, and Sincere Loyalty, with Squadron Leader 〇〇 and Captain A commanding the escort fighter squadrons to provide cover.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the aircraft waiting for departure, with bombs guaranteed to hit their targets loaded under their wings, began to start up in the line. Captain 〇〇 led the crew members in a line in front of the command post. Amidst the clatter of the aircraft engines, Captain 〇〇 made a clear departure report, his voice filled with the belief that they would win. The fate of the motherland rested on this battle!</p>
<p>"Now, we are giving up our lives to embark on the glorious mission of attacking enemy aircraft carriers."</p>
<p>After listening to this report, Commander K solemnly encouraged everyone:</p>
<p>"Good luck, do your best!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the Commander's eyes flashed with a look of hope. After that, the Flight Commander specified the key points regarding the attack strategy, and then Captain 〇〇 gave a final pep talk to the crew:</p>
<p>"If you are going to your death and you don't pay attention to the enemy fighters, you are terribly wrong. Although our escort squadrons will deal with the fighters, we should carefully protect ourselves before we reach the enemy mobile unit. If you die before you reach the enemy ships, your deaths will be in vain! So, you must still be on guard against enemy fighters. Watch carefully!"</p>
<p>The crew members nodded in unison. They would not die until they reached their targets. When they found their targets, they would desperately crash into the enemy ships. The only reason they wanted to preserve their lives was to die in the right place!</p>
<p>Thus, a few moments later, "Ah, let's go!" The crew members ran to their aircraft. On the way, they patted the fighter pilots who were responsible for providing cover, smiling and begging:</p>
<p>"Hey, please watch my final moment!"</p>
<p>After that, they casually threw the cigarettes they were smoking on the ground and stomped on them with their flight boots, quickly walking towards the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Second Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, from the Commander to the crew members, just like in their normal training, calmly and unhurriedly, one aircraft, two aircraft, three aircraft, departed in succession from the base from which they would never return. Commander-in-Chief, Commander K, the Flight Commander, and the maintenance crew waved their white cloths. The aircraft formed a magnificent formation in the sky above, circled the base once, and then flew east. Until the aircraft disappeared into the distant horizon, no one moved a step. Commander K remained at the base, praying for the success of the mission.</p>
<p>"Let the Divine Wind rise with human bombs, resolutely advancing, and even ghosts and gods will make way!" Just like this belief, the results of their loyalty were brought to the headquarters. The Kamikaze Special Attack Unit went to the Gulf of Leyte and the eastern sea of the Philippines, successfully hitting many enemy ships and establishing great merit.

<p>— Yi Xuan</p>
<p>I don't often take buses; unless the road is very long, I prefer to walk. But after a major illness at the office, my physical strength greatly declined. Every morning, I had to take the tram to school; sometimes I carried painting supplies. In the crowded car, it was truly a great burden, even more tiring than walking. At this time, a kind old man would often give up his seat. Later, it almost became a routine. If I didn't have a seat, I was extremely grateful, but other than a soft "Thank you," I could only gaze at his silvery white hair, offering sincere thanks in my heart.</p>
<p>We got off at the same stop. I often followed behind him, watching him stoop, his hands inserted into the pockets of his worn-out overcoat, slowly walking step by step into the cemetery near my school.</p>
<p>What a desolate place a cemetery is. Under the pure white tombstones, whether lying there is extraordinary talent or unparalleled beauty, now they all decay in their bodies like ordinary people. Here, you can't hear joyful laughter or see pleasant expressions. Although there are lush trees and vibrant flowers, there's not a trace of vitality. Even the songs of birds are filled with lonely and tragic tunes. Here, there are only brimming tearful eyes and soft sobs. Why does the old man go there every day without fail? Could his relatives be buried inside? So, in addition to respect, I also felt sympathy.</p>
<p>It was a drizzly, late-autumn morning. The gloomy sky was like a huge lead block, gray and lifeless. I felt an unusual tightness in my chest and was mentally distracted, with some slight melancholy and some light complaints. The car was more crowded than usual. When we reached our destination, the car hadn't stopped yet, but the door was already open. I stood at the door, waiting for it to stop. Unexpectedly, a casual glance nearly made me fall forward. At this moment, an arm stopped me. When I slightly regained my senses, preparing to thank him, suddenly, as the hand withdrew, I exclaimed in surprise. That hand, except for a part of the thumb, was just a flat piece of flesh. I leaned woodenly against the wall of the car, forgetting to move. I realized that this was the old man's right hand. In that instant of exclamation, I met his kind gaze and also heard a slight sigh. In that glance and sigh, there was sadness, there was blame. Although I didn't know the reason for his missing finger, how painful is it to be disabled? For an elderly disabled person, how could I have treated him so rashly, almost disrespectfully?</p>
<p>I really wanted to rush up and apologize to him, beg for forgiveness, but I didn't do it. My mood was uneasy all day. At any moment, I could imagine an old man, wandering among the tombstones, lamenting all that he had lost. This kind of melancholy weather, coupled with an uneven and bumpy fate, is unbearable to look back on! Pitiful old man!</p>
<p>For several days in a row, I deliberately left early. I was ashamed of my rudeness. I dared not meet those deer-like, kind eyes again. But even so, it couldn't restore peace to my soul. On the contrary, this impression became more and more painful in my heart.</p>
<p>"Child, sit here!" I met him again. When I just got on the car and saw him, I unconsciously held my breath, lowered my head, and turned my back to him, but his left hand still touched my shoulder. When I looked up to thank him, from his kind, condescending gaze, I knew that he had forgiven me.</p>
<p>School life is like a quiet stream of water. Occasionally, throwing in a small stone will cause ripples to spread in circles. Therefore, the news that all the middle schools in the city would jointly hold an art exhibition next year on New Year's Day drove us crazy. Everyone was concentrating on conceiving how to create a great work to win that gold medal.</p>
<p>The green grass had all withered and yellowed. Except for some evergreen trees, all the branches were bare. The natural world presented only the scenery of winter. The students all began to work nervously, but my bookshelf was still a blank sheet of paper. I didn't want to paint an ordinary painting and waste time and effort. My mentality was ridiculously absurd, in that I had to win the championship honor, even though my grades were only good enough to be the best in our school. After two weeks of consideration, I decided to do a sketch of the cemetery. I wanted to pour all my strength into completing it.</p>
<p>The next day, I stepped into that desolate garden with extreme hope. Among the countless upright crosses, I solemnly looked around, preparing to find a suitable place to paint.</p>
<p>Ahead, there was a woman kneeling beside a tomb, crying. Not far from her, there was a man silently offering flowers. I quickly set up my painting supplies and worked attentively. By evening, I had drawn the entire outline, but looking at it carefully, I always felt that the result was not as perfect as I had hoped. It was getting dark, so I had to pack up and come back to paint again tomorrow.</p>
<p>The next day, I spent the whole day trying to modify that draft, but I couldn't get it right. Annoyed, I seemed to feel someone behind me. Looking back, it turned out to be the old man.</p>
<p>"Failed?" he asked me very gently. "Yes," I frowned tightly.</p>
<p>"You forgot something!"</p>
<p>"What did I forget?" I rummaged through my paint box. I didn't forget anything.</p>
<p>"You forgot to put your emotions into it! Therefore, your painting has only become colorful paper without a soul!" "Emotions?"</p>
<p>"Yes, emotions are the soul of art. When you hear a wonderful piece of music, you can rejoice or grieve with its notes. Similarly, a successful picture can also express the author's emotions and thoughts, and control people. Why did you come here to sketch? Are you trying to show people that this is a tragic place, that it has swallowed many people's loved ones, separated them into two worlds, leaving behind poignant longing and heart-wrenching grief? But you didn't paint those emotions into it. You only painted some dull images!"</p>
<p>I suddenly understood, and at the same time, I couldn't help but admire his wisdom. I had always thought that he was just a pitiful cemetery caretaker, but now I felt like I was as small as a grain of dust.</p>
<p>The setting sun was sinking in the west, crows were flocking back to their nests, and the west wind was blowing through the bare branches, seeming to play a lonely song for the world. I looked at the densely arranged crosses in front of me. The old man slowly walked between the tombstones, often bending down to pick up the withered bouquets that the mourners had offered.</p>
<p>My inspiration suddenly surged. I resolutely rearranged the paper, breathed on my frozen fingers, and started working again.</p>
<p>From then on, every time I painted, the old man would always guide me. Doubts also began to sprout in my heart. Several times I asked him, "You must have studied painting, right?" "No, no," he shook his head, walking further away.</p>
<p>My painting was finally completed. The teachers all praised it highly, the students cast envious glances, and I myself was full of pride.</p>
<p>The day before the exhibition opened, I learned his address from another young man who also frequented the cemetery. He lived in a dim attic. When I pushed the door open and went in, he opened his eyes wide in surprise and looked at me. His cheeks had a fiery blush. I touched his burning hot forehead. Anxiety made me forget all words of comfort.</p>
<p>"Sit for a while! I really wanted to visit your exhibition, but my illness just won't get better." That voice was as low as a mosquito's buzz.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is the final. I really hope you come!"</p>
<p>"I also long to come. You know art is my life, but I..." He stopped talking. At this moment, I immediately noticed the many picture frames hanging on the wall. I couldn't help but walk over to admire them. The vigorous brushstrokes, the unique layout, all showed that they were not from an ordinary hand.</p>
<p>"Whose works are these?" I turned back to ask the old man, but he closed his eyes and didn't say a word. Suddenly, I realized that these might be the old man's works. Just then, I discovered the two words "Lin Yu" in the lower corner of a painting.</p>
<p>This familiar name attracted me. Finally, I blurted out in a low voice, "Oh! Lin Yu!" "How do you know him?" It was the old man's weak voice.</p>
<p>"He was my uncle's classmate. I often heard my uncle talk about him. He was a talented painter."</p>
<p>"A talented painter..." the old man muttered to himself, a look of resentment seeming to be revealed on his face, his eyes shooting out bright rays, "Talent without money and power to cultivate it only leads to decline."</p>
<p>"You also know him?" I deliberately probed.</p>
<p>"Yes," he closed his eyes again, "He's finished! Poverty forced him. For his wife's childbirth expenses, he had to work in a factory. As a result, a machine crushed his finger, and his wife had a miscarriage and died. He drifted alone in the world, spending all day guarding his wife's grave..."</p>
<p>"Lin Yu is you!..." I exclaimed in surprise. The corners of his mouth twitched, and tears constantly welled up in his sunken eye sockets.</p>
<p>"But why don't you hold exhibitions?" After a long time, I came up with this sentence.</p>
<p>"Alas! You are still young. You don't understand that this is a world of power. I don't have a lot of money to promote myself, and I don't have famous celebrities to tout for me. And I don't want to beg for pity from others because of material deficiencies, insulting the sacred art... It's over! I'm finished!"</p>
<p>I felt dazed, as if in a dream, but I knew that this was a real dream.</p>
<p>The room gradually darkened, and people and things all wore blurry shadows.</p>
<p>"You can go back!" His voice was even weaker. "Go back! Don't mention me to anyone. In my life, I least want to receive other people's pity."</p>
<p>I still stood there, not moving. "Maybe I'll get better tomorrow."</p>
<p>Until the final the next afternoon, my mood was still in a state of turmoil. I didn't believe that society was so cruel to an artist. At the same time, I was still thinking about how to help this impoverished old man. My body was in the exhibition hall, but my mind was far away. I seemed to hear someone shouting my name, but I was still lost. Only when the surrounding students were urging me did I wake up from my dream and stand up.</p>
<p>I finally achieved my goal. The gold medal was pinned on my chest! "This is not my honor. This is given to me by Lin Yu."</p>
<p>After the meeting, I rushed to the old man's place at the fastest speed. The room was still as quiet as yesterday. I tiptoed to his bedside. He was lying there peacefully. I couldn't suppress the joy in my heart. I wanted to share this joy with him.</p>
<p>I gently took his hand, just about to wake him up, but his hand was already as stiff as stone. I only felt a bone-chilling coldness seeping into my heart! Freezing my blood...</p>

<h3 id="e35">Eulogy and Preface for Elder Toyama Mitsuru <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Lanting</p>
<p>Indeed, to recall bright virtue may evoke shared sorrow across different eras; to admire outstanding talents may stir mutual lamentation despite separate countries. How much more so when residing in countries of the same continent, where deep affection exists for heroes who have lived through life, and witnessing the nurturing of courage to perform heroic deeds by a commoner; welcoming neighboring good friends, engaging in heart-to-heart discussions. Remembering the previous contributions of aid, which truly benefited our country! Toyama Mitsuru of Japan is a revered elder of the Eastern nation. As a leader of an opposition party, he served as a respected figure through four dynasties. Tracing back to his founding of the Genyosha, to gather young people, and publishing the Fukuryo Shinbun to propagate his principles, his devotion to national affairs, not to be swayed by major parties, has long been known throughout Kyushu and praised by neighboring countries. Uniquely, for fifty years he has assisted our country's revolution, supporting the success of our predecessors, with integrity and sincerity, worthy of gratitude. Initially, when our Father of the Nation (Sun Yat-sen) was besieged in London, he traveled east to Japan, immediately interacting with Elder Toyama. Subsequently, when the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established in Tokyo, as a base for rebuilding revolutionary strategies, many in Japan's government and public supported it, and Elder Toyama especially assisted and guided from the side. And when the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the Father of the Nation returned from overseas, Elder Toyama promptly rushed to Shanghai to welcome him. Since then, our country's patriots who went to Japan to visit Elder Toyama almost all listened to his teachings and received his guidance. Therefore, according to what my Chinese ancients said, "accepting exiles, generously loading carriages," his spirit of chivalry is like that of Lord Lu who lost his family, and "offering silk to reciprocate," his friendship with Wu neighbors is like that of Gongsun Qiao, diminishing the merits of Qin, and treating gold as trifling. Considering his noble spirit, it is even like that of Lu Zhonglian. Now, I hear that Elder Toyama passed away on October 6th of this year, enjoying a lifespan of ninety years. Considering the vastness of the ocean, and the war being at its height, hoping for harmony between the two countries, the venerable elder has suddenly departed. In the past, Yanling had a memorial erected for a traveler who died, and the judge of Lu, passing by, inscribed it on a tablet. When Xu Jun died, the Duke of Wu hung his sword for him. These were all individuals who were not of the same country, yet their admiration for the illustrious demeanor led to repeated expressions of sentiment. May we follow their example, and thus write a eulogy:</p>
<p>"Oh, Elder Toyama, a revered elder of the Eastern nation, a progressive of the intelligentsia, and a close friend of the Father of the Nation. His character is fit to be cast in gold, his reputation is admired like the Big Dipper. Why not a hundred years, to suddenly hear of his passing away? Before the Restoration, he was born in Fukuoka, not seeking officialdom, but his name spread widely as he gathered like-minded individuals, having both courage and knowledge, ready to serve the country, with a strong determination to uphold the Emperor. He greatly advocated the East Asian Alliance, consistently adhering to his principles, thinking to unite the two countries. As for our Father of the Nation, seeking to save the country, their views coincided, and they were perfectly aligned. Throughout his revolutionary life, he frequently traveled to the East, relying on Elder Toyama's management, the Father of the Nation passed away, his spirit entering the netherworld, Elder Toyama came to hold the ropes, his old tears flowing freely. Human schemes, and ghostly machinations, national relations were complex and conflicting, brotherly customs, holding up against foreign insults, fortunately with enlightened intelligence, setting right errors, the friendship was aligned with the Alliance, East Asia could be independent, and it’s great flag flies high, the sea waves fly and roar, victory is in sight, the morning light is subtle, the principles have been thoroughly implemented, the Rising Sun shines again. Elder Toyama could not preside, at ninety a sudden loss.

<h3 id="e36">A Record of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Mo</p>
<p>At the mention of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, anyone in the world with even a slight knowledge of East Asian affairs must have heard of that illustrious figure.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru was not only a promoter of the Japanese Empire but also a friend of the East Asian revolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru lived for ninety years, spanning the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras since his birth in Ansei 2 (i.e., 1855). His life can be described as the modern history of Japan's rise. The reason why Japan has become so strong, leading East Asia, and displaying its power to the world is due in no small part to Mr. Toyama Mitsuru's advocacy and promotion within the broader social strata.</p>
<p>He harbored great ambitions from a young age. He opposed clan politics and was dissatisfied with the autocratic tendencies of the political system after the Meiji Restoration, thus advocating the civil rights movement. However, while promoting civil rights, he still advocated respecting the imperial family and preserving the traditional character of the Japanese state. The famous Genyosha, which he led at the time, promoted these three main principles:</p>
<p>(1) Respect for the Imperial Family</p>
<p>(2) Promotion of National Power Overseas</p>
<p>(3) Respect for Civil Rights</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru was truly the pioneer of the Japanese nationalist movement. He combined influential figures in the general society to engage in activities to promote the prestige of the Japanese Empire, and to promote Pan-Asianism. Its headquarters was the Genyosha, initially gathered by fellow countrymen in Fukuoka. The Genyosha occupies a very important position in the history of Japanese national movements. During the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, many members of the Genyosha dedicated themselves to the country and established great achievements. The Genyosha has produced successive generations of talented individuals. The former Prime Minister Hirota Koki, who is now an important minister of Japan, was Mr. Toyama Mitsuru's proud disciple. The current Director of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau and Minister of State, Ogata Taketora, and others are also figures who came from the Genyosha.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru had a broad mind, and his disciples were all over the country and even in East Asia. He greatly admired the words of Lu Xinwu of the Ming Dynasty, "Enlarge your heart to answer the things of the world, empty your heart to contain the good of the world," and established them as a motto. He also believed that a person's heart should and can be stripped bare like a person's body, advocating to serve people with virtue and sincerity. One can imagine his magnanimity. This is also precisely why he was able to absorb a large number of patriots under his command.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru also loved Sinology and worshiped Confucius and Mencius, so he was also a scholar. He was very sympathetic to China. When the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, was engaged in revolution, he received a lot of help from him. Leader Wang Jingwei often sought guidance from him during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru not only gave great support to China, but also to the revolutionary movements of other countries in East Asia. When the Indian patriot Bihari Bose fled to Japan, he was also protected by Mr. Toyama and was able to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>Such a giant has now abandoned us and passed away. According to Japanese people, hearing of Mr. Toyama's death is like losing a loving father. People throughout East Asia must feel the same way.</p>
<p>When Mr. Toyama was alive, he devoted his entire life to national affairs as an ordinary citizen. He died without any official rank or position, which is truly rare in the world.</p>
<p>On September 27th of this year, Mr. Toyama wrote and presented the words "Loyalty, Courage, Righteousness, and Valour" and "Eternal Imperial Fortune" to his acquaintances. These have become Mr. Toyama's last words.</p>
<p>It is said that disciples Hirota Koki, Ogata Taketora, Miyagawa Gorosaburo, and others will compile a biography of Mr. Toyama. The biography will be very different from the ones previously published. The content will mostly be things that Mr. Toyama verbally recounted, which are very precious. The title is tentatively set as "The Complete Biography of Toyama Mitsuru." Once this book is published, Mr. Toyama's life will surely be made known to the world in detail.</p>

<p>— Ding Mo</p>
<p>When Mr. Toyama Mitsuru is mentioned, anyone in the world who knows a little about East Asian affairs must have heard of that famous person.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru is not only the promoter of the Emperor of Japan, but also the friend of the East Asian Revolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama Mitsuru lived for ninety years, since his birth in Anzheng two years (ie 1855), across the Meiji, Taisho, Showa three generations, his life can be said to be the modern history of Japan's construction. The reason why Japan can have such a strong, leading East Asia, Yangwei the world, Mr. Toyama Mitsuru in the vast social strata to promote the power, its merit is not to be eliminated.</p>
<p>He had great ambitions in his childhood. He opposed the feudal political system, and he was not satisfied with the political form of autocratic tendencies after the Meiji Restoration, but introduced the civil governance movement. However, while introducing civil rights, he still advocated respecting the imperial family and maintaining the traditional character of the Japanese state. The famous Genyosha, which he led at that time, advocated such three major programs.</p>
<p>(1) Respect for the Imperial Family</p>
<p>(2) Promote national prestige overseas</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament: Class A Hua Lian Advances Another Round; Will Face Formidable Opponent Da Hua This Week <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup basketball tournament has become increasingly clear in its standings since Hua Lian Pharmaceutical's victory over the Shan team this week, and Da Hua's forfeit to Zhong Bei. Hua Lian still has two matches left, against Da Hua and Zhong Bei, both of which are difficult challenges. Success will depend on the strategy of Zhang Xiangxiang and Yan Youling, as well as the efforts of all players. The results of this week's Class A matches and noteworthy games are recorded below, with brief comments. There were no significant Class B matches this week, but next week's matches, including Ren Yu vs. [blank] in Class B Division One, and Da Hua Fat Team vs. Zhong Bei vs. Ling You in Class B Division Two, will all be battles for the championship, sure to be intense.</p>
<p>This Week's Class A Results</p>
<p>20th (Monday)</p>
<p>Hua Liang Wins Against V Team 35-28</p>
<p>Da Hua Wins Against Ming Xing 30-26</p>
<p>22nd (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Hua Lian Wins Against Shan Yu 32-25</p>
<p>Ren Yu vs. Tong Ren: Alarm Ends Game Prematurely</p>
<p>24th (Friday)</p>
<p>Hua Ying Wins Against Ming Xing 27-24</p>
<p>Zhong Bei Wins Against Da Hua by Forfeit</p>
<p>Recent Class A Standings</p>
<p>The following four matches are worthy of comment from the past week.</p>
<p>Hua Lian Defeats Agile Shan Team</p>
<p>The match between Hua Lian and the Shan team was particularly anticipated by fans, and the temporary price increase by this newspaper was to benefit the scholarship fund. Before the match, many predicted Hua Lian would win, and the result was as expected. Hua Lian's victory was mainly due to their experience and composure, as well as their successful tactics. The team adopted a man-to-man defense. Their positioning consistently kept them within arm's reach of their assigned player, the most suitable position for man-to-man defense. Being too close makes it easy to foul or be tricked, while staying within arm's reach allows one to block the opponent's throws and makes it difficult for them to break through. This limited the opportunities for Shan team's Lin Weicong and Chen Qingjiang, leading to their defeat. Individually, Hua Lian's Wu Chengzhang was the most successful player on the court. He almost single-handedly took care of the missed shots under the basket, making him a major contributor to Hua Lian's victory. As for the Shan team's performance, their quick shots were pleasing to the eye, beautiful, and clear. Lin Weicong's first basket and Chen Qingjiang's two breakthroughs were moments of brilliance. Their defeat was due to not yet reaching a state of perfected skill. At times they seemed overly eager, while at other times they were too hesitant. However, as an emerging team, their progress is commendable. With some guidance, their future is limitless.</p>
<p>Ren Yu and Tong Ren to Complete Game Tomorrow</p>
<p>Ren Yu versus Tong Ren was also an evenly matched contest. With much at stake regarding their rankings, both sides gave their all. In the past, the Xuan family team, led by Shen Shou Xuan Jun, was known for its offensive prowess, but Xuan Jun's illness has affected their strength. Fortunately, Lu Dazhen has come to Shanghai to join the team, so the impact has been minimal. However, the team's unremarkable performance this season is due to the players' work commitments, which limit their training time together. Under the management of Chen Weiyuan and the guidance of Yu Huanzi, the Ren Yu team has made progress. The match between the two teams was exciting, with a tense atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Ren Yu was leading 32 to 25 with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining when the air raid siren sounded and the game could not continue. After discussion, the authorities decided to complete the game tomorrow (27th) at 6:15 PM. Players from both teams should take note and arrive on time.</p>
<p>Hua Ying Triumphs, Ming Xing Retreats in Defeat</p>
<p>Hua Ying's performance in the Shen Bao Cup has not been as good as Ming Xing's, so many predicted that Ming Xing would defeat Hua Ying. Unexpectedly, Hua Ying's main player, Bao Songjia, rushed over from Suzhou to help the team, boosting morale. Conversely, Ming Xing's Wang Jinghu was unable to come to Shanghai, and He Xiaoguang also did not appear. Furthermore, Tao Shaosheng happened to be unavailable. With the addition of [blank] Qiao Lai [blank] to participate in the game, the team suffered a great loss. Each member of the Hua Ying team performed normally. Wang Xuewu's shots were smooth, Bao Songyuan was active, and his ability to guard the opponent's center was a major reason for their victory. With Ming Xing missing players and Fan Xirong committing four fouls, their defeat was inevitable. In this match, the importance of coaching was evident. During halftime, Qian Xucang's instructions to the players were thorough. As a result, the players were able to follow his advice, leading to victory.</p>
<p>Zhong Bei and Da Hua Deliver a Remarkable Performance</p>
<p>Both sides delivered a remarkable performance, full of suspense. Da Hua adjusted its lineup and used man-to-man defense, choosing players with high stamina as a countermeasure. However, in my opinion, Da Hua's man-to-man defense was too tight. With sufficient stamina, it would be very effective, but because the team had one or two players whose stamina was insufficient, they failed to achieve the ideal result. Zhong Bei's [blank] style has its merits, particularly their individual skills. However, the players' recent form has declined. Shen Yugong, the team's soul, has recently had bad luck with his shots, often missing the basket, probably due to lack of practice. In the first half of the match, Da Hua played freely, winning 17 to 10. In the second half, Zhong Bei suddenly recovered, putting on a final push and eventually taking the lead by five points. The audience thought they had secured the victory. Unexpectedly, Da Hua were courageous and [blank], tying the game at 28 points. The game went into overtime for five minutes. Soon after the start, Zhong Bei's Chen Xuechong and Da Hua's Lu [blank] had a minor clash, and the referee ejected all three players. Da Hua lacked substitutes and could not continue the game, so Da Hua was declared to have forfeited the match, and Zhong Bei won 2 to 0.</p>
<p>Hua Lian Will Face Da Hua Next Week</p>
<p>Next Wednesday (29th), Hua Lian will face Da Hua, one of their final two challenges. Judging by Da Hua's game against Zhong Bei, they should not be underestimated. Moreover, the Yang family players have been in high spirits recently, especially Yang Shulao, who is very excited. Facing this perennial champion, they will undoubtedly come up with innovative strategies to achieve a good result. With Xu Gu as their center, they can challenge Wu Chengzhang's dominance. Shen Jisi is in top form, and his ability to block shots is unmatched in Shanghai. Zhang Banglun has also improved, and his performance in [blank] is more successful than in football. In conclusion, Hua Lian has a greater chance of winning, but it will still take a lot of effort. Let's see how Hua Lian will employ its tactics. It will be the most anticipated scene next week.</p>

<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>(5) One-Handed Underhand Pass</p>
<p>The one-handed underhand pass is more widely used and valuable than the two-handed underhand pass, especially for short passes. In addition to using one hand to grip the ball slightly underneath when passing, the other methods are similar to the two-handed underhand pass. This type of pass is used under the basket. When the opponent approaches and spreads their arms for defense, the ball can be quickly passed under their arm to a teammate running towards the basket for a shot, which is particularly effective.</p>
<p>(Scholarship) Bounce Pass</p>
<p>The value and application of the bounce pass are increasingly significant. Regardless of the offensive strategy, this type of pass is [blank]. [Blank] is especially useful when [blank] is close to the defense, or [blank] when executed in the corner. [Blank] is particularly effective for deceiving the opponent, pretending to pass high or shoot, leaving the opponent unable to anticipate.</p>
<p>This type of pass can be executed with either two hands or one hand, depending on the position of the opponent, but it is mostly done with two hands. When passing to a teammate running forward to receive the ball, the ball should be spun backward to shorten the angle of the bounce for easier reception. The method of spinning the ball is to press and rotate the ball backward and downward with both thumbs. To make the angle of the bounce longer, do the opposite and rotate the ball forward. Regardless of the [blank] distance, the ball must bounce off the ground, with the rebound reaching the receiver's abdomen. The ball should hit the ground near the defender's feet and under their extended arms. This should not be used if the opponent is defending from more than two [blank] away, as it can easily be intercepted.</p>

Wang Ganggan has been hired as an administrator. Mr. Wang is very enthusiastic about sports, which ensures the Green Team's track and field team will develop even more securely.</p>
<p>Zhu Shifang, in the guise of a veteran, demonstrated his old power in the iron ball throw at the Central Youth Autumn Games, winning first place. It is said that Zhu is busy with school affairs and knitting sweaters, so his performance was not ideal.</p>
