<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十八日下午四時三十分發表：日航空部隊於二十四·二十五兩日晚間，連續攻擊摩羅泰島及雷伊泰島之敵機場及雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，收獲戰果如次：（一）摩艦泰島起火十一處以上（內有二處大火）。（二）雷伊泰島塔克羅班及特拉克兩機堪之滑行路與設施·多處炸毀或起火。（三）雷伊泰灣敵運輸船三艘起火，炸毀艦型不詳者兩艘，是役日機六架未歸還。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午七時發表：（一）日軍特別攻擊隊靖國防盜行隊，於十一月二十四日及二十六日，對雷伊泰灣內之敵大型艦船作必中之攻擊，炸毀其四艘，參加此次攻擊者如次：十一月二十四日參加者爲陸軍軍曹村岡稱人，十一月二十六日參加者爲隊長陸軍中尉出丸一男，陸軍少尉谷川昌弘及陸軍軍曹木下顯吾。（二）日軍航空部隊於十一月二十六日夜長驅轟炸塞班島阿斯利特機場，對集結於滑行路南側之敵方B29型機施以轟炸，敞機中彈起火，十載架被炸毀，並有兩處起火，日機全數安返基地。</p>
<p>八纮隊　白畫猛攻</p>
<p>菲律賓基地二十八日中央社電　日陸軍特別攻擊隊，二十七日白盡再度猛攻雷伊泰灣內敵艦船羣，敵艦船被炸沉擊沉或中彈起火者達數十艘之多，當日陸軍特別攻擊隊八紘隊於飛機護衛之下，二十七日上午向雷伊泰灣出動，其中日機七架，對敵艦船敢行直進突擊，擊沉大型艦（似爲戰艦）一艘，大型運輸船四艘，重創起火者大型艦（戰艦或爲大型巡洋艦）一艘，大型運輸船一艘以上，各戰果均由日軍衛護機確認。此外，敵機三架畏懼日軍攻擊，均以高速迴旋逃避，日軍遂得對敵大型巡洋艦三艘開始必中攻擊。日軍護衛機熊坂。決崎兩上士機，當友機擊中敵艦時，即避入雲內，待再度自雲中脫出時，敵三艘大型巡洋艦已沉入海底矣。</p>
<p>海軍機樹立殊勳</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日海軍新銳轟炸機「慧星」號及新銳攻擊機「銀河」號之威名，業經風傳各地，按慧星號爲單發機，銀河號爲雙發機，日空軍出動轟炸時，兩機多參加，其性能之優秀，以及其飛行迅速，使敵極爲震驚。上月中旬台灣海面空戰時，「慧星」·「銀河」兩機均行參加，即神風特別攻擊隊攻擊菲律賓週圍敵艦船，亦與零式戰鬬機共同參加作戰，而目下神風特別攻擊隊於菲律賓週圍空戰中，每因「慧星」·「銀河」兩機參加，樹立不朽之殊勳。</p>
<p>雷伊泰　展開決戰</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　雷伊泰島戰事，刻正以該島屋　山脈之東麓地區與卡里加拉灣西部地區爲主要戰場，戰門之熾烈，日日加甚，雙方出動主力，展開決戰之氣氛，刻刻昂揚，而戰械上空制空權之爭奮戰及戰域周遭之運輸接濟戰，亦益見活潑。日陸海軍特別攻擊隊遭來曾相繼出動，以大無畏之肉彈拼撞敵艦船，而奪敵之膽，喪敵之魄。</p>
<p>薩馬島　敵遭夜襲</p>
<p>菲島前綫日軍基地廿八日中央社電　據雷伊泰島日夜戰鬬，日前特由塔克羅班對岸附近，以一部兵力於薩馬島登陸，沿海島岸次西進，十一日已進至比那班克達附近。待機中之日軍，十二日以來出以猛烈反攻，十四日勇猛夜襲，敵突遭日軍猛攻，退至比那班克運南方十公里之卡比卡附近，刻於該地構築防衛陣地中，其後並無積極之前進。又敵方雖行宣傳於薩馬島有大兵力登陸，但其實際勢力僅有騎兵第一師之一大了，且其裝備僅有迫擊砲而已。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　緬甸戰綫因雨季已過，故又漸形活躍，尤以自本月中旬以來，渝軍攻勢更形激烈，而日軍亦隨處予以反攻，同時，密芝那方面渝軍已向北方退却，茲將各該方面戰况誌次。（一）緬甸北部渝新編第三十師及第三十八師，自十六日以來，曾進抵入莫近郊五公里附近，並自三方面開始進攻，該方面日守軍即英勇邀擊，刻已將其擊退。又渝新編第二十二師自休耶古方面渡過伊洛瓦底河後，更欲南進，但因被日軍隨處擊潰，故未得逞，目前八莫方面仍在日軍掌握中。又密芝那方面，日軍續仃猛攻，敵英印軍於受重創後，已向北退却。（二）卡來瓦方面日軍，刻正逐次整頓戰綫中，同時依然鞏守加來米及卡來瓦北方三十公里附近地域，目前正與敵人對峙中。（三）加拉頓方面敵西亞軍第八十一師，於巴列特瓦地區逐次集結兵力，但該方面戰綫一帶仍無大變化，布其頓方面亦然。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫基地二十八中央社電　緬甸方面日軍航空隊，二十五日夜急襲北緬密芝那敵機塲，冒猛烈防空砲火，反覆加以攻擊，當有七所中彈起火，陸上敵機及附屬設施，均受重創，是役敵戰鬥機維曾邀擊，均被擊退，日全機安返基地。</p>

<h3 id="c5">充實農業實騐工作 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>今年是增產年，現在一年之中十一個月已經過去了，究竟增產的成績怎樣？我們試加檢討，恐怕統計數字並未增加。農業方面，若干地方的收成不佳。工業方面，原料動力均有限制。所以，增產年仍是形式上的名詞而已。</p>
<p>就農業增產而言，如果獲得增產的實效，必先具備三個條件，第一是天時，第二是環境，第三是技術。前者是自然的，後二者是人爲的。不過人爲的努力，也可以補救自然的缺陷，譬如旱時可以噴霧澆水。而人爲的如不努力，則天時縱好，也屬徒然的。所以，人爲的環境與技術，是農業增產中兩個主要因素。</p>
<p>所謂環境是屬於政治的，譬如治安的確立，使農民安心於耕作；苛捐雜稅的取締，使農民減少痛苦；所謂技術是屬於科學的，譬如耕作方法的改進，耕作工具的改良，病害虫的預防，種籽的選擇。所以，增產是一個實際的工作，不是一個理論的問題。同時，又是一個經常不斷的工作，決非一蹴即就的。</p>
<p>因此，我們認爲如言農業增產，必須對於環境及技術兩點，首先逐漸做到。在技術研究方面，中央農業實騐所應負相常責任。最近本報派遺記者考察各地，曾參觀該所，對於州該所目前工作情况略作報吿（見今日旅行通信），我們讀了參觀記以後，深感該所工作限於經費，不能發揮應有使命，因此對於農業技術的改進工作，極少貢獻，對於炎業增產的條件未能具備。希望有關當局從實際上予以改善。於此。我們貢獻意見如次：</p>
<p>（一）實騐機構並非行政機構，絕對需要實際工作，尤須有成績表現，推廣利用。決不能視作聊備一格的衙門，安揷幾個人員而已。對於必要的事業費應盡量增加，但須絕對用於事業方面，俾一切技術工作，按照預定計劃依次推進。其他事務費方面另行設法，亦須增加。同時，實騐所也須適應環境，整理利用一部分土地，一面實騐，一面生產，雖不能自給自足，但也不無裨助。</p>
<p>（二）實騐所辦事人員中，不乏學養有素，熱心研究，埋首工作者，如顧心梅王歷農諸氏皆係農學界有數學者，且均極願畢生致力於本位工作。但因生活所迫，不得不另謀兼職，精力分散，在個人方面則極感痛苦，在工作效率上自亦大爲降低。所以，該所對於實際工作的幹部，無論如何，應給予解決一身一家生活的待遇，使能畢其精力，安心工作，而無後顧之憂。</p>
<p>（三）該所推進實騐工作，需要勞力頗多，而現有工人因待遇較差，無法安心。因此，對於工人待遇，也應合理提高，並在工資以外，另予日用品廉價配給。最低限度不被視作副業，減低工作效率。</p>
<p>最後，我們更希望盟邦在技術上資材上，予以協助。今春本報等主辦之戰時學術講座，首聘講師盟邦農業專家佐佐木博士，來華演講，即對農業增產特別重視。亟盼主管當局切實設法，俾於農業增產有所實效。</p>

<h3 id="c6">中央農業實騐所參觀記 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>年來復興農村和增加生產之聲，高唱入　，各方寄予莫大期待，這機關係國家前途的重大事業，在計劃上固然要妥善縝密，籌畫周詳，但在達到成功之途的重要條件—農事技術的改進—上面，亦非以極端重視不可。因此，記者特地參觀了一次中央農業實騐所。</p>
<p>老敎授談往事</p>
<p>該所在南京迤東江寗縣　之孝陵街。經過　陵街鎭約里許，即望見該所大門　立眼前。桐蔭引出一條大路，路右所植者皆爲樹苗，約有十餘畝，路左所植者爲豆科植物，有大豆菉豆等，間亦胡麻類作物，皆爲實騐之用，亦有十餘畝，略視以後，進該所辦公處內，詢知所長爲實業部農林署署長陳燕山氏兼任，副所長爲有名育種專家沈壽佺氏，皆已因公外出，閣者囑記者稍待於會客室中，記者遍觀陳設，皆頗樸實。座旁一溫文老者，經叩談知爲名敎授稻作專家顧心梅氏，現充該所食用作物系主任，顧氏執敎鞭於京滬各大學，爲一熱心敎育人士，談及一切情形，深爲太息，謂該所在事變前，已有相當規模與歷史，當時佔地二千餘畝，事變時房屋多燬於火，現時辦公室爲重建者，土地則一部分已移作他用，一部分則以勞力不足任其荒蕪，所餘僅一千六百六十畝，亦未能充分利用。談到食用作物系工作，則謂食用作物系之範圍，普通限稻麥兩種。馬鈴薯，山芋等則爲次要者，現際戰戰時原料工具均感缺乏，故大批試騐工作不能着手，目前僅作品種比較實騐，栽培方法改良等工作。今年江南稻多受螟害，就無錫一地而論，高者竟至全部白穗無米可收。此種情形，實未可忽視，現正試行早稻栽培以避　害，結果或可成功。記者詢及該所現尚擁有地千餘畝，能自給自足否？顧氏謂「若在鄕下人手中，有十餘畝田地，即能維持入口之家生活，他們的自身勞力則不計算在內，公家境關則本身勞力有限，又無機械使用，僱用人工支出浩大，關於僱工一層，尤覺雜難太多。蓋以當地農人皆各自有田，農閒則願來，農忙即想去，甚至本所僱用之長工，在晨忙期間情願罰金而吿似，差不多來本所作工者，視作副業，且無相當之下級幹部人材管理，以致儸工多貪懶，對工作不緊張，以及其他種稱人事關係，自給自足，非但無望，且時感不足。」說到這裏，該所總務任主任束煜光氏出見。</p>
<p>東主任談近情</p>
<p>據束氏說，該所現有所長副所長各一人，下設秘書總務二室，此外皆爲技術方面，有工藝作物系，食用作物系，畜產系，土壤肥料系，植物病虫害系，及林產組，園薩組，蠶桑組三組，最近或將震桑組歸併於鎭江蠶桑學校。又大勝關，堯化門兩棉產機關，則有歸併於本所之說。再爲謀家畜之保育與增殖起見，擬在上海設立一獸醫血淸製造所，另有一農場管理處，處理本年農地場務，工人長工不滿一百人，短工則因事務之業簡，人數每日不同，職員則有一百餘人，記者復問到事業費時，束氏答稱該所每月雖領到百餘萬元，但以事務費爲多，事業費尚不及百分之二十，嗣乃陪同記者參觀各部，熱情至足紉感。</p>
<p>各室工作情形</p>
<p>第一室—農場管理處—該所爲實騐機關，所有田間實騐工作，均由各系組個別進行，所餘之土地，約佔全農塲百分之六十，則歸該處經營，作爲良種繁殖及普通栽培之用，惟各系親所需要之勞力，農具，肥料，稱子等，則爲該處供給，各種農產品亦歸該處支配，該處辦事人稱，若爲事實及財力所許，當改善並充實工人勞力，並添築堆肥舍與肥料池，以增進土壤之肥力</p>
<p>第二室—食用作物系—主持者係顧心梅氏，上面已經說過，記者進該室時，正見顧氏忙於小麥栽培方法試騐及蠶豆品種觀察，未便多擾，隨即退出。</p>
<p>第三室—畜產系—主持者爲前中央大學農學院長陸錫君氏，惜因公出，未及晤談，該室正在進行之工作，爲使美利諾羊興中國綿羊雜交，以期獲得優種，而媒羊毛之增產。該室技土某君復吿記者，謂戰時羊毛需要量更大，以絨綫一磅而論，即需萬餘元，然吾國綿羊不惟產毛不豐，並且粗硬而織維短，美利諾羊則無比缺點，但其在繁殖上，不如吾國綿羊，實行雜交以後，質旣改善量亦增產。</p>
<p>第四室—土壤肥料系—議系主任亦已公出，由技士周君說明正在從事增加有機物改良土性之試騐情形（即於地面先行播種植物，然後翻之入土再種作物，即俗構壓靑者是），按我國有很多地方，農人種田，不施用肥料，或施用肥料，亦祗限於人糞尿，豆餅等數種，而期望收獲則惟恐不多，事實上則年年減，故人造肥料之配給，及使用方法敎導，當局似應注意及之。</p>
<p>第五室—爲植物物病虫害系與蠶桑組之合室—以養養期已過，蠶桑組無甚研究工作，病虫害系係由著名昆虫學家王歷農氏主持，惜王氏口赴滬，未及晤談，惟其室內工作緊張情形，實堪一記。譬如稻螟案稱難治，多年任其猖獗，該室正在進行螟卵寄生蜂之研究。據技士某君謂螟卵過小而多，無法採捕，以之聽其化蛾爲害，今乃自國外，採集一種赤卵蜂，此蜂體甚小，產卵繁殖每喜產卵於螟卵之中，於是孵化於螟卵中之螟胎則爲其食盡，在物雖爲相殘，在人寶爲除螟之無上方策，言來頗饒趣味。</p>
<p>其他如森林組，農榮經濟組，農業推廣組等，皆能努力於本位工作。至是內部各室，均經瀏覽，束氏復引導巡視塲地。計有溫室二，蔬菜區二，據稱一部分蔬菜區，爲該所同人家屬合作經營以謀自給，適有一白髮老人偕同二幼童正從從事虫工作，謂即某職員之父及其二子也。最後乃參觀收塲，見有牛舍，羊舍，鶏棚，猪圈，畜類則有荷蘭牛，良種猪，美利諾羊。（寄自南京）</p>

<p>桂林二十八日中央社電　據貴州前綫日軍基地二十八日電，日軍目攻時柳州後，爲粉碎渝軍幻想，共第一綫部隊刻正勢如破竹，沿西北地區進攻黔桂鐵路兩側，目下已突入貴州省境，切斷防衛廣西省渝軍直轄部隊第（九十三）軍曁（二十）（二十八）（四六）（九三）等四軍指揮系統，已全部陷於混亂狀態，日軍近陣地攻擊戰已一變而爲追擊戰，渝軍現已退至都匀獨山地帶。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日中國派遣軍有力部隊迫追貴州省境，與南寗陷落之日，突破該省南端天險黎明關，向貴州平原進攻，日軍自柳州向貴省境內追擊渝軍，十五日以來連日衝過宜山，思愚全域各要團突破省境，終於二十四日突破貴州省南部要塞黎明關，衝入貴州平原，現正繼續追擊中。日軍突進貴州省境後，自中日事變以來貴州向爲重慶培養戰力之基地，阻撓日軍進攻，至是已置於日軍面前，予渝軍之銜動至爲深刻。貴州省內現駐有第三十五集團軍·第二十七集團軍·及第十六集團軍等三個集團軍，該三個集團軍均受日軍猛擊，戰力消耗甚多。重慶方面受日軍如此猛擊，惟有以微弱戰力抗戰，其狼狽情形可見一般。渝方早曾表示日本將進攻貴陽，以現在重慶戰力，實難阻止日軍前進。重慶處此苦境之中，自九月上旬至十一月中旬大陸戰綫之戰果，據傳　業屍體及俘虜等合計五萬七千二百名，鹵獲火砲四百十一門，輕重機關槍一千三百四十五挺，可知柳桂攻略戰所予重慶打擊如何重大，且鹵獲飛機十八架，車頭十八輛，客車九百十六輛，汽車戰車等六十二輛，實中日事變以來未有之戰果云。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　國府新民運促進會，日本增產視察團一行九人，自抵日以來已歷一月，茲該團以視察完畢，業於二十四日由下關乘船返國。據該團團長周森氏談其感想如次：</p>
<p>今次視察之感想，綜合言之，可分爲五點。（一）昔我等曾懷疑日本於戰爭中是否有食糧廣乏之處，但此次至各地視察時，目睹日本農民工作之努力及收穫之豐富，遂肯定日本絕無食糧恐慌。（二）自大東亞戰爭爆發後，日本國民大多出征前綫，故後方之增產工作人員，則多半由日靑少年團員及各大中學生代之，其中最值注目者，即日本婦女工作效率之大，決不亞於男子，此乃平素已養成勤苦耐勞之良善習慣所致。（三）日靑少年團員訓練之猛烈及其苦幹精神，實令人欽佩，雖至冷風襲人之時，然彼等仍赤首踝足而操練及在稻中工作。（四）日靑少年團員之勤勞，服務勞動工作指導者，實有莫大關係，蓋指導者能奉公克已，以身作則，事事率光垂範，故被指導者當不致怠情偷閑也。</p>
<p>（五）日本全國均呈緊張氣象，全國民衆莫不克忠職守，努力不怠，所謂閑情逸致之情早行絕跡，目下日本軍官民於團結一致之下，無不奮鬬苦幹報效國家，以期獲得最後勝利。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Air Force Continues Attacks: Enemy Airfields on Morotai and Leyte Islands; Yasukuni Special Unit Sinks Four Enemy Ships <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 28th: On the evenings of the 24th and 25th, Japanese air units continuously attacked enemy airfields on Morotai Island and Leyte Island, as well as enemy ships within Leyte Gulf, achieving the following results: (1) Over eleven fires broke out on Morotai Island (including two major fires). (2) Runways and facilities at Tacloban and Dulag airfields on Leyte Island were destroyed or set ablaze in multiple locations. (3) Three enemy transport ships in Leyte Gulf caught fire, and two ships of unknown type were destroyed. Six Japanese aircraft were lost in the operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 27th: (1) The Yasukuni Anti-Piracy Unit of the Japanese Special Attack Force conducted decisive attacks on large enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on November 24th and 26th, destroying four of them. The participants in these attacks were as follows: Sergeant Murakami Narito of the Army participated on November 24th; Lieutenant Ichio Demaru of the Army, Lieutenant Masahiro Tanigawa of the Army, and Sergeant Kengo Kinoshita of the Army participated on November 26th. (2) On the night of November 26th, Japanese air units conducted a long-range bombing raid on Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island, bombing enemy B-29 aircraft concentrated on the southern side of the runway. Multiple aircraft were hit and caught fire, and over ten aircraft were destroyed. Two fires also broke out. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Hakkō Unit Launches Fierce Daytime Assault</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army Special Attack Force launched another fierce assault on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf throughout the day on the 27th. Dozens of enemy ships were sunk, struck, or set ablaze. On the morning of the 27th, the Hakkō Unit of the Army Special Attack Force, under the escort of fighter planes, sorties toward Leyte Gulf. Seven Japanese planes daringly advanced and carried out direct strike attacks on enemy ships, sinking one large ship (believed to be a battleship), four large transport ships, and severely damaging one large ship (battleship or large cruiser) that caught fire, and more than one large transport ship. All these results were confirmed by Japanese escorting aircraft. In addition, three enemy aircraft, fearing the Japanese attack, evaded by making high-speed turns. The Japanese forces then started to carry out sure-hit attacks on three enemy large cruisers. When friendly aircraft hit the enemy ships, Petty Officers 1st Class Kumasaka and Ketsuzaki of the Japanese escorting planes retreated into the clouds. After emerging from the clouds again, the three enemy large cruisers had sunk to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Naval Aviation Establishes Distinguished Service</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The reputation of the Japanese Navy's new bomber "Comet" and the new attack aircraft "Galaxy" has spread far and wide. The "Comet" is a single-engine aircraft, and the "Galaxy" is a twin-engine aircraft. The performance of both machines is excellent, and their speed is so fast that the enemy is extremely shocked when the Japanese Air Force sortied with both aircraft bombing together. Both "Comet" and "Galaxy" aircraft participated in the air battle over the waters of Taiwan in the middle of last month. They also participated in operations together with Zero fighters in the attacks by the Kamikaze Special Attack Force on enemy ships around the Philippines. At present, in the air battles around the Philippines, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force is establishing immortal achievements every time the "Comet" and "Galaxy" aircraft participate.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle Unfolds on Leyte</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle on Leyte Island is currently centered on the eastern foothills of the Yagu mountain range on the island and the western region of Carigara Bay. The intensity of the fighting is increasing daily. Both sides are mobilizing their main forces, and the atmosphere of a decisive battle is rising every moment. The struggle for air supremacy above the battlefield and the transportation and resupply battles around the war zone are also becoming increasingly active. The Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Forces have repeatedly sortied, ramming enemy ships with fearless flesh-and-blood attacks, seizing the enemy's courage and shattering their spirits.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Night Attack on Samar Island</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the day and night battles on Leyte Island, a portion of the Japanese force landed on Samar Island near the opposite shore of Tacloban some time ago and advanced westward along the island's coast. By the 11th, they had advanced to the vicinity of Pinabacdao. The Japanese army, which had been standing by, launched a fierce counterattack from the 12th. On the 14th, they carried out a brave night attack. The enemy was suddenly attacked by the Japanese army and retreated to the vicinity of Kabiga, ten kilometers south of Pinabacdao, where they are currently constructing defensive positions. There has been no active advance since then. In addition, although the enemy has been publicizing that a large force has landed on Samar Island, its actual strength is only about one regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, and its equipment consists only of mortars.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Aircraft Bomb Saipan, Repeatedly Achieve Great Results <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy B-29 aircraft took off from the Marianas and raided Longchuan, Manchukuo, on the 24th. They also invaded the skies over Tokyo on the 27th, but were fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft and fled in disarray. In contrast, the Japanese Air Force launched preemptive bombing raids on Saipan on November 3rd and 7th, and then launched a third attack on Saipan Island on the 26th, achieving great results. The Japanese bomber squadron, on the 26th, used moonlight to reach the enemy base on Saipan Island and took advantage of the enemy's shift on Sunday, carrying out a precise bombing raid on the main airfield, Aslito, at that base. They separately eliminated the enemy's anti-aircraft barrage and the obstruction of enemy fighter planes, dropping bombs on enemy B-29 aircraft gathered in the southern part of the airfield. As a result, several enemy B-29 aircraft were burned and over ten were damaged. In addition, Japanese aircraft set two enemy facilities ablaze. The Japanese aircraft, after achieving their objectives, triumphantly returned.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Rainy Season in Burma is Over; Warfare Becomes More Intense; Chungking Forces Near Bhamo Repelled <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Burmese front has gradually become more active as the rainy season has ended. In particular, since the middle of this month, the offensive by the Chungking forces has become more intense. The Japanese army is also launching counterattacks everywhere. At the same time, the Chungking forces on the Myitkyina front have retreated to the north. The battle situation in each of these areas is recorded below. (1) The newly organized 30th and 38th Divisions of the Chungking forces in northern Burma advanced to within five kilometers of Bhamo since the 16th and launched an attack from three directions. The Japanese garrison on that side bravely intercepted them and has now repelled them. In addition, the newly organized 22nd Division of the Chungking forces crossed the Irrawaddy River from the Shwegu area and attempted to advance further south, but was thwarted because it was crushed by the Japanese army everywhere. At present, Bhamo is still in the hands of the Japanese army. On the Myitkyina front, the Japanese army continues its fierce attacks. The British Indian army, after suffering heavy losses, has retreated to the north. (2) The Japanese army in the Kalewa area is currently gradually reorganizing its battle lines. At the same time, it is still firmly defending the area around Kalemyo and 30 kilometers north of Kalewa. They are currently confronting the enemy. (3) The enemy's 81st West African Division in the Kaladan area is gradually gathering its forces in the Paletwa area, but there are no major changes in the battle line in that area. The same is true in the Buthidaung area.</p>
<p>Burmese Front Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force in Burma launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Myitkyina, northern Burma, on the night of the 25th, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire to repeatedly attack. Seven locations were hit and caught fire. Enemy aircraft and ancillary facilities on the ground were heavily damaged. Enemy fighters attempted to intercept but were repelled. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Improving Agricultural Experimentation Work <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>This year is the year of increased production. Eleven months of the year have already passed. What are the results of the increased production? We have tried to review it, and it is feared that the statistical figures have not increased. In the agricultural sector, the harvest in some areas is not good. In the industrial sector, raw materials and power are limited. Therefore, the year of increased production is only a nominal term.</p>
<p>Regarding increased agricultural production, to achieve actual results, three conditions must be met: first, timing; second, environment; and third, technology. The former is natural, and the latter two are man-made. However, human effort can compensate for natural deficiencies, such as spraying water in times of drought. If human effort is lacking, even good timing will be in vain. Therefore, the man-made environment and technology are two major factors in increasing agricultural production.</p>
<p>The so-called environment belongs to the political sphere, such as the establishment of public security, which allows farmers to focus on cultivation; the elimination of arbitrary taxes and levies, which reduces the suffering of farmers; the so-called technology belongs to the scientific sphere, such as the improvement of cultivation methods, the improvement of cultivation tools, the prevention of diseases and pests, and the selection of seeds. Therefore, increased production is a practical task, not a theoretical problem. At the same time, it is a continuous task, not one that can be accomplished overnight.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that if we talk about increased agricultural production, we must first gradually achieve progress in the environment and technology. In terms of technological research, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station should bear considerable responsibility. Recently, a reporter dispatched by this newspaper to inspect various places visited the station and reported on the current working conditions of the station (see today's travel communication). After reading the visitor's notes, we deeply feel that the work of the station is limited by funding and cannot fulfill its due mission. Therefore, it contributes very little to the improvement of agricultural technology and does not meet the conditions for increasing agricultural production. We hope that the relevant authorities will improve it in practice. Here, we offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Experimental institutions are not administrative institutions and absolutely require practical work, especially the demonstration and utilization of results. They must not be regarded as dispensable government offices, merely assigning a few personnel. Necessary business expenses should be increased as much as possible, but must be absolutely used for business purposes, so that all technical work can be advanced in sequence according to the pre-planned plan. Other administrative expenses should be found separately and also increased. At the same time, the experimental station must also adapt to the environment, organize and utilize part of the land for experimentation and production. Although it cannot be self-sufficient, it will be helpful.</p>
<p>(2) Among the staff of the experimental station, there are many who are well-educated, enthusiastic about research, and dedicated to their work, such as Gu Xinmei and Wang Linong, who are both scholars in the agricultural field and are very willing to devote their lives to their work. However, due to the pressure of life, they have to seek other part-time jobs, and their energy is dispersed. On a personal level, they feel extremely painful, and the work efficiency is greatly reduced. Therefore, the station should provide cadres who are engaged in practical work with a level of treatment that can solve their family's livelihood, so that they can devote their energy and work with peace of mind, without any worries.</p>
<p>(3) The station needs a lot of labor to promote experimental work, but the existing workers cannot work with peace of mind due to the poor treatment. Therefore, the treatment of workers should also be reasonably improved, and cheap distribution of daily necessities should be given in addition to wages. At the very least, they should not be regarded as side jobs, which would reduce work efficiency.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the allied countries will provide assistance in terms of technology and materials. During the wartime academic lectures organized by this newspaper and others this spring, Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from the allied countries, was hired as the first lecturer to come to China to give lectures, which attached special importance to increased agricultural production. We hope that the competent authorities will take practical measures to ensure that increased agricultural production has practical results.</p>

<h3 id="e6">A Visit to the Central Agricultural Experiment Station <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>In recent years, the voices of revitalizing rural areas and increasing production have been sung loudly, and all parties have placed great expectations on them. This is a major undertaking related to the future of the country. The plans must be properly and meticulously developed, and the improvement of agricultural technology, which is an important condition for achieving success, must be given extreme importance. Therefore, the reporter specially visited the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>
<p>An Old Professor Talks About the Past</p>
<p>The station is located on Xiaoling Street in Jiangning County, east of Nanjing. After passing through Xiaoling Street Town for about a mile, the gate of the station came into sight. A paulownia tree led to a large road. The right side of the road was planted with saplings, about ten acres in size. The left side of the road was planted with leguminous plants, such as soybeans and mung beans, as well as sesame crops, all for experimental purposes, also about ten acres in size. After a brief look, I entered the station's office and learned that the director was Chen Yanshan, director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry, and the deputy director was Shen Shouquan, a famous breeding expert. Both had gone out on official business. The cabinet asked the reporter to wait in the reception room. The reporter looked around at the furnishings, which were all very simple. A gentle old man was sitting next to him. After inquiring, I learned that he was Gu Xinmei, a famous professor and rice expert, who is currently the director of the Food Crop Department of the station. Mr. Gu taught at universities in Beijing and Shanghai and is an enthusiastic educator. Speaking of all the circumstances, he sighed deeply, saying that the station had a considerable scale and history before the incident. At that time, it occupied more than 2,000 acres of land. During the incident, most of the houses were destroyed by fire. The current office building was rebuilt, and part of the land has been transferred to other uses, and part of it has been left to lie fallow due to insufficient labor. Only 1,660 acres remain, which have not been fully utilized. Speaking of the work of the Food Crop Department, he said that the scope of the Food Crop Department is generally limited to rice and wheat. Potatoes, yams, etc. are secondary. Now, in wartime, raw materials and tools are lacking, so a large number of experimental works cannot be started. Currently, only variety comparison experiments and cultivation method improvement work are being carried out. This year, rice in Jiangnan has suffered a lot from rice borers. Taking Wuxi as an example, in severe cases, the entire field has white ears and no rice can be harvested. This situation should not be ignored. Early rice cultivation is currently being tested to avoid the harm, and the results may be successful. The reporter asked whether the station currently owns more than 1,000 acres of land and can be self-sufficient. Mr. Gu said, "If in the hands of a villager, ten acres of land can maintain the life of a family, and their own labor is not counted. The public sector has limited labor and no mechanical use. The expenditure on hiring labor is huge. Regarding the hiring of labor, there are too many difficulties. Because local farmers all have their own fields, they are willing to come during the slack season, and they want to leave during the busy season. Even the long-term workers employed by the station are willing to pay fines and ask for leave during the busy season. Almost everyone who comes to work at the station regards it as a side job, and there is no adequate lower-level cadre to manage it, so that many laborers are lazy and not serious about their work, and there are other kinds of personal relationships. Self-sufficiency is not only hopeless, but also often feels insufficient." Speaking of this, the director of general affairs, Shu Yuguang, came out to see us.</p>
<p>Director Shu Talks About Recent Situation</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shu, the station currently has one director and one deputy director each. There are two offices under them: the Secretary's Office and the General Affairs Office. In addition, there are technical departments, including the Industrial Crop Department, the Food Crop Department, the Animal Husbandry Department, the Soil Fertilizer Department, the Plant Disease and Pest Department, and the Forestry Group, the Garden Group, and the Sericulture Group. Recently, the Sericulture Group may be merged with the Zhenjiang Sericulture School. In addition, there is a saying that the Dashengguan and Yaohuamen cotton production agencies will be merged with the station. Furthermore, in order to protect and increase the number of domestic animals, it is planned to establish a veterinary serum manufacturing plant in Shanghai. There is also a farm management office to handle this year's agricultural land affairs. There are fewer than 100 workers and long-term workers. The number of short-term workers varies from day to day depending on the amount of work. There are more than 100 staff members. The reporter asked about the business expenses. Mr. Shu replied that although the station receives more than one million yuan per month, most of it is for administrative expenses, and the business expenses are less than 20 percent. Later, he accompanied the reporter to visit various departments with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Work of Each Room</p>
<p>Room 1 - Farm Management Office - The station is an experimental institution, and all field experimental work is carried out by each department and group separately. The remaining land, accounting for about 60 percent of the total farm, is managed by the office for the purpose of breeding improved varieties and general cultivation. However, the labor, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, etc. required by each department and group are provided by the office, and various agricultural products are also under the control of the office. The person in charge of the office said that if the facts and financial resources permit, they will improve and enrich the workers' labor, and add compost sheds and fertilizer pools to increase the fertility of the soil.</p>
<p>Room 2 - Food Crop Department - Hosted by Gu Xinmei, as mentioned above. When the reporter entered the room, he saw Mr. Gu busy with wheat cultivation method experiments and broad bean variety observations, so he did not bother him and withdrew.</p>
<p>Room 3 - Animal Husbandry Department - Hosted by Lu Xijun, the former dean of the College of Agriculture of National Central University. Unfortunately, he was out on official business and could not meet him. The work being carried out in the room is to cross Merino sheep with Chinese sheep in order to obtain superior breeds and increase wool production. A technician in the room also told the reporter that the demand for wool is greater in wartime. Taking one pound of worsted yarn as an example, it costs more than 10,000 yuan. However, Chinese sheep not only do not produce abundant wool, but also are coarse and the woven fiber is short. Merino sheep have no comparable shortcomings, but their reproduction is not as good as that of Chinese sheep. After crossbreeding, the quality will be improved and the quantity will increase.</p>
<p>Room 4 - Soil Fertilizer Department - The department head had also gone out on official business, so technician Zhou explained the experimental situation of increasing organic matter and improving soil properties (that is, sowing plants on the ground first, then turning them into the soil and then planting crops, which is commonly called green manure). According to him, in many places in China, farmers do not apply fertilizer when planting crops, or if they do, they are limited to using human manure and bean cakes, and they expect to harvest as much as possible. In fact, the harvest decreases year by year, so the authorities should pay attention to the allocation of artificial fertilizers and the teaching of their use.</p>
<p>Room 5 - A combined room for the Plant Disease and Pest Department and the Sericulture Group - Since the silkworm rearing period has passed, the Sericulture Group has no research work. The Disease and Pest Department is hosted by Wang Linong, a famous entomologist. Unfortunately, Mr. Wang went to Shanghai and could not meet him, but the tense working situation in his room is worth recording. For example, rice borers are difficult to treat and have been rampant for many years. The room is conducting research on rice borer egg parasitic wasps. According to a technician, rice borer eggs are too small and numerous to be captured, so they are allowed to hatch into moths and cause harm. Now, a kind of Trichogramma wasp is collected from abroad. This wasp is very small and likes to lay eggs in rice borer eggs. Then, the rice borer larva hatched in the rice borer egg will be eaten by it. Although it is cannibalism in the object, it is a sure-fire strategy for humans to eliminate rice borers. The speech was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Other groups, such as the Forestry Group, the Agricultural Economics Group, and the Agricultural Extension Group, are all working hard in their positions. After browsing all the rooms inside, Mr. Shu led a tour of the fields. There are two greenhouses and two vegetable areas. It is said that part of the vegetable area is jointly operated by the staff and their families to make a living. There was an old man with white hair and two young children working on insect work. He said that he was the father and his two sons of a staff member. Finally, I visited the harvesting field and saw cattle sheds, sheep sheds, chicken coops, pig pens, and livestock such as Dutch cattle, improved breed pigs, and Merino sheep. (Sent from Nanjing)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Troops in Guizhou Province Reach Phoenix Ridge; Great Achievements in Three Months <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Guizhou Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A rapid unit of the Japanese army broke through the border of Guizhou Province on the night of the 27th, entered a 13-kilometer area within Guizhou Province, traversed Phoenix Ridge, and is continuing its advance.</p>
<p>Guilin, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from the Japanese army base on the Guizhou front on the 28th, after the Japanese army attacked Liuzhou, in order to crush the Chungking forces' illusions, the first-line units are now advancing rapidly, attacking both sides of the Qian-Gui Railway in the northwest region. At present, they have broken into Guizhou Province, cutting off the command system of the 93rd Army, which is directly under the Guangxi Provincial Defense Chungking Forces, and the 20th, 28th, 46th, and 93rd Armies, all of which have fallen into a state of confusion. The Japanese army's close-quarters assault has changed into a pursuit war. The Chungking forces have now retreated to the Duyun-Dushan area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Powerful units of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force are pursuing into Guizhou Province. On the day of the fall of Nanning, they broke through the natural barrier of Limingguan at the southern end of the province and advanced to the Guizhou Plain. The Japanese army pursued the Chungking forces from Liuzhou into Guizhou Province. Since the 15th, they have broken through the provincial border in the Yishan and Siyu areas, and finally broke through Limingguan, a key fortress in southern Guizhou Province, on the 24th, rushing into the Guizhou Plain and continuing to pursue. After the Japanese army's sudden entry into Guizhou Province, Guizhou has been a base for Chongqing to cultivate its military strength and hinder the Japanese army's offensive since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Now it has been placed in front of the Japanese army, giving a very profound blow to the Chungking forces. Three group armies are currently stationed in Guizhou Province: the 35th Group Army, the 27th Group Army, and the 16th Group Army. All three group armies have been heavily attacked by the Japanese army and have suffered a great loss of combat power. Chongqing can only fight back with weak combat power under such a fierce attack by the Japanese army. The situation is generally chaotic. The Chongqing side had previously stated that Japan would attack Guiyang. With Chongqing's current combat power, it is difficult to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Chongqing is in such a difficult situation that, according to reports, the results of the continental front from early September to mid-November include a total of 57,200 enemy corpses and prisoners, 411 artillery pieces, and 1,345 light and heavy machine guns. It can be seen how significant the blows to Chongqing were in the Liuzhou-Guilin campaign. Moreover, 18 aircraft, 18 locomotives, 916 passenger cars, and 62 automobiles and tanks were captured, which is an unprecedented achievement since the Sino-Japanese Incident.</p>
<p>Air Supremacy is in the Hands of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>South China Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The chief of the press department of the Japanese army in South China issued the following statement at 2:00 PM on the 26th regarding the battle situation after the occupation of Nanning: After the Japanese army occupied Liuzhou, they continued to advance westward, pursuing the main force of the Chungking forces. At present, they have captured Nanning in one fell swoop. The US Air Force base in the Guilin-Liuzhou area has been completely destroyed. The significance of the Japanese army's control of air supremacy in China is quite significant in the war. The key to the success of this operation was the Japanese army's ability to overcome ground difficulties and demonstrate rapid mobility. The US Air Force is sacrificing China to carry out its ambition of invading East Asia, and its tyranny has aroused the resentment of the Chinese people. During the operation, the Japanese army maintained strict military discipline and explained the East Asian situation and the purpose of the operation to the Chinese people in detail, which won the understanding of the evacuated people, who unanimously returned to assist the Japanese army. At present, the air supremacy in southern China is entirely in the hands of the Japanese army. Although the US Air Force has retreated to Kunming and Chengdu, the destruction of these bases is also a matter of time.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Will Be Expanded Commemoration <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - December 8th is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.

<h3 id="e9">Head of the New Life Movement Inspection Group Discusses Impressions of Visiting Japan: The Japanese People are Full of Hardworking Spirit <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The New Life Movement Promotion Association of the National Government, a Japanese Production Increase Inspection Group of nine people, has been in Japan for a month since their arrival. Now that the inspection is complete, the group took a ship from Shimonoseki on the 24th to return to China. According to Mr. Zhou Sen, the head of the group, his impressions are as follows:</p>
<p>The impressions of this inspection can be summarized into five points. (1) In the past, we suspected whether Japan had widespread food shortages during the war, but this time, after visiting various places and witnessing the efforts of Japanese farmers and the abundance of harvests, we are certain that Japan has no food panic. (2) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, most Japanese citizens have gone to the front lines. Therefore, most of the production increase workers in the rear are replaced by Japanese youth group members and major middle school students. Among them, what is most noteworthy is the efficiency of Japanese women's work, which is by no means inferior to that of men. This is due to the good habit of being diligent and enduring hardship. (3) The intensity of the training of Japanese youth group members and their hardworking spirit are truly admirable. Even when cold winds are blowing, they are still barefoot and bareheaded, practicing and working in the rice paddies. (4) The diligence of Japanese youth group members and the labor service guidance workers are greatly related, because the instructors can be selfless and disciplined, lead by example, and serve as a model in everything, so that those who are guided will not be lazy or idle.</p>
<p>(5) The whole of Japan presents a tense atmosphere, and all citizens are loyal to their duties and work hard without slackening. The so-called leisurely and carefree feelings have long disappeared. At present, Japanese military officers and civilians are united and fighting hard to serve the country, hoping to achieve final victory.</p>

<p>Opening Speech by Chairman Wen Lanting: "Dear members: Today, our association is holding its fourth members' general meeting. I am very pleased that you are all participating enthusiastically despite your busy schedules. Our association was established in response to the needs of the citizens of Shanghai. For the past two years, we have received the enthusiastic assistance of all members and people from all walks of life, and the affairs of the association have been thriving. In the future, we will resolutely follow the established policy and move forward, seeking genuine welfare for the citizens of Shanghai in all aspects. The various important matters recently handled by our association are detailed in the association's report, so I will not repeat them here. However, the scope of social welfare undertakings is extremely broad, and due to limited finances and the limited capabilities of our colleagues, and because we are all engaged in our own duties, it is not easy to fully satisfy the expectations of the citizens, but we will do our best to do what we can. Today, there are other proposals to be submitted to the meeting for discussion. These proposals are all related to the welfare of the citizens and urgently need to be carried out. I hope that all of you will discuss them enthusiastically and formulate concrete plans to implement them quickly. The original number of members of our association was 100. Previously, in order to strengthen the association's affairs, the board of directors decided to solicit another 100 new members, making a total of 200. In this way, with the strength of the masses, the affairs of the association will surely have continuous development. Currently, 43 new members have been recruited, all of whom are people of high reputation from all walks of life in this city and enthusiastic about public welfare. There are still 57 fewer, and we are still soliciting them. Looking forward to the future of our association, it is full of light and hope. I hope that all of you will work hard to serve our association with the intention of relieving the hunger and suffering of others, so as to benefit the citizens. I wish you all good health."</p>

<h3 id="e22">Carrying Out the Chairman's Will: A Letter to the People from the Chinese Kuomintang <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang issued a letter to the people in order to carry out the Chairman's will: The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The development of the National Revolution, from the late Qing Dynasty's Yiyou Year (1905) to the present, has been nearly sixty years. During these sixty years, our party comrades and revolutionary people have been nurtured by our General Sun Yat-sen, and subsequently encouraged by our Chairman Wang Jingwei. They have been able to avoid difficulties and dangers, and fight to the death with evil and corrupt forces. The revolutionary movement has continued to advance, and has continued to encounter setbacks. The most significant blows were the death of the creator of the Republic of China, our party's General Sun Yat-sen, in 1925, and the death of the Head of State, our party's Chairman Wang Jingwei, twenty years later today. At a time when the great cause of peace, anti-communism, and national construction has not yet been fully completed, and the East Asian national liberation struggle is in full swing, the revolution has lost its teacher, the people have lost their reliance, and East Asia has lost a pillar. This is truly a major misfortune for our party, and an irreparable loss for our country and East Asia. Our party comrades, the people of the whole country, and people in East Asia, are all weeping and mourning. In the midst of bewilderment and anxiety, we urgently want to inherit their legacy to comfort the spirits of our General and our Chairman in heaven. The work left unfinished by the General was continued and led by the Chairman. The work left unfinished by the Chairman is now completely entrusted to our shoulders. Looking around the world, the country is fragmented, the flames of war have not yet subsided, the obstacles to unification still exist, and the suffering of the people is already deep. With dangers ahead, how can we break through? With heavy responsibilities and a long road ahead, how can we bear them? Our party comrades, encountering this great tragedy, observe the overall situation externally and examine the national conditions internally, and increasingly feel the arduousness of our mission. Therefore, with the unanimous resolution of the Central Executive Committee, we strengthen our belief, carry out the legacy, and announce to the compatriots of the whole country, the people of East Asia, and the people of the world:</p>
<p>Launch a Mass Movement, Gather Revolutionary Armed Forces</p>
<p>Our Chairman was a revolutionary hero for the country and the successor to the General for the party. During the General's lifetime, he assisted him on the left and right, shouldered heavy responsibilities, promoted the interpretation of his ideas, advanced party affairs, and planned the revolutionary struggle, sharing hardships and not complaining. After the General's death, the Chairman accepted the will, led the comrades, and continued the struggle. Because of this, there was the establishment of party discipline, the launching of mass movements, the gathering of revolutionary armed forces, and the establishment of the National Government. It was originally hoped that the Northern Expedition would be successful, unification would be in sight, and the revolutionary movement could move from the first half of the struggle against the internal forces to the second half of the struggle against the external forces, in order to realize our party's long-cherished wish to seek freedom and equality for China and to strive for independence and liberation for Asia. Unexpectedly, just as the revolution was entering its climax, it became the most dangerous time of crisis. The remaining forces of feudalism took advantage of it to corrupt the essence of the revolution, the communists took advantage of it to split the revolutionary camp, and the imperialists took advantage of it to stifle the progress of the revolution. Changes occurred frequently, and eventually evolved into a situation of intertwined internal and external troubles since the 16th and 17th years (1927 and 1928). (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Personnel Changes in the Police Bureau <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>

Wang Guan, Director of the Baojia Section of the Laozha Sub-bureau, has resigned and his resignation has been approved. The vacancy will be filled by Zong Youlin, a first-class police officer of the Xincheng Sub-bureau. Cai Liu, Deputy Captain of the Second Team of the Police Corps, has been transferred to the Director of the Baojia Section of the Huashan Road Sub-bureau. The vacancy will be filled by Feng Jinsheng, a first-class police officer of the Tilanqiao Sub-bureau. The above-mentioned personnel have all reported to work yesterday.

<h3 id="e24">Police Bureau Fingerprint Fee Correction Collection Method <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Judicial Department of the Supervisory Bureau of this city has submitted a temporary method for collecting public funds for the Jianzhi Section to the Municipal Government for instructions to make appropriate revisions and implement them strictly. The main points of this method are extracted as follows: The scope of appraisal is limited to fingerprints, Chinese and Western handwriting, and weapons. Government agencies that need appraisal for official business may request free fingerprint appraisal. Collection Method for Public Funds. Because the tricyclist is a private business, the section shall press his fingerprints and check whether he has a previous record when he receives the license to determine whether to keep him. The cost of paper, ink, soap, and inspection procedures is 30 yuan per person. Other carters, pimps, petitioners, privately employed tricyclists, and privately employed car drivers are charged 100 yuan per person for the same reasons as above. Business-employed car drivers are charged 50 yuan per person, and rickshaw pullers are charged 10 yuan per person. For private requests to investigate fingerprints, the fee shall be determined according to the severity of the circumstances and the amount of materials used, ranging from 300 yuan to 5,000 yuan. For private requests to identify fingerprints, the fee shall be determined according to the type of situation, ranging from 300 yuan to 3,000 yuan. The fee for appraising handwriting is limited to private lawsuits and is currently set from 2,300 yuan to 10,000 yuan, depending on the subject of the lawsuit, and is increased or decreased according to the complexity of the work. Incidental expenses are calculated separately. All government agencies, courts, and legal entities may request the Identification Section of the bureau to appraise on behalf of their parties. As for public funds and other expenses, they shall be paid with a receipt from the bureau. For weapons appraisal, a checkup fee of 30 yuan shall be collected annually for each licensed firearm and paid with a receipt from the bureau.</p>

<p>The Shenbao Cup Basketball Game has reached a crucial stage in Group A. The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory team has won seven games out of seven. Tonight is the last second game against Dahua. If they can pass this level, they will play against Zhongbei in the championship final. Dahua is composed of new and old famous players, but unfortunately, they are inferior to others. They had great ambitions beforehand, but the model of the old generals is still there. It can be seen from the battle against Zhongbei that the victory or defeat of tonight's battle is insignificant to Dahua, but for the sake of reputation, they will inevitably do their best to compete. The battle is related to the Hualian championship, and the great battle is even more needless to say. Another Group A game, Huaying vs. Tongren, is also related to the ranking. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Qingxie vs. Fei Dui (B3) 6:30 PM, Huaying vs. Tongren (A) 7:15 PM, Hualian vs. Dahua (A) 8:15 PM.</p>

<p>Nearly three years have passed swiftly since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. We are now in the decisive phase.
