<h3>日航空部隊奇襲　塞班迭尼安兩島　擊毀敵大型機二十架以上</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日下午六時發表：日航空部隊七　未明攻擊塞班島及迭尼安島之敵機塲，於塞班鳥方面，對正在集合中之敵大型機加以轟炸及掃射，將其中二十架以上擊毀或擊燬，同時並炸毀機場施設數處，使之起火。於迭尼安島方面，全體均命中敵機場，以有雲故戰果未能確認，是役日機一架未歸還基地。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　敵美爲牽制菲律賓作戰，並破壞日軍戰力之源泉，屢思對日本本土實行戰略轟炸，最近絡續於已完成之馬利納方面基地，集結長距離之Ｂ29型轟炸機，對此，日軍航空隊曾於十一月三日予以先發制人之打擊。七日黎明，日軍航空隊再長驅對塞班，迭尼安敵機場敢行猛攻，即日軍航空隊於七日黎明奇襲塞班，迭尼安二島，當將正集聚於塞班鳥南端阿斯特機場之B29型機的四十架包圍，投下必中之炸彈，並以超低空飛行，反覆予以掃射，使Ｂ29型機二十架以上炸毀或起火，並炸毀機場設施或起火，機場全部化爲火海，同時，日軍一隊並對塞班鳥北端飛機場加以攻擊，予以莫大打擊。迭尼安攻擊部隊，則於暗雲內潛入敵機場上空，對其所有設施痛加轟炸，因暗雲關係，未得確認戰果。又超低空敢死攻擊之部隊，因敵探照燈亂射，雖未得認淸戰果，但確悉對迭尼安鳥已予以與塞班島同樣之大打擊。當此次日軍攻擊時，曾發現B29型機四十架集結於塞班鳥，由此可判斷敵正於塞班鳥準備大量空軍，企圖進擊日本土，日軍此次攻擊，實可謂已制敵之先機。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地七日中央社電　日航空部隊六日空襲摩羅泰島敵機　，炸毀敵機二十架以上，並有敵航空基地數處中彈起火，機場南北皆陷於火燃中。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰戰鬥激烈日精銳部隊創敵　空軍亦猛炸敵機塲船團</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電日神風攻擊隊十月廿五日以來，繼續猛攻菲律賓鄰近海面之敵機動部隊及運輸船團，至十一月五日，計擊沉或擊傷敵艦船達二十六艘，據判明擊沉敵空母四艘，運輸船一艘，巡洋艦二艘，擊傷敵空母七艘，戰艦及巡艦各三艘，巡艦或驅逐艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，運輸船一艘，艦型不明者三艘。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　敵方前曾大爲宣傳菲律賓雷伊泰島登陸作戰，惟該方面作戰完全失敗，後復力謀作種種掩飾，於是雷伊泰島日軍陸上部隊之士氣，乃因之益感興奮，堅持各要衝，予敵重創。同時，塔克羅班方面日軍亦死守陣地，不顧敵軍之任何執拗攻擊，如本月四日，敵步兵曾大舉來攻，惟卒因重創而被擊退。哈洛及卡里加拉等地日軍，亦着着增大，與敵軍展開猛烈之戰鬥，予以重創後，卒將敵攻擊企圖完全粉碎。此外，據守卡塔蒙高地（位於塔克羅班與塔拉克之間）之日軍精銳部隊，雖遭敵包圍，然仍能死守陣地，挺身突入敵隨，使敵不寒而慄。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫七日中央社電　日陸眾機隊，曾於四日夜間猛炸雷伊泰灣內敵運輸船團，使其大型及中型運輸船各一艘起火，並炸沉敵小型運輸船二艘。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　日空軍曾於五日夜急襲塔克羅班機塲，炸毀敵機二十餘架，焚毀敵大型機三架。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地六日中央社電　日機隊曾於二日夜轟炸雷伊泰灣方面之敵運輸船團，毀敵運輸船團二艘，使塔克羅班機塲六處起火，三日薄暮，轟炸塔拉克灑之敵運輸船，炸毀運輸船一艘，更於三日夜間在斯黎高水道附近，轟炸敵魚雷艇羣，炸毀其中二艘。又於四日午刻轟炸塔克羅班機塲及附近海上之運輸船團，使機塲四處起火，焚毀運輸船一艘，更於五日黎明，急襲摩羅泰島敵機塲，冒敵方地上防空砲火，予以重創，計機塲數處起火，焚燬停放之小型機數架，日機安返基地。</p>
<h3>菲島各地　空襲頻繁</h3>
<p>日軍菲島基地七日中央社電　敵艦載機近以呂宋島爲中心，頻襲各地，日艦隊於馬尼刺灣與敵機交戰，擊落其一架。</p>
<p>菲島基地七日中央社電　呂宋島東方海面之敵機動部隊，以艦載機二百架襲馬尼刺，以艦上機約一百五十架襲克拉克，非爾特。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　敵於五日上午六時四十分至下午四時，以戰鬥轟炸聯合艦上機累計二百〇四架，來襲馬尼刺地區，同時於上午七時五十分至下午三時，又以戰鬥轟炸聯合之艦上機累計八十五架來襲克拉克，但經日空軍及陸上砲火分別在以上兩地區邀擊後，來襲兩地區之敵機，即共被擊落約四十架，被擊毀三架。</p>
<p>菲島基地七日中央社電　六日侵晨，宿霧鳥有敵。B24型機P34型機累計的九十一架來襲。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　六日上午九時至十二時間，有敵B24，Ｐ25，P38,P51等型，累計百架來襲峇哥律地區，日航空部隊當予激擊，展開激烈空戰，擊落敵P38型</p>
<p>琉黃等島擊落敵機　中部太平洋日軍基地七日中央社電五日下午，小笠原羣島琉黃鳥有敵Ｂ29型機約四十架來襲，被日軍擊落其一架。又中部太平洋各方面之敵機來襲狀况如次：（一）六日晨母島有B24型機十架來襲，（二）六日上午，父鳥有B24型機數架來襲，（三）四日晨雅浦島有敵機數架來襲，（四）五日晨瓦塞島有敵小型機二十架來襲。西南太平洋日軍基地七日中央社電五日白盡，哈爾馬黑拉島北方，有敵中型機二十餘架來襲，被日軍擊落二十二架，六日白畫，又有B25型節二十餘架來襲，被日軍擊落其二架，又里母鳥北部，六日白突有B25型機約十架來襲。</p>
<p>敵機偵查日本關東　東京七日中央社電　馬利亞納方面敵航空基地之B29型機，二時許侵入日本關束地方，約一小時後即向南遁去，敵機此次侵入之目的，似仍爲偵察。北千鳥日軍某基地七日中央社電敵B25型機四架，B24型機二架，前後三次來襲北千島，日戰鬥機隊當予邀擊，擊毀其B25型機二架，B24型機一架，敵機旋遁走，日方則無損失。</p>
<h3>印東部國境　將展開大戰　鮑斯主席談話</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯，六日會見記者團，闡明此次訪日目的，第一爲與日首相及新內閣各大臣會見，第二爲訪問日本政府及軍代表，協議關於將來政治、軍事相互協力的各種問題，推進我人的共同戰爭。印度緬甸國境及印度內部之軍事行動，吾人已有經騐，現採取攻勢，到處紮敗敵軍。最近由於軍事與氣候關係，我方始有一部自動後退，然由於此次經騐，更深信最後勝利必屬於我，現在吾人正準備慰勞之攻勢，印度作戰中，大激戰將於印度東部國境及其附近展開</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>增強中日合作</h3>
<p>中日同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言於十月三十日和十一月六日巳各滿一周年，正値頑敵孤注一擲，盟軍在菲島海面獲得勝利之秋，我們在此重要關頭中迎渡這二個紀念日，深覺中日兩國有益加緊密合作的必要。惟有中日兩國更高度合作之下，纔可使對渝共的大陸戰爭和　英美的海空戰爭，獲致更大的戰果。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭以來，中日兩國緊密合作，共同擊潰敵人，戰續昭然。但爲確保勝利，在目前更需要我們作更大的致力，以期兩國合作，益臻完美無疵。</p>
<p>第一是加強互信。英美渝現方運用種種宣　謀略，冀副破壞我們的合作，因此更需要我們澈底精誠互信，俾以事實來粉碎離間。在中國方面，不僅必須完全相信日本解放東亞的誠意，而且又須信任日本，最後必能驅滅英美的力量，絕不應爲了敵方歪曲宣傅或無稽謠言而動搖和迷惑。至於日本方面，則不僅要絕對相信國民政府，而且要信任中國人民的各種力量，一方面給與國府以較大的權力，一方面給與中國人民以較多的便利，庶幾羣策靈力，合作無間。</p>
<p>第二是正確發揮中國的力量。中國物力人力雄厚，在大東亞戰爭中所佔地位的重要，是毋庸贅言的。但要發揮中國雄厚的力量，必須具體地把握中國的實際環境。所有中日兩國有關發揮中國物力人力的施策，應該適合中國實情。否則雙方的損失一定很大。譬如現今所施行的統制經濟，有些地方由於太斷然之故，以致影響生產，使中國的物力不能有如理想的盡量發揮出來，實非上策。上述國民政府，信任中國人民，讓中國人能不太受拘束的行事，也正是發揮中國力量的必要條件。而發揮中國力量以供獻於大束亞戰爭，爭取東亞民族的解放，便是申日合作的基本目標。</p>
<p>第三長安定中國民生，一切力量藏於民，人民如果連最低限度的生活也無法安定，便很難使他們貢獻巨大的力量出來。本月四日國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏由日返任後在滬發表談話時也說：「…故使中國資源戰力化，尤其對中國民生安定爲主要重點：」，又說：「…中國資源戰力化及建設新中國兩事，仍以安定民生爲前提：」（見五日本報）。但無可否認的，目前中國的民生問題，實已到了極其嚴重的階段。所以如何設法安定中國民生，也是鞏固中日合作的基礎事情之一。</p>
<p>要之，在此緊急的局面中，中日兩國必須增强合作，應在精誠互助之下，讓中國的力量，多多發揮出來，以爭取戰爭的勝利。</p>
<h3>緬甸日空軍　猛襲巴列爾　歸途並與敵機演空戰</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫日軍某基地七日中央社電　緬甸方面日部隊，於五日拂斃空襲巴列爾，節節排除敵噴火式飛機之抵抗，擊落其中一架後，即突入巴列爾南總機塲，當地以猛炸，卒使停放地上之敵機一架起火焚燒，該機型不明，並於歸途戴擊在達姆機塲之敵大小型約三十架，卒使其中B25型機一架起火焚燒，此外並予其他設施以相富損害，是役日機亦有一架未飛還。</p>
<h3>小倉今日接見　首都記者團</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，於本年七月間返國養疴，業於日前由日返京。茲悉小倉氏定於八日下午四時在顧問官邸，接見首都中國記者團，屆時國府今後之經濟施策，將有重大之計劃發表。</p>
<h3>代理海長凌霄即將返國視事</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　自海軍部長任援道榮轉蘇省長後所遣部長一職，業經中政會議決議由我駐日大使館海軍武官凌霄氏代理。茲聞凌氏奉命，後刻正整理行裝，於短期內返國到部視事。</p>
<h3>桂省日軍精銳　向柳州猛進中　北路要衝象縣被佔領</h3>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　據華南前綫日軍基地訊：向柳江左岸地區挺進之日軍精銳部隊，六日下午二時佔領柳州東南四十公里之柳州北路要衝象縣，繼之並渡河猛追渝軍迫近柳州。</p>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍委會六日發表戰况謂，日軍現自柳桂公路及平樂兩方面向柳州猛進中。其言如决，自永福沿柳桂公路南下之日軍，五日到達永福西南三十公里之利定，刻正與渝軍展開激戰中。此外自平樂荔浦方面向柳州進攻中之別動部隊，現已佔領荔浦西南三十公里之修仁，目下正於該地區附近展開激戰。</p>
<p>桂林七日中央社電　桂林日軍包圍綱，繼續向渝軍外廓陳地縮小，日軍一部五日傍晚於江東村（桂林市西北約六六里）家田村及中間地帶，痛擊渝軍，並作奇襲，在洞窟內捕獲渝軍營長以次渝兵多各，鹵獲機槍兵器彈藥甚多云。</p>
<p>廣西前綫基地七日中央社電　日有力部隊呼應進攻桂林作戰。於十月三十日夜抵達桂江東岸柳家村附近，一氣渡過桂江，繼續痛擊據守該地之渝軍。十一月一日夜佔領桂林南方六公里之第二機塲（南部機塲）繼之佔取桂林東南十八公里第三機塲（東南機塲）另一部日軍切斷湘桂公路西進，猛攻桂林空軍主要基地之第一機塲（西南機塲）掃除渝軍之反擊，四日夜桂林之空中要塞已全吿崩潰云。</p>

<h3>日新銳潛水艦隊　威脅敵海上補給　美破員艦船施應急修理</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日潛水艦隊，自大東亞戰爭勃發之初，即長驅進攻美國太平洋沿岸，其後更於太平洋，印度洋，績行神出鬼沒之活躍，故日潛水仍在美太平洋沿岸繼續活躍之事實，自無疑問。十月三日於哈爾馬黑拉東方海面，沉毀敵空母二艘，又於菲律賓海面海戰之際，擊沉敵空母及艦船五艘，十一月三日於雷伊泰東方海面擊沉敵愛賽克斯型空母一艘。日潛水艦隊之戰果，更與日俱增，於敵美太平洋海岸擊沉輸送船數艘。太平洋戰局之歸國，即依次轉入海上補給戰，美之弱點已逐漸增大，今日潛水艦之活躍，將使期補給愈趨困難，故敵美之威脅雖大，而日軍新銳潛水艦之爲例，必能衝破敵軍所有之警戒。</p>

<h3>安徽省政近狀</h3>
<p>— 若澄</p>
<p>——羅省長訪問記</p>
<p>安徽省的地位，在和平區內也是一個很重要的省份，在交通上講，有津浦鐵路淮南鐵路江南鐵路。在經濟上講，有蕪湖米，淮南煤。自從羅君强先生出任省長以來，據各方面的口碑，對於省政推進，比較上確有一審新耳目的精神。聽說羅省長最近日皖來滬公幹，木報爲明瞭安徽省政的近况，派遣記者作了一次動間，承蒙羅省長親自延見，並且指示了很多關於安徽省政的概况。</p>
<p>訪問以前的想像</p>
<p>記者以前並未見過羅氏，可是在未訪問羅氏之前，腦海中似乎已經有了一個想像的輪廓，因爲在各方面的傳聞中，知道羅氏具有敢作敢爲，快幹實幹的靑年政治家進一步的精神，在南京國民政府的高級官吏中是比較幹練的一員，當故司法界甞宿張累搏先生，繼任羅氏出長司法行政部以後，曾公開的贊美羅氏任內很有幾件切切實實的政績。我們認爲服官爲政，第一是肯做事，做得好不好，有沒有政績倒是第二問題，因爲這裏牽涉到很多的環境問題。肯做事而環境好，當然有美滿的成績，肯做事而環境不好，至少也有一半成績，同時，可以從而得到所以做不好的經騐。惟有額預敷衍不肯做事，縱然環境很好，也是根本沒有做好的可能，當然談不到成績了。因爲我先知道羅先生是肯做事的，等到見面談話以後，更證實了我的想像，羅先生是具有坦白的胸懷，熱烈的情緒，尤其是脚踏實地的肯做事的精神。以下所記的都是羅氏談話的要點。</p>
<p>治安的一斑</p>
<p>安徽省政府目前管轄的有三十二個單位，就是三十個縣，兩個特別區。特別區公署等於縣政府。管轄地區約爲安徽省全境的一半。其餘的一半，不外是新四軍以及重慶方面的勞力。</p>
<p>至於新四軍的勢力，一不必否認的有其存在的環境，他們是善於利用「邊區」的活動，譬如在毘連的幾縣之間，樹立一個邊區或設辦事處，或設某等縣的邊區政府。我們的省政府或是縣政府，是守住省或縣的界限，各自盡力於本身界限以內的事，而他們就利用這一點，分割幾縣的一角，樹立邊區，竄來竄走去在邊區活動，逐漸擴張其勢力範圍。所以，新四軍的數量很難作計的，目前他們的軍力，　也許在皖省府的軍力之上。不過，並不集中而是分數的。</p>
<p>目前皖省的保安隊及警察，全部有近三萬人。警察的任務實與保安隊的維護治安相同，有相當的作戰力，此外國府的正規軍約　三師，由綏靖主任統轄，並不歸省長指揮的。我們的這些軍力，確保管轄範圍內大多數地方的安居，固然不敢誇說，可是，幾個較大的城市如蚌埠蕪湖安慶等地是沒有問題的。</p>
<p>不幸的就是新四軍所據的邊區，以及其他的鄉僻之處，重慶方面的所謂中救軍挺進軍等類似軍隊的組織，有的雖與渝方有關，有的根本無關的土著之衆，政治上旣沒有主張，行動上尤不守秩序，在這一帶的老百姓的遭遇就最痛苦了。</p>
<p>整理稅收的成效</p>
<p>當本人到任之初，省府經費收人每月僅二百餘萬元，這個數目根本不能維持一個衙門，什麼政治效率，什麼廉潔政治當然談不到。現在經過整理稅收以後，半年預算已達七萬五千萬元，每月經費一萬二千萬餘元，與本人到任時比較，經費增加了六十倍。這個預算裏包括縣行政費及警保經費，及一部分軍費，因爲綏靖公署的軍費，四成由省府擔任的。</p>
<p>整理稅收原是增加經費的泉源，徼稅的機構人事及辦法改良以後，稅收增加至四十倍。但整稅並非增稅。最近自十月一日復變更徵稅制度，稅收更見起色，迄今收入又增加十倍，而稅率仍照舊時規定，於此足蹬過去稅收的大病，是舞弊囂張，舞弊減少，稅收自然增加。</p>
<p>稅收人員特別注重品質與待遇，各地稽征主任，均登報公開錄用專家，四分之三是大學畢業生，其中三分之二在金融界服務多年，且自上海進去的頗多，待遇則特別提高，希望不舞弊，從十月一日試辦以來，已經見到相當成績了。</p>
<p>公務人員的待遇</p>
<p>公務人員的待遇提高，是本人一貫主張，到任以後，第一步做到與中央同，現在一般公務員待遇，比較南京各機關爲高，高級的主管官員，如縣長廳長等，特別提高。同時，特別注意稅收人員及警務人員，因爲這輩人與民衆接觸的機會最多，最容易有舞弊索賄的可能，譬如蚱埠等較大城市，稅收與警務人員待遇較前增加至五十倍。自七月份以來，省府對於屬員的配給米，無論如何不使脫期。</p>
<p>地方行政的困難</p>
<p>目前感覺地方行政的一困難約有兩點：第一，一切設施，往往不能如省府意旨去做而受旁的環境的影響。第二，現政洽的組織，以及從政分子，就全般而論，實在不足以應付當前時局。換句話說，當前時局是非常時局，必須快幹與廉正，現在的從政分子怎能勝任呢？講到廉潔，常然先安定生活，本人吃飽穿暖還不够，還須一家人的吃飽穿暖。政府雖有此心，不能絕對做到，就安徽省而論，也祇能做到百分之五十而已。</p>
<p>其次，從任何一方面看，中國的各制勢力，無非在夾縫中混而已。盟邦日本對敵英美戰爭的節節勝利，絕非僥倖，數十年的準備，數十年的自强不息，有以致之。和平運動幾年以來，在艱難困苦中奮鬥，今後更期擺脫夾縫中混，自須更大的努力，更艱苦奮鬥呢！</p>

        <h1>1944.11.08</h1>
<h3>Surprise Attack by Japanese Air Force: Saipan and Tinian Islands; Over 20 Enemy Large Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 7th: Japanese air units attacked enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Islands in the early hours of the 7th. In the Saipan area, they bombed and strafed enemy large aircraft that were assembling, destroying or damaging more than twenty of them. At the same time, they bombed and set fire to several airfield facilities. In the Tinian Island area, all attacks hit the enemy airfield, but the results could not be confirmed due to cloud cover. One Japanese aircraft did not return to base in this operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to check the Philippine operations and destroy the source of Japanese military strength, the enemy Americans have repeatedly considered strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland. Recently, they have been continuously assembling long-range B-29 bombers at the newly completed bases in the Mariana Islands. In response, the Japanese air force launched a preemptive strike on November 3rd. At dawn on the 7th, the Japanese air force again made a long-range attack on the enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian, bravely launching a fierce assault. The Japanese air force's surprise attack on Saipan and Tinian Islands at dawn on the 7th surrounded forty B-29 aircraft that were gathering at Aslito Airfield in southern Saipan, dropping bombs with pinpoint accuracy and strafing them repeatedly at extremely low altitude, destroying or setting fire to more than twenty B-29 aircraft and destroying or setting fire to airfield facilities. The entire airfield was turned into a sea of fire. At the same time, a Japanese unit attacked the airfield at the northern end of Saipan, inflicting great damage. The Tinian attack force infiltrated the enemy airfield airspace under cover of dark clouds and heavily bombed all its facilities, but the results could not be confirmed due to the dark clouds. The suicide attack unit at extremely low altitude, although unable to clearly ascertain the results due to the enemy's chaotic searchlight fire, was certain that Tinian Island had been dealt the same heavy blow as Saipan Island. During this Japanese attack, forty B-29 aircraft were found assembled on Saipan, which indicates that the enemy is preparing a large air force on Saipan, attempting to attack the Japanese mainland. The Japanese attack can be said to have preempted the enemy's plans.</p>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units bombed enemy aircraft on Morotai Island on the 6th, destroying more than twenty enemy aircraft. Several enemy air bases were hit and caught fire, with both the north and south of the airfield engulfed in flames.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle on Leyte; Elite Japanese Troops Inflict Damage; Air Force also Heavily Bombs Enemy Airfields and Convoys</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since October 25th, the Japanese Kamikaze attack force has continued to fiercely attack enemy mobile units and transport convoys in the waters near the Philippines. Up to November 5th, a total of 26 enemy ships have been sunk or damaged. It has been determined that four enemy aircraft carriers, one transport ship, and two cruisers have been sunk. Seven enemy aircraft carriers, three battleships and cruisers each, one cruiser or destroyer, one destroyer, one transport ship, and three ships of unknown type have been damaged.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy previously publicized the landing operation on Leyte Island in the Philippines, but the operation completely failed. Afterwards, they tried to cover up the failure in various ways. As a result, the morale of the Japanese land forces on Leyte Island was boosted, and they defended key points, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese army in Tacloban also tenaciously defended their positions, regardless of any stubborn attacks by the enemy. For example, on the 4th of this month, the enemy infantry launched a large-scale attack, but were ultimately repulsed with heavy losses. The Japanese forces in Haro and Carigara also intensified their attacks, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy and inflicting heavy damage, completely thwarting the enemy's attack attempts. In addition, the elite Japanese troops defending Catmon Hill (located between Tacloban and Talak) were surrounded by the enemy, but they were still able to tenaciously defend their positions, bravely breaking into the enemy ranks, making the enemy tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese army air units heavily bombed enemy transport convoys in Leyte Gulf on the night of the 4th, setting fire to one large and one medium-sized transport ship each, and sinking two small enemy transport ships.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese air force launched a surprise attack on Tacloban Airfield on the night of the 5th, destroying more than twenty enemy aircraft and burning three large enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units bombed enemy transport convoys in Leyte Gulf on the night of the 2nd, destroying two enemy transport ships and setting fire to six places at Tacloban Airfield. At dusk on the 3rd, they bombed enemy transport ships off Talak, destroying one transport ship. Furthermore, on the night of the 3rd, they bombed enemy torpedo boat groups near the Surigao Strait, destroying two of them. Also, at noon on the 4th, they bombed Tacloban Airfield and transport convoys in the nearby sea, setting fire to four places at the airfield and burning one transport ship. Furthermore, at dawn on the 5th, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on Morotai Island, braving the enemy's ground anti-aircraft fire and inflicting heavy damage. Several places at the airfield caught fire, and several small aircraft parked there were burned. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Frequent Air Raids Throughout the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Philippine Island Base, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy carrier-based aircraft have been frequently attacking various locations, mainly centered on Luzon Island. The Japanese fleet engaged enemy aircraft in Manila Bay, shooting down one of them.</p>
<p>Philippine Island Base, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy mobile units in the waters east of Luzon Island attacked Manila with 200 carrier-based aircraft and Clark Field with approximately 150 carrier-based aircraft.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – From 6:40 AM to 4:00 PM on the 5th, a total of 204 enemy fighter-bomber carrier-based aircraft attacked the Manila area. At the same time, from 7:50 AM to 3:00 PM, a total of 85 fighter-bomber carrier-based aircraft attacked Clark Field. However, after being intercepted by the Japanese air force and ground artillery in the above two areas, approximately forty enemy aircraft attacking the two areas were shot down, and three were destroyed.</p>
<p>Philippine Island Base, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – At dawn on the 6th, Cebu Island was attacked by a total of 91 enemy B-24 and P-38 aircraft.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 6th, approximately one hundred enemy B-24, P-35, P-38, and P-51 aircraft attacked the Bakolod area. The Japanese air force fiercely intercepted them, engaging in fierce air combat and shooting down enemy P-38 aircraft.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have each reached their first anniversary on October 30th and November 6th respectively. It is during the autumn when the stubborn enemy is making a last-ditch effort and the allied forces have gained a victory in the Philippine Sea, that we welcome these two anniversaries at this important juncture. We deeply feel the need for closer cooperation between China and Japan. Only with greater cooperation between China and Japan can we achieve greater results in the continental war against the Chongqing communists and the Anglo-American naval and air war.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan have cooperated closely and jointly defeated the enemy, and the record is clear. However, in order to ensure victory, we need to make even greater efforts at present to make the cooperation between the two countries more perfect and flawless.</p>
<p>The first is to strengthen mutual trust. The Anglo-American-Chongqing faction is currently using various propaganda schemes, hoping to undermine our cooperation. Therefore, we need to thoroughly and sincerely trust each other, so as to use facts to shatter the alienation. On the Chinese side, it is not only necessary to fully believe in Japan's sincerity in liberating East Asia, but also to trust that Japan will eventually be able to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States, and should never be shaken or confused by the enemy's distorted propaganda or unfounded rumors. As for the Japanese side, it is not only necessary to absolutely believe in the National Government, but also to trust the various forces of the Chinese people. On the one hand, it should give the National Government greater power, and on the other hand, it should give the Chinese people more convenience, so that everyone can work together seamlessly.</p>
<p>The second is to correctly exert the power of China. China's material and human resources are abundant, and its importance in the Greater East Asia War is self-evident. However, to exert China's abundant power, it is necessary to specifically grasp China's actual environment. All policies of China and Japan related to exerting China's material and human resources should be in accordance with China's actual situation. Otherwise, the losses on both sides will definitely be great. For example, the current controlled economy, in some places, due to being too decisive, affects production, making China's material resources unable to be fully exerted as ideally, which is not the best policy. The above-mentioned National Government, trusting the Chinese people, and allowing the Chinese people to act without too many restrictions, is also a necessary condition for exerting China's power. And exerting China's power to contribute to the Greater East Asia War and strive for the liberation of the East Asian people is the basic goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>The third is to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people. All strength lies in the people. If the people cannot even stabilize their minimum standard of living, it is difficult to make them contribute great strength. Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, also said in a speech in Shanghai after returning from Japan on the 4th of this month: "...Therefore, making China's resources a combat power, especially stabilizing the livelihood of the Chinese people, is the main focus:" and also said: "...The two things of making China's resources a combat power and building a new China still take stabilizing the livelihood of the people as a prerequisite:" (See the 5th Japanese newspaper). But undeniably, the current livelihood problem in China has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, how to find a way to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people is also one of the basic things to consolidate Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>In short, in this urgent situation, China and Japan must strengthen cooperation. Under sincere mutual assistance, let the power of China be fully exerted, so as to strive for the victory of the war.</p>

<h3>Japanese New Submarine Fleet Threatens Enemy Sea Supply; U.S. Damage Repair Ships Carry Out Emergency Repairs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese submarine fleet has launched a long-range attack on the Pacific coast of the United States, and then continued its elusive activities in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Therefore, there is no doubt that Japanese submarines are still active off the U.S. Pacific coast. On October 3rd, two enemy aircraft carriers were sunk in the waters east of Halmahera, and five enemy aircraft carriers and ships were sunk during the naval battle in the Philippine Sea. On November 3rd, one enemy Essex-class aircraft carrier was sunk in the waters east of Leyte. The achievements of the Japanese submarine fleet are increasing, and several transport ships have been sunk off the enemy U.S. Pacific coast. The fate of the Pacific war situation will gradually turn into a sea supply war, and the weaknesses of the United States have gradually increased. Today, the activities of submarines will make its supply more and more difficult. Therefore, although the threat of the enemy United States is great, the examples of the Japanese new submarine fleet will be able to break through all the enemy's vigilance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The U.S. mobile unit is carrying out emergency repairs on the damaged and surviving fleets, so that they will reappear in the waters east of the Philippines. However, the enemy forces landing on Leyte Island are subjected to relentless attacks day and night by the Japanese Navy Air Force. Its connections with the sweeping forces are almost completely cut off. Land offensives have also failed to succeed. Three weeks have passed since the landing, and they have only fought isolated and helpless battles. Therefore, the enemy mobile unit does not hesitate to spend a long time to carry out only emergency repairs on the surviving fleet, and must urgently reinforce Leyte again. Since October 30th, not a single enemy aircraft has been seen in the entire city of the Philippines. Enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Manila and Clark areas on the 5th, and the Japanese superior air units, waiting for the opportunity to move, suddenly intercepted them, annihilating more than ten of them and sinking three enemy aircraft carriers.</p>

<h3>Strict Crackdown on Resale of Rationed Cigarettes on the Black Market: Hope Citizens Will Report Illegal Businesses</h3>

Most of these residents leaving Shanghai are traveling by water on ships because it is convenient to carry luggage. On the direct Shanghai-Suzhou express ships, most of the passengers feel that life in Shanghai is difficult, and the personal luggage of each passenger often exceeds ten pieces, indicating that the burden of living in this city has reached a serious stage for residents, so they are leaving for their hometowns. In the inland areas around Suzhou and Changzhou, not only are prices lower, but the prices of basic food are several times lower than in Shanghai. The guilds of the banking and financial industries in this city will convene meetings in the coming days to discuss and decide on issues such as members' capital increases and improved business procedures to standardize operations.</p>

Yu Binqi was elected as chairman and Hu Jiankun as secretary. Several important cases were resolved: (1) Board member Xu Duo passed away due to illness. His vacancy was filled by Liang Jintang. (2) Mr. Xu Duo spared no effort in promoting ping pong, but his family is now in poverty. He left behind a widow and three children. It was decided that the association would not only send condolences of 3,000 yuan, but also undertake the education expenses of one of his three children up to high school. (3) The Shanghai Ping Pong Tournament has concluded. The 22 teams that participated and did not forfeit once, including the Postal Workers and Jingwu teams, can collect their security deposits from Yu Binqi at Ping An Company, No. 108 Jiangning Road, starting today with their receipts.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Anhui Provincial Government</h3>
<p>By Ruocheng</p>
<p>-- Interview with Provincial Governor Luo</p>
<p>Anhui Province is also a very important province in the peace zone. In terms of transportation, it has the Jinpu Railway, the Huainan Railway, and the Jiangnan Railway. In terms of economy, it has Wuhu rice and Huainan coal. Since Mr. Luo Junqiang took office as governor, according to word of mouth from various sources, he has indeed brought a refreshing spirit to the promotion of provincial administration. It is said that Governor Luo recently came to Shanghai on official business from Anhui. This newspaper, in order to understand the recent situation of Anhui provincial administration, sent a reporter to conduct an interview. We are grateful to Governor Luo for personally receiving us and providing much information about the overview of Anhui provincial administration.</p>
<p>Imagination Before the Interview</p>
<p>The reporter had not met Mr. Luo before, but before interviewing Mr. Luo, there seemed to be a contour of imagination in my mind, because from various rumors, I knew that Mr. Luo has the spirit of a young politician who dares to act and get things done quickly. He is a relatively capable member among the senior officials of the Nanjing National Government. The late Justice Zhang Leibo, who succeeded Mr. Luo as head of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, once publicly praised Mr. Luo for having several very solid achievements during his tenure. We believe that the first thing in serving as an official is to be willing to work. Whether it is done well or not, and whether there are achievements or not, is a secondary issue, because many environmental problems are involved. If you are willing to work and the environment is good, of course you will have satisfactory results. If you are willing to work and the environment is not good, you will at least have half the results. At the same time, you can learn from the experience of why you didn't do well. Only those who are perfunctory and unwilling to work, even if the environment is very good, have no possibility of doing well at all, and of course there is no possibility of talking about achievements. Because I first knew that Mr. Luo was willing to work, and after meeting and talking with him, it confirmed my imagination even more. Mr. Luo has an honest mind, enthusiastic emotions, and especially the spirit of being down-to-earth and willing to work. The following are the main points of Mr. Luo's speech.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Public Security</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government currently manages thirty-two units, which are thirty counties and two special districts. The special district office is equivalent to the county government. The area under its jurisdiction is about half of the entire Anhui Province. The other half is nothing more than the New Fourth Army and the labor force from Chongqing.</p>
<p>As for the strength of the New Fourth Army, it cannot be denied that it has an environment for its existence. They are good at using "border areas" for activities. For example, between several adjacent counties, they establish a border area or set up an office, or set up a border area government of a certain county. Our provincial government or county government guards the boundaries of the province or county and does its best within its own boundaries, while they use this point to divide a corner of several counties, establish a border area, and move back and forth to carry out activities in the border area, gradually expanding their sphere of influence. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate the number of the New Fourth Army. Currently, their military strength may be above the military strength of the Anhui provincial government. However, it is not concentrated but fragmented.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 30,000 security teams and police in Anhui Province. The task of the police is the same as that of the security team in maintaining public security, and they have considerable combat power. In addition, there are about three divisions of the National Government's regular army, which are under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Director and are not under the command of the provincial governor. Our military strength ensures the peaceful life of most places within the jurisdiction. We certainly dare not boast, but there is no problem in several larger cities such as Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the border areas occupied by the New Fourth Army, and in other remote places, the so-called Central Relief Army and Advance Army and other similar military organizations from Chongqing, some are related to Chongqing, and some are indigenous people who are not related at all. They have no political views and do not abide by order in their actions. The people in this area suffer the most.</p>
<p>The Effectiveness of Reorganizing Tax Revenue</p>
<p>When I first took office, the provincial government's financial revenue was only more than 2 million yuan per month. This amount could not maintain a government office at all. Political efficiency and clean governance were of course out of the question. Now, after reorganizing tax revenue, the six-month budget has reached 750 million yuan, and the monthly expenditure is more than 120 million yuan, which is sixty times more than when I took office. This budget includes county administrative expenses, police and security expenses, and part of military expenses, because the provincial government is responsible for 40% of the Pacification Commissioner's military expenses.</p>
<p>Reorganizing tax revenue was originally the source of increasing revenue. After the agency personnel and methods of collecting taxes were improved, tax revenue increased forty times. However, reorganizing taxes is not increasing taxes. Recently, since October 1, the tax system has been changed again, and tax revenue has improved even more. To date, revenue has increased tenfold, and the tax rate is still the same as before. This proves that the biggest problem with past tax revenue was rampant corruption. When corruption is reduced, tax revenue naturally increases.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to the quality and treatment of tax personnel. The directors of tax collection in various places are publicly recruiting experts in newspapers. Three-quarters are university graduates, two-thirds of whom have served in the financial industry for many years, and many have come from Shanghai. They are given special high salaries in the hope that they will not be corrupt. Since the trial operation began on October 1, considerable results have been seen.</p>
<p>The Treatment of Civil Servants</p>
<p>Improving the treatment of civil servants is my consistent proposition. After taking office, the first step was to make it the same as the central government. Now, the treatment of general civil servants is higher than that of various agencies in Nanjing. Senior management officials, such as county magistrates and department heads, are given special increases. At the same time, special attention is paid to tax personnel and police personnel, because these people have the most opportunities to contact the public and are most likely to be corrupt and solicit bribes. For example, in larger cities such as Zhazhao, the treatment of tax and police personnel has increased up to fifty times compared to before. Since July, the provincial government has ensured that the ration rice for its subordinates is not delayed no matter what.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Local Administration</p>
<p>There are currently about two difficulties in feeling local administration: First, all facilities often cannot be done according to the intentions of the provincial government and are affected by other environments. Second, the current political organization and the politicians are, on the whole, really not enough to cope with the current situation. In other words, the current situation is a very extraordinary situation, and quick action and integrity are required. How can the current politicians be competent? When it comes to integrity, of course, we must first stabilize our lives. It is not enough for me to be well-fed and well-clothed. I also need my family to be well-fed and well-clothed. Although the government has this intention, it cannot do it absolutely. As far as Anhui Province is concerned, it can only do about 50%.</p>
<p>Secondly, from any perspective, the various forces in China are nothing more than mixing in the cracks. The successive victories of the allied Japanese against the enemy Anglo-American war were by no means a fluke. Decades of preparation and decades of self-improvement led to this. The peace movement has been struggling in difficulties for several years. In the future, we hope to get rid of mixing in the cracks, and we must make greater efforts and struggle more arduously!</p>
