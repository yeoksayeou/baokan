<h3>亟須重視米糧問題</h3>
<p>自從八九兩月之間，得到盟邦的協助，恢復戶口米配給，并未脫期減量，同時，實施十石以下米自由搬運辦法以後，米價得以穩定一時，市民莫不額手欣幸。　　十月份以後的戶口米配給，聽說米統會當局屢次表示極有把握。這是米統會改組以後第一椿好消息。我們也相信米統會對於十月以後的配給米，在八九兩月的長時期中，已有很好的佈置，已有充分的準備，決不會失信於市民了。不過，在此時期，忽將十石以下米搬運辦法廢止，而改爲八公斤以內始得自由搬運。這種變更辦法的意義，據說經此限制以後，使內地的米不易來滬，內地米價可以降低，因此，可以便利各地區低價收買。　　然而，我們的見解，與此不同。因爲限制數量過小，勢必刺激上海米價上漲，米價漲後，一定刺激其他物價上漲，同時，也將刺激各地的米價與物價上漲。這個并非理論，過去的經騐憶經屢次告訴我們了。所以，我們一向反對在配給米未能足額未能準期以前，十石米以下的自由移動辦法，絕對不能取消，取消以後，必將刺激米價黑市及其他物價的上漲。而米統會便利內地收買米糧的理想，不會實現，且將適得其反。目前的米價黑市高漲，就是因爲取消十石以下米的自由移動辦法而刺激的，同時，內地米價也受影響上漲。所以，當初米統會堅持取消限制辦法，也許想不到會得到這樣結果的。　　昨天市政諮詢委員會對於米的問題，提出兩點重要建議，一是治標，一是治本，我們站在人民立塲，絕對擁護，希望市府當局對於第一個建議應斷然處置。第二個建議應積極進行。其實，第一個建議，我們記得從前公布十石米以下可以自由移運時，是由市政府與米統會共同會銜布告的。而現在取消前辦法，則由米統會單獨的片面公告的。市府迄今未見明白發表公告，僅見昨天經濟保安處五島處長的談話，要求人民協力遵守新辦法，是不是就算代表市府發言，希望市府當局應有明確表示。如果市府贊成取消，那末，市府在當初公布移動辦法時的意思，現在有沒有顧到，爲什麼輕易放棄。我們要求市政當局採納諮詢委員會的建議，斷然處置。　　近來常有人有意中傷，說我們對於民食特別重視，而對於公米不大注意。其實，這完全是信品雌黃。我們在五月十五日社評[再論糧食問題]中，早已提到：[在此戰時，公米第一，可無疑義]。我們向來主張，公米首要，兼及民食。我們所不辭爭執的，是米統會過去的人事，職權，技術等問題。我們始終相信米糧問題能完全交付最適當的中國人士辦理，則不但公米能圓滑供給，同時，民食也決不至於如此嚴重的地步。　　總之，米爲民食中最重要者，米糧問題就是最主要的民生問題，必須適合中國國情與民情，聽取人民大衆的意見而作決定，決不能取決於少數人的意見，而閉門造車，去年的痛苦經騐，不會遺忘吧！　　最後，今天本報譯載米統會副主任委員植田先生的答問，關於米統會的一般情形，其中對於輿論界的話，不免失之主觀情緒的辯護。我們過去對於米統會的言論，什麼地方不是建設性的？什麼地方[不見山而徒見樹]的？很想傾聆植田先生的指教。</p>
<h3>日美在太平洋上勢將展開大決戰美因補給綫增大已陷困境</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日末次信正海軍大將，於此間四日之每日新聞發表一文，謂今後於太平洋上，日·美勢將展開大決戰，爲決定勝負之原因，其內容要旨如次：現於太平洋正面，尤其於菲律賓方面已展開激烈之前哨戰，令人感覺戰機已漸成熟，但此決戰不單爲菲律賓羣島之爭奪戰，日本今後對南方資源地帶之連絡能否維持，皆視此次作戰之勝負決定，故此次乃係決定今後戰局之一大決戰。惟現在國民心中所認爲之決定，不外乎彼此兩軍主力相遇，一決勝負，然後戰爭大局即可決定，但由於飛機之飛躍進展，今日之戰術已與昔日不同，因之決戰機會亦與昔日相異，昔日之日本海海戰與設得蘭海戰，皆爲一決雌雄之機會，今日已不易獲得，總而言之，由一次戰鬥便可結束戰爭之情形，今日已不可能。但就作戰之原則言之，於決戰時無論如何必須舉全力將敵軍澈底潰滅。即所謂必要有或勝利或死之決意，此點與昔日並無何差異，於未來之決戰中，敵我即將舉全力以赴，故於一度作戰之後，彼此二軍必皆需相當時日恢復戰力，但就敵美軍之情形觀，一朝戰敗，於戰力恢復上必極困難，即或敵吾損失相等，勝敗不分，則恢復戰力較我更難。敵再企圖侵攻東亞，恐最少亦需半年或一年之久，此期間對於日本則非常有利，蓋今日飛機之製造速度，已異常進展，故空軍力易於恢復，旣有半年或一年之餘裕時間，縱聯合艦隊之海上兵力不能十分恢復，但空軍方面則可依空軍艦隊充實國防力量。至於未來之決戰，到底何時發生，今雖甚難預言，但就今日太平洋之情形觀之，早晚難免一戰，同時，本人並確信其爲長期戰，今後之太平洋作戰，敵軍方面以機動部隊席捲各地，乃不可能事實，因補給路之愈發延長，戰力上已自受限制，而日本方面則與此相反，即敵軍愈迫近日本土，日軍之反擊力亦必烈，至彼時，余確信敵軍終至損失至不能再損失之地步。至於決定態勢之物質，余以爲其要素並不在有形，而在無形，日軍於太平洋上之玉碎精神，余確信必將繼續至戰爭之最後，以護祖國。　　東京四日中央社電　此間軍事專家頃批評美軍於培里琉島苦戰之情形謂：敵尼米資與麥克沃塞，今已漸向日本本土及菲律賓接近，故彼我兩軍事決戰時機亦愈成熟，敵方亦承認由於接近之結果，其補給路綫已愈增大，因之於作戰上之困難，亦隨之作級數之增加。敵雖自恃物量，但仍難速決此項困難，現敵軍於帛琉羣島之培里琉島作戰所蒙之損失，已打破於太平洋作戰所有損失之紀錄，蓋敵軍之運輸量雖大，但敵於該島戰門中，飛機彈藥之補給，仍不足用，彼等遭日軍之反擊，憶蒙重大之損失。又因等待運輸接濟關係，仍極力避免戰鬥，由此亦可知敵之戰力如何低下。敵爲獲得進攻菲律賓之前進基地，方始企圖將帛琉羣島一舉攻下，唯現在已陷困境，以今日之情勢觀之，彼等於最近期中，終難克服此困難。</p>

<h3>吞敵的氣魄</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>戰局雖說危急，如統觀一九四一年十二月一日宣戰大詔頒發以來，第一期對日本會非常有利，第二期則對敵有利，現在業巳進入第三期，即最後的勝敗對敵有利，抑將對我有利這一點。所謂危急，也不過是這樣的危急。我們略對第一期和第二期加以檢討。這一檢討，完全根據當局所公佈的事實，同時也以當局所觀察的意見爲根據，暫不用私人的見解來描畫，請大家注意。　　第一期對於日本，誠可說大吉大利。冷不及防，偷襲夏威夷眞珠灣，和擊沉美國艦隊的開幕禮，繼而炸沉馬萊方面的英國主力艦，進而陸軍攻克香港，菲律濱，席捲馬來，緬甸，征服爪哇，婆羅洲，蘇門答臘，西里伯等。日本的海陸兩軍，正如疾風捲枯葉，亦如汽車在柏油馬路上行駛，眞是一帆風順的大吉大利。我們日本摧枯拉松的進攻了，正如燎原之火股的燃燒着，一直達到瓜達爾卡那爾島。　　自從瓜達爾卡那爾島轉進以來，我們日本會一再轉進。由所羅門羣島南方至北方之波根維爾，此外新幾內亞方面西端必阿克島，業已全都有了敵兵的踪跡。現在敵人已經深入到馬諾克瓦里了。拉巴爾固屬難攻易守的要塞，然而時至今日，敵人業已在阿德密拉提羣島等登陸了，現已作好航空基地。　　我們對於事實，一定要當作事實來談。談到這一點，固然令人摩拳擦掌，怒髪沖冠，但按當局所示，去年四月山本五十六聯合艦隊司令長官陣亡時，敵寇美國在阿留申羣島開始反攻，終於我們日本的山崎部隊在阿圖鳥·全軍壯烈犧牲。基斯加島因皇天保佑，而得以平安撤退。此外，去年秋天，美國艦隊在中部太平洋上開始反攻，佔領吉爾貝特羣島，而馬金島和塔拉瓦島上的四千五百將士，在柴崎中將的指揮下同歸於盡。佔領吉爾貝特羣島的美國艦隊，自從今年正月底至二月初，終於侵入我們日本領土的馬紹爾羣島了。美國在北方則開始攻擊庫埃茲林島及魯粵特島，其猛烈程序，是日軍向未所體騐者。襲擊吉爾貝特羣島時，美國也是一樣，會耗費了空家驚人的物量。例如：攻擊庫埃茲林和魯奧特兩島時，據說會動員二百萬噸的艦艇，兩師團的兵力，而消耗了一萬數千噸的砲彈及炸彈。守衛這兩個島的安田和山田兩部隊長以及六千五百將士，全員英勇殉國。　　至於敵方作戰的方法，即以西南太平洋協約國軍總司令麥克活塞所率領的大軍，由新幾內亞島向菲律賓進攻，再轉而向中國大陸前進；另外則以太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資的隊伍，由東向西突破，一舉而想取得日本的內南洋要衝。一則用新幾內亞戰綫配合着向西發展，他則由小笠原羣島北上，直搗日本本土，我認爲這個判斷，或許是不會錯誤的。　　至於美國海軍的企圖，軍事評論家漢遜·鮑爾特溫會在今年四月發表如下的文章：　　[中部太平洋即將成爲美國大攻勢的戰塲，美國軍隊的次一個目標，一定將在加羅林羣島實行迂廻，而進窺馬利亞納羣島的。佔領馬利亞納羣島後，再前進而攻菲律賓，甚至北上攻取台灣，小笠原羣島，日本本土等。此外在南太平洋，實質上使所羅門羣島北部，新不列顚，及其附近基地完全成爲麻　狀態，於是則對沿新幾內亞海岸西進的水陸兩用部隊，開放了向菲律賓跳躍的門戶。]　　鮑爾特溫的若干預見，今日完全實現了。美國所攻擊的目標，是日本本土和菲律賓。另外以餘力進佔荷印方面的物資，這是無容置疑的。—</p>

<h3>日軍完全佔領桂前衛據點閩江下流沿岸砲台擊毀</h3>
<p>華南前綫四日中央社電　日軍自突破廣東廣西省境以來，於西江南岸進擊中之一部先遣部隊，除急追渝軍外，並到處擊潰渝方之民團及自衛團。一日下午前九時半，終於完全佔領橫溪梧州容縣間之前衛據點，嶺溪去梧州西南五十公里，渝軍於前一日止，仍於嶺溪前面配備正規軍，及國民兵準備抵抗，但旋即被日軍擊破。現廣西前衛，已告崩潰，渝軍已不得不續向內地敗走。　　日軍前綫四日中央社電　日中國方面艦隊某部隊，廿七日晨於日陸軍部隊在福州附近登陸成功時，即由登陸地點南下，對閩江下流東海沿岸之渝軍某砲台，及其沿岸陣地，加以艦砲射擊，將其完全擊毀，予渝軍以重創。</p>
<h3>日將再度佔領福州</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據合衆社駐渝防員訊，日軍福州作戰狀況如次：日軍在福建省展開之登陸作戰，及進攻福州之作戰，東京方面業已正式發表。渝方對日軍此次作戰，認爲此乃日軍對抗美軍在中國大陸展開登陸作戰之當然行動。故僑居該省之外國人，已大部準備避難，然因無飛機，故欲圖逃往重慶地區，極感困難。目下所殘留之空隙僅九十餘公里而已。日本爲確保香港與國際聯絡路綫，必須封鎖此一空間隙，日軍會一度佔領福州，故再圖佔領，乃屬意中事云</p>
<h3>渝美飛機盲炸粵市</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　駐渝美空軍機數月以來，即利用月明潛入廣州，在市上空作長時間之飛翔，以示威力後，即向並無軍事設施之民宅，濫施轟炸，致使市民受極大之死傷。如上月三十日，亦會於市中央區投下大量之炸彈及燒夷彈，炸毀紅十字醫院及學校旅館，及其他設施。本月三日以前，仍連日不斷來襲，藉以進行其擾亂民心之神經戰，惟民心不特未見動搖，反而因美空軍之暴行，而更趨憤激云。</p>
<h3>渝承認日軍入平南</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍司令部發表，日軍三日已到達距桂林二十七公里地帶，現於該市東北湘桂鐵路綫附近，二十七公里乃至三十公里之各地區激戰中，又日軍巳突入平南。</p>

<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據瑞典阿夫通報駐華盛頓訪員訊，現美國正要求蔣介石氏積極參加戰爭，美國訪問重慶特使納爾遜返國後，曾向羅斯福報告日軍之進攻，仍在繼續威脅重慶，駐渝美空軍已被驅逐，喪失衡陽及零陸與麗水玉山之基地。在此戰局之下，美軍首腦部與蔣氏間意見，完全對立。美方因鑒於必須防衛各重要空軍基地，故希望訓練渝軍，然蔣氏則認爲美國應以其自國軍隊防衛之，一方蔣氏之最精銳部隊，則配置於北方邊區，以對付共產軍，而美國軍部則認渝軍擁有數百萬之衆，此際無須派遣美軍渡華。史蒂威爾提議建設重慶軍，使參加緬甸作戰，蔣氏對此亦表反對，不過僅容許其訓練數師渝軍而已。因美國會督促蔣氏改編渝軍，並努力改善對蘇關係，與延安進行交涉，蔣氏遂許可外國記者團訪問華北及延安，其與蘇聯亦開始交涉。傳蔣氏爲抑制通貸膨脹，已同意改編經濟之提議，渝方已對美國提出在重慶治下地域，再建設空軍基地之提案。又傳渝方主張採用，以一美元對法幣二十元之正式滙兌率云。</p>
<h3>粵加強防空設備</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社電粵市防空指揮部，最近已加強各區消防各項設備，更與市各保甲區取得密切聯絡，開始派員調查全市各區堅固樓宇，以備闢作市民避難室。並詳查全市荒廢地區，建造防空壕，擇定市內各繁盛區域，加建防空壁。</p>
<h3>中秋節後京市物價騰昂</h3>
<p>深盼當局速謀對策　　南京四日中央社電中秋節後京市各項物價，均有躍躍上騰之趨向，其中尤以菜蔬五洋棉製品等更爲堅悄，如此情形，影響所及，對於今後民生問題，關係於鉅。考其　結所在，不外乎因最近火車票等各項交通事業等費用增價，於是水漲船高，影響於一般單幫小販之成本。另一方面，則一般奸商利用關節時機，復施憤技，照例抬價。更以目下時屆深入，氣候轉寒，棉製品等銷路日廣，亦爲彼輩抬價之極好機會。是故深盼有關當局，速謀對策，一面大量疏暢來源，一面亟謀制止奸商抬價，務須標本兼施，庶物價問題，得告穩定。</p>
<h3>蘇軍準備冬季攻勢</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　蘇軍當局對巴爾幹戰綫，尤以舊南斯拉夫領內蘇軍之動向，雖未會發表，然東綫全部已入停頓狀態。據倫敦合衆社電，此間軍事專家認爲十一處之蘇聯戰綫軍，將再開始結集，準備冬季攻勢。由是蘇軍憶進入冬季攻勢之準備中。</p>
<h3>保加利亞陸軍歸蘇軍指揮</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據索菲亞電：保加利亞陸軍部頃發表，保政府循蘇軍司令部之要求，決將保軍編入蘇軍第三鳥克蘭戰綫軍。</p>
<h3>大批外藉軍隊參加西歐作戰</h3>
<p>齊格斐攻防戰益趨熾烈　　柏林四日中央社電德國社訊：反軸心軍在德國西部邊界與何蘭中部遭受重大損失後，現正在各該區出動更多之外藉軍隊。加拿大軍在沿海岸担任進攻堡壘之工作，同時法比荷渡軍編隊，則在德國西綫之其他地區作戰，甚至中國兵與捷克兵亦被拼合在反軸心軍隊中。又據可靠方面消息：自一八九七至一九二六年等級之法國男子徵兵準備，現已完成，荷蘭亦已開始招兵之措施。　　里斯本四日中央社電　荷蘭中部安享附近英第一降落傘師被殲滅之當時，已預計反軸心軍將於其他地區發動大攻勢，今果有於德比國境亞琛地區開始最大攻勢，正面突擊齊格斐戰綫之勢。傳亞琛地區之反軸心軍，具有相當數量之轟炸機，似以英第一軍爲主力，於幅圓約六公里廣之地繼續前進。同時美第三軍於法國東北部貝爾福區亦整備總攻擊。若果如此，則安亨附近之傘兵攻擊，可視爲西綫決戰之第一階段，刻正進行中之亞琛貝爾福地區之攻擊，可視爲第二階段。德軍反攻亦極熾烈，故齊格斐綫兩軍陷入對峙狀態，其戰爭或轉爲長期戰。於此種情形下，冬季之補給問題，於將來戰局上，不容反軸心軍樂觀，艾森霍華司令部對此或亦深知</p>
<h3>德軍新銳調赴前綫</h3>
<p>亞琛地區二日又發生激戰，反軸心軍於機甲部隊及重砲掩護下，佔領亞琛北方八公里之小邨鳥溫哈，死守萊因工業地帶之德軍，對此之反攻極爲激烈，刻續以新銳武器兵員向該方面集中攻擊。德軍司令部發表萊因河下游及烏爾河地區之德軍，仍保持日前之優勢，擊退英軍之反擊。又尼美根南方地區演成壯烈之機甲戰，但戰綫無大轉變。荷蘭境內戰事爲大水所阻，暫呈停頓。德元首行營於三日發表杜佛沿岸之加萊已陷落。</p>
<h3>德宣傳次長演說表明殲敵決心</h3>
<p>白金漢宮遭飛彈襲擊　　柏林四日中央社電德宣傳部次長羅滿博士，在西部國境某大工業都市之民氣昂揚大會上發表演說，謂目前西綫之移動戰，廣汎戰綫上分散之德軍已予以集中，當可設定新戰綫，盡力強化西部要塞。敵軍雖於法國奪回德軍之優越地位，然因英美軍之困難甚多，不能獲得勝利，西歐之鐵道設施，德軍於撤退時完全破壞。德軍指導部對敵空軍必予擊潰，若英國以德國喪失在法之星流彈發射基地，英國之空中威脅即隨之解除，此可謂完全錯誤。德軍指導部從未作僅依新兵器轉換戰局之想像，然強化德國科學陣容，以世界上最優秀之德國科學界發明之本能，挽回祖國之困苦，則爲當注力者。　　里斯本四日中央社電　德軍之新兵器攻擊，依然繼續中。據倫敦息，白金漢宮殿之庭園，於二日蒙受甚大損害。</p>
<h3>羅斯福簽署戰後法案</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓息：羅斯福總統昨簽署若干法案，使美國之軍備工業於戰事結束後，回復平時之情形。該法案中包括將固有之工廠及其原料存貨，合法移交於私人企業，該法案并禁止軍人保留其武器，以防失業。</p>
<h3>渝使節訪問羅斯福</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據華盛頓電：出席英美渝會談之渝方首席代表顧維鈞·駐美大使魏道明·軍事使節團團長商震等，三日於美國務次官伴同下，前赴白宮訪問羅斯福，會談約十分鐘。至於渝方代表訪問之目的及會談內容并未發表。</p>
<h3>英蘇工會領袖將舉行會議</h3>
<p>百倫四日中央社電德國社訊，據英京消息：蘇聯工會領袖六人，由蘇聯工會聯盟主席柯茲尼卓夫率領，已抵達倫敦，彼等將與英工會領袖舉行若干次會議。</p>
<h3>蔣與哈萊會談深慮中國赤化</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據重慶消息稱，駐重慶之美軍事使節哈萊，前會與蔣介石氏會談六次。傳當時蔣氏會對哈萊謂，重慶軍當局，自六年前爲防止中共在邊疆之叛亂，即在西北方面配備大軍，直至今日，方得一面與中共對抗，一面繼續抗日。如英美漠視中國現在危機，恐中國抗日之結果，即將形成中國大陸之全部赤化云云。反之，哈萊則答謂美國並非坐視重慶之危機，唯現在除印緬空輸以外，並無別法接濟，故今後美國於中國大陸之戰略，依日軍作戰之發展如何，將有根本變更之必要。</p>
<h3>孟買會談決裂原因</h3>
<p>甘地發表聲明　　里斯本四日中央社電　孟買會談決裂之主因，顯係關于建立回教徒獨立國之問題，對於舉行國民投票之主張相異所致。茲據孟買電稱，甘地翁于三日接見記者時，特發表聲明，謂會談決裂之原因，係因余未同意基那所希望即刻承認西北國境爲完全獨立之回教徒國之主張，渠並表示希望不先經國民投票之手續，而獲得承認，然余當時未能以個人資格或其他資格，以同意數百萬以上州民關于彼等自身命運及將來之提議。又余主張印度于變更地圖前，應脫離英國之支配，獲得自由，而基那則主張即刻承認回印分治。此外關於回教徒國與印度教徒國間之關係事，余希望兩國實施共通政策，以便彼此于行政外，在國防及交通各方面相互調和，蓋此不僅謀兩國之利益，且於兩國主權上亦不相抵觸。總之，吾等之會談，係以友人之立塲而舉行，余希望我等能再作會談。</p>
<h3>問</h3>
<p>米糧收買期快到了，本年度的收買方針較去年度有何改革，聽說已確定了內地重心主義，是嗎？</p>
<h3>內地重心主義</h3>
<p>答　去年度工作不順利的原因，雖有幾點，但重要原因可說是收買的開始太遲。鑒於去年度的寶貴經騐，本年九月間，新辦事處已設置告竣，一登塲即同時開始收買的體制，已告完成。故至少關於這一佔可不致重蹈去年的覆轍。比去年度約早二個月即已準備就緒。對各地中日軍方官方關係當局的盡力協助，深表感謝。在收買機構方面，在收買方法方面，確如所傳，採取內地重心主義的新方針。　　第一，關於機構的一點，在各主要收買據點設置地區辦事處，以此爲中心，集中各地直接間接的收買力，賦與比去年更強力的權力與更重大的責任，充分發揮收買上地區的機動性。　　第二，關於價格政策，亦適應機構，加以特別考慮，使能充分發揮機動性。本來當開始收買時，即發表公定價格，以此爲標準實施收買，不幸公定的最高價格成爲最低價格，結果，作繭自縛，自己爲所定的價格政策所苦。現對此點已大加考慮，採取以不變臨變的有伸縮性的價格政策，但這並不是說採取追隨黑市的無方針的價格政策，不動的對策業已確立，惟　奸商利用這對策的方法，則儘量設法避免。　　第三，關於資金之點，擬充分尊重內地的機動性。各地區有指定銀行，指定商以辦事處爲中心，使能適時適地的利用資金，防止資金不正用的方法亦已準備，嚴厲取締資金用於不正當的用途。今當登塲期，各地區資金的準備，約略完備，採辦商開始收買時，不致遭遇資金上的困難。要之，基於去年的經騐，在準備工作方面，確已實施了相當改革。收買工作即將開始，惟願順利成功。　　但有一點得聲明，所謂內地重心主義，並不是內地割據主義。上海與內地如車之兩輪，應同時並進。因此，須加強與各區的聯絡。故整頓本部的機構，竭盡微力，從全國的立塲，凡有利於內地收買的條件，擬儘量提供。　　問　蘇浙皖米榖運銷管理暫行條例的公佈施行如何？</p>
<h3>新條例的遵行</h3>
<p>答　這條例比別種物資的運銷管理方策相富有力。從米糧問題的性質而言，此爲富然的歸趨。由於軍官民的一致協力，切盼這條例的旨趣得以徹底實踐。這條例中，對於妨害米糧的運銷者，規定處以十年以下的拘役，百萬元以下的罰金。但担任米統會工作的自身，須切實實行這條文，確信關係當局必將予以特別協助。又在運銷管理條理公布之先，原有的上海米糧護照辦法之廢止，業經行政院通過實施，一部分人視爲實際上禁止八公斤以上的食米搬入上海，而加以非難，殊屬不當。今當開始收買時期，過去作爲臨時辦法而採取的搬入方法，任令繼續下去，顯然阻害內地收買工作的順利進行，成爲有利於私運的條件。舊護照辦法的廢止，我們確信是應取的措置。　　問　今春以來，米糧問題成爲輿論的焦點。輿論對於米統會期望甚殷，而米統會當事者所期於輿論者亦綦切。關於此點如何？</p>
<h3>虛心接收輿論</h3>
<p>答　對於從大局着眼的建設性輿論，自應虛心接受，但不見山徒見樹的輿論，旣不利於米統會，亦不利於民衆。米糧與別種物資不同，關係民衆生活最深，故對於米糧統制，當然特別關心。惟願爲建設性的，勿徒事悲觀，對於建設的努力方面，願加以充分的關心與注意。我們所希望的言論，是從使米統會在收買上能夠成功的立塲發出的言論。　　問　并上麥統會主任委員，會聲述確立收買農產物各統制委員會之一元的共同前進體制之秘要。此不全體而言，似爲重要的問題，高見如何？　　答　誠然。例如小麥與米，收買時期不同，故如并上先生所稱之倉庫問題，充分具有合理性。據我之見，農產物收買機關能夠一元化自然最好，應協力的問題也很多，均爲很重要的問題，目前的對策，如舉行聯絡懇談會等等，希望能夠實現。</p>
<h3>米價對策問題</h3>
<p>問　關於米價的對策如何？　　答　米價的問題，結果是收買問題，配給問題。收買如能成功，配給即能強文學配給如能強化，黑市即能低落。今爲收買期，亦即爲米價即收買問題之單純明確的理論之實踐時期。其次，米價問題，單由米價對策來解，極爲困難，故切望實施全面的物價安定政策。　　問　最後呢？　　答　米統會江蘇辦事處成立大會上，我會說過下面幾句話，現再重述一遍：　　我們常以下列四項爲念，向米糧統制邁進：　　○我們收買戰時下必要的米糧，以貢獻於完遂大東亞戰爭。　　○我們對農民粒粒皆辛苦的結晶，應以感謝之意處之。　　○我們鑒於米糧爲一切物心的原動力，應常銘其重責與名譽。　　○我們應除私心從事工作，實現中日提携的眞面目。　　上述雖極爲抽象，担願在這信念之下，向所負責任邁進。（翔：譯自十月四日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>諮詢會建議市府寬限米糧移動十石以下自由搬動暢通米源</h3>

<h3>致市府請寬米限書</h3>
<p>查本市戶口配給米糧爲量旣不充足，大部份仰給於負販，是以本市米價之漲落，直接影響民生，本會代表民意，不憚煩賣，一再函達貴府在案，近據米統會米通字第二號通告，據稱奉行政院訓令，廢止該會前訂之米糧搬入本市申請及頒發護照辦法發表之後，米價突高，設若當局不能採取有效措置，本市民生問題，必更嚴重，本會特再鄭重建議，請貴府即日電呈行政院，請予恢復本市民食米十石以下，搬運不必領照辦法，並轉商米統會設法暢通米糧來源，以裕民食，而平米價，並請令知警局，在行政院對恢復米糧十石以下自由移動辦法未會決定以前，對於米糧移動之取締，暫照舊章執行，以安人心，而維民食。</p>
<h3>疏散人口建議辦法</h3>

<h3>取締鐵路車僮敲詐</h3>
<p>查近年來京滬滬杭甬兩路，在華中鐵道公司經營之下，因戰時車輛缺乏，旅客購票異常困難，凡會搭乘該兩路旅行之市民，俱能道之毌庸贅述，近來華鐵改良售票辦法，取締黑市車票等舉措，頗見積極，顯見當局蓄意整頓路政，改善客運之苦心，乃成效尚未顯着，而車站及車中又添設一批車僮，衣黑色制服，並無標誌番號，專對旅客敲詐，如狼如虎，勒索款項，無所不至。據耳聞所及，並見報章刋載者，其具體事實，約有下列各端違定章，應予沒收，否則應私行向其納貼數千元，或數百元方可了事，旅客膽怯者，誠恐節外生枝，致誤行程，不得不忍痛行賄，塡其慾壑，即欲與抗爭者，亦因車僮制服上並無標誌番號，且旅客擁擠，向其上峰指控，甚爲不易，故皆敢怒而不敢言。○在上述勒索情形之下，如有膽敢抗拒被檢查，或不允另納小費者，則恒有私被三數車僮擠軋至隱僻之所，例如厠所等處，合力痛毆，或剝去全身衣服情事，至於所帶行李錢鈔，全數被搶，更屬題中應有之義矣。○凡身帶行李之旅客，不論是否爲小販車僮須逐人計件索費，例如帶來一小包須出費數十元至百元，否則行李即有被以小刀劃碎之虞，此種劣跡，每班火車，均屬如此，無能倖免者。　　查目前旅客購票困難，怨聲載道，實因煤炭缺乏，車次減少，原非人力所能挽救之事，而無端又添設此種有弊無利之車僮，絕未見春於值勤時對旅客有何服務，而反增旅客的種種意外之壓迫，雖或華鐵當局別有用心，外界不便臆測，顧此種劣跡昭彰之事實，必須即速改革，以安行旅，爰特不揣謭陋，擬具管見數項如左：○華鐵車僮依目前情形，祗知敲詐魚肉旅客，甚少其他工作，似可速予裁撤遣散。○如每列車上仍須酌設車僮，以照料乘客者，則制服上應有顯明之姓名及號數。○每一輛車內，須揭貼巨幅之佈告，說明祗有憲警及車長，方有檢查車票及行李之權，其他任何人員，不論是否穿着制服，均不得越規行事，如有故違，可向指定處所（例如站長室在站內何處或車長室在車上何處等）控告。○車站及車上應多設紀律嚴整之憲兵或警士，並多派較爲高級之路員，隨時巡邏，以制止非法暴行。○如查獲車僮或其他人員，再有上述越規行爲時，應嚴加懲處，以儆刁頑。</p>

<h3>米統會職員瀆職案昨審結</h3>
<p>定九日上午宣判　　本市米統會總務處第二科辦事員榮惠人，於本年六月二十日，受無錫商人鮑明祥委託，有米六十石，擬由橫林運滬，由鮑向親友借得市民證六張，託榮向米統會採運處第三科代領米糧搬入證明單，榮固設法得搬入證六張，交與鮑明祥，六月二十三日鮑即憑證將米六十石運滬，榮於此次，確未受鮑任何酬報，七月九日，鮑又有米一百八十石，擬由橫林運滬，仍託榮一併設法代借，并約定凡借市民證者以出售廉價米一石爲報酬。（所謂廉價米即與本市黑市價格相差約三四千元）惟榮僅借得市民證一張，其餘十七張，則由榮另託科長陳垣向各同事代借，并託陳向各同事說明，日後米到上海，每人亦得購廉價米一石。七月十日榮即將搬入證十八張交與鮑明祥，鮑即於七月十五日將社米一百八十石計一百三十包，運至上海。七月十五日出售與米統會庶務科三十八包，中儲行九十一包，每石價一萬五百元，另以二萬元爲津貼榮之車馬費。旋經本市經濟保安處獲悉，將榮等三人拘獲解送檢察署偵查，各被告均供認不諱，查搬運米糧超過十石以上，米統會得照公定價格徵購三成，榮惠人貪圖酬報，代鮑借市民證十八張，朦領搬運證，將米一百八十石化整爲零，避免徵購，公務員意圖不法利益，實犯刑法二百十四條。陳垣代借市民證，知情而仍參加舞弊，應以共同犯論處，鮑明祥亦應依照刑法第二百十六條處斷，爰由地檢署檢察官孫家傑依刑事訴訟法第三百二十條第一項一併提起公訴，該案業於上月間由地院開審，昨日上午由于彌推事在刑入庭繼續審訊，各被各僅謂代借市民證申領米糧搬入證，在米統會內係平常之事，不能謂舞弊，并稱米統會據前主任委員袁履登在米統會會刋上所稱，係商業自治集團，故彼等并非公務員，不能以公務員論治罪。庭上以案情已白，即定本月九日上午正式宣判。</p>

<h3>福利足球第一次賽昨不歡而散</h3>
<p>廣東實業界百萬元購球　　本年度福利足球賽第一砲，東華對僑聯，於昨日下午五時，在黃陂路跑馬廳球塲舉行，觀衆空前踴躍，不下萬餘人，由社會福利部丁部長行開球禮，比賽中途，並由公用局長葉雪松夫人拍賣義球，爲廣東實業界代表餘穉敬，出價一百萬元買去，開球賽拍賣義球之新紀錄。此次比賽收入，悉數撥充滬廣東慈善機關經費。惜乎昨賽至最後十五分鐘，僑聯隊員因不服裁判員判決，全隊悄然離塲，以致未得結果，不歡而散，深爲美中不足。</p>
<h3>小起衝突繼續比賽</h3>
<p>昨秋高氣爽，下午五時正，由丁部長開球，雙方比賽即行開始，東華首處逆風地位，故球常在東華區域盤旋，僑聯本季因得天津三虎將參加，故實力殊覺充沛，鮑傑巴瑪屢次獲得射門良機，均因腳頭太野，致未能建功，不料比賽至上半時臨終前二十分鐘，雙方球員因悮會小起衝突，僑聯隊隊長麥尼蒂即命令全體隊員出塲，不願繼續比賽，致比賽停止，幸經西部長等加以婉勸後，即重行入塲比賽，未幾東華戴麟經得賈幼良之助打破紀錄，上半時東華，即以一對零佔先。</p>
<h3>麥尼蒂率全隊離塲</h3>
<p>休息拍賣義球後，再行比賽，未及五分鐘，東華李垚又行建功，成二對零，僑聯此時力加反攻，果於二十分鐘間，先後由馬瑪，鮑傑，亞托馬利等打入三球，反以三對二佔先，是時雙方表演緊張，旋僑聯守衛犯規，被罰十二碼，由孫錦順主踢，麥尼蒂因裁判員吹笛前身體先動，故由裁判何春輝判令重罰，是時僑聯隊長麥尼蒂，又令全體隊員出塲，致比賽又行停止，雖經各方調解，麥氏亦均置之不願。查隊員在比賽之時，須絕對服從裁判員，如有不服，須在比賽後再行提出抗議，是始可謂運動道德精神，今麥氏每以出塲爲威脅，深以爲憾。幸此次觀衆秩序良好，未有意外事件發生。</p>

<h3>近來的青年（一）</h3>
<p>第二天的新聞上，整個篇幅都在發表着軍神九勇士的故事。　　隆夫想到昨夜的夢境，而就注意地凝視眞人的照片。眞人在二中時代當考試時，往往輕輕閉着嘴唇，而向前面正視着。這樣表情後，眞人就露出那樣排列整齊的白牙齒來，而微微地笑起來。　　在乾的報紙上，出了一個聲音，這就是隆夫的淚，滴在紙上了。　　他的眼睛稍微看了一會兒軍神的照片（喂，這幅面孔是誰？）　　他回想起福田旅館裹所碰到的人們來。海軍的人太多了，所以同名同姓以及面目相同者，都是很多的，湯淺中校，新田少校——呵，想起來了，當時最愛開玩笑的上尉，就是姓湯淺的。領導參觀潛水學校的少尉，就是姓新田的。固然會過一次面是無法完全憶出怎樣的面孔來，然而總覺得在什麼地方看見過他們的面孔。　　（假如那時的士官就是這批人：：那末：）　　隆夫五體投地之感激。於是，隆夫覺得非常後悔，爲什麼當時不要一張名片，連名帶姓的牢牢記住呵？　　（不，縱令不是那批人，而只要是和眞人共同作此壯舉的人，對於我都是有無上之緣的。）　　他聽到升上校的無綫電廣播，而知道了和勇士的出身，以及縱容就義的精神，更加佩服了。手拿汽水和巧克利，眞有點海闊天空的味道——說這樣話的年青士官，固然不知是誰，但這足能代表九軍神的不可動搖的浩然之氣。　　（決非一時之勇。如不是持久的敢死決心，是不會產生這各心境的。）　　隆夫在心板上想像一個母艦的房間裹，準備出發完了的人們，呈現着愉快的神情。靜靜地研着墨，四位士官湊到一處在寫遺囑，這種情景，也在隆夫的心板上反復地映現着。　　斷而行之，鬼神避之！　　　　　海軍中尉　谷眞人　　隆夫目不轉睛地凝視着報紙上出現的知已之遺留筆跡。　　（這兩句，是眞人在二中時代就永不離口的。這原來是菊池配屬將校的口頭語……）　　好像活生生地又出現在面前，這位穿着灰色水手服的眞人中學生裝。也似乎看見了他在天保出濱硬着頭皮咬着牙根在晒背的樣子。同時還在心板上浮現出那以前，在八幡小學鐵柱上，牢牢不放鬆的姿態。小小的靈魂。竟有這樣大的作爲——（一四八）</p>

        <h1>1944.10.05</h1>
<h3>The Urgent Need to Focus on the Rice Problem</h3>
<p>Since the assistance received from Allied nations during August and September to resume household rice rations, without delays or reductions, and simultaneously implementing the policy of free transport of rice under ten "shi" (石, a unit of dry measure, about 100 liters), rice prices were temporarily stabilized, bringing joy to the citizens.</p>
<p>Regarding household rice rations after October, it is said that the Rice Control Committee authorities have repeatedly expressed great confidence. This is the first piece of good news since the reorganization of the Rice Control Committee. We also believe that the Rice Control Committee has made good arrangements and sufficient preparations for the rationed rice after October, over the long period of August and September, and will not lose the trust of the citizens. However, during this period, the policy of transporting rice under ten "shi" was suddenly abolished, and changed to allowing free transport of only up to eight kilograms. The significance of this change in policy, it is said, is that after this restriction, it will make it difficult for rice from the interior to come to Shanghai, and the price of rice in the interior can be reduced, thus facilitating the purchase of low-priced rice in various regions.</p>
<p>However, our view differs. Because the restricted quantity is too small, it will inevitably stimulate the rise of rice prices in Shanghai. After the rise in rice prices, it will definitely stimulate the rise of other commodity prices, and at the same time, it will also stimulate the rise in rice and commodity prices in various regions. This is not just a theory; past experiences have repeatedly told us so. Therefore, we have always opposed the cancellation of the free movement of rice under ten "shi" before the rationed rice can be fully supplied and on time. Once it is canceled, it will inevitably stimulate the rise of rice prices on the black market and other commodity prices. And the Rice Control Committee's ideal of facilitating the purchase of rice in the interior will not be realized, and will be counterproductive. The current high rice prices on the black market are stimulated by the cancellation of the free movement of rice under ten "shi," and at the same time, rice prices in the interior have also been affected and have risen. Therefore, the Rice Control Committee initially insisted on canceling the restrictions, perhaps not expecting to get such a result.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee put forward two important suggestions on the rice problem, one is a symptomatic treatment and the other is a fundamental solution. Standing on the position of the people, we absolutely support them, and hope that the Municipal Government authorities will decisively deal with the first suggestion and actively implement the second one. In fact, regarding the first suggestion, we remember that when the free movement of rice under ten "shi" was announced, it was jointly announced by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee. And now the cancellation of the previous policy is a unilateral announcement by the Rice Control Committee alone. The Municipal Government has not yet clearly issued an announcement. Only the speech of Director Gojima of the Economic Security Department yesterday asked the people to cooperate and abide by the new policy. Does this count as speaking on behalf of the Municipal Government? We hope that the Municipal Government authorities should have a clear statement. If the Municipal Government agrees to the cancellation, then what did the Municipal Government mean when it announced the mobile policy at the beginning, and why did it give up so easily? We ask the Municipal Government authorities to adopt the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and deal with it decisively.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have deliberately slandered us, saying that we pay special attention to people's food, but not much attention to government rice. In fact, this is completely a malicious slander. In our editorial on May 15, [Further Discussion on the Food Problem], we have already mentioned: [In this wartime, government rice comes first, there is no doubt about it]. We have always advocated that government rice is the most important, and people's food is also important. What we have been arguing about is the past personnel, powers, and technical issues of the Rice Control Committee. We have always believed that if the rice problem can be completely handed over to the most appropriate Chinese personnel, not only can government rice be supplied smoothly, but at the same time, the people's food will never be so serious.</p>
<p>In short, rice is the most important of the people's food, and the rice problem is the most important livelihood problem. Decisions must be made in accordance with China's national conditions and public sentiment, and listening to the opinions of the masses of the people. Decisions cannot be made based on the opinions of a few people, and behind closed doors. The painful experience of last year will not be forgotten!</p>
<p>Finally, today, our newspaper translates and publishes the Q&amp;A of Mr. Ueda, Deputy Director of the Rice Control Committee, regarding the general situation of the Rice Control Committee. Among them, the remarks on the media are inevitably defensive from a subjective point of view. Regarding our past remarks about the Rice Control Committee, where were they not constructive? Where did we [fail to see the forest for the trees]? We would like to listen to Mr. Ueda's advice.</p>
<h3>The US and Japan Are About to Engage in a Decisive Battle in the Pacific; the US Is Trapped Due to Increased Supply Lines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Retired Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, on the 4th, published an article in the Mainichi Shimbun, stating that in the future, Japan and the US will engage in a decisive battle in the Pacific, and the reason for determining the outcome will be as follows: Fierce preliminary battles have already begun on the Pacific front, especially in the Philippines, giving the feeling that the opportunity for battle has gradually matured. However, this decisive battle is not only a battle for the Philippine Islands. Whether Japan can maintain its connection to the southern resource zone in the future depends on the outcome of this battle. Therefore, this is a major decisive battle that will determine the future war situation. However, what the people think of as a decisive battle is nothing more than the main forces of the two armies meeting each other, fighting a decisive battle, and then the overall situation of the war can be determined. However, due to the rapid advancement of aircraft, today's tactics are different from those of the past, and therefore the opportunity for a decisive battle is also different from the past. The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland in the past were all opportunities to determine the winner, but today they are not easy to obtain. In short, the situation where a war can be ended by one battle is impossible today. However, in terms of the principle of combat, in a decisive battle, we must do everything possible to completely annihilate the enemy. That is to say, there must be a determination to either win or die. This point is no different from the past. In the future decisive battle, the enemy and we will go all out. Therefore, after one battle, both armies will need considerable time to restore their combat power. However, judging from the situation of the enemy, the US military, once defeated, it will be extremely difficult to restore its combat power. Even if the enemy and we suffer equal losses, and the victory or defeat is not determined, it will be even more difficult for them to restore their combat power than for us. If the enemy tries to invade East Asia again, it will probably take at least six months or a year. This period is very favorable to Japan. Because today the manufacturing speed of aircraft has advanced abnormally, so air force power is easy to restore. Since there is a surplus time of six months or a year, even if the naval power of the Combined Fleet cannot be fully restored, the air force can rely on the air fleet to strengthen national defense. As for when the future decisive battle will occur, it is difficult to predict today. However, judging from the current situation in the Pacific, a battle is inevitable sooner or later. At the same time, I am convinced that it will be a long-term war. In future Pacific operations, it is impossible for the enemy to sweep across various places with mobile units, because the more the supply line is extended, the more limited its combat power will be. On the other hand, Japan is the opposite, that is, the closer the enemy approaches the Japanese mainland, the more fierce the Japanese army's counterattack will be. At that time, I am convinced that the enemy will eventually be lost to the point where it cannot be lost any more. As for the material that determines the situation, I think its elements are not in the tangible, but in the intangible. I am confident that the spirit of "Gyokusai" (玉砕, honorable death in battle) of the Japanese army in the Pacific will continue to the end of the war to protect the motherland.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Military experts here recently criticized the difficult battle of the US military on Peleliu Island, saying: Nimitz and MacArthur are now gradually approaching the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. Therefore, the timing of the decisive battle between our two armies is also becoming more mature. The enemy also admits that as a result of the approach, its supply lines have increased, and therefore the difficulties in combat have also increased exponentially. Although the enemy relies on the amount of supplies, it is still difficult to quickly resolve this difficulty. The losses suffered by the enemy army in the battle on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands have broken all records of losses in the Pacific War. Although the enemy's transportation volume is large, the enemy's supply of aircraft ammunition in the island battle is still insufficient. They suffered heavy losses from the Japanese army's counterattack. Also, due to the need to wait for transportation and assistance, they are still trying to avoid combat. From this, it can also be seen how low the enemy's combat power is. In order to obtain an advanced base for attacking the Philippines, they initially tried to capture the Palau Islands in one fell swoop, but now they are in trouble. Judging from today's situation, they will eventually have difficulty overcoming this difficulty in the near future.</p>

<h3>National Government Issues Order to Honor He Hanlan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Mr. He Hanlan, Commander of the Guangzhou Naval Base, was assassinated by thugs in Yue (Guangdong) on the 25th of last month and died.

<h3>Universities in Yu, Xiang, Gui, and Yu Area Prepare to Relocate</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - The Japanese army's major offensive in the three provinces of Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi has had a profound impact on Yu, and the cultural aspects of the above areas are particularly affected. Among them, the universities are currently preparing to relocate, and the Yu authorities are also actively requesting measures to accommodate these students. According to the Chongqing Central News Agency on the 3rd, Henan University in Zhenping in southwestern Henan Province, Guangxi University scattered between Guilin and Wuzhou, and Zhongshan University in Pingshi in the northern part of Guangdong Province have decided to relocate to Jingziguan (Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei provincial border), Rongxian (northern Guizhou Province), Linwu (southern Hunan Province), and Dongpo Pingshi (northern Guangdong Province), respectively.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy</h3>
<p>- Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>Although the war situation can be said to be critical, if we look at the big picture since the issuance of the declaration of war on December 1, 1941, the first phase would be very favorable to Japan, the second phase would be favorable to the enemy, and now we have entered the third phase. Whether the final victory or defeat will be favorable to the enemy or to us is a point to be determined. What is called critical is just such a critical situation. Let us briefly review the first and second phases. This review is entirely based on the facts announced by the authorities, and also based on the opinions observed by the authorities. For the time being, we will not use personal opinions to describe it. Please pay attention. The first phase was truly auspicious and prosperous for Japan. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the opening ceremony of sinking the American fleet were followed by the sinking of the British main fleet in Malaya, and then the army captured Hong Kong and the Philippines, swept through Malaya and Burma, and conquered Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, etc. The Japanese navy and army were like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves, and like a car driving on an asphalt road, it was truly smooth sailing, auspicious, and prosperous. Our Japanese offensive, like the destruction of dry wood, was burning like a prairie fire, reaching Guadalcanal Island. Since the retreat from Guadalcanal Island, we Japanese have retreated again and again. From the southern Solomon Islands to Bougainville in the north, and in New Guinea, the western end of Biak Island has already had traces of enemy troops. Now the enemy has penetrated into Manokwari. Rabaul is originally an easy-to-defend and difficult-to-attack fortress, but today, the enemy has landed on the Admiralty Islands and other places, and has prepared an air base. We must talk about the facts as facts. Talking about this point certainly makes people clench their fists and become furious, but according to the authorities, when Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet died in action last April, the enemy, the United States, began its counter-offensive in the Aleutian Islands, and finally our Japanese Yamazaki Detachment sacrificed heroically in the entire army on Attu Island. Kiska Island was able to withdraw safely thanks to the blessing of the Emperor. In addition, last fall, the American fleet began its counter-offensive in the Central Pacific, occupying the Gilbert Islands, and 4,500 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant General Shibazaki died together on Makin Island and Tarawa Island. The American fleet that occupied the Gilbert Islands finally invaded the Marshall Islands, our Japanese territory, from the end of January to the beginning of February this year. The United States began attacking Kuezhlin Island and Ruote Island in the north, and the intensity of the attack was something that the Japanese army had never experienced before. When attacking the Gilbert Islands, the United States also expended a shockingly large amount of material. For example, when attacking Kuezhlin and Ruote Islands, it is said that they mobilized 2 million tons of ships, two divisions of troops, and consumed 11,000 tons of artillery shells and bombs. The commanders of these two islands, Yasuda and Yamada, and 6,500 soldiers all died heroically. As for the enemy's method of operation, the large army led by General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, advances from New Guinea towards the Philippines, and then turns to advance towards the Chinese mainland; on the other hand, the troops of Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, break through from east to west, and want to seize the key points of Japan's Inner South Seas in one fell swoop. I think this judgment may not be wrong. As for the intentions of the U.S. Navy, military commentator Hanson Baldwin published the following article in April of this year: [The Central Pacific will soon become the battlefield for the major U.S. offensive. The next target of the U.S. military must be to carry out a detour in the Caroline Islands and then peek into the Mariana Islands. After occupying the Mariana Islands, they will advance to attack the Philippines, and even go north to capture Taiwan, the Ogasawara Islands, the Japanese mainland, etc. In addition, in the South Pacific, virtually make the northern Solomon Islands, New Britain, and its nearby bases completely paralyzed, and then open the door to the Philippines for the amphibious forces advancing west along the New Guinea coast.] Some of Baldwin's predictions have come true today. The target of the U.S. attack is the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. In addition, with the remaining strength, they will occupy the resources of the Dutch East Indies. There is no doubt about this.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Completely Occupies Guilin's Forward Stronghold; Coastal Batteries Downstream of Min River Destroyed</h3>
<p>South China Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - Since breaking through the border of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, a vanguard force of the Japanese army advancing on the south bank of the West River, in addition to rapidly pursuing the Yu army, also defeated the Yu army's militia and self-defense forces everywhere. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, they finally completely occupied the forward stronghold between Hengxi, Wuzhou, and Rongxian. Lingxi is 50 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou. As of the day before, the Yu army was still deploying regular troops and national soldiers in front of Lingxi in preparation for resistance, but they were soon defeated by the Japanese army. Now, the Guangxi front has collapsed, and the Yu army has no choice but to continue to retreat inland.</p>
<p>Japanese Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese China Area Fleet, on the morning of the 27th, when the Japanese army successfully landed near Fuzhou, went south from the landing point and subjected a certain Yu army battery on the coast downstream of the Min River and its coastal positions to naval gunfire, completely destroying them and inflicting heavy damage on the Yu army.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Reoccupy Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the Japanese army's operational situation in Fuzhou is as follows: The Japanese army's landing operation in Fujian Province and the operation to attack Fuzhou have been officially announced by Tokyo. The Yu side believes that this operation by the Japanese army is a natural action to counter the US military's landing operation on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, most of the foreigners residing in the province have prepared to take refuge, but because there are no planes, it is extremely difficult to escape to the Chongqing area. The remaining gap is currently only over ninety kilometers. In order to ensure the international communication route with Hong Kong, Japan must block this gap. The Japanese army once occupied Fuzhou, so reoccupying it is to be expected.</p>
<h3>Yu American Planes Blindly Bomb Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - For several months, the Yu-based American air force has been taking advantage of the moonlight to sneak into Guangzhou, flying over the city for a long time to show its power, and then indiscriminately bombing civilian residences without any military facilities, causing great casualties to the citizens. For example, on the 30th of last month, a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs were also dropped in the central area of the city, destroying the Red Cross Hospital, schools, hotels, and other facilities. Before the 3rd of this month, they continued to attack day after day, using this to carry out their psychological warfare to disturb the people's hearts. However, not only has the people's hearts not been shaken, but on the contrary, they have become more angry because of the atrocities of the American air force.</p>
<h3>Yu Admits Japanese Troops Entered Pingnan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing news, the Yu military headquarters announced that Japanese troops had reached an area 27 kilometers from Guilin on the 3rd, and fierce fighting is currently underway in various areas 27 to 30 kilometers near the Xiang-Gui Railway line northeast of the city. Also, Japanese troops have broken into Pingnan.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Occur Between US and Yu Opinions</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Swedish Aftonbladet correspondent in Washington, the United States is now asking Chiang Kai-shek to actively participate in the war. Nelson, the US special envoy to Chongqing, reported to Roosevelt after returning to the country that the Japanese army's offensive was still continuing to threaten Chongqing. The US air force stationed in Chongqing had been driven out, and the bases in Hengyang, Linglu, Lishui, and Yushan had been lost. Under this war situation, there is complete opposition in opinions between the heads of the US military and Chiang. The US side, in view of the need to defend various important air force bases, hopes to train the Yu army, but Chiang believes that the United States should defend it with its own troops. On the one hand, Chiang's most elite troops are deployed in the northern border area to deal with the communist army, while the US military believes that the Yu army has millions of troops, and there is no need to send US troops to China at this time. Stilwell proposed building the Chongqing army to participate in the Burma campaign, but Chiang also opposed this, but only allowed him to train several divisions of the Yu army. Because the United States would urge Chiang to reorganize the Yu army and strive to improve relations with the Soviet Union and negotiate with Yan'an, Chiang allowed foreign reporters to visit North China and Yan'an, and began negotiations with the Soviet Union. It is reported that Chiang has agreed to the proposal to reorganize the economy in order to curb currency inflation. The Yu side has proposed to the United States to build air force bases again in the areas under the rule of Chongqing. It is also reported that the Yu side advocates adopting a formal exchange rate of one US dollar to 20 yuan of legal tender.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Air Defense Equipment in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Guangzhou Air Defense Command has recently strengthened various fire-fighting equipment in various districts and has also established close contact with various Baojia districts in the city. It has begun dispatching personnel to investigate sturdy buildings in various districts of the city to be prepared as air-raid shelters for citizens. It is also conducting a detailed investigation of abandoned areas throughout the city to build air-raid trenches and has selected prosperous areas in the city to build additional air-raid walls.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices in Beijing After Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>Earnestly Hope Authorities Will Devise Countermeasures Soon Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the prices of various commodities in Beijing are showing a rising trend. Among them, vegetables and western cotton products are particularly in short supply and expensive. This situation, and its impact, is of great importance to the future of people's livelihood. The root cause is nothing more than the recent increase in the cost of train tickets and other transportation services, which has caused prices to rise across the board, affecting the costs of small-scale peddlers. On the other hand, unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the opportune time to once again employ their tricks, raising prices as usual. Moreover, with the current season deepening and the weather turning cold, the sales of cotton products and other items are increasing daily, providing an excellent opportunity for them to raise prices. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that the relevant authorities will devise countermeasures as soon as possible, to both increase the supply of goods and urgently restrain unscrupulous merchants from raising prices, taking both fundamental and symptomatic measures to stabilize commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Prepares for Winter Offensive</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - Although the Soviet military authorities have not announced the movements of Soviet troops on the Balkan front, especially within the former territory of Yugoslavia, the entire Eastern Front has entered a state of lull. According to a report by the United Press in London, military experts here believe that the Soviet army on eleven fronts will begin to regroup in preparation for a winter offensive. Thus, the Soviet army is thought to be entering preparations for a winter offensive.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Army Under Soviet Command</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Sofia dispatch: The Bulgarian Ministry of War has announced that the Bulgarian government, at the request of the Soviet High Command, has decided to incorporate the Bulgarian army into the Soviet Third Ukrainian Front.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Foreign Troops Participate in Western European Operations</h3>
<p>The Siegfried Line Defense Intensifies Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: After suffering heavy losses on the western border of Germany and in central Holland, the anti-Axis forces are now deploying more foreign troops in those areas. Canadian troops are responsible for attacking fortresses along the coast, while French, Belgian, and Dutch troop formations are fighting in other areas of the Western Front in Germany. Even Chinese and Czech soldiers have been integrated into the anti-Axis forces. According to reliable sources, conscription preparations for French men aged from 1897 to 1926 have been completed, and Holland has also begun recruitment measures. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - At the time of the annihilation of the British First Airborne Division near Arnhem in central Holland, it was anticipated that the anti-Axis forces would launch a major offensive in other areas. Now, a major offensive has indeed begun in the Aachen area on the German-Belgian border, with the intention of a frontal assault on the Siegfried Line. It is reported that the anti-Axis forces in the Aachen area have a considerable number of bombers, and the main force seems to be the British First Army, advancing continuously over an area of approximately six kilometers wide. At the same time, the American Third Army in the Belfort area of northeastern France is also preparing a general offensive. If so, the airborne attack near Arnhem can be regarded as the first stage of the decisive battle on the Western Front, and the ongoing attacks in the Aachen and Belfort areas can be regarded as the second stage. German counterattacks are also extremely fierce, so the two armies are in a stalemate on the Siegfried Line, and the war may turn into a long-term war. In this situation, the problem of winter supplies will not allow the anti-Axis forces to be optimistic about the future of the war, and Eisenhower's headquarters may also be well aware of this.</p>
<h3>New German Troops Deployed to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting broke out again in the Aachen area on the 2nd. Under the cover of armored units and heavy artillery, the anti-Axis forces captured the small village of Würselen, eight kilometers north of Aachen. The German army, which is defending the Rhineland industrial area, is launching a very fierce counterattack against this, and is continuously concentrating new weapons and personnel to attack in that direction. The German command announced that the German army on the Lower Rhine and the Ur River areas still maintains its advantage from the previous days, repelling the British counterattack. A fierce armored battle also took place in the area south of Nijmegen, but the front line did not change significantly. The fighting within Holland is temporarily suspended due to flooding. The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 3rd that Calais, on the Dover coast, has fallen.</p>
<h3>German Deputy Minister of Propaganda Declares Determination to Annihilate the Enemy in Speech</h3>
<p>Buckingham Palace Hit by Missiles Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Roman, delivered a speech at a rally to boost morale in a major industrial city on the western border, stating that the dispersed German forces on the broad front of the current mobile warfare on the Western Front have been concentrated, and a new front line can be established, and efforts will be made to strengthen the western fortresses. Although the enemy has regained the superior position of the German army in France, the British and American armies have many difficulties and cannot achieve victory. The railway facilities in Western Europe were completely destroyed by the German army during the retreat. The German command must crush the enemy air force. If Britain believes that the German loss of the base for launching cruise missiles in France will eliminate the British air threat, this is completely wrong. The German command has never imagined that it could change the war situation solely with new weapons, but strengthening Germany's scientific forces and using the inherent ability of the world's most outstanding German scientists to overcome the country's difficulties is what should be focused on. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German army's new weapons attacks are still continuing. According to London news, the gardens of Buckingham Palace suffered considerable damage on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Signs Post-War Bill</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports from Washington: President Roosevelt signed several bills yesterday to restore the US armaments industry to its peacetime state after the end of the war. These bills include the legal transfer of existing factories and their raw material inventories to private enterprises. The bills also prohibit soldiers from retaining their weapons to prevent unemployment.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Envoys Visit Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report: Gu Weijun, the chief representative of Chongqing attending the British-American-Chongqing talks, Wei Daoming, the ambassador to the United States, Shang Zhen, the head of the military delegation, and others, accompanied by the Undersecretary of State of the United States, visited Roosevelt at the White House on the 3rd, and the meeting lasted about ten minutes. The purpose of the visit by the Chongqing representatives and the content of the meeting have not been released.</p>
<h3>British and Soviet Trade Union Leaders to Hold Meetings</h3>
<p>Berne, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports from the British capital: Six Soviet trade union leaders, led by Kuznetsov, chairman of the Soviet Trade Union League, have arrived in London. They will hold several meetings with British trade union leaders.</p>
<h3>Chiang and Hurley Discuss Concerns About China's Reddening</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing report, Hurley, the US military envoy stationed in Chongqing, recently held six meetings with Chiang Kai-shek. It is reported that Chiang told Hurley at the time that the Chongqing military authorities have deployed a large army in the northwest for the past six years to prevent the rebellion of the Chinese Communists in the border areas, and only now can they resist both the Communists and continue to resist Japan. If Britain and the United States ignore the current crisis in China, it is feared that the result of China's resistance against Japan will be the complete reddening of mainland China. In response, Hurley replied that the United States is not sitting idly by in the face of the crisis in Chongqing, but there is no other way to provide assistance at present except for airlift from India and Burma. Therefore, the United States' strategy on mainland China in the future will fundamentally change depending on the development of the Japanese army's operations.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Breakdown of the Bombay Talks</h3>
<p>Gandhi Issues Statement Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The main reason for the breakdown of the Bombay talks appears to be the issue of establishing an independent Muslim state, due to differences on the proposal to hold a national referendum. According to a Bombay dispatch, Gandhi issued a statement when he met with reporters on the 3rd, saying that the reason for the breakdown of the talks was that he did not agree with Jinnah's desire to immediately recognize the Northwest Frontier as a completely independent Muslim state. He also expressed hope that recognition would be obtained without first going through the procedures of a national referendum, but he was unable at that time to agree, in his personal capacity or any other capacity, to the proposal of millions of state residents regarding their own fate and future. Gandhi also argued that India should break away from British rule and gain freedom before changing the map, while Jinnah advocated immediate recognition of the partition of India. In addition, regarding the relationship between the Muslim state and the Hindu state, Gandhi hoped that the two countries would implement common policies so that they could coordinate with each other in defense and transportation in addition to administration, as this would not only benefit both countries but also not conflict with the sovereignty of both countries. In short, our talks were held in the position of friends, and I hope we can hold talks again.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>The rice purchase period is approaching. What reforms have been made to this year's purchase policy compared to last year? I heard that the policy of "Inland Center-ism" has been confirmed. Is this true?</p>
<h3>Inland Center-ism</h3>
<p>Answer: Although there were several reasons for the unsuccessful work last year, the most important reason was that the purchase began too late. In light of last year's valuable experience, the new office was completed in September this year, and the system of starting purchases simultaneously upon its inauguration has been completed. Therefore, at least in this respect, last year's mistakes will not be repeated. Preparations were completed approximately two months earlier than last year. We express our deep gratitude for the diligent assistance of the relevant Chinese and Japanese military and official authorities in various locations. Regarding the purchase organization and methods, it is true, as reported, that we are adopting a new policy of "Inland Center-ism." First, regarding the organization, we are establishing regional offices in each major purchase stronghold. These offices will serve as the center, concentrating the direct and indirect purchase power of various locations. They will be granted stronger authority and greater responsibility than last year, to fully leverage regional flexibility in purchasing. Second, regarding the price policy, we have also given special consideration to adapting to the organization to fully leverage its flexibility. Originally, when starting purchases, we published a public price and implemented purchases based on this standard. Unfortunately, the publicly set maximum price became the minimum price. As a result, we created a cocoon around ourselves and suffered from the price policy we had set. We have now given great consideration to this point and are adopting a flexible price policy that adapts to changes without changing its essence. However, this does not mean adopting a directionless price policy that follows the black market. A firm countermeasure has been established, but we will try our best to prevent unscrupulous merchants from exploiting this countermeasure. Third, regarding funds, we plan to fully respect inland flexibility. Each region has designated banks and designated merchants, with the offices as the center, so that funds can be utilized in a timely and appropriate manner. Methods to prevent the misuse of funds have also been prepared, and strict measures will be taken to prohibit funds from being used for improper purposes. As the inauguration period begins, the preparation of funds in various regions is almost complete, and purchasing merchants will not encounter financial difficulties when starting purchases. In short, based on last year's experience, considerable reforms have indeed been implemented in terms of preparatory work. Purchasing work is about to begin, and we wish it smooth success. However, one point must be clarified: the so-called "Inland Center-ism" is not "Inland Separatism." Shanghai and the inland are like the two wheels of a cart, and they should advance simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen communication with various regions. Therefore, we are reorganizing the headquarters and doing our utmost to provide as many conditions as possible that are beneficial to inland purchases from a national perspective. Question: How is the promulgation and implementation of the "Provisional Regulations for the Transportation and Sale of Rice and Grain in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" proceeding?</p>
<h3>Compliance with the New Regulations</h3>
<p>Answer: These regulations are more powerful than the transportation and sales management policies for other materials. From the perspective of the nature of the rice and grain issue, this is a natural trend. With the united cooperation of military, official, and civilian personnel, we sincerely hope that the spirit of these regulations can be thoroughly implemented. These regulations stipulate that those who obstruct the transportation and sale of rice and grain shall be punished with imprisonment of up to ten years and fines of up to one million yuan. However, those who are working for the Rice Control Committee must earnestly implement these provisions themselves, and we are confident that the relevant authorities will provide special assistance. Furthermore, prior to the promulgation of the transportation and sales management regulations, the abolition of the original Shanghai Rice and Grain Passport measures had been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan. Some people criticized this as effectively prohibiting the transportation of more than eight kilograms of rice into Shanghai, which is inappropriate. Now, as the purchasing period begins, allowing the transportation methods that were adopted as temporary measures in the past to continue would clearly hinder the smooth progress of inland purchasing work and create conditions favorable to smuggling. We are confident that the abolition of the old passport measures is the proper action to take. Question: Since this spring, the rice and grain issue has become the focus of public opinion. Public opinion has high expectations for the Rice Control Committee, and those involved in the Rice Control Committee also place great hopes on public opinion. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<h3>Humbly Accept Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Answer: We should humbly accept constructive public opinion that focuses on the overall situation. However, public opinion that only sees the trees and not the forest is not beneficial to the Rice Control Committee or to the public. Rice and grain are different from other materials and are most closely related to the lives of the people. Therefore, people are naturally particularly concerned about the control of rice and grain. We hope that it will be constructive and not just pessimistic. We hope that people will pay full attention to constructive efforts. The opinions we hope to hear are those that are issued from the position of enabling the Rice Control Committee to succeed in its purchases. Question: Mr. Bing Shang, chairman of the Wheat Control Committee, has stated the key to establishing a unified, coordinated, and forward-moving system for the various control committees for the purchase of agricultural products. This seems to be an important issue from an overall perspective. What are your thoughts? Answer: Indeed. For example, wheat and rice have different purchase periods. Therefore, issues such as the warehouse problem mentioned by Mr. Bing Shang are perfectly reasonable. In my opinion, it would naturally be best if the agricultural product purchase agencies could be unified. There are also many issues that require cooperation, all of which are very important. Current countermeasures, such as holding liaison meetings, etc., are hoped to be realized.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Question: What are your countermeasures regarding rice prices? Answer: The rice price issue ultimately boils down to the purchase issue and the distribution issue. If purchases can be successful, distribution can be strengthened. If distribution can be strengthened, the black market can be reduced. Now is the purchase period, which is also the time to practice the simple and clear theory that the rice price is the purchase issue. Furthermore, the rice price issue is extremely difficult to resolve solely through rice price countermeasures. Therefore, we sincerely hope to implement a comprehensive price stabilization policy. Question: Finally? Answer: At the inaugural meeting of the Jiangsu Office of the Rice Control Committee, I said the following words, and I will repeat them once again: We constantly keep the following four points in mind as we move forward with rice and grain control: ○ We purchase the rice and grain necessary in wartime to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. ○ We should treat the farmers' hard-earned crops with gratitude. ○ We, in view of rice and grain being the driving force of all material wealth, should always remember our heavy responsibility and honor. ○ We should carry out our work without selfishness and realize the true face of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Although the above is extremely abstract, we are willing to move forward to fulfill our responsibilities under this belief. (翔: Translated from the Continental New Daily, October 4th)</p>

<h3>Advisory Council Recommends City Government to Extend Rice Grain Movement to Allow Free Movement of Ten Stones or Less to Facilitate Rice Source</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Advisory Council held its eighth plenary meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. More than 20 committee members, including Yan Huiging, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and Wu Yunqi, attended. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government and heads of various bureaus and departments were invited to participate, and Mayor Chen also personally attended. Chairman Li Sihao first had Secretary-General Wu report on the establishment and work of the Municipal Tax Reorganization Committee, which was recently jointly organized by the Municipal Government and the Advisory Council. Next, Director of Finance Yuan Houzhi reported on the process of reforming special taxes, followed by Director Feng You of the Goods Distribution Office reporting on the current situation of rice distribution for civil consumption in the city. Subsequently, the Standing Committee, Li Sihao and Chen Binhe, finished their reports, and then the date of public sale was announced in the newspaper to avoid the public traveling back and forth in vain and rising rice prices. The Goods Distribution Office has replied that it will follow this advice and make improvements as much as possible. ○ Based on the resolution of the seventh meeting of the council, specialized committees on public utilities, public works, health, and small groups have been established. Letters have been sent to each committee member recommending specialized talent and requesting that each committee member widely seek recommendations and reply to the council, requesting the municipal government to appoint them. ○ The council's proposal that rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office should be handed over to the Goods Distribution Office for use by the citizens of the city has been approved by the municipal government. ○ The Standing Committee hosted the administrative inspectors of the first and second districts of the city and the magistrates of the seven counties. ○ The Standing Committee exchanged views with leaders from various sectors of the Allied nations on improving the municipal administration of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Five Important Proposals Approved</h3>
<p>Subsequently, five proposals were discussed: ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to petition the Central Government to restore the free transportation of civil consumption rice of ten stones or less in the city and to negotiate with the Rice Control Committee to find ways to facilitate the source of rice was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to petition the Central Government regarding the special distribution of rice to military police, civil servants, and civil consumption rice in the city, that the Shanghai Municipal Government and civil organizations should jointly establish a Shanghai Grain Public Warehouse to purchase rice from various places, was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to the Municipal Government to instruct the Finance Bureau to submit a monthly statement of actual income and expenditure of the city for the Council to keep confidential as a reference for research and improvement of finance was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal for actively evacuating the population of Shanghai was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for handling. ○ A proposal to crack down on railway porters arbitrarily extorting money was approved and sent to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Construction and the Central China Railway Company for strict crackdown. In the end, a temporary motion was made to request the local police authorities in the city not to enforce the rule that more than eight kilograms of rice and grain cannot be freely moved within the blockade. Deputy Director Lu of the Police Bureau replied that there was no restriction on citizens transporting rice within the city blockade, but those entering the blockade from outside the blockade should also be carefully enforced in order to secure food for the people.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Municipal Government Requesting Extension of Rice Limit</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, the amount of rice allocated to households in this city is insufficient, and most of it relies on peddlers. Therefore, the rise and fall of rice prices in this city directly affects people's livelihood. This council, representing public opinion, has repeatedly sent letters to your government in the case of not being afraid of being tedious. According to the Rice Control Committee's Rice Circulation Letter No. 2, after the abolishment of the method of applying for and issuing passports for rice and grain entering the city, according to the instruction of the Executive Yuan, rice prices suddenly increased. If the authorities cannot take effective measures, the livelihood problems of the people in this city will become more serious. This council hereby solemnly recommends that your government immediately telegraph the Executive Yuan, requesting that the method of free transportation of civil consumption rice of ten stones or less be restored, and to negotiate with the Rice Control Committee to find ways to facilitate the source of rice and grain to secure food for the people and stabilize rice prices. Please also notify the police bureau that, before the Executive Yuan decides to restore the free movement of rice and grain of ten stones or less, the crackdown on rice and grain movement should be temporarily carried out in accordance with the old rules to reassure people and maintain food for the people.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Evacuating the Population</h3>
<p>○ The Municipal Government, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, should issue a notice that any citizen who intends to leave Shanghai and return to their hometown may go to a designated place (preferably set up in several places) to register in detail the number of people, destination, residence permit number, and the number of pieces of luggage they are carrying. When transportation is available, it can be extended to Ningbo Station and various ports along the Yangtze River. ○ There should be restrictions on the registration period and the number of pieces of luggage. For example, those who register before a certain day may depart before a certain day, and those who register after a certain day may depart after a certain day. Each person should have a maximum of two pieces of luggage, each piece limited to a certain number of kilograms or cubic feet. ○ After the first phase of registration is completed, the Municipal Government should negotiate with the Central China Railway Company to determine a date for a special train to depart once. Tickets and luggage tickets should be sold by the Welfare Bureau together with the Central China Railway a day or two in advance, and fees should be charged strictly in accordance with the stipulated prices to prevent the occurrence of a black market. ○ After being registered and approved, citizens should report their household registration to the police station in charge before leaving Shanghai and ask the Baojia chief to provide a letter guaranteeing that the citizen will definitely not impersonate the name of returning home and secretly make a short trip, and soon secretly return to Shanghai. If such a situation occurs in the future, the Baojia chief should be responsible for reporting to the Welfare Bureau for strict punishment. ○ The Municipal Government and the Social Welfare Bureau should dispatch dozens of competent personnel, together with Central China Railway staff, to take care of and maintain order on the train.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Railway Porter Extortion</h3>
<p>It has been observed that in recent years, under the management of the Central China Railway Company on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, due to the wartime shortage of vehicles, it has been extremely difficult for passengers to purchase tickets. Any citizen who has traveled on these two lines can attest to this without the need for further elaboration. Recently, Central China Railway has implemented improved ticket sales methods and measures to crack down on black market tickets, which have been quite proactive, demonstrating the authorities' deliberate efforts to rectify railway administration and alleviate the hardships of passenger transport. However, the results have not yet been significant, and a group of porters has been added to the stations and trains. These porters wear black uniforms without any badges or numbers and specialize in extorting passengers, acting like wolves and tigers, demanding money in every possible way. According to what has been heard and seen in newspaper reports, the specific facts are roughly as follows: violating regulations, should be confiscated, otherwise they privately demand several thousand or several hundred yuan to settle the matter. Passengers who are timid fear causing further trouble and delaying their journey, so they have no choice but to bribe them, filling their insatiable greed. Even those who want to resist find it difficult to report them to their superiors because the porters' uniforms have no badges or numbers, and the passengers are crowded, so everyone dares to be angry but does not dare to speak out. ○ Under the aforementioned extortion situation, if anyone dares to resist being checked or refuses to pay an extra tip, they are often privately squeezed by three or four porters to a secluded place, such as a toilet, where they are beaten severely or stripped naked. As for the luggage and money they carry, being robbed of everything is naturally part of the deal. ○ All passengers carrying luggage, regardless of whether they are small vendors, are required to pay per item. For example, bringing a small package requires paying tens to hundreds of yuan, otherwise, the luggage may be cut to pieces with a knife. Such bad deeds occur on every train, without exception. It is understood that the current difficulty for passengers to purchase tickets and the widespread complaints are actually due to the shortage of coal and the reduction in the number of trains, which is not something that can be remedied by human effort. However, adding these porters, who are harmful and not beneficial, has never been seen to provide any service to passengers during their duties, but instead increases the various unexpected pressures on passengers. Although the Central China Railway authorities may have other intentions, it is not appropriate for outsiders to speculate. However, these obvious acts of misconduct must be reformed immediately to ensure the safety of travelers. Therefore, I dare to offer a few humble suggestions as follows: ○ In the current situation, Central China Railway porters only know how to extort and exploit passengers, and do little else. It seems that they can be quickly dismissed and disbanded. ○ If each train still needs to have porters to take care of passengers, then the uniforms should have clear names and numbers. ○ A large notice should be posted in each car, stating that only military police and conductors have the right to check tickets and luggage. Any other personnel, regardless of whether they are wearing uniforms, must not overstep their authority. If there is any deliberate violation, they can be reported to a designated location (such as the station master's office in the station or the conductor's office on the train). ○ More disciplined military police or police officers should be stationed at stations and on trains, and more senior railway staff should be dispatched to patrol at all times to stop illegal acts of violence. ○ If porters or other personnel are found to have the aforementioned violations again, they should be severely punished as a warning to troublemakers.</p>
<h3>### National Day Charity Film Performance by the New United Association</h3>
<p>Pre-sale of tickets to avoid crowding The Shanghai News United Association, in order to solemnly commemorate National Day and in view of the lack of funds for student aid and social welfare undertakings, has specially arranged a grand celebration charity performance. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will all be used for charitable purposes. The program includes three types: Peking Opera, Film, and Drama. Among them, the film convention will be held at 8 pm on the 10th at the Grand Cathay Theatre. The film has been decided as China Film's new film [Bitter Child's Paradise]. Ticket prices are divided into Honorary Seats (balcony) 500 yuan, Charity Seats (mezzanine) 300 yuan, and Public Welfare Seats (downstairs) 200 yuan. The association believes that the new film is being released for the first time, and it is also a holiday. At the same time, the cost is not high, and it is beneficial, so there will be no shortage of people. In order to avoid crowding when buying tickets, pre-sale will start at the Grand Cathay today at 10 am. It is hoped that people will be widely introduced to help it succeed, and impoverished children will benefit even more. At the same time, in order to popularize it, the association has decided to sell tickets for the charity performance of the drama (Sea Burial), which will be held at the Lyceum Theatre at 7:30 pm on the 11th, at half the current price of the theatre. It is hoped that readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Uniform Fare for Commercial Tricycles</h3>
<p>In order to unify the fares for commercial tricycles, the Municipal Public Works Bureau convened a meeting on the 23rd of last month with 18 commercial tricycle dealers in the city, including Xiang Sheng, to discuss how to unify the fares for the entire city. The dealers were asked to fill out reports on rent and cost. After detailed and rigorous review and negotiation with the dealers, it was agreed that the fares for commercial tricycles in the city would be as follows: 100 yuan for a double seat for every half hour, with an additional 20 yuan for every five minutes exceeding, 70 yuan for a single seat for every half hour, with an additional 12 yuan for every five minutes exceeding. The daily rent for a double seat is 600 yuan, and the daily rent for a single seat is 450 yuan, unified throughout the city. If a driver extorts any extra fees, citizens can immediately report to the Public Works Bureau or the Police Bureau, and they will be punished according to the Measures for Punishing Drivers of Commercial Tricycles for Extorting Liquor Money. The main points are recorded as follows: Article 3: If it is a first offense, in addition to recovering the overcharged fare, the driver's license will be detained for five days, and the company's vehicle or vehicle license plate will be detained for five days. Article 4: If the offender does not repent after a second offense, in addition to recovering the overcharged fare, their driver's license will be revoked, and the company's vehicle license plate will be revoked. Article 5: If it is discovered that more than three drivers in each commercial tricycle company have extorted liquor money, indicating that the company's management is inadequate, the company will be suspended from business for three to ten days. Article 8: The above measures will be implemented separately by the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>Crime Prevention Section Strictly Arrests Pickpockets</h3>
<p>The city police bureau has previously launched a campaign to eliminate pickpocketing, mobilizing police officers and Baojia residents to cooperate and implement investigations. Recently, pickpocketing has become active again. In order to prevent and crack down on pickpocketing, the Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Office has dispatched more police officers to conduct strict investigations, and has also investigated those who have previously committed pickpocketing and have been released, in order to thoroughly eliminate it.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Western Music Program at the Sino-Western Music Convention</h3>
<p>Since the performance of Chinese music on the 2nd and 3rd of the Sino-Western Music Convention, public opinion has been unanimous in its praise. Today, the entire program is Western music, with Mr. Li Weining and Mr. Chen Hong serving as consultants, and Mr. Liang Yueyin and Mr. Huang Yuanjun as the mainstays. Although Shanghai has not lacked concerts in recent years, solo performances are smaller in scale. This time, with the charity performance to help students, all parties have enthusiastically supported it, and more than 100 famous musicians have been mobilized, which is an unprecedented event. In addition to the 100-person chorus, famous musicians such as Ma Si-hong, Pan Mei-bo, Ge Chao-she, Ji Han-wen, Huang Yuan-yin, and Huang Yong-xi will all contribute their unique skills and play their works. Famous songs such as "Sea Rhyme," "Homesickness," and "Mountain in the Misty Void" will all be performed. It is now heard that in addition to the female three-part chorus, a male four-part chorus has been added, and the pre-sale of tickets is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case of Rice Administration Staff Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 9th Rong Huiren, an office clerk in the Second Section of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Rice Administration, was entrusted by Bao Mingxiang, a Wuxi merchant, on June 20th of this year to transport 60 dan of rice from Henglin to Shanghai. Bao borrowed six citizen certificates from relatives and friends and entrusted Rong to obtain the Certificate for Moving Rice In from the Third Section of the Transportation Department of the Rice Administration. Rong did manage to obtain six Certificates for Moving In and handed them over to Bao Mingxiang. Rong did not receive any reward from Bao on this occasion. On July 9th, Bao had another 180 dan of rice that he intended to transport from Henglin to Shanghai and still entrusted Rong to find a way to borrow them, and agreed that whoever borrowed the citizen certificates would be rewarded with the sale of one dan of cheap rice. (The so-called cheap rice was about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan cheaper than the black market price in the city.) However, Rong only borrowed one citizen certificate, and the remaining 17 certificates were borrowed from colleagues by Rong through Section Chief Chen Yuan, and Chen was entrusted to explain to the colleagues that after the rice arrived in Shanghai, each person would also be able to purchase one dan of cheap rice. On July 10th, Rong handed the 18 Certificates for Moving In to Bao Mingxiang, and Bao transported 180 dan of community rice, totaling 130 bags, to Shanghai on July 15th. On July 15th, 38 bags were sold to the General Affairs Section of the Rice Administration and 91 bags were sold to the Central Trust Bureau at a price of 10,500 yuan per dan, and another 20,000 yuan was given to Rong as a subsidy for transportation expenses. Subsequently, the Municipal Economic Security Office learned of this and arrested Rong and the other two and sent them to the Procuratorate for investigation. The defendants all confessed. It was found that if more than 10 dan of rice were transported, the Rice Administration could purchase 30% at the official price. Rong Huiren, greedy for reward, borrowed 18 citizen certificates on behalf of Bao and fraudulently obtained transportation certificates, dividing 180 dan of rice into smaller quantities to avoid requisition. As a public official intending to obtain illegal benefits, he violated Article 214 of the Criminal Law. Chen Yuan borrowed the citizen certificates on behalf of others, knowing the situation but still participating in the fraud, and should be treated as a joint offender. Bao Mingxiang should also be punished in accordance with Article 216 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, Prosecutor Sun Jiajie of the District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 320, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case was opened for trial by the District Court last month. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Mi continued the trial in the Criminal Court. Each defendant only stated that borrowing citizen certificates to apply for rice transportation certificates was a common occurrence within the Rice Administration and could not be considered fraud. They also stated that according to what Yuan Ludeng, the former chairman of the Rice Administration, said in the Rice Administration's journal, it was a commercial autonomous group, so they were not public officials and could not be treated as public officials for the purpose of punishment. The court determined that the facts of the case were clear and scheduled the official sentencing for the morning of the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Drill to Be Held This Afternoon at 1 PM</h3>
<p>The city's air defense headquarters has scheduled a test of the alarm siren between 1:00 PM and 1:30 PM today (the 5th). Citizens are requested not to mistake this for an air raid alarm.</p>
<h3>Standardized Design for Alarm Flags</h3>
<p>The relevant authorities in the city's air defense are actively designing standardized alarm flags for the Chinese and Japanese self-alert outposts. It is heard that the city needs more than 16,000 of these flags. The format is stipulated as triangular, and when used, they will be divided into three colors: green, red, and yellow. During alarm training, yellow will be used. During a formal alert or a warning alert, green will be used. During an air raid alert, red will be used.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes at the Shanghai Income Tax Bureau</h3>

<h3>Revised Ferry Schedule for Municipal Ferries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ferry Company resumed operations on the 15th and 18th of last month. Because it is the busy farming season, there are fewer passengers coming and going. In order to save coal, the company has recently reduced the number of ferries to one, operating between Shanghai and Gaoqiao. The revised schedule is recorded as follows: Shanghai Departure Qingning Temple Departure Donggou Departure Gaoqiao Arrival 10:00 11:10 11:30 12:30 4:00 5:10 5:30 6:30 Gaoqiao Departure Donggou Departure Qingning Temple Departure Shanghai Arrival 7:00 8:00 8:20 9:30 1:00 2:00 2:20 3:30</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Nanjing Xingye Bank Shanghai Branch</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Nanjing Xingye Bank Shanghai Branch opened. From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Ningbo Road was bustling with traffic, and the house was full of congratulatory guests. More than 1,000 guests from all walks of life attended, including Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Tang Taomin, Wu Zhenxiu, Ye Fuxiao, Zhu Boquan, Wu Yunqi, Dai Ailu, Shao Shuhua, Sun Henei, Zhang Weiru, Jin Zongcheng, Zhou Zuomin, Lu Chongzhi, Xu Jianping, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Gu Ru, Zhang Deqin, Xu Maotang, Li Jinghan, Sun Yaodong, Xia Zongde, Sun Zhongli, Wang Xiaoshui, Zhu Puzhi, Ye Xuesong, Ji Yangzhou, Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Huang Jingqi, and Lu Feng.

<h3>First Welfare Football Match Ended Unhappily Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangdong Business Community Buys Ball for One Million Yuan The first shot of this year's welfare football match, Donghua vs. Overseas Chinese Federation, was held at the Huangpi Road Racecourse Stadium at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, with no less than 10,000 people. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare performed the opening kick ceremony. During the match, Mrs. Ye Xuesong, Director of the Public Works Bureau, auctioned a charity ball, which was bought by Yu Zhijing, the representative of the Guangdong business community, for one million yuan, setting a new record for the auction of charity balls at the opening kick-off match. All proceeds from this match will be used to fund Guangdong charitable organizations in Shanghai. It is a pity that the match ended unhappily 15 minutes before the end, as the Overseas Chinese Federation team quietly left the field due to dissatisfaction with the referee's decision, resulting in no result and a great disappointment.</p>
<h3>Minor Conflicts Continue the Match</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the autumn weather was clear and refreshing. At 5:00 PM, Minister Ding kicked off the match, and the match began immediately. Donghua was initially in a position against the wind, so the ball often hovered in the Donghua area. The Overseas Chinese Federation had a strong team this season due to the participation of three Tianjin tigers. Bao Jie and Bama repeatedly had opportunities to shoot, but failed to score due to their wild feet. Unexpectedly, 20 minutes before the end of the first half, a minor conflict broke out between the two teams due to a misunderstanding. Mai Nidi, the captain of the Overseas Chinese Federation team, immediately ordered all team members to leave the field, unwilling to continue the match, causing the match to stop. Fortunately, after persuasion from Minister Xi and others, they re-entered the field to continue the match. Before long, Donghua's Dai Lin, with the help of Jia Youliang, broke the record, and Donghua took the lead with one to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3>Mai Nidi Leads the Whole Team to Leave the Field</h3>
<p>After the break, the charity ball was auctioned, and the match resumed. In less than five minutes, Donghua's Li Yao scored again, making it two to zero. The Overseas Chinese Federation stepped up its counterattack at this time, and as a result, Mama, Bao Jie, and Yatuomali scored three goals successively in 20 minutes, taking the lead with three to two. At this time, the performances of both sides were tense. Then, the Overseas Chinese Federation's guard committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was taken by Sun Jinshun. Because Mai Nidi moved his body before the referee blew the whistle, referee He Chunhui ordered a retake. At this time, Mai Nidi, the captain of the Overseas Chinese Federation team, again ordered all team members to leave the field, causing the match to stop again. Although various parties mediated, Mai still refused to budge. It is understood that players must absolutely obey the referee during the match. If there is any dissatisfaction, they must file a protest after the match. This can be said to be the spirit of sportsmanship. It is regrettable that Mai repeatedly used leaving the field as a threat. Fortunately, the audience was well-behaved and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament Opens Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The Shenbao Cup basketball league will be held at 6:30 PM on Friday (the 6th) at the gymnasium of the Japanese Army Dormitory across from the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse.

<h3>Offering Opportunities to Prepare for Charity Tennis Match</h3>

<h3>Revenue and Expenditure Report for Charity Screening of [Silver Sea Millennium]</h3>

<h3>Recent Youth (1)</h3>
<p>The next day's news was filled with the story of the nine heroic warriors, the gods of war.  Longfu thought of last night's dream and stared intently at the real person's photograph.  In his middle school days, when taking exams, the real person would often gently close his lips and stare straight ahead. After this expression, the real person would reveal his neatly aligned white teeth and smile slightly.</p>
<p>On the dry newspaper, a sound emerged; it was Longfu's tears, dripping onto the paper.</p>
<p>His eyes gazed at the photograph of the god of war for a moment. (Hey, who is this face?)</p>
<p>He recalled the people he had met at the Futian Inn. There were too many naval personnel, so there were many with the same name and surname, as well as similar appearances. Lieutenant Colonel Tangqian, Major Xintian—ah, he remembered, the lieutenant who loved to joke the most at the time was surnamed Tangqian. The lieutenant who led the tour of the submarine school was surnamed Xintian. Although it was impossible to fully recall the face from a single meeting, he felt as if he had seen their faces somewhere before.</p>
<p>(If the officers at that time were this group of people...)</p>
<p>Longfu was filled with boundless gratitude. Therefore, Longfu felt extremely regretful, why didn't he ask for a business card at the time, to remember their names and surnames firmly?</p>
<p>(No, even if it's not that group of people, as long as they are people who jointly performed this heroic feat with the real person, they are all immensely connected to me.)</p>
<p>He heard the radio broadcast announcing the promotion to colonel and learned about the background of the warriors, as well as the spirit of willingly embracing death, and admired them even more. Holding soda and chocolate, there was truly a sense of boundless freedom—whoever this young officer was who said these words, it was enough to represent the unwavering and righteous spirit of the nine war gods.</p>
<p>(Definitely not temporary courage. If it weren't for a persistent, death-defying determination, this state of mind would not be possible.)</p>
<p>Longfu imagined a room on an aircraft carrier in his mind, with people ready to set off, displaying joyful expressions. The scene of four officers quietly grinding ink, gathered together to write their wills, was also repeatedly reflected in Longfu's mind.</p>
<p>Decisive action avoids ghosts and spirits!</p>
<p>Naval Lieutenant Makoto Tani</p>
<p>Longfu stared intently at the traces of his confidant's handwriting that appeared in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(These two sentences were what the real person never stopped saying in his middle school days. This was originally a catchphrase of Colonel Kikuchi...)</p>
<p>It was as if he was vividly appearing before him again, this real person in a gray sailor uniform, a middle school student. He also seemed to see him gritting his teeth and tanning his back in Tianbao-de-hama. At the same time, there floated in his mind the earlier image of him clinging tightly to the iron bar at Yawata Elementary School. A small soul, actually accomplishing such great deeds—(148)</p>
<h3>Grandson's Full Month Celebration: Relatives and Friends Contribute Gifts to Charity</h3>
<p>On the 2nd of the month, Mr. Li Guangyao's grandson celebrated his full month. Mr. Guangyao, mindful of the difficult times, did not wish to be extravagant. Therefore, he took the gifts from relatives and friends, along with ornaments, totaling 80,000 yuan, and donated an additional 20,000 yuan himself, totaling 100,000 yuan, and allocated the entire amount to charity to benefit relatives and friends. This included a donation of 40,000 yuan to this newspaper's scholarship fund, and 10,000 yuan each to the local poverty relief fund, medical assistance fund, orphaned children's fund, Shanghai Old People's Home, Holy Mother's Orphanage, and Yangjingbang Holy Mother's Orphanage. Mr. Li's dedication to public welfare is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Charity Mooncake Sale Ends</h3>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company initially aimed to sell mooncakes for charity, with a target of 200,000 yuan, which was quickly sold out as scheduled, with 100,000 yuan each going to the Shen and Xin newspapers for scholarships and poverty relief. Subsequently, an anonymous gentleman purchased ten mooncakes called "[Peaceful Years]" for charity, totaling 100,000 yuan, and the Xin Yi Enterprise Company purchased one mooncake called "[Three Pools Mirroring the Moon]" for 6,000 yuan, totaling 106,000 yuan. 20,000 yuan was donated to the Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, and 86,000 yuan to this newspaper's Scholarship Fund and Poverty Relief Fund. Thank you received. The Guanshengyuan charity mooncake sale has now come to a successful conclusion.</p>
