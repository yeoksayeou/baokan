<h3>談歐局</h3>
<p>問：最近歐洲戰局的發展，一般很替德國擔憂。但是，依照目前戰事的情勢觀察，戰略上對於德國還是有利？還是不利？　　答：從局部來說，德國當然稍有不利；但從全般的戰術上來說，未必是不利。第一，反軸心國對德作戰的目標，是在利用其豐富的人與物兩種資源，以消耗德國的實力；然而德國爲對付反軸心軍的此種戰術，所以不論在東部戰綫，北法戰綫，以及在意大利巴爾幹戰綫，都作有計劃的撤退，避免無謂的犧牲，以保全人力和物力。所以在這一點上，反軸心國的戰略是失敗的。第二，德國在各地作有計劃的撤退後，其外廓防衛綫可以縮短三分之一以上，而集中兵力於內防衛綫；同時國內又可增加二百萬的軍隊分佈各戰綫，內防衛綫更可因而增強。反之，反軸心軍方面，不但是因戰綫過長使作戰不便，並且在聯絡運輸方面，亦感覺到極端的困難·第三，反軸心國戰綫延長，德國戰綫縮短，正足以證明雙方的有利條件，反軸心軍欲以不利的情勢，攻擊德國軍隊，事實上確有困難；益以九十兩月內，北海方面正是大霧時節，空軍失去效能，所以英美軍隊不論在軍事上，地理上，天時氣候上，都遭遇到困難的環境，形成進退維谷之勢。　　問：那末，除了軍事以外，其他決戰勝負的要素是什麼呢？　　答：那不外是國際關係，國內的政治指導，以及國民的精神力。　　問：試問目前歐洲的國際情勢，是否對德國有利？　　答：德國在歐洲的地位，正處在英美和蘇聯之間第三者的有利地位。蘇聯和英美的關係，不論在軍事上，政治上，以及經濟上，都暴露着無限的矛盾，這在世界各國都已共認；而戰事愈是進展，則英美蘇的矛盾愈是暴露明顯。第一，今且不論英美的資本主義與蘇聯的社會主義之間的根本矛盾；即就此次戰爭目的一點來說，則英美的作戰目的和蘇聯的作戰目的，已有根本的不同。英德之戰在前，而德蘇之戰在後；英德戰爭的時候，蘇聯和德國還保有互不侵犯條約的關係，嗣後更添上了經濟及其他各種條約，這可證明最初蘇聯根本還沒有與英美共同合夥的企圖；及至德蘇戰爭爆發，英美在旁鼓掌，希望德蘇同歸於盡，這又是表明英美並不希望蘇聯抬頭的絕大明證。今日英美蘇能站在共同戰綫上，這不過是偶然的配合；既然是偶然的，則雙方戰爭的目的亦決無相同之理，第二，在德蘇戰爭中，蘇聯向來保有獨自超然的性格，常予英美當頭棒喝，這不獨在宮事上如此，其他政治問題等亦然。如波蘭問題，南斯拉夫及意大利問題等實例，誠不勝枚舉。第三，不論在戰前，戰時，或戰後，英美爲自身利益計，在歐洲大陸上不能缺少一陸軍國家，但法國力不勝任，祇有德國纔可，所以將來歐洲大陸上，決不能缺少德國這一個國家的。因爲有了這種種原因，英美蘇三國雖均與德國處於戰爭狀態中，但考其實際，英美欲以德國力量來對付蘇聯，蘇聯欲以德國力量來牽制英美，結果最得其利者，唯德國一國。所以我們認爲德國在歐洲複雜的國際關係之中，實具有超然自主的最有利的地位。　　問：至於國內的政治指導力以及國民精神力，德國又是怎樣？　　答：德國於月前雖會發生謀刺希特勒總統事件，但是經過此次事件後，德國國內一切無恥政客及軍政叛徒，均被肅除一清，所以國內的團結力，更較前增強。至於德國國民的精神力的旺盛，以及德國民族的堅韌性的發揮無遺，更足以決定戰爭的趨勢。法國因爲缺乏旺盛的精神力，所以德國攻入未及數週，巳屈服簽訂城下之盟。而今日的德國國民，對於國家意識和民族精神的旺盛，自能克服目前的難關和危機；同時自從第一次歐戰以還，德國國民備嘗數十年凡爾賽和約悲痛的教訓，深知決不能再蹈第一次大戰和約的覆轍，所以他們除了作戰到底外，決不會再去選擇其他路綫的。因爲德國國民極深刻的認識着：德國若不獲取最後的勝利，將永遠不能立足於明日的世界。</p>
<h3>負思想戰重大任務組織中國新聞協會籌備就緒定廿五日在滬成立</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　世界戰局現已突入最後之決戰階段，新世界建設之成否，亦已面臨決定時期，故交戰各國無不傾舉全力，以期把握此最後時機，爭取勝利。我國上下鑒於大東亞戰局之演進，更感有擴大動員增強協力之必要。最近全國新聞界同仁，有感於總力戰下思想決戰之重要性，故亟欲根據戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要，團結全國新聞界，俾動員全體之總力，以擔負報道報國之使命。此事經各關係方面兩月來奔走籌劃，業已大體就緒，并經呈請宣傳部轉呈行政院，決定准予正式組織中國新聞協會，作爲中國新聞界之一大組織。於全體的立塲，以謀中國新聞界本身力量之集中，俾達成國家新聞之使命。現悉該協會已定本月二十五日在上海外灘工商聯誼會隆重舉行成立大會，國內各方對此均深爲期待。</p>
<h3>強化協力</h3>
<p>溯自吾國於去年一月九日向英美宣戰以來，國府當局爲強化協力戰爭，即着手從各部門整備戰時體制，在文化宣傳方面，去年六月十日最高國防會議通過戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要，以爲思想戰之最高準則，俾動員文化宣傳之總力，以擔負大東亞戰爭中文化戰思想戰之任務，自此綱要頒布以後，吾國文化宣傳界之組織，即逐漸趨於具體化，尤其新聞界更特別注意發揮公的性格，以增強力量，而爲總力戰下之一大主力。此次新聞協會之成立，乃爲中國新聞界更進一步加強團結集中總力之表現。不僅在現戰局下有集中全國新聞界力量，以展開思想決戰之偉大意義，即在吾國新聞史上言，此團結全國新聞界這一大組織，實亦爲劃時代之一頁。旣一掃過去自由主義時代之報業性格，且於今後中國新聞界公的發展上，意義亦至重大。況此次中國新聞協會之會員報社，包括整個和平地區，並有在華日本報社參加，故實爲中國新聞界人士與旅華盟邦報人空前之大團結。宣傳部爲協力新聞界之團結，對於新聞協會組織之促成，不遺餘力，特於本年七月間聘定新聞界有力人士郭秀峰許力求陳彬　尾坂與市金雄白秦墨哂伍麟祉等七人爲籌備委員，並於八月五日上午十時在滬華懋飯店舉行預備會，當由林部長報告創立中國新聞協會之意義，十一時起由郭氏任臨時主席，正式召開第一次籌備會議，着手準備工作，繼又於下午二時接開第二次籌備會議，至此一切必要準備，大體業已順利完成。成有會員報社亦經宣傳部審定及籌備委員會通過，故意料該協會成立以後，全國各地之該會會員各報社，必將在該會領導下，抱同一目標同一信念，傾其全力宣揚國策，暢達民意，以擔負決戰下之思想戰的偉大任務。</p>

<h3>培裡流等島激戰日守軍展開攻勢擊沉敵艦艇共達六十餘艘</h3>
<p>太平洋基地十九日中央社電　日·美空軍刻在帛琉羣島之培里琉·安格維爾及摩鹿加羣島之摩羅泰島展開激烈空戰。敵軍在有力機動部隊及新幾內亞基地之空軍掩獲下，不斷增強兵力，對該方面日軍展開攻勢，日軍之抵搞力至爲猛烈·據十七日晨舊金山電台廣播謂：帛琉君島之美軍，遭遇日軍頑強抵搞，不能如期進展，日軍於一日會猛烈反攻三次，茲將各方面戰況誌次：○培里琉島敵軍登陸部隊，在艦隊羣，重砲及飛機掩護下，增加新兵，以圖打開戰局，日軍反攻達二十四小時之久，整登陸軍無所進展，停滯於該島南端附近，十二日敵軍開始空襲登陸以來，日軍在該島周圍擊沉敵巡洋艦，驅驅艦，潛水艇，掃海艦等各一艘，登陸用舟艇六十餘艘，並擊毀敵戰車百五十餘輛，擊落敵機二十六架（內五架不確實），擊毀達七架，敵軍於十五日初度登陸之戰車百五十輛全被擊毀，受創甚重。○安格維爾，十二日敵於進攻培里琉島時，同時對該島加以砲擊及空襲，圖制壓日軍陣地，十四日晨以舟艇多艘，偵察東部海岸登陸地點，其登陸企圖至爲明顯。該島日軍早有防備，十七日九時許，敵軍在砲擊及空襲之掩護下，開始登陸，日軍勇猛反擊，致敵軍所蒙損害，與培里琉島相同。○摩羅泰島，敵軍於該島南端登陸，逐漸建設登陸地點，現似已着手建築機塲，該島日軍傾全力實行反攻，以阻止敵軍之進展建設工作。　　東京十九日中央社電　據南太平洋基地電，於培里琉島日本軍，自守備隊長以次官兵，至今仍然健在，對登陸敵軍加以猛烈反擊，致使敵軍陷於混亂狀態。十五日黃昏，該島西南地區，日軍戰車隊與步兵部隊協力，開始猛攻據守飛機塲之敵軍，使敵陣爲之動搖，同時砲兵部隊亦相機關砲攻擊，予敵損害極大，尤其西北地區敵軍，混亂程度更爲顯著。十七日之作戰中，日軍部隊戰力，皆集中於敵戰車部隊，敵戰車全被擊毀，該島南部日軍之連絡，雖時被遮斷，但亦可見日軍旗幟飛揚，戰門仍在繼續進展中。　　南太平洋日軍其基地十九日中央社電　敵軍十七日晨時以艦上砲火轟擊安格維爾島，同時並使在艦艇後方待機之登陸用舟艇三十餘艘一同出動，該島日守軍重砲陣地，當予敵第一批登陸舟艇以莫大打擊，使其潰退，敵軍雖受日軍猛烈砲火之攻擊，但竟終於九時在該島東岸登陸，於是日守軍勇猛迎擊，對之猛攻，迭作夜襲，是日自晨至暮，敵軍登陸者頗爲不少。聞擁有戰車二千輛。　　南太平洋基地十九日中央社電　哈爾馬黑拉島十六日會有敵小型機約百五十架來襲，經當地日軍迎擊擊落，擊毀其二十架。又與此相前後，於該島安灣亦有敵魚雷艇一艘停入，已被日軍陸上砲火擊沉。</p>
<h3>日軍沿江西進已迫近梧州肇慶北擊落美機兩架</h3>
<p>中國基地十八日中央社電　據日揁察機隊報告，日軍沿南江向西惟進，其一部已突破省境，直迫華南方面駐渝美空軍最前綫基地梧州，蓋日軍此次在西江沿岸突破峻險山岳地帶，迅速進擊，其一部則於攻陷桂省懷集後，通過信都南方（毛集西方八十公里），十七日晨直迫梧州東北方三十公里之地點。　　中國基地十八日中央社電　日俯衝轟炸機隊，十七日晨及黃昏，會再度轟炸於西江沿岸肇慶西北山地潰走中之渝軍約六百人。又日點門機隊十八日上下午兩度與來襲日戰塲附近之渝美Ｐ５１型機九架展開邀擊戰，結果於肇慶北方九十公里之上空，擊落其二架，日方則毫無損失。</p>
<h3>西江韶關連絡切斷</h3>
<p>日軍前綫十九日中央社電　日華南軍突入肇慶後，渝軍已陷不可收拾混亂狀態。蓋自今夏以來，渝軍誤算日軍意圖在打開粵漢綫，遂調派西江流域地區之第三十七集團軍主力北上，配於英德連江口戰綫防衛韶關，然日軍出其意測，自九日起開始進擊其弱點之西江流域地區，渝軍雖於肇慶方面擬阻日軍前進，然日軍自東南北三方面與溯航西江之海軍部隊緊急協力，布妥包圍地勢，積極進擊，瞬間佔領四會，高明，開平各要衝。十六日傍晚，擊滅第三十五集團　軍所約一萬之渝軍，突入肇慶，同時更以有力部隊急退德慶，封川方面陷於混亂狀態之渝軍，隨地將之擊滅。按肇慶乃西江沿岸之廣西省前衛戰略據點，故彼日軍攻略後，事實上渝軍西江流域南北兩軍已於日軍制壓下·渝軍以德慶，封川爲其前衛，連接梧州，構成戰綫，圖阻止日軍西進，遂拚命防衛，然由於日軍之制壓西江北岸，其與韶關之連擊悉被切斷，故渝軍第三十五集團軍約二師，完全喪失戰意，而陷潰亂狀態中。</p>
<h3>湘粵日軍距離漸近</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據合衆社駐偷訪員訊，日軍自湖南廣東兩省深入廣西，南北兩進攻部隊之距離，現已刻刻接近，日軍完成截斷中國大陸目的所留之間隙，目下僅有七十餘公里。此間隙即永明（桂林東方）及懷集（廣州西北有三十餘公里）間之間隙，桂林方面美軍苦心經營之航空基地，旣經破壞，日軍左翼部隊即可抵永明，其他日軍更可自廣東突破廣西省境佔領懷集，有七十公里之間隙，一經打開，日軍即得確保自南滿洲至南中國海之交通路綫，日本所計劃之東京至昭南島之直通鐵路，亦可因而成功，此項計劃，先以湘桂鐵路爲終點，攻略柳州，實屬必要，其次將與駐安南日軍取得聯絡，日軍爲達成此目的，更有克復五百五十公里距離之必要。</p>
<h3>桂林會戰即將展開</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據路透社重慶十八日訊，廣西省之戰況及桂林攻防戰綫之渝軍動向如下：日軍機甲部隊，由廣西平原向桂林猛進，但其先錄尚未接近防禦桂林之渝軍主力。渝軍爲應付此大會戰，已將桂林市民疏散完畢，至會戰之結果如何，則非今日所能預測者。日軍之裝備特別優秀，在開始攻擊之際，必以砲火戰車及飛機掩護，然渝軍亦具有利條件，即日軍之補給綫，現已延長至廣西省境之沿路渝軍，可以隨意展開遊擊戰，而桂林周圍復有巨大之高地山沿數百，此等高地，皆爲天然之堡壘，故將來之戰門，當爲極其悽慘之一戰也。</p>
<h3>日機重創贛州機塲</h3>
<p>南昌十九日中央社電　據日軍基地訊：日機十七日夜空襲渝軍第一綫基地贛州機塲，予以重創後，全機安返原防。</p>
<h3>日本第五次航空紀念日</h3>
<p>遠藤總局長發表談話　　東京十九日中央社電　日本軍需省航空兵器總局長官遠藤三郎中將，以二十日爲日本第五次航空紀念日，特接見記者團發表談話，其要旨如次：日本飛機在量上較之去年現在已增產二倍以上，其質更於世界上佔極優秀地位，與美軍Ｂ２９型機戰門，無論於白畫夜晚，均可從容將之擊落，飛機性能之提高，因可影響產量，但本年產量仍在去年二倍以上。</p>
<h3>航空功勞者舉行表彰式</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日運通省定於日本第五次航空日之二十日上午九時，舉行航空功勞者表彰式，對從事多年之航空職員特有功績者十五名，由運輸通信省授與勤勞獎章外，十六名由航空局長授與航空勤勞章。</p>
<h3>政院通過辦法決禁種罌粟</h3>

<h3>Discussion of the European Situation</h3>
<p>Q: Recently, there has been general concern for Germany regarding the development of the European war situation. However, observing the current state of the war, is the strategy advantageous or disadvantageous for Germany?</p>
<p>A: From a local perspective, Germany is certainly at a slight disadvantage. However, from a general tactical perspective, it may not be disadvantageous. First, the goal of the anti-Axis powers in their war against Germany is to use their abundant human and material resources to deplete Germany's strength. However, Germany, in order to counter this tactic of the anti-Axis forces, has been carrying out planned retreats on the Eastern Front, the Northern France Front, and the Italian Balkan Front, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices to preserve manpower and resources. Therefore, in this respect, the anti-Axis powers' strategy has failed. Second, after Germany has carried out planned retreats in various locations, its outer defense lines can be shortened by more than one-third, concentrating forces on the inner defense lines. At the same time, it can increase the number of troops in the country by two million and distribute them to various fronts, further strengthening the inner defense lines. Conversely, for the anti-Axis forces, not only is it inconvenient to operate due to the excessive length of the front lines, but they also experience extreme difficulties in communication and transportation. Third, the lengthening of the anti-Axis front lines and the shortening of the German front lines are enough to prove the advantageous conditions for both sides. It is indeed difficult for the anti-Axis forces to attack German troops under disadvantageous circumstances. Furthermore, during the months of September and October, the North Sea area is in the midst of heavy fog, which diminishes the effectiveness of the air force. Therefore, British and American troops encounter difficult conditions in terms of military affairs, geography, and the weather, creating a dilemma.</p>
<p>Q: Then, besides military factors, what other elements determine victory or defeat?</p>
<p>A: Those are nothing more than international relations, domestic political leadership, and the national spirit.</p>
<p>Q: May I ask if the current international situation in Europe is advantageous for Germany?</p>
<p>A: Germany's position in Europe is advantageously situated as a third party between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and America, whether in military, political, or economic terms, is fraught with endless contradictions, which is generally recognized by all countries in the world. And the more the war progresses, the more clearly the contradictions between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are exposed. First, let's not discuss the fundamental contradiction between British and American capitalism and Soviet socialism. Even in terms of the purpose of this war, the war aims of Britain and America and the war aims of the Soviet Union are fundamentally different. The war between Britain and Germany came before the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. At the time of the war between Britain and Germany, the Soviet Union and Germany still maintained a non-aggression treaty relationship, and later added economic and other treaties. This proves that initially the Soviet Union had no intention of joining forces with Britain and America. When the German-Soviet war broke out, Britain and America applauded from the sidelines, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would destroy each other. This is further clear evidence that Britain and America did not want the Soviet Union to rise. Today, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are able to stand on a common front, but this is only an accidental alignment. Since it is accidental, there is no reason why the war aims of both sides should be the same. Second, in the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has always maintained its own independent and detached character, often giving Britain and America a sudden blow. This is not only the case in military matters, but also in other political issues. Examples such as the Polish issue, Yugoslavia, and the Italian issue are too numerous to mention. Third, whether before, during, or after the war, Britain and America, for their own interests, cannot lack a land power in continental Europe. However, France is not up to the task, and only Germany can do it. Therefore, in the future, continental Europe will definitely not lack Germany as a country. Because of these various reasons, although Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are all at war with Germany, in reality, Britain and America want to use German power to deal with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union wants to use German power to restrain Britain and America. In the end, the one that benefits the most is Germany. Therefore, we believe that Germany has the most advantageous position of independence and autonomy in the complex international relations of Europe.</p>
<p>Q: As for domestic political leadership and national spirit, how is Germany doing?</p>
<p>A: Although Germany experienced an assassination attempt against President Hitler a month ago, after this incident, all shameless politicians and military and political traitors in Germany were completely purged, so the unity within the country has been strengthened even more than before. As for the vigorous national spirit of the German people, and the exhaustive demonstration of the tenacity of the German nation, it is enough to determine the trend of the war. France lacked a strong spirit, so Germany conquered it and signed a treaty of surrender within a few weeks. And today's German people, with their vigorous national consciousness and national spirit, will be able to overcome the current difficulties and crises. At the same time, since the First World War, the German people have tasted the painful lessons of the Treaty of Versailles for decades, and deeply know that they must not repeat the mistakes of the treaty of the First World War. Therefore, they will definitely not choose any other path besides fighting to the end. Because the German people deeply recognize that if Germany does not achieve final victory, it will never be able to stand in the world of tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The China News Association, Entrusted with the Important Task of Ideological Warfare, is Ready for Organization and Will be Established in Shanghai on the 25th</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency): The world war has now entered the final decisive stage, and the success or failure of the construction of the new world is also facing a decisive period. Therefore, all warring countries are exerting all their efforts to seize this final opportunity and strive for victory. Recognizing the evolution of the Greater East Asia War, our country, from top to bottom, feels the need to expand mobilization and enhance cooperation. Recently, colleagues in the national press, feeling the importance of the ideological decisive battle under the general war effort, are eager to unite the national press based on the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, so as to mobilize the total strength of the whole body to assume the mission of reporting and serving the country. After two months of running and planning by all relevant parties, this matter has been largely completed, and has been submitted to the Propaganda Department and then to the Executive Yuan, which decided to formally approve the organization of the China News Association as a major organization in the Chinese press. From the position of the whole body, it seeks to concentrate the power of the Chinese press itself, so as to achieve the mission of national news. It is now learned that the association has set the date for the grand inaugural meeting on the 25th of this month at the Bund Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association in Shanghai. All parties in the country have deep expectations for this.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Cooperation</h3>
<p>Since our country declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 last year, the National Government authorities have begun to prepare the wartime system in various departments in order to strengthen cooperative warfare. In terms of cultural propaganda, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy on June 10 last year as the highest guideline for ideological warfare, so as to mobilize the total strength of cultural propaganda to assume the task of cultural warfare and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War. Since the promulgation of this outline, the organization of our country's cultural propaganda circles has gradually become more concrete, especially the press has paid special attention to giving full play to the public character, so as to enhance strength and become a major main force under the general war effort. The establishment of the News Association this time is a manifestation of the further strengthening of unity and concentration of total strength in the Chinese press. It not only has the great significance of concentrating the strength of the national press under the current war situation to launch an ideological decisive battle, but also, in terms of the history of our country's press, this major organization that unites the national press is also a landmark page. It has swept away the newspaper characteristics of the past liberal era, and its significance for the public development of the Chinese press in the future is also extremely important. Moreover, the member newspaper companies of the China News Association this time include the entire peaceful region, and there are also Japanese newspaper companies in China participating, so it is truly an unprecedented major unity of Chinese press people and allied newspaper people in China. In order to cooperate with the unity of the press, the Propaganda Department has spared no effort in promoting the organization of the News Association. It specially appointed Guo Xiufeng, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin, Osaka Yoichi, Jin Xiongbo, Qin Mo, and Wu Linzhi, seven influential figures in the press, as preparatory committee members in July of this year, and held a preparatory meeting at the Hua Mao Hotel in Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. on August 5. At the meeting, Minister Lin reported the significance of establishing the China News Association. At 11:00 a.m., Guo assumed the role of temporary chairman and formally convened the first preparatory meeting to begin preparation work. Then, at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon, the second preparatory meeting was convened. By this point, all necessary preparations had been basically completed smoothly. The member newspaper companies have also been reviewed and approved by the Propaganda Department and the Preparatory Committee. It is expected that after the establishment of the association, the member newspapers of the association in various parts of the country will, under the leadership of the association, embrace the same goal and the same belief, and devote their full strength to publicizing national policies and communicating public opinion, so as to assume the great task of ideological warfare under the decisive battle.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles on Peleliu and Other Islands: Japanese Troops Launch Offensive, Sinking More Than Sixty Enemy Ships and Vessels</h3>
<p>Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency): Fierce air battles between Japanese and American forces are taking place on Peleliu and Angaur Islands in the Palau Islands, and on Morotai Island in the Moluccas Islands. Under the cover of powerful mobile units and the air force from the New Guinea base, enemy forces are constantly increasing their strength and launching offensives against the Japanese forces in that area. The resistance of the Japanese troops is extremely fierce. According to a broadcast from San Francisco radio station on the morning of the 17th, the American troops on Peleliu Island encountered stubborn resistance from the Japanese troops and could not progress as expected. The Japanese troops launched three fierce counterattacks in one day. The war situation in various areas is recorded as follows: ○ Peleliu Island: Enemy landing forces, under the cover of fleets, heavy artillery, and aircraft, are adding new troops in an attempt to open up the war situation. The Japanese army's counterattack lasted for 24 hours, and the entire landing force made no progress, remaining near the southern end of the island. Since the enemy began air raids on the 12th, the Japanese army has sunk one enemy cruiser, destroyer, submarine, and minesweeper each around the island, as well as more than sixty landing craft, and destroyed more than one hundred and fifty enemy tanks and shot down twenty-six enemy aircraft (five of which are unconfirmed), and destroyed up to seven. All 150 tanks that the enemy first landed on the 15th were destroyed, suffering heavy damage. ○ Angaur: When the enemy attacked Peleliu Island on the 12th, they also shelled and air-raided the island at the same time in an attempt to suppress the Japanese positions. On the morning of the 14th, they used multiple boats to scout landing points on the eastern coast, and their landing attempt was very obvious. The Japanese troops on the island were prepared. At around 9:00 a.m. on the 17th, the enemy forces began landing under the cover of artillery fire and air raids. The Japanese army fought back bravely, causing the enemy to suffer the same damage as on Peleliu Island. ○ Morotai Island: Enemy forces landed at the southern end of the island and gradually built up the landing point. It now seems that they have begun to build an airfield. The Japanese troops on the island are doing their best to carry out counterattacks to prevent the enemy's progress in construction work. Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the South Pacific base, the Japanese troops on Peleliu Island, from the garrison commander down to the officers and soldiers, are still alive and well, and are fiercely counterattacking the landing enemy forces, causing the enemy forces to fall into a state of confusion. On the evening of the 15th, in the southwestern area of the island, the Japanese tank team and the infantry unit cooperated to launch a fierce attack on the enemy forces occupying the airfield, causing the enemy's position to waver. At the same time, the artillery unit also attacked with machine guns and artillery at the right moment, causing great damage to the enemy, especially in the northwest area, the enemy's confusion was even more obvious. In the operations on the 17th, the Japanese troops concentrated their combat power on the enemy tank units, and all the enemy tanks were destroyed. Although the connection of the Japanese troops in the southern part of the island was sometimes cut off, the Japanese flag could still be seen flying, and the battle is still continuing. South Pacific Japanese Army Its Base, 19th (Central News Agency): The enemy forces shelled Angaur Island with naval gunfire on the morning of the 17th, and at the same time dispatched more than thirty landing craft waiting behind the ships. The heavy artillery positions of the Japanese garrison on the island gave the first batch of enemy landing craft a great blow, causing them to collapse. Although the enemy forces were attacked by fierce Japanese artillery fire, they finally landed on the east coast of the island at 9:00 a.m. The Japanese garrison bravely fought back, launching fierce attacks and repeated night raids. A considerable number of enemy troops landed on that day from morning to dusk. It is reported that they have 2,000 tanks. South Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency): On the 16th, about 150 enemy small aircraft attacked Halmahera Island, and the local Japanese troops shot down and destroyed 20 of them. In addition, around the same time, one enemy torpedo boat entered Anwan on the island and has been sunk by Japanese land artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Advance West along the West River, Approaching Wuzhou and Zhaoqing, Shooting Down Two American Planes in the North</h3>
<p>China Base, 18th (Central News Agency): According to reports from the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft team, the Japanese army is advancing westward along the Nanjiang River. Part of it has broken through the provincial border and is directly approaching Wuzhou, the front-line base of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing in South China. This time, the Japanese army has broken through the steep mountainous area along the West River and launched a rapid attack. Part of it captured Huaiji in Guangxi Province and passed through the south of Xindu (80 kilometers west of Maoji), and on the morning of the 17th, it directly approached a point 30 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou. China Base, 18th (Central News Agency): On the morning and evening of the 17th, the Japanese dive bomber team bombed about 600 Chongqing troops who were collapsing in the mountainous area northwest of Zhaoqing along the West River again. In addition, the Japanese Point Gate team engaged in an interception battle with nine Chongqing and American P-51 aircraft that attacked the vicinity of the Japanese battlefield twice in the morning and afternoon of the 18th. As a result, two of them were shot down in the sky 90 kilometers north of Zhaoqing, and the Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>West River Shaoguan Contact Cut Off</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Front Line, 19th (Central News Agency): After the Japanese South China Army broke into Zhaoqing, the Chongqing Army fell into an irreparable state of confusion. Since this summer, the Chongqing Army miscalculated that the Japanese army intended to open up the Yuehan Line, so it dispatched the main force of the 37th Army Group in the West River Basin area to the north and deployed it on the Yingde Lianjiangkou front line to defend Shaoguan. However, the Japanese army unexpectedly attacked the weak West River Basin area starting from the 9th. Although the Chongqing Army tried to stop the Japanese army from advancing in the Zhaoqing area, the Japanese army urgently cooperated with the naval units advancing along the West River from the east, south, and north sides, and deployed a siege position, and actively advanced, and occupied the key points of Sihui, Gaoming, and Kaiping in an instant. In the evening of the 16th, it annihilated about 10,000 Chongqing troops from the 35th Army Group, broke into Zhaoqing, and at the same time used a strong force to quickly retreat to Deqing, and annihilated the Chongqing troops who were in a state of confusion in the Fengchuan area. Zhaoqing is the forward strategic stronghold of Guangxi Province along the West River. Therefore, after the Japanese army conquered it, in fact, the north and south armies of the Chongqing army in the West River basin were under the control of the Japanese army. The Chongqing army took Deqing and Fengchuan as its vanguard, connecting Wuzhou, and formed a front line, trying to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward, and desperately defended it. However, due to the Japanese army's control of the north bank of the West River, its connection with Shaoguan was completely cut off. Therefore, about two divisions of the 35th Army Group of the Chongqing army completely lost their fighting spirit and fell into a state of collapse.</p>
<h3>Xiangyue Japanese Army Distance Gradually Approaching</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the United News Agency's visiting reporter, the distance between the north and south attacking forces of the Japanese army advancing deep into Guangxi from Hunan and Guangdong provinces is now approaching moment by moment. The gap left by the Japanese army to complete the purpose of cutting off the Chinese mainland is currently only 70 kilometers. This gap is the gap between Yongming (east of Guilin) and Huaiji (more than 30 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou). The aviation base painstakingly managed by the American army in the Guilin area has been destroyed, and the left wing of the Japanese army can reach Yongming. Other Japanese troops can break through the border of Guangxi Province from Guangdong and occupy Huaiji. Once a 70-kilometer gap is opened, the Japanese army will be able to secure the traffic route from southern Manchuria to the South China Sea, and the direct railway from Tokyo to Zhaonan Island planned by Japan can also be successful. For this plan, it is necessary to take the Xianggui Railway as the end point and capture Liuzhou. Secondly, it will establish contact with the Japanese army stationed in Annam. In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese army needs to overcome a distance of 550 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Battle of Guilin is About to Begin</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters report from Chongqing on the 18th, the war situation in Guangxi Province and the movements of the Chongqing army on the Guilin offensive and defensive front line are as follows: The Japanese armored forces are advancing fiercely towards Guilin from the Guangxi Plain, but their vanguard has not yet approached the main force of the Chongqing army defending Guilin. In order to cope with this great battle, the Chongqing army has completed the evacuation of the citizens of Guilin. As for the outcome of the battle, it cannot be predicted today. The equipment of the Japanese army is particularly excellent. At the beginning of the attack, it will definitely cover with artillery fire, tanks, and aircraft. However, the Chongqing army also has favorable conditions, that is, the Japanese army's supply line has now been extended to the roads in Guangxi Province. The Chongqing army can launch guerrilla warfare at will, and the Guilin area is surrounded by huge highlands and mountains for hundreds of miles. These highlands are all natural fortresses, so the future battle will be an extremely tragic one.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Heavily Damage Ganzhou Airfield</h3>
<p>Nanchang, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the Japanese base, the Japanese planes raided the Ganzhou airfield, the front-line base of the Chongqing army, on the night of the 17th, and inflicted heavy damage on it before safely returning to their original defense.</p>

This time, through negotiations with the Japanese government, the Bank of Japan has established a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank. This proves the enthusiasm of the Japanese government to assist the United Reserve Bank notes, and at the same time clarifies the determination to maintain the price of the United Reserve Bank notes from beginning to end. Due to this measure, the foundation of the United Reserve Bank notes has become increasingly strong, which will have a good impact on general prices.

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Explains Alarm Regulations and Answers Several Questions from Various Sectors</h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city believes that citizens of this city still do not fully understand the various air defense measures. The following are answers to several questions from various sectors. (Question) Is there a regulation to stop traffic for ten minutes when the all-clear signal is given? (Answer) The general traffic control is based on the Special Notice No. 4 issued by the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command on July 31, 1944. When the alert signal is issued, all vehicles should immediately stop at a location that does not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians should quickly move to the side of the road and stand by. Five minutes after the alert signal is issued, vehicles should drive at a speed of no more than 20 kilometers (kilometers) per hour. Pedestrians should proceed in order to the extent that it does not obstruct air defense affairs and does not cause traffic accidents. When the air raid alarm is issued, all vehicles and ships should stop at a location that does not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians on land should quickly go to nearby shelters or air-raid shelters to wait, etc. Also, when there are no suitable shelters nearby, pedestrians should pass in order to the extent that it does not obstruct air defense affairs and does not cause traffic accidents ten minutes after the air raid alarm is issued. There is no regulation to stop traffic for ten minutes after the all-clear signal is given. (Question) Is the all-clear signal determined by the sound of the siren or the turning on and off of street lights? (Answer) It is determined by the simultaneous sounding of the all-clear siren, not by the turning on and off of street lights. (Question) Is it necessary for the on-duty personnel of the Air Defense Headquarters to use force? (Answer) The Air Defense Headquarters is responsible for planning, supervising, and promoting all air defense work. There are no on-duty personnel outside. It is probably a misunderstanding. Although personnel such as self-defense groups who implement air defense outside provide assistance and guidance, there is no need to use force, and such behavior is not allowed. If anyone unreasonably uses violence against the people, they will be held accountable according to the law.</p>
<h3>Song-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Service to Open on the 22nd</h3>

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Restricts Front-Seat Tricycles</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has stopped issuing licenses for front-seat double-occupancy commercial tricycles because they do not comply with regulations. As for the remaining front-seat single-occupancy commercial tricycles, because their center of gravity is in the front, it is difficult to brake in an emergency, and the danger is extremely high. Moreover, passengers are prone to accidents in the front. In order to ensure passenger safety, the bureau has adopted a gradual elimination method to eliminate front-seat single-occupancy tricycles. It is hoped that businesses and merchants in the city will stop manufacturing this type of vehicle. As for the existing front-seat single-occupancy tricycles, for the sake of the merchants' difficulties, they will be temporarily allowed to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Poultry Market Registers Chicken and Duck Merchants</h3>
<p>The business rules for the poultry market in this city have been submitted to and approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau.

<h3>French Tram Company Refuses to Restore Original Prices</h3>
<p>Hoping that Relevant Authorities Will Take Effective Measures The problem of the French Tram Company in this city raising prices without authorization has caused great concern among citizens since the Public Utilities Bureau strictly ordered it to be stopped and the public opinion circles sanctioned it. The person in charge of the company promised to restore the original ticket prices from yesterday (19th), but according to on-the-spot investigations, the vehicles on each line of the company were still selling tickets at the increased prices yesterday, which caused great doubts among all citizens. They believe that in order to maintain the government's prestige, it must be done what is said and orders must be followed. The company first increased prices without authorization, and then disobeyed the order and refused to restore the original prices, which is a disregard for laws and regulations, contempt for official orders, and disregard for the condemnation of public opinion of the five million citizens of Shanghai, which is extremely hateful. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly take the most severe and effective measures to maintain prestige and live up to the expectations of the people. (Another report) Ye Xuesong, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, specially visited Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Wu around 4:00 PM yesterday to request instructions on countermeasures.</p>

If police officers demand anything in the future, the parties should immediately report it or file a complaint by name. This court will punish them according to the law. If the parties engage in bribery, the police officers should immediately report it for verification.]</p>
<h3>Forged Cloth Purchase Certificate Found</h3>
<p>On the 18th of this month, someone used a cloth purchase certificate to purchase cloth from a designated retailer (No. 191) on Changshou Road. After careful examination by the retailer, it was found to be forged and was immediately sent to the police station in the district for investigation. After learning of this, the Shanghai Special City Cloth Industry Wholesale Merchants Joint Association immediately notified each designated merchant to pay close attention. Each cloth purchase certificate is issued by the Business Management Association to each designated merchant, with a number stamp and secret code affixed. Therefore, once checked, it can be identified as genuine or fake, and there is no possibility of counterfeiting. It is hoped that citizens will not be greedy for small profits and resell them to avoid being deceived, and each designated merchant must first carefully check the number of the cloth purchase certificate before purchasing cloth, and identify the authenticity of the secret code to avoid confusion.</p>
