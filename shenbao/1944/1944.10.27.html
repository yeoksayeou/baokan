<p>社評</p>
<h3>論菲律賓戰局</h3>
<p>敵美海空軍在台灣海戰中受重創敗退後，即集合殘敗艦船，於十八日在菲島中部一個小島—雷伊泰島登陸，日艦隊自二十四日晨起在菲島東海面，海空軍運成一體，轉入外國，對侵入菲島之敵美海軍及運輸船團，予給凶圍攔載的打擊和殲滅。菲律賓羣島是保衛日本本土的海上外衛防綫，隱忍自重，等待時機之日本海軍，必然握住此適切時機，發揮其歷史上傳統的海軍精神，掃蕩敵美夢想制覇大東亞的野心。同時，敵美爲掩飾敗績，挽回頹勢，以取得反軸心國間的信任計，可能挾其自誇優勢之物資，在菲島海面上，作[狗急跳牆]式的孤注一戰。如此，雷伊泰島登陸，將演成太平洋上大決戰。關於敵美侵入菲律賓羣島之用意，我們於昨評中巳有論及。茲再就戰略上來檢討菲律賓戰局前途，說明敵美的自取滅亡。　　日本海軍，自從塞班島戰役以來，所以隱忍自重，是適切選擇時機，準備集中足以擊滅敵人之兵力，在決戰以前予敵人以最大損害，使敵人一蹶不振，取得易於獲得勝利的主動地位。敵人進攻台灣失敗，急燥不安，未及補充，即想奪回菲島，切斷與日本本土間連絡，在戰略上採用[逆戰法]，巳屬冒險。且海戰補給較陸戰困難，敵美海長福萊斯達爾承認[太平洋戰事之最大困難，係在於補給其所需之補給力，將爲歐戰所需者之三倍，故其補給之困難，將隨美軍之前進而增大，且困難之增大率，與距離之增大，不能成正比例]。今殘敗艦船，未及整補，即繼續戰鬥，需要後方之補給更大，困難也更甚。反之，日本海軍無此種困難來束縛戰略上的決戰。如果這次敵美進攻台灣，能如在雷伊泰島獲得立足點，即日本海軍在戰略上將遭遇些困難。因爲敵美如在台灣建立橋頭堡，則可能在中國東南沿海地帶奪取據點，減去一面的威脅，不致完全暴露海上補給困難弱點。這次日本海軍擊潰敵美進攻台灣企圖，壓迫敵人至菲島作冒險的行動，這是基於戰略上的要求，亦是日本海軍在戰略上第一步成功。　　其次，我們就日本大本營連日所發表菲島的戰果，已擊沉擊毀大小敵艦六十餘艘，雷伊泰灣登陸敵軍之命運，也已判定其惟有滅亡之途。所以，就目前實際的情勢而言，盟邦軍隊在極短時間內，即可擊潰敵美艦隊無疑了。　　基於上述，日本海軍在戰略上居絕對優勢的地位，加以旺盛的士氣，奮勇的精神，菲律賓戰局，將成爲日本保衛大東亞戰爭的道義性格的最高表現，我們大東亞共榮圈的的人民，應一致奮起，共同把握這最好機會。</p>
<h3>菲律賓東方海面大戰繼續進行中</h3>
<p>敵空母及巡洋艦又有七艘沉毀　　雷伊泰灣敵艦船沉毀五十餘艘　　東京二十六日中央社電　日本大本營二十六日下午五時發表：菲律賓東方海面，敵我海空戰鬥仍在繼續進行中，至今判時這加戰果如次：擊沉航空母艦二艘，巡洋艦一艘，擊毀航空母艦四艘。　　東京二十六日中央社電　日大本營二十六日下午四時五十分發表：（一）雷伊泰島日陸上部隊，自十月二十日以來，即對在塔克羅班南及克拉克附近登陸之敵約三師團加以邀擊，刻仍在奮戰中。（二）日航空部隊於十月十九日以來，即連續攻擊雷伊泰灣內之敵運輸船團及其護衛艦艇，日艦隊亦會於二十六日佛曉突入雷伊泰灣內，對數敵艦強襲，截至現在止，經確認在雷伊泰灣之綜合戰果（自炸未歸還飛機所獲之戰果不在內），日軍擊沉敵方小運輸船五艘，使其起火焚燒者十一艘，擱淺者四艘，擊毀者二艘，並擊毀敵航空母艦二艘，敵戰艦中擱淺者一艘，被擊毀者二艘，敵巡洋艦被擊沉者二艘，被擊毀者三艘，敵驅逐艦被擊沉者一艘，被擊毀者三艘，敵大型登陸用舟艇擊沉者十七艘，被擊毀起火焚燒者二艘，是役日方損害除戰艦被擊沉及受傷者各一艘外，並有飛機若干架自炸及未歸還原防。</p>
<h3>日軍在菲島周圍確保制海制空權</h3>
<p>海上部隊已突進新戰塲　　菲島前綫二十六日中央社電　菲律賓周圍之制海制空權，已爲日軍所確保，故敵機對菲律賓方面之空襲，已呈弱勢，如二十五日來襲菲律賓方面之敵機，僅有大型七架，比薩亞地方僅有兩架。</p>
<h3>充分發揮一體威力</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日航空部隊自台灣海面空戰中，予敵美有力機動部隊以潰滅之打擊以來，則嚴加監視敵之動向，其間敵雖在中部太平洋作戰中深受挫折，然猶冀挼其預定計劃，對菲律實推進作戰。十七日以來，即以若干勢力在菲律賓雷伊泰灣方面登陸，蓋菲律賓作戰，從敵美之立塲而觀，實係一在太平洋之主要作戰，故日美該方面之作戰，對大東亞戰爭之前途影響至爲深鉅。敵人爲掩飾其在台灣方面空戰後之敗戰事實，乃反而宣傳菲律賓方面戰局之緊迫，鈎心鬥角，動員其敗殘艦隊，對菲律賓推行正式作戰，然日聯合艦隊海上部隊，爲應付此歷史上之推移，乃與航空部隊呼應，毅然決然開始猛攻敵有力航空艦羣，充分發揮海上航空部隊及潛艇渾然一體之威力，此實爲第一次所羅門海戰以來所未嘗見者。蓋日海上部隊過去即會嚴厲監視戰局之推移，作沉着之應付，以備行將來臨之決戰，故日海上部隊當此出擊時期業已降臨之今日，乃得以呼應海上航空部隊，而突進菲律賓東方海面之新戰塲，蓋自吉爾貝特作戰以來，敵會引誘日艦隊出動，而敵之所謂艦隊，顯係指海上部隊而言，惟日海軍海上部隊出擊之戰機，實屬於日方之主動權，日方即對於敵之任何行動，亦能如其所期與敵周旋，況今決戰準備業已完成，於是日方遂先行發動敵人所求之不斷之決戰，而菲律賓東方風雲，亦因此而告急矣。</p>
<h3>南洋各地空襲</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地二十五日中央社電　馬紹爾羣島亞爾民島，二十三日白畫有敵小型機若干架來襲。又西南太平洋基地二十五日電，塞蘭島普拉二十三日白晝有敵中型機約四十架來襲，被日方擊落三架。又安東是日白晝亦有敵機二十四架來襲。</p>
<h3>日艦隊作戰以質爲重點</h3>
<p>敵無戰術潰滅期不遠　　中央社訊　滬日海軍專門家，頃就日大本營發表菲律賓東方海面大戰果觀察如下：決定大東亞之勝負戰爭，乃由台灣東方海面而起，目下從菲律賓東方海面展開激烈大戰中。查敵美雖有戰略而無戰術，故敵主力之飛機業已大部撲滅，尤其所有艦隊亦四分五裂，在茲時期，在日本聯合艦隊猛烈總攻擊下，吾人不得不加以注意者，如今日美海戰狀態，查日本艦隊自過去七十年以來，對艦隊作戰，均受猛烈訓練及集中鍛鍊，以求質爲重點，然而敵美祇以數目爲集中點，所有船隻亦未受過相當訓練，船員及士兵技術差劣，故在此次砲擊戰中，經日本艦隊突進敵艦隊之時而敵方即遭遇擊滅，當時敵方最長懼者，乃日本主力艦之旗砲，往往徘徊狼狽竄遁，在今日大本營所發表之敵艦逃遁時大概已經擱淺，於此可見敵方之有戰略而無戰術，如今敵方受到日本艦隊之突進後，則勝利即可決定，依據今日日本大本營所發表之大戰果，在遭遇日軍砲擊下的敵美海軍，其潰滅之期，當不在遠。</p>
<h3>襲九州敵機墜毀廿四架</h3>
<p>日大本營昨發表戰果　　東京二十六日中央社電　日大本營二十六日十二時發表：二十五日敵機B29型來襲九州及濟州島時，日軍所獲戰果如次：擊落五架，擊毀十九架，合計二十四架。　　東京二十六日中央社電　福岡電話，駐渝美空軍第二十部隊，邇來積極增強實力，窺伺空襲日本北九州之機會，二十五日出動B29型機約百架，分作數隊，以六七千米之超高空飛行，侵入九州西部地區。日制空部隊精稅對之迎擊，力予猛攻，敵編隊即陷混亂潰散，而侵入大村，天草，熊本，佐賀等地，均爲所在地日制空部隊所阻，未能達到其轟炸重要地帶之目的，徒在有明海與佐軸縣之山地一帶，盲目投下炸彈及燒夷彈。日方損失，僅限於一小處，且極輕微，十一時敵機即向九州西方海面遁去。</p>
<h3>日陸軍機巧妙邀擊</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日防空部隊，對二十五日來襲九州及濟州島之駐渝美空軍B29型機約百架之敵機羣加以猛攻，是役戰果已爲日大本營發表，計擊落五架，擊毀十九架，重創其總數之四分之一，敵軍前於八月二十日及二十一日以及二十二日不下百架編隊襲擊北九州時，會損失五十餘架，丙中擊落二十三架，故於今來襲之際，深懼日防空部隊之威力，幾乎未敢接近，僅由高空侵入，採取盲炸手段，然日陸軍機隊及高射砲部隊乃予以巧妙殲滅，遂獲如此戰東，此中擊毀之十九架，業已證實噴吐黑烟，由其基地之距離推算，能否歸還成都，實成疑題，或於中途墮落，乃至被迫降陸者，恐非少數。</p>

<h3>日軍航空隊三次攻擊紀</h3>
<p>雷伊泰島上敵軍孤立　　東京二十六日中央社電　日陸海空軍自二十四日晨以來，協力邀擊在菲律賓登陸之美軍及其海上機動部隊，斷然採取攻勢，相繼猛襲敵艦隊及運輸船團，至二十六日仍在追擊中，茲總其戰鬥詳情如次：一日軍出動前，敵美艦隊勢力係以空母二艘乃至三艘爲主幹之機動部隊約二三羣，空母約八艘，中三艘乃至四艘爲制式航空母艦，均出動地距呂宋島東方三百乃至四百哩之海上。二十四日，日軍航空隊會作三次攻擊，第一次攻擊，在上午十時三十分飛達戰塲，計炸毀敵空母三艘，大型巡洋艦二艘擊落敵機三十餘架。第二次攻擊，在下午三時三十五分飛達戰塲，則截擊以空母四艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘組成之敵機動部隊，當炸毀敵瓦斯浦型空母一艘。第三次攻擊於二十四日夜開始，以敵艦隊最北一羣爲攻擊目標，計炸沉敵大型空母一艘，二十四日夜，日潛水艦隊猛攻向雷伊泰方面航行中之敵輪送船團，計擊沉敵運輸艦四艘。二十五日日軍亦攻擊敵海上艦隊，自上午七時半至八時半止，計擊沉敵航空母艦四艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一艘。日空軍并施行夜襲，係以北部之敵艦隊爲轟炸目標，其所獲戰果，計炸沉敵航空母艦一艘，轟沉敵巡洋艦一艘，重創敵航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，此次日航空部隊於十九日以來，海上艦艇部隊於二十五日指曉，亦會分別進攻集結於雷伊泰灣內之敵艦隊，計擊毀戰艦三至四艘三十至四十艘，因之敵航空母艦，巡洋艦，運輸艦，運輸船多被擊沉，或卒被擊沉或擊毀，其面目如下：計敵運輸船被擊沉者五艘，被擊毀起火焚燒者十一艘，被炸擱淺者四艘，被擊毀者二艘，敵機空母艦被擊毀者二艘，戰艦被擊擱淺者一艘，被擊傷者二艘，敵巡洋艦被擊沉者二艘，被擊毀者三艘，敵驅逐艦被擊沉者一艘，被擊毀者三艘，敵大型海陸用舟艇被擊沉者十五艘，被擊毀起火焚燒者二艘　　東京二十六日中央社電　美軍進攻雷伊泰島後，即大肆宣傳，據麥克沃塞發表稱：美艦隊蔽覆海面馳抵菲賓登陸，爲日方之沉着所致，故雷伊泰一角之敵軍，亦忽呆然若失，數日後果然日海空軍精銳忽然出現於美艦羣之正面及上空，對之加以攻擊，敵結果已喪失五十八機動部隊大半之哈爾賽第三艦隊，又遭台灣海面之慘敗，被迫倉惶遁去。現菲律賓東方海面之日海軍部隊繼續追擊中，其尤堪悲痛者，乃雷伊泰島之小橋頭堡，至二十五日暮刻與海面之聯絡完全斷絕，形成無援孤立之形勢，登陸軍之命運，已深知危在旦夕，日軍將開始着手處理。</p>
<h3>新民聯恊會昨行揭幕式</h3>

<h3>汪主席訓詞</h3>
<p>北平二十六日中央社電　新民會全體聯合協議會開幕禮中，國府外交部長褚民誼氏，特代表汪主席蒞會致訓，茲誌訓詞大意如次：自民國三十年十二月大東亞戰爭發生以後，國府即發表聲明，決與盟邦日本同甘共苦，傾舉全力以協力戰爭。爲使全國人民擔當此新責任，完成其新使命起見，爰於三十一年一月，發起新國民運動，至去年一月九日，國民政府毅然參戰，進而以同生共死精神，與盟邦共同分擔保衛大東亞之責任，以實行國民運動，即是國民精神總動員。其作用在煥發國民新精神，使其參加共同組織與訓練，集中意志，充實能力，使精神建設，與物質建議，雙方面同時并進。所謂新者，一方面改革旣往，一方面努力創造未來。數年以來，由於諸君努力實踐之結果，使此種新精神，已普遍滲透於華北民衆各階層間，對推行國策，完遂戰爭，實有極大之貢獻。現大東亞戰爭已進入決戰階段，中國當前之最大任務，即爲與盟邦同心協力，以爭取戰爭最後勝利。華北雖地屬後方，而在人口經濟治安諸方面，對戰爭關係至爲密切，故其所負責任亦至爲重大。就人口以言，華北擁有國民一億之衆，此多數之國民，應如何加以指導訓練，使其意志集中，步伐整齊，成爲極堅強之鬥士。就經濟以言，華北擁有大量物資，爲軍需工業必要原料，應如何加以開發，而期生產之增加，貢獻於戰爭。就治安以方，如何肅清貪污，掃除匪患，而使治安得以確保，生產益形增加。更進而增強行政推進上之效率。凡此諸端，固已爲政府施政重點，而亦須人民之協力推進，俾能完成所期目的。值茲聯合協議會開幕之際，特申數言，以期共勉。</p>

<h3>南匯巡禮</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>連日苦雨，雨後天晴的太陽，令人倍覺可愛。記者於月之廿一日，在晨光微曦中踏上黃浦江邊，僱得一葉小舟，渡至對岸的浦東，在東昌路登岸後，逕往東亞公司之汽車站購周浦票，頃刻開行，同車共七人，中途有軍人搭乘，以車內已告客滿，故皆站立於踏足板處，左右各一，不啻爲乘客等之義務保鏣。沿途此去彼來，川流不息，熱鬧非凡。公路失修兼以載重過重，故車行如牛。否則即有拋錨之處，車行一時許，抵周浦，改乘滬南汽車公司之大卡車，轉往南滙，車中乘擁客至爲擠，後到者幾無插足之地。此段公路因雨後路滑，兼以路面崎嶇不平，故顚跛之程度無異，乘客不勝其苦，但賣票員能攀沿車身四周往返執行職務，身輕若燕，記者深佩此君之身手，自嘆勿如。抵南滙縣城巳過午時，茲將連日見聞所及略作一簡單之報告：</p>
<h3>城區內外一</h3>
<p>南滙爲一小城，周圍僅三里許，城墻至矮，其高度僅如上海富戶大宅之圍墻，城外有護城河一道，環城而行，河中時有民船往來，點綴其間，襯以一望無際之綠野，實令人有忘却塵世而作超然之感想。記者總覺大自然之美，決非身居都市中人所能想像，必身臨其境者始能領略之一。　　南滙城內之路政，令人實覺失望，蓋獨一無二的所謂大街，寬不及大，兩旁屋　幾相連接，石板舖道高低不平，天雨時如着橫皮底鞋，大有[行不得也哥哥]之嘆。至小巷深弄則垃圾狼藉，臭氣衝天，行人掩鼻，如在夏季則對衛生妨礙更甚，似有整頓之必要。　　此間民性至爲樸實，衣着方面，除外來極少數之公務人員，洋裝者絕無僅有，一律布衣。對外來旅客，亦禮貌有加，多方協助，予人便利，實非都市人的盛氣凌人，專欺鄉曲者所可擬比。</p>
<h3>物價高漲與支票盛行</h3>
<p>一般物價頗高，除特產之花生山芋及魚蝦等外，米價幾與滬市相等，肉價亦不相上下，日用品如肥皂火柴等及香烟皆較上海約貴五成。熱水瓶在此間風疛至健，幾每戶皆備，蓋以稻草價昂故煮水不易，即茶館亦須過午時始行營業，如此生活，無怪此間一般薪金微薄的公務員，呌苦連天，蓋普通公務員之所有收入，僅及生活必需費之四分之一。據記者調查此間兩家典當的顧主，泰半爲此批災官耳。又此間尚有另一奇蹟，即支票盛行，蓋市面上不論大小交易，或私人授受，皆以支票往來，票期恒在三四月以上者，空頭支票之糾紛，在所離免。然此風並不因此而少改，其故乃以出票者，類皆有槍階級，或有潛勢力者，商民焉敢拒用。但物極必反，最近亦發生商店全體罷市之風潮。更有滑稽者，甚至有吃餛飩一碗，授小販以千元支票一紙，令找餘款，設非記者目睹，言來實難令人置信。</p>
<h3>治安與農村情形</h3>
<p>南滙縣計分八區：一城箱鎭，二竺橋，三六杜，四張江柵，五周浦，六邵家樓，七新塲，八大團。治安方面，除上列之大鎭外，其附近十餘里處，時有遊擊隊及土匪之踪跡，即記者到達之日，此間西外護城河中之小船內，亦破獲遊擊隊兩名。記者與鄉民談及此事，大有談虎變色之勢，夜間城內九時後，行人絕跡，往來者亦祇軍警滿街耳。　　南滙縣共計農田約兩百四十萬畝，分東西兩鄉，東鄉分團甲制，西鄉則爲保圖制，全縣人口計五二五九九○，農民佔絕大多數。茲就東鄉言，計田六十萬畝，共分七團，每團計九甲，田分蔗田、灶田兩種。而蔗田又分老蔗、新升、已國三種。價格以目下地價高漲，蔗田價格每畝巳值三萬元，新升亦值兩萬，已圍約萬元。　　農民多由崇明啓東餘姚移墾至此，其農作物以雜糧爲大宗，有花生山芋大豆苞米。至於棉花則近以產量與價格關係，農民已改種山芋等物。其擔負除每畝田賦蔗田灶田計一百七十一元，米圍七十二元外，尚須由田賦帶征軍警米費，每畝一百五十元。其他如鄉鎭事業費等苛稅雜稅，農民總計每畝須再擔負四百餘元，而不時尚須供應軍警各方之柴薪油等實物。故目下農村農民因擔負之繁重，致使農民終歲勤勞，難圖溫飽，此實屬當今之嚴重問題也。</p>

        <h1>1944.10.27</h1>
<h3>On the Philippine Battle Situation</h3>
<p>After being severely damaged and retreating in the sea and air battle off Taiwan, the enemy American naval and air forces gathered their remaining ships and landed on the small island of Leyte in the central Philippines on the 18th. Starting from the morning of the 24th, the Japanese fleet, with its naval and air forces united, moved overseas in the eastern sea of the Philippines, dealing a fierce encircling and intercepting blow to the invading enemy American navy and transport ships, aiming for their annihilation. The Philippine Islands are the maritime outer defense line protecting the Japanese mainland. The Japanese navy, which has been enduring and biding its time, waiting for the right moment, will surely seize this opportune moment, display its historically traditional naval spirit, and sweep away the enemy American ambition to dominate East Asia. At the same time, in order to cover up their defeat, reverse the decline, and gain the trust of the anti-Axis nations, the enemy American forces may, relying on their self-proclaimed superior resources, engage in a desperate "cornered dog jumping over the wall" style battle on the Philippine seas. Thus, the landing on Leyte Island will develop into a major decisive battle in the Pacific. Regarding the enemy American intentions in invading the Philippine Islands, we already discussed them in yesterday's commentary. Now, we will further examine the future of the Philippine battle situation from a strategic perspective, explaining the enemy American self-destruction. The Japanese navy, since the Battle of Saipan, has been enduring and biding its time in order to appropriately choose the moment, prepare to concentrate forces sufficient to destroy the enemy, inflict maximum damage on the enemy before the decisive battle, render the enemy unable to recover, and gain the initiative to easily achieve victory. The enemy's failed offensive on Taiwan, driven by impatience and restlessness, without sufficient replenishment, attempted to recapture the Philippines, cutting off communication with the Japanese mainland. Strategically adopting a "reverse warfare method" is already risky. Moreover, naval warfare resupply is more difficult than land warfare. Enemy American naval commander Fletcher admitted that "the greatest difficulty in the Pacific war is supplying its needed supplies, which will be three times that required in the European war. Therefore, the difficulty of resupply will increase with the American advance, and the rate of increase in difficulty will not be proportional to the increase in distance." Now, the battered ships, without proper repair and replenishment, continue to fight, requiring even greater resupply from the rear, and the difficulties are even greater. Conversely, the Japanese navy does not have this kind of difficulty to constrain strategic decisions. If the enemy American forces in this attack on Taiwan had been able to gain a foothold as they did on Leyte Island, the Japanese navy would have encountered some strategic difficulties. Because if the enemy American forces established a bridgehead in Taiwan, they could seize strongholds in the southeastern coastal areas of China, reducing the threat from one side and not completely exposing the weakness of maritime resupply difficulties. This time, the Japanese navy crushed the enemy American attempt to attack Taiwan, forcing the enemy to take adventurous actions in the Philippines. This is based on strategic requirements and is also the first strategic success of the Japanese navy. Secondly, based on the daily reports from the Japanese General Headquarters, the Philippine battle results show that more than sixty enemy ships, large and small, have been sunk and destroyed. The fate of the enemy forces landing in Leyte Gulf has also been determined to be nothing but annihilation. Therefore, in terms of the current actual situation, there is no doubt that the allied forces will be able to defeat the enemy American fleet in a very short time. Based on the above, the Japanese navy holds an absolutely superior strategic position, coupled with vigorous morale and courageous spirit. The Philippine battle situation will become the highest expression of the righteous character of Japan's Greater East Asia War for the defense of East Asia. The people of our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should rise up together and seize this best opportunity.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Continuing in the Eastern Sea of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Another Seven Enemy Aircraft Carriers and Cruisers Sunk and Destroyed More Than Fifty Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed in Leyte Gulf</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 26th: Sea and air battles between the enemy and our forces are still continuing in the eastern sea of the Philippines. The confirmed results of the fighting so far are as follows: Two aircraft carriers and one cruiser sunk; four aircraft carriers destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:50 PM on the 26th: (1) Since October 20th, Japanese ground troops on Leyte Island have been engaging and repelling about three enemy divisions that landed near Tacloban South and Clark. They are still fighting fiercely. (2) Since October 19th, Japanese air units have continuously attacked enemy transport convoys and their escorting vessels in Leyte Gulf. The Japanese fleet also broke into Leyte Gulf at dawn on the 26th and launched a strong assault on numerous enemy ships. As of now, the confirmed overall results in Leyte Gulf (excluding the results obtained by suicide planes that did not return) are: The Japanese army sunk five enemy small transport ships, set eleven on fire, ran four aground, and destroyed two. It also destroyed two enemy aircraft carriers, ran one enemy battleship aground, destroyed two, sank two enemy cruisers, destroyed three, sunk one enemy destroyer, destroyed three, sunk seventeen enemy large landing craft, and destroyed and set two on fire. In this operation, the Japanese side suffered losses of one battleship sunk and one damaged, as well as several planes lost to suicide attacks and not returning to base.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Secure Control of the Sea and Air Around the Philippines</h3>
<p>Naval Units Have Advanced to the New Battlefield</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese forces have secured control of the sea and air around the Philippines. Therefore, enemy air raids on the Philippines have weakened. For example, only seven large enemy planes attacked the Philippines on the 25th, and only two attacked the Visayas region.</p>
<h3>Fully Demonstrate Integrated Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese air force inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy American powerful mobile force in the sea and air battle off Taiwan, it has been closely monitoring the enemy's movements. Although the enemy suffered setbacks in operations in the central Pacific, it still hoped to advance its planned operations in the Philippines. Since the 17th, it has landed some forces in the Leyte Gulf area of the Philippines. The Philippine operation, from the enemy American standpoint, is a major operation in the Pacific, so the Japanese-American operations in that area have a profound impact on the future of the Greater East Asia War. In order to cover up the fact of its defeat in the air battle off Taiwan, the enemy is instead publicizing the urgency of the battle situation in the Philippines, engaging in scheming, and mobilizing its battered fleet to carry out formal operations in the Philippines. However, the Japanese Combined Fleet naval forces, in response to this historical shift, coordinated with the air force and resolutely launched a fierce attack on the enemy's powerful aircraft carrier group, fully demonstrating the integrated power of the naval air force and submarines. This has not been seen since the First Solomon Sea Battle. In the past, the Japanese naval forces have been closely monitoring the developments of the war, responding calmly, and preparing for the impending decisive battle. Therefore, now that the time has come for the Japanese naval forces to strike, they are able to coordinate with the naval air force and break into the new battlefield in the eastern sea of the Philippines. Since the Gilbert operation, the enemy has been enticing the Japanese fleet to come out, and the enemy's so-called fleet clearly refers to the naval forces. However, the timing of the Japanese naval forces' attack is entirely at the initiative of the Japanese side. The Japanese side can deal with any enemy action as it wishes. Moreover, now that preparations for the decisive battle have been completed, the Japanese side has taken the initiative to launch the continuous decisive battle that the enemy seeks, and the situation in the eastern Philippines has become urgent as a result.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Various Parts of the South Seas</h3>
<p>Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency) Several enemy small planes attacked Yamil Island in the Marshall Islands during the day on the 23rd. Also, a dispatch from a base in the southwestern Pacific on the 25th reported that about forty enemy medium-sized planes attacked Pula, Seram Island, during the day on the 23rd, and three were shot down by the Japanese side. Also, twenty-four enemy planes attacked Antong during the day on the same day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Focuses on Quality in Operations</h3>
<p>Enemy Lacks Tactics, Collapse Not Far Off</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report A naval expert in Shanghai recently observed the results of the major battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, as follows: The war that will determine the victory or defeat of Greater East Asia began in the eastern sea of Taiwan and is now unfolding in a fierce major battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines. The enemy Americans have strategy but lack tactics. Therefore, most of the enemy's main aircraft have already been destroyed, and all of the fleets have been scattered. At this time, under the fierce general attack of the Japanese Combined Fleet, what we must pay attention to is the current state of the Japanese-American naval battle. The Japanese fleet has undergone intense training and concentrated refinement for fleet operations for the past seventy years, focusing on quality. However, the enemy Americans focus only on quantity, and all of the ships have not undergone sufficient training, and the skills of the crew and soldiers are poor. Therefore, in this artillery battle, when the Japanese fleet broke into the enemy fleet, the enemy was immediately destroyed. At that time, what the enemy feared most was the flagship guns of the Japanese main battleships, and they often wandered around in a panic. Today, according to the announcement of the General Headquarters, the enemy ships probably ran aground while fleeing. From this, we can see that the enemy has strategy but lacks tactics. Now that the enemy has been broken through by the Japanese fleet, victory can be determined. Based on today's announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters of the major battle results, the collapse of the enemy American navy under Japanese artillery fire cannot be far off.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Four Enemy Planes Attacking Kyushu Shot Down</h3>
<p>Japanese General Headquarters Announced Battle Results Yesterday</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 26th: When enemy B29-type planes attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th, the battle results obtained by the Japanese army were as follows: five shot down, nineteen destroyed, totaling twenty-four.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Fukuoka telephone report: The US Air Force's 20th Bombardment Wing stationed in Chongqing has been actively increasing its strength, watching for opportunities to attack northern Kyushu, Japan, by air. On the 25th, it dispatched about a hundred B29-type planes, divided into several formations, flying at an ultra-high altitude of six to seven thousand meters, and invaded the western region of Kyushu. The elite Japanese air defense units intercepted and attacked them fiercely. The enemy formations fell into confusion and scattered. The intrusions into Omura, Amakusa, Kumamoto, Saga, and other places were all blocked by the local Japanese air defense units, failing to achieve their goal of bombing important areas, and blindly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in the Ariake Sea and the mountainous areas of Saga Prefecture. The Japanese side's losses were limited to a small area and were extremely minor. At 11:00, the enemy planes fled to the sea west of Kyushu.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Planes Cleverly Intercept</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese air defense units fiercely attacked the group of about a hundred enemy planes of the US Air Force's B29-type planes stationed in Chongqing, which attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th. The battle results of this operation have been announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, with a total of five shot down and nineteen destroyed, severely damaging one-quarter of the total. Previously, when the enemy attacked northern Kyushu with a formation of no less than a hundred planes on August 20, 21, and 22, it lost more than fifty planes, with twenty-three shot down. Therefore, when attacking this time, they were deeply afraid of the power of the Japanese air defense units and hardly dared to approach, only invading from high altitude and adopting blind bombing tactics. However, the Japanese army air squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery units skillfully annihilated them, resulting in such battle results. It has been confirmed that the nineteen destroyed planes were spewing black smoke, and based on the distance from their base, it is doubtful whether they can return to Chengdu, and it is feared that many will fall midway or be forced to land.</p>

<h3>Records of Three Attacks by Japanese Air Squadrons</h3>
<p>Enemy Forces Isolated on Leyte Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Since the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have cooperated to intercept the American forces landing in the Philippines and their maritime mobile forces, decisively adopting offensive actions and successively attacking enemy fleets and transport convoys. The pursuit is still underway on the 26th. The details of the battle are summarized as follows: Before the Japanese forces launched the attack, the enemy American fleet consisted of about 2-3 groups of mobile forces mainly composed of 2-3 aircraft carriers each, about 8 aircraft carriers in total, including 3-4 standard aircraft carriers, all operating at sea 300-400 miles east of Luzon Island. On the 24th, the Japanese air squadrons carried out three attacks. The first attack reached the battlefield at 10:30 AM, destroying 3 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 large cruisers, and shooting down more than 30 enemy planes. The second attack reached the battlefield at 3:35 PM, intercepting an enemy mobile force composed of 4 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 2 cruisers, and destroying one enemy Wasp-class aircraft carrier. The third attack began on the night of the 24th, targeting the northernmost group of the enemy fleet, sinking one enemy large aircraft carrier. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese submarine fleet fiercely attacked the enemy transport convoys sailing towards Leyte, sinking 4 enemy transport ships. On the 25th, the Japanese forces also attacked the enemy naval fleet. From 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM, they sunk 4 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 cruisers, and 1 destroyer. The Japanese air force also carried out a night raid, with the northern enemy fleet as the bombing target. The battle results obtained were: one enemy aircraft carrier sunk, one enemy cruiser sunk, and two enemy aircraft carriers and one battleship heavily damaged. Since the 19th, the Japanese air force and the maritime naval units, starting from dawn on the 25th, also separately attacked the enemy fleet gathered in Leyte Gulf, destroying 3-4 battleships and 30-40 other ships. As a result, many enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, transport ships, and transports were sunk or destroyed, as follows: 5 enemy transport ships sunk, 11 destroyed and set on fire, 4 bombed and grounded, and 2 destroyed. 2 enemy aircraft carriers destroyed, 1 enemy battleship grounded, and 2 damaged. 2 enemy cruisers sunk, and 3 destroyed. 1 enemy destroyer sunk, and 3 destroyed. 15 enemy large amphibious craft sunk, and 2 destroyed and set on fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) After the American forces attacked Leyte Island, they publicized it widely. According to MacArthur's announcement, the American fleet arrived off the Philippines, covering the sea for the landing, due to the Japanese side's calmness. Therefore, the enemy forces at one corner of Leyte were also suddenly stunned. A few days later, the elite Japanese naval and air forces suddenly appeared in front of and above the American fleet group and attacked it. As a result, the enemy lost most of the 58th Mobile Force, the Third Fleet of Halsey, and was forced to flee in panic after suffering a terrible defeat in the waters off Taiwan. Currently, the Japanese naval forces in the eastern sea of the Philippines are continuing the pursuit. What is particularly lamentable is that the small bridgehead on Leyte Island was completely cut off from communication with the sea by dusk on the 25th, forming an isolated and helpless situation. The fate of the landing forces is deeply known to be precarious, and the Japanese forces will begin to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of the New People's Allied Association Held Yesterday</h3>

<p>Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) The New People's Association's general joint conference for the 33rd year was solemnly held in the Huiren Hall of Zhongnanhai this morning (26th) at 10:00 AM. The ceremony was extremely solemn. Those present included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government, Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and Chairman of the New People's Association, and representatives of various agencies and organizations. The allied nations of Japan, Germany, and Italy also sent representatives to attend, totaling more than a thousand people. After the meeting began, formalities were observed. First, Vice Chairman Yu delivered the opening remarks, followed by Foreign Minister Chu delivering instructions on behalf of Chairman Wang, and then Chairman Wang Kemin of the New People's Association delivered instructions. Then, representatives from various countries delivered congratulatory speeches. Afterwards, congratulatory telegrams from all parties were read, and the chairman issued representative certificates. Next, the representatives took an oath, and Wang Jiarui was appointed as the Speaker, Wang Zisheng as the Deputy Speaker, Zhang Zijun as the Secretary-General, and Zhang Xinghua as the Deputy Secretary-General.

The entire joint conference will last for five days, reviewing and discussing cases until the closing ceremony on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Instructions</h3>
<p>Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) At the opening ceremony of the New People's Association general joint conference, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government specially attended the meeting on behalf of Chairman Wang to deliver instructions. The main points of the instructions are recorded as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the National Government has issued a statement resolving to share weal and woe with the allied nation of Japan and to devote all its strength to cooperate in the war. In order to enable the people of the whole country to shoulder this new responsibility and fulfill its new mission, the New National Movement was initiated in January of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). On January 9th of last year, the National Government resolutely entered the war, and with a spirit of shared life and death, jointly shouldered the responsibility of defending Greater East Asia with the allied nations. To carry out the National Movement is to mobilize the national spirit. Its purpose is to inspire a new national spirit, enabling the people to participate in common organizations and training, concentrate their will, and enrich their abilities, so that spiritual construction and material proposals can advance simultaneously on both sides. The so-called "new" means reforming the past on the one hand, and striving to create the future on the other. In the past few years, thanks to the efforts and practices of all of you, this new spirit has permeated all levels of the North China people, making a great contribution to promoting national policies and completing the war. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the greatest task facing China is to work together with the allied nations to win the final victory of the war. Although North China belongs to the rear, its relationship to the war is extremely close in terms of population, economy, and security. Therefore, its responsibility is also very great. In terms of population, North China has a population of 100 million. How should this large number of people be guided and trained so that their will is concentrated and their steps are aligned, becoming extremely strong fighters? In terms of economy, North China has a large amount of materials, which are necessary raw materials for military industries. How should they be developed to increase production and contribute to the war? In terms of security, how should corruption be eliminated, banditry be eradicated, and security be ensured, so that production can be further increased? Furthermore, how should the efficiency of administrative advancement be enhanced? All of these are already the focus of the government's policies, and also require the cooperation and promotion of the people in order to achieve the desired goals. On the occasion of the opening of the joint conference, I would like to state these points in the hope of mutual encouragement.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Longling</h3>
<p>Japanese Base on the Burmese Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The main force of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has approached the Japanese army positions in Longling, and part of it has moved southeast of Longling, gathering a large army northeast of Mangshi, challenging the Japanese army. However, due to the preemptive attacks of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses and seems unwilling to fight. However, they are coordinating with the British Indian army and the Chongqing army stationed in India in the Myitkyina area, eager to try. At the same time, they are strengthening the nearly completed Ledo Road-Myitkyina highway and the airfield in the Fort Hertz area, in order to wait for these air and land supply routes to be completed, and then launch a major counter-offensive in coordination. Now they are moving restlessly near Shangjie, and concentrating mortar fire to bombard the Japanese army in Longling, counterattacking day after day, in order to probe the power of the Japanese army. The battle situation in the Longling area has reached an extremely noteworthy stage with the arrival of the dry season.</p>
<p>Japanese Base on the Burmese Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The Chongqing army on the Yunnan side is still actively attempting to open the Burma Road. On the afternoon of the 19th, a powerful unit of the Chongqing army with mortars and Czech machine guns suddenly attacked Zhafang, a key point on the Burma Road. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The Chongqing army failed to achieve its goal of destroying the highway and retreated in defeat, leaving behind many corpses.</p>

More than half of the media and reporting organizations have ceased publication due to the dispersal of journalists and technicians. As for the various schools, they have also been moving to the interior. Among them, Guangxi University, known for its anti-Japanese education, has also moved to Nandan in northwestern Guangxi Province due to the urgency of the war situation. It is reported that it has recently decided to move to Rongjiang in Guizhou Province.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in ○Dutch Territory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) Battles are fierce in the Scheldt River area of northern Netherlands, north of Antwerp, and the Hertogenbosch area. The Canadian First Army and the British Second Army, under the cover of powerful air squadrons, launched an offensive. However, their attempts to break through were all thwarted by the German army. Snow has recently fallen in the Netherlands region, greatly hindering enemy operations. According to front-line news on the 25th, the British Second Army has now entered the area between Hertogenbosch and the Meuse River and is attacking the city of Hertogenbosch from the north. In the western area of the southern Vosges Mountains, German forces in the Mortain area are still bravely resisting the powerful units of the anti-Axis forces.</p>

<h3>Increase Production and Eliminate Speculation with Active Measures</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Jiang Discusses Commodity Price Issues. Industry Minister Jiang Zoxuan recently came to Shanghai to discuss methods with relevant authorities to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to Jiang at his residence, where he was received and answered various questions posed by the reporter. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Q: The soaring commodity prices in the city have greatly affected people's livelihoods. What good measures does the Ministry have to suppress commodity prices?</p>
<p>A: Currently, in order to suppress commodity prices, in addition to strictly enforcing both fundamental and symptomatic measures and cracking down on speculative manipulation, we are also actively researching production countermeasures. If production can be increased, it will not be difficult to lower general commodity prices.</p>
<p>Q: This time you have come to Shanghai to discuss suppressing commodity prices with relevant authorities. I wonder if there will be good results that we can hear about?</p>
<p>A: Currently, the most serious issues are rice, flour, coal, and daily necessities that are directly related to people's livelihoods. The Ministry has already adopted active measures. Regarding rice and flour, we are urging control organizations to increase purchases in various district offices. At the same time, we are assessing commodity prices and strictly cracking down on speculative hoarding. In the future, the crackdown measures will be even stricter.</p>
<p>Q: Is it possible to increase the quantity of rations for various daily necessities?</p>
<p>A: The core of this issue is still to strive for increased production and strict crackdowns in order to suppress commodity prices. The sources of production have now been unblocked, so the general rationing issue is expected to improve in the future.</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign Fully Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>Self-Defense Corps Assists Well. The [Traffic Safety Campaign] organized by the city's police department was fully implemented yesterday (the 26th). All police officers from the Administrative Division's Traffic Section and the administrative sections of various branch bureaus were dispatched and assisted by the Self-Defense Corps to direct traffic at key traffic intersections in various districts. Newspapers and radio stations published or broadcasted key points of traffic regulations and the main points of the traffic safety campaign. Horizontal banners were hung at key traffic intersections. Warning slogans were plastered on various vehicles and the glass display windows of companies, shops, and stores throughout the city. At the same time, the office pre-printed traffic regulations and distributed them to drivers of various vehicles, who were required to strictly comply. Police and Self-Defense Corps members were quite strict in directing traffic, and the situation was very good.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Strictly Prohibits Property Tax Officials from Extorting Money</h3>
<p>The city's Finance Bureau's Property Tax Section staff have been said to demand living subsidies in addition to the regular tax from taxpayers who pay property tax. Director Yuan was furious upon hearing this and immediately issued a strict order to stop it. He also published a notice in the newspaper informing taxpayers to report any such incidents at any time or to take the offenders to the nearest police station for legal action.</p>
<h3>City Economic Bureau Inquires About Rice Prices in Various Counties</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to Oil and Grain Association to Assist in Suppressing Oil Prices. The City Economic Bureau bears the responsibility of stabilizing the people's livelihood and economy during this wartime. At a time when commodity prices are soaring, especially rice prices, it cannot neglect its duties. The Bureau Director Xu Tianshen believes that the soaring rice prices greatly threaten people's livelihoods. It is said that most rice-producing areas have had a bumper autumn harvest this year. In order to understand the actual rice prices in various producing areas, he specifically sent telegrams to the county magistrates of Wuhu, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Liyang to report the latest rice prices for reference. Also, regarding edible oil, the price has recently risen sharply. He specially sent a letter to the Oil and Grain Control Committee requesting it to cooperate in the following aspects to suppress commodity prices: 1. Unblocking sources; 2. Preventing hoarding; 3. Prohibiting waste; 4. Unifying prices. However, the City Economic Bureau's responsibility for supervising the suppression of commodity prices will not be shifted. Reader Assistance News</p>

<h3>Nantong Maru Sinking: Company Dispatches Personnel for Investigation</h3>
<p>All Parties Concerned About the Truth of the Accident. The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Nantong Maru sank near Hupu at 5:15 PM on the 23rd of this month. With the exception of a very small number of the ship's captain and over fifty other officers and over a thousand passengers (including those who bought black market tickets), the situation of the rest remains unknown. This is another tragic case for the company after the Xin Gang Huatai. All sectors of society are paying close attention to the truth of the accident and are watching the company's handling of the aftermath. The Nantong Maru was built in Hong Kong in 1911. It has a flat bottom and a tonnage of 652. It was allocated to the company by the naval authorities. It previously sailed on the Qinglong Port, Tiansheng Port, and Huojiaqiao lines, and was later changed to the Shanghai port line. It had not yet made ten round trips before this disaster occurred. The cause of the accident may be due to excessive loading. It is said that the ship carried over a thousand passengers (mostly carrying pigs, rice, etc.) in addition to 300 bags of wheat, 480 baskets of eggs, and 60 ____ in the hold. Regarding the handling of the aftermath of the case, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Deputy President Yamanaka of China Merchant Steam Navigation Company. According to him, "The loss of the Nantong Maru is not only a loss for the company, but also a loss for both China and Japan. Moreover, the number of victims is quite large. The company will dispatch First Class Reserve Officer Tomi Daiyuki and rescued crew members to the accident site tonight (the 26th) to investigate and salvage."</p>
<h3>Special Consumption Tax to be Paid with Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau was ordered to implement the wartime special consumption tax, starting on January 16 of this year in the Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo and fifteen other important urban areas in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The special consumption tax was levied on retail goods and banquets, hotels, and other items. Subsequently, on April 16, it continued to be levied in various counties, cities, towns, villages, and districts in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The tax administration has gradually progressed to the right track, and tax revenue has been increasing day by day. Until recently, monthly tax revenue has increased to over 30 million yuan. It is now known that the bureau has reported that although the special consumption tax in various regions has been increasing rapidly, there are still merchants and people trying to evade taxes, and the collection process has failed to eliminate malpractices. Therefore, it has specifically requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to prepare for the implementation of a voucher tax payment system in order to increase tax revenue and prevent malpractices. It is said that the voucher tax payment method will be implemented next month once preparations are completed.</p>
<h3>Italian Consulate Celebrates Republic Anniversary Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Regarding the issue of military service and self-defense exemption for teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools in this city, although various schools and bureaus have repeatedly negotiated with the Baojia Office, no resolution has been reached to date. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the Baojia authorities have agreed to exempt teachers and staff of municipal schools, while private schools are limited to one director of moral education. Other teachers and staff are not included in this exemption.</p>

<h3>A Tour of Nanhui</h3>
<p>By Yifei. After days of hard rain, the sun after the rain makes one feel especially beloved. On the 21st of the month, the reporter stepped onto the Huangpu Riverbank in the faint light of dawn. Hired a small boat and crossed to Pudong on the other side. After landing at Dongchang Road, went straight to the East Asia Company's bus station to buy a ticket to Zhoupu. It started shortly after. There were seven people in the same car. Soldiers boarded along the way, but since the car was already full, they all stood on the footboard, one on each side, no different from passengers' obligatory bodyguards. Along the way, traffic flowed back and forth, creating a lively scene. The highway was in disrepair and overloaded, so the car moved like a cow. Otherwise, it would break down. After an hour of travel, it arrived at Zhoupu. Transferred to a large truck of the Shanghai South Bus Company and headed to Nanhui. The car was extremely crowded. Those who arrived later had almost no place to stand. Because the road was slippery after the rain and the road surface was bumpy, the degree of jolting was no different. Passengers could not bear the suffering. However, the ticket seller was able to climb around the car and perform his duties, as nimble as a swallow. The reporter admired this gentleman's skill and sighed at his own inferiority. Arrived at the county seat of Nanhui after noon. The following is a brief report on what I have seen and heard in recent days:</p>
<h3>Inside and Outside the Urban Area</h3>
<p>Nanhui is a small city, only about three li in circumference. The city wall is very low, its height is only like the surrounding wall of a wealthy house in Shanghai. There is a moat outside the city, running around the city. Civilian boats travel back and forth in the river from time to time, dotted among them, set off by the endless green fields. It really makes one forget the mortal world and have a transcendent feeling. The reporter always feels that the beauty of nature is definitely not something that people living in the city can imagine. One must be there to appreciate it. The road administration in Nanhui city is really disappointing. The only so-called main street is not wide, and the houses on both sides are almost connected to each other. The stone slab pavement is uneven, and when it rains, it is like wearing a shoe with a horizontal leather sole, making one sigh "I can't walk anymore, brother." In the small alleys and deep lanes, garbage is everywhere and the stench is overwhelming. Pedestrians cover their noses. In summer, it is even more harmful to hygiene, and it seems that there is a need for rectification. The people here are very simple and honest. In terms of clothing, with the exception of a very small number of outside government officials, there are almost no people wearing western clothes. Everyone wears cloth clothes. They are also very polite to outside travelers, providing assistance in various ways and making it easy for people. It is not comparable to the arrogance of city people who specialize in bullying rural people.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices and the Prevalence of Checks</h3>
<p>General commodity prices are quite high. Except for the specialties of peanuts, sweet potatoes, and fish and shrimp, rice prices are almost the same as in Shanghai, and meat prices are not much different. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes are about 50% more expensive than in Shanghai. Hot water bottles are very popular here, almost every household has one. Because rice straw is expensive, it is not easy to boil water. Even teahouses have to open after noon. With this kind of life, it is no wonder that the general low-paid civil servants here are constantly complaining. The total income of ordinary civil servants is only a quarter of the necessary living expenses. According to the reporter's investigation, most of the patrons of the two pawnshops here are this group of disaster officials. There is another miracle here, that is, the prevalence of checks. Whether it is a small or large transaction or private exchange, checks are used, and the payment period is always more than three or four months. Disputes over bounced checks are unavoidable. However, this trend does not change much because of this. The reason is that those who issue checks are mostly armed or have hidden influence. Merchants dare not refuse to use them. However, everything has its limit. Recently, there has also been a wave of store closures. Even more ridiculous, there are even cases of eating a bowl of wontons and giving the vendor a check for a thousand yuan, asking for change. If the reporter had not seen it with his own eyes, it would be hard to believe.</p>
<h3>Public Security and Rural Conditions</h3>
<p>Nanhui County is divided into eight districts: 1. Chengxiangzhen, 2. Zhuqiao, 3. Liudu, 4. Zhangjiangzha, 5. Zhoupu, 6. Shaojialou, 7. Xinchang, 8. Datuan. In terms of public security, in addition to the above-mentioned large towns, there are traces of guerrillas and bandits in the area within more than ten li nearby. Even on the day the reporter arrived, two guerrillas were arrested in a small boat in the west moat of the city. When the reporter talked to the villagers about this matter, they were very afraid. After 9:00 PM at night, pedestrians disappeared, and only soldiers and police were on the streets. Nanhui County has a total of about 2.4 million mu of farmland, divided into east and west townships. The east township is divided into group and jia systems, while the west township is divided into bao and tu systems. The total population of the county is 525,990, with farmers accounting for the vast majority. Taking the east township as an example, there are 600,000 mu of farmland, divided into seven groups, each group consisting of nine jia. The fields are divided into sugarcane fields and salt fields. Sugarcane fields are further divided into old sugarcane, newly raised, and already enclosed. Due to the current soaring land prices, sugarcane fields are worth 30,000 yuan per mu, newly raised fields are worth 20,000 yuan, and already enclosed fields are worth about 10,000 yuan. Most of the farmers have migrated here from Chongming, Qidong, and Yuyao. Their crops are mainly coarse grains, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and corn. As for cotton, due to the relationship between yield and price, farmers have switched to growing sweet potatoes and other crops. In addition to the land tax of 171 yuan per mu for sugarcane fields and salt fields, and 72 yuan for rice enclosure, they also have to pay military and police rice fees carried by the land tax, amounting to 150 yuan per mu. Other burdensome taxes and miscellaneous taxes such as township business fees, etc., total over 400 yuan per mu. They also have to supply firewood and oil to the military and police. Therefore, due to the heavy burden, farmers are unable to make a living despite their hard work throughout the year. This is a serious problem today.</p>
