<h3>星期評論　論思想對策</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>幾天前，我又接到了一位富於感情衝動的讀者一封下列的信：</p>
<p>「吉田東祐：（請耐着性子，把這封信讀完）哈！哈！你的手段眞不錯，用你那支臭筆想來征服中華民族優秀子孫的心，你避重而就輕，用空話想使中華堂堂大國的人民受你的欺騙，你用糖衣包住的毒藥想毒死中國人民。哈！哈！你的本領勝過前錢的你們的送死鬼萬倍！</p>
<p>但是，你終究失敗了。除了極少數廉恥喪盡的中國人民中的敗類以外，廣大的中國人民都會把你的臭文章拿來揩屁股。你們統治下的上海五百萬人民中有萬分之九千九百九十九，是反對你們的。我勸勸你，還是休息休息吧！如果你還要照舊，那末我們全上海的人民，將要對你不客氣了。馬路上，汽車裹，飯店裹，隨時都可以作為你的歸宿！請自珍重！</p>
<p>中國人民抗日先遣隊第三大隊長應某（署名）</p>
<p>我對這對信感覺興味者，就是這位讀者所犯的邏輯上的矛盾。先在頭一段裹說：「你的手段眞不錯。你的本領勝過前綫的你們的送死鬼萬倍」，這樣過於恭維我的文章了；然而在第二段裹偏又說：「廣大的中國人民都會把你的臭文章拿來揩屁股·告訴你吧！上海五百萬人民中有萬分之九千九百九十九是反對你們的」，這樣一口咬定我不過是單純一個揩屁股紙製造者而已，這是前後如何的矛盾呀？然而問題在於，假如今後我不停止製造揩屁股紙，則將煩勞尊駕，在馬路上，汽車裹，飯店裹，替我找歸宿·這豈不是叉一個大矛盾麼？像我這樣人多起來，揩屁股紙的製造，就可以減少，且假如一般人到廁所裹去，而屁股無紙可揩，人間豈不將臭不可聞麼？我對社會旣這樣不無小補，那末又何必敢勞大駕，暗殺這樣一個人呢？</p>
<p>在中國，竟有這樣糾糾武夫，對於寫揩屁股紙文章的人，都要牛刀小試，橫加干涉，那末無怪乎民國以來，宋敎仁和史量才等許多政治家事業家與政論家，都喪身於暴力之下囉！</p>
<p>一般說來，某一文章所以招致社會的注意者，是該文章涉及到了社會上的某種眞理。很多人常喜歡說，「眞理只有一個」，然而這句話語病很大。實際上，在我們人類所說的正確當中，是有好多階段的。指黑馬而說「那匹馬是黑的」，或者說「那匹黑馬有四條腿」，這兩句話，全都是正確的，然而把這兩句話的眞理性比較一下看，就可以知道後者更正確一些。因為後一句話，更具體地形容著黑馬。反過來說，「那匹黑馬有五條腿」這句話，比較「那匹黑馬沒有腿而有羽翼」這句話是稍微正確的。在許多學者都認為「黑馬有羽翼」的社會裹，縱令有一篇文章說「黑馬有五條腿」，這在那一時代裹，也該算最高級的正確理論吧？因此，假如有人討厭我的文章，那末就請證明一下，「那匹黑馬有四條腿」這句話是否正確，就够了。某種正確性，是只有更大的正確性才能壓倒它的·沒有自信以自己的正確性壓倒對方的正確性的人，只有用暗殺的方法，使對方閉口不言，默爾而息。以暗殺方法，是可以箝制住某種特定個人的言論的，然而發展的眞理，是往往在其他許多人間，發見其擁護者的。歸根結底，眞理是不會被暴力所消滅的·從道德方面來直接感覺這一點，而恰如一種追求正義的力在宇宙間存在着一樣，最典型的例證就是文天祥著的正氣歌。他說：</p>
<p>天地有正氣雜然賦流形下則為河嶽上則為日星于人曰浩然沛乎塞蒼冥……</p>
<p>此外，在明治維新暗殺流行時代，藤田東湖也把維新烈士反抗幕府暴力的眞理追求慾，映現於這偭人類的正氣裹，而歌曰：「天地正大氣，粹然鍾神州……」觀察眞理的這種特性後，孟子稱之為「浩然之氣」。黑格爾的有（Sein）的自己發展，馬克斯的「生產力」，蘭克的道德精力等名稱，也全是指眞理與人類間的這一關係而言的。</p>
<p>這種理論，若談起來是無窮無盡的·如果知道了眞理之為物，是不能被淫威所壓倒的，是只有被更高度的眞理才能壓倒的，那末我們日本方面應付抗戰中國的思想，也應當自動決定於這一原則上。第一，我們日本，必須證明大東亞戰爭理論所包含的眞理，比較重慶的抗日建國理論和延安的抗戰到底理論所包含的眞理，是更高級而更具體的。如用過去那套陳腐眞理，如「中日如兄弟」或「同文同種」之類，是絕對不能對抗民族主義仇恨所武裝的彼等抗戰理論的。無論重慶也好，延安也好，他們抗戰理論，仍然全都是以一九三六年中日事變開始時的客觀形勢為基礎，這就是他們的弱點，因為他們沒有十分理解大東亞戰爭開始後客觀形勢的變化。因此，我們日本和南京政府，必須對準他們這種理論上的弱點，根據「十二八」後的客觀條件，展開眞正亞洲解放的戰爭理論（發表於一文友」一月號的拙著一日本之反省」，就是這種嘗試）。</p>
<p>第二，對於「抗戰份子」，無論在肉體上消滅他們多少，都是毫無意義的。反而對於他們愈用暴力來壓迫他們，則他們在思想上愈發堅强起來。應付思想犯的方法，是必須以更好的思想加以感化和勸導的。日前新行政司法部長張一鵬氏在一個宴會上，會極力主張這一點。我完全同意他這個主張。我認為對付單純的思想犯不應當和殺人罪犯等相提並論，對於思想犯不應當當作犯人看待，最好視之為如需要受訓的學生一樣，只要發見其悔過自新的情緒時，則不問其徒刑是否滿期，宜立刻與以無條件的釋放。假如我們主張的理論是眞理，是比他們的理論史加正確，縱令他們被釋放後還回到抗戰陣營裹去，那末他們就會成為我們理論的最好義務宣傳員，就會成為我們眞理的活動廣吿。</p>
<p>第三，假如我們的理論是正確的，那末我們就無須乎怕眞理和現實。我希望，凡是抗戰論者所提出的問題，都應當准許我們披肝瀝胆，勇敢率直地加以解答。誠然，現在是戰爭時期，統制言論是迫不得已的，然而統制言論就會使言論陷於萎靡頹唐，廢然不振，想發展戰爭理論，實等於緣木求魚。此次世界大戰，可以說，最後結局將決定於各國的戰爭指導理論。假如我們的戰爭理論不發展，就不會使對方的戰爭理論屈服。因此，言論只要在政府當局所指示的方向上，則應當在這一範圍內，盡量開誠佈公，無所忌憚，加以討論。如沒有這種精神的討論，則想發揮戰爭指導理論，眞憂憂乎共難哉。現在抗戰區內，「抗戰八股文」到處橫行，而和平區內，則「和平八股文」氣勢凌人，這二者實際上都是箝制言論過火所致。過於壓迫言論的結果，就產生對付思想的暴力主義者之理論根據。最後，我要奉吿來信讀者一句話。諸位，請放心吧！因為像諸位充滿着矛盾的頭腦，都知道我的文章是糖衣包着毒藥的。然而比諸位更聰明的廣大中國人民，一定也會知道以我文章的毒素，充當良藥的方法。</p>

<h3>印緬邊境殲滅戰　呈迅速進展狀態　日軍遮斷孟多方面敵退路</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電據印緬邊境最前綫電，印緬邊境殲滅戰，頗呈迅速進展，日軍對敵第五·第七兩師結成之包圍圈，已逐漸壓縮，敵軍高級指揮官曾有捨棄部下，企圖搭機脫逃者，而演成　多醜劇。按九日夕刻之綜合戰况，日軍已節節完成包圍圈，敵兩師已陷於被殲滅途，於布其頓西北方，已成袋中鼠之敵軍，自八日午後以來，已陷於仰賴飛機補給食糧與軍火之困境。於歐拉賓（布其頓西北方約八公里）辛澤瓦間之敵軍約千名，載重汽車約百輛，均被日軍完全包圍，敗敵於該地區，已這隨處被日軍逮捕殲滅之苦境，現在馬猶山內，已呈極度激戰狀態。他方由頓左巴札附近，踏破馬猶山系之一日軍有力部隊，會進至孟多那基安央道上，遮斷由孟多方面潰逃之敗敵退路，隨處殲滅頑敵。那基安央橋樑曾被日軍炸毁，今次日軍復進至該道上，以故敗敵脫逃之企圖已陷於絕望，於各地協力日軍勇猛奮戰之印度國民軍，其十氣刻已愈益旺盛。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電據緬甸日軍某基地電，緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊精說，曾於十日上午以戰鬬轟炸機連合大編隊，轟炸馬猶山系西方之敵兵站據點實利山薩，炸毁在該地近郊某河支流架設之軍用橋，幷猛炸該軍用橋兩側密集之敵汽車羣，將敵之退路完全遮斷，日機已全部安返基地。又此次轟炸時，在某河上空曾有敵噴火式機四架飛起擬行邀擊，然見日機大編隊襲來，朱行交戰即狼狽遁去。</p>
<p>緬甸某基地十二日中央社電緬甸方面日陸軍機隊，曾不分書夜猛攻敗敵，九日晨繼以戰鬥機連合若干架之大隊，襲擊布齊敦及孟多，俯衝式機隊發見敵敗走路要衝基地停有汽車貨車約五十　，於是乃行急降下　炸，使之呈大混亂。戰鬥機隊與敵戰門機羣，以　開壯烈空戰，擊落其哈里　機三架，噴水式轟炸機五架，日軍在此次戰鬥中。自爆二架。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電據印度洋日軍前綫某基地電，日海軍機隊。十一日拂曉在加爾各答港口炸毁敵六千噸級運輪船艘，日機於完成任務後，全機安返　防。</p>
<h3>日政府昨通過　國民儲蓄額　本年目標三百六十億</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日藏相賀屋氏，曾於一月二十五日之農院預算總會席上，說明本年度國民貯　額，預料目標為三百五十億元左右，日大藏省於本月九日開會時，攷慮各種情形後，特决定為三百六十億元，並草就案件，呈遞政府。茲日政府於十二日提前召開閣議時討論該案，由藏相說明理由後，即一致將原案通過，於此日政府正式決定本年度國民貯蓄目標額為三百六十億元。幷於是日下午由情報局予以發表，按日國民貯蓄目標額自　利十三年以來如次：十三年八十億元，十四年一百億元，十五年一百二十億元·十六　一百七十億元，十七年一百三十億元，十八年二百七十億元，十九年三百六十億元，</p>
<h3>敵機襲盤谷</h3>
<p>盤谷十十日中央社電敵機十餘架，十日夜十時牛來襲盤谷市，日·泰兩軍戰鬥機及防空砲火，當行猛烈迎擊，敵機倉惶投下炸彈後，即行遁去·地上受損極微。</p>
<h3>傳渝方　將遷都成都</h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電據重慶電台廣播稱，渝當局現　遷都成都，已據妥計劃，决着手建設該市工事云。</p>

<h3>中南太平洋方面　日海軍機隊活躍　侵襲渥普賽島敵艦被擊退</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，日木海軍機隊·連日於南太平洋方面極爲活躍，茲誌詳情如次：　十日晟曾襲擊摩諾島之敵機塲，炸中其滑行路，是役，日機一架未返，　十日晟曾猛炸特魯基納之敵陸上設施，十一日晟復轟炸該地敵機塲，日機兩次均安返·　十日上午於新幾內亞布那，炸毀敵大型運輸船一艘，日機安返，十日下午於芬希哈罕曾炸毀敵大型運輸船一艘。十一日晟幷曾連炸該港，使敵小型運輸船一艘中彈起火，日方無損害。　日海軍機隊曾於十一日晟連績兩次轟炸新不列顚島次爲布敵機塲，使其一處大爆發，一處起火，日方無損害。　日海軍機隊，曾於十一日晟於新幾內亞島芬希哈罕方面，擊毀敵大型運輸船兩艘及舟艇四艘，日方無損害。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據中部太平洋方面日軍基地電，敵軍對馬紹爾羣島之侵攻，雖日益積極，但迭次均爲日軍擊退。十日夜敵又以統一式B24型轟炸機五架及騙遂艦來犯馬羅危拉布環礁之塔羅阿島，幷以砲擊日軍陣地，經該島日守備隊痛擊後，即行竄去，是役日方損害輕微。又敵巡艦及騙逐艦數艘，曾於十日晟砲擊渥普賽島，經日軍守備部隊與之交戰後，即行竄退，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電，馬紹爾羣島渥普賽島之日陸海軍守備隊，曾於十日邀擊來襲之敵B24型機數架，當即擊落其一架，日方毫無損失。</p>
<h3>淸鄉會議席上　前田中將演詞　—太平洋戰局與美國</h3>
<p>中央社京訊　（續昨）以下引用的統計數字，大半都是敵方所發表的：</p>
<p>戰艦開戰時所有數一入開戰後就役數四開戰後喪失數四—六現有數（修理中）一三—一二（五—四）</p>
<p>航空母艦七　○　五一（一）</p>
<p>特殊設空母　二　一七　二　（七）</p>
<p>甲級巡洋艦一八　○一○　五（三）</p>
<p>乙級巡洋艦九八五　一一（一）</p>
<p>輕巡　一○　四　四一○</p>
<p>騙逐艦　一八五　八五　三一　三二　（八）</p>
<p>潛水艦　一一八　三四　三七　九五（二○）</p>
<p>由此看，我們就可以知道，他們美國在一夏威夷海戰」，與「珊湖海海戰」，以及「中途島海戰」等所受的損失甚大·就拿艦艇損失而說，也有整一百隻，飛機的損失，那可以千數之多了。但是我心　謀急速增強生產力，而努力補充這種損失的情形。</p>
<p>他們自己跨張發表美國生產力，已在去年間差不多到了極點，與戰爭以前比較增加幾倍了等話，但是據情報說，他們造兵艦的時間也極端縮緊了。他們從前造一隻戰艦總要五年的功夫，現在呢，就有三年可以成功的。又如航空母艦是從前要三年的，現在只要十七個月。騙逐艦則比從前以三分之一的功夫就可以造成。造潛水艦也只有比從前三分之一的功夫就够的了。他們這樣增强了生產力，我們由此容易想傑他們早在戰前，所擬的大規模之造艦計劃，也已着着終於實現的。據情報也說，該計劃是以造成航空母艦爲重點等等的話。講到海軍飛機的話，他們在戰前只有一萬五千架的計劃，但據去年夏期所發表過的數目，增爲二萬七千架之多了。因爲他們在去年爲實行此等計劃，似有排除一切的困難和障害而努力的樣子，所以到現在，其海軍的實力已經到了不可輕視的程度了。</p>
<p>自去年秋期以來，他們就以其增加的實力，自所羅門諸島方面，吉爾貝特馬紹爾方面等，陸績的開始猛烈的反攻。</p>
<p>那麼以後美國能不能長久維持現在的生產力，而補充損失之兵力，繼續反攻下去呢？我們先就其根本間題的美國資源，工業力，以及人員等，加以研究，不過因爲沒有充分的時間，所以兄弟現在只以重要的部份購一購。</p>
<p>關於資源，他們美國雖然說是世界上頂豐富的國家，但橡皮，錫　，探司登，鋼精等這一類的東西，在戰前還得　由東亞方面　買來的·開戰以來，他　們就不能够輸入此種物資，所以現在感覺困難起來了。但是這些缺乏之物質，如果能够以人造橡皮，儲藏品，收回品，代用品等敷衍下去，也沒有什麼大影響似的。就工業力而諭，可以判斷大約到了極點了。據去年十月間的統計，其一年間的生產力，就是飛機十萬餘架，戰車六萬輛，汽車五萬三千輛，卡車一百一十萬輛，輸船二千萬頓，兵艦三百萬頓，並且他們技術方面也有相當的進步。不過他們現在人的資源不充分的時候，關於高　的熟練工人的供給，恐怕是不好解决的，這一點就成爲車大的問題了。總之，在美國目前最大的問題，就是人的資源的問題，前年羅斯福大總統自己也說過，「我們現在最大的因難，就是缺乏人的資源的問題」。去年年底，美國人口總數，就是一萬萬三千四百萬左右，其中十四歲以上六十五歲以下的，認爲人的資源者，大約能有九千三百五十萬左右。那麼去年所需要的人員數目一，大約就是：</p>
<p>軍隊　一千萬人</p>
<p>其他軍事上需耍的　二千萬人</p>
<p>民間需用的　二千萬人</p>
<p>農村需要的　八百萬人</p>
<p>其他需耍的　五百萬人</p>
<p>總　計　六千三百萬人</p>
<p>若是就由數字的方面看起來，好像還有三千萬的餘裕，其實因爲身體不健康，而不能從事工作的，或者是有其他的事情，不能離開家庭的等等，也有相當的數目。所以其三千萬人的餘裕數目，不能完全是預備的數目。在本年度，各方面更需要增加人員，是勢所必然的。我們由此觀之，其人的資源，可以說是已經到了極點了。</p>
<p>原來是一個極端的女尊男卑的國家的美國，現在已經公布了女子登記法案。</p>
<p>而去年年底從事於工廠勞働的女子，已經有了二百萬的多了。由此看起來，就可以知道美國的戰力，已經大約到了最大的限度了。</p>
<p>但是把這個戰力，究竟能够維持到甚麼時候呢？說到這一點，我們看美國所有的人的資源，和其巨大的消耗情形而論，也許是本年間，或者是明年間，就到關頭的罷。並且在美國國內準備好的這些戰力，若是　他在前綫發揮力量·非得將其運輸不可的、說到這運輸的問題，美國的運輸距離，比我國的運輸距離遠的兩倍以上了，這對於美國更加上不利的條件了。</p>
<p>現在敵方的反攻，雖然日日熾烈起來，但是剛才兄弟已經說過他們戰力的程度，現在我們巳經看的明白了。所以我方不但有充分的把握，將他擊滅粉碎，而且人的資源方面，也比他們豐富得多了。現在東亞十萬萬的人民，若是能修一致團結起米，則在全世界上沒有一個可以抵抗我們的，再講資源問題，敵方的生產力，兄弟剛才已經說過，現在已經到了極點了。但我方的生產力，比他順利得很·現在一天比一天的發展起來哩。</p>
<p>中國自從參加大東亞戰爭以後，直到現在，擔任供給資源的重大使命。</p>
<p>淸鄉工作對於供給資源，直接的有甚大關係。現在諸位閣下以異常之努力與苦心，邁進於淸鄉工作之完遂，而日見收其效果，兄弟衷心實甚欽佩。尤爲慶賀的，諸位旣然如此的專心努力於淸鄕工作，不但是增加中國國家與人民的利益，而且對於我方的戰爭力量，直接的有所貢獻，而此爲中國協助大東亞戰爭的車大要紫。鑑此，現在兄弟希望淸鄕工作，將來更爲順利光輝的進展擴大，同時懇請諸位閣下，以後進一步努力，去作以完成這偉大的工作，是所切盼的。</p>
<p>好多時間，承蒙諸位閣下靜聽，感謝得很。現在兄弟之講演完了（完）</p>
<h3>羅馬以南防禦　已大見增強　羅斯福承認局勢緊張</h3>
<p>卡西諾十二日中央社電　據海通社戰地記者匯柏報吿稱，自美第五軍在卡西諾區開始進攻以來·已歷二十日，但卡西諾山及該地馬覆山之最高峰開洛山依然在德軍手中·美軍不能奪取馬覆山，當不能與在納吐諾登陸之反軸心軍取得聯絡。至于凱賽林元帥則已達到其遷延時日之目的，在過去數進間羅馬以南之防禦，業已大加增强，敵人欲獲寸進，必須付重大代價。在卡西諾一帶有德義克雜特以及俄志願兵工人忙於築造工事，過去數日，山間之溫度抵至攝氏零下十五</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據前綫消息，優勢之德軍曾對周圍五十公里之納吐諾橋頭堡施以猛烈攻擊，自十一日晟以來，又突破反軸心陣地數處，故橋頭堡之反軸心軍刻巳陷於全滅之危境。反軸心軍刻正待卡西諾方面美第五軍主力來援，故繼續抗戰。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據美方息，羅斯福總統昨在情報會議中稱：反軸心軍在羅馬以南橋頭之軍事局勢甚爲緊張，渠希望天氣好轉，以助反軸心軍在海濱陣地之海陸軍事。</p>
<h3>聶伯河　下游劇戰</h3>

<p>柏林十二日中央社電　海通社量後軍訊，蘇軍於過去二十四小時中，又在維特勃斯克區發動猛攻城西北及東南，蘇軍猛攻竟日，均未能突破。東綫北路魯加區及貝伯斯湖以東，蘇軍亦行猛攻，德軍報以反攻，將敵逐回。蘇軍欲岡突入魯加與貝伯斯湖間森林沼澤區之計劃卒無從實現。</p>

<h3>英要求在土　設空軍基地</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　開羅地稱：英軍司令部當局十一日發表：英國與土耳其當局，爲協商作戰問題，已於五週前在開羅賡績舉行會議，泰晤士報駐土京特派員聲稱：此項會商，因雙方缺乏誠意，故已呈停頓狀熊。傳英政府於此次會談中，雖維持土政府之中立，但强硬要求在土國內建設反軸心空軍基地。</p>
<p>安加拉十二日中央社電　據海通社訊：五星期前抵中東之英軍事代表團，現已離土京。據開羅路透社通訊員評稱：反軸心國及土耳其政治家在開羅之會商，在某數方面雖有結果，但土耳其似尙不願反軸心國在土境建立軍事根據地。</p>

<h3>歐洲要塞的攻防戰　（五）</h3>
<p>伊比利亞半島的動向</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　英美如欲進攻西歐作戰從西方包圍德國，勢必將伊比利亞半島的西·葡二中立國拉入反軸心陣綫，英美對該兩國施以威嚇利誘，欲拉攏之使加入反軸心方面者，其理由即在於此。伊比利亞半島最近的情形如何？</p>
<p>伊藤特派員（瑪德里）中立國者，視戰局的動向如何而行動的浮游動物。英美對此地的政治經濟謀略，雖相當激烈，但西班牙仍站在反軸心方面，而其鄰國葡萄牙則取親英美的態度。英美的伊比利亞工作，今專從政治的立塲出發。有人以爲英美　於在北法開第二戰綫的困難性，乃擬在伊比利亞半島試行登陸戰。但這不過是傳說，然假使歐洲登陸失敗，則爲了面子問題，或許要在此方面登陸。英國運輸武器到葡萄牙，就是爲此。英葡交涉中，已經可以看出企圖將此方面使用爲登陸部隊的兵站基地，傷兵收容等的後方基地。但這二個國家絕對不會加入戰爭。最多略爲讓步，敷衍過去。</p>
<p>茂木特派員（里斯本）　葡萄牙與其鄰國西班牙，對於歐洲戰局的發展，極爲敏感，這一點與別的中立國相同。外交上的些微蹉跌，有關國家存亡·所以歐洲所有的中立國，都取騎牆主義。而這二國的意思，如其可能，總想維持現在的中立。成爲間題的是英美的惡毒的活動。自從英美在北非登陸後，西班牙從「非交戰國」轉變爲「嚴守中立」，但去年菲島獨立時，曾發賀電，幷發生襲擊英美領事館事件，對英美漸表憤怒。</p>
<p>但另一方面，召還參加柬戰綫的藍色師團，最近的解散佛朗軍隊，法朗哥的稱讚南國游擊隊首領契特的演說等，也似乎在討好英美。葡萄牙的情形與西班牙不同者，第一，與英國締結同盟條約。被一般人所遺志的該條約，至去件突然表面化，成爲供給英美阿索萊斯空軍根據地的理由。對於薩拉柴爾首相嚴守中立的希望，誰也無疑，但薩拉柴爾所說「英葡條件以葡萄牙的中立爲條件」的話，因阿索萊斯事年而更明瞭。</p>
<p>英國今從在自身必要的塲合，隨時得以任意引用這條約。</p>
<p>與西班牙不同的第二點，是以蒂木爾島問題爲中心的對日問題。然關於這問題，最近薩拉柴爾已很理解日木的誠意。</p>
<p>要之，伊比利亞兩國的中立，從兩國支配者之主觀的立塲出發，其影響力少；全視戰局的發展，英美如何活動，而影響到該兩國的地位。</p>
<p>義大利戰綫</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　在英美沒有展開巴爾幹作戰的今日，義大利戰錢是反軸心軍從南攻擊德國唯一的中心。最近已見激化的義大利戰綫之現狀如何？</p>
<p>衣奈特派員（羅馬）關於現在的戰況，即使英國方面也沒有滿足的情報。英美廣播德方的報道說「敵占領阿比亞街頭的要衝威萊托利」，完全是毫無根據的事實。至於南部山岳地帶的戰鬥狀況，分局的淸水君最近曾視察戰綫請聽淸水君的報吿。</p>
<p>淸水特派員（羅馬）</p>
<p>我此次費了八天的時間，全部行程約一千公里，東面曾到渦阿特里亞海沿岸離敵陣數公里的地點。並曾立在拔海二千米以上積雪寒風的阿卑寗山頂，眼下見到敵的蠢動情形，具體視察德軍最前綫。戰綫目前從阿特里亞海奧爾特那港起，至契萊尼阿海明茲爾諾止·約一百六十公里。與一個月前的戰綫比較起來，央美軍變更共配置如次：</p>
<p>以伊塞爾尼亞的西北約二千公里的庇索諾爲境，東爲李斯麾下的英第八軍，西爲克拉克麾下的美第五軍，仍如前一樣。英第八軍第一綫的配置，從阿特里亞海起爲加拿大第一師國，印度第八師團。英第五師團，新西蘭第一師團，最後爲英第七十八步兵師團。此外，在後方有巴陀里奧軍約一聯隊。</p>
<p>有着數倍於德軍兵力的敵人，到今日殆陷於不能　進的狀態，共理由爲德軍的防禦陣地是占地利的高地，並由於德軍將士的英勇奪鬥，致敵軍前進受挫。戰區的義大利民衆，很盡力協助德軍，義兵亦當先奮戰。（翔：譯自二月二日至三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>部長答詞</p>
<p>旋由演田部長致詞天特別爲了我們兩人舉行如此盛大茶會，鄱人謹表十二分謝意，梁先生剛才說　會很簡單，實在太客氣了，鄙人前年一月來滬，過了差不多兩年，在兩年中承蒙各方面多多協力，實在非常感激。自去年八月交還租界後，中日兩國合作更趨密切。而且鄙人在滬得到多位先生之協力，共同推進大東亞建設，此次離滬，常隨時想起各位之好意。新任松平部長，已由梁先生介紹，他在中國時候很久，故今後對中日兩國成之宣傳報道工作，必更有進展云。耀由松平部長致詞，略謂：因時關係，所以簡單說幾句話，兄弟此次奉命來滬工作，以後與各位工作相同，担任宣傳事業，兄弟在二月三月兩個月，準備與各方權威名流交換意見，四月起開始新工作計劃，希望大家注重實行，另外兄弟認爲做事應有誠懇坦白的態度，不應有絲毫虛偽。末由周事務局長致詞。直至六時，賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>文化交流的發軔</h3>
<p>— 修僑</p>
<p>興亞造形文化展覽會參觀記</p>
<p>日本與亞造型文化聯盟最近主辦興亞造形文化展覽會，欲以造形文化爲媒介，對於大東亞建設有所貢獻，特集中日本的造形力量，以便在中日兩國的文化上作第一步的交流。</p>
<p>該會揭藥其旨趣曰：「一國的文化，實爲該國家精神與生命之顯現，而其中之造形文化，尤爲其國民傳統與創造精神最顯著而具體的表現，在其建築或工藝上所表現者。即爲該民族無法抑壓造形力之發露。中國自古以來，就是一個建築與工藝的國家，富有優秀的造形力及技術的傳統，其影響竟遍達於全世界之各地。而日本，在其擊國以來的造形文化上也廣收世界的精粹，而開拓獨待之途徑，形成一種日本的藝術文化·」又說：「中日之間，自古以來，即在各部門中，有極廣泛的文化交流，兩國之歷史與民族，亦各別形成特異的傳統，以至今日，在確立大東亞共榮圈的現階段，欲使東亞軸心中日兩國之完全理解與協力，中日兩國之完全融合，非由兩國文化之全面交流不可。」於此，可見造形文化，在文化交流上重要性的一班。</p>
<p>展覽會之會塲在外　興亞大樓四樓，陳列作品，均係遠去及規在日本美術工藝的代表作。於此對於日本造形文化，可以得到一個具體的概觀。</p>
<p>陳設作品，每一種，每一物，無不製作精緻，巧奪天工。其中香取秀眞氏的「狡猊鈕香爐」，俘蠟型鑄造，乃以寗　製成原型，包以傳砂然後熔化實　鑄入鎔解靑銅，故其容姿端正，極具古典風味，香取秀眞氏爲帝國　　院會員，作品極多，公認爲日本工藝界之指導者·「風恬月朗」。係一鑄鋼美人奏笛，用靑銅鑄造，上面刻有中國古詩，式樣古雅，極堪玩味，作者津田信夫，亦爲　術院會員，性情沉　堅實，從作品中可以窺見，現被推爲日本鑄金界巨擊。「平和瑞雲硯匣」，係漆器，此種技藝，日本稱爲「高蒔繪」，即泥金漆畫，乃以漆畫出草圖，敷以金銀泥粉，反復途上，研磨而成，製作精緻絕倫，爲二木成抱氏所作，氏對於蒔繪技法極精，故稱爲日本漆藝界之異才。「牡丹手盒」亦係漆器，用漆和顏料混和，使用銀漿等製成，盒上繪彩色牡丹，鮮艷奪目，用以藏詩歌及文奉等，作者高井白陽，亦爲日本漆　界名家·「對，係一鐵質之炻器，將表面削成八面，再以化學方法使發　紅色，色樣大方而富魔，爲日本陶藝界巨　大森光彥氏所作，其豪放作風，世所公認。「天人文花瓶」，用黑銅鍛造，外鐫人物雲彩，花樣及刻書之技法，均極暢達，式樣古雅樓茂，作者淸永龜藏氏，精金工技術，爲現代日本離金界宗匠·其他精品各有佳處，不勝枚舉·其標價最低者爲三千元，最高者爲四萬元。</p>
<h3>第十期戶口糖　明日起發售　糖商營業處發表調整價格</h3>
<p>第一區公署昨佈告云自本年二月十四日起至二十四日止，市民得憑第十號買糖聯票，領購食糖，零售店於收到每張標明該店號數之該號聯票時，應出售白糖五市兩，價共國幣八元一角正，　電包裝，另行加費，不需者聽，零售捐豁免，再本佈吿不適用於新併入本區之滬西轄境內。</p>
<p>規定發售</p>
<p>辦法五項</p>
<p>上海糖商合作營業處，爲第十期計口授糖，特規定下開辦法，希各經售商店，及食戶一體知照。　凡在第一區（包括舊第八區）及南市。滬西·徐華坊·閘北·市中心區·龍漕鎭·浦東南·浦東北等處者，均普遍憑證發售。　每紙購糖證，華人憑購精白糖或次白糖市秤五兩，計售中錯券八元一角，猶太人憑購粗砂糖市秤十兩，計售中儲券十六元二角，西人憑購粗砂糖市秤二十兩，計售中儲券三十二元四角，均連購糖證紙張費在內。（零售捐均豁免），食戶購糖，須自帶盛器，如須包紮。另行加費。　本期購糖證有效期間，自二月十四日起至二十四日止，一逾期作廢。　猶太人之配給糖，指定二○六號東南福，二○七號明治屋，二○八號大來發售。　各經售商店均應照章辦理，各食戶領　時，須眼同過秤，倘有私抬便格，減少分量，或攙水攙雜情事，各食戶可向本處報吿，（舊第八區洋行街彤變街二十三號），或就近向警務機關報告，以憑查究。</p>
<p>調整糖價</p>
<p>增旺來源</p>
<p>第十期戶口糖，現經上海糖商合作營業處，商陳有關當局，文配就緒，業已定期發售，惟當局爲節制物賓起見，故規定華人配給，較上期減去一兩，猶太人配給，減去二兩，西人配給，減去四兩不等。至售價提高，據該處發言人云，實有不得已之苦衷，蓋自大東亞戰爭發生後，華商存糖，均集中公售，施行配給以來，悉遵限價，雖各項物價送次高漲，而糖商方面，仍忍痛維持低價，較之其他物品，殊失平衡，此爲社會人士所共悉，現在參加公售人，以本身存糖，行將售　，所有按期　還之貨本，在此生活高　之下，業已賠貼殆盡，採購能力，因而薄弱，以現在進價計之，則浙江之土糖，運滬成本，每百斤須合國幣七八千元，較之上期戶口糖售價，超過達十倍之多，若不及時補救，則糖商勢必完全失去採購能力，一旦接濟中斷，民食堪虞，爲維持採購能力，以增來源計，故陳請當局，將糖價重行調整，經各當局再三考慮後，認爲本實如此，確屬必要，故此次准予調整，以冀充沛來源，該發言又云，此次調整之價格，與土糖進價比較，尚不及其三分之一，蓋仍頤及消費者之負担耳。</p>
<h3>市市配給物品　禁私自掉換</h3>
<p>南市全區日用必需物品，實施計口配給制度以來，旨在減輕該區市民生活負擔，戢止黑市非法交易。乃查少數指定商店，竟有私自抬價，或將配給物品，另行掉換，殊堪痛恨。市保甲委員會爲切實防社計，已與市經濟同商定，令飭南市保甲辦事處一，及該管同業公會，轉知各承配商店，絕對不得違背規定，私自掉換，如有故違，一經查實，定予嚴懲，以肅刁風。</p>
<h3>市民獻機運動　昨舉行常會</h3>
<p>上海特別市民衆獻機委員會，昨下午三時舉行常會，到常委劉仰山·翦建午·朱鼎等，由常委　仰山致詞，希全體市民，一致踴躍奮力輸將，以期共同完成獻機，而該會爲求各界　信起見，凡各項捐款，均擬逐次在報端刋載，以昭大公云云。國即討論通過耍案多項。</p>

<h3>（一）龜海　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>「若見不到谷的時候，到八方園或參考館去就可以找到了」。在分隊中問有這樣的口頭禪，可知他是時常到八方園和參考館去的。敎育參考館，從前就在學生館內、在眞人入學的前後，重新建築了一所像東京的海軍館般的，華麗的新古典派石造的大樓。像這種設備，據說是英國的「答特瑪斯海軍學校」和米國的「阿那波里斯的海軍學校」也沒有。</p>
<p>價人見着敎官們，通過敎育館前時，必定要行體後纔過去。館內有帶血痕的戰死者的衣服，雕刻着卒業生戰死公死奢名字的大理石的名牌，廣　中佐和佐久間潛水艇長的遺筆，往昔的水軍和兵法的史料——以及其他，記錄着日本海軍之名譽和傳統的資料等，充滿全館，但是眞人終於知道了敎官們行禮時注目的方向。</p>
<p>那便是從正門中央台階上去，在正面的東鄕元帥室。中央有元師的遺髪，在那旁邊有全身的肖儏，嵌在墻壁上。曾運過他的墳土的，鄉軍的老前輩，用嚴肅的慈顏，俯視着眞人。</p>
<p>進到這個屋裏來，眞人感覺着好像有一種靈感附上身來似的躊躇難離。又好像眞人所探求的東西，都在這裏合成一起，鑄成了一塊珠玉，安置在那裏似德。</p>
<p>「元帥把日本海軍的傳統精神，通諸一生，顯現無遺。整們的海軍精神，在元帥的言行襄漾　着。勇猛無比的提督，明智如神的名將，在日本的海軍中，是數不勝數的，但是一身體騐了海軍軍人的理想和典型，自古來唯有元帥一個人。元帥是日本海軍精神的象徵。海眾軍人絕對的規範。我們無論何時何地，都不要忘了師事元帥……」</p>
<p>眞人仔細地看著陳列箱裏元帥年靑時的美麗的照片，無數的勳章，以及英國留學時代整然地英文物理學筆記等，對於元帥的崇拜，越發激昻起來了。利用星期出外去的時間，坐在館內圖書室裏，耽讀着東鄕元帥詳傳。</p>
<p>眞人不但知道了高陞號事件，日本海海戰J字戰法等，元的的果斷。聽到初潮八島艦的沈沒而聲色不動的沈着，抱着决不靠近馬的後腿的細心，在日本海海戰第二天也會行了訓練的愼重，而且那沈默，議讓和質素——一切的一切，都是眞人所理想得到的名將的條件。元帥是這樣偉大的人物，眞人從來是沒有得到具體的了解的。</p>
<p>「我也希望像元帥那樣地生活方法，然而……」</p>
<p>在無條約時代的海軍學生，並沒有打算活到元帥那樣高夀的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>勿論甚麼，速成是不行的。一知半解是絕對要禁戒的。</p>
<p>雖然十這麼說，但是爲使四華生們學習校歌的「江田島之歌」而特從吳市派軍樂隊前來，眞人却以爲太鄭重其事了。</p>
<p>晚飯後軍歌的時間，初夏的晚霞，操塲上的細草，軍樂隊的白制服，也都看得很淸楚的。</p>
<p>先反復的奏了數次的音樂後，敎師表演着正確的唱法——無論在音樂上，或氣力上，都以爲正確的標準的唱法。並不像高等學校那種用蠻勁歌唱就可以的。</p>
<p>波濤洶湧的大洋</p>
<p>巨浪滔天的地方</p>
<p>最初的一節，巳經開始了，可是提起唱歌來，是從小學時代以來就不得意的，眞人最感困難的，就是不能儘量地發出聲音來。現在已經是不許可你敷衍了事地唱唱就可以了的。所以他便不　羞恥和體面的，高聲發出那不成調的聲音。</p>
<h3>社會服務　節省燒飯燃料辦法</h3>
<p>爲節省三餐燒飯燃料及時間起見，介紹一方法如下：以破舊衣服舊棉被等重疊織成一厚窩，如鳥窩狀，周圍愈厚愈佳，如有空皮箱或木箱之類亦可。將所製成之窩，放在箱中，最好四周要不留空隙，上面更用類似舊棉織品，另製一蓋，大小與窩相配。至於窩中之容量，深淺大小，與所備用飯鍋之尺度應相稱。</p>
<p>比方每田早晨七八小時燒飯，即利用燒飯後所殘留爐火或稍加些燃料，立即將預先淘過的米和水貯在另一備便的鍋，放在爐上燒，燒時可不必待其完全熟透，只要見水已沸，米粒放長，即將鍋蓋提起，立刻放入所備暖窩中。然後把棉布蓋罩好，上下四週緊密地塞着，置於不通風之處威小房間亦可，兼資取暖之用。直至午飯取食，鍋蓋一開，飯汽蒸騰，熱度比爐上剛燒好的飯不相上下，而氣味夕香飯，粒粒軟潤，殊有過無不及，旣省費又省力，一舉兩得。</p>
<p>此乃就冬天氣候寒冷時而言，倘氣候稍暖或夏令，如依此辦法則鍋中熱度最起碼可保留至十二小時以上，如是則每天儘可就早晨生火一次燒飯，午晚兩餐可不必生火用膳，若要並及保留各小菜羹湯之熟度，亦可倣此，多製幾售暖窩應用。至於如家中破舊棉織品，不够備用，可以一兩件舊短衫，俟飯將成熱時，立將飯鍋取起包好，放在床上被窩中，　圍緊密封塞，亦無不妥。此乃本人經騐之談，希望大家一試。（言午）</p>

<h3>招待新闻界席上　醫界代表的演詞</h3>
<p>余雲岫詞（續）</p>
<p>剛才顧南羣先生所舉一個瀕死小兒的例子，醫師爲他打强心針之後，病兒仍舊死去。病家於是乎不加審衡，就認某醫師臨症上診斷的錯誤，鄙人以爲這件事，有先决問題存在。第一，醫師突然接受了瀕死的病人，不先用强心針來維持一下，是不是有診察的餘暇。第二，强心針是不是能打死人。第三，肺管白喉是不是立刻可以診斷出來。第四，臨　診斷之和解剖上不相符合是不是某醫師特別疏忽的錯誤。若是就此可以把醫師抵罪，那末世界最高學府裏最有名的醫學家，非天天在牢裏不可，假使這種風氣不去矯正，恐怕往後要發生許多不幸的事情。</p>
<p>第一，醫師磋著危急萬分的病人，元　後患，不敢施行應急手術。病人的生命，就發生莫大的危險。第二·研究醫學的人，都灰心起來，自已做了醫生，沒有路道，去改行業，誰願意再敎子弟去學醫。本來醫學不甚發達的我國，將來非弄得更落伍不幸。第三，現在我國社會本來大多數還看輕視科學的態度。若是一國文化先鋒的醫學，先遭　敗，輕視醫學的心，更加厲害，科學是永遠不會發達的。任他天天落伍，倒退下去，不但國家的體面有關，將來的危險，是不堪設想的。</p>
<p>今朝光臨的報界諸君，都是我國的知識份子。務請主持正義，領導社會，向　莊大道邁進，這是鄙人所希望的。</p>
<p>顏福慶詞</p>
<p>今天三團體代表本市以及全國醫界，招待新聞界諸君，其原因以邇來醫師與病家間時有糾紛發生，此其結果，對於醫界及病人，均屬不利。爲謀解決此種不利事件起見，我醫界同人，　有審查會之組織，就醫學之立塲，作公正之評斷，其審查結果，一面請求法院採納，以憑判决，一而提供社會參考，以申公論。</p>
<p>目前一部份業醫者，所予社會之印象亦殊不良：缺乏服務之精神，一味以金錢爲目的，貧病尤有侯門難入之慨，此種醫師之缺乏道德觀念，不熊諱言。最近醫界同人，籌設衛生實騐區，其目的即在使一般醫師　餘之暇，得有機會爲平民服務。至於不良份子，利川職業機會，欺詐取財，自當請求當局，嚴加取締懲處。</p>
<p>以言乎醫，可分爲兩都份。即醫學與醫業，新醫爲科學化之醫學，不分國界，而以所有正確有效之發明，公之於世，然其進步，至於尙屬有限，疾病中之有確定療法者，尙屬少數，其有正確之診斷方法與有效之預防方法，而無確實之　法者，實居多數，甚至診斷錯誤者，亦時所不爭。根據美國最高醫學府哈佛大學醫學院中歷年　床診斷與屍體剖檢診斷比較結果，其兩相符合去，不過百分之三十·診斷之難概可想見。</p>
<p>醫業之發展，隨社會之需求而轉移，民衆　以爲醫可以金錢購買，即將多營業化之醫生，營業化之醫生，忽略診察聞方了事。醫事其尙堪間聞乎，更因志在營業，於是新醫以血淸冶療白　，以六○六治療梅毒，功效確著，而近時舊醫　有用之者。然以不明醫理，施用每多乖誤，反　貽害病人，深望新聞界與醫學界協力，作普及　藥常識之工作，不特醫界之幸，抑亦社會之福也</p>
<p>中華醫學會醫師公會及醫院聯合會三團體曾於上月二十日，招待本市新聞界，席間由醫師代表顧南羣。顏福慶。余雲岫三氏，發表演說，頗具價値，常時未加詳記，茲特將全文補刋如上。　編者附註</p>

<h3>Weekly Review: On Ideological Countermeasures</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Togo</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received another letter from an emotionally charged reader. Here is the letter:</p>
<p>"Yoshida Togo: (Please be patient and read this letter to the end) Ha! Ha! Your methods are truly remarkable. Using that foul pen of yours, you seek to conquer the hearts of the outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation. You avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, using empty words to deceive the people of the grand nation of China. You use sugar-coated poison to kill the Chinese people. Ha! Ha! Your abilities surpass those of your frontline cannon fodder ten thousand times over!</p>
<p>However, you will ultimately fail. Apart from a tiny number of shameless dregs among the Chinese people, the vast majority of the Chinese people will use your foul articles to wipe their buttocks. Let me tell you, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand of the five million people in Shanghai under your rule oppose you. I advise you to take a rest! If you continue as before, then all the people of Shanghai will be impolite to you. On the streets, in cars, in restaurants, you could meet your end at any time! Please take care!</p>
<p>A Certain Person Ying, Third Detachment Leader of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Vanguard (Signature)"</p>
<p>What I find interesting about this letter is the logical contradiction committed by this reader. First, in the first paragraph, he says, "Your methods are truly remarkable. Your abilities surpass those of your frontline cannon fodder ten thousand times over," which is an excessive compliment to my articles. However, in the second paragraph, he insists, "The vast majority of the Chinese people will use your foul articles to wipe their buttocks. Let me tell you, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand of the five million people in Shanghai oppose you," thus categorically stating that I am merely a manufacturer of toilet paper. How contradictory is this? However, the problem lies in the fact that if I do not stop manufacturing toilet paper in the future, I will trouble you to find me a resting place on the streets, in cars, and in restaurants. Isn't this another great contradiction? If there are more people like me, the manufacturing of toilet paper could be reduced, and if people go to the toilet and have no paper to wipe their bottoms, wouldn't the world become unbearably smelly? Since I am not without some small contribution to society, why bother to assassinate someone like me?</p>
<p>In China, there are such fierce warriors who want to test their skills on those who write toilet paper articles, interfering arbitrarily. No wonder many politicians, entrepreneurs, and political commentators, such as Song Jiaoren and Shi Liangcai, have lost their lives to violence since the founding of the Republic!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, an article attracts social attention because it touches upon some truth in society. Many people often like to say, "There is only one truth," but this statement has a major flaw. In reality, there are many stages in what we humans consider correct. To point at a black horse and say, "That horse is black," or to say, "That black horse has four legs," both statements are correct, but comparing the truthfulness of these two statements, we can see that the latter is more correct because the latter describes the black horse more specifically. Conversely, the statement "That black horse has five legs" is slightly more correct than the statement "That black horse has no legs but has wings." In a society where many scholars believe that "black horses have wings," even an article saying "black horses have five legs" should be considered the most advanced correct theory of that era, right? Therefore, if someone dislikes my article, then please prove whether the statement "That black horse has four legs" is correct enough. A certain correctness can only be overturned by greater correctness. Those who lack the confidence to overwhelm the other party's correctness with their own correctness can only use assassination to silence the other party. Assassination can suppress the speech of a specific individual, but developing truth often finds supporters among many other people. Ultimately, truth cannot be destroyed by violence. Directly feeling this from a moral perspective, as if a force pursuing justice exists in the universe, the most typical example is Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteous Qi." He says:</p>
<p>"Heaven and earth have righteous Qi, infused and flowing into myriad forms. Below, it becomes rivers and mountains; above, it becomes the sun and stars. In man, it is called vastness, filling the azure sky..."</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the era of rampant assassinations in the Meiji Restoration, Fujita Toko also reflected the desire of the Restoration martyrs to pursue the truth against the violence of the shogunate in this righteous Qi of humanity, and sang: "The heaven and earth are filled with righteous Qi, purely concentrated in the divine land..." After observing this characteristic of truth, Mencius called it "the flood-like Qi." Hegel's self-development of Being (Sein), Marx's "productive forces," and Ranke's moral energy all refer to this relationship between truth and humanity.</p>
<p>Discussing this theory is endless. If we understand that truth cannot be suppressed by power and can only be overturned by a higher level of truth, then our Japanese response to the thinking of the resisting Chinese should also be automatically determined by this principle. First, we Japanese must prove that the truth contained in the Greater East Asia War theory is more advanced and more specific than the truth contained in Chongqing's anti-Japanese nation-building theory and Yan'an's anti-resistance-to-the-end theory. Using outdated truths such as "China and Japan are like brothers" or "same script, same race," we absolutely cannot confront their anti-Japanese theories armed with nationalistic hatred. Whether in Chongqing or Yan'an, their anti-Japanese theories are still based on the objective situation at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1936, which is their weakness because they do not fully understand the changes in the objective situation after the start of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we Japanese and the Nanjing government must target their theoretical weaknesses and develop a genuine war theory of Asian liberation based on the objective conditions after the January 28th Incident (my humble work "Reflections on Japan," published in the January issue of "A Literary Friend," is such an attempt).</p>
<p>Second, it is meaningless to physically eliminate "anti-resistance elements," no matter how many. On the contrary, the more violence we use to suppress them, the stronger they become ideologically. The way to deal with ideological offenders is to transform and persuade them with better ideas. Recently, the new Minister of Administrative Justice, Zhang Yipeng, strongly advocated this point at a banquet. I completely agree with his proposition. I believe that ideological offenders should not be equated with murderers, nor should they be treated as criminals. It is best to regard them as students who need training. As long as they show signs of remorse and self-renewal, they should be unconditionally released immediately, regardless of whether their sentences have been served. If the theory we advocate is truth, and is historically more correct than their theories, even if they return to the anti-resistance camp after being released, they will become the best voluntary propagandists for our theory and will become our living advertisements for the truth.</p>
<p>Third, if our theory is correct, then we have nothing to fear from truth and reality. I hope that we should be allowed to answer any questions raised by anti-resistance advocates frankly and honestly. It is true that we are now in a time of war, and controlling speech is unavoidable, but controlling speech will cause it to wither and decline, becoming useless. Trying to develop war theory is like climbing a tree to catch fish. This World War, it can be said that the final outcome will depend on the war guidance theories of each country. If our war theory does not develop, it will not subdue the other side's war theory. Therefore, as long as speech is within the direction indicated by the government authorities, it should be discussed as openly and frankly as possible, without any fear, within this scope. Without this spirit of discussion, it is truly difficult to develop war guidance theory. Currently, in the anti-resistance areas, "eight-legged essays of resistance" are rampant everywhere, while in the peace areas, "eight-legged essays of peace" are overwhelming. Both of these are actually caused by excessive suppression of speech. The result of excessive suppression of speech is the theoretical basis for those who advocate violence against ideas. Finally, I want to say one thing to the reader who sent the letter. Please rest assured! Because you, with your contradictory mind, know that my article is sugar-coated poison. However, the vast Chinese people, who are smarter than you, will surely know how to use the poison in my articles as medicine.</p>

<h3>Annihilation Battle on the India-Burma Border Progressing Rapidly: Japanese Forces Cut Off Enemy Retreat Route from Maungdaw Area</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from the India-Burma border front, the annihilation battle on the India-Burma border is progressing rapidly. The Japanese forces' encirclement of the enemy's 5th and 7th Divisions has gradually tightened. Senior enemy commanders have reportedly abandoned their subordinates and attempted to escape by plane, resulting in many ugly scenes. According to the overall battle situation as of the evening of the 9th, Japanese forces have steadily completed the encirclement, and the two enemy divisions are on the verge of being annihilated. Enemy forces northwest of Buthidaung, trapped like rats in a bag, have been relying on air supplies of food and ammunition since the afternoon of the 8th. Approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers and 100 vehicles between Oula Bin (about 8 kilometers northwest of Buthidaung) and Sin Zewa have been completely surrounded by Japanese forces. Defeated enemy in this area are suffering the misery of being arrested and annihilated by Japanese forces everywhere. Intense fighting is currently underway in the Mayu Mountains. Meanwhile, a powerful unit of Japanese forces, having broken through the Mayu Mountain range near Donbaik Bazaar, advanced to the Maungdaw-Nakyian Pass road, cutting off the retreat route of the defeated enemy fleeing from the Maungdaw area, and annihilating stubborn enemy forces everywhere. The Nakyian Pass bridge had been destroyed by Japanese forces. Now that Japanese forces have advanced to the road again, the defeated enemy's attempts to escape have become hopeless. The morale of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese forces in fierce battles in various places, is becoming increasingly strong.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in Burma, elite units of the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma bombed the enemy's supply base at Silly Hill in the western Mayu Mountains on the morning of the 10th with a large formation of fighter-bombers, destroying a military bridge built across a tributary of a river near the area, and heavily bombing the enemy's concentrated vehicle groups on both sides of the military bridge, completely cutting off the enemy's retreat route. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. During the bombing, four enemy Spitfire aircraft took off to intercept, but upon seeing the large formation of Japanese aircraft approaching, they fled in disarray without engaging in combat.</p>
<p>Burma, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Army Air Force units in Burma have been attacking the defeated enemy relentlessly day and night. On the morning of the 9th, a large squadron of fighter planes attacked Buthidaung and Maungdaw. Dive bombers discovered about 50 cars and trucks parked at the enemy's key retreat base, and then dive-bombed, causing great chaos. The fighter squadron engaged in a fierce aerial battle with enemy fighter groups, shooting down three Hurricane aircraft and five Spitfire bombers. Two Japanese aircraft exploded in this battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese naval front base in the Indian Ocean, Japanese naval air units bombed and destroyed an enemy 6,000-ton transport ship in the port of Calcutta at dawn on the 11th. All Japanese aircraft returned safely after completing their mission.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Passes National Savings Target for This Year: 36 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Finance Minister Kaya stated at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on January 25 that the national savings target for this fiscal year was expected to be around 35 billion yen. The Japanese Ministry of Finance held a meeting on the 9th of this month and, after considering various circumstances, specifically decided to set it at 36 billion yen, and drafted a proposal to submit to the government.

<h3>Japanese Naval Air Units Active in the South and Central Pacific: Enemy Ships Attacking Nauru Island Repelled</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air units have been extremely active in the South Pacific in recent days. Details are as follows: On the 10th, they attacked the enemy airfield on Mono Island, hitting the runway. One Japanese aircraft did not return in this operation. On the 10th, they heavily bombed enemy land facilities at Torokina, and on the 11th, they bombed the enemy airfield there again. Both times, the Japanese aircraft returned safely. On the morning of the 10th, they destroyed a large enemy transport ship at Buna in New Guinea. The Japanese aircraft returned safely. On the afternoon of the 10th, they destroyed a large enemy transport ship at Finschhafen. On the 11th, they also bombed the port, causing a small enemy transport ship to catch fire after being hit. There were no losses on the Japanese side. Japanese naval air units bombed the enemy airfield at Rabaul on New Britain Island twice on the 11th, causing a major explosion at one location and a fire at another. There were no losses on the Japanese side. Japanese naval air units destroyed two large enemy transport ships and four boats in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea Island on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, although the enemy's invasion of the Marshall Islands is becoming increasingly aggressive, they have been repeatedly repelled by Japanese forces. On the night of the 10th, five enemy Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers and destroyers attacked Taroa Island in the Maloelap Atoll, and shelled Japanese positions. After being heavily attacked by the Japanese garrison on the island, they fled. Damage to the Japanese side was minor. Several enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled Nauru Island on the 10th. After the Japanese garrison engaged them, they retreated. Damage to the Japanese side was minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, the Japanese Army and Navy garrison on Nauru Island in the Marshall Islands intercepted several attacking enemy B-24 type aircraft on the 10th, immediately shooting down one of them. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Former Lieutenant General Tanaka's Speech at the Rural Pacification Conference: The Pacific War Situation and the United States</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing (Continued from yesterday) The following statistical figures are mostly from enemy sources:</p>
<p>Battleships: Number at the start of the war: 1; Number commissioned after the start of the war: 4; Number lost after the start of the war: 4-6; Current number (under repair): 13-12 (5-4)</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers: 7 0 5 1 (1)</p>
<p>Special purpose carriers: 2 1 7 2 (7)</p>
<p>Class A cruisers: 18 0 10 5 (3)</p>
<p>Class B cruisers: 9 8 5 1 1 (1)</p>
<p>Light cruisers: 10 4 4 10</p>
<p>Destroyers: 185 85 31 32 (8)</p>
<p>Submarines: 118 34 37 95 (20)</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the United States suffered great losses in the "Hawaii Naval Battle," the "Coral Sea Naval Battle," and the "Midway Naval Battle." In terms of ship losses alone, there were a full 100, and the loss of aircraft can be counted in the thousands. However, I am concerned about their rapid increase in productivity and efforts to make up for these losses.</p>
<p>They themselves have exaggeratedly announced that US productivity has reached almost its peak last year, increasing several times compared to before the war, etc. However, according to intelligence, the time it takes them to build warships has also been extremely shortened. It used to take them five years to build a battleship, but now they can succeed in three years. Also, aircraft carriers used to take three years, but now it only takes 17 months. Destroyers can be built with one-third the effort as before. Building submarines also only takes one-third the effort as before. By increasing their productivity in this way, we can easily imagine that their large-scale shipbuilding plan, which they had planned before the war, has finally been realized. According to intelligence, the plan focuses on building aircraft carriers, etc. As for naval aircraft, they only had a plan for 15,000 aircraft before the war, but according to the numbers released last summer, it has increased to more than 27,000. Because they seem to have been making efforts to eliminate all difficulties and obstacles in order to implement these plans last year, their naval strength has now reached a level that cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Since last autumn, they have been launching fierce counterattacks from the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands, etc., with their increased strength.</p>
<p>Then, will the United States be able to maintain its current productivity for a long time, replenish its lost forces, and continue its counterattacks? Let us first study the fundamental issues of American resources, industrial capacity, and personnel. However, because there is not enough time, I will only briefly discuss the important parts.</p>
<p>Regarding resources, although the United States is said to be the richest country in the world, things like rubber, tin, tungsten, and high-grade steel had to be purchased from East Asia before the war. Since the start of the war, they have not been able to import these materials, so they are now feeling difficulties. However, if they can cope with these shortages with synthetic rubber, stockpiles, recovered goods, and substitutes, it does not seem to have a major impact. As for industrial capacity, it can be judged that it has roughly reached its peak. According to statistics from last October, their annual production capacity is more than 100,000 aircraft, 60,000 tanks, 53,000 cars, 1.1 million trucks, 20 million tons of transport ships, and 3 million tons of warships. Furthermore, they have made considerable progress in technology. However, when their human resources are insufficient, the supply of highly skilled workers is probably difficult to solve, and this becomes a major problem. In short, the biggest problem in the United States at present is the problem of human resources. President Roosevelt himself said the year before last, "Our biggest difficulty now is the lack of human resources." At the end of last year, the total population of the United States was approximately 134 million, of which approximately 93.5 million were between the ages of 14 and 65, who are considered human resources. So the number of personnel needed last year was roughly:</p>
<p>Military: 10 million people</p>
<p>Other military needs: 20 million people</p>
<p>Civilian needs: 20 million people</p>
<p>Rural needs: 8 million people</p>
<p>Other needs: 5 million people</p>
<p>Total: 63 million people</p>
<p>If we look at it from a numerical point of view, it seems that there is still a surplus of 30 million. In fact, because some people are unhealthy and cannot work, or have other things and cannot leave their families, etc., there are also a considerable number. Therefore, their surplus number of 30 million cannot be entirely a reserve number. This year, it is inevitable that various sectors will need to increase personnel. From this, we can see that their human resources can be said to have reached their limit.</p>
<p>The United States, which was originally a country with extreme female superiority and male inferiority, has now announced a women's registration bill.</p>
<p>And at the end of last year, there were already more than 2 million women engaged in factory labor. From this, we can see that the war potential of the United States has roughly reached its maximum limit.</p>
<p>But how long can they maintain this war potential? When it comes to this, if we look at the human resources of the United States and its huge consumption, it may be this year or next year that they will reach a critical point. Furthermore, if they are to exert their strength on the front lines, these forces prepared in the United States must be transported. When it comes to the problem of transportation, the transportation distance of the United States is more than twice as far as the transportation distance of our country, which is a more unfavorable condition for the United States.</p>
<p>Although the enemy's counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce every day, I have just said that we have now clearly seen the extent of their war potential. Therefore, we not only have full confidence in destroying them, but also have far more abundant human resources than them. Now, if the 1 billion people of East Asia can unite as one, there is no one in the world who can resist us. Furthermore, when it comes to the problem of resources, I have just said that the enemy's productivity has now reached its peak, but our productivity is developing more smoothly day by day.</p>
<p>Since China participated in the Greater East Asia War, it has been fulfilling the important mission of supplying resources until now.</p>
<p>The Rural Pacification work is directly related to the supply of resources. Now, you gentlemen are advancing towards the completion of the Rural Pacification work with extraordinary effort and diligence, and its effect is being seen day by day. I sincerely admire you. It is especially gratifying that, since you are so dedicated to the Rural Pacification work, it not only increases the interests of the Chinese nation and people, but also directly contributes to our war effort, and this is the main key for China to assist in the Greater East Asia War. In view of this, I now hope that the Rural Pacification work will develop and expand more smoothly and brilliantly in the future. At the same time, I sincerely ask you gentlemen to continue to work hard to complete this great work.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for listening to me quietly for so long. My speech is now over (End).</p>
<h3>The Strengthening of Defenses South of Rome; Roosevelt Acknowledges Tense Situation</h3>
<p>Cassino, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the battlefront by Haitong News Agency correspondent Huibai, it has been twenty days since the U.S. Fifth Army began its offensive in the Cassino area. However, Mount Cassino and Mount Cairo, the highest peak of the adjacent Mount Maffei, remain in German hands. If the U.S. military cannot capture Mount Maffei, they will be unable to link up with the Allied forces who landed at Anzio. As for Field Marshal Kesselring, he has achieved his goal of delaying the advance, and the defenses south of Rome have been greatly strengthened in recent weeks. Any further advance by the enemy will come at a heavy price. In the Cassino area, German, Italian, Cossack, and Russian volunteer laborers are busy constructing fortifications. In the past few days, the temperature in the mountains has dropped to -15 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news, superior German forces have launched fierce attacks on the Anzio bridgehead over a 50-kilometer radius. Since the 11th, they have broken through Allied positions in several places, and the Allied forces at the bridgehead are now in danger of being completely annihilated. The Allied forces are awaiting reinforcements from the main force of the U.S. Fifth Army from the Cassino front and are continuing to fight.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to U.S. sources, President Roosevelt stated in an intelligence meeting yesterday that the military situation of the Allied forces at the Anzio bridgehead south of Rome is very tense. He hopes for better weather to aid the Allied naval and land operations on the beachhead.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Lower Dnieper River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: New and fierce battles erupted yesterday near Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih on the lower Dnieper River. Soviet forces launched concentrated attacks and crossed the Dnieper River in an attempt to cut off the German forces, but were unsuccessful. The Soviet bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper is insufficient to disrupt German operations.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports from the rear: In the past 24 hours, Soviet forces have launched fierce attacks in the Vitebsk area, northwest and southeast of the city. Despite their intense efforts throughout the day, they failed to break through. In the northern sector of the Eastern Front, in the Luga area and east of Lake Peipus, Soviet forces also launched fierce attacks. German forces responded with counterattacks, driving the enemy back. The Soviet plan to break through into the forest and swamp area between Luga and Lake Peipus ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Mayor of Hangzhou, Tan Shukuai, Assassinated</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders Arrest of Culprits</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Mayor of Hangzhou, Tan Shukuai, was assassinated by rioters on the 7th of this month. After receiving a telegram from Governor Fu, the Executive Yuan, in addition to ordering generous posthumous honors, also ordered the arrest of the culprits. The original telegram reads as follows: "To Governor Fu of Hangzhou, your telegram of the 8th received. Mayor Tan served with utmost loyalty and diligence. Since taking office in Hangzhou, he has made many contributions. Unexpectedly, treacherous individuals struck, and we have lost a worthy person. The shocking news has deeply saddened us. In addition to instructing the Special Pension Committee to grant generous posthumous honors, this telegram is sent in reply, and we order the arrest of the culprits, ensuring they are brought to justice to console his spirit. Executive Yuan, 12th, stamped."</p>
<h3>Britain Demands Establishment of Air Force Base in Turkey</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A source in Cairo states: The British military headquarters announced on the 11th that British and Turkish authorities have been holding meetings in Cairo for the past five weeks to discuss operational issues. The Times correspondent in Ankara claims that these talks have stalled due to a lack of sincerity on both sides. It is reported that the British government, while maintaining Turkey's neutrality, has strongly demanded the construction of Allied air force bases in Turkey.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency, the British military delegation that arrived in the Middle East five weeks ago has now left Ankara. A Reuters correspondent in Cairo commented that although the discussions between the Allied and Turkish politicians in Cairo have yielded some results, Turkey seems unwilling to allow the Allied powers to establish military bases on Turkish territory.</p>
<h3>Bose Issues Orders to Boost Morale</h3>
<p>Yangon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese troops have launched a concerted offensive in the Arakan region of southern Burma. The Indian National Army (INA) is responding in concert with the Japanese forces, beginning an advance towards their homeland. To boost morale, INA Commander-in-Chief Chandra Bose issued an order to all troops on the 10th, stating that "the day of liberating our homeland is near," urging them to remember the saying "Rather die free than live unfree" and advance towards victory.</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Increases Production of Aircraft Fuel; Secures High-Grade Lubricating Oil</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - To increase the production of aircraft fuel and lubricating oil, the Japanese government previously instructed the Ministry of Munitions to begin research. At a cabinet meeting, an emergency plan to secure aircraft fuel and high-grade lubricating oil was proposed. After Minister of State Kishi explained the reasons for the proposal, it was approved. It was decided that the production of aircraft fuel would be given priority access to personnel, materials, electricity, and machinery, similar to important industries such as copper, iron, coal, light metals, shipbuilding, and aircraft manufacturing.</p>
<h3>The Battle for Europe's Fortress (5)</h3>
<p>Trends on the Iberian Peninsula</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun - If the United States and Britain wish to attack Western Europe and encircle Germany from the west, they will inevitably have to draw the neutral countries of Spain and Portugal on the Iberian Peninsula into the Allied camp. The United States and Britain are using threats and inducements to win them over to the Allied side, and this is the reason why. What is the current situation on the Iberian Peninsula?</p>
<p>Correspondent Ito (Madrid) - Neutral countries are like plankton, acting according to the movements of the war situation. Although the political and economic strategies of the United States and Britain in this area are quite intense, Spain still stands on the side of the Axis powers, while its neighbor Portugal takes a pro-British and pro-American stance. The Iberian efforts of the United States and Britain now proceed from a political standpoint. Some believe that due to the difficulty of the United States and Britain opening a second front in Northern France, they plan to try a landing operation on the Iberian Peninsula. However, this is just a rumor, but if the European landing fails, they might land here for the sake of appearance. The British transport of weapons to Portugal is for this purpose. In the British-Portuguese negotiations, it can already be seen that they are attempting to use this area as a supply base for landing forces and a rear base for receiving the wounded. However, these two countries will absolutely not join the war. At most, they will make slight concessions to appease them.</p>
<p>Correspondent Mogi (Lisbon) - Portugal and its neighbor Spain are extremely sensitive to the development of the European war situation, which is the same as other neutral countries. Even the slightest diplomatic misstep can affect the survival of the country. Therefore, all neutral countries in Europe adopt a wait-and-see attitude. And these two countries always want to maintain their current neutrality if possible. The problem is the malicious activities of the United States and Britain. Since the United States and Britain landed in North Africa, Spain has changed from a "non-belligerent" to "strict neutrality." However, when the Philippines became independent last year, they sent a congratulatory telegram and there were incidents of attacks on British and American consulates, gradually expressing anger towards the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the recall of the Blue Division that participated in the Eastern Front, the recent disbandment of the Falangist army, and Franco's speech praising the leader of the Southern Guerrilla, Chita, also seem to be ingratiating themselves with the United States and Britain. The situation in Portugal is different from that in Spain. First, they have a treaty of alliance with Britain. This treaty, which was generally forgotten, suddenly surfaced last year and became the reason for providing the United States and Britain with an air base in the Azores. No one doubts Prime Minister Salazar's desire to strictly adhere to neutrality, but Salazar's statement that "the British-Portuguese conditions are conditional on Portugal's neutrality" became clearer due to the Azores incident.</p>
<p>Britain can now freely invoke this treaty at any time when it is necessary for itself.</p>
<p>The second point that differs from Spain is the issue of East Timor, which is the focus of attention regarding Japan. However, recently, Salazar has become very understanding of Japan's sincerity regarding this issue.</p>
<p>In short, the neutrality of the Iberian countries, from the subjective standpoint of the rulers of the two countries, has little influence; the position of the two countries depends entirely on the development of the war situation and how the United States and Britain operate.</p>
<p>Italian Front</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun - With the United States and Britain not launching operations in the Balkans today, the Italian front is the only center for Allied forces to attack Germany from the south. What is the current situation on the increasingly intense Italian front?</p>
<p>Correspondent Inai (Rome) - Even the British side does not have satisfactory information about the current war situation. British broadcasts of German reports stating that "the enemy occupied the vital point of Villetto on the Appian Way" are completely unfounded. Regarding the battle situation in the southern mountainous region, Mr. Shimizu of the branch office recently inspected the front line. Please listen to Mr. Shimizu's report.</p>
<p>Correspondent Shimizu (Rome)</p>
<p>I spent eight days on this trip, covering a total distance of about one thousand kilometers. In the east, I went to the Adriatic coast, a few kilometers away from the enemy lines. I also stood on the top of the Apennine Mountains, which are more than two thousand meters above sea level, covered in snow and swept by cold winds, and saw the enemy's movements. I specifically inspected the German front line. The front line currently stretches from Ortona port on the Adriatic Sea to Minturno on the Tyrrhenian Sea, about 160 kilometers. Compared to the front line a month ago, the Central American forces have changed their deployment as follows:</p>
<p>With Pisonno, about two thousand kilometers northwest of Isernia, as the boundary, the British Eighth Army under the command of Lister is to the east, and the U.S. Fifth Army under the command of Clark is to the west, as before. The first line deployment of the British Eighth Army, from the Adriatic Sea, is the Canadian First Division, the Indian Eighth Division. The British Fifth Division, the New Zealand First Division, and finally the British 78th Infantry Division. In addition, there is about one regiment of the Badoglio Army in the rear.</p>
<p>The enemy, which has several times the strength of the German army, is now almost unable to advance. The reason for this is that the German defensive positions are on strategically advantageous high ground, and the German soldiers are fighting bravely, which has frustrated the enemy's advance. The Italian people in the war zone are doing their best to assist the German army, and the Italian soldiers are also fighting valiantly.

<h3>Yesterday, the City Propaganda Office, etc., Held a Grand Tea Party to Entertain Ministers Hirota and Matsudaira</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - To bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the outgoing Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, and to welcome Mr. Matsudaira, the new Information Minister, the Shanghai Special City Propaganda Office, in conjunction with relevant propaganda organizations in the city, held a grand tea party yesterday (the 12th) at the International Hotel on the 14th floor at 3:00 PM. The gathering was lively and grand. Among the attendees were Minister Hirota, Minister Matsudaira, Secretary Manabe, Vice-Consul Fukuma, Director of the City Propaganda Office Liang Xiuyu, Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters Liu Yangshan, Director of the Institute of International Problems Tang Liangli, Director of the News Inspection Office Liu Shike, General Manager of the China Film United Company Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association Zhou Huarin, Chairman of the Film Inspection Committee Zhong Youcai, Acting President of the China Daily News Xu Liqiu, Deputy President Yan Jiabao, and Acting Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency Yang Huilang, totaling over 150 people.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>First, Director Liang delivered the opening speech: "The propaganda, culture, and New Citizen Movement organizations in Shanghai are gathered here today to hold this simple tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the former Information Minister of the Allied Embassy in Shanghai, and to welcome the new Information Minister, Mr. Matsudaira. Although it is simple, it represents the enthusiasm of our colleagues in the spiritual and ideological movement for the two ministers, so it can be said to be a grand event. Minister Hirota has been in office for more than a year, and in that year, he has given us much assistance and guidance. Even as he is about to leave us, he earnestly expects us to work hard to complete the national revolution and achieve China's independence and autonomy. This sentiment is extraordinarily memorable and cherished by us. The new Minister Matsudaira, as we all know, is a person who understands China very well. He has stayed in China for more than ten years, studied at Lingnan University and Peking University, and has been to more places in China than we have. He speaks Chinese better than we do. Since his arrival in China, he has devoted himself to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation in propaganda and culture for a long time. Now that he has come to Shanghai to succeed as Information Minister, I believe he will be able to give us even closer advice and unreserved guidance. We warmly welcome and look forward to it here."</p>
<p>Ministers' Responses</p>
<p>Then, Minister Hirota delivered a speech: "I would like to express my sincere gratitude for holding such a grand tea party for the two of us today. Mr. Liang was too polite to say that the meeting was simple. I came to Shanghai in January the year before last, and almost two years have passed. I am very grateful for the cooperation of all parties during these two years. Since the return of the concessions last August, Sino-Japanese cooperation has become closer. Moreover, I have received the cooperation of many gentlemen in Shanghai to jointly promote the construction of Greater East Asia. When I leave Shanghai this time, I will always remember the kindness of everyone. The new Minister Matsudaira has been introduced by Mr. Liang. He has been in China for a long time, so he will definitely make greater progress in the work of propaganda and reporting between China and Japan in the future." Next, Minister Matsudaira delivered a speech, briefly stating: "Due to time constraints, I will say a few words simply. I have been ordered to come to Shanghai to work this time. In the future, my work will be the same as everyone else's, undertaking propaganda work. I will spend two months, February and March, preparing to exchange views with various authorities and celebrities, and will start a new work plan from April. I hope everyone will pay attention to implementation. In addition, I believe that we should have a sincere and frank attitude in doing things, and there should be no hypocrisy." Finally, Director Zhou delivered a speech. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 6:00 PM, when the party dispersed.</p>

<h3>Famous Japanese Movie Star Visits Director Liang</h3>

<h3>The Beginning of Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>— Xiu Qiao</p>
<p>A Record of Visiting the East Asia Shaping Culture Exhibition</p>
<p>The Japan and Asia Shaping Culture Alliance recently hosted the East Asia Shaping Culture Exhibition, wanting to use shaping culture as a medium to contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia. It has concentrated the shaping power of Japan in order to make the first step in cultural exchange between China and Japan.</p>
<p>The association reveals its purpose: "The culture of a country is actually the manifestation of that country's spirit and life, and among them, shaping culture is the most prominent and concrete expression of the national tradition and creative spirit, as expressed in its architecture or craftsmanship. It is the expression of the nation's unsuppressible shaping power. China has been a country of architecture and craftsmanship since ancient times, rich in excellent shaping power and technical traditions, and its influence has spread to all parts of the world. And Japan, in its shaping culture since its founding, has also extensively absorbed the essence of the world and pioneered its own path, forming a unique Japanese art culture." It also said: "Since ancient times, there have been extensive cultural exchanges between China and Japan in various departments. The history and ethnicity of the two countries have also formed distinct traditions. To this day, at the current stage of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in order to achieve complete understanding and cooperation between China and Japan, the axis of East Asia, and the complete integration of China and Japan, a comprehensive exchange of culture between the two countries is indispensable." From this, we can see the importance of shaping culture in cultural exchange.</p>
<p>The venue of the exhibition is on the fourth floor of the Outer Hsingya Building. The exhibits are all representative works of Japanese art and crafts from afar. Here, one can get a concrete overview of Japanese shaping culture.</p>
<p>Every exhibit, every object, is exquisitely made and skillfully crafted. Among them, Hidezane Katori's "Crafty Lion Knob Incense Burner" is cast in lost-wax form. The prototype is made of tin and covered with river sand, then the solid is melted and molten bronze is poured in. Therefore, its appearance is dignified and has a classical flavor. Hidezane Katori is a member of the Imperial Academy, has many works, and is recognized as a leader in the Japanese craft world. "Tranquil Wind and Bright Moon" is a steel-cast beauty playing the flute, cast in bronze, with ancient Chinese poems engraved on it. The style is ancient and elegant, and it is extremely worthy of appreciation. The author, Nobuo Tsuda, is also a member of the Academy of Arts and is known for his calm and steadfast personality, which can be seen from his works. He is currently regarded as a giant in the Japanese casting world. "Peaceful Auspicious Clouds Inkstone Box" is lacquerware. This technique is called "Takashimaki-e" in Japan, which means gold mud lacquer painting. It involves drawing a sketch with lacquer, applying gold and silver mud powder, repeatedly applying it, and then polishing it. The production is exquisitely detailed and superb, and it was made by Narito Futaki. He is extremely skilled in the makie technique, so he is known as a prodigy in the Japanese lacquer art world. "Peony Hand Box" is also lacquerware, made by mixing lacquer and pigments and using silver pulp, etc. Colorful peonies are painted on the box, which are bright and eye-catching. It is used to store poems and documents, and the author, Hakuyo Takai, is also a famous Japanese lacquer artist. "Dui" is an iron stoneware, with the surface shaved into eight sides and then colored red using chemical methods. The color sample is generous and rich in magic, and it was made by Mitsuhiko Omori, a giant in the Japanese pottery world. His bold style is recognized by the world. "Heavenly Person Flower Vase" is made of black copper forging, with figures, clouds, and patterns engraved on the outside, and the carving technique is extremely smooth. The style is ancient, elegant, and lush, and the author, Kamenosuke Kiyonaga, is skilled in metalworking techniques and is a master in the modern Japanese metalworking world. Other fine products each have their own advantages, too numerous to mention. The lowest price is 3,000 yuan, and the highest is 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Tenth Period of Household Sugar Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow; Announcement of Price Adjustment by the Sugar Merchants' Business Office</h3>
<p>The First District Office issued a notice yesterday stating that from February 14th to 24th of this year, citizens can purchase sugar with the No. 10 Sugar Purchase Coupon. Retail stores, upon receiving each coupon bearing the store's number, should sell five market ounces of white sugar at a price of 8.10 yuan in national currency. Separate charges will be added for electricity packaging, which is optional. Retail donations are exempt. This notice does not apply to the Xihua territory newly incorporated into this district.</p>
<p>Five Regulations for Sale</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has made the following regulations for the tenth period of sugar distribution, hoping that all distribution stores and food households will be informed. 1. Sales are universally made to those in the first district (including the old eighth district) and Nanshi, Xihua, Xuhuafang, Zhabei, the central city area, Longcaozhen, Pudong South, and Pudong North. 2. Each sugar purchase certificate allows Chinese people to purchase five market ounces of refined white sugar or second-grade white sugar, priced at eight yuan and ten cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. Jewish people can purchase ten market ounces of coarse sugar, priced at sixteen yuan and twenty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. Westerners can purchase twenty market ounces of coarse sugar, priced at thirty-two yuan and forty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes, including the cost of the sugar purchase certificate paper. (Retail donations are exempt). Food households must bring their own containers to purchase sugar. Separate charges will be added for packaging if required. 3. The validity period of this sugar purchase certificate is from February 14th to 24th, after which it will be invalid. 4. The sugar allotted to Jewish people is designated to be sold at No. 206 Southeast Fortune, No. 207 Meijiya, and No. 208 Da Lai. 5. All distribution stores should operate in accordance with the regulations. Food households should supervise the weighing when receiving the sugar. If there are incidents of privately raising prices, reducing the quantity, or adding water or impurities, food households can report to this office (No. 23 Yangxing Street, Tongbian Street in the old eighth district) or report to the nearest police agency for investigation.</p>
<p>Adjusting Sugar Prices to Increase Sources</p>
<p>For the tenth period of household sugar, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has consulted with relevant authorities, and the supply has been arranged and the distribution has been scheduled. However, in order to control the increase in prices, the authorities have stipulated that the allotment for Chinese people should be reduced by one ounce compared to the previous period, the allotment for Jewish people should be reduced by two ounces, and the allotment for Westerners should be reduced by four ounces. As for the increase in price, the spokesperson of the office said that there are unavoidable difficulties. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the sugar stored by Chinese merchants has been concentrated for public sale. Since the implementation of the distribution, the price has been strictly limited. Although the prices of various goods have repeatedly risen, the sugar merchants have still maintained low prices, which is out of balance compared to other goods. This is known to all in society. Now, the personal sugar stored by those who are participating in the public sale will soon be sold out. The principal, which is repaid on a regular basis, has been almost completely lost under the current high cost of living, and the purchasing power is therefore weakened. According to the current purchase price, the cost of transporting Zhejiang native sugar to Shanghai is 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per hundred catties, which is more than ten times higher than the selling price of the household sugar in the previous period. If it is not remedied in time, the sugar merchants will inevitably completely lose their purchasing power. Once the supply is interrupted, the people's food will be worrying. In order to maintain purchasing power and increase sources, it was requested to the authorities to readjust the price of sugar. After repeated consideration by the authorities, it was deemed that this was indeed necessary. Therefore, the adjustment was approved this time in order to replenish the sources. The spokesperson also said that the adjusted price is still less than one-third of the purchase price of native sugar, as it still considers the burden of consumers.</p>
<h3>City Rationed Goods: Private Exchange Forbidden</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the ration system for daily necessities in the entire Nanshi (South City) area, the aim has been to alleviate the living burden of the citizens in that area and to curb illegal black market transactions. However, it has been found that a small number of designated stores are privately raising prices or exchanging rationed goods on their own, which is extremely hateful. The Municipal Baojia (Neighborhood Association) Committee, in order to effectively prevent such incidents, has consulted with the Municipal Economic Bureau and ordered the Nanshi Baojia Office and the relevant trade associations to inform all designated stores that they must not violate the regulations and exchange goods privately. If there is deliberate violation, once verified, severe punishment will be imposed to rectify these malicious practices.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>

Present were standing committee members Liu Yangshan, Jian Jianwu, Zhu Ding, etc. Standing Committee Member Yangshan delivered a speech, hoping that all citizens would enthusiastically contribute their efforts to jointly complete the aircraft donation. To ensure the public's trust, the committee plans to publish all donations in newspapers to ensure transparency. Various proposals were then discussed and passed.</p>

<h3>Company Registration Extension: Deadline at the End of April</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Formulates Three Measures</p>
<p>Regarding the re-registration of companies, the Ministry of Industry originally decided to set the deadline at the end of November last year. However, some companies were unable to comply within the time limit and requested an extension. To alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses, the ministry has extended the deadline to the end of April this year. Companies that fail to register after this extended deadline will be strictly dealt with. At the same time, to facilitate the application process for companies in various regions, the ministry has formulated three new measures and ordered the local economic bureaus and relevant agencies to strictly comply with them. The three measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All local economic bureaus or relevant agencies that accept company registration applications must review and forward them to the ministry within seven days, and the ministry will also reply within seven days. (2) If companies applying for registration are unclear about the procedures, they can consult the relevant economic bureau or the commercial department of the ministry for details to avoid delays. (3) If there are cases of false pretenses, swindling, or extortion in the application for registration, it must be reported truthfully, or solved nearby, for strict punishment.</p>

<h3>(I) Kikai - The Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"If you can't find him at the valley, you can find him at Happoen or the Reference Hall." This kind of saying was common in the squad, indicating that he often went to Happoen and the Reference Hall. The Education Reference Hall, formerly located in the student hall, was rebuilt before and after the students entered school. It was a magnificent neoclassical stone building like the Naval Hall in Tokyo. It is said that even the "Dartmouth Naval School" in England and the "Annapolis Naval Academy" in the United States do not have such facilities.</p>
<p>When cadets saw the instructors, they would salute before passing in front of the Education Hall. Inside the hall were clothes of war dead stained with blood, marble nameplates engraved with the names of graduates who died in battle, the last writings of Lieutenant Commander Hirose and Submarine Captain Sakuma, historical materials of past navies and military strategies—as well as other materials recording the honor and tradition of the Japanese Navy, filling the entire hall. But Makoto finally understood the direction the instructors were looking when they saluted.</p>
<p>That was the Togo Marshal Room, accessible via the central staircase from the main entrance. In the center was a lock of the Marshal's hair, and next to it was a full-body portrait embedded in the wall. The old veteran of the home army, who had transported soil for his grave, looked down at Makoto with a solemn and benevolent face.</p>
<p>Upon entering this room, Makoto felt as if he was possessed by some kind of inspiration and hesitated to leave. It was as if everything Makoto was seeking was combined here, cast into a jewel, and placed there.</p>
<p>"The Marshal embodied the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy throughout his life, revealing it without reservation. Our naval spirit is reflected in the Marshal's words and deeds. There are countless brave admirals and wise generals in the Japanese Navy, but only the Marshal has embodied the ideals and model of a naval officer since ancient times. The Marshal is a symbol of the Japanese naval spirit. An absolute standard for all naval personnel. We must never forget to learn from the Marshal, no matter when or where..."</p>
<p>Makoto carefully looked at the beautiful photographs of the Marshal in his youth displayed in the showcases, countless medals, and neatly arranged English physics notes from his time studying in England. His admiration for the Marshal became even more intense. During his time off on Sundays, he would sit in the library of the hall, engrossed in reading a detailed biography of Togo Marshal.</p>
<p>Makoto learned not only about the Kōshō incident and the J-shaped battle formation of the Battle of Tsushima, but also the Marshal's decisiveness. He heard about his composure when the Hatsushima and Yashima battleships sank, his meticulousness in never getting close to a horse's hind legs, and his prudence in conducting training even on the day after the Battle of Tsushima. Moreover, his silence, generosity, and simplicity—everything—were the conditions of the famous general that Makoto ideally wanted to achieve. Makoto had never had a concrete understanding of how great a man the Marshal was.</p>
<p>"I also hope to live like the Marshal, but..."</p>
<p>Naval students in the era without treaties did not plan to live as long as the Marshal.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Of course, nothing can be rushed. Superficial understanding is absolutely forbidden.</p>
<p>Although that's what they said, Makoto thought it was too formal to have a military band sent from Kure City to teach the students the school song, "The Song of Etajima."</p>
<p>During the military song time after dinner, the early summer sunset glow, the fine grass on the parade ground, and the white uniforms of the military band were all clearly visible.</p>
<p>After repeatedly playing the music several times, the teacher demonstrated the correct way to sing—regarding both the music and the strength, it was considered the correct standard. It was not like singing with brute force as in high school.</p>
<p>The turbulent ocean waves</p>
<p>Where towering waves surge</p>
<p>The first verse had already begun, but when it came to singing, which he had been bad at since elementary school, Makoto found it most difficult to make his voice heard as much as possible. Now, he was not allowed to sing casually. So he loudly produced that out-of-tune sound, without shame or regard for appearances.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Method for Saving Fuel for Cooking</h3>
<p>To save fuel and time for cooking three meals a day, a method is introduced as follows: Overlap and weave old clothes, old quilts, etc., into a thick nest, like a bird's nest shape, with the surrounding area as thick as possible. If there is an empty leather suitcase or wooden box, etc., it can also be used. Place the made nest in the box, it is best to leave no gaps around, and use similar old cotton fabrics to make a lid that matches the size of the nest. As for the capacity of the nest, the depth and size should match the size of the rice pot to be used.</p>
<p>For example, if you cook rice at seven or eight in the morning every day, use the remaining fire from cooking or add a little fuel, and immediately store the pre-rinsed rice and water in another prepared pot and put it on the stove to cook. When cooking, you don't have to wait until it is completely cooked. As soon as the water is boiling and the rice grains are elongated, lift the lid of the pot and immediately put it into the prepared warm nest. Then cover the cotton cloth lid tightly on top and around all four sides, and place it in a well-ventilated place or small room, which can also be used for heating. Until lunch, when you take it out to eat, the rice vapor is steaming, and the heat is no less than that of freshly cooked rice on the stove, and the aroma is particularly fragrant, the grains are soft and moist, which is more than good enough. It saves money and effort, killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>This is in terms of the cold winter climate. If the climate is slightly warmer or in summer, if you follow this method, the heat in the pot can be retained for at least twelve hours. If so, you can cook rice only once in the morning every day, and you don't need to light a fire for lunch and dinner. If you want to preserve the heat of side dishes and soups, you can also imitate this method and make a few more warm nests for use. As for the old cotton fabrics at home, if there are not enough to prepare, you can take one or two old short shirts, and when the rice is about to be cooked, immediately take the rice pot up, wrap it well, and put it in the quilt on the bed, sealing the surroundings tightly. This is also fine. This is my personal experience, and I hope everyone will try it. (Yan Wu)</p>

<p>Lost Children of Peddlers: When I was at the office, a man named Chen Shigao, a peddler, lost two children on the sixteenth of last month. One is Abao, eight years old, and the other is Miao, twelve years old, living at No. 446 Fangbang Bridge. He asked where to report the lost children. He looked very pitiful. In addition to telling him to report to the Children's Welfare Section of the Health Department, I also hope that anyone who knows their whereabouts will find a way to reunite them with their family.

<h3>At the Reception for the Press: Speech by a Representative of the Medical Community</h3>
<p>Speech by Yu Yunxiu (Continued)</p>
<p>Just now, Mr. Gu Nanqun cited an example of a dying child who still died after the doctor gave him a heart stimulant. The family, without careful consideration, blamed the doctor for the error in diagnosis. I think there are pre-existing questions in this matter. First, if the doctor suddenly accepts a dying patient, is there time to examine the patient without first using a heart stimulant to sustain them? Second, can heart stimulants kill people? Third, can pulmonary diphtheria be diagnosed immediately? Fourth, is the inconsistency between the clinical diagnosis and the autopsy a particularly negligent mistake on the part of the doctor? If the doctor can be convicted on this basis, then the most famous medical experts in the world's top universities would be in jail every day. If this trend is not corrected, I am afraid that many unfortunate things will happen in the future.</p>
<p>First, doctors, fearing future troubles, will not dare to perform emergency surgery on patients in critical condition. The patient's life will be in great danger. Second, people who study medicine will become discouraged. They have become doctors, but there is no way out. Who would want to teach their children to study medicine again? China, which is not very developed in medicine, will become even more backward and unfortunate in the future. Third, most of our society still has an attitude of underestimating science. If medicine, the vanguard of a country's culture, is defeated first, the heart of underestimating medicine will become even more serious, and science will never develop. Letting it fall behind and regress every day is not only related to the dignity of the country, but the future danger is unimaginable.</p>
<p>The members of the press who have come here today are all intellectuals in our country. Please uphold justice, lead society, and move towards the path of righteousness. This is what I hope for.</p>
<p>Speech by Yan Fuqing</p>
<p>Today, the representatives of the three organizations representing the medical community in this city and the country are hosting members of the press because disputes between doctors and patients have occurred from time to time recently. The results of this are detrimental to both the medical community and patients. In order to resolve such unfavorable events, my colleagues in the medical community have an organization of review committees that make fair judgments based on the position of medicine. The results of the review are submitted to the court for adoption to serve as the basis for judgment, and provided to the public for reference to state public opinion.</p>
<p>At present, the impression that some medical practitioners give to society is also very bad: they lack a spirit of service, are only interested in money, and poor patients have little hope of being treated. It is undeniable that such doctors lack moral concepts. Recently, colleagues in the medical community have been planning to set up a health experiment area, the purpose of which is to allow general practitioners to have the opportunity to serve the common people in their spare time. As for unscrupulous elements who take advantage of professional opportunities to defraud money, we should request the authorities to strictly ban and punish them.</p>
<p>Medicine can be divided into two parts: medical science and medical practice. New medicine is scientific medicine, which does not distinguish between countries, and makes all accurate and effective inventions public to the world, but its progress is still limited. There are only a few diseases that have definitive treatments, and there are many diseases that have accurate diagnostic methods and effective prevention methods, but no definite treatment methods. Even misdiagnosis is not uncommon. According to the comparison results of clinical diagnoses and autopsy diagnoses over the years in Harvard University Medical School, the highest medical institution in the United States, the two are consistent in only 30%. The difficulty of diagnosis can be imagined.</p>
<p>The development of medical practice shifts with the needs of society. The public thinks that medicine can be bought with money, and thus more commercialized doctors ignore the diagnosis and prescribe medicine in a hasty manner. Can medical affairs still be questioned? Moreover, because they are intent on business, new doctors use serum to treat diphtheria and 606 to treat syphilis, and the effects are indeed remarkable, but in recent times, old doctors have also used them. However, because they do not understand medical principles, their application is often wrong, and they harm patients. I sincerely hope that the press and the medical community will work together to popularize common medical knowledge, which will not only be a blessing for the medical community, but also for society.</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association, the Doctors' Association, and the Hospital Federation held a reception for the press in this city on the 20th of last month. During the reception, doctors' representatives Gu Nanqun, Yan Fuqing, and Yu Yunxiu gave speeches, which were of great value. As they were not recorded in detail at the time, the full text is now republished above. - Editor's Note</p>
