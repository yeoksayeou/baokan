<h3 id="c1">互助精神 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>新聞事業是我們的本業，可是，我們近來發起，參加和協助不少的社會事業，却都不是新聞事業，也許有人認爲我們喜歡多事，或者好管閒事。其實我們最不想多事，我們更不好管閒事。我們對於社會事業的所以表示熱心，根本目的，要想竭盡我們的棉力，提倡國民互助的精神，以期造成社會上的互助風氣。</p>
<p>已故黃廣自先生生前常談日本人民的互助精神，他在民國二十三年四月十八日新中國建設協會演講中說：「我在日本，看到日本人遇到苦力推車上坡，無論何人，必見而助之，獨我國人，不但無此種互助精神，反商袖　　觀，以爲笑樂。我國索來只知「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」，現在甚至不但他人瓦上霜置之不理，連自己的門前雪也不掃了」。他認爲這是中國國民的劣根性。不能互助的國民，怎樣能够合作，不能合作的國民，怎樣能够建國。</p>
<p>幫助苦力推車上城是多事，是管閒寺，可是，道就是日本國民眞實的互助精神的表現。反觀我國，就以上海而論，馬路上看熱鬧是一般人普遍的心理，每逢相罵吵架，行入圍看，惟恐不及。日本入幫助苦力推事，中國人圍看吵架，兩個國家的民族性的表現，孰是孰非，殊值我們的深切反省。</p>
<p>建設一個現代化的國家，其艱苦因難，好比推車上坡。這個車子，旣重且大，這個山坡，又高又遠，車夫的責任眞是一任重道遠」。中國現在的環境，好比車子走到半坡，上不了坡，就只有落在坡下。在此時間，非得集合許多人的力量，共同合作，衆擊推拉，方才能够達到山頂，否則便是全功盡棄。古人所謂，「任重道遠，仁以爲己任」，「國家與亡，匹夫有責」，主意就在說明這個道理。現在不是平常的時候，「袖手旁觀」在平時已經要不得，此時此地更是使不得。大多數人的袖手旁觀，可以使中國自趨滅亡，太多數人的通力互助，可以促成中國的早日復興。孰棄孰從，更值得我們的深切反省。</p>
<p>我們主張互助，唯一的希望就在大家於努力本身事業之外，要竭力幫助社會上一切有利的工作。事無論大小，只求有利國家民族，我們大家就應當協力以助，促共成功。社會事業，決非憑一人之力所能成功，建國大業，更須羣策羣力。社會國家和國民本身，都有連帶性的，一件小事的效果，可以影響及於整個國家社會，受這件事的福利的，更不是少數人，而是全國國民。所以全國國民都有互幼精神，造成互助風氣，也就是全國國民自己替自己創迭福利，而基於互助精神而造成的福利，方才是眞實的永久的福利</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本學術界的偉績　文化動章受動者介紹 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>四月二十九日天長節，日本舉行文化動章授勳禮。是日上午十時，在賞勳局總裁室由瀨古總裁對下列六氏（狩野，高楠兩氏因病缺席）授與勳章並動記。</p>
<p>自昭和十二年二月十一日制定文化勳章以來，此爲第四次。但全體受勳均從學術界中選出則此尚爲初次。於此可見日本學術界在決戰時期下孜孜研究的成績。榮受勳章的六氏，均在各專門分野上多年努力研究，著有成續，對日本文化之創造的發展，具有卓絕的功續。</p>
<p>受勳的六氏爲物理學界元老，航空界之先進指導者田中館傳士，超短波研究家的岡部博士，赤痢菌發現者的志賀博士，內科學權威稻田博士，漢學家的狩野博士，刋行大正新修大藏經，在發揚與普及佛敎文化上建立不朽業績的高楠博士，茲介紹其略歷如後：</p>
<p>高楠順次郎博士</p>
<p>高楠博士，以研究印度哲學，梵語學者著稱世界。今年七十九歲，生於展島縣，爲月給三圓之授業生，與故花幷卓藏博士同事爲小學敎員二人因喜談政治而同被免職。高楠博士走京都，爲西本願寺之擊柝者，苦學力行，其努力爲高楠家所悉，收爲養子，留學英國牛津大學並德法等國，在牛津攻讀時，將中文「觀無豐壽經」及「南海寄歸傳」認為英文，明確考設書中最難解之地名，此爲最初在世界的印度哲學界上留下了不朽的英名。</p>
<p>博士畢生的大事業，自大正十一年以來，費十年歲月，刋行大正新修大藏經一萬二千卷。此爲正倉院勅對之古代寫經，自中亞發見之古寫本以次，築世界各國秘藏文獻之大成，而加以嚴密考證，較光前刋行之漢譯大藏紹，更顯示前所未有之研究成果，堪稱爲佛敎學上空前絕後之舉。</p>
<p>狩野直喜博士</p>
<p>狩野，爲世界有數之漢學者，中文文藻，即中國人亦爲之敬服。今年七十七歲。昔年留學中國時，值義和團之變，親自執槍而起，傳爲佳話。博士在京大研究中國派學，中國文學，哲學，哲學史，歷二十餘年，其學問淵博，識見不局流俗，凌越學術精到之淸代考證學者，經術，詩文，書法，無不精通，善操漢語英語。博士對漢學之研究態度，根據近代科學的研究法，以一日本人而能完全消化之，不拘於一家之言，排除模倣，不嘗糟粕，不失日本人之立塲，且在學術詞章上，亦多凌駕中國人之上者。</p>
<p>田中館愛覺博士</p>
<p>田中館愛橘博士，安政三年生，今年九十多歲，但精神充沛，不減壯年，在公私各種集會時，時可見其蹤跡。博士之業績，其大老有四：即日本物理學之建設，米突法之統一，日本航空界之育成，及用羅馬字普及日本語。博士所着眼者，常着人先鞭，而爲他人所不注意者。</p>
<p>日本物理學之大學敎育，於明治十二年始由故山川健次郎男嚴開始日本人自行敎授。博士於大學畢業後，即爲准助敎，十六年爲助授，廿四年，留學國外歸來，任爲敎授，至此，日本之物理學敎育始完全脫離外人而獨立。至大正六年辭官時止，此廿七年間，奠定日本物理學之基礎，科學乃有今日之盛，其功蓋不可沒。</p>
<p>日本參加米突制條約，在明治十八年。博士爲萬國度量衡會議常務委員，屢出席國際會議。關於光學及電磁氣單位亦盡力頗多。博士在四十年前即己從國防上的見地認識飛機之重要性，在貴族院的屢次質問中，及在講演中，東京帝大之諸研究設施上，以及一切航空團體，航空有關事項上，盡瘁啓迪國民，直接問接所貢獻於日本航空界者，殆不可以數計云。</p>
<p>岡部金治郎博士</p>
<p>以分割陽極及「大阪管」之發明而著稱世界電氣學界之岡部金治郎博士，今年五十一歲。博士之研究中以關於磁電管者特別著各，日本之超短波研究，因此而走上實際的軌道·初由磁電發生微弱的超短波面獲得成功之博士，繼續研究改良，卒由分割陽極磁電電管使發生相當强的極超短波。昭和二年在帝國學士院發表後，在世界學術界給與極大刺激，使各國磁餛管之製作，有飛躍進步。繼再施行，而消除無綫餛收報上諸難點，更在昭和十一年發明新型發振管「大阪管」，而得以理想的賞行强力極超短波之發生與變調。</p>
<p>更發明「電子發光磁電管」，提高發振器的能率，而使學術界爲之驚嘆。昭和十六年，帝國學士院對博士之發見由磁餛管發生極超短波，及大阪管與發光磁電管之發明等，會授與恩賜賞。</p>
<p>稻田龍吉博士</p>
<p>稻田博士之名，以脚氣與疽出血病之研究而著。迄今年七十一歲止，發表論文達數百篇。大正四年，與井戶泰博士協刀發見疸出血症的病原諒並又修正了發炎性黃嚴重症就疸出血的錯誤，大正五年，帝國學士院授與恩賜賞。七年，轉任東大敎授，昭和九年，因年高退職。爲內科學之權威，研究發表之主要者有疸病，關於脚氣之研究，日本流行性腦膜炎之研究，赤痢保菌者之調查研究等，現為學術研究會會員，日本醫療團總裁，日本醫師會會長。</p>
<p>志賀潔博士</p>
<p>明治二十九年帝國大學醫科大學卒業，畢業後即入傳染病研究所爲北星博士之助手。明治三十年，檢查許多赤痢患者之糞便，就其培養後發生之細菌集落，試騐其對患者血淸之凝集反應，發見各種細菌集中反應最　之特殊策落，苒進一步研究這細菌，卒確認其爲赤痢之病原。三十一年，在學會中報告其成績，此即所調志賣赤痢菌。繼又製造赤痢治療血淸，並施行預防注射，今年七十五歲。（翔：譯自四月三十日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c3">日大本營昨發表　陸海軍綜合戰果　四月份墜毀敵機七一六架 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午三時發表：日陸·海軍部隊四月份對敵航空隊進攻及邀擊作戰所獲之綜合戰果如次：　敵方所受損害，南太平洋方面擊落敵機二三二架（內不確實者十二架），擊毀一○一架。中太平洋方面擊落敵機一四七架（內不確實者六架），擊毀五十四架。緬甸方面繫落敵機七十四架（內不確實者二十五架），擊毀及焚毀六十六架。中國方面繫落敵機二十架，擊毀及焚毀二十架。北太平洋方面擊落敵機一架，擊毀一機。以上合計七一六架（內不確實者四十三架）。　日方損害，自炸未歸還者九十架。　損害八十五架，合計一七五架。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　東亞戰城之空軍決戰，逐日激烈，敵機於四月間，來襲日軍各戰綫，總計其機數達二萬四千九十七架之多，創開戰以來之記錄，日陸海軍空航隊，於緊密之協同下，北迄北千島，南達新幾內亞，東方自馬紹爾羣島，西至印度，於此龐大戰域，協力地上部隊作戰，護衛船團，進攻敵基地，更迎擊來襲之敵機，以寡兵書夜繼續奮戰力鬥，四月間，擊落敵機四百七十架，擊毀敵機二百四十二架，總計殲減敵機七百十六架。戰果赫赫，日方自炸未返者九十架，地下損害共八十五架，合計喪失百七十五架，茲誌各戰綫之戰鬥概要如次：</p>
<p>南太平洋</p>
<p>新幾內亞戰綫之空戰最爲激烈，三月問來襲敵機數爲三千七百二十五架，四月份激增至五千三百二架，敵爲策應四月二十二日在荷蘭地亞，阿伊答伯之新登陸作戰，陸海空一體圖突破該方面日軍戰略錢，該戰綫之應鬥此後將趨惡化。敵機來襲班達拉方面，三月間爲百六十五架，四月間激增至九百七十架，顯示敵軍在該方面之蠢動企圖。敵機於三月間來襲波根維爾島，機數爲六千五十架，四月間減少至三千二百五十四架，敵方鑒於日軍三月間在特羅基納附近展開大攻勢，故集中南太平洋方面空軍主力在該戰綫，其後入交戰狀態。敵機長攻俾斯麥羣島，依然次數頻繁，日軍則畫夜迎擊來襲之敵機，在拉巴爾戰錢之戰果，計擊落敵機二百三十二架，擊毀敵機百一架。</p>
<p>中太平洋</p>
<p>敵機於四月間來襲中部太平洋日領各羣島，其機數達三千六十二架，足證敵侵攻戰意之雄，該方面之戰果，計擊落敵機百四十七架，擊毀敵機十四架。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>隨日軍進攻印度之進展，敵方即舉其空軍現有總力，迭次來襲，四月份來襲之機數，達七千三百六十四架，較之三月增加一倍，日軍陸軍機隊擊落及擊毀其一百四十架（其中未經證實者二十五架），內以Dc3之大型運輸機佔多數，計三十四架，當此敵軍對伊姆法爾包圍　內之敵軍及降落於北緬之空軍挺身部隊積極進行補給之時，日空軍擊落其運輸機如此之多，此實予敵以重大打擊。</p>
<p>中國方面</p>
<p>四月份敵機來架架數計二百九十六架，較之三月份來襲之機數爲少。按三月份來襲機數計三百八十三架，其原因出於日軍發動對印度進攻作戰，使其一部不得不調往印度戰錢，但由此次河南作戰，敵機之活動，或將再度積極，日空軍在該方面之戰鬥，計繫落擊破其二十架。</p>
<p>北太平洋</p>
<p>由於阿留申方面敵基地之完成及天氣轉住，四月份來襲之敵機數較之三月份倍形增加，反映該方面漸次緊迫之情勢</p>
<p>泰越方面</p>
<p>敵軍對該方面之空襲，仍不出呼游擊之範圍，來襲機數，較上月無大增減。綜觀敵機來襲狀况，三月份來襲之敵機，計一萬八千三百二十九架。四月份爲二萬四千九十七架，較三月份增加五千七百六十八架。以上所述空戰，今巳成爲戰局之中心，而敵空軍對南太平洋及緬甸方面之空襲，亦將更爲熾烈。</p>

<p>柏林九日中央社電　德國通信社訊：自八日起，本週之之戰局有兩種事實最值吾人注目，第一，即蘇軍在普魯特河與摩爾達維亞間及轟斯特河下游，展開大規模攻勢遭遇失敗後，刻已不見何等動靜。第二，即入本週後反軸心空軍空襲歐陸，已不得不利用密雲掩護。德軍當局又謂東綫所以能保持平靜狀能態者，乃係蘇軍損失過大所致，此固得歸攻於羅洪軍隊之協力，但同時德軍之新攻擊戰術，亦實有莫大功績。德軍特製裝有對戰車砲之俯轟機，其對戰車隊攻擊效力之偉次，實足驚人，該戰法自今春已被德軍開始採用，於未來之大規模作戰中，預想定可獲得莫大戰果。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Spirit of Mutual Assistance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The newspaper business is our profession, but recently, we have initiated, participated in, and assisted in many social causes that are not related to the newspaper business. Perhaps some people think that we like to meddle or be nosy. In fact, we least want to meddle, and we certainly don't like being nosy. Our enthusiasm for social causes stems from our fundamental desire to do our utmost to promote the spirit of mutual assistance among the people, in order to create a social atmosphere of mutual help.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Huang Guangzi often talked about the spirit of mutual assistance among the Japanese people during his lifetime. In a speech to the New China Construction Association on April 18, 1934, he said: "In Japan, I saw that whenever a coolie was pushing a cart uphill, anyone would help him. Only our people do not have this spirit of mutual assistance, but instead stand by and watch, taking it as a joke. Our country has always only known 'each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on another's roof.' Now, we even ignore the frost on others' roofs, and don't even sweep the snow from our own doorsteps." He believed that this was a bad habit of the Chinese people. How can a nation that cannot help each other cooperate? How can a nation that cannot cooperate build a country?</p>
<p>Helping a coolie push a cart uphill is meddling, is being nosy, but it is a true expression of the spirit of mutual assistance of the Japanese people. Looking back at our country, taking Shanghai as an example, watching the excitement on the streets is a common mentality of most people. Whenever there is a quarrel, they rush to watch, fearing they will miss out. Japanese people help coolies push carts, Chinese people watch quarrels. Which is right and which is wrong in the expression of the national character of the two countries is worthy of our deep reflection.</p>
<p>Building a modern country is as arduous and difficult as pushing a cart uphill. The cart is heavy and large, and the hill is high and far. The carter's responsibility is truly a "heavy burden and a long road." China's current situation is like the cart reaching the middle of the slope. If it cannot go up, it will only fall down the slope. At this time, it is necessary to gather the strength of many people, work together, and push and pull in unison to reach the top of the mountain. Otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. As the ancients said, "A heavy burden and a long road; benevolence is one's own responsibility," and "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." The main idea is to explain this principle. Now is not a normal time. "Standing idly by" was already unacceptable in normal times, and it is even more unacceptable here and now. The inaction of the majority can lead China to self-destruction, while the united mutual assistance of the majority can promote China's early revival. Which to abandon and which to follow is worthy of our deep reflection.</p>
<p>We advocate mutual assistance with the sole hope that everyone, in addition to working hard in their own careers, will do their utmost to help all beneficial work in society. Regardless of the size of the matter, as long as it benefits the country and the nation, we should all cooperate to help and promote its success. Social undertakings can never be successful by the efforts of one person alone. The great cause of building the country requires the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. Society, the country, and the people themselves are all interconnected. The effect of a small matter can affect the entire country and society, and the benefits of this matter are not limited to a few people, but to the entire nation. Therefore, it is important for the entire nation to have a spirit of mutual assistance and create an atmosphere of mutual help. This is how the entire nation creates benefits for itself. The benefits created based on the spirit of mutual assistance are the most real and lasting.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Great Achievements of the Japanese Academic Community: Introduction to Recipients of the Order of Culture <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>On April 29th, Tencho-setsu (the Emperor's Birthday), Japan held a ceremony for awarding the Order of Culture. At 10:00 a.m. that morning, the President of the Decoration Bureau, Mr. Seko, presented the decorations and certificates to the following six individuals (Mr. Kano and Mr. Takakusu were absent due to illness) in the President's office.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time the Order of Culture has been awarded since it was established on February 11, 1937. However, this is the first time that all recipients have been selected from the academic community. This shows the diligent research achievements of the Japanese academic community during this time of decisive battle. The six recipients of the Order have been working hard in their respective fields of expertise for many years, have written achievements, and have made outstanding contributions to the creation and development of Japanese culture.</p>
<p>The six recipients of the Order are: Mr. Tanakadate Aikitsu, an elder in the field of physics and a pioneer in the field of aviation; Dr. Okabe, a researcher of ultra-short waves; Dr. Shiga, the discoverer of the dysentery bacillus; Dr. Inada, an authority on internal medicine; Dr. Kano, a scholar of Chinese studies; and Dr. Takakusu, who published the Taisho Revised Tripitaka and established immortal achievements in promoting and popularizing Buddhist culture. Here is an introduction to their brief histories:</p>
<p>Dr. Takakusu Junjiro</p>
<p>Dr. Takakusu is world-renowned as a scholar of Indian philosophy and Sanskrit. He is 79 years old this year and was born in Chiba Prefecture. He was a student who received three yen a month. He and the late Dr. Hanaoka Takuzo were colleagues as elementary school teachers. The two were dismissed because they liked to talk about politics. Dr. Takakusu went to Kyoto and became a "clapper" at the Nishi Honganji Temple. He worked hard and diligently. His efforts were recognized by the Takakusu family, who adopted him and sent him to study at Oxford University in England and in Germany and France. While studying at Oxford, he translated the Chinese "Sutra of Immeasurable Life" and "A Record of the Buddhist Religion As Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago" into English, and clearly identified the most difficult place names in the book. This was the first time he left an immortal name in the world of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p>Dr. Takakusu's lifelong great work, from 1922, took ten years to publish the Taisho Revised Tripitaka, 12,000 volumes. This is an ancient scripture written by the Imperial Court of Shosoin, from the ancient manuscripts discovered in Central Asia, to the great collection of secret documents from various countries in the world, and with rigorous textual research, compared with the previously published Chinese translation of the Tripitaka, it shows unprecedented research results, and can be called an unprecedented event in Buddhist studies.</p>
<p>Dr. Kano Naoki</p>
<p>Kano is one of the world's leading scholars of Chinese studies. His Chinese literary talent is admired even by Chinese people. He is 77 years old this year. When he studied in China in his early years, he encountered the Boxer Rebellion and personally took up a gun to fight. This is a well-known story. Dr. Kano studied Chinese literature, philosophy, and history of philosophy at Kyoto University for more than 20 years. His knowledge is broad, and his insights are not limited to common customs. He surpassed the Qing Dynasty textual scholars in the precision of his scholarship. He is proficient in scriptures, poetry, calligraphy, and is skilled in both Chinese and English. Dr. Kano's attitude towards the study of Chinese studies is based on modern scientific research methods. As a Japanese, he can completely digest it, not adhering to one family's words, eliminating imitation, not tasting dregs, not losing the Japanese position, and surpassing the Chinese in academic vocabulary.</p>
<p>Dr. Tanakadate Aikitsu</p>
<p>Dr. Tanakadate Aikitsu was born in 1856 and is over 90 years old this year, but he is full of energy and no less than in his prime. He can be seen at various public and private gatherings. Dr. Tanakadate has four major achievements: the construction of Japanese physics, the unification of the metric system, the development of the Japanese aviation community, and the popularization of the Japanese language using Roman letters. What Dr. Tanakadate focused on was always ahead of others and not noticed by others.</p>
<p>Japanese physics education at the university level began in 1879 with the late Mr. Yamakawa Kenjiro, who was the first Japanese to teach it. After graduating from university, Dr. Tanakadate became an assistant teacher, and in 1883, he became an assistant professor. In 1891, he returned from studying abroad and was appointed as a professor. At this point, Japanese physics education was completely independent of foreigners. Until he resigned in 1917, he laid the foundation for Japanese physics in these 27 years, and his contribution to the prosperity of science today cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Japan joined the Metric Convention in 1885. Dr. Tanakadate was a standing member of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and repeatedly attended international conferences. He also made great efforts regarding optical and electromagnetic units. Dr. Tanakadate recognized the importance of aircraft from a national defense perspective 40 years ago. In repeated questions in the House of Peers, in lectures, at the research facilities of Tokyo Imperial University, and in all aviation organizations and aviation-related matters, he exhausted himself in enlightening the people. His direct and indirect contributions to the Japanese aviation community cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Dr. Okabe Kinjiro</p>
<p>Dr. Okabe Kinjiro, known in the world of electrical engineering for his invention of the split anode and the "Osaka Tube," is 51 years old this year. Among Dr. Okabe's research, his work on magnetrons is particularly prominent. Japan's research on ultra-short waves has thus embarked on a practical track. Initially, Dr. Okabe succeeded in generating weak ultra-short waves from a magnetron. He continued to research and improve, and finally used a split-anode magnetron to generate a fairly strong extremely high-frequency wave. After it was announced at the Imperial Academy in 1927, it gave a great stimulus to the world's academic community, and made the production of magnetrons in various countries leap forward. Continuing to implement it, it eliminated the difficulties in wireless receiving and reporting, and in 1936, he invented a new type of oscillation tube, the "Osaka Tube," which made it possible to generate and modulate ideal, strong, extremely high-frequency waves.</p>
<p>He also invented the "electron-emitting magnetron," which increased the efficiency of the oscillator and amazed the academic community. In 1941, the Imperial Academy awarded Dr. Okabe an Imperial Prize for his discovery of the generation of extremely high-frequency waves by magnetrons and the invention of the Osaka Tube and the luminescent magnetron.</p>
<p>Dr. Inada Ryukichi</p>
<p>Dr. Inada's name is known for his research on beriberi and leptospirosis. To date, at the age of 71, he has published hundreds of papers. In 1915, in cooperation with Dr. Ido Yasu, he discovered the causative agent of Weil's disease, and also corrected the error of inflammatory yellow severe jaundice. In 1916, the Imperial Academy awarded him an Imperial Prize. In 1918, he transferred to Tokyo University as a professor, and in 1934, he retired due to old age. He is an authority on internal medicine. His main research publications include jaundice, research on beriberi, research on Japanese epidemic meningitis, and surveys and research on dysentery carriers. He is currently a member of the Academic Research Council, President of the Japan Medical Team, and President of the Japan Medical Association.</p>
<p>Dr. Shiga Kiyoshi</p>
<p>Graduated from the Imperial University Medical College in 1896. After graduating, he joined the Institute of Infectious Diseases as an assistant to Dr. Kitazato. In 1897, he examined the feces of many dysentery patients, and in the bacterial colonies that grew after their cultivation, he tested their agglutination reaction to the patients' serum. He discovered special strategies that concentrated various bacterial concentration reactions. He further studied this bacteria and finally confirmed that it was the causative agent of dysentery. In 1898, he reported his results at the academic conference, which is the so-called Shiga dysentery bacillus. He then manufactured dysentery treatment serum and carried out preventive vaccinations. He is 75 years old this year. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 30)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Integrated War Results of the Army and Navy: 716 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in April <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th: The integrated war results of the Japanese Army and Navy units in attacking and intercepting enemy air forces in April are as follows: Enemy losses: In the South Pacific, 232 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 12 unconfirmed), and 101 were destroyed. In the Central Pacific, 147 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 6 unconfirmed), and 54 were destroyed. In Burma, 74 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 25 unconfirmed), and 66 were destroyed and burned. In China, 20 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 20 were destroyed and burned. In the North Pacific, 1 enemy aircraft was shot down and 1 was destroyed. The above totals 716 aircraft (including 43 unconfirmed). Japanese losses: 90 aircraft failed to return after bombing. 85 aircraft were damaged, totaling 175 aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The decisive air battle in the East Asian War is becoming more intense day by day. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the various Japanese front lines in April totaled 24,097, setting a record since the beginning of the war. The Japanese Army and Navy air force teams, in close cooperation, from the North Kuriles in the north to New Guinea in the south, and from the Marshall Islands in the east to India in the west, cooperated with ground troops in this vast area, escorting convoys, attacking enemy bases, and intercepting incoming enemy aircraft. With a small number of troops, they continued to fight bravely day and night. In April, they shot down 470 enemy aircraft and destroyed 242 enemy aircraft, totaling 716 enemy aircraft annihilated. The results of the battle were remarkable. 90 Japanese aircraft failed to return after bombing, and 85 were damaged on the ground, totaling 175 aircraft lost. A summary of the battles on each front line is as follows:</p>
<p>South Pacific</p>
<p>The air battle on the New Guinea front was the most intense. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked in March was 3,725, and in April it increased sharply to 5,302. In order to respond to the new landing operations in Hollandia and Aitape on April 22, the enemy, with the army, navy, and air force integrated, attempted to break through the Japanese strategic money in that area. The fight on that front will then tend to worsen. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked Bandara in March was 165, and in April it increased sharply to 970, indicating the enemy's intentions in that area. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked Bougainville Island in March was 6,050, and in April it decreased to 3,254. The enemy, in view of the Japanese army's major offensive near Torokina in March, concentrated the main force of the South Pacific air force on that front, and then entered a state of war. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Bismarck Archipelago remained frequent. The Japanese army greeted the incoming enemy aircraft day and night. The battle results on the Rabaul front were 232 enemy aircraft shot down and 101 enemy aircraft destroyed.</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the Japanese-held islands in the Central Pacific in April reached 3,062, which is sufficient to prove the enemy's strong war intention. The battle results in that area were 147 enemy aircraft shot down and 14 enemy aircraft destroyed.</p>
<p>Burma Front</p>
<p>As the Japanese army advanced into India, the enemy mobilized its existing air force and attacked repeatedly. The number of aircraft that attacked in April reached 7,364, double that of March. The Japanese army air force shot down and destroyed 140 of them (25 of which were unconfirmed), mostly large transport aircraft, Dc3, totaling 34. When the enemy was actively supplying the enemy troops encircled in Imphal and the airborne troops landing in northern Burma, the Japanese air force shot down so many transport aircraft, which was a major blow to the enemy.</p>
<p>China Front</p>
<p>The number of enemy aircraft that came in April was 296, which was less than the number of aircraft that came in March. The number of aircraft that came in March was 383. The reason for this was that the Japanese army launched an offensive operation against India, and part of it had to be transferred to the Indian front. However, due to this Henan operation, the enemy's activities may become active again. The Japanese air force's battle in that area resulted in the destruction of 20 aircraft.</p>
<p>North Pacific</p>
<p>Due to the completion of the enemy base in the Aleutians and the improvement of the weather, the number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April doubled compared to March, reflecting the gradually tightening situation in that area.</p>
<p>Thai-Vietnamese Front</p>
<p>The enemy's air raids on that area are still limited to guerrilla warfare. The number of aircraft that came was not much different from the previous month. Looking at the enemy's air raid situation as a whole, the number of enemy aircraft that came in March was 18,329. In April, it was 24,097, an increase of 5,768 compared to March. The above-mentioned air battles have now become the center of the war situation, and the enemy's air raids on the South Pacific and Burma will become more intense.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's sweeping offensive on the western section of the Longhai Railway has given Chongqing a major impact. A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing reported: "The fate of Luoyang is decided. The war has now advanced to 15 kilometers south of Luoyang City, and its fall is only a matter of time." A United Press staffer, based on frontline news, reported: "The Japanese army south of Luoyang City has advanced another 5 kilometers and is now only 9 kilometers from Luoyang." According to another Reuters telegram, the Chongqing government issued a war report on the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the 8th, saying: "The Japanese army moving south from the Beijing-Hankou Railway has occupied Xiping and is now advancing towards Suiping, 45 kilometers south of Yancheng."</p>
<p>Suizhou, 9th (Central News Agency) - A spokesman for the Chongqing Military Commission met with a group of foreign journalists and released the following information on the war situation in Henan: The Japanese army is attacking from the north and south in Henan. The distance between the two armies has progressed from 200 kilometers to about 100 kilometers. The northern army has now reached Yancheng, and the southern army has reached Queshan. If they continue to attack, their goal will not be difficult to achieve. It is expected that a major battle will take place in the western Henan plain. If the Chongqing army is defeated at that time, the important towns in western Henan, such as Luoyang, will also be lost. The threat to Chongqing is unimaginable.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reported: Since the 8th, two facts in this week's war situation are most worthy of our attention. First, after the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive between the Prut River and Moldavia and downstream of the Dniester River, it encountered failure and has not been seen in any movement. Second, the anti-axis air force's air raids on Europe have had to use dense clouds for cover this week. The German military authorities also said that the reason why the Eastern Front has been able to maintain a calm state is due to the excessive losses of the Soviet army. This is certainly due to the cooperation of the Romanian army, but at the same time, the German army's new attack tactics have also made a great contribution. The German army's specially made dive bombers equipped with anti-tank guns have an amazing effect on attacking tank formations. This tactic has been adopted by the German army since this spring. In future large-scale operations, it is expected to achieve great results.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Japan's Shipbuilding Industry Achieves Rapid Progress; 10,000-Ton Ships Can Be Completed in a Few Dozen Days <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japan's shipbuilding plan for the 18th year has been completed, and the results have been more than double those of the 17th year. The planned production for the 19th year is expected to increase to two and a half times that of the 18th year, provided that labor and materials proceed smoothly. Under the guidance of the Naval Affairs Department and the management of the Shipbuilding Control Association, laborers have united and are making continuous progress. The shipbuilding industry in the 18th year has shown rapid progress. It started in response to the massive shipbuilding increase plan decided by the extraordinary session of the Diet in May of the 17th year. However, at that time, many non-standard ships were still under construction in various shipyards, so the results in that year were not very satisfactory, and shipbuilding capacity was not fully utilized. By the 18th year, most of the old ships of various companies had been completed, and all new plans had been established, and rapid progress has been made. The main contents are as follows: To thoroughly increase shipbuilding production and save materials, the basic wartime ship type regulations have been changed since the 18th year. The results have exceeded expectations. For example, it used to take about ten months to manufacture a 10,000-ton ship, but after the change, it can be completed in an average of a few dozen days in the shortest time. Since last year, the shipbuilding industry has been listed as one of the five major essential industries, and materials and labor have been given priority allocation. At the same time, the labor system has been changed to a day and night shift system, so its effectiveness has been greatly increased. Recently, in view of the increasing severity of the war, the morale of the laborers is also becoming stronger. For example, workers have recently been spending the night in the factories, embodying the true spirit of sleepless and tireless work by so-called day and night supervision.</p>

It is reported that after arriving in Shanghai, these personnel first summoned leaders of major daily necessities factories to inquire about the general situation of each factory, and separately went to the major match factories and soap manufacturing factories in the city to inspect the current production situation on the ground. They conducted detailed research on the soundness of equipment, the improvement of technology, the adjustment of electricity and manpower, and the adjustment of raw materials, and how to increase production. The entire plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval and implementation. They are now continuing to supervise the paper mills and glass factories in the city to increase production, and will go to the field for inspections separately starting today (10th). They will study concrete investigation plans based on the results of the inspections to promote business development.

The government authorities designate factories in various places to start manufacturing, and non-designated factories (i.e., factories that have been reviewed by the government and deemed illegal) will be shut down. It is reported that this centralized cooperative production plan has been agreed in principle by the factory owners, and the relevant authorities have also agreed to support it.</p>
