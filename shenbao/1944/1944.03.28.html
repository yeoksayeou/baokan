<p>社評</p>
<h3>再向社會富有人士進言</h3>
<p>十六日本報，發表衣長風君「市民應担負改善戰時警察生活的責任」一文，我們很同意長風君的主張：　合作社應包括全市驚察，不應限於一區。　營運資金應擴充至一萬萬元，由警察當局邀請金融界組織銀團，予以低利貸款，並商請中儲准以半數轉做貼放，以購人貨品為担保，並由區公署負承還保證責任。　要求統制機關經常配給各種日用品，應予以採辦之便利。長風君並說：「拿事業的前途，和地方治安的關係來作一分析，認淸環境，放大眼光，並充分發揮同情的精神，勿以一身一業為衆矢之的」。我們認為這些都是非常正確的見解。</p>
<p>自從本月十六日第一警察當局招待各界，發起組織警察消費合作社以後，我們即認定這一舉指，直接是改善警察生活，間接即是增加維護治安的力量，確保上海治安。亦即是保護上海市民的事業財產，尤其是富有人士。因此，我們在二十三，四兩日的社評中，竭力贊叻促成，並向社會富有人士進言。</p>
<p>頃悉驚察當局為籌集資金問題，今天下午再度邀請本市各業領袖會商決定。我們木於一貫的熱情，再向各界領袖進數言。</p>
<p>全市警察約有二萬人，連同警察家屬約共十萬人，一個五口之家的開支，照目前物價估計，至少需要五千元。現在驚察月俸所入平均一千餘元，僅及支出四分之一，其餘四分之三落了空：於此，誠如長風君所說：「現在社會各方面的論調都一致不滿意警察的服務精神，他方面卻不肯悉心研究精神退化的重大原因。其結果非特於事無補，更適足以債事。」我們必須針對警察服務精神退化的原因，先行設法消減，然後責望驚察提高服務精神，才有實效，才算合理。現在警察消費合作社的組織，就是針對退化原因而消滅之一法，是我們大家的責任，既經當局倡導，自應共同贊助，協力促成。</p>
<p>依照警察連家屬十萬人計箏，合作社資金一萬萬元，假定全部購備物品，每月配給驚察，每人得一千元物品，根據上面估計的開支，僅夠維持。不過，事實上貨物進出，周轉流通，在時間上與數量上不能達到最高效能。則一萬萬元資金並不算多。</p>
<p>一萬萬元資金，驟視之或覺膨大，其實照目前物價並不算大，況且，我們見到過去各種　企業公司地產公司創立時，資金動輒一萬萬以至三萬萬元，而廣告甫刊，咄嗟可成，並不感覺困難。究其內容，多數是空頭投機。今合作社借款，有利息，有担保，不應退縮不前。</p>
<p>老實說，近年經營商業及投機致富者頗不乏人，此際稍稍默想，我們的生活怎樣，從而聯想到警察的生活怎樣，發揮些同情之心。治安是整個的，有了整個治安，才能保持個人的安全，保鑣與鐵門，在整個治安有間題時，是無多用處的。所以，希望富有人士認淸整個治安與警察生活的關係，與個人事業財產的關係，而竭力贊助。</p>
<p>很多殷富而平素與社會絕少接觸，或不問公益者，這次應由社會領袖盡力督促，勸勉發生熱忱。其實，警察保護者，還以這般人士受惠最多，尤應多多資助。</p>
<p>最後，警察消費合作社的成立，已刻不容緩，希望在這次茶會中，決定一切，最短期內，從速成立。同時我們可以從道個警察合作社籌集資金一事，窺見社會領袖與富有人士對於社會公益事業的熱心如何？更可以窺見對於維護上海治安與大東亞戰爭的理解如何？</p>

<h3>鮑斯主席　電謝日首相</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電日東條首相兼陸相，以印度國民軍與日軍相協力，突破印度國境，開始向祖國進擊，為表示慶祝起見，日前特致電飽斯主席致賀，鮑斯主席於二十六日電覆東條首相及陸相，表示謝意，玆誌其大美之共同目的起見，承貴國之協力與援助，鄙人特代表印度民衆及印度國民軍，對貴國及閣下之厚意深為感謝。又印度國民軍決與貴國軍隊一致努力，作戰到底，直至獲得最後</p>
<h3>長驅攻陷梯迭姆日軍獲莫大戰果　半月殲滅英印軍一師團</h3>
<p>仰光二十七日中央社電敵英印軍第十七師一萬人，盤據頓扎恩附近，企圖在舉丘陵地帶反攻緬甸，但自某軍事據點陷落以後，已完全被殱。同時與印軍於攻略敵軍前衛要塞以後，並以破竹之勢向北挺進，繼向頓扎恩南方三十公里之敵軍要塞猛攻。另一路日軍，抵梯迭姆東方約七公里地帶以後，即向梯迭姆加以砲擊，另一路日軍二十日完全攻略梯迭姆北方要衝頓扎恩後，並將敵軍退路完全切斷，到歲殲減企圖遁走之敵，刻正緊縮其範圍圈中。二十一日，日軍復以夜製戰，突破敵軍主要要塞，長驅攻入梯迭姆，即將其完全攻下。目下屯軍正急於掃蕩遁入密林地帶之殘敵，日軍此次攻陷敵軍第十七師據點梯迭姆以後，衆料其必將截獲敵軍自動貨車砲。重輕機關槍，彈藥等，而收獲莫大戰果。同時，日軍於三月八日開始圍殲敵軍以來，為時僅十五日，已殲減敵軍一帥團之大部隊（一師團一萬人），此使日印同盟軍之士氣益形旺盛，其最足悲者，獗為敵車在辛澤瓦盆地及　丘陸方面之慘敗</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電據印度日軍前綫某基地電，此次日軍先發制人，在南起日溪克達富貢千餘公里之阿拉坎戰綫，展開進攻作戰，英印軍第七及第十七兩師團即全被毀減，中部印緬戰綫方面，因東印最大軍事據點仁巴爾危機迫切，敵奪回緬甸之企圖全成書餅，更因優勢之日印同盟軍進攻馬尼布爾平原，以北部富貢戰錢之駐印渝軍三個師為主體之渝美聯軍背部，亦受或脅，運輸路之開通，於茲即吿失望。英。美之空輸部隊，不過為圖買得渝方歡心之輕舉妄動，該空輸部隊於戰路上亦全陷於孤立，反成為日軍之好餌，結果愈使渝方恐慌。美國現加強駐渝美空軍，並為增強駐印美軍，乃大事宣傳，刻已着手向印度輸送美木國軍，英美雖極力懷柔渝方，然迄未奏效，渝雲南有力之遠征軍，依然不顧印度之危機，按兵不動，故渝英美三國之關係愈形複雜微妙。此亦為反軸心陣營再感苦腦之問題。</p>
<h3>渝共雙方　摩擦益深刻　對憲政問題意見紛歧</h3>
<p>中央社訊據可靠方而消息，渝方於去歲召開國民黨第十一中全會中議決要案多項，中有（一）於戰爭結束一年以後，召開國民大會，實行制憲。（二）以政治途徑解決國共問題。但就此兩問題來觀，國共意見歧異，共黨則主張以民主辦法解決國共關係，而後加強團結，爭取戰爭勝利，以完成建國。關於憲政問題，共黨方面對主張之異同尚不計及，最耍者乃渝方之有無誠意。蓋淪國民黨會二度提及憲政問題，第一次在民國二十八年舉行六中全會時，答覆當時參政會關於定期實施憲政之提議時，決定於民國二十九年十一月十二日，召集國民大會，制定憲法。然國民黨方面迄今猶未付諸實現。第二次即於去年十一中全會時，議決於戰爭結束一年以後，召開國民大會，實行　　之故也，共黨方面以為『他們巳經實行民主主義，例如共黨之邊區政府，暨華中，華北、各「抗戰」根據地，已實行所謂革命的三民主義及民主主義。所以共黨方而主張實行憲政有三先決條件：（一）保障人民的民主自由，即人民居住，集會結社，言論，出版等自由。（二）開放黨禁，要求承認各黨各派在中國之合法地位，所謂合法即不將國民黨以外其他各黨視為奸黨，並不得限制或禁止他們以切築在「抗日」民主範園中之活動。（三）實行地方自治。就上述各節觀之，我人即可見渝共雙方為憲政問題之意見紛歧，摩擦益趨於深刻化。同時渝方其他各黨派之對「實行憲政」問題之意見，亦紛歧不一。如中國靑年黨要人左舜生，接近國社黨之楊衛玉，均有意見發表。但渝國民黨當局為避免共黨發動政治攻勢十二月底，重慶中央日報及掃蕩報，強調民主國防，守法，等種種口號，以抵制民主要求之氣焰。（二）中央日報云，為民主起見，絕對不能容忍個人自由主義。（三）掃蕩報警吿，論文中要求憲政實施協進會員，作更進一步之認識。（四）二月廿三日渝中央社社論，竟公然反對民主主義。（五）渝方若干報紙，若載有要求人民之自由，與言論自由之新開，輒於製版後奉令檢去。（六）新華日報亦公然載稱，一月下旬各地憲政運動，被當局壓迫，致使憲政問題陷於沉滯狀態。並且大部份人民都反對秘密逮捕，及濫用私爭結束一年以後，召開國民大會，實行憲政，雖為一般人民所歡迎，但淪方憂於共黨之政治攻勢，不得不施以彈壓手段，因此渝共雙方以憲政問題為中心，重行發生極大摩擦。又據共黨方面表示，渝國民黨於十一中全會議決，以政治來解決國共問題，要求共黨履行民國廿六年九月廿二日，共赴國難之宣言中之四條件，但共黨方面宜稱，早已實行，並反提五項條件：（一）國民黨應承認共黨在全國合理之地位。（二）承認邊區及各抗敵根據地為其地方政府。（三）承認八路軍新四軍及一切後方軍隊，為其所管轄隸屬部隊。（四）恢復新四軍之番號。（五）撒銷對陝甘寗各抗戰根據地之封鎖及包國。並云國共兩黨倘能本此基本條件，推誠相見，公平合理，始能解決一切問題云云。我人觀諸上項條件，渝方必不能予以同意，則其間雙方之摩擦，自可預料。</p>
<h3>越南輸日物資　已全部商妥　雙方昨正式簽訂協定</h3>
<p>河內二十七日中央社電日本與越南當局，依據日。越經濟協定，對於木年度應實施之條款，自本年一月五日在西貢訂立越南供米協定後，繼續在西貢及河內進行交涉，現越南方面輸出物資全部之最後商談，曾經日駐越屋田總領事與越南經濟局長麥爾頓進行交涉，巳於二十七日上午十一時在越總督府正式簽字。同時日。越興方發表共同聲明，按去年度之日。越之經濟條款，係於八月十九日簽字，木年度巳縮短交涉期間五個月，交涉進行極順利，顯示決戰期間日。越協力關係之密切化，殊堪注目也。</p>
<h3>爪哇增強運輸　築橡皮公路</h3>
<p>爪加爾達二十七日中央社電　爪哇方面為增強運輸，刻正試築橡皮公路，並造牛車，所謂橡皮公路，係以橡皮層和以焦油及天然樹脂，作為土瀝青之代用品而舖築者，頃在爪加爾達市內從事試驗，一俟試驗成功，證明其確可耐熱耐久，即將用以修築島內一方公里之公路。至於牛車係為局地運輸用，由各州廳撥給補助金，大事建造，擬造成新牛車一萬輛。又陸路運輸總局亦已準備製造新牛車一萬輛。</p>

<h3>自由印臨時政府連日開重要會議　廣泛討論解放地域各問題</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電緬甸日軍某基地電，自由印度臨時政府接得國民軍突破國境之捷報後，即於二十日召開緊急會議，對解放地域之行政等間題，作種種協議，當決定在印度境內建立新國家，以解放地城為領土，而踏出光輝行政之第一步。二十一日江特拉鮑斯主席對印度及全世界廣播，發表關於國民軍進攻印度之聲明，要求祖國民衆援助日印同盟單，並妨害英美軍戰力，參加印度國民軍。並闡明自由印度臨時政府担任解放地域行政之趣旨，想此舉對於全世界及全印度定有莫大影醫。又在比之先，自由印度臨時政府曾特派薩哈伊書記長及其他政府要人赴前錢，對解放地區着手調查，國境突破後，即刻命令於某地等待機之政府要人速行前進，目下被等正在解放地區開始作種種活動。又自由印度臨時政府於召開緊急閣議後，並連日舉行重要會議，對經濟。文化各方面作廣泛協議，均得成案，就中最可注目者，為對於解放地區民族及卡時特（印度基於傳統之宗教職業上而生之一　族藉）之方針，決定凡屬印人不分貴賤，負同等之義務，亭同等之權利，推翻英國積年實施之分離統制辦法，扶植起種族超階級所請印度人之印度之觀念，對卡時特族則漸次改正其缺點。又自田印度臨時政府所以仍冠臨時字樣者，欲待四億同胞完全解放後，由全印度人之總意再行樹立新印度政府。</p>
<h3>德百萬青年　向元首效忠　儀式隆重意義重大</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電德國新聞社訊：德繼，當時由德靑年團領袖愛克斯曼向彼等述說此項儀式之意義。渠稱所謂隊元首宣誓一舉，原為德青年男女對其父母表示感激之意，尤其德國之一般母親，在此艱苦困難之時代，更應得其兒童之感激與親愛。德靑年之感恩，不但應在言語文字中表明之，更須在每日之生活中表一示之。愛克斯曼鄭重宣稱，「爾等在家中隊父母之模範態度，即為對勝利之貢獻，爾等之教訓，亦須在爾等感激之列，蓋因誠態之友人與同志，正在教導爾等如何忍受未來之一切磨練」。埃克斯曼未稱，德青年領袖亦期望各位青年男女完成爾等隊希特勒靑年之責任。</p>

<p>柏林二十七日中央社電蘇軍於東綫南部頻行進攻，因之東南歐局勢亦漸行重大化。保加利亞國會特於二十一日至二十五日間召開大會，審議軍政重要國策。閉會時總理波傑洛夫會宜讀攝政基利爾之感言，並作演說謂，反軸心軍為沮喪保加利亞國民戰意，對我王宮泰半破壞，我保國官民對此種戰爭方法，無不深惡痛絕。刻下我保加利亞股民為謀祖國將來之幸福，必須有愈加忍辱負重之決心，保加利亞國民應明　此重大戰局　保持冷靜以突一破難關。</p>
<p>索菲亞二十七日中央社電海通社訊：保加之政策，為中於對德國之同盟，因此保加利亞對德態度始終如一，保加利亞對其地盟國與友邦之政策，亦屬如是，議會完全贊成外長之主張。</p>
<h3>戰事蔓延至國境　羅馬尼亞準備應變　徵召後備兵疏散居民</h3>
<p>羅京二十七日中央社電據海通社特派員享利熙博士稱：蘇軍向布格河及護斯特河推進之結果，羅馬尼亞已準備在物質上及精神上應付此項危機。關於物質之準備，因軍事秘密，知者甚少，但由陸長潘大齊將軍昨在報上之命令。即可獲知一二，據該命令所有後備官佐及下士階級官佐，男子二十五歲至四十歲自一九四一年六月二十二日以來未人伍或未服勞役四十五日者，自四月一日至十五日止須至最近之徽券局報導。同時次間警察局亦發表命令，制定京城居民疏散後所應到之地方，大都為城郊之村落，會塡申請書者將予收容，俾得免受空襲之危險。由德軍公佈後，羅果民衆始知戰事已發生於羅國境內，即沙羅基及波蘭蒂之間。羅果各報一致表示，倘能團結必能解決種種困難，同時並　民眾鎮靜及守紀律。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍採取　彈性防禦戰　退出南部兩要城</h3>
<p>柏林廿七日中央社軍德元首行營廿六日發表：德軍在貝伏曼斯克（Pervomaisk）迄勃海第（Brody）東方之戰綫上，發生熾烈之防禦戰，此次戰鬥中德軍已由巴爾蒂及波羅斯科洛夫撤退。電據海通社訊：波羅斯科洛夫與泰諾波爾間有激烈之戰事。蘇軍司令部出動大　之輕坦克車與機械化步兵。通過該兩城間之裂口向南進攻，以圖搖動德軍在布格河與聶斯特河間之陣地。德軍司令部採取一貫之　性防禦戰術，將波羅斯科洛夫（Proks父吿失敗。蘇軍目前之目標顯在　勒（Seret）河，該河在運輸給養方面具有軍事上之價值。布格河中遊之戰事，巳不若前日之激烈，戰事之重心已移至北面，蘇眾繼續向西進攻，德軍擊已退出聶斯特與普魯斯（Pruth）河間之巴爾蒂城（Balil），蘇軍在布格河下游再度渡河未逞。東路中北兩路之戰事，除維特勃斯克區之第三次攻防戰在進行中外，他處僅有局部戰事，蘇軍在維特勃斯克之進攻並不猛烈，即德軍輕易擊退。德偵察機探得蘇軍集中大軍於考維爾區與勃萊斯特立托夫斯克東南之地域，是證蘇軍將在該區準備大舉。</p>
<h3>卡西諾前綫　發動新攻勢　英第八軍增援</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電德國　聞社訊；卡西諾區之德軍，曾於二十四日予敵以大打擊，故京拉克將軍刻正重整陣容。二十五日敵之攻勢已呈頓挫狀態。二十六日美軍因得英第八軍之增援，已第二次開始大攻勢。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾　廣播演說</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電海通社得英方消息：英相邱吉爾昨夜發表廣播演說，歷時四十七分，略謂倘蘇聯友邦未能認　渡海及從事大規模海陸戰爭之困難及複雜情形。但余需警吿諸君者，吾人為挫敗敵人，自需出以種種偽飾手段，使之迷離萬　。惟余亦未能保證其言。一輩未負重任之著名活動情形曰，吾人在巴爾幹及東地中海尚需努力為印度洋戰爭相同。</p>
<h3>反軸心傷病兵　逾十七萬　自各戰塲撤退</h3>
<p>里斯木二十七日中央社電據華盛頓息美陸軍部昨發表：一九四三年內美軍用飛機自世界各處，撒退美軍與其他反軸心軍傷病兵士一七三·〇〇〇人，是證反軸心軍在各戰塲死傷之重大。其自各主要戰塲撤退傷病兵士如下：新幾內亞七〇·入〇八人，所羅門羣島二三七六七人，突尼西亞西西里與義國五八。四七九人。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦　局勢不靖</h3>
<p>安加拉二十七日中央社電據海通社訊：勸斯坦局勢不靖，官方前在若干重要城鎮宣布緊狀態，今已擴慶至其他域，大小城市均有衝突事發生，惟其消息均嚴泄漏。聞海發之猶太人以陣碍物置於其市長之仕宅前，防止驚察入室搜查</p>
<h3>統一科學技術戰綫</h3>
<p>前綫的將兵道樣呼籲着：「雖然有機會，但是沒有飛機。」或者說：『飛機數量若增業現在的二倍，一定勝利。」對此後方應該趕快增產飛機，使美英的總反攻失敗，而使戰局好轉。如果坐失戰機，那麼勝利的戰爭，也勝不成，所以應注視戰局的迫切重大，敵我正在第一綫以航空科學相搏，近代戰爭是科學的戰爭，故應加速統一及強化我們的科學按術戰綫</p>
<h3>新兵器的研究</h3>
<p>欲急速增產優秀飛機，制勝敵軍，其基礎乃科學技術統一總動員與研究成果的生產化，換言之，除生產技術向上以外，別無方法。那麼由這航空機的質量兩，缺點尚多，第一科學技術的水準及其躍鎚速度，不許樂觀，第二為生產力根幹的生產技術，其大部份乃自外國輸入與模傚，還未確立日本的性格。第三對於國家目的，尚無有效適切的動員。</p>
<h3>設置研究動員會議</h3>
<p>對於這些缺點，不消說政府也置諸腦後，昭和十六年（即民國三十年）五月，閣議決定科學按術新體制確立要　，規曰據此項決定，創設技術院，或輔助研究機關，指導生產技術，處理外國特許，強制實施國內特許，傳授及着及優秀技術等，推進行政措施。又於去年八月在閣議決完「確立科學技術動員綜合方策」。根據此項決定，在內閣總理大臣之下，設置研究動員會議。決議中稱：「以迅速強化航空戰力為中心，求科學技術動員之澈底，綜有　科學技術的軍官民的研究體制，實行綜合能力的整備，以求發揮其總方，而確立　研究成果迅速戰力化　方策。決定國家必要的研究題目：認為最適當的人，任為「戰時研究員」委諾研究工作、於是研究動員會議為科學技術動員的最高而且一元的中櫃機開。直接根據軍部的要求，選定研究的課題，雖急急於研究口的人選，但在這緊　的戰揮最高能奪。原來日本的科學技術研究陣營，可舉出大學，專門學校的研究機關，獨立的研究機號，各省所屬的試騐研究機關、及軍有機關研究機關等，其他有網羅科學技術者的各種學協會等。這些研究機關，學協會各自獨立，不但沒有緊密的連絡，甚至其監瞥富局亦分為陸軍，，海軍、軍　省，文部省。所以有如下幾個缺點。</p>
<p>有限的研究員，資材，設備，對於同一的研究題目。重複傾注。而且互相的研究成果，採取極度的秘密主義</p>
<p>各方面對於有名的研究家，爭先委託研究，而有能力尚未出名的人，雖有熱心研究，但卻不能接受緊急的研究課題。</p>
<p>為研究機關的管理者，所屬生產公司首腦部或研究經紀人等，作中間斡為者，作無理解與割據主義的妨礙。對於第一綫活潑的靑壯年研究者的研究，沒有充分發揚熱情。</p>
<p>文部省對於內閣的研究動員會議，設置學術研究會議，預算一千八百多萬元，預定勸員文部省關係的研究機關與研究者。</p>
<h3>美國的研究動員體制</h3>
<p>敵人美團的研究動員體議機關的國防研究委員會（路稱N·D·R·Ｃ·委員長為哈佛大學校長康奈特），再有行政機關為大總統直屬之緊急管理局下層機構，名為科學振　局（略稱Ｏ·Ｓ·Ｒ·Ｄ·局長為卡奈基，協會長為浦塞）及生產研究局（略稱Ｏ·Ｐ·Ｒ·Ｄ·）。科學振興局下部有科學學士院，國立研究評議會（略稱Ｎ·Ｒ·Ｃ·）包含科學技術者及專門家登錄局（略稱Ｎ·Ｒ·Ｓ·Ｐ·局長為卡麥克益爾），及國立發明評議會（會長莫德斯將軍，研究部長為凱特林克）等。在國防研究會議決定的研究課題，欲實行推進時，略有具體的即生產研究局，努力生產化，在此完成的立刻移到緊急管理局下的戰時生產局（Ｗ。Ｐ·Ｂ·局長為納爾遜），計畫大量之生產化。這樣很圓滑地統一着研究的動員。由此觀之，敵美國，急速確立總力研究動員的體制，努力大量生產新銳兵器，接濟前綫。欲加壓倒，日本應在此時斷得改善及強化研究動員體制，其具體策司分如次：</p>
<h3>研究行政的一元化</h3>
<p>第一應使研究行政澈底一元化。欲使其實現，在戰時中，應把文題。德國的各大學研究所及其他官　研究機關之指導育成，亦由航空省或空軍元師木林直屬的研究評議會從事担任。陸海軍的研究機關，因與統帥有關，故另外置之，在研究動員會議，以圖調整官民研究機開。研究動員會議興學術研究會議，原以統一為理想，惟如未能實現，則就學術研究會議，對於研究課題的央定與研究實施，應與研究動員會議協議商榷，避免重複，而加以萬無一失的調整。</p>
<p>第二由此強化的技術院總裁，選選有才幹統合技術，生產與政治的人物，為國務大臣，列席閣譏。現在的日本政治可謂閣議中心主義，所以絕對需要確立代表科學技術陣營，可以在閣議就重要間題發言的機構。不過對於這點，另有由軍需生產與技衛直接連絡，把技術迅速活用到生產面的見解，主張技術院應為軍　省之外廓，但這種意見，其總裁亦有担任國務大臣之必要。</p>
<h3>制定研究管理法</h3>
<p>第三應制定研究管理法，對於眞實的科學技術之研究和研究者，澈底權立國家管理體制。關於此點有人主張活用研究動員會議及戰時研究員的制度，可見成效。更有人謂這不是百分之百發揮研究員的創意辦法。但若沒有發展到這個地步。豈非不能全面的動員研究陣的總力。</p>
<p>於是最高審議機關的研究動員會議，經由軍部，與作戰直接速結，選定研究課題，漸次動員官民的研究員，充分傾注資材與資金，如促進技術院一元的研究，便可使科學按術者的研究意　，具發有效地結合國家的要求，與前綫連結一條血脈，成為鞏固的決戰體制。在現在的經濟諸情勢下，已經不能漫狀態擴張生產設施並增加勞動人員，濫　原料和材料。即不能再採取向來的生產方式。應確立適應戰局的一元總力研究勸員體制，無論在航空機，或電波兵器，或於其他的兵器　，達到可以完全制勝敵方的程度，由責現質量的大增產，來澈底粉碎、敵方總反攻。重申一句：詩不可失，亟起圖之　。（弘：譯自二月十四日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>加強保甲效能</h3>
<p>昨天第一警察局保田處招待各界領袖及保甲高級人員，報吿保甲設施，並徽詢推進工作意見。出席老極為踴躍，於此可見各界對於保甲事宜的熱心。</p>
<p>保甲制度，在我國創始很早，推行的地方也很多。依據歷史經驗，鄉邨地方成效較易。上海是人口多而五方雜處的都市，在推行保甲制度之初，或謂不易有效。可是，二年以來的事實，卻反證了這種觀念。保甲制度，幫助了許多維護治安的工作，協力了許多驚察的任務。最顯著的，就是恐怖案件的滅少。這是二年來地方警察與　間保甲合作精神的表現，很可賓貴的功效。</p>
<p>然而，目前大東亞戰局愈益接近決勝階段，上海是後方的重要基地，敵人的破壞陰諜亦將　肆蠢動，所以，維護上海治安的責任也愈益艱鉅，一方面期待加強警察的服務精神，一方面同樣需要加強保甲的服務精神，協力驚察，幫助軍憲，維護治安。</p>
<p>協助維議治安最切實者，就是自警團員，值崗時固應守望相助；退崗時尤應隨時防止與檢舉奸宄，使宵小無法潛跡。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>第二個樂觀因素</h3>
<p>上星期大本市四大　體歡迎田尻公使茶會席上之田尻公使贈言中，說起三個樂觀因素，而於經濟因素則謂：「戰時經濟狀況，本來沒有完全自由的可能；既在戰時，原不許可無戰時情緒；現在中日兩國人士都已逐漸了解這個意義，這是第二個樂觀因素。」</p>
<p>這「第二個樂觀因素」，（第一個是中國政訟治巳經見過有廉潔的趨向，第三個是中日對於日本對華新政策的理念已經遂漸趨於一致）嚴格地說，並不是基於戰時經濟所已經獲到的什麽優良成績，而是其於綁濟界人士對戰時經濟意義的逐漸了解。</p>
<p>來充實這樣一個樂觀信念，我們可以把最近上海市工商業領袖所發起細織的中國實業協會來說一說。實業協會的構成者，多為生產事業的負責人士，也可以說有力人士，既為生產界的負責與有力人士，那末，今後他們所當協力於經濟上的戰時情緒者，自積極方面　，是努力強化產業機構，增進生產速度，把各處工廠四起的吹烟，來象繼戰時積極生產的情緒；自消極方面言，是竭力避免一切　獲非法利得的作風，消除壓來樂於近利的思想，把各人的眼光放遠放大，夾表現戰時犧牲小我提偏大我的情緒。這樣兩個戰時情緒的混合，便可以為全國經濟中心的上海，種下振興與繁榮的果實。因此，我們從今以後所希望於中國實業協會者，便可以作為這「第二個樂觀因素」，的一個解釋。</p>
<h3>十一家銀行辦理　華中北匯兌　即日起禁止聯鈔黑市</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行以近來本市因不正當之投機，發生聯鈔之黑市，該項黑市與正式兌換寧相差　殊，為促鎚華中與華北之物資及資金之交流發展，便利正當交易起見，自昨（廿七）日起禁止一切金融業經營中儲券興聯鈔兌換買賣，除暫行規定旅客攜帶通貨兌換及對華匯款最高限度為中備券五千元外，並指定中國，交通·金城·大睦·浙江興業。浙江實業·上海商業儲蓄·中南·鹽業等九華商銀行及日商正金·朝鮮兩銀行為辦理華北匯款銀行。</p>
<p>茲悉中儲銀行特於昨（二十七）日上午十一時在上海分行召集各該銀行負責人開談話會，由該行副總裁錢大　說明意義，並交換意見，確定辦理南北匯兌手續及收取匯歟人匯費，每百元中儲券暫收匯費一元，如各該行需要聯鈔頭寸，中　　量予以供給，並希各該行今後辦理聯鈔匯兌，　須注意勿被投機者之利用。茲將錢副總栽談話錄後：</p>
<h3>錢氏談話</h3>
<p>食中儲劵與　鈔之兌換，堅持以百　對十八元之兌換比率，實為中國經濟建全發展上之必要措置，已毋庸　述。華中與華北間之物資及資金之交流，固應以此項比率為標準，其運用乃得圓滑，中備與聯銀雙方為此曾迭謀週宜之處置，當為社會人士所週知。</p>
<p>近來因不正當之投機致有聯鈔之黑市發生，該項黑市與正式兌換率相差懸殊，當局對此極為　憾，會覺有嚴重取締之必要，乃決定按照一百元對十八元之率，收買金融業所有之聯鈔，同時並禁止一切金融　今後經營中　券與聯鈔之兌換買資。然當局對正常交易則擴盡量予以便利，俾華中華北間之經濟得以綜合發展，自不待言，故擬　　使兩地間旅客携帶通貨，兌換　額之限制　以緩和，兩地間匯款之限制，亦得相　程度之解決。現在正與　北當局折　，養定辦法，將來照公定比率，微收少數手續費，在可能數標範　內，准予自由通匯，此層不久當可實現。</p>
<p>茲暫行規定旅客攜帶逋貨兌換及對華北匯款上最高限度為中　券五千元，並指　下列十一行為辦理華北匯款銀行：中南，鹽業，金城，大陸，浙江興業，浙江實業，上海商業儲蓋，中國交通，正金，期鮮，上開各行如要求本行照公定之一百元對十八元比率套　，本行當照辦，此次之措置實行以後。非法買賣即可鏟除，而同時正當交易便利頗多，在堅持百元對十入元比率下，兩地之物資及資金，固意中事也。</p>

<h3>匯劃不復存在</h3>
<p>— 唯齋</p>
<p>「匯劃」一項，最初原為隔日付現之粟據，在民廿六以後，在民三十大東亞戰事發生後，上海各商業銀行及錢莊為應付非常，維持市面計，先後有「匯劃限於同業轉賬，不能付現」之限制。至三十一年六月，中儲券巳為本市唯一通貨，通貨之放出與收縮，已全恃中儲行為適當之調節，此項現鈔與　劃的臨時界限，早已無　　除。至二十二年六月，銀行票據交換所交換差額轉賬事宜，移歸中儲行辦理，本國商業銀行對外商銀行之票據交換，由中儲行擔任，自此時起，匯劃制度早巳不復存在，任何人收人匯劃票據，均可牧得現鈔。（平行綫支票，須先託銀行錢莊收款，然後可主付現鈔，比為票據法所規定，現鈔票據及匯劇票據均係如此）故現在銀行錢莊所出票據上，雖尚有匯　字樣，實際早已與現鈔票據無異矣。</p>
<p>近來各報載新聞及評論上提及匯劃時，頗多認為匯劇至今依然存在者，殊與事實大相逕庭。惟三月二十二日新聞報經濟評論　所載「現在已經沒有匯劃貨幣」一節，頗足糾正一般之誤解。</p>
<p>考查一設所以誤解之原因，當由　行莊票據及撥款單上仍多有「匯劃」或「劃頭」兩字，殊不知此兩文字已僅存歷史的意義，已如上述，　銀行準備會每月所發表交換票據及代收數字，尚分一現鈔」及「劃頭」兩項，實際則照筆者所知，當上年六月銀行準備會將交換差額轉嚴事宜移交中儲行時，因「匯　」「現鈔」此後巳無區別，維特所有收付賬目及交換手續，原來匯劇與現鈔分別辦理者，改為合併處理，嗣因匯劃一項，在本吏面業上有悠久之歷史與習慣，明文廢止，深恐刺激市面，易滋疑慮，故形式上仍予保持。至報載對於鉅額匯劃應予處置節，殊有誤會之處也。</p>

<h3>區公署職員應與警察一視同仁</h3>
<p>— 立仁</p>
<p>抑低物價固是澈底解决生活問題的要國，而增加薪給亦是一種解除生計困苦的治標辦法，如果物價聽其上升而薪給不予增加，這種矛盾的現象，足以助長舞弊的風氣，一個商店如此，一個政府的　開亦如此，所以增加薪金是當前不可忽視的重要措置，因為生活安定以後，才能安心服務。</p>
<p>現在第一區公署和第一警察局同人的薪金，早已增加數次，第三警察局自歸併後，亦已　待遇調整。雖則對於目前的牛活指數來比較，還是相去猶鉅，但是到於調整員警的薪金，可說盡了當局一部份的責任。</p>
<p>至於前第八區公署的職員呢，到現在有入個月未會加薪，職員的收入多者千餘元。少老六七白，在這樣高貴的牛活中，這區區的收入不足以維持個人的生活。然而職員們都有家眷。如何可以簽家活口？現在一入兩區，巳於上月份　始合併，自無彼此之分，而新給仍未予以關整，用意何在？百思莫解。</p>
<p>警察是負維護治安的重大責任，但是區公署的職負亦有同樣的使命，不可厚此薄彼，而應一視同仁，加以調整。此外警同同人的消費合作社等組織。亦應普遍推行，使區公署的同人們，共事福利，才是合理的舉措，深望各界寄予同情，協力贊助。</p>

<p>天空海闊（三）</p>
<p>在舉的期間裏，也時常　着　　　，航行日本近海，但這次却不能間日而語了。在　戶內海的多島海航駛，在按　上，也或許比較困雖的，但　並不能　是海，並且棄艦的心情，也大不相同。又人門是　着醉令，而乘人此艦的，難說是　補生，但巳經是發任待過的高等武官。雖說是練習艦隊，並非只是練習便可以了事的。假使有國總不明的飛機來裝的時候，立刻就　開始戰鬥配　，而應戰的。並且傎人所乘的　手　，是日俄戰爭時，第二艦隊第二戰隊的旗　，負有在蔚山海上和日本海海戰中舊戰的名譽戰史。　齡雖老，也許是歷史的關係，其有一種特別的品格和滋味。</p>
<p>這揮軍艦上兼着精神蓬勃的候補生們，確如有舊皮囊中，盛上了新酒，艦容也要為之改變起來了。所以態　眞人們的胸中，感到名譽和責任的重惑。</p>
<p>航海的第一日，由主任指導官給介紹了士官室及士官次室的　士官·主任指導官日少佐是二個短軀，圓　，精神矍鑠的人。搭乘　手艦的候補生們，大約有半年期　的航海中，受到　地指導。海軍軍人對　注航海的指導官，是終生不能忘懷的，以後指導官成為和備役，從前的候補生雖昇為上級，也要避免坐上席的，畢竟指導官是如師如父的尊崇，士官室尤其是士官次室的士官們，說來　像哥哥一般的輪佐着主任指導官，言行俱有垂範的實任。士官們的立塲，是相當拘束的，可是其中也未必沒有破例的士官，施以　爽磊落的反療怯的。</p>
<p>皿人們的心情，好像是又回到四號生時代了，但事實却大不相同。有四號時代所沒有東西。就是有了部下。有下士官同水兵的部下。並且這些部下，都是由海兵團中選拔出來的精兵。指導官及各士官，都是經過愼重地選拔似的，下士官水兵等也到這初次有部下的候補生，加以深甚的考慮的。計　給與眞人們的首途上以好的「上官」同好的（部下）的幸福。</p>

<h3>Further Advice to the Wealthy in Society</h3>
<p>In our newspaper on the 16th, Mr. Yi Changfeng's article, "Citizens Should Bear the Responsibility of Improving the Wartime Police's Livelihood," was published. We greatly agree with Mr. Changfeng's proposition: The cooperative should encompass all police officers in the city, not be limited to one district. The operating capital should be expanded to 100 million yuan, with the police authorities inviting the financial community to organize a syndicate to provide low-interest loans, and requesting the Central Reserve Bank to approve half of it to be used for rediscounting, with purchased goods as collateral, and the district office bearing the responsibility for repayment guarantee. Requests to the controlling authorities for regular allocation of various daily necessities should be given procurement convenience. Mr. Changfeng also said, "Analyze the future of the enterprise and its relationship with local security, have a clear understanding of the environment, broaden your horizons, and fully develop a spirit of sympathy, and do not make yourself the target of public criticism for the sake of personal gain." We believe these are all very correct views.</p>
<p>Since the First Police Bureau hosted various sectors on the 16th of this month to initiate the organization of a police consumer cooperative, we have recognized that this move directly improves the police's livelihood, and indirectly increases the power to maintain public order, ensuring Shanghai's security. This is also protecting the businesses and properties of Shanghai citizens, especially the wealthy. Therefore, in our editorials on the 23rd and 24th, we have been doing our utmost to encourage its success and to advise the wealthy in society.</p>
<p>We have just learned that the police authorities, in order to raise funds, have once again invited leaders from various industries in the city to discuss and decide on a plan this afternoon. Based on our consistent enthusiasm, we would like to offer a few more words to the leaders of all sectors.</p>
<p>There are approximately 20,000 police officers in the city, and with their families, there are about 100,000 people. The expenses for a family of five are estimated to be at least 5,000 yuan based on current prices. The current average monthly salary of a police officer is only over 1,000 yuan, which is only a quarter of their expenses. The remaining three-quarters are lacking. In this regard, as Mr. Changfeng said, "The views of all sectors of society are unanimously dissatisfied with the police's service spirit, but on the other hand, they are unwilling to carefully study the major reasons for the decline in spirit. The result is not only unhelpful but also worsens the situation." We must address the reasons for the decline in the police's service spirit, first find ways to reduce them, and then expect the police to improve their service spirit, which will be effective and reasonable. The organization of the police consumer cooperative is one way to eliminate the causes of decline, and it is our common responsibility. Since the authorities have advocated it, we should all support it and work together to make it happen.</p>
<p>Based on the calculation of 100,000 people including the police and their families, if the cooperative's capital is 100 million yuan, assuming all of it is used to purchase goods and distribute them to the police every month, each person would receive 1,000 yuan worth of goods, which, based on the estimated expenses above, is barely enough to maintain their livelihood. However, in reality, the inflow and outflow of goods, and the turnover, cannot achieve maximum efficiency in terms of time and quantity. Therefore, 100 million yuan of capital is not that much.</p>
<p>100 million yuan of capital may seem huge at first glance, but in fact, it is not that large given current prices. Moreover, we have seen in the past that when various enterprises, companies, and real estate companies were established, their capital would often reach 100 million or even 300 million yuan, and the money could be raised as soon as the advertisements were published, without feeling any difficulty. In reality, most of it was speculative capital. Now, the cooperative is borrowing money with interest and collateral, so there should be no hesitation.</p>
<p>To be honest, there are quite a few people who have become wealthy in recent years through business and speculation. At this moment, take a moment to think about what our lives are like, and from there think about what the lives of the police are like, and develop some sympathy. Public order is a whole; only with the whole public order can personal safety be maintained. Bodyguards and iron gates are of little use when there are problems with the entire public order. Therefore, it is hoped that wealthy people will recognize the relationship between the entire public order and the lives of the police, and the relationship with their personal businesses and properties, and do their best to support it.</p>
<p>Many wealthy people rarely have contact with society or do not care about public welfare. This time, community leaders should do their best to urge and encourage them to develop enthusiasm. In fact, those who benefit the most from the protection of the police are these people, and they should provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, the establishment of the police consumer cooperative is now imminent. It is hoped that everything will be decided at this tea party and that it will be established as soon as possible. At the same time, we can get a glimpse of how enthusiastic community leaders and wealthy people are about public welfare by considering the matter of raising funds for this police cooperative. Furthermore, we can see how well they understand the importance of maintaining Shanghai's security and the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Goes to Japan for Medical Treatment, Health Gradually Recovering; State Affairs Temporarily Handled by Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fo Hai</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Propaganda Department issued the following public announcement at 2 p.m. on March 27th: Chairman Wang suffered from chest, back, and flank pain last winter, and underwent surgery on December 19th to remove a bullet from his back, which he had been wounded by eight years ago. The procedure went well. The surgical treatment was completed, and the wound fully recovered. He continued with internal medical treatment. Later, in mid-January, he caught a cold and developed a fever, which recurred. For the past two months, although the Chairman has been bedridden, he has been making decisions on state affairs, giving instructions, and responding to correspondence without rest, but the fever has not completely subsided. Doctors diagnosed him with compressive myelopathy, which requires surgical treatment by specialists. Furthermore, the Chairman has been devoted to national affairs for many years, working tirelessly, and has accumulated excessive fatigue. A change of scenery for recuperation can lead to an earlier recovery. Therefore, following medical advice, he went abroad on the 3rd of this month to seek medical treatment in Japan. On the 4th, he underwent surgery by a renowned doctor, and the procedure went extremely well. His health is improving day by day. During the Chairman's period of recuperation abroad, state affairs are being actively promoted as usual. The various duties are still being handled separately by President of the Executive Yuan, Chen Gongbo, and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Zhou Fo Hai. The Central Political Committee meeting and the Supreme National Defense Council are being presided over by Committee Member Chen Gongbo. The duties of the Chairman of the National Government are being handled by President of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Gongbo. The standing meeting of the Military Affairs Commission is being presided over by Standing Committee Member Chen Gongbo. The affairs of the Executive Yuan are being handled by Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Zhou Fo Hai. The affairs of the National Economic Commission are being handled by Vice Chairman Zhou Fo Hai.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Capture Tiddim, Achieved Great Results; Annihilated a Division of British-Indian Troops in Half a Month</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The enemy British-Indian 17th Division, with 10,000 men, was entrenched near Tonzang, attempting to counterattack Burma in the hilly area. However, since a certain military stronghold was captured, it has been completely annihilated. At the same time, after capturing the enemy's forward stronghold, the Japanese and Indian troops advanced north with unstoppable momentum, and continued to attack the enemy's stronghold 30 kilometers south of Tonzang. Another route of Japanese troops, after reaching an area about seven kilometers east of Tiddim, began shelling Tiddim. Another route of Japanese troops completely captured Tonzang, a key point north of Tiddim, on the 20th, and completely cut off the enemy's retreat. They are now annihilating the enemy attempting to escape, and are tightening their encirclement. On the 21st, the Japanese army once again used a night attack to break through the enemy's main stronghold and drove straight into Tiddim, completely capturing it. Currently, the Japanese army is urgently sweeping away the remaining enemies who have fled into the dense forest area. It is expected that the Japanese army will capture the enemy's automatic trucks, artillery, heavy and light machine guns, ammunition, etc., after capturing Tiddim, the stronghold of the enemy's 17th Division, and achieve great results. At the same time, since the Japanese army began encircling and annihilating the enemy on March 8, it has only taken 15 days to annihilate a large part of the enemy's division (a division of 10,000 men). This has made the morale of the Japanese-Indian Allied forces even more vigorous. Most tragically, the enemy vehicles were miserably defeated in the Sinzwea Basin and on the hills.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front of the Japanese army, this time the Japanese army took the initiative and launched an offensive operation on the Arakan front, which stretches for more than 1,000 kilometers from the south to Hrikikdafukung. The British-Indian 7th and 17th Divisions were completely destroyed. On the central India-Burma front, due to the urgent crisis at Imphal, the largest military stronghold in East India, the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma was completely shattered. Moreover, due to the offensive by the superior Japanese-Indian Allied forces on the Manipur Plain, the backs of the U.S.-Chinese Allied forces, with three divisions of the Chinese Expeditionary Force stationed in India at the northern Fukong front, were also threatened, and the opening of the transportation route has now been disappointed. The British and American airlift troops were only a frivolous move to win over the Chinese side. The airlift troops were also completely isolated on the battle route and became an easy target for the Japanese army. As a result, the Chinese side became more and more panicked. The United States is now strengthening the U.S. Air Force stationed in China and is increasing the number of U.S. troops stationed in India. It is carrying out major propaganda and has already begun to transport U.S. troops to India. Although the British and Americans are doing their best to appease the Chinese side, they have not yet succeeded. The powerful Chinese Expeditionary Force in Yunnan is still disregarding the crisis in India and remaining idle. Therefore, the relationship between China, Britain, and the United States is becoming more and more complex and delicate. This is also a problem that is causing more suffering for the anti-Axis camp.</p>
<h3>Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists Intensifies; Differing Opinions on the Constitutional Government Issue</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News: According to reliable sources, the Chongqing side resolved several important cases at the 11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held last year, including (1) convening a National Assembly to implement constitutional government one year after the end of the war; (2) resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue through political means. However, judging from these two issues, the Kuomintang and the Communists have differing opinions. The Communist Party advocates resolving the Kuomintang-Communist relationship through democratic means, and then strengthening unity to win the war and complete nation-building. Regarding the issue of constitutional government, the Communist Party does not even take into account the differences in the propositions, but the most important thing is whether the Chongqing side has sincerity. The Kuomintang has mentioned the issue of constitutional government twice. The first time was at the Sixth Plenary Session held in 1939, when responding to the proposal of the then Political Participation Council on implementing constitutional government on a regular basis, it was decided to convene a National Assembly on November 12, 1940, to formulate a constitution. However, the Kuomintang has not yet implemented it. The second time was at the 11th Plenary Session last year, when it was resolved to convene a National Assembly one year after the end of the war to implement constitutional government. Therefore, the Communist Party believes that "they have already implemented democracy, such as the Communist Party's border region government, and the 'anti-Japanese' base areas in central China and northern China, which have already implemented the so-called revolutionary Three People's Principles and democracy." Therefore, the Communist Party advocates that the implementation of constitutional government has three preconditions: (1) guaranteeing the people's democratic freedom, that is, the people's freedom of residence, assembly, association, speech, publication, etc.; (2) lifting the ban on political parties, requiring recognition of the legitimate status of all parties and factions in China, the so-called legitimate status means not treating other parties other than the Kuomintang as traitorous parties, and must not restrict or prohibit their activities within the scope of "anti-Japanese" democracy; (3) implementing local autonomy. Judging from the above, we can see that the Kuomintang and the Communists have differing opinions on the issue of constitutional government, and friction is becoming more and more intense. At the same time, other parties in Chongqing also have differing opinions on the issue of "implementing constitutional government." For example, Zuo Shunsheng, an important figure in the China Youth Party, and Yang Weiyu, who is close to the National Socialist Party, have both expressed their opinions. However, in order to avoid the Communist Party launching a political offensive, the Chongqing Kuomintang authorities emphasized various slogans such as democratic national defense and law-abiding in the Chongqing Central Daily and the Sweeping Newspaper at the end of December to resist the flames of democratic demands. (2) The Central Daily said that for the sake of democracy, personal liberalism must not be tolerated. (3) The Sweeping Newspaper warned that it will take a further step in understanding the members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association in their papers. (4) The editorial of the Central Society of Chongqing on February 23 openly opposed democracy. (5) If some newspapers in Chongqing carry new openings that demand the freedom of the people and freedom of speech, they are ordered to be removed after the printing plate is made. (6) The Xinhua Daily also openly stated that the constitutional movement in various places in late January was suppressed by the authorities, causing the constitutional issue to fall into a state of stagnation. And most people oppose secret arrests and abuse private disputes one year after the end of the constitutional government, and the convening of the National Assembly to implement the constitution, although welcomed by the general public, is worried about the political offensive of the Kuomintang, and has to use suppressive means. Therefore, the Chongqing side and the Communist Party have a lot of friction due to the constitutional government.</p>
<p>The Communist Party claimed that it had already been implemented, and proposed five conditions in return: (1) The Kuomintang should recognize the Communist Party's reasonable status in the country. (2) Recognize the border area and the anti-Japanese base areas as their local government. (3) Recognize the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and all rear troops as their subordinate troops under their jurisdiction. (4) Restore the serial number of the New Fourth Army. (5) Cancel the blockade and package of the anti-Japanese base areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. And it said that if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can meet each other sincerely and fairly on the basis of these basic conditions, they can solve all problems. We can predict the friction between the two sides if the Chongqing side will not agree to the above conditions.</p>
<h3>Vietnam's Exports to Japan All Agreed Upon; Both Parties Formally Signed the Agreement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities have continued negotiations in Saigon and Hanoi since the Saigon Rice Supply Agreement was signed on January 5th of this year regarding the terms to be implemented for the current year. Now, the final negotiations on all of Vietnam's exports have been conducted by Japanese Consul General to Vietnam, Oota, and Director of the Vietnamese Economic Bureau, Melton, and were officially signed at 11 a.m. on the 27th at the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam. At the same time, Japan and Vietnam issued a joint statement stating that the economic terms of the previous year were signed on August 19th, and the negotiation period for the current year has been shortened by five months. The negotiations proceeded very smoothly, demonstrating the close cooperation between Japan and Vietnam during the decisive battle period, which is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Java Strengthens Transportation; Builds Rubber Roads</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to strengthen transportation, Java is currently testing the construction of rubber roads and building oxcarts. The so-called rubber road is made by mixing rubber layers with tar and natural resin as a substitute for asphalt. Experiments are currently being conducted in the city of Jakarta. Once the experiments are successful and it is proven that they can withstand heat and are durable, they will be used to repair one square kilometer of roads on the island. As for oxcarts, they are for local transportation. Subsidies are allocated by the state halls and are being built in large numbers. It is planned to build 10,000 new oxcarts. In addition, the Bureau of Land Transportation has also prepared to manufacture 10,000 new oxcarts.</p>

<h3>The Provisional Government of Free India Held Important Meetings for Several Days; Broadly Discussing Various Issues in the Liberated Areas</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in Burma reports that after receiving the good news of the National Army breaking through the border, the Provisional Government of Free India convened an emergency meeting on the 20th to discuss various issues such as the administration of the liberated areas. It was decided to establish a new country within India, with the liberated areas as its territory, and to take the first step in glorious administration. On the 21st, Chairman Chandra Bose broadcast to India and the world, issuing a statement regarding the National Army's attack on India, calling on the people of the motherland to support the Japanese-Indian alliance, hinder the war capabilities of the British and American armies, and join the Indian National Army. He also elaborated on the purpose of the Provisional Government of Free India in taking over the administration of the liberated areas, thinking that this move will definitely have a great impact on the world and on all of India. Furthermore, prior to this, the Provisional Government of Free India had specially sent Secretary General Sahay and other government officials to the front line to investigate the liberated areas. After the border was broken through, it immediately ordered government officials waiting in a certain place to proceed quickly. They are currently starting various activities in the liberated areas. Furthermore, after convening an emergency cabinet meeting, the Provisional Government of Free India held important meetings for several days in a row, and broadly discussed economic and cultural aspects, and reached agreements on all of them. The most noteworthy of these is the policy towards the ethnic groups and castes (a clan based on traditional religious occupations in India) in the liberated areas. It was decided that all Indians, regardless of status, have equal obligations and equal rights, to overthrow the British separation system implemented for many years, and to foster the concept of India's Indians that exceeds race and class. As for the caste system, its shortcomings will be gradually corrected. Furthermore, the reason why the Provisional Government of Free India still uses the word "provisional" is because it wants to wait until the 400 million compatriots are completely liberated, and then establish a new Indian government based on the general will of all Indians.</p>
<h3>Millions of German Youths Pledge Allegiance to the Leader; Solemn Ceremony of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports: Germany, at that time, the leader of the German Youth League, Axmann, explained the significance of this ceremony to them. He said that the act of swearing allegiance to the leader was originally an expression of gratitude from German young men and women to their parents, especially German mothers, who deserve the gratitude and love of their children in this difficult time. The gratitude of German youth should not only be expressed in words, but also in their daily lives. Axmann solemnly declared, "Your model attitude towards your parents at home is a contribution to victory. Your teachings should also be included in your gratitude, because sincere friends and comrades are teaching you how to endure all the trials of the future." Exmann did not say that the leaders of the German youth also expect all young men and women to fulfill their responsibilities to the Hitler Youth.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Prime Minister Calls on All Citizens to Unite; Pro-German Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Soviet troops are frequently attacking in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and as a result, the situation in Southeastern Europe is gradually becoming more serious. The Bulgarian Parliament convened a conference from the 21st to the 25th to review important military and political national policies. At the close of the meeting, Prime Minister Bozhilov recited Regent Kirill's sentiments and gave a speech saying that the anti-Axis forces had destroyed most of our palace in order to frustrate the Bulgarian people's will to fight. The officials and people of our country deeply despise this method of warfare. At this moment, in order to seek the future happiness of our Bulgarian shareholders, we must have the determination to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens. The Bulgarian people should understand this major battle situation and remain calm in order to break through the difficulties.</p>
<p>Sofia, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Bulgaria's policy is to ally with Germany, so Bulgaria's attitude towards Germany is consistent. Bulgaria's policy towards its allied countries and friendly countries is also the same, and the parliament fully supports the foreign minister's proposals.</p>
<h3>War Spreads to the Border: Romania Prepares for Contingencies, Calls Up Reservists and Evacuates Residents</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 27th (Central News Agency): According to Dr. Henry Hee, special correspondent for the Huitong News Agency, as a result of the Soviet army's advance towards the Bug and Prut rivers, Romania is preparing materially and spiritually to cope with this crisis. Regarding material preparations, little is known due to military secrecy, but some information can be gleaned from the order issued yesterday in the newspaper by Army Chief General Pan Daiqi. According to the order, all reserve officers and non-commissioned officers, men aged 25 to 40 who have not served in the military or performed 45 days of labor service since June 22, 1941, must report to the nearest conscription bureau from April 1st to 15th. At the same time, the police station also issued an order stipulating the places to which residents of the capital should evacuate, mostly suburban villages. Those who can fill out application forms will be accommodated to avoid the danger of air raids. After the German announcement, the Romanian people learned that the war had broken out within Romanian territory, between Saroki and Poland. Romanian newspapers unanimously stated that if they could unite, they would be able to solve all kinds of difficulties, and at the same time urged the people to remain calm and disciplined.</p>
<h3>German Troops on the Eastern Front Adopt a Flexible Defensive Strategy, Withdraw from Two Important Southern Cities</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency): The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 26th: Fierce defensive battles have occurred on the German front from Pervomaisk to the east of Brody. During this battle, German troops have withdrawn from Balti and Polonskoye. According to Huitong News Agency, fierce battles have occurred between Polonskoye and Tarnopol. The Soviet command dispatched large numbers of light tanks and mechanized infantry, advancing south through the gap between the two cities in an attempt to shake the German positions between the Bug and Dniester rivers. The German command adopted a consistent flexible defensive tactic and Polonskoye's offensive failed. The current Soviet target is clearly the Seret River, which has military value in terms of transporting supplies. The fighting in the middle reaches of the Bug River is not as fierce as in previous days. The focus of the fighting has shifted to the north, and the Soviets continue to advance west. The Germans have already withdrawn from the city of Balti, located between the Dniester and Prut rivers. The Soviets failed again in attempting to cross the river in the lower reaches of the Bug River. On the central and northern sections of the Eastern Front, with the exception of the third battle for Vitebsk, there are only local battles elsewhere. The Soviet offensive in Vitebsk is not fierce, and the German army easily repelled it. German reconnaissance planes detected a large concentration of Soviet troops in the Kovel region and southeast of Brest-Litovsk, indicating that the Soviet army is preparing for a major offensive in the area.</p>
<h3>New Offensive Launched on the Cassino Front, British Eighth Army Reinforces</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported: German troops in the Cassino area dealt the enemy a major blow on the 24th, so General 京拉克 is currently reorganizing his forces. On the 25th, the enemy's offensive stalled. On the 26th, the American army, reinforced by the British Eighth Army, began a second major offensive.</p>
<h3>Geneva YMCA Building Accidentally Burns Down, 80,000 Books Destroyed</h3>
<p>Geneva, 27th (Central News Agency): The Geneva YMCA is in wartime chaos.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency received information from British sources: British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address last night, lasting 47 minutes, stating briefly that if the Allied Soviet Union failed to recognize the difficulties and complexities of crossing the sea and engaging in large-scale naval and land warfare. But I must warn you that in order to defeat the enemy, we must use various camouflage methods to confuse them. However, I cannot guarantee his words. A famous activity of a generation that has not shouldered heavy responsibilities said that we still need to work hard in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, the same as the Indian Ocean War.</p>
<h3>Over 170,000 Anti-Axis Wounded and Sick Soldiers Evacuated from Various Battlefields</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Army Department announced yesterday that in 1943, U.S. military aircraft evacuated 173,000 American and other anti-Axis wounded and sick soldiers from all over the world, demonstrating the severity of casualties suffered by anti-Axis forces on various battlefields. The number of wounded and sick soldiers evacuated from each major battlefield is as follows: New Guinea 70,080, Solomon Islands 23,767, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy 58,479.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Palestine</h3>
<p>Ankara, 27th (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency: The situation in Palestine is unstable. The authorities previously announced a state of emergency in several important towns, which has now been extended to other areas. Conflicts have occurred in cities of all sizes, but the news is strictly controlled. It is said that Jews in Haifa placed obstacles in front of the mayor's residence to prevent the police from entering the house to search.</p>
<h3>Unified Scientific and Technological Front</h3>
<p>The soldiers at the front are appealing: "Although we have the opportunity, we don't have aircraft." Or they say, "If the number of aircraft is doubled, we will definitely win." The rear should quickly increase aircraft production to defeat the Allied counteroffensive and turn the tide of the war. If we miss the opportunity, a winning war cannot be won. Therefore, we should pay attention to the urgent importance of the war situation. The enemy and we are fighting with aviation science on the front line. Modern warfare is a war of science, so we should accelerate the unification and strengthening of our scientific and technological front.</p>
<h3>Research on New Weapons</h3>
<p>To rapidly increase the production of excellent aircraft to defeat the enemy, the foundation is the unified general mobilization of science and technology and the production of research results. In other words, there is no other way except to improve production technology. Then, from the quality and quantity of these aircraft, there are still many shortcomings. First, the level of science and technology and its speed of advancement are not optimistic. Second, the production technology that is the foundation of productivity is mostly imported and imitated from foreign countries, and Japan's character has not yet been established. Third, there is no effective and appropriate mobilization for national purposes.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Research Mobilization Conference</h3>
<p>Needless to say, the government also ignores these shortcomings. In May of Showa 16 (i.e., the 30th year of the Republic of China), the cabinet decided on the establishment of a new scientific and technological system. According to this decision, the Technology Agency was established, or research institutions were assisted to guide production technology, handle foreign patents, enforce domestic patents, impart and disseminate excellent technologies, and promote administrative measures. Last August, the cabinet also decided on "Establishing a Comprehensive Strategy for Scientific and Technological Mobilization." According to this decision, a Research Mobilization Conference was established under the Prime Minister. The resolution stated: "With the rapid strengthening of aviation combat power as the center, seek thorough mobilization of science and technology, comprehensively unify the research systems of military, government, and civilian scientists and technologists, implement comprehensive capacity building, to maximize its total effect, and establish a strategy for rapidly transforming research results into combat power. Decide on national research topics: Appoint the most suitable person as a 'wartime researcher' to entrust research work." Thus, the Research Mobilization Conference is the highest and most unified central control mechanism for scientific and technological mobilization. Directly based on the requirements of the military, select research topics. Although people are urgently needed for research, this is the highest energy grab in the tight wartime situation. Originally, Japan's scientific and technological research camp included university and specialized school research institutions, independent research institutions, trial and research institutions affiliated with various provinces, and military research institutions, etc. There are also various academic associations that network scientists and technologists. These research institutions and academic associations are independent of each other. Not only is there no close contact, but even their supervisory authorities are divided into the Army, Navy, Military Affairs Ministry, and Ministry of Education. Therefore, there are the following shortcomings:</p>
<p>Limited researchers, materials, and equipment are repeatedly invested in the same research topic. Moreover, mutual research results are subject to extreme secrecy.</p>
<p>Various parties compete to entrust research to famous researchers, and although capable but unknown people are enthusiastic about research, they cannot accept urgent research topics.</p>
<p>The managers of research institutions, the heads of affiliated production companies, or research brokers act as intermediaries, creating misunderstanding and territorialism. The research of active young researchers on the front line does not fully promote enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, for the Cabinet's Research Mobilization Conference, established an Academic Research Conference, with a budget of over 18 million yuan, and plans to encourage research institutions and researchers related to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Research Mobilization System in the United States</h3>
<p>The enemy's research mobilization agency in the United States is the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC, chaired by Conant, President of Harvard University). There is also an administrative agency under the Emergency Management Office directly under the President, called the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD, directed by Carnegie, President of the Association) and the Office of Production Research and Development (OPRD). The OSRD has under it the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council (NRC, including the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (NRSP, directed by Carmichael), and the National Inventors Council (chaired by General Modest, Research Director Kettering)). When the research topics decided by the National Defense Research Conference are to be implemented and promoted, the Production Research Bureau strives to put them into production. The completed products are immediately transferred to the War Production Board (WPB, directed by Nelson) under the Emergency Management Office, which plans large-scale production. This smoothly unifies the mobilization of research. From this point of view, the enemy, the United States, is rapidly establishing a total-power research mobilization system, striving to mass-produce new weapons to supply the front lines. To overwhelm them, Japan should seize the opportunity to improve and strengthen the research mobilization system at this time. The specific strategies are as follows:</p>
<h3>Unification of Research Administration</h3>
<p>First, research administration should be thoroughly unified. To achieve this, the German universities, research institutes, and other official research institutions are guided and cultivated by the Aviation Ministry or the Research Council directly under the Air Force Marshal 　木林. The research institutions of the Army and Navy are placed separately because they are related to command, and the Research Mobilization Conference is used to coordinate official and civilian research. It is ideal to unify the Research Mobilization Conference and the Academic Research Conference. However, if this cannot be achieved, the Academic Research Conference should consult and discuss with the Research Mobilization Conference on the determination of research topics and the implementation of research to avoid duplication and make foolproof adjustments.</p>
<p>Second, the strengthened President of the Technology Agency should select talented people who can integrate technology, production, and politics to be ministers of state and attend cabinet meetings. The current Japanese politics can be described as cabinet-centric, so it is absolutely necessary to establish an organization that represents the scientific and technological community and can speak on important issues in the cabinet. However, regarding this point, there is another view that the Technology Agency should be an outer shell of the Military Affairs Ministry to directly link military demand production and technology to quickly utilize technology in production. However, even with this opinion, the President still needs to serve as a minister of state.</p>
<h3>Enactment of Research Management Law</h3>
<p>Third, a research management law should be enacted to thoroughly establish a national management system for the research of true science and technology and researchers. Regarding this point, some argue that the system of the Research Mobilization Conference and wartime researchers can be used to achieve results. Others say that this is not a way to fully exert the creativity of researchers. But if it does not develop to this point, how can the total power of the research team be fully mobilized?</p>
<p>Thus, the Research Mobilization Conference, the highest deliberative body, directly connects with operations through the military, selects research topics, and gradually mobilizes official and civilian researchers, fully investing materials and funds. If we promote the unified research of the Technology Agency, we can effectively combine the research intentions of scientists and technologists with the needs of the country and connect them with the front line, forming a solid decisive battle system. Under the current economic circumstances, it is no longer possible to expand production facilities and increase labor without limits, and waste raw materials. That is, we can no longer adopt the previous production methods. We should establish a unified total-power research and encouragement system adapted to the war situation, and in aircraft, radio weapons, or other weapons, achieve a degree that can completely defeat the enemy. By achieving a large increase in quality and quantity, we can thoroughly crush the enemy's general counteroffensive. To reiterate: Do not miss the opportunity, and strive to plan it urgently.

<h3>First Police Station Promotes Baojia Work, Holds Tea Party for All Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Baojia Section of the First Police Station of this city, in order to promote Baojia work and strive to meet the real and urgent needs of the people, specially hosted a grand tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3 pm yesterday (the 27th) for relevant authorities, celebrities from all sectors, and Baojia personnel of all levels above the Lianbao chief in this city. The Deputy Director, Du Zhengjian, and Wu Songfeng, Chief Secretary of the First District Office, Sun Lifu, Director of the General Affairs Department, Noguchi, Deputy Director, and Gojima, Director of the Special High Division of the Bureau, Yao Huiyi, Director of the Supervisory Division, Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Division, and the heads of each section, the heads of each branch bureau, the directors of each Baojia unit, each General Lianbao Chief, each Lianbao head, and celebrities from all walks of life, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Rangqin, etc., more than 600 people. Senior officials of the Baojia Section warmly received them, and the meeting started on time. First, everyone stood in silence, praying for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Du Zhengjian gave a speech, stating briefly: The Baojia system in Shanghai has been established for two years, and everyone has long understood its importance. I would like to take this opportunity to further elaborate on the important tasks of the Baojia. The Baojia system was implemented in ancient China and is of great importance to local public security. Especially in Shanghai, a large city, the organization of the Baojia system is even more important. Clearing up the population, checking on undesirable elements to establish public security, strengthening the organization of the self-defense corps, assisting the police in maintaining order, cooperating on air defense and fire protection, and clearing up the population can complete the Baojia system. Therefore, there must also be a sound Baojia organization in terms of the distribution of materials. At the same time, the Baojia should also work hard on various government policies and local health and epidemic prevention campaigns, as well as the campaigns to ban smoking, gambling, and dancing, the three poisons. In short, the Baojia system is a good system for the people to contact the police to maintain public security. I hope that in the future, the people will provide special cooperation and assistance to the Baojia and the police to make it sound.</p>
<h3>Director's Report</h3>
<p>Then, Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Section, gave a report, stating briefly: "I will give a simple report on the work of the past few months and the future work. Since taking over the concession on the first day of the month, we have unified the administrative power of the old two concessions and part of the areas beyond the boundary roads. In terms of Baojia, in the past, each was governed separately. The two districts were handled according to the regulations of the National Government. The old Public Concession and the French Concession each had their own systems. Since the establishment of the Baojia Section, they have been unified. Regarding the Baojia organization, temporary measures have been stipulated. The temporary measures for organizing the Baojia have adopted the advantages of the National Government regulations and the old two concession systems and have been compiled. Regarding the temporary measures for organizing the self-defense corps, in the past, each was governed separately. Now, in order to safeguard the obligations and rights that the people should fulfill and enjoy, temporary regulations have been decided. Penalties for the self-defense corps have also been decided. However, in the future, if various sectors have high opinions, it is hoped that they will be contributed at any time to facilitate amendments. Temporary measures for exempting the self-defense corps from service have also been formulated and announced. In addition, it has been decided to start replacing the residence permits next month. This residence permit is stipulated by the Ministry of the Interior. In the future, when traveling, it can eliminate the trouble of applying for travel permits. As for the replacement method, I hope that the citizens will pay close attention and thoroughly comply with the stipulated regulations. I hope that all sectors will cooperate more to promote the improvement of the Baojia system. Then, with the cooperation of the authorities and the people, social stability can be established."</p>
<h3>Guest Speech</h3>
<p>Then came the guest speeches. First, Yuan Lvdeng gave a speech, stating briefly: "I am a member of the beginning of the Baojia organization. Today, I am very happy to meet you all and gather together to discuss the promotion of the Baojia system. The Baojia is a good system to assist the police in effectively maintaining public security in Shanghai. I hope that the citizens will work hard to cooperate with the authorities and work hard to comply with the regulations and procedures to make the Baojia work progress gradually." Then Li Sihao gave a speech: "The citizens should strictly abide by the Baojia rules and regulations. Those who are dissatisfied should request amendments. The people should understand the purpose of the government's legislation and cooperate to the end so that public security in Shanghai can be guaranteed." Finally, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Deqin, Wang Boyuan, and others gave speeches in succession, and Wang Lianfang, representative of the General Lianbao Chiefs, and others gave speeches in succession. After the speeches, tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Tram Company Abolishes the Ticket Collection System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tram Company, in order to prevent fraud, has formulated two measures: abolishing the ticket collection system and thoroughly and strictly checking tickets, which will be implemented from the 31st of this month. At the same time, it is hoped that all passengers will cooperate and abide by them. The details are: 1. Strictly prohibit the ticket collection system. Passengers must never hand over their tickets to the ticket seller or other staff when getting off the bus. 2. Thoroughly and strictly check tickets. Passengers need to keep their tickets on the bus. If they have paid the fare but do not take the ticket, they still need to purchase a ticket as usual.</p>
<h3>Conservancy Preparation Office Holds a Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Rugeng, Director of the Conservancy Preparation Office, in order to inspect the conditions along the canal and understand the opinions of local Chinese and Japanese parties on the management of the canal, personally led his staff to inspect Yangzhou, Shiying, Huaiyin, Gaoyou, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Canal Station, Lianyungang, Bengbu, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places starting last month. The inspection has been completed recently. From Hangzhou to Shanghai, Mr. Gu, in order to understand the opinions of all parties in the city on the management of the canal, specially invited Chinese and Japanese people and hydraulic experts from the city to hold a discussion meeting at 3 pm yesterday (the 27th) on the ninth floor of the Hua Hotel. The Chinese and Japanese parties present included Wen Lanshi, Chairman of the Cotton Unity Association, Li Kaichen (Yao Dingdai), Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, Ueda Kenjiro, Di 　, Mochizuki Kisaburo, representatives of the Rice Unity Association, Shen Dianchun, representative of the Commerce Unity Association, Xu Shaoxiu, representative of the Municipal Government, Ye Wangchen and Yi 　, representatives of the Civil Ship Association, Tejima, Major of the Naval Attaché's Office, Imoto, Captain, Tanaka, Lieutenant of the General Army Headquarters, Kanematsu, Lieutenant of the Army Department, and 籘本, Lieutenant of the Corps, Hachu Wei Nengguan of the Embassy, ​​Ichikawa entrusted, etc., dozens of people.

<h3>Expect the Forthcoming Distribution of Household Coal Briquettes</h3>
<p>Residents have already used up the third batch of household coal briquettes, and the date for the supply of the fourth batch has not yet been determined, and it is hoped that it will start as soon as possible. It is reported that the amount of coal briquettes used has decreased by more than one-third compared with the past. If the coal layer stored in Shanghai (the raw material used to manufacture coal briquettes) is exclusively used for manufacturing household coal briquettes, it is enough for more than three months. It is expected that in the near future, a large amount of coal dust will be transported to this place.</p>
<h3>South City Patrol Units to Wear Distinctive Armbands</h3>
<p>To suppress theft in the South City district under the citywide blackout, the Second Police Bureau has implemented a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan and organized patrol units. Detectives dispatched from the Criminal Investigation Brigade will join armed police officers in these patrols. In addition to police officers wearing uniforms, detectives will wear distinctive armbands for identification. Individuals without police accompaniment and not wearing an armband are impersonating officers, and residents in the area may refuse to be questioned to prevent unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>News Correspondent Wanted</h3>
<p>To enrich news content, this publication is soliciting news articles from across the country and this city. Submissions should be factual, concise, and to the point. Once used, special remuneration will be offered. Candidates with superior performance will be hired as special correspondents. Please send submissions to the editorial office of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Luggage for Passengers on the Central China Railway</h3>
<p>To reduce the number of passengers, alleviate congestion, and maintain order on its trains, the Central China Railway will strictly limit the luggage and goods that passengers can bring on board, effective April 1st, for all stations along the line. Restrictions were initially implemented on January 10th, limiting passengers to two pieces of luggage each. Now, the policy has been revised to allow Chinese and Japanese passengers to carry only one piece of luggage, equivalent in size to a medium-sized suitcase or kerosene can, and weighing no more than 15 kilograms. Third-class passengers are prohibited from using "red caps" (porters) to carry their luggage. Stations with multiple ticket barriers should separate passengers with and without luggage, allowing those without luggage to board first. Passengers carrying two pieces of luggage or smuggling goods will be strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Baojia System</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the First Police Bureau's Baojia Office hosted leaders from various sectors and senior Baojia personnel to report on the Baojia system and solicit opinions on promoting its work. Attendance was enthusiastic, demonstrating the interest of all sectors in Baojia affairs.</p>
<p>The Baojia system originated early in our country and has been implemented in many places. Historical experience indicates that it is more effective in rural areas. Shanghai, a metropolis with a large and diverse population, was initially considered difficult for implementing the Baojia system effectively. However, the experience of the past two years has refuted this notion. The Baojia system has assisted in many public security maintenance tasks and cooperated with many police duties. Most notably, it has reduced the number of terrorist incidents. This is a testament to the cooperation between local police and civilians in the past two years, a valuable achievement.</p>
<p>However, as the Greater East Asia War approaches its decisive stage, Shanghai, as an important rear base, will face increasing enemy sabotage and espionage activities. Therefore, the responsibility of maintaining Shanghai's public security is becoming more arduous. We expect to strengthen the service spirit of the police and equally need to strengthen the service spirit of the Baojia system, cooperating with the police and assisting the military and police to maintain public security.</p>
<p>The most practical way to assist in maintaining public security is through the self-defense corps members. They should watch out for each other while on duty and actively prevent and report any suspicious activity when off duty to prevent criminals from lurking.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Second Optimistic Factor</h3>
<p>At the tea party hosted by the four major organizations in this city last week to welcome Minister Tajiri, Minister Tajiri mentioned three optimistic factors. Regarding economic factors, he stated: "In wartime, a completely free economy is impossible. In wartime, it is unacceptable to lack a wartime mentality. Now, both Chinese and Japanese people are gradually understanding this meaning, which is the second optimistic factor."</p>
<p>This "second optimistic factor" (the first is that there is a trend towards integrity in Chinese politics and the third is that Chinese and Japanese understanding of Japan's new policies towards China is gradually converging) is not based on any excellent achievements already made in the wartime economy, but rather on the gradual understanding of the meaning of the wartime economy by people in the economic sector.</p>
<p>To enrich this optimistic belief, we can talk about the Chinese Industrial Association recently organized by leaders in Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors. The members of the Industrial Association are mostly responsible individuals in production enterprises. In that case, what they should contribute to the wartime mentality in the economy is, from an active perspective, to strengthen the industrial structure and increase the speed of production, using the rising smoke from factories to symbolize the spirit of active wartime production. From a passive perspective, it is to do their best to avoid all styles of profiting through illegal means, eliminate the mentality of enjoying immediate benefits, and broaden their vision, demonstrating a wartime spirit of sacrificing the individual for the greater good. The combination of these two wartime mentalities can plant the seeds of revitalization and prosperity for Shanghai, the economic center of the country. Therefore, what we hope from the Chinese Industrial Association from now on can be taken as an explanation of this "second optimistic factor."</p>
<h3>Eleven Banks to Handle Exchange between Central China and North China; Black Market for Joint Currency Prohibited from Today</h3>
<p>Due to recent speculation in this city, a black market for joint currency has emerged, with the exchange rate differing significantly from the official rate. To promote the exchange of goods and funds between Central China and North China and facilitate legitimate transactions, the Central Reserve Bank has prohibited all financial institutions from engaging in the buying and selling of Central Reserve Certificates and joint currency, starting yesterday (the 27th). In addition to temporarily setting the maximum amount of currency that travelers can exchange and remit to North China at 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates, the bank has designated nine Chinese commercial banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Dah Mou Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Chung Nan Bank, and Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, as well as the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank and Bank of Chosen, to handle remittances to North China.</p>
<p>It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank held a discussion meeting with the persons in charge of each bank at its Shanghai branch at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Qian Da, Vice President of the Bank, explained the significance and exchanged opinions. It was decided to determine the procedures for handling the north-south remittance and collect the remittance fee. For each 100 Central Reserve Certificates, a remittance fee of one yuan will be temporarily charged. If each bank needs joint currency to settle positions, the Central Bank will supply it in appropriate quantity. It is hoped that each bank will be careful in handling the remittance of joint currency and avoid being exploited by speculators. Following is a record of Vice President Qian's conversation:</p>
<h3>Qian's Remarks</h3>
<p>Adhering to the exchange rate of 100 Central Reserve Certificates to 18 yuan for joint currency is a necessary measure for the sound development of China's economy, which need not be elaborated upon. The exchange of goods and funds between Central China and North China should adhere to this rate to ensure smooth operation. The Central Reserve Bank and the United Reserve Bank have repeatedly sought appropriate arrangements for this matter, which should be well known to the public.</p>
<p>Recently, illegal speculation has led to the emergence of a black market for joint currency, with a significant difference between the black market rate and the official exchange rate. The authorities deeply regret this and feel the need to take severe measures. It has been decided to purchase all joint currency held by financial institutions at the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan and prohibit all financial institutions from engaging in the buying and selling of Central Reserve Certificates and joint currency in the future. However, the authorities will provide as much convenience as possible for normal transactions to facilitate the integrated development of the economies of Central China and North China. Therefore, the limit on the amount of currency that travelers can exchange and the limit on remittances between the two regions will be relaxed to a corresponding degree. We are currently consulting with the authorities in North China to determine the methods, collect a small handling fee at the official rate, and allow free remittances within the possible scope. This will be realized soon.</p>
<p>It is temporarily stipulated that the maximum amount of currency that travelers can exchange and the maximum amount of remittances to North China are 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates. The following eleven banks are designated to handle remittances to North China: Chung Nan Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Dah Mou Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Bank of Chosen. If the above banks request this bank to settle at the official rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan, this bank will comply. After the implementation of these measures, illegal transactions will be eradicated, while legitimate transactions will be greatly facilitated. Under the principle of adhering to the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan, the exchange of goods and funds between the two regions will be a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Should Supervise Members' Transactions</h3>
<p>The two responsible authorities of Shanghai Economic and Food, in order to follow the order of the municipal government and approve the notification from the Ministry of Industry that each trade association should supervise members to prevent illegal trading, specially instructed each trade association to be notified, briefly stating: "Each trade association should strictly warn its members and should not be lenient. If any member is found to be engaged in illegal trading, their membership should be immediately revoked and reported to the competent authority for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law to maintain discipline. If they dare to conceal and fail to report, once the competent authority finds out, the persons in charge of the trade association should also be punished accordingly to serve as a warning."</p>

<h3>Clearing is No Longer in Existence</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhai</p>
<p>The term "clearing" originally referred to checks that were cashed the following day. After 1937, following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in 1941, commercial banks and native banks in Shanghai, in order to cope with the emergency and maintain the market, successively imposed restrictions that "clearing is limited to interbank transfers and cannot be cashed." By June 1942, Central Reserve Certificates had become the only currency in this city, and the issuance and contraction of currency depended entirely on the Central Reserve Bank's proper regulation. This temporary boundary between cash and clearing was long gone. By June 1943, the affairs of transferring the exchange difference of the Bank Notes Clearing House were transferred to the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank was responsible for the exchange of notes between domestic commercial banks and foreign banks. From this time onwards, the clearing system had long ceased to exist. Anyone who received clearing notes could obtain cash. (Parallel line checks must first be entrusted to a bank or native bank for collection before they can be cashed. This is stipulated by the Negotiable Instruments Law. Cash notes and clearing notes are all like this.) Therefore, although the notes issued by banks and native banks still have the word "clearing" on them, they are actually no different from cash notes.</p>
<p>Recently, many news reports and commentaries in newspapers have mentioned clearing, believing that clearing still exists today, which is very different from the facts. Only the section "There is no clearing currency now" in the economic commentary of the News Daily on March 22nd is sufficient to correct the general misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Examining the reason for this misunderstanding, it should be because bank and native bank notes and transfer slips still have the words "clearing" or "clearing head." However, these two words only have historical significance, as mentioned above. The exchange notes and collection figures published monthly by the Bank Clearing House still distinguish between "cash" and "clearing head." In reality, as far as this author knows, when the Bank Clearing House transferred the exchange difference transfer affairs to the Central Reserve Bank last June, because there was no difference between "clearing" and "cash" after that, the original separate handling of clearing and cash was changed to joint handling for all receipt and payment accounts and exchange procedures. Later, because the term clearing had a long history and custom in this city, it was not explicitly abolished for fear of stimulating the market and causing doubts, so it was formally maintained. The reports about the disposal of large clearing amounts are misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>District Office Staff Should Be Treated the Same as Police Officers</h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>Suppressing prices is certainly the key to thoroughly solving the problem of livelihood, but increasing salaries is also a stopgap measure to alleviate the hardship of life. If prices are allowed to rise while salaries are not increased, this contradictory phenomenon will only encourage corruption. This is true for a store, and it is also true for a government organization. Therefore, increasing salaries is an important measure that cannot be ignored at present, because only with a stable life can people serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>The salaries of the staff of the First District Office and the First Police Bureau have already been increased several times. The Third Police Bureau has also adjusted its salaries since its merger. Although the salaries are still far from keeping up with the current cost of living, it can be said that the authorities have fulfilled part of their responsibility in adjusting the salaries of the police officers.</p>
<p>As for the staff of the former Eighth District Office, they have not received a salary increase for several months. The income of the staff ranges from over 1,000 yuan to as little as 600 or 700 yuan. In such an expensive life, this meager income is not enough to maintain a personal life. However, the staff all have families. How can they support their families? Now that the two districts have been merged since the beginning of last month, there is no longer any distinction between them, but the salaries have not yet been adjusted. What is the intention? It is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The police have the important responsibility of maintaining public security, but the staff of the District Office also have the same mission. They should not be treated differently, but should be adjusted equally. In addition, organizations such as consumer cooperatives for police officers should also be widely promoted so that the staff of the District Office can share the benefits, which is a reasonable measure. It is hoped that all sectors will show sympathy and support.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers Respond to the Poor Women's Maternity Fund Movement; Eagerly Awaiting Generous Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Currently, prices are high, and the daily lives of ordinary people in the low-income class have been reduced to the minimum, yet it is still difficult to maintain. Unfortunately, poor wives give birth, and their rooms are small and doctors are expensive. They always feel worried and tearful, and have no way to make ends meet. Yesterday, I received a letter from the Poor Assistance Office, saying:</p>
<p>"The local office has a maternity fund for elementary school teachers. I am also one of the beneficiaries. My wife and children are still healthy and lively today, and I am very grateful. I recently heard that the local office will implement maternity assistance on a wide scale, providing relief to poor pregnant women, so that they can receive hygienic and medical childbirth. I am delighted to hear this, and I am sorry that I lack the strength to donate. I am writing a few lines to respond and at the same time hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously to the maternity fund." Signed, A Grateful Poor Teacher</p>
<h3>Collection Report</h3>
<p>Small Teacher Medical Assistance Fund: Undistributed clothing surplus (including 40,000 yuan allocated to the maternity fund) 50,000 yuan, balance 100,394.4 yuan. Poverty Relief Fund: Undistributed winter clothing surplus (including 10,000 yuan allocated to the elderly assistance fund and 2,000 yuan to street children's maternity assistance) 22,000 yuan, balance 136,269.7 yuan. Small Business Loan Fund: Undistributed winter clothing surplus 10,000 yuan, Deng Boxi 200 yuan, total collected 10,200 yuan, balance 29,415 yuan.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Hong Yang, translated</p>
<p>Sky and Sea (3)</p>
<p>During the commissioning period, we often patrolled the seas near Japan, but this time it was a different story. Navigating through the many islands of the Seto Inland Sea may have been more difficult in terms of navigation, but it was not the sea we were familiar with, and the feeling of abandoning ship was very different. People were enjoying the sake, and it was hard to say that those on board were just trainees, but they were already high-ranking officers who had been appointed. Although it was a training squadron, it was not just about training. If an unidentified aircraft were to attack, we would immediately begin combat deployment and respond. Moreover, the warship we were on was the flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, with a glorious battle history in the naval battles of Ulsan and the Sea of Japan. Although old, perhaps due to its history, it had a special character and flavor.</p>
<p>This warship, with its energetic cadets, was like new wine in an old skin, and the ship's appearance was changing. Therefore, the officers felt a sense of honor and responsibility.</p>
<p>On the first day of sailing, the chief instructor introduced the officers' mess and the sub-officers' mess. The chief instructor, Major Ri, was a short, round-faced, energetic man. The cadets on board the warships received his guidance during their approximately six-month voyage. Naval officers never forget the instructors who guide them at sea. Even if the former cadets are promoted to higher ranks after the instructor becomes a reservist, they avoid taking the upper seat. After all, the instructor is respected as a teacher and father, and the officers in the officers' mess, especially the sub-officers in the sub-officers' mess, act like older brothers, setting an example in their words and deeds. The officers' position is quite restrictive, but there may be officers who break the rules and provide cheerful and straightforward counter-therapy.</p>
<p>The men felt as if they had returned to their fourth-year student days, but the reality was very different. There were things that they did not have in their fourth-year days, namely subordinates, non-commissioned officers and sailors. Moreover, these subordinates were elite soldiers selected from the naval brigade. The instructors and officers were all carefully selected, and the non-commissioned officers and sailors were also carefully considered by these cadets who had subordinates for the first time. It was planned to give the men good "superiors" and good (subordinates) on their first journey.</p>
<p>From the second day onwards, they began to implement placement education, combat training, and no-lights navigation training.</p>
<p>On the third day, we had the first port call at Maizuru. Those who wanted to land were allowed to stay on board. The men stayed on board and wrote formal graduation communications under the lights of the cadet room. They wrote to the principal of Kawade No. 2 Middle School, Mr. Ogata, and other former teachers and friends. Only news of Mutaguchi was still unclear and unable to communicate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital Adds Free Beds</h3>
<p>Cheng Guoshu, director of the East Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital on Avenue Road, wrote: "In view of the difficult living conditions of the people and the rising prices of medical care, in order to respond to the Jizhi Yunquan campaign, we have specially set up two free beds, hoping that your newspaper will recommend them. We will serve them sincerely."</p>
<p>Selling Field Proceeds to Help Good Deeds: He Ren from Ren Shou Tang came yesterday and said, "My owner is deeply concerned about the current difficulties and wants to do his best. He will sell more than 200 acres of ancestral Zhenjiang Shizhou Taipingwei thermal field at a price of 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates per acre, and donate 250,000 yuan, accounting for 25% of the proceeds, to charity. It is agreed that after the sale, 100,000 yuan each will be sent to the Shen Bao Charity Fund and the Xinkai Newspaper Loan Scholarship, 30,000 yuan to Xinpu Charity Hall, and 20,000 yuan to the Epidemic Hospital. The field produces two harvests of wheat and rice each year, and the embankments are complete. It is hoped that investors will not only secure their investment but also reap good results. All buying and selling procedures have been entrusted to Jianzhong Real Estate Joint Stock Company (telephone 26228) at No. 19, 3rd floor, Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will join in this good deed. He Ren Qi."</p>
<h3>A Tour of the New Universal Fosterage Hall</h3>
<p>— Chang Xin</p>
<p>The flowing time slips away day by day, but at the same time, the cost of living follows the time, soaring like a flying bird. The difference in time is not far, only about two months! The prices of daily necessities and food have risen by more than 100%. Maintaining a livelihood is really not easy, let alone a large-scale, heavily populated charity organization - the New Universal Fosterage Hall. Of course, it feels that the funds budgeted for two months ago (with the help of the New Newspaper's fundraising) now have the predicament of not being able to maintain them. In order to maintain the lives of these helpless and suffering people, fundraising must be held again. Mr. Lu, the person in charge of the hall, has come several times to request the newspaper's assistance in continuing to raise two million yuan, which is expected to last until the end of the year. For the sake of these lonely and helpless elderly and children, this newspaper earnestly hopes that kind benefactors from all walks of life will generously donate and make great merits.</p>
<p>Today, the reporter braved the rain to the New Universal Fosterage Hall. Before even stepping inside, the first thing that caught our eye was the neat and brightly colored maternity ward, with Western-style gardens and vegetable patches, as well as gardens with a foreign flavor..., beautifully decorated. Guided by the hall's Chinese and Western "Mumu" (nuns), we toured the various sections and were given detailed explanations by President Lu.</p>
<h3>Internal Organizational Situation</h3>
<p>The New Universal Fosterage Hall is built on a square of more than ten mu on Guohuo Road in the Southern City, with more than a thousand buildings. It has a history of thirty-three years and was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong. It is dedicated to taking in the poor, elderly, young, disabled, lonely, and helpless people, which can be roughly divided into sections for infant care, kindergarten, orphans, the disabled, elderly care, the sick and poor, and outpatient services. (Detailed facilities are described later.) The number of poor people who have been taken in has exceeded 110,000. The number of outpatient medical treatments and medication dispensed has reached more than 2.4 million. At present, there are about 900 men, women, old, and young people being accommodated in the hall.</p>
<p>Regarding the various sections of the hall, the seventeen "Mumu" of the Sisters of Charity of the Catholic Church, and some male and female workers (these workers are the disabled and elderly in the hall) are actually working hard and managing diligently. In this hall, from the director to the nuns to the workers, all fulfill their obligations and do not receive any salary. Most of the nuns are of European, American, or Chinese nationality. They have all received high-level education. Under the guidance of the Catholic teachings, they abandon their noble pursuits and all wear cloth clothes and white hats. They are truly simple, clean, and compassionate in serving those who are suffering. Therefore, the place is filled with the radiance of universal love.</p>
