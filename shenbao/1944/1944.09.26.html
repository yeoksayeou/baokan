<h3>清議與輿論</h3>
<p>昨天中國新聞協會在本市舉行成立大會，推選李贊侯先生擔任會長，並承宣傳部林部長以及盟邦日本陸海軍及大使館報道部長出席指導，全國各地報社均有代表參加，情況熱烈。我們在昨天已就會員一份子的本位，略作獻詞。　　昨天李會長在成立大會致詞中，提出三自點期期人，其中第二點，提到[加強輿論，造成清議]。在此全國性的新聞協會成立伊始，集合全體報界負責代表，要求團結一致，發揮宣傳最高效率，達成宣傳最大任務之際，加強輿論，造成清議，確爲最前提的必要工作。　　清議就是輿論，在沒有報紙以前，士大夫階級，公正士紳階級，對於政治現狀的批評，對於人民要求的建議，發出議論，彼此想應，逐漸形成一種清議。政府對於清議很爲重視，社會對於清議，很爲尊重。於是，這種清議就發生力量。當然，這種清議是必須基於大衆利益的要求，必須基於理智的決定的。　　自從有了報紙以後，以前的清議，可以隨時在報紙上發表，藉報紙的力量，很迅速的傳播於大衆，彼此相應，逐漸形成一種輿論趨勢，政府對於輿論應該重視，社會對於輿論應該尊重，於是，這種輿論就發生力量。當然，這種輿論是也必須基於大衆利益的要求的，也必須基於理智的決定的。　　社會上有清議，有輿論，同時，政府重視清議，重視輿論；社會尊重清議，尊重輿論。那末，政治必上軌道，社會秩序也必上軌道。如果社會上雖有清議，雖有輿論，而政府並不重視清議，並不重視輿論；社會並不尊重清議，並不尊重輿論，那末，政治必不上軌道，社會秩序也必不上軌道。爲什麼呢？因爲政府如不重視清議，重視輿論；社會如不尊理清議，如不尊重輿論，則返過來說，就是只憑少數人的主觀，只聽從少數人的意見。而這少數人的主觀與意見，必定是基於少數人的利益，必定是基於少數人的情感決定的。譬如政府中有少數人貪污，或社會上有少數人囤積投機，這種行爲就是基於少數人利益，完全由於個人的利慾出發的。他們並不尊重清議與輿，就不怕清議與輿淪。於是以做了違法行爲並不受制裁，引爲榮耀，誇張有辦法，有神通。這種現象，更足反映清議與輿論的無力。　　最後，鋮望人家重視與尊重，必先自己重視與尊重。同時，必須自己有重視與尊重之道，然後才能獲得人家的重視與尊重。所以，我們新聞界也應深自檢點，嚴厲自肅。新聞界同人，尤其是居於領導地位的同人，應有威武不屈，富貴不淫，貧賤不移的精神，爲大衆利益着想，全憑理智，造成清議，造成輿論，以期引起政府重視，引起社會尊重。</p>

<h3>會長致辭</h3>
<p>會長李思浩致開會辭云：諸位先生，今天中國新聞協會成立，承蒙推舉史弟担任會長，很爲慚愧，因爲兄弟自問學識荒蕪，且與新聞界很少關係，誠恐有負朝野的期望，不過，旣然接受了付託之重，同時感於時局的嚴重性，新聞界站在時代先驅的地位，自應充分發揮固有的效能，今天願以三事自期並以期人。第一應特別注重民間疾苦，一般人稱譽報紙[爲民喉舌]，就是代表人民談話，中國是[民國]，中國政府是[國民政府]，還有人說[官吏爲人民的公僕]，所以無論在客觀上主觀上，對於人民利益，首須重視，尤其是民間疾苦，特別指出，不厭求詳，促起關係方面共同注意改善。第二加強輿論，造成清議，輿論的本身，也應該不斷求進步，以人民利益爲主觀，以政府環境爲客觀，造成清議之風，人民翕服，政府重視。第三上面兩點是新聞界本身應該把握的，同時，希望政府方面與盟邦方面，特別注意尊重輿論，不但不加以妨礙，並且要維持新聞界的尊嚴，我相信新聞界能夠把握目標，不斷求進，同時獲得當局方面尊重輿論的保障，那末新聞事業的使命，才能負丐，中國新聞協會就循照這一個途經邁進。</p>
<h3>市長祝詞</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會於決戰階段之今日，在滬舉行成立大會，集合全國新聞界及旅華盟邦報人力量，以担負決戰下思想戰之重要任務，意義至爲重大。貴會在我國新聞史上乃爲一空前之大組織，在中日兩國新聞界提携團結上，亦爲一偉大之新貢獻。深信貴會成立之後，各會員報社將在統一領導之下，以同一目標，同一信念，及同一步驟，發揮整個新聞界之力量，完成文化戰及思想戰之使命。我國新聞界過去深染自由主義色彩，形成各自爲政之局面，今茲貴會成立，定可掃除此一弱點·邁進集團發展之大道，並可使政府與輿論機關之聯繫，更爲密切，不致發生任何隔膜，而眞正之民意，亦得自由暢達，配合政府尊重言論之旨，協力政治之改進，決戰體制之完備，進而爭取大東亞戰爭勝利之獲得，及新中國復興建設之完成。貴會此次在滬舉行成立大會，本人忝爲上海市長，殊感榮幸，謹以滿腔熱誠，恭祝貴會會務蒸蒸日上，我國新聞事業無限發展。</p>
<h3>管局長詞</h3>
<p>華北政備委員會政務廳管情報局長代表祝詞如下：今天是中國新聞協會成立的良辰，鄙人代表華北新報遠道趕來，參加盛典，並代表管翼賢社長說幾句話。我所說的話分爲三部分，第一部分，可以說是對協會的祝賀之忱，第二部分，報告華北新聞體制的槪況，第三部份，則是華北新聞界對於協會的期待。全國新聞協會的成立，在我國尚屬創舉，這不僅爲應付決戰體制的要求，且象徵我國新聞事業的發展。今後的我國新聞界在協會的提掖輔導之下，得以集中全力，從事於自己的職責，新聞事業的對國家的使命，必能早日完成，這是堪爲吾人祝賀者之一。在戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要，會規定有中國文化總會的成立，以整備全國文化宣傳體制，文化總會乃是由出版新聞著述等等協會統一的組織，現在中國新聞協會的成立，正是文化總會成立的先聲，行將見我國的文化事業，担負起時代的任務，向前推進，這是堪爲吾人祝賀者之二。新聞社是表達民意的機關，是領導正當輿論的所在，全國新聞社的統一，不啻是會國輿論的一致，而給於吾人以整個國家統一的預感，吾人相信協會成立之後，此種吉祥朕兆，不難成爲事實，此吾人所堪致賀者之三。最後並報告華北新聞事業狀況綦詳（從略）。</p>

<h3>松島部長祝詞</h3>
<p>本日於林宣傳部長閣下出席之下，新聞協會之成立儀式如此盛大舉行者，爲指導機關之一之海軍，實同深慶賀。追溯本協會自設立計劃問世以來，業經年餘，其間在各有關者之一同熱心研究與協力之下，得能圓滿進展此次乃成立，在有形無形上，均爲將來文化宣傳工作上極重大之統一的統制機關，今後對於大東亞之建設，有極大之貢獻者，深信無疑，尤其將華北華南包括於其大有作爲之機關中，產生全華打成一片之偉大文化陣營者，實可謂爲空前未有之盛舉。吾人於是更痛感本協會使命之重大，謹希望指導者方面及協會方面，均立於大局之立塲，進行密切之協力，向完成其高遠月的之前途邁進，謹以此爲慶祝之辭</p>

<h3>嚴格管理物價厲行標簽制度</h3>
<p>經濁保安處五鳴處長談話　　關於管理物價，經濟保安處五鳴處長，發表談話如下：　　於非常時局下施行經濟統制，實爲增強國力上不可缺之政策，就中尤以管理物價一節，對於安定民生上，至爲緊要，勿庸贅述者也。　　惟對於上海市內各商店所販賢之商品，在民國三十一年六月三十日，萬工部局以第五九八四號告示，制定標價簽販賣制度，旋於仝三十三年一月十三日，國民政府又公布物價管理暫行條例，次由實業部規定實施辦法，普遍全國組織物價管理委員會，同時並由經濟主管官署嚴令，凡爲販賣商品一律應付物價標簽，諒一般商人，均已熟悉焉。　　然近來市內各商店中，仍有不顧法紀，陽奉陰違，乘物價將趨飛騰，從中獲取不正利潤之奸商，爲數不少，對於安定民生上，甚爲遺憾。有鑑於斯，此次由實業部嚴令強度實施管理政策，奉此市經濟局及本經濟保安處，爲促醒不法商人，強調協力當局之施策計，於九月十七日，會闡明市經濟局之方針，務使各商店又省，除公布價格，應付用物價標簽外，其他未規定者，亦有付用之必要，本經濟保安處最近將調查物價標簽制實施狀況，以期撤底施行管理物價政策，仰各商店負責者，體解當局本意，勿有違犯行爲，嚴格遵守規定爲盼。</p>

<h3>華北資金流滬七月份達四萬萬元</h3>
<p>自中央儲備銀行與華北中國聯合準備銀行實行通滙以來，華中與華北間資金交流日臻圓滑，南北間之物資互相營運更見發展，由滬滙往華北及華北滙來上海之資金川流不息，悉爲商人經營貿易之用途，足見南北物資交流促進匪鮮。經近兩月以來，華北資金之流入上海者頗多。一般投機商人乘機煽惑人心，從中撈獲非法盈利，事經有關當局鄭重聲明後，無稽流言遂悉予平戢。據中央社記者頃向金融機關構威方面探悉，華北資金流入上海數字，確較上海滙往華北者爲多，如本年七月份華北匯來上海款項，據統計達新法幣四萬二千三百餘萬元，而上海滙往華北者則僅聯鈔二千三百餘萬元，（約合法幣一萬三千二百餘萬元），但此項南北滙兌之數字，實行南北物資貿易必需之資金。</p>

<h3>發揮偉大精神加強決戰力量</h3>
<p>因爲這是決戰的階段，因爲大東亞戰爭是民族共存主義對國際侵略主義的戰爭，在敵人一方面是掠奪性的戰爭，是摧殘文化毀滅人道的戰爭，在我們一方面是正義感的戰爭，是發揚道義精神，保衛人類福址的戰爭，惟其如此，軍事的力量，是決戰的主要條件，精神的力量，也是決戰的主要條件。當此前方將士浴血犧牲，爭取決戰勝利的時候，我們就算未能投筆從戎，而我們的責任，和前方將士的責任，沒有兩樣。我們必須發揮偉大的精神力量，以此增進決戰所必需的物質力量，並以此加強決戰所運用的軍事力量。凡是在後方的民衆，都有這個責任，而負責輿論領導民衆的新聞界，尤其應該負起這個責任。就復興中華來說，中國新聞界應該担負這個責任。就保衛東亞來說，中日兩國新聞界，更應該精誠團結共同担負起這個責任。這是中國新聞協會的第一個使命。</p>

<p>中國新聞事業，歷史很早，也不能說沒有相當的發達，然而客觀的檢討，對外方面，有一個很大的缺點，對內方面也有一個很大的缺點，前者在缺乏民族的自主性，後者在缺乏民族的全體性。由前言之，因爲缺乏民族的自主性，所以事變以前，報社通訊社儘管是中國人自已辦的，而新聞電訊的報道，所受英美報社和通訊福的操縱愚弄，流毒至深，這種情形一方面影響一般閱者對時局的正確認識，一方面更成爲國內政潮挑撥離間推波助瀾的因素。這種情形，不只在中國爲然，整個東亞也深受其毒。還都開始，我們就創立中央社，使之成爲全國唯一的代表國家的新聞電訊機關，並且由中央社與盟邦同盟社結成平等互惠的合作，以此爲基幹，再進而與其他友邦通訊社取得合作，這就是要由中國新聞報道之自主，更進而求東亞新聞報道之自主。由後言之，因爲缺乏民族的全體性，所以事變以前，尤其是軍閥專橫時代，一方面統治階級不是仇視輿論，摧殘之惟恐不力，便是污辱輿論，拿來做掩耳盜鈴的御用機關，而另一方面，經營報案的人，由於封建意識的浸淫，由於個人主義的影響，往往忽視了新聞事業對國家民族的責任，對文化宣傳的使命，忽視新聞事業之公的性格，有的把報社通訊社看做營利的工具，有的假藉報社通訊社來做黨同伐異挾恨攻訏的手段，使一般讀者的精神意志，日日受社會黑暗面的濡染，而消失在光明面向上發展的勇氣。一個民族的生存和發展，最重要的條件，無過於激勵民族全體共同向上而統一的意志，過去封建時代的殘餘意識，個人自由主義的觀念，以及御用輿論的做法，處處障碍眞正民意的表露，處處銷毀民族全體共同向上的精神，處處妨害民族全體統一的意志，也就是處處摧殘民族的生存和發展。本來新聞事業站在引導民衆的地位，而又介乎政府與人民之間，其最大的功能，一方面在宣揚國策，一方面在暢達民意，使民衆團結一致，並使政府與民衆打成一片，祗有這樣纔能夠激勵民族全體共同向上而統一的意志，纔夠得上做民意的表率，輿論的總滙，纔有存在的價值和健全的發展。還都以來，我們對於扶植各地新聞事業之發展，抱定了一個根本方針，就是要使中國新聞事業，由私的性格走向公的性格。因爲我們深切認識，沒有正確的國策，民意固然無所依歸，沒有眞正的民意，任何國策也無從澈底實現。英美侵略主義的時代已經過去了，軍閥專橫的時代也已經過去了，我們今日○要確立新聞事業之民族自主性，○要確立新聞事業之民族全體性，兩件事實在是一件事，自主性不能確　，則所謂全體必不能健全，反之，全體性不能確立，則所謂自主也祗空有其名。因此我們今日要確立新聞事業的自主性和全體性，要使今後的新聞事業得到適應人民需要適應國家需要，適應東亞需要之健全的發展，旣有待於大東亞戰爭之完遂，尤有賴於新聞界全體共同的積極的自發的努力。這是中國新聞協會的第二個使命。</p>
<h3>全國報業自由而健全的發展</h3>
<p>常常聽見有人評論[新聞統制][言論統制]一個名詞，我痛恨這個名詞，尤其痛恨這名詞所附着的殘酷的血淚的事實，想起我們和軍閥以及一切反動勢力搏鬥的往事，那一種創鉅痛深的經過，到今猶深深印在我們每一個人的腦海裹，我們痛恨軍閥以及一切反動勢力，對民意的壓迫，對輿論的摧殘，我們需要自由，我們需要言論自由，然而我們所需要的不是爲個人的自由，而是爲國家民族的自由，爲東亞全體的自由，因此我會經大胆地提出國家計劃新聞制度的政策，我更熱烈的期望着政府與新聞界的共同努力，使這個　　能夠一步一步的確立起來。在這一個制度底下，除了上述雨大使命之外，全國新聞事業，每一個時期重點何在？每一個地區重點何在？以至於每一個報社重點何在？都要根據爲國家民族的自由，爲東亞全體的自由一個原則，以縝密的籌劃，合理的配置，使個個能得到自由而健全的發展。至於報業資格的配備，自紙張機器以至於廢紙鉛屑，報業從業人員之培養與保障，自編輯經理以至於工人報販，也都得要有通盤的打算，務使人力物力有應得的代價，無無謂的消耗。過去幾年，宣傳部會設立報業經理處，着手於此，然而這一切實有待於報業全體共同的努力，纔能有所成就，就算政府一方面有這個計劃，或者某一個報社有這個計劃，如果不是報業全體共同努力，不是政府與新聞界共同的協力，也是做不到的。從前報業經理處所經辦的幾件業務，盼望協會成立之後能夠接受政府的委託，爲更有效的推進。這幾年來盟邦方面對於我國報業的改進，特別是資財方面，協助甚大，盼望協會工作，積極推進，期毌負盟邦的摯望。至於尚有在計劃中而尚未付之實施的，例如各種從業人員工會之組織，活動，及其生活的保障等等，亦爲刻不容緩之事，政府自必着力於此，盼望協會方面也能着力於此。這是中國新聞協會的第三個使命。　　末了，願借這個機會，對盟邦各方面歷年以來協助中國報業之發展，以及此次協助新聞協會之創立，對盟邦在華報社之熱誠參與協會，對新聞界同人歷年的奮鬥，及此次之團結一致，表示無限的警意和感謝。謹以以上三點，祝中國新聞協會前途的發展，祝中國新聞界全體的團結，祝中日兩國新聞事業合作的光明。</p>

<h3>文化人的任務○答重慶文化人的批判</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>一位朋友告訴說，重慶方面的報紙在批評我。一直到最近，才得到這張報紙。果然，七月二十八日的東南日報上，刋登着阿匹一篇標題爲[斥吉田東祐]的文章。我們暫且看看原文開宗明義的第一段。　　[吉田東祐是日本的中國通，近來常常在申報上發表一些言論，自認相當地了解中國人的民族性，出過兩個言論集，國約翰根室爲[抬人牙　][人云亦云]，所以他的[通]顯然和約翰根室不同。也眞的有點不同。在他的言論集第二集序裹，他自己承認有[一部份讀者]，[或許因這本言論集的作者是日本人，而就不大舒服]。為了使他的[通]得以貫澈起見，他便嘲罵這種[不大舒服]爲要不得，舉了一個例道：　　[試看日本一個故事。某一壞人想敗騙慈悲的藩主，而使藩主褒獎自己，於是這位平常並不教順的他，在藩主的眼光所能達到的地方，背負着龍鐘老平，無微不至地佯作孝子。藩主看見，便非常欽佩他的教道，立刻賜與一封賞金。然而後來，明白了他是著名的惡棍，是爲了欺騙藩主而得賞，才假裝孝順老母的。藩主的家人非常憤慨，而想捉住這個惡棍，處以刑罰。但藩主不許，說：我老早就知道這個傢伙是一個壞蛋，然而縱令是一個壞蛋，如裝出孝子的樣子來，就可獲得獎賞，如瞭解這一點，一般人就會倣傚這個壞蛋，而假作教道；假如全體社會都假裝孝道，那末對於壞人社會，是有造成良風美俗希望的。]　　這意思很顯然，是要讀者把人們的言與行分割開來，不管作者滿肚皮懷的是什麼鬼胎，讀者儘相信作者嘴上的仁義道德，天下也就少事多了。上述這個例子，在我們看來，那藩主提倡的是[裝]，不是[孝]，在吉田東祐看來，[裝]未始不是[孝]，甚至也正是[孝]，所以他接着說：[正如該藩主所正確指出，不管行爲者的動機如何，而行爲旣表現於外部，則行爲本身就與行爲者的動機脫離，而是具有獨自客觀性的。……至於說同一作品，如日本人所寫者就錯誤，中國人所寫者就正確，這種民族主義態度，早　是時代的落伍者了。]日本人儘可以如心如意地壓榨中國人，雖然窮兇極惡，也無損於日本人嘴巴上的甜頭，有誰敢於批評這嘴巴上的甜頭，正是壓榨工具之一，那末，[這種民族主義態度，早已是時代落伍者]了。言外之意，要做時代先驅者的話，首先就得承認言行可以不一致。你應該清楚，日本人若其行盜　而其口君子，他仍是君子。若其行盜賊而其口並不君子，也一樣是君子。這裹主要的有一個前提：因爲他是日本人—征服者。]　　批評他人文章時，首先應當完全理解對方文章的意義。而阿匹君披露我的文章，並下一判斷說：[這意思很顯然，是要讀者把人們的言與行分割開來，不管作者滿肚皮懷的是什麼鬼胎，讀者盡相信作者嘴上的仁義道德。]阿匹君的批評是否得當，可完全決定於這一判斷之正確與否。在他的文章中，他竟把這樣一個重要的[判斷]隨便說出來。　　但我會明顯地說過：[正如該藩主所正確指出，不管行爲者的動機如何，而行爲旣經表現於外部，則行爲本身就與行爲者的動機脫離，而是具有獨自客觀性的。假如拙笨的畫家拿起筆來想畫虎，但玏成的圖不是虎而像錨，那末這張圖就是貓圖。現在我即使爲欺騙中國人而寫文章，而假如該文章在客觀上具有眞理，那末在文化上就具有價值。我在此要着重指出者，即文化作品與作者本人人格是具有相互不同的客觀性的。]　　恕我冒昧，我爲使阿匹君切實瞭解我的文革意義起見，而再舉一個稍微極端的例子。有一個累犯竊賊，他因爲知道倫人家東西不是一件好事，所以諄諄向自己的兒子勸誡：[你們大了決不要倫人家東西]。姑且不管這種勸誡是否有效，但[不要倫人家東西]這句話，卻見與仁義道德恰恰相符。所以孔子明明白白地說過：[君子不以言舉人，不以人廢言]。這句話的意義，就是說，君子並不因某人說得話好而就用他，同時也不能按某人的人格如何而立刻判斷他的話是錯誤的。或許阿匹君因爲這是日本人吉田東祐下的解釋，而就說錯誤吧，但眞理決不因是日本人說的就錯誤，因是中國人說的就正確。換言之，言語的正確與否，是與發言者的人格無關，而是決定於言語內容本身的。反過來說，假如凡壞人的話都錯誤，凡好人的話都正確，那末事情就會離奇了。假如竊賊在法庭上自首說：[是我偷這件東西了]，那末法官就應當立刻對他無罪釋放。因爲壞人的話旣不正確，那末他說[偷東西了]，豈不是[沒偷東西]的意思麼？旣然阿匹君所認爲是日本侵略者代言人吉田東祐之類的言語，就認爲不對，那末我假如對人　美[阿匹君是聰明人]，一般人就該相信[阿匹君是糊塗虫]　！此外假如全部實行阿匹君的言行一致論的話，則能夠成爲中國倫理學先生的人物，豈不是就要　種麼？　　阿匹君不知道自己的言行一致論會得出這樣錯誤百出的結論來，這是他的糊塗麼？恰相反，正是阿匹君的過人聰明處。這因爲他充分明瞭我所說的言語與人格間的關係，他才在引句中刪去畫虎不成反類貓的拙笨畫家這一例子，這就是不願呌讀者知道的意思。（請注意！他在引句中只刪去了這一點）。這樣狡猾的阿匹君，是毫無天良的評論家麼？我認爲並不如此。這位阿匹君表面上的[狡猾]，恰是阿匹君[天良]發現的另一形式。正是這一點，就是戰時文化人所共同感覺到的煩悶。最重要的一個原因，即因爲阿匹君是沿着重慶的抗戰文化政策大道前進的，而對於日本人如吉田東祐之言論對中國人的影響力，是不能不加以封鎖的一個愛國文化人。然而抨擊中最感困難者，即吉田東祐會明明白白證明了作品與人格不同，而具有獨自的客觀價值這一點。由於作品與人格無關，所以中國人便想放棄作者是日本人這一觀點，而檢討吉田言語的內容。他認爲這是一件最危險的傾向。所以爲使中國人絕對不能信任任何日本人的言語，他就不得不把我這一點的明白說明，在民衆面前掩飾起來。於是阿匹君就爲政治目的而犧牲文化天良，而對於我的文章就如以歪曲，然後造成易於攻擊的形態。更正確一點說，阿匹君在這一戰爭時代所以爲政治目的而犧牲文化　良者，是他認爲這是愛國行動所致。那末，我就不能不對於可敬愛的阿匹君再談一下政治與文化的關係。在明天的文章中要討論這一問題，所以就略多談了幾句阿匹君的話。（魯譯）</p>

        <h1>1944.09.26</h1>
<h3>Public Opinion and the Clearness of Discussions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Press Association held its inaugural meeting in this city, electing Mr. Li Zanhou as its president. Mr. Lin, the Minister of Propaganda, and representatives from the allied nations' Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy's reporting departments attended to provide guidance. Representatives from newspapers across the country participated, creating a lively atmosphere. As a member of this association, we offered a few words yesterday.</p>
<p>In his address at the inaugural meeting yesterday, President Li proposed three self-expectations, with the second point mentioning [strengthening public opinion and fostering clear discussions]. As this national press association begins, bringing together responsible representatives from the entire newspaper industry, urging unity, maximizing the efficiency of publicity, and achieving the greatest mission of propaganda, strengthening public opinion and fostering clear discussions are indeed the most crucial and necessary tasks.</p>
<p>Clear discussions are synonymous with public opinion. Before the advent of newspapers, the scholar-official class and the impartial gentry class expressed their criticisms of the political situation and suggestions for the people's demands, echoing each other, gradually forming a kind of clear discussion. The government placed great importance on these clear discussions, and society greatly respected them. Consequently, these clear discussions gained power. Of course, these clear discussions must be based on the demands of the public interest and on rational decisions.</p>
<p>Since the advent of newspapers, previous clear discussions could be published in the newspapers at any time. Through the power of newspapers, they could be quickly disseminated to the masses, echoing each other, gradually forming a trend of public opinion. The government should value public opinion, and society should respect it. Consequently, this public opinion gains power. Of course, this public opinion must also be based on the demands of the public interest and on rational decisions.</p>
<p>If there are clear discussions and public opinion in society, and the government values clear discussions and public opinion, and society respects clear discussions and public opinion, then politics will surely get on track, and social order will also get on track. If, even though there are clear discussions and public opinion in society, the government does not value them, and society does not respect them, then politics will surely not get on track, and social order will also not get on track. Why? Because if the government does not value clear discussions and public opinion, and society does not respect them, then, conversely, it means relying solely on the subjectivity of a few people and only listening to the opinions of a few people. And the subjectivity and opinions of these few people are certainly based on the interests of those few people and are certainly based on the emotional decisions of those few people. For example, if a few people in the government are corrupt or a few people in society are hoarding and speculating, this kind of behavior is based on the interests of a few people and stems entirely from personal greed. They do not respect clear discussions and public opinion and are not afraid of them. As a result, illegal behavior is not sanctioned but is taken as an honor, exaggerating their capabilities and神通 (supernatural powers/connections). This phenomenon further reflects the powerlessness of clear discussions and public opinion.</p>
<p>Finally, to hope for others to value and respect something, one must first value and respect it oneself. At the same time, one must have a way of valuing and respecting it before one can gain the valuation and respect of others. Therefore, we in the press should also deeply examine ourselves and strictly restrain ourselves. Colleagues in the press, especially those in leadership positions, should have the spirit of being unyielding to force, incorruptible by wealth, and unwavering in poverty, thinking of the public interest and relying entirely on reason to foster clear discussions and create public opinion, in order to arouse the government's attention and society's respect.</p>
<h3>China Press Association Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Press Industry Will See Greater Unity. To concentrate strength, achieve its own unity and improvement tasks, promote national policies, communicate public opinion, and fulfill its reporting mission, the national press industry organized the China Press Association. After active preparations in February, it was officially established yesterday. The plenary meeting of all members was held at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Federation of Industry and Commerce Association meeting room in the Wai Tan Xingya Building. Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and Mr. An Weiyi, Director of the Information Department of the Embassy, personally participated in the guidance. Several dozen representatives from local member newspaper offices, including Guo Xiufeng, Xu Liqiu, and Chen Binhe, gathered together, creating an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of China's press. The inauguration ceremony was held at 3:00 PM, with Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and officials from the three departments of the allied nations' Army, Navy, and Overseas Affairs personally attending and providing guidance, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

Finally, congratulatory telegrams from China and Japan were read, and the ceremony concluded, with everyone taking a group photo.</p>
<h3>President's Speech</h3>
<p>President Li Sihao delivered an opening speech, saying: Gentlemen, the China Press Association is established today, and I am very ashamed to be elected president, because I ask myself that my knowledge is barren and I have little connection with the press. I am sincerely afraid that I will fail the expectations of the government and the public. However, since I have accepted the heavy trust and feel the seriousness of the current situation, the press, standing in the position of pioneers of the times, should fully exert its inherent effectiveness. Today, I would like to set three expectations for myself and for others. First, special attention should be paid to the hardships of the people. People generally praise newspapers [as the voice of the people], that is, representing the people's speech. China is a [Republic], the Chinese government is a [National Government], and some people even say that [officials are the servants of the people]. Therefore, whether objectively or subjectively, the interests of the people must be valued first, especially the hardships of the people, which must be pointed out in detail and tirelessly, prompting the relevant parties to pay attention to improvement. Second, strengthen public opinion and foster clear discussions. Public opinion itself should also continuously seek progress, with the interests of the people as the subjective and the government's environment as the objective, creating a clear discussion trend that the people accept and the government values. Third, the above two points are what the press itself should grasp. At the same time, it is hoped that the government and the allied nations will pay special attention to respecting public opinion, not only not hindering it, but also maintaining the dignity of the press. I believe that the press can grasp the goal, continuously seek progress, and at the same time obtain the guarantee of respecting public opinion from the authorities, so that the mission of the press can be fulfilled, and the China Press Association will move forward along this path.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Congratulatory Message</h3>
<p>The China Press Association is holding its inaugural meeting in Shanghai today, at the stage of decisive battle, bringing together the strength of the national press and the allied nations' reporters in China to shoulder the important task of ideological warfare under the decisive battle, which is of great significance. Your association is an unprecedented large organization in the history of China's press, and it is also a great new contribution to the cooperation and unity of the press in China and Japan. It is deeply believed that after the establishment of your association, each member newspaper will, under unified leadership, exert the strength of the entire press with the same goal, the same belief, and the same steps, and complete the mission of cultural warfare and ideological warfare. In the past, China's press was deeply dyed with liberalism, forming a situation of each acting on its own. Now, the establishment of your association will certainly eliminate this weakness, advance the road of group development, and make the connection between the government and public opinion organs closer, so that no estrangement will occur, and the true public opinion will be freely expressed, cooperating with the government's intention to respect speech, assisting in the improvement of politics, perfecting the decisive battle system, and further striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the revival and construction of the new China. I am very honored that your association is holding its inaugural meeting in Shanghai this time, and I am the mayor of Shanghai. I sincerely wish your association's affairs will flourish and China's press will develop infinitely.</p>
<h3>Director Guan's Speech</h3>
<p>Director Guan of the Information Bureau of the Political Affairs Office of the North China Political Affairs Committee delivered the following congratulatory speech: Today is the auspicious day for the establishment of the China Press Association. I am here on behalf of the North China Xinbao to attend the grand ceremony from afar, and I will say a few words on behalf of President Guan Yixian. What I am going to say is divided into three parts. The first part can be said to be my sincere congratulations to the association. The second part is to report on the general situation of the press system in North China. The third part is the expectation of the press in North China for the association. The establishment of the National Press Association is still an initiative in our country. This is not only to meet the requirements of the decisive battle system, but also symbolizes the development of our country's press. In the future, under the promotion and guidance of the association, our country's press can concentrate all its efforts to engage in its own duties, and the mission of the press to the country will be completed as soon as possible. This is one of the things that we can congratulate. The Basic Outline of the Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates the establishment of the China Cultural Federation to prepare the national cultural propaganda system. The Cultural Federation is a unified organization of publishing, news writing, and other associations. Now, the establishment of the China Press Association is the prelude to the establishment of the Cultural Federation. It will be seen that our country's cultural undertakings will take on the mission of the times and move forward. This is the second thing that we can congratulate. The news agency is an organ for expressing public opinion and a place for leading proper public opinion. The unification of national news agencies is tantamount to the consistency of national opinion, and it gives us a premonition of the unification of the entire country. We believe that after the establishment of the association, this auspicious sign will not be difficult to become a reality. This is the third thing we can congratulate.

<p>Declaration of the General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association: The Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage. The establishment of this association at this time is entirely based on the requirements of the times. We hereby state our future mission to correct it before the people of the country. Today is the critical moment for the survival of the East Asian nation. If we do not devote all our strength to participate in the war, it will not be enough to annihilate the stubborn enemy and complete the war. The press has always been listed as the fourth front. It should cooperate and fight hard, so as not to fail to be a powerful member of the total war. Peace is indivisible, and war is even more indivisible. Our press is fighting for Sino-Japanese peace, and we should swear to rise up for the Greater East Asia Liberation War. To achieve the national revolution, we must first awaken the people. The press is the vanguard of the revolution, and it is undoubtedly its duty. We must adhere to our posts and refute fallacies in order to strengthen the will of the people to share the same enemy and consolidate the belief in final victory. The Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate the East Asian nation. Last January, the National Government declared war on the enemy. It is not only the long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation for a century, but also the common requirement of all nations and countries in Greater East Asia. The national policy is where the press must absolutely abide by, strive to promote, and awaken the people to support it. We should gather all the strength of the whole people, under the leadership of the National Government, to form a strong fortress to crush the aggressive dreams of Britain and the United States. Modern warfare is a total war. It not only launches a decisive battle in the military, political, and economic fields, but also decides its victory in ideological warfare. With the belief of victory, there will be the fruits of victory, and the birth of belief is due to thought. If we want to seek the unity of the whole country, from top to bottom, we must communicate smoothly in thought, so that there is no gap between the government and the public. Under consistent cooperation, we will be able to make the belief of victory more firm, and the completion of the war can also be expected. Since we are standing at the head of the ideological war, we swear to take the national policy as our position, guide the people, cooperate with the government, promote public opinion, and improve people's livelihood. Under the guidance of the government, the people will unite sincerely, the government will widely collect public opinion, and strengthen administration. The total strength of the country can be fully exerted, and the final victory must be won. Today's public opinion is the public opinion of the whole people and the whole country, not the private opinions of a certain department or faction. We must give play to the social and public character, eliminate the color of individual capitalism, and strive to promote national policies and cooperate with the war in various different characteristics. In today's total efforts to serve the country, we only have one heart to guide and unify our steps. With the spirit of serving the public and forgetting ourselves, we will carry out the sacred mission of our press. The war has reached the decisive moment. The rise and fall of our East Asian nation is at stake. In order to concentrate its own strength, the press has the organization of this association. We are willing to seek the unity and improvement of the press itself internally, and to promote national policies and communicate public opinion externally, and to cooperate with the national people to complete the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Chairman</h3>
<p>The Embassy of the Republic of China in Tokyo forwards to Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government: We believe that the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, and the rise and fall of the East Asian nation is at stake. In order to promote national policies, communicate public opinion, exert all its strength, and assist in the war, our country's press has the organization of this association. Internally, it will unite the national newspapers to cooperate and strive together. Externally, it will guide the people to cooperate with the government, gather ideas and broaden its thinking, and strengthen administration. Now, this association has been formally established today, vowing to exert the power of the fourth front under your leadership in order to achieve the purpose of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. We send our telegram of respect, and we pray for your inspection, and wish you good health in your political affairs. The General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association bows (25th).</p>
<h3>Telegram to Comfort the Soldiers</h3>
<p>The East Asia Liberation War is becoming increasingly fierce. The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, annihilating the stubborn British and American enemies, and crushing the aggressive dreams. They put life and death out of their minds and save East Asia from danger. Their hard work and great achievements are inspiring. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we are willing to do our best to arouse the people to cooperate in the war and stabilize the rear. We send our telegram of condolence and extend our most respectful regards. The General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association (25th).</p>

As a result, the enemy landing troops, relying solely on artillery cover, have had to make continuous artillery bombardments. Now that their ammunition is exhausted, and the enemy landing troops' will to fight is visibly reduced, the enemy has retreated into bunkers and made tanks retreat to the rear, adopting a defensive posture.

The Chongqing army was also afraid that the loss of Guilin would affect the war situation, so it also decided to defend Guilin to the death. Recently, a large army has been assembled in that area, transferred from Sichuan and Yunnan. The 93rd Army, which boasts American equipment, and the 5th, 52nd, and 76th Armies, etc., and the 46th and 31st Armies of the former Fourth War Area are gathered in the Guilin and Liuzhou areas.

An equal number of empty ships are returning to the Pacific coast. The number of ships carrying cargo is estimated to be roughly the same. To fight in the Pacific, the United States must prepare at least 600 ships every day. Therefore, even if the war in Europe ends, the U.S. wartime transportation burden may not be reduced, and the burden on the Pacific coast will actually increase."</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Chinese and Japanese Press Circles Completes a Major Mission</h3>
<p>Allied Nations' Three Reporting Chiefs Congratulate the Establishment of the Association</p>
<p>At the inaugural meeting of the China News Association, the reporting chiefs of the Allied Nations' Japanese Army, Navy, and Overseas Affairs all attended to provide guidance and deliver congratulatory speeches. First, Mr. Kishi, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech, followed by Mr. Matsushima, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Fleet Stationed in China, and finally, Mr. Miura, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Dispatch Army Stationed in China, representing Mr. Yamauchi, Chief of the Shanghai Army Reporting Department. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Speech by Chief Kishi</h3>
<p>The China News Association, which was previously in the planning stages, has now been formally established and held its inaugural ceremony today, which is a cause for great celebration. The current war situation is intensifying and has entered the final decisive stage. The countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are exerting all their strength under the belief of certain victory and invincibility to liberate East Asia and build East Asia for the people of East Asia. At this time, the organization and establishment of the China News Association is of great significance, and its responsibilities are also becoming increasingly heavy. Modern warfare is not only decided by the military strength of the belligerent countries, but by the total war of the ideology, production, strength, and all other forces of the country and its people. In particular, ideological warfare assumes extremely important departments, such as transmitting intentions from above to below and conditions from below to above, guiding the masses, propaganda and enlightenment, and the promotion of public opinion. This time, the newspapers of China have united to form this association, and under the same goal and the same belief, they are exerting all their strength to promote national policies and facilitate public opinion. This is not only giving greater power to the liberation propaganda war in China, but also making a great contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Regarding the measures to enhance the propaganda war, the issue of respecting national public opinion, which was proposed, was previously expressed by Vice Minister Zhang of your country's Propaganda Department. Subsequently, there will be lively discussions on this issue, and various newspapers will write articles to explore it. As for our country, we have also successively disclosed our opinions on promoting the war spirit and facilitating national speech at the 85th extraordinary session of the Diet. Regarding this point, Prime Minister Koiso, President Ogata of the Information Bureau, and Minister of Home Affairs Oda have respectively replied, saying that the public opinion policy in the decisive stage is to clarify public opinion and make people's hearts only go towards the war, and rather than improperly suppressing public opinion, how to make the fervent public opinion reach the highest level. Although it is called respecting public opinion, any speech that violates national policy, divides domestic public opinion, damages the country, or even tends to private interests and desires, and aims to protect oneself, as well as unsound speech that is prone to other malpractices, the authorities should severely crack down on it, which is a matter of course. On the other hand, it is also important to promote sound and unobstructed constructive speech to clarify public opinion in terms of completing the total war system. In this regard, there is still a lot of room for the association to make full efforts. Chinese newspapers have always had a business color and a tendency to be privately owned. Therefore, with the establishment of this association, we can expect it to be self-aware of its public nature and to develop soundly for the purpose of promoting national policy. This is truly commendable. The Japanese side expresses its full approval of the epoch-making progress of the Chinese press. The Japanese newspapers in China have also gladly decided to participate together, so that Chinese and Japanese journalists can often exchange opinions face-to-face, the Chinese and Japanese sides can become one, and they can cooperate to actively promote the propaganda war. This is also truly commendable. In addition, regarding the issue of the supply of materials indispensable to the newspaper business, the Japanese side has to bear all the responsibility. Regarding this, we have the determination to assist the association with all possible efforts. However, because there are many restrictions under the decisive battle situation today, under these circumstances, we sincerely hope that the parties concerned of the association can also fully understand the situation and cooperate more on the fair distribution of materials and effective utilization. In any case, we Japanese authorities will spare no effort to cooperate in nurturing the Wood Association. This is what we want to reiterate here again. We also ask Chairman Li and all the executives and members of the association to work together to achieve the mission of this association, which is what we sincerely hope for. Finally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to all the members of the preparatory committee of this association for their great efforts before the establishment of this association, and at the same time, we wish the establishment of this association and pray for its future development.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Speech by Chief Matsushima</h3>
<p>Today, with the attendance of Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, the inaugural ceremony of the News Association is held so grandly, and the Navy, as one of the guiding institutions, shares the deep joy. Tracing back to the time when the establishment plan of this association came into being, it has been more than a year. During this period, under the enthusiastic research and cooperation of all parties concerned, it was able to make satisfactory progress and was established this time. In both tangible and intangible aspects, it is a very important unified control mechanism for future cultural propaganda work. There is no doubt that it will make a great contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia in the future. In particular, the fact that it includes North and South China in its promising institutions and produces a great cultural camp in which the entire China is united can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. We feel even more keenly the importance of the mission of this association, and we sincerely hope that both the guiding party and the association will stand on the position of the overall situation, carry out close cooperation, and move towards the completion of its lofty moon's future. We would like to offer this as a congratulatory message.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Speech by Chief Izubuchi</h3>
<p>Today, I am honored to be one of the honored guests at this grand ceremony. On behalf of one party, I would like to extend my congratulations. At the time when the Greater East Asia War, which determines the rise and fall of East Asia, is about to unfold a major decisive battle, a good day has been specially selected, and the formal establishment of the China News Association is announced today, which has great significance. I would like to express my full congratulations to the press circles in China under wartime. At the same time, I would like to express my heartfelt respect to Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and other officials and gentlemen who have devoted many years of effort to the establishment of this association. The current war situation is becoming more and more important, and there is no need to say more. In order to enhance the national war spirit, to make the belief of certain victory more solid, and at the same time, to launch a stronger and more powerful ideological war against the enemy Britain and the United States, and to strengthen the propaganda offensive, this requirement is more important today than ever before. Therefore, the National Government established the Supreme National Defense Council in June of this year and passed the Basic Outline of China's Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy. The wisdom of the National Government is commendable. Therefore, the News Association, which has just been established today, is organized based on the outline and is one of the most important institutions responsible for the implementation of the wartime cultural propaganda policy. This association is the core of the mainland Chinese reporting camp. It will bring together all the Chinese and Japanese newspapers in China under the peace government under its jurisdiction to form a strong siege, and we are confident that it will exert great power in the area of propaganda reporting, a major battle force in the total war. However, the scope of business of this association extends to the fact of materials, which is expected to be more difficult under the decisive battle. Therefore, the establishment of the part related to news production materials is also to facilitate allocation and adjustment. I believe that this will make a great contribution to the operation of the newspapers participating in the association. From this point of view, the future of this association is great, and I wish the future development is infinite. Finally, I would like to pay my respects to the spirit of the late Mr. Yanagimachi Sei, who devoted his energy to the establishment of this association, but unfortunately failed to witness today's establishment. My words are simple and crude, and I offer this as a congratulatory message.</p>

<h3>Strictly Manage Prices and Implement the Tagging System</h3>
<p>Remarks by Director Wu Ming of the Economic Security Office</p>
<p>Regarding the management of prices, Director Wu Ming of the Economic Security Office made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Implementing economic controls under the extraordinary circumstances is an indispensable policy for enhancing national power. Among them, the management of prices is of utmost importance for stabilizing people's livelihood, which need not be reiterated.</p>
<p>Regarding the commodities sold in various stores in Shanghai, the Wan Gong Bureau issued Notice No. 5984 on June 30, 1942, establishing a price tag sales system. Subsequently, on January 13, 1944, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Price Management, and then the Ministry of Industry stipulated implementation measures, universally organizing price management committees across the country. At the same time, the economic authorities strictly ordered that all commodities for sale should have price tags. It is believed that most merchants are already familiar with this.</p>
<p>However, recently, there are still many unscrupulous merchants in the city who disregard the law, pay lip service but act against it, and take advantage of the rising prices to obtain illegal profits, which is a great regret for stabilizing people's livelihood. In view of this, this time the Ministry of Industry strictly ordered the strong implementation of the management policy. Upon receiving this, the Municipal Economic Bureau and this Economic Security Office, in order to awaken illegal merchants and emphasize cooperation with the authorities' policies, on September 17, clarified the Municipal Economic Bureau's policy, so that all shops and provinces, in addition to publishing prices, should pay for price tags, and others that are not stipulated also have the need to pay for them. This Economic Security Office will recently investigate the implementation of the price tag system in order to thoroughly implement the policy of managing prices. I hope that the persons in charge of each store will understand the intention of the authorities and not have any violations, and strictly abide by the regulations.</p>
<h3>More Than Thirty Stores Found Operating Overtime</h3>
<p>Penalties Imposed According to the Severity of the Circumstances</p>
<p>The municipal authorities previously restricted the operating hours of various industries, which was strictly enforced by the police bureau. Recently, it was found that some illegal stores, firms, and entertainment venues were deliberately operating overtime. There were more than thirty in total, and they have been punished with suspension of business or fines depending on the severity of the violations.</p>
<h3>The Rice Control Committee Establishes Offices Universally</h3>
<p>The Rice Grain Control Committee will launch the purchase of new rice from this year's autumn harvest in the middle of next month. However, in order to achieve unified collection and distribution and smooth operation, it will universally establish offices in various provinces, cities, and counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. A provincial office will be established in each province, and a regional office will be established below the provincial office. Within the jurisdiction of the region, branch offices will be established depending on the situation. It is heard that in the near future, the institutions of each office will be fully established.</p>
<h3>Travelers to North China Must Have Epidemic Prevention Certificates</h3>
<p>The sixth meeting of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee decided that the second phase of cholera vaccination will end at the end of this month. The committee has now received a telegram from the North China Medical and Health Committee of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, stating that since true cholera patients have recently occurred in the occupied areas of Hunan Province in Central China, after consultation with the Allied authorities, quarantine will be implemented for travelers from Central and Southern China to the north from today onwards. All travelers to North China must hold a vaccination certificate valid for three months or less in order to enter the country. In addition to informing the relevant agencies for investigation, it is hoped that citizens of this port who have not received the second phase of vaccination will be vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent the invasion of epidemics.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Money Orders Must Be Paid with Residence Permits</h3>
<p>Shanghai Post Office Notice: In view of the fact that telegraphic money orders have high amounts, for the sake of caution, all telegraphic money orders sent to individuals must be paid with the recipient's residence permit.</p>
<h3>Japanese Language Teachers Hold a Symposium</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau convened a symposium for Japanese language teachers from various schools in the city, totaling about fifty people, at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 25th). Allied officials Mr. Nakata, Secretary, and Mr. Takayama, Investigator, and Director Dai also attended and delivered speeches.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch Held a Grand Sketching Event Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a grand sketching event at the Mitsui &amp; Co. Clubhouse Garden on Huangshan Road at 10:00 AM on the 24th. More than thirty Chinese and Japanese painters attended.</p>
<h3>Three County Procuratorial Sub-Courts Abolished; County Magistrates Temporarily Administer Justice</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the judicial institutions in the counties of Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian in this city, the Ministry of Judicial Administration will establish Shanghai Local Procuratorial Sub-Offices and Shanghai Local Court Branch Courts in each county. The sub-offices originally established by the Shanghai Local Procuratorate in each county have now been ordered to be abolished, and all will be completed by the end of this month. Before the establishment of each Procuratorial Sub-Office and Local Branch Court, the county magistrates will temporarily administer justice.</p>
<h3>Funds Flowing from North China to Shanghai Reached 400 Million Yuan in July</h3>
<p>Since the Central Reserve Bank and the North China United Reserve Bank of China implemented currency exchange, the exchange of funds between Central China and North China has become increasingly smooth, and the mutual operation of materials between the North and the South has developed even further. The flow of funds from Shanghai to North China and from North China to Shanghai is constant, all for the purpose of merchants operating trade, which shows that the exchange of materials between the North and the South has promoted non-freshness. In the past two months, there has been a lot of funds flowing from North China to Shanghai. Some speculative merchants took the opportunity to incite people's hearts and make illegal profits from it. After the relevant authorities made a solemn statement on the matter, the unfounded rumors were all suppressed. According to the Central News Agency reporter's recent inquiries with the authority of financial institutions, the figures for funds flowing from North China to Shanghai are indeed more than those remitted from Shanghai to North China. For example, in July of this year, the funds remitted from North China to Shanghai were statistically more than 422.3 million yuan in the new currency, while those remitted from Shanghai to North China were only 22.3 million yuan in joint currency (approximately 13.2 million yuan in legal currency). However, this number of north-south exchange is actually necessary funds for north-south material trade.</p>

<h3>Fuhua Tobacco Company Generously Donates a Huge Sum for Scholarships, New New First Building Hosts Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's scholarship fund received a donation of 200,000 yuan from Mr. Jia Youliang yesterday, representing the proceeds from a small-scale charity football match organized by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. The company held the Fuhua Cup tournament, raising a total of over 820,000 yuan through ticket sales and donations, all of which was donated to charity. The company's dedication to charitable causes is truly admirable. Our newspaper, on behalf of the students in need, expresses our sincere gratitude. We also extend our gratitude to Madam Yu, Deng Ziying, and Yao Yuqing for their generous donations. The New New First Building, affiliated with the New New Company, has been preparing for several months, with opulent and magnificent interior decoration. It is scheduled to open today, and a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration will be co-hosted with our newspaper and the News Daily on October 1st. The program is exceptionally exciting, and all business revenue on that afternoon will be entirely donated to the scholarship funds of both newspapers. The company's enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. The original letter states: [To whom it may concern, The New New First Building affiliated with our company has been renovated and will open for business tomorrow. In response to your newspaper's scholarship fund and the News Daily's loan fund, we plan to co-host a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration with your newspaper and the News Daily, donating all proceeds from business during that time to your newspaper as a scholarship fund and the News Daily as a loan fund.

<h3>Calculation and Graphical Solution Marking Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Help Industrial Society wrote in a letter: [Dear Editor: The slide rule is a useful tool in engineering design, but in our country, except for simple slide rules that can be manufactured domestically, slightly more precise and complex ones must be obtained from abroad. At this time of inconvenient transportation, the cost of one slide rule can be as high as thousands of yuan, which is beyond the means of ordinary users. Mr. Wang Shuliang of our society, feeling this strongly, created the Calculation and Graphical Solution through research last year. The price is kept as low as possible, serving as a substitute for advanced slide rules. The functions of the diagram include calculating multiplication, division, any power, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and vectors. In particular, the calculation of any power and vectors is simpler than with the Loo-Lgovector slide rule. The design has taken more than a year to complete. It is now available for sale at Zhonghua, Baoquan, Dahua, Guangyi, and other locations. To commemorate the occasion, we are offering five copies to be awarded to students in the scholarship program who are studying mechanical, electrical, civil, or chemical engineering and have achieved excellent grades. Furthermore, our society has always supported the work-study system. If scholarship students wish to assist with sales, they can be introduced by your office, and special preferential terms will be offered to show our appreciation. Sincerely, the Help Industrial Society.</p>

After long and careful planning from all sides, the Chinese News Association was able to hold a grand founding ceremony today. Newspaper representatives from all over the country gathered together, and representatives of Allied newspapers in China also participated. Moreover, after unanimous election by all members, Mr. Li Zanhou, who has a high reputation, was elected as the president in his capacity outside the government. This is an epoch-making page in the history of Chinese journalism, and the heartfelt joy cannot be expressed in a few words. Why create a news association? Why gather newspapers from all over the country, and invite Allied newspapers in China, to jointly create the Chinese News Association at this time?</p>
<h3>Develop Great Spirit, Strengthen Decisive Battle Strength</h3>
<p>Because this is the stage of the decisive battle, because the Greater East Asia War is a war of ethnic coexistence against international aggression. On the enemy's side, it is a war of plunder, a war of destroying culture and destroying humanity. On our side, it is a war of righteousness, a war of promoting moral spirit and defending the welfare of mankind. As such, military strength is the main condition for the decisive battle, and spiritual strength is also the main condition for the decisive battle. While the soldiers at the front are sacrificing their lives in bloody battles to win the decisive battle, even if we have not abandoned the pen to join the military, our responsibility is no different from that of the soldiers at the front. We must develop a great spiritual strength, thereby increasing the material strength necessary for the decisive battle, and thereby strengthening the military strength used in the decisive battle. All the people in the rear have this responsibility, and the press, which is responsible for leading public opinion, should especially take on this responsibility. In terms of the revival of China, the Chinese press should shoulder this responsibility. In terms of defending East Asia, the press of China and Japan should unite in good faith and jointly shoulder this responsibility. This is the first mission of the Chinese News Association.</p>
<h3>Establish the Independence and Universality of the News Undertaking</h3>
<p>Chinese journalism has a long history and cannot be said to be without considerable development. However, objectively speaking, there is a major shortcoming externally and a major shortcoming internally. The former lacks national autonomy, and the latter lacks national universality. From the former, because of the lack of national autonomy, before the Incident, even though newspapers and news agencies were run by Chinese people themselves, the reporting of news and telecommunications was manipulated and deceived by British and American newspapers and telecommunications companies, with deep-rooted negative consequences. This situation, on the one hand, affected the general reader's correct understanding of the current situation, and on the other hand, became a factor in provoking discord and fueling domestic political conflicts. This situation is not only true in China, but the entire East Asia has also been deeply poisoned. Since the return to the capital, we have established the Central News Agency to make it the only national news and telecommunications organization representing the country, and the Central News Agency has formed equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with the Allied News Agency. Taking this as the foundation, we will further cooperate with other friendly news agencies. This is to seek independence in East Asian news reporting from the independence of Chinese news reporting. From the latter, because of the lack of national universality, before the Incident, especially during the era of military warlord autocracy, on the one hand, the ruling class either hated public opinion and tried to destroy it with all their might, or insulted public opinion and used it as a self-deceiving propaganda tool. On the other hand, those who run the newspaper business, due to the immersion of feudal consciousness and the influence of individualism, often ignored the responsibility of the news business to the country and the nation, the mission of cultural propaganda, and the public nature of the news business. Some regarded newspapers and news agencies as profit-making tools, and some used newspapers and news agencies to engage in partisan struggles and revenge attacks, causing the spirit and will of the general readers to be tainted by the dark side of society day by day, and losing the courage to develop towards the bright side. The most important condition for the survival and development of a nation is to encourage the common upward and unified will of the entire nation. In the past, the remaining consciousness of the feudal era, the concept of individual liberalism, and the practice of using public opinion, all hindered the expression of true public opinion, destroyed the common upward spirit of the entire nation, and hindered the unified will of the entire nation, which is to destroy the survival and development of the nation. Originally, the news business stands in the position of guiding the public, and it is also between the government and the people. Its greatest function is, on the one hand, to promote national policies, and on the other hand, to express public opinion, so that the people can unite and the government and the people can unite as one. Only in this way can we inspire the common upward and unified will of the entire nation, be worthy of being the representative of public opinion and the general assembly of public opinion, and have the value of existence and healthy development. Since the return to the capital, we have adhered to a fundamental policy for supporting the development of the news business in various places, that is, to make the Chinese news business move from a private character to a public character. Because we deeply recognize that without correct national policies, public opinion will naturally have nowhere to turn, and without true public opinion, no national policy can be thoroughly implemented. The era of Anglo-American aggression has passed, and the era of military warlord autocracy has also passed. Today we want to establish the national autonomy of the news business and establish the national universality of the news business. The two things are actually one thing. If autonomy cannot be established, then the so-called totality cannot be healthy. Conversely, if totality cannot be established, then the so-called autonomy is only in name. Therefore, today we must establish the autonomy and universality of the news business, so that the news business in the future can adapt to the needs of the people, adapt to the needs of the country, and adapt to the healthy development of East Asia, which not only depends on the completion of the Greater East Asia War, but also depends on the active and spontaneous efforts of the entire press community. This is the second mission of the Chinese News Association.</p>
<h3>The Free and Healthy Development of the National Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>I often hear people comment on the term [news control] and [speech control]. I hate this term, especially the cruel, bloody, and tearful facts attached to this term. Thinking of our past struggles with warlords and all reactionary forces, that kind of painful experience is still deeply imprinted in the minds of each of us. We hate warlords and all reactionary forces for their oppression of public opinion and destruction of public opinion. We need freedom, we need freedom of speech, but what we need is not freedom for individuals, but freedom for the country and the nation, freedom for the entire East Asia. Therefore, I have boldly proposed the policy of a national planned news system, and I am more eagerly looking forward to the joint efforts of the government and the news community to gradually establish this system. Under this system, in addition to the above-mentioned two major missions, what is the focus of the national news business in each period? What is the focus of each region? As for the focus of each newspaper? All should be based on the principle of freedom for the country and the nation and freedom for the entire East Asia, with careful planning and reasonable allocation, so that each can achieve free and healthy development. As for the allocation of newspaper qualifications, from paper machines to waste paper and lead shavings, the training and protection of newspaper practitioners, from editors and managers to workers and newspaper vendors, all must have a comprehensive plan to ensure that human and material resources have the deserved price and no unnecessary consumption. In the past few years, the Propaganda Department has set up a newspaper management office to start this work, but all of this still requires the joint efforts of the entire newspaper industry to achieve results. Even if the government has this plan or a newspaper has this plan, it will not be possible without the joint efforts of the entire newspaper industry and the joint cooperation of the government and the news community. It is hoped that the association will be able to accept the government's entrustment to promote the several businesses that the newspaper management office used to handle more effectively after the association is established. In recent years, the Allied countries have provided great assistance to the improvement of China's newspaper industry, especially in terms of capital. It is hoped that the association's work will be actively promoted, and that the expectations of the Allied countries will not be disappointed. As for those that are still in the planning stage and have not yet been implemented, such as the organization, activities, and livelihood security of various workers' unions, etc., are also matters of utmost urgency. The government will inevitably work hard on this, and it is hoped that the association will also work hard on this. This is the third mission of the Chinese News Association. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite vigilance and gratitude to all parties in the Allied countries for their assistance in the development of the Chinese newspaper industry over the years, and for their assistance in the establishment of the News Association this time, to the enthusiastic participation of the Allied newspapers in China in the Association, and to the struggle of the colleagues in the news industry over the years and their unity this time. I wish the Chinese News Association a bright future of development, the overall unity of the Chinese press, and the bright cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese news industries.</p>

<h3>The Task of Cultural Figures ○ Reply to the Criticism of Cultural Figures in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>A friend told me that newspapers in Chongqing were criticizing me. I only received this newspaper recently. As expected, the Southeast Daily on July 28th published an article by A Pi titled [Criticizing Yoshida Toyu]. Let's first look at the first paragraph of the original text: [Yoshida Toyu is a Japan expert on China, and has recently published some remarks in the Shen Bao, claiming to understand the Chinese national character quite well. He has published two collections of remarks, and is said to be different from John Ingall because he does not simply "parrot others." He really is a bit different. In the preface to the second collection of his remarks, he himself admits that [some readers] [may feel uncomfortable because the author of this collection of remarks is Japanese]. In order to ensure that his [understanding] is thorough, he ridicules this [uncomfortable feeling] as undesirable, and gives an example: [Consider a Japanese story. A certain bad person wanted to deceive a compassionate feudal lord and make the feudal lord praise himself, so this person, who was not usually obedient, carried his old mother on his back in a place where the feudal lord could see him, pretending to be filial. The feudal lord saw this and was very impressed by his filial piety, and immediately gave him a reward. However, later, he learned that he was a notorious villain, and that he was pretending to be filial to his old mother in order to deceive the feudal lord and get a reward. The feudal lord's family was very angry and wanted to arrest this villain and punish him. But the feudal lord refused, saying: I knew long ago that this guy was a bad egg, but even if he is a bad egg, if he pretends to be filial, he can get a reward. If he understands this, people will imitate this bad egg and pretend to be filial; if the entire society pretends to be filial, then there is hope for creating good customs in a society of bad people.] The meaning is obvious: it is to make readers separate people's words from their actions, and no matter what evil intentions the author has in mind, readers should just believe the author's benevolence and morality, and there will be fewer problems in the world. In our view, the feudal lord is promoting [pretending], not [filial piety]. In Yoshida Toyu's view, [pretending] is not necessarily not [filial piety], and is even precisely [filial piety]. So he goes on to say: [As the feudal lord correctly pointed out, regardless of the actor's motives, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is separated from the actor's motives and has its own objectivity. As for saying that the same work is wrong if it is written by a Japanese and correct if it is written by a Chinese, this kind of nationalism is already outdated.] Japanese people can squeeze the Chinese people as they please, and even if they are extremely vicious, it does not detract from the sweetness of the Japanese people's mouths. Anyone who dares to criticize this sweetness of the mouth, which is one of the tools of squeezing, then [this kind of nationalism is already outdated]. The implication is that if you want to be a pioneer of the times, you must first admit that words and actions can be inconsistent. You should be clear that if a Japanese person acts like a robber but speaks like a gentleman, he is still a gentleman. If he acts like a robber and does not speak like a gentleman, he is still a gentleman. There is one main premise here: because he is Japanese - a conqueror.] When criticizing someone else's article, one should first fully understand the meaning of the other party's article. But A Pi discloses my article and makes a judgment: [The meaning is obvious: it is to make readers separate people's words from their actions, and no matter what evil intentions the author has in mind, readers should just believe the author's benevolence and morality.] Whether A Pi's criticism is appropriate completely depends on whether this judgment is correct. In his article, he casually states such an important [judgment]. But I have clearly said: [As the feudal lord correctly pointed out, regardless of the actor's motives, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is separated from the actor's motives and has its own objectivity. If a clumsy painter picks up a pen and wants to draw a tiger, but the completed picture is not a tiger but looks like a cat, then this picture is a cat picture. Now, even if I write an article to deceive the Chinese people, if the article is objectively true, then it has cultural value. What I want to emphasize here is that cultural works and the author's own personality have mutually different objectivity.] Excuse my presumption, I will give another slightly extreme example in order to make A Pi truly understand the meaning of my literary revolution. There is a recidivist thief who knows that stealing things from other people is not a good thing, so he earnestly advises his son: [When you grow up, never steal things from other people]. Regardless of whether this advice is effective, the sentence [never steal things from other people] is exactly in line with benevolence and morality. Therefore, Confucius clearly said: [A gentleman does not promote people because of their words, nor does he reject words because of the person]. The meaning of this sentence is that a gentleman does not use someone just because they speak well, and at the same time, he cannot immediately judge that someone's words are wrong based on their personality. Perhaps A Pi says that this is wrong because it is an explanation given by the Japanese Yoshida Toyu, but the truth is never wrong just because it is said by a Japanese, and correct just because it is said by a Chinese. In other words, whether a statement is correct or not has nothing to do with the speaker's personality, but depends on the content of the statement itself. Conversely, if all the words of bad people are wrong, and all the words of good people are correct, then things will be bizarre. If a thief confesses in court and says: [I stole this thing], then the judge should immediately acquit him. Because the words of bad people are not correct, then when he says [stole something], doesn't it mean [didn't steal something]? Since A Pi believes that the words of Yoshida Toyu, a spokesperson for Japanese invaders, are wrong, then if I compliment A Pi and say [A Pi is a smart person], people should believe [A Pi is a muddlehead]! In addition, if A Pi's theory of consistency between words and actions is fully implemented, then wouldn't the figures who can become Chinese ethics teachers almost disappear? A Pi doesn't know that his theory of consistency between words and actions will lead to such erroneous conclusions. Is this his confusion? On the contrary, it is precisely A Pi's extraordinary intelligence. This is because he fully understands the relationship between language and personality that I am talking about. He deleted the example of the clumsy painter who failed to draw a tiger and instead drew a cat in the quote, which means that he does not want readers to know. (Please note! He only deleted this point in the quote). Is such a cunning A Pi a critic without conscience? I don't think so. The apparent [cunning] of this A Pi is precisely another form of the discovery of A Pi's [conscience]. This is precisely the boredom that wartime cultural figures feel in common. The most important reason is that A Pi is advancing along the path of Chongqing's anti-Japanese cultural policy, and is a patriotic cultural figure who cannot help but block the influence of the words of Japanese people like Yoshida Toyu on the Chinese people. However, the most difficult thing in the attack is that Yoshida Toyu will clearly prove that the work is different from the personality and has its own objective value. Because the work has nothing to do with the personality, the Chinese people want to abandon the view that the author is Japanese and examine the content of Yoshida's words. He believes that this is the most dangerous tendency. Therefore, in order to prevent the Chinese people from absolutely trusting any Japanese words, he has to hide my clear explanation of this point from the public. So A Pi sacrificed cultural conscience for political purposes, and distorted my article to create an easy-to-attack form. To be more precise, A Pi sacrificed cultural conscience for political purposes in this wartime era because he believed that this was an act of patriotism. Then, I have to talk to the admirable A Pi about the relationship between politics and culture again. This issue will be discussed in tomorrow's article, so I have said a few more words about A Pi.
