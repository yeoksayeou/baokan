<h3 id="c1">吿大學應屆畢業生 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，暑假將届，各大學應届畢業生已在離開學校而踏進社會之準備中。能受到高等敎育者，在中國全體國民中平時已佔少數，當此非常時期生活艱難之際，更覺得完成大學課程之難能而可貴。大學畢業生皆學有專長，而社會上各項事業正渴望着專門人才之參加發揮其技術，眼見將有一批「生力軍」之到達，孰不寄之以莫大歡忻與期待。但就以往之經騐而言，每年都有大批大學畢業生由藝校而進入社會，可是社會上所得到的效果與成績，往往不能如所預期，寢假而至於不重視大學畢業生，此在大學畢業生木身應特別加以反省者。大學平時教學之情形與畢業程度之水準，固與被人重視與否具有决定性之影響，姑不在此詳論。而另一方面關於處世之道未有深刻之認識，亦未始非其中重要原因之一。社會情形至為複雜，尤其洎乎晚近號稱為「萬惡之藪」，欲以賅括之詞而指示處世南針，誠然憂乎其難，但吾人正願就此一點略貢芻蕘，為大學應届畢業生告。</p>
<p>學校本為社會之縮影，况大學生多已成年，對於社會內容，亦未嘗不稍有接觸。可是學校範圍以內畢竟單純，初入社會究不免有所隔膜，因此不可不講求有系統的處世之道，而發揮靑年之力量，爰分三個階段論之：</p>
<p>第一階段曰「敬」。未離學校之前，大學生往往以咀駡社會鳴高，可是每皆「無病而呻」或者「隔靴搔癢」，這種習慣須從速改去，而到處以「敬」的態度處之。本個人之良知良能，以赤誠與社會周旋，方可奠定木人之基礎。否則不出於遁世絕俗寗與社會隔絕，必出於妄自菲薄願與社會同化，狂捐雖異然自絕其前程則一。須知無論社會如何黑暗，未嘗無一二點光明閃爍於其中。個人若能以「敬」自肅，保存朝氣，亦即所以增加一點光明，物以類聚，由此多數之一二點，便能然積而燦爛照耀。</p>
<p>第二階段曰「恕」。入社會較久，然後社會眞正之缺陷與罪惡，漸皆暴講與吾人之前，尤甚能以「敬」自肅者，則所見愈明，雖秋毫之末無所逃遁，於此必先處之以「恕」。「恕」者非妥協之謂，須知社會上所有不良之現象，必皆有其沿革背景與環境，蓋能「恕」方能心氣和平而有探討其癥結之餘地。否則必悲傷抑諺而於事無補，或自甘暴棄而同流合污，皆不足取。</p>
<p>第三階段日「勸」。經上兩階段之鍛鍊，則已漸臻「知己知彼」之境，然後不言則已言必有中。「敬」所以增加立言之影響，「恕」所以增加立言之內容，「勸」所以收立言之效果而達移風易俗之目的。</p>
<p>大學畢業生固須自重而免為人所輕視，尤須能處惡濁之社會而革之於無形，須知有創造新社會志願與能力之大學畢業生，方有發揮共專門技術之機會。否則隨波逐流中無所主，縱有滿腹經綸，不久亦將被社會之驚濤駭浪捲入深淵，可悲也矣！大學應届畢業生共勉旃！</p>

<p>盟邦日本對於糧食增產，極為重視，過去屢就農業技術改進作成增產方案。茲更決定增產及供出量之獎勵特別措置，對於農民供出量增加以後之獎勵方法，合理規定。頗足為我國當前籌議增產計劃時之參考。爰將日本獎勵糧食增產之內容，邊譯於后，以資借鏡：</p>
<p>日本政府於四月二十八日閣議中討論「關於獎勵米穀之增產及供出之恃別措置」案，由內田農商相加以說明後</p>
<p>關於獎勵米毅之增產及供出之特別措置（情報局發表）：</p>
<p>方針</p>
<p>鑑於大東亞戰爭現階段中確保食糧的重要性，爲更昻揚農家對米穀生產及供出之決心，並勵行消費節約，採用副食品起見，關於供米的定額，在佈種前即加決定，並對供米超過一定量者，採報獎的措置，以謀充足食糧供求計劃上的需要量。</p>
<p>要領</p>
<p>一，種稻前依下列規定供米定額：</p>
<p>（1）關於供米定額量，以確保食糧供求計劃上必要之數量為前提，考慮昭和十八年度產米的實收額上土地改良事業的効果及肥料等，積極，消極二方面的情形，而推定本年的全國生產額。又關於農家的自用米，鑒於目前的情形，在不超過現在自身保有米數量之範圍內，算定修正數量。又以前政府所不收買的釀酒用米及稻種等，原則上亦由政府收買，以謀運輸及配給的計劃化。</p>
<p>（2）供米定額之單位，仍如前以部落為單位，使部落內各戶負共同責任供出。</p>
<p>定額之順序爲政府對都道縣府，都道縣府對市鎭村，市鎭村對部落，各各規定其供米量的定額。</p>
<p>（3）最初之定額量以國家供求計劃上之需要量為基礎。農家應增產米以外之副食品，自行籌措食糧。故在事前即規定定額，促使農家覺悟，一旦規定以後，即不能减額。但在下列二種情形下，實因不得已原因而經一定手續者，得准其减額。</p>
<p>甲，因特殊災害而而大量滅收時。</p>
<p>乙，因轉換爲工廠廠基等不得已事由，相當面積的耕地供其他用途時。</p>
<p>二，地方長官對市鎮村，市鎮村長對部落，規定各該定額時，應得都道府縣農業會，市鎭村農業會的協力，以期盡善。</p>
<p>至部落內各戶的分攤量，以區長或實行組合長為中心，經部落商談後決定，以期增產之確保，定額之均衡。上述市鎮村對部落，及部落內各戶分擬量之決定，最重要者須定額均衡，故地方長官應嚴予監</p>
<p>三，以前的供米，從生產額中減去自身的保有米即為供出量：但自以國家的需要量為責任數量，一經規定，非供出不可之後，上面的觀念變更了。即供米滿了定額之後，就沒有供出更多的米的義務，剩下的米，或由農家保存，或自行消費，一任自由。換言之，增產的時候，餘剩下來的。剩在農家。但要賣出時，非出賣於政府不可。且鑒於目前的國情，並此次的報獎措置，希望在可能範圍內儘量供給政府。又由於上述的結果，去年以來徑認可的特別管理米制度，自然廢止</p>
<p>發給獎金辦法</p>
<p>四，關於供米，政府依下列規定對部落給付獎勵金及報獎金。但關於不在村地主之供出米，則不交付。</p>
<p>1獎勵金—因許多不良條件，尤其在肥料情形惡化的不得已情勢下，維持生產不是件容易的事，即欲維持常年的狀態，農家亦須付出倍於以前的苦心與努力。沒有自給肥料，而欲維持增產是很困難的。因而對供米在定額以上者，因其為農家努力的結果，故給付獎勵金如次：</p>
<p>甲，部落內生產者及地主的供米總量，對各該部落的供米定額超過九〇％時，在百％範國內者，其超過部分生產者每石付給獎勵金四十圓，地主每石付給獎勵金十五圓。</p>
<p>乙，因特別災害而減收的都落，核滅其供出定額時，各該部落內之生產者及地主之供米總量，超過改訂量九〇％而在百％以內者，對其超過部分每石付給生產者獎勵金四十圓，地主十五圓。</p>
<p>丙，上面付給之獎勵金，視部落內的生產者及在村地主之超過額而按分分配之。</p>
<p>2報獎金　依供米定額供出，殊為困難，但如由於非常的努力，不僅稻作有增產的餘地，即在消費方面亦可節約，而可供出比定額更多之數量。這在目前是非常希望共同努力的。因此，對超過定額百％以上者，依下列付給報獎金：</p>
<p>甲，部落內的生產者及地主的供出總量超過各該部落最初的定額百％時，對其超過部分每石付給生產者報獎金百圓，地主七十五圓。但因特別災害而減收者，核減其最初供出定額時，雖付給前述獎勵金，但不付給報獎金。</p>
<p>乙，報獎金之部落內的措置，與獎勵金同，部落內生產者及在村地主各按其超額分配。</p>
<p>五，都道府縣超過供出定額時，以其一部保管於各該都道府縣內，必要時機地方長官之申請，得作應急之用，以報地方畏官之努力。</p>
<p>六，關於米麥之增產及供出有特別功續者，由農商大臣授賞。（翔：譯日四月二十九日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c47">華中鐵道　調整行車時該　本月十五日起實施 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>華中鐵道公司，為强化輸送重要物資，及處理大量旅客，按照華北滿鮮等鐵路之時刻改正，訂於本月十五日起將原有之京滬滬杭京蕪等各綫行車時間，全部加以調整改訂，此外對於京滬綫快車由滬至蘇州一段，除有公務之軍政官吏外，嚴禁普通乘客，此舉可便利由滬至京之旅客非淺。華鐵方面特將京常間之區間車，予以廢止，改駛於滬常間之區間車。茲將各綫改訂時間分誌如次：</p>
<p>更改時刻</p>
<p>（京滬綫）京滬綫由滬至京快車時間，原爲上午九時，現提早半小時改為八時半，由滬啓行，下午二時三十分抵京。午後之快車，仍為下午四時，惟至晚間十時抵京，較原有時刻延長四十分鐘。由京至滬上下午快車與由滬啓行時間相同。其次普通車行駛時間，由滬至京啓行為上午九時三十分開，下午六時三十分到，下午十時五十分開，翌晨七時三十分到，而由京至滬時間為上午九時五十分開，下午七時二十五分到。下午十時五十分開，翌晨七時五十分到。（滬杭錢）由　開杭之快車時閒，原為上午十時，由滬開出，現亦提早半小時改為九時三十分啓行，下午二時十分抵杭。由杭至滬快直時間，改為下午三時五十分駛行，　將原有時間遲發半小時，下午八時二十五分抵滬。次如由杭至滬普通車時間為上午八時另五分開，下午二時另五分到，下午四時三十分開，至下午十時二十五分到，在滬杭綫由滬往杭時間延長五十分，由杭往滬時間則延長一時二十分，着通上下車則因中途停留關係，概延長一小時。（京蕪綫）由京至蕪湖問之往復各軍，均約延畏五十分。</p>
<p>調整車輛</p>
<p>此次華鐵方面爲增加輸送能力及避免旅客擁擠起見，自十五日起特將京滬綫之膳直廢止，並增加二等車一輛行駛，此外為便利遠途旅客搭乘快車，限止由滬赴崑山蘇州之旅客搭乘快車，祗可利用普通車。惟負有公務之軍人軍屬及官吏除外，並禁止在崑蘇兩地普通旅客下車，否則不但將所持車票及快車票概作無效外，並追罰該乘車地間之車票價與快車票價之十倍。此外為樂於該段旅客在交通上之激增，以資調整起見，特將往復於南京常州間之區間車予以廢止，特改行於上海常州間之行駛，關於吳淞綫之車行次數，並不更改，但因由於學生上學及職工服務之便利，計有若干時刻稍加修正。今次為應付戰時體制下之需要及强化輸送力量起見，華鐵公司之變更調整措置，冀盼一般旅客，予以深切瞭解及協力。</p>

<p>實業部為是進上海市方面物個管理進一步嚴密起見，特會同上海市政府積極籌組上海市物價對策委員會，其成立以後之任務在於綜合各有關方面人士。對物價採取共同聯絡，計劃管理督導等工作，俾使上海市物價趨於正軌。無疑地，這一措施，又是上海物價前途的一個福音。</p>
<p>物價與上民生是齒唇相依的，尤其是在戰時物資缺乏，民生凋敵之秋，物價不特影響民生，抑且影響民心，其在戰時各種經濟施策中，目然要算是具有第一重要性了。可是，自來戰時物價的管理最難，而在專事追求利潤，無孔不人，積習難返的上海，物價之管理尤難。如今，既能決定嚴密管理上海物價，那末，第一，須先澈底明瞭一切足以造成今日高物價之原因；第二，須根據研究所得的一切原因，講求對策，對症下藥。譬如，以物價高漲的原因而言，我們都知道米價是凡百物價的領導者，那末，我們就得詳研米價何以終於不能下跌的原因，又如，以物價管理對策而言，我們都知道經濟保安處之設置，是執行物價對策的一個有效工具，可是，除此而外，有沒有什麼其他強有力的管理上海物價對策？從今而後，我們深切期待其一一分曉於我們的眼前。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄言　洪洋譯</p>
<p>思索了一個整夜，而未能入難，結果，隆夫就決定去訪巿來德次郞，請示終身大計，他旣有鹿兒島人的血，當然會帮忙的。請同鄕關照，這是鹿兒島人一向的作風，縱令沒到隆夫這樣走頭無路時，也是這樣作的。</p>
<p>市來氏的家，是比洗足池更遠的地方，然而因為是琉璃瓦的屋頂，很遠就可以淸楚的看見，所以毫不費事，就找到了。</p>
<p>「俺是鹿兒島人，姓牟田口，多請關照……」。</p>
<p>多時未見到一個同鄕，此時旣看到，所以隆夫又晚口而出許多土話。傳達的女傭人，忍着笑，跑到裏面去了。</p>
<p>過了片刻，隆夫就被引到別有風味，而陳列着無數裝飾品的客廳裏去。正在想着中國和南洋的花瓶時，而又看到農家使用的古來伸縮自如的鎖鏈</p>
<p>等了很久，才出來一位穿着和服的男人。眞是出乎意外的矮小，嘴巴上長着鬍鬚，而眼珠裏，表現出十分文雅來。</p>
<p>「好吧，你坐下吧！」</p>
<p>隆夫按着家鄕對長輩的態度，曾表示着最大的禮節，而不肯在長輩面前坐着，但市來氏總是不答應他這樣作。隆夫，終於侷促不安地坐在椅子上了。</p>
<p>「俺也是已經二十年沒回鹿兒島了。那種老人的　傲和自命不凡，眞呌俺討壓萬分。」</p>
<p>市來畫家的話語裏，也琉露着不少家鄉的土話。以脆快的聲調，並不繁文縟禮地，開始說鹿樣同鄕人，幾令他感到異樣。</p>
<p>「呵，原來你也是二中的學生。他媽的，世界上就沒有那樣野蠻的中學。</p>
<p>隆夫一聽到這樣話，就逐漸心坎裏忐忑跳起來。他只是因市來氏是同鄕長輩，而來請求指導的，然而覺着如依　此人，恐有些不妥當。</p>
<p>「可是，你為了什麽來的？」</p>
<p>隆夫因在哭喪着臉，而在沉默着，所以畫家就這樣問了一句。隆夫在心裏盤算了一下，而就决定一五一十地吿訴了他。然而，只是把出走的事沒有說。</p>
<p>「畫家並不是容易當的呀！縱有好的夭才，也需要十年功夫。」</p>
<p>「需要那樣久麽？」</p>
<p>「最好，現在就死心塌地，放棄當畫家的志願吧！」</p>
<p>「不，那怎麽能行？」</p>
<p>隆夫用力地反抗了一句。畫家就嗤嗤地笑起來，於是說：</p>
<p>「旣然有這樣大的决心，就學一學看。但我收徒弟是討厭的。你如果願意在我家當書童的話，就到我家來吧！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement to University Graduates <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Time flies, and the summer vacation is approaching. University graduates are preparing to leave school and enter society. Those who have received higher education have always been a minority among the entire population of China. During these difficult times, it is even more important to realize how rare and valuable it is to complete a university education. University graduates all have specialized knowledge, and various sectors of society are eager for specialists to participate and apply their skills. Seeing a batch of "new recruits" arriving, who wouldn't be filled with joy and anticipation? However, based on past experience, a large number of university graduates enter society from school every year, but the effects and achievements society obtains often fall short of expectations. Over time, this can lead to a lack of importance placed on university graduates, which is something university graduates themselves should reflect on. The teaching situation and standards of graduates at the university level certainly have a decisive impact on whether they are valued or not, but that will not be discussed in detail here. On the other hand, a lack of deep understanding of how to conduct oneself in the world is also one of the important reasons. Social situations are extremely complex, especially in recent times, which have been called a "den of all evils." To use generalizing terms to indicate the compass for navigating the world is truly worrying and difficult, but we are willing to offer some humble opinions and advise university graduates.</p>
<p>Schools are essentially a microcosm of society, and university students are mostly adults and have some contact with social content. However, the scope of the school is ultimately simple, and there will inevitably be some separation when one first enters society. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue a systematic way of conducting oneself and exert the power of youth. This can be discussed in three stages:</p>
<p>The first stage is called "Respect." Before leaving school, university students often express their lofty ideals by criticizing society, but often they are "groaning without illness" or "scratching an itch through boots." This habit must be changed as soon as possible, and one should approach everything with an attitude of "respect." With one's own conscience and abilities, interact with society with sincerity, so as to lay the foundation for oneself. Otherwise, one will either choose to escape from the world and isolate oneself from society, or one will become recklessly self-deprecating and willing to assimilate into society. Although madness and stupidity are different, they both cut off their own future. It must be understood that no matter how dark society is, there are always one or two points of light shining within it. If an individual can discipline themselves with "respect" and maintain their vitality, they will increase a bit of light. Things gather by type. From this, most of the one or two points can gradually accumulate and shine brightly.</p>
<p>The second stage is called "Tolerance." After being in society for a long time, the true shortcomings and evils of society will gradually be exposed before us. Those who can discipline themselves with "respect" will see more clearly, and even the smallest details cannot escape their notice. At this point, one must first treat them with "tolerance." "Tolerance" does not mean compromise. It must be understood that all the negative phenomena in society must have their own historical background and environment. Only by being "tolerant" can one have a peaceful mind and have room to explore the root causes. Otherwise, one will inevitably be sad and depressed and of no help, or one will abandon oneself and go along with the tide, all of which are undesirable.</p>
<p>The third stage is called "Persuasion." After the training of the above two stages, one will gradually reach the state of "knowing oneself and knowing the other." Then, when one speaks, one will hit the mark. "Respect" is used to increase the influence of one's words, "Tolerance" is used to increase the content of one's words, and "Persuasion" is used to achieve the effect of one's words and achieve the goal of changing customs and habits.</p>
<p>University graduates must respect themselves and avoid being looked down upon. In particular, they must be able to live in a corrupt society and reform it invisibly. It must be understood that only university graduates with the ambition and ability to create a new society have the opportunity to apply their specialized skills. Otherwise, in the midst of following the crowd without any principle, even if one has a wealth of knowledge, one will soon be swept into the abyss by the shocking waves of society. How sad! University graduates, let us encourage each other!</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) British Air Force Undersecretary Balfour had made the bold statement that the European landing operation had already begun due to the activity of the anti-Axis air force. The main points of his statement are recorded below: Due to the start of this army action, the second front has entered a new phase. Because the first operation was started by the anti-Axis air force, such as the recent participation of 8,500 soldiers in the attack on Berlin, and considering the fact that 7,500 soldiers participated in attacks in various places in mid-April, it is generally recognized by the world that a major attack on Europe will be launched in the near future. At the same time as the British army launches operations on the European continent, it will first inflict a fatal blow on the enemy army with 138,000 air force soldiers, and then calmly launch an attack, which is not a problem at all.</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports: It was announced today that German and Romanian forces withdrew from Sevastopol, now a ruined city, last night. The rear guard of the German and Romanian forces has retreated to the western end of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to frontline news: The great battle for the Sevastopol fortress has reached its fiercest point, with the entire area shrouded in flames and smoke. German and Romanian forces in the city are putting up a determined resistance against the wave-like attacks of the Soviet army, under the cover of air force and artillery. The Soviet Information Bureau reported on the night of the 9th that the Soviet army had captured the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters reports: Both sides are preparing for the Soviet summer offensive. The measures taken in March to increase military strength in the southeastern sector of the Eastern Front will become more effective in the coming weeks. The German side is closely monitoring the movements of the Soviet forces concentrated in various sectors, and there is little chance of a surprise victory. Based on reconnaissance reports, we have taken the necessary defensive measures. The passes of Lviv and the Carpathian Mountains, and the penetration into the Romanian plains, seem to be the targets of the Soviet forces in the southern sector. Therefore, Sevastopol is no longer as strategically important for German and Romanian defenses as it once was, but the German forces in that sector have not abandoned their strategy of strong resistance.</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters reports: German fighter groups heavily bombed enemy rear supply centers, greatly disrupting the Soviet army's preparations for a new offensive. The roads in southern Ukraine are still muddy and inconvenient for traffic, forcing the Soviet army to use the railway as the main means of transportation, but it is also being heavily bombed by German aircraft. When the rails are damaged, German aircraft return to destroy them before Soviet engineers can finish repairing them. Every day, German reconnaissance aircraft identify enemy mounds or train concentration areas, and large bomber formations attack them at night. Last night, the main target of the attack was the train yard in the Kyiv area. The moonlight was bright as a picture, and the bombs did not miss their targets. Thousands of bombs and incendiary bombs exploded and burned one after another within half an hour, destroying many freight cars. One section of a train carrying military supplies exploded, with flames soaring into the sky. In addition to heavily bombing the enemy's rear, German aircraft also attacked enemy forces on the front lines. Soviet military supplies suffered heavy losses before they even reached the front lines.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Measures to Encourage Increased Rice Production and Supply: Japanese Government Stipulates Special Measures <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Allied nation of Japan attaches great importance to increasing food production, and has repeatedly formulated increased production plans based on agricultural technology improvements. Now, it has decided on special measures to reward increased production and supply volume, and reasonably stipulate the methods of rewarding farmers for increasing supply volume. This is very worthy of reference for our country's current deliberations on increased production plans. Therefore, the contents of Japan's incentives for increased grain production are translated below for reference:</p>
<p>The Japanese government discussed the "Special Measures Regarding Incentives for Increased Rice Production and Supply" proposal at a cabinet meeting on April 28. Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Uchida explained the proposal.</p>
<p>Special Measures Regarding Incentives for Increased Rice Production and Supply (Information Bureau announcement):</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>In view of the importance of securing food supplies in the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, in order to further enhance farmers' determination to produce and supply rice, and to encourage frugality in consumption and the adoption of supplementary foods, the quota for rice supply will be determined before planting. Incentive measures will be adopted for those who supply more than a certain amount, in order to meet the needs of the food supply and demand plan.</p>
<p>Main Points</p>
<p>1. The rice supply quota will be determined before planting according to the following regulations:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the amount of the rice supply quota, it will be determined based on the premise of ensuring the necessary quantity for the food supply and demand plan, and taking into account the actual harvest amount of rice in 1943, the effects of land improvement projects, and the positive and negative aspects of fertilizers, etc., to estimate the national production amount for this year. Furthermore, regarding farmers' self-use rice, in light of the current situation, the revised quantity will be calculated within the scope of not exceeding the current amount of rice they possess. In addition, rice for brewing and rice seeds, which were not previously purchased by the government, will also be purchased by the government in principle, in order to plan for transportation and distribution.</p>
<p>(2) The unit of the rice supply quota will still be the village, as before, so that each household in the village bears joint responsibility for supply.</p>
<p>The order of quotas is: the government sets the quota for the prefectures, the prefectures set the quota for the cities, towns, and villages, and the cities, towns, and villages set the quota for the villages.</p>
<p>(3) The initial quota amount is based on the needs of the national supply and demand plan. Farmers should grow supplementary foods other than rice and procure food for themselves. Therefore, the quota will be set in advance to make farmers aware that once it is set, it cannot be reduced. However, in the following two situations, the quota may be reduced with approval through a certain procedure due to unavoidable reasons:</p>
<p>A. When there is a large-scale crop failure due to a special disaster.</p>
<p>B. When a considerable area of arable land is used for other purposes due to unavoidable reasons such as conversion to factory sites.</p>
<p>2. When local officials set the quota for cities, towns, and villages, and when city, town, and village chiefs set the quota for villages, they should obtain the cooperation of the prefectural and municipal agricultural associations in order to achieve the best results.</p>
<p>The allocation amount for each household within the village will be determined by the village chief or the head of the implementation association after consultation with the village, in order to ensure increased production and quota balance. When determining the allocation amount for the village by the city, town, and village, and for each household within the village, the most important thing is to ensure quota balance. Therefore, local officials should strictly supervise.</p>
<p>3. In the past, the rice supply amount was the amount of production minus the self-possession rice. However, since the amount required by the country is the responsibility quantity, once it is set, it is not possible to not supply it, and the above concept has changed. That is, after the rice supply meets the quota, there is no obligation to supply more rice. The remaining rice can be stored by the farmers or consumed by themselves, as they see fit. In other words, when production increases, the surplus remains with the farmers. However, when it is sold, it must be sold to the government. And in view of the current national situation and the incentive measures this time, it is hoped that the government will be supplied as much as possible within the possible range. Also, due to the above results, the special management rice system that has been recognized since last year will naturally be abolished.</p>
<p>Method of Issuing Bonuses</p>
<p>4. Regarding rice supply, the government will pay incentives and bonuses to the village according to the following regulations. However, no payment will be made for the rice supplied by absentee landlords.</p>
<p>1 Incentive Money - Due to many unfavorable conditions, especially in the unavoidable situation of fertilizer deterioration, it is not easy to maintain production. Even to maintain the annual state, farmers have to pay twice the previous effort and effort. Without self-sufficient fertilizer, it is difficult to maintain increased production. Therefore, incentives are paid for those who supply rice above the quota, because it is the result of farmers' efforts.</p>
<p>A. When the total amount of rice supplied by producers and landowners in the village exceeds 90% of the rice quota for each village, within the 100% range, the producer will be given an incentive of 40 yen per koku (approx. 5 bushels) for the excess, and the landowner will be given an incentive of 15 yen per koku.</p>
<p>B. When the quota for villages that have suffered a reduction in yield due to special disasters is revised, if the total amount of rice supplied by the producers and landowners in each village exceeds 90% of the revised amount but is within 100%, the producer will be given an incentive of 40 yen per koku for the excess, and the landowner will be given 15 yen.</p>
<p>C. The incentive money paid above will be distributed proportionally according to the amount of surplus from producers and landowners in the village.</p>
<p>2 Bonus Money - It is extremely difficult to supply rice according to the quota, but if, through extraordinary efforts, not only is there room for increased rice production, but also savings can be made in consumption, a quantity greater than the quota can be supplied. This is something we all hope to work together on at present. Therefore, bonuses will be paid according to the following for those who exceed 100% of the quota:</p>
<p>A. When the total amount of rice supplied by producers and landowners in the village exceeds 100% of the initial quota for each village, the producer will be given a bonus of 100 yen per koku for the excess, and the landowner will be given 75 yen. However, villages that have suffered a reduction in yield due to special disasters will not be paid a bonus even if they are paid the aforementioned incentive money when their initial supply quota is reduced.</p>
<p>B. The measures for bonus money in the village are the same as for incentive money. Producers and landowners in the village will each distribute the excess amount according to their surplus.</p>
<p>5. When the prefecture exceeds the supply quota, part of it will be kept within the prefecture. If necessary, the application of the local governor can be used for emergency purposes to reward the efforts of local officials.</p>
<p>6. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will award those who have made special contributions to the increase in rice and wheat production and supply. (Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News, April 29)</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the transportation of important materials and handle a large number of passengers, Central China Railway Company, in accordance with the timetable revisions of railways such as North China and Manchukuo, has ordered that the train times for the existing Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Beijing-Wuhu lines be completely adjusted and revised from the 15th of this month. In addition, for the Beijing-Shanghai line express train from Shanghai to Suzhou, in addition to military and government officials on official business, ordinary passengers are strictly prohibited. This move can facilitate passengers traveling from Shanghai to Beijing. Central China Railway has specially abolished the local train between Beijing and Changzhou and changed it to a local train between Shanghai and Changzhou. The revised times for each line are listed below:</p>
<p>Change Timetable</p>
<p>(Beijing-Shanghai Line) The express train time from Shanghai to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai line was originally 9:00 AM, but now it is moved forward by half an hour to 8:30 AM, departing from Shanghai and arriving in Beijing at 2:30 PM. The afternoon express train is still at 4:00 PM, but arrives in Beijing at 10:00 PM, extending the original time by 40 minutes. The departure times of the express trains from Beijing to Shanghai are the same as those departing from Shanghai. Secondly, the operating time of ordinary trains is 9:30 AM from Shanghai to Beijing, arriving at 6:30 PM, departing at 10:50 PM, and arriving at 7:30 AM the next morning. The time from Beijing to Shanghai is 9:50 AM, arriving at 7:25 PM, departing at 10:50 PM, and arriving at 7:50 AM the next morning.

The express trains are extended by one hour due to the intermediate stops. (Beijing-Wuhu Line) The round trips between Beijing and Wuhu have been extended by approximately 50 minutes each.</p>
<p>Adjusting Vehicles</p>
<p>In order to increase transportation capacity and avoid passenger congestion, the Central China Railway Company will abolish the dining cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line from the 15th and increase the number of second-class cars. In addition, in order to facilitate long-distance passengers to take express trains, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Kunshan and Suzhou are restricted from taking express trains and can only use ordinary trains. However, military personnel, military dependents, and officials on official business are exempt. In addition, it is forbidden for ordinary passengers to get off the train in Kunshan and Suzhou, otherwise not only will the tickets and express tickets held be invalidated, but also ten times the ticket price and express ticket price for the ride between those places will be charged. In addition, in order to adjust the sharp increase in traffic in that section, the local train traveling between Nanjing and Changzhou has been abolished and specially changed to travel between Shanghai and Changzhou. The number of train trips on the Wusong line will not be changed, but some times have been slightly revised for the convenience of students going to school and workers going to work.

<p>Xinhe Yarn Factory Increases Capital: The face value of Xinhe Yarn Factory's capital increase shares was fully paid up on the 8th of last month. The premium share balance has also been underwritten and paid up by a certain syndicate. According to the shareholders' meeting on March 9th, the syndicate was willing to purchase all the premium shares, but later, the old shareholders believed that the asset value of each new share was above 90 yuan, while the premium was only 45 yuan as set by the market, which they felt was a loss of rights, so it was changed to be subscribed for by the old shareholders, with a two-month extension, while the syndicate changed to underwriting the remaining balance. An agreement was already in place. Now that the deadline for payment by the old shareholders has passed, the syndicate is still fulfilling its promise to realize the long-term investment plan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Economic Commentary: Managing Shanghai Prices <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>In order to further tighten the management of commodity prices in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government, is actively preparing to establish the Shanghai Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee. Its task after its establishment will be to integrate individuals from various relevant fields to adopt joint communication, planning, management, supervision and other work on commodity prices, so that Shanghai commodity prices will be on the right track. Undoubtedly, this measure is another piece of good news for the future of Shanghai's commodity prices.</p>
<p>Commodity prices and people's livelihood are closely related, especially in times of war when resources are scarce and people's livelihood is declining. Commodity prices not only affect people's livelihood, but also affect public sentiment. Among the various economic measures taken during wartime, this is naturally the most important. However, the management of commodity prices during wartime has always been the most difficult, and in Shanghai, where people are solely pursuing profits, where there are no loopholes, and where deeply ingrained habits are difficult to change, the management of commodity prices is even more difficult. Now that the decision has been made to strictly manage Shanghai's commodity prices, then, first, we must thoroughly understand all the reasons that have caused today's high commodity prices; second, we must, based on all the reasons obtained from research, seek countermeasures and prescribe the right medicine. For example, as far as the reasons for rising commodity prices are concerned, we all know that rice prices are the leader of all commodity prices, so we must study in detail why rice prices ultimately cannot fall. Also, as far as commodity price management countermeasures are concerned, we all know that the establishment of the Economic Security Office is an effective tool for implementing commodity price countermeasures, but apart from this, are there any other powerful countermeasures for managing Shanghai's commodity prices? From now on, we deeply expect to see each of them clarified before our eyes.</p>

<p>The championship final of the Shanghai Open Basketball Grade A Tournament, Zhongbei vs. Renyu, was held last night at the Zhongqing Basketball Stadium, with an unprecedented turnout. Because the ticket revenue was donated to the newspaper's aid-to-education fund, the audience braved the rain and came even more enthusiastically. The basketball stadium announced that it was full. The game was played in an extremely tense atmosphere. Zhongbei defeated Renyu by a narrow margin of one point, 36-35, winning the championship. In the first half, Zhongbei also led by one point, 15-14. Both sides put on an exceptionally exciting performance.</p>

<p>During the halftime break of the game, the charity basketball was auctioned off by President Chen of this newspaper. Enthusiastic aid-to-education supporters competed to bid, raising the price from 5,000 yuan to 10,000, 20,000, and then over 100,000. The auction was won by Gongji with the highest bid of 150,000 yuan for the charity basketball. His enthusiasm for helping education is truly admirable. At the same time, this newspaper decided to present both teams with souvenirs in appreciation of their enthusiastic support.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Game Was Tense and Exciting From Beginning to End <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Last night's game was decided by experience on the court. Renyu failed to seize the victory in the last five minutes, allowing Zhongbei to come from behind, which was the key to the victory. The game was tense throughout, with the score difference between the two teams constantly fluctuating between one and two points, and there were countless ties. Renyu had eleven free throw opportunities, but only scored five points, which was the reason for their defeat. Zhongbei scored four points on free throws. Zhongbei performed more loosely last night, and Shen Dangong's brilliant shooting repeatedly created the victory. Renyu's rising star Lin Weicong also repeatedly scored with brilliant shots. Li Zhenzhong and Zhuo Chunrong were the two mainstays of the defense for both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Zhongbei Wins by One Point <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Both sides lined up their formations. Zhongbei started with the five tigers of Li Zhenzhong, Li Baozhong, Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and Xu Zhaoxiong. Renyu countered with Zhuo Tuanrong, Ma Canxi, Li Shenghe, Yu Xunzi, and Lin Weicong. Li Juhe committed a foul, and Chen Xuechong scored the first point on a free throw, opening the scoring. Renyu's Lin Weicong scored from long range, taking the lead 2-1. Thereafter, the situation between the two sides formed a tug-of-war, rising and falling, always within a word. Zhongbei's Shen Yugong and Renyu's Lin Weicong were the main scorers for both teams. The result of the first half was 15-14, with Zhongbei leading by one point. In the second half, Renyu tied the score at 19, and the situation suddenly unfolded. Renyu's generals scored consecutive brilliant shots, suddenly creating a huge lead of 32-23. Unfortunately, it was only temporary. At this critical juncture, Zhongbei's Shen Yugong, Li Zhenzhong, and others desperately chased after the score, tying it again at 32. Xiao Lin scored a point, giving Renyu the lead. Shen Yugong immediately showed his skill, tying the score again at 34-34. Yu Xunzi scored, giving Renyu one more point. Shen Yugong's final throw resulted in a score of 36-35, giving Zhongbei the final victory.</p>

<p>— by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>After a sleepless night of pondering, Longfu decided to visit Mr. Shiraide Jiro to seek advice on his life plan. Since he had the blood of a Kagoshima native, he would surely help. Seeking assistance from fellow villagers was the usual practice for the people of Kagoshima, even when they were not as desperate as Longfu.</p>
<p>The Shiraide residence was further than the location of the Washing Feet Pond, but because of its glass tiled roof, it could be clearly seen from afar, so it was easy to find.</p>
<p>"I am Mutaguchi from Kagoshima, please take care of me..."</p>
<p>Having not seen a fellow villager for a long time, Longfu blurted out many local dialects. The maid, suppressing a smile, ran inside.</p>
<p>After a while, Longfu was led into a uniquely decorated living room filled with countless decorations. As he was admiring the Chinese and Nanyang vases, he noticed the ancient expandable chains used in farming.</p>
<p>After waiting a long time, a man in a kimono appeared. He was unexpectedly short, with a mustache, and his eyes conveyed great refinement.</p>
<p>"Okay, sit down!"</p>
<p>Following the tradition of his hometown, Longfu showed the greatest respect to his elders and refused to sit in front of them, but Mr. Shiraide kept refusing to allow it. Longfu finally sat uncomfortably on the chair.</p>
<p>"I haven't been back to Kagoshima in twenty years. I really hate the arrogance and self-importance of those old people."</p>
<p>Mr. Shiraide's words also revealed many local dialects. He started talking about the villagers of Kagoshima in a crisp tone, without formalities, which made Longfu feel strange.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you are also a student of the Second Middle School. Damn it, there is no such barbaric middle school in the world."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Longfu's heart gradually began to beat faster. He had only come to seek guidance because Mr. Shiraide was an elder from his hometown, but he felt that relying on this person might not be appropriate.</p>
<p>"But what did you come for?"</p>
<p>Because Longfu was looking gloomy and silent, the painter asked. Longfu thought for a moment and decided to tell him everything. However, he didn't mention the fact that he had run away.</p>
<p>"Being a painter is not easy! Even with good talent, it takes ten years of effort."</p>
<p>"Does it take that long?"</p>
<p>"It's best to give up your ambition to be a painter right now!"</p>
<p>"No, how can I do that?"</p>
<p>Longfu strongly protested. The painter chuckled and said:</p>
<p>"Since you have such great determination, then study and see. But I hate taking on disciples. If you are willing to be a servant in my house, then come to my house!"</p>

Each box contains eight dozen and is sold for 700 yuan. The profits, after a portion is distributed as dividends to commercial shareholders, will be used to fund relief for the unemployed and suffering children.</p>
<p>Keys Awaiting Collection: On the morning of the 5th of this month, at around 8:00 AM, I found a bunch of keys on the ground at the intersection of Datong Road and Cixi Road.
