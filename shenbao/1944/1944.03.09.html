<h3 id="c1">物價問題的核心 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東京朝日新聞，二月二十五日社許，題為「中國物價問題的核心」（譯文見今日本報本版）論列要點，頗與我們向所張的相同。盟邦輿論對於中國物價問題關心，觀察的深刻與見解的透澈，誠使我們深為感佩。</p>
<p>朝日新聞說：「物價問題巳發展為深刻的政治問題，不能作為經濟問題而解決了。」又說：「問題的重心，已轉移到政治上，而希望國府首先刷新政治，以為強化政治力的前提」。這種見解，確已抓住了中國物價問題的核心。我們對於物價問題曾經說過：「經濟措施單獨的力量，不足以挽救危機，必先革新政治，使政治力　與經濟措施相配合。」可謂所見正同。</p>
<p>朝日新聞又說：「會議儘管不厭煩瑣的屢次召開，但如不下決心實行其決議，對於問題的解決，亳無所用。因此，不免有人非難國府缺乏强行物價對策的熱忱。」我們會在二月廿二日社訊中，特別指出，「過去對於抑平物價工作，已為朝野一致重視，管理物價之機構，調整物價之辦法，不可謂不完備，不周密。可是，事實昭示，未能適如預料者，其癥結實在於「執行不力」，「執行不當」。「執行不力」與「執行不當」，就是「不下決心實行會議的決議」，當然，對於物價問題的解決，是毫無所用了，不過，「革新政治，不是一九即幾的，非下決心，建立好人政府不可。而目前抑平物價急切的洽標辦法，我們始終認為非實施下列兩點不為功：</p>
<p>第一，民生日用必需品，必須設法予以最低限度的供給。尤以每日生活所資的米與煤兩項最為重要。無論根據理論或過去的實際經驗，每次物價的劇烈波動，總是米或煤發生領導作用。而米與煤所以成嚴重問題者，客觀上並不在於缺乏，就海而言，目前為止，因為缺米缺煤而坐以待斃者，尙無所聞。况且上海是都市，身原非產米產煤地區，尙不缺乏。那末，實際上既不缺乏，而節節暴　的原因何在呢？就是因為有黑市有走私，所以，我們主張，消滅黑市，代以公價，取締走私，代以公運。不過，黑市的消滅，如用强制方法，則不但不能收效，且將益發居奇。唯有增加配給數量，維持最低需要，無所求於黑市，則黑市不滅而自消。譬如說，戶口米現在配給每人每月六升，而最低需要每人每月平均一斗五升，所差九升，除戶口粉彌補外，均求之黑市。黑市就很自然的存在，既稱黑市，就極可能不規則的暴盪了。</p>
<p>第二，除米與煤以外的民生日用品，大都為工業製品，如果要求供給不絕，則生產不斷自為唯一條件，而要求生產不斷，則工業原料與動力尤屬必不可少。如果原料取給困難，動力又予限制，即維持原狀已是難事，遑論增加生產了。</p>
<p>第三，直接間接與物價有關之管理或紡制機關，在系統職權上必須一元化，絕對避免重床疊架，因為駢枝太多，不但虛麋公帑，且辦事牽制，結果治絲益棼，一事無成。</p>
<p>我們的結論，物價問題的核心，在於革新政治，發揮政治力量，配合經濟措施，才能澈底挽救危機。目前急切的治標方法，在於增加米與煤的配給量，逐漸接近最低需要。對於日用必需工業襲品，至少應供給原料與動力，使維持原有生產程度。同時，管理機關的職權必須一元化，以收分工介作之效。且三者不可偏廢，缺一即足以影響全盤。</p>

<p>東京八日中央社電緬甸日軍某基地訊：緬甸方面日　軍機隊與地上部隊協力，會於六日正午邀擊潛入仰光附近上空之敵機三架，結果共擊落其二架，其餘一架遁逃，日軍無損害。</p>

<p>英第七師某中尉談</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電印緬邊境日軍，於辛澤瓦盆地將英軍第七師殲滅時，曾俘虜大批英軍，茲據被俘之英軍第七師某中尉談其詳情稱：英軍第七師於北非作戰完畢後，即開抵印度，幷混以刻在加爾谷答西方四十公里七蘭克受密林戰訓練之情銳部隊加以改編，若以種族之分別，英兵與廊爾喀兵各佔二成三，塞克兵與旁遮普兵共為五成，師長最初為戈培特中將，改編後，由美　拉比少將擔任。該少將自一九三四年起至一九四○年止，在近東　任旅團長之職，幷曾服務於印軍司令部，實為一猛將，第七師於彼指導之下，與第四師同為印度最精銳之勁旅，前年十月上旬，第七師與第二十六師交替開往前錢，至那凱多克公路開通，即於十月中旬開始集結於辛澤瓦東方，準備作戰。蒙特巴頓司令官對該方面戰局殊為重視，曾於去年十二月七日偕同第十四軍司令及第十五軍團長前往那凱多克視察防務，激勵將士，本年一月八日，又前往前錢訪問第十五軍司令，指示機宜。當時全軍士氣頗佳，師長曾向上方賈獻意見，謂於一月中旬左右開始進攻，最為適宜，但第十六軍長未允，預定二月中旬左右開始進攻，不意日軍先發制人，首先開始進攻，且日軍作戰之勇猛。實出我人意外，現日軍已切　吾之接濟路，余此次首次與日軍作戰，深感臼軍紀嚴肅與戰力優秀，日軍作戰之勇猛，已使棄稱最精銳之第七師潰退。師長以戰况不佳，事先遺棄隊伍遁走，師司令部已為日軍蹂躪，全軍士氣已完全喪失，且印度國民軍與日軍駢肩作戰，影響印兵尤深，印兵巳有動搖之可能，英印軍當局雖千方百計，力謀防止，但余認為遲早將使印兵退出前綫。</p>
<h3 id="c4">華北日軍　獲重大戰果 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>天津八日中央社電華北日軍於本年二月廿二日以來在津　地區從事時　共軍　截止二月　九日，所獲綜合戰果如次：收容渝共軍屍體五九，俘國九五、覆減淪共軍設飾地下壕五一，兵工廠一，鹵慶步槍七五，舟槍彈一○七二，手槍彈一四七，洋砲六○，手溜彈一五七，及其他大批軍用品。</p>
<p>靑島八日中央社電魯省日軍，於二月內，在魯東魯南肅淸渝共軍，所擭綜合戰果如次：交戰次數五二次，渝共軍交戰兵力八○八九人，日軍收容之淪共軍屍體四六二且，俘虜一○九人，覆滅渝共軍設施二，鹵獲步槍一九七，步槍彈一六二一，手槍一○，手溜彈六二，及其他雜品糧秣等極多。</p>

<p>仰光八日中央社電印度民衆之要求釋放政治犯運動，以甘地翁夫人之死於獄中為啓端，頓呈激化，致使印督府極感束手。據四日廣播稱：出席於新德里舉行之印度全國商工會議所聯合大會之多數議員，已向政府提出决議案，要求即時釋放政治犯，且須與彼等以組織聯邦之權限，而力調此為印度期望之和平方策，因此釋放政治犯之運動愈呈激化。</p>

<h3 id="c6">中國物價問題的核心 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>中國的物價，自去歲八月實行收買棉紗棉布以來，雖曾一時平靜，但自十一月左右起，復急遽上昇。糧食·衣料·燃料等主要生活必需品的價格，突飛猛晋，超越當時甚鉅，幾有漲無止境之勢。如棉紗布，去年末已比收買時暴漲約二倍。物價問題可謂已發展為深刻的政治問題，不能作為經濟問題而解决了。</p>
<p>抑制物價的騰貴，保障民生，克服增產的障礙，乃國民政府目前應負的最大政治課題之一。對於此項職責的遂行，國府如缺乏果斷，或出以荀且塞責，則不能不說放棄英自身的使命。</p>
<p>戰時通貨膨脹的現象，不消說，乃因增强生產所致，及物資的不均衡所造成的。但中國最近的物價騰貴，母寗說大多由於敵方所策動，對於中國經濟的復興的悲觀心理的影響，及投極囤積所致。投機囤積的風潮，今日殆已普遍於全國，成為大衆化的風氣。龐大的遊資，傾力搜購物資，因而促進物價之無止境的上漲。</p>
<p>二十二日在上海召開的華中五省一市的物價連絡會議，鑒於最近物價的騰貴，幷非因物資的不足，乃决定今後對於不正當業者從事投機國積，而觸犯經濟法規者，處以嚴刑。解决物價問題的重心，在於取締投機囤積，這不待該會議的决定，而巳為一般的常識了。一月二十二日，實業部亦會指出自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，如雨後春筍的企業公司，地產公司從事投機的事實，乃聲明禁止此等新公司的新創，但對已創設公司的檢肅，尙未採取積極的手段。會議儘管不厭煩瑣的屡次召開，但如不下决心實行其决議，對於問題的解决，毫無所用。因此不免有人非難國府缺乏强行物價對策的熱忱。</p>
<p>去年八月，國府下决心收買棉紗棉布，但不旋踵物價更比當時綱續急激上漲。要抑制這種情勢，非以數倍於收買棉紗棉布的决心，與周密準備，斷然實施綜合的物價對策不可，這就是物價問題成為深刻的政治問題，不能單作為經濟問題而解决的理由。問題的解决，祇有賴於十國府發動强大的政治力。我們也認為問題的重心已轉移到政治上，而希望國府首先刷新政治，以為强化政治力的前提。（翔：譯自二月二十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>英美最大的陸上正面戰場緬印前綫，現正與日軍激戰中，茲略述前綫情形，以見其混亂情形之一斑：</p>
<p>困於運輸的敵軍</p>
<p>緬印國境交通不便，運鹼困難，敵人現正急起直追，建築道路，以保聯絡。現已開闢了幾條貫通叢林與錯綜水道的　馬道。</p>
<p>其一往阿撒姆出發，經伯多加山脈東端，出富宮康　地。其二為茲茨溪谷通路。其三為利用普位瑪普特拉河洗達伊拉瓦底河的維爾科克斯勞探險路，其四為經瑪尼普爾的陸路。更有一九二○年左右成之測量計劃以連絡緬印的三條道路錢，即北部錢（莫其溫·萊杜間），中部錢（為尼普爾）及沿岸錢（從勃洛姆經馬酋河至吉大港。）</p>
<p>今在富康區域出擊的渝軍，沿茲茨溪谷，越二千五百以上伯多加山脈險峻，而到達拔海二百米左右的富康低地。一至雨季，完全成為汜濫的濕地，故欲在叢林的低地保持兵站，頗為困難，祗賴空中運輸。此次被日軍包圍的英印軍第七師團，英第五師團的主力，亦沿此沿岸錢的計劃棧東侵。但其退路今已被日軍完全切斷。</p>
<p>充炮灰的印度兵</p>
<p>在東部印度，有　待巴頓司令部，歡慶萊克司令部應下的作戰軍，防衛軍等總計約　２萬在　動中。中有英兵（包括蘇格籣兵）　　萬，印度兵　　萬，黑人兵及其他土民兵　　萬，美兵　　萬·及（美式渝軍」　　萬·在阿拉　戰綫出擊的英第五師團，印第七師團中，一部份採用印度人下級將校，但縱令在官階上是上級，也絕對禁止指揮英人。據在　　前錢歸降國民軍的一敵兵稱：</p>
<p>「英美人的俸給在印度兵的二倍以上，食織等如略感缺乏。就完元全不支給印度兵，祇靠徵發。」</p>
<p>他們的　暴在這裹暴露無還。覺悟終非我敵的敵軍，最折正在密林戰訓練所强制訓練印度兵，黑人兵隘路戰，夜　戰等速成戰術，使之充砲灰。</p>
<p>美國式渝軍</p>
<p>最近敵方報道公然稱富康區域的渝軍為（美一國式渝軍」（A·T·C·T）。受　可悲的名稱而甘為其走狗的駐印渝軍，今由富康區域的史蒂威爾指揮官，蒲多那參課長之下的新編第一軍（軍長鄭桐國）第二十二師，第三十八師等組成。二年前，在羅卓英指揮之下，呼號焦土戰術而在緬甸作戰的時候，稱為英渝聯合軍，有着「我們比英軍更强一的自負，並常對美將史蒂威爾就任總指揮官表示不滿，而使當局僅以史蒂威爾為司令官兼軍事顧問的地位。</p>
<p>然而現在他們每一個中隊必有二三名美國指揮者，中隊幹部將校中約半數為美人，在他們指揮之下，稱為美國式的淪軍，啃着芭蕉莖，洗着血汗，從事新路棧的建築工事。</p>
<p>然而養尊處優，乘醉對婦孺施行暴行，變括居民金錢的美將校；英美空軍的盲炸珠江，怒江對岸渝軍，這許多事實，渝軍對之深表不滿，而造成襲擊美將校事件，下級幹部的投降熱等現象。（周：譯自二月二十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　　漢地方發生煤　糾紛後，南威爾士及孟馬斯西亞各煤礦亦自六日起開始罷工，故英國煤業已一陷於重大危穖。孟馬斯西一亞之礦工八千名，以及尼斯與格拉孟岡地方之礦工，以要求改定工資未果，已於六日開始罷工，茲據倫敦來電，亞伯丁地方四煤礦，礦工千名亦於七日參加罷工，此與南威爾士等各煤礦之罷工工人合計約達二萬五千人之多，停工之煤礦總計四十五處。按本年一月英煤業之情勢即已臻嚴重化，英燃料省乃將礦工之最低工資，自四鎊十五先令（一週工資）增至五鎊，然未接受鑛工提出按工作成續酌量般給津貼之要求。竇漢地方，及其他各地鑛工，則一致展開怠工之新戰術，致英燃料省極感棘手。瑞典某報倫敦特派員會於六日就英煤業之危機論稱，鑛工之不滿，乃過去數年間英軍需工業最重要之問題，最近失態更形惡化，其最大原因，　為每日工資之限定，實則礦主方面，幷未支給比最低之工資，故鑛工只有採所謂一怠工戰術，一蓋彼等若行罷工，必受當局處分，故在礦內漸漸工作，致煤之產額減少，使當局極感棘手，現英政府似已不欲以交涉形式，收拾當前事態，勞工大臣具文已對罷工工人發出最後通牒，表示若礦工不即時停止怠工，即將彼等調往他處。泰晤士報傳稱，伊愛頓地方之煤礦牽煤額，每週已自萬五千　激滅至六千五百噸，按英燃料省發表英國之煤產額，每週約滅少四萬噸至五萬噸。</p>

<p>張部長詞</p>
<p>司法行政部長張一鵬氏，於市婦女會舉行之一三八」節紀念大會席上致訓辭，略謂：「一種事業之發展，全觀事業本身，鵝一種健全的表現，那末一天天的可以達到理想的目的，如果本身不能充分健全，那末它表現出來的事情，一定無良好的結果。凡事皆然，而占全民族半數以上的婦女的事業，尤為偉大，尤為重要，但要求婦女界本身的健全，不人有幾點意見：「準備組織能力」不但是婦女界，就是其他各界均應準備組織能力，使全體能幽結一致，往一條路上走。關於婦女界準備組織能力，茲貢獻意見如次：</p>
<p>無論男女，不能無獨立生活，而我國婦女對獨立生活向不講求，而專事依賴，專事依賴的必不會鵝組織能力，要養成　女獨立生活，不得不注意婦女職業，若婦女職　能發蓬起來，婦女組織能力才能發展。</p>
<p>要婦女組織健全。能力加强，先應掃除迷信，不要說是講經拜佛，就是迷信宗敎，也大可不必，只要秉着自己的志向，人的能力比什麼都大，若有了迷信，就把所鵝時間化費於迷信，不求婦女界化費於迷信，不求婦女界本身之間　，如何能健全？</p>
<p>節省。婦女方面的揮霍，鵝時比男子還大，如華裝品等消費，如果不能節約，組織能力，尤其發生障碍，不但物質上要節約。尤於時間上也要注意節約。「應通曉法律常識」我國婦女界一般咸缺乏法律常識，若能通曉法律常識，如婚姻問題等，均不致由於不明瞭法律南昌生錯誤，故云婦女第二應具鵝法律常識。「應研究敎育原理」婦女應研究敎育原理，現在我國男女敎育平等，但敎育的職權吾認為在婦女手裹，而不在男子手裹，家庭主婦應帮助在外勤勞服務社會的丈夫敎育子女，庶幾不使子女長大後由於缺乏家庭敎育，而影響社會，未嫁女子也可以在家敎育弟妹，同時對一般流浪失學的兒童婦女，也可使他們受敎育，成為有用於社會的材料。</p>

<p>銀行錢莊明明是調劑社會金融的公共寢房，公司行號明明是促進社會生產的民間企業，無一不為社會金融圈中所不可缺少的一環，祇怕開設銀行錢莊或經營公司行號者，不麩惑於暴利思　，離開自己所站的崗位，拋棄本身所負的使命，而云參加投　，參加囤積，終至其銀行錢莊或公司行號一變而為物實囤積與證劵投機的策源地，一朝逢着金融市塲發生變動，即不免捲入漩渦，甚至如落葉之遇秋鳳，毫無抵抗之能力，而整個的金融市場，遂益蒙其影響，此之所謂害羣之馬，為我們經濟界中所最要不得的、</p>
<p>去年因政府收買棉紗布而鵝銀行倒閉之讀，今年因股市的暴跌而又鵝一部份小銀行陷於不支之境。這樣一類一碰即倒或一來即不能云的銀行，其平時的業務，旣是一面吸收別人家的金錢云供自己投機的運用，又把這裹面的金錢去博高利貸的利息，到了金融市塲一有波動，復來一個「不了了之」的結束方案，貽害公衆，就此下塲。害羣之馬。孰甚於斯？</p>

<h3 id="c55">長期防空應注意之點 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>自本月三日起，本市實施長期燈火管制，我們就一週以來的觀察，貢獻應行注意之點如次：</p>
<p>這次的燈火管制，或許因為是長期防空，在實施與執行方面，比較過去臨時管制為鬆弛。可是，因為稍稍鬆弛了，當傍晚八時左右，走過每一馬路時，很多處所未加注意，依透露燈光。如果這種情形，不加糾正，那末積漸以後，很可能使防空規則變成具文。</p>
<p>這幾天—舊曆每月中旬—正屆月色皎明的時期，馬路微弱的街燈光度，在月光之下，雖有若無，嚴格的說，是浪費電力。我們認為在月光皎明期間，免除街燈，而移街燈所用電力，補給生產電力的不足。</p>
<p>燈火管制後，脊小乘機活動對於治安問題，亟應妥籌防範，警察如何與保甲自警團取得聯絡？如何巡邏，應迅謀良好方法。</p>
<p>賴街頭營生的小生意人，為數不少，應准許繼續營業，從積極方面指導遵守防空規則，使無背於防空而仍能營生。</p>
<p>以上拉雜所見，願有關當局考慮處置。</p>

<p>日陸軍報道部發言人談</p>
<p>日在滬陸軍部報道部發言人，於昨（八）日在定例報道常會席上，發表最近緬甸戰况，及今後緬甸戰局發展情形，以及反軸心反攻之力量，分析　　，分誌如次：　　緬甸作戰分三區域</p>
<p>緬甸作戰區域計分：阿拉坎，加拉唐，及富　溪谷三處，　阿拉坎方面之戰况，在該區作戰之反軸心軍，為第七師團與第五師團之英印軍，經日軍猛烈之攻擊，英印軍第七師團已全部殲滅，而第五師團已消滅三分之二，此次所獲戰果，計敵遺屍七千具，其中三千具屍體為英兵，俘虜六百人，所獲戰利品計大砲九十二門，戰車與卡車六百輛，擊落飛機六十二架，査英印軍一師團兵力計二萬二千名，故從敵方人力之損害而觀，顯見敵所受損害不貲，不但在人力方面，即物力方面之判斷，行將完全消滅，故在阿拉坎之戰局，敵方失敗無穎，日軍已絕對勝利，　加拉唐戰鬥情形，如敵方西非之土著軍一旅，沿河岸向南方推進，日軍予以迎頭痛擊中，　緬北部國境富貴溪谷地區之戰門。日軍隔塔洛阿怒江與渝在緬遠征軍　峙中，最近渝軍畏　日軍之進攻，在印國境　滄江一帶建築堅　之防禦陣地，企圖調派渝主力向塔洛河北岸進駐，而在滇緬臘戍北方之密支那地區日軍，已準備對該處之敵軍展開殲滅戰，且採取積極攻勢，作戰已在眉睫之間。查一述三區之作戰，敵方全均為個　戰。毫無取得聯絡，　然已吿不利。</p>
<p>英軍畏戰美渝抨擊</p>
<p>日發言人繼分析緬甸作戰之發展程度，首引最近外國電報內容，謂：一在此次阿拉坎第二次之收戰演出，英首相邱吉爾特向該負責人東南亞洲司令　特巴頓電賀」一節，發言人即分析此項情形，敵遭受消滅命運，深恐動搖民心，為穩　掩飾起見，此種對東亞及日本之假作正經。非但不足為奇，實與鄧扣克之情形無異，故是項手腕，掩飾事實，遭受美渝雙方之不滿。再據五日華盛頓電稱：據美方消息靈通人士認為此次印緬戰事無異為防禦戰，觀其用意，在冷視邱之賀電，並認為笑談。又據合衆社駐渝特派員摩　電稱：渝方報紙，指出印緬戰局之失敗，實為史蒂威爾與蒙特巴頓雙方之作戰意見不合所致。更據六日在渝發行之西文報所載，實為英畏懼日軍，以蒙特巴頓定須等待協助艦隊之調到。始行作戰，故美深表不滿。</p>
<p>對日反攻决難實現</p>
<p>日發言人又謂最近渝軍政部長何應欽。出席渝行政院會議席上所報吿之軍事狀况，誇言於三月初在滇緬國境對日　發動大攻勢云云。我人乃認為絕不可能之事，蓋緬甸不久將屆雨季，本年內渝終難反攻。又關於尼米茲，麥克沃塞，西諾爾三人主張之將渝大陸作為對日攻擊之根據地一節，最近觀測彼輩雖有準備待動之趨勢，尙難成為事實。總之欲將渝大陸作為對日反攻之根據地。首先非將緬甸奪回不可，同時尼麥之又一主張，以先突破中央太平洋後，再將渝大陸作為根據地事，此點又不啻成為盡餅，倘須實行，非長時間不可。週溯往昔日俄戰爭，波羅的海作戰情形，及憑目前之情形，反軸心之反攻，在事實上斷不可能。日發言人旋又指引美參加首次歐戰之軍人團長華倫阿柴登所發表之趣談，彼謂觀測目前之比例，如美軍進攻日本，非準備三百萬大軍不可，次又對最近英飛機生產部長史帶克利浦斯之談話，謂進攻日本前達非常達遠，並謂　將目前佔有　大領土之日軍退山，非更加倍努力不可。觀此足蒂反軸心對日反攻之不可能，且英美本身之見解亦參差無異。</p>
<p>渝共糾紛無法解决</p>
<p>繼根據英倫報紙所載上次開羅會議時，渝蔣在席上訴述渝方困難情形頗多，內中以渝大陸作為對日反攻之　據地，首先須將渝內部之共黨問題解决，羅邱蔣三人之意見一致，同時蔣對渝共黨之勢力加以說明，謂渝共黨共有四十萬人盤踞，彼輩在表面上號為實施遊擊戰，實際在渝毫無協助，且在外圍綫擾亂後方，蔣又謂如此　歐亞　局結束後徜共黨勢力依然存在，則中國更將遭受危　云云。日發言人乃加以說明，由此而觀，則將渝大陸作為對日攻擊之根據地，事實上將　困難無疑矣。且逾蔣之解决共黨問題、東　無策，最近各報所載之渝共談判決裂，即使再有談判之可能，恐亦難以解決，何況日前浙東地區渝共火併，作戰甚為猛烈云。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>風波（五）</p>
<p>兵學校假期短促是有名的，不久之後，眞人就要預備回校了。</p>
<p>雖然在這短短的假期裏，好像渾身筋肉都鬆懈了似的不得勁，反倒希望早些回到江田島去。並且母親也是較自己想像以上的健康，由於四古哥的勞力，店裏生意也很興隆。大哥在東京，二哥眞一郞在台灣的高雄任職，家庭的基礎，越發的鞏因起來了。所以眞人對家鄉沒有顧意的必要的。</p>
<p>他唯一放不下的心事，就是對於好朋友　夫的事情。</p>
<p>以後他到牟口田家訪問了數次。但是總沒會見隆夫。帶着淚珠的母親這樣訴說着：「已經像瘋狂了似的，對家裹人也不開口。也不大吃東西——。實在太悲觀了。」但是在眞却沒有甚麼安慰的話可說。</p>
<p>說老實話，我們若想到隆夫的胸中的難過，就使隆夫怎樣地發瘋，也不是沒理由的。從小學以來，像那樣的夢想着「海軍」。並且去年失敗後，捨了兵科的夢想，他不是還倚靠着這一綫的希望的經理科的麼。但連這最後一的錢索的希望，也被截斷了，所以他無論如何發瘋，也不足怪異的。為甚麼運命獨對隆夫是這樣地苛酷呢。志望海軍也是隆夫在先的。本來要做銀行員的自己，作了海軍的學生，像那樣憧憬着「海軍一的隆夫，却被推落絕望的深淵裂——</p>
<p>（眞是運命不好的東西！）眞人在獨自一個人的時候，想到隆夫的境遇，用自己的手揩着眼淚。</p>
<p>歸校的前一天，在參拜東鄕墓地和南洲神社的歸途，他到市公署的人事課長室，訪問了隆夫的父親。因為會不到隆夫，不得已只好去見他的父親。</p>
<p>「喲！—托福，好像是沈靜一點兒了」。</p>
<p>聽到這句話，眞人確實喜歡的不得了。據他父親說：隆夫向他父親提出為靜養這已經破碎了的身和心，要到霧島溫泉去。</p>
<p>「這一時的打擊，若靜養一個月，就可以復原的」。</p>
<p>眞人深知親友所受的創眞，並不是那麽　單地就可以復原的，但是唯有祈禱着那靜寂地的霧島山的空氣，給與隆夫以反省和希望的端緒。他自己提出這種條件，也可以證明他的絕望已經超過極度了。</p>
<p>「在幼時候患的肺炎，沒想到現在還在作崇哪，　」</p>
<p>隆夫的父親一邊送着眞人出來，這樣的說着。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>眞人在宮島站下了火車，聚到學校指定的地方，和很多的同學們，乘着學校的汽艇歸校去了。</p>
<p>見到古鷹山，繫留練習艦和學生館的容姿的瞬間，肉體上巳經感到了緊張，所謂「俗世」的憂慮或喜悅，也不知飛向何處去了。</p>
<p>從第二天起又開始了那精魂和規律的生活。在九月中問，還是夏天的課程，然而澄靜地江田內的海，越發顯着深藍，早朝的凉水浴的水，有時也感到冷氣沁心。然而過分明媚的島上的風光，雖然秋天將要來臨，但是表面上總也看不出來。</p>
<p>眞人們已經過了一學期，所以也不是新四號了。對向於敎官同上級生的敬禮，也好像是反應式的作着。「你，我」，這等的名詞，也很自然地使用着。並且聽到在秋季的學期裏，舉行登彌山和原村的郊外演習，特別喚起了他們的興趣。</p>
<p>眞人從新學期起，特別努力作柔術的功課。因為是從中學時代就最得意於柔術的，所以希望將來一定要有一點成就的，最低限度在畢業前必須要得到初段。兵學校的道塲，柔劍術都是非常宏六的，所以學生們自誇為「世界第一」。在那裏所行的功課，其猛烈程度，恐怕也要居世界第一位。並不是所謂作功課等名詞所可想像的，帶有必死的氣魄的·其中眞人的認眞，是特別的，當時的柔術擔任敎官，從講道能聘諸來的臼淵七段，還記憶着當時的情形。據說眞人何時都是選擇比自己實力在上的人做對手，授敎的態度也很積極的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Core of the Price Issue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, in its editorial of February 25th titled "The Core of China's Price Problem" (translated and published in today's edition of this newspaper), makes key points that are quite similar to what we have been advocating. We are deeply impressed by the Allied nations' concern for China's price problem, their profound observations, and insightful understanding.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun states: "The price problem has developed into a profound political issue and cannot be resolved as an economic problem." It also states: "The focus of the problem has shifted to politics, and it is hoped that the National Government will first reform politics as a prerequisite for strengthening its political power." This view has indeed grasped the core of China's price problem. We have previously stated regarding the price issue: "Economic measures alone are insufficient to save the crisis; political reform must come first, so that political power and economic measures can work together." It can be said that our views are the same.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun also states: "Although meetings are convened repeatedly without tiring of the details, if there is no determination to implement the resolutions, they will be of no use in solving the problem. Therefore, some people cannot help but criticize the National Government for lacking enthusiasm for strong price control measures." In our editorial of February 22nd, we specifically pointed out that "in the past, the work of suppressing prices has been universally valued by both the government and the public. The institutions managing prices and the methods of adjusting prices cannot be said to be incomplete or not thorough. However, the facts show that they have failed to achieve the expected results, and the crux of the problem lies in 'ineffective implementation' and 'inappropriate implementation'." "Ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation" mean "not being determined to implement the resolutions of the meetings." Of course, this is of no use in solving the price problem. However, "political reform is not something that can be done overnight; a determination must be made to establish a government of good people." As for the most urgent measures to suppress prices at present, we have always believed that the following two points must be implemented to be effective:</p>
<p>First, daily necessities must be provided with a minimum level of supply. In particular, rice and coal, which are essential for daily life, are the most important. Whether based on theory or past practical experience, each drastic price fluctuation is always led by rice or coal. The reason why rice and coal have become serious problems is not objectively due to a lack of supply. As far as Shanghai is concerned, there have been no reports of people starving to death due to a lack of rice or coal. Moreover, Shanghai is a city that does not produce rice or coal, yet it is not lacking. So, if there is no actual shortage, what is the reason for the continuous price surge? It is because of the black market and smuggling. Therefore, we advocate eliminating the black market and replacing it with public prices, and cracking down on smuggling and replacing it with public transportation. However, if coercive methods are used to eliminate the black market, it will not only be ineffective but will also lead to more hoarding. Only by increasing the amount of rationing and maintaining the minimum needs, so that people do not have to seek help from the black market, will the black market disappear on its own. For example, the current rationing of rice per household is six *sheng* per person per month, while the minimum need is an average of one *dou* and five *sheng* per person per month. The difference of nine *sheng*, in addition to being made up by household flour, is sought from the black market. The black market will then naturally exist, and since it is called the black market, it is very likely to fluctuate irregularly.</p>
<p>Second, most daily necessities other than rice and coal are industrial products. If we want to ensure an uninterrupted supply, continuous production is the only condition. To demand continuous production, industrial raw materials and power are essential. If raw materials are difficult to obtain and power is restricted, it is already difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone increase production.</p>
<p>Third, the management or control agencies directly or indirectly related to prices must be unified in terms of system and authority, and overlapping structures must be absolutely avoided. Too many branches not only waste public funds but also hinder operations. As a result, things become more chaotic, and nothing is accomplished.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the core of the price problem lies in reforming politics, exerting political power, and coordinating economic measures in order to thoroughly save the crisis. The most urgent measure to treat the symptoms is to increase the rationing of rice and coal, gradually approaching the minimum needs. For daily necessities that are industrial products, at least raw materials and power should be supplied to maintain the original level of production. At the same time, the authority of the management agencies must be unified in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. All three are indispensable, and lacking one is enough to affect the overall situation.</p>

After the speech, Matsutaro Shoriki, the president of Yomiuri, Shinjiro Takaishi, the chairman of Mainichi, and Takeora Ogata, the vice president of Asahi, delivered speeches on the topics of "Modern Warfare and the Rear," "Final Victory," and "Remembering the Fallen Heroes." Finally, Ichiro Tokutomi, the chairman of the Discourse Association, gave a passionate speech titled "The Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars in the Holy War of Greater East Asia." The audience was deeply moved by the magnanimous speech. Finally, they shouted "Long live the Emperor" and dispersed at about 4 PM.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: A dispatch from a Japanese military base in Burma: The Japanese Air Force in Burma, in cooperation with ground forces, intercepted three enemy aircraft that infiltrated the airspace near Rangoon at noon on the 6th. As a result, they shot down two of them, and the remaining one escaped. The Japanese forces suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 8th: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Command announced a battle report on the 7th stating that Japanese forces had launched two forceful attacks on British positions on the main front west of the Mayu Mountains.</p>
<p>Interview with a Lieutenant of the British 7th Division</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 8th: When the Japanese forces in the Indo-Burmese border annihilated the British 7th Division in the Sinzweya Basin, they captured a large number of British soldiers. According to a captured lieutenant of the British 7th Division, the British 7th Division, after completing operations in North Africa, was transferred to India and reorganized with elite troops who were undergoing jungle warfare training at Chilang, 40 kilometers west of Calcutta. In terms of ethnicity, British and Gurkha soldiers each accounted for 23%, and Sikh and Punjabi soldiers accounted for a total of 50%. The commander was initially Lieutenant General Copert, but after the reorganization, it was Major General Mirabi. From 1934 to 1940, the Major General served as a brigade commander in the Near East and also served in the Indian Army Headquarters. He was truly a fierce general. Under his guidance, the 7th Division and the 4th Division were the most elite forces in India. In early October of the previous year, the 7th Division and the 26th Division alternated in moving to the front lines. When the Na Keidok Highway was opened, they began to gather east of Sinzweya in mid-October, preparing for battle. Commander Mountbatten attached great importance to the battle situation in that area. On December 7th of last year, he visited Na Keidok with the commander of the 14th Army and the commander of the 15th Army to inspect the defense and encourage the soldiers. On January 8th of this year, he visited the commander of the 15th Army on the front lines to give instructions. At that time, the morale of the entire army was quite good. The division commander had submitted his opinion to the higher authorities, stating that it would be most appropriate to start the offensive around mid-January, but the commander of the 16th Army did not agree, and it was planned to start the offensive around mid-February. Unexpectedly, the Japanese forces preemptively launched an attack first, and the Japanese forces' courage in combat was truly unexpected. Now the Japanese forces have cut off our supply route. This was my first time fighting against the Japanese forces, and I deeply felt that the Japanese forces were disciplined and had excellent combat strength. The Japanese forces' courage in combat had caused the supposedly most elite 7th Division to collapse. The division commander abandoned his troops and fled in advance due to the unfavorable battle situation. The division headquarters has been ravaged by the Japanese forces, and the morale of the entire army has been completely lost. Moreover, the Indian National Army is fighting alongside the Japanese forces, which has a great impact on the Indian soldiers. The Indian soldiers may waver, and although the British Indian Army authorities are trying their best to prevent this, I believe that the Indian soldiers will withdraw from the front lines sooner or later.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Major Victory for Japanese Forces in North China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tianjin, 8th: Since February 22nd of this year, Japanese forces in North China have been engaged in suppressing Communist forces in the Jin District. As of February 29th, the comprehensive battle results are as follows: 59 bodies of Communist soldiers recovered, 95 captured, 51 underground trenches and 1 arsenal destroyed, 75 rifles, 1,072 rounds of ammunition, 147 rounds of pistol ammunition, 60 foreign cannons, 157 hand grenades, and a large number of other military supplies seized.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao, 8th: In February, Japanese forces in Shandong Province cleared out the Communist forces in eastern and southern Shandong. The comprehensive battle results are as follows: 52 engagements, 8,089 Communist soldiers engaged, 462 Communist soldiers' bodies recovered by the Japanese forces, 109 captured, 2 Communist facilities destroyed, 197 rifles, 1,621 rounds of rifle ammunition, 10 pistols, 62 hand grenades, and a large number of other miscellaneous items and rations seized.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 8th: The Indian people's movement to demand the release of political prisoners, which was triggered by the death of Gandhi's wife in prison, has intensified, causing the Indian Governor-General's office to feel extremely helpless. According to a broadcast on the 4th, the majority of the delegates attending the joint conference of the Indian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry held in New Delhi have submitted a resolution to the government demanding the immediate release of political prisoners and that they be granted the authority to organize a federation, and that this be strongly advocated as a peaceful solution desired by India. Therefore, the movement to release political prisoners is becoming more and more intense.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Core of China's Price Problem <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in August of last year, prices in China had been calm for a while, but since around November, they have risen sharply again. The prices of major daily necessities such as food, clothing, and fuel have skyrocketed, far exceeding those at that time, and there seems to be no end to the increase. For example, cotton yarn and cloth had already risen by about two times compared to the time of purchase by the end of last year. The price problem can be said to have developed into a profound political problem and cannot be resolved as an economic problem.</p>
<p>Suppressing rising prices, ensuring the livelihood of the people, and overcoming the obstacles to increased production are among the greatest political tasks that the National Government should undertake at present. If the National Government lacks decisiveness in carrying out these responsibilities or resorts to perfunctory measures, it cannot be said that it is abandoning its own mission.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of wartime inflation is, needless to say, caused by increased production and the imbalance of materials. However, the recent rise in prices in China is mostly due to the enemy's instigation, the influence of pessimistic psychology regarding the recovery of the Chinese economy, and speculative hoarding. The trend of speculative hoarding has now become widespread throughout the country and has become a popular trend. Huge amounts of floating capital are used to purchase materials, thereby promoting the endless rise in prices.</p>
<p>The Price Liaison Conference of the five provinces and one city in Central China, which was held in Shanghai on the 22nd, decided that those who engage in speculative hoarding and violate economic regulations will be severely punished, given the recent rise in prices, which is not due to a shortage of materials. Solving the price problem hinges on cracking down on speculative hoarding. This is common knowledge, even before the decision of the conference. On January 22nd, the Ministry of Industry also pointed out the fact that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, companies and real estate companies have been engaging in speculation like mushrooms after the rain. It stated that the creation of such new companies was prohibited, but it has not taken active measures to investigate and punish existing companies. Although meetings are convened repeatedly without tiring of the details, if there is no determination to implement the resolutions, they will be of no use in solving the problem. Therefore, some people cannot help but criticize the National Government for lacking enthusiasm for strong price control measures.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the National Government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, but before long, prices rose even more rapidly and sharply than at that time. To suppress this situation, a comprehensive price control measure must be decisively implemented with several times the determination and thorough preparation of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth. This is the reason why the price problem has become a profound political problem and cannot be solved simply as an economic problem. The solution to the problem lies only in the National Government unleashing strong political power. We also believe that the focus of the problem has shifted to politics, and we hope that the National Government will first reform politics as a prerequisite for strengthening its political power.

<h3 id="e7">Heavy Losses for Australian Troops in Eastern New Guinea; Difficulties in Supplies and Weakening of Actions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base in New Guinea, in eastern New Guinea, the Australian 7th Division is mainly moving north along the Ramu River valley, attempting to attack the Japanese base in Madang, eastern New Guinea. The Japanese forces in that area are using superhuman jungle warfare tactics to strike and reduce the enemy forces everywhere. Since the start of the Abit operation in September of last year, this unit has inflicted great damage on the enemy, killing more than 2,800 enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered about 500 deaths in Abit, more than 500 deaths in December, more than 1,200 deaths in the battles of Joy Ridge and Screen Mountain, and 200 deaths in the Battle of Madero. In addition, the Japanese forces have launched ambush and guerrilla warfare everywhere, killing more than 500 enemy soldiers. Furthermore, the Ramu River valley area is a high-temperature and high-humidity zone, and enemy soldiers are suffering from malaria and scabies, with injuries and illnesses occurring one after another. Almost all of the lower halves of the bodies of the enemy prisoners of war are covered in sores. Therefore, in just three months, the average number of soldiers has decreased by about 20-30%. On the contrary, the Japanese forces occupy many highlands, and the environment is much better than the enemy's occupied areas. The combat strength is extremely strong, and the enemy's supply base is far in the rear, relying on air transport for supplies, which is quite difficult. Therefore, the enemy's actions have weakened significantly since February. Furthermore, according to an Australian prisoner of war obtained in that area, the supplies for the Australian 7th Division are extremely poor compared to the air force and the American forces, and they are often sent to areas where the Japanese forces are strongly resisting. Therefore, the Australian forces have long harbored resentment.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rabaul: Twenty-three Type 24 aircraft and four Type 38 aircraft attacked Gabien on New Ireland Island on the afternoon of the 6th. After being intercepted by the local Japanese forces, they fled. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base in the Pacific on the 8th, a Japanese naval air squadron discovered an enemy large-sized torpedo boat on the western sea south of Bogenville Island on the night of the 6th and destroyed it.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Thailand Plans to Purchase Mining Machinery from Japan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Bangkok, 8th: The tin and other extractive industries in Thailand declined somewhat after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Recently, with the active revitalization by the government, they are rapidly recovering their former state. Sanintan, the director of the Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, recently stated: In order to revitalize the mining industry, the Thai government established the Thailand Tin Rubber Company in January of the previous year to purchase various mineral products and seek to guide mining methods. Therefore, the results are gradually improving. Now, the various mines lack various equipment for mining and are negotiating purchases with Japan. It is expected that this issue will be resolved soon.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japanese Military Doctor Discovers Radiation Therapy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 7th: According to a telephone call from Osaka, the method of treating malaria researched by British and American doctors has failed. Recently, the Japanese military medical scholar, Colonel Takezo Kikawa, the chief of the medical department of the Osaka Division, finally succeeded in his research and obtained a doctorate in medicine. In the past, in order to thoroughly treat malaria, quinine hydrochloride and other drugs were injected to bring the pathogens lurking in the human body into the blood to eliminate them. To induce the pathogens, most countries in the world use the method of injecting protein and adrenaline (stimulants). Colonel Kikawa has now proved that although this method can induce the pathogens parasitizing in the blood cells, it is not very effective for those parasitizing inside the human body and in the liver and bone marrow. Therefore, it is ineffective for latent and chronic malaria. He also discovered a new treatment method using X-ray radiation, ultraviolet rays, and infrared rays. This great discovery was actually made in May of the 14th year of Showa (1939). For the next four years, he devoted all his efforts to research the place and time to use radiation, and finally obtained a safe and effective treatment method, establishing a great achievement in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Greater East Asia War Intensifying; Enemy Situation Increasingly Unfavorable; Statement Released Yesterday by Japanese Military Authorities in North China <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Beijing, 8th: The Japanese military authorities in North China, with March 10th marking the 39th Japanese Army Memorial Day, released a statement at 3 PM on the 8th, expressing their determination to strive for victory. The general idea was that the Greater East Asia War is intensifying, and fierce decisive battles are currently underway in the vast war zone of the Pacific. At this time, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are exerting all their efforts and fighting together to crush the ambitions of Britain and America, which is truly commendable. Due to the prolongation of the war, the enemy's internal and external situations are becoming increasingly unfavorable. In their anxiety, they have repeatedly launched counterattacks and engaged in great propaganda. The various activities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have also become active due to the strategies and propaganda of Britain and America, or to spread rumors about the trends in the war situation, disrupt public order, and launch terrorist tactics. The Japanese army, in addition to thoroughly crushing their actions, also sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will not be swayed by their behavior. As the 39th Army Memorial Day is about to arrive, we must adhere to our belief in victory, and under the close cooperation between China and Japan, strive to achieve the liberation of Greater East Asia.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 8th: The Information Department of the Japanese Embassy released a statement at 3 PM on the 8th, stating that Ambassador Tani, after inspecting Guangdong and Hankou a few days ago, departed from Beijing on the 1st of this month and went to inspect Zhangjiakou, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. He also convened meetings with senior Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials in various places. Now that the mission has been completed, he returned to Beijing on the 8th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Peiping, 8th: Japanese Ambassador to China Masayuki Tani, in order to inspect the general situation in the Zhangjiakou, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan areas, arrived here on the 1st. After completing the inspection in the valley, he flew back to the blind capital from Jinan by plane on the morning of the 8th. Ambassador Tani held a press conference here on the 2nd and stated that since the implementation of Japan's new policy toward China, various parties have praised its achievements. Since Japan is determined to help China strive for autonomy and independence, its new policy toward China will remain unchanged. The National Government's implementation of clean government and streamlining of personnel is in response to Japan's new policy toward China. We must know that Japan's new policy toward China is the core of the construction of Greater East Asia, which is why Japan is striving to achieve it. As for the price problem, the National Government has gradually established a controlled economy and is actively cracking down on hoarding. With the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, Shanghai's economic power has been promoted. Coal in North China has a profound impact on prices in Central China. It is now being smoothly transported to various parts of Central China, so the price prospects can be optimistic. The most pleasant thing about this trip north is that Chairman Wang has penetrated political power in the construction work. Moreover, the increased production of important wartime resources in North China has yielded great results and is now being implemented with all its strength, and the construction work in North China is being promoted.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has launched the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India, causing East Asians to kill each other. Recently, their forces have been successively defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost. Therefore, they are increasingly resorting to cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas. They daily instigate the Chongqing faction to continuously invade, in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects, and even use their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to carry out bombings in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places in our country, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willing to be used by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, is certainly despicable. However, Britain and the United States, harboring malicious intentions towards East Asia, have exhausted their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which is something that the East Asian nations should collectively oppose. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and the United States. It will devote all its efforts to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Manchuria, Thailand, and the Nanjing government, are steadfastly friendly, and are particularly of one mind regarding the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they will further promote cooperation, in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Our friendly nations Germany and Italy, have been contending with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years, and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and will echo each other, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of the Founding Father of the nation. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of peace and good faith for the entire world, depend on this. Let us be of one heart and one mind, exerting our efforts from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of a great era!</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to suppress commodity prices, ensure wartime resources, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Mengjiang government has formulated the key points of the commodity price control policy to supplement the second Mengjiang commodity price countermeasures formulated in May last year, with the aim of strictly implementing them and actively promoting economic construction. The main points of the commodity price restriction outlined this time will focus on the following aspects compared with the second commodity price countermeasure, with the aim of actively promoting implementation. It is expected that this commodity price policy will achieve great results: 1) Thoroughly implement the self-sufficiency system; 2) Thoroughly rectify and expand light industry; 3) Rectify import agencies; 4) Expand official fixed price materials; 5) Strengthen the control of transportation costs; 6) Strengthen labor management; 7) Strengthen the organizational strength of the Wartime Materials Adjustment Committee; 8) Promulgate the Public Security Protection Law; 9) Rectify and crack down on laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to establish public security, the Mengjiang government has recently formulated the Public Security Protection Law. Severe punishments will be imposed for major offenses such as attempting to disrupt order and disturb public security. The main purpose of the law is to suppress the activities of the Communist Party. The full text consists of twelve articles, and the provisions are extremely severe.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to plan for the improvement of the legal system and establish public security, the Mengjiang authorities have specially stipulated the Public Security Protection Law, which was promulgated on the 8th.

<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Zhang, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Department, met with reporters yesterday and answered reporters' questions regarding the establishment of the provincial alcohol factory and the increase in liquid fuel production in the province as follows: During this tense wartime period, it is necessary to make every effort to increase the production of all materials related to the war. Liquid fuel is especially a necessary material in wartime. Recently, the source of gasoline has been dwindling, and in order to maintain transportation in the province and for military purposes, we should find ways to obtain this resource. Since our province has no mining, we can only take a step back and use alcohol instead. Therefore, the establishment of the alcohol factory will not only provide a new source for the supply of liquid fuel in the province, but also make a major contribution to military use. Currently, the factory's monthly production is about 13,000 gallons of pure alcohol, with excellent concentration, and there is a sufficient supply of sulfuric acid.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Washington: The opposition between the United States and Britain, centered on the development of West Asian oil resources, is becoming increasingly serious, leading to difficult diplomatic problems. U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius met with reporters on the 7th and announced that the United States and Britain will convene an oil meeting. It is said that the U.S. and British governments have decided to hold preparatory talks on oil issues before holding formal talks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) In the US government's West Asian oil resources development plan, there is a proposal to build an oil pipeline from the Persian Gulf area to the Mediterranean coast, which has caused diplomatic disputes between the United States and Britain. Recently, the U.S. Congress and various parties have also fiercely opposed it. The U.S. Petroleum Industry Wartime Council specifically issued a white paper on the 6th, attacking the government's plan, saying: "During this wartime, which country can be expected to cooperate with the United States in the next war? Which country can be expected to actively participate in the collective security system? Does the United States intend to exercise its police power anywhere in the world? To exercise this kind of police power, is it necessary for the United States to ensure military bases and supply bases all over the world?" According to the Petroleum Industry Wartime Council, it is a consulting body for Ickes' Wartime Petroleum Adjustment Bureau. Since the consulting body has issued such a dissenting opinion, Ickes' position has become increasingly difficult.</p>

The sailors who will receive the Italian warships have departed for Malta in the Mediterranean, which will be the place of transfer. Soviet diplomats will also fly to participate in this event. Part of the warships will be stationed in the ports of Algiers, and the rest will sail to other ports in North Africa."</p>
<p>Bern, 8th (Central News Agency) The Swiss National Newspaper, under the headline "The Soviet Union as a Naval Power," discussed that after the Second World War, the Soviet Union could eliminate its disadvantages against Britain and the United States in the peace conference, that is, obtain naval bases for its fleet and merchant ships to dock and obtain contact with the outer ocean, and no longer be cut off. In the future, it will learn that occupying and seizing the port in northern Norway has already suffered this crisis. It is determined to obtain the port in Persia after the war, so that its sea access problem can be completely solved. And the Soviet Union will not be satisfied with partially solving this problem. She said that the region is also controlled by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, just like the Arctic Ocean and Persia. The Soviet Union's development from a land power into a sea and land power seems to be an unstoppable trend. This development is even more evident in the transfer of one-third of the Italian ships to the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Situation of Indian and Chongqing Troops on the Burma-India Frontline <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Burma-India front, the largest land front for the British and Americans, is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The following is a brief description of the situation on the front line to show a glimpse of the chaotic situation:</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Trapped by Transportation</p>
<p>Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in shipping supplies in the Burma-India border area, the enemy is now urgently catching up, building roads to maintain contact. Several trails have now been opened up that run through jungles and intricate waterways.</p>
<p>One starts from Assam, passes through the eastern end of the Patkai Mountains, and exits the Hukawng Valley. The second is the route through the Ledo Road. The third is the Wilcox-Tanner exploration route that utilizes the Brahmaputra River and the Irrawaddy River. The fourth is the land route through Manipur. There are also three roads planned around 1920 to connect Burma and India, namely the northern route (Myitkyina-Ledo), the central route (Imphal), and the coastal route (from Chittagong through Maungdaw).</p>
<p>The Chongqing troops currently attacking in the Hukawng area cross the treacherous Patkai Mountains over 2,500 meters above sea level along the Ledo Road and reach the lowlands of Hukawng, which are about 200 meters above sea level. Once the rainy season arrives, it becomes a completely flooded wetland, so it is quite difficult to maintain a supply station in the jungle lowlands and rely on air transport. The main force of the British 7th Division and the British 5th Division, which were encircled by the Japanese army this time, also invaded along this planned coastal route. However, their retreat has now been completely cut off by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Indian Soldiers as Cannon Fodder</p>
<p>In eastern India, there are operational troops, defense troops, etc., under the command of Patton and Lake, totaling about 200,000 troops in action. Among them are British soldiers (including Scottish soldiers), 50,000 Indian soldiers, 100,000 black soldiers and other indigenous soldiers, and 10,000 American soldiers and 50,000 Chongqing troops (American-style Chongqing troops). In the British 5th Division and the Indian 7th Division, which are attacking on the Arakan front, some Indian junior officers are used, but even if they are in a higher rank, they are absolutely prohibited from commanding the British. According to an enemy soldier who surrendered to the National Army on the Arakan front:</p>
<p>"The British and Americans receive more than twice the salary of the Indian soldiers, and food and clothing are not supplied to the Indian soldiers at all if they feel slightly lacking. They only rely on requisition."</p>
<p>Their brutality is exposed here. The enemy, who finally realized that we are not their enemies, is now forcibly training Indian soldiers in jungle warfare training camps, teaching them crash course tactics such as ambush warfare and night warfare, making them cannon fodder.</p>
<p>American-Style Chongqing Troops</p>
<p>Recently, enemy reports openly refer to the Chongqing troops in the Hukawng area as "American-style Chongqing troops" (A.T.C.T.). The Chongqing troops stationed in India, who accept this pitiful name and are willing to be their pawns, are now composed of the New First Army (Commander Zheng Tongguo), the 22nd Division, and the 38th Division under the command of Stilwell, the commander of the Hukawng area, and Buna, the chief of staff. Two years ago, when they were fighting in Burma under the command of Luo Zhuoying, calling for a scorched earth tactic, they were called the British-Chongqing Allied Forces, and they had "a self-esteem that we are stronger than the British army," and often expressed dissatisfaction with the appointment of American General Stilwell as the commander-in-chief, so the authorities only made Stilwell the commander and military adviser.</p>
<p>However, now each of their companies must have two or three American commanders, and about half of the company officers are Americans. Under their command, they are called American-style fallen troops, gnawing on banana stems, washing away blood and sweat, and engaging in the construction work of new roads.</p>
<p>However, the facts that American officers live in luxury, commit atrocities against women and children while drunk, extort money from residents, and that British and American air forces blindly bomb the Zhujiang and the Chongqing troops on the other side of the Nu River, have caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chongqing troops, resulting in attacks on American officers and a surge in the number of junior officers surrendering.

<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) German News Agency report, military news: A large formation of American bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew over western Germany at 12:30 pm today, and fierce air battles began over northwestern Germany after 1:00 pm, especially north and west of Hanover. Today's weather is similar to that of the 6th.</p>
<p>Another report. According to the official German war report: American aircraft attacked Rome and other cities in central Italy again yesterday, and several areas of Rome suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) A telegram from Rome stated that on the 7th, the reactionary air force blindly bombed Rome twice continuously from 11:00 am, dropping a large number of incendiary bombs and high-performance bombs. The Church of Saint Quirin was completely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e33">140 American Aircraft Lost in Attacks on Berlin <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) A press release from the German Supreme Headquarters at noon on the 7th stated: American aircraft formations attacked Berlin at noon on the 6th. The German air defense forces achieved great results. Only a residential area in the city suffered slight damage. The German army shot down 118 of its four-engine bombers and a total of 140 aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) The American air raids on Berlin have been carried out daily since the 4th. In addition to dropping bombs, a large number of leaflets were also distributed. When American aircraft attacked on the 6th, a large number of propaganda materials were also distributed, stating that Germany could only be saved by peace, and adding various defenses, but the Germans ignored them all. The Germans generally believe that the United States promoted peace to the Italians six months ago when the Italian fascist regime broke its promises. Now they are treating the Germans with the same means, which is really shameless. How can the Germans fall for their tricks again?</p>
<h3 id="e34">Only Artillery Battles at the Anzio Beachhead Allied Troop Movements Continue <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, (Central News Agency) The German authorities claimed on the 7th regarding the war situation as follows: There were no large-scale operations at the Anzio beachhead. Only the artillery teams of the two armies launched active attacks. The German heavy mortar team shelled two American mechanized artillery positions east of the Anzio-Aprilia highway, destroying several British heavy tank guns and mortars, and an ammunition depot. The anti-Axis forces are actively moving troops behind the Chen terrain. It seems that the American army is preparing to launch an offensive.</p>

<h3 id="e37">British Miners' Strike Spreads Coal Industry in Major Crisis <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Central News Agency) After a coal mine dispute occurred in Durham, South Wales and Monmouthshire coal mines also began to strike on the 6th, so the British coal industry has fallen into a major crisis. Eight thousand miners in Monmouthshire and the miners in Neath and Glamorgan began to strike on the 6th because their demand for wage revision was not met. According to a telegram from London, 1,000 miners in four coal mines in Aberdeen also joined the strike on the 7th. The total number of strikers in South Wales and other coal mines is about 25,000, and the total number of coal mines closed is 45. As early as January this year, the situation of the British coal industry had become serious. The British Fuel Ministry increased the minimum wage of miners from four pounds and fifteen shillings (weekly wage) to five pounds, but did not accept the miners' request for subsidies based on work performance. The miners in Durham and other places unanimously launched a new tactic of going slow, which made the British Fuel Ministry feel very tricky. A special correspondent in London for a Swedish newspaper commented on the crisis in the British coal industry on the 6th, saying that the miners' dissatisfaction has been the most important problem in the British military industry in the past few years. The recent situation has deteriorated even further. The biggest reason is the limitation of daily wages. In fact, the mine owners have not paid less than the minimum wage, so the miners have no choice but to adopt the so-called go-slow tactic, because if they go on strike, they will be punished by the authorities, so they gradually work in the mine, which reduces the output of coal, making the authorities feel very tricky. It seems that the British government is unwilling to resolve the current situation through negotiations. The Minister of Labor has issued an ultimatum to the striking workers, stating that if the miners do not stop going slow immediately, they will be transferred elsewhere. The Times reported that the coal output in the Eaton area has dropped sharply from 15,000 tons per week to 6,500 tons. According to the British Fuel Ministry, the coal output in the United Kingdom has decreased by about 40,000 to 50,000 tons per week.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association, in order to commemorate the "March 8th" International Women's Day, jointly with the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Welfare Association, the Midwifery Association, and women from all walks of life, held a grand commemoration ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow Association Hall on Xizang Road at 10:00 yesterday morning. Government officials who attended and delivered speeches included Minister Zhang Yipeng, Mayor Chen's representative Lin Jiongying, Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government's representative Cui Jingyu, Director Chen Dongbai, Director Liang's representative Secretary Pan, representatives from the German and Japanese women's circles, and more than a thousand representatives of all members of the association, gathered together, and the situation was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Meeting</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Qu Zhonglun (Municipal Women's Association), Pang Jiacan (Women's Welfare Association), Yuan Huiyu (Midwifery Association), Yu Ming (Academic Circles), and Lin Meishu (Education Circles). After singing the "March 8th" Women's Commemoration Song, the chairman of the Women's Association, Qu Zhonglun, delivered an opening speech, elaborating on the history of the women's movement and the efforts that women's circles should make in the future. Then, Minister Zhang Yipeng was invited to deliver a speech. After the speech, Director Lin of the Municipal Government was invited to deliver a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen. Subsequently, women representatives from all walks of life, such as Lin Meishu and Yuan Huiyu, delivered speeches in succession, and then the ceremony was declared completed in the melodious sound of music. At 3:00 in the afternoon, the association held a symposium at the News United Association, chaired by Qu Zhonglun, to discuss the fundraising for the Midwifery Fund and the establishment of social service centers, etc., and the atmosphere was very pleasant, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00.</p>
<p>Minister Zhang's Speech</p>
<p>Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng delivered a speech at the "March 8th" Commemoration Meeting held by the Municipal Women's Association, saying: "The development of a cause depends entirely on the cause itself. A sound performance can achieve the ideal goal day by day. If it cannot be fully sound, then the things it expresses will not have good results. This is true of everything, and the cause of women, who account for more than half of the entire nation, is even greater and more important. However, in order to demand the soundness of women's circles themselves, I have a few opinions: "Preparing organizational ability" is not only for women's circles, but also for other circles. We should prepare organizational ability so that the whole can be united and move in one direction. Regarding the preparation of organizational ability for women's circles, I offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Regardless of men or women, one cannot be without independent living, but Chinese women have never paid attention to independent living and specialize in relying on others. Those who specialize in relying on others will not have organizational ability. To cultivate women's independent living, one must pay attention to women's occupations. If women's occupations can flourish, women's organizational ability can develop.</p>
<p>To make women's organizations sound and strengthen their ability, one must first eliminate superstition. Not to mention chanting scriptures and worshipping Buddha, even superstitious religions are unnecessary. As long as you adhere to your own aspirations, human ability is greater than anything else. If you have superstition, you will spend your time on superstition. If you do not seek women's circles to spend time on superstition, how can you be sound?</p>
<p>Saving. Women's extravagance is sometimes greater than that of men, such as spending on gorgeous clothing. If you cannot save, organizational ability will be hindered. Not only should you save on materials, but you should also pay attention to saving on time. "You should understand legal knowledge." Women's circles in our country generally lack legal knowledge. If you can understand legal knowledge, such as marriage issues, you will not make mistakes due to ignorance of the law. Therefore, it is said that women should have legal knowledge. "You should study educational principles." Women should study educational principles. Now, men and women in our country have equal education, but I believe that the authority of education is in the hands of women, not in the hands of men. Housewives should help their husbands who are working hard and serving society outside to educate their children, so that their children will not grow up and affect society due to lack of family education. Unmarried women can also educate their younger siblings at home, and at the same time, they can also educate homeless and out-of-school children and women, so that they can become useful materials for society.</p>

<p>Police Station Dispatches Personnel for Secret Investigation</p>
<p>The authorities in this city are extremely strict in reviewing and issuing various automobile licenses, and they must verify that the applicant truly has a legitimate need for business purposes before issuing them. Therefore, those who have their own cars must be mindful of the authorities' intention to conserve material resources and use them properly. Recently, it has been learned that privately owned cars are often parked in front of dance halls and brothels, which is obviously contrary to the authorities' intention to carefully review and issue licenses. The police station has recently dispatched personnel for secret investigation in order to take appropriate disciplinary action.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: Since the outbreak of epidemic meningitis in the entire Nanshi area, although patients have been sent to hospitals for diagnosis and treatment, eight or nine out of ten have died. The spread of the disease is extremely rampant. The Nanshi Health Office is working closely with the Third Police Branch of Nanshi to do its utmost to eradicate the disease. Areas where meningitis has already occurred are now being locked down separately and subjected to local disinfection in order to reduce the scope of the epidemic's spread. However, if the accumulated filth in Nanshi is not cleared up for a day, the source of the epidemic will be difficult to eradicate for a day.

<p>Economic Circles Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e49">Do Not Harm the Herd <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Banks and money shops are clearly public bedrooms for adjusting social finance, and companies and firms are clearly private enterprises that promote social production, both of which are indispensable links in the social financial circle. The only thing to fear is that those who open banks and money shops or operate companies and firms are not bewitched by the idea of ​​windfall profits, leave their posts, abandon their missions, and participate in investment and hoarding, eventually turning their banks and money shops or companies and firms into the source of material hoarding and securities speculation. Once the financial market changes, they will inevitably be swept into the vortex, even like fallen leaves encountering autumn phoenixes, with no ability to resist, and the entire financial market will suffer its influence. This is what is meant by harming the herd, which is most undesirable in our economic circles.</p>
<p>Last year, some banks went bankrupt due to the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and this year, some small banks have been brought to the brink of collapse due to the stock market crash. Banks of this kind that collapse with a single touch or cannot stand with a single blow absorb other people's money on the one hand and use it for their own speculative operations, and on the other hand, they use the money inside to gamble on high-interest loans. When the financial market fluctuates, they come up with a "no-end" solution, harming the public and leaving the stage. What is more harmful to the herd than this?</p>
<p>We have spoken about rigorously implementing self-discipline and merging small banks countless times before, but we always feel that the speaker is sincere, and the listener is dismissive. Even in the most recent issue of this newspaper's monthly magazine (Resumption Volume 2, Issue 2), it was said in the discussion on "The Abnormal State of China's Wartime Economy": "Banks and money shops in a state of financial waste are the source of usury and a fatal wound to production. This abnormal state of the economy already existed before the incident, and it has become more severe after the incident. If this state is not changed, there will be no way to fundamentally improve China's production."</p>

<p>In order to assist the government in stabilizing prices, the Central Reserve Bank recently temporarily suspended interbank lending and restricted the loan business of various financial institutions, and the lowering of prices has achieved the greatest effect. In order to repay loans, hoarders have flocked to clear their stocks, and black market prices have fallen across the board, which has hit speculators hard. In particular, the heads of firms that indiscriminately engage in speculation and pledge national goods feel even more that their short-term funds are not flexible.</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank recently learned that the so-called short-term funds of each of the firms are that they used funds to hoard goods in the past. They cannot be sold off for a while. At this time, lending is tightened, so the turnover of short-term funds is difficult and there is no problem with business losses. In order to maintain the stability of the entire financial system, it has provided short-term loans to each of the firms to support their business at its discretion. At the same time, all hoarded loans will be sold off to compensate for the loss. In the future, such firms will be banned and no short-term loans will be provided.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Deadline for Registration of Major Commodities <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Only 30% of Firewood and Soap Registered</p>
<p>The general registration of major commodities handled by the Economic Bureau of this city was originally intended to count the stored quantities of major commodities in this city in order to adjust them and prevent hoarding and speculation. It is learned that the registration will close on the 15th of this month. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be punished according to law. It is hoped that the trade associations of major commodities in this city will instruct their members to quickly register and not wait and see, lest they be punished.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the registration of matches, soap, and firewood, which the Materials Investigation Committee has adopted for the implementation of fair rationing, it has repeatedly ordered each store to register and report its inventory, and has repeatedly extended the deadline to the 9th of this month. As of today, the investigation and registration of production plants is basically complete, but only about 30% of the 6,000 retail stores in Shanghai have registered and reported their inventories, and 70% have not yet reported. It is heard that the Materials Investigation Committee will implement the measures decided by the plenary committee meeting on the 25th of last month for unregistered inventories, that is, matches, candles, and soap that have not been registered will be sealed and confiscated.</p>

<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3 id="e55">Points to Note for Long-Term Air Defense <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Since the 3rd of this month, this city has implemented long-term blackouts. Based on our observation over the past week, we offer the following points that should be noted:</p>
<p>This blackout may be more relaxed in terms of implementation and execution compared to temporary controls in the past because it is a long-term air defense measure. However, because it is slightly relaxed, many places did not pay attention and revealed lights when walking on every road around 8:00 in the evening. If this situation is not corrected, it is likely that the air defense rules will become a dead letter over time.</p>
<p>These few days—the middle of each lunar month—are just the time when the moonlight is bright. The faint light of the street lights on the road is as if there is none under the moonlight, which is a waste of electricity. We believe that street lights should be exempted during the bright moonlight period, and the electricity used for street lights should be used to supplement the lack of electricity for production.</p>
<p>After the blackout, petty criminals take the opportunity to engage in activities, and comprehensive plans should be made to prevent security problems. How can the police liaise with the Baojia self-defense groups? How should patrols be conducted? Good methods should be devised quickly.</p>
<p>There are quite a few small business people who make a living on the streets, and they should be allowed to continue to do business. From a proactive perspective, guide them to abide by air defense rules so that they can still make a living without going against air defense.</p>
<p>The above is a jumble of opinions. I hope that the relevant authorities will consider and deal with them.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Additional Fees Levied on Parcels Sent to Japan <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>

<h3 id="e58">Yesterday's Games: Central North vs. East China <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Public Basketball Tournament continues tonight at 6:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Gymnasium with four matches. In the Group B division, Robust will face Linglong, and China Storage will battle the Blue Team. In Group A, the doubleheader begins at 7:30 PM with China United versus Union, a battle between rivals. China United is the Group A champion of the Western Youth League, boasting five tigers: Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Jinye, and Wu Chengzhang. Although Union has fierce generals like Xu Jusheng, it will be difficult to blunt the edge of their elder brother. The other Group A match features Monocle against Chen You. Although Chen You is a local powerhouse at the Youth Gymnasium, their chances of victory are slim. In yesterday evening's opening Group A match, Central North faced Real China, and the game was full of highlights. In the first half, East China trailed by twelve to twenty-eight. Ultimately, Central North won with a score of fifty-six to twenty-nine. In the final match, Ren Yu played against Union Friends. Although Zhang Shaoxiang and Zhang Jiakui of Ren Yu did not play, their skills were still a cut above, easily defeating Union Friends with a score of twenty-nine to eleven.</p>
<p>Yesterday's results: French Business defeated China Film B (B4) 21-18, Three United defeated Chengfu (B1) 24-20, Central North defeated East China (A1) 56-29, Ren Yu defeated Union Friends (A2) 29-11.</p>

<p>2-1 Tense Situation</p>
<p>The White Lions small soccer team, recently organized and established, was originally scheduled to go to Wuxian, but the local organizers in Suzhou were not prepared in time, so it was temporarily canceled. To hone their skills, the team played against the Sino-Western Allied Forces yesterday at the Tongle Stadium. The audience numbered over four thousand, creating a lively atmosphere. After a twenty-minute stalemate, Feng Dunxiang took a free kick, delivering a powerful shot. Fei Chunhua was perfectly positioned and broke the deadlock. The White Lions led 1-0 in the first half. After the break, the Allied Forces tried to retaliate, but the White Lions' defense was solid, making it difficult to advance. Fei Chunhua returned, scoring a second goal. With the Allied Forces losing two goals in a row, the game became more intense. White Lion Feng Dunxiang, eager to save the ball, crashed into Bao Jie in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Jin Lusheng of the Allied Forces took the penalty and scored. In the end, the White Lions defeated the Sino-Western Allied Forces 2-1, achieving a successful start.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Another Failed Operation in Burma: British and Americans Unable to Counterattack <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Army Press Department Spokesman</p>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai announced the latest situation in Burma and the future development of the Burmese campaign, as well as an analysis of the anti-Axis counteroffensive capabilities, at the routine press conference yesterday (8th). Details are as follows: The Burmese Campaign is Divided into Three Areas</p>
<p>The Burmese campaign area is divided into three sections: Arakan, Kaladan, and the Hukawng Valley. In the Arakan sector, the anti-Axis forces, the British-Indian 7th and 5th Divisions, were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army. The British-Indian 7th Division has been completely annihilated, and two-thirds of the 5th Division has been eliminated. The results of this battle include 7,000 enemy corpses left behind, of which 3,000 were British soldiers, 600 prisoners, and captured war trophies including 92 artillery pieces, 600 tanks and trucks, and 62 aircraft shot down. The strength of a British-Indian division is estimated at 22,000, so judging from the enemy's manpower losses, it is clear that the enemy has suffered considerable damage. Not only in terms of manpower, but also in terms of material resources, the enemy is about to be completely eliminated. Therefore, in the Arakan campaign, the enemy's failure is evident, and the Japanese army has achieved absolute victory. The Kaladan battle situation: a brigade of indigenous West African troops advanced southward along the riverbank. The Japanese army gave them a head-on blow. The Hukawng Valley area of northern Burma: the Japanese army is facing the Nationalist Expeditionary Force in Burma across the Tarong River. Recently, the Nationalist army, fearing the Japanese advance, has built solid defensive positions in the Cangjiang area within India, attempting to transfer the main Nationalist forces to the north bank of the Tarong River. In the Myitkyina area north of Lashio in Yunnan-Burma, the Japanese army is preparing to launch an annihilation battle against the enemy there, and has adopted an active offensive. Battle is imminent. In the above-mentioned three areas of operation, the enemy's forces were all isolated battles, without any connection, and the situation is already unfavorable.</p>
<p>British Troops Fearful, Criticized by Americans and Nationalists</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesman continued to analyze the extent of the development of the Burmese campaign, first citing the contents of recent foreign telegrams, saying: "In the second Arakan campaign, British Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram of congratulations to Lord Mountbatten, the person in charge of Southeast Asia Command." The spokesman then analyzed this situation, saying that the enemy, suffering annihilation, feared shaking public morale. For the sake of stability and cover-up, this kind of pretense to East Asia and Japan is not only not surprising, but also no different from the situation at Dunkirk. Therefore, this tactic of covering up the facts has caused dissatisfaction from both the Americans and the Nationalists. Furthermore, according to a Washington dispatch on the 5th, well-informed American sources believe that the current India-Burma war is nothing more than a defensive war, and its intention is to coldly dismiss Churchill's congratulatory telegram, considering it a joke. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the United Press correspondent in Chongqing, Nationalist newspapers pointed out that the failure of the India-Burma campaign was due to the conflicting operational opinions of Stilwell and Mountbatten. Furthermore, according to a Western newspaper published in Chongqing on the 6th, it was actually the British who feared the Japanese army, and Mountbatten insisted on waiting for the arrival of assistance from the fleet before launching operations, so the Americans expressed deep dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Counterattack Against Japan Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesman also said that recently, Nationalist Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, in his report on the military situation at the Nationalist Executive Yuan meeting, boasted that a major offensive would be launched against Japan on the Yunnan-Burma border in early March. We believe that this is absolutely impossible, because the rainy season will soon arrive in Burma, and it will be difficult for the Nationalists to counterattack this year. Also, regarding the proposal by Nimitz, MacArthur, and Sinor to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for attacking Japan, although recent observations show that they have a tendency to prepare for action, it is still difficult to become a reality. In short, in order to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for a counterattack against Japan, Burma must first be recaptured. At the same time, Nimitz and MacArthur's other proposal to first break through the central Pacific and then use the Nationalist mainland as a base is nothing short of a pie in the sky, and if it is to be implemented, it will take a long time. Looking back at the Russo-Japanese War and the Baltic Sea campaign, and based on the current situation, an anti-Axis counterattack is practically impossible. The Japanese spokesman then pointed to an interesting story published by Warren Atherton, the commander of the American soldiers who participated in the first European War, saying that based on the current ratio, if the American army were to attack Japan, it would have to prepare 3 million troops. Secondly, he referred to the recent statement by British Aircraft Production Minister Stafford Cripps, saying that the attack on Japan was a very distant goal, and that in order to push back the Japanese army, which currently occupies a large territory, even more effort must be made. From this, it is clear that the anti-Axis powers cannot launch a counterattack against Japan, and the opinions of the British and Americans themselves are also different.</p>
<p>Nationalist-Communist Conflicts Cannot Be Resolved</p>
<p>According to British newspapers, at the last Cairo Conference, Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist government recounted many of the difficulties faced by the Nationalist side, including the need to resolve the Communist issue within the Nationalist government before the Nationalist mainland could be used as a base for a counterattack against Japan. The opinions of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang were unanimous. At the same time, Chiang explained the strength of the Nationalist Communist Party, saying that the Nationalist Communist Party had 400,000 members entrenched, who ostensibly claimed to be conducting guerrilla warfare, but in reality provided no assistance to the Nationalist government and disrupted the rear on the periphery. Chiang also said that if the Communist forces still exist after the end of the European and Asian wars, China will suffer even greater danger. The Japanese spokesman then explained that, from this point of view, it is undoubtedly difficult to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for attacking Japan. Furthermore, Chiang's resolution of the Communist issue is useless. Recent reports of the breakdown of Nationalist-Communist negotiations, even if there is a possibility of further negotiations, may be difficult to resolve. Moreover, the Nationalist and Communist forces recently engaged in fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang Province.</p>

<h3 id="e61">In this Festive Season, Set Aside Gambling Money to Help Students: Mr. Huang Yuzhai First to Propose <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuzhai sent a letter yesterday stating: "In recent years, gambling has been rampant in Shanghai. During New Year celebrations and weekends, the sound of mahjong tiles can be heard in many households. Some even sink into gambling dens, lingering and forgetting to return home, resulting in empty pockets and heavy debts, and even losing their homes. At a time when war is raging and disasters are looming, it is disheartening to see such a decline in morals and such a failure to wake up. I have never been involved in gambling myself. Although many guests gather during the New Year, after tea and wine, we only engage in pleasant conversations. If friends invite me to play a game, I politely decline. I once suggested to friends that they set aside some of their gambling money during this festive season, treating it as if they had already lost it, and use it to help with relief efforts and student loans. The recipients would be grateful forever, and the donors would not have wasted their money, and could find solace in their hearts at night. Therefore, without considering my own insignificance, I am the first to propose this. I have raised a total of 50,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to donating 10,000 yuan each to the Renji Hospital, the Zheshao Hospital, the Shaoxing Middle School, and the Xinpu Yutang, I am now sending a bank draft from the head office of the Bank of China for 10,000 yuan in national currency, to be donated to your newspaper's student loan fund. I sincerely hope that people in society will take my humble suggestion and try to emulate it, helping students and nurturing talent. This will benefit the country and society, and I will be forever grateful."</p>

<p>Pushan Villa was founded in the second year of the Republic of China by Mr. Wang Junsheng and his colleagues, who raised funds to establish it. It specializes in collecting unclaimed coffins of travelers and abandoned corpses of children. For those who died without being buried, it also provides coffins. Later, houses were built on Shanshan Road in Zhabei, and in the ninth year of the Republic, Pushan Hospital was established to provide medical care and medicine to the poor. Subsequently, a head office was established on Beihai Road, and branch offices were established in the Pudong districts of the South City. Since its establishment, it has collected 771,379 large and small corpses, and distributed 267,014 large and small coffins. Currently, materials and labor costs are unusually expensive, especially the wood required for coffins. Before the war, it was only five or six yuan, but now it has increased more than 200 times. The villa has no dedicated funds and has to ask artists from the entertainment industry to perform on the radio to raise funds. It will be held at the French radio station on March 15th and 16th, starting at 2:00 PM. The fundraising target is 500,000 yuan. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously and support this cause.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Commemorating Women's Day: Launching the Women's Light Society to Promote Women's Welfare <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The social service department of this newspaper convened female doctors, teachers, artists, and others, including Zhou Shuliang, Liu Baizhi, Zheng Xufan, Li Qinglian, Huang Guifang, Ye Taihua, Hu Weiqing, Fang Jinying, and Yu Xiangmei, yesterday, March 8th, Women's Day, to discuss the issue of women's responsibility. They believe that women should serve the people together with men and enhance the strength of the people. The mobilization of women during wartime is a temporary phenomenon, but it is obvious that it is no longer sufficient for women to only seek to be good wives and mothers. Due to the experience of today's war, whether for the country or for the family, it is inevitable that women must step out of the kitchen or at least not remain permanently confined within the family in the future. Before marriage and after their children have grown up, women have considerable time to serve society. The country will suddenly increase such human resources, which will also increase wealth. This is most needed in China, which has long suffered from poverty. Since women are members of the nation, they can naturally exert the power of their one member and fulfill the responsibility of their one member. The Women's Light Society was launched on the spot, with the aim of promoting women's welfare, starting with assistance to out-of-school girls, vocational guidance, production education, domestic research, relief for the poor and sick, and legal protection.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Navy <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Wind and Waves (5)</p>
<p>Naval academy vacations are famously short, and soon Masato had to prepare to return to school.</p>
<p>Although this short vacation felt like it had loosened all the muscles in his body, he actually hoped to return to Etajima sooner. Also, his mother was healthier than he had imagined, and thanks to Shikogoro's hard work, the store was doing well. His older brother was in Tokyo, and his second brother, Shin'ichiro, was working in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, strengthening the foundation of the family. Therefore, Masato did not need to worry about his hometown.</p>
<p>The only thing he couldn't let go of was the matter of his good friend, Takao.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he visited the Mukota family several times, but never met Takao. With tears in her eyes, his mother told him: "He's been acting like he's gone mad. He doesn't talk to anyone in the family. He doesn't eat much either— It's really too pessimistic." But Masato had no words of comfort to offer.</p>
<p>Honestly, when we think of the pain in Takao's heart, there's no reason why Takao wouldn't go mad. Since elementary school, he had dreamed of the "Navy" like that. And after failing last year, he hadn't abandoned his dream of the military branch, still relying on this ray of hope in the business branch. But even this last hope was cut off, so it's no wonder he's gone mad. Why is fate so cruel to Takao alone? Takao was the first to aspire to the Navy. He, who was originally going to be a banker, became a naval student, while Takao, who so longed for the "Navy," was plunged into the abyss of despair——</p>
<p>(Fate is a terrible thing!) When Masato was alone, thinking of Takao's situation, he wiped away tears with his own hand.</p>
<p>The day before returning to school, on the way back from visiting the Tōgō cemetery and the Nanzhou Shrine, he visited the personnel section chief's office at the city hall, seeking Takao's father. Because he couldn't see Takao, he had no choice but to see his father.</p>
<p>"Oh! —Thank goodness, he seems to be a little calmer."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Masato was overjoyed. According to his father, Takao had asked his father to go to the Kirishima hot springs to recuperate his broken body and mind.</p>
<p>"If he can rest for a month, he should be able to recover from this shock."</p>
<p>Masato knew that the wounds suffered by friends and family could not be easily healed, but he could only pray that the air of the quiet Kirishima mountains would give Takao a starting point for reflection and hope. The fact that he himself had proposed this condition also proved that his despair had exceeded its extreme.</p>
<p>"The pneumonia he had as a child, I never thought it would still be bothering him now,"</p>
<p>Takao's father said as he saw Masato out.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Masato got off the train at Miyajima Station, gathered at the place designated by the school, and returned to school with many classmates on the school's motorboat.</p>
<p>At the moment he saw Mount Furataka, the mooring training ship, and the appearance of the student hall, he felt tension in his body, and the worries or joys of the so-called "secular world" had flown away to who knows where.</p>
<p>From the next day, that spirited and disciplined life began again. In mid-September, it was still the summer curriculum, but the calm sea of Etajima was becoming increasingly deep blue, and the cold water bath in the early morning sometimes felt chilling to the heart. However, the scenery on the excessively beautiful island, although autumn was about to arrive, was not outwardly visible.</p>
<p>Masato and the others had already completed one semester, so they were no longer new fourth-year students. The salutes to the instructors and upperclassmen were also done almost reflexively. Terms such as "you" and "I" were also used very naturally. And hearing that an excursion to Mount Misen and Haramura would be held during the autumn semester particularly aroused their interest.</p>
<p>Starting from the new semester, Masato especially worked hard on his judo studies. Because he had been most proficient in judo since middle school, he hoped to achieve something in the future, at least to obtain the first dan before graduation. The dojo at the naval academy was very large, both in judo and swordsmanship, so the students boasted that it was "the best in the world." The intensity of the training there was probably also the best in the world. It was not something that could be imagined by terms such as doing homework, but had a spirit of dying for it. Among them, Masato's seriousness was special. The judo instructor at the time, Usabuchi, a seventh dan who had been hired from Kodokan, still remembered the situation at the time. It is said that Masato always chose opponents who were better than himself, and his attitude towards teaching was also very active.</p>
