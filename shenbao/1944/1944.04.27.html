<p>社評</p>
<h3>流民移墾</h3>
<p>我們在街頭散步之際，常有鳩形鵠面的同胞尾隨求乞，察其年齡，頗有正在盛壯之歲者。輪埠車站，更多遊手好閒之徒，賊頭賊腦，作巧取豪奪勾當。近來乘黑夜刦奪，遭擒落網者，類多年富力强之輩。試加細思，如謂若輩甘心墮落或犯法，似亦未必。大部分因受生活所迫，挺而走險，自為原因之一。如果從這觀點推想，則消滅促使挺而走險的原因，亟須根本研究而實施。</p>
<p>在犯罪學上分析，質窮為犯罪原因之一，如欲防止犯罪之增多，救濟貧窮頗為重要。所以，「貧窮」是目前上海一部分犯罪者之犯罪原因。則救濟貧窮，不僅博愛的慈善事業，且為防止犯罪的積極要圖。</p>
<p>我們假定目前上海有上面所說的三種人，姑且稱之為流民，應該予以救濟的。第一種是鳩形酷面的乞丐。第二種是遊手好閒的小偷。第三種是黑夜行刦的暴徒。前兩種人，但是多是從前兩種人一變而成的。所以，對於前兩種人加以澈底的救濟，後一種人自然也會減少。</p>
<p>然則，救濟的責任究由誰來負擔呢？當然，政府應負倡導責任，社會應盡協助義務·救濟的方式，我們認為不是消極的收容，而是積極的使之生產，使之自食其力。因為收容，需費浩繁，如因經費不繼而解散，還是不能澈底的。惟有妥籌簡便易行的生產方法，強制勒令从事生产工作，施以严格管理。一方面在難民本人可以自立營生，一方面在上海市容可以整飭，犯罪案件可以减少，從而確保社會安寗，更是莫大的收穫。</p>
<p>於此，我們建議採用「難民移墾」的辦法，这裏所謂「移墾」，不需要大規模的經濟，移墾區域，不是遼遠的邊區。我們主張就上海近郊所有荒地闢為流民墾區，將上海市內所有乞丐，除去老弱幼孺之外，悉數强制集中。將所有碼頭輪埠等地遊手好閒之徒，無正當職業之輩，悉數强制集中，載運離沪，安置一地或数地，施以短期农作技能，使之擔任耕作·如果荒地不多，則可幫助附近農家耕作，或做長工。</p>
<p>我們希望上海市政府府及社會福利部主持其事，調查郊外荒地，妥籌實施方法。市民福利協會從旁協助，警察局擔任强制移民工作。分工合作，以底於成。</p>
<p>增加生產，目前已經是天經地義的口號了，利用荒地，增加農產，增加食糧，自然是切要之舉·確保治安，革新上海，是目前上海市政府常局所懸的目標，則移殖流民，使社會减少犯罪案件，使治安得到一部分確保之方，更是一舉數善兼具，幸亟起圖之。</p>
<h3>南北間匯兌限制　下月起完全取消　實現各地區資金自由交流</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　關於南北間之匯兌問題，以往因種種關係，未能暢通，且限制頗嚴，此於人民經濟以及金融調節物資交流等各方面，均有莫大影響。國府財政當局，有鑒於此，乃力謀改善之策。自去年四月一日，盟邦方面為協助吾完成幣制統一施策，而毅然自行停止其軍票新發行後，當局即首先確定中儲劵聯銀券之比率，規定為中儲券百元對聯銀券十八元之比率。及至去年十二月一日起，更將中備券擴展流通，至淮海地區，與聯銀券一併行使。本年四月十日起至三十日止，更規定淮海地區中儲券與聯銀券之限期全面交換，此外又重行改訂南北間人民携帶紙幣辦法，將原定限額酌予提高，更為取締聯銀券在華中各地（尤其上海）之黑市價格，而期穩定整個金融體制起見，更在上海指定十七家銀行，專理中儲券與聯銀券交換手續。凡此種種，均為當局調節南北金融之重大措置也。實施以來，於國府整個之金融調節，曁南北物資之交流上，均得莫大助益。茲者，當局為貫徹旣定方策，促過更進一步之圓滑進展起見，乃決定於五月一日起，將南北間之匯兌限制，予以完全取消，今後可無限制自由通匯。此舉不論於政府之金融施策，人民之經濟活動，與夫南北間之物資交流等，種種措施上，實均具有劃期之深長意義。故消息傳出，南北民衆，對政府無不寄予更深切而熱烈之信賴，其有助於國府戰時經濟體制之完成，及大東亞共榮難設之遂行者，至鉅且大。深信此舉實行後，定可收下列數點之偉大成果，是可預卜。　今後中儲券與聯銀券之交流，定將更形圓滑，則此於中儲券之信用及流通範圍上，均有重大意義。　南北之民間經濟，今後亦將因取消匯兌限制，而更趨於活潑，此於整個國家經濟建設前途，有深切影響。　國府之調節金融施策，得有另一展開，收取劃期成果，而完成其預定目標。　今後之南北物資交流，亦將因此而更趨圓滑，此於國府抑平物價，安定民生之大前提下，更有深長之意義也。</p>
<h3>日大使館周財長均發表談話</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電日　大使館，二十六日就對舉北地區匯兌，堅持百元對十八元之比率，發表談話如次：國民政府對於華北地區匯兌，向來堅持儲備劵百元對聯合券十八元之方針，此次撤廢對華北方面一般匯兌限制，自五月一日起，實施自由無限制匯兌，華北方面亦採取同樣揹置，以期兩地間正常資金能圓滑交流。過去日本政府關於備備券聯合券等中國各通貨，對日本圓現行匯兌換算率，堅持旣定方針，並施行各項施策，以期强力支持中國之通貨政策。國府此次措置，即為適應日本政府之方針，使今後中國南北兩地之經濟，更形緊密。對於中國經濟建設，以及完遂大東亞戰爭，頗有貢獻，實堪欣快。</p>
<p>財政部長談話　中央備備銀行券及中國聯合準備銀行券，在和平區城內夙為南北之唯一通貨，深得人民信仰。而於物資流通及金融調節，相亙之問，尤為便利。近自淮海省通貨制度，經政府迭次一加以調整，並繼續强力推行，所有南北之匯兌交易，巳漸見圓滑。政府對於中央儲備銀行券與中國聯合準備銀行券之兌換率，仍堅持一百元對十八元之方針，俾其始終穩定。至一般匯兌情形，前以鑒於實際情況，曾將南北間匯兌限制提高至五千元，以應需要。現為　全人民便利起見、特將前項匯款限制，自五月一日起，予以廢止，並對於中儲與聯銀券一百元對十八元之比率，槪不稍有變更，仍舊監持。此後匯兌上正常之交易，一任自由，其含有投機性之資金移動，則仍照過去情形，嚴加取締·深信將來南北物資交流，資金調節，必更趨圓滑。即其經濟關係，亦將因此而更呈緊密化也。務望各體斯旨，一致協助，以觀　成，是為至盼。如有因作投機性交易，自　法綱，政府亦決不款貨，並希注意為要。</p>

<p>南京二十五日中央社電　司法行政部為使將來治外法權撤廢後之司法權，運用完滿，曾於去年冬組織法規編修委員會，研究改善中國之司法制度，並擬聘請盟邦司法界名宿，任法規編修委員會顧問。經愼重銓衢結果，乃聘請日大審院推事，法學傳士久禮田氏為該會顧問。氏已於日前抵京就任，幷設立事務所於西康路三號，開始辦公。</p>

<p>北平二十六日中央社電　華北新聞會茲為適應時局，决定合併北京天津地區各報紙，定於五月一日，新設華北新報社，創刋華北新報。同進即時現在北京之新民報，實報，民衆報，天津之庸寶，天津報，一律停刋。新設立之華北新報社，設總社於北平，去社於天津，各於兩地發行名稱相同之報紙。</p>
<h3>淮省儲券聯銀交換成績良好</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　財政部為統一淮海省內幣制，特定於上年十二月一日起，開始在該省使用中儲券，實施以來，對金融之穩定，物價之平衡，均有莫大功效。因之止，實行以百元對十八元比率，與聯銀券全面交換。財部方面前為督導及明瞭全面交換情形，會派該部專員胡延禧赴該省視察，刻該員已將視察結果，呈報到部。據悉，淮省財政廳，中儲分行，及各有關機關之協助交換工作，極為順利，故成績甚良好</p>

<h3>日靖國神社舉行第五次臨時大祭　日皇陛下親臨禮拜英靈</h3>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電旅日回敎徒主　伊布拉西穆，發表聲明稱：耶路撒冷之回教徒大主教菲塞尼，　向全世界回教徒呼籲一致奮起，報戈協力日印軍討伐暴戾之英。一美，現東亞全回教徒巳奮奮起策應此舉，極堪注目。伊布拉西穆至教，久悲憤英。美之侵略西亞，認為亞洲如無日本，決不能復典，故葉儘其一生之精力於復興亞洲之事業，現印度之獨立運動已具强力之武力組織，印度之亞洲回教徒各民族，現正連合向郁放之天道邁進。今日之郁放機會，實為全回敎徒所雖逢，蓋軸心國對侵略者之英·美宣戰，適與回敎徒之宗教義務相同，我等回敎徒於參加軸心國之戰爭時，全面敎徒之和平與自由福社，當可完全獲得也。東亞即馬來，爪哇，蘇門答臘之全體回教徒同胞，於此次大東亞戰爭中，已驅逐英美勢力，恢復其希望與自由，印度回敎徒諸君，請即策應日印軍，速為自由與和平而戰。西亞之回教徒諸君，軸心國之武力壓迫，已使英一美極為狼狽，彼等於愴惶之餘，乃將巴勒斯坦聖地委之於猶太人手中，此聖地將為資本主義之毒牙所　賣，彼等之悖德，彼等之內部矛盾，乃彼等帝國主義之末期症狀，現已暴露無遺。回教徒對於彼等之壓迫回敎與剝奪自由，斷然與之抗爭，現在已獲各解放之東亞回教徒一億二千萬人及現得解放之印度回教徒八千萬人，與西亞一諸君一億人協力時，回教徒各民族之解放，即將速速實現也。余以九十五歲之　齡，得覩回敎徒解放之實現，衷心極感愉快。</p>

<h3>英美對葡　施經濟壓迫</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：英美政府要求葡萄牙與德停止實易之說，引起若干謠傳，官方亦未發表正式聲明，致民間無從獲知。最近葡總理　拉柴曾與英駐葡大使康貝爾為士及商務部長杜克會談多次，葡人均熟知本國仰賴英美供給大量穀物煤及其他燃料，此種重要輸入品一旦中斷，則葡國將遭極大困雖。</p>

<h3>開闢第二戰綫　德方之觀察　軍運頻繁遲早必實現</h3>
<p>柏林廿六日中央社電　最近因第二戰綫問題甚器塵上，致使歐洲空氣益形緊張。至於第二戰綫是否實現，依吾人判斷，反軸心罩為使蘇聯網績共同“作戰起見，必須不避一切犧牲，造成第二戰綫。最近反軸心軍隊及兵艦往來英領益見頻繁，且英倫南部已有大批運輸艦集中，地中海方面之登陸用舟艇亦相繼開往英國，現駐義之具有登陸作戰經騐之美指揮官亦先後赴英，且美國運日以大批軍隊及資材運送至英，此均係實施登陸之準備，故此次反軸心軍之第二戰錢必將實踐，究非一年前之虛偽宣傳所可同日而茲也。然反軸心軍究在何時以何方法及在何處登陸，實有研究之必要。其</p>
<p>登　地點</p>
<p>不外布列塔尼半島，法岸，及地中海南岸等地，此等地點之登陸作戰，其自的在分散及牽制德軍兵力，，至其眞正進攻大陸作戰，必須選擇距離英領最近之地點，故必定利用杜佛海峽，此皆根據軍事知織之推測也。</p>
<p>其次登陸可能地點，即挪威南部或丹麥瑞典等國，在此處登陸後建立空德東北部直搗德國心臟。此種戰法以軍事眼光觀察，反軸心軍頗有採用之可進攻中歐致政治的意味，一方更可迴避大西洋岸而襲擊德國背後，同時可減少士兵之犧牲，而利用物質之優勢，倘採用上項戰術，反軸心軍似必先强迫瑞典參戰。至於</p>
<p>作戰方法</p>
<p>亦將沿用太平洋之戰術，最先以大批空軍反復轟炸，使德空軍及海岸防綫破壞，完全把握西歐之制海制空權，繼以登陸舟艇一舉齊進，使數師團之兵力同時登陸，幷以降落傘部隊大批降落，堅守各處登陸據點，然後再將待機於英國之大批反軸心軍隊直接登陸，繼續擴展登陸據點，展開正面作戰形勢。然而德國一年來海岸防禦工事之建築極爲驚人，據英空軍偵察結果，海岸綫之高射砲配備竟達五萬門之多，故空軍之活動頗感困難，且各要衆均有充分準備，數個月中可不恃外問輸人給養，亦能繼續作戰，故以常識推測，奪取德海津據點實屬不可能。又美衆院陸委會會報告稱，登陸作戰之最初一月，須犧牲七萬五千人，實為一可怕數字，由此觀之，反軸心軍欲在法北部海岸登陸，非有　大致軍事準備不為功。</p>
<p>時期推測</p>
<p>至於登陸作戰之時期間題，反軸心方面之宣傳謂最近將開始，德方亦聲明無論何時何地上陸，德軍巳有萬全匯備。然據西班牙報紙及里斯本電報均稱登陸作戰時機未至，或將遷延至本年秋季。其理由謂，目下德軍尚有預料以上之兵力，問時反軸心之準備亦未完成，反軸心軍登陸作戰，首先須獲得在德國之制空權，故本年初反軸心軍會致力於轟炸德國飛機塲，然而最近美陸長史汀生亦承認德空軍力又吿增强。當然德飛機工業所受損害亦頗可觀，但自去年起始決在各地建設多處耐火工塲，其增產計劃亦漸人正戰，生產率校一年前更形增加。自他方觀之，反軸心軍之登陸兵力約有十五師至三十師，雖不能謂少，但一師兵力之輸送，需耍三十萬噸之船艦，在義南部輸送困難之地實成一大問題，故雖然反軸心軍正集中精力準備登陸作戰，但船舶頗成問題也。</p>
<h3>糧食問題治本治治標商榷</h3>
<p>— 裕農</p>
<p>國以民為木，民以食為天，民食所關，安危繫之。而値此大東亞戰爭決戰時間，前方軍需之供給，與後方權秩序之安定，全在食糧有充分之籌備，而後乃可不致方秩序之安定，全在貪糧查江浙皖三省人口約有一意一千萬之衆，凡中農民居百分之八十，士工商約居百分之廿。以平時三省產米數量計之，已苦不足，自東變以後，交通旣有阻滯，治權又不統一，產量日漸減少，供應尤處不繼。蓋浙江一省，浙東產米，向稱不是，必賴湘贛南洋各地米糧之接濟現在南洋湘贛交通阻隔，挹注無從，浙東產米數量雖豐，目前又無法前往採辦，蘇皖兩省又非完全產米之區，（六成產雜糧，四成產米，）八千八百萬之農民固可自耕自食，而二千二百萬之士工商人，則均須仰賴於農民之給養，其不足之數目不待言。茲以每日每口平均以七合計之，月需米二斗一升，以二千二百萬人計之，月約需米四百六十二萬石，一年之需約在五千五百四十四萬石，（每石約一百六十斤，十石為一噸，共計需米五百五十四萬噸。）益以盟邦軍隊給養，約年需三十萬噸，總共年需五百八十四萬噸。而調查政府現在統治三省各區產米量，統計每年約有七百萬噸之譜，除去農民自食之米五百六十萬噸，及盟邦軍隊給養外，所餘僅僅有一百十萬噸，兩比尚短四百七十四萬噸之　。若不速謀補救之方，則禍變之來，勢將莫由推測。鄙見以為補救之策，必須標本兼治，庶可應付裕如。誰貢一得之愚，尚希釆納是幸。</p>
<p>（甲）治木</p>
<p>裁撤各種採辦米糧機關，溯自食糧統制以來，採購機關名目　多，承轟旣繁，剝削不免，而舞弊中飽，又層出不窮，以致司農仰屋，軍民咨嗟，計不如一律裁撤，由政府與人民直接合作，自由採購，規定由蘇浙皖之省政府，責成各縣政府與地方商會暨保甲處合作，定價收買。政府旣可節縮鉅太政費之開支，而農民亦可減免層層壓迫之痛苦，預料收買之成續，必較統制機關為便利也。</p>
<p>獎勵農民增加生產頻年以來，　　遍地，鄉農不能安居樂業，重以雜稅　捐，不堪其擾，每歲收獲已不能自給，而新殼登塲之後，政府收買限價低廉成本損失，尤不可預計，以致相率輟耕，甚至有改種他物者，若不速予獎勵耕種，恐人造災荒立將發見矣。獎勵之法，宜速舉辦輕利農貸，於播種之前，貸給本金，扶助生產，或於新穀登塲，聽農民自由賣給商會，俾得現金，以資周轉。如農民樂予預拋者，准其隨時與商會訂約，任農民之自由，不加分毫之强迫。惟貸出之款，必以釆穀為擔保，其辦法另訂之。</p>
<p>農田肥料免除捐稅農民耕糧需賴肥料培養，比歲以來，肥料高漲，加以運輸困難，捐稅重疊，成本旣鉅，貧農即無力購買因之而產量減少。現在政府如能明令頒布，對於農田肥料運輸，准予暢通，並鐲免一切苛捐雜稅，以廣肥料來源，是亦補助農民耕作促進生產之一法也。</p>
<p>提高產區米價政府收買　查德國農政對於保障農民生產辦法，至為周密，如國外運來食糧，假定價目每斤八角者，而政府收買國內自產之糧食時，則故意提高三角，懸價元一角收買。農民獲此保障，無不樂於耕種，故其農產日增，民生日　。此次大戰，國內糧食不致缺乏者，賴有此也。在此戰爭時期，若仿而行之，將產區米價提高，澦定收買標準，通知各地鄉農，吾知必踴躍輸將也。</p>
<p>以上各節為治木之綱要，惟念決戰時期，軍食之壽維，人民之需要，均屬刻不容緩。値此靑黃不接之際，米價旣無法遏制，而各地存穀現在尚有若干，苦不能知其確數，調　籌維，實感困難。茲為急則治標計，約舉數端，以供研討。</p>
<p>廢除關卡自由販運上海米價與內地米價比較，恒超過一倍以上，如產米之區售價二千元，上海則售四千元至四千五百元，相差之數甚鉅。推厥其故，率由沿途關卡太多，留難剝削，費用較鉅，加以運費及米販佣金，若不增加米價，其蝕本即無處補償。如政府能毅然廢除各種關卡，明令禁止勒索留難，指定區域，任聽米商自由販運，米價必可立即低廉，而上海米荒　可不致如澦料之嚴重也。</p>
<p>配足民食杜絕黑市米價來源果能充足，則人民恐慌之心理必可解除，而備糧風積者，因無利可圖，亦自然減少。蓋配給制度其法至美，而配給不足，亦可以間接促成黑市之囂張。就現在配給每口之數量計之，尚不足十日之飽，人民迫不得已，始爭購黑市之米，而黑市之米，因承受者旣衆，於是逐漸抬高，而人民益不堪其苦矣。補救之策，似宜將配給數量酌予增加，每口至少月給二斗，配給旣足，人民不必再仰給於黑市，而黑市之米不杜絕而自杜絕矣。</p>
<p>提高米價吸收農民食米　在上海平時侮日銷米約一萬石左右，月需三十萬石，連開往外埠輸船客米在內，現在人口雖然激增，而輸船客米則較昔日減少，此項減少之不，可抵住戶之食。核計總數仍不超三十萬石，以十石為一噸計之，每月僅需三萬噸。全年共需米二十六萬噸，茲為解除上海一隅民食恐慌起見，宜從速將產區所餘一百十萬噸之米，設法提高米價，吸收運申，並將所有關卡勒索留難之弊，實行革除，運到之後，米價必不致過貴，如吸收之數不足，亦可用雜種配給補足，以符每日每口七合之數·人民日食旣足，自然不必再仰給於黑市，而米價自趨平衡，且三省產米旣有七百萬噸之鉅，甚民自食之米已佔去五百六十萬噸，果得價而沽，農民必能自願摻食雜糧，而將自食之米出售，轉移之間，上海米荒不難解除，此策之最善者也。</p>
<p>總之政府收買米糧，無論在何種時期，必須聽取人民之意思，與人民切實合作，而在此戰爭時代，尤必使人民徹低了解政府之國策，死心塌地，與政府共休戚，以切困難，自然迎刃而解。查去年新穀登塲之際，官價限制二百八十元一石，而上海售價每石至八百元之鉅，採辦官吏，雷厲風行，强迫收買，農民飲泣呑聲，無可吿訴，而貪官汚吏，又乘機以圖利中飽。農民旣感受此種痛苦，加以肥料成本太鉅，經年辛苦耕耘之所獲，竟至不保成本，而又有苛捐雜稅之擾，棄田不耕者比比皆是，似此情形，軍需民食前金之恐慌，何堪設想也。猶憶俄國大革命之後，政府收買糧食，因限價低廉，農民相率逃避，多數田地無人耕種，政府雖有峻法嚴刑，無法强制農民復耕，以致造成空前之災荒，此不能與人民合作之反響，宜人民之怨對不願為之氓矣，夫限價强制收買，俄國行之而失敗，似不宜再蹈其復　，故鄙見主張仿照德國保障農民辦法，獎勵生產，以堅强大東亞決戰之實力。一面政府與人民之間，謀切實合作，無稍隔閡，乘此尚未播種之時，從述佈吿農民，安心耕作，一面頒布獎勵辦法，以激勵農民之興趣，並明令廢除勒留難之閱卡，則目前之困難，庶可解除於一二，而未來之生產，亦可切其增加，此實標本兼治之策也。</p>

<p>代評</p>
<h3>願一致改革習</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>社會習俗，婚喪喜慶，趨尚奢糜，由來已久，雖在此戰時，提倡節約之際，而依然豪華，甚且有超過平時者，實應共記改革，挽回風尚。我個人管見以爲：</p>
<p>喜慶婚喪之事，原為一人一家之私事，在友誼關係，　慶或弔唁固無不可，但絕不應着眼於物質的眩耀上。諺云：「人到禮不到」，確是比較餽贈厚禮爲有意義。現在交通不便，人事繁忙者，即「人亦不到」，似亦無妨。</p>
<p>實際的說，目前一般餽贈禮儀，大都糟塌浪費，譬如花籃花圈，金字幛軸，盡是不合實用。甚至包紮之紅紙也是糟塌，徒耗物力。因此，更張不主送禮物。</p>
<p>近時比較進步的，採用折現為善辦法，利用喜慶機會，餽禮折收現金，以之捐移公益業事，一面不加舖張，誠不失為兩得之舉。可是，實際上，很多一面折現為善，一面却仍大事舖張。此外，餽禮折現一事，也應附有條件，譬如六七十歲以上的壽慶，共本人或後輩巳有事業成就，對於國家社會有所貢默者，方足當此。</p>
<p>凡友朋之境况困難者，遇有婚喪大事，應送現金，數目特厚，表示互助之意。</p>
<p>以上數點，基於個人接觸社會所發生之感想。尤以最近將爲小兒結婚，承親友紛粉垂問日期，更覺不能自安。以言隨俗舖張，與個人向來主張戰時節約大相逕庭，自屬不可，以守言行一致之旨；以言受禮折現貢獻於公益，則個人資望旣不足當，而兒輩婚事更非長輩壽慶可比，尤不敢當。但兒女婚事，事實上有不能由個人或單方主張者，於此，誠懇請求親友不送賀禮，不敢勞駕，縱承致送賀禮，亦絕不敢接受，如承枉駕光臨，亦不準備招待，附帶聲明，敬祈愛護奢曲加垂諒。</p>
<h3>老閘區居住證　定日內換發</h3>
<p>本市第一區居住證調換辦法，業經第一局保甲區呈准市府於本月起，開始在舊一區及滬西新併區，由各分局保甲股分別負責，按保辦理。居民於得到保長通知後，即準時至各該管分局保甲股辦理按捺指紋等申請調換手續。老閘區保甲股第一批居住證，業已辦竣，將於日內通知各保甲長轉知居民持原市民證向該股調換新居住證，居民於接獲通知後，即須按時調換，以捷手續，以便分批順利辦竣。</p>
<h3>市糧局獎勵　領荒懇植</h3>
<p>本市糧食局為積極增裕農業生產起見，奉令關於木市近郊及農村各處休閒荒廢士地，儘量開拓，爰經該局成立休閒荒廢土地調查團，獎勵市民領荒貇植，特呈奉市府核准施行，凡從未墾種之可墾土地，與前曾懇種現已拋荒之地，及不堪居住之廢屋基地，與荒塚地等，自即日起可自動逕向木市糧局呈請領荒承墾，市府當予以墾荒之優先權益，藉以鼓勵農業生產，增裕國力。</p>
<h3>小倉顧問昨分訪　盟邦軍政長官　今日應各界歡迎茶會</h3>
<p>新任國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，於日前來滬後，昨日特分別拜訪駐滬日本大使館領事館，以及陸海軍當局長官，作履新後之初次訪問。今（二十七）日下午四時在華懋飯店應中日當局之歡迎茶會，聞本市金融工商各界團體，亦定期舉行茶會熟烈觀迎，並交換建設經濟之意見。</p>
<h3>黃金非法投機買賣　當局絕對取締　以安定金融抑平物價</h3>
<p>日前本市盛傳黃金自田買賣，價格幷無庸限制，因而引起社會人士之嚴重注意，按過去本市物價之高漲，均受黃金與米糧價格之變化而暴騰，凡百物價俱視黃金米糧漲落爲轉移，其中尤以投機者操縱遭受影響更大。自大東亞戰爭發動後，政府當局為安定金融，抑平物價，對於黃金與米糧非法交易歲加取締，首先取締米糧國積居奇，繼之取締黃金交易市塲，尤於近年來取締黃金暗盤交易，更為嚴厲，木市　務當局曾經數次拘儆黃金暗市非法市儈，消滅黃金暗市集團，金融賴以穩定。今忽謠傳黃金可以自由買賣，價格且無庸限制之說，一般社會人士，頗感疑問，茲經中央社記者向當局探悉，政府富局對於黃金雖未加以統制，但對於黃金作非法買賣，或有投機操縱行爲者，當予以更嚴電之懲處，以維金融而平物價。</p>
<h3>一區外戶口粉　今日起發售</h3>
<p>關於除第一區外其他各區之第卅三期計口麵粉，業經市糧食局配給處全數核定，今日起（廿七日）至下月二日止，普遍發售，規定每人得購取一市斤，售價中儲券十一元正，逾期則該期粉證，一律作廢，不再補售。</p>
<h3>棉布臨時配給各區一律實施</h3>

<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>提高每畝的收穫額</h3>
<p>小倉最高經濟顧問前日答記者問時，關於物價問題，認爲欲解決物價，須有二種施策，一爲增加生產，二爲減縮通貨。因為增加生產是有賴政府與人民共同協力的，所以再就增加生產一點來說一說。</p>
<p>增加生產自以增加食糧等必需品爲第一目標。以此次此界大戰中的歐洲而言，重要食粗的不足，固無日不在逐漸設法補充中，而特別關心者，乃爲提高東南歐洲侮公頃的收穫額，以恢復歐洲的平均生產。據德國方面的計算，如能把東南歐洲每公頃的收穫額提高至現在歐洲的平均額，則可以完成歐洲大陸的食糧自給自足。我們大可以換句話來說，如能把中國東南每畝的收穫額，提高至現在中國的平均額，則可以完成中國的食糧自給自足。</p>
<p>可是，要提高國內各地每畝的　　額，祗有在獲得充份的勞働力，肥料，優良種子，及完備的農耕器械以後始有可能·環顧今日國中的農事，祗怕從今每畝的收穫額，非但難於提高，甚且勢必減低，因爲一部份的勞慟力，已經化為「單帮了，」一部份的米棉種子，已經為豆與爲粟的種子所代替了，一部份的幾耕器械，已經常作廢金屬賣掉，以維生活了。所以，要使食糧自給自足，要提高每畝的收穫額，必須從這些規實問題，着手調整，萬不可以其小而忽之</p>
<h3>伊姆法爾敵軍　已成甕中之鼈　日陸軍報道部發言人談</h3>
<p>日駐華上海陸軍報道部發言人，於昨（二十六）日下午三時，在循例報道常會席上，會見木市中國新聞記者時，發表伊姆法爾大包圍戰之重要性，並痛斥敵方反宜傳之荒謬無稽。</p>
<h3>完成緊密包圍陣錢</h3>
<p>發言人首謂：四月十二日後，日軍之軍事行動，更爲進展，完全集中伊姆法爾及巳列爾兩點，完成緊密之包圍陣綫。敵軍在四面緊逼之重圍中，其實力兩地計有第四軍部下之第十七師，第二十師，第二十三師，及機械化旅團，均巳成爲甕中之鼈，靜待被殲而已。若伊姆法爾陷落後，日軍當可直迫馬尼泊爾，而截斷阿蕯密至孟加拉之鐵道，敵軍現賴此鐵道，援軍深深開來，企圖死守重要據點馬尼泊爾。惟日軍幾路進攻，速率出乎敵軍意料之外。日有力部隊刻已進抵距離馬尼泊爾三十公里之處，使敵軍大為喪胆。</p>
<h3>敵方宣傳絕對無稽</h3>
<p>繼又解釋伊姆法爾尚未陷落之原因，略謂：日軍未攻陷伊姆法爾，爲敵方宜傳之根據，蓋敵方前巳發出悲觀論調，並　楊伊姆法爾及哥希馬日軍之堅强陣勢，及作戰之英勇，最近竟因日軍之禾攻陷伊姆法爾，乃別出心裁，作無聊之宣傳，謂日軍已呈膠着狀態，銳氣已失，於是有一部份人士乃加以推測，以為過去日軍進展神速，此次乃係日軍銳氣喪失，或係英美軍反攻加强所致，本人根據伊姆法爾軍事情報及戰略觀察，痛斥敵方反宜傳之絕對無稍。　一部份人士之推測，純為受敵方反宜傳後之錯誤感覺所致，　伊姆法爾及巴列爾在日軍重重　困中，已可瞭如指掌，惟鑒於過去日軍進展之神速，有時占領一地，難免被敵軍漏網，故此次決加以總殲滅，不留一兵一卒，務使敵軍全軍覆減，故此次愼重嚴密布置包圍陣綫。</p>
<h3>日軍採取新野戰術</h3>
<p>敵軍以機械化旅團為主體，配備相當優秀，日軍乃以步兵爲主體，而以機械化部隊及砲兵部隊為輔助，因此各方觀察伊姆法爾不易佔領，結果日軍却　速佔領其一部份，而又迅速調動大批機械化部隊，現一切軍事配備業已布置就緒，不日當可一舉而攻下伊姆法爾。　日軍以野戰攻取要塞法，在伊地四週展開野戰，布置包圍陣綫，猶如鐵桶般，所謂包國陣綫，乃理想之戰術，即於包圍綫外，敵軍竄出部份又成立新包圍綫，如此敵軍絕無一兵一率漏網，靜待全軍覆減而已。日軍此次忍耐，實爲一勞永逸計，在軍事上政治上具有極大竟義，佔領伊姆法爾可為印度北部吸事吿一階段，確立自由印度政府之基礙，此次日軍進攻伊地，送如漁翁之捕魚，迅速把握時機，議愼撒布漁網，靜以制動，然後不難垂手而得大魚。</p>

<h3>請領轉租執照　辦法應加改善</h3>
<p>— 文景賢</p>
<p>二房東轉租執照，會由第一區公署公吿領取，如逾限四月十五日以後，即須每日罰款一元。鄙人係住居西區，家中均屬婦孺，自身又有職業，因居屋有轉租關係，為遵從當局吿論，不得不請假辦理理此項手績。</p>
<p>當即塡就中請書，帶同春季房捐票向公吿指定之梵皇波路一號（舊極司非而路）西區捐稅處領取轉租執照，每日排隊鵠候者，約有四五百人，但接連數日無故被擯，不許頒照，數難勝計。該處每日請領執照之人如此衆多，而發給執照之數極少，每祇十餘號或二三十號，即宣吿照已發完，停止不給一。迨至十五最後一日，突據管門巡捕聲稱，明日起須要按日繳納罰金一元，此處已不再發，詢問此後應向何處請領，又不理睬。實使人徒耗多日寶貴光陰，終至無所適從。</p>
<p>查　金之意義，乃係處分故意或過失行為，如以人民旣遵守法令，每日前往領照而不得者，反遭處罰，殊非事理之平，亟藥當局對於此種發照手續，重加考慮，另定妥善便利辦法。或訂定限期，一面並將申請書格式以及紙張大小，登報公告，（或飾保甲長查明轉發），由二房東依式　寫，掛號函審給證處，再由給　處按照兩到先後，分別榜示日期，　令二房東前來領照倘，有逾限不來函請者，即照章按日處繳罰款。如此旣可免人民每日跋涉，　費時問之勞，又可社絕辦事人員刁難取巧之弊，　有攸歸，政獲推行。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>眞人似乎不能接受這樣煩擾似的，獨自一個人，佇立在艦尾的甲板上。</p>
<p>又是那天的感慨，浮現出心頭。</p>
<p>（那年那月，武裝起來後，卷土重來，示以限色！）</p>
<p>這或許是所有候補生心裏所懷着的感慨，然而　人的心，雖與此類似，但有所不同。</p>
<p>他在回想，價時美國那稱威武堂堂的紫敵艦隊的情形。他在汽車裏注自凝視那種咨罷　時，有說不出的快活感，就是已方的精神遠勝他一籌。在擁有柔道二段榮譽的眞人看來，對方是有一個很大的「缺陷」。</p>
<p>（旣是這樣，還有什麼可怕的呢？）</p>
<p>他深深地在心窩裏記住這一點。然而並未對任何人請過。其實也不是向他人謂的事。</p>
<p>現在他在　翠色的海面上，暗　地在心板上，重演那天的印像　腦海是冰般的淸冷透明，而心頭烈火部熊罷　燃燒。</p>
<p>突然在他的眼前，波浪中，又出現了隱隱約約的黑影。又是鯊魚在游着。兩丈上下的大魚，左石　着銀色的肚皮，而猛烈地飛游着。眞人用眼睛數着鯊魚的數目，有的似乎不呌數一樣，潛入水底，然而是：九條的鯊魚羣。他似乎忘掉了一切，而只注視着鯊魚羣。於是他的身軀，徐徐地被拖人水底。周圍變成翡翠色的世界。看見了靑白色的海底細砂。他變成了鯊魚。鯊魚排列着隊伍，悄悄地，無聲地，向眞珠　的方面前進———</p>
<p>忽然一注意，他的身軀還是在甲板上。幻景消逝後的海面，只是漂浮着無邊無邊的航跡波紋。不知道什麼時候，本艦業已開始移動了。</p>
<h3>劉葵中書畫展覧會</h3>
<p>— 吾翁</p>
<p>今春的上海國畫界，特別多的便是花卉畫的展覽了。汪亞塵的「金魚」展過了之後，便有白龍山人王一事公子季眉的盡展，也是以花卉盡取勝。二十五日起，又有劉葵中的展覧會在中國畫苑舉行了。</p>
<p>國畫家往往是個書法家，那是因為國畫上的用筆骨法，都須出諸盡法的訓練。所以，善書者必能書，成了一條公理。劉先生是一個花卉畫家，同時是一個書法家，其成因當然也不能與上述有所例外。不信，看他今番的作品，不是醫畫雙絕嗎？</p>
<p>劉先生從鐘鼎篆　研慕之後，獲得了用筆的基礎，更進而至於漢魏碑碣的臨寫。而得到勁健的氣勢。於是運用於畫面上者，自然是疏落挺拔，蒼老古樸的綫條所組成的那種寫意的風格了。</p>
<p>地的花卉，不以織細工整妍秀穠麗來取勝，雖然與他的醫法相關，但他的個性的特異，一種北國人的豪爽的氣質，決不能與江南人的柔和的秉賦相提並論的，這可以見之於他的書法，更可以證之於他的盡。</p>
<p>從這樣的觀點出發，劉先生在國畫創作的進程上，不傾向於院體工筆的一流，而沉浸於靑藤白陽以至於李復堂汪巢林諸家的作風的領域之中，那就不是偶然的事了。這些明淸諸大家的作風是從中國文人畫中發腿出來的，也正是中國花卉畫的神髓。</p>
<p>此次展覽之中，像「月季」「天竹」「機　」等幾幅，不但瀟洒脫俗，縱橫豪放，且於筆墨章法一道，別開蹊徑，　罷古人獷　怪誕之風，臻於活靜淡泊，沉雄瑰麗之境，若說是劉先生的一此風格的創造，也不以為過。</p>

<h3>學生家長應否繳納　「解剖學敎室費」</h3>
<p>東南醫學院，近為「復興解剖學教室」，向侮一學生家長微收費用一千元，並須在十天內繳付，否則不准參加考試。查事變以還，學校設備毀廢，因陋就簡，於教育效率，自有影響，更以解剖為醫科之主要課程，集資重建教室，以利學子實騐，原為未可厚非之事。但當茲物價騰貴，生活維艱之際，家長負担子弟入校求學，本非易事，對比額外費用，除極少數富有之家長外，殊有不勝負擔之苦。况「復與解剖學教室」，原為學校自身問題，學生家長，亦無負擔該費之養務，即使校方近於經濟，不得已而商諸學生家長，亦應派員加以解釋，隨家長之能力與星期而加捐助，然亦不能指定金額，限期繳送。故希望該校當局，　念家長困難，另　善策，則學生幸甚，家長幸甚。（家長吳光新謹啓）。</p>

<h3>Displaced Persons Resettlement</h3>
<p>As we stroll through the streets, we often see fellow citizens with gaunt faces and emaciated figures trailing behind us, begging for alms. Upon observing their ages, many are in their prime. At the train and bus stations, there are even more idlers and vagrants, with thieving eyes, engaging in cunning schemes of extortion. Recently, those caught and arrested for robbery under the cover of darkness are mostly strong, prime-aged individuals. Upon careful consideration, it seems unlikely that these people willingly degenerate or commit crimes. A significant portion of them are driven to desperate measures due to the pressures of life, making it a primary cause. If we think from this perspective, then eliminating the causes that drive people to desperate measures requires fundamental research and implementation.</p>
<p>In criminology, poverty is analyzed as one of the causes of crime. If we want to prevent the increase in crime, it is crucial to alleviate poverty. Therefore, "poverty" is the cause of crime for some criminals in Shanghai. Thus, alleviating poverty is not only a charitable endeavor of benevolence but also a proactive measure to prevent crime.</p>
<p>Let us assume that there are three types of people in Shanghai as mentioned above, whom we shall tentatively call displaced persons, who should be rescued. The first type is the gaunt-faced beggars. The second type is the idle thieves. The third type is the violent thugs who commit robberies at night. The latter two types often evolve from the former two. Therefore, by thoroughly rescuing the first two types of people, the latter type will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>So, who should bear the responsibility for this rescue? Of course, the government should take the lead, and society should fulfill its duty to assist. We believe that the rescue method should not be passive sheltering but actively enabling them to produce and support themselves. Sheltering requires enormous expenses, and if it is disbanded due to insufficient funding, it will not be thorough. Only by carefully planning simple and easy-to-implement production methods, forcibly ordering them to engage in productive work, and applying strict management can we achieve lasting results. On the one hand, the displaced persons can become self-reliant, and on the other hand, the appearance of Shanghai can be improved, criminal cases can be reduced, and social tranquility can be ensured, which is a great gain.</p>
<p>Here, we suggest adopting the "displaced persons resettlement" method. The so-called "resettlement" here does not require large-scale economic investment, and the resettlement area is not a remote border region. We advocate opening up all the wasteland in the suburbs of Shanghai as resettlement areas for displaced persons, forcibly concentrating all beggars in Shanghai, except for the old, weak, and young. All idlers without legitimate occupations from docks, bus stations, and other places should also be forcibly concentrated, transported away from Shanghai, and settled in one or several locations, where they will receive short-term agricultural skills training and be assigned to farming. If there is not enough wasteland, they can help nearby farmers with their farming or work as long-term laborers.</p>
<p>We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Welfare will take charge of this matter, investigate the wasteland in the suburbs, and properly plan the implementation methods. The Citizens Welfare Association will assist from the sidelines, and the police will be responsible for the forced relocation. Through division of labor and cooperation, success can be achieved.</p>
<p>Increasing production is already a universally accepted slogan. Utilizing wasteland to increase agricultural production and food supply is naturally a crucial measure. Ensuring public security and reforming Shanghai are the goals set by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, relocating displaced persons can reduce criminal cases in society and ensure a certain level of public security, which is a multi-beneficial measure. We hope that prompt action will be taken.</p>
<h3>### North-South Exchange Restrictions to be Completely Lifted Next Month Realizing Free Flow of Funds in All Regions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Due to various reasons, exchange between the North and South has not been smooth in the past, and restrictions have been quite strict, which has had a great impact on the people's economy, financial regulation, and exchange of goods. The financial authorities of the National Government, aware of this, have been striving to improve the situation. Since April 1st of last year, when the Allied nations, in order to assist us in completing the unification of the currency system, resolutely stopped issuing new military scrip on their own, the authorities first determined the ratio between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes, stipulating a ratio of 100 Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 United Reserve Bank Notes. By December 1st of last year, the Central Reserve Bank Notes were further expanded for circulation to the Huaihai region, and used concurrently with the United Reserve Bank Notes. From April 10th to April 30th of this year, it was further stipulated that the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes in the Huaihai region would be fully exchanged within a limited time. In addition, the regulations for people carrying paper money between the North and South were revised, and the original quota was appropriately increased. In order to crack down on the black market prices of the United Reserve Bank Notes in Central China (especially Shanghai) and to stabilize the entire financial system, 17 banks were designated in Shanghai to handle the exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes. All of these measures are major steps taken by the authorities to regulate North-South finance. Since their implementation, they have greatly benefited the National Government's overall financial regulation and the exchange of goods between the North and South. Now, in order to implement the established policies and promote smoother progress, the authorities have decided to completely lift the exchange restrictions between the North and South from May 1st, and free exchange will be allowed without restrictions in the future. This measure has far-reaching significance in various aspects, whether it is the government's financial policies, the people's economic activities, or the exchange of goods between the North and South. Therefore, the news has been widely spread, and the people of the North and South have placed deeper and more enthusiastic trust in the government, which will greatly contribute to the completion of the National Government's wartime economic system and the fulfillment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is firmly believed that the implementation of this measure will achieve the following great results, which can be predicted.   The exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes will definitely become smoother in the future, which has great significance for the credit and circulation range of the Central Reserve Bank Notes.   The people's economy in the North and South will also become more active in the future due to the lifting of exchange restrictions, which has a profound impact on the future of the entire national economic construction.   The National Government's financial regulation policies will have another expansion, reaping groundbreaking results, and completing its predetermined goals.   The exchange of goods between the North and South will also become smoother as a result, which has a more profound significance under the National Government's major premise of suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Embassy and Finance Minister Zhou Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement on the 26th regarding the exchange rate in the North China region, insisting on the ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan: The National Government has always insisted on the policy of 100 Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 United Reserve Bank Notes for exchange in the North China region. This time, the abolition of general exchange restrictions to North China and the implementation of free and unrestricted exchange from May 1st will also be adopted in North China to ensure smooth exchange of normal funds between the two regions. In the past, the Japanese government has insisted on the established policy of the current exchange rate between various Chinese currencies such as Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes and the Japanese yen, and has implemented various measures to strongly support China's currency policy. The National Government's measure this time is to adapt to the Japanese government's policy, so that the economy of the two regions of China, North and South, will become closer. It is very gratifying that it will contribute to China's economic construction and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Statement by the Finance Minister: The Central Reserve Bank Notes and the China United Reserve Bank Notes have long been the only currencies in the peaceful areas of the North and South, and have been deeply trusted by the people. They are particularly convenient for the circulation of goods and financial regulation. Recently, since the currency system in Huaihai Province has been repeatedly adjusted by the government and continued to be strongly promoted, all exchange transactions between the North and South have gradually become smoother. The government still insists on the exchange rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the China United Reserve Bank Notes, so that it remains stable at all times. As for the general exchange situation, in view of the actual situation, the exchange limit between the North and South was previously raised to 5,000 yuan to meet the needs. Now, for the convenience of all the people, the previous exchange limit will be abolished from May 1st, and the ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes will not be changed in any way, and will still be maintained. Hereafter, normal transactions on exchange will be free, and speculative capital movements will still be strictly cracked down on as in the past. It is firmly believed that the exchange of goods and the regulation of funds between the North and South will definitely become smoother in the future. Their economic relationship will also become closer as a result. I hope that everyone will understand this and assist us in achieving success. If anyone engages in speculative transactions and violates the law, the government will never be lenient, and I hope you will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>### Mr. Kureta Appointed as Advisor to the Law and Regulation Compilation Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - In order to ensure the smooth operation of judicial power after the abolition of extraterritoriality in the future, the Ministry of Judicial Administration organized the Law and Regulation Compilation Committee last winter to study and improve China's judicial system, and planned to hire famous jurists from allied countries as advisors to the Law and Regulation Compilation Committee. After careful consideration, Mr. Kureta, a judge of the Japanese Supreme Court and a legal scholar, was hired as an advisor to the committee. Mr. Kureta arrived in Nanjing a few days ago to take office and set up an office at No. 3 Xikang Road to start work.</p>
<h3>### North China Newspapers Merged and Renamed North China New Daily</h3>
<p>Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the current situation, the North China News Association has decided to merge the newspapers in the Beijing and Tianjin areas, and will establish the North China New Daily on May 1st to publish the North China New Daily. At the same time, the Xinmin Daily, Shibao, and Minzhong Daily currently in Beijing, and the Yongbao and Tianjin Daily in Tianjin, will all be discontinued. The newly established North China New Daily will set up a head office in Beiping and a branch office in Tianjin, and publish newspapers with the same name in both places.</p>
<h3>### Excellent Results of Exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes in Huai Province</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to unify the currency system in Huaihai Province, the Ministry of Finance specifically started using the Central Reserve Bank Notes in the province from December 1st of last year. Since its implementation, it has had a great effect on stabilizing finance and balancing commodity prices. Therefore, it was implemented to fully exchange with the United Reserve Bank Notes at a ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. In order to supervise and understand the situation of the full exchange, the Ministry of Finance previously sent Mr. Hu Yanxi, a specialist from the ministry, to the province for inspection. The official has now submitted the inspection results to the ministry. It is reported that the Huai Province Finance Department, the Central Reserve Bank branch, and the assistance of various relevant agencies in the exchange work are extremely smooth, so the results are very good.</p>

<h3>### Japanese Speaker Matsudaira and Others Host Philippine Delegation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Parliament heard the news that Philippine Special Envoy Aquino, who recently visited Japan to return the visit, was appointed as Speaker of the Philippine National Assembly. To celebrate Aquino and establish friendship between the two countries, Japanese Speaker of the House of Peers Matsudaira and Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada specially hosted the ambassador and his delegation at the parliament building this afternoon.

<h3>### Two Japanese Hospital Ships Illegally Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The number of incidents in which the United States illegally bombed Japanese hospital ships in the past is countless. On January 26th and March 14th of this year, the Japanese hospital ships Yoshino Maru were again illegally bombed by American planes in the southern sea. The Japanese government has now ordered Suma, the minister to Spain, to request the Spanish government to lodge a serious protest with the United States. According to reports, both hospital ships were clearly marked with the Red Cross when they were subjected to low-altitude bombing. As a result, one crew member of the Yoshino Maru was injured, and the Nemuro Maru was severely damaged.</p>

<h3>### Japanese Yasukuni Shrine Holds Fifth Extraordinary Grand Festival His Majesty the Emperor Personally Visits to Worship the Spirits of the War Dead</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The fifth extraordinary grand festival of the Japanese Yasukuni Shrine was held on the 24th with solemnity under the devout worship of Japanese officials and people. Everyone knows that the Yasukuni Shrine is a shrine dedicated to the spirits of the soldiers who have devoted their lives to the country throughout the ages and has a long history. Therefore, the architecture of the shrine is very magnificent, and the trees in the shrine reach the sky, forming a natural solemnity. At the same time, it is also the center of worship for the Japanese people. Today, as the war enters a severe stage, the Yasukuni Shrine is even more worshiped. The spirits of the war dead worshiped in this extraordinary grand festival are the brave Japanese soldiers who gloriously died in the period from the Manchurian Incident to March 21, Showa 17 after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In order to comfort the careers of the heroic soldiers in heaven and to pay deep respect to the families of the warriors, this grand festival is even more grand and solemn. From a few days ago, the families of the warriors from all over the country gathered in Tokyo to express their condolences and gratitude to their sons, fathers, and husbands. At the same time, they also received great respect and gratitude from the general public. Slogans such as "Be grateful to the spirits of the war dead, be respectful to the families" were posted everywhere on the streets and alleys. And the slogans have been fully expressed in fact. The 25th was the second day of the grand festival. Early in the morning, the sky was covered with a layer of dark spirits, and it was raining continuously, as if the gods also expressed their deep condolences to these spirits of the war dead. At 1:15 PM, His Majesty the Emperor, accompanied by civil and military officials, visited the Yasukuni Shrine. More than 50,000 family members were lined up on both sides of the road leading to the shrine to welcome His Majesty the Emperor and pay their respects to His Majesty. They all felt the honor of the emperor. In the sound of the naval spirit music, His Majesty the Emperor, under the welcoming of the ministers and the guidance of the chairman of the grand festival committee, Zewamoto, visited the wooden ship and paid homage to the spirits of the war dead. At that time, Japanese officials and civilians also paid remote homage to the heroic spirits of the Yasukuni Shrine in their respective locations, expressing their heartfelt gratitude. After His Majesty the Emperor returned to the Imperial Palace, the general public flocked to the shrine to worship. Although it was still raining constantly, their gratitude made them unable to care about all this, so the road leading to the shrine was impenetrable. They walked to the shrine one by one and bowed deeply. The families were also worshiping piously in teams. The four sides of the shrine were piled with tributes from various officials and organizations. On both sides of the approach, there were tall murals about the Greater East Asia War and modern Japanese weapons on display, fully showing the power of the Japanese army. The cherry blossoms in Yasukuni were in full bloom. The fragments of flowers, falling on the ground and on people's faces, also seemed to be sadly falling because of the death of the heroic soldiers. In short, the Yasukuni Shrine was shrouded in a solemn atmosphere, but people suppressed the grief in their hearts and decided to continue the legacy of the martyrs and bravely move towards the path of victory.</p>
<h3>### Rommel Inspects Western Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - In view of the growing momentum of the anti-Axis forces attempting to land in Western Europe, the German army is strengthening its defenses along the European coast in preparation for any eventuality. It is learned that Field Marshal Rommel, the commander-in-chief of the German army in Europe, recently inspected the defenses along the coast of Western Europe.

<h3>British Troops in Imphal Region Trapped and Isolated Japanese Aircraft Formations Bombard Enemy Artillery Positions</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's British Fourth Corps has been trapped and isolated in the Imphal Basin, and now can only rely on aerial resupply to continue its desperate resistance. The Barel, Nungshigum, and Seibom areas, which the enemy army relied on, have already been under direct attack by the Japanese army, so the troubles of the enemy's Fourth Corps are increasing day by day. Mountbatten, the supreme commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, who recently went to Ceylon, is actively using air force units to try to rescue the two isolated armies of the Fourth Corps and the airborne troops, but because the rainy season is approaching, aerial resupply has become increasingly difficult. Therefore, the ground troops of the enemy army have a strong feeling that they are eagerly waiting for the air force to rescue them. Also, the enemy's air force is already feeling the danger of the Japanese-Indian Allied forces entering the forward base in eastern India, and has now moved the air force combat headquarters to Calcutta. At the same time, it is gathering military supplies and the remnants of the Seventh Division, which was defeated in the Muxi battle, to rescue the isolated army trapped in Imphal. Also, on the 21st, a group of enemy Douglas transport planes flying over a certain area numbered 51 heading east and 15 heading west. It seems that all of those heading west were transporting the wounded. In short, the Imphal Basin is now in a chaotic state on the eve of a major battle.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - On the 24th evening, two squadrons of Japanese army fighter-bombers attacked enemy artillery positions near Imphal, causing a large fire in enemy military facilities. On the way back, they encountered enemy planes and shot down one P40 fighter and one large transport plane, Douglas B-c-B. The Japanese air force safely returned.</p>
<h3>### Muslims Rise Up to Fight for Independence and Freedom The Very Reverend Archbishop Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Ibrahim, the head of the Muslim community in Japan, issued a statement saying: The Very Reverend Archbishop of Jerusalem, Feyseni, called on Muslims all over the world to rise up and cooperate with the Japanese and Indian armies to suppress the violent British and Americans. Now all the Muslims in East Asia have risen up to respond to this move, which is very noteworthy. The Very Reverend Ibrahim has long been saddened and angered by the British and American aggression in West Asia. He believes that if there is no Japan in Asia, there will be no recovery. Therefore, he devoted his life's energy to the cause of the revival of Asia. Now the Indian independence movement has a strong military organization. The Asian Muslim ethnic groups of India are now united and moving towards the heavenly path of liberation. Today's opportunity for liberation is truly cherished by all Muslims, because the Axis powers' declaration of war on the aggressors Britain and the United States is the same as the religious duty of Muslims. When we Muslims participate in the war of the Axis powers, the peace and freedom of all Muslims can be fully obtained. All Muslim compatriots in East Asia, namely Malaysia, Java, and Sumatra, have expelled the British and American forces in this Greater East Asia War and restored their hope and freedom. Muslim friends in India, please respond to the Japanese and Indian armies and fight for freedom and peace immediately. Muslim friends in West Asia, the military pressure of the Axis powers has made the British and Americans extremely embarrassed. In their panic, they entrusted the holy land of Palestine to the Jews. This holy land will be bought and sold by the poisonous fangs of capitalism. Their immorality and their internal contradictions are the terminal symptoms of their imperialism and have been fully exposed. Muslims resolutely resist their oppression of religion and deprivation of freedom. Now, when the 120 million liberated Muslims in East Asia and the 80 million liberated Muslims in India cooperate with the 100 million friends in West Asia, the liberation of the Muslim ethnic groups will be realized quickly. I am extremely happy to see the realization of the liberation of Muslims at the age of 95.</p>

<h3>Anti-Axis Indiscriminate Bombing: Hundreds of Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over German and Romanian Cities</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that according to an official German announcement, American aircraft attacked various locations in Romania yesterday, particularly focusing on Bucharest, the Romanian capital. German and Romanian air defense forces shot down a total of 25 enemy aircraft. During attacks on Munich, Friedrichshafen, and other places, a total of 97 American aircraft were shot down. Last night, British aircraft, after violating Swiss neutrality, flew to Munich and carried out terrorist air raids. Karlsruhe and Erfurt were also specific targets of the British aircraft. German anti-aircraft guns, under extremely unfavorable air defense conditions, shot down 45 British aircraft.</p>
<h3>Munich: Ancient Buildings Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Munich, British bomber squadrons launched a large-scale attack on Munich on the evening of the 24th, indiscriminately bombing residential areas and cultural centers, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. Ancient buildings of world renown, such as the Munich Library, the Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Concert Hall, were all reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Exert Economic Pressure on Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - A Huitong News Agency report states: Rumors have been circulating that the British and American governments have demanded that Portugal cease trade with Germany. Official statements have not been issued, leaving the public without information. Recently, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar has held multiple talks with British Ambassador to Portugal, Campbell, and Minister of Commerce, Duke. The Portuguese people are well aware that their country relies on Britain and the United States for a large supply of grains, coal, and other fuels. If these important imports are interrupted, Portugal will face extreme hardship.</p>
<h3>Fighting Resumes at the Nettuno Bridgehead</h3>

American forces, with the strength of a squadron and under the cover of tanks, have launched repeated attacks near the Carano Cemetery. Fierce fighting ensued, and the former German front lines remain in German hands.</p>
<h3>German Observations on Opening a Second Front: Frequent Military Movements Indicate Inevitable Implementation Sooner or Later</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the issue of a second front has been the subject of much debate, leading to increased tension in Europe. As for whether a second front will be realized, in our judgment, the anti-Axis powers, in order to ensure the continued success of the Soviet Union, must not avoid any sacrifices in creating a second front. Recently, anti-Axis troop and warship movements to and from Britain have become increasingly frequent. A large number of transport ships have concentrated in southern England, and landing craft from the Mediterranean have successively sailed to Britain. American commanders stationed in Italy with landing operation experience have also traveled to Britain one after another. Furthermore, the United States is transporting large numbers of troops and supplies to Britain daily. All of this is in preparation for a landing. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' second front will definitely be realized, and it is not the same as the false propaganda of a year ago. However, it is necessary to study when, how, and where the anti-Axis forces will land.</p>
<p>Possible Landing Locations</p>
<p>Include the Brittany Peninsula, the French coast, and the southern coast of the Mediterranean. The purpose of landing operations in these locations is to disperse and contain German forces. The true attack on the continent must select a location closest to British territory, and therefore must utilize the Strait of Dover. This is all based on military knowledge and deduction.</p>
<p>Another possible landing location is southern Norway or countries like Denmark and Sweden. After landing here, an air force base could be established and a direct assault launched from northeast Germany into the heart of Germany. From a military perspective, the anti-Axis forces are quite likely to adopt this approach, which has political implications for attacking Central Europe. On the one hand, it can avoid the Atlantic coast and attack Germany from the rear, while also reducing the sacrifice of soldiers and utilizing material advantages. If this tactic is adopted, the anti-Axis forces will likely first force Sweden to join the war. As for the</p>
<p>Tactical Methods</p>
<p>The tactics used in the Pacific will also be adopted, initially with large-scale air force bombing to destroy German air force and coastal defenses, completely seizing control of the seas and skies over Western Europe. Then, landing craft will be launched in a coordinated effort, landing several divisions of troops simultaneously, along with large-scale parachute drops to secure landing points. After that, the large numbers of anti-Axis troops waiting in Britain will be directly landed, continuing to expand the landing points and developing a frontal combat situation. However, German coastal defenses have been built up dramatically over the past year. According to British air force reconnaissance, the coastline is equipped with as many as 50,000 anti-aircraft guns, making air force activity quite difficult. Moreover, all key positions are fully prepared and can continue to fight for several months without relying on external supplies. Therefore, based on common sense, seizing German coastal strongholds is practically impossible. Furthermore, a report from the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee stated that the initial month of a landing operation would require the sacrifice of 75,000 lives, a truly frightening figure. From this perspective, the anti-Axis forces' attempt to land on the northern coast of France will not succeed without substantial military preparations.</p>
<p>Speculation on the Timing</p>
<p>Regarding the timing of the landing operation, anti-Axis propaganda claims that it will begin soon, while the German side states that German forces are fully prepared for a landing at any time and in any place. However, Spanish newspapers and Lisbon telegrams both state that the time for a landing operation has not yet arrived and may be delayed until this autumn. The reason given is that German forces still have more troops than expected, and the anti-Axis preparations are also incomplete. The anti-Axis forces must first gain air supremacy over Germany before landing. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the anti-Axis forces focused on bombing German airfields. However, US Secretary of War Stimson recently admitted that the German air force has regained its strength. Of course, the damage suffered by the German aircraft industry is also considerable, but since last year, a decision was made to build many fire-resistant factories in various locations, and its production plan is gradually on track, with the production rate increasing more than a year ago. From another perspective, the anti-Axis landing force consists of approximately 15 to 30 divisions, which is not a small number, but the transportation of one division requires 300,000 tons of ships. This is a major problem in difficult transportation areas such as southern Italy. Therefore, although the anti-Axis forces are concentrating their efforts to prepare for a landing operation, ships are a significant issue.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Fundamental vs. Stopgap Solutions to the Food Problem</h3>
<p>— Yu Nong</p>
<p>The people are the foundation of the nation, and food is the most important thing for the people. People's food is related to safety and security. At this critical moment of the Great East Asia War, the supply of the front lines and the stability of the rear depend entirely on sufficient food reserves. Otherwise, stability cannot be guaranteed. The population of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is approximately 110 million. Farmers account for about 80% of the population, while merchants, artisans, and other professionals account for about 20%. Judging by the peacetime rice production of these three provinces, it was already insufficient. Since the East Asian Incident, transportation has been obstructed, and governance has been inconsistent, leading to a gradual decrease in production and an increasingly unsustainable supply. In Zhejiang Province, eastern Zhejiang is known for its rice production and must rely on supplies from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Southeast Asia. Currently, transportation to Southeast Asia, Hunan, and Jiangxi is blocked, and supplies cannot be obtained. Although eastern Zhejiang has a large rice production, there is currently no way to purchase it. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are not entirely rice-producing areas (60% produce coarse grains, and 40% produce rice). While the 88 million farmers can cultivate and feed themselves, the 22 million merchants, artisans, and other professionals must rely on the farmers' supplies. The shortfall is self-evident. If we assume that each person consumes an average of seven *he* of rice per day, the monthly rice requirement is 2.1 *dou*. For 22 million people, the monthly requirement is approximately 4.62 million *shi*, and the annual requirement is approximately 55.44 million *shi* (each *shi* is approximately 160 *jin*, and 10 *shi* is one ton, totaling 5.544 million tons). Adding the supplies for Allied forces, which require approximately 300,000 tons per year, the total annual requirement is 5.84 million tons. However, a survey of the rice production in various areas of the three provinces under the government's control estimates that the annual production is approximately 7 million tons. After deducting the 5.6 million tons of rice consumed by farmers and the supplies for Allied forces, there is only 1.1 million tons remaining. The gap is still 4.74 million tons. If a solution is not found quickly, the coming disaster will be unpredictable. In my opinion, the solution must address both the root cause and the symptoms to ensure a sufficient supply. I humbly offer my suggestions, hoping they will be adopted.</p>
<p>(A) Addressing the Root Cause</p>
<p>Abolish various rice purchasing agencies. Since the implementation of food control, there have been numerous purchasing agencies with overlapping responsibilities, leading to inevitable exploitation and rampant corruption. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture is facing a crisis, and the military and civilians are complaining. It would be better to abolish all of them and allow the government and the people to cooperate directly in free purchasing. The provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui should be responsible for directing the county governments and local chambers of commerce and *baojia* to cooperate in setting prices and purchasing rice. The government can reduce significant administrative expenses, and farmers can reduce the suffering of multiple layers of oppression. It is expected that purchasing will be more convenient than through control agencies.</p>
<p>Encourage farmers to increase production. In recent years, there have been bandits everywhere, and farmers cannot live and work in peace. The heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes and levies is unbearable. Each year's harvest is not enough to feed themselves, and after the new grain is harvested, the government's low purchase price cannot cover the cost, leading to unforeseen losses. As a result, farmers are abandoning cultivation or even switching to other crops. If they are not quickly encouraged to cultivate, an artificial famine will soon occur. The method of encouragement should be to quickly provide low-interest agricultural loans, lending capital before planting to support production, or allowing farmers to freely sell to chambers of commerce after the new grain is harvested to obtain cash for turnover. If farmers are willing to pre-sell, they should be allowed to contract with the chamber of commerce at any time, allowing farmers' freedom without any coercion. However, the loaned funds must be secured by grain, and the specific measures will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Exempt agricultural fertilizer from taxes. Farmers rely on fertilizer for cultivation. In recent years, fertilizer prices have soared, and transportation is difficult, with overlapping taxes, leading to high costs. Poor farmers cannot afford to buy it, resulting in reduced production. If the government can issue a clear decree to allow the unimpeded transportation of agricultural fertilizer and exempt it from all exorbitant taxes, it will expand the source of fertilizer, which is also a way to subsidize farmers' cultivation and promote production.</p>
<p>Increase the price of rice in producing areas purchased by the government. The German agricultural policy is very thorough in protecting farmers' production. For example, if imported food costs 8 *jiao* per *jin*, the government intentionally raises the price by 3 *jiao* when purchasing domestically produced grain, purchasing it at 1.1 *yuan* per *jin*. With this guarantee, farmers are happy to cultivate, so agricultural production increases daily, and people's livelihoods improve daily. During this war, the country will not lack food because of this. During this war, if we imitate this practice, raising the price of rice in the producing areas and setting a purchase standard to notify farmers in various places, I know they will be eager to transport it.</p>
<p>The above points are the outline of addressing the root cause. However, it must be remembered that during the critical period of the decisive battle, the supply of military food and the needs of the people are both urgent and cannot be delayed. At this time of the year when the old harvest is depleted and the new harvest is not yet in, the rice price cannot be controlled, and the amount of grain currently stored in various places is unknown, making it difficult to allocate and plan. As a stopgap measure for immediate relief, I will list a few points for discussion.</p>
<p>Abolish checkpoints and allow free transportation. The price of rice in Shanghai is more than double the price of rice in the interior. For example, the selling price in rice-producing areas is 2,000 yuan, while in Shanghai it is 4,000 to 4,500 yuan, a significant difference. The reason for this is that there are too many checkpoints along the way, causing difficulties and exploitation, resulting in higher costs. Adding transportation costs and rice merchants' commissions, it is impossible to make up for the losses without increasing the rice price. If the government can resolutely abolish various checkpoints, explicitly prohibit extortion and delays, designate areas, and allow rice merchants to freely transport rice, the rice price will immediately decrease, and the rice shortage in Shanghai will not be as severe as expected.</p>
<p>Provide sufficient food rations to eliminate the black market. If the source of rice is sufficient, the people's panic will be eliminated, and those who hoard grain will naturally decrease because there is no profit to be made. The rationing system is a good method, but insufficient rations can indirectly promote the proliferation of the black market. Judging by the current amount of rations per person, it is not enough for ten days of sustenance. The people are forced to buy rice on the black market, and because there are many buyers, the price gradually increases, causing the people even greater suffering. The remedy is to appropriately increase the amount of rations, providing at least two *dou* per person per month. With sufficient rations, the people no longer need to rely on the black market, and the black market will be eliminated without being suppressed.</p>
<p>Increase the price of rice to absorb farmers' rice. In Shanghai, the normal daily sales of rice are approximately 10,000 *shi*, with a monthly requirement of 300,000 *shi*, including the rice transported to other ports by ships and passengers. Although the population has increased sharply, the amount of rice transported by ships and passengers has decreased compared to the past. This decrease cannot offset the household consumption. The total is still no more than 300,000 *shi*, which is 30,000 tons per month, with each *shi* weighing 10 tons. The total annual requirement is 360,000 tons. In order to alleviate the panic over food in Shanghai, the remaining 1.1 million tons of rice in the producing areas should be quickly transported to Shanghai by increasing the price. All the abuses of checkpoints, extortion, and delays should be eliminated. After transportation, the rice price will not be too expensive. If the amount of absorbed rice is insufficient, it can be supplemented with mixed grains to meet the daily requirement of seven *he* per person. With sufficient daily food, the people naturally do not need to rely on the black market, and the rice price will tend towards equilibrium. Since the three provinces produce 7 million tons of rice, and farmers themselves consume 5.6 million tons, if farmers are willing to sell at a good price, they can voluntarily mix grains in their own diet and sell their own rice. Through this transfer, the Shanghai rice shortage can be easily alleviated. This is the best policy.</p>
<p>In short, the government's purchase of rice, regardless of the time, must listen to the people's opinions and cooperate with the people. In this time of war, it is especially necessary to make the people thoroughly understand the government's national policy, wholeheartedly share weal and woe with the government, and cut through difficulties together. Then, the problems will be easily solved. Last year, when the new grain was harvested, the official price was limited to 280 yuan per *shi*, while the selling price in Shanghai was as high as 800 yuan per *shi*. Purchasing officials acted vigorously, forcibly purchasing rice. Farmers wept silently, unable to complain, while corrupt officials took the opportunity to seek profit and enrich themselves. Farmers suffered from this pain, and the cost of fertilizer was too high. The fruits of a year of hard work were not even enough to cover the cost, and there were also the disturbances of exorbitant taxes and levies. Those who abandoned their fields were everywhere. In this situation, the military and civilian food shortage is unimaginable. I still remember that after the Russian Revolution, the government's purchase of food was limited to a low price, and farmers fled in droves. Most of the land was uncultivated. Although the government had harsh laws and strict punishments, it could not force the farmers to resume cultivation, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. This is the reaction of not being able to cooperate with the people. The people's resentment is why they do not want to be subjects. Forcible purchasing at a limited price failed in Russia. It should not be repeated. Therefore, in my opinion, we should imitate the German method of protecting farmers, encouraging production to strengthen the decisive battle in East Asia. On the one hand, the government and the people should seek sincere cooperation without any estrangement. Take advantage of the time before planting to inform the farmers about the government's policies and encourage them to cultivate with peace of mind. On the other hand, promulgate measures to encourage them and eliminate the checkpoints that cause extortion and delays. Then, the current difficulties can be alleviated somewhat, and future production can also be effectively increased. This is a policy that addresses both the root cause and the symptoms.</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen Fetes Japanese Minister Usami: Also Delivers Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>Japanese Minister Usami arrived in Shanghai to take up his new post. To express their welcome, the municipal government hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM yesterday (25th). From the embassy, there were Minister Usami, Counselor Okazaki, Consul General Yano, Secretary Okumura, Consul Nakagawa, Secretary Hanakada, and Secretary Nakada. From the municipal government, there were Mayor Chen, the Secretary General, Advisor Funatsu, and various bureau chiefs, counselors, and secretaries, totaling more than 30 people. During the banquet, Mayor Chen delivered a speech, saying that Minister Usami has been in China for many years and has long been a friend of China. This appointment will certainly see the implementation of new policies more actively. Since the recovery of the concessions by this city, various measures have been actively implemented with the support of the Japanese Embassy. Economic problems are particularly heavy and require increased efforts from both sides. He knows that the Minister is very concerned about this and hopes for constant guidance. Minister Usami replied that arriving in Shanghai feels like returning home, with a sense of closeness. When the Shanghai concessions were returned, he was in Tokyo and expressed his feelings by telegram, saying that China would certainly develop strongly after recovering the concessions. He is now impressed by the good results of the municipal government in all aspects. At this important time, the Sino-Japanese allies must strengthen cooperation to overcome difficulties in order to achieve common goals. He is determined to work together with everyone and asks for more assistance. After the speeches, the guests raised their glasses to wish each other health and happiness, and the party ended in joy.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Orders Submission of Details from All Factories</h3>
<p>In order to encourage increased production and find ways to alleviate the difficulties of various factories in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has ordered all sub-associations to quickly submit detailed information on the factories in order to seek comprehensive solutions. The original order is as follows: "Economic measures during wartime should prioritize increased production. Recently, due to restrictions on electricity, shortages of coal, or difficulties in obtaining raw materials, various factories have been hindered in their work and production has been reduced, which is extremely detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood and has a huge impact. In order to understand the actual situation of various factories, this bureau hereby orders the association to instruct its members to report the detailed situation of each factory in a list, so as to make comprehensive plans and find ways to alleviate the difficulties. The association is also ordered to compile and report to the bureau within a time limit, without delay." It has been learned that the bureau has ordered the following associations to comply, including coal briquette industry, alcohol industry, rubber industry, blacksmithing industry, woolen textile industry, leather manufacturing industry, silverware industry, tin printing and can manufacturing industry, paint manufacturing industry, bicycle manufacturing industry, papermaking industry, cotton textile industry, electrical appliance industry, tobacco factory industry, machinery industry, cloth factory industry, chemical industry, enamel industry, hardware industry, electric welding industry, match industry, silk weaving industry, casting industry, glass industry, silk factory industry, soap and candle industry, vacuum bottle industry, refrigeration industry, ice industry, electroplating industry, and match raw material industry. As this matter concerns the vital interests of all industries in the city, the associations are ordered to submit the information quickly.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Orders Dance Schools to Close</h3>
<p>Dance schools are rampant in this city, harboring filth and causing great harm. At this time when we are implementing the New National Movement and rectifying the wartime national life, we should strictly ban them. It is learned that the municipal government has ordered the first and second police bureaus to close all dance schools by the end of June.</p>
<h3>Wishing for a Unified Reform of Customs</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Social customs regarding weddings, funerals, and celebrations have long tended toward extravagance. Even during this time of war, when frugality is advocated, luxury persists, and in some cases, even surpasses peacetime levels. It is imperative that we all strive for reform and restore proper customs. My personal view is as follows:</p>
<p>Joyous celebrations and funeral arrangements are originally private matters for individuals and families. While offering congratulations or condolences out of friendship is acceptable, it should never focus on ostentatious displays of material wealth. As the saying goes, "It's the thought that counts, not the gift," and sincere concern is more meaningful than lavish gifts. Given the current transportation difficulties and the busy schedules of many, even the absence of a physical presence should be perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>In practice, most current gift-giving customs are wasteful. For instance, flower baskets, wreaths, and banners with gilded characters are all impractical. Even the red paper used for wrapping is wasteful, consuming valuable resources. Therefore, we should advocate for refraining from sending gifts.</p>
<p>A more progressive approach recently adopted is to convert gifts into cash for charitable purposes. Taking advantage of festive occasions, gifts are converted into cash and donated to public welfare endeavors. This avoids extravagance and can be considered a win-win situation. However, in reality, many engage in converting gifts into cash for charity while still indulging in lavish displays. Moreover, the practice of converting gifts into cash should be subject to certain conditions. For example, it should only be appropriate for birthdays of individuals aged sixty or seventy and above, or for younger generations who have achieved success in their careers and made contributions to the country and society.</p>
<p>For friends facing difficult circumstances, generous cash gifts should be offered during weddings or funerals to express mutual support.</p>
<p>The above points are based on my personal observations of society. Especially now, as I prepare for my son's wedding, I am deeply troubled by the inquiries from relatives and friends about the date. Indulging in extravagant customs contradicts my long-held belief in wartime frugality, which is unacceptable to me in order to maintain consistency between my words and actions. Converting gifts into cash and donating them to public welfare is also inappropriate because my personal status and reputation are insufficient, and my son's wedding cannot be compared to the birthdays of elders. I dare not accept such gestures. However, the decision regarding my children's wedding cannot be made solely by me or one party. Therefore, I sincerely request that relatives and friends refrain from sending congratulatory gifts and avoid taking the trouble to visit. Even if gifts are sent, I will absolutely refuse to accept them. If you insist on attending, I will not provide any reception. This statement is made in the hope that you will show understanding and leniency.</p>
<h3>Residential Certificates in the Old Zhabei District to be Reissued Soon</h3>
<p>The method for exchanging residential certificates in the First District of the city has been approved by the First Bureau and the Baojia District. Starting this month, each branch bureau and Baojia section will be responsible for handling the exchange in the old First District and the newly merged areas of western Shanghai, in accordance with the Baojia regulations. After receiving notification from the Baojia head, residents should promptly proceed to the Baojia section of their respective branch bureau to complete the application procedures such as fingerprinting for the exchange. The first batch of residential certificates for the Zhabei District Baojia section has been processed and will be issued soon. Each Baojia head will be notified to inform residents to bring their original citizen identification cards to the section to exchange for the new residential certificates. Residents must exchange their certificates promptly upon receiving notification to expedite the process and ensure smooth completion in batches.</p>
<h3>Municipal Grain Bureau Rewards Land Reclamation and Planting</h3>
<p>In order to actively increase agricultural production in the city, the Municipal Grain Bureau has been ordered to maximize the development of idle and abandoned land in the near suburbs and rural areas of Shanghai. The bureau has established a task force to investigate idle and abandoned land and to encourage citizens to claim and cultivate it. With the approval of the Municipal Government, all previously uncultivated arable land, land previously cultivated but now abandoned, abandoned building foundations unsuitable for habitation, and wasteland can be claimed and cultivated by automatically applying to the Municipal Grain Bureau from today. The Municipal Government will grant priority rights to land reclamation to encourage agricultural production and increase national strength.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ogura, Economic Advisor, Visited Allied Military and Political Leaders Yesterday; Tea Party Welcoming Him from All Circles Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, visited the Japanese Embassy and Consulate in Shanghai, as well as the military and naval authorities, after arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. This was his first official visit after taking office. This afternoon (the 27th) at 4:00 PM, a welcoming tea party will be held at the Cathay Hotel by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. It is reported that financial, industrial, and commercial organizations in Shanghai have also scheduled tea parties to welcome him warmly and exchange views on economic development.</p>
<h3>Authorities Absolutely Prohibit Illegal Gold Speculation to Stabilize Finance and Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors in Shanghai that the buying and selling of gold are unrestricted, and prices are not limited, which has aroused serious attention from the public. In the past, the soaring prices in Shanghai were caused by the changes in gold and grain prices. The prices of all commodities were transferred based on the rise and fall of gold and grain prices. Among them, speculators manipulated and suffered greater influence. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the government authorities have been cracking down on illegal transactions of gold and grain to stabilize finance and suppress prices. First, the hoarding of grain was cracked down. Then, the gold trading market was cracked down. In recent years, the crackdown on off-market gold transactions has been even more severe. The authorities of Shanghai have repeatedly detained and warned illegal gold market brokers to eliminate the gold market group, and the finance has been stabilized. Now, there is a sudden rumor that gold can be freely bought and sold, and that prices are not limited. The general public feels doubtful. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the authorities, although the government authorities have not controlled gold, they will impose stricter penalties on those who engage in illegal gold trading or speculative manipulation in order to maintain finance and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>The 33rd Issue of Flour for Residents Outside of the First District Will Be Sold Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Grain Bureau's allocation of the 33rd issue of flour per capita for all districts other than the First District has been fully approved, and will be sold from today (the 27th) until the 2nd of next month. It is stipulated that each person can purchase one market catty at a price of 11 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. After the deadline, the flour certificates for this issue will be invalid and no longer reissued.</p>
<h3>Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing Will Be Implemented Uniformly in All Districts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Control Committee had already printed enough temporary cotton cloth purchase certificates, totaling 3,096,000, and sent them to the Municipal Government for distribution with the seal of the designated merchants. At that time, the Municipal Government had not yet shown the exact number of recent population, so it temporarily handled it based on the population statistics of 3,100,000 sent by the Baojia. Now that the Municipal Government has found that the population in all districts of Shanghai is 3,452,227, the Shanghai Commercial Control Committee has made up the shortage of 356,327 certificates and handed them over to the Cloth Industry Association to change the retailers and separately stamped them, and sent them to the Economic Bureau for distribution. At that time, all districts can be sold uniformly. The reports in yesterday's newspaper that the number of cloth certificates was printed according to the number of people in the First District and that additional printing was required were all untrue.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Increasing the Harvest Per Mu</h3>
<p>When the Supreme Economic Advisor, Mr. Ogura, answered reporters' questions the other day, he believed that in order to solve the problem of commodity prices, there must be two kinds of measures: one is to increase production, and the other is to reduce currency circulation. Because increasing production depends on the joint efforts of the government and the people, let's talk about increasing production.</p>
<p>Increasing production is naturally aimed at increasing the necessities such as food as the primary goal. Taking Europe in this World War as an example, the shortage of important food crops is being gradually supplemented every day, and what is of particular concern is to increase the yield per hectare in southeastern Europe to restore the average production of Europe. According to German calculations, if the yield per hectare in southeastern Europe can be increased to the current European average, then the food self-sufficiency of the European continent can be completed. We can put it another way: if the yield per mu in southeastern China can be increased to the current Chinese average, then China's food self-sufficiency can be completed.</p>
<p>However, to increase the output per mu in various parts of the country, it is only possible after obtaining sufficient labor, fertilizers, high-quality seeds, and complete agricultural machinery. Looking around the agricultural affairs in the country today, I am afraid that from now on, the yield per mu will not only be difficult to increase, but will even inevitably decrease, because a part of the labor has been transformed into "single helpers," a part of the rice and cotton seeds has been replaced by the seeds of beans and millet, and a part of the farm machinery has often been sold as waste metal to maintain life. Therefore, to achieve food self-sufficiency and increase the yield per mu, we must start adjusting from these realistic problems, and we must not ignore them because they are small.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces at Imphal Become Turtles in a Jar, Says Spokesman for Japanese Army Press Department</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai, China, at a routine press conference yesterday (the 26th) at 3:00 p.m., met with Chinese journalists from Shanghai and spoke of the importance of the great encirclement battle of Imphal, and strongly condemned the enemy's absurd counter-propaganda.</p>
<h3>Completion of Tight Encirclement</h3>
<p>The spokesman first said: After April 12, the military operations of the Japanese army have made more progress, completely concentrated on Imphal and Seirel, and completed the tight encirclement. The enemy forces in the heavy encirclement on all sides actually have the 17th Division, the 20th Division, the 23rd Division, and the Mechanized Brigade under the 4th Army, all of which have become turtles in a jar, waiting to be annihilated. If Imphal falls, the Japanese army can directly approach Manipur and cut off the railway from Assam to Bengal. The enemy is now relying on this railway to send reinforcements deeply to try to defend the important stronghold of Manipur. However, the speed of the Japanese army's multiple attacks was beyond the enemy's expectations. The Japanese army's powerful troops have now reached 30 kilometers from Manipur, which has greatly frightened the enemy.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Propaganda is Absolutely Absurd</h3>
<p>He then explained the reasons why Imphal had not yet fallen, saying: The Japanese army has not captured Imphal, which is the basis for the enemy's propaganda. The enemy had previously issued pessimistic views and boasted about the strong position and brave fighting of the Japanese army in Imphal and Kohima. Recently, because the Japanese army has not captured Imphal, it has come up with a new idea and made boring propaganda, saying that the Japanese army is in a state of stalemate and has lost its vigor. Therefore, some people have speculated that the Japanese army's progress in the past was rapid, and this time it was because the Japanese army had lost its vigor, or because the Anglo-American forces had strengthened their counter-offensive. Based on the military intelligence and strategic observations of Imphal, I strongly condemned the enemy's counter-propaganda as absolutely slight. Some people's speculation is purely the result of the wrong feeling after being subjected to the enemy's counter-propaganda. It is clear that Imphal and Bareil are trapped in the Japanese army's heavy siege. However, in view of the Japanese army's rapid progress in the past, it is inevitable that some enemies will slip through the net when occupying a place, so this time we are determined to annihilate them completely, without leaving a single soldier, and strive to eliminate the enemy's entire army. Therefore, this time we carefully and closely arranged the encirclement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Adopts New Field Tactics</h3>
<p>The enemy's main body is the mechanized brigade, equipped with quite excellent equipment. The Japanese army is mainly infantry, and mechanized units and artillery units are auxiliary. Therefore, all parties observe that Imphal is not easy to occupy. As a result, the Japanese army quickly occupied a part of it, and then quickly mobilized a large number of mechanized units. Now all the military equipment has been arranged, and Imphal will be captured in one fell swoop in the near future. The Japanese army uses field warfare to capture the fortress, deploys field warfare around the Imphal area, and arranges the encirclement like an iron barrel. The so-called encirclement is an ideal tactic, that is, outside the encirclement line, the enemy forces that escape from the part establish a new encirclement line. In this way, no enemy soldier will escape, and they will wait for the entire army to be annihilated. The Japanese army's patience this time is for a one-time solution, which has great significance in military and political terms. Occupying Imphal can be a stage for the Indian Northern Operation, and establish the foundation of the Free Indian Government. This time, the Japanese army's attack on Imphal is like a fisherman catching fish, quickly seizing the opportunity, carefully spreading the fishing net, quietly restraining the movement, and then it is not difficult to get a big fish easily.</p>

<h3>Method for Applying for Sublease License Should Be Improved</h3>
<p>— Wen Jingxian</p>
<p>The First District Office announced that the sublease license for second landlords should be obtained. If the deadline of April 15 is exceeded, a fine of one yuan per day will be imposed. I live in the western district, and my family are all women and children, and I have a job myself. Because the house I live in has a sublease relationship, in order to comply with the authorities' announcement, I have to ask for leave to handle this procedure.</p>
<p>I immediately filled out the application form and took the spring housing donation ticket to No. 1 Fanhuangbo Road (old Jessfield Road), the Western District Donation and Tax Office, designated in the announcement, to obtain the sublease license. About four or five hundred people lined up every day, but they were rejected for no reason for several days and were not allowed to issue the license, which was countless. There are so many people applying for licenses there every day, but the number of licenses issued is very small, only about ten or twenty or thirty numbers, and then it is announced that the licenses have been issued and stopped. Until the last day of the fifteenth, the doorman suddenly claimed that starting tomorrow, a fine of one yuan per day would be paid, and no more licenses would be issued here. When asked where to apply for it in the future, he ignored it. It really made people waste many days of precious time and ended up with nothing.</p>
<p>Checking the meaning of fines is to punish intentional or negligent behavior. If people abide by the law and go to get a license every day but cannot get it, they will be punished instead. It is not fair. The authorities should reconsider this kind of license issuance procedure and formulate a proper and convenient method. Or set a deadline, and at the same time, publish the application form format and paper size in the newspaper (or have the Baojia head check and forward it), so that the second landlord can write it according to the format, send it to the audit office by registered letter, and then the giving office will issue the date according to the arrival, and order the second landlord to come to collect the license. If there is a letter of request for those who do not come beyond the time limit, they will be punished and pay the fine according to the rules. In this way, people can be spared from traveling every day, and save the trouble of spending time, and can also prevent the staff from making things difficult and taking advantage of them.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>A real person seemed unable to accept such disturbances and stood alone on the deck at the stern of the ship.</p>
<p>That day's emotions surfaced again.</p>
<p>(That year, that month, armed and returned, show it a limit!)</p>
<p>This may be the emotion harbored by all cadets, but the real person's heart, although similar to this, is different.</p>
<p>He was recalling the imposing fleet of the United States at that time. When he stared at that fleet in the car, he felt an unspeakable joy, that his side's spirit was far superior to it. In the eyes of a real person who had the honor of being a second-dan in Judo, the other side had a big "defect."</p>
<p>(If that's the case, what's there to be afraid of?)</p>
<p>He deeply remembered this in his heart. However, he did not ask anyone. In fact, it was not something to tell others.</p>
<p>Now he is on the verdant sea, secretly recreating the impression of that day in his heart. His mind is as cold and transparent as ice, while the fire in his heart is burning fiercely.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in front of his eyes, a faint black shadow appeared again in the waves. Sharks were swimming again. A big fish about two fathoms up and down, with a silver belly on the left and right, was flying violently. The real person counted the number of sharks with his eyes. Some seemed not to be counted and dived into the water, but there were nine sharks. He seemed to forget everything and only stared at the sharks. Then his body was slowly dragged into the water. The surrounding area turned into an emerald green world. He saw the light blue and white fine sand on the seabed. He turned into a shark. The sharks lined up in a team, quietly and silently, and moved forward towards the pearl -</p>
<p>Suddenly, he noticed that his body was still on the deck. After the illusion disappeared, the sea surface was only floating with endless traces of waves. I don't know when, this ship has already started to move.</p>
<h3>Liu Kuizhong's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wu Weng</p>
<p>This spring, Shanghai's traditional Chinese painting circles have been particularly full of flower painting exhibitions. After Wang Yachen's "Goldfish" exhibition, there was the exhibition of Bailongshanren Wang Yishi's son, Ji Mei, who also won with flower paintings. From the 25th, Liu Kuizhong's exhibition was held at the Chinese Painting Gallery.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese painters are often calligraphers, because the use of brushstrokes and bone structure in traditional Chinese paintings must come from the training of jinfa. Therefore, those who are good at calligraphy must be able to write, which has become a common principle. Mr. Liu is a flower painter and a calligrapher at the same time. The reason for his success cannot be an exception to the above. If you don't believe it, look at his works this time, isn't he a genius in both medicine and painting?</p>
<p>After studying Zhongding Seal Script, Mr. Liu obtained the foundation for using brushstrokes, and then went on to write Han and Wei steles. He obtained a strong momentum. Therefore, the style of freehand brushwork composed of sparse and upright, old and simple lines is naturally used on the painting.</p>
<p>His flower paintings do not win by delicate workmanship, neatness, beauty, or density. Although it is related to his medical skills, his unique personality, a kind of heroic temperament of a northerner, cannot be compared with the gentle endowment of a southerner. This can be seen in his calligraphy and can be proved in his paintings.</p>
<p>Starting from this point of view, Mr. Liu, in the process of traditional Chinese painting creation, does not tend to the first-class of the court style meticulous brushwork, but immerses himself in the style of the masters of the Qing Teng Baiyang to Li Futang Wang Chaolin, which is not accidental. The styles of these masters of the Ming and Qing dynasties originated from Chinese literati paintings, and they are also the essence of Chinese flower paintings.</p>
<p>Among the exhibitions this time, such as "Rose", "Nandina", and "Machine", not only are they unrestrained and refined, and bold and unrestrained, but also in the realm of brushwork, ink, and composition, they have created a new path.</p>

<h3>Should Students' Parents Pay the "Anatomy Classroom Fee"?</h3>
<p>Recently, the Southeast Medical College, in order to "restore the anatomy classroom," has collected a fee of 1,000 yuan from each student's parent and must be paid within ten days, otherwise they will not be allowed to participate in the exam. Since the incident, the school's equipment has been destroyed and simplified, which has an impact on educational efficiency. Moreover, anatomy is the main course of medical science, so it is not a bad thing to raise funds to rebuild the classroom to benefit students' experiments. However, at a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, it is not easy for parents to bear the cost of their children going to school. Compared with the extra cost, except for a very few wealthy parents, it is difficult to bear. Moreover, the "restoration of the anatomy classroom" was originally the school's own problem, and students' parents have no obligation to bear this fee. Even if the school is close to the economy and has to discuss it with students' parents, it should also send someone to explain it and add donations according to the parents' ability and week, but it cannot specify the amount and send it within a time limit. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities will take into account the difficulties of the parents and find other good strategies, then the students will be fortunate and the parents will be fortunate. (Respectfully submitted by parent Wu Guangxin).</p>
<h3>Clearing Accumulated Water in Streets and Alleys</h3>
<p>The drains in the areas of Yanhai Road, Shipi Lane, Menghua Street and Da Shun Li Main Street in Nanshi have been silted up for a long time, and water has accumulated in the streets and alleys, forming canals. It is now summer, and the stench is unbearable, making it extremely easy to breed mosquitoes and flies. Each household sent a letter to Chengyi Accounting Firm, but there was no solution. Therefore, I hope that the health authorities will pay attention and find a way to dredge them as soon as possible to prevent the spread of cancer and emphasize hygiene. (Tenant Hao Ji)</p>
<h3>Changzhou Fellow Association Provides Free Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, our association has established a National Medicine Clinic (address is at Changzhou Fellow Association, No. 6, Lane 102, Zhengyang Road (Tongfu Road)), which provides medical treatment and medicine from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day, and is open as usual on Sundays. People who seek medical treatment only need to bring their citizen identification card. If they are fellow villagers, they can come to the clinic for treatment without taking any money. I am now enclosing 200 free medical treatment tickets, and I respectfully hope that you will give them away, Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Association</p>
<h3>Giving Away "New Treatise on Measles"</h3>
<p>It is now spring, and measles is most easily spread. Pediatric expert Mr. Zhang Juying, in view of this, has entrusted this office to give away his book "New Treatise on Measles". The book describes the symptoms, care, and treatment in detail. Patients who read this book will be able to know how to deal with the illness when they are sick, so that they will not take the wrong medicine. Those who want to ask for it, please attach a postal stamp of 50 cents and send a letter to this office, and it will be sent immediately. There are not many doctors, so it will be given away when it is finished.</p>
<h3>Charity Association for Child Welfare Donation Deadline at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association's fundraising campaign for this year's orphaned children's education and care expenses has already received over 1.5 million yuan in donations. This amply demonstrates the enthusiasm of people in society for caring for children, which is truly admirable. As the current fundraising campaign of the association is coming to an end on the 30th of this month, with only a few days remaining, and the donations are still 500,000 yuan short of the target, the association earnestly hopes that all sectors of society will continue to assist in fundraising, so that the work can be completed, and the benefits to the orphaned children will be truly significant.</p>
<h3>Lost Borrowed Items</h3>
<p>Records: On April 16th, a box of records was lost by a friend in French Park. As these records were borrowed from a certain electrical appliance store, especially the ten Western music records, which are impossible to purchase, I am making one last effort, hoping for sympathy and assistance. If any upright gentleman knows their whereabouts, please kindly inform me, and I will be extremely grateful. Contact Mr. Zhang Ruxin at No. 49, Lane 103, Bingxing Road, or No. 17, Jingu Village, Father Jin Road.</p>
