<h3>社評　癥結何在？</h3>
<p>昨天大陸新報（譯文見今日本版）載稱：二月十九日，渝蔣在其發起之新生活運動十周紀念會中，向統治下的民衆作廣播演詞，直認「抗戰」以前新生活運動頗具成續，「抗戰」以後，因戰時的困難，社會道德受到不良影響，迨民二十九年後，物價騰踊，較戰前超過百倍，於是國民道德的墮落，正與物價騰貴成反比例，即物價騰貴二倍，則國民道德墮落二倍，現在因為物價騰貴了百倍，所以國民道德或許也墮落了百倍，這是國民的一大恥辱。假使更繼統墮落下去，則「抗戰建國」的成功要絕望了。</p>
<p>其實，自從前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動以後，自從去年春間日本開始改變對華新政策以後，自從去年十一月大東亞各國會議發表宣言五原則以後，大東亞各國的共存共榮，東亞人的東亞的形勢，巳經很為顯明。所以，重慶方面執拗不悟，繼續拖戰行動的理論根據，早已不復存在。業已失却理論根據的拖戰行動，當然是盲目的危險行動。由此以觀，渝蔣指出的重慶民衆道德墮落與物價騰責成為反比例的背馳，實為勢所必然的結果。</p>
<p>然而，造成重慶國民道德墮落與物價騰貴成反比例的，究竟癥結何在？究竟是誰的實任呢？我們可以　　，主要癥結在於重慶方面的政治不良。惟其政治趨於黑暗墮落，足以驅使國民道德的墮落；惟其政治趨於黑暗墮落，足以促使物價的騰踊。而造成政治不良的責任，當然應由重慶方面的領導分子所担負的。因政治不良而造成國民道德墮落與物價騰踊的現象，渝蔣並不反省從改良政治着想，而怨尤民衆，又是不中用的廢話而已。</p>
<p>不過，我們在和平區內的人民，想到重慶物價勝漲原因，在於政治不良之外，尙有周圍物瓷遭受封鎖，以及土地貧瘠，物產缺乏等等其他因素。而和平區內的物價騰貴，比較重慶且有過之而無不及，那末，和平區內是富庶之區，物產豐饒，交通亦並未阻斷。依照常識判斷，物價高漲，決不應與重慶比賽。這其間的癥結何在？實已不待說明而概可想見了。渝蔣對此現象，尙知「我們的成功」之絕望。而和平區內有此現象，更何能擔負大事亞後方基地的責任，何能克盡參戰的義務呢？</p>
<p>於此，我們不辭重申一貫主張，就是政府絕對需要建立好人政府，從速革新政治，消弭過去因政治不良而造成的畸形現象。同時，我們始終認定經濟危機決非經濟力量單獨可以挽救，而非以革新政治為前提决不為功。這是値得重複提出，以供朝野共同注意的。</p>
<h3>民心厭戰的焦慮　渝蔣廣播詞中盡情反映　大陸新報引言</h3>
<p>本月十九日爲重慶政權新生活運動十周年紀念日，蔣介石作廣播演講，顯爲「吿全國同胞」。他在度播中首先說：「回顧過去十年聞的成績，實不勝慚愧」。自民國二十六年以來，遭遇戰爭的困難，社會道德墮地：過去三年來的物價，昂騰至戰前的百餘倍。同時，國民道德則比例地低落。他就戰時社會層的混亂狀態，向民衆投以悲痛的言辭，企圖促起消沉的思想重趨激昂，並具體的要求民衆獻出物力與勞力，向不及喘息的民衆要求更大的犧牲。該演詞的主旨是戰爭七年來逐漸形成的戰爭思想之消沉及戰時財政的破綻，他對民衆思想的動向，更表示非常隱痛的苦悶，「長此以往，戰爭將吿崩潰，」對於因東亞周圍的情勢而漸次覺悟，背離民衆，極表悲憤慷慨，而大聲疾呼，再驅之於戰爭。蔣介石以前從未大胆率直地陳述戰時社會層的現狀，而要求民衆的覺醒，由此可窺蔣介石以下指導層的苦悶，我們從蔣介石向民衆直陳拖戰將臨末日的演詞中，可以看出重慶治下現在的動向與今後的方向。</p>
<p>蔣廣播詞要旨</p>
<p>在新生活十周年的今日，撫今迫昔，實不勝慚愧。若千地方的熱情，由濃厚而漸趨淡薄，若干地方猶未實行，一般社會依然充滿着蕪雜汚　，在個人如此，在家庭更如此。改善生活的話不聽見談起，大都市如此，鄕村不難想像。這樣，我們拿什麽來和別的民族講平等，怎樣可以生存於現世界。我提倡新生活運動已經十年，到今天還不能排除這障碍，實不勝慚愧。提然而自從民國二十六年全面戰爭發動以後，因戰時的困難，社會道德受到不良的影響，目至民國二十九年，物價騰貴，幾達戰前的百倍以上。在這裏，國民道德逐漸低下，正與物價的騰貴成反比例。即物價如騰貴二倍，則國民道德低落二倍。現在因為物價騰貴了約白倍，所以國民道德或許也低落了百倍。這是國民的一個大恥辱，也是戰爭歷史上的汚點。我吿訴儲君，假使更繼續低落下去，則我們的成功要絕望了。要强化實力，安定物價，復歸舊態，可以從下述三方面着手：　政府澈底的統制物價。　社會有力人士，忍苦耐勞，根據自愛自重的精神，互相監督誘導。　全體人民基於愛國心克服私利私慾的觀念，自動的協力政府的物價政策。</p>
<p>除以上物質與精神兩方面的改革之外，尙有應該覺醒的一點，即新生活運動最主要的意義，使國民克盡戰時中的義務。現在提出兩項希望各位實行</p>
<p>勤勞節約　本年的主要任務爲增加生產及節約消費。這是國民應盡的最基本的任務，假使內增加生產所得的充作個人的享樂，徒然成為增加消耗，浪費物資。假使把節約所得的放入自己囊中，徒然製造遊資，破壞社會經濟。故增加生產，節約消費所得的，應自動獻納於國家，供作職責。關於澈底實施節約儲蓄，切望每月每戶節約國幣百元，或收入總額的三成以上。</p>
<p>義務勞働的實施義務勞働法巳在去年十二月頒布。中國沒有資本，但有許多的人力，這是我國的主要資本。各地人民對所在地的義務勞働爲每年十日。我們沒有資金可以交給各地，但我們假使拿勞力來產生資本，拿勞力來蓄積資本，則可以提高地方經濟，强化地方自治的效能，培養雄厚的國家實力。（翔：譯自二月二十四日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>阿拉坎綫作戰　步入新階段　印度國民軍收穫戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據緬甸前綫日軍某基地電，印度國民軍最高司令部二十一日曾發表於阿拉坎戰綫印國民軍之赫赫戰果，其中以印度國民軍挺身部隊所獲之戰果最大，該部隊於那基安央附近曾與日軍共同突入敵陣中，奮戰後，更担任遮斷英第七師敗軍之退路工作，冒敵戰鬥機之攻擊，自敵大軍中衝出，炸毀該方面唯一之橋樑，使英第七軍敗走無路，完全入於包國網，頃更向波利巴札方面前進中。又印國民軍另一部隊曾渡馬猶河，殲滅敵第七師之印度兵將兵若干名，繼更自頓古巴札方面向敵後方地區突進，是時復有多數印度兵陸續投降，亦獲極大戰果。由於該部隊之此次作戰，使印度作戰已踏入新階段，故頗堪注目，敵東南亞洲軍總司令部及奧賓列克防衛軍內部已呈極大之動搖。故彼等為阻止該印度國民軍之活躍，曾於距某地若十公里之地點出動非洲土人軍展開防禦戰，然以區區之土人軍絕難轉換戰局。印度十六日中央議會席上，印防術軍司令官奧賓列克曾發表戰况稱：第七軍瀕於崩潰之說，乃為敵軍之虛偽宣傳，日軍之意圖，乃在使緬印戰綫之我軍勢力趨微，並使重要基地崩潰，彼等並無進入印度之意圖，此不外為彼欲掩飾此次大敗戰之謀略，其對印國民軍之活躍毫未提及，此足證敵惟恐因印國民軍之活動，而影響印度軍民動搖。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　緬甸前綫電，於印緬戰綫協力日軍作戰之印度國民某部隊，英勇奮戰，業佔領布其頓東方之某高地，同時英印軍隊期待印國民軍進擊之印人將校所指揮之部隊，已呈分裂狀態，致敵陣營發生極大之騷動。又深入敵方協力日軍切斷塞加賓及納蓋總庫間敵方道路之印國民軍，正向敵司令部進攻中。同時，印國民軍某有力部隊亦開始活動，因此英方所感壓迫益形深刻，故英印當局倍形狼狽，刻下芷極力施展其懷柔及彈壓之技倆。</p>
<h3>華北各地　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>北平二十四日中央社電　華北日軍最近掃蕩各地共匪收獲莫大戰果，冀中日軍曾於本月十八日接獲張北莊保安隊與共匪一百五十人交戰之報吿後，即火速駛往，協力在高莊西北攻擊共匪，擊斃其泰半，是役共匪遣屍六十八具，日軍截獲捷克機關槍一挺，步槍二十六枝，及其他軍火甚多。又是日另一隊日軍在孟家莊安平西南方十五公里，曾擊潰共匪遊擊隊，共匪遺屍三十七具，被俘二十人。二十日日軍夜襲霍賓台冷泉，殲滅共軍第三十六團之一部，共軍遺屍三十七具，被俘十人，日軍鹵獲步槍十六枝，子彈二四六發，手溜彈三十八枚。又於十五日拂曉日軍急襲南汪莊叵井（唐山南十四公里）與偽縣府保安隊二十餘人交戰，激戰一小時左右，即將其擊潰，是役共軍遺屍十五具，被俘二人，日軍鹵獲步槍八枝，子彈四百五十發，手溜彈三十五枚。</p>
<h3>芬外長報告　外交局勢</h3>
<p>赫爾辛基二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：芬蘭外長索姆賽，昨在國會外交委員會會議席上，曾報吿外交政治局勢。</p>
<h3>斯達林要求　聞第二戰綫</h3>
<p>莫斯科二十四日中央社電　蘇軍最高司令斯達林元帥於蘇軍成立二十六週年紀念日之二十三日，照例對全軍將土發出布吿時，指出現在蘇軍於作戰上依然需要第二戰綫，要求英。美兩國從速開闢，歷史敎訓吾人，德國於正面戰綫作戰，必常獲勝利，若於兩戰錢作戰，則常失敗。此次大戰德車係於一戰綫作戰，故反軸心軍力若開始新另一方面活動，反軸心全面强化對德軍之壓迫，則德國必將遭遇重大事態。蘇軍全體將土勿因過去之成功而自驕，應正確估計德國之實力，歷史指示吾人，敵人决不自趨破滅之深淵，故吾人為爭取勝利，應迫使敵人進入危亡之途，因此余命令全軍，一，蘇軍全體將土應訓練軍事技術，嚴守軍紀。二，蘇軍將校應硏究指揮技術，啓發部屬智能。</p>

<p>阿姆斯達丹二十四日中央社電　據倫敦消息，星期三英外相文登在下院發表，謂英、美巳向西班牙提出數種要求，但其內容並不損害西班牙之主　，談判現仍在馬德里進行。艾登復言，倘非吾人自願為之，無人能强迫吾人放棄其有限之汽油。</p>
<p>日內瓦二十四日中央社電　英左翼急進派論壇報發表，反軸心國對西括西屬北非地區之丹吉爾地方之國際共管，政治犯之全部大赦，容納贊助重建共和政體之西班牙人民，撤銷對西報紙之檢查、規定實行自由及普遍之選舉之日期，弗朗哥將軍或不接受此項條件。該報稱：倘音人歡迎另一西班牙政府，則吾人有强力之武器，即無綫電廣播及小冊子是也。英駐西大使賀爾從未使用此種方法，但時至今日，行動之時機巳至矣，英國之勞工運動將負起領導責任，而與西班牙一次淸算，且對現統治西班牙，阿根廷，洪牙利，芬蘭之「佛朗哥」，亦為决算之時期也。</p>

<h3>東綫戰况</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員浦拉托稱：德軍在東綫　特斯克·羅夫諾·杜白諾三角地內反攻，今已進抵魯特斯古城，該地區之蘇聯騎兵，因其給養路綫延長，而迭受德軍襲擊，故情形極為險惡。德軍進展之結果，已征服敵軍之抵抗，現正從事殲滅敵方之强餘訓練。北路與南路之德軍，現仍續在調整陣綫，加以引直，南路德軍退出克里伏羅格城後，蘇軍即挾其新銳，企圖向南面　伯河口推進。其他各路敵軍之進攻，僅屬局部性質，志在擾亂德軍之行動而已，蘇軍進攻鬆弛，顯在準備大規模之攻勢、蓋吾軍已偵悉敵在後方尤其在中路，調動頻繁。北路戰事沉寂，該處積雪，有三十至四十公分之深。</p>

<h3>日趨激烈的太平洋决戰　日軍大保本適營課海長</h3>
<p>— 原大佐</p>
<p>敵軍哈爾塞西南太平洋　隊我滿懷野望，類一舉突破南太平洋的戰略要點新不列顛島拉巴兩，自去年十月底至十一月間，接連在玻根維爾島周邊海城出擊，然而經日海軍部隊，尤其是航空部隊的巧妙勇敢的邀擊，遭受教命打擊以來，敵軍為朦混其敗續與打開該方面的僵局起見，乃有迅即計劃新的反攻作戰之必要。敵軍以登陸特羅基納　，巳達到了作戰目的為強辦，一方面對於艦艇的重大損失，却仍用厚顔無恥的一套手段，加以捷教，</p>
<p>尼米茲的反攻</p>
<p>美國太平洋體司令長官尼米茲，在第二次玻根維爾處海上空戰後，於十一月十日海軍百六十周年紀念那天磅稱：「美國在最近的將來，將對日軍展開大攻勢，把其鳥嶼要塞粉碎無遺。」由此亦可見敵軍的　燥。尼米茲再於十八日揚言將在吉爾貝特羣島實施登陸作戰，他道：「日軍不能不知道最近美軍將在中部太平洋戰綫發動大攻勢。」於是自十一九日以來，以航空母艦為中心，大約是尼的大艦隊，大舉出擊吉爾貝特羣島方面的海域，敵海兵部隊遂於二十一日在馬金和達拉瓦島登陸，在這兩島的日軍守備隊，尊不壯烈奮戰，一方面日軍潛水艇和海軍航空部隊，　者惡省天氣，日以寡敵衆，戰至二十九日止，攻擊前來進攻的敵軍機動部隊，與停泊在馬金島的敵耀船，尤其其對敵航空母艦羣，，予以猛烈的攻擊，然而敵軍對於該方面，也僅發表馬金？達拉瓦兩島的登陸作戰，至於艦艇的損失卻依然　績「秘不發表」的態度。</p>
<p>是二月五日，敵軍　　馬紹兩羣島方面，並　　上飛機，來戰日本基也，因美軍對罵金，達拉兀兩島的接濟，常受日內南洋基地的航空兵力所威　，敵軍無論如何，為要確保該兩島，非先行發動，擊潰日軍不可，因此才不得不前來侵襲，但這反彼日航空部隊所包當，使其機動部隊的中心航空母艦二艘喪失。尼米茲艦隊之對中太平洋的新攻勢·與南太平洋哈爾塞艦隊的出擊·有着密切的關聯·那是極其顯然的。但是尼米茲的攻勢，並不是因為不能一舉現克服拉巴爾的企圖，才實施這失敗的牽制作戰，對於這點·決不可忽視的。這次的攻勢可說與南太平洋的反攻作戰並肩，為敵軍誇稱太平洋總反攻的最重要之一環</p>
<p>對拉巴爾的野心</p>
<p>敵美國自開戰以來，迭遭慘敗，最近始漸見起色，其計　反攻日軍的且標，可分三項如下：第一，奪回日木在南方的資源地帶。第二攪亂生產，以期直接攻繫日本土。第三，敵軍想攻　破壞日方的海上交通綫，以阻礙日資源地帶與日本土生產地帶的聯繫，和前綫的接濟，第一項奪回資源地帶的反攻，始自去年八月瓜達喀納島登陸作戰一役，自此以後，敵軍賴基地航空力量的優勢，在所羅門，新幾內亞展開了所謂一跳島」的作戰，敵軍開始反攻作戰的第一理由是·美國　澳洲的經絡綫·勢將被戰斷，所以非在最后的一綫，加以維持持不可。不國其重大的理由是地理的條件，因為該方面有無數的島嶼相近昆連着，開戰以還約半年之間，敵軍已喪失戰前所有的航空母艦之一大部份，現在祗恃其航空兵力數量的優勢下配開戰事，因此除確保基地之外，別無方法。所以傾注作戰的主力於能夠展開大基地航空兵力的島嶼附近之海上。於是在所羅門，新幾內亞方面展開莫大的基地航空兵力，過去一年來，在其所掌握的制空　之下。徐徐向日軍戰略要點拉巴爾　績推進。</p>
<p>開時在這一年餘的時間，也就是重整航空母艦陳營的「時聞」在這期間，敵軍拼命努力建設航空母艦，迨至秋間，其重整的航空母艦棟營，亦已略如所願。</p>
<p>於是敵軍便計劃和南太平洋作戰不同的·非用航空母艦的航空兵力不可的中太平洋反攻作戰——即以攪亂日本土的生產為目標的新攻勢，去年秋間敵軍對大島島及南島島的大規模轟炸，可說是一個前哨戰事。</p>
<p>同時在所羅門的跳島作戰，亦巳接近最後目標拉巴爾，即將進入最後的階段了。</p>
<p>如上所述，中太平洋戰事與南太平洋戰事一樣·其展開新攻勢的作戰時機，自然漸漸地成熟起來，但敵軍　施這兩大反攻作戰，與世界戰后的現階段相配合看來，其主要目標大概可推察如下：即敵軍在南太平洋，無諭如何一舉欲突破拉巴爾，一方面在中太平洋，欲獲得吉爾貝特羣島為第一步的根據地，威脅日本的內南洋，而確立能攻擊日本本土的戰略陣勢。敵軍希望在聖　節以前，獲得這兩大成果，於是一面誇大宣傳蘇聯在歐洲東綫的攻勢。及　績大舉轟炸德國·所及於戰力的莫大影響等，一方面強力地展開議會談等的政治謀略攻勢。戰事禁入第二年·美國便施行第三年勝利的宣傅·這可說是耀斯　的癡人說夢</p>
<p>空母戰術失敗</p>
<p>然而敵海軍在中太平洋，也不能不嘗到太平洋舉塞的日軍之實力的答覆。四次的吉爾員特　島海域空戰及馬紹爾羣　附近的空中戰役，敵軍航空母艦的損失與毀壤達十三艘，若再加玻根維爾易周邊海域凡六次的損失十一艘間，敵軍航空母艦陣營的損失實極可觀，尤其是人的損失更多。</p>
<p>然而目十月底以來，不過四十多天的短期間中，南太平洋展開七次的海航空戰，中太平洋　　展開五次的航空戰事，這些事實說明，戰局巳日趨設重，不必再加費述了。</p>
<p>但是，敵軍雖　受重大的損害，尚在南太平洋吉爾貝特轉附近登陸，一方面在中太平洋馬金，　固根據地，並準備着新的進攻。後來所及表示的出擊該方面的姿勢，乃是很　明的　實。敵軍或許要說，艦艇的重大損失，為了要獲得根據地·是不得巳的犧牲。甚至因使其自信其生產力量。</p>
<p>不僅如此，從這次前來攻擊所羅門，吉爾貝特戰役以前，敵航空母艦的陳容看來。仍有相當的數量。並不能看到日軍的大戰國，而只營樂觀的。</p>
<p>總之，吉爾具特羣島四次的空戰與馬紹爾羣島的空戰，證實太平洋的日軍要賽·堅如鐵壁，兆後無論敵軍　其航空母艦　　之多，反覆發動反攻，在日軍堅固陸勢之　，不過徒供犧牲而已，這是可以斷言的。該方面的日軍在戰略上的布陣，其羣固目不待守吉，由吉爾貝特羣島，　黑　爾羣島的開役經騐，日流軍航空部隊，亦發揮了無比的強力，在或黃　或夜間極困難的條件之下，勇敢準確地完成任務的同後土·其技能之超羣不消說，但擊沉的航空母艦中，除可明白地認淸其　型的以外，尙有昨多別種型式的航空母鏗。敵軍在開戰後·經過　　的體騐，教力改營的航空母艦的型式，這樣大量的敵敗，可見日買魚雷性質的優秀。這種事實，雖然不大引起人們的注目，但可謂這次所收戰果的重要意飬之一。</p>
<p>馬金島社烈戰</p>
<p>最後我們對於吉爾貝時，馬紹爾羣島方面海域的日軍偉大戰國·時刻不能忘記的是，在馬金，達拉瓦兩島奮勇挺戰的日軍守備　了。日如大本營所發表。因該兩島的通訊斷絕·對於後來的戰門情形，尚不能詳知。但據外國廣播·亦可窺　這兩島日軍守備隊的壯烈　　情形。敵方發表稱，比瓜達喀那島更要重大損失，或說：為海兵隊創設以來，死傷數量最多者。他們說這些話，事實上不僅因為敵方遭受重大的損害，並上想把道些發表，來掩敝艦艇的損失，其勝有政治性面日軍守備隊在這兩孤島上，又無森林，不過爲平坦的　固礁上，應付數多勢　的敵軍，其英勇團們，懷　據然，亦可推想而知。</p>
<p>我們對其英勇挺戰，表心表示敬意，同時應該多運飛機，　前綫將兵在太平洋的鐵　陣容，更　獲得偉大的戰績。那麼，一海運力損的張強化充，乃是先决問題，其中包含　後方的生產，由接濟充　偶勝，如果十二分有效地完送　偶任務，則羅斯福所呼喊的「勝利之第三年一，乃屬於我樂。（宏　自十二月二十六日號朝日週刋）</p>
<h3>女醫座談會</h3>
<p>就學於女子醫專的中國女學生，　　備宿舍舍監河合先生，　行座談會。她們然烈地透露愛國的情緒，發表如下的話：</p>
<p>決戰下的日本女性</p>
<p>倪家蓉（二十四歲。農東）决戰下的日本小姐們·的確活動得很好。看到了雷車上公共汽車上女職員凜凜然的服務樣十，令人胸中油然生出無限的信賴和尊敬，不絕還加入頭來。最近。據說還加入了襲造飛機和戰時軍需品增產戰綫，但中國的女性頭腦古舊，竟認依靠男子是女人的特輪，一點不想一工作。我們　國以後。打算將中國女性奪體制的思想統統打破。在決戰之下，中國女性優哉游載的生活方式是對的嗎？我相信這一定是不應該的。</p>
<p>周華春（二十三歲，）福建）日木的學生與正和　。我們回到寄宿舍以後，要預備四小時光景的功課。她們眞比同胞姊妹一達親熟地照顧我們，有不懂的地方，向她們討教時沒有不盡心指教的。我們可以全心全意地相信日本人。</p>
<p>改良中國應從家庭做起</p>
<p>王淑（二十一歲·河南）日本人士價喜歡淸潔哪！中國的　庭總是不健康的，好像病魔的憲。我想我們必須先改良家產生活、因此，在都會的醫院中服務，或在都市裏設立診所，好雖然好，但是，我想，總得像日木一樣組織巡廻診療班等等，從事鄉村的保健工作。努力普及衛生思想。</p>
<p>多多造就女醫</p>
<p>西（二十二歲，江蘇）的確，中國人的衛生歡忿是　薄的。就是生了病。也以為信仰與符咒等可以治病，不大　　看醫生。尤其是女子，她們總不大顧意呌男醫生看病。從道一點看來，中國固然需要男醫生，但是也有造就許多女醫生的必要。日本在窮鄉也有　院，保健所，診遼所等，但在中國，一到鄉下，差不多全是無醫材！雖然有些地方也有英美系的病院。診療所，不過，政府當局核日本也有考慮這點的必要吧。</p>
<p>王玉珍（十九歲，河北）關於日本的婦道，巳從吉罔校畏先生和舍監河合先生那裹學了不少，我相信日本的婦道也可成為中國的　道，東亞的歸道。在溫柔中含者強烈的母愛，對丈夫的眞心，以及督起於職業戰綫的雄心，這三種優美的歸遭，都歸給到「至誠愛國」四字</p>
<p>最後吉岡女史下這樣的結語道：</p>
<p>醫學的學衛方面固然也要緊。但關於日木婦道。是特別致力教致的。造成適於現實社會的女性，我想是比茶遺生花等形式上的東西更要緊。我們的道　教育如果結實，能對中日國結稍有　益，那是不勝欣慰的·好號教育中國的學生，就是我們的心　。（吉：釋自二月二日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>德國的歐洲相北部要塞圖</h3>
<p>自從英美發出了「第二戰綫」的空頭支票以來，差不多巳一年半以」了。直購今日歸止，英美袖手坐視蘇聯苦戰，不欲實行眞正的西歐第二戰綫。但最近德黑蘭會談的結果，英美卒屈服於蘇聯的壓力之前·關於西歐致。總又發表總司令官艾森霍華以不反軸心侵歐軍首腦的人選，不問英美方面是否顧意，西歐第二戰綫的結成是勢所必然的了。</p>
<p>對此，德國方面已有萬全的準備，北起挪威南至比萊納山脈，蜿　四千五百公里之間，布置重砲七千七百門，平射砲三千門。全海岸敷設機霞數百萬，更在重耍海岸構築千所以上的要塞陣地，在其背後組細複雜的防術編，隨時隨地能急派有力的機被化部隊。</p>
<p>據敵方的觀測，此等要塞陣地，如水泥鋼骨建成的數層大廈一樣，長四至六哩，其防壁不能用近代的火砲攻破。</p>
<p>這大規獲的「大西洋防壁」，平均深人內陸四十公里。這中問有無數戰鬥機用的小飛行塲，在內陸更有重轟炸機，急降轟炸機用的大飛行塲。</p>
<p>要塞地帶劃分許多小區域，各區置有降洛傘，特別　戒部隊。除要塞內的警備隊。觀　隊。砲兵隊。空中基地警備隊·沿岸機關槍隊·信號兵·電信·機械化斥　隊之外，前哨要地並配有戰車部隊及突擊部隊。但防衛軍的主力則在更遠的後方，那裹有數百輛戰車待機中，準備對突破此要者酬以砲火的洗禮。</p>
<p>這裹所刋載的國，可是北法狄埃浦。波洛果之間約九十六公里的「大西洋要塞」一部之想像圖。前方海面有德國潛水艦。水雷艇·高射砲艇在游弋着，沿岸密佈水雷，再進有鐵絲網的防壁。觀測塔·列車砲。深入內陸，掘有縱橫交錯的戰車壕，並有巨砲，高射砲陣地，第二攻列車砲陣。繼之為前進空軍基地，在其後方為大戰車，步兵集結地，更後為大空軍基地。鐵桶般的配備，一目瞭然。闊僅三十二一公里的英法海峽，今正嚴陣相時中。（譯自一月二十日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>慧姑</h3>
<p>— 朱麟</p>
<p>和慧姑不見已七年多了</p>
<p>她鮮明的英姿常在我的意念裏閃現，像傅奇英雄的站在我面前。</p>
<p>七年以前，正是時局動　得很厲害的年頭，以文章和口才著稱的　姑，正被推為蘇州　聯會的主一席團主席，在那一時期的「愛國學潮」中，以不可一世的氣慨領導着全城的學生運動。</p>
<p>時代的亂動，　　着幼小的靈魂，還在小學六年級念書的我，由於慧姑的啓發與影響。曾使我參與了偉大的學生行列。當不止一次看見慧姑站在羣衆面前發表慷概激昂的演說時，我會懷着多大的講傲與喜悅啊　囚她生動有力的號召而　起的巨電似的掌擊，好像還清晰地響在我的耳孕裹。</p>
<p>少年時代、憑姑給了我太多的影響，她鋒利的筆，和她辛辣的口才一樣，大膽勇猛地對不合理的舊時代予以無情的進擊，她撥亮了我的眼睛，豐富了我的思想，也充實了我的生活，直到我升入中學，她始終不疲倦地給狄許多帮助與　勵，使我在思想認識和寫作技巧上都獲得了相當的啓發。</p>
<p>戰爭把我們分開了。</p>
<p>音訊的隔絕並沒有抹去了我對她的印象，　輕的傳述，有人說起她結了婚，但，傳聞袛增加了更多的懷想，不僅因為她是私的姑姑，更由於她是我崇拜的英雄。</p>
<p>秋天裏，我懷着極度的與奪應接「慧姑和新姑夫回來了」的喜訊。據三叔說：他們在南陽路頂了一幢相當闊氣的房子，姑夫爲人很能幹·二個男孩都狠可愛。</p>
<p>當晚，我　着太多的執的想像。奢望着從　姑那兒去聽取許多可喜可愕的偉大經歷，也揣測者新姑夫應該是一位怎樣英俊的人物。</p>
<p>可是，重見的第一個印象使我幾乎不相信自己的限睛。站在面前的慧姑，祇是一個以華麗的服飾包裹着像一般少奶奶特有的豐滿體驅的女人，從滿臉脂粉中，我不能發現一點當年的氣概，除了覺得她變得很世故以外，正忠平凡得毫無特點的新姑夫一樣令人失望。</p>
<p>難遺這就是富年　轟烈烈的學生運動中的健將嗎；意外的惶惑使我侷促，使我不敢提到過去。</p>
<p>事後，我却又追悔自已組魯的直覺，我能以外表為　憑來斷定一個人的內心嗎？日子久了，也許能看見眞象的。可是媽有一天在聞談中提起：</p>
<p>「慧姑正和姑少爺關　扭，為了要他買一只錯戒。」</p>
<p>「鑽戒？」</p>
<p>於是我失去了重行試探的勇氣。</p>
<p>不久之後。却因偶然的機會在無錫碰見了她據說是姑夫要她來收一筆款于，舉止很　　，手指上閃耀營雪亮的　戒。</p>
<p>在她請我吃晚飯時，我故意慨嘆地逗她。</p>
<p>「日子過得眞快。在蘇州示威遊行的時代，還像在眼前呢？」</p>
<p>「還不是嗎？」她袛是勉強滲人一點惑慨似的：「學生時代眞象做了一場夢。」</p>
<p>一記得有一次　姑在　發基的學生大會上演說，我還照過一張相片呢？那時的慧姑　了不起！</p>
<p>「自己也不明白那時那來的　勁？」</p>
<p>「那張相片和你常時所寫的動人的文章·都還在老家的必出裹藏着呢？」我說了一個謊來窺視她的反應。</p>
<p>「是馬？」近乎漠然的：「幾年來吃吃穿穿，玩玩　看，也就忘了那些胡說　像　的錘子撞擊我的心坎，同一個人，站　時間的兩端，竟會表現出二種絕然相反的姿能與懷抱，質使人感到歲目的無情錫回來來，心底把當年慧姑的雄姿劃上條羅槓。</p>
<p>轉瞬却是新年來了。</p>
<p>初三日，爸爸跟我說：「到姑夫家去拜個年，今天又是你慧姑的小生日</p>
<p>無奈·我又踏進了慧姑的家。</p>
<p>他們正在打牌，看　姑熟練的手法，我體會她已有了很豐富的經騐了，她邊打牌邊吩咐着娘姨為我倒茶，端菓盤，下　　，我却祗是呆呆地望着她的背影，我想，要是在當年慷慨激動昂地遊行時請她回家去打牌的話，那準會給我回一口唾沬，或者竟把我潛成瘋子。</p>
<p>正在暝想時，二個孩子嚷着上樓來了。</p>
<p>一媽媽帶我們去看習影。」</p>
<p>可是是聚精會神正在做一付　　番大牌的母親沒有與緻去對付孩子們，祇厭惡地馬上拿幾張鈔票塞一進孩子的手去。</p>
<p>「乖乖地二個人去玩撲克牌吧！」</p>
<p>孩子們却　起小嘴說一：一不要　」</p>
<p>那麼和娘姨去推牌</p>
<p>「也不要　」</p>
<p>母親正輪到伸子，想來一張自模」的好牌再加一番，對面的女太太　擬下牌來了。</p>
<p>一是三番！</p>
<p>這一氣，慧姑姑空手縮回來就給了孩子拍的幾一耳光。</p>
<p>「死小鬼　吵死了　一</p>
<p>孩子哇的哭起來了。</p>
<p>「娘姨！一她使性子的喊着：「帶他們弄堂裹買糖吃去　」</p>
<p>我呆望着再也坐不住</p>
<p>匆忙地站起來告辭，也沒有去聽主人在說什麽留客的話了。</p>
<p>出了大門口，我才深深地呼了一口氣。我聖才</p>

<h3>囤藥記</h3>
<p>— 管仁發</p>
<p>張先生笑嘻嘻捧了一大匣東西，跨進亭子問門。張太太迎上來說：「夢一志——張先生的名字，今天買了些什麼回來？」設時雖手將東西接過，放在統裝　上。</p>
<p>「你猜猜看？」一面脫下輸子，一所說。</p>
<p>「我知道，道是　　　補針。」張太太自幼也曾唸過幾年書，對於普通的字，卻也誰得。所以她看了匣邊所印的品名，就能很容易地讀出來。</p>
<p>張先生笑了起來：「你長……我相信，你一定要問，為什麼無綠無故去買這補針？」張先生接下去說：今天早晨到寫字間去的時候，在路上過見一位同學，他現在在　　藥　做技師。他間我說：「你最近除了一天到晚辦公外，可還做別的麽？」我回說沒有，他又說：「你可要做一些買賣嗎？這幾天西藥價很穩平，實進幾瓶補針不上半個月，就可以　綫。要不要買一些試試看？」我沒有回答，他又接下去說：近來　　　補針缺貨，我看置了進來，包可對本對利。一我說現款不便，他說沒關係所以我買了進夾，款子等貨物脫手後還他。」</p>
<p>這幾天張先生忙得不得了，東奔西走。為的是想將所囤的五打捕針出能，但是，這樣辛苦使身體衰弱了不少，他夫人關心地稅。學志，你整天東奔西走，太吃力了，這針藥放在家裏又不討飯吃，何必一定要立刻出籠？」</p>
<p>你要知道，這針　的錢還沒有　淸呢？」張先生用悲愁的口吻說，臉上　出奧喪的神氣</p>
<p>張太太聰了愕然。</p>
<p>張先生實在太辛苦了。終於病倒了。經醫生的診斷，並沒有什麽大病，又須稍稍靜　　靜養，就可痊愈，如果再能打幾針補針，那就可以好得更快</p>
<p>張太太聽　補針　　字，立刻走過去，開了樹門，取出張先生為了它而病倒的　　　補針，問醫生說：」補針可用得麼？」醫生點了點說：「如果張先生要注射的話，得要每天到我醫院來就</p>
<p>日，張先開始主動他自己囤的　　　補　了。</p>
<p>生命的真諦　華生</p>
<p>記得羅曼蘭說：」生命的真諦是政府生命」；人人都有生命，可是不一定任人都有真正的生命，真正的生命袛有從　運的　答宰割下完成的，是從跟生活的掙扎門爭中求取的。您們有了生命，更須有與正的生命，您們以爲　滿的生活，沒有生命的生活便算是人生嗎？朋友們！要知道人生是再沒有比真正的生命更值得留　的了。</p>
<h3>題紀念册</h3>
<p>— 諸葛心</p>
<p>教我寫些甚麼語句在你們的簿子上呢？你們的鄉裹每一頁都　我　說的話。如果又重覆地寫上去，這未免太增塲了你們的薄了。如果要寫此外自已所要說的話呢。自已所要稅的又太多了，我恐怕滿　也不能把自己要說的寫完。</p>
<p>……所以很好海是它空白蕩！——如果要紀念會有過一個這樣的友人，或者是兄弟——我想：假如我是值得為你們所紀念着的，便是不留半點墨跡也可畏存於你們的記憶中。</p>
<p>宇宙之於人，就如滄海間的一點小浮萍，沒有浪花　　不出平靜。沒有離別就不能事有　人會的歡欣。沒有悲哀也就沒有極反“樂的感覺，我們應深明白它，　　　川它。</p>
<p>人的可貴　　在能有思想，能自己走自己要走的路。沒有正確的思想，就沒有正確的行動。人的生存就在能白　　「　食　，能「消化」食糧。這不論在物質上或精神上欠缺這稱木領，就不能算一個眞完全的人。</p>
<p>我們應　幸，爲我們自己能生於這一個動蕩的世紀。一切在麼鬼的腸與而毀減的，焦損的都必要由生在這年代的靑年來重新創造。</p>
<p>我們固不應符大自己幻想得自己如「神」，更不應把自己看得無用如行屍走肉。面對一　現實應護力去武裝起自己的平與　，法」有一分然發一分光」。</p>

<h3>第二屆公開籃球賽即將舉行　貢獻當局幾個意見</h3>
<p>上海籃球聯合會與中寗體育部聯合　　之第二公開　球，業於本月十七日截止報名。參加角逐之中西男女勁旅共計六十一之多，羣英會萃，漪歟盛哉，日後盛况，自在意中　惟我人　於本　西靑　　殊多，如球員毆打裁判，觀衆時有吵鬧事件，秩序之紊亂，不一而足晨友盃亦發生提抗議事件，當局辦事之不遲，實亦不能　其　。　　之漸，固非一朝一夕，而作者乘此未展幕前·敬獻一得之見·傳他山之石，成可攻錯也。</p>
<p>秩序</p>
<p>對於比賽之編排，務求均勻，不緊張與精彩之球賽，應予相當調劑·否則過於擁擠之日，就不免秩序方面，難以維持。至票子問題，尤應大公無私，不賣交情。記者及球員一席，不能如過去之有名無實，引起種種惡惑。更必須增添幹事，計分員計時員應有訓諫。（幹事須備臂章）票子張數，不能隊意膨脹，應有限制，庶幾球塲必可有良好之秩序。</p>
<p>票價</p>
<p>此點在可能範團內應。求儘量低廉、以求普及，鄙意似可全部售二十元或分十五·三十元兩種（惟必須界限分明，不能一混亂。）</p>
<p>燈光</p>
<p>在節約電流聲中，當不能過於苛求，但如無相當光綫，球員表演，必受影響，希望常局能在別方面設法，而略增加球賽時之支光，（目前百支光，殊覺太少，應增加四十支光。）</p>
<p>裁判</p>
<p>西靑籃球塞中關於裁一判缺點殊冬，木刋曾加以指出，並貢獻裁判應注意之點，可資參考。總之應多聘優良之裁判，切忌如西靑之包辦制。</p>
<p>召球開球隊會議</p>
<p>每週可召集各球隊代表，（不必費分文）開座談會，報告歷次比賽經過，及應改進之處。俾加強聯賽之進行，亦所以聯絡球隊中之慼情。</p>
<p>嚴　犯規球員</p>
<p>此點足球會行，如有重大犯規之球員，予以停賽處罰，或停止幾星期出場權。惟籃球聯賽中，未見會能有是項規定，俾委員會能有是項規定，俾使球員有所頭忌，不道德之野蠻舉動，可以在無形中減少。</p>
<p>注意普及提倡</p>
<p>歷來比賽側重甲組，對於乙組，則甚忽視，殊失倡導之木旨，尤其對於女子組，應特加提倡，事實上，女子體育日形落後。觀乎木屆女子組有五隊之數，在此時期中，實屬難能可貴，據悉當局對於女子組取單衛環制，鄙意不如改為雙循環制。藍如採單循環，祗有十塲比賽，切磋之機會殊少，為符合提倡初衷，實應使其多作比賽。”採雙循環制，在大局上，亦有利而無困難。</p>
<p>裝置擴大話機</p>
<p>裝置擴大談機</p>
<p>觀衆對於規則方面，難免有不熟悉之處。故應置一擴大機，歷一熟悉規則之報告員，在必要時加以解釋，則無謂之誤會便可消減。而在休息及未開賽時，量好能傳播高尚音樂關球塲空氣。</p>
<p>處置散場出路</p>
<p>中靑散場後僅有一用道可走，勢必　擴不堪，易滋事件，應另關出路門戶。（事實上可能辦到）如是，則散塲後情形，可大見改善。</p>
<p>公開各項帳目</p>
<p>各項帳目，必須公開，毋令外界猜疑，以昭大信，而發揚體育之眞精神也。</p>
<p>總上十點，爲當局極易改良者。用特　述，以供採　幸　以爲紙上空談而河　我言，　爲萬幸。</p>
<h3>球雜聞</h3>
<p>— 瘦人</p>
<p>公開籃球賽報名加入甲組，而被當局降入乙組者甚多。其中如東華有賈幼良韓龍海，明星有陳學崇史久全沈達，友隊有陶紹生鄒自仁何孝光樊慶成等名將。一方面減少乙組興趣，一方面亦使上述各隊之不滿，不識常局可重行考慮乎？</p>
<p>包松圓加入華影，包在吳文超導演之霍元甲影片中有鏡頭，月開包極有意思做大明星。</p>
<p>中北隊復活，已加入公開籃球聯賽。北派作風，又可鬨動球迷。</p>

<h3>評上足球賽　東鏵戰士奪勇一驚愈好</h3>
<p>滬聯會足球甲組聯賽，已人第二循環。短兵相接之際，按第一循環中東華保持全勝，領導羣英，高居首席。聯誼僅負一次，追隨於後，一警葡商僑聯亦整飭軍容，雄心未死。猶太三省則難免落後矣。上週中華隊兩巨頭均有戰事，又唱凱歌，強弱難逃公例，茲評上週及希望於木週之　事。</p>
<p>聯誼守優於攻猶太潰不成軍</p>
<p>聯誼一七對二大勝猶太，然演出實末臻理想。司開劉　漠因公缺席，改由籃球好手慮谷　營試。結果大失所望，可見萬事决不如想像之簡單。精於籃球者，豈必能勝任足球守門。小盧念應退讓，專心籃球。是戰聯誼之中衛綫甚佳，其所以勝，即觀於此。夫足球術中，中衛綫必須前助攻退以守。呼前　後，始有成就、聯誼中堅宋靈聖此中老手，是日蔡農淼亦殊賣力，前鋒乃得極多之接濟有狂盛之攻勞，焉有不勝之理。唯前鋒表演並不佳妙，許文牽怪作雖多，唯未盡中鋒傳遞之　。高保正勇則勇矣，總嫌地位不佳。　永耀不慣前鋒，當未可以原非·而翼均失望。費春之點殊多，應用速度聲着之點殊多，應用速度盤旋，切忌多弄花巧。俞振岳之左翼，失其所在，按翼位得球必須沿邊綫疚、至適當地位勾中，造成攻門機會，而小俞得球，輒向中路盤進，冀自得功，大不足取，尚　小俞力圖改進。猶太軍心渙散，凋零之陣容，毋怪其一敗塗地矣。再不刷新兵將黑馬」之譽，將無以復存矣。</p>
<p>東華韓龍海有　　進步　　東華勝葡商之役，全賴乎韓龍海之　進，有突出之進展。葡商所受之威　，均為韓一人所施與。唯葡商下半時中，兩後衛立在韓之前，引其越位，竟入其設中。越位次數，不下十次以上，否則多獲數球，極為可能。夫東華避免越位辦法，後房友供給　　進之機會，見對方　　　　時，不應從重路挑球，必　過於前，則翼可連　，球已進前，是則小　　可利用其快　之竅，而對方兩衛，欲返身追上，勞不能及，越位之錯旣可遭免，而直搗黃龍，易　反掌。不識東董當局，亦以余言為然耶？東華煎鋒在戰麟經缺席下，通絡關少。故老將自有其經隊資格為非新進所能及。東華守一衛方面，更趨佳境，莊友仁　樹棠恢復雄風·張邦綸之門將，穩建勝當。總之東華聲勢旣盛，戰士興奮，乃有意想不到之收獲。備商似不注重於聯　。事實上聯賽中，决無希望。故老將如馬山兒考司坦奧列雜拉等均退隱，戰來究屬錯誤時見，不免低首見屆·</p>
<p>一驚利用長力打破　風小將</p>
<p>三省不敵一驚，原屬意料中事，然决想不到有二對八之比數。猶憶第一循環，三省僅以二對三小敗，誰料上週之一蹶不振。理由為一警力足，乃利用長傳，三省人小力不逮，遂為所乘。一警近來愈踢愈好，且能利用其動力之充足，作遙傳急進包抄突破等策略。日後，東華聯誼遇之，應用戰術，始克成功，實爲心腹之患</p>
<p>至本　有足球三場東華必勝華通，聯誼穩取三省。然作者極盼東華聯誼能在取勝之戰勝中，有卓然之表演，勿徒以取勝而已。使敗者折服之外，亦能得到球　上之惠義豈能大佳。葡商，僑聯兩軍相逢，必為劇鬥，僑聯久未露險，而練習甚殷，必有佳搆，而恢復義海軍時代之威名。球迷勿以西隊相戰，無足一觀，為欲賞其球藝必可滿意而返。（梅潔）</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – This Nanjing Municipal Local Administrative Conference lasted for two days and achieved extremely satisfactory results. A total of 76 proposals were received, among which the most important were the proposals for strengthening Baojia, strengthening material control, increasing production, and strengthening youth training. Regarding the Baojia section, there were proposals for rectifying household registration and ensuring local security. In order to promote a unified approach between the municipal government, district offices, and district police stations for household surveys, it was decided to establish a unified method planned by the two agencies to facilitate communication and facilitate material allocation. Regarding the proposals for material control, most were extremely detailed on issues such as smoothing sources, balancing prices, and improving allocation methods, and were all submitted to the conference for resolution. Regarding the issue of material allocation, it is expected that the allocation of materials in the city will become more standardized in the future. Increasing production is one of the important tasks in the municipal government's governance this year, so there were many proposals, including establishing industries, reclaiming wasteland, raising fish and livestock, and planting cotton and afforestation. However, the production increase projects still need to be guided and managed by experts. In addition to detailed discussions by the conference and reference by the Municipal Grain Bureau, the above proposals were also referred to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food for joint planning and management. In addition to strengthening youth training, the issue of improving the lives of school teachers was also given great attention.

<h3>Editorial: Where Lies the Crux?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Mainland News (translation found in today's Japanese edition) carried a report stating: On February 19th, Yu Jiang, in his broadcast address to the people under his rule at the 10th anniversary celebration of the New Life Movement he initiated, directly admitted that the New Life Movement had achieved considerable success before the "War of Resistance." After the "War of Resistance," due to the difficulties of wartime, social morality was adversely affected. After 1940, prices soared, exceeding pre-war levels by a hundredfold. Therefore, the decline of national morality is inversely proportional to the rise in prices; that is, if prices rise twofold, national morality declines twofold. Now, because prices have risen a hundredfold, national morality may have declined a hundredfold as well. This is a great disgrace to the nation. If it continues to decline, the success of "War of Resistance and National Reconstruction" will be hopeless.</p>
<p>In fact, since the start of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, since Japan began to change its new policy towards China in the spring of last year, and since the Greater East Asia Conference announced its five principles in November of last year, the coexistence and co-prosperity of the Greater East Asian countries, the situation of Asia for Asians, has become very clear. Therefore, the theoretical basis for Chongqing's stubborn refusal to acknowledge this and continuing the war effort has long ceased to exist. A war effort that has already lost its theoretical basis is, of course, a blind and dangerous action. From this perspective, Yu Jiang's pointing out that the decline of morality among the people of Chongqing is inversely proportional to the rise in prices is an inevitable result of the situation.</p>
<p>However, what exactly is the crux of the matter that has caused the decline of national morality and the rise in prices in Chongqing to be inversely proportional? Whose responsibility is it? We can say that the main crux lies in the poor political situation in Chongqing. It is because the political situation has become dark and corrupt that it has driven the decline of national morality; it is because the political situation has become dark and corrupt that it has promoted the rise in prices. The responsibility for creating a poor political situation should, of course, be borne by the leaders in Chongqing. Yu Jiang does not reflect on improving politics to solve the problem of the decline of national morality and the rise in prices caused by the poor political situation, but instead blames the people, which is just useless nonsense.</p>
<p>However, we, the people in the peaceful areas, believe that the reasons for the soaring prices in Chongqing, in addition to the poor political situation, also include the blockade of surrounding materials, as well as the barren land and lack of resources. The rise in prices in the peaceful areas is even greater than in Chongqing. The peaceful areas are prosperous, with abundant resources, and transportation is not interrupted. According to common sense, the rise in prices should not compete with Chongqing. What is the crux of the matter here? It is already obvious without explanation. Yu Jiang knows that "our success" is hopeless in the face of this phenomenon. How can the peaceful areas, with this phenomenon, bear the responsibility of being the rear base for the Greater Asia War and fulfill the obligation to participate in the war?</p>
<p>Here, we do not hesitate to reiterate our consistent claim, which is that the government absolutely needs to establish a good government and quickly reform politics to eliminate the abnormal phenomena caused by poor politics in the past. At the same time, we always believe that the economic crisis cannot be saved by economic forces alone, and it will not be successful unless political reform is the prerequisite. This is worth repeating for the common attention of the government and the public.</p>
<h3>Anxieties About the People's War-Weariness: Fully Reflected in Yu Jiang's Broadcast Address; Quotations from the Mainland News</h3>
<p>The 19th of this month was the 10th anniversary of the New Life Movement of the Chongqing regime. Chiang Kai-shek gave a broadcast speech, ostensibly "addressing the compatriots of the whole country." In his broadcast, he first said: "Looking back on the achievements of the past ten years, I am truly ashamed." Since 1937, we have encountered the difficulties of war, and social morality has declined. In the past three years, prices have soared to more than a hundred times pre-war levels. At the same time, national morality has declined proportionally. He cast sorrowful words on the chaotic state of wartime society, attempting to stir up the dejected thoughts to become passionate again, and specifically demanded that the people contribute material resources and labor, asking the people who are already struggling for breath for even greater sacrifices. The main point of the speech is the decline of wartime ideology and the financial bankruptcy of the war that have gradually formed over the seven years of the war. He expressed very painful depression about the trend of the people's thoughts. "If this continues, the war will collapse." He expressed great grief and indignation towards the people who are gradually realizing and deviating from the people because of the surrounding situation in East Asia, and loudly called out to drive them back into the war. Chiang Kai-shek has never boldly and frankly stated the current situation of the wartime society and demanded the people's awakening. From this, we can see the depression of the leadership below Chiang Kai-shek. From Chiang Kai-shek's speech directly stating to the people that the dragging war is coming to an end, we can see the current trends and future direction under the rule of Chongqing.</p>
<p>Main Points of Chiang's Broadcast Address</p>
<p>Today, on the 10th anniversary of the New Life Movement, looking at the present and comparing it with the past, I am truly ashamed. The enthusiasm in some places has gradually faded, some places have not yet implemented it, and the general society is still full of disorder and dirt. This is true for individuals, and even more so for families. The talk of improving life is not heard, this is true for big cities, and the countryside is not hard to imagine. In this way, what do we use to talk about equality with other nations, how can we survive in the current world? I have promoted the New Life Movement for ten years, and I still cannot eliminate these obstacles today, I am truly ashamed. However, since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 1937, due to the difficulties of wartime, social morality has been adversely affected. By 1940, prices have soared to more than a hundred times pre-war levels. Here, national morality is gradually declining, which is inversely proportional to the rise in prices. That is, if prices rise twofold, national morality declines twofold. Now, because prices have risen about a hundredfold, national morality may have declined a hundredfold as well. This is a great disgrace to the nation and a stain on the history of the war. I tell you, if we continue to decline, our success will be hopeless. To strengthen our strength, stabilize prices, and return to the old state, we can start with the following three aspects: The government thoroughly controls prices. Socially influential people endure hardship and work hard, and supervise and guide each other based on the spirit of self-love and self-respect. All the people, based on patriotism, overcome the concept of selfishness and desire, and automatically cooperate with the government's price policy.</p>
<p>In addition to the above reforms in both material and spiritual aspects, there is another point that should be awakened, that is, the most important meaning of the New Life Movement is to enable the people to fulfill their obligations in wartime. Now, I put forward two hopes for you to implement:</p>
<p>Diligence and Thrift: The main tasks of this year are to increase production and conserve consumption. This is the most basic task that the people should fulfill. If the increase in production is used for personal enjoyment, it will only become an increase in consumption and waste of materials. If the savings are put into one's own pocket, it will only create idle funds and destroy the social economy. Therefore, the proceeds from increasing production and saving consumption should be automatically donated to the country for official duties. Regarding the thorough implementation of thrift and savings, it is hoped that each household will save 100 yuan of national currency per month, or more than 30% of the total income.</p>
<p>Implementation of Compulsory Labor: The Compulsory Labor Law was promulgated in December last year. China has no capital, but it has a lot of manpower, which is our main capital. The compulsory labor for the people in each place is ten days per year. We have no funds to give to various places, but if we use labor to generate capital, and use labor to accumulate capital, we can improve the local economy, strengthen the effectiveness of local autonomy, and cultivate a strong national strength. (Xiang: Translated from the Mainland News, February 24)</p>
<h3>Arakan Front Operations Enter a New Phase; Indian National Army Achieves Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front, the Supreme Command of the Indian National Army announced on the 21st the brilliant achievements of the INA on the Arakan front. Among them, the achievements of the INA's vanguard unit were the greatest. Near Nakiang, this unit joined forces with the Japanese army to break into the enemy positions. After a fierce battle, it was responsible for cutting off the retreat route of the defeated British 7th Division. It braved attacks from enemy fighters, broke out of the enemy's large army, and destroyed the only bridge in that area, leaving the defeated British 7th Army with no way to escape, completely entering the encirclement. It is now advancing towards the Polibazar area. Another unit of the INA crossed the Mayu River and annihilated several Indian soldiers and officers of the enemy 7th Division. It then advanced from Tungubazar towards the enemy's rear areas. At that time, many Indian soldiers continued to surrender, also achieving great results. Due to this operation by the unit, the Indian campaign has entered a new phase, and is therefore worthy of attention. The enemy's Southeast Asia Command and the O'Brien's defense forces have been greatly shaken. Therefore, in order to prevent the INA from being active, they dispatched African native troops to a location approximately 10 kilometers away to launch a defensive battle. However, it is impossible for the mere native troops to change the war situation. At the meeting of the Indian Central Assembly on the 16th, Indian Defense Force Commander O'Brien announced the war situation, saying: The claim that the 7th Army is on the verge of collapse is a false propaganda by the enemy. The intention of the Japanese army is to weaken our military power on the Burmese-Indian front and collapse the important bases. They have no intention of entering India. This is nothing more than a tactic to cover up this major defeat. He did not mention the activities of the INA at all, which proves that the enemy is afraid that the activities of the INA will affect the wavering of the Indian military and civilians.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from the Burmese front reports that a unit of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese army on the Indian-Burmese front, fought bravely and occupied a certain high ground east of Buthidaung. At the same time, the units commanded by Indian officers who were expecting the INA to attack the British-Indian army were split, causing great disturbance in the enemy camp. Furthermore, the INA, which had penetrated deep into the enemy's side and cooperated with the Japanese army to cut off the enemy's road between Segabin and Nagazunku, is attacking the enemy headquarters. At the same time, a powerful unit of the INA has also begun to operate. Therefore, the pressure felt by the British side is becoming increasingly severe, so the British-Indian authorities are doubly embarrassed and are now doing their best to employ their tactics of appeasement and suppression.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in Various Parts of North China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army in North China has recently achieved great results in sweeping away the communist bandits in various places. The Japanese army in central Hebei received a report on the 18th that the Zhangbeizhuang Security Team was fighting with 150 communist bandits. They rushed to the scene and cooperated in attacking the communist bandits northwest of Gaozhuang, killing most of them. In this battle, the communist bandits left behind 68 bodies, and the Japanese army captured one Czech machine gun, 26 rifles, and many other military supplies. On the same day, another team of Japanese troops defeated the communist guerrillas 15 kilometers southwest of Mengjiazhuang Anping. The communist bandits left behind 37 bodies, and 20 people were captured. On the 20th, the Japanese army launched a night raid on Huobintai Lengquan, annihilating a part of the 36th Regiment of the Communist Army. The communist soldiers left behind 37 bodies, and 10 people were captured. The Japanese army seized 16 rifles, 246 bullets, and 38 hand grenades. Furthermore, at dawn on the 15th, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Nanwangzhuang Kujing (14 kilometers south of Tangshan) and engaged in a battle with more than 20 members of the puppet county government security team. After an hour or so of fierce fighting, they were defeated. In this battle, the communist soldiers left behind 15 bodies, and 2 people were captured. The Japanese army seized 8 rifles, 450 bullets, and 35 hand grenades.</p>
<h3>Report by Finnish Foreign Minister on the Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Helsinki, 24th (Central News Agency) – Haisong News: Finnish Foreign Minister Somsi reported on the diplomatic and political situation yesterday at a meeting of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<h3>Stalin Demands a Second Front</h3>
<p>Moscow, 24th (Central News Agency) – Marshal Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, issued his usual proclamation to all officers and soldiers on the 23rd, the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, pointing out that the Soviet Army still needs a second front in its operations, and demanding that Britain and the United States open it as soon as possible. History teaches us that Germany often wins when fighting on the front line, but often fails when fighting on two fronts. In this war, Germany is fighting on one front, so if the anti-Axis forces start a new front, and the anti-Axis forces comprehensively strengthen the pressure on the German army, then Germany will encounter major events. All Soviet officers and soldiers must not be complacent because of past successes, and should correctly assess Germany's strength. History tells us that the enemy will never go into the abyss of destruction on their own, so in order to win, we must force the enemy into the path of danger. Therefore, I order the entire army: 1. All Soviet officers and soldiers should train their military skills and strictly abide by military discipline. 2. Soviet officers should study command skills and inspire the intelligence of their subordinates.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Raise Several Demands to Spain</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to London news, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on Wednesday that Britain and the United States have raised several demands to Spain, but their content does not harm Spain's sovereignty. Negotiations are still ongoing in Madrid. Eden added that no one can force us to give up our limited gasoline unless we do so voluntarily.</p>
<p>Geneva, 24th (Central News Agency) – The British left-wing radical newspaper Tribune published that the anti-Axis countries demand international co-administration of Tangier in Spanish North Africa, a full amnesty for political prisoners, accommodation of the Spanish people who support the reconstruction of the republic, the abolition of newspaper censorship in Spain, and the establishment of a date for free and universal elections. General Franco may not accept these conditions. The newspaper stated: If the British people welcome another Spanish government, then we have powerful weapons, namely radio broadcasts and pamphlets. British Ambassador to Spain Hoare has never used these methods, but the time for action has arrived today. The British labor movement will take the lead in a final settlement with Spain, and a time of reckoning for "Franco," who currently rules Spain, Argentina, Hungary, and Finland.</p>
<h3>Churchill Believes the War Will Last Until Next Year</h3>
<p>Geneva, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, DC, people in the Washington military and naval circles commented that Churchill's speech in the House of Commons, believing that the war may extend to 1945, pointed out that Germany is still producing a large number of weapons, and the European war is far behind the anti-Axis plan.</p>
<h3>Bose Gives a Speech Commemorating Mrs. Gandhi</h3>
<p>Phnom Penh, 24th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base in Burma: Mrs. Gandhi died in prison due to British abuse. The 3 million Indians living in East Asia are all extremely grief-stricken and indignant. Jiang Tela Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, also issued a speech on the 23rd commemorating Mrs. Gandhi, declaring his determination to expel the British from his motherland India and fight to the end.

<h3>Eastern Front Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Military correspondent Plato of the Huitong News Agency reports: The German army is counter-attacking in the triangle area of ​​Teske, Rovno, and Dubno on the Eastern Front. It has now advanced to the ancient city of Lutsk. The Soviet cavalry in this area is in a very precarious situation due to the extension of its supply lines and repeated attacks by the German army. As a result of the German advance, the resistance of the enemy forces has been overcome, and they are now engaged in the annihilation of the remaining enemy forces through intensified training. The German forces on the northern and southern routes are still continuing to adjust their battle lines and straighten them. After the German forces withdrew from Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army, with its new elite, attempted to advance south towards the mouth of the Boh River. The attacks by enemy forces on other routes are only of a local nature, aimed at disrupting the German army's actions. The slackening of the Soviet army's offensive clearly indicates the preparation for a large-scale offensive, as our army has detected frequent movements of the enemy in the rear, especially in the central route. The war on the northern route is calm, with snow accumulating to a depth of 30 to 40 centimeters.</p>
<h3>International Briefs</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the German News Agency, citing London broadcast reports, Roosevelt sent a telegram to Stalin yesterday to congratulate the Red Army's anniversary, in order to improve the cooperative relationship that has gradually disappeared since the Moscow and Tehran coordinations.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Opposes New Taxes, Causing Chaos in Washington - Public Thinks It is a Political Battle Against Congress -</h3>
<p>Geneva, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to New York dispatches: President Roosevelt's opposition to the new tax bill has caused extreme chaos in Washington and may also have a considerable impact on the presidential election. The public believes that Roosevelt is waging a political battle against Congress, and his attitude is unpredictable. The reasons he announced for rejecting the tax bill are unreasonable and border on arrogance. Democratic and Republican members of Congress are now planning to use a majority vote to counter Roosevelt's opposition. Members of the Budget Committee said that Roosevelt's message was a fierce attack on Congress. Qualified sources say that if Roosevelt's opposition is accepted, a special bill may be proposed. A prominent member of Congress attacked Roosevelt's opposition, saying that irresponsible theorists, such as advisors in the White House, are attempting to encroach on Congress's taxing power. The chairmen of the congressional committees, Doughton and Knutson, criticized the President's tax demand of $10,500,000,000, saying it would have a huge impact on individuals and industries. Congress's reduction of the tax revenue to $2,315,000,000 is based on the belief that the American people's ability to pay taxes is only up to this level. The House of Representatives will discuss this matter today.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth, Method of Rationing Has Been Sent to the Municipal Government for Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Cloth Guild previously submitted a report stating that the business of its member cloth shops had come to a standstill and their lives were becoming increasingly difficult. The guild requested that the scattered pieces of cloth sold be priced according to rationing prices and paid in cash at one time for relief. The Commerce and Trade Commission expressed sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the cloth merchants in this city due to the purchase of yarn and cloth. It was proposed to allow the guild to collect all scattered pieces of cloth from merchants for temporary rationing. The request was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now learned that the Commerce and Trade Commission has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating: "The submitted report has been noted. The request is tentatively approved. However, this case is of great importance to the unified control of yarn and cloth and should be handled carefully and rigorously assessed to avoid any abuses." The commission has instructed the Cotton Control Bureau to properly draft implementation measures, and after approval, it will notify the relevant parties to implement them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Rationing Method</h3>
<p>The general public is very concerned about the temporary rationing of cotton cloth in this city. A person in charge of the Commerce and Trade Commission told reporters yesterday that the key points of the temporary cotton cloth rationing are as follows: The rationing method has been determined by the commission and sent to the municipal government for approval. The method will be announced and implemented jointly after a certain period of time. The cloth coupon will be designed in a unified style by the commission and approved by the municipal government. It is proposed that the municipal government transfer the design to the Economic Section of the First District Office to imitate the rice coupon and print it on behalf of the commission. The cost will be borne by the commission. The report that the 54th issue of rice coupons would be used as a substitute yesterday was not true. The distribution of cloth coupons will be handled by an agency designated by the municipal government. The retailers to be designated will be sent by the commission to the municipal government for review. If there are no objections, they will be approved. The cloth shop guild has already compiled a list of store numbers and designated allocation levels and sent it to the commission. Vice Director Yang of the Materials Department is currently in contact with the municipal government to review and approve it. Once approved, the purchase coupons can be printed according to the listed numbers and levels. Once the purchase coupons are printed, they can be distributed, and people can purchase cloth with them. When retailers are allocated cloth, they should sell it based on the retained amount. For the amount that is insufficient, they can paste a page for every hundred purchase coupons collected and go to the agency designated by the commission to receive the cloth in cash. Cloth outside the reserved amount will be designated for rationing first in bulk. Each person can purchase one and a half lengths of cotton cloth with the coupon. The purchase coupon is valid for six months. When purchasing cloth with the coupon, customers can choose from the samples displayed by the retailers until the purchased amount is used up.</p>
<h3>Special Entertainment Consumption Tax to Be Implemented After Further Study, Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle special consumption taxes during the war. It drafted regulations on three types of special consumption taxes: retail goods, hotels and banquets, and entertainment. These regulations were submitted to the Ministry of Finance. On January 16 of this year, retail goods and hotel and banquet taxes were first levied in fifteen important counties and cities in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The entertainment consumption tax was originally intended to be implemented and levied at the same time, but due to various other issues that require further study, it was decided to postpone its implementation temporarily. There were previous reports that the entertainment consumption tax would be levied starting March 1, but according to sources from the Taxation Administration, the preparations for the tax levy have not been completed, so it will not be possible to levy the tax on March 1.</p>
<h3>German Embassy Information Department Hosts Banquet for the Press</h3>

The party ended on a joyful note around 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Supplementary Registration of Publications</h3>
<p>A reporter visited the Municipal Propaganda Department yesterday to inquire about the recent registration of periodicals in the city. The person in charge of the department said that nearly 220 newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals in the city had not applied to the Propaganda Department for registration during the concession era as required by law. After the takeover of the concessions, the department had already submitted a request to the municipal government, which ordered the First Police Bureau to transfer it to various parties to supplement their registration by the end of January and to cancel the registration documents issued by the previous concession authorities and the First Police Bureau. However, due to insufficient printing of the application forms, the process was slightly delayed. As of recently, more than 150 publications have not yet applied. With the approval of the municipal government, the deadline for supplementary registration has been extended to March 15. There will be absolutely no further extension. It is hoped that the newspapers and magazines concerned will expedite the process in accordance with the law and refrain from delaying further, lest they be subject to administrative penalties.</p>
<h3>Registration Number Must Be Clearly Indicated</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to Article 16 of the Publications Law, all publications that have already obtained registration certificates from the Propaganda Department must publish the registration certificate number in a prominent location on the publication. If the application is in progress and the registration certificate has not yet been issued by the Ministry, the phrase "Propaganda Department Registration Certificate Application in Progress" should also be indicated in a prominent location for identification. It is forbidden to publish the registration certificate number issued by the former concession authorities and the First Police Bureau.</p>

<h3>Lost Children Prevention Campaign to Be Held for One Week</h3>
<p>The Children's Welfare Section of the Industrial Survey Office of the First District Office will launch a "Lost Children Prevention Campaign" week, starting on February 25, to prevent the occurrence of lost children incidents. According to statistics from the section, among the 342 children sent home by the section in the past year, 140 were lost. Parents reported 326 cases of lost children in the past year. It is known that many children are lost, especially during the winter season, due to the occurrence of "child stripping" incidents. Child snatchers often lure children to remote places, strip their clothes, and run away. Children are thus lost and may even freeze to death or become child beggars, causing family separations. The section further reminds parents to pay attention to the following: Do not let children go out alone. Teach children to remember their names and addresses. Write the name and address on the child's underwear. If a child is lost, immediately report to the police station and the Children's Welfare Section of the First District Office. Pay attention to lost children reported in major newspapers.</p>

<h3>Various Trade Associations Prevent the Smuggling of Goods and Materials; Authorities Intensify Search Efforts</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent the smuggling of goods and materials out of the country and to avoid reducing existing reserves, have issued separate notices, stating in essence: "It has been found that although the existing reserves of goods and materials in this city are still quite sufficient, some members of the industry are selling entire batches of goods and materials at excessive prices to small retailers. Such behavior not only violates the association's regulations and the authorities' aim of stabilizing prices and curbing hoarding but also has a great impact on the future supply of goods and materials. All members of the industry are urged to abide by the regulations, selling goods and materials of any kind only to legitimate users and imposing appropriate restrictions to prevent hoarding. Should any violations of the regulations be discovered by the authorities, the association will not provide protection."</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to inquiries made by reporters from relevant sources, the authorities are being particularly strict with search efforts.

<h3>Increasingly Fierce Pacific Decisive Battle; Japanese Army Releases Explanation of War Situation by Major General Honma</h3>
<p>— Former Colonel</p>
<p>The enemy's Halsey Southwest Pacific Fleet harbored wild ambitions, attempting to break through the strategic point of Rabaul on New Britain Island in the South Pacific in one fell swoop. From the end of October to November of last year, they launched successive attacks in the sea near Bougainville Island, but after being skillfully and bravely intercepted and dealt a heavy blow by the Japanese naval forces, especially the air force, the enemy needed to quickly plan a new counteroffensive operation in order to cover up their defeat and break the deadlock in that area. The enemy's landing on Torokina has achieved its operational objectives. On the other hand, the heavy losses of warships are still covered up with a shameless means.</p>
<p>Nimitz's Counterattack</p>
<p>Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, declared on November 10, the 160th anniversary of the Navy, after the Second Bougainville Naval Air Battle: "The United States will launch a major offensive against the Japanese army in the near future and completely destroy its island fortresses." This also shows the enemy's impatience. Nimitz again declared on the 18th that a landing operation would be carried out in the Gilbert Islands, saying: "The Japanese army cannot fail to know that the U.S. military will soon launch a major offensive on the Central Pacific front." Since November 19, a large fleet, centered on aircraft carriers, launched a major attack on the waters around the Gilbert Islands. The enemy marine forces landed on Makin and Tarawa Islands on the 21st. The Japanese garrison forces on these two islands fought bravely. On the one hand, the Japanese submarines and naval air force, braving severe weather, fought with a small number against the masses, attacking the enemy's mobile force that came to attack and the enemy warships anchored on Makin Island until the 29th, especially their fierce attacks on the enemy aircraft carrier group. However, the enemy only announced the landing operations on Makin and Tarawa Islands in this regard, and still maintained a "secret non-disclosure" attitude regarding the losses of warships.</p>
<p>On February 5, the enemy was also approaching the Marshall Islands and the planes were coming to attack the Japanese base. Because the American troops' resupply to Makin and Tarawa were often threatened by the Japanese Southern Base’s air force, the enemy must first launch an attack to defeat the Japanese army in order to secure the two islands. However, this was countered by the Japanese air force, causing two of the central aircraft carriers of its mobile force to be lost. Nimitz's offensive against the Central Pacific has a close relationship with the offensive of Halsey’s fleet in the South Pacific, which is very obvious. However, Nimitz's offensive was not implemented because he could not overcome Rabaul in one fell swoop. This failure of the distraction operation should not be ignored. This offensive can be said to be the most important part of the enemy's self-proclaimed total Pacific counteroffensive, shoulder to shoulder with the South Pacific counteroffensive operation.</p>
<p>Ambition for Rabaul</p>
<p>The U.S. has suffered numerous defeats since the start of the war, but has recently begun to show signs of improvement. Their plan to counterattack the Japanese army can be divided into three items as follows: First, to regain the resource area of the Japanese in the South. The second disrupts production in order to directly attack the Japanese mainland. Third, the enemy wants to attack and destroy the Japanese maritime traffic line in order to hinder the connection between the Japanese resource area and the Japanese mainland production area, and the resupply of the front line. The first counterattack to regain the resource area began with the landing operation on Guadalcanal Island in August last year. Since then, the enemy has relied on the superiority of its base air power to launch a so-called "island hopping" operation in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The first reason the enemy began the counteroffensive operation was that the economic line between the United States and Australia was about to be cut off, so it had to be maintained at the last line. The major reason is the geographical conditions, because there are countless islands close to each other. Within about half a year since the start of the war, the enemy has lost most of the aircraft carriers it had before the war, and now it is relying on the numerical superiority of its air power to fight the war. Therefore, there is no other way than to ensure the base. Therefore, the main force of the operation is concentrated on the sea near the islands where a large base air power can be deployed. As a result, a large base air power was deployed in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and in the past year, under its control of the air, it slowly advanced towards Rabaul, the strategic point of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>During this time of more than a year, it was also the "time" to reorganize the aircraft carrier formation. During this period, the enemy worked hard to build aircraft carriers, and by the autumn, its reorganized aircraft carrier formation had also achieved its wish.</p>
<p>Then, the enemy planned a Central Pacific counteroffensive operation that was different from the South Pacific operation, and had to use the air power of aircraft carriers—a new offensive aimed at disrupting the production of the Japanese mainland. The large-scale bombing of Oshima Island and Minami Torishima Island by the enemy last autumn can be said to be a prelude to the war.</p>
<p>At the same time, the island hopping operation in the Solomon Islands has also approached its final target, Rabaul, and is about to enter the final stage.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the war in the Central Pacific, like the war in the South Pacific, is gradually maturing in terms of the timing of the new offensive. However, looking at the coordination of these two major counteroffensive operations with the current stage of the world war, its main goal can be inferred as follows: That is, in the South Pacific, the enemy wants to break through Rabaul in one fell swoop, and in the Central Pacific, it wants to obtain the Gilbert Islands as the first base to threaten the Japanese Inner South Seas and establish a strategic position capable of attacking the Japanese mainland. The enemy hoped to achieve these two major results before Christmas. On the one hand, it exaggerated the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front in Europe. And the great impact of the continued large-scale bombing of Germany on the war effort, and on the other hand, vigorously launched political strategems such as parliamentary talks. As the war entered its second year, the United States began to promote its third year of victory. This can be said to be Roosevelt's delusional dreams.</p>
<p>Failure of Aircraft Carrier Tactics</p>
<p>However, the enemy's navy in the Central Pacific had to taste the answer of the strength of the Japanese fortress in the Pacific. In the four naval air battles in the Gilbert Islands waters and the aerial battles near the Marshall Islands, the enemy's aircraft carrier losses and destruction reached 13 ships. If we add the 11 ships lost in the six times in the Bougainville Islands, the losses of the enemy's aircraft carrier formation are truly considerable, especially the loss of people is even greater.</p>
<p>However, since the end of October, in just over 40 days, the South Pacific has launched 7 naval air battles, and the Central Pacific has launched 5 air battles. These facts show that the war situation is becoming more and more serious, and there is no need to describe it further.</p>
<p>However, although the enemy has suffered heavy damage, it is still landing near the Gilbert Islands in the South Pacific. On the one hand, in the Central Pacific, it is consolidating its base on Makin and preparing for a new offensive. Later, the posture of attacking that area is very clear. The enemy may say that the heavy losses of warships are an inevitable sacrifice in order to obtain a base, and even make them confident in their production power.</p>
<p>Not only that, judging from the composition of the enemy aircraft carriers before the attack on the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands, there is still a considerable number. We cannot see the Japanese army's great victories and only camp on optimism.</p>
<p>In short, the four air battles in the Gilbert Islands and the air battle in the Marshall Islands confirmed that the Japanese fortresses in the Pacific are as strong as iron walls. No matter how many aircraft carriers the enemy has, and repeatedly launches counteroffensives, under the Japanese army's solid land force, it is only a waste of sacrifice. This can be asserted. The strategic deployment of the Japanese army in that area is undoubtedly strong. From the experience of the campaign in the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands, the Japanese air force has also exerted unparalleled power. Under the extremely difficult conditions of either dusk or night, the Japanese soldiers bravely and accurately completed the mission. Their skills are undoubtedly superb, but among the sunken aircraft carriers, in addition to those whose types can be clearly recognized, there are many other types of aircraft carriers. After experiencing numerous experiences since the start of the war, the enemy has vigorously changed the types of aircraft carriers. Such a large number of enemy defeats shows the excellence of Japanese torpedoes. This fact, although it does not attract much attention, can be said to be one of the important implications of the results achieved this time.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle on Makin Island</p>
<p>Finally, we must never forget the brave Japanese garrison forces who fought bravely on Makin and Tarawa Islands in the waters of the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. As announced by the Japanese headquarters, due to the interruption of communication in the two islands, the details of the subsequent battles are still unknown. However, according to foreign broadcasts, we can also get a glimpse of the tragic situation of the Japanese garrison forces in these two islands. The enemy announced that the losses were even greater than those on Guadalcanal Island, or said: The number of deaths and injuries is the largest since the establishment of the Marine Corps. They said these words, in fact, not only because the enemy suffered heavy damage, but also wanted to use these announcements to cover up the losses of warships, which has a political aspect. The Japanese garrison forces on these two isolated islands, without forests, but on flat solid reefs, responded to a large number of powerful enemy forces. Their heroic groups, with firm beliefs, can also be imagined.</p>
<p>We express our heartfelt respect for their heroic battle. At the same time, we should transport more aircraft to make the iron formations of the front-line soldiers in the Pacific achieve even greater victories. Therefore, the strengthening and replenishment of maritime transportation capacity is a prerequisite, which includes the production in the rear, from resupply to replenishment and occasional victories. If the occasional mission is completed effectively in twelve points, then Roosevelt's call for "the third year of victory" will belong to us. (Excerpt from the Asahi Weekly dated December 26)</p>
<h3>Round Table Discussion of Female Doctors</h3>
<p>The Chinese female students studying at the Women's Medical College conducted a round table discussion with Ms. Kawai, the dormitory supervisor. They revealed their patriotic sentiments and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Japanese Women Under Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Ni Jiarong (24 years old, from Guangdong): Japanese women under the decisive battle are indeed very active. Seeing the brisk service of female employees on streetcars and buses, one cannot help but feel infinite trust and respect. Recently, it is said that they have also joined the production line of manufacturing aircraft and wartime military supplies, but Chinese women are old-fashioned in their thinking, and they think that relying on men is a special feature of women, and they do not want to work at all. After we return to China, we plan to completely break the system of Chinese women relying on men. Is the life of Chinese women carefree under the decisive battle right? I believe this must not be the case.</p>
<p>Zhou Huachun (23 years old, from Fujian): Japanese students are very friendly. After we return to the dormitory, we need to prepare four hours of homework. They take care of us more intimately than our own sisters. When we ask them for advice on things we don't understand, they do not fail to teach us wholeheartedly. We can wholeheartedly believe in the Japanese.</p>
<p>Improving China Should Start From the Family</p>
<p>Wang Shu (21 years old, from Henan): The Japanese people like cleanliness! Chinese families are always unhealthy, like the lair of disease. I think we must first improve the family's lifestyle. Therefore, although it is good to serve in hospitals in cities or set up clinics in cities, I think we should organize mobile clinics like Japan, etc., and engage in rural health work. Strive to popularize hygiene ideas.</p>
<p>Train More Female Doctors</p>
<p>Xi (22 years old, from Jiangsu): Indeed, Chinese people's hygiene is very poor. Even if they are sick, they think that faith and talismans can cure the disease, and they don't often see a doctor. Especially women, they are not willing to let male doctors treat them. From this point of view, China certainly needs male doctors, but it is also necessary to train many female doctors. Japan also has hospitals, health centers, and clinics in poor villages, but in China, once you go to the countryside, there are almost no medical materials! Although some places also have American and British hospitals and clinics, the government authorities, like Japan, also need to consider this point.</p>
<p>Wang Yuzhen (19 years old, from Hebei): I have learned a lot about Japanese womanhood from Principal Yoshioka and Dormitory Supervisor Kawai. I believe that Japanese womanhood can also become Chinese womanhood, and Eastern Asian womanhood. Containing a strong maternal love in gentleness, sincerity to the husband, and ambition to engage in the professional front, these three beautiful qualities are all attributed to the four words "sincere patriotism".</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Yoshioka gave the following concluding remarks:</p>
<p>The hygiene aspect of medicine is of course important. But regarding Japanese womanhood, we are particularly committed to teaching. Creating women who are suitable for real society, I think is more important than formal things such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement. If our moral education is solid and can be of some benefit to the Sino-Japanese union, we will be very pleased. It is our heart to educate Chinese students well.

<h3>Map of Germany's Northern European Fortress</h3>
<p>It has been almost a year and a half since the United Kingdom and the United States issued the "Second Front" check. Until today, the United Kingdom and the United States have sat idly by and watched the Soviet Union fight hard, and they are unwilling to implement a real Western European Second Front. However, as a result of the recent Tehran meeting, the United Kingdom and the United States finally succumbed to the pressure from the Soviet Union. Regarding Western Europe, they also announced the appointment of General Commander Eisenhower as the leader of the anti-Axis invasion of Europe. Regardless of whether the United Kingdom and the United States are willing, the formation of the Western European Second Front is inevitable.</p>
<p>In response, Germany has made full preparations. From Norway in the north to the Bile Mountains in the south, 7,700 heavy guns and 3,000 flat-shooting guns are deployed over a winding 4,500 kilometers. Millions of mines are laid on the entire coastline, and more than a thousand fortress positions are built on important coasts. Behind them is a complex defensive formation that can urgently dispatch powerful mechanized troops at any time and anywhere.</p>
<p>According to enemy observations, these fortress positions are like multi-story buildings made of cement and steel, four to six miles long, and their defensive walls cannot be broken by modern artillery.</p>
<p>This large-scale "Atlantic Wall" averages forty kilometers inland. In the middle, there are countless small airfields for fighter jets, and further inland there are large airfields for heavy bombers and dive bombers.</p>
<p>The fortress area is divided into many small areas, each with parachute landing and special alert units. In addition to the garrison, observation, artillery, air base guard, coastal machine gun, signal soldier, telegraph, and mechanized scout units within the fortress, the forward outposts are also equipped with tank units and assault units. However, the main force of the defense army is in the farther rear, where hundreds of tanks are waiting, ready to reward those who break through this defense with a barrage of artillery fire.</p>
<p>The country published here is an imaginary map of a part of the approximately 96-kilometer "Atlantic Fortress" between Dieppe and Boulogne in northern France. German submarines, torpedo boats, and anti-aircraft gunboats are cruising on the sea in front, and the coast is densely covered with mines. Further in, there is a defensive wall of barbed wire, observation towers, and train guns. Deep inland, there are criss-crossing tank trenches, as well as giant gun and anti-aircraft gun positions, and a second attack train gun position. Next is the advanced air force base, and behind it is the gathering place for large tanks and infantry, and further back is the large air force base. The iron bucket-like equipment is clear at a glance. The English Channel, which is only thirty-two kilometers wide, is now in a state of strict confrontation.

<h3>Aunt Hui</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lin</p>
<p>It's been more than seven years since I last saw Aunt Hui.</p>
<p>Her vivid and heroic bearing often flashes in my mind, like a Fu Qi hero standing before me.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, it was a time of great upheaval. Aunt Hui, known for her writing and eloquence, was elected chairman of the Suzhou Student Union Federation, leading the city's student movement with an unyielding spirit during that period of "patriotic student unrest."</p>
<p>The turmoil of the times stirred the young souls. As a sixth-grade student, I was inspired and influenced by Aunt Hui, which led me to participate in the great student ranks. I can still vividly recall the deafening applause that erupted in response to her impassioned speeches in front of the crowds, the echoes still resonating in my ears.</p>
<p>In my youth, Aunt Hui gave me too much influence. Like her sharp pen, her biting eloquence boldly and fiercely attacked the unreasonable old era. She brightened my eyes, enriched my mind, and filled my life. Even when I entered middle school, she tirelessly provided me with much help and encouragement, enabling me to gain considerable enlightenment in ideological understanding and writing skills.</p>
<p>The war separated us.</p>
<p>The isolation of news did not erase my impression of her. According to rumors, some said she got married, but the rumors only added more longing. Not only because she was my aunt, but also because she was the hero I admired.</p>
<p>In the autumn, I embraced the joyous news of "Aunt Hui and her new uncle-in-law are back" with extreme anticipation. According to my third uncle, they rented a fairly luxurious house on Nanyang Road, and the uncle-in-law is very capable, and the two boys are very cute.</p>
<p>That night, I indulged in too much fantasy, hoping to hear many gratifying and astonishing great experiences from Aunt Hui, and also speculating what kind of handsome figure the new uncle-in-law should be.</p>
<p>However, the first impression upon seeing her again made me almost disbelieve my own eyes. The Aunt Hui standing in front of me was just a woman wrapped in gorgeous clothes, with the plump figure characteristic of ordinary young mistresses. From her face full of makeup, I couldn't find a trace of her former spirit. Just like her new uncle-in-law, who was very mundane and unremarkable, she was just disappointingly ordinary.</p>
<p>Could this be the champion of the vigorous student movement of that year? The unexpected bewilderment made me feel awkward and afraid to mention the past.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I regretted my rough intuition again. Could I judge a person's inner self based on appearance? Maybe I could see the truth after a long time. But one day my mother mentioned in conversation:</p>
<p>"Aunt Hui is arguing with her young master to buy her a diamond ring."</p>
<p>"A diamond ring?"</p>
<p>So I lost the courage to try again.</p>
<p>Not long after, I ran into her in Wuxi by chance. It was said that her uncle-in-law asked her to collect a payment. Her demeanor was very lavish, and a dazzling diamond ring sparkled on her finger.</p>
<p>When she invited me to dinner, I deliberately teased her with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Time flies so fast. The era of demonstrating in Suzhou seems like yesterday, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" She only mixed a bit of emotion: "Student days were like a dream."</p>
<p>I remember once I took a photo of Aunt Hui giving a speech at a rally of enthusiastic students! Aunt Hui was amazing back then!</p>
<p>"I don't even understand where that energy came from back then?"</p>
<p>"That photo and the moving articles you used to write are still hidden in the cabinet at our old home, aren't they?" I told a lie to spy on her reaction.</p>
<p>"Is that so?" Almost indifferently: "For the past few years, I've been eating, dressing, playing, and watching dramas, so I've forgotten about those nonsensical things."</p>
<p>Like a hammer hitting my heart, the same person, standing on two ends of time, could show two completely opposite postures and feelings, which made people feel the ruthlessness of the years.</p>
<p>Back from Wuxi, I drew a dividing line across Aunt Hui's heroic figure of that year in my heart.</p>
<p>In an instant, the New Year came.</p>
<p>On the third day of the Lunar New Year, my dad said to me, "Go to your aunt and uncle's house to pay a New Year's visit. Today is also Aunt Hui's little birthday."</p>
<p>Helplessly, I stepped into Aunt Hui's house again.</p>
<p>They were playing mahjong. Seeing Aunt Hui's skillful techniques, I realized that she had a lot of experience. While playing mahjong, she instructed the maid to pour tea and bring a fruit plate for me. Silently, I just stared blankly at her back. I thought, if I had asked her to come home to play mahjong when she was marching generously and passionately, she would have spat at me, or even regarded me as a lunatic.</p>
<p>While I was thinking, the two children ran upstairs, shouting:</p>
<p>"Mommy, take us to see a movie."</p>
<p>However, the mother, who was concentrating on making a big hand in mahjong, didn't bother to deal with the children. She just impatiently stuffed a few banknotes into the children's hands.</p>
<p>"Be good and go play poker yourselves!"</p>
<p>But the children pouted and said, "We don't want to!"</p>
<p>Then go play pushing cards with the maid!</p>
<p>"We don't want to either!"</p>
<p>It was the mother's turn to draw a card, thinking of drawing a self-touching good card to make a fortune. The lady across from her was about to lay down her cards.</p>
<p>"It's three times the limit!"</p>
<p>Annoyed, Aunt Hui drew back her hand and slapped the children several times.</p>
<p>"You little devils! You're so noisy!"</p>
<p>The children burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Maid!" She shouted petulantly, "Take them to buy candy in the alley!"</p>
<p>I stared blankly and couldn't sit still anymore.</p>
<p>I got up hastily to say goodbye, without even listening to what the host said to keep me.</p>
<p>After leaving the gate, I took a deep breath. I feel...</p>
<h3>In a Remote and Desolate Valley</h3>
<p>— Rong Shengcai</p>
<p>There is not a single</p>
<p>easy path to take. Even a narrow path</p>
<p>cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Rocky mountains,</p>
<p>like giant beasts, crouch all around. But I don't want to shout: There is no road, no road! I feel: You can still stand on the rocks. Taking the first step, you can naturally take the second, third, fourth... Wouldn't that become "walking"? Isn't what you can walk on a "road"? Of course, there isn't a single</p>
<p>easy path to take, not even a narrow path,</p>
<p>cannot be seen. However, finally,</p>
<p>I lifted my foot and began to step onto the first step on the sharp and angular rocks...</p>
<h3>Poem for Elderly Master Zhi'an's Golden Wedding Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>The sun and moon pass like a fleeting glimpse, grandchildren suddenly fill the hall. Never imagined that today, with white hair, you still resemble your red makeup from the past. In the mirror, time flows swiftly. Before the lamp, old stories are long. From now on, may we cherish [our time together]. Morning and evening, we both...</p>
<p>With a jug of wine, he is addressed as "Huang", adorned with simple hairpins, she faces herself. Among them, there are many children and grandchildren. In old age, there are still worries about rice and firewood. Family affairs are lost to the enemy's pillow. Heaven's heart enters the leaning tower. The [sound of insects] in the courtyard has already faded away.</p>
<h3>The Widow's Waiting</h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>In the abandoned slums, military husbands, coolies, and poor people are lurking. Military husbands, coolies, and poor people, like Yongda, are filled with sorrow and ruthlessness.</p>
<p>She looks at the gloomy coolies, the old cart drivers of the alleys. In the passage of years, her hidden pain does not disappear in the gray twilight. She sees the sorrowful, ruthless, and tired faces again;</p>
<p>Everything is a microcosm of the past, but without the husband and beloved son who were destroyed (claimed as aid to study).</p>
<h3>Record of Stockpiling Medicine</h3>
<p>— Guan Renfa</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang smiled and carried a large box of things, striding into the pavilion's gate. Mrs. Zhang greeted him and said, "Meng Yizhi - Mr. Zhang's name, what did you buy back today?" While saying this, she took the things and placed them on the high table.</p>
<p>"Guess what?" He took off his shoes while saying.</p>
<p>"I know, it's the ... tonic injection." Mrs. Zhang had also read for a few years when she was young, and she knew the common characters. So she could easily read the product name printed on the side of the box.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang laughed: "You... I believe you must ask, why did I buy these tonic injections for no reason?" Mr. Zhang continued, "When I went to the office this morning, I met a classmate on the road who is now a technician at the [pharmacy]. He asked me, 'Besides working all day long, have you been doing anything else lately?' I replied that I hadn't, and he said, 'You can do some business! The price of Western medicine has been very stable these days, buying a few bottles of tonic injections, it will only take half a month to earn money. Would you like to buy some and try it out?' I didn't answer, and he continued, 'Recently, [tonic] injections are in short supply, I think if you buy them, you can definitely double your profit.' I said it was inconvenient to pay in cash, he said it didn't matter, so I bought the box, and the money will be returned to him after the goods are sold."</p>
<p>These few days, Mr. Zhang was very busy, running around. It was because he wanted to sell the five dozen tonic injections he had stockpiled, but this hard work weakened his body a lot, and his wife cared and admonished. "Xuezhi, you run around all day long, it's too tiring. These injection medicines won't starve at home, why do you have to sell them immediately?"</p>
<p>"You have to know, the money for these injections hasn't been paid off yet!" Mr. Zhang said in a sad tone, with a sad look on his face.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang was shocked.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was really too tired. He finally fell ill. After the doctor's diagnosis, there was no major illness, and he just needed to rest and recuperate, and he would recover. If he could get a few tonic injections, he would recover even faster.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Zhang heard the word "tonic injection," she immediately walked over, opened the cabinet door, took out the [tonic] injections that Mr. Zhang had fallen ill for, and asked the doctor, "Can tonic injections be used?" The doctor nodded and said, "If Mr. Zhang wants to inject, he has to come to my hospital every day."</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Zhang began to inject the [tonic] injections he had stockpiled himself.</p>
<p>The True Meaning of Life - Hua Sheng</p>
<p>Remember what Romain Rolland said: "The true meaning of life is to live life." Everyone has life, but not everyone has a true life. A true life can only be completed under the domination of fate, and is obtained from the struggle and contention with life. You have life, but you must also have a true life. Do you think that a comfortable life, a life without life, is life? Friends! You must know that there is nothing more worth keeping than a true life.</p>
<h3>Inscription for a Commemorative Album</h3>
<p>— Zhuge Xin</p>
<p>What words should I write in your albums? Every page in your hometown contains the words I want to say. If I repeat them again, it would only add to your albums. If I want to write something else that I want to say, there are too many things I want to say, and I'm afraid I can't finish writing everything I want to say even if I fill up the pages.</p>
<p>...So it's better to leave it blank! - If you want to commemorate having a friend like me, or a brother - I think: If I am worthy of being commemorated by you, then even without leaving a single trace of ink, I can still exist in your memories.</p>
<p>The universe to man is like a small duckweed in the vast ocean; without waves, there is no calm. Without parting, there is no joy in reunion. Without sadness, there is no feeling of extreme happiness. We should deeply understand it and... embrace it.</p>
<p>What is valuable about a person is the ability to think and to walk one's own path. Without correct thinking, there is no correct action. A person's survival lies in the ability to find food and "digest" food. Whether in terms of material or spiritual things, lacking this ability means not being a truly complete person.</p>
<p>We should be grateful that we were born in this turbulent century. Everything that is destroyed and damaged by ghosts and monsters must be recreated by the young people born in this era.</p>
<p>We should not overemphasize ourselves, fantasizing that we are like "gods," nor should we see ourselves as useless as walking corpses. Facing reality, we should strive to arm ourselves with peace and [strength], so that we can "radiate a light for every point we possess."</p>
<p>...I still have a lot to write, right? It's probably not easy to finish writing. But looking at it again, it's getting dark... If we can truly remember these words and live by them.</p>

<h3>The Second Open Basketball Tournament is About to Be Held - Offering Several Suggestions to the Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association and the Central Sports Department are jointly organizing the Second Open Basketball Tournament, and the registration was closed on the 17th of this month. A total of sixty-one strong Chinese and Western men's and women's teams participated in the competition. Many talents gathered together. It is a grand event. The future grand occasion is naturally expected. However, our citizens have many opinions on the basketball events of Western youth leagues, such as players beating referees, and spectators frequently arguing. The disorder is not limited to this. Protest incidents also occurred in the Morning Friends Cup. The authorities' slowness in handling matters cannot be tolerated. The gradual decline [in order] is not a matter of one day or two. However, taking advantage of the fact that the curtain has not yet risen, the author respectfully offers some humble opinions, hoping to learn from others' experiences to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>Order</p>
<p>For the arrangement of the competition, strive for evenness. Tense and exciting games should be appropriately adjusted. Otherwise, on days that are too crowded, order will inevitably be difficult to maintain. As for the ticket issue, it should be completely fair and selfless, and not based on personal relationships. The seats for reporters and players must not be nominal, as in the past, which caused various doubts. It is also necessary to add more staff. There should be training for scorers and timekeepers. (Staff must wear armbands.) The number of tickets should not be arbitrarily inflated, and there should be restrictions, so that the stadium will have good order.</p>
<p>Ticket Price</p>
<p>This point should be as low as possible within the possible range, in order to popularize it. The humble opinion is that it can be sold for twenty yuan in total, or divided into two types of fifteen and thirty yuan (but there must be clear boundaries, and it cannot be chaotic.)</p>
<p>Lighting</p>
<p>In the sound of saving electricity, we should not be too demanding, but if there is no adequate light, the players' performance will be affected. It is hoped that the authorities can find ways in other aspects and slightly increase the branch light during the games (the current hundred branch lights are too few, and forty branch lights should be added.)</p>
<p>Referee</p>
<p>There are many shortcomings regarding the refereeing in the Western Youth Basketball League. This publication has pointed out these shortcomings and offered points that referees should pay attention to, which can be used as a reference. In short, more excellent referees should be hired, and the monopoly system of the Western Youth League should be avoided.</p>
<p>Call Team Meeting</p>
<p>Each week, representatives from each team can be called together (without spending a penny) to hold a symposium, report on the progress of past games, and what should be improved. This will strengthen the progress of the league and also connect the feelings among the teams.</p>
<p>Strictly Punish Players Who Commit Fouls</p>
<p>This point is implemented by the football association. Players who commit serious fouls will be suspended or have their playing rights suspended for several weeks. However, in the basketball league, no such regulation has been seen. It is hoped that the committee can have this regulation, so that players will be wary, and immoral and barbaric behaviors can be reduced invisibly.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Popularization and Promotion</p>
<p>Past competitions have emphasized Group A, while Group B has been ignored, which is contrary to the original intention of promotion. Especially for the women's group, special promotion should be given. In fact, women's sports are becoming increasingly backward. Observing that the number of women's groups in this year's competition is five, it is truly commendable during this period. It is understood that the authorities are adopting a single-round robin system for the women's group. The humble opinion is that it is better to change it to a double-round robin system. If a single-round robin is adopted, there will only be ten games, and there will be few opportunities for mutual learning. To meet the original intention of promotion, they should be given more opportunities to compete. Adopting a double-round robin system is also beneficial and not difficult in the overall situation.</p>
<p>Install an Enlarged Talking Machine</p>
<p>Audiences inevitably have unfamiliar aspects regarding the rules. Therefore, an enlarging machine should be set up, and a reporter familiar with the rules should explain them when necessary, so that unnecessary misunderstandings can be eliminated. During breaks and before the start of the game, high-quality music should be broadcast to enhance the atmosphere of the stadium.</p>
<p>Handle Exit Routes After the Game</p>
<p>After the end of the Central Youth game, there is only one route to take, which is bound to be crowded and prone to incidents. Another exit door should be opened. (In fact, it can be done.) If so, the situation after the end of the game can be greatly improved.</p>
<p>Disclose Various Account Items</p>
<p>Various account items must be disclosed to avoid suspicion from the outside world, to show credibility, and to promote the true spirit of sports.</p>
<p>The above ten points are easily improved by the authorities. They are specially described for consideration. It is fortunate if they are not regarded as empty talk on paper, and it is fortunate if my words are accepted.</p>

<p>Many teams that registered for the Open Basketball Tournament and joined Group A were relegated to Group B by the authorities. Among them, Donghua has Jia Youliang and Han Longhai, Mingxing has Chen Xuechong, Shi Jiuquan, and Shen Da, and Youdui has Tao Shaosheng, Zou Ziren, He Xiaoguang, Fan Qingcheng, and other famous players. On the one hand, it reduces the interest of Group B, and on the other hand, it makes the above teams dissatisfied. Can the authorities reconsider?</p>
<p>Bao Songyuan joined Huaying. Bao has a scene in Wu Wenchao's film Huo Yuanjia. It seems that Bao is very interested in becoming a big star.</p>
<p>The Zhongbei team is revived and has joined the Open Basketball League. The northern style can once again excite fans.</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun of the Tongren basketball team may transfer to the Donghua basketball team. If so, it will become an all-Yijia team. Team leader Gong Yuan (not Xuan Aihou, as previously reported) can do his best to guide. With a family team achieving such results in the basketball world, the Long family deserves the credit. The Dahua basketball team among women's basketball teams is composed of female students from St. John's University. The team has excellent results, so the recorded teams that are making a lot of noise for a while may not be able to rest easy.</p>
<p>The Lianhua Lianyin Factory basketball team will set out for Suzhou next week. The Huaying basketball team is scheduled to set out for Jiaxing for the second time tomorrow. It is also heard that the four sisters Gong Qiuxia, Chen Juanjuan, Zhang Fan, and Chen Qi will also accompany them. Team leader Li Dashen, instructor Qian Xucang, and secretary-general Wu Wenchao will all go. Reporter Mei Bixian will also set off with the army. The Green team's women's basketball team originally planned to accompany them, but has decided to cancel it for other reasons.</p>
<p>In the Friends Cup basketball game, Dahua B played against Qingyan. After the game, Dahua B submitted a written protest, claiming that the timekeeper had failed to perform his duties. As a result, the authorities apologized to Dahua B. (According to the usual practice, if the protest is justified, it will be accepted; if it is unreasonable, the deposit will be confiscated. It is strange that there is an event where the deposit is returned and an apology is made.)</p>
<h3>Review of the Shanghai Football League - Donghua Warriors Seize Courage, a Shock is Good</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football Association's Group A League has entered the second round. At the time of close combat, Donghua maintained an undefeated record in the first round, leading the heroes and ranking first. Lianyi only lost once and followed closely behind. Yi Jing and the Portuguese Merchants' Overseas Chinese League also reorganized their troops, and their ambitions have not died. The Jewish Three Provinces will inevitably lag behind. The two giants of the Chinese team had battles last week and sang triumphant songs again. The public law of strong and weak is inevitable. Here is a review of the events of last week and hopes for this week.</p>
<p>Lianyi's Defense is Better Than Attack, the Jewish Army Collapses</p>
<p>Lianyi defeated the Jews by a score of 7 to 2, but the performance was not ideal. The goalkeeper Liu [name] Mo was absent due to official business, and the basketball player Lu Gu [name] was temporarily tested. The result was very disappointing, which shows that everything is not as simple as imagined. Those who are proficient in basketball may not be able to serve as a football goalkeeper. Xiao Lu should retreat and concentrate on basketball. Lianyi's central defense line was very good in this battle, which is why they won. In the art of football, the central defense line must assist the attack and retreat to defend. Calling forward and defending backward is the key to success. Song Lingsheng, the backbone of Lianyi, is an old hand in this area. Cai Nongmiao also worked hard that day. The forwards received a lot of support and worked hard, so there was no reason not to win. However, the performance of the forwards was not wonderful. Xu Wenqian had many tricks, but he did not fully carry out the passing of the center. Gao Baozheng was brave, but his position was not good. [Name] Yongyao was not used to being a forward, so it should not be said that he was not good, and Wing was disappointed. Fei Chunzhi had many points, and he should use speed and attack. He should avoid being too fancy. Yu Zhenyue's left wing lost its place. According to the wing position, the ball must be cut along the sideline to an appropriate position to create a scoring opportunity. However, Xiao Yu took the ball and went straight into the middle, hoping to succeed himself, which is very undesirable. It is hoped that Xiao Yu will strive to improve. The Jewish army was demoralized, and with a declining lineup, it is no wonder that they were defeated. If they don't refresh their troops, the reputation of "Dark Horse" will not be restored.</p>
<p>Han Longhai of Donghua Has Obvious Progress</p>
<p>Donghua's victory over the Portuguese Merchants relied entirely on Han Longhai's progress, with a breakthrough in development. The threat that the Portuguese Merchants suffered was all inflicted by Han alone. However, in the second half of the game, the two defenders of the Portuguese Merchants stood in front of Han, inducing him to be offside, and they fell into his trap. The number of offsides was no less than ten times, otherwise it would have been possible to score several more goals. To avoid offside, Donghua's rear guard should provide opportunities for advancing. When the opponent [name], they should not pass the ball through the middle, but must be beyond the front. Then the wing can connect. The ball has advanced to the front, so [name] can use his speed, and the opponent's two guards will not be able to catch up, and the mistake of offside can be avoided, and it is easy to attack the enemy's base. I wonder if the Donghua authorities also think my words are correct? Donghua's frontline suffered a loss in communication with Zhan Lin's absence. Therefore, the old generals have their own qualifications, which cannot be surpassed by the newcomers. In terms of Donghua's defense, it is becoming more and more excellent. Zhuang Youren and [name] Shutang have restored their heroic demeanor, and Zhang Banglun's goalkeeper is steady and reliable. In short, Donghua's momentum is strong, and the warriors are excited, so there are unexpected gains. The merchants do not seem to pay attention to the league. In fact, there is no hope in the league. Therefore, old generals such as Ma Shaner, Kaositan, and Aolie Zala have retired, and the war has turned out to be a mistake, and they have to bow their heads in the upcoming competition.</p>
<p>Yi Jing Utilizes Strength to Break Through the Weak Team</p>
<p>Yi Jing's defeat of the Three Provinces was expected, but it was unexpected that the score would be 8 to 2. I still remember the first round, when the Three Provinces only lost by a small margin of 3 to 2. Who would have expected such a slump last week? The reason is that Yi Jing is strong, so they used long passes. The Three Provinces are small and weak, so they were taken advantage of. Yi Jing has been playing better and better recently, and can use its ample power to adopt tactics such as remote pass, rapid advance, encirclement, and breakthrough. In the future, when Donghua and Lianyi meet them, they must use tactics to succeed. They are really a hidden danger.</p>
<p>This week there are three football games. Donghua will definitely beat Huatong, and Lianyi will steadily take the Three Provinces. However, the author hopes that Donghua and Lianyi can have an excellent performance in the winning battles, and not just win. In addition to convincing the losers, they can also get the benefits of football. How great it would be! The Portuguese Merchants and the Overseas Chinese League will definitely have a fierce battle. The Overseas Chinese League has not shown up for a long time, but they have been practicing very hard and will definitely have a good structure to restore the prestige of the Yi Haijun era. Fans should not think that the Western teams are fighting each other and are not worth watching. If they want to appreciate their football skills, they will definitely be satisfied and return.

<h3>Simple Exercise Methods for Physical Fitness (10) (3)</h3>
<p>— By Tom, Translated by Yide</p>
<p>Extend both arms straight out to the sides, palms facing down, hands closed. Turn the hands as far as possible to the right, then to the left. Do not lower the arms, keep them extended straight out. This movement affects the entire hip and shoulders. When clenching the hands, imagine holding a dumbbell, turn to the right, then to the left (ten times each).</p>
<p>Note that although this is simple, it is very easy to become fatigued if done according to the method. Therefore, for special practice or individual practice, twenty times is sufficient.</p>
<p>28. Muscles of the Calf</p>
<p>The calf is to the entire leg as the forearm is to the entire arm; the thigh and upper arm are also similar in proportion.</p>
<p>Walking develops the back of the calf muscle, while cycling develops the outside of it. This exercise can develop the entire calf, especially its inner upper part, and achieve the desired beautiful shape.</p>
<p>The gastrocnemius muscle cannot be considered completely beautiful if viewed only from the side; it must be viewed from the front or back.</p>
<p>Rise up on both feet, standing on the toes. The body should be straight, heels far from the floor. Maintain a balanced posture for a few seconds, then lower the heels to the ground, not heavily, or causing the body to sway back and forth. Also, walk on the toes.</p>
<p>Note that this method can treat insomnia; those who use their brains excessively, or those with mental fatigue, can also use it to rest at any time. If you feel tired while working, you might as well try lifting your feet and standing for a moment.</p>
<p>Slowly raise the muscles of the calf, up and down (ten times each).</p>
<p>Note that for special needs, do twenty-five to fifty times each up and down.</p>
<p>29. Muscles of the Thigh</p>
<p>The elasticity of a person's gait almost entirely depends on the muscles of the thigh, and not on the muscles of the calf.</p>
