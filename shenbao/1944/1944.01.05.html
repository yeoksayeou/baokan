<h3>今年所望於敎育界者</h3>
<p>人生三十而立，今我中華民國三二十三歲矣，但在國際間就任何方面言均未能達到「立」的境地，言念及此，不寒而慄。至於致此之原因，固非止一端，然敎育之不健全實為主因之一，蓋百年樹人乃立國之大計，事由人興亦即可由人而廢，亳厘千里，影響至大。爰際此歲序更新之時，略抒所見，以貢有心人士之探討。尤望敎育當局以及主持各學校者，早定計劃逐步實施，蓄三年之艾以療七年之病。</p>
<p>自遜淸末葉以來，中國由科池試敎育變為抄襲式敎育，而在最近數年中更流露敷衍頹廢之現象。此類基本上之乖謬以及精神上之病態，實難以求局部之改善。必也敎育最高當局了解共中實况，洞察其中癥結，並深感其潛伏之危險性，由警惕憬悟而產生其行使執權之毅力與勇氣，爭取一切人力與物力，以掃蕩一切危害我國敎育之障得，而後能排除萬難以奠堅强之基礎。主管敎育之大員，幸勿以淸高閑散自詡而自餒！</p>
<p>任何重大計畫之實施，莫不有賴於中級幹部，在敎育界亦何獨不然。故各級學校之負責人，應遵從部令切實施行，以大公無私不偏不頗之精神，感召同入向共同理想之目標邁步前進。無論公私學校處於目前之畸形環境，尤宜顧及敎職員之生活，以期减少其精神上之痛苦而多致力於敎育事業。官立學校之校長，理宜將實際狀况隨時呈報而敦促主管官廳通盤籌劃，加以改善。至於私立各學校之校長，所處之地位不同，經濟自主，有單獨支配之權，對於敎職同人直接接觸，必更知其生活之甘苦。且每期學費一次收齊而母須呈轉領發，難將各敎職員半年薪給於學期開始時掃數發淸，以便任其處理而免蝕耗，亦非不可能之事。縱有所未便，亦應公開代為經營平分餘潤，務使共受物價狂漲之不利影響盡量减少。否則月薪之數未减，而購買力之低落必每况而愈下。在學校當局利用同人之薪金，盤剝取利中飽自肥，於心何以自安，更何以督促同人奮發自强。須知敎育精神之發揚，有賴於同人之努力，則必先求其生活之安定而後可。</p>
<p>在中級幹部確能完成其承上啟下之使命以後，方能言整飭學風，充實內容。凡在敎育界服務之人士，孰不願致力於敎育事業，無奈在啼飢號寒之環境中，為衣食所壓迫，實無展其抱負之可能，凡靑年學子淸自純潔，又孰不願求眞實之學問，即使為人為己為名為利，亦應當多求些許智識，無奈在商店式之學校環境，亦於不知不覺之中而消失其朝氣。噫，斯誰之過歟？敎育破產為一切破產之先聲，朝野人士其三復思之。</p>
<h3>汪主席健康恢復昨主持政院會議　議决設置治理運河籌備處</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　汪主席施行手術割取背彈，傷口平復，外科療治兀畢後，繼續內科調補，精神健康，日見進步，並親臨主持四日行政院一九二次例會，茲誌會議錄如下：主席汪院長，秘書長周降庠，（甲）報吿事項（略）。（乙）討論事項：　院長交議擬設置治理運河籌備處直轄本院，並擬具該處暫行規程草案及開辦費等槪算書請公决案，决議通過，於經費除預備費珊除外，減半發給，着另行預算並呈中政會。　院長交議據社會福利部丁部長呈為擬具公立公益慈善事業管理要綱草案請鑒核等情，請公决案，决議修正通過，即由該部公佈施行，並呈報中政會備案。　院長交議據社會福利部丁部長呈為擬具私立公益慈善事業管理要綱草案請鑒核等情，經先由本院秘書處飭審查簽具意見請公决案，决議照審查意見修正通過，即由該部公佈施行，並呈報中政會備案。　院長交議據社會福利部丁部長呈送捐助社會福利經費褒獎規則草案一案，經先飭由本院秘書處審查簽具意見請公决案，决議照審查意見通過，即由該部公佈施行，並呈報中政會備案。（丙）任免事項，　院長提擬特派殷汝耕為治理運河籌備處主任案，决議通過，呈請國府明令，特派，並呈中政會追認，　外交部褚部長提擬在駐德大使李聖五未到任前以現駐柏林領事兼駐德大使館秘書王德寅兼充駐德臨時代辦請公决案，决議通過。</p>
<h3>洛勒爾與鮑斯　作交歡廣播　全亞洲解放即可實現</h3>
<p>馬尼拉四日中央社電　菲律賓總統洛勒爾及自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，四日七時二十分舉行交換廣播，洛勒爾在廣播中力陳菲律賓共和國之决意，茲誌其大意如次：我菲律賓共和國誕生迄今，雖尙未及三月，然在此期間，已確立政府之權威，獲取人民之信望，且巳於行政委員會內確保戰爭素材，並於物心兩方面謀求菲律賓之復興，此外諸般施事亦莫不隨之進展，吾等今後將盡力運用菲律賓之自由獨立，期能分担共榮圈內一員之資，且將積極建築得以協力之基礎，菲律賓共和國之人民，皆以光明之希望與不動之决心迎此新年，吾人確信得協力日本及大東亞各國，打碎英美數世紀之枷鎖，以達到大東亞民族名得其所之世界。</p>
<p>昭南四日中央社電　印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯廣播，大意如次：余會實騐過世界新秩序之創設，然而己歸失敗，查失敗之最大原因，係因對此支持之各國間缺乏誠意，與其實現方法之錯誤。又此等國家專利用聯盟機關，作為彼等利已主義之趨使，去年十一月於東京舉行之最初試騐，巳於最善之情勢下開始，因日本政府提案共同宣言即已說明其實騐，已由祟高理想而變為道義，日本國民問，已充滿此等之新覺悟，由於日本政府之努力，已予以必能成功之保證，一地域之實驗，即已成功，將來　必漸次　擴展至全世界。余確信大東亞新秩序乃全亞洲新秩序之前奏，進而成為世界新秩序之前奏，又最堪注意者，即雖於戰爭正酣中，我東亞仍節節遂行新秩序之建設，是以不待大東亞戰爭之終結，東亞新秩序之建設，即能實現。大東亞戰爭由於日軍之光輝勝利，東亞新秩序之建設，必能成功，一方東亞民族，由於新秧序之創設，為確保旣獲之自由，對最後勝利之信念，極為鞏固，今次戰爭將長期戰，然無論如何長期且困難，而日本及其盟國之完全勝利與印度之解放，乃必然之結果。且印度之解放與日本及其同盟國之勝利，頗有不可分之密切關係，故吾等當與日本駢肩携手，與共同敵人奮戰至最後勝利時止。吾等確信吾等之勝利，同樣吾等為確信戰後之治安，亦必須獲得必勝，蓋基於芷義道德而建設亞洲新秩序者，必可取得大東亞戰爭勝利之實效。</p>
<h3>菲政府決定　各部新人選</h3>
<p>馬尼刺四日中央社電　菲律賓共和國政府三日下午發表：菲總統洛勒爾。此次基於去　十二月二十日議會通過之「附與大總統改革行政機構權之法案」　　現在政府行政經構改革如次：現在之七部改為外交·內政·財政·司法·農業·資源·敎育·土木·交通·經濟及保健勞動福利九部。即現在之農商部改為農業資源部，敎育福利部分為敎育及保健勞　福利三部，新設經濟部　新部長除洛勒爾大總統兼任敎育內政兩部長外，其他各部悉由現任部長充任經濟及保健勞福利兩部長，　定最近　定之。</p>
<h3>建設昭南鐵道　具體計劃中</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　以地理學眼光觀察大東亞共榮圈，其地域極其廣大，又包括大陸性及海洋性兩地域，因此必須按資源地帶與工業地帶之區別，設定適宜之交通綫。自以上觀之，故大量輸送之海運與高速度之航空運輸實極重要，同時鐵路運輸亦為有力之運輸路，且可滲透政治力，礦其地位亦極重要。是乃整備此等海陸空運使之相互適應，實為當務之急，建設昭南鐵路（即大東亞縱貫鐵路）即建設大東亞之先決條件，關於此問題，各方面刻正作具體研究，該鐵路之完成雖尙有幾多困難，然此項大計劃則必須貫澈之，將來列可自昭南以飛機連絡蘇門答臘及爪哇方面，前途頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>日本屆通常議會　举行正式審議　一切議事預定三月竣事</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日本第八十四屆通常議會，年內議事已於年前一十七日討論竣事，遂暫吿休會，决定俟政府對議會之準備究畢後，於本月二十一日再繼續舉行，開始正式審議，日政府方面前於閣議中巳决定將昭和十九年度一般會計預算案，大增稅案及其他法案要綱二十六件提出議會，同時於上月三十一日之閣議中通過之法制局草擬之法律案十件，亦决定提出議會，至其他殘餘之法律案，亦即逐次擬就，交閣議審議，預定至遲於本月十一日之閣議中對之完全議决。又與此併　預定於七日之閣議决定各特別會計預算案，十四日之閣議决定追加預算案及臨時軍費預算案，於此期間並决定首相施政方針演說草案，政府之對議會已準備將急速使之完成。議會方面俟政府提出之法案决定後，貴衆兩院均自十二·三日起，即連續舉行調查部會聽取當局之說明，實行事前審議。又議會運營中心之衆議院方面，於年前二十三日之代議大會議中已闡明對議會基本態度，並已設置議會總務議會理事議案，審查會等運營機關，一切之準備均已完畢，議會之審議亦决定不拘於舊例，對政府提案審議，亦與預算案併行盡量發揮，審議議案之效率，預定於審議預算檢之二十一天之十天內審議竣事，即送交貴族院。同時貴族院亦呼應衆議院大體於一週間可將預算案審議完竣，此次議會如不發生特別事態，預定於三月內一切議事均可竣事。</p>
<p>北京通訊</p>
<h3>北國之冬</h3>
<p>忙了冰上健兒</p>
<p>北　冬來到處凍冰，是給年靑的朋友們一個戶外運動的好機會。雖然冰鞋的價格已經漲到不能再漲的地步，然而北海滑冰塲中的紅男綠女都是一樣的多，而這兩天到塲滑冰的人也來得特別的多。原來這是因為最近華北體育日報社打算於明年一月九日在北海漪蘭堂滑冰塲舉行全市化裝滑冰大會而引起一般冰上健兒的興趣，特別來練習的。據說這一次滑冰大會是男女不分組的，這更可以引起一般靑年男女的興頭，何况還要請日本著名男女滑冰專家來參加表演，更可增色不淺哩。不但如此，聽銳該社主持人還要請一大批坤伶，如李毓芳，梁小驚，實芷苓，繆暢秋，張玉英，高玉情，　　雲，李婉雲，白王薇，言懸珠等來剪綵，這總可以算是一塲有趣的戰時的戶外運動大會了。</p>
<p>防空演習認眞</p>
<p>這兩天是北京舉行綜合防空演習，不但是晚間就是白天也常常鳴嗚一聲，到處車馬停止行動。最有趣的是這一次的演習，就像眞的一樣，天空扎扎之聲是「敵機」的來臨，而地上砰砰之響是擊射「敵機」的高射砲。飛機上不時不時的丟下白色的圓團，這是炸彈；中了這圓團之人，就是受傷；受了傷就得臥倒地上，絲亳不得彈動；於是就有救護隊走來把犧牲者抬上病床，送入病院療治。這種演習，莊嚴之中又帶有趣味，實在是很有意義的。</p>
<p>冬令座談流行</p>
<p>不知道從那兒學來的，故都的人士不管是屬於那一界都時髦着「座談」，而且「座談」的確是無座不談，不是空座而不談的。隨便拿一張報紙來做統計罷。本月十四日北京晨報第四版本地新聞中一北載有二十四段新聞，其中就有三項關於座談會的「北京市商會明日舉行聖戰二週年座議會」，「市府今日召開靑年座談會」、「慶祝聖戰二週年紀念敎局昨舉行座談會」。這裹所述的三項座談會中也居然有市商會的座談會。商人也有閒悄來「座談」，可知時代是較從前進步得多了。（十二月二十二日方舟寄）</p>

<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　由柯洛斯頓西進之蘇軍伐吐丁麾下第一烏克蘭戰綫軍，三日正午以來，在距舊烏克關邊境五哩之奧遼夫斯克至諾佛格勒渥爾因斯克之五十公里戰綫上，與安秀塔因麾下之德軍精銳在風雪中展開罕見之大機動戰，德軍陸續增援豫備兵，拼命退止蘇軍之痛烈突破進攻。冬季戰裝備優秀之蘇軍，其攻勢之熾烈貫出意外，故戰局極為險惡，德軍消息亦確認以上為實情。據德軍事記者塞托留斯大尉三日訊，基輔西部戰綫之德軍一因天氣不良及其他條件，已採取柔軟之防禦戰術，現尙未把握大規模反攻之機會。</p>
<p>析林四日中央社電　據海通社訊：齊托米爾區各處激戰未已，傳蘇軍在城西北獲有進展，城南及西南則未見順利，現城西北激戰方酣，其他各處之攻勢已見陰。今冬東綫氣候遠不若前兩年之寒冷，故德方對於朱來發展，態度殊為鎭靜，而德兵已習慣蘇聯之冬季氣候，且在齊托米爾之戰中，每俟德生力軍開到，或蘇軍損失重大時，敵攻勢即被阻。尼科波爾尼普員特羅夫斯克及維特勃斯克方面，戰事已」趨和綏。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據德國新聞社自軍界方面獲息：敵軍一營於二日進攻坎達拉克厦戰綫，被德軍集中之砲火所擊潰，同時德軍重砲猛轟列寗格勒之工業區軍警與行政官署等建築物。</p>
<p>聶伯河下游激戰進行中</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫南部戰事之主要重心，在於基輔之西，同時更南在聶伯河下游區，蘇軍向尼科波爾橋頭堡與柴普魯基區之一切進攻，均被德軍擊退，强大之蘇軍編隊在貝拉耶察爾柯夫與齊托米爾之間若干處發動進攻，但遭遇德軍堅强之抵抗，而蒙受重大之損失，該處戰事現仍在進行中，目前戰局中足堪注意之一點，為無論向南或向西，蘇軍均未獲得行動之自由，德守軍以當地後備兵加入作戰，或縮短其受有危險之各據點之戰錢，藉以防止敵尖劈形之進攻。</p>
<h3>駐渝緬印　美軍副司令　由蘇爾頓充任</h3>

<h3>義境風雪交加德衝鋒隊活躍</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：義南部德衝鋒活動，各處之大雪顯然適合於德軍高山部隊，星期日德軍二編隊發動製擊，穿入敵之後方，而消滅根據地數處，美軍在極大離散　下所修補完成之橋梁二座，為炸藥所毀，給養庫與燃料料庫亦被炸毀·沿加里格利亞諾作戰之德衝鋒軍一隊，在河之南岸克拉克將軍之美第五軍最前綫之後留田駐四十八小時，而後在該處大肆破壞，該衝鋒隊於晚間渡河而返，未受任何損失。同時加拿大衝鋒軍一隊當其在托馬索之德軍地雷陣中失迷路途時，幾完全被殲。奧爾托納之北，亞特里亞沿海岸附近，敵屢次試行進攻，但被擊退。英第八軍顯然正在整頓其部隊，以便補充其最近損失中所引起之缺額，</p>

<h3>準備攻緬聲中　印度軍隊的內情</h3>
<p>過去一年來世界戰局的波動，縮短了地中海，印度洋的距離，現在西歐任何種類的波濤，與緬甸的情勢，不能無關係。東亞的秘境緬甸，今為世界戰局的一環，敏　地反映其活動，其比重正迅速地在增大起來。這當然意義着大東亞戰爭與歐洲戰爭之息息相關，同時，在東亞最前綫的緬甸，東亞十億民衆的總力，業已建成銅牆鐵壁般的防綫。所有宣傳奪回緬甸電訊，無不涉其困難者，即為有力的證明。而大陸要綫的確保，愈措於磐石之安的現勢，事實勝於雄辯，證明奪回緬甸的不易。且印度內部情勢的不安，更為敵方危險的弱點，緬軍印度國民軍等走上歷史正軌的新興勢力，為敵所最恐怖的一點。自從去年十二月二十七日敵人向阿恰布區域開始第一次反攻以來，迄今已屆一年，今日緬甸周圍所經騐之顯著的質的變態，實為可驚。茲略述本年秋季開羅會談，蒙特巴頓麥克沃塞會見之後，以引起注意的歐慶萊克演說為中心，緬甸國民應付目前情勢的决戰態勢，並當地的動盪情形。</p>
<p>新印度軍的任務</p>
<p>據外電所傳與華維爾先後視察印度西北國境州的印度軍總司令官歐慶萊克，十三日在德里用無綫電演說，反覆解釋以前的印度戰綫因許多困難，準備未曾就緒，致不能苻合其期待，幷闡明新印度軍的任務，誇稱「緬甸奪回作戰的準備己吿完成」，其全部言論，始終在於辯明事實，且擬轉嫁未來開戰時的責任。據歐慶萊克聲稱：東部國境攻勢遲滯。一年來未見有何變化的原因，乃是由於邱士爾的指令，在北非戰綫，德蘇戰綫吿一叚落之前，專事維持現狀。而前進基地的推進及强化，亦由於飢饉，洪水，瘧疾及其他惡疫的流行而被妨阻。把阿拉貢敗戰以後的責任，歸之於自然的原因。其次，言及印度軍的新任務，緬甸方面新作戰的責任，單由蒙特巴頓的亞洲聯合軍司令部負責，印度單專任印度的防衛，且阿薩姆，孟加拉二州的東部區域，也由蒙特巴頓的部隊祖任，印度軍專担任國內軍隊的工作為主要原則，不參加作戰。把作戰的全部責任歸之於蒙特巴頓。</p>
<p>司令官的廣播和這些事實，包括二件值得注目的事實。</p>
<p>外國混合軍的編組</p>
<p>東南亞洲軍司令部設立以後，其所屬部隊，用美國來的援軍，非洲黑人兵，澳洲兵，新編渝軍等組成所謂混合外國軍，以替代以前的印度兵中心主義，以此為攻擊部隊，而將恐怕在戰綫上暴露弱點的印度兵主力退出第一綫。同時，為防備印度國內的動搖，使印度兵部隊專任戒嚴令下的戒備。現在東部國境戰綫，英美軍與渝軍的交替、美國大軍到達，新編渝軍的裝備將校均來自美國，並其他一切新的事實，很淸楚地喑示這戰錢之質的變化。</p>
<p>歐慶萊克繼又預吿日軍從所有國境綫進入的可能，且嚴密警戒因此而引起的印度國內的威脅與混亂，而稱印度軍擔任起新的國內防衛的任　。這說明其危險是怎樣的嚴重，其危機是怎樣的迫切。</p>
<p>設立尖兵學校</p>
<p>歐慶萊克又說：「日軍要通過國境，非通過陸路不可，那並不是有利的。」同時，為打消對日軍的恐　，曾費了相當的努力，他親身經歷阿拉貢悲劇的敎訓，故說：「印度軍要從沙漠作戰至森林戰鬥和巧妙的日軍戰爭，需要訓練。」所以新設以森林戰門的訓練為目的之尖兵學校，對抗日軍的銳鋒。</p>
<p>上述歐慶萊克的演說，雖際此非常的環境，亦頗見沉悶，始終不過在解釋十八個月來維持現狀的情形，至於緬甸攻勢，則完全還沒有準備完成。</p>
<p>海上攻勢的企圖，其徵兆亦不能說已趨活潑，從蒙特巴頓的就任看來，海上攻勢將佔特別高的比率。但在某種塲合有暴露其全部軍於印度洋上的危險，不能如四南太平洋方面島　作戰一樣大膽，這已是一種常識。季節風過去後一碧無涯的印度洋，將在敵人的焦燥與苦悶中，靜靜地過年吧！（翔：譯自十二月二十四日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>松島報道部長談　最近戰局情勢　大東亞戰爭分三階段</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐於四日本年首次會見記者團，闡明最近戰局情勢，略稱：敵自十月下旬以來，幾動員太平洋各地所有兵力，開始向所羅門新幾內亞方面日軍之占領地區實施反攻，此種行動與其稱為反攻，無寗可視之為進擊，此外緬甸及中國方面，情形亦屬相同，敵方之總反攻頗見酣烈。此不外敵方以為我占領地區之必勝不敗態勢，尙未調整完成，企圖乘機一舉，加以擊破之故，其實我軍對於敵方之此種總反攻，每利用內綫之利，予以重創而收得多大戰果。查大東亞戰爭可分為三個階段，第一階段乃奪回南方戰，即由英美手中奪回南方各國之一階段是也，此一階段業已完全達到目的，目下正進入第二階段之生產戰，此種生產戰，誠為最重大之一階段，蓋時有因數架飛機之差，而可决定戰事之大局也。第三階段為日軍之　　戰，進入此時期，　可　　得决定的勝利。為使第三階段之追擊戰，發揮最大效果起見，必須竭盡全能，致力於第二階段之生產戰。余最近曾回國一行，目覩積極增產情形，極感興奮，返觀此問，則仍多努力餘地，目今為决勝之秋，凡我當地人士，均應急起奮鬥，貫澈始終，以獲得大東亞戰爭之完勝。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>開市復業以後</h3>
<p>行莊年假期滿，今日開市復業了。舊曆正月初五，呌着「財神日」，各業商店，皆於是日開市復業；新曆一月五日並不呌着什麼「財神日」，可也於今日開市復業了，我們感覺此中應當有個經濟觀點的不同：在舊歷的今日，開市復業，祇是抱着恭喜發財，自私自利的思想、所以今日的希望充其量不過為一年中的營業，如何可以大獲其盈餘：可是在新歷的今日，尤其是在戰時的今日，開市復業，應當抱着不圖私利，顧全大局的思想，所以今日的希望，應當是如何使一年中的國民經濟實質强化起來，因為在整個國民經濟的崩潰中，祇是移言營業利潤，其結果亦必為「皮之不存，毛將焉附？」</p>
<p>所以，我們所希望於今年行莊開市復業以後者惟有兩點：　在積極性方面，本市各奶行錢莊以及信託公司等金融機關，從今開始，一致向生產之途邁進，盡力調劑各項正當生產事業之資金；對於農工增產所需要之資多，應由金融界多多組織銀團，共同承放，而國家銀行，在供給資金方面，尤能隨時為一般商業銀行之先鋒或後盾，以資彭勵，　在消極性方面，本市各行莊從今以後，益復厲行自肅政策，除供給生產事業之資金而外，一切含有投機性的借貸，一律予堵塞；此外，如銀行公會所修訂之通告各行莊收受節約儲蓄存款，辦理有獎定期存款，規定取締遠期木票辦法，一一都在切實推行之列，這樣一來，我們相信到了今年一年的總結束其，除了「銀錢各業安謐」一類應有的成績而外，還可以看到種種有裨於戰時國計民生的驚人成績呢！</p>

<h3>對於增加學費的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 平心</p>
<p>寒假到了，轉瞬又是春季開學，忽聞各級學校有增高學費之擬議。這個消息，會給大多數人嚴重的刺激！因為近頃物價激漲，民不聊生，訛無子女，誰忍令子女失學？在生活高壓之下，照原有的敎育費，己不勝負擔，何來如許鉅款，應付激增的學費？</p>
<p>照目前情形，各校支出方面，除非提高敎師待遇，可以酌加若干學費。否則如房租，房捐，並未增加，水電節約，並未增加；各種雜支，亦可盡量緊縮，為校長者應時刻為淸寒學十着想，為大多數淸苦的學生父兄着想；倘使學費加了，收入增了，而敎師依然不加薪，即加亦為數極微，其結果只是校長飽入私囊，於心何忍？有人說：「校長大都肥頭胖耳，敎師無不面黃肌瘦。」此種景象，令人悲憤，我為教育前途計，提供意見如下：</p>
<p>各校為增進敎師待遇，酌加學費若千，即以增加之數，作加薪之用，方為正當。</p>
<p>各校瑜加學費，應有一定標準，且須多設半費學額，以優待淸塞有志之土。</p>
<p>如有某校濫加學費，校長飽入私囊，學生父兄應寗報主管當局，加以處分。</p>
<p>敎育主管當局對各級學校所增學費，應加以審核，嚴予限制。</p>
<p>請各界殷富之士，體卹淸寒學子，捐款助學為國家培植有用之人才。</p>
<p>我常想靑年是國家米來的建設人才，是復興民族的柱石，所以栽培靑年，是社會每個人共有的責任，靑年如因家長淸貧而失學，致國家蒙意外的損失，這未免太可惜了！</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>靑春（九）</p>
<p>「牟田口！」聲音並不很大，眞人這樣地喊着，穿過庭院到隆夫的屋子十來了。已經是中學生了，所以不呌名字互相呼着姓。</p>
<p>隆夫的屋子，是和妹妹枝十同居的。情形和東京的中流家庭差不多。校子出去了，在書桌前邊，放着一個美麗的褥整。</p>
<p>「這本雜誌，你曉得麼？」隆夫把從天文館大街書店裹定購來的雜誌「海軍」，凌近眞人的面上。</p>
<p>「那也好，可是你知道中原猶介這個人麼？」眞人發生了疑問的時候，一定要追問到底。</p>
<p>「不曉得。」</p>
<p>「但是，在學校操塲的角落裹，　着那個人的碑呢！」</p>
<p>「碑？那種東西，我是不曉得的。」</p>
<p>隆夫什麼也不知道。他的興趣好像完全在這本雜誌「海軍」上，很鄭重地一頁頁地翻着</p>
<p>「看哪！這眞是長門，新式的戰艦。我將來也要作這樣大的軍襤的艦長……」</p>
<p>他的視　，完全　中　這雜誌的照片上。他的海軍狂，從進了中學後，越發的激昻起來了。那時候門口有脫皮鞋的聲音。好像是隆夫的父親已經從市公署回來了。聽見走過走廊下的足音，那見的　　是關着的。因為眞人不喜歡回他家裹人見面，所以他來的時候，隆夫立刻就把牠閉上。</p>
<p>那隔扇門豁然的開了。</p>
<p>「綿紙糊的，緊閉着，不熱麼……噢，眞人君，你在此地麼」。已經是六月了，穿着純白色夏服的隆夫的父親，脫着眼鏡笑了。他對自己兒子的好朋友，這樣溫　的性質，特別地喜歡。</p>
<p>如　在平日，眞人一定要紅着臉兒鞠躬行禮的，但是今大　對完了，便很仔細地問道，「伯父，請問您，中原猶介，是怎樣一個人？彬公時代的學者呢。」</p>
<p>「是醫師吧？」</p>
<p>「不是，是學者——科學家，一定是把照像和瓦斯燈輸人薩摩的人吧」？眞人忽然地　起來，大槪舍寗學，就是科學吧。</p>
<p>「不，等一等——他是個軍人吧？薩摩海軍的……」隆夫父親的話，有點不大明瞭，可是聽到了海軍，隆夫便把他那低着的頭抬起來了。</p>

        <h1>1944.01.05</h1>
<h3>What is Expected of the Education Sector This Year</h3>
<p>A man stands firm at thirty, and our Republic of China is now in its thirty-third year. However, in any aspect on the international stage, we have not achieved the state of "standing firm." Thinking of this makes me tremble with fear. As for the reasons for this, there is certainly more than one, but the unsoundness of education is indeed one of the main reasons. After all, cultivating people for a hundred years is a major plan for establishing a country. Matters are initiated by people and can also be ruined by them. Even a slight deviation can lead to enormous consequences. Therefore, as we enter this new year, I would like to briefly express my views for discussion by those who are interested. I especially hope that the education authorities and those in charge of various schools will establish plans as early as possible and implement them step by step, storing up three years' worth of moxa to cure seven years' worth of illness.</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, Chinese education has changed from the examination-based education of the imperial examination system to a copied form of education. In recent years, it has even revealed a perfunctory and decadent phenomenon. Such fundamental deviations and spiritual ailments are difficult to improve partially. It is essential that the highest education authorities understand the true situation, perceive the crux of the matter, and deeply feel its latent dangers. From vigilance and realization, they should generate the determination and courage to exercise their authority, strive for all human and material resources, and sweep away all obstacles that endanger our country's education. Only then can they overcome all difficulties to lay a solid foundation. I hope that the high-ranking officials in charge of education will not indulge in self-admiration for their purported purity and leisure, thereby undermining themselves!</p>
<p>The implementation of any major plan relies on middle-level cadres, and the education sector is no exception. Therefore, the heads of schools at all levels should follow the orders of the ministry and implement them conscientiously, using a spirit of impartiality and selflessness to inspire colleagues to move forward toward the common goal of ideals. Regardless of whether public or private schools are in the current deformed environment, they should especially consider the lives of teachers and staff, in order to reduce their mental suffering and devote more effort to education. The principals of government-run schools should report the actual situation at any time and urge the competent authorities to plan and improve the situation in an overall way. As for the principals of private schools, their position is different. They are economically independent and have the right to dispose of funds independently. They have direct contact with their teaching staff and must be more aware of their hardships. Moreover, it is not impossible to collect tuition fees in full at the beginning of each semester without having to submit and receive them through transfers. It should be possible to distribute half a year's salary to all teachers and staff at the beginning of the semester, so that they can manage it themselves and avoid erosion. Even if there are inconveniences, they should publicly manage the finances on behalf of the staff and share the remaining profits equally, so as to minimize the adverse impact of soaring prices. Otherwise, the amount of monthly salary will not decrease, but the purchasing power will inevitably decline. How can the school authorities use the salaries of their colleagues to exploit and enrich themselves, and how can they urge their colleagues to work hard and strive for self-improvement? It must be understood that the promotion of the spirit of education depends on the efforts of colleagues, so it is necessary to first seek the stability of their lives before it is possible.</p>
<p>Only after the middle-level cadres can truly fulfill their mission of connecting the top and the bottom can we talk about rectifying the academic atmosphere and enriching the content. All those who serve in the education sector, who would not want to devote themselves to the education cause? However, in an environment of hunger and cold, they are oppressed by the need for food and clothing, and there is really no possibility of realizing their ambitions. All young students are pure and innocent, and who would not want to seek true knowledge? Even if it is for oneself, for others, for fame, or for profit, one should seek some knowledge. However, in a store-like school environment, their vitality disappears unconsciously. Alas, whose fault is this? The bankruptcy of education is the prelude to all bankruptcies, and people in and out of government should think about this again and again.</p>
<h3>Wang Chairman Recovers Health, Presides Over Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday, Decides to Establish Preparatory Office for Governing the Grand Canal</h3>

It was resolved and approved.</p>
<h3>Laurel and Bose Make Congratulatory Broadcast, Liberation of All Asia Can Be Realized</h3>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel and Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, held an exchange broadcast at 7:20 on the 4th. Laurel emphasized the determination of the Philippine Republic in his broadcast. The main points are as follows: Although the Philippine Republic has been established for less than three months, during this period, the authority of the government has been established, the trust of the people has been gained, and war materials have been secured within the Administrative Committee. In addition, the restoration of the Philippines is being sought in both material and spiritual aspects, and all kinds of measures are progressing accordingly. We will do our best to utilize the freedom and independence of the Philippines, hoping to share the resources of a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and will actively build a foundation for cooperation. The people of the Philippine Republic welcome this new year with bright hopes and unwavering determination. We are convinced that by cooperating with Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia, we can break the shackles of Britain and the United States for centuries, so as to achieve a world in which the nations of Greater East Asia can each find their place.</p>
<p>Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency) - Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, broadcast, the main points are as follows: I have experimented with the creation of a new world order, but it has failed. The biggest reason for the failure is the lack of sincerity among the countries supporting it and the errors in its implementation. Moreover, these countries specialize in using the alliance mechanism as a means to serve their egoistic interests. The initial experiment held in Tokyo last November began under the best of circumstances, because the Japanese government's proposal for a joint declaration explained that this experiment had turned from a lofty ideal into a moral one. The Japanese people are filled with this new awakening, and the efforts of the Japanese government have guaranteed its success. An experiment in one region has been successful, and in the future, it will gradually expand to the world. I am convinced that the new order in Greater East Asia is a prelude to the new order in all of Asia, and will eventually become a prelude to the new world order. What is most noteworthy is that even in the midst of war, our East Asia is still steadily carrying out the construction of a new order, so without waiting for the end of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of the new order in East Asia can be realized. The Greater East Asia War, due to the brilliant victory of the Japanese army, will surely lead to the success of the construction of the new order in East Asia. On the other hand, the East Asian nations, due to the creation of the new order, have a very solid belief in the final victory in order to ensure the freedom they have already obtained. This war will be a long-term war, but no matter how long and difficult it is, the complete victory of Japan and its allies and the liberation of India are inevitable results. Moreover, the liberation of India and the victory of Japan and its allies are closely related and inseparable, so we should join hands with Japan and fight against the common enemy until the final victory. We are confident that our victory, just as we are confident that the security after the war, must also be won, because those who build a new order in Asia based on justice and morality will surely achieve the practical results of the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Philippine Government Decides on New Candidates for Various Ministries</h3>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Philippine Republic government announced on the afternoon of the 3rd that Philippine President Laurel, based on the "Bill Entrusting the President with the Power to Reform the Administrative Structure" passed by the Congress on December 20 last year, has reformed the current government administrative structure as follows: The current seven ministries have been changed to nine ministries: Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance, Justice, Agriculture, Resources, Education, Public Works, Transportation, Economy, and Health, Labor and Welfare. The current Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has been renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Resources, and the Ministry of Education and Welfare has been divided into three ministries: Education and Health, Labor and Welfare. A new Ministry of Economy has been established. In addition to President Laurel concurrently serving as the Minister of Education and the Minister of Interior, all other ministries will be filled by the current ministers. The two ministers of Economy and Health, Labor and Welfare will be appointed recently.</p>
<h3>Concrete Plan for Constructing Shonan Railway is Underway</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Observing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from a geographical perspective, its area is extremely vast, including both continental and maritime regions. Therefore, it is necessary to set up appropriate transportation lines according to the differences between resource zones and industrial zones. From the above point of view, mass transportation by sea and high-speed air transportation are extremely important. At the same time, railway transportation is also a powerful transportation route, and it can permeate political power, so its position is also extremely important. Therefore, it is an urgent task to integrate these sea, land, and air transportation methods to make them mutually adaptive. The construction of the Shonan Railway (i.e., the Great East Asia Transcontinental Railway) is a prerequisite for the construction of Great East Asia. Regarding this issue, various parties are currently conducting concrete research. Although there are still many difficulties in completing this railway, this major plan must be carried out. In the future, it will be possible to connect Sumatra and Java from Shonan by plane, and the future is promising.</p>
<h3>Japanese Regular Diet Holds Formal Deliberations, All Discussions Scheduled to Conclude in March</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The 84th regular session of the Japanese Diet completed its discussions for the year on the 17th of last year, and then temporarily adjourned. It was decided that once the government has completed its preparations for the Diet, it will continue to hold meetings on the 21st of this month to begin formal deliberations. The Japanese government had previously decided in the cabinet meeting to submit the general account budget proposal for the Showa 19th year, the large tax increase proposal, and the outlines of 26 other bills to the Diet. At the same time, the 10 draft laws drafted by the Legislation Bureau and passed in the cabinet meeting on the 31st of last month were also decided to be submitted to the Diet. As for the remaining bills, they will be drafted gradually, submitted to the cabinet for deliberation, and it is expected that they will be fully decided at the cabinet meeting on the 11th of this month at the latest. In addition, it is also planned to decide on the budget proposals for various special accounts at the cabinet meeting on the 7th, and the supplementary budget proposal and the temporary military expenditure budget proposal at the cabinet meeting on the 14th. During this period, the draft of the Prime Minister's policy speech will also be decided. The government's preparations for the Diet will be completed rapidly. After the government submits the bills, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will continuously hold investigative committees to listen to the explanations of the authorities and implement preliminary deliberations from the 12th and 13th. In addition, the House of Representatives, the center of Diet operation, has clarified its basic attitude toward the Diet in the general assembly of representatives on the 23rd of last year, and has established operating institutions such as the Diet Affairs Council, the Diet Steering Committee, and the Bill Review Committee. All preparations have been completed. It has also been decided that the Diet's deliberations will not be bound by old precedents. The deliberations on the government's proposals will be carried out in parallel with the budget proposal as much as possible, and the efficiency of deliberation on the bills will be maximized. It is expected that the deliberation on the budget will be completed within 10 days of the 21-day examination period and sent to the House of Peers. At the same time, the House of Peers will also respond to the House of Representatives and complete the deliberation of the budget proposal in about one week. If no special circumstances occur in this Diet session, it is expected that all deliberations can be completed within March.</p>

<h3>Winter in the North</h3>
<p>Busy Ice Athletes</p>
<p>Winter in the north has come, and the whole place is frozen, which is a good opportunity for young friends to do outdoor sports. Although the price of ice skates has risen to the point where it can't rise any further, there are still just as many red-clad men and green-clad women in the Beihai skating rink. In the last couple of days, especially many people have come to the rink to skate. It turns out that this is because the North China Sports Daily plans to hold a city-wide costume skating competition at the Yilantang skating rink in Beihai on January 9 next year, which has aroused the interest of the general ice athletes, who have come especially to practice. It is said that this skating competition will not be divided into male and female groups, which can arouse the interest of young men and women, and the fact that famous Japanese male and female skating experts will be invited to participate in the performance will add a lot of color to it. Not only that, I hear that the host of the Daily plans to invite a large number of Kunqu opera performers, such as Li Yufang, Liang Xiaojing, Shi Zhiling, Miao Changqiu, Zhang Yuying, Gao Yuqing, Zhao Yun, Li Wanyun, Bai Wangwei, and Yan Xuanzhu, to cut the ribbon. This can be regarded as an interesting wartime outdoor sports event.</p>
<p>Serious Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>These days, Beijing is holding comprehensive air defense drills. Not only at night, but also during the day, the sirens often wail, and cars and horses stop moving everywhere. The most interesting thing is that this exercise is like the real thing. The rustling sound in the sky is the arrival of "enemy planes", and the banging sound on the ground is the anti-aircraft guns shooting at "enemy planes". From time to time, white balls are dropped from the plane. These are bombs. Anyone hit by these balls is injured. If you are injured, you have to lie down on the ground and not move at all. Then, the ambulance team comes to carry the victims onto a hospital bed and send them to the hospital for treatment. This kind of exercise, solemn and interesting, is really very meaningful.</p>
<p>Winter Symposia Popular</p>
<p>I don't know where they learned it from, but people in the ancient capital, no matter which circles they belong to, are fashionable in holding "symposia." And "symposia" really are held with seats, not without seats. Just take a newspaper to make a statistic. On the fourth page of local news in the Beijing Morning Post on the 14th of this month, there are twenty-four pieces of news, three of which are about symposia: "Beijing Chamber of Commerce to Hold Holy War Second Anniversary Symposium Tomorrow", "City Government to Hold Youth Symposium Today", "Education Bureau Holds Symposium Yesterday to Celebrate Holy War Second Anniversary". Among the three symposia mentioned here, there is actually a symposium of the City Chamber of Commerce. Merchants also have leisure to "symposium", which shows that the times have progressed a lot from the past. (Sent by Fang Zhou on December 22)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Old Ukrainian Border; German Army Adopts Flexible Defensive Tactics</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since noon on the 3rd, Soviet forces of the First Ukrainian Front under Vatutin, advancing from Korosten, have been engaged in unusually large-scale mobile warfare amidst snowstorms with the elite German forces under Hans-Valentin Hube along a 50-kilometer front from Olyovs'k to Novohrad-Volyns'kyi, five miles from the old Ukrainian border. The German army is continuously reinforcing with reserve troops, desperately trying to halt the fierce Soviet breakthrough offensive. The intensity of the Soviet offensive, with their excellent winter warfare equipment, has been unexpected, making the situation extremely precarious. German sources have also confirmed the above. According to a dispatch on the 3rd from German military reporter Captain Seidtorius, the German army on the western front of Kyiv has adopted flexible defensive tactics due to unfavorable weather and other conditions, and has not yet seized an opportunity for a large-scale counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: Fierce battles continue in various areas of the Zhytomyr region. It is reported that Soviet forces have made progress northwest of the city, but have not fared as well south and southwest of the city. Fierce fighting is currently raging northwest of the city, while the offensive in other areas has begun to wane. The winter climate on the Eastern Front this year is far less cold than in the previous two years, so the German side's attitude toward future developments is quite calm. Furthermore, German soldiers have become accustomed to the Soviet winter climate. In the Battle of Zhytomyr, enemy offensives have been thwarted each time German reinforcements arrive or the Soviet forces suffer heavy losses. The fighting in the directions of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk, and Vitebsk has "become more moderate."</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to information obtained by the German News Agency from military circles: An enemy battalion attacked the Kantalaksha front on the 2nd, and was routed by concentrated German artillery fire. At the same time, German heavy artillery heavily bombarded industrial areas, military police, and administrative buildings in Leningrad.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Ongoing in the Lower Dnipro</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the German News Agency: The main focus of the fighting on the southern sector of the Eastern Front is west of Kyiv, and further south in the lower Dnipro region. All Soviet offensives towards the Nikopol bridgehead and the Zaporozhye region have been repelled by German forces. Strong Soviet formations launched attacks in several places between Bila Tserkva and Zhytomyr, but encountered strong German resistance and suffered heavy losses. The fighting in this area is still ongoing. One noteworthy point in the current situation is that the Soviet forces have not gained freedom of movement, whether to the south or west. German defenders are using local reserve troops to join the fighting, or shortening the battle lines of their endangered strongholds, in order to prevent enemy wedge-shaped offensives.</p>

<h3>Snow and Wind in Italy; German Assault Troops Active</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency dispatch: German assault activities in southern Italy. The heavy snow everywhere clearly suits the German mountain troops. On Sunday, two German formations launched a surprise attack, penetrating into the enemy's rear and destroying several bases. Two bridges, repaired by the Americans with great difficulty and dispersion, were destroyed by explosives, and supply depots and fuel depots were also blown up. A team of German assault troops operating along the Garigliano River stayed behind the front lines of General Clark's U.S. Fifth Army on the south bank of the river for forty-eight hours, and then carried out extensive sabotage in the area. The assault team crossed the river and returned in the evening without any losses. At the same time, a team of Canadian assault troops was almost completely wiped out when they lost their way in a German minefield in Tomasso. North of Ortona, near the Adriatic coast, the enemy repeatedly attempted to attack, but was repelled. The British Eighth Army is apparently reorganizing its troops to fill the vacancies caused by recent losses.</p>
<h3>New People's Society Sends Envoys to Visit Japan and Manchuria</h3>

<h3>Amid Preparations to Attack Burma: Inside the Indian Army</h3>
<p>The fluctuations in the global war situation over the past year have shortened the distance between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Now, any kind of upheaval in Western Europe is inextricably linked to the situation in Burma. The mysterious region of East Asia, Burma, is now a link in the global war. The reflection of its activities is acute, and its relative importance is rapidly increasing. This naturally signifies the close connection between the Greater East Asia War and the European War. At the same time, on the front lines of East Asia, Burma, the total power of the one billion people of East Asia has already built a copper wall and iron ramparts-like defense line. All propaganda about recapturing Burma invariably involves the difficulty of this task, which is strong proof. And the fact that the main continental lines are being secured more firmly than ever proves that recapturing Burma is not easy. Furthermore, the internal instability of India is a dangerous weakness for the enemy. The newly emerging forces such as the Burmese Army and the Indian National Army, which are on the right track of history, are the most terrifying point for the enemy. Since the enemy launched its first counterattack towards the Akyab area on December 27 of last year, a year has passed. The significant qualitative changes experienced around Burma today are indeed astonishing. The following is a brief description of the meeting in Cairo in the autumn of this year between Mountbatten and MacWorth, with the speech by Auchinleck, which attracted attention, as the center, the resolute stance of the Burmese people in coping with the current situation, and the turbulent situation in the area.</p>
<p>The Mission of the New Indian Army</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches, Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, who had successively inspected the northwest border states of India with Wavell, repeatedly explained in a radio broadcast in Delhi on the 13th that the former Indian front line had not been prepared due to many difficulties, so it could not meet its expectations. He also clarified the mission of the new Indian Army, boasting that "preparations for the Burma recapture operation have been completed." His entire speech was consistently aimed at clarifying the facts and attempting to shift responsibility for the future war. According to Auchinleck, the reason for the delayed offensive on the eastern border and the lack of change in the past year was due to Churchill's instructions to maintain the status quo until the North African front and the German-Soviet front had ended. And the advancement and strengthening of forward bases was also hindered by famine, floods, malaria and other epidemics, attributing the responsibility for the defeat of Alagón to natural causes. Next, speaking of the new mission of the Indian Army, the responsibility for the new operation in Burma is solely borne by Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, and India is solely responsible for the defense of India. Furthermore, the eastern areas of Assam and Bengal are also responsible by Mountbatten's troops. The main principle is that the Indian Army is solely responsible for domestic military work and does not participate in operations, placing the entire responsibility for operations on Mountbatten.</p>
<p>The commander's broadcast and these facts include two noteworthy facts.</p>
<p>The Composition of Foreign Mixed Forces</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Southeast Asia Command, its affiliated units, using reinforcements from the United States, African Black soldiers, Australian soldiers, and newly formed Chongqing troops, formed the so-called mixed foreign forces to replace the previous Indian soldier-centric approach. These troops were used as assault units, while the main force of the Indian soldiers, fearing that weaknesses would be exposed on the front lines, were withdrawn from the front lines. At the same time, to prevent domestic unrest in India, the Indian troops were assigned to guard duty under martial law. The interchange of British and American troops and Chongqing troops on the eastern border front, the arrival of large American forces, and the fact that the equipment and officers of the newly formed Chongqing troops all came from the United States, as well as other new facts, clearly suggest a qualitative change in this war.</p>
<p>Auchinleck then warned of the possibility of the Japanese army entering from all border lines, and closely guarded against the threats and confusion caused by this in India, and stated that the Indian Army would assume the new task of domestic defense. This shows how serious the danger is and how urgent the crisis is.</p>
<p>Establishing a Special Forces School</p>
<p>Auchinleck also said: "It is not advantageous for the Japanese army to pass through the border except by land." At the same time, in order to dispel fear of the Japanese army, considerable effort was made. He personally experienced the lessons of the Alagón tragedy, so he said: "The Indian Army needs training to fight from desert warfare to forest warfare and skillful Japanese warfare." Therefore, a new special forces school was established for the purpose of training in forest warfare to counter the sharp edge of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Auchinleck's speech, while being in this extraordinary environment, was quite dull. He only explained the situation of maintaining the status quo for the past eighteen months, and as for the Burmese offensive, it was not yet fully prepared.</p>
<p>The attempt at a maritime offensive, its signs cannot be said to have become active. Judging from Mountbatten's appointment, a maritime offensive will account for a particularly high proportion. However, in certain circumstances, there is a risk of exposing its entire army in the Indian Ocean, which cannot be as bold as the island-hopping operations in the South Pacific, which is common sense. After the monsoon season, the boundless Indian Ocean will pass quietly through the enemy's anxiety and distress! (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, December 24)</p>

<h3>Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Subsidies to be Paid from Today; Regulations of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The Central Reserve Bank has decided that from January 5th of this year, the first phase of payment for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be paid in subsidies (based on one-quarter of the face value of the deposit certificate). It is learned that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has completed preparations for the payment procedures. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Payment of subsidies (each bar weighing ten taels on the city scale) will be calculated at a rate of 40,000 yuan. If one-quarter of the face value of the deposit certificate exceeds 40,000 yuan, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will directly issue one bar of subsidy weighing ten taels on the city scale. For deposit certificates with a face value of less than 40,000 yuan, or with odd amounts, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will issue a receipt for collecting the subsidy. From the date of issue of this receipt, the depositor can collect the subsidy from the designated silver shop five days later. For example, if the face value of the deposit certificate is 380,200 yuan, the calculated value of the first phase of the subsidy payable is 95,500 yuan. Among them, 80,000 yuan will be directly issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank as two bars of subsidy. The remaining 15,500 yuan will be converted at a rate of 40,000 yuan per bar of subsidy, and 3 taels, 8 mace, 7 fen and 5 li should be obtained. This fractional amount can be collected from two to three designated silver shops (Lao Feng Xiang Yu Ji, Yang Qing He Fa Ji, Jing Fu Yuan Ji) by presenting the receipt.</p>
<h3>Chief of the Matsushima Press Department Discusses Recent War Situation: Greater East Asia War Divided into Three Stages</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with a group of reporters for the first time this year on the 4th to explain the recent war situation. He briefly stated that since late October, the enemy had mobilized all its forces in the Pacific to launch counterattacks against the Japanese-occupied areas in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. This action, rather than being called a counterattack, can be regarded as an offensive. In addition, the situation in Burma and China is similar, and the enemy's general counteroffensive is quite fierce. This is nothing more than the enemy thinking that the invincible posture of our occupied areas has not yet been adjusted, and attempting to take the opportunity to break through it in one fell swoop. In fact, our army has used the advantages of the inner lines to inflict heavy blows and achieve great results in response to this general counteroffensive by the enemy. The Greater East Asia War can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the war to regain the South, that is, the stage of regaining the Southern countries from Britain and the United States. This stage has already fully achieved its purpose, and we are now entering the second stage of the production war. This production war is indeed one of the most important stages, because the difference of a few aircraft can determine the overall situation of the war. The third stage is the pursuit war by the Japanese army. Entering this period, a decisive victory can be achieved. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the pursuit war in the third stage, we must do everything we can to devote ourselves to the production war in the second stage. I recently returned to the country for a trip and was very excited to witness the active increase in production. Looking back at this question, there is still much room for effort. Now is the autumn of decisive victory, and all local people should rise up and fight to the end in order to achieve a complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Clearance Starts on New Year's Day</p>
<p>In order to achieve close coordination with the Qingxiang work in the Qingxiang districts of the city and strengthen the Baojia in each district, the Municipal Baojia Members Association will first implement the household registration clearance work in the second, third, and fourth districts in the western suburbs of the city from New Year's Day. The Municipal Baojia Committee will supervise the implementation of the district government. Preparations were started earlier in order to be thorough. Therefore, the district chiefs and township chiefs of each district were once summoned to the Municipal Auditorium to listen to training and instructions on specific methods.</p>
<p>Organize Clearance Teams to Clear Households One by One</p>
<p>The period for the implementation of household registration clearance and reorganization of Baojia in each district is stipulated to be completed within two months.

<p>Cooked Water Industry Requests Supply of Coal Cinder</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Cooked Water Industry Association, at the request of all its members, has asked the authorities to supply a large quantity of coal cinder at a fair price for fuel.

<p>Temporary Measures for Coal Balls in Urban Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, in order to alleviate the coal shortage in the South City, Zhabei, and West Shanghai districts, has established a temporary coal ball rationing method, as follows: This temporary coal ball rationing will be in effect from today until the 10th. Each household can purchase from the nearest temporarily designated coal ball retailer with their household certificate (without regard to the assigned retailer number). The limit is one "city catty" per person. The retail price is 60 cents in national currency per "city catty." After the retailer sells the coal balls, they should stamp the back of the household certificate with the store's seal to prevent further purchases from other retailers. The quantity sold to each household should be recorded in detail with a number in a ledger for future reference. Retailers are prohibited from selling rationed coal balls fraudulently or reselling them at black market prices for profit. If discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Market Opens and Business Resumes</h3>
<p>After the Lunar New Year holidays, securities firms have reopened today. The fifth day of the Lunar New Year is called "Day of the God of Wealth," and businesses traditionally reopen on this day. Although January 5th of the Gregorian calendar is not called any "Day of the God of Wealth", businesses have also reopened today. We feel that there should be a difference in the economic perspective between these two: On today of the lunar calendar, the reopening of the market is merely motivated by the self-serving thought of congratulations and getting rich. Therefore, the hope for today is at most how to greatly increase profits in the year. However, on today of the Gregorian calendar, especially in today's wartime, the reopening of the market should be motivated by the thought of not seeking personal gain and considering the overall situation. Therefore, the hope for today should be how to substantially strengthen the national economy in the year, because in the collapse of the entire national economy, merely pursuing business profits will inevitably lead to "if the skin does not exist, what will the fur attach to?"</p>
<p>Therefore, we only hope for two things after the reopening of the market for securities firms this year: On the active side, all financial institutions in this city, such as money exchanges, banks, and trust companies, should, from now on, unanimously move towards the path of production and do their best to regulate the funds for various legitimate production undertakings. For the funds needed for agricultural and industrial production increase, the financial community should organize syndicates and jointly underwrite them. National banks, in supplying funds, should be at the forefront or provide support for general commercial banks at any time, to encourage them. On the passive side, all securities firms in this city should, from now on, strengthen their self-discipline policies. In addition to supplying funds for production undertakings, all speculative lending should be blocked. In addition, the notices revised by the Banking Association to guide various securities firms to accept thrift savings deposits, handle prize-winning fixed deposits, and regulate the method of prohibiting forward wood notes, are all being implemented in earnest. In this way, we believe that by the end of this year, in addition to the necessary achievements of "peace and tranquility in the silver and money industries," we can also see various amazing achievements that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood during wartime!</p>
<h3>Funds for Rice Procurement Can Be Borrowed from Syndicates, Adopting a Bill Discount and Acceptance System</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee has promulgated "Instructions for Handling Acceptance Bills" for the fund-raising matters required by rice and grain purchasing merchants in various regions. The full text is recorded as follows: Rice and grain purchasing trade association preparatory committees that have been approved by the committee may apply for loans when purchasing rice and grain in their purchasing areas. When applying for a loan, they must fill out an application form in the format prescribed by the committee and apply to the director of the committee. After being approved by the director, deputy director, and director and deputy director of the procurement and transportation department, and reviewed by the director of the finance department, an acceptance bill can be issued, limited to one-half of the required procurement funds. The payee of the acceptance bill is the preparatory committee of the rice and grain purchasing trade association in each region. The seal used on the preparatory committee's application and the bill must match the reserved seal. The payment period for the bill is limited to 60 days from the date of issuance, but it may be extended to 90 days in special circumstances.

<h3>A Few Opinions on Increasing Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Ping Xin</p>
<p>Winter vacation is here, and the spring semester is coming soon. Suddenly, I heard that schools at all levels are planning to increase tuition fees. This news will give most people a serious shock! Because prices have skyrocketed recently, and people are struggling to make a living, who would be willing to let their children drop out of school? Under the pressure of high living costs, even the original education expenses are already a burden. Where will such a huge sum of money come from to cope with the sharp increase in tuition fees?</p>
<p>According to the current situation, unless teacher salaries are increased, a small amount of tuition can be added to the school's expenses. Otherwise, such as rent and property tax, have not increased; water and electricity savings have not increased; and various miscellaneous expenses can also be tightened as much as possible. School principals should always think about the poor students and the parents of most poor students. If the tuition fee is increased and the income is increased, but the teachers' salaries are still not increased, or the increase is minimal, the result is only that the principal fills his own pockets. How can they bear to do so? Some people say, "Most principals are fat and bloated, while teachers are pale and thin." This scene is sad and infuriating. For the sake of the future of education, I offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1.  If each school increases tuition fees slightly to improve teacher salaries, it is right to use the increased amount for salary increases.</p>
<p>2.  Each school's tuition increase should have a certain standard, and more half-fee scholarships should be set up to give preferential treatment to poor and ambitious scholars.</p>
<p>3.  If a school increases tuition fees excessively and the principal fills his own pockets, students' parents should report it to the competent authorities for punishment.</p>
<p>4.  Education authorities should review and strictly limit the tuition fees increased by schools at all levels.</p>
<p>5.  Please, people of wealth from all walks of life, show consideration for poor students and donate money to help them study, so as to cultivate useful talents for the country.</p>
<p>I often think that young people are the future construction talents of the country and the pillars of the nation's revitalization. Therefore, cultivating young people is a common responsibility of everyone in society. It would be a great pity if young people dropped out of school due to their parents' poverty, causing unexpected losses to the country!</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (9)</p>
<p>"Mutaguchi!" The voice was not loud, but Masato shouted like this, coming through the courtyard to Tatsuo's house. They were already middle school students, so they called each other by their surnames instead of their given names.</p>
<p>Tatsuo's room was shared with his younger sister, Eda. The situation was similar to that of a middle-class family in Tokyo. The sister was not in at the moment, and on the desk, there was a beautiful cushion.</p>
<p>"Do you know this magazine?" Tatsuo held up the magazine "Navy," which he had subscribed to from the bookstore on Astronomy Avenue, close to Masato's face.</p>
<p>"That's fine, but do you know the person called Nakahara Yukai?" Masato would definitely ask to the end when he had a question.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"But, there is a monument to that person in the corner of the school playground!"</p>
<p>"A monument? I don't know about that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Tatsuo knew nothing. His interest seemed to be entirely in this magazine "Navy." He turned the pages carefully and solemnly.</p>
<p>"Look! This is the Nagato, a new type of battleship. I want to be the captain of such a big warship in the future..."</p>
<p>His gaze was completely focused on the photos in this magazine. His navy craze had intensified since he entered middle school. At that time, there was the sound of taking off shoes at the door. It seemed that Tatsuo's father had already returned from the city office. Hearing the sound of footsteps walking down the hallway, the sliding door was closed. Because Masato didn't like meeting people at his home, Tatsuo immediately closed it when he came.</p>
<p>The sliding door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>"It's just covered with cotton paper, closing it tightly, isn't it hot... Oh, Masato, are you here?" Tatsuo's father, who was already in June and wearing a pure white summer uniform, took off his glasses and smiled. He especially liked this gentle nature of his son's good friend.</p>
<p>If it were on a normal day, Masato would definitely blush and bow in greeting, but today, after the greeting, he asked very carefully, "Uncle, please, what kind of person was Nakahara Yukai? A scholar from the Bunkyu era?"</p>
<p>"Was he a doctor?"</p>
<p>"No, he was a scholar—a scientist. He must have been the one who introduced photography and gas lamps to Satsuma, right?" Masato suddenly cheered up. Generally speaking, science (舍寗學) must be science.</p>
<p>"No, wait a minute—was he a soldier? Of the Satsuma Navy..." Tatsuo's father's words were a little unclear, but when he heard the navy, Tatsuo raised his lowered head.</p>
