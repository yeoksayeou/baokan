<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>進步的貪官污吏　吉田東祐</h3>
<p>不久前，抽了一天空去遊杭州。實在是名不虛傳的杭州，而有許多令人驚奇不置的風景。共中最値得大書而特書者，就是常待車站前淸明節熱鬧擁擠的一幅風景畫。在該處穿着制服的人們，並非是趕着一羣走向屠塲的羔羊。因兩足動物不排成一宇長蛇陣，而在用棍棒無情地抽打着。當時有兩個乘客，由於後面的推擁，竟被擠出隊伍，於是棍棒起處，而一各乘客更頭破血出。眞不幸，這位乘客來車站時忘戴鋼盔，所以只好抱頭鼠竄。我排在這樣一個一字長蛇陣裏，恐怕絕對買布道票，所以我心慌意亂不知所措。恰好在這個時候，一位注視我好久的穿黑色制服者，很租靄地說，你到上海去，我賣給你票吧！於是從腰中掏出一把人人望眼欲穿的去上海的車票。但價格却是比定價高出三倍的。竟致筆者對於中國的貪官污吏，不能不嘆服其手段高明，而無微不入。</p>
<p>回顧二三年前，中國貪官所最慣用的手段，就是綁票和勒索。例如一件不幸的事情，即因重慶地方也住着中國人，所以有時候地們給上海朋友寫信。於是在信中，不免要寫幾句「當地近來天氣也好」的字樣。這樣一封普通信如落到貪官污吏的手裹，這位上海朋友就會大禍臨頭，就會被判爲重慶份子嫌疑犯，藉且「近來天氣也好」等字句是某種暗號，於是這位上海朋友就有資格去吃一個月或兩個月的官司。自然，解除這種嫌疑最有效的方法，並不是口若懸河的洋洋反證，而是默默不言的金錢（羅馬格言中說「雄辯是白銀，沈默是黃金」）。自從上帝相繼召還最愛用這種手段的人們後，這種過於露骨的手段，在上海業已不大流行了。然而代之以興者，就是賄賂公行。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭以來，中國一躍而爲法治國家，一切都受到了限制，無論作什麼事情，都要一一取得官廳的許可。否則，就一竅不通。然而普通中國人都知道，任何一件事，如由正面按公式手紋請求官廳，則回文一定是批駁二字。中國人的常識都知道，向官廳申請某種事件，如想迅速取得批准，就需要兩種東西來疏通官廳，一即是「面子」，二即是萬人迷的金錢。處於後者的塲合，貪官就拼命利用這種中國人的常識。例如，從業員向官廳請求提高某種物品平價的塲合，有決定權者是官廳。這就是貪官的好機會，於是就開始「直接交涉」，說「拿多少錢來，就給你批准」。經過「討價還價」的過程，而通融費決定後，就批准其平價提高。這樣，從業員並不太賠賬。因爲開消貪官的賄賂，會加在非買道種高價物品不可的大衆頭上。</p>
<p>而最後出現者，就是前面巳經講過的關於火車要的合法手段。法律中任何一條也沒有說，穿着黑制服的人買火車票是不對的。同時法律中任何一條也沒有說，把自己買的車票賣給別人是不對的。大家都知道，這既非賄賂，又非勒索。雖然規模有大小，但資本主義老前輩美國的貪官污吏，最慣用的就是這種合法手段。據說第一次世界大戰時，決定美國參戰者，並非美國政府，實際上是爲保障央法欠債而摩爾根財閥贈與眾政要人的賄賂作出所致。這位摩爾根財閥與政府要人「運絡」的最書通方法，就是分送股票。例如一九二九年二月，阿雷　尼股份有限公司成立的時候，分配給特別股東的一股，爲二十元，然而當時阿雷格尼股票的市價，爲三十一元至三十五元。領到這種分配的股票的股東，其中就有海軍部長富蘭西斯·亞丹（一千股），前任睦軍部長牛頓。德。白　（兩千股），前任財政部長麥卡道等要人。以二十元買進市價三十一元的股票一千股，那就等於收到一萬一千元的現款。現在眞不幸，中國也公然盛行道種合法的賄賂了。例如，在目前戰時體制下，絕對不必要的公司，竟以五千萬至二三萬萬元的資本而創立起來了。據說，黑市二十元一股的時候，而就十元一股地分配給公司產生時的出力要人了。（魯譯）</p>

<h3>日東條首相致辭</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日東條自相于日·德。義三國混合專門委員會席間致辭，全文誌次：日·德·義三國混合專門委員會，依三國條約規定，於今日舉行委員會，本人能藉此機會對諸君略進一言，洵感欣快，通觀戰局，英·美於諸戰中連戰皆北，自去年來狂呼總反攻傾其全力於東西進迫軸心地域之邊境，然吾堅陣並未稍爲動搖，爲德。義之必勝信念及不敗之態勢，使軸心陣營愈形鞏固。余對德。義盟軍之英勇奮門，實懷最大之敬意，就中德軍於義國戰綫，已將敵之進攻完全粉碎，復對倫敦開始大規模之轟炸，義軍則積極整備新陣容，立於共向戰綫之第一綫，共同奮鬥，聞之不勝欣慰。敵英·美於此情形下，愈形焦慮，最近彼等狂呼結成第二戰綫，然此實爲德國所期望者，余相信將來德軍不條可將敵人擊退，並可予英。美軍以澈底之打擊，俾日。德。義三國早日獲得最後之勝利。大東亞方面，日本現正粉碎英·美在大陸及太平洋方面之進攻企圖，並確保南方要塞，次於大東亞各國家，各民族之鞏固團結，一致推行戰爭及大東亞各地重要物資之戰力故日本之必勝態勢日益加强，日本決堅持此態勢，予敵以痛擊，俾早日完成此戰爭目的。最近日軍得緬甸國之絕大援助與印度國民軍共同進攻東印及已越過印緬園境，踏入印度領內，收獲偉大戰果，尤其江特拉鮑斯氏指揮之印度國民軍，正在全東亞之協力下，爲解放祖國而血戰，因此解放印度之空氣刻已瀰沒，此足證我等解放被壓迫民族之共同目的不久即可達成，海堪同慶。英·美爲自己之繁榮，犧牲他國，更企圖制覇世界，此實爲吾人所不容，此次戰爭，即我軸心各國爲自存，自衛，建設立足於正義之世界和平而行倔起，兩者么別，不言可喻矣。英·美兩國之野心，最近愈形露骨，反之，吾人澈底粉碎英·美之決意亦愈堅固，東亞戰塲雖相隔甚遠，軸心各國更須緊密提機，與敵英·美周旋，日本正在此情勢下，決加强與歐洲各盟邦之運絡，粉碎敵國離間軸心之種種策謀，推行共同戰爭，以期爭取共同之最後之勝利，達成共同的。余相信德。義兩國盟邦亦必其有此種決意，際此重大時期，舉行委員會，可謂適得其宜，於此謹祈木會之成功。</p>

<h3>伊姆法爾市兩面展開激烈白刃戰　敵不斷增援圖全力抵抗</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　印度前綫日軍某基地電，敵軍爲防術伊姆法爾，特以强力之援軍，對迫近該地南北兩方之日印軍作殊之抗爭，故該方面戰事益趨激烈，伊姆法爾北方十公里之戰略要點，近數日來依然進行中，雙方相距僅五十米左右，故近日來曾展開激烈之白刃戰。十一日，日印新銳到達後，即開始總攻，並繼續實施夜襲，至十二日晨將高地敵君殲滅大半，卒將之佔領。又該高地西方堅區森古麥（俾古拉頓基南方四公里（之爭奪戰，自十一日以來亦極劇烈，森古麥西方高地敵砲陣日夜不息，作精神式之砲擊，但日印軍亦以有力援眾繼續向敵軍肉搏。該方面戰塲上屍體遍野，其悽慘之狀，實令人不忍足賭，現在死守伊姆法爾之敵軍，因日軍之猛攻，已趨崩潰之夕矣。</p>

<h3>希臘新閣員　在開羅就職</h3>
<p>安加拉十五日中央社電　海通社訊：范尼齊洛斯主持之希臘新逃亡內閣，專已於昨日在開羅宣誓就職。</p>
<h3>印緬前綫　敵空中部隊受殲記</h3>
<p>三月上旬敵圖重開緬甸公路，在北緬全錢佈置堅固陣地，意欲擾亂日軍後方。自三月五日起，利用夜間，派遺英美渝印的混合空中遝輸挺身隊，在北緬甸上游加　附近降落，同時與富貢　南兩地區的地上部隊呼應，在北緬展開大規模的反攻。但經日軍陸空部隊的强製，轟炸東印度的敵空中部隊輸送基地，切斷其補給路棧，不消半個月，敵即陷於殲滅的運命，其企圖亦歸於粉碎。</p>
<p>空中部隊出擊</p>
<p>敵空中部隊係乘夜自印度阿薩姆省哈伊拉飛行場（西爾基亞西南面二十五公里）出發。擁有闊百呎長四十五呎的滑翔機約八十架，每二架由道格拉斯C一四七式運輸機一架拖曳，在多數戰鬥機掩護下，利用月光皎潔之夜，向加薩姆附近飛來。其中約六十架在加薩南面約六十公里處着落。這種由滑翔機運輸的挺身部隊，先遺一千名，更由拖航的道格拉斯機運來建設飛行塲的美國工兵部隊和迫擊砲高射機關砲等，立即開始建築飛機滑道。</p>
<p>其他二十架滑翔機，在加藤西方約八十公里處附近落下，機員遁人森林中，大部份被緬甸軍隊及協力的民衆，幾乎完全將其捕獲。更有一部隊，同樣在加薩東北六十公里附近降落。六日夜，復有空中部隊降下增援，並輸送迫擊砲及高射機關砲數門，大批的彈樂，燃料，機材和食糧等。其後專事夜間繼續補給，傘兵部隊亦與滑翔機部隊俱來。結果敵方的兵力計滑翔部隊二個旅團，降落傘部隊若干，合計約三千名以上，在伊拉瓦基河畔的加薩北面六十公里及其南面三十公里等處，各自建築飛行塲。旋以加薩姆南部降落的部隊為中心，開始行動，其統帥為去年在富重地區屢戰屢北的溫蓋特少將。</p>
<p>加薩南面降落一個旅團左右的敵軍，經加薩而向西南方地區行動，在加薩南面二十公里處渡越休埃里河，在加薩東方四十五公星的巨埃古方面行動，企圖進窺巴莫地區。同時加薩北面六十五公里處附近降落的約一個師國，企圖向馬烏爾加蕯地區西方進攻，一部份不斷在降落地點蠢動，與之相呼應的，北方有敵軍地上潛入部的南下，進出加薩西北方地區降落傘部隊的策應。</p>
<p>敵空軍亦傾全力，協助降落部隊，努力從事空中補給，攻擊日軍要點，射擊日軍部隊，竭力妨害日方的進攻。其時，從敵空軍協力的策源地登斯基亞方面，及一部份自西爾基爾方面，亦大規模出動應援。二十二日左右，富貢上空往來的敵機約百架，西爾基亞方面行動的敵機約三十架以上。敵方致力於機動空輸挺身部隊，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>殲滅經過</p>
<p>敵空軍雖傾全力輸送空中部隊，但是有勇無謀，結果非但不能杜絕印渝空路，相反的，日軍以破竹之勢，突入阿蕯姆省，一方面日陸軍部隊，視敵空中部隊如　中之龞，從容予以殲滅</p>
<p>日陸軍飛機，對於敵降落部隊及滑空塲，不斷施以攻擊。三月十日，日夜襲擊伊恩華的敵機塲，炸毀其滑空路。十三日，强襲加薩北面六十公里的莫尼恩敵飛行塲，昇空應戰的敵方噴火式飛機六架，被擊落，停留地面的滑翔機四架被擊毀。十四日拂曉，再處空襲該機場，炸彈全部命中，該機塲摧毀無遺。</p>
<p>迨至十八日止，日軍對於飛行塲及其周圍業林地帶的隱敝物，降落部隊等，實施猛擊十餘次，十八日午後，已不見敵踪，敵方飛行場及航空部隊，全歸覆滅。</p>
<p>敵挺身隊員的自述</p>
<p>敵以訓練未成熟的部隊，在緬甸北部叢林無人地帶降落，自不堪日軍精銳部隊的一擊。英國空軍挺身部隊破擊砲小隊的G·V·K軍曹，於三月五日，乘暗夜，侵入緬境，降落後第九日即十三日，在叢林中彷徨，結果被日軍擒獲，以下為該軍曹的自述。</p>
<p>一九四三年四月我所隸屬的印度派遺軍金格聯隊第一大隊，突然奉了特殊任務，向奧爾基亞（却希東面九十哩）移動。</p>
<p>從彼時起到十一月止的七個月內，我專門在森林地每日受滑翔機的昇降訓練，集合部隊，整備滑翔機，我被派為某某少佐指揮下的第三中隊迫擊砲小隊附下士官，帶有部屬兩名。</p>
<p>三月五日午前，奉命於當夜出發，我們集合在飛行場的一角，列隊報名，人人都感覺非常緊張，長四十多公里的滑道上，佈　着多數的滑翔機。其他的分　中隊，也作同樣準備。我們的滑翔機就兩架一對，由道格拉斯運聯機一架用長約五百公尺的繩索拖航，滑翔機縱十八公尺，橫三十公尺，輸送機的駕駛員為美國人。</p>
<p>是夜星光燦爛，月色皎潔地面除高山大川以外，一無所見。飛行約二小時，不知到了何處，只覺得轉了一個大　，曳航的繩索忽然切斷，我們悲壯的精神，達到了最高潮，滑翔機在附近轉了幾個大灣，落在地上，跟着我們的砲和彈藥也一同放在地上。這是一個樹林繁茂不知名稱的叢林地帶。</p>
<p>我們漸漸在業林的縫中散步，起初是十八人一同零亂地走着，經過幾天之後，幸而沒有遇到過一個日本兵心裏就漸漸寬鬆，疏於防範。可是事實不然。到了第九日，我和部下三人，悠然步出暖林，剛剛坐下，抽起烟來，忽然聽到一陣不快的聲普，設時遲那時快，約二十來個日本兵已發見我們趕來了。我是早就預備投降的，我的部下意見亦然，我們就不作無謂的抵抗，向日軍乞降了。（譯自三月二十九日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>岡崎參事致詞</p>
<p>日大使館事務所代表岡崎參事官致詞，路謂：本人今日能得比機會，代表日本方面致辭，實不務榮幸之至。自此次事變發生以來，日本軍方面，曾經將重慶系各種工廠，以及認為含有敵性關係官公民有土地建築物，一槪置於軍管理之下，並力圖予以保存，或予以活用，但自民國二十九年三月國民政府還都後，我方即決定交還移管，逐次實施解除敵產處匱，交還貴國當局及移管原所有者，關於軍管理工廠各種企業工廠四百二十二件，已於去年七月，將全部交還原所有者，或實施其他措置，均皆結東，現在此等工廠正由中國方面力予活用，以求建設新中國，另一方面關於重慶系財產即所謂舊敵產官公民有土地建築物，除去目下軍部使用若干者外，關於普通敵產處理委員會所受日軍委託管理運用中者，今年二月間，曾經將南京地區所在物件開始移交，然後各地物件亦逐次移管完畢，此次關於上海地區方面之五百三十五件，亦決定移交中國方面，計算所移交中國方面管理的淪系財產，連此次在內，一共達二千七百二十四件之多，由此看來，誠不勝愉快，我方更深切　　中國關係檢關，對於此等接收之移管財產，當為安定民生，完遂大東亞戰爭，採取遠當的處置。</p>
<p>吳秘書長謝詞</p>
<p>上海特別市政府吳秘書長頌臯於接管盟邦日當局代表移交渝系財產，代表政府向夢邦當局致答謝詞，略謂：本人今大奉命來接收貴國交還之渝方財產，實深愉快，此次水貴國將　方財產多交我國政府管理，政府人民均極感謝，本人代表政府向各位代表　　，決用妥善辦法加以管理，以不負日方移管之目的。</p>

<h3>减少米穀消耗　禁製造飴糖</h3>
<p>最近各地砂糖存底漸見稀薄，以致價格飛漲，製糖業商人相牽競購米榖，製造飴糖，以致米榖消耗數量激增，影響正當食戶，若不從速禁止，殊於糧食前途，妨時匪淺。米　統制委員會有鑒於斯，特電飭各地區辦事處，查禁利用米榖製造飴糖，並　請當地行政機關佈吿禁止製造，並函請軍警機關協助查禁，以減消耗而裕民食。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>碼頭服務</h3>
<p>車站輪埠，爲流氓地痞盤裾，利用旅客上下怱促的機會，施以巧取　奪的伎倆，遂其詐騙目的，這種事實，已爲各地各都市普遍現象，尤以上海為甚。過去，車站方面已經逐漸整飭，近年又因種種環境，行旅復感痛苦。而輸埠方面，往昔已然，近年更烈，行旅視爲畏途。</p>
<p>半年前，中國社會事業協會設置上海碼頭服務處，針對潛伏輪埠的洗氓宵小，剷除巧取豪奪，爲行旅服務，當然是非常需要的適切之舉，我們希望：</p>
<p>地方警察予以充分協力。本來輪埠碼頭有警察駐守，宵小應無法肆動。但事實上宵小嘈　，警察有時照顧不及。現在旣有碼頭服務處為旅客服務，則警察即可專事防範宵小，毋使活動得逞</p>
<p>碼頭服務處旣經呈准設立，則對於旅客服務的事權就須統一，絕對不應再有重複機構，而對旅客增加麻煩。如果事權紛雜，則不但碼頭服務處之效用消失，抑且使宵小多可乘之隙，結果仍是旅客倒霉。</p>

<h3>取締非法押當</h3>
<p>— 蕭振鎧</p>
<p>典當之設，邃古時非殘廢不能謀生者，不得為之。蓋坐收子母利，原非正業可比。惟貧　小民窘困時，恒賴以週轉濟急，對於平民經濟社會，尙不乏聊資輔助。邇年以還，該業當期已由十二個月，八個月，遞減至四個月，而利息則由一二分，倍　至六分，再加存箱棧租等，百元當本，除費息外，到手幾　七八十。升斗小民，遭斯厄境，已屬呌苦連天，貧不聊生。</p>
<p>不料本市近日更有一種非法押當業（或稱舊貨買賣商行，）興起專以乘人之危念，暴利取息是驚，以視典當，尤覺狡惡毒辣。此液設於南市民國路，露香園路及南陽橋各賭窟附近者，幾如　次擳此。對於財物之受賢，則擅於質票上刋註「受客委託代賣」字樣，居心殊屬叵測。期限則縮至卅天，利息則高至二三角。質期稍逾，即詭稱質物已售脫，非八九倍其値，不得贖回，貧苦者流，急勿暇擇，受其盤剝蹂躪者，實繁有徒，惑風不戢，猖厥益甚。刻下舊八區內各典當，亦紛起效尤，或改稱「舊貨買賣商行」，或標榜「兼營舊貨買賣」，如火如茶。似此掊克取利，不獨喪心病狂，且屬觸犯法綱。按乘他人急迫，輕率，或無經驗貸以金錢，而取得與原本顯不相當之重利，構成重利罪，又意圖為自已不法之所有，以詐術使人將本人之物交付者，構成詐欺罪，又以犯此為常業者加重科罰，刑法均分別著有明文。查該業之目的及手段，咸屬明知故犯，顯難憫恕。</p>
<p>為解除大多數平民疾苦起見，希望代表國家專司偵查犯菲之地方檢察署，能接受輿論，本其職權，依法檢舉控訴，按律懲罰，並一面咨請市警察局，協力執行，將全滬非法押當，槪予封閉，以彰國法，而袪小民重利　剝之苦。</p>
<p>同時並盼最近成立之市立公典（月息僅取二分牛）於貧民　集區域，如曹家渡，閘北等處，多設分典，藉以調劑下層經濟社會，而利民生。</p>
<h3>新普育堂巡禮</h3>
<p>— 昌辛</p>
<p>由陸院長和幾位中西修女姆姆，引導巡禮後，深感到新普育堂裏，所收容的，是可以看到苦難人們的一生過程，眞的，從離開母胎起，到八九十歲老年人為止，是一幅悽慘可憐人們的圖畫，在設備完美，管理週到，更用充份博愛的精神，撫慰收容下，確是苦難人們的樂園。當我們看見那些中西修女姆妣和陸院長，用慈祥的態度，對待苦難無吿的老幼，忍勞耐苦，盡義務的服務着，所以，我從深心裏發出來，萬分的欽佩。</p>
<p>為了故濟苦難無吿的人們，為了一個歷史久長，設備完美的大慈善機關——新普育堂，經費成爲恐慌，諸苦難人嗷嗷待哺，所以，我在這裏，極願大聲疾呼，急切盼望各界大善士，快伸出您們熱情的手來，慷慨地解囊，儘量的捐助吧！「救人一命，勝造七級浮屠」。更何况，救濟九百左右人的生命呢？我們深相信：「涓滴之水，可成江河」。所以不論捐助多少，一律用至誠的態度，代苦難者感謝。同時，讀者諸位得知道，與其為子孫積財，不如為子孫造福，爲子孫造福積德方法，就是捐錢救濟苦難的人們。語云：「爲善最樂」。</p>
<p>末了，我要再高呼三聲：「用錢用在慈善事業上，是心靈上永遠得着快樂！應做的事趕快做，不要等到過後再做來不及！要捐的錢趕快捐，不要等到錢已不在自己支配的時候，想捐也不能捐！（完）</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>鯊魚（三）</p>
<p>已經過了三天。</p>
<p>出　時的陰天，雖然一直繼續着，然而從昨晚起，氣壓不斷地降低了。波浪也益發屬害起來了。</p>
<p>「這恐怕要有吃不消的暴風雨吧；」一位士官次室士官像恫嚇候補生們地，笑着這樣說。</p>
<p>「毫不足怕，因為我們有中國海航行的經騐。」</p>
<p>「然而太平洋的天氣，可絕不止於那樣。你們要知道，太平洋總歸是太平洋呵！豈能以海來比擬呢？」</p>
<p>候補生們雖然不斷地假裝很懂太平洋，然而這是初次，所以只好聽別人的話。</p>
<p>「眞那樣麼？暴風雨是那樣厲害麽？」有的人，竟這樣發出小的聲音來。</p>
<p>須叟間，惡劣天氣眞地降臨了，風雨表的度數，逐漸上騰了。終於發出大暴風雨的準備號令</p>
<p>値班部的候補生們，在甲板上手忙脚亂地來回轉着，正在捆綁可動物的時候，突然開始了跌跤般的搖擺。看見排空的浪頭，竟比自己軍艦上的煙囱還高。</p>
<p>然而甲板上的候補生，還算運氣。在執行任務的期間，眞奇怪，並沒有感覺到暈船。操作部候補生，却正相反。在這樣繳烈的巓簸中，開始坐着上課了。</p>
<p>在艦內並沒有敎室那樣大的屋子。關閉在一個屋子中的年靑人的體臭，不斷增加着，竟把防備暴風雨而關閉上得舷窗玻璃，掛上了一層般地顚簸着。突然覺得天旋地轉，脚野頭重的時候,就覺得要吐出來，這正像胃袋倒反過來一樣，具有壓迫咽喉的感覺。</p>
<p>（他媽的！）</p>
<p>盡量忍耐，而想細心聽指導官的講演，但無論誰的面孔，都像草一樣變靑了。</p>
<p>眞人也没有例外。但與別人還有不同。他仍然端端正正的姿態，在記　演的大綱。</p>
<p>不大的功夫搖擺更加劇烈了。發着朝耳的雖聽聲音。方才對於縱的　　拼命抵抗的他們，現在這種　的搖擺，却是意外的劇烈襲擊。立刻就發現有人，用手壓着　，跑到艦室外去了。都好像忍耐不住了，一個一個地開始繼續不斷抵退席了。</p>
<p>眞人也從額養上落下冷汗來。呼吸也變得緊促了。</p>
<p>（巳經不行了……）正在這樣想時，就聽到指導觀發下「稍息」的號令。他不管三七二十一地跑到厠所去了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>雨過天靑，太平洋眞的太平了。第二天在艦內大掃除後，看見碧藍的海面上，閃閃地反射着太陽光綫。</p>
<p>「老谷，你俐不怕風浪，眞出乎我的意外。」中野候補生因為是頭一個跑出去嘔吐的，所以他不能不佩服眞人。</p>
<p>眞的。能够聽完昨天講演的傢伙，都是英雄！」加　候補生也在旁面抑上一句嘴。</p>
<p>眞人照例把一隻眼睛縮得很細，而微微地笑着說：「不瞞諸位說，我也嘔吐了。」</p>
<p>「你也吐了。」兩個人目瞪口呆地巽口司聲兌。「什麽時候？」</p>
<p>「什麼時候？就是在你們以後呵！」他毫不隱諱地把這件事情吿訴了大家。</p>
<p>「眞無用，你這個傢伙也吐了麼？」中野和加藤等，也一齊大笑了。假如講演再繼續一分鐘，或許眞人也要比敎觀早跑出艦室去吐也謂可知。實在可以說千鈞一髮，而眞人竟能支持下來。至於談到跑至厠所的心情，眞人笑着说：「我决不是不怕風浪的。先前談中國的小風雨時，曾說不怕，而現在這樣怕起來，豈不丟臉麼？」</p>
<p>「然而這樣說起來，問題就在於嘔吐的早晚了。最後嘔吐的老谷，總得說是偉大的。」岡山很坦白地承認了眞人的偉大。總而言之，大家旣然都吐了，那未也就用不着裝架子，同時對於顏「總之，聽講是需要在風平浪靜的時候。」於是暴風雨的話題，就算吿一段落。</p>

<h3>Progressive Corrupt Officials: Yoshida Tosuke</h3>
<p>Not long ago, I took a day off to visit Hangzhou. It truly lived up to its reputation, with many surprisingly beautiful scenes. Among them, what deserves special mention is the lively and crowded scene in front of the train station during the Qingming Festival. The people in uniform there were not leading a flock of lambs to the slaughter. Instead, these bipedal animals were not forming a long snake-like line, but were being mercilessly beaten with sticks. At that time, two passengers were pushed out of the line by the crowd behind them, and as the sticks came down, one of the passengers' heads was broken and bleeding. Unfortunately, this passenger forgot to wear a helmet when coming to the station, so they had to cover their head and scurry away. I was in such a long snake-like line, and I was afraid I would never get a ticket, so I was flustered and didn't know what to do. Just then, a person in a black uniform who had been watching me for a long time said kindly, "You're going to Shanghai, I'll sell you a ticket!" Then, from his waist, he pulled out a handful of train tickets to Shanghai that everyone was longing for. But the price was three times higher than the official price. This made the author admire the skillful and all-pervasive methods of Chinese corrupt officials.</p>
<p>Looking back two or three years, the most common methods used by Chinese corrupt officials were kidnapping and extortion. For example, one unfortunate thing was that because Chinese people also lived in Chongqing, they would sometimes write letters to friends in Shanghai. In the letters, they couldn't help but write a few words like "The weather has been good here recently." If such an ordinary letter fell into the hands of corrupt officials, the Shanghai friend would be in deep trouble and be suspected of being a Chongqing element, and the phrase "The weather has been good recently" would be considered some kind of code. Therefore, this Shanghai friend would be qualified to face a month or two of litigation. Naturally, the most effective way to dispel this suspicion was not eloquent refutation, but silent money (as the Roman maxim says, "Eloquence is silver, silence is gold"). Since God successively recalled the people who loved to use this method the most, this overly blatant method has become less popular in Shanghai. However, what has replaced it is widespread bribery.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, China has suddenly become a country ruled by law, and everything is subject to restrictions. No matter what you do, you must obtain permission from the government. Otherwise, you will not succeed. However, ordinary Chinese people know that if you apply to the government for anything by following the official procedures, the response will definitely be a rejection. Chinese common sense dictates that if you want to get approval quickly for something you are applying for from the government, you need two things to grease the wheels: one is "face," and the other is the universally loved money. In the latter case, corrupt officials desperately exploit this Chinese common sense. For example, when an employee asks the government to raise the official price of a certain item, the official has the power to decide. This is a good opportunity for corrupt officials, so they start "direct negotiations," saying "Give me some money, and I'll approve it for you." After a process of "bargaining," and after the facilitation fee is determined, the official approves the price increase. In this way, the employee doesn't lose too much. Because the bribes paid to the corrupt officials will be added to the prices of essential high-priced items borne by the public.</p>
<p>And finally, there is the legal means regarding train tickets that I have already mentioned. No law says that it is wrong for people in black uniforms to buy train tickets. At the same time, no law says that it is wrong to sell your own train tickets to others. Everyone knows that this is neither bribery nor extortion. Although the scale may vary, the most common method used by capitalist old-timers, the corrupt officials of the United States, is this kind of legal means. It is said that during World War I, the decision for the United States to join the war was not made by the US government, but was actually caused by the Morgan financial group giving bribes to many political figures to ensure that its debts to the central bank were repaid. The most common way for this Morgan financial group to "connect" with government officials was to distribute stocks. For example, when Allegheny Corporation was established in February 1929, one share allocated to special shareholders was 20 yuan, but at that time, the market price of Allegheny stock was 31 to 35 yuan. Among the shareholders who received this allocated stock were Secretary of the Navy Francis Adams (1,000 shares), former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker (2,000 shares), and former Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, among other important figures. Buying 1,000 shares of stock with a market price of 31 yuan for 20 yuan is equivalent to receiving 11,000 yuan in cash. Now, unfortunately, this kind of legal bribery is also openly prevalent in China. For example, under the current wartime system, companies that are absolutely unnecessary are being established with capital of 50 million to 200 million yuan. It is said that when the black market price is 20 yuan per share, shares are being allocated at 10 yuan per share to key figures at the time of the company's establishment. (Translated by Lu)</p>

Given the importance of this meeting, Prime Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Shimada also attended. During the meeting, the parties frankly exchanged views on various measures for Japan, Germany, Italy, and their allies to jointly wage war against the UK and the US. As a result of the discussions, a complete consensus was reached."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu held a dinner party at his official residence at 6:30 PM on the 15th to entertain German Ambassador Stahmer, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Princiville, and all members of the Joint Japanese-German-Italian Special Committee.

<h3>Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the Joint Japanese-German-Italian Special Committee meeting. The full text is as follows: "The Joint Japanese-German-Italian Special Committee is holding a meeting today in accordance with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact. I am delighted to have this opportunity to say a few words to you all. Looking at the overall war situation, the UK and the US have suffered defeats in every battle. Since last year, they have been shouting for a total counter-offensive and pouring all their efforts into pushing towards the borders of the Axis regions from the east and west. However, our strong defenses have not wavered in the slightest. The belief in victory and the undefeated state of Germany and Italy have made the Axis camp even more solid. I have the greatest respect for the brave struggles of the German and Italian allied forces. In particular, the German army on the Italian front has completely crushed the enemy's offensive and has resumed large-scale bombing of London. The Italian army is actively preparing a new formation and standing on the front line of the common front, fighting together, which is gratifying to hear. Under these circumstances, the enemy, the UK and the US, are becoming increasingly anxious. Recently, they have been clamoring for the formation of a second front, but this is exactly what Germany expects. I believe that in the future, the German army will not only be able to repel the enemy, but also inflict a thorough blow on the UK and US forces, so that Japan, Germany, and Italy can achieve final victory as soon as possible. In the Greater East Asia area, Japan is currently crushing the UK and US attempts to advance on the mainland and in the Pacific, and is securing the southern strongholds. In addition, the consolidation and unity of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia, the unified promotion of the war, and the strength of important resources in various parts of Greater East Asia are strengthening Japan's winning posture day by day. Japan is determined to maintain this posture, inflict a painful blow on the enemy, and complete the objectives of this war as soon as possible. Recently, the Japanese army has received great assistance from Burma and, together with the Indian National Army, is attacking East India and has crossed the Indo-Burmese border, stepping into Indian territory, achieving great results. In particular, the Indian National Army, commanded by Subhas Chandra Bose, is fighting for the liberation of its homeland with the cooperation of all of East Asia. Therefore, the atmosphere of liberating India is now spreading, which proves that our common goal of liberating the oppressed nations will soon be achieved, and we can all celebrate together. The UK and the US sacrifice other countries for their own prosperity and even attempt to dominate the world, which is unacceptable to us. This war is a righteous uprising by our Axis countries for self-preservation, self-defense, and the construction of world peace. The difference between the two is self-evident. The ambitions of the UK and the US have become increasingly blatant recently. Conversely, our determination to thoroughly crush the UK and the US has also become stronger. Although the East Asian battlefield is far away, the Axis countries must cooperate more closely to deal with the enemy, the UK and the US. Under these circumstances, Japan is determined to strengthen ties with European allies, crush the enemy's various conspiracies to alienate the Axis, and promote joint warfare in order to strive for the common final victory and achieve the common goal. I believe that the allied nations of Germany and Italy must also have this determination. Holding a committee at this important time can be said to be most appropriate. Here, I pray for the success of the meeting."</p>
<h3>Saburo Yamashita Appointed as Administrative Inspection Envoy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government has decided to implement the seventh administrative inspection to strengthen communication between China and Japan and has appointed Kamezo Yamashita, an advisor to the Cabinet, as the administrative inspection envoy. Mr. Yamashita was previously sent to Aomori and Hakodate in Japan in January of this year to inspect the special transportation status of coal, making significant contributions to improving wartime transportation capacity. This time, he will inspect transportation between China and Japan. Given his experience, positive results are expected, and much is anticipated from all quarters.</p>
<h3>Xing Shilian Speaks on the Anniversary of the Founding of the Manchukuo Army</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Xing Shilian, Minister of Military Affairs of Manchukuo, issued the following statement on the deeply significant anniversary of the founding of the Manchukuo Army: "Since the implementation of the National Military Service Law on April 15th of the seventh year of Kangde (1940), four years have passed. During this period, the Manchukuo Army has been steadily advancing according to its founding plan. The organization of the army and the quality of the soldiers have been completely renewed. It has now become a powerful army within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, bravely advancing on the path of a new world history transformation. The military authorities, in order to adapt to the current new situation, are implementing comprehensive reforms. We strive for perfection in military orders, education, and training. Furthermore, in view of the Manchukuo Army's unique characteristic of being composed of multiple ethnicities, we plan to make the greatest effort to permeate the concept of the unity of Japan and Manchukuo. Since the promulgation and implementation of the National Military Service Law, the Army Education Ordinance has also been promulgated, establishing the national military service system. The Army Internal Affairs Ordinance has been formulated, the Army Higher Military Academy has been established, and the reorganization of railway security and various other measures have been smoothly promoted. On this auspicious anniversary, we look forward to taking another step forward and striving towards the construction of the national army."</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft on Maritime Patrol Sinks Multiple Enemy Submarines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base: Japanese forces are maintaining extremely strict vigilance against the enemy submarines. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces are also highly active, so Japanese supply lines are becoming increasingly secure. On the afternoon of the 7th, a Japanese patrol plane was patrolling in a certain area when it suddenly discovered an enemy submarine surfaced. It immediately attacked, and one bomb hit the enemy submarine behind the bridge, causing it to sink immediately. At dawn on the 8th, a Japanese escort vessel, while sailing in a certain area, discovered the periscope of an enemy submarine protruding from the surface. It immediately fired dozens of torpedoes, and later saw a large amount of heavy oil floating on the surface, indicating that the enemy submarine had been sunk. On the morning of the 9th, a Japanese patrol plane, while patrolling in a certain area, again discovered an enemy periscope protruding from the surface. It immediately bombed it from the air, instantly sinking it. Also, at dawn on the 10th, a Japanese escort vessel, while sailing in a certain area, discovered an enemy submarine submerged nearby. It immediately fired a dozen torpedoes, also sinking it.</p>

<h3>Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds on Two Sides of Imphal; Enemy Continues to Reinforce and Resists with All Its Might</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Indian front, the enemy is putting up a desperate resistance with strong reinforcements against the Japanese and Indian forces approaching Imphal from the north and south in order to defend Imphal. As a result, the battles in that area are becoming increasingly fierce. The strategic stronghold ten kilometers north of Imphal has been under siege for several days, with the two sides only about 50 meters apart. Therefore, fierce hand-to-hand combat has been taking place in recent days. On the 11th, after the arrival of elite Japanese and Indian troops, a general offensive was launched, and night attacks continued. By the morning of the 12th, most of the enemy troops on the high ground had been annihilated, and it was finally captured. Also, the battle for Senkhumai, a stronghold west of this high ground (four kilometers south of Bishenpur), has also been extremely fierce since the 11th. The enemy artillery positions on the high ground west of Senkhumai have been carrying out ceaseless spiritual artillery fire day and night, but the Japanese and Indian forces are also continuing to engage the enemy in close combat with powerful reinforcements. Corpses are scattered across the battlefield in that area, and the tragic scene is truly unbearable to witness. Now, the enemy forces defending Imphal are on the verge of collapse due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese-Indian allied forces are currently advancing fiercely, cutting off the road between Bishnupur and Silchar, breaking through dangerous passes, and continuing to advance north with irresistible force. The main force reached the vicinity of Lanaima, ten kilometers southwest of Bishnupur, on the morning of the 13th, while a portion advanced to the Malon (high ground west of the Leimatak River), fifteen kilometers southwest of Bishnupur, threatening the only retreat route of the enemy's Fourth Army Corps. An attack posture has now been launched against Bishnupur. If the enemy loses Moirang and Bishnupur, Imphal, the stronghold of the Fourth Army Corps, will be threatened considerably. Therefore, the enemy is constantly dispatching reinforcement units with tanks and heavy artillery southward, trying its best to resist, but it is currently under heavy pressure from the Japanese army, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. The highway between Bishnupur and Silchar has not been used until now, but since the supply line from Kohima to Imphal was cut off by the Japanese army, the enemy has rapidly repaired the road, hoping to use it as an escape route. It has now been rebuilt into a fast road passable by cars, but both sides are currently engaged in a battle for control of the highway. Also, a unit of the Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army to cut off roads and penetrate deep into the enemy's ranks, launching surprise attacks at any time, and the enemy is in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>Indian Front Line, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in the Moirang area are currently continuing to put up stubborn resistance, relying on favorable terrain southwest of that area. Since dawn on the 13th, they have launched fierce artillery fire on the front of the Japanese and Indian forces in an attempt to stop the Japanese and Indian forces from advancing. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the vicinity of Moirang for several days. The enemy, due to the impact of the Japanese and Indian forces' flanking units, has moved towards the swampy area on the shores of Loktak Lake. The rearguard of the enemy's 23rd Division obtained reinforcements at midnight on the 13th and is now making a final stand there. Also, the enemy's Fourth Army is attempting to defend Imphal valley from annihilation by the Japanese army. Recently, it has been continuously airlifting reinforcements with large transport planes. The reinforcements from a certain area have been flying to the front line for several days, and the enemy's airlifted forces have shown a tendency to increase.</p>

<h3>National Government's Collaboration with Allied Forces Since Joining the War One Year Ago: Medals Awarded to Allied Generals</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government joined the war and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, the relations between the two countries have evolved from shared joys and sorrows to a life-and-death relationship. As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage and the National Government has been participating in the war for over a year, the outcomes of the collaborative operations between the Chinese and Japanese armies over the past year are what those concerned about national affairs eagerly want to know. To this end, we paid a visit to the military authorities and inquired about everything. What follows is a record of their conversation. During this period of participation in the war, our national army has consistently upheld the spirit of shared life and death with our allies. To cooperate with the Allied forces, the most notable instance was the Battle of Changde. When the Allied forces attacked Changde last year, the 12th Division and the Provisional 5th Division under the Wuhan Headquarters marched to the Shashi County area to collaborate with the Allied forces. From early November to late December, lasting over a month, they returned to their original defense posts after completing their mission.</p>

In the Gong'an County area, the Provisional 5th Division defeated the New Fourth Army and the Chongqing army, with 232 casualties and 4 prisoners captured from the Chongqing communist forces. The national government forces suffered only (25) casualties.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government returned to the capital, all military and political operations have proceeded very smoothly. Over the past four years, the cooperation received from various aspects of the Allied nations has been particularly appreciated.

<h3>Careful Processing Required for Company Registration Applications</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Recently, a responsible person from the Ministry of Industry stated that the Ministry has always strived for speed in handling company registration cases. It previously issued a circular to the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities, setting a deadline for review and transmission to avoid delays. Subsequently, considering that merchants and citizens in various regions may not be familiar with legal procedures and may inevitably make errors, instructions were given for supplementary corrections, which only added to the delays. The various procedures required for company registration applications were explained in detail and published in newspapers. Recently, applications for registration submitted to the Ministry have been processed promptly upon arrival. Even complex cases are expedited and completed within a set timeframe, with very few being backlogged. However, there are still many cases where procedures are not followed correctly, and instructions for corrections are issued. Recently, the Ministry has received reports from various regions stating that applications submitted later have been approved, while earlier applications have not yet been processed by the Ministry. All such cases are handled in sequence. The reason for the delay, after investigation, is often due to delays in correcting and resubmitting applications with incorrect procedures. Cases involving multiple transfers also take time. Some cases are not resubmitted after instructions are given, leaving no basis for processing. If companies could carefully handle matters before applying and ensure that procedures are complete, errors requiring corrections and delays would be avoided. It is hoped that all companies will pay attention to this. It was also stated that in recent applications for capital increases and registration changes, the investigation reports submitted by inspectors bear legal responsibility and should be handled with extra care to avoid false statements. The Ministry will also conduct direct investigations to verify the facts. If it is found that the reports submitted contain false or incomplete information, the company and the investigator will be held strictly accountable according to law. This is a special warning that relevant individuals in the business community should heed.</p>

<h3>Annihilation of Enemy Air Forces on the India-Burma Front</h3>
<p>In early March, the enemy attempted to reopen the Burma Road and deployed strong fortifications in northern Burma to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. Starting on March 5th, they dispatched mixed British, American, Chongqing, and Indian airborne troops at night, landing near Gassam in upper Burma and coordinating with ground forces in the Fugong and southern regions, launching a large-scale counteroffensive in northern Burma. However, after the Japanese army's ground and air forces forcefully bombed the enemy air force's transport bases in eastern India, cutting off their supply lines, the enemy was annihilated within half a month, and their attempt was crushed.</p>
<p>Air Force Attacks</p>
<p>The enemy air force departed at night from the Haira airfield in Assam Province, India (25 kilometers southwest of Sircia). They had approximately eighty gliders, each about one hundred feet wide and forty-five feet long. Two gliders were towed by one Douglas C-47 transport plane under the cover of numerous fighter planes. They flew towards the vicinity of Gassam on bright moonlit nights. Approximately sixty of them landed about sixty kilometers south of Gassam. This type of airborne unit transported by gliders first landed one thousand men, and then Douglas aircraft brought in American engineering troops to build airfields, as well as mortars, anti-aircraft machine guns, etc., and immediately began building aircraft runways.</p>
<p>The other twenty gliders landed near a location eighty kilometers west of Gato. The crew members fled into the forest, and most of them were captured by the Burmese army and cooperating civilians. Another unit landed about sixty kilometers northeast of Gassam. On the night of the 6th, additional airborne troops landed to reinforce them, along with several mortars and anti-aircraft machine guns, large quantities of ammunition, fuel, equipment, and food. Subsequently, they continued to resupply at night. Paratroopers also came with the glider troops. As a result, the enemy's strength amounted to two glider brigades, some parachute troops, totaling more than three thousand men. They built airfields sixty kilometers north and thirty kilometers south of Gassam on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The troops landed south of Gassam then began to move, with Major General Wingate, who had been repeatedly defeated in the Fugong region last year, as their commander.</p>
<p>About one brigade of enemy troops landed south of Gassam and moved southwest through Gassam, crossing the Hueri River twenty kilometers south of Gassam and operating towards Gyegu, forty-five kilometers east of Gassam, attempting to infiltrate the Bhamo area. At the same time, about one division that landed sixty-five kilometers north of Gassam attempted to attack west towards the Mawrgausa area. A portion of them constantly moved around the landing site, coordinating with enemy ground infiltration units moving south from the north, supporting the parachute troops landing in the northwest of Gassam.</p>
<p>The enemy air force also exerted all its strength to assist the landing troops, working hard to supply them by air, attacking Japanese army strongholds, and firing on Japanese army troops, trying to hinder the Japanese advance. At that time, a large-scale response also came from the enemy air force's support bases in Dinsukia and partially from Sircil. On the 22nd, about one hundred enemy planes flew over Fugong, and more than thirty enemy planes operated in the Sircil area. The enemy's dedication to the mobile air transport of airborne troops can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Annihilation Process</p>
<p>Although the enemy air force exerted all its strength to transport the airborne troops, it was reckless and imprudent. Not only did they fail to block the India-Chongqing air route, but on the contrary, the Japanese army broke through into Assam Province with unstoppable momentum. On the one hand, the Japanese army ground troops regarded the enemy air forces as turtles in an urn, and calmly annihilated them.</p>
<p>Japanese army planes constantly attacked the enemy landing troops and glider airfields. On March 10th, they attacked the enemy airfield in Ianwa day and night, destroying its glider runway. On the 13th, they strongly attacked the enemy airfield in Monien, sixty kilometers north of Gassam. Six enemy Spitfire planes that took off to intercept were shot down, and four gliders on the ground were destroyed. At dawn on the 14th, they again raided the airfield, and all the bombs hit their targets, completely destroying the airfield.</p>
<p>By the 18th, the Japanese army had launched more than ten fierce attacks on the airfield, the surrounding wooded areas used for concealment, and the landing troops. By the afternoon of the 18th, the enemy had disappeared, and all of the enemy's airfields and air forces had been annihilated.</p>
<p>Confessions of Enemy Airborne Troops</p>
<p>The enemy landed untrained troops in the uninhabited jungles of northern Burma, and they were no match for the attacks of the Japanese army's elite troops. G.V.K., a sergeant in the British Air Force Airborne Troops Mortar Squad, invaded Burmese territory on the dark night of March 5th. On the ninth day after landing, the 13th, he was wandering in the jungle and was captured by the Japanese army. The following is the sergeant's confession:</p>
<p>In April 1943, the First Battalion of the King's Regiment of the Indian Expeditionary Force to which I belonged suddenly received a special mission to move to Olkia (90 miles east of Kochidon).</p>
<p>From that time until November, for seven months, I specialized in glider takeoff and landing training in the forest every day, assembling troops, and maintaining gliders. I was assigned as a non-commissioned officer attached to the mortar squad of the Third Company under the command of a certain Major, with two subordinates.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 5th, we were ordered to depart that night. We gathered at a corner of the airfield, lined up and registered. Everyone felt very nervous. Numerous gliders were arranged on the runway, which was more than forty kilometers long. The other squadrons were also making similar preparations. Our gliders were paired, and each pair was towed by a Douglas transport plane with a rope about 500 meters long. The glider was eighteen meters long and thirty meters wide. The pilot of the transport plane was an American.</p>
<p>That night, the stars were bright, and the moon was bright. We could see nothing but high mountains and rivers on the ground. After flying for about two hours, I didn't know where we had arrived. I only felt like we had made a big turn. The towing rope was suddenly cut. Our heroic spirit reached its climax. The glider made several large turns nearby and landed on the ground. Then our cannons and ammunition were placed on the ground. This was a jungle area of ​​unknown name with lush trees.</p>
<p>We gradually walked through the gaps in the forest. At first, eighteen of us walked together in a disorderly manner. After a few days, we were lucky enough not to encounter a single Japanese soldier, and we gradually relaxed and became less vigilant. But the truth was not so. On the ninth day, my three subordinates and I leisurely walked out of the warm forest. Just as we sat down and started smoking, we suddenly heard an unpleasant sound. In a flash, about twenty Japanese soldiers had spotted us and were rushing over. I was prepared to surrender long ago, and my subordinates agreed. We didn't make any unnecessary resistance and begged the Japanese army to surrender us. (Translated from the March 29th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Speech by Counselor Okazaki</p>
<p>In his speech, Counselor Okazaki, representative of the Japanese Embassy Office, stated: "I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to deliver this speech today on behalf of the Japanese side. Since the outbreak of this incident, the Japanese military has placed various Chongqing-affiliated factories and land and buildings owned by officials, citizens, and organizations deemed to have hostile relations under military administration, and has strived to preserve them or utilize them. However, since the return of the National Government to the capital in March 1940, we have decided to return and transfer them, and have gradually implemented the release of enemy property and the return to the authorities of your country and the transfer to the original owners. Regarding the 422 factories and various industrial enterprises under military administration, all have been returned to their original owners or other measures have been implemented as of July last year, and all have been concluded. These factories are now being vigorously utilized by the Chinese side in order to build a new China. On the other hand, regarding the Chongqing-affiliated properties, that is, the so-called old enemy property, land and buildings owned by officials and citizens, except for some currently used by the military, we have delegated the management and operation of ordinary enemy property to the Enemy Property Disposal Committee. In February of this year, we began transferring properties located in the Nanjing area, and then properties in various places were gradually transferred. This time, we have decided to transfer 535 properties in the Shanghai area to the Chinese side. Including this transfer, the total number of Chongqing-affiliated properties managed by the Chinese side reaches as many as 2,724. It is a great pleasure to see this. We deeply cherish the relationship between China and Japan. Regarding these received and transferred properties, we will take appropriate measures to stabilize people's livelihoods and complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Upon receiving the Chongqing-affiliated properties transferred by the Allied Japanese authorities, Secretary-General Wu Songgao of the Shanghai Special Municipality delivered a speech of thanks to the Allied authorities on behalf of the government, stating: "I am very pleased to be ordered to receive the Chongqing-affiliated properties returned by your country today. The government and people are extremely grateful that your country is entrusting the management of these properties to our government. On behalf of the government, I express my gratitude to all the representatives, and I pledge to manage them properly in order to live up to the purpose of the Japanese transfer."</p>

<p>Gambling Dens Have Not Revived</p>
<p>_News Daily_ asked: Since all newspapers published news about the ban on gambling in the South City on the 29th of last month, citizens have been pleased. However, it is heard that gambling den operators are trying to revive their businesses and have been lobbying various parties. How will the authorities deal with this? The Secretariat replied: The government's policy on banning gambling has always been consistent and there has been no change. Recent rumors are not credible. If such activities occur, people are encouraged to report them, and the government will strictly crack down on them.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Allocation Insufficient</p>
<p>_Shen Bao_ asked: The allocation of coal briquettes is insufficient and distribution is not on schedule, leading to soaring black market prices. What measures will the authorities take?</p>
<p>The Economic Bureau replied: The matter of coal briquette allocation is currently being discussed with the Economic Office of the First District Public Office. A detailed response will be given after a decision is made.</p>
<p>Repair of Tianhou Temple Bridge</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: The Tianhou Temple Bridge, which connects the north and south banks of the Suzhou River, has a damaged bridge surface with a tabletop-sized hole. It has been over a year without repair, causing inconvenience to rickshaws and other vehicles. Has the authorities paid attention to this, and is there a plan for repair?</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau replied: It has been verified that the location is under the jurisdiction of the First District Office, and the bureau has already instructed them to expedite repairs.</p>
<h3>All Staff of the First District Office Hold Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Secretary-General Wu and Director Sun</h3>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Dock Services</h3>
<p>Train and ship stations are often places where hooligans and thugs gather, taking advantage of the hurried nature of travelers to commit petty theft and deception for their own fraudulent purposes. This phenomenon is common in cities everywhere, especially in Shanghai. In the past, train stations have been gradually improved, but recent circumstances have once again made travel difficult. As for ship stations, the situation was bad in the past, and it is even worse now, making them a dreaded experience for travelers.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, the Chinese Social Enterprise Association established the Shanghai Dock Service Center to target the lurking hooligans and petty thieves, eliminate extortion, and provide services for travelers. This is undoubtedly a very necessary and appropriate measure. We hope:</p>
<p>The local police will provide full cooperation. Police officers are stationed at docks, and hooligans should not be able to act recklessly. However, in reality, hooligans are rampant, and the police are sometimes unable to attend to everything. Now that there is a dock service center to serve passengers, the police can focus on preventing petty criminals from succeeding.</p>
<p>Since the dock service center has been approved and established, the authority over passenger services must be unified, and there should be no overlapping organizations that add trouble to travelers. If authority is fragmented, not only will the dock service center be ineffective, but it will also create more opportunities for petty criminals, and travelers will continue to suffer.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Savings to Absorb Idle Funds: Revised Savings Regulations for Consideration and Adoption by the Industry</h3>
<p>In order to encourage savings and channel social idle funds into increasing production, the banking and money industry has compiled deposit regulations from various businesses through the Banking Association. After multiple discussions and revisions, carefully preserving the advantages, a total of eleven chapters and eighty-two articles have been completed. Matters such as deadlines and interest rates are listed in a special table attached to the end for consideration and adoption by the industry. There are two points to note: Savings business is currently extremely weak, and the recovery of savings in the future is expected. Therefore, promoting and preparing for this business should not be delayed. Current market interest rates are high, and the interest rates in the attached table seem insufficient to promote savings under the current situation. However, the attached table is just an example and not mandatory. Moreover, current market interest rates are not normal, and this should not be taken as a basis for comparison. It is also heard that the regulations include: General Rules. Current Savings Deposits. Fixed Deposit Savings Deposits. Fixed Deposit Withdrawal Savings Deposits. Zero Deposit Fixed Savings Deposits. Installment Interest Savings Deposits. Education Savings Deposits. Group Savings Deposits. Convenient Savings Deposits. Gift Certificate Savings Deposits. Supplementary Provisions.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee to Hold Eleventh Meeting</h3>
<p>After completing the investigation of gauze, the Materials Investigation Committee is now conducting investigations of three essential goods related to people's livelihoods: matches, soap, and candles. The previously sealed gauze has been given a deadline for submission and application for sale. The sealed documents will be opened, and the investigation of matches, soap, and candles will be completed within a set time frame. A decision on investigating other materials will be discussed at the eleventh joint Chinese-Japanese committee meeting on the 21st of this month at 3 PM.</p>
<h3>Extension of Registration for Old Shares of Siming and Four Other Banks</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the China Industrial, China General Commerce, China National Products, and Siming banks last year, the government has taken over the official shares, while the commercial shares are being re-registered. The deadline for re-issuing new share certificates for the commercial shares was six months. The four banks have reported that the registration deadline for old commercial shares has expired, but many households have not yet registered. The Ministry of Finance has approved an extension of six months, until August 31 of this year. All shareholders of the commercial shares of the banks are urged to report their original shares and seals to the bank for registration as soon as possible to avoid further delay.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Illegal Pawnbroking</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhenkai</p>
<p>The establishment of pawnbroking originated in ancient times, reserved for those who were disabled and unable to make a living otherwise. Earning interest without labor was not considered a respectable profession. However, impoverished commoners often relied on it for temporary financial relief, providing some assistance to the economic and social life of ordinary people. In recent years, the pawning period has been reduced from twelve months to eight months, and then to four months. Interest rates have also increased from 12% to 60%, plus storage fees and other charges. For every 100 yuan pawned, only about 70 or 80 yuan remained after deductions. Ordinary people were already suffering and barely surviving.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a type of illegal pawnbroking (or second-hand goods trading companies) has recently emerged in the city, specializing in taking advantage of people's misfortune and seeking exorbitant profits, making them even more cunning and ruthless than regular pawnbrokers. These businesses are located near gambling dens on Minguo Road, Luxiangyuan Road, and Nanyang Bridge in the South City, almost as close as　This is especially evident when one is close to gambling dens. They cleverly note "entrusted by the customer to sell on their behalf" on pawn tickets when receiving goods, making their intentions suspicious. The term is shortened to 30 days, and the interest rate is as high as 20-30%. If the pawning term is slightly exceeded, they falsely claim that the pawned item has been sold, demanding eight or nine times its value for redemption. The poor have no time to choose and are exploited and trampled on. There are countless victims, and the trend is not curbed but is instead becoming more rampant. Currently, various pawnbrokers in the old eight districts are also following suit, either changing their names to "second-hand goods trading companies" or claiming to "also engage in second-hand goods trading," growing like wildfire. Such exploitation and profiteering are not only outrageous but also violate the law. According to criminal law, lending money to others in urgent, reckless, or inexperienced situations and obtaining a significant profit that is disproportionate to the original loan constitutes a usury crime. Furthermore, obtaining another person's property through deception with the intention of illegally possessing it constitutes a fraud crime. Heavier penalties are imposed on those who commit these crimes as a profession. The purpose and methods of these businesses are clearly intentional violations, making them difficult to pardon.</p>
<p>To alleviate the suffering of the majority of ordinary people, it is hoped that the local procuratorate, which represents the country and is responsible for investigating crimes, will accept public opinion, exercise its powers, prosecute according to the law, and punish these businesses. Furthermore, it is requested that the Municipal Police Bureau cooperate in enforcing the law and shut down all illegal pawnbroking businesses in Shanghai to uphold the law and alleviate the suffering of ordinary people from exorbitant interest rates.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is hoped that the recently established Municipal Public Pawnshop (with a monthly interest rate of only 2%) will set up more branch shops in impoverished areas, such as Caojiadu and Zhabei, to regulate the lower-level economy and improve people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the New General Benevolent Hall</h3>
<p>— Chang Xin</p>
<p>After touring the New General Benevolent Hall with Director Lu and several Chinese and foreign nuns, I deeply felt that the hall accommodates people throughout their lives, a truly tragic and pitiful picture from birth to the elderly in their eighties and nineties. With perfect facilities, careful management, and a spirit of abundant love, the hall provides comfort and care, making it a paradise for those who suffer. When we saw the Chinese and foreign nuns and Director Lu treat the helpless elderly and children with compassion, enduring hardships, and fulfilling their duties, I felt deep admiration from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>To save the helpless who suffer, for the sake of the New General Benevolent Hall, a large charitable institution with a long history and perfect facilities, funding has become a concern, and the suffering are crying out for help. Therefore, I would like to loudly appeal here, urgently hoping that benevolent people from all walks of life will extend their warm hands, generously donate, and contribute as much as possible! "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Moreover, what about saving the lives of around nine hundred people? We firmly believe that "a drop of water can form a river." Therefore, regardless of the amount donated, we will use a sincere attitude to thank on behalf of the suffering. At the same time, readers should know that it is better to create blessings for your descendants than to accumulate wealth for them. The way to create blessings and accumulate virtue for your descendants is to donate money to save the suffering. As the saying goes, "It is most joyful to do good."</p>
<p>Finally, I want to shout three more times: "Using money for charitable causes is a way to obtain lasting happiness in the soul! Do what should be done quickly, don't wait until it's too late! Donate the money you want to donate quickly, don't wait until the money is no longer under your control, and you can't donate even if you want to! (End)</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Shark (3)</p>
<p>Three days have passed.</p>
<p>The cloudy weather at the time of departure continued, but since last night, the atmospheric pressure has been steadily decreasing. The waves have also become more ferocious.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there will be a storm that we can't handle," a petty officer said to the cadets with a laugh, as if to intimidate them.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to fear because we have experience sailing in the Chinese seas."</p>
<p>"However, the weather in the Pacific is much more than that. You must know that the Pacific is the Pacific! How can it be compared to the sea?"</p>
<p>The cadets kept pretending that they knew a lot about the Pacific, but this was their first time, so they had to listen to others.</p>
<p>"Is that really so? Are storms that severe?" some people asked in small voices.</p>
<p>Soon, the bad weather really arrived, and the barometer gradually rose. Finally, the order to prepare for a major storm was issued.</p>
<p>The cadets on duty rushed back and forth on the deck, tying up movable objects. Suddenly, the ship began to rock as if tripping. They saw the waves rising into the air, even higher than the chimneys on their warship.</p>
<p>However, the cadets on deck were lucky. During the execution of the mission, strangely enough, they did not feel seasick. The cadets in the operations department, on the other hand, were the opposite. They started taking classes sitting down in such violent swaying.</p>
<p>There was no room as large as a classroom inside the ship. The body odor of the young people closed in a room kept increasing. The porthole glass that was closed to prepare for the storm was layered with moisture due to the motion of the ship. When they suddenly felt dizzy and their feet were on their head and their heads were heavy, they felt like they were going to throw up, which felt like their stomachs were turned upside down, with pressure on their throats.</p>
<p>(Damn it!)</p>
<p>They tried their best to endure and listen carefully to the instructor's lecture, but everyone's faces turned as green as grass.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin was no exception. But he was different from others. He was still sitting straight, taking notes on the outline of the lecture.</p>
<p>Soon, the swaying became more severe. Although they were struggling to resist the noises of the waves that entered their ears and the pitching motion that violently attacked them by surprise. Immediately, they found that some people were pressing their mouths and running out of the ship's chamber. They couldn't hold back, and one by one they began to retreat.</p>
<p>Cold sweat dripped from Mr. Jin's forehead. His breathing also became hurried.</p>
<p>(I can't go on...) Just as he was thinking this, he heard the instructor give the order to "take a break." He rushed to the restroom without thinking twice.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>After the rain, the sky cleared, and the Pacific was truly calm. The next day, after a thorough cleaning inside the ship, they saw the blue sea sparkling with sunlight.</p>
<p>"Lao Gu, I didn't expect you to be so afraid of storms," said Cadet Nakano, because he was the first to run out to vomit, so he couldn't help but admire Mr. Jin.</p>
<p>"That's right. The guys who could finish yesterday's lecture are all heroes!" Cadet Jiateng also added.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin habitually narrowed one eye and said with a slight smile, "To be honest, I also vomited."</p>
<p>"You also vomited?" The two were stunned and asked in unison. "When?"</p>
<p>"When? After you guys!" He told everyone the truth without hesitation.</p>
<p>"How useless. You threw up too?" Nakano and Kato, and others all laughed. If the lecture had continued for another minute, perhaps Mr. Jin would have run out of the ship's room to vomit even earlier than the instructor. It can be said that it was a close call, but Mr. Jin was able to hold on. As for his feelings when he ran to the toilet, Mr. Jin said with a smile: "I am by no means unafraid of storms. I said I was not afraid of the small storms in China, but now I am so afraid, wouldn't that be embarrassing?"</p>
<p>"However, that being said, the question is when you vomited. Lao Gu, who vomited last, must be said to be great," Okayama frankly acknowledged Mr. Jin's greatness. In short, since everyone vomited, there was no need to put on airs. At the same time, everyone agreed, "In short, lectures are needed when the sea is calm." So the topic of storms was considered finished.</p>
