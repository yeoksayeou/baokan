<h3 id="c1">社評　談歐洲戰局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>問：關於歐洲戰局，外間傳說紛紜，莫衷一是，敢問大勢如何？</p>
<p>答：德黑蘭會議所決議從東西南三面進攻德國，已因英美侵攻北法、義境英美軍北進，及東綫蘇軍開始夏季反攻而實現了。然而兩個月來，軍事的發展是不平衡的，英美軍在北法及義大利的作戰，極其迂綏，蘇軍在東綫的活動則較可注意。說到歐局，首須顧及這樣特徵。</p>
<p>問：那末，北法戰綫的情况如何？</p>
<p>答：英美軍在北法登陸，歷時二月，佔據地域，不過二萬五千平方公里，最深入部份，距離海岸綫亦尚不過三五十公里，距離柏林尚有一千公里之遠。在此狹隘地區，集中兵力達五百萬之多，因此損失極大，僅在登陸後八週間，已喪失戰車二千一百輛、飛機二千架、軍艦三十餘艘、運輸艦六十艘約三十萬噸，地面兵力損失約二十餘萬！現在英美已不得不改變戰略，向南方的勒恩區轉進，企圖使向盧昂—巴黎途上之美軍會攻巴黎，戰綫愈長，則補給愈難，無怪六十餘日的進展不出一百公里了。</p>
<p>問：義大利戰區的情况如何？</p>
<p>答：南綫反軸心軍的進展更爲迂緩。自侵入羅馬以來，雖拼命冒險北進，但已被阻於阿諾河沿岸一帶，著名的文化都市佛羅倫薩還是德軍爲保全歷史文化而退出的，所以最近四十日來，英美軍可說無甚進展，日昨雖有在熱那亞灣舉行新登陸的消息，但從地勢言，該處沿海多爲高山左帶，不易展開坦克大戰，結果也不過增加反軸心軍的消耗而已。軸心國在義國戰區，主要目的原來也就是牽制及消耗敵軍啊！</p>
<p>問：東綫的眞相如何？</p>
<p>答：德蘇戰爭三週年紀念日（六月廿二日）起，蘇軍從白俄羅斯與烏克蘭地區，以四個軍團一百萬以上的兵力，開始攻勢，其戰綫逐次作扇形擴大，現在北起愛沙尼亞國境的那爾伐城，南至舊波蘭南部要衝之羅夫（倫堡），長達一千二百公里以上·蘇軍已經突破一九三九年德蘇分轄國境綫，占領魯布林而強渡維斯拉河，企圖直撲華沙。北部則從波羅的海沿海三國猛進，企圖突破東普魯士的國境；南部則自羅夫至喀爾巴阡山，窺伺洪，捷，羅邊區。其形勢相當嚴重。但自日前東綫德軍一致改取攻勢以來，各綫蘇軍已被迫停滯或後退了。</p>
<p>問：從歐洲全局來看，前途趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：目前戰局的重心，在西方將爲保衛巴黎的大會戰，不過該方面反軸心軍行動迂緩，補給困難，德軍可以逸待勞，加以殲擊。東綫重心，將爲舊波蘭中原的大會戰，但戰局不取決於華沙一城，而將視維斯拉河的控制力究落誰手，其前途極堪注目。然而我們可以斷定德軍必能爭得主動者，第一，動叛變陰謀失敗以來，德國士氣昂揚，人力自員已臨新的階段，其後備力量絕不可侮；第二，時間爲決戰的勝利因素，而德國無疑願將是時間的主宰者，敵人愈深入則其補給與聯系將更困難，德國則愈感便利。第三，反軸心國的統帥部不統一，戰略目標紛歧，軍事愈進展則政治上的矛盾愈尖銳，反之德國則戰局愈進展而其團結與統一亦愈堅強！</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　日政府爲適應決戰時局，并確立實行防衛本木之重要施策，日前閣議會決定實施國民總武裝，使之具體化。此次大達內相爲急速加強國內警備態勢，乃於十一日閣議席上作重要發言，葢日本政府爲呼應軍事防衛態勢，整備國內各項體制，適應決戰情勢，亟應在有關之勞務，生產，交通，通訊，宣傳，食糧，厚生及一般國民方面，施行國內總武裝配置。關於其具體案，現正由內務省，軍需省，厚生省，農商省，交通省，文部省及情報局等，檢閱愼重研究中。日大達內相此次於閣議席上重行提出該案，足見日政府關心此點，又此項具體案之施行辦法，將於十五日之閣議席上正式通過。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日本大本營昨發表攻陷衡陽所獲戰果　渝軍將領及士兵頗多投誠 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午三時三十分，發表衡陽陷落時日軍所獲戰果，迄今判明其主要者如次：（一）俘虜第十軍軍長方先覺，及該軍參謀長，第一百九十新編第十暫編第五十四各師長以下二萬三千三百名。（二）鹵獲品有各種大砲百零一門，重輕機槍彈藥甚夥。</p>
<p>對華作戰入新階段</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日軍佔領衡陽城收獲之輝煌戰果，由日本大本營於十一日發表。日軍於六月二十八日起，逐漸對衡陽取包圍形勢，一面在湘江東西岸對四處蝟集之渝國援軍，展開包圍殲滅戰，一面著著整備攻擊態勢，終於四日半，渝軍堅守之衡陽即被日軍佔領。衡陽城於軍長方先覺指揮下，總兵力約四師，並在美軍指導官指導協助下，恃其優秀之裝備，及其堅固之防禦設施，一再頑強抵抗，終於不堪日軍猛擊，大半均被日軍殲滅。其餘半數以軍長爲首，參謀長各師長以次，約一萬三千三百分別携带武器投降日本，携带兵器爲大砲百零一門，輕重機槍五百二十挺，步槍約三千五百挺，及其他彈藥器材甚夥。投降渝軍裝備之優秀，爲渝軍中所罕見，加以美軍督戰及蔣介石之嚴命，故其戰意極爲堅強。據俘虜供稱：蔣介石爲鼓勵防守衡陽，七月二十六日曾頒賜賞辭，且不惜使用各種方式，訓練兵士戰意，然終不堪日軍痛擊。堅固之要衝卒爲日軍攻陷，不啻爲對渝美聯軍大陸對日戰略之一大打擊。重慶至北九州之距離，相當於塞班島至北九州，如今後日軍於大陸戰綫失去主導攻勢，日本本土，自太平洋遭受尼米茲苛烈之反攻，同時於大陸方面，仍得受渝美聯軍之熾烈反擊。如此則日軍之戰略態勢，將遭受現在以上之困難，自不難相象也。太平洋戰局，愈形苛烈，則中國戰綫方面，日軍勝利之途，亦愈形擴大。縱觀目前戰局，可知日本攻略衡陽之重大性。事實上自日軍控制衡陽以來，渝美空軍作爲空襲日本本土，及攻擊大東亞海域內日本海上運輸路之前進基地，已陷於半身不遂之狀態。同時粵漢以西地區之桂林，及其他各基地，亦已置於日機控制下，今駐渝美空軍向西北地區撤退，再以對滿鮮及北九州地區實施謀略性之遊擊空襲，故衡陽攻陷後，中國戰綫之戰，局已有新轉機，而渝軍自牙城衡陽失陷後，殆無士氣可言。又日軍於「不殺不燒不掠之三原則不作戰，故湖南一帶戰綫民眾咸欣然來歸，此由側面觀之，亦實有助於作戰之進展云。</p>
<p>渝軍遭剮喪失戰意</p>
<p>湖南前綫十一日中央社電　衡陽城內渝軍因遭日軍包圍猛攻，至日軍突入市中心後，即完全喪失戰意。八日晨，渝軍第十軍軍長方先覺，參謀長孫鳴玉，第三師長周慶祥，第百九十師長容有略，預備第十師代理師長李拔夫，及第五二四師長饒少偉等渝軍衡陽最高指揮者，終於與投降兵士同伍，高舉白旗來降。渝軍將領略歷如次：（一）第十軍軍長方先覺，宇子珊，江蘇省宿遷人，黃浦軍校第三期畢業，民國二十年任第十軍第十師副師長，二十九年昇任該師師長，三十一年昇任第十軍軍長。此次作戰開始，即被任爲直接防衛衡陽之責任者。（一）第三師師長周慶祥，字雲亭，現年四十歲，山東省莘縣人，黃浦軍校第四期步兵科畢業，民國二十六年任第三團團長，三十一年昇任師長。（一）第一百九十師師長容有略，字天殖，現年三十八歲，廣東省中山縣人，陸大特別班第四期畢業，民國三十二年昇任現職。（一）預備第十師代理師長李拔夫，現年四十四歲，湖南省零陵縣人，陸軍大學第十二期畢業，曾貿學蘇聯，民國三十二年代理師長，以迄於今</p>
<p>中央社訊　重慶軍事當局對衡陽陷落消息，日前僅以「與前方斷絕連絡情形不明」等方辭，企圖掩飾。十日夜，渝軍事委員會發表公報，卒承認衡陽已行陷落，並稱該市已於八日入日軍掌握。此次發表並言及衡陽守軍謂「守軍全部殉難，當地各軍事機關情形不明，」言辭仍極模糊，但迄未承認方先覺軍長以次，各師長參謀長等防守軍首腦投降之事實。</p>
<h3 id="c4">怒江方面激戰中　日軍確保各陳地　新幾內亞綫敵建小型機塲 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　緬甸戰綫，日軍自七月中旬以來，即死守密勞芝那，並在渝軍兩師，空輸部隊兩旅，美軍一旅所編成之優勢集團攻　之下，以寡敵衆，予敵損失甚大，於二日及三日兩夜，已奉命自該地自動撤退。敵軍兵力雖大，因受日軍孤兵阻遏，終不得不採取要塞攻城戰法之抗道戰，繼續苦戰，日軍自動撤退後，敵已佔領該地。怒江方面之渝軍，渡過怒江，日軍正與之激戰中，尤其拉富，騰越附近之戰　，更為猛烈，日軍現仍確保全綫各陣地，渝軍損失頗大。新幾內亞戰綫，七月三十日，在新幾內亞島頭半島西北岸登陸之敵，約三營兵力，似正着手建設小型機塲中。</p>
<h3 id="c5">渝美機又襲北九州朝鮮　日制空部隊當予擊退 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日上午七時四十分發表：八月十一日上午一時許，有巾國方面飛來之敵機二十架，分襲朝鮮南部，九州下部北部，並山陰地方，日軍防空部隊當即邀擊，迫使退去，至其戰果與日方損失，現正調查中，但可揣知損失極徵。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午五時三十分發表：關於日本於十一日晨受空襲事，據嗣後調查所得，除九州西部地方有輕微之被害外，其他地域爲盲炸，並無何等損失。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　駐渝美空軍十一日上午一時許，對朝鮮南部，北九州北部西部及山陰地方，各以數機作遊擊性之空襲。該渝美機係由成都附近起飛，共二十餘架編成數隊，侵入各地區後，日制空部隊當即邀擊，渝美機即倉惶遁去。侵北九州之渝美機，由於日本照空部隊齊放制空光，故異常狼狽，未及投彈，即從海上飛去。又九州一地所投各彈，均落於山林中曠野地帶，其他地區雖中彈若干，但僅民房數戶被炸，且因消防隊早即待勢出動，故火勢未能擴大，渝美機來襲，日方並未受何損害。駐渝美空軍由於要衝衡陽失陷，無論對渝方或美國內，均已處於不利地位，彼等爲掩飾戰敗。故不得不作此次遊擊空襲，由其來襲戰法觀之，可知全爲圖獲宣傳效果，此極爲明顯。</p>
<h3 id="c6">呼應政府步調　協力完遂戰爭　日小林總裁就任演詞 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日軍贊政治會十一日下午在該會本部舉行小林總裁推戴大會，出席者有金光代理總務會長各職員，貴眾兩院議員及各會員等六百餘名，政府方面有小磯首相及六大臣。開會後，首由金光代理總務會長報告推舉小林躋造大將經過，並介紹新總裁，繼由小林大將起立致詞，小磯首相致祝辭後，即行散會。茲誌小林總裁致詞要旨如次：目前大東亞戰爭已突入最深切之階段，敵人已迫近日本本土門戶，此時我等一億國民，唯有捨充一切雜念，發揮總力，向戰勝之途邁進。我翼贊政治會之任務，乃立於時代尖端奮鬥，以應國家之需要。新內開此次爲策定指導戰爭之根本方針，並使政戰兩回答趨於一致起見，特設置最高戰事指導會議，今後政府之施策，即由該會議決定，我翼贊政治會亦呼應政府之步調，並以最大決心，協力政府，共同完遂戰爭。</p>
<h3 id="c7">松島部長談最近戰局　敵美掩飾敗局頻施空襲 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>日本駐華艦陰報道部松島部長，於昨（十一）日午後循例會見上海中國新聞記者團，就目前戰局，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>敵美企圖</p>
<p>檢討邇來敵美作戰方法，無論來自大陸或於太平洋方面，其最後目的，似在中國大陸。據八月十日火奴魯魯美聯社電，羅斯福總統在該處連續三天與陸海空軍首腦作長時間之會談，并于會談終結後，向記者發表談話，表示美將經菲島向中國大陸進展，關於羅斯福之言論，可以美西南太平洋艦隊指揮官麥克沃塞參加會談之事實加以證明，並使吾人在判斷敵美今後作戰上獲得良好之資料。總之，敵美之野心，希望於最短時期到達中國大陸。</p>
<p>空襲騷擾</p>
<p>在華美空軍最近蠢動，日見積極。八月十一日午前一時許，由中國方面起飛之敵機二十架左右，企圖對朝鮮南部九州西部，九州北部，以及山陰一帶，施行空襲。按敵美空軍對日本本土頻施空襲，不僅爲作戰上之行動，且蘊有如何能使重慶永遠依附英美之政略陰謀。日本最近在中國大陸作戰勝利，如粵漢綫之重要據點衡陽之攻陷，使其大爲震撼，敵美爲冀圖掩飾挽回人心起見，始作此舉。當然與其說美佔領塞班，無　謂衡陽被日本攻陷對中國之影響較爲重大。敵美力圖掩飾此重大之局面起見，向日本本土施以空襲，此次美空襲日情形，因尚未掃獲詳細電報，無法明瞭，但據本人想像，甚所轟炸區域，均爲山嶽地帶影響，頗難遂其目的。葢日本與中國美國不同，舉凡都市及重工業設施，均建于峯繼起伏之間，即于白天偵察時，亦往往易于失却目標，何况在黑夜倉忙之際，欲求目標之命中，更屬緣木求魚。是故敵機即使大隊前往，亦不易達成目的，至于分散偷襲，更屬徒然。又因山嶽地帶，氣壓不同，初航在上者極不習慣，每易椅墮山麓，故依吾人推斷，美機之無謂空襲，必如前數次之勞而無功也。至其損害情形之統計，亦因干山嶽地帶關係，亦須經相當時間始克發表。</p>
<p>敵機襲滬</p>
<p>其次關於最近敵機來犯上海方面的情形，本人再略述如下：自本月七日晚間以來，美空軍迭次進犯滬市，吾人視爲敵方對「八一三」之擾亂試圖而已。本月八日清晨敵機於「康脫凡蒂」與江岸之間投彈，結果亦無若何損害。於此次空襲中，余感覺最痛快者，余深以爲無論中日均爲天佑之國，因在水面上爆炸之彈片飛得很遠，而竟無一人受傷，由是吾人更可判斷敵美航空人員技術上之拙劣，如　炸力之不強大。昨（十）晚敵機及其別動隊於中國大陸起飛，經南京上海，故滬市發出警報，但敵機並未投彈，即改變路綫，中國民眾對防空之協力，無論於燈火之管制，及交通之整理，均可謂近乎　想，尤爲本人所感激者，防空司令部爲確保市民之安全起見，發覺空襲危險，迅即發現警報，所以希望市民今後於警報發出以後，能與現在一樣，以敏捷的動作，採取充分的準備，同時對　　的防止，更希一般市民，加以注意。</p>

<p>里斯本十一日中炎社電　德國社訊：據來自權者山之報吿稱，羅斯福總統于檀香山勾留二日，其間曾與麥克沃塞將軍·尼米資海軍大將。哈爾賽海軍大將·及利希海軍大將等舉行會談，就太平洋戰爭之發展有所討論。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　蘇聯情報局九日夜發表戰報，承認德軍於東綫之總反攻，尤以阿普魯士國境一帶為最甚。據合衆社莫斯科電稱：德軍自入日來，預備軍已出動東普魯士國境，蘇軍自拉塞尼亞·維爾克·維休奇斯不及馬和安波爾西北三方面侵入東普魯士東南國境，企圖進迫遞結齊魯基特·印斯迭爾堡爾市之綫。又據美聯社記者夏比羅訊：因德軍反攻，道路全被阻塞，似已陷於苦戰狀熊，一方企圖攻取瓦西利夫斯基之蘇軍，前正自特賓斯克西北土味拿北岸之克爾斯特比爾斯至里特瓦尼亞之佐那卡濕地北端之比爾塞一帶，徐徐前進中。據美聯社訊，德軍於比少塞附近集結有力戰車部隊，於九日已展開前後達四十次之反攻，力圖粉碎蘇軍之企圖。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電德國社訊，軍息：經過數日之沉寂後，蘇軍已於日昨重行發動大規模之攻勢於華沙與奧加斯托伏之間，華沙之東，敵軍一切攻熱均被挫敗，蘇軍僅於比挨里斯托克之西北，在德軍陣地中形成數缺口，德軍旋於屢有進出之激戰中遏阻敵軍。</p>
<p>東綫南翼　壓力增重</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德國社訊：星期三東綫防禦大戰之集點，仍在巴拉諾夫區與默麥爾之北。但蘇軍不顧以往數日之失敗，似有重復對喀爾巴阡山陣地施加壓力之意，紅軍在巴拉諾夫地區亦正在增援，故紅軍顯然擬以大規模之鉛形行動，企圖粉碎德軍之南翼，同時德洪軍山地部隊繼續在喀爾巴阡山脚下進攻，並　平較鞍靼山隘迤北之深缺口一處，因而使蘇重若于集團中伏被殲。巴拉諾夫突入區，穌坦克車編隊再度排列陣綫，向南作大規模之進攻，德防禦砲火與主力機之襲擊，再度遏阻蘇軍之突破企圖。</p>

<p>伯倫十一日中央社電　德國社訊：據波蘭外交界解釋，蘇波談判之中斷與波總理米柯拉席克之返英，乃因蘇聯之要求波蘭明白表示廢棄一九三九年之英波同盟安全公約。蘇方解釋謂歐洲政治狀況之形成，乃英政府所承認之事實，因此不能容許蘇聯之任何一鄰國與第三國有政治上之協定。波總理米柯拉席克對於蘇方之要求，尙須闡明態度，米氏於星期三曾在蘇京與駐英大使寇爾會談。</p>

<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊：法國戰事益趨激烈，加拿大軍坦克車隊由飛機掩護，於前日在奧納河與狄夫河問推淮，德軍移至新陣地，藉以撙節人力與物力。加軍坦克車隊經聖錫爾文折向南面，進抵拉卡巴臬，洛森海西北加拿大軍爲德軍所阻。克恩。法萊斯公路以西之反軸心軍，激戰於奧納河與萊齊斯河合流處，德軍在奧軍在奧納河與克恩，法萊斯公路間撤退後，奧納河東岸格里姆巴斯克橋頭堡，已不能威脅德軍側面矣。加拿大軍與格里姆巴斯克之英軍會合，未測截斷大隊德軍。英第二軍在奧納河與維爾河間蒙特里康兩面，向東南進攻，進展甚徵。美軍在維爾西南及南面，繼續向德軍陣地使用壓力，塞倫斯之反軸心軍陣地已被德軍奪回。德軍於週初在西河與塞龍河間反攻，發生劇戰，美軍損失慘重，塞龍河以南伐倫納斯河與邁揚納河上洗，反軸心軍無進展。美軍向蒙城推進者繼續東進，在蒙特一福特被阻於德軍，反軸心軍在洛爾區域增加壓力。布列塔尼方面聖馬羅爭奪戰，亦已進入長激烈之階段，但戰局無變化。</p>

<h3 id="c24">英美的對渝政策　英國企圖獨佔中國市塲 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>日本軍隊在中國發動的大攻勢，使協約國對中國戰綫陷入極端悲觀的狀態，而終於暴露出敵方陣營的一大弱點，這是已經無須聱言的了。最近訪問重慶的美國副大總統華萊士，曾有過關於重慶軍力的悲觀報吿，此外美國雜誌時代等，曾屢次指摘因日本巧妙作戰，而中國戰綫失敗，因而累及美國駐華空軍，這全是表示重慶本身，以及支持重慶政權的英美，焦頭爛額之現象。同時對於日暮途窮的重慶政府，愈益展開英美間的勾心鬥角，矛盾錯綜。</p>
<p>只在戰爭這一點土說，固然不歷當低估英美對重慶的援助程度，但問題一談到戰後建設，則不可忽視敵方陣營內的明爭暗鬥，正在方興未艾。在作戰方面上說，中國的空軍是在於席諾特美國第十四空軍隊的實力之下，而緬甸北　就綫上抵抗皇軍的重慶軍，即史蒂威爾將軍指揮下的美渝聯軍，這一美國式渝軍的作戰方針，與　特巴頓指揮下的英國重隊相互對立，這是人所共知的。躱藏在遠東作戰的旗幟下，美國想壟斷前此的特殊權益，而英國則對之非常不安，這一點業已脫離中國本身問題，而日趨尖銳化。下面刋出倫敦泰晤士報所發表的近著「中國的緊急問題」一文，是英國匿名的中國通在陳述戰後對中國的指導和榨取，是表示始終不改的英國殖民地政策之貧婪，同時也是刻劃英國對美國將獨佔中國市塲的焦急。</p>
<p>英國不甘落後</p>
<p>戰爭最初時期的英國所有下的香港，新嘉　以及緬甸等處，遭受一連串的敗北，致使無數中國人的財產喪失，因而英國的紳士顏面，一洛千丈。乘英國的失敗而發財者，是美國，其主要者爲駐華空軍的設立，以及一萬萬金磅的大借欵。英國也不甘洛人後，而提出五千萬勝的借欵，但這有點過遲了。固然，這是有其相當理由的但如財政失敗，而在政治上取償，這是非常困難的，結果英國在中國問題上永遠立於美國的下風了。中國在七七事變爆發時，沃學和工塲都曾進行過丙遷工作，這一處置固屬良好，但只限於內遷，而不能發揮光天，且陷於聲嘶力竭，苟延殘喘的悲慘狀熊裏。對中國將來擁有極大利害關係的我們英國，是必須進行援華工作的。這決非是輕而易舉的工作。</p>
<p>戰後中國，將陷於國內紛爭和應擦，是人所共知的，但我們英國對於這一點，是不容漠不關心的。假如放棄這一點，而引起所謂「政治眞空」，那末中國仍將繼續前此歷史上的覆轍，而被他國所乘，結果只有割地賠欵。那種情形還會使中國陷於新的戰爭漩渦，而英國也必然被拖入這一漆黑一團裏。擁有龐大人力的中國，單獨工業化而走向整榮，道件事情的本身，也將發生危險，所以無論如何，都非有先進工業國作有效幫助不可。十九世紀中國，曾經是歐美各國爭權奪利的塲所。後來曾受到日本和俄國的威脅，從而產生共產黨的搗亂。又加政治不上軌道，於是兵連禍結，飢饉貧困相織而來。解決這種問題的最好辦法，就是英美共同合作，發展中國的工業和農業。然則英國對於將來中國，應當採取什麼熊度呢？一直到數年前，英國對華輸出，在鐵鑛，機械，纖維製品方面，曾佔絕對優勢。由於後來日本及德國出現於中國市塲，於是英國便一落而降爲第四位。</p>
<p>例如一九三二年我們英國的鋼軌對華輪出，會佔全額的三分之二·但因七七事變一落而降爲四分之一。發電機的貿易，被德國及瑞士搶去大半。此外關於機械製品，我們英國對華輸出，是由百分之五十二降爲百分之十三，日本則正相反，而由百分之十八激增至百分之八十一。</p>
<p>恢復中國市塲</p>
<p>戰後我們英國，無論如何都必須恢復這樣的中國市塲。我們對於佔世界總人口四分之一的中國市塲，絕對不能置之不理的。開發中國的工業和農業，如不按計劃，則只有惹起新的戰爭。但這一開發，決不能委諸美國一國之手</p>
<p>詳知中國的英國人，有一種充分的確信，認爲能解決現在中國的困難，和能恢復中國人的信仰。那末爲達此目的，怎樣作呢？中國人月前所渴望者，是中國的工業任。他們知道如無工業，而想提高生活程度是不可能的。他們雖想成爲西歐各國以及日本那樣工業國家，但苦無辦法。關於工業資源，拿中國來和美國和蘇聯比較，固然有勉强的地方，但比較日本，却是豐當多多。即是這樣，日本仍然是工業輸出國。由此觀之，中國的工業化，並不是絕到不可能的。經濟方面和技術方面的指導，在且前是遠比財政援助爲重耍。但從各方面來看，開發巾國如無英國幫忙，是無成功希望的。在這種關係上，英國應當首先派遺經濟及技術尃門家。在英淪兩政府問，主要先應當締結經濟合作的金融協定。然後再派各種專門的工業家。與中國實際合作，應當是我們政策的主洗。為指導中國，首先必須取得中國的信任。在這一點上，我們必須承認戰後中國為領土完整的獨立國，而不應要求任何特殊權益。（安譯自七月二十六日每日新聞瑞典通訊）</p>

<p>「那末佐久間上尉曾站過的地方呢？」</p>
<p>隆夫從中央的發令台上看司令塔。這正如從下面看體水管一樣。在人體不易通過的狹仄圓管中，兩脚踏進去，覺着非常不舒服，上　常常指揮，且在蒙雖時所在的地方，就是寫那封遺囑的所在。在圓管的墻上，用白色書着A的記號。</p>
<p>從A到N的十四個英文字姆，表示着十四個艇員的遺體所在地。正像I上校所說，大家都各自在自已的崗位上死去的。遠　一等水兵，一直到死拚命使用的手壓抽水機，也極然在原地保留着,　這樣記號，在黑暗中稍微透出白色來、</p>
<p>眞人雖然業已來過五六次了，但角然是空頭佇立着。此時無聲的靜寂，使人想像沈沒海底以及人業已死後的該　的狀況。軍人的　　正氣，一直保　到最後的人們的安眠，似乎仍然在這艘艇中還存在着。</p>
<p>參觀完畢，就是跑出來，隆夫仍然肅然起敬的一句話也講不出來。從此處稍微走了幾步，將定上水交針山坡時，而從另外相反的道上跑來一位下士官。帶着二等兵　的紅　　。望過去，這位兵曹筆挺地站着，在行正確的敎禮，而開始與價人講話。似乎說重要事件，而費的時間相當長</p>
<p>「那個　伙是我的部下，年齡雖然比我大三歲，但完全像我的弟弟一樣，眞是令人喜歡的一個人。」</p>
<p>在永交社會堂，吃最　的午飯詩，眞人這樣說。在這樣語調中，滲透着　蓬勃勃的咸）情，但隆夫並未注意及此，只是左顧右盼地看撲素食堂。在東城書家的書中曾看過東京的水交號，但此處並不像那　富　　皇，然而卻有親熱的感覺</p>
<p>宿願（一）</p>
<p>隆夫決定坐當天晚上的火車，離別吳鎭了。這是因爲眞人說太忙，恐怕住到星期一，要麻煩他。</p>
<p>「假設冋來路過時，不再來一趟麽？假如有好機會，我願讓你參觀一下軍港。或許讓你坐一次軍艦。」</p>
<p>到車站來送行的軍人，覺着很難過而這樣說</p>
<p>「謝謝！同來路過時一定還來。但此次眞令我感激不盡。」</p>
<p>隆夫在車上，頭探出窗外，這樣非常感激地說了開車的汽笛一鳴，眞人便不知不覺說出大話來，而凝視着隆夫：</p>
<p>「好了，你努力奮鬥吧！我也拼命幹。」</p>
<p>眞人輕輕把手舉到軍帽邊行軍禮時，這種姿態使隆夫受到無限的感觸，無論如何，一句話也說不出來。兩個相互結成的視綫，像天空中的虹一樣，一直等到在天空中消逝，隆夫才不繼續注視親友的面孔了。不大的工夫，眞人似乎很決斷，又施一禮後，即先出東站了。</p>
<p>在廣島換夜車時，隆夫在心坎上仍然還想念偽人。但他因為非常滿足，所以就不能留戀吳　的兩日逗留，</p>
<p>（偽人成為偉大的軍人了。而且在「福田」碰到的士官們，也都是令人暢快的人們。）</p>
<p>那種空氣，對於隆夫說，眞像得大獨厚，他固然住在裏國的資格是沒有的，但他願意感觸，願意　騐，只是希望在畫中一樣，這他就滿足了（即單純就瞭解了潛水艇精神說，收獲也够大的了……）</p>
<p>隆夫這標想着，而曚曚地睡去了。</p>
<p>到下關的時候，已經晨光　微了。為了坐去　兒島的快車，而有充分時間，消遙自在地渡過下關門司，去吃早飯。</p>
<p>一踏上九州的土地，隆夫不禁發生了無限感慨。自從由家中出走以來，終於不得不回家了，演種心境，在心坎上不斷跳動着。然而得到海軍大臣賞，這一點能安慰父母到何種程度，是無法知道的。</p>
<p>火車一過川內，心海中立刻起了絕大的波浪。看見櫻島的時候，眼眶中含着熱淚了。三時剛過就到了　兒島，　出乎意外，枝妹竟到車站來迎接了。（一三〇）</p>

<h3 id="c47">掉換居住證　改善手續問題 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>此次保甲常局掉換市民證爲居住證，爲體　民艱，准許利用奮證照片，其用意之善，殊可歌頌。並聞對於市民且領居住證之手續，亦力謀簡單，以便小民，尤可爲市政前途慶幸。然查常熟區方面，關於領取居住澄之手續，則繁複異常，爲戶長者，在此尙未領得之前，己有跑痛脚筋之苦，保甲辦事處方面之留難情形，拘泥形式，可謂無以復加。</p>
<p>最顯然者，如申請人之名下必須加蓋圖章，雖兒童傭婦老嫗，亦須補蓋，結果市民所耗金錢與時間不貲，實有違當局簡易便民之旨。且聲請書上旣將蓋印本人指膜，則圖章一事實為點綴形式而已，似宜酌予從寬。此外照片每人兩張，似亦可允許變通利用舊片，以節吾小民開支，另聞領取居住證，由塡具申請書尙係第一步手續，竟以不願小民困苦至此，將來如蓋指膜，以及正式請領，聞其手續尙多麻煩。似有亟加注意改善之必要。（虹）</p>
<h3 id="c48">申請居住證的幾個問題 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>自去年八月一日收回租界之後，對於一八二區要調換居住證的事情，早屬我們所意料。因爲在非常時期內，所以在過去幾週，當局和聯保方面開了數次會，原因是咸少申請人的困難及一切無謂的良費，可是理論固屬理論，個意外的問題，使許多申請人只感到是無意義，太局和聯保方面來鄭重的討論一下。</p>
<p>申請人的圖章問題</p>
<p>在一張申謂居住證紙上，除了要有甲長和戶長的印鑑外，再要有申請人的手印和印鑑，手印當然不會發生問題，至　印鑒就不能個個　辦了，因爲申請人不一定都有圖章，尤其如一般婦女？剛滿需要居住證年齡的小孩和替人家服務的女傭和車夫等人，又在婦女們大都用「××氏」來代替姓名，如果他們和她們都費了錢爲了這一次無意義的需要而刻了一個以後再無他用的圓章，如此的消費可謂太浪費了，因爲要一防止舞弊和　領居住證的不在於圖章，面注重於手印，再者這個消費的數目也可相當驚人，在戰詩應節約物貨的　在，還可如此浪費嗎？</p>
<p>捺手印問題</p>
<p>申請紙上的手印，據說要到警察局當面去捺的，如比，困難又發生了，因爲耍條手印的那天，如果恰有人因生病或有意外不能親自參加，假使是在家襄先捺畢再交甲長，就不會發生如此困難，在領居住證的時候，我認爲也不必讓許多申請人都擁到警察局或聯保辦事處的門口，而可把居住證由每甲長挨戶分給各申請人。賢明的富局和聯保方面當也能諒　申請人的苦衷。</p>
<p>南市的敲詐問題</p>
<p>據南市居民談，聯保方面强迫申請人購買「居住證壳十」，若有違者扣留居住證，這種敲詐恐嚇手段，也希望賢明的當局和聯保方面加以取締。</p>
<p>最後，我熱盼着賢明的富局和聯保方面立即降下「甘霖，」道不但是我人之幸，也是全上海申請人之幸。（頑石）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: On the European War Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Question: Regarding the European war situation, external rumors are diverse and opinions vary. Could you please explain the overall situation?</p>
<p>Answer: The resolution of the Tehran Conference to attack Germany from the east, west, and south has been realized due to the British and American invasion of northern France, the northward advance of British and American forces in Italy, and the start of the Soviet summer counteroffensive on the Eastern Front. However, the military developments of the past two months have been uneven. The British and American operations in northern France and Italy have been extremely slow, while the Soviet activities on the Eastern Front have been more noteworthy. When discussing the European situation, one must first consider this characteristic.</p>
<p>Question: So, what is the situation on the Northern France front?</p>
<p>Answer: The British and American forces landed in northern France two months ago and have occupied an area of only 25,000 square kilometers. The deepest penetration is only 30 to 50 kilometers from the coastline and 1,000 kilometers from Berlin. In this narrow area, a force of up to five million has been concentrated, resulting in extremely heavy losses. In the eight weeks after the landing alone, they have lost 2,100 tanks, 2,000 aircraft, over 30 warships, 60 transport ships totaling about 300,000 tons, and ground forces losses of about 200,000! Now the British and Americans have had to change their strategy, shifting to the Le Havre area in the south, attempting to converge on Paris along the Rouen-Paris route. The longer the front, the more difficult the supply. It is no wonder that the progress of more than sixty days has not exceeded one hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation in the Italian theater?</p>
<p>Answer: The progress of the anti-Axis forces on the Southern Front is even slower. Since invading Rome, despite desperate and risky northward advances, they have been blocked along the Arno River. The famous cultural city of Florence was even abandoned by the German forces to preserve its historical culture. So, in the past forty days, the British and American forces can be said to have made little progress. Although there was news yesterday of a new landing in the Gulf of Genoa, from a geographical point of view, the coast there is mostly mountainous, making it difficult to deploy tank battles. The result will only be to increase the consumption of the anti-Axis forces. The main purpose of the Axis powers in the Italian theater was originally to contain and consume the enemy forces!</p>
<p>Question: What is the truth about the Eastern Front?</p>
<p>Answer: Starting on the third anniversary of the German-Soviet War (June 22), the Soviet army launched an offensive from Belarus and Ukraine with four corps of more than one million troops. Its front gradually expanded in a fan shape. Now, from Narva on the Estonian border in the north to Lviv (Lemberg), a key point in southern former Poland, the front is more than 1,200 kilometers long. The Soviet army has broken through the 1939 German-Soviet demarcation line, occupied Lublin, crossed the Vistula River by force, and is attempting to directly attack Warsaw. In the north, they are advancing fiercely from the three Baltic coastal states, attempting to break through the border of East Prussia; in the south, from Lviv to the Carpathian Mountains, they are eyeing the Hungarian, Czech, and Romanian border areas. The situation is quite serious. However, since the German forces on the Eastern Front unanimously switched to the offensive a few days ago, the Soviet forces on all fronts have been forced to halt or retreat.</p>
<p>Question: From a global perspective of Europe, what is the future trend?</p>
<p>Answer: The focus of the current war situation will be the great battle to defend Paris in the West. However, the anti-Axis forces' actions on that side are slow and supplies are difficult. The German forces can rest and wait for the enemy and then annihilate them. The focus of the Eastern Front will be the great battle in the central plains of former Poland, but the war situation will not be determined by Warsaw alone, but will depend on who controls the Vistula River. Its future deserves close attention. However, we can conclude that the German army will definitely be able to seize the initiative. First, since the failure of the attempted rebellion, German morale has been high, and manpower has entered a new stage. Their reserve strength must not be underestimated. Second, time is a victory factor in the decisive battle, and Germany undoubtedly wants to be the master of time. The deeper the enemy penetrates, the more difficult their supply and communication will be, while Germany will find it more convenient. Third, the anti-Axis powers have disunified command, divergent strategic goals, and the more the military progresses, the sharper the political contradictions become. Conversely, the more the war situation progresses, the stronger Germany's unity becomes!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Adapts to the Decisive Battle Situation and Implements National Total Armament; Concrete Measures Will Be Formally Approved by the Cabinet <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the decisive battle situation and establish and implement important defense measures, the Japanese government recently decided at a cabinet meeting to implement national total armament to make it concrete. This time, Interior Minister Ōdachi made an important statement at the cabinet meeting on the 11th to rapidly strengthen the domestic security posture. It is said that in order to respond to the military defense posture, the Japanese government should prepare various domestic systems and adapt to the decisive battle situation. A domestic total armament deployment should be implemented in related labor, production, transportation, communication, propaganda, food, welfare, and the general public. Regarding its specific plan, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Education, and the Information Bureau are currently reviewing and carefully studying it. Minister Ōdachi's re-submission of this plan at the cabinet meeting shows the Japanese government's concern on this point. Furthermore, the implementation methods of this specific plan will be formally approved at the cabinet meeting on the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday the War Results Obtained in the Capture of Hengyang; Many Chongqing Army Generals and Soldiers Surrendered <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - At 3:30 PM on the 11th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the war results obtained by the Japanese army when Hengyang fell. The main points that have been clarified so far are as follows: (1) Captured the 10th Army Commander Fang Xianjue, as well as the army's Chief of Staff, the Commander of the 190th Division, the Commander of the New 10th Provisional 54th Division, and 23,300 others. (2) Captured 101 various artillery pieces, and a large amount of heavy and light machine gun ammunition.</p>
<p>Entering a New Stage in the War Against China</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The brilliant war results of the Japanese army's occupation of Hengyang City were announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 11th. Since June 28, the Japanese army gradually took a surrounding posture against Hengyang, and on the one hand, launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Chongqing country's reinforcement army gathered everywhere on the east and west banks of the Xiangjiang River, and on the other hand, prepared the attack posture. Finally, in four and a half days, Hengyang, which was firmly defended by the Chongqing army, was occupied by the Japanese army. Under the command of Army Commander Fang Xianjue, Hengyang City had a total force of about four divisions, and under the guidance and assistance of American advisors, relying on its excellent equipment and solid defensive facilities, it repeatedly stubbornly resisted. Finally, it could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks, and most of it was annihilated by the Japanese army. The remaining half, led by the army commander, chief of staff, and division commanders, totaling about 13,300, surrendered to Japan with their weapons. The captured weapons were 101 artillery pieces, 520 light and heavy machine guns, about 3,500 rifles, and a large amount of other ammunition and equipment. The excellent equipment of the surrendered Chongqing army was rare among the Chongqing army, and with the supervision of the American army and Chiang Kai-shek's strict orders, their fighting spirit was extremely strong. According to the prisoners, Chiang Kai-shek had awarded a commendation on July 26 to encourage the defense of Hengyang, and spared no effort to train the soldiers' fighting spirit in various ways, but in the end, they could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks. The capture of the solid stronghold by the Japanese army is undoubtedly a major blow to the Chongqing-US coalition forces' continental strategy against Japan. The distance from Chongqing to Kitakyushu is equivalent to that from Saipan to Kitakyushu. If the Japanese army loses its leading offensive on the continental front in the future, the Japanese mainland will suffer fierce counterattacks from Nimitz from the Pacific Ocean, and at the same time, it will still suffer fierce counterattacks from the Chongqing-US coalition forces on the continental side. In this way, the strategic posture of the Japanese army will suffer more difficulties than now, which is not difficult to imagine. The more severe the Pacific war situation becomes, the more the path to victory for the Japanese army on the Chinese front expands. Looking at the current war situation, we can see the great importance of Japan's capture of Hengyang. In fact, since the Japanese army controlled Hengyang, the forward base of the Chongqing-US air force for attacking the Japanese mainland and attacking Japan's maritime transportation routes in the Greater East Asia area has been paralyzed. At the same time, Guilin and other bases in the area west of the Yuehan Railway have also been placed under the control of Japanese aircraft. Now the US air force stationed in Chongqing has retreated to the northwest area to carry out strategic guerrilla air raids against Manchuria, Korea, and the Kitakyushu area. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang, the war situation on the Chinese front has taken a new turn, and the Chongqing army has almost no morale after the loss of its key city, Hengyang. Moreover, the Japanese army does not fight according to the "three principles of not killing, not burning, and not looting," so the people along the front line in Hunan are happy to return, which from a side view, is actually helpful to the progress of the war.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army Suffers Disintegration and Loses Fighting Spirit</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Hengyang City completely lost its fighting spirit after being besieged and attacked by the Japanese army until the Japanese army broke into the city center. On the morning of the 8th, Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chongqing army, Chief of Staff Sun Mingyu, Commander of the 3rd Division Zhou Qingxiang, Commander of the 190th Division Rong Youlüe, Acting Commander of the Reserve 10th Division Li Bafu, and Commander of the 524th Division Rao Shaowei, the highest commanders of the Chongqing army in Hengyang, finally joined the ranks of the surrendered soldiers and raised the white flag to surrender. The brief biographies of the Chongqing army generals are as follows: (1) Fang Xianjue, Commander of the 10th Army, courtesy name Zishan, from Suqian, Jiangsu Province, graduated from the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1931, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the 10th Division of the 10th Army. In 1940, he was promoted to Commander of the division. In 1942, he was promoted to Commander of the 10th Army. When the war began this time, he was appointed as the person directly responsible for defending Hengyang.

<p>Central News Agency News - The Chongqing military authorities only attempted to cover up the news of the fall of Hengyang with vague statements such as "communication with the front has been cut off and the situation is unclear." On the night of the 10th, the Chongqing Military Affairs Committee issued a communique, finally admitting that Hengyang had fallen and stating that the city had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army on the 8th. The announcement also mentioned the Hengyang garrison, saying that "the entire garrison was martyred, and the situation of the local military agencies is unclear," but still did not admit the fact that Army Commander Fang Xianjue and other division commanders and chiefs of staff, the heads of the defending army, had surrendered.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fierce Fighting on the Nu River Front; Japanese Army Secures All Positions; Enemy Builds Small Airfield on New Guinea Line <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - On the Burma front, the Japanese army has been defending Myitkyina since mid-July, and under the attack of a superior group composed of two Chongqing army divisions, two air-transported brigades, and one US army brigade, it fought against the majority with the few, inflicting great losses on the enemy. On the nights of the 2nd and 3rd, it was ordered to withdraw from the area voluntarily. Although the enemy's forces were large, they were deterred by the Japanese army's lone troops and had no choice but to adopt the siege warfare tactics and continue to fight hard. After the Japanese army's voluntary withdrawal, the enemy occupied the area. On the Nu River front, the Chongqing army crossed the Nu River, and the Japanese army is fighting fiercely with them. Especially the battles near Laifu and Tengchong are even more intense. The Japanese army is still securing all positions along the entire line, and the Chongqing army has suffered considerable losses. On the New Guinea front, the enemy, which landed on the northwest coast of the Bird's Head Peninsula on New Guinea Island on July 30 with approximately three battalions, seems to be starting to build a small airfield.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chongqing-US Aircraft Again Attack Kitakyushu, Korea; Japanese Air Defense Forces Repel Them <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:40 AM on the 11th: At approximately 1:00 AM on August 11, approximately 20 enemy aircraft flying from the China area attacked southern Korea, lower northern Kyushu, and the Sanin region. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted and forced them to retreat. The war results and Japanese losses are currently under investigation, but it can be inferred that the losses are extremely minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 11th: Regarding the air raid on Japan on the morning of the 11th, according to subsequent investigations, apart from minor damage in the western part of Kyushu, other areas were blind bombing and there were no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - At approximately 1:00 AM on the 11th, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing launched a guerrilla-style air raid on southern Korea, northern and western Kitakyushu, and the Sanin region with several aircraft each. The Chongqing-US aircraft took off from near Chengdu, and were formed into several teams of over 20 aircraft to invade the various regions. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them, and the Chongqing-US aircraft fled in panic. The Chongqing-US aircraft that invaded Kitakyushu were in extreme disarray due to the Japanese air defense forces' all-out barrage of air defense lights, and fled from the sea without dropping their bombs. Furthermore, the bombs dropped in Kyushu all landed in mountainous forests and wilderness areas. Although some shells hit in other areas, only a few civilian houses were bombed, and because the fire brigade was ready to move out early, the fire was not able to spread. The Japanese side did not suffer any damage from the Chongqing-US aircraft's attack. Due to the loss of the key point Hengyang, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is in an unfavorable position, both for Chongqing and within the United States. In order to cover up the defeat, they had no choice but to carry out this guerrilla-style air raid. From the way they launched the attack, it can be seen that it was all intended to achieve publicity effects, which is extremely obvious.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Minister Matsushima Discusses Recent War Situation; Enemy America Conceals Defeats and Frequently Launches Air Raids <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Embassy in China's Press Department met with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Group as usual yesterday (11th) afternoon, and gave the following speech on the current war situation:</p>
<p>Enemy America's Intentions</p>
<p>Examining the recent operational methods of Enemy America, whether from the mainland or in the Pacific, its ultimate goal seems to be the Chinese mainland. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Honolulu on August 10, President Roosevelt held long meetings with the heads of the army, navy, and air force there for three consecutive days, and after the meetings ended, he gave a speech to reporters, stating that the United States will advance to the Chinese mainland via the Philippines. Roosevelt's remarks can be confirmed by the fact that Admiral MacArthur, commander of the US Southwest Pacific Fleet, participated in the meetings, providing us with good information for judging Enemy America's future operations. In short, Enemy America's ambition is to reach the Chinese mainland in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Air Raids and Harassment</p>
<p>The US Air Force in China has recently been increasingly active. At approximately 1:00 AM on August 11, approximately 20 enemy aircraft took off from the China area, attempting to launch air raids on southern Korea, western Kyushu, northern Kyushu, and the Sanin region. The frequent air raids by Enemy America's air force on the Japanese mainland are not only operational actions, but also contain a political conspiracy to ensure that Chongqing will forever be attached to Britain and America. Japan's recent victories in operations on the Chinese mainland, such as the capture of Hengyang, an important stronghold on the Yuehan Line, have greatly shaken them. Enemy America is doing this in order to try to cover up and win back people's hearts. Of course, the impact on China of Japan capturing Hengyang is more significant than America occupying Saipan. In order to cover up this significant situation, Enemy America is launching air raids on the Japanese mainland. Because detailed telegrams have not yet been obtained, I am unable to clarify the situation of the US air raids on Japan this time, but according to my imagination, it will be difficult to achieve their goals because the bombed areas are mostly mountainous areas. Japan is different from China and the United States. All cities and heavy industrial facilities are built among successive peaks. Even during daytime reconnaissance, it is often easy to lose the target, let alone hitting the target in the haste of the dark night. Therefore, even if a large team of enemy aircraft goes, it is not easy to achieve the goal. As for scattered sneak attacks, they are even more futile. Also, because the air pressure in mountainous areas is different, those flying at high altitudes are extremely unaccustomed and often easily crash on the mountainside. Therefore, according to our deduction, the US aircraft's meaningless air raids will inevitably be as futile as the previous ones. As for the statistics of the damage situation, because of the mountainous terrain, it will also take a considerable amount of time to be announced.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai</p>
<p>Next, regarding the recent situation of enemy aircraft attacking Shanghai, I will briefly describe it as follows: Since the evening of the 7th of this month, the US Air Force has repeatedly invaded Shanghai. We regard this as the enemy's attempt to disrupt the "August 13th" incident. On the morning of the 8th, enemy aircraft dropped bombs between the "Conte Verde" and the riverbank, and as a result, there was no damage. During this air raid, the thing I felt most delighted about was that I deeply believe that both China and Japan are countries blessed by heaven. The shrapnel that exploded on the water surface flew very far, but no one was injured. From this, we can further judge the US aviation personnel's clumsiness in technology, such as the lack of strength of the explosives. Last night (10th), enemy aircraft and their separate detachments took off from the Chinese mainland and passed through Nanjing and Shanghai, so an alert was issued in Shanghai. However, the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs and changed their routes. The cooperation of the Chinese people in air defense, whether in the control of lights or in the management of traffic, can be said to be close to ideal, and I am especially grateful for it. In order to ensure the safety of the citizens, the air defense headquarters discovered the danger of an air raid and quickly issued an alert. Therefore, I hope that the citizens will, in the future, take full preparations with the same agility as they do now after the alert is issued, and at the same time, the general public should pay more attention to the prevention of fires.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Germany's New Measures to Promote Total War <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: In order to promote efforts for total war, Propaganda Minister Goebbels has announced six new measures: All foreign domestic servants will be transferred to heavy industrial service. Some German domestic servants will be assigned to military factories, and some will be assigned to serve families with many children. Those who were previously exempt from military service in public institutions will also be drafted into military service. If these people are already working in military factories, they will also be drafted into military service once replacements are available. Those who currently have few opportunities to participate in total war will have their rear service expanded so that they can be utilized by the armaments industry without having to perform forced labor. Women over the age of 50, for example, may also be hired to engage in this so-called rear service. Cultural undertakings will be reduced. Various methods have already been implemented. In the coming days, all young actors and film actors will be transferred to military service. Reductions in railway, postal, and cultural undertakings will be implemented. The methods will be announced to the public before implementation. Public life should be based on the needs of total war. Anything unrelated to promoting total war, such as public receptions, festival celebrations, theater weeks, concerts, exhibitions, etc., will be abolished. Official documents here indicate that since the authorities announced raising the maximum age for women to work to 50 and promulgated the law on "pretended work," the manpower needed for the armaments industry has greatly increased. The measures taken this time will inevitably greatly tighten public life, and personal life will inevitably become more war-oriented. All activities that do not conform to the principles of total war will be completely canceled in the future. The German people will concentrate all their strength with the greatest determination to continue to fight for the survival of the nation until final victory is achieved.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, November 10th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report on the night of the 9th, acknowledging the German army's general counteroffensive on the Eastern Front, especially in the vicinity of the East Prussian border. According to the United Press Moscow report: Since entering the territory, the German army's reserve forces have mobilized on the East Prussian border. Soviet troops have invaded the southeastern border of East Prussia from three directions: Raseniai, Virbalis, Vyschki, and northwest of Ambol, attempting to advance on the line of Didkiemis, Insterburg. According to Associated Press reporter Shapiro: Due to the German counteroffensive, the roads have been completely blocked, and they seem to be in a difficult fighting situation. The Soviet troops attempting to capture Vasilyevka are advancing slowly from the area northwest of Trebbin, north of the Tauvena River, from Kersterbirs to Birsai, north of the Zonnakai wetlands in Lithuania. According to the Associated Press, the German army has concentrated powerful tank units near Birsai and launched up to forty counteroffensives on the 9th, attempting to crush the Soviet army's attempt.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: Military News: After several days of silence, the Soviet army relaunched a large-scale offensive yesterday between Warsaw and Augustów. East of Warsaw, all enemy offensives were defeated. The Soviet army only formed several gaps in the German defense line northwest of Białystok. The German army then contained the enemy troops in repeated and intense battles.</p>
<p>Southern Wing of the Eastern Front Pressure Increases</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: On Wednesday, the focal points of the defensive battles on the Eastern Front remained in the Baranów district and north of Memel. However, regardless of the failures of the past few days, the Soviet army seems to intend to repeat its pressure on the Carpathian Mountain positions. The Red Army is also reinforcing in the Baranów area, so it is clear that the Red Army intends to use a large-scale pincer movement to crush the southern wing of the German army. At the same time, German and Hungarian mountain troops continue to attack at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains and level a deep gap north of the 鞍靼 pass, thereby causing Soviet troops to be ambushed and annihilated in groups. In the Baranów breakthrough area, Soviet tank formations have reorganized their lines and launched large-scale attacks southward. German defensive fire and attacks by main aircraft have once again contained the Soviet army's attempt to break through.</p>

<p>Bern, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: According to Polish diplomatic circles, the suspension of Soviet-Polish negotiations and the return of Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk to England are due to the Soviet Union's demand that Poland clearly express its abandonment of the 1939 Anglo-Polish alliance security pact. The Soviet side explained that the formation of the European political situation is a fact recognized by the British government, and therefore cannot allow any neighboring country of the Soviet Union to have a political agreement with a third country. Prime Minister Mikołajczyk still needs to clarify his attitude towards the Soviet side's demands. Mr. Mikołajczyk met with Ambassador to England Cour on Wednesday in Moscow.</p>
<p>Also, Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk left Moscow by plane on Thursday to return to London.</p>

<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency reports: The war in France is becoming increasingly fierce. Canadian tank units, supported by aircraft, advanced on the area between the Odon and Dives rivers yesterday. German troops moved to new positions to conserve manpower and resources. The Canadian tank units turned south through Saint-Sylvain and advanced to La Cabanie. Northwest of Losange, the Canadian army was blocked by German troops. The anti-Axis forces west of the Caen-Falaise highway fought fiercely at the confluence of the Odon and Laize rivers. After the German army withdrew between the Odon River and the Caen-Falaise highway, the Grimbosq bridgehead on the east bank of the Odon River can no longer threaten the German flank. The Canadian army joined up with the British army in Grimbosq, failing to cut off large German units. The British Second Army launched a southeastern offensive on both sides of Mont Pincon between the Odon and Vire rivers, making little progress. American troops southwest and south of Vire continued to apply pressure to the German positions. The anti-Axis positions in Cérisy-la-Forêt have been retaken by the German army. There was fierce fighting between the Seulles River and the Seron River at the beginning of the week, and the American army suffered heavy losses. South of the Seron River, on the Varenne and Mayenne rivers, the anti-Axis forces made no progress. American troops advancing towards Mont-Saint-Jean continue to advance eastward but were blocked by German troops in Montfort. The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure in the Loire region.

<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence movement, marked the second anniversary of the "Quit India" resolution on the 8th of this month by proposing to his Congress Party comrades that they carry out a "symbolic demonstration." At the same time, he met with an American reporter and spoke as follows: If the British government can accept the Indian independence demands I have announced this time, then the so-called freedom of the anti-Axis camp will be seen in reality. Although the anti-Axis camp has repeatedly issued declarations on democracy and freedom, if they only know how to exploit various ethnic groups, they will completely lose their true meaning. Propaganda alone cannot satisfy the various ethnic groups.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Anglo-American Policies Towards Chongqing: Britain Attempts to Monopolize the Chinese Market <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The large-scale offensive launched by the Japanese army in China has plunged the Allied nations into extreme pessimism regarding the Chinese front. This has ultimately exposed a major weakness within the enemy camp, which is already undeniable. Wallace, the U.S. Vice President, recently visited Chongqing and gave a pessimistic report on Chongqing's military strength. Furthermore, American magazines such as Time have repeatedly pointed out that the failure of the Chinese front due to Japan's skillful operations has affected the U.S. Air Force stationed in China. All of this indicates the predicament of Chongqing itself, as well as the Anglo-American support for the Chongqing regime. At the same time, Anglo-American infighting is intensifying against the backdrop of the beleaguered Chongqing government, leading to complex and intertwined conflicts.</p>
<p>While it is inappropriate to underestimate the extent of Anglo-American aid to Chongqing solely from a wartime perspective, it is impossible to ignore the fierce competition within the enemy camp, which is gaining momentum when discussing post-war reconstruction. In terms of combat, the Chinese Air Force is under the strength of Chennault’s U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, while the Chongqing army resisting the Imperial Army on the Northern Burma front is the U.S.-Chongqing Allied Force under the command of General Stilwell. This American-style Chongqing army's operational policy is opposed to the British heavy troops under the command of Mountbatten. This is well known. Hiding under the banner of Far East operations, the United States seeks to monopolize previous special rights and interests, which makes Britain feel very uneasy. This point has already moved beyond the issue of China itself and is becoming increasingly acute. The following article, "China's Urgent Problems," published in the London Times, is written by an anonymous British China expert who describes post-war guidance and exploitation of China, reflecting the unchanged greed of British colonial policy and portraying Britain's anxiety about the United States monopolizing the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Britain Refuses to Lag Behind</p>
<p>In the early stages of the war, British-owned Hong Kong, Singapore, and Burma suffered a series of defeats, resulting in the loss of countless Chinese assets and a severe blow to the reputation of British gentlemen. The one who prospered from Britain's failure was the United States, mainly through the establishment of the Air Force stationed in China and a loan of 100 million pounds. Britain was unwilling to lag behind and offered a loan of 50 million pounds, but this was somewhat late. Of course, there is a good reason for this, but if financial losses are compensated for politically, it will be very difficult. As a result, Britain will always be at a disadvantage to the United States on the issue of China. When the July 7th Incident broke out, universities and factories in China underwent a relocation effort. This arrangement was indeed good, but it was limited to internal relocation and could not unleash its full potential, leading to a tragic state of exhaustion. We, Britain, who have a great stake in the future of China, must carry out aid work. This is by no means an easy task.</p>
<p>It is well known that post-war China will fall into domestic strife and conflicts, but we in Britain cannot be indifferent to this. If we abandon this point, it will lead to a so-called "political vacuum," and China will continue the mistakes of its past history and be taken advantage of by other countries, resulting in territorial concessions and indemnities. That situation would also plunge China into a new vortex of war, and Britain would inevitably be dragged into this dark mess. It would be dangerous for China, with its vast manpower, to industrialize and prosper alone. Therefore, in any case, effective assistance from advanced industrial countries is indispensable. In the nineteenth century, China was a battleground for European and American powers. Later, it was threatened by Japan and Russia, which led to the disruption of the Communist Party. Coupled with political instability, wars, famine, and poverty became intertwined. The best way to solve this problem is for Britain and the United States to cooperate in developing China's industry and agriculture. However, what attitude should Britain take towards the future of China? Until a few years ago, Britain's exports to China, in terms of iron ore, machinery, and textile products, had an absolute advantage. Due to the later appearance of Japan and Germany in the Chinese market, Britain fell to fourth place.</p>
<p>For example, in 1932, our British steel rails accounted for two-thirds of the total amount imported by China. However, after the July 7th Incident, it fell to one-quarter. The trade in generators was mostly taken over by Germany and Switzerland. In addition, regarding machinery products, our British exports to China fell from 52 percent to 13 percent, while Japan's, on the contrary, increased sharply from 18 percent to 81 percent.</p>
<p>Restoring the Chinese Market</p>
<p>After the war, we in Britain must restore such a Chinese market at all costs. We must never ignore the Chinese market, which accounts for a quarter of the world's total population. Developing China's industry and agriculture without a plan will only provoke new wars. But this development must not be entrusted to the United States alone.</p>
<p>The British people, who are familiar with China, have full confidence that they can solve the current difficulties of China and restore the faith of the Chinese people. So how to achieve this goal? What the Chinese have been longing for is China's industrialization. They know that without industry, it is impossible to improve their living standards. Although they want to become industrial countries like Western European countries and Japan, they have no way to do it. Comparing China with the United States and the Soviet Union in terms of industrial resources may be a stretch, but compared to Japan, it is much more abundant. Even so, Japan is still an industrial exporting country. From this point of view, China's industrialization is not absolutely impossible. Economic and technical guidance is more important than financial assistance at present. But from all aspects, developing China without British help has no hope of success. In this regard, Britain should first send economic and technical experts. The main thing between the British and Chinese governments should be to conclude a financial agreement for economic cooperation. Then send various specialized industrialists. Practical cooperation with China should be the main theme of our policy. To guide China, we must first gain China's trust. On this point, we must recognize post-war China as an independent country with territorial integrity and not demand any special rights and interests.

<h3 id="e26">Police Bureau Implements Special Alert from Yesterday: Preventing Unlawful Traitors from Stirring Up Trouble <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent unlawful individuals from stirring up trouble and disrupting local public security, the city's police bureau implemented a special alert starting at 6:00 AM yesterday (11th). The police defense department ordered all branch bureaus to work shifts all night. Patrol teams were added to patrol quiet streets and lanes in their respective jurisdictions, and traffic arteries. Station police and policewomen were added to search suspicious persons and check residence permits. The entire police general team and police security team were dispatched to patrol various districts, especially to strengthen prevention and defense at entertainment venues, factories, and groups. This special alert will be lifted at 12:00 PM on the 15th.</p>
<p>Administrative Section Chief Conference</p>
<p>The city's police bureau's administrative section, due to the fact that the administrative section of each branch bureau under the jurisdiction of the former Second Police Bureau has not yet perfected the handling of police administrative affairs, specially convened a conference of the administrative section chiefs of each branch bureau in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the suburbs at the police club of the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday (11th). All section chiefs of the talks also attended, presided over by Section Chief Lu Qi, and gave detailed instructions on police methods to ensure that the city's police administration is unified and perfect.</p>
<p>Preventing Theft of Fire Hydrants</p>
<p>The city's police bureau fire department has recently found that more than one-fifth of the fire hydrants set up in various parts of the city have had parts stolen. Under the current decisive battle system, if this continues, it will have a great impact on the city's municipal construction and security protection. Moreover, enemy planes have recently been attempting to move into the Shanghai area, so fire equipment should be further strengthened. Therefore, the judicial department's crime prevention section was requested to assist in eliminating this illegal activity. It is learned that the authorities of the crime prevention section, after careful consideration and research, immediately presented it to the director of the judicial department, ordering each branch bureau to form a special search team composed of police detectives from the judicial section to conduct searches and defenses from 11:00 PM every night to 7:00 AM the next morning in order to eliminate the activities of petty thieves who destroy fire equipment and ensure the city's wartime security and sound air defense system.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The City Issued Several Alarms the Night Before Last <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>At 10:15 PM the night before last (10th), just as a heavy rain was pouring down, a warning alarm suddenly sounded in the city, and the whole city was immersed in a state of air raid alert. At 10:27 PM, it turned into an air raid alarm, and at 11:40 PM, the air raid alarm was lifted, but it was still in a state of alert. At 12:02 AM, another air raid alarm was issued, and at 1:00 AM, it turned into a warning alarm. At 3:05 AM, another air raid alarm was issued, and at 5:20 AM, it turned into a warning alarm again. At 5:55 AM, all alarms were finally lifted. According to an announcement by the authorities afterwards, 20 enemy American planes had raided northern Korea, western and northern Kyushu, and the San'in area. When they departed, they tried to conceal their movements by scattering in groups of four or five planes in all directions. One group of four or five planes passed over the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) area and then proceeded to their respective destinations, so the alarms were issued. However, they only passed through and did not attack.</p>

<p>In order to seek police and baojia connection and begin collecting unified baojia fees, the city's police bureau baojia department specially convened a joint meeting of baojia personnel above the level of district joint baochang some days ago. Now that the date for collection has been determined, and at the same time, in order to avoid the flow, it has been agreed that regardless of party, government, military, police, or public officials, as well as baojia workers, they will all pay baojia fees, except for the extremely poor. In order to hear the opinions of the police branch bureaus in each district, another joint meeting of the police branch bureau chiefs and the baojia section chiefs of each bureau was convened at 3:00 PM yesterday (11th) on the seventh floor of the city police bureau. The deputy chiefs of the twelve branch bureaus of Huangpu, Laozha, Xincheng, Changshu, Taishan, Changning, Huashan, Jiangning, Jing'an, Xinshijie, Putuo, and Zhaojiawan, as well as the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the baojia sections, attended.

<p>Purpose of the Meeting</p>
<p>Section Chief Gu Baojia, as chairman, immediately reported on the purpose of the meeting and elaborated on the discussions and proceedings of the joint baochang meeting the previous day, explaining separately: The starting date for the collection of baojia fees is set from August 15 to August 30, with fees for both July and August being collected together. The issue of fee collection and household registration investigation To avoid trouble for the joint baojia to remit funds, it was decided to use bank receipts as proof, and the penalty of 51% for late payment will be temporarily suspended before August 31. Except for shantytown residents and the extremely poor, all party, government, military, and police personnel will pay baojia fees. It was decided to start the movement to collect scrap metal on September 1, and the application forms will be allocated to each bureau for implementation. In order to fully coordinate the mutual exchange between the people and the police, the system of baojia self-defense will be changed. In order to confirm the identity of the self-defense, the armband will be newly replaced. In addition to being stamped by the regimental headquarters, the armband will also be jointly reviewed and stamped by each branch bureau and the general joint baojia. Identity cards will be issued to baojia personnel as proof. In addition, many instructions were given regarding the personnel of the baojia section of each bureau, whether the baojia self-defense meeting should be opened, and the issue of issuing residence permits. It is hoped that each branch bureau will closely cooperate with the baojia. Then, Chief Pinggang Police Defense gave detailed instructions on police and air defense aspects. Then, Chief Wu Island Special High gave a clear account of the management and ideological guidance of the special self-defense corps and agreed to the Qian Yitong's fee schedule. Finally, Section Chief Gu also hoped that each bureau would pay close attention to the cleanliness of the self-defense pavilions and the issue of evading military service and find ways to assist in improving them. Then, he distributed a survey form for the self-defense corps to promote everyone's willingness to serve. He further explained: The penalties for self-defense evasion will be formulated by the self-defense corps headquarters in the future, and the purpose will not be to impose fines, but to impose additional service on duty. Regarding late payment and resistance to payment of baojia fees, each bureau will first give advice based on the seriousness of the facts. If they do not comply, they will be punished by law. In short, the purpose of the baojia system in the future must be to benefit the people, and it is hoped that every citizen and the police bureau will sincerely cooperate to achieve close police and baojia ties, and so on, until it was completed at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Last Good Thought: A Special Expectation for Wealthy and Prominent Gentlemen <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the colleagues of the Joyful Magpie Troupe generously donated 22,000 yuan to support education, Mr. Zhang Xiangchi donated 10,000 yuan, and other gentlemen also made donations one after another, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. The enthusiasm of these gentlemen is truly admirable. Assuming that yesterday's donations can help fifteen outstanding students from impoverished families continue their studies, and if we use this as a proportion, we can assist three hundred people by the end of this month. Naturally, we rely on the great support of our readers. However, among those who have applied to this newspaper for educational assistance, there are already more than three thousand who have been unsuccessful due to insufficient funds. The ratio of two hundred to three thousand is only one-tenth. Therefore, even in the last twenty days, we still have high hopes and earnestly request readers to donate more so that we can approve all three thousand applicants, which would be the best-case scenario. However, it would be fortunate to exceed three hundred. At this moment, we especially hope for a single good thought from the wealthy and prominent businessmen.</p>
<p>Affordable Tuition at China Business College</p>
<p>Financial leaders of this city, Mr. Tang Shoumin, Mr. Ye Fuxiao, and Mr. Pei Yunqing, have jointly initiated the establishment of the China Business College, with the aim of cultivating talent for industry, commerce, and finance, and improving the efficiency of the industrial sector. It offers two departments: Business Administration and Banking, with a study period of two years, divided into six semesters. Males under the age of twenty-two who have graduated from high school are eligible to apply for admission. The application deadline is the 25th of this month, and a written examination will be held at Datong University on the 27th and 28th. This is a rare opportunity for young people who aspire to serve in the industrial and commercial sectors. To alleviate the burden on students' parents, the school offers extremely affordable tuition, with tuition and miscellaneous fees of only three thousand yuan per semester, which is especially rare. In addition, free places are available to help students from impoverished families. High school graduates who apply for this newspaper's scholarship and pass the entrance examination, if they wish to transfer to the school, can apply for registration at this newspaper's scholarship office and be introduced for free admission.</p>

The school is temporarily located at No. 1380, Lu Jia Zha Road, Xieqiao. All tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived. The teachers and staff employed are all experienced professionals. Public enrollment is scheduled for August 19th. Please send fifteen students from those approved by this office to be admitted without examination.

<h3 id="e46">Blood and Tears (12) Navy <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo Translated by Yang</p>
<p>After inspecting the iron-smelling surroundings, the training submarine I had just seen felt very narrow, and the simplicity of the structure was astonishing. Even the torpedo launcher was just one.</p>
<p>"So, where did Lieutenant Sakuma stand?"</p>
<p>Longfu looked at the command tower from the central launch platform. It was like looking at a water pipe from below. Stepping into the narrow, cramped round tube that was difficult for humans to pass through felt very uncomfortable. The place where the commander often commanded, and where he was during the disaster, was also where he wrote that will. On the wall of the round tube, the letter A was written in white.</p>
<p>Fourteen letters from A to N represented the location of the remains of the fourteen crew members. Just like Colonel I said, everyone died in their own posts. Private First Class Yuan desperately used the hand-operated water pump until his death, and it was still preserved in place. This kind of mark slightly revealed white in the darkness.</p>
<p>Although the real person had already been here five or six times, he still stood there blankly. At this time, the soundless silence made people imagine the situation of the ship sinking to the bottom of the sea and after the people had already died. The righteousness of the soldiers, maintained until the final sleep of the people, seemed to still exist in this submarine.</p>
<p>After the tour, Longfu ran out and remained respectful, unable to say a word. After walking a few steps from here, when I was about to go to the Zheshangshuijiao Zhenshan slope, a non-commissioned officer ran from the opposite direction. He was wearing a red collar of a Private Second Class. Looking over, this sergeant stood up straight, performed a correct military salute, and began talking to the person. It seemed like an important event was being discussed, and it took a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>"That fellow is my subordinate. Although he is three years older than me, he is completely like my younger brother. He is really a likable person."</p>
<p>When eating the most simple lunch poem in the Yongjiao Social Hall, Zhenren said this. In this tone, there was a surge of emotion, but Longfu did not pay attention to this, but just looked left and right at the simple dining hall. I had seen the Tokyo Suijiao Hall in Dongcheng Shujia's book, but this place was not as rich and luxurious as that, but it had a warm feeling.</p>
<p>Longfu decided to take the train that night and leave Wuzhen. This was because Zhenren said he was too busy, and he was afraid that staying until Monday would cause him trouble.</p>
<p>"Suppose you pass by on the way back, won't you come again? If I have a good opportunity, I would like to let you visit the military port. Maybe let you ride a warship once."</p>
<p>The soldier who came to see him off at the station felt very sad and said this.</p>
<p>"Thank you! I will definitely come again if I pass by on the way back. But I am really grateful for this time."</p>
<p>Longfu stuck his head out of the window in the car and said this very gratefully. The whistle of the starting car sounded, and Zhenren unconsciously said something loud and stared at Longfu:</p>
<p>"Okay, you work hard! I'll work hard too."</p>
<p>When Zhenren lightly raised his hand to the brim of his military cap to salute, this gesture made Longfu feel infinitely touched. No matter what, he couldn't say a word. The sight lines formed by the two people, like a rainbow in the sky, continued until they disappeared in the sky, and Longfu stopped looking at the faces of his relatives and friends. After a short while, Zhenren seemed very decisive and saluted again before leaving the East Station first.</p>
<p>When changing trains in Hiroshima at night, Longfu still missed the false person in his heart. But because he was very satisfied, he couldn't stay in Wu for two days.</p>
<p>(The false person has become a great soldier. And the officers I met in "Fukuda" were all pleasant people.)</p>
<p>That kind of air, for Longfu, was really like he got a great deal of favor, he certainly did not have the qualification to live in the country, but he was willing to feel, willing to experience, just hoping to be like in a painting, this made him satisfied (that is, simply understanding the spirit of the submarine, the harvest was big enough...)</p>
<p>Longfu thought this way, and fell asleep unconsciously.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shimonoseki, the morning light was already faint. In order to take the express train to Kojima, I had plenty of time to leisurely cross Shimonoseki Moji and have breakfast.</p>
<p>Stepping on the land of Kyushu, Longfu couldn't help but feel infinite emotion. Since running away from home, he finally had to go home. This kind of mood kept jumping in his heart. However, it was impossible to know to what extent winning the Navy Minister's award could comfort his parents.</p>
<p>As soon as the train passed Kawauchi, a huge wave immediately rose in the sea of ​​his heart. When he saw Sakurajima, his eyes were filled with hot tears. Just after three o'clock, he arrived in Kojima, and unexpectedly, his younger sister came to the station to meet him. (130)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Changing Residence Certificates, Improving Procedures <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>This time, the Baojia Chang Bureau changed the citizen certificates to residence certificates, in order to understand the people's difficulties, and allowed the use of old certificate photos. The good intentions are commendable. It is also heard that the procedures for citizens to obtain residence certificates are also simplified as much as possible, so that the common people can benefit. This is especially a cause for celebration for the future of the city. However, after investigating the Changshu District, the procedures for obtaining a residence certificate are extremely complicated. For the head of the household, before obtaining the certificate, he has already suffered from sore feet. The obstruction of the Baojia office, sticking to formalities, can be said to be unparalleled.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing is that the applicant's name must be stamped. Even children, maids, and old women must also be stamped. As a result, the money and time spent by citizens are not small, which is contrary to the authorities' purpose of simplifying and facilitating the people. Moreover, since the application form has already fingerprinted the person who stamped the seal, the fact that the seal is only a decorative formality should be relaxed. In addition, two photos per person can also be allowed to change and use old photos in a flexible manner to save the expenses of our small people. It is also heard that filling out the application form is only the first step in the procedure for obtaining a residence certificate. It is said that the procedures for fingerprinting and formally applying for the certificate are still complicated. It seems that it is necessary to pay attention to improvement. (Hong)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Several Questions on Applying for a Residence Certificate <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the concession on August 1st of last year, the replacement of residence certificates in the 182 districts was something we had anticipated. Because it is during a time of emergency, the authorities and the Lianbao have held several meetings in the past few weeks, the reason being to reduce the difficulties for applicants and all unnecessary waste. However, theory is theory, and unexpected problems have made many applicants feel that it is meaningless. Let the authorities and the Lianbao seriously discuss it.</p>
<p>The Applicant's Seal Problem</p>
<p>On a residence certificate application paper, in addition to the seals of the Jia leader and the household head, there must also be the applicant's fingerprint and seal. Fingerprints will of course not be a problem. As for the seal, it cannot be done individually, because applicants do not necessarily have seals, especially women, children who have just reached the age for needing a residence certificate, and maids and rickshaw pullers who work for others. Also, women mostly use "××shi" to replace their names. If they and she spend money to carve a round seal for this meaningless need and then have no other use for it, such consumption can be said to be too wasteful. Because the prevention of fraud and the unearned receipt of residence certificates does not lie in the seal, but focuses on the fingerprint. Moreover, the amount of this consumption can be quite staggering. In times of war, when we should be saving goods, can we still be so wasteful?</p>
<p>Fingerprinting Problem</p>
<p>The fingerprints on the application paper are said to be required to be pressed in person at the police station. If this is the case, difficulties will arise again, because if someone happens to be sick or has an accident and cannot participate in person on the day of fingerprinting, it would not be so difficult to first press the fingerprint at home and then hand it over to the Jia leader. When receiving the residence certificate, I think it is not necessary to have so many applicants crowding at the doors of the police station or the Lianbao office, but the residence certificate can be distributed to each applicant door-to-door by each Jia leader. The wise Bureau Chief and Lianbao will also be able to understand the difficulties of the applicants.</p>
<p>Extortion Problems in Nanshi</p>
<p>According to residents of Nanshi, the Lianbao is forcing applicants to purchase "residence certificate shells." Those who violate this will have their residence certificates withheld. It is hoped that the wise authorities and the Lianbao will ban this extortion and intimidation tactic.</p>
<p>Finally, I eagerly await the wise Bureau Chief and Lianbao to immediately send down "sweet rain." This is not only my good fortune, but also the good fortune of all applicants in Shanghai. (Wan Shi)</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Office's Obligatory Rehabilitation for Opium Addiction: Second Group Released After Rehabilitation, Third Group Starts Registration <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Way-Faring Society affiliated with the Nantong Road Righteousness Society, specially contracted by this office, has completed the second group rehabilitation for opium addiction at its temporary obligatory rehabilitation center. Yesterday afternoon, a farewell ceremony was held in the society's auditorium. Several hundred people, including police and formerly incorrigible individuals, were present. First, Mr. Wu, the chairman of the society, delivered the opening remarks. Then, doctors Tang Xiang and Yang Yusheng, as well as guests, delivered words of encouragement. Finally, a representative of the rehabilitated individuals delivered a speech of gratitude, reporting on the rehabilitation process and proving that the "Sacred Kang Drug" injection is indeed a modern miracle drug for quitting opium, completely free of pain or negative side effects. The heartfelt words moved the audience.</p>
<p>The society, in response to the needs of all parties and the entrustment of this office, has now begun registering for the third group. Young people with jobs who cannot afford rehabilitation can apply to this office for referral. However, given the current high cost of goods and financial difficulties, it is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that this beneficial act for the country and the people can be gradually promoted. This is what is earnestly hoped for.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Brief News on Catching Bedbugs <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The summer is hot, and it is impossible to sleep at night, and the infestation of bedbugs is truly a human disaster. I have now tried a simple method of catching them, for the public to use, which is both economical and convenient. Readers can try it. The method is to use two sheets of straw paper, divided into four half sheets, folded into a long shape, and pressed on the four corners of the brown bed frame. The ends of the straw paper must be placed inside and outside the brown bed and bed frame. The next morning, the bedbugs will gather at both ends of the straw paper, and you can take and catch them, which is very convenient, and the straw paper is not broken and can still be used.</p>
