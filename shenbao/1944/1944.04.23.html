<h3 id="c1">東方式的宣傳任務　吉田東佑 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>孫中山先生在一九一一三年十月，巾國國民黨聯歡會上曾說過：「軍事奮鬬，乃是推倒不良政府，和趕走一般軍閥官僚的；宣傳奮鬬，乃是改變不良社會，和感化人羣的。滅一般軍閥，軍事奮鬬固然重要，然改造家，則非根本改造人心不可。是故感化人羣的奮　，更爲重要」。在此也可以看出孫中山先生，往往認為宣傳重於軍事，且認宣傳是「改變不良社會，和感化人羣的」單純解釋宣傳爲「Propaganda」，而脫離「改善社會」「感化人心」的道德任務，則終非東方式的宣傳。同時，掩飾不利於己者，而只吶喊利於己者，這種宜傳方法，是英美式的。這種任意的「虛構」，決不會「改變不良社會和感化人羣的」，所以嚴格阿裡，這不能稱作「宣傳」。真正的宣傳，必須始終說老實話。昨天，我接到一封忠實的中國農民的信。現在按原文發表出來，以資讀者參考。根據遭封信，就會深切地感到，「必須改良這個不良的社會」這就是我所說的東方式宣傳。</p>
<p>吉田先生：</p>
<p>爲了節約先生實貴的時間，我們就除去習慣的客套，即向你開始直陳吧　我們在新聞紙上不是常常看到他們在宣傳著今年是增產年嗎？可是事實上痛心的說，今年或許要變减產年吧！這减產的原因，決不是一朝一日所釀成者，乃完全由於年來農民的經驗迫使他們走上這條不願走的路。淸鄉區捐稅的重重，肥佬成本的高昂，加至收買價格的低廉，成為三個主要原因，。根據上面的原因，農民們連經常的種田都在發生動搖，都在心灰意懶的神情下敷衍。雖然一方面對於收買價格和配給物品已有了理想的調整計劃，但這理想的計劃並不是澈底的，這理想的計劃就是能够公平的照計劃完全實行，亦不能使農民們高興到去努力增產的程度。爲什麼這樣好的辦法，還不能使農民們自動的高興到去努力增產呢？這就是上面的三個主要原因中最最重要的一個，還沒被當局注意而解決的緣故，那就是在淸鄉區裏的當地所謂「小皇帝」的虎威下捐稅的　重。此外譬如農民們家裏養了雞鴨之類的副產品，穿×服的老爺們如果要想吃的話，就可差個小兵向農民家裏不費錢去拿來吃，還有老百姓如果要通過檢問所的話，除非你是空身不帶一點東西，否則雖然明明知道不是統制品，祇要稍多拿一點，就非給買路錢不可。相反的不管你統制品不統制品，只要你給相常的代價，無論什麼東西，都可通過。我會親耳聽見朋友的朋友，當面說着不久他就要到某淸鄉地區做官去了，據說他的老板是以五十萬元運動下來的，他們的計劃是要在短短的期間賺它二百萬元還來的！這是多麼痛心的事呀！但這是鐵一般的事實！吉田先生１我們並不是什麼評論家觀察家，但我們所知道的是一般躲在辦公室王裏成天翻閱着各種新聞雜誌，和在報纸雜誌上唱着高調的評論家觀察家們所眼沒有看見，耳沒有聽見的現實情形！我們本來是不想設的，但這關於我們切身有關的糧食問題，決不能讓它有錯誤的。更囚爲食糧的種植是一年只有一度的，如果不幸的政策錯誤了，管理疏忽了，以致收穫的不良，那末要改善亦只能等待明年了，卽使再鎗斃幾個貪官，亦是無補於事的。因爲今年是決戰的準備年，亦就是生產的決戰年，事情當然不能等待明年的！所以今天鼓足了勇氣，衷心最誠懇的向你陳吿，請先生來一次有力的評論，趕緊催促政府及有關當局，乘現在耕種前還來得及的時候，對於未解決而被疏忽的一個大問題，來一個有効的對策，那末農民幸甚！社會幸甚！國家幸甚！大東亞大集團幸甚！則陵等十二人仝啟，叫月十七日。一般人說，大東亞戰爭是肅淸英美金融資本，而解放東亞的戰爭。同時，這一戰爭，必須剷除東亞內任何人剝削人的殘酷現象，而解放廣大人民羣衆，奠定眞正的東亞一王道樂土」。目前的戰爭，如澈底做到這一　時，像該讀者的中國農民，就會因「宣傳」而奮起，就會心悅誠服地歌頌。。「那末農民幸甚，社會幸甚！國家幸甚！大東亞大集團幸甚！」我堅決相信，欲使民衆達到這種衷心悅服的態度，就是東方式的宣傳任務，亦即孫中山先生所說的「傳任」任務（魯譯）</p>

<p>仰光二十二日中央社電　日印同盟軍刻正園攻扼守伊姆法爾南方重要據點梅朗南面隘路口之頑敵，由於十大·七兩聳夜之猛攻，終擊潰敗敵，並一鼓突入梅朗，殲滅抵抗之頑敵，十八日佔領該地。敵軍於日印同盟軍迫至梅朗隘路口之同時，即以第二十三師爲中心，約一萬之兵力配以大砲及戰車，集結於該地區拼命抵抗，然終被日印軍精銳所蹂躪，伊姆怯爾盆地南方防衛綫，於茲巳吿瓦解。由於日印軍自北東雙方之猛攻，伊姆法爾盆地英第四軍之命運，已危在旦夕矣。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　前錢某基地訊，敵軍五百名，前曾據守哥布馬西方二公里之高地實行頑抗，日軍自九日起不分書夜對之予以猛攻，卒使敵陣陷於混亂狀態後而佔領之，終一面追擊敗敵，一面與據守交多馬（哥希馬西北四公里）西北高地頑抗之殘敵激戰中。又日軍精銳一部，於十五日晚殲滅北克苦來馬（介茲馬北方十公里）附近之敵後予以佔領。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地電，日軍俯衝轟炸機隊，曾于十八日未明襲擊茅魯附近之敵空輸挺進隊陣地，衝破敵關機炮之彈幕，猛攻敵滑翔機降落塲，當炸毁陸上敵滑翔機六架，並轟炸其他附屬設施，使其一處起火，日機全隊安返根據地。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日東條目相二十一日下午六時半在官邸設宴，招待菲律賓答禮特派大使阿齊諾一行及菲駐日大使伐爾加斯，日全體閣僚及陪賓等二百餘人列席，席間首由阿齊諾起立致詞，爲日天皇陛下祝壽，嗣由東條目相祝洛勒爾大總統之健康。復由柬條首相致詞，表明歡迎特派大使一行來訪，旋由阿齊諾特派大使代表菲律賓政府及其國民致謝辭，賓王極盡歡洽，直至下午八時許始散。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　重光外相，靑木大東亞相，二十二日晚在外相官邸爲菲律賓答　使節團舉行歡迎晚餐會，出席者來賓方面有菲律賓特派大使阿齊諾及隨員阿拉斯，阿爾南，加里巴比，奧西亞斯。日方有重光外相，靑本大東亞相，石度藏相，岡部文相，天羽情報局總裁，蓮沼侍從長，後宮參謀次長，澤本海軍次長，罔部軍務局長，村田大使，本間中將，松本外務次官等。席間重光外相致辭，之和菲律賓之前途光輝，阿齊諾特派大使致答辭，賓王暢談極爲歡洽，迄九時始散。</p>
<p>日首相歡迎詞</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日東條首相致辭大意如次：菲律賓爲表示感謝日本援助其獨立及締結同盟條約之厚意，特派阿齊諾閣下爲答禮使節來日，並於本日觀見天皇陛下，墨　國書，於此圓滿達成所負任務，洵堪慶賀。帝國高舉解放東亞民族大　，奮然倔起，對敵英·美宣戰，瞬將美軍逐出菲非律賓，其問阿齊諾閣下以次各位，均曾爲菲律賓之更生而奮鬥，由於菲律賓國民諸君努力邁進結果，至去年十月，菲律賓遂宣吿獨立。同時，日·菲兩國間亦締結同盟條約，自此日·菲兩國關係遂日臻密切，茲非律賓國民於洛勒爾總統閣下領導下，努力向篷到大東亞民族共同自的之途勇往邁進，此種精神，實令本人至深感佩。當茲戰局益趨緊急之際，大東亞十億民族，爲確保及建設外，東亞共榮　應團結一致，共赴時艱，此實爲東亞民族之常前急務。值此決戰之秋，菲律賓隊能於洛勒爾總統閣下及出席各位領導下，與日本協力一致完逐大東亞戰爭，此不僅日。菲兩國，即大東亞十億民族亦應爲之快慰萬分。合帝國爲擎潰英。美，於獲得最後勝利前，決不中止，刻己於國內各方面整備決戰態勢，克服一切困難，急向勝利之途上　進，爲建設大東亞，完成大東亞戰爭，尙望菲律賓國民諸君亦與帝國緊密提携，而作最大努力。</p>
<p>阿齊諾氏答詞</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電阿齊　特派大使答辭要旨如次：菲律賓之歷史實為獲取國家獨立不斷鬥爭之記錄，緣菲律賓始爲葡人侵略，繼而爲西班牙人征服，至最後卒爲美國減亡。其間菲律賓數千志士，曾爲獲得神聖之自由而奮門流血，但未見成功，竟成為美國經濟榨取政策之犧牲者，淪爲原料供給地，同時更在人種上遭受不平等之待遇。因日本獲得空前勝利，大東亞共榮圈已吿確立，同時與此形成同一命運之信念，亦已深透亞洲每一角落，共榮圈全體之案榮與福社，與各國各個芝繁榮，完全一致之信念，亦愈形穩固。此種信念乃帝國政府所率先垂範之誠實行為與博愛等之產物，蓋日政府於佔領地域所實施者，乃與過去數世紀歐美對被征服國所採之彈壓榨取政策全然相反故也。日軍沸起正義之信念，繼續進攻，且在後方尙有四億中國國民，三億印度國民，一億日本國民，三千萬滿洲國民及數千萬緬甸國民及菲律賓國民之熱意支援。談及資源，則世界中最豐饒之地區及近代作戰不可缺少之原料資源，悉在日軍掌握中，尙需一年，二年甚至五年，吾人之目下犧牲或再繼續相當期間，但總之勝利之掛冠終須加於擁護亞洲至億民衆與夫正義權力者之首。</p>
<p>菲律賓國現狀</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電菲特派大使阿齊諾，二十二日最於大東亞迎賓館會見記者團，以菲國之現狀爲中心，發表麼話如次：關於此次訪日印象，已於廣播中申述，其中本人特別感到者，即日本國民具有爲公忘私，以國家爲先之精神，此點我等應傚法之，同時又不禁爲日本慶，關於菲國發展情况，就經濟言，於戰時中所被破壞者，目下正在復興過程中，正努力推進復興工作。就文化言，政府方針以東亞性格的明確化爲着重點，敎育方面掃除個人主義，培養團體精神，摒去物資主義，而取精神主義，菲國民養成在打破個人至上主義，確立國家優先思想，此點實覺爲最切要之事。關於政治方面，以憲注爲中心，按其根本精神而實踐之，務期漸次達到圓滿之結果。菲國官民對大東亞戰爭之態度，在東條首相晚餐會席上及對日本國民廣播中均己闡明，總之，我等當全國一致，爲日本之勝利而與以澈底協力。</p>

<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　淪方西北公路，於過去乃蘇聯利用爲援淪之路綫，然最近因發生蒙古軍越境事件，致該路於事實上已被封鎖，此是證渝蘇關係已趨冷淡。茲據路透社重慶十一日特訊，軍慶迪化問全長約達三千二百公里公路，與蘇聯迎絡迪化阿爾馬阿塔鍛優秀之公路，同爲最重要之援渝路綫，及一九四〇年德蘇戰開始後，渝方曾作種種努力。然過去三年間，並未能利用該路，供給渝方何等軍需品云。</p>

<p>仰光二十二日中央社電　十月十四日，正值印度方面酣戰之際，有日運輸船數艘航行於印度洋上，爲防敵方潛艇乘機騷擾，遂遣飛機護送，石川曹長即担任警戒之一駕駛員也。航行至上午十一時二十分，突有敵方潛艇出現，立向輪送船發射大型魚雷三枚，石川曹長發見後，即連絡各機以俯衝式轟炸法，向潛沒中之潛艇施以猛炸，然敵潛艇所發射之魚雷，仍直衝向日運輸船而來。石川曹長見此，以爲轟炸潛艇固屬重要，而同時亦須阻止魚雷之前進。當時日運輪船雖已開始回避，但石川曹長仍恐該運輸船遭難，遂開足馬力，直追魚雷，開始激烈之掃射，奈魚雷仍未爆炸。石川曹長以值此千鈞一髪之際，斷不容稍加猶豫，遂毅然不顧一切，一照準魚雷，以機體相拼，轟然一聲，魚雷爆炸，水烟混成一片，當時石川曹長之飛機亦隨之消逝，於是運輸船上之將兵及重要資材乃免於難。石川曹長之犧牲個人，成全大衆，該船全體莫不感激流涕。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　英政府突然限制駐英中立國外交官特權，此種非常措置，頓引起英美兩國內幾多猜疑。據倫敦華盛頓方面所傳消息，衆料反軸心軍或將於下週或本週內侵人西歐，羣情極爲緊張。英太國目今春三月以來，已停止西班牙葡葡牙端士直布羅陀北非等地之航空郵信，及援取限制交通等揩置，積極對外界斷絕往來，唯一殘存之瑞士空路，亦於本月十五日停止，英本士現巳被外界認爲「謎之孤島」，路透社形容此爲「被檢閱官包團之一大兵營」。總之，第二戰線何時建立，此兩年來之世界課題現巳益臻迫切，但此為反軸心方面最高統帥事項，故流言亦祗爲流言而已。第三戰綫迄今仍有兩種見解，一方面認爲已迫在眉睫又一方面認爲勢將遲延，後者之代表者例如美國赫斯特系報紙論稱，英國比種措置，顯爲英美神經戰之一部，此與日美開戰前，美海軍上將會誇稱英軍可預三周內覆減日本艦隊如出一轍，僅世界威赫而已又中立國之遲延論者亦嘲笑稱，英美空軍連續轟炸德國比利時荷蘭之戰略交通網，及該方面通往德西部之鐵路幹綫，顯係表示即將侵入之一種擬態。此種轟炸如不即刻展開侵入作戰，則被破壞之交通綫即可恢復原狀，並不能發生任何效果。又反軸心軍於侵人西歐前，爲減低德空軍之防禦力量，擬盡量破壞德空軍戰鬥機。反之，測預反軸心軍即將侵入西歐者以德方最力，德軍政首腦力稱，英美之侵入先作戰，準備現已完成，德軍最高司令部對於侵入作戰迫切，似握有何種明確證據，柏林方面亦由氣象條件等推測，謂敵軍將於數週內開始登陸作戰。現德空軍偵察隊動不分書夜，從事偵察活正。</p>

<p>日軍及印度國民之進繫印度，乃印度解放戰之第一步。英國不能不淸算其三百年來榨取印度的時期，終於降臨了。德國各報進日詳戟東京發出的印度新戰綫之發展情形，而致非常的關心與期待。</p>
<p>佛爾基亞新聞報稱：「戰事業已移至印度本國」，並稱頌日軍及印度國民軍之戰果如次：</p>
<p>展開解放的解決戰</p>
<p>「日印軍的戰果，祇因在山岳地帶，且敵利用一切有利情勢從事防禦，故不能不加以稱頌。日印軍在蒙特巴頓所主持的孟多南方印緬區城戰役，毫無動搖，英軍在這區域業已蒙受極天損害。大事宣傳的所謂侵攻緬甸，比南義戰綫的英美軍還遲鈍，日印軍在離此區域東北四百公里的地點。進擊印度國內，所以這區域早已喪失了戰門發展的可能性，日印軍的進攻印度，今後將如何進行，在今日自尚難語言，但解放的決定戰，今已在印度國內展開，這大概是可以確定的，英國怎樣殘酷地且無情地支配印度，現在又怎樣在弱無力，從孟加拉的　　一事，也就可以明白了</p>
<p>四月六日「交易所日報」在其論說上聲述如次：</p>
<p>「英國精銳部隊雖然盡力防禦，但日本軍及印度國民軍終於在比較短促的時日中克服了這山岳地帶之地理的障礙，進攻印度了。這表示日印軍德作戰是怎樣的巧妙，戰鬥精神是怎樣的堅忍不拔。日印軍的進改印度，不堇殲滅了英軍的大部隊及美軍的一部，英國且由此而喪失了奪還細甸的最後機會。幾個月來反復展開開的據點爭奪戰，至此成爲重大的決定戰。</p>
<p>打破英國的煽動賓傳</p>
<p>百餘年來姿意人配印度的英國，不能不在印度國內防守其生命綫。英國的印度政策，幾十年來都是在外部防禦印度的貞潔威脅，現在也終於崩潰了。英國宣傳說日本以征服印度為目的，但沒有一個印度人會相信這話罷　東條首相聲明日本對印度毫無領土的或其他野心，祗欲解放印度民族，這聲明打破了英國的煽動宣傳。</p>
<p>江特拉鮑斯氏組成其國民軍後，不出數月，今巴出動前綫，這是應該十分滿足的。到德里的路上，尚須支付極大的犧牲，且他們又是全印度民衆所憧憬的目的。鮑斯氏必將實現恢復「祖國的自由』。」（翔：四月十二日西部朝日新</p>

<p>上海人觀念，現成小吾主義了，祗圖自己享樂，不顧他人死活，所以消費事業特別發達，公共事業難能孕育。例如，鍛近警察消費合作社籌借基金一事，據說成績欠佳，這樣爲謀地方治安着想的事業，關係市民安全何等軍要，尤其有產階級的人們，更比平民爲重要，而上海數百萬市民對此似無熱烈輸將的情狀。據說還有某銀行經理竟持反對態度的，這是非常遺憾了。</p>
<p>某銀行經理，他並非希望沒有警察而歡迎盜賊光顧，更非希望沒有警察在後自己去打劫他人，老實說一句，這位經理，要是不知集沙成搭推卸責任之外，祗知自己賺錢，是自己本領，當然自己化永，人家不夠開支，干我鳥事。殊不知吃的由他人田裏耕耘出來的，住的由他人建築出來的，穿的也由他人織製出來的，設無他人，雖有金錢，也不能肆意享樂。所謂：「人不能離社會而獨自生存的。」明乎此，有錢的人也當與無錢的人着想，非但時時爲自己打算，亦當常常爲他障大眾財產安全，生命安全，而警察生活安定問題，當然大眾替他者想謀解決的。</p>
<p>崇金主義的猶太人，他能操縱使節金融，經商賺錢的伎倆，爲任何民族所不及，可是他們獨無地方觀念國家思想，以致國土淪沉，國家滅亡，捆　扛挑，漂泊四海，到處受人摒棄，無處可容，無處可家，他們精神上的痛苦，恐十倍於上海平民，顧有錢無地也不能安定不能快樂，猶太人可爲上海一般富翁作前車之鑒矣。總而言之，上海人目前環境，甚至整個國人的環境，祗有自己不顧他人是不可以了，有了金錢沒有思想也是不可能了，所以自己有了飯吃，也要希望人間愛有飯吃，能夠達到整個民族安定時，才算自己安定了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Eastern-Style Propaganda Mission by Yoshihiro Toyosuke <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said at a Kuomintang reunion in October 1913: "Military struggle is to overthrow bad governments and drive away warlords and bureaucrats; propaganda struggle is to change bad societies and influence the people. To eliminate warlords, military struggle is certainly important, but to transform the country, it is essential to fundamentally transform people's hearts. Therefore, the struggle to influence the people is even more important." From this, we can also see that Mr. Sun Yat-sen often regarded propaganda as more important than military affairs and believed that propaganda was "to change bad societies and influence people." Simply interpreting propaganda as "Propaganda" and detaching it from the moral mission of "improving society" and "influencing people's hearts" is ultimately not Eastern-style propaganda. At the same time, concealing what is unfavorable to oneself and only shouting what is favorable to oneself is an Anglo-American style of propaganda. Such arbitrary "fabrication" will never "change bad societies and influence the people." Therefore, strictly speaking, this cannot be called "propaganda." True propaganda must always tell the truth. Yesterday, I received a letter from a sincere Chinese farmer. Now, I am publishing it in its original form for readers to refer to. Based on this letter, one will deeply feel that "this bad society must be improved." This is what I call Eastern-style propaganda.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshida:</p>
<p>In order to save your valuable time, we will skip the usual pleasantries and get straight to the point. Don't we often see in the newspapers that they are promoting this year as a year of increased production? But in fact, and it pains us to say this, this year may turn out to be a year of reduced production! The reason for this reduction in production is by no means something that has happened overnight, but is entirely due to the experiences of farmers over the years that have forced them to take this unwilling path. The heavy taxes in the pacification areas, the high cost of fertilizer, coupled with the low purchase prices, have become the three main reasons. Due to the above reasons, even the regular farming of farmers is being shaken, and they are perfunctorily going through the motions with a disheartened expression. Although there is an ideal adjustment plan for purchase prices and allocated goods on the one hand, this ideal plan is not thorough. Even if this ideal plan can be fairly implemented according to plan, it cannot make the farmers happy enough to work hard to increase production. Why is it that such a good method still cannot make the farmers automatically happy enough to work hard to increase production? This is because the most important of the three main reasons mentioned above has not been noticed and resolved by the authorities, that is, the heavy taxes under the tyranny of the so-called "little emperors" in the pacification areas. In addition, for example, if the gentlemen in × uniforms want to eat the by-products such as chickens and ducks raised by the farmers at home, they can send a soldier to take them from the farmers' homes without paying a penny. Also, if the common people want to pass through the checkpoints, unless you are empty-handed and carry nothing, otherwise, even if you clearly know that it is not a controlled item, as long as you take a little more, you have to pay a toll. Conversely, regardless of whether it is a controlled item or not, as long as you pay a considerable price, anything can pass. I heard a friend of a friend say in person that he would soon go to a certain pacification area to be an official. It is said that his boss used 500,000 yuan to secure the position, and their plan is to earn 2 million yuan back in a short period of time! This is such a painful thing! But this is an ironclad fact! Mr. Yoshida! We are not critics or observers, but what we know is the reality that the critics and observers who hide in the office all day long, reading various news magazines, and singing high-profile tunes in newspapers and magazines have not seen with their eyes or heard with their ears! We originally didn't want to say this, but this matter concerning our vital food problem must not be allowed to have any errors. Moreover, because the planting of food is only once a year, if the policy is unfortunately wrong and the management is negligent, resulting in a poor harvest, then improvement can only wait until next year, even if a few more corrupt officials are shot, it will not help. Because this year is the year of preparation for the decisive battle, that is, the year of the decisive battle for production, things certainly cannot wait until next year! Therefore, today we have mustered up the courage to sincerely report to you in the most sincere way, please ask the gentleman to make a strong comment, and quickly urge the government and relevant authorities to take effective countermeasures for a big problem that has not been resolved and has been neglected while there is still time before planting. Then the farmers will be fortunate! The society will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate! The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be fortunate! Twelve people including Ling, etc., July 17th. Generally speaking, the Greater East Asia War is a war to eliminate Anglo-American financial capital and liberate East Asia. At the same time, this war must eliminate the cruel phenomenon of anyone exploiting people in East Asia, liberate the broad masses of the people, and lay the foundation for a true Eastern paradise of benevolent rule. If the current war thoroughly achieves this goal, then the Chinese farmers, like the readers, will rise up because of "propaganda" and sing praises wholeheartedly. "Then the farmers will be fortunate, the society will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate! The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be fortunate!" I firmly believe that to make the people reach this heartfelt and joyful attitude is the task of Eastern-style propaganda, that is, the "propaganda task" mentioned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen (Lu Translation)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Result of Two Days and Nights of Fierce Attacks: Japanese-Indian Forces Occupy Meilang; Fate of Enemy in Imphal Basin in Peril <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 22nd – The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces are currently encircling and attacking the stubborn enemy guarding the important stronghold of Meilang, the southern gateway to Imphal. Due to two days and nights of fierce attacks, they finally defeated the enemy and stormed into Meilang, annihilating the resisting enemy and occupying the area on the 18th. As the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces approached the Meilang pass, the enemy, centered on the 23rd Division, concentrated about 10,000 troops equipped with artillery and tanks in the area to resist desperately. However, they were eventually crushed by the elite Japanese-Indian forces, and the southern defense line of the Imphal Basin has now collapsed. Due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian forces from both the north and east, the fate of the British Fourth Army in the Imphal Basin is in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – From a certain front base: Five hundred enemy troops had previously entrenched themselves on a high ground two kilometers west of Kohima and stubbornly resisted. The Japanese army launched fierce attacks day and night from the 9th, finally causing the enemy陣 to fall into chaos before occupying it. They continued to pursue the defeated enemy and engaged in fierce battles with the remnants of the enemy entrenched on the northwestern highlands of Khotoma (four kilometers northwest of Kohima). In addition, a unit of elite Japanese troops annihilated the enemy near North Kukruma (ten kilometers north of Kezuma) on the evening of the 15th and occupied it.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, a Japanese dive bomber squadron attacked the enemy's airborne commando base near Mauru before dawn on the 18th. They broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft artillery barrage and attacked the enemy's glider landing field fiercely, destroying six enemy gliders on the ground and bombing other auxiliary facilities, causing a fire at one location. The entire Japanese squadron returned safely to its base.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo held a banquet at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. on the 21st to entertain Philippine Special Envoy Aquino and Philippine Ambassador to Japan Vargas, along with all Japanese cabinet members and over 200 guests. During the banquet, Aquino stood up first to give a speech, wishing His Majesty the Emperor longevity, followed by Prime Minister Tojo wishing President Laurel good health. Then Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech, expressing his welcome to the special envoy's visit. Special Envoy Aquino then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the Philippine government and its people. The guests and hosts were extremely happy and harmonious, and the banquet did not end until around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki held a welcome dinner party for the Philippine delegation at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the evening of the 22nd. Guests from the Philippines included Special Envoy Aquino and his entourage, including Alas, Arnan, Calipapi, and Osias. From the Japanese side were Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Finance Minister Ishiwata, Education Minister Okabe, Information Bureau President Amau, Chamberlain Hasunuma, Vice Chief of Staff Kogo, Vice Admiral Sawamoto, Military Affairs Bureau Director Okabe, Ambassador Murata, Lieutenant General Honma, and Vice Foreign Minister Matsumoto. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu gave a speech, wishing a bright future for the Philippines, and Special Envoy Aquino gave a reply. The guests and hosts chatted enthusiastically and harmoniously, and the party ended at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – The gist of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's speech is as follows: The Philippines, to express its gratitude for Japan's assistance in its independence and the conclusion of the alliance treaty, has sent His Excellency Aquino as a special envoy to Japan and today saw His Majesty the Emperor and presented the letter of credence, thus fulfilling the mission entrusted to him. This is truly commendable. The Empire has raised the banner of liberating the nations of East Asia and resolutely declared war on the enemy, Britain and the United States, and quickly expelled the American army from the Philippines. During this time, Your Excellency Aquino and others have fought for the rebirth of the Philippines. As a result of the efforts of the Filipino people, the Philippines declared independence last October. At the same time, the alliance treaty was concluded between Japan and the Philippines, and since then, the relationship between Japan and the Philippines has become increasingly close. The Filipino people, under the leadership of President Laurel, are working hard and bravely advancing towards the common goal of the Greater East Asian nations. This spirit is truly admirable to me. At this time when the war situation is becoming increasingly urgent, the billion people of Greater East Asia, in order to ensure and build East Asia's co-prosperity, should unite and work together to overcome the difficulties. This is truly the urgent task of the East Asian nations. At this time of decisive battle, the Philippines' ability, under the leadership of President Laurel and those present, to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War is not only a source of satisfaction for Japan and the Philippines, but also for the billion people of Greater East Asia. The Empire will crush Britain and the United States and will not stop until it achieves final victory. It has already prepared for a decisive battle in all aspects domestically, overcome all difficulties, and is rapidly advancing towards victory. In order to build Greater East Asia and complete the Greater East Asia War, I hope that the Filipino people will also cooperate closely with the Empire and make the greatest effort.</p>
<p>Aquino's Reply</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – The main points of the reply of Special Envoy Aquino are as follows: The history of the Philippines is actually a record of continuous struggle to obtain national independence. The Philippines was first invaded by the Portuguese, then conquered by the Spanish, and finally annexed by the United States. During this time, thousands of Filipino patriots fought and bled to obtain sacred freedom, but they did not succeed and became victims of the United States' economic exploitation policy, becoming a source of raw materials, and at the same time suffering unequal treatment in terms of race. Because Japan has won unprecedented victories, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been established, and at the same time, the belief of forming the same destiny with it has also deeply penetrated every corner of Asia. The belief that the prosperity and welfare of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere are completely consistent with the prosperity of each country is becoming more and more solid. This belief is the product of the honest behavior and philanthropy of the Imperial Government, because what the Japanese government has implemented in the occupied areas is completely the opposite of the oppression and exploitation policies adopted by Europe and the United States towards the conquered countries in the past centuries. The Japanese army is rising up with the belief in justice and continuing its offensive, and behind it there are the enthusiastic support of 400 million Chinese people, 300 million Indian people, 100 million Japanese people, 30 million Manchu people, and tens of millions of Burmese and Filipino people. In terms of resources, the richest regions in the world and the raw material resources indispensable for modern warfare are all in the hands of the Japanese army. It may take a year, two years, or even five years, and our sacrifices may continue for a considerable period of time, but in the end, the crown of victory must be added to the heads of those who support Asia and the rights of justice.</p>
<p>Present Situation of the Philippines</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Philippine Special Envoy Aquino met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Guest House on the 22nd and spoke about the current situation in the Philippines. The main points are as follows: Regarding my impression of this visit to Japan, I have already stated it in the broadcast. Among them, what I particularly feel is that the Japanese people have a spirit of forgetting themselves for the sake of the public and putting the country first. We should imitate this point, and at the same time, I can't help but congratulate Japan. Regarding the development of the Philippines, economically speaking, what was destroyed during the war is currently in the process of being restored, and we are working hard to promote the restoration work. In terms of culture, the government's policy focuses on clarifying the character of East Asia. In education, we are eliminating individualism and cultivating team spirit, abandoning materialism and taking spiritualism. The Filipino people are developing the idea of breaking down individualism and establishing national priority, which I feel is the most important thing. Regarding the political aspect, we are practicing it based on the constitution, with the fundamental spirit at its center, striving to gradually achieve satisfactory results. The attitude of the Philippine officials and people towards the Greater East Asia War has been clarified at the dinner party of Prime Minister Tojo and in the broadcast to the Japanese people. In short, we will unite as a country and provide thorough cooperation for Japan's victory.</p>
<h3 id="e4">General Situation of Various Tribes in Homalin and Kohima <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – According to a certain Japanese army base station in Assam, there are non-Burmese and non-Indian ethnic groups who live in tribal life with their unique customs, habits, and languages in the mountainous area after crossing the Kaderan (Yedwin) River. They are the ethnic minorities on the Indian-Burmese border, numbering about 110,000, and have considerable influence and territory. The details of their situation are still under investigation. Here, I will only introduce the general situation of the various tribes along the way from Homalin to Kohima based on what the reporter has seen and heard: From the Chindwin River to the west, from Kohima and east of Imphal, from the Patkai Mountains and the mountain ranges of the Arakan Mountains, the Naga highlands in the Indian language, and the Chin Hills in the Burmese language, the majority of ethnic groups living here are called the Naga tribe or the Chin tribe. Their houses are densely packed on the mountain peaks, and every morning you can see residents carrying large bamboo tubes up and down the mountain roads. This kind of method is probably to prevent mountain floods, avoid diseases, and also to make it easy to interact with other tribes. Customs there: men and women are barefoot, like to wear bracelets and earrings, and wear only a towel-sized piece of cloth called Garo Bi from the shoulders down. In addition to farming, men hunt and women spin and weave. They like to eat meat and drink alcohol. The alcohol is similar to glutinous rice wine, and the meat called Mithun, which is similar to buffalo meat, is the most precious. The remaining bones of the "Mithun" are all placed at the door of the house. It seems that not only the head of Mithun, but all bones are cherished. Entering their home, you can see decorations with countless deer and pig bones. The wooden pillars are carved with the heads of long-horned beasts. They worship spirits. When a person dies, they are placed in a corner of the house, and prayers are offered in front of them all night before burial. Most marriages are within the tribe near the house, but they are also allowed to marry with other tribes. The man gives tiger claws or "Mithun" meat to the desired person as a betrothal gift. Before marriage, the relationship between men and women is extremely strict. There are many rituals for farmers. On the night of the ritual, a large gate is erected at the entrance of the tribe, a big feast is held, and they dance and sing. When making alliances, they chew tiger teeth, meaning that if they violate this alliance, they will lose their lives to tigers. I have seen them chew tiger teeth and swear when cooperating with the Japanese army. Their cooperation with the Japanese-Indian alliance is truly commendable. One tribe with a population of less than 600 people has automatically volunteered to cooperate with the Japanese army. They are rising up with the spirit of reducing the British army. These ethnic groups will also be liberated by the hand of the Japanese army one by one.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Northwest Highway of Chongqing Interrupted <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 22nd – The Northwest Highway of the Reclaimed Area was once used by the Soviet Union as a route to aid Chongqing. However, recently, due to the incident of Mongolian troops crossing the border, the road has been effectively blocked. This is evidence that the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union has become cold. According to a special Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 11th, the highway from Chongqing to Dihua, which is about 3,200 kilometers long, and the excellent highway from the Soviet Union to Dihua and Alma-Ata, are the most important routes to aid Chongqing. Chongqing has made various efforts since the beginning of the German-Soviet War in 1940. However, in the past three years, it has not been able to use the road to supply Chongqing with any military supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Collision with Enemy Torpedoes: Transport Ship Avoids Disaster; Japanese Petty Officer Ishikawa Dies <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 22nd – On October 14th, when the battle in India was in full swing, several Japanese transport ships were sailing in the Indian Ocean. In order to prevent enemy submarines from taking the opportunity to harass them, they sent aircraft to escort them. Petty Officer Ishikawa was one of the pilots in charge of guarding them. At 11:20 a.m., an enemy submarine suddenly appeared and immediately fired three large torpedoes at the transport ship. After Ishikawa saw this, he contacted the other aircraft and used dive bombing to bombard the submerged submarine. However, the torpedoes fired by the enemy submarine still rushed towards the Japanese transport ship. Ishikawa saw this and thought that bombing the submarine was important, but at the same time, it was also necessary to stop the advance of the torpedoes. Although the Japanese transport ship had begun to evade, Ishikawa was still afraid that the transport ship would suffer. So he opened up the throttle and chased after the torpedoes, starting a fierce strafing attack. But the torpedoes still did not explode. Ishikawa believed that at this critical moment, there was no room for hesitation, so he resolutely disregarded everything and aimed the aircraft at the torpedoes to collide with them. With a loud bang, the torpedoes exploded, and the water vapor became a cloud. At that time, Ishikawa's aircraft also disappeared. Therefore, the soldiers and important materials on the transport ship were saved from disaster. Petty Officer Ishikawa sacrificed himself to save the masses, and everyone on the ship was grateful and wept.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Shipbuilding Capacity Greatly Increased <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – The Japanese government, in view of the importance of supply and transportation in modern warfare, had previously started to implement the construction of armored ships. Since last year, shipbuilding capacity has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the increased transportation capacity makes it easier to import raw materials from various southern regions. Also, regarding the wooden shipbuilding sector, the productivity of only the hull last year has exceeded the planned target, while the productivity of the engine has not yet reached the expected results. Recently, due to the efforts of the Japan Maritime Transport Bureau and local government agencies to improve the method of distributing the forest, the lack of engine productivity has also increased recently.</p>

<p>Tianjin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – There are many underground caves in the vicinity of Xian County, Hebei Province, most of which are now occupied by Communist troops. During mopping-up operations, the Japanese army must conduct organized searches to be effective. A certain unit of the Japanese army recently discovered a secret propaganda organ of the Communist Party, the "Victory News," in a location 24 kilometers west of Liulu Village (Xian County). This secret organ was located in an underground cave, and the newspaper was full of Yan'an's propaganda and rumors, as well as military and world war news from the British and American sides. It is reported that the newspaper was an anti-Japanese propaganda organ of the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army division, founded in Xixiyan, Xiaoyang County, by Deputy Commander Kong Qingtong and Political Commissar Jin Cheng in November of the year before last. Due to Japanese army sweeps, it was moved from Xian County to Liulu Village.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Since the Guangdong Provincial Government prohibited money exchange transactions and implemented measures such as investigating hoarding, prices of general goods in the province have fallen across the board. Compared with the price of 100 catties of local rice on March 20th, the price on the 18th had fallen by 56 yuan. On the 23rd, it continued to fall by another 143 yuan. After entering April, the decline continued. Looking at the reasons for the drop in rice prices, the above-mentioned government measures are the biggest reason. On the one hand, the Provincial Grain Bureau implemented the third rice storage and low-price sales for eight days starting on the 18th, and the sharp increase in production after the establishment of the First Machinery Factory in March is also a major reason for the drop in rice prices.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – The British government's sudden restriction of the privileges of diplomats from neutral countries stationed in Britain has caused much suspicion in both Britain and the United States. According to news from London and Washington, it is widely expected that the anti-Axis forces will invade Western Europe within the next week or this week, and the atmosphere is extremely tense. Since March of this year, Britain has suspended air mail to Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Gibraltar, North Africa, and other places, and has adopted measures to restrict transportation, actively cutting off contact with the outside world. The only remaining air route to Switzerland was also suspended on the 15th of this month. Britain is now considered by the outside world as a "mysterious isolated island." Reuters described it as "a large military camp surrounded by inspectors." In short, when the second front will be established, this world issue of the past two years has become increasingly urgent, but this is a matter for the supreme commanders of the anti-Axis forces, so rumors are just rumors. There are still two views on the third front, one side believes that it is imminent and the other side believes that it will be delayed. Representatives of the latter, such as the American Hearst newspapers, argue that Britain's actions are obviously part of a psychological war by Britain and the United States, which is the same as when the US Admiral boasted that the British army could destroy the Japanese fleet in three weeks before the outbreak of the war between Japan and the United States, just a world of intimidation. Neutral countries who delay the invasion also mockingly said that the British and American air forces continuously bomb Germany's strategic transportation networks in Belgium and the Netherlands, and the railway lines leading to western Germany, which are obviously a kind of pretense of imminent invasion. If this kind of bombing does not immediately launch an invasion operation, the damaged transportation lines can be restored to their original state and cannot have any effect. Before invading Western Europe, the anti-Axis forces intend to destroy the German air force's fighter planes as much as possible in order to reduce the defensive power of the German air force. On the other hand, Germany is the most adamant in predicting that the anti-Axis forces will soon invade Western Europe. German military and political leaders claim that the British and American invasion preparations have now been completed. The German High Command seems to have some clear evidence of the urgency of the invasion operation. Berlin also speculates from meteorological conditions that the enemy army will begin landing operations within a few weeks. Currently, German air force reconnaissance teams are conducting reconnaissance activities day and night.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Scientific Iceberg Discovered in English Channel <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – There have recently been reports that the German army used the most extremely cold chemicals to obstruct the transportation of anti-Axis military supplies. In the past, the German propaganda radio station to Britain falsely broadcast that British coastal guards and scientists had recently discovered large icebergs in the English Channel and the North Sea off the coast of Holland, which greatly surprised them. This is because a secret liquid medicine containing new chemical drugs can generate an extremely cold temperature of 360 degrees below Fahrenheit at the point of contact. Within a distance of 500 yards, it can generate a cold temperature below the freezing point, within which anything will die immediately.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuter's News Agency reports: Washington news: US Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Britain and America are currently negotiating with Turkey and Spain. Regarding news from Turkey, Turkey has stopped shipping news to Germany. Hull did not comment.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuter's News Agency reports: The Swedish newspaper reported that Turkey's decision to stop purchasing supplies to Germany seems to have increased Britain's desire to strengthen its pressure on neutral countries. The London Times reported that the governments of countries that have not yet participated should take Turkey as a model. A Swedish newspaper correspondent in London said that authoritative sources believe that pressure on neutral countries must be increased. The newspaper published an article by Labor Party Member Nicholson, etc., which does not conform to official views. He opposes putting pressure on neutral countries, but qualified people said that the use of pressure on Turkey has been successful and has not affected British-Turkish relations.</p>
<p>Germany Remains Silent</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioglu announced on the 20th that Turkey had stopped exporting military supplies to Germany. The German government authorities avoided expressing their views on this. Before the telegram from the German ambassador to Turkey arrived, the Foreign Office also adopted a cautious attitude and refused to express any opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Indian Liberation War - Observations from German Newspapers <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army and the Indian people's entry into India is the first step in the Indian liberation war. The time when Britain cannot but liquidate its three hundred years of exploiting India has finally come. German newspapers have recently reported in detail on the development of the new Indian front line issued by Tokyo, and have paid extraordinary attention and anticipation.</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Zeitung stated: "The war has moved to India itself," and praised the war results of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army as follows:</p>
<p>Unfolding the Decisive Battle of Liberation</p>
<p>"The war results of the Japanese and Indian armies are worthy of praise, only because they are in mountainous areas and the enemy uses all favorable situations to engage in defense. The Japanese and Indian armies have not wavered in the southern India-Burma region campaign led by Mountbatten, and the British army has suffered extremely heavy damage in this area. The so-called invasion of Burma, which was heavily publicized, is even slower than the British and American troops on the Southern Italy front. The Japanese and Indian armies are attacking India itself at a location 400 kilometers northeast of this area, so this area has long lost the possibility of developing the battle. How the Japanese and Indian armies will proceed with their attack on India in the future is still difficult to say today, but the decisive battle of liberation is now unfolding in India, which is probably certain. How cruelly and ruthlessly Britain dominates India, and how weak and powerless it is now, can be understood from the famine in Bengal.</p>
<p>On April 6, the "Börsen-Zeitung" stated in its commentary as follows:</p>
<p>"Although the British elite troops have tried their best to defend, the Japanese army and the Indian National Army have finally overcome the geographical obstacles of this mountainous area in a relatively short period of time and attacked India. This shows how skillful the Japanese and Indian armies are in combat and how tenacious their fighting spirit is. The Japanese and Indian armies' invasion of India not only annihilated a large part of the British army and a part of the American army, but Britain also lost the last chance to recapture Burma. The fiercely fought battle for strongholds that has been repeatedly launched for several months has thus become a major decisive battle.</p>
<p>Breaking Britain's Incendiary Propaganda</p>
<p>Britain, which has wantonly exploited India for over a hundred years, cannot but defend its lifeline in India itself. Britain's Indian policy has been to defend the chastity of India from external threats for decades, but it has finally collapsed. British propaganda says that Japan aims to conquer India, but no Indian will believe this. Prime Minister Tojo declared that Japan has no territorial or other ambitions towards India, but only wants to liberate the Indian nation. This statement shattered Britain's incendiary propaganda.</p>
<p>A few months after Chandra Bose formed his National Army, he went to the front line, which should be very satisfying. On the road to Delhi, extremely great sacrifices must still be paid, and they are the goal aspired to by the entire Indian people. Bose will surely realize the restoration of "the freedom of the motherland"." (Sho: April 12 West Asahi Shinbun)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Outside the port of Sevastopol, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and the German transport fleet are still engaged in a fierce naval battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – Transocean News Agency reports: The German army's evacuation operation in the Sevastopol area of Crimea is proceeding rapidly, allowing the Soviet army to also make rapid progress. Other than that, the Soviet army's progress elsewhere in the southern route in the fourth week of April is not as rapid as in the past. The Soviet army has repeatedly tried to expand its bridgehead downstream of the Dniester River, but there are no major changes on the front line. The German defense line north of Chisinau can also resist the Soviet army's attack. The Soviet army failed to attack the Danube River in two directions. The Soviet army between the Prut and Siret rivers continued to advance southward, attempting to reach the area north and northwest of Iasi and encircle the German army's flanks. The situation in the area has not changed in the past seven days. The Soviet army advancing from northern Moldavia and eastern Bukovina to the Carpathian Mountains has been repelled, and the pressure of the German-Hungarian coalition forces' counteroffensive has increased. The Hungarian army driving straight down from the Jablunkov Pass captured Nadworna. At the same time, the German-Hungarian coalition forces' counteroffensive in Stanislawow is proceeding extremely smoothly, and the Soviet army is gradually being driven out of the Carpathian Mountains. After the German army in Tarnopol broke through the encirclement, the situation in Lemberg became more stable. There are only local battles in the Kovel-Brody area. Although the Soviet army's offensive in Southeastern Europe has come to a standstill at the end of the week, the Soviet army has not yet reached the point of exhaustion, so the cessation of the offensive is only temporary. The Soviet High Command is currently busy deploying troops, transferring new forces, and waiting for the troops on the Crimean front to gain free action in order to launch another offensive.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) – According to anti-Axis front line news: The German army has recently used "manned torpedoes" on the Italian front line, posing a great threat to the anti-Axis forces' supply route to the port of Anzio. The structure of the "manned torpedo" is quite similar to a small submarine, about twelve feet long, and the same size as the upper part of an ordinary torpedo. It is made of steel, and a navy soldier lies on it, monitoring the movements of enemy ships from a glass window.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Trade Control Council Announces Free Buying and Selling of Gold, Ministry of Finance Formally Replied to the Council Last Year <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Economic Review in the Xinwen Bao had an article on "The Legality of Gold Transactions," which raised doubts about whether gold could be bought and sold freely, and how prices were determined. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter specifically asked the Trade Control Council. It was understood that when the Executive Yuan issued the "Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth" and the implementation guidelines in August of last year, it stipulated that half of the price should be calculated at the fixed price of 40,000 yuan per gold bar (ten taels). The Trade Control Council, considering that there had been a proposal to nationalize the gold bars, and whether the gold bars paid in the future could be bought and sold freely, and whether there would be any restrictions on prices, specifically requested the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance formally replied to the Council, stating: "The nationalization of gold has not been implemented. The cotton and cloth merchants who receive the gold bars can buy and sell them freely, and there is no need to restrict prices." This information was also publicly notified, and all newspapers published it on October 7th of last year, so there is no doubt that gold can be bought and sold freely.</p>

<p>The temporary cotton cloth rationing in this city was originally scheduled to be sold in mid-month. According to the reporter, the cloth purchase certificates printed by the Trade Control Council have long been stamped with secret marks by the contracting merchants, and were sent to the city government by the Council on the 10th of this month, requesting that they be distributed to citizens for collection. It is reported that the city government replied to the Trade Control Council on the 19th, stating: "The letter has been approved, and 3,096,000 cloth purchase certificates have been inspected and received for distribution. Approved, in addition to ordering the Bureau of Economic Affairs to send personnel to collect them, handle them carefully and report back, and ordering the First and Second Police Bureaus to quickly investigate and report the exact number of people in this city to be transferred, a corresponding reply is hereby sent, hoping that you will check accordingly." Then, the temporary cloth distribution in this city must wait until the Bureau of Economic Affairs issues the cloth purchase certificates before a public announcement of the sale can be scheduled. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Merchants Association, the temporary cloth distribution in this city can begin to be sold universally from the 1st of next month, and the authorities will distribute the cloth purchase certificates to citizens in full this month.</p>
<p>Matters Requiring Attention by Retail Cloth Stores</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Cotton Cloth Stores Wholesale Joint Business Office issued a notice to all retail cotton cloth stores, stating: "We hereby inform you that this office is undertaking the temporary cotton cloth rationing affairs in this city, which will be implemented on a regular basis. The matters requiring attention are listed below: All kinds of cotton cloth should be sold at the approved rationing price, and no pretexts should be used to collect extra fees. Each certificate should be sold with 1 zhang 5 chi of cotton cloth, and no less. No broken pieces of cloth should be mixed in for sale. It should be handled in accordance with the 'Shanghai Special Municipality Measures for Undertaking Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing' and the 'Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor's Notice for Purchasing Temporarily Rationed Cotton Cloth'. When selling, try to maintain order as much as possible, such as having certificate holders line up and purchase in batches. All of the above points should be followed by your store. If violations are reported by various parties, this office will report them to the relevant authorities for separate handling. This matter concerns the rationing policy, so please do not neglect it.

<p>For the second phase of household coal briquette rationing in Zhabei, the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs had previously reported that there were not enough coal briquette purchase certificates, so a small number of citizens had not been able to receive them.

<p>After the supply of edible salt became unbalanced, citizens were severely threatened, and the long-prepared "per capita allocation" has not been implemented to this day. The market price in this city has risen sharply, with each city catty priced at 15-16 yuan. According to the person in charge of the Zidian Store Industry Association: At present, the organization responsible for selling and allocating edible salt urgently needs to be adjusted. The "Yuhua Temporary Company" and the "Longchang Official Salt Store," the outside world cannot understand the outline of all their measures on a regular basis. In the past, there were about 1,620 Zidian salt stores operating throughout the city, and 38,000 dan of Zidian salt were allocated each month, which could still supply sales to each store. However, more than 1,500 stores have been gradually disqualified from selling, and only about 120 stores are currently selling Zidian salt, still allocating according to the original quota in Shanghai, with each store receiving between five and twenty-five bags, and allocating twice, and the black market is becoming more rampant. All sectors do not understand the details, and there is a lot of complaints on this page, suspecting that this industry is engaged in hoarding and profiteering. I have no choice but to appeal to the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Ministry of Justice and Administration, the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Welfare, the Municipal Party Department, the New National Movement Promotion Association Shanghai Branch, the First District Office and other powerful agencies, and various community organizations to investigate the truth and adjust the allocation agency as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Public Stability Is the True Foundation of Self-Stability - Pan Guanggen <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The concept of Shanghai people has now become petty egoism, only caring about their own enjoyment, regardless of the life and death of others. Therefore, the consumer industry is particularly developed, and public undertakings are difficult to nurture. For example, the fundraising for the recently established Police Consumer Cooperative is said to be performing poorly. This is a cause for local security. How important is this project to the safety of citizens? Especially for those with property, it is even more important than for ordinary people. Yet, millions of Shanghai citizens seem to have no enthusiasm for it. It is said that a certain bank manager even holds an opposing attitude, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>The bank manager does not want no police and welcome thieves to patronize him, nor does he want to rob others himself without the police after him. To be honest, this manager, if he doesn't know how to gather sand into towers and shirk responsibility, only knows that making money is his own skill, and of course, he will spend it himself. As for the fact that others don't have enough to spend, that's none of his business. Little does he know that what he eats is cultivated from other people's fields, what he lives in is built by others, and what he wears is woven by others. Without others, even with money, one cannot indulge in pleasure. As the saying goes: "People cannot survive alone, detached from society." Knowing this, those with money should also think of those without money. They should not only plan for themselves at all times, but also often consider the safety of the public's property and lives. The issue of the stability of the police's livelihood is, of course, something that the public should consider and resolve for them.</p>
<p>The money-worshipping Jews, with their ability to manipulate finance and trade for profit, are unmatched by any other nation. However, they uniquely lack a sense of place and a national ideology, leading to the loss of their homeland and the destruction of their state. They are forced to wander around the world, carrying burdens, being rejected everywhere, with no place to be accommodated and no place to call home. Their spiritual suffering is probably ten times greater than that of the ordinary people of Shanghai. Having money but no land also cannot bring stability or happiness. The Jews can serve as a cautionary tale for the wealthy of Shanghai. In short, in the current environment of Shanghai, and even the entire nation, it is impossible to only care about oneself and disregard others. It is also impossible to have money without thought. Therefore, if we have food to eat, we must also hope that everyone has food to eat. Only when the stability of the entire nation is achieved can we truly consider ourselves stable.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Banning Opium, Gambling, and Dance Halls; Promoting Compulsory Education <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since the Bureau of Justice implemented the ban on opium, gambling, and dance halls, social figures have universally applauded it. Eliminating years of poisoning in one fell swoop is certainly something that virtuous gentlemen are happy to hear.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Civilian Compulsory School on Zhaojia Road in the Nanshi area has been operating for nearly a week, sparing no effort in teaching children from poor families and achieving significant results. It has recently been reported that the founder of the school, in order to fundamentally eliminate the residual thoughts of those with weak wills regarding opium, gambling, and dance halls, and to eradicate the bad habits of young people being numbed by such陋習, is seizing the moment to actively promote compulsory education and expand the scope of the school. Furthermore, it was recently presented to the Police Bureau Chief of the city who is also the Southern District Commander of the Youth Corps, [omitted] Yingwei as the President, to lead the project, and to allocate funds to supplement [omitted], in order to disseminate enlightenment education, popularize the civilian population, and thereby reform corrupt behavior and foster a thrifty spirit. Therefore, starting from the next semester, it has been decided to strengthen the义敎 structure, focus on four types of training, and strive to promote the New National Movement. In addition to waiving books, fees, and tuition for children from poor families, it will also provide meals and accommodation for homeless children.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Navy <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"This is the naval cemetery,"</p>
<p>We requested that the car stop there.</p>
<p>A tall, white stone monument surrounded by large trees. Inscribed on it were the words "Spirits of the Three Realms." From such ancient words, it can also be known that the cemetery has a long history. In the Meiji 16th year (1883), when the training ship of the Naval Academy anchored in this place, several people died of beriberi, so they were buried here. These were the victims of a time when naval medicine was not yet developed.</p>
<p>We reverently lowered our heads before our predecessors.</p>
<p>In any case, Honolulu is a place with an extremely close connection to the navy. Honolulu is also the place where Katsu Kaishu anchored with the Kanrin Maru. It was also this place where Admiral Togo, as the captain of the Naniwa, protected the pioneer team of Japanese youths, showing the prestige of the warship to the local military and political authorities.</p>
<p>And the vigorous handwriting of the admiral himself is engraved on the Loyalty Tablet, which also stands on the distributed site.</p>
<p>We came to Hawaii and thought of Admiral Togo, which was truly an unexpected thing, but in our hearts, another meaning of the Empire's Navy and the fateful relationship with the area was melted away.</p>
<p>(IX)</p>
<p>The shaved ice eaten in the refreshment pavilion at Waikiki Beach was very delicious; its beauty had a sense of otherworldly paradise.</p>
<p>Climbing Diamond Head, strolling in the Mina Lrua Park, the extremely delicious jackfruit planted in the Japanese farm, the swimming of the local residents, all left a deep impression in our hearts.</p>
<p>The Honolulu's poverty that was felt when first entering the port, and the impressions after landing, were completely different. Even without stepping into the opulent Royal Hawaiian Hotel operated by Americans, the abundance of American material wealth could be felt on all the streets. Due to the blessings of climate, environment, and material wealth, all the residents of all races were all medicine heaven and earth, comfortably, amiably, talking and laughing, walking.</p>
<p>(This should be enough to be satisfied!)</p>
<p>We thought in our hearts and envied their happiness.</p>
<p>The day when everything was unforgettable as the greatest impression finally arrived. A card came from the Schofield Barracks US Army, inviting the training fleet. On the surface, it was holding a parade, and holding a flower garden banquet, according to the situation at the time, its purpose was naturally to demonstrate the power of the day.</p>
<p>The automobile of the fleet commander was driving in the front, and following closely behind was the many vehicles of the non-commissioned officers and candidates that the American Army had lent to them. The long automobile procession, rushed out of the city of Honolulu, and ran straight to the side of Oahu.</p>
<p>On the way, we saw the bizarre scenic spot of Nu'uanu Pali. It is said to be the ancient battlefield of Kamehameha the Great. In the middle of such a deep valley of 断产绝, along the automobile highway, going forward, there was indeed a surprising and distant view. Suddenly, when the sea appeared in front of us, our hearts throbbed. Perhaps there is no need for a waiter to introduce the reasons. In a moment, the automobile convoy ran from the highlands to the plains of sugarcane and jackfruit fields. The green sea surface, like a verdant lawn, and the beautiful and majestic mountains, appeared in front of us. We could also see Ford Island, which looked like a large pot covered with a small lid.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Recruitment of Trainees <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
