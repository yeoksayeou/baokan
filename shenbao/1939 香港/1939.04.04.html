<h3>湘贛戰局展望</h3>
<p>【長沙特約航訊】自三月十八日起，贛北×軍開始以折精路爲鵠的之攻擊。由修河中游的若溪以西以迄河口的吳城，全綫展　劇戰。截至三月底止，在虬津永修間的狗頭嶺强渡修河的×主方部隊，已攻陷南昌、其　　部隊，則在坦克的掩護之下，於蓮塘，沙埠潭，三江口一帶，與我相持。南昌是贛北重鎮，湘東的門戶，且於東南和西南之運絡上，佔有重要地位、所以相信我們必在不久將來，來個人反攻的。</p>
<p>在×人方面、攻略南昌、實際上却是一種不必要，浪費。—這就是他爲日麼仕佔領九江武昌之後，直到　在方開始進攻南昌的原因。一年多以　的大規模的戰爭敎訓了他們：使他們知道中戰的野載軍存在一天，中國决然有一天，擊滅他們；血中國的野戰軍是正在加强和擴大之中，他們想要殲滅它，將永遠是一個夢想。於是他們想到：中國的國際交通綫一日不袖切斷，中國决然有仗義的友人會在物質上予以更充分的援助。從×入佔領海南島之後，加緊建築防禦工事，闢建機埸倉庫，以及在豫晉綏方面積極增加援兵，企業肅淸後方等種種情况看來，他們確在作切斷我西南和西北的國際交　綫的準備。假如×人以全部的力量安放在這一個策略上，那倒未始不是一件植得注意的事。</p>
<p>但×人是一個資本短少的冒險商人，也是一個在家　到處搜括，用來作孤注一　的無賴賭徒，他沒有那麼大的資本去做那慶大的冒險：他手裏拿着一筆東拚西湊來的小　錢，走進賭埸就不知押在那一門才　。一個冒險商人或無賴賭徒，對於當前的情况總視爲千載一時，焦灼有萬一錯過了，就再沒有賺錢或賭錢的機會。但世界上沒有致富的冒險商人和賭錢的無賴徒是人所共和的。</p>
<p>國際的風雲，國內的實況，以及中國作着無休止的戰爭的百禹士兵，使日本×閥比一個冒險　人或無頓賭徒更性急和濂灼起來。尤其是對於國內的人民和遠征的士兵、在佔領武漢和廣州兩個空了的城市的五個月後，他們必得再找一些相當刺激的東西來安慰　搖的人心，提高萎靡的士氣。於是，他們在鄂中一度活動　壁之後，又選中了南昌。其實，假如他從鄂中集中全力向西突進，也許有可能踏到荊沙或宜昌的土地，不管從此就沒有冉前進，而祗有後退的機會，倒也可以大言不慚地對國內作『皇軍』現徐中國首都重慶僅若干　羅米突」之類的聳人宜傳了。</p>
<p>那麼南昌呢？</p>
<p>南昌和長沙，武昌，這三點幾乎可構成一個等邊三角形，×人已佔領武昌，南昌，我們在失掉兩個角以後，要守禦長沙這一個角，自然有相當困難。串而在九江，岳陽，長沙和南昌這四　構成的平行四邊形裏，雄踞　造物者賜給我們的天然堡壘——幕阜山。它一方而突破了武昌，　江和岳陽之間的特角之勢，妨碍了　江岳陽間的聯絡，同時虎視着武昌，一方面可以居高臨下的姿態，由修河兩岸的山地威脅　南　的中腰，這一座介於湘鄂續一省邊區的偉大　深的山嶺，容納一二上萬軍隊是看不見的。它進可主動地們擊圍環在它北東南三面的各據點，退足保存實力，掩　三湘。所以×人雖佔領南昌，切斷了浙贛，徒使深人內　錯誤更深刻化，陷了四面受敵的泥淖，破壞了多少還能從　州海口偷運到內地來銷售的日貨市場……當着他面前的，是更廣大的「陸海」，更高深的山地，他們沒有更大的人力、物力和財力來控制更大的戰場，保　更長的戰綫，據守更多的據點。</p>
<p>從戰衛上說，×人擴大湘贛戰場也是一種錯誤。×人的作戰已遠超出他們的原定計劃，×人陸軍的配備是平原戰的，理想的戰區是長城以外、河北、山東，河南，也曾凖備沿海作戰，因此有相當數量的登陸的特種部隊、害實在左沒有想到會和中國作山地戰。他們雖也有二三個（至多四個）山地戰配備的師團，但在武漢會戰時已在贛　和皖鄂的山地戰中消耗殆盡。從最　的戰利品中，發現地們所甩的江西湖南—尤其是湖南——的地圖、和在蘇，浙，冀，魯時所用的地圖比較，詳簡相　很遠。他們現正犯着孫子所稱「善用兵者致人，而不致於人」的「致於人』的錯誤</p>

<h3>紀念兒童節</h3>
<p>兒童是國家未來的主人，是世界未來命運的决定者，世界各國對於兒童事業，亦都作爲重大的國家事業之一，而年年兒童節日紀念情形，更爲熱烈。我國過去，內憂外患，交相煎迫，兒童事業，未受重視。中華慈幼協會有鑒及此，於民國二十年三月七日，呈准國府，明定每年陽春蓬勃的四月四日爲兒童節，屆時全國舉行紀念，迄今已歷八年。但是過去多爲例行紀念，對于眞正有利于兒童的事業，似少具體計劃，更鮮值得稱道的行動。祇有全面抗戰展開以後，去年的兒童節，在婦女領袖宋美齡先生倡導之下，噓召全國，努力於戰時兒童事業，如關於兒童保育工作，已有保育會的組織，初步進行亦尚順利，至於難童救濟及敎養問題，亦經最高領袖蔣委員長一再申令地方政府注意。不過一年來戰區擴大，囘顧保育兒童的工作，則仍遠落於需要之後，所以紀念今年兒童節，我們不能不想到正在日×炮火槍刀之下的戰想到淪區兒童，他們遭受着飢寒，流離，旗死亡！我們不能不陷區的兒童，他們遭受着欺凌，×××××××××我們更不能不想到廣大的祖國各地的兒童，他們顚沛！流浪！他們喪失了家園！他們看不見爹娘，在這樣一個新的形勢之下，我們紀念兒童節的緊急任務，第一是要加緊搶救戰區和淪陷區內我們的兒童的工作。第二是要擴大推行保育我們民族後代，保育新中國主人的工作。我們要一刻不容延緩地把戰區及其附近的兒童，輸送到安全地帶，到較遠的後方，免受×人的摧殘轟炸。我還要運用多種多樣的辦法去展開淪陷區內反×反漢奸的鬥爭，盡一切可能去救濟組織和敎育淪陷區內的兒童。我們要把從戰區救出及原徐後方的兒童，有計劃地實行調查，登記；編組，分遣，保障他們的物質生活，實施正確的適要的精神敎育，利用他們的一切可能，以增加抗戰的力量（如上海抗戰中童子軍協助軍隊及孩子劇團的旅行全國，從事宣傳）。以培養未來建設三民主義新中國的基本人材。</p>
<p>爲要完善達到我們當前種種迫切的要求；我們必須立刻努力於以下幾種目前必須實行的工作：</p>
<p>政府方面，應該進一步認淸目前救濟難童保育兒童的重大意義，用法令及其他滴要的方法，帮助戰時兒童保育會及其他熱心保育兒童事業者，加帮助運輸戰區兒童，撥給需用房舍供給衣食需要，廣徵兒科醫生及護士藥品，實施適應抗戰的難童敎育等，政府過去已經盡力，今後更應普遍的加緊進行。</p>
<p>民衆方面，應該認淸目前救濟難童保育兒童，具有減少民族犧牲減少自己犧牲和保證我們民族的未來生命的重大意義，是我們全體中華兒女當前的天職，所以我們男女各界，尤其是有組織的羣衆團體，要立刻努力帮助政府，就自己範　，切實做起，集中財力人力，擴大保育運動。特別是海外僑胞，應該爲此而擴大慕捐運動，擴大徵募醫藥運動。</p>
<p>國際方面，我們要擴大宣傳工作，一面以具體材料暴露日×殘害我兒童婦女的眞相，增加國際對××的×愾，一面說明保育中國離童，對於保證中國抗日勝利建國成功以至保障世界和平的重要意義，以取得國際人士對我的同情旗援助。蘇聯和英美各國，曾先後以物質援助西班牙的離童，蘇聯等國的工人羣衆與全世界和平正義人士，並曾分別保育了西班牙成千成萬的難童，便是很好的例子。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要努力培養保育兒童的專門人才，希望富有的同胞，協助政府創辦保育兒童　幹部訓練學校，大量供給這種專門人材。其他具有醫藥看護的學識旗經騐的，最好能够以國民精神總動員的精神，熱烈地自動投効。</p>
<p>我們要爭求民族解放，必須救濟及保育我們民族的後代，我們爲建設新的中國而堅持抗戰，我們更必要爲救濟及保育新中國的未來主人而堅决努力。而且也只有擴大救濟及保育兒童，才能使我們戰士安心作戰，工人安心作工，農民安心務農，婦女亦可因而免去兒女的牽累，參加抗戰建國的工作。全中國不願做奴隸的男女同胞，我們要合作起來，認眞的担負起歷史給我們的保育兒童的任務，新中國的主人，要在槍林彈雨的血戰中滋長與壯大！</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>日×屈服了！</h3>
<p>三日路透社　　　　，蘇日漁　糾紛，經已獲得完滿解决，兩國　　漁　　己訂立，期限爲一年。這次蘇日漁約之設立，可注　的有　國設點。</p>
<p>第一。是說明日×對　聯全部屈服。囚爲日×原來要　蕪。原有漁約繼續有　，而這次新約，却使日×不碍不放棄三十　個漁區，而由蘇聯依軍事上理由，另行指定十重區域，並日還要目×償付校前增加百分之！的租稅　過去日方宣稱不達延展漁約不惜一戰，現在演出了屈膝的事買</p>
<p>第二，是證明了蘇聯和平政策的成功，不僅使日×不能不俯首就範，而且使天下都能認識日×色厲內荏的醜態！</p>
<p>第三，學證明了，自從張鼓雄一役慘遭失敗以修，日×確無進攻蘇聯的勇氣了，一方面可見日×不能同時進行對華對蘇的戰爭，但另一方面却要當心至後日人必見以全力企圖首先「降服」中國，我們要當心他們軍事冒險政治分裂和外交誘降的毒計！</p>
<h3>偽中央的陰謀</h3>
<p>××漢奸一切和平妥協與組織偽中英政府的陰謀，是隨着×人國內與軍隊的困繡而存在，而作止　例的發展的。當此×入在政治上軍事上外交上的困難愈趨嚴重之時，這柿陰謀也就愈演愈烈。這幾天接着和平妥協的空氣，又來了偽中央陰謀的再度沽。</p>
<p>據一日海通社上海電，「×入漢奸劉於汪精衛發表「舉一個例」的聲明，以保留他個人有與日本本直接談判的權利一事，表現十分注意，但汪精衛的這個聲明，適與英駐日大使行將蒞滬興徐駐華大使會談之時，尤為×奸　意。另一方面，北平重南京偽政府，刻正盼望戰事之能及早結東。傳二偽府曾建議設立一偽新中央政府，以汪爲總理』。這個消息，已經部份地透露了×奸最近的政治陰。</p>
<p>事實很明顯，我們祗有堅持團結學持抗戰才有勝利，×人使用反共與和平，來破壞我團續阻止我抗戰；我　祗有誠意擁護領袖擁護中央，才能有最貧勝利，×人使用一切手段來桃撥　間，並且企圖製造偽中央政府，以　我國的滅亡。現在南北傀儡政府和注精衛的活動，便正是×人計劃的部份表現。</p>
<p>我們爲　國家獨立民族解放，不僅要　持團結抗戰擁護領袖與政府，並且還應堅決反對任何和平妥協國際調解，並且還要盡力打擊任伺漢奸傀儡政權，能才戰勝×人，獲得最後勝利！</p>

<p>××××　擄刦兼施</p>
<p>據在××××每面遭禍之船主曾祥生（卅一歲）囘港報稱、其所屬船乃在港註冊、號　爲T一二四日號、其所經營則爲運輸貨物工作、當去月十二日、在港應貨客之顧、滿載貨物、（約值三千元）、停泊于××××海面、正擬繼續啟碇之際、突有一×濟艇由東鼓浪面來、闖進××、將迫近該貨艇時、　出×水兵十餘名、蜂擁躍該貨艇、卽露械將各人威懾制服、幷令一水兵以槍指嚇舵工、逼令將船駛出華界林西渡海面、停泊一星期之久，×又轉拖往廣州、將船上廿餘人、驅登岸上、迫使充當快役、曾祥生瞷×兵疏防之際、卽乘機逃脫、昨日始返本港向　署報案、×兵此次闖進××××、肆行向民船搜刦、殊屬罔恤國際公法也、</p>

<h3>本報為紀念兒童節　獻給小朋友的禮物　從上海本報運到大批精神食糧</h3>
<p>精神食糧是進步的人們的生活要素。眞正的要引起兒童的興趣，眞正的要鼓勵兒童向上，眞正的要使兒童成爲將來國家民族的主人翁，除了贈送畫報給兒童，指導兒童閱讀兒宣讀物之外，還有什麼再好的辦法呢？</p>
<p>假如是一個賢明的父母或長輩，他會明白給小孩子吃得好，穿得好，「愛之　足　之」；唯有以兒童書報附選兒童才是最好的辦法。</p>
<p>今天是小朋友最歡騰的兒童節。大人們是照例要來替小主人做生日的。但是，難題立刻擺在眼前了：</p>
<p>看電影吧，放毒的電影是不該給大眞無瑕的孩子看的；糖果，玩具吧，想到難童生　那　凄凉的圖畫，稍有良心的，一定會覺得非節約不可；書報吧，飛簽走壁的連環圖固然是毒藥，就是書坊上那些「說古人話」的，與「說大人話』的讀物亦畢竟不是兒童所需要的精神食糧。那麼，今天見童節除帶兒童參加紀念會，講些愛國故事之外、將爲兒童　些　麼呢？</p>
<p>要是爲了有所顧忌，爲了實行節約而　有恩物給兒童，　兒童白白　空過這一天，不消說，孩子們是非常失望的。假如他是乖點的話，他或她一定要詰問大人與長輩：『愛護兒童！這是騙人的話！請問給我們兒童些什麼好處？』</p>
<p>難題擺在有心的父母與長輩之前，將如何解决得好　？</p>
<p>帶兒童袖書局購買有益的兒童讀物固然是一個辦法，此外還有一個喜訊是讀者聽了之後，一定會興奮起來的。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>上海　報每星期日專爲兒童出版有『兒童週刊』，四年鏽直到現在，還是繼續出版。因爲撰稿者都是國內知名的兒童文學作家，所以，一紙風行而成爲國內不可多得的兒童讀物了。賢明的父母與敎師，無不以上海本報的兒童週刊作爲自家兒女或學生的精神食糧。爲便利讀者要求起見，還彙編爲「兒童之友「之精裝單行本。早已成爲著名之兒童讀物。本報爲提高香港兒童文學水準，與皷勵兒童重視課外閱續起見，特從上海本報辦來大批「申報兒童專刊彙編：兒童之友一。同時爲紀念兒童節起見，　再照最低廉的定價打一個對折的優侍。第一集實售港幣二角，第二集實售港幣二角，第三果實售港幣一角。—這僅是收囘印刷費之一部份。</p>
<p>徐書的材料，文宇，圖莊，都是站在兒童本位敎育的觀點上的優良兒童讀物。其內容有：兒童講壇，見童科學，勞作，常識，名人逸話，公民訓練，詩歌，圖畫，兒童文藝，童詁故事，遊藝，生活知識，童子軍信袖，兒童創作等等，每集達十六開本四百員左右，文字容量每集達十餘萬字。它卹以作爲敎師的參考書，又可爲補充敎材，亦是課外的讀物，眞是名副其實的「兒童之友」。要是掏出一二角綫買一本給小朋友，你對於小朋友的希望，無論是愛國的，科學的，修養的，文藝的……一定可以從此踏上光明的祖途。　是本報紀念兒宣節的禮物，爲了提高香港的兒童文學的水準，使我們的次一代健康地生長起來，深願賢明的父母與敎師，立刻以本報之「兒童之友」作爲兒童節送給兒童之恩物。</p>

<h3>救救我們的孩子吧！</h3>
<p>— 郁瓊</p>
<p>兒童節話香港兒童　在熱烈慶祝中請不要忘記貧苦的小朋友</p>
<p>一年一度的兒童節是隨着和暖的春天到臨了，在這個有重大意義的節日當中，我們知道有着許多幸福的小朋友，正在熱烈地舉行慶祝，開會呀，演講呀，遊藝呀，在換贈呀，是怎樣的快樂和活潑。然而，我們亦要知道，除了這一小部份的幸福兒童外，還有多少不幸的貧苦兒童，斗室裏，在工廠中，在十字街頭，在騎樓底下，在生活的掙扎下，在惡劣的環境尋，怎樣的慘苦和悽愴。而且這些數量，是比那幸福的兒童是不知多少倍的。這亦是將來國家民族的主人翁，我們熱烈的紀念中，是不能忘記的。</p>
<p>我把不願一開口便骯髒的一羣小孩子帶到讀者面前，令到讀者縐起回頭，歎着氣，就以一般的中上階級的孩子說起吧，這已經够令人感喟了！</p>
<p>「寸金尺土一，一層樓住着二三十人，在選樣的環境下，香港孩子的健康已經受了根本的搖動，我門看吧在中等人家的孩子中，有幾個是自已一間房，甚至到自己一張床的呢？交母子五四五人一張床，兄弟「孖舖」，姊妹連床比比皆是。</p>
<p>住旣然是這樣，吃呢？未必比住好得多，生活程度這麼高，市民先生們要繳高到無可最高，而事實上，業丰「大人」還隨時可以增高的屋租；要應酬，要撑小市民的場面；要穿漂亮衣服……在重軍負担不，還能够特別注意小孩子們吃麼？大人吃什麼，孩子就吃什麼罷了，營養不營養，誰管得了呢。</p>
<p>街頭　賣，廉價的劣零吃害了我門不知多少孩子！</p>
<p>衣，除了少數貴族些的人家的孩子們，打扮得美麗一點之外，大體來說都很貧乏，能够整潔，許適的書在不多。</p>
<p>行嗎？天呀！每年香港有多少孩子，無辜的孩子，在馬路上給汽車輾傷，撞死呢？我們祗知道「馬路如虎口，」爲什麼我們任由「市虎」　走亂闖呢？難道有車階級，有車階級的僕人—汽車佚，是特殊的嗎？</p>
<p>衣·食·住·行之外便到學校，一層雜在一住家種」中的普通住樓，黑板是黑色，檯椅是黑色……昏昏黑黑中，四五十個小孩子便　在一起念着「子曰學……』寫着「上大人……」</p>
<p>小小一層樓是敎室，是遊戲場……什麼也是它了。規模較大的學校亦不過一闢『騎樓」作兵乓球室，兼圖書室，有天合作操塲而已，香港的這般華貴舒適的團院茶館，酒館……卻有這般　陋的學校。</p>
<p>這樣的環境中，我們的未來主人翁，我們的小天使的生活，啊！太可憐了！可是，請你還不要歎息，還有一大羣，比上面說過的更可憐更悽慘呢？</p>
<p>一早在街跑着，嚷着：「××報×報，……』的男女孩子，在街市附近—像中環　加咸街，上環街市，灣仔街市，西營盤街市，油蔴　街市……—拿　靑菜，葱，蒜，瓜……向人兜賣的男女孩子，他（她）們都是『猴形』『菜色』，衣衫襤褸，很骯髒的一羣，從早到晚，跑着　着，最幸運的一天，不過賺得三幾角錢。</p>
<p>我們都知吧！他（她）們幹的勾當是「犯法」的，因爲沒有領牌照，『　公守法」的警察，隨時要將他（她）拘罰，這樣的案件多了，不久以前有一位法官公　討論過。</p>
<p>這樣過慣「犯法」生活的未來主人的市民呢？這是一個嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>在同樣命運下的還有：</p>
<p>擦皮鞋小童，他們都是男童子有十四五歲的有六七歲的，甚至三四歲的也有，拿着一只用爛木履和舊箱板釘成的「擦鞋箱」，兩盒鞋膏，一技舊矛刷，幾條破布，蹲在街頭去討生活。</p>
<p>兩個銅板擦一對鞋，一天擦得二三十對，本來可以賺得四角多錢的，可是這樣找　吃的人太多了，香港九龍合，，最少有二千五百多人，「僧多粥少」一個銅板擦一對鞋，也有人幹，很多整天也找不到一角錢呢！</p>
<p>晚上，舞場門口多有一羣「單衣薄片，」面色青白，拖着一條黃毛小辯子的女孩子們，拿着襟頭花向為尋開心而來的紳士兜賣，她們都在北風裏打顫，不知幾幸運才得一個舞客垂憐給她一個五仙鎳幣，要一朵襟頭花。</p>
<p>小乞兒多得很呢，滿面骯髒，垂着兩直黃鼻涕光着屁股，赤了脚的四五歲乞兒，在每一間戲院，餐室，百貨公司……門繡都可以看到。</p>
<p>十二時後的深夜，大酒店，大舞廳門前，不少，這樣的乞兒，在地上打着跟斗，連續地一路打去，趕着貴客乞錢。。在都市最骯髒，最僻黯的角落裏。在飢餓線上有十多萬可憐的小孩子生活着。</p>
<p>他（她）們是禾來的主人翁，這是沒有人能够否認的，我們爲什麼忍心讓我們的未來主人翁遇着這般可憐的生活呢。讓魯迅告訴我們：—</p>
<p>『救救孩子吧』！</p>

<h3>中國戰時兒童保育會工作報告</h3>
<p>一　成立經過</p>
<p>自全面抗戰開始以來，戰區日益擴穴，×徐所至。廬舍爲墟，我們衛國將七的遺孤及災區的幼童，或被×人據殺，或受饑寒而死。此外流離失所的，缺臂斷足的，隨處都是，其尤慘的，有許多年紀較幼未受過敎育的兒宣，都被×人運到後方，實行其「以華侵華」的毒策，</p>
<p>兒童，乃是國家的命脉所繫，民族的繁榮所關，欲使我同胞減少室家之累，我鬥士無後　之憂，俾達澈民抗戰建國的主張和復興民族的祈求的，那末，自然對此數百萬陷在災區的兒童不能不加以切實的保證與充分的敎養。</p>
<p>本會總會會長宋美齡女士有見及此，特發動全國婦女，設立戰時兒童保育會總會於漢口，收容難童達十餘寓人，並設分會於各省便使就近搶救。</p>
<p>去年四月間本港婦女慰勞會接到總會指令後，當卽激請當地婦女着手籌備，爲時三星期開會凡三次，擬訂簡章，起草宣言，卽於去年五月十一日下午三時宣告成立。照章選舉職員，分組辦事，聘請社會名流爲名譽理事，藉便諮詢，初設辦事處于婦女兵災會，復于去年十一月間改借婦女慰勞會爲本會辦事地點。</p>
<p>竊自成立以來，已歷半年，辱承各界人士的贊助，進行極稱順利，茲值本會將半年來工作情况曁經濟收支編印報告之際，爰略述其成立經過於此。會務報告</p>
<p>會務報告</p>
<p>本會是　去年五月十一日成立的，當時通過了章程後卽席把理事選了出來。</p>
<p>同月十五日開第一次理事會議，推舉常務理事，監察理事，中英文秘書和各委員會正副主任，幷聘請名譽理事，顧間等（名單另詳）卽日開始工作。</p>
<p>從開始工作起，截全現在止，共開過常務理事會議十九次，監察理事會議兩衣，現在把十一個月以來所有的會務分別報告在下面，希望各界熱心的人士加以指導，</p>
<p>二　經費的來源</p>
<p>本來，一個組織開始的時候，有兩個先决的問題，第一是場所問題，第二是開辦費的問題。</p>
<p>關於前的問題，曾由婦女兵災會借給一所房間，作爲辦公之用，總算解决了。關於後的問題，曾由婦女慰勞會捐助港幣二百元，先作開辦費用，總算也解决了。</p>
<p>這兩個先决問題旣經解决，於是我們這個組織，可以　是略略具了柑輪。</p>
<p>五月十九日本會第二次常務會議，議决敦請梅蘭芳博士代本會義務籌款，當承應允，並於同月廿八廿九兩日演劇籌欵，深蒙各界熱心人士竭力帮助，籌得一萬五千餘元，一面由名譽理事担任保育，五名以上的兒童費用，理事担任一名以上的兒童費用，並函請各社　學校贊助，以團體名義祖任五名以上的兒童　用此外私人方面自動捐助的也不在少數，至於捐助物品的，每日亦有　起，這些都是本會經濟的來源，所有　於經濟收支詳細數目，另有經濟委員會報告，這里不多禮了。</p>
<p>三　第一院成立經過</p>
<p>本會旣籌到義欵萬餘元，再加以理事和贊助團體所捐的兒童保秀費萬元左右，共有二萬餘元，於是乃着手設立保育院了，卽於去年六月初分途尋覓地址。</p>
<p>初由廣東省府指撥深圳大酒店房屋一座，地方頗爲寬闊，可序一千人以上，「經一設計」組委員兩次前往勘看之後，都認該屋接近廣　鐵路，時有敵機往來其間，加以年久失修，頗多破漏，修理估計約需六千元，爲安全經濟起見，雖承撥惜，終未敢用，同時，各方熱誠之士，紛紛來函，或願以家祠別墅出惜，或介紹其親友房屋惜用，但或以交通不便，或休毒蚊過多，都未借用，惟對本港人士之熱誠贊助，本會至爲銘感。</p>
<p>後，乃决定借用元朗博愛醫院。該院原爲元朋紳士鄧伯裘，蔡寶出，鄧偉堂，伍華……諸泣先生等所主持的，鄧先生等對於慈管的事業素具熱心，此次慨然允以該院　上全部及樓下客廳讓出，借給本會辦　第一保育院，尤其令人感激。乃於屋旁加蓋消潔室一座，於七月中旬，正式開辦，推何艾齡女士爲院長，綜理一切院務。</p>
<p>該第一院共收容兒童八十三人，內除少數是就香港收容外，大部份都是由難民救濟會　東分會送來的</p>
<p>至於院內用人方旬，　遵照總會主旨，以最經濟卹方法，儘　　用，除看　長一人綜理衛生事　外，其他助理看護，教員，庶務以及工友等，都是一人兼辦數事。所遺憾的，就是限于地方，不能够多多收容，以致向隅者還有很多。</p>
<p>四　第二院成立經過</p>
<p>因爲第一院院址狹小，收容兒童八十餘人，已感過於擁擠，而外界要求繼續收容的還有很多，且自全面抗戰以來，災區日益擴大，本院旣在安全區域，自應多事收容，加以本會所　的五百人計劃本亦袛能作爲第一步的工作，所以第一院雖告成立，而第二院之籌設自不能或緩。</p>
<p>因此，乃於第一院才告成立，同時，卽着手於第二院的院址之尋覓，先會要求政府批　空地十萬尺，連日由土地局當事者領看新界一帶空地達十數處之多，終於新界一帶空地均屬種值之區，毒蚊甚多，其較近九龍之家祠空屋，則以埸所太小，不能多事收容。</p>
<p>去年八月間武漢受，機壓迫，疏散人口，而總會在淪陷區城裏所搶救的難童達數千人，當時爲求安全起見，立卽分送各內地重慶，貴陽，昆明等處，時難童均巳就道，則第二院之設立更屬刻不容緩，而派員護送來的，計有三百五十人，當卒會接到電報時，卽連夜分頭向各方面接洽收容塲所後，承東華醫院總選周兆五先生帶同本會辦事人同赴華民司要求設法，結果允將舊國家醫院B座塡出，借予本會備用。</p>
<p>當該批難童，從武漢動身時係由武　童子軍十人及職員四人護送。他們經過廣州時，承當　婦女慰勞會招待，並蒙加派童軍　送，於去年九月九日淸晨到港。但由漢口到廣州需要求日路程，舟車勞頓已感辛苦，中間加以途中走避警報，數度下軍，以致有身體較弱之，餘人，抵港時都生了病，當時由本會釗站迎接人員，卽刻把他們送往醫院醫治，一面把具他兒童車送到閑書院。該出兒童人數旣多，年歲　大，目均操北方語言，所以除了護送人員之外，所有看護，敎員及　務人員律聘用北方人員，减少隔膜流弊，但在本港物色此項人材，則又屬困難之事，以致該院成立至半個月之久，內部組織方稱就緒。</p>
<p>惟舊國家醫院本是本港政府備爲每年冬季難民露宿會之用，其能够借給本會用的時間，至多不過三個月、而本院永久地址又沒有决定，乃商承港府方面指定接近九龍的鑽石山以爲院址，此事并經本會顧問胡文虎先生同意者，不料交涉結果，又是一個失望，其原因是政府將留作牛乳埸之用。</p>
<p>到了去年十二月間港府因鑽石山不能撥給，允將九龍馬頭涌新建的難民營挨出一部，借給本會作爲第二之用，但此亦，臨時性質，故乃决定要求港府把該難民營右旁的空地一方計九萬尺左右批給自行建築使用，一面幷敦請本會名譽顧問羅旭和，羅文錦，周壽臣三位先徐向港府作有力的接洽，幷承司徒永覺先生從旁贊助，卒於十二月底經　例局正式通過，批借三年期間，幷得轉期至九年。此次本會能得這樣完滿結果，自然是由各位顧問的熱心及港餐對於本會的信任所致，本會應特別感謝的。</p>
<p>五　第三院成立經過</p>
<p>自廣州失守後，新界難民驟增，遺兒棄女，遍衢皆是，乃由第一院看護長和職員隨時搶救，暫留第一院保養，同時其他慈善團體，亦有把棄兒收囘留養的。港府當時以爲各團體分頭收餐，事權旣難集中，保育目難完香，决將該批兒童交與本會辦理。旋由司徒永覺夫人和何艾齡院長接洽結果，由港府再借給舊國家醫院產房一座，卹爲開辦第三阮之用。</p>
<p>第三院開辦後，曾由第一院移來新舊收容的嬰兒一十人，加以慈善團體所送約計七十餘人。</p>
<p>自此，第一院的收容的見童均爲二歲至六歲，第二院定爲穴歲至—四歲，三院則純屬嬰兒。這樣於各院工作上旣感使利，而人力財力亦可經濟許多了。</p>
<p>六　永久院址之籌備經過</p>
<p>以上所說的第一，第二，第三，三院的院址本來都是得着各方的贊助撥借而來的，在此長期抗戰的期間，本會這種工作當然不是暫時的，而目以過去辦理兒童保育院的經驗和效用，大家部認爲有永遠存在和擴充的必要。前承港府批給之九龍馬頭涌難民營右旁的地址本想自　建築備用，惟是時適胡文虎先生來港，以該九龍馬龍頭油萬餘尺的地址，固然頗寬關，但是即有限期，這不但於將來建築費上，沒有保障，而且期限一滿，又要遷移認爲不大妥當，乃即日購得粉嶺上水交界地方的一塊地，約十需三萬餘尺，地價一萬四千元，可收容兒童五百人，現該地旣經胡先生購捐本會，充作建築保育院之用，則本會前　認為第一重要問題的，至此已完全美滿的解决了。</p>
<p>現對建築事情，胡先生已交永安堂辦事者正在計劃中，其中所計劃的有宿舍課室，醫藥室，圖書館，體育場，工埸，農場，禮堂，理科實騐室，沐浴室，廁所等，一俟查勘淸楚，很快的就可以登報招工投票建築了，（將來落成，我們兒童還要向胡先生晉一杯爲壽），本會成立以來不及十一個月，收容兒童達四百餘人，借用院址三處，均承各界人士之熱心贊助。至於此次本會得有永久之院址，則全賴胡文虎先生之據慨捐助，同人等於會務報告之餘，謹　表四百餘難童向各位贊助者致謝！</p>
<h3>紀念兒童節與開展兒童工作</h3>
<p>— 劉慶萱</p>
<p>隨着戰線的延長，戰區的擴大，中國兒童遭受人慘酷的摧殘，也日益增加，因此，救濟難童，保育兒童，是學持持久抗戰的重大任務。</p>
<p>兒童是我們後代的國民，是抗戰到底爭取最後勝利的一支力量，是建造新國的本錢，抗戰以來，我們爲着保育後代的國民，爲着搶救戰區的難童，會經組織了中國兒童保靑會，戰時兒童救濟協會，並且在各地設立分會，這是配合着堅持抗戰的重要的步驟。同時爲着組織兒童的力量，在各地也展開了兒童團體的組織。</p>
<p>但是直到現在，我們這些救濟難童，保育兒童，組織兒宣的工作還遠落在客觀形勞之後，還沒有發揮應有的效能。在今天慶祝中國兒童節的時候，我們應該給予一番檢討，作爲我們今後改進，充實的張本。</p>
<p>首先，我們應該指出的是：兒童工作還沒有發揮應有的　能，不能滿足抗戰形勢的要求，固然是基於整個民族動員還沒有做到適應抗戰的需要，但是兒童工作者的努力還沒有做到應有的程度，却是一個重大的要求。</p>
<p>其次，教濟難童，保育兒童，組織兒童，要有二個統盤的　劃，才能收到重大的效果，目前我們正因沒有統盤的計劃，所以工作還是停滯在浮面和表皮，沒有擴大和深入。</p>
<p>第三，救濟難童，保育兒童，組織兒童，是積極的抗戰工作一部份，而然，有些工作同志，只是把它當爲消極的救濟，而忽視其積極的意義，因此，不能提高工作的效能。</p>
<p>這些不過是我個人感到的缺點，今後我們對於欽濟，保育，組織兒童等工作，應該史有計劃的去推行，提高工作的效能，打破對於見童工作的不正確觀念，只有這樣才能使救濟，保育，糾織兒童的工作，發輝應有的效能。</p>
<p>香港雖是處在火綫以外的地帶，然而由於地理的關係，都是迫近祖國的烽火圈因此，有效　進行求濟難童，保育兒童的工作是我們每個僑胞應有的責任，，我們不但要堅持持久抗戰，發揮我們中華民族地大物博的力量，　，而且要儘一切可能來救濟，保育我們第二代的國民，培袖民族的生機，作爲抗戰建國的資本。</p>
<p>在慶祝兒童節的今天，我們應以戰鬥的姿態來負起搶救難童，保育兒童，進而組織兒童的責任，使　大戰區內的兒童得到救援，同時還向全世界愛好和平的人士呼籲，×××××××××××，援助中國的遭難兒童。這是我們處在火線以外的僑胞們，急應執行的任務！</p>
<h3>怎樣過今年的兒童節</h3>
<p>— 范政</p>
<p>這是最近從國內到港的中國救亡劇團一位小團員的作品，他今手僅有十三歲，原是新安旅行團的團員，抗戰後轉轉長扯內各地，對救亡宜傳工作曾有不少的貢献。在這篇短短的文章中，我們可以看出中國兒童是怎樣在抗戰的炮火中長成，是怎樣和大人們一樣地盡力献身於民族解放的鬥爭！編者</p>
<p>在抗戰當中來過我們自己的節是多麼快活多麼有意義呀！</p>
<p>「兒童節」是我們小孩子自己的節，我們應該想辦法把這個節非常有意義的過去才對。</p>
<p>囘憶起過去的兒童節是亳無意義的，只是開一開會，聽聽大先生們訓導，自己也喊幾个口號，再由學校中買一些糖果，手巾等發給大家樂一樂，就算給這些</p>
<p>『小主人』過了這個節了—我們覺得這樣的給我們過節是沒有意思的？</p>
<p>我們要過一個快快活活的兒童節，就要我們自己來幹，自己把自己的小力量拿出來幹，</p>
<p>瑛在，繡內的小朋友，他們就自已來慶祝兒童節，自己有自己的團體，幷且還有總的兒童團體組織，他們有什麼工作了，許多團體的代表一起開會討論辦法，佈置工作，</p>
<p>就　廣西的桂林來說吧，（我是剛從桂林的兒童團體新安旅行團出來參加中國救亡劇團的）那憂就有七個兒童團體，他們有一個座談會，就是討論怎樣進行工作的；這一次慶祝兒童節，他們一定要大幹一幹。</p>
<p>自己人當主席自己人演劇唱歌，做街頭壁報　漫畫，漫畫，……工作，他們不要什麼糖果，可是，他們工作做起來，比糖果還要甜呢！</p>
<p>在香港這樣一個大都市中，除了學校之外，很少再有一個小朋友的　體了，這要是　　內的小朋友知道，他們一定會發笑的；當然，這是有着特殊的困雞的，但是我們要打破一切的困難，拿出目已的力量。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，香港好像是死氣沉沉的，有些同胞，還在醉生夢死的呢？他們一點都不關心抗戰，有的甚至於像汪精衛—樣的主和，我們小朋友要　成一个小警鐘把這些在夢裏的入喊起來吧！</p>
<p>我們紀念兒童節，一是要化自己組織起來變成中華民族小戰士，跟國內救亡工作小朋友來賽賽，看那個幹的好；兒童節前夕於中國救亡劇團。</p>
<p>電影與戲劇　影人文章</p>
<h3>從「夜光杯」說起</h3>
<p>— 李綺年</p>
<p>我們總知道粵語電影因爲人才和財力的關係，關於技術方面，向自不免隨便些，但因愈隨便而致令那些水準較高的觀衆使愈感失望，因之，一般公司老板總以爲那認眞的觀衆不看粵語片了，更愈隨便去迎合低級觀衆的口味，以致歧途百出于是，便受輿論界與社會的抨擊和厭棄，甚至認爲粵　電影是有受×人利用而麻醉觀衆嫌疑了。不知這兩點皆有相當錯誤的：在公司老板方面，不知道提高粵語電影的水準以吸引那些眞的觀衆，而拍些隨便的影片以將就些隨便的觀衆，這是誰也知道是一個重大的錯誤，而輿論界　，因爲粵語雷影水準低落、，便採取抨擊或厭棄的態度，絕口不談，這亦不是良好的對策。爲了擴大廣大羣衆宣傳；爲了糾正粵語片電影的沒落，我以爲輿論界對於粵語電影，該多下批評，好處便說他好。壞的不妨直白指斥他壞。務要將隨便的變為認眞，使粵語電影能得在這抗戰中盡其宣傳文化的重要什務！</p>
<p>我之拍「是夜光杯」。這眞是認爲一件幸過的事。當去年的時候，大家競爭着拍民間故事的影片。那時我尚是南洋公司的長期演員，我眞怕也捲入這游渦裏。僥倖南洋公司的老板待我好。知道我的個性。幷明瞭我不願那些沒意識的流行劇本的苦衷。於是　選定這著名的國防劇本『夜光杯』給我拍。在是一個良好的　試。我在這一部片，雖不敢云怎樣的收穫。但內心總覺情感能和劇中人一致，而沒有生硬之弊。拍完了。承導演高梨痕先生贈給我一本　競先生原著之『夜光杯』一書。幷寫上幾個字這「民國十十七年秋與　年女士合作　製比片。因女十之努力，得意外收穫，謹　此以誌感謝。』不錯，我拍這部片的時候，一方固然是爲着本身職業的責任而出力，而另一方面我總以爲我們影人報國之道，就是在於拍　有意識的影片，如果我能够把劇中人的內心一一描寫出來，使可以打動大衆的心弦，那麼對抗戰建國的宣傳就不無小繡了。在拍『夜光杯』一片中，我的心裏，常常這樣想着的。所以像高先生所說，努力我是有的而是應該的，但說什麼「收穫」則我不敢當了。</p>
<p>在「夜光杯」一片，由首至末，我皆認爲很滿意，故我曾寫過一篇小言說如能避免檢查剪割，則這部片總不會怎樣失敗的，然在公影後，我看　了。眞是有一點頭痛，許多緊要處，已通通不見了，這個原因何在，請觀衆想想吧！我知道有好些觀衆不明瞭其中內容必很　訝，以爲這部片的接駁何以如此差誤，乃不知其所以如此的，乃另有原因呀！</p>
<p>在過往有些話劇搬上影壇便失敗，這我們以爲不能歸咎於劇本方面的，我總認爲這一部極有濃厚國防意識的「夜光杯」，其不滿人意的地方，只在干被剪割太多而亂着吧。</p>
<p>國防影片，我以爲不是不能吸引觀衆的。祗要自己嚴格的檢討，而將拍　的工作認眞一點，將這止感意識擴大宣傳造成一種運動，使一般認眞的觀眾注意着。而認為　語片也能够什藝術水準上站一個位置。則風氣自當一易。生意經也來了。</p>

<p>申報兒童節特刊</p>
<h3>從兒童節說到兒童保育會</h3>
<p>— 王孝英</p>
<p>兒童兇是什麼？簡單地說，就是深護兒童的紀念日。兒童爲什麼要保護？因爲兒童是國家的幼年主人，民族解放的後備軍。哲學家拉柏圖不是說過　？「有了怎樣的人，就有怎樣的國。』其意　說：「要更好的國，必先有更好的公民。」我們知道現在的公民，是由過去的兒童生長而來，又知　將來的公民、是由現在的兒童婿養　成。那宋要想知道將來的公民怎機，專看現在培養的情形怎樣，也就看保育的情形怎樣，這是很明白的。</p>
<p>保育兒童的責任，在過去，十九　負在做母親的肩上，不過做母　所負的是家庭敎胄，一部份敎育、和社會化的兒童保育性質完全不同。和戰時的保育性質更不同，所　社會化的保育軍事化的保育，是集多數的兒童於一個場所內，不分彼此。施以嚴略的社會敎育和事事敎育，就是於知育之外，更施以精神的敎育，和體格的訓練。養成健全的公民，爲民族復興之張本。因爲所謂健全的公民，是就國家全體成年的人民明言。要爭民族最後勝利，和建立自由幸福的國家，必須全體公民一致地用血肉鬥爭而得來的。這種民族的鬥爭，絕非少數人所能到。也絕非普通敎　所能成功的。所以，我們現在所謂需要的社會化軍事化敎育，是要全體婦女共同負起這個責任。</p>
<p>我們對于這個國家民族的幼年主人，民族解放的後修軍，不僅僅是愛　便了　幷目應該啓發他們的民族意識、　以抗戰敎育，使他們有能力担負捍衛國家復興民族的任務。因此我們的愛護方法稱爲保育。</p>
<p>我自抗戰後，由戰區經過不少的困難，來到香港，認定我們的伯叔兄弟旣然都到前綫去抗戰，我們的姑嫂姊妹　使沒有力量去荷槍拖砲，也應該在後方負起選個保育兒童的重大責任來，幷且自從全民抗戰以來，×蹤所至，居宇爲壚，衛國將上的遺孤，陷在災區的幼童，×××××××××及死於厲疫和死於饑寒的，不知多少？而缺臂斷足流離失所的兒童，更是隨處都看得見，尤其可怕的，×人積極的使用一以華制華一的毒策，××××××××，××××，施以奴化敎育，使將來攻打我們大中華民族的×人，　是我們今日所認爲最親愛最司憐的一部份兒童，我一想到這裏，不禁淚如雨下，所以行裝甫卸，就趕快的加入這　保育兒童的工作。</p>
<p>本　，婦女和兒童是一條分不開的的索練，兒童離開婦女不能得到慈祥體貼的愛護，而婦女不能從家庭中解放出來　不能參加社會工作，所以要使國民半數的婦女，參加救亡工作，就必須使他們從家庭覊東中解放出來。現在我們所組　的戰時兒童保育會的宗旨，就是以少數婦女，担任保育兒童　工作，使大多數婦女，能够獨立自立的組織起來，現在抗戰將士的遺族。戰區的兒童，以及難民的兒童，其父母死於×人炮火之下。子女流浪於街頭巷尾，都是我們急於要做工作，都是戰時兒童你育會的責任。截至今日止。我們已做的工作固然也有些少成績，而未來要做的還多得很，况且戰區日益廣大。被難兒竄不下數十萬，以　有　育會來負起這重大的貴任。這是不可能的事實。所以，我們不僅希望將源有的徐育質的充實，我們還要把它量的擴允，我們不僅希望社會人士熱烈的贊助我們更希望本港婦女放下娛樂的工作來參加保護戰時兒童的工作，保護全國將來的主人翁。</p>
<p>最近在新大陸上有位神父，叫做　倫納根，他手創了一座兒中城（Boy　Town）專門敎育流浪兒童，不但供給他們的膳宿，而目敎育和陶冶他們的人格，他的目的在使社會上少一個遊民，多一個良民——好的公民，這个兒竄城誠可作我們的考鏡，今日爲兒童節。我自愧不文。無以貢獻，　以此自勉，幷以勉我諸姑姊妹！</p>
<h3>謹向僑胞請命！</h3>
<p>— 伍艷壯</p>
<p>—為四四兒童節紀念而作—</p>
<p>記得當去年中國戰時兒童會在漢。成立那一天，蔣夫人會經說過。「兒童保育，决不是一件平凡而普通的工作，實在是於國家民族很有關係的基本工作。兒童是未來的國民，是民族的幼苗，在平時已經該十分的愛　，何况在國民兵士大批犧牲的戰　。不好好培養兒童。怎樣塡補國家的損失？」</p>
<p>在今天，抗戰巳經開展到第二期國家生死存亡的最嚴重關頭，也是抗戰建國，民族復興的序幕的當中，我們懷着興奮熱烈的心情，抱着犧牲小我，共赴國　的不屈不撓的意志來紀念兒實節，我們不由不想念到前方忠勇浴血沙場的英勇將士，我們更不由不把我們的愛護國家，愛護兒意的精神，透澈地表演於我們的工作，事業中，來作紀念的獻禮。</p>
<p>自從一九二五年八月國際兒童促進會在日內瓦召集第一次大會，通過各項保護兒童的基本原則後，英美各國政府就决定把每年當中的一天作爲絕念兒童的節日。我國於民國二十年由中華慈幼會建議，國民政府明令頒布，定四月四日爲兒童節。以後每年全國都有一次熱烈的紀念。</p>
<p>我們知到，怎樣發揮兒童天賦的本能，怎樣改造兒童的環境，怎樣促進兒童的體格，是現代文明國家最重大最急切的事體，尤具是，我們今日在外患煎逼的惡劣環境中，我們更能體騐到，我們的兒童，不僅是我們生命的延續，亦是國家民族的生命的延續。總卹也說過：「我們的肖年，是我們的繼續的生命。」我們緊記着總理的遺言，更感到我們的責任的重大，我們應該　倍的努力于保育兒童工作，這才是紀念的眞義。</p>
<p>大家知到，在這杭戰廿閱月的艱難過程當中，我們的難童遭遇之慘；大家知到我們政府當局對於拯救戰區雞童約努力和苦心；大家也知到戰時兒實會，自成立以來，壹週年間所做過的保育兒童工作。但是我們想想這壹次戰爭，是正義，公卹和暴力，强權的總决門，也是我們　民埃的人力物力的總檢閱。我們要支持星期的抗戰，我們需要全力保育我們的兒童，我們要完成我們的新中國的建國大業，我們需要全力保育我們的兒童！</p>
<p>所謂「保育」默是「保」和「育」都要一齊做到，這兩者　相因的，也是相成的，旣不能一保」，自不能「育」，這是當然的因果，然而，只有「保」沒有「育」，也是徒　的。爲要完成我們的「保」和一育」的工作，我們不能不靠多量牧質的支持，這一點。是有賴於我全國海內外同胞熱烈的贊助。</p>
<p>我海外同胞，僑居遠邦，關懷祖國，過去對於革命工作的　　，已經有過光榮的歷史，這一次，戒們爲爭取全民族的自由而奮鬥，我們的僑胞們，不絕均熱烈的把他們辛苦者積儲，物力獻諸因家，這是值得全國人士敬佩的。在這一篇短文中，我木便把許多關於保育兒童的專鬥問題提出來研究。我祗願以一片誠摯的心情，爲我戰區千千萬萬的難童，向海外僑胞請命，並致虔誠之謝意。我們期待着更多的精神上的鼓勵，物質上的援助。這不僅是我們兒童之幸。是我們國家民族前途之幸！</p>
<p>救救這一羣吧　李波作</p>
<h3>紀念兒童節</h3>
<p>— 胡木蘭</p>
<p>我們應負的艱苦責任</p>
<p>今天是多麼可喜可慶的日子，我們中華民國的兒童節。兒童是國家生存的基礎，是選家將來的主人翁，兒竄節紀念之意義，實在　大非常。我國以四月四日爲兒童節，是二十一年才有的，由中華慈幼會的請求，經敎育部制定紀念辦法頒行。通令以後每年四月四日全國各小學幼稚園社會敎胄機關舉行紀念，於是兒童節便在中國產生了。</p>
<p>兒童節紀念的目的，是要鼓舞兒童與趣，啓發兒宣愛羣愛國愛家庭之心理，幷喚起社會注意兒童事業，語具工作，社會方面應站在極力贊助和抉持的地位，使兒童獲得最大的幸福，政府方胡應盡量擴充兒童的幸福事業，這可說是老生常談，大家部知道的，可是在暴×侵凌，國難嚴重的今日，紀念兒童節，我們當前的急務，莫過於救濟雖童。</p>
<p>我們抗戰戰，巳有一年另九個月，淪陷區將達版圖之半。因倫陷區城之廣闊，同胞流熊失所的日兒增加。可愛的兒童跟着他們父母逃難失敎養的或無人提携的，實在不可勝數。　我們在報上常常看到×軍×××××××××××××××的消息。我們兒童將變做×國的後備兵，我們兒童將變做×國生存之基礎×××××××××××××××××××。</p>
<p>所以今天我們紀念兒童節，最大最重的是應該設法救濟難童，第一，淪陷區域兒童，應即派人前往設法盡量救出，移往安全地帶，卹在迫近戰區的地方，凡出征軍人家屬；無人撫秀之兒童，亦應先行設法移送安全之境。第二，救出之雖童應　力設法妥爲安置，幷須因其年齡分別以適當之敎養，嬰孩應注意撫餐，在小學年齡的使其就學，年紀稍大的使其學習生產技能並受軍事訓練。這些例，僅略舉大概。切　進行，必有待於詳細規劃。不過我們可以肯定的說，這工作是爲兒童謀幸福也是爲社曾國　　福利，更可以說救濟戰區一個兒童，無異爲國家培養一個生力軍。中國救濟難童會去年在漢口成立，一切工作都在積極地推進中，今日紀念兒童節我們看到最急最要的救濟難宣工作已在進行，固然是一件最可慶辛的事情，但是　種非常重要的工作，决非政府方面　少數人去做可能濟事，必須社會各方血一致負責參加，才獲得宏偉的效果。我希望港中懸幼事業同胞，注意　戰區難意的慘苦。出錢出力共同負起救濟難實的責任。以　兒童的幸福。以發展國家的新生命。這是我在今年紀念兒童節爲最親愛最偉大的孩子所祝禱的。</p>
<h3>救救孩子</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>如果說世上頂可憐的是中國人的話，那麼中國的兒童就是最可憐中的頂可憐者。如果說中國全人口的一半都是兒童的話，那麼就可以有兩萬萬多扎的最可憐的絕　中的兒童。但是關心兒童生活的人，又有幾個？</p>
<p>曾經征服過三分之一世界的拿破侖，對於兒童也曾留下一句這樣的話：『兒童的命運握在母親的手掌中』。可惜的是根本中國的母親，在以前的世界中就沒會得到過人的待遇，握在奴隸掌中的小東西還能得稱爲有自由幸福的人麼？</p>
<p>西方的世界似乎比東方文明。所以西方的兒童地似乎較幸福一些。例如布塞東說一對於兒童的第一个義務就是使他們快樂」這一類的名言，是俯拾卽是的。不過最欠缺的却是西方的兒童也沒能受到合理的敎育，他們所承繼的也不過是成人們的享樂和麻醉生活。就如最近在美國靑年學生的對將來世界　動中的調察，百分六十以上的靑年人連打擊惡徒，維持公義的戰爭都反對了。靑年人的苟安的思想大致和兒童的心卹相去不遠麼。兒童對於享受高等的物質文明世界下的兒宣所抱有的希望，也不該太妄想了。</p>
<p>目前中國正在抗中戰，這次抗戰不但成人受了如此飽滿的　敎育，連呀呀學語的稚兒，也滿是浴過了這「從天上來」的洗禮，並相信一切不合理的侍遇與鎖，只有靠手脚，在行動中抗爭，今日中國民衆上向日本帝國主義者的奮起迎頭打擊，才能解放出來。</p>
<p>痛心的是自抗戰以來，我們及對兒童的保育，幷沒有做到我們應該做到的程度。　我們的文學家，藝術家，大學敎授，救護隊及宣傳家給了兒童甚麼東西？每次在戰場下爭得「相當代價下之後的　却，但是遺志了無數的生命並兒童。文學家和藝術家並至大學敎授所給予兒童的恐怕只是生疏怯懼罷！</p>
<p>每當一鄕一鎭的退雄時候，戰船上，車上，擠死的多是弱　兒童。被遺棄的也是兒童。我們的慈警家和宗敎家呢？</p>
<p>至於在安靜的後方兒童呢？假使父親是官階級的話，那麼兒童也就隨了父親享樂荒淫；假使父親是被驅使不目由的牛馬，那麼他的兒子就是被遺棄的廢物。總之都是虐殺。</p>
<p>我不相信，這一代的兒童如果都死絕了，還會有豐勃盛此的下一代，更不必提甚麼抗戰建國！</p>
<p>魯迅在狂人日記中的一句話『救救孩子罷』，依舊是今日有力的呼語。在爭取民族獨立自由的偉大抗戰中。我們再喊出這个慘痛待援的呼語：</p>
<p>救救孩子罷！</p>
<h3>小鄰人</h3>
<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>差不多每天都要這樣，那比什麼還要富於魅力的聲音，使我不能不茫然的睜　了兩眼，唔！是多麼準確的啊！一到晨間，就像報晚的雀子似的，唱出那又稺氣又動人的歌來了。</p>
<p>『我！的！家……』</p>
<p>這樣，我就帶着泛泛的感覺，一天的生活開始了。</p>
<p>在最初的時候，我爲這個新來的小鄰人所攪　。於是，走出　樓去探問。</p>
<p>『喂！小朋友，你的家，在那里呀？』</p>
<p>他把歌唱停下來，眼晴骨碌骨碌的轉動着。</p>
<p>『在松花江上』，說着就吃吃地笑了。</p>
<p>『眞的？你知道松花江在那裏嗎』？我一面擦着牙一面就在彼此隔着的知牆邊談起來。</p>
<p>『不』。他憂傷了。這憂傷好像是那隻歌傳染給他的。</p>
<p>那麼，你是廣州來的？』</p>
<p>『也不是。我們從西樵來的。』</p>
<p>慢慢地，我們熟識起來。原來他跟他的媽媽在去年十一月逃出來的，父親却在廣州失陷前向　西的德安開拔去了。直到今天，還不知道　的消息。也許他正在有的名廬山游擊隊軍戰鬥着。而他母子兩人，在一條叫做染布街的房子裏件下來。天天過　懷鄉病的生活，到了今年正月，就不能支持下去。於是，搬到了他姑媽的家裏來搭住。那就是我的不常見面的鄰——一個在風燈廠裏做工的同時又是包租的中年婦人。</p>
<p>日子慢慢的過着，他的歌唱也仍然在晨問繼續。隣居的另一個孩子敎了他有一天早上，兩個人奇怪的唱着又笑着，我仔細聽聽，才知道他們把『進行曲』裏的「中華　埃』四字，故意改爲『葱菜牛肉』。而且唱得特別　興而大聲。直到一個什麼樣的女人走出來，大馬他們　得不正經時，才停止。</p>
<p>他雖然是個十一歲的孩子，但却知道得很多。晚飯後，常常和我談起他的西樵。他說是不怕日本飛機的炸彈的，但却很怕那射下來的機關槍，有一次，他被大雨似的在地面上飛着彈子的槍彈，嚇倒了。說到這裏，他就大人似的不服氣的伸警拳頭：『我們輸給日本的，就只有飛機，如果有日本的機多的飛機，還不老早把他打退嗎？』而一面又想起西樵來，他的面孔閃着光，因爲聽見人說，那喪現在有了許多游擊隊，就連向來搶人的土匪，也打起日本來了，但他卹又爲自己種的那株木瓜樹，以及他所愛爲的一些東西和同伴，而暗淡下來。</p>
<p>我常常給一些書報他看，有天，我指着那里的兒童團說。。</p>
<p>『你看，他們也打日本的，』</p>
<p>他輕蔑似的說，</p>
<p>『這個，我也會。』</p>
<p>記得有一天，我的幾位要回內地服務的朋友，帶了許多小學生來到我家裏，說是要到郊外去拍張相，我便邀了小鄰人一齊去。在郊外幾個朋友對孩子們談起內地的兒童團來，什麼山西和陜西的孩子，都會放槍呀！活躍東江一帶的兒童團，怎樣怎樣在日本飛機下向老百姓宣傳呀！這故事，使那些孩子們大大地激　着，執拗地說要跟先生們囘鄕服務去，特別是兩個十四歲的女孩子，要求先生許　參加服務團，把老林弄得不好收拾。回來時，我那個小隣舍，一路沉默着，到了樓梯，他突然十分莊重的說：　（未完）</p>

<h3>A Major Battle is Imminent on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway; Tension Increases in Eastern Zhejiang with Added Warships; Our Forces Firmly Defend Northwest of Jinxian</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 2nd] The focus of the war remains in South China. The enemy's attack south of the Gan River is still pressing. Two enemy regiments are attacking Gaoan, engaging in fierce fighting with our forces along the Shilitui, Qilishani, and Taojiazhuang line near the north of the city. Those advancing towards Jinxian are being blocked by our forces in the mountainous area northwest of the county. More of our reinforcements are continuing to arrive and will inflict heavy damage on the enemy along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 2nd] More than two hundred enemy troops entrenched in Nanchang, after passing Xiebu Lane (12 kilometers southeast of Nanchang), arrived at Luo Huidu (10 kilometers northwest of Jinxian) at 10 PM on the 1st. We are intercepting them. There are no changes in the fighting west of Liangjiadu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Linchuan, 2nd] At 9 PM on the 1st, about two enemy infantry regiments and one artillery column launched a fierce attack on our troops in the northeast of Gaoan. Fierce fighting continued until the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 3rd] According to reports, enemy warships in eastern Zhejiang have increased, with a tendency to coordinate attacks with those in the Gan River area. We have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 3rd] In the Jiangsu-Anhui area, the fighting has been intense for days. One of our armies has broken through the enemy's lines and reached its destination.</p>
<h3>Our Forces Recapture the North Street of Jiangmen; The Battle Northeast of Xinhui Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Macau, 3rd] Jiangmen has now been recaptured by the Chinese army. Two divisions of the Guangxi Army arrived in Jiangmen yesterday and immediately launched a fierce counter-offensive, surrounding the Japanese army and cutting off their retreat. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with only a few retreating across the river to Jiujiang. The Japanese army completely withdrew from Jiangmen during the action. By 4 PM, the Japanese army...</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 3rd] Yesterday, the enemy invading Jiangmen again attacked Lile Village in Xinhui, using nine tanks to cover the advance of over five hundred infantrymen. We had previously destroyed the highway and our troops intercepted them in the narrow mountain roads. Our detachments circled around to the enemy's rear, unleashing a barrage of gunfire. The enemy was surrounded on all sides and their formation was in chaos. We seized the opportunity to charge and kill dozens of the enemy. There are no enemy traces in Lile Town at the moment. Yesterday morning, Jiangmen was officially recaptured by us, and two to three hundred enemy soldiers were captured. Regarding the battle in the vicinity of Huicheng, with the cooperation of a certain Guilin regiment of Deng Longguang and a part of the Guangxi Army, along with the Fifth War Zone guerrilla teams and the people's determined resistance, progress is smooth, forming a stalemate.</p>
<p>[Shiqi Quick Report, 3rd] The defense of Zhongshan is fortified, and local peace is as usual. The reporter met with County Magistrate Zhang on the morning of the 3rd. According to him, the county government received reports from the front line that on the afternoon of the 2nd, a certain two regiments of the Guangxi Army launched a counter-offensive from the Dahui Village, northeast of Huicheng, towards the enemy in the Baisha area, wiping out over a hundred enemy soldiers. At that time, there were several enemy planes assisting, but our army fought extremely bravely and made efforts to counter-attack. The enemy eventually could not withstand and retreated towards Jiangmen. Our army took advantage of the situation to advance towards Jiangmen. In addition, the Fourth War Zone Headquarters and the provincial government sent the capable... two officers to Zhongshan to inspect the teams. They arrived in Shiqi this morning and inspected them at Renshan Square. In the afternoon, County Magistrate Zhang, together with the special commissioner, went to the Xiaolan front line in the Third District to inspect. The report stated that the Zhongshan County Government had stopped collecting an additional five yuan per vehicle for the Qiguan vehicle. The county government confirmed that this was absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 2nd] The enemy invading Shaping was intercepted by our army, and a fierce battle unfolded. Our forces fought bravely, killing over two hundred enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered a major setback. The remaining enemy planned to escape to Zhuangyuan Mountain and other places, relying on the dangerous terrain to resist. We are currently encircling and annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 2nd] On the evening of the 28th, our teams launched a counter-offensive against Shaping, which belongs to Heshan County, heavily surrounding the enemy. The enemy, numbering about four hundred, had five tanks and two steel cannons. Near Shaping, our army suddenly surrounded and attacked them, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. After losing Shaping, the remaining enemy lost their combat effectiveness, stubbornly resisted relying on the dangerous terrain, and used four planes to indiscriminately drop bombs. As of the morning of the 29th, the struggle for Shaping was still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] The enemy invading Shaping after crossing the Jiujiang River continued to add four to five hundred infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen, and four tanks. More than a thousand reinforcements are crossing the river. In the past four days, the enemy has transported seven hundred wounded soldiers to Jiujiang, which shows the intensity of the fighting there. The enemy landing in Jiangmen numbered about a thousand, with six tanks.</p>
<h3>Report from the Hong Kong Xinhui Chamber of Commerce on the War Situation and Disaster Situation in Jiangmen</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The Hong Kong Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, in order to understand the war situation and disaster situation in Jiangmen so as to facilitate relief, publicly appointed Zhang Lanzhou, the vice-chairman of the Chamber, to go to Macau with Lu Aiyun, the chairman of the Jiangmen City Chamber of Commerce, to investigate. According to Mr. Zhang's return to Hong Kong, the situation before the 30th of last month is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the morning of the 29th, the enemy has launched an invasion of Jiangmen by the sea and air forces from several routes, including Tianhe, Zhutou Mountain, and Wai Xue. We responded on all routes. On the same day, Chen Chi, the captain of the Self-Defense Brigade, launched a counter-offensive in Tangxia and fought a deadly battle with the enemy. The enemy was driven out of Tianhe. On the 30th, the enemy reinforced with more than three thousand troops, and planes bombed the area relentlessly. The shallow-water fleet in the north street kept firing artillery, and also used speedboats and cavalry, etc., to charge in by different routes. Because we were outnumbered and our weapons were inferior, we shortened our defense line and retreated into the urban area. Then the enemy charged in from all directions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand street fighting, gaining and losing ground several times, resulting in a stalemate that lasted all day. After wiping out over a hundred enemy soldiers, we began to withdraw to the suburbs and dispersed. The part that retreated to Huicheng ambushed between Dahui and Qibang. At that time, the enemy charged towards Huicheng along the Ningyang Railway, and we intercepted them in Dahui, Qibang, and other places, causing many casualties on both sides. On April 1st, the enemy began to approach the outskirts of Huicheng. We defended Guifeng, Xishan, Xiangshan and other places outside the city and fought fiercely with the enemy.</p>
<p>All the personnel involved in this resistance war were determined to sacrifice themselves and deal with the enemy. Commander Li and County Magistrate Wu Zi remained calm and stayed in the county government from the 29th to April 1st, calmly directing operations day and night with a telephone in hand. It was reported that his hand was injured by shrapnel. Deputy Commander Zhou Hanling, when he arrived in Tangxia, was machine-gunned by enemy planes while traveling by car from Tingdou to Shuanglong, injuring his right hand. He immediately bandaged it with cloth and went to Daxian. Squad leader Zhou Fu was the most commendable. He defended the East Fortress and the Shuinan line, and remained steadfast for two days and nights, finally sacrificing himself heroically.</p>
<p>In this battle, in addition to the sea and air forces, the enemy increased its infantry to more than five thousand people. On our side, there were the Xinhui Special Fourth Company, the self-defense regiments of Chen Chi, Shi Songping, and Yin Hongfei, one battalion each, and the national military reserve company, the county government political police team, and about one battalion of police, fighting the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. Female transport teams also participated in the battle, and the villagers, hearing that the enemy was coming, even took up farm tools to fight the enemy desperately. Their loyalty and courage were enough to chill the enemy's hearts. General Deng Longguang's large reinforcements, in order to avoid air strikes, traveled at night and were said to have arrived... Now they are deployed on various lines outside Huicheng, and a joint counter-offensive is imminent, which will surely produce amazing results.</p>
<p>It was also found that the enemy occupied Jiangmen and used the Pengjiang Hotel as its headquarters. They searched door-to-door in the villages of Fanluo, Zini, Yunjing, and Dongcangli in an attempt to find our troops, killing many people. The enemy garrisoned in Waihai extorted three million yuan in currency.</p>
<p>The shops and population of Jiangmen have been evacuated and are now a dead city. Most of the disaster-stricken villagers came to Macau by sea. County Magistrate Li was very concerned and, despite his hand injury, telegraphed the heads of coastal villages to send self-defense regiments and reserve teams to protect the refugees in different routes, so that they could escape in an orderly manner. It was reported that Feng Jie, the captain of the Muzhou team, continuously used boats to transport and protect the refugees, which was very effective. Most of the wounded soldiers and civilians in Jiangmen were transported to the vicinity of Huicheng, where Zhang Jiuliang, the chairman of the Red Cross branch, led the rescue teams to provide assistance to various hospitals day and night.</p>
<p>In this battle, when our county fought with the enemy, the enemy initially overstepped their bounds. Our teams numbered only over two thousand, and the enemy then used more than five thousand troops, as well as airplanes, warships, tanks, and cavalry to confront us. However, we were able to support with all our strength, turning the situation around with fewer troops. Although this was due to Li Wuzi's gaining the support of the people, and Zhou Hongzhi's bravery in battle, the local gentry also led the people and united sincerely, so that everyone was of one mind and displayed the spirit of resisting the enemy and defending the land, adding another glorious page to the history of the Chinese Republic's resistance against the enemy.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang then said that he had discussed relief issues with Mr. Qu Zesen, Chairman of the Chamber, Manager... and other colleagues this morning. Everyone suggested that a meeting of the Chamber's Relief Association be convened immediately to discuss relief measures and to send telegrams to commend those who had contributed to the battle.</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Hunan-Jiangxi War Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Aviation News from Changsha] Since March 18, the enemy forces in northern Jiangxi began their attack with the aim of capturing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Ruoxi in the middle reaches of the Xiu River to Wucheng in Hekou, a fierce battle unfolded along the entire line. As of the end of March, the main enemy forces who crossed the Xiu River forcefully at Goutouling between Qiujin and Yongxiu had captured Nanchang. Other enemy forces, under the cover of tanks, were confronting us in the area of Liantang, Shabutan, and Sanjiangkou. Nanchang is an important town in northern Jiangxi and the gateway to eastern Hunan. It also occupies an important position in the transportation links to the southeast and southwest. Therefore, we believe that we will launch a counter-offensive in the near future.</p>
<p>On the enemy's side, capturing Nanchang is actually an unnecessary waste. This is why they only started attacking Nanchang after occupying Jiujiang and Wuchang. More than a year of large-scale warfare has taught them: as long as China's field army exists for one day, China will definitely have a day to destroy them; but China's field army is being strengthened and expanded, and their dream of annihilating it will never come true. Therefore, they thought: if China's international transportation lines are not cut off, China will definitely have righteous friends who will provide more substantial assistance in terms of materials. Judging from the enemy's occupation of Hainan Island, the intensification of the construction of fortifications, the construction of airfields and warehouses, and the active increase in reinforcements in Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, and the clearing of the rear, they are indeed preparing to cut off our international transportation lines in the southwest and northwest. If the enemy puts all its strength on this strategy, it is not something to be ignored.</p>
<p>But the enemy is an adventurous merchant with a shortage of capital, and also a rogue gambler who scrapes everywhere at home to make a desperate gamble. He does not have so much capital to take that big risk: he walks into the casino with a small amount of money he has pieced together and does not know which door to bet on to win. The world recognizes that there are no adventurous merchants or rogue gamblers who become rich.</p>
<p>International events, domestic realities, and the hundreds of soldiers who are fighting endless wars in China make the Japanese warlords more impatient and anxious than an adventurous merchant or a gambler. Especially for the people at home and the soldiers on the expedition, five months after occupying the two empty cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou, they must find something quite stimulating to comfort the people and boost their morale. Therefore, after once being active in central Hubei, they chose Nanchang again. In fact, if he concentrated all his strength from central Hubei and broke through to the west, he might have stepped on the land of Jingzhou or Yichang. Regardless of whether there would be no more advance from then on, but only the opportunity to retreat, he could also shamelessly make sensational propaganda to the country, such as "the Imperial Army is only so many kilometers away from China's capital, Chongqing."</p>
<p>So what about Nanchang?</p>
<p>Nanchang, Changsha, and Wuchang, these three points can almost form an equilateral triangle. The enemy has occupied Wuchang and Nanchang. After losing two corners, it is naturally quite difficult for us to defend Changsha this corner. In the parallelogram formed by Jiujiang, Yueyang, Changsha, and Nanchang, stands the natural fortress bestowed upon us by the Creator - Mount Mufu. On the one hand, it breaks through the special corner situation between Wuchang, the Yangtze River, and Yueyang, hindering the communication between the Yangtze River and Yueyang, and at the same time threatening the middle of southern Hubei from the mountainous areas on both sides of the Xiu River in a commanding posture. This great, deep mountain range between the border areas of Hunan and Hubei can accommodate one or two hundred thousand troops without being seen. It can actively attack the strongholds surrounding it on the north, east, and south sides, and retreat to preserve its strength, and cover the three Xiang regions. Therefore, although the enemy occupies Nanchang and cuts off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they only deepen the mistake of invading the inland and fall into the quagmire of being attacked on all sides, destroying the Japanese goods market that could still be smuggled from Guangzhou and Haikou to the inland... What is facing them is a broader "sea and land" and a deeper mountainous area. They do not have more manpower, material resources, and financial resources to control a larger battlefield, protect longer battle lines, and defend more strongholds.</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view, it is also a mistake for the enemy to expand the Hunan-Jiangxi battlefield. The enemy's operations have far exceeded their original plan. The equipment of the enemy's army is for plain warfare. The ideal war zone is outside the Great Wall, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. They have also prepared for coastal operations, so there are a considerable number of special landing units. In reality, they did not expect to fight a mountain war with China. Although they also have two or three (at most four) divisions equipped for mountain warfare, they were exhausted in the mountain wars in southern Jiangxi and the mountains of Anhui and Hubei during the Wuhan Battle. From the most recent spoils of war, the maps of Jiangxi and Hunan they are using - especially Hunan - are far less detailed than the maps they used in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Shandong. They are currently committing the mistake of being "led by others" that Sun Tzu called "those who are good at using troops lead others, but are not led by others."</p>
<p>The enemy's adventurous actions between Mount Mufu and Poyang Lake are giving us a good opportunity for a large-scale encirclement and annihilation. For the upcoming major counter-offensive, we will definitely retake Nanchang. International people will say: Although the Japanese have occupied seven major cities in China, they cannot occupy China's eighth city; just like that unanimous determination to resist Japan. (The general idea is like this) Now, let us use this determination to recapture our eighth city and defend the gateway to eastern Hunan! (Zhang Dangren. Three, Thirty-one)</p>
<h3>Commemorating Children's Day with Action; Childcare Centers Established Throughout the Counties of Guangxi; Relief Association Rescuing Refugee Children from Hubei</h3>

They plan to set up a branch office in Xiangyang to expand the work.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Commemorating Children's Day</h3>
<p>Children are the future masters of the nation and the determiners of the world's future destiny. All countries in the world regard children's affairs as one of the major national undertakings, and the annual commemorations of Children's Day are even more enthusiastic. In the past, our country was plagued by internal strife and foreign aggression, and children's affairs were not given due attention. In view of this, the China Child Welfare Association submitted a request to the National Government on March 7th of the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], clearly designating April 4th, a time of vigorous spring, as Children's Day. Since then, national commemorations have been held for eight years. However, in the past, most were routine commemorations, and there seemed to be few concrete plans for activities that truly benefited children, and even fewer praiseworthy actions. Only after the full-scale War of Resistance began, last year's Children's Day, under the advocacy of the women's leader, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, saw a nationwide call to strive for wartime children's affairs. For example, regarding child care work, there is already an organization of childcare associations, and initial progress is still smooth. As for the relief and education of child refugees, the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, has repeatedly ordered local governments to pay attention. However, in the past year, with the expansion of the war zones, looking back at the work of child care, it is still far behind the needs. Therefore, when commemorating this year's Children's Day, we cannot but think of the children in the war zones under the gunfire and swords of the Japanese, suffering from hunger, cold, displacement, and death! We cannot but think of the children in the occupied areas, suffering from bullying, ×××××××××. We cannot but think of the children in all parts of our vast motherland, they are in distress! They are wandering! They have lost their homes! They cannot see their parents. Under such a new situation, our urgent task in commemorating Children's Day is, first, to intensify the work of rescuing our children in the war zones and occupied areas. Second, it is to expand the promotion of nurturing the descendants of our nation, and nurturing the masters of the new China. We must, without any delay, transport the children in and near the war zones to safe areas, to the more distant rear, to avoid the devastation and bombing of the Japanese. We must also use a variety of methods to launch the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor struggle in the occupied areas, and do everything possible to relieve, organize, and educate the children in the occupied areas. We must systematically investigate and register the children rescued from the war zones and the children originally in the rear; organize them into groups, divide and send them out, guarantee their material life, implement correct and appropriate spiritual education, and use all their possibilities to increase the strength of the War of Resistance (such as the Boy Scouts in Shanghai assisting the army and the children's theater troupes traveling throughout the country to engage in propaganda during the War of Resistance). In order to cultivate the basic talents for the future construction of a new China of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>In order to perfectly achieve our current urgent requirements, we must immediately strive for the following tasks that must be implemented at present:</p>
<p>On the government side, it should further recognize the great significance of rescuing child refugees and caring for children at present, and use laws and other appropriate methods to help wartime childcare associations and other enthusiasts in caring for children, increase assistance in transporting children from the war zones, allocate needed housing to provide food and clothing needs, widely solicit pediatricians and nurses for medicines, and implement refugee education suitable for the War of Resistance, etc. The government has already done its best in the past, and should universally intensify its efforts in the future.</p>
<p>On the people's side, we should recognize that rescuing child refugees and caring for children at present has the great significance of reducing national sacrifices, reducing our own sacrifices, and guaranteeing the future life of our nation. It is the current bounden duty of all Chinese sons and daughters. Therefore, all sectors of our men and women, especially organized mass organizations, must immediately strive to help the government and practically start from their own scope, concentrate financial and human resources, and expand the childcare movement. In particular, overseas Chinese should expand the fundraising movement and the medical donation movement for this purpose.</p>
<p>On the international front, we must expand propaganda work, on the one hand, use concrete materials to expose the truth of the Japanese harming our children and women, increase international indignation against the Japanese, and on the other hand, explain the importance of caring for Chinese children in ensuring China's victory in the War of Resistance, success in national construction, and even safeguarding world peace, in order to gain the sympathy and assistance of international people. The Soviet Union and various countries in Europe and America have successively provided material assistance to Spanish refugees, and the workers and masses of the Soviet Union and other countries, together with peace-loving and righteous people all over the world, have separately cared for thousands of Spanish refugees, which are good examples.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also strive to cultivate specialized talents in childcare. We hope that wealthy compatriots will assist the government in establishing childcare cadre training schools to provide a large number of such specialized talents. Others with medical and nursing knowledge and experience should enthusiastically volunteer in the spirit of national spiritual mobilization.</p>
<p>If we want to strive for national liberation, we must rescue and care for the descendants of our nation. We persevere in the War of Resistance for the construction of a new China, and we must even more resolutely strive to rescue and care for the future masters of the new China. And only by expanding relief and childcare can we reassure our soldiers to fight, workers to work, farmers to farm, and women can also be spared the burden of their children and participate in the work of the War of Resistance and national construction. All Chinese men and women compatriots who do not want to be slaves, we must cooperate and earnestly shoulder the task of childcare given to us by history. The masters of the new China will grow and thrive in the bloody battles of gunfire!</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Scope: Soviet Union Aims to Extend to the Far East, Urges Closer Cooperation Between Britain and the Soviet Union; President Roosevelt Pays Attention to the European Situation</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Yesterday, the Soviet press criticized Britain's guarantees to Poland, believing that Britain's guarantees were not thorough and demanding closer ties between Britain and the Soviet Union. The government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," called Chamberlain's declaration "ineffective" and repeatedly cited the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting. The Soviet Union favored a comprehensive anti-aggression declaration, in which not only related countries but also small and medium-sized countries and the Soviet Union would participate, rather than a unilateral declaration by Britain. The newspaper further demanded that Britain and France abandon their non-intervention policy and resume collective security actions. If they agree to oppose any aggression, the Soviet Union will certainly provide full assistance. According to diplomatic circles, the last sentence above indicates that Moscow intends to expand the anti-aggression declaration and apply it to the Far East.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] The Soviet Union's opinion on Britain's guarantee to Poland is that Britain may exert pressure on Poland to force it to cede the Polish Corridor, which is viewed with suspicion. "Pravda" published an official commentary stating that "the results of the Munich Conference are a reason why the Soviet press cannot trust British foreign policy. From then on, the floodgates to prevent fascist aggression were opened, and peace-loving democratic countries, especially those at the forefront, were hit by the torrent. The only way to eliminate this mistrust is to take action to show a determination to actively resist aggression."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] President Roosevelt, who is currently on vacation, is paying close attention to the European situation. Yesterday, the President had a telephone conversation with State Department officials on a dedicated line. At the same time, communications from the US embassies in Britain and France can also be connected to the line for direct conversations with the President.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, Britain and Italy are the behind-the-scenes countries "appeasing" the situation in Central Europe. It is reported that Britain is making every effort to reach an understanding between France and Italy, while Italy is mediating the tense relations between Poland and Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck will arrive in Britain tomorrow. After Hitler's speech in Wilhelmshaven, the British House of Commons will also discuss foreign policy tomorrow, and the center of political interest will return to London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said: "Beck's visit to Britain, accompanied by many officials and experts to attend the meeting, indicates that the situation of British and French guarantees to Poland will continue to develop." The question of further guaranteeing the security of peace-loving countries will also be one of the issues to be discussed in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, Labor opposition leader Attlee, currently represented by Greenwood due to illness, is expected to deliver a public speech at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow, proposing that the authorities take more active steps to expand the scope of Chamberlain's declaration last Friday. At that time, Chamberlain will discuss this issue after Greenwood makes a general statement. Liberal leader Sinclair, Eden, Churchill, or Lloyd George will also participate in the debate, and finally Dalton and Simon will represent the Labor Party and the government to conclude the debate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Labor opposition leader Greenwood will be the first to speak when the House of Commons meets tomorrow to debate foreign affairs. He criticized Hitler's speech yesterday in Bradford, saying that what he declared was no different from his established strategy. Hitler did not put forward any constructive proposals to resolve the European situation, and his strategy is still to intimidate small and weak countries in Europe, creating a situation of unease in Europe. As long as this strategy continues, the crisis of war, even though Hitler says he wants to avoid it, will continue to exist.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The British branch of the World Peace Congress held a meeting today, with hundreds of representatives from all walks of life participating. It was decided to hold a large-scale demonstration in Hyde Park on the 16th to support the collective security policy and advocate that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, and other countries willing to participate should conclude a peace alliance.</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Minister Beck Arrives in London Yesterday; Germany Threatens Poland Again, Saying It Will Cancel the Friendship Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Euston, 3rd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck, who is currently visiting London, arrived here this morning and crossed the Channel to Douvres at 11 am. When Colonel Beck passed through Berlin last night, the car stopped for 20 minutes. He did not get out of the car. An official from the German Foreign Ministry visited Beck and stayed for five minutes. Beck's talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Cox were very free. Tonight, he will attend a banquet at the Foreign Ministry, and tomorrow noon he will have lunch with the British. In the evening, he will attend a banquet at the Polish Embassy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, 3rd] Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, along with several attendants, departed for London yesterday to discuss with British Prime Minister Chamberlain the proposal for British aid when Poland encounters German aggression. According to official views, Hitler's speech on Saturday can show the seriousness of the British hard-line policy in Hitler's mind, but the general view is that Germany has no immediate intention of attacking Poland. According to sources in Berlin, the Polish Foreign Minister arrived at the Silesian border at 8:45 pm and left at 9:11 pm. He did not get out of the car. The German side only sent representatives to give a routine welcome, and only talked for about five minutes. Many reporters gathered at the station, but the Polish Foreign Minister did not make any comments.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd] The German Foreign Ministry is now waiting for the outcome of the Polish Foreign Minister's talks with the British government in London, and is well aware that the talks will mention Germany's future actions in Central Europe. Hitler issued a warning to Poland and Britain in his speech in Wilhelmshaven yesterday, saying that Germany will never allow hostile countries to implement an encirclement policy against Germany. Observers with knowledge of the situation say that Hitler's words are the last warning to Polish Foreign Minister Beck. If Poland abandons its neutral policy and destroys its friendship with Germany, it should bear the responsibility for it. German party members expressed indignation at Britain's guarantee to Poland, saying that Germany did not intend to mobilize its troops and attack Poland, and condemned Britain's anti-German sentiment. German political circles declared that if Poland allies with Britain and France to oppose Germany, Germany will eliminate its obligations to Poland under the 1934 German-Polish Friendship Agreement. The term of the agreement is still five years. General observers believe that this agreement can guarantee that Germany will not immediately invade the "Polish Corridor" or change the status of Danzig.</p>
<h3>Government Guarantees Romania's Integrity; Suspected of Assisting in Strengthening the Air Force; Romanian Foreign Minister Will Visit Turkey</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Viking, 3rd] It is reported that British Minister to Romania Sir Ho has verbally stipulated with the Romanian government that Britain guarantees the territorial integrity of Romania, just as it does with Poland. Romanian Minister to London Tisi returned here last week. This trip was the most strenuous, and he went to London before Sunday, hoping to arrive at the same time as Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in order to participate in discussions to maintain the status quo in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to "Daily Mail", King Carol and the Romanian cabinet have decided to accept the British assistance and the Polish guarantee to resist German aggression. As for the British side, if it can receive a reply from Romania today, the Prime Minister will announce it in the House of Commons' foreign affairs discussion. The newspaper said that the British side also requested Romania to provide a guarantee that if Poland is attacked, it will immediately provide assistance to Poland.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 3rd] It is felt here that Britain and France's guarantee to Poland is a step to defend other Eastern European countries. According to authoritative sources, after Britain provides a guarantee of resistance to aggression to Romania, it will loan money to the country to help strengthen the Romanian air force. It is reported that Romania currently has no more than 300 first-line aircraft, and there are also very few aviators who are accustomed to flying at night. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will visit Turkey this week, at which time he will discuss the issue of foreign warships passing through the straits during wartime and reaching Romania. The general public deeply hopes to achieve a favorable outcome.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Romanian Capital, 2nd] It is reported that the British government has agreed with the authorities here on the matter of guaranteeing Romania's integrity. It is generally believed that the British government will issue a statement to the House of Commons tomorrow, stating its guarantee to Romania. It is also reported that the Romanian Foreign Minister plans to go to Ankara before visiting the capitals of Western European countries to spend the holiday there, in order to discuss the Dardanelles Strait issue. It is generally believed that Romania is now eager to obtain Turkey's promise that when Romania is attacked, the warships of Romania's aid providers can come to aid through the strait. In this regard, Romania has hopes not only for the French navy, but also for the British navy, because Britain has just agreed to guarantee its territorial integrity.</p>
<h3>Former Polish Prime Minister Shot and Seriously Wounded; Rumors That He Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] General Rawicz, former Prime Minister of Poland, was found shot today and was taken to the hospital. His injuries are very serious. It is said that he attempted suicide.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Dispute Temporarily Resolved; Both Parties Have Signed an Agreement with a Term of One Year</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Moscow, 2nd) The Soviet Union and Japan signed a fisheries agreement today with a term of one year. (Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the Soviet-Japanese fisheries issue has been resolved and a public statement will be issued soon. Today is a Japanese holiday, and no detailed announcement has been made here. (Reuters, Moscow, 3rd) In the new Soviet-Japanese fisheries agreement, the Soviet Union has agreed to allow ten of the thirty-seven locations previously reserved due to topographical reasons to be exchanged in the same way. The number of locations leased by the Japanese side is twenty-five fewer than in the old agreement, and all are paying a 10% higher rent.</p>
<h3>Philippine Islands Security Threatened by Japan; US Senator Speaks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US Senator King said today that Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands threatens the security and sovereignty of the Philippine Islands. This move by Japan is another example of Japan's attempt to dominate East Asia. Germany, Italy, and Japan have an agreement to advance simultaneously in different directions, and this has now been proven. While Germany and Italy are threatening Britain and France in Europe, Japan is continuing its aggression in the Far East. Since 1933, almost every incident has occurred simultaneously, making it impossible for other countries to cope. As for Japan's approach, it is regrettable because Japan endangers the rights of the United States in the Far East. However, this is a French problem and the United States cannot protest or take action against Japan. Japan took advantage of Germany and Italy's demands to occupy the islands, while the US Congress rejected the Guam harbor construction bill, indicating that the United States is unwilling to provoke Japan's position in the Far East, so Japan dares to act recklessly.</p>
<h3>How to Resolve the Issue of Volunteer Soldiers in Spain Raises Questions in the French Press; Large Number of People Arrested in Madrid</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 3rd] After General Franco issued the official announcement on Saturday that the Spanish Civil War has officially ended, the French weekly newspapers raised questions about how to resolve the issue of Italian volunteer soldiers. One newspaper believes that if Mussolini still refuses to send the Italian army back at this time, and violates the promise he made to Chamberlain during his last visit to Italy, then the Anglo-Italian Agreement signed in October 1938 will be just a formality, because the agreement stipulates the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers. However, according to the newspaper's speculation, Mussolini must be unwilling to withdraw the Italian army, because doing so would be tantamount to destroying the tool he uses to realize his Mediterranean ambitions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] A report arriving here from Madrid stated that General Franco's military police have arrested 2,000 people in the past 24 hours. Electricity costs are not published in part.</p>
<h3>Germany's Budget for 1939; Military Spending Not Published</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Today, the "Legal Gazette" published Germany's budget for 1939, the total amount of guarantees reached 123,000,000 pounds, including 40,000,000 pounds specifically for promoting export trade. It is reported that the government has no intention of publishing detailed budget figures at present, and the Finance Minister is also authorized to use 16,000,000 pounds within the four-year plan for industrial development. It is difficult to predict what Germany will use to expand its rearmament in the future.</p>
<h3>French President Disregards Opposition from Various Parties, Agrees to Participate in Elections Again</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] President Lebrun quoted the name of former President Doumergue today, saying, "I did not come for my own personal interests, I cannot ignore the interests of the people." It is generally believed that this statement can be regarded as Lebrun's agreement to participate in the general election again. 156 Socialist members of the Chamber of Deputies, 14 Socialist senators, 29 Social Republican members of the Chamber of Deputies, and a large number of Radical Socialist members of the Chamber of Deputies have all opposed Lebrun's participation in the general election again. Lebrun's expression today shows that he has disregarded this opposition and agreed to participate in the general election.</p>
<h3>Belgian Parliamentary Elections</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 3rd] Belgium elected members of parliament yesterday. It is reported that officials will not formally announce the results until this afternoon or tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Belgian Capital, 5th] The final results of the Belgian parliamentary elections are announced as follows: Catholic Party 73 seats (10 more than before), Social Democratic Party 60 seats (6 fewer than before), Liberal Party 33 seats (10 more than before), Flemish Nationalist Party 17 seats (1 fewer than before), Communist Party 9 seats (no change), Royalist Party 4 seats (16 fewer than before), Independent 1 seat, Army Representative 1 seat.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech: British Reaction</h3>
<p>Does Not Increase British Concerns</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] The "Weekly Review" criticized Hitler's speech, saying, "Hitler's words are enough to confuse us, but they will not increase our worries." These two sentences can represent the reaction of ordinary British people to Hitler's speech. The "Weekly Review" welcomed the fact that Hitler did not dare to abandon the Anglo-German naval agreement and did not issue激烈詞句. At the same time, other newspapers have译异 the fact that Hitler's speech this time was more restrained. One "People's Daily" said, "He who knows no threat is wildly咆哮, he who knows no danger of being attacked盛言 the need for people to prepare for war. However, there has never been anyone who can revive his country and 甘以一時之魯莽败一生之功業." Bassata wrote in "Weekly," saying that Hitler's speech was a weak response to Chamberlain. The speech seemed to be specifically for the country, and the words made informed people laugh. As for the 指責提之缺乏平衡, it is only enough to deceive a generation of German youth who consider Hitler as a god. "" 近期快戰 "" Said the speech was indeed restrained and had a special迷惑之空氣.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The "Sunday Times" criticized Wilhelmshaven's speech, saying: "In yesterday's speech, Hitler wanly denied that he had threatened anyone, and what he asked for was not to be interfered by others. In this regard, we sincerely hope that Hitler will first abide by it and not interfere with others. In yesterday's speech, we failed to find anything to encourage or dispel any concerns. The only hope for maintaining peace still lies in cooperation rather than isolation. If they are opposed, the strength of peace-loving countries is still the greatest."</p>
<p>London Pays Attention to the Military Section</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] London paid close attention to the section of Hitler's speech yesterday in Wilhelmshaven that mentioned British and German armaments. A detailed translation of the section of the speech is as follows: "Germany does not want to attack other countries indiscriminately. What we hope for is to expand our economic relations. We have this right. We do not want to accept the instructions of any politician in Europe or outside Europe. We are indeed reorganizing our armaments, but if other countries do not interfere with us, we do not want to attack other countries. Germany will never be suppressed by policies of intimidation or encirclement. I have signed a naval treaty with Britain. The signing of this treaty is based on our ardent desire to never fight with Britain. If Britain no longer has this desire, then the actual premise of the treaty no longer exists. Germany is very willing to tolerate this idea. We are fully confident, because we are already so strong and united. Those who have no strength will lose their right to exist. When people in other countries are now talking about expanding their armies and saying that their military expansion will never end, then I can only frankly tell those politicians that their words are not enough to bother me. I am determined to continue to advance on this path of military expansion, and I firmly believe that our military expansion will be faster than other countries. If anyone wants to compare strength with us, then the German people are always ready to deal with it. I am prepared, and I am determined."</p>
<h3>Revising the Speech, Focusing on Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Well-informed sources in Germany believe that Hitler's speech in Chexim Severn Harbor was specifically a peace speech with an attached warning to Britain. One commentator said that Hitler had declared his love of peace but at the same time warned against Chamberlain's continued encirclement policy. The commentator said, "We absolutely do not believe that this policy has any self-defensive nature. We can almost daily find examples of attempts to undermine our peaceful activities" to hinder Germany's development, the Romanian agreement signing is one example. We are prepared to realize peace, but we are absolutely dissatisfied with the encirclement policy. We cannot continue to sink like this until the item, and then think about ways to get out. The newspapers also paid attention to the danger of the "sentence garden policy" and stated that Hitler had given Britain time to carefully consider.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Officials have recently decided not to widely broadcast Hitler's speech because it could not attract a large audience at the time, so it was only recorded and broadcast again during people's meal times. It is said that the sudden interruption of the shortwave transmission to the United States was due to a mechanical failure. According to non-official opinions, Hitler's original speech was broader and more specifically addressed the United States, but after Chamberlain's speech in the British House of Commons, the entire speech was revised to focus on Britain. Therefore, the special interest in the United States no longer existed, and it was finally decided not to broadcast to the United States. Hitler is still on the "Robert Thoral" ship and is said to land in Hamburg tomorrow afternoon. In addition, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels has recently arrived in Bauders and will spend two weeks there.</p>
<h3>French Air Minister Arrives in Britain to Discuss Aircraft Manufacturing Procedures; British Chief of Staff Returns to London to Report on Talks in France</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 2nd] British Chief of Staff Goddard, after inspecting French fortresses and defenses, returned here yesterday with his entourage. It is said that Goddard will visit Prime Minister Chamberlain and Land Minister 倍立夏 for discussions and will report on the Maginot Line and his talks with General 甘末林, Commander-in-Chief of the Continued Army. It is believed that French Air Minister Shangbaier arrived in London today, which is related to the aircraft manufacturing procedures of Britain and France. The goal is to achieve a balance with the German air force in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] French Air Minister Shangbaier will arrive here tomorrow evening to have two days of talks with British Air Minister Wooda. Among those who came to Britain with Shang are also technical experts. Therefore, the content of the talks is mostly still on technical issues and not on staff matters.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan × Yielded!</h3>
<p>3rd Reuters News Agency, the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute has been completely resolved. The two countries have signed a fishing agreement for a term of one year. The establishment of this Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement is noteworthy in three aspects:</p>
<p>First, it shows that Japan × has completely yielded to the Soviet Union. Because Japan × originally wanted to . The original fishing agreement continued to be in effect. However, this new agreement forced Japan × to give up thirty fishing zones, and the Soviet Union designated ten additional zones for military reasons. Moreover, Japan must pay an additional percentage of the rent tax. In the past, the Japanese side claimed that it would not hesitate to fight if it failed to extend the fishing agreement. Now, the act of kneeling down has been staged.</p>
<p>Second, it proves the success of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, which not only forced Japan × to submit but also made the world recognize Japan ×'s outwardly fierce but inwardly weak ugly state!</p>
<p>Third, it proves that since the disastrous defeat in the Zhangguxiong campaign, Japan × has indeed lacked the courage to attack the Soviet Union. On the one hand, it can be seen that Japan × cannot simultaneously wage war against China and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, we must be careful that the Japanese will inevitably try their best to "subdue" China first. We must be wary of their military adventures, political divisions, and diplomatic inducement schemes!</p>
<h3>The Conspiracy of the Puppet Central Government</h3>
<p>The conspiracy of ×× traitors for peace, compromise, and the organization of a puppet Central British government exists with the domestic and military predicament of × people and has developed as an example. As the political, military, and diplomatic difficulties of × increase, this conspiracy becomes more and more intense. These days, the air of peace and compromise is followed by the re-emergence of the puppet Central Government conspiracy.</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai telegram from Haitong News Agency, "× People's traitor Liu is paying close attention to Wang Jingwei's statement of "giving an example" to reserve his personal right to negotiate directly with Japan. However, Wang Jingwei's statement coincides with the time when the British Ambassador to Japan is about to come to Shanghai to meet with the Chinese Ambassador. This is especially the intention of ×. On the other hand, the puppet governments in Beiping and Nanjing are hoping that the war can end as soon as possible. It is rumored that the two puppet governments have suggested the establishment of a new puppet central government with Wang as the prime minister." This news has partially revealed the recent political plans of ×.</p>
<p>The facts are very clear. We can only win by insisting on unity and resisting the war. × people use anti-communism and peace to undermine our unity and prevent our resistance. We can only have the poorest victory by sincerely supporting the leader and supporting the central government. × people use all means to provoke dissent and attempt to create a puppet central government to destroy our country. The activities of the puppet governments in the north and south and the activities of Wang Jingwei are precisely part of the × people's plan.</p>
<p>For the independence of the country and the liberation of the nation, we must not only insist on unity and resist the war and support the leader and the government, but also resolutely oppose any peace compromise and international mediation, and we must also do our best to combat any traitor puppet regime in order to defeat × people and win the final victory!</p>

<h3>× Ships are Getting Fiercer; They Broke into ×× Abusively; After a Cargo Ship in Nanwan Was Robbed, It Was Taken to Guangzhou with More Than 20 People on Board; Two Fishing Boats in Gaosha Were Sunk by × Artillery Fire and Dozens of Boatmen Died</h3>
<p>Violent × disregards international law and has been constantly sending large groups of armed wheel ships to search and loot civilian ships along the coast for the past ten days. Yesterday, a cargo boat, whose ship administration was registered in Hong Kong, was robbed by × in the ×××× sea area, and then the ship was taken away. Dozens of boatmen were not spared. After the boatmen were taken away, they were sent to Guangzhou to fill the lost jobs. Yesterday, there were people who escaped back to this port and reported to the police station. On the 31st of last month, in the Gaosha sea area of Xiangzhou, another tragic incident occurred in which two fishing boats were sunk by × artillery fire, and dozens of people on board died under the bullets. The process of the two tragic events is listed below.</p>
<p>×××× Robbery and Looting</p>
<p>According to Zeng Xiangsheng (31 years old), the owner of the ship who suffered in the ×××× sea area, who returned to Hong Kong to report, his ship was registered in Hong Kong, and the number was T-124. The work he was engaged in was the transportation of goods. On the 12th of last month, at the request of the cargo customers in Hong Kong, the ship was fully loaded with goods (worth about 3,000 yuan) and anchored in the ×××× sea area. Just as it was about to continue sailing, a × ferry boat came from Donggulang and broke into ××. When approaching the cargo boat, more than a dozen × soldiers jumped onto the cargo boat, immediately exposed their weapons and subdued everyone, and ordered a sailor to point a gun at the helmsman, forcing him to drive the ship out of the Chinese boundary, Linxi Ferry, and anchor for a week. × then dragged it to Guangzhou, drove more than 20 people on board ashore, and forced them to work as fast workers. Zeng Xiangsheng took the opportunity to escape when × soldiers were lax in their defense. He returned to this port yesterday to report to the office. The × soldiers broke into ×××× this time and wantonly searched and looted civilian ships, which is really disregarding international law.</p>
<p>Dozens of Boatmen Died in the Sea</p>
<p>According to the report received by the Fishermen's Association, on the 31st of last month, more than a dozen fishing boats were fishing in the Gaosha sea area. While they were engaged in fishing, a × warship came from Gulang. They feared that it was not a good sign, so they fled in a panic. Unexpectedly, the × warship was a hundred feet away and suddenly fired dozens of artillery shells at the fishing boat. Two of them could not avoid it and were sacrificed under the × bullets. They sank immediately in response to the sound. Dozens of people on board died in the sea. Their cruel actions are really infuriating. They were fortunate to have quickly avoided along the coast, otherwise it would have been difficult to escape.</p>

<p>Today is the most joyous Children's Day for children. Adults are as usual to celebrate the birthday of the little masters. However, the problem is immediately in front of us:</p>
<p>Let's watch a movie. Poisonous movies should not be shown to innocent children. Candies and toys. Thinking of the miserable pictures of refugee children, those with a little conscience will definitely feel that they must save money. Books and newspapers. The serial pictures of flying signatures and walls are of course poison, and even those "speaking ancient words" and "speaking adult words" books in the bookstore are not spiritual food that children need after all. Then, what else will we do for the children on Children's Day besides taking them to the commemorative meeting and telling some patriotic stories?</p>
<p>If you are giving a gift to children with great consideration, for the sake of frugality, and the children miss this day in vain, needless to say, the children will be very disappointed. If he or she is obedient, he or she will definitely ask adults and elders: "Protecting children! This is a lie! May I ask what benefits do you give us children?"</p>
<p>The problem is in front of the caring parents and elders, how can it be solved well?</p>
<p>Taking children to the bookstore to buy beneficial children's books is certainly a way. In addition, there is another good news that readers will be excited to hear.</p>
<p>The fact is this:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily publishes a "Children's Weekly" every Sunday specifically for children. It has been published for four years now and is still continuing. Because the writers are all well-known children's literature writers in China, the newspaper has become a rare children's publication in China. Enlightened parents and teachers all use the Children's Weekly of the Shanghai Daily as the spiritual food for their children or students. To facilitate readers' requests, it has also been compiled into a "Children's Friend" hardcover edition. It has long become a famous children's publication. In order to improve the level of children's literature in Hong Kong and encourage children to pay attention to extracurricular reading, this newspaper specially brought a large number of "Selected Compilations of the Shenbao Children's Special Issue: Children's Friend 1" from this newspaper in Shanghai. At the same time, in order to commemorate Children's Day, we will give another 50% discount on the lowest price. The first collection is sold for HK$0.20, the second collection is sold for HK$0.20, and the third collection is sold for HK$0.10. —This is only part of the recovery of printing costs.</p>
<p>The materials, words, and pictures of Xu Shu are all excellent children's publications from the perspective of children-oriented education. The content includes: Children's Forum, Children's Science, Labor, Common Sense, Anecdotes of Celebrities, Civic Training, Poetry, Pictures, Children's Literature, Tong Gu Stories, Recreation, Life Knowledge, Boy Scout Sleeves, Children's Creations, etc. Each collection reaches about 400 yuan in 16-mo format, and the text capacity reaches more than 100,000 words in each collection. It can be used as a reference book for teachers, as a supplementary teaching material, and also as an extracurricular reading material. It is truly a "Friend of Children" in the true sense of the word. If you spend a dime or two to buy a copy for your children, your hopes for your children, whether they are patriotic, scientific, self-cultivation, literary... will definitely embark on a bright ancestral path from now on. This is the gift of this newspaper to commemorate the Children's Day. In order to improve the level of children's literature in Hong Kong and make our next generation grow up healthily, I sincerely hope that enlightened parents and teachers will immediately use this newspaper's "Children's Friend" as a gift for children on Children's Day.</p>
<h3>A Gale Devastates Hong Kong; Many Boats Capsized; Many Men and Women Fell into the Sea but Were Rescued; Material Losses Amounted to More Than 9,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At 1:00 pm yesterday, a gale suddenly rose in this port, and the momentum was very strong. Many boats and boats on the sea, large and small, capsized due to the suddenness of the gale. Many men and women fell into the sea, but they were all rescued fortunately. The total material loss was as high as 9,477 yuan.</p>
<p>Gale Rises Suddenly; Boats Capsize and People Drown</p>
<p>It is found that six people, including Suo Fei, Bi Da Peter, Li An Saileiqi, Mi Duodun, and women Zha Feilisi, all Western employees of China Power Company, were driving the sailing ship "Adam Ma" before the gale and passing through the sea surface of Angshipu Island. Suddenly, a hurricane suddenly rose. Before they could unload, it was blown sideways by the wind. Then, another gust of wind blew it down. The men and women all fell into the sea. Fortunately, they all knew how to swim and swam to the side of the capsized ship. Together, they managed to right the 30 planks. At that time, the wind and waves were strong, and the situation was very dangerous. They waited on the boat for rescue. At half past one, a Guang'an small transport ship passed by, and they shouted loudly. The small wheel heard the sound and drove forward to rescue the six people onto the wheel. Fortunately, there were no injuries. Only Mr. Suo Fei lost 25 yuan.</p>
<p>The Number of Boats in Distress Reached Nine</p>
<p>On the same day, a total of nine boats and boats encountered danger due to the wind and reported to the Ship Administration Department and the Marine Police Department afterwards. It is said that the woman Zhang Rongmiao's boat was moored in Xudi Street, opposite the sea, and was blown down by the wind. 37 dan of scrap iron on board fell into the sea, worth 800 yuan, and another back boat, 400 yuan. The woman Zhou San's boat was also blown down while moored in the nearby sea, losing 400 bags of rice, worth 4,000 yuan. Another boat lost 300 bags of rice, worth 2,700 yuan. 17 thin pieces of paper were all soaked in water, losing 1,700 yuan. Another three bags of paper sank into the sea, losing 300 yuan.</p>
<p>The Most Material Losses Were Rice</p>
<p>On the sea opposite Kennedy Town, there were three cargo boats carrying 2,200 bags of rice. When the wind rose, the boats were blown to the stone ridge. 300 bags of rice fell into the sea, losing 3,300 yuan. In the sea area of Tseung Kwan O, a certain cargo boat was carrying live pigs, piglets, mountain goods, etc. It was blown down by the wind. The people in the boat all fell into the sea and were almost drowned. Fortunately, they held on to the capsized boat and waited for four hours before a San Da Company steamship passed by and rescued everyone. The goods that were loaded have already been washed away. In addition, the man Zhou Guifa also went to the Marine Police Department to report that his cargo boat was blown down by the wind. The boat lost 300 yuan, and the goods lost 277 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Lasting Over Two Months: Insurance Claim – Plaintiff Stops Proceedings, Willing to Settle Out of Court</h3>
<p>The Qichang Foreign Firm was sued in the High Court by Changsheng Firm, represented by two prominent lawyers, Mr. Delay, Mr. Liao Yali, Mr. Ma Zida, and Mr. An De Chen, demanding compensation for the loss of a large consignment of seafood destroyed in a fire in January 1938. The goods were insured by the Qichang Firm. Two prominent barristers, Delay, Shao Liao, Yali, Ma Zida, and An De Chen, defended the case, submitting a plea for dismissal. The case had been heard more than ten times, lasting over two months. Yesterday morning, it was heard again by Assistant Judge Mackenzie. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Hugh Da, told the judge that the plaintiff no longer wished to continue the litigation and was willing to settle out of court with the defendant. However, the court fees should be borne by the defendant. The defendant's lawyer, Shao Liao Yali, said that he could not decide on the court fees until he had consulted with the defendant. Mr. Ma Zida continued that if the defendant had any objections to the court fees, they could be raised for discussion the next day. After hearing this, Judge Mackenzie declared the case closed, ending the civil lawsuit that had lasted over two months and set a record for the length of a civil lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Public Performance: Hong Kong Government Staff Association's "Phoenix City" – Fundraising to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Government Staff Association has always been at the forefront of various charitable causes. In the past, it has achieved remarkable results in purchasing bonds and donating to disaster relief. Now, taking advantage of the anniversary celebration, it is staging the four-act anti-Japanese war drama "Phoenix City," which will be performed in a theater soon. All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to help refugees. The play "Phoenix City" was written by playwright Wu Yeguang and published by the Life Bookstore. It depicts the stories of Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army leaders Ma Zhanshan, Miao Kexiu, Zhao Tong, etc., filled with grief, indignation, and stimulation, making it a worthy wake-up call for us. To increase fundraising income, the association has specially hired Li Chenfeng to serve as director, and Madam Tang Rong Kunyu (playing Miao Kexiu's wife, Xia Wanbing) and Madam Cen Qiu Sanniang Hu Baoyan, among others, are participating in the leading roles. The first preview was held at the association last night at eight o'clock, and the results were excellent.</p>

<h3>Save Our Children!</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiong</p>
<p>Talking About Hong Kong Children on Children's Day – Please Don't Forget the Poor Children in the Grand Celebration</p>
<p>The annual Children's Day arrives with the warm spring. On this day of great significance, we know that many happy children are holding grand celebrations, meetings, speeches, performances, and exchanging gifts, all full of joy and vitality. However, we must also know that besides this small group of happy children, there are countless unfortunate and poor children, struggling in small rooms, in factories, on street corners, under arcades, striving for survival, and living in terrible environments, experiencing misery and suffering. Moreover, their number is many times greater than that of the happy children. They are also the future masters of the country and the nation, and we cannot forget them in our grand commemoration.</p>
<p>I bring a group of children who would rather not speak because they are dirty to the readers, causing the readers to frown, turn their heads, sigh, and then talk about the children of the general middle and upper classes, which is already enough to make people sigh!</p>
<p>"Every inch of land is precious, and twenty or thirty people live on one floor. Under such an environment, the health of Hong Kong children has been fundamentally shaken. Let's see, how many children in middle-class families have their own room, or even their own bed? It is common for a mother and four or five children to share a bed, and for brothers to share a 'double bunk' and sisters to share a bed.</p>
<p>If living is like this, what about eating? It is probably not much better than living. The cost of living is so high, and the citizens have to pay rent that is already so high that it cannot be higher. In fact, the "adult" landlord can increase it at any time; they have to socialize, support the face of a small citizen; they have to wear beautiful clothes... Under heavy burden, are they still able to pay special attention to what the children eat? What the adults eat, the children eat, whether it is nutritious or not, who cares.</p>
<p>Cheap and inferior snacks sold on the streets have harmed countless of our children!</p>
<p>Clothes, except for the children of a few aristocratic families who are dressed a little beautifully, are generally very poor. It is rare to be able to be clean and decently dressed.</p>
<p>Going out? Heavens! How many children in Hong Kong are innocently injured or killed by cars on the road every year? We only know that "the road is like a tiger's mouth," but why do we let the "city tigers" roam around? Is it possible that people with cars, the servants of the car-owning class—the drivers—are special?</p>
<p>In addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, there is school. An ordinary residential building is mixed in with a 'residential school,' the blackboard is black, and the desks and chairs are black... In the dimness, forty or fifty children gather together and recite "The Master said..." and write "The Great Man Above..."</p>
<p>A small floor is a classroom, a playground... it is everything. Larger schools also only have a 'veranda' used as a ping-pong room and library, and a small open space as a playground. There are such magnificent and comfortable clubs, tea houses, and taverns in Hong Kong... but there are such dilapidated schools.</p>
<p>In such an environment, the life of our future masters, our little angels, ah! It's so pitiful! But please don't sigh yet, there is a large group that is even more pitiful and miserable than the ones mentioned above.</p>
<p>Boys and girls running early in the morning on the streets, shouting, "×× newspaper × newspaper..." Boys and girls near the markets—like Graham Street in Central, the market in Sheung Wan, the market in Wan Chai, the market in Sai Ying Pun, the market in Yau Ma Tei...—holding vegetables, scallions, garlic, melons... trying to sell them to people. They are all 'monkey-like' and 'vegetable-colored,' dressed in rags, and very dirty. Running around from morning to night, the most fortunate day, they earn no more than three or four dimes.</p>
<p>We all know, right! What they are doing is "illegal" because they have not obtained a license. The 'law-abiding' police can arrest and fine them at any time. There are many such cases, and a judge publicly discussed them not long ago.</p>
<p>What about the future masters and citizens who are used to living a "law-breaking" life? This is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>Those who share the same fate also include:</p>
<p>Shoe-shining children, they are boys aged fourteen or fifteen, six or seven, and even three or four, holding a "shoe-shining box" made of broken wooden clogs and old box boards, two boxes of shoe polish, an old bristle brush, and a few rags, squatting on the street to make a living.</p>
<p>It costs two cents to shine a pair of shoes. By shining twenty or thirty pairs a day, they could earn more than four dimes. However, there are too many people looking for a living like this. In Hong Kong and Kowloon combined, there are at least two thousand five hundred people. "There are more monks than porridge." Some people shine a pair of shoes for a penny, and many don't even earn a dime all day long!</p>
<p>At night, there are many girls in thin clothes, with pale faces and a small yellow braid, holding corsage flowers at the entrance of dance halls, trying to sell them to gentlemen who come to have fun. They are shivering in the north wind. Only a few lucky ones are pitied by a dancer who gives her a five-cent nickel for a corsage flower.</p>
<p>There are many little beggars, with dirty faces, snotty noses, bare buttocks, and bare feet, four or five years old, who can be seen at the entrance of every theater, restaurant, department store...</p>
<p>Late at night after twelve o'clock, in front of big hotels and dance halls, there are many such beggars doing somersaults on the ground, continuously all the way, rushing to ask for money from the honored guests... In the dirtiest and darkest corners of the city, there are more than one hundred thousand pitiful children living on the hunger line.</p>
<p>They are the future masters, no one can deny this. Why do we have the heart to let our future masters encounter such a pitiful life? Let Lu Xun tell us: —</p>
<p>'Save the children!'</p>

<h3>Work Report of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association</h3>
<p>I. Establishment Process</p>
<p>Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the war zone has expanded daily, and wherever the enemy's iron hooves reached, homes were reduced to ruins. The orphans of our nation's defenders and the young children in the disaster areas were either killed by the Japanese invaders or died from hunger and cold. Furthermore, there were many displaced, armless, and legless individuals everywhere. Particularly tragic was the fact that many young and uneducated children were transported by the Japanese invaders to the rear areas to implement their insidious policy of "using Chinese to invade China."</p>
<p>Children are the lifeblood of the nation and the key to the prosperity of the people. To alleviate the burdens of our compatriots and eliminate the worries of our fighters, thereby achieving the goals of national resistance and reconstruction and fulfilling the aspirations for national revival, we must provide practical guarantees and comprehensive education for the millions of children trapped in the disaster areas.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, President of the Association, initiated a nationwide movement to establish the Wartime Children's Welfare Association in Hankou, taking in over a dozen orphans and establishing branches in various provinces to facilitate rescue efforts nearby.</p>
<p>In April of last year, the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association received instructions from the General Association and immediately mobilized local women to start preparations. Three meetings were held over three weeks to draft the articles of association and write the declaration. On the afternoon of May 11th of last year, at 3:00 PM, the establishment was announced. Officers were elected in accordance with the articles of association, and tasks were divided among the groups. Prominent figures in society were appointed as honorary directors for consultation. The office was initially located at the Women's War Relief Association and was later moved to the Women's Comfort Association in November of last year.</p>
<p>Since its establishment half a year ago, thanks to the support of people from all walks of life, progress has been very smooth. As we compile and print the report on the Association's work and financial income and expenditures for the past six months, we will briefly describe its establishment process here.</p>
<p>II. Sources of Funding</p>
<p>Originally, an organization has two prerequisite questions when it begins: the first is the issue of location, and the second is the issue of start-up costs.</p>
<p>Regarding the previous question, the Women's War Relief Association borrowed a room for office use, which was considered resolved. Regarding the latter question, the Women's Comfort Association donated HK$200 as start-up funds, which was also considered resolved.</p>
<p>With these two prerequisite questions resolved, our organization can be said to have had some basic framework.</p>
<p>On May 19th, the Association's second standing committee meeting resolved to invite Dr. Mei Lanfang to volunteer to raise funds for the Association. He agreed to the request, and on the 28th and 29th of the same month, he performed a play to raise funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic help of people from all walks of life, more than 15,000 yuan was raised. At the same time, honorary directors were responsible for the expenses of five or more children, and directors were responsible for the expenses of one or more children. Letters were also sent to various community schools to sponsor the expenses of five or more children in the name of the organization. In addition, there were many private donations. As for donations of goods, there were also frequent occurrences every day. These are all sources of funding for the Association. The detailed figures for financial income and expenditure are reported separately by the Finance Committee, so I won't go into further detail here.</p>
<p>III. Establishment Process of the First Orphanage</p>
<p>The Association raised more than 10,000 yuan in charity funds, plus about 10,000 yuan in children's protection fees donated by directors and sponsoring organizations, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. So it began to set up the orphanage and looked for an address in early June of last year.</p>
<p>Initially, the Guangdong Provincial Government allocated a building of the Shenzhen Hotel, which was quite spacious and could accommodate more than 1,000 people. After the members of the "Economic Design" team went to see it twice, they all felt that the house was close to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where enemy aircraft frequently came and went. In addition, it had been in disrepair for a long time and was quite leaky. It was estimated that repairs would cost about 6,000 yuan. For safety and economic reasons, although the allocation was appreciated, it was ultimately not used. At the same time, enthusiastic people from all sides sent letters, willing to offer their ancestral halls or villas for free, or introducing their relatives' houses for use. However, either the transportation was inconvenient, or there were too many mosquitoes, so they were not borrowed. The Association is extremely grateful for the enthusiastic support of the people of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Later, it was decided to borrow the Po Oi Hospital in Yuen Long. The hospital was originally run by gentlemen from Yuen Long, including Deng Boqiu, Cai Baozhu, Deng Weitang, Wu Hua, etc. Mr. Deng and others were always enthusiastic about charity work. This time, they generously agreed to let out the entire upstairs and downstairs living room of the hospital to the Association for use as the first orphanage, which is especially appreciated. A cleaning room was added next to the house, and it was officially opened in mid-July, with Ms. He Ailing appointed as the director to manage all the orphanage affairs.</p>
<p>The first orphanage accommodated a total of 83 children. In addition to a small number who were taken in in Hong Kong, most were sent by the Refugee Relief Association's Guangdong branch.</p>
<p>As for the personnel in the orphanage, they followed the General Association's purpose and used the most economical method to try to employ as few people as possible. In addition to a warden who managed hygiene affairs, other assistant nurses, teachers, general affairs personnel, and workers all performed multiple tasks. The only regret is that due to the limited space, many people could not be accommodated.</p>
<p>IV. Establishment Process of the Second Orphanage</p>
<p>Because the site of the first orphanage was small, accommodating more than 80 children already felt too crowded, and there were still many external requests for continued accommodation. Moreover, since the full-scale war of resistance began, the disaster areas have expanded daily. Since the hospital is in a safe area, it should accommodate more children. In addition, the Association's planned 500 people was only the first step in the work, so although the first hospital was established, the preparation for the second hospital could not be delayed.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the same time as the first hospital was established, the search for the site of the second hospital began. First, the government was requested to allocate 100,000 square feet of open space. The land bureau officials led the group to see more than a dozen open spaces in the New Territories for several days. In the end, the open spaces in the New Territories were all planting areas with many mosquitoes. The ancestral hall and empty houses closer to Kowloon were too small to accommodate many people.</p>
<p>In August of last year, Wuhan was under machine pressure and evacuated the population, and the General Association rescued thousands of refugees in the occupied city. At that time, for safety reasons, they were immediately sent to Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming and other inland areas. At the time, the refugees were already on their way, so the establishment of the second hospital was even more urgent, and the personnel sent to escort them totaled 350 people. When the General Association received the telegram, they immediately contacted all parties overnight to arrange for accommodation. Mr. Zhou Zhaowu, the chief executive of Tung Wah Hospital, accompanied the Association's staff to the Chinese Civil Affairs Department to request a solution. As a result, they agreed to lease Block B of the old National Hospital for the Association's use.</p>
<p>When the batch of refugees set off from Wuhan, they were escorted by 10 scouts and 4 staff members from Wuhan. When they passed through Guangzhou, the local Women's Comfort Association hosted them and dispatched scouts to escort them. They arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of September 9th of last year. However, it took several days to travel from Hankou to Guangzhou. The journey was already hard, and they had to take refuge in air raids along the way, going down to the army several times. As a result, a few of the weaker children became ill upon arrival in Hong Kong. The reception staff from the Association immediately sent them to the hospital for treatment and transported the other children to the Xian Shu College. Since there were so many children and they were old, and they all spoke northern languages, except for the escorts, all the nurses, teachers, and general affairs personnel were hired from the north to reduce the gap and prevent malpractice. However, it was difficult to find such talents in Hong Kong, so it took half a month for the hospital to establish its internal organization.</p>
<p>However, the old National Hospital was originally used by the Hong Kong government for the annual winter refugee shelter, and the maximum time it could be lent to the Association was only three months. Since the permanent address of the hospital had not yet been decided, it was agreed with the Hong Kong government to designate Diamond Hill near Kowloon as the site of the hospital. This matter was also agreed to by the Association's advisor, Hu Wenhu. Unexpectedly, the result of the negotiation was another disappointment because the government was going to reserve it for a dairy farm.</p>
<p>In December of last year, the Hong Kong government was unable to allocate Diamond Hill and agreed to lend a part of the newly built refugee camp in Ma Tau Chung, Kowloon, to the Association for use as the second hospital. However, this was also temporary, so it was decided to request the Hong Kong government to allocate the open space on the right side of the refugee camp, which was about 90,000 square feet, for self-construction. At the same time, honorary advisors of the Association, Luo Xuzhao, Luo Wenjin, and Zhou Shoushen, were asked to make strong contact with the Hong Kong government, and Mr. Situ Yongjue also assisted from the sidelines. Finally, at the end of December, the Legislative Council officially approved the loan for a period of three years and was allowed to be extended to nine years. This time, the Association was able to achieve such satisfactory results, which was naturally due to the enthusiasm of the advisors and the trust of the Hong Kong government in the Association. The Association should especially thank them.</p>
<p>V. Establishment Process of the Third Orphanage</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the number of refugees in the New Territories increased sharply, and abandoned children were everywhere. The head nurse and staff of the first orphanage rescued them at any time and temporarily kept them in the first orphanage for care. At the same time, other charitable organizations also took back the abandoned children for care. At that time, the Hong Kong government believed that it was difficult to concentrate the power to take care of the children in separate groups, and it was difficult to complete the care, so it decided to hand over the batch of children to the Association for management. As a result of negotiations between Mrs. Situ Yongjue and Director He Ailing, the Hong Kong government lent a maternity ward of the old National Hospital for use as the third Ruan.</p>
<p>After the third Ruan was opened, the first Ruan transferred 10 newly and old accommodated infants, plus more than 70 children sent by charitable organizations.</p>
<p>From then on, the children accommodated in the first Ruan were between 2 and 6 years old, the second Ruan was designated for children between Xuesui and 14 years old, and the third Ruan was purely for infants. This made the work of each Ruan easier, and the manpower and financial resources could be more economical.</p>
<p>VI. Preparation Process for the Permanent Address</p>
<p>The addresses of the first, second, and third Ruan mentioned above were all obtained with the assistance of various parties. During this long-term war of resistance, the work of the Association was certainly not temporary. Everyone believed that the experience and effectiveness of running children's orphanages in the past made it necessary to exist and expand permanently. The Kowloon Ma Longtou oil-more than 10,000 feet of land previously granted by the Hong Kong government was indeed quite wide, but it was limited in time. This not only had no guarantee on future construction costs, but also had to be relocated after the expiration of the term, which was considered inappropriate. On the same day, it purchased a piece of land at the junction of Fanling and Sheung Shui, which required more than 30,000 feet and cost 14,000 yuan. It could accommodate 500 children. Now that the land has been purchased by Mr. Hu and donated to the Association for use as a construction orphanage, the first and most important problem that the Association considered before has been completely and satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu has now handed over the construction affairs to the Yong An Tang office, which is planning the dormitory classrooms, medical room, library, gymnasium, workshop, farm, auditorium, science laboratory, bath room, toilet, etc. As soon as the survey is clear, it will soon be able to publish the report and call for workers to vote for construction. (In the future, when the construction is completed, our children will also raise a glass to Mr. Hu for his birthday.) Since the establishment of the Association for less than 11 months, it has accommodated more than 400 children and borrowed 3 orphanage sites, all of which have received the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. As for the Association's permanent address this time, it is entirely due to Mr. Hu Wenhu's generous donation. On the occasion of the Association's work report, the 400 orphans would like to thank all the sponsors!</p>
<h3>Commemorating Children's Day and Developing Children's Work</h3>
<p>— Liu Qingxuan</p>
<p>As the war lengthens and the war zones expand, the cruel devastation suffered by Chinese children increases daily. Therefore, rescuing war orphans and protecting children are crucial tasks for upholding a sustained war of resistance.</p>
<p>Children are the future generations of our nation. They are a force for fighting the war to the end and striving for final victory, and they are the capital for building a new country. Since the start of the war of resistance, to protect future generations and rescue war orphans in the war zones, we have organized the China Children's Protection Association and the Wartime Children's Relief Association, establishing branches in various regions. This is an important step in coordination with upholding the war of resistance. Simultaneously, to organize the strength of children, children's organizations have been established in various regions.</p>
<p>However, up to now, our work in rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children's propaganda is far behind objective needs and has not yet exerted the effectiveness it should. Today, as we celebrate Chinese Children's Day, we should conduct a review to serve as a basis for our future improvements and enrichment.</p>
<p>First, we should point out that the reason children's work has not exerted its due effectiveness and cannot meet the demands of the war of resistance is based on the fact that the mobilization of the entire nation has not yet met the needs of the war of resistance. However, the lack of effort on the part of children's workers is a significant problem.</p>
<p>Second, rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children require a comprehensive plan to achieve significant results. Currently, we lack a comprehensive plan, so the work remains superficial and has not been expanded or deepened.</p>
<p>Third, rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and organizing children are integral parts of active war resistance work. However, some colleagues only treat it as passive relief and neglect its active significance, thus failing to improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>These are just some of the shortcomings I personally feel. In the future, we should promote work such as rescuing, protecting, and organizing children in a planned manner, improve work efficiency, and break incorrect perceptions of children's work. Only in this way can the work of rescuing, protecting, and organizing children exert its due effectiveness.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong is located outside the front lines, due to its geographical relationship, it is close to the mainland's zone of war. Therefore, effectively carrying out the work of rescuing war orphans and protecting children is the responsibility of every compatriot living abroad. We must not only uphold a sustained war of resistance and leverage the vast land and abundant resources of our Chinese nation, but also do everything possible to rescue and protect the second generation of our nation, cultivate the nation's vitality, and serve as capital for war resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>Today, as we celebrate Children's Day, we should take on the responsibility of rescuing war orphans, protecting children, and further organizing children with a fighting spirit, so that children in the war zones can be rescued. At the same time, we appeal to peace-loving people around the world to ××××××××××× and assist Chinese children in distress. This is a task that we, as compatriots living outside the front lines, must urgently carry out!</p>
<h3>How to Spend This Year's Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Fan Zheng</p>
<p>This is a work by a young member of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, who recently arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland. He is only thirteen years old this year and was originally a member of the Xin'an Traveling Troupe. After the war of resistance, he traveled to various places in the mainland and made significant contributions to the work of salvation propaganda. In this short article, we can see how Chinese children are growing up amidst the flames of war and how they, like adults, are doing their best to dedicate themselves to the struggle for national liberation! — The Editor</p>
<p>How joyful and meaningful it is to celebrate our own festival during the war of resistance!</p>
<p>"Children's Day" is our own festival for us children. We should think of ways to make this festival very meaningful.</p>
<p>Recalling past Children's Days, they were meaningless. We would just hold a meeting, listen to the lectures of the adults, shout a few slogans ourselves, and then the school would buy some sweets, towels, etc., to distribute to everyone for fun, as if that was how these "little masters" were celebrating the festival—we feel that such celebrations are meaningless to us?</p>
<p>If we want to have a happy Children's Day, we must do it ourselves and contribute our own small strength.</p>
<p>Now, the children in the interior are celebrating Children's Day on their own. They have their own groups, and there are also general children's organizations. When they have work to do, representatives from many groups meet to discuss plans and arrange work.</p>
<p>Take Guilin in Guangxi, for example (I just came out of the Xin'an Traveling Troupe, a children's organization in Guilin, to join the China Salvation Drama Troupe). There are seven children's groups there. They have a symposium to discuss how to carry out work. This time, to celebrate Children's Day, they must do a great job.</p>
<p>They have their own people as chairpersons, performing dramas and singing, creating street bulletins, and cartoons, … doing work. They don't want any sweets, but the work they do is sweeter than sweets!</p>
<p>In a big city like Hong Kong, apart from schools, there are very few children's groups. If the children in the mainland knew about this, they would definitely laugh; of course, there are special difficulties. But we must overcome all difficulties and bring out our own strength.</p>
<p>Dear children, Hong Kong seems to be lifeless. Some compatriots are still living in a drunken dream. They don't care about the war of resistance at all. Some even advocate peace like Wang Jingwei—we children must become small alarm clocks to wake up these people in their dreams!</p>
<p>To commemorate Children's Day, we must organize ourselves and become small soldiers of the Chinese nation, competing with the children in the mainland who are doing salvation work to see who does better. - On the eve of Children's Day by the China Salvation Drama Troupe.</p>

<h3>Starting with "Night-Shining Cup"</h3>
<p>— Li Qinian</p>
<p>We all know that Cantonese films, due to talent and financial constraints, inevitably tend to be somewhat careless in terms of technology. However, this carelessness leads to increased disappointment among viewers with higher standards. As a result, some company owners believe that serious viewers do not watch Cantonese films. This leads to even more careless efforts to cater to the tastes of low-level viewers, resulting in numerous deviations. Consequently, they are criticized and rejected by public opinion and society, and some even believe that Cantonese films are being used by × people to numb viewers. I believe both of these points contain considerable errors: On the part of the company owners, they do not know to raise the standards of Cantonese films to attract serious viewers, and instead, they make careless films to cater to careless viewers. This is a major mistake that everyone knows. On the part of public opinion, they adopt a critical or dismissive attitude because Cantonese films are of low quality, refusing to discuss them at all. This is not a good strategy either. To expand propaganda among the broad masses and to correct the decline of Cantonese films, I believe that public opinion should offer more criticism of Cantonese films, praising what is good and directly pointing out what is bad. We must turn carelessness into seriousness, so that Cantonese films can fulfill their important cultural propaganda role in this war of resistance!</p>
<p>I am filming "Night-Shining Cup." This is truly considered a fortunate event. When last year, everyone was competing to make films based on folk tales, I was still a long-term actor at Nanyang Company. I was truly afraid of being caught up in this whirlpool. Fortunately, the owner of Nanyang Company treated me well, understanding my personality and knowing my reluctance towards those meaningless popular scripts. Therefore, he chose this famous national defense script, "Night-Shining Cup," for me to film. This is a good attempt. Although I dare not say what kind of harvest I have gained from this film, I always feel that my emotions are consistent with the characters in the play, without the drawback of stiffness. After filming, Director Gao Lihong gave me a copy of Mr. Jing's original book "Night-Shining Cup," and wrote a few words: "In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, I collaborated with Ms. Nian to produce this film. Due to Ms. Shi's efforts, we achieved unexpected success. I hereby express my gratitude." Indeed, when I was filming this film, on the one hand, I was doing my best for the responsibility of my profession, and on the other hand, I always believed that the way for us film people to serve the country lies in filming meaningful films. If I can portray the inner world of the characters in the play one by one, so that I can touch the hearts of the public, then it will be of small help to the propaganda for the war of resistance and national construction. When filming "Night-Shining Cup," I often thought like this in my heart. Therefore, as Mr. Gao said, I did put in effort, and it was what I should do, but I dare not accept what he said about "success."</p>
<p>In "Night-Shining Cup," from beginning to end, I was very satisfied. Therefore, I once wrote a small essay saying that if we could avoid inspection and cutting, then this film would not fail in any way. However, after it was released, I watched it. I really had a bit of a headache. Many important parts were all gone. What is the reason for this? Please think about it, viewers! I know that many viewers who do not understand the content must be very surprised and think that the editing of this film is so poor. But they do not know that the reason for this is another reason!</p>
<p>In the past, some stage plays have failed when they were brought to the screen. We believe that this cannot be blamed on the script. I always believe that this "Night-Shining Cup," which has a very strong sense of national defense, is unsatisfactory only because it was cut too much and messed up.</p>
<p>I believe that national defense films are not incapable of attracting viewers. As long as we strictly review ourselves, put more effort into filming, expand the propaganda of this sense of responsibility and create a movement, so that serious viewers pay attention to it and believe that Cantonese films can also occupy a position in terms of artistic standards, then the atmosphere will naturally change. Business opportunities will also come.</p>

In the second game, He used softness to control and endurance to cope, and tied the game with a score of seven to five. In the last game, Li exerted his strength too early and lacked stamina.

Yesterday, they defeated Ji Li and Bin, a pair, with two consecutive victories of nine to seven and six to four.</p>

He was down-to-earth and steady, and he was slightly better than Li in strength. Intercepting and long shots often made Li run to block. However, Li played extremely hard, but unfortunately he often missed the net, and intercepting and slashing balls often fell into a desperate situation. He then reversed the defeat with a tie, and won with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle between the two sides, Li dismounted and exerted his power, and immediately used left and right strokes, which he often took advantage of, and lost with a score of one to six first. In the second game, he took advantage of the victory and once took the lead with a score of 4 to 1. At this point, He was aroused his ambition, and in order to save the difficulty, he desperately fought back, slashing and attacking, and also tried his best to hold on. Li was only caught by the vigor of the whole spirit, and caught up head-on. In the fierce battle to the score of four to five, He first made short contact, and then took advantage of the fierce attack. Li did not know his intention, so he was taken advantage of and turned the score back to seven to six. The turning point was also in this.</p>
<p>In the second final, Li's strength gradually weakened, and he lacked stamina. He often needed flaws. He was happy and happy, and split three levels with force. Li Guangjun was in a desperate situation when he greeted the interception, so He won the first game with a score of six to three.</p>

<h3>Desiring a Champion's Position, South China B Must Win: Today's Match Against Scots at So Kon Po Field. Later at 5 PM, South China A Also Plays Scots</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Today's football league features a South China brothers double-header against Scots, with the B team playing at 3:30 PM and the A team at 5 PM, both at So Kon Po Field.</p>
<p>The outcome of the A team match is no longer of great importance, but it will proceed as scheduled. If South China A fields its full strength, they should be able to win and complete their final match.</p>
<p>In the B team match, Scots is already lagging behind in points, so the result is not crucial for them. However, this is not the case for South China. They see this match as a championship final. If they win, they will reclaim the B team championship, which has been absent from our team for many years. If they unfortunately lose, even second place will be out of reach. Even a draw and the loss of a point would put them equal in points with the 5th Battalion Royal Artillery and the Middlesex Regiment, requiring a play-off to determine the champion and runner-up. In short, South China must win today. The latest standings of the top three teams are listed below. (Hu Feng)</p>

<h3>From Children's Day to the Children's Welfare Association</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaoying</p>
<p>What is Children's Day? Simply put, it's a day of commemoration for deeply protecting children. Why do children need protection? Because children are the future masters of the nation and the reserve force for national liberation. Didn't the philosopher Laplato say, "As are the people, so is the nation"? Meaning, "To have a better nation, we must first have better citizens." We know that today's citizens grew from yesterday's children, and we also know that tomorrow's citizens are nurtured and shaped from today's children. So, if we want to know what tomorrow's citizens will be like, we only need to look at how they are being cultivated now, which is to say, how they are being nurtured. This is very clear.</p>
<p>In the past, the responsibility for nurturing children rested primarily on the shoulders of mothers. However, what mothers provide is family education, a part of education that is completely different from the socialized nature of child welfare. It's even more different from the nature of welfare during wartime. Therefore, socialized welfare and militarized welfare involve gathering a large number of children in one place, without distinction. They are given strict social and military education, which, in addition to intellectual development, emphasizes spiritual education and physical training. This cultivates healthy citizens and lays the foundation for national revival. Because a "healthy citizen" refers to all adult people of a nation, to win the final victory of the nation and build a free and happy country, all citizens must unite and fight with blood and flesh. This kind of national struggle cannot be achieved by a small number of people, nor can it be achieved by ordinary education. Therefore, the socialized and militarized education that we need now requires all women to share this responsibility.</p>
<p>For these young masters of the nation and the reserve force for national liberation, we should not only love them, but also enlighten their national consciousness and instill anti-Japanese war education, so that they have the ability to shoulder the task of defending the nation and reviving the nation. Therefore, our method of caring is called "welfare."</p>
<p>Since the start of the anti-Japanese war, I have traveled from the war zone through many difficulties to Hong Kong. I believe that since our uncles and brothers have all gone to the front lines to fight, our aunts and sisters, even if they don't have the strength to carry guns, should also shoulder the important responsibility of caring for children in the rear. Moreover, since the beginning of the all-out war of resistance, wherever I have gone, I have seen the orphans of soldiers who died for their country and the young children trapped in disaster areas. The number of children who have * * * * * * * * * * and died from epidemics or starvation is unknown. And the children who are missing arms and legs and are displaced can be seen everywhere. Especially terrible is that the * are actively using the vicious strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese," * * * * * * * * *, * * * *, providing them with enslaved education, so that the * who will attack our great Chinese nation in the future are actually a group of children who we consider to be the most beloved and pitiful today. When I think of this, I cannot help but shed tears. Therefore, as soon as I unpacked my luggage, I quickly joined this work of caring for children.</p>
<p>In essence, women and children are inseparable, like links in a chain. Children cannot receive the loving and considerate care they need if they are separated from women. And women cannot participate in social work if they are not liberated from the family. Therefore, to enable half of the nation's women to participate in the work of national salvation, we must liberate them from the shackles of the family. The purpose of the Wartime Children's Welfare Association that we have established is to have a small number of women take on the work of caring for children, so that the majority of women can organize independently and stand on their own. The orphans of soldiers fighting in the war, the children from the war zone, and the children of refugees whose parents died in the *'s artillery fire and whose children are wandering the streets are all our urgent tasks and the responsibility of the Wartime Children's Welfare Association. To date, we have indeed achieved some results in our work, but there is still much more to be done. Moreover, the war zone is expanding, and there are hundreds of thousands of afflicted children. It is impossible for * Welfare Association alone to shoulder this important responsibility. Therefore, we not only hope to enrich the quality of existing education, but we also want to expand its quantity. We not only hope for the enthusiastic support of society, but we also hope that women in Hong Kong will put aside their entertainment and participate in the work of protecting wartime children, protecting the future masters of the nation.</p>
<p>Recently, a priest in the New World named Flanagan founded a Boys Town, specializing in educating homeless children. He not only provides them with food and shelter, but also educates and molds their character. His goal is to reduce the number of vagrants in society and increase the number of good citizens—good citizens. This Boys Town can serve as a mirror for us. Today is Children's Day. I am ashamed of my lack of talent and have nothing to offer, so I encourage myself with this and also encourage my sisters!</p>
<h3>A Humble Plea to Our Overseas Compatriots!</h3>
<p>— Wu Yanzhuang</p>
<p>—Written in Commemoration of the April 4th Children's Day—</p>
<p>I remember that on the day the China Wartime Children's Association was established in Hankou last year, Madame Chiang said, "Children's welfare is by no means an ordinary and commonplace task, but a fundamental task that is closely related to the nation and the people. Children are the future citizens and the seedlings of the nation. In peacetime, they should already be loved very much, let alone in wartime, when a large number of national soldiers are sacrificing themselves. If we do not cultivate children well, how can we make up for the losses to the nation?"</p>
<p>Today, the anti-Japanese war has entered its second stage, a most critical moment for the survival of the nation, and it is also in the midst of the prelude to the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction and revival. With excited and enthusiastic hearts, and with the indomitable will to sacrifice the individual and jointly face the nation's difficulties, we commemorate Children's Day. We cannot help but think of the brave soldiers at the front who are loyally fighting and shedding blood on the battlefield. We cannot help but express our spirit of loving the country and caring for children thoroughly in our work and careers as a commemorative offering.</p>
<p>Since the International Child Welfare Association convened its first conference in Geneva in August 1925 and adopted the basic principles for protecting children, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States decided to designate one day each year as a day to commemorate children. In our country, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the China Child Welfare Association suggested that the National Government issue a decree designating April 4th as Children's Day. Since then, there has been a warm commemoration throughout the country every year.</p>
<p>We know that how to develop children's innate abilities, how to transform children's environment, and how to promote children's physical fitness are the most important and urgent matters for modern civilized countries. In particular, in today's harsh environment of foreign aggression, we can more deeply appreciate that our children are not only the continuation of our lives, but also the continuation of the life of the nation. Sun Yat-sen also said, "Our youth are our continuing life." We keep the Premier's last words in mind and feel even more strongly the importance of our responsibility. We should redouble our efforts in child welfare work, and this is the true meaning of commemoration.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the tragic plight of our refugee children during the difficult process of these twenty months of the anti-Japanese war; everyone knows the efforts and hard work of our government in rescuing children in the war zone; and everyone also knows the child welfare work that the Wartime Children's Association has done in the year since its establishment. But let us think, this war is a total confrontation between justice and fairness and violence and power, and it is also a total review of the manpower and material resources of our nation. To support the week's long anti-Japanese war, we need to fully protect our children. To complete our great task of building a new China, we need to fully protect our children!</p>
<p>The so-called "welfare" means that both "protection" and "nurturing" must be done together. The two are mutually causal and mutually supportive. "Protection" cannot be done without "nurturing," and vice versa. This is a natural cause and effect. However, it is futile to have only "protection" without "nurturing." To complete our work of "protection" and "nurturing," we must rely on a large amount of material support. This depends on the enthusiastic support of our compatriots at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Our overseas compatriots, residing in distant lands, care about their motherland. In the past, they have had a glorious history of supporting revolutionary work. This time, as we struggle for the freedom of the entire nation, our compatriots are enthusiastically dedicating their hard-earned savings and material resources to the country. This is worthy of respect from people across the country. In this short article, I will not bring up many specialized issues related to child welfare for research. I only wish to express my sincere feelings and plead with our overseas compatriots on behalf of the millions of refugee children in our war zone and to express my sincere gratitude. We look forward to more spiritual encouragement and material assistance. This is not only fortunate for our children, but also fortunate for the future of our nation!</p>

<h3>Commemorating Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Hu Mulan</p>
<p>The Difficult Responsibility We Should Bear</p>
<p>Today is such a joyful and commemorative day, our Republic of China's Children's Day. Children are the foundation of a nation's survival and the future masters of the nation. The significance of commemorating Children's Day is truly great. Our country designated April 4th as Children's Day only in the 21st year of the Republic of China, at the request of the China Child Welfare Association, and the Ministry of Education formulated and promulgated commemorative measures. After the general order, commemorative activities were held every year on April 4th in primary schools, kindergartens, and social education institutions across the country, and Children's Day was born in China.</p>
<p>The purpose of commemorating Children's Day is to encourage children's interests, inspire children's love for groups, love for the country, and love for the family, and to arouse social attention to children's undertakings and welfare work. Society should stand in a position of actively supporting and maintaining it, so that children can obtain the greatest happiness. The government should try its best to expand children's welfare undertakings. This can be said to be a truism, which everyone knows, but in today's situation of * invasion and serious national crisis, the most urgent task for us to commemorate Children's Day is to relieve refugee children.</p>
<p>Our war of resistance has been going on for one year and nine months, and the occupied areas will reach half of the territory. Due to the vastness of the occupied areas, the number of compatriots who have been displaced has increased day by day. The number of lovely children who followed their parents to flee and were deprived of education or who were not taken care of is countless. We often see reports of * army * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * on the newspaper. Our children will become the reserve soldiers of * country, our children will become the foundation of * country's survival * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, when we commemorate Children's Day, the biggest and most important thing is to find ways to relieve refugee children. First, for children in the occupied areas, people should be sent immediately to try to rescue them as much as possible and move them to safe areas. In places close to the war zone, the families of soldiers on expeditions; Children without carers should also be transferred to safe areas first. Second, the rescued children should try their best to arrange them properly and give them appropriate education according to their age. Infants should pay attention to nursing, those of primary school age should be allowed to go to school, and those who are older should be allowed to learn production skills and receive military training. These examples are only a rough summary. Effective implementation must await detailed planning. However, we can say with certainty that this work is to seek happiness for children and also for the welfare of society and the country. It can also be said that rescuing a child in the war zone is tantamount to cultivating a new force for the country. The China Relief of Refugee Children Association was established in Hankou last year, and all the work is being actively promoted. Today, as we commemorate Children's Day, we see that the most urgent and important relief work for refugee children is already underway, which is indeed a most gratifying thing, but such an important work cannot be done by the government or a small number of people. It is possible to get things done; the various parties in the society must unanimously be responsible for participating in order to achieve a magnificent effect. I hope that my compatriots who are suspended in Hong Kong's young children's undertakings will pay attention to the tragic suffering of the war zone and share the responsibility of relieving refugee children with money and effort. To secure the happiness of * children. To develop the new life of the nation. This is what I pray for for the most beloved and greatest children in this year's commemoration of Children's Day.</p>
<h3>Save the Children</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>If it is said that the most pitiful people in the world are the Chinese, then the Chinese children are the most pitiful of the most pitiful. If it is said that half of China's entire population is children, then there may be more than 200 million of the most pitiful of the most pitiful children. But how many people care about the lives of children?</p>
<p>Napoleon, who once conquered a third of the world, also left behind these words about children: "The fate of children is in the hands of their mothers." It is a pity that the mothers in China have never received the treatment of human beings in the world before. Can the little things in the hands of slaves be called free and happy people?</p>
<p>The Western world seems to be more civilized than the East. So the Western children seem to be happier. For example, Busey Dong said: "The first obligation to children is to make them happy." Such famous sayings are readily available. However, the most lacking thing is that Western children have not received a reasonable education. What they inherit is nothing more than the enjoyment and anesthetic life of adults. For example, in the recent survey of young students in the United States on the future world, more than 60% of young people opposed even wars that would strike down villains and maintain justice. The idea of young people's complacency is probably not far from the children's mind. The hope that children have for children in the world of enjoying advanced material civilization should not be too delusional.</p>
<p>At present, China is fighting the anti-Japanese war. Not only adults have received such a full education in this war, but even the toddlers who are learning to speak are full of baptisms from this "from heaven" and believe that all unreasonable treatments and locks can only be achieved by relying on hands and feet. In action, the upsurge of the Chinese people today in welcoming the head-on blow to Japanese imperialism can be liberated.</p>
<p>It is painful that since the Anti-Japanese War, we have not done our duty to protect children to the extent that we should. What have our writers, artists, university professors, rescue teams and propagandists given to the children? Every time, after winning a "considerable price" in the battlefield, there were, however, countless lives and children left behind. The literature and artists and even the university professors probably only gave the children strangeness and fear!</p>
<p>Whenever a town and a town are retreating, the boats and cars are mostly crowded with weak * children. The abandoned ones are also children. What about our compassionate police officers and religious figures?</p>
<p>What about the children in the quiet rear? If the father is an official class, then the children will also enjoy pleasure and debauchery with their fathers; if the father is an ox and horse who is driven and unfree, then his son will be discarded waste. In short, it is abuse.</p>
<p>I don't believe that if all of this generation of children dies, there will be a prosperous next generation, let alone what anti-Japanese war and nation-building are!</p>
<p>Lu Xun's words in the Diary of a Madman, "Save the children," are still powerful calls today. In the great anti-Japanese war to win national independence and freedom. Let us shout out this tragic cry for help again:</p>
<p>Save the children!</p>
<h3>Little Neighbor</h3>
<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>Almost every day it was like this, that voice more charming than anything else, making me unable to help but vaguely open my eyes. Ah! How precise it was! As soon as morning arrived, like a sparrow announcing the evening, it would sing that childish yet moving song.</p>
<p>"My! Home!..."</p>
<p>And so, with a vague feeling, my day would begin.</p>
<p>At first, I was disturbed by this new little neighbor. So, I went downstairs to inquire.</p>
<p>"Hey! Little friend, where is your home?"</p>
<p>He stopped singing, his eyes rolling around.</p>
<p>"On the Songhua River," he said, giggling.</p>
<p>"Really? Do you know where the Songhua River is?" I asked, brushing my teeth while talking to him across the dividing wall.</p>
<p>"No." He looked sad. This sadness seemed to be something he caught from the song.</p>
<p>"Then, are you from Guangzhou?"</p>
<p>"Neither. We came from Xiqiao."</p>
<p>Gradually, we became familiar. It turned out that he and his mother had fled last November, but his father had marched west to De'an before Guangzhou fell. To this day, there is still no news of him. Perhaps he is fighting in some Lushan guerrilla army. And he and his mother settled down in a house on a street called Ranbu (Dyeing Cloth) Street. They lived a homesick life every day, and by the first month of this year, they couldn't hold on any longer. So, they moved in with his aunt. That was my rarely seen neighbor - a middle-aged woman who worked in a wind lantern factory and was also a landlord.</p>
<p>The days passed slowly, and his singing continued in the morning. Another child in the neighborhood taught him. One morning, the two of them sang and laughed strangely. I listened carefully and realized that they had deliberately changed the words "Zhonghua qunxiong" (Chinese Heroes) in the "March of the Volunteers" to "Congcai niurou" (Scallion and Beef). And they sang it particularly excitedly and loudly, until some woman came out and scolded them for being improper, and then they stopped.</p>
<p>Although he was an eleven-year-old child, he knew a lot. After dinner, he often talked to me about his Xiqiao. He said that he was not afraid of Japanese airplane bombs, but he was very afraid of the machine guns that shot down. Once, he was frightened by the bullets that flew like heavy rain on the ground. Speaking of this, he clenched his fist like an adult, unwilling to admit defeat: "We only lose to Japan because of airplanes. If we had as many airplanes as the Japanese, wouldn't we have driven them back long ago?" And then he thought of Xiqiao again, his face shining, because he heard people say that there were many guerrillas there now, and even the bandits who used to rob people were fighting the Japanese. But he was also saddened by the papaya tree he planted, as well as some things and companions he loved.</p>
<p>I often gave him some books and newspapers to read. One day, I pointed to the children's corps there and said,</p>
<p>"Look, they are also fighting the Japanese."</p>
<p>He said with disdain,</p>
<p>"I can do this too."</p>
<p>I remember one day, some friends of mine who were going back to the mainland to serve, brought many elementary school students to my house, saying that they wanted to take a photo in the suburbs. I invited my little neighbor to go with them. In the suburbs, a few friends talked to the children about the children's corps in the mainland, how the children in Shanxi and Shaanxi could shoot guns, and how the children's corps active around Dongjiang promoted to the common people under Japanese planes. These stories greatly agitated the children, and they stubbornly said that they wanted to go back to their hometowns with the teachers to serve. Especially two fourteen-year-old girls, asked the teachers to allow them to join the service corps, making Lao Lin unable to cope. On the way back, my little neighbor was silent all the way. When he reached the stairs, he suddenly said very solemnly: (To be continued)</p>
