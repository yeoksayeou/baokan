<h3 id="c1">日×侵華的新步伐 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日×最近內外的各種政策確已相當紊亂而又矛盾。例如一面同內各階增反對長期戰爭的中氣逼使日×政府有採緩和他們的政策的必長，但另一面則更積極發動對華軍事，擴大戰事。又如在外交方面，一面發動排斥革美法等援華國家的運動，特別是排英運動，但另一方面則又千方百法威脅利誘英美等國出爲調人，以便及早結束中日戰爭。再如一方面向蘇聯屈膝成立了蘇日新漁約，另一方面又於蘇偽邊境向蘇聯啓發戰端，這更不是指示日×對蘇外交方針的紊亂，並且　霧了日×內部的不調和虞對蘇外交意見的衝突。但在這些矛盾與對立當中，却有一個顯明的新動向，據我們的觀察，日×優略者確實自覺疲敝，熱望着早日結京中日戰爭，卽連好戰的軍為也都有這種焦灼的姿態了。</p>
<p>日×優略者以前結束中日日爭的辦法，是盡其全力壓服我抗日政府，但經二十個月的長期蠢動的結果，我抗日政府不但沒被征服』，倒反越打越強，日方雖然一　宣言否認我抗日政府爲中央政府，但是世界各國對我抗日政府的支持，却更加堅决而又積極，最近尤以英國的支援爲　。日本結束戰爭的第一個計劃完全粉碎了。日　結束中日戰爭的第二個步驟，是以重金及優越條件收買漢奸，製造中國內亂及內戰，以收「以華制華」的效果。但是吳佩孚未為日本的陰謀所惑，汪精衞則因上當而爲全體國人所不齒，完全喪失了活動基礎，會仲嗚死後，在或將更加索性一幹，但是他互解的局面已經確定，日×的政治進攻也可說完全失敗了。</p>
<p>日×目前可能的辨法，就是一方面積極推進侵華的軍事行動，完成其所謂『板垣停戰綫』，另一方面威脅利誘第三國出頭調停，前日重慶中央社所傳外訊，稱；日×政府又議决對我政治陰謀若千條，電令其在華軍事首領切實執行。其中有二要點，（一）儘量封鎖英美法各國在華的權益，並設法　迫利誘，使英美法出任綱人，（二）極力　傳反共侵蘇，爲欺騙世人，欺騙我國之烟幕，這些消息確其相當的確實性，亞目是和，軍行動配合着，景近×軍佔領了南昌之後更積極向西推進，微聞彼輩妄想於四月十五日以前佔領長沙，又据某方傳說，×軍最近在華中增加一師團，華北增加×師團，華南增加×師團，其對華的軍事行動，確實相當急進，他的目的要在穿成打通粵漢路，聯結北自西安，經畏沙，南至北海的『扳垣停戰綫』，以準備暫時結束，中×戰爭，作他長期建設的好夢（？）</p>
<p>但另一方面則又須有力的第三國出頭調停。所以，雖因英借鉅額積極支持中國抗戰強靭力量的法幣而發動仇英及排英運動，但對於英國始終是抱着熱烈的期待，希望英國仍可出頭調停中×戰爭。排英運動雖然已由日×國擴六至中國淪陷區，但其中依然包含着瀘厚的期待，日×既須討好英國，乃至法美，自然要表示他反社會主義國家的醜態。於是，方面在蘇偽邊境輕啓戰端，一方面又擴大反共侵蘇煙慕。這都日×是一貫的作風。</p>
<p>我們對於日×侵略者的連一新步伐，爲依然是一種空想。「板垣停止綫」並不能如所希望容易實現，卽令增加軍隊幾個師團，依然是無效的，因爲我軍各綫確已整備完畢，正欲開始反攻，×軍防備我軍的反攻，已感困難　全綫的進展更是夢想。第一方面，駐日及駐華兩英使，及駐華法國大使，雖曾集歲於滬上，但所談論的問題，當不外乎如何維護他們在華的權益。及如何應付遠東侵略者的計劃。我們全國人民都是這樣期待，我們也是這樣觀察，事情的發展，當不出我們的預料吧！日×急燥的「狼奔豕突』，將更加深他的泥足罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">資本主義國家的危機失業工人 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 波拉哥夫作　吳克堅譯</p>
<p>資本主義的世界，處在新的經濟危機中，已經一年多了，資本主義國家的工人階級，還沒有從一九二九年所開始的世界經濟危機年代嚴重的痛中恢復過來，面且重新將經濟危機所有的重担放在工人階級的肩上：失業工人的加多，工資的縮減，飢餓與貧困。</p>
<p>新的經濟危機最重要的特點，就在於它是從爲車分世界而已經開始的第二次帝國主義戰爭條件下口發士的。在這個戰爭裏，已經捲入了人類的一大部份人口。</p>
<p>機與戰爭使工人階級貧困化的過程，更加尖銳化了，由於危機與戰爭的結果，在日本和德國小手工業者的破產，達到了特別大的範圍。自然，這一點會引起隱蔽的失業工人極大的發展，其範圍是無可限量的。</p>
<p>當第一次帝國之義大戰的時候，列寧曾寫道：「在資本主義國家是這樣來『調聖經濟生活』卽是對工人（部份的農民也在內）造成軍事的苦役，而對銀行家和資本家則造成天堂。他們這種調濟，是在於把工人「引導』到飢餓的境地；而對銀行家和資本家，却保障了（秘密地和反動官僚式的）比戰前更高的利　。』（列寧全集二十二卷一六七頁）列寧這一估計的正確性，在目前是良明顯的可以看出來。在近年來，在資本主義國家，特別是在德國，日本意大利，正就是樣來「調濟　濟生活」的。</p>
<p>當在美團，英國，注國和其他　家喪開始新的經濟危機時候，就已經有很大數量的失業工人。例如在美國，一九二七年夏天，按照最低限度計算，就有八百萬失業工人，英國是一百五十萬。在一九二九年危機開始以後，在這設國家裏經濟行情比較好的月份時候，也是這樣的情形，這　經是一種最低限度，低於這種限度的失業工人數量還沒有達到。</p>
<p>在近的經濟危機第一年，失業工人的增　，比較一九二九年的經濟恐慌第一年，是要快得多，例如，在美國　近一年中，失業工人增加了三百萬人，而在現在這個時候，失業工人總戴，按照，國勞動同盟統計，就有一千一百萬人</p>
<p>關於在資本中義國家失業工人的範圍，我們可以按照國際聯盟每月紀事報告　下列的統計來計算，在等國　五個工人和職員裏面，就有一個失業工人。（一年以前是十個人人中一個失業工人）牟英國是每七個工人中一個失業工人，在利時每四個工人中，總有一個完全或半失業的工人，在我爾蘭，每四個工人中一個失業工人，在加拿大每八個工人中一個失　工人。在美國失業工人的情景，僅僅在採掘工業裏　，在危機開時，就縮减了兩百萬工人，卽是等於緒减百分之二十五的工人。這樣，就是說每四個了人中，就有一個在一年前是有工作的，而現在却被排擠到街上了。而那些留在企業裏的工人，在每星期裏也僅僅祇作幾天的工作，這就說明這樣一種事實，就是從危機開始的時候，工資已經减低了百分之三十六，而同時在工人的數量也縮滅了百分之二十五。</p>
<p>在重工業裏，失業工人更加嚴重，在鋼，煤，汽車量重要的中心工業裏，已經有分之一以上的工人是失業了。</p>
<p>英國工人階級的狀况，也不會好多少，最近八年來，按照勞動部的計，有保險的工人和職員中，每六個工人中有一個失業者，新的危機開始以前，失業工人曾有些減少，可是到一九三七年底新的危機開始時，又重新增加了。在一九三八年比一九一七年失業工人增加了四十萬人。而在現在，失業工人又趕到了兩百萬人。例如在棉織工業島，每三個工人中就有一個失業者，造船業每四個工要中有一個失業者。煤礦、每五個工人中有一個失業者，建築業每：個工人中有一個失業者，這些情形是發生在英國最重要的部門裏。</p>
<p>無疑的，軍備的增長，使許多工業部門　，特別是機噐製造業和造船等業部門裏的工人，失業的發展是延緩了。可是甚　在這襄　需　貨的增加還不能補償商業定貨猛烈的縮減。在這些部門喪失業工人增　　。例如就是完成大量軍事定貨的造船工業，有百分之五十的造船所停工了。</p>
<p>上述情形對棉織業和謀　的範園便更大了。蓋開是—業的中心—在臨時改善狀况的幾年之後，重新又開始了極嚴重危機的時期。僅在最近一年中有十二萬織工失掉了工作。政府和資本家企　用滬滅棉業『多餘』的設備來改善它的狀况。僅在最近兩年中會消減了四百萬以上的紡錘—四十個大工廠的設備。然而狀况並未因此而改善。</p>
<p>在最近一年中法國失業工人同樣的增加了。據一九三八年，十一月官場的統計，登記了的失業工人爲四十萬一千人，而一九三七年十一月爲三十六萬二千人。部份的失業工人一九三七年九月爲百分之七點五，到一九三八年九月時增加到百分之十八點三了，</p>
<p>近幾月來日本失業工人猛烈地增加了。失業工人的增加，不僅由於手工業者和農民的破產，而且也出於　業工人的失業。在工業的許多部門中，由於原料的缺乏，縮小了生產。近來關閉了的下僅有幾千的企業，而且有許多大工廠作坊。據日本資產階級報紙的統計，在日本目前有一百八十萬失業工人。此外，有三百萬人是在一星期內僅作幾天工作的。</p>
<p>德國法西斯的報紙。喜歡散佈關於細滅在勞動交易所已經登記的失業工人數量，然而報紙勞　交易所在目前實際上，已經變成了動員失業者去作實事强迫工作的機關，却緘默不談，幾上萬失業工人，被勞動交易所在强迫的方式下，派遣去作軍　建築和戰略道路的建築。實際上在德國有着幾百萬的失業工人。</p>
<p>在目前資本主義世界，危機和戰爭給工人階級和勞動羣衆以新的和更嚴重的　困。在蘇聯　會主義制度，更加笨固勞　羣衆的幸福，年復一年的發展。在社會主義的國家裏，失業工人的現欲是永遠消滅了。</p>
<p>弁第二個斯達林的五年計劃中，蘇聯的工人和職員的數量增加了百分之十七點六。中等年度的工資。增加了百分之一百一十三點五。而工資的基金，增加了白分之一百五十。</p>
<p>第三個五年計劃，已經指示出工人和職員新的數量，發展爲百分之十七，工資中增長爲百分之二十五。工資的基金爲百分之六十五，勞動羣衆的消費，應當增加一倍半以上。</p>
<p>在資本主義內國家　，是每况愈下，貧困，飢餓和失業，在社會主義國家裏，勞動羣衆的幸福，文化和富裕的生活，是不斷的　展。（譯自眞理報）林家躍夏傑常鄭之煥</p>
<p>香港學生，在過去被一般人認爲是</p>
<h3 id="c3">香港青年學生的當前任務 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 林家　夏傑常　鄭之煥</p>
<p>【公子哥兒】·【皇家子弟】甚至【白面書生」，但自開動以來，由於香港學生的　覺，不斷的爲國　勞，勗勉苦幹，已學成爲「靑年戰士」了。</p>
<p>這期　的轉變，固然是×帝國主義的殘酷侵略與新中國歸史底的影響，然而中國學生運動的波濤，已欣起書港學生運動的澎湃，也是不可否忍的。</p>
<p>正因爲抗×的民埃戰爭　中國靑年運動的急激開展，香港擊生抗戰期間已表現着雄厚而偉大的力量：如全港學生畢　—學生賑會　建立，全港學生献捐賑，的熱烈，全港學生四國服務及從軍運動的踴躍，其他如遺派代表。席中國學生聯合會，及全世界年大會，取得組反同　的合任，與世界青年的贊助，在在顯示本港的功動，雖然在另一方面上，庚汛的學生仍未動員起來，　　工作仍未切　開展，自我教育的缺乏。忽視學生本身利益的爭取在在顯示着本港學生的工作沒有充分發展，然而這缺點，我們認爲　不足影響整個學生運動的向前，反而在策勵本港學生更進一步。爲祖國的自由，平等幸福而奪鬥！因此我們對於華南學生的支柱，海外靑年主（力）本港學生，除特別關　與垂注外，並致與熱烈的明望切實執行下列工作，修使　中華民挨解放運動，在中國靑年學生積　與然烈的支撑着，發揚光大！第一鞏固學賑充，學賑，本港學生保壘學賑會，乃全港學生確一的機構，他的組　成份，是由全港大中小學三百餘校。在過去到現在，曾不斷的寫下了香港學運新的歷史，就以中國與華南學運而論，也曾盡了極大的作用。由於學　　構的宏偉，組織的嚴眾。作的優越，本港學生對於這富有歷史義意的保壘—賑會，　應積橄的鞏固他，充實他，至於如何去築固和充實，在這裏我特別的提供出來：（一）凡本港學生一律要明白學賑　的工作，了解學賑會工作，參加學賑會工作，（二）要担負向各師長和同學宜傳，應如何支持賬，及充實學賑，而對學賑所有發動的工作，加以切　推　與執行，（三）帮助區委會，段姿會，及校內工作等。第二加緊賬濟工作，×人的侵略，×人的殘我，使，華兒女，流　失所，無家可歸，其悽慘之情，實不可以筆墨形容於萬一，故經濟工作應當加緊執行，雖然在過去賑濟工作，本港學生曾盡了很大的實任，如節食運動，買物運動，及募捐運　等，惟以數目而論，仍寥寥可數。（學賑會一年多多的籌欵，仍　超過　傷元）　環顧四週，則　鴻遍野，觸目萬心，因此今後更希望本港學止，踴躍捐輸，尤望本港畢生對家長親友方面，各方獻　，使他們在有錢出錢有力出力的原則下，努力賑濟，慷慨捐輸。第三，強化國際宣傳，香港是國際人士的總匯，也是祖國對外官傳重要的樞組，在從前、港學生對國際宣傳下作，並不忽視，如　賑會第一屆第二屆通過的　案中，加强國際　傳工作，佔着主要的地位。可惜執行不力，未能發生偉大影響，今後對全世界靑年團體。及國際民侵略運動會的聯系，用文字圖片，影片的交換與展費，積極調　與推動，使國際宣傳强化，其他如個人，面，由於本港學生英文程度的良好，更　隨時隨地進行個別　備工作，務使國際人士，加緊援動，第四，切　執行反奸工作，抗戰愈深入與持久，則一般動搖妥協份子的活動便愈猖獗，因此反奸工作的執行要急意漢奸活動并予以打擊，第五，爭取學生界本身利益，在過去，一般青年學生運，對動于靑年事生本身和養的爭取與改進，缺乏注意，這是嚴重的缺點，今後我們對于民埃解放運動，與學，解放運動，實切聯黎起來外，而對於學界本身利益的爭取，應當積極執行，但學生利益的爭取，是需要學生界的團結何紮實，因此，如何團給全港學生，如與加強學生的統一作與陣綫，已成爲先决問題了。爲『學生利益』『靑年解放』起見。更望本港學生團結起來，共同奮鬥，加强自我教育，在抗戰中自我數育工作，爲今迫切需要，因爲只有明白祖國的抗戰情勢，國際形勢及客觀環境與主觀力量，其他如持久戰，民族統一陣綫導問題，才能增加智識，豐富條養，故對自我教育的加强，成爲目前主要的天，我們學生的本身，爲　自己的前途，為着自己的學識，加强理論的修養，武裝自已的頭　，是迫切需要的啊！第七，展開核內工作，舉生會的建立，在本港一般學校中，除規　較大的外，餘的仍未成立，就以成立的而海，工的展開與動員同學，仍未有具體，以致，部份同學的主活與抗學今後爲加强學生界的救亡工作，—教師，當年，學生携手起來，深入校內，展開校內的一切工作，使每一個同學生活與抗戰聯系起來！第八，聯系各校教師團結各階　靑年是萬分的需要在去一般學校對於師生間的　膜存着</p>

<p>鎮海居中民　自動遷離</p>
<p>鎮海方面，自×艦砲戰停止後，情况頗爲安謐，惟居民自動遷移者甚多，據悉，全城戶口，不足八百戶，店舖開市者。僅及半數，鎮　黨政軍界於三月廿六日上午，在鎮海　警局召開保衛大鎮海會講，提案中有對鎖大　江（卽甬江口）一案，因　係行旅及貨運，未予通過，前次滬上所傳鎮海缺口對鎖　　　以此可證明為謠言無　又備為　要時堵塞　海對鎖綫缺口之老太平　。現仍泊　海生　迤東之招商碼頭，並木移動，滬定航綫復告停頓後，　甬定間航輪仍照常，有利實輸往來行駛，故由滬赴定客貨。仍　由甬　道，石浦　岸，當局雖已禁　航輸停　，惟為疏通客貨運，　準利賣　於每星期六，　　一次。絕對禁止其他航輪停霧，滬臺　綫各輪，暫不擬派輪行駛。秒，由副指揮汪鶴松先率　干有力支隊，向蘇嘉路乘機挺進，至總指揮朱希。於天　山會　後，已向消浙省府主席黃紹雄請示機宜，不日可率師　開，與止規軍配備呼應，發動廣泛之游擊戰，完成威　　制之任務，浙西風　，又將突緊張。</p>

<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>這種又毅的答覆，决不單是口頭上的同意，而已確確實實地表之於行動了，我們看，每一个中國人的政黨都在同一的口號卜發動民衆，組織民衆，以配合中央政府和軍事的當局要求。</p>
<p>中國人民對於汪精衞事件的堅决態度，誠使一般在中國的外國觀察者驚奇。當汪精衝突然離　重慶血跑到香港去的時候，正是陽曆元且。那天晚上，在重際國際俱樂部裏的許多外國人對於這　事情　切切私語，以爲中國有可能再度分製而釀成不可收拾的局面，以至　中央政府明國民黨的本身都要起極大的擾動。當汪精衞把要求接受近衞和平條件的電報送給委員長的時候，許多外國的政治觀察者部還以爲蔣注這次的不和，將是中圃人民意識中所眞正要走的路的最後决定。幾天之後，中央政府和國民寫執行委員會發表了對於汪精衛叛國的嚴勵處置，這給了外國興論界一個　大的驚駭。</p>
<p>開除在精衛黨藉和革除一切職權的事實，不單表示了中國國民黨對於抗戰的態度。　時，　表揚了全國人民與論的一致致要求。故開除汪精衛黨藉這　　已不獨是國民黨中央執行委員　的决議，實乃是全國人民內心的决定。這現象表示着全國一政的團結，和民族精神高度的發揮。這種億大的精神不單可以給外來的敵人日本帝國主義以致命的打擊，並且還可使一切游移不定態度兩可的內奸們從此不敢拾頭。</p>
<p>最後，我們來到桂林，在此地我們住了兩個星期「這短短的時間中，使我們深切地了解，不單是軍人，政黨，政府……集中一切力量從事於抗戰，就是所有的人民都在要求抗戰，竭力支待抗戰。我親眼看見日本人殘暴地轟炸着這小縣，平均五家中被毀了一家，卽是我自己所住的地方也遭受了兩次轟炸。在這兩次轟炸經厯中，我看到所有的市民在警報聲中，携幼抉老敏捷而無恐懽地步入了防空壕，站在桂林這種堅固而自然的防空洞內，我還親眼看到許多學生和教授們衣然華了書本向市民講釋關於軍事，防空，教亡……等應有的常識和技術。所以，警報的時候，街道上除子持槍的軍醫在巡邏　之　，絕對看不見一個來柱的平民。可是，當警報解除後不到成分鐘，街道上伊恢復了正常的朴態。有一次，當警報解除之後，我與桂林的公安局長，和省政府的幾個朋友，同去視察火車站被炸的情形，日本飛機在車站旁邊一共投下了十二個炸彈，所得的效果，非　沒有炸毀路軌，就是運車站的　子也未有絲毫的損傷。我們汽車抵達車站，正是警報解除後的十五分鐘，而一切被炸彈損傷的地方，都已被工人修理完整了。這種突擊的工作精神眞使我感到興奮，　嘆，和佩服！</p>
<p>李蒙講得非常起勁，手舞足蹈地似乎在大庭廣衆之前演講，額前略　透露　汗氣。李　太太　過一條手帕，她說一可惜得很，你這段長　精　的演講，卻祇有兩個聽衆，好；我來替你做結束吧！日本人企圖以癲在的轟炸來動搖後方民衆抗戰的意志，不過，我相信，日本飛機愈轟　得兇，更足以增進中國人民的仇恨心，抗戰到底的意志。也就格外　定了」！我點頭同意她的結論。這時候已是上點，了，窗外是添黑底片，天空中閃着顆稀星。大家都不點倦意，在互道着「晚安」聲中入眠。</p>

<p>【本報特約通訊】汕頭市在今日，他的重要性、是任誰不能否認的、尤其是當廣東戰事進展到目前的階段、華南甚而至整個中國、汕頭司算是唯一能與外間直接發生關係的地方、所有贛粵閩各處所需要的供給、目前都集中於汕頭，因此可以說、汕頭在今日的地位、是集廣州　門和其他許多能够吸收外間接濟的口岸於一身、其重要性可以想見、</p>
<p>近幾天來、汕頭緊張的消息　登各報、大概×人對於這個唯一的吐訊港是練不會放過了、汕頭是沿海之區、防禦雖然比較困難、但是軍隊、政府、人民那有守土的决心、而且在汕　口外遍布水雷、×人要進犯，想也不是件易事、訊者這次由港來汕、事先　得汕頭緊張的消息、幻想着汕頭的情形　相當恐怖、可是抵達汕頭後所見到的、一切出乎幻想之外、在市面不但毫不見到一點緊張的特徵、却是到處表現着沉着的感覺、我想、大概緊張的消息是謠言能？却又不然、一位同業告訴我、汕頭市政府已經命令市民、由四月四日起實行强迫疏散、凡　婦都　在疏散之列、並目目前確有不少×艦在窺伺着汕頭、不是謠言、不過汕頭的人民緊張慣了、到了緊張的時候、依然一樣、冉沒有什麼　異的感覺、</p>
<p>汕頭的市民、原本有二十萬多、有一個時期、因爲×機的瘋狂轟炸、風聲鶴唳、曾滅至三萬名、近來又是漸漸恢復　觀了，市民增到十四萬之多、一切的商店都大部恢復、市面開業的商戶、大概有百份之九十以上、晚上、燈火輝煌、電虹管廣告招牌、在樓　發亮、雖然不是昇平景象、却可見得汕頭的繁榮、并不因緊張空氣而受打擊、在不聞炮聲之前、一直維持着他的原歌。</p>
<p>汕頭給我的印象、我覺得他有點像廣州、齊整的市道、樸素的樓房，沒有一點不傷、令日廣州不幸失陷了、汕頭的地位也　　　加重、對此我們也不能再忽視了、在汕頭的馬路上、每一處要衝都建有壕塹、這是準備着巷戰的防禦工事、萬一戰事在汕頭爆發了、每一座樓房　　了一個碉　、索取×人的股大代　、每一間樓　都要報、再不會像廣州那麼輕而易取，</p>
<p>抗戰的情緒充滿了整個汕頭、我在中山公園看見了張在亭子里的漫盡、是聲討主和的汪逆的、在街上看見了許多抗戰標語、每一個穿着革絲色　服的小學生、彷彿是一個小戰士、他們正鍛練着，準備爲國家的自的而鬥爭、還有、那一羣一羣的步伐整齊的壯丁隊伍、大踏步、高唱歌、這是民衆武力的表現、同時也　抗戰意織的堅定底表現、我問過許多住在汕頭的人、如果汕頭有事、你將怎樣、我得到同一的答復、只有戰、怎麼呢、因爲汕頭如果有戰事、完全沒有撤退的餘地的、所以、如果要生存　只有戰。</p>
<p>汕頭現在成爲交通的要　，同時廣東省的政府和許多重要的機關都設在曲江、因此汕頭和曲江也就發生了很密切的關係、從汕頭到潮安從朝安到曲江、客貨運　非常擁情、潮韶公路的客票、一個月之先的都已　光、要趁一次車並不是易串、因爲這個關係，汕頭和潮安的旅業都特別發達、每一家旅店都件滿、候車的客人、</p>

<p>— 忠勇</p>
<p>【榆林通訊】粗　西北，高原上，—林，在國防綫上佔着險要的地位，它沿着占老巍峨的長城，居于邊睡的沙漢中。氣侯嚴寒。地多不毛，夙稱僻壤。</p>
<p>稽考過去的歷史，它是國防上九九邊之一的重鎭，榆林自秦時開爲上郡，，至漢時已被匈奴征服，經魏晉北朝，皆在淪陷外族　鐵蹄卜過生活，直至隋唐始見勝州之名，唐未至未元兩，隸西夏，明人欲復河套，　徒　于此，駐兵滇堡，建署築城，因之人口日多，文物也隨之建樹。</p>
<p>淸代咸同年間，回民和「捻匪」的兩次北竄陜北，各縣均受援亂，破壞，獨有榆林以軍民　合，防守得宜，未經攻破，人民得以安全。</p>
<p>明末李日成亂榆，攻人城門，全市婦童，用磚石與之巷戰，將其擊退。</p>
<p>民國以來，盧占奎，川山甲等巨匪，屢次攻城，人民臨時武裝，持大刀斧頭，出城迎匪，有些做了壯烈的犧牲，而匪業終被擊潰。</p>
<p>數百年間，林也經過不少的災難，但它是有充分的力量去克服困難的，這一部血的歷史，更證明了檢林的民衆，在賢明的頒袖領導之下，是　够盡着它在國防上的艱　任務的。</p>
<p>溝橋侵略的炮火，驚醒了全國的廣大民衆，也驚醒了榆林。</p>
<p>神聖的抗戰初期階段×人攻陷了綏包，太原，因而綏蒙戰事頓形緊。張榆林緊接着前方，北鄰內蒙，東接神府，南控綏延，西通寧夏，將來北戰場激戰展開，馬上就　成了前方，它在軍事上的險要，已不容我們漠視。</p>
<p>鄧××將軍，去　坐　榆林，除襄助蒙政，解决了內蒙最嚴車的糾紛，堅定，內家各旗抗戰的决心外，並指揮地方駐軍××師高××部，在府谷保德東勝一帶作戰，屢建奇功，給××進犯大西北的企圖以頭痛擊，是值得我們敏　和　揚的。</p>
<p>×機近在陜北大肆轟炸，以動搖人心，府谷東勝一帶防地，屢遭空襲，東勝×入軍曾用步槍擊落×機二架，可知　們勇敢機牲的戰鬥精神了</p>
<p>榆林軍民是昨够密切台作的，軍隊帮助老百姓，時有所聞，一般民衆對愛國工作，均能踴躍參加，獻金捐欵等，更能慷慨解囊，如鐵匠劉戰垂毀家紓難，小學生節食獻金。</p>
<p>最近又響應　　運動，全市各業，均已舉行，武裝動員，也有自賞軍馬的，自購槍械及自備給養的。騎兵　擊隊，義勇壯丁隊，少年先鋒隊，壯丁常備隊等的組織和訓練，　健全有力，婦女兒童，也在組訓中。</p>
<p>這些健兒，都準備在西北戰塲上，各顯　手，殲減×人，粉碎×人在西化的　　，完　我　保衛西北的偉大任務。（民革社）</p>
<h3 id="c17">延安印象 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 美聯社記者馬田著　楊譯</p>
<p>延安以以數哩之外，便是前線，但這個城市和附近一帶，却平靜無事，和日軍未侵入山西以前，並無一致。陜晉兩省，有黃河爲界，這條滔滔臣流，至今仍像一道日軍不能　過的欄柵。</p>
<p>倘若把此地日夜訓練的新兵和正規軍隊，移到別的地方去，或者不再舉行大規模的民衆集會，再去掉了絡繹于途的運軍火的貨車，那麼，一個偶然到此遊電的人，必會相信這個地方，是未被戰爭蹂躪過的一槐乾淨土，可是囘頭一看那被炸得瘉痍滿目的城鎭，先前的感覺，便卽煙消雲散了。</p>
<p>這裏不論農人，商人，和工人，都樂意受共產黨人的統治。這特區中的土地，已分配給人民，大地主間自已被淸除，農人的債務，已被豁免，租稅可延期繳付，……這種種，都使這荒焦貧瘠的區域，得到意外的繁榮，人民心滿意足。</p>
<p>中國的商人。尤其是經營運輪及旅店的，都說戰爭帶來了意外的繁榮。有一個率直滿足的車商，他有四五架馬車，曾經對我說，他的生意比去年多三倍，而且車租價錢日漸增加，使他獲得大利，增加其馬車數量至一倍。一位旅店老板聽到我們的談話，亦說他的生意一樣加多。沿西安至陝西省東北部的公路上的旅店行家，也都說生意興盛。</p>
<p>此間生活費已增高，但據中國人民稱，其增高程度沒有別的地方那麼顯著。食糧的價格去年增加五成至一倍，而華西各地則高至三倍至四倍，此地受共產黨統治多年，加以地方具常償　，在經濟上，居民早已能自給自足。對外間僅有小小的商業而已，這種天賦經濟的結果，居民都不曾感受到戰爭的痛苦。</p>
<p>此地主要爲農業區域，農民們都能生產自已所需的東西。特區南部附近種有很多棉花，北部牧塲有許多羊，能產羊毛。雖然有許多手工業的工廠出產布疋，但大部份的紡織都是自己家製的。木材不多，幾乎僅用以建築岩洞和泥屋。主要的燃料爲木炭，點燈則用自製的蠟燭和菜油。</p>
<p>特區政府爲便利買賣起見，曾發行錢票，代督各種國幣和省幣，甚至銅板亦以錢票代替。這種錢票除了特區政府的信用外，毫無現金做準備，但特區中人人都能照值使用。國幣的需求並不大，而特區貨幣在特區以外各地亦不通行</p>
<p>奢侈品的價格，因日貨從翼察熱習各地潛入，並不昂貴，香煙算是最貴的東西，因爲須由南方輸入。共產黨人常常向農民宣傳，謂自外運來的香煙，均被日本人下了　。因此，最流行的『×××』牌子，實際上已受鉀斥，而代以價錢較廉和裝　較差的牌子，就是濟些牌子的香煙，售價亦比外面貴二三倍。</p>
<p>中國的居民對城說，這裏尙有許多以物易物的交易，但多屬農民互相交換過　的產物，而非農民與商人的買賣。</p>
<p>特區中最顯著的特點便是絕無盜賊，人民亦亦無寒酸之相，乞丐絕跡，乞丐行爲，已不容于特區中，所有叫化子均逃往南方，或由特區政府結以工作了。大部份盜　都改邪歸正，向八路軍投誠，特區人民以前生年與中央軍作戰，最近二上個月中，又與日軍抗戰，因此每一個人部受到一些軍事訓練。此閒　不到搶刦的故事，而在不遠的南方，西安的附近，則可稱家常使飯了。</p>
<p>特區政府極力解救農民相其他居民之痛苦，結果，人民對之甚爲愛護，此種使護政府的感情是在中國別的地方所找不到的，在其他的某些地方，農民因爲地方政府的强徵暴飮，不是懼怕政府，便憎恨政府。</p>
<p>倘若這裏有一個晨民歉收了一年，政府　帮助他，他的兒子被送往學校，由政府供養，特區政府又設有贈　處。這裏的農民　愛護及信賴兵士，這是中國歷史上所未有，他們稱軍隊做「我們的軍隊」，而非「那些軍隊」。士兵們被訓練過如何對　農民的。他們購買東西，均付代價，並時與居民結交。</p>
<p>我在延安會參觀過一個展覽會，那是特區政府特爲農民而　設的，彷彿像美國的「村　展覽會」一樣。那裏展覽一些最佳種的家畜和馬匹，並評判其優劣，各式種子，水菓，蔬菜，都陳列出來。並派有經　的人在場中講述　植，灌溉，和耕作的新方法。又陳列着紡織和皮革的特。出品，並講述製造　法。這一切都是政、爲農民而　計的、每日赴會，觀的農民成千成萬，特區展覽會簡直放了一星期假、</p>
<p>在政冶上言，這特區也　是全中國最進步的地方。不但人民在特區會議中，有其選舉之議做代表。卽一縣議會或一村　會亦由彼等以民選法操　之。特區萬的人民都說『我們的政府』，而不說「那政府」。區內並無負包車夫和轎夫，挑行李的舌力亦甚少。農民們對于政府官員，甚主「中國列寧」的毛澤東，亦不會見　迴避，且農民亦隨時願供奔走。所有政府職員都穿着同樣棧素的藍色棉布制服，所食的亦不曾比農民的好，所住的也不如一個中等商人。這種種事實都是使人民愛截特區政府的原因。</p>
<p>日本常常宣言此次侵略中國乃爲　除共產主義在遠東的威脅血戰、共產黨人却反能利用日人的騙詞而向農民宣　。記　曾到延安外四十哩　小村，參加一個茶話會，記者曾以　詢諸各農民。該茶　會的領袖是一個滿面風　，而有　　的農民，他說：</p>
<p>一　日本人，夠見到共產黨為我們所做的政　、他們必不願打我們了。我們已很安業，因爲共產黨帮助了我們。日本的統治者　　像我們則領袖那樣好，日本人當必好得多、但　們不是想　定共產主義，他們熱要的是中國，一</p>
<p>日本的宣傳就是西洋所講「自作自發受」的宣傳。（四月一日）</p>

<p>本港機造業，年來版爲發達，出品銷路向爲英屬各國，原料則向多採甩×國棉紗。但是目前過到兩大危機，第一在銷路方面，因英　實施重訂特惠稅則及棉織人造絲品稅則、本年本港棉布運銷英總各地者，數量大爲减少。第二是原料問題，抗戰以來，國人廠家，×××××，紛紛改用孟買棉紗。但近來該業繫興，孟買棉紗供過於求，價格日增。國產棉紗，自上海淪陷後，來源卽告斷絕；於是，國棉紗入口數量乃又激增。</p>
<p>前一問題，影響不僅及於織造業者，而且還有數十工人的失的問題。事實上抗戰以來、我國戰士被服及藥用棉布需要突　，今後亦必繼續增加，如果該業能够盡其心力，爲祖國爲民挨的前途打算，似應立卽考慮發展國內的織造業去，其次是爲祖國當前的需要而生產。但這裏便要產涉到原料問題。其實我國西南各省，頗多適宜植棉之地，而最近國際情勢益利於我，中英中法密切合作，則在西南設廠紡紗、亦有極大便利。以上所述，雖似緩不濟急，但確爲根本之圖，我們一面希望愛國廠商加以深思、更盼行將參加生產會議的諸君，有所計劃。</p>
<p>此外，織造專門人才，本港本屬不少，戰區流亡各地者允多，當此國家需人孔亟之際，政府關係機關，對此應有適要的辦法，俾能爲國効力。而　種人才，亦應以爲國奮鬥自勵，設法回國投動。</p>

<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>一篇為全體聽眾熱烈讚同的演詞</p>
<p>林樞將軍是一位英勇的現役軍人。當十九路軍抗日的時候，他已經就是一員健將了。抗戰烽火瀑發之後，輾轉百戰於第五戰區，出生入死於槍林彈雨之中，功動尤著。嗣因帶花受傷，囘桂治療，稍愈，即任廣西學生軍第一團團長，負責訓練學生軍的任務，近奉當局之命，隨同中國救亡劇團出國宣慰僑胞，抵港時備受此間各團體之熱烈歡迎，各情經誌前報。昨天，在本港愛國僑胞的歡迎會上，他駁斥汪精衞的「舉一個例一，尤爲中肯精闢，全塲緊緊擁擠着的觀衆，都熱烈鼓掌讚同，譽爲新中國的眾人的靈魂，是替不願做亡國奴的中華民族子孫所要說的話。會畢，很多朋友紛紛可囑記者將林先生的演詞發表出來，藉以加深一般「近視」同胞的認識，而不爲×人漢奸的陰視偽計所迷惑。記者於此，謹將林先生　演詞，爲吾親愛的僑胞報道如次。首先林先生說：</p>
<p>今天本來想和諸同志講一點關於軍事方面的問題。但是因爲連日見到汪精衛在××日報上發表的幾篇論文，壓理不住我軍人的情感上的激動，所以在此先談一談汪的『舉一個例』，舉幾點來加以質問，看看汪的主張荒唐釗怎樣的田地。</p>
<p>第一　汪精衛在那篇文章里，劈頭就哀悼曾仲嗚之死，說曾之死是爲國事而死，當他彌留之際，猶說國事有汪先生，家事有吾妻，我沒有甚麼不放心的。好像曾到臨死還以國事爲念；但我試問：曾的死果眞是爲國事而死嗎？抗戰以來，數十萬英勇將士，爲了要完成保衞國家的任務，曾經什任何艱苦環境之下，英勇地奮鬥，作了壯烈的犧牲，數百萬同胞，更因受了××的蹂躪摧殘，流離死亡；這些視死如歸忍痛犧牲的精神和事蹟，汪難道竟一無所見嗎？而曾仲鳴身受國家優　的裁培，不思在這國步艱　之際，盡力報　中樞，竟逃到外國去居住，××××××××××××××××××××××××，而汪猶厚顏說他是爲國　而死，則試問這千百萬的將士和民衆，其機牲爲何？又是爲了什麼而死？所以注的話應該改爲「曾仲鳴爲××國事而死』！曾仲鳴的話應該，吾　』，才符合事實。</p>
<p>一陣痛恨××的笑聲衝破嚴　的空氣。之後、全體又靜靜地聽林先生說：</p>
<p>第二　汪說：自從我發表了艷電以後，國人都目主和，是我的主張了，其實主和之議，是經過最高機關共同討論而决定的。於是他舉出二十六年十二月六日在漢口中央銀行開的國防最高會議的紀錄來做一個例，但仔細一看，該會的主席是汪精衞，而秘書仟恰是曾仲鳴，這由他們一手包辦做成的文件，現在又由任發表出來，里面就有不少可疑的地方。且任精衞的例如果是眞的詁，那麼也不過是汪目已做主席曾担任筆記的欺騙同志向×人屈膝的自白而已。該文中又說到委員長和德大使陶德曼　面時，曾說：『在戰事如此緊急中，無法調停進行談判，希望德國通知日本，先行停戰』，這是委員長對第三國使者的談話，也深切可以看出委員長表明在××沒有退出中國國土之前不容有和平談判的堅决抗戰的决心。以如此堅决的表示，汪竟說「主和」是共同討論决定主張，這是從何說起？這就是汪的自相矛盾，打自己嘴巴。且陶德曼到京見</p>
<p>委員長時，汪曰認曾先由他向委員長　述，試問『主和』既是要經過　高機關共同討論的，又何必勞汪這樣急燥，又何以凡主和的事，總有汪緾繞在裏面，這是什麼血緣？</p>
<p>汪又說，他不離開重慶。就無從發表艷電，這更荒唐之至了。豈有在自己的國土里，竟不能發衣經過最高機關共同討論决定的主張的道理？且汪說『主和證据　止千百」，照他說來，中央是大有主和的人了，那麼　既有這許多同志，儘可在國內共同討論，又何苦要逃到國外來，胡說八道呢？而曾仲鳴到臨死的時候，也只把主和的責任，托孤在汗精衛一個人的身上呢？何以汪精衞目已說：『對國事尙有主張相同的我』，而不提到尙有中央別一個人呢？—杯先生越講越憤激，聽者亦越聽越感動。</p>
<p>第三　汪是同意沂衞的聲明，認爲可以做爲談判的基礎的，現在就來檢討一下沂衞聲明的內容吧！近衞所說的大概可分爲四點：（一）對中國無領土之要求，並尊重中國主權；（二）中日滿結合，經濟提携；（三）共同防共，內蒙駐兵；（四）中國內地，允許日本駐兵并自由雜居。試問這些是不是亡國的條件呢？既然沒有領土的對心了，何以把中日滿台稱？難道東北四省不是中國的領士嗎？汪精衛也竟同意了嗎？既然尊重中國主權了，何以又能在內地駐兵？這還不算是破壞中國行政主權的統一嗎？汪精衛也竟然承認了嗎？旣然駐兵內蒙了，何以汪精衛的艷電還說不會影嚮到中蘇邦交？這是把中國人都當做了三尺之童。這些連近衞本人都不能解釋的矛盾，汪精衛偏代他曲意掩飾，這不是××××的證據是什麼？—報以二場熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>第四　注提出二點主和的理由（二）當陶德曼進行調解時，南京尙未失守，現在繼南京之後，連徐州，濟南，開封，安慶，九江，廣州，武漢，等重要城市都丟了，形勢已，張百倍，何以彼時可和而現在反不可和？（二）陶德曼進行調解時，日方提出之條干比近衛聲明更苛何以彼時可以作爲談判之舉礎四硯在反不可以？這又是一種謬說，無論陶德曼調解的一重公案，是否眞實，姑待斷；卽使退一萬步言，這是眞的，但也應該明白那已是前年間的事，時間既已不同，我們在戰略戰術上也早已有了飛躍的進步，達到足以打退×人消滅×人的階段，這是第一種變化。目前我們雖已失去了許多重要城市，但全面戰術，並不在點綫之爭奪，而重面積之佔領。現在×人在佔領區域里除了能够控制一些交通綫外，其餘的地方，中國的政權，依然仔在，政府的法令，依然通達。而且我們除了正面有雄　的正規軍阻止×人前進外，還有大批的野戰軍和廣大的游擊隊在×後活動，這　是全面戰術的運用，也就是軍事勝利的保證。汪精衞身爲國家大員，難道連國家的戰略戰術都莫明其妙，看不出一點　明的嗎？他故意散佈這些荒謬的失敗論調，事實上就是要消滅國民抗戰的意志，帮助×人對于我們的進攻！—聽者對於汗精衞的不澈底的「聰明」，表示無限的　惜！</p>
<p>林先生再說：日本一向有二個政策，除了大　政策大家都已曉得之外，他的海洋政策是以英美爲假想敵的，他在海洋上也佈置了三道防綫，假使一日第二第三兩道防綫都保不住了，就準備退到第三道防綫，第三道防綫在什麼地方呢？就在我們的東北四省，因之無論大陸政策也好，海洋政策也好，東北四省都是日本的生侖綫，汪精衛是負有重　的高級長官，豈有不知×人的軍事計割之埋，而居然也同意近衞的聲明，把偽滿認爲合法的組織，承認其存在，這是不是替×人打算？還是昏頭昏腦到不知人事的地步！</p>
<p>第五　從此，我們知道汪的人格發生問題了。××××××××××××？居然有這一副心肝來說這些話？我們知道在抗戰的時候，有多少應徵赴戰的壯士，家里父母死了或是病了，想囘去看一看，沒有空；有多少在戰地服務的婦女，家里孩子死了或是病了，想囘去看一看，沒有空；有許多在前綿作戰的官兵，懷念着年高的尊親，想寫封信去慰問一下，沒有空；這些爲了什麼？爲了要爭取國家的生存，爲了要爭取民族的解放，這是何等可感動的事—現在汪竟在「舉一個例」中說，只要我的主張得蒙採納，個人不成問題：這成什麼話！當然，主和的主張要是被採納了，自然非請他出來不可，那時汪就可登台做大官了，可是中央竟不採納他的主張呢，於是他就接着說，要是同面長此僵下去，我雖離國，也會回來，同到什麼地方去，南京，北平，廣州，就是他的去處，他的個人不成問題、就是如是解。</p>
<p>尤其使人特別憤怒的，××××××××××××××××××，這是對千整個中國軍人的污辱，我料定汪是不敢向中國的軍人講這句話的，全中國的人民也一定要怒髪衝冠的來加以制裁，」×××××××××××</p>

<p>— 夥兮</p>
<p>戯劇工作者大會見　港九各劇昨聯合歡迎中救劇團</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，像一把火種—樣，春風—時代的風—把它吹到什麼地方，那個地方立刻就熱熊熊地燃燒起來。它又像一棵新苗一樣，在什麼地於播種，那個地方就立刻萌芽生長着新的生命。他們這一　年靑的伙伴同然是可愛可敬，訓練他們生長的時　亦够偉大，够使人歌頌了。中國救亡劇團帶着濃　的火藥味從前線將到海外官慰僑胞，抵港時備受此間各團體竭誠歡迎，動人至深。本報雖然已有幾篇特寫分別報道，但是，歡迎的熱潮繼續高漲，而且各個歡迎會亦各有精采的浪花，因此，我們報道，續報道，又再來報道，我們確　這亦是有意義的，需要幹的，應該强化的一椿大事。因爲香港的「春天」够悶了，打開悶的氣氛正是生的求啊！</p>
<p>昨天本港愛國的僑胞，又有兩個盛大的歡迎會。上午九時半，是業餘聯誼社在該社舉行歡迎，一個雖然不小的第四層樓，緊緊地擠着身在海外，心在砠國的一大羣職靑年；有很多人迫得爬上旁邊的桌子凳子，園觀起來，但求這個吸收精神食糧，加强認識的機會不司錯過就是了。</p>
<p>最熱烈最動人的是杳港靑年戲劇恊會發動的港九各靑年劇團的聯合　迎會。昨晚七時假座九龍華南中學的大禮堂舉行。出席者有紅白劇團，蘆烽劇社，鐵流劇團，新聲劇社，旋風劇社，靭門劇團，中華劇社，靑年團，先鋒見童劇團，四婦女聯會宣訓班，靑年同樂社，學德勵志社，紅藍劇團，丁丑劇團，螞蟻兒童劇團，怒濤劇團，廣大劇社，自强體育社等劇劇團代表二百餘人，都是努力於戲劇運動的工作者，這眞是一個空前的最有意義的戲劇工作者的大　見。一</p>
<p>中救劇團全體團員都蒞臨參加。抵步的時候，二百餘個戲劇工作者都站起來　掌熱烈歡迎。就座後，首先是未白水先生致歡迎詞，接着，由陸浮先生對該團過去的工作來一個簡略的介紹，拉開了聯誼與研討　序幕。</p>
<p>在一陣熱烈鼓掌中，團長金山先生站起來滔滔地詳細的報告他們一年多來事救亡戲劇運動的經歷和所得到的寶貴的教訓。『中國的新興戲劇，及其燦爛的前途，完全寄托在前線與戰地中成千成萬堅苦奮鬥的靑年身上』。他講到這裏，好像挖出他的心，說出他的心內話似的。他太興奮了，全體亦深深受其感動。</p>
<p>接着，他對香港的戲劇同志提出了幾　最寶貴的　見和希望…（一）要有高度的熱情，（二）要有正確的政治認識，（三）生活要嚴肅，要大衆化，（一四）戲劇內容要切台現實，（五）歲劇工作者要大團結。</p>
<p>副團長王瑩女士報告該團服務的經過。給人印象最深刻的是：『有人說我們是教育士兵，喚起民衆，功勞很大。其實，是十兵與民衆喚起我們，教育我們。我們看到中國的正面，澈底認識中國的偉大，與未來的無限希望。我們覺悟電影明星的生活與大學生的生活是要一不得的一套，是非揚　不可的。所以，我們勞作，學習，不僅不以爲是苦，而且深深慶　這　幸福，這是眞止的進步。這種進步，並非在大學與出洋留學所能得到的。』</p>
<p>林福先生報告很多平時不容易聽到的抗戰現勢，使我們杭戰必勝的信念彌益學决。接着，老教育家方與嚴、該團小戰士范政都有動的人演講，眞是全面抗戰，人不分男女老小的實踐。國語，一廣州話，各地方言的統一一堂，又是地無分南北東西的象　。最後大家自由發表對　亡劇運的意見，掀起熱烈的討論一，有說有笑，又有茶話，緊張之中又是活潑，和諧。直中深夜十一時許，才依依不捨地暫別，大家在工作上再見。（按：因發稿時間關係，關於救亡劇運的討論，未能詳記，請參閱下期本報電影戯劇週利）。</p>

<p>無何、男女小學生一隊入館、募集飛機捐、先合唱救亡歌、「勝利的明天」、謂須、力出力、　錢出錢、導唱者爲白山風幼　白小靈、唱畢分頭向各座募捐、空軍健見、爭相慷概認捐、其他　客、亦多解囊、惟某客方向其女友獻楣、恨衆小學生歌聲打　其語辭、</p>
<p>後午高趙等偕白姊妹乘船游山、酬歌爲樂、遙見閻海文與劉女士同行抑桃閒、衆戲詢白有愛人否、白答現有兩個、一是那長白山的風、一是靑年的中國空軍、白因微笑唱歌、願自己永遠是風、吹醒痴男怨女的甘夢、吹破亂臣賊子的鼠胆、每天浮　凌空的鐵翼、吹吻着空軍　兒褐色臉面、當侵略者前來吞噬我們時、暴風起來翻捲起抵抗巨潮、吹送着益軍、願爲民族的存亡、爲世界的自由平等而抗戰——</p>

<p>並不有較多的動人的動作、當我們攝製完竣而後、扣憂這部片子在中國不會像在美國那樣受人歡迎、可是公映時的候、</p>
<p>中國的觀衆竟趨之若驚</p>
<p>『也　這部影片、所以這樣受人歡迎、中國電　觀衆的崇拜瑙瑪希拉、至少是原因之一、中國人的所以歡喜瑙瑪希拉、也目有原因、她的廋弱　貌美、是完全符合於中國人理想中的美女的」、他說、</p>
<p>他又說起米高梅的女明星、除了瑪瑙希拉之外、中國人　最歡迎的是珍尼麥唐娜、男明星當推克拉克蓋博爾爲第一、自一九三一年起、米高梅的出品、每年在上海租映的、大概自四十部　五十部。至於杳港和天津、也差不多是這樣、</p>
<p>美國的影片、發行到全個世界、凡是在不通行英語的國家、另用字幕、而碰到　若干國家禁止聽英語的、那就用　一國語言的對白收音的、這件事情、有時會使你感到非常複雜、尤其是歌曲。</p>
<p>經騐的喜劇、歷史上的故事、和一般人所稱的『家　影片』、這三種影片、在一九三八年度、米高梅視爲出品的中心、關於偉大的歌劇、此後是否將介紹到銀幕上面、據發言人所說、因好萊塢的製片者、還在猶豫、爲影片公司唯一的目的、是在賺錢、這種影片、是否能受美國觀業歡迎、還沒有把握、上將更是不同、　喜着這種影片的人怕不多、總之、影片公　所耗的錢、還是要向觀衆頭上取同來的、</p>

<h3 id="c56">旭和杯二次比賽　今日南華逢陸軍　下午四時在海軍球場舉行　南華防衛未得完整惟前線甚強可望得勝 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>【本報專訊】本屆足球六大錦標、已有半數落在我華隊之手、所餘三項、我華隊亦經達到爭標之最後關頭、惟能否全　包辦、尙有待於諸健兒之努力、蓋觀諸最近形勢、以我華隊之强而有力、實無一外隊足以攫其鋒、若不以已獲其三而滿足、更知所自勉、則包辦錦標、確有可能、願我華隊諸員。努力圖之、得完成此光榮之創作、是吾人所厚望也、</p>
<p>今日為旭和杯二次比賽之期、下午四時在海軍場舉行、此次乃採單循環及九十分鐘制、計分法如聯賽、至具起綠、亦有一述之必要、憶未舉辦此項比賽之前、有等慈善機關、以足球可　欵、遂向南　激請、派隊作慈善賽、南華以事屬　舉、無不應命、惟後來請求者日多、甚至廣州及澳門之慈　機關、亦相請南華一視同仁、予以勸助、至是南華遂窮於應付、然又碍難推辭、幾經　思、乃徵得羅旭和　紳同意、由彼捐送銀杯一座、用作獎品、故此項慈善比賽、於一九三四至三五年度產生出來、</p>
<p>其時由南華發起、得陸軍及海軍兩體育會允爲合作、乃事底於成、且公諸共辦、於是此三角式競爭之賽會、遂成爲慈善事業之一種、比賽制度、因參加者祇三隊、乃採單循環及九十分鐘制、每隊出賽二次、以續分最高者得錦標、比賽地點、則在第三者球場舉行、</p>
<p>是屆之第一戰、於去年十月閒舉行、其時海軍人材鼎盛、實力極强、遂以三比一將降軍擊敗、查以往幾屆、陸軍嘗保持必勝海軍之紀錄、惟本屆則不然、亦足見足球之戰、强者不可久恃也、</p>
<p>海軍既勝頭仗、奪標希望甚高、惟仍須視其第三戰能否攻克南華　後定、該戰於本月廿五日舉行、等於决賽也、</p>
<p>今日一役、南華於麥紹漢微恙缺席及劉慶才落選致防衞方面、編排有異、一若日前南華南與警察作特別銀牌決賽時、祇易一謝錦洪爲左中衞耳、</p>
<p>人有以南華防衞如此、實欠完整、以應付陸軍之前鋒、朱嘗無可慮、然觀日前銀牌决賽時、李國威演出、甚滿人意、郭英祺亦頭頭是道、且步驟一經習熟、表演自更佳矣、</p>
<p>降軍前銜線、不選米杜息之三傑、而　用乙組中人、見者頗爲疑惑、豈其負責人選者、獨具眼光、遂嘗識於牝牡驪　之外、然禮地士之技衞、固甚優異、吾亦數數見之矣、惟梳殊、美氏之功夫如何、則不甚淸楚、今一躍而登大雅之堂、當非下駟之材、但此次乃陸軍之生死關頭、如其得勝、尙有一練希望、敗則壽終正寢、惟人選如此、似非南華之敵也</p>
<p>依我眼光推測、南華前線、利銳莫比、有勝四球以上之可能、惟防衛略欠完整、難保不失、然敢斷最後勝利、終　南華者也、</p>

<p>— —王學政—</p>
<p>（二）　（二續）</p>
<p>行腿部運動或身體興四肢同時　動的時候、血液中所含的二氧化碳增加最速、肺臟所吸入氣的氣和所呼出的氧化碳能增至較平時多七八倍血液俯環的速度力、亦能較平時快七八倍、但在舉行『兩臂推舉』（Two-arm　Paee）『兩　攀舉』（Two-armCurl）『側舉』（Lateralraiss）甚至『背舉』（Back　Lift）的時候、心肺兩部　起的變化、很少能達到這個地步、又在運動的時候、身體內部同時還在進行一種選棵的程序、工作較多的部份、血液的供給也較多、運　時、肌　的血管擴大、使大量的血液灌注於其閒、我們祇要看腿部肌肉的大小和力量與　、肩、胸等部的差別、　可知道行腿部運動時的液注於腿部的血液必較行　、肩、胸等部的運勸時灌注於各該部的血液爲多、於是循環系統所受的影嚮也較大、</p>
<p>根據美國各大學的統計、在運動員中、患心臟病、或心臟衰弱者以徑賽家爲最多、一九一〇年世界四分之一英哩賽跑冠軍喬伍塞斯也是患心臟病而驟然身死、這的確是因運動過度而直接引起的結果、一九〇〇年耶魯大學的划船選手湯特尉拆　在競賽之後、因用力過度而患病、結果在三十五歲的時保患肺病而死、他因爲一時用力過度、以致身體受有重大的損害、逐漸表弱、不能抵抗疾病、但這種運動究竟是否殺人不見血的愚笨的體育方法？說名公道話、這並不是提倡賽跑運動和划船運動的人和運動本身的愚笨、而祇是喬氏和湯氏自己或其指導者的愚笨、</p>
<p>同學某君曾爲上海某大學附屬中學網球隊隊長、中學畢業後、轉入一所全國最著名的國立大學、被選爲第二單打、某君愛好網球、技術優良、因欲更謀深造、於是整日練習不賴、但未及一年、亦患帥病而喪生、難道網球運動也當受指斥嗎？</p>
<p>不久以前本港亦有一位拳賽家和足球員在比賽時因傷而喪生、雖道這又是殺人的體育嗎？</p>
<p>我又有一個同學、他精於足、　、綱、排等球類、也常習田徑運動、他身體看來也很强健、但是他犯手淫的惡慣、並且很嚴重、數年之後、也因患肺癆、不到兩星期卽不治、</p>
<p>例如、足球在本港非常之盛行、但是我至少知道有一個踐生反對足球甚力、其餘籃球、網球、田徑等何嘗沒有人指斥、我們絕不可盲從一人或　數人無謂的見解、</p>
<p>澄波先生旣說「本來有心病肺病的人最不宜干劇烈的運動』、又說其令弟肺部衰弱、其貫、肺部表弱的人已不可行劇烈的運動、但是適當的運動却能使肺部衰弱的人恢復健康、所謂適當的運動一方面須看運動的本身、一方面也要看各人身體的强弱和需要而定、體力强大的人所認爲是輕易的運動、在體　弱小的人也沒有能力勝任、須知柔軟體操或甚至散步對於身體非常衰弱或患病頗重的人、有時也不適宜、柔軟體操的方法錯誤、如時閒過久、呼吸錯誤、運動過　等、也有很大的弊害、網球運動雖被認爲和緩而甚適合於中年或老年人的運動、但我們曾員有些網球家在劇烈的比賽後竟疲乏至臥地不起、</p>
<p>總之、所謂劇重的運動就是須出全力的百分之六十五至八十的運動、輕易的運動則須出全力的百分之四十至五十、我們一舉一動雖然都是運動、但這並不是最有效的運動、並不能使身體發達至最强健的地步、甚至有時亦不足以保持健康、身體健全的人、每日出全力的百分之六十五至八十、運動半小時或一小時、絕不能說是過於劇烈、試看勞動者和我國前綫英的將士以及正在受訓練的靑年、他們每日所耗費的精力寶在全力的百分之六十五以上、難道他們都會患急性　炎而死嗎？唯有身體本來不健全的人、才不能勝任適當的劇重的運動、但是適當的輕易的運動常能使身體不健全的人恢復健康、所　劇車的運動、並不是完全指器械的重量而言、最重要的是運動的方式、所以在啞齡等運動中、祇要　輕器械的重量、和減少運動的次數、或縮短連　的時閒、實有不少簡易的運動是適合於身體瘦弱的人、倘若每次運動時皆出盡全力來運動、這並不是運動殺人或運動的愚笨、是我們自己的愚笨、或甚至等於自殺、</p>
<p>澄波先生告誡其令弟說、「還是好好的練深呼吸柔軟操、先要把內臟練好了、不要徒然注視外表、並且引證許多著名中外體育家的話動告他一、其實啞鈴和擴胸器運動如果方法適當、對於身體內外皆有益處、各種運動的功效、看來雖　有多少差別別、但是主要的功效却是一貫的就是發達肌肉和鍛鍊內臟、氣力、也就是促進呼吸、循環、消化、代謝等作用、於是他部噐官的官能亦隨着有莫大的增進、所以實際上各種局部的運動也能增　整个身體的健康、况且欲使內部强健、必須發達隨意肌、心、胃各部的肌肉皆爲并隨意肌、欲發達此部非意肌一方面要促進呼吸、及循環等作用、一方面要發達與此部非隨意肌接近的隨意肌、</p>
<p>澄波先生也動化的令弟注意深呼吸運動、須知深呼吸運動如不得法也有弊害、這種運動看起來雖很簡單、但對這運動有深切認識的人却寥寥無幾、卽如　部　縮的方法、肌肉的弛放、深呼吸不可過度或過於勉強、應行於運動之閒或運動之後等等皆爲一般人所忽略、若是深呼吸的方法錯誤、身體所受的損害並不在啞鈴等運動之下、我們雖然沒有聽見過那一個人因行深呼吸不得法而患急件肺炎、在短期之內喪生、但是許多有效和適當的運動却常因此而被誤斥爲愚笨或有害的方法、</p>
<p>澄波先生引證許多著名中外體育家的話來勸告他的令弟、我柏信這些中外著名的體育家絕不會把啞鈴運動和擴胸器運動視爲殺人不見血的愚笨的體育方法吧！</p>
<p>如一方面從事運動、一方面卻忽略他極健康的要素、結果不僅無益、反而有害、雖運動得法亦不能免、但是一般却沒有這種認識、竟將因此而引起的弊害完全推　於運動之上。</p>
<p>澄波先生又說『歐美人的「硬幹一的方法、已經不少有心人指斥過』、但不知澄波先生是否知道啞鈴、擴胸器和舉事等運動也經不少著名的體育家、醫生、和提俏自然療病法的人贊助過、我在上文所述各點就是他們贊助的主要　理由、我也很希望知道　波先生所謂「有心人一指斥歐美「硬幹—的方法的理由、</p>
<p>最後、澄波先生之所以「在悲痛亡弟之餘、不得不大聲疾呼、望社會上熱心的體有家和醫生一致指斥這害人的笨法」除了根據他會習這種爲他所斥爲「殺人不見血的愚笨的體育方法一的令弟、因患急性肺炎而在短促的十二天之內死了之外、不知還有沒有別的理由、廿八年四月七日、</p>

<h3 id="c64">知識份子的路 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 于塞夫</p>
<p>最初，當一個知識份子開始對自已懷疑的時候，他便會走向一條很灰暗分路去——那是可能的。</p>
<p>對自己懷疑，也有那種對客觀環境的演變不能急追直上的趨勢，於是，沒有一種堅强的力來支持；他自已也不去追尋和發現那種堅强的力，他就動搖了。</p>
<p>高爾基，對於革命前的知識份千，他說他們『可以這樣虛心的想』：「可以在主義與工人之間光明地生活着，或者這樣想，他佔着車夫與馬中閒的馬具的地位，他甚或佔着騎馬者馬脊骨當中的馬鞍的地位。」</p>
<p>接着他又說：「首先我們的知識份子——是一個勞動力，他從頭到脚都是畏着勞動民衆的肌肉，這不只是他們有血　的化學關係，——密切的積極的參加統一的勞働過程。」</p>
<p>以上，是一九三三年九月二十日M，高爾基接見了雅洛斯拉夫梁的工人代表後，高爾基寫給工人們的信件中所說的話。</p>
<p>目前，中國的知識份子在戰爭中，一般地說來，他們的功續是不可算小了，差不多每一個知識份子都盡了最大的努力，他們在火線上，在×人的後方，在後方，無論怎樣，他們始終是為了自己的祖國而献出了自己。</p>
<p>現在，讓我記下某一夜在一個偏僻的小鎭裏和救亡的知識份子的談詁吧。</p>
<p>「現在，因為學校迫近考試日期，所以一切的工作都停頓了……」</p>
<p>「那麼在平時你們的工作怎樣呢？」我問。</p>
<p>「我們組織了讀書會……在義賣的時候　便發動同學們士女們參加，竟然也賣了很多……」</p>
<p>『讀書會的進行是怎樣的？』</p>
<p>「研究些時事問題，並且盡可能地出版一些壁報，我們總想使一般同學都能參加到讓書會裏來。……但是我們不希望我們的讀書會員都只是救亡專家，我們要成為救亡工作者！」</p>
<p>談詁結來的時候，已經很夜深了。我們很熱烈地談了許多，可是沒有結論。</p>
<p>當晚，我只是如是想：</p>
<p>「他們是生活在『鬥爭』中！」自然諾要我們的知識份子是一個勞働力！把為識和行動分離了，或是把實踐與理論分離了，都是要不得的。</p>
<p>不能忘掉生活！知識份子隨時隨刻要注意工作的對象。而且，要把自己鍛鍊成一個不動搖，不畏縮的戰士。</p>
<p>一個戰士不一定握着槍。一支筆，加上一種止確的世界觀，同樣是一種有着衝鋒時的剌刀的效的的工具！</p>
<p>我們要加強調知識分子的鬥爭意識。</p>
<p>縱觀一般現象，我們的知識份子雖然是艱苦地担負起了時代的使命；為了保證使命底加速度地完成，為了保證使命底完美地完成，我們的知識份子應該不斷地和反動勢力鬥爭！</p>
<p>一方面：妥臨份子，悲觀，消極，胆怯，處處向×人卑夷地祈求投誠，並且放散着種種恐怖的絕望的空氣。</p>
<p>一方面，羣衆的熱情，不屈不撓的精神，關切的熱望，英勇的挺進。</p>
<p>可是，我們的知識份子非但要給前者以致命的無情的打擊，而且，要跟後者學習，同時，跟羣衆一起英勇地挺進，從他們之間，我們的知識份　將獲得『堅定。』</p>
<p>植物怎樣去吸收泥土裏的滋養？植物為什麼需要太陽？我們的知識份子，應該怎樣才不致使自己貧血？</p>
<p>挺進吧。選擇我們的路！考究怎樣在我們的路上挺進</p>
<p>中國正處在這麼偉大的時代裏，我們的知識份子應該以「馬其」「馬鞍」的地位而轉入一個利更新的地位去：</p>
<p>我們將有那麼一天的，正如我們的詩人示着抗戰前途底謳歌一樣，我們鬥爭下去，會得着最後勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c65">窗子以外 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 李丹</p>
<p>徘徊在窗子的外面，對于窗眞是不勝羨慕之至。試想從窗子裏望見綿遠的　山，一片白帆　靜地從海面浮過去，這是多麼地令窗子內的人陶醉的一　圖畫啊！</p>
<p>然而在這人生障壁的角落裏，窗之於我已證實是一件與我無緣的東西，雖然我曾經熱烈地追求過。</p>
<p>有人認為窗是屋子的眼睛，沒有窗的屋子好比瞎了眼睛的人，而我就終年終月度眼瞎不的生活，雖是上帝在創造我的時候不曾少給我一對眼睛，但在這黑暗的角落裏，它可沒有X光的作用能够望得見板壁以外的世界</p>
<p>當輪會送我來到此地，從海邊望見密層層的樓宇，上都閃耀　誘人的窗牖，我私心慶幸，以為自已能够生活在這一個多窗的世界裏。但是經過一年的經驗，我才知道在這個多窗的世界裏還有許多摒在窗子以外度着瞎子生活像我自己一樣的人。</p>
<p>曾經有好幾次，設法去尋求一個窗，而事實却告訴我，在這個這窗的世界裊，社會是崎形地劃開了兩個階層，一個是有窗的，一個是無窗的，有窗的住在窗子以內，無窗的屏在窗子以外，窗便是劃分兩個階層的鴻溝，彼此不容混亂，于是祇得仍舊　到窗子以外的壁籠裏，從此再就个敢存妄想。</p>
<p>有一次我去拜會一个有窗階級的朋友，出乎我意外的那窗以內正如我的壁籠裏　一樣陰暗，因為所有窗子都給布條遮蔽着。我問他為什麼？他說出兩個理由：第一是因爲要避免街道上的　土和强烈的陽光，所以寧頤屋裏幽暗一點；第二是因爲生怕外面的人看得見自己不願被人看見的事情，所以　布幕遮蔽着，寧願自己不能望出去，我才恍然知道窗不是永久被人祟拜的東西，而這陰暗的墻籠裏　有值得令人羨暴之處：塵囂雖不能完全避免，但陽光從來沒有一分一寸投射得進來；雖然自己好像缺少了眼晴，可是也不至給別人來做了眼睛，且不瞥自己沒有不願被人看見的事情。</p>
<p>窻在我的理想中從此就起了搖動。</p>
<p>最近在桂林，看見許多在岩洞裏建設起　的學校，那一羣一羣的孩子　天背着鋪蓋提着書包到岩洞裏上課，在×機不斷轟炸之下使他們更能努力，更能發奮。那陰森的岩洞裏當然談不到窗，然而他們就這樣在石墻下得到知識，得到健康的生長。固然他們是可嘲笑地生活在離開窗不很遠的人生障壁的角落裏，可是從窗子以外他們却認識了人生達摩。面壁九年因而悟澈玄宗的故事，雖然不可盡信，但是這却提示不了在幽暗的角落裏也有它偉大的存在，光明不是依靠外來，而是在乎自我的發出。</p>
<p>從此我更不希罕一個窗，我仍舊生活在窗子以外的壁籠裏，四壁雖是沒有窗，而窗却在我的心裏開敞着。</p>
<p>當我漫步在街頭，從窗子以外我沒有注意到窗子以內有沒　不願被人看見的事情，但那垂掛着的窗帝已然是告訴我所負的是甚麼使命了。</p>

<p>「同志，我還要負擔同樣的一種工作，抵補我這次的失敗。可是，這次失敗的責任……」</p>
<p>她不耐煩於這長久的等待了，他的聽明又唆使她做第二次的試驗：</p>
<p>「你是放我走？還是帶著我的死屍去？你要快點兒決定，立刻，立刻！」</p>
<p>她永不冒險，祇有冒險的試驗，因為她是弱者。但是，她不曾想到這試驗啓發了他的一種智慧：</p>
<p>「是的，我帶著你的死屍去。我在附近無人的地方，把你的死屍埋起來。我可以隨便地走回去，然後，仍向你家索欵。除去我和我的同志以外，有離知道你家贖回去的，祇是你的死屍呢？」</p>
<p>於是，他決定以她的血而完成自己的責任和工作：雖然，她是無辜的。</p>
<p>他想到責任，工作，他快樂，成功的快樂。但是，他看到她，他悲哀了，比失敗，也許還悲哀。　（卅二）</p>

<p>窗外的風吹得樹枝發響，太陽昏沉沉的將沒落了，……</p>
<p>紅毛槍插在地下，門口和村郊都設了防哨，整個茅津台寂寞得沒有一聲犬吠和鷄叫，只有從野山頭上吹下來的狂風吼呌着呼——呼</p>

<p>遙遠的平原里，爬仆若許多蔭鬱的村莊，小河像一條白帶似的閃光，給風吹縐了；曠野里烟沉沈的，一片樹木，或一槐草田像是蔭　的影子。</p>
<p>附近的村子里，人們都逃得得乾乾淨凈，据那農夫講（暫時還稱農夫吧），都搬進鼎湖山去住。</p>
<p>「為什麼山里人也要逃？」</p>
<p>「這里的山小，山里還有比這山高大幾十倍的。」</p>
<p>吐吐吐……鍋子里的飯沸騰起來，他匆匆把蓋了鍋口的一個圓席子掀開，一陣蒸氣衝上來，鍋子裏的稀飯冒着汽泡。</p>
<p>那農夫用一個長枘的椰壳勺在鍋子里攪了攪，一股熱米的香氣冲着我們的鼻孔。</p>
<p>「吃吧，弟兄們。稀飯熱了」。</p>
<p>可是飯碗不够分配，大家便用自已的椰壳子盛了稀飯，折斷秣楷做筷子。這樣把一大鍋稀飯都喝完了，大家的臉上都滲露出紅潤的顏色，彷彿都健康了起來。</p>
<p>這天夜里，我們的隊伍就紮在這個小小的山村裏，把沒有人住的房門打開，進去睡覺。在村郊和山坡上放哨的弟兄，遙望着山坡平原裏那黑黝黝的土丘和村影。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Steps in Japan's Invasion of China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japan's various internal and external policies have indeed been quite chaotic and contradictory. For example, on the one hand, the growing anti-long-term war sentiments among various domestic strata are compelling the Japanese government to adopt a policy of appeasement. On the other hand, it is more actively launching military offensives against China, expanding the war. In diplomatic terms, on the one hand, it is launching movements to exclude countries that aid China, such as the United States and France, especially the anti-British movement. On the other hand, it is trying every possible means to threaten and entice countries such as Britain and the United States to act as mediators in order to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is kowtowing to the Soviet Union to establish a new Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement while simultaneously initiating hostilities against the Soviet Union on the Soviet-Manchukuo border. This further demonstrates the chaos of Japan's diplomatic policy toward the Soviet Union and exposes the discord within Japan and the conflict of opinions on Soviet diplomacy. However, amidst these contradictions and oppositions, there is a clear new trend. According to our observations, Japanese strategists are indeed aware of their fatigue and eagerly hope to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. Even the warmongering military has this anxious attitude.</p>
<p>The method previously used by Japanese strategists to end the Sino-Japanese War was to use all their strength to subdue our anti-Japanese government. However, after twenty months of protracted and foolish actions, our anti-Japanese government has not only not been conquered, but has instead become stronger and stronger. Although the Japanese side has consistently declared its non-recognition of our anti-Japanese government as the central government, the support of various countries around the world for our anti-Japanese government has become more resolute and active, especially the support from Britain recently. Japan's first plan to end the war has been completely shattered. Japan's second step to end the Sino-Japanese War was to use heavy money and favorable conditions to buy over traitors and create internal chaos and civil war in China in order to achieve the effect of "using Chinese to control Chinese." However, Wu Peifu was not deceived by Japan's conspiracy, and Wang Jingwei was discredited by all Chinese people for being fooled and completely lost his basis for activities. After Zeng Zhongming's death, he may simply go all the way, but his collapsed situation has been determined, and Japan's political offensive can also be said to have completely failed.</p>
<p>The only possible method for Japan at present is to actively promote military actions to invade China, complete its so-called "Itagaki Armistice Line," and on the other hand, threaten and entice third countries to come forward to mediate. The foreign news reported by the Chongqing Central News Agency a few days ago claimed that the Japanese government has also decided on several political conspiracies against us and ordered its military leaders in China to earnestly implement them. There are two key points among them: (1) Do everything possible to blockade the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China, and try to force and entice Britain, the United States, and France to serve as mediators. (2) Vigorously propagate anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as a smokescreen to deceive the world and deceive our country. These messages are indeed quite reliable. The military actions are coordinated. After the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, it is more actively advancing westward. It is faintly heard that they are妄想 to occupy Changsha before April 15th. According to a certain rumor, the Japanese army recently added one division in central China, × division in North China, and × division in South China. Its military actions against China are indeed quite aggressive. Its purpose is to穿成打通 the Yuehan Railway, connecting the "Itagaki Armistice Line" from Xi'an in the north, through Changsha, to Beihai in the south, in order to prepare for a temporary end to the Sino-Japanese War and make its long-term construction dreams (?).</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there must be a strong third country to come forward to mediate. Therefore, although it launched anti-British and anti-British movements due to Britain's massive support for the Chinese anti-Japanese war with the resilient legal currency, it has always held ardent expectations for Britain, hoping that Britain can still come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Although the anti-British movement has expanded from Japan to the occupied areas of China, it still contains thick expectations. Since Japan must please Britain, and even France and the United States, it naturally wants to show its ugly face as an anti-socialist country. Thus, on the one hand, it lightly initiates hostilities on the Soviet-Manchukuo border, and on the other hand, it expands the anti-communist and anti-Soviet smokescreen. This is all a consistent style of Japan.</p>
<p>We believe that this new step by the Japanese aggressors is still a pipe dream. The "Itagaki Armistice Line" cannot be easily realized as hoped. Even if several divisions are added to the army, it is still ineffective, because our army's various lines have been fully prepared and are about to begin a counter-offensive. The Japanese army is already finding it difficult to defend against our army's counter-offensive. The 全綫 的進展 is even more of a dream. On the one hand, the British ambassadors to Japan and China, and the French ambassador to China, have gathered in Shanghai, but the issues discussed will undoubtedly be nothing more than how to safeguard their interests in China and how to deal with the plans of the aggressors in the Far East. All our people expect this way, and we observe this way. The development of the matter should not be beyond our expectations! Japan's 急燥的 "狼奔豕突" will only deepen his泥足.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Crisis of Capitalist Countries: Unemployed Workers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Boragov, Translated by Wu Kejian</p>
<p>For more than a year, the capitalist world has been in a new economic crisis. The working class of capitalist countries has not yet recovered from the severe pain of the world economic crisis that began in 1929 and is once again shouldering all the burdens of the economic crisis: increasing numbers of unemployed workers, wage cuts, hunger, and poverty.</p>
<p>The most important feature of the new economic crisis is that it erupted under the conditions of the Second Imperialist War, which has already begun for the division of the world. A large portion of the human population has already been drawn into this war.</p>
<p>The process of impoverishing the working class by the crisis and war has become more acute. As a result of the crisis and war, the bankruptcy of small-scale industrialists and merchants in Japan and Germany has reached a particularly large scale. Naturally, this will cause a huge development of hidden unemployment, the scope of which is unlimited.</p>
<p>During the First Imperialist War, Lenin wrote: "This is how economic life is 'regulated' in capitalist countries, that is, military servitude is imposed on the workers (including part of the peasants), while paradise is created for bankers and capitalists. Their regulation consists in 'leading' the workers into starvation, while guaranteeing (secretly and in a reactionary bureaucratic manner) higher profits for bankers and capitalists than before the war." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 22, Page 167) The correctness of Lenin's assessment is clearly visible at present. In recent years, capitalist countries, especially Germany, Japan, and Italy, have been "regulating economic life" in this way.</p>
<p>When the new economic crisis began in the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, there was already a large number of unemployed workers. For example, in the United States, in the summer of 1927, according to the minimum estimate, there were eight million unemployed workers. In Britain, there were 1.5 million. Even during the months when the economic situation was better in these countries after the crisis began in 1929, this was still the case. This is already a minimum limit, and the number of unemployed workers below this limit has not been reached.</p>
<p>In the first year of the recent economic crisis, the increase in unemployed workers was much faster than in the first year of the 1929 economic panic. For example, in the United States in the past year, the number of unemployed workers increased by three million. At the present time, the total number of unemployed workers, according to the statistics of the American Labor Alliance, is 11 million.</p>
<p>Regarding the scope of unemployed workers in capitalist countries, we can calculate according to the following statistics from the monthly chronicle reports of the League of Nations: In the country, one in every five workers and staff members is unemployed. (A year ago, it was one unemployed worker in ten people.) In Britain, it is one unemployed worker in every seven workers. In Belgium, one in every four workers is fully or partially unemployed. In Ireland, one in every four workers is unemployed. In Canada, one in every eight workers is unemployed. The situation of unemployed workers in the United States has only reduced the number of workers in the mining industry by two million since the beginning of the crisis, which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in workers. This means that one in every four people who had a job a year ago has now been pushed out onto the street. Those workers who remain in the enterprise only work a few days a week. This illustrates the fact that since the beginning of the crisis, wages have been reduced by 36 percent, while the number of workers has also been reduced by 25 percent.</p>
<p>In heavy industry, unemployment is even more serious. In important industrial centers such as steel, coal, and automobiles, more than one-third of the workers are unemployed.</p>
<p>The situation of the British working class is not much better. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Labor in the past eight years, one in every six insured workers and staff members is unemployed. Before the new crisis began, there had been some reduction in unemployed workers, but when the new crisis began at the end of 1937, it increased again. In 1938, the number of unemployed workers increased by 400,000 compared to 1917. At present, the number of unemployed workers has reached two million again. For example, in the cotton textile industry, one in every three workers is unemployed. In the shipbuilding industry, one in every four workers is unemployed. In coal mines, one in every five workers is unemployed. In the construction industry, one in every workers is unemployed. These situations are occurring in the most important sectors of Britain.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the increase in armaments has slowed down the development of unemployment in many industrial sectors, especially in the machinery manufacturing and shipbuilding sectors. However, the increase in demand for goods in these sectors cannot compensate for the sharp reduction in commercial orders. The number of unemployed workers in these sectors has increased. For example, even in the shipbuilding industry, which has completed a large number of military orders, 50 percent of the shipyards have stopped work.</p>
<p>The above situation is even greater in the cotton textile industry and the 　. After a few years of temporary improvement, the industry is once again facing a period of extremely serious crisis. In the past year alone, 120,000 weavers have lost their jobs. The government and capitalists are trying to improve its situation by destroying the "surplus" equipment in the cotton industry. In the past two years alone, more than four million spindles—the equipment of forty large factories—have been eliminated. However, the situation has not improved as a result.</p>
<p>In the past year, the number of unemployed workers in France has also increased. According to official statistics in November 1938, the number of registered unemployed workers was 401,000, compared to 362,000 in November 1937. The number of partially unemployed workers increased from 7.5 percent in September 1937 to 18.3 percent in September 1938.</p>
<p>In recent months, the number of unemployed workers in Japan has increased sharply. The increase in unemployed workers is not only due to the bankruptcy of small-scale industrialists and merchants and peasants, but also due to the unemployment of industrial workers. In many sectors of industry, production has been reduced due to the lack of raw materials. Recently, not only have thousands of enterprises been closed, but there have also been many large factories and workshops. According to the statistics of Japanese bourgeois newspapers, there are currently 1.8 million unemployed workers in Japan. In addition, there are three million people who only work a few days a week.</p>
<p>German fascist newspapers like to disseminate information about the 細滅 of the number of unemployed workers already registered at the labor exchange. However, the newspapers are silent about the fact that the labor exchange has now become an agency for mobilizing the unemployed to do compulsory work, and tens of thousands of unemployed workers are being dispatched by the labor exchange in a compulsory manner to do military construction and strategic road construction. In reality, there are millions of unemployed workers in Germany.</p>
<p>At present, in the capitalist world, crisis and war are giving the working class and laboring masses new and more serious 　. In the Soviet Union, the socialist system is further consolidating the happiness of the laboring masses, developing year after year. In the socialist country, the phenomenon of unemployed workers has been eliminated forever.</p>
<p>In the second Stalinist Five-Year Plan, the number of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union increased by 17.6 percent. The average annual wage increased by 113.5 percent. And the wage fund increased by 150 percent.</p>
<p>The third Five-Year Plan has already indicated a new increase in the number of workers and staff members by 17 percent, an increase in wages by 25 percent, and a wage fund of 65 percent. The consumption of the laboring masses should increase by more than half.</p>
<p>In capitalist countries, things are getting worse, poverty, hunger, and unemployment. In socialist countries, the happiness, culture, and affluent life of the laboring masses are constantly developing. (Translated from Pravda) Lin Jiayue Xia Jiechang Zheng Zhihuan</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Current Tasks of Hong Kong Youth and Students <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jiayue Xia Jiechang Zheng Zhihuan</p>
<p>【公子哥兒】(Young Masters), 【皇家子弟】(Royal Children), or even 【白面書生】(Pale-faced Scholars). However, since the outbreak of the war, due to the awakening of Hong Kong students, their continuous service to the country, and their diligent hard work, they have gradually become "Youth Warriors."</p>
<p>This period of 　 transformation is certainly due to the brutal aggression of × imperialism and the influence of the new Chinese history. However, the waves of the Chinese student movement, which have stirred up the surging Hong Kong student movement, are also undeniable.</p>
<p>Precisely because of the anti-Japanese people's war and the rapid development of the Chinese youth movement, Hong Kong students have demonstrated a strong and great force during the anti-Japanese war: such as the establishment of the All-Hong Kong Student Relief Association, the enthusiastic fundraising of all Hong Kong students, and the enthusiastic participation of all Hong Kong students in national service and military service. Other things such as sending representatives to the Chinese Student Federation and the World Youth Conference, obtaining the appointment of anti-alliance with the world youth's sponsorship, all show that the local student movement, although on the other hand, the more cautious students have not been mobilized, the 　　 work is still not closely carried out, the lack of self-education, and the neglect of the struggle for the interests of the students themselves all show that the work of the Hong Kong students has not been fully developed. However, we believe that this shortcoming is not enough to affect the forward movement of the entire student movement. On the contrary, it encourages Hong Kong students to go further and seize freedom, equality, and happiness for the motherland! Therefore, in addition to paying special attention to and focusing on the support of South China students and overseas youth, we also express our warm hope to the students in Hong Kong to earnestly implement the following tasks, and to make the Chinese people's liberation movement, with the support and strong support of Chinese youth students, flourish and glorify! First, consolidate the student relief and support association. The student relief and support association, a stronghold of Hong Kong students, is a unique institution for all Hong Kong students. Its constituent parts are more than 300 schools of all sizes in Hong Kong. In the past and present, it has constantly written a new history of the Hong Kong student movement. As far as the Chinese and South China student movements are concerned, it has also played a very great role. Due to the grand scale of the student association, the strict organization, and the superior work, the Hong Kong students should actively consolidate and enrich this historically significant fortress—the relief association. As for how to build and enrich it, I will especially provide it here: (1) All Hong Kong students must understand the work of the student relief 　 and the work of the student relief association, and participate in the work of the student relief association. (2) To take responsibility for propagandizing to teachers and students how to support the relief and enrich the student relief, and to closely promote and implement all the work launched by the student relief association. (3) Help the district committee, section committee, and work within the school. Second, intensify relief work. The invasion of the × people and the殘我 of the × people have caused the children of China to流　失所 and have no home to return to. The misery cannot be described even in a thousand words. Therefore, relief work should be intensified. Although Hong Kong students have made great efforts in the past relief work, such as food rationing campaigns, shopping campaigns, and fundraising campaigns, the numbers are still very small. (The student relief association has raised more than one year, but it still 　 exceeds 　 the injured yuan.) 　 Looking around, the 　鴻遍野 is touching. Therefore, in the future, I hope that the students in Hong Kong will donate enthusiastically, and I especially hope that the students in Hong Kong will offer advice to their parents and friends in various ways, so that they will strive to provide relief and donate generously under the principle of doing what they can with money and effort. Third, strengthen international propaganda. Hong Kong is a hub for international people and an important hub for the motherland's external propaganda. In the past, Hong Kong students did not neglect their work on international propaganda. For example, in the proposals passed by the first and second sessions of the 　 Relief Association, strengthening international 　 propaganda work occupied a major position. Unfortunately, the implementation was not effective and failed to have a great impact. In the future, strengthen ties with youth organizations around the world and the International Anti-Aggression Movement Association. Use the exchange and exhibition of texts, pictures, and films to actively mobilize and promote it, so that international propaganda is strengthened. For individuals, due to the good English proficiency of Hong Kong students, 　 conduct individual 　 preparatory work at any time and any place to ensure that international people strengthen their support. Fourth, 切　 Implement anti-traitor work. The deeper and more persistent the Anti-Japanese War, the more rampant the activities of general wavering compromise elements will be. Therefore, it is urgent to execute the anti-traitor work and strike at the activities of traitors. Fifth, fight for the interests of the student community itself. In the past, the general youth student movement lacked attention to fighting for and improving the youth and student themselves and their upbringing. This is a serious shortcoming. In the future, in addition to the real connection between the people's liberation movement and the student liberation movement, we should actively implement the struggle for the interests of the student community itself. However, the struggle for the interests of students requires the unity and solidity of the student community. Therefore, how to unite all the students in Hong Kong, such as strengthening the unified cooperation and front of the students, has become a prerequisite. For the sake of "student interests" and "youth liberation," I hope that the students in Hong Kong will unite and strive together to strengthen self-education. Self-education work in the Anti-Japanese War is an urgent need now, because only by understanding the anti-Japanese situation of the motherland, the international situation, and the objective environment and subjective forces, as well as other guiding issues such as protracted war and the national united front, can we increase knowledge and enrich literacy. Therefore, strengthening self-education has become the main task at present. We students ourselves, for the sake of our own future and our own knowledge, it is urgently needed to strengthen theoretical cultivation and arm ourselves! Seventh, carry out work within the core. In most schools in Hong Kong, except for the larger ones, the establishment of student associations has not yet been established. Even in the established ones, the expansion of the work and the mobilization of students have not been specific, so that the main activities of some students are not connected with the war of resistance. From now on, in order to strengthen the work of saving the country by students, teachers, and students, join hands to go deep into the schools and carry out all the work in the schools, so that the life of every student is connected with the war of resistance! Eighth, connect teachers from various schools. Uniting youths of all classes is an urgent need. In the past, there was a very deep 　　 between teachers and students in general schools, and the connection with the youth body and the youth of various classes was also not as good. This has a great impact on the development and exertion of the work. We should let everyone—teachers, youths, and students—join hands under the standpoint of "Anti-Japanese first" and "National supremacy" to jointly promote all death-defying work. Ninth, unite overseas youths. Hong Kong students are the outposts of overseas youths in our country. Due to the importance of Hong Kong, Hong Kong students occupy a leading role in the position of overseas youth students. However, the work of youths and students in Hong Kong lacks links and unites the work of overseas youths, forming "isolation of work." This is a serious weakness. In order to unite overseas youths and unify overseas youth movements, earnestly implementing links and uniting overseas youths cannot be ignored. Tenth, mobilize students to return to China to serve. Hong Kong youth and students' return to China to serve was once surging and reached a peak. From the war of resistance to the present, no less than a thousand Hong Kong youths have devoted themselves to the motherland's embrace. However, the territory of the motherland is 　 big, and a thousand soldiers are still not enough. For the sake of the sacred war of resistance, we need to mobilize a large number of students to return to China to serve and strive for the final victory of the Chinese people!</p>
<h3 id="e4">Spring Arrives in Jiangnan: Inspecting the Eastern Battlefield, Holding Important Meetings, Morale Soars on the Borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Correspondent, Hait Special Dispatch] As orioles sing and vegetation thrives, spring has arrived in Jiangnan. Since the fall of Nanchang, the situation on the Jiangnan battlefield has become increasingly critical. The authorities have long been prepared, and Mr. Zhou Enlai has personally visited the eastern front to inspect various locations and direct defense efforts. From eastern and western Zhejiang to the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, military deployments have been largely completed, morale is high, and indignation is fervent. Meanwhile, agricultural and industrial activities continue as before, with a sense of prosperity. This news will surely excite fellow countrymen in the south. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai Inspects Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai, Minister of the Political Department of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, was ordered to inspect the joyful battlefield and, due to the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, advanced his inspection of various locations in eastern Zhejiang. He held military conferences with Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the the 3rd War Zone, and Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in a certain location in Zhejiang. He instructed on coastal and river defenses in eastern Zhejiang. It is reported that the defense of the Qiantang River area will be the responsibility of Huang Shaoxiong's troops, while the area along the Fuchun River will be the responsibility of Ge Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Group Army, by order of Gu Zhutong. All arrangements have been completed and martial law has been implemented. Japanese troops who attempted to cross the Fuchun River and land were severely attacked by the garrison. The landing Japanese troops retreated to places like Zhao Jiaqiao. A certain defense unit belonging to the 3rd Group Army has arrived at its designated destination and is launching a general offensive against the Japanese troops. According to travelers from Zhao Jia Village in Fuyang County, which is across the Fuchun River, the area is a war zone and heavily guarded. All residents must have certificates and wear identification badges. The Japanese troops who attempted to cross the Fuchun River were only about seven li away from Zhao Jia Village.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Motorboats Head South from Shanghai</p>
<p>A foreign ship captain who arrived in Shanghai on the evening of March 24 reported seeing hundreds of Japanese motorboats speeding south from Wusong towards Hangzhou Bay. It is believed that the main force of the Japanese army intends to land along the Zhejiang coast. The type of motorboats used is the same as those used by the Japanese naval landing forces. According to people from Ningbo, Japanese warships fiercely bombarded the Zhenhai Fortress again on Thursday morning. The defending troops returned fire. The Japanese troops did not attempt to land. It is reported that among the Japanese warships constantly bombarding the area was an inspection vessel. It is also reported that a Japanese warship was spotted in the western waters of Xiangshan Port, seemingly passing through. It is said that the number of Japanese warships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang has increased to more than ten. Recently, the coast of eastern Zhejiang has suffered repeated harassment from the Japanese, causing the shipping traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang to be on the verge of being cut off. According to sources in the shipping industry, our military defenses in eastern Zhejiang are extremely solid. At the same time, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places have significant importance for the adjustment of materials with Shanghai, which is closely related to the economic life of the people. Therefore, efforts must be made to maintain Shanghai-Zhejiang traffic as much as possible. However, all ships departing from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places will strictly prohibit young men from boarding. Women and the elderly, after obtaining export permits from the county government, can purchase tickets and board the ships.</p>
<p>Important Meeting on Tianmu Mountain</p>
<p>Since Japanese naval harassment along the Zhejiang coast aimed to coordinate with the Japanese army's advance into western Zhejiang, our military authorities immediately held an important meeting on Tianmu Mountain to redistribute defense responsibilities. Five divisions were deployed to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. On the Qiantang River front, the 3rd Group Army commanded by Ge Jianxu has concentrated a large force, determined not to allow the enemy to cross the river and to launch a counter-offensive. Around the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, the 62nd Division and the Independent 45th Brigade are very active. According to reliable sources, the Japanese troops entrenched in the Xinshi area have recently been cleared out by the Xie Regiment of the 62nd Division. The Japanese army's lifeline in the rear, the Shanghai-Suzhou Road, is controlled by Zhu Xi's Jiangnan Advance Army. This unit is largely composed of soldiers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and possesses strong strength. Last autumn, they once recovered Nanzing and Huzhou, alarming the Japanese troops. They were subsequently ordered to the rear for intensified training and reorganized into an elite force. Since January this year, they have wantonly harassed Taizhou, Zhenhai, Dinghai, and other places along the eastern Zhejiang coast, and have been patrolling and looting fishing boats and searching foreign ships. According to news from foreign ships arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou and Ningbo, Japanese warships are no longer seen along the eastern Zhejiang coast. The waters of Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, Fenghua Port, Xiangshan Port, and Zhoushan Port are all calm. However, the garrison troops are maintaining strict defenses, and vigilance has not been relaxed.</p>
<p>Residents in Zhenhai Voluntarily Relocate</p>
<p>In Zhenhai, the situation has been relatively peaceful since the cessation of naval battles, but many residents have voluntarily relocated. It is reported that the entire city has fewer than 800 households, and only about half of the shops are open. The Party, government, and military circles in Zhenhai convened a meeting on March 26 at the Zhenhai Police Bureau to discuss the defense of Greater Zhenhai. Among the proposals was a plan to lock down Dazha River (i.e., the mouth of the Yong River), but it was not approved due to its impact on travelers and cargo transportation. The previous rumors in Shanghai about Zhenhai closing the harbor gate can thus be proven to be false. The old "Taiping" vessel, which is prepared to block the Zhenhai harbor gate in case of emergency, is still berthed at the China Merchants Wharf east of Zhenhai and has not been moved. After the Shanghai-Dinghai shipping route was suspended, shipping between Ningbo and Dinghai continued as usual, facilitating the transportation of goods and passengers. Therefore, passengers and goods traveling from Shanghai to Dinghai still have to go through Ningbo. Although authorities have banned shipping vessels from stopping at the coast of Shipu, in order to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, Lida is permitted to sail once a week on Saturdays. All other shipping vessels are strictly prohibited from stopping. The Shanghai-Taizhou routes will not be served for the time being. In seconds, Deputy Commander Wang Hesong will first lead a capable detachment and take the opportunity to advance on the Suzhou-Jiaxing road, while Commander-in-Chief Zhu Xi, after the Tianmu Mountain meeting, has consulted Chairman of Zhejiang Province Huang Shaoxiong for instructions and will soon lead his troops to cooperate with the regular army to launch widespread guerrilla warfare and complete the task of threatening and containing the enemy. The situation in western Zhejiang will soon become tense again.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Attempt to Invade Zhejiang</p>
<p>Reports from Xinhua indicate that the Japanese troops attacking Nanchang are showing signs of advancing into western Zhejiang. The military and political authorities of the Chinese army, Liu Jianxu, Huang Shaoxiong, Zhou Enlai, and others, have gone to various locations to meticulously deploy defenses. No fewer than 200,000 Chinese troops are concentrated on the Zhejiang coast, ready to fight. If the Japanese army invades, they will pay a heavy price. Our reporter learned from foreign shipping circles in the city yesterday that Japanese planes have been flying over various locations in Zhejiang and Jiangxi in recent days for reconnaissance. On the morning of the 26th, Ningbo issued air raid alerts twice. The first time, the sound of aircraft was heard, but they did not enter the airspace and the alert was lifted. The second time, three Japanese planes were spotted circling over Yuyao and dropped bombs on Linshanwei, causing no losses. The third time was at 8 p.m., when Ningbo implemented a blackout, and Zhenhai also did the same until 9:50 p.m. Two Japanese planes flew to the coast of Shangyu on the afternoon of the 26th for reconnaissance and dropped bombs over Li, destroying several civilian houses and killing two civilians. They then flew to Songling and wreaked havoc, causing no damage. At 2 p.m. on the 28th, a Japanese plane flew over Baiguan in Shangyu and dropped three bombs, destroying seven houses. It then flew to Songxia Town and dropped a bomb, hitting the Linhe Medical Team, killing and injuring three people.</p>

<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>This resolute response was not merely verbal agreement, but was indeed put into action. We see that every Chinese political party is mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses under the same slogan, in order to coordinate with the Central Government and the military authorities.</p>
<p>The resolute attitude of the Chinese people towards the Wang Jingwei incident has surprised foreign observers in China. When Wang Jingwei suddenly fled Chongqing and ran to Hong Kong, it was the Gregorian New Year. That night, many foreigners in the Chongqing International Club whispered about this matter, thinking that China might split again and create an irreparable situation, to the point that the Central Government and the Kuomintang itself would experience great turmoil. When Wang Jingwei sent a telegram to the Chairman of the Commission requesting acceptance of the Konoe peace terms, many foreign political observers thought that Chiang's discord would be the final decision in the path that the Chinese people truly wanted to take. A few days later, the Central Government and the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a strict disposition regarding Wang Jingwei's betrayal, which gave the foreign press a great shock.</p>
<p>The fact that Wang Jingwei was expelled from the party and all his powers were removed not only expressed the attitude of the Chinese Kuomintang towards the War of Resistance, but also manifested the unanimous demands of the national public opinion. Therefore, Wang Jingwei's expulsion from the party was not only a resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, but was also the decision in the hearts of the people throughout the country. This phenomenon signifies the unity of the nation and the high expression of national spirit. This great spirit can not only deal a fatal blow to the external enemy, Japanese imperialism, but also deter all vacillating traitors from ever raising their heads.</p>
<p>Finally, we came to Guilin, where we stayed for two weeks. In this short time, we deeply understood that not only soldiers, political parties, and the government were concentrating all their efforts on the War of Resistance, but all the people were demanding resistance and doing their best to support it. I saw with my own eyes the Japanese bombing this small county brutally. On average, one in five houses was destroyed. Even the place where I lived suffered two bombings. In these two bombing experiences, I saw all the citizens, young and old, quickly and fearlessly entering the air-raid shelters upon hearing the alarm. Standing in Guilin's solid and natural air-raid shelters, I also saw many students and professors using books to explain to the citizens the necessary knowledge and techniques related to military affairs, air defense, national salvation, etc. Therefore, during air-raid alerts, there were absolutely no civilians on the streets except for armed medical personnel patrolling. However, less than ten minutes after the all-clear signal, the streets returned to their normal state. Once, after the all-clear signal, I went with the director of Guilin's Public Security Bureau and several friends from the provincial government to inspect the situation at the bombed train station. Japanese planes dropped a total of twelve bombs next to the station, but the result was that neither the tracks nor the trains at the station suffered any damage. We arrived at the station fifteen minutes after the all-clear signal, and all the places damaged by the bombs had already been repaired by the workers. This kind of shock work spirit really made me feel excited, sighed, and admired!</p>
<p>Li Meng spoke very enthusiastically, gesturing as if he were lecturing in front of a large audience, and a slight sweat appeared on his forehead. Mrs. Li handed him a handkerchief and said, "It's a pity that your long and wonderful lecture only has two listeners. Well, let me conclude it for you! The Japanese are trying to shake the will of the people in the rear to resist the war with crazy bombing, but I believe that the more fiercely the Japanese planes bomb, the more it will increase the Chinese people's hatred and strengthen their determination to resist to the end!" I nodded in agreement with her conclusion. It was already eleven o'clock, and the outside of the window was a dark background, with a few sparse stars shining in the sky. Everyone was not sleepy, and went to sleep in the mutual "good night" voices.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Simultaneous Offensives on All Fronts: We Smash the Japanese Invasion Plan, Japanese Attempts to Seize Changsha in Hunan and Jiangxi are Thwarted, Guangdong Japanese Troops Are Surrounded and Unable to Advance <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Chongqing, May 5] To smash the Japanese invasion plan, our forces have launched simultaneous offensives on all fronts in the south. Counter-offensives are progressing smoothly in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong. Japanese attempts to invade Changsha via separate routes from Jiangxi and Hunan have been thwarted. Small groups of Japanese troops harassing southern Guangdong have been attacked from both the north and west. In the past three days, they have suffered 2,000 casualties and lost their ability to operate. Our large army is secretly deployed along the coast of Guangdong and Guangxi. The Japanese plot to contain and divert our attention has failed.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, May 9] A certain Chinese newspaper claims that the Chinese army has recovered Jiangmen, and the northern route has advanced to eleven kilometers north of Guangzhou. It believes that the situation in Guangdong has new developments. The Japanese army is currently planning to attack Xinjie. According to another report from the front lines, the Chinese army is currently attacking Sanshui, and Chinese aircraft are also extremely active. Japanese army positions have been almost completely destroyed. As for the Dingzhou front, the situation has not changed. Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to cross the Jinjiang River to attack Shanggao, but have not yet succeeded. Japanese troops in Tongcheng are attacking the Hunan border and have encountered Chinese forces in the mountainous area, where fierce fighting is currently taking place.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues in Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>[Reuters, Macau, May 5] Various reports that the Chinese army has completely recovered Jiangmen appear to be exaggerated. Fierce fighting is currently ongoing there. The sound of artillery and bombing can be heard clearly in Shiqi. Japanese aircraft are using Sanzao Island as a base for operations to invade the hinterland of Hangzhou and are extremely active. Their sound can also be heard in Macau. The previously reported Guilin army that arrived was only a small unit. The main force of reinforcements is still on its way, traveling day and night. The Japanese forces used are mostly puppet troops, so they surrender their weapons to the Chinese army whenever they encounter them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shiqi, May 9] This morning, as the light was beautiful, a Japanese warship suddenly appeared on the Chonggezu River surface at the junction of Zhongshan and Shunde, firing dozens of shots at Dasazhang Township in the third district. At the same time, it used motorboats to carry about 30 Japanese soldiers, trying to land. The team defending that place immediately started shooting, and sent telegrams along the line to coordinate the preparation. Deputy Commander Yuan Ruiting rushed from a certain place to Dazhai after hearing the news, personally directing and supervising the battle. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. The Japanese finally failed and fled back to the ship in a mess, heading towards Ronggui. Now, the coastal area of ​​the third district has been reinforced and is very solid.</p>
<p>[Zhaoqing News] After our army occupied Xinjie on the 6th, a part of the Japanese army, about 2,000 people, sneaked to the vicinity of Zaomu from Shengang and Taipingchang. They were repelled that day. A part of hundreds of people was surrounded by us and almost wiped out. Our army captured seven or eight light and heavy machine guns, more than ten horses, and many other military supplies. On the 7th, another thousand Japanese soldiers came to counterattack. Our army was prepared and failed. They were attacked by our army and fled. Several Japanese soldiers were captured in this battle and are being interrogated. A part of our left wing assault troops captured Fuhe on the 7th and killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers, cutting off the bottom line between Shiqiaoshi and Benpingchang. We also launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops in Jiqiao, Zhucun, Wentouling, and Pingfengling, killing many. The Japanese army also continuously reinforced and used more than a dozen airplanes to assist in the battle. There is fierce fighting now.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, May 9] The Japanese troops on the northwest of Conghua were heavily damaged after many attacks and retreated to Taipingchang on the 8th. There are only alert troops in Shengang now. Our army is attacking Nanhuaizhong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, May 9] According to military news, our army bypassed Haikou to cross the river and launched a pincer attack on Jiujiang on the 7th. The Japanese army suffered a sudden attack and fled to the direction of Fotang Temple. Our army immediately captured Jiujiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan Daily] Our army won the counterattack on the day. The plainclothes teams lurking in the occupied area were extremely active. On the evening of the 7th, there were big fires in Guangzhou and Foshan, burning until dawn. Gunshots rang out, and the Japanese army was extremely panicked. The situation was extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>Junshan in Northern Hunan Recovered</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, May 9] The front-line telegram said that Japanese reinforcements were being sent to Yueyang from the Qingdao naval forces. The number of navy troops is about 2 leagues. It seems they are planning to attack. Our division recaptured Youshan at 4 pm on the 7th. The east, west, and south gates of Yueyang City are controlled by our army. Many Japanese troops are now under the Catholic Church and Yueyang Tower, and dare not come out easily.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, May 9] Junshan in Dongting Lake fell into the hands of the Japanese troops months after Yuezhou last winter. For several months, Japanese warships were seen in the Dongting Lake. Recently, our Hubei guerrillas took advantage of the allied forces attacking Yuezhou, bravely attacked that place under extremely difficult circumstances, and finally captured Junshan at 8 am on the 8th. There was a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops stationed there. The Japanese troops did not expect our surprise attack and were in a mess. More than 100 Japanese troops were killed by us, and the remaining Japanese troops fled to Yuezhou. The residents saw the Qing Dynasty day again and competed to offer items to comfort our army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, May 9] The Japanese troops in Xinyang are extremely terrified after being constantly attacked by our army. They have closed the four city gates and are using the corners of the city to dig traffic trenches to facilitate the retreat. A certain unit of our army has approached the suburbs of Xinyang and is constantly in contact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, May 9] More than 100 Japanese troops in Jiangjunning south of Nanchang were bombarded and defeated by our army with concentrated artillery fire. Many Japanese troops were killed.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Shantou, an Important Port of Import and Export in South China, is on Alert, City is Prospering and Gradually Returning to Its Former Appearance, Transportation and Hotels are Particularly Developed <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Report] Today, no one can deny the importance of Shantou, especially when the Guangdong war has progressed to its current stage. In South China, and even the whole of China, Shantou can be regarded as the only place that can directly interact with the outside world. All the supplies needed in Gan, Yue and Min are currently concentrated in Shantou. Therefore, it can be said that Shantou's position today is a combination of Guangzhou, Xiamen and many other ports that can absorb external assistance. Its importance can be imagined.</p>
<p>In recent days, news of tension in Shantou has been published in various newspapers. It is likely that the Japanese troops will not let go of this only port of import and export. Shantou is an area along the coast, and although defense is more difficult, the military, government, and people have the determination to defend their soil. Moreover, there are mines all over the Shantou port. It is not easy for the Japanese to invade. The reporter came to Shantou from Hong Kong this time, and I had heard the tense news in Shantou in advance. I imagined the situation in Shantou to be quite terrifying, but everything I saw after arriving in Shantou was beyond my imagination. There was no sign of tension in the city, but a sense of calmness was evident everywhere. I thought, could the tense news be just rumors? But it is not. A colleague told me that the Shantou Municipal Government has ordered the citizens to implement forced evacuation starting from April 4. All women and children are included in the evacuation. Also, there are indeed many Japanese warships watching Shantou. It is not a rumor. However, the people of Shantou are used to tension. When the tension comes, it is still the same and there is no different feeling.</p>
<p>The original population of Shantou was more than 200,000. At one time, due to the Japanese planes’ crazy bombing, the wind was frightening. It was reduced to 30,000. Recently, it has gradually returned to its former glory. The population has increased to more than 140,000. All the shops have mostly reopened. The number of merchants doing business in the market is probably more than 90 percent. At night, the lights are bright, and the neon advertising signs are shining on the buildings. Although it is not a scene of prosperity, it can be seen that the prosperity of Shantou has not been affected by the tense atmosphere. Before hearing the sound of gunfire, he always maintained his original song.</p>
<p>My impression of Shantou is that it is a bit like Guangzhou. The city streets are tidy and the buildings are simple. There is nothing injured. Today, Guangzhou is unfortunately lost, and Shantou's position has become more important. We cannot ignore this anymore. On the roads of Shantou, trenches have been built at every strategic point. These are defensive fortifications prepared for street fighting. If the war breaks out in Shantou, every building will become a bunker, demanding a large price from the Japanese. Every building has to report, and it will no longer be as easy to take as Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The mood of the war of resistance filled the entire Shantou. I saw comic strips in the pavilions of Zhongshan Park, denouncing Wang Ni, who advocated peace. I saw many slogans of resistance on the streets. Every pupil who wore revolutionary-colored uniforms seemed to be a small soldier. They are training, preparing to fight for the country's freedom. Also, that group of neat steps of the strong men's team, strides, singing high, this is the expression of public military force, and also the firm expression of war resistance consciousness. I asked many people living in Shantou, if something happens to Shantou, what will you do? I got the same answer, only war, what else? Because if there is a war in Shantou, there is no room for retreat at all. Therefore, if you want to survive, you can only fight.</p>
<p>Shantou has now become an important hub of transportation. At the same time, the government of Guangdong Province and many important agencies are located in Qujiang. Therefore, Shantou and Qujiang have a very close relationship. From Shantou to Chaoan and from Chaoan to Qujiang, passenger and freight are very crowded. The passenger tickets on the Chao-Shao Highway have been sold out a month in advance. It is not easy to catch a ride, because of this relationship, the tourism industry in Shantou and Chaoan is particularly developed, and every hotel is full of waiting passengers.</p>
<p>The reporter suddenly wanted to go to Chaoan. During the few days I stayed in Shantou, no matter how tense the atmosphere was, Shantou still shouldered his responsibilities and maintained his original state. He is deeply imprinted in my mind. (Jun Ren, April 4, in Shantou)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Wuyuan, May 7] (Delayed) Since the Suiyuan Provincial Government moved to a certain place at the beginning of last month, the Suiyuan, a defense line, has shown a lively phenomenon. It is reported that Chairman Fu Zuoyi not only reorganized and refreshed the existing self-defense army, guerrillas, and various troops in western Sui, but also made active progress in politics. First of all, he thoroughly improved the people's livelihood, postponing the land tax and surtax from the 21st to the 26th year, exempting more than ten kinds of taxes, such as business license tax and animal transaction tax. He also called on the people to expand spring ploughing to ensure food production during the war. Secondly, he had detailed plans for organizing the people, training the people, and arming the people, in order to coordinate politics and military affairs, and to unify the people's strength and military strength. At the same time, he also issued a message to the people of western Sui and the whole province, encouraging the people to help the army and jointly fight against the war, the masses to unite and perform their duties, serving the country and the people, not to buy Japanese goods, not to take Japanese goods, not to be Japanese spies, not to serve in the Japanese army, and not to plant opium. At present, Suiyuan has become a tax-free area. The upsurge of expanding spring ploughing and the people's war of resistance has surged in the borderland. The general public is particularly kind to Chairman Fu Zuoyi, who has returned from the war, and is inspired.</p>

They are still engaged in combat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 9th] A few days ago, over four hundred × infantry and cavalry, with multiple cannons attached, set out from Pushang Liyi Song (under the jurisdiction of Jingle) along two routes to invade areas such as Shangxia Bianjing Xiama Town. A portion of our army guarded the mountain peaks, while another portion circled around to attack the rear of the × army. × was heavily surrounded and dared not engage in close combat, immediately fleeing in panic. On the 6th, × again divided into three routes to invade areas before and after Fotang Mountain and Ziji. Our army launched a fierce attack on × from the highlands northeast of Shancun.

<p>— Loyalty and Courage</p>
<p>[Yulin Correspondence] In the rough Northwest, on the plateau, Yulin occupies a strategically important position on the national defense line. It follows the majestic Great Wall and resides in the desert hinterland. The climate is harsh, and the land is mostly barren, known as a remote area.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, it is an important town on one of the nine border defenses. Yulin was established as Shang Commandery during the Qin Dynasty and was conquered by the Xiongnu during the Han Dynasty. Throughout the Wei, Jin, and Northern Dynasties, it lived under the iron heel of foreign tribes. It was not until the Sui and Tang Dynasties that the name Sheng Prefecture appeared. From the late Tang to the late Yuan Dynasties, it belonged to Western Xia. During the Ming Dynasty, people wanted to recover the Hetao region and stationed troops here, building offices and fortifications, which led to an increase in population and the establishment of cultural institutions.</p>
<p>During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, the Hui people and the "Nien rebels" twice fled north to northern Shaanxi, and all counties suffered from the chaos and destruction. Only Yulin, with the joint efforts of the military and civilians, defended itself effectively and was not breached, allowing the people to remain safe.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng rebelled against Yulin, attacking the city gates. All the women and children of the city engaged in street fighting with bricks and stones, repelling him.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, bandit leaders such as Lu Zhan Kui and Chuan Shan Jia have repeatedly attacked the city. The people's temporary armed forces, wielding large swords and axes, went out of the city to meet the bandits. Some made heroic sacrifices, but the bandits were ultimately defeated.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, Yulin has experienced many disasters, but it has sufficient strength to overcome difficulties. This bloody history further proves that the people of Yulin, under the leadership of wise leaders, are capable of fulfilling their arduous tasks in national defense.</p>
<p>The fires of the Lugouqiao Incident awakened the broad masses of the nation and also awakened Yulin.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the sacred war of resistance, the enemy captured Suiyuan and Baotou, and Taiyuan, causing the war in Suiyuan and Mongolia to suddenly become tense. Yulin is closely connected to the front line, bordering Inner Mongolia to the north, connected to Shenfu to the east, controlling Suiyan to the south, and connecting to Ningxia to the west. When the fierce battle on the northern battlefield unfolds, it will immediately become the front line. Its strategic importance in military affairs is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>General Deng ×× has been stationed in Yulin, helping to resolve the most serious disputes in Inner Mongolia, strengthening the determination of the various banners of Inner Mongolia to resist the war, and commanding the local garrison ×× Division, Gao ×× Department, to operate in the areas of Fugou Baode Dongsheng, repeatedly building great achievements, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy's attempt to invade the Northwest. This deserves our敏 and 揚.</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft have been bombing northern Shaanxi wantonly in order to shake people's hearts. The defensive areas of Fugou and Dongsheng have been repeatedly attacked by air. The Dongsheng 入 army once used rifles to shoot down two enemy aircraft, showing their brave and sacrificial fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The military and civilians of Yulin are able to cooperate closely. It is often heard that the army helps the people, and the general public is able to actively participate in patriotic work, generously donating money. For example, the blacksmith Liu Zhanchui destroyed his home to relieve the nation's difficulties, and primary school students saved money to donate.</p>
<p>Recently, they have also responded to the 　　movement. All industries in the city have been mobilized. There are also those who have voluntarily awarded military horses, purchased guns and ammunition, and prepared supplies. Organizations and training for cavalry strike teams, volunteer commando teams, young pioneers, and standing reserve teams are sound and effective. Women and children are also being organized and trained.</p>
<p>These strong soldiers are all prepared to show their skills on the northwestern battlefield, annihilate the enemy, crush the enemy's 　　in the West, and complete our great task of defending the Northwest. (Minge News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Impressions of Yan'an <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Associated Press Reporter Martin, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>Yan'an is only a few miles away from the front line, but this city and the surrounding area are peaceful and uneventful, no different from before the Japanese invaded Shanxi. The two provinces of Shaanxi and Jin are bordered by the Yellow River, which still serves as a barrier that the Japanese cannot easily cross.</p>
<p>If the new recruits and regular troops who are training here day and night were moved elsewhere, or if the large-scale mass gatherings were no longer held, and the trucks transporting military supplies were removed, then a person who happened to travel here would surely believe that this place is a clean land that has not been ravaged by war. But looking back at the town that has been scarred by bombings, the previous feeling would immediately disappear.</p>
<p>Here, farmers, merchants, and workers are all happy to be ruled by the Communists. The land in this special zone has been distributed to the people, the landlords have been eliminated, the farmers' debts have been forgiven, and taxes can be deferred. All of this has brought unexpected prosperity to this barren and impoverished region, and the people are satisfied.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants, especially those who run transportation and hotels, say that the war has brought unexpected prosperity. A straightforward and satisfied car merchant, who has four or five carriages, once told me that his business is three times better than last year, and the carriage rental prices are increasing day by day, allowing him to gain great profits and double the number of his carriages. A hotel owner who heard our conversation also said that his business had increased as well. Hotel owners along the highway from Xi'an to northeastern Shaanxi Province also said that business is booming.</p>
<p>The cost of living here has increased, but according to the Chinese people, the increase is not as significant as in other places. The price of food has increased by 50% to 100% last year, while in various parts of western China, it has increased by three to four times. This place has been under Communist rule for many years, and the local 常偿 is able to be self-sufficient in economics. With only a small amount of external trade, the residents have not felt the pain of war.</p>
<p>This place is mainly an agricultural area, and farmers can produce what they need. There is a lot of cotton grown near the south of the special zone, and there are many sheep in the northern pastures, which can produce wool. Although there are many handicraft factories producing cloth, most of the textile is homemade. There is not much wood, almost only used to build rock caves and mud houses. The main fuel is charcoal, and homemade candles and vegetable oil are used for lighting.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate transactions, the special zone government has issued banknotes to replace various national and provincial currencies, and even copper coins are replaced with banknotes. These banknotes have no cash reserves other than the credit of the special zone government, but everyone in the special zone can use them at face value. There is not much demand for national currency, and the currency of the special zone is not accepted outside the special zone.</p>
<p>The prices of luxury goods are not expensive because Japanese goods sneak in from various places in 翼察熱習. Cigarettes are the most expensive, as they must be imported from the south. The Communists often propagate to the farmers that the cigarettes shipped from outside are all 下了　by the Japanese. Therefore, the most popular "×××" brand has actually been rejected, and replaced by cheaper and inferiorly packaged brands, and even these brands of cigarettes are two or three times more expensive than outside.</p>
<p>The Chinese residents told the city that there are still many barter transactions here, but they are mostly exchanges of products between farmers, rather than purchases and sales between farmers and merchants.</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of the special zone is that there are no thieves, and the people do not look shabby. Beggars have disappeared, and begging behavior is not tolerated in the special zone. All the beggars have fled to the south, or have been employed by the special zone government. Most of the thieves have turned over a new leaf and surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. The people of the special zone used to fight against the Central Army, and in the past two months, they have also fought against the Japanese, so everyone has received some military training. There are no stories of robbery here, but in the nearby south, near Xi'an, it is commonplace.</p>
<p>The special zone government has done its best to alleviate the suffering of the peasants and other residents. As a result, the people love it very much. This feeling of protecting the government cannot be found elsewhere in China. In some other places, the farmers are either afraid of the government or hate the government because of the strong levy of taxes.</p>
<p>If a Chenmin here has a bad harvest one year, the government will help him, and his son will be sent to school and supported by the government. The special zone government also has贈　处. The farmers here love and trust the soldiers 　, which is unprecedented in Chinese history. They call the army "our army" rather than "those armies." The soldiers are trained on how to对　the farmers. They pay the price for what they buy and often associate with the residents.</p>
<p>I once visited an exhibition in Yan'an, which was specifically 　　for the farmers by the special zone government, similar to the American "Village 　 Exhibition." There were exhibitions of the best breeds of livestock and horses, and judged their merits, and all kinds of seeds, fruits, and vegetables were displayed. And there were people 經　on the scene to explain 　 planting, irrigation, and new farming methods. Also displays the 　 of textile and leather. Products, and describes the method of manufacture. All this is the government, 　 for the farmers, daily attendance, the farmers who watched were in the thousands, the special zone exhibition simply put a week off.</p>
<p>Politically speaking, this special zone is also the most progressive place in the whole of China. Not only do the people have their elected representatives in the special zone meetings, but also the county councils or village committees are operated by them through popular elections. Ten thousand people in the special zone say "our government" instead of "that government". There are no rickshaw pullers and porters in the district, and there are very few舌force who carry luggage. The peasants are very respectful of government officials. Even Mao Zedong, the "Chinese Lenin," will not 　 avoid them, and the peasants are always willing to run errands. All government officials wear the same plain blue cotton uniforms, eat no better than the peasants, and live no better than a middle-class merchant. All of these facts are the reasons why people love and cut off the special zone government.</p>
<p>Japan has often declared that this invasion of China is a bloody battle to 　 remove the threat of communism in the Far East. The Communists, however, have been able to take advantage of the Japanese lies to宣　 to the peasants. 記　 once went to a small village forty miles outside of Yan'an to attend a tea party, and the reporter was able to inquire about each farmer. The leader of the tea 　 Association was a farmer with a full face of the wind 　, and 有　　:</p>
<p>一　Japanese, enough to see the government that the Communist Party has done for us, they will not want to fight us anymore. We are very safe, because the Communist Party has helped us. The Japanese rulers 　　like our leaders are so good, the Japanese will be much better, but 　 them do not want to 　 decide communism, they want China, one</p>
<p>Japanese propaganda is what the West calls "self-made and self-developed" propaganda. (April 1)</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Florina, Greece, 9th] King Zog of Albania, in view of the Italian army's invasion of Tirana and the destruction of the fortifications, fled Albania yesterday. After leading his troops and militias to fiercely resist the enemy on the front line in Durazzo, the Albanian King left the capital the night before. He hopes to seek assistance from the great powers abroad to guide his people in guerrilla warfare. Before the Albanian King arrived here, the Queen had appealed to the world for assistance to her invaded country. It is heard that the Albanian King himself rejected the Italian proposal yesterday, which required the Albanian King to surrender and Italy to保　 his throne. The Albanian King's grandmother asked the Associated Press to convey to the world yesterday that all countries in the world should assist Albania and that the Albanian people will be able to resist to the end. The Albanian King arrived here yesterday afternoon, accompanied by 45 people, traveling in 16 cars and two trucks, looking exhausted. He immediately met with the Queen and the Crown Prince, with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy.</p>
<p>[Haitong This, Athens, 9th] The King of Albania arrived in Florina in northern Greece yesterday, accompanied by Albanian ministers and the King's attendants. The King is reunited with the Queen and Crown Prince here.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The "Anqi Thames Times" foreign affairs correspondent declared that London now believes that Italy's forceful occupation of Albania has caused the European situation to change suddenly. The most serious consequence is that it 令意國令譽 has been greatly affected. The question is whether the British government will 音布 　止 this 　 agreement on the grounds that Italy has broken the Anglo-Italian恊. It is rather勉強 for Britain to take this step. The more urgent fact now is how to maintain the independence of Greece and Turkey. The two countries, Greece and Turkey, have felt extremely great disturbance due to Italy's forceful occupation of Albania and the concentration of Italian troops on Rhodes and other islands of the Dodecanese. The correspondent also stated that the responsible authorities in London believe that if Greece is attacked, Britain will provide assistance. The final decision on this point may be made at a future 　内　conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 9th] In view of the fact that the totalitarian country has a further attempt to invade the Balkans and may affect the British communication line with India and other territories, the British cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, urged by the four ministers of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Defense. A total of eleven people participated. It is heard that the four ministers of the British Navy, Army, Air Force, and Defense all advocate that Britain should immediately issue a public statement expressing that Britain is determined to fight for the sake of maintaining the independence of Greece and Turkey. This move must wait for Chamberlain to return and convene a Lingti cabinet meeting before a decision can be made. In view of the serious situation in Europe, Mr. Zhang has decided to suspend his vacation and 　 return to London early this morning. He is scheduled to consult with his cabinet colleagues on everything today. Today is Easter Sunday, and it is rare for the British cabinet to hold a meeting on this day.</p>
<p>The British Labour Party will ask for a convocation of Parliament after the Cabinet discusses the occupation of Albania by Italian troops and the movement of German troops.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Cabinet ministers convened at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the situation arising from Italy's invasion of Albania. Prime Minister Chamberlain was absent, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon acting as chairman. Foreign Secretary Halifax and the various defense ministers were in attendance. Halifax first reported on all developments within Albania over the past 24 hours. During the discussions, opposition leader Attlee personally went to Downing Street, requesting the reconvening of the House of Commons to discuss the Albanian invasion. The Liberal opposition also telegraphed Chamberlain, making the same request.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 8th] Following the conclusion of the British cabinet meeting, a public statement was issued, roughly stating, "While some information has been received, the complete truth of the situation remains unclear. The government remains in the dark and uninformed on numerous issues." Ministers will temporarily remain in or near the capital, but the date of the next cabinet meeting has not yet been decided. Chamberlain will decide whether to convene Parliament, but the Prime Minister has not yet considered the opposition's requests.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Albanian Ambassador to Britain last night. Also present were the French Ambassador and the leader of the British opposition, Attlee. The purpose of the Foreign Secretary's discussion with Attlee was the immediate reconvening of Parliament.

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Diplomatic correspondents for Sunday newspapers claim that the cabinet must decide on Sunday whether to guarantee Greece against unwarranted aggression. One report claims that if Britain guarantees Greece, it may occupy Corfu as a demonstration of Greece's "trust" in Britain.</p>
<p>[Haitong Press, London, 9th] According to reliable sources, the British government intends to announce a guarantee of Greek independence and sovereignty within days. The Greek Ambassador to Britain notified the British government of Greece's desire for this guarantee at the initial stage of the Albanian crisis. According to well-informed British sources, Chamberlain's sudden end to his vacation and return to London was the result of Saturday's meetings. It is said that the Foreign Secretary and Defense Minister both believed that since Italy had invaded Albania, Britain needed to guarantee Greece and request Chamberlain's immediate return to London. The cabinet will meet tomorrow, and a guarantee of Greek security may be announced after the meeting, while Parliament will convene on Tuesday. According to well-informed sources, the rumours circulating that the British Navy had occupied the Greek island of Corfu are unfounded, and the British government never had such a plan. Initially, there were concerns that the Italian Navy might take such action, but the government believes that a British guarantee of Greece would be sufficient to prevent such an Italian move.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, 9th] Hull's statement condemning Italy has been endorsed by President Roosevelt.

However, official discussions are still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today condemning Italy's armed occupation of Albania. Without elaborating, he stated that he believed Italy had violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

Hull also indicated that a ban on arms exports to Italy is being discussed under the Neutrality Act, but has not yet been formally considered in detail.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, Today] President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull strongly condemned Italy's invasion of Albania, stating that it threatened world peace. The content of the American condemnation of Italy's invasion of Albania is roughly as follows: "The armed occupation of Albania undoubtedly threatens world peace. We would be short-sighted if we did not pay attention to this new development. Any action that threatens world peace will impact and run counter to the will of mankind, as all governments want to lead their people into a peaceful and happy environment and away from the evils of war. The unfortunate and unavoidable negative impact of this event is self-evident, but if such unfortunate events continue to occur, human confidence will be shattered, economic stability will be affected, and the happiness of all nations will be struck."</p>
<p>When asked if the US considered Italy's invasion of Albania a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Hull avoided giving a direct answer. However, Hull's attitude and the implications of his words implied this.</p>
<p>In responding to inquiries from various parties, Hull placed particular emphasis on the phrase "use of force to invade" in the statement condemning Italy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, news from Paris reports that four Soviet destroyers have sailed through the Dardanelles Strait and entered the Eastern Mediterranean.

<p>Soviet Commentary</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The Soviet government newspaper, Izvestia, published an article criticizing Italy's invasion of Albania, stating, "Leaders of the Rome-Berlin Axis are alarmed by the active British diplomacy that specifically lobbied Yugoslavia to prevent its participation in international guarantees. The Albanian incident shows that if attempts to prevent aggression are limited to a specific area, aggressive warfare will break out elsewhere. Establishing genuine collective security based on the principle of the indivisibility of peace is the only way to deter aggressors. Otherwise, all other actions are merely window dressing and insufficient to establish security between nations."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Military officials here believe that Germany will soon invade Danzig and the Polish Corridor. They believe that the invasion may begin before April 15, so the crisis of a European war is imminent. They believe that German forces will invade Danzig and Poland as a matter of time.

<p>[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, 8th] According to sources close to the President, the United States, in view of the endless aggression of certain countries, is increasingly feeling the need to change its economic policy; otherwise, the US will gradually lose its commerce and navigation rights throughout the world. To cope with the current situation, Roosevelt is currently considering the following measures: (1) Implementing a large-scale increase in taxes on imported goods to achieve American self-sufficiency; (2) Reducing the American standard of living to compete with totalitarian states; (3) Subsidizing US exports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hot Springs, USA, 8th] A key figure, who can generally represent the views of the White House, made a speech regarding the situation caused by the Albanian crisis. He stated, roughly, that the second phase of military aggression in Europe is affecting American security. Moreover, the aggressor nations are forcing the invaded nations to accept bartering, which is worsening world trade. The United States will also feel the effects. President Roosevelt, recognizing this, may choose one of the following three options:</p>
<p>(1) Build a "Great Wall" around the United States in terms of commerce and achieve economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Lower the domestic standard of living, reduce wages, and increase working hours to compete with countries that are promoting bartering, so that they can compete in the world commercial market.</p>
<p>(3) Subsidize the nation's export industry in a systematic way. In short, this stage of the international situation may impact the industrial, agricultural, and labor sectors of the United States. The government should clearly inform the nation so that everyone is aware.</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Crisis of Hong Kong's Weaving Industry <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's weaving industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, with its products mainly sold to British territories and raw materials mostly imported from China. However, it is currently facing two major crises. First, in terms of sales, because the UK is implementing revised preferential tariff rules and tariffs on cotton and rayon products, the amount of Hong Kong cotton cloth exported to the UK has greatly decreased this year. Second, there is the issue of raw materials. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese factories have been using Bombay cotton yarn. However, recently, this industry has been booming, and the supply of Bombay cotton yarn cannot meet the demand, leading to rising prices. After Shanghai fell, the source of domestically produced cotton yarn was cut off, so the amount of imported domestic cotton yarn has increased sharply again.</p>
<p>The first problem affects not only weaving operators, but also the loss of jobs for dozens of workers. In fact, since the outbreak of the war, the need for uniforms for our soldiers and medicinal cotton cloth has increased sharply, and will certainly continue to increase in the future. If this industry can do its best, plan for the future of the motherland and its people, it seems that it should immediately consider developing the domestic weaving industry and then producing for the current needs of the motherland. But this will involve the issue of raw materials. In fact, the southwestern provinces of our country have many places suitable for growing cotton, and the recent international situation is increasingly favorable to us. China, Britain and France are cooperating closely, and it would be extremely convenient to set up yarn spinning factories in the southwest. Although the above sounds as if it cannot be helped immediately, it is indeed a fundamental plan. We hope that patriotic manufacturers will think deeply, and that all of you who will be attending the production meeting will have a plan.</p>
<p>In addition, Hong Kong has no shortage of specialized weaving talent, and there are many displaced people in the war zone. At a time when the country is in dire need of people, the relevant government agencies should have appropriate measures to enable them to serve the country. This type of talent should also be encouraged to fight for the country and find ways to return to the country and contribute.</p>

<p>The British government has intensified military preparations for its overseas territories in recent years. The increase in Hong Kong's annual military expenditure, the increase in the number of volunteers, the strengthening of defense fortifications, and the expansion of the air force all prove that the Hong Kong authorities have made sufficient preparations for wartime. Furthermore, due to Hong Kong's dense population and closely packed buildings, which would be easy targets for air raids, resulting in astonishing losses of life and property, the authorities established the Air Defense Committee years ago, appointing Mr. Spear as the commissioner responsible for planning various air defense matters. The progress of the work has gradually improved. The Air Defense Committee believes that in order for air defense work to be effective, it must have the cooperation of the community. Therefore, in recent years, it has been doing its best to impart air defense knowledge and establish air defense training classes to train air defense instructors. Blackout drills have been held several times, but the results have not been deemed satisfactory because the general public does not have a correct understanding of the importance of thorough cooperation with the air defense authorities. The alarm broadcast machines have proven to be insufficient in distribution after several blackout drills. Six new machines have been purchased from the UK and placed in central locations. The air defense authorities have decided to hold another blackout drill at the end of this month. The nature of this blackout drill, whether it will be an emergency or a gradual one, has not yet been decided. In the central district of Hong Kong, alarm broadcast machines have been installed on the roofs of the Gloucester Building and the Sheung Wan Market. In addition to the alarms broadcast by the alarm machines, alarm messages will also be rebroadcast by the broadcasting station. The air defense authorities express their hope that the community will cooperate so that this blackout drill can achieve satisfactory results as a reference. As for the commercial sector's views on blackout drills, they believe that the previous drills were held too early, affecting business and causing losses in revenue. They hope that the authorities will understand the difficulties of businesses and decide to start the drill after 9:00 PM, so as not to cause losses to business, and if the timing is chosen appropriately, there may be good results. According to an investigation by reporters, the locations of air raid shelters in various districts have been selected. This blackout drill should make full use of the designated air raid shelters. The responsible personnel should direct pedestrians on the road to evacuate according to the indicated locations, so that residents can have orderly training in avoiding bombs, so as not to be at a loss when something happens, which will be of great help to the air defense command personnel.</p>

<p>Recently, piracy and banditry have been rampant, causing trouble for travelers without any signs of abating. Yesterday, another cargo boat was robbed by six pirates in the waters near Black Point in British territory. The losses were quite significant. According to the boat owner, who only returned to port yesterday to report the incident to the Ping Shan Police Station in the New Territories, his boat, numbered T-136H, was hired by a client on the 8th of this month. At 2 PM that afternoon, fully loaded with goods, it set sail from Castle Peak, Tuen Mun towards Wan Keng Sha. Unexpectedly, when sailing back to the Black Point waters in British territory, a small boat suddenly approached head-on. The boat had about six pirates, all armed with guns of various lengths. As the pirate boat approached, four pirates swarmed onto Zheng's boat. The pirates first threatened everyone, then tied up the five people on board one by one with thin ropes, pushing them into the hold. Then they began searching and looting separately for about two hours. Later, a large boat approached head-on, and the victims initially thought it was a rescue, but it turned out to be another group of pirates. The pirates transferred all the items from the boat to the large cargo boat and sailed away towards the Chinese territory. The looted items included 387 cans of kerosene, 23 bolts of piece goods, 25 catties of salted fish, and six dozen batteries, among other things. After receiving the report, the police station filed the case, temporarily detaining Zheng and others for investigation.</p>

<p>The firewood shortage in Hong Kong has been gradually resolved in the past month due to the continuous arrival of firewood from various places. Recently, more than ten ships travel between Haikou and Guangzhouwan, each bringing large quantities of firewood. At the same time, seven or eight ships sailing between Chaozhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other ports also bring firewood, with almost every ship carrying it. Firewood also arrives continuously from Singapore. Moreover, before the war in Jiangmen, Macao supplied no less than a thousand piculs of firewood daily. Unexpectedly, firewood prices have suddenly risen again in recent days. According to reporters' investigations, this is due to firewood merchants seizing the opportunity presented by the Jiangmen war to manipulate prices. Yesterday morning, a certain ship from Guangzhouwan brought a large quantity of firewood, mooring at the coast. The retail price was 74 catties per dollar.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Bombay Cotton Yarn Prices Soar, Hong Kong Cotton Textile Costs Greatly Affected; British Territories Sales Retreat, Spring Orders Decrease by Two-Thirds; Small Manufacturers Seek Other Markets, Many Turn to Purchasing Foreign Yarn <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The cotton fabric weaving industry in Hong Kong has flourished like bamboo shoots after rain, and its sales market is mainly in British territories. In the past, due to the absence of war between China and Japan and the unchanged British preferential tariffs, manufacturers often used foreign cotton yarn to reduce costs. At that time, the British preferential tariff regulations stipulated that any product, regardless of its origin, that added British territory raw materials or labor value of 25% of the original value could enjoy preferential tariffs. However, since July 1937, after the British revised the preferential tariff regulations and implemented cotton and rayon textile tariffs, it was stipulated that only cotton products whose raw materials and labor were entirely from British territory could enjoy British preferential tariff benefits.</p>
<p>To prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage, strict measures were taken to prevent the mixing of other countries' raw materials to impersonate British territory products. It was stipulated that the cotton yarn used must be clearly verified by government-approved auditors to prove that it was indeed British yarn before the Hong Kong import and export department could issue preferential tariff certificates. Therefore, in order to enjoy this preferential tariff benefit, manufacturers have switched to using British raw materials. For fabrics not destined for sale in British territories, which do not have the right to enjoy preferential tariffs, many still use Shanghai cotton yarn and foreign cotton yarn. As a result, there was a temporary situation of demand exceeding supply in British India, and prices also rose sharply, significantly impacting fabric costs. According to cotton fabric manufacturers, the quantity of Hong Kong cotton fabric exported to British territories last year has greatly decreased compared to the past. Traditionally, a large number of spring orders are placed in the spring season, but this year's orders are only between 20% and 30% compared to the same period last year. Among them, a few larger manufacturers have retail departments in Hong Kong. Recently, patriotic people are known to promote domestic goods, so although exports have sharply decreased, retail sales can still support them. As for other smaller manufacturers, due to decreased demand in British territories, they have had to seek other markets. However, other markets, not being British territories, do not have the protection of preferential tariff regulations. If they use more expensive cotton yarn, their costs will increase accordingly, and higher prices will inevitably discourage orders. Therefore, they have had to turn to using cheaper yarn. However, since the fall of Shanghai, our country's yarn supply has been cut off, and the only cotton yarn cheaper than Bombay yarn is foreign cotton yarn. Judging from recent import statistics from the export department, the quantity of foreign yarn arriving in Hong Kong has recently increased.</p>

<p>Due to the disrupted route between Guangzhou and Hong Kong due to the war in South China, shipping between Hong Kong and Macao has become increasingly developed. Recently, the Italian merchant ship "Roma" has joined as the only Italian ship sailing to South China ports. It is scheduled to sail to Macao this afternoon for its first voyage. The ship has a capacity of 146 tons and a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour. It was completed in Shanghai five years ago and later sailed on the Xiamen-Zhangzhou route. After Xiamen fell, it changed to sailing between Hong Kong and Shantou. After a typhoon in September of the year before last, the ship's owner, Fanesdor, sold it in Hong Kong. After the change of ownership, the current owner is Miltalen. The ship has a Chinese crew of 15, including the captain and mechanical engineer. Its passenger capacity is set at 300, but passenger passports have not yet been obtained. Currently, it can only carry cargo. In the short term, the ship may sail between Guangdong and Macao. This can be implemented once negotiations are completed with the Macao authorities and Chinese military authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e42">A Soldier of the New China - General Lin Shu Scathingly Criticizes Wang Jingwei's "Examples" <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>A Speech Enthusiastically Endorsed by the Entire Audience</p>
<p>General Lin Shu is a brave active-duty soldier. He was already a strong soldier when the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he fought in the Fifth War Zone, facing death and danger in the hail of bullets, and his achievements were particularly outstanding. Later, he was injured in battle and returned to Guangxi for treatment. After recovering slightly, he was appointed as the commander of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army, responsible for training the student army. Recently, he was ordered by the authorities to accompany the China National Salvation Drama Troupe to foreign countries to comfort overseas Chinese. When he arrived in Hong Kong, he was warmly welcomed by various groups here, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, at a welcome meeting by patriotic overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, his rebuttal of Wang Jingwei's "Give an Example," was particularly pertinent and insightful. The entire audience, tightly packed, applauded enthusiastically, praising him as the soul of the new China, speaking for the descendants of the Chinese nation who are unwilling to be slaves of a fallen country. After the meeting, many friends urged the reporter to publish General Lin's speech in order to deepen the understanding of those with "nearsightedness" and not be misled by the sinister schemes of foreign and traitorous elements. Here, the reporter is pleased to report Mr. Lin's speech to our beloved overseas Chinese as follows. First, Mr. Lin said:</p>
<p>Today, I originally wanted to talk to you about military matters. However, because I have seen Wang Jingwei's several essays published in the Japanese newspaper these days, I cannot suppress the agitation in the emotions of a soldier. Therefore, I will first talk about Wang's "Give an Example," raising a few points to question it, to see how ridiculous Wang's proposition is.</p>
<p>First, in that article, Wang Jingwei begins by lamenting the death of Zeng Zhongming, saying that Zeng died for national affairs. When he was dying, he still said that with Mr. Wang taking care of national affairs and his wife taking care of family matters, he had nothing to worry about. It seems that Zeng still cared about national affairs even when he was dying. But I ask: Did Zeng's death really die for national affairs? Since the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers, in order to complete the task of defending the country, have fought bravely under any difficult circumstances and made heroic sacrifices. Millions of compatriots have suffered from the trampling and destruction of the Japanese, displaced and died. Has Wang not seen these spirits and deeds of regarding death as home and enduring pain to sacrifice? And Zeng Zhongming, who has received the cultivation of the country, did not think of doing his best to repay the central government at this time of national hardship, but fled to live abroad. [redacted - slanderous statements about Wang Jingwei and Zeng Zhongming]... Yet Wang shamelessly said that he died for national affairs. Then I ask, what are the sacrifices of these thousands of soldiers and civilians for? And what did they die for? Therefore, Wang's words should be changed to "Zeng Zhongming died for the affairs of the Japanese!" Zeng Zhongming's words should be, "I serve the Japanese!" to conform to the facts.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter hating the Japanese broke through the solemn atmosphere. Afterwards, everyone quietly listened to Mr. Lin saying:</p>
<p>Second, Wang said: Since I published the Yan telegram, the people of the country have focused on peace, and it is my proposition. In fact, the proposal for peace was decided after a joint discussion by the highest organs. So he cited the record of the Supreme National Defense Conference held at the Central Bank in Hankou on December 6, 1937, as an example. But upon closer inspection, the chairman of the meeting was Wang Jingwei, and the secretary was precisely Zeng Zhongming. This document, prepared by them single-handedly, is now being released by them, and there are many suspicious points in it. And if Wang Jingwei's example is true, then it is nothing more than Wang's own confession of deceiving comrades and surrendering to the Japanese while he was chairman and Zeng was taking notes. The article also mentions that when Chairman Chiang met with German Ambassador Trautmann, he said: "In the midst of such an urgent war, it is impossible to mediate and negotiate. I hope Germany will notify Japan to stop the war first." This is the Chairman's conversation with a third-country envoy, and it clearly shows the Chairman's determination to firmly resist the Japanese until they withdraw from Chinese territory and not allow peace negotiations. With such a firm statement, how can Wang say that "peace" is a jointly discussed and decided proposition? Where did this come from? This is Wang's self-contradiction, slapping himself in the face. And when Trautmann went to Nanjing to see the Chairman, Wang said that he had first reported to the Chairman through him. If "peace" is to be discussed jointly by the highest organs, why did Wang need to be so impatient? And why is Wang always involved in matters of peace? What is this blood relationship?</p>
<p>Wang also said that he could not publish the Yan telegram if he did not leave Chongqing, which is even more absurd. Is there any reason why one cannot express a proposition decided after joint discussion by the highest organs in one's own country? And Wang said that "there are thousands of evidences for peace." According to him, the central government has many people who advocate peace. If there are so many comrades, they can discuss it jointly in the country. Why did he have to flee abroad to spout nonsense? And when Zeng Zhongming was dying, he only entrusted the responsibility of advocating peace to Wang Jingwei alone? Why does Wang Jingwei himself say: "There are those who agree with me on national affairs," but not mention that there is anyone else in the central government? - Mr. Lin became more and more indignant as he spoke, and the listeners were more and more moved.</p>
<p>Third, Wang agreed with Konoe's statement, believing that it could serve as the basis for negotiations. Now let's examine the content of Konoe's statement! What Konoe said can be roughly divided into four points: (1) No territorial demands on China and respect for Chinese sovereignty; (2) Combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, economic cooperation; (3) Joint anti-communism, stationing troops in Inner Mongolia; (4) Allowing Japanese troops to be stationed and live freely in inland China. Are these not the conditions for the fall of the country? Since there are no territorial demands, why mention the combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo? Are the four northeastern provinces not Chinese territory? Did Wang Jingwei actually agree to this? Since Chinese sovereignty is respected, why can troops be stationed in the interior? Does this not constitute a destruction of the unification of China's administrative sovereignty? Did Wang Jingwei actually acknowledge this? Since troops are stationed in Inner Mongolia, why did Wang Jingwei's Yan telegram say that it would not affect Sino-Soviet relations? Is this treating the Chinese people as three-foot children? These contradictions that even Konoe himself cannot explain, Wang Jingwei insists on covering up, is this not evidence of collusion with the Japanese? - A second round of warm applause.</p>
<p>Fourth, Wang put forward two reasons for advocating peace: (1) When Trautmann was mediating, Nanjing had not yet fallen. Now, after Nanjing, even important cities such as Xuzhou, Jinan, Kaifeng, Anqing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Wuhan have been lost. The situation has deteriorated a hundredfold. Why was peace possible then, but not now? (2) When Trautmann was mediating, the terms proposed by the Japanese were even more harsh than Konoe's statement. Why could it be used as a basis for negotiations then, but not now? This is another fallacy. Regardless of whether the Trautmann mediation case is true or not, let's assume it is; even if we take a step back and say it is true, it should be understood that it was a matter of years ago. Since the time is different, we have already made leaps and bounds in strategy and tactics, reaching the stage where we can defeat and eliminate the Japanese. This is the first change. Although we have lost many important cities, the overall strategy does not lie in the contention of points and lines, but in the occupation of area. Now, in the occupied areas, in addition to being able to control some transportation lines, the rest of the place, China's regime, still exists, and the government's laws are still communicated. Moreover, in addition to the strong regular army stopping the Japanese from advancing on the front, there are also a large number of field armies and vast guerrillas active behind them. This is the application of the overall strategy, which is also the guarantee of military victory. Wang Jingwei, as a senior national official, does he not understand the country's strategy and tactics, and can he not see any signs of brilliance? He deliberately spreads these absurd defeatist arguments, in fact, to eliminate the will of the people to resist the war and help the Japanese in their attack on us! - The listeners expressed infinite regret for Wang Jingwei's incomplete "cleverness!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin continued: Japan has always had two policies. In addition to the continental policy that everyone already knows, its maritime policy is based on the United States and Britain as imaginary enemies. It has also laid out three lines of defense at sea. If the second and third lines of defense cannot be defended one day, it is prepared to retreat to the third line of defense. Where is the third line of defense? It is in our four northeastern provinces. Therefore, whether it is the continental policy or the maritime policy, the four northeastern provinces are Japan's lifeline. Wang Jingwei is a senior official with heavy responsibility. How could he not know the Japanese military plan, but still agree to Konoe's statement, considering the puppet Manchukuo as a legitimate organization and recognizing its existence? Is this planning for the Japanese? Or is it so confused that he is unaware of human affairs?</p>
<p>Fifth, from this, we know that there is a problem with Wang's personality. [redacted - accusatory questions about Wang Jingwei's character] How could he have the heart to say these words? We know that during the Anti-Japanese War, how many strong men who enlisted in the war had parents who died or were ill at home and wanted to go back to see them, but had no time; how many women serving in the war zone had children who died or were ill at home and wanted to go back to see them, but had no time; many officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines missed their elderly parents and wanted to write a letter to comfort them, but had no time. Why did this happen? In order to strive for the survival of the country, in order to strive for the liberation of the nation, this is such a moving thing - now Wang actually says in "Give an Example" that as long as my proposition is adopted, personal matters are not a problem: what does this mean! Of course, if the proposition of peace is adopted, he must be invited to come out. At that time, Wang can take the stage to become a high official. But what if the central government does not adopt his proposition? Then he continues to say that if the situation continues to be deadlocked, even if I leave the country, I will come back, to where, Nanjing, Beiping, Guangzhou, that is where he is going, his personal problems are solved in that way.</p>
<p>What is particularly infuriating is that [redacted - condemnatory statement regarding Wang Jingwei's attitude towards soldiers] This is an insult to the entire Chinese military. I believe that Wang would not dare to say this to the Chinese soldiers, and the people of China will definitely be enraged to sanction it." [redacted - further condemnation of Wang Jingwei]</p>
<p>I am very angry today, and I have expressed my feelings directly. I hope everyone will pay attention to this issue and expose the true face behind this conspiracy.</p>
<p>- A warm and prolonged applause ended the generous presentation of the soul of a soldier of the new China, and everyone stepped forward to shake hands with Mr. Lin to pay tribute.</p>

<p>Recently, incidents of robbery and looting have occurred frequently in various parts of the Kowloon Peninsula, greatly affecting the protection of the lives and property of ordinary residents. The authorities have decided to take various effective steps and strictly order police detectives in each district to carry out the suppression of thugs. After receiving the order, police detectives in each district immediately began investigating opium dens, gambling houses, and lower-level places such as buildings and boats, hoping to arrest those who are hiding among them and committing evil deeds, and to deport them from the country if necessary. Special attention is paid to the so-called "Triad" and other lower-level figures, because [they] have always been the main perpetrators in robbery and kidnapping cases, colluding with each other to commit various illegal activities. In the purification of undesirable elements, the Triad figures cannot be ignored in the slightest. It is estimated that in recent days, police detectives in the Kowloon Peninsula have begun a major roundup of Triad figures. A certain Feng, a well-known leader, was arrested in Yau Ma Tei yesterday and detained for strict investigation. Two or thirty other unemployed vagrants belonging to this category have been arrested before and after, all of whom are detained for investigation. Those who do not have any evidence to prove that they are law-abiding residents will be deported from the country by the police in accordance with emergency ordinances. In recent years, new buildings have been added in Kowloon City, the population has suddenly become dense, and the activities of Triad figures in the area have become increasingly rampant. The secret societies of the major Triads have almost all moved to Kowloon City. The police detectives have also been ordered to pay special attention.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I was deeply surprised to read the article "Hong Kong Government's Wenchang Association Prepares to Perform 'Phoenix City' to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief" in the Hong Kong news section of the Qing Bao on the fourth of this month. The association's disaster relief is already being handled by the Charity Department. The drama group's drama practice is a pastime for colleagues in their spare time and has not been used to raise funds through performances. I am deeply afraid that this will confuse the audience, so I have sent this letter to sell, hoping that you will correct it. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>— Huo Xi</p>
<p>Drama Workers' Congress Sees United Welcome from Hong Kong and Kowloon Drama Troupes to the China Salvation Drama Troupe</p>
<p>The China Salvation Drama Troupe is like a spark—a spring breeze—the wind of the times—blowing it to any place, and that place immediately bursts into flames. It is also like a new seedling, sown in any place, and that place immediately sprouts and grows with new life. These young partners are indeed lovely and admirable, and the times that nurtured their growth are also great enough to be celebrated. The China Salvation Drama Troupe, carrying a strong scent of gunpowder, came from the front lines to comfort overseas compatriots, and their arrival in Hong Kong was warmly welcomed by various local groups, which was deeply moving. Although this newspaper has already published several special articles reporting on it, the wave of welcome continues to rise, and each welcome meeting has its own wonderful highlights. Therefore, we report, continue to report, and report again. We believe that this is also a meaningful, necessary, and important matter that should be strengthened. Because Hong Kong's "spring" is too suffocating, and breaking the suffocating atmosphere is a life-saving request!</p>
<p>Yesterday, patriotic overseas compatriots in Hong Kong held two grand welcome meetings. At 9:30 a.m., the Amateur Fraternity Society held a welcome at their society. The fourth floor, although not small, was tightly packed with a large group of young working people who were overseas but had their hearts in the country. Many people were forced to climb onto nearby tables and stools to watch, just so they wouldn't miss this opportunity to absorb spiritual nourishment and strengthen their understanding.</p>
<p>The most enthusiastic and moving was the joint welcome meeting initiated by the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association and various youth drama troupes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was held at 7 p.m. last night in the grand auditorium of South China Middle School in Kowloon. Attendees included representatives from the Red and White Drama Troupe, Lu Feng Drama Society, Iron Current Drama Troupe, New Voice Drama Society, Whirlwind Drama Society, Tough Door Drama Troupe, China Drama Society, Youth Troupe, Vanguard Children's Drama Troupe, Fourth Women's Federation Training Class, Youth Amusement Society, Learning Virtue and Aspiration Society, Red and Blue Drama Troupe, Ding Chou Drama Troupe, Ant Children's Drama Troupe, Angry Wave Drama Troupe, Guang Da Drama Society, Self-Improvement Sports Society, and other drama troupes, totaling more than 200 people, all of whom are workers dedicated to the drama movement. This was truly an unprecedented and most meaningful gathering of drama workers.</p>
<p>All members of the China Salvation Drama Troupe attended. Upon their arrival, more than 200 drama workers stood up and warmly applauded their welcome. After taking their seats, Mr. Wei Baishui first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Lu Fu, who gave a brief introduction to the troupe's past work, kicking off the prelude to friendship and discussion.</p>
<p>Amid a burst of enthusiastic applause, the head of the troupe, Mr. Jin Shan, stood up and reported in detail on their experiences and valuable lessons learned in the salvation drama movement over the past year. "The future of China's emerging drama, and its brilliant future, is entirely entrusted to the thousands upon thousands of young people who are struggling hard on the front lines and in the war zones." As he spoke, it was as if he was digging out his heart and speaking his innermost thoughts. He was too excited, and everyone was deeply moved by him.</p>
<p>Next, he put forward several of the most valuable suggestions and hopes to the drama comrades in Hong Kong… (1) Have a high degree of enthusiasm, (2) Have a correct political understanding, (3) Life should be serious and popular, (4) The content of the drama should be relevant to reality, (5) Drama workers should unite greatly.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the troupe, reported on the troupe's service experience. The most impressive thing was: "Some people say that we are educating soldiers and awakening the masses, and that our contribution is great. In fact, it is the soldiers and the masses who awaken us and educate us. We see the positive side of China, thoroughly recognize the greatness of China, and the unlimited hope for the future. We realize that the life of a movie star and the life of a university student are not something that can be followed, and must be abandoned. Therefore, we work and learn, not only do we not think it is hard, but we deeply celebrate this happiness, this is true progress. This kind of progress cannot be obtained in university or studying abroad."</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Fu reported on many current situations of the War of Resistance that are not usually heard, which made our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance even more determined. Next, the old educator Fang Yuyan and the troupe's young soldier Fan Zheng both gave moving speeches, which was truly a practice of all-out resistance, with no distinction between men, women, old, and young. The unity of Mandarin, Cantonese, and various local dialects in one hall was also a symbol of no distinction between north, south, east, and west. Finally, everyone freely expressed their opinions on the salvation drama movement, sparking a lively discussion, with talking and laughing, as well as tea and snacks, tense but also lively and harmonious. It was not until around 11 p.m. that everyone reluctantly said goodbye, agreeing to meet again in their work. (Note: Due to the time of publication, the discussion on the salvation drama movement could not be recorded in detail. Please refer to the next issue of this newspaper's film and drama weekly.)</p>

<h3 id="e47">After the Launch of the Guangdong General Counter-Offensive, the Southern Route Follows the Northern Route in a Major Expansion; Our Army Achieves a Great Victory at Jiangcun, with the Vanguard Gradually Approaching the Suburbs; Intensified Defenses Along the Liuhua Bridge Area in the Northwest Suburbs; Thousands of People in Northern Huaxian Are Caught in a Fierce Struggle <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Northern Guangdong Express News] Since our Guangdong Provincial Army launched a full-scale general counter-offensive on the 6th, it has adopted a lightning-fast approach, with all routes launching a full-scale attack on the enemy, achieving a huge victory unseen in the past half year. The progress of the northern route is particularly astonishing. Since successively recovering important strongholds such as Xinzhi and Shijiao, it continued to advance south on the 7th and 8th, directly approaching Guangzhou along the railway and highway. In order to preserve Guangdong, the enemy intends to transfer remnants from various lines to reinforce northern Guangdong in an attempt to make a final stand. Now, our various armies are advancing simultaneously, and the overall situation in Guangdong is showing signs of wavering, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The following is a record of the military situation on the northern route in the past two days.</p>
<p>Our Army Overruns Jiangcun and Heads Straight for Guangzhou</p>
<p>On the southern section of the Ao Route, the front lines of our army, after recovering Xin'jie on the 6th, had their vanguard unit rush into Jiangcun on the evening of the 6th, killing many enemies. Later, as the enemy's fresh troops rushed to the scene, they retreated and held the high ground north of Jiangcun. On the morning of the 7th, our army continued to arrive at the Guo'tang and Shilong areas from Xin'jie, and launched a fierce attack on Jiangcun with dense fire. More than a thousand enemies who had gathered in Jiangcun stubbornly resisted with fortifications. Jiangcun is an important stronghold on the outskirts of Guangzhou, and is a place that our army and the enemy must fight for. Therefore, both armies fought with all their strength, and the battle was extremely fierce. Our army repeatedly charged, and the enemy could not hold out and retreated into the market town to defend it. The stalemate lasted until dusk, with 200-300 enemies killed. Our vanguard has crossed Gaotang in Jiangcun and is heading towards Dalang, Xiaocun and other places. The enemy army retreated south along the railway, abandoning a large amount of military equipment and supplies. Our army pursued closely, and the vanguard was only a dozen miles away from Guangzhou on the 8th.</p>
<p>The Enemy Assembles Heavy Troops to Defend Shijing</p>
<p>Due to the rapid turn of events on the northern route, the Guangzhou enemy military authorities were panicked and sent urgent telegrams to various routes for assistance. Since the 6th, the enemy from Sanshui, Foshan, Jiujiang, Daliang, and Shilong have been transporting troops to Guangzhou in a hurry, which is rarely seen. After Xin'jie and Jiangcun fell into our hands one after another, the outer defense line of Guangzhou has been breached. The enemy is now preparing for internal line operations, intensifying the deployment of defenses in the Xicun, Guanghua Highway, and Liuhua Bridge area in the northwest suburbs of the city, and reinforcing heavy troops in the Shijing area, attempting to fight a decisive battle with our army here. On the 6th and 7th, about a thousand enemy soldiers were transferred from Guangzhou to Shijing, as well as heavy artillery and tanks. A large number of enemy grain and ammunition stored in Shijing were transported back to Guangzhou along the Guangdong-Han Railway. It seems that their intention is to abandon Shijing and retreat to the suburbs of the city if necessary. According to front-line intelligence, the enemy in Guangzhou has been reinforcing defenses in the suburbs in recent days, and has designated the areas near the suburbs as martial law zones, implementing emergency preparedness. From the 6th, within ten days, civilians are generally not allowed to enter or leave the Guanghua Highway area outside the northwest suburbs, otherwise they will be treated as leaking military secrets, designated as guerrillas, and killed without mercy.</p>
<p>Enemy General Killed in Action in the Battle of Shiqian</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy from Conghua gathered at Shengang and Taipingchang in order to contain our army's counter-offensive, and sent troops to raid the rear of our army in Huaxian on the 6th and 7th. On the 6th, the enemy from Shengang sent more than a thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery to cross the Yangcun River and assemble troops at Wangmu, advancing towards Shiqian City. They were intercepted by a certain unit of our 12th Army Group in the Maluo Mountain area on the border of Conghua, west of Shiqian, and launched a battle. Further investigation revealed that the battle lasted until dusk, and as a result, more than a hundred enemy officers and soldiers were killed, dozens of enemy soldiers were captured, and countless weapons were seized. The enemy commander of the battle, Major Zuo Mohe (battalion commander), was also killed on the front line. The remaining enemy has collapsed and retreated in a panic. The enemy force that attacked Jiulianfen was completely wiped out by our army on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<p>Enemy Army in Huaxian Makes a Last-Ditch Stand</p>
<p>The enemy in Huaxian, due to the loss of Xin'jie, Shijiao, and Yangcun to our army, has lost its footing and is being surrounded and annihilated by our army. After our Huaxian Kongshi captured Shijiao Market, the main force of the enemy army from Shengang and Taipingchang in Conghua lost contact with Xiangshan Huaxian. Our army cut off the southern section of the Guangdong-Han Railway, and the enemy's rear is under great threat. However, there are still three to four thousand enemies stationed in the northern part of Huaxian, under our encirclement and control. Therefore, in the past two days, the enemy has been forced to make a last-ditch stand, constantly attacking our army in an attempt to break through our encirclement line. On the 6th, the remnants of the enemy who fled from Shidongwei in Huaxian to Huangdong joined forces with more than a thousand enemies at Longkouzhuang on the 7th and launched a fierce attack on our army. A part of the enemy force, numbering more than five hundred, fled to Hengkeng in the north of Huaxian City, and another part of more than three hundred advanced to Chuangang in the west of the city. Our army met them head-on and launched a fierce tug-of-war. At night, our army bravely attacked the enemy, and the enemy's morale wavered, and they began to retreat along the original route to the south, suffering heavy casualties, abandoning many corpses on the Guanghua Highway. The enemy who fled to Xin'an and the east of the railway still occupied strongholds such as Nanbei of Xin'an, and reinforced more than a thousand troops in Caodong, Lao Huangmaokeng, and Luchuan Pit to build fortifications in an attempt to defend to the death. Our army is currently sweeping through the area.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Our Army's Counter-Offensive Intensifies; Chaos in Guangzhou; Our Planes Attack Baiyun Airport; Traitors Killed, Feeling Uneasy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Shamian Express News] Recently, our Guangdong Anti-Japanese War military has launched a large-scale counter-offensive, and victories have been reported successively in the east, west, and north of the Three Rivers. Guangzhou enemy chief Ando believes that our army's counter-offensive is unstoppable and should store up more difficulties. Recently, the enemy's troop movements have been very busy, and the order in Guangzhou city has become increasingly chaotic. The latest information from various aspects is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Our Army's Counter-Offensive; Enemy Soldiers Anxious</p>
<p>Since our army began its counter-offensive, enemy chief Ando has been extremely anxious, and has been transferring enemy troops from various units to reinforce various lines. Recently, even the enemy soldiers in the city have been transferred, and only about two thousand are left to protect Guangzhou. He sent an urgent telegram to Taiwan for assistance, which is enough to prove the emptiness of the enemy in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Two Enemy Planes Shot Down by Our Forces</p>
<p>Our brave air force appears in the city's airspace twice a day, bombing the Tianhe and Baiyun airports, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy air force. Yesterday morning, the 5th, nine of our planes raided Guangzhou, and two enemy planes hastily took off to fight, but were surrounded by our planes and the pilots were wounded. They flew towards Yuanpu in dismay. As a result, our planes destroyed the Baiyun Airport machine depot, and scattered a large number of anti-aggression leaflets in the airspace of Guangdong, mobilizing the people.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Residents Flee Their Homes</p>
<p>The order in the city is extremely chaotic, and robberies occur several times a day. Most of the shops have closed their doors and suspended business, and on the people's side, due to our army's attack approaching Guangzhou, they are fleeing to Lizhi, Mazha, Hecun and other villages. The city is now very deserted, and it is expected that the city will be placed under strict martial law soon. Gambling dens and opium dens are mostly closed at night. Guangzhou has once again entered a state of war.</p>
<p>Assassination Groups Target Traitors</p>
<p>Our underground assassination groups in the city have become active, and have launched surprise attacks on enemy camps in Guangzhou from time to time, achieving considerable results, so that the enemy soldiers cannot sleep peacefully. Recently, an assassination group has been formed to deal specifically with shameless traitors, so traitors such as Lu Chunrong are extremely frightened, hiding in Meihuacun and Dongshan, and do not dare to go out. It is reported that the assassination group was organized by General Ye Ting and is extremely strict.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Fierce Battle at Luofu Mountain; Enemy Attacks Lianhe Again, Repelled <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Dongjiang Express News) Our Eastern Route Army's counter-offensive military affairs, after the Chief General Qi Wei formulated its overall plan and actively deployed it, has made several contacts with the enemy's outposts in Zengcheng. The enemy again attempted to invade on the 7th of this month. The following is a report of the situation.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Occurs at Luofu</p>
<p>At about 8 p.m. on the 7th, more than 700 enemy soldiers from Zengcheng attacked our Luofu Mountain in three routes, and 18 enemy planes provided cover, dropping more than 30 bombs. Our Liu Regiment of the XXX cooperated with the guerrilla teams and engaged the enemy, resulting in a fierce battle. The enemy was at a disadvantage in night battles and began to flee back to Zengcheng in a panic, suffering heavy casualties. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue, seizing a large number of military supplies.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Invade Lianhe Again</p>
<p>At the same time in the morning, the enemy sent more than a hundred people with two small artillery guns, using enemy planes for cover, and invaded Lianhe from both Lizhizhuang and Botang, in an attempt to probe the strength of our various points. Our Wei Regiment of the XXX, stationed in Lianhe, Fuhe, Changning and other areas in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, and the various units of Yang Linjun under the 1st Guerrilla Detachment, joined forces to attack the enemy. The enemy was suddenly attacked by our army and retreated along the original route. In this battle, more than 20 enemies were killed.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Harass Huibo</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, an enemy plane flew low along the Bo-Zeng Highway to reconnoiter, circling over Boluo City, and dropped two bombs, one landing in Zijing Lane in the city, destroying two civilian houses, and the other landing in Baisui Fang, fortunately without casualties. Over Longmen, 14 enemy planes were found, flying along the Guang-Zeng Road and circling around Luofu Mountain for several weeks, before flying to Boluo and Huiyang for reconnaissance. In addition, two other enemy planes reconnoitered at the Xinzhutang Station along the Zengchuan Road, and then flew to Hukeng Township, dropping a bomb, injuring an old farmer and several livestock.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Enemy Ambushed on Taiping Road; Recovery of Wancheng and Shilong Confirmed; Enemy Casualties Exceed 400, Retreating to Shitan to Defend <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express News] The police station here confirmed the news of the recovery of Wancheng and Shilong. On the morning before yesterday, our Ou Regiment of Wu Qiwai's department and the 8th Security Regiment, in coordination with Luo Fengxiang's department, bombarded the enemy from step by step towards Shilong Wancheng, and the fierce battle lasted until 1 p.m. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties, and our army bravely charged. On the Shilong side, the enemy's formation wavered, and retreated to Shitan and Wancheng. Our Ou Department entered Shilong at 2 p.m. Wancheng felt that Shilong was lost and its flank was threatened, and under the fierce attack of our army, retreated towards Taiping at 1:15 p.m. Our teams were prepared early and waited for the retreat, launching a pincer attack. More than a hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and four machine guns and more than ten rifles were captured. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 400 casualties, and we also had heroic sacrifices. Yesterday, our army sent personnel to clear the streets and sent teams to sweep the enemy army in the suburbs of Wancheng, while implementing a security towards the enemy in Taiping. The enemy in Shiwu has crossed the river and retreated to Shitan to defend it, and has blown up the Shitan Bridge to prevent our advance.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The False Chairman of Yanbu is Captured; Escorted to the Guerrilla Headquarters for Interrogation <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Nanhai Express News] Yanbu is located near the Lujian border in the ninth district of Nanhai County. It is the transportation center of the Guangdong-Foshan Road, with a prosperous population. Since the enemy invasion, a false maintenance committee has been established there, with a certain Huang and a certain Zhong serving as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, acting arbitrarily and causing great resentment among the villagers. At 5 a.m. on the 5th of this month, 300 guerrillas lurking in Lujian rushed into the market town, killing 13 false policemen on the spot and capturing several others. From the mouths of the false policemen, they learned that the false maintenance committee chairmen Zhong and Huang were hiding in the Fourth Security Division on Zhulin Street, and immediately sent teams to search and arrest them, capturing them, tying them up in front of the association's door for public display, and raising our Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national flag, which fluttered in the wind for more than 30 hours. At 6 p.m. on the 6th, the enemy army stationed there heard the news and sent 300-400 enemy soldiers to reinforce. Our guerrillas fought with them for about an hour before calmly withdrawing. The two traitors Zhong and Huang and the 13 false policemen have been escorted to the First District Guerrilla Column Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Active Daughters of Gaoming <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Peng</p>
<p>Holding Gaoming on the important military artery of the Xijiang River, the Gaoming Highway, makes it a crucial barrier for consolidating the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. If Gaoming were to fall, the enemy's "rapid units" would undoubtedly launch an even faster attack on Zhaoqing. In this area, in addition to deploying strong forces, we also have advantageous terrain, because clusters of mountains stretch through the upper reaches of Gaoming, posing a significant obstacle to mechanized troops. However, there is a kind of immeasurable potential that is enough to shock people, and that is the popular revolutionary fervor that the heroic youth of Gaoming have, for generations, nurtured among the vast peasantry. As the war of resistance broke out, this fervor in Gaoming did not wait for enemy soldiers to intrude and reap the consequences on their land. If anyone wants to praise the Guangdong spirit, the people of Gaoming can do so without the slightest shame. You know, batch after batch of hot-blooded young farmers from Gaoming County volunteered to go to the front lines, with the number already exceeding 260. This magnificent and heroic spirit proclaims the success of the work of the people's movement comrades, because in the ranks of the people's movement in Gaoming County, before September 18th, it was not just a single-sex male combination. In fact, the women's activities sometimes achieve outstanding results.</p>
<p>At that time, the Women's Anti-Japanese Comrades Association was the most critical activity of the daughters of Gaoming. In Gaoming County, with a population of less than 100,000, they had already recruited more than 20,000 members. Following the division of regions, three district comrades associations were established under the county comrades association. Among them, the three district comrades associations were the most active and had the most prominent working effects. There is a touching story: when they held a general meeting of members, one of the most characteristic staff members specialized in managing the members' hats. When rural women go to prosperous markets, wearing hats woven from bamboo strips is indispensable. Hats numbered 2, 3, etc., were neatly stacked in a spacious room, and disputes over priority never broke out at the moment of taking the hats.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of salvation work it is, they never fall behind, such as raising comfort goods, expanding production, military service, sanitation, buying bonds... they send cadres to cooperate, and the male members of the Youth Anti-Japanese Association spare no effort to run to various villages to launch surprise attacks, perform dramas, give speeches, put up slogans, and write wall newspapers, injecting all their strength into new tasks. In the solemn work, they cannot see the coyness of rural women, although it is inevitable that a small number of old women discriminate against them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they never abandon their own issues. In the declining women's groups, there are desolate thorns waiting for women to discover and uproot themselves. They want to eliminate women's illiteracy and deepen anti-Japanese knowledge, so they widely establish women's literacy classes and women's rescue classes to expand women's education. Under the jurisdiction of the Women's Anti-Japanese Association, there are organized first aid teams, intelligence teams, transportation teams, guerrilla teams, and traitor-clearing teams. Judging from general imagination, these various wartime technical teams are of course nothing more than capturing various beautiful names, but with their working enthusiasm, the instructors of each team are very happy to accept their voluntary teaching positions.</p>
<p>Comforting the families of soldiers, bidding farewell to volunteers, organizing comfort teams to comfort those on the front lines, they work hard to do it. In the collection of comfort goods, the "Youth Anti-Japanese Association" cannot compare with them. Every launch, they are deeply excited and compete with the "Youth Anti-Japanese Association."</p>
<p>Miss Ruan Liuhong, the executive director, told me that in the areas that have fallen into enemy hands, the lives and chastity of our sisters are... Hearing this is really heartbreaking. I want to analyze two main reasons for this: first... second, the sisters are too weak. Chinese women have been bound for thousands of years, and the power of resistance has gradually been eroded over this long period. Upon hearing the sound of... and the fear between genders makes them lose themselves. They tremble, faint, and willingly give the enemy... the opportunity to manipulate them. I see clearly, recently, the enemy's attempt to attack the upper reaches of the Xijiang River is even more urgent. In our work, we must improve women's understanding of the enemy, strengthen women's skills in killing the enemy, and stimulate their national hatred. Everyone believes that in the occupied areas... if a trained woman quietly resolves the enemy, it is nothing surprising.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Movies and Drama: A Plot as Vast as the Sky <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— A dispatch from Chongqing by Tongye</p>
<p>The Air Force Movie Produced by the Central Photography Studio</p>
<p>Regarding "Air Force Movies," Shanghai Lianhua Company previously produced a film called "Iron Crow." Readers are surely aware of its success. Now, the Central Photography Studio is releasing "A Sky of Ten Thousand Miles," which can be said to be a great aviation film. Not only is the plot intricate and mysterious, but the scenes are also intense and exciting. Watching it is sure to make your blood boil. Unfortunately, we people of Hong Kong can only yearn for it for the time being, as it cannot be shown here until the final victory. I will now introduce the plot to the readers, which may provide some spiritual comfort!</p>
<p>(Editor)</p>
<p>On September 18th, the Japanese bandits seized our four northeastern provinces, turning thirty million compatriots into slaves. Over five million square miles of land were trampled by enemy hooves. Vast wealth, huge amounts of military supplies, along with two hundred and sixty airplanes, all fell into enemy hands. The Northeast Aviation School was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Gao Fei, a mechanical engineer from the Northeast Aviation Corps, followed the masses into the interior. During the journey, they were chased and strafed by enemy planes, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. A young woman, Bai Shanfeng, rushed to support her injured father, leaving her younger sister, Xiao Yun, behind. In this perilous situation, Gao Fei hid and narrowly escaped death. Gao watched the enemy plane, his heart burning with rage.</p>
<p>Gao had a relative in Jinan, so he enrolled in the affiliated middle school of Qilu University. After class, he would always engage in physical exercise. One day, in the sports field, he chatted with his classmates Yue Yiqin and Zhao Wanjia. Yue was lying on the grass, gazing at three or five airplanes circling in the sky, as if lost in thought. Gao asked him about it. Yue smiled and showed him the advertisement he had clipped from the newspaper for the Central Aviation School's recruitment of flight students. Gao and Zhao also showed their own clippings of the same advertisement. With a shared determination, the three of them decided to leave Qilu and pursue aviation studies.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, our country has strived to build up its air force. Young people from all over the country have come in droves. Gao, Yue, and Zhao passed the preliminary physical and academic tests and joined the Air Force Enlistment Camp, receiving one year of army training before being promoted to flight students. At the commencement ceremony, they respectfully listened to the instructions, received the Air Force regulations and creeds, and sang the aviation school's anthem. It was majestic and soared to the clouds.</p>
<p>Gao, Yue, and Zhao, along with other flight students, received instruction from Squadron Leader Gao Zhihang. They were divided into groups to learn basic flight skills. Their first time in the clouds was like ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Shi Qi, a mechanical officer, was loyal to his service. He once jokingly told Gao that mechanical engineers are like bird keepers, washing them, brushing them, coaxing them, and comforting them to make them fly, sing, and soar. Except, these are iron birds.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of passionate young men were fostered and trained by the nation, like thousands of iron locust trees forged into steel in a furnace. Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students took the future responsibilities of the nation upon their shoulders. Under the strict discipline of ironclad training, they woke up early, formed ranks, practiced flying, exercised, and rested. Day by day, they bravely moved forward. After one year, two years, three years, Zhao, Yue, and Gao all graduated and became squadron members, some serving as instructors to train future air force flight students.</p>
<p>Amidst the arduous and intense training, there was also appropriate recreation. One bright day, four military trucks drove out of the aviation school gate, carrying flight students and teachers on a trip to Hangzhou. Gao Di, Dayong, had a friendly relationship with Qing'er, a young woman who owned a fruit shop outside the school. As usual, the aviation school students bought a large amount of fruit from Qing'er's shop. On this day, Gao Fei, Wanli, Shi Qi, and Gu Changkong, four close friends, were all there. Shi, Zhao, and Yue deliberately made things difficult for Gao and Gu, buying all the fruit in Qing'er's basket to share with their fellow students and teachers in the truck. Amidst laughter and war songs, they quickly arrived in Hangzhou. The air force cadets dispersed or formed groups to sightsee, visit friends, climb mountains, ride horses, or race boats. The scenic spots between Six Harmonies Pagoda and Three Temples of Tianzhu were enlivened and enhanced by the presence of the air force cadets.</p>
<p>Gao, Zhao, Gu, and Shi toured the Su Causeway together and were struck by the beauty of a young woman, Bai Shanfeng, whom they saw as a celestial being. They wanted to strike up a conversation with her, as none of the four were married. Unfortunately, they did not know who she was. Later, they entered the newly opened Fengyun Cafe and learned that the woman was the cafe owner's daughter, Bai Shanfeng.</p>
<p>Soon after, a group of elementary and middle school students entered the cafe to raise funds for airplane donations. First, they sang patriotic songs, "Tomorrow of Victory," saying that those who can contribute strength should contribute strength, and those who can contribute money should contribute money. The leader of the singing was Bai Shanfeng's younger sister, Bai Xiaoling. After singing, they went to each table to solicit donations. The air force cadets generously donated, and other guests also contributed. However, one guest, facing his girlfriend, resented the students' singing for interrupting his conversation.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Gao, Zhao, and others accompanied the Bai sisters on a boat trip to the mountains, singing and enjoying themselves. They saw Yan Haiwen and Ms. Liu walking together, enjoying the scenery. The group jokingly asked Bai if she had a lover. Bai replied that she had two: one was the wind from Changbai Mountain, and the other was the young Chinese air force. Bai then smiled and sang, wishing herself to be forever the wind, awakening the sweet dreams of infatuated men and resentful women, and shattering the cowardly hearts of rebellious officials and traitors. Every day, she would brush against the soaring iron wings and kiss the tanned faces of the air force cadets. When invaders came to devour us, the storm would rise, stirring up a huge wave of resistance, and carrying the righteous army, willing to fight for the survival of the nation and for the freedom and equality of the world.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the afternoon, as usual, the aviation personnel returned to school by truck. The Bai sisters waved goodbye from the hillside, their singing echoing the songs of the cadets in the truck.</p>
<p>The July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and war clouds loomed over the Far East. The northern war was going badly. The air force personnel, after reading the newspaper, were filled with boiling blood, wishing they could immediately set out to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Feng, Yan, Zhao, and Shi, four riders, visited Bai Shanfeng and saw that the cafe was half-closed, with tables and chairs being moved, preparing to close down. When asked why, Bai replied that she was going to abandon the cafe life. The group understood. Bai told them that she did not want to leave the four of them in the future, so she was leaving today. Bai had secretly signed up for a battlefield nursing training class at a hospital. On August 13th, the Shanghai battle broke out, and the full-scale war of resistance began. The air force mobilization order was issued, and all the air force cadets cheered. In a tragic and passionate atmosphere, each member made a will, showing their determination to sacrifice their lives for the country. On August 14th, enemy planes came to bomb Hangzhou, and Gao Zhihang and Yue Yiqin led their planes into aerial combat, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On July 17th, Yan Haiwen sacrificed himself for righteousness in Shanghai. On August 19th, Shen Chonghui heroically crashed his plane into an enemy warship in Longkou. Our Wu Yong bombing unit also established special achievements. The victory of the Chinese Air Force gave the world a thunderbolt from a clear sky. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e54">MGM's Representative in Shanghai Discusses Shanghai Audiences (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>does not have as many moving actions. After we finished filming, we worried that this film would not be as popular in China as it was in the United States. However, when it was released,</p>
<p>Chinese audiences flocked to it.</p>
<p>"The reason why this film is so popular is that Chinese movie audiences admire Norma Shearer. At least that's one of the reasons. The reason why Chinese people like Norma Shearer is that her slim and beautiful appearance is perfectly in line with the Chinese ideal of beauty," he said.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that among MGM's female stars, besides Norma Shearer, the most popular with Chinese audiences is Jeanette MacDonald, and among male stars, Clark Gable is the most popular. Since 1931, MGM has rented out about forty to fifty films in Shanghai each year. The situation is similar in Hong Kong and Tianjin.</p>
<p>American films are distributed all over the world. In countries where English is not spoken, subtitles are used. In some countries where listening to English is prohibited, the dialogue is dubbed in the local language. This can be very complicated, especially with songs.</p>
<p>Experienced comedies, historical stories, and what are generally called "family films" are the three types of films that MGM considers to be the focus of its production in 1938. As for whether great operas will be introduced to the screen in the future, the spokesperson said that Hollywood producers are still hesitant because the only purpose of film companies is to make money. It is uncertain whether such films will be popular with American audiences, let alone others. In short, the money spent on film releases still has to come from the audience's pockets.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Xu He Cup Second Round Match: South China Faces Army Today; To Be Held at the Naval Stadium at 4 PM; South China's Defense Is Incomplete, But the Frontline Is Strong and Victory Is Expected <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Half of this year's six major football championships have already fallen into the hands of our Chinese team. Our Chinese team has also reached the final stage of competing for the remaining three titles. However, whether they can sweep all the championships depends on the efforts of all the players. Judging from the recent situation, with the strength of our Chinese team, no foreign team can seize its advantage. If they are not satisfied with having already won three titles and know how to encourage themselves, then sweeping the championships is indeed possible. May all the members of our Chinese team strive for this and complete this glorious creation. This is what we deeply hope for.</p>
<p>Today is the date for the second round of the Xu He Cup match, to be held at the Naval Stadium at 4 PM. This competition adopts a single round-robin system and a 90-minute format. The scoring method is the same as in the league. It is also necessary to mention the origin of the competition. Before this competition was held, some charitable organizations, believing that football could raise funds, invited South China to send a team to play in charity matches. South China, considering it a good cause, always agreed. However, as the number of requests increased day by day, even charitable organizations from Guangzhou and Macau requested South China to treat everyone equally and provide assistance. At this point, South China was overwhelmed and found it difficult to refuse. After much consideration, they obtained the consent of Mr. Luo Xuhe, who donated a silver cup to be used as a prize. Therefore, this charitable competition was created in the 1934-35 season.</p>
<p>At that time, South China initiated the competition and obtained the agreement of the Army and Navy Sports Associations to cooperate, thus making the event a reality. It was announced that they would co-organize the competition. Thus, this triangular competition became a form of charitable endeavor. Due to the limited number of participating teams, only three, the competition adopted a single round-robin system and a 90-minute format. Each team played twice, and the team with the highest score won the championship. The matches were held at a neutral venue.</p>
<p>The first match of that year was held in October last year. At that time, the Navy had abundant talent and great strength, so they defeated the Army with a score of 3-1. In previous years, the Army had always maintained a winning record against the Navy, but this year was different, which shows that in football, the strong cannot rely on their strength for long.</p>
<p>The Navy has a high chance of winning the championship after winning the first match, but it still depends on whether they can defeat South China in the third match, which is equivalent to the final. That match will be held on the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>In today's match, South China's defense has been altered due to Mai Shaohan's slight illness and Liu Qingcai's absence, similar to the recent special Silver Shield final between South China and the Police, with only Xie Jinhong replacing the left center-back.</p>
<p>Some people believe that South China's defense is incomplete and that it is worrying to face the Army's frontline. However, judging from Li Guowei's performance in the recent Silver Shield final, it was very satisfactory. Guo Yingqi also performed well, and as his steps become more familiar, his performance will naturally improve.</p>
<p>The Army's frontline does not select the three outstanding players from Middlesex but uses players from the second team, which makes observers quite puzzled. Could it be that the person in charge of selection has a unique vision and can distinguish talent beyond the obvious? However, I have seen that Liddes' skills are excellent. As for how Shu Shu and Mei Shi perform, it is not very clear. Now that they have suddenly risen to prominence, they should not be inferior players. However, this match is a matter of life and death for the Army. If they win, they still have a chance of winning the championship. If they lose, their chances are over. However, the personnel selection does not seem to be a match for South China.</p>
<p>Based on my observation, South China's frontline is sharp and unstoppable and has the potential to win by four goals or more. However, the defense is slightly incomplete, so it is difficult to guarantee that they will not lose. However, I dare to say that South China will ultimately be the winner.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Public Basketball Tournament: South China Defeats Chung Sing; Tonight, Eastern Faces South China <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In the public men's basketball tournament, Chung Sing faced South China yesterday. The former is a first-class team in the local basketball scene, while the latter is a leader in school basketball. Their players are like newborn calves and are truly rising stars. Regarding the strength of both sides, most people believed that Chung Sing had a better chance of winning. Unexpectedly, South China won with a score of 64-59. During the game, Chung Sing was ahead only at the beginning with a score of 6-5, but then they were at a disadvantage the whole time. Therefore, South China's victory was not accidental. Their shooting was unexpectedly effective, which was also a lucky star for South China. Although their coordination may not be flawless, the individual skills of the players are truly superb. Each of them has agile skills, and their positions are flexible during the game. Their turning is quick, and their shooting, whether backhand or one-handed, can succeed even when surrounded by the opponent. The marvel is truly breathtaking. Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen were indispensable to South China's victory. Li Junsheng also made great contributions in the first half, laying the foundation for victory. All the members of Chung Sing did their best, and their defeat was due to bad luck, not their fault. Chen Ruzheng and Guo Zhihong are the soul of the team. In yesterday's game, Chen and Guo were closely guarded by Chung Sing's Zhong Ling and Chen Zan, and they often felt like they were facing enemies on all sides. Secondly, although their shooting postures were wonderful, they rarely scored. In the first half, Su Bohui and Li Baifen failed to prevent Li Junsheng's sneak attacks, which prevented them from gaining the ball in the second half and achieving victory. They should be blamed for this. Shen Ruiqing tried his best to fight back in difficult situations and often saved Chung Sing from decline. His contribution was truly significant. It is a pity that the coach, Chen Ruzheng, and Guo Zhihong, were trapped in desperate situations every time they attacked, so their individual scores were insufficient to turn the tide. After the start of the game, South China's Li Junsheng made a side shot from the edge of the court, opening the scoring. Chung Sing's Chen, Zheng, and Shen Ruiqing then scored one after another. Afterwards, both sides scored, making the score 6-5, with Chung Sing in the lead. Then, South China's Li Junsheng scored twice, tying the score at 9-9. As South China's Zhong, Li, and Chen launched repeated attacks, Chung Sing's Su and Li defended poorly and were overtaken by South China with scores of 17-11 and 23-16. Until the end of the first half, Chung Sing was still behind 25-32. When the sides changed, Chung Sing's Chen Ruzheng and Shen Ruiqing successively scored, catching up head-on. Unexpectedly, South China's Huang Zuode showed his strength, using his agile posture to move back and forth under the enemy's basket, leaving Chung Sing's defenders helpless. They were again behind 50-56. Until Shen Ruiqing's sharp edge was revealed, he closely followed South China with 55-58. But in the last few minutes, South China's Huang Zuode and Chen Zanyin successively made attacks. Until the end of the game, South China won with a score of 64-59.

<h3 id="e58">Reporter's Sports Committee Schedules Trip to Lantau Island; Members and Friends Welcome to Participate on the 14th of This Month <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Aside from Tai Mo Shan (3,010 feet), which is a famous mountain, Phoenix Ridge, the highest peak of Lantau Island, at 3,065 feet above sea level, is actually the second highest. The Zen forests and monasteries all over the mountain, the ancient fortresses of Tung Chung (now Wah Ying College), and the market town of Tai O are all unique. Moreover, because it is far from Hong Kong Island and takes time to travel to and from, there are not many tourists on ordinary days. This makes those who visit it feel as if they are in another world, like an inner pure land. As for those who climb to the highest peak, if they encounter clear weather, they can see Hong Kong Island to the east, Macau to the west, Cheung Chau Island to the south, and Guishan Island to the north. Moreover, appreciating the vast waves of the Lingdingyang Sea is even more inspiring and evokes infinite feelings. The Sports Committee of the Hong Kong Reporters Association, in order to strengthen the bonds between members and promote "national defense-style travel," has scheduled the second trip to Lantau Island and Phoenix Ridge as its destination. Although reporters may still be tired from working late into the night and have not had enough sleep, occasionally shortening a few hours of rest time and going to nature, although the spirit may be slightly damaged and the muscles may be tired, the joy and interest gained will surely make up for it. Members and their friends are welcome to participate. The arrangements are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The second trip of the Sports Committee of the Hong Kong Reporters Association will be on February 14 (Friday) to Lantau Island.</p>
<p>(2) Gather at the Cheung Chau Pier at 4:00 AM and depart on the Min Yao Ferry at 4:30 AM. Take the same ferry back to Hong Kong in the afternoon at 6:00 PM and arrive at 9:00 PM to dismiss the team.</p>
<p>(3) In order to facilitate those who cannot travel far and to suit everyone's needs, the route is divided into two: (A) First climb Tung Chung, visit Wah Ying College, pass the South China Monastery, climb Ditangzai, pass various hermitages, and take the road to Ngong Ping, pass Luk Wu, and descend to Tai O. (B) Temporarily separate from the previous team at the hermitage of Farlin and others, and take the path behind the hermitage to climb Phoenix Peak, descend to Ngong Ping, Luk Wu, and meet the previous team at Tai O.</p>
<p>(4) Phoenix Peak is also known as Guantoushan, and there is a Luohan Pagoda and a One-Tree Rock on it. Ngong Ping has the Lotus Platform Stone and the Stone Drum. There is a Stone Ox at the foot of the mountain, and the Tai O seaside has the General Stone and other famous scenic spots and strange relics. The three major Zen forests of Ditangzai, Ngong Ping, and Luk Wu are especially worth visiting and browsing.</p>
<p>(5) The ferry fares and tea are at your own expense. The Association will provide lunch. If you want to eat vegetarian food at the Zen temple or have a big fish meal, you can do so at your own discretion. The items to bring should be light, but please bring enough medication.</p>
<p>(6) Registration starts today and closes on the evening of the 12th. There is no fee, but you must participate as agreed. Participants should notify by phone: 1. Huang Fenming, editorial department of Overseas Chinese Daily (evenings); 2. Li Zhiming, editorial department of Xunhuan Daily (daytime). The quota is limited to 30 people, and registration will close when the quota is full.</p>
<p>(7) In order to facilitate and adapt to the time and route, there may be some temporary changes, but everything will be done to suit the majority.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Over Two Hundred Refugee Children Travel to Victoria Peak; Sir Robert Ho Tung Provides Refreshments <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Over two hundred refugee children from the Children's Welfare Home traveled to Victoria Peak yesterday morning in the beautiful spring sunshine. They were led by Reverend He Ailing, the director of the Home. Hong Kong gentleman Sir Robert Ho Tung gave them a warm reception and provided them with a rich variety of Chinese and Western food and tea. He also encouraged them to study diligently, be cautious, and strive to serve the country. The children listened and smiled, and the gardens of Sir Robert Ho Tung's mansion were filled with laughter. At 5:30 PM, the two hundred refugee children thanked him for his hospitality and returned. According to He Shenzhang, they hoped that people from all walks of life who care for refugee children would also invite the children more often, for which they would be very grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e62">A Bloodless, Foolish Sporting Method? <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— —Wang Xuezheng—</p>
<p>(2) (Continued from Part 2)</p>
<p>When doing leg exercises or exercises involving the body, arms, and legs simultaneously, the carbon dioxide content in the blood increases the fastest. The oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exhalation of the lungs can increase by seven or eight times more than usual. The speed of blood circulation can also be seven or eight times faster than usual. However, when performing "Two-arm Press," "Two-arm Curl," "Lateral Raises," or even "Back Lift," the changes in the heart and lungs rarely reach this level. Furthermore, during exercise, the body is also undergoing a selective process. The parts that work more receive more blood supply. During exercise, the blood vessels in the muscles expand, allowing a large amount of blood to flow into them. We only need to look at the difference in size and strength between the leg muscles and the arms, shoulders, and chest to know that the blood flow to the legs during leg exercises must be greater than the blood flow to the arms, shoulders, and chest during exercises involving those parts. Therefore, the impact on the circulatory system is also greater.</p>
<p>According to statistics from American universities, track and field athletes have the highest incidence of heart disease or heart weakness among athletes. In 1910, George Woods, the world champion in the quarter-mile race, also died suddenly from heart disease. This is indeed a direct result of overexertion. In 1900, Tom Storey, a Yale University rower, fell ill after a race due to overexertion. As a result, he died of lung disease at the age of 35. Because of temporary overexertion, his body suffered significant damage, gradually weakened, and could not resist disease. But is this kind of exercise really a bloodless, foolish sporting method? To be fair, it is not the foolishness of those who advocate running and rowing or the sports themselves, but the foolishness of George Woods and Tom Storey themselves or their coaches.</p>
<p>A classmate of mine was once the captain of the tennis team at a Shanghai university's affiliated middle school. After graduating from middle school, he transferred to one of the most famous national universities in the country and was selected as the second singles player. This classmate loved tennis and had excellent skills. Because he wanted to pursue further studies, he practiced tirelessly every day. However, in less than a year, he also died of a sudden illness. Should tennis also be blamed?</p>
<p>Not long ago, a boxer and a football player in Hong Kong also died from injuries sustained during competitions. Should this also be called deadly sports?</p>
<p>I also have a classmate who is proficient in football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and other ball sports. He also often practiced track and field. He seemed very strong, but he had a bad habit of masturbation, and it was very serious. After several years, he also died of tuberculosis in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>For example, football is very popular in Hong Kong, but I know at least one person who strongly opposes football. And aren't there people who criticize basketball, tennis, track and field, and other sports? We must never blindly follow the pointless opinions of one or a few people.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Chengbo said, "People with heart or lung disease should not engage in strenuous exercise," and also said that his younger brother's lungs were weak, then it is certain that people with weak lungs should not engage in strenuous exercise. However, appropriate exercise can help people with weak lungs regain their health. What is considered appropriate exercise depends on the sport itself, as well as the individual's strength and needs. What a strong person considers easy exercise, a weak person may not be able to handle. It should be noted that even gentle exercises or even walking are sometimes not suitable for people who are very weak or seriously ill. Incorrect methods of calisthenics, such as excessive time, incorrect breathing, or excessive exercise, can also have significant drawbacks. Although tennis is considered a moderate sport that is very suitable for middle-aged or elderly people, we have seen some tennis players collapse and lie on the ground after strenuous matches.</p>
<p>In short, strenuous exercise is exercise that requires 65% to 80% of one's full strength, while light exercise requires 40% to 50% of one's full strength. Although every movement we make is exercise, it is not the most effective exercise and cannot develop the body to its strongest point. It may not even be enough to maintain health. Healthy people who exercise at 65% to 80% of their full strength for half an hour or an hour every day cannot be said to be overexerting themselves. Just look at the laborers and our frontline soldiers, as well as the young people who are being trained. The energy they expend every day is definitely above 65% of their full strength. Will they all die of acute pneumonia? Only people who are inherently unhealthy cannot handle appropriate strenuous exercise. However, appropriate light exercise can often help unhealthy people regain their health. The so-called strenuous exercise does not only refer to the weight of equipment. The most important thing is the way of exercising. Therefore, in dumbbell exercises, as long as the weight of the equipment is lightened, the number of repetitions is reduced, or the duration of continuous exercise is shortened, there are many simple exercises that are suitable for weak people. If you exert all your strength every time you exercise, it is not the exercise that is deadly or foolish, but our own foolishness, or even suicide.</p>
<p>Mr. Chengbo advised his younger brother, "It is better to practice deep breathing and calisthenics properly, and first strengthen your internal organs. Don't just focus on external appearance." He also quoted the words of many famous Chinese and foreign physical educators to advise him. In fact, if done properly, dumbbell and chest expander exercises are beneficial to both the inside and outside of the body. Although the effects of various exercises may have some differences, the main effect is consistent: to develop muscles and strengthen internal organs and strength, that is, to promote breathing, circulation, digestion, metabolism, and other functions. As a result, the functions of other organs are also greatly improved. Therefore, in reality, various localized exercises can also improve the health of the entire body. Moreover, to strengthen the internal organs, it is necessary to develop the voluntary muscles. The muscles of the heart and stomach are all involuntary muscles. To develop these involuntary muscles, on the one hand, it is necessary to promote breathing and circulation. On the other hand, it is necessary to develop the voluntary muscles that are close to these involuntary muscles.</p>
<p>Mr. Chengbo also mobilized his younger brother to pay attention to deep breathing exercises. It should be known that deep breathing exercises, if not done properly, can also have drawbacks. Although this exercise seems very simple, very few people have a deep understanding of it. For example, the method of abdominal contraction, muscle relaxation, deep breathing should not be excessive or too forced, and should be done between or after exercises, etc. are all neglected by the general public. If the method of deep breathing is wrong, the damage to the body is no less than that of dumbbell exercises. Although we have not heard of anyone who died of acute pneumonia in the short term due to improper deep breathing, many effective and appropriate exercises are often mistakenly criticized as foolish or harmful methods because of this.</p>
<p>Mr. Chengbo quoted the words of many famous Chinese and foreign physical educators to advise his younger brother. I believe that these famous Chinese and foreign physical educators would never regard dumbbell exercises and chest expander exercises as bloodless, foolish sporting methods!</p>
<p>If one only engages in exercise while neglecting other extremely important elements of health, the result will not only be useless but also harmful, even if the exercise is done properly. However, the general public does not have this understanding and completely attributes the harm caused by this to exercise.</p>
<p>Mr. Chengbo also said, "The 'hard work' method of Europeans and Americans has been criticized by many thoughtful people." But I wonder if Mr. Chengbo knows that dumbbell, chest expander, and weightlifting exercises have also been supported by many famous physical educators, doctors, and proponents of natural therapies. The reasons I mentioned above are the main reasons for their support. I would also like to know Mr. Chengbo's so-called "thoughtful people's" reasons for criticizing the "hard work" method of Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chengbo's reason for "crying out loudly in grief after the death of his younger brother, hoping that the enthusiastic physical educators and doctors in society will unanimously condemn this harmful and foolish method" is based on the fact that his younger brother, who practiced this "bloodless, foolish sporting method" that he condemned, died of acute pneumonia within a short period of twelve days. I wonder if there are any other reasons. April 7, Year 28.</p>

<h3 id="e63">China's Tea Exports Greatly Reduced After the War Compared to Before <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Tea is a famous product of China, sold to various countries for about 40 to 50 million yuan annually. Its quality is good, and its product is excellent, far superior to those of European, American, British, and Japanese countries. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, with the successive fall of important Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, exports have been greatly reduced compared to before. According to an investigation, in January 1938, the quantity of Chinese tea transported to foreign countries was still 17,631 dan, worth approximately 1,401,874 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to Hong Kong was 12,032 dan, worth 978,794 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to Morocco was 215 dan, worth 195,077 yuan in national currency. The amount transported to the Soviet Union was 297 dan, worth 26,633 yuan in national currency. However, as of February of this year, the total export volume has decreased to 7,689 dan, worth 651,682 yuan in national currency. Among them, black tea accounted for 216 dan, worth 147,131 yuan in national currency; other black tea accounted for 584 dan, worth 30,591 yuan; Xiaojian green tea accounted for 651 dan, worth 64,788 yuan; Xichun green tea accounted for 568 dan, worth 40,923 yuan; Liangqian green tea accounted for 1,667 dan, worth 152,550 yuan; other green tea accounted for 2,432 dan, worth 264,124 yuan; Wudao Ming tea accounted for 195 dan, worth 65,972 yuan; Mao tea accounted for 384 dan, worth 17,985 yuan. The largest amount of exports was transported to Hong Kong, accounting for 2,763 dan, worth 204,144 yuan. The second largest was Morocco, accounting for 1,506 dan, worth 144,170 yuan. The third largest was the Soviet Union, accounting for 372 dan, worth 30,023 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Path of Intellectuals <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Saif</p>
<p>Initially, when an intellectual begins to doubt himself, he will embark on a very dark path—that is possible.</p>
<p>Doubting oneself also includes the tendency not to be able to keep up with the evolution of the objective environment. Therefore, there is no strong force to support oneself; one does not seek and discover that strong force, and one becomes shaken.</p>
<p>Gorky, regarding the intellectuals before the revolution, said that they "can think so humbly": "They can live brightly between the ideology and the workers, or think of themselves as occupying the position of a harness between the coachman and the horse, or even occupying the position of a saddle in the middle of the rider's horse's back."</p>
<p>Then he said: "First of all, our intellectuals—are a labor force. They fear the muscles of the working masses from head to toe. This is not only because they have a chemical relationship of blood, but also because they closely and actively participate in the unified labor process."</p>
<p>The above is what Gorky said in a letter to the workers after Gorky met with representatives of the workers in Yaroslavl on September 20, 1933.</p>
<p>Currently, the contributions of Chinese intellectuals in the war are generally significant. Almost every intellectual has done their best. Whether on the front lines, behind enemy lines, or in the rear, they have always dedicated themselves to their country.</p>
<p>Now, let me record a conversation I had with salvation-seeking intellectuals in a remote small town one night.</p>
<p>"Now, because the school is approaching the exam date, all work has stopped..."</p>
<p>"So, what is your work like usually?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We organized reading groups...During charity sales, we mobilized students to participate, and we actually sold a lot..."</p>
<p>"How do the reading groups operate?"</p>
<p>"We study current affairs issues and try to publish some wall newspapers. We always want to enable all students to participate in the reading groups... But we don't want our reading group members to be just salvation experts. We want to become salvation workers!"</p>
<p>When the conversation ended, it was already very late. We talked a lot enthusiastically, but there was no conclusion.</p>
<p>That night, I just thought:</p>
<p>"They are living in 'struggle'!" Naturally, we want our intellectuals to be a labor force! Separating knowledge from action, or separating practice from theory, is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Do not forget life! Intellectuals must pay attention to the objects of their work at all times. Moreover, they must train themselves into unwavering and fearless warriors.</p>
<p>A warrior does not necessarily hold a gun. A pen, plus a correct worldview, is also a tool with the effectiveness of a bayonet when charging!</p>
<p>We need to further emphasize the struggle consciousness of intellectuals.</p>
<p>Looking at the general phenomenon, although our intellectuals are undertaking the mission of the times arduously; in order to ensure the accelerated completion of the mission, in order to ensure the perfect completion of the mission, our intellectuals should constantly struggle against reactionary forces!</p>
<p>On the one hand: Compromisers, pessimists, negative, timid, begging for surrender to the enemy everywhere, and spreading all kinds of terrifying and desperate atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the enthusiasm of the masses, the indomitable spirit, the caring desires, and the heroic advance.</p>
<p>However, our intellectuals must not only give the former a fatal and merciless blow, but also learn from the latter, and at the same time, advance bravely with the masses. From them, our intellectuals will gain "firmness."</p>
<p>How do plants absorb nourishment from the soil? Why do plants need the sun? How should our intellectuals avoid becoming anemic?</p>
<p>Advance! Choose our path! Study how to advance on our path!</p>
<p>China is in such a great era, our intellectuals should transform from the position of "horse" and "saddle" to a newer position:</p>

<h3 id="e65">Outside the Window <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Li Dan</p>
<p>Wandering outside the window, I am full of envy for the window. Imagine looking out from the window at the distant mountains and rivers, with a white sail floating quietly across the sea. What an intoxicating picture for the person inside the window!</p>
<p>However, in this corner of life's barrier, the window has proven to be something that is not meant for me, although I once pursued it passionately.</p>
<p>Some people think that the window is the eye of the house. A house without a window is like a blind person. And I live a blind life all year round. Although God did not give me a pair of eyes less when he created me, in this dark corner, it does not have the function of X-rays to see the world outside the partitions.</p>
<p>When fate sent me to this place, I saw dense layers of buildings from the seaside, with tempting windows shining above. I secretly rejoiced, thinking that I could live in this world with many windows. But after a year of experience, I realized that in this world with many windows, there are still many people like me who are excluded from the windows and live a blind life.</p>
<p>I have tried several times to find a window, but the fact tells me that in this world of windows, society is divided into two classes in a distorted way: one with windows and one without windows. Those with windows live inside the windows, and those without windows are excluded outside the windows. The window is the gap that divides the two classes, and there is no mixing allowed. Therefore, I had to return to the wall cage outside the window, and from then on, I no longer dared to have any illusions.</p>
<p>Once I went to visit a friend in the windowed class. To my surprise, the inside of the window was as dark as my wall cage, because all the windows were covered with cloth strips. I asked him why? He gave two reasons: the first was because he wanted to avoid the dust on the street and the strong sunlight, so he would rather have the room a little darker; the second was because he was afraid that people outside would see things he didn't want them to see, so he covered it with curtains, preferring not to be able to look out. Only then did I realize that the window is not something that is permanently worshipped, and there are enviable points in this dark wall cage: although noise cannot be completely avoided, sunlight has never been able to penetrate even an inch; although I seem to be lacking eyes, I will not be made someone else's eyes, and I don't even glance at myself and have nothing I don't want people to see.</p>
<p>The window began to waver in my ideal from then on.</p>
<p>Recently in Guilin, I saw many schools built in caves. Groups of children carried their bedding and schoolbags to the caves to attend classes every day. Under the continuous bombing of enemy planes, they were able to work harder and strive harder. Of course, those dark caves do not have windows, but they get knowledge and grow up healthy under the stone walls. Of course, they live in a corner of life's barrier not far from the window, but from outside the window, they recognize life's Dharma. The story of Bodhidharma realizing the profound meaning after facing the wall for nine years, although not entirely credible, does not hint that there is also a great existence in the dark corner. Light does not rely on external sources, but depends on self-emission.</p>
<p>From then on, I no longer coveted a window. I still live in the wall cage outside the window. Although the four walls have no windows, the window is open in my heart.</p>
<p>When I stroll on the street, from outside the window, I have not noticed whether there are things inside the window that people do not want to see, but the hanging window curtain has already told me what mission I am carrying.</p>

<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Comrade, I still have to bear the same kind of work to compensate for my failure this time. But, the responsibility for this failure..."</p>
<p>She was impatient with the long wait, and her cleverness again prompted her to do the second experiment:</p>
<p>"Are you letting me go? Or are you taking my corpse with you? You have to decide quickly, immediately, immediately!"</p>
<p>She never takes risks, only risky experiments, because she is weak. However, she did not think that this experiment inspired a kind of wisdom in him:</p>
<p>"Yes, I will take your corpse with me. I will bury your corpse in an uninhabited place nearby. I can walk back casually, and then still ask your family for money. Besides me and my comrades, only your corpse will know that your family redeemed it, right?"</p>
<p>So, he decided to complete his responsibility and work with her blood: although, she was innocent.</p>
<p>He thought of responsibility, work, he was happy, happy with success. But, he saw her, he was sad, perhaps even sadder than failure. (32)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Song of Jiangmen <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>Jiangmen,</p>
<p>I have gazed at you in the moonlight of spring,</p>
<p>Looking down at the long river that nurtures your soul,</p>
<p>Listening quietly to the peaceful hymn of the waves;</p>
<p>I drank a toast to you,</p>
<p>Wishing you a bright future!</p>
<p>But, this spring,</p>
<p>Jiangmen,</p>
<p>I heard you calling in the darkness:</p>
<p>"My masters,</p>
<p>Come quickly and save me,</p>
<p>Cut off the evil hand of the invaders!"</p>
<p>You aroused the fires of resistance;</p>
<p>You watched countless warriors lie down to defend you,</p>
<p>And watched the blood of the enemy defile the pure land,</p>
<p>But you no longer rely on a humble and submissive peace,</p>
<p>But began to sing of war,</p>
<p>To sing of the peace that will be rebuilt in war.</p>
<h3 id="e68">At Maojintai (Continued) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Dun Sheng</p>
<p>——Two of the Frontline Grass Sketches</p>
<p>"Brothers," he finally comforted us, "Let's do it! It's not difficult to drive out these crazy beasts. The days of struggle are long. Don't be arrogant about small victories, and don't be discouraged by major setbacks. There will always be a day when we can destroy these beasts and achieve the final victory for our nation."</p>
<p>The millet was washed, and the pot began to hum and whistle.</p>
<p>The wind outside the window made the branches rustle, and the sun was setting dimly...</p>
<p>Red-tasseled spears were stuck in the ground, and sentry posts were set up at the entrance and in the village outskirts. The entire Maojintai was so desolate that there was not a sound of dogs barking or chickens crowing, only the howling wind blowing down from the wild mountain tops, whoosh—whoosh.</p>
<p>The hillside bulged with a round mound. This mountain depression was composed of several such mounds, and the silent houses were threatened by the howling wind, lying prostrate at the foot of the hills.</p>
<p>The branches of the trees swayed back and forth in the wind——————</p>
<p>In the distant plains, there were many shadowy villages, and the small river shimmered like a white ribbon, wrinkled by the wind. The wilderness was gloomy, and a patch of trees or a field of locust grass looked like shadowy spots.</p>
<p>The people in the nearby villages had all fled, according to the farmer (let's call him a farmer for now), and had moved into Dinghu Mountain to live.</p>
<p>"Why are the mountain people also fleeing?"</p>
<p>"The mountains here are small. There are mountains in the mountains that are dozens of times larger than these."</p>
<p>Putu, putu... The rice in the pot began to boil. He hurriedly lifted the round mat that covered the pot's mouth, and a burst of steam rushed up, and the thin rice porridge in the pot bubbled.</p>
<p>The farmer stirred the pot with a long-handled coconut shell spoon, and a warm aroma of rice rushed into our nostrils.</p>
<p>"Eat, brothers. The porridge is hot."</p>
<p>However, there were not enough bowls to distribute, so everyone used their own coconut shells to hold the porridge, and broke sorghum stalks to make chopsticks. In this way, we finished a large pot of porridge, and everyone's faces revealed a rosy color, as if they had become healthier.</p>
<p>That night, our team camped in this small mountain village, opened the doors of the uninhabited houses, and went inside to sleep. The brothers on guard in the village outskirts and on the hillside looked out at the dark earth mounds and village shadows in the hillside plains.</p>
<p>The rocks on the hillside were smoothed by the rain, and the stars in the sky trembled in the wind.</p>
<p>Maojintai was in a dry mountain depression. The clear stream in the gully flowed day and night, and the spring water shooting down from the cracks in the stone walls splashed against the rocks below. The old locust trees leaned over the gully bank, sighing in the wind.</p>
<p>The alert brothers, not to mention their clothes, shoes, and leggings, held their guns in their arms or pressed them under their bodies, ready to strike at any moment if anything unusual happened.</p>
<p>The night grew deeper, and the houses, walls, trees, and hills were as dark as fortresses. The wind gradually stopped sweeping, and there was not a single wisp of cloud in the sky, revealing thousands upon thousands of stars. In the silent night, a voice suddenly rang out: "Password!"</p>
<p>This shout startled the night's tranquility.</p>
<p>A burst of knocking on the door shook the cold, silent night, followed by several shouts: "Open the door, comrades, it's me..."</p>
<p>The voice was very familiar. It was the farmer who had cooked porridge for us during the day.</p>
<p>The door was opened, and the farmer walked in, followed by a group of people with red-tasseled spears, wooden sticks, and long knives.</p>
<p>"We are all comrades," the farmer said, pointing to the group of people. "They have just come out of the deep mountains. Some are farmers who till the land, some are boatmen who pole boats – all prepared to sabotage the enemy's work —"</p>
<p>"Oh—"</p>
<p>We gave them a solemn salute, and everyone became comrades-in-arms in the shadows.</p>
<p>These filthy people with tangled hair all carried heroic appearances, swaying in the darkness.</p>
<p>A young comrade with a red-tasseled spear, shaking his red-tasseled spear, sang in a low voice:</p>
<p>We!</p>
<p>Young warriors,</p>
<p>Trampled all over Dinghu Mountain,</p>
<p>Walked through the thorny swamps, jungles,</p>
<p>For the motherland,</p>
<p>And also for our:</p>
<p>Villages,</p>
<p>Fields.</p>
<p>... (The End)</p>
