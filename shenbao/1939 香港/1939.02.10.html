<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本龐大軍事預算的展望</h3>
<p>最近路透社東京通訊告訴我們：日本內閣已經編好本年度海陸軍費特別預算案，將於二月中旬提交國會審核；只軍費全部卽已超過七十二萬五千三百萬日元。表面上看來，這個數目算已相當龐大，但其中尙包含着欺騙與弱點在焉。這個軍費預算，第一不足在華駐兵之用；第二沒有餘剩可以用於對蘇同時作戰；第三準備與英美抗爭，擴大造艦計畫，更是不可想像，日本軍閥的鬱悶亦云苦矣！茲略爲剖述於下：</p>
<p>先自在華陸軍之費用剖述看，日本陸軍省在垂軍費是以預算及特別費之項目表出的，其數目約爲四十九億元。在此數目中還須減去兩方面費用：其一是上年度還有二三兩個月份經費無着，須取給於本年度預算：其二滿洲事件費，以前列在經常預算中，本年度則歸入特別預算項下。卽令這兩點不加考慮，其總額也不足目前陸軍在我國中央部作戰之用。日本駐我國本部陸軍總數，最低限度估定爲一百萬人，每一人一日的費用據一般的估計，甲午戰當時爲八角，日俄戰當時爲二元四角，日德之役爲三元六角，現在比日德之役約當增至五倍，約爲十七元五角，按此單位計算，日本全年陸軍軍費當在六十三億八千元以上，本年度表面預算卽已不足十四億元，何况隨戰塲之擴大，此後的需要當不只上列最低數的單位呢！這是日本軍費預算的第一個脆弱。</p>
<p>其次，日本此次軍事預算案中，自誇包括準備同時對中蘇作戰費用，在其支出項下包括（一）保持在華日軍的力量；（二）增加駐在僞滿日軍之力量；（三）擴張空軍勢力；及（四）改良日本的軍需。這是極大的扯謊，對其議會，政黨及民衆欺騙而已。日本在中國本部作戰的軍隊最低限度估計爲一百萬，作戰範圍是在日益擴大，這個膠着的數目絕對不能減少，則欲應付蘇聯邊境的軍隊勢須再由國內抽調，則其「出征」兵數增加而其軍費當然隨之增加。不知日本軍閥將如何包括準備對蘇作戰軍費於本年度特別預算內？</p>
<p>再次，日本今年度軍費預算案中最脆弱的一環，是海軍軍費預算。其總數只有十八億五千多萬元，比之上年度的十七億二千萬元，只有極微的增加；其經常費部分反爲减少二千七百萬元。其預備費及特別費雖有多少增加，但不足以言擴張海軍，建設新海軍根據地以與英美在太平洋上抗爭。誠如日本海相米內所言，「英美兩國現正積極擴軍，日本如欲控制附近洋面，不得不有大規模之造艦計劃。」再如前此日本海軍省所頒佈小册子所言，英美在太平洋上的海軍設備將成爲壓倒的力量，並對日本取包圍的情勢，則日本本年度區區十二億元預備費及特別費預算，實離所謂造艦計劃及擴張海軍之如意算盤非常遙遠。微聞日本海軍一來因與陸軍爭功，二來因恐懼英美海軍之壓迫，極力主張使太平洋海軍據根地健强化，第一步要佔據華南沿海各據點，但因軍費及佔領費關係遲遲莫决，今觀日本海軍軍費之如此薄弱，侵略者將只能望洋興歎而已。德國弗朗克府日報駐東京記者評日本侵華事爲「鞭長莫及」，實含有深意，其力量不但「莫及於中國內地，並且「莫及」於沿海。侵略者的末路竟慘至如此程度！</p>
<p>然而日本財政危機的核心還在於歲入方面，日本國民對此龐大財政的負担，增加租稅旣無力量，推銷公債更無辦法，日本國民一年所得額最高估計爲一百六十億元，只本年度軍費負担卽去了約近半數。其國民生活將如何慘苦，固不在瘋狂侵略者的眼下，但其財政之瀕於破產，不知此輩將如何應付呢？</p>
<h3>日方攫奪華中經濟全貌</h3>
<p>— 顧孝慧</p>
<p>日本現在華中佔領區域內，積極進行經濟侵略工作，組織所謂『華中振興株式會社」，以「一業一公司」爲對象，成立各子公司，對華中無論農產，礦產，工業，交通，電氣，等事業，加以龍斷，圖在對華方面，攫奪戰區內整個經濟權力，將外方面，在擯除國際在華的利益；對它們自己，則在壓榨民間經濟，推展到中國來，總之一句，擬在榨取佔領區內的經濟，以補日本財政上的缺陷，而謀遂行其對華長期戰爭，並將在中國的日軍給養，完全要出諸中國人的身上，這可於最近板垣答復議員的言辭中見之。</p>
<p>筆者現將日方在華中經濟侵略的方式，各種侵峪機關的組織，和華中各業被佔情形，根據記者調査所得，和中英日文報紙的記載，寫下這一篇東西，讓大家看看日方經濟侵略華中的來龍去脈，要使我國人知道這稱强占硬覇的行動，我們只要不點頭，無論他怎樣，終有光復舊物之一日。</p>
<p>一·所謂「華中振與公司」（？）</p>
<p>在東三省，我們曉得日本曾有着一個所謂「滿　會社」，日本人自己說它是　大陸的急先鋒。一九一八以後，幾年來關外的各種經濟權，全已占在它的手中。八一三以後，日本又以這一種政策，在去年十一月七日，成立了兩個新的會社，一個是對華北的所謂「華北發展株式會社一，一個卽是對華中的所謂「華中振興株式會社」，這兩倘組織，和滿鐵一樣是日政府認爲的「國策公司」。本文所說的單就「華中振興公司」去說。</p>
<p>該「華中振興公司」，是根據日政府去年四月二十八日第七十三屆日本國會通過而設立的。去年十一月七日在東京成立以後，總公司據說設於上海，（但尙未見實現），該公司的資本爲一億日圓，由日本政府及民間各負半數凑成，其第一次收入股本爲三千一百三十八萬二千三百四十四圓，其中分：</p>
<p>日本政府——一八，八八二，三四四日元</p>
<p>實物折合—七，六四〇，〇〇〇日元</p>
<p>現金—一一，二四二，三四四日元</p>
<p>民間股份——一二，五〇〇，〇〇〇〇日元</p>
<p>但是說也可憐，這民間資金，是經過了四個月的長時明，分做十萬股，募得而來，參加的股東，達九千七百七十人之多。而出的錢，也只有一子二百多萬。</p>
<p>該公司的組織、除了許多子公司以外，分三課一所，如下：</p>
<p>上海總社</p>
<p>（子公司</p>
<p>）總務課</p>
<p>八商務課</p>
<p>）業務調査課</p>
<p>（東京分所</p>
<p>重要的負責人，總裁係由日政府任命，爲兒玉謙次，這老頭，就是戰前所謂中日貿易協會的日方會長。我們總還記得幾年前到上海來在國際飯店杯酒聯歡，高唱中日經濟合作的事情吧！現在的狐狸尾巴顯出來，原來所謂「合作」是這樣的合作，凡是迷着做中日經濟合作夢的人們，也應該覺醒了。如今且將這公司各重要的負責人列下：</p>
<p>總裁　兒玉謙次　（前正金銀行總經理）</p>
<p>副總裁　平澤要　（前遞信省次官）</p>
<p>理事　金井淸　（前滿鐵會社專員）</p>
<p>園田三郞　（前正金銀行外國課長）</p>
<p>油谷恭一　（前中日實業協會理事）</p>
<p>該公司的成立，上面巳經說過，實際是一個壓榨日本民資，和代表日政府經濟侵華的總機關，而由其所屬的子公司實施侵略。子公司的設立，爲一業一公司，無論何業，都由這一業的公司去統制，其目的是要把住整個的華中工商業樞紐，排斥歐美在華的利益，使中國成爲它經濟的附膺，有如古代的農奴。永遠不能踏進現代工業的門徑。</p>
<p>關於公司控制各業的詳情，寫在後面，現在再來說該公司主腦兒玉謙次的活動，</p>
<p>二·兒玉謙次來華的活動</p>
<p>兒玉謙次於該『華中振興公司』成立後，在東京曾對路透社記者發表談話，欲誘致英美在它的控制區域內去投資，因此否認統制和獨佔，第一，玉兒說『該公司不受陸軍的支配，係完全商業性質。』這一句全是謊話，明明是日本對華的『國策公司』之一，兒玉自己是由日政府任命的，據東京方面自己所說，日政府對該公司之監督權，有取銷該會社决議之權，有委任及解除該會社負責人之權，並在國防或其他必要上，得頒發各種必要命令云云，於此足見兒玉所說全係假話，實際這公司是日政府的代表，裏面的負責人，是軍閥的走卒。第二，它說『該公司禾有壟斷之意，』更完全是哄人瞎說，遠看『滿鐵』在東北，到現在已完全排斥整個國際利權于『滿洲』，近着華北，棉花的統制，名義上是偽組織，實際上還不是這所謂「華北開發公司」。再如在上海與內河的航路，自日本的「內河輪船公司」成立以來，就被完全壟斷。「內河輪船公司」，卽是這公司的子公司，外商航輪果也會向日方交涉通行證，航行內河而不可得，其他各業正多着，難道還不足證明他的統制嗎？同時日方報紙，無不承認此後以統制中國工商業爲中心的政策的。第三，兒玉又說：「上海繁榮多了，日人商業隨之發達，而外人商業亦未有獨不擴張之理，』這就是它們企圖引誘圖美來華中投資，完成它的發展陰謀。但是各方對兒玉的談話，都澳然置之，它就在如此狀况下離開東京釗上海來活動。</p>
<p>兒玉于去年十一月二十六日乘宮崎丸到上海，同時偕來的，有該公司副總裁平澤，及理事等，會在虹口與偽方舉行所謂僞日經濟合作辦法，包括。</p>
<p>（一）擴展振典公司的方策，</p>
<p>（二）設立日華銀行。</p>
<p>（三）發行僞鈔。</p>
<p>（四）推行軍用票。</p>
<p>（五）其他統制事宜。</p>
<p>十一月三十日由滬去南京，與日軍最高指揮商討協作辦法；並在南京召集江蘇，浙江，安徽三省僞省長開會，商談它們所謂的「合作』辦法，實際上是叫幾個塊儡來詢問一聲，你那裏有什麽東西可供　奪罷了，兒玉據說是長川住於上海，但是它希圖設立日華銀，行和發行僞鈔的計劃，因中外各銀行的正義拒絕，它的計劃是失敗了，推行軍用票呢，在它到了南京之後，已經與日方商妥，已於去年十一月三十日起實行，那即是在佔據區發行新軍用票，代替銀行鈔票的以廢紙購買貨物的攫奪政策。</p>
<p>三·各種統制公司的設立</p>
<p>關於日方統制各業，所設立的各種子公司，在「華中振興公司」尙未成立以前，和兒玉未來上海以前，已經在日軍的「囑托」設立了不少的公司，後來「振與公司」成立了，各公司就是它的子公司了，兒玉來華以後，又新成立了好幾個。</p>

<p>至於其他在華中方面巳被控制，而尙未有成立機關的，有如（一）鐵道，京滬，滬杭，蘇嘉，江南等鐵路，由日本軍用鐵道科，及日本鐵道部，滿鐵會社等所派的工程師修復中，將由「華中振興公司」營業。（二）煤礦，圖採淮南煤礦，長興煤礦等，中與煤已被開始運日。（三）無綫電廣播事業，已成立有「大上海」，「大東」，圖利用僞組織統制上海華商電台。（四）烟草有東洋葉烟葉會社，東亞煙草公司，共盛煙公司等，攫奪華商捲煙廠。（五一農產方面，均被在內地設立機關，統制收買，如棉花，由日商在華紗廠協會聯台會與漢奸機關市民協會，在上海設立統制機關，並向日軍部領取採辦證後，卽派員在各縣設立辦事處，統制收買，禁止『私買賣』，各華商紗廠在內地所設的收花處，均已被迫撤退。如米、在松江，無錫，常熟，蘇州，等處收買，裝運出口，已不下數百萬担。（六）造船業日方三菱重工業公司，攫奪海軍部江南造船所修理軍艦，又占用三北鴻昌台興等三廠的機件。日軍占領了浦東老公茂定海橋大中華兩廠，日淸占用了財利龍昌恒昌祥鴻祥與招商內河等五廠機器。（七）水泥，紡織，麵粉等，均被日方在日軍策動下分別攫奪。</p>
<p>四·與日商公司的聯繫</p>
<p>上面所述的各子公司，這是直接對華攫奪的機關，它們聽命于這『國策公司』的『華中振興公司』，各子公司的組織，『華中振興公司』是代表日官方的，當然參加份子，其餘是集台日商共同組織而成，以攫奪的華力產業、供其榨取，這些上面已經說過，現爲明瞭起見，再作一表在下面：</p>
<p>五，被攫奪的各種產業</p>
<p>戰前，在華中的華商紗廠，約有紡錠一百三十八萬錘布機一萬四千七百臺，目前已被日方佔據利用者，約有錠子六十萬錘，布機五千三百臺，工廠共有三十七家，</p>
<p>水泥廠的被攫奪者，根據申報商業新聞所載，全國十家華商水泥廠，今僅留一家在華商手中，在日方方領區內的九家，已全被攫取、其中在華北有三家，在華南有二家，華中方面有四家。</p>
<p>華中爲蠶絲產地，日有覬覦染指已久，過去於求之不得之下，曾屢以劣質蠶絲種銷售與我國，圖加以危害。八一三後，在華中日軍佔領區域內的絲繭產區，如上海。無錫，杭州，蘇州，嘉興，湖州，海寗，德淸等地的絲廠，盡被佔據，自所謂『華中蠶公司』成立後，全部皆田其侵佔經營，車的遭受佔據者，上海三家，絲車七百零八部，無錫九家，絲車二千五百五十四部，蘇州十九家，車三千六百五十六部，杭嘉湖海寗等二十二家，車四千零三十部。達一萬零九　四十八部，都五十餘家。</p>
<p>同時「華中蠶公司」並佔據繭行及蠶種製造場，在江蘇省淪陷區內者，計有二百十四家，其中吳縣二十六所。無錫九十九所，常熟一所，吳江二所，崑山一所，太倉一所，江陰十九所，武進二十所，宜興八所，金壇三所，丹場十所，溧陽十所，溧水一所，丹徒一所，句客一所，揚中五所，江那二所。</p>
<p>華中麵粉廠的遭受日方侵佔開工後，上海市區有福新第三廠等四家，被日方三升及三菱合辦的一日本製粉會社」所侵佔　營。無錫有福新，茂新，廣豐，廣勤，九豐等五家，其中化豐一家，由日商吉田號佔營外，餘大都爲「日本製　會社一佔營，南京有揚子江麵粉廠，被日人佐籐貢一所佔營。</p>
<p>華中游擊區內的捲烟市場，已完全爲日方所操縱，它藉軍事勢力，禁止華商捲烟，及央商捲烟運入內地，而以由皖省方面攏斷得來的烟草，和，奪佔領區內的華商捲烟廠，覇佔開工，又不須繳　統稅，粗製濫造的劣貨，向內地傾銷，於此市塲盡被佔據。</p>
<p>在上海南市，浦東，閘北，楊樹浦等處的造紙廠，原有十餘家，自華軍西撤以後，工廠大　被日方佔據，旋日方企圖利誘各該廠當局與日方合作，開工復業，但各廠方面，均以大義所在，决不惜犧牲小我，一致拒絕，日方見利誘未着，乃覇佔全部廠屋機器，凖備開工。</p>
<p>此外尙有被日方覇佔的工廠，已見本報商業新聞『中國商業一篇傷心史」（見上年十二月二十七日本報）中，並有許多工廠來函聲明並未與日方台作，完全是掠奪無疑了。</p>
<p>六，末了一點感想</p>
<p>筆者將現在搜獲的材料，把到　東酉寫完了，當然我們是看見了大的民族工業，遭受掠奪，是莫可諱言的損失：我們又看見了對方的末來的陰謀，在他們所謂「華中振典公旬」以內。　我們實用不到如何的恐怖，我們要看它是否有那麽能力？且看這「華中振典公司」的資本，名爲一萬萬日元，第一期所收的僅有三千一百三十八萬二千三百四十四元，除了日政府勉强的出了一千八百八十八萬二千三百四十四元，（現金亦僅一千一百二十四萬二千三百四十四元）以外，其餘的民股僅一千二百五十萬元、尙且是經過了四個月的長時期，分作十萬股，而在九千七百七十個人中　得而來，這是確確實實毫無虛僞的事實，足證他們民衆對此，實是不感興趣。况且許多事務的在華發展，對它們國內的工業非維無益，也有反而遭受到影嚮的，巳經有發現的。因此我們要看透了這一點，希望我各產業當局要切實履行，（一）硬　頭皮，忍痛犧牲到底，（二）决不受利誘威脅，與日偽方面合作。如此，我們看對方有何辦法，而諸君目　所被佔的產業，待最後勝利來臨之日，亦可完壁歸趙了。</p>
<p>固然，我們也曾看見過力持大義，堅拒「合作」的廠主，（道裏我要提示一個，如蘇州大隆鐵廠及蘇綸紗廠的廠主嚴慶祥，它遭受日方利誘不成。加以逮捕威脅，但結果它仍是堅拒而到西南去，這是一個代表。）但我們也曾看見有甘受利用與對方合作的很多，如無錫的絲廠，卽是一例。（這裏記者也舉一個例子，卽全國有名的南通某紗廠，竟甘心與日的合作下開工，它屋頂上竟　着太陽和五色旂，每月以數十萬供給對方，筆者有一次去訪問該廠的眞相的時候，該廠在上海的某代表竟亦默認。據說：該廠是抵與德商的　那麽爲什麽不把他遷移呢？爲什該要供給某方以巨欵呢？那人搖搖頭笑笑，似乎表示：第一點手續太困難了，第二點因爲還想發財呀。）</p>
<p>除了以上的行動以外，還要出以積極的行動，這我們希望於游擊區內軍政組織了。我們要以破壞工作，如在山西的礦產一樣，使為無法開採，這機破壞工作並非要一定如何重大，卽是要設法讓它無法開工和發掘就是了。要使對方一方面自己是沒有能力，又不能利用人家，一方面困難百出，如此，看它抓到了，又有什麽辦法？（完）</p>

<h3>我政界人士談　當前抗戰形勢</h3>
<p>【路透社重慶九日電】此間中國政界人士、昨日向路透社訪員、論述中國政府當前之軍事、政治、經濟、社會情况、鄭重申明、謂</p>
<p>重申抗戰決心</p>
<p>中日出不能有何直接和平談判、唯有召集類似　二次華盛頓會議之遠東國際會議、方能解决現有之中日衝突、彼等相信、日木甚欲結束現有戰事、惟日方必堅持戰勝者之條件、而中國對此條件永不能接受之、同時中國方面所提之條件、日本亦當不願加以接受、故預料日本將「再作史大之進攻、然後再準備談判和平、以為如此方可獲得較　之和平條件」、　×兵無能為力</p>
<p>近數週來、陜西、鄂西、粵南等處、戰訊頻傳、然實未有何重大軍事發展、據華方可靠消息、日軍曾暗自長江一帶抽撤大批軍隊、而漢口、九江、上海、杭州及其他各處日軍、亦紛紛撤調、同時華南日軍、聞亦撤去大部、華軍司令部頃認為日軍并無在湘、鄂、贛或桂各省採取新攻勢之傾向、目下日軍在華活動、似有圖鄭州之企圖、其目的顯在西窺潼關、以便侵入陝西西安、此項活動并無如何軍事效果、因日人今後之活動、將純為增强政治作用也、唯此項活動前途之影響、則額為此間所重視耳、</p>
<p>歐局前途影響</p>
<p>同時一般以為目下戰事前途、大部　　歐局而轉移、如歐洲發生戰事、英法均操勝算、則中國亦必績極反攻、以自力求得最後　利、反之、如歐洲妥協、則國際壓力或將逼中日雙方以談判方式終止戰爭、發言者續稱、今日國際情勢之發展、己破壞國際貿易之一切共同原則、倫敦經濟界雖在各方反對之下、仍主張對華自由貿易、中國目下僅能與外國作交換留易、此即因中國僅能以國貨往易外國之軍火也、</p>
<p>國內一般情況</p>
<p>述及中國經濟情形、該方面宣稱、目下戰事之結果、并未使之有何劇烈改變、中國人民已縮小其經濟需要、而以土產供應之矣、同時中日戰事亦未使中國社會有何劇烈改愛、資產　級及智識份子仍為政府執權者、勞動農工則仍為軍隊中堅、蘇聯目下之援華、親已使蘇聯地位增强、唯執政權之智識份千、則堅决認為，中國如欲建立永久和平及復興大計、與英美合作、實為必要、據路透社記者觀察、共產黨不論在地位及權力上、尚談不到與於國民黨對抗云</p>

<h3>走上博增前綫</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>—返惠記行之八—</p>
<p>一月九日在寒風微雨中走過了羅，晚上投宿在××寺裏。××寺本是羅浮五大名寺之一，長松修竹，碧水殘荷，風景很佳。現在是果江第一游擊大隊的駐地，長松碧水間都站着荷槍實彈的戰士們，不覺名山古寺也武裝起來了。</p>
<p>第一浙擊大隊不是正規軍。本是自衛團的集訓隊伍。但于博羅淪陷期中，在響水一帶，以英勇强悍負着盛名，具有特殊的戰蹟，現在才調來這裏負担前線的　戒任務。全隊的戰士都是地道的農民，碩大的臂膀，俊挺的身村和古銅色的皮膚，構成一個典型的游擊隊員。正如他的大隊長陳仕南君所說，他雖然不諳熟步兵操典，可是却有游擊戰的豐富作戰經騐，他們放槍時不知道多少咪達，祗把×人當做一隻山猪，用打山猪的眼力和技巧，在射程之內一經放槍，無有不倒。所以×人聽到了近距雕的擔聲，英不驚得沒命的跑，永不敢復至。這是一段游擊隊中的美　。</p>
<p>我軍在博增邊區一綫的佈置，是緊握住東江和省道公路，自××以迄×××，向增城之×造成一道弧形的包團綫，由東江別動隊副司令梁柱指揮。指揮部設在××墟附近的小村中。現在梁副司令未到，由謝總隊附代理。次天的中午，記者趕着往訪，在一家淸幽的村舍裏曾見了謝總隊附。大家已是老友，現又在砲火的前綫上握着久疏的手，自更增加愉快和興奮的了。</p>
<p>我們　雜的漫談了一刻，謝總隊附立刻偕著記者和一位譚參謀，携了地圖，跑上附近的山崗，給記者指示前線的形勢。</p>
<p>博增邊區却是一個很有利的游擊地區。荔枝坳封鎖於前，我軍居高臨下，易於出擊：而×人則由下仰上，難於進攻。萬一卽使×人能够憑藉巨量的空軍掩護通過了荔枝　，但羅浮山脈防衛於側，必遭受我活躍於羅浮山中的游擊隊不斷出擊，加以整部鐵滅。事實上維浮山的每個峯巒，正游擊隊的天然巢穴。我們看着高低起伏的林壑　、　游擊隊員們，就記者也不住的</p>
<p>同</p>
<p>東江全線來說，博增和增龍（門）兩點，可以互為椅角，直拊增城之背。和石龍相隔東扛，一衣帶水，運用得宜，處處均能策應莞實的行動。因了地位的重要，配合增龍，莞實的反攻，我軍曾數度斜出荔枝坳向增城襲擊。×人現在把哨兵撤退至堆江橋邊，并得荔枝拗左面的公路毀　，埋設地雷，防止我軍的挺進。在我大舉反攻的前夜，可見×人的心慌兵薄了。</p>
<p>走上了前綫，每天每小時都可以看到低飛偵察的×機和隆隆然×人所發的「定心砲」——這是士兵們贈給×人的流行名詞。為避免被發現了目標，前方的隊伍多在蔗地或松林間活躍着。我們走過曲折的鄉道，會在許多枝婆娑的綠　叢中瞻仰鬍粗眉銳目的戰士們的面　，他們個個待着槍監視着羅浮山麓的平野。士氣非常的盛，半點沒有放鬆了他們自己的崗位。</p>

<h3>呻吟中的臺灣僑胞</h3>
<p>— 雋人</p>
<p>【本報特寫】未向覆者報導之先，得先把新聞的來源說明：這是一位姓石的　友從台灣帶囘來的。石君旅居台灣很久，在那裏營商，世代相傳，傳到我的朋友，石君也就離開祖國到那邊去。自從抗戰，最初石君不忍放棄他的生意，依然留着，等到最近，他遭爻了他所不能忍的痛苦，再也不能抵受了，才毅然批了他經營的商業，逃回祖國，到福州再來香港。他帶給我許多我們所關懷痛切的同胞們所通受着的痛苦的新聞，和台灣革命風雲的激盪情形。</p>
<p>我的朋友說：『我雖然己幸運的脫離了虎口，踏進國門，但我對於和我同遭苦難的同胞，依然備極關懷之切，他們仍在鉄蹄下呻吟着，亟盼國內的同胞予以援手，拯救他們逃出那可怕的陷阱？</p>
<p>『目前居留在台灣的華僑，尚有五萬七千餘人；他們的行動，簡直完全失了自由，吃盡了苦頭。日人警察到華僑的家裏檢查，直如家常便飯，一日之中，檢查數次的也有，傾箱倒篋，任意搜索，這就是所謂「嚴防反叛」之道，在路十走時，也同樣的要施以檢查，每一處交通要道，都是如此。華僑寢食不安，為了减少麻煩，許多人因此改穿洋服。因為如果穿了對襟衫，很容易就會被認作「支那人」的標記，十步一檢，百步一查，弄得你應付乏術，頭暈目眩，這還不打緊，如果為了一時不檢點，有時一些極檬小的事物，也要吃「莫須有」的罪名，那才是不寒而慄呢！</p>
<p>『自從抗戰爆發，我國駐台灣的領事館人員，也就跟着下旗歸國。這樣一來，幾萬華僑，就像失了靈魂的軀壳一樣，一切都沒有了全宰。中華會館被迫掛上了五色偽旗，靑天白日滿地紅的可愛的國旗，已再不能在華僑的眼前出現了。華僑處在這個境地，不但肉體上遭受痛苦，就是在精神上也因此而受了極大的激刺。</p>
<p>『目前台灣華僑失業的在七八千人以上，他們本都想回到祖國來，但是因為旅費無着，不得已，只有忍痛居留，他們的遭遇，想是國人所同情的罷！但是，更有一點要注意的，華僑中卽使有些有錢要回國的，（我就是其中之一）也要受到種種的剝削，方可成行。根據台灣日政府的禁令，每個人出口帶款不許超過一百元，逾額便要沒收；你想，一百元除了旅費之外，簡直己涓滴無　，所以稍有資產的華僑，縱然能够回到祖國，結果也還不是赤手空拳，損失　重。因此目前居留台灣的華僑，正處於進退維谷，去留都感困難之中。』</p>
<p>石君言下，唏吁嘆息。據說他這次回國，在台灣金錢的損失，在五萬元以上。現在囘到祖國，雖然一切都沒有了，但是能總到祖國抗戰的眞確消息，大聲說得一句由衷的括，總較比幾萬呻吟在水深火　中的僑胞好得多。談到台灣的近况，石君也給我們許多珍貴的新聞。他說：</p>
<p>『台灣華僑的處境雖然是苦了，但台灣人民却比我們更苦。自從戰事發生後，台灣徵兵已經許多次，年靑的大部都已被徵來華××，所以現在合灣市面靑年雖不至絕跡，但遇到一兩個也是很偶然的事，有了，也大都是殘廢之流，因此景况異常蕭條。至子被驅來華作戰的台灣人，死傷的很多，受傷者　囘台屬，源源不絕，但是政府對此很秘密，輕易不給人民知道，傷者運囘台灣後，都是關閉在傷兵醫院裏，不准外出，也不准親友探望。稍得自由的，僅是少數輕傷士兵，在街上往來，都是露出極悒鬰的樣子。傷兵醫院里的傷兵究竟有多少呢？數目是無從探悉，但知道每月給養所費不貲，人民有點不寒而慄了。</p>
<p>『這種浩大的給養經費，都是由人民每月認捐，負担很重，台灣民間所存的金屬，如金，銀，銅，鐵，錫之類，全部都被徵收一空，因此金銀舖相繼閉業，錫舖也在取締之列，工人失業，增加不少，皮鞋更絕對禁止製造，在我離開台灣之前一個月，台北某鞋店私製皮鞋一雙，給日人發覺了，結果判罰三千元，禁令之嚴，可見一斑。目前，在台灣市面上已看不見穿皮鞋的人，所有的皮鞋，都已發為軍用，皮鞋既告禁用，木屐大為流行，穿了洋服，也同樣的拖着木屐，可說是奇跡！台灣的金銀，都要送到銀行兌換紙幣，金戒子也沒有人再敢戴了，但是日政府尚恐其有遺漏，因此又舉行金銀登記，佈告通點通　，飭令民衆藏有金銀的，都要向政府登記。以便隨時徵用。</p>
<p>『民衆的献金，也是强制執行的，每家發錢筒一個，懸掛在室內，每個人都要按日投一定額的欵項到筒裏，月終由政府派員按戶點收，不能或缺。在負祖許多苛捐什稅之外，還要應付這種『强迫献金』！民竊財盡，難勝負担，叫苦連天，日本軍閥却是充耳無聞，那裏想像得到他們的苦况呢！</p>
<p>『人民的痛苦　深，反抗的念頭為損，所以目前台灣的××空氣，　常濃厚，台灣的革命黨也很活躍。同時日政府因為「嚴防反叛」，也戡密的戒備驚，因嫌疑而被捕的日有數起，但是台灣的××風雲，却依然在激邊中呢！』</p>

<h3>德日的間諜同盟（續完）</h3>
<p>後來至四月間，日本午唐又奉命赴法，協助大島推進工作。</p>
<p>午唐是海軍退伍軍人，現任昭和鋼廠廠長，他把日人團體送的寶劍献給希特勒後，便銷聲匿跡不見了，其實他正在克虜伯與德軍官舉行會議呢！</p>
<p>訪問結果，頗稱圓滿，不久便有特旅團赴德之舉，這些團員多是情報處軍官，一九三六年六月日本情報處實際上已遷至柏林了。在大島的辦公廳裏面，日特派團團員和尼古拉領導的德情報處代表，和不管部部長里賓特羅甫的代表潑的却博士開會討論，决定把全世界分為兩個間諜活動區。較大的區域由德間諜活動，小的則由日本間諜活動。</p>
<p>不過日本要求德國把蘇聯劃歸日本問諜活動範圍。當德答應了這個要求之後，大島大佐又向瓦特少校說：「如果我們負担全部的經費，你們是否願在美國活動呢？」</p>
<p>這突如其來的提議，使尼古拉少校躊躇起來，一九三四年以前，德國在蘇聯的軍事顧問，搜集相當充分的蘇聯資料，故德對蘇軍事實力情形，已有深切的認識。在美國方面，尼古拉擋案裏面僅有在歐戰時和平會議所收集的一些材料。德國對美國一向不大注意，故除了一個商業間諜組織專探刺企業上的秘密外，不曾做過探刺軍情的工作活動。</p>
<p>後來間諜的活動終於擴充到美國去了。</p>
<p>一九三七年德國許多間諜人員，都紛紛深入美國各地，大肆活動，同時日本便把它自己在美的間諜人員調到中國和東印度去了，故現在祗有紐約，支加哥，洛杉磯霍斯登，西雅圖和舊金山六個大城市還留有一部份日本朋諜在活動。</p>
<p>尼古拉在美國領導他的間諜工作，始終如一，擇定白蘭梅哈佛港做他的大本營，而以歐羅巴號輪船為傳遞信件的重要工具，由飛佛少校負責一切活動。</p>
<p>近來美國聯邦偵探局拘捕三男一女的嫌疑犯，都是大島，尼古拉間諜網的間接關係人物。他們是從塞佛斯基和坎特期工廠偷出材料供給日方，因此，他們也由日方津貼。</p>
<p>大島和瓦特對於這個日德同盟，始終嚴守秘密，知道內幕的很少，即當時德國外長牛賴特也亳無所聞。但不久之後却被蘇聯反間諜破獲了這陰謀，蘇聯反間諜組織有一支部，係著名間諜憶契漢所主持，在巴黎活動，在布爾果斯地方有一個日本特派團，如果誰得到關於蘇聯的資料便交給他們。蘇俄駐法大使波却金接到本國訓令把這件事向法外長台爾博斯提出照會，法參謀本部，不禁大驚，馬上在巴黎召集最高軍事會議，蘇俄陸軍參贊也出席向大會報告。</p>
<p>在東京和柏林一向保守秘密的間諜機關，終於陰謀暴露了。大島和瓦特以及其他人員，自然不免恐慌。但為對付法蘇兩國計，便不加掩飾，反用迅雷不及掩耳的主段，公開的擴大組織，說是為了對付共黨第三國際的，同時為要加强這組織的力量記見，便於一九三六年十一月二十六日由駐德大使武者小路和德外長牛頓特正式簽訂草約，掩飾了間諜同盟的眞面目。</p>
<p>在防共協定的後面，日德間諜同盟仍繼續存在着，現在日本對歐美的情報總機關還在柏林，就是德國情報司，同時德駐日大使館也成為德國軍情的總機關，德國在這裏獲得土肥原在他的區域裏，包括中國，婆羅洲，澳洲，紐西蘭和蘇俄遠東區，所探得的情報，日本情報工作經費，現每年增到一千二百萬元，這一筆巨額支出便是用來付給尼古拉領導下在美國做間諜的繼費用的。</p>
<p>柏林的日本大使館和東京的德國大使館與其說是外交活動的機關，無寧說是互換秘密軍情的交易所吧！一九三八年四月，這個間諜同盟創造人瓦特昇為德國駐日大使，大島也昇任日本駐德大使了。</p>
<p>兩們間諜首領在外交方面佔着至高無上的職權，還是現代歷史上罕見的事呢！（民譯自KEN十二月號）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>世界和平會議</h3>
<p>英首相張伯倫於前天（八日）在下院宣稱，「英國現正努力促求召開一世界和平會議，邀請各國參加，以解　有引起戰爭可能之一切經濟與政治問題」。在這遍地烽火之中，這和平之題的淸脆的呼聲，不知會不會打動侵略　王的心？</p>
<p>本釆，泯除干戈之爭於雍容會議之上，是世界愛護和平人士的衷心願望，而國際聯盟以及一切非戰條約等等，其所宣言標榜者，亦莫不集中於此，可惜自希特勒際遇非常，夤緣登台以來，新的世界大戰實際已經開始，重以和平民主各國偽善怯懦妥協政策的貽禍，使國際聯盟不能切實執行其職　，一切和平協定如非戰條約九國公約等悉被撕碎，而國聯機構以外的國際和平會議如西戰不干涉委會等，則竟在和平中立等面具之下，放縱法西斯侵略者為非作惡，卒有今日西戰激變之禍！</p>
<p>現在自羅斯福總統發表援助歐洲民主國家的談話以後，蘇聯首以打擊侵略者的對匈絕交事實作為響應，英法當局亦有較强硬的表示…在停略者進一步威脅之下，和平民主各國進一步團結抵抗的條件自然更加完備，張伯倫口中的召開世界和平會議，是不是就以這些條件為基礎的呢？假使是的，而且參加這僩會議的國家能够認定，（一）蘇聯為世界和平的柱石及（二）實行集體安全制度為世界和平的保陣，則召開會議及會議前途未嘗沒有期望。至於我們中國，雖然希望這個世界和平會議能够在最短期內召集並且完成其任務，俱是我們認定這種成就不能出於幻想，而要用堅持全國團結抗戰來促其實現。</p>
<h3>人道的威脅</h3>
<p>法西斯不僅就是戰爭，而且就是人道的威脅，我們在阿比西尼亞在西班牙尤其是在中國各地，都可以找到德意日本三個法西斯侵略者瘋狂轟炸屠殺破壞文化絕對人道的鐵証。</p>
<p>而且，法西斯對這種破壞文化經滅人道的×行，偏偏企圖多方掩飾，於是凡是就人道正義立場而揭發法西斯這種醜惡的×行的人，便有遭受非常迫害的危險。路透社八日上海電所稱日本嗾使所謂『公道會』向美國新聞記者阿各說等投寄恐嚇信，居然狂妄宣佈英記者田伯烈，美記者史諾及史沬特萊女士等正義人士的『死刑』，其××恫嚇，固不值一笑，而對于人道的威脅，可謂×相畢露了：</p>
<p>人道的衛士，正義的戰友，絕不會在這種××的恫嚇之前表示驚異，不，他們會更英勇更堅强地執行其神聖的任務，他們雖然會遭到無恥的偷襲，然而他們獲得四萬五千萬中華兒女和全世界勤勞大衆正義人士的擁護。</p>

<h3>粵語話劇集團　時代劇團七次公演　今天起一連四日在普戲院</h3>
<p>本報特訊「時代劇團」在愛好戲劇與關心文化工作者的印象中，該不是陌生的吧。它是七七抗戰序幕展開後在香港怒放的一戲劇花朶一。裏面的祖成員，都是一般比較有警覺性的靑年與劇界中堅的份子。過去一年來的成績，在香港戲劇領域已經留下了不可磨滅的功績。</p>
<p>他們在不斷的求進中，又得到外來職業劇團———如中旅，中藝——的影響與鼓勵，因此，更呈現着活潑，挺進的姿態了。</p>
<p>他們第一裝工作——定期性公演—直至第五次結束的當兒，恰巧名戲劇家歐陽予倩先生南來，允為該團導演，經過這個劃時期之後，推進香港話劇運動就益形積極了。</p>
<p>自去年十二月起，他們就在歐陽先生指導之下，忙於排戲。第六次的公演是在澳門，現在，又决定自今天起，一連四天在九龍普慶戲院上演，作為第二期第七次大公演。</p>
<p>演出的劇目是全國第一流劇作家曹禺先生的著名三部曲，和名劇作家陳白塵先生近作的國防諷刺喜劇「新官上任」。計今日是「原野」；第二天日幾是「原野一，夜戲是「日出」；第三天日夜是一新官上任」。第四晚是「雷雨」，這幾個劇本都是傑出的作品，配合他們練熟着的技巧，又有歐陽先生的領導，成功是可以預期的。</p>
<p>「國語劇不容易深入香港的一般觀眾」；假如說這是「中旅」和「中藝」美中不足的話，那麽，時代團就可能彌補這個缺陷了。</p>
<p>它——時代劇團——以廣州話演出，並不是消極的「討好」觀衆，而是以「適應」環境來做提高觀衆認識水準的過渡。該團同人以此自勉，我們亦以此寄予熱切的祈望，祝他們在文化荒島上完成這個艱上的任務。</p>
<h3>粵商港澳存鹽稅捐　奉令撥充救濟難民　每担繳稅國幣六角　總計可得十五萬元</h3>
<p>（專訊）廣州失守以後港澳兩地難民日衆、　我國僑港民間團體均奪起救濟、而我國當局對於此項救濟工作、尤不遗除力、聞粵省旅港澳鹽商最近曾接粵省鹽務局駐港辦事處何世禮科長通告、凡廣州淪陷後各鹽館所存港澳之鹽、均准於缴納每担國幣六角之鹽捐後、得運銷中山費安新會等三縣、所得捐稅、卽掃數撥充紅十字會救濟難民、聞各鹽商以為繳稅救濟難民、事屬義舉、均頗熱心、故接得通告後、巳紛紛照數繳納、查廣州失陷後、各鹽館所存港澳存鹽總數不下十二萬包、以每祖納稅國幣六角計算、全體鹽商繳納之數、當達十五萬元、紅十字會獲此大字的欵、又可活人無算、誠難民之一福音也云、</p>
<h3>我國棉花輸出　去年值國幣一萬萬元　日購入百份九十用製軍火　輸港者共值三十八萬餘元</h3>
<p>茲據海關報告、去年我國棉花輸出共一百三十五萬六千六百二十公祖、共值國幣一萬萬餘元、其中以輸往日本最多、佔全額百份之九十、計共九十六萬三千八百三十七公担、共值七千一百七萬九千七百二十三元、至翰本港者則為五千零九公担、共值三十八萬九千二百二十元、香我國棉花前因集中津滬出口、自該兩地淪陷後、日本卽向兩地大量採購運回、充作工業及軍火原料、以致去年全國棉花出口激增、奪佔出國土貨出口之第一位云、</p>
<h3>×在港搜購糧食　本港洋米繼續北運　旬日內洋米出口者萬餘包</h3>
<p>日前存港洋米、分批北運津魯各地者、數達五萬包有奇、據最近港中米業商人消息、自日前存米大宗北蒲之後、一般搜購者仍進行不輟、邇來安暹各地來貨頗多、本港米市、按勢當趨微跌、然因有人積極搜集之故、來米除供銷本港市場之外、其餘多轉輪出口、所運出目的地、雖未詳知、然以華南水陸交通、均遭封銷、唯一去路、則在華北華日各×人盤據品域、約計旬日之內、出口洋米數達萬包有奇、本港米市、因此種影響、市價未能下降云、</p>

<h3>殘「年」急景</h3>
<p>「年關」就是「難關」，窮人是頂怕逢着過年的，然而，你儘管怕。但是那無情的「難關」，　不會放過你。依然緊緊不捨地向你進迫着，因為那流般的光陰，巳一秒一秒的消逝過去，一轉眼，已經又是歲聿云暮的時候了！</p>
<p>巳經不算新的「新年」，快要來臨了，每年這時，人們都要着準備過「新年」而大忙特忙，富有的，固然為了縫新衣，買新鞋，購新帽，辦年貨，舉家大小，忙得不得開交，而一輩子的窮光蛋，却終日苦着眉頭，在打量怎樣一避債」或且『借債』的辦法，即凖備突破這比「美人關」還要難過的「錢關」？</p>
<p>農曆新年在香港，是相當的熱鬧的，香港政府也似乎因為順應居民的習慣，而把許多懸為禁例的事情，特別的予以通融辦理。如在這新年期內居民得自由燃放爆竹，（注意，燃爆竹時以不傷害行人，及害危及公衆治安為標準，否則仍要法律的制裁的），和撥出一指定地點，以低　的代價賃與年貨商人，以便自由擺賣年貨等，而政府的機關，却因為裏有華人服務的原故，而華人的習慣，在新年那天，都有團拜禮的舉行，所以也特別放假天，免得掃　們的興！</p>
<p>中環的蘇杭街，和灣仔海傍一帶，從勳街起至動寧道止之告羅士打道地段之內和對海，便是每年擺賣年貨的大好所在，照例每年從十二月廿一那天起，卽准許　擺，而政府方面，也提前招商架搭」擋一擋的攤位，以便小販們租賃應用、蘇杭街那邊，雖然沒有搭架，但是年貨的商人，却會利用沒人租賃的空舖，做他們的臨時商店；不過，今年的情形，却似乎有些不同了，因為今年的空舖不多，永遠的商店，却成了問題，何况是臨時的呢？有人租賃的，固然沒有可能，即使沒有人租賃的，却因為業主們乘機抬高租值，而成了問題。在這短促的營業時間當中，高　的租值，却非小本商人所能負担得來的，所以今年蘇杭街的年貨市塲，恐怕沒有往年那樣熱鬧了。但是，灣仔方面，情形就有點不同了，據一般年貨商人所表示的希望。今年的營業狀况，或者會比往年好，原因是香港多了數十萬「難民」，他們都是懷着鉅金，逃來香港避「難」的「高等難民」而他們一輩子對於吃，喝，玩的生活，都放得很使勁，小販們有了這一帮新增的主顧，那有不眉飛色舞而表示着大有希望呢，抓一把錢過「肥年」似乎沒有甚麽問題了吧，</p>
<p>年貨的銷場，已經較去年有希望了，但是關於花市的情形，却會使一般「護使者」起了憂慮。因為年花市上所售賣的鮮花，大半都是由國內各地運來的，而今年，却因為故國遍地烽煙，山東的牡丹，嶺南的梅花，和其他各地的名產如吊鐘，水仙等等應時花卉，都巳遍遭了×人的無情炮火的熏染，而損失便它那嬌艷的花顏了？同時更因為故國內地的交通，亦遭受着×人的極端的騷擾而阻塞着，所以一般花販商人，恐怕老血本遭受損失，多不敢如往年販運那般起勁了，所以年花的種類，當然會比往年大大的減少，那是無可疑問的。雖然他們大胆運來，也不愁會沒有銷路，然而血本有關，恐怕他們沒有這樣勇氣而巳。照這樣說來，今年的花卉市塲，那就難免有「花事闌珊」之感了！</p>

<p>交通旅行</p>
<h3>回憶中的南京</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>第一次踏進石頭城裏、是在民國十六年的夏天、我未到南京前、人家就吿訴我說、南京城的大、大的可怕、周圍數十里、直徑十餘里、坐起人力車來、起碼要二三個鐘頭、後來身歷其境、果然是名不虛傳、城分內外兩城、外城周圍共一百八十里、劇門十八、基地早廢、僅存其名、內城周圍約九十餘里、當年共有十二城門、東有豐潤、太平、朝陽三門、南有洪武、通濟、緊寶三門、西有水西、漢西二門、北有神策、儀回、金川、和通行江甯火車新闢的金金川門、</p>
<p>走出下關車站、乘馬車入那座破舊不堪的雉堞和黑洞洞的鳳門、馬蹄得褂、車輪軋軋、行在峙嶇高下不平的碎石子路上、我們已經淮了城內、但還像在郊外馳驅一樣、從鼓樓到鷄鳴寺的一帶、道路稍形平坦、兩旁都是田野、引目遠眺、時見負耕村農、携簞少婦、與垂髫牧豎、出入阡陌間、想不到在這座負有「脂粉南都」「王氣金陵」的　中、還可以看見這樣一副的農家樂圖</p>
<p>枝樓是城中唯一嶺峨的建築、樓旁空堆教畝、堆砌假山、遍種花木、平鋪草磚、綠茵如氈、別有佳趣、樓的西北、有亭一座、可供遊人休息、樓基是一座高裏、高數丈、下有三個穹門、中門最大、左右略小、臺上有暢觀閣、共兩后、登閣遠眺、江山如肅、可令人開襟、樂而忘蹌、</p>
<p>從鼓樓迤南轉灣至成寶街、沿途房屋、鱗次櫛比、時有精緻小洋房三四、朱瓦粉牆、屋頂上挿有靑天白日滿地紅旂幟、隨風招展於綠蔭間、相映成趣、在美麗的景色中、表現出莊嚴的氣象、那就是國民政府的外交部、</p>
<p>國民革命軍總司令部、設在舊督署街西花園內、園中樹木成蔭、有碧水一頃、環以瓦磚欄干、水面浮萍、密若綠茵、中有石舫、題有『不擊舟』三字、舫身比北京頤和園中的石舫略小、建築規模、也較隘狹、但比南翔古猗園中的似乎好得多、池旁尙有樓閣、有亭榭、淸竹一叢、亂石數疊、蟬聲鳥語、花香風暖、眞是一個洞天福地、</p>
<p>西花國在昔本爲軍閥私人的享樂場所、那時已改爲總司令部的辦公處、去池前行數百武、蜿蜓穿過了幾折廊廡、有一座朱牆高廳、那就是中央軍事政治委員會、昔日爲蘇省軍閥藏嬌的金屋、屋前有廣場、綿綿芳草、靑翠濃蔭、猶殘留有脂粉香氣、屋後別有院庭、中有磚砌小徑、兩旁植矮冬靑數百株、酈躅其閒、映衣成綠、徑盡可見高廳一座、前有墀階、這是國民革命軍日報的編輯部、</p>
<p>南京唯一納凉遊息的去處、是秀山公園、在通濟門內復成橋的東南、園地面積佔四十餘畝、在公園的左邊、可以望見復成橋邊拂垂秦淮河面的楊柳、右邊可以遙望紫金山上片片的雲影、園中原建有英威閣、閣中供前蘇督李純這像、閣的南面、有英威上將紀念碑、秀山將軍銅像、園的東南有秀山遺筆亭、歷史博物館、通俗圖書館等、在民國十六年、我初次遊覽秀山公園時、正有人提出改園剷像、沒收逆產、剷除圍中一切汚點的建議、秀山銅像外面用稻草裏着、巳看不出他的廬山眞面、不久、秀山公園果然改名爲血花公園、最後又改爲第一公園了、</p>
<p>公園中最使人流連的地方、是「逍遙遊」、那是全園的集中點、遊人大都散佈在附近閒坐品茗、這兒有濃密的綠蔭、溫草的軟地、有安適的籐椅、和白衣的侍者、涼爽的晚風、夾着荷花池裏蓮花的芳香、陣陣吹來、更能使人的心地感到迷醉一般的陶適、</p>
<p>南京有不少的名勝古蹟、使人徘徊遊覽、不忍遽去、尤其是那座莊　撲素的孝陵、面對着深隧的墓道、便令人油然而起崇敬的心情、此外、尙有高曠的鷄嗚寺、幽雅的玄武湖、隨靜的淸凉出、危峻的燕子磯等等、這一座獅岡嘛月的石頭城裏、過去是擁有「天府之雄」的偉名、但已遭受過多次的兵褒浩劫、在滄海桑田的泥土裏、還賸留有古代歷史建築的陳迹殘痕、</p>
<p>我雖不是一個有歷史癖的考古家、但是在新都建設後的十年中、面對着那新興的南京、我不自禁地要行起我囘憶中許多不可磨滅的印象之後、每一次到南京、每一次看到新的建染、一年多過一年地佈滿在這古代六朝的勝地、心中愈加深印了往年初遊時歷歷如繪的舊景、</p>
<p>自從蘆溝橘的無情砲火震驚了全國人民的迷夢後、上海南京、又柏繼淪陷、在國民政府尙未遷都之前、我在槍林彈雨中會冒險前往幣京一行、在大小路巷、發見了土袋與地下室、各院部的建築物、路上的交通、是都靈上了灰黑的土色、整個的城、像是給煙煤薰黑了的一般、在公園中陳列着許多在南京拾穫的日本飛機的殘骸、各公共樂場所、都已關門歇業、秦淮河和玄武湖、也都受了炸彈的陽予、變成了一片荒涼的死水潭了、我很後悔、在那一次倥　的旅行中、沒有到中山門外去憑吊一下紫『金』山上的兩位民挨英雄的『陵』墓、朱太祖和孫總理的英魂仍在、到如今他們倆還是在冥冥中凝視着這一座洪武的故都、和中華民國的首都的吧、</p>
<h3>閩北游程（二）</h3>
<p>— 王啓熙記</p>
<p>六曲——天游巖，桃源洞，金雞洞。</p>
<p>七曲——成雲峯，齊雲峯。</p>
<p>八曲——金石峯，靈峯，三層峯，鼓子巖。</p>
<p>九曲——翠雲峯，上昇峯，釣魚峯，釣魚台，小九曲。</p>
<p>是日吾人先至一曲，過止止庵，至武夷宮，是為全山道院最大者，中多碑記。此處現建陣亡將士公墓。再上至玉女峯，亭立溪心，時小雨濛濛，溪聲淸響，水流灣轉，不知幾曲。因沿溪而上，忘路之遠近，乃渡筏至隔岸行，順流而下，至公館已下午一時矣，知赴建陽之公共汽車，在赤石附近拗錨，已電修理廠派車來修。</p>
<p>公館地僻，並無食店。乃由汽車站長作飯招待，盛意可感。下午五時到達建陽，武夷之遊，尙稱滿意。</p>
<p>第八日　建陽至南平</p>
<p>早上收拾行裝，凖備南歸。李君等堅請冉遊數日，趙君因假期己滿，乃决于今日行，吾人乘公共汽車下，此去離南平凡一百十八公里，中經建甌歸吾人已至之地，而甌平之六十八里乃吾人此次之新旅程，沿途風景甚佳，將至南平，公路依山而築，下望長溪如帶，溪旁堆積木排甚多。</p>
<p>下午四時許至南平，住福建旅運社之南平招待所，是爲福建建設廳所附設，設備甚佳，堪稱模範旅館，休息後即至城內遊覽。</p>
<p>南平溪流稱爲劍津，此閒有劍津中學，余戲謂趙君曰，此校必俱牛津劍嬌兩大學之風，因相與一笑。考南平在晉時　延平縣，昔張華令雷煥至豐城掘獄屋，入地九文得石，石中有雙創，曰「龍泉」，曰「太阿」，以一與華，一自留佩，後華誅失劍所在。煥卒，子持劍行經延平津，劍忽躍投入水中，但見兩龍各數丈，此劍津所由名也。　（未完）</p>

<p>【乾成通凡】「桃花源外泛輕舟、賸水殘山汗漫遊、夾岸峯嵐秦洞窰、滿江風月楚天秋、響零故國身千里、潦倒新亭酒一甌、醉後不嫌狂似昔、高吟幾度看吳鈎、」此記者挑源秋夜泛舟作也、記者自客歲離徐、飄零蓬西、旣感國破家亡、且受某方通緝、田廬已鵲巢鳩佔、骨肉則散處天涯、落泊風塵、慨然投筆、爰　　鞭所及、擻　湘西鴻爪、　亦關心西南者之所樂覩歟、</p>
<p>湘西交通　山水險阻</p>
<p>湘西羣山綿　、崗　起伏、沅水迢、迂流其間、湘西交通、恃此一線、近年所闢之湘西公路、亦沿沅水作平行線、中間距離、最遠者不及百里、且多劈山爲道、盤旋迂曲、車行　　、是以物產轉輸、仍惟沅水舟楫是賴、記者此次長征、即以常德爲起粘、沿沅水而上、凡四十日而達濾　、計過大灘五、小灘上幹、而紀程則尙不足五百　里、可　極　通之難、由　溪而上、水道則沿沅水入貴、公路則在三角坪分支、湘西公路由此沿沅水經辰谿、芷江、晁　、以達黔者之鎭遠、川湘公路由此沿　溪經　城永綏以達川省之秀山、蓋湘西公路西南行、而川湘公路則西北行、此湘西交通之大略也、</p>
<p>昔日桃源　今賦同仇</p>
<p>當由常德起碇時、已屆晚秋、江平水穩、大小帆船、航行利便、惟汽輪則只能駛行至桃源以下、卽須擱淺、緣沅水只常德桃源一段、四時可涌汽輪、桃源以上、春夏兩季、航行無阻、秋冬則水淺灘出、帆船亦非加牽（絲旁以下仝）不能通過、而當夏季水發之際、則只有汽輪行駛、帆船又吿絕跡矣、夏水以　曆五月爲最甚、土人覘水之　、視本歲之有無春雪、春雪　日而水發、設本歲無春雪、則終歲水穩、識者推厥原因、謂春雪易融、斷難久積、七游崇山峻嶺、雪解水流、羣川競匯、爲勢甚猛、須百日而癢、歷試不爽、至冬雪則無此測驗、記者舟過桃源時、適值警報、雖一度舍舟登陸、巡視縣城、而成肆大多閉戶、街道窄狹、惟尙整潔、我某部駐此、設防甚周、社敎團亦正在調整民間工作、據施敎隊別君云、桃源雖古稱幽僻、但以接近常德、交通便利、逈非上游各地可比、民氣　爲發皇、縣城在沅水北岸、湘西公路則沿南岸西行、而向來稱道之秦人古洞、亦在南　羣　中、距城可三十華里、借乎舟行甚遠、未能一往遊也、為古稱避世之地、而今則敵愾同仇、亦　足令人色喜、秦不足避矣、</p>
<p>沅江多濰　兩岸削壁</p>
<p>舟過桃源、漸次入灘、沅水上游、以沅陵至桃源、三百華里之間、最爲多灘之段、大灘均在沅陵境內、沿江上溯、初爲甕子洞、次淸　灘、次　娘灘、次橫石灘、次九溪灘、五大灘中、淸浪最險、灘長五里、岸側有新息侯祠、一稱伏波宮、祀漢伏波將軍馬援像、杳火極盛、商船往　、於此下碇、必一禱祀、土人享祭尤虔、俗稱王爺廟、蓋沅水上游、爲古五溪蠻地、伏波平蠻、卽沿江上溯、清浪灘則其駐軍處也、灘多砥石、水為石束、道窄而流急、舟行經此、必臨時加增夫牽、背纜在岸、伏馳拖舟而行、水窄處僅容一舟、當記者到此時、由灘口下至於洞庭溪五里之間、帆檣如鑼、皆候序過灘者、獨我舟以輕小便利、從容獲過、未致躭延、聞有候半月之久、尙未起碇者、灘流之浚治、又烏可緩耶、下游甕子洞水道亦狹、準灘短尙易通過、上游羅娘、福石、九溪諸灘、水急而道寬、亦無停舟、惟各灘均兩岸削壁、水路窄峻、甕子洞之岸道尤陡、擊石繫鐵練以供攀援、淸康熙時辰州知府興修舊有三百餘丈、近亦殘缺不完、夫背纜登岸、握練以防傾側、蛇行制匐而　、土人以此爲業、一牽之加、獲値三數角、持舵者倍之、不灘舊例一牽付米一碗、橫石灘水道寬闊、須放水牽、牽夫背纜涉水以行、深及股際、冬季嚴寒、亦常如此、眞習焉安之者、</p>
<p>沅陵一帶　人煙稠密</p>
<p>沅陵爲淸辰州府治、城在北岸、倚山建築、形勢雄峻、今湘省府遷此、南岸爲汽車站、人烟密集、湘西第一重鎭也、社會文化、極臻發達、舊有沅濤、辰鐘兩報、近又新增中報、及由長沙移來之國民日報、銷數均廣、湘西消息、胥以此爲樞紐、據社敎團蔡君云、當地民智大開、施敎極爲順利、民族思想甚豐、歷次捐慕、均能踴躍輸將、以紓國難、過此而上、至濾溪境、卽有苗民雜處、習性强悍、號稱難治、顧富於傳統思想、湘行著主任陳渠珍氏、極爲苗民所信仰、現陳改設湘西綏署於乾城治苗尤爲便利、往昔國人所視爲神秘之區對於此澈底開發、至水道則過沅陵而上又趨平　、舟行　日抵滬、滬溪為沅水支流、縣治殷實、上游來舟、胥於此寄定、記者以任務關係、由此改乘汽車以赴乾城、凡三小時而達、車行均在山坡、下臨溪水、蓋即川湘公路也、較之三角坪以七之湘西公路、猶屬平坦、水道則只能划行小船、川湘交通、惟此公路是轉</p>
<p>湘西苗民　生活情狀</p>
<p>乾城爲遜淸乾州治、四面環山、築石爲城、褊小而堅固、公路在城東十五里、而以支這通縣城、四鄉苗民麕集雜處、十里左右、全係熟苗、三十里外、卽見生苗、熟苗服裝、男女皆以靑布纏頭、赤足草履、男子衣着、尙與漢人無別、女子則仍淸季服式、尤喜佩銀飾、項國練鎖、垂滿胸前、入市買費、亦能漢語、生苗則聚處山中、殊鮮入市、生熟苗皆喜民鴨血、肆中列碗盛血、苗飲輒就而暢飲、男女均健步、登山如飛、通行川省銅元、近經綏署佈吿、一律行使法幣、地方各界、完全擁護法幣政策、信用昭著、近且通行於苗民、苗民抗戰情緒亦極高、陳氏一令之力也、中小敎師服務團在乾社社敎工作、頗獲成効、今歲元且、張治中氏巡視湘西、在乾備受各界之歡迎、晚間地方民衆、復舉行火炬遊行、充分表現民埃精神之　潮、此眞堪吿慰國人者也、此後深、入苗疆、更有　昔、當續誌以告閱者、</p>

<h3>消滅我蠶絲業之陰謀</h3>
<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>因爲這樣一來、兇惡的日人正會利用估價的方法來把你的蠶室蠶具桑園等等、作爲固定資本、由他們來接辦、如此不更中了它們的毒計、故爲今之計、處在戰區裏種蠶種製造塲、正唯有積極的採取遷往游擊隊勢力區域與後方的兩條路綫、前者是把可以移動的東西儘量地儘速地向游擊隊控制勢力的區域中搬運、以備在游擊隊區域進行裝種事業的張本、同時將無法搬運的東西如蠶室附近屬室等等、加以全部或局部的摧燬、以斷絕日本人覬覦之心、我們曉得、日人在戰區中除掉勉强維持幾條交通線、以及較大的城市以外、其他廣漠的鄉村、俱在中國游擊隊控制勢力之下、所以種場只要能捨得眼前的點設備、搬到游擊隊區域中去經營是毫無問題的、而且對於幾個深得農民信仰的種塲蠶種、如滸墅關大有種塲的虎牌蠶種、滸關種場的壽星牌蠶種、壬戍館的三角牌蠶　、他錫三五館的三葫蘆牌羅種、等等、仍能在戰區的農民羣中維持着固有的地位、不致消滅、則將來驅走日人之後、就是拓展的絕好根基也、　（未完）</p>

<h3>星洲中華足球隊　先到菲而後來港　出征人馬勻稱三月十三日首程</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】星洲方面的華人足球界、近年來相當進步、在該處最得一般球迷擁戴之中華足球隊、本季橫掃一切、榮獲聯賽　標、</p>
<p>該隊仍不以獲得冠軍而自滿、爲使隊員球藝增準起見、乃决定於不久的將來、前赴菲律濱比賽、並順這來港、各情已紀前報、</p>
<p>月前該隊副隊長許厚坤、曾爲出征之事、來港與南華會接洽、該隊初擬的出征計劃、欲先來港、而後移師赴菲、但菲方對此殊不贊同、蓋誠恐該隊先到港比賽、倘若球員或有損傷、便合影響到菲時的叫座力、</p>
<p>該隊爲尊重主方之意、决先征兆、三月底方可來港、在港比賽兩塲、南華巳將此事呈報於總會而得其批准、並將麗華杯决賽提前三月廿六日舉行、　出四月一日二日等日期、爲該隊分與南華及港聯隊比賽之用、</p>
<p>記者昨接到該隊許副隊長來函、略謂該隊此次出征人馬、頗爲勻稱、但可惜前南華健將今回星復充左翼而常有超卓演出之鄭李良、因商務覊身、未克隨隊出征、然替補厥職之顔基祥、亦是個上好左翼、並打算　請吉隆坡守門健將黃錦柏及前鋒能員關順德、隨同出發、俾更增戰鬥力量、現該隊全體隊員、已進行請假、當可全數出征、至出發日期、已定三月十三日乘意郵維多利亞號雕星赴菲、於三月廿六日由菲來港云、錄其全隊隊員如下、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>埠際隊小試其技　與港聯戰成和局</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天下午五時、港埠際代表隊與港聯隊作練習賽於海軍球塲、埠際隊原班人馬上陣、港聯則有九龍會之烏烈之、廖亞臣、佐芝及聖約瑟之比路度缺席、陣線略有變動、</p>
<p>烏烈之、廖亞臣、佐芝三人所以倦勤、並非因事不暇、實乃不欲勞動、而凖備於明天出與南華南一决雌雄、以爭持別銀牌準决賽權、</p>
<p>門票一律二角、的是價　、因而看客殊擠擁、總有五千人以上、</p>
<p>因屬練習性質、埠祭隊各員的演出、不甚賣力、這乃意料中事、蓋他們爲應付未來之大戰、當然不願在此練習賽中、作過劇之競爭、或使身體所有損傷、致　大事</p>
<p>依我看來、埠際隊在昨戰中、有許多瑕疵、須加以注意和改善、</p>
<p>（一）前衛綫三人、果不出記者所　、都好盤球出擊、所以港聯前綫能够找到可勝的機會、全局比埠際隊爲多、那就因頃除隊三前衛好出擊、而常致後防空虛、港聯前綫乃得乘隙突襲、此種出擊法、將來應付菲隊、似不是善策、因爲菲隊各員俱够氣力、又復矯捷、突襲是他們所搜長、竊以爲、港隊三前衛對此出擊戰略、應有以改善、</p>
<p>（二）前線五人、聯　未得一致、李惠堂原是一個最善中路突擊之人、世大吿山奴與他似未能合作、傳球於左翼、多於傳中、因此、能充分輔助李惠堂的、祇一個馮景祥、而阜拉對於景祥、又未得聯絡一致、傳中術亦復欠準、侯澄滔方面、活動力已够、惟經切之、尙未合度、此點在澄滔順注意</p>
<p>（三）內衛方面、李天生可無間言、惟施漢所站位置、常未能作榮照之掩護、故互相關顧的合作功夫、尙欠諒解、</p>
<p>竊以爲、港隊各代表、應自即起、每晨舉行一次練習、設法改進全隊的攻守合作、將來應儲大戰、才易收效、</p>
<p>聯方面、以侯榕生、鄧廣森、及麥亞利士打演出爲最佳、陳德輝亦是可人兒、苟港聯原陣上塲、埠際隊必受威脅、上半場兩隊零比零、打成和局、下半時、開賽後七分鐘、惠堂遠射中楣、彈下地上、澄滔衝前一頂、首開紀錄、有頃、德輝得德祺之輸送、在門前打入一只、成一比一、直至完　、比數依然、兩隊名單如下、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……夢裏情人</p>
<p>The　Shopworn　Angel</p>
<p>片中描寫兩個受着不同命運所掃弄的靑年男女、一個是眞擎誠懇的農家子弟、將給無情的戰爭遺送到前綫去、另一個是靈魂上滿受創傷、命途多舛的掘金女伶、他們都在可怕的現實中、尋求「夢」的滿足、而夢一般的「愛」給他們不少的鼓動和安慰的、</p>
<p>瑪格烈莎　文、在本片中飾演一個飽經世故的掘金女伶、她犧牲了另一有錢男子對她所献的殷勤、而在特別的情境之下、接受另一個己經應徵入伍、眞摯誠懇的靑年男子的愛、雖則她充份明白、過慣了奢應淫逸生活的自已、和這質樸靑年的愛、是絕對難成事實的、但却爲了玉成那靑年的美夢、而在他將臨出發之前一刻、和他結婚、</p>
<p>本片對於美國參加歐戰時動員的情形、和充滿着緊張戰爭氣氛的社會動態、有極活潑迫眞的描寫、瑪格烈莎麗文在「戰後三友』一片中優異的演出、留給我們一個難以磨滅的印　、在本片中也因性格的適合、而有令人極滿意的演作、傑姆史蒂華在片中的演技、也像他在「七重天」中同樣的優秀動人、餘如華爾特皮金也能稱聽、</p>
<p>皇后平安　同映……春心綺念</p>
<p>Youth　Takes　A　Fling</p>
<p>片中描寫一個慶情女店員、追求她所夢想的人、而不幸那男子却有些獃　、除了醉心航海事業之外、沒一件事物値得他的注意、女人當然也不能例外、就是多情嬌麗如那女店員、對地所献的慇勤、也絲毫得不到他的歡　、末了還决然的想遠避她的糾纏、但暈浪的痛苦、打破了他航海的迷夢、也醫好了地無情的毛病、</p>
<p>本片雖則確可能的以各種場面、如時裝表演、公共游泳塲等鏡頭、來充實內容、但尙未能完全掩飾本片內容空虛的缺點、演員方面、安持麗然絲尙有旎旎動人的演作、至於飾那醉心航海的靑年的佐麥克和、雖則地對性於格的表現、太爲跨張一點、但他却是片中自始至終趣味的中心人物、</p>
<p>東方……錦心繞口</p>
<p>You're　A　Sweetheart</p>
<p>新環球公司出品、擁有兩位歌唱明星、喬治茂翻和愛　絲費、幾位滑稽明星、老滑頭却爾斯惠寗格和傻頭傻腦的安台第凡、笑料充足、歌曲也很動聽、</p>
<p>大華……三姊妹</p>
<p>Sally　Irene　and　Mary</p>
<p>愛麗絲費、瓊黛維斯、理喬麗蕙佛、在這裏是親熱得如姊妹三個似的女友、因爲世界不景氣、她們充過修指甲女郎、做過舞場中賣香烟的女侍、因此認識了歌唱明星湯美—湯尼馬丁—而且莎遠—愛爾絲賣—一見他之後、就和他暗中相愛着、其後幾經周折、她們得到了一支破舊不堪的遊艇、爲了要把它裝修成一個水上夜總會、需用一筆大款項、莎麗和湯尼那决心　性一己的串羅、願意和另外的愛着他們的兩位富人給婚、祇要他們能拿出錢來、水上夜總會開幕、天假之便、兩位一男一女的出錢主顧、竟自互相愛慕上了、於是皆大歡喜、莎麗湯尼立卽結婚、連做淸道夫的傑美杜侖也和愛琳—瓊黛維絲—儷影雙雙、樂不可支、</p>

<p>爲了迎合低級觀　、劇情牽强不堪、演技亦不作、陣舊的作法使觀衆們討厭、</p>
<p>中央……胡惠乾打機房</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>爲了「方世玉打擂台」片活的賣座成績特佳、聰明的製片商看准了生意眼、本片就是動機中產生的、</p>
<p>胡惜乾軟弱不堪、被機房中人欺凌、父旣被害、尙欲佔其妻妹、胡惠乾爲環境所迫、决定順開機房、赴少林寺學藝、以便將來報仇、經過了不少的困苦和危險、在某一天他樂然回來、卒報父仇、本片劇情就是這樣簡單、導演無手法可言、酈山笑改變作風飾胡惠乾、演來尙可、徐人心已久別銀壇、本片中馮婦再作、演出尚佳、全片佈景太簡單、幾塲打武亦不見聚張、</p>
<p>利舞臺高陞　同映……花木蘭</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>劇情描寫一個現代的女子、因爲曾經演出過舞台上的「花木蘭」、因此她時時想做一做現代的「花木蘭」、果然在國難嚴車的時候、她實現了她的志願、原因是她發現了一個組織很有規律的漢奸機關、於是就和她的情人屆山笑、共同設法破比秘密機關、盜取文件、不知道經了多少的困難、他們總於達到了目的、連伶俐志昏的漢奸們、布被他們偉大的精神所感化了、共同出發到前線去、</p>
<p>我們不否認這劇情在華南是較好的一部、但是還相當牽强、導演不能利用電影的技巧、鄭山笑陳雲裳之演技甚、</p>
<p>太平……兒女英雄傳</p>
<p>國片</p>
<p>因爲沒有神怪片那樣不合情理的電方、新華公司這張片子還算不怎麽壞、雖然出說不上是有怎樣好的成績、全劇中許多應當緊張些的地方、却平淡的放過去了、顧蘭君——這位戰後紅得發紫的女星——表演還不錯、</p>

<h3>抗戰文藝與集體創作</h3>
<p>— 雲潔</p>
<p>在抗戰文藝的創作實踐活動中，我們需要特別强調集體創作這一新型的進步的方法，因爲它是人類藝術地認識世界和表現世界的最新颕而且最高級的工具，最有力的一種方式，只有應用這種新型的有力的方式，透過集體的認識過程和表現過程，才能最精密的，正確而生動的反映出目前橫在中國面前的緊急動亂的抗戰現實表現出中國抗戰現實底細　曲折的各種變化發展，以及這些變化發展的本質和前途，抗戰文藝底最基本的任務乃是在於忠實正確反映抗戰現齊，因此作爲最善於認識和表現客觀眞理，最能够發掘和反映現實的眞實底集體創作方法，就成爲抗戰文藝的創作，實踐活動所應該特別强調，特別着重的一個創作方式。而且，因爲抗戰文藝是有政治的組織性的，它要組織一切文藝工作者到抗日民挨革命的統一陣綫中去，所以更加需要特別强調和着重那富於技術的組織性，能够組織廣大的作家或文藝靑年集體創作，作它底基本的創作方法，透過它底技術的組織性，從而建成抗戰文藝之政治的組織性。</p>
<p>集體創作是人類幾千年來藝術實踐的發展底一條新路，是人類文藝創作的一種新技術，這新技術，巳經由國際上各種各樣的作家們在實際應用着，而且已經得到了良好的效果，好像蘇聯偉大的作家高爾基所主持的「世界的一日」，「內戰史」，「工廠史」，國際作家保衛文化協會主編的「百科全書」等，都是國際作家們集體創作底優良的成果：至於我們中國，也可以看到中國文學社主編的「中國的一日」，丁玲主編的「二萬五千里」，以及其他許多優秀的創作劇本和小說，所有這藝衛的成果，都足以証明集體創作是一個健全的精密的創作方法，証明了這一方法對於反映現實的優秀性。</p>
<p>所謂集體創作，乃是在一個土要的特定確目網領之下，或者在一種特定的主題和題材之下，組織起一部份的作家來共同從事創作，集體地處理主題的表現，集體地從事素材的搜集，以至於藝術的槪括，結構，佈局，題才的發展，人物的性格，姿態，言動和描寫手法，用語修辭等，都由集體來討論與决定，然後通過集體的表現和修改的過程而完成底創作的活動。這種創作方法，能够把各式各樣的作家底文藝的手法與風格，個性與認識溶合於新的藝術結晶中，從而做成比較個別作創作的更豐富更優秀的集體的文藝作品。至於作家在參加了集體創作之後，是否會限制了他個人的特殊的才能和他的天才之發展呢？我們對于這一問題的答案是否定的，我們知道集體主義和個性（個人）並不是對立的，集體主義只不過是把各個個性統一在一個正確的認識範　之內，對個性加以誘導和影響，使之在實踐底過程中改造自己而已，所以一個抗戰文藝作家參加了集體的創作，不特不致妨礙他的個性及天才之發展，而且由於集體的督促，引導和影響，作家的主觀將更能日益和客觀的抗戰現實相隨發展，他的天才將因而愈加完備，他底個性和風格將更能獲得良好的發展，克服他本身的內在缺點，使他的天才，個性，風格與認識，都融和在集體的實踐中，創造出更高級，更優秀的集體的藝術結晶，這集體的藝術結晶，在藝術的價値上有看更高級的意義。</p>
<h3>「冊府元龜」</h3>
<p>— 天餘</p>
<p>這幾天偶然閱宇文　昭的大金國志看到大金國主的冊立張邦昌文一篇，冊立劉豫文一篇。我把這兩篇文章細讀之下，深深地佩服大金國主的聰明。他的親善的口吻，眞和今人逼肖，他的一想情願的計劃，也和今人相仿。這眞是當今的龜鑑，所以我借用「册府元　」四個字做標題，把它們節錄如下，以供衆賞：</p>
<p>（一）冊立張邦昌文</p>
<p>「……粵惟有宋，實乃通鄰，……天厭其德，民不聊生：而又姑務責人，罔知省己……以故徽師命將，伐罪弔民……今者國旣乏王，民宜混同，然念厥初，誠非貧土，遂命帥府，與衆推賢……」</p>
<p>（二）冊立劉豫文</p>
<p>『……無並爾疆，以示不貧之德；止遷其主，用彰伐罪之心……咨爾劉豫……居于亂邦，生不遇世。百里雖智，亦奚補於虞亡，三仁至高，或願從於周仕……付爾封彊，並從舊楚；更須安集，自適攸居。爾其上體天心，下從民欲，忠以藩王室，信以保邦圻……」</p>
<p>我們看！第一篇裏什麽「伐罪弔民」「誠非貪土」多麽冠冕堂皇。第二篇開首重申「誠非食土」：中間一段贊揚劉豫的話，盡量把漢奸的身份抬高，叫漢奸們怎不感激涕零；末段指示出漢奸的任務，在於建立新秩序，做大金國奴隷。這兩篇文章做得條理不紊，涵義深長。我覺得大金國主可以算是『以華制華』的發明者了！</p>
<h3>廢墟與砲煙</h3>
<p>— 尾崎士郎作　林煥平譯</p>
<p>夫婦一齊到戰場來，這當然是下了絕大的决心。在談天之間，這個攝影師的生活不知不覺　成我們的興味的中心了。細長的市街沿着湖岸連續着。兩旁的人家，聽壁屋頂，通通都崩塌着。看到無論那一個民衆的家財道具等物，都是雜亂地散在鄉裏，可知道住民都是單身逃走了似的，照井上大佐的說話，湖口的市街不是爲砲擊與爆炸所破壞。而是被砲彈的聲舉所震壞了。旣無風災，亦無水災，在千年二千年的長期間中，也沒有地震過，在頺勢裏保全着命脈的古舊建築，被人爲的砲彈的聲響所震壤，這恐怕也有可能性吧？這樣想起來，在古舊的歷史中鎭壓着悠閒的人情而存績到今日的湖口的市街，也只剩下一個殘骸而滅亡了。但是，住民無事地囘來，馬上恢復從前的生活，恐怕不行吧。橫橫地傾倒着的屋頂的瓦，一觸着手指，我的手尖立卽就押進瓦裏去了。這樣的敝壞屋宇。而能抵禦風雨到至今，想起來眞有點不可思議。在這樣古舊的城市裏，市民也在狂信的感情下一天一天地過活着似的。從被破壞了的民家的門口望進去，看到每家的深堂，都有熏黑的神壇。由政府煽動起來的抗日情緒，也不是由理論產生，而是在長月年不知不覺中間溶化在他們的信仰之中似的。大大的倉庫的墻壁和廟宇的石墻等，都像其他各地一樣，貼滿着激烈的宜傳文字。剛看到一怒吼吧，中國！」，「三民主義卽是救國主義！」的標語，却立刻又發見在街的中部，掛着「上海申報駐湖分館」的招牌的小洋樓的門前，貼着墨痕淋漓的大標語：「好男兒應把血洒在沙塲上」。在市外有門面壯嚴的家，門的兩旁掛着整然成列的招牌。一個一個讀去是：「湖口縣司法處」，「湖口縣政府經徵處」，「國民經濟建設運動委員會江西湖口縣支會」，「湖口縣警察隊」，一湖口縣抗戰宣傳部」，「江西省防空協會湖口縣支會」，「湖口縣社會軍事訓練總務部」，「江西省湖口縣在鄉軍人分會」，「湖口縣新生活運動促進會」——</p>
<p>屋頂上，像統一着一切機關似的，掛着一塊木匾額：「長期抗戰一，推動一切機能，培養抗日感情的國民政府的意圖，在這整然排列着的招牌之蔭下，深深地種着根。在園繞着三方的山之對面，當時還活躍危游擊隊。湖口還在×人（指我軍，上仿此——譯者）的包圍之中。兵力單薄的日本軍不絕地移動着軍隊，牽制×人。×人的大部隊都是神出鬼沒地出現，所以一刻也不能高枕而臥，井上大佐前天也爲着探測深水，乘着小汽船在江岸航行着——是黎明時份，霧靄漸漸地稀散，晴朗起來，從眼前的對岸，看到了搖着太陽旗的人。確定那是日本兵，把船駛到對岸去，抵岸一看，在濕着露水的草上，頹然地倒着五六個死了似的兵士。搖旗的，是伍長，倒着的，三各是他的部下，在街上一邊走着，井上大佐一邊用貫注的調子設着。是的，是的——是有趣的名字的男子呀。是叫做緋威伍長呀，早兩天被派去當探子，偵探有無×陣，不知在何時之間，走進了集結在山麓的大部隊的敵人之中了啊。向那方面走都全是敵人前後都不能動了，好容易走到這江岸來，是翌日的午後七時了。總之，是非常的苦勞吧。走到那個方向去，都不知道是不是安了，不吃不喝，在離揚子江岸五里的地方來未法去。終至身體不能再了動而倒下去。　（未完）</p>
<h3>囘聲</h3>
<p>— 譯篇堯</p>
<p>森密的叢林，透過一片冷月的幽光，地面上散亂着枝柯老態的濃影。更從樹幹與樹幹間的空隙，可遙聞一兩聲犬吠，看見遠方一兩處明滅的漁燈；在這裏，集合了百多個靑年，他們都是來自那遙遠的地方，毀了家，亡了鄉的流浪者。他們流浪了個多月，步行了二百多里，曾避過×人的炸彈的掃射，焚燒，終於到了這裏來。</p>
<p>他們有共個一心，一個不鬆懈，不怕死爲國的决心；准備明天出發，所以就趁這個月明的靜夜，在那廣關，稠密的業林，討論一切。</p>
<p>他們都是席地坐着，有些手裏拿着手冊，鉛筆，正在埋頭認眞地去寫，忽而一塊坍了半截土牆上面，站着一個穿着中山裝，漆黑肌商和風塵滿面，約奠近三十歲的漢子，手裏拿着幾本書（或者這就是公文），向着大衆講話。</p>
<p>大約這就是隊長了，他興奮而沉毅地喊着：『同志們！打這個時辰起，我們都是一家人了。我們這一羣中的每一個都是沒有家的了，我們的父母兄弟姊妹都給×人殘殺了，我們還有什顧慮呢？」</p>
<p>說到這裏，隊伍中有兩個十六七歲的女孩子傷感起來，用面巾抹着眼淚。可是，在這皎潔的月底下，立刻就給隊長發覺了。</p>
<p>「同志們！改變你們的態度罷！我們不應感傷，我們應該悲憤，我們不應流淚，我們應該了解，誰使我們這樣呢？這個問題祗有我們堅决的鬥爭，才是眞實的答覆……」</p>
<p>「……明天，我們就要回去繼續我們的工作了，在未出發以前，各小隊若有問題，不防在這時提出來。」</p>
<p>隊長說完了，大家沉點幾分鐘，突然有一個小隊長站起來發問：「總隊長；我們這一隊的同志，有一個共通的意見，就是要求上頭給我們的棉衣。同時希望我們能够武裝。」</p>
<p>隊長毫不思索，立刻就答覆了：一現在，因爲不能與上級通訊，所以棉衣問題暫行擱置，只要大家呈着一種勇敢的精神，寒冷就不大覺得了；至於子彈，我們要記得游擊術的大綱，等敵人到達一定距離，合我們射程的標準始始行放槍，切忌慌張亂放，耗費子彈，於必要時，可搶得×人的黃絨服裝來給我們禦寒，搶得×人的武器和糧食做我們的武器和糧食」每個人聽了這些話都興奮起來。最後隊長要求大家堅决的答覆就是：『我們這一隊是同生共死。同進同退，大家願意不願意？」</p>
<p>「願意！」如雷一樣地震×了沉寂的叢林，百多隻手都高擎起來了。大家幾乎興歷得要流淚，終于悲頃地沉着歸隊，肅穆地走出　林，高唱着：</p>
<p>『……我們要捍衛祖國，</p>
<p>我們齊赴沙塲……</p>
<p>……衛……衝破了一切惡勢力</p>
<p>貫—貫澈了總理的主張……」（出發之歌。）</p>
<p>晶瑩的月亮西沉了，天宇只熾閃着幾顆黯淡的辰星，雞已高高的叫，業林回復了原有的靜寂，祇聽見一片『出發』歌雄壯的囘聲。</p>
<h3>法西斯蒂拔萃</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>今日在法西斯蒂國家的文人，只有二條出路；一條就是屈伏於法西斯的權威下，上焉者爲法西斯主義製造些歪曲欺騙的「理論」，下焉者只好做做捧塲應聲的帮閒者，另一條出路就是轉入地下層。爲反法西斯作英勇的爭門。所以究極說來，眞正的出路原只有後者的一條，前者雖是暫時的出路，實際却是一條斷巷。</p>
<p>但正像耶蘇所說的：「天國的門是狹的，只有少數人能够進去。」法西斯國文人的眞正出路，也是極狹的，沒有對正義和眞理具有絕大的信心，沒有犧牲個人生命以上的精神，是難以踏進這條出路的。於是我們就看到了所謂「轉向」文人的大批出現。</p>
<p>在法西斯國的文人『轉向』，就是表示文人的沒落。這說明早先這輩人曾經對眞理發生醉心過，或甚至爲眞理鬥爭過。但因爲他們的信心薄弱，經不起暴力的威脅，結果只得「轉向」趨於絕路。不過像在另一篇文中說過的，無論在國際上，國內政治上，以及在個人的信念上，對法西斯主義的讓步，就等於爲自己掘墳墓。我們從下面所述的日本法西斯派正從文人對於『轉向』文人的『禮　』中，可以看出『轉向』文人的一失足成千古恨。</p>
<p>「…許多轉向者，像秋風落裴般從無產階級的運動中跌了出來。我對於他們不勝憤怒地加以痛　。這倒並非因他們離開了我的陣營。從立塲言，他們倒無甯更接近我了，然而我對於這種思想的無節據性，實在感到不快，轉向就轉向了，但等到運動已臨困難而再轉向，實在是卑汚極的</p>
<p>『日本的社會，能容許這許多變節的人物，眞是怪事。』（杉山平助者『中國，中國人及日本』，一四〇頁）</p>
<p>『迄最近爲止，一味在自由主義空氣中呼級的人們，忽然搖身一變而爲大陸進出的勇士，而且超乎常情的嘲弄鄰國人民，這種行爲的動機在那裏，姑且不問，但這輩人的知性究竟丟到那里去了呢。多年來的理論和節操，又流到那裏去了呢？</p>
<p>『對於馬克斯主義的轉向者，也可以同樣的說。迄最近爲止，馬克斯和恩格斯的喇叭卒認爲眞理只存在於這輩人的筆下，把一切事物都從這一觀點來測量對於其他一切，一槪輕視漠然，非難並攻擊，大有地上不久卽將化成馬克斯的王國：一味地宣傳這種福音，並以殉敎者自　。可是這一輩人，曾絲何時，忽然來說教東洋文化，日本文化，而以東亞協同體的新選手姿熊登塲了（室伏高信『知性之再建』一文。『日本評論』一月號）</p>
<p>翻了一看，也許要認這是日本自由主義者和馬克斯主義的戰土在責駡他們的叛徒，實際上却是法西斯蒂喉舌對『轉向』文人的奚落。雖然他們在後面板起了道義的面孔，帶拍帶為的『禮　』了一番，但在我們看來，拍是有作用的，嘲屬才表示他們的有『先見之明』，他們老早投着了主人，對於想分吃一杯獎的『轉向者』，露出了一副獰笑的面目。</p>
<p>信心微小的人們啊，你們垂涎的那根骨頭，早已在別人的嘴裏了！</p>
<p>但在我國，迷於托派和漢好思想的人們，若肯幡然覺悟，這意義和日本人民的『轉向』，是絕對不同的，因爲這里的一座分水嶺是正義。在這里沒有奚落，沒有諷嘲，而是對於迷途之羊的歡迎。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Plunder of the Entire Economic Landscape of Central China</h3>
<p>— Gu Xiaohui</p>
<p>The Japanese are now actively engaged in economic aggression in the occupied areas of Central China, organizing the so-called "Central China Development Corporation." Using the principle of "one industry, one company," they are establishing various subsidiaries to monopolize all industries in Central China, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and electricity. Their aim is to seize all economic power within the war zone in their dealings with China, exclude international interests in China from outside, and exploit the people's economy and promote it in China for their own benefit. In short, they plan to extract the economy of the occupied areas to compensate for Japan's financial shortcomings, to carry out their long-term war against China, and to completely derive the supplies for the Japanese army in China from the Chinese people themselves, as can be seen in Itagaki's recent response to the members of the Diet.</p>
<p>Based on my own investigation, and the records in Chinese, English, and Japanese newspapers, I will now describe the methods of the Japanese economic aggression in Central China, the organization of various aggressive institutions, and the state of the occupation of various industries in Central China. I will write this piece to let everyone see the whole story of the Japanese economic aggression in Central China, so that our people know that this so-called aggressive action of forcible occupation and bullying will not succeed if we do not agree to it, and that one day we will recover our old possessions.</p>
<p>1. The So-called "Central China Development Corporation" (?)</p>
<p>In the Northeast, we know that Japan had a so-called "South Manchuria Railway Company" (Mantetsu), which the Japanese themselves called the vanguard of the colonization of the Asian continent. After 1918, within a few years, all kinds of economic rights outside the customs were in its hands. After August 13th, Japan adopted this policy again and established two new companies on November 7th last year: one was the so-called "North China Development Company" for North China, and the other was the so-called "Central China Development Corporation" for Central China. Like Mantetsu, these two organizations are "national policy companies" recognized by the Japanese government. This article will only discuss the "Central China Development Corporation."</p>
<p>The "Central China Development Corporation" was established according to the resolution passed by the 73rd Japanese Diet on April 28th last year. After it was established in Tokyo on November 7th last year, the head office was said to be located in Shanghai (but it has not yet been realized). The company's capital is 100 million Japanese yen, contributed equally by the Japanese government and private sector. Its first paid-up capital was 31,382,344 yen, divided as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Government – 18,882,344 yen</p>
<p>In-kind contribution – 7,640,000 yen</p>
<p>Cash – 11,242,344 yen</p>
<p>Private Shares – 12,500,000 yen</p>
<p>But sadly, this private capital was raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, with as many as 9,770 shareholders participating. And the money raised was only over 1.2 million.</p>
<p>The company's organization, in addition to many subsidiaries, is divided into three sections and one office, as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Head Office</p>
<p>(Subsidiaries)</p>
<p>General Affairs Section</p>
<p>Commercial Affairs Section</p>
<p>Business Investigation Section</p>
<p>(Tokyo Branch)</p>
<p>The important person in charge, the president, is appointed by the Japanese government, Kodama Kenji. This old man was the Japanese president of the so-called Sino-Japanese Trade Association before the war. We all remember a few years ago when he came to Shanghai to celebrate with wine at the International Hotel, singing about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation! Now the fox's tail is revealed, and it turns out that so-called "cooperation" is like this. Anyone who is fascinated by the dream of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should also wake up. Now, let's list the important persons in charge of this company:</p>
<p>President: Kodama Kenji (Former General Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)</p>
<p>Vice President: Hirazawa Kaname (Former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications)</p>
<p>Director: Kanai Kiyoshi (Former Commissioner of South Manchuria Railway Company)</p>
<p>Sonoda Saburo (Former Foreign Affairs Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)</p>
<p>Yutani Kyoichi (Former Director of Sino-Japanese Industrial Association)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the establishment of this company is actually a general mechanism for exploiting Japanese private capital and representing the Japanese government's economic aggression against China. The aggression is implemented by its subsidiaries. The establishment of subsidiaries follows the principle of one company per industry, and all industries are controlled by the company in that industry. The goal is to control the entire industrial and commercial hub of Central China, exclude European and American interests in China, and make China its economic appendage, like an ancient serf, and prevent it from ever entering the modern industrial path.</p>
<p>The details of the company's control of various industries will be written later. Now, let's talk about the activities of Kodama Kenji, the mastermind of the company.</p>
<p>2. Kodama Kenji's Activities in China</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "Central China Development Corporation," Kodama Kenji made a statement to a Reuters reporter in Tokyo, wanting to induce the United Kingdom and the United States to invest in its controlled area, and therefore denied control and monopoly. First, Kodama said, "The company is not controlled by the army, and it is completely commercial in nature." This is a complete lie. It is clearly one of Japan's "national policy companies" against China. Kodama himself was appointed by the Japanese government. According to Tokyo itself, the Japanese government has the power to supervise the company, has the power to cancel the company's resolutions, has the power to appoint and remove the company's responsible persons, and can issue various necessary orders in national defense or other necessities. This shows that Kodama's words are all lies. In fact, this company is the representative of the Japanese government, and the responsible persons inside are the pawns of the warlords. Second, he said, "The company has no intention of monopolizing," which is completely fooling people. Looking at "Mantetsu" in the Northeast, it has completely excluded all international interests from "Manchuria" to this day. Close to North China, the control of cotton is nominally by the puppet organization, but isn't it actually this so-called "North China Development Company"? Again, in Shanghai and inland waterways, since the establishment of the Japanese "Inland River Shipping Company," it has been completely monopolized. The "Inland River Shipping Company" is a subsidiary of this company. Foreign shipping companies have indeed negotiated with the Japanese for passage permits, but they cannot obtain them to navigate the inland rivers. There are many other industries like this, isn't that enough to prove his control? At the same time, Japanese newspapers all admit that the policy of controlling Chinese industry and commerce will be the center of attention from now on. Third, Kodama said: "Shanghai is much more prosperous, and Japanese commerce has developed accordingly, and there is no reason why foreign commerce should not expand alone." This is their attempt to lure the United States to invest in Central China to complete its development conspiracy. However, all parties ignored Kodama's remarks, and he left Tokyo for Shanghai to work in this situation.</p>
<p>Kodama arrived in Shanghai on the Miyazaki Maru on November 26th last year. At the same time, the company's Vice President Hirazawa and directors also came. They held so-called "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation measures" with the puppet side in Hongkou, including:</p>
<p>(1) Expanding the strategy of the Development Corporation.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing the Japan-China Bank.</p>
<p>(3) Issuing counterfeit money.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting military currency.</p>
<p>(5) Other control matters.</p>
<p>On November 30th, he went to Nanjing from Shanghai to discuss cooperation methods with the highest Japanese military commander; and convened a meeting of the puppet governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in Nanjing to discuss their so-called "cooperation" methods. In fact, it was just asking a few puppets what they had that could be plundered. It is said that Kodama will live in Shanghai for a long time, but his plan to establish the Japan-China Bank and issue counterfeit money has failed due to the righteous refusal of Chinese and foreign banks. The promotion of military currency, after he arrived in Nanjing, has been agreed with the Japanese side and has been implemented since November 30th last year. That is, the issuance of new military currency in the occupied areas to replace bank notes, a plundering policy of buying goods with waste paper.</p>
<p>3. Establishment of Various Controlled Companies</p>
<p>Regarding the various subsidiaries established by the Japanese to control various industries, before the "Central China Development Corporation" was established, and before Kodama came to Shanghai, many companies had already been established under the "entrustment" of the Japanese army. Later, when the "Development Corporation" was established, each company became its subsidiary. After Kodama came to China, several new ones were established.</p>
<p>(1) Controlling inland river shipping, the "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" was established on July 28th last year, with a capital of 2 million Japanese yen. The Japanese "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 600,000 yen, and Nisshin Kisen Kaisha contributed 400,000 yen, totaling 1 million. The remaining 1 million was used to evaluate the plundered Chinese property as 1 million to serve as equity capital. The company uses the control of the inland river routes of Central China as its name, and currently has 75 steamships and 70 boats. All important routes in Central China are chartered by the company.</p>
<p>(2) On July 31st last year, the "Central China Electric Communication Co., Ltd." was established with a capital of 15 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 6 million, the International Electric Communication Corporation 2 million. Japan Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 1 million, Japanese Electric Company, Sumitomo Electric Wire Company, Furukawa Electric Industries, Fuji Electric Wire Company, Oki Electric Company, a total of 1 million, totaling 10 million, and the remaining 5 million, which was used to plunder the various original telecommunications equipment and industries of Central China, converted into the equivalent amount. The company operates Central China's telegraph, telephone, and external radio communication business in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, etc., all urban areas and all remaining wired, wireless, telegraph, telephone, and coordinated operations, and also plans to expand wireless radio and other businesses to Nanyang, Europe, and the United States, as well as submarine telegraphs in North China. Long-distance telephone between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, and wireless telephone between Shanghai and Tokyo, have been connected.</p>
<p>(3) "Central China Hydroelectric Co., Ltd." was established on June 30th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, President Aoki Tsumoru, with a capital of 25 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 7.5 million, and the "Central China Electric Power Company" contributed 2.5 million, totaling 10 million Japanese yen. The remaining 15 million was plundered from Chinese power equipment, which was converted into 9 million yuan, and equipment from other water utilities was converted into 6 million yuan, totaling 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Plundering the iron production of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the "Central China Iron Ore Co., Ltd." was established on April 8th last year with a capital of 20 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 4.5 million, the Japanese Railway Department 3 million, Japan Steel Pipe Tsurumi Iron Works, Kokura Steel, Nakayama Steel Manufacturing, Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, etc. contributed a total of 2.5 million yuan, and the remaining 10 million yuan was used to convert the mineral production of about 20 iron ore areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces into 10 million yuan, which was plundered to serve as half of the equity capital.</p>
<p>The plan is to first mine the Taochong iron ore area between Nanjing and Wuhu, and between Taiping and Tongling. The Taiping iron ore is the target for the first mining operation. The first annual plan is to mine 1 million tons of iron ore, which has been carried out in the Tu'ao Mountain and Nanshan areas. Now, an average of 500 tons of iron ore is mined every day. The first ship of 7,000 tons was shipped from Ma'anshan on October 26th last year, the second ship of 3,000 tons was shipped on the 31st, and the third ship was shipped to Japan on November 10th.</p>
<p>(5) Opening long-distance buses in the occupied area of Central China, the "Central China Urban Bus Co., Ltd." was established on November 5th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million Japanese yen. The Xingzhong Corporation, Dazhi Automobile Company, Jiangnan Industrial Company, etc. jointly contributed 2.5 million, paying half of it first. The remaining 500,000 was replenished with the plundered Chinese physical objects. The company's business scope includes the seven cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, specializing in urban public buses, as well as intercity long-distance buses and truck transportation. In the concession north of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai, it also occupied the exclusive rights granted by the Public Concession Authority to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, and opened public buses in the cross-border road construction area. Another company will be established separately to specialize in long-distance buses.</p>
<p>(6) Controlling the sericulture, silkworm, silk reeling mill agriculture and industry in Central China, the "Central China Sericulture Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai, established on August 10th last year with a capital of 8 million Japanese yen (some Japanese say it is 10 million Japanese yen, anyway, they are all bragging, no matter what). The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 6 million, paying half of it first, and using the industrial assets of silk reeling mills in Central China to make up for the estimated 2 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The company's intentions:</p>
<p>(1) To operate machine reeling silk business. (2) To operate the manufacture and distribution of silkworm eggs. (3) To operate silk hand-reeling industry. (4) To sell local silk. (5) To carry out the above related affairs.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wang Zihui, the "Chairman of the Executive Yuan of the Reformed Government," sold silk reeling mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Haining, Deqing, and other places to the Japanese when he went to Japan, and signed a satisfactory agreement with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry:</p>
<p>(A) The production of silkworm cocoons in Central China must be increased to the pre-war level, and the number of silk reeling machines should be limited to about 10,000. (B) The reeling and distribution of silk cocoons shall be managed by the "Central China Sericulture Company." (C) Japanese silk reeling mills should specialize in reeling higher-quality silk of 20 to 22 deniers and 13 to 15 deniers, while Chinese silk reeling mills should specialize in reeling coarse silk of 20 to 22 deniers. (D) Select special silk cocoons for use in North China and Japan. (E) The export inspection and control of raw silk in North China shall be handled by the "Central China Development Corporation." (F) Hand-reeled silk should be encouraged, and efforts should be made to promote new uses for silk cocoons. A separate company will be established in the future to manage the production of special cocoons. (G) The sericulture industry in Shanxi will adopt the same policy as Central China.</p>
<p>(7) On December 28th last year, the "Central China Gas Company" was established. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation," Shanghai Hengchan Company, Hiroshima Gas Co., Ltd., Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., etc. contributed 2.5 million yuan, paying a quarter of it first, and using the plundered Chinese industrial assets, converted into 500,000 yuan, to fill the remaining shares. The people in charge of the company: Managing Director Toyoshima Aimei (former director of Hiroshima Gas Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), Director Chen Shaoqi (managing director of Shanghai Hengchan Company), Ishikura Kichiji (former managing director of Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), Supervisor Fei Mingyu.</p>
<p>(8) To control the shipping industry on the Yangtze River, the "Yangtze River Shipping Company" was established. It was founded on December 10th last year with its head office in Shanghai. It has not yet started business. The amount of capital is unknown. The "Central China Development Corporation" and Nisshin Shipping Company, Dalian Steamship Company, etc. invested in it, and plundered the wharves of Chinese shipping companies along the Yangtze River as capital to monopolize all shipping operations at various ports along the Yangtze River, owning 16 riverboats and excluding British shipping companies.</p>
<p>(9) Seizing Shanghai's real estate, the so-called "Reconstruction of the War Zone," the "Shanghai Hengchan Company" was established on September 1st last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 2 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 1 million yuan. To seize the public land and real estate of the former Shanghai Municipal Government, etc., converted into 1 million yuan, to fill half of the capital. It is said that the company will start with Shanghai and plan to build urban areas, roads, and ports, etc., in order to transform Shanghai and control the concessions.</p>
<p>(10) Seize the fish production along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and establish the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." It was established on November 6th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 1.33 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 1 million. The remaining 330,000 was used to plunder the industrial assets of the Shanghai Fish Market, etc., and convert them to pay for it. The company engages in the wholesale market and sales business of aquatic products, as well as the capture of fishing vessels and nets, and the business of refrigeration and transportation.</p>
<p>(11) On July 25th last year, the "Shanghai Fish Market Association" was established with a capital of 100,000 yuan, and the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." were two in one, monopolizing the local fish industry.</p>
<p>As for other aspects in Central China that have been controlled, but no agency has yet been established, such as (1) Railways, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Jiangnan Railways, are being repaired by engineers dispatched by the Japanese Military Railway Section, the Japanese Railway Department, and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and will be operated by the "Central China Development Corporation." (2) Coal mines, planning to mine the Huainan coal mine, Changxing coal mine, etc., coal is already being transported to Japan. (3) Radio broadcasting, the "Greater Shanghai" and "Greater East Asia" have been established, and they plan to use puppet organizations to control the Shanghai Chinese Chamber of Commerce Radio Station. (4) Tobacco, such as Toyo Tobacco Leaf Company, East Asia Tobacco Company, Gongsheng Tobacco Company, etc., seize Chinese cigarette factories. (5) In terms of agricultural production, agencies have been established in the interior to control purchases, such as cotton. The Association of Japanese Textile Factories in China and the traitorous agency Citizens Association established a control agency in Shanghai, and after receiving a procurement license from the Japanese military, they sent personnel to establish offices in various counties to control purchases and prohibit "private sales." The flower collection offices established by Chinese textile factories in the interior have been forced to withdraw. For example, rice is purchased in Songjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, and other places, and shipped for export, amounting to no less than several million dan. (6) In the shipbuilding industry, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan seizes the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department to repair warships, and occupies the machinery of the Sanbei Hongchang Taixing and other three factories. The Japanese army occupied the Pudong Laogong Mao Dinghai Bridge and the two factories of Da Zhonghua, and Nisshin occupied the five factories of Caili Longchang Hengchang Xiang Hongxiang and China Merchants Inland River Machinery. (7) Cement, textiles, flour, etc., were seized separately by the Japanese side under the instigation of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>4. Connection with Japanese Trading Companies</p>
<p>The subsidiaries mentioned above are the agencies that directly plunder China. They are subordinate to the "Central China Development Corporation," the "national policy company." The "Central China Development Corporation," representing the Japanese government, naturally participates in the organization of each subsidiary, and the rest are jointly organized by Japanese trading companies to plunder the Huili industry and supply its exploitation. These have been mentioned above. For the sake of clarity, a table is made below:</p>
<p>5. Various Industries Plundered</p>
<p>Before the war, there were about 1.38 million spindles and 14,700 looms in the Chinese textile factories in Central China. Currently, about 600,000 spindles and 5,300 looms have been occupied and utilized by the Japanese. There are a total of 37 factories.</p>
<p>Regarding the plundering of cement plants, according to the Shen Bao Commercial News, of the ten Chinese cement plants in the country, only one remains in the hands of the Chinese. The nine in the Japanese-occupied area have all been seized. Among them, there are three in North China, two in South China, and four in Central China.</p>
<p>Central China is a silkworm production area, and the Japanese have long coveted it. In the past, when it was impossible to obtain it, they repeatedly sold inferior silkworm seeds to our country in an attempt to harm it. After August 13th, the silk cocoon producing areas in the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China, such as Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Haining, Deqing, and other places, were all occupied. Since the establishment of the so-called "Central China Silk Company," all of them have been invaded and operated. Among those occupied, there are three factories in Shanghai, with 708 silk reeling machines, nine factories in Wuxi, with 2,554 silk reeling machines, nineteen factories in Suzhou, with 3,656 silk reeling machines, and twenty-two factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Haining, with 4,030 silk reeling machines, totaling 10,948 machines in more than 50 factories.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Central China Silk Company" also occupied cocoon banks and silkworm seed manufacturing plants. There are 214 in the occupied area of Jiangsu Province, including 26 in Wuxian County, 99 in Wuxi, 1 in Changshu, 2 in Wujiang, 1 in Kunshan, 1 in Taicang, 19 in Jiangyin, 20 in Wujin, 8 in Yixing, 3 in Jintan, 10 in Danyang, 10 in Liyang, 1 in Lishui, 1 in Dantu, 1 in Gu Rong, and 5 in Yangzhong and 2 in Jiangna.</p>
<p>After the Chinese flour mills in Central China were occupied and started operation, four factories in Shanghai, such as Fuxin No. 3 Factory, were occupied and operated by the "Japanese Flour Milling Association" jointly run by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. There are five factories in Wuxi: Fuxin, Maoxin, Guangfeng, Guangqin, and Jiufeng. Except for Huafeng, which is operated by the Japanese firm Yoshida, most of them are operated by the "Japanese Flour Milling Association." There is the Yangtze River Flour Mill in Nanjing, which is occupied by the Japanese Sato Koichi.</p>
<p>The cigarette market in the guerrilla areas of Central China is completely controlled by the Japanese. Using military force, it prohibits Chinese cigarette companies and Central Tobacco companies from transporting cigarettes into the interior, and uses tobacco monopolized from Anhui Province, and seizes the Chinese cigarette factories in the occupied area, occupying and starting operations without paying unified taxes. The inferior goods produced in bulk are dumped into the interior, and the market is completely occupied.</p>
<p>There were more than a dozen paper mills in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and other places in Shanghai. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, most of the factories were occupied by the Japanese. Then, the Japanese attempted to lure the authorities of each factory to cooperate with the Japanese and resume operations, but all the factories, based on righteousness, decided to sacrifice themselves and unanimously refused. Seeing that the Japanese were not successful in luring them, they occupied all the factory buildings and machines and prepared to start operations.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other factories that have been seized by the Japanese, which can be seen in the "A Heartbreaking History of Chinese Commerce" in the Commercial News of this newspaper (see this newspaper on December 27th last year), and many factories have sent letters stating that they have not cooperated with the Japanese and that it is definitely a robbery.</p>
<p>6. A Final Thought</p>
<p>I have finished writing this thing after gathering the materials I have now. Of course, we have seen the great national industry suffer from plunder, which is an undeniable loss. We have also seen the other party's future conspiracy within their so-called "Central China Revival Company." We don't need to be terrified. We want to see if they have that ability? And look at the capital of this "Central China Revival Company," nominally 100 million Japanese yen, the first phase only collected 31,382,344 yuan. Except for the Japanese government reluctantly contributing 18,882,344 yuan (cash is only 11,242,344 yuan), the remaining private shares are only 12.5 million yuan, and it took a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, to be raised from 9,770 people. This is a truly and sincerely true fact, which proves that their people are not interested in this. Moreover, the development of many affairs in China is not only useless to their domestic industry, but also suffers from the influence of the reverse. It has already been discovered. Therefore, we must see through this point, and I hope that the authorities of our various industries must earnestly fulfill: (1) Be tough and sacrifice to the end, (2) Never be lured or threatened to cooperate with the Japanese puppets. In this way, let's see what the other party can do, and the industries that you have occupied can also be completely returned to Zhao on the day of final victory.</p>
<p>Of course, we have also seen factory owners who uphold justice and firmly refuse to "cooperate" (I want to mention one here, such as Yan Qingxiang, the owner of Suzhou Dalong Iron Factory and Sulun Yarn Factory. He suffered from Japanese enticement, but he was arrested and threatened, but as a result, he still refused and went to the Southwest. This is a representative.) But we have also seen many who are willing to be used and cooperate with the other party, such as the silk factories in Wuxi, which is an example. (Here, the reporter also gives an example, that is, a famous Nantong yarn factory in the country willingly cooperated with Japan to start operations. It actually hung the sun and the five-color flag on its roof, and supplied the other party with hundreds of thousands of dollars every month. Once, when I went to visit the truth of the factory, a representative of the factory in Shanghai also tacitly admitted it. It is said that the factory was mortgaged to a German businessman, so why not move it? Why should you supply the other party with huge sums of money? The man shook his head and smiled, seemingly expressing: First, the procedures are too difficult, and second, because I still want to make a fortune.)</p>
<p>In addition to the above actions, we must also take active actions, which we hope for the military and political organizations in the guerrilla areas. We must use sabotage work, like the mineral production in Shanxi, to make it impossible to mine. This destructive work does not have to be of any great importance, that is, we must find a way to make it impossible to start work and excavation. If the other party has no ability on the one hand, and cannot use people, and has many difficulties on the other hand, then what can they do if they catch it? (The end)</p>

<h3>Outlook on Japan's Huge Military Budget</h3>
<p>Recently, a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo informed us that the Japanese cabinet has already compiled a special military budget for this year, to be submitted to the Diet for review in mid-February. The total military expenditure has already exceeded 725.3 million yen. Superficially, this number seems quite large, but it contains deception and weaknesses. Firstly, this military budget is insufficient for troops stationed in China; secondly, there is no surplus for simultaneous operations against the Soviet Union; and thirdly, it is unimaginable to prepare for confrontation with Britain and the United States by expanding shipbuilding plans. The depression of Japanese militarists is indeed bitter! A brief analysis is given below:</p>
<p>Firstly, let's analyze the expenses of the army in China. The Japanese Ministry of the Army presents its military expenditure in the form of budget and special expenses, amounting to approximately 4.9 billion yuan. From this amount, two aspects of expenses must be deducted: firstly, the funding for the last two or three months of the previous year was not secured and must be drawn from this year's budget; secondly, the Manchurian Incident expenses, previously listed in the regular budget, are now included in the special budget. Even without considering these two points, the total amount is insufficient for the current army operating in central China. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in the central part of China is estimated to be at least one million. According to general estimates, the daily expense per person was 8 jiao during the Sino-Japanese War, 2.4 yuan during the Russo-Japanese War, and 3.6 yuan during the Sino-German War. Now it is approximately five times that of the Sino-German War, about 17.5 yuan. Calculated on this basis, Japan's annual army expenditure should be over 6.38 billion yuan. The surface budget for this year is already short by 1.4 billion yuan, let alone the subsequent needs which will certainly exceed the above listed minimum unit as the battlefield expands! This is the first weakness of Japan's military budget.</p>
<p>Secondly, in this Japanese military budget proposal, it boasts of including expenses for preparing for simultaneous operations against China and the Soviet Union. Its expenditure items include: (1) maintaining the strength of Japanese troops in China; (2) increasing the strength of Japanese troops stationed in the puppet Manchukuo; (3) expanding air force strength; and (4) improving Japan's military supplies. This is an extreme lie, deceiving its parliament, political parties, and the public. The troops fighting in central China are estimated to be at least one million, and the scope of operations is constantly expanding. This fixed number cannot be reduced. Then, the troops needed to cope with the Soviet border must be drawn from within the country, which will increase the number of soldiers "going to war" and, of course, the military expenditure will increase accordingly. How will the Japanese militarists include the military expenditure for preparing for war against the Soviet Union in this year's special budget?</p>
<p>Again, the most vulnerable aspect of Japan's military budget for this year is the naval expenditure budget. The total amount is only 1.85 billion yuan, a very slight increase compared to the 1.72 billion yuan of the previous year; the regular expenditure portion has actually decreased by 27 million yuan. Although there is some increase in contingency and special expenses, it is insufficient to speak of expanding the navy and building new naval bases to compete with Britain and the United States in the Pacific. As Japanese Navy Minister Yonai said, "Britain and the United States are now actively expanding their military forces. If Japan wants to control nearby waters, it must have a large-scale shipbuilding plan." Furthermore, as the booklet previously published by the Japanese Navy Ministry stated, the naval equipment of Britain and the United States in the Pacific will become an overwhelming force and take a surrounding posture against Japan. Then, Japan's mere 1.2 billion yuan budget for contingency and special expenses this year is very far from the so-called shipbuilding plan and the wishful thinking of expanding the navy. We have heard that the Japanese navy, firstly because it is competing with the army for credit, and secondly because it fears the oppression of the British and American navies, is vigorously advocating strengthening the naval base in the Pacific. The first step is to occupy various strongholds on the South China coast, but due to military expenditure and occupation costs, no decision has been made for a long time. Now, seeing the weakness of the Japanese naval military expenditure, the invaders will only be able to sigh at the ocean. The Tokyo correspondent of the German Frankfurter Zeitung commented that Japan's invasion of China is "beyond its reach," which contains deep meaning. Its strength is not only "beyond the reach of the Chinese mainland," but also "beyond the reach" of the coast. The fate of the invaders has become so miserable!</p>
<p>However, the core of Japan's financial crisis still lies in the revenue side. The Japanese people's burden for this huge finance is that increasing taxes has no power, and selling public bonds has no way. The Japanese people's annual income is estimated to be at most 16 billion yuan, and the military expenditure burden alone for this year has taken away nearly half. How miserable their national life will be is not in the eyes of the crazy invaders, but how will these people cope with their finances being on the verge of bankruptcy?</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 9th] Reports indicate that intense guerrilla warfare is occurring in central Hebei. The ×3rd Division recklessly swept through Mancheng, Hejian, and Pingxiang.

<h3>All Highways in Guangdong Province Will Open to Traffic Soon</h3>
<p>[Continental News Agency, Qujiang Express] After Guangdong Province fell into a wartime state, inland transportation was greatly hindered, resulting in local products being unable to be transported out and the needs of various places being unable to be obtained from the outside, thus causing soaring prices and affecting people's lives. In order to facilitate travel and rectify commercial transportation, so that inland industry and commerce can develop mutually, in addition to the direct passenger vehicles on the Shao-Mei Line (from Shaoguan to Meixian) organized by the Highway Department in the middle of last month, but with few cars and many people, it was even more impossible to transport goods. It is specially planned to jointly operate all highways in the province by the government and businesses, and a large number of cars will be dispatched on each main line, so that traffic throughout the province can be unimpeded, and great assistance will also be obtained in political and economic terms. It is reported that this move is already in progress and should be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Our Political Figures Discuss the Current Situation of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 9th] Chinese political figures here yesterday discussed the current military, political, economic, and social situation of the Chinese government with a Reuters interviewer, solemnly declaring:</p>
<p>Reiterating the Determination to Resist</p>
<p>There can be no direct peace talks between China and Japan. Only a Far East international conference similar to the Second Washington Conference can resolve the current Sino-Japanese conflict. They believe that Japan is very eager to end the current war, but Japan must insist on the conditions of the victor, and China can never accept these conditions. At the same time, Japan will also be unwilling to accept the conditions put forward by China. Therefore, it is expected that Japan will "launch another major offensive, and then prepare to negotiate peace, in order to obtain better peace conditions." × Soldiers are Powerless</p>
<p>In recent weeks, news of battles has been frequently reported in Shaanxi, western Hubei, and southern Guangdong, but there has been no major military development. According to reliable Chinese sources, the Japanese army has secretly withdrawn a large number of troops from the Yangtze River area, and Japanese troops in Hankou, Jiujiang, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places have also been withdrawn. At the same time, it is heard that most of the Japanese troops in South China have also been withdrawn. The Chinese military headquarters recently believes that the Japanese army has no intention of launching a new offensive in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, or Guangxi. The current activities of the Japanese army in China seem to be an attempt to capture Zhengzhou, with the obvious purpose of peering at Tongguan in the west in order to invade Xi'an, Shaanxi. This activity has no military effect, because the future activities of the Japanese will be purely to enhance political influence. However, the impact of this activity on the future is of great concern here.</p>
<p>Impact of the European Situation on the Future</p>
<p>At the same time, it is generally believed that the future of the current war will largely depend on the European situation. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France both have a chance of winning, then China will also actively counterattack and strive for final victory on its own. Conversely, if Europe compromises, then international pressure may force both China and Japan to end the war through negotiations. The speaker continued that the development of today's international situation has undermined all the common principles of international trade. Although the London economic community is advocating free trade with China against all opposition, China can only engage in exchange trade with foreign countries, that is, China can only exchange domestic goods for foreign munitions.</p>
<p>General Domestic Situation</p>
<p>Referring to China's economic situation, the spokesperson declared that the results of the current war have not caused any drastic changes. The Chinese people have reduced their economic needs and are supplying them with local products. At the same time, the Sino-Japanese war has not caused any drastic changes in Chinese society. The bourgeoisie and intellectuals are still in power in the government, while the working farmers are still the backbone of the army. The current Soviet aid to China has indeed enhanced the Soviet Union's position, but the intellectuals in power firmly believe that if China wants to establish lasting peace and reconstruction plans, cooperation with Britain and the United States is necessary. According to Reuters reporters, the Communist Party is not yet in a position to confront the Kuomintang in terms of status and power.</p>
<h3>Kunming Charity Sale Raises Over 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kunming, 8th Dispatch] The Kunming City business community's charity closed, raising over 30,000 yuan in national currency to contribute to the government's war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Jing Hengyi's Will: Donate Salary and Offer Money</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Chairman Lin recently received a report from Mr. He She, the son of the late Mr. Jing Hengtou, a member of the National Government, stating that in accordance with his father's will, he would donate all the salaries, etc., due but unpaid from September of the 20th year to September of the 27th year, to the government to repay the country.

<h3>The Postmaster of Beiping is Still Detained by the × Side</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing Day] Beiping News. The Postmaster of Beiping, Mr. Pu Lidi, has not been released since he was kidnapped in Xishan. According to sources in the Post Office, Mr. Pu Lidi is still being detained in Xishan.</p>
<h3>Intense Battles on the Northern Front; Silence South of the River; The Military Commission Announces Last Week's War Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Regarding the war situation this week, the reporter recently met with the spokesperson of the Military Commission, who gave the following statement. In the past week, the war situation on the northern and southern fronts has indeed been trending favorably for us. To mention the most important ones:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>The situation on the Yuehan and Guangjiu lines has not changed much. The × troops entrenched in the old Sanshui Kan Gang Yang Lao Xia Le Gang Zao Gang area have been continuously attacked fiercely by our army for days, annihilating many × troops. After being defeated, the remaining × troops collapsed and retreated to Sanshui, and each of these areas was officially recovered by us. Furthermore, the × troops in Shengang also launched a fierce joint attack with infantry and artillery on the afternoon of one day. After our brave resistance and repeated hand-to-hand combat, the × troops were almost completely wiped out. Now, we are taking advantage of the victory to encircle and attack the remaining × troops in Shengang. In the sea area around Fangcheng, Qiongya, and Weizhou Island in the south, there are about 30 × warships patrolling back and forth, without any action. However, the × troops have newly transferred two companies of chemical warfare units from Taiwan, carrying 40 tons of poison gas, and will definitely increase their × nature and plot to poison our officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>Central Hubei</p>
<p>After Yuekou and Tianmen were successively recovered by us in two weeks, the × troops from Jingshan and Yingcheng returned to Zao City, and more than 2,000 people launched another fierce attack on Damen. Our army had the remaining prestige of the new victory and was extremely brave. After a fierce battle, the × troops were completely eliminated. The remaining × troops in Jingshan are still under the siege of our army, and the situation has become like a turtle in a jar. They are now rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs, attempting to resist stubbornly. In southern and northern Hubei, the × formations of our troops remain in a stalemate, with no change. Although the × troops intend to hold on desperately to the outer perimeter of Wuhan, under the attack of our army from all directions, it will be difficult to achieve their wishes.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>The × troops from various routes have intensified their attacks on us in the past week, but our loyal and brave men have been able to create great battle results with their great spirit of selflessness. After the failure of the × troops in Xinan to attack Zhongtiao Mountain, more than 2,000 × infantry and cavalry from Huoxian, attached with more than ten mountain field guns, again attacked us in three routes. Our army retreated in Youtou at different times. Later, our main force arrived in large numbers and counterattacked bravely, and finally defeated the stubborn × troops, killing 5-600 × troops. The remaining × troops fled northward, and we officially recovered Liaoxian on one day. We are now continuing to counterattack towards Heshun, and the × troops are panicking and intend to flee. In addition, we also had battles with the × troops in Wutai in northern Shanxi and Wenxi, Lingshi, Xiaxian, and Yuxiang in southern Shanxi. The × troops failed to achieve their goals. In the battle of Yuxiang, a certain commander of the × troops was killed by us again, and the morale of the × army has been shaken to the extreme.</p>
<p>Hebei, Shandong, and Henan</p>
<p>The × troops in the three provinces have been vigorously attacking our guerrilla areas north of the Yellow River recently. Our officers and soldiers have been able to match hundreds with one, and their reputation is very strong. We have given the × troops the strongest and fiercest blow. In the Da Zhao area, 500 × troops were annihilated. In the Battle of Qinyang, thousands of × troops were killed, causing the × troops to flee in embarrassment. We fiercely attacked Yangzao Village and other places. The × troops suffered heavy losses and released a large amount of suffocating poisonous gas to help the battle. Our reinforcements divided and flanked them from the north and south. The × troops were greatly weakened, and they are still in a stalemate in the area east of Liwangjia Guanya Bottom, continuing to fight fiercely. The × troops in eastern Shanxi have increased to more than 5,000 and attacked us southward from Heshun in three routes. Because the × troops released a large number of poisonous gas bombs, we temporarily withdrew.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui</p>
<p>The × troops in Huangshan, Yangjiadun, and Jiajiatao in the lower reaches of Dongliu launched an attack on our Chen place some days ago. We bravely met and are still fighting.</p>
<p>Jiangnan</p>
<p>Our × troops and × troops had a small-scale battle at Hexi near Changxing. Our cover position was once lost and then recovered after a counterattack. There is no change in the current formation.</p>
<p>In summary, the war situation this week is relatively intense on the northern fronts, while south of the river there are only sporadic battles. Our entire army and soldiers are determined to kill × and move forward bravely, and have indeed given the × troops a most serious blow to their invasion attempts. It is believed that their any conspiracies and tricks will never be realized.</p>
<h3>× Planes Bomb Nanchang; 23 Bombs Dropped in the Urban Area; Cultural and Religious Institutions Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Two × planes invaded Nanchang at 1:00 PM today and dropped 23 bombs in the urban areas of Yingzhi Street, Minde Road, and other places. The Huaguang Daily News Agency and the Youth Association were destroyed. Furthermore, in Tongxiang, Jinxian, Fengxin, Jing'an, and other counties on the morning of the 8th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, a × plane was discovered scouting.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of Our and × Military Expenditures Since the War of Resistance; × is Four Times Greater than Ours</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] Local evening newspapers reported that from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to January of this year, the Japanese military expenditures have reached 8.8 billion yen, while the Chinese military expenditures have been 2 billion Chinese yuan. When the war began, the price of the Japanese yen was exactly equal to that of the Chinese yuan, so the Chinese military expenditure is approximately equal to one-fourth of the Japanese military expenditure. Such a huge expenditure on the × side will inevitably lead to its collapse in the future.</p>
<h3>The Central Work of the Gansu Provincial Government; Promote Military Service; Step Up the Prohibition of Opium</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Gansu Provincial Government now takes military service and opium prohibition as the two major central tasks. Regarding military service, the Gansu Military Region has now been officially established, with Zhu Shaoliang concurrently serving as commander, and two division management areas have been established. The work is currently being stepped up. Regarding opium prohibition, opium cultivation throughout the province was banned last year, and opium smoking is now being banned. The provincial government stipulates that opium addicts under the age of 35 must quit opium smoking by the end of January of this year, and opium cessation centers are set up in each county to complete the total suppression of opium smoking in the province between this year and next year.</p>
<h3>Japan's Delusional Attempt to Co-opt Britain and the United States; Yonai Denies Building a Military Port in South China; Arita's Reply Attempts to Alienate Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Yesterday, Wednesday, Japanese Navy Minister Yonai replied at a meeting of the Lower House Committee that the Japanese Navy Department has no plans to build a permanent naval base in or near China, but refused to comment on the question of whether to rapidly occupy Hainan Island.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Tokyo News. × Foreign Minister Arita made extremely arrogant remarks in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives during the budget debate this afternoon. His main points were: (1) The government does not intend to immediately respond to the notes sent by the governments of Britain, the United States, and France; (2) The governments of Britain, the United States, and France will not take joint action on all issues; (3) Even if the three countries take joint action, the Japanese government does not want to attach importance to it. Arita continued that the Japanese government attaches great importance to the relations between Japan and Britain and Japan and the United States and is studying the issue of no text proposed to the governments of Britain and the United States. The authorities have not yet decided how to reply and when to reply. Regarding rumors that Britain and the United States are taking joint action against Japan, Arita said that since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Britain and the United States have not taken joint action. However, the notes recently submitted to Japan by the two countries have the same wording, and the verbal expressions of the ambassadors of the two countries to the Japanese government also have the same wording. Although the two ambassadors have stated that the two countries will take action after consultation, this cannot be considered a joint action of the two countries. At the same time, according to reports from various newspapers in Paris, France's note to Japan is not intended to be a joint action between France and Britain and the United States. Arita said that Britain and the United States lack common interests in the Far East, so the two countries will not take joint action, and even if the two countries take joint action, Japan does not need to attach importance to it.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 9th] Foreign news. According to political sources here, well-informed sources declared that Japan currently seems to have no intention of expanding the Anti-Comintern Pact to conclude a military alliance. Although representatives from Germany and Italy have discussed this matter with the government here, the Japanese government has not completely forgotten the idea of ​​reconciling with Britain and the United States. It is said here that if Japan signs a military agreement with Germany and Italy, it will inevitably arouse the animosity of the naval powers of Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Admiral Kanji Kato Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Tokyo News. Japanese Admiral Kanji Kato passed away at Atami at 2:32 AM on the 9th, at the age of 70.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Former Chief of Naval Staff and Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Kato died here yesterday, Thursday. Kato was born in 1881 and became famous for opposing the Anglo-American proposal to hold a naval conference in Washington in 1921.</p>
<h3>Chung Shan University Opens Today, Classes Begin on the 1st of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Minming, 8th] The new campus of National Chung Shan University in Zhengjiang is now ready, and it is scheduled to open on February 10th and start classes on March 1st. The Secretary-General of the school, Xiao Guanying, will go to to preside on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Textile Industry Conference; Representatives from Factories of Various Countries Participate; Discussing the Issue of Japanese Forcibly Occupying Factories</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai News. Capitalists of the Chinese textile industry convened a conference of textile industries in Shanghai yesterday and presented a report stating that the Zhentai Textile Factory on the banks of the Suzhou River was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army in Shanghai in December 1937. Later, it was transferred to the management of a certain Japanese yarn factory in Qingdao, and it is still in the hands of the Japanese and has not been returned to the capital side. The chairman of the conference, Gao Mesaer, said that the white side must think that the British authorities cannot guarantee the property of British expatriates, and it is regrettable that the people still do not have the right to use the yarn factory. To date, the Japanese side has not made any specific statement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Attack the Shanghai Municipal Council; Using Recent Assassination Incidents as an Excuse; Requesting Interference in the Police Detective System</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai Foreign News. Japanese newspapers here have been attacking the Municipal Council, claiming that the recent frequent assassination cases are caused by the Municipal Council's failure to suppress anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The Daily News said that although the Municipal Council has declared that it will suppress anti-Japanese elements, it has not yet arrested all the assassins. If the Municipal Council still "turns a blind eye" to the current situation, then the so-called improvement of the police detective system of the Municipal Council and other suggestions are all mere formalities. However, the Japanese newspapers did not state that half of the assassination cases in the past week occurred in the Japanese-occupied area, and the security problems in that area are usually the responsibility of the police of the puppet Dadao Municipal Government.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Beiping, 9th] According to a report from Tianjin yesterday, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China, Sugiyama, visited the area and abolished the restrictions on foreign concession commerce that had been in place for the past two months. The Japanese side implemented this restriction to prevent the anti-Japanese movement in the concessions from surging.</p>
<h3>Moving Towards the Bozeng Frontline</h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>—Eighth Travel Notes from Returning to Huizhou—</p>
<p>On January 9th, amidst a cold wind and light rain, we passed through Luo, spending the night at ×× Temple. ×× Temple is one of the five famous temples of Mount Luofu, with tall pines, slender bamboos, clear waters, and withered lotus flowers, making for excellent scenery. It is now the base of the First Guerrilla Brigade of Guo Jiang. Among the tall pines and clear waters stand soldiers armed with live ammunition, giving the impression that even famous mountains and ancient temples are armed.</p>
<p>The First Guerrilla Brigade is not a regular army. It was originally a training team of the Self-Defense Corps. However, during the period of the fall of Boluo, they gained a great reputation for their bravery and strength in the Xiangshui area, with special battle achievements. They have now been transferred here to take on frontline guard duties. The soldiers of the entire team are genuine farmers, with large arms, handsome physiques, and bronze-colored skin, forming a typical guerrilla force. As their brigade commander, Mr. Chen Shinan, said, although he is not familiar with infantry tactics, he has rich operational experience in guerrilla warfare. When they fire their guns, they don't know how many meters it is. They just treat the × people as a wild boar, using the eyesight and skills of hunting wild boars. Once they fire within range, none fail to fall. Therefore, when the × people hear the sound of the nearby gun, they run away in terror, never daring to return. This is a beautiful tale among the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The deployment of our army on the Bozeng border line is to firmly grasp the East River and the provincial highway, forming an arc-shaped encirclement line from ×× to ××× towards Zengcheng's ×, commanded by Liang Zhu, the deputy commander of the East River Detachment. The command post is located in a small village near ×× Market. Deputy Commander Liang has not yet arrived, and it is currently being handled by Deputy Chief Xie. The next day at noon, the reporter rushed to visit and met Deputy Chief Xie in a quiet village house. We were already old friends, and now, shaking hands after a long absence on the front line of artillery fire, it was even more pleasant and exciting.</p>
<p>After we chatted casually for a moment, Deputy Chief Xie immediately took the reporter and a staff member Tan, carrying a map, and went up to a nearby hill to show the reporter the situation on the front line.</p>
<p>The Bozeng border area is indeed a very favorable guerrilla area. With Lizhi Ao blocked in front, our army occupies high ground, making it easy to attack; while the × people look up from below, making it difficult to advance. Even if the × people were able to pass through Lizhi Ao with the help of a large amount of air cover, the Luofu Mountains provide defense on the side, and they would inevitably be subjected to constant attacks by our guerrillas active in the Luofu Mountains, and be completely annihilated. In fact, every peak of the Luofu Mountains is a natural nest for guerrillas. As we looked at the undulating forests and valleys, as well as the guerrilla fighters, even the reporter couldn't help but...</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire East River line, the two points of Bozeng and Zenglong (Men) can support each other, directly flanking the back of Zengcheng. Separated from Shilong by the East River, a narrow strip of water, if properly used, can support the actions of Wanshi everywhere. Due to the importance of its position, coordinating with the counter-offensive of Zenglong and Wanshi, our army has repeatedly sloped out of Lizhi Ao to attack Zengcheng. The × people have now withdrawn their sentries to the side of the Duijiang Bridge, and the road to the left of Lizhi Ao has been destroyed and landmines have been laid to prevent the advance of our army. On the eve of our major counter-offensive, it can be seen that the × people are panicked and have few soldiers.</p>
<p>Having reached the front line, every day and every hour you can see low-flying reconnaissance × planes and the rumbling "reassurance cannons" fired by the × people—this is a popular term given to the × people by the soldiers. In order to avoid being discovered as a target, the teams at the front are mostly active in sugarcane fields or pine forests. As we walked along winding country roads, we would admire the faces of the soldiers with thick beards and sharp eyes in many swaying green bushes. Each of them waited with their guns, monitoring the plains at the foot of Mount Luofu. The morale was very high, and they did not relax their positions in the slightest.</p>
<p>The three market towns of Futian, Changning, and Lianhe are all within the border area and have been burned down by the × people during their retreat. The reporter passed through on the way back on the 13th and only saw the remnants of broken walls. Yangwu Mountain, five miles away from Jiaotian, when Boluo fell, the 152nd Division's Zhang Ruigui's troops once supported with two regiments of soldiers and fought with × at this place, with thousands of casualties on both sides. Broken clothes and scattered bones, how much is still left. Now that this vast battlefield has fallen into the hands of our army again, I think the soldiers, if they knew underground, would have no regrets. Recorded on January 30th in Huizhou</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Compatriots in Agony</h3>
<p>— Jun Ren</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Before reporting to the readers, I must first explain the source of the news: this was brought back from Taiwan by a friend named Shi. Mr. Shi has lived in Taiwan for a long time, doing business there, passed down through generations. When it came to my friend, Mr. Shi left his homeland and went there. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Shi initially couldn't bear to give up his business and stayed there. But recently, he encountered sufferings that he could no longer endure. He could no longer bear it, so he resolutely sold the business he was running and fled back to his homeland, arriving in Fuzhou and then Hong Kong. He brought me a lot of news about the suffering that our compatriots, whom we care about deeply, are enduring, and the stirring situation of the revolutionary situation in Taiwan.</p>
<p>My friend said: "Although I have been fortunate enough to escape the tiger's mouth and step into the country, I am still extremely concerned about my compatriots who are suffering the same hardships as me. They are still groaning under the iron heel, eagerly hoping that their compatriots in the country will lend a helping hand to save them from that terrible trap.</p>
<p>"There are still more than 57,000 overseas Chinese residing in Taiwan; their actions are simply completely deprived of freedom, and they have suffered all kinds of hardships. Japanese police officers inspecting the homes of overseas Chinese is as common as a family meal. Some are inspected several times a day, turning over boxes and searching at will. This is the so-called way to "strictly prevent rebellion." When walking on the road, they are also subject to inspection in the same way, at every important transportation route. Overseas Chinese are restless. In order to reduce trouble, many people have changed to wearing Western clothes. Because if you wear a Chinese-style jacket, it is easy to be recognized as a "Chinese" marker, inspected every ten steps, checked every hundred steps, making you unable to cope and dizzy. This is not a big deal, but if you are not careful for a moment, sometimes even some extremely minor things will lead to accusations of "groundless" crimes, which is truly chilling!</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the personnel of our country's consulate in Taiwan have also lowered their flags and returned home. In this way, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese are like soulless bodies, with everything gone. The Chinese Association was forced to hang the five-colored puppet flag. The lovely national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth can no longer appear before the eyes of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in this situation not only suffer physical pain, but also suffer great mental stimulation.</p>
<p>"Currently, more than 7,000 to 8,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan are unemployed. They all want to return to their homeland, but because they have no travel expenses, they have no choice but to stay there with heartache. Their experiences, I think, are sympathized with by the people of the country! However, there is one more point to note: even if some overseas Chinese have money to return home (I am one of them), they will be subject to all kinds of exploitation before they can travel. According to the prohibition of the Japanese government in Taiwan, each person is not allowed to take more than one hundred yuan out of the country. If the amount is exceeded, it will be confiscated. Think about it, one hundred yuan is simply a drop in the bucket besides the travel expenses. Therefore, overseas Chinese with a little property, even if they can return to their homeland, will still be empty-handed, with heavy losses. Therefore, overseas Chinese currently residing in Taiwan are in a dilemma, feeling difficult to go or stay."</p>
<p>While saying this, Mr. Shi sighed. It is said that he lost more than 50,000 yuan in Taiwan this time when he returned home. Now that he has returned to the homeland, although everything is gone, he can always hear the true news of the Anti-Japanese War and say a heartfelt remark, which is much better than tens of thousands of overseas Chinese groaning in deep water and fire. Speaking of the recent situation in Taiwan, Mr. Shi also gave us a lot of valuable news. He said:</p>
<p>"Although the situation of overseas Chinese in Taiwan is miserable, the people of Taiwan are even more miserable than us. Since the outbreak of the war, Taiwan has conscripted soldiers many times, and most of the young people have been conscripted to China ××. Therefore, although young people have not disappeared from the streets of Taiwan, it is very rare to encounter one or two. If there are any, they are mostly disabled. Therefore, the scene is extremely desolate. As for the Taiwanese who were driven to China to fight, many were killed or wounded. The wounded were sent back to Taiwan one after another, but the government kept this very secret and rarely let the people know. The wounded were closed in the wounded soldiers' hospital, and were not allowed to go out or to be visited by relatives and friends. Those who gained a little freedom were only a few slightly injured soldiers who were walking on the street with extremely depressed looks. How many wounded soldiers are there in the wounded soldiers' hospital? The number is impossible to know, but it is known that the monthly supply costs a lot, and the people are a little shuddered.</p>
<p>"This huge supply expenditure is all borne by the people through monthly donations, which is a heavy burden. All the metals stored in the Taiwanese folk, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, have been requisitioned, so gold and silver shops have closed down one after another, and tin shops are also being banned. The number of unemployed workers has increased a lot, and leather shoes are absolutely forbidden to be manufactured. One month before I left Taiwan, a shoe store in Taipei privately manufactured a pair of leather shoes, which was discovered by the Japanese, and the result was a fine of 3,000 yuan. The strictness of the ban can be seen from this. At present, people wearing leather shoes can no longer be seen on the streets of Taiwan. All leather shoes have been issued for military use. Since leather shoes have been banned, clogs are very popular. Even wearing Western clothes, you also drag clogs, which can be said to be a miracle! Gold and silver in Taiwan must be sent to the bank to be exchanged for paper money. No one dares to wear gold rings anymore, but the Japanese government is still afraid that there will be omissions, so it has held a gold and silver registration, announcing notices everywhere, ordering the public to register with the government if they have gold and silver in order to be requisitioned at any time.</p>
<p>"The people's donations are also enforced. Each family is issued a money jar, hung indoors. Everyone must pay a certain amount of money into the jar every day. At the end of the month, government officials are sent to collect the money from each household, and none can be missing. In addition to bearing many exorbitant taxes, they also have to cope with this "forced donation"! The people's wealth is exhausted, and they cannot bear the burden. They are crying out in pain, but the Japanese warlords are deaf to their cries. How can they imagine their plight!</p>
<p>"The people's suffering is getting deeper and deeper, and the thought of resistance is growing. Therefore, the ×× atmosphere in Taiwan is very strong, and the Taiwanese revolutionary party is also very active. At the same time, the Japanese government is also on guard for 'strictly preventing rebellion,' and arrests are made every day on suspicion. However, the ×× situation in Taiwan is still intensifying!"</p>

<h3>Italian Troops Open to Africa France Convenes Important Meeting Britain Decides to Make Every Effort to Promote Peace</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] The French Senate's Secret National Defense Committee held a meeting yesterday, attended by Prime Minister Daladier, Minister of the Navy Camponchi, and Minister of Shipping Rabo, who reported on the overall situation. The meeting will continue until Friday. This committee is composed of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Defense Credit Control Sub-Committee. It has only met once during the Great War. What is noteworthy is that this meeting is never easily convened unless the overall situation is critical, and the fact that it is being held now is clearly related to the tense relations between France and Italy.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] Sources close to the situation claim that French Prime Minister Daladier, at the secret meeting of the National Defense Committee on Tuesday afternoon, declared to the public that General Gamelin, the current Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, will soon receive special authority and be promoted to Marshal. General Georges will be promoted to Chief of the National Defense Staff to share General Gamelin's labor. According to the French Prime Minister's declaration, there has been no official announcement, as the decision must be approved by the cabinet, but it is expected that this agreement will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] British Labor Party members asked the Prime Minister in the House of Commons yesterday what attitude the government has towards convening a world peace conference to remedy the current economic and political situation that is heading towards war. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that Britain is making every effort to promote preparations for convening a world peace conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jiboto, 8th] According to sources here, Italian troops and planes are now concentrating in Jige. Jige is located thirty miles west of British Somaliland and one hundred and twenty-five miles south of French Somaliland.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] It is reported that Italy has transferred a unit of troops to Tripoli and Libya in Africa in recent weeks. The Italian official does not deny this. When British and Italian officials exchange military intelligence next time, the Italian side will report the details to the British side. According to the provisions of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the two countries originally had the obligation to exchange military intelligence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Well-informed sources recently stated that after Italy dispatched 30,000 troops to its North African colony of Libya a few days ago, it will send another 30,000 troops in the coming days to strengthen its defenses. Those responsible in Britain said that France has a significant military force stationed in North Africa, which is enough to prevent Italy from recklessly invading French Tunisia. Although Italy's repeated increase in troops to Libya is intended to raise the number of troops stationed there to be equal to that of France, the threat to Britain is at least equal to that to France. Therefore, the threat to Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the future is the same as the situation when Italy repeatedly increased troops to Libya before the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain just made a declaration in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, stating that when France encounters a threat, no matter where the threat comes from, Britain will provide France with full assistance. The Italian government is increasing troops to Libya at this time. This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] During the British House of Commons question time today, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to Labor MP Mr. Henderson that according to a telegram received from the Italian government, there are about 30,000 to 32,000 Italian troops in Libya. A Labor MP raised a supplementary question, "Is the government aware of reports that Germany recently sent troops to Libya?" The authorities did not answer this question. Sir Sinclair then asked whether the Anglo-Italian Agreement stipulated that Italy would withdraw 1,000 troops from Libya every week, and whether Italy had complied with this. The Prime Minister replied that he still needs to inquire about this issue and could not answer it at the moment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th] The Army authorities recently issued an order to the whole country that reservists born in 1906 and 1907, including Austrian citizens who have not performed military service, should enlist for training from March 28th to May 31st.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Mediate Spanish Peace Italy Makes Another Guarantee to France Volunteers Will Be Withdrawn After the End of the Spanish War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The cabinet held a meeting this morning, focusing on the Spanish issue. It is heard that Prime Minister Chamberlain advocated intensifying the ceasefire talks with both sides of the civil war. It is said that the ceasefire conditions proposed by Spanish Prime Minister Negrin include three main points: (1) Volunteer soldiers from all countries within Spain should be withdrawn; (2) The rebel authorities should provide guarantees that no retaliatory measures will be taken against government personnel; (3) The future political system of Spain should be decided by a public referendum or election. It is heard that Franco has accepted the first two items, but firmly rejected the third item. Well-informed sources here said that the ceasefire negotiations may proceed unexpectedly smoothly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] French non-official ambassador to Burgos, Bilah, returned to Paris yesterday to report on his talks with Spanish rebel government Foreign Minister Chudan and Franco's subordinates.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 8th] Authoritative sources say that the Italian government has made a guarantee to the French government, stating that after the Spanish National Army achieves complete victory and the Spanish War ends, Italy will withdraw its troops from Spain and will not interfere in Spain's internal affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 9th] Poland has given de facto recognition to the Spanish National Army government. It is believed that it will soon be formally recognized. At that time, Poland will send a trade delegation to Burgos to negotiate trade agreements.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on the Spanish War</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Daily Mail commented on the Spanish war today, "If London and Paris's mediation of the Spanish war can achieve something, countries around the world will be pleased. The Spanish government army can hardly continue to fight. Its only hope is to avoid total collapse and obtain a glorious peace. Franco's control of Spain is about to be completed, because after capturing Barcelona, he can be expected to achieve final victory. General Miaja, the leader of the government army, has shown his courage for a year, and now is the opportunity to show his wisdom. His opinions are highly valued by Prime Minister Negrin. Franco now controls three-quarters of Spain. His government may be recognized by various countries. Spanish President Azaña and his cabinet's trip to France is enough to indicate that they can no longer rule Spain. It is expected that the British and French governments will not consider recognizing the Franco government until foreign troops inside and outside Spain are withdrawn. Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini guaranteed that Italian troops would be withdrawn after the Spanish War stopped."</p>
<p>Spanish President and Others Go to Paris</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Le Boulou, France, 8th] Spanish Republican Government Prime Minister Negrin arrived here, and government army generals have established a temporary headquarters in France. However, the French government previously notified Negrin that Spanish government personnel cannot establish government offices in France. It is not yet known whether the French authorities will allow the Spanish government to do so.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] Spanish President Azaña arrived here from Geneva this morning. Representatives from the French Foreign Ministry and the Spanish Ambassador to France welcomed him at the station. According to reliable sources, Spanish Prime Minister Negrin may resign due to disagreements with President Azaña on continuing the war. This morning, some newspapers advocated that France should immediately recognize Franco's government in order to quickly resolve the Spanish issue.</p>
<p>Rebel Troops Arrive in Grasse</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Today, the Spanish government army accelerated the withdrawal of troops from Catalonia. These troops are now entering France in the town of Bourg-Madame, and are crossing the border in full force, unlike the previous small teams entering the country. Since 4 pm yesterday, it is estimated that 8,000 soldiers have arrived in Bourg-Madame. All have been disarmed. An entire battalion of officers and soldiers arrived at the border, totaling 600, along with dozens of trucks and 50 mule-drawn carts. The 16th Division, composed entirely of government partisans, arrived in Pusada tonight. It is said that the government army retreated in good order, with tanks in the rear. Almost all the artillery was taken away.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Perpignan, 8th] The border between France and Spain has been strengthened to cope with the influx of refugees. This afternoon, the fortress of Figueras was blown up. The explosion was very powerful, but it is not known whether this was accidental or deliberate. A few days ago, the basement of the fortress was used as an office by the Spanish cabinet and various ministries. The fortress became the target of rebel aircraft bombing. Currently, the rebels are advancing towards Figueras under the resolute resistance of the government army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Perpignan, 9th] An Associated Press reporter visited a concentration camp near Amelie-les-Bains today. There is a road connecting the camp with the front line, and refugees are constantly flowing along the road. Men, women, old and young, and the wounded are transported to the concentration camp by horse-drawn carts. Along the way, there are some who are frozen and starving, and who collapse on the roadside. The scene is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Grasse, 8th] After the rebel troops reached this city tonight, the Italian army units that accompanied the rebels to advance towards the French border have been transferred from the front line to the rear.</p>
<h3>US Senator Suggests Limiting Armaments Writes to Secretary of State Hull</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Indiana Congressman Ludlow wrote to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting drafting a world naval holiday and limiting the expansion of international armaments. Not long ago, Rhode Island Senator William King declared that he intends to ask the Senate to pass a proposal requesting President Roosevelt to sign an international agreement on limiting armaments.</p>
<h3>Britain Urges Opening of the Pearl River Foreign Ministry Answers Questions from Parliamentarians Will Lodge a Serious Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Butler replied in the House of Commons yesterday to a question from Sir Waldron Smithers that the Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce had asked the British Consul-General in Guangzhou to forward a petition to the British government, asking the government to state its position on Japan's continued blockade of the Pearl River. This petition is under the government's urgent consideration and will soon be replied to by the appropriate authority in Hong Kong. The government is now taking all possible steps to promote the opening of the Pearl River. Opposition MP Mr. Alexander asked whether the government's note to Japan on opening the Pearl River could be expected to achieve more practical results than the note on opening the Yangtze River. Mr. Butler replied that the Japanese side may consider the Pearl River to be a military activity zone, so there must be considerable difficulties. The government will engage in serious negotiations with them as much as possible. Sir Waldron Smithers then asked whether it was not illegal for Japan to blockade the Pearl River if it was at war with China. Mr. Butler replied that we should consider all relevant facts. Regarding the fact that the Japanese side in Shanghai is not allowing the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to dredge the Huangpu River, negotiations are currently underway and some progress has been made. The Foreign Secretary has not heard a report on the blockage of the Huangpu River waterway. Mr. Waldron Smithers then asked whether the government could give the Japanese government some more pressure for the sake of Britain and other countries. The Foreign Secretary replied that the government has solemnly stated this view during the Shanghai negotiations.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Invade Soviet Border Again; Two Attacks Repelled; Soviet Union Lodges Another Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] A public statement issued here recently states that Soviet border guards clashed again with Japanese "Manchukuo" troops on the Erguna River. Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" troops were killed and one wounded, while two Soviet guards were killed and two wounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Soviet authorities announced today that Japanese troops attacked Soviet Island No. 227 on the 6th and 7th of this month. The island is located in the Erguna River (one of the sources of the Heilongjiang River, where the Hulun Buir River in Heilongjiang Province turns north and becomes the Erguna River). In the first attack, five Japanese "Manchukuo" troops were killed or wounded. In the second attack, 400 Japanese "Manchukuo" troops first attacked Soviet border guards with machine guns and rifles. The Soviet guards immediately returned fire and repelled the Japanese troops. Ten Japanese troops were killed or wounded, including one officer. On the Soviet side, one was killed and two were wounded. On January 31, there was a clash between Japan and the Soviet Union, resulting in Soviet troops driving the Japanese troops out of Island No. 229. The location of the second incident this month is the same as the location of the January 31 incident. The Soviet government has instructed its chargé d'affaires in Japan to lodge another protest with Japan, stating that the Soviet Union had already lodged a protest last time. The Soviet authorities' statement mentioned the 1911 Sino-Russian Treaty, declaring that the island belongs to Russia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] Japan has lodged a protest with the Soviet government through its embassy in Moscow, citing the Soviet Union's "unjustified" opposition to Japan's coal mining rights in North Sakhalin as the reason. The coal mining area was transferred by the Soviet Union to Japan's Sakazaki Company in 1925, and then transferred to the North Sakhalin Coal Mining Company in 1937. According to Japan, the Soviet Union had requested the return of the coal mine, but in April of last year, it again expressed its willingness to stop. Japan lodged the above-mentioned protest based on a Soviet newspaper report that the Soviet Union was mining in the area without notifying Japan.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Nageotte, Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] The newly appointed French Ambassador Nageotte has arrived here and has presented a copy of his credentials to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov.

In addition to the two 26,000-ton warships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, this ship is Germany's largest warship. Its G-type sister ship will also be launched in Wilhelmshaven soon.</p>
<h3>Irish Minister of Justice Proposes Bill to Parliament to Ban Extremist Groups</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dublin, 8th] The Irish Minister of Justice, Mr. Ruttledge, today proposed a bill to Parliament to ban extremist groups (such as the Irish Republican Army). The Labour Party leader, Mr. Norton, said that the Labour Party would oppose this bill, and said that the country has been peaceful in recent years as never before. Mr. Ruttledge said that a certain group issued a declaration last December, claiming the power transferred by other groups is not subject to government control, and the government cannot tolerate such provocative actions.</p>

<h3>Fire in Pampanga Province, Philippines; Losses of 50 Million Philippine Pesos</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, 9th] San Fernando, the capital of Pampanga Province, known for its sugar production, suddenly caught fire this morning at 8:00 AM. The fire spread from the city streets to the suburban buildings, burning fiercely. It was extinguished at 12:30 PM. The losses are estimated at approximately 50 million pesos (Philippine currency). Although there were no deaths or injuries, 3,000 people were left homeless.</p>
<h3>Burmese National Flag: Peacock on Blue Background; Approved by British King</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The British King has approved the adoption of a national flag by Burma, as he recognizes Burma as a unit of the British Empire. The flag is blue, with a peacock in the center, surrounded by a gold circle. Burma previously had no national flag; the peacock is its national emblem.</p>
<h3>The German-Japanese Spy Alliance (Continued)</h3>
<p>Later, in April, Wutang was ordered to go to France to assist Oshima in advancing the work.</p>
<p>Wutang is a retired naval officer and current director of Showa Steel Works. After he presented a Japanese group’s precious sword to Hitler, he disappeared. In fact, he was holding meetings with German military officers at Krupp!</p>
<p>The visit was quite satisfactory. Soon, a special brigade went to Germany. Most of these members were officers of the intelligence department. In June 1936, the Japanese intelligence department actually moved to Berlin. In Oshima's office, members of the Japanese special mission, representatives of the German intelligence department led by Nikolai, and Dr. Pötschke, the representative of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, met to discuss and decided to divide the world into two areas of espionage activity. The larger area was handled by German espionage, and the smaller area was handled by Japanese espionage.</p>
<p>However, Japan requested that Germany include the Soviet Union in the scope of Japanese espionage activities. After Germany agreed to this request, Colonel Oshima said to Major Walter: "If we bear all the expenses, would you be willing to operate in the United States?"</p>
<p>This sudden proposal made Major Nikolai hesitate. Before 1934, German military advisors in the Soviet Union collected considerable Soviet data, so Germany had a deep understanding of the Soviet military strength. In the United States, Nikolai's file only contained some materials collected during the peace conference during the European War. Germany has always paid little attention to the United States, so apart from a commercial espionage organization dedicated to exploring enterprise secrets, it has never done any work to explore military intelligence.</p>
<p>Later, espionage activities finally expanded to the United States.</p>
<p>In 1937, many German spies infiltrated various parts of the United States and carried out large-scale activities. At the same time, Japan transferred its spies in the United States to China and the East Indies. Therefore, only six major cities, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, and San Francisco, still have some Japanese spies operating.</p>
<p>Nikolai led his espionage work in the United States consistently, choosing Pelham Manor as his base and using the Europa as an important tool for transmitting letters, with Major Pfeffer in charge of all activities.</p>
<p>Recently, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested three male and one female suspects, all of whom were indirectly related to the Oshima-Nikolai spy network. They stole materials from the Seversky and Curtiss factories and supplied them to the Japanese side, so they were also subsidized by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Oshima and Walter always kept the German-Japanese alliance a secret. Very few people knew the inside story. Even the then German Foreign Minister Neurath was unaware of it. But soon after, the Soviet counterintelligence cracked this conspiracy. A branch of the Soviet counterintelligence organization, hosted by the famous spy Yechigan, was active in Paris. There was a Japanese special mission in Burgos. If anyone obtained information about the Soviet Union, they would hand it over to them. Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin received instructions from his country to present this matter to French Foreign Minister Delbos. The French General Staff was shocked and immediately convened a supreme military meeting in Paris. The Soviet military attaché also attended and reported to the conference.</p>
<p>The espionage agencies in Tokyo and Berlin, which had always been secretive, finally had their conspiracy exposed. Oshima, Walter, and others were naturally panicked. But in order to deal with France and the Soviet Union, they did not conceal it, but used a lightning-fast method to publicly expand the organization, saying that it was to deal with the Communist Third International. At the same time, in order to strengthen the strength of this organization, on November 26, 1936, Ambassador Mushanokoji to Germany and German Foreign Minister Neurath formally signed a draft agreement, concealing the true face of the spy alliance.</p>
<p>Behind the Anti-Comintern Pact, the German-Japanese spy alliance continued to exist. Now Japan's general intelligence agency for Europe and the United States is still in Berlin, namely the German intelligence department. At the same time, the German embassy in Japan has also become the general intelligence agency for German military affairs. Germany obtains information here from Doihara in his area, including China, Borneo, Australia, New Zealand, and the Soviet Far East. The Japanese intelligence budget has now increased to 12 million yuan per year, and this huge expenditure is used to pay for Nikolai's leadership in espionage in the United States.</p>
<p>The Japanese embassy in Berlin and the German embassy in Tokyo are less organs of diplomatic activity than exchanges for secret military intelligence! In April 1938, Walter, the creator of this spy alliance, was promoted to German Ambassador to Japan, and Oshima was also promoted to Japanese Ambassador to Germany.</p>
<p>It is rare in modern history for two spy leaders to occupy supreme power in the diplomatic field! (Translated by Min from KEN December issue)</p>
<p>Brief Comment</p>
<h3>World Peace Conference</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons the day before yesterday (the 8th) that "Britain is now working hard to promote the convening of a world peace conference, inviting all countries to participate, to resolve all economic and political problems that may cause war." In this land of烽火, will this clear call for peace touch the hearts of the aggressor kings?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, eliminating the爭干戈on the graceful conference table is the sincere wish of peace-loving people in the world, and the League of Nations and all non-war treaties, etc., all focus on this. Unfortunately, since Hitler's extraordinary experience and rise to power, a new world war has actually begun. Coupled with the calamities of the hypocritical, cowardly, and appeasement policies of the peace-loving and democratic countries, the League of Nations cannot effectively perform its duties. All peace agreements, such as the non-war treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty, have been torn to shreds, and international peace conferences outside the League of Nations mechanism, such as the Western non-intervention committees, have indulged fascist aggressors to do evil under the guise of peace and neutrality, resulting in today's Western war catastrophe!</p>
<p>Now, since President Roosevelt issued a statement to aid European democratic countries, the Soviet Union first responded with the fact of severing diplomatic relations with Hungary to打击 aggressors. The British and French authorities also have stronger expressions... Under the further threat of aggressors, the conditions for further unity and resistance of peace-loving and democratic countries are naturally more complete. Is the convening of a world peace conference in Chamberlain's mouth based on these conditions? If so, and if the countries participating in this conference can recognize (1) the Soviet Union as a pillar of world peace and (2) the implementation of a collective security system as a guarantee of world peace, then the convening of the conference and its future are not without hope. As for our China, although we hope that this world peace conference can be convened and complete its mission in the shortest possible time, we believe that such an achievement cannot come from fantasy, but must be promoted by adhering to the national united resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3>The Threat to Humanity</h3>
<p>Fascism is not only war, but also a threat to humanity. We can find iron evidence of the three fascist aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan crazily bombing, slaughtering, and destroying culture and absolute humanity in Abyssinia, Spain, and especially in various parts of China.</p>
<p>Moreover, fascism is trying to cover up this kind of cultural destruction and inhumane × behavior in many ways, so anyone who exposes this ugly × behavior of fascism from the standpoint of human justice is in danger of suffering extreme persecution. The Reuters Shanghai telegram on the 8th stated that Japan instigated the so-called "Fairness Association" to send threatening letters to American journalist A. T. Steele, etc., and even arrogantly announced the "death penalty" of righteous people such as British journalist Harold Timperley, American journalist Edgar Snow, and Ms. Agnes Smedley. Their ×× intimidation is not worth laughing at, but the threat to humanity can be said to be fully exposed.</p>
<p>Guardians of humanity, comrades-in-arms of justice, will never express surprise in front of this kind of ×× intimidation. No, they will carry out their sacred mission more bravely and more strongly. Although they will suffer shameless sneak attacks, they will receive the support of 450 million Chinese people and the righteous people of the working masses around the world.</p>

<h3>My International Prestige Gets Higher, Rumors Say My Government Borrows 60 Million from Hong Kong Banks</h3>
<p>Canton-Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce Cables Britain to Protect Interests in China; Resumption of Pearl River Navigation Difficult to Resolve; US Warship Has Stopped Coming to Hong Kong</p>
<p>My country launched a full-scale war of resistance, fighting for world peace and human freedom. Peace-loving people all over the world expressed their warm sympathy and provided assistance. Now, the full-scale war of resistance has entered its second phase. The military and civilians across the country have risen up together and become more united. The international situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, which is more harmonious with me. Previously, my country's consortia went to Britain and the United States to negotiate a loan successfully, and people's hearts became more excited. The final victory is not far away. According to the German-Japanese News yesterday, the Chinese government authorities recently negotiated with foreign banks in Hong Kong and China and succeeded again. The amount borrowed was 60 million Hong Kong dollars, which was borrowed from banks in Hong Kong and China, and was guaranteed by China. The process and success of this loan were the result of negotiations between the Chinese government and banks in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Western Chamber of Commerce Cables British Government to Protect British Interests in China</p>
<p>Also, since 粤领 Guangzhou, it has implemented a closed-door policy, trying to monopolize the Pearl River navigation rights. It has procrastinated in various ways regarding the issue of resuming navigation on the Pearl River. Recently, the Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce and the Shameen Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed the London China Association, asking them to pay attention to this issue and strongly demanding that the British government resolve the opening of various rivers in Guangdong and restore British rights in China in the shortest possible time. At the same time, the British Chamber of Commerce in China telegraphed London and demanded that the British authorities take a firm attitude to maintain their rights in China. After the report of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce arrived in London, the House of Commons paid close attention to it. Hong Kong can expect to receive a reply soon. Sir Qiluo, a member of the House of Commons, questioned the government about this. At that time, Mr. Butler, the secretary of the Foreign Office, replied on behalf of the government, saying that he had informed the consul-general in Guangdong, Bertie, of the situation, and was now awaiting Bertie's reply. The government is continuing to find ways to restore navigation on the Pearl River. Since Guangzhou was occupied by the Japanese army last October, foreign ships have not been allowed to navigate on the Pearl River. Later, Sir Qiluo again questioned the government whether it had considered that the Japanese had not declared war on China and whether they had the right to close the Pearl River. Bertie did not answer, but said that the government had carefully considered this matter.</p>
<p>British Parliament Discusses Resumption of Navigation Between Hong Kong and Guangdong</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce believes that the lack of access to the waterways of Guangzhou and the indefinite resumption have greatly affected the import of goods and caused deep concern. Recently, it suggested to Mr. Bertie, the British Consul General in Guangdong, that he submit a proposal to the British government, requesting that the × side explain the correct attitude towards the closure of the Pearl River. When the British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, answered the inquiry of Sir Jerome Milnes in the House of Commons Association the other day, he instructed the British Consul in Guangdong to forward the instructions to the Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Butler also said that since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou City last October, the waterways between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province have been blocked. The British government is now considering taking a possible step to seek the resumption of waterways. After Mr. Butler expressed his views, Labour MP Alexander Li asked whether the resumption of navigation this time would be faster than the results of the resumption of navigation on the Yangtze River. Mr. Butler replied that this was because the area was within the scope of Japanese military activities, so there were considerable obstacles, but the authorities were doing their best to negotiate this issue. In addition, the US naval authorities in Guangdong previously held negotiations with the × side in the US warship Mindanao. After some discussions, it was decided that on the 10th of this month (i.e. today, Friday), the × side would grant the convenience of opening the Pearl River, allowing the US warship Mindanao to sail from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. This news has now disappeared, because the × side is concerned that if it allows the US warship to sail this time, the requests of other countries will inevitably continue to be made, so it temporarily cancelled the decision to open the Pearl River lock.</p>
<h3>China Youth Relief Association Organizes Rescue Team to Serve in the Country; Fundraising Play at Ko Shing Theatre Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Hong Kong China Youth Relief Association has been working hard on fundraising and disaster relief. At this time of national crisis, in order to mobilize the rear, strengthen the front-line war of resistance mechanism, and promote the spirit of overseas Chinese youth serving the motherland, the association members increasingly believe that it is necessary to organize a rescue team to return to the country to serve. Therefore, at the third member meeting on the 29th of last month, all members voted to pass the resolution to organize the first batch of rescue teams to return to the country to serve and depart for the ×× Group Army in Beijiang to participate in front-line work. Regarding the expenses for departure and medicines, the Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs agreed to raise funds through performances, and the famous Hong Kong gentlemen and businessmen Li Xingqu and Gao Fushen sponsored the association as honorary presidents. The performance date has been set for February 11, 1939 (matinee film, evening drama and others). Matinee at 2:00 PM, evening at 7:30 PM, location at Ko Shing Theatre. Ticket prices are 15 cents, hand, 50 cents, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 毫, 5 yuan (honorary seat 10 yuan), (honorary box 50 yuan). The matinee includes three films: Battle of Taierzhuang, Melee, and Anti-Japanese War Special. The evening includes (1) Thunderstorm directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian (performed free of charge by the China Art Troupe), (2) Hawaiian Xylophone by famous musician Chen Deguang, (3) Classical dance performed by Miss He Wanyi and He Wanduan, (4) others. In addition, the association issued a declaration to young people from all walks of life to solicit members and increase strength.</p>
<h3>The Weather Has Suddenly Turned Cold in Recent Days; The Lowest Temperature Yesterday Was 55 Degrees</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, the weather in Hong Kong has suddenly turned cold. The highest temperature was only 59 degrees Fahrenheit, which was 6 degrees lower than the previous day, and the lowest temperature dropped to 55 degrees. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the temperature in Hong Kong remained at 59 degrees Fahrenheit, and the humidity dropped sharply, from 80 degrees to 69 degrees. Yesterday, from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the highest temperature was 62 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest was 55 degrees.</p>
<h3>British Cotton Textiles Exports to Hong Kong Increase</h3>
<p>The British Cotton Industry Federation reported that exports of cotton yarn and cotton textiles to Hong Kong and China increased sharply last year, increasing by 8% compared to 1937. However, the situation in other domestic and foreign sales venues was bleak. Except for the European war period, this was the first time in 90 years. The sales of cotton yarn decreased by 22%, and cotton textiles decreased by 25%.</p>
<h3>British China Relief Donation Committee; Executive Committee Discusses Relief Methods; Actively Soliciting Items from All Walks of Life; Hoping to Distribute Advance Tickets</h3>
<p>The British China Relief Donation Committee held a general meeting of new executives at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss all matters related to relief. More than 70 people attended, including Huang Maolin, Hu Suzhen, Lu Lingyun, and Lin Zifeng. Chairman Lei Yinwan announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that the significance of inviting all walks of life to attend today is to discuss the collection of items and fundraising. In order to raise funds for relief, this donation has been scheduled for the 26th, 27th, and 28th of this month for a three-day sale and carnival. We hope that all walks of life will contribute enthusiastically. In the future, if anyone donates to this association, they can send it directly to HSBC Bank to collect the receipt. Then Lu Lingyun gave a speech, saying that the association has been busy with the work of the sale, and the association has pre-sale tickets prepared. Please distribute them automatically everywhere. The most important things for the association now are (1) collecting items, (2) promoting pre-sale tickets. We hope everyone will work hard to promote them.</p>
<h3>National Products Export Collection Point Moved from Hong Kong to Kunming; Concentrated in Kunming and Transferred to Vietnam and Myanmar; Export Value of 70 Million Yuan Last Year</h3>
<p>Since adjusting its foreign trade, the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance of my country has been making every effort to encourage local goods to increase production, expand foreign sales markets, and unite with the China Vegetable Oil Company, the Central Credit Bureau, the China Tea Company, etc. to purchase important local goods for export nationwide. They are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. Among them, goods such as silk, tea, tung oil, pigs, wood, and ore are the largest. Those who have settled foreign exchange are allowed to be tax-free. Since the implementation, it has been quite effective. The entire trade has improved, and the import surplus has gradually decreased. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has increased the fund for the Trade Commission. The total is 80 million. In the past, local goods exports were concentrated in Hong Kong. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell, the association has decided to change to concentrate in Kunming. Because Kunming is the only transportation hub in the southwest, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs directly from Kunming to Hanoi, and the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway also runs from Kunming to Myanmar. In the future, all kinds of local goods exports will not need to be concentrated in Hong Kong. Last year, the value of local goods exports was 76,264,158 yuan, the year before was 83,815,575 yuan, and in 1936 was 70,574,143 yuan. Last year increased compared to 1936, and decreased compared to 1937, but the export volume of major local goods did not decrease.</p>
<h3>Rampant Bandits on Land and Water: Twenty-Six Robberies Occurred Last Month; One Hundred and Twenty-Four Bandits Armed with Fifty-Six Guns Plundered Valuables and Jewelry Worth Over Six Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>As the year draws to a close, bandits seize the opportunity to commit theft and armed robbery relentlessly. According to police statistics, a total of twenty-six armed robberies occurred last month in various land and water areas of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. A total of one hundred and twenty-four bandits were involved in the cases, carrying a total of fifty-six firearms, including long and short guns, as well as other weapons such as sharp swords and knives. The stolen cash and jewelry amounted to over six thousand dollars. One of the most serious losses occurred in Sheung Shui Village, where HKD 810 and national currency 1,600 were robbed. The second largest loss was HKD 973 in Shek Kip Mei Village. Among the twenty-six robberies, the largest number of bandits involved in a robbery was eighteen, armed with twelve guns, intercepting Chen Deqing's cargo boat in Nim Wan. Of the hundred-plus bandits, the police only arrested two afterward, and most remained at large. A table listing the robberies that occurred last month is as follows:</p>

<h3>Cantonese Drama Group: The Times Drama Troupe's Seventh Performance, Starting Today for Four Consecutive Days at the Popular Theater</h3>
<p>Special report from this newspaper: The "Times Drama Troupe" should not be unfamiliar to those who love drama and care about cultural work. It is a dramatic flower that bloomed in Hong Kong after the prelude to the July 7th Anti-Japanese War. Its core members are generally more alert young people and backbones of the theater community. Its achievements over the past year have left an indelible mark in the Hong Kong theater field.</p>
<p>In their continuous pursuit of progress, they have also been influenced and encouraged by external professional theater troupes – such as China Travel and China Arts – and thus, they are showing a more lively and progressive attitude.</p>
<p>Their first series of work – regular performances – came to an end with the fifth performance. Coincidentally, the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian came south and agreed to direct the troupe. After this landmark event, the promotion of the Hong Kong spoken drama movement became even more active.</p>
<p>Since December of last year, they have been busy rehearsing under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang. The sixth performance was in Macau. Now, they have decided to perform at the Popular Theater in Kowloon for four consecutive days starting today, as the second phase of their seventh major performance.</p>
<p>The repertoire includes the famous trilogy by Cao Yu, the nation's premier playwright, and the national defense satirical comedy "The New Official Takes Office," a recent work by the famous playwright Chen Baichen. Today's performance is "Wilderness"; the second day's daytime performance is "Wilderness I", and the evening performance is "Sunrise"; the third day and night is "The New Official Takes Office". The fourth night is "Thunderstorm". These scripts are all outstanding works, coupled with their well-practiced skills and the leadership of Mr. Ouyang, success is to be expected.</p>
<p>"Mandarin dramas are not easy to penetrate the general audience in Hong Kong"; if this is the shortcoming of "China Travel" and "China Arts," then the Times Troupe may be able to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>It – the Times Drama Troupe – performs in Cantonese, not to passively "please" the audience, but to "adapt" to the environment to improve the audience's level of understanding. The troupe members encourage each other with this, and we also place our earnest hopes on them, wishing them success in completing this difficult task on the cultural desert island.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Merchants in Hong Kong and Macau Store Salt Tax Donations: Ordered to be Used for Refugee Relief; Tax of Sixty Cents Per Load; Total Expected to Reach One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch) Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of refugees in Hong Kong and Macau has increased daily. Chinese civil organizations in Hong Kong have competed to provide relief. The Chinese authorities are also sparing no effort in this relief work. It is reported that Cantonese salt merchants in Hong Kong and Macau recently received a notice from Section Chief He Shili of the Guangdong Provincial Salt Bureau's Hong Kong Office, stating that all salt stored in Hong Kong and Macau after the fall of Guangzhou may be transported for sale to the three counties of Zhongshan, Panyu, and Xinhui after paying a salt tax of sixty cents per load in national currency. The tax revenue will be entirely allocated to the Red Cross for refugee relief. It is said that the salt merchants believe that paying taxes to relieve refugees is a righteous act and are very enthusiastic. Therefore, after receiving the notice, they have been paying the required amount one after another. It is estimated that the total amount of salt stored in Hong Kong and Macau after the fall of Guangzhou is no less than 120,000 packages. Calculated at sixty cents per load, the total amount paid by the salt merchants will reach 150,000 yuan. The Red Cross will receive this large sum of money, which will save countless lives, truly a boon for the refugees.</p>
<h3>China's Cotton Exports: Valued at 100 Million Yuan in National Currency Last Year; Japan Purchased 90% to Manufacture Military Supplies; Exports to Hong Kong Valued at Over 380,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to customs reports, China's cotton exports last year totaled 1,356,620 metric tons, valued at over 100 million yuan in national currency. Among them, exports to Japan were the largest, accounting for 90% of the total, totaling 963,837 metric tons, valued at 71,709,723 yuan. Exports to Hong Kong were 5,009 metric tons, valued at 389,220 yuan. Previously, China's cotton exports were concentrated in Tianjin and Shanghai. Since the fall of these two places, Japan has purchased large quantities from these two places and transported them back for use as industrial and military raw materials, resulting in a sharp increase in national cotton exports last year, occupying the first place among national exports.</p>
<h3>× Purchasing Food in Hong Kong: Imported Rice from Hong Kong Continues to be Transported North; Over 10,000 Bags of Imported Rice Exported in Ten Days</h3>
<p>Recently, over 50,000 bags of imported rice stored in Hong Kong have been transported north to Tianjin, Shandong, and other places in batches. According to recent news from rice merchants in Hong Kong, since the large-scale northward transport of rice some time ago, general purchasers have continued to make acquisitions without stopping. Recently, there have been many shipments from Siam and other places. The Hong Kong rice market is expected to decline slightly, but because some people are actively collecting, most of the incoming rice, in addition to supplying the Hong Kong market, is transferred for export. Although the destination is not known in detail, due to the fact that water and land transportation in South China are blocked, the only route is to North China, where Japanese × people are entrenched. It is estimated that over 10,000 bags of imported rice have been exported within ten days. The Hong Kong rice market has not been able to decline in price due to this influence.</p>

<h3>The Hasty Scene of the "Year" End</h3>
<p>"Year End" is "Difficult End." Poor people are most afraid of encountering the New Year. However, you may be afraid, but that ruthless "Difficult End" will not let you go. It still relentlessly presses toward you, because that fleeting time has passed second by second. In the blink of an eye, it is already the end of the year!</p>
<p>The not-so-new "New Year" is coming soon. Every year at this time, people are very busy preparing for the "New Year." The wealthy are certainly busy sewing new clothes, buying new shoes, buying new hats, and preparing New Year goods. The whole family, big and small, are extremely busy. However, the lifelong poor are frowning all day long, wondering how to "avoid debt" or "borrow money" in order to break through this "money barrier" that is even more difficult than the "beauty trap"?</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is quite lively. The Hong Kong government also seems to accommodate the habits of the residents and specially allows many things that are usually prohibited. For example, residents are allowed to freely set off firecrackers during the New Year period (note that setting off firecrackers should not harm pedestrians or endanger public safety, otherwise it will still be subject to legal sanctions), and a designated location is allocated and leased to New Year goods merchants at low prices so that they can freely sell New Year goods. Because there are Chinese people serving in government agencies, and the Chinese have the custom of holding group worship ceremonies on New Year's Day, special holidays are also granted to avoid spoiling their fun!</p>
<p>Su Hang Street in Central and the area along the Wan Chai waterfront, from Hennessey Road to Gloucester Road to the east, and across the sea, are great places to sell New Year goods every year. As usual, vendors are allowed to set up stalls from the 21st day of the twelfth month. The government also recruits merchants in advance to set up stalls for vendors to rent and use. Although there are no sheds on Su Hang Street, New Year goods merchants will use empty shops that no one rents as their temporary stores. However, the situation this year seems to be somewhat different, because there are not many empty shops this year, and permanent stores have become a problem, let alone temporary ones? If someone rents, of course, it is impossible, and even if no one rents, it has become a problem because the owners take the opportunity to raise the rental value. During this short business period, high rental values are something that small businesses cannot afford. Therefore, the New Year goods market on Su Hang Street this year will probably not be as lively as in previous years. However, the situation in Wan Chai is a bit different. According to the hopes expressed by general New Year goods merchants, the business situation this year may be better than in previous years. The reason is that Hong Kong has tens of thousands more "refugees," who are all "high-level refugees" who have fled to Hong Kong with large sums of money to avoid "disaster," and they are very generous with their lives when it comes to eating, drinking, and having fun. The vendors have this new group of customers, so how can they not be overjoyed and express great hope? It seems that grabbing a handful of money to spend a "prosperous New Year" is not a problem at all.</p>
<p>The sales of New Year goods are already more promising than last year, but the situation regarding the flower market has caused concern among the "flower protectors." Because most of the fresh flowers sold in the New Year flower market are transported from various parts of the country. This year, however, because the homeland is full of flames, Shandong's peonies, Lingnan's plum blossoms, and other famous local products such as hanging bells and daffodils have all been熏染 by the ruthless artillery fire of the × people, which has damaged their delicate floral faces? At the same time, because domestic transportation in the homeland is also being extremely disturbed and blocked by the × people, general flower vendors are afraid of suffering losses and dare not transport flowers as vigorously as in previous years. Therefore, the types of New Year flowers will certainly be greatly reduced compared to previous years, which is undoubtedly true. Although they dare to transport them boldly, they are not worried about not having sales, but they are probably not brave enough because it involves their livelihood. In this case, the flower market this year will inevitably have a feeling of "waning flowers"!</p>

<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>Memories of Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>The first time I stepped into Stone City was in the summer of the 16th year of the Republic of China. Before I went to Nanjing, people told me that Nanjing City was so big, terribly big, several dozen miles around, more than ten miles in diameter. It would take at least two or three hours by rickshaw. Later, when I experienced it myself, it really lived up to its name. The city is divided into inner and outer cities. The outer city is 180 miles around, with 18 gates, but the bases have long been abandoned, and only the names remain. The inner city is about 90 miles around. In those years, there were twelve city gates: Fengrun, Taiping, and Chaoyang in the east; Hongwu, Tongji, and Jinbao in the south; Shuixi and Hanxi in the west; and Shence, Yihui, and Jinchuan in the north, as well as the new Jinchuan Gate opened for the Jiangning train.</p>
<p>Walking out of Xiaguan Station, I took a horse-drawn carriage into that dilapidated turret and the pitch-black Feng Gate. The horse's hooves clip-clopped, and the wheels rattled, traveling on the jagged, uneven gravel road. We had already entered the city, but it was still like driving in the suburbs. From Gulou to Jiming Temple, the road was slightly flatter, and there were fields on both sides. Looking into the distance, I could often see farmers carrying plows, young women carrying baskets, and children herding cattle, coming and going between the fields. I never thought that in this city known as "Powder Capital of the South" and "Royal Atmosphere of Jinling," I could still see such a pastoral scene.</p>
<p>Gulou is the only towering building in the city. Next to the building are open acres piled with artificial mountains, planted with flowers and trees, and covered with grass bricks. The green lawn is like felt, which is quite interesting. To the northwest of the building, there is a pavilion for tourists to rest. The base of the building is a high platform, several feet high, with three arched doors below. The middle door is the largest, and the left and right are slightly smaller. There is a Changguan Pavilion on the platform, with two rear rooms. Climbing the pavilion and looking into the distance, the landscape is like mourning, which can make people open their minds and forget the hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>Turning south from Gulou to Chengbao Street, the houses along the way are lined up one after another, with three or four exquisite small Western-style buildings from time to time. The vermilion tiles and pink walls, with the blue sky, white sun, and red flags flying in the wind among the green trees, complement each other and present a solemn atmosphere in the beautiful scenery. That is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army is located in the West Garden of the former Governor's Office Street. The garden is shaded by trees and has an acre of blue water, surrounded by a tile and brick railing. Duckweed floats on the surface of the water, as dense as a green lawn. There is a stone boat in the middle, inscribed with the words "Do Not Strike the Boat." The boat is slightly smaller than the stone boat in the Summer Palace in Beijing, and the architectural scale is also narrower, but it seems much better than the one in Guyi Garden in Nanxiang. There are also pavilions and pavilions next to the pond, a cluster of clear bamboo, and several stacks of rocks. The cicadas chirp, the birds sing, the flowers are fragrant, and the wind is warm. It is truly a paradise.</p>
<p>In the past, Xihuaguo was a place for personal enjoyment by warlords. At that time, it had been changed to the office of the General Headquarters. Going hundreds of steps forward from the pond, meandering through several winding corridors, there is a vermilion-walled high hall, which is the Central Military and Political Committee. In the past, it was the golden house where the Jiangsu warlords hid their mistresses. There is a square in front of the house, with continuous fragrant grass and lush green shade, still retaining the fragrance of rouge and powder. There is another courtyard behind the house, with a small brick path in the middle, planted with hundreds of dwarf junipers on both sides. Walking leisurely in it, reflecting the clothes into green. At the end of the path, a high hall can be seen, with steps in front. This is the editorial department of the National Revolutionary Army Daily.</p>
<p>The only place to cool off and relax in Nanjing is Xiushan Park, which is located in the southeast of Fucheng Bridge inside Tongji Gate. The park covers an area of more than 40 acres. On the left side of the park, you can see the willows swaying over the Qinhuai River by Fucheng Bridge. On the right side, you can see the clouds on Zijin Mountain from afar. The park originally had the Yingwei Pavilion, which housed the statue of former Jiangsu Governor Li Chun. To the south of the pavilion, there is the Yingwei General Memorial Stele, the Xiushan General Bronze Statue. In the southeast of the park, there is the Xiushan Yibi Pavilion, the History Museum, the Popular Library, etc. When I first visited Xiushan Park in the 16th year of the Republic of China, someone had just proposed to change the park, remove the statue, confiscate the reverse property, and eliminate all the stains in the park. The outside of the Xiushan bronze statue was covered with rice straw, and I could not see its true face. Before long, Xiushan Park was indeed renamed Xuehua Park, and finally it was renamed the First Park.</p>
<p>The most lingering place in the park is "Xiaoyao You," which is the center of the entire park. Most of the tourists are scattered nearby, sitting and sipping tea. There is dense green shade, soft grass, comfortable rattan chairs, and white-clad waiters. The cool evening breeze, mixed with the fragrance of lotuses in the lotus pond, blows in bursts, which can make people's hearts feel intoxicated and comfortable.</p>
<p>Nanjing has many scenic spots and historical sites that make people linger and reluctant to leave, especially the solemn and simple Xiaoling Mausoleum. Facing the deep tomb passage, people can't help but feel a sense of reverence. In addition, there are the lofty Jiming Temple, the elegant Xuanwu Lake, the tranquil Qingliang Temple, and the precipitous Yanziji, etc. This Stone City on Lion Hill once had the great name of "Hero of the Heavenly Palace," but it has suffered many wars and disasters. In the mud of the vicissitudes of life, there are still traces of ancient historical buildings.</p>
<p>Although I am not an archaeologist with a historical obsession, in the ten years after the construction of the new capital, facing the newly emerging Nanjing, I could not help but recall many indelible impressions. Every time I went to Nanjing, every time I saw new buildings, filling this ancient site of the Six Dynasties year after year, the old scenes that I had seen during my first visit became more deeply imprinted in my heart.</p>
<p>Since the ruthless artillery fire of the Lugouqiao incident shocked the dream of the people of the whole country, Shanghai and Nanjing have successively fallen. Before the National Government moved its capital, I ventured to Nanjing amidst the hail of bullets. In the large and small roads and alleys, I found earthbags and basements. The buildings of the various ministries and the traffic on the roads were all covered with gray and black dirt. The entire city seemed to have been blackened by smoke and coal. In the park, there were many wreckage of Japanese aircraft picked up in Nanjing. All public entertainment venues were closed. The Qinhuai River and Xuanwu Lake were also damaged by bombs and turned into a desolate dead water pool. I regretted that during that hurried trip, I did not go to Zhongshan Gate to pay tribute to the tombs of the two national heroes on Zijin Mountain. The heroic souls of Zhu Taizu and Sun Yat-sen are still there. Even now, they are still gazing in the dark at this old capital of Hongwu and the capital of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Journey to Northern Fujian (2)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Wang Qixi</p>
<p>Six Bends – Tianyou Rock, Peach Blossom Spring Cave, Golden Rooster Cave.</p>
<p>Seven Bends – Chengyun Peak, Qiyun Peak.</p>
<p>Eight Bends – Jinshi Peak, Lingfeng Peak, Three-Layer Peak, Drum Cliff.</p>
<p>Nine Bends – Cuiyun Peak, Rising Peak, Fishing Peak, Fishing Terrace, Little Nine Bends.</p>
<p>On this day, we first arrived at the First Bend. After passing Zhizhi Nunnery, we arrived at Wuyi Palace, which is the largest Taoist temple in the entire mountain, with many inscriptions. A martyrs' cemetery is currently being built here. We then ascended to Jade Girl Peak, with a pavilion standing in the heart of the stream. At that time, there was a light drizzle, the sound of the stream was clear, and the water flowed in bends. I don't know how many bends there were. Then we went up along the stream, forgetting the distance, and crossed the raft to the other side. We went down the stream and arrived at the public hall at 1:00 PM. We learned that the bus to Jianyang had broken down near Chishi, and a repair shop had been dispatched to repair it.</p>
<p>The public hall is remote and there are no restaurants. Therefore, the bus station manager hosted a meal, which was very kind. We arrived in Jianyang at 5:00 PM. The trip to Wuyi was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Day 8 Jianyang to Nanping</p>
<p>In the morning, we packed our luggage and prepared to return south. Mr. Li and others insisted on visiting for a few more days. Mr. Zhao decided to leave today because his vacation was over. We took the public bus. From here to Nanping, it is 118 kilometers, passing through Jianou, a place we have already been to. And the 68 kilometers to Ouping is our new journey this time. The scenery along the way is very beautiful. As we approached Nanping, the highway was built along the mountain, overlooking the long stream like a belt, with many wood rafts piled up beside the stream.</p>
<p>We arrived in Nanping at around 4:00 PM and stayed at the Nanping Reception Center of the Fujian Travel Agency, which is affiliated with the Fujian Construction Department. The facilities are very good and can be called a model hotel. After resting, we went to the city to visit.</p>
<p>The stream in Nanping is called Jianjin. There is Jianjin Middle School here. I jokingly said to Mr. Zhao, "This school must have the style of both Oxford and Cambridge Universities." Then we laughed together. Nanping was originally called Yanping County during the Jin Dynasty. In the past, Zhang Hua ordered Lei Huan to go to Fengcheng to dig a prison house. He entered the ground and obtained a stone with nine inscriptions. There were two swords in the stone, named "Longquan" and "Tai'a." He gave one to Hua and kept the other for himself. Later, Hua was executed and the whereabouts of the sword were lost. After Huan died, his son took the sword and passed through Yanping Jin. The sword suddenly jumped into the water, and only saw two dragons, each several feet long. This is where the name Jianjin comes from. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Western Hunan</h3>
<p>— Farmer</p>
<p>Water and land transportation has become more convenient; the patriotic sentiments of the Miao people are fervent.</p>
<p>[General Notes on Qiancheng] "Outside the Peach Blossom Spring, drifting lightly on a small boat, with residual waters and mountains aimlessly explored, cliffs and peaks lining the banks like Qin Dynasty caves, the entire river bathed in wind and moonlight, like the autumn sky of Chu. Far from my old country, a thousand miles away, I despondently pour a cup of wine in this new pavilion. After getting drunk, I don't mind being as wild as before, reciting verses and gazing at the Wu hook several times." This is a verse composed by this reporter while boating on an autumn night at Peach Blossom Spring. Since leaving Xu last year, I, the reporter, have drifted like a tumbleweed to the west. Grieving the loss of my country and home, and being wanted by a certain faction, my fields and dwellings have been seized, and my family scattered to the ends of the earth. Disappointed in the world, I boldly put down my pen. As far as my whip reached, I dusted off the traces of my journey in western Hunan. It might also be something that those concerned about the southwest would be happy to see.</p>
<p>Western Hunan Transportation - Perilous Mountains and Rivers</p>
<p>The mountains of western Hunan stretch endlessly, with ridges and peaks rising and falling. The Yuan River is long and winding, flowing between them. Western Hunan's transportation relies on this one line. The recently opened Western Hunan Highway also runs parallel to the Yuan River, with the greatest distance between them being less than a hundred *li*. It mostly cuts through mountains to make roads, winding and turning. The driving is laborious. Therefore, the transportation of goods still relies on boats on the Yuan River. This time, my long journey started from Changde, going up the Yuan River. After forty days, I arrived at Lushan. I passed five large rapids and hundreds of small ones, but the distance covered was still less than five hundred *li*. It shows how difficult it is to travel in this area. Going upstream from Luxi, the waterway follows the Yuan River into Guizhou, while the highway branches off at Sanjiaoping. From there, the Western Hunan Highway goes along the Yuan River through Chenxi, Zhijiang, and Xiangtan to Zhenyuan in Guizhou. The Sichuan-Hunan Highway goes northwest from Luxi via Fenghuang and Yongshui to Xiushan in Sichuan Province. In general, the Western Hunan Highway goes southwest, while the Sichuan-Hunan Highway goes northwest. This is a general overview of the transportation in western Hunan.</p>
<p>The Peach Blossom Spring of the Past - Now Filled with Common Hatred</p>
<p>When I set sail from Changde, it was already late autumn. The river was calm and the water stable, making it easy for large and small sailboats to navigate. However, steamships can only travel to below Taoyuan, where they must run aground. Only the section of the Yuan River between Changde and Taoyuan can accommodate steamships in all seasons. Above Taoyuan, navigation is unobstructed in spring and summer. In autumn and winter, the water is shallow and the rapids are exposed. Even sailboats cannot pass without extra towing. During the summer flood season, only steamships can travel, and sailboats disappear again. The most severe flooding occurs around the fifth month of the lunar calendar. Locals predict the water level by observing whether there is spring snow that year. Flooding will occur if spring snow melts rapidly. If there is no spring snow that year, the water will remain stable throughout the year. Experts believe that spring snow melts easily and is difficult to accumulate for long. It flows down from the high mountains, and streams converge to form a powerful current that takes a hundred days to subside. This has been proven true repeatedly. However, winter snow does not have this predictive value. When my boat passed Taoyuan, there was an air raid alarm. Although I disembarked and inspected the county seat, most of the shops were closed. The streets were narrow but clean. Our troops were stationed there, and the defenses were well-established. The Social Education Corps was also adjusting its work among the people. According to Mr. Bie of the Education Team, although Taoyuan is known as a secluded place, it is close to Changde and has convenient transportation, far surpassing the upper reaches. The morale of the people is highly developed. The county seat is on the north bank of the Yuan River, and the Western Hunan Highway runs west along the south bank. The Qin Dynasty caves that have always been praised are also in the mountains on the south bank, about thirty *li* from the city. Because the boat trip was long, I was unable to visit. It was once known as a place to escape the world, but now it is filled with common hatred, which is enough to make people happy. The Qin Dynasty is not worth escaping from anymore.</p>
<p>Many Rapids on the Yuan River - Cliffs on Both Banks</p>
<p>After passing Taoyuan, the boat gradually entered the rapids. The section of the upper Yuan River between Yuanling and Taoyuan, a distance of three hundred *li*, has the most rapids. The large rapids are all within Yuanling. Going upstream along the river, the first is Wengzidong, then Qinglangtan, then Niangniangtan, then Hengshitan, and then Jiuxitan. Among the five large rapids, Qinglang is the most dangerous, five *li* long. On the shore is the Shrine of the Marquis of Xinxi, also known as the Fubo Palace, which houses a statue of General Ma Yuan of the Han Dynasty, the Fubo General. The incense is very strong. Merchants sailing to and from this place must drop anchor here and offer a prayer. The local people offer sacrifices even more devoutly, commonly calling it the Lord's Temple. The upper reaches of the Yuan River were the ancient land of the Five Creek Barbarians. Fubo pacified the barbarians, going upstream along the river. Qinglangtan was where his troops were stationed. The rapids have many whetstones, and the water is constricted by the stones, making the channel narrow and the flow rapid. When boats pass through here, they must temporarily add trackers. Ropes are carried ashore, and trackers pull the boats upstream. The narrowest part of the channel can only accommodate one boat. When I arrived here, the masts of the boats were like a forest, waiting to pass through the rapids in order between the rapids exit and Dongting Creek, a distance of five *li*. Because my boat was light and small, I was able to pass through easily without delay. I heard that some boats had been waiting for half a month and still had not set sail. The dredging of the rapids is urgently needed. The waterway in the lower reaches of Wengzidong is also narrow, but because the rapids are short, it is easier to pass through. The rapids upstream, such as Luoniang, Fushi, and Jiuxi, have rapid water and wide channels, so there is no need to stop. However, all the rapids have cliffs on both banks, making the waterways narrow and steep. The banks of Wengzidong are particularly steep, with iron chains fastened to the rocks for climbing. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the prefect of Chenzhou repaired the existing three hundred plus *zhang*, but it is now dilapidated and incomplete. Trackers carry ropes ashore, grasp the chains to prevent capsizing, and crawl along the path. This is their profession. Each tow earns them three or four *jiao*, and the helmsman earns twice as much. The old rule for towing in the rapids was one bowl of rice per tow. The Hengshitan waterway is wide, so water towing is required. The trackers carry ropes and wade through the water, which can be deep enough to reach their thighs. This is often the case even in the cold winter. They are truly accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Dense Population Around Yuanling</p>
<p>Yuanling was the seat of the Chenzhou Prefecture during the Qing Dynasty. The city is on the north bank, built against the mountain, with a majestic appearance. Now the Hunan provincial government has moved here. The south bank is the bus station, with a dense population. It is the most important town in western Hunan. Society and culture are highly developed. There used to be two newspapers, "Yuantao" and "Chenzhong". Recently, "Zhongbao" and "Guomin Daily", which was moved from Changsha, have been added. The circulation is wide. All the news of western Hunan is channeled through here. According to Mr. Cai of the Social Education Corps, the local people are very enlightened, and the education is very smooth. National consciousness is very strong. Donations are enthusiastically made to relieve the national crisis. Above this, to Luxi, there are mixed Miao people who are known to be difficult to govern, because of their strong customs. However, they are rich in traditional ideas. Mr. Chen Quzhen, the author of "Travels in Western Hunan", is highly respected by the Miao people. Now, Chen has moved the Western Hunan Pacification Office to Qiancheng, which makes it even more convenient to govern the Miao people. The once mysterious region of western Hunan, in the eyes of the people of the country, is being thoroughly developed. As for the waterway, after passing Yuanling, it becomes more calm again. The boat travels for one day to Shanghai. Luxi is a tributary of the Yuan River. The county seat is prosperous. Boats coming from upstream all moor here. Because of my mission, I changed to a car to go to Qiancheng. It took three hours to arrive. The car travels on mountain slopes, overlooking the creek. This is the Sichuan-Hunan Highway. Compared to the Western Hunan Highway from Sanjiaoping, it is still flat. Only small boats can be rowed on the waterway. The Sichuan-Hunan transportation relies on this highway.</p>
<p>Living Conditions of the Miao People in Western Hunan</p>
<p>Qiancheng was the seat of Qianzhou Prefecture during the late Qing Dynasty. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the city is built of stone, small and solid. The highway is fifteen *li* east of the city, with a branch connecting to the county seat. Miao people from all directions gather and live together. Within about ten *li*, they are all acculturated Miao. Beyond thirty *li*, one sees the raw Miao. The acculturated Miao people, both men and women, wrap their heads in blue cloth and wear straw sandals. The clothing of the men is no different from that of the Han people. The women still wear Qing Dynasty-style clothing, and they like to wear silver ornaments, with chains and locks hanging down their chests. They can speak Mandarin when they go to the market to buy things. The raw Miao people live in the mountains and rarely go to the market. Both acculturated and raw Miao people like to eat duck blood. Bowls of blood are displayed in the shops, and the Miao people drink them freely. Both men and women are strong and can climb mountains like flying. They use copper coins from Sichuan Province. Recently, the Pacification Office announced that legal tender will be used uniformly. The local community fully supports the legal tender policy, and the credit is obvious. Legal tender is now circulating among the Miao people. The Miao people's anti-Japanese sentiment is also very high, thanks to Mr. Chen's orders. The primary and secondary school teacher service group is working effectively in the social education work in Qiancheng. This year, during the New Year, Zhang Zhizhong inspected western Hunan and was warmly welcomed by all sectors in Qiancheng. In the evening, the local people held a torchlight parade, fully expressing the patriotic spirit of the people. This is truly gratifying to the people of the country. After this, I will go deeper into the Miao region and have more to tell readers.</p>

<h3>A Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>Because in this way, the vicious Japanese will use valuation methods to take over your silkworm rearing rooms, silkworm rearing tools, mulberry gardens, etc., as fixed assets. Wouldn't that fall right into their trap? Therefore, for the current plan, silkworm rearing farms and manufacturing centers in the war zone should actively adopt two routes: moving to the guerrilla zone and the rear. The former is to move as much as possible and as quickly as possible everything that can be moved to the area controlled by the guerrillas, in order to prepare for starting the silkworm rearing business in the guerrilla zone. At the same time, everything that cannot be moved, such as the buildings near the silkworm rearing rooms, should be completely or partially destroyed in order to cut off the Japanese's covetous desires. We know that in the war zone, the Japanese only maintain a few transportation lines with difficulty, as well as the larger cities. Other vast rural areas are under the control of the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, as long as the silkworm rearing farms are willing to give up the current equipment, there is no problem in moving to the guerrilla zone to operate. Moreover, the silkworm eggs from several silkworm rearing farms that are deeply trusted by the farmers, such as the Tiger Brand silkworm eggs from the Huxuguan Dayou Silkworm Rearing Farm, the Longevity Star Brand silkworm eggs from the Huguan Silkworm Rearing Farm, the Triangle Brand silkworm eggs from the Renxu Hall, and the Three Gourd Brand silkworm eggs from the Taixi Sanwu Hall, can still maintain their inherent position among the farmers in the war zone and will not be destroyed. Then, after driving away the Japanese in the future, it will be an excellent foundation for expansion. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrives in the Philippines First and then Hong Kong, Squad Set to Depart on March 13</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The Chinese football scene in Singapore has made considerable progress in recent years. The Chinese football team, which is most popular among fans there, swept everything this season and won the league title.</p>
<p>The team is not satisfied with winning the championship and has decided to travel to the Philippines for matches in the near future to improve the players' skills. They will also come to Hong Kong afterwards. This has been reported before.</p>
<p>A month ago, the team's vice-captain, Xu Houkun, came to Hong Kong to discuss the trip with the South China Athletic Association. The team's initial plan was to come to Hong Kong first and then move to the Philippines, but the Philippine side did not approve of this, fearing that if the team played in Hong Kong first, any injuries to the players would affect the box office appeal in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The team respected the host's wishes and decided to go to the Philippines first, arriving in Hong Kong at the end of March. They will play two matches in Hong Kong. South China has reported this to the General Association and received its approval. The final of the Li Hua Cup will be moved forward to March 26, and the dates of April 1 and 2 will be used for the team's matches against South China and the Hong Kong Combined Team.</p>
<p>I received a letter from the team's vice-captain, Xu, yesterday, saying that the team's squad for this trip is quite balanced. However, it is a pity that Zheng Liliang, a former South China player who is now playing on the left wing in Singapore and often puts on outstanding performances, will not be able to join the team due to business reasons. However, his replacement, Yan Jixiang, is also a good left winger. They also plan to invite Huang Jinbo, a goalkeeper from Kuala Lumpur, and Guan Shunde, a talented forward, to join the team to increase their fighting power. All the team members are now applying for leave and should be able to travel in full force. The departure date has been set for March 13, when they will take the Italian mail ship Victoria to the Philippines, and they will arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines on March 26. The full team roster is as follows (Soccer Overlord):</p>
<p>Singapore Chinese Team</p>

<p>Ye Maofa Wen Shunshan Deng Yuehan (Captain)</p>

<h3>Interport Team Tests Their Skills, Drawing with Hong Kong Combined Team</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Yesterday at 5:00 PM, the Hong Kong Interport Representative Team played a practice match against the Hong Kong Combined Team at the Navy Ground. The Interport Team fielded their original lineup, while the Hong Kong Combined Team was missing Wu Liezhi, Liao Yachen, Zuo Zhi from Kowloon Football Club and Bi Ledu from St. Joseph's College. The lineup was slightly changed.</p>
<p>The reason why Wu Liezhi, Liao Yachen, and Zuo Zhi were absent was not because they were busy, but because they did not want to exert themselves and were preparing to play against South China tomorrow to fight for the semi-final spot in the Beryl Cup.</p>
<p>Tickets were two jiao each, a reasonable price, so the spectators were very crowded, with a total of over five thousand people.</p>
<p>Because it was a practice match, the Interport Team players did not put on a very energetic performance, which was expected. To prepare for the big battle to come, they naturally did not want to compete too intensely in this practice match or cause any injuries to their bodies, which would affect the important event.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Interport Team had many flaws in yesterday's match that need to be addressed and improved.</p>
<p>(1) The three midfielders, as I expected, all liked to dribble and attack, so the Hong Kong Combined Team's forwards were able to find winning opportunities and had more overall shots than the Interport Team. This was because the three midfielders of the Interport Team liked to attack, often leaving the defense empty. The Hong Kong Combined Team's forwards were able to take advantage of this and launch surprise attacks. This type of attack does not seem like a good strategy for dealing with the Philippine team, because the Philippine team players are all strong and agile. Surprise attacks are their specialty. I think the three midfielders of the Hong Kong team should improve this attack strategy.</p>
<p>(2) The five forwards were not coordinated. Li Huitang was originally a master of center attacks, but Shi Dagao seemed unable to cooperate with him, passing more often to the left wing than passing to the center. Therefore, the only one who could fully support Li Huitang was Feng Jingxiang, but Fula was not coordinated with Jingxiang, and his crosses were not accurate. Hou Chengtou was energetic enough, but his dribbling was not yet adequate. Chengtou should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(3) As for the inside backs, Li Tiansheng was beyond reproach, but Shi Han's position often failed to cover Liang Rongzhao, so their cooperation in mutually caring for each other was lacking in understanding.</p>
<p>I believe that the Hong Kong team representatives should start practicing every morning from now on and try to improve the team's offensive and defensive cooperation. Then it will be easier to achieve success in the big battle to come.</p>
<p>On the Hong Kong Combined Team, Hou Rongsheng, Deng Guangsen, and MacAllister performed the best. Chen Dehui was also a likable player. If the Hong Kong Combined Team had fielded their original lineup, the Interport Team would have been threatened. In the first half, the two teams tied 0-0. In the second half, seven minutes after the start, Huitang's long shot hit the crossbar and bounced to the ground. Chengtou rushed forward and headed the ball in, opening the scoring. A moment later, Dehui received a pass from Deqi and scored in front of the goal, making it 1-1. The score remained the same until the end of the game. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Shanghai Charity Basketball Final; Mixed Team Wins Championship; Chen Bangzhen's Two Long-Range Shots Bring Resurrection; 30-34 Macleans Lose</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, 5th Dispatch] The China Youth Basketball Arena was filled with cheers last night, and the atmosphere was frenzied. Enthusiastic ladies packed the venue. In the final match of the East-West Charity Basketball Tournament organized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Mixed Team, in the last two minutes when all hope seemed lost, trailing Macleans 28-30, Chen Bangzhen, as a new force, jumped onto the court and made two long-range shots from the half-court line, one directly in the center and one on the right side. Miraculously, both shots went in, resurrecting the Mixed Team and putting them ahead of Macleans with a score of 32-30. Just before the end, Da Yun scored again, resulting in the Mixed Team defeating Macleans 34-30 and winning the championship. The overall record was two wins to one. In the first game, the Mixed Team defeated Macleans 28-20. In the second game, Macleans defeated the Mixed Team 28-25. In the third game, the Mixed Team defeated Macleans 34-30.</p>
<p>Mixed Team Escapes Dangerously</p>
<p>The Mixed Team's overall performance last night was extremely poor, almost entirely controlled by Macleans. Initially, they trailed 7-4, then rallied, taking the lead by one point only twice, at 10-9 and 11-. However, the first half ended with Macleans leading by one point at 12-11. In the second half, Macleans came on strong, scoring three consecutive goals to make it 18-11. From then on, they led the way, with the Mixed Team trailing, falling behind 27-19, a significant deficit of eight points. Everyone was sweating for the Mixed Team. Chen Xianglong was ejected in the first half, and then Li Zhenzhong was also ejected. However, the Mixed Team ultimately turned defeat into victory in desperation, which was truly fortunate and incredibly close. Macleans performed impressively last night. In the first half, they used a five-man zone defense, focusing more on attack than defense. The Mixed Team had four defensive lapses, but fortunately, Macleans' shots were inaccurate, and they failed to capitalize, missing countless opportunities under the basket, which was one of the reasons for their loss. Furthermore, Bliss was ejected first, and then their key player, Passcott, was also ejected, which led to their decline. Otherwise, Chen Bangzhen's two shots might not have had the chance to make a difference. Li Zhenzhong of the Mixed Team performed exceptionally well last night, scoring a game-high thirteen points. He scored four times in the second half, saving the overall situation, and his contribution cannot be overlooked. There were a total of twenty-seven fouls last night, with four players ejected, which demonstrates the intensity of the competition.</p>
<p>Macleans Attacks Fiercely</p>
<p>The referees were Qu Honglu and Bo Latuo. The Mixed Team initially fielded Er Chen (Xianglong Xuechong), Cai, Li, Sun, and Tian Bai, while Macleans countered with Liang Pai Wang and Bliss Hall. Xuechong scored under the basket to open the scoring. Wang Erde fouled, and Da Mao scored the free throw. Bliss quickly followed with a goal, and Zhenzhong immediately scored back a point, making it 4-2. Xianglong penetrated, and Bliss scored a free throw, while Sechin Du scored two consecutive goals, putting them ahead 7-4. Zhenzhong attempted a shot, and the ball went through the net. Bliss and Xuechong each scored a free throw. Macleans called a timeout. Qiao Maitaijiermuer replaced Wang Erde, and Paierya. The Mixed Team also replaced Li Zhenzhong with Zhou Da Yun. Cai and Bliss each scored a point. Xianglong scored, putting them back in the lead at 10-9. At this time, Macleans attacked fiercely but failed, missing consecutive shots. Xianglong committed his fourth foul and was forced to leave the court, which allowed Bliss to tie the score. Zhenzhong then scored one point, and Mai Taijie also scored a goal, ending the first half with Macleans 12 and the Mixed Team 11.</p>
<p>Chen Bangzhen Resurrects</p>
<p>Continuing the battle, Macleans' momentum intensified. Bliss scored, and Pielman scored two free throws in one go, adding six points. Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shot was effective, gaining two goals. Macleans had a poor start, calling a quick timeout, and indeed regained four points. Xuechong and Bliss each showed their skills, making it 24-17. The Mixed Team then replaced Zhou Yunda Yun with Shen Yugong. Then Macleans took the lead with 27-19. Zhenzhong Xuechong, both shooting and free throws, become Gan four to twenty-seven. Bliss committed his fourth foul and was ejected. Muer joined the battle. After Zhenzhong scored a goal, he also went off the field and award the last victory with four fouls. Transferring Da Yun to the battlefield, Passcott made one of the two free throws, Bliss also had four fouls, and Mai Taijie entered the field and immediately scored. The Mixed Team rushed to replace Li Zude, who had not been on the field for long, with Chen Bangzhen. Da Yun turned it into 28 to the state, which was still two points behind, and everyone was worried. The time was approaching. Unexpectedly, Bangzhen's half-court long shot leveled the score to 30. Then Bangzhen again used old tricks to secure the victory, until Da Yun threw the last ball and cheers followed. The mixed unit then thirty-four to thirty-one</p>

<h3>Film and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment... Lover in a Dream</p>
<p>The Shopworn Angel</p>
<p>The film depicts two young men and women who are swept up in different destinies. One is a truly sincere farm boy who is sent to the front lines of a merciless war. The other is a gold-digging showgirl whose soul is scarred and whose fate is precarious. They both seek satisfaction in "dreams" amidst a terrible reality, and dream-like "love" gives them much encouragement and comfort.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan plays a worldly-wise gold-digging showgirl in the film. She sacrifices the flattery of another wealthy man and, under special circumstances, accepts the love of another sincere young man who has already enlisted. Although she fully understands that the love between herself, who is accustomed to extravagance and debauchery, and this simple young man is absolutely impossible, she does so to fulfill the young man's dream, and marries him the moment before he leaves.</p>
<p>The film vividly and realistically depicts the mobilization situation in the United States when it participated in the European War, and the social dynamics full of tense war atmosphere. Margaret Sullavan's excellent performance in "Three Comrades" left us with an indelible impression. In this film, she also has a very satisfactory performance due to the suitability of her character. James Stewart's acting skills in the film are as excellent and moving as in "Seventh Heaven." Walter Pidgeon can also be praised.</p>
<p>Queen Peace Co-screening...Youth Takes A Fling</p>
<p>Youth Takes A Fling</p>
<p>The film depicts a loving female clerk who pursues the man she dreams of, but unfortunately, that man is somewhat foolish. Apart from being obsessed with a career at sea, nothing else is worth his attention, and women are of course no exception. Even the tender and beautiful female clerk's flattery is not appreciated by him at all. In the end, he even resolutely wants to avoid her entanglement, but the pain of seasickness breaks his dream of sailing and heals his ruthless problem.</p>
<p>Although the film does try to enrich its content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the shortcomings of the film's empty content. In terms of actors, Ann Blyth still has a charming performance. As for Zachery Scott, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his performance of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the center of interest in the film from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Oriental...Golden Heart Twists the Tongue</p>
<p>You're a Sweetheart</p>
<p>Produced by the New Universal Company, it features two singing stars, George Murphy and Alice Faye, several comedic stars, the old prankster Charles Winninger, and the silly Andy Devine. There are plenty of laughs, and the songs are also very pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>Dahua...Three Sisters</p>
<p>Sally, Irene and Mary</p>
<p>Alice Faye, Joan Davis, and Marjorie Weaver are close friends like three sisters here. Because of the economic downturn, they have worked as manicurists and cigarette girls in dance halls. Therefore, they met the singing star Tommy - Tony Martin - and Sally - Alice Faye - fell in love with him at first sight. Later, after many twists and turns, they got a dilapidated yacht. In order to renovate it into a floating nightclub, a large sum of money is needed. Sally and Tony are determined to make a deal: they are willing to marry two wealthy men who love them, as long as they can come up with the money. On the opening day of the floating nightclub, as if by Heaven's grace, the two male and female patrons who paid for it fell in love with each other. Everyone was delighted. Sally and Tony immediately got married, and even Jamie Duran, who worked as a cleaner, and Irene - Joan Davis - were inseparable and overjoyed.</p>
<p>The story is obviously a comedy. Jamie Duran and Joan Davis are the center of laughter. Phyllis Kennedy and Frank Albertson are also cold and interesting.</p>
<p>New World Continued Seven Fresh Roses</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The previous episode, "Seven Fresh Roses," ended with Ma Loufen marrying Lin Meimei. This episode begins with Lin giving birth to a child, followed by Ma and Lin's deteriorating relationship. At the same time, it recounts how Feng Feng and Xu Manli also experienced conflict after their marriage due to their poor relationship, leading to extreme outcomes. It then describes how Ma Loufen unexpectedly meets Xu Manli, and the two fall in love. The old couple discovers this, revealing that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. As a result, both sides realize their mistakes. Ma History disappears from society, and is eventually moved by his son and returns home, reconciling with Lin.</p>
<p>In order to cater to low-level audiences, the plot is forced and unbelievable, and the acting is also lackluster. The old-fashioned approach makes the audience dislike it.</p>
<p>Central...Hu Huigan Fights the Machine Room</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Due to the excellent box office success of "Fang Shiyu Fights on the Stage," smart producers seized the business opportunity. This film is a product of that motivation.</p>
<p>Hu Xiqian is weak and incompetent, and is bullied by people in the machine room. His father was killed, and they even want to take his wife and younger sister. Forced by the circumstances, Hu Huigan decides to run the machine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can avenge his father in the future. After many hardships and dangers, he happily returns one day and finally avenges his father. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no skills to speak of. Li Shanxiao changes his style to play Hu Huigan, and his performance is acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time, and makes a comeback in this film, with a good performance. The set design is too simple, and several fight scenes lack tension.</p>
<p>Lee Theatre High Sheng Co-screening...Hua Mulan</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>The plot depicts a modern woman who wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan" because she once played "Hua Mulan" on stage. Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovered a well-organized traitorous organization, so she and her lover, Jie Shanxiao, jointly try to crack the secret agency and steal documents. After unknown difficulties, they finally achieved their goal, and even the clever and foolish traitors were moved by their great spirit and jointly set off to the front line.</p>
<p>We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot use the techniques of cinema. Zheng Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang act well.</p>
<p>Taiping...The Story of the Heroic Sons and Daughters</p>
<p>National film</p>
<p>Because it does not have the unreasonable elements of supernatural films, this film from Xinhua Company is not too bad, although it cannot be said to have any particularly good achievements. Many places in the play that should be tense are passed over plainly. Gu Lanjun - the female star who has become popular after the war - performs well.</p>

<h3>Literary Resistance and Collective Creation</h3>
<p>— Yun Jie</p>
<p>In the creative practice of literary resistance, we need to especially emphasize collective creation, this new type of progressive method, because it is humanity's newest and most advanced tool for artistically understanding and expressing the world, the most powerful method. Only by applying this new and powerful method, through the collective process of understanding and expression, can we most precisely, accurately, and vividly reflect the urgent and turbulent reality of resistance currently facing China, revealing the intricacies, twists, turns, and developments of the reality of China's resistance, as well as the essence and future of these changes and developments. The most basic task of literary resistance lies in faithfully and accurately reflecting the current state of resistance. Therefore, collective creation, as the method that is best at understanding and expressing objective truth, and most capable of unearthing and reflecting the truth of reality, becomes a creative mode that should be particularly emphasized and focused on in the creative and practical activities of literary resistance. Moreover, because literary resistance is politically organized, it must organize all literary workers into the united front of the anti-Japanese national salvation revolution, so it is even more necessary to particularly emphasize and focus on the technically organized nature, which can organize a broad range of writers or literary youth for collective creation, making it its basic creative method. Through its technical organization, it will build the political organization of literary resistance.</p>
<p>Collective creation is a new path in the development of thousands of years of artistic practice, a new technology in human literary creation. This new technology is already being applied in practice by various international writers, and it has already achieved good results. For example, "One Day of the World," "History of the Civil War," and "History of the Factory," hosted by the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, and the "Encyclopedia" edited by the International Association for the Defense of Culture, are all excellent achievements of collective creation by international writers. As for China, we can also see "One Day of China," edited by the Chinese Literature Society, "The 25,000 Li March," edited by Ding Ling, and many other excellent creative plays and novels. All these artistic achievements are sufficient to prove that collective creation is a sound and precise creative method, proving the excellence of this method in reflecting reality.</p>
<p>So-called collective creation refers to organizing a group of writers to engage in creation together under a specific key program outline, or under a specific theme and subject matter, collectively handling the expression of the theme, collectively engaging in the collection of materials, and even the artistic generalization, structure, layout, the development of the theme, the character, posture, speech, behavior, and descriptive techniques of the characters, and the choice of language and rhetoric, all of which are discussed and determined collectively. The creative activity is then completed through the collective process of expression and modification. This creative method can integrate the literary techniques and styles, personalities, and understandings of various writers into new artistic crystallizations, thereby creating more abundant and excellent collective literary works than individual creation. As for whether a writer's participation in collective creation will limit his personal special talents and the development of his genius, our answer to this question is negative. We know that collectivism and individuality (the individual) are not opposed. Collectivism merely unifies each individual within a correct cognitive framework, guiding and influencing individuality, so that it transforms itself in the process of practice. Therefore, a literary resistance writer's participation in collective creation will not only not hinder the development of his individuality and genius, but also, due to the collective's supervision, guidance, and influence, the writer's subjectivity will be able to increasingly develop along with the objective reality of resistance, his genius will become more perfect, and his individuality and style will be able to obtain good development, overcoming his own inherent shortcomings, so that his genius, individuality, style, and understanding are all integrated into collective practice, creating higher-level and more excellent collective artistic crystallizations. This collective artistic crystallization has a higher level of significance in terms of artistic value.</p>
<h3>"Comprehensive Mirror for Governance"</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>These past few days, I happened to read Yuwen Mouzhao's "History of the Great Jin Dynasty" and saw the articles on the enthronement of Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu by the Jin emperor. After carefully reading these two articles, I deeply admire the intelligence of the Jin emperor. His tone of cordiality is truly similar to that of people today, and his wishful thinking plans are also similar to those of people today. This is truly a mirror for our times, so I borrow the four characters "Comprehensive Mirror for Governance" as the title and excerpt them below for public appreciation:</p>
<p>(1) Proclamation Establishing Zhang Bangchang:</p>
<p>"... Considering that the Song dynasty was truly a friendly neighbor... Heaven was disgusted with their virtue, and the people could not make a living: yet they still sought to blame others and did not know how to reflect on themselves... Therefore, His Majesty ordered generals to punish the guilty and comfort the people... Now that the country lacks a ruler, the people should be united. However, considering its origins, it was truly not a poor land, so the Marshal's Office was ordered to recommend a worthy man..."</p>
<p>(2) Proclamation Establishing Liu Yu:</p>
<p>"... Not annexing your territory shows the virtue of not being greedy; only moving its ruler demonstrates the heart of punishing the guilty... We hereby appoint you, Liu Yu... Living in a chaotic country, born in an unfavorable era. Even a hundred-mile talent cannot compensate for the fall of Yu, and the lofty Three Benevolences may wish to serve the Zhou... Granting you territory, together with the former Chu; further, you must appease and gather the people, and reside where you are suitable. May you above conform to Heaven's will, and below follow the people's desires, be loyal in protecting the royal house, and faithful in guarding the borders..."</p>
<p>Look! In the first article, phrases like "punishing the guilty and comforting the people" and "truly not greedy for land" are so high-sounding and grand. The second article reiterates at the beginning "truly not greedy for land"; the middle section praises Liu Yu as much as possible, elevating the status of the traitor, how could the traitors not be moved to tears; the final paragraph instructs the traitor's task, which is to establish a new order and become a slave of the Great Jin. These two articles are well-organized and profound in meaning. I feel that the Jin emperor can be considered the inventor of "using Chinese to control Chinese"!</p>
<h3>Ruins and Gunsmoke</h3>
<p>— Written by Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin</p>
<p>A couple came to the battlefield together, which of course required great determination. In the conversation, the life of this photographer unconsciously became the center of our interest. A slender town stretches along the lakeside. The houses on both sides, the roofs, have all collapsed. Seeing that the property of every civilian is scattered haphazardly in the countryside, it is clear that the residents have all fled alone. According to Colonel Inoue, the town of Hukou was not destroyed by shelling and explosions, but by the sound waves of the shells. There was no wind disaster, no flood, and no earthquake in thousands of years. Is it possible that the old buildings, which had preserved their vitality in decline, were destroyed by the sound of man-made shells? Thinking about it this way, the town of Hukou, which had suppressed the leisurely human emotions in its old history and survived to this day, has been reduced to ruins and perished. However, it may not be possible for the residents to return safely and immediately resume their previous lives. The tiles of the roof, which had collapsed horizontally, would immediately be pressed into the tiles by my fingertip. It is a bit incredible to think that such dilapidated houses have been able to withstand the wind and rain until now. In such an old city, the citizens seemed to be living day by day under fanatical emotions. Looking into the doorways of the destroyed houses, every house had a blackened altar in the depths. The anti-Japanese sentiment stirred up by the government was not produced by theory, but seemed to have dissolved into their beliefs unconsciously over the years. The walls of the large warehouses and the stone walls of the temples, like those in other places, were covered with fierce propaganda slogans. I had just seen the slogans "Roar, China!" and "The Three Principles of the People are the Doctrine of National Salvation!", but I immediately discovered that in the middle of the street, in front of a small Western-style building with the sign "Hukou Branch of the Shanghai Shen Bao," there was a large slogan covered in fresh ink: "Good men should shed their blood on the battlefield." Outside the city, there was a house with a magnificent facade, with neatly arranged signs hanging on both sides of the door. Reading them one by one: "Hukou County Judicial Office," "Hukou County Government Tax Collection Office," "Jiangxi Hukou County Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee," "Hukou County Police Team," "Hukou County Anti-Japanese Propaganda Department," "Jiangxi Provincial Air Defense Association Hukou County Branch," "Hukou County Social Military Training General Affairs Department," "Jiangxi Province Hukou County Veterans Association," "Hukou County New Life Movement Promotion Association"—</p>
<p>On the roof, like unifying all the institutions, hung a wooden plaque: "Long-Term Resistance I". The intention of the national government to promote all functions and cultivate anti-Japanese feelings is deeply rooted in the shade of these neatly arranged signs. On the opposite side of the mountains surrounding the three sides, the guerrillas were still active. Hukou was still surrounded by the × people (referring to our army, similarly below - translator). The small Japanese army constantly moved its troops to contain the × people. The large units of the × people appeared and disappeared unpredictably, so they could not rest easy for a moment. Colonel Inoue also took a small steamship to navigate the riverbank to detect the deep water the day before yesterday. It was dawn, the fog was gradually dissipating, and it was clearing up. From the opposite bank in front of us, we saw people waving the Rising Sun Flag. Confirming that they were Japanese soldiers, they steered the boat to the opposite bank. When they reached the shore, they saw five or six soldiers lying collapsed on the dew-covered grass as if they were dead. The one waving the flag was the sergeant, and the three fallen soldiers were his subordinates. While walking on the street, Colonel Inoue said in a focused tone. Yes, yes - a man with an interesting name. He's called Sergeant Hiwei. He was sent out as a scout two days ago to detect whether there were × positions. At some point, he walked into the large unit of the enemy gathered at the foot of the mountain. He couldn't move forward or backward, all around him were enemies. He finally managed to reach this riverbank, it was seven o'clock the next afternoon. In short, it was extremely hard work. He didn't know if it was safe to go in that direction, he didn't eat or drink, and he couldn't go five miles away from the Yangtze River bank. In the end, his body couldn't move any more and he collapsed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Echo</h3>
<p>— Translated by Pian Yao</p>
<p>The dense jungle, through the faint light of a cold moon, casts scattered, old shadows of branches on the ground. From the gaps between the tree trunks, one can faintly hear one or two dog barks and see one or two dim fishing lights in the distance. Here, over a hundred young people have gathered, all of whom are wanderers from distant places, having lost their homes and villages. They have been wandering for more than a month, walking over two hundred miles, having avoided × people's bombing and burning, and finally arrived here.</p>
<p>They share one heart, one unyielding, fearless determination to die for their country; preparing to depart tomorrow, they take advantage of this quiet, moonlit night to discuss everything in that broad, dense forest.</p>
<p>They are all sitting on the ground, some with handbooks and pencils in their hands, earnestly writing. Suddenly, on top of a half-collapsed earthen wall, stands a man in a Zhongshan suit, with dark skin and a dusty face, about thirty years old, holding a few books (or perhaps these are official documents), speaking to the crowd.</p>
<p>This is probably the captain. He shouts excitedly and resolutely: "Comrades! From this moment on, we are all one family. Everyone in this group has no home. Our parents, brothers, sisters have all been brutally murdered by the × people. What else do we have to worry about?"</p>
<p>At this point, two sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls in the队伍 were moved and wiped away their tears with their face towels. However, under the bright moonlight, they were immediately discovered by the captain.</p>
<p>"Comrades! Change your attitude! We should not be sentimental, we should be indignant, we should not shed tears, we should understand, who made us like this? This question can only be truly answered by our resolute struggle..."</p>
<p>"...Tomorrow, we will return to continue our work. Before we depart, if each squad has any questions, feel free to raise them now."</p>
<p>After the captain finished speaking, everyone was silent for a few minutes. Suddenly, a squad leader stood up and asked: "Commander, the comrades in our squad have a common opinion, which is to request the cotton-padded clothes from above. At the same time, we hope to be armed."</p>
<p>The captain replied without hesitation: "Currently, because we cannot communicate with the higher authorities, the issue of cotton-padded clothes will be temporarily shelved. As long as everyone maintains a courageous spirit, the cold will not be too noticeable; as for bullets, we must remember the outline of guerrilla tactics, and only open fire when the enemy reaches a certain distance, within the standard of our range. We must avoid firing haphazardly, wasting bullets. When necessary, we can seize the × people's yellow-uniform clothing to keep us warm, and seize the × people's weapons and food to be our weapons and food." Everyone was excited by these words. Finally, the captain asked everyone for a firm response, which was: "Our squad will share life and death, advance and retreat together, are you all willing?"</p>
<p>"Willing!" Like thunder, it shook the silent jungle, and over a hundred hands were raised high. Everyone was almost moved to tears, and finally returned to the ranks sadly and solemnly, and walked out of the forest, singing loudly:</p>
<p>"...We must defend our motherland,</p>
<p>We all rush to the battlefield...</p>
<p>...Defend...breaking through all evil forces</p>
<p>Implementing—implementing the principles of the Premier..." (Song of Departure.)</p>
<p>The crystal-clear moon has set in the west, the sky is only flickering with a few dim stars, the rooster has crowed loudly, the forest has returned to its original silence, only hearing the magnificent echo of a piece of 'Departure' song.</p>
<h3>Fascist Elites</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Today, literary figures in fascist countries have only two paths: one is to submit to the authority of fascism, the higher-ups manufacturing distorted and deceptive "theories" for fascism, and the lower-ups simply acting as cheerleaders; the other path is to go underground, engaging in heroic struggles against fascism. So, ultimately, the only true path is the latter. Although the former is a temporary path, it is actually a dead end.</p>
<p>But just as Jesus said, "The gate of heaven is narrow, and only a few can enter." The true path for literary figures in fascist countries is also extremely narrow. Without absolute faith in justice and truth, without a spirit that sacrifices personal life and above, it is difficult to step onto this path. Thus, we see the large-scale appearance of so-called "turncoat" literary figures.</p>
<p>In fascist countries, literary "conversion" signifies the decline of literary figures. It shows that these people once were fascinated by truth, or even fought for truth. But because their faith was weak, they could not withstand the threat of violence, and as a result, they had to "turn" towards a dead end. However, as mentioned in another article, whether in international politics, domestic politics, or in personal beliefs, concession to fascism is tantamount to digging one's own grave. From the following "salute" of Japanese fascists to the "converted" literary figures, we can see that a "converted" literary figure's one misstep results in eternal regret.</p>
<p>"...Many turncoats, like autumn leaves, have fallen from the proletarian movement. I cannot help but angrily denounce them. This is not because they left my camp. From a standpoint, they are even closer to me. However, I really feel uncomfortable with the lack of integrity of this kind of thinking. Turning is turning, but waiting until the movement is in difficulty and then turning again is extremely despicable.</p>
<p>'It is strange that Japanese society can tolerate so many fickle characters.' (Sugiama Hei’suke, 'China, the Chinese People, and Japan,' page 140)</p>
<p>'Until recently, people who have been breathing in the air of liberalism have suddenly transformed themselves into warriors for mainland advancement, and have unusually mocked the people of neighboring countries. The motives for this behavior are not asked for the moment, but where have these people's intellects gone? Where have their years of theories and integrity flowed to?</p>
<p>The same can be said for converts to Marxism. Until recently, Marx's and Engels' trumpeters believed that truth only existed in these people's pens, and measured everything from this perspective. They looked down on, ignored, denounced, and attacked everything else, with the idea that the earth would soon be transformed into Marx's kingdom: they single-mindedly preached this gospel and regarded themselves as martyrs. But at what point did these people suddenly start preaching Eastern culture, Japanese culture, and appearing as new players in the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere?' (Murofushi Takanobu, article 'Reconstruction of Intellect,' 'Japan Review,' January issue)</p>
<p>At first glance, one might think that this is a battle between Japanese liberals and Marxist warriors scolding their traitors, but in reality, it is the sneer of fascist mouthpieces towards "converted" literary figures. Although they put on a moral face on the back and gave a "salute" with ulterior motives, in our opinion, the patting is useful, and the mockery only shows that they have "foresight". They have already thrown themselves at the master, and show a hideous face to the "converted" who want to share a piece of the reward.</p>
<p>People with little faith, the bone you are coveting is already in someone else's mouth!</p>
<p>But in our country, if those who are迷于 Trotkyist and pro-Han ideas are willing to suddenly wake up, the significance of this and the "conversion" of the Japanese people are absolutely different, because the watershed here is justice. There is no ridicule, no sarcasm here, but a welcome to the lost sheep.</p>
