<h3 id="c1">迅速擴大我國空軍 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>這幾天我國空軍陸續出發各戰區轟炸×陣，尤其是華南方面，外國電訊會一再傳出我國空軍英勇襲×的消息。同時擴大空的消息，近來亦甚囂塵上。瞻念第二期抗戰前途，令人發生無限興奮與期待之情。我國的空軍。雖然還祇有短短的幾年歷史，可是在抗戰中已充分發揮了它的威力：不僅轟炸×軍陣地，獲得很大我的功績，而且還有出國示成的壯舉。最近又乘侵粵×軍負嵎頑抗的時候，四出活動，在珠江下游炸沉了兩艘×艦。我國空軍所以能有這樣的偉大建樹，能光榮地盡其衞國的責任，實不得不歸功于中央政府和蔣委員長的努力提倡及全體國民的踴躍輸將。</p>
<p>×軍侵收我國，不但把空軍作爲輔助的武力，且竟用以解決若千重要戰略上的問題。往往大規模出動，以攻擊我國任何地點。最近因我國抗戰轉入第二期，全面戰爭展開，各路×軍無不受到牽制，一籌莫展；于是便派遣大批空軍。四出轟炸我國的不設防地，殺害大批平民。以期打破我國人民的抗戰意志。可是這種恐嚇行爲，不但沒有效果，反使我國人的認識更爲淸楚。抗戰意志更爲堅强同時更激怒了友邦的空軍勇士，因不忍坐視這種非人道的襲擊，都自願到我國來加入空軍，對日作戰。近傳已有五百外籍機師，秘密到華，參加戰爭。這是很值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>空軍是攻擊的武力。在我國抗戰轉入第二期，戰略由被動變爲主動，行將舉行全面反攻的時侯，爲了打擊×軍後方，破壞×軍交通聯絡，削弱×軍力量，增強×軍困難，以至於用以解决若千重要戰略上的問題。則充實空軍自是很重要的。所以我國現又積極擴大空軍組織，增強空軍實力，除已向美國白蘭伽飛機公司訂購轟炸機二百架外，並决定接受外機師加入空軍對日作戰的要求，而新空軍亦將於最近期內編成，出動作戰。這種積極的設施，也是很値得重視的。</p>
<p>不過空軍旣是攻擊的主要武力，則飛機和空軍人材的消耗率，一定很高，欲求抗戰的最後勝利，不得不保持空軍的優勢，欲保持空軍的優勢，自必須要能够隨時予以迅速地補充。爲求達到這個目的起見，我們提出了下列二點意見：</p>
<p>第一，優越的飛機補充力是有賴於工業上和機械上的效率的。我國軍事工業的落後，是不容否認的　實。在目前，飛機的供給，還不能不仰給於國外，這是抗戰期內最咸困難的事情。所以目前要儘量發展軍事國防工業，應具有擴大製造飛機事業的决心和執行切實易行的製造計劃，同時還應該盡量發展製造零件和修理的工廠，俾在未能大量製造飛機以前，能迅連修理損壤。其次，因爲目前飛機尙不能不仰給於國外，需要大量　金，向國外購置，所以我國人民仍應繼續並擴大捐欵購機運動。以購機祝壽的精神來發動購機稅捷運動。</p>
<p>第二，優秀空軍人材的補充又是有賴，積極的訓練的。在技術比較落後的我國，聘請學識經騐均甚豐富的外籍專家担任訓練，雖仍屬必要，但從抗戰中鍛鍊出來的戰士也應該被視為敎練的幹部。同時，最好派遣大批靑年到航本技術高超的國家去求深造，以提高我國穴軍人材的訓練。而在國內增設航空學校，大量培養具有堅强的抗戰决心和犧牲决心的航空人材，也屬必要。</p>
<p>我國空軍任過去雖有偉大的貢獻，但將來的任務更重大，要完成這更重大的任務，我國當局必須迅速地把它擴大和强化起來。</p>
<h3 id="c2">世界動向一週間　從廿八年一月十四日至二十日 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 潘郎</p>
<p>這一個星期，又從漫天烽火和舉世喧擾中過去了。在遠東，在歐西，因爲日德意三個法西斯侵略國家的瘋狂縱火，幾乎整片的天地都給燃　了；而且這種火焰又在向地中海，向太平洋各地菱延，但同時，中國和西班牙堅　抗抵與英勇救火的呼喊和行動，却終於得到英美法蘇各國的響應和援助，英美法相繼向日通牒厲警吿。便是一個例子。我們囘首正在×人砲火下的同胞，和正在×人加緊壓榨下的日德意國民衆，眞有無限的創痛，但看到目前的重重因難險阻，和未來的光明前途，却又發無限生興奮和無限期待之情。</p>
<p>一週間抗戰形勢</p>
<p>日本侵華部隊，經過三個月的理整並且華北華　總司令也一律更　，但是毫無成就。最近　要配合平沼新內閣之所謂總攻，以便對內振作民心對外掩飾敗續起見，纔　得不先後發動了西北和西南的試探性的總攻。因此　個星期，各戰場都月激戰發生。先說華北，×軍自從歲首的五路　攻失敗以後，積極增援晋南豫北各地，並招集殘餘主力，由向蒲綫沿各公路開往汾西大舉反攻，企圖由河津禹門強渡黄河成脅西安。連日戰　界常激烈。所幸我呂梁山各要地相繼克復，進克離石中陽稷山的我軍，又把竄犯之×分段切斷。現在×軍仍在凖備大舉西犯，但我西北軍事已經佈置完成。而八路車已經深人熱河，捲起×軍後方，東北各省的戰火，綏　兩省游擊戰爭亦有進展，顯然已把西犯的×軍孤立起來。其次，華南×軍再度猛烈北犯，從化花縣一帶，戰事異常激烈，但×軍　未越過太平塲。西江和南路一帶，×軍未敢　動，祗是海陸兩途，均在積極增援情勢日趨緊張。至於東江各地，我軍連日採取攻勢，×軍已被迫退守。現在西南行營積極佈置下，華南戰局，可無憂慮。華中方面，本週較爲沉寂。但長江兩岸游擊區戰鬥則極有進展。抗州被我包圍，×軍已有棄守模樣。蘇州附近一月來大小三百餘戰，殲×亦達四千以上。而據第三戰區顧祝同將軍談話，東戰場我軍，確已進入反攻階段了。綜觀全局，×雖亟圖蠢動，很我已確佔主動優勢。日最近一星期內，僅晉粵兩地，已殲×達兩萬餘人。現在全部軍事部署，大致完成；而戰地黨政委員會的普遍創設，粵省戰區督　圑的組織，西北新軍工業的發展，以及國外軍火源源運　，與蘇美兩國大批軍事術專家的投効等等，都是本週內値得特別報吿的好消息。</p>
<p>省政黨政大革新</p>
<p>配台着抗戰軍事的新發展，各省黨政機協和人事也都急需改善，陜湘兩省政府的改組，已於十七日由行政院會議决定。陜西方面，軍政都有更調，稈潛就任西北行營主任，衛立煌孫運仲兩個迭與八路軍協同忠勇領導抗戰的軍人，已經分任第一戰區正副司令長官，蔣期文則免去西安行為主任職務，專主省政。至於湖南之任領導抗戰　著　續的薛岳爲主席，也完全爲了戰時需要。此外戰區各省政府，都有冉度改組的凖備。如李宗仁之將主鄂，孫連　之將主豫，雖不見諸事實，但爲使各省行政與二期抗戰軍事密切配合起見。這種凖備也確有可能與必要。又據本　報重慶航信，「戰區黨政委會擴大組織，由國民黨總裁蔣中正先生自兼委員長，李濟琛任副委員長，設委員七至八人，四人由國民黨員充任，二至三人由共產黨員充任，委員人選除周恩來已確定外，餘尚在銓衡中。』這也値得十分重視。因爲過去抗戰十八個月中間，軍事上政治上雖有空前進步，但是這種進步還不足以停止×人的進攻，發動我軍的反攻，而進步途上的障礙則仍嚴重存在，尤其是抗日戰綫的不够鞏固。黨派磨擦現象的繼續發展等。黨政委會的擴大組織，自是最好的補救方法，一方面也可根本粉碎×人漢好借反共反八路軍反邊區等口號以破壞我團結的　謀，而對於動員全民完成抗戰建國事業，一定有很大的助益，希望經過這次五中全會，能够迅速成爲事實。</p>
<p>五中全會開幕！</p>
<p>抗戰進入新階段，一方面有許多新的進步與成功，使人興奮，另方面也有許多新的困難，急侍解决。領導全國抗戰建國的最大政黨國民黨，適在此時召開中央全體會議，自然値得中外一致的注視。</p>
<p>據美聯社稱這次全會內議題將是：（一）重行宣示國策，以增强長期抗戰力量。擁護蔣委員長及政府領袖：（二）加緊團結，增强抗日陣綫，集中全國人力物力以明最後勝利；（三）聯合一切同情中國之民治國家，組成國際抗日陣綫；（四）設立特別機關以聯絡各黨各派；（五）改組「三民主義靑年圑」以容納各黨各派之肯年；（六）增强民治組織，從速設立各省市縣國民參政會議；（七）改善縣行政組織：（八）改善國民兵役；（九）　底肅　漢奸；（十）改良軍隊作戰能力；（十一）組織學生軍；（十二）增强軍隊政訓組織；（十三）提髙軍隊物質生活并增進軍民合作，（十四）實施經濟政策及建設軍需工業；（十五）沒收一切漢奸財產；（十六）鼓勵富人捐輸；（十七）再行减此政府各級　吏薪　；（十八）减免苛捐雜稅增加戰時生產；（十九）徵收財產畢進稅；（廿）改良人民生活解决靑年失業問題；（廿一）推廣節約　動；（廿二）保障人民出版集會結社等自由；（廿三）推行民衆運動：（廿四）實施戰時敎育，以增强抗戰力量。這些都是目前階　急侍解决的問題，也是全國人民共同要求公正解决的問題，連共產黨六中全會所提出各點，亦大都包含在內，更足見國　黨　央的眞止態度，我們全國民衆海外僑胞要用一切方法來擁護中央，擁護五中全會能給×人漢奸以最致命的打擊，而展開了中華民挨空前進步光榮的一買。</p>
<p>英美法聯合制日</p>
<p>祗有全中國團結堅持抗戰，才能爭取國際更多更大的援助，也祗有配合着國際更多更大的援助，我們抗戰建國才能提前成功。現在英美法各國也像蘇聯一　地爲我國的團結抗戰所感動，所信任，爲了保障他們本身利益和世界和乎，已經開始採取　積極　援華制日步驟了。繼去年年底美國對日强硬通牒之後，英國政府亦於本月十四日向日　送『中日戰爭後英政府空前强硬』的　會，表示絕不承認武力造或的任何形勢，堅决反對日本所謂東亞新秩序，反對破壞九國公約；而且更較明顯地表示出英國對遠東政策將與美國立於同一戰綫。至本月十九日，法國政府亦有同樣强硬牒文送致日方，與英美兩國採取一致態度。於是英美法各國聯合對日實施報復的呼聲，立刻從歐洲　美洲，到亞洲，傳遍了全世界，四萬萬求自由的民衆爲之振奮，日本侵略者乃不禁震顫失態。他們一面嗾　國內各報濫　狂言，對英美法各國的援助我國，大肆詆責，表示無限怨憤；一面則運用外交手腕。由外務省方面非止式地發出『日本準備談判』的欺僞談話，企圖緩和各國反日情緒。然而事實上日本在遠　發展與英美法蘇及全世界和平正義人士的理想，顯不和容，日本侵略者這種狡計終難獲逞。現在　帶報告幾件國際援華新事實：（一）十一日重慶國民外交會收到世界學囌代表來函，現有五十四國靑年願爲援助中國抗戰而奮鬥，在世界靑年會議决定組織兩　專鬥委員會援助我國；（二）中美借欵成立後，首批軍火已於本週迷到；（三）蘇聯與英美法等國已有飛行人員五百餘來華參加抗戰；（四）國際救濟會主席美人費吳生十七日宣言美國千百萬人民正在爲援華抗日而奮鬥。</p>
<p>國聯行政院常會</p>
<p>國聯行政院一〇三屆常會，於本月十六日　會。這次會議的軍要問題，第一是西班牙撤退志願軍問題，第二是我國要求制裁日本案。我國代表顧維鈞於十七日發　强力演說，要求（一）對日施行財政與經濟的制裁。（二）國聯會員國一律抵制一切日貨。（三）禁運日本可　作製造軍用　的原料赴日。（四）特別禁運飛與汽油，（五）國聯會員國對華作有效的經濟援助，（六）使軍用品運華的簡單化，（七）在行政院中設立一特別委員會，由一切在遠東有利益關係的國家參加，老慮各會員國對日應採的方法，以及阻止其　續戰爭。顧氏還特別指出其他各國援助中國，驅逐侵略者，亦即爲其自身謀利益，因爲中國一旦解放，則對於世界貿易，將有重大貢献。中國全國圑結，軍隊悉採新戰略，前途已轉光明；各國若更切實協助。則勝利卽在目前。十八，十九兩日中央法蘇四國代表組成的委員會，先後舉行不公開會議，十九日下午行政院召集秘密會議，討論我國申請的各點。在英法對法西斯侵略者的妥協政策尙未根本放棄以前，我們對於國　，固然仍舊不能存何奢望。但是目前國際形勢，確已激劇轉向於我有利，我們必須把握時機，在自力更生原則下，力爭更多更大的外援。美國方面現已組織專門討論經制裁的委員會，這於國聯各國，應有相當啓示作用。我們必須更廣泛地動員中外輿論，發動全世界反法西斯反侵略的羣衆運動，督促各國政府切實施行聯台制栽法西斯侵略者的政策。</p>
<p>日本策動新陰謀</p>
<p>國際形勢一天一天的趨向於對日不利。日本方面便即發出和平論調，聲明願與英國共同促進　平，並對美國表示日本願意談判開放中國市場。十八日晚日本駐英大使，光葵在宴會上發表的××演詞，便是一個例子。但是實際上日本政府的外交政策，已經完全成爲法西斯軍閥用以遂行　戰略企圖的御用工具，日本這種欺騙的狡計，早爲國際所共見。而且平沼內閣準備在今天（廿日）公佈的施政綱領，就明白規定：（一）日本將根據其不變之政策堅决達到此次對付中國事變所　之目的，（二）日本建議創設東亞新秩　，將沿「乾坤大道』而實踐之，（三）日本　仍將續擊破排日德國民黨政權，（四）日本將努力促進與第三國間之了解，（五）日本對於此次中日戰爭之最後目的在於日『滿」華三國間之合作，及中國之「改造」，（六）因目前仍有不少阻碍，故全國之資源，應悉數集中以期達到此目的，此外平沼又擬要求國會核准其預算案及其他各法案。有田外相並將發長外交演說，設明：「（一）日本外交政策在『東亞新秩序」之建設（二）第三國迄今未能了解日本之眞意，日本對第三國經由西南及其他綫路輸武器入中國，援助中國抗戰後决取必要措置。更充滿了恐嚇口吻。」此外如軍部的改組。全國動員機　的强化，陸海空軍大擴充的計劃，都足証日本征服中國以至征服太平洋的野心。</p>
<p>侵略國家的末路</p>
<p>法四斯侵略各國的瘋什準備擴大戰爭，除了日本之外，德意兩國在本週內的　　極可注意。先說德國，一面竭力拉攏痰蘭。戈林及里賓特洛甫等均將赴波活動，一面　用匈　利，致有匈　利退出國　加人反共協定等事實，同時德土放欵協定成立，深入　東的陰謀，也算初步　到；於是而進攻荷蘭，煽亂愛爾蘭等『炸彈消息』，就在報紙上出現了！再說意國，這次英意議馬談判，雖然未能獲得預期的成功，但張伯倫拉達第尙無武裝保衛和平的决心，已極明顯，因此他就一　加緊　攻西班牙的步驟，企圖迅速推翻　班牙共和政府，樹立他在西班牙的軍事及經濟的基礎；一面再度展開反法運動，積極增兵北菲東非，及加緊獨覇地中　的軍事準備。德意兩國這進一步的侵略行動，不僅完全聯合一致，甚至與東方的日本亦有密切聯絡。日外相有田月已發表將在今天演設的內容，　白誇耀一日德　反共協定近因匈牙利及　　國的加人，已達世界反共陣營的理想並與主張　持現狀的國家對立起來」。不過略國家加培猖　，而其內部危機却已達到無　掩飾與挽救的地步。美國著名記者辛穆斯於本月十日在盛頓曾公開揭　　國內部鬥爭漸趨嚴重，工人怠　反對戰爭的進動近更如火如荼！日本經濟危機，更形嚴重，主要的是材料缺乏，輸出　額　减，黄金枯竭，外匯基金吿磬，通貨膨脤，民衆生活維艱。平沼內閣對此　只能運用加　的武力向人民榨取支持戰事的經費！</p>
<p>蘇聯在順利邁進</p>
<p>在這個戰火彌漫的世界，只有蘇聯，正在社會主義的領導之下，勝利地　自由幸福之途邁進。他們抱定以武力維護和平與帮助被壓迫民族解的政策，不屈不撓的鬥　。今天一月廿一日。他們爲要紀念全世　的革命領袖列寧，展開了全國規模的羣衆運動，他們將向日德意等　西斯侵略者發出嚴重的警吿，同時將向英勇團結抵抗反略的中國和西班牙兩國五萬萬以上的人民表示最敬禮。他們已經準備用充實海空兩車力量的事實來作種警吿與敬禮的保證。蘇聯最髙會議，已將國防工業人民委員會分爲航空，造縊，彈藥，軍備四個委負會，海軍和械兩委員會亦將力謀發展。至今年元旦爲止，飛機產額已提髙百分之十五至二十六。其他國防工業均將發展一有關國防的人民委員會將建立達廿九個之多，預算　增加的十萬萬鎊中，有四萬萬將用於發展軍事工業。同時他們號召法斯侵略國家壓　下的人民，一致團結到反法西斯反侵略的大旗之下，合力制正新的帝國主義戰爭。廿一年來蘇聯從最危最困苦最貧乏之中達到今日最强盛最自由　幸福的經歷，正是我們今日抗戰　的好榜樣，而兮日正在勝利邁進　的蘇聯，又與全世界民主　平各國一致，成爲我們的友軍。我們還有什麽理由悲觀與畏怯呢　力吧！我們的隊伍是全世界最廣大最强壯的！</p>

<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>我們要運用這個戰術，發　抗戰的效能，還有幾個最重要的條件：第一就是髙級指揮官要有堅定不移的决心。决心攻擊，必攻擊成功而後已；决心固守，卽守至最後一人而不退。决心旣定，意闡明確，不以小挫而動搖，不致半途而中輟，如此，　能達成攻守的任務，我近來接見前方歸來的軍官，他們說此次作戰，般不利的一件事，就是我們髙級指揮官沒有决心，或决心不够，對于應該守的地方，沒有眞正死守的决心，不必固守的地方，却耗了許多不必要的犧牲！並且說：「命令我們攻，未見其有必須攻克的决心，往往攻到半途，又令我們停下，要我們守、亦未見其有必須固守的意圖，往往守不到一些時候，就要我們退出！其實，我們部下只要、級指揮官有决心，認爲某一城鎭必要攻下。或其一陣地必須死守，我們奉到命令，除非官兵全部犧牲，否則一定要拚命作到！所以今後作戰，攻守大計姿决斷明確，命令决　要堅定不移，凡屬應該守的地方，就下命死守，雖犧牲只剩一人，我們亦必效死勿去；凡屬應攻克的地方，就下命攻擊，雖阻難至於極端，我們亦必拚死攻下！他們這個批評，極有價值，各位髙級指揮官，須特別注意。尤其各部隊參　長和參謀處長，要留心改進，並要將這些意思轉吿各級指揮官，切實作到！以後作戰决心必須緊定，命令纔能貫　；命令能够貫澈，勝利方有把握！　（未完）</p>

<p>各省省政府。省黨部，市政府，市黨部轉全國各地士紳及敎育界同胞均鑒、抗戰已入後期，成敗與亡，胥視吾人能否發揚民族正氣，以充實長久戰鬥之實力；而尤賴全國市區鄉鎭物望所歸之人士，毅然以救亡圖存爲已任·我國數千年來，以忠孝爲立國之本，修身濟世，視此爲基，家諭戶院，深入人心，合之者則舉世欽　，違之者則其肉不齒，此實我組尤腎哲，苦心發揚，蔚爲風氣，特　錘鍊民族齊一意志，以爲生存奮鬥之資也。總理閘論我民族道德，特標忠孝　首，　當今日與暴×互爭生死存亡之時期，更非　人能誓死效忠於國家，竭力盡孝於民族，無以復興我幽家，而保我民族。語曰，風動草偃，又曰有聞必先。自來實行之功，有資衆力；而倡導之責，實在地方英　秀出人士。吾人今日如不及時奮發，躬行實踐，以盡瘁鄉里者，竭盡吾捍衞國家民族之責任，保守我組先辛苦　造之遺產遺業，則必至坐視我世世子孫，遭人宰割，受人奴僕，不忠不孝，不特無顏以對吾人之祖先，亦將爲世界人類所鄙棄。主奴榮辱，爭此須臾，此實吾全國同胞，尤其各地賢達之士，所應深切猛省者也。××侵略我國，肆　茶毒，亦已至矣。自東北　省，以至華北華中華南各地，凡××鋒刀所至，莫不××××焚燒，刦奪貨財，施行毒化，毀滅生產。跡其昭　之禍心，不惟欲覆亡我國家。實欲消滅我種族。所幸抗戰以來，賴我全國軍民，深明忠孝之大義，誓興暴×作殊死之周旋；或爭先荷戈，捐糜血肉於前方；或輸財助餉，毀家紓難而不惜；更或竭盡勞力，躬冒艱苦，以從事於生產之增加，而彌補戰爭期中之損失與破壞。是用衆志成　，不撓不屈，艱苦奮鬥。我國抗戰，迄今　十九月，×兵之侵入雖深，而其陷入泥潭，進退維谷之苦境亦愈甚。×國今日國際形勢日劣，國力已羅　將窮舉　皇皇，充滿日暮途蹙，終必崩潰之恐怖現象，一切戰局，先後演變，情勢皆恰如吾人最初之預料，最後勝利之目標，已　吾人日趨接近。然就另一方面言，正唯×人自知已瀕於危殆，其必傾其餘力，以圖一過，又爲必然之事理。凡我吋胞，此時苟稍　懈，則不特前功盡　，而敗亡之慘，即迫於麗　。荀能洞見其危難，根　有加，憑藉我地廣民衆之天賦，以努力充實人力物力之補給，則克服×，完成國家民族之復興大業，亦可　足而　。此誠我全國上下，尤其地方賢達，及時効命之秋，抑亦我國家千秋萬世之運命所繫也。關於充實人力物力，增强抗戰力　之道，中央及地方各級政府，固當加緊舉辦，迅速推進。本委員長尤　我全國各地富有知識才能及素負地方德望之士紳賢達與敎育界人士，各　鄕邦，盡力服務，躬爲倡導，以　政令之不及，以促事功之速成。舉，要端，有如下列：第一。應協助政府，推行　役，以充實抗戰急需之兵員。一方將××殘暴事實及抗戰成敗利害，與兵役實施關係，儘量宣傳，以激發民衆抗×意識，促其踴躍應徵。一方對舉行抽籤，懲罰逃役，獎勵投効，及安總出征家屬等事，尤應以地方之力，自動多方協助，務使民衆樂於從戎，安心赴戰。同時地方士紳自身之及齡子弟，更應不待中籤與否，率先親送應徵人伍，或遣送投考各種軍官學校。藉以倡　風聲，民衆自必相學景從。則前方鬥士如雲，勝利益有把握，而且徵兵制度　立之後，募兵隨廢，建國安民，永資利賴，功在國家、更無旣極，固不僅子弟　，　　名垂史冊，克盡忠孝之義已也。第二，應積極開發地方經濟，以充實長期抗戰之　源。現代戰爭完全爲人力物力之總决賽，况現時我國內若干重要都市之被佔，及對外交通海口之被阻，工商機構受盡摧殘，一切物力都艱於供給；而向來在外就業工商之民衆，又多因戰　關係，結束其專業，以返歸於鄕里。基於此種事實，吾人正應乘此時機，矯正過去專力都市建設之誤，以有計劃的，有組織的，開發內地經濟之確設。一方維　抗戰軍需之供給，一方確立民生日用物品自給自足之基礎。舉凡開　荒地，造林牧畜，以　加　　村生　；增加原料產　如何因地制宜。集資集力，分工合作，均望我各地賢　，悉心購求，分頭念進，政吩必當盡力扶助，特別維　。尤其對於各屬小規模手工業，我國向　發達，取材最便，爲用最廣，　效最易，更應由地方士紳充分利用原有基礎，予以扶助，威接濟其資本，或擴充其生產，或改良　方法，或唯廣其銷路，凡屬有裨實用，利及民生，與足　補助戰時需要之品，胥應各盡其實力以赴。本委員長嘗調抗戰勝利之　澈，必從做到無「慶人一『廢物」一廢堆』一廢時』四者以求之，而所以達到摒絕此四「　」之目的，又必　開發地方經濟。增加農業生產，及積極扶助手工業入手，深信以我國物產之當，人力之盛，果能組織精密，運用雖活，則就經濟持久一端，卽足制×　之死命。凡上二者，皆我抗戰總動員要項中最簡捷易行之事，亦　我抗戰軍事兵力財力之所由資沿，夫自×人自前年作戰以來。　兵役之徵發，已再三降格，今則不合規定　格，人民。亦已强迫應徵，其戰時公債之發行，都後總數已達九十萬萬日元　右，而其臨時種種誅求及節約獻金等，則　不與焉。彼我相　，我國民之所負擔。與所盡義務，相差實甚。何况吾人爲被侵略之國，正當呼吸存亡之間，政　所　望於我全國同胞之努力者。顧猶若是其平易。倘負有領導民衆責任之地方賢達，而不能躬爲　率，或不能善盡其責　者，當非我秉有數千年忠孝道德薰陶者之所肯出也。抑有進者，我數白萬將士正浴血殺×於疆場，數千萬淪陷區域之同胞，正在遭受暴×之摧殘，作　危之　鬥。凡　同胞，尤應本精神動員，再援再萬，生活共同甘苦，以示前方後方同仇×愾之决心。舉凡禁絕者博。剷除煙毒、取締淫廳，矯正塌諸端，各地七紳及敎育界人士，務宜以身作則，極力提倡，並協助政府切實推行，直接轉移地方之風氣，間接則　影響後方之實力。古今中外，未有風俗浮佚腐敗，而可致國家於富强隆盛者，而世運風俗之轉移，亦未有不賴少　蓄德扑道之君子，以爲之倡導鼓盪及成者。本委員長忝承同胞付託之重，主持抗戰全局之責，惟日孜孜，以赴抗戰必勝建國必成之鵠的，精神心志，無時不與我全　賢達相感通。誠以此艱鉅使命之完成，决非一手一足之所克致，必賴我全國　達，一心一德。各在地方努力，使人盡其才，物盡其用。而後乃能收穫衆擎易舉之功，深信我全國賢　，當必能各抒出誠，盡共當盡之責，　其未發之力，以副拳拳屬望之意也。至若地方利弊，民生疾苦，我各地賢達，本其服務經驗之所得但期裨於事實，儘可據實直陳，必當傾誠採納，資爲討究。書不盡言，惟　及時努力，以竟持久抗戰，克×致勝之功，而送成吾人自救救國之任務，國案民族？責利賴之，蔣　正皓（十九日）</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　白雲　（續完）</p>
<p>一般人頗慮冬日黄河結冰後，人渡　犯陝，這是一種過慮，因黄河冬日結冰，祗在河曲縣的上游，晋西北和綏南，才有這種危險。河曲以下，特別是禹門口以下，水流湍急，向少結冰。據潼嗣一老翁言，就彼，生記憶所及，風陵渡河水冰，僅有過兩次，一次在光續一十七年，一次在民國十八年，冰上可行車馬，但這兩次都是天降二三尺厚的大書，氣候寒冷異常。普通寒天，絕對　會結冰。就今年的氣候言，更不會結冰，現時大凌塊不斷下瀉，×人偷渡更不方便。</p>
<p>保衞西北，自然以關中的河防最關重要。因綏南渡河後，地多沙漢，不易行軍，陝北和豫西渡河後，多山地，行軍更難，故河防較易，×人進攻西北旣圾　視西安，當然關中河防比較重要，這一段河防，句括韓城陽半民朝邑，潼關儲縣，這些地方中尤以平民與潼關左右的河防爲重要。因韓域陽河岸均爲懸崖、若安置精說砲兵部和相當隊，較易防守。平民縣至潼關附近的三河口，均　平坦的河灘，寬處達四五里，且永濟縣被×人佔領，大　關和平民縣朝邑縣。均在×砲控制，下，若×由韓踢鎭（永　之南）放船渡河，正可順流而至平民縣的富民村登岸，登岸後一向西北數里，即爲朝邑縣，若我們不能　滅×人子河灘，則朝邑與大荔，均不可守。大荔爲潼關內渭河以北的軍事重鎭，×必由　西犯三原等處，拊曲安之背，以策應由隴海綫攻潼關西犯西安正面之×。故　中河防，以　民爲最重要，潼關形勢險要，×不易渡河。</p>
<p>我們最近在韓城全潼關一帶的河防，已增加大批極精銳的部隊，且有機械化部隊。朝邑一帶的部隊特別多，黄河以內百餘里中均駐重兵，關內的渭　洛河水陸交通聯絡已完成，數千民衆，每日不斷的在部隊指揮之下，做河防工　，故河防極爲鞏固，後方大可安心。</p>
<p>政府對於保衛西北的準備，已在積極進行中。不但增加河防兵力，且向山西增兵。所望於後方者，要乘此戰事沉寂時期。加緊動員民衆及一切抗×準備，切勿因西北上的暫時安定，而　懈起來。西化外綫抗戰之能否勝利，河防之能否鞏固，不能專賴軍事，必須把整個西北的政治和民衆動員，以西安爲中心，而與軍事配合起來，完成保衛西北的任務，才有切實保障。</p>
<p>七、　潼關的現狀</p>
<p>假使我們能收復永濟，則風陸渡韓湯鎭一帶之×，自然不能立足，潼　亦自然安定。否則，潼關乎民朝邑一帶，將經常的在隔岸×人砲兵的控制之下，雖×人不渡河，也難安定，潼關的　海綫交通，更不能恢復。</p>
<p>風陵渡的×人，數月來不時的砲擊潼關，這並不是　圖渡河，而是破壞我隴海綫交通，並燬壞我潼關要塞，破壞隴海綫交通的目的，爲停滯我東西軍事運輸　　我向晋南之增兵及接濟。潼關南門內水　有一鐵橋，×砲即以此爲目標，而集中火力轟擊，當未擊斷時，每十餘秒鐘發一砲，擊斷此橋，×人消耗了一二百砲彈，代價不爲不小。橋斷後，阻我修復，仍不時發砲，但我終以特殊方法，將橋修復，×砲擊失了效力。然爲防我通車計，還是每日夜不時砲擊。我們的特殊運　率，雖仍可通行，爲旅客的安全計，客車朋分段在關內外開行。中間一段數十里，以公路爲聯絡，敏捷穩安，交通如常，×計已窮。本來我們的河防，也有精銳砲兵，且我砲兵陣地，較對岸×之砲兵陣地爲髙，極易　現×人砲位而予以消滅，但我們爲了節省寶貴的砲彈，决不虛發，每　必中，打燬×砲，在數　以來已達數十門。現在隴海路的交通，旣已不怕×人砲擊，我們也就任其日夜去放，專家就×人所發未炸之砲彈佔計（昭和十三年造）。每彈値二三百元，×人這種「自我消　戰」，於我有利，自然砲擊愈多態妙。潼關城內因被×機不斷轟炸與迫擊砲不斷射擊，民衆已疏散殆盡，原有居民及商　二萬五千餘人，現僅餘無法離城生活的貧苦人民四五百人，房屋則被炸燬與震倒者，已達十分之七八，除軍警機關照常駐防外，其餘　關均已遷地辦公，故潼關現已成一純粹的要塞，防務更加鞏固，×人動搖我軍民的陰謀，毫無作用。望我方民衆絕對不要內潼關經常的砲聲而發生疑慮，那正等於×人促我們加緊抗戰的警鐘，潼關四鄕的民衆每日在這種警鐘的響聲之下，加緊的動員，壯丁所組成的河防隊，每日夜都協助軍隊防河，後方更應鎭靜。（一月八日於西安）</p>

<p>今年四月初，鐵衛團用柏林所供給的軍械在羅京密謀起事，事機不密爲政　破獲。結果苛得利奴被捕，同謀犯盎通萊斯科將軍被處流刑。據搜獲的文件証明，他們想在政變以後，濟除一切反對派。卡羅函對於此案並未軍視，後來鐵衛團自動宣布解散，當局對于首要也木加深究，卡羅爾想與他們妥協而把該團收爲已用，所以現在政府中間還有許多是鐵衛圑份子，例如少數民挨委員特辣谷魔和宣傳部長鐵强奴等。此案發生之後，卡羅爾同時也就借此藉口，雷厲風行地排除異已，查封了許多政黨。一一。全國農民黨</p>
<p>全國農民黨是羅馬尼亞最大的資產階級民主政寫。在農民和城市中下階層都很有些羣衆基礎。他們主張擁　憲法，聯合英法及巴爾幹各國，幷反對德意路綫。領袖是孟紐，在一力三七年十一月議會改選之前，共產黨鑒於法西斯蒂反動勢力非常猖獗，向國內民主政黨提議要求組織反法西斯蒂的統一戰線。結果因爲資產階級政黨固執成見，未肯聯合。孟紐氏文質彬彬地和鐵衛團約法三章，說好各不侵犯。結果慘敗。後來在戈格內閣下台之後，方才感覺需要組織民主統一戰線，去與法西斯蒂對抗。不過富時卡羅爾已决心實行君主獨裁，連一切憲政形式也都被取銷，而且禁正政黨活動，憲法內規定的權利，已被根本推翻。</p>

<p>一，少數民族問題</p>
<p>洲的民族原來很複雜，十五個國家中都有所謂少數民族。人口總數運三千萬人。偏狹的民族主義决不能調整這個問題。有人說這是凡爾賽和約所造成的罪惡。其實未必盡然，大戰以前，受異挨統治的少數民族，人口總數更多，約有一萬萬人左右。戰後已經減小很多了。不過沒有根本調整罷了。目前波蘭的少數民族最多。人口統數在八百寫以上。其次是捷克，原有四百多萬人。如果把西班牙的四百萬加泰隆人和一百萬巴斯克人，也算是少數民族，西班牙就占第二位。南斯拉夫所統治的少數民族達二百多萬，其中包括日耳曼人，瑪格亞人，維馬尼亞人和阿爾巴尼亞人。意大利有一百多萬，拉多維亞有五十萬人。匈牙利約八十萬人。羅馬尼亞的少數民族人口總數達四百多萬，句括俄羅斯，烏克蘭。日爾曼，猶太，波　　格亞，布加利亞，南斯拉夫等各種民族，戰後她從奧匈帝國分得很多領土（一）阿地爾（二）布科維那。可是羅馬尼亞人在前者的人口所佔的百分比率只有百分之五十九，在後者佔百分，卅四。</p>

<p>蔣委員長十九日電全國各地七紳及敎育界。希望各在鄕邦對於推行兵役及開發地方經濟諸事，請爲倡導。以輔政令之不足，以促事功之速成，全文語重心長，愷切明曉，凡我愛護鄉邦祖國之七，讀之當未有不躍然　與也—凡我不甘放任田園廬舍，爲××蹂躪刦奮者，自應毅然决然，遵奉勸請，率其不弟，爲國干城，輸其資財，輔助建設。且十紳　政府民衆之間，最適於宣傅政府政策與法令，表達民衆疾苦與要求，十紳領導之可」，當亦在此。猶應注意者，（一）十紳領導與封建風習守舊思想不並存。故蔣委員長電文中所舉『以身作則』「倡樹風聲』等語，不能輕輕看過：對於一切陳腐風習，守舊思想，門戶成見，當極力排斥。（二）領導與包辦不相容，故各地十紳，尤應了解蔣委員要電文中『必使人盡其才，牧盡其用，而後乃能收穫衆擎易舉之功』一語之至意，凡于民衆中有威信及具有動員民衆經驗與專門技能者，必須不分派系，冺除成見，力予掖引，俾爲國用，夫能如此，始不負要最髙領袖諄諄之至意。</p>
<h3 id="c31">游撃幹部訓練班 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>據傳中央最髙當局爲擴大游擊戰果，决先在某處設立游擊幹部訓練班，任湯恩伯及葉劍英負責主持，可見第二期抗戰中『游擊戰軍於陣地戰』的抗戰綱領，已將逐步實施，現在西北戰局果將日　嚴重，西南戰事又已轉趨劇烈，而我們所賴以爭取二期抗戰勝利的×後游擊戰爭，迄今尙未普遍發展，其間幹部缺乏，亦爲重要原因。今得威信經騐素著的湯葉二將軍率先奉令訓練幹部，深信對於抗戰，必有軍要助益。不過就目前局勢而觀，則此種幹部訓練，實應擴大爲全國規模；始能滿足各戰區迫急需要。此外如西北方面原有此種幹部訓練學校，但因種種關係，致使業經訓練的幹部，不克分赴各地爲國効勞，而前往就學靑年，亦多受阻難或遭拘捕，此種現象，經過此次五中全會、希望可以不再存在。</p>
<h3 id="c32">滬海關被處經過 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— （本報上海特約通訊）　致平</p>
<p>談判之起因</p>
<p>自八一三滬戰發生後。日輪之進出楊樹浦虹口區者，恃其武力，一律拒絕海關撿查：同時日貨乃利用其無稅之便利，大量傾銷於滬市，迨我軍西撤後，不肖商人，與日商朋比爲奸，私貨之輸入更湧。二十七年度最初四月中，據日方報吿，月方之連絡船來滬奢共十三次。其他船　共十五次，運來貨物總量五萬四千餘噸。大宗私貨爲人造絲·糖，疋頭，黄豆，豆油，捲烟紙，海味等項，影響海關我收，實甚浩大。</p>
<p>戰事以前，滬海關稅佔全國首位，暢吒時每月逹二千萬元，斯時竟降至每月約四百萬元，以海關稅收爲担保之各項外債執券人，至此自不無惴惴。日人乃以恢復海關權爲餌，誘致英人與其舉行談判，要挾滬海關接受僞組織所訂之新稅率。</p>
<p>談刺自二十七年二月起郎已開始，由駐日英大使與日外次進行交涉，最初深慮外界聞知，至五月談判結束，竟宣布新稅率自六月一日起正式實行，于是此一齣×××××××××於焉吿成。</p>
<p>協定之內容</p>
<p>五月三日，英日雙方，同時公佈關於上海海關談判公報，文甚簡略，只規定勘後上海海關稅收，除撥付外價本息外，部欵改存横濱正金銀行，他述及。推隨協定成立後事實上所表現者，爲南京組織竟委派僞員爲滬關監督，滬東區海關　私工作雖恢復。但所派關員均限日籍或西籍人員，尤堪注意者。爲新稅則實行，免除海關附家稅，另徵賑災附加稅，仍爲百分之五，進口貨之减稅者，計有棉布，棉紗，棉花，棉織品，毛織品，人造絲，海產，糖，汽油，水泥，雜貨等項，對于日貨輪入，更加有利。此外出口貨中，棉花鑛產二項。係製造軍火原料，竟得全部免稅焉。</p>
<p>茲錄戰英日對於上海海關談判之公報原文如下：</p>
<p>『本年（一九三八年）二月起，駐日英大使與日外次，卽進行關於償還以中國開稅爲抵各外債與其他運帶事件之非正式判談，因交換意見之結果，日政府已將其所擬戰時調整此事之暫時辦法通知　政府，英政盼于復文中向日本聲明。英國對此戰時暫行辦法之施行無所反對，並聞美法二國亦不擬提出任何反對，如經濟狀况發生驟愛，則此辦　得重行考慮之，凡在日軍佔領區內各口岸海關所收入之稅項，槪將存於橋濱正金銀行，由此存欵內將應償外偵之　發交總稅務司，以完全履行以關稅爲抵的外債與賠款之義務，此項外債與賠欵之　付，須親爲關稅於扣除海關行政經費及若干海關支付與津貼後之第一項開支，每一口岸應付外債之額，每月照攤該口岸在上月各口岸稅收總數中所占之成數而决定之，匯豐銀行去年九月起，所存日本應得之庚子賠欵將設法付與日政府，此外並將設法以履行庚于賠欵與一九一三年善後借欵中日本所應得部份之將來償付，並付還本年二月起，總稅務司在上海匯豐銀行所積存之上海抵付外債項下透支之數，及將日軍佔領下各口岸匯豐銀行關稅項下之餘數，移交横濱正金銀行，用以將來抵付外債。</p>
<p>各方對此之反響</p>
<p>一，海關華員一度怠工上海海關全體華員，於聞悉僞紐織任命員爲關監督後羣情　激，於五月七日晨實行怠工，並舉行全體會議，議决五項：（一）請稅務司羅福德及華副稅務司裘其偉到塲說明經過。（二）推代表成立上海海關華員護關會，以保護海關主權完整爲宗旨。（二）推派執行委員三十五人組織執委會。（四一）電中央說明目前環境，以海上情形一，並請孔部長明示辦法。（五）未得切實辦法前，堅决實行怠工。</p>
<p>五項議决通過後，髙級關員認爲事態重大，乃出席致訓，竭力動導，認海關爲政府機關，關系航商頗具，在海關服務人員未獲政府命令，不得搶斷職守，況外傳種種，均非辜實（？）不應有所舉動，免致各方遭受影響，而爲他人截口云云。</p>
<p>風潮發生時。又有關員被綁架事，　經交涉　出，亦有調派至粵海關服務，一場波浪，於是遂告無事矣。</p>
<p>二、我政府之抗議　海關談判協定消息傳出後，我駐英大使首向應政府提出二點，加以反對，（一）英國承認日本支配華北八口岸之關稅。（二）協定中央有償還內債之規定。及協定公報露布後，我政府又以牒文送交英外部，生明中國絕不受英日所訂辦法之束縛，保留中國在其海關事件上行動之完全權利與自由，並指斥兩個外國未得中國同意擅自對於中國海關締結協定之舉動。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>我們假如不是健忘的，總會記得繁華綺麗的上海甫吿淪陷。何香凝先生在四婦女會第一次聯席會議上的一個献議——籌辦婦女難民習藝所。當時這一提議是獲得熱烈的擁護的。時候過得眞够快，現在差不多一年了，在一年後的今天，終於由參政昌王立明女士，結合一班熱心的土女、在艱難困苦中創辦了難民工業社。雖然規模並不怎樣宏大，但這不能不算是香港婦女界一個光榮的創作，它將來的發展，是可以預期的。跑在這裏，記者便將巡視這個難民工業社所得的印象，約略記下：</p>
<p>穿過帆檣林立，綠波　漾的三角碼頭，隨着電車路軌的轉折，踏上一所廳大而新的建築物的樓上，二樓，三樓，一陣陣油灰的氣味，隨着緊促的氣味，　進心窩，纔蹈進四樓的梯口，「赤拆」，「赤拆」，不斷的衣車的聲音，流溢出裏面繁忙而又緊張的情緒。敲着門，一會兒，鬥兒開處，跑出一位穿着藍布長衫的婦人，問明來意，便讓記者入內。縱目一望，左邊寬大的騎樓，擺着一張一張長闊的桌子，四面圍繞着一個一個工作的女孩子，在右面的大廳，陳列着一張寬大的桌子，也是一羣女孩子圍在那裏工作。在每條牆柱後，堆着一架衣車，這不能不佩服佈置渚善於利用地方的聰明呀。</p>
<p>這幾十個嘗遍流亡的痛苦的女兒，或俯首地工作，或一壁談一壁笑地工作，大家總是手不停揮的工作。望見了陌生的客人，各人的臉上，都泛露着　人的紅　，帶着一點點的羞意。和那裏負責指導她們工作的羅巧兒小姐，談起她們的生活情况。聽說每天起床後，便是早　，操完了便開始工作。每天工作八個鐘頭，晚上念書，食飯工作均有時，一切生活，是完全紀律化的。她們循順地在工作，親熱地在愛護，　裏像是一家難民工業社裏的女工，　像是一所優美的學校，和一個歡樂的大家庭。她們內心都在愉快地跳躍，雖然三餐飯菜是那樣的樸素。</p>
<p>她們的工作暫時分着車衣服，顧繡，縫鞋，織絨線衫，和做花五個部門。經過了短時間的指導，她們都能很迅速的工作着。現在每種　成品，差不多都有人定下的了。不過她們雖然是手不停脚不歇地工作着，但每天平均祇賺得三毛錢，和這裏的銷費相比還差　很遠呢，這實在要想一個好的方法的啊！」這位羅小姐透了。氣担心地說。她們那種奪鬥和努力的精神，是非常値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>不過我們感覺到這個難民所設在這個繁盛的地方，是不甚適宜的。最低限度也要負祖一筆昂貴的租　，第二還未能　劃到社作很多本少而利厚的必需品，像肥皂，化裝品，牙刷等等物品。其次對於工作上人力的分配，還有點斟酌的地方，以這樣短少的人數，我們以為不宜於製，幾樣不同物品，最如是把它分作兩個部門，或三個部門就够了。而且工作的階程，也須要分着次序去做，比方做花吧，一人剪紙，一人剪鐵線，一人黏　，如此分工合作，總比較「人獨自製成一朶花的時間來得經　呀，假如人力，物力能够獲得相當改善的時候，相信生產量一定增加，那末，所需費用也一定可以應　裕如的啊！</p>
<p>最後，我們希望難民工業社各位熱心的負責人，繼續着努力，創辦第二第三……的難民工業社，直接救濟那些遇難的女同胞，間接利用生產來建立新的中國。</p>

<p>— 希民</p>
<p>——步行殆達八百里——</p>
<p>第三天淸晨乘車到達淸遠城，因爲恐怕×人萬一又要再沿三水北犯、以致位於其西的四會感受戰爭狀態的威脅、不易通過粵南戰塲西邊的捷徑、當匆匆沿着北江東畔向　會進發前、所經縣城下　街帶原爲商店林立之區、於廣州失陷時被炸殆成平地、聽說洮難的同胞以走避得及、尙不爲慘、對淸四公路的治安問題、曾詢之淸遠縣府敎育科長、承他吿以月來行旅不驚、乃安心猛向西南前進、預算是夜宿於淸四縣境的三坑、雖是短短六十里的路程、以連日不斷勞動、直至薄暮而　、脚已酸痛、足底且起水泡、由挑夫領進那所汚穢不堪客店後、倒下床去、休息了四小時、還不能把精神恢復、在　有狹隘不過的房裏、自念一向體質並不爲弱、突臨比較困苦的生活、卽告不支、這對本人、以至對于事物、確是一種敎訓、</p>
<p>沿淸四必路前進、當然因爲他已破毀了、四號大淸早起程、雖然疲乏不堪、這天還得趕完八十餘里、沿路逆面而來的挑祖者特別多、詢諸挑伕、始悉今天是三坑的墟期、無怪昨夜那裏寄居客店的格外衆多、他並吿我以當×人進佔蘆苞時、四會呈急、這條公路由防軍監督沿路鄉民限於某夜在Ｈ出前數小內按指定地段破壞完竣、表現出民衆的力量、所謂軍民合作、彼此打成一遍、當此嚴重的關頭、實有要求百尺竿頭、再進一步的需要、</p>
<p>四會鄉也被炸的市况蕭瑟、自任意中、住在客店、天甫微亮、侍者即拍房呼醒我了、爲的是恐空襲、因爲連日陰雨、所經各處、迄今還未發現×機、起來不早、假如跟着四髙公路　達西江重鎭肇慶、那會爲×截斷由粵西北用下港澳的捷徑之慮、最低限　减低了若干嚴重性、九日啓程不早、在趕往肇慶的公路上、因爲不勝多天的疲勞、想雇轎子，一天跑完白三十里的路程、然而需費過大、每十里取資毫券二元、不但這段路程破缺之處過多、加上連日下雨、缺口大處不僅繞道轉個大幽子才能繼續前進、且有許多地方還不容乘坐者不跳下來、否則連轎帶人翻一個大金斗、又來一次倒霉、故跑了六十里便宿於髙要第四區縣屬的廣利壉、這是北　在三水與西江匯流往西不遠的一個貨物集散點、雖然此間時聞我那英勇的自衛團戰士時以最堅决的熱血與×火拚、於其東南一帶的機槍聲、炮彈聲、惟居民還是那樣的鎮靜、經商的、來往的、秋收後放牧的、都泰然度其本來的生　、他們雖是如此、　敵騎一日闖進來、又該怎辦、</p>
<p>六日以從廣利可雇小舟逕往肇慶、在舟裏屈坐着、沈音的砲聲續斷敲着耳瞙、沿河的自　團常備隊分作五站盤査、因爲不大嚴格、耗時不多、冬天水落、過肇慶峽時那前些時水漲的水平線還髙刻在離水面丈外、風勢很大、同行的有些暈浪了、舟子苦着面跟我談東說西、他是在廣州陷落前兩天預先划到西江肇府這一隅來的、還說稅警總團在省壇失守後、看見接近戰區各縣市的社會秩序急激地起了變化、於是其間有些臨陣被衝散了的、自然也不免有其他的份子在內、竟對避難的同胞施以搶掠的醜　、有一次那個擅作威風的排長、因　取了一個農民的土烟的小裝的廿包、後被吿發、乃受槍决的處分、從此殺一儆白、添上數月來戰事停頓、騷動流離的悽慘事迹迅速地减少了、</p>
<p>也曾爲×機肆毒的肇慶、亦以多日細雨落個不　、靜寂孤獨地横臥江邊、也看見西往梧州的拖渡冒着烟霧來往、河堤邊的行人擁擠不堪、零食的小販更在那兒一帶興奮地做着生意、生活的威脅叫人們不辭艱險往來此間、又有多少的旅各顫服於死神之前、生卽毫無意義、也得拼命以爭這「生」、七日晨大雨、聽說肇慶至新與縣城還有車輛行駛、果然這段公路完好地引領我們直達目的地、百風的路程、五小時始建，那天趕達未逾午時、欲　向相距六十里的和平壉前進、而和平塘沿公路直到開平縣城還尺有四十里，不過挑夫開價過昂、暫宿新與縣城、這里的商人也跟別處一樣、對於購食宿者者者都以貪婪的目光判別他們的交易對象是否過境之客、用國幣爲交易單位固有取巧之機、素價尤昂、其對農民銀行的中華書局紙幣時多敢於折此値、卽其他國幋亦竟被其折價、殊堪痛恨、十元五元國幣無交易又是麻繁得很、此乃一般好商以其在所營地，稍具金融勢力者賴以圖利之方、而一股勞苦大衆則受書不尠者矣、十一小時的時間、急行軍的步法、一天內趕完了百里多的破壞公路、夜宿蒼城（開平縣城）聽說相去四十五里的赤坎埠有電船直駛澳門、尙有明晨的路程便能把我步行之困結束、晚上又有友人來會，雀躍不已、</p>
<p>八日早飯後、借用友人一輛脚踏軍、滿以爲可以稍經破毀不大的公路便能安抵開乎文物集中的亦坎埠、怎想得到這縣公路雖遲至日來始爲鄉人沿路施以柝掘、他們把路基上的沙土深深地　上兩傍、把康莊平坦的路面擁　得使來往者下得陷阱來又須爬上對邊的土堆去、這似乎是犧牲到底的精神吧？竊以爲軍事上對於將要退出或其他可資敵用的交通建設施以自動破壞、第一需要到了須要加以破毀的軍事境種、就是破壞的方法也有種遇、在此不必添述、當時利用脚踏車代步、固然弄得下不得上不得、滿額是汗、笑倒了沿路爲國作防的　人、咎由自取、不應怨尤、而運行人也多雖能越過了缺處、而洧倒者所見皆是、</p>
<p>赤坎埠至三埠（長沙屬開平、荻海新昌隸台山）的河道淺隘、原日自廣州來往三埠間拖渡不便直駛赤坎　以出、九日到達該埠的明　、有電翰一艘以船身吃水量不多、由此間直駛澳門、餐樓取費五元、大艙四、均牧　幣、搭客並不　擁、本來、搭客和夢者未必能够一帆順風是必然的、果　、船抵中山縣屬　魚沙地方、河狹艇多、電船亦不熊湧過，乃呼所有乘客轉乘駁艇以　、駁艇亦不能前、搭客即從駁艇者勸吿、上岸越過河邊淺狹處、搭客質以是否因而可有辦法繼行、答以駁艇及　船俱無負責人在、唯各方出毫劵三角可附搭其他拖渡至澳、又曰若不然者難免在此候至數天之言爲成赫、搭客又從之，比附乘他渡時、所指定附搭的拖渡的負責人竟又向搭客索賣國幣二元、時適十日晨、×機環飛而上、奸徒欺詐於下、過澳抵港之晨爲十一日、沿黄武鐵路縣份居留者多以赴港只有兩途、一赴汕頭、一赴廣州灣然後轉港、不少不　有此捷徑可通也、</p>

<p>自中日戰事發生以來、全國金融陣綫、始終穩定、經長期之試騐、排多數之難關、而公私金融組織、乃益臻完　、國民之信任、與日供增、今决以其全力開發後方之經濟，使資金流入內　、協助發展、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>今年金融　更見鬆動</p>
<p>中中交農四行就有分支行之重要都市、各　聯合辦事處及貼放委員會、　事農工商業票據之貼現與抵押放欵、此項貼　辦法、半爲商業抵押放欵、而以有轉　與貼現之規　、故又具有中央銀行調　金融之功能、目前貼放在外之欵、約一萬萬元、自實施以來、全國金　、異常安定、去年無提存擠兌風潮、亦無信用緊縮金融恐慌之跡象、今年初、金融情形、更見鬆動、故貼放委員會停止直接放欵、遇有需要、由銀錢業公會代爲申請、</p>
<p>竭力開發　後方經濟</p>
<p>政府爲開發後方經濟起見、一面獎勵生產事業、移入內地、一面復力謀地方金融之流通、自地方金融機關得向中交農四行領用一元劵及輔幣卷、以接濟內地生產事業、其用　係在鼓　金融機關向農工礦方面投資、以矯正往昔偏重都市金融之失、令决（　）鼓動輸出、便利　外華僑匯欵、（二）設法收集金銀、（三）增設地方金融機關、（四）提倡節約運動、（五）鼓勵各項生產、（六）增加農業放欵、（七）供給信用借欵、（八）訓練金融人才、以上各項、均已先後見諸實施、</p>
<p>發行政策　特別謹慎</p>
<p>我國之法幣政策、在戰前已見成功、經戰事而信用益著、法幣現金準備、始終在百分之六十以上、而保證凖備、則在百分之四十以下、歷次檢査、均與法定比例相合、至於發行綫額、民國二十六年終、爲一·六三九·〇九八·〇〇〇元、二十七年六月、增至一·七二六、九九八·〇〇〇、其增加率已不若改革初期之速、蓋自二十四年十二月至二十五年十二月、發行總額共增五六八·九七九·〇〇〇元、而二十七年上半季、則僅八千七百九十萬元之增加、則足證其發行之謹愼、</p>

<p>平安……摩登女探</p>
<p>The　Mad　Miss　Manton</p>
<p>一部融合着羅曼絲和神秘晴殺案、而以諧趣瘋狂的格　演出的影片、白蓓蘭史丹妃飾一壞透了的交際花、無意中發現一尸首、報吿警署、及到偵　　到、死尸已給兇手搬走了、因她平素的品行、人家以爲是她想出風頭而造出的一個謊詁、這分明是寃杜了她、更使地吃不消的還是一個靑年的綱輯（亨利方達師）、在報上對她冷　熱嘲的擊、於是紏台了一班姊　、進行　緝的工作、在發現第二死屍之後、人家才同情　信她、特別是那靑年編緝、給她大大的帮忙、那時候兇手想殺她以　口、虧得警探把兇手圍殲、方得幸免、</p>
<p>片中情節略缺可能性、但因谷演員優秀的演作、　使劇情的開展、自然輕鬆、暗殺案的編排也相當曲折但在片中幷未佔重要之地位、因爲本片藉以引人入勝者、不是緊張嚴重的偵探故事、而是濃厚的喜劇趣味、</p>
<p>東方……白虎魔神</p>
<p>Boo　Loo</p>
<p>雖不能說是組製濫造但也不見得怎樣精彩、不過故事的背景與取材、比之普通的野獸片、較爲新穎不同一點、導演格符雅利　對於野獸片的攝製頗有經驗、本片處理還算可取</p>

<p>【本報特訊】此次麗華盃賽之華聯足球隊人選、竟因　華　育會旗　球員多南遊西貢而實力備受影響、致令本港足球　會中人亦以此而大起定　、山是曾一度選定之華聯陣容、亦不得不全部推翻、而於日前另行改選、在求知內容者乃多視爲怪事也、然苟細考事實、則事本非奇、　在初選時期、球怪李惠堂因足　未愈、曾表示不願　戰、事後足　總會認爲陣容不足以資號召、丹將及南華之不　派數員蹄港効力爲爽約、同時又堅請　堂勉爲其難、必允到時出場助陣、李氏以輕身一出、即司和緩總會對其母會之不滿、卒允効勞、是以有前日全隊另行改　之事也、</p>
<p>情難却　勉強登場</p>
<p>昨偶過李處、順候其足創近况、幷詢以對二次人選、可否滿意、據　、創處本未全愈、幷將榜　相示以爲證、蓋右脛二、左膝一　、均黑瘀木退、幷　此次參戰與否俱有二難、如自惜其軀而始終却情不出、則無以挽總會對南華之感情、出則因足傷水愈、又無球鞋、恐難達平時之賽球水準　、</p>
<p>筆者聞彼無球鞋一語、怪而詢其究竟、則曰、一球鞋之適合與否、於球藝之演出問題實有絕大之影響、固爲過來人如君者之所深知也、我素所慣用之球鞋、適爲劉慶才君所愛而借以爲用、已携往西貢去、新鞋旣非一朝一夕所堪爲用、若求其他用至軟熟台適者又頗難其選、盡我足特長、實不易假借者也、今惟有望以脚大見稱之梁彥贊君之一雙能適用而已」云云</p>
<p>李又言、彼自國際賽受傷後、因養　未霄作任何體育運助、故氣力必不如前、又加以球鞋非已所慣穿者、則演出未敢必其盡如人意、夫賽球勝負至難逆料、到時只有盡　所能以　而已、如表　未能及本人乎時小準、尙望傍觀者體諒、毋過事深　云、</p>
<p>筆者最後詢以對二次選定之實力以爲如何、據云近因事忙、甚少看他隊賽球、故對於後起健者、多不知球藝何才、　旣得谷會遴選者認可錄用、自必有相當球藝、所可慮者、則各員知多未賞與彼合作、到時或有聯絡稍疏？處、他人未敢妄評、惟本人則恐因未得慣於合作者如馮　祥君序在、則甚妨無多射球機會、倘兩內鋒稍能退後常作及時供應之策、則或較易覓隙射門　、</p>
<p>李惠堂　分身泛術</p>
<p>又任昨早足　總會致函於李、請於農曆新春日之港菲埠際賽會中、必出席爲港方　力、同時黄家駿亦敦　其於二月廿六日、必出助　華足球隊義賽港聯，俾增加號　力、聞李氏均已應允到時出塲無誤矣、詎不久又有香港體育界服務團主席陸靄雲轉來周壽臣爵紳交到滬電一通、乃敦促李氏於農曆年晚赴滬出席其處農曆　旦之　濟難民義　者、文云、</p>
<p>周壽臣先生鑒、滬報載李惠堂　　大力敦請來　　參加　賽、至深感佩、</p>
<p>敝曾茲定二月廿日比賽、李君　日起程、盼　、上海國　救濟會李規　、李自接來電後、以滬賽與港　際賽同日舉行、則赴滬之行、實難應命、允尙有二月廿六義　仍須在港出塲、助赴滬之期、非俟二月廿六後無法分身、因　　請周爵紳　　復上海前　、請將　處義賽改在三月四日舉行、俾彼能騰諾卧滬効力、據云滬方一場　改期　行、亦於收人　少影響云、（球場舊侶）</p>

<p>「楊曰予命　亦是獲存，初遼東之破也，恐民貧思亂，先拘貧民殺之，又二年恐民富，聚民致亂，復盡殺之，惟四等人不殺。一等皮公，能爲快鞋，不殺。二等木工，能作器用不殺，三等針工，能縫裘帽不殺，四等優人，能歌漢曲不殺。惟欲殺秀士，時予爲諸生，思得寸進，閉門讀書，面頗肥白，被獲問曰，汝得非秀士乎？對曰非也。優人耳！優人必善歌，汝試歌之，遂唱四平調腔一曲，　得獲擇。</p>
<p>楊述竟卽于筵間親點板歌一闕而罷。」</p>
<p>今日的淪陷土地上的慘情，很少人知道，不渦在八年前所淪陷的東北四省，確已經是演到民分四等的嚴毒地步。所可異者今日東化國士上，不止擊殺秀士階級，甚而至於稍有國家民族思想的工農階級。也不能免。比如說今日日本人在東北，將東北民衆也分劃做四等，曰甲乙丙丁四等。甲等民專指智識分子而言。乙等則爲已投降做奴隸當偽官的中等人土而言，丙等是工人，丁等是無識農人。在這四等之內最危險失却生命保障的算是甲等，不但平時如此，且在戶口簿上出入旅行的行旅証上，這「甲等民」三個字，也都要淸楚地登印上，好作爲嚴防的表號。這正如德國逐出的猶太人的護照上，被簽印着「猶　人」是一樣的。不過「猶太人」三個對字猶太人本身並非侮辱或危害，不過祗是一個令人討厭的記號罷了。但一甲等民」却分明地吿訴說：」這是反日抗滿的思想犯」，遲早生命會被塗抹的。但近來因爲反日意思的普遍，和×人壓迫的加緊，連丙種民，丁等民也多是走入實地抗狄打擊狄人的路上，就如今日在東北各地橫行的東北義勇軍，主要分子都是東北　農工大衆，即是一例。由此可見昔日滿洲的壓迫實不如今日狄人的逼煎的烈毒。</p>
<p>所可異者，遼陽員生楊某，雖然一度深嘗到做亡國奴的苦　，終生痛惡，但到底他依然投到主子的懷抱中，弄上一個總督做。虧是個書生，屬於智識階級的小市民，無論在甚麼時代環境中，都能弄上一官半職，「失節」雖然事大，但「餓死」一事，事也不小，這也是在今日淪陷土地中只見有無知識的粗民揭竿而起，予敵打擊，而少見士人死節，智識份　的捐軀·比如說在東北的廣大倫陷地區中，毀家抗敵的只有趙老太太和他兒子等人，再有就是前時佔山爲寨的「馬胡子」，無知無識的農工，如果有人問；「那些知識份子呢」？這就沒有下文了。也許那些智識子專等待着國軍反攻罷！但他們却都是滿嘴塗油地吃着侵略者賞與的恩筵，做起甚麼指導員或特務　僞國官職了，士人只是士人，在任何社會鄱是如此罷！</p>
<p>就如近日有一般「面目肥白」之士，居然和狄人拉起手來，詆汚政府與抗戰的民衆，這眞是人間的奇醜大辱·假使天無公理，他們的鳥計劃實現的時候，當然他們又是做官居爵了。士人無恥，大抵如此。</p>
<p>亡國的苦，似乎在某一般人的身上，並不有甚麼顯然的苦痛感覺，這一　人確實應該打下永世做亡國奴的十九層地獄，萬世也翻不得身，作爲他們應得的刑罰。</p>
<p>當此「賣國不知羞，漢奸遍地走」的時日，未嘗過亡國奴的苦味的人們，應當警惕了·</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>我在暗暗推想，　成他們　種性格思想的原因，因為不只是于先生父子，所有在場的男人，　他們談起話，全有個和旁處老百姓純粹的頸兒，甚而就是婦女，他們也有她們的見解·這小小的山村，文化　不到，交通不方便，他們怎麽就會多　得許多外邊的事故　警如她們說：</p>
<p>「左近十里地以內的村落，到陜北上學去的年靑人，已經有二十多個」。</p>
<p>爲什麽他們知道大老遠地跑到那邊去，而且眼前年靑人，他不也說就要在短期內動身的麽？有一種這麽力量推動着他們呢？還有一個婦人，兩房守着一個兒子，也放那孩子去了·她談　話一點也不像普通婦人那樣擦眼抹淚，反而在他的臉上浮露着笑容，彷彿那事情使她光榮—這又是由於什麽原故？</p>
<p>望望近處的田野，望望　處的高山，我真苦於不能自解了。在煩悶中不知怎樣說了一句：「這一帶眞是打游　的地方·」說完我還指指東邊那座聳立着的大山·</p>
<p>「那山下，就是林家大灣，林彪的老家啊！」人們不約而同地說道，看他們那模子，與奮了的不得，「抗日大學就是他當校長！」</p>
<p>而這時，于先生以一個先導的身位，伸手指示那一帶山崗，畫了個半弧形，然後，在解　着說；</p>
<p>「那一帶，就是當年紅軍出沒的地方啊，怎麽不是打游擊的好地方！」他笑了，「現在，我們老百姓也可以跟你們當兵的談這些話，從前啊，不行啊。」</p>
<p>這一來，我把這小村的人們完全認識過來。影響啊，影響啊，全然是由於那方面影響了他們的原故。據他們說，紅軍首經下山出擊，佔過兩次村壯，他們積好幾年的經驗，對紅軍方面也就有了新的認識·　（未完）</p>

<p>— 杜文慧</p>
<p>初冬的深夜，黑黝黝的天空還因耀着無數的繁星。我們九一三團部一千多　弟兄已經開拔　廣增公路的中段——龍眼洞附近的村落，趕去駐紥了。</p>
<p>在這半夜匆忙的行軍中已使隊伍感到異樣地疲乏。先頭部隊已在九十里外的增城接觸了。深沉的炮聲不斷從夜空中飄蕩過來，我們每個心兒都在不斷的跳動着，又爲那不可預知的死亡命運所騷擾着。即使渴睡的眼睛已經合上了；可是我們還是尖着耳朶，靜聽着夜空有什麽動靜，如果　而有一兩聲狗吠或一些脚步的聲音　，我們就會不安地張開眼皮，爬起來向營外張望着。</p>
<p>天還未發亮，　色的空際正　出一線曙光。我們正夢中酣睡的時候：突然在空際發現一陣×機軋軋的聲音。我們慌忙爬起來穿了衣服。　出村外的田野和山裏去躱避着。</p>
<p>「隆隆隆……的爆炸聲開始　徹　大地空間和人們的心竅。炸彈在薄暗的晨晞中像一籮籮黑鷄蛋似的倒下來。整個村落，公路的叢林却變或了一片灰燼，都冒出衝大的火焰！</p>
<p>彈不但要炸平那些村落，並且要炸平那公路傍邊的山林。</p>
<p>「閣閣閣……」的機關槍聲向着我們四週掃射着。我們十多個人向那邊的山峯拚命的爬上去，當我們爬到那山巔時，只剩下我和四個士兵，一位姓陳的服挽員。</p>
<p>我回頭一望，看見在那公路的遠方，已經有十幾輛黑坦克車衝過來，它好像如入無人之境。</p>
<p>飛機是在頭頂上掃着機關槍，子彈從我們身上左右的風舞　。我們拚命的跑下山坡，又再跑過過另一個山。這當兒我只知道生命，不管前面荆棘還是淺坑，見路便走，見山便爬。跑了兩個多鐘頭纔聽不到那機關槍聲，也不見那敵機的影子了。</p>
<p>這吋候天色已發亮了。彩紅的陽光已照在我們的背上，照在憔悴的山谷，照在那迷茫的空際，冬日的晨光是　愛的明朗，可愛的溫暖，我們六個人坐在一塊樹林裏的石上休息着。每個人的腿都發腫了。心兒像熱鍋上的蜩蟻那麽不停的跳動着。在這整夜的逃亡中已使我們的臉蒼白了。每個人都不願講話，只有深心裏交響着一些悲痛的激流，疲憊地仰在那叢林中睡着了。</p>
<p>林間的小鳥，在剝落的枯枝上唧唧啁啁地唱着可愛的小曲，好像是慰藉我們這羣逃亡的人們的辛酸。</p>
<p>當我們從酣夢中醒來時，太陽已落到西方了。一片夕陽的金黃，正軟洋洋地躺在這綠林裏·　時候覺得很飢餓了。然而在這野外孤林去那兒找一點食物呢？於是我們再决定向着廣州前進了</p>
<p>當我們將近走到河南的地界，已是傍晚的時候了。遙望廣州和河南那邊冒着衝天的火焰，黑白的煙霧正彌漫了整個空間。我們知道×軍已進了廣州了·如果再向前進那一定會遭遇危險的。在沒有辦法的當中我們只有忍餓跑到佛山去。</p>
<p>我們把槍枝完全拋在　野外。在黑夜中從小港一直跑到佛山，一夜不斷的跑步，終於在東方發白時抵達佛山了。我們幾個人租了一個房間，在鎮上吃了早飯便跑回客店去睡覺了。在這天晚上那四個士兵便分手回家鄕去了。祗有我和陳服務員留在那兒。</p>
<p>翌晨。我和陳服務員便動身離開佛山到澳門去。當我們從佛山到官山的路上，有幾個執着手槍的土匪把我們搶劫。我們的錢都給搜去了。僥倖我鞋　的五塊大洋沒給搜去，否則我們使要餓斃途上了。</p>
<p>經過幾許辛苦。幾許困難，我們終於到達澳門，找着一位親屬借了二十塊錢纔逃回香港來。</p>
<p>在這十幾天的流離飢餓的逃亡生活中，是我生命史上最難忘的一頁，×人那殘酷的行爲，是我永遠不會遺忘的！總有一天，我要誓報此仇！</p>

<p>— 竟成</p>
<p>在漢好報紙上，不斷地宣傳着無恥的與無稽的「反共理論」——這是漢奸及其主子們最自鳴得意的掩眼法，這種　眼法，當然瞞不過有了十八個月抗戰經驗的中國人民———在這江湖上混大了的好漢的。然而也還有一些上了當的獃瓜，居然着了魔似的跟着妖怪講夢話，說了一大堆「解散共產黨，取消邊區，改編第八路軍，新四軍」等等不倫不類的話。這完全是中漢奸的反間計的。他們一點也沒有看看，十八個月來，共產黨的存在，陜甘寧邊察和冀晉邊區的存在，第八路軍的存在，究竟帮助了抗日戰爭，還是妨碍了抗日戰爭？幾十萬共產黨員在×人後方，從事最艱苦的抗日活動，幾十萬武裝在第八路軍新四軍的幹部領導之下，牽制着×人幾十萬的兵力，堅守着在×人後方的根據地不退，在邊區行政工作中，無論是民主制度的普遍與提高，民衆抗日敎育的實施，武裝民衆，動員民衆等工作，都在國內起了模範的推動作用，只有盲子聾子才不曉得有這樣的鐵的事實，這　事實。難道就可以作爲須要解散及取消這些組織的理由？就是日本軍閥也不能不承認這些組織的存在，是對他們最大的威脅，我們爲什麽要替×人解除這些威脅呢？我眞不明白，這些人爲什麽總是有這樣的閒工夫，怪心腸，來計算這毫無意義的陳年舊賬？</p>
<p>然而那些事情始終是最容易辨別的，漢奸的反宣傳是不能長久欺騙任何人的，要是還不相信，那麼請看前幾天報上同時登載的兩段不同的消息：正當第八路軍的副總指揮彭德懷謁蔣委員長請示，遄回山西前綫，參加山西軍民祝捷大會的時候，而以反共號召新漢奸却在秘密接見日本代表呢。</p>
<p>在這種變化多端，虛僞百出的年頭］還是小心一點：多認淸事實］少相信謠言；且不說什麽政治遠見，總之，這也是做人的本份。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rapid Expansion of Our Nation's Air Force <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, our nation's air force has successively departed for various war zones to bomb × positions. Especially in the South China region, foreign telegrams have repeatedly reported the heroic attacks by our air force. At the same time, news of expanding the air force has also been widely discussed. Looking ahead to the future of the second phase of the War of Resistance, it fills one with infinite excitement and anticipation. Our nation's air force, although only having a short history of a few years, has fully demonstrated its power in the War of Resistance: not only bombing × military positions, achieving great merit, but also performing the feat of showing strength abroad. Recently, taking advantage of the invading × army's stubborn resistance in Guangdong, they have been active everywhere, sinking two × warships in the lower reaches of the Pearl River. The reason why our nation's air force has been able to achieve such great accomplishments and fulfill its responsibility of defending the country with glory is truly due to the central government and Chairman Chiang's efforts to promote it and the enthusiastic contributions of all the people.</p>
<p>The × army's invasion of our country not only uses the air force as an auxiliary force but even uses it to solve some important strategic problems. They often launch large-scale attacks on any location in our country. Recently, as our War of Resistance entered its second phase and a full-scale war unfolded, all routes of the × army were restrained and at a loss; therefore, they dispatched large numbers of air forces to indiscriminately bomb our undefended areas, killing large numbers of civilians, in an attempt to break the will of our people to resist. However, this kind of intimidation not only had no effect but instead made our people's understanding even clearer and their will to resist even stronger. At the same time, it further angered the air force warriors of friendly nations, who, unable to bear witnessing such inhumane attacks, voluntarily came to our country to join the air force and fight against Japan. It is recently reported that five hundred foreign pilots have secretly arrived in China to participate in the war. This is very worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The air force is a force of attack. As our War of Resistance enters its second phase, the strategy changes from passive to active, and the time for a full-scale counter-offensive is approaching. In order to strike at the × army's rear, disrupt the × army's transportation and communication, weaken the × army's strength, increase the × army's difficulties, and even use it to solve some important strategic problems, it is very important to strengthen the air force. Therefore, our country is now actively expanding its air force organization and strengthening its air force strength. In addition to ordering 200 bombers from the American White Branch Aircraft Company, it has also decided to accept the request of foreign pilots to join the air force to fight against Japan, and the new air force will also be formed and put into combat in the near future. This active measure is also very worthy of attention.</p>
<p>However, since the air force is the main force of attack, the consumption rate of aircraft and air force personnel must be very high. To seek the final victory of the War of Resistance, it is necessary to maintain the superiority of the air force. To maintain the superiority of the air force, it is necessary to be able to replenish it quickly at any time. In order to achieve this goal, we put forward the following two points:</p>
<p>First, superior aircraft replenishment depends on industrial and mechanical efficiency. The backwardness of our country's military industry is undeniable. At present, the supply of aircraft still has to rely on foreign countries, which is the most difficult thing during the War of Resistance. Therefore, at present, we must develop the military national defense industry as much as possible, have the determination to expand the aircraft manufacturing industry and implement practical and feasible manufacturing plans. At the same time, we should also develop factories for manufacturing parts and repairing as much as possible so that we can quickly repair damage before we can mass-produce aircraft. Secondly, because aircraft still have to rely on foreign countries at present, a large amount of funds are needed to purchase them from abroad, so our people should continue and expand the donation movement to purchase aircraft, and launch the movement to purchase aircraft with a tax spirit to celebrate birthdays.</p>
<p>Second, the replenishment of outstanding air force personnel depends on active training. In our country, where technology is relatively backward, it is still necessary to hire foreign experts with rich knowledge and experience to serve as training, but warriors tempered from the War of Resistance should also be regarded as training cadres. At the same time, it is best to send a large number of young people to countries with superb aviation technology for further study to improve the training of our country's hole army personnel. It is also necessary to increase the number of aviation schools in the country and cultivate a large number of aviation personnel with a firm determination to resist and a determination to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Although our nation's air force has made great contributions in the past, its future task is even greater. To complete this greater task, our country's authorities must quickly expand and strengthen it.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Week in World Trends From January 14th to 20th, Year 28 <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>Another week has passed amidst the fires of war and the noise of the world. In the Far East and in Western Europe, because of the mad arson of the three fascist aggressor countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, almost the entire world has been set ablaze; and this flame is spreading to the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. But at the same time, the calls and actions of China and Spain, who are steadfastly resisting and bravely putting out the fire, have finally been responded to and aided by countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The successive ultimatums and stern warnings issued by Britain, the United States, and France to Japan are an example. Looking back at our compatriots under the fire of × people's guns, and the people of Japan, Germany, and Italy who are being squeezed by × people, we truly have infinite pain, but seeing the current difficulties and obstacles, and the bright future, we are filled with infinite excitement and infinite anticipation.</p>
<p>A Week in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Japanese invading troops in China have been reorganized for three months, and the commanders-in-chief of North China and Central China have also been changed, but without any achievement. Recently, in order to cooperate with the so-called general offensive of the new Hiranuma cabinet, so as to cheer up the people at home and cover up the failure abroad, they had to launch tentative general offensives in the northwest and southwest. Therefore, in the past week, fierce battles have taken place in all battlefields. First, let's talk about North China. After the failure of the five-way offensive at the beginning of the year, the × army actively reinforced Jinan and northern Henan, and recruited the remaining main force, opening up the Fenxi River along the various roads along the Xiangpu Line to launch a large-scale counter-offensive, attempting to cross the Yellow River by force from Hejin Yumen to threaten Xi'an. The battles have been very fierce in recent days. Fortunately, our army has successively recovered important places in the Lvliang Mountains, and the army that advanced into Lishi Zhongyang Jishan has cut off the × army's intrusion into sections. Now the × army is still preparing to invade westward on a large scale, but our northwest military deployment has been completed. The Eighth Route Army has already penetrated into Rehe, stirring up the flames of war in the rear of the × army, and the guerrilla warfare in the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces has also made progress, apparently isolating the × army that is invading westward. Secondly, the × army in South China has once again launched a fierce offensive north, and the battle in the Conghua Huaxian area is unusually fierce, but the × army has not crossed Taipingchang. In the Xijiang and Nanlu areas, the × army dared not move easily, but both the sea and land routes are actively reinforcing, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. As for the Dongjiang area, our army has been taking the offensive in recent days, and the × army has been forced to retreat and defend. Now, under the active deployment of the Southwest Headquarters, there is no need to worry about the war situation in South China. As for Central China, this week has been relatively quiet. However, the battles in the guerrilla areas on both sides of the Yangtze River have made great progress. Hangzhou has been surrounded by us, and the × army already has the appearance of abandoning its defense. In the vicinity of Suzhou, there have been more than 300 battles of all sizes in the past month, and more than 4,000 × troops have been wiped out. According to General Gu Zhutong of the Third War Area, our army on the eastern battlefield has indeed entered the counter-offensive stage. Looking at the overall situation, although × is eager to move, we have indeed occupied the dominant advantage. In the past week, Japan has wiped out more than 20,000 × troops in Jin and Guangdong alone. Now the entire military deployment has been largely completed; and the widespread establishment of party and government committees in the war zone, the organization of the Guangdong Province War Zone Supervisory Group, the development of the new military industry in the Northwest, and the steady flow of foreign military supplies, and the investment of a large number of military technology experts from the Soviet Union and the United States are all good news that is particularly worth reporting this week.</p>
<p>Major Reforms in Provincial Party and Government Affairs</p>
<p>In coordination with the new development of the military in the War of Resistance, the coordination of party and government affairs and personnel in various provinces also urgently needs to be improved. The reorganization of the governments of Shaanxi and Hunan provinces has been decided by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 17th. In Shaanxi, there have been changes in both military and political affairs. Jiang Qian has taken office as the director of the Northwest Headquarters, and Wei Lihuang and Sun Yunzhong, two soldiers who have repeatedly cooperated with the Eighth Route Army and loyally led the War of Resistance, have been appointed as the commander and deputy commander of the First War Zone, respectively. Jiang Qiwu has been removed from the post of director of the Xi'an Branch and will focus on provincial affairs. As for Xue Yue, who has been appointed as the chairman of Hunan and has been leading the War of Resistance with outstanding performance, it is entirely for the needs of the war. In addition, the governments of the provinces in the war zone are also preparing for reorganization. For example, Li Zongren is about to take charge of Hubei, and Sun Lianzhong is about to take charge of Henan, although this has not been confirmed, but in order to closely coordinate the administration of the provinces with the military in the second phase of the War of Resistance, this kind of preparation is indeed possible and necessary. According to the Chongqing airmail of this newspaper, "The organization of the Party and Government Committee of the War Zone has been expanded. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Kuomintang, will serve as the chairman concurrently, and Li Jishen will serve as the vice chairman. There will be seven to eight committee members, four of whom will be Kuomintang members, and two to three of whom will be Communist Party members. Except for Zhou Enlai, who has been confirmed, the rest of the candidates are still being considered." This is also worth paying great attention to. Because in the past 18 months of the War of Resistance, although there has been unprecedented progress in military and political affairs, this progress is not enough to stop the Japanese from attacking and launch our army's counter-offensive, and the obstacles on the road to progress still exist seriously, especially the lack of consolidation of the anti-Japanese front and the continued development of the phenomenon of party friction. The expanded organization of the Party and Government Committee is the best remedy. On the one hand, it can fundamentally smash the × people's conspiracy to destroy our unity by borrowing slogans such as anti-communism, anti-Eighth Route Army, and anti-border area. On the other hand, it will definitely be of great help to mobilizing the whole people to complete the cause of resisting Japan and building the country. It is hoped that it can quickly become a reality after this Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session Opens!</p>
<p>As the War of Resistance enters a new stage, on the one hand, there are many new progress and successes that are exciting, and on the other hand, there are many new difficulties that need to be solved urgently. The Kuomintang, the largest political party leading the national war of resistance and nation-building, is holding a central plenary session at this time, which is naturally worthy of the attention of both China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, the topics of this plenary session will be: (1) Reaffirm national policies to enhance the strength of the long-term war of resistance. Support Chairman Chiang and government leaders: (2) Strengthen unity, enhance the anti-Japanese front, and concentrate national manpower and material resources to clarify the final victory; (3) Unite all democratic countries that sympathize with China to form an international anti-Japanese front; (4) Establish special agencies to liaise with all parties and factions; (5) Reorganize the "Three People's Principles Youth League" to accommodate the youth of all parties and factions; (6) Strengthen democratic organizations and quickly establish national political councils in provinces, cities, and counties; (7) Improve county administrative organizations: (8) Improve the national conscription system; (9) Thoroughly eliminate traitors; (10) Improve the combat capabilities of the army; (11) Organize student soldiers; (12) Strengthen the political training organization of the army; (13) Improve the material life of the army and promote cooperation between the military and civilians, (14) Implement economic policies and build military industry; (15) Confiscate all traitor property; (16) Encourage the rich to donate; (17) Further reduce the salaries of government officials at all levels; (18) Reduce miscellaneous taxes and increase wartime production; (19) Levy property taxes; (20) Improve people's lives and solve the problem of youth unemployment; (21) Promote thrift movements; (22) Guarantee people's freedom of publication, assembly, and association; (23) Promote mass movements: (24) Implement wartime education to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. These are all the problems that urgently need to be solved at the current stage, and they are also the problems that the people of the whole country jointly demand a fair solution. Even the points raised by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party are mostly included, which is enough to show the true attitude of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. Our people and overseas Chinese all over the country should use all methods to support the Central Committee and support the Fifth Plenary Session to give the most fatal blow to the × people and traitors, and to open up an unprecedented progressive and glorious era for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, and France Jointly Contain Japan</p>
<p>Only by uniting and persisting in the War of Resistance can we win more and greater international assistance, and only by cooperating with more and greater international assistance can we achieve success in our War of Resistance and nation-building ahead of schedule. Now Britain, the United States, and France, like the Soviet Union, have been moved and trusted by our country's unity and War of Resistance, and in order to protect their own interests and world peace, they have begun to take active steps to aid China and contain Japan. Following the United States' tough ultimatum to Japan at the end of last year, the British government also sent a "message that was unprecedentedly tough from the British government after the Sino-Japanese War" to Japan on the 14th of this month, expressing that it would never recognize any situation created by force, firmly oppose Japan's so-called New Order in East Asia, and oppose the destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty; and it more clearly expressed that Britain's Far East policy would stand on the same front as the United States. On the 19th of this month, the French government also sent a similarly tough ultimatum to the Japanese side, taking a consistent attitude with Britain and the United States. As a result, the call for Britain, the United States, and France to jointly implement retaliation against Japan immediately spread from Europe and the United States to Asia and all over the world. The 400 million people seeking freedom were cheered up by it, and the Japanese aggressors could not help but tremble and lose their composure. On the one hand, they instigated domestic newspapers to abuse and rant wildly, severely criticizing the aid of Britain, the United States, and France to our country, expressing infinite resentment; on the other hand, they used diplomatic tactics. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informally issued deceptive remarks that "Japan is preparing to negotiate" in an attempt to ease the anti-Japanese sentiments of various countries. However, in fact, Japan's development in the Far East is obviously incompatible with the ideals of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving and just people in the world. This trick of the Japanese aggressors will ultimately be difficult to succeed. Now let me report a few new facts about international aid to China: (1) On the 11th, the Chongqing National Diplomacy Association received a letter from the World Scholar Squad representative stating that youths from 54 countries are willing to fight to aid China's War of Resistance, and the World Youth Conference has decided to organize two special fighting committees to aid our country; (2) After the establishment of the Sino-US loan, the first batch of military supplies has arrived this week; (3) More than 500 flight personnel from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France have come to China to participate in the War of Resistance; (4) American Fei Wusheng, chairman of the International Relief Association, declared on the 17th that millions of Americans are fighting to aid China's War of Resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Regular Meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<p>The 103rd regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held on the 16th of this month. The main issues of this meeting were, first, the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain, and second, our country's request to sanction Japan. Gu Weijun, our country's representative, delivered a strong speech on the 17th, requesting (1) to implement financial and economic sanctions against Japan, (2) that member states of the League of Nations uniformly boycott all Japanese goods, (3) to ban the transport of raw materials that can be used to manufacture military equipment to Japan, (4) to especially ban the transport of aircraft and gasoline, (5) that member states of the League of Nations provide effective economic assistance to China, (6) to simplify the transportation of military supplies to China, and (7) to establish a special committee in the Administrative Council, with the participation of all countries with interests in the Far East, to consider the methods that member states should take against Japan and to prevent its continued war. Gu also specifically pointed out that other countries' assistance to China in expelling the aggressors is also in their own interests because once China is liberated, it will make a major contribution to world trade. The whole country of China is united, and the military has adopted new strategies, and the future has turned bright; if various countries provide more substantial assistance, then victory is imminent. On the 18th and 19th, the committee composed of representatives from the central government, France, and the Soviet Union held closed-door meetings successively. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Administrative Council convened a secret meeting to discuss the various points applied for by our country. Before Britain and France have fundamentally abandoned their policy of appeasement towards the fascist aggressors, we still cannot have any extravagant hopes for the League of Nations. However, the current international situation has indeed dramatically turned in our favor. We must seize the opportunity and strive for more and greater foreign aid under the principle of self-reliance. The United States has now organized a committee specifically to discuss economic sanctions, which should have a considerable enlightening effect on the countries of the League of Nations. We must more broadly mobilize Chinese and foreign public opinion, launch a global anti-fascist and anti-aggression mass movement, and urge the governments of various countries to effectively implement the policy of uniting and sanctioning the fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>Japan Plots New Conspiracies</p>
<p>As the international situation becomes more and more unfavorable to Japan day by day, Japan has immediately issued peace talks, declaring that it is willing to jointly promote peace with Britain, and expressing to the United States that Japan is willing to negotiate the opening of the Chinese market. The ×× speech delivered by Mitsumasa Yonai, the Japanese ambassador to Britain, at a banquet on the evening of the 18th, is an example. But in reality, the diplomatic policy of the Japanese government has completely become a tool for the fascist warlords to carry out their strategic intentions, and this deceptive trick of Japan has long been seen by the international community. Moreover, the policy guidelines that the Hiranuma cabinet is preparing to announce today (the 20th) clearly stipulate: (1) Japan will resolutely achieve the goals set by this China Incident based on its unchanging policy, (2) Japan suggests creating a New Order in East Asia, which will be practiced along the "Heaven and Earth Avenue", (3) Japan will continue to strike at the anti-Japanese Kuomintang regime, (4) Japan will strive to promote understanding with third countries, (5) Japan's final goal for this Sino-Japanese War lies in the cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China, and the "transformation" of China, (6) Because there are still many obstacles at present, all national resources should be concentrated to achieve this goal. In addition, Hiranuma also plans to ask the Diet to approve his budget案 and other laws. Foreign Minister Arita will also deliver a long diplomatic speech, stating: "(1) Japan's diplomatic policy is in the construction of the 'New Order in East Asia' (2) Third countries have so far failed to understand Japan's true intentions, and Japan will take necessary measures after third countries transport weapons to China through the southwest and other routes to aid China's War of Resistance." More filled with threatening tone. In addition, such as the reorganization of the military, the strengthening of national mobilization agencies, and the plan to greatly expand the army, navy, and air force, all prove Japan's ambition to conquer China and even conquer the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Last Days of the Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>In addition to Japan, the madness of the fascist aggressor nations to prepare to expand the war and the actions of Germany and Italy this week are also very noteworthy. First, let's talk about Germany. On the one hand, it is trying its best to woo Thailand. Goering and Ribbentrop will both go to Poland to carry out activities. On the other hand, it is using Hungary, resulting in the fact that Hungary has withdrawn from the League of Nations and joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. At the same time, the establishment of the German-Turkish lending agreement and the conspiracy to deeply enter the Middle East can be considered to have been initially achieved; therefore, "bomb news" such as attacking the Netherlands and inciting chaos in Ireland has appeared in the newspapers! Secondly, let's talk about Italy. Although this British-Italian Parliament talks failed to achieve the expected success, Chamberlain and Daladier's lack of determination to defend peace by armed force is extremely obvious, so he intensified his steps to attack Spain, attempting to quickly overthrow the Spanish Republican government and establish his military and economic foundation in Spain; on the one hand, he once again launched an anti-French movement, actively increasing troops in North Africa and East Africa, and stepping up military preparations to dominate the Mediterranean Sea. The further aggression of Germany and Italy is not only completely united, but also closely linked with Japan in the East. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has already announced the content of his speech to be delivered today, openly boasting that the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has reached the ideal of the world's anti-communist camp due to the recent addition of Hungary and Romania, and is opposed to countries that advocate maintaining the status quo." However, as the aggressive countries become more rampant, their internal crises have reached a point where they cannot be concealed or salvaged. American journalist Sims publicly revealed in Washington on the 10th of this month that the internal struggle in Germany is becoming more and more serious, and the workers' sabotage and anti-war movements are becoming more and more intense! Japan's economic crisis is even more serious. The main reasons are the lack of materials, the reduction in export quotas, the depletion of gold, the exhaustion of foreign exchange funds, inflation, and the difficult lives of the people. All the Hiranuma cabinet can do about this is to use increased force to extract funds from the people to support the war!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Making Smooth Progress</p>
<p>In this war-torn world, only the Soviet Union, under the leadership of socialism, is victoriously advancing on the road to freedom and happiness. They are determined to uphold the policy of maintaining peace by force and helping oppressed peoples to liberate themselves, and they are fighting unyieldingly. Today, January 21st, in order to commemorate Lenin, the revolutionary leader of the world, they have launched a mass movement on a national scale. They will issue a serious warning to the fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, and at the same time, they will express their highest respect to the 500 million people in China and Spain who are bravely uniting to resist aggression. They have already prepared to use the fact that they are strengthening their naval and air forces as a guarantee for this warning and tribute. The Supreme Soviet has divided the People's Committee of Defense Industry into four committees: aviation, shipbuilding, ammunition, and military equipment. The naval and machinery committees will also strive for development. As of the first day of this year, aircraft production has increased by 15% to 26%. Other defense industries will be developed, and up to 29 people's committees related to national defense will be established. Of the 100 million pounds added to the budget, 400 million will be used to develop military industries. At the same time, they called on the people oppressed by the fascist aggressor nations to unite under the banner of anti-fascism and anti-aggression and work together to stop the new imperialist war. The Soviet Union's experience of reaching the most prosperous, freest, and happiest state today from the most dangerous, most difficult, and most impoverished state in the past 21 years is a good example for our War of Resistance today, and the Soviet Union, which is victoriously advancing today, has united with all the democratic and peace-loving countries in the world to become our friendly army. What reason do we have to be pessimistic and fearful? Let's work hard! Our team is the largest and strongest in the world!</p>
<h3 id="e3">Research on Resistance War Tactics and Important Tasks for Improving Troops (Middle) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>If we want to utilize this tactic to bring out the effectiveness of the War of Resistance, there are still several most important conditions: First, senior commanders must have unwavering determination. If they are determined to attack, they must succeed; if they are determined to defend, they must hold until the last man without retreating. Once the determination is made and the intention is clear, they should not waver due to minor setbacks, nor should they stop halfway. Only in this way can they accomplish the tasks of attack and defense. Recently, I met with officers returning from the front, and they said that the most unfavorable thing in this operation was that our senior commanders lacked determination, or their determination was insufficient. They did not have the true determination to defend places that should be defended, and they wasted many unnecessary sacrifices in places that did not need to be defended! They also said: "When we were ordered to attack, we did not see the determination to conquer, and often we were ordered to stop halfway. When we were ordered to defend, we did not see the intention to defend, and often we were asked to withdraw before we could defend for a while! In fact, as long as our subordinates, the senior commanders, are determined that a certain town must be conquered, or a certain position must be defended to the death, we will do our best to do it until all officers and soldiers are sacrificed! Therefore, in future operations, the overall plan for attack and defense must be decided clearly, and the order must be firm. All places that should be defended should be ordered to be defended to the death. Even if only one person is sacrificed, we must die rather than leave. All places that should be conquered should be ordered to be attacked. Even if the obstacles are extreme, we must attack to the death! Their criticism is very valuable, and all senior commanders must pay special attention to it. In particular, the chiefs of staff and directors of staff offices of all units must pay attention to improving, and must convey these ideas to commanders at all levels and implement them earnestly! In future operations, determination must be firm so that orders can be carried out thoroughly. Only when orders can be carried out thoroughly can victory be assured! (To be continued)</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Guilin, 10th Dispatch] The new army has arrived at the Guangdong border, and the defense of Guangdong Province has become more solid.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Guilin, 19th Dispatch] Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Office, and Huang Xuchu, chairman of Guangdong, were summoned to fly to Chongqing on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 20th] A Chinese military spokesperson said that Japanese warships are slowly sailing up the Xijiang River. At the same time, 2,000 Japanese troops are in Jiujiang, 3,000 are concentrated in Sanshui, and 4,000 are concentrated near Zhaoqing. Therefore, it is predicted that the Japanese army will advance into Heshan. It is also said that the Japanese army that invaded north from Guangzhou launched an offensive towards Conghua this week, but was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreated to its original position in Taipingchang.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] According to the German newspaper "De Chen Xi Bao" yesterday, the French flagship "Ping Jie Hu", which was stationed in Shanghai, suddenly received an urgent order to head south. It is expected to be closely related to the Japanese army's plan to invade Beihai and spy on Hainan. According to news from Annam, the French authorities are paying close attention to the development of the military situation in the Leizhou Peninsula recently and have ordered all navies in the Far East to concentrate in the Gulf of Tonkin. There is also similar news in Hanoi. According to observations from Annam, the Japanese army will land in Beihai within the next two or three days in an attempt to invade Guangxi and cut off the transportation between Annam and Guangxi. At present, the number of Japanese warships surrounding Weizhou Island has increased, and Japanese aircraft have been inspecting the coast of Beihai for days.

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Politician Adachi Gives a Speech. Wantonly Attacks England. <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 19th Foreign Telegraph] Adachi, the president of the "National Alliance Society," a small party in the Japanese House of Representatives, said in a speech at the party's congress today, roughly saying that the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Clark, submitted a note to Foreign Minister Arita on the 14th of this month. Although its content is also related to Japan's China policy, its significance is completely different from the note submitted by the United States. The motivation of the British note is not only to maintain treaty rights, but also to further provide moral assistance to Chairman Chiang. In addition to lending China 10 million pounds, the United Kingdom also supplied 60,000 military fires and military equipment between November and December of last year, which were transported into China via Burma. I am afraid that the country may instigate other countries to jointly impose economic sanctions on Japan, so the people of the whole country must be strictly vigilant. We should strengthen military operations on the one hand to overwhelm the 'Chiang regime' and prepare to deal with the worst changes on the other hand." Adachi also advocated the establishment of a "Continental Affairs Department" in all universities to enable the people to better understand the severity of the current situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] The Japanese-Chinese pro-military mouthpiece "Continental News" published an article today that made a shocking clarification of Japan's Far East policy that has not been made so far. The article said, "We are not surprised by Britain's concern and worry about the situation in China and disagreement with Japan's unilateral modification of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it is what we want. Japan has many representatives, who have been frankly and correctly explaining Japan's policy towards China at home and abroad, giving a major blow to Britain's Far East policy for nearly a hundred years."</p>
<p>[Beiping, 19th Foreign Telegraph] Doiherihara plans to discuss expanding the power of the provisional government joint conference again, but there are no specific measures yet. According to the奸奸, which is close to the Japanese, Doiherihara's current task is to sell "peace" to China. Generally, in the next few months, the Japanese "peace" conditions will be very tempting. In the Chinese newspapers here, there is plenty of evidence of the Japanese urging us to surrender.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] The Central Executive Committee recently ordered party headquarters at all levels that, during the national crisis, all party affairs workers should make double their efforts for the cause. Recently, it has been found that some members of party headquarters at all levels have been appointed but have not asked for a leave of absence or have not taken up their posts, or have made excuses not to go, or have not gone to the party headquarters to work even after taking up their posts. There have also been resolutions to send them to guide in other counties, but they have not been dispatched despite not holding important military and political positions. Such situations are truly unspeakable in the party and hinder the progress of party affairs. Therefore, party headquarters at all levels should investigate and replace them. Those working comrades who leave their posts without following the leave regulations should be severely dealt with by the chairmen of the committees. The order has been distributed to the party headquarters of all provinces and counties for compliance and to instruct their subordinates to follow suit.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Chairman Chiang's Circular Telegram to the Country, Encouraging Local Gentry and Educators. <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Editor's Note: The original telegram was received yesterday morning, but the code was unclear, and there were many omissions (as seen in the newspapers published). In order to be cautious, this newspaper has specially verified and corrected it before publishing it.</p>
<p>To the Provincial Governments of each province. Provincial Party Headquarters, Municipal Governments, Municipal Party Headquarters, and forwarded to the gentry and educators across the country: The War of Resistance has entered its later stages. Success or failure, survival or death, depends on whether we can promote the national righteousness to enrich the strength for long-term combat. It especially depends on the people of prestige in urban and rural areas across the country, who resolutely take saving the nation and seeking survival as their own responsibility. For thousands of years, our country has taken loyalty and filial piety as the foundation of the country. Self-cultivation and helping the world are regarded as the foundation, and it has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Those who agree with it are admired by the world, and those who violate it are despised. This is the special intention of our sages, who have painstakingly promoted it, and has formed a national unified will to serve as a resource for survival and struggle. President Sun Yat-sen's theory of our national morality specially marks loyalty and filial piety as the first priority. In today's time, when we are fighting to the death with the cruel Japan, it is impossible to revive our homeland and protect our nation unless we swear to be loyal to the country and do our best to be filial to the nation. As the saying goes, the wind moves the grass. Also, as the saying goes, "hearing something, doing something first." The effect of the realization of things has always been attributed to the power of the public, and the responsibility of advocating is actually in the local heroes and outstanding people. If we do not promptly rise up today, practice what we preach, and do our best for our country, exhaust our responsibility to defend the country and the nation, and preserve the legacy of our ancestors, then we will inevitably sit and watch our descendants be slaughtered and enslaved. Being disloyal and unfilial, not only will we have no face to face our ancestors, but we will also be despised by the people of the world. Master or slave, honor or disgrace, we must compete for this moment. This is what our compatriots across the country, especially the local wise men, should deeply and quickly reflect on. The cruel Japan has invaded our country and肆肆 poison. From the three northeastern provinces to North China, Central China, and South China, wherever the Japanese knives have reached, they have not been spared from burning, robbing, poisoning, and destroying production. Tracing its obvious sinister intentions, it not only wants to destroy our country, but also to eliminate our race. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, relying on our national military and civilians who deeply understand the great righteousness of loyalty and filial piety, they have vowed to make a deadly Zhou Xuan with the cruel Japan; or take the lead in carrying weapons, sacrificing blood and flesh in the front; or donating money and materials to help the army, destroying their homes and relieving the disaster; or exhausting their labor, enduring hardships, to engage in increased production and make up for the losses and destruction during the war. Therefore, united efforts are made, unyielding, and struggling arduously. Our country's War of Resistance has lasted for nineteen months. Although the Japanese soldiers have invaded deeply, their predicament of being trapped in a quagmire and struggling to advance or retreat has become even worse. Today, the international situation of Japan is deteriorating day by day, and its national strength has been exhausted. It is filled with the terrifying phenomenon of impending collapse. All war situations, one after another, are evolving just as we initially predicted. The goal of final victory is approaching us day by day. However, on the other hand, precisely because the Japanese know that they are on the verge of danger, they will inevitably exhaust their remaining strength to attempt a last desperate struggle. At this time, if any of our compatriots are slightly slack, then not only will all previous efforts be lost, but the tragedy of defeat and death will be imminent. If we can see through their dangers, strengthen our roots, and rely on our vast land and large population, and strive to enrich the supply of manpower and material resources, then we can overcome the cruel Japan and complete the great cause of national revival. This is truly the time for our entire country, especially the local wise men, to serve our lives in time. It is also the fate of our country for thousands of generations. Regarding enriching manpower and material resources and strengthening the power of resistance, the central and local governments should intensify efforts and promote them rapidly. In particular, this chairman sincerely hopes that the gentlemen and educators of knowledge, talent, and local reputation in all parts of the country will each serve their country, do their best, and advocate for the sake of the government and promote the rapid completion of achievements. The main points are as follows: First, assist the government in promoting military service to replenish the troops urgently needed for the War of Resistance. On the one hand, publicize the cruel facts of the cruel Japan and the relationship between the success or failure of the War of Resistance and the implementation of military service as much as possible to arouse the anti-Japanese consciousness of the people and promote their enthusiastic recruitment. On the other hand, the drawing of lots, punishing deserters, rewarding those who enlist, and caring for the families of those who go on expeditions should be assisted in various ways with local strength to ensure that the people are happy to join the army and rest assured to go to war. At the same time, the sons of the local gentry should take the lead in sending recruits to the army or sending them to take various military academies, regardless of whether they are selected or not, in order to advocate. The people will naturally follow suit. Then there will be countless fighters in the front, and the victory will be assured. Moreover, after the establishment of the conscription system, the conscription will be abolished, and the construction of the country and the security of the people will be supported for a long time. The credit lies in the country, and there is no end to it. It is not only the children who are famous in history, but also fulfill the meaning of loyalty and filial piety. Second, actively develop the local economy to replenish the sources for long-term resistance. Modern warfare is completely a total final of manpower and material resources. Moreover, at present, the occupation of several important cities in our country and the obstruction of foreign transportation ports have severely damaged industrial and commercial institutions, and all material resources are difficult to supply. Moreover, most of the people who have been employed in industry and commerce abroad have terminated their professions and returned to their hometowns due to war relations. Based on this fact, we should take this opportunity to correct the past mistake of focusing on urban construction, and establish a planned and organized development of the inland economy. On the one hand, it should maintain the supply of military needs for the War of Resistance, and on the other hand, it should establish a self-sufficient foundation for the people's daily necessities. Everything from opening up wasteland, afforestation, animal husbandry, to increase rural production; increase the production of raw materials, how to adapt to local conditions, raise funds and gather strength, and divide labor and cooperate, are all expected by our local sages to carefully purchase, and be念 念in all aspects of the economy. The government will definitely do its best to assist, especially. In particular, for the small-scale handicrafts of various families, which have always been developed in our country, are the most convenient to obtain materials, the widest to use, and the easiest to achieve results, the local gentry should make full use of the original foundation and provide assistance to support them, or expand their production, or improve the methods, or only expand their sales channels. All products that are beneficial to practical use, beneficial to the people's livelihood, and sufficient to supplement wartime needs should be used to the best of their ability. The chairman has often said that the key to the victory of the War of Resistance must be sought from doing no " idle people," " waste materials," " waste dumps," and " waste time," and that the goal of eliminating these four "waste" must be from the development of the local economy, increasing agricultural production, and actively assisting manual industries. It is believed that with the abundance of our country's products and the prosperity of manpower, if we can organize precisely and use it flexibly, then just by sustaining the economy, we can contain the Japanese army to death. The above two are the most simple and easy things to do in the general mobilization of our War of Resistance, and also the source of our military and financial resources for the War of Resistance. Since the Japanese invasion of the country three years ago, the recruitment of soldiers has been downgraded again and again. Now, people who do not meet the specified specifications have also been forced to enlist. The issuance of wartime public bonds has reached a total of 900 million yen. The temporary demands and voluntary donations are not included. Compared with each other, what our people bear and the obligations they fulfill are very different. What's more, our people are the country that is being invaded, and is the point that they survive or die, and the government still expects that our fellow countrymen will make efforts that are so easy. If the local gentlemen who have the responsibility to lead the people cannot personally lead the way, or cannot fulfill their responsibilities, then they are not what our people who have been baptized with thousands of years of loyalty and filial piety are willing to do. Furthermore, our millions of soldiers are fighting bravely on the battlefield, and tens of millions of compatriots in the occupied areas are suffering from the destruction of the cruel Japanese, fighting in a precarious situation. All compatriots should mobilize in the spirit of this and give as much support as possible, sharing joys and sorrows, to show the determination of the front and rear to hate the Japanese. All those who ban gambling, eliminate the opium trade, ban pornography halls, and correct all ills, the local gentry and educators must set an example, strongly advocate, and assist the government in its earnest implementation, directly transforming the local atmosphere, and indirectly enhancing the strength of the rear. Throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, there has never been a country that can achieve prosperity and strength with decadent customs. And the transformation of world customs and customs has never relied on a few virtues and morals, who are good at advocating and advocating. This chairman has been entrusted by his compatriots to take on the heavy responsibility of presiding over the overall situation of the War of Resistance. He is working hard day and night to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the country, and his spirit and mind are always in communion with the sages. I sincerely believe that the completion of this arduous mission cannot be achieved by one person, and it must rely on the sages of the whole country to work together in one mind and one virtue to make the best use of their talents and materials. Only then can we reap the benefits of the collective effort. I firmly believe that the sages of our country will all be able to express their sincerity and fulfill their responsibilities, and exhaust their unfulfilled strength to live up to the expectations. As for local advantages and disadvantages, and the hardships of the people, the sages in our region, based on their service experience, are welcome to state the facts truthfully, provided that they are beneficial to the facts, and we must adopt them sincerely and use them as a guide for discussion. Words cannot express everything, but only hope to work hard in time to achieve the success of long-term resistance and victory over Japan, and to complete our task of self-help and saving the country.

<h3 id="e13">The Situation in the Northwest and How to Defend It <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Bai Yun (Continued)</p>
<p>Many people are quite worried that after the Yellow River freezes in winter, people will cross and invade Shaanxi. This is an overestimation. The Yellow River only freezes in winter in the upper reaches of Hequ County, and only the areas of northwestern Shanxi and southern Sui have this danger. Below Hequ, especially below Yumenkou, the current is rapid, and it rarely freezes. According to an old man in Tongsui, as far as he can remember, the Fenglingdu river froze only twice: once in the 17th year of Guangxu and once in the 18th year of the Republic. Vehicles and horses could travel on the ice, but both times there was heavy snowfall of two to three feet, and the climate was exceptionally cold. In ordinary cold weather, it will absolutely not freeze. Judging from this year's climate, it is even less likely to freeze. Currently, large ice floes are constantly sliding downstream, making it even more inconvenient for the enemy to cross secretly.</p>
<p>To defend the Northwest, the river defense of Guanzhong is naturally the most important. After crossing the river in southern Sui, the land is mostly sandy and difficult for the army to march. After crossing the river in northern Shaanxi and western Henan, there are many mountains, making marching even more difficult, so river defense is easier. Since the enemy's attack on the Northwest is focused on Xi'an, the river defense of Guanzhong is relatively important. This section of river defense includes Hancheng, Yangban, Chaoyi, Tongguan, and Chuxian. Among these places, the river defense around Pingmin and Tongguan is particularly important. The banks of the Han River in Hancheng are all cliffs. If well-trained artillery units and a considerable force are stationed there, it will be easier to defend. From Pingmin County to the Sanhekou near Tongguan, there are flat river beaches, reaching four or five li in width at the widest point. Moreover, Yongji County is occupied by the enemy, and the area around Tongguan, Pingmin County, and Chaoyi County is under enemy artillery control. If the enemy launches boats from Han Titown (south of Yongji) to cross the river, they can go downstream to land at Fumin Village in Pingmin County. After landing, a few miles northwest is Chaoyi County. If we cannot eliminate the enemy on the river beach, then Chaoyi and Dali cannot be defended. Dali is an important military town north of the Wei River within Tongguan. The enemy will surely attack Sanyuan and other places from the west, flanking the rear of Xi'an, to coordinate with the enemy's frontal attack on Tongguan from the Longhai Railway line to invade Xi'an. Therefore, the river defense in Guanzhong is most important in Pingmin. Tongguan has a strategic location, and it is not easy for the enemy to cross the river.</p>
<p>Recently, we have increased a large number of extremely elite troops, including mechanized units, to the river defense area of Hancheng and Tongguan. There are especially many troops stationed around Chaoyi. Heavy troops are stationed within a hundred li of the Yellow River. The water and land transportation connecting the Wei and Luo Rivers within Guanzhong has been completed. Thousands of civilians are constantly working on river defense projects under the command of the troops, so the river defense is extremely solid, and the rear can rest assured.</p>
<p>The government is actively preparing to defend the Northwest, not only increasing river defense forces but also reinforcing troops to Shanxi. What is hoped for from the rear is to take advantage of this period of lull in the war and intensify the mobilization of the people and all anti-Japanese preparations. Do not become complacent because of the temporary stability in the Northwest. Whether the war of resistance on the outer lines in the Northwest can be victorious and whether the river defense can be consolidated cannot rely solely on military affairs. We must integrate the entire Northwest's politics and popular mobilization, centered on Xi'an, and coordinate with military affairs to complete the task of defending the Northwest, so that there is a real guarantee.</p>
<p>7.  The Current Situation of Tongguan</p>
<p>If we can recover Yongji, then the enemy in the Fenglingdu and Han Tangzhen area will naturally be unable to gain a foothold, and Tongguan will naturally be stable. Otherwise, the Tongguan, Pingmin, and Chaoyi area will constantly be under the control of the enemy's artillery across the river. Even if the enemy does not cross the river, it will be difficult to stabilize. The Tongguan Longhai Railway transportation cannot be restored.</p>
<p>For months, the enemy in Fenglingdu has been shelling Tongguan from time to time. This is not an attempt to cross the river, but to disrupt our Longhai Railway transportation and destroy our Tongguan fortress. The purpose of disrupting the Longhai Railway transportation is to halt our east-west military transportation of reinforcements to southern Shanxi and supplies. There is an iron bridge in Shuiguan inside the south gate of Tongguan. The enemy artillery used this as a target and concentrated fire on it. Before it was broken, a shot was fired every ten seconds or so. The enemy expended one or two hundred shells to break this bridge, which was a considerable cost. After the bridge was broken, they prevented us from repairing it and continued to shell it from time to time. But we finally repaired the bridge using special methods, and the enemy's shelling lost its effectiveness. However, to prevent us from resuming traffic, they still shell it from time to time, day and night. Although our special transport rate can still pass, for the safety of passengers, passenger cars are divided into sections to operate inside and outside the pass. The middle section of several tens of li uses the highway for contact, which is quick, stable, and safe. Transportation is as usual, and the enemy's plan has been exhausted. Originally, our river defense also has elite artillery, and our artillery positions are higher than the enemy's artillery positions across the river, making it very easy to spot the enemy's artillery positions and eliminate them. But in order to save valuable artillery shells, we never fire without aim, and every shot must hit, destroying enemy artillery. In recent months, we have destroyed dozens of enemy guns. Now that the traffic on the Longhai Railway is no longer afraid of enemy shelling, we will let them fire day and night. Experts estimate that each unexploded shell fired by the enemy (made in Showa 13th year) is worth two or three hundred yuan. This kind of "self-destruction warfare" by the enemy is beneficial to us. Naturally, the more shelling, the better. The people in Tongguan city have been almost completely evacuated due to constant bombing by enemy aircraft and continuous shelling by mortars. Of the original residents and merchants, numbering over 25,000, only four or five hundred poor people who have no way to leave the city remain. Seven or eight out of ten houses have been bombed and collapsed. Except for the military and police agencies that continue to be stationed as usual, all other agencies have moved to other locations to work. Therefore, Tongguan has now become a purely military fortress, and the defense has become more solid. The enemy's conspiracy to shake our military and civilians has no effect. I hope that our people will absolutely not be worried by the constant shelling sounds in Tongguan. That is exactly the same as the enemy's alarm bell urging us to intensify the war of resistance. The people in the four townships of Tongguan are intensifying mobilization under the sound of this alarm bell every day. The river defense teams formed by able-bodied men assist the troops in defending the river day and night. The rear should be calm. (January 8th, in Xi'an)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The League of Nations Administrative Council Accepts the Resolution to Aid China, Requests That Relevant Countries Examine Our Demands, Representative Gu Reserves the Right to Re-appeal <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 20th] Today, the League of Nations Administrative Council unanimously adopted the Chinese famine case and reiterated the various recognitions taken by the League of Nations in the past, such as the League of Nations General Assembly resolution passed on October 6, 1937, the Administrative Council resolutions passed on February 2 and May 14, 1938, and the Administrative Council report of September 30, 1938. Today's resolution also stated, "The League of Nations Administrative Council has listened to the report of the Chinese representative. In that report, the Chinese representative refused to accept Japan's demand to build a new order in East Asia, and at the same time summarized several recommendations of the Chinese government. The Administrative Council also found that several member states have already taken individual actions to aid China. It is now invited that each member state, especially those with direct relations with the Far East, and other countries with the same relations, consult with each other to examine the recommendations made by the Chinese representative in the Administrative Council on January 17, 1939. This recommendation is to take effective measures to assist China." Dr. Gu Weijun said, "I will vote in favor of adopting this resolution. Judging from my statement to the Administrative Council on Tuesday, this resolution clearly failed to satisfy the Chinese government. But the reason why I am still willing to accept it is because I want a unanimous agreement. Only this is the case. I am willing to abide by government instructions and declare here that although I accept the resolution, I still make a reservation, that is, the Administrative Council recognizes that the Chinese government has the intention to re-appeal."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 20th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting last night at 9 o'clock and adjourned at 10:30. It formally passed the recommendations on the China and Spain issues. The Administrative Council can formally pass these two cases at a public meeting this afternoon. The representatives attending the meeting refused to announce the detailed content of the resolution, only saying that the representatives had universally expressed agreement with the two cases.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 20th] According to representatives attending last night's closed-door meeting of the Administrative Council, the draft resolution on the China issue is very long, suggesting that member states consider the various demands stated in the speech of the Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Gu Weijun, and consider holding consultations with non-member states such as the United States. Dr. Gu Weijun made a statement to reporters after the meeting adjourned, saying that he was deeply disappointed with this resolution and that China would continue to appeal to the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 19th] Although the Chinese representative Gu Weijun and the Spanish representative Taldi Yu actively requested assistance at the closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday, there was no practical solution to the issues of China and Spain in the meeting. It is reported that the Spanish representative requested to form a committee of representatives from six countries, including Spain, the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Belgium, and Sweden, to punish the dictatorships, but the result of the meeting was only to submit a non-substantial bill on the public bombing of cities to the closed-door meeting tonight for discussion, and then submit it to the public conference tomorrow. When six countries, including Latvia, Yugoslavia, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, held a closed-door meeting, the Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun requested sanctions against Japan, but no agreement was reached. The League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss it again tonight. It is reported that the Administrative Council does not approve of China immediately forcing its petition to the League of Nations to succeed, because it is better to wait for the results of the diplomatic notes sent to Japan by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France before making a decision.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] Spanish Foreign Minister Talfa Yu addressed the public meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, saying that the air raids in Spain were initiated by Germans and Italians, and "Italian newspapers not only described this bombing behavior but also openly took pride in it. I know that Spaniards must not want to bomb Spain. It must have been instigated by Germans and Italians."</p>
<p>Germany Aiding Italy's Invasion of French Territory; Gains Freedom of Action in Spain</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Political commentary authority Madame Tabouis wrote in the Labor News today that Hitler and Mussolini have reached a compromise on the Mediterranean and Spanish issues. The author said she learned from a Rome source that Germany assisted Italy's requests to obtain Djibo, Tunisia, and disarm Corsica. Hitler believed that this would make Italy's position in the Mediterranean more superior. In order to repay Germany's assistance, Mussolini had to reluctantly allow Germany to have freedom of action in Spain. In exchange, the author also stated that in order to adapt to its rights, Germany will soon supply the Spanish rebels with a large number of heavy artillery, aircraft technology, and talent.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, Upper, 9th] The Battle of Igualada has begun today. This place is the gateway to Barcelona and is only thirty-three miles from the Catalan capital. In the evening, Franco's troops arrived at the foot of the mountain, about three miles from their target. The rebel artillery bombarded the surrounding roads all day long. The light artillery teams loaded by mule trains advanced along the eastern slopes of Queralt. After the rebel artillery arrived at their positions, they bombarded Igualada. Rebel aircraft bombed the government army's front lines and strafed them with machine guns, then returned to the rear, and the artillery bombarded again. At the same time, the rebels used a thousand trucks to transport infantry from Monmenc and Aguilo to the front lines, preparing to attack as soon as the tanks and armored vehicles cleared the obstacles. At noon today, the main force of the rebels had advanced three miles into the steep mountain valley. Their front line has approached Pontons. If they occupy the town, the main force of the rebels will rush into the transportation network between Igualada and Vilafranca. It is said that the Ugg 1st Division is descending from Pens to Silide, and the Mastralasgos is speeding along the Lerida and Barcelona highway to the north of the village, and has crossed Montefalco. Tonight, the rebel headquarters reported that "our army is progressing rapidly."</p>
<p>Lloyd George and the Labor Party Request a Halt to the Ban on Arms Shipments to Spain</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Wales, 19th] Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, together with members of the Labor Party, unanimously demanded that the government stop the decree banning the shipment of arms to Spain and condemned those "in high positions" for not allowing Spain to become an outer court of various dictators. "Looking at the history of our England, our relationship with Spain has never been as special as it is today, and Spain is the key to our commercial lines. Our government is publicly elected by the people, and the dictators have actually taken this key from the hands of our government. They allow this key to be returned to our country after the democratic government is driven out of Spain. Is it not ridiculous, and some people in high positions actually believe it? Every time the dictators break their promises, they declare an even deeper belief in them. Is it not strange?</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The National Labor Congress, representing the Labor Party, the Trade Union Federation, and the Parliamentary Labor Party, sent a letter to Chamberlain, requesting that measures be taken immediately to stop the policy of non-interference in the Spanish war, and said, "According to international law, the Spanish government originally had the right to purchase arms, but the democratic countries have never been willing to recognize this. On the contrary, the dictatorships are still continuing to assist the Spanish rebels, resulting in a one-sided benefit for the fascist traitors."</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] According to the official announcement here yesterday, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will visit Warsaw from Berlin on the 25th of this month and return to the country on the 27th. According to the National Socialist Party's newspaper, the Kogneo, German Air Minister General Goering will follow German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw, because he intends to participate in the hunting meeting in Kota Lu City Forest in mid-February. At that time, he will meet with many Polish political figures. According to semi-official sources, the Duke of Koburg will visit Poland on the 26th of this month, and will stay in Warsaw for three days in his capacity as the president of the International Military Veterans Association to participate in the grand ceremony celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Indian leader Gandhi wrote an article in the "Church of England Newspaper": "Palestine belongs to the Arabs, and England belongs to the English. Their meaning is the same. To make the Arabs suffer at the hands of the Jews is inhumane." He pointed out that he did not want to maintain the Arab's excessive actions. He mentioned the Jewish people's demand to return to their homeland and questioned, "Since they grew up here, why can't they take this place as their homeland like other people?" He mentioned the atrocities against the German people and said, "The ancient tyrants are still not as crazy as Hitler's actions." He mentioned the German Onintai and said, "I believe that if there are knowledgeable people among them who come out to lead non-violent actions, then their winter's disappointment will be transformed into summer's hope in an instant. The situation of being trafficked today can easily be transformed into a definite force. This is what unarmed men and women with the power to endure hardship can do.

<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 20th] Hitler's meeting with Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Mo Zhanlov, has caused bizarre rumors from all sides. Some people even say that after the end of the war in the west, Germany and Russia will reconcile. However, according to the official Moscow newspaper, Baishi Opinion, this is completely unfounded and ridiculous. Especially Germany has no need for the Soviet Union except for raw materials, but raw materials can also be obtained from other places. The Soviet Union has no need for Germany either. Even if it wants German assistance in technology, it is not possible due to political institutions. The Communist Party has never suddenly changed its policies. Anti-fascism is forever deeply hated by the Soviet Union, it is said.</p>

Its military equipment has been greatly improved and includes several four-inch guns and a crew of 74 people.</p>
<h3 id="e22">U.S. Naval Expansion Plan; Government Has Submitted It to Congress; Denies Approval of Fortifications in Guam <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. government has submitted a naval expansion plan to Congress, requesting permission for the government to build or improve naval bases in important military areas. Reporters from this agency have received reports that the naval plan also includes granting the Philippines immediate and unconditional independence. Therefore, the opposition voices in Congress are unfolding. Those who oppose the fortification of Guam claim that if this movement in Congress is approved, there will be substantial changes in the plan to fortify Guam. The chairman of the Naval Committee, Vincent, also said that the so-called approval of the fortification of Guam only approves the construction of several critical projects, including the fortification of Guam. The naval plan submitted this time gives the Navy Department comprehensive powers to choose the most suitable plan for fortification or improvement. A Zheng army statement also said that the case has not been approved by the White House but has been approved by the Budget Bureau.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] President Roosevelt denied that he had approved an appropriation of $5 million to immediately build a first-class naval base in Guam. This matter was mentioned by Admiral Hepburn in his newly drafted report. According to White House personnel, the government's attitude can generally be represented by Lippmann's article in today's "Pioneer Forum."

<p>In early April of this year, the Iron Guard, using weapons supplied by Berlin, plotted a rebellion in Bucharest. The plot was discovered by the government due to a lack of secrecy. As a result, Codreanu was arrested, and his accomplice, General Antonescu, was exiled. Documents seized proved that they intended to eliminate all opposition after the coup. King Carol was not vigilant about this case. Later, the Iron Guard automatically announced its dissolution. The authorities did not deeply investigate the ringleaders, and Carol wanted to compromise with them and incorporate the group for his own use. Therefore, there are still many members of the Iron Guard in the government, such as the minority minister Tătărăscu and the propaganda minister Te Ieșanu. After this incident, Carol also took the opportunity to eliminate dissidents and seal up many political parties.</p>
<p>One. The National Peasant Party</p>
<p>The National Peasant Party is the largest bourgeois democratic party in Romania. It has some mass base among peasants and the lower and middle classes in cities. They advocate upholding the constitution, uniting with Britain, France, and the Balkan countries, and opposing the German-Italian axis. The leader is Maniu. Before the parliamentary re-election in November 1937, the Communist Party, seeing the rampant fascist reactionary forces, proposed to domestic democratic parties to form a united anti-fascist front. As a result, the bourgeois parties stubbornly adhered to their prejudices and refused to unite. Maniu politely agreed with the Iron Guard on three points, promising not to infringe upon each other. The result was a disastrous defeat. Later, after the Goga cabinet stepped down, they realized the need to organize a democratic united front to confront the fascists. However, King Carol had already decided to implement a monarchical dictatorship. Even all constitutional forms were abolished, and political party activities were banned. The rights stipulated in the constitution have been fundamentally overthrown.</p>
<p>Two. Other Political Parties</p>
<p>On the right wing, there are also the (1) National Liberal Party, led by Tătărescu. It had considerable influence when Tătărescu was in power; (2) the German Party, led by Himmler's henchman Fomberling; (3) the Romanian Front, led by Voiculescu; and (4) the Christian National Party, led by Goga and Cuza.</p>
<p>On the left wing, there are the (1) United Socialist Party, led by Ghelerter. Many members are Trotskyists; (2) the Radical Peasant Party, led by Lupu; (3) the Social Democratic Party; and (4) the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(Four) Domestic Ethnic Conflicts</p>
<p>One. The Issue of Ethnic Minorities</p>
<p>The ethnicities in Europe are inherently complex. Fifteen countries have so-called ethnic minorities. The total population is around 30 million. Narrow nationalism cannot resolve this issue. Some say this is the evil created by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, this is not entirely true. Before the war, the total population of ethnic minorities under foreign rule was even greater, around 100 million. It has been greatly reduced after the war. However, it has not been fundamentally resolved. Currently, Poland has the most ethnic minorities. The total population is over 8 million. The second is Czechoslovakia, with over 4 million people. If the 4 million Catalans and 1 million Basques in Spain are also considered ethnic minorities, Spain ranks second. Yugoslavia rules over more than 2 million ethnic minorities, including Germans, Magyars, Romanians, and Albanians. Italy has over 1 million, and Latvia has 500,000. Hungary has about 800,000. The total population of ethnic minorities in Romania is over 4 million, including Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Poles, Gagauzians, Bulgarians, and Yugoslavs. After the war, she acquired a lot of territory from the Austro-Hungarian Empire: (1) Transylvania and (2) Bukovina. However, Romanians only account for 59% of the population in the former and 34% in the latter.</p>

<p>[United Press, Singapore, 20th] McNair, while traveling to Manila on the Empress of Asia mail ship, told reporters that the fortress of Singapore, based on his impressions after inspecting its fortifications, will occupy an extremely important position in the Far East in the future. Singapore symbolizes British strength in the Far East, and its naval base has unlimited conveniences. Regarding whether the United States has a similar naval base for the US Asian Fleet to utilize, McNair declined to comment, but said that the union of Britain and the United States is the most reliable guarantee for clarifying the world.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] According to officials from the Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Secretary Wallace's proposal to convene an international cotton industry conference is actually hinting to major cotton-producing countries to cooperate with the United States; otherwise, the United States may find ways to enable its exporters to cope with the price of foreign cotton. The United States may also imitate the method of subsidizing the flour industry by subsidizing cotton exporters or lending them money to lower the price of US cotton and facilitate sales. According to general opinion, the current loan proposed by the US government for the International Flour Conference is greatly related to flour industry subsidies, so cotton industry subsidies in the future may have the same effect.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Manila, 20th] Yesterday afternoon, a sudden incident between Japanese and Filipino people occurred in a certain area of Luzon Island.

The remaining Japanese people fled back to the ship they arrived on. The arrested suspect has been taken back to Manila for investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, it is reported that Japanese fishing boats have repeatedly intruded into Philippine territorial waters and illegally fished in restricted areas over the past few months. Therefore, the authorities are quite angry about this. At the same time, Luzon has requested increased troops for protection.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e30">Leadership by Local Gentry <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang sent a telegram on the 19th to local gentry and educators across the country, hoping that they would take the lead in promoting conscription and developing the local economy in their respective hometowns, to supplement the inadequacies of government orders and expedite the success of these endeavors. The entire text is earnest and clearly explains the intentions. All those who love their hometowns and motherland, upon reading it, should be eager to participate. All those who are unwilling to let their fields and homes be ravaged by invaders should resolutely follow the advice, lead their younger brothers, become national pillars, and contribute their wealth to assist in construction. Moreover, the local gentry are best suited to disseminate government policies and laws and express the hardships and demands of the people between the government and the masses. "Leadership by the local gentry" is also relevant here. It should also be noted that (1) leadership by the local gentry is not compatible with feudal customs and conservative thinking. Therefore, the phrases "lead by example" and "promote public opinion" mentioned in Chairman Chiang's telegram cannot be taken lightly. All outdated customs, conservative thinking, and sectarian prejudices should be strongly rejected. (2) Leadership is not compatible with monopolization. Therefore, local gentry should particularly understand the profound meaning of Chairman Chiang's telegram: "Only by making the best use of everyone's talents and abilities can we achieve the success of many hands making light work." Those who have prestige among the people and have experience in mobilizing the people and specialized skills must be vigorously supported for national use, regardless of factions or prejudices. Only then can we live up to the earnest intentions of the highest leader.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Guerrilla Cadre Training Class <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the central authorities have decided to first establish a guerrilla cadre training class somewhere, with Tang Enbo and Ye Jianying responsible for presiding over it, in order to expand the results of guerrilla warfare. This shows that the anti-Japanese guideline of "guerrilla warfare being more important than positional warfare" in the second phase of the war will be gradually implemented. At present, the situation in the Northwest battlefield may become increasingly serious, and the war in the Southwest has become more intense. However, the guerrilla warfare that we rely on to win the second phase of the war has not yet been widely developed. The lack of cadres is also an important reason. Now that Generals Tang and Ye, who are known for their prestige and experience, have taken the lead in training cadres, it is firmly believed that it will greatly benefit the war of resistance. However, judging from the current situation, this type of cadre training should be expanded to a national scale to meet the urgent needs of various war zones. In addition, in the Northwest, there were originally such cadre training schools, but due to various reasons, the trained cadres could not go to various places to serve the country, and the youth who went to study were often obstructed or arrested. It is hoped that this phenomenon will no longer exist after this Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Process of the Shanghai Customs Being Dealt With <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondence from Shanghai by this Newspaper) Zhi Ping</p>
<p>The Beginning of Negotiations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13, Japanese ships entering and exiting the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts have relied on their military force to refuse customs inspection. At the same time, Japanese goods have taken advantage of their tax-free convenience to be dumped in large quantities in the Shanghai market. After our army withdrew westward, unscrupulous merchants colluded with Japanese merchants, and the import of smuggled goods became even more rampant. In the first four months of the 27th year, according to Japanese reports, the liaison ships from Japan to Shanghai totaled 13 times. Other ships totaled 15 times, carrying a total of more than 54,000 tons of goods. Major smuggled goods included rayon, sugar, piece goods, soybeans, soybean oil, cigarette paper, and seafood. The impact on the customs' revenue was enormous.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Shanghai customs revenue ranked first in the country, reaching 20 million yuan per month at its peak. At this time, it had dropped to about 4 million yuan per month. The bondholders of various foreign debts guaranteed by customs revenue naturally became uneasy. The Japanese then used the restoration of customs rights as bait to entice the British to negotiate with them, threatening Shanghai Customs to accept the new tax rates set by the puppet organization.</p>
<p>The negotiations began as early as February of the 27th year, with the British ambassador to Japan negotiating with the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Initially, there was deep concern that the outside world would learn of it. By the time the negotiations ended in May, it was announced that the new tax rate would be officially implemented from June 1st. Thus, this play ××××××××× was completed.</p>
<p>The Content of the Agreement</p>
<p>On May 3, the British and Japanese sides simultaneously published a communique on the Shanghai Customs negotiations. The text was very brief, only stipulating that after deducting the principal and interest of foreign debts, the remaining Shanghai customs revenue would be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Other details were not mentioned. What was actually manifested after the agreement was established was that the Nanjing organization actually appointed a puppet official as the Shanghai Customs Superintendent. Although smuggling work in the Shanghai East District Customs resumed, the customs officers assigned were limited to Japanese or Western personnel. What is particularly noteworthy is that the implementation of the new tax rules eliminated the customs surtax, and an additional 5% disaster relief surtax was levied. The imported goods with reduced taxes included cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, cotton textiles, wool textiles, rayon, seafood, sugar, gasoline, cement, and miscellaneous goods, which were more beneficial to the import of Japanese goods. In addition, among the exported goods, cotton and mineral products, which are raw materials for manufacturing munitions, were completely exempt from tax.</p>
<p>The original text of the communique issued by the British and Japanese on the Shanghai Customs negotiations is as follows:</p>
<p>"Beginning in February of this year (1938), the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs conducted informal negotiations regarding the repayment of foreign debts guaranteed by Chinese customs revenues and other related matters. As a result of the exchange of views, the Japanese government notified the British government of its proposed temporary measures for adjusting this matter during wartime. The British government stated in its reply to Japan that Britain did not oppose the implementation of these temporary wartime measures and heard that the United States and France also did not intend to raise any objections. If there is a sudden change in the economic situation, these measures may be reconsidered. All tax revenues collected by customs at various ports in the Japanese-occupied areas will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. From these deposits, the foreign debt repayments shall be issued to the Inspector General of Customs to fully fulfill the obligations of foreign debts and reparations guaranteed by customs revenues. The payment of these foreign debts and reparations shall be the first expenditure after deducting customs administrative expenses and certain customs payments and subsidies. The amount of foreign debt payable at each port shall be determined each month according to the percentage of the total customs revenue of all ports in the previous month. The Boxer Indemnity funds due to Japan, which have been deposited in HSBC since last September, will be paid to the Japanese government. In addition, arrangements will be made to fulfill Japan's share of the future payments of the Boxer Indemnity and the 1913 Reorganization Loan, and to reimburse the Shanghai overdraft under the Shanghai foreign debt payment account accumulated by the Inspector General of Customs in HSBC since February of this year, and to transfer the surplus of customs duties in HSBC under the Japanese-occupied ports to the Yokohama Specie Bank for future payment of foreign debts.</p>
<p>Reactions from All Parties</p>
<p>One. Chinese Customs Staff Once Went on Strike. After hearing that the puppet organization appointed a member as the Customs Superintendent, all the Chinese staff of Shanghai Customs were indignant. On the morning of May 7, they went on strike and held a plenary meeting, resolving five points: (1) Request that the Customs Commissioner, Mr. ロフォード, and the Chinese Deputy Customs Commissioner, Mr. Qiū Qíwěi, come to the scene to explain the situation. (2) Elect representatives to establish the Shanghai Customs Chinese Staff Protection Association, with the aim of protecting the integrity of customs sovereignty. (3) Elect 35 executive committee members to form an executive committee. (4) Telegraph the central government to explain the current environment and the situation at sea, and request Minister Kong to clarify the methods. (5) Resolutely implement the strike before obtaining practical methods.</p>
<p>After the five resolutions were passed, senior customs officials believed that the situation was serious, so they attended to give instructions, trying their best to persuade them, believing that the customs was a government agency and had a significant relationship with shipping companies. The staff serving in the customs must not rush to leave their posts without receiving government orders. Moreover, various rumors are not true. They should not take any action to avoid affecting all parties and being taken advantage of by others.</p>
<p>During the wave, there was also an incident of customs officers being kidnapped, which was resolved through negotiations. There were also transfers to the Guangdong Customs. The wave then subsided.</p>
<p>Two. Our Government's Protest. After the news of the Shanghai Customs negotiation agreement was released, our ambassador to the United Kingdom first raised two points to the British government in opposition: (1) Britain recognizes Japan's control over the customs duties of the eight ports in North China. (2) The agreement contains provisions for repaying domestic debts. After the agreement communique was published, our government sent a note to the British Foreign Office, stating that China would never be bound by the measures agreed upon by Britain and Japan, and reserved China's complete right and freedom of action on its customs matters. It also denounced the actions of two foreign countries concluding an agreement on Chinese customs without China's consent. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Qiongya Chamber of Commerce Welcomes Representatives from Various Regions Yesterday; Discussing Major Plans for Saving and Building Qiong; Seeking to Concentrate the Strength of Qiong Overseas Chinese to Assist the Government in Urgently Rescuing Their Hometown; A Total of 32 Proposals from Various Representatives, All of Which Are Urgent <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Qiong overseas Chinese from various regions, in order to concentrate their strength and assist the government in saving the country and their hometown, recently convened a representative conference in Hong Kong. Details of the conference have already been reported. The first meeting was originally scheduled for yesterday, but the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, as representatives had not yet arrived, has postponed the date of the conference for several days. At the same time, in order to fulfill its duties as the host, it held a welcome reception at 2:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Qiongya Garrison Commander Yang Yongren, Overseas Chinese Affairs Director Xu Tianshen, Qiongshan County Magistrate Yun Zhenzhong, and overseas Qiong overseas Chinese representatives and fellow villagers in Hong Kong, totaling more than 100 people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chairman Zhou Wenzhi led the proceedings as usual and delivered a welcome speech expressing his welcome.</p>
<p>Motivation for the Convocation: Saving the Hometown and Saving the Country</p>
<p>He then reported on the motivation for convening this general representative conference, stating that many Qiongya fellow villagers have engaged in business overseas, and many guild halls or associations have been established in various places, but there is no established overall general organization. Therefore, communication between various places is very difficult. In this period of national crisis, for the sake of the motherland and the sake of their hometown, they should establish it as soon as possible. People can pool their efforts to save the country and their hometown. This time, the Haikou fellow villagers discussed this matter, and obtained the approval of senior hometown elders Minister Song (Ziwen), Commander Chen (Ce), and local officials. They jointly initiated the invitation of overseas hometown Qiong overseas Chinese to send representatives to Hong Kong to discuss organizing the "Overseas Qiong Overseas Chinese United General Association." As for the purpose of establishing the association, it is to connect the Qiong overseas Chinese from various ports, so that they can take consistent steps in future affairs related to the country, hometown, and all public undertakings, in order to achieve the effect of pooling efforts. Currently, during the national crisis, we the people should bear the responsibility and obligation of saving the country and our hometown, as well as the relief work for Qiong overseas Chinese and hometown relatives who are unemployed and displaced. Further speaking, our Qiongya hometown has always been known as a national treasure trove, such as forests and mineral resources. Most of the wealth remains untapped. Considering the reason, it is the lack of communication. Therefore, we hope that this general association can be realized as soon as possible. Moreover, our hometown Qiong overseas Chinese love the country and are unwilling to lag behind others, and they should love their hometown even more. They should contribute their personal views to the government and assist the government in improving politics and eliminating corruption in their hometown. Without a group organization, individual actions will make it difficult to convey the lower situation to the higher authorities. The leaders in their hometowns also deeply hope that overseas Qiong overseas Chinese organizations can be established as soon as possible to promote the aspirations of the Qiong overseas Chinese. Zhou finally stated that initiators Minister Song and Commander Chen were unable to attend due to attending the Fifth Plenary Session for military celebrations, and asked for their forgiveness.</p>
<p>Protecting Qiong, We Should Seek Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Next, Guo Juchuan, the representative of the Qiongzhou Association Federation of British Malaya, replied, hoping that his fellow villagers in Hong Kong would give him more advice and discuss major plans for saving the hometown and saving the country. Then, Qiongya Garrison Commander Yang Yongren stood up and gave a speech, stating that in this severe military environment, the position of Qiong is also dangerous. In the past, people always thought that the gains and losses of Hainan Island were enough to affect international relations, so they could temporarily feel at ease. At the same time, people also had this speculation about Guangzhou, but Guangzhou has now fallen. From this point of view, the word "international" is not reliable. We should rely on our own efforts to regenerate ourselves. The government has now decided to use every minute of time and every ounce of strength to be fully responsible for protecting the homeland. However, the current war cannot completely rely on the army. He hopes for the assistance of all the people of Qiong and hopes that the association will be established as soon as possible and will not hesitate to give advice to the authorities, point out errors, and provide opinions to improve. The authorities should adopt them as much as possible. After that, representatives from various places spoke one after another, and the meeting was dismissed at 5 o'clock. As for the date of the general assembly, it has not yet been decided. According to the chairman, a preparatory meeting will first be held during the day to review the proposals in groups.</p>
<p>32 Proposals, All Extremely Important</p>
<p>In addition, there were a total of 32 proposals from representatives from various places at the representative conference, all of which are practical and needed. They are listed below: (1) The Director of the Qiongya Haikou Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau should be nominated by the Qiongya Overseas Chinese General Association. (2) Petitioning the government to actively train strong men to strengthen self-defense and anti-Japanese forces. (3) Restoring the Haikou Shuichang Pier to facilitate travel. (4) Organizing Qiongya industry and commerce armed self-defense corps to assist the government in a long-term resistance war. (5) Immediately launching a Qiongya mass movement. (6) Levying a special wartime donation. (7) Temporarily changing the current education system. (8) Establishing Qiongya agricultural, industrial, and commercial schools to cultivate talents. (9) Investigating the exact number of Qiong overseas Chinese living abroad in order to concentrate strength. (10) Raising funds to organize the Qiongya Shihua Bank to save and build Qiong. (11) The Qiongzhou Guild Halls in various ports should have a uniform system to avoid branches. (12) Petitioning the government to authorize the Qiongya Overseas Chinese Affairs Office to issue passports for going abroad to facilitate Qiong travelers.

<p>United Air Lines previously ordered six giant Boeing Clipper aircraft in order to develop its business, and in the future, this type of giant aircraft will also fly between Hong Kong and the United States. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the most recently completed aircraft will be on a trial flight from the United States to Hong Kong in early next month, carrying only mail and cargo, not passengers. The second completed aircraft will be received by the company a few days later, and the third aircraft will also be completed next month. Because the company's transatlantic flights will not begin until May, the second and third aircraft will also be temporarily transferred to fly the weekly flights between Hong Kong and the United States. If this becomes a reality, there will be three such giant aircraft in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the headquarters of United Air Lines, which has been located in Alameda, is now being relocated to Treasure Island, the site of the World's Fair. After the meeting is completed, the entire island will be permanently prepared for seaplanes and ordinary airports.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Apparent Lifeboat Unloading Cargo – Four Coolies Fall into Hold, Severely Injured – Crane Cable Snaps, Plunging with Cargo – Head, Hands, and Internal Injuries All Severe, Lives Feared <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Steamship Company's "Manifest Destiny" steamer, which travels between Sandakan and Hong Kong, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, the 15th, and docked at buoy number 23. After unloading the cargo bound for Hong Kong, it is scheduled to depart for Sandakan today (the 21st). Therefore, various Hong Kong merchants wishing to ship goods to Sandakan via this vessel loaded their cargo onto lighters yesterday and transported it to the ship.  While unloading cargo was in full swing yesterday morning, the cable of the crane on the second deck of the ship suddenly snapped, causing four coolies to fall into the hold, suffering severe injuries. The injured included coolies Li Tai (47 years old), Li Bo (40 years old), Li Luo (24 years old), and Tao Bao (50 years old), who were hired to unload cargo. At the time, the four coolies were standing on the second deck, using the crane to lower cargo from the ship's deck to the bottom hold. Because the cargo was unusually heavy, the crane's cable was unable to bear the weight. When it reached the third level, with a snapping sound, the cable broke in the middle, and the cargo fell to the bottom of the hold. The four coolies, affected by the force of the impact, lost their footing and fell to the bottom as well. Because there were many boxed goods at the bottom of the hold, and the distance between the bottom of the hold and the deck was several yards, when the four coolies fell to the bottom, their heads and hands made contact with the boxed goods, resulting in severe injuries to their heads, hands, feet, and internal organs. They lay in a severely injured state at the bottom of the hold, gasping for breath, with fresh blood flowing from their wounds. People on the ship, seeing the crane break and the four coolies seriously injured, immediately informed the ship's owner, raised the police flag, and had people go down into the hold to carry the four injured men to the deck, first administering some medicine to stop the bleeding. Before long, a naval police boat noticed the ship flying the police flag and approached the ship. The water police boarded the ship and inquired, learning the above situation. They then carried the four injured men onto the water police boat and sailed to Blake Pier, telegraphing the Central Fire Brigade Bureau to dispatch ambulances to the scene. The four injured men were carried to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were so severe, even after the doctors treated them, they remained unconscious, and their lives were feared to be in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Our Country's Famous Painter, Wang Jiyuan, Passed Through Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Malaya – Continuing to Promote National Culture and Raise Funds for Refugees – Letter Sent to Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chairman Requesting Investigation of Slanderous Rumors <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The famous painter Mr. Wang Jiyuan, since the start of the War of Resistance, has gone to the Nanyang region to engage in official propaganda. Yesterday, he again passed through Hong Kong on the British ship "Cathay." A reporter met him at the wharf. According to him, this trip to Malaya is still to promote national culture, inspire patriotism among overseas Chinese, and he will then make another trip, staying for about three or four months before returning to the country. He also showed a recent letter to Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which is transcribed as follows: "Since the start of the War of Resistance, Jiyuan has held the position of advocating for national salvation from my place and am diligently striving to do my best in production and promotion, even traveling far across the oceans. Although it has been difficult, I have not dared to slack off. Counting from February of the 27th year [1938], I went to the Philippines, and in March I sold my works, donating half of the proceeds, 700 yuan, to the Bank of China in Hong Kong to be transferred to Mr. Du Yuesheng to help Shanghai refugees. In April, I held a solo exhibition in Singapore, selling works and donating half of the proceeds, 200-odd dollars, directly to the Singapore China Relief Committee. In the same month, I held a solo exhibition in Kuala Lumpur, selling works and still donating half of the proceeds, 390-odd dollars – equivalent to over 700 national dollars – directly to the Selangor Relief Committee. In May, I returned to the country and created over a hundred ink paintings and wrote about war zone relics. In August, I went to the west, and in September I went to Quanzhou, donating fifty pieces of calligraphy and paintings to the Penang China Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,000 dollars. In mid-October, I went to Kuala Lumpur again, donating fifty pieces of calligraphy and paintings to the Selangor China Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,400 Straits dollars. After the fall of Guangzhou, I donated twenty-five recent works to the Selangor Cantonese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,000 Straits dollars. Wherever I have gone, I have promoted national culture and inspired overseas Chinese in various places to continue to exert their patriotic strength. Making a living through art, I also take care of refugees. These are all facts. Unexpectedly, recently, villains have spread rumors, starting from Hankou and then Hong Kong, claiming that I embezzled a huge sum of 40,000 yuan in relief funds. Catching shadows and grasping the wind, it is naturally laughed at by those who know the truth. However, because the rumor-mongers are from the rear, it is clear that there is another purpose, what is being sabotaged. Jiyuan really cannot remain silent, so I dare to straightforwardly report this, respectfully requesting you to thoroughly investigate the truth and provide guidance so that I may follow it, so as to align with the national war of resistance front and not be shaken by the secret calculations of villains. I would be very grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e37">Hong Kong and Kowloon War Zone Service Corps Members – Serving in Military and Political Work on the Front Lines – Mostly on the East and West Battlefields <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong and Kowloon Community Relief Joint Association, after the July 7th Incident in the previous year, specially organized the Northbound War Zone Service Corps, recruiting over twenty enthusiastic young people to go through customs and, one week after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle (August 20th), departed from Hong Kong, taking the Guangdong-Hankou Railway north to the capital to serve the country, pioneering the return of young people to the country for service after the start of the War of Resistance. After the corps arrived in the capital, the central authorities sent them separately to the Military Affairs Commission Training Class and the Political Science School Special Training Class for training, and then dispatched them to various war zones in the east, west, and north for service. However, regarding the work situation after the corps' members were assigned, due to inconvenient transportation and communication, news was scarce, and few people in Hong Kong knew about it. A reporter met with the chairman of the corps, Du Qizhang, yesterday and learned the details of the corps' recent situation. According to him, those currently on the western battlefield include Zeng Mei, Zhang Rentao, Zhuang Difu, and Lin Jiazhao, who are working in the People's Movement Guidance Office of the ×th War Zone Commander's Headquarters, serving as people's movement instructors in various counties. On the eastern battlefield, Chen Zhi is in the political department of the ×××th Division, and Huang Wei and Zhang Sheng are in the Military Affairs Commission Training Corps. Zhan Lin is serving in the Nanchang Women's Improvement Association, and Zhou Zhansheng has entered a military academy for further study and is now also dispatched to front-line work. Furthermore, Chen Zhifeng, the communications team leader of the corps, returned to Hong Kong from the front line in Nanxun a month ago, reporting on the work he has done over the past year and collecting various medicines and supplies. He is scheduled to go north again during the day to return to his unit for service.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the ban on prostitution in Hong Kong, the number of clandestine prostitutes has greatly increased, and the poison has become increasingly rampant. Furthermore, the bandits who engage in human trafficking see this as a huge market for their operations, each acting as cause and effect. Therefore, due to the rampant nature of clandestine prostitution, these unscrupulous elements have become even more active. The Hong Kong government authorities have always been concerned about this matter and have recently intensified their anti-prostitution campaign. According to this newspaper, Ms. Harrier of the Hong Kong Deputy Secretary for Chinese Affairs has made great efforts in breaking up human trafficking rings, having solved many cases. Yesterday, she broke up another such human trafficking ring somewhere in Yau Ma Tei, rescuing six girls on the spot, all under the age of twenty. Among them, one was only thirteen years old, and another was only fourteen. A suspected female accomplice, Ms. So-and-so, was arrested and will be prosecuted at the Kowloon Magistracy next Tuesday for the crime of harboring girls under the age of sixteen for immoral purposes. As for the two youngest girls, they were sent to the Salvation Army Home for care.</p>
<h3 id="e43">British Ministry of Civil Aviation – Planning to Establish a North Atlantic Air Route – 3,000 Miles from Ireland to Newfoundland – Will Benefit Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Business Significantly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>According to aviation sources, the British Ministry of Civil Aviation is planning to establish a North Atlantic air route, with a route from northern Ireland to Newfoundland, a total distance of approximately 2,000 miles. The establishment of this route will indirectly benefit Hong Kong significantly. Since the two major global air routes (Pan American and Imperial Airways) have Hong Kong as their Far East terminus, flights from Europe to Hong Kong must pass through the Suez Canal and Penang before transferring to Hong Kong. Flights from the United States to Hong Kong pass through the Pacific Ocean, via Honolulu, Guam, and the Philippines to Hong Kong. Passengers wishing to travel from Europe to the Far East via the Americas must first travel by sea to New York, then transfer by air to San Francisco and take a Pan American flight to Hong Kong, involving many transfers along the way. The establishment of the North Atlantic route will remedy this deficiency. The British civil aviation authorities have already established powerful radio stations in western Ireland and Newfoundland to receive weather reports from observatories and ships at sea around the world. After the route is established, those wishing to circumnavigate the globe by plane from Hong Kong, starting eastward, can take a Pan American plane to San Francisco, then transfer to Vancouver, then cross Canada to Newfoundland, and take a flight across the Atlantic to Southampton, England, and then follow the Imperial Airways route through the Suez Canal and Penang back to Hong Kong. Traveling westward, they can first fly to Penang and finally return to Hong Kong via the Americas. It is reported that the route will initially only carry mail and will not carry passengers for the time being.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the Jinshan steamer will go to the province again during the day and will change its route to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line in the future. A reporter asked the person in charge of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Macau Steamship Company about this yesterday, and he denied the above statement, saying that there are still several conditions for the resumption of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route that have not been negotiated. The Jinshan steamer's recent voyage to Guangzhou was actually a trial voyage in nature. The date of full resumption can only be realized after all conditions have been fully resolved and agreed upon by both parties. It is still far from this time, and the Jinshan steamer will not sail to Guangzhou again in the near future. The rumors are not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Tour of the Refugee Industrial Society <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>Special Report from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, we will always remember that Shanghai, a prosperous and beautiful city, had just fallen. Mr. He Xiangning made a proposal at the first joint meeting of the Four Women's Associations – to establish a women's refugee vocational training center. At that time, this proposal was enthusiastically supported. Time passes really quickly, and it is now almost a year later. Today, one year later, Ms. Wang Liming, a politician, has finally combined with a group of enthusiastic local women to establish the Refugee Industrial Society amidst difficulties and hardships. Although the scale is not very grand, this must be considered a glorious creation of the Hong Kong women's community, and its future development can be expected. Running around here, the reporter will roughly record the impressions gained from touring this Refugee Industrial Society:</p>
<p>Passing through the shipyard where the masts stand tall and the green waves ripple on the Triangular Pier, following the twists and turns of the tram tracks, I stepped onto the upper floor of a large and new building. On the second floor and third floor, the smell of putty, along with a tense atmosphere, rushed into my heart. Stepping into the entrance of the fourth floor, "click-clack," "click-clack," the sound of sewing machines kept flowing, exuding a busy and tense mood inside. Knocking on the door, after a while, a woman wearing a blue cloth long shirt came out, and after clarifying the intention, she let the reporter in. Looking around, the spacious veranda on the left was filled with long and wide tables, surrounded by working girls. In the main hall on the right, a wide table was displayed, and a group of girls were working there. Behind each wall pillar, a sewing machine was piled up. One cannot help but admire the cleverness of the arrangement in making good use of the space.</p>
<p>These dozens of daughters who have tasted the pain of exile are either working with their heads down or working while talking and laughing. Everyone is always working with their hands never stopping. Seeing the unfamiliar guest, a blush of shyness appeared on everyone's faces, with a little bit of shyness. Talking with Miss Luo Qiao'er, who is responsible for guiding their work there, about their living conditions, I heard that after getting up every day, they have breakfast, do exercises, and then start working. They work eight hours a day, read books in the evening, and have scheduled times for eating and working. Everything in life is completely disciplined. They are obediently working, warmly caring for each other, more like the female workers in a refugee industrial society, more like a beautiful school, and a happy family. Their hearts are joyfully jumping, even though the three meals are so simple.</p>
<p>Their work is temporarily divided into five departments: sewing clothes, Gu embroidery, sewing shoes, knitting wool sweaters, and making flowers. After a short period of guidance, they are all able to work very quickly. Now, almost all kinds of products have already been pre-ordered. However, although they are working with their hands and feet without stopping, they only earn an average of thirty cents a day, which is still far from enough to cover the expenses here. This really requires a good method!" Miss Luo said worriedly, exhaling a breath. Their spirit of fighting and hard work is very admirable.</p>
<p>However, we feel that this refugee center is not very suitable in this prosperous location. At the very least, it has to bear an expensive rent. Secondly, it has not been able to plan for the production of many low-cost and high-profit necessities, such as soap, cosmetics, toothbrushes, and other items. Secondly, there is still room for consideration in the allocation of manpower in the work. With such a small number of people, we think it is not appropriate to produce several different items. It is best to divide it into two or three departments. Moreover, the stages of work also need to be done in order. For example, when making flowers, one person cuts paper, one person cuts wire, and one person glues. Such division of labor and cooperation is always more economical than the time it takes for one person to make a flower by themselves. If manpower and resources can be improved considerably, I believe that production will definitely increase, and then the required expenses can definitely be met with ease!</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that all the enthusiastic people in charge of the Refugee Industrial Society will continue their efforts to establish the second, third, and so on… refugee industrial societies, directly relieving those fellow women who have encountered difficulties, and indirectly using production to build a new China.</p>
<h3 id="e46">From Lian County to Hong Kong (II) <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Min</p>
<p>——Walking Nearly Eight Hundred Li——</p>
<p>On the third day, we took a car early in the morning and arrived at Qingyuan City. Because of the fear that the × people might again invade north along Sanshui, threatening Sihui, which is located to its west, with a state of war, it would not be easy to pass through the shortcut on the western side of the southern Guangdong battlefield. Therefore, before hurriedly heading towards Zhaoqing along the eastern bank of the Beijiang River, the street below the county seat we passed through was originally a district with rows of shops, but it was almost razed to the ground when Guangzhou fell. It is said that the compatriots who suffered the disaster were able to escape in time, so it was not too tragic. Regarding the public security issue on the Qingyuan-Sihui highway, I inquired with the head of the education section of the Qingyuan County government, and he assured me that there had been no disturbances for travelers in recent months. Then I felt relieved and rushed southwest. The plan was to spend the night in Sankeng, within the territory of Qingyuan-Sihui County. Although it was only a short sixty-li journey, due to continuous labor in recent days, I arrived at dusk. My feet were sore, and blisters had appeared on the soles. After being led into that unbearably dirty inn by the porter, I collapsed onto the bed. After resting for four hours, I still could not restore my energy. In that extremely narrow room, I thought to myself that my physical constitution had never been weak, but I suddenly encountered a relatively difficult life and immediately collapsed. This was indeed a lesson for myself, and for things in general.</p>
<p>Moving forward along the Qingyuan-Sihui Highway, of course, was because it had already been damaged. I set off early in the morning on the 4th. Although I was exhausted, I still had to complete more than eighty li that day. There were particularly many porters coming in the opposite direction along the way. I asked the porter and learned that today was the market day in Sankeng. No wonder there were so many people staying in the inn there last night. He also told me that when the × people occupied Luba, Sihui was in a state of emergency. This highway was supervised by the defense army, and villagers along the road were required to complete the destruction of designated sections within a few hours before H-hour on a certain night, demonstrating the power of the people. The so-called cooperation between the military and the people, working together as one, at this critical juncture, there is indeed a need to go one step further.</p>
<p>The market town of Sihui was also devastated by bombing, and the market situation was bleak. Without intending to, I stayed in an inn. Just as it was beginning to dawn, the waiter woke me up by knocking on the door, because of the fear of air raids. Because of the continuous rainy days, I have not yet discovered any × aircraft in the places I have passed through. Getting up early, if I followed the Sihui Highway directly to Zhaoqing, an important town on the Xijiang River, there would be concerns that the × people would cut off the shortcut from northwestern Guangdong to Hong Kong and Macau. At the very least, it would reduce some of the seriousness. I did not start early on the 9th. On the way to Zhaoqing, because I could not overcome the fatigue of many days, I wanted to hire a sedan chair to travel the thirty-li road in one day. However, the cost was too high, two yuan per ten li. Not only were there too many broken places on this section of the road, but also because of the continuous rain, the large gaps not only required detours, but also many places did not allow the passenger to not jump down, otherwise the sedan chair and the person would fall head over heels, and there would be another misfortune. Therefore, after running sixty li, I stayed in Guangli, which belongs to the fourth district of Gaoyao County. This is a distribution point for goods not far west of the confluence of the Beijiang River and the Xijiang River in Sanshui. Although I often heard the sound of machine guns and artillery fire from the southeast where my heroic self-defense corps soldiers were fighting the × people with the most resolute enthusiasm, the residents were still so calm, doing business, coming and going, and grazing after the autumn harvest, all peacefully spending their original lives. Even though they are like this, what should they do if the enemy cavalry breaks in one day?</p>
<p>On the 6th, I could hire a small boat from Guangli directly to Zhaoqing. Sitting cramped in the boat, the dull sound of artillery fire continued to knock on my eardrums. The standing army of the local self-defense corps divided into five stations for inspection. Because it was not very strict, it did not take much time. In winter, the water level drops. When passing through the Zhaoqing Gorge, the water level during the previous high tide was still high, engraved more than ten feet above the water surface. The wind was very strong, and some of the companions were seasick. The boatman talked to me about this and that with a bitter face. He had rowed to this corner of the Xijiang River in Zhaoqing Prefecture two days before Guangzhou fell. He also said that after the Tax Police Regiment lost the provincial capital, they saw that the social order in the counties and cities near the war zone had changed dramatically. Therefore, some of them were scattered in battle, and naturally there were other elements among them, and they even committed the ugly act of looting compatriots who were seeking refuge. Once, that swaggering platoon leader was reported for taking twenty small packages of local tobacco from a farmer, and was then executed by firing squad. From then on, killing one as a warning to a hundred, coupled with the cessation of hostilities in recent months, the tragic events of turmoil and displacement quickly decreased.</p>
<p>Zhaoqing, which had also been ravaged by × aircraft, was also covered in continuous drizzling rain. It lay quietly and lonely by the river. I also saw barges going to and from Wuzhou braving the smoke and fog. The pedestrians on the river embankment were crowded. Snack vendors were even excitedly doing business in that area. The threat to life forced people to come and go here despite the dangers. And how many travelers trembled before the god of death. Life is meaningless, and they have to desperately fight for this "life." On the morning of the 7th, it rained heavily. I heard that there were still vehicles running from Zhaoqing to Xinyu County. Sure enough, this section of the highway led us directly to our destination. The hundred-li journey took five hours to build. I arrived before noon that day. I wanted to head towards Heping, which was sixty li away, and the road along the Heping pond to Kaiping County was still forty li. However, the porters' asking price was too high, so I temporarily stayed in Xinyu County. The merchants here, like those elsewhere, used greedy eyes to judge whether their trading partners were passing through when purchasing food and lodging. Using national currency as the unit of transaction certainly had opportunities for trickery, and the prices were even higher. They often dared to discount the paper money of the Farmers Bank of China, and even other national currencies were discounted by them, which is extremely hateful. It was also very troublesome not to trade with ten-yuan or five-yuan national currency. This is how ordinary good merchants and those with slight financial power in their operating areas make profits, while the majority of the working people suffer from their writing. In eleven hours, with the pace of a forced march, I completed more than a hundred li of damaged highway in one day. I spent the night in Cangcheng (Kaiping County). I heard that there was an electric boat directly to Macau at Chikan, which was forty-five li away. The journey tomorrow morning would end my walking difficulties. I had a meeting with a friend again in the evening, and I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>After breakfast on the 8th, I borrowed a friend's bicycle, thinking that I could easily reach Yikan, the cultural center of Kaiping, through the slightly damaged highway. How could I have imagined that although this county highway had been demolished by the villagers along the road only in recent days, they had deeply dug up the sand and soil on the roadbed on both sides, so that the smooth and flat road surface was so crowded that those who came and went had to fall into the trap and then climb up to the earthen mounds on the opposite side. Is this seemingly the spirit of sacrificing to the end? I believe that in military terms, when automatically destroying transportation infrastructure that is about to be withdrawn or can be used by the enemy, the first requirement is to reach the military situation where it is necessary to destroy it, and there are also ways to destroy it. It is not necessary to add details here. At that time, using a bicycle as a means of transportation, I was indeed unable to get down or up, my face was full of sweat, and the people who were defending the country along the way laughed. I was to blame and should not complain. And many runners, although they could cross the gaps, all those who fell were seen.</p>
<p>The waterway from Chikan to Sanfu (Changsha belongs to Kaiping, Dihai and Xinchang belong to Taishan) is shallow and narrow. Originally, barges from Guangzhou to Sanfu could not go directly to Chikan to leave. On the 9th, I arrived at the port of Ming. There was an electric boat with a shallow draft that sailed directly to Macau from here. The restaurant charged five yuan, and the cabin charged four, both in national currency. The number of passengers was not too crowded. Originally, it was inevitable that passengers and dreamers would not be able to have smooth sailing. Indeed, when the boat arrived at Yushasha in Zhongshan County, there were many narrow rivers and boats, and the electric boat could not surge forward. So it called for all passengers to transfer to a barge to go. The barge could not move forward either. The passengers who were on the barge advised the passengers to go ashore and cross the shallow and narrow part of the river. The passengers questioned whether there would be a way to continue. They replied that neither the barge nor the boat had anyone in charge. Only by each party paying thirty cents could they attach to other barges to Macau. And they said that if not, it would be inevitable to wait here for several days. The passengers then followed. When attaching to another ferry, the person in charge of the designated ferry actually asked the passengers to sell two yuan of national currency. It was the morning of the 10th, and × aircraft circled overhead, while traitors were defrauding below. The morning of crossing Macau to Hong Kong was the 11th. Those who resided in the counties along the Huangwu Railway mostly had only two ways to go to Hong Kong, one to Shantou and the other to Guangzhou Bay and then to Hong Kong. Many did not know that there was this shortcut.</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Wusong: The Market is Desolate, and Smoking and Gambling are Rampant <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondence] After the × organization of Baoshan established various agencies, the "County Chief" was changed to "Chief of Political Affairs," and Yan Gangru, a native of Beichuan Sha, was appointed. Its name is "Baoshan District Political Affairs Office of Shanghai Special Municipality." Wusong is under the jurisdiction of Baoshan, and the "Wusong Town Political Affairs Sub-Office" was established, with Zhao Xianliang, a native of Beishengjiaqiao in Yuepu, as the "Town Chief." The × "Police Bureau" was also divided by Baoshan to establish the Wusong Sub-Station. It has been in operation for nearly four months. The "Patrol Officer," Wang Qin, is nearly thirty years old, a native of Jiangbei. He previously served as a patrol officer in Shenhang Town, Songnan. It is said that he is capable of extorting and is superior to others. There are more than thirty unarmed policemen in total. Because the people of Wusong heard Japanese officers declare that Wusong is a military area and cannot be officially opened, most of the well-capitalized merchants do not dare to return to Wusong. Only small merchants and poor residents have no ability to maintain their livelihoods outside, so they have to return to Wusong Town. However, the number is very small. In addition to twelve or three small restaurants and tea houses, there are only twenty or thirty other rice shops, sauce and wine workshops, etc. Therefore, the market is desolate, and business is sluggish, not enough to cover expenses. However, smoking and gambling are particularly rampant. There are more than ten swallow's nests and opium dens. The license fee for opium sales and smoking places is ten yuan per month. Opium addicts smoke openly, without any scruples. Tea houses rely on commission gambling as their main business. Mahjong, Twenty-One Points, Pai Gow, etc. are quite lively. In the Jin surname Shikumen house in the Li family's residence in West Road, a Japanese brothel is set up, with full of rouge and powder. Eight Japanese women in kimonos and backpacks are busy entertaining. In the evening, the electric lights are brilliant, and yellow-clothed people come and go in an endless stream. The original site of the Renrentang pharmacy on Tongxing Road is used as a unified canteen. Four Japanese women are responsible for cooking and serving. Sometimes they even sing and drink along. There are also three or four foreign women who have been staying in Wusong for a long time. These people are all yellow-faced and black-toothed, and their opium appearances are exposed. Driven by life, they also pretend to be shockingly glamorous, as tools for lustful slaves to vent their desires, in order to make a living. It is worthy of a sigh. (January 12th)</p>

<p>— Pan Taifeng</p>
<p>And its along-line scenery</p>
<p>Guilin is located in the northwest of the province. The highways starting from here include the Guihuang, Guihe, Guiliu, and Guiyong lines. 1. The Guihuang Line was built in the 15th year of the Republic of China. It travels northwest from Guilin to the Huanghe River on the border of Hunan and Guangxi. The entire line is 100 thirty kilometers long, passing through Luchuan, Rongjiang, and six towns in An, Jieshou, Xianshui, and Quanxian, with a width of 10 meters. It is a gravel road surface with 66 bridges and 730 culverts, all of permanent type. The maximum slope is 6%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 30 meters.

<h3 id="e51">This Year's Financial Situation Becomes More Stable; Developing the Economy of the Rear Area (Part 1); International Balance of Payments Situation Further Improves; Capital Inflows Assist Internal Development <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national financial front has remained stable. Through long-term testing and overcoming numerous difficulties, public and private financial organizations have become increasingly perfect. The people's trust has grown daily. Now, a decision has been made to use its full strength to develop the economy of the rear area, allowing capital to flow inland and assisting in development. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>This Year's Finances Are More Relaxed</p>
<p>The four major banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of China, have joint offices and discount committees in major cities with branches. They handle the discounting and mortgage lending of agricultural, industrial, and commercial bills. This discount method is partly a commercial mortgage loan, but it also has regulations for re-discounting and discounting. Therefore, it also has the function of the central bank regulating finances. Currently, the amount of loans discounted is approximately 100 million yuan. Since its implementation, the national financial situation has been extremely stable. Last year, there were no bank runs or credit crunches, nor were there signs of financial panic. At the beginning of this year, the financial situation became even more relaxed. Therefore, the discount committee stopped direct lending. When needed, the Banking Association applies on behalf of the applicant.</p>
<p>Exerting Efforts to Develop the Economy of the Rear Area</p>
<p>In order to develop the economy of the rear area, the government is encouraging production enterprises to move inland and is also striving to promote the circulation of local finance. Local financial institutions can obtain one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes from the four major banks to assist production enterprises in the interior. The purpose is to encourage financial institutions to invest in agriculture, industry, and mining, in order to correct the past imbalance of focusing on urban finance. It is now decided to (1) encourage exports, facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese, (2) find ways to collect gold and silver, (3) increase the number of local financial institutions, (4) promote thrift campaigns, (5) encourage various types of production, (6) increase agricultural lending, (7) provide credit loans, and (8) train financial personnel. The above items have all been implemented successively.</p>
<p>Particularly Cautious in Issuing Policies</p>
<p>China's legal tender policy had already been successful before the war, and its credibility has increased through the war. The legal tender's cash reserves have consistently been above 60%, while the guarantee reserves have been below 40%. Previous inspections have all been in line with the statutory ratios. As for the issuance limit, at the end of 1937, it was 1,639,098,000 yuan, which increased to 1,726,998,000 in June 1938. The rate of increase is no longer as fast as in the early stages of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the total amount issued increased by 568,979,000 yuan, while in the first half of 1938, the increase was only 87.9 million yuan, which is sufficient to prove the caution in its issuance.</p>

<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] "The emotional relationship is about to end, counting the days until spring arrives, may I ask the healthy athletes of the football kingdom, will you be surprised that time passes easily?</p>
<p>A beauty since ancient times is like a famous general, not allowing people to see her white hair." It is the same for those who compete on the football field, but who can maintain their youth forever and avoid aging?</p>
<p>Today is the start of the Li Hua Cup football preliminary round, with the Western Staff United team and the Army United team facing off. The game kicks off at 3:30 PM at the Kowloon field.</p>
<p>Before 1936, the Western team was at its peak, winning the championship seven times. However, after 1936, due to the scattering of talented players from the Western team, their dominance completely disappeared, and they no longer looked down on everything.</p>
<p>Although the current Western team representatives are said to be outstanding, the overall strength of the team is actually insufficient compared to the Army United team. Therefore, I don't think the Western team has the look of a champion. The Army United team has won the championship consecutively and still has strong ambitions. Moreover, this time, the selection is unique. The central defender Pi Yaxun is not used, and the defender Bi Tidi is not selected. Instead, they appreciate those outside the usual picks, selecting Dun from the military supplies and Yong Stanli from the Fifth Battalion Artillery.</p>
<p>The art of war says, "Observe what is not yet formed, see what is not yet completed, and you will win every battle." With such a selection method, the Army United team must have a well-thought-out plan.</p>
<p>A message to the fans: if you want a good show, please arrive early. But a reminder: do not bring children, and do not scalp tickets outside the venue. Each spectator may not purchase more than three tickets. The lineups for both teams are as follows (Football Field God):</p>

<p>(Special Airmail Report from Saigon, 15th) This time, the South China team traveled a long distance, fighting five games in a week. Facing famous teams, they won every game, showing invincibility. However, after a break following the game against the South Ky United Team B last night, the battle against the United Team A resumed today. After a short rest, their physical strength had not recovered. To lead a tired army against a fresh team is a dangerous move for experienced strategists. The United Team A is composed of the elite of this area. Taking advantage of this weakness, they attacked with force. Although the South China team members have an indestructible body, their strength will eventually be exhausted. Even tigers take naps, inevitably being taken advantage of. Unfortunately, they lost due to a penalty free kick, losing three to one. As Mr. Li Foye said, "We are not made of iron," which is truly not their fault in battle.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM this afternoon, the Stone Stadium was already full. Because the United Team is one of the strongest teams here, fans knew there would be a fierce battle. The number of Chinese, French, and Vietnamese spectators totaled over 10,000, unprecedented.</p>
<p>With the sound of the silver whistle, the game began. The United Team attacked like tigers, their three armies rushing forward, attacking the South China side with swift and decisive strikes, shooting as soon as they arrived. Fortunately, South China goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai was agile, catching a "fancy ball." The United Team failed to capitalize and continued their attack. Players from both sides fought fiercely, shooting repeatedly. Zhang Rongcai caught them all, turning danger into safety. Li Tiansheng waved his weapon and was able to drive the enemy out of the area. The South China team immediately counterattacked, but the United Team continued their relentless attacks. After several battles, Li Zhaorong managed to receive the ball and shoot, but it flew into the air. Several attempts to score failed due to bad luck. Chen De'an fired up this time, taking advantage of Feng Jingxiang's pass, shooting from a distance that was difficult to score. The United Team seized the opportunity, intercepting the ball. The right winger immediately rushed up, passing three defenders. The ball was as fast as an arrow, shocking the spectators. It seemed certain that a goal would be scored, but Zhang Rongcai jumped and caught the ball, saving it from going in. It can be said that this ball was extremely dangerous. It is a pity that every time he catches a dangerous ball, he kicks it out without considering the surrounding enemies, allowing them to attack again. This negligence should be paid attention to in the future. Therefore, the United Team came back and attacked continuously. Li Tiansheng had the responsibility to defend the territory, heading the ball to clear it. However, the danger was not yet over. Another counter-attack was launched, finally stabilizing the situation. However, the South China team was too civilized, and their tackling was not strong enough, often being robbed by the opponent's skill. Before long, they were forced to a corner kick, but it was unsuccessful. Feng Jingxiang immediately launched a counterattack, passing to Liu Songsheng to kick, but it was blocked by a United Team defender. Feng then tried to head the ball, but it was unsuccessful. After much commotion, Li Zhaorong launched a surprise attack from afar, but it was difficult to win. This was really due to the weakness of the central defense line, which was often broken through deep into the territory. At this point, the United Team's counterattack became more intense. Li Tiansheng defended the city with all his might, heading the ball like a bird, which was very exciting. The United Team shot from left and right, but it was difficult to score. Although there are good defenders, there is nothing they can do under the pressure of a large army. Therefore, in the melee, the United Team's right winger (number 10) rushed up, and Mai Shaohan tackled him down outside the goal. In the heat of trying to save the ball, which is common, the referee ruled a penalty two-yard free kick. Of course, he scored, and a round of applause came from one side. (The first half ended, with South China losing by one goal).</p>
<p>After the break, the second half began immediately. The South China team launched a large-scale counterattack, attempting to avenge themselves. Yang Shuiyi stirred up trouble on the border, which could have earned him a high honor, but he was intercepted by the enemy, losing an opportunity in a hurry. However, the Chinese side had a corner kick, and the danger was averted. Feng Jingxiang had a chance to take advantage of. Chen De'an shot, but it was just out of reach, failing at the last moment. The two sides fought harder and harder. The United Team was again awarded a corner kick. Li Zhaorong was angry, but his magic had no effect, and he failed again. Fearing being captured, Liu Songsheng fired from a distance, but it was also intercepted, an extreme misfortune in ball luck. It was a chaotic and dark battle. Li Guowei was forced to bravely fight through, and Feng Jingxiang charged forward lightly. Zhaorong missed another opportunity. The United Team took advantage of this, launching a desperate counterattack. Li Tiansheng could not react in time, and Zhang Rongcai was eager to save the ball, resulting in a penalty free kick outside the boundary, causing a big mistake. The United Team rushed in, and Mai Shaohan was injured and out of the game. In the chaos, he scored a goal, making it three to zero. The South China team was almost shutout. As a result, they put in their best efforts, showing their individual skills. It was a pity that Yang Shuiyi had a good chance but missed it again. After repeated attacks failed, and with songs from all sides, the formation was greatly disrupted. Before long, Yang Shuiyi was determined to go it alone, but he could not get what he wanted. The United Team became more and more unscrupulous, repeatedly trying to invade. Yang Shuiyi had a chance to counterattack, but it failed again. That day, he lost his usual form. The whole team collapsed. He should take responsibility for this. From then on, the overall situation was lost, and it was difficult to turn the tide. Until two minutes before the end of the game, Feng Jingxiang waved his arms and shouted, arousing the spirits. The cavalry rushed forward, passing the central defense. Liu Songsheng took advantage of the situation and rushed forward, breaking the shutout record. However, the time was gone. Although Li Guowei was brave, he only earned a handshake with the opponent's center forward to say goodbye. The silver whistle sounded for a long time, and South China lost three to one.</p>

<p>Entertainment... The Lone Wolf of Paris</p>
<p>The content of a bizarre robbery, the style of comedy and humor, and the layout of the story are quite tortuous. However, many climaxes in the film pass by plainly. It tells the story of a world-famous jewel thief who has already reformed and no longer engages in theft. However, in Paris, he helps a princess of a small country retrieve the pearls of the imperial crown. He uses his empty-handed skills again, cleverly stealing the pearls, and battling wits with the treacherous duke who coveted the pearls. Only when the princess's younger brother is about to ascend the throne does he complete his task in a moment, allowing the young monarch to ascend the throne.</p>
<p>Francis Lederer and Frances Drake are both very competent in this film.</p>
<p>Queen... Color Film Highlights</p>
<p>Walt Disney's pen-and-ink animated films are continued and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." They have received great attention from moviegoers. This "Color Film Highlights" screening selects and assembles his most recent works, totaling ten films, listed below:</p>
<p>"The Fox Hunt," "The Crazy Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Golfing Laughs," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Tales," "The Whale Hunt," "Lucky Day," "The Ungrateful Bull," "Giants' Tale."</p>
<p>The painting techniques of each film, as well as the coordination of colors and tones, are all as perfect as possible. The stories are short, lively, and full of strong interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "The Ungrateful Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Tales," and "Giants' Tale" are particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>Peace... The Mad Miss Manton</p>
<p>A film that combines romance and a mysterious murder case, performed in a humorous and crazy style. Barbara Stanwyck plays a terribly bad socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse. She reports it to the police, but by the time the detectives arrive, the corpse has been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual conduct, people think she is trying to show off and made up a lie. This is obviously a wrong accusation. What makes her even more unbearable is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) satirizes her in the newspaper. So, she gathers a group of sisters to conduct a search. After discovering the second corpse, people sympathize with and believe her, especially the young editor, who gives her a lot of help. At that time, the murderer wants to kill her to silence her, but fortunately, the detectives surround and annihilate the murderer, and she is spared.</p>
<p>The plot of the film lacks some possibility, but due to the excellent performance of the actors, the development of the plot is natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the assassination case is also quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film. Because what is used to attract the audience in this film is not a tense and serious detective story, but a strong comedic interest.</p>
<p>East... White Tiger Demon God</p>
<p>Although it cannot be said to be a poorly made production, it is not particularly brilliant. However, the background and material of the story are more novel and different compared to ordinary beast films. Director Cliff Wyatt has considerable experience in shooting beast films, and the handling of this film is still acceptable.</p>
<p>Dahua... Rose Marie</p>
<p>A musical singing love film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, with excellent performances. When Nelson Eddy goes to capture his daughter, the inner conflicts of public and private matters are handled quite successfully by the director.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Lihua Cup Football Preliminary - Li Huitang's Reason for Helping - Shanghai Telephones Urge Him to Go North to Participate in Charity Match <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The selection of players for the Chinese Football Team in this Lihua Cup match has been greatly affected because many players from the China Education Association’s football team have traveled south to Saigon. This has caused considerable consternation among members of the Hong Kong Football Association. The previously selected lineup for the Chinese team had to be completely overturned and re-selected a few days ago. Many consider this a strange occurrence, but upon closer examination, it is not so unusual.</p>
<p>During the initial selection period, football star Li Huitang, due to an unhealed foot injury, expressed his unwillingness to participate in the match. Subsequently, the Football Association believed that the lineup was insufficient to attract a large audience and considered the failure of Dan Jiang and South China to send several players to Hong Kong as a breach of agreement. At the same time, they earnestly requested that Huitang overcome his difficulties and promised to play in the match. Li, seeing that a simple appearance by him could ease the dissatisfaction of the Association towards his parent club, South China, finally agreed to help. Thus, the team was re-selected entirely a few days ago.</p>
<p>Unable to Refuse, He Reluctantly Takes the Field</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to pass by Li’s residence and inquired about the recent condition of his foot injury and whether he was satisfied with the second selection of players. According to Li, his injury has not fully healed, and he even showed me the marks as proof. His right shin has two bruises, and his left knee has one, all still black and blue. He feels conflicted about participating in the match. If he prioritizes his own well-being and refuses to play, he would be unable to mend the Football Association’s relationship with South China. However, if he plays, his foot injury is not fully healed, and he lacks suitable soccer shoes, making it difficult for him to perform at his usual level.</p>
<p>Upon hearing his mention of lacking suitable soccer shoes, I curiously inquired about the details. He explained, "Whether or not a pair of soccer shoes fits properly has a significant impact on one's performance. Experienced players like you understand this well. The soccer shoes I usually use are currently being used by Liu Qingcai, who took them to Saigon. New shoes cannot be broken in quickly, and finding suitable ones is difficult. It is difficult for me to find a substitute that fits my foot perfectly. I can only hope that Liang Yanzan, who is known for having large feet, has a pair that might fit."</p>
<p>Li added that since his injury during the international match, he has not engaged in any physical exercise to recuperate, so his stamina is definitely not as good as before. Furthermore, since the soccer shoes are not his usual ones, he cannot guarantee his performance will be up to par. The outcome of a soccer match is difficult to predict. He will only do his best. If his performance falls short of his usual standard, he hopes the audience will be understanding and not overly critical.</p>
<p>Finally, I inquired about his opinion on the strength of the second selected team. He replied that he has been busy lately and rarely watches other teams play, so he is not familiar with the skills of the emerging players. However, since they have been approved and recruited by the selection committee, they must possess considerable skill. His only concern is that many of the players have not had the opportunity to cooperate with him before, so there might be some lack of coordination. He does not dare to comment on others, but he himself is worried that the absence of familiar collaborators like Feng Jixiang might hinder his scoring opportunities. If the two inside forwards could retreat slightly and provide timely passes, it might be easier to find openings for scoring.</p>
<p>Li Huitang's Dividing Himself for Multiple Obligations</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Football Association sent a letter to Li yesterday morning, requesting that he definitely participate in the Hong Kong-Philippines inter-port match during the Lunar New Year to represent Hong Kong. At the same time, Huang Jiajun also urged him to definitely help the Chinese football team in the charity match between Hong Kong and the Hong Kong League on February 26th, to increase its appeal. It is said that Li has agreed to appear on both occasions without fail. Unexpectedly, soon after, Lu Ai'yun, Chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Service Group, forwarded a telegram from Sir Zhou Shoushen in Shanghai, urging Li to go to Shanghai during the Lunar New Year to attend a charity event for refugees organized there. The telegram read:</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhou Shoushen,</p>
<p>Shanghai newspapers report that Li Huitang is strongly urged to come to Shanghai to participate in the charity match. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>We have scheduled the match for February 20th. Please have Mr. Li depart on that day. We look forward to his arrival. Li Gui, Shanghai National Relief Association. After receiving the telegram, Li, seeing that the Shanghai match and the Hong Kong international match are on the same day, found it difficult to fulfill the Shanghai request. He also has the charity match on February 26th, and needs to be in Hong Kong, it is impossible for him to be in Shanghai until after February 26th. Therefore, he has asked Sir Zhou to reply to the Shanghai organizers and request that the Shanghai charity match be changed to March 4th, so that he can be in Shanghai. It is said that postponing the Shanghai match would slightly affect revenue. (Old Companion of the Football Field)</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Experience of a Slave of a Vanquished Nation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Tian</p>
<p>Flipping through old books, I found "The Northern Sketches of the Late Ming Dynasty," which contains much that is worth reading. For example, there is a passage in Volume 1 under "The Fall of Liaoyang" that records the painful experience of the people of a conquered nation, which stirs up endless sorrow when read. I copy it below:</p>
<p>"In the seventeenth year of Shunzhi, a student from Liaoyang named Yang served as the governor of Songjiang. He and Liu Guoyuan, a Jinshi from Wuxi, were drinking and watching a theatrical performance. When the wine was flowing, Yang slapped the table and shouted, 'Stop! It's wrong!' Liu asked, 'Does the old governor have a deep understanding of ancient laws?'</p>
<p>Yang replied, 'My life was also spared by luck. In the initial fall of Liaodong, fearing that the poor would rebel, they first arrested and killed the poor. Two years later, fearing that the rich would gather and cause trouble, they killed them all again, sparing only the four classes of people. The first class were leather workers who could make good shoes; they were spared. The second class were carpenters who could make utensils; they were spared. The third class were needleworkers who could sew fur hats; they were spared. The fourth class were actors who could sing Han songs; they were spared. They especially wanted to kill scholars. At that time, I was a student, eager to make progress, and I was studying behind closed doors, so my face was rather plump and white. I was arrested and asked, 'Are you not a scholar?' I replied, 'No, I am an actor!' Actors must be good at singing. Try singing!' So I sang a 'Siping Tune,' and I was spared.'</p>
<p>After Yang finished speaking, he personally tapped the table and sang a song at the banquet before stopping."</p>
<p>Few people know about the misery in the occupied territories today. But in the four northeastern provinces, which fell eight years ago, it has indeed reached the stage of dividing people into four classes. What is strange is that in today's Easternized lands, not only the scholar class is being attacked, but even the working and peasant classes with a slight sense of national identity cannot escape. For example, today the Japanese in the Northeast divide the people of the Northeast into four classes: A, B, C, and D. Class A refers specifically to intellectuals. Class B refers to middle-class people who have surrendered and become puppet officials. Class C is for workers, and Class D is for ignorant farmers. Among these four classes, the most dangerous and least protected are the A class. Not only is this the case in normal times, but on household registration books and travel permits, the three words "Class A People" are clearly printed as a sign of strict prevention. This is the same as the passports of Jews expelled from Germany, which were stamped with "Jew." However, the words "Jew" themselves are not an insult or danger to the Jews themselves, but only an annoying mark. But "Class A People" clearly tell you: "This is an anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo ideological offender," and their life will be erased sooner or later. But recently, because of the prevalence of anti-Japanese sentiment and the intensification of X-people's oppression, even Class C and Class D people have mostly embarked on the path of actually resisting and attacking the enemies. For example, the Northeast Volunteer Army, which is rampant in various parts of the Northeast today, is mainly composed of the northeastern peasant and worker masses. This is one example. From this, it can be seen that the oppression of Manchuria in the past was not as fierce as the current torment by the X people.</p>
<p>What is strange is that Yang, a student from Liaoyang, although he once deeply tasted the bitterness of being a slave of a vanquished nation and hated it all his life, in the end he still threw himself into the arms of his master and got a governor to do. He is just a scholar, a petty bourgeois intellectual. In any era and environment, he can get an official position. Although "loss of integrity" is a big deal, "starvation" is also a big deal. This is why in the occupied territories today, only ignorant and uneducated common people are seen rising up and attacking the enemy, while few scholars die for their principles or intellectuals sacrifice themselves. For example, in the vast occupied areas of the Northeast, only Zhao Laotaitai and her son and others destroyed their homes to resist the enemy. There are also the former "Ma Huzi" who occupied the mountains as bandits, uneducated peasants and workers. If someone asks, "Where are the intellectuals?" there is no follow-up. Perhaps those intellectuals are just waiting for the National Army to counterattack! But they are all eating the invaders' feasts, smeared with oil, and becoming instructors or special agents in puppet official positions. A scholar is just a scholar, and it is the same in any society!</p>
<p>For example, recently there are some "plump-faced" people who actually join hands with the enemies to slander the government and the people resisting the invaders. This is truly the ugliest and most shameful thing in the world. If heaven has no justice, and their bird plan is realized, of course they will be officials and nobles again. Scholars are shameless, and it is mostly like this.</p>
<p>The pain of being a conquered nation does not seem to cause any obvious suffering for some people. These people should be sent to the nineteenth level of hell to be slaves of a conquered nation for eternity, never to be able to turn over, as their deserved punishment.</p>
<p>In these days when "selling out the country is not shameful, and traitors are everywhere," those who have never tasted the bitterness of being a slave of a vanquished nation should be vigilant!</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>I was secretly wondering what caused their kind of character and thinking, because it wasn't just Mr. Yu and his son, but all the men there. When you talk to them, they all have a pure neck that is different from the ordinary people, and even the women have their own opinions. This small mountain village is not accessible to culture, and transportation is inconvenient. How could they know so much about things outside? For example, they said:</p>
<p>"More than 20 young people from villages within ten miles of here have gone to school in northern Shaanxi."</p>
<p>Why do they know to run so far to go there, and isn't the young man in front of him saying that he will leave soon? What kind of power is pushing them? There is also a woman who guards a son in two rooms, and also let the child go. The way she talks is not like ordinary women wiping their eyes and shedding tears, but rather a smile floats on her face, as if that matter makes her glorious - what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Looking at the fields nearby, looking at the high mountains in the distance, I was really troubled that I couldn't understand it myself. In frustration, I said something like: "This area is really a place to fight guerrilla warfare." After I finished speaking, I also pointed to the towering mountain to the east.</p>
<p>"That mountain below is Linjia Dawan, Lin Biao's old home!" People said in unison, looking at them like they were excited, "He is the principal of Anti-Japanese University!"</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Yu, as a pioneer, stretched out his hand to indicate that area of hills, drew a semicircle, and then explained:</p>
<p>"That area is where the Red Army used to appear. How can it not be a good place to fight guerrilla warfare!" He smiled, "Now, we ordinary people can also talk about these things with you soldiers. Before, we couldn't."</p>
<p>This time, I completely recognized the people in this small village. Influence, ah, influence, it's all because of that aspect that influenced them. According to them, the Red Army first went down the mountain to attack, occupying the village stronghold twice. They accumulated several years of experience, and they also had a new understanding of the Red Army. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Escape <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Du Wenhui</p>
<p>It was a late autumn night, and the dark sky was still shining with countless stars. Our 913th Regiment headquarters, with more than a thousand brothers, had already set off for the middle section of the Guangzeng Highway - villages near Longyandong - to be stationed.</p>
<p>This hasty march in the middle of the night has made the team feel unusually tired. The advance troops have already made contact in Zengcheng, ninety miles away. The deep sound of cannons is constantly drifting from the night sky, and each of our hearts is constantly beating, disturbed by the unpredictable fate of death. Even if our sleepy eyes have already closed, we are still pricking up our ears, quietly listening to what is happening in the night sky. If there are one or two barks of dogs or some footsteps, we will uneasily open our eyelids and look out of the camp.</p>
<p>The sky has not yet dawned, and a ray of dawn is emerging from the gray sky. We were sleeping soundly in our dreams when we suddenly heard a rattling sound of X-planes in the sky. We hurriedly got up and put on our clothes, and rushed out of the village to the fields and mountains to hide.</p>
<p>"Rumble, rumble..." The sound of explosions began to echo through the earth's space and people's hearts. In the dim dawn, bombs fell like baskets of black eggs. The entire village and the jungle along the highway turned into ashes, all emitting rushing flames!</p>
<p>The bombs not only wanted to level those villages, but also the mountain forests along the highway.</p>
<p>"Kakaka..." The sound of machine guns swept around us. More than a dozen of us desperately climbed up the mountain peak. When we climbed to the top of the mountain, only I, four soldiers, and a staff member named Chen were left.</p>
<p>I looked back and saw that in the distance on the highway, there were already more than a dozen black tanks rushing over, as if they were entering a no-man's land.</p>
<p>The plane was sweeping machine guns overhead, and bullets danced in the wind around us. We desperately ran down the hillside and ran over another mountain. At this moment, I only knew about life, regardless of thorns or shallow pits in front of me, I took the road when I saw it, and climbed the mountain when I saw it. After running for more than two hours, I couldn't hear the sound of the machine guns, and I couldn't see the shadow of the enemy plane.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sky had dawned. The colorful sunlight had shone on our backs, on the haggard valley, and on the hazy sky. The morning light in winter was lovely and bright, and lovely and warm. The six of us sat on a rock in a forest to rest. Everyone's legs were swollen. Our hearts were beating non-stop like ants on a hot pot. The whole night of escape had made our faces pale. Everyone was unwilling to talk, only deep in our hearts were some torrents of grief echoing, and we fell asleep tiredly in the jungle.</p>
<p>The small birds in the forest were chirping and singing lovely little songs on the peeling dead branches, as if to comfort the hardships of us fleeing people.</p>
<p>When we woke up from our sleep, the sun had already set in the west. A golden yellow of the setting sun was softly lying in this green forest. At that time, we felt very hungry. However, where can we find some food in this wild forest? So we decided to move towards Guangzhou again.</p>
<p>When we were about to reach the boundary of Henan, it was already dusk. Looking from afar, Guangzhou and Henan were emitting rushing flames, and black and white smoke was filling the entire space. We knew that the X army had entered Guangzhou. If we move forward again, we will definitely encounter danger. In the absence of a solution, we had no choice but to run to Foshan while enduring hunger.</p>
<p>We completely threw our guns in the wilderness. We ran all the way from Xiaogang to Foshan in the dark night. After a night of constant running, we finally arrived in Foshan when the east turned white. Several of us rented a room, ate breakfast in the town, and ran back to the hotel to sleep. That night, the four soldiers parted ways and went home. Only I and the staff member Chen stayed there.</p>
<p>The next morning. Chen and I set off to leave Foshan for Macau. On the road from Foshan to Guanshan, several bandits holding pistols robbed us. Our money was all searched. Fortunately, the five silver dollars in my shoes were not searched, otherwise we would have starved to death on the road.</p>
<p>After many hardships and difficulties, we finally arrived in Macau, found a relative, borrowed 20 dollars, and escaped back to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In these ten days of wandering, hunger, and fleeing, it was the most unforgettable page in my life history. The cruel behavior of the X-people is something I will never forget! One day, I will swear to avenge this!</p>

<h3 id="e66">Beware of the Enemy's Divisive Tactics <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Cheng</p>
<p>In the newspapers of the enemy and the traitors, there is constant propaganda about shameless and absurd "anti-communist theories" – this is the most self-satisfied cover-up used by the traitors and their masters. Of course, this cover-up cannot deceive the Chinese people who have 18 months of experience in resisting the enemies - good men who have grown up in this world. However, there are still some stupid fools who have been fooled and are following the monsters to talk nonsense, saying a lot of inappropriate things such as "disbanding the Communist Party, abolishing the border areas, reorganizing the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army." This is completely the enemy's divisive tactic of using traitors. They didn't even look at whether the existence of the Communist Party, the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area and the Hebei-Shanxi border area, and the existence of the Eighth Route Army have helped the war of resistance against the enemy or hindered it over the past 18 months? Hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members are engaged in the most arduous anti-enemy activities in the enemy's rear. Hundreds of thousands of armed forces are under the leadership of the cadres of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, containing hundreds of thousands of the enemy's troops, and firmly holding on to the base areas in the enemy's rear without retreating. In the administrative work of the border areas, whether it is the universality and improvement of the democratic system, the implementation of mass anti-enemy education, arming the masses, or mobilizing the masses, all have played a model role in the country. Only the blind and the deaf do not know that there are such iron facts. These facts, could they be used as a reason to disband and abolish these organizations? Even the Japanese warlords cannot but admit that the existence of these organizations is the greatest threat to them. Why should we remove these threats for the enemies? I really don't understand why these people always have such free time and strange intentions to calculate these meaningless old accounts?</p>
<p>However, those things are always the easiest to distinguish. The enemy's anti-propaganda cannot deceive anyone for a long time. If you still don't believe it, then please look at two different news items published in the newspaper a few days ago at the same time: just when Peng Dehuai, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, visited Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions and rushed back to the Shanxi front to participate in the victory celebration meeting of the soldiers and civilians in Shanxi, the new traitors who advocated anti-communism were secretly meeting with Japanese representatives.</p>
<p>In this year of ever-changing, hypocritical, and deceptive times, it is still necessary to be careful: recognize the facts more, believe the rumors less; not to mention political vision, in short, this is also the duty of being a human being.</p>
