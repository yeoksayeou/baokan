<h3 id="c1">祝中美文化協會的成立 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中美文化協會巳於廿二日成立於重慶，這雖然只是民間團體的一種，但其意義之重大則有深刻認識之必要。</p>
<p>先自一般文化協會的意義言，它的第一作用是在溝通兩國或一般世界的文化，聯絡兩國或兩國以上國民的感情，使兩國或兩國以上的國民充分發揮「互助」的効用。文化協會的第二作用是在於對外的宣傳。普通對外宣傳的方法約有兩種：其一是政府機關直接對外進行的正面宣傳，其二是民間團體以溝通文化聯絡感情的名目進行的側面宣傳。論其效用，後者遠勝於前者。國際的宣傳若帶上了政府正面的招牌，接觸宣傳的人首先必持提防及懷疑的態度，任何種宣傳就不容易發生效力。文化協會是出發於友誼與文化，所以宣傳對象容易接受，對於所接受言論必能相信。日本平時卽很注意這一點，所以他們的帶國際性的文化團體，非常之多：除一般的普遍的文化團體而外，還有許多日本與特定一國或一地方的特殊文化團體。前者的例子有如「海外敎育協會」，「國際文化振興會」，「善鄰協會」，「大亞細亞協會」，「東亞同文會」，「東亞調查會」，乃至「大東文化協會」等等，都是主要的；後者，僅就對中國之部分言則有「囘敎文化協會」，「北支那協會」，「中央滿蒙協會」，「中日滿協會」，「日滿文化協會」，「日華學會」等等，爲數廿幾種；其對各國的文化協會，名目更多，例如「關西日意協會」，「神戶日伯協會」，「暹羅協會」，「日英協會」，「日印協會」，「日法協會」，「日美協會」，「日美文化協會」，「日墨協會」，「日土協會」，「日匈協會」等等，上自英美法蘇德意等大國，下至歐美及亞洲各小國或殖民地，也都設有此類文化宣傳的團體。日本自中日大戰爆發後，政府正面的宣傳，如親善使節的派遣失敗後，卽積極運用這些民間的文化團體作國際的宣傳，其效力是不可忽視的。但是我們自己呢，不但這類的文化團體爲數甚少，大部分並且是乂人主動的中日文化團體。故自抗戰以來一些其他各國的文化協會，開始組織成立，尤以中蘇文化協會，最爲各方所重視，可證我國政府及人民於溝通民族情感建立國際文化團體之重要，已有相當之認識與努力。</p>
<p>其次，就中美兩國的關係考察，中美文化協會實在格外的重要。第一因爲美國是中國最親睦國家之一，美國人民對於中國抱極大的關心與同情。第二因爲中美兩個國家的利害關係是息息相關着，美國在中國以及太平洋各方面有着極大的權益，所以中國之受害，實際上也就是美國本身之打擊。第三，中國與美國都是民主的國家，民間的輿論可以左右各自政府的對外政策，而使中美兩國的關係，永遠圓滿親善。這次中美文化協會恰又成立於太平洋的海盜積極侵略中國因又損害美國以次各國權益的時候，其對於民主各國團結一致制裁破壞世界和平及太平洋均勢的國家，必定有極大的裨助。在這次中美文化協會成立過程中，我們還可以看到幾樁特別可喜的事實；其一是「九一八事變」以來主張世界正義及制裁强盜最力的史汀生先生充當該會的名譽會長；其二是最能了解美國並得美國人民崇信的蔣委員長夫人也被選爲名譽會長；其三是現任行政最高當局的孔祥熙院長充當會長，對於中美兩國政治，经濟及文化的互助，當可發揮極大的力量；其四，還有不少主張抗戰最力的先進，如孫科院長，及孫總理夫人等被選爲理事，當能促美國積極贊助我們的「正義之戰」。</p>
<p>不過，中美文化協會剛剛成立，此後如何發展，能否照我們的希望作去，能否對於我們這次的「義戰」發生正當的意義和積極的作用，還要等待後來的事實來證明。我們切望：凡參與中美文化協會的人士，都要站穩國家民族的立塲，務使這個協會的眞正使命充分完成。我們記得國內許多的文化團體，常鬧內部爭奪的問題，卽國際文化團體也未有能例外的。這是中美文化協會負責者應加戒愼的。我們還希望着中美文化協會同類的國際文化團體，如中英文化協會，中法文化協會等，也能够應目前的需要而產生。</p>
<h3 id="c2">怎樣紀念『三八』婦女節？ <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 安妮</p>
<p>『抗戰以來，中國婦女組織起來，直接參加抗戰工作，對抗戰的確盡了不少的力量，不過，比起在前綫拚命犧牲的百數十萬的男孑來，中國女孑全體所負的責任還是不平均。須知道我國婦女要爭取自由解放，一定先要與男子共同爭取民族國家的自由解放才行，在今日，國際上平等是男女平等先决條件。』</p>
<p>——何香凝先生對今年三八節談話——</p>
<p>（一）三八節的歷史意義</p>
<p>一九〇九年三月八日，美國的勞動婦女，曾經舉行一次要求自由平等的示威遊行。一九一〇年，社會主義婦女大會在丹麥國的哥本哈經開會。世界婦女運動的偉大領袖克拉克，蔡特金女士，特提議規定三月八日這一天爲國際婦女節日，獲得一致通過，以後每年的三月八日，各國婦女界莫不舉行盛大紀念，其主要用意就在於檢討過去一年婦女運動的成績，計劃今後婦女運動的方針與具體辦法，以爭取婦女的解放。</p>
<p>我國婦女運動過去具有光榮的歷史，近年響應國際婦女節日，全國各地，均曾舉行盛大的紀念。以求中國婦女的解放。不過中國婦女正處在雙重壓迫之下，正在國內封建勢力傳統惡習和國際×國主義尤其是法西斯侵略者的雙重壓迫與殺害之中。這種實際情形又决定了中國婦女除了一般的婦女自求解放的任務之外，還有更迫切的更艱苦的任務，這個現階段中國婦女解放運動的任務，就是要和國內封建殘餘勢力與傳統的腐敗的思想習俗，作殊死的鬥爭，同時還要和國際的×國主義尤其是法西斯侵略者，作殊死的鬥爭。</p>
<p>（二）新形勢下的三八節</p>
<p>新形勢下的今年，一九三九年的三八節，具有其新的特殊的意義。</p>
<p>從國際方面講，今年是兩條陣綫戰爭發展到更高階段的一年，是法西斯的侵略陣綫和民主的和平陣綫閒戰鬥更顯明更激烈的一年。一方面是日德意等法西斯的侵略者，在慕尼黑會議到西班牙戰事激轉以來英法妥協政策的鼓勵之後，在他們狡滑嚇詐和瘋狂冒險政策獲得成功之後，正在加緊他們本身之間的勾結，正在醞釀擴大反共協定爲使略軍事同盟，正在積極擴大戰爭的一切凖備，正在民主和平國家的國外和國內燃放戰爭火藥，企圖把分散在各地的第二次世界大戰統一起來和擴大起來，使一切愛自由愛和平以至全人類感到空前的大戰的威脅。另一方面，是民主的和平各國，以社會主義建設正在順利完成的蘇聯爲首，在法西斯侵略者的瘋狂放火挑戰之際，展開了更廣大更堅强的反法西斯反侵略戰爭的鬥爭。美國的人民和政府，已經繼續着成爲這個鬥爭裏面的重要力量，英國法國，也在共產黨和一切進步政黨正義人士的號召與領導之下，發動了和擴展着偉大的羣衆鬥爭。尤其是西班牙中國人民反法西斯反侵略的鬭爭，日德意反動統治營內反法西斯人民陣線的鬬爭，發展了民主的和平的正義的力量，决定了法西斯的侵略的暴力壓迫的違反人道的勢力必將總崩潰的命運。</p>
<p>我們中國，四萬萬五千萬人民，在革命的政黨和進步人士的號召領導之下，在國際的指導和各國政府與民衆的同情援助之下，反對日本法西斯侵略爭求中華民族解放與世界和平的戰爭，已經英勇支持了二十個月—團結統一的青春的強壯的進步的新中國，已經在這二十個月的鬥爭中長成起來；相反，我們×人日本侵略階層的貧乏，困難，衰落，退化，以及內部分裂外國反擊的危機，亦每我們二十月英勇鬥爭中暴露出來。我們×人已經陷落不可挽救的泥潭，而我們則正從艱苦中向勝利光明幸福之途邁進！</p>
<p>新形勢下的三八節，兩條戰綫激烈戰鬥之際的三八節，我們抗×戰爭英勇鬥爭了廿個月少後的三八節，由于世界和我們中國婦女界已經英勇參加了所有這些戰鬥，我們婦女界楚可以誇耀的！我們婦女界是應該更加虛心誠意地接受過去英勇鬥爭的經驗敎訓，是應該更加認潰與担負起我們解放自己解放民族和解放全人類的責任來了！</p>
<p>（三）今年紀念三八的任務</p>
<p>然而我們同時應該指出：在國際，法西斯侵略者的嚇詐與冒險，正在加緊進行，新的大戰正在加倍擴大和殘酷的演進中，而英法等國的統治者還一貫地推行其偽善，怯懦，妥協的政策，正在增加人類與和平的威脅；同時和平陣線上的主力軍與領導者，各國的勞苦大衆的統一和團結，尙不够新形勢的新要求。倘便我們人類半教的婦女不能在這時積極地參加到民主和平陣線上去，推進反法西斯反侵略戰爭的鬥爭，則這種鬥爭絕無成功的希望！</p>
<p>同時在中國，抗戰二十個月以來，雖然表現了全國空前的團結和政治上長足的進步，然而由於我國經濟的特點，由於領導抗戰建國的最大政黨國民黨階級的特點，和共產黨力量的尙嫌薄弱，由於抗×民族統一戰綫的依然不够鞏固和擴大，由於封建殘餘買辦階級的繼續作惡，由於漢奸親日份子失敗主義者在國內國外繼續活動，更由於日本侵略者繼續從我國內國外策動其「反共停戰親日」的攻略，决定了我們抗戰的必須經過艱苦悠長奮鬭的特性，决定我們抗戰建國途中遭遇不斷的陷阱與襲擊的必然性，在這艱苦悠長的戰鬥過程中，如果沒有我們二萬萬二千五百萬的婦女參加，則我們的戰爭。絕無勝利希望，而我們婦女本身亦將永遠去失從雙重壓迫與危害下解放出來的機會！</p>
<p>怎樣議我們全世界的婦女，在當前兩條戰綫的鬥爭中，完成我們偉大光榮的使命呢？我們最緊急主要的任務就是：加緊我們全世界婦女的團結，從英美法蘇各國，建立鞏固和發展婦女界的統一戰綫，成為國際反法西斯反侵略戰的主力軍。特別是號召與領導反法西斯反侵略鬥爭的第三國際第八次大會就要在這幾天召集，對於接受過去經騐敎訓和發展今後鬥爭爭取更大勝利，將有極重要的决議，只有我們全世界愛自由愛和平愛正義的婦女大衆，立即準備忠誠的擁護，才能最後完成我們在這個時代的偉大的使命。</p>
<p>怎樣讓我們全中華民族的婦女，在雙重壓迫之下解放出來呢？怎樣讓我們全體婦女成爲完成推進抗戰主力軍和建國的工程隊呢？最主要最緊急的仍舊是建立鞏固與發展我們婦女的統一戰綫。我們從過去二十個月服務抗戰的經騐教訓中知道，如果我們二萬萬二千五百萬女界同胞不能團結起來參加到抗戰建國每一部門的鬥爭綫上，則抗×民族統一戰線就不能鞏固與發展，而在世界的意義上，則就是反法西斯反侵略鬭爭的不能勝利，就是中國和世界婦女以至全人類的解放，將成爲不可能！</p>
<p>（四）中國婦女的具體工作</p>
<p>我國英勇抗戰的二十個月中聞，婦女大衆無論在前綫在後方在淪陷區以至在一切特殊地區，都曾盡了相當偉大的力量，都曾建樹非常光榮的功績，打破了過去輕視婦女力量侮辱婦女人格阻碍婦女解放的頑固思想腐惡勢力，同時開朋了中國婦女擺脫一切枷鎖担負偉大使命爭取幸福生活的光明坦道。然而從全中國婦女人數來看，英勇參加這種光榮鬥爭的婦女，它竟還只佔最少數，在各地農村裏，工廠裏，職業界，學校裏，和一切家庭中，仍有最廣大多數的婦文沒有組織起來，團結起來，而已有的婦女組織，亦仍缺乏聯系，因此實際工作還遠趕不上新形勞的新要求。</p>
<p>朋以我們今日最主要最緊急的具體工作，第一還是婦女界的大團結。首先是把已經組織起來的各地婦女團體，組織成全國性的統一戰綫，各地婦女團體首先就應成立所在地區的統一的組織；其次是擴大宣傳動員工作，發動與組織各地各界婦女，參加到團體裏面來，參加一切抗戰建國工作，爲本身為民族爲世界的自由而努力奮鬬。在這統一戰綫的奮鬭中，我們特別要注意幾個基本的原則，一是當知民族利益高於一切，同時民族利益與婦女本身利益是一致的；，二是當知互助互讓的美德；三是展開抗×大目標下的善意的工作競賽和工作上思想上的批判精神，因爲唯有實錢這些基本原則，婦女統一戰綫才能鞏固與發展。</p>
<p>其次急待我們努力去做的是擴大服務傷兵工作。二十個月來英勇抗戰中我們對此會有重大的成功，特別是在台兒莊以及其他重大佻勝利之中，都應該把婦女方面的功績大寫特寫，但是我們的抗戰是長期的，我們服務傷兵的工作將日趨重要與困難，我們過去所能做的固然還多爲時間與地域所限，廣大傷兵多呻吟畢命於無人照顧之中，今後這種現象將更趨嚴重，這是我們所不忍亦不容輕視的！今後我們要擴大宣傳，擴大組織，大規報而且經常的發動傷兵慰勞傷雎服務運動，在統一的有組織有計劃的推行之下，建立千萬個傷，醫院和俱部樂的組織，特別是在海外華僑中間我們婦女界要担負起更重大的責任來。</p>
<p>第三，是救濟難民的工作，我們不僅應該繼續完成正在進行中的一切救濟難民的步驟，使各地難民獲得必要的衣食，同時我們還必須努力於難民力量的集中發動，我們要負担起敎育及組織難民的實任，使廣大多數的難民，都能積極地參加到抗戰建國的每一工作部門裏去。</p>
<p>第四，是要保護與教育我們的後代。現在我們已經成立戰時兒童保有會，我們應該建立或充實發展各地的分會。我們要使戰區流亡逃難到各地的兒童，獲得撫養與敎育，我們要使後兒童獲得「兒保會」的教育，不致牽制了他們父母的參加抗戰革命的工作，大時代的小兒女們，甚我們革命抗戰的後備軍與革命建國的主力軍，我們要特別認清這一工作的重要與偉大，我們要使每一個不能到前綫去的家庭婦女參加或援助這一偉大的工作。</p>
<p>第五，我們要慰問及組織出征軍人及陣亡將士的家屬，愛載，尊敬，慰問他們，帮助他們解决一切問題，並且組織她們到抗日民族統一戰線上來，和我們共同担負起服務傷兵工作，募捐宣傳工作和當前十二分鐘要的推進工役運動一元還債運動等等。</p>
<p>第六，我們要加聚國防宣傳工作，特別是將日本侵略者在中國摧殘文化蹂躪婦女屠殺羣衆的×行，用實際資料，向國際作普遍深入的宣傳，喚起國際上對我更大的同情與援助。我們可以用種種辦法完成這個重大的任務，如利用私人關係向外國友人作個別的詳細的報吿；如將向各國婦女團體及文化社團報告，如推派代表到各國去宣傳，如發動華僑婦女代表進行宣傳，如向各國報章雜誌投稿，如以各國語言廣播，如要求國際婦女在三八節日發起援助中國週，如要求各國女記者和各國記者團來華視察等，都應依客觀環境及自己能力，努力推進。</p>
<p>第七，現在我國婦女組織如國民外交協會的婦女工作委會，中國婦女慰勞會，女靑年會，婦女生活社及各地婦女團體，應該一致祖負經起常進行民衆宣傳與國際宣傳的任務，而與中宣部各地報章雜誌保持密切的聯系。</p>
<p>第八，我們鑒於過去二十個月的英勇鬥爭，曾經一再遭遇親日漢奸，民族叛徒，失敗主義，頑固份子，以及封建殘餘和買辦階級的阻礙與襲擊，而且這種阻礙勢力與襲擊危機，依然嚴重存在與潜伏發展着，我們婦女更應認淸自身在雙重壓迫危害之下的特點，而加緊團結與這種障碍勢力與腐惡份子作殊死的鬥爭！特別是和日×漢奸正在加緊策動中的「反共停戰親日」陰謀，作殊死的鬥爭！</p>
<p>第九，鑒於法西斯侵略者內外危機的嚴重，可以預料今後×人作戰，必然更將暴露其冒險性與殘酷性，瘋狂轟炸與濫放毒氣，將作爲主要的武器，而其對象，則以後方民衆爲主。民　　　要加緊爲援助我國充實空防和捐助防空毒防物品的運動。</p>
<p>最後，我們還必須經常認眞推進婦女自我敎育與幹部訓練工作，我們對於婦女工作的幹部和各界婦女，應該多開時事座談會，戰時工作訓導班，戰時社會政治文化研究班，以及關於動員婦女爲反法西斯抗戰建國的而奮鬬自我駁育組織。</p>
<p>（五）紀念「三八」的方式問題</p>
<p>紀念去年三八節日前數日，我國婦女領袖史良，沈茲九，陸慧年等曾特開座談會，當時决定的紀念方式，似仍可以做我們的參考，現在附錄在這裏：</p>
<p>一，召開廣大的婦女羣衆大會，邀請各階層的婦女——家庭婦女，職業婦女，女學生，工廠女工，農村婦女等參加，在各地普遍舉行。</p>
<p>二，進行慰勞傷兵慰問難民的工作</p>
<p>三，舉行一分錢募捐運動，向每二婦女募捐一分錢，一方面可以匯集來進行慰勞工作。同時可以表現婦女的力量。</p>
<p>四，每個婦女團體發動徵求會員運動，使每個婦女團體能在『三八』節後，增加一倍以上的會員。</p>
<p>五，各報紙各刊物各書店發起優待婦女讀者運動，尤其是舉行婦女刊物賽籍的賤售與展覽。</p>
<p>六，舉行「三八」游藝大會，集欵進行慰勞慰問工作。</p>
<p>七，請各報章難誌出「三八」節特刊。</p>
<p>八，廣播『三八』紀念歌。</p>
<p>九，在『一二八』節日正午十二時起，靜默五分鐘，以表示全國婦女對于陣亡將士及死難同胞的哀悼。</p>
<p>十，各婦女團體向最高領袖蔣委員長及前綫抗戰將士献旗劍，以表示全國婦女一致　護最高領袖領導全國團結抗戰爭取最後勝利。</p>
<p>我們這褽還應該一述的，第一，是團結持久抗戰國策，踴躍參加一元還債運動，一方面表示婦女對于政府的忠誠擁護，另一方面則向國際表示中國婦女對於反法西斯反侵略的忠誠參加，第二是在國民參政會方面，我們婦女界應該作進一步的奮鬥，爭取婦女在參政會的地位與提高今後婦女在政治上在社會上的地位。（完）</p>

<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>——浙主席黃紹雄訪問記——</p>
<p>【本報桂林航訊】歷史告訴我們，浙江自古就是一個報怨復響，重振邦家的根據地。</p>
<p>袛要稍事獵步中國古代史的人，他一定能道出當年吳越在目今江浙兩省的興亡盛　的故事。這故事，在史家的巨筆下，構成一冊民族和國家的最偉大完美的敎本，幾千年來，常給宇內的被壓迫民族和國家作爲前車之鑒，後事之師。</p>
<p>東戰塲自×人席捲京滬杭三角地帶，我軍據錢塘江南岸堅守以來，相持已一年有餘。這之間，×人圾初因爲戰略上的關係，最後爲了實力不够，使這方面的戰事入於半眠狀態；我方則乘機整軍經武，生聚敎訓，宛若勾踐自姑胥台畔被樺歸來時的　國。當時越國國境：北起海鹽，　達姑末（衛縣），東全　甬（　海），西迄携李（嘉興），這縱橫八百里的領土，也和現在第×戰區在浙江方面的縱深牌地和游擊區域相當。而×方的情形和我方的對策，更和　蠡對勾踐所說：「謀國破敵，動觀其符：今吳乘諸　之威，以號令天下，不知德薄而恩淺；道狹　怨廣，權懸而智衰，力竭而威折，兵敗而軍退，士散而衆解。臣請按師整兵，待其敗壞，隨而　之，兵不血刃，士不旋踵。吳之君臣爲虜矣。臣願大王匿聲，無見其動，以觀其靜。」不謀而合。當筆者在桂林訪晤浙江省政府主席黃紹雄氏，暢談浙江省政後，覺得中日前途，實有步入吳越醫史的趨向　可能。</p>
<p>越王勾踐的臥薪書胆，深謀積盧，雖是滅吳復國的原因之一；但他假如沒有「明而知內」的范　和「遠而見外」的文種兩位重臣，給他在政治上以英大的臂助，那麽。吳王夫差是否會對他「肉袒膝行」的問題，恐誰都難下肯定的答覆。因此爭取政治上的勝利，實在是獲得軍事上的勝利的先决條仲。浙江遠處×人後方，雖有被×人包圍攻擊的危險，却也有奮起突擊，一舉成功的使利。國人爲求提早實現最後的勝利，對浙江省政無不寄予深大的關切與期望。黃紹雄氏昔主內政，今掌符浙，他的苦幹實榦的精神，久爲各方屬目。從他的談話中，我們不僅可以瞭然於浙江的現狀，且可求得勝利的徵兆。</p>
<p>浙省政治是隨着局勢的演變而進展的。目下省政向着（一）自衛動員，（二）兵役，（三）財政動員，（四）改良農村機，（五）物產調整，（六）交通統制等六項目標前進。內中除（二），（五），（六）三項，都已順利推進外，「自衢動員」，「財政動員」和「改良晨村機構」三項，尤具成績。</p>
<p>「自衛動員」就是發動武裝民衆。使民衆自動武裝自己在消極方面保衛村鎭縣區，積極方面直接參加民族解放的戰爭。現在浙江共有民槍××萬枝，除村鎮各具自衛武力外，每縣有自衛團×營，每區有自衛團×團。且巳能集中使用。雖然因此不免稍增人民的負担，却都得大衆的了解。這種龐大的民衆武力，在未來的大反攻中，是掃蕩摧拉的急先鋒，當貧婪的×人欲再深入浙江內地時，也將成正規軍的大帮手，合作地阻擊和殲滅×人。</p>
<p>『財政動員』的口號是「有錢出錢」，但並不一定叫某人出錢。浙江的富庶之區在嘉湘杭當，全面抗戰四　月後，便先後陷落了。這淪陷的十三個縣份，雖僅及全省七十五個縣份的六分之一弱，在浙江的財政預算上，不能不說是一個甚大的損失。經過一度整理，爲肅淸中飽，加增消費稅率等後，財政收人，反較原有收入增加達五分之一。因此，浙江省歷年度從未超過三千萬元的預算，今年度一躍而突破四千萬元。這一財政上的奇蹟，不僅在說明過去所謂廉潔政治只是一個動人的口號，也給各省財政　局一個示範；同時吿訴國人：我國的政治並不是一沒辦法」而是一沒辦法」而已。</p>
<p>最值得注意的是「改良農村機構」這一種工作。浙江省區縣各級政府現都附設有「政治工作指導室」。訓練大學或中學畢業的靑年，從事對民衆進行宣傳，解釋和推進政府法令的工作，他們的地位是處於政府和民衆之間，作爲政府和民衆的媒介。目下在全省各區縣工作的，不下四千餘人，平均浙江每一萬人民中，便有政治工作人員二人。他們的工作原則是「集中運用」和「分區負責」。每月工作三星期，訓練一星期，也就是在不斷的學習工作，實騐和改良之中，可說是一種最好的敎育方法和工作方法了。</p>
<p>至於淪陷區方面，因爲×人目下不僅無法擴大戰區，甚且無法保持原佔領地，各地縣政，進行如常。中央原有淪陷區免收租稅的明令：但浙江省政府方面覺得向政府納稅是人民的義務之一。亦爲構成國家的條件之一，爲使淪陷區人民不忘對國家應盡的義務，不致泯滅國家觀念起見，對淪陷區的田畝，目下仍科租稅。只是原來每畝收一元有餘的，現在僅徵大洋一二角。此外並有政工大隊×隊，常川在淪陷區域中巡迴工作。</p>
<p>温州海口×尙未能封鎖。現爲沿海貿易及交通的唯一孔　，從上海經此轉浙贛路輸入內地的日用品非常擁擠。過去難免無×貨在滬改裝牌號，由奸商混運內地漁利者，現自温州至金華之間，設有專司檢查此項×貨的關卡七處，如有發現，卽予沒收。但恐仍難絕跡。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c17">衡陽的救亡運動 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>衡陽各界抗委會徵募傷兵棉殺公演的第三天。承該會負責人劉啓迪君，及軍委會政治部電影放映第一隊指導員老友高摥兄邀約，前往參觀，夜晚七時左右，會塲中早坐滿了觀衆。頃刻宣布開幕，節目計有下列各項：</p>
<p>首先是四十九師政治部同志合賽粤曲，音調有時非常美妙，有時非常壯烈，　罷三曲，耳際餘音嫋嫋，眞有「繞樑三日」之慨。</p>
<p>第二幕，是上海宋志元君的「鋼絲拉戲」，無　那一齣戲的生丑凈旦的唱訽，他都能用那股單絃鋼絲拉奏出來，好像聽留聲機樣的極其相似。後來因為聽衆要求「再來回」，他又另外拉出「鷄呌」「狗吠」「狗打架」「軍樂隊高奏而過』的幾種音調，都非常逼眞動人。</p>
<p>第三幕，是軍委會政治部抗×演劇隊第八隊演「我們的國旗」；劇情中有個女孩子將漢奸父親挿在門上的日本旗掣下撕碎，另換上我們那美麗的『靑天白日滿地紅』的幽旗時，觀衆會不約而同的一致立起來，好像行升旗禮時一樣的向它致敬！</p>
<p>第四幕，是四十九師政治部同志演「死裏求生』。換通一次幕，接着也是該部男女工作人員，合唱了幾個救亡　；唱到悲壯處，唱的人固然聲淚俱下，聽的也把手巾摸出來揩眼睛；　　，全塲不期然而然地靜默了一會，自然，這是大家精神交流薈萃的一種反映。</p>
<p>最後一幕，又換第八隊表演「囘山」；這是說明大別山脉里的一部份民衆，於戰事他移後，下山來想過他們夢幻中的「太乎日子」，但是被盤踞該地的×人，抓壯丁，派軍米，搜拿花姑娘等暴行，騷擾得鷄犬不寧，家破人「瘋」，於是復興『回山』之念，走上「去當游擊隊」的生路。這故事是現　資料，演員表情，又是「爐火純靑」，所以劇演完了好一會，觀衆還在默想中而不離座。</p>
<p>今晚表演得最精彩的第八隊，它的前身，是上海　劇救亡協會演劇隊第八隊。自八一三抗戰開始後，上海話劇界一共組織了十三個救亡演劇隊，分發前綫或後方工作，第八隊便分發到安徽去了。</p>
<p>該隊成立之初，人數甚少，經費完全是隊員們自己捐逗。出發工作的路線，幾乎走　皖境大江南北的　要　市，到處做演劇，口頭及文字的一般救亡宣傳工作。統計在皖境被宣傳的民衆，約遠五十萬人，幷根據鮮沽的現實資料，創作新劇本九個，迭經表演，都能　得一般的好評。</p>
<p>他們在桐城工作的時候，正値徐州合肥相　失守，便和當地公私救亡分子，加緊做運輸米鹽，組織農民協會等，以作建立游擊工作的基礎；不料時間爭取不够，楓城失陷，截斷歸路，便把他們通進大別山脉里去。</p>
<p>旣而轉道武漢，光陰眞快，囘首八一三組隊之初，恰已工作了一年。就在這八月間，得與其他有工作歷史及經驗的劇團，一致改編而隸屬於軍委會政治部系統之下，該隊旋被派來湘工作。</p>
<p>該隊現有男女隊員人數，按政治部規定名額，共計三十人。中有中小學敎師，大中學生，新聞記者，公務員，商人等，來路雖不一致，但爲了大家救亡目標齊一，工作努力，所以編作和表演起戲劇來，却非常調協，有力而動人。客觀方面，在目前好像有什麼期待似的一般觀衆，也正需要灌輸以這樣的救亡認識及方法，這當然會玉成　作者及表演人的意外收獲，乘時努力吧，「般戲劇宣傳者，努力！</p>

<p>— （董平改譯自本港士蔑西報）</p>
<p>研究過心理學的人，大概都知道一自賤心理』這個名詞。所謂一自賤心理』，說得嚴格點，便是一種失去了自尊心，而不信任自己的病態；它形成的原因固有不同，但其所引起的後果却是一樣，永遠不圖上進。</p>
<p>「自賤心理」幷不只限於個人，常常有許多國家也患有『自賤心理』的：嚇詐，殺戮和爭鬥，便是它最顯著的症狀。</p>
<p>如果一個國家在不知不覺中患上了這種病症，那是很危險的；自然，假使誰能够先見及之，而加以褐發和糾正，在其國家本身上說，總是件無上的收搜。</p>
<p>在今日的歐洲，便有一個患着「自賤心理」的國家；那就是意大利。同樣的在這個國家中，也有着一個先見的人，在努力根絕他國家的病患；他就是聞名遐邇的意記者蓋達，現任「意大利日報」的生筆。</p>
<p>如果不算太誇張的話，蓋達的文章也許能算是世界上最風行的了，他每天在報上發表的東西，已成了羅爲外國訪員必爭的滋料，在國外，許多民主的報紙上，每天都豋着羅馬訪員的電報，裏面自然又是藍達的宏論，甚至於老看報的人，也能够順手在那一版上找到蓋達的文章。</p>
<p>那倒是事實，蓋達常常是頭一個發表政府消息的人；但實在的，他並不能算得是消息十分靈通的人。在意人利，比他能幹和路道多的記者多的很；他的所以出風頭，完全由於他機警和肯說話。</p>
<p>當他决定這是有利於意大利的話，他立刻便會想盡方法去揚給全世界知道；但對於不利的，他却也抓得挺緊，</p>
<p>在意阿戰爭中，蓋達是特准閱讀馬菲報吿的，那報吿的主旨，是說明阿比西尼亞的英國商人並不反意。蓋達機一動，便把這報吿在自己的報上發表了，以爲可以給英國與論一個打擊。誰知這弄巧成拙，這個反成了英國最好的宣傳，証明英國的主張制裁並不是自私自利。</p>
<p>一般人通常都說蓋達是莫索里尼的代言人，其實，這不完全是正確的。他幷不像一般人所說每天都要和首相促膝暢談，他的主張也幷不完全就是法西斯的政策。</p>
<p>莫索里尼自有他自己的「意大利人民報」。這張報紙完全是莫索里尼自己的，一切由他自己負實經營，蓋達是沒有份的。據說每天夜晚，有一個編輯來把莫索里尼自床上叫起來，和他討論决定明天的報紙；而在這張報紙上，便是莫索里尼常常大放厥詞的地方。</p>
<p>蓋達的消息來源跟他的許多同行一樣，就是意大利外交部。他每天總得七那裏走一趟，由齊亞諸或別的要員竭誠招待。</p>
<p>在意大利，蓋達以一個大　主筆的身份，自然也自有他的特殊地位。雖然如此，他的一切言行，仍不能代表官方的意見。所以，我們說，蓋達旣不是莫索里尼的代言人，也不是意大利人民眞正的呼聲；而實在只是法西斯嘍囉的傅聲筒。</p>
<p>蓋達所代表的，根本不是意大利人民。他永遠是站在法西斯嘍囉的羣中，領導着其他的嘍囉一同吶喊。雖然他明知道意大利力量有限，但他仍竭力宣揚意人利是列强之一。雖然他明知道意大利的殖民地炸彈已經吃得太多了，但他仍拼命鼓吹意大利向外發展。</p>
<p>最近蓋達又胡吹了一陣所謂意大利的「天賦意向」，煽動起如火如茶的反法運動。他在報紙上竭力的鼓吹，意大利人不但不比法國人差，而且有過之無不及，所以，意大利應當自法國攫回一切殖民地。</p>
<p>前面已經說過，蓋達並不曾代表意大利的大部人民，所以他在國內的名氣可並不怎樣響，倒是在國外，頗有赫赫之　，這大約要謝謝羅馬外國訪員的宣揚之功了。</p>
<p>蓋達現年六十五歲。他是意大利北部比得　省人。早年在突尼斯的「郵報」担任外交訪員，曾遊歷德俄多年，精通數國語言，寫了不少著作。十二年前。他離開了「郵報」，而到羅馬扭任「意大利日報」的編輯。這時候，乃給法西斯官方看中，提拔他起來做一架標準的傅聲筒。</p>
<p>在他未加入法西斯之前，他原是個忠實的國家主義者。現在他雖然在法西斯麾下掛着名，但他仍然自成一家，篤信國家主義。此外，在他思想上最引人注意的，便是他劇烈的反和平和反民主的惡觀念。他的一切言行，永遠是自這個惡觀念出發而加以發揮的。</p>
<p>蓋達在意大利是個出色的報人，但在世界上却是民主公敵第一號。</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3 id="c35">英法承認西叛軍政權 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>法外長羅萊於本月廿六日宣佈承認西叛軍佛朗哥政權，英政府亦於本月廿七日正式宣佈承認佛朗哥政府，這件事引起了兩種不同的反響：一種是淺見的悲觀論調，認爲央法政府此舉充分證明了和平陣綫的失敗，今後國際局勢將趨向新的黑暗時代；又一種是盲目的樂觀論者，認爲英法對意德讓步，可爲集中力量以應付遠東危局的徵兆。</p>
<p>然而這兩論調，都只看到事勢之一面而未觀其全貌，結果便不能不是錯誤。我們知道佛朗哥領導的西班牙叛軍及其政權，一方面爲違背全體西班牙人民公患接受德侵略者命令的傀儡，又一方面則爲違背世界正義和平人士之公意，推進世界大戰危機的先錄部隊。所以英法加以承認，結果不僅不能暫時安定歐洲，而且必將更加壯大法西斯侵略者的口胃，加緊歐洲菲洲的攻略；英法决無專力東顧的可能。而且日本侵略者今日在遠東冒險挑釁，亦正是英法在歐洲實施妥協政策的結果，亦正是響應意德在西方新攻略的先聲，可見盲目的樂觀論者所謂英法在西方讓步可以專力應付遠東事變，實屬毫無根據。但是，我們同時還應明白，英伕統治者，承認西叛軍政權，直接遭受惡劣影響的，不是和平陣綫而是英法統治者本身，請看路透社廿六日倫敦電所述，廿六日倫敦民衆集會反對承認西叛軍政權，與警察發生衝突，卽可証明。所以英法統治者承認西叛軍政權一事，實際上將使一切偽善怯懦妥協政策的眞面目暴露無遺，而英法民衆的衆對運動，則將在革命政黨及前進人士的領導之下更廣泛的開展，這是不可避免的事。這種情勢將使反法西斯反侵略的統一戰綫的怒潮更加提高，使全世界被壓迫大衆與愛護自由的和平的人士更加團結，又將證明淺見的悲觀論者毫無根據。</p>
<p>英法統治者承認西叛軍政權，所得的結果，旣不是西方局勢的安定，更不會是遠東侵略者將遭嚴重裁制，唯一的結果將是東西侵略者的更加猖狂，將是世界大戰危機的更加嚴重，同時亦將是和乎陣綫在廣大羣衆的推動之下從更大的艱險中發展起來！</p>
<h3 id="c36">快活谷與般含道 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>這幾天，快活谷人山人海！</p>
<p>這幾天，般含道車水馬龍！</p>
<p>快活谷正在舉行春季賽馬。古時春郊試馬，正是男兒意氣，但是今日賽馬，却是凑熱鬧與僥倖心的表現。我們目睹快活谷「車如蟻陣人如潮」的盛况，不知尙能一想祖國砲火連天哭聲遍野的情景否？</p>
<p>般含道英皇書院英賑分會慕捐委會舉行『慈善賣物游藝會』，居然亦是「塲內五花八門，娛樂與賑難一舉兩得，塲外車水馬龍，熱心人士情緒熱烈。」參予此次盛會的，視諸快活谷的男女們，自應崇高數倍！而快活谷將以少數人的得意忘形，造成數十萬人的垂頭喪氣；英賑　物會則將以少數人的慷慨捐輸安心愉恢，造成了數十百萬難民的歡聲雷動！</p>
<p>然而據最近統計，本港過去一年間僑胞對國難捐款總數祇有百零四萬，而馬票銷路於最近一二月間即達五十六萬四千張！因計我們還要請每一僑胞捫心自問：是否已經克盡天職安心愉快？</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>香港馬會舉辦一年一度的大賽馬，沸　了整個香江，昨天還是衆人注目的打　賽舉行的日期，就更是加倍的熱鬧了，港督羅富國和他的夫人公子，也翩然臨場參觀，這可以說是本年度馬賽最繁鬧的一天了！</p>
<p>天氣是那樣的融和，太陽展露着笑臉還未到十二點鐘，往砲馬地，銅鑼灣的電車。和巴士，座無虛位，很多人在車站上等了，差不多二十分鐘，還是沒法搭車。快活谷中，史是車水馬龍，男女少老，摩肩接踵，相屬拉道。幾座水門汀的看棚，黑壓壓的坐滿人，在跑馬圈草地上的裏外圍，也圍得水洩不通，那　熱鬧的情况，眞非筆墨所能够形容的！</p>
<p>——，鐘聲響處，騎士穿着五色的衣服，挽轡登場，號令一發，馬兒展開四蹄，盡力奔跑，四座觀眾，引領懸望，高喝應鞭；看馬臺上，摩豋貴婦，殷商富戶，更是指手劃脚，口沫橫飛，聚張極了１</p>
<p>時候一分一秒地過去，有人是一帙一帙的鈔票掏出來，有人是一帙一帙的袋農送：快要四點了，塲內外幾萬觀衆的心都在「卜碌卜碌一地跳，看看號碼靑一顆一顆跌出來，圍看的人的臉上更是一陣白一陣，額上還微微的沁着冷汗啊１號碼是跌完了，除了少部份的獲彩者外，大家都呆住了，透着深深的失望的嘆息，</p>
<p>打庇賽的馬兒出動了，場外的觀衆，又是一陣大的騷動。很多人都擠來擠去，像糞虫一般的踴動，爲的是看馬自己彩票的票號。有沒有掛在馬兒上呀。啊！四〇四三……險些中了，眞倒霉了，差一個號碼，便做富翁了，人叢裏一個中年的婦人握着拳頭這樣說。跟着你一言我一語的，園着談起來，大概都是說賣馬票前後的事跡，自然，他們都是非常聰明的，他們雖烈是失望了，但他們會解釋自己說，貧富是注定，而不能强求的啊！</p>
<p>在置幾十萬的彩獎　，包羅了不少血汗的資財，有些人還極力的典借來賣幾條彩票，殷商富戶。更是不消說丁，他們大解荷囊，購賣彩票，會比做任何的事物來得慷慨，聽說一位富富位，賣救國公債，是五百大元，絲毫無爽，面購買馬票獎券則五萬塊錢，卒之，連落第獎也沒有獲中，他不過是付諸一笑，便算了。這倒不能不使人爲之吃驚的，他們爲一己私利的犧牲和勇一般的精神，不能不使人欽佩！</p>
<p>一元的彩票，跟一元還債運動，同一時期舉行，而一元還債運動的成績，還趕上一元彩票十分之一，這不能不敎人嘆氣的。如果大家都能够拿出他們贊一元彩票的熱情，和殷富賽馬博彩的精神，來購銷國防公債，相信港中所有的公債額，不銷一偭月，便完全的銷淸了</p>
<p>最後我們感覺到，我們是中國國民，我們便不能逃出抗戰救亡的戰綫以外，我們拿出資財來購買公債，帮助國家抗戰，不勝似把這些金錢拋　在這些空虛漂渺的賭博中嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c69">三級跳訓練的討論（一） <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>（一）人選問題</p>
<p>三級跳、是跑與跳的連續運動、關于選手的訓練、需注意的事項很多、第一點就是人選的問題、人選是很重要的事情、因爲軀體的關係、可以直接的影響于成績、所以在訓練之先、首要的就是運動　的　擇、而選擇的標準如何、當以該項運動所有的要素來决定、在我個人的經驗、可分爲下列兩點</p>
<p>（一）下肢較長、上體皎矮、腿刀甚大、且有短跑天才的人、</p>
<p>（二）大腿畏而肌肉之收縮力大、小腿短而杠　之力强、大約是善于跳的人、</p>
<p>（二）基本訓練</p>
<p>基本的訓練，無論任何一項運動、都不能缺少的、因爲基本的訓練、直接的可以改良我們的姿勢、和得到體力的增加、經驗動作的熟鍊、間接的就影響于結果——成績、基本訓練、可分爲下列各種、</p>
<p>（一）五十米至「百米的衝刺練習關于這種的練習、很是重要、因爲三級跳、是跑與跳遠的連續運動、所以我們在未訓練跳的以前、一定要有五十米至一百米的鍛鍊、以培養健全的衝力</p>
<p>（二）關於腿力的加力鍛鍊這更是比較接近一些的訓練了、跨步或跳時、對于腿的力量與距離、有重大的關係、我們嬰成績優良、一定要有加力的養成、加力、就是疲　的對像、在應用兩腿的時候、不會感到疲勞、而愈用　覺愉快的象徵、就是腿的加力的養成、關于這種的訓練、當然要在平時多做的彈性的下肢　動、其方式、可自由選擇、不必拘限、</p>
<p>（三）最後姿勢的模倣操Ａ坐于低的塾凳上、兩足向前伸直、足尖向上、兩手向後舉、上體微前傾、這時、兩手用力前揮、上體趁勢向前　、使身體立起、如是、每晨做八至十六數、這個操法做熟了再繼續做第二、、d預備　、兩足並立個兩膝微屈、上調微前傾、手揮後、　心在　、勢必向後倒、刻即兩手揮前、挺腰、兩膝挺直、使重心異前、這時的左足或右足上前半步、以保持身體平衡、這樣每晨做八至十六數、愈跌得低（向後倒）時、然後再起史好、在練習時、最好能够到沙池去實地練習、若爲着環境的限制、在墊上也好、切勿在硬地上地練習、以保向後倒的危險、</p>
<p>（三）起跳與步點的關係</p>
<p>我們應該知道的、是該項運動規則第一點的限制、是起跳板的問題、若要解决這個問題、能得到安全的起跳、非就步點的量度來做工夫不可、步點的測量法如下</p>
<p>（一）由起跳板向外倒量第一步點法這個量法、最好是用個人步度的測量、但測量時、應注意目己所用的是某足起跡、用某足起跳時、即用某足先　起跳板向外跳測（步彥即如正式跑跳一樣）、至相當距離該足落地處、再去半步卽爲第一步點、譬如用右足起跡者、卽用當右足先踏進起跳板、跑至相距離、右足落地處再去半步（因爲正式跑時步度必定極寬）、就是第一步點、不過起跳板至第一步點的長短距離、應以個人的衝刺能大爲限、大約十一米左右，</p>
<p>（二）由第一步點再向外量的八至九步之間、作爲出發之點、其測法與第一步點同、</p>
<p>此步點之測法、及應用、應在平時常常練習順　、以免臨時周章、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c71">在前方 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 頓生</p>
<p>詩歌朗誦運動的討論</p>
<p>詩歌，這大時代的號筒，在抗戰中已經悲壯的在大衆心間響澈着了。它的聲音里迸着紅的血，熱的淚，迸着海潮一般的救亡熱情。它呼　着，它憤怒着，它戰鬥着，抗戰的烽火燒化了它華貴的衣裳。它已　做一關西大漢一和大衆在握手了。</p>
<p>一切服從抗戰，一切都在逐着大時代的脚步向前奔馳。詩歌朗誦運動隨着民族解放的戰爭展開了。在陜北有過破題兒的嘗試，此後，廣州。武漢，……也響應了起來。因爲是嘗試，當然不能太心急去求完美的成果，缺陷可以留給以後的努力去克服。這個運　的本身已經惹起大衆的注意，巳成爲織的事實。</p>
<p>我們十五個，肩着「廣雅文化工作團一的牌子到前方來，想用我們的筆，我們的口，把文化的種子撒播到鄉村，到戰地。我們的隊伍里的份子，是靑年學生，也是文藝工作者。現在，作爲一個戰士跑到前方來工作，自然忘不了自己的使命，和有力的武器——手下的一支　筆。</p>
<p>來到肇慶以後的第三次文藝座談會，是在城外河畔上一個小茶棚里開的，四面的靑山綠水間，我們這十五個開始討論起詩歌的問題，發言，辯論，空氣像河水一樣的活潑。我們决定了幾條大綱，大家一齊忙着下手，把綱目和記得的詩篇油印成一個小册子，我們準備第二天晚上來一個詩歌朗誦運動大會。</p>
<p>傍晚，西天的太陽收了它的餘輝，一個個靑年，文藝愛好者，男的女的，帶着一團喜歡走進來，到七點鐘的時候，小小庭院的地上已經被人排滿了。</p>
<p>可愛的燈火，照着我們這一　在前方戰鬥着的有着女藝興趣的靑年，破天荒的開詩　朗誦運動大會。因爲是第一次，大家都懷着新鮮的趣味，把大綱和詩册分給每一個參加的朋友，他們對着它像對着一張神秘的東西。</p>
<p>在主席致過開會辭後，首由主席先萌誦了自己的一　新詩。空氣立刻活潑起來，大家磕着瓜子，吸着茶在思索着，　聽着。……</p>
<p>第一，先在『時歌，置抗戰中的號角一這個大綱上，作了一番討論，大家一致的承認抗戰烽火把詩歌鍛鍊成了鋼鉄，時代的大手把詩歌推近了大衆。陳腐的，唯美的，頹廢的，全死滅了，詩歌已走上了大衆化的健强的道路。詩歌的朗誦運動便是接近大衆的一道　　。</p>
<p>第二，我們談到朗誦詩的內容形式。都覺得形式要創造，要新鮮，而內容却必須和時　的節拍扣緊，和大衆的生活連繫，和抗戰的現實齊一步調。</p>
<p>第三，在山歌，民謠，鼓詞，小調與朗誦詩的區別這一點上，我們展開了一塲舌戰。有的主張朗誦詩自有其特點，决不能　別的部鬥，混淆，雖然在新的形式未建立以前，可以把山歌小調的形式引來暫用。</p>
<p>第四，談到朗誦詩的方法，多數主張用方言，輔以普　話，遭樣可以收效大些，朗誦者應該帶表情，應該先叫自己和所要朗通的詩情　溶成一片，大家沒有第二個意見。有人提出了化裝朗一誦的辦法，一部份人贊同，另一份部却持着反地的意見，理由是化妝會破壞了詩的氣氛。但是後者終於在一番急烈的論爭後屆服了。</p>
<p>最後一項，是如何展開詩歌朗誦運動。「不放鬆每一個朗誦的機會。一位朋友笑着高呼。大家都笑了。「還有呢」？「還有—多組織詩歌朗誦曾，造成大批幹部。」</p>
<p>大家都默默地承認了這兩個提樂。</p>
<p>「請各位詩壇的先進門，多寫些詩篇？朗誦呵』！是誰又在這麼說了。</p>
<p>結論宣讀過了。幾個寫詩的朋友，用着不同的聲調，姿態和言語朗誦了幾個。，每個人的心胸被打動的在狂跳，每一個靈魂沉醉在詩里了。</p>
<p>散會了，大家懷着依戀地緩緩走開，這時，天上的月亮像燈籲，照着這羣靑年走在歸途上。</p>
<p>附註：上面這一個故事，是筆者月前與師友們在前方的宣傳工作之一。現在，雖則是事隔多時，但我終感到有深長的意味，故特追記之。</p>

<p>— 彭成慧</p>
<p>自從抗戰的炮聲響了之後，香港便成爲避難奢的天堂，許多有錢的人，旣不願到後方去做抗戰的工作，又不願在太陽旗下過　民的生活，因此便不遠千里的　進了這裏的領土。自澳口和廣州失陷以後，來這裏避難的人，就像决堤的洪水，滾滾不息地流進來，在這所謂難民之羣中，有資本家，有商人，工人，學生，以及一般的民衆，除此以外，還有很多，我現在所要說的文藝作者。這裏聽不到凄厲的警報和隆隆的砲聲，看不見悲慘的殘酷的毀滅，代替　些的是爵士的音樂，和一片昇平的景象。有錢的當然盡量享樂，優哉游哉，窮苦的便飢寒交迫踴沛流　。至若一般文藝寫作者，因爲多是中等階級，講生活，說不上盡量享樂，然也不致飢寒交迫，不過他們逗留在此多無固定職業，除了寫作幾篇文章以外，就沒有別的事情。所以他們也會在劈劈拍拍的麻雀聲中，還　他們的大好時光，無聊時候他們也會到燈紅酒綠的跳舞場裏，找尋他們與　的刺激，對于作品方面，我想他們也只能够單憑直覺的想像，作浪漫主義的寫作，打開憲門說亮話，這樣產生下來的作品，我以爲一定很難獲得優良的成就，文　作品，連時代先驅者除了本身藝術的表現外，他實在負有一種宣傳的特殊使命，尤其是在這全民族熱烈抗戰的時候，我雖然不敢贊成白穗豐的高徒，再　爲藝術而藝術的主張，却也不敢同情文藝作家，躱在遙遠的天堂裏過　　廢的生活，寫那些單憑報紙材斜想像出來的東西。我以爲現在是文藝作者發展自己才能最好的時候，他們應該上抗戰的前綫，或者與抗戰有關的後方，去作細心的艱苦的搜覓和觀察，去作實際眞確的經歷和體驗，要這樣，才能忠實止確地反映抗戰的現實，完成作家的責任，而不失去作品本身所負藝術的價値和使命。然而滯留在香港的許多作家，却適得其反，怕辛長苦，不願走上這正確際的道路，而躱在這紙醉金迷的天堂裏，做象牙之搭的好夢，我覺得實在是可惜得很。</p>
<p>芷面衝突的最前綫，迂迴側擊的游擊區，還有延安，那訓練戰門力量的古城，昆明，那充滿朝氣的後方，都是眼前年靑作家最好的去歲。在這些地方，生活是多麼的富有生命，興奮，而且有意義。我並不敢希望他們能够實行某批評家的主張。一手開槍，一手寫小說，也不敢希望他們一定能够產生像馬爾洛，山克爾等的偉大着作，不過在那裏生活，總能够寫得出比較更充實的作品，而對于抗戰的現實自然反映得吏加深刻和淸楚。所以我希望所有滯留在香港的作家都能够毅然的踏上這條進路。</p>
<h3 id="c74">肺痛之話 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 丙辛</p>
<p>近些日子以來，每當伏案寫作的時候，總感到一陣陣的肺尖痛，起先對這種突如其來的痛疼，稍有些驚懼慌恐，但後來淸楚知道是寫作太多太久，是肺部作祟，也就　下了一半的疑懼。</p>
<p>那不是事實麼？有福氣住香港，在桃源上做夢並不算得出奇，出奇的是一個下等難民衣食住旣都不佳，更沒有光朗的太陽照射，與鷄子牛奶牛肉的補養，而不患肺病，才是奇事呢！</p>
<p>昨天同一個朋友談話，無意談到肺病問題上，那個朋友竟是撫着前胸重重地咳嗽了三聲說：「一我早就覺察了，我患了香港病！」</p>
<p>「你怎麼不知好好保養呵？」起先我眞要這樣煞像眞心地叫起來，不過想到他的三層高樓上的陋室，擁擠地堆着破傢俱同大人孩子，和　月只能吃粥的入欵，這一句半帶無情半帶輕謾的假情慰語，我暗暗地嚥住了。反而我哀懇同情地說：一我也是如此呢！」</p>
<p>「呵！是麼？那怎可以呢？」他却驚叫起釆。</p>
<p>「那又怎麼不可以呢？窮苦人的特權就是多享病痛之苦呵！」我說。</p>
<p>「我有一個方法可以療治肺病」！我那朋友慢慢地說着。想他一定又是一般人善於假　安慰人的甚麼牛奶，鷄蛋那一套。但他却認眞地說了：</p>
<p>「有一個方法可以療肺病！就是自信自已沒有肺病，也不疑慮……」</p>
<p>「是這樣子麼？」我問他。</p>
<p>「是呵！我着像我們避難的窮人，只有這個方法不費錢而又易行」！</p>
<p>許久我沉默了。</p>
<p>昨天夜裏突然又感到肺部隱隱作痛，似乎對於立志不信自己有肺病的一僩療治，是強硬地反駁，自己也暗想，既然真有了病，怎能又騙着自己說沒有病呢？根本又推翻了那位朋友的告語。不過除了那位朋友的善意良法之外，似乎再沒有其他的良方了，牛奶，鷄蛋與陽光也不是人人可以亨受的。</p>
<p>我內心裏有一個願望，我無論如何我不能死在肺病上，更不能死在這樂土上，假使肺病之神眞的駕臨在我身上的時候，我願意踏上炮火，死個痛快。動亂時代下的我們，又有甚麼値得多顧忌　慮的，當了食不能飽，衣不蔽體，被視做異容，可厭棄滓濟的時候，肺病之神確是我們的上賓了，不過我不如此想，我還希望我能帶了健康的體軀，再到祖國的懷抱。</p>

<p>窮二集團軍，三十一師王部，在魯北與×作戰時，趁着夕暮，向×人猛撲，變方便展開了極劇烈的肉搏，我方一士兵，奮勇異常，親手殺死倭寇五六名，後來因爲子彈放完了，大刀也砍斷了。腿上並且中了兩粒子彈，身體疲倦得幾乎支持不住了。便　進附近的壕溝裏去，剛將屁股坐下，又有一個人狼狽的跑來也急忙往裏邊藏，我方士兵以爲是自己兄弟，便向裏縮了一縮讓出一點地方叫他蹲下，進來的人也以爲裏面是自己人便坐下了。誰亦不說一句話，過了好覺會外面殺聲平凈下去。後藏來的那個人便鑽出來走了，我方士兵也隨着鑽了出來，走了好幾步，忽然發覺前面的人是一個×人，不是自己兄弟，便悄悄握緊手中空槍，忍住腿部創痛，風馳電掣設地跑上去。向×人劈頭就打。×人「呀」的一聲囫在地上，他也丟掉手中空槍，撲倒地上，兩人扭打成壹團，滾來滾去，互相撐咬，最後×人終被我方士兵活扼死，而我×士兵囘到師部時，渾身衣服全被撕破，鮮血淋漓不止。</p>

<p>— 杜文慧</p>
<p>——紀南路上一個瘟疫的小鎮——</p>
<p>當我坐在那木筏上的東廂裏渡過這最後一倏沙河時，已是夕陽快要西墮的時光了，四個强壯的漢子執着長竿挿在浮着美麗波紋的河水的白沙裏，拚命地向前划着。河岸底靑蒼的白楊正閃耀着夕陽反照底金黃的碧光。一羣羣花鵝在樹蔭下嬉戲着；好像是安慰我們這羣坐在車廂裏的旅客底征途的寂寞</p>
<p>我很感動地望着　淸澈的河水，望着那港遠的天邊的孤桅曝曬在河岸上的破漁網；籃空正掠過一羣山蔴雀，冷靜的兩岸都充滿了秀茂的春色。春囘來了！這是可愛的季節啊！然而現在坐在車廂的我，却是負了救亡重荷而跑上征途的人，這大地的春色對我不過是一種疲憊的慰藉，我沒有一點子留戀的意思，我只在憂疑着那陌生的地土，那前途未可知的艱詎的命運！</p>
<p>我正在茫然的沉思中，車子已離開木筏向着那無盡的黃泥公路駛去了，從化縣到安鋪的路上這算是最平坦的一段，所以車也駛得特別快路兩傍種滿了無數的兩三尺高的矮松柏，車好像在都市的林蔭路上定着一樣平靜一，過了這一帶綠蔭，夕陽的光鑽進東窻，射得乘客的眼請發眩，風馳電馳的走了三十多里，在拐角的地方已露出安鋪東站那雪白的屋脊了，乘客底疲倦的臉上都露着一絲愉快的苦笑。</p>
<p>落了車，拍去身上撲滿的黃土，從車後的行李廂領囘兩個皮筴，一個旅店裏的年靑夥伴跑過來替我拿着，帶我跑出車站的坭路，再轉入士敏土的石街，兩傍都是一些夾色的兩層房子，店舗完全鎖上門，生滿着蜘蛛綱，街道死一般冷寂，顯然這小鎭上的人口一定不會多，不過星宇爲什麼這樣多呢，我好奇地問那同行的夥子。</p>
<p>「你不知道呀！先生。這兒正鬧着一種很快就死的病，』他彷彿很神秘的尖着嘴吧對我說。</p>
<p>「什麼病？什麼病？』我急速地問他，他好像有點恐怖和笨拙，吶喊了半天綫慢吞吞地說着：</p>
<p>「這裏前幾個星期禮死去一百多人，他們死的時候渾身都是黑色，……那可不曉得是什麼病……不過聽人說是由於老鼠太多的緣故吧。每年到這時候那病便發作了。…本來這裏過去是很繁盛的，可是因爲這種關係便顯得冷落了。人們都逃到附近鄕村去。直至過了這節李棧從新囘到鎭上來。這年頭，生意眞不容易做了。不是鬧瘟疫。便是怕盜刦兵災……而且這裏又近海，日本的兵艦常在那兒徘徊，敵機也常到這裏偵察的，在這事做生意眞是枉想了！……」他像很感慨的說着。我望着他底有點憔悴的灰蒼的臉孔，心裏浮動着點同情和恐怖的感覺。</p>
<p>「你在這兒不怕麼？……」</p>
<p>「怕是不怕的，因爲那病完全是在那裏綫有……」他指着我們走過那帶骯髒的黑暗的橫巷裏。「大街是不會有的；不過怕又有什麼辦法呢？這年頭，橫豎死是和家常便飯一樣一唉！……」他很感塲地吁一口氣。</p>
<p>我們已踏進兩旅館的店鬥，坐在帳房裏的掌櫃一見我便站起來很客氣的說着：</p>
<p>「租房呀？先生。很好！很好！帶這位先生上三樓去。」</p>
<p>那夥子托着我們的皮筴，循着木梯直上到最高的一層樓上，放在面南的個房間。那裏有一木板窗，一張舊木床，桌子，面盤架和幾張凳于。我洗完臉，拉開那木板窗于，望出去是一個洋臺，洋台之外是安鋪的公園那一帶葱　的樹林。滿天都是金黃的晚霞，遠處正伸展着無際的果米底靑田，和附近那些黑星脊底，憂欝顏的色，顯出異樣不調和！異樣死寂的意味！</p>

        <h1>1939.02.28</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Congratulations on the Establishment of the Sino-American Cultural Association <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American Cultural Association was established in Chongqing on the 22nd. Although this is only a kind of non-governmental organization, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of its significant meaning.</p>
<p>First, speaking from the general significance of cultural associations, its primary function is to communicate the culture of two countries or the general world, to connect the feelings of the people of two or more countries, and to enable the people of two or more countries to fully exert the effect of "mutual assistance." The second function of a cultural association is in external propaganda. There are generally two methods of external propaganda: one is direct positive propaganda conducted by government agencies, and the other is side propaganda conducted by non-governmental organizations in the name of cultural communication and emotional connection. In terms of effectiveness, the latter far outweighs the former. If international propaganda bears the government's positive sign, those who come into contact with the propaganda will first hold a vigilant and skeptical attitude, and any kind of propaganda will not easily take effect. Cultural associations start from friendship and culture, so the propaganda targets are easily accepted, and they will certainly believe in the accepted remarks. Japan usually pays great attention to this point, so they have a large number of international cultural organizations: in addition to general and universal cultural organizations, there are also many special cultural organizations between Japan and a specific country or region. Examples of the former include the "Overseas Education Association," "International Cultural Promotion Association," "Good Neighbor Association," "Greater Asia Association," "East Asia Common Culture Association," "East Asia Research Association," and even the "Greater East Asia Cultural Association," etc., all of which are major; the latter, only in terms of the part concerning China, include the "Islamic Cultural Association," "North China Association," "Central Manchuria-Mongolia Association," "Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Association," "Japan-Manchuria Cultural Association," "Japan-China Society," etc., numbering more than twenty kinds; the cultural associations for various countries have even more names, such as the "Kansai Japan-Italy Association," "Kobe Japan-Brazil Association," "Siam Association," "Japan-England Association," "Japan-India Association," "Japan-France Association," "Japan-America Association," "Japan-America Cultural Association," "Japan-Mexico Association," "Japan-Turkey Association," "Japan-Hungary Association," etc., from large countries such as England, America, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy, to small countries or colonies in Europe, America, and Asia, all have established such cultural propaganda organizations. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan, after the failure of positive government propaganda such as the dispatch of goodwill envoys, actively used these non-governmental cultural organizations for international propaganda, and its effectiveness cannot be ignored. But what about ourselves? Not only are there very few such cultural organizations, but most of them are Sino-Japanese cultural organizations initiated by others. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, some cultural associations of other countries have begun to be organized and established, especially the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, which is most valued by all parties, which proves that our government and people have a considerable understanding and effort in communicating national emotions and establishing international cultural organizations.</p>
<p>Secondly, examining the relationship between China and the United States, the Sino-American Cultural Association is particularly important. First, because the United States is one of the most friendly countries to China, and the American people have great concern and sympathy for China. Second, because the interests of China and the United States are closely related, the United States has great rights and interests in China and the Pacific region, so China's suffering is actually a blow to the United States itself. Third, China and the United States are both democratic countries, and public opinion can influence their respective governments' foreign policies, so that the relationship between China and the United States will always be satisfactory and friendly. This time, the Sino-American Cultural Association happened to be established at a time when pirates in the Pacific were actively invading China and damaging the rights and interests of the United States and other countries, which will certainly be of great help to the unity of democratic countries in sanctioning countries that undermine world peace and the balance of power in the Pacific. In the process of establishing this Sino-American Cultural Association, we can also see several particularly gratifying facts: one is that Mr. Stimson, who has been the most vocal in advocating world justice and sanctioning robbers since the "September 18th Incident," serves as the honorary chairman of the association; the second is that Madam Chiang Kai-shek, who best understands the United States and is trusted by the American people, was also elected as honorary chairman; the third is that the current head of the executive authority, President Kong Xiangxi, serves as the chairman, which can exert great power for the mutual assistance of Sino-American politics, economy, and culture; fourth, there are also many advanced people who advocate the most vigorous resistance, such as President Sun Ke and Madam Sun Yat-sen, who have been elected as directors, which can promote the United States to actively support our "war of justice."</p>
<p>However, the Sino-American Cultural Association has just been established, and how it will develop in the future, whether it can go as we hope, and whether it can have a proper meaning and positive effect on our "righteous war" this time, remains to be proven by later facts. We earnestly hope that all those who participate in the Sino-American Cultural Association will stand firm on the position of the nation and the country, and strive to fully complete the true mission of this association. We remember that many cultural organizations in the country often have internal disputes, and even international cultural organizations have not been able to make an exception. This is something that those responsible for the Sino-American Cultural Association should be cautious about. We also hope that international cultural organizations of the same kind as the Sino-American Cultural Association, such as the Sino-British Cultural Association and the Sino-French Cultural Association, can also be produced according to the current needs.</p>
<h3 id="e2">How to Commemorate the "March 8th" Women's Day? <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Annie</p>
<p>"Since the War of Resistance, Chinese women have organized and directly participated in the work of resisting the war, and have indeed done a lot of work for the war. However, compared with the hundreds of thousands of men who are desperately sacrificing on the front line, the responsibility borne by all Chinese women is still uneven. It must be known that if our country's women want to strive for freedom and liberation, they must first strive for the freedom and liberation of the nation and the country together with men. Today, international equality is a prerequisite for equality between men and women."</p>
<p>——Madam He Xiangning's remarks on this year's March 8th Festival——</p>
<p>(1) The Historical Significance of March 8th</p>
<p>On March 8, 1909, American working women held a demonstration demanding freedom and equality. In 1910, the Socialist Women's Congress was held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The great leader of the world women's movement, Ms. Clara Zetkin, specifically proposed that March 8th be designated as International Women's Day, which was unanimously approved. Since then, every year on March 8th, women's circles in various countries have held grand commemorations. The main purpose is to review the achievements of the women's movement in the past year and plan the direction and specific methods of the women's movement in the future in order to strive for the liberation of women.</p>
<p>The women's movement in our country has had a glorious history in the past. In recent years, in response to International Women's Day, grand commemorations have been held throughout the country in order to seek the liberation of Chinese women. However, Chinese women are in a state of dual oppression, being oppressed and killed by domestic feudal forces, traditional bad habits, and international ×ism, especially fascist aggressors. This practical situation also determines that Chinese women, in addition to the general task of women seeking liberation, have more urgent and arduous tasks. The task of the Chinese women's liberation movement at this stage is to fight to the death against the remaining feudal forces and traditional corrupt ideas and customs in the country, and at the same time to fight to the death against international ×ism, especially fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>(2) March 8th under the New Situation</p>
<p>This year's March 8th, 1939, under the new situation, has its new and special significance.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, this year is a year when the war on the two fronts has developed to a higher stage, and it is a year when the battle between the fascist aggression front and the democratic peace front is more obvious and more intense. On the one hand, the fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, after being encouraged by the Anglo-French appeasement policy since the Munich Conference and the sharp turn in the Spanish war, after their cunning intimidation and crazy adventurous policies have been successful, are stepping up their collusion, are brewing to expand the anti-communist agreement into a military alliance, are actively expanding all preparations for war, and are setting off war gunpowder at home and abroad in democratic and peaceful countries, attempting to unite and expand the scattered Second World War, making all freedom-loving and peace-loving people, and even all mankind, feel the unprecedented threat of war. On the other hand, the democratic and peaceful countries, led by the Soviet Union, whose socialist construction is progressing smoothly, in the face of the fascist aggressors' crazy arson challenge, have launched a broader and stronger struggle against fascist aggression. The people and government of the United States have continued to become an important force in this struggle. Under the call and leadership of the Communist Party and all progressive parties and righteous people, Britain and France have also launched and expanded a great mass struggle. In particular, the struggle of the Spanish and Chinese people against fascist aggression, and the struggle of the anti-fascist people's front within the reactionary ruling camps of Japan, Germany, and Italy, have developed the forces of democracy, peace, and justice, and determined the fate that the violent oppression and inhuman forces of fascist aggression will inevitably collapse.</p>
<p>Our China, with its 450 million people, under the call and leadership of revolutionary parties and progressive people, and with the guidance of the international community and the sympathy and assistance of the governments and people of various countries, has bravely supported the war against Japanese fascist aggression and striving for the liberation of the Chinese nation and world peace for twenty months—the united, unified, youthful, strong, and progressive New China has grown up in these twenty months of struggle; on the contrary, the poverty, difficulty, decline, degeneration, and internal division and foreign counterattack crisis of our × people's Japanese invading class have also been exposed in our twenty months of heroic struggle. Our × people have fallen into an irreparable quagmire, while we are moving from hardship to the path of victory, light, and happiness!</p>
<p>March 8th under the new situation, March 8th during the fierce battle on the two fronts, March 8th after we have bravely fought against the × war for twenty months, because the women's circles of the world and our China have bravely participated in all these battles, our women's circles can be proud of! Our women's circles should more humbly and sincerely accept the experiences and lessons of the past heroic struggles, and should more deeply understand and shoulder our responsibility to liberate ourselves, liberate the nation, and liberate all mankind!</p>
<p>(3) This Year's Tasks for Commemorating March 8th</p>
<p>However, we should also point out at the same time that internationally, the intimidation and adventures of fascist aggressors are intensifying, new wars are being doubled in expansion and cruel evolution, and the rulers of countries such as Britain and France are still consistently pursuing their hypocritical, cowardly, and compromising policies, which are increasing the threat to mankind and peace; at the same time, the unity and solidarity of the main force and leader of the peace front, the working masses of various countries, is still not enough to meet the new requirements of the new situation. If the women of half of humanity cannot actively participate in the democratic peace front at this time and promote the struggle against fascist aggression, there is absolutely no hope of success in this struggle!</p>
<p>At the same time, in China, although the War of Resistance in the past twenty months has shown unprecedented unity and considerable progress in politics, due to the characteristics of our country's economy, due to the characteristics of the ruling class of the Kuomintang, the largest party leading the War of Resistance and nation-building, and the still weak strength of the Communist Party, due to the still unconsolidated and expanded anti-Japanese national united front, due to the continued evil deeds of the feudal remnants of the comprador class, due to the continued activities of traitors and pro-Japanese elements at home and abroad, and even more due to the continued plotting of the Japanese aggressors from home and abroad to implement their "anti-communist armistice pro-Japanese" strategy, it is determined that our War of Resistance must go through arduous and long-lasting struggles, and it is determined that our path of War of Resistance and nation-building will inevitably encounter constant traps and attacks. In this arduous and long-lasting battle process, if there is no participation of our 225 million women, then our war will have no hope of victory, and our women themselves will also forever lose the opportunity to be liberated from dual oppression and harm!</p>
<p>How can we ask the women of the whole world to fulfill our great and glorious mission in the current struggle on the two fronts? Our most urgent and main task is to intensify the unity of women all over the world, and from countries such as England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, establish, consolidate, and develop a united front of women's circles, and become the main force in the international anti-fascist and anti-aggression war. In particular, the Eighth Congress of the Third International, which calls for and leads the struggle against fascist aggression, will be convened in these few days, and will have extremely important resolutions on accepting past experiences and lessons and developing future struggles to win greater victories. Only when the masses of women all over the world who love freedom, peace, and justice immediately prepare to support it loyally can we finally fulfill our great mission in this era.</p>
<p>How can we liberate the women of our entire Chinese nation from dual oppression? How can we make all our women become the main force to complete and promote the War of Resistance and the engineering team for nation-building? The most important and urgent thing is still to establish, consolidate, and develop our united front of women. We know from the experiences and lessons of serving the War of Resistance in the past twenty months that if our 225 million female compatriots cannot unite and participate in every department of the War of Resistance and nation-building, then the anti-Japanese national united front cannot be consolidated and developed, and in the world sense, the struggle against fascist aggression cannot be victorious, and the liberation of Chinese and world women, and even all mankind, will become impossible!</p>
<p>(4) Specific Work of Chinese Women</p>
<p>During the twenty months of our country's heroic War of Resistance, the masses of women, whether on the front line, in the rear, in the occupied areas, or even in all special areas, have made considerable great efforts and have established very glorious achievements, breaking the stubborn thinking, corrupt evil forces that despise women's strength, insult women's personality, and hinder women's liberation, and at the same time opening up a bright road for Chinese women to get rid of all shackles, shoulder great missions, and strive for a happy life. However, judging from the number of women in the whole of China, the number of women who bravely participate in this glorious struggle still only accounts for the smallest number. In rural areas, factories, occupational circles, schools, and all families, the vast majority of women are still not organized and united, and the existing women's organizations still lack contact, so the actual work is far behind the new demands of the new situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, our most important and urgent specific work today is still the great unity of women's circles. The first is to organize the women's organizations that have already been organized in various places into a national united front. Women's organizations in various places should first establish unified organizations in their respective regions; the second is to expand propaganda and mobilization work, mobilize and organize women from all walks of life in various places to participate in the organization and participate in all the work of resisting the war and building the country, and strive to fight for the freedom of themselves, the nation, and the world. In this struggle of the united front, we should pay special attention to several basic principles: first, we should know that national interests are above all else, and at the same time, national interests are consistent with the interests of women themselves; second, we should know the virtues of mutual assistance and mutual concession; third, we should carry out benevolent work competitions and a spirit of criticism in work and thought under the great goal of resisting ×, because only by practicing these basic principles can the women's united front be consolidated and developed.</p>
<p>The second urgent task we need to work hard to do is to expand the work of serving the wounded soldiers. In the twenty months of heroic War of Resistance, we have had major successes in this regard. Especially in Taierzhuang and other major victories, the achievements of women should be highlighted. However, our War of Resistance is long-term, and our work of serving the wounded soldiers will become increasingly important and difficult. What we have been able to do in the past is still limited by time and region. A large number of wounded soldiers groan and die without anyone to take care of them. This phenomenon will become more serious in the future, which we cannot bear and cannot be ignored! In the future, we must expand propaganda, expand organization, and launch large-scale and regular movements to comfort wounded soldiers and provide service. Under unified, organized, and planned implementation, we will establish thousands of organizations for hospitals and clubs, especially among overseas Chinese. Our women's circles must shoulder greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>Third, is the work of relieving refugees. We should not only continue to complete all the steps of refugee relief that are currently in progress, so that refugees in various places can obtain the necessary food and clothing, but we must also strive to concentrate and mobilize the strength of the refugees. We must take on the responsibility of educating and organizing refugees, so that the vast majority of refugees can actively participate in every work department of the War of Resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Fourth, is to protect and educate our descendants. Now that we have established the Wartime Child Protection Association, we should establish or enrich and develop branches in various places. We must enable children who have been displaced and fled from the war zones to various places to receive care and education. We must enable children in the rear to receive the education of the "Child Protection Association" so as not to restrict their parents from participating in the work of resisting the war and revolution. The small children of the great era are even our reserve force for the revolutionary War of Resistance and the main force for revolutionary nation-building. We must especially recognize the importance and greatness of this work, and we must enable every housewife who cannot go to the front line to participate in or assist this great work.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must comfort and organize the families of the soldiers who have gone to war and the fallen soldiers, love, respect, and comfort them, help them solve all problems, and organize them to come to the anti-Japanese national united front and jointly shoulder the work of serving the wounded soldiers, fundraising propaganda, and the currently twelve-minute important work of promoting the labor movement and the one-yuan debt repayment movement, etc.</p>
<p>Sixth, we must intensify national defense propaganda work, especially by using practical materials to widely and deeply publicize to the international community the × conduct of the Japanese aggressors in destroying culture, ravaging women, and massacring the masses in China, and arouse greater sympathy and assistance from the international community for us. We can use various methods to complete this major task, such as using personal relationships to give individual detailed reports to foreign friends; such as reporting to women's organizations and cultural associations in various countries; such as sending representatives to various countries to publicize; such as launching representatives of overseas Chinese women to carry out propaganda; such as submitting articles to newspapers and magazines in various countries; such as broadcasting in various languages; such as asking international women to launch a China Aid Week on March 8th; such as asking female reporters from various countries and reporter groups from various countries to come to China for inspection, etc., and should strive to promote it according to the objective environment and their own abilities.</p>
<p>Seventh, at present, Chinese women's organizations such as the Women's Work Committee of the National Diplomacy Association, the Chinese Women's Comforting Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Life Society, and women's organizations in various places should unanimously assume the responsibility of carrying out regular public propaganda and international propaganda, and maintain close contact with the Central Propaganda Department and newspapers and magazines in various places.</p>
<p>Eighth, in view of the fact that our heroic struggles in the past twenty months have repeatedly encountered obstacles and attacks from pro-Japanese traitors, national traitors, defeatism, stubborn elements, and feudal remnants and the comprador class, and that these obstacle forces and attack crises still seriously exist and are latently developing, we women should further recognize the characteristics of our own dual oppression and harm, and intensify our unity and carry out a desperate struggle against these obstructive forces and corrupt elements! In particular, we must carry out a desperate struggle against the "anti-communist armistice pro-Japanese" conspiracy that the Japanese × traitors are intensifying to plot!</p>
<p>Ninth, in view of the seriousness of the internal and external crisis of the fascist aggressors, it can be predicted that the × people's combat in the future will inevitably expose their adventurousness and cruelty even more. Crazy bombing and indiscriminate use of poison gas will be used as the main weapons, and the target will mainly be the people in the rear. The people must intensify the movement to assist our country in enriching air defense and donating air defense and poison prevention items.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also regularly and conscientiously promote women's self-education and cadre training work. We should hold more current affairs forums, wartime work training classes, wartime social, political, and cultural study classes, and self-education organizations on mobilizing women to fight for anti-fascist War of Resistance and nation-building for cadres of women's work and women from all walks of life.</p>
<p>(5) The Issue of the Method of Commemorating "March 8th"</p>
<p>A few days before commemorating last year's March 8th Festival, Chinese women leaders Shi Liang, Shen Zijiou, Lu Huinian, etc. specially held a symposium. The commemorative methods decided at that time can still be used as our reference. They are now appended here:</p>
<p>1. Convene a large gathering of women, inviting women from all walks of life—housewives, working women, female students, factory girls, rural women, etc.—to participate and hold them widely in various places.</p>
<p>2. Carry out the work of comforting wounded soldiers and comforting refugees</p>
<p>3. Launch a one-cent fundraising movement, soliciting one cent from every two women. On the one hand, it can be collected to carry out comfort work. At the same time, it can show the strength of women.</p>
<p>4. Each women's organization launches a membership recruitment movement, so that each women's organization can increase its membership by more than double after the "March 8th" Festival.</p>
<p>5. All newspapers, publications, and bookstores launch a preferential campaign for female readers, especially holding bargain sales and exhibitions of women's publications.</p>
<p>6. Hold a "March 8th" recreational gala to collect funds for comfort and condolence work.</p>
<p>7. Ask newspapers and magazines to publish "March 8th" Festival special issues.</p>
<p>8. Broadcast the "March 8th" commemorative song.</p>
<p>9. At noon on the "January 28th" Festival, observe a moment of silence for five minutes to express the condolences of women across the country to the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots.</p>
<p>10. Each women's organization presents flags and swords to the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek and the front-line anti-Japanese generals to show that women across the country unanimously support the Supreme Leader in leading the country to unite against Japan and strive for final victory.</p>
<p>We should also mention here that, first, we should follow the national policy of united and sustained War of Resistance, and enthusiastically participate in the one-yuan debt repayment movement, on the one hand to show women's loyalty and support for the government, and on the other hand to show the international community Chinese women's loyal participation in anti-fascist and anti-aggression; second, in terms of the National Senate, our women's circles should make further efforts to strive for women's status in the Senate and improve the status of women in politics and society in the future.

Furthermore, over a thousand enemy soldiers attacked Sanyangmiao at the foot of Dabie Mountain, attempting to contain our forces to coordinate with the enemy in Tianmen and seize the opportunity to invade. After three days of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. To avoid being surrounded by the enemy due to our inferior numbers, we retreated to Luohanling near Sanyangdian last night to await an opportunity for a counter-attack.

<h3 id="e4">Successful Test Flight on the Chongqing-Burma Route; Official Opening Postponed; Representatives from Imperial Airways Fly to Chongqing for Consultation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The small aircraft "Pickle Crowther 37," used for test flights between China and Britain, flew from Rangoon to Kunming. Due to the lateness of the day, it was unable to continue the flight that day. It then flew from Kunming to Chongqing on the 27th. The Pickle Crowther aircraft took off at 2:00 PM and arrived here at 5:30 PM in the evening. The test flight between China and Britain was a smooth success. As for the official opening, originally scheduled to begin on the 28th, it has reportedly been postponed due to inadequate preparation.</p>
<p>[Local News] Our government authorities, in order to develop civil aviation and open up international air routes to facilitate cultural exchange and transportation with foreign countries, are cooperating with the British to open the Yunnan-Burma air route. At the same time, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is also establishing the Chongqing-Burma route, assigning large aircraft to make regular flights to connect with the Yunnan-Burma route, to develop Sino-British aviation. Regarding the opening of these two routes, CNAC and Imperial Airways are actively preparing, aiming to begin operations as quickly as possible. CNAC has already sent an aircraft for a successful test flight on the Chongqing-Burma air route. The Yunnan-Burma air route is also ready, with the test flight scheduled for March 2nd. Mr. Merry, the General Manager for the Far East of Imperial Airways, flew from Hong Kong to Yunnan some time ago to plan the terminal station for the Yunnan-Burma route. Yesterday morning, Mr. Merry took a CNAC flight from Hong Kong to Chongqing. The purpose of this trip is to discuss the itinerary and passenger and postal rates for the Yunnan-Burma air route with our government authorities. After a one-day stay in Chongqing and the completion of his mission, he will transfer to Kunming to inspect the airport arrangements. After the Yunnan-Burma route test flight is completed, he will leave Yunnan for Hong Kong on the 8th of next month. The date for the Yunnan-Burma test flight is set for March 2nd. At that time, Imperial Airways will send an aircraft from Rangoon to Yunnan for the first test flight, and will return from Yunnan to Rangoon on the 4th. If the test flight is successful and satisfactory, regular passenger service will begin as scheduled. After this route opens, Imperial Airways plans to temporarily use a large aircraft capable of carrying eighteen passengers from the Singapore-India air route. Once new aircraft arrive, they will be assigned to this route, while the original aircraft will return to its original service. As for the passenger and postal fares for the new Yunnan-Burma route, they will be officially announced after the test flight is successful and Mr. Merry returns to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chongqing-Burma air route, which is closely related to the Yunnan-Burma route, has already successfully completed its test flight before the Yunnan-Burma route. CNAC, which is managing the route, sent an aircraft from Chongqing to Kunming at 6:10 AM on the 22nd of this month, transferring to Burma for the first test flight, also carrying a portion of mail. At 9:30 AM that morning, it arrived in Kunming, stayed for one hour, and continued its flight. It also landed in "Li Su" along the way for a brief stop, then continued to Burma, arriving at its destination at 5:00 PM that afternoon. After a two-day stay in Burma, it left Burma on the 5th to return to Chongqing. The test flight was very successful. Official flights may begin during the day, possibly before the Yunnan-Burma route opens.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Hankou News: According to American nationals from Kuling, the reason why the American nationals in Kuling did not evacuate was because they were devoted to their duties and eager to serve the Chinese people. Dr. and Mrs. Ban Bubo were unwilling to abandon their duties. Ms. Nostrand had adopted several Chinese girls when she evacuated from Nanjing, so she risked her life and did not want to leave them. Ms. Folley Ai is the only foreign nurse in Kuling and decided to stay on the mountain to rescue Chinese civilians injured in air raids. The rest left the mountain because they were old and weak and could not endure the hardship of the journey.</p>

<h3 id="e13">President Kong Reports at the National Political Council; Central and Local Party and Government Affairs Continued from Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Part Two of the March Political Report</p>
<p>Next, speaking of internal affairs, the establishment of the National Political Council can both increase the strength of the war of resistance and promote the construction of the new country. We hope that the provincial assemblies can also shoulder these two responsibilities. In the past three months, the Executive Yuan has made every effort to urge the provinces to establish provisional assemblies. We feel that this matter cannot be delayed too much, but it should not be done carelessly either. The government originally set January 1st of this year as the date for the convening of the provisional assemblies in various provinces. Because this is a pioneering undertaking, preparations were difficult, and transportation was difficult, the provinces requested an extension of the deadline. The government considered the local situation and approved the extensions separately. Generally, many provincial provisional assemblies can be convened in March and April. Recently, several provincial chairmen came to Chongqing to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. I took the opportunity to have thorough discussions with them about the provincial assemblies and other local administrative issues. Everyone felt that the candidates for the assembly should be able to represent public opinion and have the ability to handle affairs. In order to achieve the purpose of gathering ideas and benefiting from all sources, not only are current civil servants not allowed to be elected, but all those who have already participated in practical politics should make way as much as possible, so that leaders from all walks of life can have more opportunities to participate. The spirit of sincere unity has already been demonstrated in the Political Council, and it will certainly be demonstrated in the provincial assemblies in the future.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>The past three months have been a period of major reorganization of the central and local party, government, and military affairs. The purpose of the reorganization is to adapt to the second phase of the War of Resistance. In addition to the Executive Yuan formulating the second phase wartime administrative plan, at the central level, this Fifth Plenary Session passed the establishment of the National Defense Supreme Council during the War of Resistance to unify the command of the party, government, and military affairs, exercising the functions of the Central Political Conference. The departments and committees affiliated with the Central Party Headquarters and the departments and committees affiliated with the five Yuan of the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission are also subject to the command of the National Defense Supreme Council. The Chairman is concurrently the Director-General of the Kuomintang. In order to make the organization more agile and increase its effectiveness, the National Defense Supreme Council does not need to handle all party, government, and military affairs according to peacetime procedures and can issue orders and act expediently. In the future, the coordination of politics and military affairs will become even closer. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Zhejiang in the Midst of Restoration and Reorganization <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>— An Interview with Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong —</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guilin Airmail Dispatch] History tells us that Zhejiang has always been a base for avenging grievances and restoring the nation.</p>
<p>Anyone with a slight understanding of ancient Chinese history can recount the story of the rise and fall of Wu and Yue in what are now Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. This story, under the great pen of historians, constitutes the greatest and most perfect textbook of the nation and the country, and for thousands of years has served as a lesson for oppressed nations and countries in the universe.</p>
<p>Since the enemy swept through the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou triangle in the eastern theater of war, our army has been holding the south bank of the Qiantang River for more than a year. During this period, the enemy, initially due to strategic reasons and ultimately due to insufficient strength, has caused the war in this area to enter a state of semi-dormancy. Our side, however, took the opportunity to reorganize its military, restore its strength, and retrain its forces, just like Goujian of Yue when he returned from being humbled at the side of Gusu Terrace. At that time, the territory of Yue stretched from Haiyan in the north to Gumo (Weixian) in the west, the entire Yong area (Ninghai) in the east, and Xieli (Jiaxing) in the west, and this territory of eight hundred square miles is also equivalent to the depth of the depth of the area held and guerilla areas for Zhejiang of the Xth warzone today. Moreover, the enemy's situation and our countermeasures are even more consistent with what Wen Zhong said to Goujian: "In planning the country and defeating the enemy, observe the signs. Now, Wu takes advantage of the might of the gods to command the world, but does not know that its virtue is thin and its benevolence is shallow; its path is narrow and its resentment is widespread; its power is suspended and its wisdom is declining; its strength is exhausted and its prestige is broken; its army is defeated and its soldiers retreat; and its soldiers are scattered and its people are disintegrated. I ask the king to train his troops and wait for their downfall, and then attack them. The soldiers will not be bloodied and the soldiers will not turn their heels. The rulers and ministers of Wu will be captured. I ask the king to remain silent and not to show his movements, so as to observe their quietness." It is a coincidence. When I interviewed Mr. Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in Guilin and discussed the administration of Zhejiang Province, I felt that the future of China and Japan is likely to follow the trend of Wu and Yue in medical history.</p>
<p>King Goujian of Yue's determination to sleep on brushwood and taste gall, and his deep scheming were one of the reasons for the destruction of Wu and the restoration of the country; but if he had not had Fan Li, who was "bright and knew the internal affairs," and Wen Zhong, who was "far-sighted and saw the external affairs," to give him great assistance in politics, then it is feared that no one would be able to give a definitive answer to the question of whether King Fuchai of Wu would have "exposed his flesh and crawled on his knees" to him. Therefore, striving for political victory is really a prerequisite for obtaining military victory. Although Zhejiang is far behind the enemy's lines, there is a danger of being surrounded and attacked by the enemy, but there is also the advantage of rising up and launching a successful attack in one fell swoop. In order to realize the final victory as soon as possible, the people of the country have deep concerns and expectations for the administration of Zhejiang Province. Mr. Huang Shaoxiong used to be in charge of internal affairs, but now he is in charge of Zhejiang, and his spirit of hard work and practical work has long been admired by all parties. From his conversation, we can not only understand the current situation in Zhejiang, but also seek the signs of victory.</p>
<p>The politics of Zhejiang Province are developing with the evolution of the situation. At present, provincial administration is advancing towards six goals: (1) Self-defense mobilization, (2) Conscription, (3) Financial mobilization, (4) Improving rural mechanisms, (5) Adjusting products, and (6) Traffic control. Among these, except for items (2), (5), and (6), which have been progressing smoothly, items such as "Self-Defense Mobilization," "Financial Mobilization," and "Improving Chen Village Institutions" are particularly successful.</p>
<p>"Self-defense mobilization" means mobilizing the armed masses, so that the masses automatically arm themselves to defend villages, towns, counties, and districts in a passive way, and directly participate in the war of national liberation in an active way. There are now ××10,000 rifles in Zhejiang. In addition to each village and town having its own self-defense force, each county has × battalion of self-defense teams, and each district has × regiment of self-defense teams, and they can be used in a concentrated way. Although this inevitably increases the burden on the people slightly, it is understood by the majority. This huge mass force is the vanguard of sweeping and destroying in the future great counter-offensive. When the greedy enemy wants to go deeper into the interior of Zhejiang again, it will also become a great help to the regular army, cooperating to block and annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>The slogan of "financial mobilization" is "those who have money contribute money," but it does not necessarily mean asking someone to pay. The rich areas of Zhejiang are in the Jiaxiang Hangzhou area, and they fell one after another after the all-out war of resistance for four months. Although these thirteen counties account for only a weak sixth of the province's seventy-five counties, it cannot be said to be a very large loss in Zhejiang's financial budget. After a period of reorganization to eliminate corruption and increase consumption tax rates, financial revenue has increased by one-fifth compared to the original revenue. Therefore, Zhejiang Province's budget, which has never exceeded 30 million yuan in previous years, has jumped to over 40 million yuan this year. This financial miracle not only illustrates that the so-called clean politics of the past was only a touching slogan, but also provides a model for the financial bureaus of various provinces; at the same time, it tells the people of the country that our country's politics are not "there is no way," but "there is no way" only.</p>
<p>Most noteworthy is the work of "improving rural institutions." All levels of government in Zhejiang Province, from districts to counties, now have "political work guidance offices." They train young people who have graduated from universities or middle schools to engage in propaganda, explanation, and promotion of government decrees to the people. Their position is between the government and the people, serving as a medium between the government and the people. At present, there are no less than 4,000 people working in various districts and counties throughout the province, with an average of two political workers for every 10,000 people in Zhejiang. Their working principle is "concentrated application" and "responsible for districts." They work for three weeks a month and train for one week, which means they are constantly learning, working, experimenting, and improving. It can be said to be one of the best teaching methods and working methods.</p>
<p>As for the occupied areas, because the enemy is not only unable to expand the war zone, but even unable to maintain the originally occupied areas, the local county administration is proceeding as usual. The central government originally had a clear order to exempt the occupied areas from rent and taxes; however, the Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that paying taxes to the government is one of the duties of the people. It is also one of the conditions for the constitution of the country. In order to prevent the people in the occupied areas from forgetting their obligations to the country and to prevent them from obliterating the concept of the country, land in the occupied areas is still subject to rent and taxes. However, the original tax of more than one yuan per mu is now only taxed at one or two jiao. In addition, there are political work teams that work in the occupied areas all the time.</p>
<p>The port of Wenzhou has not yet been blockaded by the enemy. It is now the only hole for coastal trade and transportation, and the daily necessities imported from Shanghai through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are very crowded. In the past, unscrupulous merchants inevitably changed the trademarks of enemy goods in Shanghai and mixed them into the interior for profit, but now there are seven checkpoints between Wenzhou and Jinhua to specifically check these enemy goods. If they are found, they will be confiscated. But it is feared that it will still be difficult to eliminate them completely.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Saving the Nation in Hengyang <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>On the third day of the Hengyang All Circles Resistance Committee's fundraising performance for wounded soldiers. At the invitation of Mr. Liu Qidi, the person in charge of the committee, and my old friend Mr. Gao Teng, the instructor of the Political Department Film Screening Team of the Military Commission, I went to watch the performance. Around 7 p.m., the venue was already full of audience members. Soon the opening was announced, and the program included the following items:</p>
<p>First, the comrades of the Political Department of the 49th Division jointly performed Cantonese music. The tones were sometimes very beautiful and sometimes very heroic. After three songs, the lingering sound lingered in my ears, truly giving one the feeling of "echoing around the beams for three days."</p>
<p>The second act was Mr. Song Zhiyuan from Shanghai's "Steel Wire Performance." No matter which character—male, female, comical, or serious—was singing, he could play it with that single-string steel wire, making it sound extremely similar to listening to a gramophone. Later, because the audience requested an encore, he played several other sounds, including "Rooster Crowing," "Dog Barking," "Dogs Fighting," and "Military Band Marching By," all of which were very lifelike and moving.</p>
<p>The third act was the 8th Team of the Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Commission performing "Our National Flag." In the scene, a girl snatched the Japanese flag that her traitorous father had hung on the door and tore it to pieces, replacing it with our beautiful 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth' flag. The audience couldn't help but stand up in unison, as if attending a flag-raising ceremony, to pay their respects to it!</p>
<p>The fourth act was the comrades of the Political Department of the 49th Division performing "Seeking Life from Death." After a change of scenery, the male and female staff members of the department sang several songs for saving the nation. When they sang of tragic moments, the singers shed tears of emotion, and the listeners also took out their handkerchiefs to wipe their eyes. The whole venue was silently quiet for a while, which was, of course, a reflection of everyone's spiritual exchange and gathering.</p>
<p>The last act was the 8th Team performing "Returning to the Mountain." This described how some people in the Dabie Mountains, after being displaced by the war, came down the mountain hoping to live their dream of a "peaceful life." However, the Japanese invaders occupying the area committed atrocities such as forcibly conscripting men, demanding military rations, and kidnapping young women, disturbing the peace of the people and driving families to ruin. As a result, they revived the idea of "returning to the mountain" and embarked on the path of "becoming guerrillas." The story was based on real materials, and the actors' expressions were masterful, so the audience remained in deep thought and did not leave their seats for a long time after the play ended.</p>
<p>The 8th Team, which performed the most brilliantly tonight, was formerly the 8th Team of the Shanghai Drama Circle's National Salvation Association Drama Troupe. After the start of the August 13th War of Resistance, the Shanghai drama community organized a total of thirteen national salvation drama troupes, which were distributed to the front lines or the rear to work. The 8th Team was assigned to Anhui.</p>
<p>When the team was first established, the number of people was very small, and the funds were entirely donated by the members themselves. The route they traveled for their work covered almost all the important cities north and south of the Yangtze River in Anhui, where they conducted theatrical performances and general propaganda work for national salvation through oral and written means. It is estimated that about 500,000 people were propagandized in Anhui, and nine new scripts were created based on fresh and realistic materials. These were repeatedly performed and received general praise.</p>
<p>When they were working in Tongcheng, just as Xuzhou and Hefei were successively lost, they intensified their efforts with local public and private national salvation personnel to transport rice and salt and organize farmers' associations, in order to lay the foundation for establishing guerrilla work. Unexpectedly, they did not have enough time. When Fengcheng fell, their return route was cut off, and they were forced to enter the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>Then they transferred to Wuhan. Time passed quickly. Looking back to the beginning of the August 13th team, they had worked for a full year. It was in this August that they were reorganized and placed under the system of the Political Department of the Military Commission along with other drama groups with working histories and experiences. The team was then sent to work in Hunan.</p>
<p>According to the quota stipulated by the Political Department, the team currently has a total of 30 male and female members, including primary and secondary school teachers, college and high school students, journalists, civil servants, and businessmen. Although their backgrounds are different, they all share the same goal of saving the nation and work hard. Therefore, they cooperate very well when writing and performing plays, and their performances are powerful and moving. On the objective side, the general audience, who seem to have some expectations at the moment, also need to be instilled with such national salvation awareness and methods. This will certainly contribute to unexpected gains for the authors and performers. Work hard while the opportunity arises, dramatic propagandists, work hard!</p>

<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 27th] Japanese sources say that the Japanese side is not satisfied with the reply to the Public Works Department. The Japanese officials still hold a firm attitude and refuse to compromise. It is said that the second note will be sent to the Public Works Department tomorrow, and the note has been approved by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 27th] The Japanese side has now sent a team of troops, the number of which is unknown, to station in the area adjacent to the Concession in western Shanghai to replace the police of the pseudo-"Greater Shanghai Municipal Government." The Japanese side considers this a warning to the Public Works Department to accept the Japanese demands as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, 27th] Foreign reports say that according to reliable sources, the pseudo-"Reformed Government" stated in a threatening statement to the Concessions that it would take "resolute action." The so-called "resolute action" is said to include cutting off the daily supply of Shanghai from the countryside and the Shanghai Concessions. The Greater Shanghai Municipal Government has discussed this matter on Saturday.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, 27th] Foreign reports say that after the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction with the reply to the Public Works Department and the "Reformed Government" issued a threatening statement to the Concession authorities, the atmosphere here became tense again. Officials of the Public Works Department are unwilling to announce the contents of the Japanese demands and the Public Works Department's reply. However, it is known that the reply was decided after several telegrams between the local authorities and officials in London and Washington. It is believed that the British and American governments have decided to do their best to support the Shanghai Public Works Department to cope with the Japanese demands. All preparations here have not been relaxed since they began last Saturday. Police officers in the two Concessions are also concentrated and on standby to prevent any intimidation or action against the Concessions. The headlines are very alarming, "If Japan Warns the Shanghai Concessions... Japan Threatens Britain," but no commentary is published. "A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail said that no new news had come last night, but the facts on Saturday were quite unexpected, and the current evolution is quite difficult. The situation in Tianjin is also being closely watched, and he expressed...". The correspondent also said that the British government has expressed satisfaction with Japan's apology and measures regarding the bombing of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 27th] The atmosphere here is still very tense. The new ultimatum that the Japanese side originally planned to send to the Public Works Department has been postponed until tomorrow. The content of the ultimatum has not yet been revealed, but it is generally believed that it will not completely close the door to negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 27th] The Asahi Shimbun announced today that the contents of the Shanghai Public Works Department's reply to the Japanese side are ambiguous and show no sign of accepting the specific proposals of the Japanese side. The Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy and the Foreign Minister held a meeting at 11 o'clock this morning and believe that at least in the short term, they should trust the sincerity of the Public Works Department and reserve the right to take "free action." The Japanese representative in Shanghai will go to see Mr. Fankling, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, to submit the second note and express that the Public Works Department's reply has "accepted the Japanese demands in principle." However, the Japanese side will still make every effort to negotiate in order to achieve its original demands.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 27th] According to the Domei News Agency, the Nanjing Reformed Government issued a declaration today, stating that "We will only engage in secret warfare against the British and French transport ships (which can be regarded as an extension of the Concessions) that use the Shanghai Public Concessions and the Yangtze River as a base to provide assistance to the Chiang regime." It also stated that the pseudo-Reformed Government is deploying troops around the Concessions "to prevent the recurrence of terrorist movements." "If Britain and France do not consider changing their attitude of assisting Chiang, we will not hesitate to regard British and French ships and the Public Concessions as enemies." At the same time, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are also very dissatisfied with the cold attitude adopted by the Public Works Department and its response to the Japanese demands.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Franco Government Britain Announces Recognition Yesterday Sends Ambassador for Diplomatic Liaison Defend Against Totalitarian Powers' Influence in Spain <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the British government officially recognizes the Franco government, saying that the Spanish Civil War has lasted for two and a half years, and more than two million people have been killed or injured. The British government's move is not only to adapt to the established facts, but also to promote an early end to the war. The exact time of the announcement is unknown, but it is believed to be around 3:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. At the same time, Chamberlain also read to the House of Commons Franco's written guarantee, stating that he would not take retaliatory actions and would forever maintain national independence. According to sources here, the British government has internally decided to appoint Mr. Nancebon as the ambassador to Spain, but it was announced in the House of Commons that Sir Hodgson will temporarily serve as chargé d'affaires. The new ambassador will present his credentials after Franco agrees and will quickly conduct diplomatic liaison in order to reach formal political and economic agreements with Franco as soon as possible to defend against the influence of totalitarian countries in Spain. Although it is believed here that Franco will fulfill his promise to guarantee national independence, there are currently about 30,000 Italian troops and tens of thousands of German troops who remain in Spain and have not withdrawn.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] It is believed here that the decision of Britain and France to recognize the Franco government is a failure for Britain and France. Today, the newspapers here "expressed that Britain and France once used obvious or secret methods to assist the Spanish government forces, and now this policy has failed."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Britain has decided to recognize the Spanish Franco government and is expected to announce it tomorrow. This matter caused a dispute this afternoon. A crowd held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square to oppose the government's actions. Leaders of the opposition party, Attlee and Morrison, and Ms. Wilkinson spoke successively, and then passed a resolution condemning the government's policy as "shameful and abominable." The crowd went to Downing Street, but Attlee, Morrison, and other leaders hired cars to go, and the crowd followed on foot, shouting slogans. After they arrived at Downing Street, they saw that the road was closed and guarded by mounted police. A small conflict occurred between the police and the demonstrators, but fortunately there were no serious consequences.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Cairo, 27th] The Egyptian cabinet met yesterday and passed a resolution to immediately recognize the Franco government as the sole government of Spain. According to past practice, Egypt's recognition of the Franco government must be after Britain's. It is reported that Egypt will immediately restore commercial relations with various places under the Franco government, because Egypt has a large supply of cotton to Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] According to sources here, Spanish government President Azaña may announce his official resignation this afternoon after Britain and France announced their official recognition of the Franco government. At the same time, it is reported that he will issue a statement stating that the Spanish government should abandon the fight. Since the Franco government has already been recognized here, the Spanish government's ambassador to France, Martinez, has now moved from the embassy to a hotel. The Spanish ambassador requested that the French allow embassy staff to stay in France temporarily. Other Spanish government agencies are also closing down rapidly. It is also known that Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo will return to Madrid from here within a few days to continue the struggle, while Mr. Billard, the French representative to the Franco government, will be appointed as the first ambassador of the Franco government to France.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] The British government instructed Sir Hodgson, the special envoy to Burgos, on Monday morning to inform General Franco that he was recognized as the official government of Spain, and at the same time appointed Sir Hodgson as the chargé d'affaires to Spain to temporarily handle negotiations between the two countries. Hodgson once served as a special envoy in Burgos, responsible for diplomatic missions for 15 months, and served as chargé d'affaires in Moscow from 1924 to 1927.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 27th] Regarding whether Spanish President Azaña has left the Spanish embassy here, there was no confirmation as of yesterday afternoon. It is said that this matter was realized last night. Before leaving France, Azaña will sign a document resigning from the position of President of Spain and issue a statement of his intention so that the public can know. At noon today, an official from the Spanish embassy here met with a representative of "Le Temps" and said that "There is no formal official news about when President Azaña will decide on his actions. It is expected that the decision will not be delayed for too long, and it will be announced by radio or newspaper at that time." The official also said, "President Azaña is a prudent and thoughtful person. Sometimes he may be too far-sighted. The resignation of a head of state is a public action. If President Azaña resigns, he must sign a resignation document and place it in the embassy here to comply with current diplomatic and judicial precedents." Currently, there are 15 armed police officers guarding the Spanish embassy, and there are also many photographers outside the embassy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] Spanish President Azaña took a fast train from here to Turkey at 10:20 tonight and plans to live in his brother-in-law's country villa. It is not known whether Azaña signed a document renouncing the position of President of Spain before leaving here.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Although the Spanish government has not expressed its attitude towards the unconditional surrender demanded by the rebels, there is no doubt that the Spanish war is coming to an end. After Britain and France recognize the Franco government, the Spanish government may express its surrender. If the Spanish government continues to resist, experts believe that it will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 19th] According to an official news agency dispatch from Barcelona, Franco has refused to accept a large loan from Britain. Political circles here are very pleased, believing that although Britain and France recognize Franco, Franco still maintains his loyal friendship with Italy. The Fascist side believes that Franco will carry out a reconstruction plan jointly with the countries that sent troops to help him fight and warns Franco not to accept economic assistance from Britain and France. The Italian newspapers unanimously praise Britain and France's recognition of the Franco government as a great victory for Fascism and say that Madrid will fall at any moment after Britain and France are forced to recognize it.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 27th] The order and economic conditions of the city have been restored. Yesterday, the consulates of Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, and Portugal were reopened and operated as usual.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 27th] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had his second talk with Polish Foreign Minister Burke yesterday afternoon. Both sides kept silent about the content. Also, Ciano attended the unveiling ceremony of the memorial monument for Colonel Nallo yesterday morning. Colonel Nallo was an Italian who participated in the January Uprising in 1863 and was martyred. The memorial monument was donated by the city of Bergamo and transported to Warsaw to be established.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Warsaw, 26th) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Burke this afternoon. It is reported that Ciano had asked Burke to clarify Poland's attitude towards Italy's demands on France. Therefore, Burke's speech last night is particularly noteworthy. Burke's speech is regarded here as a hint that Poland has no intention of tacitly supporting any policy that may hinder the interests of Poland's ally, France. At the same time, Germany is now planning to expand its commercial and political influence in southeastern Europe. What kind of attitude Mussolini, the Italian Foreign Minister, holds is what Colonel Burke is eager for Ciano to clarify. Regarding Hungary's request to occupy the Czech Little Russia so that the Polish-Hungarian border can be adjacent, the Italian and German arbitration previously expressed a veto, causing extreme dissatisfaction from Poland. Polish political circles believe that Little Russia is currently the center of anti-Polish propaganda movements.</p>

France hopes to restore commercial relations with Spain and does not want any borders between the two countries that need to be defended. Bonnet said that French-German relations have improved, and French-British relations are becoming even closer.

<h3 id="e34">The Number One Enemy of Democracy, The Mouthpiece of Fascism — Italian Journalist Gayda — <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— (Translated by Dong Ping from the English-language "Hong Kong Telegraph")</p>
<p>Those who have studied psychology probably know the term "self-abasement complex." Strictly speaking, the so-called "self-abasement complex" is a pathological condition of losing self-esteem and distrusting oneself. Its formation has various reasons, but the consequences are the same, never seeking improvement.</p>
<p>"Self-abasement complex" is not limited to individuals; many countries often suffer from it. Intimidation, slaughter, and strife are its most prominent symptoms.</p>
<p>If a country unknowingly suffers from this disease, it is very dangerous. Naturally, if someone can foresee it and correct it, it is always an unparalleled achievement for that country.</p>
<p>In today's Europe, there is one country suffering from a "self-abasement complex," and that is Italy. Similarly, in this country, there is also a farsighted person striving to eradicate his country's illness. He is the renowned Italian journalist Gayda, currently a prolific writer for "Giornale d'Italia."</p>
<p>If it's not too much of an exaggeration, Gayda's articles can perhaps be considered the most popular in the world. What he publishes in the newspaper every day has become a coveted source of information for foreign correspondents in Rome. Abroad, many democratic newspapers publish daily telegrams from Rome correspondents, which naturally include Gayda's grand pronouncements. Even regular newspaper readers can easily find Gayda's articles on that page.</p>
<p>It is indeed a fact that Gayda is often the first to publish government news; but in reality, he cannot be considered exceptionally well-informed. In Italy, there are many journalists who are more capable and have better connections than him. His prominence is entirely due to his alertness and willingness to speak.</p>
<p>When he decides that something is beneficial to Italy, he will immediately try every means to make it known to the world. But regarding things that are unfavorable, he also holds onto them tightly.</p>
<p>During the Italo-Ethiopian War, Gayda was specially permitted to read the Maffey Report, the main point of which was to state that British merchants in Abyssinia were not against Italy. With a quick move, Gayda published this report in his own newspaper, thinking it would strike a blow to British public opinion. Who knew that this backfired, and it became the best propaganda for Britain, proving that Britain's advocacy of sanctions was not selfish.</p>
<p>People usually say that Gayda is Mussolini's spokesperson, but this is not entirely correct. He does not, as some people say, have intimate talks with the Prime Minister every day, and his views are not entirely the same as fascist policies.</p>
<p>Mussolini has his own "Il Popolo d'Italia." This newspaper is entirely Mussolini's own, and he is fully responsible for its operation. Gayda has no part in it. It is said that every night, an editor comes to wake Mussolini from his bed and discuss and decide on the next day's newspaper. And it is in this newspaper that Mussolini often makes grand pronouncements.</p>
<p>Gayda's sources of information, like those of many of his colleagues, are from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He always has to make a trip there every day, where he is sincerely received by Ciano or other important officials.</p>
<p>In Italy, Gayda, as a big-name editor-in-chief, naturally has his own special status. Even so, all his words and actions still cannot represent the official opinion. Therefore, we say that Gayda is neither Mussolini's spokesperson nor the true voice of the Italian people; he is really just a mouthpiece for the fascist lackeys.</p>
<p>Gayda does not represent the Italian people at all. He always stands in the crowd of fascist lackeys, leading the other lackeys to shout together. Although he knows full well that Italy's power is limited, he still strives to promote Italy as one of the great powers. Although he knows full well that Italy's colonial ambitions have already taken too much of a beating, he still desperately advocates for Italy's external expansion.</p>
<p>Recently, Gayda once again exaggerated the so-called Italian "natural tendency," stirring up a fiery anti-French movement. He vigorously advocated in the newspaper that Italians are not only no worse than the French, but even surpass them, so Italy should seize all colonies back from France.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Gayda does not represent the majority of the Italian people, so his reputation in the country is not very high. On the contrary, he is quite famous abroad, which is probably thanks to the promotion of foreign correspondents in Rome.</p>
<p>Gayda is 65 years old. He is from the province of Piedmont in northern Italy. In his early years, he served as a foreign affairs correspondent for the "Post" in Tunis. He traveled in Germany and Russia for many years, is proficient in several languages, and has written many works. Twelve years ago, he left the "Post" and went to Rome to take up the position of editor of "Giornale d'Italia." At this time, he was spotted by the fascist officials and promoted to be a standard mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Before he joined the fascists, he was originally a loyal nationalist. Now, although he holds a position under the fascists, he still forms his own faction and firmly believes in nationalism. In addition, the most noteworthy thing in his thinking is his intense anti-peace and anti-democratic evil ideas. All his words and actions always start from this evil idea and are developed from it.</p>
<p>Gayda is an outstanding journalist in Italy, but in the world, he is the number one enemy of democracy.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e35">Britain and France Recognize the Rebel Government in Spain <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Bonnet announced on the 26th of this month the recognition of the Franco regime, the rebel army in Spain. The British government also formally announced the recognition of the Franco government on the 27th of this month. This matter has aroused two different reactions: One is a shallow pessimistic view, believing that this move by the British and French governments fully demonstrates the failure of the peace front, and the international situation will tend towards a new dark age; the other is a blindly optimistic view, believing that the concessions made by Britain and France to Italy and Germany can be a sign of concentrating forces to deal with the crisis in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, both of these views only see one side of the situation and do not see the whole picture, and the result cannot but be wrong. We know that the Spanish rebel army and its regime led by Franco are, on the one hand, puppets who violate the common will of the entire Spanish people and accept the orders of German aggressors, and on the other hand, vanguard forces who violate the common will of justice- and peace-loving people around the world, and promote the crisis of world war. Therefore, the recognition by Britain and France not only cannot temporarily stabilize Europe, but will inevitably further strengthen the appetite of fascist aggressors and intensify the conquest of Europe and Africa. Britain and France will have no possibility of concentrating on the East. Moreover, the Japanese aggressors are today taking risks and provoking in the Far East, which is precisely the result of Britain and France implementing a policy of compromise in Europe, and is precisely the prelude to responding to Italy and Germany's new conquests in the West. It can be seen that the blindly optimistic view that Britain and France's concessions in the West can concentrate on dealing with the Far East incident is completely unfounded. However, we should also understand at the same time that the direct negative impact of the recognition of the rebel regime in Spain by the British and French rulers is not on the peace front, but on the British and French rulers themselves. Please see the London dispatch of the 26th of Reuters, which stated that on the 26th, Londoners gathered to oppose the recognition of the rebel regime in Spain, and clashed with the police, which can prove this. Therefore, the recognition of the rebel regime in Spain by the British and French rulers will actually expose the true face of all hypocritical, cowardly, and compromising policies, and the popular opposition movement of the British and French people will be more widely developed under the leadership of revolutionary parties and progressive people. This is inevitable. This situation will further raise the tide of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression united front, make the oppressed masses and peace-loving people all over the world more united, and will prove that the shallow pessimistic view is unfounded.</p>
<p>The result of the recognition of the rebel regime in Spain by the British and French rulers is neither the stabilization of the Western situation, nor will the aggressors in the Far East be severely sanctioned. The only result will be the greater frenzy of the Eastern and Western aggressors, the greater severity of the world war crisis, and at the same time, it will also be the development of the peace front from greater difficulties under the impetus of the broad masses!</p>
<h3 id="e36">Happy Valley and Bonham Road <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>These days, Happy Valley is crowded with people!</p>
<p>These days, Bonham Road is bustling with traffic!</p>
<p>Happy Valley is holding its spring horse races. In ancient times, spring outings for horse trials were a sign of youthful spirit, but today's horse races are a manifestation of seeking excitement and hoping for luck. We have witnessed the grand scene of "carriages like an ant colony, people like a tide" in Happy Valley. I wonder if we can still think of the scenes of gunfire and wailing that fill our homeland?</p>
<p>The English-language school on Bonham Road, the Imperial College, and the Yingzhen Branch’s Fundraising Committee are holding a “Charity Bazaar and Carnival.” It is actually also “a variety of things in the venue, entertainment and disaster relief can be achieved at the same time, and the traffic outside the venue is busy, and enthusiastic people are in high spirits." Those who participated in this grand event should be many times more noble than the men and women in Happy Valley! Happy Valley will use the elation of a few people to cause the dejection of hundreds of thousands of people; the Yingzhen bazaar will use the generous donations of a few people to create the cheers of hundreds of thousands of refugees!</p>
<p>However, according to recent statistics, the total amount of donations from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong for national disasters in the past year was only 1.04 million, while the sales of horse lottery tickets in the recent one or two months reached 564,000! Therefore, we still have to ask every overseas Chinese to examine their conscience and ask themselves: Have they fulfilled their duties and are they at peace and happy?</p>

<h3 id="e37">In Response to the Perilous Situation in the Far East, Britain Greatly Increases Military Expenditure in Hong Kong, a Sudden Increase of Two and a Half Times to 17,500 Pounds; Britain Has Accepted Japan’s Compensation Terms for the Luohu Bombing Incident <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The British government authorities, in order to cope with the perilous situation in the Far East, will increase the defensive strength of Hong Kong and Singapore. In recent years, military training has been carried out and military preparations have been actively promoted. The figures for defense military expenditures have also been increasing year by year. It is found that the British 1939 military expenditure budget has now been drafted and published. The case contains detailed discussions on the general situation of foreign troops, as well as descriptions of the Hong Kong military construction costs, and stipulates that 7,000 British pounds will be used for the general preparation of the Hong Kong Royal Signals Team. 1,000 pounds of this was sold last year. The cost of various military deployments in Hong Kong has increased substantially, totaling 17,500 pounds, compared to 5,000 pounds last year, an increase of 250 percent. The Singapore Volunteer Army expenditure last year also increased to 20,000 pounds, more than double the 8,500 pounds in 1937, which is enough to see the importance attached by the British government authorities to the defenses of Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, regarding the incident of aircraft bombing and occupying Luohu, a serious protest has been made to Japan through the British Foreign Office. The Japanese authorities, knowing that they are in the wrong, have replied to the British government, promising to bear all responsibility for compensation for losses and to punish the crazy and aggressive pilot. According to Western news in Hong Kong yesterday, the British government, after some research, has instructed the country’s ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to formally accept the Japanese compensation terms from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and representatives of the two governments have been designated to investigate the truth of the destruction in Hong Kong and to hold negotiations in Hong Kong. The British government representative is the Hong Kong Colonial Secretary Smith, and the Japanese representative is the Acting Consul-General in Hong Kong, Huang You. This negotiation meeting is said to be held during the day. At present, the representatives of both sides will immediately go to the lake disaster area for inspection, and conduct a survey and statistics of the loss of people and property, in order to carry out negotiations. Regarding the holding of this negotiation meeting and the British acceptance of the Japanese conditions, Colonial Secretary Smith did not express any opinions on the visit of Western newspaper reporters.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Hong Kong Government Prepares to Implement Unified Relief for Refugees in the New Territories; The Refugee Camp Office of the Disaster Relief Federation Suddenly Ordered to Move to Fanling; 6,000 Refugees in Man Kam To Also Housed by the Authorities in Sheds; Refugees Appeal to the Disaster Relief Federation to Continue Fundraising <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>After the various circles disaster relief federation unified the relief of refugees in Shenzhen, they fully intended to reorganize step by step, so that thousands of refugees could have considerable production. However, since the aircraft bombed British territory Luohu on the 21st of this month, the refugee camp of the disaster relief federation rescue team was completely moved to Fanling Cheka temporarily for safety reasons. Yesterday, preparations were made to start distributing rice for relief. Suddenly, a notice was received from the authorities, limiting the immediate transfer of the Fanling East Ka office,</p>
<p>Move to Fanling</p>
<p>The government is fully responsible for it. At the same time, 6,000 refugees in Man Kam To are also housed by the government in the sheds built in the New House Ridge. The person in charge of the refugee camp there received the notice and immediately visited the Medical Superintendent Situ Yongjue, who is in charge of refugee relief, to ask for the reason. According to the person in charge of the refugee camp, Lin Peisheng, who told the reporter the experience, the government is determined to take full responsibility for the unified relief of refugees in British territory, and the affairs office of the disaster relief federation relief team can hand over the affairs in due course. However, the disaster relief federation has been busy taking care of the relief affairs, because now the Hong Kong government will negotiate with the Japanese consul in Hong Kong, intending to delineate the original refugee camp in Shenzhen as a refugee area. In the future, after a specific solution is replied to, it will be handed over to the disaster relief federation relief team for management. In order to comply with the government's decree, the relief team moved the office to Fanling Tea Chuan yesterday as a temporary residence, preparing to hand over the affairs, and waiting for today's Da Xu Zeng to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a express mail was sent to Acting Committee Chairman Xu Shiying of the Central Disaster Relief Committee, the General Affairs Department of the Disaster Relief Federation, the Relief Team of the Disaster Relief Federation, Tung Wah Hospital, and people from all walks of life to appeal to the Disaster Relief Federation to continue to operate. The original text said (omitting the titles) Since the establishment of the Shenzhen Unified Shelter, it has been more than a month, and the improvement of the daily life of our refugees and all the facilities in the shelter are gradually on the right track. For example, medicine is handled by a special department, and women, children, and the elderly are cared for. The results are remarkable.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 21st of this month, aircraft came to attack in groups. In addition to fear and grief, in order to prevent future troubles, our colleagues had to retreat into the Fanling Refugee Camp in the concession as a whole to avoid the disaster. At that time, there was nothing to say about food and accommodation. But because the food is thin porridge and meals, and the sleeping is in a train iron card, it is steamed by the sun during the day, just like a big prisoner, and it is frozen by the iron plate at night, which is extremely cold. In recent days, our refugees have been sick and suffering</p>
<p>About to Die</p>
<p>And the office staff of the camp is not capable, and the suffering is difficult to express. They were forced to report the truth and elect representatives Li Zhi and others to plead for our thousands of refugees, and implore all walks of life to appeal on their behalf and continue the past operations. Our refugees are very grateful. The tearful letter is unbearable to look forward to. Li Zhi, Lai Zhiqin, Li Sen, Chen Quan and other refugee representatives from Fanling led all the refugees to cry, February 27, and so on.</p>

<p>The British Zhenhua Fundraising Committee Bazaar Carnival officially opened at Imperial College on the 26th. The venue was fully equipped, like a small market. Yesterday, tourists, dressed in bright clothes and hairstyles, crowded in. In the evening, celebrity opera actors performed wonderful carnival programs. Although yesterday was the second day of the Grand Prix, the patriotic overseas Chinese did not reduce their support because of this. The carnival started at three o'clock, and tourists came and went like a carload of people. The vendors in the venue shouted the moving slogan "Buy one more item and save a few more lives." The tourists were all moved and generously donated, and they could not forget to save the country in the entertainment. The most meaningful thing was the salted fish department. The place was full of pictures of fishermen being burned by the sea, and there was also a ballad that told the fishermen's plight, which left a deep impression. After drinking in the evening, the number of tourists suddenly increased, and the singing department opened, and those who were addicted to Zhou Lang came in droves. The number of people who came to the scene, before and after, was no less than 45,000. According to the director of the council, the success of this event exceeded expectations, and the funds raised are expected to reach 20,000 yuan. It is found that today is the last day of the conference, and I hope that philanthropists will continue to come to the scene, because one more yuan of assistance will save one more life.

<p>In order to enhance the appearance of the city and facilitate the supply of vegetables to the residents of the Central District, the Hong Kong authorities dismantled the Central Market last year and implemented the construction of a new type of market. The project has been going on for many months since it started, and the entire project has now been completed. The only thing left is the plastering of the outer wall. According to the contractors yesterday, the new market project was originally scheduled to be fully completed in mid-February of the lunar calendar. All projects were carried out smoothly and can be completed within the scheduled time. The important parts have been completed now, and the inner and outer wall surfaces can also be plastered in three weeks. According to the current project observation, the new market is expected to be opened and put into use at the end of next month. The construction of the new market is four stories high and is extremely magnificent and complete. The basement floor is for fresh fish, chicken, and duck stalls, the second floor is for cattle, pigs, sheep, and other stalls, the third floor is for raw vegetables, and the fourth floor is prepared for the Municipal Health Bureau's office. Each floor has more than 300 stalls. The opening of all stalls will be carried out in the next few days, and the old market stallholders from the past will be given priority to bid. The stallholders who moved to the vegetable and fresh fish stalls in Sheung Wan and Sai Wan will be completely moved back at that time, and the original stall addresses will be cancelled.</p>

<p>A tragic event occurred yesterday at 2:10 PM at the Danan Teahouse, number 113 Avenue West. A middle-aged teahouse patron jumped from the fourth floor onto the He Feng Street intersection next door. He instantly fell to the ground, his head exploding and his brain matter splattering. He suffered severe internal injuries and died on the spot. Investigations revealed that at around 1:30 PM yesterday, a middle-aged man, wearing a brownish velvet jacket and trousers, black rubber shoes, and a military-style haircut, looking weary and worn, entered the teahouse and selected a seat near He Feng Street, the one under the middle window. When he ascended the stairs, his face was full of sorrow, as if something terrible had happened. After sitting down, he muttered to himself, sighing continuously. At approximately 2:10 PM, the deceased suddenly stood up and, taking advantage of the other patrons' inattention, climbed onto the windowsill and jumped. Some patrons who happened to be looking at the window saw him jump into the street and cried out in shock. The tea server heard the cry and looked out the window, seeing the deceased with his head shattered, limbs broken, and covered in blood, lying in a pool of blood. He went downstairs to investigate and found that the deceased had died on the spot due to his injuries. He immediately blew the whistle to alert the police and telephoned the 7th Police Station to report the case. The officer on duty at the station immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate. The body was taken to the morgue for autopsy. According to general speculation, the deceased was an unemployed man in his thirties who was addicted to opium. The reason for his suicide may have been due to economic hardship. His name is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Regarding the resumption of shipping negotiations between Guangdong and Hong Kong, which have been underway for some time in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, a resolution has been reached. The Jinshan vessel of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Steamboat Company will set sail for Guangzhou again this morning at 8:00 AM and return to Hong Kong from Guangdong on the 3rd of next month. According to Mr. Lu Si, the secretary of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Steamboat Company, the Jinshan vessel will only carry passengers on this trip to Guangdong and will not transport cargo. Chinese passengers must obtain permission from the Japanese Consulate before purchasing tickets at the shipping company. Passengers of other nationalities do not require this procedure. It is currently unknown whether the service will continue in the future as discussions are still ongoing. It is said that after the Jinshan's trial voyage, both parties hope to continue negotiations and quickly resume the service between Guangdong and Hong Kong using the Taishan and Jinshan vessels.</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Jockey Club's annual horse race has electrified the entire Hong Kong. Yesterday was already a day of great attention as the date for the Derby was held. The Governor of Hong Kong, Luo Fuguo, and his wife and son also attended the event, making it the most bustling day of this year's horse racing season!</p>
<p>The weather was mild, and the sun was smiling. Before 12:00 noon, the trams and buses heading to Happy Valley and Causeway Bay were packed. Many people were waiting at the bus station, and even after waiting for almost 20 minutes, they still could not get on the bus. Happy Valley was crowded with horse carriages and pedestrians shoulder to shoulder, connecting along the road. The cement grandstands were packed with people, and the inner and outer circles of the racetrack were also tightly packed. The lively scene was indescribable!</p>
<p>—— As the bell rang, the jockeys, dressed in colorful attire, entered the arena, holding the reins. Upon command, the horses broke into a gallop, running with all their might. The audience watched with anticipation, shouting and cheering. In the grandstands, fashionable ladies and wealthy merchants gesticulated wildly, their mouths frothing as they engaged in intense excitement!</p>
<p>Time passed by, minute by minute. Some people took out stacks of banknotes, while others handed over sacks of money. As it approached 4:00 PM, the hearts of tens of thousands of spectators inside and outside the venue were pounding. As the numbered balls dropped one by one, the faces of those watching turned pale, and their foreheads were lightly covered in cold sweat! Once the numbers were drawn, except for a few winners, everyone was stunned and sighed deeply in disappointment.</p>
<p>The Derby horses were released, causing another great commotion among the spectators outside the venue. Many people squeezed around, wriggling like maggots, trying to see if their ticket number was on the horses. Ah! 4043... Almost won, so unlucky, just one number away from becoming a millionaire, said a middle-aged woman in the crowd, clenching her fist. Then, everyone started talking, one after another, mostly about the circumstances before and after buying the lottery tickets. Naturally, they were all very clever and, although disappointed, they explained to themselves that wealth and poverty are predestined and cannot be forced!</p>
<p>The huge prize, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, included the hard-earned savings of many. Some people even borrowed money to buy several lottery tickets. As for the wealthy merchants, it goes without saying that they opened their wallets and bought lottery tickets more generously than they would do anything else. It is said that one wealthy individual, when donating to the National Salvation Bonds, gave 500 yuan without hesitation, but spent 50,000 yuan on lottery tickets, ultimately not even winning the consolation prize. He just smiled and let it go, which could not help but be astonishing. Their sacrifice and bravery for their own selfish interests cannot but be admired!</p>
<p>The one-dollar lottery and the "one-dollar to repay debts" campaign were held during the same period. However, the results of the "one-dollar to repay debts" campaign only reached one-tenth of the one-dollar lottery. This cannot but make people sigh. If everyone could show the same enthusiasm for the one-dollar lottery and the same spirit of gambling in horse racing to purchase National Defense Bonds, it is believed that all the bonds in Hong Kong would be completely sold out in less than a month.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that as Chinese citizens, we cannot escape the battle line of resisting aggression and saving the nation. We should take out our assets to purchase bonds to help the country fight the war, instead of throwing this money into these empty and illusory gambling activities.</p>

<p>[Shenzhen Quick News] The Hua Nan bandits, recently becoming aware of our Guangdong province's East, West and North River armies massing, and with a unified force nearly complete and set to launch a large-scale counter-offensive, have become exceptionally alarmed. Consequently, they are employing their usual tactics: launching an invasion of Qiongya Island, and expanding harassment operations on various fronts, in order to constrain our counter-offensive military efforts. Investigations reveal that the enemy forces have been continuously reinforcing the East River at the end of the month, attempting to retake Hui (Zhou) and Bo (Luo) and to occupy Dong (Guan) and Bao (An). As a result, the situation on the East River is tightening, and our military is stepping up deployments, with a major battle likely to break out at any time. The information obtained from various sources here is recorded below.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Hastily Plan to Invade Upstream Along the River</p>
<p>According to reports, the enemy's strongholds in Hecheng, Shitan, Shilong, Guancheng, and Taiping have been reinforced, reaching a total of more than 10,000 troops. The main force is concentrated in Zengcheng, Zhaolong, and Xintang. The enemy forces consist of the Todaren team, each with over two thousand soldiers. Currently, two enemy shallow-water vessels and thirty to forty motorboats are docked on the Shilong River. The enemy has also forcibly requisitioned several civilian boats along the downstream river. It is suspected that the enemy intends to invade Huibo by moving from Zengcheng along the Bo-Zeng highway. However, our army has strong defenses in the Lianfu Mountains, Changning, and Taihe areas, making it difficult for them to succeed. Therefore, the enemy is now planning to advance upstream along the East River. On the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, enemy raiding parties advanced towards our Shangxia Nanheliao and other locations, trying to test the strength of our defenses. As a result, there have been minor skirmishes with the enemy in those areas in recent days.</p>
<p>Wu Qiwai Arrives to Oversee the East River Defenses</p>
<p>Currently, Wu Qiwai, the commander of the East Route Army, arrived in the East River yesterday (the 26th) to oversee the defenses. He has urgently deployed a certain unit to the East River coast, deploying and guarding areas near Qishi and Gangmasi. If the enemy invades, they will be met with a fierce counterattack. Therefore, if the enemy launches a large-scale invasion of Huibo, the major battle will unfold upstream on the East River, between Qishi and Masi.</p>
<p>Recent Activities of the Enemy Forces in Guantai</p>
<p>The enemy forces in Guancheng are still the Fangchuan team, numbering over a thousand, including about three hundred cavalry and eight cannons. Since yesterday when the enemy forces raided Nanshe, Zhangmutou, Dalang, Dasha, and other places, they have not dared to act rashly since the 25th. However, since the enemy has been repeatedly attacked by our guerrillas, they no longer reside within the city. Instead, they are stationed outside the north gate in Xinglongbang, outside the west gate at the Guanzhang Station, outside the east gate in Bubugao, and outside the south gate in the Gangbei Reformatory to prevent our encirclement and attacks. As for the more than one thousand enemy forces in Taiping and Humen, the commander is Yoshida. The enemy forces are stationed in the East Military Field and the Humen Hospital and Normal School. The enemy's "sweeping teams" have not ventured out in the days since they invaded Huangsonggang and Nantou last week. Currently, there are no enemy traces in Baoan County. Huangsonggang, Xixiang, Gushu, Xinqiao, and other areas are slightly desolate due to repeated enemy devastation, and many residents have been relocated. Furthermore, according to intelligence, four enemy vessels arrived at the mouth of the Pearl River on the 22nd, carrying enemy soldiers and military supplies, both light and heavy, which were landed at Humen. They were then transported along the Guanghu Highway and Guantai Highway to Xintang in Dongguan. On the 24th, two enemy vessels were spotted off the coast of Chiwan in Baoan County, patrolling back and forth before sailing away without incident.</p>

<p>[Beihai Quick News] After the enemy occupied Qiongya, the situation in the south became suddenly tense. Several days ago, more than ten enemy vessels concentrated on Weizhou Island, and enemy aircraft repeatedly flew to Beihai, Lianzhou, and other places to scout. In order to prevent enemy troops from landing, our army has strengthened defenses in various locations. The Guangxi troops stationed in the south have all been deployed for defense. The situation is tense, as if on the eve of a major battle. However, since the 24th of this month, the Beihai Air Defense Command has claimed that the enemy vessels have sailed out of Weizhou Island, leaving only two enemy vessels. The enemy aircraft carrier has also moved to the Qiongzhou Strait, docking near the Haikou, and from time to time sending out aircraft to defend the areas of Qiong Island. Due to the enemy vessels moving elsewhere, the situation in the south has eased slightly, and the prosperity of Beihai is as it was in the past.</p>

If the interest guarantee or subsidy is obtained by fraudulent means, in addition to revoking the award and recovering the original amount received, the fraud shall be treated as a crime. If there is a situation where a non-factory product is impersonated, or shadow products are used, and there is substantial evidence, the award shall be canceled. If there is a violation of the regulations of the "Provisional Regulations on the Awarding and Aiding of Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Extraordinary Times" or other relevant laws and regulations, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may revoke the award.</p>
<h3 id="e50">San Shui Gang Gen Enemy Builds Works, West District Teams Seriously Practice Joint Defense <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Zhaoqing Quick News] In the Sanshui area, the enemy is making use of the advantageous terrain on both sides of the He Kou and Southwest areas on the sides of the West District, using a mutually supporting formation. In the coastal villages of the West District, such as Zhennan New Market, Ganggen, Xiaowan, Dangdu, Laosha, and other places, troops are stationed to form a mutually supportive relationship with the Southwest and He Kou areas. To prevent our army from detouring through Gaoming to attack its rear in the West District, troops have been repeatedly sent deep into the villages, attempting to defeat our teams one by one. The surrounding areas, Baiji Market, Ma'an Gang, the seaside, and Xiaheng villages have been invaded, looted, and devastated. Currently, due to the gathering of our large army in Gaoming and Gaoyao, the enemy is extremely alarmed. As the central part of the West District has no defenses, it completely retreated on the 23rd of this month, and retreated to the coast. Recently, in addition to redeploying a portion of the troops away from Sanshui, the remaining troops, about 500, are stationed in Laosha, Ganggen, and Zhennan Market, and multiple electric boats are sent from the Southwest area, carrying cement, iron wire nets, wood, and other materials to the above three locations to construct defensive works, small fortresses, and trench lines. The West District Self-Defense Force has learned from the previous lessons of enemy devastation in various villages. Initiated by Jinguan Village (i.e., the united villages of Jinli Upper and Lower Guanzhuang), the entire district has implemented serious joint armed defense. On the one hand, it has contacted the units of the ××× Army of the new defense forces in Gaoming to curb the enemy's momentum and launch fierce attacks at any time.</p>

<p>[Zhaoqing Quick News] The enemy forces stationed in Guangdong Province have been plotting to invade the West River area. In addition to constantly sending enemy aircraft to indiscriminately bomb various counties in the West River area and sending enemy troops to harass our Jinli and Qingqi positions or launching artillery attacks to probe our defenses, they have also instigated Chinese traitors to infiltrate the West River, Zhaoqing, and Duchen areas, tempting bandits and hinting at enemy aircraft targets. Our military and economic bureaus have repeatedly cracked down on several major traitor organizations in Duchen and Lubu, capturing dozens of traitors, which has deterred traitors from coming. Currently, in order to strictly prevent enemy espionage and traitors from infiltrating, in addition to ordering the defense army and teams to strictly guard against them, the county chiefs have also been ordered to instruct all district, township, village, and Jia chiefs to thoroughly inquire about the origins and investigate the period of residence of those who are not from the village but reside in the village. If they have resided for a long time, they must be guaranteed by the township authorities before being allowed to reside. All villagers must have a citizen certificate to allow them to pass information about our defense troops' stationed terrain.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chen Jitang Spends Tens of Millions of Dollars To Build a Large-Scale Textile Factory, Factory Site in Guangzhou Bay, Luo Tingyu in Charge of Preparations, Machines Have Been Surveyed and Can Be Started in About Two Months <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special News] Since the outbreak of the war, China's industry has been severely devastated. The major factories in the war zones or occupied areas have successively shut down due to the war. Some have even been coerced by the enemy or simply seized, which has had a great impact on China's war resources. For this reason, the authorities are actively advocating the development of the western region and formulating measures to aid and award industrial and mining enterprises, so that factories can move into the interior as much as possible to maintain the safety of wartime production. It is found that although China's textile industry is still in its infancy in recent years, it has gradually developed, with a thriving trend. Before the war, silk factories, yarn factories, textile factories, and so on were mostly concentrated in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the two provinces have successively become war zones, the land, houses, and machinery of these factories have been occupied by the enemy, claiming them as their own, and their products are massively dumped into the interior. Therefore, the textile products required by China after the war are all dependent on foreign goods, or even enemy goods being sold under false pretenses, resulting in capital outflows and a significant impact. The authorities have recently actively improved cotton production in Sichuan, and invested in the establishment of large-scale yarn factories by the banking sector and are taking steps to remedy this situation. Recently, yarn factories that have moved to Chongqing include Qingxin, Yufeng, Yuhua, and many others. Other factories of the same nature are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. According to reliable sources, Mr. Chen Jitang, the former commander-in-chief of the First Army Group of Guangdong Province, also feels that developing industry is an urgent task for the current nation-building. Therefore, he has spent tens of millions of dollars to establish a large-scale textile factory in Guangzhou Bay. When Mr. Chen was in power in Guangdong, he built a provincial textile factory, which achieved excellent results. Its products were comparable to imported goods. Since the outbreak of the war, the provincial textile factory has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, and work has been suspended. After the fall of Guangzhou, the machines were not moved out and were automatically destroyed. However, the loss was extremely heavy. Mr. Chen recently set up a large-scale textile factory in Guangzhou Bay, heard that it want to thoroughly practice its advocacy. The matter has been in progress for several months. It has been heard that all the machinery has been ordered from a certain foreign company, and most of it has been shipped to Hong Kong properly. The person in charge of preparation is Mr. Luo Tingyu, the former factory manager of the Zhandong Provincial Textile Factory. Mr. Luo has been actively carrying out everything between Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay in recent days. It is said that construction can be started in about two months. It has also been heard that the factory needs many workers. In addition to using some of the old workers from the provincial textile factory, a large number of skilled workers will be recruited in Hong Kong to increase production efficiency. All the products in the future will be transported to the interior for sales, so the decision to set it in Guangzhou Bay is because it is convenient for transportation and there is no fear of a shortage of raw materials.</p>
<h3 id="e53">A Large Quantity of Toxic Substances Smuggled from Xiamen into the Mainland of Fujian and Guangdong: Last Year, 30,000 Kilograms of Opium Were Shipped Out; Please Strictly Guard Against the Poisoning Policy of the ×× People <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] × aims to poison our country; therefore, it openly sells drugs in various occupied areas. This is true not only in North China and Central China but also in South China. Its sinister intentions are truly hateful. After × launched the war in South China, it resumed its anesthetizing policy in the occupied areas of Guangdong and Fujian to poison our people. In addition to opening gambling dens to lure our people, it also vigorously promoted toxic substances such as opium, red pills, and white powder. According to refugees who recently fled from Xiamen to Fuzhou and then transferred to Hong Kong, the toxic substances in Guangdong and Fujian are all imported from Xiamen and Kinmen. Currently, × has large-scale drug manufacturing facilities in both locations, with a significant stockpile of drugs. On a previous day, × shipped 1,000 boxes of opium out of Xiamen. Although the destination is unknown, most people believe it was transported into the occupied areas of Guangdong. Each box of opium weighs 25 kilograms, totaling 30,000 kilograms. It is by the grace of the × people that these drugs are being transported into the mainland to poison our compatriots, causing countless people to lose their health. Before I left Xiamen, I also heard that there were more than 500 boxes of opium stored in Kinmen, ready to be shipped to various locations. In addition to selling drugs in the occupied areas, × also uses traitors and bandits, offering them substantial profits, to secretly transport and sell drugs. Therefore, along the coast of Fujian Province, the smuggling of private opium and other drugs is rampant. It is hoped that our authorities will take measures to strictly prevent this. Otherwise, our people will suffer so deeply from the poison that they cannot be saved. (Jun)</p>

<p>[Lian County Correspondence] After assuming office, Li Hanhun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has greatly reformed the provincial administration in various aspects. Recently, in view of the weaknesses of past administration, which lay in the lack of qualified personnel, it has been decided to organize an administrative personnel training institute to recruit talent from all over the province with high school education or above, and concentrate on training them, so as to cultivate a large number of cadres to assist the government in implementing new policies. The institute was established a few days ago and is scheduled to open in Lian County in mid-next month. Chairman Li will concurrently serve as the director, and Lu Zongqi has been appointed as the director of education. The training subjects are divided into military affairs, politics, hygiene, production, cooperation, etc. The first phase will train 2,000 personnel, with a duration of three months. The trainees will temporarily consist of the model soldiers and civilians of the Xijiang Administrative Office, members of the women and children's work corps, faculty and staff of Guangning Buxi School, and former staff of the Guangzhou Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, as well as faculty and staff of Guangzhou schools. In terms of the distribution of personnel, the women, children, and soldiers of the Xijiang Administrative Office account for 630 people, who have now arrived in Lian County under the leadership of Chen Mingshu for centralized training. Staff of the Social Affairs Bureau and faculty and staff of Guangzhou schools have also arrived in part. There are also more than 1,000 civil servants and school faculty and staff residing in Hong Kong and Macao who can also participate in the training. At present, all preparations for the institute have been completed and training will begin in mid-next month.</p>

<h3 id="e56">From Shantou to Saigon (Continued) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Hua You</p>
<p>This is unreasonable and simply doesn’t make sense. Even though our country is poor, surely our citizens can afford to wear new clothes? Even if we take a step back, does it mean that white people can wear clothes but yellow people can’t? Although the person who had their new cotton garment stripped off was a coolie, labor is sacred, especially since the French authorities are now vigorously promoting the eight-hour workday! (Saigon is currently implementing an eight-hour workday.) I believe this is a great insult. If the consulate officials could protest based on reason, I believe the civilized French would have nothing to say. I also have a wish: that the consulate, in its official capacity, could ask the French colonial government to consider the situation of our many overseas Chinese. How can they bear it when they don’t have clean clothes to change into after bathing, and when they don’t have blankets to cover themselves at night? If they cannot bear it, then they should allow our overseas Chinese to bring a blanket and several changes of clothes with them when they come ashore.</p>
<p>B. The consulate should send personnel to investigate how much luggage is damaged by the coolies hired by the Qifu with the blood and sweat of the overseas Chinese after each ship docks. Then, with detailed statistics, see how much money is lost per ship. Then, in the name of the consul, instruct the leaders of the Qifu to send people to supervise the work of those coolies. If they intentionally damage the luggage of the overseas Chinese, they can be dismissed. This way, they will not dare to arbitrarily damage people’s belongings. As for the loss of luggage in the clothing box pavilion and the dereliction of duty by the "Ma Zhens," the heads of the Qifu gangs should be ordered to thoroughly investigate. In addition, at the entrance of the clothing box pavilion, Annamese vagrants often snatch money and belongings from overseas Chinese. The Qifu should also be ordered to hire "undercover agents" to monitor the situation and reduce the unexpected losses of the general overseas Chinese. Two.</p>
<p>If the consulate officials can earnestly implement the above matters, I believe it can attract the support of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese. I originally wanted to personally explain these opinions to Deputy Consul Zhuo, but unfortunately, I was busy traveling by car during those two months in Annam. Although Deputy Consul Zhuo hosted a farewell banquet before I left, there was originally a great opportunity for a detailed discussion. However, on that night, the situation in Czechoslovakia in Europe was very tense, and everyone’s attention was focused on the issue of the outbreak of World War II. Thus, a great opportunity was lightly missed. Now I am writing it here, and I don’t know if it will attract the attention of the officials at the Saigon consulate. Tightness is another issue.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Hong Kong-Macau Inter-Port Football Tournament, which has been held twice, will be hosted by Hong Kong this year, around March or April. In the past two tournaments, the Macau team won, but the Hong Kong team only sent second division players as representatives, because the goal was not to improve football skills, but only to meet Macau's request and maintain relations with the local football community. Recently, the Macau side wanted to take this opportunity to improve the level of Macau's football skills and increase the interest of spectators. A few days ago, they sent a letter to the Hong Kong Football Association, requesting that they send a strong team to the meeting, preferably composed purely of first division members. The Hong Kong Football Association will discuss this at a meeting during the day before making a decision. In addition, when the Philippine team left Hong Kong recently, the team leader, Carl Volkers, told members of the Hong Kong Football Association that they hoped the Hong Kong team could invite Li Huitang to accompany them on their trip to the Philippines in April, because the people there were deeply impressed by Li Huitang and wanted to see him again. It is said that the Hong Kong Football Association has conveyed Carl’s intention to Li Huitang. According to Li Huitang's statement to reporters, if the Hong Kong side prepares to send a team to the Philippines and I can be selected, and if I can get leave from the Swedish trading company, then I am very willing to serve the Hong Kong team.

<h3 id="e62">Shanghai Football Charity Match: Chinese United Team Suffers Miserable Defeat: Western United Wins Narrowly 3-2: Lu Zhongen Carelessly Loses the Game <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[22nd Shanghai Correspondence] The Chinese-Western Charity Football Match, sponsored by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association, between the Chinese United Team and the Western United Team, once again met at the Yiyuan Stadium on the day after the Lunar New Year's Day (20th) in the afternoon at three o'clock. The two sides were evenly matched and the game was extremely intense. After one and a half hours of battle, they tied at two goals each and could not be determined to be the winner. Until the last five minutes, unfortunately, due to the mistake of goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, the yellow-haired Robbert Stolov took advantage of the situation and shot the ball into the empty goal, easily rolling it into the net. The Chinese United Team then lost again by a score of 2-3. The Chinese United Team had already lost 1-2 in the Christmas charity match last year, and it is a pity that they still could not take revenge this time. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, the Yiyuan spectators were packed with people, totaling no less than 10,000 people. The income reached more than 6,000 yuan. After the game, the ball was auctioned off, and Gao Ao’de, Chairman of the Lido Sports Association, generously donated 400 yuan to buy it. The first match between Lido and the Army United Team is scheduled to be held at the Yiyuan Stadium on the morning of the 5th of next month (Sunday).</p>

<p>Kick-off by the Dutch Consul</p>
<p>The kick-off ceremony was performed by Paul Swelheim, Consul General of the Netherlands in Shanghai, President of the International Relief Committee, accompanied by Li Guiyong, Executive Director of the Relief Committee. Due to the heavy rain the day before yesterday, the field was muddy and slippery, and the performance of both sides was greatly diminished. The Chinese United forward, Xiao Dai, was absent and replaced by Li Yichen. The performance was still a perfect match and even more ferocious than the Western United Team, which was the most satisfactory. Tan Fuzhen's center was unable to exert his full strength, and Xu Chenghun and Zhang Xueyao also missed the team from time to time, causing Van Show and Fortune to be extraordinarily active. Because the rear line could not provide sufficient support, the forward line was often seen returning in vain. The Western United forwards did not cooperate as well as the Chinese United Five Tigers, but the center defense line was strong and terrifying, especially Max Gan, who stood out from the crowd. Willie, Wallie's defense was the best performance, saving countless dangerous balls. The last barrier of the Chinese United Five Tigers, the rapid fireballs, failed to break through because of this person.</p>
<p>First Record</p>
<p>After both sides made contact, Sun Jinshun opened the scoring. Western United's Tom passed to Robert Tschi and scored three consecutive goals. In the first half, the Chinese United Team was 1-2 behind. In the second half, Xu Wenkui scored with a header, tying the score. Unfortunately, in the last five minutes, Lu Zhongen rushed out, trying to intercept Van Show, but unexpectedly Van Show picked him off, and Robert Stolov easily rolled the ball into the empty goal. After the kick-off, the Western United Team attacked fiercely, but Robert Tschi's handball sent the ball into the Western United area. Sun Jinshun kicked the ball fiercely, but it was caught by Willie Watt. Jia Youliang dribbled the ball forward, and Li Yichen's shot in front of the goal was also caught by Watt. After fifteen minutes of stalemate, Cao Youliang hooked the ball, Li Yichen headed it to Sun Jinshun, and Sun Jinshun kicked it in, opening the scoring. Van Show passed the ball beautifully to the center, but the three forwards missed the opportunity one after another. Thomson was quick-footed and tied the score. It was only three minutes after losing the goal. Youliang hooked the ball again, and Li Yichen's attack was saved, and Xu Wenkui added a kick, but it crossed the horizontal bar, and the good opportunity was lost. It was a pity. In the 25th minute, Robert Stolov received a pass from Tom and passed the ball to the goal. The long-legged Lu failed to save the ball, and the ball rolled towards the goal. Robert Tschi rushed up and pushed it straight into the net. The first half ended with Western United leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Miserable Defeat by One Goal</p>
<p>After switching sides to fight again, Chinese United's Cao Qiuting passed the ball to Xu Wenkui, Xu picked it forward, and Li Yichen shot on the ground, but the ball bounced back from Willie's foot. Xu caught it again and hit it again, but it was kicked out by Willie. Before long, the Chinese United Team got a free kick opportunity. Sun Jinshun kicked the ball from 25 yards away from the goal, with a stern and unusual speed, but it was caught by Willie. Youliang, Iron Legs and Wenkui took turns to ask for it again, but Willie was agile and all failed. After 17 minutes, Jia Youliang cut into the bottom line, and Xu Wenkui was waiting for the right moment, heading the ball directly into the net. The clear and beautiful goal won warm applause, tying the score. Western United counterattacked again and again, but to no avail. After a stalemate until the last five minutes, Van Show got a shot from Fortune, dribbled the ball in, and Lu Zhongen rushed out in desperation, but was picked off by Van Show in the middle, and Robert Stolov reaped the benefits and shot the ball into the empty goal. Before long, the game ended, and the Chinese United Team was miserably defeated 2-3.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Chongqing sports have recently undergone a myriad of changes. The Ministry of Education has decided to participate in the World Games to be held in Helsinki in 1940. In terms of ball sports, two athletes will be selected for football and basketball (but there is no basketball in this World Games). It is planned to give up participation in track and field, but the results of the marathon and race walking in the last World Games were still considerable, and personnel will be sent to perform. During the Sixth National Sports Discussion Conference convened by the Ministry of Education here, more than 40 people attended, including Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Cheng Dengke, and Jiang Xiangqing. It was resolved that school sports must be included in the entrance examination, and students who fail sports courses cannot graduate. Sports teachers in all schools must be graduates of sports colleges. Social sports performers with excellent results may be reported by the local competent authorities to the Ministry of Education for the issuance of honorary medals.</p>

<p>Chen Feixiang, a champion boxer from North Malaya, is currently taking a vacation and passed through Hong Kong from Guilin. The Hong Kong University Boxing Class, due to Chen’s reputation, specifically selected several experienced White Russian boxers and sent letters inviting Chen to perform several times, which was well received by all parties. Chen previously studied in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Far Eastern Aviation School in Hong Kong. After graduating, he participated in the anti-Japanese war. During the Battle of Nanxiong, we shot down six Japanese heavy bombers, and Chen also contributed significantly, for which he was awarded a major merit.

<p>Since the Hong Kong Basketball Federation produced a new committee this year, it has spared no effort in carrying out its affairs. Recently, the registration for the Men’s Open Basketball Charity Tournament began, and all teams participated enthusiastically. The deadline is today, and the competition schedule will be prepared and the tournament will begin. However, the Shen Bao Cup, which was previously sponsored by Shen Bao, has not yet been held. The Federation has not been able to take care of both because it has been busy with the Men’s Open Tournament recently. It is now decided to convene a meeting after the Men’s Open Tournament, and then discuss and determine the holding of the tournament.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Discussion on Triple Jump Training (1) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>(1) Selection of Personnel</p>
<p>The triple jump is a continuous running and jumping movement. There are many things to pay attention to in the training of athletes. The first point is the selection of personnel. The selection of personnel is very important, because the physical condition directly affects the performance. Therefore, before training, the primary task is the selection of athletes, and the standard for selection should be determined by all the elements of the sport. In my personal experience, it can be divided into the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Those with longer lower limbs, relatively short upper bodies, large leg strength, and a talent for sprinting.</p>
<p>(2) Those with thick thighs and strong muscle contraction force, and short calves with strong leverage. These are generally good jumpers.</p>
<p>(2) Basic Training</p>
<p>Basic training is indispensable for any sport, because basic training can directly improve our posture and increase our physical strength, and improve the familiarity of experienced movements, which indirectly affects the results – performance. Basic training can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Sprint training of 50 to 100 meters. This type of training is very important, because the triple jump is a continuous running and long jump movement. Therefore, before we train jumping, we must have 50 to 100 meters of training to cultivate a healthy sprinting force.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening leg strength is a more closely related training. When striding or jumping, the strength and distance of the legs are of great importance. If we want excellent results, we must develop strength. Strengthening means that the object of fatigue. When using both legs, you will not feel tired, and the more you use it, the more pleasant it feels. This is a symbol of developing leg strength. For this type of training, you should usually do more elastic lower limb movements. The method can be freely chosen and does not need to be restricted.</p>
<p>(3) Mimicking the final posture A. Sit on a low stool, stretch both feet forward with toes pointing upwards, raise both hands backwards, and lean the upper body slightly forward. At this time, forcefully swing both hands forward, and take advantage of the momentum to lean the upper body forward, causing the body to stand up. Do this eight to sixteen times every morning. Once you are familiar with this exercise, continue to do the second one. B. Preparation: Stand with both feet together and knees slightly bent, lean the upper body slightly forward, and swing your hands back. The center of gravity is in the back. It is bound to fall backwards. Immediately swing both hands forward, straighten your waist, and straighten your knees, shifting the center of gravity forward. At this time, step forward with your left or right foot to maintain balance. Do this eight to sixteen times every morning. The lower you fall (backwards) and then get up, the better. When practicing, it is best to go to a sand pit for practical practice. If limited by the environment, you can practice on a mat, but do not practice on hard ground to avoid the danger of falling backwards.</p>
<p>(3) The Relationship Between Takeoff and Foot Placement</p>
<p>What we should know is the first point of restriction in the rules of this sport, which is the problem of the takeoff board. If we want to solve this problem and achieve a safe takeoff, we must work on measuring the foot placement. The method of measuring foot placement is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Measure the first foot placement by measuring backwards from the takeoff board. This measurement method is best done using your personal stride measurement, but when measuring, you should pay attention to which foot you are using for the takeoff. When using a certain foot to take off, use that foot to first step onto the takeoff board and jump outwards to measure (the stride is the same as a formal run and jump). To a certain distance where the foot lands, then take half a step back to get the first foot placement. For example, if you use your right foot to take off, use your right foot to first step onto the takeoff board, run to a certain distance, and then take half a step back from where the right foot lands (because the stride will definitely be very wide during a formal run) to get the first foot placement. However, the length of the distance from the takeoff board to the first foot placement should be limited by the individual's sprinting ability, which is about eleven meters.</p>
<p>(2) Measure the starting point between eight and nine steps outwards from the first foot placement. The measurement method is the same as the first foot placement.</p>
<p>This method of measuring and applying foot placement should be practiced regularly to avoid temporary confusion. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Entertainment… The Romance of Marie Antoinette</p>
<p>Marfe Antofnette</p>
<p>This film, in every aspect, is worthy of being called a great success. Every scene in the film is filled with moving romance and tense, terrifying tragic tones. At the same time, Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power, in their first collaboration, are even more able to vividly portray the tragic fate of the last queen of France. Their acting skills in the film have reached the highest peak of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer plays an Austrian princess full of passion and hope in the film. Unfortunately, she marries Louis XVI, who is naturally dull. Disappointed, she indulges in a luxurious and licentious life, and falls in love with Duke of Hua Chen. However, due to wasting national funds and satisfying her desires, she does not gain the understanding of the people. Coupled with Louis' mediocrity and incompetence, the people are plunged into misery, and the revolution breaks out. In the chaos of this era, her extremely tragic fate is created.</p>
<p>The film brings this moving historical event to life on the silver screen. The scenery and costumes are also extremely magnificent. At the same time, the film provides a very realistic depiction of the queen's extravagant and licentious life, the environment that created her personality, and the situation of the French Revolution at that time, which further increases the realism of the film. This film "The Romance of Marie Antoinette" is a work that is extremely worthy of introducing to the audience.</p>

<p>Aviation films produced in color are indeed successful in terms of color. In "Goddess of Crocodile Island," there was a scene of an airplane flying in the sky. The bright colors of the sky did leave a very beautiful impression. In this film, this point is even more fully developed. The sky is too beautiful. Perhaps many people will want to fly an airplane leisurely in that blue and lovely sky after watching this film.</p>
<p>The story seems a bit too long, but it narrates the history of the American aviation industry from the 1930s to the present, with three young people who have devoted their lives to aviation as the main characters, which is quite moving.</p>
<p>Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland, the two male protagonists, are competent. The female protagonist is a newcomer, Ruth Gamble. Judging from this film, she is a very promising new star.</p>
<p>Dahua… Princess and the Butler</p>
<p>Baroness And The Butler</p>
<p>Starring William Powell and Anna Bella. The plot is slightly lacking in coherence, but the dialogue is humorous. Those seeking happiness can watch it.</p>
<p>Guotai… Detective Wife</p>
<p>Theres Alway A Woman</p>
<p>Starring Joan Blondell and Melvin Douglas. The backbone of the plot is a detective case, but because the performance is relaxed, lively, and comically absurd, there is no sense of boredom like a vulgar detective film. However, this lighthearted tone destroys all the tense scenes in the film. Nevertheless, this is still a film worth watching.</p>

<p>— Dun Sheng</p>
<p>Discussion on the Poetry Recitation Movement</p>
<p>Poetry, the trumpet of this great era, has been tragically echoing in the hearts of the masses during the War of Resistance. Its voice bursts with red blood, hot tears, and a tidal wave of patriotic enthusiasm. It calls out, it rages, it fights, and the flames of the War of Resistance melt its gorgeous clothes. It has become a Guanxi warrior shaking hands with the masses.</p>
<p>Everything is subject to the War of Resistance, and everything is running forward with the pace of the great era. The poetry recitation movement unfolded with the war of national liberation. There was a groundbreaking attempt in Northern Shaanxi. Afterwards, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places also responded. Because it was an attempt, we should not be too anxious to seek perfect results. Defects can be left to future efforts to overcome. The movement itself has already attracted the attention of the masses and has become an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Fifteen of us, carrying the banner of the "Guangya Cultural Work Group," came to the front, wanting to use our pens and our mouths to sow the seeds of culture in the countryside and on the battlefield. The members of our team are young students and literary and artistic workers. Now, as soldiers running to the front to work, we naturally cannot forget our mission and our powerful weapon—the pen in our hand.</p>
<p>The third literary and artistic symposium after arriving in Zhaoqing was held in a small teahouse on the riverbank outside the city. Surrounded by green mountains and clear waters, the fifteen of us began to discuss the issue of poetry. We spoke, debated, and the atmosphere was as lively as the river water. We decided on several outlines, and everyone busily started working, printing the outlines and remembered poems into a small booklet. We prepared to hold a poetry recitation movement rally the next night.</p>
<p>In the evening, the setting sun gathered its remaining glow. One by one, young people, literary and artistic enthusiasts, men and women, walked in with a group of people who loved to come. By seven o'clock, the ground in the small courtyard was already filled with people.</p>
<p>The lovely lights shone on this group of young people fighting on the front lines with artistic interests, breaking the ground to open a poetry recitation movement rally. Because it was the first time, everyone held fresh interest, and the outlines and poetry books were distributed to every participating friend. They looked at it as if they were looking at a mysterious thing.</p>
<p>After the chairman gave the opening speech, the chairman first recited one of his own new poems. The atmosphere immediately became lively, and everyone nibbled on melon seeds and sipped tea while thinking and listening.</p>
<p>First, we had a discussion on the outline of "Poetry, the Bugle in the War of Resistance." Everyone unanimously agreed that the flames of the War of Resistance had forged poetry into steel, and the big hand of the era had pushed poetry closer to the masses. The corrupt, the aesthetic, and the decadent were all dead. Poetry has embarked on a popular and strong road. The poetry recitation movement is a way to get closer to the masses.</p>
<p>Second, we talked about the content and form of recited poetry. Everyone felt that the form should be creative and fresh, while the content must be closely linked to the rhythm of the times, connected to the lives of the masses, and keep pace with the reality of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Third, we launched a war of words on the difference between mountain songs, folk songs, drum lyrics, ditties, and recited poems. Some argued that recited poetry has its own characteristics and must not be confused with other categories. Although the form of mountain songs and ditties can be temporarily used before a new form is established.</p>
<p>Fourth, when it came to the method of reciting poetry, most advocated using dialects, supplemented by Mandarin, so that it could be more effective. The reciter should be expressive and should first let themselves and the poetry they want to recite merge into one. Everyone had no second opinion. Someone proposed the method of reciting in makeup. Some people agreed, while others held the opposite view, arguing that makeup would destroy the atmosphere of the poem. But the latter finally succumbed after a fierce debate.</p>
<p>The last item was how to launch the poetry recitation movement. "Don't let go of every recitation opportunity," a friend shouted with a smile. Everyone laughed. "What else?" "Also—organize more poetry recitations to create a large number of cadres."</p>
<p>Everyone silently acknowledged these two suggestions.</p>
<p>"Please, advanced figures in the poetry world, write more poems? Recite, oh!" Who is saying this again.</p>
<p>The conclusion was read out. Several friends who wrote poetry recited a few pieces in different tones, postures, and languages. Everyone's heart was pounding with emotion, and every soul was immersed in poetry.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned, and everyone walked away slowly with attachment. At this time, the moon in the sky was like a lamp, shining on this group of young people walking on the way home.</p>
<p>Postscript: The above story is one of the propaganda work that the author and his teachers and friends did at the front some time ago. Now, although it has been many years, I still feel that it has a profound meaning, so I especially record it.</p>

<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Let us unleash an even more robust stride</p>
<p>Under the same belief</p>
<p>Under the same goal</p>
<p>We have already forged a pair of legs in the furnace of history</p>
<p>That dare to go to heaven and dare to go to earth</p>
<p>The future may be lurking with more hardships</p>
<p>The road ahead may be even more winding</p>
<p>But let it be</p>
<p>We have no time to worry</p>
<p>Winter is followed by spring</p>
<p>A single blade of grass cannot be crushed by the snow.</p>
<p>Let us unleash an even more robust stride</p>
<p>We are the sharp-shooters of the national revolutionary war</p>
<p>Look, the fluttering flag is already predicting tomorrow's victory.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Current Path of Literary and Artistic Authors <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Chenghui</p>
<p>Since the sound of the War of Resistance cannons, Hong Kong has become a haven for refugees. Many wealthy people are unwilling to go to the rear to do war work, nor are they willing to live under the sun flag, so they have traveled thousands of miles to enter this territory. Since the fall of Macau and Guangzhou, the number of people coming here to seek refuge has been like a flood that has burst its banks, flowing in continuously. Among this so-called group of refugees, there are capitalists, merchants, workers, students, and the general public. In addition to this, there are many more, literary and artistic authors that I want to talk about now. Here, you cannot hear the shrill alarms and the rumbling of cannons, nor can you see the tragic and cruel destruction. Instead, there is jazz music and a peaceful scene. The rich, of course, enjoy themselves as much as possible, living a leisurely life, while the poor are plagued by hunger and cold. As for the general literary and artistic writers, because most of them are middle-class, they cannot afford to fully enjoy themselves, but they are not reduced to hunger and cold. However, most of them do not have a fixed occupation here. Apart from writing a few articles, there is nothing else to do. Therefore, they will also while away their good time in the crackling sounds of mahjong, and when they are bored, they will go to the brightly lit dance halls to seek stimulation. As for their works, I think they can only rely on their intuitive imagination to write romantic works. To be frank, I think it is very difficult for works produced in this way to achieve excellent results. Literary and artistic works, in addition to their own artistic expression, actually bear a special mission of propaganda, especially during this time of national resistance. Although I dare not agree with the high-minded disciples of Bai Suifeng, who again advocate art for art's sake, I dare not sympathize with literary and artistic writers who hide in remote heavens, lead a useless life, and write things that are imagined solely from newspaper materials. I think now is the best time for literary and artistic authors to develop their talents. They should go to the front lines of the War of Resistance, or to the rear areas related to the War of Resistance, to conduct careful and arduous searches and observations, and to gain practical, true experiences. Only in this way can they faithfully and accurately reflect the reality of the War of Resistance, fulfill the responsibilities of a writer, and not lose the artistic value and mission of the work itself. However, many writers stranded in Hong Kong are doing the opposite. They are afraid of hard work and are unwilling to embark on this correct path, but instead hide in this paradise of paper and gold, dreaming a good dream in an ivory tower. I think it is really a pity.</p>
<p>The front lines of direct conflict, the guerrilla areas of roundabout flanking attacks, and Yan'an, the ancient city that trains combat power, and Kunming, the rear full of vigor, are all the best places for young writers to go. In these places, life is so full of life, excitement, and meaning. I dare not hope that they can implement the claims of some critics, firing a gun with one hand and writing a novel with the other, nor do I hope that they can certainly produce great works like Malraux and Shankel, but living there, they can always write more fulfilling works, and the reality of the War of Resistance will naturally be reflected more deeply and clearly. Therefore, I hope that all the writers stranded in Hong Kong can resolutely embark on this path of progress.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Words of Lung Pain <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>In recent days, whenever I sit at my desk to write, I always feel a burst of pain in the tip of my lungs. At first, I was a little frightened by this sudden pain, but later, I clearly knew that it was because I was writing too much and for too long, and that my lungs were causing trouble, so I dismissed half of my fear.</p>
<p>Isn't that the truth? It's not surprising to have the good fortune to live in Hong Kong and dream in a paradise. What is surprising is that a lower-class refugee, whose food, clothing, and shelter are all poor, and who does not have the bright sunshine to shine on him, or the nourishment of chicken, milk, and beef, does not suffer from lung disease!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was talking to a friend and unintentionally mentioned the issue of lung disease. The friend actually stroked his chest and coughed heavily three times, saying, "I have long felt it, I have Hong Kong disease!"</p>
<p>"Why don't you take good care of yourself?" At first, I really wanted to shout this out with sincerity, but when I thought of his dilapidated room on the third floor, crowded with broken furniture and adults and children, and the income that only allowed him to eat porridge for a month, I swallowed this half-hearted, half-mocking false consolation. Instead, I said with compassion and sympathy: "I am the same!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Is that so? How can that be?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Why can't it be? The privilege of the poor is to suffer more pain!" I said.</p>
<p>"I have a way to cure lung disease!" my friend said slowly. I thought he must have been using the usual set of milk and eggs to comfort people. But he said seriously:</p>
<p>"There is a way to cure lung disease! That is to believe that you don't have lung disease and not to worry..."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes! I think this is the only way for us refugees that is free and easy to do!"</p>
<p>I was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Last night, I suddenly felt a faint pain in my lungs again. It seemed to strongly refute my determination to not believe that I had lung disease, and I also thought to myself, since I really have the disease, how can I deceive myself and say that I don't have it? I fundamentally overturned the friend's advice. But besides the friend's well-intentioned method, there seemed to be no other good prescription. Milk, eggs, and sunshine were not something everyone could enjoy.</p>
<p>I have a wish in my heart. I can't die of lung disease no matter what, and I can't die in this paradise. If the god of lung disease really descends on me, I am willing to step into the cannon fire and die a happy death. In our turbulent times, what is there to worry about? When we cannot eat our fill, cannot cover our bodies, and are regarded as strange faces, discarded and despised, the god of lung disease is indeed our honored guest. But I don't think so. I still hope that I can bring a healthy body and return to the embrace of my motherland.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Hand-to-Hand Combat <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinsheng</p>
<p>One of the War Zone Sightings</p>
<p>The poor Second Army Group, Wang's unit of the 31st Division, took advantage of the dusk to attack the × people fiercely in northern Lu, and the two sides engaged in extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat. One of our soldiers was exceptionally brave and personally killed five or six Japanese pirates. Later, because he ran out of bullets and broke his broadsword, and his legs were hit by two bullets, he was so exhausted that he could barely stand. He ran into a nearby trench. As soon as he sat down, another person ran in in a panic and hurriedly hid inside. Our soldier thought it was his own brother, so he shrank inside and made a little room for him to squat down. The person who came in also thought that the inside was his own people and sat down. Neither of them said a word. After a good while, the sound of killing outside subsided. The person who had been hiding came out and left. Our soldier also came out and walked a few steps. Suddenly, he realized that the person in front was a × person, not his own brother, so he quietly clenched the empty gun in his hand, endured the pain in his legs, and ran up like a lightning bolt. He struck the × person head-on. The × person "ah"ed and fell to the ground. He also dropped the empty gun in his hand and pounced on the ground. The two wrestled into a ball, rolling around, supporting and biting each other. Finally, the × person was strangled to death by our soldier, and when our soldier returned to the division headquarters, his clothes were all torn, and he was bleeding profusely.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Night in Anpu <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Du Wenhui</p>
<p>——A Plague-ridden Town on Jì Nán Road——</p>
<p>As I sat in the eastern compartment of the raft, crossing this final stretch of the Sha River, the sun was already setting. Four strong men, grasping long poles, thrust them into the white sand of the riverbed, where beautiful ripples floated, and desperately pushed forward. The verdant white poplars on the riverbank sparkled with the golden-emerald light reflected from the setting sun. Flocks of geese frolicked under the shade of the trees, seemingly comforting the loneliness of the journey for us passengers sitting in the carriage.</p>
<p>I was deeply moved as I gazed at the clear river water, the solitary masts in the distant harbor, and the tattered fishing nets drying on the riverbank. A flock of mountain sparrows flew across the clear sky, and the serene banks were filled with lush spring colors. Spring had returned! It was a lovely season! However, I, sitting in the carriage, was a person burdened with the weight of national salvation and embarking on a journey. The spring colors of this land were merely a weary comfort to me. I had no intention of lingering; I was only worried about the unfamiliar land and the difficult, unknown fate that lay ahead!</p>
<p>While I was lost in contemplation, the carriage had already left the raft and was heading towards the endless yellow dirt road. This was considered the flattest section of the road from Conghua County to Anpu, so the carriage moved particularly quickly. The sides of the road were planted with countless two- or three-foot-tall dwarf cypresses. The carriage seemed to be moving as calmly as if it were on a tree-lined road in the city. After passing this area of green shade, the light of the setting sun streamed into the eastern window, dazzling the eyes of the passengers. After a thirty-mile ride at breakneck speed, the snow-white roof ridge of Anpu East Station was already visible at the bend. A hint of pleasant, bitter smiles appeared on the weary faces of the passengers.</p>
<p>Getting off the carriage, I brushed off the yellow dust that covered my body. A young assistant from a hotel came over from behind the carriage to take back the two leather briefcases, and led me out of the station's dirt road, then turned onto a cement stone street. On both sides were mixed-color two-story houses, the shops completely locked, covered with cobwebs, and the streets were as desolate as death. It was obvious that the population of this small town could not be large, but why were there so many stars? I asked the assistant traveling with me out of curiosity.</p>
<p>"Don't you know, sir? There's a disease going around here that kills people very quickly," he said to me, as if very mysterious, pursing his lips.</p>
<p>"What disease? What disease?" I asked him quickly. He seemed a little terrified and clumsy, stammering slowly for a long time:</p>
<p>"In the past few weeks, more than a hundred people have died here. When they die, their bodies are completely black... I don't know what the disease is... but some people say it's because there are too many rats. The disease breaks out every year at this time... Originally, this place used to be very prosperous, but because of this situation, it appears desolate. People have fled to nearby villages, and only return to town after this festival. It's really not easy to do business these days. If it's not an epidemic, it's fear of bandits and war... And since this place is close to the sea, Japanese warships often linger there, and enemy planes often come here to scout. It's a waste of time to do business here!" he said, seemingly very emotional. Looking at his somewhat haggard, ashen face, I felt a sense of sympathy and terror.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid here?..."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid, because the disease is only present in those..." He pointed to the dirty, dark alley we were passing through. "It won't happen on the main street; but what can you do if you're afraid? These days, death is as common as eating at home. Alas!..." He sighed with great emotion.</p>
<p>We had already stepped into the gate of the two hotels. The owner sitting in the accounting room stood up as soon as he saw me and said very politely:</p>
<p>"Looking for a room? Sir. Very good! Very good! Take this gentleman up to the third floor."</p>
<p>The assistant carried our briefcases and went straight up to the top floor along the wooden stairs, placing them in the south-facing room. There was a wooden window, an old wooden bed, a table, a washstand, and a few stools. After I washed my face, I opened the wooden window and looked out onto a veranda. Beyond the veranda was the lush woodland of Anpu Park. The sky was full of golden twilight, and in the distance stretched the endless green fields of rice, contrasting with the black roof ridges nearby, showing a strange disharmony! A strange sense of deathly silence!</p>
