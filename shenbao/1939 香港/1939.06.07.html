<h3 id="c1">論目前的戰局，戰略與戰術　“以全力求小勝，以大力打小仗” <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（特約通訊員敏之五月卅一日桂林航函）某軍事專家最近在桂發表關於目前抗戰形勢及戰略與戰術問題的演講，頗爲各方重視，茲特紀其全文如次：（編者按，本港報紙　有刊載其一部者，爲便讀者窺其全豹，特爲刊其全文）</p>
<p>抗戰進入第二期以後，×人在進攻的策略方面已有變更，在我們雖然戰略方面還是以持久對付　决，可是戰爭指導的方法上也較第一期不同。</p>
<p>今天應該討論的第一個問題，就是如何達到持久戰的目的，在目前也就是怎樣達到消耗×人的力量和增加自己的力量的目的。</p>
<p>拖而勝之還是戰而勝之！</p>
<p>在這問題上有一部分人對持久作戰獲得勝利也同具信念，不過他們把持久看作拖延，認爲只要拖得久，×人必然自己崩潰，因此主力决戰需要避免，爲了要拖延所以還是採用過去以空間換取時間的方法，卽權續撤退。直退到更遼遠的邊境上去，也不要緊，×人一崩潰，我們就可以全師而還南京，其實我們如果把戰略建築在這種拖延的辦法上是非常危險的。</p>
<p>因爲×人目前正利用着這種心理，向這個弱點進攻：自從汪精衛出走以後，×人進攻已有了更巧妙的方法，還因爲汪精衛明瞭中國的內情自然比×人更淸楚，所以說目前×人的進攻，是向我們的薄弱部分擴展，乘　而入：他把中國中央與地方之間，地方與地方之間，軍隊與軍隊之間，黨派與黨派之間，作爲他進攻的目標，所以我們如果還主張拖而勝之，結果必然變成我們對後方準備的消極，對前方乘機出擊，殲滅×人的消極，對×人後方進行堅苦的消極，總括說一切準備消極，因此日後的戰略反攻也不能做到。</p>
<p>所以我們對×二期作戰必須是戰而勝之，不是拖而勝之，而是積極的在戰鬥中獲得勝利。因為要戰而勝之，我們就必然要使全國力量走向堅苦的前途，不致內爲這種消極，以致×人有運用力量運用爪牙破壞我們的可能。</p>
<p>因此我們必須用運用消耗戰儘力求勝，只有積極地求得勝利才能使我們對抗戰前途不致消極，對工作設計有把握，而更加積極起來。</p>
<p>全面的跳躍作戰</p>
<p>如果我們肯定對×作戰，戰而勝之的話，那末我們可以檢查一下二十三個月來抗戰的史實。</p>
<p>×人對我作戰的方法，一般研究以爲過去×人的策略，開始是戰而不勝，繼之是速戰速决，最後是速和速决，這些方法歷史的事實己證明他失敗了。</p>
<p>那末×人在二期作戰的形式究竟怎樣呢？我們司以檢討一下他們進攻有什麼特點。×人向我進攻這一時期已經感到許多困難，首先是戰線從西北至西南，芷面極爲寬廣，×人自從侵入平漢粵澳以來，戰綫延長，他在佔領的缺點與綫之間就則　出許多空隙，由於我們游擊隊的活躍，迫得×人注意防守，因此他兵力很感不够，所以×人今後的進攻就跟第一期不同了，，比方說如果他想把軍事重心放在華南，那末在華北他就很難再有活動，再有他方面的助攻，他己只能組織一個突擊力量，以求戰役的勝利；同時傷主力進攻方向在一定時間內只有一個方向，他進攻南昌，其他方面也就沒有有力的配合，簡括說，這一種行動在戰局上看來只能說他不能作戰略上的部署，只能有一個戰役行動，他是以戰役行動來代替了戰略行動，這是第一個特點。</p>
<p>再說，×人向我進攻，過去攻上海或是攻南京都是把城市當作作戰目標，理由是攻下城市，他可以向國際國內宣傳，可以鼓舞士氣，亦可以給我們一個打擊，可是今天沒有這種形勢。其次他也許以我們的主力作目標，專求會戰來殲滅我們的主力，可是我們進行的是持久戰，在以主力來作戰是决戰的時機沒有到來以前，我們分散兵力避免作戰，因此×人已經很難找到目標，進行决戰。</p>
<p>×人找不到有决定作用的目標是不是不繼續進攻呢？他是要繼續進攻的，但進攻那裏呢？這就產生了第二個特點，只能沿一定的交通線進攻，縮小我們的版圖，控制更長的交通線迫我們主力在國際上意義比較小的邊境，被封鎖在山岳裏，而一方面也就達到他掃蕩後方，建立偽　　造成第二個滿洲國的目力。</p>
<p>有人要問從這　　　×人一貫的沿交通線進攻，爲什麼今日的沿交鑰　　可算爲特點呢？這是因爲目前×人只能組成一個力量，沒有配合力量，而且實際上×人已控制了主要的交通線，如隴海同蒲平綏長江以及若干公路線，而我們則交通線尙未建立，不能很容易地機動，因此×人雖然突擊力量只有一個，但到處還可以找我弱點，以小力取勝，×人可以利用交通線向各方面進攻，這種跳躍的長距離機動性的進攻，可名之謂全面的跳躍作戰。</p>
<p>×人應用這個進攻方式顯然是有利的，第一他可以攻我防禦力薄弱的地區獲得便宜的勝利，雖然這勝利給我們的打擊並不嚴重，但是他可以向國際國內廣大宣傳了。第二，×人利用機械化交通工具可以很迅速的運輸兵力，而我們反處於不利地位，因此他這樣全面的跳躍進攻，可以使我們疲乏，而不能作戰。</p>
<p>保全空間，爭取空間</p>
<p>果如×人採取這一種作戰方法，那麼我們怎樣辦呢？這是必須研究的問題。</p>
<p>我們過去曾經採取「以空間換取時間」，對付×人的積極進攻，確會起過偉大的作用，因爲我們已看出要眞正擊敗×人，必建築在長期抗戰上。第一，把我們的物質基礎從東南轉移到西南，掩護此適當的轉移，以奠定我物質基礎。第二，利用戰爭的刺激與推動，加强我們國內的團結，補助我們過去準備上的缺陷。第三，對付强×，必須提高我們的戰鬥力，爲增强戰鬥技術，也只有在戰爭過程中從戰場上去學習，看看×人怎樣作戰，靠過去所學到的能不能戰勝×人？</p>
<p>所以在戰爭初期，不得不以「空間換取時間」，一方面由於×人的火力比我强，按術比我高，陳地上，火力配備很强，我們不易取勝，但他如果在其行軍中或運動中間，抓住這種機會來一個打擊，便容易取得勝利，最初有計劃地誘×深入，使他聯絡線延長，使我們有更多的機會打擊×人，消耗的目的可以達到，所以空間換取時間，誘×深入，在抗戰初期，是必須採取的方針。</p>
<p>「以空間換取時間」，在第二期抗戰中，是不是準確，兄弟的意思以爲應該加以修改，本間要加以保障是必要的，持久抗戰的力量是在空間，如决戰，力量在那里呢？，如何發動和組織民衆的力量呢？這都聯繋到空閒的保障問題，在某些空間，我們要準備力量，作戰略上反攻的地步，換句話說，必須儘可能的保留未淪陷的空間，但是光是保守空間，這意義還是不够的。</p>
<p>因爲一方面×人在困難的條件下，表現在軍事上的，是全面的跳躍作戰，在政治上就是「以華制華」，他要在佔領地區利用我們物力財力人力。因此，我們必須用盡力量打擊×人，要爭取已淪陷的空間，現在已不能以「空間採取時間」，不僅要保障己有的空間，並還要爭取已淪陷的空間。</p>
<p>長期抗戰不能設想某個時期一到，大軍反攻，經過一二次會戰，一下就追到上海南京，把×人逐過鴨綠江，實際上這是不符合事實的，所以只有拚命爭取空間才能保障第二期作戰的勝利，達到準備反攻力量的目的。</p>
<p>那末在戰術上有什麼方法爭取已淪陷的空間，保留未淪陷的空間呢？這寫有兩個條件，第一，只有用聯鬥來打擊×人的跳躍進攻，使他不能深入，所以在前線需要正規軍打擊×人。第二，我們一定還要用游擊聯不斷地打擊×人後方的聯絡部隊，以牽制×人，而且在政治上使傀儡政權不能建立，在經濟上對×反封鎖，迫得×人無法「以華制華」不能利用我們人力物力，這打擊是有效的，因爲×人受到後方的嚴重打擊，必然增加了他依託後方的前線作戰部隊的困難，過去山西作戰很多這個例子，因爲聯絡綫切斷，他前方部隊接濟斷絕，機械化部隊無法活動，×人克服這因難，只有調前方的兵力囘頭進攻游擊隊，這就是游擊隊帮助前綫正規軍作戰的道理，再由於前方有計劃的向×人突擊，無疑的×人就不能冉向前進攻，這保證了前綫陣地的鞏固，保持了這一地帶的相持狀態，而未淪陷的空間，因此才有保障。另方面在×後方發展游擊戰，建立根據地，保持了×後方的空間，使我力量的生長有把握，有了空間，然後才有力量，所以力量的生長，一部份是在自己的後方，另一部在×後方。</p>
<p>由於我們一方面在戰鬥中消耗×人力量，另一方面，我們的力量繼續增加，這才使×我力量起變化，獲得力量對比的優勢，可以進行有力的反攻，這證明保全未淪陷空間，爭取×後空間的正確，現在不能再「以空間換取時間」，而要爭取時間，也要爭取空間，這才能完成二期抗戰的任務。</p>
<p>一切為着進攻！</p>
<p>當然戰略上一切計劃是要以戰鬥來完成的，因此我們不能不注意戰鬥的實際的運用。根據第一期抗戰的經驗，在二期抗戰中我們一定不能忽視小勝，而要爭取小勝，所以在今日戰術上必須有所改變，雖然我們在戰略上是防禦，可是在戰術上必須採取攻勢，戰術的內容可以說是「一切爲着進攻」。</p>
<p>×人的進攻，是沿着某一條交通綫對某點進攻，這我們在事前可以估計到的。所以第一，戰術上要『襲其所必來』，在×人運動中時，加以打擊取勝，另方面作佯攻，要抓住×人的弱點利用時機，打擊×人，以一師消滅一連也是好的，所以一攻其所必救」亦是爭取進攻獲得勝利必要方法。</p>
<p>第二，防禦必須爲進攻的防禦，以進攻爲目的，採取防禦的手段這樣才好，所以在一條綫上的防禦，是爲了配合出擊取得勝利的。</p>
<p>第三，退却也是重要的，善于作戰的將領，善於進攻，但也善於退却，向退却的目的是爲進攻，進攻不利，干是退却，別方面進攻，這名之謂「轉移」，轉移是一種手段，要達到持久戰消耗的目的，必須進攻，也必須退却，進攻，退却都是爲了消滅×人。</p>
<p>大力打小仗</p>
<p>達到消耗的目的，並非是「硬碰硬」像牛一樣的以角互鬥，這種牛的戰術，我們是不必採用的，我們必須在優勝的條件上，以大力打小仗，爭取小勝，『大力打小仗」是以一軍對一團，一個整師對一營，指探下決心時，必以下列三點爲標準。</p>
<p>第一，是逢大×的打法，那就是用佯攻，搖旗吶喊等虛張聲勢的方法都是佯攻，佯攻可以使×人不知虛實使他處處戒備而分散了力量，這樣就做到牽制×人，可以讓我們主力在有利的情勢底下，擊×取勝。</p>
<p>第二，是遇勁×的打法，我們跟×人對×，如果在數量上雖然是一團對一團，可是實力上×人由於裝配技術等還是比我們强，那時我們也是進襲，只是乘人人在運動中殲滅他們的尾巴或殲滅他們的一部分。</p>
<p>第三，逢小×，那就必須抱定殲滅其全部的决心，毫不客氣地加以殲滅。</p>
<p>總之無論大×勁×小×，我們乃都是向×人進攻，只有戰術上的進攻×人，才能完成戰略上持久消耗的目的。</p>
<p>破壞重於戰鬥</p>
<p>第三個問題是過去我們很少顧到×人後方，上面說過×人機械化部隊完全依賴後方的聯絡綫如果將後方聯絡綫加以破壞，使他的聯絡不靈活，前方的接濟斷絕，這樣就大大地增加了×人的困難，因此我們要發動×後的力量，不論游擊隊正規軍民衆武力從事破壞工作。對×人軍事上的澈底破壤是非常重要的，我們可以提出一個口號呌「破壞重於戰鬥」以大規模的破壞迫得×人改變其裝配，使他爲適合地形不得不放棄重炮坦克，改作輕裝，這樣火力的　度就減少，就可以更有把握地戰勝×人。</p>
<p>總括說在戰鬥上要積極爭取勝利，所以在戰術上必須確定爭取小勝的思想。</p>
<p>用全力求小勝</p>
<p>最後我來說明一下爭取小勝的重要性。</p>
<p>我們的部隊過去很少做到利用時機，以迅速的行動消滅×人，這由於對×作戰自己能在軍事上勝過×人的信心還不够，一部份將領在殲滅×人這一點還缺乏信心，以致造成僅僅是阻×和拖延時間的惰性，常常有前線囘來的將領這樣說「很要得啦，我頂住七個星期」，其實這是非常不够的，我們今天可以以「大力打小仗」創造更光榮的勝利，某一軍某一師對×人一營一連作戰，就應該堅决地實行殲滅戰，×人擊營整連殲滅。抗戰部隊爲了學習殲滅×人的本領也只有在實際的戰鬥過程中間在戰場上對×進行殲滅戰。目前我們企圖以大力殲滅×人，將來我們就有了更旺盛的企圖，不戰則已，一戰則必殲滅×人，因此將來我們的目標可以提高到更大，殲滅×人一個團，同時我們還可以看到某一軍或某一師能殲×人一個營一個連，那末不單是對×人體力上的打擊，還給他一個很大的精神上的打擊，使他從此增長了恐怖心理，不敢再作錐形突擊，另外，殲滅×人取得勝利在國際國內都可以起更好的影響，所以「用全力求小勝」，「以大力打小仗」，整個戰場的作風必須有這樣的一個轉變，今後必須在戰術上應用這些原則求得勝利，才能積小勝爲大勝，爭取最後勝利的到來。</p>
<h3 id="c2">青年怎樣實現戰時任務（上） <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 馮文彬講　西安特約航信</p>
<p>我們所要做的一切工作，要依靠什麼來實現呢？</p>
<p>要依靠組織的力量。</p>
<p>我們的組織力量，比我們第一次代表大會的時候，巳經有了很大的進步。在報吿的第二部份，我們曾經指出這一點。我們的組織工作的技術，也已經進步了許多。我們已經大大克服關門主義和公式主義。我們在組織工作中間，又鍛練了不少新的靑年的幹部，靑年的領袖。這些都是我們能够實現我們的任務的保證。</p>
<p>不過我們也不能忘記我們的缺點，大部份的靑年，尤其是勞動靑年，還停留在組織以外，就是在工作的技術方面，幹部的培養方面，我們的進步也遠遠趕不上客觀形勢的需要，我們曾經指出這些缺點的原因，只是無論如何，我們主觀上努力的不够，是不能掩飾的。</p>
<p>我們的組織任務，自然是爲了實現我們的政治任務，我們今天的政治任務就是要建立中國靑年的統一戰綫，來進行各種抗戰建國的工作。因此我們今天的組織任務就是要去組織全體靑年，努力把千百萬無組織的靑年，驗收到組織中間來。</p>
<p>今天我們工作的重心，是在廣大的戰區和×後方。在這些地方，大部分的城市是在×人手裏，我們所有的地方，大部分都是鄉村。鄉村工作是我們過去工作礎基最薄弱的地方，因此我們的組織工作今後要特別着重由城市轉到鄉村的問題。</p>
<p>要把我們狹小的組織轉變做全體靑年的組織，要把以城市爲中心的工作轉變到以鄉村爲中心，不能　我們主觀的空想，而要首先以我們現實的力量做基礎。我們要在現有的組織基礎上實行轉變。</p>
<p>其次要以我們過去的工作經驗做基礎，我們過去的工作　不是徒然的，我們要虛心的，客觀的，總結我們在組織工作裏的經驗教訓。</p>
<p>我們得到第一個教訓。就是我們着手組織靑年的時候，一定先要深刻的分析各種不同的環境，把握並且適應當時當地的一切的特點，從最具體的工作着手，來建立各種形式的組織，我們的工作才不會碰壁，</p>
<p>第五戰區的靑年救國團和武漢的靑年救國團，雖然名稱相同，宗旨也相近，但是爲了適合環境它不和×，靑年救國團合併，而受第五戰區司令長官直接領導，在保衛徐州的大戰中它發揮了顯著的作用。</p>
<p>陝西有個小學校裏的教員發起組織小學教師聯合會，結果受了阻礙。另外有個小學校的教員們組織了一個教學法研究會，却能够很順利的成功，這個研究會在學校裏實行了戰時教育，此外還做了許多其他的抗日救國的工作，當局都很加贊許。</p>
<p>同樣，××的中國學生組織救國會是不可能的，但是他們組織的賑災會，就能够很順利的發展起來。</p>
<p>我們得到的第二個教訓，就是，我們還要分析不同的靑年，按照他們迫切的需要和固有的傳統，來建立各種不同的組織。</p>
<p>有一個靑年運動比較消沉的城市，一般的靑年團體覆難發展，但是有些靑年組織了一個民衆救亡歌　團，它的中心工作就是唱歌，演戲，開座談會等等，因爲能適合廣大靑年的興趣，所以就發展到一千多人，得到了很大的成績。</p>
<p>又如有一個城市的工廠靑年，對於民族解放先鋒隊靑年救國會一類組織，都不能普遍的歡迎，但是對于組織同鄉會就很熱心，因爲那裏的工廠工人有大半是外省人，所以同鄉的組織就很能適合他們的需要。</p>
<p>陝西有些農村靑年，對於民族解放先鋒隊也不很歡迎，因爲它的意義他們不容易了高解。有的地方有人發起組織一種『冷娃團』他們就很興參加。所謂「冷娃」是陝西方言，專措一種好打不平，不怕事的人。他們很熟悉『冷×』在農村裏光榮的傳統，所以他們很願意加入這種組織，做抗日的『冷×』。</p>
<p>我們得到第三僩教調，就是，我們的組織必須向廣大靑年公開，只有公開的組織，才能成爲廣大靑年的組織，才能求得迅速的發展，有些有歷史有群衆有工作成績的組織，雖然能够在廣大靑年中間公開，地方當局却還沒有能給它們合法的地位，這時就特別需要堅持公開的方計，公開的方針第一可以求得當局的承認，第二可以求得社會的贊許，這兩個條件，都能够保證我們的組織發展的廣泛。</p>
<p>我們得到的第四個教訓，就是，我們的組織必須向惡劣的環境進行必要的鬥爭。現在我們的環境，顯然並不是處處都有利的，有不少地方我們還要受到各種惡勢力無理的障礙。我們爲了顧全大局，固然可以作必要的讓步，但是讓步超過了一定的限度，就反而會貽誤大局，惡勢力反而得進步，這就非要來進行必要的鬥爭不可。有些組織因爲缺少鬥爭的决心和鬥爭的能力，以至受了一些打擊，就支持不住，這樣就不但削弱了靑年運動的力量，也削弱了抗戰的力量，所以我們要發展我們的組織，一定要懂得怎樣把必要的讓步和必要的鬥爭，恰當的配合起來。（未完）</p>

<p>— 君邃</p>
<p>【靑海特約航訊】我們來靑之前，卽承到過靑海的友人相吿，必須往塔爾寺去一次，在那裏可以看看佛教革命家宗喀巴所遺留的眞跡。與我們同來的謝委員慈舟，也竭力設法使我們不虛此，唯西寧離塔爾寺雖僅二十里的路程，但除了汽車，卽須騎牲口或坐　車，往返非常不便。西寧城內僅有馬主席的一輛福特邃車，此外卽無從租借，後承謝委員親自出馬，代向馬主席借用他的西寧唯一的汽車，當荷馬主席慨允，遂定五月四日淸晨七時出發，同行者除章君外，尙有省政府馬視察和馬參議二位。</p>
<p>我們的汽車出了西門，沿途卽見白楊與綠柳，夾道而植，新揷樹苗，尤無從數計，足見當局對於造林的注意。經過的鄉村均有縣立小學，學童負書包正去上學，學生服裝悉稱家之有無，並不强制穿蒼校服，此點也大有廣西精神。快到魯撤鎮時，見有囘教促進會所設的囘教小學，校舍整齊，地點頗廣，與城中的回中同樣實　軍事訓練。魯撤鎮是漢藏兩族互市之所，但不是在審會的時候，貨物既不集中，交易也自然淸淡得很。聞從前會設過洋行，專爲收買藏族的物產，司見從前貿易的盛况了。過了魯撤鎮，就見綠楊　中，崇樓疊閣，殿宇櫛比，那就是佛教聖地塔爾寺了。</p>
<p>我們先駛過八個喇麻塔和小金瓦殿，一直往辦公廳藏名「公本吉哇」的所在，由襄佐更敦大吉導遊全寺，『襄佐一彷彿南方僧寺的住持，不過他們的襄佐分爲管粮，管帳和管庶務的三種，俗名爲大老爺，二老爺，和三老爺爲我們導遊的就是二老爺，他的年紀己有五十八歲，身體魁梧，昔年曾在北平雍和宮住過多時，故說得一口流利的北平話，態度誠懇，一見我們就非常親熱的陪我們玩我們先參觀大經堂，　築參酌中西，極盡富麗堂皇之致，面積極大，聞足容三千喇麻僧參拜念經堂前柱石猶如曲阜大成殿的模　，惜柱子都用紅布包裏，未能見本來面目，堂內的柱子，均爲名貴的西藏毛氈所蔽，拜墊也用高貴的地毯所製，其長　如堂的寬度，唯每一喇麻僧的跪處，自成一圓形圖案，可以代替葡團之用。</p>
<p>再進去就是講經院，建築雄壯內藏漢藏梵三種文字的佛經，藏經的　富爲全國之冠，他們依佛教經律，論三藏分成三個學院，把全寺的喇麻僧經過相當時期的研究經典，並嚴格的考試，然後派到各院，再作各別的極深研究，律學院內又分做醫學和天文二門，今天適值阿嘉呼圖克國口試之期所謂呼圖克圖就是聖者的意思，是喇嘛僧中最高的權威，阿嘉是他的名字，凡與試的喇嘛僧，除一部份在阿嘉座前席地圍坐，受阿嘉面試外，餘則在院前廣場。分爲三大組，每組復分爲若干小組。每一小組，中間一人立衆前發問，餘人圍坐受試。每一問題限時解答，如答案無誤，中立者卽拍手稱是，否則卽以兩手之背相擊，表示所答不符所問，誤答者第一次被罰將唸珠掛入頸部，第二次則以手按其頸部，第三次則以手摩其項以辱之辱聞所試卽爲佛教的因明學也就是論的一部門他們視因明學的程度，以測佛學迭詣的深淺，蓋猶論理學爲治各種學問的門徑，其理實相吻合。我們看到出題發問者的莊嚴沉着的態度，和對答者思考應對的神情，與旁聽者聚精會神靜聆問答的氣度，還有答的對或錯時，出題者當機立斷，做手勢以表示接受或拒絕的姿態，雍容大方，猶老吏斷獄，至於阿嘉的風格，宛如一個淵博的學者，他的講經方法，完全採取自動主義，由聽講者自由發問，然後加以指正。據說喇嘛僧入各院研究以前，須經嚴格的考試，每人得應試三次，至第三次落第時，卽失去進修專科的資格了。又聞爾寺關於律、的經典尙多印度原文，未經譯成藏文，故學律的喇嘛僧，仍以留學印度爲唯一出路。</p>
<p>再進至大金瓦殿，該殿專爲紀念他們的始祖宗喀巴而建，殿頂銅瓦，鍍以黃金，故有大金瓦殿之稱。屋頂飾物，亦爲銅製鍍金，極畫金碧輝皇的能事，殿高三層，殿的中央供宗喀巴像，聞爲純金所鑄，並陳列宗傳教西藏時，寄其母親的指血自畫，，兒時在石口所留的足印，並其他一切遺物。像前佛酥油燈，火光熊熊，聞自建殿以來未嘗滅熄，殿前簷下，用條木鋪地喇嘛僧有遠自蒙古西藏而來，定願在喀巴像前磕他們所謂「等身頭』，就是先把膝顆着地，然後伸手托在頭前，復將頭磕在地上的五體投地的拜法，我們見板上已現出七個印子，卽爲兩手，兩膝，兩脚尖，和一個頭着地磨擦而成的。聞他們磕一萬個頭祗算還一個願，還的願越多磕的頭也越多，而且有的從出了家門數起，一步一叩，叩到塔爾寺的大金瓦殿前爲止，如果還願的人走到中途，所帶體費用罄，不能繼續前進時，則記住停止進行的地點，乞食而返家鄉，以備再積了一筆欵項，將來可再從那裏一步一叩的往塔爾寺而去還願。這種辦法不去說他，然而他們的一往無前，百折不囘的精神着實可敬，倘能移用之求學立業上就非成功不可了。　（未完）</p>

<p>第一是九龍區五十餘校教師之舉行嚴　的國民公約宣誓。第一次聯合起來，在祖國的旗織之下，宣誓絕對擁護蔣委員長的領導，竭力報效國家。希望今後人人互勉，認眞實踐，則不僅今日有助於救亡工作，將來裨益於民族社會的尤不可限量！</p>
<p>第二是九龍區教育節，在參政員張一　先生盬誓領導之下，通過了偉大的提議：向蔣委員長慰勞致敬，召開國民月會，加緊港九教育界的團結等等，這是教育界偉大的表白，這是教育界担負新任務實行新生活的里程碑！</p>
<h3 id="c15">感人的演詞 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>昨天紀念教師節的港區大會席上商務印書館總經理王雲五先生發表了使全體感動的演說。王先生主張今後教育，第一要爲國家養成好國民，勿爲家庭養成好子弟，這一點恰是針對着目前若干×××××教育上的缺點的。我們不僅希望教育界要注意及此，而實明的家長，亦應臨時　地苦口優心地去　　一般父兄。我們還要認淸在這時代，祗營身家性命之私的子弟，一定不是好子弟，而向前能爲一國之好的國民，因爲他能從遠處大處着力，能爲子孫百代計算，所以也一定就是一個眞正的好子弟！</p>
<p>王先生接着又指出今後教育，第一不能僅顧到學生的知識，還要顧到課程以外的生活與修養，第二要　勵舉生自動的積極的學習。這兩點更是當前教育上極重要的指示，希望今後教師與學生及其家長合力指導，不僅應該鼓勵學生參加正當的愛國與社會的運動，並且要　勵學生自求學習與修養的座談會　　會等等，新的時代，需要新的人才，更需要新的教育！願大家努力奮鬥！</p>

<p>【美聯社倫敦六日電】茲據確息、英內閣外交政策委員會、對於莫斯科最近提出之建議、曾加研究、結果認為其中有數項建議不能接受、聞蘇聯要求英法保障愛沙尼亞、芬蘭及拉達維亞三國之完整、該委員會已加反對故英法蘇三國聯盟之訂結、又不能不展緩矣、但外間謠傳三國聯盟之談判行將决裂、則已遭官方之否認、英政府一發言人又稱、英政府不願藐視波羅的海各國之願望、或不經其同意而貿然作戰、以保護各該國之獨立云、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦五日電】今日下議院開會時、有詢問首相張伯倫氏將考慮親赴莫斯科作正式訪問否、張氏答稱、在目前之階段下、彼認爲上述建議、未見能有何效用、又有問首相是否感覺個人訪蘇一舉、足以澄消一英蘇雙方之障碍及不如意現象」張氏未予置答、</p>

<p>據此間蘇聯人士所知、該國覆文內容、係將英法兩國草案逐條檢討、或則逕予接受、或則加以修正、修正中之最重要者共有三條、計（一）英法草案曾經提及國聯會盟約精神字樣、俾爲盟約與英法蘇三國互助協定樹立、「蘇聯茲建議修正條文如下」、英法蘇三國因欲發揚國聯盟約各項原則、並依照盟約精神、爰相訂約、果爾、則盟約第十六條「卽關於制裁侵略國之條欵、其所載制裁辦法、應於國聯會行政院全體一致通過之後、始可實施」、卽可不必更事援引、（二）英法草案主張各簽字國互相諮詢、此在蘇聯、以爲在並無戰爭危機之時、不妨保持諮詢辦法、設暹發生此種危機、則應立即有所行動、並應在事前規定方式、（三）英法兩國草案、主張各國應對各簽字國互相保障、苟有簽字國之一、遭受侵略、而向簽字國之一請援、應卽予以援助、此在蘇聯、則以爲芬蘭、拉達維亞、愛沙尼亞三國亦應予以保障、並在英法蘇三國協定中載明各該國之國名、此間消息靈通人士頃宣稱、一二兩點、英國各閣昌願設法予以解决、但以第三點而論、波羅的海沿岸各國、各不願接受英法蘇三國之保障、此種態度、未便置之不顧、但同時對于歐洲此一隅之現行狀態、又須設法維持、兼籌並顧、困難之至、大抵英國將先由外交途徑、與蘇聯進行談話、以冀覓獲新頴方式、務求各關係國、可在原則上、予以採取、然後再向蘇聯正式提出新建議云、</p>

的各個戰場、應取完全的守勢、但同時、派遣海軍艦隊到地中海以及相當的陸空軍到非洲、這一計劃雖未實現、然而德、意目前之非無意對付蘇聯、是非常明顯的、　　因了這些現象、所以在目前的英國、到處充滿了對德、蘇默契的担心、隨手舉兩個例子在這裏、第一件、是最近晤士報上出現一個警吿、這個警吿、是它駐羅馬記者發出來的、他提醒英國人士們叫他們一刻不要忘記希特勒在一九三〇年所說過的話、那是、他要「把印度給予蘇聯、把非洲分給意大利」、第二件、在英國目前有一部書中的一句話、受到了許多人的談論和注意、書是一個澳國人杜勒克爾博士的近著、書名曰The　End　of　Economic　Men，而那句名言呢、却是、「無論從那一個角度看、蘇德間的接近、幾乎是不可免的、除非在最近期內、有一個大規模的戰爭、或者可以阻止它、——所謂最近期間也者、一九四〇年、是最後的期間了、」這句名言的寫下來、是遠在英國這次改變政策以前、然而、還是很可注意的、　　然而、這一節所述、從英、法的立場看起來、祗可以說是暗影、此外、最近也還轉的光明面、光明面是什麼呢、是：　　（未完）

<p>自由談孤島行  莊瑞源　　河內的末班快車到達海防的時候，已經是夜十裏二點鐘了。我猶在那堆積如小山丘的行李上辨認『上海行』，全是用粉筆寫的字；於是感覺一點喜悅，便這樣寫下來了。　　三天前，我搭火車動身的時候，一個朋友握着我的手，問：　　「到底爲什麽你要到上海去」？　　「我不知道」。我是爲着一件私事，可是我想這不能成爲說服朋友的理由；而且事實上，也不知道除了這簡單的理由外到底爲的是什麽。　　「我倒知道了。老實說，我也想囘去』。他把我的手握得更緊。　　『那麼，一道走好嗎』？我迷茫地笑了起來。這樣，連自己都覺得，我是被羨慕着。被羨慕着能在海防車站上爲那些粉筆寫的字感覺到一點喜悅。雖然輾轉於重舟重車之間，媒灰的世界裏，多　是一次遙遠而艱辛的旅程；然而路依然直通到上海。一切的路都可通到羅馬去的。　　現在，艱辛而遙遠的旅程開始了，我只說是爲了兩年的懷念，懷念上海像一個久別的朋友。應該說這是多麽可笑的事，從動身的那一天起，爲着設明自己懷念這個久別的朋友，盡我的所有那麼地懷念着她，我重新整理起兩年前的語言知識了。　　跳上火車，我對着月台上的送行者說：『囘去吧！』用兩年前懂得的上海話，以後我從不放鬆每一個說話的機會，只要這個機會一輪到我的身上，便不假思索地應用着彷彿是在另一個時代裏的上海話；六七年前我說着的，而在這兩年來是　棄了的方言。當我一個人偶然　錯了一個安南人的脚的時候，我連聲說着抱歉的話，他却狠狠地睜了我一眼。　　我離開一個依戀的地方動身到一個懷念的地方去，這旅途不是一天甚至十天可以定盡的。於是火車第一次把我拋下來，拋到一個寂寞的小城中，車站又把我指點給一家不遠的旅館，夜裏，因爲黑暗中的山路是危險的，火車停息了火，休息在月台上，但是這又不是我要到的地方，我却被迫在這裏停留下來了，在依戀着和懷念着的兩個地方之間停留下來了，悵惘是缺乏形容的言語，我說不出我是怎樣地在這家旅館留下了一夜的名字。　　第二天，火車又開行了車上的寂寞仍是難耐的。我用上海話在乘客之中尋到了一個同行者，瘦小而且很矮，牙齒爲香烟薰黃了，說話的時候，　睛　看着人，他的話便像他的唾沫那麽多而瑣碎，一絲絲地噴出來，他是一個紙烟商人，在純白的上海話裏邊不時地夾進商場意味的寗波話，就好像對於任何那一個人，他無時不在進行着一批交易似地。　　『你看，遍山遍野全是香蕉、爲什麽不知道採來賣啊！』　　火車　簛着到了安沛車姑的時候，赤脚的安南女人擁進車門，籃子裝着野地裏採來的香蕉和芭蕉；當安南女人拿香蕉在他的眼前搬來搬去的時候，却怨了：這是野生的香蕉呢。『是的，的越換得太貴了，一元八角只換到一塊錢。』　　但是我只低低地笑着，　管在過去，首多麽疾厭惡這樣的人、如今我實在沒有能力背過臉去避開這　的人了，我懷念上海。兩年不曾再說的話，現在又出現在我的嘴上而這樣的人正是我現在所需要的。　　我說明了我是怎搽迫切想去一看上海之後。問它爲什麽要從重慶囘到上海去。　　『是因爲重慶的轟炸嗎？』　　『不，不轟炸我也得囘去。我那能可以不囘去呢？」　　接着他開始噴濺更多的唾沫，而他的結論是說上海仍然很重要。一個香烟廠因爲戰事的關係從上海　到香港和漢口，但還有一部份留在上海。他們的香煙公司便是包辦了這家工廠的經售權的，這次旅行的主要任務當然是爲內地的香煙吸食者作呼籲了。然而「老實說，抗戰以後，香煙還未曾在廠裏漲過一分錢的價」。上海仍然很重要，因爲只有上海的香煙廠方未曾提高出品的價格。另外他要把香港的家眷送囘上海去，再從上海把他的兄弟帶囘重慶去。　　當然爲這點事情也許不致使他有這樣花錢的旅行。他有着更多的的事務。總之，上海仍然很重要，是他的結論。　　問題的提出往往是適應着相反的一面，他實在太興奮了，我抓了一個問題出來。打算聽他感到一點掃興。於是說了。　　『上海很靠不住，不要把家眷送到敵人那裏去啊』　　『那裏的話！不會得。上海一生一世都是我們的』。　　他的唾沫是一絲絲地噴出來，眼睛盡在我的身上打着轉，說下去了。上海是我們的地方，我們租給洋人、再轉租給我們。二房東和房客全住在一座房子裏：想闖進來，佔領了是多麽不容易的事呵！一……我失敗了。　　雖說我不儘然喜歡他的這　說法，這個比喻却使我感到興趣，一個商人，被一兩年來的炮火打得焦頭爛額，他的眼睛看見的是錢，戰爭使他虧損的也是錢。他跑到重慶，他的結論說上海仍然是很重要，而且一生一世都是我們的。　　無論如何，上海還走得通，因爲那是我們的地方，這是爲什麽看見了那用粉筆寫着的字，我感覺到一點喜悅，而且這樣寫下來。五分鐘　（二）  羅烽　　賀錚的表面雖然十分安詳；可是他的內心正像鐐環那機亢奮地響着，而且他感覺到心的　動音響，使他　不見鐐環的丁當　。　　怎樣死呢？他對於這個新奇的謎，浪費了好多寶貴的時光去猜測它，他首先猜到他們不會用槍，其次……可以使他致死的方法，那就多得不可想像了、究竟用那種方法，他還不能預先斷定。他想：五分鐘以後什麼全可明白了，什麽也全完結了！　　他的手鏢已被敵兵沒收了去。現在他沒有更準確的時計能以計算那五分鐘時間的長短，按照平常的試驗，每七十下脈搏等於一分鐘，那末大約三百五十下左右，便接近那個時候，於是他一邊徜徉的向前走，一邊將手鏢按在另一隻手的手腕上，但他還沒有按到脈搏的所在，就像受　了似的分開兩手，他覺得這種舉動，實在是愚蠢，無聊。　　脚步遲緩地延續着。脚的每一個鐵環，都打開了鏗鏘的喉嚨，唱着極其單調的進行曲　這荒山的四郊，也同時遙遙地呼應着……　　他不知走走多久，不過他知道一定還沒有超過五分鐘，不然的話，他就要立刻倒斃　荒山上。　　他開始詛咒這個沒有月光的夜，這夜，除了一層接一層的黑暗而外，什麼全看不見。至于將來，不，也許就在目前，那個可怕的時候來到，敵人使用什麼樣方法消滅他的生命，也是難以看見的，賀錚對于這樣的死，認爲是畢生的最大一件憾事。　　時間慢得像是向後倒退下來，在很早以前賀錚就總是覺得每一呼吸的間斷，都有永遠停止呼吸的機會，但現在那個機會，却又像是永遠不能實現了。　　正當賀錚的神志非常迷憫的時候有一隻組暴的大手，忽然從他的背後一推於是他的全身就　斜着往前踉蹌好幾步，末了，被一種碩大而堅硬的東西絆倒了，他的胸部掛在那東西上邊，而頭部倒懸着。在十幾秒鐘以內，他沒有變動另外的姿勢，他沉默地伏在那廢，等待接受不可知的死飛，這時候，他的聽覺發現了獸類的鼻息聲，而且那聲昔就近在身邊，他知道自己是被投入猛獸　里了、於是他本能地站立起來，向着那鼻息聲獰笑了笑。兩名看守兵在外面　　着。　　（未完）遠離  于塞夫　　母親從窗子裏探出頭來，　說：　　「要當心身體啊！」　　我點了下頭，踏着十二月的陰雲的影子，匆匆地走開了。　　年經的弟弟在門口注視住我，我們是默默地分開的，我囘過頭去，再也望不見什麼是家的門　，我望見的祗是淡黃的建築物，紅的屋頂。藍天上像花朶般地開放着活躍的白雲。　　昨夜，在朋友的屋子的門外，那　濁的呼喝聲音，那手銬聲那黑色的沒有照會的汽車……這些給了我多大的震動；早上，我知道他失蹤了，而今，我……　　我不得不開始流亡。　　汽笛吼了。水手解掉了船纜，碼頭工人紛紛地從船中躍到碼頭上，他們擁擠，他們呌喊，他們好像在觀望什麽。烟突裏冒出了淡淡的烟。汽笛吼了！　　趕緊提着兩只箱篋，從人堆裏擠進去，船已經離開了碼頭有一尺模樣，跳進船艙又那麼忽忙地奔到船申板上，爲的是再想看看父親和妹妹們的臉孔……　　父親　着肩，把整個的蒼老的臉孔朝着我，接着，他除去呢相，灰白的頭髮好像在代替他的痛心的祝語。妹妹們沈下了臉，不再對我獃笑了。　　我摸出手絹來，向他們揮動，並且還勉强浮起了笑。父親揮着呢帽……　　將向他們說些什麽呢？　　這種嘈難的聲音，而且汽笛吼了又吼，機器，水浪，風，都阻礙着我的呼喊。　　將向他們呼喊些什麽呢　　終於，人小，景小，一切成了白茫茫的霧。從此，我離開了他們，當輪船駛出吳淞口時，我見到太陽在暮色中悽凉地睜着血腥的嘴……那面旗是插在屋上。　　『有那麼一天的……』　　於是，在我的腦際飄浮起了太陽旗的軍艦都被炸沉在海裏的圖面。　　我坐在船艙裏，面對着汹湧的深綠色的海。天色漸潮深邊了，海面廣闊得使人恐怖起來，風，自由地放浪地疾奔在這動盪的原野、它嘯着，吞沒了從煙突裏出來的煙。　　燈亮了，不久，忽然汽笛又吼了。　　『爲什麽？』　　『爲什麽？』　　搭船的發覺船位了，大家都睜大了眼睛，向不好的事情方面想去。　『檢査來了……』　　船艙裏都雜亂起來。我打開箱篋，把所帶的自己的二冊筆記送給了海。我難受地，復蓋下箱子。　　不久，五六個一羣的×兵有二三羣在我們之間亂翻，他們不說話，船艙裏被他們帶來了死寂。……第二天，我才知道這次的搜索，被捕了九個中國人。　　啓事五月份稿費，業已結出，惠稿諸君，請具條蓋章，自本月六日起至二十日止，每日上午九時至十二時，下午二時至五時（星期日除外）向砵甸乍街二號本館會計處領取爲荷。　自由談編輯部啓兄弟之間  曾兆筠　　自從×人的騎兵駐紥莒縣以後，市面便好像墓場一樣死寂，一大羣被　國　下的老百姓，眼睛都濕潤潤的，非常痛楚。老人們多數搖頭浩嘆，世道淪亡，人心不古，所以才有此慘酷的報　；少年呢？他們都不願做順民，當奴隸　他們亮閃閃的曈孔，放射出不平凡的光芒，狠狠地向遠處望，像在等待什麽。　　離市場不遠的一間未被砲火轟塌的平房，住著兩兄弟，三十二歲的大張；二十七歲的小張，兩人的面孔，生得非常相似、白白的臉，細長的眉，差不多連脚趾甲也沒有兩樣，假若不是大張左耳多一個砂金打成一兩半重耳環的話，就是他倆底在棺木裏睡覺的母親，也恐怕很難分辦得出哩。說到大張這個人眞是一個少年道學，長年穿着束緊褲脚的馬褲，胸前的小袋揷上一枝小楷筆，在大學已讀了七年，還得不到一個學士，他的舉動和他的言語一樣遲緩，慢吞吞的唯恐其錯，不過他却有一點可取，就是『仁讓可風』四個大字，凡事均肯退一步着想，而且富有犧牲精神，能够成全人家，犧牲自己，說到小張呢，他和大張僅有　一個相同點，就是『都肯犧牲』。其他的一切便判若成壞了，小張思想很淸新而又能幹，到處都擺出『領袖』的姿態，在學校裏，他打過校長，捆過敎員，在社會裏，他一直向惡勢力挑戰着。一他倆是一對非常要好的兄弟，從來不鬥一句嘴，但自莒縣變成淪陷區，敵人的『英勇』（？）姿態在莒縣耀武揚威的時候，小張變了　　吃飯，小張時常故意打破碗子，說這樣菜不好，說那樣菜太壞，粗劣的飯更是不能下咽，他實在不能再住下去，他要分家，他又說父親臨死時曾說過把一半田產分給他，要大張馬上淸算起來，各定各路，大張看見心愛的弟弟忽然變了另一個人，覺得很奇怪，但他承認什麽事都會可能的也沒有細想弟弟『變』的原因，他側着耳朵細細聽小張獅子般的吼聲，直至小張怒氣平息以後，他纔慢吞吞的說：『老四，爲什麽要說分家呢？你要多少拿多少好了。你叫我一怎樣搶得你……當父親臨死的時候——』他說到這裏淚點從鼻尖滾到古式鴨脚上。　　三月十五那晚，是月亮圓圓的日子，大地舖滿了一層銀色的光，使人眞有『風月依然』之感，小張披着一件大衣，踏著月色囘來，笑嘻嘻來迎著的就是大張。　　『老四，你看這樣好的月色，正是兄弟手足團聚的徵兆，我們來乾一杯吧。』　　「哥哥，」小張的聲昔帶點顫動，似乎動了感情，「現在不是我們團圓吃酒的時候，我勸你還是立刻和我分家，不然于你很不利的！　工　　「不然于你很不利的！」大張一晚沒睡，慢吞吞地想著弟弟的話，到東方發白，他似乎恍然大悟了。　　「老四一定去幹什麽不軌行爲，他恐怕速累我，所以——所以就要「分家」了！」大張自己對自己說，他想找小張，但是尋遍縣城，也找不到小張的踪跡。　　十八晚，浮雲蓋了月光，我們的淤擊隊發動了，槍口的火光，映得滿天通紅，疏疏的星星很像醉漢的面，他們先進攻馬房，打死了所有的馬，敵人的騎兵，旣沒有了馬、戰門力消失大半，一个个都變成製屍灰的材料，等到援軍開到，游擊隊已是無彭無蹤　。　　廣場上，縛著一個三十多歲的人，白白的臉；細長的眉，左耳掛著「隻兩多重的耳環，胸前的小袋還揷著那枝小楷筆，據說，這就是游擊隊的領袖，身名叫做「小張·小張！」的哩。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Current War Situation, Strategy, and Tactics: "Seek Small Victories with Full Strength, Fight Small Battles with Great Force" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Minzhi, Guilin Air Mail, May 31st) A certain military expert recently gave a speech in Guilin on the current situation of the war of resistance, strategy, and tactics, which has been highly valued by all parties. We hereby record the full text as follows: (Editor's note: Some Hong Kong newspapers have published a part of it. To facilitate readers to see the whole picture, we specially publish the full text.)</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance entered its second phase, the × [Japanese] have changed their offensive strategy. Although our strategic approach is still to deal with them with persistence, the method of war guidance is also different from the first phase.</p>
<p>The first question we should discuss today is how to achieve the goal of a protracted war, which at present is how to exhaust the strength of the × [Japanese] and increase our own strength.</p>
<p>To Win by Delay or to Win by Fighting!</p>
<p>On this issue, some people share the belief that a protracted war will lead to victory, but they see persistence as delay, believing that as long as the delay is long enough, the × [Japanese] will inevitably collapse on their own. Therefore, decisive battles with the main force need to be avoided. In order to delay, they still adopt the past method of exchanging space for time, that is, continuous retreat. It doesn't matter if we retreat to a more remote border. Once the × [Japanese] collapse, we can return to Nanjing with our entire army. In fact, if we build our strategy on this method of delay, it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Because the × [Japanese] are currently taking advantage of this psychology, attacking this weakness: Since Wang Jingwei defected, the × [Japanese] offensive has become more subtle, also because Wang Jingwei understands China's internal affairs more clearly than the × [Japanese], so it is said that the current × [Japanese] offensive is to expand into our weak points, taking advantage of the gaps. He takes the divisions between the central government and local authorities, between local authorities, between armies, and between parties as his targets of attack. Therefore, if we still advocate winning by delay, the result will inevitably be our passive preparation in the rear, passive ambushes in the front to annihilate the × [Japanese], and passive efforts to fight the × [Japanese] in the rear. In short, all preparations will be passive, so a strategic counter-offensive in the future will not be possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, our second phase of operations against the × [Japanese] must be to win by fighting, not to win by delay, but to actively gain victories in battle. Because to win by fighting, we must make the strength of the whole country move towards a difficult future, so as not to be undermined by this passivity, so that the × [Japanese] have the possibility to use their strength and use their claws to destroy us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must use attrition warfare to strive for victory as much as possible. Only by actively seeking victory can we avoid being passive about the future of the war of resistance, have confidence in the design of our work, and become more active.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Leaping Warfare</p>
<p>If we affirm that we will fight and win against the × [Japanese], then we can examine the historical facts of the war of resistance over the past twenty-three months.</p>
<p>The method of warfare the × [Japanese] use against us is generally believed by researchers to have been one of failing to win in battle at the beginning, followed by a quick fight to a quick resolution, and finally a quick peace to a quick resolution. Historical facts have proven that these methods have failed.</p>
<p>So, what is the form of the × [Japanese]'s second phase of operations? We can examine what are the characteristics of their offensive. In this period of the × [Japanese] offensive against us, they have felt many difficulties. First of all, the battle line from the northwest to the southwest is extremely wide. Since the × [Japanese] invaded Pinghan and Yueao, the battle line has been extended, and many gaps have appeared between the occupied points and lines. Due to the activity of our guerrillas, the × [Japanese] have been forced to pay attention to defense, so their troop strength is very insufficient. Therefore, the × [Japanese]'s offensive in the future will be different from the first phase. For example, if he wants to put his military focus in South China, then it will be difficult for him to have any activities in North China, let alone any auxiliary attacks. He can only organize a striking force to seek a strategic victory; at the same time, the main attack direction is only in one direction within a certain period of time. When he attacked Nanchang, other aspects did not have effective coordination. In short, this kind of action can only be said that he cannot make strategic deployments from the perspective of the war situation, and can only have a strategic action. He is replacing strategic actions with strategic actions. This is the first feature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the × [Japanese] attacked us in the past, whether it was attacking Shanghai or Nanjing, they regarded the city as the target of the battle. The reason was that by taking the city, he could propagandize to the international community and at home, boost morale, and also give us a blow. But today there is no such situation. Secondly, perhaps he takes our main force as the target, seeking a decisive battle to annihilate our main force, but we are conducting a protracted war. Before the timing of the decisive battle with the main force has arrived, we disperse our forces to avoid combat. Therefore, it has become very difficult for the × [Japanese] to find a target to conduct a decisive battle.</p>
<p>If the × [Japanese] cannot find a decisive target, will they not continue to attack? He will continue to attack, but where will he attack? This produces the second characteristic, he can only attack along a certain line of communication, reduce our territory, and control longer lines of communication, forcing our main force to be blockaded in the mountains on the border with less international significance, and on the one hand, he will also achieve his goal of sweeping the rear and establishing a puppet government to create a second Manchuria.</p>
<p>Some people want to ask, since the × [Japanese] have consistently attacked along the lines of communication, why can today's attack along the key points be regarded as a characteristic? This is because at present, the × [Japanese] can only form one force, without a coordinating force, and in fact, the × [Japanese] have already controlled the main lines of communication, such as Longhai, Tongpu, Pingsui, the Yangtze River, and some highway lines, while our lines of communication have not yet been established and cannot be easily mobilized. Therefore, although the × [Japanese] only have one striking force, they can still find our weaknesses everywhere and win small victories with small forces. The × [Japanese] can use the lines of communication to attack in all directions. This kind of leaping long-distance mobile offensive can be called a comprehensive leaping warfare.</p>
<p>The application of this offensive method is obviously beneficial to the × [Japanese]. First, he can attack our weakly defended areas and gain cheap victories. Although this victory does not give us a serious blow, he can widely publicize it to the international community and at home. Second, the × [Japanese] can use mechanized transportation to quickly transport troops, while we are at a disadvantage. Therefore, this comprehensive leaping offensive can make us exhausted and unable to fight.</p>
<p>Preserving Space, Seizing Space</p>
<p>If the × [Japanese] adopt this method of warfare, then what should we do? This is a question that must be studied.</p>
<p>In the past, we adopted "exchanging space for time" to deal with the × [Japanese]'s active offensive, which did play a great role, because we have seen that to truly defeat the × [Japanese], it must be built on a long-term war of resistance. First, to transfer our material base from the southeast to the southwest, and to cover this proper transfer, in order to lay the foundation for our material base. Second, to use the stimulation and promotion of war to strengthen our domestic unity and supplement our past shortcomings in preparation. Third, to deal with the strong × [Japanese], we must improve our combat effectiveness. In order to enhance combat technology, we can only learn from the battlefield in the process of war, see how the × [Japanese] fight, and see if what we have learned in the past can defeat the × [Japanese]?</p>
<p>Therefore, in the early stages of the war, we had to "exchange space for time," partly because the × [Japanese]'s firepower was stronger than ours, and their tactics were better than ours. On the plains, the firepower was very strong, and it was not easy for us to win. But if he seized this opportunity during his march or movement to strike a blow, it would be easy to achieve victory. Initially, we planned to lure the × [Japanese] deep into our territory, extending his lines of communication, so that we would have more opportunities to strike the × [Japanese] and achieve the goal of attrition. Therefore, exchanging space for time and luring the × [Japanese] deep into our territory was a policy that had to be adopted in the early stages of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Is "exchanging space for time" accurate in the second phase of the war of resistance? My brother's opinion is that it should be modified. It is necessary to protect the space. The strength of the protracted war of resistance lies in the space. If there is a decisive battle, where is the strength? How to mobilize and organize the power of the masses? These are all linked to the issue of space protection. In some spaces, we must prepare our strength for a strategic counter-offensive. In other words, we must preserve as much un-occupied space as possible, but just preserving space is not enough.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand, the × [Japanese], under difficult conditions, express their military efforts in the form of a comprehensive leaping war, and in politics, it is "using Chinese to control Chinese." He wants to use our material resources, financial resources, and human resources in the occupied areas. Therefore, we must use all our strength to strike the × [Japanese] and strive to regain the occupied space. Now we can no longer "exchange space for time," but must not only protect the space we already have, but also strive to regain the occupied space.</p>
<p>A long-term war of resistance cannot imagine that when a certain period arrives, the large army will launch a counter-offensive, and after one or two decisive battles, it will immediately chase back to Shanghai and Nanjing, driving the × [Japanese] across the Yalu River. In fact, this is not in accordance with the facts. Therefore, only by desperately striving for space can we guarantee the victory of the second phase of the war and achieve the goal of preparing for a counter-offensive force.</p>
<p>Then, what tactical methods are there to strive for occupied space and retain un-occupied space? This has two conditions. First, we can only use joint battles to strike the × [Japanese]'s leaping offensive to prevent him from penetrating deep into our territory. Therefore, we need regular troops on the front line to strike the × [Japanese]. Second, we must also use guerrilla warfare to continuously strike the × [Japanese]'s rear communication units to contain the × [Japanese], and politically prevent the establishment of puppet regimes, and economically impose a counter-blockade on the × [Japanese], forcing the × [Japanese] to be unable to "use Chinese to control Chinese" and unable to use our manpower and resources. This strike is effective, because the × [Japanese] are severely attacked in the rear, which will inevitably increase the difficulties for the front-line combat troops relying on the rear. There were many examples of this in the past in the Shanxi campaign. Because the communication lines were cut off, the supplies to his front-line troops were cut off, and the mechanized troops could not move. To overcome this difficulty, the × [Japanese] could only turn back the front-line troops to attack the guerrillas. This is the reason why the guerrillas help the regular troops on the front line to fight. Furthermore, due to the planned attacks on the × [Japanese] on the front line, the × [Japanese] will undoubtedly not be able to advance any further, which guarantees the consolidation of the front-line positions and maintains the stalemate in this area, and the un-occupied space is therefore guaranteed. On the other hand, developing guerrilla warfare in the × [Japanese] rear and establishing bases preserves the space in the × [Japanese] rear, so that we can be sure of the growth of our strength. With space, then we have strength, so the growth of strength is partly in our own rear and partly in the × [Japanese] rear.</p>
<p>Because we consume the strength of the × [Japanese] in battle on the one hand, and our strength continues to increase on the other hand, this is what makes the strength of the × [Japanese] and us change, and we gain an advantage in the balance of power, so we can launch a powerful counter-offensive. This proves that preserving the un-occupied space and striving for the space in the × [Japanese] rear is correct. Now we can no longer "exchange space for time," but we must strive for time and also strive for space, so that we can complete the task of the second phase of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Everything for the Sake of Offense!</p>
<p>Of course, all strategic plans must be completed by combat. Therefore, we cannot ignore the actual application of combat. Based on the experience of the first phase of the war of resistance, we must not ignore small victories in the second phase of the war of resistance, but strive for small victories. Therefore, there must be some changes in tactics today. Although we are on the defensive strategically, we must adopt an offensive posture tactically. The content of tactics can be said to be "everything for the sake of offense."</p>
<p>The × [Japanese] offensive is to attack a certain point along a certain line of communication, which we can estimate in advance. Therefore, first, tactically, we must "attack what he must come to," and strike and win when the × [Japanese] are in motion. On the other hand, make a feigned attack, seize the × [Japanese]'s weaknesses and take advantage of the opportunity to strike the × [Japanese]. It is good to have a division destroy a company. Therefore, "attacking what he must save" is also a necessary method to strive for offensive victory.</p>
<p>Second, defense must be defense for offense, with offense as the purpose, and defensive measures are taken. So, defense on a line is to coordinate with attacks to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Third, retreat is also important. A general who is good at fighting is good at attacking, but also good at retreating. The purpose of retreating is to attack. If the attack is unfavorable, then retreat and attack in other directions. This is called "transfer." Transfer is a means. To achieve the purpose of protracted attrition, we must attack and we must retreat. Attacking and retreating are all to eliminate the × [Japanese].</p>
<p>Fight Small Battles with Great Force</p>
<p>Achieving the goal of attrition is not "head-to-head," like bulls fighting each other with their horns. We do not need to adopt this kind of bull-like tactics. We must fight small battles with great force under superior conditions and strive for small victories. "Fighting small battles with great force" is using an army against a regiment, or a full division against a battalion. When deciding on the exploration, the following three points must be taken as the standard.</p>
<p>First, it is the method of dealing with big × [Japanese], that is, using feigned attacks, waving flags, shouting and other methods of making a false show of strength are all feigned attacks. Feigned attacks can make the × [Japanese] not know the truth and keep them on guard everywhere, thus dispersing their strength. This can contain the × [Japanese] and allow our main force to strike and win against the × [Japanese] under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Second, it is the method of dealing with strong × [Japanese]. When we are facing the × [Japanese], even if it is a regiment against a regiment in terms of numbers, the × [Japanese] are still stronger than us in terms of equipment technology, etc. At that time, we will also attack, but only take advantage of the opportunity to annihilate their tails or annihilate a part of them when they are in motion.</p>
<p>Third, when encountering small × [Japanese], we must be determined to annihilate all of them and annihilate them without hesitation.</p>
<p>In short, whether it is big × [Japanese], strong × [Japanese], or small × [Japanese], we are all attacking the × [Japanese]. Only by tactically attacking the × [Japanese] can we complete the strategic goal of protracted attrition.</p>
<p>Destruction is More Important than Combat</p>
<p>The third problem is that in the past we rarely paid attention to the × [Japanese] rear. As mentioned above, the × [Japanese] mechanized troops completely rely on the rear communication lines. If the rear communication lines are destroyed, making his communication inflexible and cutting off supplies to the front, this will greatly increase the difficulties for the × [Japanese]. Therefore, we must mobilize the strength in the × [Japanese] rear, whether it is the guerrillas, the regular army, or the masses, to engage in destructive work. Thorough destruction of the × [Japanese] militarily is very important. We can put forward a slogan called "destruction is more important than combat" to force the × [Japanese] to change his equipment on a large scale, so that he has to abandon heavy artillery and tanks to adapt to the terrain, and switch to light equipment. In this way, the intensity of the firepower will be reduced, and we can be more confident of defeating the × [Japanese].</p>
<p>In summary, we must actively strive for victory in combat. Therefore, tactically, we must establish the idea of striving for small victories.</p>
<p>Seek Small Victories with Full Strength</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to explain the importance of striving for small victories.</p>
<p>In the past, our troops rarely made use of opportunities to eliminate the × [Japanese] with rapid action. This is because we do not have enough confidence in our ability to militarily overcome the × [Japanese] in combat. Some generals still lack confidence in annihilating the × [Japanese], which has led to the inertia of merely blocking the × [Japanese] and delaying time. Generals returning from the front often say, "It's very good that I held out for seven weeks," but in fact, this is far from enough. Today, we can create more glorious victories by "fighting small battles with great force." If an army or a division is fighting against a battalion or a company of the × [Japanese], it should resolutely implement annihilation warfare, and the × [Japanese] will annihilate the entire battalion and company. In order to learn the ability to annihilate the × [Japanese], the anti-Japanese troops can only conduct annihilation warfare against the × [Japanese] on the battlefield in the actual combat process. At present, we are trying to annihilate the × [Japanese] with great force. In the future, we will have more vigorous attempts. We will not fight unless we are sure of annihilating the × [Japanese]. Therefore, in the future, our goal can be raised to a greater level, annihilating a regiment of the × [Japanese]. At the same time, we can also see that an army or a division can annihilate a battalion or a company of the × [Japanese]. That is not only a physical blow to the × [Japanese], but also a great spiritual blow to him, making him grow a sense of terror from then on and dare not make cone-shaped突擊 [blunt attack]. In addition, annihilating the × [Japanese] and achieving victory can have a better impact internationally and domestically. Therefore, "seeking small victories with full strength" and "fighting small battles with great force" must be the change in the style of the entire battlefield. In the future, these principles must be applied tactically to seek victory, so that we can accumulate small victories into big victories and strive for the arrival of the final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e2">How Young People Can Fulfill Wartime Missions (Part 1) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Speech by Feng Wenbin, Special Air Mail from Xi'an</p>
<p>What do we rely on to achieve all the work we want to do?</p>
<p>We must rely on the power of organization.</p>
<p>Our organizational strength is much greater than it was at the time of our first representative congress. In the second part of the report, we pointed out this point. Our organizational work techniques have also improved a lot. We have greatly overcome closed-doorism and formalism. In the process of organizational work, we have also trained many new young cadres and young leaders. These are all guarantees that we can fulfill our missions.</p>
<p>However, we must not forget our shortcomings. Most of the young people, especially the working young people, are still outside the organization. Even in terms of work techniques and cadre training, our progress is far behind the needs of the objective situation. We have pointed out the reasons for these shortcomings, but in any case, our insufficient subjective efforts cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>Our organizational mission is naturally to realize our political mission. Our political mission today is to establish a united front of Chinese youth to carry out various tasks of resisting Japan and building the country. Therefore, our organizational mission today is to organize all young people and strive to absorb millions of unorganized young people into the organization.</p>
<p>Today, the focus of our work is in the vast war zones and the × [Japanese]-occupied rear. In these places, most of the cities are in the hands of the × [Japanese], and most of the places we have are rural areas. Rural work is the place where our past work foundation is the weakest. Therefore, our organizational work in the future must especially focus on the issue of shifting from the city to the countryside.</p>
<p>To transform our narrow organization into an organization for all young people, and to transform the work centered on the city to being centered on the countryside, we cannot rely on our subjective fantasies, but must first base it on our real strength. We must implement the transformation on the basis of our existing organization.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must base it on our past work experience. Our past work has not been in vain. We must humbly and objectively summarize our experiences and lessons in organizational work.</p>
<p>We have learned the first lesson. That is, when we start to organize young people, we must first deeply analyze the various different environments, grasp and adapt to all the characteristics of the time and place, and start with the most concrete work to establish various forms of organization. Only then will our work not run into walls.</p>
<p>The Youth Salvation Corps in the Fifth War Zone and the Youth Salvation Corps in Wuhan, although they have the same name and similar goals, in order to adapt to the environment, they did not merge with the × [Japanese], and are directly led by the commander-in-chief of the Fifth War Zone. They played a significant role in the battle to defend Xuzhou.</p>
<p>In Shaanxi, a teacher in a small school initiated the organization of a Small School Teachers' Union, which was hindered as a result. Another group of teachers in a small school organized a Teaching Method Research Association, which was able to succeed very smoothly. This research association implemented wartime education in the school, and also did many other anti-Japanese and national salvation work, which was highly praised by the authorities.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is impossible for the Chinese Student Organization Salvation Association in ××, but the Disaster Relief Association they organized can develop very smoothly.</p>
<p>The second lesson we have learned is that we must also analyze different young people and establish various different organizations according to their urgent needs and inherent traditions.</p>
<p>In a city where the youth movement is relatively sluggish, it is difficult to develop general youth organizations, but some young people organized a Mass Salvation Song and Drama Troupe, whose central work is singing, acting, holding symposiums, etc. Because it can suit the interests of the majority of young people, it has developed to more than 1,000 people and achieved great results.</p>
<p>For example, the factory youth in a certain city are not universally welcome to organizations such as the National Liberation Vanguard Youth Salvation Corps, but they are very enthusiastic about organizing hometown associations, because most of the factory workers there are from other provinces, so the organization of the hometown is very suitable for their needs.</p>
<p>Some rural youth in Shaanxi are not very welcome to the National Liberation Vanguard either, because they cannot easily understand its meaning. In some places, some people initiated the organization of a "Lengwa Corps," and they are very happy to participate. The so-called "Lengwa" is a Shaanxi dialect, specifically referring to a person who is good at fighting injustice and is not afraid of things. They are very familiar with the glorious tradition of "Lengwa" in the countryside, so they are very willing to join this organization and be an anti-Japanese "Lengwa."</p>
<p>The third lesson we have learned is that our organization must be open to the majority of young people. Only an open organization can become an organization for the majority of young people and can seek rapid development. Some organizations with a history, mass base, and work achievements can be open among the majority of young people, but the local authorities have not yet been able to give them legal status. At this time, it is especially necessary to adhere to the open policy. The open policy can first seek the recognition of the authorities, and second, it can seek the approval of the society. These two conditions can guarantee the widespread development of our organization.</p>
<p>The fourth lesson we have learned is that our organization must conduct necessary struggles against the adverse environment. Now our environment is obviously not always favorable. In many places, we still encounter unreasonable obstacles from various evil forces. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, we can certainly make necessary concessions, but if the concessions exceed a certain limit, it will instead mislead the overall situation, and the evil forces will instead make progress. This requires us to conduct necessary struggles. Some organizations lack the determination and ability to struggle, so they cannot withstand some blows. This not only weakens the strength of the youth movement, but also weakens the strength of the war of resistance. Therefore, if we want to develop our organization, we must understand how to properly combine necessary concessions and necessary struggles. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Battle for Qianjiang Intensifies: Our Forces Advance Rapidly Along the Xiang River to Encircle the Enemy; The Enemy Appears to Have New Plans on the Border of Henan and Hubei <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, 6th] It is reported that many Japanese officers and military experts are currently gathering in Nanjing, preparing to hold an important military conference to discuss plans for penetrating deeper into the Chinese mainland. It is said that the naval forces have also sent many representatives to participate in the conference.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Frontline reports have been very rampant in recent days. It is generally believed that Qianjiang is still occupied by the Japanese army, but because the rear is frequently attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in that area is in a very dangerous situation. According to Chinese sources, a unit of the Chinese army has crossed the Xiang River and advanced eastward, threatening the rear of the Japanese army in Qianjiang. At the same time, the Chinese army on the front is also launching a fierce attack on the area. It is likely that the outcome will be determined in a few days. The battle for Qianjiang has intensified since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 6th] The enemy in central Hubei, after suffering setbacks in their invasion of Suizhou and Zaoqiang, immediately dispersed and fled towards Tianmen, Yuekou, Yingcheng, Zaoshi and Anlu along the lower reaches of the Xiang River, and the areas around Yingcheng. They were intercepted by our large army in the Yuekou and Qianjiang areas and have no strength to continue their attacks. Another 10,000 or more enemy troops have recently gathered in Xinyang, and seem to have continued plans. A unit of our army has been closely monitoring them, and the enemy will certainly not succeed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 6th] An enemy plane flew over Miluo, Changsha, Changde and other places around 10:00 AM on the 6th for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 6th] On the morning of the 31st of last month, a unit of our army in eastern Henan attacked the enemy in Wuzili (west of Taikang), killing dozens of enemy soldiers. At the same time, artillery fire hit all targets, and fires broke out in several places inside the enemy stronghold. Soon, the enemy in Taikang rushed to reinforce them, but were ambushed by our forces en route, suffering heavy casualties. Our army then took advantage of the victory to advance towards Taikang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] A unit of our army in Hebei attacked Neiqiu the night before last. Near Toucun, they encountered the enemy. Our army launched a brave attack and, after three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled towards Liulin. In this battle, the enemy abandoned fifteen corpses and had more than forty wounded. We captured many rifles and hand grenades.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Once Entered</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yingde, 6th] According to military sources, a unit of our army suddenly entered the urban area of Guangzhou on the night of the 24th of last month, and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's gendarmerie headquarters in the northern district of the city. They fought fiercely with the enemy on Bianjing Street. Our army's actions were swift and tactics were clever, leaving the enemy exhausted. Many enemy soldiers were killed. At the same time, another unit of our army rushed into Xihua Road and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy and puppet forces, killing several guards of the puppet maintenance association on the spot. Several hours later, a large number of enemy troops stationed at Guanyin Mountain came to reinforce them, and enemy planes also strafed at low altitude. Our army fought fiercely with the enemy until dawn, and then bravely broke through and transferred to another location. In this battle, seventy or eighty enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. Our platoon leader Wu Hai died, and two soldiers were wounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 6th] The remnants of the enemy who were harassing Muzhou and Sanjiang have been completely wiped out. The puppet security team leader Zhao Shanzhan and chief of staff Li Xinyong, who were captured in this battle, have all been executed, much to the delight of the people. The situation in Jiangmen is currently stable. The main force of the enemy in Xinhui is still gathered in the area west of Xinhui City, confronting our forces.</p>
<h3 id="e4">20,000 Enemy Troops Invade Our Liulin; Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense in Western Shanxi; Enemy Planes Drop Leaflets Threatening to Invade Shaanxi; We Adopt Mobile Tactics to Fully Strike the Enemy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to Chinese reports, 20,000 Japanese troops have now arrived in Zhongyang and Lishi in western Shanxi, equipped with several heavy artillery pieces and dozens of steamships. It is suspected that they will advance westward from there, attacking the Chinese defense lines in Liulin, Jundu, and Ji Kou on the east bank of the Yellow River. They have also dispatched planes to drop leaflets over Tuokou, declaring that the Japanese army is determined to cross the Yellow River and attack Shaanxi. The Chinese army is fully prepared and plans to divide into two routes, northwest and west, to meet the Japanese army, and to destroy the communication between the advancing Japanese army and their rearguard, in order to prevent their advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingxian, 6th] The enemy invading Liulin, on the front, is approximately 500 strong in Liangjia Hui and Kongjia Shan (more than 20 li east of Liulin), with four artillery pieces attached. The enemy in Lijiawan and Jiaokou has also increased, and they are attacking our forces. On the right flank, approximately 400-500 enemy troops are in Xue Ling and Angou, 30 li south of Chugou. On the left flank, more than 1,500 enemy troops are detouring south through Han Jia Ling (north of Liulin), attempting to encircle Liulin. We are currently intercepting them on separate routes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingxian, 6th] This time, the enemy has mobilized elite forces to launch a large-scale westward invasion. Their division commander Anan has moved into Fenyang, and brigade commander Yamaguchi has also arrived in Lishi to command. The enemy on the Liulin front has been severely attacked by our forces and has not dared to advance further. Therefore, the enemy has adopted a policy of detouring and encircling, launching attacks from Zhongyang and Lishi in several routes from the north and south, attempting to occupy the ferry crossings of Qishi, Jundu, and Sanjiao, and then cross the river to invade Shaanxi. In recent days, after being severely attacked by our forces on separate routes, their momentum has been thwarted. The enemy advancing westward along the Lishi-Qishi road was severely attacked by a brigade of our army near Wang Laopo Mountain, and was ambushed and attacked from the flanks by two regiments of troops on both sides of the road. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with approximately 500-600 killed or wounded, and fled in a disorderly manner to the southeast. We are currently clearing out the remaining enemy forces on Wang Laopo Mountain and continuing to advance southeast to pursue them. A unit of more than 2,000 enemy troops advancing westward from Zhongyang occupied Liuyu (west of Zhongyang) on the 2nd, and then divided into two groups to attack northward. A unit of approximately 3,000 enemy troops is attacking Fengjia An (southeast of Liuyu) through Shibengtou and Fengjiazhuang, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with a division of our army. Also, a division of our army is now advancing between Sanjiao and Dawu, taking advantage of the victory to occupy the strongholds of Qiaojia Shan, Lijia Shan, and Matou Shan near Dawu. A regiment of our army is also actively operating in the northeastern mountains of Qishi, causing great panic among the enemy in Lishi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 6th] In southern Shanxi, on the 3rd, it was reported that several thousand enemy troops in Shuitou Town (north of Anyi) were harassing the areas around Yangcun and Dingcun (east of Anyi) on the afternoon of the 4th. They encountered a unit of our army and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy was subjected to intense artillery fire from our forces, suffering heavy casualties, and has retreated towards Xiacun. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, approximately 2,000 enemy troops in Anyi attacked Shuangmiao and Hanwang through Zhujiazhuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 5th] Enemy planes bombed Suide on both the 4th and 5th. Enemy planes also flew over Yijiawan and Qikou along the river on the morning of the 5th for reconnaissance.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Visiting the Buddhist Holy Site of Ta'er Monastery (Part 1) <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Sui</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent Report from Qinghai] Before we came to Qinghai, we were told by friends who had been to Qinghai that we must go to Ta'er Monastery once, where we could see the authentic works left by the Buddhist revolutionary Tsongkhapa. Committee Member Xie Cizhou, who came with us, also tried his best to ensure that we did not make the trip in vain. However, although Xining is only twenty li away from Ta'er Monastery, one must either ride livestock or take a carriage, which is very inconvenient. There was only one Ford car belonging to Chairman Ma in Xining City, and there was no way to rent one. Later, Committee Member Xie personally came forward to borrow Chairman Ma's only car in Xining on our behalf, and Chairman Ma generously agreed. So, we decided to set off at 7:00 AM on May 4th. In addition to Mr. Zhang, the travelers included Inspector Ma and Councilor Ma from the provincial government.</p>
<p>Our car left the west gate of the city, and along the way, we saw white poplars and green willows planted on both sides of the road. The newly planted saplings were too numerous to count, which showed that the authorities paid attention to afforestation. The villages we passed all had county-run elementary schools, and the schoolchildren were carrying their schoolbags on their way to school. The students' clothing depended on whether their families were rich or poor, and they were not forced to wear the same school uniforms, which also demonstrated the spirit of Guangxi. When we were about to reach Luosha Town, we saw a Muslim elementary school established by the Muslim Promotion Association. The school buildings were neat and the grounds were quite large. Like the Muslim Middle School in the city, they also conducted military training. Luosha Town is a place where Han and Tibetan people trade with each other, but not during the review meeting. The goods were not concentrated, and the trade was naturally very slack. It is said that foreign firms used to be established there, specializing in buying Tibetan products, which shows the prosperity of trade in the past. After passing Luosha Town, we saw towering buildings and pavilions lined up in the green willows. That was the Buddhist holy site of Ta'er Monastery.</p>
<p>We first drove past eight lama pagodas and the Little Golden Tile Hall, and went straight to the office building, known as "Gongben Jiwa" in Tibetan. Xiangzuo Gengdun Daji guided us through the entire monastery. "Xiangzuo" is similar to the abbot of a southern monastery, but their Xiangzuo are divided into three types: in charge of grain, in charge of accounts, and in charge of general affairs, commonly known as the First Master, Second Master, and Third Master. The Second Master, who was guiding us, was already fifty-eight years old, with a burly body. He had lived in Yonghe Palace in Beijing for many years in the past, so he spoke fluent Mandarin. He was very sincere and was very warm to us as soon as we met. He accompanied us on our visit. We first visited the Great Sutra Hall, which was built with reference to both Chinese and Western architecture, and was extremely magnificent. The area was very large, and it was said that it could accommodate 3,000 lamas to worship and chant sutras. The pillars in front of the hall were similar in model to the Dacheng Hall in Qufu, but unfortunately the pillars were all wrapped in red cloth, so we could not see their original appearance. The pillars in the hall were all covered with valuable Tibetan felt, and the kneeling pads were made of precious carpets, which were as long as the width of the hall. However, each lama monk's kneeling place formed its own circular pattern, which could be used as a substitute for a futon.</p>
<p>Further inside was the Sutra Lecture Hall, a magnificent building containing Buddhist scriptures in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit. The collection of Tibetan scriptures is the most abundant in the country. According to Buddhist scriptures and precepts, they divided the Tripitaka into three colleges, and after the lamas in the entire monastery had studied the classics for a considerable period of time and passed strict examinations, they were sent to each college to conduct more in-depth research. The Vinaya College was further divided into medicine and astronomy. Today happened to be the oral examination period for Aja Khutuktu. The so-called Khutuktu means "saint" and is the highest authority among the lamas. Aja is his name. All the lamas who were taking the exam, except for a part who were sitting on the ground around Aja, were being interviewed by Aja in person. The rest were in the square in front of the college, divided into three major groups, each group further divided into several small groups. In each small group, one person stood in front of the crowd to ask questions, and the rest sat around to be tested. Each question was limited to a certain time to answer. If the answer was correct, the person in the middle would clap his hands to express approval. Otherwise, he would strike the backs of his hands together to indicate that the answer did not match the question. Those who answered incorrectly would first be punished by having their rosary beads hung around their necks, the second time they would press their necks with their hands, and the third time they would rub their necks with their hands to humiliate them. What they were being tested on was Buddhist epistemology, which is also a department of argumentation. They measured the depth of Buddhist learning by the level of epistemology, which is like logic being the gateway to studying various disciplines, and the reasoning is actually the same. We saw the solemn and calm attitude of the people who were asking the questions, the expressions of the people who were thinking and responding, and the spirit of the people who were listening attentively to the questions and answers. The questioners made decisive decisions when the answers were right or wrong, making gestures to express acceptance or rejection. The style was graceful and generous, like an experienced official judging a case. As for Aja's style, it was like that of a learned scholar. His method of lecturing was completely autonomous, with the listeners freely asking questions and then correcting them. It is said that before lamas enter each college for research, they must pass strict examinations. Each person can take the exam three times, and if they fail the third time, they will lose their qualifications to study a major. It is also said that there are many original Indian texts of the scriptures on Vinaya in the monastery that have not been translated into Tibetan, so lamas studying Vinaya still regard studying in India as the only way out.</p>
<p>Further inside is the Great Golden Tile Hall, which was built specifically to commemorate their ancestor Tsongkhapa. The copper tiles on the roof of the hall are plated with gold, hence the name Great Golden Tile Hall. The roof decorations are also made of copper and plated with gold, making it as splendid as possible. The hall is three stories high. In the center of the hall is an image of Tsongkhapa, said to be cast in pure gold, and displays his finger-blood self-portrait sent to his mother when he taught in Tibet, his childhood footprints left in the stone mouth, and all other relics. In front of the statue, the ghee lamps burned brightly. It is said that they have not been extinguished since the hall was built. Under the eaves of the hall, the ground is paved with wooden strips. Lamas come from as far away as Mongolia and Tibet, determined to kowtow what they call "equal-body heads" in front of the image of Tsongkhapa, which is to first kneel on their knees, then stretch out their hands to hold their heads in front of them, and then kowtow their heads on the ground, a five-body prostration. We saw seven marks on the board, which were formed by rubbing the ground with both hands, both knees, both toes, and one head. It is said that they count 10,000 kowtows as fulfilling one wish, and the more wishes they have, the more kowtows they perform. Moreover, some people start counting from the moment they leave their homes, kowtowing every step of the way until they reach the Great Golden Tile Hall of Ta'er Monastery. If the person making the wish runs out of travel expenses and cannot continue to move forward, they remember the location where they stopped and beg for food to return to their hometown, in order to accumulate another sum of money so that they can go to Ta'er Monastery again from there to fulfill their wish step by step. Leaving aside this method, their spirit of moving forward without fear of setbacks is truly admirable. If they could transfer this spirit to studying and establishing a career, they would be bound to succeed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 6th] Colonel Spear, military attache of the British Embassy in China, and interpreter Kou Bo, were detained by the Japanese military authorities in Zhangjiakou. However, they are now safe. Colonel Spear has sent a letter to Mr. Lambert, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, and Major Dillaman, commander of the British forces in Tianjin. Lambert and Dillaman were ordered to go to Zhangjiakou to investigate the matter, but the Japanese military refused to allow them to see Spear, only allowing them to deliver letters. Spear also sent a reply. Lambert and Dillaman have now returned to Peiping. Colonel Spear was detained by the Japanese military in Zhangjiakou on the 26th of last month, and Kou Bo was also detained when he went to investigate.</p>
<p>[Foreign News from This Port] According to a strange report released by the Japanese Allied Press this morning, on May 15th, the Japanese military authorities obtained intelligence that several foreigners of unknown names were staying in Bian Shou Village (transliteration), Zhuolu County, about 35 miles southeast of Zhangjiakou. The Japanese military police were ordered to rush to the designated location and take two British officials to the Japanese military police headquarters in Zhangjiakou. After interrogation, it was learned that one of the arrested was Colonel Spear. Spear was appointed to a new position in Shanghai in October last year by the British Ambassador. In February this year, he left Shanghai by boat, via Hong Kong, and went to Hanoi. From Hanoi, he flew to Chongqing. After arriving in Chongqing, he met with leaders of the National Government scattered in various places, and inspected the actions of the Chinese army, such as the Eighth Route Army in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hebei, and other provinces. Afterwards, Spear entered Shanxi from the important base of the Eighth Route Army in Shaanxi, and then arrived at Shuang Shou Village in southern Chahar via Kelan, Wutai, and Yangjiahe. During the journey from Yan'an to Chahar, Spear walked on foot, and compiled a report on the situation in the Japanese-occupied areas. He used the Eighth Route Army's radio telegraph to send it to Peiping and Shanghai. When Spear was in Yangjiahe, Shanxi, he sent his Chinese partner to Peiping to contact the British Embassy. The embassy's interpreter, Kou Bo, went to find Spear without properly contacting the Japanese authorities in advance. The two of them also hid everywhere for three days in order to avoid being searched by the Japanese. The local Japanese military authorities attached great importance to this case, because they felt that the two of them had deliberately entered the Japanese military-occupied area from enemy territory to collect various intelligence and transmit it to the Kuomintang and the Eighth Route Army. Furthermore, the Japanese military authorities had issued a notice that foreigners who wished to travel in the war zone must obtain the understanding of the Japanese military authorities in advance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 6th] According to a report from the Japanese Allied Press, Colonel Spear and interpreter Kou Bo were detained by the Japanese military because they were "ordinary spies." Spear was wearing civilian clothes in an attempt to avoid being detained by the Japanese military. The Japanese military authorities allowed Lambert and Dillaman to transmit letters and exchange opinions with Colonel Spear, and learned that Spear is currently safe. Officials from the British Embassy said that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government in Tokyo. Japanese officials claim that the Japanese military has its own designated methods for dealing with foreigners who travel in Japanese-occupied areas without the permission of the Japanese authorities. The British authorities have been notified in advance. A Japanese spokesman said that the British authorities had expressed that they did not understand the Japanese position. Although Colonel Spear and Kou Bo have been detained for nine days, they cannot be allowed to meet with Lambert, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, and Dillaman, commander of the British forces in Tianjin, because "the investigation has not been completed."</p>
<h3 id="e12">Debate in the British House of Commons; Disputes Between Britain and Japan in China <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Foreign Secretary Butler reported on the latest situation in China during question time in the House of Commons today. He stated, "There have been battles in the Han River area of central China. There have been no major changes in the original front lines. The general situation in the Shanghai International Settlement is essentially unchanged. The troops landed on Gulangyu have not been withdrawn and are continuing negotiations to find a solution. British and American Marines remain ashore. Regarding the detention of British officials by the Japanese, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy and a British Army liaison officer are returning to Peiping with the latest news. (The above two people were ordered to go to Zhangjiakou on June 1 to investigate the truth). The entire matter is being negotiated with the Japanese military authorities and the Japanese government. As for Japan's claim to have the right to blockade Chinese seaports, Japan announced a blockade of the Chinese coast after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, but stated that its blockade was limited to Chinese ships. If Japan attempts to extend its blockade to foreign ships, it would de facto become a belligerent, but since China and Japan have not officially declared war, this action would be illegal. The British government has fully expressed this view to the Japanese government." Conservative Party Member Morgan questioned the government whether it would consider the "Lanpura" incident to be closed based on the Japanese explanation that there was a misunderstanding about the ship's nationality. Butler replied, "We have always agreed that if the Japanese have doubts about whether a ship belongs to Britain, they can board the ship for inspection. There is no doubt about the misunderstanding in the 'Lanpura' incident, so we have taken a firm stance and have received an explanation from the Japanese side." When asked whether the government considered this explanation satisfactory, Butler replied, "Yes." Replying to another question, Butler said, "The Prime Minister is aware that the Japanese naval representative in Qingdao has strictly ordered that a separate loading and unloading certificate must be obtained for each bill of lading for all British goods, and is aware that due to this procedure, British goods often have to be abandoned on the pier for several days, while there are no restrictions on Japanese goods. Regarding the issue of warehouses, if goods stored are Japanese, they must be carefully distinguished and the ones they like are stored. However, they do not provide any assistance in distinguishing British goods." When asked whether the Prime Minister would indicate to the Japanese government that if it did not rescind these unequal restrictions, British ports would treat Japanese ships in the same way, Butler replied, "Negotiations are currently underway with the Japanese authorities in Qingdao, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also protested to the Japanese government, requesting more warehouse space to facilitate the storage of British goods."</p>

<p>Editorial: Achievements and Prospects of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly</p>
<p>The first session of the Provisional Assembly of Guangdong Province concluded on the 28th of last month after two weeks of effort. Resolutions on politics, military affairs, people's movement, economy, culture, education, and other matters have been seen in various newspapers in recent days, and the full text of the closing declaration was also disclosed yesterday.</p>
<p>Reviewing the achievements of the first session of the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Assembly, in addition to various valuable resolutions, we believe that the following points should be particularly emphasized and expressed in the declaration for all parties to value. First, it solemnly points out to the 35 million compatriots in Guangdong that only by adhering to unity under the leadership of our wise supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, adhering to a protracted war, a full-scale war, and striving for the initiative can we save ourselves, save the country, build the province, and build the nation. Furthermore, based on the situation of China and the international situation, it points out the basis for our inevitable victory in the war of resistance and national construction. Second, it solemnly points out to the 35 million compatriots in Guangdong that "those two or three with mistaken understanding and weak will [omitted text] are like slag in a furnace, eliminated after prolonged forging, making the future of the war of resistance even brighter." This further sweeps away the poisonous atmosphere spread by Wang Jingwei and his ilk of "using anti-communism and peace to save China," clarifies the vision of our Guangdong compatriots, and strengthens their will to support the government and persist in the war of resistance. Third, this session solemnly and painfully declared that "those in power are afflicted by arbitrariness and opportunism, leading to division and infighting, plunging the nation and the state into irredeemable danger... We can indeed reconcile and harmonize matters through human effort... Then, political clarity can be expected, and people's livelihoods will gradually become affluent." In fact, not only does future political clarity and affluent livelihoods rely on abandoning arbitrariness and opportunism and relying on reconciliation and harmony, but also, in the present moment, if we want to prevent the [omitted text] from penetrating deeper and save Guangdong and our country from danger, it is essential for the government, the army, and the people to refrain from arbitrariness and opportunism, eliminate partisan prejudices, and reconcile in sincere unity!</p>
<p>We express our highest respect for the achievements of this session of the Assembly, which allows us to foresee an infinitely bright future for Guangdong Province and the overall war of resistance and national construction! However, we must solemnly point out that since the war of resistance has entered its second phase, the [omitted text] situation has begun to change dramatically, and Guangdong Province is increasingly important in determining the success or failure of the war of resistance and national construction. How can we consolidate the unity between the government, the army, and the people? How can we consolidate the cooperation of various anti-Japanese parties to concentrate efforts on the war of resistance and national construction? How can we earnestly and effectively mobilize the strength of the people to enhance the fighting power of the front lines? To develop combat behind enemy lines? To assist the growth of new forces in the rear? To stop the [omitted text] offensive and plan our country's future counter-offensive? How can we implement democracy to improve political institutions? Promote people's livelihood to improve the people's lives and relieve refugees in various places? How can we develop economic construction as the basis for building the province and the country? All of these are urgent problems that need to be solved to save us from our perilous situation. After this first session of the Assembly, the senators of Guangdong Province, under the leadership of the highest authorities, should assist the wise military and political authorities, selflessly lead the people of the province, promote truly talented individuals, cultivate young cadres, and strive for the thorough implementation of all resolutions of this session, working together to achieve the thorough implementation of the wartime administrative program of Guangdong Province! The people of Guangdong have glorious revolutionary and combat experience and lessons. In the future, they will surely advance and carry forward this spirit to strive for the final victory of China's liberation. This is what we humbly pray for and encourage each other to do.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A bill allocating $100 million for the U.S. government to purchase military raw materials was passed through all congressional procedures today and is now awaiting President Roosevelt's signature.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] Secretary of War Harry Woodring appeared before the House Appropriations Committee today, requesting the passage of funds to add several locks to the Panama Canal for the exclusive use of the Navy when necessary. In his speech, he stated that the world situation is extremely tense, and countries are competing to expand their military forces. The United States can no longer rest easy because the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans serve as barriers. From a military perspective, the Americas are no longer another continent but are closely related to other continents. This is what the people should understand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee began drafting a new bill today to amend the Neutrality Act. State Department Assistant Secretary Moore, Director Chuck Haworth, and legal expert Savage were invited to attend to explain the State Department's views. After a lengthy discussion, the committee passed the first article of the bill proposed by Committee Chairman Pittman by a majority vote and scheduled to continue discussing other articles tomorrow. According to the current Neutrality Act, the existence of a state of war should be determined by the President, and the implementation of the Neutrality Act should be announced. The article passed now authorizes the President to declare the existence of a state of war when the peace of the United States and the lives of American citizens are threatened. In this sense, the President will have greater freedom to invoke the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>British Submarine Disaster</p>
<p>Chamberlain Issues Report</p>
<p>London Mayor Launches Donation Drive to Aid Bereaved Families</p>
<p>British Cabinet to Decide on Investigation Method Today</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain gave a lengthy report in the House of Commons today on the Thetis submarine disaster, stating that the sinking of the Thetis submarine was not due to carrying extra personnel but was actually caused by the flooding of the two front compartments of the submarine. The water entered through the torpedo tubes at the bow. It is unknown how the torpedo tube doors became open or whether they were already open when the submarine submerged. The submarine's signaling device was damaged and could not communicate with surface ships. Although buoys and smoke signals were released, they were not immediately seen. Efforts were made to raise the rear of the submarine to the surface to drill a hole for rescue, but they were unsuccessful. It is believed that three people attempted to escape at the same time as the first group, but this proved fatal, and they were dragged back into the submarine. The Prime Minister stated that various methods had been exhausted to rescue the personnel in the submarine. An attempt was made to lighten the submarine so that the stern could float to the surface. After the Plaxton rescue ship learned of the submarine's location and released sound signals, two people inside the submarine used Davis escape apparatus to float to the surface and were rescued. One of them was the captain, Oram, who risked his life to escape using the escape apparatus. At that time, he reported that everyone in the submarine was still alive but in a very dangerous situation. Later, two more people escaped to the surface. Divers then entered the sea to work but encountered great difficulties. It was originally intended to raise the rear of the submarine to the surface to drill a hole for rescue, but under the circumstances, drilling a hole would easily flood the submarine, which would be unfair. Subsequently, although repeated attempts were made to float the submarine, it gradually became heavier. After the three people who attempted to escape using the escape apparatus perished, no one else used the escape apparatus to try to escape. Rescue personnel later knew that there was no hope for the lives of the people in the submarine and turned to rescuing the submarine. The Prime Minister continued, saying that the Lars Company is providing compensation to the families of the deceased employees, and the Mayor of London has launched a public donation in accordance with national public opinion to provide financial assistance to the families of the deceased. He expressed his deep condolences on behalf of the government and the two houses for the loss of the Thetis submarine. An official then asked whether a public inquiry into the Thetis submarine disaster should wait until the submarine has been rescued from the sea. Chamberlain replied that this should be done as soon as possible, but before the submarine is raised, the internal situation of the submarine cannot be investigated, so the proceedings may not be fully conclusive.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Mayor of London has launched a donation drive to provide relief to the families of those who died in the Thetis submarine disaster. The King and Queen, Queen Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Connaught, the Princess Royal, and the Earl of Harewood have all agreed to donate. Leaders of local civil authorities have also telegraphed, responding to the Mayor of London and starting donation drives.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] It is reported that the government is currently considering the method of investigating the Thetis submarine disaster, which will be the same as the method of investigating the R101 airship disaster, that is, a signed lawyer and expert jurors will conduct the investigation together. The British Cabinet will make a formal decision on this matter on the 7th of this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] It has been reported here that the King of Italy, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the King of Belgium have sent condolences for the tragic Thetis submarine disaster.</p>
<p>False Alarm - Attempted Assassination of British King's Younger Brother's Wife</p>
<p>Duchess of Kent Safe</p>
<p>Suspicious Elderly Man Arrested Late at Night</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 6th] A shocking incident occurred last night involving an attempted shooting of the Duchess of Kent, the wife of the British King's younger brother. The incident occurred around 9 p.m. when the Duchess of Kent was going to watch an American film with another noblewoman named Portarlington. The film starred the beautiful actress Merle Oberon. The Scotland Yard Detective Department announced at 10 p.m. that the Duchess of Kent and others were safe. In fact, the Duchess did not know that someone had shot at them until she arrived at the cinema. After hearing the news, they decided to continue watching the film. A suspect was arrested late at night. This person arrived in the UK from Australia three weeks ago and is quite old. The authorities are not willing to release his name. It is said that the suspect had suspicious activities near the Duchess's residence. It is claimed that this person used a shotgun to fire in the direction of the Duchess's vehicle.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Duchess of Kent heard gunshots last night while going to watch a film with the noblewoman Portarlington. The Duchess of Kent and others were unharmed and did not know that someone had shot at them until they left the cinema. A suspect was arrested by the police near the location of the shooting, but no charges have been laid yet. After the incident, the Duke and Duchess of Kent's residence on Belgrave Square was guarded by three security guards, but the guard has been reduced to one person this morning. One of the windows of the Princess Royal's house was shattered by a small bullet. It is reported that the police authorities do not consider this matter important.</p>

<p>The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East</p>
<p>By Shudi</p>
<p>(Continued from May 29th) The British plan, from beginning to end, is one-sided, the so-called cooperation in resisting German and Italian aggression against third countries, rather than an alliance that shares its fortunes with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, on the contrary, insisted on a mutually beneficial tacit agreement similar to an alliance. Thus, there was another pause here.</p>
<p>In this way, Chamberlain presented a very obvious situation to Hitler: attacking Britain and France would inevitably involve the Soviet Union, but attacking the Soviet Union would not necessarily involve Britain and France. However, Hitler ignored this and continued to cooperate with Mussolini, preparing for further blackmail against Britain and France. On the Soviet side, of course, it could not long expose itself to the danger of being attacked and had to take self-defense measures. Thus, the Foreign Minister Litvinov, who advocated collective security most strongly, resigned at this moment, neither too early nor too late.</p>
<p>Litvinov's resignation was a clear demonstration to Britain and France. For a considerable period, Britain was indeed shocked. However, what shocked them even more was the news of a Soviet-German rapprochement, which suddenly became clamorous.</p>
<p>(2) The Possibility of a Buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany</p>
<p>If Britain does not correct its current illusions and make the greatest determination, then a buffer between the Soviet Union and Germany is not only possible but inevitable. The key to success or failure lies in whether Germany can make Poland maintain its neutrality as a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Germany. Apart from this, the conditions for a tacit understanding between the Soviet Union and Germany already exist. (1) The Soviet Union's anti-aggression attention is now not in Europe but in the Far East. (2) Germany's coveted objects are the colonies of Britain and France, not Ukraine. (3) China's war of resistance has created a new situation in the Far East, weakening Japanese fascism and creating new hope for the Soviet Union to gain the assistance of a powerful friendly country in the East. At the same time, it has also increased German and Italian suspicion of Japan's power to threaten Britain and France. Under the situation of closer ties between China and the Soviet Union and Japan's gradual inability to echo Germany and Italy, coupled with Britain and France's continued alienation from the Soviet Union, then the future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly show a considerable degree of tacit understanding.</p>
<p>This is just theory. What is the reality? Recently, it is worth noting that one of Stalin's closest confidants, David Kandalaki, suddenly appeared in Berlin. Everyone knows that this Kandalaki had visited Berlin several times before to promote German-Soviet rapprochement, and the most successful time was his trip to Germany in mid-April 1937. At that time, it was on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, and the Soviet Union was very willing to obtain a considerable understanding with Germany. However, because of Hitler's arrogance at that time, the understanding that had already been drafted ultimately failed at the last minute. The current situation is different. The strength of Japan in the East has been greatly reduced. At this time, this gentleman's visit to Berlin is a headache for Britain and France.</p>
<p>There is also a second matter. According to the opinions of the German military authorities recently, if Germany wants to expand again, then, in any case, it must obtain the prior condition of Soviet non-interference or inability to interfere. According to their estimates, if this point can be achieved, then Germany and Italy can immediately make territorial demands on Britain and France. Britain and France would absolutely not dare to fight back. Even if the war were to start, Britain would definitely withdraw halfway, leaving France alone to be dominated by Germany and Italy. Therefore, when Japan recently proposed the issue of attacking the Soviet Union to Germany, the German side immediately rejected it. Subsequently, Germany instead proposed new ideas to Japan, which were roughly: (1) The decisive point in the current Sino-Japanese War lies in the overall situation in Europe, not in East Asia. Japan will inevitably fail if it continues to fight in this way. (2) If Japan is willing to echo Germany and Italy in threatening Britain and France so that Germany and Italy can achieve a decisive victory in Europe, then at that time, Germany and Italy are willing to devote all their efforts to helping Japan to deal with the Soviet Union. (3) To fulfill the current mission, Japan should take a completely defensive posture in the various battlefields in China, but at the same time, send a naval fleet to the Mediterranean and a considerable number of ground and air forces to Africa. Although this plan has not been realized, it is very clear that Germany and Italy currently have no intention of dealing with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Because of these phenomena, the current Britain is filled with worry about a German-Soviet tacit understanding everywhere. Let me give two examples here. The first is a warning that appeared recently in The Times. This warning was issued by its correspondent in Rome. He reminded the British people to never forget what Hitler said in 1930, which was that he wanted to "give India to the Soviet Union and divide Africa among Italy." The second, a sentence in a book in Britain is currently receiving much discussion and attention. The book is a recent work by an Australian Dr. Duleker, entitled "The End of Economic Men," and the famous saying is, "From whatever angle you look at it, a Soviet-German rapprochement is almost inevitable unless there is a large-scale war in the near future that can prevent it--the so-called near future being 1940 at the latest." This famous saying was written long before Britain's policy change this time, but it is still worth noting.</p>
<p>However, what is described in this section, from the perspective of Britain and France, can only be said to be shadows. In addition, there has also been a bright side recently. What is the bright side? It is:</p>

<p>Central Market Requests for Rent Reduction Denied More Than Thirty Stallholders to Move Out Authorities Remain Firm and Unresponsive Former Tenants Moving Out Will Call for New Tenants to Take Over</p>
<p>After the completion and opening of the new Central Market, it caused a sensation for a time due to its convenient location and magnificent architecture. In particular, the competition among merchants bidding for stalls in the city was fierce, and the bids were high, which was rare in the past. However, less than a week after the market opened, business was not prosperous, which was far from what people generally expected. Merchants began to feel that the rent was too high to sustain. Therefore, some closed down after only a few days of operation, and some who won bids dared not open for business. Those who continued to operate, apart from a few who made a small profit, were mostly in a precarious situation. However, because they had paid two months' rent in advance before the opening, they reluctantly supported themselves, waiting for the situation to improve. Recently, more than 30 households, including those selling chickens, ducks, vegetables, and meat, submitted a request to the Municipal Health Bureau due to poor business and excessive rent, requesting that they be considered for the difficulties of the merchants and that the rent be reduced appropriately to maintain business. The Health Authority, limited by municipal regulations, was unable to approve the merchants' request and rejected it. The merchants in the market, unable to obtain a solution to their request, submitted a request to the authorities on the 31st of last month for the sake of preserving their capital, stating that they would move out by the end of this month to avoid suffering greater losses. The merchants preparing to move out have recently been carrying out all the relocation procedures, and some have been looking for business locations outside the city as a fallback plan for the future. Some have already stopped operating and will wait until the end of the month to move. It is reported that the authorities have decided that after these stallholders move out, or in early July, they will put the vacant stalls out for bid. The rent will be based on what was paid by the original stallholders and will not be reduced. However, according to the current business situation in the Central Market, [text incomplete].</p>

The police later found the defendant on the passenger list of the Quanzhou Lun and the guest list of the hotel. The defendant said he had forgotten. The official finally sentenced the defendant to a fine of ten dollars.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Rotary Club Elects New Officers</p>
<p>Berlin Mei Elected President Hu Huide as Vice President</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Rotary Club held its election of officers for this term last Tuesday and immediately elected Berlin Mei as President, Hu Huide as Vice President, Tang Rongyao as Honorary Secretary, and Bada as Honorary Treasurer. The directors are Huo Jia, Miezuer, Feng Bingfen, Ross, and Weiyue Man.

Chairman Huo Jia gave a speech, first welcoming Guangzhou Rotary Club member Hua Liyasi and guest Chen Pishi, and announced that a board meeting would be held next Monday at 5:15 PM, followed by introducing Professor Bulong's lecture on "Spitsbergen" (Arctic place name). He said, "I lectured on the various aspects of Iceland some years ago. Now I will describe the journey to Spitsbergen. It may be interesting or not. The departure date was July 31, 1938, departing from a fishing port in northern England. Thirty hours later, I saw a mountain 7,000 feet high with snow covering its peak. The Norwegian government has an important meteorological station there to report the weather to Europe. Later, I arrived at King's Bay, where the snow was very thick and the coal mine production was quite abundant, with a railway for transportation. This is the northernmost railway in the world. Spitsbergen has no trees at all. There are some, but they are only small Arctic willows, less than six inches high. However, there are many other flowers, and the interior has grasslands, but not where we were scheduled to go. There are many flowers and plants, and there is no plant testing ground. The work has been quite remarkable. According to the records, there are a total of 130 kinds of flowers and hundreds of kinds of moss. Birds are also tight. This is what we find strange, mostly blue gulls, and their nests are almost all built underground. When we walked past, the blue birds flew over our heads, chattering endlessly, as if scolding us. Some of the people who were not wearing head protection were often pecked by the birds flying down, so when we returned to the ship, there were several people with head injuries and bleeding. At that time, we only had cameras and no weapons, so we could not retaliate, so we had to adopt a non-interference policy. It is said that this kind of bird flies from this Arctic Ocean to the Southern Ocean once a year, because it is cold and hates</p>

<p>Free Talk: A Trip to the Isolated Island By Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>When the last express train from Hanoi arrived in Haiphong, it was already 2:00 AM. I was still identifying the characters for "Shanghai Bound" on the luggage piled up like small hills, all written in chalk. I felt a little joy and wrote it down like this.</p>
<p>Three days ago, when I boarded the train, a friend held my hand and asked:</p>
<p>"Why do you want to go to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." It was for a personal matter, but I didn't think that would be a convincing reason for my friend. And in fact, I didn't know what it was for besides this simple reason.</p>
<p>"I know. To be honest, I want to go back too." He squeezed my hand even tighter.</p>
<p>"Then, shall we go together?" I smiled vaguely. In this way, even I felt that I was being envied. Envy for being able to feel a little joy for those chalk-written characters at the Haiphong station. Although traveling through many boats and cars, in a world of coal dust, it is mostly a distant and arduous journey; however, the road still leads directly to Shanghai. All roads lead to Rome.</p>
<p>Now, the arduous and distant journey has begun. I only say it's for two years of missing, missing Shanghai like a long-lost friend. It should be said that this is such a ridiculous thing. From the day I set off, in order to make it clear to myself that I missed this long-lost friend, I missed her with all my might, and I reorganized my language knowledge from two years ago.</p>
<p>Jumping on the train, I said to the people seeing me off on the platform: "Go back!" Using the Shanghai dialect I knew two years ago. Since then, I never let go of every opportunity to speak. As long as the opportunity comes to me, I use the Shanghai dialect from another era without hesitation. I spoke it six or seven years ago, and in these two years, it has been abandoned. When I accidentally stepped on an Annamese person's foot, I repeatedly apologized, but he glared at me fiercely.</p>
<p>I left a place I was attached to and set off to a place I missed. This journey cannot be completed in a day or even ten days. So the train threw me down for the first time, throwing me into a lonely small town. The station pointed me to a nearby hotel. At night, because the mountain road in the dark was dangerous, the train stopped and rested on the platform. But this was not where I was going, but I was forced to stay here, staying between the two places of attachment and longing. The desolation lacks descriptive words, and I can't say how I left a night's name in this hotel.</p>
<p>The next day, the train started again, and the loneliness on the train was still unbearable. I found a fellow traveler among the passengers using Shanghai dialect, thin and short, with teeth yellowed by cigarettes. When he spoke, his eyes stared at people, and his words were as numerous and trivial as his saliva, spraying out in strands. He was a cigarette merchant, interspersing his pure Shanghai dialect with Ningbo dialect with the meaning of the marketplace, as if he was conducting a batch of transactions with anyone at any time.</p>
<p>"Look, there are bananas all over the mountains and plains, why don't they know to pick them and sell them!"</p>
<p>The train slowly arrived at Anpei Chegu, barefoot Annamese women crowded into the car doors, baskets filled with bananas and plantains picked from the wild; when the Annamese women moved the bananas back and forth in front of him, he complained: These are wild bananas. "Yes, the exchange rate is too expensive, one yuan and eight jiao can only be exchanged for one yuan."</p>
<p>But I just smiled lowly. Despite how much I hated such people in the past, now I really don't have the ability to turn my face away and avoid such people. I miss Shanghai. Words that I haven't said in two years are now appearing on my lips again, and such people are exactly what I need now.</p>
<p>I explained how eagerly I wanted to see Shanghai and asked him why he wanted to return to Shanghai from Chongqing.</p>
<p>"Is it because of the bombing of Chongqing?"</p>
<p>"No, even if there's no bombing, I have to go back. How can I not go back?"</p>
<p>Then he started spitting more saliva, and his conclusion was that Shanghai was still very important. A cigarette factory moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Hankou because of the war, but part of it remained in Shanghai. Their cigarette company monopolized the sales rights of this factory, and the main task of this trip was of course to appeal to cigarette smokers in the interior. However, "to be honest, since the Anti-Japanese War, the price of cigarettes has never been raised in the factory." Shanghai is still very important because only the cigarette factories in Shanghai have not raised the prices of their products. In addition, he wanted to send his family from Hong Kong back to Shanghai, and then bring his brothers from Shanghai back to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Of course, this matter alone might not cause him to make such an expensive trip. He had more affairs. In short, Shanghai is still very important, is his conclusion.</p>
<p>The presentation of the problem is often adapted to the opposite side. He was really too excited, so I grabbed a question and planned to make him feel a little disappointed. So I said.</p>
<p>"Shanghai is very unreliable, don't send your family to the enemy's place."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about! It won't happen. Shanghai will be ours forever."</p>
<p>His saliva was sprayed out in strands, his eyes were turning all over me, and he went on. Shanghai is our place, we rent it to foreigners, and then sublet it to us. The second landlord and the tenant all live in the same house: How difficult it is to break in and occupy it! One… I failed.</p>
<p>Although I don't entirely like his statement, this metaphor interested me. A businessman, burned by the fires of war for the past year or two, sees money in his eyes, and what the war makes him lose is also money. He ran to Chongqing, and his conclusion was that Shanghai is still very important and will be ours forever.</p>
<p>In any case, Shanghai is still passable, because it is our place. This is why I felt a little joy when I saw the words written in chalk and wrote it down like this.</p>
<p>Five Minutes (2) By Luo Feng</p>
<p>Although He Zheng's appearance was very peaceful; his heart was pounding like a clanking shackle, and he felt the sound of his heart pounding, drowning out the clanging of the shackles.</p>
<p>How to die? He wasted a lot of precious time guessing this novel mystery. He first guessed that they would not use guns, and secondly... there were so many unimaginable ways to kill him. He couldn't determine in advance which method would be used. He thought: Everything will be clear in five minutes, and everything will be over!</p>
<p>His watch had been confiscated by the enemy soldiers. Now he didn't have a more accurate timepiece to calculate the length of those five minutes. According to the usual test, every seventy heartbeats equals one minute, then about three hundred and fifty heartbeats would be close to that time. So he walked forward leisurely, pressing his wrist with the watch in the other hand, but before he could press on the pulse, he separated his hands as if he was shocked. He felt that this action was really stupid and boring.</p>
<p>The footsteps continued slowly. Every iron ring on his feet opened his clanging throat, singing an extremely monotonous marching song. The four suburbs of this desolate mountain also echoed distantly at the same time...</p>
<p>He didn't know how long he had been walking, but he knew that it must not have exceeded five minutes, otherwise he would immediately fall dead on the barren mountain.</p>
<p>He began to curse this moonless night. In this night, nothing could be seen except for layers of darkness. As for the future, no, maybe at the moment, when that terrible moment came, it would be difficult to see what method the enemy would use to eliminate his life. He Zheng regarded such a death as the biggest regret in his life.</p>
<p>Time slowed down as if it was going backwards. A long time ago, He Zheng always felt that every pause in breathing had the chance to stop breathing forever, but now that chance seemed to never be realized.</p>
<p>Just as He Zheng's mind was very confused, a rough hand suddenly pushed him from behind, so his whole body staggered forward a few steps diagonally, and finally, he was tripped by something huge and hard. His chest hung on that thing, and his head hung upside down. Within ten seconds, he did not change his position, and he silently伏在那廢, waiting to accept the unknowable death. At this time, his hearing discovered the snorting of beasts, and that snorting was close at hand. He knew that he had been thrown into the beasts. So he stood up instinctively and grinned at the snorting. Two guards were watching outside.</p>

<p>Far Away By Yu Saif</p>
<p>Mother poked her head out of the window and said:</p>
<p>"Be careful of your health!"</p>
<p>I nodded and walked away hastily, stepping on the shadows of the December clouds.</p>
<p>My younger brother watched me at the door. We parted silently. When I looked back, I could no longer see the door of home. All I saw were light yellow buildings, red roofs. Lively white clouds bloomed like flowers in the blue sky.</p>
<p>Last night, outside the door of a friend's house, the turbid shouts, the sound of handcuffs, the black car without notice... these gave me such a shock; in the morning, I knew he was missing, and now, I...</p>
<p>I have to start exile.</p>
<p>The whistle roared. The sailors untied the mooring ropes, and the dockworkers jumped from the ship to the dock one after another. They were crowded, they shouted, they seemed to be watching something. Thin smoke came out of the chimney. The whistle roared!</p>
<p>Quickly carrying two suitcases, I squeezed into the crowd. The ship had already left the dock by about a foot. I jumped into the cabin and ran to the deck so hastily, just to see the faces of my father and sisters again...</p>
<p>Father arched his shoulders, turning his entire old face towards me. Then, he removed his felt hat, and his gray hair seemed to be replacing his painful blessings. My sisters lowered their faces and no longer smiled foolishly at me.</p>
<p>I took out a handkerchief and waved to them, and even forced a smile. Father waved his felt hat…</p>
<p>What should I say to them?</p>
<p>This noisy sound, and the whistle roared again and again, the machines, the waves, and the wind, all hindered my shouts.</p>
<p>What should I shout to them?</p>
<p>Finally, people were small, scenery was small, and everything became a white fog. From then on, I left them. When the ship sailed out of the Wusongkou, I saw the sun opening its bloody mouth sadly in the twilight... That flag was inserted on the roof.</p>
<p>"There will be such a day..."</p>
<p>So, in my mind, a picture floated up of Japanese warships with the sun flag all being sunk in the sea.</p>
<p>I sat in the cabin, facing the surging dark green sea. The sky was gradually getting dark, and the sea was so wide that it was terrifying. The wind, freely and wildly, rushed across this turbulent wilderness. It howled, swallowing the smoke coming out of the chimney.</p>
<p>The lights came on, and soon, suddenly the whistle roared again.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>The passengers realized the ship was in trouble, and everyone opened their eyes wide, thinking about bad things.</p>
<p>"The inspection is coming..."</p>
<p>The cabin was in chaos. I opened my suitcase and gave the two notebooks I brought with me to the sea. I felt uncomfortable and covered the box.</p>
<p>Soon, two or three groups of five or six soldiers each rummaged between us. They didn't speak, and the cabin was filled with dead silence. ... The next day, I learned that nine Chinese people had been arrested in this search.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Between Brothers By Zeng Zhaojun <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese cavalry was stationed in Ju County, the market has been as dead as a graveyard. A large group of old people who had been conquered by the nation had moist eyes and were very sad. Most of the old people shook their heads and sighed, lamenting the demise of the world and the degeneration of people's hearts, which is why there is such a cruel retribution; what about the young people? They are unwilling to be obedient people or slaves. Their bright pupils radiate extraordinary light, staring fiercely into the distance, as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>In a bungalow not far from the market that had not been destroyed by artillery fire, lived two brothers, thirty-two-year-old Da Zhang; twenty-seven-year-old Xiao Zhang. The two people's faces looked very similar: white faces, slender eyebrows, almost even their toenails were the same. If it weren't for Da Zhang's left ear having a gold earring that was half a tael in weight, even their mother sleeping in the coffin would probably have a hard time telling them apart. Speaking of Da Zhang, he is really a young moralist. He wears horse pants with tight trouser legs all year round, and a small calligraphy brush is inserted in the small pocket on his chest. He has been studying at the university for seven years and still hasn't obtained a bachelor's degree. His actions and words are as slow as each other, slow and careful for fear of making mistakes. However, he has one commendable point, which is that the four characters "benevolence and concession can be admired". He is always willing to take a step back in everything and is full of the spirit of sacrifice. He is able to help others and sacrifice himself. Speaking of Xiao Zhang, he only has one thing in common with Da Zhang, which is "they are both willing to sacrifice." Everything else is completely different. Xiao Zhang's thoughts are very fresh and capable, and he always puts on the posture of a "leader." At school, he beat the principal and tied up the teachers. In society, he has been challenging evil forces. They are a pair of very good brothers who never argue, but since Ju County became an occupied area, when the enemy's "heroic" (?) posture was flaunted in Ju County, Xiao Zhang changed.</p>
<p>When eating, Xiao Zhang often deliberately broke bowls, saying that this dish was not good, that dish was too bad, and the coarse rice was even more inedible. He really couldn't stay here any longer. He wanted to divide the family. He also said that his father said before his death that half of the land would be divided among him, and Da Zhang should settle it immediately and go their separate ways. Da Zhang saw his beloved younger brother suddenly become another person and felt very strange, but he admitted that anything was possible. He didn't think carefully about the reason for his brother's "change". He listened carefully to Xiao Zhang's lion-like roar until Xiao Zhang's anger subsided, and then he slowly said: "Fourth brother, why do you want to talk about dividing the family? You can take as much as you want. How can you rob me... When father was dying…" When he said this, tears rolled from the tip of his nose onto his ancient duck feet.</p>
<p>The night of March 15th was a night with a full moon. The earth was covered with a layer of silver light, which made people truly feel that "the scenery is still the same". Xiao Zhang came back bathed in the moonlight, wearing an overcoat. It was Da Zhang who greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Fourth brother, look at such a good moonlight, it is a sign of brotherly reunion. Let's have a drink."</p>
<p>"Brother," Xiao Zhang's voice trembled a little, seemingly moved, "Now is not the time for us to reunite and drink. I advise you to divide the family with me immediately, otherwise it will be very unfavorable to you!"</p>
<p>"Otherwise, it will be very unfavorable to you!" Da Zhang didn't sleep all night, slowly thinking about his brother's words. By the time the east turned white, he seemed to have suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>"Fourth brother must be going to do something unruly. He is afraid of implicating me, so... so he wants to 'divide the family'!" Da Zhang said to himself. He wanted to find Xiao Zhang, but he searched all over the county and couldn't find Xiao Zhang's trace.</p>
<p>On the evening of the eighteenth, floating clouds covered the moonlight. Our guerrilla team launched an attack. The fire from the gun muzzles illuminated the sky red. The sparse stars looked like drunkards' faces. They first attacked the stables and killed all the horses. Without horses, the enemy's cavalry lost most of its combat power, and each one became material for making ashes. By the time reinforcements arrived, the guerrillas had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>In the square, a man in his thirties was tied up, with a white face and slender eyebrows. A "two-tael-heavy" earring hung on his left ear, and the small calligraphy brush was still inserted in the small pocket on his chest. It is said that this is the leader of the guerrillas, whose name is called "Xiao Zhang, Xiao Zhang!"</p>
<h3 id="e16">Good News from the Education Sector <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Teachers' Day, and the education sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon held enthusiastic celebrations in three locations. There are two particularly gratifying points worth reporting.</p>
<p>Firstly, over fifty schools in the Kowloon area held a solemn oath-taking ceremony for the National Covenant. For the first time, they united under the flag of the motherland, swearing absolute support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership and vowing to serve the country with all their might. It is hoped that everyone will encourage each other to earnestly put this into practice. Not only will it aid the national salvation effort today, but its benefits to the nation and society in the future will be immeasurable!</p>
<p>Secondly, during the Kowloon Education Festival, under the solemn leadership of Councilor Zhang Yijun, a significant proposal was passed: to send a message of appreciation and respect to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to convene a national monthly meeting, and to strengthen the unity of the education sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon, etc. This is a great declaration from the education sector, a milestone for the education sector in undertaking new tasks and implementing a new life!</p>
<h3 id="e17">Moving Speech <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>During yesterday's Hong Kong district assembly commemorating Teachers' Day, Mr. Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press, delivered a speech that moved everyone present. Mr. Wang advocated that future education should primarily cultivate good citizens for the nation, not just good children for the family. This point directly addresses the shortcomings of certain ××××× education currently. We hope not only that the education sector will pay attention to this, but that enlightened parents should also patiently and earnestly persuade the general fathers and elder brothers. We must also recognize that in this era, children who only care about their own personal wealth and safety are certainly not good children, while those who can be good citizens for the country, because they can focus on the big picture and consider the long-term interests of future generations, are certainly true good children!</p>
<p>Mr. Wang then pointed out that future education should not only focus on students' knowledge, but also on their life and cultivation outside of the curriculum; and that it should encourage students' autonomous and proactive learning. These two points are extremely important instructions for current education. It is hoped that teachers, students, and their parents will work together to guide them, not only encouraging students to participate in legitimate patriotic and social movements, but also encouraging students to seek self-study and cultivation through seminars and gatherings. The new era requires new talents, and even more so, new education! May everyone strive hard!</p>
<h3 id="e18">Shanghai Pudong Lun Chang Factory Incident: British National Fighting with Japanese Soldiers; × Soldiers Exceeding Authority to Interfere in Factory Disputes; Staff Members Stepped Forward to Stop It and Were Arrested <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 6th] A serious incident occurred in Pudong this morning. A British staff member of the British-owned Lun Chang Factory, Mr. Dingkler, was injured by Japanese soldiers and placed under "protective detention." A Japanese naval spokesman met with reporters this afternoon and stated that "the incident occurred due to a fight between striking workers and those opposing the strike at the Lun Chang Factory. Japanese naval forces intervened in this riot and dispersed the rioting workers. The British staff member of the company approached the Japanese sailors, demanding to handle the matter themselves. After the Japanese sailors refused, they fought with the Japanese sailors, attempting to remove the Japanese sailors' rifles. Dingkler fired at a certain sailor and snatched the weapon of another Japanese officer, forcing the officer to leave. He then repeatedly pointed the rifle at the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Pudong, insulting him and attempting to harm him. Dingkler was eventually disarmed, but he continued to attempt to strike, so his head was struck by a Japanese sailor," he said.</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 6th] Chinese workers at the Lun Chang Factory in Pudong have gone on strike. British staff member Dingkler and a Japanese officer were injured. However, British authorities are currently unaware of the exact situation. Dingkler is currently in a Japanese hospital in Pudong, and British officials are not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] According to news from outside Shanghai, Mr. Dingkler, a British staff member of the British-owned Lun Chang Company in Pudong, was arrested by the Japanese today. According to the Japanese, Ding had shot at a certain Japanese officer with a pistol and threatened two other Japanese officers with a gun. According to another source, Chinese workers at the Lun Chang Company clashed with British staff members again yesterday. Japanese troops attempted to maintain order and therefore opened fire. Dingkler and one Japanese officer were injured. Ding is now being sent to the Japanese hospital in Pudong by the Japanese troops, and British personnel are not allowed to meet with him. As for the true situation of the incident, the British side has not yet determined it.</p>
<p>× Consul Protests to Britain</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 6th] The Japanese Consul-General here visited the British Consul-General this afternoon and lodged a strong protest regarding the Dingkler incident, reserving the right to make demands.</p>

<h3 id="e20">British Study of Soviet Reply: No Concrete Decision; Officials Deny Negotiations Are About to Break Down; House of Commons Suggests Chamberlain Appoint Envoy to Soviet Union <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, 6th] According to reliable sources, the British Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee has further studied the recent proposals put forward by Moscow and concluded that a number of the proposals cannot be accepted. It is heard that the Soviet Union's demand that Britain and France guarantee the integrity of Estonia, Finland, and Latvia has been opposed by the committee, so the conclusion of the alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union cannot but be delayed. However, rumors that the negotiations for the alliance between the three countries are about to break down have been denied by officials. A spokesman for the British government also said that the British government does not wish to disregard the wishes of the Baltic countries or rashly go to war without their consent to protect the independence of those countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 5th] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain was asked whether he would consider making a formal visit to Moscow in person. Chamberlain replied that at the present stage, he did not see that the above suggestion would be of any use. When asked whether he felt that a personal visit to the Soviet Union would be sufficient to clear up "any obstacles or unpleasant phenomena between Britain and the Soviet Union," Chamberlain did not answer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 5th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Chamberlain. The committee immediately studied the Soviet reply on the issue of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and considered how Britain should respond, but no concrete decision was made.</p>
<p>Soviet Sources in London Know the Contents of the Soviet Reply</p>
<p>According to Soviet sources here, the contents of the Soviet reply were to review the drafts of Britain and France article by article, either accepting them directly or making amendments. There are three most important amendments: (1) The British and French drafts mentioned the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, in order to establish the alliance and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. "The Soviet Union now suggests amending the clause as follows": Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, wishing to promote the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, have made an agreement. If so, Article 16 of the Covenant "namely, the clause on sanctions against aggressor countries, which stipulates that sanctions can only be implemented after the League of Nations Administrative Council has unanimously approved them," need not be invoked further. (2) The British and French drafts advocated that the signatory countries should consult each other. The Soviet Union believes that it is acceptable to maintain a consultation mechanism when there is no war crisis. If such a crisis occurs, action should be taken immediately, and the method should be specified in advance. (3) The British and French drafts advocated that each country should mutually guarantee each signatory country. If one of the signatory countries is invaded and requests assistance from one of the signatory countries, assistance should be given immediately. The Soviet Union believes that Finland, Latvia, and Estonia should also be guaranteed, and the names of these countries should be specified in the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Informed sources here recently stated that the British cabinet is willing to find ways to resolve the first two points. However, as for the third point, the Baltic countries do not want to accept the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This attitude cannot be ignored. At the same time, the current state of this corner of Europe must be maintained. Considering all aspects, it is extremely difficult. Generally, Britain will first conduct talks with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels in the hope of finding new ways to ensure that all relevant countries can adopt them in principle, and then formally propose new suggestions to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[Associated Press London, 6th] A dispatch received here today from Tokyo states that Japan is unwilling to take on more obligations in Europe unless the Soviet Union is also involved. At the same time, it is heard that Japanese warlords are still trying to bring Japan closer to Germany and Italy. It is also heard that Arisue, the Japanese military attaché in Italy, who is known as a fervent supporter of the "Axis" policy, is planning to return to Japan soon. After arriving in Japan, he will fully promote activities related to the conclusion of a "Japanese-German military alliance," because an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is about to be established. Kawabe, the Japanese military attaché in Germany, may travel to London with Arisue to consult with Kiyonami, the military attaché in Britain.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Berlin, 5th] Official news has been released that Germany has separately negotiated non-aggression pacts with Latvia and Estonia.
