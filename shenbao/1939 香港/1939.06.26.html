<h3 id="c1">中蘇法新約與國際反略高潮 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>正苦於德意日本侵略考投機冒險瘋狂赫詐的戰火亂飛之際，正苦於侵略者及其鷹犬之造謠誣　挑撥　間的毒焰高漲之際，中蘇中法新約成立的消息，正像撥陰雲而瞭靑天，給我們帶來了無限欣慰無限興奮的情緒！</p>
<p>首先，中蘇通商條約之於本月十六日在莫斯科簽字，及中法新貸款協定之在本月廿二日成立，充分表現了我國兩年來反對和平妥協，堅持團結統一，英勇進行抗戰，已經更進一步的鞏固及提高我在國際的威信；充分表現了科會主義的蘇聯及民主和平國家的法國，他們對我國政府及人民的信賴與友誼，巳有更進一步的發展；更充分表現了一切愛護民主與和平的國家，對於日本侵略×的義憤與仇恨，證明了推進遠東反侵略陣線建立集體安全制度的必要與可能。我們今日不僅應該保持並增進對蘇法兩國的友善與互助關係，我們還要加倍努力發展展和一切民主和平國家尤其是英美兩國的友善與互助關係，只有中英美法和蘇聯的密切聯合，才能澈底消滅二次世界大戰的危機，保障人類文化進步！</p>
<p>其次，英法遠東軍事合作的新加坡會議，現已决定而經公開發表的，巳有「海軍以護航辦法保障商艦，印度空軍補充新加坡及集中軍事原料與供養」等項，尤其值得注意的，是自從日本侵略　於去年五月强佔厦門，去年十月强佔廣州，今年二月　佔海南島，三月强佔新南羣島，五月在鼓浪嶼登陸，六月封鎖天津租界及日前强佔汕頭以來，遠東戰火已有燃遍裏外南洋以至全太平洋的危險，而英法此次新加坡會議，便在討論合作防衛日本侵略的具體辦法，因此這次會議又可視爲建立遠東反侵略陣線保隙集體安全制度的發端，其意義自然　十分重大。</p>
<p>第三，　論歐洲或遠東，一切防制侵略保衛和平的運動都不能不有美洲最大民主和平國家之美國的參加。力其是美國與英國友誼關係的增進。這在遠東問題，尤或迫切與重要。而消息之足以令人欣慰與興奮者，卽英美兩國友誼關係，確已有前未曾見的敦睦！其間最可注目老爲太平洋上兩小島問題，兩國均能互相讓步，得以解决，繼之最近英王夫婦聘問北美合衆　，獲得全美官民一致熱烈的歡迎，並且奠定了歐美兩大民主國家合作反抗侵略保衛民主與和平的基礎，日來美總統羅斯福聘問英倫之聲甚高，而英美兩國的物物交換協定，亦已於本月廿三日正式簽字，卽此次天津事件，英國雖仍隱忍退讓，美國則仗義執言，一再向日抗議，而英法新加坡會議，雖無美國參加，但事實上再三聲述決與美蘇保持密切聯系。我們相信今後英美友善關係，必有更畏足的進步。</p>
<p>此外，是法土兩國互助協定，已於本月卅三日在巴黎簽字，從地理上和軍事說，這一協定對於安定地中海和近東風波，是有重大意義的，從政治上說，自然大有助歐洲反侵略陣線的積極發展。同時羅馬尼亞外長加芬科，以巴爾幹協商國主席的資格，最近分訪土京及稚典後，已在草擬新巴爾幹聯防公約，準備擴大羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，土耳其及希臘等協商國的義務，互相簽證，如遇任何方面侵犯，卽彼此互相援助。這一運動，對於防禦正向南國誘脅的德意侵略者，及保持東南歐與近東集體安全，也有電大意義的。</p>
<p>目前最爲使人焦灼不安的，就只有一波三折的英法蘇三國互助協定的談判。而這一談判，又正是對於一切國際和平反侵略，集體安全連動具有决定的意義的談判。這一談判的所以一波三折迄無成就，主要原因，端在英國政府，　　　　　　　　　既因德意日三國之步步進逼而不得不借重蘇聯以示反抗，又唯恐幻想之『布爾什維克的侵入』而希圖預爲德意日本侵略政策留一出路。但目前蘇聯既堅持立場，務求切實普遍的集體安全制度之建立，而英法國內廣大人民與多數政界領袖亦一致督促政府切實聯絡蘇聯，加以侵略者的步步進逼日益迫使英法忍無可忍，英法蘇互助協定的簽訂，是不能或才會冉行遷延了。</p>
<p>國際反侵略運動的的新的高潮，是我們爭取勝利的主要的有利條件之一，我們要緊緊抓住，努力推進，同時加緊團結，堅持抗戰，在反侵運動的最前線，爲本國獨立與爲世，和平事業而奮鬥。</p>

<p>— 簡任芬</p>
<p>（本報特稿）在『抗日高於一切，一切服從抗』的口號下，我們四十個活躍的靑年同志，爲挽救垂危的祖國與寧取人　的正義和平，××××更不願在這　靡　華的象牙宮　一般地過着昇平逸豫的生活而眼　着祖國的淪亡，與廣大向砲吾×人殘酷底　　下過着慘無天日的生活。因此。我們毅然堅决　拋　了一切，代表全港十萬同學，囘到祖國　大的鬥爭場面，幹　刻苦而有意義的工作。到今天已　五個月了，我們這次歸國服　。爲要加強我們工作的技能和政治軍事的知識，便先到省府西江行署去參加　期的集訓，所以任工作上我們不　說對國家民族有多大的貢獻但我們在這　速的過程中，已經作了四于參里的　　，踏過了廣東的從着和多少崇山　　，渡過了幾許　　小溪署宿在路旁山下，在坍塌的廟堂和局促而　葬加角、冷</p>
<p>為了救亡的心切，在烈日下，在風　中　在　　猛　狂炸下，更不知受盡了多少的辛勞和艱苦，　去所　公子　　的戰懸和　　和　　小組的風度與小　產階級　由　漫的劣根性早已在我們　意議的　團生活裏嶺偉大鬥爭時代的容顏中改變了，更經過幾個月來艱苦的　練，每個　的都成了堅韌舉决的鬥士，我們　透　不到　在西千多　的長征中，能　　然　　轉到　　江　沒有一個戰士生病和落伍的，這是一件萬分僥倖的事。</p>
<p>在這流動的旅途上，沒有許多固定的時間給我們好好地開展工作，但是我們却沒有放鬆一刻的光陰而不去進行我們的任務，同時在這四千餘里的過程中，我們明瞭內地當前的情形；與所得到的不少安慰，這一方面足以鼓起我們向上的勇氣，另一方向更可以警惕我們今後有加緊工作的必要。</p>
<p>在這裏因爲時間關係我們祗能把五個月的情形作簡略的報吿。</p>
<p>（一）香港到廣寧</p>
<p>元月十三日的下午我們離開香港，從漢門乘　關車到中山，十七日到江門，十九日和西江行署政治大隊的一百多個學員，繼續未竟的路程。</p>
<p>從江門出發經過　山　坪，沿途公路　已自動破壞，我們祗得安步當車，抵達沙坪時已深夜、就在縣立中學過了一宵，那時空氣十分緊張距離前綫不過十多里，×人不時向沙坪發炮，但多數　在荒郊，然而最令人興奮的是各方面都呈現着非常時期的狀態。這對於今日鶴山新會一帶的戰績，實有很大的關係。</p>
<p>從沙坪到高明大約是九十華里，我們以一天的行程，在二十號晚上便到達了，因爲初次長扯，同志們感覺得疲倦，於是决定在高明小學休息了一天，我們就籍此在縣城東南門外，開一個民衆大會，那時高城因爲頗受敵機慘酷的轟炸，已經變成了一個寂靜的死城了，然而經我們許多同志努力的號召，更得到當地各機關團體的帶助，結果參加的民衆與附近鄉村的自衛團，總有千人以上，熱烈極了，情緒的高張，使我們感到萬分的興奮，同時也是囘到祖國後第一次得到的安慰。</p>
<p>元月廿一日，在晨光微的時候，我們便離開高明向肇慶進發，當我們的隊伍離開高城不遠，十八架二機從東面以最快的速度趕來，一到縣城上空，盤旋了一週，在縣城東南門外擲下數十个百磅重的彈炸，我們蟄伏在草原上終於　免這一次的災難，待×機去後，我們　同志踴　地，爭先恐後跑回災區　，撿救那些無辜遭害的同胞，因此在高明又多逗留了一天。</p>
<p>為了趕程到祿步和避免空襲的麻煩，我們便星夜離開肇　，廿二日到達祿步，廿三日到水口，大約平均每大走六十至七十華里，經過許多窮鄉僻壞廿八日便到達廣寧縣屬的賓抗，這是一個小小的墟場，我們在　裏休息兩天，便利用這兩天的機會，推動同行的一百多個政治大隊的同學，組織臨時歌劇隊，標語隊，漫畫隊，演講隊……等配合我們分頭到各村鄉去進行廣範的宣傳工作，同時應當地抗日先鋒隊同志之請，便招集　地的靑年和民衆開了個座談會，討論各項民連問題，幷由我們担任時事報吿。在這兩天的工作，我們不敢說得到很好的效果，但是我們香港隊（各方對我們的稱呼）在整個賓坑已爲一般羣衆　深切的認識了，</p>
<p>元月三十一日我們一口氣在猛烈的陽光底下，走了一百二十華里，在深夜九時左右便到達廣寧下，習日卽入營訓練，從此我們便開始軍事政治的　習</p>
<p>（二）在集訓時期</p>
<p>我們的集訓地點距離廣寧縣城三上多里，是在僻靜的山谷中，茂綠的森林，蒼翠的靑山，碧綠的巖石，澄淸的溪水，人在其間，彷彿進了蓬萊之境。當每天大淸早晨，大陽還沒有　出了面，起床號響了，幾百個活躍的靑年神速地集合在朝霧籠罩着的遼闊的廣場上，開始早會和晨操，那時西江二月的天氣，實在冷得可怕，我們祇穿上一件飄薄的棉襖。物質的缺乏眞使人預想不到，一切設備都異常簡陋，課堂是設在大自然界的懷抱裏每飱所吃的沒油的老菜，和半沙半　的組米，可惜在這時期每天除了數小時的術科外，其餘學課的訓練簡直是沒有什麼可增益的地方。然而，學員爲着要準備將來的鬥爭任務，一切思想上　理論上是急切需要充實起來的，所以大家都很技　地。或躱在樹林裏或者慝在寢室中，來偷讀的書報，大家仍然是盡可能地積極作向開展作的準備</p>
<p>這樣在訓練期中的生活，苦是苦極了，然而我們總」心不了歸國的初衷，更忘不了所負的使命，每個同志都是一樣的在刻苦鬥爭中學習着。</p>
<p>到了三月終旬，西江行署撤消了，我們究竟怎樣呢？我們就在徬徨中隨二百多個同學　蹈上二次的征途——從西江向北江進發。</p>
<p>（三）西江到北江</p>
<p>我們爲着找　眞正的抗日工作，由西江到北江，經過淸遠陽山乳源三縣，全程約一千八百餘里，整　的行了廿八天。戰友們背負着沉重的背囊，和光亮的刀槍，經過淸遠的九曲山和陽山的飛鵝嶺，山道迂迥崎嶇，峭如壁立，企斜的羊腸小道，千轉萬曲，己屬難行，加以整個山中沒有一點水，渴得口快要干焦了在熱烈的陽光下，上坡下坡，其困難頗似渡沙漠　艱苦，地形的險惡一，誰也料想不到，我們除了在半山歇息以外，足足走了三十二小時才到達中原地帶，我們在北市，在江屯，在　坑……每經過一個地方，都必做下一番宣傳工作，到了陽山乳源之間，這一帶的文化比較落後，雖有二救亡團體的組織，但民衆工作做得不好，一般老百姓還不明瞭　民合作的重要性，所以一部份羣衆對於我們，簡直像對過去軍閥一樣的看待，當我們的隊伍還沒有到達，他們便跑光了，或是緊閉　　，工作的食粮到此便成了問題。因此經過的軍隊沒有不感到　養和運輸的困難，一小部份政政水準低落的軍隊、經過這些地方，不免要用高壓的手段來滿足他們的　求，這樣軍　之　的惡感，便更深刻化了，我們對於這些缺點，是負日相當責任的，於是我們便決定脫離了大隊，特地抽出十多天的光景，在陽山縣屬的秤架進行我們的工作，因爲秤架是二期抗戰後韶連交通必經的要道，同時也是將來最適宜的游擊根據地。</p>
<p>我們在秤架工作，首先是經過一番技術的宣傳，博得一般人信仰以後，便推動當地較有聲望的士紳和利用　有的團體，成立一個軍民同樂會，會內的組織是分服務組織財政交通各部，同時還設有書報室及各種有意義的娛樂如體育象棋：等，每部的幹事鄱是由地方選出的，這不僅使軍民方面得到聯絡，同時以後過境的團隊，需要粮食，或倔請挑佚，可以直接向該會交涉。此外還發動一般較前進的靑年和當地得一般人信仰的小學教師，在附近各村　，舉辦戰時學校（包括婦女識字班和成人班，結果總算有　收獲，在短短的半個月時間，由於同學們的努力一切進行那很順利，巳經成立的戰時小學已經有了七間，還有五間是在籌備中的，可惜時間不許我們在那裏多逗留，當我們要離開抨舉起手帕揚別的時候，羣衆們的　上表現依戀不捨的神態，這正是我們團結一致認請×人的表示，同時也是呈現着偉大的民族革命的活素。</p>
<p>到了四月初旬，我們便到達曲江龍歸，那總算達到我們的目的地了。在　時期我們一方面等候香港　賑會的指示，一方面在龍歸一帶配合四戰區的政工隊作廣　的民衆運動同時加緊自我教育和　格的鍛鍊。到了五月中旬，我們爲着　　抗戰環境的要求，便派了一部份同學到淪陷區工作其餘二十多個同學，在最近繼續經過三百多里的長征，又跑到翁源五華重受軍事的集訓，這里離前綫愈加接近了，我在六月終便要紙到前綫去，參加直接的軍隊工作，到這裏我們可算暫吿一個　落。</p>

<p>— ……張常人……</p>
<p>高地雖然只有××多公尺的　　，而且　灌灌的　山；却是××鎮南方的唯一障，實為兩軍必爭之地，北軍在此地築　堅固陳地：高地下是一片沼澤，這　地的前後方佈有鐵絲網三道，地雷若干；兩翼各配　輕　機關槍×挺、高地後方並　備迫迫砲若干；可以構成緊密的火網。所以南軍雖動度猛攻，却蒙受極大的犧牲而退，是夜，繼續加强工事，補充彈藥，以防萬一。</p>
<p>南軍爲欲達成速戰速决目的，澈夜運動，準備於第二日淸晨，對×××高地以總攻姿態佔領之。</p>
<p>翌日拂　，天空中吹着輕緩的東南風。南軍的化學兵穿戴着白色面具和象皮衣服，潛近北軍左翼陣地，躱進死角下面去。不久，幾個發烟筒燒着了，濃白的　一縷縱地隨風向北軍陣地揚開，其他的化學兵則在較遠的低處，握着發烟筒往來奔跑着，北軍一面發出南軍施放　幕的信號，一面集中火力，射擊動作中的南軍化學兵，但被對方以更高的火力壓制、致終歸無效。××分　後，一重冪冪的烟幕已覆蓋在×××高地的上面，南軍陳地，如入五里霧中。這時，南軍工兵卽實施爆破×××高地前的防禦工事，而大隊的戰車和步兵，也開始在烟幕後出動。</p>
<p>南軍的戰車爲防中央突波、恐受北軍戰車防禦砲或地雷等的轟擊，以從隊由具右翼猛襲北軍左翼。輕捷低矮的坦克很迅速就突波了北軍陣地的一角。該方第一綫的守兵立卽向兩側散開，紛紛以手留單（石塊）對戰車猛攻。輕州克車的衝鋒雖略受頓挫；但南軍的戰車　，××頓××式電戰車數十輛却改換橫隊，響着十萬匹馬力的引擎，繼續掩護步兵，動地而來。無限軌　輾過了山溝，壓斷了樹不，衝波了鐵絲網……。幾乎吏擊個戰塲變了樣。得戰車上的×××砲不斷地轟擊着，機關槍也乎　着在吐着火舌，猛烈掃射着抵抗中的北軍。十分鐘後，北軍左翼因犧牲過重，且戰且退。南軍戰車中的無綫電收報員接獲指揮官的電令，恢復原來的隊形，通過××山道，迂迥×××高地後方，追擊前進，企圖一舉突破北軍的主陳地帶。</p>
<p>北軍從深陣地的完密，　出南軍意料之外。戰車防禦砲於南軍戰事一進入有效射程、卽以穿甲彈猛射。第一輛坦克（木製）皀起火，後續戰車有一輛陷入北軍預設的一平行抗」，進退兩難，車中的駕駛兵射擊手都携槍出車，陷於苦戰，另一輛因趨避步機槍的密集射擊（實彈），中地雷，機件捐壞被俘。南軍戰車隊受此損失、攻勢頓挫；步兵　氣全失，普遍地呈現畏縮不前之象。</p>
<p>北軍主官接得前方的確實報吿後，决定斷然施行逆襲。下令偽裝進入陣地之輕重戰車×××輛，協同第二線步兵對突破陣地的南軍反攻。這時，南軍的左翼正以一×兵力進行爭奪×××高地右後方的另一高地，北軍情況，至臻一髪千鈞之境。當卽最先發生慘烈的白　戰、兩軍都上刺刀（木槍）衝殺，吶喊之聲震動四野、該方南軍因後援不繼，終至全　。</p>
<p>北軍的戰車，在數量上雖僅及南軍的四分之一，但因戰意的　郁，戰車與步兵的逆襲協定非常　滿，與恃戰車為堡壘，視步兵若累質的南軍作戰，終竟以少制多，長驅南下。經過四小時的逆襲戰鬥，北軍便恢復了當日拂曉以前的原有陳地。</p>
<p>「攻擊爲最好的防禦」北軍以南軍新收，决意予打擊者以打擊，殲滅敵人於本軍的陣前，遠在××鎮以北的北軍砲兵，遂開始以××生的重砲對南軍施行殲滅射擊。這新銳的武器，使南軍的各兵種無法應戰，紛紛潰退。在觀測所北軍砲兵×長於是復下令延伸　離，與戰車步兵協作追擊。</p>
<p>明月再到中天，北軍逆襲成功。南軍脫　戰。在曳光彈的火　構成演習中，紅綠色的光器綱狀地覆罩着×××高地前提演習場，觀操大員以及每一個參加演習的將校和士兵，都由衷地發出一種美麗和悅的心情。每個人都確信：中國的軍隊己經現代化了，他已有雄厚力　予打擊者以打擊。殲滅敵人於本軍的陣前！一九三九，六，一〇，在桂林。</p>

<p>【民革社能訊稿】日×在山西作戰的一般戰略，自去年底以來。卽改變爲「由綫變面，逐漸拓大」的新的戰略，以同蒲路爲基幹。向左右逐漸　食的侵略，這是日×自知不能整個「掃蕩』山西的鐵證。</p>
<p>浮山安澤兩縣，其西部毗連洪起臨汾等縣，地形平坦，爲山西有數之平原，×寇爲鞏固洪洞臨汾的佔領，減少我方不時襲擊的威脅，必須進一步，奪佔了兩縣的西部，這釜×寇進攻浮山的　因。</p>
<p>×寇一再的圍攻我晉東南根據地，雖然因受了極大的打擊而一再的失收，但其『掃蕩」的企圖，却從沒有放棄，只不過戰略上有了改　而已，它企圖從根據地的外圍，抓取若千重要據點，漸次壓迫，漸次縮小我根據地的活動範圍，這是×寇進攻浮山的另一企圖。</p>
<p>奪佔浮山後，進一步越過太岳山脈，卽可進攻上黨，同時北上可進犯安澤南下可以威脅沁水，這是×寇的最後企圖，我們爲了保衛晉東南根據地，在戰略上無論怎樣不能忽視了太岳山脈一帶高地，在軍事上的重要性，「寧可放棄縣城，不能失掉東山』。戰事未發，我卽將城內民衆，靑年壯丁，紳商耆老等完全移居到東山一帶，一則因縣城無死守必要，一則爲了避免民衆的無理犧牲，這樣，給予×人一個空洞的城　，兩月來，連組織維持會的人才都物色不到，還有什麼收獲呢？</p>
<p>×寇在在二月十七日開始進攻，却正當舊曆除夕的那幾天，×寇滿以爲抓住這絕妙良機，可以逞所欲爲了，却不想這是什麼時候，這時我軍事的部署是這樣的：在曲邊與西北方面接近　洞的臨汾的地方，由我獨　旅某某團及本縣游擊大隊防守，主要兵力駐在南北韓村一帶（城西廿餘里），在南邊及　南方面接連臨汾翼城方面的地方，爲口口總隊防守。主要兵力另一部，駐臨汾浮山交界……隊塞在南畔橋一帶，城南廿九里（西南卅餘里），城東四十里嶺（沿東山一帶）爲決×隊×團配備防守，主力於嶺東三交村左右（城東五十里）</p>
<p>這是針　着×寇的「怎樣進攻」而預料的部署的，同時事實也證明了這個預料的無誤。×寇分兩路開始進犯，一路由臨汾東犯大陽，官雀一帶，一路山　城北上，再分三股，進犯鄢裏南畔橋，兩路步騎炮聯合兵力達三千餘，附擊炮十餘，汽事四十餘輛，採分進合擊戰略直熱浮山。</p>
<p>由臨汾東犯××，决×轉入×後方，十七日上午與××旅，槍彈齊發，當晚侵入宜　，同時由翼城犯鄢裏×，開始接火，大炮機檢，以迂迴戰略侵入，我奮勇反攻，復向東南方面衝　×綫，阻住×人的前進，次日晨官　×復向韓村猛犯，以　軍機槍猛烈發射，我卽栘往城郊附近，同時鄢裏方面亦同樣撤囘，這　城內僅有的少數民衆，扶老携幼，各向　山逃避，我城內部隊不能立刻放棄縣城，先須掩護民衆的先引撤退，一日一夜間，幾度激戰，我×主軍拚死抵抗，會　少退一步，十九日拂曉，城內已『布置一空』，我方很出戰鬥，移東一帶。</p>
<p>我們一再說明，四十里嶺在地理上軍事上的重要，因而也成爲×寇企圖打通興奪佔最後的目標，三月初，×寇從臨　方面續增來步砲一千餘，作積極犯東山準備。我亦抽調沁水第×師××兩團前來增援，三日早我援兵大部進至四十里嶺東南，先頭一部已進到城東南五里的堯廟山。</p>
<p>最緊張，最激烈而關係最重的是三月九日的戰鬥。堯廟山之役後將近一週來、我×兩方均積　佈置。願拚最大的力量，爭此生死存亡的最後「關頭」，這是××團×士兵的豪語，所謂「關頭」卽指東山四十里嶺。</p>
<p>這是天氣陰沉太陽不見，淸晨的大霧還在迷漫着，×步騎五百餘一早就向城東二十里東要　，某某兩團猛攻過來，兩團健兒卽併力迎擊，斃×八十餘，激戰至十時，×分一路繞過董大橋「因橋被我破壞）企圖由山坡村直撲四十里嶺，當時我游支團，已全部佈置在嶺上，待×進至相當距離卽聞始猛烈射擊，未散盡的　霧阻碍着，兩方的明確視綫，只　管向炮聲槍聲的方向發射過去，相持三小時，我×團長眼看子彈卽將斷絕，突然馳赴前綫，高喊：「某營某連上　刀！前進！」一時殺！殺！之聲，滿震山谷，山坡上燃起了手溜彈的火花，×寇不知就里，只當有了援兵，却正驚疑起來！正面東南方向，陡然一陣槍聲緊緊迫來，×寇疲憊已極，不堪冉戰，紛紛向西方退竄，我軍勝利之後，才明白了原是××團前來助戰，他們歡然的計算敵×遺屍，共達百二十餘具。</p>
<p>浮山城在底頭看去，恰像我東山上大砲的一個標的；十七日晚我不時向城內發射，×人全部的連夜栘出城外，越過西關的大溝駐紮，這雖不是退出，却也是爲（避免我的威脅。</p>
<p>這是×寇進攻浮山一月來的狀况，他企圖奪佔的東山，不但始終未到手，却便因我積極的防守，不時的出　，與士兵的興奮，民衆的敵愾，愈成爲我堅强的堡壘，同時在軍事上已取得主動的地位與戰略，更能予×寇以極大的威脅，自三月底，至四月初間，×　雖也曾重整旗鼓再進攻東山幾次，但每次總是失敗，他的最後企圖，將永遠不能實現了吧！</p>

<p>本港霍亂蔓延益速，當局業經决定採取緊急處置，一面增加淸道伕二百人垃圾車五輛，並開放荔枝角傳染院收容病人，一面努力宣傳，灌輸居民以防疫知識爲了市民大衆安全，這是莫大的德政。不過僅此辦法，似仍有杯水車薪之感。為求其史切實澈底，一面應該動員報紙，學校及各界公團，擴大防疫宣傳，一面認眞檢査一切「平民化」的食料品，給予必要指導與實惠的協助，實現窮街陋巷的淸潔運動。當然，主要的還在設法救濟廣大貧苦居民，特別是抑低房租與物價，增闢平民謀生之路！一個社會上，如果繼續存在最大多數人的飢無食夜無宿病無醫的市民，則一切疫癘亦永無肅淸之日！因此，不得不有望於殷富者的慷慨解囊了。</p>

<p>我們看慣了那些動搖份子，頑固份子，心胸狹窄，自私自利不知國家社會的文人，一個個的在抗戰的熔爐前面，露出原形，跑到×人以至×人之鷹犬的門下去，無恥吠堯，狺狺不已，眞是悲憤交集，今日得聞祝先生之在惡勢力下堂堂『掛冠而去』，不僅自留淸白之身，並且　千萬有骨氣有熱腸的文人，吐氣揚眉使那般無恥之徒，見而愧死！</p>
<p>雖然，我們亦不能不在這裏嚴重指出：祝先生之『掛冠』是爲了避免無謂磨擦。增加抗戰建國的困難，但是祝先生之『掛冠』，同時亦暴露了在這抗戰進入新的艱苦階段之際，一切腐惡勢力，已　再度抬頭起來！因此祝先生的『掛冠』，其意義正在提高我們的警惕，加重我們的責任！</p>

<p>— 董平</p>
<p>同樣的，在意大利政治舞台的幕後，也有着一個舉足輕重的女人物，那便是莫索里尼的長女。齊亞諾的夫人愛達。這位愛達姑娘，在羅馬確有着相當的潛勢力，齊亞諾的前程是他一手提拔的，旣不用說：連莫索里尼常常言聽計從，相傳有一次莫索里尼在早上召開什麽會議，齊亞諾遲到了半小時，下午齊亞諾便收到了丈人送來的一句禮物。一打閙鐘，這當然使女婿挺難堪，但愛達姑娘立刻把這包禮物退了囘去，附了張條子，寫着：葛拉索昨晚伴我跳舞去的。第二天，丈人和女婿見面時，是一個會心的微笑。</p>
<p>張伯倫夫人便是愛達姑娘的密友，她和莫索里尼也有着相當的友誼。在羅馬她有着一所華美的別墅，一年三百六十日，一半以上是消磨在那兒的。每個週尾，那兒是羅馬外交官員們最能姿意尋歡的地方。</p>
<p>遠在她的亡夫未死之前，她已經在英意間作外交活動，一九三四年英法意奧的包圍德國斯得薩陣綫，鮑便拉攏甚力。到了去年的英意協定，更是她和愛達一手撮成的。張伯倫的一味醉心聯意，企圖去拆德意軸心的台，也便是他這位嫂夫人的主張。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>與張伯倫夫人具有同樣作風，甚至於，更煊嚇的，便是倫敦德萊侯爵。這位侯爵今年五十九歲，愛爾蘭的地主，十足的保守性；在英國政治舞台，具有着廣大的潛勢力。在倫敦西部，他有着一所寬宏的住宅，那兒已成了一般進身之階的龍門了。每年英國議會暑間休會終了，侯爵夫婦總在這所私邸中，大宴賓客，首相以下的官吏，都是參加的。這個宴會現在已成了測量侯爵勢力消長的風雨表了。</p>
<p>侯爵的宦海經驗，旣然異常豐　。最先是在愛爾蘭政府發跡，一九三一年，在叛黨麥唐納內閣中正式担任了航空大臣，麥唐納的轉向，也與侯爵有相當關聯的。麥唐納吿休，繼任的鮑爾温是相當的自由主義，跟這位侯爵可就不怎樣相投了；當他探悉了德國的第一線飛機，已到了四千架，生產率又比英國快一倍的時候他一怒便把侯爵撤職了。這樣，有兩年，一九三五與三六，侯爵的私邸中沒有宴會。</p>
<p>一九三七年，鮑爾温逼宮，愛德華八世遜位，鮑爾温也下台以謝國人。張伯倫的十足保守主義，又帶來了這位侯爵的好運。他現在是上議院的領袖兼掌璽大臣了。</p>
<p>倫教德萊侯爵雖有張伯倫夫人同樣的作風，但他幷不是親意，他是親德——意的與國侯。爵跟希特勒是否有怎據的交情，　不知道，但他和里賓特羅甫是有密切友誼的。遠在里氏還是希特勒顧問的時候，他們卽已訂交；後來里氏出使倫敦，更是每天消磨在侯爵的　邸中</p>
<p>在名義上，倫敦德萊侯爵還正式担任著一個叫「英德聯誼會」的會長。這個會的眞正任務，不大清楚，它的宗旨：「是推進英德兩國人民間的友誼與合作」。</p>
<p>這位侯爵，每年至少得上德國去「遊覽」一次。當去年秋間，希特勒進逼捷克最緊的時候，他是正自德國作了一次「私人訪問」囘來，向張伯倫報吿說：德國第一線飛機六千架，廿四小時之內，能把倫敦化爲廢墟。這還得了，張伯倫心里明白，只有移樽就敎，犧牲一點××的士地，是上策。</p>
<p>今年春天的捷克事變，張伯倫雖然口口聲聲說他事　毫無所聞，完全上了希特勒的當。但，老實的哈立法克斯却在上院中承認的，遠在三月十一日，捷克事變的前兩天，英政府已獲得德軍集中捷克邊境的情報了。自然，這情報又是倫敦德萊侯爵送到的。他的報吿的結論，恐怕還有這樣的兩句：德國第一綿飛機七千架，十二小時之內，能把倫敦化爲廢墟。這樣，自然，張伯倫便只有起草痛×流×的聲明的份兒了。</p>
<p>許多人是　倫敦德萊侯稱爲張伯倫的「星期五」的，其實，這是不够正　，「星期五」只不過是爲魯濱遜奔走的僕人，而這位侯則是影響張伯倫主張的人。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>張伯倫的「智囊」。還有許多，這里提出的張伯倫夫人與倫敦德萊侯爵便是其中的代表。他們的傾向，恰是與輿論相反，而把張伯倫向後拉，向右推的。</p>
<p>自然，我們很明白，張伯倫的政策，幷不是完全取决於這羣「智囊」；同樣地，我們也相信。張伯倫也幷不致於因這羣「智囊」的推動，便眞的走上了法西斯的道路。但，有這一羣「智囊」包圍在左右，要張伯倫去根絕綏靖政策，實在是很奢望的。因此，張伯倫才想了個好主意：來一個雙管齊下，一面跟希特勒商量，請他向東去，掀起「反共」戰爭；一面與史塔林「聯歡」，作嚇詐希特勒的後盾，這又叫做「半截政策」。</p>
<p>這說法，幷不是說現在的英蘇談判不會成功，如果，英國與世界的輿論再推動一下，蘇聯肯讓步一點，英蘇協定，是可以簽字的。但，有什麽用？唯利是圖的英國人，對條約的信守，已跟希特勒差不了多少的；尤其張伯倫先生，是擅於悔的法門的。四月里，張伯倫不是發表了英國對波保證的聲明嗎？現在呢？英國外部發言人說：「英國對但澤及走廊問題，聽波蘭自由處置，不加千涉。一這不很明白了，就是說：「希特勒先生，如果你能用點技巧，騙服了波蘭的話，我們也可以馬馬虎虎不聞不問的」。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形之下。我們希望張伯倫來建立反侵略陣線，制止侵略，實在是不可能。充其量，也不過是在展延侵略的爆發罷了。而張伯倫的命運，也已到達了　延的階段，不久的將來，終就可以見到他的沒落。</p>

<p>一個上海白俄義勇隊的隊員，叫特里福諾夫的，邀同了六個伙伴，乘着一艘帆船，「維斯拉號」，自上海出發，計劃橫渡太平洋，到荷蘭去。不幸，經過日本的時候，被日本憲兵請了去作客，受盡凌弄，下面是他的一封自白信：</p>
<p>我們的遊船，自上海出發的第四天，不拳，遇見了大風雨，船受了損傷；爲了要赶緊修理，我們不得不在台灣附近的靑山小島登岸。才上岸，立刻就有日本憲兵跑過來盤問，我們要求一個正駛過的汽艇，想把遊船拖進港裏去，他們全不置理，反將我們扣留起來，說我們是英美的間諜。我們連忙拿上海字林西報上剪下來的，遊船離滬出發時的新聞，送給他們看，那才是多此一舉！他們看過之後，頂起眼珠，說，四天之內航行了六百海里，眞是胡說八道！</p>
<p>從此，那艘裝置得挺講究的遊船，就不屬於我們管了，任令小販們，取船中一切的物品，以致所有的罐頭和全套炊具，都失去了，後來，我知道，連警察老爺們，也各人都飽飽地到手一份。</p>
<p>憲兵又迫令我們，把所有的美金，都換成日元。一塊美金，只　到兩枚日元，不久，就把我們都乾榨啦。於是又毫不猶豫地，處分我們的衣服，皮鞋，鐘錶，每樣物件，却也付個一枚日元到三枚日元不等的代價，直到我們弄得一無所有才　。一次下雨，可憐，警察竟沒有雨衣，來向我們「借」，自然，雨衣一去，是不復返了。「借」，似乎很通行，我們只要有東西，剛換幾個錢來，別愁沒有人來「借」。</p>
<p>在那里，徇了兩個月，受過幾次盤詰，臉上，也就挨過了幾次巴掌，拳頭。後來，當局决定，將我們解送到日本附近的那恰港，和日本囚徒，囚在一處。不分晝夜的，那些日本囚徒，會被叫出去，我們只能遙聞呼號的聲昔，據說，那是在審問。若果守衞的睡熟了、囚徒們，却又低唱若第三國際的歌曲，全窒都會響應起來</p>
<p>拘禁了四個月，當局不願意再養活我們了，因爲，我們已成了他們一種負担，這時，我們囊空如洗，只能打算出賣遊船，這船，四個月來，無人照料，螺絲的推動機已經壞了，馬達也完全不靈了。有誰要買呢，可是，我們又不能不動身。</p>
<p>在我們離日的前一星期，才容許寫信，我們同伴中，有一位是波蘭人，他將困苦情形，陳訴到駐東京的波蘭領事，請求救濟。這封信，經過査之又査，檢之又檢，然後，向我們說明，以前我們的「寄宿一費，和其他一切費用。都是日政府代　的，等收到波蘭領事的款項時，須如數歸還。</p>
<p>不久，波蘭領事來信，說所需多少，卽將照付。日當局得悉之下，連忙添判我們一個遊船擅入禁區的罪狀，繳罰日金三百元。同時，知道我們中，有三個人是賣藝的，就命令他們到戲院去表演，幾天下來，據我們推算，可以賺得三百多塊日元，但是，到付欵那天，結算下來，我們不但分文無着，反欠了戲院里二十九元的債，這就是說我們愈辛苦得久，債也會愈欠得多，眞是日本數法，我們每天，規定兩元伙食，可是，這些，只够買點甜薯，麵粉，和一點點脂　，要想點烟草，都不够開銷。</p>
<p>表演了幾大，只是使我們將僅存的一點衣物都喪失了。波蘭大使爲我們向日外務省交涉，日外務者，一口担承將我們的失物追還，可是，等我們囘到遊十船上一看，五桶水少了三桶，新置的杯，盤，壺，罐，和炊具，以及紀念册，又都不翼而飛了。</p>
<p>費了日金七十元，將遊船整理一下，幷沒有全修好，不過，使她能駛離這日本『天堂』罷了。</p>
<p>現在，天保佑，我們已經抵達菲列賓，預備往澳大利亞進航，菲列賓的人，不知什麽原故，使我們特別感覺得，個個都是彬彬有禮，和靄可親。</p>

<p>晉朝的陶淵明老先生，爲官不大得意，賦了一首「歸去來辭」之後，就退隱家園，以詩酒自娛，因爲想到『田園將蕪』，就在小園中種植一些桃樹，陶老先生，文章詩賦，固然冠絕一時，但是對於植物學，却沒有硏究，他眼看着對門道士　中的桃樹，十分茂盛，尤其在桃熟時送過來嘗嘗的挑子，鮮甜之外，裏面竟沒有核，這對於陶老先生的桃子，眞是極大的威脅。於是陶老先生，不恥不問，便去請敎是什麽緣故？安知道士竟賣關子：『這是仙家妙法，』陶老先生沒有求過神仙，自然無『法』可施了。</p>
<p>陶老先生知道，那位道士喜吃紅燒蹄膀；一天，陶老先生開了那『設而常關』的門，請道士過來酒叙。</p>
<p>才坐定，一個僕僕買了隻　子囘來。</p>
<p>『這到最配我的胃口，』道士想，『可惜，現在還是生的，等會吃起來，一定不够爛。』</p>
<p>不一會兒，一大盤紅燒蹄膀送上桌來，上口鮮美爛熟，這使道士不得不請敎了。</p>
<p>『陶老先生，這蹄子怎的煮得這樣快呀？』</p>
<p>『這也是　家妙法，』陶老先生，也賣起　子來。『不過，着是妳願意的話，我們不妨交換一下『仙法』，你吿訴我那桃子。』</p>
<p>道士立刻同息了：我那　子，方法很簡單，只要　開花的時候，抽掉裏面一根花蕊就行了。」</p>
<p>「我這個更簡單了，叫家人昨天晚上預先意一隻起來，不也就行了嗎？」</p>

<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文概述</p>
<p>一九一四年秋，德輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械昌比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上接着個消息，證英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來。不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息。幸虧冰山不久便滑過去了，但是旅客却受驚得失常，閙了一場事，不久，又有一艘英兵艦來　截，開炮起來……</p>
<p>七　船尾中砲了</p>
<p>「哎呀！」海斯鮑佛太息着，『也許我們受了傷！』</p>
<p>他的話，沒來　及說完，那邊，又冒出一股煙，飛快的，發着火光，又來了一個大聲音，但是，這一聲次，陪着　音來的，還有一個鋼鐵辟裂的響聲，而這船也就震盪起來，似乎是觸上了礁石。</p>
<p>『後面的煙卣，』傑克叫着，一面指着煙卣上那個炸裂的洞口。</p>
<p>『再來一個，一定更近啦，』比爾透了一口氣，差不多在戰抖着</p>
<p>在下面的甲板上，簡直是翻天覆地的亂起來，女人們昏過去了。一些侍役們，和低級職員們，盡力的維持着這羣受驚的人們。炮打中了煙卣，更使他們又急又恨，代表人再去找船長，要求立刻停船。</p>
<p>代表還沒有到架樑上，在樓梯上遇見了一個職員，他客客氣氣的吿訴他們，船長對於停船的話，沒有一點商量的餘地。</p>
<p>第三炮，更響，更近，不過在頭頂上飛過去了。</p>
<p>『我不相信他們是眞　轟　這條，也船許只是想威脅船長停船靠啦。』傑克說。</p>
<p>『照這樣看起來來，』比爾也同意這話，『也許是威嚇，我猜他們會勝利的，像現在，除了船長和他的手下，誰都在着急。』</p>
<p>『無疑的，那巡洋艦，倒是眾望所歸啦。』魯蒙加羅說：</p>
<p>『不錯，但是，看，又來了一條。』傑克突然指着後面喊着，『那一定就是鮑佛聽見「維勃克」號和她通話的那個。』</p>
<p>『們受夾攻啦，』比爾說：『我願意那個豬頭三的船長趕快停船，讓他們拿去這些金子和德國人吧。』</p>
<p>他們都戰戰競競的站在那兒，等着巡洋艦上再開砲，傑克忽然的，又叫起來了。</p>
<p>『看，前頭是什麼！我們還有一綫救星。』</p>
<p>在他們的前面霧氣已經在陽光照耀的水面，慢慢地築上了一重屛障。</p>
<p>「霧！」此爾高興的叫着。</p>
<p>『對於我們，只怕還不够濃哩。』加羅說。</p>
<p>『船長洛克也許早見及此了，所以他不肯停船。」傑克說，「當然囉，若是我們是知道有這一來，也不致於慌做一團啦。』</p>

<h3 id="c38">夢回憶與現實 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 紫金</p>
<p>人們的生活態度，依照日本那位前幾年爲了「拍拉圖式一的戀愛而自殺了的白　派的文人有島武郎的歸納所得，大概可分成三類：一是把做夢的眼睛一直　未來，一個「未來一再一個一未來」：在半空中，架起華麗矞皇的樓閣，自己撰作着未來，有如何璀璨的日子。其二是一味以追念「過去」而遺發剩餘的時間。這一班一過去的幽靈一，用惜，嘆息，眼淚，虛幻的光，把一堆發墟，一座灰色的古城堡，彫飾成一片錦天繡地，自己伏在這當中，俯仰瞻戀，怡然自得。對於活生生的「現實旣索然乏味，對於霧樣的未來也懶懶然，像惡魔詩人渡特萊爾所樂道的這兩個字眼，全生活只是「沉醉」在過去中。其叁是旣不依依於「過去一，也不在一未來一的身上打無謂的念頭，只是抓住現實，肯定現實，在現實的世界裏赤膊打仗。這三種的生活態度，也惟有最後的一種最光榮，最感動人。最值得大　直書。</p>
<p>「人生茫茫難自料。」我們的未來猶如一片大海，浩浩無垠，我們用不，捉三摸四：卽是荷馬的史詩，奧德賽裏面的那位大預言家Mentor老先生還吃得肥肥地健在着。他也不敢預言你的一尊夢一非否兌現？但作爲「人」的我們却往往雖已一心照不宜」，而仍成天做夢，這是第一流的糊塗蟲。倘說世事令人憂鬱，憤懣，世界於你是一個無涯的苦海，你厭惡牠，借一個「夢」躲避，但何不如叔本華，來一服昨命藥，直　了當，實際是作爲「人」的我們，旣缺少毅力，又痛惜那麽一條多餘的生命，於是便免不了充「糊塗蟲」。不管怎樣滔滔的雄辯，也還是一大堆遁詞，一大堆廢話！</p>
<p>關於追念「過去」，卽普通所謂「囘憶」，梅特林克曾經讀美過，以爲是我們「有生之年的温室」，我們當然也不能不默認「囘憶』所給於我們的温暖之感。然而一個人可愛的生命倘僅是安放到囘憶的歲月裏聽具悄悄地老，又悄俏地死，那又何必勞動曾脚，到這人世間來走一遭，柴霍甫或者帝俄時代一位權威的作家曾經對我們疾聲喊過：「一切的囘憶，都是有毒的！」梅特林克一面在讚嘆過去是我們有生之年的温室之後，一面便也警告　同時這也是一座死城。一如其像一個太被　太迷信的朝山敎徒似的只懶惰地默然滿足於美麗的寂滅的廢址，那麽，我們的過去若是愈光榮愈　樂的話，我們應該愈加懷疑牠一。在一篇題爲過去的論文裏，這位比利　的作家吼叫着說：「你們太常常憑弔我們的墳墓了。你們以爲是囘復了我們的生活，勇氣和愛情：其實是奪了我們的生活，勇氣和愛悄。」事實上是：一個人的生活倘到了只剩「感舊」「懷昔」「傷逝」，這一人在世界上便只能算是一個若有若無的人，或者最多不過是一條幢幢的影不罷了：</p>
<p>夢，囘憶之類都是我們的絆脚石，我們都應該一足踢開去，惟有熱烈地愛議現實才是我們惟一的路。</p>
<p>偉大的哥郭理說過：「我們被召到世上來完全不是爲了佳節和酒宴，我們是來鬥爭的，因此我們一瞬間也不要忘記我們走進了戰場，在那裏，而且不能單揀危險較少的地帶；應該像一個好戰士，把我們的一切都投到那戰鬥正劇烈的地方去。這一些話使我們很感動，而且給了我們很好的啓迪和敎養。一個人倘會去正視現實，在現實中掙扎，沉毅而果敢，像我們那整飾整營整團爲捍衛國土而作着壯烈犧牲的士兵，雖然「犧牲」了，而一年也好，十年也好，一百年也好，如同偉去的羅曼，羅蘭在高爾基死時所致敬的誄詞中所說：「　最美麗，最神聖的墳墓，却在我們的心頭。」</p>
<h3 id="c39">隴海線上　—從商邱到蘭— <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>村野間已充滿了夜的氣息，天上閃爍着星粒，照耀着微弱的光線。</p>
<p>我們一行四人，伴着一隻藏有重要東西的公文箱——它由一個弟兄負担着。靠了星光的助力，在曲折的小徑上行動；兩旁叢生着麥稈，在星光下搖曳着，我們在這麥影縱橫的麥隴上快速地穿過。</p>
<p>負著重祖的弟兄，愈走愈快，我們的脚步，也隨之加緊，勁都集中在兩腿，誰都沒有開過口，寂靜的空間，祗有單調的担子在支支地，伴奏着一快的步聲。我們的目的地商邱車站，就在這種加速度下到達了！</p>
<p>跑進車站，阿發突然活躍起來，他首先發現車站前，正順馴地躺着排　頭向西的列車喜得跳了起來，大聲地叫著：「我們的運氣眞不小呀！」靜寂的空氣，給他打破了！</p>
<p>一且慢數喜，我想沒有那麽便宜的事吧！老兪對這列車並不抱　樂觀。</p>
<p>我們把行李和公文箱，放在一邊、由弟兄担任警戒，然後跑近列車。</p>
<p>車箱裏沒有燈火，在黑暗中因動著一大堆黑黝黝的人頭；他們是國家的細胞，現在正在覺醒中開始摸索的羣衆。問他們什麽時候開到這裏，他們的囘答是說，已過了兩個夜了！</p>
<p>我們跑進站長室，站長忙著在電話機上工作，手裏的第，迅速地在紙上滑動；他微笑著向我們點點頭，意思是在昭呼我們。</p>
<p>「請問站長，前面那輛車，什麽時候可以開動？」我待他話筒剛離手的時候，就發問。</p>
<p>「這車是沒有一定的，因爲向東的車太多，而且更需要，西行的就不能預知了……」</p>
<p>「那末今夜有沒育傷兵車下來呢？」我打斷了他的話，接著又問。</p>
<p>「傷兵車嗎——他翻著剛才給筆滑過的簿子。「——有，大概在十二點左右。」話很肯定。</p>
<p>「那末我們就等待這輛車吧！」我囘顧其餘幾個同志。從經驗中知道，傷兵車比較迅速，在每站躭擱時間很少的，他們都沒有異議。</p>
<p>候車是件最無聊而不耐煩的事，我們要使時間過得快一點，就同站隨長便談起來，他很會說話，像個圓滑的大腹賈。</p>
<p>但這方法並不覺得有效，我拚命抽著烟捲，一根接著一根，烟尾和火柴，聚了一大堆，壁上的鐘，還是那麽悠遊自得地不肯前進。</p>
<p>好容易又消磨過了二個鐘頭，電話中傳來了一個可喜的消息，說傷兵車已從前站開出，但到這裏却要近一點　了。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c40">到商城的道中　—戰地鎖憶— <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>强行軍！必需要在一天半之內趕完了原來預定好三天完畢的行程。</p>
<p>走山野的捷徑，人呀，馬呀，蜿蜓爬行，遠看去像一條編辮的黃繩，枴　抹角，一會兒被山尖隔斷，一會兒又連成了一修線，捷克式步槍，俄國輕機關槍，還有洋鏟，在十足的陽光中，反射出耀眼的光亮，一些粗壯黑紫的大腿，走起路來沙土直響，馱子隊跟担子彈的走在一起，像趕市的，沒有話語，大家夥只是靜靜地爬山，趕路，向前，穿過大別山。</p>
<p>從對面，路上絡繹不斷地下來些傷兵，臂膊上綁着紗布，還有腿上受傷的，咬着牙，咧着嘴，柱着棍子，一步一痛地向前移動。從他們的符號上看出來他們是一一三和一一四師，他們臉上十分骯髒，血　的軍衣發散出刺鼻欲嘔的臭氣。有人在問：</p>
<p>「同志，打那邊下來？」</p>
<p>「商城。」</p>
<p>「戰事已經到了商城？」</p>
<p>「不，東邊的葉家集。」</p>
<p>「走下來幾天？」</p>
<p>「四五天了。」</p>
<p>「仗打得激烈麽？」</p>
<p>「够瞧了。」</p>
<p>「你們是那一軍。」</p>
<p>「五十一軍。」</p>
<p>「啊，東北軍。」</p>
<p>「是的，從淮河，打到商城。」</p>
<p>爲什麽不給這些傷兵坐汽車呢？他們的目的地是麻城，還得定三四天才能入院，受了傷，身體已經失去了本有的健康，再加上走路勞累傷口無處換藥，能够平安地支持着走到麻城，可眞是難能。可是這些受傷的弟兄們，沒有怨言，沒有憤恨，只是默默地慢慢地趕着艱難的路程。</p>
<p>拯救傷兵，是一個嚴重問題，在政府無暇顧及的時候，是正需　民衆團體來担當這任務的。</p>
<p>漸潮地，可以聽見沉重的砲聲，震得山嗚谷嘯。隊伍是漸漸接近前錢了，漸漸地「進入情况」。</p>
<p>還可以看見無數難民，男的，女的，老的，小的慌慌張張，成羣成　地向南逃去。沿路的房屋，十家有九家空出來，能祖着走的輕便東西全挑走了，剩下些笨重的傢具，冷淸淸地被丟在屋子　。</p>
<p>「前方的戰事怎麽樣了？」</p>
<p>「啊。怕人哪。」</p>
<p>「你們打什麽地方逃來的？」</p>
<p>「方家集，葉家集，你們到那邊去呀？」</p>
<p>「上前線。」</p>
<p>在難民身上，所表現出來的。只是慌張，逃避和對於戰爭的恐　，只知道設法保全個人或是一家的安全，却沒有國家民族抗戰救亡的意識。</p>
<p>「爲什麽要逃呢？」</p>
<p>「不逃怎麼　，×××××。」</p>
<p>「留下幹哪！××××正該跟他們拚！天天跑，跑到什麽地方才是止境！」</p>
<p>「我們也不是兵，…</p>
<p>「教國××要軍民一致！」</p>
<p>「沒有槍也上不得前線。』</p>
<p>「那還可以在前線後方救救傷兵運點給養呢，都逃起來，×××××！」</p>
<p>哼……嘻嘻……」</p>
<p>沒有理會這些話，話有如耳旁風，聽完也就忘下了，這樣是慌慌張張逃了去。</p>
<p>爲什麼老百姓要逃呢？這責任應該由誰來負？埋怨老百姓不肯爲國服務麽？…</p>
<p>師長搖頭，止不住感動地說道：</p>
<p>「這　不是好現象。」</p>
<p>「中國的老百姓太可　了。」</p>
<p>「民衆動員的工作根本沒有作起來，因此才有這般現象。」</p>
<p>「是呀，把民衆組織起來，軍民合作，抗戰才有前途。作戰上也是一定能够減去許多困難』．</p>
<p>「我們這次到前方。！定要組　起民衆」。</p>
<p>第二天近午時分，隊伍終於在預定時閒內，以強行軍的速度走完了路程。</p>
<p>商城，是河南東南的重鎭，是湖北，河南，安徽中間的要道。敵人正集中主力，預備將商城佔據。然後分兵西進直趨信陽，南下進攻麻城，完成句圍武漢的外圍戰。</p>
<p>然而商城無恙，敵軍在葉家集被阻，我們的隊伍却在這時開到了商城。</p>
<p>商城是個小小的　城，在城牆上，大大小小寫出些抗敵的標語，道旁有得是傷兵，橫　緊臥地，有的睡覺有的直張眼睛望着天，在他們的近旁，到處少不了模糊的血，腥的臭氣，一堆堆的蒼蠅，緊繞着那些血泊和傷口飛鳴。</p>
<p>城裏，家家戶戶關着門，白天裏全跑到城外去躲避飛機，在這以前，×機在城　投過三個炸彈，把人們嚇得十分的慌恐，</p>
<p>這裏　像是一座死城，連縣長都躲到鄉下去　他的公務去了。</p>
<p>這時候，可以更淸晰地聽到重砲的吼聲，震撼着整個的城池，走進了戰地了。</p>
<p>存街市上，買不到油，貿不到鹽，連香烟都無人販賣，作買賣的人，也全在自天逃到城外去只有在晚上，點起燈，作上一會兒交易。</p>
<p>臨時內命令，是：</p>
<p>「師部改設在八里潭」。</p>
<p>八里潭離開商城還有十五里，在城北面，要翻　幾座小山，人累了，腿酸了，但是，毫無　言地仍然離開脚步走向前去，準備跟敵人交鋒。</p>

<p>這時從那小小的圓窗望出去，已經沒有那殘缺的屋壁，也沒有遠近的烟樹，只是一片碧　的水，和遠天所砌成的一條線忽高忽　地起伏着，她心裏默想着大約已經出了海口，便把頭伸近那窗口，儘若　睛望去，再也沒有邊岸，無涯的海一直伸展開去；滾進的波浪，留下雪白的泡沬，因爲船行而被激勘的水，愉快地自山地響若，她確切地知道了已經離開那方魔地纔把一顆懸着的心放下來她被激動得眼裏含滿淚，一下跳到下邊的那個舖位，粗魯搖着正在酣　的靜聞的身　：</p>

<p>靜聞迷茫地坐起來，不提防被上邊舖位的木板把頭碰了一下，可是她沒有氣惱，只是一邊用手揉着頭皮，一邊隨她走近窗口望出去。</p>
<p>她們不到不然地同聲嘆嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>在那狹窄的艙勇裏，她們面對面地坐下來，相互地望着那套不稱身的華　的衣裝和余抹得又紅又白的臉　兩個人，都忍不住地笑了。她們本來期望着一番嚴厲的檢查，不曾　到什麽也沒有就過去了，　聞就得意地說：</p>

<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>六日最末尾的一個星期日、全香港的閩僑、假座加路山的孔聖堂、舉行國民公約的宣誓、參加男女老少的閩僑、超過一千人以上、在這個暑氣　蒸的休沐日裏、大家能够把消暑的時光、用在這種莊嚴神聖的宣誓禮裏、這種齊一而熱烈的行動、多麽可貴，記　加過十次以上這樣的宣誓禮·每次的感觸多不同，而以這次所給我的印象最算深刻。在那裏、把閩人作事的「　力」、完全表露無遺了。</p>
<p>從下午一卹鐘起到三點鐘止，通孔取堂的大道——加露連山，不斷跑着汗透重衣而來參加這個　誓禮的閩僑，熱那烘的太陽，把人們的心房，煎得更加滾熱起來！參加國民公約的宣誓啊！這是一件多麽榮耀，多麽興奮的事情，來賓最末尾的一個是監誓員吳鐵城先生，他這天穿着杏灰色的　絨衣很安閒地踏上石階、精神較以前更加　旺起來了</p>
<p>開會的儀節，一項一項地過去，主席許地山站起來很簡單地說出今天開會的意思，這一幕隆重而又嚴肅的宣誓　，便告展開，舉着右手，口念誓詞，不違背三民中義！不……！這種沉重而又壯烈的聲昔。整齊，嚴蕭，已經沒有個人的存在，而是鐵一般的整個，更沒有千百個口，而是一個口；一個巨大的偉怪人之口吼出反抗×人最有力的吼聲！</p>
<p>宣誓完畢，大家都於嘆一口緊張的氣氛，監誓人吳鐵城先生站起來致詞，首先他指出：『這個國民公約，是在今春的國民參政會提議通過的，它的目的，不但加强我們抗戰的意識，增加我們抗戰的信仰，而是要我們中華民族在靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟下、宣誓國民公約，使每個人雖然怎樣在艱難困苦的環境裏也不致動搖抗戰的信念！」</p>
<p>頓了一頓，他繼續說下去，抗戰已經有兩年了，以我們的軍備，來抵抗强的×人，竟能抗拒兩年之久，而且愈戰而愈强。這是甚麽道理？這就是全國民衆意志堅强的表現。×人挾着最優勢的軍械，動員了全國之兵、不能把我們打敗，這就是勝利了」。說到這裏堅决而且用力地叫着。一陣連殊砲般的掌聲，劃破了緊凑的氛圍。</p>
<p>繼續他說出：「我們最後勝利的獲得，幷不是少數人，或者三幾天，甚至打三兩場的勝仗可以奏功的，要怎麼樣？」，說到這裏，他背轉身　敎授般的指着兩邊牆角隅的標語念道，一有錢出錢，有力出力，國家至上，民族至上。電事第一，勝利第一，抗戰必勝，建國必成，全國國民能够一致的完成上述的義務，然後纔可以取得勝利！」這時候他急切得，不多要把勝利攫過來的樣子。又是一陣激烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>「我們×人的力量太大了，所以我們需要很大的力量，和很大犧牲，　可以擊破×人的力量。我們要對付我們頭强的×人，我們就要積極利用我們地大物博的優點，避免我們的弱點，我們有了充分的意識，更要有緊决而不動搖的信念，那末，最後勝利，一定是我們的！』</p>
<p>「劈劈迫迫一暴雨般的掌聲過後，」他跟着說：「國民公的頒佈後，窮鄉僻壤都舉行宣誓，每個國民都熱烈地舉行宣誓·我相信全國經過這個國民公約宣誓以後·一定很快的把×人在中國的力量打破！『迫迫迫』一陣掌聲，「恢復我們的獨立！」又是一陣掌聲「恢復我們的自由！』一陣更熱烈史龐大的掌聲。</p>
<p>跟着他說出：『我們祖先，對此界上的文明，有很大的貢獻，世界上所有的東西，我們中國都具有，相信我們過去着光榮的歷史，將來也一定不爲×人所屈服的！「又是一陣熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>福建是中國沿海最大的省份之一，也是接受西歐文明最早的一個省份，福建的民埃，在淸末民初反抗異族的精神，在中國的歷史上，是很光榮的。中華民族革命歷史最光榮的一百——三月二十九日黃花崗七十二烈士的起義，就是你們福建同鄉首先舉起手來！說到這裏，他的手也跟着舉起了。掌聲的劇烈，震耳欲襲。</p>
<p>繼着他說福建人在中華的革命時代，有着這種貢獻，這不但是福建人的光榮！而是全中國人的光榮。</p>
<p>經過一陣沉默以後，他繼續說：「由香港說到南洋的華僑，福建人佔了一牟，英，荷·法屬這些地方的事業，在福建人的手裏有一半，現在南洋的繁榮，福建人是要佔了一半的功績，福建省份的人民，有抵抗異族，開僻疆士的創造力，相信將來中華民族取得了抗戰的最後勝利，福建省人民，一定佔了很大的力量，所以希望其他各省的人民以及居留民都能够像福建人民一樣的熱心。團結起來，共同取我們的最後勝利，「，掌聲送他坐下了。</p>
<p>下一個秩序便是由　光孩子團歌詠，一個孩子跑出來佈告，他們逃難到香港以來，算是今天最歡喜了。繼續他報告喝五支歌，歌聲强有力的打入人們的心坎，特別是那個「最後勝利是我們的！「最感動人，繼看呼口號怕照才散。」</p>

<p>潮汕戰事爆發後之第二日、旅港潮僑以故鄉蒙難、當卽發　救濟、潮僑籌賑會會經於本月廿三晚召開緊急會議、招集全港潮喬領袖、會商救濟方法、議决去電海外各地潮僑一致發動救鄉運動、同時並舉行負責人員担任起草救鄉計劃、自經會議後、上述工作卽加緊進行、</p>
<p>通電各方　籲請救濟</p>
<p>該會致政府當局及海外各潮僑團體通電、昨日經已發出，原文如下、「國民政府僑務委員會省政府、中賑會、新加坡潮州八邑會館、退羅潮州會館、檳榔嶼潮州會館宅郡潮州會館、堤岸潮州會館、雪蘭娥潮州會館、吉降坡潮州會館、山打根潮僑公會、馬六　潮州會館、新州潮州會館金　潮州會館、東京潮州會館、金邊潮僑議員會、廣州潮州會館總理、曁諸位鄉先生均鑒、×不悔禍、大肆侵略、我莊嚴燦爛之汕頭市、又不幸于本月廿一日倫陷于×、敝同人等聞訊之餘、緬懷家鄉、不勝悲慣、當卽召集緊急會議、進行救濟事宜、經議决舉定職員、負責籌劃進行救濟辦法、並卽電請旅外潮僑團體及當局設法救濟難民在案、除照案加緊辦理外，特電奉達、務請一致般法救濟，共拯災難是　、香港　僑籌賑兵災難民會主席團林子曹、許友梅、馬澤民，林子實同叩、便、</p>
<p>中賑會將　撥欵救濟</p>
<p>該會除發出十項通電外、並將分函香港各界眼聯會，華商總會籌賑會及其他籌賑團體，籲請援助、據悉中央賑濟委員會許委員長世英、對于救濟潮汕兵災難民一事、甚表關懷、將干日間撥欵賑濟、許委員長昨日己派出表晤見潮僑籌賑會主席團林子鹽等、商洽救濟辦法、各界賑聯會亦將于下次會議提出討論、據本港嘲汕商消息，已接星洲潮僑團　電吿，當地潮僑得聆家鄉警耗之初、卽商討一切、一般潮僑之意見、擬成立潮僑救鄉總團體、負責辦理救鄉工作、</p>
<p>救濟工作　注重內地</p>
<p>至于本港潮僑籌賑會之救濟計劃、業已由該會委員林子實負責起草、一二日內、卽可革竣、提交下次會議討論、一俟工作大綱决定後、卽可加緊進行、據林氏稱、目前急切之舉、厥為籌　款項，至于救濟辦法、將來工作地點將注重干潮汕後方、蓋汕頭與其他地方不同，在×人進犯前、我當局早有准備、人口牧資大部疏散、市內民衆十之八九、已向後方遷栘、戰事發生後未及逃出之雖民甚少、來港者至今亦有百餘人、且中多富戶，無救濟之必要相信當時留於戰區之難民人敬不多、因此今後工作、將注重于潮汕後方云</p>
<p>服務團將　囘鄉工作</p>
<p>關于汕頭戰區附近　民情况何若，據潮州商會負資人表示、至現在止尙未得接確實報吿、當地唯一慈善機關存心善事，是否繼續辦理救濟難民工作、亦未知悉、必要時或有派員返鄉調査之可能云。又　本港　州同鄉會去冬曾組織　鄉服務團、參加者廿餘人、在港經相當時間訓練後、卽在潮汕一帶服務、×佔南澳及轟炸潮汕時、該團　理救護工作、頗有成績、數月前返潮調整、現因汕頭戰事爆發、該團已準備于日間再度出發潮汕為桑　服務。現正籌劃中，俟準備就緒、卽可出發云</p>

<p>友卑先作攻擊組、蘇沙乘四球數之便、進佔一壘、鴨巴士擊球從二壘與游擊之問　去、為蔡炳芬捕得、急傳二壘林業、先黜蘇沙出局、林業又投球至胡國棟、及時截殺鴨巴士、演出雙殺局佳作、掌聲雷動、奧夏高理上陣時、得自由壘、李安納　一全壘打、乃與奧夏高理先後奔返本疊、連獲兩分、</p>
<p>輸至中華作攻擊組時、陳芳檳球得一壘打、但旋因偷壘被黜、林業與區炳南則相繼出局、一無所獲、</p>
<p>次局亞利得自由壘，繼而偷至二壘·地李安納一擊因陳倫英之漏接地球、進佔一壘、而亞利則　機偷歸、但地李安納則旋為陳倫英所刺殺，黃榮俊此時情緒緊張、投四壞球、讓榮利行登一壘、旋上二壘、及至小李安納擊一安打、榮利遂獲一分、幸蘇沙及鴨巴士上場時、連為黃榮俊好球擲死、危局始解、輪至中華作政時、形勢頗　、黃榮　蔡炳芬皆得安打、胡正渠亦會進至三壘、但以對方守衛嚴密、無法得分、又以零局而散、</p>
<p>第三局友卑奧　高理、李安納、及夏高理三上三落、被中華殺個痛快、中華反攻時、胡國　得「自由壘」，陳芳擊球上壘、但友卑三壘手截取來球、傳二壘手、殺死胡國楝、轉瞬間陳芳活躍異常、偷至二壘、及至林業得一壘安打時、陳芳卽向大本營奔馳、飛身剷壘，渝得一分、打破光蛋、不幸林業進至三壘時、被奧夏高理投之出局、區炳南擊出之飛球、又為亞利接死，至是局散、</p>

<h3 id="c71">戰後評 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>中華失敗、並不是技術不如人、且所得安打為六與四之比、可見攻力不弱、在第四局時復一度演成佔全三壘之優勢、　乎所獲僅一分、是亦厄運所致、而輪至第五局為攻擊組時、原又輪至善擊球者上場、無奈諸擊手情緒緊張、反多擊不中、至是中華收局、乃由此定、蓋第四五兩局原為中華欲求反勝之最良機會、卒不能善為利用，終遭敗績、良可惜也、</p>
<p>然其致敗之最大徵結、則在第一二兩局為防守組時、　調陳方為捕手、及黃榮俊當時未得鎭定從事、竟先後弄出四球數四記之多、給予友碑以機會、故在此兩局竟失四分、複有陳倫英一次錯誤、於是敗兆呈矣、</p>
<p>雙方防守、並皆佳妙、故錯誤絕少、中華只有二次、友卑一次、則整個戰局之嚴密、於此可概見一斑、</p>
<p>黃榮俊雖有四記四球數、然三球數則演出十記之多、可見手段不凡、實比夏高理為佳、獨惜各目擊球不及對方之準確、　出又不能致遠、反使友碑演出刺殺廿一次、捕殺十五次之多之佳作、</p>
<p>今中華拚再敗一次、奪標希望、大受打擊、恐怕本屆「王座」、非復中華可得而居之矣、（球埸太歲）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sino-Soviet-French Treaties and the Climax of the International Anti-Aggression Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Just as we are suffering from the flames of war, with Germany, Italy, and Japan recklessly engaging in adventurous and speculative deceitful acts of aggression, and just as we are suffering from the rising poisonous flames of rumors, slander, instigation, and discord spread by the aggressors and their lackeys, the news of the establishment of the new Sino-Soviet and Sino-French treaties is like dispelling dark clouds and revealing the blue sky, bringing us boundless joy and excitement!</p>
<p>Firstly, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Trade Treaty in Moscow on the 16th of this month, and the establishment of the new Sino-French Loan Agreement on the 22nd of this month, fully demonstrate that our country's opposition to peaceful compromise over the past two years, adherence to unity and solidarity, and heroic resistance to the war have further consolidated and enhanced our international prestige. It fully demonstrates the trust and friendship of the socialist Soviet Union and democratic peace-loving France towards our government and people, which has further developed. It also fully demonstrates the righteous indignation and hatred of all countries that cherish democracy and peace towards Japanese aggression, proving the necessity and possibility of promoting the establishment of a collective security system for the anti-aggression front in the Far East. Today, we should not only maintain and enhance friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet Union and France, but we must also redouble our efforts to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all democratic peace-loving countries, especially Britain and the United States. Only through the close unity of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union can we thoroughly eliminate the crisis of a second world war and guarantee the progress of human civilization!</p>
<p>Secondly, the Singapore Conference on Anglo-French Far East military cooperation has now been decided upon and publicly announced, including items such as "the navy using escort methods to protect merchant ships, the Indian Air Force supplementing Singapore, and concentrating military raw materials and supplies." What is particularly noteworthy is that since Japan's aggression in May of last year, forcibly occupying Xiamen, forcibly occupying Guangzhou in October of last year, occupying Hainan Island in February of this year, forcibly occupying the Xinan Islands in March, landing on Gulangyu in May, blockading the Tianjin Concession in June, and recently forcibly occupying Shantou, the flames of war in the Far East have threatened to spread throughout Southeast Asia and even the entire Pacific Ocean. The Anglo-French Singapore Conference is discussing concrete measures to jointly defend against Japanese aggression. Therefore, this conference can also be regarded as the beginning of establishing an anti-aggression front in the Far East and ensuring a collective security system, and its significance is naturally very significant.</p>
<p>Thirdly, whether in Europe or the Far East, all movements to prevent aggression and defend peace cannot be without the participation of the United States, the largest democratic peace-loving country in the Americas. In particular, the increasing friendship between the United States and Britain is especially urgent and important in the Far East issue. What is gratifying and exciting is that the friendly relations between Britain and the United States have indeed reached an unprecedented level of harmony! The most notable of these is the issue of two small islands in the Pacific Ocean, which both countries were able to resolve through mutual concessions. Following this, the British King and Queen's visit to the United States of America received a warm welcome from officials and civilians across the country, laying the foundation for cooperation between the two major democratic countries of Europe and America to resist aggression and defend democracy and peace. Recently, there has been much talk of President Roosevelt of the United States visiting Britain, and the Anglo-American barter agreement was officially signed on the 23rd of this month. Even in the recent Tianjin incident, although Britain still exercised restraint and made concessions, the United States spoke out righteously and protested to Japan repeatedly. Although the Anglo-French Singapore Conference did not have American participation, it repeatedly stated its determination to maintain close ties with the United States and the Soviet Union. We believe that the friendly relations between Britain and the United States will surely make even more remarkable progress in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, the Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement was signed in Paris on the 23rd of this month. Geographically and militarily, this agreement is of great significance for stabilizing the Mediterranean and Near East situation. Politically, it will naturally greatly contribute to the active development of the European anti-aggression front. At the same time, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, in his capacity as chairman of the Balkan Entente, recently visited Ankara and Athens, and is drafting a new Balkan collective defense pact, preparing to expand the obligations of Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece, mutually guaranteeing each other's security, and providing mutual assistance in the event of any aggression. This movement is also of great significance for defending against the German and Italian aggressors who are threatening southern countries, and for maintaining collective security in Southeast Europe and the Near East.</p>
<p>At present, the most worrying thing is the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance negotiations, which have been beset by twists and turns. These negotiations are precisely the ones that have a decisive significance for all international peace, anti-aggression, and collective security movements. The main reason why these negotiations have been beset by twists and turns without success lies in the British government, which, on the one hand, is compelled to rely on the Soviet Union to show resistance due to the step-by-step encroachment of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and on the other hand, is afraid of the imagined "Bolshevik invasion" and attempts to leave a way out for the aggressive policies of Germany, Italy, and Japan in advance. However, at present, the Soviet Union is adhering to its position, striving for the establishment of a practical and universal collective security system, and the vast majority of people and political leaders in Britain and France are also unanimously urging the government to earnestly connect with the Soviet Union, coupled with the increasingly intolerable encroachment of the aggressors. The signing of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement cannot and will not be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>The new climax of the international anti-aggression movement is one of the main favorable conditions for us to strive for victory. We must firmly grasp it and strive to promote it, while strengthening unity, adhering to resistance, and fighting on the front lines of the anti-aggression movement for national independence and world peace.</p>
<h3 id="e2">"Hong Kong Team" in Guangdong - Summary of Work in May by the Third Group of the Hong Kong Students' Account Service Corps Returning to the Country <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Renfen</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Under the slogan of "Resistance against Japan above all else, everything subordinate to resistance," our forty active young comrades, in order to save the dying motherland and pursue the righteous peace of taking lives, ×××× even more unwilling to live a life of peace and comfort in the ivory tower, generally watching the fall of the motherland, and the vast majority of the artillery to my × people cruelly living under the world, there is no heaven. Therefore. We resolutely resolutely abandoned everything, representing 100,000 students in Hong Kong, returned to the motherland, the big battle scene, doing hard and meaningful work. It has been five months since today, we returned to the country to serve this time. In order to strengthen our work skills and political and military knowledge, we first went to the West River Administrative Office of the Provincial Government to participate in the training period, so we do not say how much contribution we have made to the country and the nation in our work, but in this rapid process, we have already done 4,000 miles, stepped over Guangdong's follow-up and how many lofty mountains, crossed a lot of small streams in the creek signed in the roadside mountain, in the collapsed temple and cramped and buried the corner, cold.</p>
<p>For the sake of the eagerness to save the country, in the hot sun, in the wind, in the fierce bombardment, I do not know how much suffering and hardship, the place of the prince, the battle and the style of the small group and the petty bourgeoisie, the lazy roots have long been in our ideological group life. The great struggle era has changed in appearance, and after several months of hard training, each one has become a tenacious and resolute fighter, we can not see that in the westward march of thousands of miles, we can still turn to Jiang, no one warrior is sick and left behind, this is a very fortunate thing.</p>
<p>On this mobile journey, there is not much fixed time for us to carry out our work properly, but we have not relaxed a moment of time without carrying out our tasks. At the same time, in the course of these four thousand miles, we have understood the current situation in the interior; and we have received a lot of comfort, which is enough to inspire our courage to move forward, and another direction can alert us to the necessity of intensifying our work in the future.</p>
<p>Here, because of time, we can only give a brief report on the situation in May.</p>
<p>(1) Hong Kong to Guangning</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 13, we left Hong Kong, took the Guan car from Hanmen to Zhongshan, arrived in Jiangmen on the 17th, and on the 19th, together with more than 100 students from the Political Brigade of the West River Administrative Office, continued the unfinished journey.</p>
<p>Starting from Jiangmen, passing through mountains and plains, the roads along the way have been automatically destroyed, so we had to walk slowly, and arrived at Shaping late at night, and spent the night in the county middle school. At that time, the air was very tense, only ten miles away from the front line, and people fired artillery at Shaping from time to time, but mostly in the wilderness. However, the most exciting thing is that all aspects are showing a state of emergency. This has a great relationship with the achievements of Heshui and Xinhui in the present day.</p>
<p>From Shaping to Gaoming is about ninety miles, we arrived on the evening of the 20th in one day's journey, because it was the first time to pull long, the comrades felt tired, so it was decided to rest in Gaoming Elementary School for a day, so we took this opportunity to open a mass meeting outside the southeast gate of the county seat, at that time Gaocheng had become a quiet dead city because of the cruel bombing by enemy planes, however, through the efforts of many comrades to call, but also got the help of local agencies and groups, the result of the participation of the people and the nearby village self-defense group, there are more than a thousand people, very enthusiastic, the high tension of emotions, so that we feel very excited, but also the first time to return to the motherland to get comfort.</p>
<p>On the 21st of January, when the morning light was faint, we left Gaoming and set off for Zhaoqing. When our team was not far from the city of Gaoming, eighteen aircraft came from the east at the fastest speed, circled around the county city, and dropped dozens of hundred-pound bombs outside the southeast gate of the county city. We were dormant in the grassland and finally spared this disaster. After the planes left, our comrades leaped up and ran back to the disaster area to pick up and save those innocent compatriots, so we stayed in Gaoming for another day.</p>
<p>In order to hurry to Lubu and avoid the trouble of air raids, we left Zhao night and night, arrived in Lubu on the 22nd, and Shuikou on the 23rd, averaging about sixty to seventy miles a day. After passing through many poor villages, we arrived at Bingkang, which belongs to Guangning County, on the 28th, which is a small market town, where we rested for two days, and took advantage of these two days to promote the more than 100 students of the political brigade traveling with us to organize temporary opera troupes, slogan troupes, cartoon troupes, speech troupes... etc. Cooperate with us to go to various villages and towns to carry out extensive propaganda work, and at the same time, at the invitation of the comrades of the local Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team, we gathered the local youth and the people to hold a symposium to discuss various problems of people's solidarity, and we were responsible for reporting on current affairs. In these two days of work, we dare not say that we have achieved good results, but our Hong Kong team (the name given to us by all parties) has been deeply recognized by the general public throughout Bingkeng.</p>
<p>On January 31, we walked one hundred and twenty miles under the fierce sun in one breath, and arrived at Guangning at about 9:00 p.m., and Xi Riji entered the camp for training, and from then on we began military political studies.</p>
<p>(2) During the training period</p>
<p>Our training location is more than three miles away from Guangning County, in a secluded valley, lush forests, verdant green mountains, green rocks, clear streams, people in between, as if entering a fairyland. When every day in the early morning, the sun has not yet come out of the face, the wake-up call sounded, hundreds of active young people quickly gathered in the vast square shrouded in the morning mist, began the morning meeting and morning exercises, at that time the weather in the West River in February was really terribly cold, we only wore a thin cotton coat. The lack of materials is really unexpected, all the equipment is unusually simple, the classroom is set in the arms of nature, and the old vegetables without oil and the half-sand half-rice that are eaten every meal, it is a pity that during this period, in addition to a few hours of surgical subjects every day, the training of other school subjects is simply nothing to gain. However, the students are eagerly in need of enriching themselves in terms of all thoughts and theories in order to prepare for future struggles, so everyone is very skilled. Or hide in the woods or in the dormitory, to steal reading newspapers and magazines, everyone is still as actively as possible to prepare to open up.</p>
<p>In this way, life in the training period is extremely hard, but we always can not forget the original intention of returning to the country, and can not forget the mission we bear, every comrade is the same in hard struggle to learn.</p>
<p>At the end of March, the West River Administrative Office was abolished, what should we do? In the midst of hesitation, we followed more than 200 students on a second journey - from the West River to the North River.</p>
<p>(3) West River to North River</p>
<p>In order to find the real anti-Japanese work, we traveled from the West River to the North River, passing through Qingyuan, Yangshan and Ruyuan counties, a total of about 1,800 miles, and traveled for 28 days. The comrades-in-arms carried heavy backpacks and bright knives and guns, passing through the Jiuqu Mountains of Qingyuan and the Flying Goose Ridge of Yangshan. The mountain roads were winding and rugged, as steep as a wall, and the tilted sheep intestines were winding and winding, which was already difficult to travel. In addition, there was no water in the whole mountain, and the mouth was about to dry out. In the hot sun, uphill and downhill, the difficulty was quite like crossing the desert and hardship, and the dangerous terrain was something that no one could have expected. Except for a rest halfway up the mountain, we walked for thirty-two hours before reaching the Central Plains area. In Beishi, Jiangtun, and Keng... whenever we passed a place, we had to do a propaganda work. When we arrived between Yangshan and Ruyuan, the culture in this area was relatively backward. Although there were two salvation groups, the work of the people was not done well. The general public did not understand the importance of military-civilian cooperation. Therefore, some of the people simply treated us like warlords in the past. When our team had not arrived, they ran away or closed the door, and the food for work became a problem here. Therefore, the troops that passed through felt the difficulty of supply and transportation, and a small number of troops with low political standards inevitably used coercive means to satisfy their demands when they passed through these places, so that the evil feelings between the army and the people were further deepened. We are responsible for these shortcomings, so we decided to leave the main force and specially extracted more than ten days to carry out our work in Chengjia, which belongs to Yangshan County, because Chengjia is the necessary route for traffic between Shao and Lian after the second phase of the War of Resistance, and it is also the most suitable guerrilla base in the future.</p>
<p>Our work in Chengjia, first of all, is to promote the establishment of a military-civilian party through a series of technical propaganda and win the belief of the general public, using the more prestigious gentry and existing groups in the area. The organization within the association is divided into service organizations, finance, and transportation departments, and there are also reading rooms and various meaningful entertainments such as sports and chess: etc. The cadres of each department are elected by the local, which not only enables the military and civilian aspects to be connected, but also in the future, the teams passing through need food, or they can directly negotiate with the association for requests to pick up thieves. In addition, we have also mobilized the more advanced young people and the local elementary school teachers who are generally trusted by the public to set up wartime schools (including women's literacy classes and adult classes) in the surrounding villages, which resulted in a harvest. In a short period of half a month, thanks to the efforts of the students, everything went smoothly, and the established wartime elementary schools have already had seven, and there are five more in preparation. Unfortunately, time does not allow us to stay there any longer. When we were about to leave, raising our handkerchiefs to bid farewell, the faces of the masses showed reluctance, which is a sign of our unity and recognition of the people, and also presents a living element of the great national revolution.</p>
<p>In early April, we arrived at Longgui, Qujiang, and that was where we were going. During the period, we waited for instructions from the Hong Kong relief committee, and at the same time, we worked with the political work team of the Fourth War Zone in Longgui to carry out extensive mass movement, and at the same time intensified self-education and character training. By mid-May, in order to meet the requirements of the anti-Japanese environment, we sent some students to work in the occupied areas, and the remaining more than 20 students recently continued to go through a long march of more than 300 miles, and ran to Wengyuan Wuhua to receive military training again. Here, we are getting closer to the front line, and I will soon go to the front line at the end of June to participate in direct military work, and here we can be regarded as temporarily announcing a fall.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The situation in Chaoshan is stabilizing, and our reinforcements are rushing forward day and night <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper's military urgent news on the 24th] The enemy who landed in Shantou has suffered many casualties after being intercepted by us for several days. They are still fighting fiercely with the enemy, and our army is marching forward day and night, and the situation is stable.</p>
<p>[Urgent news from Dalu News Agency Xingning] The troops of our aid force, the ×th Army, consisting of × divisions, marched urgently through Xingning County yesterday (24th) and went to Chaozhou to provide reinforcements. It is also reported that on the morning of the 25th, × planes in twelve groups flew in four teams along the Shaoshan Highway to scout Jieyang, Puning, Chaoan, Fengshun, Xingning, and Wuhua. At 12:00 noon, three planes flew to Xichang, Yiyang, and dropped two bombs, and continued to drop three bombs in Fuyang. The damage is unknown.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Chongqing on the 25th] After our army withdrew from the urban area of Shantou on the morning of the 23rd, they continued to fight fiercely with the enemy in the vicinity for the past two days. The entire Chaozhou-Shantou Railway line is under the control of our army. Chaoan and Chaoyang are both peaceful.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Haitong News Agency Shanghai on the 25th] According to a report from here, after occupying Shantou City, the Japanese army immediately implemented control over Chinese currency in the area and introduced the Japanese currency system, but it cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange. The Japanese authorities in Shantou stipulated that one yen was worth 1.30 yuan, but on the market, the exchange rate for yen was lower than that for yuan. Currently, there is a shortage of yen on the market, which is not enough for use, so the Japanese authorities have issued military currency to replace it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 25th] A report from Tokyo states that a reporter from the Japanese Daily News stationed in Shantou reported that a dispute occurred between the Japanese authorities and a British destroyer in Shantou on the 23rd of this month. On that day, the British destroyer No. 51 escorted the British ship "Jinan" to Shantou and docked at 1:00 p.m. The Japanese side was extremely angry because the British side had not notified the Japanese authorities in advance, and immediately set up obstacles at the berth of the British ship to isolate it, while demanding that both the British warship and the British ship must evacuate.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Needle Shanghai on the 25th] Since the British ship Jinan sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou yesterday and was protected by a British warship into the Shantou port, the Japanese naval authorities have issued an order that foreign merchant ships wishing to go to Shantou must notify the Japanese authorities 24 hours in advance and must obtain permission to transport food to supply foreigners and must be inspected by the Japanese army. As for other goods, they are not allowed to be transported to Shantou, for fear that some of them are "munitions" to be supplied to the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>Our army stormed into Shengang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Wengyuan on the 25th] Our plainclothes team stormed into Shengang, north of Conghua, on the night of the 21st and engaged in street fighting with the enemy. Our brave men charged and killed, destroying the enemy's radio station and house with hand grenades before safely withdrawing.</p>
<p>[Fast news from Dalu News Agency Zhongshan] The Sixth Guerrilla Zone Command, in order to intensify wartime preparations, is responsible for destroying highways and organizing teams, which are divided by Vice Commanders Zhang and Wu, who are responsible for handling them quickly. The Qiguan Highway has been divided into three sections and destroyed. The requisition of civilian labor is extremely enthusiastic. Vice Commander Zhang Huichang set off on the 23rd and 24th of this month to inspect. Those who have not reached the original destruction standard continue to carry out the work. The organization and reorganization of the team are the responsibility of Commander Chen and Nan. Too old and weak, checking weapons, replenishing the number, and distributing them to the locality are all ordered to be handled one by one. In addition, there is no abnormality in the Japanese ships off the coast of Zhongshan. Enemy planes pass through every day. The river surface of Yingzui, adjacent to Xinhui, was disturbed by enemy ships a few days ago and suffered setbacks. There has been no further offense so far.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The counter-offensive in southern Shanxi is approaching Yuanqu. The enemy attacking the Zhongtiao Mountains has suffered nearly 2,000 casualties. The enemy in Qianjiang, Hubei, is about to be resolved. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xi'an on the 25th] Our unit in southern Shanxi launched a counter-attack and reached the outskirts of Yuanqu. The battle was fierce on the night of the 24th. There was contact on the banks of the Heihe River and near Xiaxian County and Liangxian County.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Chongqing on the 25th] Our military is gradually realizing the established plan, and the combat effectiveness is getting stronger. The enemy in southern Shanxi is sending reinforcements and attacking the Zhongtiao Mountains again. After four days and nights of bloody battle, they were severely attacked by us, with nearly 2,000 casualties. At the moment, a large number of our reinforcements have arrived at their destinations, and the battle will be greatly developed.</p>

In total, the number of enemies killed in the past three days has exceeded 2,000. Now a part of our army has approached Yuanqu. The enemy has been suppressed by us and has fled in large numbers.

<p>[Minge News Agency Yixian on the 25th] On the 20th, a large part of the Jinxiang enemy was withdrawn to the east, leaving only a hundred people, with two artillery pieces, to defend. On the 17th, our air force flew to attack Huoxian. The enemy mistakenly thought it was their own plane and was not prepared, so the loss was very heavy.</p>

There are only 400 or 500 enemies left in Qianjiang, and we are besieging them and are about to resolve them. Our guerrillas are active in the vicinity of Xinyang these days. The war in southeastern Shandong is gradually improving. These days, there have been contacts in Yishui, Mengyin, Juxian, and Rizhao counties.</p>
<h3 id="e5">After the establishment of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement, our country's source of military supplies is becoming more and more abundant. Speculation in diplomatic circles in Moscow. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Moscow on the 25th] This morning's newspapers here all published the detailed content of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement signed on the 16th of this month. Last night, the official Soviet news agency TASS officially announced the establishment of this agreement. The diplomatic community here paid great attention to the official strict secrecy and said that Chinese representative Sun Ke had been staying here for three months and had been received by Stalin, but the Soviet newspapers remained silent about it. The diplomatic community also paid great attention to the fact that the date of the agreement was signed long before the British special envoy Strachan arrived here, but it was delayed until now, when the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations reached a stalemate before it was announced. It is also said that since the establishment of this agreement, the number of Soviet military supplies transported to China will increase greatly. It is generally believed that the highway from northwestern China through Xinjiang into Soviet territory and directly to Moscow has also been greatly improved, which is sufficient for large-scale military transportation.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A foreign dispatch from Tianjin reports that an incident occurred here yesterday in which Japanese troops prohibited a British officer from passing through a Japanese checkpoint. This is the first time since the Japanese blockade of the concession that Japanese troops have obstructed British officials. British military authorities have declined to comment on the matter. However, a Reuters reporter has learned from reliable sources that yesterday morning, a British officer in uniform, riding in a military vehicle driven by British soldiers, arrived at the Japanese barrier at Asahi Street (leading to the Japanese Concession), intending to enter the Japanese Concession. Japanese troops ordered them to stop, stating that if they wished to pass, they could use a rickshaw, but only after being searched by the Japanese. The British officer refused the Japanese conditions and left.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A foreign dispatch from Tianjin reports that Mrs. Fenler, a British resident, was also taken into a room and searched by the Japanese yesterday afternoon while passing through a Japanese barrier on Machang Road.

Davis and Mr. Lauter were passing through Machang Road from the British Concession at 12:30 PM. At the border, Japanese troops ordered the two to stand and wait for a search. After the two had stood for seventy minutes, several other foreign residents passed through after being searched. Finally, Davis and Lauter were also allowed to approach for inspection. Davis was first ordered to undress, and the Japanese even ordered him to exhale for inspection. Subsequently, the Japanese ordered him to lie on the ground to show that he was not carrying anything. Lauter was then subjected to the same type of search. Most outrageously, the Japanese first threw Lauter's clothes on the ground and then ordered him to pick them up and put them on.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th, Location Omitted] Dinghai fell on the 23rd. Today, a reporter visited a military expert to inquire about his opinion on the Japanese occupation of Dinghai. According to him, since invading and occupying Wuhan and Nanchang, the Japanese have become militarily lost, facing a dilemma and unsure of what to do. The recent defeats suffered by the Japanese forces on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and in western Shanxi and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, all prove that the Japanese have reached a dead end. Fearing that this would cause turmoil within Japan, the Japanese warlords have repeatedly resorted to outrageous actions, initiating the Xiamen Incident and blockading the British and French concessions in Tianjin. More recently, they have captured Shantou, aiming to threaten Britain, the United States, and France, and to stimulate the people and ease anti-war sentiment. The Japanese occupation of Dinghai is no different. Its military value, however, is minimal.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A dispatch from Tianjin reveals that, according to sources close to the Japanese side, Wang Jingwei, in his betrayal, has proposed terms to the Japanese during his visit to Japan, requesting that the false federal government be established in Nanjing and continue to use the flag with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. The Japanese side has also proposed two conditions: (1) that the false federal government sign an anti-communist pact with Japan, allowing Japan to station troops in necessary locations in both the north and south; and (2) that an economic agreement be signed with Japan, placing China's important industrial resources under Japanese management and operation. Both sides have largely agreed. Therefore, Wang Kemin still has hopes of remaining in a position of power in the north.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry's recent restrictions on withdrawals in Shanghai were originally due to the recent surge in withdrawals from the Shanghai market to purchase foreign exchange.

It is still hoped that the market will return to normal in the short term, and the aforementioned measures will be lifted after considering the situation. Therefore, the original telegram stated that these are temporary measures, and the Financial Stabilization Measures announced on August 15, 1937, have also been circulated by the Ministry and remain in effect.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Finance has decided to strengthen the management of exchange, revising previous measures. The revised measures were announced on the 3rd and will be implemented on July 1st.

The amount of cash that could be taken from within Japan to abroad was limited to 1,000 yen. The revision stipulates that the total of both shall not exceed 500 yen. Furthermore, the original regulations stipulated that the salaries and travel expenses remitted by companies to overseas employees could not exceed 1,000 yen; this limit is now reduced to 500 yen. At the same time, the revised measures implement a licensing system for the import of banknotes. For amounts exceeding 200 yen, permission from the authorities is required.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Steel Armies and Iron Horses March: A Scene from Our Modern New Army's Grand Exercise (Part 2) <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>—…Zhang Changren…</p>
<p>Although the height was only XX meters and there were only shrubs and bushes, the height was the only barrier to the south of XX Town, and it was a place that both armies had to fight for. The Northern Army built solid fortifications here. Below the height was a swamp, and the front and rear of this ground were laid with three lines of barbed wire and some landmines. Light machine guns were positioned on both flanks, and some mortars were placed behind the height, which could form a tight network of fire. Therefore, although the Southern Army launched a fierce attack, it suffered great sacrifices and retreated. That night, they continued to strengthen their fortifications and replenish their ammunition to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a quick victory, the Southern Army mobilized all night, preparing to launch a general offensive to occupy the XXX height the next morning.</p>
<p>The next day at dawn, a gentle southeast wind was blowing in the sky. The chemical soldiers of the Southern Army, wearing white masks and rubber clothing, crept close to the left flank of the Northern Army's position, hiding in the dead angle below. Soon, several smoke pots were ignited, and thick white smoke drifted with the wind towards the Northern Army's position. Other chemical soldiers ran back and forth at a lower distance, holding smoke pots. The Northern Army sent a signal that the Southern Army was releasing a smoke screen, and concentrated fire to shoot the Southern Army's chemical soldiers in action, but was suppressed by the opponent with even greater firepower, ultimately to no avail. After XX minutes, a thick smoke screen covered the XXX height, and the Southern Army's position was as if in a five-mile fog. At this time, the Southern Army engineers carried out demolition of the defensive works in front of the XXX height, and a large number of tanks and infantry also began to move out behind the smoke screen.</p>
<p>To prevent a central breakthrough and to avoid being bombarded by the Northern Army's anti-tank guns or landmines, the Southern Army's tanks, led by a team, launched a fierce attack on the Northern Army's left flank from the right wing. The light and low tanks quickly broke through a corner of the Northern Army's position. The defending soldiers on the front line immediately scattered to both sides, and furiously attacked the tanks with hand-held stones. Although the assault of the light tanks was slightly stalled, dozens of XX-ton XX-type electric tanks of the Southern Army changed to a horizontal formation, thundering with engines of 100,000 horsepower, and continued to cover the infantry, coming with earth-shaking force. The endless tracks crushed the ditches, broke the trees, and broke through the barbed wire... Almost the entire battlefield was changed. The XXX guns on the tanks continuously bombarded, and the machine guns also frantically spat out tongues of fire, fiercely strafing the resisting Northern Army. Ten minutes later, the Northern Army's left flank retreated while fighting due to heavy casualties. The radio operator in the Southern Army's tank received the commander's order to return to the original formation, pass through the XX mountain road, detour behind the XXX height, and pursue forward, attempting to break through the Northern Army's main position in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The Northern Army's complete and deep defensive position was beyond the Southern Army's expectations. Anti-tank guns fired armor-piercing shells at the Southern Army's tanks as soon as they entered the effective range. The first tank (made of wood) caught fire, and one of the following tanks got stuck in a parallel anti-tank trench pre-set by the Northern Army, making it difficult to move forward or backward. The drivers and gunners in the tank took up their guns and left the tank, falling into bitter fighting. Another tank was damaged by a landmine while avoiding the concentrated fire (live ammunition) of infantry machine guns and was captured. The Southern Army's tank team suffered this loss, and the offensive was stalled. The infantry's morale was completely lost, and they generally showed a fear of moving forward.</p>
<p>After receiving accurate reports from the front, the Northern Army's commander decided to launch a counterattack decisively. He ordered XX light and heavy tanks disguised to enter the position to counterattack the Southern Army, which had broken through the position, in coordination with the second-line infantry. At this time, the left flank of the Southern Army was using a XX force to seize another height to the right and rear of the XXX height, and the Northern Army's situation reached a critical juncture. The first to occur was a fierce bayonet fight. Both armies charged with bayonets (wooden guns), and the sound of shouting shook the fields. Because reinforcements could not keep up, the Southern Army in that direction was ultimately wiped out.</p>
<p>Although the number of tanks in the Northern Army was only a quarter of that of the Southern Army, because of the fierce fighting spirit and the very close coordination between the tanks and the infantry in the counterattack, compared to the Southern Army, which relied on tanks as fortresses and regarded infantry as a burden, it finally managed to defeat the many with the few and drove south. After four hours of counterattack, the Northern Army restored the original position before dawn that day.</p>
<p>"Attack is the best defense." The Northern Army, knowing that the Southern Army was newly recruited, decided to strike the strikers and annihilate the enemy in front of its own position. The Northern Army's artillery, far to the north of XX Town, began to carry out annihilation fire on the Southern Army with XX-type heavy artillery. This new weapon made it impossible for the various arms of the Southern Army to fight back, and they all collapsed. At the observation post, the commander of the Northern Army's artillery then ordered an extension of the range, and coordinated with tanks and infantry to pursue the fleeing enemy.</p>
<p>The bright moon came to the middle of the sky again, and the Northern Army's counterattack was successful. The Southern Army escaped. In the rehearsal of the tracer bullets that made up the flames, the red and green light devices covered the pre-exercise field with a mesh of wires. The officers and soldiers of the grand exercise, as well as every officer and soldier participating in the exercise, sincerely expressed a kind of beautiful and pleasant mood. Everyone was convinced that the Chinese army has been modernized, and it has the strong power to strike the strikers and annihilate the enemy in front of its own position! Guilin, June 10, 1939.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Two Months of War Record in Fushan <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Draft News from Minge News Agency] Since the end of last year, the general strategy of the Japanese troops in Shanxi has changed to a new strategy of "changing from lines to surfaces and gradually expanding," taking the Tongpu Railway as the base, gradually encroaching to the left and right. This is ironclad proof that the Japanese troops know that they cannot completely "sweep" Shanxi.</p>
<p>Fushan and Anze counties, whose western parts border Hongdong and Linfen counties, have a flat terrain and are one of the few plains in Shanxi. In order to consolidate the occupation of Hongdong and Linfen and reduce the threat of our occasional attacks, the Japanese invaders had to further seize the western parts of the two counties. This was the primary reason for the Japanese invaders' attack on Fushan.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese invaders repeatedly attacked our southeastern Shanxi base area, and suffered heavy blows and repeated failures, their "sweeping" attempts have never been abandoned, only with a change in strategy. They attempted to seize several important strongholds from the periphery of the base area, gradually compress, and gradually reduce the scope of our base area's activities. This was another attempt by the Japanese invaders to attack Fushan.</p>
<p>After seizing Fushan, they could further cross the Taiyue Mountains and attack Shangdang, while going north could attack Anze, and going south could threaten Qingshui. This was the final attempt of the Japanese invaders. In order to defend the southeastern Shanxi base area, we must not ignore the importance of the highlands in the Taiyue Mountains in terms of strategy. "We would rather abandon the county seat than lose the East Mountain." Before the outbreak of war, we completely moved the people, young men, gentry, and elders in the city to the East Mountain area. One reason was that there was no need to defend the county seat to the death, and another reason was to avoid the senseless sacrifice of the people. In this way, the Japanese were given an empty city. For two months, they could not even find talents to organize a maintenance association, so what gains could they have?</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders began their attack on February 17, which was exactly during the days of the Lunar New Year's Eve. The Japanese invaders were convinced that they had seized an excellent opportunity to do whatever they wanted, but they did not expect what time it was. At this time, our military deployment was as follows: In the area of Qubian and the northwest near Hongdong in Linfen, our Independent Brigade XX Regiment and the local guerrilla brigade were in defense. The main force was stationed in the Nanbeihan Village area (more than 20 miles west of the city). In the south and southeast connecting Linfen and Yicheng, the XX Corps was in defense. Another main force was stationed at the intersection of Linfen and Fushan... The troops of the XX Corps were stationed in the Nanpan Bridge area, 29 miles south of the city (more than 30 miles southwest), and the XX Regiment of the XX Corps was equipped to defend the East Mountain area 40 miles east of the city. The main force was stationed around Sanjiao Village, 50 miles east of the city.</p>
<p>This was a pre-planned deployment aimed at the Japanese invaders' "how to attack," and the facts also proved the accuracy of this prediction. The Japanese invaders began to invade in two routes, one route attacking Dayang and Guanque east from Linfen, and the other route going north from Shanyi City, then dividing into three groups, attacking Yanli and Nanpan Bridge. The combined infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces reached more than 3,000, with more than 10 artillery pieces and more than 40 vehicles, adopting a strategy of simultaneous advance and joint attack to directly attack Fushan.</p>
<p>From Linfen, attacking XX eastward, the XX turned to the rear of XX. On the morning of the 17th, it fired simultaneously with the XX Brigade and infiltrated Yichuan that night. At the same time, from Yicheng to Yanli XX, it began to engage in combat, with artillery and machine guns infiltrating with a roundabout strategy. We bravely counterattacked, and counterattacked the southeastern direction to contain the XX line, blocking the advance of the Japanese. The next morning, Guan XX again attacked Hancun fiercely, firing fiercely with artillery and machine guns. We immediately moved to the vicinity of the suburbs, and the same withdrawal was made from Yanli. The few remaining people in the city, helping the old and carrying the young, all fled to the mountains. Our troops in the city could not immediately abandon the county seat, and had to cover the evacuation of the people first. In one day and one night, after several fierce battles, our main force fought to the death and resisted, and would never retreat. At dawn on the 19th, the city was already "completely empty." Our side was very skillful in combat and moved to the east area.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly stated that the 40-mile ridge is important geographically and militarily, and has therefore become the last target for the Japanese to seize and conquer. In early March, the Japanese invaders continued to increase their forces by more than 1,000 infantry and artillery from Linfen, preparing to actively attack the East Mountain. We also transferred the two regiments of the XX Division from Qingshui to reinforce. On the morning of the 3rd, most of our reinforcements had advanced to the southeast of the 40-mile ridge, and the vanguard had advanced to Yaomiao Mountain, five miles southeast of the city.</p>
<p>The most intense, fierce, and important was the battle on March 9. In the week following the Battle of Yaomiao Mountain, both our and the Japanese sides had been actively deploying. "We are willing to do our utmost to fight for this last 'critical moment' of life and death." This was the heroic saying of the XX Regiment and XX soldiers, and the so-called "critical moment" refers to the Dongshan 40-mile ridge.</p>
<p>The weather was gloomy and the sun was not visible, and the thick fog in the early morning was still lingering. Early in the morning, more than 500 Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked Dongyaodun, 20 miles east of the city. The two regiments launched a fierce attack, and the two regiments of strong soldiers immediately joined forces to meet the attack, killing more than 80 Japanese. In the fierce battle to 10 o'clock, a Japanese detachment went around Dongdaqiao "because the bridge was destroyed by us" and attempted to pounce directly on the 40-mile ridge from Shanpo Village. At that time, our guerrilla detachment had been completely deployed on the ridge, and began to fire fiercely when the Japanese advanced to a considerable distance. The fog that had not completely dispersed hindered the clear sight of both sides, and they only managed to fire in the direction of the artillery and gun sounds. After a stalemate of three hours, our XX regimental commander saw that the bullets were about to run out, and suddenly rushed to the front line, shouting, "Certain company of certain battalion, fix bayonets! Advance!" For a time, the sounds of kill! kill! filled the mountain valley, and the fire of hand grenades ignited on the hillside. The Japanese invaders did not know what was going on, only assumed that reinforcements had arrived, and were just starting to be suspicious! From the front and southeast, suddenly a burst of gunfire pressed close. The Japanese invaders were exhausted and unable to fight again, and fled to the west. After our army's victory, it was understood that it was the XX Regiment that had come to help. They happily counted the enemy's bodies, which numbered more than 120.</p>
<p>Looking at Fushan City from the bottom, it was just like a target for our artillery on the East Mountain. On the evening of the 17th, we fired at the city from time to time, and all the Japanese invaders moved out of the city overnight, crossing the large ditch in the west gate to garrison. Although this was not a withdrawal, it was to avoid our threat.</p>
<p>This was the situation of the Japanese invaders' attack on Fushan for one month. The East Mountain that they attempted to seize not only never fell into their hands, but became our strong fortress because of our active defense, frequent sorties, and the excitement of the soldiers and the animosity of the people. At the same time, we have gained the initiative and strategy in the military, and can give the Japanese invaders a great threat. From the end of March to the beginning of April, although the Japanese invaders had reorganized their forces to attack the East Mountain several times, they always failed. Their final attempt will never be realized!</p>

<h3 id="e16">Soviet Counterproposal Delivered. British and French Exchange Views. Baltic Sea Still the Key Issue. British Newspaper Advocates Guarantee. <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Pessimism has arisen among local sources today regarding the future of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which was not present in the past. The French Cabinet held a meeting to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] The French State Council convened a meeting where Foreign Minister Bonnet reported that France had signed an agreement with Turkey and issued a mutual assistance declaration. Bilateral relations will be based on mutual trust, entering a new era of cooperation to maintain peace in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. Regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov submitted a counterproposal to the Anglo-French suggestions yesterday. Currently, the British and French governments are exchanging views on this matter. Essentially, the current issue is of great importance and extremely complex in nature. All clauses are subject to negotiation, so the slow progress of the negotiations is not surprising. The British and French governments are continuing their efforts to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Observer" newspaper's diplomatic correspondent stated that while the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Moscow have been delayed for a long time and have not been completed, it is incorrect to say that the hope of concluding the agreement is less strong than before. Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have all expressed a shared interest. The main point of contention remains the guarantee of Baltic countries that refuse to accept an agreement. The Soviet defense argues that whether or not the Baltic states are willing to be guaranteed is irrelevant. The purpose of the agreement is to defeat German aggression. German aggression against the Baltic states is essentially an indirect aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, regardless of whether the Baltic states are willing to be guaranteed, the Anglo-Soviet agreement will protect them. This is not for the benefit of the Baltic states, but for the benefit of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union themselves.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 24th] According to reports in this morning's newspapers, British Foreign Secretary Halifax is personally intervening in the negotiations with the Soviet Union. This is based on a long meeting Halifax held with the Soviet Ambassador to Britain. It is said that Halifax strongly sought a resolution to the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states during the meeting and expressed the British government's hope that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Moscow could be completed quickly. The "Daily Express" stated that the hope for a quick and effective conclusion to the Anglo-Soviet negotiations could be realized in an instant. However, the "Times" newspaper's diplomatic correspondent today wrote about the current situation of the Moscow negotiations, considering it "very disappointing." The newspaper said that Britain has tried its best to accommodate the Soviet Union's demands and now only hopes for some concessions from the Soviet side. "Both countries want the agreement to be concluded, but further concessions depend on the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Italy Resents Franco-Turkish Agreement</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 24th] Italian newspapers criticized France's transfer of the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey, expressing extreme indignation, considering it "a violation of the mandate system and a hostile act towards Italy." The "Popolo d'Italia" further compared France's favorable treatment of Turkey with the French government's repeated responses of "impossible" to Italy's demands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 24th] Italy is very dissatisfied with the signing of the mutual assistance pact between France and Turkey. Because Turkey is united with various democracies, and given the possibility of an agreement with Egypt, Turkey may assist Egypt in defending the Suez Canal if a war occurs in the Mediterranean in the future. If so, Axis warships will not be able to pass through the Dardanelles Strait, nor will they be able to sail into the Red Sea. This is a matter of extreme resentment for Italy, which is launching a large-scale diplomatic offensive, the target of which is the Balkan Peninsula, especially Bulgaria. As for the Arabian Peninsula, the Arab nations are extremely dissatisfied after the British government published the White Paper on the Palestine issue, making it easy to incite them. Regarding Bulgaria, Italy is inciting the country to demand the return of lost territories from Romania and Greece, the Dobruja region, and the Greek Macedonian region, all of which belonged to Bulgaria before the European War. Italian newspapers are currently filled with articles and propaganda on this issue, claiming that Bulgaria will not be able to recover its lost territories unless it follows the Axis powers. As for the Arabian Peninsula, the various Arab nations are frequently interacting with the Axis authorities. The Italian side is very optimistic about the future and believes that the difficulties Britain is encountering in the Far East will inevitably affect Britain's attitude towards the Near Eastern Arabs.</p>
<p>Britain Thoroughly Investigates Submarine Incident</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Judge Bucknill, responsible for investigating the 'Thetis' submarine disaster, visited the submarine command at Gosport today to inspect a demonstration of the use of the "Davis" escape apparatus to understand the details. The demonstration was held in a large onyx tank. The bottom of the tank contained a waterproof compartment and an indicator tower. Several performers wearing swimsuits and equipped with "Davis" escape apparatuses entered the compartment. After the compartment was flooded, Bucknill was able to see the people inside rising sequentially through the glass, as would actually be done in the event of a submarine accident. Then Judge Bucknill visited the Portsmouth dockyard and inspected the 'Triton', sister ship of the 'Thetis', in detail.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Paris, 24th) Today, the State Council discussed the situation in the Far East. Foreign Minister Bonnet solemnly declared the unity of Britain and France, especially in dealing with the situation in Tianjin. He also said that London is still waiting to know exactly what the Japanese government's true intentions are. Therefore, the British government has not notified the French government of any specific retaliation plans. The French government, in view of the recent attitude expressed by the US government, hopes that this matter can be resolved locally.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a speech at the State Council meeting yesterday, stating that Britain and France are completely interdependent in the Far East, especially regarding the Tianjin incident. The British government has not presented a concrete plan for retaliation against Japan to the French government because the British government is currently exploring Japan's intentions. The Foreign Minister continued that he personally hopes that the problem can be resolved locally.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Diplomatic sources believe that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has notified the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, of the British government's dissatisfaction with Japan's actions in the most frank terms. The "Daily Express" prominently published the following estimate: that only 15,000 British expatriates in China are likely to be harassed by Japan, while Japanese people under the protection of the British Empire number as many as 50,000. The "Times" newspaper's Washington correspondent said that the United States has repeatedly tolerated the Japanese discrimination against foreigners and all kinds of arrogant actions, but there are signs that it cannot continue to tolerate them indefinitely.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Observer" stated today that whatever the outcome of Japan's provocative behavior, we can definitely say that this matter will not be limited to Britain and Japan. Patience is still the reasonable course of action because a response to such a serious event cannot be decided in a short period of time. Effective action should be jointly discussed and decided by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th) The London Times on the 24th commented again on the Japanese blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. It stated that British expatriates in the concession must be protected from serious insults by the Japanese. There are many Japanese people residing in British territory, especially in Singapore. The British authorities are treating the Japanese with a civilized attitude, but if the Japanese government does not understand diplomatic language, then Britain must take actions against Japan that are more easily understood by Japan.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] The State Department recently released a report stating that Japan has effectively implemented a wartime economy. The production, import prices, and distribution of various goods in the country are almost entirely managed by the government. The entire economic structure has therefore lost its equilibrium. In order to maintain parity, the country limits imports to essential goods, and the quantity is also limited to what is sufficient. Its exports have declined compared to before.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 25th] The Romanian delegation came here and has been conducting financial negotiations with the British authorities for many days. An agreement has now been concluded and will be formally signed. Britain will provide a credit loan of £5,500,000 to Romania, with an annual interest rate of 5% and a repayment period of 20 years. According to British government officials, the conclusion of this agreement is sufficient to strengthen the anti-aggression front. Romania can thereby purchase needed military equipment and aviation materials. If necessary in the future, Britain will provide Romania with another large loan. However, this depends on the outcome of the financial negotiations between Britain and Poland. It is said that Poland wants to borrow 60 million pounds from Britain, and Britain may be able to lend that amount.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 25th] The British-French Joint Defense Conference in Singapore closed today. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, who personally chaired the conference, is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the 26th. It is reported that the storage of strategic military raw materials, the thorough investigation of manpower and material resources, and the issue of the allocation of British and French forces were all decided at yesterday's meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 24th] The joint defense conference held by British and French military authorities in Singapore requires about one more meeting before it can be closed. Today's meeting discussed the status of Siam. According to reports, Siam had previously notified the conference that the country would maintain a neutral stance. However, once a war breaks out, it is questionable whether Thailand will be able to maintain neutrality. It is reported that the Dutch authorities are also extremely attentive to the development of the British-French joint defense conference. The Dutch government may even exchange views informally with the British and French authorities. The British and French officers attending this conference are scheduled to visit Singapore's naval and air force bases and fortifications.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, The Hague, 24th] Rumors that the Netherlands will send representatives to Singapore to participate in the conference of British and French naval authorities stationed in the Far East must be officially denied.

<h3 id="e25">Americans Enthusiastically Discuss Embargoing Arms Shipments to Japan. Necessary for Ourselves and Others. British Ship Carrying Scrap Metal Blocked in the US <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] The issue of the United States banning the shipment of arms to Japan has been enthusiastically discussed by political figures for a long time, and even more so since the recent incidents in the Far East. The reasons for the change in the American mentality regarding this issue can be stated in three aspects. The first belongs to the moral aspect. According to recent official statistics, Japanese arms purchases from foreign countries, those from the United States account for 57%. A portion of the public opinion is quite uneasy, and they are all asking whether the United States is indirectly responsible for Japan's continued aggression against China. The second belongs to the economic aspect. According to reports received by the State Department, Japan's recent offensives against foreign concessions in China are actually aimed at Chinese legal tender, with the intention of preventing legal tender from circulating in the occupied areas. Since the United States has lent China 50 million US dollars to assist in maintaining the status of legal tender, it is inconvenient to turn a blind eye to this kind of erosion by Japan. The third is in terms of interests. The general view is that after Japan erodes Chinese interests, its goals are expanding day by day, first attacking the Soviet Union, not supplying China with arms, then accusing France of supplying China through French Indochina, and now launching offensives against British concessions in China. At this moment, although the United States is not directly harmed by the Tianjin incident, the impact of Japan's actions on American interests is only a matter of time. Although the United States is not convenient to use force to stop this kind of action that infringes on the interests of various countries, it would be a proper way to stop supplying Japan with weapons of war. However, in order to prohibit the shipment of arms to Japan, President Roosevelt must first declare the existence of a state of war between China and Japan before he can issue a decree. Weighing this aspect of the current Neutrality Act, although it is sufficient to strike at Japan, the impact on China, which is being invaded, will certainly not be less than that on the aggressor. The reason why President Roosevelt did not announce the embargo method is for this reason. Under these circumstances, only the method of economic sanctions can still be implemented. American experts are currently studying it. There is a precedent to follow in this matter. After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the United States imposed an additional tax of 25% on goods imported from Germany to show its punishment. Today, the same method may be replicated for Japan. Public opinion's angry psychology towards Japan is increasing day by day, which is also enough to facilitate the government's actions. Although some isolationists have expressed concern, saying that this move may drag the United States into the vortex of war, in fact, Japan's economic and military situation is becoming increasingly difficult. According to the report released by the Foreign Policy Association today, if the country participates in a major war, its remaining gold will inevitably be exhausted in no time, and thus suffer a great crisis. It is far more serious than the current predicament that the country is facing. Based on this, the claim that the United States will be dragged into the vortex of war is merely alarmist talk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tacoma, Washington, 24th] The British cargo ship "Brimington" recently transported scrap iron to Japan, but members of the American committee that did not participate in Japan's aggression, organized dockworkers to remove the scrap iron from the ship, causing the cargo ship to remain anchored here to this day, unable to sail out.</p>
<p>Dr. Pirow Doesn't Know What He's Talking About</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] South African Minister of Defense Dr. Pirow said in a speech today that South Africa and Tanganyika can never be returned to Germany. However, if the other colonial claims are not recognized, then hope for peace is difficult.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said, referring to Dr. Pirow's speech, "Germany will absolutely not tolerate any so-called 'compensation problems'." What Germany demands is the return of its original colonies. Only when this demand is met will Germany participate in discussions on the overall distribution of colonies. At the same time, Britain and France must also hand over their colonies for redistribution.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Emergency Epidemic Prevention <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The cholera epidemic is spreading faster in Hong Kong. The authorities have decided to take emergency measures, increasing the number of street cleaners by 200 and garbage trucks by five. They have also opened the Lai Chi Kok Infectious Diseases Hospital to accommodate patients, and are working hard to publicize and instill epidemic prevention knowledge in residents. For the safety of the general public, this is a great virtue. However, these methods alone seem to be a drop in the bucket. In order to be truly thorough, on the one hand, newspapers, schools, and community groups should be mobilized to expand epidemic prevention publicity. On the other hand, all "popular" food products should be carefully inspected, and necessary guidance and practical assistance should be provided to achieve a clean-up movement in poor streets and alleys. Of course, the main thing is to find ways to help the vast poor residents, especially by lowering rents and prices, and opening up avenues for ordinary people to make a living! In a society, if there continues to be a majority of citizens who are hungry, homeless, and without medical care, then all epidemics will never be eradicated! Therefore, we cannot help but hope that the wealthy will generously donate.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Honor of the Literati <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to reports on the recent situation of literary writers, it was mentioned that Mr. Zhu Xiuxia served as the acting magistrate of Taiping County in Guangdong at the beginning of this year, and his political achievements are quite good, with the reputation of a model county magistrate in Guangdong. However, because he was "too serious" in eradicating local malpractices, he was not tolerated by the local evil forces and has already "hung up his official hat" and left. When we see this news, on the one hand, we certainly have a feeling that "it is difficult to be a good person," but on the other hand, we are always grateful to Mr. Zhu for ultimately winning a lot of glory for the literati.</p>
<p>We are used to seeing those wavering elements, stubborn elements, narrow-minded, selfish, and ignorant literati of the country and society, one by one, revealing their true colors in front of the crucible of the War of Resistance, running to the doors of the × people and even the jackals of the × people, shamelessly praising Yao, barking incessantly. It is truly a mixture of grief and anger. Today, when we hear that Mr. Zhu "hangs up his official hat" in a dignified manner under the evil forces, not only does he retain his clean body, but he also makes the tens of millions of literati with backbone and enthusiasm exhale and raise their eyebrows, making those shameless people see it and die of shame!</p>
<p>Although we cannot help but seriously point out here: Mr. Zhu's "hanging up his official hat" is to avoid unnecessary friction and increase the difficulties of the War of Resistance and national construction. However, Mr. Zhu's "hanging up his official hat" also exposes that at this time when the War of Resistance has entered a new and difficult stage, all corrupt and evil forces have begun to raise their heads again! Therefore, the significance of Mr. Zhu's "hanging up his official hat" lies in raising our vigilance and increasing our responsibility!</p>
<h3 id="e28">Behind the Scenes of Downing Street: A Glimpse into British Policy (Part Two) <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>Similarly, behind the scenes of the Italian political stage, there is also a pivotal female figure: Mussolini's eldest daughter, Ciano's wife, Edda. This Miss Edda certainly has considerable influence in Rome. It goes without saying that Ciano's career advancement was orchestrated by her. Even Mussolini often listens to and follows her advice. It is said that once, Mussolini convened a meeting in the morning, and Ciano was half an hour late. That afternoon, Ciano received a gift from his father-in-law: a dozen alarm clocks. This obviously embarrassed the son-in-law, but Miss Edda immediately returned the gift with a note attached, which read: "Grasso accompanied me dancing last night." The next day, when the father-in-law and son-in-law met, they exchanged a knowing smile.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's wife is a close friend of Miss Edda. She also has a considerable friendship with Mussolini. She owns a magnificent villa in Rome, where she spends more than half of the year's 360 days. Every weekend, it is the place where Rome's diplomats can indulge in pleasure to their heart's content.</p>
<p>Even before her deceased husband passed away, she was already engaged in diplomatic activities between Britain and Italy. In 1934, she strongly advocated for the Stresa Front, an alliance of Britain, France, Italy, and Austria, to encircle Germany. Last year's Anglo-Italian Agreement was even more a result of her and Edda's joint efforts. Chamberlain's single-minded focus on befriending Italy, attempting to dismantle the German-Italian axis, was also her sister-in-law's proposition.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>With the same style as Chamberlain's wife, and even more dazzling, is the Marquess of Londonderry. This Marquess, who is fifty-nine years old this year, is an Irish landowner and a thorough conservative. He possesses extensive latent power on the British political stage. In West London, he has a spacious residence, which has become a gateway for those seeking advancement. Every year, after the summer recess of the British Parliament ends, the Marquess and his wife always hold grand banquets in this private residence, attended by officials from the Prime Minister downwards. This banquet has now become a barometer for measuring the rise and fall of the Marquess's power.</p>
<p>The Marquess has unusually rich experience in his official career. He first rose to prominence in the Irish government. In 1931, he formally served as Secretary of State for Air in the rebel MacDonald cabinet. MacDonald's shift in stance was also significantly related to the Marquess. When MacDonald resigned, his successor, Baldwin, was relatively liberal and did not get along well with the Marquess. When he discovered that Germany's frontline aircraft had reached four thousand and its production rate was twice as fast as Britain's, he angrily dismissed the Marquess. Thus, for two years, 1935 and 1936, there were no banquets at the Marquess's residence.</p>
<p>In 1937, Baldwin was forced out of office, Edward VIII abdicated, and Baldwin also stepped down to apologize to the nation. Chamberlain's thorough conservatism brought good fortune to the Marquess again. He is now the Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal.</p>
<p>Although the Marquess of Londonderry has the same style as Chamberlain's wife, he is not pro-Italian, but pro-German—an Italian ally. It is not known whether the Marquess has any specific personal relationship with Hitler, but he has a close friendship with Ribbentrop. Long before Ribbentrop was Hitler's advisor, they had already become friends. Later, when Ribbentrop was sent to London as ambassador, he spent almost every day in the Marquess's residence.</p>
<p>In name, the Marquess of Londonderry also officially holds the position of Chairman of the "Anglo-German Fellowship." The true purpose of this society is not clear. Its stated aim is: "To promote friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Britain and Germany."</p>
<p>This Marquess goes to Germany for "sightseeing" at least once a year. When Hitler was pressing Czechoslovakia most urgently last autumn, he had just returned from a "private visit" to Germany and reported to Chamberlain that Germany had six thousand frontline aircraft and could turn London into ruins within 24 hours. This was intolerable. Chamberlain understood in his heart that it was best to yield and sacrifice a little ××'s territory.</p>
<p>During the Czech crisis this spring, although Chamberlain repeatedly claimed that he knew nothing about it and was completely fooled by Hitler, the honest Halifax admitted in the House of Lords that as early as March 11, two days before the Czech crisis, the British government had already obtained intelligence that German troops were concentrated on the Czech border. Naturally, this intelligence was also delivered by the Marquess of Londonderry. The conclusion of his report probably included these two sentences: Germany has seven thousand frontline aircraft and can turn London into ruins within 12 hours. In this situation, Chamberlain naturally had no choice but to draft a statement of painful ×× and weeping ××.</p>
<p>Many people call the Marquess of Londonderry Chamberlain's "Friday," but in fact, this is not accurate. "Friday" was merely a servant who worked for Robinson Crusoe, while the Marquess is a person who influences Chamberlain's policies.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Chamberlain has many "brains." Mrs. Chamberlain and the Marquess of Londonderry mentioned here are representatives among them. Their inclinations are precisely the opposite of public opinion, pulling Chamberlain backward and pushing him to the right.</p>
<p>Of course, we understand very well that Chamberlain's policies are not entirely determined by this group of "brains." Similarly, we also believe that Chamberlain will not truly embark on the path of fascism because of the prodding of this group of "brains." However, with this group of "brains" surrounding him, it is truly wishful thinking to expect Chamberlain to eradicate the policy of appeasement. Therefore, Chamberlain came up with a good idea: to take a two-pronged approach, on the one hand, discussing with Hitler and asking him to go east to launch an "anti-communist" war; on the other hand, "fraternizing" with Stalin to act as a backing to intimidate Hitler. This is also called a "half-measure policy."</p>
<p>This statement is not to say that the current Anglo-Soviet negotiations will not succeed. If British and world public opinion pushes a little more, and the Soviet Union is willing to make some concessions, the Anglo-Soviet agreement can be signed. But what is the use? The self-serving British have as little regard for treaties as Hitler does; especially Mr. Chamberlain, who is skilled in the art of breaking promises. Didn't Chamberlain issue a statement in April guaranteeing Britain's support for Poland? What about now? A British Foreign Office spokesman said: "Britain will allow Poland to freely dispose of the issue of Danzig and the Corridor, without interference." This is very clear, which means: "Mr. Hitler, if you can use some skills to deceive Poland, we can also turn a blind eye."</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to expect Chamberlain to establish an anti-aggression front to stop aggression. At best, it is only delaying the outbreak of aggression. And Chamberlain's fate has also reached the stage of procrastination. In the near future, we will eventually see his downfall.</p>

<p>A member of the Shanghai White Russian Volunteer Corps, named Trifonov, invited six companions to set off from Shanghai in a sailing ship, the "Vistula," planning to cross the Pacific Ocean to Holland. Unfortunately, when passing through Japan, they were "invited" by the Japanese military police to be guests and suffered all kinds of torment. The following is his confessional letter:</p>
<p>On the fourth day of our yacht's departure from Shanghai, unfortunately, we encountered a severe storm and the ship was damaged. In order to repair it as soon as possible, we had to land on the small island of Aoyama near Taiwan. As soon as we landed, Japanese military police ran over to question us. We requested a passing steamship to tow the yacht into the harbor, but they ignored us and instead detained us, claiming we were spies from Britain and America. We hurriedly took the news cut from the Shanghai North-China Daily News about the yacht's departure from Shanghai and showed it to them. That was just adding insult to injury! After reading it, they glared at us and said, "It's ridiculous to have sailed six hundred nautical miles in four days!"</p>
<p>From then on, that well-equipped yacht no longer belonged to us. We let the vendors take everything from the ship, so that all the canned goods and the complete set of cooking utensils were lost. Later, I learned that even the police officers each received a generous share.</p>
<p>The military police also forced us to exchange all our US dollars for Japanese yen. One US dollar was only exchanged for two Japanese yen. Before long, they had squeezed us dry. Then, without hesitation, they disposed of our clothes, leather shoes, watches, each item fetching a price ranging from one to three Japanese yen, until we were completely destitute. Once it rained, and pitifully, the police had no raincoats and came to "borrow" from us. Naturally, the raincoats were gone forever once borrowed. "Borrowing" seemed to be very common. As long as we had something and had just exchanged it for some money, we didn't have to worry about someone coming to "borrow" it.</p>
<p>We were interrogated several times during our two months there, and we suffered several slaps and punches in the face. Later, the authorities decided to send us to Nacha Port near Japan and imprison us with Japanese prisoners. Day and night, those Japanese prisoners were called out, and we could only hear the sounds of their shouts from afar. It was said that they were being interrogated. If the guards fell asleep, the prisoners would sing the songs of the Third International in a low voice, and the whole cell would respond.</p>
<p>After being detained for four months, the authorities were unwilling to support us any longer, because we had become a burden to them. At this time, we were penniless and could only plan to sell the yacht. The ship had not been taken care of for four months, the propeller of the screw engine was broken, and the motor was completely out of order. Who would want to buy it? However, we had to leave.</p>
<p>We were only allowed to write letters a week before we left Japan. One of our companions was Polish, and he reported the difficult situation to the Polish consul in Tokyo, requesting relief. This letter was checked and inspected repeatedly. Then, we were informed that our previous "lodging fees and all other expenses were paid by the Japanese government on our behalf, and must be repaid in full when the money from the Polish consul was received."</p>
<p>Soon, the Polish consul wrote back, saying that whatever amount was needed would be paid immediately. Upon learning of this, the Japanese authorities hurriedly added another charge of the yacht entering a restricted area without permission, and imposed a fine of 300 Japanese yen. At the same time, knowing that three of us were performers, they ordered them to perform in the theater. After a few days, according to our calculations, we could earn more than 300 Japanese yen. However, on the day of payment, after settlement, not only did we not receive a penny, but we also owed the theater 29 yen. This meant that the longer we worked hard, the more debt we would owe. This was truly Japanese arithmetic. We were allocated two yen per day for food, but this was only enough to buy some sweet potatoes, flour, and a little bit of lard. We couldn't even afford tobacco.</p>
<p>Performing for several days only caused us to lose our last remaining clothes. The Polish ambassador negotiated with the Japanese Foreign Ministry on our behalf. The Japanese Foreign Ministry promised to recover our lost items. However, when we returned to the yacht, three barrels of water were missing from the five barrels, and the newly purchased cups, plates, pots, cans, cooking utensils, and commemorative albums had all disappeared.</p>
<p>We spent 70 Japanese yen to tidy up the yacht, but it was not fully repaired, but it was enough to make it sail away from this Japanese "paradise."</p>
<p>Now, thank God, we have arrived in the Philippines and are preparing to sail to Australia. For some reason, the people of the Philippines make us feel particularly polite and amiable.</p>

<p>During the Jin Dynasty, Mr. Tao Yuanming was not very successful as an official. After writing a "Returning Home" poem, he retired to his hometown and enjoyed himself with poetry and wine. Thinking that "the fields were about to be overgrown," he planted some peach trees in his small garden. Mr. Tao was indeed an unparalleled writer and poet, but he had no research in botany. He saw that the peach trees in the Taoist priest's garden across the street were very lush. Especially when the peaches were ripe, the ones sent over to taste were not only fresh and sweet, but also had no pits inside. This was a great threat to Mr. Tao's peaches. So, Mr. Tao was not ashamed to ask and went to inquire about the reason. How could he know that the Taoist priest was being secretive: "This is a magical method of the immortals." Mr. Tao had never prayed to the immortals, so naturally he had no "method" to use.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao knew that the Taoist priest liked to eat braised pork hock. One day, Mr. Tao opened the "often closed" door and invited the Taoist priest to come over for a drink and a chat.</p>
<p>As soon as they were seated, a servant bought a pig's hock.</p>
<p>"This is perfect for my appetite," the Taoist priest thought. "Unfortunately, it's still raw now. It won't be tender enough when I eat it later."</p>
<p>Before long, a large plate of braised pork hock was brought to the table. It was fresh, delicious, and tender, which made the Taoist priest have to ask.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tao, how did you cook this hock so quickly?"</p>
<p>"This is also a magical method of my family," Mr. Tao also began to be secretive. "However, if you are willing, we can exchange 'immortal methods.' You tell me about the peaches."</p>
<p>The Taoist priest immediately agreed: "The method for my peaches is very simple. Just remove a stamen inside when the flower blooms."</p>
<p>"My method is even simpler. I just ask my family to prepare one the night before, isn't that enough?"</p>

It's really unexpected that Hong Kong, with its beautiful mountains and clear waters, would have such a dark side. We hope that this can be properly resolved. However, we still don't understand, who is eating the big beggars?</p>
<p>Mysterious cases are the most interesting news, and Hong Kong people are also most fortunate to enjoy them. There is another "suspicious murder and abandonment of a corpse in a well" in Kowloon. The truth is indistinguishable, and the police authorities are once again displaying their detective skills. Let's wait for good news to come.</p>

<p>— Written by Captain Lauton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Articles</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kailunboqi" was carrying six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Qiukes Shipping Company, and the mechanic Changbi'er also took this ship to travel around Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship ran wildly without a destination. Soon, another message came from the radio that there were icebergs nearby. Fortunately, the iceberg soon slid past, but the passengers were frightened and went crazy, causing a scene. Soon, another British warship came to intercept and opened fire...</p>
<p>Seven The Stern Was Hit</p>
<p>"Oh!" Hayes Bauer sighed, "Maybe we've been hit!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, another puff of smoke emerged over there, flying quickly, emitting fire, and another loud sound came. However, this time, accompanying the sound was also the sound of steel cracking, and the ship shook, as if it had hit a reef.</p>
<p>"The rear smokestack," Jack shouted, pointing to the hole blown in the smokestack.</p>
<p>"The next one will definitely be closer," Bill gasped, almost trembling.</p>
<p>On the deck below, there was simply earth-shattering chaos. Women fainted. Some attendants and junior staff tried their best to maintain the terrified people. The cannon hit the smokestack, which made them even more anxious and hateful. Representatives went to the captain again, demanding that the ship be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Before the representatives reached the framework, they met a staff member on the stairs. He politely told them that the captain did not have any room for discussion about stopping the ship.</p>
<p>The third shot was louder and closer, but it flew over their heads.</p>
<p>"I don't believe they are really firing at this ship, maybe they just want to threaten the captain to stop the ship." Jack said.</p>
<p>"Looking at it this way," Bill also agreed with this, "maybe it's a threat, I guess they will win. Like now, everyone is worried except the captain and his men."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, that cruiser is what everyone wants." Rummonggaro said:</p>
<p>"That's right, but look, another one is coming." Jack suddenly shouted, pointing behind him, "That must be the one that Bauer heard the 'Vebok' communicating with."</p>
<p>"We are under attack from both sides," Bill said, "I wish that idiot captain would stop the ship quickly and let them take the gold and the Germans."</p>
<p>They all stood there trembling, waiting for the cruiser to fire again. Jack suddenly shouted again.</p>
<p>"Look, what's ahead! We still have a glimmer of hope."</p>
<p>In front of them, the mist was slowly building a barrier on the sunlit water.</p>
<p>"Fog!" Er cried happily.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's not thick enough for us." Garo said.</p>
<p>"Captain Locke may have seen this coming, so he refused to stop the ship." Jack said, "Of course, if we knew this was coming, we wouldn't be so flustered."</p>

<h3 id="e36">Substitute Vouchers Postponed, New Subsidiary Coins from the Ministry of Finance Are Coming: Shipped from Kunming to Shanghai for Distribution by the Bank of China; Shortage of Subsidiary Coins on the Market Expected to Be Resolved <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] The copper coins and copper coins in the Shanghai market are being collected by unscrupulous merchants for profit, resulting in an extreme shortage. Zero-sum transactions in various industries are deeply affected. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry requesting prompt action to remedy the situation. A "New Voice" reporter inquired with banking circles yesterday and learned that the Ministry of Finance has been studying and considering the supply of new copper coins and nickel subsidiary coins to Shanghai by the Coinage Department. It is reported that it has agreed to hand over the coins produced by the inland mint to the Central Bank for shipment to Shanghai for supply. A large batch of new subsidiary coins, including one-cent copper coins and five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent nickel coins, has been shipped from Kunming to Shanghai. It will soon arrive in Shanghai and be distributed by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank for circulation in the Shanghai market. After this, measures will be taken to ship continuously to Shanghai. Therefore, the fear of a shortage of subsidiary coins in Shanghai in the future can be considered resolved.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Not Yet Received a Reply by Telegraph</p>
<p>The shortage of copper coins and the difficult transaction situation in the Shanghai market has not diminished, and the voices of complaint and inconvenience can still be heard everywhere. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry, requesting prompt planning of remedial measures. It has not yet received a reply by telegraph. All parties hope that the authorities will quickly determine remedial measures to alleviate the difficulties. At present, stamps and printed paper are mostly used in the market for zero sums. Some shops also issue their own substitute vouchers to cope with the situation, especially the sauce and pickle industry, the smoke exchange industry, and small businesses that are the most painful.</p>
<p>Two Branch Associations Stop Issuing Substitute Vouchers</p>
<p>The 37th District Branch Association of the Municipal Federation on North Fujian Road previously approved the requests of various member businesses to issue joint substitute vouchers, jointly responsible for exchange by various businesses, in order to cope with change shortages and solve urgent needs. It was resolved to issue 10,000 one-cent and two-cent substitute vouchers each, totaling 300 yuan. All printing costs are borne by the association, to serve the member businesses. Several measures have been formulated and published in the newspapers. It is now learned that after the issuance of this substitute voucher by the association, if it is imitated and counterfeited by unscrupulous people, it will cause abuse. Therefore, at 6 p.m. yesterday (the 15th), all member businesses were invited again for detailed explanation. It was decided to cancel the resolution to issue substitute vouchers. After various businesses on Xinzha Road resolved to issue one-cent temporary substitute vouchers, representatives of various businesses gathered again at 2 p.m. yesterday, considering the difficulties caused by the lack of subsidiary coins in the Shanghai market, the government will not sit idly by, and there may be remedial measures arriving in Shanghai in a short period of time. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the implementation of the issuance of joint substitute vouchers.</p>
<p>Transportation Agencies Will Issue Paper Vouchers</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Public Concession and the concession streetcar company have indeed decided to print one-cent, two-cent, and three-cent paper vouchers. Although it is unknown on what date they will be issued, streetcar company staff said that due to the urgent situation, paper vouchers will be issued in the near future. Senior figures in the British Concession's public bus company are also considering implementing emergency measures to cope with the crisis. However, it is still undecided which measures to take. It is said that the small coins previously issued by the public bus company have been used up, and alternative measures must be planned immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Dream Recollection and Reality <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jin</p>
<p>People's attitudes to life, according to the summation of the Japanese writer Arishima Takeo, a member of the Shirakaba school who committed suicide a few years ago for "Platonic love," can be roughly divided into three categories: first, constantly focus on the future with dreaming eyes, one "future" after another. In mid-air, they erect magnificent and splendid pavilions, writing about how brilliant the future will be. The second is to spend the rest of their time solely on reminiscing about the "past." These "ghosts of the past" use pity, sighs, tears, and illusory light to decorate a pile of ruins, a gray old castle, into a brocade-covered landscape. They lie in it, looking up and down, completely content. They find the vivid "reality" boring, and they are also indifferent to the misty future. Like the two words the demon poet Baudelaire enjoys, their entire life is just "indulging" in the past. The third is to neither cling to the "past" nor have unnecessary thoughts about the "future," but to seize the present, affirm the present, and fight naked in the world of reality. Of these three attitudes towards life, only the last one is the most glorious, the most moving, and the most worthy of writing about frankly.</p>
<p>"Life is vast and difficult to predict." Our future is like a vast ocean, boundless and limitless. We don't need to guess and speculate. Even the old Mentor, the great prophet in Homer's epic, The Odyssey, is still alive and well. He wouldn't dare to predict whether your "dream" will come true or not. But as "people," we often "knowingly do wrong" and still dream all day long. This is the first-class fool. If you say that the world is depressing and infuriating, that the world is a boundless sea of suffering to you, and you hate it, and you borrow a "dream" to escape, then why not take a suicide pill like Schopenhauer and be done with it directly? The fact is that as "people," we lack both perseverance and cherish our superfluous life, so we inevitably become "fools." No matter how eloquent the argument, it is still a bunch of excuses, a bunch of nonsense!</p>
<p>Regarding reminiscing about the "past," or what is commonly called "memory," Maeterlinck once praised it as our "greenhouse of life." We certainly cannot deny the warm feeling that "memory" gives us. However, if a person's lovely life is only spent quietly growing old and quietly dying in the years of memory, then why bother Zeng Can to come to this world for a walk? Chekhov or an authoritative writer of the Tsarist era once shouted at us: "All memories are poisonous!" Maeterlinck, while praising the past as our greenhouse of life, also warned that it is also a dead city. If we are lazily satisfied with the beautiful, desolate ruins, just like a mountain pilgrim who is too devout and superstitious, then the more glorious and joyous our past is, the more we should doubt it. In an essay titled "The Past," the Belgian writer roared: "You visit our graves too often. You think you are restoring our life, courage, and love; in fact, you are robbing us of our life, courage, and love." The fact is: if a person's life is only left with "reminiscing," "yearning for the past," and "mourning the passing," then this person can only be regarded as a negligible person in the world, or at most a fleeting shadow.</p>
<p>Dreams and memories are all stumbling blocks for us. We should kick them away with one foot. Only passionately loving reality is our only path.</p>
<p>The great Gorki said: "We are not called into this world entirely for festivals and banquets, we are here to fight, so we must not forget for a moment that we have entered the battlefield, and there, we cannot just choose areas with fewer dangers; we should be like a good warrior, throwing everything we have into the place where the battle is fiercest. These words move us very much, and give us good inspiration and education. If a person can face reality, struggle in reality, and be resolute and courageous, like our soldiers who are preparing their divisions and regiments to defend the country and are making heroic sacrifices, even if they "sacrifice," one year, ten years, or a hundred years, as the great Romain Rolland said in his eulogy to Gorky, "the most beautiful and sacred tomb is in our hearts."</p>
<h3 id="e39">On the Longhai Railway Line—From Shangqiu to Lan— <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>The countryside is already filled with the atmosphere of night, and stars twinkle in the sky, illuminating the faint light.</p>
<p>A group of four of us, accompanied by a briefcase containing important items - borne by one of our brothers. With the help of starlight, we moved along winding paths; on both sides, stalks of wheat grew densely, swaying in the starlight. We passed quickly across the wheat fields with crisscrossing wheat shadows.</p>
<p>The brother carrying the heavy package walked faster and faster, and our pace quickened accordingly. All our strength was concentrated in our legs, and no one opened their mouths. In the quiet space, only the monotonous creaking of the carrying pole accompanied the fast-paced footsteps. Our destination, Shangqiu Station, was reached under this acceleration!</p>
<p>Running into the station, Ah Fa suddenly became active. He was the first to discover the train parked obediently in front of the station, with its head facing west. He jumped up with joy and shouted loudly: "Our luck is really good!" He broke the silence!</p>
<p>"Hold on, don't be so happy, I don't think it's that easy," Lao Yu didn't have much optimism about this train.</p>
<p>We put our luggage and the briefcase aside, guarded by a brother, and then ran close to the train.</p>
<p>There were no lights in the carriages. In the darkness, a large number of dark heads were moving. They were the cells of the nation, and now they were awakening and beginning to grope forward as a crowd. When asked when they arrived here, they replied that it had been two nights!</p>
<p>We ran into the stationmaster's office. The stationmaster was busy working on the telephone, and the pen in his hand was quickly sliding on the paper. He smiled and nodded at us, meaning to call us over.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, stationmaster, when will the train in front be able to leave?" I asked as soon as he took the microphone away from his mouth.</p>
<p>"There's no set time for this train, because there are too many trains heading east, and they are more needed, so we can't predict the west-bound traffic..."</p>
<p>"Then will there be any wounded soldier trains coming down tonight?" I interrupted him and then asked.</p>
<p>"Wounded soldier trains?" He flipped through the notebook he had just scribbled on. "Yes, probably around twelve o'clock." His words were very certain.</p>
<p>"Then let's wait for this train!" I looked back at the other comrades. From experience, we knew that wounded soldier trains were faster and spent less time at each stop. They had no objections.</p>
<p>Waiting for the train was the most boring and impatient thing. To make time pass faster, we talked to the stationmaster casually. He was a very good speaker, like a glib, pot-bellied merchant.</p>
<p>But this method didn't seem to be very effective. I desperately smoked cigarettes, one after another. The cigarette butts and matchsticks piled up a lot, but the clock on the wall was still leisurely refusing to move forward.</p>
<p>Finally, another two hours had passed, and the phone brought some welcome news, saying that the wounded soldier train had already left the previous station, but it would arrive here a little late. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e40">On the Road to Shangcheng—Memories of the Battlefield— <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Forced march! We had to complete the journey originally scheduled for three days in one and a half days.</p>
<p>Walking the shortcuts of the mountains and fields, people and horses crawled windingly, looking like a braided yellow rope from a distance, turning corners, sometimes separated by mountain peaks, and sometimes connected into a single line. Czech-style rifles, Russian light machine guns, and shovels reflected dazzling light in the full sunlight. Some strong, dark purple thighs made a loud sound when they walked, and the packhorse team walked together with those carrying ammunition, like going to the market. No one spoke. Everyone just climbed the mountain quietly, rushed on, and went forward, crossing the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>From the opposite side, a continuous stream of wounded soldiers came down the road, with bandages tied on their arms and injuries on their legs, gritting their teeth, wincing their mouths, and leaning on their sticks, moving forward with pain in every step. From the symbols on them, it could be seen that they were the 113th and 114th Divisions. Their faces were very dirty, and their blood-stained military uniforms emitted a pungent and nauseating odor. Someone asked:</p>
<p>"Comrades, where are you coming from?"</p>
<p>"Shangcheng."</p>
<p>"Has the war reached Shangcheng?"</p>
<p>"No, Yejiaji in the east."</p>
<p>"How many days have you been walking?"</p>
<p>"Four or five days."</p>
<p>"Is the battle fierce?"</p>
<p>"Enough to see."</p>
<p>"Which army are you from?"</p>
<p>"The 51st Army."</p>
<p>"Ah, the Northeast Army."</p>
<p>"Yes, from the Huai River to Shangcheng."</p>
<p>Why don't these wounded soldiers get car rides? Their destination is Macheng, and they still have to wait three or four days before they can be hospitalized. After being injured, their bodies have lost their original health, and coupled with the fatigue of walking, there is nowhere to change the medicine on the wound. It is truly difficult to be able to support themselves safely to Macheng. But these wounded brothers had no complaints and no resentment. They just silently and slowly rushed on their arduous journey.</p>
<p>Rescuing the wounded soldiers is a serious problem. When the government does not have time to take care of it, it is precisely when mass organizations need to shoulder this task.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sound of heavy artillery could be heard, shaking the mountains and valleys. The team was gradually approaching the front line, and gradually "entering the situation."</p>
<p>We could also see countless refugees, men, women, old and young, fleeing south in a panic. Along the way, nine out of ten houses were empty. All the light and convenient things that could be taken were carried away, leaving some bulky furniture, coldly abandoned in the house.</p>
<p>"How is the war going in front?"</p>
<p>"Ah, it's scary."</p>
<p>"Where are you fleeing from?"</p>
<p>"Fangjiaji, Yejiaji, where are you going?"</p>
<p>"To the front line."</p>
<p>What is manifested in the refugees is only panic, escape, and fear of war. They only know how to ensure the safety of themselves or their families, but they have no sense of national resistance and saving the country.</p>
<p>"Why do you want to escape?"</p>
<p>"Why not escape, ×××××."</p>
<p>"What do you do by staying! ×××× should fight them! Running every day, where is the end!"</p>
<p>"We are not soldiers either..."</p>
<p>"The nation ×× wants military and civilian unity!"</p>
<p>"You can't go to the front line without a gun."</p>
<p>"Then you can also rescue wounded soldiers and transport some supplies in the rear, everyone is running away, ×××××!"</p>
<p>Hmph... hee hee..."</p>
<p>Ignoring these words, the words were like the wind in their ears, and they forgot them after hearing them. They fled in such a panic.</p>
<p>Why do the common people want to escape? Who should bear the responsibility for this? Blaming the common people for not being willing to serve the country?...</p>
<p>The division commander shook his head and said with uncontrollable emotion:</p>
<p>"This is not a good sign."</p>
<p>"The common people of China are too pitiful."</p>
<p>"The work of mobilizing the masses has not been done at all, so this phenomenon occurs."</p>
<p>"Yes, by organizing the masses, military-civilian cooperation will lead to a future for the war of resistance. In combat, we will definitely be able to reduce many difficulties."</p>
<p>"We are going to the front this time! We must organize the masses."</p>
<p>At noon on the second day, the team finally completed the journey at the forced march speed within the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Shangcheng is an important town in southeastern Henan, and a key road in the middle of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui. The enemy is concentrating its main force, preparing to occupy Shangcheng. Then they will divide their troops to advance westward to Xinyang and southward to attack Macheng, completing the encirclement of the outer perimeter of Wuhan.</p>
<p>However, Shangcheng was safe, and the enemy was blocked at Yejiaji, and our team arrived at Shangcheng at this time.</p>
<p>Shangcheng is a small mountain city. On the city walls, large and small slogans of resistance to the enemy were written. There were wounded soldiers on the roadside, lying and lying down, some sleeping and some staring at the sky. Near them, there was always vague blood, a fishy odor, and swarms of flies, tightly surrounding those pools of blood and wounds.</p>
<p>In the city, every household closed its doors, and during the day, everyone ran outside the city to avoid the planes. Before this, the plane had dropped three bombs in the city, scaring people very much.</p>
<p>This place is like a dead city, even the county magistrate has gone to the countryside to hide and do his official duties.</p>
<p>At this time, the roar of heavy artillery can be heard more clearly, shaking the entire city, and we have entered the battlefield.</p>
<p>In the streets, you can't buy oil or salt, and no one even sells cigarettes. People who do business also flee outside the city during the day, and only at night do they light up the lights and do some business for a while.</p>
<p>The temporary internal order is:</p>
<p>"The division headquarters will be relocated to Balitan."</p>
<p>Balitan is fifteen miles away from Shangcheng, on the north side of the city. We have to climb a few small mountains. People are tired, their legs are sore, but they still leave their footsteps and move forward without complaint, preparing to confront the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Night Question <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>

<p>The blue sky, a dreamless night,</p>
<p>There are rain threads and wind flakes in the lamp,</p>
<p>Picking up a group of stars and moon,</p>
<p>Shining on a goddess' face,</p>
<p>Assuming she's by the lake at midnight,</p>
<p>Where is the human tomorrow,</p>
<p>Walking and thinking,</p>
<p>Hanging the question mark in the clouds.</p>

<p>— Suo Yi</p>
<p>—Still a Story of a Girl</p>
<p>At this time, looking out from the small round window, there were no longer the broken walls, nor the distant and near misty trees, but just a stretch of blue water, and a line made up of the distant sky, rising and falling suddenly. She thought to herself that she had probably left the estuary, so she stretched her head close to the window and looked as hard as she could, but there was no shore, the endless sea stretched out; the rolling waves left white foam, and the water stirred by the ship pleasantly rang from the mountain. She knew for sure that she had left that land of demons before she put her heart down and jumped to the bunk below, roughly shaking Jingwen, who was sleeping soundly:</p>
<p>"Hurry up, don't sleep, don't sleep, we're already at sea!"</p>
<p>Jingwen sat up blankly, unexpectedly hitting her head on the wooden plank of the bunk above, but she was not annoyed, just rubbed her scalp with her hands and walked to the window with her to look out.</p>
<p>They couldn't help but sigh in unison.</p>
<p>In the narrow cabin, they sat down facing each other, looking at each other's ill-fitting gaudy clothes and faces smeared with red and white. The two couldn't help but laugh. They had expected a strict inspection, but they had never expected to pass without anything happening. Jingwen said triumphantly:</p>
<p>"Look, I'm still good, I don't care about anything, I just slept all the way."</p>
<p>"Hmph, if there really were ×××× to come and ask questions, and catch you and ask you, I'm afraid you wouldn't remember anything."</p>

<p>Fujian Overseas Chinese Oath</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Fujian Chamber of Commerce and the Fujian Overseas Chinese Association in Hong Kong jointly held a National Covenant Oath Ceremony for all Fujian Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong at the Confucius Hall on Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. More than a thousand Fujian Overseas Chinese attended. Chairman Hu Wenhu was originally scheduled to attend, but did not attend due to business. Professor Xu Dishan presided over the meeting, and Du Siduan and Deng Yushu served as vice chairmen. Oath administrator Xu Shiying also did not attend due to business, and only Wu Tiecheng attended. When the meeting began, the ceremony was held as usual.

Then Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, which was very insightful. Then, the children's song troupe sang patriotic songs and the meeting adjourned. In addition to taking the oath, the Fujian Overseas Chinese present also signed a pledge, which reads: We are all conscientious and swear to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely support the National Government, obey the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and do our best to serve the country. If we violate the oath, we are willing to be punished by the government. We swear.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Save the Children: Scheming Individuals Exploiting Infants and Young Children to Beg; Hoping for Attention and Intervention from All Sides <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong is a thriving commercial center with a dense population. Livelihoods are pursued in countless ways. One often sees beggars in the streets and alleys, regardless of the weather. These beggars may be infants, young children, blind individuals, the elderly and infirm, or those with physical disabilities. Passersby, moved by their pitiful and impoverished state, are inclined to give them alms. Rationally speaking, the daily earnings of these beggars can be quite considerable. However, as your correspondent understands it, even begging has become a professional means of livelihood in civilized cities like Hong Kong. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three categories: (1) individuals who rely on begging to sustain themselves; (2) those who, due to physical disabilities that easily elicit sympathy from society, are employed by scheming individuals, either on a monthly basis or by giving a percentage of their begging proceeds; (3) the renting of infants. For a price of a few dollars, infants are obtained from impoverished women and taken along while begging. Those who see them, especially women, invariably offer money. For the first type, beggars are mostly elderly or infirm men and women. Besides begging, they have no other means of sustaining themselves. The government and charitable organizations should devise ways to accommodate and resettle these beggars. The second type is purely professional beggars. Scheming individuals employ those with noticeable physical disabilities to beg in various places, generating substantial income. The profits reaped by these scheming individuals are truly immense. This situation is cruel and inhumane, and the government should take immediate steps to prohibit it. The third type, using infants to beg, is an utterly inhumane practice. It has been observed that beggars place infants by the roadside and remain there all day. Occasionally, they feed them milk or other food. However, these infants are constantly exposed to the elements. Even if they do not immediately become ill and die, their vitality is severely compromised. Those dedicated to child welfare should immediately find ways to assist these impoverished and unfortunate infants. Relevant authorities should not allow this inhumane begging business to continue to proliferate.</p>

<p>The offending Shantou forces had previously announced a blockade of Shantou, prohibiting foreign ships from navigating the port. However, the British authorities adopted a firm stance and disregarded the blockade. As a result, the blockade was finally lifted the day before yesterday. According to a spokesperson for the Hong Kong Naval Authority, the Japanese forces in Shantou have agreed to recognize the British merchant ships' freedom to navigate to Shantou. From noon on the 24th, British ships can freely enter and exit Shantou port. Mail, grain, and passengers can disembark in Shantou, but cargo loading and unloading are temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Registered Secondary Schools in Hong Kong: Zonal Joint Examinations Begin Today; 37 Participating Schools Divided into Three Zones, Including Schools Relocated from Guangzhou <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong secondary schools, in order to facilitate students' further education in secondary schools and universities in mainland China, have registered with the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Department of Education in recent years. According to the regulations of the Provincial Department of Education, at the end of each semester, students of registered schools must go to the provincial capital to participate in the Department of Education's graduation joint examination. Only those who pass the examination will be issued a graduation diploma. Secondary school students in all provinces of China participate in the joint examination, and Hong Kong's registered secondary schools, mostly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, are naturally no exception. During this extraordinary period in our country, we are thoroughly implementing the guiding principles of education. The decision has been made to continue holding the joint examination as before. It has been found that 37 schools in Hong Kong have received the Department of Education's instructions regarding the joint examination, with a total of over 27,000 students (including schools relocated to Hong Kong from Guangzhou). Zhang Zimo, a supervisor from the Provincial Department of Education, is responsible for conducting the examination locally, dividing the schools into three zones to hold the examination separately. The first zone, comprising 13 schools in Central and Sai Ying Pun, is scheduled for the 26th, 27th, and 28th. The second zone, comprising 12 schools in Causeway Bay and Mong Kok, is scheduled for the 29th, 30th, and July 1st. The third zone, comprising 13 schools in Kowloon and the New Territories, is scheduled for July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. The designated examination subjects are: Senior High School - Civics, Chinese, Mathematics, English, Biology, Physics and Chemistry, History, Geography, Ethics; Junior High School - Civics, Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physiology and Hygiene, Zoology and Botany, Physics and Chemistry, History. Students who fail in three subjects will be held back a grade. After being stamped by the invigilators, the examination papers from each school will be submitted to the supervisor for review. Within ten days of the joint examination, each school must send the results to the Department of Education for verification before diplomas can be issued. The invigilators for each school are appointed by the Department of Education from among the professors of Lingnan University, Guangxi University, and National University. Apart from Pui Ying, Holy Trinity, Ginling, and True Light, which were relocated from Guangzhou, the remaining nine schools in the first zone are all private secondary schools founded by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. The invigilators appointed by the Department of Education for the overseas Chinese schools are listed below: Chung Nam (Lin Yuxiu), Southwest (Lu Zhong), Hong Kong Overseas Chinese (Zhang Hengyu), Chung Wah (Wu Luxian), Mui Fong (Xie Zhaojie), Yeung Chung (Liang Shiwen), Kwong Wah (Ouyang Yuxiang, replaced by Lu Baolian), Ling To (Zhu Huayu), Shun Sau (Li Shuming).</p>

<h3 id="e48">Shortage of Imported Vegetables and Meat: Peninsular Products Sold in Large Quantities in Hong Kong; Hong Kong and Kowloon Vendors Send Representatives Daily to Purchase; Number of Trucks Transporting Vegetables Increases by More Than Ten <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Following the Shantou incident, the supply of vegetables, livestock, and other foodstuffs to Hong Kong was cut off, causing the prices of foodstuffs in Hong Kong to rise rapidly. Although goods continue to arrive from Macau and Guangzhou Bay, preventing panic, the shortage of sources makes it difficult to stabilize market prices in the short term, which has an impact on the lives of residents. It has been observed that in the past two or three days, farmers in the Peninsula and the New Territories, feeling the shortage of imported vegetables, livestock, and foodstuffs in Hong Kong, have transported large quantities of vegetables and livestock such as pigs, chickens, and ducks to Hong Kong for sale in order to fully meet the needs of residents. The number of vehicles transporting these goods has increased. Since the 22nd, the number of trucks transporting vegetables from Kowloon City and the rural areas of the New Territories to Hong Kong has increased by twelve. In the past, there were five trucks regularly traveling to and from the New Territories and three trucks traveling to and from Kowloon City, specifically to transport vegetables and livestock for farmers. Now, due to the need to supply the Hong Kong and Kowloon markets in large quantities, it is necessary to hire more trucks for transportation. According to sources in the vegetable trade, about 500 loads of vegetables are now transported from the New Territories every day, and a similar amount is transported from villages and gardens in Kowloon, accounting for more than half of the total daily vegetable sales in Hong Kong. The expansion of agriculture in the New Territories and Kowloon is of no small help to the food supply of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents. It has also been observed that in recent days, chicken and duck vendors in Hong Kong have sent representatives to villages in Kowloon every day to purchase chickens, ducks, and livestock from farmers. The price offered for chickens is as high as 75 cents per catty, and 55 cents per catty for ducks. Although this is slightly higher than before, everyone is scrambling to collect them. The transportation and sales of pigs of all sizes to Hong Kong and Kowloon in recent days has also been of a significant quantity.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Guangdong Drama Association First Troupe, a theatrical troupe organized by outstanding theatrical workers from Guangdong residing in Hong Kong, is actively undertaking the development of theatrical activities under the leadership of drama expert Mr. Hu Chunbing.

Xia Yan, Hu Chunbing, and troupe members successively expressed their opinions, creating an atmosphere of intense academic research and presenting insightful content. The conclusions can serve as a guide for those engaged in the theatrical movement in Hong Kong. It has been learned that the troupe is scheduled to hold large-scale charity performances in Hong Kong and Kowloon in early July.

<p>The Planting and Commerce Association, believing that the Municipal Health Authority's ban on pig farming by villagers in the Peninsula has affected the livelihoods of tens of thousands of villagers, decided to appeal to the authorities to show compassion for the people's difficulties and rescind the order, in order to safeguard the livelihoods of the people and the interests of its members, in response to the request of the villagers and pig farmers. The association's leaders convened a meeting of the entire supervisory and executive committee yesterday to discuss the next steps. Attendees included Wang Bo and other supervisors and executives of the association, as well as representatives from various villages, totaling several dozen people. The following key proposals were immediately resolved: (1) Elect responsible personnel to draft a petition to the authorities and a letter to all overseas Chinese organizations in Hong Kong; (2) Elect seven representatives to be responsible for submitting the petition to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, the Chinese representatives, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Colonial Secretary, etc., outlining the advantages and disadvantages and urging the revocation of the ban; (3) Send letters separately to all overseas Chinese organizations in Hong Kong, such as the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance. At the same time, the representatives will contact and liaise with various overseas Chinese organizations; (4) Dispatch several representatives to be responsible for contacting farmers and pig farmers in various parts of the Peninsula, reporting on the progress of the appeal at any time, uniting as one, and taking joint action; (5) Appeal to the Chinese and Western press for assistance and guidance.

<h3 id="e51">Blackout Drill: Implementation Date Undetermined; Chinese Air Raid Warden to be Announced Next Month; Disinfection Team Conducts Protective Suit Test <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Air Raid Precautions Department believes that Chinese residents constitute the majority of Hong Kong's population. Therefore, it is necessary to have an air raid warden who is familiar with the habits of the Chinese to assist in carrying out air raid precautions. The department recently issued a notice soliciting applications, and many people applied. According to Mr. Sheperd, the Air Raid Precautions Commissioner, several qualified candidates have been identified for the position of Chinese Air Raid Warden. A final selection will be made from these candidates, but only after obtaining the consent of the relevant government agencies. The appointment date of the new warden is expected to be announced in early next month. Regarding the implementation date of the blackout, the plan has not yet been drafted by the Air Raid Precautions Department. Furthermore, the plan must be approved by the Army and Navy departments and their affiliated agencies before the implementation date can be announced. Commissioner Sheperd also stated that the Queen Mary Hospital recently conducted a test of the disinfection team's protective suits, and the results were quite satisfactory. However, detailed information is not available because the report has not yet been drafted. The protective suits have been tested by experts in London and found to have very satisfactory protective performance. However, Hong Kong's weather is different from London's, and working in the hot weather while wearing the suits may have an impact on the human body. Therefore, doctors from Queen Mary Hospital have been specifically requested to conduct tests. If the results are deemed unsatisfactory, improvements will be made.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Quick Notes on the Fujian Overseas Chinese Swearing-in Ceremony <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Luoxia</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>On the last Sunday of the sixth month, the Fujian overseas Chinese community in Hong Kong held a swearing-in ceremony for the National Covenant at the Confucius Temple on Jia Loushan. More than a thousand Fujian overseas Chinese, including men, women, old, and young, participated. On this hot summer day, everyone dedicated their leisure time to this solemn and sacred swearing-in ceremony. This united and enthusiastic action is truly commendable. The reporter has attended more than ten such swearing-in ceremonies, and each time the feelings are different, but this time the impression is the deepest. There, the "cohesive power" of the Fujian people was fully revealed.</p>
<p>From 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm, the main road leading to the Confucius Temple – Jia Loushan Road – was constantly filled with Fujian overseas Chinese who had come to participate in this swearing-in ceremony, their clothes soaked with sweat. The scorching sun made people's hearts even hotter! Participating in the swearing-in ceremony for the National Covenant! This is such a glorious and exciting thing. The last guest to arrive was Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the officiator, who stepped onto the stone steps leisurely wearing an apricot-grey wool coat, looking even more energetic than before.</p>
<p>The items on the agenda for the meeting proceeded one by one. Chairman Xu Dishan stood up and briefly explained the purpose of today's meeting. This solemn and serious swearing-in ceremony then began. Raising their right hands and reciting the oath, "Not to violate the Three Principles of the People! Not to…!" This heavy and heroic sound was uniform and solemn. There was no individual existence, but a whole as solid as iron. There were not hundreds or thousands of mouths, but one mouth; one huge, monstrous mouth shouting the most powerful roar of resistance against the invading enemy!</p>
<p>After the swearing-in ceremony, everyone sighed in relief from the tense atmosphere. Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the officiator, stood up to speak. First, he pointed out: "This National Covenant was proposed and passed at the National Political Council this spring. Its purpose is not only to strengthen our awareness of resistance and increase our faith in resistance, but also to have our Chinese nation swear the National Covenant under the banner of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, so that everyone will not waver in their belief in resistance, no matter how difficult the environment may be!"</p>
<p>After a pause, he continued, "The war of resistance has been going on for two years. With our military equipment, we have been able to resist the powerful enemy for as long as two years, and we are getting stronger as we fight. What is the reason for this? This is the manifestation of the strong will of the entire nation. The enemy, with the most superior weapons and mobilizing the entire nation's troops, has not been able to defeat us. This is victory!" As he said this, he shouted firmly and forcefully. A burst of applause, like continuous cannons, broke the tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>He continued, "Our final victory is not something that can be achieved by a few people, or in a few days, or even by winning three or two battles. What is needed?" As he said this, he turned around and, like a professor, pointed to the slogans in the corners of the walls and read, "Give money when you have money, give strength when you have strength, country above all else, nation above all else, military affairs first, victory first, resistance will surely succeed, nation-building will surely be achieved. Only when all the people of the country can unanimously fulfill the above obligations can we achieve victory!" At this moment, he was so eager that he seemed to want to snatch victory. Another burst of enthusiastic applause followed.</p>
<p>"Our enemy's strength is too great, so we need great strength and great sacrifice in order to defeat the enemy's strength. To deal with our powerful enemy, we must actively utilize our advantages of vast territory and abundant resources, and avoid our weaknesses. When we have sufficient awareness, we must also have a firm and unwavering belief. Then, final victory will surely be ours!"</p>
<p>"After a burst of torrential applause," he continued, "After the promulgation of the National Covenant, swearing-in ceremonies have been held in remote areas, and every citizen has enthusiastically participated in the swearing-in ceremony. I believe that after the entire nation has gone through this National Covenant swearing-in ceremony, the enemy's power in China will surely be broken very soon!" 'Pa pa pa!' A burst of applause. "Restore our independence!" Another burst of applause. "Restore our freedom!" A more enthusiastic and massive burst of applause.</p>
<p>He then said, "Our ancestors made great contributions to the civilization of this world. We Chinese have everything that the world has. I believe that our glorious history of the past will surely not be conquered by the enemy!" Another burst of enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Fujian is one of the largest coastal provinces in China and one of the first provinces to accept Western European civilization. The spirit of the people of Fujian in resisting foreign races at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China is very glorious in the history of China. The most glorious in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation – the March 29th Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs Uprising was initiated by your fellow Fujianese! As he said this, his hand also raised. The applause was so intense that it was deafening.</p>
<p>He continued that the contribution of the Fujian people in the revolutionary era of China is not only the glory of the Fujian people! But the glory of all Chinese people.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he continued: "From Hong Kong to the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, the people of Fujian occupy a large proportion. Half of the businesses in the British, Dutch, and French colonies are in the hands of the Fujian people. Today, the prosperity of Southeast Asia is due in half to the contributions of the Fujian people. The people of Fujian province have the creativity to resist foreign races and open up borders. I believe that in the future, when the Chinese nation achieves the final victory in the war of resistance, the people of Fujian province will surely play a significant role. Therefore, I hope that the people of other provinces and residents will be as enthusiastic and united as the people of Fujian, and work together to achieve our final victory." Applause accompanied him as he sat down.</p>
<p>The next item on the agenda was a song by the Glory Children's Troupe. A child ran out to announce that they were the happiest today since escaping to Hong Kong. He then reported that they would be singing five songs. The songs powerfully struck people's hearts, especially the line "Final victory is ours!" which was most moving.

<p>At 2:45 pm yesterday, a child of about ten years old was found floating in the water on the main beach of the South China Swimming Pool in Sister's Island. A Shanghainese discovered him and shouted for help, and pulled him ashore. The first aid team in the pool immediately performed artificial respiration. At the same time, Dr. Li Haotian and the Tiger Balm ambulance were called to the scene for treatment. Dr. Li examined the child and determined that he was not drowning, but rather suffering from heatstroke due to the scorching sun. He treated him for heatstroke. Later, the Tiger Balm ambulance arrived and took him to the Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. The police station was also notified. It was found that the child was named Zhao Danny (ten years old). He came to the pool with his aunt, three brothers, and one sister yesterday. When Zhao fainted in the water due to heatstroke, his brothers were unaware. It was only when he was rescued that they learned of it. After being treated by a doctor in the hospital, Zhao soon recovered and left the hospital with his father and brothers.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Hung Hom To Kwa Wan: Bizarre Robbery and Murder Case; Reported that a Man was Murdered and Thrown into a Well; Fire Brigade's Rescue Efforts Unsuccessful, Under Strict Investigation <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a bizarre murder case was suddenly reported in Hung Hom To Kwa Wan, Kowloon. The victim's body was found in a well. Police detectives investigated the area, but to no avail. The truth remains unknown. Yesterday, a man went to the Hung Hom Police Station to report that he had seen several people entangling with a man near To Kwa Wan. It appeared to be a robbery. The assailants stabbed the man to death, tied a large stone to his body with rope, and threw the body into a well before dispersing. He reported that he witnessed the entire incident and then reported it to the police station. After receiving the report, the police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to investigate. However, due to the depth of the well water, it was not possible to determine whether there was a body in the well. The police immediately notified the Kowloon Fire Brigade to send a water pump to drain the well. After receiving the report, the fire brigade dispatched a team by car to carry out the water extraction work. However, because the well was more than fifty feet deep, it took a long time and they were still unable to drain the well. They then tried other methods to retrieve the body, but to no avail. The firefighters worked for a long time but were unable to find anything, so they returned to the station. Currently, the police have not been able to confirm whether there is a body in the well, so they have temporarily filed the case and are planning to search the well again to uncover the truth.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Central Relief Committee Will Allocate Funds to Aid Shantou Refugees. The Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Relief Committee Yesterday Sent Telegrams to Various Parties Calling for Assistance. Relief Work Will Focus on the Rear Areas of Shantou. <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>On the second day after the outbreak of the war in Shantou, the Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, saddened by the disaster in their hometown, immediately initiated relief efforts. The Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Relief Committee convened an emergency meeting on the evening of the 23rd of this month, gathering leaders of the Chaozhou community in Hong Kong to discuss relief methods. It was decided to send telegrams to Chaozhou overseas Chinese worldwide, urging them to launch a unified movement to save their hometown. At the same time, designated personnel were assigned to draft a plan for saving the hometown. Since the meeting, the aforementioned work has been intensified.</p>
<p>Telegrams Sent to Various Parties, Appealing for Relief</p>
<p>The committee sent telegrams to government authorities and Chaozhou overseas Chinese organizations overseas, which were dispatched yesterday. The original text is as follows: "To the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, the Provincial Government, the Central Relief Committee, the Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan, the Bangkok Teochew Association, the Penang Teochew Association, the Jakarta Teochew Association, the Saigon Teochew Association, the Selangor Teochew Association, the Kuala Lumpur Teochew Association, the Sandakan Teochew Public Association, the Malacca Teochew Association, the New South Wales Teochew Association, the Phnom Penh Teochew Association, the Tokyo Teochew Association, the Phnom Penh Chaozhou Representatives Council, the Guangzhou Teochew Association, and esteemed gentlemen of our hometown:</p>
<p>"X is unrepentant and carries out large-scale aggression. Our solemn and splendid Shantou City has unfortunately fallen to X on the 21st of this month. Upon hearing this news, we are filled with grief for our hometown. We immediately convened an emergency meeting to carry out relief efforts. After discussion, officials were appointed to be responsible for planning and implementing relief measures, and telegrams were immediately sent to overseas Chaozhou organizations and authorities to seek ways to assist refugees. In addition to intensifying the handling of the case, we hereby telegraphically inform you, urging you to unite and implement relief measures to jointly save us from this disaster.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for War Refugees, Chairman Lin Zicao, Xu Youmei, Ma Zemin, and Lin Zishi, respectfully kowtow. Urgent."</p>
<p>The Central Relief Committee Will Allocate Funds for Relief</p>
<p>In addition to sending the ten telegrams, the committee will also send letters to the Hong Kong Federation of Charity Organizations, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Relief Committee, and other relief organizations, appealing for assistance. It is understood that Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, is very concerned about the relief of Shantou war refugees and will allocate funds for relief in the coming days. Chairman Xu dispatched a representative yesterday to meet with Lin Ziyan and others from the Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Relief Committee to discuss relief measures. The various relief organizations will also raise it at the next meeting. According to news from Chaozhou and Shantou businessmen in Hong Kong, a telegram has been received from Chaozhou organizations in Singapore, stating that upon hearing the alarming news from their hometown, they immediately discussed everything. The general opinion of the Chaozhou overseas Chinese is to establish a Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Save-Our-Hometown General Organization to be responsible for handling Save-Our-Hometown work.</p>
<p>Relief Work Focused on the Inland</p>
<p>As for the relief plan of the Hong Kong Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, it has been drafted by committee member Lin Zishi and will be completed in a day or two for submission to the next meeting for discussion. Once the work outline is determined, it will be intensified. According to Mr. Lin, the most urgent task at present is to raise funds. As for relief measures, the future work location will focus on the rear areas of Chaozhou and Shantou. Shantou is different from other places. Before the invasion by X people, our authorities were prepared, and most of the population and resources were evacuated. Eight or nine out of ten people in the city have moved to the rear. There are very few people who failed to escape after the war, and there are only over a hundred who have come to Hong Kong, most of whom are wealthy and do not need relief. It is believed that there are not many refugees left in the war zone. Therefore, future work will focus on the rear of Chaozhou and Shantou.</p>
<p>Service Corps to Return Home to Work</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of refugees near the Shantou war zone, according to representatives of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, no accurate reports have been received so far. It is also unknown whether the Cunxin Benevolent Society, the only charitable organization there, will continue to carry out refugee relief work. If necessary, personnel may be dispatched to return home to investigate. In addition, the Chaozhou Fellow Association in Hong Kong organized a Hometown Service Corps last winter. More than 20 participants, after a considerable period of training in Hong Kong, served in the Chaozhou-Shantou area. When X occupied Nan'ao and bombed Chaozhou and Shantou, the corps handled rescue work and achieved good results. They returned to Chaozhou a few months ago for adjustment. Now, due to the outbreak of the war in Shantou, the corps is preparing to depart for Chaozhou and Shantou again in the coming days to serve their hometown. They are currently planning and will depart as soon as preparations are completed.</p>

<h3 id="e60">X Warships蠢动off the Coast of Yangjiang and Dianbai. Tension Suddenly Increases in Southern Guangdong. We Implement a Blockade of Important Ports in the Southern Route. <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Xuwen Express News) The situation in southern Guangdong has suddenly become tense recently. X warships have gathered off the coast of Yangjiang and Dianbai, showing a tendency to蠢动when the opportunity arises. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>X Warships Gather off the Coast of Yangjiang</p>
<p>The 21st morning newspaper reported that there were eight X warships of various sizes and more than ten armed fishing boats and motorboats off the coast of Yangjiang. Off the coast of Dianbai, there was one giant cruiser, two destroyers, and seven or eight motorboats, patrolling and spying along the coast. We have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>The Enemy Spies on Zha Po; We Are Prepared</p>
<p>Yangjiang's Zha Po is an isolated island, not far from Nanpeng Island. Most of the islanders make a living by fishing. Now, X is eyeing it covetously, plotting to seize it. Chen Xiu, the county magistrate of Yangjiang, has ordered the local armed groups to prepare everything. If X invades, we will fight to the end.</p>
<p>Important Ports Are All Blockaded</p>
<p>The South China Military Affairs Authority believes that X is at the end of its rope and may make a desperate gamble, causing disturbances along the coast of the Southern Route. In addition to ordering all soldiers to be strictly vigilant, as a precaution, all important seaports along the coast have been blockaded.</p>
<p>X Aircraft Carrier Has Fled to the Southern Route</p>
<p>The X aircraft carrier arrived in the Southern Route in the first ten days of this month. It has been constantly dispatching planes to attack various places. According to intelligence, the X aircraft carrier moved east from Weizhou Island in the early hours of the 19th, presumably heading to the Chaozhou-Shantou waters.</p>
<h3 id="e61">X Troops on Hainan Island Loot Extensively <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Looting Scrap Iron for Transport Back to X Country</p>
<p>[South China Correspondence] X is lacking in resources, especially iron, the raw material for manufacturing military supplies. Therefore, in our occupied areas, they loot as much as possible. Hainan Island is no exception. In Haikou, Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, Ding'an, and other counties, X soldiers are looting everywhere. All the iron gates and iron bars of the shops have been pried open. Even the kitchen knives and firewood knives of the residents have been snatched away. After looting, they are transported to Haikou, and X warships transport them back to their country every few days.</p>
<p>Forcing the Public to Offer Silver</p>
<p>X has issued a large number of military notes in the occupied areas of Hainan Island to absorb our country's silver. However, the public believes that X military notes are worthless. Although X claims to buy them at the London market price, they are not fooled. X's tricks failed, so they resorted to coercion, issuing notices ordering residents to hand over all their silver within ten days and exchange it for military notes. After the deadline, troops will be sent to search house by house. Once found, they will be charged with resisting Japan. X's impoverishment is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Our Troops in Mafang Cross the River to Attack X, Burning the Cable Station and Killing Dozens of X Soldiers <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(West River Express News) Our troops stationed in Mafang, the Customs Police Regiment, on the evening of the 18th of this month, taking advantage of the moonlight, led by platoon leader Li Ruiting and dozens of strong men disguised as villagers, secretly crossed the east bank of the West River in wooden boats. They advanced on the X barracks that had recently arrived to defend the Cable Station. After landing, they divided into smaller groups and advanced towards the X camp. They found that the 19th morning happened to be market day, and many villagers were coming and going to the market. The X soldiers were not suspicious. Our troops, taking advantage of X's unpreparedness, cleverly surrounded the X camp and launched a fierce attack. X was caught by surprise and rushed out in a panic, attempting to resist stubbornly. However, the rear of the camp had been set on fire by our troops. Suddenly, the fire illuminated the sky. The X soldiers, not knowing the truth, were even more embarrassed. Our troops became more courageous, annihilating thirty or forty X soldiers. They only began to withdraw their troops when dawn broke.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Our Troops Counterattacking Zengcheng Advance to Within Three Miles of the City. The Number of X Troops in the City Suddenly Increases to Eight or Nine Hundred. <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[East River Express News] According to military news, our troops stationed in the Luofu Mountains suddenly mobilized on the 21st, advancing on Zengcheng to launch a counterattack. The vanguard troops have reached the Sanyuan area on the outskirts of Zengcheng, and the outposts have made contact. The military intelligence obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Crossing the Zeng River and Approaching Zengcheng</p>
<p>Our Lin Division stationed in the Su Futian Sucun area at the foot of the Luofu Mountains, in cooperation with the troops of the Third District Guerrilla Column, has unusually strong strength. After the outbreak of the Chaozhou-Shantou war, they were ordered to take the opportunity to counterattack Zengcheng in order to contain the X army. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 21st, Chen's unit of the division suddenly crossed the Zeng River in secret, advancing on Zengcheng to launch a counterattack. In the early morning of the 21st, the vanguard troops had advanced to the Lin area, about three miles from Zengcheng, and made contact with the X sentries.</p>
<p>The Number of X Troops Suddenly Increases; Intentions Unknown</p>
<p>According to the 21st afternoon update, the number of X troops in Zengcheng suddenly increased. Including the previous troops, the number increased to eight or nine hundred. Most of them were dispatched to the Yuehu Luozhuang villages in the northeast suburbs to be stationed. One unit of about 150 people remained in the X barracks at the Guangzeng Railway Station and the car factory. The intention of this increase in X troops is unclear. It is possible that they want to take the opportunity to launch a sudden attack, which cannot be ruled out. Our troops have decided to step up their activities. Even if X has ambitions, it will be difficult for them to succeed.</p>

<p>[Lianjiang Express News] The people of Lianjiang, because of the county's Lü Chunrong, acted as a tool for the enemy. They convened a representatives meeting on the 19th to decide on punishment measures: (1) To hold the Lianjiang People's Conference on Punishing Traitor Lü Chunrong on the 25th of this month; (2) To ask the government to confiscate and liquidate all the privately owned property of the traitor Lü Chunrong and use it for anti-Japanese expenses; (3) To expel Lü Chunrong from Lianjiang county to wash away the shame of Lianjiang; (4) All relatives and related persons of Lü Chunrong are required to express their support for the county people's condemnation within three days after receiving the notice from this association, otherwise they will be considered guilty of connivance; (5) All our people should rise up to assist the government and monitor the actions of Lü Chunrong's family members; (6) Lü Chunrong's descendants will be permanently deprived of their civil rights and will not be entitled to the public rights of this county; (7) To publish Lü Chunrong's dirty history to all sectors of society so that they know; (8) To ask the government to issue an arrest warrant for Lü Chunrong to be brought to justice and to expel him from the country; (9) To establish a committee to deal with the traitor's property and to reward those who capture Lü Chunrong alive with 1,000 yuan and those who kill him with evidence with 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e65">X Extensively Implements Enslavement Education in Panyu, Forcing Rural Children to Enter "Free Schools" <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Panyu Express News) After the puppet county government was moved to Shiqiao from Zao, Major Yoshida of the X army decided to engage in planning "county administration" and expanding propaganda. He specially selected more than 200 puppet traitors to organize armed propaganda teams, with five to ten people as a team, and assigned them to various villages to spread propaganda. He also designated that each time they give a lecture in a village, the nearby X army would send personnel to protect them, but in reality, to supervise them. In recent days, the villages near Shiqiao, such as Kengtou, Pangpu, Luo Jia Sha Xu, and other villages, have all discovered traces of these so-called armed propagandists. Every time they arrive in a village, they make absurd remarks and order the village head or the local puppet organization to force the villagers to listen. The X army also, under the pretext of "accommodating out-of-school civilians," organized so-called "free schools" in various villages, dividing them into day and night classes. For the day classes, they forced merchants to send their children to enroll, and for the night classes, they required each business to send one person. They also dispatched "teachers" selected by the puppet county to serve as teachers in each "free school." The X side also created a large number of slogans and paintings and posted them around the school, promoting Wang Dao and opposing war, in a bizarre attempt to anesthetize our people. It is reported that these so-called "free schools" have been established first in Shiqiao and Zao, and are preparing to force the various villages to set them up. In addition to implementing the above-mentioned so-called political means, the X army also believes that the puppet village heads have not "adhered" to their "policies" in maintaining local order. They have decided to conduct training for all village heads. The puppet county government has organized a training class, and the X army has sent personnel to supervise the training. It is said that the training class has been established in the puppet chamber of commerce in Shiqiao. The puppet county government is now forcing the district and village heads to attend the training class. The training courses are extremely tedious and boring. The village heads are using excuses not to attend the training class. The puppet county government, under the supervision of the X army, yesterday ordered the village heads to attend the training class by a certain date, otherwise they would be arrested and severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Anti-Traitor Movement Discovered in Guangzhou <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Express News) The Guangzhou X army authorities have recently sought to revitalize the market and carry out various resumption of business movements. Our guerrillas, aware of the enemy's plot, have decided to carry out large-scale actions. In addition to carrying out various patriotic propaganda activities among the citizens, they have also issued powerful warnings to various shameless traitors. It has been found that a certain calico shop in the Eighteenth Ward in the west of the city has recently been filled with a large number of X fabrics. Our Iron Blood Patriotic Society has repeatedly sent letters warning them, but the owner of the shop, Liang, ignored them. At 2:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month, several members of our plainclothes team took advantage of the deep sleep of everyone in the shop to blow open the back door of the shop with a hand grenade, broke into the shop, and set fire to the fabrics. Everyone in the shop was awakened, but they were being watched by our guerrillas and did not dare to move. It was not until the fire became fierce that our team members left the shop. Before leaving, they beat Liang severely. Afterwards, the X soldiers were unable to find any trace of the plainclothes team.</p>

<p>Our army on the three routes of Jiangmen, Foshan, Xinhui, and Xinkai is now advancing steadily and steadily using the tactics of紮穩打. According to intelligence yesterday, (1) Our guerrillas on the Xinhui route are unusually active. They have launched attacks in recent days and have made gains. X is firing artillery shells indiscriminately in Jiangmen to prevent our advance. (2) On the 21st, our Yang regiment had advanced towards the Metropolis, preparing to cut off the X army's transportation between Jiangmen and Xinhui. (3) A certain unit of our regular army has deployed defenses in Mei Gang, Shuangshui, Sanjiang, Muzhou, and other places, preparing to attack by waterway. (4) The night before last, dozens of our guerrillas attacked the northwest gate of Xinhui City at night.

<h3 id="e68">The Chinese Baseball Team Suffers Another Setback; The Chances of Winning the Championship Are Slim. The Friendship Monument Won Yesterday with a Score of Five to Two. Min Dian Nu Ke Defeated Nanhua Twelve to Five <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Public Baseball League game between Zhonghua and Youbei was attended by many spectators at 10:15 a.m. yesterday. The field was packed. Movie star Li Zhuozhuo also occupied a seat to appreciate the baseball skills.</p>
<p>Youbei started as the attacking group. Su Sha occupied first base with four balls. Ya Bashi's hit went from second base and shortstop, and was caught by Cai Bingfen, who passed it to second base Lin Ye, first out Su Sha. Lin Ye then threw the ball to Hu Guodong, who intercepted Ya Bashi in time, performing a double play. The applause was thunderous. When O Xiaogao Li came to bat, he got a free base, and Li Anna hit a home run. He and O Xiaogao Li successively ran back to the original base, scoring two points in a row.</p>
<p>When Zhonghua became the attacking group, Chen Fang scored a hit on first base, but was immediately out for stealing the base. Lin Ye and Qu Bingnan were successively out, and nothing was gained.</p>
<p>In the second inning, Ya Li got a free base, then stole second base. Li Anna hit the ball, and because Chen Lunying missed the ground ball, Ya Li moved to first base, but Ya Li took the opportunity to steal home, while Di Li Anna was stabbed by Chen Lunying. Huang Rongjun was nervous and threw four bad balls, allowing Rong Lixing to get on first base and then go to second base. When Xiao Li Anna hit a hit, Rong Li scored one point. Fortunately, when Su Sha and Ya Bashi came to the field, they were killed by Huang Rongjun's good balls, and the dangerous situation was resolved. When it was Zhonghua's turn to take power, the situation was quite bad. Huang Rong and Cai Bingfen both got hits, and Hu Zhengqu also reached third base, but because the opponent's defense was tight, there was no way to score. He scattered the team with zero points.</p>
<p>In the third inning, Youbei's O Xiaogao Li, Li Anna, and Xia Gaoli fell three times, and Zhonghua killed them. When Zhonghua counterattacked, Hu Guo got a "free base", and Chen Fang hit the ball and got on base, but the third baseman of Youbei intercepted the ball, passed it to the second baseman, and killed Hu Guodong. In a blink of an eye, Chen Fang was unusually active, stealing second base. When Lin Ye scored a hit on first base, Chen Fang ran to the original base, flying and shoveling, and won a point, breaking the zero. Unfortunately, when Lin Ye advanced to third base, he was thrown out by O Xiaogao Li. The fly ball hit by Qu Bingnan was also caught by Ya Li. The game was over.</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, Youbei's Ya Li was first nailed to death by Huang Rongjun's continuous good balls, and Di Li Anna hit a fly ball, which was caught by Qu Bingnan's wonderful hand. Rong Li failed to hit three times, and then became a situation of three up and three down. The fans who loved China could not stop laughing. When it was Zhonghua's turn to attack, Huang Rongjun was unfortunately killed, but Chen Lunying hit the ball and entered the first base. Hu Zhengqu took advantage of Ya Bashi's mistake and entered the first base, sending Chen Lunying to second base. Cai Bingfen shot the ball and got a hit, creating a full base advantage. If Zhong Cansen, who came on the field next, could hit a long ball, Zhonghua would not be difficult to turn defeat into victory. Zhong Cansen's hit was not far, and only Chen Lunying scored one point. Xuan Hu Guodong hit a high ball, which was caught by the opponent's center fielder, and the good dream was over. The fans were all sighing. In the next fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, the defense of both sides was unusually tight, which was extremely spectacular. Youbei only scored one more point in the sixth inning by Li Anna, and there was no gain. Zhonghua was guarded by the other side and could not use its skills. All three innings were empty. It was defeated by two to five. However, the scores of both sides were extremely close, which can be said to be the best performance of the baseball game in this competition.</p>

<p>China's failure is not because its technology is inferior to others, and the number of hits is six to four, which shows that its offensive power is not weak. In the fourth game, it once again evolved into an advantage of occupying all three bases. Almost all it gained was only one point, which was also bad luck. When it was the attacking group in the fifth game, it was originally the turn of good hitters to come on the field, but unfortunately, the hitters were nervous and did not hit many balls. At this point, China's endgame was determined. The fourth and fifth games were originally the best opportunities for China to seek a comeback, but they failed to make good use of them, and they eventually suffered a defeat. It is a pity.</p>
<p>However, the biggest cause of the defeat was that when it was the defensive group in the first and second games, it transferred Chen Fang to be the catcher, and Huang Rongjun did not calm down at the time, and even made as many as four ball counts, giving Youbei a chance. Therefore, it lost four points in these two games, and Chen Lunying had an error, so the sign of defeat appeared.</p>
<p>The defense of both sides was excellent, so there were very few mistakes. China only had two, and Youbei had one. The tightness of the whole game can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Although Huang Rongjun had four four-ball counts, he performed as many as ten three-ball counts, which shows that his skills are extraordinary and he is better than Xia Gaoli. It is a pity that the accuracy of the hitting was not as accurate as the opponent's, and the hitting was not far enough, which made Youbei perform as many as twenty-one kills and fifteen catches.</p>
<p>Now that China has suffered another defeat, the hope of winning the championship has been greatly affected. It is feared that the "throne" of this competition will no longer be occupied by China. (Taishui Ball Team)</p>

<p>- Ding Lao</p>
<p>Curbertin's biography: Pierre de Curbertin was born on January 1, 1863, into an old French family. He studied in Paris as a child. In 1884, at the age of twenty-one, he went to study in England. He was very interested in the life of Rucly ethnbarrow and his Pullic scboal. Recalling his motherland's educational life, he felt ashamed because various colleges and universities were not as enthusiastic about outdoor sports as the British. Outdoor sports are not just a sports issue, but also contain a significant meaning, which is that British moral training and the element of strength are the key to becoming a strong country. It's not just about muscle training and male beauty, but also about rejecting all hypocrisy and fraud in the entertainment field. Therefore, wherever the British go, they are always trustworthy and respected, which is the foundation of their personality, built on a daily life based on competition. Moreover, the team life cultivated in competition destroys individual power. Many French educated youths are physically weak and neurotic. On the other hand, they are in danger of indulging in the enjoyment of beauty and lack the steadfastness of the British. Therefore, the British do not regard competition as a children's game, but simply as a successful place for the spirit of sacrifice. This was his observation of the British. In 1888, at the age of twenty-five, he published a book on student life in England, Peducatian en Ancisisre, which attracted worldwide attention and won the praise of the French, who respected him as a successful youth author or social reformer. As a result, he was appreciated by Jules Semon, a politician, educator, and scholar with great insight. He served as a member of the Committee for the Popularization of Educational Games and Competitions. In 1889, the Paris Exposition held a sports conference. In the autumn of that year, the Ministry of Civil Education appointed him to study in the United States to study the organization of American universities and student life. After returning to China, he worked hard to promote Athletic sbarts with considerable success. From 1891 to 1892, under his guidance, the French Sports Association, Uniondes socjetes dessherts A bletieues, which is now well-known, was organized. This organization consisted of about 200 French sports clubs and half of the university sports groups. In 1892, the English football competition began successfully. The British Heniy Re alta Committee recognized the French district team and allowed France to participate in the Sawinc crews on the bams River. At the same time, the United States also allowed French competitions, which was the result of the efforts of his very good friend Professor Sloane. After these achievements, in November 1851, he delivered a speech at the Sosdonne Arena Amhhitheetsc in France, proposing the revival of the international Alymbic Games, which were to be held once every four years. All national Amutours athletes and students could participate in the Games. Therefore, in 1893, his second trip to the United States was entirely about the Games, and it yielded good results. After returning to China in the autumn of that year, he gave speeches everywhere about the Olympic Games, arousing general interest. By the summer of 1894, he had first presented the matter of the Games to the British Parliament, and from June 16 to 24, the Olympic Games Conference of National Representatives from twelve countries was held at the Sordorue in Paris. Emperor Georce of Oellens supported the conference and wanted to combine it with the bosi du bnnlocne festival. As a result of the eight-day meeting, the ancient Olympic Games were revived, the establishment of an organization and the implementation of all affairs was established, and it was decided to hold the first modern Olympic Games in Athens, the capital of Greece, in 1894. This matter was thus successfully concluded. (XI)</p>
