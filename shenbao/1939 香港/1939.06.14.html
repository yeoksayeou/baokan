<h3>靜靜的北海（北海特訊）</h3>
<p>— 王河天</p>
<p>當我們抵達合浦城時候。好似走進希無人煙的境地，一座×機浩劫後的死城！被炸的街道、殘垣敗壁，就是還有些完整的商店，也門戶緊閉局上加鎖，恐怖的空氣籠罩着每一個角落，——而且在第二天早上×機八架又來狂炸。然而當我們跑到北海來，以爲在×人跑口下的地方，危險性是更大的，誰料情形出於我們意外，不但沒有覺得恐怖，却相反的，北海的安靜是廣東城市中所少看見，法蘭西式的街道依然齊齊整整的，沒有看見一間被炸的房屋，假使不是街上行人稀少，商門半閉，我幾乎忘記了這是在×人砲口威脅下的北海，爲甚這裏與×人咫尺之近，又是這樣的安祥，是什麽原因呢？經過兩天的視察，深深覺得北洧潛伏着一種嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>一　北海目前的狀況</p>
<p>北海是東京灣最大的商埠，海道南通安南，東到香港，是南路的重鎮，也是廣西出入的海口，法英德都有領事館設此，可見商業的發達。在過去曾改爲市。現已取銷，全鎭有十三保，二萬九千二百四十九人，但因×機威脅有許多市民已遷移鄉間，雖然現存外國商船經常來往香港，而商店多己關門，有些也不敢購貨，店門半掩半開的賣貨尾，好像坐等時機似的，而且有些巨商已將貨品寄放到外國領事館，或者外人辦的醫院裏坐觀動靜。</p>
<p>政治的動員</p>
<p>北海行政方面，過去對於壯丁的訓練與徵兵有相當的成績，並且這裏靑年看當兵爲榮耀，曾有五十五名壯了請纓殺×。實施優待出征軍人家屬，砠織優待出扯軍人家屬委員會，舉行過現金慰問，每月每家給二元，創辦出征軍人子弟學校四所，免費讀書。對敎育方面，改私塾爲民衆學校，在督導區內，各校敎師組織巡迴敎育隊，在民衆稠密的地區實施義務敎育，在督導區內各校設立民象識字班，並且得抗先隊同志的帮助，各榔都在順利進行着，說到民衆動員的工作，如破壞公路，與協助軍隊建築工事，都相當踴躍，但是鄕村保甲組織太不健全，民衆動員工作還是不够。</p>
<p>二　北海的救亡工作</p>
<p>在北海過去的救亡工作，合浦縣是殺熱烈最有成績的地區，救亡團體整整有十個話劇社，但自×人威脅北海合浦第一中學搬遷走後，救亡的工作也成尾聲，不是因經費的困難，就是因環境的惡劣而逐漸停頓，現在只有第五區抗×後援會戰時服務團與婦女抗×同志會，還有多少工作外，其餘的團體已停止了，最近婦抗會發動　女賣花救國，結果得兩百多元，她們將該款　慰勞去慰勞品防軍與對防軍獻旗，鼓勵守土戰士，此外她們舉辦救護訓練班，準備參加前方救護工作。</p>
<p>手車碼頭工友抗×</p>
<p>最值得我勻安慰的就是防軍政工隊同志們在這種環境下面，他們推動幾百個碼頭手車工友組織，並參加抗×同志會，手車工人以組爲單位，組有組長，經常召集開會，在五一節實行國民抗×公約宣　。他們因爲生活關係，不懂得　會，在碼頭工友同志會成立的時候，選舉幹事，但他們不憧『幹事』是什麽意思，並且叫不慣，因此他們稱工會的幹事爲「工頭的工頭。」這真是怪有趣味的稱呼！</p>
<p>此外還有理髮工人抗×同忘會與民衆夜校員生抗×同志會，除每週出版壁報外，還沒有什麼工作表現</p>
<p>三　北海的危機</p>
<p>北海雖然是一個無險可守的平原海岸，隨時都有被×人登陸的可能，但是防軍在「保衛國士是軍人天職」的任務之下，己做起許多　强殺×的丁事，而北海當局更應該將全體民衆組織起來，武裝起來，協助防軍爲保衛家鄕而奮鬥！</p>
<p>一區三公</p>
<p>可是北海最高的機關就是第五區署，警察局，與北海鎭公所，對這種工作做得太不够了；並且他們本身摩擦很厲害，本來，後面兩個機關都屬區署指揮的，但警察局長以爲他也是民政廳委任的，做事也沒有和區署商量。鎭公所以爲是地方主人，有權有勢，任所欲爲，甚至因利益的衝突，警長打保長，因戲女人事情警兵與自衛團要械鬥，最近鎮長因走私關係　吿社訓壯丁隊李××十大罪狀，總之這種種摩擦的事情在漢奸排撥之下更行加深，這是很危險的</p>
<p>走私問題</p>
<p>有人說，廣州之失是失於淡水定私，今天的北海有同樣現象。這裏雖然有海關和少數的緝私人員，但是這裏海岸線的長，是防不勝防的，並且這裏走私是有組織性的，有地方武裝保護的定私，據調杳所得，走私的後臺老板是奸商，而一部份鎮鄉保長半公開的在電白寮，白虎頭，高沙龍，龍潭，大觀沙，南康，樂民婆圍，等處定私，北海第五區署會扣留走私的商沙龍鄉長。因爲走私的關係，海關收入大減，</p>
<p>仇貨充斥于鄕村小鎭，如火油一項，在南康一箱只賣六七元，但在北海要賣二十餘元。北海鎭第二保壯丁隊有獲走私貨木油八桶，而鎭長以大隊長的名義强迫他們交出，後來鎭長打賞第二保花紅三十元毫券，說貨己交還原主，其實這八桶木油怎　下落呢，他們不得而知（？）。晚上我特別跑到海岸去視察防軍與壯丁隊放步哨。不意地看見警察也在海濱，本來海濱沒有警察的崗位，但是他們爲什麽跑到這裏來呢？後來調查才曉得他們也有另外的生意—總之，北海走私日趨嚴重，假使不設法消弭，也許北海生命就斷喪走私的壞手裏。</p>
<p>漢奸的活躍</p>
<p>自去年東興破獲漢奸麥某，供出在北海開金鋪的老板　子厲漢奸伏法後，大家都注意到北海漢奸的活動，但因爲這裏環境複雜，（有各國領事館，有外人開的醫院）同時我們政治機構不嚴密，連警局對居民遷移登記的工作都停止了，更給漢奸活動的機會，破壞救亡工作，如婦女抗×同志會，組織妓女讀書班，漢奸馬上就破壞，說政府想抽妓女去當兵，嚇得她　不敢來念書，又如手車，碼頭工人有了組織，但被漢奸造滛威脅，弄得「抗×」兩個字都不敢提起。地方巨商準備過順民生活，將貨物寄儲　外國領事館內，同時準備北海淪亡的到臨，與外人組織難民救濟會，並且自去年合益號老板龐寬甫　仇貨——硫化石（五十桶）案發生後，政府沒有處置他，而奸商更明目張胆破壞抗戰。</p>
<p>漁民救濟問題</p>
<p>從×艦進入東京灣後，首先受其打擊的就是漁民，尤其是圍洲島第二次淪陷×手後，漁民死於×手的不下一二千人。現在他們不敢出海捕漁，而靠海爲活的漁民生活一天困難一天，並且×人常以小惠來引誘漁民，我們受過去羅店海鹽的敎訓，已注意漁民的救濟，然在合浦黨政軍聯席會議上，雖已經提出，可是沒有結論，這也是嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>總括以上幾點：北海楚潛伏嚴重的危機，現在我們要克服這種危機，保衛北海。要（一）黨政機關人昌的調整。（二）加强北海救亡工作的領導，與實施戰時民衆動員方案。（三）賺好運動的開展。（四）澈底解决漁民救濟問題。因爲北海是雨路的門戶，也是保衛南甯的外圍線，假使這幾個問題沒有得到解决。北海的危機是沒有辦法克服的。</p>
<h3>義賣運動與創造新時代成人教育</h3>
<p>— 雷沛鴻</p>
<p>自從「七七事變」爆發，整個中華民國的人民，一齊踏上不惜任何犧牲而務必切實踐履的大道。這就是民族解放的大道。雖則這一條大道是迂迴曲折，又是艱難險阻，然而在較遠或較近的處所必有指路碑，指示淸淸楚楚　使行人不會迷途，更不會失路。世界史吿訴我們，自從十八世紀以來，民族解放的潮流增高，一波未平，一波又起，只有醉生夢死的人民，理亂不　不問，痛癢漠不關心，纔至於迷却方向，而誤入枉死城的歧路，只有自暴自集的人民，妄自菲薄，甘居失敗，纔至於墮後落伍，而終於被社會淘汰。如其不然，倘若某些人民，在民族解放程度上，隨時隨地，能自己提撕警覺，又能相互　作奮鬥，他們的前程必定是遠大，又是光明，他們的功力不但不枉費，而且必有極大收穫。最後這種極大收穫的登峯造極，就是民族解放的成功。</p>
<p>具體地說，這時會是中華民族，自有歷史以來，一向未嘗遭遇的創鉅痛深的動亂。而這樣創鉅痛深的動亂的處理和解决，在未來的中國社會，無疑地，必然惹起一個基本變化。這個基本變化的詳情，在目前，我們固不具論，而且不能項先深論，但無論如何，這種變化，槪括地說，儘可以百變不離其宗。那是要說，我們的最高理想是「在求中國之自由平等」；而其最大成功卽爲民族自由，民權平等，民生幸福之實現，以建立三民主義的社會。</p>
<p>在如此重要時會之下，我們必須樹立一個創造新代的成人敎育體係，然後足以控制新發展而應付新要求，在「成人敎育體係」的術語之上，我們冠以「創造新時代」宇樣，那無非要指出一要旨，卽謂：普通學校敎育，對於新時代所課的任務，固然是不够；而一般民衆或現行成人敎育之强調識字敎育者當然更是不够。誠以敎育是個人加入社會的一種歷程，而爲着有效地參加社會生活起見，某個人對於那社會的理想和目的，非有充分了解不可，在今日我們的社會，其最大而又最重要的組織單位，自然是我們的國家——中華民國其最普遍而又最平凡的社會生活　當莫如中華民族的民族生活。至於我們的社會理應和目的，除前者在上文已提示外，而關於後者，則丁此民族解放運動之際，就不外是：「國家至上；民族至上；抗戰第一；勝利第一；意志集中；物力集中」。這些都是活的敎材，必有待於全國人民在生活上之實踐，這些在今日社會上都有根本的重要性而構成敎育上之主要題材，必有待於全民族各分子之脚踏實地而做出實際工夫，不幸之至，現行學校敎育旣一槪注重傳統的課程修習，而一般成人敎育以至民衆敎育和社會敎育，復無非一味强調識字敎育的普及，唯其如是，這幾類敎育，縱使眞能實事求是，亦不足以引發廣大羣衆，使他們充分了解社會，又使他們切實參加社會生活，因此之故，一個創造新時代的成人敎育體系必須樹立，依之，敎育與生活庶幾得以切實聯繫，而民族解放的使命庶幾得以及　完成。</p>
<p>基於以上所論述，義賣運勁的重要性及其社會價値，當可以不煩言而索解。本來「義賣的起因，說起來極平淡，極渺小」這是吳涵眞先生所吿訴我們的說話，繼此，他還叙論義賣的經過，並縱論民衆　動的成功和失敗的關　所在。他在懇切地指出：「今日能發動群衆，能動員群衆的，不是空口講白話的　些人；而是平日忘　了自己的利害，眞眞實實爲群衆服務，爲羣衆謀利益，爲群衆解决問題的　些忠誠的人」。他更在沉痛地申說：「你爲群衆，羣衆要你；你爲自己，群衆離你」。這些都　涵眞先生由民運工作而得到的書貴經驗。如果他容許　　僭越我還要插入一句話，卽說：這　我們成人敎育者參加社會運動所穫取的道德敎訓。</p>
<p>本來在這樣動亂的社會中，一切交互行為及共同行爲，最不容易組織起來，縱使組織暫時成功，亦容易消失其原有組織，倘若不立時設法補救，這些行爲且將無由發動或繼續進展。在這裏，先就義賣而談義賣，更從義賣遝動說到救國運動，我對於香港的義賣小販，誠不勝瞑拜頂禮之至。這番說話，讓我先聲明一句，並非是感情用事的說話；相反地，它是從客觀的態度以從事於事實的分析而得到的結論。具體的說，香港義賣運動最初導源於深水埗兩個果販，進而影響於十二個小販，更進而推行到深水捕區及旺角區小販義賣，在未有義賣以前，這一羣小販原來是各個獨自經營的小販，　常理觀察，他們平素不但不相聞問，甚至很容易地惹起各自競爭。在這種場合之下，交互行爲及共同行爲本來極難椎動。可是爲　救中華民國之故，爲等救同胞之故，一個一個的小販，激於義憤，發於愛國愛民的熱誠，竟能團結起來，於是，義賣遂成了交互行爲，義賣運動更成了共同行爲。在此際這一羣小販，我們可以想見，當然免不了時時碰壁。而且就俗眼觀察，他們本是無知無識，直可稱之爲「蚩蚩者氓」。可是，不管前途有甚麼險阻，他們仍堅决地擁護這　交互行爲　公共行爲的中心目的；無論遭遇甚麽困難，他們總能本善天眞爛漫的一片熱誠和勇往無前的一腔熱血，以克服這種困難。其結界是：這一羣小販就變成救國救民的志士，復做成愛國愛民的仁人。從成人敎育遝動觀察，這不但是這一羣小販的自我敎育的成功，而且是社會生活的舊有經驗的新創造。更從民族解運動放觀察，這不但是香港僑胞的極大貢献，而且是中華民國的無上光榮。</p>
<h3>日本參加防共同盟問題</h3>
<p>— 萬仲文</p>
<p>這是四十多年前的舊事：黨日本受了三國還遼的干涉而開始主張與英國締結同盟的時候，卸任未久的陸奧宗光外相，却力疾揮其銳筆，在其機關雜誌「世界之日本」上，發表了一篇題爲「外交同盟之楔子」的論文，　陳英日同盟言之過早，其辭曰：</p>
<p>『日英同盟，其名甚美，時人對此之期望亦甚大。然英國實非憂人之憂救人之急的唐吉吉德者也；日本欲由同盟以取得其安全之保障，英國亦非取得此同樣之担保不可。若不能予與此担保，則英國決不能成為同盟之與國也。誠不知論者認為日本現今之國力對於無限的英國防禦綫果能予與安全保障否也？……當遼東事件之時，伊藤內閣前瞻後顧以待英國之發言，使英國有一言以表示同盟之情義，則伊藤內閣亦必决心暗中飛躍，一試其乾坤一擲之快事；逎英國竟不出此，反望伊藤內閣聽從三國之提議，此豈非表示英國在東洋地位之好例哉？……故日本之兵力若與今日無大差，則所謂日英同盟者，夢想而已，虛榮而已，晝餅而已。』（明治二十八年八月發刊）</p>
<p>陸奧在此論文中，已輕輕指出了同盟外交的幾個要件：一是利害相等，二是力量相等，三是担保相等，此數要件，實爲判斷同盟外交能否成立的唯一根據，徵之歐洲同盟外交往史，亦莫不皆然，談到最近×國是否要參加德意日三國防共軍事同盟問題，他們也可作如此觀。</p>
<p>當然，在表面上，日本爲了要斷絕英法美蘇之援華，以如願以償地收拾其侵華戰爭的戰果，固有與德意締結軍事同盟之需要，然而在實際上探討起來，則這個同盟外交的問題，即是非常的微妙復雜，並非如一般人所想像的那　簡單。</p>
<p>第一是利害問題。日本的中心利害在於侵華，而侵華，在目前及最近之將來，對於英美法蘇的關係，並未達到正面衝突非戰爭不能解決之階段。雖然日本也嚷着南進，要奪取歐美在太平洋中的一切屬地，這也不過是少壯軍人和新興政客的誇大宣傳，事實上目前日本有沒有這個必要？有沒有這個能力？縱然奪取了又能不能永久保持？皆成問題。最後決定日本國策的金融資本家及一般元老重臣們。想必不至軯率地把少壯軍人的誇張宣傳當做行動綱領，　爾，則日本的利害便與德意的利害大不相等，因爲日本爲了自已的利害，原可不以英美法蘇為×而參加大規模的世界戰爭，但若與德意同盟，則日本為了德意在歐洲及菲洲的利害，勢必參加第二次世界大戰，狡猾的日本××，絕不幹此犧牲自己而憂人之憂急人之急的吉珂德先生的「英雄」工作。</p>
<p>第二是力量問題。日本如果參加德意軍事同盟，則在將來大戰中，勢必傾其全陸海空軍的力量，正面對付持久抗戰的中國，北面對付陸軍大國的蘇聯，南面對付海軍大國的英美，遠處歐洲的德意皆不能以相等的力分其相等的勢。只有日本在遠東獨力支持，這是日本想唱而不能的獨腳戲。</p>
<p>第三是担保問題。由於三國作戰力量上的不相等，其担保亦自不相等。日本若參加德意同盟，則日本之給予德意的担保較之德意給予日本之担保爲重，日本雖至愚，亦不願抬此　重而無氣味的「片棒」。</p>
<p>綜上三點觀之，可知日本目前似不至于參加　着遍自動的德意軍事同盟。日本今後對德意的外交，較爲可能而必要的，只有下列三項：</p>
<p>第一是與德意締結專以蘇聯爲對象的同盟外交，其內容與第一次日英同盟相類，卽：日本若單與蘇聯一國開戰，則德意守好意的中立；若其他國家因日蘇戰爭而軍事援助蘇聯，則德意須以車事援助日本。其作用卽在於局限將來必不可免的日蘇戰爭而取得勝利，此與第一次日英同盟亦相類。</p>
<p>第二是利用原有日德意防共政治協定的軸心，於適當時機，展開協調外交，以與英法美蘇談判遠東問題，取得侵華旣成戰果之保降。陸奧宗光會說：「日本可對列　妥　而不可對華放鬆一步」，這是日本巧妙的傳統外交策略！</p>
<p>第三是利用防共軸心，靜候國際局勢變化，來一套乘火打刦的外交。日本於第二次歐戰中。卽使不參加德意作戰而守中立　也大可利用此舉足輕重的地位。來向英美法蘇威脅敲詐。</p>
<p>此三項今後×國　外交政策，無一不與我國抗戰息息相關，而且値得我們嚴重警戒，我們雖在客觀上不能轉移×人勢所必趨的外交政策，我們惟有準　更苦的犧牲，下更大的决心，堅强而自信地抗戰下去，根絕一切顯　的對×求和之投降主張　屛除一切等待國際形勢結束戰爭的僥倖的機會主義，由自主的抗戰，爭取自主的外交，以與×國及其他堅苦英勇地周旋到底，實現抗戰建國的無上要求！</p>

<h3>萬山叢中的婦女班</h3>
<p>— 白翠珍</p>
<p>（省溪持訊）在這萬山叢中的省溪，產生了民衆讀書班，我敢大膽的說，還是一件破天荒的事情。這讀書班已經辦了兩個多月了。爲的不妨碍他們的做工的時間，成立了兩個讀書班。日班下午一點到三點，完全是女生。夜班七點到九點，完全是男生。男班報名的有二十六人。因爲他們都是打石岩，揀砂子，做買賣的，有時候他們在礦廠裏，或到路遠的地方去趕場，不能囘來，因此能够按時來讀書的、各班只有，人左右。敎的科目：有國語，常識，算術，時事，唱歌。現在我想專談談婦女班的情形。</p>
<p>婦女班裏有七個是每天必到的，她們的年紀最大的三十歲，最小的才十六歲。有兩位是天天帶着娃妹來讀書的。每星期要開一次座談會，內容大致是：（一）怎樣撫育孩子，（二）民挨解放運動中，婦女應該要做些什麽，（三）侵略中國的是日本的什麽人，（四）中國婦女爲什慶這樣苦，（五）蘇聯的女子怎麽會那樣舒服，（六）我們要怎樣才能够走上幸福的道路，這些問題討論的時候當然要設法，合乎她們的口味。記得開第一次座談，時會們一個不機也肯開口，我極力想引起地們說話的動他，便先說：『今天我們大家隨便談談罷，各人報吿各人家裏的事好不好？現在請白翠珍先說好　？』她們都在暗暗的你推我說，我推你說，結果是一個也不肯說。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，我只有拿她們頂切身的事來談，我先就問她們：『你們那一個的先生的脾氣最好？』她們聽了都笑起來，同時臉也發紅了，似乎是怪不好意思在這裏我又只好說話了：『我知道你們的先生一定都是待你們很好的，不像我們別面的壞風俗眞是要不得，男子把女子壓迫得死死的，常常有許多男人，自己抽煙呀，喝酒呀，打牌呀，家裏的事一點不管。做妻子的，只有忍受着一切，如果他的妻子呌他不要做那些不正當的事，對不起，就要吃他的皮拳子』。坐在我對過的楊春秀帶着憤恨態度：「哼，我家的那個還不是那樣！幸是衙門裏派他修路去了，要是在家裏的話，我一天的快活日子都沒有得過，那裏還想得到讓書啊！提起來我氣極了！他家裏頭上沒有頂的，腳下沒有踏的。我自己的吃，穿，都是靠着帮人家縫衣，洗衣，揀珠砂得來的，他還時時追著我要錢去抽烟，抹牌呢！不給就要挨打，我只希望他死在外面不要囘頭！我一個人在家裏一面讀書，一而帮人做工倒要快活多了。」旁邊的劉　珍看到春秀說得吃勁，便也自動的說起她苦頭：「你，還有我咧！不是你們親眼看見嗎？那個砍頭的常常把我打得手腫臉靑，還要叫我滾，說我是他娘買來的了頭，他不要。我不但是受那個砍頭的打駡，同時還得要受公婆和小姑的氣，這次正好是那個砍頭的，被派上去修路了，再一方面是查先生到我家　同我婆談，硬勁要我來讀書，不然的話，我除非是來生讀書，這一生是想不到讀書，我的苦處，眞是說不盡」。便哭起來，田老翠說：「不要哭了罷，像我們這般人只怪命不好，是前生沒有修得，我家裏一個是整天的忙着爲他自己抽鴉片的事，我幫人洗衣服存下的幾個錢，現在擺個攤子，做點小生意維持我和娃娃的生活，像這　丈夫，還是沒有丈夫闊氣些」，楊林芝：「哭沒有用，一個辦法，是同他鬥打，打不過，我們聯合起來相幫！再就是把他拖到衙門裏吃官司，我家一個從前還不是一點事不對，就抓住我的頭髮打一頓，有一次打得我眞痛，我氣的奈何不得，我拚命的把他拖到衙門裏去，被打了幾十板屁股，以後，他後也不敢輕易的打我了」。（大家都鼓掌）</p>
<p>最後我說：「對的！我們不要以爲女子是應該受男子欺侮的，我們要放剛强些，女子的能力並不此男子差，前方的許多女兵不是與男子同　殺××××——現在的女子，不能像從前的女子那　懦弱，一切都服從男子，現在的時代，是新時代，新時代的女子，要爭取她的一切自由，平等，我們不要說，我們的命不好，幸福是我們自己創造，不過目前被日本帝國主義迫壓下的中國，我們只有幫助抗戰，才能取得自由解放，怎樣帮助抗戰呢？當然，能够上前綫的是更好，不能到前方去的，在後方做生產工作，補助前方的消耗。替前方將士縫衣，做鞋子，幫助前方將士撫靑娃娃，和照料年老們的父母，慰勞傷兵，服侍傷兵等等的工作，不但我們自已這樣做，還去發動鄉下的老百姓都能這樣做，因爲要把日本帝國主義打走，只有老百姓團結起來才行，打走了日本帝國主義，新的國家才得實現，那時候，我們才有好日子過」。</p>
<p>他們的進步很快，起初是一個字不識，規規矩矩，不說話的一些女子，可是讀了兩個月的書，就完全不同了，現在他們能上台演講，能够參加唱歌，能够逢趕場期　宣傳工作，能够記日記，現在　他們的日記選　篇寫在下面。</p>
<p>今天是星期一上國語後，做紀念週，查先生對我們講事時，現在已　我勻大武漢攻下了，我們這地方也很危，來的話，我們就加入到游擊隊裏去，因爲我聽到查先生說游擊隊是老姓組織起來的，男的女的都有，利害得很：我還有一天聽到操先生說，東北有個趙老太太，頭髮都白了，她還在游擊隊裏當領導人呢！我希望我們這裏早一點組織游擊隊就好了。我們大家還要齊心合力，團結得牢牢的，把×××××得一個都不留在中國才好，如果國家亡了，男子沒有好日子過，女子更沒有好日子過啊！（楊春秀十一月二十三日）</p>
<p>昨天我去學校裏讀齊，查先生吿　我們的事，說××××被我中國打敗了現在我們的向胞，應當更努力的，加緊工作，打倒日本帝國主義！（楊林芝十一月二十三日）</p>
<p>我今天聽見小先生在街上宣傳，說日本鬼子侮辱我們中國女子，殺死了我們許許多多的同胞，撿去我們的國土，常德也被他轟炸了，我一聽到心裏眞氣的奈何不得！（劉　珍十一月二十五日）</p>
<p>有一天聽說查先生要走了，我讀書都用不下心去了，第二天聽說　不定了，我很快樂的！從她到這裏來了，我們已經曉得許多國家的事，現在我們的常識也是一天更進步一天了，希望我們同學大家都努力的前進，走刊那幸福的路上去罷！（白翠珍十月三日）</p>
<p>今天我們又開會了，討論在這抗戰的時候，女子要做些什麽事，後來查先生還提議我們以後每次趕場都參加男校出去做宣傳的工作，我們都贊成了，但是我嘴裏　贊成了，心裏很駭怕，因爲我不曉得宣傳的時候要講些什麽話，後來查先生說，每次趕場的前兩天，我們就要討論宣傳的材料，演講是大家輪流着並决定演講的人。在　場的前一天，我們去上課的時候，要練習講一遢，有不對的，查先生補充，我知道了這些情形以後，我也就不駭怕了，並且我心裏很喜歡，因爲我們這地方的人看不起女子，我們能到街上去演講，給他們看了，他們曉得我們女人也有用呢！</p>
<h3>抗戰中的婦女解放問題</h3>
<p>（桂林通訊）陳逸雲先生，中國國民黨中央社會部婦女運動委昌會委員，新運總會婦女指導委員會戰地服務組組長，婦女共鳴月刊總編輯，壓來是一位婦女界有聲望的領導者。</p>
<p>最近陳先生由湖南祁陽來桂，負了兩件任務，第一是進行接洽印刷事項，預備將「婦女共嗚」雜誌移桂出版。這是一件可喜的消息，作爲中國西南心臟的挂林，實在太需要一個領導婦女工作的刊物了。第二件是爲了購買大批藥品，並希望各界能盡　捐助他，因爲自從南昌失守，遭受大轟炸的衡陽，己無法講到藥品了，而苦難的鄉民是怎樣的需要醫藥品。</p>
<p>自從抗戰以來，陳先生奔走各地，熱心領導婦女作救亡工作，半年前，復受蔣夫人之委，任婦女戰地服務隊隊長，率領了百餘女同志，在湖南各縣做鄕村動員工作，工作了半年，經過十餘縣，獲得許多可貴的工作經驗，現在隊伍仍在衡山一帶工作。</p>
<p>她這次忙中　暇來桂，只有幾天逗留，不日仍返祁陽，這數日內，她和廣西婦女領袖李夫人，白夫人，黃夫人，並婦女工作幹部都曾談過，陳先生表示，深深感服於廣西政治組織以及各種實施的健全，並談及以後廣西婦女運動應向鄉村展開，使知識婦女更能發揮其領導作用，完成廣西婦女的廣大動員。</p>
<p>日前廣西省府全體女職員作集合在省府大禮堂，聽陳先生演講抗戰中的婦女解放問題，歷述中國婦女運動的過去和現在。經廿餘年來的汾鬬，中國婦女運動仍無多大進展的原因，現在，在前綫軍隊的政治部仍很少婦女政工員，又如在　間仍有婦女過着地獄生活的痛心現象，這些都是爲了婦女雖在政治經濟等的表面上獲得與男子同等的權利，實則因婦女政治認識和各種知識能力的貧弱，而放棄了許多權利，而遲緩了自身解放的爭取，所以婦女要在抗戰勝利後獲取政治經濟各種權利，必須在抗戰中加强自己的政治以及各種修養和加强抗戰工作。末了又講廣西省政府有七十餘位女職員，這種好現象在別省是不可得的，廣西婦女的艱苦奮鬬情形，素爲人稱道。但希望更能努力，尤其是站在領導地位的省政府的婦女中堅，應利用地位與能力，動員組織鄕村婦女，勞動婦女，有組織有力量的婦女大衆，才是婦女解放，抗戰勝利的基石。（灝）</p>

份人依舊留駐漢水兩岸，爲求得便於指揮，和給×人更大的一個敎訓起見，當局乃調使×兵聞之喪胆的湯恩伯將軍赴鄂北前綫指揮作戰，幹訓班的工作暫時則由李××代理。以幹訓班的同學講，這自然是個雖然興舊而又留戀的消息。興奮的當然是敎務長上前綫可叫敵人血染襄河，留戀的則是不願和這位聰明豪爽的師長做短期的離別。可是，不論怎樣，湯將軍已决定於明日登程矣。整個××鎭上充滿了火炬一般歡送的熱狂，街頭巷尾貼滿了各色的標語，口號，歌功英勇的戰績，預祝着征人的勝利。　　五點過後，在離鎭不遠的××裏已擠得人山人海，游擊隊的歌聲高響入雲，軍號震耳，每一個人的情緒都異常地興奮，會場裏已搭着戲台，据說今夜的節目非常精彩，有歌詠，有話劇，還有京戲……。記者在台上兜了一個圈子，上面擠着許多上海救亡演劇隊的靑年男女，他們吳語儂儂，不住令人憶起江南景色，現在則成爲×騎殘踏下的黑暗世界，非凡憤慨。一會兒，鼓樂齊嗚，全場肅然無聲，白崇禧，陳辭修，湯恩伯，周恩來，梁寒操等含笑步入會場，空氣由最高的緊張點逐漸開始下降，慢慢地大家是歡笑地相處於一堂了。所謂聚餐會亦接着開始，同學們東一堆，西一組，有坐有站，己皆吃起來了，記者和李蒙夫婦被邀坐於首席，吃飯的時候，李蒙問白陳二將軍南昌的戰事情况，囘答是我們已進展至城外飛機場，戰事頗爲有利。因此他倆希望能够隨軍進南昌，首先向全世界導報勝利的消息。席間大家的態度似乎相當嚴肅，破口大笑的事情簡直沒有，倒還是同學們來得高興。飯後，我們在招待室裏稍事休息，六點十五分開會，白崇禧將軍主席，說明了歡送湯敎務長的意思，接若便請湯臨別致訓，演講的內容，大槪是檢討過去的優點和缺陷，並以總理『做到老學到老』的精神鼓勵同畢於這一個多月中盡量努力，最後他還引用委員長所說『游擊重于正規戰』，白參謀總長所說『游擊隊是革命的幹部』，陳部長所說『游擊不能脫離民衆』等箴貴的名言來結束演講，和伸述同學們責任的重大游藝節目直至夜間十二時方散，這誠是深可記念的一天。</h3>

<p>春秋一個潛水手的自述　　死里逃生　　依照普通的例子，一個潛水手大約能好好地幹個七年，賺點錢。過了七年，還不撒手去享福，那就凶多吉少了。但是，這個說法，若擬到我身上來，那我眞算是幸運的了。我在七大海洋中，幹這行業，已整整的十六年，現在還在幹。　　可是，倒霉終於來了。我偶然的一個衝動，便跑到弗羅里達的大鵬灣去。那裏是美國港水手最咒詛的地方，但，我相信，我可以出奇制勝的去賺一票。　　大鵬灣是個小海灣，專門採海綿的地方。那兒約有一百五十艘採綿船，三百名採綿的潛水手。　　這些潛水手眞是好行業，只要走一點點好運，你出海一次就能帶囘二三百塊錢——這個，我後來知道，只是限於非美國人的好運道。如果你是美國人，你能够把身上的皮帶囘來，就是大幸了。　　許多美國潛水手勸我：『大鵬灣去不得，到了那裏，你會懊悔也來不及的。』　　他們吿訴我，那兒的勢力，完全是希臘人，三百多潛水手，頂多也只有五六個是美國人；希臘人怕美國勢力的進入，用盡方法的排擠美國人；割斷潛水索，劃破潛水衣，偷竊海綿，都幹得出。　　大鵬灣眞是個美國人的禁地。但是，記着，我幹了十六年，無往而不利，我相信，我去了，能跟希臘人混得好。　　到了大鵬灣，在那裏工作的五六個美國濟水手，又跑來勸我了：「去吧，快上四十歲的人了，爲什麼還上這兒來冒這樣險！」　　我堅持我的原意，留下了。整整的六個星期，我在海邊上流蕩着。每次有船開進口，我總去拉着船主，訴說我十六年的經騐怎樣潛入海底，怎樣拯救沉沒的潛水艇，怎樣幹人家都不能幹的事。　　每惆船主都冷冷地搖着頭，咕嚕若：『不講英語。』　　幾個美國潛水手也努力地幫我找，但一無成就。他們認爲我這樣坐以侍斃，眞是發痴，竭力慫勇我　開。　　最後，我終于弄到一個位置。那是一個大船，十四個水乎中，十二個是希獨人，黑彼得和我是美國人。　　我開心地去上任了，憧憬着出海一次，能帶囘來幾百塊錢。但當我把意思吿訴彼得，他說：「他們給你這個位置，不是給你來賺錢的，是來磨折你的。因爲他們不曾將　餓死，現在把你　到海裏去謀死。」　　彼得這句話，在晚上，我領略到點滋味。潛水手因爲工作煩重，身體一定要好，吃的要講究，我們的晚餐，却是一大盆魚，另外，除了一碟橄欖油，什麼全無。　　「彼得，」我說，「有刀又沒有？這樣我可沒法吃呢！」　　『哼』，他咕嚕着，『這些肉是乾净的。你是運氣的了，這裏的人總算還肯去掉手套來吃東西。吃吧，不然你自己挨餓去。』　　出海的第三天，我們開始入水工作，我第一次下去挺順利，那一帶海綿多極了，只下到一百廿尺，不一會，便把籃子裝滿了，我出水之後，看見潛水衣有點漏洞，我便向船主要求換一件，他只是聳聳肩。我明白了他的意思：我要是不高興幹的話，可以儘自泅囘家去。　　潛水衣一點漏，我也不大在乎，因爲只要衣內的空氣壓力充足，水是不大會進來的，頂多浸在腿部罷了。所以，潛水手通常跟船上管理空氣的人聯絡感情。如果，他手下一不留情，潛水手只有等死的。　　因爲聽得太多，我對於管理我的空氣的人，常懷若悸心。果然，當我第二次下水的時候，水透進了潛水衣，已濕到了背心了。這原只要幾磅壓力便能把水趕出去，但不知怎麼，一點空氣壓力也不下來。我竭力地當心，想減少水的浸入，但一灣腰採綿，一堆水便進來了。最後，水已浸到了我的腋下，空氣袋完全光了，我有點慌起來，趕緊拉動警鈴。他們把我飛快的拉上來　　我對這事大發脾氣，「聽着」我說，「把壓力校準。還有，當我己升到一百廿公尺的水面時，我要慢慢地升上來。」結果，他們表示，我的技術觀念跟他們不合，我幹不幹，他們毫不在乎。　　自　時起，我慢慢聰明了。希臘人决不會願意美國人來大應灣問津的，如果你一定要，你是自討苦吃。當我浸在水中吃苦的時候，我有點懊悔到大鵬灣的雄心了。我相信了彼得的話：「他們要永遠爲他們的族人保持這行業。不過，他們也不會硬把你害死，他們只是磨折你，也許把你弄個半死，那不更糟……」　　接着，我的苦頭來了，那恐怕是很少潛水手曾經經　過的苦頭。　　我第三次自水裏起來時，我被拉得更快了，在極重的壓力之下，潛水手的血液起了化學變化，如果突然脫離壓力，是會起一種「筋臠」的手病的，血液沸騰，賢臘破裂，頭腦充血；如果你幸運一點，你才能快快的死掉。　　我想盡方法叫他們別拉得太快，但，完全無用，我快在水中爆裂了。當他們把我自潛水衣中拖出來，我大肆咆哮。我吿訴他們，我要跟那些希臘港水手一樣地慢慢拉上來。　　我知道，這又是徒費唇舌的。如果我不高興，我可以不幹。　　他們遞給我一杯咖啡，當我正在喝的時候，突然間，我覺得胸部硬起來，跟一根鐵絲把身體綱緊了似的難過。　　從前我是患過『筋攣』的。「我患筋　了」。我大叫着。於是，我動都動不得，差不多呼吸都不行了。我模糊的覺得，他們又把我穿上潛水衣，拖到船尾，放下去，吊在五十尺的水中，好幾惆鐘頭　　我醒來了了，我明白，我要想上去，我就要大費勁了。我沒有戴手套，如果爬潛水素上去，手上的皮會一點不留。但除了爬之外，一無他法。於是，我便在四十尺與五十尺之間，一下一下的，爬了兩步，退兩步。後來，他們終於來把我拉上去——這次是慢了，才把身上的壓力平均過來。我的手掌腫的像豬排，耳朶也不靈起來。但我明白，這是我活該倒霉，埋怨是沒用的。　　可是，到了晚上，我又大大埤怨起來。依照規矩，當海綿賣掉，費用減去後，每一個潛水手是可以平分到一份紅的。但是因爲我是美國人，我採得的海綿，要分一半給船上，自已亦只分到一半。　　如果，我眞能够拿到一半，倒也罷了。可是，當我才離開我的海綿一分鐘，就有人來偷一點去。這叫我怎麼氣得過。　　我和船主大吵起來。吿訴他海綿是我拚命去採來的。並且，如果，希臘人一次能採到二百塊錢的海綿，我也辦得到。自然一　也不能偷去。　　船主不大能够說英語，但他做手勢，使我明白，如果我要獲得公平分配，那得先做幾件事：第一，我要捐五十塊錢給希臘敎堂。第二，我要化六十五塊錢自己買一件潛水衣。這樣，剩下來的，才是我的。　　這次海行十九天，給了我不少敎訓，吃了一場苦，帶囘來的，是消化不良與八十塊大洋。　　第二次出海，運氣更糟了。船主先允許我公平分配的——但到海綿賣掉之後，他却說蝕本了。我有什麼法子去證明他的說話，只好自認倒霉。　　我在大鵬灣蹲了六個月，天天担心着潛水衣的漏水，深海裏的斑鳩咬人：最令人恐怕的，還是那個管理我空氣壓力的人，每分鐘我在水裏，我都想着，我多留一天，多遭一天磨折。　　後來，我又來了一次「筋　」，我覺得我簡直在等待人家謀殺，便去找一個大鵬灣的官員，他說。如果我認爲待遇不公，我可以離開此地。　　最後，我明白我是沒法來打破這塊禁地了。我所以决定走，是在第廿五個星期那一次，我在一百廿尺的水中工作，原準備逗留一小時，但三小時之後，他們才拉我上來。　　當我上來之後，一切又來了，而且是利害的一種「　　」，眉毛都脫落了。他們又把我吊到船外，但沒有用。囘到岸上，我在鐵肺　躺了十九天。　　如果，現在誰要我去幹潛水的工作，我仍然很高興，只要不是去大鵬灣　啓：　　啓：今日介紹特譯長稿一篇。其他一切，只得暫停一天。莫索里尼舉行內閣會議海上風雲　勞頓上尉著　三  楊璧譯　　前文摘述　德美航　　線的快喻「凱隆齋柏號」，載着六百萬金條，開向德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅，一個他們以前救過的人。同時，傑克又與船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛交起朋友來。那時候歐局已經緊張……　　魯蒙加羅和傑克，從第一天在船面上遇見之後，又談過幾次話，他又會　復的吿訴探克，叫他注意，『在無線電中能知道些事。』一次，兩個靑年正在計劃到歌洲後的遊程，那位飛行家又神秘地說，「等你們能够到得了那裏再說罷。』這話的意思，他却不肯解釋明白，只吿訴傑克，到相當的時期自然會知道。　　第二天，鮑佛向傑克說：「若是我有一天假期，我要跑得離開這無線電越遠越好。我對於這個眞覺得　痛，一天到晚聽着它「的克！！的克」，發出去也一樣「的克！！的克」。哎，我又肚子餓啦。你替我看着機器，只消一會兒工夫，我去吃點東西就來。』　　這个大胖子德國人，從他頭上取下了聽筒，交給傑克，他就跑囘他那常時留好的許多食物，預備去大嚼的給裏去了。　　傑克　練的接下了聽，坐到海斯鮑沸的坐位上。『不錯，我眞是个傻瓜，』他微笑的自語着，『這無怪比爾要說我是癡子，在這个假期中，我第一件做的事，就是又囘到了我的職業上來。啊哈，有个消息來了。K·P·E·這是拍到我們船上來的。但是，很特引，這不像是商業上的口吻。』　　傑克大聲的問，『這是『凱隆伯齊」號，有什麼事？』　　『報吿你們的船長，將船泊在現在的地點，聽候吩咐。』是那方面的聲昔。　　『好，我佩服你的胆量，』傑克想，這或者是有人來和他開一个無線電的玩笑。『你不知道我們是由美國到歐洲的郵船嗎？你在你現在的地點繞繞圈子，等我們囘來的時候，或奢可以和你相會。』　　「不要管那些，服從命令做去！」　　『對，不要管那些玩意兒，我正忙着呢。搖斷它。』　　「別將事情看得輕忽，我們是英國巡洋艦「依莎」號，我們要來檢查你們。」　　『但是，你們不能阻止一艘郵船的進　呀。』經濟欄黑市外匯猛縮的原因  孫禮榆　　日昨匯豐銀行外匯掛牌行市雖然的守向來的基準、但是實際上暫停供給、因此謠諑紛興、買氣頓盛、一日之間竟由八辨士四分之一縮至七辨士左右、至於猛縮的原因、市場上傳說不一、有謂三月間設立的二千萬鎊外匯金業已用罄、有謂各友邦將不願繼續供給外匯、諸如此類惡意宣傳充斥市場、這實在是蓄意破壞法幣者與投機者另有存心的　言、絕對不足爲信、　　關於外匯基金的問題、據日方最惡意的估計、每月約須供給一百五十萬鎊、方才可以維持八辨士四分之一的水準、所以基金成立的時候、日方卽發表意見、以爲一千鎊基金僅能維持七八個月、然而外匯基金成立迄今不過二月餘、卽以日方惡意估計而言、也絕無用聲之理、所以這種謠言實在不足置信、　　英美各友邦與中國有密切的商業關係、决不願因爲法幣匯價的下落、影響其對華的留易、其中尤以英國更爲關切、過去的許多事實已足證明英國支持法幣的熱意、外匯基金的設立、更足以表示其維護遠東商業利益的决心、各友邦的商業利益旣完全與中國利益相一致、而中國抗戰又有反敗爲勝的徵象、則各友邦决無不願繼續維持法幣之理、所以這種謠言完全超出常識範國以外的、　　至於匯價猛縮的眞正原因、實在是破壞法幣的惡意宣傳與陰謀奸策、　　最近上海場市日鈔汎濫、價格下落、最低的時候、會經跌到法幣每八十九元可換日圓百元、這顯然的是日本經濟力薄弱的表現、日本名義雖說是戰勝的國家、但是在經濟上已經顯出不能與中國匹敵的事實、日本知道這是他的弱點的暴露、也就是中國長期抗戰勝利的徵兆、所以必須設法掩蔽、務使日圓的信用高出于法幣、然而他們雖然運用各種手段制止日圓的下落、終不能挽囘頹勢、日圓雖曾一度恢復到九十五元、（每日圓百圓的價格）、但是前日又下落到九十一元、他們知道日圓的信用是不易恢復的、於是轉變方向、攻擊法幣、想使法幣跌價以後、相對的恢復日圓的地位、　　同時『華興銀行』雖然從五月十六日起正式開始營業、但是因爲法幣信用的鞏固、所謂「華興券」者就不能獲得地位、從開始營業的日期起至五月底止、「華興券」的發行額只有二十二萬圓、並且都是用以徵發佔領區域內人民物資的、租界內始終未見其蹤影、日方知道此計不售、是由於法幣匯價的穩定、所以又擬攻擊法幣、間接的援助「華興券」、　　因爲上述的二　理由、最近日方就以其所收得的法幣（這是用「聯銀券」及軍用票換得的）、大批的　取外匯、從中國方面說、自從外匯基金成立以後、本來應付綽有餘裕、不過際此戰時、外匯的重要逾於往昔、如其聽任日方任意套取、無異是持械資敵、所以爲保持中國的元氣及防禦日本的陰謀起見、不得不限制外匯的供給、這是防護法幣的手段、非但對於法幣的信用無害、幷且反而可以革固法幣的基礎、　　從上述的情形看來、我們可知法幣的信用是毫無間題的、暗市匯價的下落實在是蓄意破壞法幣者的陰謀詭計、徜使大家承認法幣是本身利害之所繫、應該力持鎭靜、觀察事情的眞相、勿爲　言所惑、免得擾亂法幣信用、而自壞長城、本港商情　　昨　日　　倫　敦　一〇二·七五　　紐　約　二八·七五　　柏　林　七一·六二五　　巴　黎　一〇·八四　　上

<p>自由談文藝批評的一個路向  文俞　　抗戰文藝的活動，是依循着現實主義的指針，而新人的典型，新生的光焰又要以浪漫主義的手法，使他高楊，使他旺盛，要道樣，我們的文藝才能反映現實，認識現實，推進現實向未來的光明的前途發展飛躍，近兩年的抗戰文藝，是依從這偉大的路向，仕奉那崇高的理想，而獲得了相當的成果。　　可是，我們不能忽略在文壇上，還有着非現實主義的作品，比如我，還常常看得見許許多多的個人散紀，身邊瑣事，憂鬱的抒情，脫離時代的作品。這些東西，縱然雕飾得很美麗，然而晚掉外衣，便露出沒有生氣的殘駭。就是技巧確然巧奪天工，在這大風沙中，也還不　有它的存在。　　更要緊的是，文藝的非現實主義的作品，或陷人主觀主義的泥沼，或投進客觀主義的懷抱，它所反映的現實的眞實程度，便値得懷疑，如前已有人批評過一首「殺到東京去的詩，是「把中國這次神聖自衛抗戰變成報復主義，甚令變成侵略戰爭，由于熱情，他把抗戰的意義歪曲了。」（見祝秀俠「現實主義的抗戰文學論一）又如羅蓀在「抗戰文藝」週刊中，批評過一篇描寫白俄的小說，認爲是「同情的濫用」。而且在偉大現實中，光明與黑暗交織，是光明戰勝黑暗，還是黑暗戰勝光明？是光明從黑暗中抬頭，抑是黑暗把光明掩沒？作家要用現實主義的創作方法，才能反映出這現實的眞實，要不然便會成爲單純唯心的光明的歌讚，或是機械的對黑暗痛心，都不能透露眞正的新生而使之發揚了。　　文藝的公式主義的傾向，也就是作家不能運用現實主義的創作方法之所致，「公式主義不深刻地分析過程與人們，而止于純粹表面的特徵上」，倍斯巴洛夫這話，就可說明公式主義是非現實主義的了。　　對文藝的非現實主義的批評，就是使批評的武器能切實發揚威力，推動文藝運動的具體工作；而且使非作家因了戰友（批評家）的助力，獲得他們的再敎育。　　有人以爲抗戰文藝，以統一陣線爲基調，包含一切文藝流派，所有不願做亡國奴的作家，都要運用他的筆桿，作爲消滅日×漢奸，創造自由新中國的武器。這自然是的；然而這不能減削，也不應　削批評的力量，惆人主義的作品，假如是把個人和社會統一的聯結起來，也可予人以强烈的影嚮；但另方面，它會成爲閒適的，迷　的，反動的東西，不能不用批評的力量使之消滅。至于對現實　識和反映有　錯誤與不足的作品，可能引起不應有的反作用，批評更不該在它前面躱開。作家的工作是以形象反映現實；批評家的工作是分析作品與現實發展的過程，以掘露作品反映現實之眞實的程度。要兩者互相携手，共同前進，才能把文藝運動推展，把文藝的效能發揚，而對于非現實的作品的批評，並不是把它掃除打倒，把他同漢奸文　一樣對待，宗派主義的作品當然要排除；用誠墾嚴肅的態度指出作品的缺點及其根源，指出作家在創作方法上的失着，導引作家向現實主義的抗戰文藝大道前進，這正是批評家的中心任務。譯完了『愛國者』以後  朱　　我很早就作了賽珍珠女七著作的讀者。我常常驚異於一個外國的作家，能把我們中國的人情風俗，觀察得那樣仔細，描寫得　麼逼眞。縱然在她的作品中間，　還有着過於誇張甚至難免錯誤的地方，然而我以爲對於一個異邦的作家，似乎不應該苛求得那樣厲害。尤其自從她獲得了諾貝爾文學獎金以後，我更慶幸　的成功。賽珍珠女士的獲得諾貝爾獎金，雖然頗有人訾議，雖然也頗有驚奇，但是我相信，獎金的授予，决不是兒戲的事，那是一定有她應得獎金的業績，和她應得獎金的理由，不容我們置疑的。現在我更高興我已作了賽珍女士新著『愛國者』的譯奢了。　　我譯「愛國者」的動機，是異常單純的。有一次，我在某一家西書鋪裏發現了一本賽珍珠女士的新著「愛國者」，約略看了一下那篇附印在包書紙上的說明，知道描寫這一時代中國動向的作品，於是不問好歹　立刻買了囘來。費了幾個晚間，我把「愛國者一通篇看了一遍，覺得寫的很動人；然而我當時並無把它譯成中文的意思：一則因爲我正在繙譯法國馬爾勞的「人的希望」，决無再譯他書的餘暇；再則因爲我知道那樣一部好書。一定會有人着手繙譯，似乎不心再凑什麼熱鬧。然而我畢竟又大凑熱　從事　譯者，那完全是幾位朋友　勵慫恿之功。有一個晚上，我和巴金先生在某處晚餐，就談起賽珍珠女士這部新著的事，我只表示這種名作，應該介紹給中國讀者；而他便接着說，這種　譯介紹的工作就應該由我去担任啊。後來又另外幾位朋友談起，他們都鼓勵我卽刻着手繙譯這一部新著。於是我竟一開工」了！二十多萬字的一個長篇，居然在我斗室中開始給我譯成中文了。一經着手，成績頗使我駭然，利用每天的餘暇，倒也譯成不少。接著便有好幾家書店向我接洽，願意接受出版；這些書店中間，我就選定了萬葉，朋友唐齊馮奎兩先生，他們本也有意繙譯該書，看見我忙，就來帮我合譯。感謝他們；有了他們的合作，這個譯本才會在今天呈獻於讀者之前。　　「愛國者」的題材，異常新穎；不僅描寫北伐以後的情形，抑且描寫到抗戰以後的動態；不僅描寫艱苦奮鬥的中國，抑且描寫到存心叵測的日本。「愛國者」的故事，也異常復雜；不僅描寫如火如荼的革命，抑且描寫到緾緜悱惻的戀愛；不僅描寫到中國家庭中的糾粉，抑且描寫到日本軍隊中的風紀。而『愛國者』的人物，尤其包羅得　廣；有殷富人的巨賈，有赤貧的工農；有失意的將軍，有革命的公子；有英勇的鬥士，有無恥的漢奸；有卓識的丫鬟，有無聊的文士：有日本的商賈，有德國的夫人；有白俄的司機，有美國的駕駛員——有最使我們驚服不止的是，蔣委員長也是本書人物之一；他的言行舉止，都被直接描寫在政事中；把委員長寫作小說中的人物，我想這恐怕還是第一次吧。　　原著的好壞，我想還是留待讀者去批時。不過在譯筆方面，我是向來主張儘量依從原著，然而又須儘量使中國的讀者（注意，我們讀奢都是中國人！）看得明白的。無論原者如何偉大，如果譯成了連中國讀者那看不懂的中文，我相信原者的偉大，還是顯不出來反之，那是多麼　辱原著的作者！然而限於個人的學識，難免有不妥的地方；而且一經排印的手續，又决乎難免魯魚的錯誤，那是應得向原著者以及讀　致歉的地方。　　感謝豐子愷先生，因爲他答應爲我們的譯本作畫。也感謝讀者，假如能夠指正和批評。轉變  徐庶　　當有人笑我　老先衰的白髮時，我用沉默來代替歎息。是的，我有一頭蒼老的白髪，我有一個衰弱的身體，我還有一顆寂寞的心。　　在冷酷的黑夜裏，在澹黃的桐油燈下，我歡　獨個兒偷着流淚。在叢密的山林中，在澄淸的小溪畔，我歡喜唱起我自己的歌。　　我愛春天。幽谷裏的野花使我神往：我也愛秋天，狄天裏的落葉是我遊伴。　　……　　而今這裏偏是一個什麼也沒有的地方。　　聽着室外卡車疾駛聲與樓下房東太太咒詛聲合成的交響曲，我病倒在床上了。病魔糾　着我，像一個陰險的禁了監視着他　囚徒：這時我已經流完了我純潔的淚。　　這是一個暴雷，這　雷粉碎了我的灰色之夢。　　一封打滿了黑色油印的信，來自遼遠遼遠的故鄉，我朦矓地睜開我惺忪的睡眼，父親嚴正的字句向我警醒：　　「……强盜侵佔了我們的故居，强盜焚燒了我們的山林，强盜活埋了你的哥哥，强盜使你的弟弟當……員去了，……」　　汗滴下來。洗滌着汚黑的棉被：然而，我沒有流淚，　是早已商完了的。半夜裏，像一陣野火燒透了我整個的身體：然而，我已沒有呻吟，也沒有歎息。　　我有的是憤怒，只是憤怒！　　……　　眞想不到我又能繼續活在這世上。　　我不會忘記我自幼長大的家鄕，我也不會忘記被后埋的哥哥，我更不會忘記在英勇地奮鬥着着的弟弟和流離奔波中的爹娘。　　我不相信多病的身體就不能負起槍，我也不相信自己冷寞的心靈就堅定不不了的决心。我霍地起來奔出去了！從成都到西安  林煥平　　三、如此軍人　　司機這番話也滿有道理。因爲第一，車上只有司機人壓車人各一員，所謂壓車人就是修理機器的技術人員，的確沒有賣票員，何况　人擲出的十元，實際上也並非是買藥的意思，不過是「我打賞你們司機的十塊錢酒錢吧」吧了。　　第二，汽油缺乏，車子停開，客人在成都化多少錢都買不到票，在半途想買票，那簡直是夢想了。那軍人立刻怒火上冲。眼睛放出閃光：「狗子的！車子不載抗戰軍人載什磨？我要槍斃你！」　　他一邊這樣怒罵（這時我才聽出他是操的純粹四川口音），一邊拔出了手槍來，對準書司機。車上的兩個小女孩驚慌得一媽呀！一的哭然起來了。車上的男客看見不對勁，深怕弄出亂子，連忙跳下車去，把兩固人拉開了，給他們歡道：　　「大家都是中國人，別這樣——」　　「大家都是出門人。相就相就就是——」　　「媽那個×！狗子的！這個地方是我負責的，我的隊伍在前方打仗，車子不給我坐給誰坐？這太可惡了！徇子的，你看我槍斃你不槍斃？」　　軍人一壁這樣雜亂無章地怒氣冲沖地罵着，一壁就爬上車去，揀一個好位坐着了。　　司機也怒氣冲冲地舉手揚足，拉拉衣袖，亂罵着：　　「他媽的！我怕你的手槍？他媽的！我怕你的手槍就不是人養的！……」　　但也無可如何，終於跳上車去，把車子開走了。　　根據後來在車上的談話，才探出那個軍人不過是一個營長，他的隊伍在鄂北前綫作戰着。　　四、蜀道難　　剛才軍人和司機差不多演成武行的恐怖，很快就烟消雲散了。這不是爲的什麼特別原因，正是大家的靈魂，被兩傍的風光吸引住了。　　車行約三十里，卽爲有名的石佛山。山甚高，又雄偉，遍山都是石佛，大半是自然生成，而略加人工修飾的。舉目四望，狀極美觀。山麓下有一小溪，溪水淙淙，反饗于山谷中，又是一種悅耳的自然昔樂。路沿溪邊而行，是鑿穿岩石，像隧道一機的山路，其與隧道不同者，卽爲不是地洞，臨溪那一邊是空的，也沒有石住助力，故甚危險；且路面離洞頂不高，乘客須留心低頭，始可通過，否則，頭頗有被石壁碰破的危險。　（未完）祖國頌  郭尼迪　　像一個躺倒的巨人挺昂而起，　　是你，我們底熱愛着的祖國！　　你，過去光榮的，　　未來美麗的，祖國！　　你是不可被征服的　！　　你底遼闊的疆七上，　　炫耀着戰鬥的火花，　　熊熊的光燄中，　　暗濁的陰影消失了，　　誕生出一朶燦爛的奇葩，　　在艱苦的掙扎里，　　千萬人底呼　，　　在地球底一角，　　激盪着！　　你底脈搏充滿着，　　靑春的輝煌的，　　鼓舞與懽躍！　　生命底力，　　合羣的生命底力，　　在你底鋼體上　　不可遏止的　　像火山岩一樣地爆發了！　　我們庇蔭在你母翼下的子孫，　　祈求着，爭取着——　　你底束縛了的身體的解放！　　爲着全人類最寶貴你的　　幸福與自由，　　×××××××！　　從痛苦的深淵中，　　拯救你，　　拯救被壓迫的我們自己！　　是人和××交搏的前夜了，　　祖國，你將究破世　底黑暗！</p>

<h3>Quiet Beihai (Special Dispatch from Beihai)</h3>
<p>— Wang Hetian</p>
<p>When we arrived at Hepu City, it was as if we had stepped into an uninhabited wasteland, a dead city after a bombing catastrophe! Bombed streets, broken walls, and even the few complete shops had their doors tightly shut and locked. A terrifying atmosphere enveloped every corner—and the next morning, eight enemy planes came again for a frenzied bombing. However, when we ran to Beihai, thinking that it would be more dangerous in a place under the enemy's guns, the situation turned out to be beyond our expectations. Not only did we not feel terrified, but on the contrary, the tranquility of Beihai was rarely seen in Guangdong cities. The French-style streets were still neat and orderly, and we didn't see a single bombed house. If it weren't for the sparse pedestrians on the streets and the shops half-closed, I would have almost forgotten that this was Beihai under the threat of enemy guns. Why is it that this place, so close to the enemy, is so peaceful? What is the reason? After two days of observation, I deeply felt that Beihai harbored a serious crisis.</p>
<p>I. The Current Situation in Beihai</p>
<p>Beihai is the largest commercial port in the Gulf of Tonkin. Its sea routes connect to Annam in the south and Hong Kong in the east. It is an important town on the southern route and a seaport for Guangxi. France, England, and Germany all have consulates here, which shows the prosperity of its commerce. In the past, it was changed to a city. Now it has been abolished. The entire town has thirteen bao and twenty-nine thousand two hundred and forty-nine people, but due to the threat of enemy planes, many citizens have moved to the countryside. Although foreign merchant ships still frequently come and go to Hong Kong, most of the shops are closed. Some are afraid to purchase goods, selling off remaining stock with their doors half-open, as if waiting for an opportunity. Moreover, some large merchants have deposited their goods in foreign consulates or foreign-run hospitals, observing the situation.</p>
<p>Political Mobilization</p>
<p>In terms of administration, Beihai has had considerable success in training and conscripting young men in the past. Furthermore, the youth here consider serving in the military a glory. Fifty-five strong men volunteered to kill the enemy. Preferential treatment was implemented for the families of soldiers on expeditions. Committees for preferential treatment for the families of soldiers on expeditions were organized, cash condolences were held, and each family was given two yuan per month. Four schools for the children of soldiers on expeditions were established, offering free education. In terms of education, private schools were changed to public schools. In the supervisory district, teachers from various schools organized mobile education teams, implementing compulsory education in densely populated areas. Literacy classes for the masses were established in various schools within the supervisory district, and with the help of comrades from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, everything was proceeding smoothly in each village. Speaking of mass mobilization work, such as destroying highways and assisting the army in building fortifications, the response was quite enthusiastic. However, the village and bao-jia organization was too unsound, and mass mobilization work was still insufficient.</p>
<p>II. The National Salvation Work in Beihai</p>
<p>In the past, Hepu County was the most enthusiastic and successful area in the national salvation work in Beihai. There were as many as ten drama troupes in the national salvation organizations. However, after the threat from the enemy forced the relocation of the first middle school of Beihai and Hepu, the national salvation work also came to an end. It gradually stagnated, either due to financial difficulties or the harsh environment. Currently, only the Fifth District Anti-Japanese Support Association's wartime service corps and the Women's Anti-Japanese Association are still doing some work. The rest of the groups have ceased operations. Recently, the Women's Anti-Japanese Association launched a "selling flowers to save the nation" campaign, which raised more than two hundred yuan. They used the funds to comfort the border defense troops and present a banner to the border defense troops, encouraging the soldiers defending the territory. In addition, they held first-aid training classes to prepare to participate in frontline rescue work.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Sentiment Among Dock Workers</p>
<p>What comforts me the most is that, under such circumstances, the comrades of the defense army's political work team have mobilized hundreds of dock handcart workers to organize and participate in the Anti-Japanese Association. Handcart workers are organized into groups, each with a group leader who regularly calls meetings. On May Day, they implemented the National Anti-Japanese Covenant. Because of their living conditions, they did not understand what an association was. When the Dock Workers' Association was established, they elected officers, but they did not understand what "officers" meant and were not used to calling them that. Therefore, they called the officers of the labor union "the foremen of the foremen." This is truly an interesting term!</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the Barbers' Anti-Japanese Association and the Mass Night School Students' Anti-Japanese Association. Besides publishing a weekly wall newspaper, they have not shown much work performance.</p>
<p>III. The Crisis in Beihai</p>
<p>Although Beihai is a flat coastal area with no defenses to speak of, and the enemy could land at any time, the defense army, under the mission of "defending the country is the duty of soldiers," has already done much in strengthening anti-enemy efforts. The Beihai authorities should organize and arm the entire population to assist the defense army in fighting to defend their homes!</p>
<p>One District, Three Public Offices</p>
<p>However, the highest organs in Beihai are the Fifth District Office, the Police Bureau, and the Beihai Town Public Office, and they are not doing enough in this work. Furthermore, there is a lot of friction among them. Originally, the latter two organs were under the command of the District Office, but the Police Chief thought that he was also appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs and did not consult with the District Office when doing things. The Town Public Office thought it was the local master, with power and influence, and did whatever it wanted. There were even conflicts of interest, with the Police Chief beating the Bao Chief, and police soldiers and the self-defense corps almost fighting each other over women. Recently, the Town Chief accused Li XX, the head of the town's militia, of ten crimes because of smuggling. In short, these kinds of friction are being exacerbated by the instigation of traitors, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>The Smuggling Problem</p>
<p>Some say that the loss of Guangzhou was due to smuggling in Danshui. Today, Beihai has the same phenomenon. Although there are customs and a small number of anti-smuggling personnel here, the coastline here is long and impossible to defend against. Furthermore, smuggling here is organized and protected by local armed forces. According to investigations, the masterminds behind the smuggling are unscrupulous merchants, and some town and village chiefs are semi-openly smuggling in Dianbai Liao, Baihu Tou, Gaosha Long, Longtan, Daguan Sha, Nankang, and Lemin Po Wei, etc. The Beihai Fifth District Office once detained the village chief of Shangsha Long for smuggling. Because of smuggling, customs revenue has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Cheap Goods Flood Villages and Small Towns, such as kerosene, which sells for only six or seven yuan a case in Nankang, but sells for more than twenty yuan in Beihai. The Beihai Town Second Bao Militia confiscated eight barrels of smuggled kerosene, but the Town Chief, in the name of the brigade commander, forced them to hand it over. Later, the Town Chief awarded the Second Bao thirty yuan in prize money, saying that the goods had been returned to the original owner. But what happened to those eight barrels of kerosene? They didn't know. In the evening, I specifically went to the coast to inspect the defense army and the militia on patrol. Unexpectedly, I saw the police also on the beach. Originally, there were no police posts on the beach, but why did they come here? Later, an investigation revealed that they also had other business—in short, smuggling in Beihai is becoming increasingly serious. If no way is found to eliminate it, perhaps Beihai's life will be cut off by the evil hands of smugglers.</p>
<p>The Activity of Traitors</p>
<p>Since the cracking of the case of traitor Mai in Dongxing last year, who confessed that the boss of a gold shop in Beihai was also a traitor, everyone has paid attention to the activities of traitors in Beihai. However, because the environment here is complex (there are consulates of various countries and foreign-run hospitals), and our political institutions are not strict, even the police bureau has stopped registering residents' movements, which gives traitors more opportunities to sabotage the national salvation work. For example, when the Women's Anti-Japanese Association organized reading classes for prostitutes, the traitors immediately sabotaged it, saying that the government wanted to conscript prostitutes into the army, scaring them from daring to come to school. Also, when handcart and dock workers formed an organization, they were threatened by traitors, and they didn't even dare to mention the words "anti-Japanese." Local big merchants are preparing to live as obedient subjects and are storing their goods in foreign consulates, while preparing for the fall of Beihai, and organizing a refugee relief association with foreigners. Furthermore, since the case of Pang Kuanfu, the boss of Heyi Company, smuggling enemy goods—sulfide ore (fifty barrels)—last year, the government has not dealt with him, and the unscrupulous merchants are even more blatantly sabotaging the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The Problem of Fishermen's Relief</p>
<p>Since enemy warships entered the Gulf of Tonkin, the first to be hit were the fishermen, especially after Weizhou Island fell into enemy hands for the second time. No less than one or two thousand fishermen have died at enemy hands. Now they dare not go out to sea to fish, and the lives of fishermen who depend on the sea for a living are becoming more difficult every day. Furthermore, the enemy often uses small favors to lure the fishermen. Learning from the past lessons of Luodian and Haiyan, we have paid attention to the relief of fishermen. However, although it has been proposed at the joint meeting of the party, government, and military in Hepu, there is no conclusion, which is also a serious problem.</p>
<p>In summary, Beihai is harboring a serious crisis. Now we must overcome this crisis and defend Beihai. We must (1) adjust the personnel of party and government organs; (2) strengthen the leadership of Beihai's national salvation work and implement the wartime mass mobilization plan; (3) promote the movement of earning well; (4) thoroughly solve the fishermen's relief problem. Because Beihai is the gateway to the rain road and the outer defensive line for defending Nanning, if these problems are not resolved, the crisis in Beihai cannot be overcome.</p>
<h3>The Flag Selling Campaign and Creating a New Era of Adult Education</h3>
<p>— Lei Peihong</p>
<p>Since the "July 7th Incident" broke out, the people of the entire Republic of China have stepped onto the path of not hesitating to make any sacrifices in order to earnestly fulfill the great way. This is the path of national liberation. Although this path is circuitous and full of difficulties and obstacles, there are milestones in the near or distant future that clearly indicate the way, so that travelers will not get lost or lose their way. World history tells us that since the 18th century, the tide of national liberation has been rising, with one wave after another. Only people who are living in a drunken stupor, indifferent to order and chaos, and unconcerned about pain or pleasure, will lose their way and stray into the wrong path leading to a premature death. Only people who abandon themselves and give up on themselves, belittling themselves and willingly accepting failure, will fall behind and ultimately be eliminated by society. If not, if some people can constantly remind and alert themselves to the degree of national liberation, and also struggle together, their future will be bright and far-reaching, and their efforts will not be wasted, but will surely reap great rewards. The culmination of this great harvest is the success of national liberation.</p>
<p>Specifically, this time is a chaotic and deeply painful period that the Chinese nation has never encountered in its history. The handling and resolution of such chaotic and deeply painful period will undoubtedly provoke a fundamental change in future Chinese society. The details of this fundamental change, at present, we will not discuss in detail, and we cannot discuss in advance, but in any case, this change, generally speaking, can be said to be inseparable from its essence. That is to say, our highest ideal is "to seek freedom and equality for China"; and its greatest success is the realization of national freedom, equal civil rights, and the happiness of the people's livelihood, in order to establish a society of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>Under such important circumstances, we must establish an adult education system that creates a new era, so that we can control new developments and respond to new requirements. On the term "adult education system," we prefix it with "creating a new era," which is nothing more than to point out a key point, namely: ordinary school education is not enough for the tasks assigned by the new era; and the general public or the current adult education, which emphasizes literacy education, is of course even more insufficient. Education is a process by which an individual joins society, and in order to effectively participate in social life, an individual must have a full understanding of the ideals and goals of that society. In today's society, the largest and most important organizational unit is naturally our country - the Republic of China, and the most common and ordinary social life is none other than the national life of the Chinese nation. As for our social ideals and goals, in addition to the former being mentioned above, and regarding the latter, then during this national liberation movement, it is nothing more than: "Nationalism above all else; the nation above all else; resistance first; victory first; concentration of will; concentration of material resources." These are all living teaching materials, and must be practiced by the people of the whole country in their lives. These are all of fundamental importance in today's society and constitute the main themes of education, and must be done by all members of the nation on a down-to-earth basis. Unfortunately, the current school education focuses on the traditional curriculum, and general adult education, including mass education and social education, is nothing more than an emphasis on the popularization of literacy education. Because of this, even if these types of education can be realistic, they are not enough to inspire the masses, so that they can fully understand society and effectively participate in social life. Therefore, an adult education system that creates a new era must be established. Based on this, education and life can be effectively linked, and the mission of national liberation can be completed.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, the importance of the flag selling campaign and its social value can be understood without much explanation. Originally, "the origin of the flag selling campaign, in a nutshell, is extremely ordinary, extremely small," this is what Mr. Wu Hanzhen told us. Following this, he also described the course of the flag selling campaign, and discussed the keys to the success and failure of mass movements. He earnestly pointed out: "Today, those who can mobilize the masses and mobilize the masses are not those who just talk the talk; but those loyal people who usually forget their own interests, truly serve the masses, seek benefits for the masses, and solve problems for the masses." He further painfully declared: "You are for the masses, the masses want you; you are for yourself, the masses leave you." These are all valuable experiences gained by Mr. Wu Hanzhen from the mass movement work. If he allows me to add a word, that is to say: This is the moral lesson that our adult educators have gained from participating in social movements.</p>
<p>Originally, in such a turbulent society, all interactive behaviors and common behaviors are the most difficult to organize. Even if the organization is temporarily successful, it is easy to lose its original organization. If we do not immediately find ways to remedy it, these behaviors will have no way to initiate or continue to develop. Here, first, let's talk about flag selling from the perspective of flag selling, and then talk about the national salvation movement from the perspective of the flag selling movement. I am extremely grateful to the flag selling vendors in Hong Kong. Let me first declare that this is not an emotional statement; on the contrary, it is a conclusion drawn from an objective attitude and an analysis of the facts. Specifically, the Hong Kong flag selling movement initially originated from two fruit vendors in Sham Shui Po, then influenced twelve vendors, and then promoted to the Sham Shui Po district and the Mong Kok district vendors' flag selling. Before there was flag selling, this group of vendors were originally individually operated vendors. From the perspective of common sense, they not only did not communicate with each other, but were also easily aroused by their respective competitions. Under such circumstances, interactive behavior and common behavior were originally extremely difficult to promote. However, for the sake of saving the Republic of China, for the sake of saving our compatriots, one vendor after another, inspired by righteousness and driven by patriotic and people-loving enthusiasm, were able to unite. Thus, flag selling became an interactive behavior, and the flag selling movement became a common behavior. At this moment, we can imagine that this group of vendors will inevitably encounter obstacles from time to time. And from the perspective of the secular eye, they are ignorant and uneducated, and can be called "commoners." However, no matter what dangers there are ahead, they still firmly uphold the central purpose of these interactive behaviors and public behaviors; no matter what difficulties they encounter, they can always overcome these difficulties with a pure, naive, and enthusiastic heart and a courageous and forward-looking spirit. The result is that this group of vendors has become patriots who save the country and the people, and have become benevolent people who love the country and the people. From the perspective of the adult education movement, this is not only a success in the self-education of this group of vendors, but also a new creation of the old experience of social life. Furthermore, from the perspective of the national liberation movement, this is not only a great contribution from the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, but also the supreme glory of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Question of Japan Joining the Anti-Communist Alliance</h3>
<p>— Wan Zhongwen</p>
<p>This is an old story from more than forty years ago: When Japan was interfered with by the Triple Intervention and began to advocate for concluding an alliance with Britain, Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu, who had been out of office for a short time, wielded his sharp pen despite his illness and published an article titled "The Wedge of Diplomatic Alliance" in his magazine "Japan of the World," saying that it was too early to talk about an Anglo-Japanese alliance. He said:</p>
<p>"The Anglo-Japanese alliance, its name is very beautiful, and the expectations of the people of the time are also very great. However, Britain is not a Don Quixote who worries about the worries of others and saves people from their urgent needs; Japan wants to obtain security guarantees through the alliance, and Britain must also obtain the same guarantee. If this guarantee cannot be given, then Britain will never become a country in the alliance. I sincerely do not know whether the debater believes that Japan's current national power can provide security guarantees for Britain's infinite defense line? ... At the time of the Liaodong incident, the Ito cabinet looked ahead and behind to wait for Britain's statement, so that Britain made a statement to express the meaning of the alliance, then the Ito cabinet would also be determined to secretly leap forward and try its hand at a quick thing; Britain did not do this, but instead hoped that the Ito cabinet would listen to the proposals of the three countries. Is this not an example of Britain's position in the East? ... Therefore, if Japan's military strength is not much different from today, then the so-called Anglo-Japanese alliance is just a dream, just vanity, just a painted cake." (Published in August of Meiji 28)</p>
<p>In this paper, Mutsu has gently pointed out several requirements for alliance diplomacy: First, equality of interests, second, equality of power, and third, equality of guarantees. These requirements are the only basis for judging whether alliance diplomacy can be established. Taking the past history of European alliance diplomacy as evidence, it is all the same. Talking about whether the enemy country wants to join the German-Italian-Japanese anti-communist military alliance recently, they can also make such observations.</p>
<p>Of course, on the surface, in order to cut off the aid of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to China, so as to achieve the desired results of its war of aggression against China, Japan has the need to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. However, in practical terms, this issue of alliance diplomacy is very subtle and complex, and not as simple as some people imagine.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of interests. Japan's central interest lies in the invasion of China, and the invasion of China has not yet reached the stage of direct conflict with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union that cannot be resolved without war in the current and near future. Although Japan is also clamoring to advance south and seize all the colonies of Europe and the United States in the Pacific, this is just exaggerated propaganda by young soldiers and emerging politicians. In fact, does Japan need this at the moment? Does it have the ability? Even if it is seized, can it be permanently maintained? All are problems. The financial capitalists and the old and important ministers who ultimately determine Japan's national policy must not rashly regard the exaggerated propaganda of the young soldiers as a program of action. Therefore, Japan's interests are very different from those of Germany and Italy, because for its own interests, Japan can not participate in a large-scale world war with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, but if it is allied with Germany and Italy, then Japan will inevitably participate in the Second World War for the sake of Germany and Italy's interests in Europe and Africa. The cunning Japanese xx will never do the "heroic" work of Don Quixote, who sacrifices himself and worries about the worries of others and the urgent needs of others.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of power. If Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, it will inevitably use the power of its entire army, navy, and air force in the future war to confront China, which has been resisting for a long time, to the north to confront the Soviet Union, a large country with a large army, and to the south to confront Britain and the United States, a large country with a large navy. Germany and Italy in distant Europe cannot divide its equal power with equal power. Only Japan supports it alone in the Far East. This is a one-man show that Japan wants to sing but cannot.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of guarantees. Due to the inequality in the combat power of the three countries, their guarantees are also unequal. If Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, then the guarantee that Japan gives to Germany and Italy is heavier than the guarantee that Germany and Italy give to Japan. Even if Japan is very stupid, it is not willing to lift this heavy and tasteless "single stick."</p>
<p>Judging from the above three points, it can be seen that Japan does not seem to be participating in the completely automatic German-Italian military alliance at present. Japan's future diplomacy towards Germany and Italy is more possible and necessary, only the following three items:</p>
<p>The first is to conclude an alliance diplomacy with Germany and Italy that is specifically aimed at the Soviet Union, the content of which is similar to the first Anglo-Japanese alliance, that is: If Japan goes to war with the Soviet Union alone, then Germany and Italy will maintain good-neighborly neutrality; if other countries provide military assistance to the Soviet Union because of the Japanese-Soviet war, then Germany and Italy must provide military assistance to Japan. Its role is to limit the inevitable Japanese-Soviet war in the future and achieve victory, which is also similar to the first Anglo-Japanese alliance.</p>
<p>The second is to use the axis of the original Japanese-German-Italian anti-communist political agreement to launch coordinated diplomacy at an appropriate time, so as to negotiate the Far East issue with Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union and obtain a guarantee for the established results of the invasion of China. Mutsu Munemitsu would say: "Japan can be tolerant of the powers but cannot relax a step towards China." This is Japan's clever traditional diplomatic strategy!</p>
<p>The third is to use the anti-communist axis to wait for changes in the international situation and play a set of diplomatic piracy in the event of a fire. In the Second European War, even if Japan does not participate in the German-Italian war and remains neutral, it can also use this pivotal position to threaten and blackmail Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These three future policies of the enemy country are closely related to our country's war of resistance, and are worthy of our serious vigilance. Although we cannot objectively change the diplomatic policy that the enemy is bound to pursue, we only have to prepare for more bitter sacrifices, make greater determination, firmly and confidently resist the war, eradicate all obvious surrenders to the enemy, and get rid of all opportunistic ideas of waiting for the international situation to end the war. From the independent war of resistance, we will strive for independent diplomacy, so as to deal with the enemy and others who are bravely and unyieldingly to the end, and realize the supreme requirements of the war of resistance and nation-building!</p>

<p>Shanghai Dispatch: Over six hundred workers at the Lun Chang factory, obstructed from resuming work by the puppet regime, are appealing to all sectors for help to facilitate their early return to work and secure their livelihoods.</p>
<p>British Government Lodges Strong Protest with Japan [Reuters, London, 13th]</p>
<p>The diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle, Mr. Baddaley, declared today: "The British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to warn the Japanese government that the Anglo-Japanese conflict in Tianjin is dangerous. I believe the impasse caused by the British refusal to hand over four Chinese individuals to the Japanese in the Tianjin concession could be resolved by forming a commission with equal representation from Britain and Japan, chaired by a neutral party. This commission would examine all evidence and make a final decision on whether to hand over the Chinese individuals. If the Japanese refuse this suggestion to resolve the matter, it will inevitably lead to more serious incidents."</p>

<p>Japanese Attempt to Develop North China - Japanese Government Approves So-Called Three-Year Plan [Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 13th]</p>
<p>According to a Japanese announcement today, the North China Development Company has been approved by the government to implement a so-called three-year plan, aiming to develop the plains east of the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi Province, and other projects. It is reported that the budget will include the construction of 3,000 kilometers of railways in North China, approximately 600 kilometers of railways in Inner Mongolia, construction of ports in North China covering an area of approximately 2.5 million square meters, and the mining of 7 million tons of coal, 1 million tons of pig iron ore, 1 million tons of lime, 50 million tons of steel, 2 million tons of cotton, and 500,000 tons of wool in Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Weariness of War [Fancheng, 13th]</p>
<p>The Japanese army has suffered casualties of 7,343 in recent battles around the Dabie Mountains. The elite Fujie Division has suffered the most significant losses. The commander of its affiliated Yamada Kizang Regiment was killed in action northeast of Zao Yang. This has led to widespread war weariness in the Japanese army, which has gradually manifested in anti-war actions. Even the Japanese authorities cannot deny this and are reportedly considering countermeasures.</p>
<p>Bishop Yu Bin Broadcasts Speech, Calling on Americans to Aid China, Relieve Chinese Refugees, and Assist Economic Construction - Audience Exceeds Ten Million [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th]</p>
<p>New York, May 24th (Airmail): Since the opening of the New York World's Fair, all prominent figures from various countries passing through New York have been invited by the fair to give broadcast speeches. On the evening of May 23rd, at 10:00 PM, the fair invited Bishop Yu Bin to broadcast, reaching an audience of over ten million. Bishop Yu's speech covered three main points: (1) He praised the Pittman Neutrality Act amendments, believing that they would effectively ban the export of military supplies to aggressor nations and expressed gratitude for Pittman's sympathy towards invaded countries and his support for China. (2) He stated that the most urgent task was to relieve Chinese refugees. During the great famine in Tsarist Russia, the United States donated $70 million. Now, China is bravely resisting aggression for national independence and human justice, with 30 million refugees facing unprecedented misery, yet receiving only one million dollars in donations. Given the strong ties between China and the United States, and China's fight for democracy admired by the U.S., he hoped all Americans would rise up to help. (3) Since the start of the war, China has been actively promoting economic development in the northwest and southwest provinces, with boundless potential for future growth. He hoped Americans would actively invest. The original speech was quite lengthy and was widely reported by newspapers the following morning.</p>
<p>A Brief Comment: "Meeting Force with Force for Those Who Like to Use Force"</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, the British Foreign Secretary declared in the House of Lords: "Britain must meet those who like to use force with force." This statement will undoubtedly resonate with every Briton who truly loves Britain and peace. If this statement can be earnestly implemented, it can thwart the schemes of warmongers and safeguard British interests and the world's peaceful order, whether in Europe or the Far East. However, the question is whether the Foreign Secretary's statement will remain just a statement, and whether it will be undermined by other compromising conditions. For instance, in his speech on the 12th, the Foreign Secretary expressed a stronger stance towards Japan, stating: "The British government will issue a stern protest to Japan regarding the lives and property of British citizens in the Far East, navigation, and the Shanghai International Settlement." But if this is merely to reassure the domestic population without the preparation and the actuality of 'meeting force with force for those who like to use force,' then it will only allow those who like to use force to freely exert their power! Amidst the serious situation in the Tianjin and Shanghai concessions, British and French Far East land, sea, and air forces will hold a meeting in Singapore, and the friendship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is also greatly increasing. May everyone join forces to implement 'meeting force with force for those who like to use force!' If China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union can truly cooperate, it can be asserted that 'peace can be achieved without bloodshed!'"</p>
<p>The Issue of the Existence of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library</p>
<p>The question of whether to maintain or abolish the public library run by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will be discussed at today's general meeting. We have seen restaurants, tea houses, theaters, dance halls, and even "businesses that lead people to depravity" flourish in Hong Kong in recent years, without any forceful condemnation from society. Yet, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library, which educates the public, enlightens the ignorant, and benefits society, is facing the question of its very existence. We are not only shocked and indignant, and feel it is unjust to the thousands of readers of the library, but also deeply concerned about the cultural level of Hong Kong residents and worried about the future of society! Therefore, for the sake of culture and the future of society, and for the reputation of Hong Kong and its million-plus residents, we sincerely hope that the proposer withdraws the original motion to abolish the library. We also hope that people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, will work together to provide moral and material assistance to develop this only library that benefits those who are hungry for knowledge. We also sincerely hope that social leaders from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, will make further efforts to establish a large-scale library so that Hong Kong can also join the ranks of world-class metropolises in terms of culture!</p>

<p>Japanese Side Claims to be Dealing with Britain Alone [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th]</p>
<p>Foreign sources received information from Tianjin that a spokesman for the Japanese army in Tianjin declared to the press on the 12th that the Japanese army authorities are dealing with the British Concession in an independent manner, with a particularly severe nature. According to Japanese newspapers in Tianjin, the main points of the economic blockade of the British Concession are as follows: (1) Prohibiting ships from sailing to the British Concession. (2) Inspecting all foreign nationals entering the British Concession and reviewing their passports, but Britons will not be allowed to enter or leave. The French Concession remains calm as usual, and the authorities do not appear to have taken any special measures.</p>

<p>Military Authorities Promulgate Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War</p>
<p>Resisting Japan is Not Against All Japanese Soldiers - Treating Prisoners of War Emphasizes Leniency [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd]</p>
<p>Our country has always valued peace and universal love. Even in this sacred war of resistance, we have always adhered to the principle of leniency in treating prisoners of war, as we deeply understand that our enemy is the Japanese militarists, not all Japanese soldiers. Now, our military authorities, fearing that the military and civilians across the country may not fully understand this principle, have extracted important articles from various "Regulations on Prisoners of War" and formulated "Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War" for promulgation. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War</p>
<p>(1) All Japanese military officers and soldiers captured on the battlefield who voluntarily disarm and renounce combat are entitled to the treatment of prisoners of war.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese military officers and soldiers captured by us should be immediately handed over to the nearest higher-level command and then transferred to prisoner-of-war camps by the rear service department. They should not be detained in combat areas for long periods.</p>
<p>(3) The period of detention of prisoners of war by command agencies at all levels shall not exceed the provisions of Article 7 of the Measures for the Handling of Wartime Prisoners of War and Spoils of War.</p>
<p>(4) All field detention centers should be located at least 25 kilometers away from the front lines to ensure the safety of prisoners of war.</p>
<p>(5) Prisoners of war should be treated the same as our military and civilians and their dignity and reputation must be respected.</p>
<p>(6) Anyone who injures or kills prisoners of war without cause shall be punished for the crime of injury or murder.</p>
<p>(7) Wounded prisoners of war, regardless of the severity of their injuries, should be properly treated immediately.</p>
<p>(8) When occupying Japanese positions, severely wounded prisoners of war should be rescued and sent back to the rear for treatment and must not be killed.</p>
<p>(9) Except for weapons, horses, military documents, and military equipment, which may be searched and confiscated, all other items carried by prisoners of war shall not be confiscated.</p>
<p>(10) The living conditions of prisoners of war should be treated according to their rank, with equal treatment given to those of the same rank in our country.</p>
<p>(11) The quality and quantity of food for prisoners of war should be the same as that of our soldiers.</p>
<p>(12) Sick and wounded prisoners of war may be given special diets according to their health needs, but this must be done in accordance with the procedures prescribed by doctors.</p>
<p>(13) The clothing and bedding equipment of prisoners of war should be kept clean at all times, with emphasis on hygiene.</p>
<p>(14) Prisoners of war should be allowed a certain amount of exercise to maintain their health.</p>
<p>(15) Prisoners of war should not be interrogated immediately after being captured. Before interrogation, their anxiety, worry, fear, and self-abandonment should be dispelled to create a harmonious atmosphere for them to provide accurate testimony.</p>
<p>(16) Prisoners of war who are uncooperative or attempt to cause trouble may be punished in accordance with the current Army Criminal Law of our country.</p>
<p>(17) When interrogating prisoners of war, a sincere and friendly attitude, as well as careful and tactful patience, should be used to elicit information. If a prisoner of war is unwilling to answer formal questions in detail, it is not necessary to press them for answers.</p>
<p>(18) All documents issued to prisoners of war should be in a language that the prisoner of war understands or should be explained in detail to ensure clarity.</p>
<p>(19) The true name of a prisoner of war may be kept secret if the prisoner of war does not wish to disclose it.</p>
<p>(20) Prisoners of war may be given free postage for mailing letters, etc.</p>
<p>(21) Prisoners of war should not be disturbed by visitors or frequently photographed, as this would harm their self-esteem.</p>
<p>(22) The Party's ideology and history, military situation, international trends, and the situation in Japan should be explained to prisoners of war at any time, or compiled into periodic publications and pamphlets to be provided to prisoners of war for long-term reading to ensure transformation.</p>
<p>(23) Prisoners of war may exchange information with their families or friends or send money and clothing, but the administrator has the right to inspect them.</p>
<p>(24) Prisoners of war who attempt to escape or have escaped and are recaptured, or who have escaped into Japanese territory and are recaptured, shall still enjoy the treatment under these measures.</p>
<p>(25) If any prisoner-of-war administrator fails to handle matters in accordance with these measures, the prisoner of war may file a complaint with the highest military administrative agency.</p>
<p>National Government Orders [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th]</p>
<p>The National Government issued the following orders on the 13th:</p>
<p>(1) Tang Guangqi, Counselor of the Military Council, is assigned to another post. Tang Guangji is hereby relieved of his current position.</p>
<p>(2) Tang Bohu is appointed as Advisor to the Military Council.</p>
<p>(3) Yan Xiangquan, Colonel of Infantry, and Lu Jijie, Colonel of Cavalry, are promoted to the rank of Major General of the Army. Wang Qingzhong, Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry, is promoted to the rank of Colonel of Infantry in the Army.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem of the War of National Revolution (Part Two) - Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Ye Quesun</p>
<p>Guerrilla Cadre Training Class</p>
<p>The number of students in the training class is over a thousand, including many women. The students are mostly mid-level cadres from the troops, such as battalion and regimental commanders, as well as young students. Many are young men and women who have been engaged in national salvation work or participated in battlefield service during the war of resistance. In short, they are all capable friends selected and recommended from various places. They are divided into several teams, with some teams mixed with female students and others exclusively for male students. The dormitories are divided into multiple locations. The daily work schedule is eleven hours, waking up at five in the morning and going to bed at nine-thirty in the evening. The day includes seven hours of academic subjects, one hour of physical training, two hours of group meetings, one hour of self-study, and half an hour of extracurricular activities. The principles of life are wartime-oriented, guerrilla-oriented, and full of hard work, resilience, and a lively and strong spirit. Because politics is more important than military affairs, spirit is more important than material things, and practical experience is more important than knowledge from books, the instructors in the cadre training class mainly come from three sources: (1) The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission; (2) Eighth Route Army cadres with guerrilla experience; (3) Central Military Academy instructors with excellent technical skills. There are many talented people, truly gathering heroes from all over the country. Their distant future and magnificent contributions will be evident from this.</p>
<p>General Bai Chongxi, the director of the cadre training class, told reporters: We want to make students deeply understand the meaning of war. This war is different from all other wars, such as the wars of the past, which were merely massacres caused by the desire for the benefit of a few people or the expansion of a certain country. China's war is a revolutionary war, a bitter struggle in which we have had to rise up to resist aggression for the freedom, equality, survival, and independence of the nation. Because it is a revolutionary war, it includes comprehensive tactics in politics, economics, culture, military affairs, and education. Our methods of fighting are different from those of other countries. Others must have a rear, but we not only do not distinguish between front and rear, but also send people to the enemy's rear to turn the enemy's rear into our front line. Others' wars require everything to be prepared before they can start fighting, but we do not need to constantly calculate the comparison of military strength. We must grow in war and develop in the midst of artillery fire. Therefore, the purpose of our founding of the cadre training class is to cultivate a new batch of cadres, expand guerrilla warfare, and coordinate and realize comprehensive warfare. Mr. Bai smiled and was full of spirit. Finally, he said: "I have just returned from inspecting various provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian, and have lectured in various places on the importance of guerrilla warfare in the second stage and how to strengthen guerrilla forces." The reporter silently assessed that this man was truly a talented person.</p>
<p>The work of the graduates of the cadre training class will be nothing more than: (1) Returning to their old homes ravaged and slaughtered by the Japanese to destroy the Japanese; (2) Cooperating with the army to do various political work; (3) Uniting exiled young people to organize basic teams for political, economic, and cultural counterattacks. The guerrilla cadre training class is truly a furnace that produces new forces and unleashes guerrilla functions. From a military education perspective, this is also a product of historical contribution and a great era. We hope that more schools of this nature will be established.</p>
<p>On April 29, the Japanese increased their troops to Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and other areas in central Hubei. Part of Tang's army remained stationed on both sides of the Hanshui River. In order to facilitate command and give the Japanese a greater lesson, the authorities transferred General Tang Enbo, who instilled fear in the hearts of the Japanese soldiers, to the front line in northern Hubei to direct the battle. The work of the cadre training class was temporarily taken over by Li XX. For the students of the cadre training class, this was naturally a message that was both exciting and nostalgic. The exciting part was that the director of education could go to the front line and let the enemy stain the Xiang River with blood. The nostalgic part was that they were unwilling to have a short-term separation from this intelligent and forthright teacher. However, in any case, General Tang has decided to depart tomorrow. The entire XX town was filled with a fiery enthusiasm for the farewell, and the streets and alleys were covered with slogans of various colors, glorifying his heroic achievements and wishing the expeditionary soldiers victory.</p>
<p>After five o'clock, the XX River not far from the town was already crowded with people. The songs of the guerrillas soared into the clouds, and the bugles shook the air. Everyone's emotions were extremely excited. A stage has been set up in the venue, and it is said that tonight's program is very exciting, including songs, dramas, and Peking opera. The reporter walked around the stage and saw many young men and women from the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe, speaking in the soft Wu dialect, which could not help but evoke memories of the scenery of Jiangnan, which has now become a dark world trampled under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, causing extraordinary indignation. After a while, the drums and music sounded together, and the entire audience fell silent. Bai Chongxi, Chen Chengxiu, Tang Enbo, Zhou Enlai, Liang Hancao, and others stepped into the venue with smiles, and the atmosphere gradually began to decrease from its highest point of tension, and slowly everyone was laughing together. The so-called potluck dinner also began, with students gathering in groups, some sitting and some standing, and everyone began to eat. The reporter and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were invited to sit in the first seat. While eating, Li Meng asked General Bai and Chen about the war situation in Nanchang. The reply was that we had advanced to the airport outside the city and the war was quite favorable. Therefore, they hoped to follow the army into Nanchang and report the news of the victory to the world first. Everyone's attitude seemed quite serious at the banquet, and there was simply no loud laughter. The students were still happier. After the meal, we rested in the reception room for a while. The meeting began at 6:15. General Bai Chongxi presided over the meeting and explained the meaning of the farewell to Director of Education Tang. Then he invited Tang to give a farewell speech, the content of which was roughly to review the past advantages and disadvantages, and to encourage the students to work hard as much as possible in the spirit of "learning as long as you live" advocated by Sun Yat-sen. Finally, he also quoted Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's saying "Guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare," Chief of General Staff Bai's saying "Guerrillas are revolutionary cadres," and Minister Chen's saying "Guerrilla warfare cannot be separated from the masses" to end the speech and elaborate on the great responsibility of the students. The entertainment program did not end until 12 o'clock at night. It was truly a memorable day.</p>

<p>British House of Lords Heatedly Discusses Aid to China - Demands Government Retaliate Against Japan - House of Commons Also Debates International Situation</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th]</p>
<p>The House of Lords continued its foreign policy debate tonight. Lord Cecil rose from the opposition Labour benches and stated, "The contradictions on the two continents of Europe and Asia are absolutely the same. Only Asia is caught in a cruel vortex of war, while Europe has not yet suffered the scourge of war. I believe Foreign Secretary Halifax must share this view. Whether it is legitimate to use force to invade another country to obtain one's own material or governmental interests is a major issue that urgently needs to be resolved. Asia is now at war, with Japan invading China with unparalleled cruelty. Some in Germany must be extremely envious, but Europe will not allow the realization of such atrocities today. I would most earnestly wish the Foreign Secretary to provide assurance that we should do our best to assist China, expel Japan from Chinese territory, and not merely express the Foreign Secretary's personal sympathy for China. I deeply believe that every member of this House deeply sympathizes with China." Lord Elibank then spoke, stating, "The situation in the Far East is worse than at any time before. The traditional British trading area, the Yangtze River basin, is no longer accessible to us, while Japanese commerce is unimpeded. The Japanese issue counterfeit currency to disrupt finances and stipulate that the value of the Yokohama Specie Bank's currency is equal to the Chinese national currency and must be used. The Japanese have achieved some success because, in any case, people need to live. Regarding trade from Shanghai to British and American ports, I hope the government will guarantee the issuance of consular certificates to facilitate trade in British ports. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China have caused great disturbance and unease among British citizens in the Far East, and I hope the government will pay attention. If the Japanese implement a blockade of Tianjin, the government should immediately notify the Japanese government that Britain will also stop Japanese ships from using Singapore and Penang as transportation ports as retaliation. This is an absolutely legal action under international law. The Japanese are destroying our trade in China, and unless we take military action, this action of stopping Japan from using British ports is necessary. Recently, incidents between Britain and Japan have occurred repeatedly, and British citizens have died. I really do not know how to stop this. At a time when such incidents are constantly occurring, it is surprising to hear that a battalion of British troops stationed in Shanghai will be withdrawn in mid-September. Two battalions of British troops are already insufficient to defend the perimeter of the Shanghai International Settlement. If another battalion is withdrawn, the Japanese will surely see Britain as showing weakness and attempt to seize it, as they have done in Tianjin and Gulangyu. As far as I know, the rumors that Japan is plotting to seize the Shanghai Concession are not entirely unfounded. July 7th is the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, which is a dangerous date. It is unwise to reduce our troop strength. We should send more troops and warships to ensure the safety of the Shanghai Concession. This action should be discussed jointly with the American and French authorities. The Japanese believe that occupying Chinese people under the protection of foreign flags is the best way to eliminate anti-Japanese movements in China. This has been done in Tianjin and Gulangyu, and it now appears to be about to be added to Shanghai. Once this happens, trade in Shanghai will be completely eliminated because Chinese people will quickly withdraw from Shanghai and go to the interior. Japan's seizure of Shanghai would not only be a fatal blow to Britain, but also a major blow to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Therefore, I urge the government to take effective action early, before it is too late." Lord Davies then rose and stated, "Expressions of sympathy alone are insufficient. Small loans to China and allowing China to transport arms are commendable, but Foreign Secretary Halifax should take the lead in responding to Chinese representative Gu Weijun's appeal in Geneva. The current British policy has undermined the British Empire's inherent reputation for upholding justice." Foreign Secretary Halifax replied to the above questions separately, stating, "We are witnessing the conflict in the Far East, which is related to the entire issue of the rights of war. The British government has been constantly making efforts to deal with the war in the Far East in the past two years. The resolutions passed by the League of Nations, although their content is still far from the wishes of the Chinese government, are practically feasible for countries whose interests are significantly related to the Far East. Lord Davies has underestimated the efforts of the British government. Those familiar with the China issue should know that Britain's efforts to assist China's monetary system are a great help to China, enabling China to maintain the balance of its economic strength. Regarding the repeated destruction of British interests in China by the Japanese, the British government will resist any threat from any party. The difficult position in which the British government finds itself should be understood by Lord Elibank. I can assure him that the withdrawal of the upper army is completely unfounded. Regarding the deployment of the fleet stationed in China, the commander-in-chief of the fleet will act as he sees fit. Although the Japanese military authorities constantly use "military necessity" as an excuse to limit British rights, this is unacceptable to the British government, especially in some areas where military operations have long ceased. Other matters, such as unilateral changes to institutions organized by Britain and other countries, are also difficult for the British government to accept. The questions raised in this debate have all been raised to the Japanese side through notes or protests. The British government will make greater efforts to ensure that the rights and lives of British citizens in China are protected. Regarding the Captain Spiers incident, regardless of the Japanese excuse, he should be released immediately once his identity is proven. According to a report from Cooper of the British Embassy in China, although Spiers was detained, he is still receiving proper treatment. I predict that the Captain Spiers incident will be satisfactorily resolved. Regarding the Tinker incident, a protest has been lodged by the British Ambassador to Japan, and all rights to compensation for losses are reserved. Regarding the entire global situation, I have made a statement in my speech on June 8. British policy remains unchanged. What the British government wants to make clear is that those who use force against others today will be resisted by force. British-Soviet negotiations are currently underway in Moscow by Sir William Seeds, and I am unable to discuss them in detail at this time. Future progress will be announced. Regarding the Danzig issue, we must be more patient if we want to avoid the results of serious danger. I now reiterate Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that while Britain wishes the German-Polish dispute could be resolved peacefully, any attempt to threaten Poland's independence by force will lead to a major war, in which Britain will also be caught up."</p>
<p>British-French-Soviet Negotiations Delayed - Chamberlain Expresses Regret</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th]</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that no further additions to the report on British-Soviet negotiations were necessary, Labour MP Dr. Dalton immediately rose and questioned whether the Prime Minister had considered that the prolonged delay in the British-Soviet agreement had caused doubts in all quarters, and whether the government intended to procrastinate again in an attempt to restore its Munich policy. Chamberlain jumped up and angrily replied, "Dr. Dalton's question is deliberately slanderous. Can the delay in the agreement be blamed solely on Britain?" Labour MP Henderson then questioned what conditions must be met to convene a world conference that could genuinely resolve international problems. The Prime Minister replied that such an international conference must be attended by countries that are open and willing to resolve disputes through negotiations in order to be effective. The British government is still willing to make efforts in this regard at any time, and other governments must also work together. In answering questions about the Thetis submarine, Chamberlain stated that salvage work would restart within two or three weeks. Labour MP Fletcher rose amidst cheers from opposition members and asked if the Prime Minister was aware that the people were extremely eager for the government to salvage the submarine as soon as possible. Given the success of salvaging German sunken ships in Scapa Flow, the failure to salvage the Thetis submarine would inevitably cause a sense of serious unease. Chamberlain replied that the government was also eager to salvage the submarine.</p>
<p>Questions About the Tinker Incident - Butler Reports Progress [Reuters, London, 12th]</p>
<p>The case of Mr. Tinker, a British employee of the Shanghai Lun Chang Spinning Mill, who was stabbed to death on June 6 due to a conflict with the Japanese Marine Corps, was brought up for discussion in the House of Commons today. Under-Secretary of State Butler, after describing the events of the Lun Chang Spinning Mill strike on May 20, stated that on June 6, Chinese employees of the factory clashed with striking workers at the gate of the factory in Pudong. The Japanese Marine Corps then intervened. The facts are not yet clear, but Tinker appears to have fired a shot in an attempt to stop the conflict. Tinker was then stabbed by Japanese Marines with bayonets and died of serious injuries the following morning. The British Consul-General in Shanghai protested to the Japanese Consul-General regarding Tinker's stabbing, the Japanese authorities' refusal to return Tinker to the British authorities at the British authorities' request, and the Japanese authorities' refusal to allow British doctors to treat Tinker when his injuries were still minor. The British government also sent a note to Tokyo protesting these discriminatory actions against British citizens. All information that could be released has been provided to British and international news agencies. Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the government authorities had taken note of the fact that the Japanese searching British ships, seizing British property, and other anti-British actions had caused great public unease and whether there were preparations to take other steps besides protesting. Conservative MP Allan asked whether the government had made efforts to seek the truth of this matter. Butler gave an affirmative answer and said, "The reason we provided the information we obtained to British and international news agencies is precisely for this reason." Fletcher also asked whether the British government had the possibility of taking retaliatory measures. Butler said that the British government had already protested, so it was now appropriate to await the results. In answering a question from Labour MP Robart, Butler said that according to the information Foreign Secretary Halifax had received, Hainan Island was only partially occupied by the Japanese army. Regarding the Japanese on the Spratly Islands, there was no real military occupation. The British government is constantly maintaining close contact with the French government on this matter.</p>

<p>Japanese-German-Italian Conspiracy in the Works - Shiratori Arrives in Germany to Participate in Talks - Japanese Delay Causes German Dissatisfaction [Reuters, Berlin, 13th]</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Shiratori, will arrive here today to meet with Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Oshima, to discuss Japanese suggestions to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. In the past few days, Mr. Oshima has visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop several times. It is heard that Germany has expressed dissatisfaction with the delay in the negotiations, while Japan is more optimistic. The Japanese proposal was delivered here a week ago, but has not been made public.</p>
<p>Basic Techniques of Aggression - Germany Mentally Abuses Czechs - Czech Soldiers and Civilians Flee to Poland - Organize Secret Groups to Resist Germany - Germany Still Denies Formal Annexation of Czech Republic</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th]</p>
<p>Rumors that the current protection system in Bohemia and Moravia will be abolished and that the two provinces will be incorporated into German territory were denied by those responsible here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 12th]</p>
<p>Information was recently received from the Czech border that Czech army officers are crossing the border into Poland in an endless stream. Many people from Bohemia and Moravia are also fleeing to Poland. According to reports, Czechs are organizing secret groups to resist Germany. Polish newspapers are paying close attention to the situation in Bohemia and Moravia, stating that the Czech resistance is becoming more intense and will become an international issue. In addition, the hostility of the Slovaks towards Germany is also increasing, and conflicts between the two groups are occurring frequently.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th]</p>
<p>Czech Ambassador to France, Mr. Osusky, recently stated in an interview with a reporter from "Le Jour" that the Czech nation has been wantonly trampled upon by other countries and is no longer an independent nation, but has become a part of Germany. German leader Hitler solemnly declared on March 16 of this year, the day after his country annexed Bohemia and Moravia, that he would respect the independence of the Czech people. At that time, there were no atrocities committed in the province under German rule. Czech civil servants were still able to remain in their positions, and the people were not mistreated. However, times have changed, and the previous words have been overturned. Recently, many Czech employees in public and private institutions have been dismissed and replaced by Germans. The people's possessions and food have been requisitioned, and goods have been confiscated. Iron, livestock, timber, sugar, etc., must be confiscated. Cloth is scarce and prices are skyrocketing. Meat is no longer affordable for ordinary people. Families with moderate wealth have become impoverished. What is even more unbearable is that the Czech people have been deprived of their basic freedoms, and patriotic movements have been banned. German Minister Frank publicly declared yesterday that the Czech people have no right to enjoy independence and that their only responsibility is to work hard and seek the welfare of Greater Germany. However, the Czech people will never be willing to submit to this kind of abuse.</p>

<p>Hong Kong News: Submarine Water Pipe Hong Kong Section Completed; Full-Day Water Supply Restored; Kowloon Section to Face Water Suspension for Three More Days During Pipe Connection; Entire Project Expected to Be Completed by Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>To enhance the water supply to Hong Kong, the Waterworks Department has installed a submarine water pipe to transport water from the Shing Mun Reservoir to Hong Kong. This installation project began in November last year and has lasted for several months. As of now, the submarine pipe has been installed. On the Hong Kong side, only a few remaining sections need to be connected to the main pipe underground at Queen's Pier for completion. To facilitate the connection work, the Waterworks Director announced a temporary water suspension for three days, starting at 9:00 PM on the 11th of this month, with only ten hours of water supply per day. During the water suspension period, the connection of the main pipe was completed. According to Waterworks Director Wood, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the connection of the main pipe underground at Queen's Pier was completed this (yesterday) morning. Full-day water supply will resume as scheduled from 4:00 PM this (yesterday) afternoon. In the future, when the new pipe is connected to the main pipe underground at the Kowloon Railway Station, the Hong Kong area will again face a temporary water suspension for three days. This section of the project is expected to be completed by mid-next month. The new pipe has a larger diameter than the old pipe and is specially manufactured to be durable and non-corrosive, with an effective life of over ten years without replacement. The total project cost is approximately $900,000. After the new pipe is installed, the water supply from the Shing Mun Reservoir will be temporarily increased by one million gallons per day. Once the "Shing Mun Reservoir Plan" proposed by the water authorities is completed, the daily water supply to Hong Kong can be increased to 1.6 million gallons. The installation of the new submarine pipe is closely related to the "Shing Mun Reservoir Plan."</p>
<p>Hong Kong Women's Relief Association Branch Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Collecting Small Antiques to Send to England for Sale; Decision to Send Letters Inviting Various Organizations to Participate in the Charity</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Women's Relief Association held a committee meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Shen Huilian, the General Affairs Director of the General Association, attended the meeting to report on the general work of the General Association over the past two years. Attendees included He Baofang, Wu Yanzhuang, Xu Jun, Liao Mengxing, Yan Cheng, Rong Yuzhi, Hu Mulan, Du Ruolian, Wu Yazhi, He Xiangning, and Zhu Xianzhen. Shen Huilian and Ye Shaoshang attended as observers. Xu Jun chaired the meeting, and Wu Yanzhuang served as the recorder. The meeting commenced with Shen Huilian's report, providing a detailed account of the General Association's work over the past two years and the recent rescue of children, including the following key points: (1) After the July 7th Incident, Madame Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened women's organizations to form a relief association, engaging in relief work with great enthusiasm. (2) After the retreat from Nanjing, witnessing the suffering of children under the abuse of × people, the association felt deeply saddened and established a children's welfare society to shelter and care for the children. (3) Women's work teams were added to serve the war zone and frontline soldiers. Despite enduring great suffering, the soldiers expressed no complaints and were deeply grateful for the full service of the women's community. Currently, there are thousands of wounded soldiers, many of whom are disabled from bombings. While the soldiers' food is good, they lack shoes, socks, clothes, and handkerchiefs, requiring urgent assistance. There are over 17,000 war orphans, all with strong nationalistic sentiments. Chongqing has been making every effort to accommodate them. Those aged fifteen or sixteen are mostly engaged in quarrying or agricultural work and other productive activities. (4) After Chongqing was brutally bombed by × aircraft, the morale of the military and civilians in resisting the war increased. Previously, the people of Sichuan were slow to rise in the morning and indulged in opium. Since the national government moved to Chongqing, their lives have improved. The recent disaster resulted in over 10,000 deaths and injuries. Ms. Shen also suggested that the children's welfare society should provide as much accommodation as possible to disaster area refugees, providing them with mental training. The lack of medicine is particularly acute, and she hopes that all parties will make efforts to donate. She also mentioned that during her trip to the south, she was instructed by Madame Chiang to collect small domestic items and antiques to send to London for sale, using the funds to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. She urged the Hong Kong branch to take responsibility for planning and implementation to facilitate the process. The General Association deeply admired the efforts and outstanding achievements of the Hong Kong branch in its past work. The Standing Committee decided to send letters to prominent women and organizations in Hong Kong, including Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, Madame Kung Soong Ai-ling, Madame Soong Chang-lo Yi, Madame Liao He Xiangning, and Madame Wu He Baofang, inviting them to participate in the charity together. A tea party was scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 16th to discuss the arrangements. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully," Yesterday, we received a letter from Madame Chiang, stating that Madame Guo Taiqi, wife of our ambassador to England, wrote that charity sales are the most effective way to raise funds abroad for our country. She requested that women in the country be mobilized to donate small items for sale in England. However, due to × aircraft bombings in the interior, people are constantly moving, making it difficult to collect items there. She instructed us to launch a collection campaign in Hong Kong to contribute to the good cause. We have scheduled a discussion meeting for 4:00 PM on the 16th of this month, with light refreshments, to show our respect. We respectfully request your presence at the meeting to plan the arrangements together. Thank you."</p>
<p>Cholera Cases Increasing in Hong Kong; Ships Leaving Hong Kong for Xiamen Must Enter Restricted Waters for Inspection</p>
<p>The health authorities reported that on Sunday, ten new cases of cholera were reported in Hong Kong, bringing the total to seventy-seven cases. On the same day, there were also seven new cases of typhoid, four cases of measles, one case of meningitis (imported), one case of postpartum fever, five cases of dysentery, and twenty-seven cases of tuberculosis. According to a notice issued by the Assistant Colonial Secretary's Office yesterday morning, the Xiamen Customs authorities have announced that all ships arriving from Hong Kong must enter restricted waters for inspection due to the cholera outbreak in Hong Kong. Passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Egypt by plane must also have a certificate of cholera vaccination, otherwise they will be detained for inspection. The authorities of the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements have also announced Hong Kong as a port where cholera has occurred, restricting the freedom of passengers arriving from Hong Kong to disembark.</p>
<p>Zhonghua Yixue Announces Teacher Appointments; 144 Teachers to Be Appointed in Hong Kong and Kowloon First; School Opens on the 18th, Report by the 15th</p>
<p>The Guangdong Relief Committee's Hong Kong and Macau War Refugee Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to war refugees who have dropped out of school and unemployed teachers in Hong Kong and Macau, has established Zhonghua Yixue and conducted a registration of unemployed teachers. A total of 1,520 teachers registered. Later, 300 were selected using a priority method and a lottery method. However, due to the current number of classes set at only 132, not all of the selected teachers could be employed. Therefore, the committee, in order to find a flexible solution, has decided to first employ 144 teachers from the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas according to the order of priority and lottery selection. Those who have not been employed will be employed when the number of classes is increased in the future. The list of teachers who have been employed was released yesterday. The committee also sent a circular stating that they must report to the committee office before the 15th of this month. The list and circular are recorded below:</p>

<p>Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to Discuss Today: Question of Library Retention</p>
<p>Achievements Have Been Improving Since Its Establishment; Proposal to Close Is Incomprehensible</p>
<p>The public library run by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has been established for several years, and the number of readers has been increasing daily. Compared with the number of readers in 1929, the increase in the number of readers has reached over 70,000. From this, it can be seen that the number of illiterate people is gradually decreasing. However, in the midst of this growing success, some people have proposed that the library's existence is a waste of funds, which is incomprehensible. Since the question of the library's retention has been raised, it has not only aroused the resentment of the Chamber of Commerce's directors but has also been criticized by public opinion. The proposers have been attacked, and it is generally believed that such reckless actions should not be taken during the war. The question of the library's retention will be raised for discussion at today's general meeting. The general public hopes that the proposers will withdraw their proposal. A systematic statistical survey comparing the number of readers and the number of books borrowed over the years is as follows: (1929) Number of readers: 37,953, Average daily: 145; Number of books borrowed: 44,753, Average daily: 172; (1930) Number of readers: 45,753, Average daily: 165; Number of books borrowed: 62,322, Average daily: 224; (1931) Number of readers: 53,854, Average daily: 184; Number of books borrowed: 72,299, Average daily: 247; (1932) Number of readers: 56,162, Average daily: 96; Number of books borrowed: 74,690, Average daily: 261; (1933) Number of readers: 58,205, Average daily: 212; Number of books borrowed: 78,073, Average daily: 285; (1934) Number of readers: 53,310, Average daily: 189; Number of books borrowed: 72,219, Average daily: 256; (1935) Number of readers: 67,038, Average daily: 226; Number of books borrowed: 151,750, Average daily: 511; (1936) Number of readers: 81,910, Average daily: 297; Number of books borrowed: 111,426, Average daily: 476; (The number of books borrowed was slightly reduced this year because the library was used as an office for the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese's celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday and the dedication of aircraft memorial meeting, and the library was closed for about a month.) (1937) Number of readers: 102,977, Average daily: 351; Number of books borrowed: 183,709, Average daily: 627; (1938) Number of readers: 118,354, Average daily: 434; Number of books borrowed: 244,141, Average daily: 894.</p>
<p>Air Raid Siren Sounded the Day Before Yesterday; Not an Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 12th, the air raid siren in the Central District suddenly sounded, with a wailing sound that lasted for 30 seconds. Pedestrians along the way thought that the authorities were suddenly conducting an emergency air defense drill, but it stopped shortly after, and there was no special situation in the city. After inquiring with the Air Defense Headquarters, Steve Lubekins stated that the sirens that had been transported to Hong Kong recently were placed at designated locations. The sudden sounding was not an air raid drill. It was probably due to the alarm being moved to a fixed location, which touched the current, causing a short sound.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Yesterday; Two Inches of Rain Received; Total Rainfall This Year Reaches Over 46 Inches</p>
<p>Hong Kong experienced heavy rain yesterday morning, with a total rainfall of over two inches. Rain fell from 0:00 AM to 9:00 AM yesterday morning, with a confirmed rainfall of 2.645 inches. As of 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the total rainfall in Hong Kong this year was 46.35 inches. The rainfall during the same period last year was only 29.34 inches, which is 17 inches less than this year.</p>
<p>Kowloon Peninsula Pig Farming Issue; Authorities Determined to Ban; Villagers Petition to Revoke the Ban; Approval Refused; Second Petition Submitted</p>
<p>For the sake of protecting the health of residents and facilitating sanitation administration, the Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau recently implemented the 1935 regulations banning pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula to avoid affecting the health of all residents and hindering sanitation administration. However, due to the impact on their livelihoods, the villagers spent a great deal of money to hire Lawyer Deakin to appeal to the authorities to revoke the ban. After receiving the Deputy Governor's reply, Lawyer Deakin informed Huang Yangyou, the manager of the Kowloon Chinese Chamber of Commerce, that since the authorities were determined to ban pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula, the villagers who wished to continue animal husbandry and cultivation must move to several designated alternative areas in the New Territories. However, few of the villagers are wealthy, and the cost of relocation and establishing a new business in the future is difficult to resolve. It is better to request the authorities to take into account the difficulties of the people and have the government purchase all the existing fields and houses in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula so that they can use the funds to relocate. After consideration, this move is sufficient to delay the authorities' implementation of the ban, which is an opportunity to be taken, and it is also a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, they paid another handling fee of $100 and submitted another petition to the authorities based on this reason, requesting the Hong Kong government to consider a solution. However, the farmers declared that requesting the government to purchase all the fields and houses was no different from seeking their own death. The villagers generally did not express sympathy for this move, and the progress of this matter did not obtain the consent of the farmers, so they all held different opinions. Moreover, the traditional Chinese virtues of honesty and integrity mean that they would never be willing to destroy the ancestral property unless absolutely necessary. If the authorities ban pig farming, they can still raise livestock such as chickens and ducks and continue their pastoral life, maintaining their future livelihoods and living in peace and prosperity. Moreover, the impossibility of relocating to the New Territories has been explained in detail by the person in charge of the Planting Research Chamber of Commerce and published in major Hong Kong newspapers a few days ago, so there is no need to repeat it. Therefore, the villagers did not consider Lawyer Deakin's appeal to the authorities to be acceptable. Even if the authorities approve the request in the future, it is believed that none of the villagers will be willing to comply. It can only be regarded as Huang's personal opinion. The reason why we spent our hard-earned money to raise funds for negotiation is to ask the authorities to understand our suffering and revoke the ban to allow us to continue raising pigs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a senior official of the Health Bureau stated that the authorities' ban on pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula was implemented after a long period of on-site research and careful consideration. No matter which aspect, it has been given attention. The facts over the years have shown that the pig farming that hinders sanitation in such a close proximity to the urban area must be eliminated in order to benefit the health of all residents. The authorities' policy focuses on the big picture and cannot be influenced by the dispensable things of a few people and affect the public. It is believed that the villagers of the Kowloon Peninsula can maintain their livelihoods by raising livestock such as chickens and ducks and planting vegetables without raising pigs. Therefore, for the sake of the health of more than one million residents, the authorities are determined to implement the ban strictly and are preparing all the steps to send staff from the Kowloon Peninsula Health Organization to various villages from Saturday and Sunday (the 17th) to investigate. Those who have not obtained a license and violate the order will be severely punished according to the law, and the police will assist in everything.</p>

<p>Shaoguan in Wartime Robes: Principal Chen Bingquan's Talk on Attending the Senate and Returning to Hong Kong - A Special Feature by Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>To what extent has the Guangdong Senate, which established the foundation of democratic politics in Guangdong Province, achieved? What kind of posture has the wartime capital of Guangdong Province, which is also the center of South China, adopted? ... These are the questions that patriotic overseas Chinese, especially those from Guangdong who are preparing to return to their hometown, are concerned about.</p>
<p>Chen Bingquan, the principal of Guangzhou University, is a current member of the Guangdong Senate. He went to Shaoguan earlier this month to attend the first Senate meeting and returned to Hong Kong a few days ago. The reporter specifically went to Guangzhou University to interview Principal Chen. The general impression of Shaoguan is probably like this:</p>
<p>The first Senate meeting of Guangdong Province opened on May 15 and successfully closed on the 28th, lasting for two weeks. In addition to the authorities reporting on the general situation of administration to facilitate consultations by the senators, the agenda also addressed the needs of the objective current situation and passed many proposals that should be implemented and reformed. The original text has been published in various newspapers in Hong Kong, so there is no need to repeat it here. Under the lessons of blood, the Guangdong authorities are now striving to govern, and it is believed that they will be able to accept public opinion and earnestly adopt the proposals. We hereby express our sincere hopes.</p>
<p>There are also two major events in the Senate itself that are worth praising. One is the senators' inspection of various regions; the other is sending personnel abroad to comfort overseas Chinese. In order to clarify officialdom, strengthen the power of resistance, and comfort overseas Chinese to encourage the rescue of the motherland, these, needless to say, are urgent tasks to be carried out. We also believe that the Senate will carry out this sacred task well.</p>
<p>A major event in terms of administration is that the Political Department of the Fourth War Zone held a cadre training group for party, government, and military personnel. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek served as the head of the group, and General Zhang Fakui served as the deputy head. Cadres from all levels in Guangdong, Guangxi, and southern Jiangxi were transferred to Shaoguan for training. Those receiving training in the "party" aspect were the secretaries-general of the party headquarters in each county; those in the "government" aspect were the county magistrates and section chiefs; those in the "military" aspect were officers above the rank of lieutenant; and those in the "education" aspect were the principals and training directors of secondary schools. They were drawn in three phases so that they could generally complete the training. Each phase lasted for two weeks and focused on spiritual training. The first phase has ended, and the second phase has begun. There are currently 740 people, with those in the "military" aspect accounting for more than 500. In the context of a shortage of cadres and the imperfect lower-level institutions, this should be a very meaningful event. Looking north, we are so excited!</p>
<p>Shaoguan, under the leadership of the wise and hardworking Generals Zhang Fa and others, is indeed wearing wartime robes. Principal Chen said with great interest: If there is an air raid by × aircraft, an alarm will be issued 30 minutes in advance. In addition to various sirens, a symbol like a "storm ball" is hung high - one for the first air raid alert and two for the emergency alert - and all the people disperse in a very orderly manner. In a moment, the whole city is empty, and there is no chaos. This is probably the best managed in the country.</p>
<p>Some of the residents of Shaoguan have dispersed to the suburbs, but they come back at night, so Shaoguan at night is very lively and prosperous. The rear area in wartime shows a stable and resolute state. The military and civilians are inspired by General Zhang Fakui's hard work from morning to night, and there is a reason for them to be ready to fight at any time.</p>
<p>Since June 1, the provincial government has implemented joint office work. However, this is to facilitate the unification of government orders. Outgoing official documents use the name of the provincial government instead of the name of the department. In fact, the departments are still scattered in various villages to make it difficult for × people's bombing.</p>
<p>The printing industry in the interior is very difficult. The newspapers in Shaoguan are mostly small. Printing business cards is not easy because transportation is inconvenient, and Hong Kong newspapers are rare in the interior. Only in Heyuan and Huiyang are they worth one cent per copy as usual.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the highway, transportation is very inconvenient. Principal Chen set off from Hong Kong on the 10th of last month, passing through Shantou, Chao'an, Huang, Xingning, Longzhou, Heping, Dingnan, Longnan Xinfeng, and Nanxiong in Jiangxi, taking a big circle and spending nine days to reach Qujiang. He started from Shaoguan on the 3rd of this month to return to Hong Kong, also passing through Nanxiong, Xinfeng, Longnan, Dingnan, Heping, and transferring to a boat to Longchuan, and then from Heyuan, Huiyang, Danshui, and Shayuchong, spending seven or eight days to arrive safely in Hong Kong. Senator Jin Zengcheng also accompanied Principal Chen. Speaker Wu Dingxin is still on official business in Shaoguan.</p>
<p>Today's Shaoguan is like Guangzhou in the era of the Eastern Expedition and the Northern Expedition. We must protect it, build it, and praise it so that it can exert its great power.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Event in the Hong Kong Drama Circle; United Performance by Drama Actors Staying in Hong Kong; "Before Dawn" to Be Performed at the Lee Theatre in the Middle of This Month; A Special Feature by Shi Liang</p>
<p>An Unprecedentedly Grand Event in the Hong Kong Drama Circle: United Performance by Drama Actors Staying in Hong Kong; "Before Dawn" to Be Performed at the Lee Theatre in the Middle of This Month</p>
<p>The Hong Kong drama movement has been making rapid progress in recent years, and the progress has been even more remarkable in recent months. The residence in Hong Kong of famous domestic drama groups and drama actors with extremely high reputations in the drama circle is undoubtedly an important factor in promoting the progress of the drama movement. Recently, in order to further unite themselves and at the same time plan to present the highest level of drama works at the current stage to the people of Hong Kong, the drama workers staying in Hong Kong decided to hold a joint grand performance. The date has been set for the 16th and 17th of this month, and the venue is the Lee Theatre. This is an unprecedentedly large-scale joint performance by drama actors. Those participating in this performance include the "China Traveling Drama Troupe," the "China Art Drama Troupe," and the "China National Salvation Drama Troupe." These drama troupes are all the best in the country and represent the peak of the drama movement at the current stage. This is something everyone knows.</p>
<p>This joint grand performance is also their first time working together so closely. Those participating in the performance, such as Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Yang Wei, Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Fan Zheng, Deng Zhujun, Tang Ruoying, Tong Yi, Zhang Lide, etc., are all outstanding drama actors with deep attainments in various groups. They have a long history of working hard in the drama movement, and in this large-scale joint performance, they are all playing unique roles and earnestly taking on their work.</p>
<p>In this joint grand performance, those responsible for stage design, lighting, costumes, props, effects, etc., are all people who regularly take on this kind of work in various groups. This time, they have gone through a considerable period of preparation, and the perfection and greatness are self-evident. Audiences who have seen their previous performances should remember that every time the curtain is raised, before the actors come on stage, the applause from the audience is already aroused by the magnificence of the scenery. This time, because it is a joint performance, this aspect will naturally be even more outstanding.</p>
<p>This performance, in terms of the scale, the selection of people, and everything else, is unprecedented. They are carrying out this performance work under an unprecedented unity. I think it will definitely cause a sensation throughout Hong Kong, and it will definitely let the audiences in Hong Kong know the form of the highest peak of the current drama movement, and it will definitely further lay the foundation for a new stage of drama.</p>
<p>It is heard that the play has been set as "Before Dawn." It includes four independent plays, all of which are the best works of the past twenty-two months. They have been performed countless times in the country and have won the love of thousands of audiences. What is described are all the touching stories before dawn, the prelude to dawn, and the thriving seedlings of the new culture! They are also representative works of playwrights.</p>
<p>The "China National Salvation Drama Troupe" has performed twice at the Lee Theatre since arriving in Hong Kong. Now, the troupe is about to go abroad, and this performance is probably the last performance. Who among those who have seen the troupe's performances would want to miss this opportunity?</p>
<p>Unprecedented unity, great performance, and the highest level of art will leave a new imprint on the history of drama and give the audience an unprecedented opportunity for appreciation. I can't help but be awakened by it!</p>

<p>Severe Rice Shortage in Various Counties; Chambers of Commerce of Various Counties in Hong Kong Rush to Provide Relief at Low Prices; Another Batch of Relief Rice Arrives in Town; Further Request to the Ministry of Finance to Increase the Amount of Tax-Exempt Rice</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of rice shortages in the counties of Dongxin, Kai, En, Tai, Zhongshan, and Shunde, the central government has approved the tax-free import of foreign rice, and the chambers of commerce of various counties in Hong Kong have raised funds to purchase rice and return to their hometowns to organize sales at low prices. Although the price of rice can be temporarily lowered, due to the large population of each county and the limitation of tax-free imports, it is not enough to distribute. Therefore, the severity of the rice shortage has not been reduced so far. In most areas of the four counties and Zhongshan, the price of rice is still expensive, and the people's livelihood is greatly affected. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, with the aim of providing relief to their hometowns, are still constantly working hard to raise funds to organize sales at low prices to provide relief.</p>
<p>A Batch of Relief Rice Arrives in Lan Town</p>
<p>Regarding Zhongshan, since the occurrence of the rice shortage in the county, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has raised funds to purchase rice and transport it back to various districts of the county to organize sales at low prices. Numerous batches have been shipped from Hong Kong, with a total of about 40,000 bags. However, the area of the county is vast and the population is large. This small number of tens of thousands of bags of rice is a drop in the bucket and does not help. Therefore, after the previously transported relief rice was sold out, the price of rice rose again. Recently, the fellows association of Lan Town in Hong Kong has again raised funds and assisted by the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce to purchase rice and return to their hometown for relief. This batch of relief rice, totaling more than 2,000 bags, was recently escorted by Chen Zhongchi, a member of the Zhongshan Relief Association, to Macau, from where it was transferred to Lan Town. The transportation and import procedures were carried out smoothly with the assistance of the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce and the county government.</p>
<p>Rice Shortage in the Interior Still Severe</p>
<p>Chen Zhongchi, the member who escorted the batch of relief rice, returned to Hong Kong from Zhongshan yesterday. He told reporters that after more than 2,000 bags of relief rice were transported back to Lan Town, they were handed over to the local Chongde Charity Hospital for sale at low prices. The method was still the same as the previous batches: the heads of various Baojia issued relief certificates, and then the residents of various neighborhoods purchased rice with the certificates. The rice shortage situation in Lan Town is still severe. Initially, the price of rice rose to only four to five Jin per yuan. After Hong Kong transported rice for relief, the price of rice returned to six to seven Jin per yuan. However, because the local population has greatly increased compared to before, the low-priced rice cannot be maintained for long. Once it is sold out, the price of rice will rise again. At the most expensive time, only three Jin were sold per yuan, and countless poor people went hungry due to the rice shortage. Since the recent batch of more than 2,000 bags of relief rice were transported back from Hong Kong, the poor in the county can get seven Jin per yuan, and their lives are slightly less difficult.</p>
<p>Organizing Congee to Relieve Hungry People</p>
<p>However, there are many compatriots in the countryside who have been greatly affected by the war and are suffering from the high price of rice. Countless people are unable to cook. Therefore, the local fellows association has launched a congee distribution campaign, which has already begun, and is soliciting donations from fellows in Hong Kong to provide relief to their hometowns. The original text of the donation solicitation is: Public announcement: Our town is now in the off-season, and the price of rice is soaring, with only three or four Jin sold per yuan, so that the poor cannot make ends meet. Our association, seeing this, has united with enthusiastic people in the town to launch low-priced sales, and rice has been transported back one after another, which is really a life-saving measure. However, our association feels that it cannot reach those who are unable to buy rice. Therefore, based on the principle of doing good with others, we will again organize congee distribution to provide relief. We hope that kind gentlemen will show their compassion and contribute generously, no matter how much or little, so that the general public who are unable to buy rice can relieve their hunger and thirst. Our association has high hopes for this."</p>
<p>Requesting the Ministry of Finance to Increase the Tax-</p>
<h3>Women's Class in the Mountains</h3>
<p>— Bai Cuizhen</p>
<p>(News from Shengxi) In Shengxi, nestled within these mountains, the emergence of a people's literacy class is, I dare say, an unprecedented event. This literacy class has been running for over two months. To avoid interfering with their work hours, two literacy classes were established: a daytime class from 1 PM to 3 PM, exclusively for women, and a nighttime class from 7 PM to 9 PM, exclusively for men. Twenty-six men registered for the men's class. However, due to their work as stonemasons, sand collectors, and traders, and sometimes being in mines or traveling to distant markets, they cannot always return in time. Consequently, each class typically has around [number missing] students. The subjects taught include Mandarin, general knowledge, arithmetic, current events, and singing. Now, I want to focus specifically on the situation of the women's class.</p>
<p>In the women's class, seven members attend every day. The oldest is thirty years old, and the youngest is only sixteen. Two of them bring their children to class every day. A discussion forum is held once a week, with the following topics: (1) how to raise children, (2) what women should do in the people's liberation movement, (3) who are the Japanese invading China, (4) why Chinese women suffer so much, (5) why Soviet women live so comfortably, and (6) how can we find a path to happiness. Naturally, these questions are discussed in a way that appeals to them. I remember during the first discussion forum, none of them were willing to speak. I tried my best to encourage them to talk and started by saying, "Today, let's just chat casually. How about everyone sharing about their family life? Let's start with Bai Cuizhen." They secretly pushed each other, but no one wanted to speak.</p>
<p>In this situation, I could only talk about matters that were most relevant to them. I started by asking, "Whose husband has the best temper?" They all laughed and blushed simultaneously, seemingly embarrassed. I had to continue, "I know your husbands must treat you very well, unlike the terrible customs elsewhere, where men oppress women to death. Many men smoke, drink, gamble, and completely ignore their family responsibilities. The wives can only endure everything. If their wives tell them not to do those improper things, they'll be beaten." Yang Chunxi, who was sitting across from me, said with resentment, "Hmph, isn't mine like that? Fortunately, the government sent him to repair roads. If he were home, I wouldn't have a single happy day, let alone think about studying! It makes me furious! He doesn't have a roof over his head or anything solid under his feet. My own food and clothing come from helping people sew and wash clothes and collecting cinnabar. Yet, he still constantly asks me for money to smoke and gamble! If I don't give it to him, I get beaten. I just hope he dies out there and doesn't come back! I'm much happier at home alone, studying and helping people with work." Liu [character missing]zhen, seeing Chunxi's intensity, voluntarily began to share her hardships: "You, and me too! Haven't you all seen it with your own eyes? That good-for-nothing often beats me until my hands are swollen and my face is bruised, and he tells me to get out, saying he bought me with his mother's head, and he doesn't want me. I not only have to endure his beatings and scolding, but I also have to put up with my in-laws and my husband's younger sister. Fortunately, that good-for-nothing was sent to repair roads, and Mr. Cha talked to my mother-in-law and insisted that I come to study. Otherwise, I would only be able to study in my next life. I would never have imagined studying in this life. My suffering is truly endless." She started to cry. Tian Laocui said, "Don't cry. People like us can only blame our bad fate. We didn't cultivate virtue in our previous life. My husband is busy all day with his opium addiction. I use the little money I save from washing clothes to set up a stall and do some small business to support me and my child. A husband like that is better than having no husband at all." Yang Linzhi: "Crying is useless. There's only one solution: fight him! If you can't beat him, we'll unite and help each other! Or drag him to the government and sue him. My husband used to beat me for any little thing, grabbing my hair and hitting me. One time he beat me so badly that I couldn't take it anymore. I desperately dragged him to the government, and he was given dozens of blows to the buttocks. After that, he never dared to hit me so easily again." (Everyone applauded.)</p>
<p>Finally, I said, "That's right! We shouldn't think that women should be abused by men. We need to be stronger. Women's abilities are no less than men's. Many female soldiers on the front lines are fighting alongside men ××××——Women today cannot be as weak as women in the past, submitting to men in everything. This era is a new era. Women of the new era must fight for all their freedom and equality. We shouldn't say that we have bad luck. Happiness is created by ourselves. However, in China currently oppressed by Japanese imperialism, we can only help in the war of resistance to achieve freedom and liberation. How can we help the war of resistance? Of course, it would be even better to go to the front lines. If we can't go to the front, we can do production work in the rear to support the war effort. Sewing clothes and shoes for the soldiers on the front lines, helping the soldiers on the front lines care for their children and take care of their elderly parents, comforting wounded soldiers, serving wounded soldiers, and so on. Not only should we do this ourselves, but we should also mobilize the people in the countryside to do the same. Because only by uniting the people can we drive out Japanese imperialism. Only after Japanese imperialism is driven out can a new country be realized. Only then will we have good days."</p>
<p>Their progress is rapid. Initially, they were women who didn't know a single character, were well-behaved, and didn't speak. But after two months of studying, they are completely different. Now they can give speeches on stage, participate in singing, and do propaganda work during market days. They can keep diaries. Now, excerpts from their diaries are written below.</p>
<p>Today is Monday. After Mandarin class, we had a memorial week. Mr. Cha told us that Wuhan has been captured, and our area is also in danger. If they come, we will join the guerrilla force because I heard Mr. Cha say that the guerrilla force is organized by the people, with both men and women, and they are very powerful. I also heard Mr. Cao say one day that there is an old woman named Zhao in Northeast China, her hair is all white, and she is still a leader in the guerrilla force! I hope we can organize a guerrilla force here soon. We must all work together with one heart and unite firmly, so that ××××× none of them are left in China. If the country is lost, men will not have good days, and women will have even worse days! (Yang Chunxi, November 23)</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to school to study. Mr. Cha told us that ×××× has been defeated by China. Now our compatriots should work harder and intensify their efforts to defeat Japanese imperialism! (Yang Linzhi, November 23)</p>
<p>Today I heard Mr. Xiao doing propaganda on the street, saying that the Japanese devils are insulting our Chinese women, killing many of our compatriots, seizing our land, and bombing Changde. When I heard this, I was really angry! (Liu [character missing]zhen, November 25)</p>
<p>One day I heard that Mr. Cha was leaving, and I couldn't concentrate on studying. The next day, I heard that it was uncertain, and I was very happy! Since he came here, we have learned about many countries. Now our knowledge is also improving day by day. I hope all our classmates will strive forward and walk on that path to happiness! (Bai Cuizhen, October 3)</p>
<p>Today we had another meeting to discuss what women should do during this war of resistance. Later, Mr. Cha also proposed that we participate in the propaganda work done by the men's school every time we go to the market. We all agreed, but I agreed with my mouth, but I was very scared in my heart, because I didn't know what to say during the propaganda. Later, Mr. Cha said that two days before each market day, we will discuss the propaganda materials, and everyone will take turns giving speeches and decide who will give the speech. The day before going to the market, when we go to class, we will practice speaking, and Mr. Cha will supplement anything that is incorrect. After I knew these situations, I was not afraid anymore, and I was very happy in my heart, because the people in our area look down on women. If we can go to the streets to give speeches and let them see it, they will know that we women are also useful!</p>
<h3>The Problem of Women's Liberation in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Mr. Chen Yiyun, a member of the Women's Movement Committee of the Central Social Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, the leader of the Battlefield Service Group of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement Headquarters, and the editor-in-chief of the Women's Resonance Monthly, is a respected leader in the women's community.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Chen came to Guilin from Qiyang, Hunan, with two missions. The first was to arrange for printing matters and prepare to move the "Women's Resonance" magazine to Guilin for publication. This is welcome news, as Guilin, as the heart of southwestern China, desperately needs a publication to guide women's work. The second was to purchase a large batch of medicines and hope that all sectors of society can do their best to donate to him, because since the fall of Nanchang, Hengyang, which has suffered a major bombing, has been unable to obtain medicines, and the suffering villagers are in dire need of medical supplies.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, Mr. Chen has traveled around, enthusiastically leading women in rescue work. Half a year ago, she was commissioned by Madame Chiang to serve as the captain of the Women's Battlefield Service Team, leading more than a hundred female comrades to do rural mobilization work in various counties of Hunan. After working for half a year, passing through more than ten counties, she gained a lot of valuable work experience. The team is still working in the Hengshan area.</p>
<p>During this busy schedule, she took the time to come to Guilin for only a few days' stay and will soon return to Qiyang. During these few days, she talked with Guangxi women leaders Madame Li, Madame Bai, Madame Huang, and women's work cadres. Mr. Chen expressed his deep admiration for the soundness of Guangxi's political organization and various implementations, and talked about how Guangxi's women's movement should expand to the countryside in the future, so that educated women can better play their leading role and complete the broad mobilization of Guangxi women.</p>
<p>A few days ago, all the female staff members of the Guangxi Provincial Government gathered in the auditorium of the Provincial Government to listen to Mr. Chen's speech on the problem of women's liberation in the War of Resistance, recounting the past and present of the Chinese women's movement. After more than twenty years of struggle, the reason why the Chinese women's movement has not made much progress is that now, in the political departments of the front-line troops, there are still very few female political workers, and there are still heartbreaking phenomena such as women living a hellish life in the middle. These are all because women have superficially obtained equal rights with men in politics and economics, but in fact, due to the poverty of women's political awareness and various knowledge abilities, they have given up many rights and delayed the struggle for their own liberation. Therefore, if women want to obtain various political and economic rights after the victory of the War of Resistance, they must strengthen their political and various cultivation in the War of Resistance and strengthen the work of the War of Resistance. Finally, she said that there are more than seventy female staff members in the Guangxi Provincial Government. This good phenomenon is not available in other provinces. The arduous struggle of Guangxi women has always been praised. But I hope to work harder, especially the backbone of women in the provincial government who are in a leading position, should use their position and ability to mobilize and organize rural women and working women. An organized and powerful women's mass is the cornerstone of women's liberation and the victory of the War of Resistance. (Hao)</p>

<h3>The Situation in the Tianjin Concession is Precarious British Prepare to Cope with Contingencies The Japanese Attitude Toward Britain is Still Extremely Tough China Insists on Opposing Compromise</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 13th] As the Japanese threaten to blockade the Tianjin concession, the British do not feel nervous but express their determination to cope with contingencies. However, the current situation here is already very serious. The British authorities have taken preventive measures. The Doughty Light Infantry patrols the border of the concession at any time. The Japanese commander here issued a public announcement today, stating that from 6 AM tomorrow morning, traffic between the British and French concessions and the Japanese area will be suspended. All pedestrians and vehicles will not be allowed to pass. The international bridge will be closed from 6 AM to midnight. Pedestrians and vehicles must be interrogated and inspected by the Japanese side. The announcement condemns the British authorities for (1) protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements, (2) supporting the legal tender and hindering the circulation of the puppet Federal Reserve Bank currency, (3) promoting high prices, (4) condoning unregistered radios, and (5) allowing schools in the concession to use anti-Japanese textbooks. The announcement concludes that the above measures taken by the Japanese side will not be revoked until the British authorities completely change their attitude and cooperate with Japan to recognize the new situation in North China and jointly build a new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Tianjin News, the [Japanese] military and consulate authorities held an emergency meeting at midnight on the 10th. Takeuchi, the economic section chief of the Asia Development Board, came to Tianjin from Beijing to participate in the meeting. It did not end until the morning of the 11th. Decisions were made on financial countermeasures after the blockade of the concession. A spokesperson for the [Japanese] military and the Japanese consul announced on the 12th that the blockade of the concession would begin from that day or the 13th. Foreign commercial organizations with warehouses in the urban area were required to move their inventory into the concession by the 12th, otherwise, the Japanese side would not be responsible for any consequences. The American consul in Tianjin has also been notified that all 450 Americans in Tianjin will still be allowed to import a considerable amount of food after the blockade, and their supplies may even be provided by the Japanese side. This move by the Japanese side is solely to deal with Britain and France. It is also said that special passes will be issued to foreign journalists. It is reported that after learning of the above news, the British Consul-General told foreign reporters that if the Japanese side [words missing, probably 'maintains the blockade'] for more than seven weeks, the British side will take necessary measures to cope with it. Furthermore, there have been no diplomatic negotiations between the [Japanese] side and the British and French concessions since the 12th. News from Tokyo also confirmed that the blockade would take place on the 14th, so mediation efforts have been halted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] This morning, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee meeting was held at No. 10 Downing Street, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain. The serious situation recently occurring in Tianjin was also among the topics discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] According to Reuters sources, the British government has suggested to Japan the organization of a "three-person committee," with two members, one British and one Japanese, and a chairman who would be a citizen of a third country. The mission of the committee is to determine whether the Chinese that the Japanese are demanding to extradite from Tianjin have indeed committed criminal acts and whether there is a need for extradition.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government sent a note to the British Embassy in Chongqing, protesting the transfer of so-called "terrorists" to the Japanese side by the British authorities in the Tianjin British concession. According to the contents of the note, the only authority with the right to decide on extradition is the Chinese government. The British authorities in the Tianjin British concession should not interfere, and the Japanese side has no right to intervene. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has also instructed its ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, to lodge a similar protest with the British Foreign Office.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Japanese military's blockade of Tianjin has attracted great attention here. At the same time, there have been threats made against the British ambassador. Most newspapers have reported the events of the two incidents with large headlines. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that the Tianjin incident "is the most difficult crisis for Britain since the Sino-Japanese War." Over the past weekend, telegrams were exchanged frequently between the British Foreign Office, the British Ambassador to China, and the Consul-General in Tianjin. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, is also assisting in every way, hoping to obtain a compromise solution. However, the Japanese are still insisting on achieving their desired goals and are unwilling to make any concessions. Powerful figures in London are now urging the government to take decisive action to protect British interests in China. Sir Erle Drax, a member of the British House of Lords, has demanded a ban on Japanese ships entering Piraeus and Singapore. Similar demands will be made at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow, a number of powerful representatives will visit Foreign Secretary Butler, specifically requesting the government to create a consular visa system for goods transported to China and to strengthen the defenses of Shanghai. In recent months, British public opinion has become increasingly tough. Even newspapers that have previously expressed friendliness towards the Japanese have changed their attitude. The British government spokesman often replies to questions from members of Parliament in the House of Commons, saying, "This matter has been raised with Tokyo." Now, this is only enough to provoke the ridicule of the members. Everyone feels that the Japanese military's infringement of British interests is becoming increasingly serious, unless Britain can frankly indicate that it is prepared to retaliate.</p>

As a result, they captured five puppet police and six puppet soldiers, as well as six rifles and countless military supplies. They safely returned to their original defense at 1 AM on the 8th. In this battle, only one of our brave soldiers was slightly injured.</p>
