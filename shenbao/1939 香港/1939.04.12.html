<p>社評</p>
<h3>加緊華僑婦女動員工作</h3>
<p>目前抗戰建國大業，正值非常嚴重的階段，國家之是否能够獲得平等獨立民族之是否能够獲得解放幸福，完全要看我們目前抗戰之是否能够獲得全民族生動力量的堅強支持而定。而全民族生動力量總動員的是否能够切實成功，第一重要的問題就是全國婦女動員之是否成功。海外華僑婦女，何祇千萬！如果我，能够動員全體海外華僑婦女參加××建國工作，則其意義的重大，是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>抗戰二十餘月以來，各地華僑婦女的覺悟份子，曾經先後爲××建國工作而服務，如自動囘國參加戰地服務，如鼓勵男性僑胞躍上前線，如努力收容並保育兒童，如動員組織和教育難民，徵慕慰勞前線將士及故鄕難民捐欵，如踴躍的參加義賣獻金連動等，都曾建樹相當偉大的功績，爲華僑婦女增加不少光榮。此在本港婦女界方面，由於婦女先進的領導和努力，成績之大，尤爲可敬。最近廣州女靑年會遷港辦事，現又組織婦女囘國服務團，其爲國家民族而犧牲而服務的精神，眞是令人感激萬分的。我國華僑婦女這種爲國家民族而犧牲而服務而鬥爭的精神與行動，不僅對于抗戰建事業，盡了極大的助力，確立未來勝利與成功的基礎，同時對于婦女本身向解放運動，亦可開闢光明坦蕩的前途，大大地提高了婦女本身的政治地位和逐漸實現其實際生活的改善。</p>
<p>不過我們同時要認清另一事實，即過去二十餘月華僑婦女的××建國服務，其範圍非常狹小，其效力非常微弱，而尤其嚴重的現象，是能够認清而且努力參加服務的，還祇限於少數先進的覺悟的知識婦女和極少數的女工，廣大的各界婦女和家庭婦女，還繼續未被動員起來參加抗戰建國一切工作，更談不到如何提高她們的自動性與積極性織織，而華僑婦女運動幹部人才的缺乏，尤爲最重要的原因。往往因爲缺少這種幹部人才，使已組織起來的婦女，不能認眞切實地供献她們爲國家民族服務的心力，不能鞏固及發展婦女大衆團結起來的力量，至於廣大婦女力量之遺棄於××建國事業之外，而消耗於無請工作及空閉之中的，其情形更爲不堪想象。</p>
<p>因此，栽們今日加緊華僑婦女動員工作的中心任務，就要訓練大批婦女軍動的幹部人材。第步，我們要廣泛地無私地吸收華僑婦女中，忠實於××建國事業，具有救亡工作經騐，並爲羣衆所信賴的份芋，我們要從各地域各階層各黨派各職業中去吸收及選擇這些份子。第二步，我們要就她們的性情和興趣，建立各種各樣的訓練組織，我們要加緊組織戰地服務團，傷乒難民救護隊出征將士家屬慰問隊等，我們要同祖國或到前綫去服務；就首先要訓練熟嫻這種工作的人材；我們要如緊組織後方宣傳隊，動員促進會，兒童保育會，擴大慕捐運動，救傷防毒，××××××，屬行節約及擴大生產運動等，也就首先要訓練大批適宜於領導這種工作的榦部人材。此外，在培養一切華僑婦女動員工作的幹部之時，以及爲擴大華僑婦女動員工作而宣傳組織及敎育廣大的婦女之時，首先應當使她們獲得一切有關××的基本知識提高她們的政治認識，提高她們的自尊心和自信心；使對於統一戰綫持久××最後勝利具有充分的認識；其次還要不斷的研究婦女運動尤其是婦女動員組織教育工作的經驗與敎訓，不斷地參加一切實際的婦女運動，從理論與實踐相配合的過程中壯大與聯合起來。</p>
<p>華僑婦女如果能够一致動員起來，對於××建國大業，對於民族解放運動，一定要發生偉大的助力；同時對於婦女解放運動，更將顯出非常重大的推進力量。特別是在這××建國的嚴重階段，加緊華僑婦女動員工作，已經成爲當前華僑婦女運動的中心任務。我門祈望各界華僑婦女認淸自身在目前階段重要的地位和任務，自動地積極地起來努力，我們更祈望政府和各界人士立卽用一切適宜的方式，予以切實有力的帮助。</p>
<h3>晉東南的青年救國會</h3>
<p>【長治通訊】晉東南第五行政區靑年救國會，於二月三日正式成立，到會五區各界代表，除浮山外，共八十餘人，代表四萬餘會員，包含不同階層，信仰，職業，性別，靑年，精神團結，濟濟一堂。</p>
<p>開會時，首先由籌委會報吿籌備經過，幷對當地軍政畏官，犧牲同盟，公道團，以及各救亡團體的領導與帮助，深致謝意，其次正式通過閻衛司令長官，朱彭總副司令，馮戎二專員，囘民領袖馬君國等十四人爲大會名譽主席團，繼由主席團代表石民先生致開會詞，對目前政治環境和大會的任務——檢討過去，計劃將來，作了一個簡明的的報，同時又提出了保證完成任務的條件，（一）靑年的光榮傳統與寶貴經驗，（二）五區靑年一年來的工作經驗與敎訓，（三）各軍政長官救亡先進的領導，（四）到會代表的努力，來賓當中，五區專當代表趙科長，首先登台發言，詳述他對人會的感想，對靑年的熱心努力救亡工作，頗多贊同，繼復勉勵到會代表，認淸環境，認淸靑年的重大責任，繼續發揚靑年的光榮傳統，中國抗戰利益與靑年大衆本身的利益，是不可分離的，靑年要爲抗戰建國事業而奮鬥到底，幷且又說到學員與工作同樣也是不可分　離的，應該在工作中來武裝靑年們的頭腦和身體，應當澈底克服靑年人的不虛心，不耐心，容易消極灰心的一些弱點。最後，他希望靑年能够號召廣大靑年羣衆參加抗戰。</p>
<p>接着决死隊第×縱隊兼×區保安司令×司令講話，大意希望到會代表：第一，要担負起相等團結所有晉東南靑年的任務；第二，領導並敎育廣大靑年；第三，動員靑年參戰；弟四，希望大會通過完善綱領，並逐見於實行。犧公上黨中心區駐長治辦事處代表魏克明先生希望大會，討論出靑年工作綫，培養，加强靑年力量。晉東南總工救代表楊珏同志，動員工友，靑年與工人團結起來。×路軍工作團代表黄遠同志，提出靑年的團結統一學習等問題。婦救籌委會楊同志，希望靑救能够帮助婦女工作。此外，救導團隊第三團，三區靑救，五區農救，五區工救，太行山文化敎育出版社，太行山藝術學校，靑年記者學會太行山分會等，十數團體代表，均有發言，對於改善靑年生活，靑年文化敎育，團結各黨派靑年建立靑年統一戰綫問題，均有詳細闡明。</p>
<p>最後，晉東南靑救總會籌委會代表，發表意見，希望切實討論靑年工作和學名問題，怎樣能充實肯救工作，並向大會建議：第一，有組織有計劃的動員靑年參戰，第二，動員擴大靑年參加各種訓練班（軍，政，文化等），第三笨固並擴大靑救組織。</p>
<p>各代表來賓演講過後，大會又通過，發言成立之宣言，吿全區靑年書，吿全區父老書。並電蔣委員長，閻衞司令長官，朱彭總副司令，譚戎二專員等致敬，直至下午四時，朗讀各方致大會賀電後，始圓滿的宣吿休會。</p>
<h3>艱苦學習的一個月　中國青年記者學會南方辦事處主辦　桂林戰時新聞工作講習班的生活</h3>
<p>— 樊康</p>
<p>每天當省政府門排排列起號兵準備降旗的時候，我們——戰新班的同學總得經過這里，趕着上課去。對國旗行了注目敬禮，懷着一種跑滿的愉快的心情，出王成經過一段滿注着雨水泥瀾的中華街。（整日的淫雨壓不倒令學學習的摯心）抵達那間中心小學內的破舊的大課堂——然而年靑人的活躍把她宣染得滿有生氣的了。</p>
<p>秋江先生吊起身子忙於給掛着的汽燈打氣，那完全外行的生硬的動作，使人發笑。這是開課第一天。——一月一日降詒先生趕着講完這堂「採訪講話」，當晚就嬰動身到重慶去。頭上幾天長江先生扶病來上課，他說起他以前初當記者學習無門之苦，而我們——現在實在是够幸福的了。</p>
<p>這次講習班原定只招收六十名，但投考的竟有二百多，于是擴充的招收一百名。但是却還有九位落取的要求一旁聽」，班方爲着課堂小，無法答應。然而那些可敬佩的朋友便站在門外聽課，終于他們被容納了。</p>
<p>開課的第三天，一個盛大的「師生交誼會」舉行了。自我介紹，大家嘻嘻哈哈，但心里却在肅然起敬。有一位小學敎員從二三，里外的鄕下跑來聽課，有在外地報館服務的一位，特地爲此請假一月，還有位是英勇的「八百壯士」之一…</p>
<p>我們的學校應該澈底實行師生合作。在交誼會上，我們通過了班方的建議：推定全學參加班的工作會議，並且跟據了同學在會前交予班方的許多寶貴意見，决定一行小組生活，决定課外工作：工作實習隊，圖書參考室，座談會等</p>
<p>工作實習隊出版自由報，由各組輪流編緝。每天上午九時許中央社的電稱一到，這間編輯室兼印刷—場的小房間，便活動起來了。仝學們像煞有介事地開始工作，總編輯把電稿粗看一道，分類交予各欄編輯，自己編要聞，寫社評，各欄編輯也忙着刪短電文，標「標題」。大家撅着嘴熟練地運用着紅墨水，剪子，漿糊…「我們要爭取二點鎮出版」。「打破第×組的記錄」。憑着這些話大家的精神更振奮起來，雖然這時肚子已經在作不平之鳴。有一位丢開紅水筆忙着找鋼筆報開始爲臘紙了。就這樣，我們這班編緝先生便先後改行，變作印刷工人了。「我們的捲簡機每小時印多少？」「一百萬份。「當心，臘紙破了。」「快加上紗布呀」「糟糕，還只印了四十份。」…一直到晚間做完了報販工作，仝學們和先進仝志給自由報的稱許或嚴格的批評，使工作者一天的辛勞得到最大的代價了。</p>
<p>第一次座談會是歡送夏衍先生和長江先生。度衍先生述說他在中學時代因爲辦刊物竟遭開除甚至不得不逃到上海的畢件。長江先生說，「讓自由報像自由之花開遍在我們偏僻的鄕村，在敵人的後方吧，」是的，我們有優良的學者環境，應該開拓出更偉大的串業來呀！</p>
<p>我們艱苦的學習生活就在這樣共同感應下，像一股頑張的溪水激流着，有一次，在講課完畢後的集體討論中一個學補充了長江先生講的「新階段的新聞工作」的一個特點，即就是，從單純的宣傳敎育到組織的功用，被欣然的接受了。在課外仝學們冒着風雨，熬着長夜去參觀各報館的印刷部和編輯部，令學們由此認識了新聞工作的艱苦性，和先進仝志對于我們期望的殺勤。</p>
<p>日子過得飛快，一個月時間也眞太短了，爲着聯絡感情並繼續學習，仝事會的組織被提出而終千很快的組織起來了。</p>
<p>三月一日上了「最後一課」，大家正是有些依依惜別的時俟，陳農非先生提出了「舉行一次檢討會」的建議，馬上得到仝學們的擁護。第二天。檢討會上我們檢討了一月來學習生活，熱烈地指出許多缺點來如小組生活不够健全等。我們不怕有缺點，我們要在改正缺點克服錯誤中前進。我們是年靑的一羣呀</p>
<p>四日的畢業典禮，到了許多文化人和黨政機關的官長給我們訓話，那一片融洽的空氣，是難忘的印象。主席鍾期森先生說，這次講名班的開辦首先得感謝廣西當局給予的幫助和許多講師能忙中抽出時間來授課。這裏尤其使我們仝畢敬佩的是革命老前輩李任仁先生他以六十歲的高齡來給我們授「中山遺教」一課。那天。他還來給我們殷殷訓話，照我們爲攻心的戰士，希望我們在政治重于軍事的第二埸抗戰中加緊努力！</p>
<p>是的，我們應該担起這些攻心的戰士」的職責來。但對于我們忠勇的以血肉來抵抗强×的攻城的戰士，我們更是一刻也不能忘懷，由仝學會的建議，每個仝學繳納文憑費大洋五毫捐與「傷兵之友社」。</p>
<p>最後，那是如何令人興奮的消息。講習班中部份同學組成了一個戰塲新聞工作團。打算深入內地去採訪，去展開新聞工作，這無疑是短短爲期僅一個月的講習班的一個偉人收獲。</p>
<p>發揚我們一月來艱苦學習的精神，同學們，前面是更艱苦的路程呀！</p>
<h3>湘桂路上的衡陽　（下）　中國之友在中國（五）</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>李蒙本來是愛說話而能說話的。精一先生的問題正像是打開話匣子的鎖鑰繼續下去，就唱个不休了，李蒙說：</p>
<p>我在中國的三个月中，中國朋友們問我的第一个問題都是關於法國的遠東外交政策，而尤其是注重在法國對於中國的態度。當然這决不是個普通隨隨便使的發問，而是個充滿了友誼，希望和關切的熱情的表露。同時，我相信，中國人對於法國外交態度的特別注意，也决不是單純地因爲法國的女南與中國地點上有着密切的聯繫。而是因爲法國至今尙存着自由獨立祖國，和國際心理，民主制度的保姆，的美名。所以雖然法國到現在爲止，還沒有洽中國以很大的幚助，可是這種堅决的信任却始終深切地仔留在每一个中國人的腦海裏。故站在「中國之友」的立場以一个還有着爲自由，獨立而鬥爭的光榮傳統的法國人資格，該有着正在爲自由，獨立，世界和平，以及國際正義而奮鬥着的朋友們說明一下法國遠東外交政策的必要。第一講到法國的外交政策必然要和近幾年來的國際局勢聯帶起來。從希特勒於1033年爬上了德國的政治舞合少後，歐洲便走進他們不幸的境遇了，而這種不幸的成份還是逐漸增進的。建立日耳曼帝國的野心給了德國附近的國家以不斷的威脅，特别是對德國交界的法國，以及中歐許多和法國有良好友誼的小國。德意軸心成立以來，法西斯勢力的蓬拔更增加了歐洲的無限危機。歐洲民主國家對於法西斯勢力威脅的第一个反應乃是想於1034年與侵略者成立妥協的四强協定，由於法西斯國家的野心太大要求過高，所謂四强協定遂吿流產。舉例來說，德國要旨在中東歐的自由活動，意大利在地中海與北菲有特別的勢力範圍。這種歷史上的事實說明了法國是怎樣在忙於應付中歐和北菲的糾紛。並且薩爾事件，阿比西尼亞的被吞併，曼耳奧地利，捷克斯拉夫，以及都尼斯，哥斯里等，這一連串悲慘的史蹟更證明了法國是怎樣地無能爲力。</p>
<p>當中日戰爭開始的時候，歐洲的危機亦隨之空前地增漲着；法西斯勢力進攻西班牙格外凶猛了，納粹黨奪取捷克斯拉夫也就毫不猶豫地開始。所以，我們可以注意到，中日戰爭的發展和歐洲危機的加深是同時並進的。在1938年年底，法國須要集中精力專注於與德國，意大利，西班牙等處交界的邊境上。這正說明了法國的注意力是在歐洲。同時法，國雖然明白地知道中日戰正中的罪魁日本帝國主義是德意法西斯的同盟者，而中日戰期的延長正給了安南的安全以莫大的威脅。然而，法蘭西在歐洲旣是自顧不暇，對於安南國防力量的增强，也就無法幫忙了。這是事實，安南政府與人民一致地了解，如果日本萬一眞能戰勝中國，那末，安南的命運也就十分危急了。這是爲什麽安南人一致地同情中國的抗戰和恢復了叫中國人爲中國叔叔（Chinese　Unele）這稱呼的理由。這也是事實，直到1938年年底，安南才得到一點法國對於增加安南國防力量的幫助。以上的許多事實，吿訴我們爲什麽法國至今還沒有給中國以更多的協助。</p>
<p>除了歐州局勢過於緊張而使法國無暇他顧的這種實際的理由之外，此地還存在着一些其他政治上的原因。從法國人民陣綫政府消解了之後，法國內部的法西斯勢力亦在不斷地强化。我們知道，在同一个國家裏的法西斯組織或同情法西斯的保守的黨派都是傾向於日本的。因此日本就利用法國法西斯力量的幫助，以大量的金錢在巴黎設立嚴密的宣傳機關，以麻醉法國的輿論。進一步說，法國的政界人物，以往還受了中國某有名望的政治家的（指汪衛精）許多言論的影響，他屢次地說：「中國是个弱國，沒有機戒化和科學化的部隊，中國是無法可以抵抗的……故中國最好的出路上過於與日本講和，」這種情形，引起法國政治圈內的人物有了這樣一个普遍的感想；如果中國本身旣無對於抗戰必勝的信心，我們幫助中國自然也是个無意義的事體了，况國際局勢又是這樣惡劣，法國能給中國幫助亦甚有限。同時，如果中國的情形眞像這位政治家所說，那末法國這一點點幫助亦是不足以增加其勝利的可能的。在另一方面，這點對於中國的微小的助力倒反適足以招至日本人的仇恨。這例子多少也可說明了法國對中國所採的態度。</p>
<p>不過，我還得報吿一般的實際情形，的確法國的大部份輿論，始終還是站在中國方面的，詳細點說，所有前進的，左翼的政黨和民衆團體都是完全堅决地贊助中國的，當然，他們若能得到更多的關系中國英勇抗戰的事實導報的話，那末這種單純發之於正義感的同情心，必然有進一步的發展，其影嚮亦會因之而擴大和加强。另外一樁事，我們也是須要知道的，日本人在法國的宣傳組織非常健全，日本人是全世界上最有走私技巧的國家。現在他們已把各種走私的技術應用到宣傳工作上來了；一方面他宣泄着中國是怎樣的野蠻，他方面却拚命鼔吹日本是怎樣在爲中日的友善而戰。但是我們非常了解，這種種都不過是亳無事實根據的自欺欺人的把戲而已，法國人大部份知道日本宣傳工作不過是想掩飾其在中國的屠殺平民和轟炸不設防城市，鄕村，的罪惡就是了，同時我們也知道日本人口中的所謂「親善」不過是讓日本爲中國的「唯一之友」換句話講，「遠東是遠東人的遠東。而日本則是遠東的唯一主人」。但是中國即也有着最好的官傳辦」，這就是十九个月來不折不扣英勇抗戰的事實。决不帶絲毫誇張地講，在畏期抗戰中，中國已取得了國防上極良好的外交地位了。我們可以信深。隨着中日戰爭的發展，各民主國家裏大多數同情中國的輿論，將會推動各國政府對於遠東的外交政策採取一種更積極的態度。法國自然也不可例外地要有一種新的轉機。</p>
<p>另外還有个理由也可以說明法國遠東政策轉變的可以能性。這就是法國的政府現在己不能不了解日本在遠東的行動，絕對不足以征服中國，而却正够破壞遠東外人的利益。在經濟上講，法國政府目然會感到日本已開始侵略安南了，以往日本對付華北的所謂「經濟提携」現在已開始在安南進行了。所謂與日本在遠東保持友善的企圖實在無異是個夢想。而安南政府要求法國設法淸除境內日本間諜的提議，也已不袛一次了。本來，法國政府以爲與日本保持友好是保障安南安全的最好策略，但是，事實吿訴我們，當捷克事件非常惡化，全世界人士正等待着第二次世界大戰，降臨的時候。九隻日本軍艦一開始戈游於圍洲島與巴拉西爾斯島（Paracels　Iland）之事而將接近安南的海防綫了—毫無懷疑的，若歐洲的砲火果眞爆發；日本立刻便會在安南登陸。我相信，這兩事實的敎調，當會使法國政府覺悟，保障安南和維護九國公約的唯一辦法，袛有幫助中國抗戰，打倒共同的敵人法西斯日×！</p>
<p>繼李蒙這長篇的談話之後，精一先生和其他政治部裏的朋友們都提出了許多怎樣才能深切了解中國實際情形的意見，以供李蒙借用。而××師的副師長張夏威先生，還表示了一些對於外國友人的希望，和怎樣竭力促進中法兩國進步結合的意見。</p>
<p>這一場充滿着國際友誼的歡宴，和有點像日內瓦大會場外咖啡室裏的談話，遂吿結束。其實，時間也的確不早了，已將近十點鐘，明晨我們還不得不淸早趕路呢！</p>
<p>從巴塞龍那失守，和日本在海南島登陸之後，法國更陷於四面楚歌的境地。法西斯侵略者的野心是沒有止境的；日本要「建立東亞新秩序」。意大利要滿足他的一天然的願望」，希特拉則提出「武裝分配全球之天然財富」的恫嚇。如果說這種得寸進尺的野心是可以用退讓的辦法而求得德意的適可而止的話，那末，慕尼黑會議將司以解决一切問題了。然而，事實吿訴我們完全不是那末一會事，在一月三十日的國會演說中，希特拉一方面主張重分世界領土資源，同時又公開表示贊助意大利的侵略行動。希特勒一演說已在慕尼黑會議後的所謂英德宣言和法德不再戰争宣言的價値大大地降低了。英法以往可以慷他人之慨把第三者的利益拿來犧牲，現在此地已沒有奧地利，捷克，阿日西尼亞……等再可以供英法當作飼狼之鷄的第三者了。德意重分世界領土資源的企圖已和英法起着直接的激烈的鬥爭。並且問題還不局限於地中海，西默，北菲……而已普及到太平洋，南美洲和整个世界了。試問張伯倫先生還是仍然憧着四强合作「安定歐洲」的計劉呢？總是寧願犧牲以流血的手殺來的而大英帝國賴以生存的殖民地呢？試問達拉第和龐萊先生除了已使法蘭西的四肢帶上了法西斯的鐐銬之外是否還要把有着爲自由，獨立而鬥爭的光榮傳統的法蘭西送上斷頭台呢！再不要夢想用新華盛頓會議或新洛迦諾公約一類的東西來解决世界問題了，法西斯强盜早已擺着戰爭的架子企圖以威脅來重分世界的財富資源了！</p>

<p>現在先說在中條南北的紅槍會。紅槍會是迷信的組織，可是它在中條南北分佈的非常普遍。在中條南麗，是分佈在六個村子里，那些村子，離×人陣地最近的祗有二里，最遠的是五里左右。對×人的陣地，形成大包圍的形勢。過去×人是採懹柔政策的，但是這些民衆不聽他的鬼計，常常在夜間出去割電綫，或是襲擊×人的騎兵，因此×人對這些武裝，是進行圍攻了。前後打過三仗。第一仗是二月十三日，接關之下，×人死傷十餘，紅搶會會員也死傷十餘人；第二仗是三月十一，這次是因爲站崗的疏忽，給×人在里夜摸進村來的，當時扛槍會羣衆據險抵抗，一面掩護老弱退到山上去。由半夜打到天亮，結果×人是進了村了，但是什麼也得不到，而紅槍會會員一無所傷，×人于氣憤之餘，把留在村里走不動的老頭子六人，打死了之後便退囘去了。第三次是三月廿日晚上，×人又來了，可是民衆受過兩次敎訓，此次防守更嚴密，結果×人祇好退囘去。</p>
<p>那一帶的紅槍食，武器大半是刀，矛。槍校不多，現在駐防當地的××軍答應給他接濟，我想他會逐漸擴大起來的。</p>
<p>中條山北，和山南的紅搶會是稍有不同，雖然他們是在同一系統之下的組織，但是對于×人的應付其改以「親籌」的面目了。他們之所以如此，因爲本身有以下的缺點：第一，沒有槍枝，祗有些刀矛等；第二，新成立的組織民衆還沒有很好的團結；第三，×人還有些人怕他。所以和×人採取妥協的熊度：但是這樣的組織是龐大的，現在中條山北夏縣，聞喜，安邑一帶都有這樣的組織。</p>
<p>×人對于紅槍會的態度，也是因山南山北而不同的。在山南的即平睦一帶，是採不合作政策，當然他們沒可能把山南的紅槍會都完全消滅，可是他却用威嚇的辦法，天天由炮兵陣地里向村子里打大炮，可是最近這威縣的政策也不運用了，目前是一个對峙的局面。至干在山北的，是另一付面孔了。他跟紅槍會的會長聯絡，凡是帶有紅槍會的符號的，可以自由入城而不受到麻煩，卽如三月十日，夏縣的僞組織演戲而離夏縣十里的小呂村紅槍會，便全體武器入城參觀。</p>
<p>據調查，中條南北的紅搶會，最近已發展到七八萬人，分作：乾門，坎門，白山堂，黑道門，乾順會等五個道門。每一個道門有一個總會，而各總會最近有聯合成立一個的總組織之趨勢。這是一個龐大的力量，我們應該用正確的政策去爭取，以免被×人的懷柔政策所利用。</p>
<p>其次，我們說到自衞隊，那些是不說離生產的民衆武裝組織，和紅槍會之不同的地方，就是紅槍會是迷信的團體，而自衞隊不是而已。這些團體，常常配合紅槍會及我軍作戰，發揮很大的效果。</p>
<p>在山南平陸，芮城，垣曲一帶，除了由駐軍政治部組織的之外，大部是民衆的自發組織，武器齊全，如平陸風波村的自衞隊，有輕機關槍。至于炸彈，他們多能自製。日夜派出隊員，在村前放哨，盤問形跡可疑之行人，盡了維持治安的最大任務。</p>
<p>山北組織自衞隊較爲困難，但是在×軍無理的壓迫之下，也有許多人起來號召，而那些有錢的人家，並願自己拿錢出來買槍粗織的。據我所知，夏縣第三區的區長任魚躍，便自己拿錢到駐軍××軍去，買他們助製造之八響手槍，並且成立一隊武裝的民衆工作隊到淪陷區內做工作這些工作隊員都是靑年，他們每人都有槍，據說槍是夏縣縣府留下的現在工作已有好好的開展。</p>
<p>他們的槍枝，都是短槍，步槍送給他們也不要的，這因爲短槍利于貯藏，當大隊×軍來時，他們都把槍藏起，是馴服非常的良民，但是小部×軍到那里，準得全部消滅。所以×軍現在非二三百人不敢下鄕，百人以下的隊伍，下鄕之後是不易回城的。</p>
<p>第三，中條南北的游擊隊，過去是不相統屬的，散落于平陸，芮城，夏縣，安邑一帶，現在中條山的××，成立一個六縣游擊隊指揮部，才算把那些沒有聯絡的游擊隊聯絡起來。此外第八路軍還在×××有一個游擊支隊，現在已發展到×××了。這些游擊隊的任務，是去破壞鐵路，公路，消滅小部的×人。×人最怕就是這些出沒無常的隊伍。</p>
<p>至于正規軍派出的游擊隊，有××軍團一支隊，××軍一支隊。××軍一支隊，××軍兩團，活躍于晋西南一帶。</p>
<p>×人現在正用懷柔政策來對付民眾，許多地方，也不燒了，也不殺了。幷且公買公賣。借牲口給民衆耕田（據廿八軍團得報吿），對于民衆。極盡其欺騙之能事，其所編的「新民歌」云「中國聖道數千年，新民主義通大千，忠孝節義四德兼，天理人情皆齊全，用以治國幷不難；大家齊起扛上肩，比責此任本乎天。和平大道在目前，新民須棄舊習慣，最要洗心更革面，忠國愛人王道現，勿負天生新才幹。邪說流行當×看，千萬無令再傳染，從令樂土眼前見，共享幸福多安然」（見夏縣偽維持會編訪共手冊）。這些鬼話，頭腦陳腐者也會上當。至于對于游擊隊，則痛恨萬分，對八路軍則極其詛咒之能事，「哀八路」的傳單上說「八路游擊，不堪一擊」，但由此亦可以見×人之做賊心虛了。</p>
<p>中條山南北民眾武裝，是我們恢復晉南的最大力量，同時，由此我們可以證明，×人無論怎樣，也不能統治我們廣大的鄕村的。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>華南×軍擴大騷動</h3>
<p>南昌戰役以後、華南×軍卽已積極進行搜大騷動，汀門新會一帶的激戰，迄今未稍緩和，而粤南沿岸×艦，又有大舉進騷姿態，近日北江東江，以至香港邊界的形勢，又已再度緊張。</p>
<p>目前華南×軍的擴大騷動，其主要目的尙係爲鞏固廣州及其附近的佔領區，阻止前綫我軍的反攻和掃湯各地游擊隊，以便加緊利用我國人力物力迅速發動新的「西南總攻」。同時此種騷動，亦具有若干投機和冒險性質，他們很想利用歐局的緊張，由大騷動變爲總進攻，進則直犯桂滇，退則樹立華南偽政權。</p>
<p>目前我車反攻廣州的軍事積極進展，這是目前打擊華南×軍擴大騷動的主要辦法。不過我們要使這種反攻獲得實際效力，則不僅有賴於前錢戰鬥力的提高，尤有賴於湘贛閩粤桂各自民衆力暈的總動員，和廣東全省戰區及×後游擊戰的總發動，這裏就要祈望政府之努，於改進政治改善民生，這裏更要祈望各地僑胞之踴躍爲國捐輸，踴躍回國服務。</p>
<h3>遠東反侵略集團</h3>
<p>最近華南×軍已在擴大騷動，不久的將來，這種騷動的範圍也許會更加擴大，形勢也許會更加嚴重。尤其是日本强佔海南島强佔西沙羣島，以至最近又强佔新南羣島，×××××××××××××××××××××××××。一旦日本侵略者在華南獲得若干被誇大的「勝利」，則遠東大禍亂的爆發，决不會是梢久的將來的事！</p>
<p>這種形勢，自然更因目前意大利强佔阿爾巴尼亞，及德國的繼續新的進攻，而更嚴重化了。</p>
<p>今日報載東京消息，英駐海峽殖民地督湯姆斯，最近聘訪蘇聯，與暹政府簽訂互不侵犯公約，又謂越南對滬態度亦已轉趨親善，英法已有積極組織遠東反侵略集團的趨勢；這個消息雖不免爲東京方面的神經過敏，但確是日本侵略者所最懼怕的挽救遠東危局的唯一辦法，英勇抗戰的中國，自然歡迎這種反侵略集團的運動，並樂觀厥成，但是最主要的，首先要使中國佔有極重要的平等地位，其次是要有蘇，和美國的參加。否則，英法合作的警吿，旣不會在歐洲生效，更不會移到遠東就變成槍炮的！而對付日本侵略者，不僅需要警吿，唯一需要的却是槍砲，是環響日本的中，蘇，美，英，法各國合適用的槍砲。</p>
<h3>德意必敗論（續完）</h3>
<p>— 楊璧譯</p>
<p>可是，意大利與德國的人們，可別太小覷人家了。實在的，英法聯合下的海軍，是足够睥睨整個世界的。不論是遠東或近東；中亞爾亞或小亞細亞，地中海或大西洋，甚至於南非航綫，印度與波斯國，以及英法兩國自己的領水，差不多完全在他們海軍的控制之下。</p>
<p>只要，英法海軍能把英法人民食料，與工業製造原料的供應，維持源源不斷地，自美洲，自治領地，非洲及印度一帶運來；那麽，英法簡直是無懈可擊。要是有，也只是空中威晉的問題。</p>
<p>法國人也許得自薩伏亞撤退，也許還要失去了突尼斯與尼斯，甚至於連科西嘉也保不住。意大利與德國也許會分割了瑞士，攫尊了荷蘭，比利時，丹麥，以及北非土地；覇佔了西班牙，甚至於馳騁到老遠的近東與土耳其政，成了這生面世界中，治與經濟的主宰，但這一切，却不能令意大利與德國如意的速戰速决和速勝</p>
<p>戰爭仍然得繼續下去，一直要到倫敦與巴黎，或米蘭與慕尼黑，連一塊磚瓦都不留的時候，才能算是歇手，只要英法兩國的八千七百萬人民及海外募來的軍隊，能死守住本國的陸地陣綫，接養維持不斷，海軍再能把軸心國家封鎖化西戰——波雜的海，黑海及蘇聯領土一帶那麽不論軸心國家，把這場戰爭，打得怎樣野蠻與殘酷，會是徒勞的，軸心國家，一定不會勝。</p>
<p>他們不能得勝，因爲他們根本不能獲得一次决勝點，那變成持久戰了，這樣，他們在髙速度與髙代價下，所完成的一切戰爭準備，一定遠較民主國家按步就規與較低成本的準備，來得容易崩潰。那麼，等着瞧希特勒與莫索里尼的聲嘶力竭吧！</p>
<p>這便是德國與意大利所以始終長懼眞正戰爭爆發的主因。他們自己挺明白，在和平的談判中，他們很容易佔據上風。近年來的一串事實，截到慕尼黑協定爲止，他們是步步高升，討盡便宜。但，如果戰爭的恐嚇，一旦眞的揭開了戰爭，一切全完了，勝利的迷夢，一定粉碎；剩下的，死路一條。</p>
<p>所以，我說，如果第二次歐洲大戰眞的發生，軸心國家是必敗的。</p>
<p>因此，我們也可以知道，軸心國是根本畏戰的，只要，民主國家不再因循苟安，肩起予打擊者以打擊的担子，軸心國家的暴行，是一定斂勤的。</p>

<h3>慰問負傷空軍將士　又是一串抗戰必勝的活生生事實</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>慰問負傷空軍將士去</p>
<p>髙興極了！我們有了機緣慰問嘗經騰空爲我們四萬五千萬同胞吐口悶氣，爲我們整個中華民國爭取「國格」而負傷的我空軍將士。昨天下午，在風和日暖之下，記者跟業餘聯誼社十幾位熱情的男女朋友，帶着一片赤誠的心，到我負傷空軍將士休養的地方——××醫院慰問去。</p>
<p>踏進醫院門檻，盼不得立刻就在我空軍將十的跟前，握住嘗經替我們打擊過×人的手掌。在黄昌琳將士的。門前，輕輕地鼔着門。一位體格很壯健，肌肉堅實，負傷的左巴腫得一個包大的模樣，說託還不大自然，身上着了睡衣的黄昌琳先生，就開門迎接我們。經我們證明來意之後，他很髙輿地到隔壁的房間請另二位負傷的空軍伙伴來自我們，都是矯健活潑的靑年，一位是笑笑地策着木脚一柺一柺地跳進來，一位是負傷的右眼還被藥棉　帶包裹着。是三人中最年靑的一位，還戰着航學學校的制帽，一見我們就舉手見禮，我們連忙灣着腰，上前握着手，表示崇髙的敬意。虔誠帶來的美麗鮮花，國產水菓和書藉，報紙，就在致慰問詞之後，献給這三位可愛可敬的空軍將士的面前。</p>
<p>他們說了一些謙遜的客氣話之後，就相繼向我們報吿抗戰的經過，和我國空軍的光明前途，使我們聽了無限感奮，無限歡慰。</p>
<p>以寡敵衆還可以打勝仗</p>
<p>黄昌琳先生，桂籍，是空軍第×大隊第×隊副隊長，學識和經騐都很豐富，嘗任過敎練駕駛的是新式的蘇聯機。痛擊×機之後負傷的地方是在衡陽。傷右眼的是魏唐，傷足部的是徐靈漢，他們二位都是浙籍，是老同學亦是同隊的伙伴。都是技術髙明的靑年空軍將士。痛擊×機取得最大代價之後，魏君在芷江負傷，徐君是在昆明負傷。據謂×我機數相等時，我足可以把×機打得落化流水，要是機數少×機一半，我還可以操勝。如果是機數只當×機三分之一，尙可以免强應戰。武漢空軍大勝，就是事實的證明。其他各戰場亦是這樣們他三位的受傷都是以寡敵衆，結果還是打了勝仗，爭得最大的代價，才因爲奮不顧身而被迫降下。好像魏君受傷之役，就是以八架對×機十五架之衆，還打落×機四架，當時魏君滿身中彈，昏了三十四天才甦醒過來，由運輸機運到重慶去，後來才奉命飛來香港治療。黄徐二君受傷的經過，亦是可歌可頌的一頁抗×血戰史。</p>
<p>三位空軍將士對於僑胞的願望</p>
<p>所吃的虧是機太少數</p>
<p>當我們聽到「把×機打落之後，忽然又有×機成十架向我們包圍，拚命和他們衝擊之後，因爲機損身傷，不得已才以無線電吿知他機而降下。我們的受傷，本來都是不應該有的現象，全是因爲機數太少所吃的虧。」眞使人肅然致敬。我們冉詢問何以機數少×機一半，還能够把握打勝呢？據他們三位的報吿，我們的新機固然亦是很够力量，但是侵略早有準備的×磯亦未嘗可以輕視。克服×人，制勝×機，就完全端賴精神作用了。</p>
<p>精神克服物質</p>
<p>他們的校訓是：『我們的身體，飛機，炸彈，準備和×人的兵艦，陣地同歸於盡』！我英勇的空軍將士，個個都是校訓的實踐者。有國家民族，而沒有個人的一切。要是精神不佳，航空當局允許其請假，而沒有絲毫的勉强。使月是騰空的，就是要一以當十，抱必勝的决心。尤其使人聽了感奮的是：『當我們到了最危險的時候，就固意駛自己的機去和×機相碰，使之同歸於盡！可是，×機師給我們看穿了！很多空軍部有同樣的經驗，當我機接其近機邊將要相碰時，他馬上避開，逃逸去了！——路是從沒有路打出來的，生是從死的決心來的，這裏又得到一個活生生的事實作證。那麽，這樣看來，×機師的精　比我空軍的精神就差得多了；他們三位衆口同聲似的答謂：『那是當然啦！他們除了奉命之外，事實上是厭戰的。我們除了奉命之外，個個都認爲這是爲了國家民族的生存非拚命不可的。』眞是偉大，光榮的新中國的新空軍。</p>
<p>國際的同情與帮助</p>
<p>他們三位，尤其是健談的魏君，滔滔地把　國空軍如何去遠日本，武漢擊落×機何以有那樣驚人的成績，一串串的專門名詞，和各種飛機的馬力與作戰方式如家　似的講給我聽。應了我們的詢問，還謂：『國際志願軍的機師物質的帮助，亦是使我們非常感奮的。尤其是蘇聯的機師與我們時常在一起。非常親密，他們都認爲中國的抗戰，亦是爲全世界的公理與正義而戰』。</p>
<p>中國新空軍的光榮前途</p>
<p>『至於我們的新空軍，在最近將有一大批可以建立起來了。』黃隊長還很負責地說：「我們空軍是個個以身許國的，中國的新空軍，絕對是有光明的前途的。這是足以吿慰國人的」我們聽了眞是感奮到極點。</p>
<p>談了足足二個鐘點，我們在高度的感動中，同行的幾位小姐唱了『慰勞傷兵」和「中國不會亡」的二支歌曲，之後，就依不　似的，握手道別。</p>
<p>「中國不會亡！中國不會亡！……」在歸途中我們還是這樣唱着。</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇　上海影人在四川　服飾是四川人模倣的對象</h3>
<p>大隊的電影藝人們、前歲在抗戰軍興以後同於「上海影人劇團」組織之下，挾往時銀幕聲威、長征入川、表演救亡戲劇、當下在重慶成都各地、曾熱烈轟動、受衆觀們的盛大歡迎、同時在救亡工作方面、也正是一個具有絕大效能的有力宣傳、他們在成都一地、客居最久、直到還有很多人在作長期公演、起先、他們在初到那裏的時候、當地許多靑年士女將這一大羣時代尖端的人物、亦步亦趨、事事仿效，尤其關於服飾方面、更曾鬧出了不少趣話、</p>
<p>足赤革履白楊劉莉影等一般女明星、那時因値秋熱未退、很多人都還露出具有誘惑力的玉踝、赤足革履、不着襪子、重慶的娘兒們爲此業界新開、紛紛脫襪不遑、竟誇時髦、甚且效而尤之、有些穿着普通鞋子的時代女性、也都不着襪子、居然很迅捷的形成了一時風尙、</p>
<p>絨球帽子一種兒童式的頂上綴有大絨球的絨綫帽子、有些男演昌們原於客邸中用作睡帽的，一天，有人演戲下場、偶然戴着這帽子到劇場裏去跑上幾次、許多靑年觀衆以為它是上海新流行的式子、不上幾天工夫、成都市上，使見爭起效尤、風行一時、馬路上熙來接往的靑年們、大家這樣戴上一頂、帽色紅絲深淺，各類俱備、蔚爲奇觀、全市帽子店裏亦多趕製應市、每頂售價昂至二三元、尙屬供不應求、眞是一筆額外的大好生意、</p>
<p>緞帶束髪白楊有一次上照相館去拍照、她爲沒有新裝、一時忽動妙思、將所服絨綫外衣上的一條腰帶解了下來、紗在頭上權充緞帶、帶子兩端的大絨毬那樣斜缀　角、模樣甚見別緻、後來、照相館把這照片陳列在當街玻璃廚中，頓時引起衆女流屬目、大家忙着照式打扮起來、又成爲了一種很流行的新「翻新」、</p>
<p>旗袍外套更可發笑的事是、施超、卓曼麗、她爲未將大衣帶去、入冬天氣驟寒、身上還仍穿着單　的旗袍、施超一時無奈，因將自己一襲上裝給她穿上暫以禦寒、不想當地女娘們一經發現、竟有認爲也是很新式的時髦服裝、都是紛紛盲從、而不讓卓　麗一人專美了</p>
<p>諸如此　的笑話、在蓉渝兩地、委實鬧得不少、發噱之至、就此一點看來、那些電影藝人表演救亡劇的宣傳偉力、這也正是一個明顯的反證、</p>
<h3>好萊塢新片</h3>
<p>（一）“Ice　Follfes　of　1939”這是瓊克勞馥的一張族新的片子、她有着很美麗的滑冰的姿態演出、配演者有詹姆士斯蒂華、劉亞里斯、魯易斯東等、這是一張米髙梅的出品，</p>
<p>（二）今年大約是詹姆斯史華大出風頭的一年、你看他又和卡洛朗白合演、Made　For　Each　Ther這是一張愛情片、有着歌唱作爲背景、</p>
<p>（三）秀蘭鄧波兒的新作是一張五彩片Little　Prince據說演技之佳超過所之各片、而且有着極偉大的軍事場面、配演的是孚却格林，愛妮泰露意絲，西柴洛密羅、</p>
<p>（四）在銀幕上以哀艷細膩的演技著名者蓓蒂台維絲和喬治勃朗、亨弗來鮑茄合演Dark　Victory據華納公司當局說、蓓蒂爲了要飾演的這張片子的主角、有等待了八年之久、這一角色完全適合她的個性，演來當然十分精彩，</p>
<p>（五）克拉克蓋博和腦瑪希拉吶人從來未搭檔、但現在要在Ipiot，s　Delight這片子中演出了，並且演技都是十分精湛的、這又是一張米高梅的出品、</p>
<p>（六）去年出過一時風頭的　利方達、現在又和瑪琳沃莎利文台演Let　Us　Lfve了、享利飾一個馬車夫，是和瑪琳談愛情的一段故事、有離奇的情節、彷彿偵探片子、</p>
<p>（七）琴派克的潑刺、明朗的演出、又將一顯身手於Romanee　the　of　Redwoo中、和却爾斯別克福、髙登渥利孚等合演、這是完全以愛情作主題的一張片子、哥倫比亞出品、</p>
<p>（八）繼「孤兒樂園」之後、米蓋龍尼又有一張新作、Huckleberry　Finn、和他配合的有威廉凡來、華脫哥納等、</p>
<p>（九）愛琳鄧和却爾斯鮑育、這兩個從未配合過的明星、將有一張　感艷情的巨片拍出來了、那便是Sove　Affair、雷電華公司出品、</p>
<p>（十）在西席地密爾（這拍攝戰爭場面的大導演）的領導下、喬麥克利和白蓓蘭史丹薇有一張以印　戰爭作背景的偉大影片出現了、片名Union　Pacfgic兩人有空前演出、</p>
<p>（十一）保羅茂尼又新的作品了、也是一張歷史故事、和蓓蒂臺維絲合演、片中、保羅飾一皇帝，蓓蒂飾一女皇、兩人都有極佳演出、而保羅茂尼的化裝尤爲成功、這是一張二十世紀福斯的出品、</p>
<p>（十一）泰隆鮑華、亨利方、南賽凱萊三大巨星、合演的“Jease　James”算是今年十大巨片之一、這故事是敘述美國一個著名強盜生平、泰隆鮑華自「忠義　全」、以及最近的「蘇伊土」之後、已躍爲好萊塢巨星了、在這張片子中將有上分精的演出、南賽凱萊是好萊塢的新女星、芳齡十七、現為二十世紀福斯基本演員、在今年的銀壇上、她將放一異彩了、</p>
<h3>影星之中誰是攝影名家</h3>
<p>亨弗萊鮑嘉、人們都知道他是個銀幕上的惡漢、他那股惡霸的狠勁和陰險的面部表情、能使每個人的情緒都被窒息般的抓住着、誰都承認他和勞特瑙倫一樣的反派表演的天材、</p>
<p>可是、誰料他在銀幕下却還是一個有藝術修養的攝影家呢、他爲了顧着有許多要欣賞他作品的觀衆起見、所以就　他畢生的成績、公開的在紐約展覽了、他的攝影特長、就是能　和普通不同角度的鏡頭、而所　的對象、也喜歡專擇那不同顏色的貓、你們知道嗎、單是貓他已有一千多張的作品哩、</p>
<p>從英國來的李思廉霍華、也是個攝影迷、他說、一我照像時的背景很簡單、祇要一隻鋼琴、一隻圍爐、「隻能勾劃出的屋尖、和幾本放在案桌上的書册就得了」、倘然你們不能在攝影場上找着他、那麽你們祗要到幾爿大的照像館裏去、准定能看見他在　邊呢、</p>
<p>粗擴而帶有熱情的克拉克蓋博爾、也是染着　影嗜好的一個、有一次、把自己扮成一個獵人　樣、化了三千尺的　片、將　行獵所過的旅程全部　入鏡頭裏去、可是等到他歸來洗了以後突然發覺一些沒有什麽在上面、他方才記起原來忘掉把底片調換了、</p>
<p>埃洛爾林爲了要拍好的外景起見、曾和他的妻子麗麗黛密泰到　拉哥、新幾尼亞、澳大利亞、阿比西尼亞等的荒蠻地方去過、他所攝得那邊土人生活的照片、有幾千多張呢、他生平最値錢的兩張照片、就是曾經獲過獎的一張他自己和一張某國的國王、</p>

<h3>週末國際足球決賽　中葡人選均決定　中華人強馬壯又重膺錦標可能</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）國際足球决賽、卜吉本月十六（星期日）下午四時在　　埔場舉行、這幕好戲、定惹迷民重視、而月此是慈善之舉、出力出錢、都義不容辭、</p>
<p>迥情此項比賽過程、葡萄牙一戰而捷、淘汰愛爾蘭隊獲得决賽權　中　隊則兩戰兩勝、先克蘇格蘭隊、再破英格蘭隊、遂得爭標之資格、而於十六日與葡隊一決難雄</p>
<p>屆葡隊初以人材零落、欲放棄參加、後來宿將大吿由奴、小吿山奴、雷米迪、比路度等允爲効力、支撑門面、乃得成軍、而且一出卽戰勝愛隊、獲得爭標權、</p>
<p>六大錦標、我華隊已　其三、還有半數亦篤我華隊所必爭的、如　看來、包辦錦標，是可能的事、尤其這個國際英文星期報杯、不可不得、爲的是得失於國家體面攸關</p>
<p>目下華隊人材鼎盛、集精選　、何等堅强，更爲國家爭光榮、定必一心一德、完成此番偉業、</p>
<p>東方現在南遊、球人未歸、故此後要以南華旗下健兒爲主力、然卽使東方歸來，南華球員入選的亦必佔多數、</p>
<p>整個陣線、昨經選定、十一人中、祇有兩位姓候的不是南華球員、少惠堂　名列榜上、因爲此項是慈善比賽、他　　有爲善舉而登場効力的决定、故此番又要勞動這位仁兄了、</p>
<p>以前凡有集選比賽、郭英祺從未嘗參與其列、惟此次則佔一席、被任右前衛、爲的是他邇來反串此　、演出頭頭是道、故　遴選委員們所賞識、得以上名、</p>
<p>葡隊人選、亦經產生、惟金氏隨東方南遊、不能趕返以應此役、小吿山奴又遠客厦門、故此回葡隊陣綫、不及初戰愛隊時那麽完整、復遇着强勁的中華隊、這重難關、他們决不易渡過、且看大好錦標、將又爲我華隊所有了、中葡兩隊人選如、（球場太歲）</p>

<h3>漫談網球</h3>
<p>（一）網球的起源</p>
<p>世界上各種運動、在他們發起的時候、都是從很簡單的游戲、而漸次進化、達到今日完　而正當的一種迷動、佔有體育界上相當的地位、什麽足球捧球籃球等類、都是從這個演進的方式發展而有今日的、網球這東西、當然也免不悼這樣的過程</p>
<p>考網球的起源，實始於英國、當他們起始的時候、不過　把小皮球拿球拍來打、中間隔着一個　離的　　了、也沒有什麽一定球拍和網球、及其他球場和比賽規則等的規定、後來喜歡拍網球的日多一日、那就漸漸地改良起來、才有今日完善的結果、</p>
<p>（二）網球的發達於全世界</p>
<p>網球自英國創始以後、已普及全世界了、最先盛行的、要算是美國、並且美國對於網球的發　、有特殊的方式、就叫做美國式、世界上研究網球的各國，效法美國方式的也是很多、澳洲的網球比賽、也很有驚人的成績、他們的　人比賽和單人比賽、都可壓倒英倫三島、因因爲英國的網球、雖爲創始國、可是他們對于網球的游戲、毫無進步可言、紐西蘭的綱球進步也快、銳意改良、大有一日千里之勢、其他如德意志、俄羅斯、瑞典、挪威等國，也很有研究而着成效的、最近幾年中、美國的網球游戲、連續地研究精進，可稱他執了網球界的牛耳、國際網球奪　比賽的合維斯金盃Davis　Guq往往落在美人之手、不料異軍突起、法蘭西的網球、運用科學的方法、一　而爲世界之雄主、這幾年的台維斯金盃、法人已從美人手中奪來、網球的游戲、就　引起世界上人們熱烈的競爭了、</p>
<p>（三）中國網球界的近况</p>
<p>吾國有網球游戲以來、差不多有幾十年了、不過各地推行還少、內地各處、更是寥若晨星、不十分爲人家所注意的、不比足球來得普及也不及後來居上的籃球來得引人有競爭的趨勢、在此不景氣中的中國網球界裏面、忽然霹靂一聲的驚　了人家起來，就是在民元十六年的遠東運動會中、吾國網球家林實華邱飛海等、從海外歸來，竟然獲得最優勝的錦標、那不是吾國綱球界的榮幸嗎、甚麽日本菲律濱都被他們征服了、從此中國體育界中人、對於網球一項、已引起不少的興趣、將來蒸蒸發達、正未可限　呢、</p>
<p>（四）甚麽叫做網球季</p>
<p>足球和籃球等都有他們的季、這個季就是　種球在那一個時候比賽和練習、最是相宜、就定這個時候、爲某種球的季、網球的季是在夏天、因爲網球游戲、不比足球籃球等球類來得劇烈、網球在比賽的時候、奔跑上較少一些、所以在夏季裏天氣炎熱的日子、在早晚練習、較其他球　相宜、</p>
<p>（五）網球和體育的關係</p>
<p>網球是體育界有益的游戲、對於體育當然是有很密切的關係的、這句話本來是不消說的、不過我們究竟不知道研究了網昧、在身體上有怎樣的利益、這裏　不妨來講述一下、在我們比賽網球的時候、須有勇敢的精神、　靜的態度、活發的動作、不單是運用强健的氣力、因爲網球游戲、本來用不到其他像足球等珠類游戲要有劇烈的動作的、他必須要完備的就是手足要輕靈、目光要敏銳、還有身體要和心靈有臺力的舉動、雖然在發球和擊球的時候，須要用些力量、但是也不是沒有限　的可比啊、因爲所用的力量、倘使沒有節制、那末球的遠近就不適當了、就是在平常的時候、練習網球、用力也要適中、才可周旋於球場之上、進退得宜、所以網球在體育上　利益是動在運適宜，恰到好處，</p>
<p>（六）網球和智育的關係</p>
<p>網球在體育上的關係己在上面說過了、現在再說和智育的關係、我們知道綱球游戲、不單在體育上有益處、在智育上也有很大的利益、譬如別種球的擊打、或是球本在　止的時候、或是球的動處在地上的、可以從容地打出、若論網球的擊打</p>
<p>須在奔跑的中間、所以在沒有擊打之前、當想球從什麽地方來、怎樣來的情形、在空中飛行的情形怎麽樣、在地土　着的情形怎麽樣，那末我用那一種擊法去對付他、用那一種方法擊打才可以抵禦對方、剛才能够制勝、這幾點都要在頃刻之間、老慮起來、决定對付的方策、奪得最後的勝利、照此說來、網球的游戲、在運動之中、隨時隨地、運用智力、來驅使體力作適當的動作、所以智力的活潑、　捷和判斷、是在網球游戲中不可缺的、也就是吾們具有這種智力、才可以制曆於球場上呢</p>

<h3>眞正為體育而服務的體育欄</h3>
<p>— 卓越</p>
<p>香港的民眾體育、在表面看來、那觀球戲的觀衆、如此的踴　衆多、每一場足球賽的門券的收入、都可說是驚人的數量、在內地很少見到的、這種賽球時的熱烈的觀衆、可以代表香港僑胞的民衆體育情形、蓬蓬勃勃、很是樂觀、但實在的考究一下、僑對于胞體育認識、和實行的地方、都是很少很少、我想提高民衆體育的知識，和推廣民衆體育、而使到僑胞的體育能够眞眞正正的普遍發展在一切的體育社團都有密切的關係、然而事實上在各報紙的體育欄要負更重大的責任、如各報紙的體育欄能够眞正的爲民衆體育之發展而做一點工夫、把民衆蓬育用最熱誠的態度和方法去鼓勵大眾、使香港的僑胞、對于體育都能够有按本上的認識了解、而知道體育的重要有必需實行的必然性、那末僑胞的民衆體育知識的水準自然提髙、對于提倡或普及　眾的體育亦容易　行了、所以、我誠懇地希望今後各報體育欄的編輯先生、應該改變方針、不必默守繩法、死呆板地天天把什麽　隊　賽……明天比賽什麽秩序等等、記述出來就算了事、應該多用靈活的文　、去描寫體育的事情、和多徵求體育同志關于　育文學的投稿、使體育欄的東西都充實一　令到僑胞們在體育欄裏、直接獲得一般體育的理論和知識及各種　動的方法等、若能够這樣的做下去、香港僑胞的體育事業、必定一天一天的發達、現在各報之中、能够眞正爲體育而服務、致獲鼓吹民衆體育效果的、我想信只是申報的體育欄、雖然它是這操的努力、唯它單獨的能力必然是有限、所以、我特地把我個人這意見献給熱心于體育事業的志們、希望以後各報的體育欄裏、應該多載體育　論知識等、一方面使民衆體育籍以鼓吹、第二方面使我們的體育同志也可以得到切磋的機會，</p>

<h3>轉三灣</h3>
<p>— 孑木</p>
<p>『媽的，××鬼子怎樣兇，憑我們這條渠怕趕不上他們，把他們的戰艦活捉囘來。』轉三灣對村裏的一羣人這樣說。</p>
<p>「你打算龍歸烏石岩了，哈……哈……哈』聽的人笑了，在這笑聲裏　藏着一段故事：</p>
<p>從前某村裏有一隊賽龍船的能手，他們的龍船划得最快，祗要歧聲一下，他們已經轉了三個灣，後來在一次競賽中，他們划得　起勁了，一個不留神，那龍船像前一般直穿進了江邊一個名　烏石岩的山洞裏去，從此就永遠沒有出來。</p>
<p>『一鼓轉三灣，龍歸烏石岩』是村人唱着的歌謠，因爲大牛也是一個賽龍船的的手，所以得着『轉三灣』這個綽號，『轉三灣』的故事人人知道，『轉三灣」是大牛的綽號也楚人人知道。</p>
<p>自從暴×衝進我們的國土，抗戰熱情便騰沸在我們全民衆的內心。抗戰意識更深深地透入我們鄉村的內層像轉三灣那樣有血氣的人當然是憤火中燒，揚臂欲起。</p>
<p>然而×人更深入了，惡魔般的毒爪很容易又伸進了華南，隆隆的砲聲震憾着鄉村的四郊，漫天的火焰染赤了村人的眼　子。</p>
<p>『轉三灣，今年的龍船是賽不成的了，但是我們總有這一天要　進石巖裏去的呀！』一個小夥子拉長了臉皮對轉三灣說。</p>
<p>『……』轉三灣的臉上爆着幾條靑色的筋肉，眼睛發射着仇恨的光，嘴巴裏要囘答的話都給脹懣着胸膛的怒氣堵住了。</p>
<p>第二天，村子裏就不見轉三灣的影子，也沒有人知道到甚麼地方去。</p>
<p>砲聲沒有停止過，可是也沒有史近了些，四個月來那××簡直沒有能耐可以通過西江的封鎖綫，村人在刺耳的砲聲下一樣耕作，一樣生活，也漸漸把轉三灣忘了</p>
<p>在一個黄昏的晚上，殘落的陽光正投射在村前的池塘裏。轉三灣被發現一個人呆坐在塘邊的石欄上，穿的是一套褪了色的破軍服，左手給一塊從頸項弔下來的的白布裹着，瞼龎是顯然比從前更黑更結實了。一羣驚異的眼光包圍着他，一大堆的疑惑問着他。</p>
<p>在談話中他們知道轉三灣這幾個月來是當兵去的，也知道他這囘是因爲帶着花才囘來的。</p>
<p>『媽的，我就不明白東洋鬼子憑甚麽本領佔了我們的東北，佔了我們的上海，佔了我們的南京，佔了我們的廣州，佔了我們的漢口，單是那一條像這麼淺狹的西江他們就沒有辦法衝得過來，他們要是來吧，十次就有十一次給我們趕跑，有時連一个都跑不了。可是我轉三灣憑着這一條槳子，却常常衝了過去，又衝了囘來，從來就沒有吃過一點兒劇的。』</p>
<p>『好轉三灣！』</p>
<p>『轉三　萬歲！』</p>
<p>『中華民國萬歲！我們的村子萬歲！』</p>
<p>『打倒××鬼！』</p>
<p>一大羣村人聽得輿奮　了，就這樣吶喊起來。一個伶俐的拿出一根土烟朝轉三灣嘴裏一塞，另一個又連忙替他點上火。</p>
<p>太陽下去山，轉三灣被一羣划龍船的夥子們擁進了祠堂裏，他們湊了份忙着買魚咧，肉咧酒咧，就在祠堂裏吃暍起來。大門是關着的，偶然透出一陣狂笑聲，一陣喝采聲，一陣怒吼聲，最後就寂然聽不到　麽了。</p>
<p>第二天，村子裏又不見了轉三灣的踪迹，還有那十多個夥子也不知去向。</p>
<p>又是兩個多月了，轉三灣和一羣夥子們沒有一個人回過來，他們都進了石岩　？這可沒有人知道。但是××仍然衝不過西江的封鎖線，村人仍舊在刺耳的砲聲下一樣耕種，一樣生活。</p>
<h3>港行</h3>
<p>— 馬蔭隱</p>
<p>痛苦的心</p>
<p>劃破一度生的行程</p>
<p>孤寂地</p>
<p>我偷離祖國的懷胸了</p>
<p>這兒是香港吧</p>
<p>海的風</p>
<p>海的浪</p>
<p>海的霞烟</p>
<p>昏迷了海島</p>
<p>海島，像神話的靈怪</p>
<p>夜罩落神秘與奥玄</p>
<p>另一面，還有</p>
<p>戰艦，商船，占舊的小艇</p>
<p>橙色下的海的轟笑</p>
<p>是亂世代的桃源洞呵</p>
<p>一種古老詩人的幽趣</p>
<p>我停留下</p>
<p>這繁榮的夜市</p>
<p>掃去曾經沾滿衣邊的征塵嗎</p>
<p>兩個星期久陰</p>
<p>今天，仍是徘行街道上</p>
<h3>學習與實踐</h3>
<p>— 游泓</p>
<p>一個內地的朋友來了一封信。其中有一段說：『……我很想走到杳港過着你同樣的生活。要是辦法打算好了，我就如此做去；因爲，在香港可能地學到我喜歡學習的一切。雖然，說流浪的生活有點悽然，而我正需要如此換換空氣，並且，趁年靑多學習一點好一點，這不只是我的願望，也是我的計劃。要是今年來不及，明年也不遲，總要能把它實現了，便是完却了一個心願……』</p>
<p>過去曾有一句時髦的話：『學習魯迅先生』！學習　迅先生，學習他什麽呢？學習他的不屈不折的鬥爭精神，和他的學衞業績；換句話說，就是要採取他對於×人一種堅毅，勇敢的奮鬥，對於敵人儘用武器的輿秘。而我們以這里也儘可能利用我們的武器，去襲擊我們民族的敵人，出賣祖國的罪人；因爲，在這鬥爭的大時代裏，每個人都是難以避免鬥爭，尤是國難日亟的今日，更需要的鬥爭精神，這就是在「學習」中應注意的必然條件。</p>
<p>在香港的今日，有着很多的失業失學的靑年，而我們都需要學習學習，尤其是×我轉入相持階段的今日，戰區日益擴大，流亡者日益衆多，在這里一般有志的靑年旣可找到學習的機會，自應格外努力！</p>
<p>雖然，一般靑年在理論上有了相當的理解，而對於實際問題、却一舞莫展，無法解决，因之，我覺得我們的「學習」應該是「理論」與「實踐」的台一。</p>
<p>我是一個靑年，我也是在學習，在這一個特殊環境裏學習，我不敢保證自己絕不會受毒素沾染的危險（？）然而，我要從灰塵與煤烟籠罩着的黑夜，找到一片空氣新鮮的土地，我要耕開這奴隸的黑夜，去迎接黎明，這樣，對于那位從內地來信的我的友人，只有這一個答復。除此，我還有什麽話說呢？</p>
<p>最後引魯迅先生說：『對於舊勢力和舊社會的鬥爭，必須堅决，持久不斷，而且注重實力……』這就拿來當作與在港的靑年在學習上的一句共勉的話。</p>
<p>時代需要我們，我們要虛心地學習，實踐地學習，跟着大時代的車輪奔跑！</p>
<h3>蔣老公</h3>
<p>— 羅烽</p>
<p>『並不，』我辯駁看看『在前方幾百萬個戰士，不正在向日本××討債嗎？』</p>
<p>『你還不瞭解我的意思，我是指我們這一家，你看，兩位老人家都已年近古稀，當然是心有餘，而力不足的了；我大哥是位癮君子，而且，格雜種，又在計劃討小宅婆，你就算把他生牽到火綫上去，炮一響，他會嚇得發昏—我的老婆能上火綫嗎？——娃兒剛剛學會喊老子哩，格雜種，除了我，還有誰？』</p>
<p>大約一星期以後。我們正在吃午飯的時候，從深遠的裏院，傳出噪鬧的騷音，這聲昔，是由一個蒼老的嗓子，一個細聲帶，以及一個鏗鏘的聲浪組成的。我仔細諦聽，那鏗鏘的就是蔣老么，那蒼老的，據我推測一定是蔣老么的老子，至於那細聲帶呢？想係蔣老公的女人了。</p>
<p>白太太看着我端着飯碗發呆，嘲笑我說：</p>
<p>『你出去看看吧，你好像很關心民　哩。』</p>
<p>『你不知道底細……』我放下飯碗，鄭重地囘答，然後當眞向門那面走去。</p>
<p>『什麼底細呀？……』這就是飽煖生閒事，』她目送着走出房門。『看看就囘來吧，千萬別干涉人家的家務啊……』</p>
<p>最後是一聲銳利，短促的笑聲那里面竟含着嘲弄的原素，它浸進我的意議中，變化爲稀薄的憎惡了。</p>
<p>一個家庭婦女，最長於詆毀　的。而且怨恨的種子若是播於家庭婦女的心里，它會生出四季不凋的長靑樹。因爲家庭這個狹仄的世界，最不適於心胸開朗的人們生存的呵。</p>
<p>走到裏院的外一層房子，我看見了蔣老么，我的推測沒有錯，這顯然是爲了「辦法」，釀成重大的糾紛，蔣老么正在張牙舞爪地亂跳，老頭子頓着　色的長拐杖，彷彿用咳嗽來代替他言不盡意的話，女人像個半瘋，毫無理智地叫罵着：</p>
<p>『你還要喪良心嗎？……你提防着××××的炸彈吧！……』</p>
<p>『你隨便罵，』蔣老么把腰一彎擺揮　下手，表示不抵抗的意思。然後，他又伸直了腰，指揮房頂上，那上面正蹲着一個類似泥水匠的工人。</p>
<p>『掀瓦！』他這樣絕决地下着命令，『掀哪，格雜種！』</p>
<p>然而，老頭子却極力阻礙着：</p>
<p>『格雜種，要不得！』</p>
<p>『要得。』蔣老么指着房上的工人叫，『格雜種，給老子掀。』</p>
<p>『看你掀，』女人伸出利爪一般兩手，惡虎撲食地向着蔣老么撲過來，嚼着牙齒，喃喃地罵：『你欺服我女人嗎？你瞎眼，我怕誰，日本鬼子都看過！』</p>
<p>『××××老子也不怕！』蔣老么挽起黄呢中山裝的袖口，髙髙挺起胸脯準備迎擊。</p>
<p>這時候，假如我稍一猶豫，戰爭就必然爆發。老頭子眞是心有餘而力不足，他在轉過身向裏院不是喊誰求援，因此；不容我觀望了。</p>
<p>當我出現他們的中間時。蔣老么與那女人，都愕然地抽囘自己的手，但蔣老公却首先扯住我的袖肘說：</p>
<p>你看，這婆娘比日本鬼子都——』我還沒有開口，那女人又扯住我另一袖子，她說：</p>
<p>『我狠嗎？請你評評誰狼吧』她不是四川人，伹是她說話像爆炒豆似的，使我聽不出她是什麽地方口音，這兩間房子，本來是半年租銀五十元錢，昨大滿期，可是我早就關照他續租下去，可是他早不漲錢，晚不漲錢，昨天一下就漲到一百二十元錢，我求他少漲點吧，我是個逃難的。可是他說，糜少，若不就快搬家，可是你想，房子這未緊，一天工夫讓我上那里找去呢，今天早晨他來追我，我　房子難找，一兩天怕找不到，他說，　找不到，對不起，我要拆房子啦，這不，』她指着房子上的工人，『眞來拆來啦，請你評評吧，倒底誰狠。』</p>
<p>『你聽我說』蔣老么得到插嘴的空隙，『格雞種，百物昂貴，誰個生活都受了影響，我漲她點房錢還算額外嗎？』</p>
<p>『你漲五百元，你的房子，你有權力，可是你爲甚麽不等找到房子，就故意要拆房子赶我，你這個狼！』</p>

<p>蔣老，不慌不忙躱開老頭子的柺杖，左右擺起扁寬的腰　，氣憤憤地向外院走去，嘴里在小聲地咕着：</p>

<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>不曾一同樣是人類的骨肉嗎？彷彿是說，殺她的兇手，將不是他，而是她自己的父親是——祖國的叛徒，如果記下這仇恨，切莫記錯了這仇恨者的姓名。彷彿是說，唯願生　的不幸者而死後幸福，祝福她的靈魂，在聖潔的長空之上，尋一長在之所，伴隨太陽和月亮，永遠安息。她立刻打落他的手，以為它是被唆使尋找荒淫與罪惡。她望着他——已不是收起手槍以後的那低低能者，也不是用手槍威脅她的那個兇惡的暴徒，而是另外一人——類似一個無知的，也無表情塑像，這時候，加以夜色的陪襯，便她在風雪中的路上，更是孤　而恐怖，於是她恐懼地退縮着，想離遠他些，但她的手腕被握住，好像被一把鐵鎖鎖緊。結果，她祇有用兩腳不住地踏起雪地來，向外爭脫。爭持很久，而被握住的手，仍不屬於自己所有。</p>
<p>雪更大了。這雪，在未飄下落來以前，好像是一層一層的雪片，每片都是天面一樣闊大，不過，不飄落中被暴風打碎，碎成巨葉一般，落地以後，又恢復着原有的整體。這盤體，可以淸楚地看見，一層一層地增髙，似乎不讓宇宙間遺露一滴的異色斑點，似乎給全人類秘密地佈置着，葬體的祭壇，所見的一切，都是沉默的死者，凄冷的風聲，是來自天外的弔者的哭泣。他在這種悲慘的氣氛中，開始向她說了：</p>
<p>『我不能放你去，你又不肯隨我來；那麽，我祇有把你……打死在這里，請你原諒我！』</p>
<p>她從這忠懇的聲調中，似乎受了一驚；所以她不敢執拗地說：</p>
<p>『你打死我吧，』</p>
<p>『呵？打死……』她立刻又問：『你打死我，還要錢不？』</p>
<p>『你不要管了，反正就是打死你！』</p>
<p>『那你為什麼不可以放我走呢？』</p>
<p>『爲什麽？……爲什麽？……爲的是解决這一個工作呀！』（卅四）</p>

<h3>Intensifying Mobilization Efforts for Overseas Chinese Women</h3>
<p>The great cause of resisting the war and building the nation is currently at a very critical stage. Whether the nation can achieve equality and independence, and whether the people can achieve liberation and happiness, depends entirely on whether our current resistance war can gain the strong support of the entire nation's vibrant strength. And whether the general mobilization of the entire nation's vibrant strength can be truly successful, the most important issue is whether the mobilization of women across the country is successful. Overseas Chinese women number in the tens of millions! If we can mobilize all overseas Chinese women to participate in the ×× national construction work, then the significance of this will be imaginable.</p>
<p>In the more than twenty months since the start of the war of resistance, enlightened elements of overseas Chinese women in various places have successively served for ×× national construction work, such as voluntarily returning to the country to participate in battlefield service, such as encouraging male overseas Chinese to leap to the front lines, such as working hard to accommodate and care for children, such as mobilizing, organizing, and educating refugees, soliciting donations to comfort the soldiers at the front and the refugees in their hometowns, such as enthusiastically participating in charity sales and donation drives, all of which have established considerable great achievements, adding much glory to overseas Chinese women. In the women's circles of Hong Kong, due to the leadership and efforts of advanced women, the achievements have been particularly admirable. Recently, the Guangzhou Young Women's Christian Association has moved its office to Hong Kong and is now organizing a women's service corps to return to the country. Their spirit of sacrifice and service for the nation and people is truly deeply appreciated. This spirit and action of overseas Chinese women in our country in sacrificing, serving, and fighting for the nation and people has not only made a great contribution to the cause of resisting the war and building the nation, establishing the foundation for future victory and success, but also opened up a bright and open future for the women's liberation movement itself, greatly enhancing the political status of women themselves and gradually realizing the improvement of their actual lives.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, we must recognize another fact, that is, the scope of overseas Chinese women's ×× national construction service in the past twenty months has been very narrow, and its effectiveness has been very weak, and the particularly serious phenomenon is that those who can recognize and strive to participate in the service are still limited to a small number of advanced enlightened intellectual women and a very small number of female workers. The vast majority of women from all walks of life and housewives have not yet been mobilized to participate in all the work of resisting the war and building the nation, let alone how to improve their initiative and enthusiasm, and the lack of talent among overseas Chinese women's movement cadres is the most important reason. Often because of the lack of such cadre talent, the women who have already been organized cannot earnestly and practically contribute their heart and strength to serve the nation and people, cannot consolidate and develop the power of women's masses united, as for the vast women's power abandoned outside the ×× national construction cause, and consumed in useless work and idleness, the situation is even more unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>Therefore, the central task of our current effort to intensify the mobilization of overseas Chinese women is to train a large number of women's movement cadres. The first step is to widely and selflessly absorb those in overseas Chinese women who are loyal to the ×× national construction cause, have experience in national salvation work, and are trusted by the masses. We must absorb and select these people from all regions, all classes, all parties, and all professions. The second step is to establish various training organizations according to their temperament and interests. We must intensify the organization of battlefield service groups, wounded soldiers and refugee relief teams, and comfort teams for the families of soldiers going to war. We must serve in the motherland or go to the front lines. The first priority is to train personnel who are proficient in this work. We must quickly organize rear propaganda teams, mobilization promotion associations, children's nurseries, expand fundraising campaigns, first aid and poison prevention, ××××××, practice economy and expand production movements, and the first priority is to train a large number of cadre talents suitable for leading this work. In addition, while cultivating cadres for all overseas Chinese women's mobilization work, and when publicizing, organizing, and educating the vast number of women in order to expand overseas Chinese women's mobilization work, we should first enable them to acquire all the basic knowledge about ××, improve their political awareness, and improve their self-esteem and self-confidence; so that they have a full understanding of the united front, sustained ××, and final victory; secondly, we must constantly study the experience and lessons of the women's movement, especially the women's mobilization organization and education work, and constantly participate in all practical women's movements, and grow and unite in the process of combining theory and practice.</p>
<p>If overseas Chinese women can be mobilized in unison, they will surely generate great assistance to the great cause of ×× national construction and the national liberation movement; at the same time, they will show a very significant impetus for the women's liberation movement. Especially in this critical stage of ×× national construction, intensifying the mobilization of overseas Chinese women has become the central task of the current overseas Chinese women's movement. We hope that overseas Chinese women from all walks of life will recognize their important position and task in the current stage, and automatically and actively rise up and work hard. We also hope that the government and people from all walks of life will immediately provide practical and effective help in every appropriate way.</p>
<h3>The Youth National Salvation Corps in Southeastern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Changzhi Correspondent] The Youth National Salvation Corps of the Fifth Administrative District of Southeastern Shanxi was formally established on February 3. More than 80 representatives from all walks of life in the five districts attended, except for Fushan, representing more than 40,000 members, including different classes, beliefs, occupations, genders, and youth, united in spirit and gathered together.</p>
<p>At the meeting, the preparatory committee first reported on the preparation process and expressed deep gratitude to the local military and political officials, the Sacrifice League, the Gongdao League, and the leaders and helpers of various national salvation organizations. Secondly, Yan Wei, the commander, Zhu Peng, the deputy commander, Feng Rong, the second commissioner, and Ma Junguo, the leader of the Hui people, and other fourteen people were formally approved as the honorary presidium of the conference. Then, Mr. Shi Min, the representative of the presidium, delivered an opening speech, giving a brief report on the current political environment and the task of the conference—reviewing the past and planning for the future. At the same time, he also put forward the conditions for guaranteeing the completion of the task: (1) the glorious tradition and valuable experience of the youth, (2) the work experience and lessons of the youth in the five districts in the past year, (3) the leadership of the military and political leaders and national salvation progressives, and (4) the efforts of the representatives attending the meeting. Among the guests, Section Chief Zhao, the representative of the Fifth District, took the stage to speak first, detailing his feelings about the meeting and expressing his appreciation for the youth's enthusiasm and efforts in national salvation work. He then encouraged the representatives attending the meeting to recognize the environment, recognize the important responsibility of the youth, and continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the youth. The interests of China's resistance war and the interests of the youth masses themselves are inseparable. The youth must fight to the end for the cause of resisting the war and building the nation, and he also said that learning and work are also inseparable. The minds and bodies of the youth should be armed in the work, and some of the weaknesses of the youth, such as not being humble, impatient, and easily pessimistic and discouraged, should be thoroughly overcome. Finally, he hoped that the youth could call on the broad masses of youth to participate in the resistance war.</p>
<p>Then, Commander × of the ×th Column of the Death Squad and Security Commander of the ×th District spoke, hoping that the representatives attending the meeting: first, shouldered the task of uniting all the youth in Southeastern Shanxi; second, led and educated the broad youth; third, mobilized the youth to participate in the war; fourth, hoped that the conference would pass a perfect program and gradually put it into practice. Mr. Wei Keming, the representative of the Changzhi office of the Shangdang Central District of the Sacrifice League, hoped that the conference would discuss the youth work line and cultivate and strengthen the youth's strength. Comrade Yang Jue, the representative of the Southeastern Shanxi General Trade Union, mobilized workers, youth, and workers to unite. Comrade Huang Yuan, the representative of the ×th Route Army Work Group, raised the issues of youth unity, unified learning, etc. Comrade Yang of the Women's National Salvation Preparatory Committee hoped that the Youth National Salvation Corps could help women's work. In addition, the representatives of more than a dozen groups, such as the Third Regiment of the Salvation Guidance Team, the Third District Youth National Salvation Corps, the Fifth District Farmers' National Salvation Corps, the Fifth District Workers' National Salvation Corps, the Taihang Mountain Culture and Education Publishing House, the Taihang Mountain Art School, and the Taihang Mountain Branch of the Youth Journalists Association, all spoke, and they all explained in detail the issues of improving youth life, youth culture and education, uniting youth from all parties, and establishing a unified youth front.</p>
<p>Finally, the representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Southeastern Shanxi Youth National Salvation Federation expressed his opinions, hoping to earnestly discuss the issues of youth work and learning, how to enrich the National Salvation work, and suggested to the conference: first, to mobilize the youth to participate in the war in an organized and planned manner; second, to mobilize and expand the youth to participate in various training classes (military, political, cultural, etc.); third, to strengthen and expand the Youth National Salvation organization.</p>
<p>After the speeches of the representatives and guests, the conference also passed a declaration of establishment, a letter to the youth of the whole district, and a letter to the elders of the whole district. It also sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Commander Yan Wei, Deputy Commander Zhu Peng, and Commissioner Tan Rong to express their respect. It was not until 4:00 p.m., after reading the congratulatory telegrams from all parties to the conference, that the adjournment was announced satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>A Month of Hard Study: The Life of the Guilin Wartime Journalism Training Class Organized by the Southern Office of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association</h3>
<p>— Fan Kang</p>
<p>Every day when the buglers lined up at the gate of the provincial government to prepare to lower the flag, we—the students of the Wartime Journalism Class—always had to pass here to rush to class. We paid attention to the national flag and saluted it, and with a feeling of joy, we passed through Zhonghua Street, which was filled with rain and muddy puddles. (The incessant rain could not suppress the sincere heart for learning.) We arrived at the dilapidated lecture hall in that central elementary school—but the activity of the young people made it full of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu Jiang strained his body to busy himself with pumping up the hanging gas lamp. The clumsy actions of a complete amateur made people laugh. This was the first day of class. - On January 1st, Mr. Jiang Yi rushed to finish his lecture on "Interviewing" and set off for Chongqing that night. For the first few days, Mr. Changjiang came to class despite his illness. He talked about the suffering he had when he first became a reporter and had no way to learn, and we—we are really happy now.</p>
<p>The training class was originally scheduled to recruit only 60 students, but more than 200 people applied, so the enrollment was expanded to 100. But there were still nine people who were not admitted and asked to "audit". The class was too small to accommodate them. However, those admirable friends stood outside the door to listen to the lectures, and eventually they were accepted.</p>
<p>On the third day of class, a grand "Teacher-Student Friendship Meeting" was held. Everyone introduced themselves, and everyone laughed, but they were silently in awe. There was an elementary school teacher who ran from a village two or three miles away to listen to the lectures. There was one who served in a newspaper office in another place and took a month's leave for this purpose. There was also one who was one of the brave "Eight Hundred Warriors"...</p>
<p>Our school should thoroughly implement teacher-student cooperation. At the friendship meeting, we passed the class's proposal: to presume that all students participate in the class's work meeting, and based on the many valuable opinions submitted by the students to the class before the meeting, we decided to live in small groups and decided on extracurricular work: a work practice team, a library reference room, a symposium, etc.</p>
<p>The work practice team published the Freedom News, which was edited by each group in rotation. Every day at about 9:00 a.m., as soon as the Central News Agency's telegram arrived, this small room, which served as both an editorial office and a printing house, became active. The students began to work as if they were really doing something. The editor-in-chief gave the telegram a rough look and handed it over to the editors of each column, and he himself edited the main news and wrote editorials. The editors of each column were also busy deleting short telegrams and marking "headlines". Everyone puckered their mouths and skillfully used red ink, scissors, and paste... "We want to strive to publish at two o'clock." "Break the record of Group ×." With these words, everyone's spirits were even more invigorated, although their stomachs were already protesting. One person threw away his red pen and rushed to find a steel pen to start mimeographing. In this way, our group of editors changed their profession one after another and became printing workers. "How much does our mimeograph print per hour?" "One million copies." "Be careful, the stencil is broken." "Quick, add gauze." "Oops, only forty copies have been printed."... Until the evening when the work of newspaper vendors was finished, the praise or strict criticism of the Freedom News by the students and advanced comrades made the hard work of the day the greatest reward.</p>
<p>The first symposium was to bid farewell to Mr. Xia Yan and Mr. Changjiang. Mr. Xia Yan recounted how he was expelled from school and even had to flee to Shanghai because he ran a publication in middle school. Mr. Changjiang said, "Let the Freedom News bloom like a free flower in our remote villages and behind the enemy's lines." Yes, we have an excellent academic environment and should open up a greater career!</p>
<p>Our hard learning life was in such a common response, like a surging stream of hard work. Once, in a collective discussion after a lecture, a student supplemented a characteristic of Mr. Changjiang's lecture on "Journalism in the New Stage," that is, from simple propaganda and education to the function of organization, which was gladly accepted. After class, the students braved the wind and rain and spent long nights visiting the printing and editing departments of various newspapers, so that the students realized the hardship of journalism and the eagerness of advanced comrades for our expectations.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and a month was really too short. In order to connect feelings and continue learning, the organization of the alumni association was proposed and finally quickly organized.</p>
<p>On March 1st, the "last lesson" was given. When everyone was a little reluctant to say goodbye, Mr. Chen Nongfei proposed the suggestion of "holding a review meeting", which was immediately supported by the students. The next day. At the review meeting, we reviewed the learning life in the past month and enthusiastically pointed out many shortcomings, such as the unhealthy small group life. We are not afraid of shortcomings, we want to move forward in correcting shortcomings and overcoming mistakes. We are a group of young people.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the graduation ceremony, many cultural figures and officials from party and government agencies came to give us instructions. That harmonious atmosphere was an unforgettable impression. Chairman Zhong Qisen said that the opening of this famous class was first of all thanks to the help of the Guangxi authorities and the many lecturers who were able to take time out of their busy schedules to teach. Here, what makes us all the more admirable is the old revolutionary veteran Mr. Li Renren. He came to give us a lecture on "Sun Yat-sen's Legacy" at the age of sixty. That day. He also came to give us earnest instructions, regarding us as heart-attacking warriors, hoping that we would intensify our efforts in the second anti-Japanese war, in which politics is more important than military affairs!</p>
<p>Yes, we should shoulder the responsibility of these "heart-attacking warriors". But for our loyal soldiers who use their flesh and blood to resist the strong ×'s attack on the city, we can't forget them for a moment. At the suggestion of the Alumni Association, each student paid a diploma fee of five dimes to donate to the "Friends of Wounded Soldiers Society".</p>
<p>Finally, that was such exciting news. Some of the students in the training class formed a battlefield journalism team. They planned to go deep into the interior to interview and carry out journalism work, which was undoubtedly a great harvest of the training class, which lasted only one month.</p>
<p>Carry forward the spirit of our hard study in the past month, students, the road ahead is even harder!</p>
<h3>Hengyang on the Xianggui Railway (Part 2) Friends of China in China (5)</h3>
<p>— Ye Quesun</p>
<p>Li Meng was originally a talkative person who could speak well. Mr. Jingyi's question was like opening the lock of a chatterbox, and he continued to sing endlessly. Li Meng said:</p>
<p>In my three months in China, the first question my Chinese friends asked me was about France's Far East diplomatic policy, and especially about France's attitude towards China. Of course, this is by no means an ordinary casual question, but an expression full of friendship, hope, and passionate concern. At the same time, I believe that the special attention of the Chinese people to France's diplomatic attitude is by no means simply because France's Indochina has a close geographical connection with China. It is because France still retains the reputation of a free and independent motherland and the nurse of international psychology and democratic institutions. Therefore, although France has not yet provided China with much help, this firm trust has always remained deeply in the minds of every Chinese person. Therefore, standing in the position of a "Friend of China" and as a Frenchman who still has the glorious tradition of fighting for freedom and independence, it is necessary to explain France's Far East diplomatic policy to friends who are fighting for freedom, independence, world peace, and international justice. First of all, France's foreign policy must be linked to the international situation in recent years. Since Hitler climbed onto the German political stage in 1933, Europe has entered its unfortunate situation, and this unfortunate component is gradually increasing. The ambition to establish a German Empire has given the countries near Germany a constant threat, especially to France, which borders Germany, and many small countries in Central Europe that have good friendship with France. Since the establishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the rise of fascist forces has increased the infinite crisis in Europe. The first reaction of European democratic countries to the threat of fascist forces was to try to conclude a compromise Four-Power Pact with the aggressors in 1934. Due to the excessive ambitions and demands of the fascist countries, the so-called Four-Power Pact went bankrupt. For example, Germany wants to focus on free activities in Central and Eastern Europe, and Italy has special spheres of influence in the Mediterranean and North Africa. This historical fact shows how France has been busy dealing with disputes in Central Europe and North Africa. Moreover, the Saar incident, the annexation of Abyssinia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Tunisia, etc., this series of tragic historical events further proves how powerless France is.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War began, the crisis in Europe also increased unprecedentedly; the fascist forces attacked Spain even more fiercely, and the Nazi Party seized Czechoslovakia without hesitation. Therefore, we can note that the development of the Sino-Japanese War and the deepening of the European crisis are proceeding simultaneously. At the end of 1938, France had to concentrate its energy on the borders bordering Germany, Italy, Spain, and other places. This precisely shows that France's attention is in Europe. At the same time, although France clearly knows that the Japanese imperialists, the culprit in the Sino-Japanese War, are allies of German and Italian fascists, and the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese War is a great threat to the security of Indochina. However, France is unable to help strengthen Indochina's defense because it is unable to take care of itself in Europe. This is a fact that the Indochina government and people unanimously understand that if Japan were to defeat China, Indochina's fate would be very critical. This is why the Indochinese people unanimously sympathize with China's war of resistance and have restored the name "Chinese Uncle" to the Chinese. This is also a fact that it was not until the end of 1938 that Indochina received some help from France in increasing Indochina's defense capabilities. The above facts tell us why France has not given China more assistance so far.</p>
<p>In addition to the actual reason that the European situation is too tense for France to take care of other things, there are some other political reasons here. Since the dissolution of the French Popular Front government, the fascist forces within France have also been constantly strengthened. We know that fascist organizations or conservative parties sympathetic to fascism in the same country tend to favor Japan. Therefore, Japan used the help of French fascist forces to set up strict propaganda organs in Paris with a large amount of money to anesthetize French public opinion. Furthermore, French political figures have also been influenced by many remarks from a well-known Chinese politician (referring to Wang Jingwei). He repeatedly said: "China is a weak country, without mechanized and scientific troops, China has no way to resist... Therefore, the best way out for China is to make peace with Japan." This situation has caused a widespread feeling among French political circles: If China itself has no confidence in winning the war of resistance, then helping China is naturally a meaningless thing. Moreover, the international situation is so bad that France can only give China very limited help. At the same time, if China's situation is really as this politician said, then this small amount of help from France is not enough to increase its chances of victory. On the other hand, this small assistance to China is just enough to incur the hatred of the Japanese. This example can also explain France's attitude towards China to some extent.</p>
<p>However, I must also report on the general actual situation. Indeed, the majority of French public opinion has always stood on China's side. In detail, all progressive and left-wing political parties and popular organizations fully and firmly support China. Of course, if they can get more reports on the facts of China's heroic war of resistance, then this pure sympathy based on a sense of justice will inevitably develop further, and its impact will expand and strengthen accordingly. Another thing we must know is that the Japanese propaganda organization in France is very sound, and the Japanese are the most skilled smugglers in the world. Now they have applied various smuggling techniques to propaganda work; on the one hand, they are venting how barbaric China is, and on the other hand, they are desperately drumming up how Japan is fighting for Sino-Japanese friendship. But we understand very well that all this is just a self-deceiving trick with no factual basis. Most French people know that the Japanese propaganda work is just trying to cover up its crimes of massacring civilians and bombing undefended cities and villages in China. At the same time, we also know that the so-called "friendship" in the mouths of the Japanese is just to let Japan be China's "only friend." In other words, "The Far East is the Far East of the Far Eastern people, and Japan is the only master of the Far East." But China also has the best official propaganda office, which is the fact that it has been bravely resisting the war for nineteen months without any discount. Without the slightest exaggeration, in the war of resistance, China has achieved a very good diplomatic position in national defense. We can deeply believe that with the development of the Sino-Japanese War, the majority of public opinion in democratic countries that sympathize with China will promote the governments of various countries to adopt a more positive attitude towards the diplomatic policy in the Far East. Naturally, France will also have a new turning point.</p>
<p>There is another reason that can explain the possibility of a change in France's Far East policy. That is, the French government now has to understand that Japan's actions in the Far East are absolutely not enough to conquer China, but are enough to destroy the interests of foreigners in the Far East. Economically, the French government will naturally feel that Japan has begun to invade Indochina. The so-called "economic cooperation" that Japan used to deal with North China has now begun to be carried out in Indochina. The attempt to maintain friendly relations with Japan in the Far East is really no different from a dream. Moreover, the Indochina government has proposed to France more than once to find ways to clear Japanese spies within its borders. Originally, the French government thought that maintaining friendly relations with Japan was the best strategy to ensure the security of Indochina, but the facts tell us that when the Czech crisis was very serious and people all over the world were waiting for the arrival of World War II. Nine Japanese warships began to patrol around Weizhou Island and Paracel Islands and approached the Indochina coastline—there is no doubt that if the European war really breaks out; Japan will immediately land in Indochina. I believe that the lessons of these two facts will make the French government realize that the only way to ensure the security of Indochina and maintain the Nine-Power Treaty is to help China resist the war and defeat the common enemy, fascist Japan!</p>
<p>Following Li Meng's long speech, Mr. Jingyi and other friends in the political department put forward many opinions on how to deeply understand the actual situation in China for Li Meng to borrow. Mr. Zhang Xiawei, the deputy division commander of the XX division, also expressed some hopes for foreign friends and how to strive to promote the progressive combination of China and France.</p>
<p>This banquet full of international friendship, and a conversation a bit like the café outside the Geneva conference, came to an end. In fact, it was indeed not early, it was almost ten o'clock, and we had to hurry on the road early tomorrow morning!</p>
<p>Since the fall of Barcelona and Japan's landing on Hainan Island, France has fallen into a situation of being besieged on all sides. The ambitions of fascist aggressors have no end; Japan wants to "establish a new order in East Asia." Italy wants to satisfy his "natural wish," and Hitler threatens to "arm and distribute the natural wealth of the world." If it is said that this kind of ambition to gain an inch can be used to seek the moderation of Germany and Italy by means of retreat, then the Munich Conference will solve all problems. However, the facts tell us that it is not the case at all. In his parliamentary speech on January 30, Hitler not only advocated the redistribution of world territories and resources, but also openly expressed his support for Italy's aggression. Hitler's speech has greatly reduced the value of the so-called Anglo-German Declaration and the Franco-German Non-Aggression Declaration after the Munich Conference. In the past, Britain and France could be generous with others' interests and sacrifice the interests of third parties. Now there are no Austria, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia... and other third parties that can be used by Britain and France as chickens to feed the wolves. Germany and Italy's attempt to redistribute world territories and resources has aroused direct and fierce struggles with Britain and France. Moreover, the problem is not limited to the Mediterranean, Western Europe, North Africa... but has spread to the Pacific, South America, and the entire world. May I ask if Mr. Chamberlain is still dreaming of the "stabilizing Europe" plan of four-power cooperation? Would he rather sacrifice the colonies that the British Empire relies on for survival, which he has seized with bloody hands? May I ask if Daladier and Bonnet want to send France, which has the glorious tradition of fighting for freedom and independence, to the guillotine, in addition to having already put fascist shackles on France's limbs! Stop dreaming of solving world problems with things like a new Washington Conference or a new Locarno Treaty. Fascist robbers have already put on a war pose and are attempting to redistribute the wealth and resources of the world with threats!</p>

<h3>Our Army Actively Strives for the Initiative, Changing from Defense to Offense on the North and South Lines</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 11th] Well-informed sources claim that it is too early to say that the Chinese side has launched a general counteroffensive. Although the Chinese army has recently adopted counteroffensives in several areas, it is all to seek strategic advantages. At the same time, the Chinese side believes that the Japanese army will now take action, hoping to completely occupy the Yuehan Railway. It is believed that the Japanese army will concentrate its forces and attack the northern section of the railway in order to join forces with the Japanese army in Hubei and Jiangxi to attack Changsha, and then advance eastward and southward along the railway. It is said that the war situation in the Xijiang area has recently become tense due to the Japanese army in Sanshui attempting to detour to attack Wuzhou.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 11th] According to an official announcement here yesterday, China has adopted an offensive on all fronts, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Guangdong in the south, either already launched or about to be launched. According to the past 21 months of war, the Japanese army has always been in the initiative position. Now the Chinese army will take the offensive.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 11th] According to Japanese reports here, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi has recently launched a general offensive on all fronts, and there have been fierce battles.</p>
<p>Our Army Controls Gan and E</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] The overall situation of the 11th is stable. In Jiangxi, we continue to attack Nanchang. The Xiangtang stronghold on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been recovered. The enemy is extremely panicked. The battle situation in Gaoan has intensified. We are still firmly defending the city of Gaoyou. The strongholds near Dacheng are all under our control. The attack towards Xiushui has made no progress.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to news from the front line last night, the Chinese army in Jiangxi has gained a favorable counteroffensive. The Chinese troops on the east bank of the Gan River are advancing towards Nanchang, approaching the suburbs. The Japanese army has retreated into the area. The Chinese and Japanese armies on the west bank of the Gan River are in a stalemate between Gaoan and Fengxin. After the Chinese army in Hubei launched a counteroffensive on Saturday and Sunday, it has also made considerable progress. The Chinese army is now forming an arc-shaped formation to encircle Hankou. The front line starts from a certain place north of Yingshan, passes through Zhongxiang Jiukou to Yuejiakou, and is advancing towards Hankou. Several hills in this area have been recovered by the Chinese army. Yuejiakou has also been recovered, and Yingshan is surrounded by the Chinese army on three sides and can be attacked soon. The Japanese army on the highway between Zhongxiang Jiukou is also under fierce attack by the Chinese army. The Chinese side believes that the Japanese army in the area is weak, and most of the main forces have been transferred to Jiangxi to participate in the Battle of Nanchang.</p>
<p>Guangdong-South Seesaw Battle</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] On the 8th, we captured Fuhexu in southern Guangdong and are approaching Zengcheng. Xin’hui and Jiangmen are in a seesaw battle. The enemy landed from Daxin Street and occupied Nantou. The entire city was destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] Xinchang telephone, on the southern road of Xijiang, our army once recovered Jiangmen on the 7th, killing many enemies. The enemy then sent reinforcements by warship from along the river. Due to the disparity in strength and to avoid being cut off by the enemy, we automatically withdrew from the urban area of Jiangmen and moved to nearby high ground to defend. In addition, the remnants of the enemy besieged near Xinhui City have recently been resupplied and are苟延残喘， but they still cannot escape the encirclement. Our army occupies the high ground north of Xinhui City, strictly monitors and continues to mop up.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] After the battle for Baisha Bridge (near Guanyao) began, after our repeated assaults, the enemy's formation gradually became chaotic. On the morning of the 10th, the enemy urgently transferred hundreds of people from Zhushan to reinforce. Our army is still confronting the enemy in the Yuangang Baifengang area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 10th] After we captured Xin Street, the enemy actively reinforced and counterattacked from the southeast for several days. On the 9th, the enemy on the railway front used many tanks to protect the team and attacked in large numbers, and used aircraft to fiercely attack and assist in the battle. We bravely fought back, and both sides advanced and retreated repeatedly. At dusk, some of the enemy retreated to our northeast, and at the same time intensively bombarded with heavy artillery, destroying all our fortifications, and then automatically transferred to the enemy's side.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shiqi, 11th] In the gray morning, hundreds of enemy soldiers, three tanks, and more than 100 cavalrymen in Jiangmen attempted to retreat along the Jianghe Highway to Tangxia near Fenjiang, where they were ambushed by our army. The two sides fought fiercely. The enemy soldiers were unable to support themselves and suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the original road. The enemy then radioed to the enemy in Sanzao for help. Sanzao sent eight planes to Tangxia to偵察轰炸 our army's defense area, dropping more than 100 bombs. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed. Our army was prepared, so the losses were minimal. The enemy in Jiangmen is now surrounded by our army on three sides and has repeatedly tried to break through, but has not been able to force it, which is quite anxious.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 10th] Zhou Mingyi, the company commander of a certain unit of our army, led 30 soldiers on the 20th of last month. When passing through the bottom of Sujia Mountain from Fenyang, he found out that more than 1,000 enemy troops were going to Fenyang from Wucheng. The company commander set up an ambush at the bottom of Fengjia Mountain. He let the enemy's vanguard pass and waited for the main force to approach before using light machine guns to fiercely sweep the enemy's intensive team. The enemy vanguard heard the sound and folded back and attacked the company. The company was divided into three hilltops, forming a corner. The enemy attacked several times, and the firepower of the guns and cannons was dense, and it was difficult to approach. From noon to Shen, the company commander calmly commanded, fought bravely, and fought fiercely for 17 hours. The ammunition was exhausted and trapped in heavy siege. The company commander was seriously injured and still held the only remaining grenade in his hand. When dozens of enemy soldiers reached the nearest distance, the company commander pulled the grenade and died with the enemy, making a heroic sacrifice. Five soldiers died at the same time. More than 20 people broke through. In this battle, more than 100 enemies were killed. The company commander fought the enemy with a few and never retreated until death. The spirit of loyalty, bravery, and righteousness is worthy of praise from the military and civilians of the whole country. It is heard that the government will give preferential treatment.</p>

The bullet hit a vital point, killing him instantly. Cheng was watching a talkie with his concubine, and when there was a loud gunshot in the film, the brave man also opened fire. The audience and police officers were unaware, and the assailant calmly escaped after the act. Cheng was 47 years old this year and a native of Jiangsu. He was a student who studied in England. His wife was the youngest daughter of Gao Erqian. He recently succeeded Wen Shizhen as the superintendent of the puppet Tianjin Customs. After Cheng's death, Wang Kemin made a speech in Ping, filled with a sense of "the rabbit mourns for the fox's death."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 11th] A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy met with reporters this afternoon and said that the assassination of Weixin government official Xi Shitai was clearly a premeditated assassination. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to this matter.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Article: A Vehement Condemnation of Wang Jingwei (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>At that time, I saw Wang's appearance after the fall of Guangzhou, as if he had lost his parents, which was quite enough to wail and howl. I thought that Wang would not avenge this hatred against [Japanese] for the sake of the country, and would be awakened to the plight of his ancestors. Little did I know that he was regretting that he was too late to "bend the knee" like Teng. The learning of great figures is truly beyond the comprehension of the lowly like us. Perhaps he deeply believed that a Czechoslovakia after the division of the "Suhe District" could be stable and prosperous for a long time, so he also made it known as a national policy. Our China had no choice but to obtain final victory, so many important points from Beijing to Wuhan were sacrificed with pain in order to exhaust the [Japanese] and make them eager to induce peace and want us to stop fighting and rest with them. Our officers and soldiers at the front and compatriots throughout the country are seeking real life in the midst of death. The real policy of protracted resistance has just reached a turning point, but Wang has forgotten it. On the contrary, he thinks that the more [Japanese] occupy our cities and the more cruelly they kill our compatriots, the faster we should surrender to the [Japanese] and the more harsh the conditions we should accept. Are you making such mad words to support the [Japanese] or to bargain with our own country on behalf of [Japanese]? With such a psychology of fearing the fierce and fearing the [Japanese], it is no wonder that you are afraid of [Japanese] bombing Chongqing and want to fly to the safe zone in Hanoi abroad, hurriedly responding to [Japanese] Prime Minister Konoe's establishment of a "New Order in East Asia" with "national subjugation conditions." You are actually going to send up the chance for the [Japanese] to be exhausted, which we have fought for at the cost of the lives of our entire nation, to seek peace with the [Japanese], so that they can rest and recuperate. After the armistice, the [Japanese] will rest for half a year, and when our people are disheartened and our military power is slack, they will come to sweep through our southwest again, wouldn't it be ten times easier than today? After such half a year, wouldn't the whole of China become Czechoslovakia, and you would organize a "central government," wouldn't you also become the President Hacha of the defunct Czechoslovakia? This is something even elementary school students understand, but the Wang couple pretend not to understand. If you want people to explain, the reason is nothing more than envy of Puyi, Yin Rugeng, Hacha, etc. Although they are nominally puppets, they are third-class slaves. The ambitious people of the three northeastern provinces would rather be displaced north and south to this day, knowing that it is more difficult to be loyal subjects of a protected country than to be slaves of a conquered nation. Therefore, the Wang couple want to persuade [Japanese] business circles and young students, I believe [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] will never want to follow Wang to Nanjing to be obedient subjects, because as soon as he encounters compatriots who have escaped from the three northeastern provinces and the occupied areas, and slightly mentions the little flavors of "bowing" and "slaps," he cannot help but hope to take advantage of the [Japanese] exhaustion, fight to the end, and seek escape from death.</p>
<p>(3) Wang's "example" contains three questions. The above explanations are enough to answer the first two questions. The third question is: "When German Ambassador Trautmann mediated, the people at the Supreme National Defense Council, whether in Nanjing or Wuhan, had the same views. Why would their views differ when Konoe made his statement?" I didn't expect that a person as intelligent as Wang would ask such a foolish question. Before I answer you directly, let me ask you first, why Wu Zhihui, the one from a county, always wanted to respect you and value you. When Li Shizeng and others begged you to be cautious about taking the lead on the first, second, and third of April in the sixteenth year, you suddenly issued a declaration with Mr. Chen Duxiu, the then leader of the Communist Party, on the fourth. I then unceremoniously scolded you madly. Later, you finally realized your mistake, and you think that it was a big mistake. Whether it was a big mistake or not, or whether it was your oversensitivity, but your self-awareness of the mistake at that time was indeed correct, so I respected you as before. By December of that year, you suddenly issued a fallacy again, and I and Mr. Li Shizeng and Zhang Puquan persuaded you to be cautious. Mr. Zhang even begged you, but you didn't say anything. When Guangzhou was burned and killed on the twelfth, I had no choice but to scold you again. You left the country in tears. Later, you felt that "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me," and you turned around and returned to put the Party and the country first. I respected you, and I have done so until now. I didn't expect that you are really a "political prostitute" and a "shaking element" criticized by the Communist Party, and you have come up with another alluring telegram. Naturally, how can we agree with your proposal of surrender? Mr. Zhang even regretted that he should not have risked holding the assassin in front of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing to save a useless person. The above history answers your question of why people agreed with you before and why people disagree with you now. It is all natural. If you really go to be a puppet, I am afraid that your promising children [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], so your confidential secretary, your most trusted comrade, because of his conscience, actually leaked your secrets. We truly feel sorry for Comrade Zeng Zhongming, because we have lost a truly loyal comrade who worked for the public and not for personal gain. Let me answer you directly again. You are using rogue rhetoric to hypnotize people with ugly tricks and falsely accuse them, saying that "Since we have advocated war, we should not advocate peace." Who said that advocating war should not advocate peace again? Who said that peaceful reconciliation is not a major national plan? But Mr. Wang must know that the peace you are talking about is seeking peace on the condition that you recognize Konoe's "establishment of a New Order in East Asia" on December 22nd last year. Don't you know that this "New Order in East Asia" is the "Japanese Bullet" and the "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Cooperative Body," and is it not a new term for "Japan's annexation of China"? Isn't this condition still a "condition for national subjugation"? Is your advocating peace like this not surrendering? Can it still be called negotiating peace? Can such submission still be called a major national plan? Is such a reconciliation not [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]? Is it any wonder that people disagree with your proposal to surrender in this way and [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]? Even elementary school students can distinguish between right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages, war and peace, survival and death. How can such an intelligent person like you not really know? Are you still distinguishing between peace and no peace, talking about the dreams of a fool, what is the purpose if not another one? Speaking of the main text, you must understand that if you are sincerely seeking the country and using proper procedures, such as the Supreme National Defense Council, to secretly contribute to the issue of peace and war, people will naturally discuss with you. If they find something inappropriate, they cannot deny it, as the non-mention of the Nanjing peace talks demonstrates. If your alluring telegram was personally delivered by you to the Party Headquarters for discussion by everyone, everyone would at most advise you not to dream foolishly and veto it. But you publicly went on a trip and publicly announced it, for malicious propaganda, you [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. People are pure, people are loyal and love their country, who would agree with your rebellious plot? Isn't your question of why "they would disagree again" foolish? The above is my further explanation, and it can be considered concise. But I hope that Mr. Wang will rein himself in at the edge of the cliff. There are still a few small questions that I would like to advise him on loyally.</p>
<p>(A) Some people say that Wang's publication this time only "gives one example" and has two other intentions (1) is what our friend heard Mrs. He Hua instructing "comrades" that day, she said, "If we want to reach the moon, we must first create a situation where the issue of war and peace can be openly discussed, and at least the issue of peace can be discussed as freely as the issue of war. Now the time has come, so Wang launched the first large cannon to try to cause agreement or rebuttal, causing a complete mess, trying to shake people's hearts and undermine the resistance. It makes [Japanese] laugh, but the Wang couple dare to commit such a [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] crime, and will surely arouse boundless public outrage. I think that besides your colleagues like Wang Liang, who else in China would believe this [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] propaganda and be swayed by you? You are just announcing your own [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. As for the rebuttal of playing the lute to a cow, I know that no one wants to defile their stinking hair. I am taking the liberty as a personal relative to make a final contribution. Mr. Wang, I think you believe in [Japanese] and do not believe in friends. You think it is true that [Japanese] does not recognize the National Government as an opponent. That's why you believe [Japanese] only want you, Wang, to be their peace-talking opponent. Therefore, you still superficially say what, if Japan negotiates peace with the National Government, you can assist from the sidelines in a private capacity. These polite words, I ask you, if you do not defect to [Japanese], what qualifications do you have to say? You can advise [Japanese] to negotiate peace with the government of this country? I believe that you are still dreaming this dream and have not awakened. You still think that [Japanese] only recognize you as an opponent is true and not deceiving you, so you are still calm and generous, very polite and very humble, to advise [Japanese] to treat the National Government as an opponent. But you yourself ask what is inside you, what medicine are you selling in your gourd? Honestly, without being polite, let me expose your charade. The content is that when the time is right, you will impolitely come out and say, now the country has been messed up by you irresponsible, insincere, and clueless [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], you should get out of the way and let me do it. On the one hand, you pretend to be compassionate and say, "Since Japan does not want the National Government to come out as an opponent, and the National Government is too embarrassed to ask Japan for peace, then in the end only I, Wang Jingwei, have no choice but to come out to save the country and be Japan's opponent," under Konoe's so-called "New Order in East Asia," you will jointly complete the great undertaking of the "cooperative body" of Japan, Manchuria, and China. Isn't that your couple's plan? This is not what my friend is saying blindly, and it is not me joking. In your statement on the ninth, you still want to defend yourself against the news carried by the Dagong Daily on the fifth about your [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], and refuse to admit it, but the materials and evidence I have obtained are more detailed than what the Dagong Daily wrote. If a lawsuit is filed, I will have to go to court and provide real evidence to prove it. At that time, you will have nothing to say? Stop.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>The People's Armed Forces of Zhongtiao Mountain</h3>
<p>— Jin Zaiyong</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent in Southern Shanxi] Both north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain are bases for extensive people's armed forces, where they are naturally not under the rule of the Japanese. The people's armed forces with the greatest influence are the Red Spear Society, the Self-Defense Forces, and some guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>In the so-called "interlocked" areas of confrontation between [Japanese] and us, the people's armed forces are growing there. They are growing and strengthening day by day, and they have the strength to fight against the Japanese army. The reporter recently went there, and now I will give a brief report on the situation there.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the Red Spear Society in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain first. The Red Spear Society is a superstitious organization, but it is very common in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain. In the south of Zhongtiao, it is distributed in six villages. Those villages are only two li away from the [Japanese] position at the closest, and about five li at the farthest. They form a large encirclement of the [Japanese] position. In the past, the [Japanese] adopted a policy of appeasement, but these people did not listen to his tricks and often went out at night to cut power lines or attack [Japanese] cavalry. Therefore, the [Japanese] have been besieging these armed forces. There have been three battles. The first battle was on February 13th. Under the Jieguan, the [Japanese] suffered more than ten casualties, and the Red Spear Society members also suffered more than ten casualties. The second battle was on March 11th. This time, due to the negligence of the guards, the [Japanese] sneaked into the village at night. At that time, the Red Spear Society crowd resisted at the stronghold while covering the old and weak to retreat to the mountains. They fought from midnight to dawn. As a result, the [Japanese] entered the village, but got nothing, and the Red Spear Society members were unharmed. In anger, the [Japanese] killed six old men who were left in the village and could not move, and then retreated. The third time was on the evening of March 20th. The [Japanese] came again, but the people had learned two lessons, and this time the defense was more strict. As a result, the [Japanese] had to retreat.</p>
<p>The weapons of the Red Spear Society in that area are mostly knives and spears. There are not many guns. Now the [Nationalist] army stationed in the area has promised to provide them with assistance, and I think it will gradually expand.</p>
<p>The Red Spear Society in the north of Zhongtiao Mountain is slightly different from that in the south. Although they are organizations under the same system, they have changed their approach to dealing with the [Japanese] to a "pro-preparation" stance. The reason they do this is because they have the following shortcomings: First, they have no guns, only some knives and spears; second, the newly established organization has not yet achieved good unity among the people; third, some people are still afraid of the [Japanese]. Therefore, they adopt a compromise attitude with the [Japanese]. But this organization is huge. Now there are such organizations in Xia County, Wenxi, and Anyi areas in the north of Zhongtiao Mountain.</p>
<p>The attitude of the [Japanese] towards the Red Spear Society also differs between the north and south of the mountain. In the Pingmu area in the south of the mountain, a policy of non-cooperation is adopted. Of course, they cannot completely eliminate all the Red Spear Society in the south of the mountain, but they use intimidation methods and fire artillery shells into the villages from the artillery positions every day. However, recently, this policy of intimidation has also stopped being used, and the current situation is one of confrontation. As for the north of the mountain, it is another face. They are in contact with the leaders of the Red Spear Society. Anyone with the symbols of the Red Spear Society can enter the city freely without any trouble. For example, on March 10th, the puppet organization of Xia County performed a play, and the Red Spear Society of Xiaolv Village, ten li away from Xia County, entered the city with all their weapons to watch.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the Red Spear Society in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain has recently grown to 70,000 to 80,000 people, divided into five Dao gates: Qianmen, Kanmen, Baishantang, Heidaomen, and Qianshunhui. Each Dao gate has a general association, and each general association has recently tended to unite to form a general organization. This is a huge force, and we should use the correct policies to win it over to avoid being exploited by the [Japanese] appeasement policy.</p>
<p>Secondly, we talk about the Self-Defense Forces, which are non-detached people's armed organizations. The difference between them and the Red Spear Society is that the Red Spear Society is a superstitious group, while the Self-Defense Forces are not. These groups often cooperate with the Red Spear Society and our army in combat, and they are very effective.</p>
<p>In the Pinglu, Ruicheng, and Yuanqu areas in the south of the mountain, most of them are spontaneous organizations of the people, except for those organized by the political departments of the garrison troops. They are well-equipped with weapons. For example, the Self-Defense Forces in Fengbo Village, Pinglu, have light machine guns. As for bombs, they can mostly make their own. Day and night, they send out team members to stand guard in front of the village, questioning pedestrians with suspicious movements, fulfilling the greatest task of maintaining public security.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to organize Self-Defense Forces in the north of the mountain, but under the unreasonable oppression of the [Japanese] army, many people have also risen up to call for it. Those wealthy families are willing to take out their own money to buy guns and organize them. As far as I know, Ren Yuyao, the district chief of the third district of Xia County, took his own money to the [Nationalist] army stationed there to buy the eight-shot pistols they helped manufacture, and established an armed people's work team to work in the occupied areas. These work team members are all young people, and each of them has a gun. It is said that the guns were left by the Xia County government. Now the work has been carried out well.</p>
<p>Their guns are all short guns, and they don't want rifles even if they are given to them. This is because short guns are easy to store. When a large [Japanese] army comes, they hide all the guns and are very docile and good people. But when a small [Japanese] army goes there, they are sure to be completely eliminated. Therefore, the [Japanese] army now does not dare to go to the countryside with fewer than two or three hundred people. It is not easy for teams of less than one hundred people to return to the city after going to the countryside.</p>
<p>Third, the guerrilla groups in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain were not affiliated with each other in the past. They were scattered in the Pinglu, Ruicheng, Xia County, and Anyi areas. Now the [Nationalist] army in Zhongtiao Mountain has established a six-county guerrilla headquarters, which has linked up those guerrilla groups that had no contact. In addition, the Eighth Route Army also has a guerrilla detachment in [location unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], which has now developed to [location unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. The task of these guerrilla groups is to destroy railways and highways, and eliminate small [Japanese] units. The [Japanese] are most afraid of these elusive teams.</p>
<p>As for the guerrilla groups sent out by the regular army, there is a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army Corps, a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army, two regiments of the [Nationalist] Army, and a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army, which are active in the southwestern Shanxi area.</p>
<p>The [Japanese] are now using a policy of appeasement to deal with the people. In many places, they no longer burn or kill, and they also engage in public buying and selling. They lend livestock to the people to till the land (according to a report from the 28th Army Corps). They do their best to deceive the people. The "New People's Song" they compiled says, "China's sacred way for thousands of years, the New Democracy pervades the universe, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness are all virtues, and heaven's law and human feelings are all complete. It is not difficult to use it to govern the country; everyone rises up to shoulder the burden together, and it is the responsibility assigned by heaven. The road to peace is in sight, the new people must abandon old habits, the most important thing is to wash their hearts and renew their faces, loyalty to the country and love for the people will show the true path, do not fail the talents given by heaven. Heretical theories should be [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], never let them be spread again, and then the land of happiness will be seen before your eyes, and you will share happiness and peace." Those with outdated minds will also be deceived by these ghost words. As for the guerrilla groups, they are extremely hated, and the Eighth Route Army is cursed to the extreme. The leaflet "Mourning the Eighth Route Army" says "The Eighth Route Army's guerrillas are vulnerable to a single blow," but from this, one can also see that the [Japanese] are feeling guilty.</p>
<p>The people's armed forces in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain are the greatest force for us to restore southern Shanxi. At the same time, from this, we can prove that no matter what the [Japanese] do, they cannot rule our vast countryside.</p>

<h3>British Emergency Alert in the Mediterranean: All Ships Ordered to Leave Italian Waters. Greece and Turkey to Join Peace Front</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, April 11] It is reported that twelve British and French warships, totaling about eight tons, are currently patrolling off the coast of Corfu. However, the British Naval Headquarters stated that it has not received any information about British ships approaching Corfu.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 10] An Associated Press correspondent stationed in Athens reported today via telegraph that several British warships have entered the port of Agistri. The correspondent's report was incomplete, as the telephone line was cut off by the Athens switchboard. The "Daily Mail" reported that the British Navy in Gibraltar has been ordered to prepare to depart within four hours. They are all prepared for combat. Gas masks and steel armor have been distributed. Officials stated that these measures are of a precautionary nature.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Malta, April 10] Air raid and border defense exercises are currently being held here. Officials declared that this is a precautionary action. Personnel from the Mediterranean Fleet and the Royal Air Force have been ordered to return to their ships for duty. Simultaneously, the fleets are ready to depart on short notice.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] All British Mediterranean Fleet ships that were visiting Italian ports left Italy on April 8, including the flagship "Warspite," the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, which departed from San Remo. However, officials have not announced where the ships have been ordered to go. It is only said that in light of the current tense situation between Italy and Albania, it seems appropriate for the ships to temporarily leave Italian waters to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 11] The British Admiralty has denied reports from Cairo that the British Mediterranean Fleet arrived in Alexandria on Wednesday. The Admiralty stated that it is currently unable to disclose the whereabouts of the fleet.</p>
<p>British-Italian Relations: Temporarily Avoiding the Termination of the Agreement, Will Assist Greece in Defending its Borders</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 10] The British Navy has taken emergency precautionary steps in the Mediterranean. It is rumored that Chamberlain will announce on Thursday when the House of Commons reconvenes that Greece and Turkey have joined the European Peace Front. The Prime Minister has ordered all air force officers on leave to return to duty and has ordered all ships to leave Italian waters and convene Parliament. After news spread that Italian troops were advancing towards Greece and Turkey through Albania, all parties were deeply concerned that the Fascists would take the opportunity to invade the Balkan countries. The British Cabinet has decided to temporarily avoid announcing the termination of the British-Italian Agreement, so that British-Italian relations would not be further severed. Moreover, since Franco expressed his closeness to the Axis policy, the future of the Spanish Republican government is also particularly bleak. This is also one of the reasons why the British government is disregarding the sudden abandonment of the British-Italian Agreement. As for Britain's attitude towards Greece, if Italy takes any action that threatens Britain's lines of communication, Britain will assist Greece in defending its borders. It is rumored that Britain has expressed this position to Italy through diplomatic channels. It is reported that Britain's guarantee to Greece is specifically aimed at preventing important islands such as Corfu from falling into the hands of authoritarian countries. However, the British Foreign Office has denied that the government has warned Italy not to attack Corfu and stated that such a move would lead to war.</p>
<p>[London, April 10] Foreign News: Britain and Italy have not taken any action against Mussolini in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. However, London is actively engaged in diplomatic consultations to obtain Greece's consent so that the British Navy can use the island of Corfu as a base. London prefers to use diplomatic arrangements to utilize Corfu Island rather than openly occupying it. This arrangement will become part of the British-Greek guarantee, meaning that Britain can continue to station troops on the island to prepare to resist Italy's attempt to invade the island. British diplomacy is more focused on maintaining the balance of power at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea in order to maintain strategic necessities. Britain and France are currently engaged in closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries. It is expected that the alliance between the Soviet Union and Turkey will be sufficient to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles, regardless of future changes in Romania. At the same time, although Romania and Poland do not want to join forces, military cooperation between the Soviet Union and Greece is sufficient to resist joint Italian-Bulgarian actions in the Aegean Sea to seize an outlet to the sea for Bulgaria.</p>
<p>British Parliament: Both Houses Scheduled to Reconvene Tomorrow. Greek Government Anxious and Uneasy</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent stated that the report circulating tonight that Britain is giving guarantees to Greece does not fully correspond to the facts. The situation after the cabinet dinner tonight has changed slightly from before. The cabinet is currently considering the necessary steps to indicate that Greece's position (including Corfu) has not been threatened after Italy's occupation of Albania. It is reported that the views held by the cabinet members all recognize that the current situation in the eastern Mediterranean is absolutely not suitable for any disturbance. It is believed that the British side has conveyed this fact to Italy. All of this, Britain is still working closely with France. At the same time, the British Cabinet's decision not to meet again within two days is sufficient to indicate that the current situation still requires a great deal of contact and investigation before the truth can be obtained, pending a report to both houses on Thursday (April 13).</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] Both houses of the British Parliament are scheduled to reconvene on April 13, but it is reported that the session will not exceed one day.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] This morning, while the cabinet was meeting, the Greek and Romanian ambassadors visited the Foreign Office. The Romanian ambassador revisited the Foreign Office in the afternoon, while the Charge d'Affaires was present. Labour opposition leader Attlee had a long conversation with Chamberlain for forty-five minutes on Downing Street.</p>
<p>[London, April 10] Foreign News: During today's special cabinet meeting in Britain, the issue of providing guarantees to Greece and the possibility of Britain sending ships to Greek ports if Greece deems it necessary will be the focus of discussion. The reason for the cabinet's meeting at the headquarters of the British Imperial Defence Committee is also in preparation for this action. The Greek government has informed the government of its anxiety about the approximately 150-mile border connecting it to Albania, especially its concern about the status of the island of Corfu, which is at risk of being attacked by Albanian mountain artillery. Political circles believe that Britain's guarantee of Greece's security should include dispatching British ships to Corfu and being prepared to land there at any time as the basis for the guarantee to Greece. The Admiralty has also canceled its Easter weekend warship visit to the Mediterranean Sea due to this.</p>
<h3>Britain to Change Policy on Palestine. Proposing Suggestions for a Quick Resolution. May Concede to Arabs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, April 11] It is expected that Britain will make an important announcement regarding its policy on Palestine. According to reliable sources, the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain is carrying British suggestions for a quick resolution of the Palestinian issue and will arrive here today. British Ambassador to Egypt Sir Miles Lampson has met with the Egyptian Prime Minister several times during the Easter period. It is reported that he has indicated that Egypt may be able to mediate the Palestinian dispute. As for the details of the British suggestions, they are currently unknown. It is rumored that Britain may make some concessions to the Arabs.</p>
<h3>British King and Queen to Change to Mail Ship for Canada Trip</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, April 11] According to the "Yorkshire Post," the British King and Queen originally planned to travel to Canada on a warship, but now they have changed to a mail ship. It is rumored that this sudden change is due to the tense international situation, and the warships have been dispatched for other duties and cannot be used for royal travel.</p>
<h3>Dutch Neutrality: Polish Alert Remains</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, April 11] Dutch Prime Minister Colijn gave a speech in the square today, stating that the Netherlands will do its best to maintain neutrality under any circumstances. He declared that the alert taken at the border yesterday was to maintain neutrality and does not indicate that the country is under any direct threat. The country currently has very close friendships with all countries. Therefore, these preparations can only increase vigilance. "We do not harbor any hostile intentions. We only want to express that the Netherlands, under any circumstances, will maintain independence and neutrality." It is generally believed that the government is afraid of foreign threats, which is inaccurate. The current alert action is entirely due to the evolution of the European situation. These measures will be maintained until stability is fully restored. At the same time, the Netherlands should work as usual and not panic.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, The Hague, April 10] The Dutch government has ordered the conscription of multiple army corps to begin border reinforcements. The reason for this action has not been officially announced.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Brussels, April 10] Several travelers have denied reports circulating about German troop movements on the Belgian border. The Belgian government has not taken any military alert actions at this time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, April 11] It is reported that unless the general situation in Europe becomes peaceful, the government will not immediately order the demobilization of conscripted reservists. Poland will continue to take various military precautions without any negligence.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Chamberlain Responds to Mussolini</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, April 11] According to rumors circulating in political circles here last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain sent a personal letter to Mussolini in response to the Italian Prime Minister's message on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Italian Anti-French Movement: Revived. Fabricating Reports of Maltreatment of Italian Nationals. Gayda Writes Article Attacking the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, April 10] According to observations in diplomatic circles here, the anti-French movement in Italy may soon be revived, as Fascist officials have published a large number of reports from Tunisia claiming that Italian nationals there have been severely mistreated and that France is working to create hatred towards Italians.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, April 10] Gayda today wrote an article criticizing the United States for condemning Italy's invasion of Albania. He asked that "the United States should mind its own business and not interfere in European affairs. The United States has not gained protection because of its distance."</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Democratic Countries. Proposed Huge Plan to Exchange Raw Materials. Establish Wartime Strength of Various Countries. Discussion of Neutrality Law to Be Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 11] Senator Byrnes has proposed a large-scale international raw material exchange plan, the purpose of which is twofold: one is to establish the wartime strength of various democratic countries, and the other is to solve the difficulties caused by the U.S.'s surplus agricultural products. It is said that the United States can exchange cotton and wheat with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and several other countries for rubber and tin. The plan has been approved by the Department of Agriculture and is supported by several influential figures in the Senate. Byrnes declared yesterday that the State Department will formally propose transactions of several large quantities to foreign governments within a few days. The Army and Navy Departments advocate that the rubber storage capacity should be at least 226,000 tons. If proper protection is desired, 125 million pounds of rubber are needed. There have already been requests to store tin worth $65 million. According to Byrnes' estimates, the government currently holds 11 million bales of cotton as collateral for loans to farmers. At least 2 million bales of cotton can be used for this international raw material exchange plan.</p>
<p>[Washington, April 10] Regarding the investigation of the Neutrality Act, the government-supporting faction in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that they believe that the number of Americans supporting the democratic countries to stop the authoritarian countries is gradually increasing as events unfold. They hope that the investigation will extend to the third week. Previously, Baruch's statement that there is no possibility of true neutrality has been widely accepted. Therefore, everyone is willing to provide financial assistance to non-aggressive countries for the sake of promoting the interests of the United States itself. According to reports, the true intention of this investigation is to make the isolationists understand that this move is highly likely and will not increase the risk of war. It is generally believed that senators who support supplying food to the United Kingdom and France account for 82 percent, while those who support supplying them with military supplies account for 66 percent.</p>
<p>[Washington, April 10] While President Roosevelt was on a ten-day trip, the Axis countries repeatedly stirred up trouble, and Albania fell into destruction, causing the White House spokesman to feel that the progress of the authoritarian countries was sufficient to reduce the United States' political security and economic prosperity. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has completed 50% of the discussion procedure for the Neutrality Act, which expires next month. In the future, the recommendations of the two committees on the Neutrality Act and the final agreement between President Roosevelt and Congress on this matter will be as important as any policy in the New Deal in the past six years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 11] President Roosevelt returned here from the hot springs yesterday and immediately met with Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau in the car. It is reported that the discussion was about the European situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, April 10] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently met with reporters and said that given the international situation, there is no need to revise the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval and Air Base Act Approved by the Maritime Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 10] The Senate Naval Affairs Committee has approved the $65 million Naval Air Base Act after rejecting the suggestion to improve the Guam plan. The House of Representatives had already rejected the Guam plan earlier.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting: Discussing National Defense Plan. Britain and France to Take Cooperative Steps</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, April 11] Today's French cabinet meeting will conduct an in-depth study of the situation in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Although the French Foreign Office declared last night that Britain has no intention of occupying Corfu, it is inevitable that Britain and France will take cooperative steps to ensure security. It is reported that several bills related to national defense will be passed at today's meeting to ensure that the country is ready to deal with emergencies at any time. However, those who are well-informed about this matter are still very cautious. In short, the national defense plan will not be revealed to the outside world until after the Council of Ministers meets on Wednesday. Foreign Minister Bonnet will report to the cabinet today on the consultations with British representatives and representatives from other countries. Prime Minister Daladier will also explain the steps the government is taking to ensure France's security. Political circles said yesterday morning that the atmosphere has eased somewhat, but it is very clear that France will not give anyone an opportunity to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, April 11] "Le Temps" in Paris published an important article yesterday stating that France is taking all steps to prepare for extraordinary events. Britain and France have established a joint agreement on preparatory steps, but the content is unknown.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, April 10] Morning newspapers in London and Paris unanimously agree that military strength in the Mediterranean must be increased, but there is no definite information on the steps to be taken. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Britain has decided to cooperate with the French government to strengthen its bases in the Mediterranean. "Le Petit Journal" stated that no one should be surprised by the naval demonstration near the Greek island of Corfu.</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister's Declaration: Advising People to Remain Calm. Rumors Italy Will Guarantee Greek Integrity. Yugoslavian Public Opinion Criticizes Italian Aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, April 10] Greek Prime Minister Metaxas issued a message to the Greek people today, stating that the government is very confident in maintaining Greece's absolute independence and integrity. The declaration also advises everyone to focus on their work and trust that the government will continue to defend their safety and honor.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, April 10] According to Italian sources in Athens, Greek newspapers will publish the full text of the Italian government's guarantee of Greece's absolute territorial integrity tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, April 10] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's diplomatic activities have been extremely busy since returning to Bucharest from Istanbul. After arriving in the country, Gafencu immediately met with the Yugoslavian ambassador and the French, Italian, and Hungarian ministers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Yugoslavian Capital, April 11] Although the Yugoslavian government authorities are still maintaining a reserved attitude, domestic public opinion has been fiercely critical of Italy's forceful occupation of Albania. During the Easter holidays, small-scale anti-Italian movements occurred in the Yugoslavian capital and Skopje. The newspapers also pointed out that Italy can now do as it pleases in the Adriatic Sea, and unless it takes the circuitous waterway through the Bosphorus Strait to the Danube River, Thessaloniki will become the only source of maritime supply for Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, April 10] Although Britain and France are actively preparing to protect their interests in the Mediterranean, they seem to have resigned themselves to the fate of Yugoslavia and will not provide immediate assistance. There are three reasons for this attitude: (1) Germany and Italy are currently pressuring Yugoslavia to submit; (2) Italy's invasion of Albania has cut off Britain's route to aid Yugoslavia unless it passes through Romania; (3) Yugoslavia's internal problems cannot unite. However, Britain and France are still consulting with Romania, a friendly country of Yugoslavia. At the same time, the Soviet Union still suspects whether Britain is sincere in expanding the anti-aggression coalition.</p>
<h3>Worldwide Religions Condemn Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] London Islamic leaders met today and resolved to demand that Mussolini rescind the title of "Protector of Islam" that he took after annexing Abyssinia and urged the suspension of the Oriental Studies Society established in Italy five years ago to protest Fascist propaganda in India, Egypt, and the Orient. The society has sent a delegation to the Italian embassy to present the above demands on behalf.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 10] The "Evening Standard" today published an article attacking Mussolini's invasion of Albania and its impact. Its catchphrase was, "One blow from the Italian dictator has aroused opposition around the world. People, whether Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim, have spoken out in unison to condemn it." The newspaper pointed out that no one believes that Italy's invasion of Albania is an isolated and limited action. It then compared today's British reaction with the situation in September last year, stating that the public's indignation is more widespread and that the previous sense of shock is no longer present.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Declares: Taking Measures to Deal with Aggression. National Assembly Unanimously Trusts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Turkish Capital, April 11] Turkish Prime Minister Saydam solemnly declared in the National Assembly today that the government has taken measures to deal with the events that the country may encounter. He said, "Fortunately, the government is well-equipped with military strength to deal with all dangers and aggressions." The National Assembly unanimously agreed to trust the Prime Minister's declaration.</p>
<h3>Italy to Announce Annexation of Albania. Italian King to Go to Tirana for Coronation</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, April 11] According to the "Rome Gazette," the Italian King has agreed to accept the position of King of Albania as well. The Italian King will hold a grand coronation ceremony in Tirana at the end of this month. Albania will be administered by a governor appointed by the Italian King.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, April 11] According to reports from Tirana, the Albanian administrative agencies have resumed work, and Fascist party branches have also been established.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Visit Rome. Discussing Relations with Poland. Will Also Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 11] According to the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in the Hungarian capital, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky, along with several officials, will travel to Rome this weekend to hold important negotiations with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. The impact of the Anglo-Polish Agreement on the traditional friendship between Hungary and Poland and the unresolved relations between Hungary and Romania will be the main topics of discussion at the Rome meeting. After visiting Rome, the Hungarian politicians will travel to Berlin to express the deep friendship between Germany and Hungary.</p>
<h3>Schacht Passes Through Bombay. Destination Unknown</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, April 10] Former President of the German Reichsbank Hjalmar Schacht arrived today aboard the British ship "Malaya" and then left for an unknown destination.</p>
<h3>Italian Reserve Troops of All Levels Rumored to Have Been Called Up</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, April 11] It is rumored that Italian reserve troops of all levels have been called up today to replace the Italian troops sent to Albania. It is believed that the majority of the reserve troops belong to the 1912 class. It is reported that the enlistment period will be very short. Unofficial estimates put the total number at about 100,000. The rumor that the British government will leave the Albanian affair to the British Parliament to discuss has aroused hope among political figures here that Britain will let Italy's actions pass by with only a diplomatic note. Currently, Italy is jealously watching every statement about the island of Corfu. Some quarters are displaying threats, stating that if Corfu is occupied to oppose Italy, Italy will send troops to advance towards Thessaloniki.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>South China [Guangdong] Army's Increased Disturbances</h3>
<p>Since the Battle of Nanchang, the South China [Guangdong] Army has been actively engaged in expanding its disturbances. The fierce battles in the Tingmen-Xinhui area have not eased so far, and the [Guangdong] ships off the coast of southern Guangdong are showing signs of a major advance. Recently, the situation in the North River, the East River, and even the Hong Kong border has become tense again.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the South China [Guangdong] Army's increased disturbances is to consolidate Guangzhou and its surrounding occupied areas, prevent counterattacks by our frontline troops, and suppress guerrillas everywhere, so as to step up the use of our country's human and material resources to quickly launch a new "Southwest General Offensive." At the same time, these disturbances also have some speculative and adventurous elements. They want to take advantage of the tense situation in Europe, transform the major disturbances into a general offensive, advance directly into Guangxi and Yunnan, and retreat to establish a propped up government in South China.</p>
<p>Our army's active military progress in counterattacking Guangzhou is the main way to combat the South China [Guangdong] Army's increased disturbances. However, if we want this counterattack to be truly effective, it depends not only on the improvement of the combat effectiveness of the frontline troops, but also on the general mobilization of the strength of the people in Xiang, Gan, Min, Yue, and Gui, and the general launch of the war in the entire Guangdong war zone and the guerrilla warfare behind the lines [enemy lines]. Here, we must pray for the government's efforts to improve politics and improve people's livelihoods. Here, we must also pray for the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese from all over the world and their enthusiastic return to serve the country.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Anti-Aggression Bloc</h3>
<p>Recently, the South China × army has been expanding its disturbances, and in the near future, the scope of these disturbances may expand further, and the situation may become more serious. In particular, Japan forcibly occupied Hainan Island, forcibly occupied the Xisha Islands, and recently forcibly occupied the Nansha Islands, ×××××××××××××××××××××××××. Once the Japanese aggressors obtain some exaggerated "victories" in South China, the outbreak of a major disaster in the Far East will definitely not be a matter of long delay!</p>
<p>This situation is naturally made more serious by the current Italian occupation of Albania and Germany's continued new offensives.</p>
<p>Today's newspaper reported news from Tokyo that the British Governor of the Straits Settlements, Thomas, recently visited the Soviet Union, signed a non-aggression pact with the Siamese government, and also said that Vietnam's attitude towards Shanghai has also become more friendly. Britain and France already have a tendency to actively organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression bloc. Although this news is inevitably a sign of Tokyo's nervousness, it is indeed the only way to save the Far Eastern crisis that the Japanese aggressors fear most. China, which is bravely resisting the war, naturally welcomes this anti-aggression bloc movement and is optimistic about its success. However, the most important thing is to first ensure that China occupies a very important equal position, and secondly, to have the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States. Otherwise, Britain and France's collaborative warnings will neither take effect in Europe, nor will they turn into guns and cannons when moved to the Far East! And to deal with the Japanese aggressors, not only warnings are needed, but only guns and cannons are needed, guns and cannons suitable for use by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, surrounding Japan.</p>
<h3>The Inevitable Defeat of Germany and Italy (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>However, the people of Italy and Germany, don't underestimate others too much. In fact, the navy under the union of Britain and France is enough to look down upon the whole world. Whether it is the Far East or the Near East; Central Asia or Asia Minor, the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, even the South African shipping lanes, India and Persia, as well as the territorial waters of Britain and France, are almost completely under the control of their navy.</p>
<p>As long as the British and French navies can maintain a steady supply of food for the British and French people and raw materials for industrial manufacturing, continuously transported from the Americas, self-governing territories, Africa, and India; then, Britain and France are simply impeccable. If there is anything, it is only the problem of aerial threats.</p>
<p>The French may have to withdraw from Savoy, and may even lose Tunisia and Nice, and may not even be able to keep Corsica. Italy and Germany may divide Switzerland, seize Holland, Belgium, Denmark, and North African territories; dominate Spain, and even gallop to the distant Near East and Turkish government, becoming the masters of governance and economy in this new world, but all of this cannot allow Italy and Germany to achieve a quick victory and a quick decision as they wish.</p>
<p>The war will still have to continue, until London and Paris, or Milan and Munich, are left without a single brick or tile, before it can be considered over. As long as the eighty-seven million people of Britain and France and the troops recruited overseas can hold on to the land front of their country and maintain continuous supplies, and the navy can blockade the Axis powers—the western theater of war—the Bosphorus, the Black Sea, and the Soviet territory—no matter how barbaric and cruel the Axis powers fight this war, it will be in vain. The Axis powers will definitely not win.</p>
<p>They cannot win because they cannot obtain a decisive victory at all. It will become a war of attrition. In this way, all the war preparations they have completed at high speed and high cost will inevitably collapse more easily than the preparations of democratic countries, which are step-by-step and lower in cost. Then, just wait and see Hitler and Mussolini shout themselves hoarse!</p>
<p>This is the main reason why Germany and Italy are always afraid of the outbreak of a real war. They themselves understand very well that they can easily gain the upper hand in peaceful negotiations. A series of facts in recent years, up to the Munich Agreement, have shown that they have been rising step by step and taking advantage of every opportunity. But if the threat of war really opens up war, everything will be over, the dream of victory will surely be shattered; what remains is a dead end.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that if a second European war really breaks out, the Axis powers are bound to be defeated.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can also know that the Axis powers are fundamentally afraid of war. As long as the democratic countries no longer muddle along and take on the burden of striking the attackers, the atrocities of the Axis powers will definitely be restrained.</p>

<h3>Pirates Roam the Sea: Two Cargo Boats Robbed in British Waters; One Boat Companion Tragically Wounded by Random Gunfire; One Boat Companion Missing, Suspected of Being Abducted</h3>
<p>Recently, banditry has become increasingly rampant. Two more cases of Siamese bandits robbing boats and shooting crew members have occurred in Hong Kong waters. It has been confirmed that Cargo Boat No. 2219, registered in Hong Kong, with boat owner Lin Guangzhang, 56 years old, was transporting goods such as carrots and onions from Chenghai to Hong Kong on the 9th of this month. There were twelve crew members and eight passengers on board. At 5 pm on the 10th, while passing through the Lam Tong Mei waters, they suddenly saw a boat carrying fifteen bandits coming towards them. They fired more than twenty shots to intimidate them and ordered them to stop. After docking nearby, the bandits swarmed onto the boat, moved the cargo to the bandit boat, and left swaggeringly. The people on the cargo boat saw the bandit boat go far away and continued sailing to Hong Kong to report the case to the police station. It was found that the loss was about 150 yuan. Boat companion Lin Hong was shot and wounded by the bandits in the random gunfire and has been sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury is not fatal and is expected to survive. In addition, boat owner Jiang Wei, 38 years old, of a cargo boat with no license number, went to the Hong Kong Marine Police Station yesterday afternoon to report that at 3:30 pm on the 8th of this month, in the Shen Wan waters between Shen Wan and Longgutan in British territorial waters, while he was carrying cargo and leaving Hong Kong, a boat suddenly came towards him. There were six people on the boat, all carrying long guns and Mauser rifles and other dangerous weapons. They swarmed onto the boat, moved 18 dan of onions and 22 dan of sweet potatoes to the bandit boat, and thoroughly searched the boat before leaving leisurely. At the same time, it was discovered that a boat companion, Yin Xing, 50 years old), a native of Xixiang, Baoan, was suddenly missing and must have been abducted by the bandits. During the past week, the atmosphere in Hong Kong suddenly became cold, and the low temperature was rarely seen since Hong Kong had meteorological records.</p>
<h3>The Weather is Gradually Warming, the Temperature is Rising, and the Humidity is Also Increasing</h3>
<p>During the festive season, it has become warmer again. The highest temperature the day before yesterday reached 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest temperature also reached 66 degrees. At 10 am yesterday morning, the temperature reached a high of 72 degrees, and the highest temperature yesterday even reached 75 degrees. The humidity also simultaneously increased to 73 degrees. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's forecast, this warm weather will continue.</p>
<h3>The Case of Air Force Huang Hanwen's Death After Surgery: Proven to Be Caused by an Overdose of Mongolian Medicine; Doctor Left Hong Kong, Postponement Indefinite</h3>
<p>Huang Hanwen, 28 years old, a member of our Air Force, was injured in battle a month ago and came to Hong Kong to undergo surgery at the Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital in Happy Valley. He died on March 20. The doctor in charge of the surgery was Pan Xihua, the assistant was Sun Runkun, and the doctor who administered the Mongolian medicine was Dr. Ouyang. After the incident, Magistrate Fuller of the Central Magistracy once opened a court to investigate. At 2:30 pm yesterday, the court continued to examine the corpse. Dr. Pan Xihua took the stand to continue providing evidence, followed by Dr. Crowa Wales, who testified about the examination of the corpse, stating that at 9 am on March 23, he examined the body of the deceased Huang Hanwen. The cause of death was due to excessive Mongolian medicine. Not only was the breath of Mongolian medicine detected in various internal organs, but also the blood vessels. It was impossible to prove how much Mongolian medicine the deceased received. Lawyers Shi Yulin, Qi Xibing both cross-examined the witness briefly. Then, a German detective took the stand and testified that the deceased died on March 20. Between the 20th and the 28th, he went to the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Aviation Commission and Wanchai Road to visit Dr. Ouyang, who administered the Mongolian medicine. According to his family, Dr. Ouyang had left Hong Kong for Macau and had not returned as of yesterday. After the German detective finished testifying, the magistrate declared that the case was postponed indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Indian Soldiers on Hunger Strike in Protest Due to Dissatisfaction with Officer's Punishment</h3>
<p>According to the Hong Kong newspaper, the Hong Kong Telegraph, last Friday, a conflict occurred between British and Indian soldiers in the 8th Regiment of Heavy Artillery. One of them was injured in the arm by a knife. The officer in charge placed the four Indian soldiers under custody. Subsequently, eleven more Indian soldiers expressed sympathy and voluntarily requested to be detained together. The fifteen Indian soldiers were punished by the responsible authorities and were reportedly detained in the fortress detention center on Mount Davis. They all went on a hunger strike to show their resistance, but soon gave up. It is said that the conflict was due to racial differences.</p>
<h3>A Man Seriously Injured in Wanchai Johnston Road After Being Beaten by Thugs; Skull Fractured, Life in Danger; One Suspect Arrested and Under Investigation</h3>
<p>At 11:30 am yesterday, in front of No. 122 Johnston Road, Wanchai, in front of the Lady Duchess of Bedford Child Health Centre, a man, about 30 years old, wearing black shirt and pants, was suddenly beaten by a group of thugs. Punches and kicks were exchanged, and one of them held a short stick and struck the man hard. His skull was fractured on the spot, blood gushed out, and his clothes were soaked. He was a bloodied man who lost consciousness and fell to the ground, unable to rise. The thugs did not let go and continued to beat him severely. The injured man turned and moaned miserably. Nearby residents, seeing the situation, feared that a murder would occur, so they whistled to alert the police. At that time, an Indian police officer and a Chinese detective were passing by and heard the news. They rushed forward to investigate and saw the injured man lying on the ground, blood splattered everywhere. They also saw a group of thugs still swarming and beating him. They immediately arrested one of them, while the others fled in disarray towards Tai Yuen Street and Spring Garden Lane, disappearing without a trace. They failed to catch them. Because the injured man was seriously injured, they reported the case to the police station on the one hand, and immediately called the Wanchai Fire Station to send a Red Cross vehicle to bandage the injured man and take him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. At that time, the injured man was completely unconscious. It was impossible to say how he was beaten by the group of people. The police detective took the suspect who was arrested on the spot back to the police station for detention and investigation. The man gave his name as Lau Mau and vehemently denied committing the crime. After the injured man was admitted to the hospital, he remained unconscious after the doctor tried various treatments. Therefore, his name and address were also unclear. Because the occipital bone of his skull was fractured, the situation was very dangerous, and there was a risk to his life.</p>
<h3>Increasing Number of Refugees Coming to Hong Kong from Mainland China; Hong Kong Government Plans to Build More Refugee Camps for Accommodation; Locations are Being Sought, and Several New Camps Will Be Built; Training Refugees for Production Work to Enable Them to Support Themselves</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in South China, tens of thousands of people from various parts of Guangdong Province have fled to Hong Kong. Apart from a small number who are able to support themselves, the majority are displaced and destitute. The Hong Kong government, based on the principles of disaster relief and good neighborliness, is actively seeking ways to accommodate and assist them. The accommodation locations that have been completed include several refugee camps in Kam Tin, Ma Tau Chung, and North Point, accommodating a total of about tens of thousands of refugees. They are provided with food, clothing, housing, and residence. In addition to gradually repatriating them, statistics show that there are still about 10,000 refugees in each camp. However, the war in South China continues to expand. The refugees who have already come to Hong Kong are difficult to repatriate to their original homes, and new refugees continue to arrive in a steady stream. All refugee camps are overcrowded. It is reported that the Hong Kong government is planning to increase the number of refugee camps to fundamentally assist these refugees. Suitable locations are now being sought in order to plan the construction. In the future, when the new camps are completed, new refugees can be sent in for accommodation in a steady stream, so that they will not be displaced. The Hong Kong government's steps for assisting refugees are to first concentrate on accommodation and provide them with living necessities. If the environment permits, it will consider the situation in their hometowns and decide whether to repatriate them. However, many refugees' hometowns have been destroyed by × fires and artillery fire. Their fields and properties have been completely lost, and they cannot make a living even if they return home. Therefore, the authorities will provide them with various work skills and provide them with opportunities to learn crafts so that they can support themselves. The Kam Tin refugee camp has already started to implement work-for-relief measures. The refugees in the camp produce a wide variety of daily necessities, and the results are good. In the future, the authorities will implement industrial training for refugees in other camps so that they can support themselves and not become lazy refugees.</p>

<h3>Comforting Wounded Air Force Soldiers: Another Living Testament to the Inevitable Victory of the Resistance</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Visiting Wounded Air Force Soldiers</p>
<p>How delighted I am! We have the opportunity to comfort the wounded air force soldiers who once took to the skies to vent the frustrations of our 450 million compatriots and to fight for the "national dignity" of the entire Republic of China. Yesterday afternoon, in the gentle warmth of the sun, I, as a reporter, along with a dozen enthusiastic friends from the Amateur Social Club, carrying sincere hearts, went to the ×× Hospital, the recuperation place for our wounded air force soldiers, to express our regards.</p>
<p>As we stepped through the hospital gates, we were eager to be in the presence of our air force heroes, to shake the hands that once struck at the *Japanese*. In front of the room of soldier Huang Changlin, we gently knocked on the door. Mr. Huang Changlin, a man of strong build, with solid muscles, and his wounded left arm swollen like a large ball, walked with a slight limp and greeted us in his pajamas. After we explained our purpose, he happily invited two other wounded air force comrades from the next room to meet us. They were both vigorous and lively young men. One hopped in with a smile, using a wooden crutch, while the right eye of the other was still wrapped in medicated cotton. The youngest of the three was still wearing the cap of the aviation school. Upon seeing us, he raised his hand in salute, and we quickly bowed and shook their hands, expressing our deepest respect. We presented the beautiful fresh flowers, domestic fruits, books, and newspapers we had brought with devotion to these three lovable and admirable air force soldiers after delivering our words of comfort.</p>
<p>After some modest and polite words, they proceeded to tell us about their experiences in the war of resistance and the bright future of our air force, filling us with immense inspiration and joy.</p>
<p>Winning Battles Even When Outnumbered</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Changlin, a native of Guangxi, is the deputy captain of the × squadron of the ×th Air Force Group. He is highly knowledgeable and experienced, having served as an instructor and piloted new Soviet aircraft. He was wounded after striking *Japanese* aircraft in Hengyang. Wei Tang, who was wounded in the right eye, and Xu Linghan, who was wounded in the foot, are both natives of Zhejiang and were classmates and comrades in the same squadron. They are all highly skilled young air force soldiers. After dealing a heavy blow to *Japanese* aircraft, Wei was wounded in Zhijiang, and Xu was wounded in Kunming. It is said that when the number of Chinese and *Japanese* aircraft is equal, we can utterly defeat the *Japanese* aircraft. If the number of Chinese aircraft is half that of the *Japanese* aircraft, we can still win. Even if the number of Chinese aircraft is only one-third of the *Japanese* aircraft, we can still put up a strong fight. The great victory of the air force in Wuhan is a testament to this. The three of them were all wounded in battles where they were outnumbered, but they still managed to win and inflict maximum damage, only being forced to land due to their fearless efforts. For example, in the battle where Wei was wounded, he fought with eight Chinese aircraft against fifteen *Japanese* aircraft and shot down four of them. Wei was hit by bullets all over his body and remained unconscious for thirty-four days before regaining consciousness. He was transported to Chongqing by transport plane and later ordered to fly to Hong Kong for treatment. The experiences of Huang and Xu in getting wounded are also praiseworthy chapters in the history of the bloody resistance against *Japan*.</p>
<p>The Wishes of the Three Air Force Soldiers for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Shortage of Aircraft Is the Main Weakness</p>
<p>When we heard that "after we shot down *Japanese* aircraft, suddenly dozens more *Japanese* aircraft surrounded us. After desperately fighting against them, we had to inform the other aircraft by radio and land because of the damage to the aircraft and injuries to ourselves. Our injuries were originally unnecessary, all because of the shortage of aircraft," we were filled with awe. We further asked how they could still win even when the number of Chinese aircraft was half that of the *Japanese* aircraft. According to the three of them, our new aircraft are indeed very powerful, but the *Japanese* aircraft, which have been prepared for aggression for a long time, should not be underestimated either. Overcoming the *Japanese* and defeating *Japanese* aircraft completely depends on mental strength.</p>
<p>Mental Strength Overcoming Material Strength</p>
<p>Their school motto is: 'Our bodies, aircraft, and bombs are prepared to perish together with the *Japanese* warships and positions!' Every one of our brave air force soldiers is a practitioner of this school motto. They prioritize the nation and the people above all personal concerns. If their mental state is not good, the aviation authorities allow them to take leave without any coercion. They are meant to take to the skies with the determination to defeat ten enemies with one. What especially moved us was: 'When we are in the most dangerous situation, we deliberately steer our aircraft to collide with the *Japanese* aircraft, so that we perish together! However, the *Japanese* pilots have seen through us! Many air force units have had similar experiences. When our aircraft approaches their aircraft and is about to collide, they immediately evade and flee!' — A road is forged where there is no road, and life comes from the determination to die. Here, we have another living testament. In that case, it seems that the spirit of *Japanese* pilots is much inferior to that of our air force. The three of them answered in unison: 'That's for sure! Apart from following orders, they are actually tired of war. Apart from following orders, each of us believes that we must fight to the death for the survival of the nation and the people.' Truly, this is the great and glorious new air force of the new China.</p>
<p>International Sympathy and Assistance</p>
<p>The three of them, especially the talkative Wei, eloquently told us about how the Chinese air force flew to Japan, how the air force achieved such amazing results in shooting down *Japanese* aircraft in Wuhan, a series of technical terms, and the horsepower and combat methods of various aircraft. In response to our inquiries, they also said: 'The pilots and material assistance of the International Volunteer Group are also very inspiring to us. Especially the Soviet pilots, who are often with us. They are very close, and they all believe that China's war of resistance is also fought for the universal principles of justice and righteousness.'</p>
<p>The Glorious Future of the New Chinese Air Force</p>
<p>'As for our new air force, a large number of new aircraft will soon be built up.' Captain Huang also said very responsibly: 'Every one of our air force members is dedicated to the country. The new Chinese air force definitely has a bright future. This is enough to reassure the people of the country.' We were truly inspired to the extreme.</p>
<p>After talking for a full two hours, deeply moved, the ladies who accompanied us sang two songs, 'Comforting the Wounded Soldiers' and 'China Will Not Perish'. Then, with reluctance, we shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<p>'China will not perish! China will not perish!…' On the way back, we were still singing this.</p>

<h3>*Japanese* Landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk; Failed to Invade Nantou; Fierce Fighting Ensued; One Chinese Policeman Died; Shenzhen Remained Peaceful; Shekou Customs Evacuated to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express] More than two hundred *Japanese* soldiers invaded Nantou for the third time yesterday morning. The *Japanese* landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk and raided the county seat. Our guerrillas fiercely resisted in the suburbs of Nantou. Both sides exchanged machine gun fire, and the fighting was quite fierce. Only one policeman on our side was killed and several were seriously injured. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>*Japanese* Troops Invade Nantou Again by Two Routes</p>
<p>Nantou in Baoan County had previously fallen twice. The *Japanese* soldiers usually deployed cavalry and passed through Taiping, Guangji Market, and Shajing, or advanced from Huanggang. Therefore, our side had already received intelligence from along the way before the *Japanese* soldiers arrived. However, this time, they changed their approach and attacked by water. At three o'clock yesterday morning, taking advantage of the darkness, they took more than twenty large and small fishing boats, escorted by *Japanese* warships, and arrived at the sea off Chiwan via the Lingdingyang. Some landed at Chiwan, and some landed at Chan Uk. As dawn broke, they advanced towards Nantou in two routes.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Results in *Japanese* Failure</p>
<p>After receiving an urgent report from the outposts, Chi Zhongkuan, Commander of the East River South Bank Command, and Luo Fengxiang, Commander of the Third Guerrilla Column, immediately ordered the Fourth Guerrilla Brigade to ambush in the suburbs of Nantou, preparing to launch a surprise attack. After nine o'clock, fierce fighting broke out between the *Japanese* and us. The *Japanese* fired wildly with machine guns, and we, hiding in concealed places, retaliated with machine guns. Only one policeman on our side died and several were injured. Finally, the *Japanese* were repelled. Chief Commander Chi Zhongkuan and Commander Luo Fengxiang, Commander Wang Ruozhou, and others have now dispatched guerrilla teams from all routes to reinforce the area to prevent the *Japanese* from invading again.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Remains Quiet; *Japanese* Aircraft Reconnaiter</p>
<p>After the news of the *Japanese* invasion of Nantou reached Shenzhen, the people remained calm. A *Japanese* aircraft flew over Shenzhen once at noon for reconnaissance purposes. It did not drop any bombs yesterday. After learning that the *Japanese* had landed in Chiwan and Chan Uk, the Shenzhen police immediately took strict precautions and dispatched additional police officers to patrol. The *Japanese* who landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk were very close to Shekou. At the time of the landing, the *Japanese* threatened to sweep Shekou. Therefore, the customs officials in Shekou immediately evacuated. At around 11:00 AM, the Baoan ferry returned to Hong Kong, and the smuggled goods were also transported back to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>*Japanese* Intention Is to Obstruct Our Teams</p>
<p>According to general opinion, the *Japanese* army's invasion of Nantou was not intended to disturb the New Territories. Their main goal in occupying the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was to drive out the Chinese guerrillas operating along the Shilong and Zhangmutou lines. According to Chinese military sources, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chinese troops stationed in Baoan, along with the Guerrilla Study Team, engaged in fierce fighting with the landed *Japanese* troops between Shenzhen and Nantou. The Baoan military authorities are now stepping up their defenses to block the *Japanese* from invading.</p>
<p>Another Message Says Fighting Still Taking Place in Taiping</p>
<p>Another message states that at 3:10 PM yesterday, the Baoan ferry arrived in Hong Kong from Baoan. According to passengers who spoke to reporters, there was no fighting in the Nantou area. However, from a distance, flames could be seen raging in Taiping, and the fire was very intense, presumably caused by the *Japanese* army setting fire to local fishing villages. According to what they knew, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, about two to three hundred *Japanese* soldiers, aboard several armed fishing boats, approached the shore of Nantou. The *Japanese* soldiers landed continuously and then boarded more than a dozen cars and drove into Nantou City. This time, the *Japanese* re-invaded, presumably to reinforce the defenses. After the *Japanese* soldiers landed, the *Japanese* armed fishing boats sailed out towards Lingdingyang one after another between 8:00 and 9:00 AM yesterday morning. It is also heard that the Baoan ferry will continue to operate this morning, carrying passengers and goods as usual. Traffic between Hong Kong and Baoan is not currently interrupted.</p>
<h3>Our Guerrilla Forces Achieve Victories in the Nanshun Area; *Japanese* Transportation Is Constantly Attacked by Us; Guangsan Railway Train Bombed, Killing More Than 200 *Japanese*</h3>
<p>(Nanhai Express) The *Japanese* army in Ronggui and Daliang, Shunde, has recently been supporting the Xinhe front line. Therefore, *Japanese* transportation is frequently seen in the Nanshun border area, and it is extremely busy. It is found that in recent days, the *Japanese* army has been transporting military supplies by water and land from Foshan to Daliang and Southwest to supply the *Japanese* troops. There have been several attacks on the way by our guerrillas, which are listed below: (1) On the 2nd of this month, the *Japanese* Katano Artillery Regiment sent more than 60 *Japanese* soldiers with six small steam boats, loaded with food and bullets, from Pingzhou to Daliang. At 4:00 PM, when they arrived at the river between Macun and Dadu in Shunde, they were detected by the Longwei unit of our guerrilla detachment. They gathered more than one hundred members of the guerrilla team and ambushed on both banks of Dadu. When the *Japanese* passed by, they suddenly fired machine guns at the *Japanese*. The *Japanese* were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. In this battle, three *Japanese* steam boats were sunk, and more than ten *Japanese* soldiers were drowned. Sergeant Okamoto Noichi of the *Japanese* Katano Artillery Regiment was also killed. (2) On the 4th of this month, the *Japanese* Ashidachi unit stationed in Lanshi sent three or forty *Japanese* soldiers to transport six large carts of fodder, canned food, and dry rations along the Shunde-Foshan Highway. When they arrived at the intersection of Xiaobu and Shuiteng, they were discovered by our Nanhai guerrilla team. They dispersed and occupied the nearby high ground and dangerous terrain and threw hand grenades at the *Japanese*. Our guerrillas were exceptionally brave and charged forward fearlessly, engaging in close combat with the *Japanese* for about 30 minutes. The *Japanese* were overwhelmed and retreated towards Lanshi. In this battle, our guerrillas destroyed two *Japanese* transport vehicles, captured one vehicle, with about eighty bags of rice. The remaining three vehicles escaped and retreated, and more than twenty mules and horses were killed. Eleven *Japanese* soldiers were killed, and five or six guerrillas also died heroically. (3) At 10:00 PM on the night of the 5th of this month, a *Japanese* military train of six cars was traveling from Foshan Station along the Guangsan Railway to Southwest. When it approached Luocun Station, it detonated a landmine planted by our guerrilla team. There was a loud explosion, and flames shot into the sky. Two *Japanese* military cars were destroyed on the spot, and more than two hundred *Japanese* soldiers were killed. The other cars were also unable to move. The *Japanese* soldiers retreated to Foshan in a panic. Our guerrillas are now very active from Luocun to Nange stations. The Guangsan Railway has been suspended since the 6th.</p>
<h3>*Japanese* Harass Our Coastal Areas; Fujian Prepares for Wartime Measures; We Are Determined to Defend the Great Fujian; Coastal Residents Move Inland to Reclaim Wasteland</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou Express) Since occupying Amoy and Kinmen Islands, the *Japanese* have been actively building them into bases for sea and air landings to invade Fujian, in order to control Fujian Province and echo the *Japanese* on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They also frequently send warships and aircraft to harass the coastal areas, attempting to land. An officer of our unit saw this early and secretly went to Chongqing last month to request instructions from the highest authorities. After detailed discussions at a military meeting, a complete plan to defend Great Fujian has been formulated to crush the *Japanese* plot. In addition to strengthening the existing militia in various places and drafting able-bodied men into the army, several newly established coastal defense heavy artillery teams and mechanized teams have been transferred from a certain department of the Central Government to be on strict alert. Military experts from a certain country were hired to design coastal defense lines along the Fujian coast, assessing the terrain. The work will soon be completed. Therefore, the *Japanese* attempts to send troops to land have been unsuccessful, and their warships have been heavily damaged by our artillery teams. Recently, our authorities have designated the coastal areas as war zones. In order to ensure the safety of the residents of these areas, they should be relocated to safe areas in advance to avoid the tragedy of fleeing in panic. A decree has been issued to limit coastal residents to prepare to move to the counties of Northwest, Jiliu, Chong'an, Ningyang, Taishun, Dehua, Jianyang, Yong'an, Ningwu, Jiangle, Shunchang, and Mingxi as reclamation areas. Reclamation offices will be established, with the county magistrates of those counties serving concurrently as directors, and deputy directors will be appointed by the Provincial Relief Association. Travel expenses and accommodation for each immigrant family will be temporarily provided by the reclamation offices. Each family will be allocated tens of dollars to purchase agricultural tools and build thatched huts for working in designated fields. In addition to a subsidy of 150,000 yuan from the Central Relief Association, the remainder of the funds will be provided by the Fujian Provincial Government. Fuqing County, which was frequently bombed by *Japanese* aircraft in the past, has also suffered from a drought this spring. There has been no rain since the beginning of spring, and many residents have moved to Chongqing in an orderly manner. Other counties will continue to relocate immigrants and prepare for scorched-earth resistance.</p>
<h3>Fourth War Area Promulgates Measures to Reward Capture of *Japanese* Soldiers; 60 Yuan Awarded for Each *Japanese* Soldier Captured; 120 Yuan Awarded for Each *Japanese* Officer Captured</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Express) Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Area, in order to encourage the anti-*Japanese* sentiment of the front-line soldiers and civilians and the spirit of charging into battle, has ordered that for the capture of *Japanese* soldiers by combat troops, guerrilla forces, and civilians, in addition to following the "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding the Capture of *Japanese* and Puppet Officers and Soldiers" formulated by the Military Affairs Commission, meritorious service will be recorded or promotions will be given based on the circumstances. He also issued a notice yesterday to the commanders of various defense forces and guerrilla commanders to inform their subordinates that a reward of 60 yuan will be given for each *Japanese* soldier captured and 120 yuan for each *Japanese* officer captured, in order to encourage them. However, if those captured are compatriots from Northeast China or Korea, they must not be killed or humiliated. Even *Japanese* captives should be treated well and persuaded to surrender by methods that will move them, in order to demonstrate the generosity and benevolence of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>*Japanese* Strengthen Outer Defense Line and Rush to Build Huangpu Port; Guangdong Guerrillas Determined to Crush *Japanese* Plot</h3>
<p>(Shamian Express) Our armies from the East, West, North, and Sichuan are counterattacking the *Japanese* and making great gains, inflicting heavy blows on the *Japanese*. At present, the various armies are continuing to advance toward Guangzhou to wipe out the Guangdong *Japanese*. It is found that the *Japanese* chieftain Ando has been very busy lately but is unable to cope. According to intelligence here, the so-called commander of the South China Expeditionary Army, Ando, in order to protect Guangzhou, has strengthened the outer defense line of Fuzhou, enforced forced labor, and set a deadline of one month to complete the Huangpu military port area, so as to serve as a base for the outer defense line of the sea, land, and air. Recently, in order to prevent attacks by our air force, they have added night shifts. It is estimated that more than 5,000 people in the occupied areas have been forcibly recruited. The *Japanese* army forces them to supervise the work every night. However, our guerrilla forces have repeatedly tried to crush the *Japanese* conspiracy and plan and have launched several sneak attacks. However, the *Japanese* army is heavily guarded in the Huangpu area. Therefore, our guerrilla forces have decided to change their strategy and obstruct the progress of the *Japanese* construction. Therefore, there are occasional small encounters near Huangpu, and the port construction project has also been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Our Forces Launch a General Offensive on Huaxian Overnight and Recapture It; The "Emperor's Army of Jiangtou" Collapses and Flees in Panic; Driving the *Japanese* South of Xinjie</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Wengyuan, 11th) A certain regiment of the 12th Army Group launched a fierce attack on Huaxian on the night of the 8th. After a night of fierce fighting, as dawn approached, our reinforcements continued to join the attack. The *Japanese* were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed and fled in panic. Our army recaptured the county seat. In this battle, hundreds of *Japanese* were killed, and countless military supplies were captured. An inventory is currently underway. The corpses of *Japanese* soldiers were found all over the suburbs of the city. Among the *Japanese* corpses, the unit numbers of Watanabe and Fujii were found, which were officially called the "Emperor's Army of Jiangtou". When our troops entered the city in the morning of the 9th, the people returned from the mountains and cheered along the way, helping us transport the spoils of war.</p>
<p>A delayed message states that stubborn *Japanese* troops attempted to advance towards Aotou from Maigan on the 7th and 8th, but were severely attacked by us and suffered heavy casualties. After fleeing in panic, another unit of about 2,000 troops attacked north from Huaxian but were lured into the mountains and valleys and counterattacked in one fell swoop. The *Japanese* were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, abandoning military supplies, suffering casualties, and fleeing. We captured many guns, documents, and horses. The Watanabe, Ijiri, and Koga units fought against us in this battle. We took advantage of the victory to pursue the *Japanese* and drove them south of Xinjie.</p>
<h3>Twenty Thousand *Dan* of Jiangxi Rice Transported to Xinpu, Chaoshan-Meixian Rice Panic Resolved; People's Food Supply Can Be Assured; Measures for Refugees Determined</h3>
<p>[Xingning Quick News] Regarding the matter of relieving the rice panic in Chaoshan-Meixian and its affiliated areas, since Tan Baoshou, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, telegraphed the provincial government, Chairman Li negotiated with the Agricultural Credit Bureau and the Jiangxi provincial authorities to jointly purchase surplus rice from Jiangxi Province and transport it to Chaoshan for regulation. The current rice panic in Chaoshan has been resolved. According to the person in charge of the Sixth District Commissioner's Office, the amount of Jiangxi rice transported to Chaoshan is expected to be at least 200,000 *dan*. Transportation points have been set up in Gan'nan Menling, Xinpu, Meixian, Songkou, Dabu, Chaoshan, and other places. It is understood that the first batch of this white rice has been transported to Xinpu and Meixian by vehicles from the Xijiang Trade Department and will soon begin to stabilize prices. Therefore, the rice market has gradually stabilized, and the people's food supply can be assured. In addition, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office, considering that the counties in this district are close to the war zone, and if a major war breaks out, it is difficult to guarantee that a large number of refugees will not enter the area, has specially formulated measures for the Sixth District counties to provide relief to refugees and ordered them to be followed. The contents of the measures are: (1) Evacuation routes for refugees and safe areas to reach; (2) Inspection, management, and transportation of refugees; (3) Old and young women transported by boats and vehicles, the rest walking; (4) After the refugees arrive at the designated location, they must be organized into agricultural, industrial, commercial, women, children, elderly, and weak teams, in order to find ways to accommodate them or allocate work; (5) The refugees' rations will be provided by the organizing agency at a rate of two *jiao* per person per day for food; (6) Each county must establish refugee granaries; (7) After the refugees arrive, they must be introduced to jobs or provided with loans to start small businesses or cultivate land; (8) Refugee handicraft workshops and refugee cultivation areas must be established; (9) Refugee medical clinics and maternity hospitals for refugee women must be established; (10) Refugee education classes must be established to accommodate out-of-school children or send refugee children to various schools for temporary study. As for the refugee relief funds, the provincial government has successively allocated more than 30,000 yuan to the Sixth District Commissioner's Office. Apart from the several thousand yuan that have been distributed to various counties, there are still about 30,000 yuan remaining in the office.</p>

<h3>Encirclement of Guangzhou Taking Shape; Northern Route Our Troops Repeatedly Seize Key Points; Guangzhou × Military Strength Very Weak; Situation in Taicheng and Guanghai Gradually Tightening</h3>
<p>[Macau Special Dispatch] Since our general counter-offensive order was issued, the armies of all routes have actively attacked the outer perimeter of Guangzhou, especially the northern route. It has been the most intense. The northern route is where our main force is located. Since the counter-offensive, we have captured many important strongholds in succession. Now the army is heading straight for Guangzhou, and the × chief is extremely anxious. Most of the × along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road have been transferred to Jiangmen and Xinhui, resulting in weak Guangzhou military strength. In order to hold Guangzhou and plan for the final stand, they have to transfer a part of the × who invaded Xinhui back. The rest are still trying hard to hold on in various places. Therefore, the battles on the various routes of the West River have been extremely fierce in recent days.</p>
<p>Situation in Taicheng and Guanghai</p>
<p>In the past ten days, × warships have gathered on the waters around Haiyan, Guanghai, and Taicheng, constantly firing artillery at our defense lines.

However, our army held on with the determination to fight, advancing wave after wave. Currently, they are still in a stalemate near the northeast of Jiangmen and Xinhui.</p>
<h3>Movies and Theater; Shanghai Film People in Sichuan; Clothing is the Object of Imitation by Sichuanese</h3>
<p>A large group of movie artists, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan a few years ago, organized under the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe" and, with their past fame on the screen, embarked on a long march into Sichuan to perform patriotic dramas. At the time, they caused a great sensation in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places, receiving a grand welcome from the audience. At the same time, in terms of patriotic work, it was also a powerful propaganda with great effect. They stayed in Chengdu the longest, and there are still many people giving long-term performances. At first, when they first arrived there, many young men and women in the local area followed this large group of cutting-edge figures step by step, imitating everything. Especially in terms of clothing, it caused quite a few interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>Barefoot Leather Shoes Bai Yang, Liu Liying, and other female stars, at that time, because the autumn heat had not yet subsided, many people still showed their seductive jade ankles, wearing barefoot leather shoes without socks. The women of Chongqing started a new fashion for this industry, taking off their socks one after another, claiming to be fashionable, and even going further. Some modern women wearing ordinary shoes also did not wear socks, which quickly formed a temporary fashion.</p>
<p>Pom-pom Hat A kind of woolen hat with a large pom-pom on top, which some male actors originally used as nightcaps in the guest house. One day, someone came off stage after acting and accidentally wore this hat to the theater a few times. Many young viewers thought it was a new style popular in Shanghai. In a few days, people in Chengdu competed to imitate it, and it became popular for a while. The young people on the street, coming and going, all wore such a hat, with various colors of red silk, creating a spectacle. Many hat shops in the city also rushed to make them to meet the market demand, and each hat was sold for as much as two or three yuan, still in short supply, which was really a great extra business.</p>
<p>Ribbon Hairtie Bai Yang once went to a photo studio to take a photo. Because she didn't have new clothes, she suddenly had a clever idea and untied a belt from her woolen coat, using it as a ribbon on her head, with the large pom-poms on both ends diagonally adorned. The look was very unique. Later, the photo studio displayed this photo in the glass cabinet on the street, which immediately attracted the attention of many women. Everyone was busy dressing up in the same style, and it became a very popular new "innovation."</p>
<p>Cheongsam Coat Even more laughable was the fact that Shi Chao, Zhuo Manli, and she did not bring her coat. The weather suddenly turned cold in winter, and she was still wearing a thin cheongsam. Shi Chao had no choice but to let her wear one of his coats temporarily to keep warm. Unexpectedly, when the local girls found out, some thought it was also a very new and fashionable outfit, and they all blindly followed suit, not letting Zhuo Manli be the only one to enjoy the beauty.</p>
<p>Such jokes happened quite a lot in Chengdu and Chongqing, which was extremely funny. From this point of view, the propaganda power of those film artists performing patriotic dramas is also a clear proof.</p>
<h3>New Hollywood Movies</h3>

<h3>Which Movie Star is a Famous Photographer?</h3>
<p>Humphrey Bogart, people know that he is a villain on the screen. His vicious and sinister facial expressions can make everyone's emotions suffocated. Everyone admits that he is a talent for villainous performances like Laurie Nolan.</p>
<p>However, who would have thought that he is also a photographer with artistic cultivation behind the scenes? In order to take care of the many audiences who want to appreciate his works, he publicly exhibited his life's achievements in New York. His photographic specialty is to use lenses with angles that are different from the ordinary, and he likes to choose cats of different colors as the object of shooting. Do you know that he already has more than a thousand works of cats alone?</p>
<p>Leslie Howard from England is also a photography fan. He said, "The background for my photos is very simple, just a piano, a fireplace, a rooftop that can be outlined, and a few books placed on the table." If you can't find him on the photography scene, then you only need to go to a few large photo studios, and you will surely see him by the camera.</p>
<p>Clark Gable, who is rough and enthusiastic, is also one who is addicted to photography. Once, he disguised himself as a hunter and used three thousand feet of film to record the entire journey he had traveled during his hunting trip. However, when he came back and washed them, he suddenly found that there was nothing on them. He then remembered that he had forgotten to change the film.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn, in order to take good outdoor scenes, had been to wild places such as Barraco, New Guinea, Australia, and Abyssinia with his wife Lily Damita. He has thousands of photos of the lives of the natives there. His two most valuable photos in his life are a photo of himself and a photo of a king of a certain country, which have won awards.</p>

<h3>Weekend International Football Final; Chinese and Portuguese Squads Both Decided; Strong and Well-Mannered Chinese Team May Win Championship Again</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The international football final is scheduled to be held at the Po Field on the afternoon of the 16th of this month (Sunday) at 4:00 PM. This good show will definitely attract the attention of fans, and this is a charitable act, so it is our inescapable duty to contribute money and effort.</p>
<p>Regarding the course of this competition, Portugal won the right to enter the final after winning one game and eliminating the Irish team. The Chinese team won two games in a row, first defeating the Scottish team and then defeating the English team, thus winning the qualification to compete for the championship. They will compete against the Portuguese team on the 16th.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team initially wanted to give up participating due to a lack of talent. Later, veterans Da Gao You Nu, Xiao Gao Shannu, Remidi, and Biludu agreed to play to support the team, which allowed them to form a team. And as soon as they came out, they defeated the Irish team and won the right to compete for the championship.</p>
<p>Of the six major championships, our Chinese team has already won three. More than half of the remaining ones are also believed to be must-wins for our Chinese team. As it seems, it is possible to take over all the championships. Especially this International English Weekly Cup, which is a must-win, because the gains and losses are related to the dignity of the country.</p>
<p>At present, the Chinese team is full of talent, gathering the elite, how strong, to win glory for the country, and will definitely be of one mind and one heart to complete this great cause.</p>
<p>The East is now touring the south, and the players have not returned, so the players under the South China banner will be the main force. However, even if the East returns, the South China players who are selected will still account for the majority.</p>
<p>The entire lineup was selected yesterday. Of the eleven players, only two with the surname Hou are not South China players. Shao Huitang is also on the list, because this is a charity match, and he has made a decision to play for the sake of charity, so this time we will have to trouble this brother again.</p>
<p>In the past, Guo Yingqi has never participated in any collective selection competition. However, this time he occupies a seat and is appointed as the right midfielder, because he has recently played this position in a decent manner, so he is appreciated by the selection committee and can be named.</p>
<p>The Portuguese squad has also been produced. However, Jin followed the East on a southern tour and could not rush back to respond to this game. Xiao Gao Shannu is also a guest in Xiamen, so this time the Portuguese team's lineup is not as complete as when they first fought the Irish team. Facing a strong Chinese team, this difficult hurdle will not be easy for them to overcome. Let's see if the great championship will again belong to our Chinese team. The squads of the Chinese and Portuguese teams are as follows (Stadium Tyrant):</p>
<p>Great China</p>

<h3>Talking about Tennis</h3>
<p>(1) The Origin of Tennis</p>
<p>All kinds of sports in the world, when they were initiated, gradually evolved from very simple games to a perfect and proper kind of fascination today, occupying a considerable position in the sports world. Such things as football, baseball, and basketball have all developed from this evolutionary method to have what they are today. Tennis, of course, cannot escape such a process.</p>
<p>Examining the origin of tennis, it actually began in England. At the beginning, they simply took a small leather ball and used rackets to hit it, with a net in the middle. There were no specific regulations on rackets, tennis balls, or other court and competition rules. Later, more and more people liked to play tennis, and it gradually improved, resulting in today's perfect result.</p>
<p>(2) Tennis Development Worldwide</p>
<p>Since tennis was founded in England, it has spread all over the world. The first country to flourish was the United States, and the United States has a special way of developing tennis, which is called the American style. Many countries in the world studying tennis also emulate the American method. Australian tennis competitions also have amazing results. Their doubles and singles competitions can overwhelm the British Isles, because although British tennis is the founding country, they have made no progress in the game of tennis. New Zealand's tennis is also progressing rapidly, and it is determined to improve, with great progress every day. Other countries such as Germany, Russia, Sweden, and Norway also have research and effectiveness. In recent years, American tennis games have been continuously researched and improved, and it can be said that they have taken the lead in the tennis world. The International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, often falls into the hands of Americans. Unexpectedly, a dark horse emerged, and French tennis used scientific methods to become the world's champion. The Davis Cup in the past few years has been taken from the hands of Americans by the French, and the game of tennis has aroused enthusiastic competition among people around the world.</p>
<p>(3) The Current Situation of Chinese Tennis</p>
<p>Since China has had tennis games, it has been almost decades. However, there is still little promotion in various places, and there are even fewer in the inland areas. It is not paid much attention to by people, not as popular as football, nor as competitive as basketball, which has risen later. In this sluggish Chinese tennis world, a thunderbolt suddenly shocked people, that is, in the Far East Games in 1927, Chinese tennis players Lin Shihua, Qiu Feihai, and others returned from overseas and actually won the most outstanding championship. Isn't that an honor for the Chinese tennis world? Even Japan and the Philippines were conquered by them. Since then, people in the Chinese sports world have shown a lot of interest in tennis. It is not impossible for it to develop in the future.</p>
<p>(4) What is a Tennis Season?</p>
<p>Football and basketball all have their seasons. This season is when it is most appropriate to compete and practice with that ball, so this time is set as the season for a certain ball. The tennis season is in the summer, because tennis games are not as intense as football, basketball, and other ball games. There is less running in tennis competitions, so it is more appropriate to practice in the morning and evening on hot summer days than other ball games.</p>
<p>(5) The Relationship Between Tennis and Sports</p>
<p>Tennis is a beneficial game in the sports world, and of course, it has a very close relationship with sports. This sentence is unnecessary to say, but we don't know what benefits there are for the body after studying tennis. Here, we might as well talk about it. When we compete in tennis, we must have a brave spirit, a calm attitude, and lively movements. It is not just about using strong strength, because tennis games do not require intense movements like other ball games such as football. What it must have is that the hands and feet must be light, the eyes must be sharp, and the body and mind must have coordinated actions. Although some strength is required when serving and hitting the ball, it is not limitless. Because if the strength used is not controlled, then the distance of the ball will not be appropriate. Even in ordinary times, when practicing tennis, the strength should be moderate so that you can move around the court and advance and retreat properly. Therefore, the benefit of tennis in sports is that the movement is appropriate and just right.</p>
<p>(6) The Relationship Between Tennis and Intellectual Development</p>
<p>The relationship between tennis and sports has already been mentioned above. Now let's talk about the relationship with intellectual development. We know that tennis games are not only beneficial to sports, but also have great benefits to intellectual development. For example, hitting other balls, or when the ball is still, or when the ball is moving on the ground, you can calmly hit it. When it comes to hitting a tennis ball, you must be in the middle of running. Therefore, before hitting, you must think about where the ball is coming from, what the situation is, how it is flying in the air, and how it is landing on the ground. Then, what kind of hitting method should I use to deal with it, and what method can I use to resist the opponent so that I can win? These points must be considered and decided upon in an instant to come up with a strategy to deal with it and win the final victory. According to this, the game of tennis uses intellect to drive physical strength to make appropriate movements at any time and place during the movement. Therefore, lively intellect, agility, and judgment are indispensable in tennis games. That is, we can use this kind of intellect to control the situation on the court.</p>
<h3>South China Swimming Pool Officially Open; Swimming Performances</h3>
<p>The South China Athletic Association Swimming Pool, this year's interior and exterior have been newly decorated, and it is exceptionally beautiful. It is now scheduled to officially open on April 15th. On the afternoon of the same day at 2:00 PM, male and female swimmers will be invited to perform ice skills, and the association's musicians will play music to help celebrate.

<h3>There is a Revival of the Chinese Football Team; Plans to Participate in the League Again Next Year</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Zhonghua Club team, which won the first-division football league championship three times in the past, could not send a team to participate last year due to a lack of talent. Therefore, the name of Zhonghua was no longer seen. It is now heard that a certain enthusiastic person has taken on the mission of reviving Zhonghua and plans to find a way to send a team to participate in the league again in the coming football season. However, what is heard is like this, and it remains to be proven by facts in the future.</p>

<h3>Chinese Players Win All Tennis Matches Yesterday After Hard-Fought Battles, Decided Only After Three Sets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, three matches were held in the All Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles and Doubles Competition. Each match was a hard-fought battle, with each side having to endure three sets before a winner could be determined. In the end, all the winners were Chinese players, adding a touch of glory.</p>
<p>The singles match between Xu Runpei and Crawford was decided only at sunset. Crawford was the runner-up in the hard court tennis competition two years ago. He is full of energy, steady, and resilient. In the first set, Little Xu fought with all his might, taking advantage of his net play to win 6-3. In the second set, Crawford began to play more aggressively, using his right-handed serve to win back a set, tying the score. In the final set, Little Xu calmly countered, taking a 4-1 lead. Crawford fought tirelessly, his face unchanged, and pulled back a game. Little Xu did not dare to be negligent, using both hard and soft tactics, and finally won 6-4, overcoming the difficult challenge. But by this time, Little Xu was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>The doubles match between Li Rurong and He Jialiu against De Fu and Pierce was held at the stand court, with a large number of spectators. In the first set, De Fu and Pierce used their height and long arms to smash the ball powerfully, winning 7-5. In the first game, He and Li learned the opponent's weaknesses, using softness to overcome hardness, and moving the opponent from left to right to win back a set 6-1. In the final game, De Fu was panting heavily and his shots were weak. Pierce could not support himself alone and lost again 6-2.</p>
<p>The match between Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi against Da Gao You Nu and Remy Di was very intense. The two Portuguese players were both good at serving and had powerful long shots, so they were able to win the first set 6-1. Lin and Huang realized the opponent's power and struggled hard. Lin was skilled at net play and had a sharp serve, assisting Huang's fierce attack to win back a set. In the third set, the two Portuguese players made mistakes. Lin and Huang assisted in the attack and won 6-3. The results of yesterday are listed below:</p>

<h3>A Sports Column That Truly Serves Sports</h3>
<p>— Zhuoyue</p>
<p>On the surface, Hong Kong's public sports seem vibrant, with large crowds of spectators watching games. The revenue from ticket sales for each football match is astonishing, rarely seen in the mainland. This enthusiastic audience at ball games can represent the optimistic state of public sports among Hong Kong compatriots. However, upon closer examination, the knowledge and practice of sports among compatriots are very limited. I believe that improving public sports knowledge and promoting public sports, so that compatriots' sports can truly and universally develop, are closely related to all sports organizations. In fact, sports columns in newspapers bear an even greater responsibility. If sports columns in newspapers can truly work for the development of public sports, encouraging the public with the most sincere attitude and methods, so that Hong Kong compatriots can have a basic understanding and appreciation of sports, and realize the importance and necessity of practicing sports, then the level of public sports knowledge among compatriots will naturally improve, and it will be easier to promote or popularize public sports. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the editors of sports columns in newspapers should change their approach in the future, instead of rigidly sticking to the rules and simply reporting the schedule of which team is playing, the results of the game... what the schedule is for tomorrow, etc. They should use more flexible writing to describe sports events and solicit more contributions from sports comrades on sports literature, so that the content of sports columns is enriched, allowing compatriots to directly obtain general sports theories, knowledge, and various exercise methods in the sports column. If this can be done, Hong Kong compatriots' sports undertakings will definitely develop day by day. Among the current newspapers, I believe that only the sports column of Shen Bao can truly serve sports and achieve the effect of promoting public sports. Although it is making this effort, its individual capacity is inevitably limited. Therefore, I specifically offer my personal opinion to those who are enthusiastic about sports, hoping that in the future, sports columns in newspapers should carry more sports theories and knowledge. On the one hand, public sports can be promoted, and on the other hand, our sports comrades can also have the opportunity to learn from each other.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] Mr. Zhuo is a very famous sports teacher at a middle school in Hong Kong. His sports articles are theoretically insightful and practical. This newspaper has published them many times, and they have been well received by readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuo's praise for this column is more than we deserve. However, our purpose is, as Mr. Zhuo said, to popularize sports, so the manuscripts we adopt focus on practical effects, so that readers can know and practice.</p>
<p>However, this type of manuscript is difficult to write without extensive experience in sports. In the past, this column has been honored to receive contributions from Mr. Quan, Mr. Wang Xuezheng, Mr. Dou Falu, and Mr. Luo. The opinions expressed are all suitable for the needs of practical sports. We hope that the gentlemen will continue to help us in the future. This column is fortunate, and public sports are fortunate.</p>
<h3>Sports Briefs</h3>
<p>The public team competition will have two games today according to the schedule, but the Ying Society requested a change of date due to circumstances, so only the Xianhua vs. Queen's College game will be held. This is the first battle of the second week of the cycle. In the first week, Queen's College won all three games and has never lost, ranking first. Yucai won two and lost one in three games, ranking second to Queen's College. In today's game, the Queen's College team is confident of victory. It is also reported that someone has proposed to Bao Dawo, the person in charge of the league, to hold an exhibition game to raise money for refugees after the league ends. Mr. Bao is now contacting and discussing with all parties to carry it out.</p>
<p>The Reporter's Sports Association has scheduled a trip to Da Yu Mountain on the 14th of this month (Friday) at 4:00 AM by boat. The notice has been issued before. It has been found that many people have signed up recently. For the convenience of handling affairs, registration will be closed at 12:00 tonight (12th).

<h3>Turning Three Bays</h3>
<p>— Zimu</p>
<p>"Damn it, no matter how fierce the Japanese devils are, we can catch up with them with this river. We'll capture their warships and bring them back alive!" Zhuan San Wan said to a group of people in the village.</p>
<p>"You're planning to return to Black Stone Rock, haha, haha." The listeners laughed, and hidden in this laughter was a story:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in a certain village, there was a team of dragon boat racing experts. Their dragon boats paddled the fastest. As soon as the signal was given, they would already have turned three bays. Later, in a race, they paddled too enthusiastically. Carelessly, the dragon boat, as before, went straight into a cave on the riverbank named Black Stone Rock, and never came out again.</p>
<p>"One beat, turn three bays, dragon returns to Black Stone Rock" is a ballad sung by the villagers, because Da Niu was also a dragon boat racing expert, so he got the nickname "Turn Three Bays". Everyone knew the story of "Turn Three Bays", and everyone knew that "Turn Three Bays" was Da Niu's nickname.</p>
<p>Since the violent entered our country, the enthusiasm for resistance has been boiling in the hearts of all our people. The consciousness of resistance has penetrated deeply into the inner layers of our countryside. People with blood and vigor like Zhuan San Wan are of course burning with anger and want to rise up and raise their arms.</p>
<p>However, the people entered deeper. The demon-like claws easily stretched into South China again. The rumbling artillery fire shook the four suburbs of the village, and the flames in the sky dyed the eyes of the villagers red.</p>
<p>"Turn Three Bays, this year's dragon boat race can't be held, but we will always have this day to enter the Stone Rock!" A young man said to Zhuan San Wan with a long face.</p>
<p>"..." Several blue veins were bursting on Zhuan San Wan's face, his eyes were emitting a light of hatred, and the words he wanted to answer in his mouth were blocked by the anger that swelled in his chest.</p>
<p>The next day, there was no sign of Zhuan San Wan in the village, and no one knew where he had gone.</p>
<p>The artillery fire had not stopped, but it had not gotten any closer either. For four months, the had simply been unable to pass the blockade line of the West River. The villagers farmed and lived as usual under the piercing artillery fire, and gradually forgot about Zhuan San Wan.</p>
<p>One evening, the remaining sunlight was casting on the pond in front of the village. Zhuan San Wan was found sitting alone on the stone railing by the pond, wearing a faded, tattered military uniform. His left hand was wrapped in a piece of white cloth hanging from his neck, and his face was clearly darker and stronger than before. A group of surprised eyes surrounded him, and a lot of doubts asked him.</p>
<p>In the conversation, they learned that Zhuan San Wan had been a soldier for the past few months, and also knew that he had come back this time because he was injured.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I don't understand what ability the Japanese devils have to occupy our Northeast, occupy our Shanghai, occupy our Nanjing, occupy our Guangzhou, occupy our Hankou. Just that West River, which is as shallow and narrow as this, they have no way to pass through. If they come, they will be driven away by us ten out of ten times. Sometimes they can't even run away. But I, Zhuan San Wan, rely on this paddle, but I often rush over and rush back again, and I have never suffered any losses."</p>
<p>"Good Turn Three Bays!"</p>
<p>"Long live Turn Three Bays!"</p>
<p>"Long live the Republic of China! Long live our village!"</p>
<p>"Down with the Japanese devils!"</p>
<p>A large group of villagers were so excited that they shouted. A clever person took out a native cigarette and stuffed it into Zhuan San Wan's mouth, and another quickly lit it for him.</p>
<p>The sun went down, and Zhuan San Wan was embraced by a group of dragon boat paddlers into the ancestral hall. They pooled money and busied themselves buying fish, meat, and wine, and ate and drank in the ancestral hall. The door was closed, and occasionally a burst of wild laughter, a burst of cheers, and a burst of roars came out, and finally nothing could be heard.</p>
<p>The next day, there was no trace of Zhuan San Wan in the village again, and the more than ten guys were also nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>It has been more than two months again. Neither Zhuan San Wan nor any of the group of guys have returned. Have they all entered the Stone Rock? No one knows. But the still cannot break through the blockade line of the West River, and the villagers are still farming and living as usual under the piercing artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Journey</h3>
<p>— Ma Yin Yin</p>
<p>Painful heart</p>
<p>Shattered a once living journey</p>
<p>Lonely</p>
<p>I stole away from the embrace of my motherland</p>
<p>This is Hong Kong</p>
<p>Sea wind</p>
<p>Sea waves</p>
<p>Sea mist</p>
<p>Daze the island</p>
<p>Island, like a mythical monster</p>
<p>Night covers mystery and profoundness</p>
<p>On the other side, there are also</p>
<p>Battleships, merchant ships, dilapidated small boats</p>
<p>The roar of the sea under the orange color</p>
<p>Is a peach blossom spring in a chaotic generation</p>
<p>A kind of ancient poet's secluded interest</p>
<p>I stopped</p>
<p>This prosperous night market</p>
<p>Sweep away the dust that once stained the edge of my clothes</p>
<p>Two weeks of continuous overcast</p>
<p>Today, still wandering the streets</p>
<h3>Learning and Practice</h3>
<p>— You Hong</p>
<p>A friend from the mainland sent a letter. One of the paragraphs said: "...I really want to go to Hong Kong and live the same life as you. If the plan is well thought out, I will do so; because, in Hong Kong, I can possibly learn everything I like to learn. Although, it is a bit sad to say wandering life, but I need to change the air so much, and it is good to learn a little more while I am young. This is not just my wish, but also my plan. If I can't make it this year, it won't be too late next year. I must be able to realize it, and then a wish will be fulfilled..."</p>
<p>In the past, there was a fashionable saying: "Learn from Mr. Lu Xun!" What should we learn from Mr. Lu Xun? Learn his unyielding and indomitable fighting spirit, and his academic achievements; in other words, we must adopt his perseverance and courageous struggle against the , and use all the weapons and secrets against the enemy. And we should also use our weapons as much as possible here to attack the enemies of our nation and the traitors who betray our motherland; because, in this era of great struggle, everyone is difficult to avoid struggle, especially in today's increasingly urgent national crisis, the spirit of struggle is even more needed, which is the inevitable condition that should be paid attention to in "learning".</p>
<p>In Hong Kong today, there are many unemployed and out-of-school youths, and we all need to learn, especially in today's situation where the has turned to a stalemate, the war zone is expanding, and the number of refugees is increasing. Here, generally ambitious youths can find learning opportunities, and should work harder!</p>
<p>Although, generally youths have a considerable understanding in theory, but they are at a loss for practical problems and cannot solve them. Therefore, I feel that our "learning" should be a combination of "theory" and "practice".</p>
<p>I am a youth, and I am also learning, learning in this special environment. I dare not guarantee that I will never be in danger of being contaminated by toxins (?). However, I want to find a piece of fresh air from the dark night shrouded in dust and coal smoke. I want to cultivate this night of slavery to welcome the dawn. In this way, I only have this one answer for my friend who wrote from the mainland. What else can I say besides this?</p>
<p>Finally, I quote Mr. Lu Xun: "In the struggle against the old forces and the old society, we must be resolute, persistent, and constantly, and pay attention to strength..." This is to be taken as a word of encouragement for the youths in Hong Kong in their learning.</p>
<p>The times need us, we must learn modestly, learn practically, and run with the wheels of the great era!</p>
<h3>Husband Jiang</h3>
<p>— Luo Feng</p>
<p>"No," I argued, trying to reason, "Aren't millions of soldiers on the front lines right now demanding repayment from the Japanese ××?"</p>
<p>"You still don't understand what I mean. I'm talking about my family. Look, both of my old folks are nearing seventy, and while their hearts are willing, their bodies are weak. My elder brother is an opium addict, and that bastard is planning to take a concubine again. Even if you dragged him to the front lines, he'd be scared witless by the first shot. Can my wife go to the front lines? The kid just learned to call me 'dad.' That bastard, besides me, who else is there?"</p>
<p>About a week later. As we were eating lunch, a noisy commotion erupted from the depths of the courtyard. This sound consisted of an old voice, a thin voice, and a clangorous sound. I listened carefully; the clangorous one was undoubtedly Jiang the Younger, the old one I presumed to be Jiang the Younger's father, and the thin voice? Must be Husband Jiang's wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bai, seeing me staring blankly, bowl in hand, mocked me, saying:</p>
<p>"Why don't you go take a look? You seem very concerned about the people's livelihood."</p>
<p>"You don't know the full story..." I put down my bowl and replied seriously, then truly walked towards the door.</p>
<p>"What full story?...This is just being idle because you're well-fed," she said, watching me walk out of the room. "Just take a look and come back. Don't interfere in other people's family matters..."</p>
<p>Finally, there was a sharp, short laugh, containing an element of mockery that seeped into my consciousness, transforming into a thin layer of disgust.</p>
<p>A housewife is most skilled at slander. And if the seeds of resentment are sown in the heart of a housewife, they will grow into an evergreen tree that never withers, because the narrow world of the family is not suitable for people with open minds to survive.</p>
<p>Reaching the outer layer of houses in the courtyard, I saw Jiang the Younger. My guess was correct. This was clearly a major dispute brewing over "methods." Jiang the Younger was jumping around wildly, his arms and legs flailing. The old man was stomping his dark walking stick, using coughs as a substitute for words he couldn't fully express. The woman, like a half-crazed person, was shouting and cursing irrationally:</p>
<p>"Are you still going to be so heartless?...Beware of ×××× bombs!...</p>
<p>"Curse all you want," Jiang the Younger bent his waist and waved his hand, indicating non-resistance. Then, he straightened up and directed a worker resembling a plasterer on the roof.</p>
<p>"Tear down the tiles!" He issued the order decisively. "Tear them down, you bastard!"</p>
<p>However, the old man tried his best to stop it.</p>
<p>"You bastard, that won't do!"</p>
<p>"It will." Jiang the Younger pointed at the worker on the roof and shouted, "You bastard, tear them down for me."</p>
<p>"See if you dare to tear them down!" The woman stretched out her claw-like hands and pounced on Jiang the Younger like a ferocious tiger, gnashing her teeth and muttering, "Are you bullying me, a woman? Are you blind? I'm not afraid of anyone, I've seen Japanese devils!"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of ×××× either!" Jiang the Younger rolled up the sleeves of his khaki Zhongshan suit and puffed out his chest, preparing to fight.</p>
<p>At this moment, if I hesitated even slightly, war would inevitably break out. The old man was truly willing but unable, turning around and shouting into the inner courtyard for help. Therefore, I couldn't stand by and watch.</p>
<p>When I appeared between them, both Jiang the Younger and the woman were stunned and withdrew their hands, but Husband Jiang was the first to grab my sleeve, saying:</p>
<p>"Look, this woman is worse than the Japanese devils—" Before I could speak, the woman grabbed my other sleeve, saying:</p>
<p>"Am I cruel? Please judge who is the wolf." She wasn't from Sichuan, but the way she spoke was like popping beans, making it impossible to tell what dialect she spoke. These two rooms originally had a rent of fifty yuan for half a year, which expired yesterday, but I had already asked him to renew the lease. But he didn't raise the rent earlier or later, and yesterday he suddenly raised it to one hundred and twenty yuan. I begged him to raise it less, since I am a refugee. But he said, 'Too much, or move out quickly.' But you think, housing is so tight these days, where am I going to find a place in one day? This morning he came to chase me, I said the house is hard to find, I am afraid I will not find one in a day or two, and he said, if I do not find it, I am sorry, I am going to demolish the house, isn't that right?" She pointed at the worker on the roof. "He really came to tear it down. Please judge, who is the cruel one?"</p>
<p>"Listen to me," Jiang the Younger said, seizing the opportunity to interject, "That chicken, everything is expensive, everyone's life is affected, isn't it extra for me to raise her rent a little?"</p>
<p>"You raised it by five hundred yuan. Your house, you have the right to, but why didn't you wait until I found a house and deliberately tear down the house to drive me out? You wolf!"</p>
<p>"How am I doing it deliberately? Didn't you say that followed, ever since we built this house, two people have died one after another. This house is suppressing the White Demon God, so it must be torn down and rebuilt. Today is the day to break ground..."</p>
<p>"Speaking against your conscience, you're fooling me, old woman!..."</p>
<p>"Shh! You bastard, it's decided to tear it down! Tear down the tiles!"</p>
<p>The old man laboriously raised the antique walking stick, threatening Jiang the Younger, and while coughing, he cursed:</p>
<p>"Husband Jiang,...you've turned this family into a chicken coop,...you...bastard, get...out! Get out!...I regret having you..."</p>
<p>Jiang the Younger, unhurriedly dodged the old man's cane, swaying his wide hips from side to side, and walked angrily towards the outer courtyard, muttering in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Who doesn't regret it, I'm just not happy to manage this messy household!"</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>Aren't they the same flesh and blood as human beings? It seemed to say that the murderer who killed her would not be him, but her own father—the traitor of the motherland. If you record this hatred, do not misremember the name of the hater. It seemed to say, wishing happiness after death to those unfortunate in life, blessing her soul to find a permanent place in the sacred sky, accompanying the sun and moon, and resting in peace forever. She immediately knocked his hand away, thinking it was being instigated to seek lewdness and sin. She looked at him—no longer the incompetent one after putting away the pistol, nor the vicious thug who threatened her with the pistol, but another person—like an ignorant and expressionless statue, and at this time, complemented by the night, she felt even more isolated and terrified on the snowy road. So she retreated in fear, trying to get away from him, but her wrist was held, as if locked by an iron chain. As a result, she could only step on the snow continuously with her feet, trying to break free. They struggled for a long time, but the hand that was held still did not belong to her.</p>
<p>The snow fell even heavier. Before it fell, the snow seemed to be layers of snowflakes, each as wide as the sky, but it was broken by the storm in the middle of its descent, shattered into giant leaves, and after landing, it restored its original integrity. This disc-like body could be seen clearly, increasing layer by layer, seemingly not allowing a single drop of alien color to be leaked in the universe, seemingly secretly arranging the funeral altar for all mankind. Everything seen was silent dead, and the desolate wind was the weeping of mourners from beyond the sky. In this tragic atmosphere, he began to say to her:</p>
<p>"I can't let you go, and you refuse to come with me; then, I can only... beat you to death here, please forgive me!"</p>
<p>She seemed to be startled by this sincere tone; so she did not dare to stubbornly say:</p>
<p>"Beat me to death then,"</p>
<p>"Ah? Beat to death..." She immediately asked again: "If you beat me to death, do you still need money?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, I'm just going to beat you to death!"</p>
<p>"Then why can't you let me go?"</p>
<p>"Why?...Why?...It's to solve this job!" (34)</p>
