<p>社評</p>
<h3>東方侵略者的誘惑與××　——論日本答覆英美法三國通牒</h3>
<p>鑒於日本侵略者在遠東的×××行，破壞九國公約，破壞中國領土主權的完整與列強在遠東權益的安全，美英法三國曾於去年十月十二月及今年正月，先後向日本政府提出措辭強硬的牒文，三國牒文均曾明白聲明：（一）日本今日在遠東所爲，顯然破壞中國領士主權完整及中國門戶開放的原則：（二）對于以武力造成的任何遠東新形勢，斷然不能承認：（三）繼續遵守九國公的，一切問題須以國際會議方式求取公允的解決。美英法三國這種鄭重強硬的通牒，當然是給日本侵畧者的當頭棒喝，尤其是正值日本侵略者在華進攻進入新困難階叚之時，確可視爲重大的打擊，而爲日本在國際上不義寡助的新鮮例證。</p>
<p>日本侵略者怎樣應付英美法各國這種強硬通牒呢？他們有二條路可走，第一條路是接受英美法各國抗議，停止侵華軍事，舉行國際會議，共商遠東問題的澈底解決。第二條路是斷然拒絕英美法各國抗議，繼續推進所謂創造遠東新秩序的步驟。但是第一條路顯然是法西斯侵略路綫的根本否定，形成日本向歐美列強整個投降，不僅日本法西斯軍閥所不能承認，而且亦爲日本財閥金融資本家領袖所不忍目睹的。至於第二條路，爲日本軍閥所主張，亦爲財閥金融資本家領袖的意圖，不過這樣一來，不僅更將增加日本侵略者在國際上的困難，而目實際上他們已經臨於無力支持侵華軍事的困境，怎能多樹強敵自速滅亡？因爲這兩條路走不通，便想出了餌誘與嚇詐雙管齊下的政策。</p>
<p>據路透社三十日東京電訊，日本將於日間通知英美兩國，表示日本願意與彼等直接談判對華「門戶開放」與「機會均等」原則之修改，這是一種餌誘。這種餌誘政策的用意，就在掩蓋日本侵略中國擴大遠東勢力範圍所給於歐美列強的損害，就在餌誘歐美列強目迷於名不符實的「門戶開放」「機會均等」原則，悉舉各國遠東權益隸屬於日本侵略者的統治之下，爲日本侵略者終身服務，加緊搾壓中國以至遠東各地弱小民族，而向日本取得佣金或工資。而且他還特別聲明與各國分別直接談判，不願參加國際會議，這更可見其對於和平民主各國實行各個擊破，破壞和平民主各國聯合制裁的狡計。</p>
<p>路透社同日東京消息又稱日本雖表示願意與英美直接談判，在談判前，英美兩國首先必須承認某等條件，包括（一）世界商務之完全自由，（二）東方種族居住與旅行之自由，（三）取銷關稅壁壘與入口之限制，及有關民族生存原料之自由購取。這是餌誘之後的嚇詐，卽是說明日本决不放棄推進「日滿支集團」與建立　「東亞新秩序」的立塲和行動。特別是路透社東京電訊所稱日本覆牒中所將強調之點，卽在所謂「世界商務完全自由」一點，包括（一）取銷現在經濟集團（二）取銷關稅壁壘：又在所謂「資源公平分配」一點，包括（一）民族生存原料之自由購取（二）國防所需資源之自由獲得。這兩點不僅要求英美公開承認今後日本在中國的劫掠與在遠東的武力發展爲合法，並且還要担負供給日本侵略所需原料與資金的義務！</p>
<p>從日本方面預先透露出來的這種對英美覆牒內容看來，足見日本侵略者對英美列強的強硬通牒，雖然採取餌誘與嚇詐並行的對策，但其毫無和平解決遠東糾紛的誠意，亦可謂暴露無餘了。尤其是當此意德兩個西方侵略××在西班牙新獲勝利，釀成了險惡萬態的歐洲嚴重局勢的時候，尤其是當此英法兩國統治者，雖然痛受損害而仍未肯澈底放棄對侵略者的妥協政策的時候，尤其是當此全世界各國正義人士與勞動大衆反法西斯反侵略統一戰綫尚沒有形成全面展開的時候，東方侵略者日本××之乘機誘脅英美法各國，企圖繳盡他們反抗的武器，進而作爲日本侵略者的助手，這是絲亳不足驚奇的。</p>
<p>我們今日所應注意的，第一，日本這種餌誘與嚇詐的政策，雖然可以反證日本侵畧者內外困難的嚴重，及其必將因此更加增重此種困難，然而同時不能忽視日本法西斯侵略者與德意法西斯侵略者緊密勾結的事實，這種事實是日本今後繼續××胃險與陰謀餌誘雙管齊下政策的根據，我們必須隨時揭發日×這種陰謀，忠告和平民主友邦。其次，英法各和平民主友邦一日不澈底放棄其對法西斯侵略者妥協政策，則日德意各侵略國家的嚇詐的胃險，便將更無忌憚，任何嚴重抗議強硬通牒均將成爲無用的符　。因此我們必須督促英法美各友邦在此種嚴重抗議強硬通牒遭遇失敗後，應該用密切合作的實際力量來還擊法西斯侵略者，粉碎任何餌誘與嚇詐與陰謀。最後我們必須明瞭此種反擊的事實，只有在全世界名國正義和平人民與被壓迫大衆的聯合推動之下才能實現，因此我們必須動員一切力量去組織這種偉大力量。</p>
<h3>航空學校訪問記</h3>
<p>— 本報昆明特約通訊</p>
<p>「母忘覓橋」！當你走進那簡潔莊嚴的，現在××處的航空學校大禮堂時，那裏面掛着許多警惕人心的標語，但這裏面使你最觸目的，就是上面這四個字了。</p>
<p>『橋』，乃在浙江杭州，是中國空軍的發祥地，也是現在××航空學校的原有校址。</p>
<p>呌學生不可忘了覓　，就是叫學生不可忘了『收復失地』。這是××航校最可使人得到刺激的在大禮堂裏的一句標語。</p>
<p>××航校　在雖已　到××的後方，但他們在訓練空軍人才以外，他們沒有一個人不是志在前方的，我們對於前方空軍猛勇的作戰，不畏一切地造成非常的紀錄，假使肴到他們這發祥地母校大禮堂的警惕人心底標語以後。就知道不是沒有線因的。</p>
<p>當我去訪問航校政訓處徐禦林主任的時候，他的招待是很和氣的，他是浙江人，在國語的談話中往往漏出了他那原有的響音。當我們談到國家抗戰前途的時候，他對于我國空軍方面的作戰能力，表示出勝利的把握，那態度又是非常的堅决，後來，我問到他關于政訓處在全校所負的乃是怎樣一種使命的時候，他除了說明在給學生以政治上的認識以外，…………，他和我剛走到大禮堂的門口，於是他又微笑地望着大禮堂外面一副水泥的對聯：「誓做國家忠臣，必爲領袖死士。」的確，他這時雖，有出聲，但對於政訓處在航空學校所負的最重大使命，及其精神何在，在這副水泥的對聯上，它是可以替代道位主任先生來說明着他所要說的一切了。</p>
<p>後來，又到校長辦公處去訪問，大門口掛着兩塊寫着自色黑底的木牌，乃是「校長室」，「教育長室」。</p>
<p>現在××航空學校的這位教育長，他是代表蔣委員長執行校政的，大家都很熟知的周至柔氏了。因爲周教育長在執行校政時，是代表蔣校長一切的，所以人家往往是稱之日周校長先生。</p>
<p>走進了校長會客窒以後，那潔淨整齊的室內　置，四周充滿淸朗　快的太陽光綫，是代表全校充滿朝氣底師生精神一樣，反映進每一個去訪問者的心目之中。我當時雖然還沒有見到這位全校主人的險容，但在腦裏已由想像中湧出一種典型了。當教育長出來和我握手的時候；那高大的身材，有神的眼光，可以看出夾者，乃是個性與毅力都極堅強，而又經過長時期磨鍊過來的一位人物。握手時又是那樣的疏露出　誠與沉着，使人引起一種極難形容與描述的好感。這位周敎育長給人第一惆印象，是超出了在我初進會客室時那種想像中的典型了。</p>
<p>我當時對於有關軍事行動上的一切校務問題，在這國家抗戰時期知道是不能公佈的，所以也就不作問詢。但對於全校的學生生活狀況，則頗想訪問一　寫出來　告讀者。因爲這也是全國讀者所急於想知道的事實。</p>
<p>周教育長對於我這個要求，是答應可向學生的膳廳與宿舍等去觀察與訪問的。快要和周教育長分別以前，就和他　了一幅坐像，留爲紀念。</p>
<p>××航空學校，原名中央航空學校，是全國各航空學校的總校。他這裏面訓練出來的學生，都是預備着做空軍軍官的。所以××航空學校學生的程度，是要高中畢業權有資格去投考的，那程度的水準，也比別處都要高。那裏的學生只嬰一列入畢業典禮，就是空軍軍官了。學生的入學考試，在智職與體格上，規定的條件都極嚴，所以學生的程度也就非常整齊。抗　以來的許多有名飛將軍，都是在這裏面任教職與剛畢業的軍官。</p>
<p>當我訪問一位空軍教官時，問他對學生的主張是怎樣？他微笑地和我說道：「我們全校師生，都是前後的同學。以前我的許多學生是現在巳做了我的朋友，就是我以前的許多老師，現在一起工作與玩笑，也都大家成了朋友了。這裏對于所謂『師生關係』是看得很輕的一個問區。我們只是先後的同學。我們要更進一步地嚴格說起來，大家都是『中國的空軍同志』。我們有的是「前後的階段」，我們這裏在所謂師生問題上，是决沒有什麼「上下高低的階段」問題存在的」。</p>
<p>這話是很確實的。我們可以看出許多軍官在年齡上是頗有些相差，但他們在感情上表現出來，都非常的親　和愛，這是證明那位空軍教官的說話並無矯造或誇張之處。</p>
<p>至於許多教官和學生的關係，只要看他們互相的行動，也就很可以證明的教官在和學生相遇時，那態度與臉色上都顯出一種非常愛護的神情，而學生對於教官，則可以用一句成語代表一切的，即：『執禮甚恭』。</p>
<p>學生的體格鄭極高大強健。學校在學生投老時的體格檢查當然非常有關係，可是學生在進了學校以後，那體育上健身鍛練運動，也是有着非常重大底關係的。所以學生的日常生活，在健身運動上每天佔去了很多的時間。當我們去參閱××航空學校的學生在校活動，那注意的就是到他們的運動塲去好了。航空學校的各種球藝，在××地方所以是非常的有名，遇到同各大學比賽時，航空學校總是佔着優勢的。那當然爲了投考航空學校的學生，他們身體因爲入校以前本來爲了注意於運動而非常強健，可是入校以後的健身鍛鍊非常注重，所以在各種球藝上優良的成續也就成了必然底結果。最後，航空學校學生的強　體格，除了上面那入校以前本來嚴格檢查的挑選手續，以及入校後的努力運動二種關係以外，還有一種非要軍要的關係，那就是在校的衛生營養問題了。</p>
<p>關於××航空畢校的學生營養問題，最近有件很有趣，同時又是可以令人引起很大感想的事情，我想不妨都附帶着在此地戰告一下。</p>
<p>××航空學校以前在寬橋的時候，學生的營養食品學校當局是非常注意的，每天早晨都有稀飯與牛奶等物供給。現在到了××地方，因爲全城的牛奶出產量很少，不夠全校學生的分配，於是學生每天早晨，只有稀飯而減去了牛奶。大家在稀飯方面是可以儘量吃飽，但在牛奶方面是缺少了。當我在訪問一位航空學校某同學的時候，因爲談起生活方面的膳食問題，於是就提到了這缺去了牛奶的一件事，我當時就問他有什麼感想？他當時很激昂地答覆着道：『在這國家的全面抗戰中，多少失地的同胞，大家連粥那要沒有吃了，我們每天早晨減去一份牛奶又有什麼值得重視的。即以平時來說，我們的一衣一食，那樣不從全國的同胞們手中得來？我們的爲國效勞至於捐軀，這是我們應有的軍人天職，我們看着失地同胞種種的遭難，心裏常感到重大的不安，恨不能立刻飛上前去和××拚命。現在我們雖然每天早展缺少了一份牛奶，但我們每次在進餐時，看到每一粒粒雪白的米，就會想起了失地的，前方的，後方的受苦受難的同胞，我們　想努力學成空軍所具有的作戰與駕駛技術，爲我們全國的同胞去報仇，出氣。至於一些食料上的增減，道在我們是覺得並不怎樣重要的問題。我們很知道，全國的父老兄弟妹姊，他們都很熱烈地盼望着我們的，我們也決不會辜負他們一片厚望的，請你失生在責戰上報告他們好了，我們是一定要替他們去復仇雪恥的。我們的身體本來已是國家的。巳是全國同胞所公有的，請他們放心好了」！</p>
<p>這位航空學校的同學，在講到『睛他們放。好了』的時候，那眼淚已在微紅的眼眶裏漏出來。我布在非常感動之下，緊緊地握了那告別的手。</p>
<p>在我要退出××航空學校之前，我忽然看到了二條標語，現在就寫出來作爲本篇訪問的結語：</p>
<p>『我們的身體飛機和炸彈，當與敵人在艦陣地同蠕於盡！』　（李寶泉）</p>
<h3>衡陽四大事</h3>
<p>— 王坪</p>
<p>打「落水狗」汪精衛</p>
<p>廿八年的第一砲，就是國民黨開徐叛賣黨國，向×求和的汪精衛，這是一聲巨響，激動了所有的中國人，甚至國際人士，在很多人的腦模上，給晝上了一個『？』。衡陽的救亡工作者，敏捷地想藉此作一次擴大的政治宣傳，於是四處奔走呼號，推動這運動的早日實現，結果，四處的反汪高潮沖激起衡陽的黨政當局，决定召集一次討汪大會，（後來，因感到汪並用不着『討』，便改用『裁』汪）在開會前，由各救亡團體——首先是軍委會戰時服務團衡陽服務所與軍委會政治部抗×演劇隊第八隊及漢口女靑年會戰時服務團發起，開了一個反汪座談會，這會上，到了政府機關的代表，及各文化，工作，服務團體及個人，展開了熱烈的討論，特別是粤漢路工代表的說話，博得衆人的掌聲</p>
<p>「……我們反汪，要打擊汪逆的言論，要肅清每一角落的汪逆的應聲虫，抗戰就好比是火車頭，火車頭一面接受新的燃料，一面便將殘渣淘汰出來，汪逆就是被發掘出來的煤炭，不但不足爲惜，而且還非常有利……」他用他的生活做適切的比例，非常受聽衆的歡迎。</p>
<p>整整討論了五個鐘頭之久，得出了共同的結論：</p>
<p>（一）汪逆是一個十足的投機政客，在他的革命史及生命史上，充滿了動搖卑鄙出賣革命的污點，連他最爲人讀的刺殺攝政王，也是投機取巧。（原來，刺殺攝政王是同盟會的决定。刺殺的方法，是埋炸彈，由汪等幾人輪流看守引綫，待攝政王經過時便點火炸之，結果，輪注看守時，攝政王正經過，而汪警慌異常，事未成，便被淸兵捉住，後來，汗將整個計劃，同謀同志，通盤說出，藉此献媚淸廷，得淸廷護送日本留學，而其他同志則全部死於非命，此實革命史中最大之污點也。）</p>
<p>（二）汪逆是一個典型個人私利重於民族利益者，他為了達利自己的私慾，不惜採取最卑劣的手段。</p>
<p>（三）抗戰期中，汪逆之所以也隨聲附和者，乃抗戰勢力壓倒「和」力，但他仍隨時隨地找機會破壤抗戰，例如他歷次談話，都是很技巧的宣傳反動。</p>
<p>（四）汪逆的叛變是時間問題是預定計劃。</p>
<p>（五）因此，我們要普遍深入的宣傳，以免汪逆成爲西班牙佛朗哥第二。</p>
<p>（六）此次政府及領袖的斷然處置，是最爲人民所擁護，是表明政府及國民黨的　明與抗戰到底的决心。</p>
<p>（七）通電，出特刊，畫刊，寫反汪劇本，歌曲，並立刻組識宣傳部下鄉。</p>
<p>這次座談會的主席，就是衡陽各界反汪大會主席之一的劉陳列先生，我們要求他把這次紀錄報告大好會，展開更擴大的對論。</p>
<p>義賣之潮正在汎瀾</p>
<p>自從義賣之火在香港燃　以後，全中國的每一角落都有了義賣的火花；湖南首創義會的是衡陽的大剛報，接着響應的是軍委會政治　抗×演劇第八隊，除了抽出該隊生活費之一部份預買大剛的第一份報外，並決定公演一天，將收入全部貢獻給抗戰；接着駐衝各劇團也粉紛響應，組織了一個響應義運公演委員會，規定連演七天。這裏面的組成份子，除了第八隊外，有教育部第一巡迴戲劇教育隊，四九劇團，七七劇團，湘戲，新戲——演出的劇本，有劇教一隊的『古城的怒吼』五募劇，四九的「東北一角」「寒衣曲」，七七的「炸藥」及其他，抗劇八隊的「鳳凰城」四慕劇，——這個劇本是描寫東北義勇軍苗可秀，鄧鉄梅，趙侗（遊擊隊母親趙老太太的兒子）……等在堅苦的×人後方，作英勇鬥爭的情況，係一最新傑作，在中國僅在重慶上演過一次，此次爲二次公演，——公演日期是本月十八日起。</p>
<p>各劇團正在努力籌備期中，大剛報的義賣日（十五日）到來了，於是大家都異常踴躍的參加義　銷報隊，總結大剛報收入共四千二百多元，佔全國各報義賣收入的第三位，而且還銷了一份五百元的報，打破全國的紀錄。</p>
<p>現在正在義賣的除了戲劇界外，還有幾家酒館舉行八天的二成義賣，總之。義　像一顆大石頭　入平靜的水面一樣，正在擴大他的浪圈。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>

<h3>五中全會宣言全文</h3>
<p>（中央社重慶卅日電），第五屆中央執行委員會第五次全體會議，今日發表宣言。原文云：去年四月臨時全國代表大會後，本黨根據大會决議，及抗戰建國綱領，淬厲全國同胞，繼續努力於神聖之抗戰，同時卽於抗戰之中，進行建國之工作。十八閱月來，軍民一德一心，意志彌堅，戰區雖有轉移，國基益形鞏固。自廣州失守，武漢撤退，抗戰局勢，乃由前期而轉入後期：前期抗戰之主旨在於消耗乂人力量，暴露乂人陰謀，完成後期抗戰之方略與布置；後期抗戰之任務，則在承接前期奮鬥之成績，發揮我前後方及被估地區一切抗戰力量，以期獲得最後勝利與建國之成功。第五次中央全體會議，適舉行於抗戰後期開始之今日，追念十八閱月之戰蹟，及吾全國將士民衆之光榮犧牲與貢献，深覺繼此以後之奮鬥，實爲决定我民族存亡興替之關鍵。爰就內外事實，詳悉檢討，確立後期抗戰方略，努力實行。茲爲我全黨同志，全國同胞，本其要旨，竭誠以告。</p>
<p>×侵略僅年半　已陷山窮水盡</p>
<p>過去十八閱月中之抗戰，×人侵略愈深，兵力愈竭，財政經濟社會之危機，愈加深重。自魯南之戰至江河之戰諸役，×兵傷亡，又加五十餘萬，戰費且增至九十餘萬萬。國內政潮迭起，傾軋益深，至最近數月間，乃發表其所謂「建立東亞新秩序」之宣言，希圖藉此狂論，掩其暴惡，然世界各國，已無不洞燭其隱。</p>
<p>我神聖抗戰之目的，在求國家獨立，民埃生存，失地雖廣，死傷難多，而全國軍民同仇敵愾，精神益振，人人以必死之决心，爲國家建永生之大業。吾國素爲愛好和平之民族，今之所以堅忍久戰，不辭一切權牲者，實爲日本軍閱不斷以武力侵略，肆其蠶食鯨吞政策，入於最後關頭之結果。自九一八事變發生，日本悍然不顧一切，破壤九國公約，國聯盟約與非戰公約，實行佔領我東北四省，前年七月七日，更逞其凄，進攻蘆溝橋佔領平津，我國脈民命，已至存亡絕續之時，全國上下，無可再忍，故雖自知乒備武器不如×人，然爲保持國家民族之生存，不得已而從事艱苦慘烈之抗戰。「和平尚有一綫之希望，絕不放棄和平；犧牲已至最後關頭，决然犧牲」。——此吾黨總裁再三申述之决心，亦我國民一致信守之國策。</p>
<p>彼日本軍閥併吞大陸之野心，在外則爲世界之公敵，在內則爲人民所共恨，觀乎九一八事件以後，數年之間，彼之首相被暗殺者三，藏相被暗殺者二，海陸軍大將被暗殺者四九，大學教授被捕禁者逾百人，人民之因反戰而被刑戳者，且無慮數千人。共今日所保持之統一，僅爲軍閥淫威之表現，古語有曰：「兩軍相遇，哀者勝矣」。我全國同胞抵禦侵略之悲憤，維護和平之正氣已足爲克×之主力，際茲後明抗戰開始之時，更為全國同胞共同一致堅持舊鬥之要義。</p>
<p>抗戰最後目的　在求人類幸福</p>
<p>臨時全國代表大會宣言有云：「吾人之所求，爲合乎正義之和平，非屈服之和平：屈服祇以助長侵略。」臨時全國代表大會，更明白指出，爲確立主權領土與行政之完整，實現平等自由之國家，不達目的，决不中止。總理創造革命救國之三民主義，領導國民復興中華，建立民國，爲國家爭獨立，爲民族爭生存，爲東亞謀永久之和平，爲世界樹尊嚴之正義，今之抗戰，義亦如斯。彼日本之文明，始則求之於高麗，繼則就之於吾國，衣食住行之物，仁義道德之理，何一非吾所共，吾國以富強著於東亞號幾千年，日本之強，數十年耳，而高麗巳早爲其所滅，今更進而圖併我中國，觀彼軍閥之狂言，直欲統制全球，臣服歐美，其退出國際聯盟，撕裂九國公約，猶僅爲施狂暴於世界之見端耳。吾國今日之所以堅决抗戰者，其目的固在抵禦侵略吾國之×人，恢復我主權領土及行政之完整，實亦爲懲創破壞條約尊嚴，危害世界和平之戒首，切望舉世維護和平之友邦，發揮協同一致之精神，保隙利害共同之條約，施有效之方法，消蔓延之戰禍，蓋必如此，乃可以求得世界人類之和平，增進人類之幸福，此吾四萬萬五千萬人共同之認識，堅定不移之决心也。</p>
<p>各國一致助我　消弭戰爭慘禍</p>
<p>綜觀一年來國際形勢之演變緊張，頗有似乎昔年歐戰之前夕，而危機深廣，則遠非歐戰時可此。即以×日侵略中國戰爭開始以來之情形例之，彼以空軍轟炸我不設防城市鄉村及文化建築，其殘暴兇猛之情景，均非歐戰之所有，凡世界愛好和平，崇尚正義之國家，政府人民無不同具迫切之感應。過去數年間，偉欲以唇舌文字相號召，重伸國際公法之效力，阻止戰禍之蔓延者，今亦轉變方針，同時謀以實力作自衛共衛之保障。蓋時至今日，無論如何，巳明知日本之侵略中國，即爲威脅太平洋之根基；而太平洋乃世界最大之市場。去秋×軍侵迫武漢，進襲廣州，封鎖長江珠江兩大河流，國際聯合會，適於此際集會，英法蘇俄等諸友邦，仗義戮力，一致聲援，爰通過盟約第十六條所規定之制裁，適用於日本之侵略。最近國聯行政院一月十九日之决議，復邀請與遠東時局有關各國，相互協商，俾採取有效措置，予吾國以援助。而美國總統羅斯福，同於此際，力持九國公約對×日作堅决之警告，英法繼起共維斯約，此其目的，不獨在制止×日之侵略，亦實在於弭消一切破壞世界和平之慘禍，吾國處艱危之際，對此扶顯持危之高誼，固深感不忘。亦確信吾中華民族，竭盡其維護公理正義之精誠，所貢献於人類文明，世界和平之前途者，必足以副各友邦之厚望；益堅吾中華民國，具有足以消弭世界戰爭，促進世界人類和平生活之决心。（電碼不明）</p>
<p>九國公約原則　我仍竭誠擁護</p>
<p>大戰之各國，芷苦於善後乏術之時，我總理即發表其發展中國實業之偉大計劃。認為（電碼不明）對于日本加緊侵略中國，世界各國，必陷于不能自拔之困境，反覆說明，雖言之（電碼不明）今美總統特舉九國公約，號召世界，維護公約，以資恢復東亞和平。而（電碼不明）九國公約之重大原則有二，一爲尊重中國主權領士行政之完整，二爲門戶開放與機會之均等（電碼不明），開發中國實業，更足確信吾國民不獨贊助門戶開放之原則，亦且願以公平互助之原則，與世界各國作互助和平之合作。</p>
<p>切望全國軍民　共爭最後勝利</p>
<p>總理發展中國實業計劃結論中最警切之語，一曰：「日本于每一戰爭之結局，輙獲最佳之報酬，無怪日本軍閥以戰爭爲最有利之事業。」今中國既已醒覺、日本即欲實施侵略政策、中國人亦必出而拒絕之。卽不幸中國爲日本（以下電碼不明約百餘字）建國必成之信念，既已確乎不可移易，當此神聖之犧牲，已發揮無上光明之今日，尤望全國軍民，益振其舊門之精神，勇猛前進，以爭取抗戰之勝利者，樹立建設中華民國之根基，以與世界友邦在互助和平之原則下，作眞誠之合作者，完成建設中華民國之偉業。必如是，而後不負吾同胞千百萬人之壯烈犧牲，且使吾全國國民與其子孫，以及世界無窮之人類，共受我軍民以生命所造成所保障之和平幸福於無窮。彼日本軍閥，狂悖之思想，狡毒之企圖，殘酷之行爲，今日所施于吾國者，還將結成彼所自受更爲悲慘之果。九一八以後，彼國中所不斷發生之悖逆事件，（電碼不明）所造成之惡果，恐較在（電碼不明）殘殺吾同胞之武器暴力爲尤多也。</p>
<p>明乎以上所述，可知堅决抗戰爲國民革命一貫之使命，亦爲吾人救國救世唯一之眞誠，暴×（電碼不明）吾全國軍民，自開戰以至於（電碼不明），加強團結，積極舊鬥與努力建設之事。而提高民族精神、以整飭革命紀律、更爲上述三事成功之保障。謹揭要義如左：</p>
<p>一日加強團結　實行三民主義</p>
<p>（一）所謂加強團結者。本會議認爲：團結必本於眞誠，而革命精神，必求其純一，臨時全國代表大會鄭重申言，期望全國有志之士，集中本黨，共同舊門。本屆會議，茲再懇切致望。國家艱危至此一必儘量增加抗戰建國實力，以收衆志成城之效。全國同胞，不問其過去政治見解與派別之如何，凡願實行三民主義，而參加本黨，從事國民革命抗戰建國之神聖事業者，無不誠摯歡迎。惟國民革侖之目的，在求得國家之獨立與民族之生存，故必保持中國民族眞誠純一之精神，而後國家之基礎，始能鞏固。本會議鄭重聲明，吾人絕不願見領導革命之本黨，發生二重黨籍之事實；更不忍中國實行三民主義，完成革命建國一貫之志業，因信仰不篤與意志不堅，致生頓挫。世界各國，當革命建國之始，無不由於舉國一致，上下一心，乃能拂除艱雞，以底成功，中外古今，絕無二道，自今以後，吾同胞必堂精誠團結，竭智盡忠，信行三民主義，爲後期抗戰，盡最善之努力，爲建國偉業，尊不拔之基礎。</p>
<p>二日積極奮鬥　始終努力抗戰</p>
<p>（二）所謂積極奮門者。吾同胞當知「行百里者半九十，最後行程，常最艱苦。吾人檢討過去一切工作，實猶未盡努力，所努力者未盡確實，未盡協調，亦未能言行一致，始終一貫貢献，以適戰時之要求。今之後期抗戰，實爲吾國與日本軍閱最後成敗之决賽，舉凡前方後方，尤其在被佔領區域，或鄰近戰區之軍民，一切思想行動，苟不能嚴加反省，嚴加檢舉，嚴加改正，以其能力自由生命完全貢献於國家，增加反攻之力量，則無數先烈犧牲舊鬥之成績，固功虧一簣，而我民族亦將不免於覆亡。故我同志同胞，自今以後，必須共矢忠誠，在最高統帥領導之下，絕無保留，絕無猶豫，勇往邁進，由此生死存亡之戰中，爭取國家獨立，民族生存之成功。</p>
<p>三日加緊建設　改善人民生活</p>
<p>（三）關於加緊建設者。吾人須知建國之主力在於建軍，非具堅如金石之國軍，則民生無所保障，民權無從維持，民族無由生存。而心理建設，政治建設，與經濟建設，實爲建軍之基礎。所謂心理建設者，必當根據總理知難行易之學說，發揚總理軍人之精神教育之主旨，普及國民軍訓，增進教育效能，推廣戰時服務，使全國同胞，無一不爲三民主義之革命戰士，以不成功卽成仁之精神，求得最後之勝利。所謂政治建設者，要求嚴明賞罰，綜義名實，集中力量，增進效率，加強民衆組織，統一民衆行動，解除人民痛苦，改善人民生活，而在後期抗戰開始，生死存亡所繫之關頭，尤宜組成中央黨政軍統一指揮之機構使全國黨政之工作，得與軍事相切合，以收共同行動之效，故特設置國防最高委員會，以統一黨政軍之指揮。關於經濟建設不僅爲抗戰勝負所繫，亦爲建國成敗所關，必當依於戰時人民生活之需要，分別輕重，斟酌緩念實行統制經濟，調節物質生產消費，舉凡抗戰必需之重工業鑛業，民生日用必需之輕工業，急要之鐵道，航空綫，公路等，應竭力之所能，努力興舉，更以鞏固幣制，流暢金融金，促公私產業之發展，他如農林畜牧之改進，全在蘊藏之開發，於各省生產能力之增加，尤當適合政府與人民一切資本技術之力，切實加緊推行，此種經濟建設，固爲充實抗戰之實力，亦爲實行民生主獎之基礎。至於在抗戰中，世界各友邦政府人民，或以物力財力相協助，或爲精神道義之聲援。或救濟傷病饑寒之軍民，或助我興復被×摧毀之學校，凡此高義，皆所永銘。深信吾國抗戰之結果，必能恢復我國家主權領土及行政完整，必能重振國聯盟約，九國公約，非戰公約之權威，豈獨門戶開放，機會均等之原則，得以實行，我總理二十年前，建議於世界，以國際和平互助之結合，共同開發中國實業之偉大計劃，亦於是得以實現。以我原料之富，市場之廣，戰後建設需要之切，對於消納外資與技術合作，及積各工業國現有之能力。亦絕不虞其過量，而我全國國民，今日多出一分之力，戰後必多獲十百倍之利，蓋凡眞正之經濟利益，於世界人類，絕無所私也。</p>
<p>執行革命紀律　提高民族精神</p>
<p>上述三事，爲我全國所應積極努力之目標，而根本要義，尤在提高民族精神，整飭革命紀律，以實現革命建國之三民主義。總理昔日講述電人精神教育，痛切說明：「人類有精神之用，非專恃物質之體。」「欲任非常之事業，必有賴非常，精神。「特舉智仁勇爲革命救國者，必須具備之道德：唯合於道義之智，始爲革命所需要之智；唯能臨事不避，一往無前，有不奪不懼之决死精神，始爲革命所需要之勇；亦唯「捨生救世，拾生救國，不問利害，竭盡責任」，始爲革命事業所賴以成就天仁。無求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁，始於大智，終於大勇，始能建設國家，完成革命，以保我民族奕世無疆之生命，我全國同胞，當此生死關頭，惟有以成仁取義之决心，實行三民主義之大道，人人誓死，舊勇效忠，以吾人數十年必死之生命、立國家億萬年永之根基，則抗戰不患其不勝，建國不患其不成。其在本黨同志，與一切任國家軍政之人員，尤當人人懷乎目身職責，與革命紀律之嚴重，以身作期，爲民前鋒。必須確立嚴肅之紀律，樹信賞必罰之正義，而後乃能集衆志爲一心，合衆力爲一體，不因一隅之失，危及國家，一人之誤，禍及公衆。須知抗戰殺×，生死爭于須臾，而建國大業，乃爲永久不磨之工作；若不繩以嚴明之紀律，豈能收成功之實效，故革命紀律，嚴格執行，卽爲抗戰精神之澈底振作，此實抗戰建國勝利成功之最大保陣，必須盡全力以實行者也。</p>
<p>大功只餘一簣　勝利終屬我人</p>
<p>本黨本于革命建國之歷史的使命，當國家民族危急存亡之秋，領導全民，毅然負荷，責任愈重，使命愈艱。凡我同志，務以至誠，遵守决議，一心一德，接受總裁提高黨德鞏固黨基本之指示，振作精神，集中意志，堅定信仰，充實能力，深入民衆，深入戰地，深入陷淪區域，深入下層鄉村。刻苦堅忍，以身作則，臨難必先，赴義恐後。以此精神，竭盡責職，亦以此精神，感孚中外。至我全國同胞，聞義或有後先，赴義當無二致。此次抗戰能堅持不移，百折不撓者，實爲我全國人民奮鬥不懈犧牲一切，以從事救國建國大業之偉續。今抗戰已入後期，大功只餘一簣，得道多助，世界之同情，已集于吾國，完成興復之大功，必歸于吾人。行見抗戰勝利之日期，在建國告成之會，願我全黨同志全國同胞，共隊斯意，悉力赴之！</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>五中全會宣言</h3>
<p>抗戰新階段中爲中外嚴重注視的國民黨五中全會，現經圖滿閉幕，并發表宣言。據路透社訊，這篇宣言特別強調國民黨歡迎在共同信仰三民主義下與其他任何政黨合作。回憶去年共產黨六中全會所鄭重提出的加強國共兩黨合作及請國民黨團結各抗日黨派建立民族聯盟的辦法，與此次國民黨五中全會宣言互相對照，使人深感我全國團結之更需鞏固，使人深感×奸挑撥離開陰謀之尚待澈底打破，始能保証中華民族抗戰必勝建國必成。我們願與全民同聲高呼「擁護五中全會團結全國堅持抗戰」的宣言！我們更願與全民同心協力「擁護國民黨與國民政府，大公無私，團結各黨，領導全國，肅淸失敗主義，肅淸漢奸親日份子，實行全部抗戰建國綱領，驅逐日本××，建立三民主義新中國！」</p>
<h3>響應國際反侵略大會</h3>
<p>昨（三十日）晚，希特勒發表演詞，準備幫助意大利在歐洲的發展：意大意更加緊一切進迫法國的軍事步驟，東方侵略者日本亦隨着歐局的嚴重而正在瘋狂策進遠東的大冒險。法西斯侵略者在英法妥協政策下面更瘋狂更公開的在燃放戰火了！</p>
<p>倫敦國際反侵略會適在此時召開大會，實有至重大的意義。我國各地民衆現已展開響應反侵略大會的運動，倫敦工程師四萬人亦準備在今天（卅一日）實行罷工示威，列隊前往唐甯街，請政府運軍火援助西班牙共和政府及抵制日貨援助中國，倫敦各工廠將爲之全部或局部停頓，這種消息使我們爲之歡躍！</p>
<p>我們希望以國際反使略大會開始，展開全世界各國民衆廣泛的反侵略運動，我們與論界文化界更應立刻擴大宣傳，並且鼓勵各友邦人民迅速展開統一戰線運動，用集體力量，用有效行動，來打擊妥協政策，來趕走法西斯侵略××！</p>
<h3>向印度及英國人民致敬！</h3>
<p>卅日倫敦路透社電訊，印度協會在此間舉行護護印度獨立的示威，參加的有倫敦印僑大部份及數千英國左翼份子。當塲通過决議案，要求抵制日貨及拒絕供給日本的一切物質與經濟，尤其是煤油與信用。並要求予西班牙以經濟及藥物援助。同時籲請英國進步勢力爲英印及其他殖民地人民謀取更密切的關聯。印度及英國進步份子此種行動，值得我們献致民族解放的最敬禮。</p>
<p>日本及德意侵略所予英國在遠東與歐洲的威脅，英國人士已經身受；目前印度大陸亦已爾入日本軍閱進攻計劃以內，英國印度和中國人民現已陷於同一命運，只有團結反抗法西斯侵略者才有生路，才有自由。印度近來在進步的民族領袖尼赫魯先生領導之下，實行反法西斯侵略的民族統一戰綫，對於世界人類與中印兩國人民，會盡最大努力。最近印度民族運動左翼領袖玻士被選爲全印度國民大會主席，更可見全印人民的共同意向，我們允應遙致敬意，並祝賀印度民族光榮的前途。</p>
<h3>印度同志會　議决排斥日貨　停供汽油及倍欵與日　謀英印人民密切聯繫　　【路透社倫敦廿九日電】印度同志會召開示威大會、在此間特拉法加廣塲舉行、其召集目的乃在援助印度之獨立、參加者有大部分印僑及數千名英國左翼份子、大會議决排斥日貨、特別是停止供給汽油及借欵與日、大會並盼能予西班牙以經濟沒醫藥援助、更主張「英國進步勢力應力謀英印與各殖民地人民間之密切聯繁」、新加坡軍事根據地概况  約翰根塞原著　（宏聲譯）　　新加坡軍事根據地，被稱爲新的直布羅陀，最近才完成，它是日本的「二十一條」所促成的，遠在一九一五年。日本向中國提出二十一條件，明白表示了日本將是英國在遠東的動×。　　一九一九年，約翰澤力科上將，就建議創立英國太平洋艦隊，以新加坡爲根據地，他主張，在遠東的海上除了巡洋艦以外，還要有戰鬥艦隊，他主張，英國應該確立一個「西半球」海軍政策。　　一九二一年，帝國會議在倫敦開會，把澤力科的建議考慮了一番之後，决定建築新加坡軍事根據地。到一九二二年，華盛頓海軍限制條約簽訂了，確立了列強間的海軍比率，同時英日同盟廢止。　　在這惆時候，英國國內的與論都說這一個新的軍事根據地是多餘的了，反而足以激怒日本引起他的疑懼之心，主持正義的人，更認爲這個新根據地，是對於華盛頓海軍條約的一種道德上的破壞行動，因爲華盛頓海軍條約裏，訂明禁止在經度一百十度以東，建築堡壘或海軍根據地，而新加坡距這一個限制地帶只有六度之遙。　　有一部份人甚至認爲英國有意搗蛋，不過這一說後來被正式否認了。根據地的建築工程是在一九二四年開始的，直至十五年以後—一九三八年二月十四日才全部告成。　　新加坡是一個島，二十七哩長，十四哩闊，有一條堤道跨佐和耳海峽與大陸相聯：位居馬來亞的頂點，到中國和日本的船隻都要在這裏轉向，恰好控制了東西交通的孔道，工作進行的時候，謠傳有人在進行間諜偵探活動，所以戒備甚嚴，警戒區裏的居民都勒令遷居，所有的建築工人，都打好手印。　　海軍根據地是在賽萊泰島的北岸，離新加坡市區約十二英哩，軍港正東不遠，便是空軍根據地，新加坡一共有三種設計：一種是英國陸軍起草的，一種是海軍起草的，一種是空軍起草的。所謂新加坡根據地，是包括這三者而言的。在理論上，遭一個根據地歸陸軍管轄，以杜弼大將爲統帥，他的職銜是駕乎駐新海軍與空軍一切官佐之上。　　建築的時候，須要遷山填河，共費了六百萬立方英尺的土方：至於填高低地沼澤，則費了八百萬立方英尺的土方，島的右方一望無際地列着無數白臘色的油筒，內藏一百萬噸汽油，每一只筒都鑄成茶托形，據說萬一有爆炸發生，這種形式的筒可以防止火燄的傳佈，地下都是軍火窖，儲藏之富，足使整個根據地化為織粉而有餘。　　海軍根據地共佔面積二十一方哩。他的主要點級品，是兩個巨大非凡的船渠，一個浮船渠，一個修理船渠，萬一海軍有所行動，船隻受損，卽使是最大的軍艦，也可以人渠修理，假便沒有新加披根據地，損壞的艦船必須一直到龐耳太去裝配，那時候裝好回來，戰爭也許已經結束了。　　這個浮船渠，長約九百英尺，寬約二百英尺，是世上第三個大浮船渠，它可以載負任何巨大的戰搖而依然上浮；底裏可以容六萬個人站立，這個船渠是在英國建造的。拆做幾部分從窩耳德拖到新加坡，計程一萬英哩，拖引的時候一共用八部荷蘭曳引機，爲現代海軍的偉觀之一。　　修理船渠較浮船渠略大，長約一千英尺：費六年工夫才完成，造價五百萬金元，用了四百五十萬立方英尺的混榮土。世界上任何船只都可以隨意安置，最近一次試騐，證明他可以容納六千八百萬加侖的水。　　那個浮船渠遇到必要的時候，可以遷移他處，例如香港修理船渠則不能移動，近兩個大船渠的地方，有機廠，電力廠，備藏倉庫以及一只蘇彝士運河以東最大的起重機。每一樣物件都是成雙的，除了起重機，所以×機來空襲時——假定他們衝得過防空綫——必須要做兩套頭工作哩。　　新加坡的唯一缺點是鄰近一帶有很多暗礁，使潛水艇的活動感到不便，不過×人的潛水艇一近新加坡，當然也要發生同樣困難。　　新加坡的空軍根據地，效率也是十分強大的，計有三個不同的軍用飛機楊和一個民用機場。民用機場是一九三七年六月裏開闢的，造價五百二十五萬美金，建築在海灣邊一塊新開堅的國地上，所以陸土與水上飛機可以一舉兩用。這一個機塲還有一點好處，就是離新加坡繁盛市區甚近，汽車只要七分鐘就可以到達。　　其中一個主要軍用機場，也有水陸空軍兩用的設備，水上飛機用的優良海面，計有二十英里之多，常駐在根據地的空軍不四下十大隊，必要時還可以從印度飛來增援。　　在技術上看來，新加坡實在是一個堅強的堡壘，平時駐軍七千，而更重要者，則是那些神秘的砲疊，以及許多砲台，散佈在新加坡島的極東端張巨地方，以及海峽中的許多小島上，這些小島上駐有許多砲兵隊與工程師。據說防禦工事中，不但包括二十五英里射程的十五寸口徑大砲，實際上還有世上最猛烈的十八寸口徑大砲。（未完）</h3>

<h3>戲劇大衆化的實踐</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>青年劇協聯合公演　希望他們在實踐與學習中生長起來</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>有熱有力的年靑朋友是可愛可敬的；雖然在他們的生長過程中，有時免不了發生「幼稚病」的傾向。然而，只要你踐到靑年隊伍看一下靑年新幹部活躍，挺進的姿態，你一定會讀嘆一聲「畢竟是後生可畏！」——尤其是在　廣大的，警覺的靑年羣，熱烈地，血誠地參加民族解放鬥爭的時候。</p>
<p>香港的靑年，×××××××，戲劇運動好像就是他們的精神與工作所寄托的地方。　着抗戰的炮聲所激盪，香港道小小的「××××」就風起雲湧般成立了大大小小二十幾個靑年戲劇團體，這個事　，是給我們恍然有所領悟的，而且在抗　戰線，增進工作效率的迫切要求之下，香港各靑年戲劇團體，居然携手起來，組織成一個統一的總組織，——港九靑年戲劇協會。這又是一個多麽快慰人意的消息！</p>
<p>該會為紀念×××及推動大衆劇運起見，就自前晚開始，假華南中學禮堂一連公演三夜公開招待民衆。記者於前天晚上，就充滿着興奮的心情前往參觀。佈景，招待，維持秩序，準備公演……胼手胝足，跳來走去，靑年男女活潑的表現，勾引起失了靑春的人們的囘憶。</p>
<p>幾百個觀衆把狹窄的禮堂裝得幾乎沒有空閒。演鬧的聲音直至開幕才靜寂起來。</p>
<p>向國旗行禮與為×××將士默念之後，主席就宣佈開會理由，說了一席戲劇應該配合抗戰以及靑年人應該團結的道理。最末還表示為執行集體主義的自我教育，希望來賓們，在他們演出後的檢討會中多多加以批判。這樣勇於求進的精神自然是值得我們的深予同情。</p>
<p>游藝開始，劈頭就是中華書局歌詠隊的歌詠。當中的「×××紀念歌」與一元還債運動歌」都是饒有意義而很動聽的新歌曲。</p>
<p>第一幕劇是紅白劇社的「熱血忠魂』；每個演昌都很認眞，落力。美中不足的地方是男女便衣隊員的聲音不够瞭亮。劇本是修改『最後一計』但還不如原劇本的緊張，沉痛。</p>
<p>第二幕是丁丑劇社的「××××」。××××××××××××，這是演昌技術相當成功的地方，結場表現×××××××，亦是很緊張。</p>
<p>幕後忙于佈置，幕前就由中華書局歌詠隊分成四小隊輪流出塲歌詠，努力與嚴肅的精神是不錯的，可是，人數太少，聲音却遠不如團體歌詠的雄壯。</p>
<p>唱追悼歌紀念抗戰殉難將士的時候，全場肅肅穆穆地站　致　。——用白骨築成凱旋之門，用鮮而灌開自由之花，多麽偉大的抗戰將土！</p>
<p>接着，第三幕又是開塲了，這是旋風戲社的「盲啞恨」。論劇本本身，以及演員技術，原都是很好的。可是，他們把劇本修改後，弄得與原來劇情頗有出入之處，反不及原作的好！</p>
<p>最末的一幕是蘆烽劇社的「重逢」。丁玲這個劇本是相當深刻的，測面與曲綫的新作風克服了國防劇本的公式化。演員的表情是够動人的，演出技術亦相當成熟，雖然是操着國語，全塲仍然是寂靜無聲，眞是使人太感動了。</p>
<p>就一般而論，四幕劇的演出都是相當地在水準之上，佈景簡單而且搖來動去，是共通的缺點，這怕亦是物質條件缺乏的緣故。聽說他們這次是每個劇團派出一二塊錢凑上來作最低限度的開銷，表現了這樣的成績，已經是難能可貴了。</p>
<p>這一晚，演至午夜十二時才盡歡而散。昨晚及今晚仍有繼續公演，並擬在劇　中推行一元還債運動。</p>
<p>經了這番演出之後，他們在實踐與學習中，一定會虛心地接受珍貴的教訓，而益加健壯地生長起來吧！</p>
<h3>婦女慰勞會　歡迎瓊僑代表</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>何香凝慷慨陳詞備致勗勉</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>是一个難得的盛會！昨天下午婦女慰勞分會，假座聖斯酒店，歡迎那羣不還千里從海外歸來的熱心的瓊僑代表，何香凝先生，孔院長的女公子令儀，和着瓊僑的什表……相繼激昂致詞，會塲百幾十張臉孔充滿了熱情，充滿了奮興！</p>
<p>時鐘纔打過四下，瓊僑的代表團，便魚貫的蒞臨。何香凝先生和陳銘樞的夫人早在堂子裏等候，起立含笑的招呼。老老少少，散亂的坐着客廳裏，間扮閒談，忽而人叢裏走出一位代表，請何香凝先生寫紀念冊。跟着你也寫他也寫，索性來一個總動員，把它密密的包圍起來。她一本一本的寫下去，與奮極了，當入座時，它兀自還握着毛睢，惹得大家都笑了！</p>
<p>長長的兩張桌子，覆着白的布，擺着鮮艷的花條。主席桌上宋子文先生的夫人張樂怡女士，和孔院長的女公子令，分據左右，何香凝先生居中策應，當中擺上了一束血紅的菊花，象徵着每個中華民族的好兒女為祖國而流着底碧血啊！</p>
<p>何香凝在那歡娛的空氣裏，微笑起立說：「瓊僑救國救鄉諸位熱心的同志，誰知道，中華還未建國時，海外僑胞，出錢出力推倒滿淸……僑胞實是開國功臣，謹先代表國內民衆，向熱心的僑胞致其萬二分的謝意！她頓了一頓繼續說下去：「今日外×憑凌中華民族的錦繡河山，慘遭蹂躪，國族存亡，在此一舉。希望僑胞更發揮舊有精神，踴躍起來，出財出力，帮助抗戰，帮助救護　兵，帮助救濟難民，帮助復興國家民族！」她一句比一句興奮，一句比一句誠懇，在熱烈的掌聲中，結束了她的演說。她喘着氣坐下來，各人都肝着她那黑色呢帽籠罩着的那幅慈露的臉孔！</p>
<p>跟着是孔院長的女公子令儀致歡迎詞，起初是很溫柔的說着，後來越說越興奮，興奮得臉兒都紅了。她鄭重地說明，我們抗戰的目的，不但要打退侵略我們的×軍，不但要恢復我已失掉的土地，同時要在這一次奮鬥中建立起一個光華燦爛獨立自由的新中華民國，因此我們不但要在×××××××××××××，同時也要在後方建設經濟生產，為國家立基礎。希望海外僑胞努力共同為國家出綫出力。她說起來層次不紊，一句句淸楚流利的流入座上人的耳裏，使人內心的熱血陣陣的奔流。</p>
<p>接着甘介侯夫人用流暢而又動聽的口吻報告了慰勞會在港工作的大概情况之後，繼着由何艾齡傳士申述兒童保育會的宗旨，和近來的情况，幷機席請各人到院內參觀訓練這羣未來的國家主入翁。</p>
<p>僑團的代表莊松起立演說，他首先說：「我們身在海外，但內心無一日不在懸念祖國的」。短短兩句話，刻出僑胞對祖國的熱情。興奮地繼續着說下去：「我們這次囘去，掌更對海外僑胞廣事宣傳，努力不懈，以達到最後勝利為止。」迫迫的掌聲截斷了他的話……末了何香凝起立補充着說：「諸位這樣的熱心、我相信將來一定是抗戰必勝，建國必成的」。他輕快地笑了一笑，跟着說：「謂諸位回去對僑胞說不必恢心、我們勝利是有很大的把握的。』說到這事她竟然跳起來，呼吸喘得很利害，大家聽了，都挺直了腰，熱烈地鼓起掌來，他透了透氣繼續說道「我們英美法蘇中國各民主國家要聯成一條陣綫，我相信一定可以壓倒法西斯蒂一定得到了勝利」，他伸張了兩手，拳兒握得更緊了！</p>
<p>最後由瓊僑的代表報告星洲那邊的工作情形，他說「看見了這邊的救亡工作的緊情形，心裏非常高興。不過星洲那邊×貨已掃淸了，香港這邊的工作，似乎還做得不大啊够！」</p>

<h3>我×知識青年的對比　—郭沫若在復大的演講—</h3>
<p>【慶航訊】政治部第三廳廳長郭沐若氏應復旦大學之請、在該校講演「×我智識靑年的對比」、郭先生很少作公開講演的時候、尤其對於靑年方面的題目、自然是難得的機會、</p>
<p>當吳南軒校長伴着郭先生踏進裏外滿擠了復旦學生的大教室的時候、一陣熱烈掌聲將郭先生迎上講台、吳校長幾句簡切的介紹詞後、郭先生便在「知己知彼百戰百勝」的話語之下、開始了他的講題</p>
<p>「因為×國的教育方針一向注重教育衛生準備週全、在那自然環境裏、一般說來、日人受了先天的健全、和後天的修養、體格都比我們健強……」郭先生首先將×我靑年的體俗作了一個概說、給了我們一個警惕、　　他又說明了日本不論大中小學除有體育課程之外、幷有各種游藝部門（如騎馬射箭等）、強迫學生選習、此外冬天有「寒稽古」—冷水沐浴、暑天有海水浴、日本靑年受了這些鍛鍊、已將我們稱呼的「倭子」長高起來了、</p>
<p>同時郭先生更以我國參加遠東和世界運動會失敗的事實作了一個具體的証明、可是日本人是在獎勵體育、勇往邁進、而我們却事事馬虎不求努力、便落伍下去、　　但求智力來說、我們不但比日人超越、而且佔世界第一位、曾經德國學者康拿的研究結果、中國人之頭腦比諸一般白種人黑種人容量為大、以一千五百CC以上的容量來說、中國人佔百分之卅二、歐美人百分之廿七、黑種人及南洋土人則百人之中無一人、反之在一千二百CC容量之下的頭腦、我國最少而黑人最多、　　由此看來、日人雖為黃種、而血統複雜、遠不如我們、以我國留學生成績相較、亦大多超過他們、只是因為我們自負聰明、不去努力、而日人則能經長久時間去研究一種學科、因了他具有這種精神、反強過我們、首先接受西洋文明、可是日人的發展是拋物線的、甚麼東西達到頂點就會減退的、　　日人的進步、現在怎麽樣呢、　　自「九一八」發動侵我戰爭後、日本盡量征兵、已將她的靑年們的身體和精神壓迫墮落下去、使靑年日暮窮途、不能正常的發展、佔大多數的性病流行、便是明證、甚至到處「色情狂」、且有男裝女扮者出現街頭、　　「九一八」以後雖經×政府禁止靑年學生出入咖啡店跳舞塲，嚴禁左派讀物、規定學生讀聖經、佛教、結果不但未如所願、學生們反而爭讀「婦女雜誌」「明星畫報」、其銷路之廣、雖四大金剛之中央公論、改造、日本評論、文藝春秋等亦望塵莫及、可見用此消極方法、實不能制止日本齊年之苦悶和隨落、日本文化的下降、當然「歸功」於她侵華的結果、　　現在我們以中日兩國比較、無疑的、日本文明已達到最高峯、是到下降的時候了、同時我們為了衛土而戰、為了人類幸福、為了世界和平、已促進我們的發展、將過去的缺點漸漸拋去、且靑年注意鍛鍊身體、深知非健全身體不能祖任目前重大任務、饅高領袖亦指示正確途徑、所謂「學生生活應以士兵生活作單位」以為來日效命疆塲之基礎、我國靑年體魄日益健強、正是民族復興的起點、</p>
<p>至於精神方面，因鑒於過去失敗在馬虎、目前情勢告訴我們要奮發有為、需要專一的學識、在充實後方生產的口號下、如果沒有科學研究、怎樣充實呢、軍用武器亦要配合科學方法才能連用靈活、所以第一期抗戰中、最高領袖說的「專技重於博學」、就是這原因、</p>
<p>如今我們受着時代的需要、客觀的需要、便促進了主觀的努力、就是說日本靑年本強於我們、但為侵者之結果、精神身體均頹廢失敗、中國靑年則因抗戰關係日益前進、這巳是目前顯明的事實、</p>
<p>最後、郭先生很明白地告訴大家、要不斷地努力、在最高領袖指導之下、抱定民族復興之决心、用眞實才學貢獻國家、則抗戰必勝、建國必成、我國的文化必會為世界放一異彩、（本淵）</p>
<h3>李宗仁夫人談　婦女動員</h3>
<p>— 志淵</p>
<p>【重慶航訊】在一問家具很簡單、也很陳舊的大客廳裏、會見李宗仁夫人郭德潔女士、由老友尊一女士介紹之後、三人便各自選擇適當的位子坐下、記者叩問廣西婦女在抗戰中的情形、她很謙和地、操着廣西官話、慢慢說道、「廣西、因為貧窮、一般人的生活在戰前就很淸苦、在戰時、自然是更加可憐了、尤其是婦女，她們很少有能享受到所謂太太們的優裕生活的、可是她們並不抱怨、而且還和男人們取着同一的步伐、在積極地參加抗戰工作」、</p>
<p>「廣西的婦女抗戰工作、比較起來、還算普遍、各學校的女生、各機關的女公務員、自然是義不容辭地參加子最直接的工作、如在前綫當女兵、做看護等等、廣西的女學生軍至今己畢業了兩班、共一千餘人、她們現都分散在前綫工作。她們的成績很不錯、有好些地方、使我們的軍隊和老百姓打成了一片、獲得了不少的幫助、還有、在前綫、有好幾次我軍迫于×人猛烈的砲火、想要退却、但女學生軍們堅持要與陣地共存亡、男將士們受了她們的激勵、一鼓作氣、不單是沒有退却、而且還打了勝仗、」</p>
<p>一口氣說下去、越說越興奮，原來是很莊重的臉上漸漸露出了笑容、</p>
<p>「家庭婦女、普通是較難動員的、但在廣西的村街組織中、家庭婦女是和男人們一樣、被吸收了進去、所以政府有命令、只要達到村街組織、婦女們不用特別號召就起來了、過去她們的工作是製棉衣、募獻金等、在募捐獻金這一工作下、她們眞盡了很大很大的力量、數目是四萬多、這、在富裕之省算不了什麼，但在廣西、不能不算是一個驚人的數字哩！」</p>
<p>說到這裏、才停了下來、微笑着、記者忙提出第二個問題就是「如何才能發動全數的婦女來參加抗戰</p>
<p>他點了點頭、毫不遲疑地回答、「我以為一切的事都離不開政治、所以動員婦女若能加幾分政治的力量上去、効率是要比較大得多、可是、我不是說婦女處在被動的地位、而是要婦女有政權、自己來推動自己、現在省、市、縣參議會要成立了、但這當中、聽說是不要婦女的、其實這正是一個發動廣大歸女的一個機構。婦女們有什麼意見、有什麽辦法、都有貢献的機會、同時就可以縣參議會的女參議員為發動一縣、一村或一街的婦女的中心、我們旣可訴說我們本身的要求、獲得生活的改良、一方面又可在以民衆的意見來决定的種種原則下工作、我相信這樣做來、也許要迅速得多、」</p>
<p>「是的、有的人說、英國的婦女原來沒有參政權、可是歐戰以後、因了婦女工作的成績表現得很好、政府便自動地給了她們參政權了、中國的婦女不妨仿倣、可是、我不以為然、因為中國抗戰與歐戰不同、我們應當吧所有的民族力量、都掘發出來、以爭取抗戰的勝利、中國婦女參政、其意義幷不止婦女參政權、而是在抗戰中貢献婦女自己力量的一種方式……」</p>
<p>李夫人又接着說：「好像一個人、他只用右手、把左手廢棄不用、這八能做大的工作嗎？婦女佔了全國人口的半數、而且若抗戰持久下去、後方的一切、都要婦女出來担負、婦女如能參加地方政權、直接推動婦女工作、効率不是更大嗎？」</p>
<p>她想了想：「自然、婦女要想提高自己的政治地位、等別人來给、或只喊口號、貼標語、都是無用的、我們要努力、要團結、協力同心、互相帮助、才有希望！」</p>

<h3>湘桂紀行</h3>
<p>— 帥雨蒼</p>
<p>一　湘潭雜寫</p>
<p>湘水發源廣西的海陽山、與離水合流至與安縣委蛇東北入零陵、合瀟水、更入衡陽、合蒸水、這便是所謂三湘、三湘北流長沙而入洞庭湖、每在夏秋季候、水勢旺大、溯水而上、便可直達源流、再下江、水運交通稱便、這本是湖南省最大的河流、</p>
<p>湘潭位在三湘之濱、為湖南省的一大城市、商業繁盛、交通便利、浙贛粵漢兩鐵路的交會點、便在該縣所屬的株州鎮、當浙贛路未成時期、由東西萍鄉至株州原有萍株鐵路、蓋萍鄉產煤甚豐、其輸出係由萍株路而轉水浮至洞庭湖、再入長江的、關於該縣沿革、查縣志載稱、「南朝梁置、隋因之、故城在令湖攸縣西北、唐徙今治、淸屬湖南長沙府、今屬湘江道、地當湘水之曲、水量形勢、利於泊舟、」這可概見湘潭是湘江航行的要點了、</p>
<p>湘潭街市、以總為別、雖然也有定名三民路、中山街等、但事實上乘坐街車時、祗須說明上第幾總反較上某某街為易於明瞭、因為勞動階級人們還常沿用着德稱、所謂一總者約一華里地、那農最繁盛的是街市、由九總、至上八總、十里長街、商肆林立、高敞洋樓、舉凡百貨商店茶館旅舍俱齊、而尤以樂舖檳榔行為多、因湘人嗜檳榔、即妙齡女郎躑躅街衢、亦啣嚼不己、以檳榔能健胃齒而利尿腸、但其味甚澀、不如嚼臘、</p>
<p>旅舍較為著稱者則為十一總之九閣香、十三總之兩湖旅社、十五絢之萬國旅社、房價約在一元至三元不等、並均兼營糖菓食品及酒菜、最高層則為屋頂坪臺、設座售茗、每當皓日東昇、皎潔的光茫交織着深黃無力的電炬光、這電炬光煞似訴說着他們營業的萧條暗淡與悽慘、因為長沙株州葉家灣、屢被狂炸、這裏白天裏也空襲警聲頻傳、有閒階級都似驚弓之烏、安樂的享受、當然大減聲色、所以坪臺景色是素衣玄裳花技招展的女招待、、祇是串挿在休養的受傷兵佐之間、普通人們僅占少數而巳、但是營業暗淡由其暗淡、希望這暗淡中求到一線光明來資養生命的却日見增多、在這些坪臺上常有幾位年靑的姑娘提着皮包販賣着花露水爽身粉等化妝品、舉止大方、言詞溫文、不類一般商人、在她們向顧客的自供裏知道是安徽蕪湖的流亡者、難途生活、不得不做些賣買、但當她們每向人衆要求交易時提包常是滿載而來、滿載而去、却落得幾位老向的一聲愛莫能助、</p>
<p>關於湘潭的交通線、也有幾條值得注意的、記述如后、　　（一）畏潭公路—由湘潭至長沙每晨六時起機有公共汽車往返開行、每次八十五分鐘到達、日有六班、票價一元、乘坐須先渡江至湘潭東站候車、</p>
<p>（一）長衡公路—由湘潭至衡陽每日、開車一次、乘坐須先渡江至下攝司站候軍、</p>
<p>（一）長潭與潭衡航程——長潭每日互有小輪最少往返各一艘、價票每人四角、臥鋪另加四角、約四小時到達、潭衡間現祇到株州、每日祇互開一艘、票價亦為四角、　　潭宜航程——由湘潭往湖北宜昌、約一周開行小輪一次、票價九元四角、臥舖另加四元七角、十歲左右孩童免票、四日到達、</p>
<p>二　陽巡禮</p>
<p>潭衡交通工具、原有輪船、火車、汽車、但在此抗戰時期、以武漢長沙的疏散人口、及株州等處車站被炸、行李較多者旅行諸感不便，於是我們這次來衡不得不甯用最為遲笨的民船了、湘潭的船埠本規定九總為永州碼頭、十三總為長沙碼頭、十四總為株州碼頭、十五總為衡州碼頭、十六總為祁陽碼頭、我們僱到民船、計費一星期的時間、先行委託住衡州碼頭的王老板代找、計中號船兩條言定船價每條法幣二十二元、主老板者乃僱船的攔兒手、僱定後另給酬勞三元、在月兒淡淡的晚上下了船、醒來時這是一個已凉天氣未寒時的拂曉、微微的北風吹動了萬條金蛇的江面、十多條船隻張起風帆啓碇了、湘船遷艙特矮、時日雖已秋大、每在上午十時至下午四時之間、艙中悶熱、簡直到達沸點、而行程速率每天祇行二十至三十里、</p>

<h3>船務特訊</h3>
<p>忌連航業公司之忌連昂號、（本港代理為渣甸公司）今日午間可由歐抵港、是輪為該公司最近訂進八艘新輪中之一、各情經誌前報、查該輪是次首先開航東來、抵港後將泊太古會橋、一俟貨牧卸淸、即行開往上海、日本等埠、至其餘七艘、除在本港太古船塢訂造之兩艘外、餘仍在英趕造中云、</p>
<p>泰生輪船公司之交通號、昨已修理完竣、今夕可出塢、駛泊碼頭、明日照常航行港澳、查該輪自入場後、其原日行走時間、則由濠江號暫代、惟據該公司消息、謂因最近港澳航綫、先後加入數艘行定、交通號是次出塢、將來行走時間、為避免互相抵觸，對原日航期、或將略為變更云</p>

<h3>為今春茶產銷籌改進（續）</h3>
<p>— 謝耀原</p>
<p>惟有縮減營業範圍、則間接機足以使生產量減小、此實非荼業發展前途之福、貿會實施管理製茶廠而後、製茶廠合夥人間責任關係機可確立、經過驗資之後資本額亦可予以證明、而提高製茶廠對外之信用、一方面更組織銀團、募集資金、貸與製茶廠、使週轉得以裕如、同時、合製茶廠互為擔保、互為監督、如是製茶廠間之關係亦可趨於密切、彼此休戚相共、而消除以往畛域之見也，</p>
<p>調整人事、此為貿會內部之問題、本無合置喙，惟在實施上述二端時、則機構龐大、非有嫻熟該業情形、學識經騐兩皆豐富之人員專任其事、殊不足以竟全功、貿會統制茶葉運銷、當以發展茶業為重、其虛懷若谷、延納該業中優秀人士、充任重要職務、或亦因事制宜之所需、而茶商與貿會間之情感、亦可藉以溝通、茶業發展欣欣充滿生機、國家財源固可增加、茶農茶商亦兩受其惠庶以免與民爭利之護、而努力目標合一之餘、茶農茶商當亦能知所努力焉、　　嚴定檢驗標準、茶葉檢騐、本為提高國茶對外信用、但茶葉因銷胄不同、製做方法亦有所異、理論須與事實兼顧、如着色茶之取締、則商人一方須遵守法令、而他方為求適應需要該項之消費市場起見、着色、在製做上自感有甚大之困難、而改製無色之茶以後、產量自之是减少矣、檢騐茶葉職務因行施、雖不為貿會所主管、貿會應促使檢驗機關與茶商保持適當之接觸、採擇茶商若干意見、改進其檢驗技衛、此亦為發展茶葉所宜注意者也、</p>
<p>協助商人採辦製造上之用品、戰時交通困難、而某種貨物又有不能進口之法令限制、茶商製造茶葉必之須用品、如色料、洋釘、靑鉛、箱板等等、採購有時甚苦週折、此種用品為茶葉製做過程上不可缺、貿會應協助商人採辦、予以運輸上之便利、或指定專營機關、使無流弊、實於茶商經營上受益良多、</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>貿會於統制茶業切實改進、則統制愈為嚴密、機構愈為靈活、上下努力、茶業發展，必有可望、然筆者與、商接談、茶商每鰓鰓過慮、不乏于統制茶業將有所反對態度者、此實為未明統制之效用、與夫偏重一已之利益、非為整個茶業圖發展也、卽若去年、茶商在貿會未統制連銷之前、獲利似甚有可觀、然一析其獲利之原因、則由於外匯之暴宿使然、倘以折合外幣、售價固未曾絲毫提高也、此種投機性之獲利、自是例外、不能視為正常、我國茶業衰落已久、茶展茶商創痛極深、今當方有轉機、力量稍充、亟應猛省悟、與貿會誠摯合作、以改進統制、力求復興、筆者自於此、寄以無限之希望也（完）</p>

<h3>滬中西慈善籃球賽　首戰混合勝麥令　開球成問題延長比賽　最後結果廿八比廿分</h3>
<p>【上海通訊】上海難民救濟會主辦之中西慈善籃球賽、混合戰麥令、首戰昨廿五晚八時在中靑籃球房揭幕、在極度緊張之形勢中、混合卒於最後八分鐘中、冲破沉悶局面、以二十一比十九獲得勝利、後因麥令抗議、延長比賽五分鐘、大局急轉、混合勢如破竹、結果二十八比二十分大勝、上半時各得十分、未分勝負、觀衆樂善好施、球房宣告客滿、約計來賓六百餘人、混台集百樂門華聯國光之精銳、麥令則為紅金兩隊之合成、勢均力敵不啻申報盃中美慈善賽之重演、惟麥令則缺少海賊健將、實力當較美國隊為遜、混合隊之勝利、實為應有之結果、</p>
<p>值得慶幸</p>
<p>昨晚之戰局、沉悶僵持、直全最後八分鐘、才見打破、混合隊雖一再變更陣綫、合作上始終難達理想中之程度、表演殊見慌張、投籃因亦不準、局勢幾全在麥令控制之下、分數一再平等、相差亦常常一二分之間、混合鬱鬱不得志、麥令之攻勢、則猛而不息、幸而麥令不價用中靑廣大之場地、數十投籃機會、皆未命中、練慣西靑之小塲、球皆拋擲太近、用力稍欠把握、否則混合早已殆矣、最後大局急轉、亦為意想不及、令人慶幸、第二場比賽、混合必能更上一層、各個表演、則當推孫惠培也、</p>
<p>臨時協定</p>
<p>由奚玉書君用中英文報告、向各方道謝後、袁履登代表虞洽卿開球、洽老小恙、擬於紛獎時到塲、六秩壽翁拋擲第一隻球、球為周達雲得、急傳陳學崇、一轉身巳送入籃內、於是休息時麥令抗議、謂開球混合係得袁氏派司、於是雙方議定、如結果相差二分、須延長五分鐘、更决勝負、事有湊巧、結果適為二十一比十九、混合多二分、乃延長五分鐘、混合乘勢一衝、連得七分、終以二十八比二十大勝、</p>
<p>打成僵局</p>
<p>混合第一陳綫、在沈昆南君指揮之下、先以周達雲李震中陳學崇孫惠增蔡演雄登場、麥令則淸一色之麥令紅、陳學崇旣首先中的、蔡演雄之半場遠射、大受衆賞、周達雲機之立功、蔡又罰中、如此混合頓時以七比零大佔優勢、麥令鎭靜不亂、連罰帶中、立時扳囘四分、祥龍急調出李震中、不能過麥令勢，薩琴脫派曼爾反以八比七超出、混合形勢甚為不佳、合作格格不入、全在麥令炮彈之下、達雲罰中成各八、慕爾復造十比八、此時麥令以全隊全體登塲、兩方造就極少、上半時成各十平手、</p>
<p>春雲開展</p>
<p>下半時孔廣益調出周達雲、麥令仍為全隊、又成拉鋸戰、麥令失機累累、混合急調李震中入替孔廣益、果然形勢一振、祥龍之一擲、以十四比十三佔先一分、麥令紅隊又全體登塲、達雲亦入代祥龍、戰局突然如春雲開展、蔡李及學崇速袂建功、造成二十比十五及二十一比十七之極對優勢、不料薩琴脫之一擲、成二十一比十九、延長五分鐘、此最後五分鐘、混合予麥令以措手之機會、大貓先罰中、演雄半場一擲、兩人再各加二分、麥令僅勃倫脫二罰一中、結果成二十八與二十之比、</p>

<h3>招軍買馬</h3>
<p>漢英英皇校友排球隊、自響應記者排球義賽後、卽整軍經武、秣馬勵兵、該隊鑒於實力仍未充實、以戰事在邇、為應付起見、除加緊訓練外、更招軍買馬、號召舊日袍澤、如遠運健兒盧康元、伍灼榴、全運代表李振、李錦祺、源炳球、均出為効力、而歐陽紹棠、亦參加出戰、最近陳世昌、亦有意加入戰團、該隊現目實力、頗為雄厚、一俟决賽有期、卽先約各友軍週旋云、</p>
<h3>最適宜女子的運動</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>至於徒手體械、器械運動、游泳、步行、騎自行車、網球、鉅射、籃球、曲棍球、舞踏、划獨木舟、高級富球、射箭、騎馬、駕駛、滑雪、溜冰以及鷄毛球等運動、為潮度、對於女子都很有益、</p>
<p>總之、如運動過度、無論那一種運動都不宜於女子、所以、運動時應極力避免過度疲乏等現象、運動過度的弊害更甚於缺乏運動、對於女子最有效的運動就是需要「氣」即耐力、而在「力」的方面却取緩和的運動、</p>
<p>徒手體操、器械運動和游泳於女子可說是最理想的運動、步行也是一種最好的戶外運動、對于增進健康實有很大的功效、關於田徑賽、除了撑竿跳高和擲鐵鎚之外、如一方面採用適當的設備、一方面不至行之過度、如此、鍛練體格、使身體平均發達為目的、注重運動的姿勢、並不測重於勝負或成績、這樣對子女子也很適宜、</p>
<p>撑竿跳高之所以不適合於女子、就是因為當身體落地時必須受重大的打擊、對於身體內部的器官有很大的影饗、同樣的理由、跳高、跳遠甚至賽跑等運動、如祇測重於勝負或成績、而忽略了運動的姿勢、對於女子是否適宜、尚為疑問、</p>
<p>網球、游泳等運動雖然最適宜於女子、但如她們的身體構造和精神上的特質不適合於這種運動、則不可勉強從事這種運動、她們須根據各人身體不同的構造和精神上的特質來選擇她們的運動、然後加以適當和謹慎的指導、按步就班、下疾不徐逐漸進步、這樣她們對於她們的運動就有堅决的恒心、能積極從事於這種運動、對於她們的健康、她們的身體和她們的精神、能力等等之重要也能有深切的認識、</p>
<p>女子對於運動、如欲收獲最大的效果、必須細心研究她自己與她所選探的運動的關係、</p>
<p>除了徒手體操和器械運動之外、普通所謂最適宜於女子的運動，並不適宜於每個女子、徒手體操和器械運動不僅適宜於每個女子、並且功效也滾在任何運動之上、但是欲牧獲最大的效果、必須一方面從事徒手體操和器械運動、一方面在各種適宜於女子的運動中、再選擇一種適合各人心身的通動、（完）</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>娛樂……太傻特傻</p>
<p>Beau　Hunks</p>
<p>是數年前勞萊哈台的作品、現在新拷貝重行公映、在所有勞萊哈台的作品中、這一部的成績、差是稍差點、片不很長、內容也不甚豐富、片中胖孑哈台失意、傷心之下、索性投軍、被派往菲洲、在某一次沙漠行軍、他兩人迷失了路途、却因此救了一個受土人國困的孤城、勞萊哈台保持着一貫的作風、所製作的笑料、還足够觀衆大笑一塲、</p>
<p>平安皇后……巴黎蜜月</p>
<p>Parfs　Honeymoon</p>
<p>故事很簡單、所有塲面全靠各演員的支撐、演出尚輕鬆可喜、演員陣容相當齊整、可惜演員的支配不甚適合、一部份的演員未能儘展其所長、</p>
<p>故事叙述一個美國西部的百萬闊少、帶着未婚妻到巴黎、因為未婚妻在那里、尚得和舊夫辦妥離婚手續、他便先到一個玫瑰鄉村小住、在那里却遇到當地的玫瑰花后、一個時時叫他麻煩、他呌她「小頭痛」的小姑娘、在無意中發生戀愛，同時他的未婚妻在巴黎、却和舊夫重溫好夢、他便和那玫瑰花后結婚、</p>
<p>片中有動聽歌曲數闋、由萍克勞斯貝唱、秀蘭露絲和愛德華霍登、在片中沒甚戲做、愛金譚密洛夫、這個以演反角出名的明星、在這里充當諧角、成績也很不差、弗蘭西絲嘉嘉演出活潑而優秀、</p>
<p>東方……瑞士小姐</p>
<p>Swiss　Miss</p>
<p>故事很簡單、寫兩个個賣老鼠夾的商人（勞萊、哈台）、他們忽然異想天開到瑞士去做生意、可是非但生意不曾做着、結果還要罰在旅館裏做侍者、兩个自作聰明的獃子、就鬧了不少笑話、</p>
<p>這裏面有二個歐洲的歌唱家、尤其是那位女的、有很好的歌喉、勞萊、哈台演出與以前的作品沒有什麽兩樣、</p>
<p>大華……同歌共舞</p>
<p>Everybody　Sfng</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫主演、她的歌喉雖然不及狄安娜竇萍來得動人、可也是新人中傑出的人才了、本書內容是寫一個戲劇狂的家庭、演出方面一切都編重在喜劇與歌舞、也是一般好萊塢歌舞片的彩色、裘蒂珈倫除歌唱之外、表情也不差、亞倫瓊斯却沒有像「情韻動軍心」裏那樣出色、</p>
<p>新世界……眞假武則天</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>一部想利用香艷肉感作為號召的商品、是以一生本性奇淫的舞台紅伶作為個片的中心人物、而以她在舞台上飾演武則天、和荒淫的私生活、作為描寫材料、怪誕不經的內容、但可能的迎合低級趣味、儘所謂香艷肉感的場面、也未敢澈底、徒令「鹹遇」觀衆失望、普通觀衆肉麻而已、</p>
<p>中央……金葉菊續集</p>
<p>粵語片</p>
<p>看過上集的觀衆、總記得在結局時、金葉菊仍被周志誠偷去一對、現在績集中就從追事講起、到金葉菊歸還為止、劇情無上集緊張而曲折、演來亦非常鬆懈、但禮中間仍有不少地万能博得一部份愚笨觀衆的眼淚、如鄺山笑之被害而入獄、小燕飛之探監等、民間故事一貫的作風、還是不能避免、我們不需要看過、就能猜到該片劇情、果然這理想並不錯誤、曹綺文不適宜演這積影片、佈景攝影在華南尚可以過去、收音却是失敗的、</p>
<p>太平……粵劇</p>
<p>太平男女劇團</p>

<h3>愛麗絲馬寶兒的網球登龍秘法（六）</h3>
<p>— 球場舊侶</p>
<p>高壓為為女子最難學的手法、凡能作高壓的女子、手法必出於天賜、故能作高壓的女子、實少之而又少、原因是女子的動作、根本是比男子來得慢、這是天生的缺憾、女子之所以難有高壓的手段、就是因為慢之一字、而常使高球跌得過低時乃壓出的原故、</p>
<p>高壓的打法雖然似與發球法無異、但準備發球時、球拍是必應繞到身後去的、若準備高壓、便不然了、當你見有必須施展高壓的還擊時、你在你對手將球打出時、便把球拍高高舉起作為準備、同時脚下也宜用細步略向前進、尤宜側身而前、到要打出時、才把球拍向後垂下、然後向天發動、向前打出、但打出時切忌有意將球壓低、</p>
<p>照我打球的手法、大綱可分別如下、這不啻是我賽球的十戒、</p>
<p>「一」在對方發球而我準備還擊時、應盡量立近在底線處、因為如此便可助自己有迅速的準備、</p>
<p>「二」你繞拍向後、準備迎擊的時侯、應在來球剛要脫離你的對賽者的球拍時期、</p>
<p>「三」進退宜用細碎之步法、「切忌大步跑」、</p>
<p>「四」在比賽時、足下應永不停留而常須跳動、如此你方不愁有發動太遲之弊</p>
<p>「五」在未賽前之練習時問、即應偵探與你對賽者的弱點、</p>
<p>「六」應常注目於你對賽者所發出之球不少瞬、同時也應常注目於一己打出之球、</p>
<p>「七」在塲盡處打球後、應立時走回底綫與開球界之中點處、</p>
<p>「八」當發球時、如第一球未能過網、則第二球應再擲高一點、如果第一球被擊出界、則第二球應擲前一點、</p>
<p>「九」應視打網球為一極娛樂品、勝固欣然、敗亦可喜、勝敗俱應表露同等禮貌、</p>
<p>「十」應出之以繼續之舉動、「完」</p>

<h3>勿中奸計</h3>
<p>— 杜埃</p>
<p>從報紙上知道西班牙政府發明了一種宣傳的利器，名字叫做「宣傳炮」。利用炮彈力量，把傳單散落到叛軍的隙地上去。不久以前，在一本畫刊上又看見了西班牙的政府軍，有在陳地上專負責對叛軍進行播音宣傳的鬥士。這兩種工作，對于瓦解叛軍力量，會起了重大的作用。這是值得找們學習的。</p>
<p>與代的戰爭，不僅是槍炮戰爭，同時也是政治的宣傳戰爭。這道理是人人曉得的。我們這次抗戰，是為着眞理正義而戰，宣傳戰之更須要提高其幼能，也早日被人感到的了。然而，却有一部份的宣傳鬥士，缺乏政治常識，缺乏警惕性時時宣傳了一個相反的結果，出來。</p>
<p>我們中國的報紙，似乎還有一部份脫不了「有聞必登」的老方法，只求其「有聞」或者「多閒」，而个求其「確實與否」，至不究共「聞」的來源，更不估計新聞刊出之後，會得到一個什麽樣的結果。像這類的報紙，是最易於落敵人的圈套的。譬如拿蘇聯出兵來說。蘇聯對我們的援助，是根據我們客觀需要而援助的。我們抗戰所需要蘇聯帮助的，是現代化的軍械，技術人員等等，而不是需要蘇聯的「大兵」。蘇聯在其複雜的國際關係下，出兵援助中國不是一個簡單的問題。蘇聯單獨出兵援在助中國，也不是予我們怎樣有利的。。因為出兵而引起西方法西國家的進攻，則蘇聯對我們的帮助，反而要受影響。日本人是知道這道理的。因此他便極力宣傳「蘇聯即將出兵援助中國」，他這種宣傳有三方面的作用，一是對中國。把中國人都哄得高興起來。但結果蘇聯並沒有出兵。於是又使中國人對蘇聯失望了，甚至怨恨起蘇聯來了，罵她「不够朋友」。日本通訊社用這樣的技倆，來離開中蘇日益增進的關係。二是對國際。它對國際宣傳「蘇聯將向中國出兵了」，「中國將亦化了」等等的謊言，來轉移國際視綫，使世界各民主國家對中國疑忌，從而挑撥中國與各民主國家的感情，使我團國際地位獨立。三是對日本國內。它可借蘇聯出兵的「風浪」，「更有理由」的向其國民搜刮，及更大規模抽調軍隊來華，增強其對我們的新的軍事進攻。這就是日本通訊社及其助手某國通訊社之特別喜歡偽造「蘇聯出兵」，「加倫將軍飛抵重慶」等謠言的陰謀。我們一部份的報紙不加分析，也同樣的大登特登起來。其影嚮如何呢？人民失望了，日本進攻更凶猛了，人民對抗戰也就更悲觀了，於是，某大報的社論「責備」蘇聯的文章出現了，×方的通信社的職們員，就成功似的大笑起來。像遺類事情雖然是「已成過去」。但我們的報紙編輯，就該記取這些經驗和教訓才好。</p>
<p>再舉一個例子吧？當廣州失陷不久以後，日本的通訊社及和×國勾結的某通訊社，突然放出「蔣委員長限十一月十四日前克復廣州」的消息。其實廣州的克復，是要在一定的條件之下，才能達到的。我們並不是斤斤於克復「廣州」一地的問題，目前的主要任務，還是如何停止×之向西北江的進攻及如何將環繞廣州的各城市奪囘來，並在敵後方發動游擊戰，使×人困處廣州一隅，然後時機一到，（這就是說在一定的條件之下）廣州克復是不成問題的。×人明知這點，他知道我們目前還未能馬上克復廣州，於是他就故意放出一個謠言，說是「蔣委員長限令」云云。等到十一月十四日廣州還未克復的事實擺明出來的時候，×人及其帮兇者就又會心的笑了。×人的這種謠言，也有兩個陰謀，一，故意放出空氣，以達到某種政治作用。二，引起廣東人民某種悮解。我們的報紙不加詳組分析，也照樣的大登特登，「蔣委員長限一禮拜克復廣州。」</p>
<p>上述的經驗與教訓是沒有改正過來，而我們的報紙（一小部份）却又在鬧笑話了。譬如本日廿六有些報紙就大登特登海通社的「中共取銷邊區，交還八路軍」等消息。其實西北邊區袛是中央政府下面的一個地方政府，它是統一戰綫底下的一單位。邊區政府要取消，那麼各省地方政府也該取銷了。這豈非好笑。至於八路車，它是由紅軍改編成國民革命軍第十八集團軍的，它之歸最高指揮部統轄，己不是今天才開始的。那麼海通社的宣傳作用又在那里呢？我想我們試看汪精衛去年十二月卅日的通電男所說的那套故意破壤國共合作取銷統一戰綫戕害抗戰前途的建議就明白。而這又恰恰日本法西斯挑撥國共合作，破壞統一戰綫的新技倆。</p>
<h3>一件日本人所不懂的事</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>從某日文雜誌新年號的一篇小說裏，偶然讀到一段很有趣味的故事。大意是這樣的：</p>
<p>在前屆日本會議裏，有一位議員前來質問政府說，日本是戰勝國，中國是戰敗國，照道理，日本錢在國際匯兌的市價上，必較中國錢食才是。那知道事實却過得其反：中國幣的市價却比日幣貴得多：每百元可換日幣一百十餘元。這不是怪現象嗎？問政府這是什麽緣故。當時出席議會的政府大員，包含首相藏相，陸相，外相都不能給質問者以滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>這是一件日本人所不懂的事。</p>
<p>後來，由于戰事的進展，由于日本軍閥破壞法幣政策的加緊實施，我國法幣價值雖然跌落了一些，一百一十元左右才換得一百元日金，（現在也是差不多）。但是，這是和戰前的中日匯兌市價差不多，于是，一般日本人又覺到奇怪了：中國是敗得那麽「慘」了，「皇軍』楚勝傳那麽「難」了，照道理，中國的法幣，該是像第一次世界大戰結束時，戰敗國的德國的馬克一樣，不值分文的廢紙才對了，為甚麼中國的法幣價格，還是那麽高呢？這眞是一件神秘的事，是一件奇蹟！</p>
<p>不過，這件奇蹟，中國人是懂得它的柲奧的；歐熒人士也懂得它的秘奧的；甚至連日本軍閥也懂得，但是他無法解决其中的困難。只有日本人民，甚至連做到國會議員的高等人民，是不懂，不，是軍關不給他們懂得這件奇蹟秘奧。</p>
<p>在這裏，我就告訴讀者：這件事，就是中國必能最後把×××片甲不留地趕出領土去的反証。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的中國風</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>全面抗戰一年半後的中國，在國際上確乎贏得了好聲譽，即以滿副勢利眼光的好萊塢影都而論，對於中國也刮目相看。各戰片商紛紛把中國抗戰故事作為脚本，對於華籍演員所貢獻的意見，無不儘量採納，他們的地位眞是昨日今朝大不相同。</p>
<p>即如派拉蒙公司，最近攝製「唐城霸王」Kfng　ofChina　town一片，其中雖然沒有美國性的地痞階級，也沒有拖辮子繮小脚等東方舊習在內，但主角黃柳霜女士還覺得不滿意，她要求中國人身份與美國人一體看待，無分高下。便提出了三個條件：（一）取消該片中一「乾爺」這類語詞，（二）以接吻代替「撩鼻」。黃女士的意思；擦鼻表示觀熱，是北極愛斯基摩人的陋習，怎麽可拿來侮萬中國人呢？（三）製片商們一向以為中國人非醉生夢死便是葷頭葷腦的，這種觀念，應加以剷除。好啦，導演格林達見黃小姐理直氣壯，竟然一口答允照辦，並保証以後不再有同樣的事情出現。</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司近拍「視死如歸」一片（Life　lsCheap）由裴蒂富納，瓊克勒等主演，以中日戰事為題材，暴露侵略者的醜惡。但該公司當局為避免將來發生糾紛起見，片中角色都由美人祖任，並採用象徵的表演法，避免牽涉到一日本」人字樣，而由惡魔烏將軍担任反派，中國陳將軍担任正派。據說這樣做法已是非常大胆的了。</p>
<p>導演之王的西席地密爾君。鑒於各方面都在擁戴中國人，近也有感於中，决計把他新片中一個中國勞働者的鏡頭，拖着小辮子作着奴隸裝束的樣子，澈底廢除了，而改攝摩登中國工人的姿態，描寫他們正在艱苦壯穆中築造一條鐵路，充滿了活潑可親的姿態。</p>
<p>所以隨着時代的推進，好萊塢導演們的「中國認識」是全部改觀了，將進一步同情中國人，擁護中國人，而不像從前那樣扭曲事實的眞相了。</p>
<h3>免開尊口</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>臥室的對憲，是一家舞塲，每晚熄燈安睡以後，看着照耀到床前的霓虹燈光，每每想起東京銀座街禁用霓虹燈的消息來。我沒有到過日本，自然沒有領略過銀座街的風光，不過據朋友說：銀座街是東京最熱鬧的街道，尤其是晚膳以後，徜徉其間，是別有風味的。然而在這樣熱鬧的街道上，一旦禁用了增加都市容光的霓虹燈，其黯然失色，是可以想見的。</p>
<p>但是為了「百年戰爭」似乎不得不節約救難。霓虹燈旣禁用於先，火柴桿亦截短於後，以及上辦公廳廢除皮鞋，而穿着木屐等等，「膺懲」的反響，確實是有些手忙脚亂了。</p>
<p>前幾天見本港快訊社電：「據台灣消息，日人在台向民間取去之金銀器皿，在去年一年間，約九百餘萬日元，其所取之物品，無論酒瓶，茶壺，舊幣都有。甚至向人民口中取下其金鑲之假牙去。」</p>
<p>這眞是一則有趣的新聞。我們有句形容貧窮的俗語，叫做「除出鈕子無沒銅」，（從前衣服上都用銅鈕扣，如上海風行過一時的「套鈕」一樣，現在却更禍延金鑲的假牙，其貧窮的程度，也不言可喻了。</p>
<p>所以，令人憂慮的是：那些金鑲的假牙也都敲了下來以後，還將轉些什麼念頭出來？某報以「免開尊口」作為這條電訊的標題，我以為轉贈這些「大言不慚」的發言人，倒是為適當的。</p>
<p>什麽什麽，一切一切，還是「免開尊口」吧。</p>

<p>孔子河這小鎮論地勢還不壤，有山，有水田宜於耕作。人口不多。看起來不過四五十戶人家，家家都在過著安享的日子。河把小鎭分成兩半，河上架着一座寬大的石橋，雜貨舖子全開在橋西。在一家舖店的大牆上，不知是那一師的政治部貼一排比人還高的標語：</p>
<p>「寗作戰死鬼，不作亡國奴！」</p>
<p>我們回到放背包的地方休息着，兩條腿酸溜溜的雞受，任便你放在什麽地方，再也不舒服。於是掏出乾糧來，塡滿空癟的肚子。</p>
<p>圍上來一羣鄉下人，他們望着我們發笑。</p>
<p>「笑什麼，你們不怕大兵麽？」</p>
<p>「不，從前害怕，打日本以後的兵全很文明。」</p>

<p>等人們睡醒之後問問開飯的時間的時候，可就失望了。買不到東西作什麼吃！單說伙夫正打開麺袋預備作無榮麺條，但那還不知什麼時候才能燒好，有些人因為忍不住肚子的飢餓，就出屋外，到街上自雪飲食去。</p>
<p>街上兩樣了。</p>
<p>所有的舖子，全關了門，那樣子，就如過大年的情形，想買一點吃的東西，實在太難；街上來往的人，也比來時稀少，只有我們的幾個同志，提着紅白粉的罐于，用刷子在牆上寫着「軍民合作」一類的標語。</p>

<h3>The Temptation and ×× of the Oriental Aggressors - On Japan's Reply to the Tripartite Note from the United States, Britain, and France</h3>
<p>In light of the Japanese aggressors' ××× actions in the Far East, violating the Nine-Power Treaty, undermining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the security of the powers' interests in the Far East, the United States, Britain, and France successively presented strongly worded notes to the Japanese government in October and December of last year, and January of this year. All three notes explicitly stated: (1) Japan's actions in the Far East today clearly undermine the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the principle of the Open Door Policy; (2) they resolutely refuse to recognize any new situation in the Far East created by force; (3) they will continue to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, and all issues must be resolved fairly through international conferences. These solemn and forceful notes from the United States, Britain, and France were undoubtedly a rude awakening for the Japanese aggressors, especially at a time when the Japanese aggressors' offensive in China was entering a new stage of difficulty. It can indeed be seen as a major blow and a fresh example of Japan's isolation and lack of justice in the international community.</p>
<p>How did the Japanese aggressors respond to these forceful notes from the United States, Britain, and France? They had two paths to take. The first path was to accept the protests of the United States, Britain, and France, halt their military aggression in China, hold an international conference, and jointly discuss a thorough solution to the Far East problem. The second path was to resolutely reject the protests of the United States, Britain, and France, and continue to advance the so-called steps to create a new order in the Far East. However, the first path was clearly a fundamental negation of the fascist aggression route, forming a complete surrender of Japan to the European and American powers, which was not only unacceptable to the Japanese fascist military clique but also unbearable for the leaders of Japanese financial and capital tycoons to witness. As for the second path, it was advocated by the Japanese military clique and was also the intention of the leaders of financial and capital tycoons. However, this would not only further increase the difficulties of the Japanese aggressors in the international community, but they were also practically on the verge of being unable to support the military aggression in China. How could they create more powerful enemies and hasten their own demise? Because these two paths were impassable, they came up with a policy that combined enticement and intimidation.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 30th, Japan will notify the United States and Britain during the day, stating that Japan is willing to negotiate directly with them on the modification of the principles of the "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" in China. This is a kind of enticement. The purpose of this enticement policy is to cover up the damage inflicted on the European and American powers by Japan's aggression against China and expansion of its sphere of influence in the Far East, and to entice the European and American powers to be blinded by the nominal "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" principles, placing all the Far Eastern interests of various countries under the rule of the Japanese aggressors, serving the Japanese aggressors for life, intensifying the exploitation of China and even the weak and small nations in various parts of the Far East, and obtaining commissions or wages from Japan. Moreover, they specifically stated that they would negotiate directly with each country separately and were unwilling to participate in an international conference. This further reveals their cunning plan to defeat the peaceful and democratic countries one by one and undermine the joint sanctions of the peaceful and democratic countries.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the same day also stated that although Japan expressed its willingness to negotiate directly with the United States and Britain, before the negotiations, the United States and Britain must first recognize certain conditions, including (1) complete freedom of world commerce, (2) freedom of residence and travel for Eastern races, (3) abolition of tariff barriers and import restrictions, and free purchase of raw materials related to national survival. This is intimidation after enticement, that is, it is stated that Japan will never abandon its position and actions of promoting the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and establishing a "New Order in East Asia." In particular, the Reuters dispatch from Tokyo stated that the point that will be emphasized in Japan's reply is the so-called "complete freedom of world commerce," including (1) abolition of existing economic blocs and (2) abolition of tariff barriers. Also, the so-called "fair distribution of resources" includes (1) free purchase of raw materials for national survival and (2) free access to resources needed for national defense. These two points not only require the United States and Britain to openly recognize that Japan's plunder in China and military development in the Far East in the future are legitimate, but also to assume the obligation of supplying Japan with the raw materials and funds needed for aggression!</p>
<p>Judging from the content of this reply to the United States and Britain, which has been disclosed in advance by the Japanese side, it is evident that the Japanese aggressors have adopted a dual strategy of enticement and intimidation in response to the strong notes of the European and American powers. However, their lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Far East dispute can be said to be completely exposed. Especially at a time when the two Western aggressors, Italy and Germany, have just won a new victory in Spain, creating a sinister and volatile serious situation in Europe, especially at a time when the rulers of Britain and France, although severely damaged, are still unwilling to completely abandon their policy of appeasement towards the aggressors, and especially at a time when the anti-fascist and anti-aggression united front of righteous people and working masses from all over the world has not yet fully formed and expanded, it is not at all surprising that the Oriental aggressor, Japan ××, is taking the opportunity to entice and threaten the United States, Britain, and France, attempting to confiscate all their weapons of resistance and further act as an assistant to the Japanese aggressors.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to today is, first, although Japan's policy of enticement and intimidation can conversely prove the seriousness of the internal and external difficulties of the Japanese aggressors and that they will inevitably increase these difficulties as a result, we cannot ignore the fact that the Japanese fascist aggressors are closely colluding with the German and Italian fascist aggressors. This fact is the basis for Japan's continued ×× insidious and conspiratorial dual policy of enticement. We must expose this conspiracy of Japan ×× at any time and advise the friendly countries of peace and democracy. Secondly, if the friendly countries of peace and democracy, Britain and France, do not thoroughly abandon their policy of appeasement towards the fascist aggressors, then the insidious intimidation of the aggressive countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy will become even more unbridled, and any serious protests and forceful notes will become useless talismans. Therefore, we must urge the friendly countries of Britain, France, and the United States to use closely cooperative practical forces to counterattack the fascist aggressors and crush any enticement, intimidation, and conspiracy after such serious protests and forceful notes encounter failure. Finally, we must understand that this kind of counterattack can only be realized under the joint promotion of the righteous and peaceful people and the oppressed masses of all countries in the world. Therefore, we must mobilize all forces to organize this great force.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Aviation School</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Kunming</p>
<p>"Do not forget to seek out the bridge!" When you enter the simple and solemn auditorium of the aviation school, which is now located in ××, you will see many alarming slogans hanging inside. But the most striking thing among them is these four characters above.</p>
<p>The "bridge" is in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the birthplace of the Chinese Air Force, and also the original site of the current ×× Aviation School.</p>
<p>Calling on students not to forget to seek out the bridge is calling on students not to forget to "recover lost territory." This is a slogan in the auditorium of the ×× Aviation School that is most likely to stimulate people.</p>
<p>Although the ×× Aviation School has moved to the rear in ××, in addition to training air force talents, every one of them is determined to go to the front. We have seen the fierce and brave combat of the air force at the front, creating extraordinary records fearlessly. If we consider the alarming slogans in the auditorium of their birthplace alma mater, we know that this is not without a reason.</p>
<p>When I went to visit Director Xu Yulin of the Political Training Department of the Aviation School, his reception was very friendly. He is from Zhejiang, and in his Mandarin conversation, he often revealed his original accent. When we talked about the future of the national war of resistance, he expressed his confidence in the combat capabilities of the Chinese Air Force, and his attitude was very firm. Later, I asked him about the mission of the Political Training Department in the whole school. In addition to explaining to the students about their political understanding, ... He and I had just walked to the entrance of the auditorium, and he smiled and looked at a cement couplet outside the auditorium: "Swear to be loyal subjects of the country, must be the leader's death soldiers." Indeed, although he did not say anything at this time, the most important mission of the Political Training Department in the aviation school, and its spirit, can be explained by this cement couplet instead of what Director Xu wanted to say.</p>
<p>Later, I went to visit the principal's office. Two wooden plaques with white characters on a black background were hanging at the entrance, which were "Principal's Office" and "Director of Education's Office."</p>
<p>The current Director of Education of the ×× Aviation School, Mr. Zhou Zhirou, who is well-known to everyone, represents Chairman Chiang in carrying out the school's administration. Because Director Zhou represents everything of Principal Chiang when carrying out the school's administration, people often call him Principal Zhou.</p>
<p>After entering the principal's reception room, the clean and tidy interior arrangement, surrounded by clear and bright sunlight, reflects into the hearts of every visitor like the spirit of the teachers and students full of vigor throughout the school. Although I had not yet seen the appearance of this master of the whole school, a typical image had already emerged in my mind through imagination. When the Director of Education came out and shook hands with me, his tall stature and bright eyes showed that he was a person with a very strong personality and willpower, who had been tempered for a long time. The handshake also revealed sincerity and composure, arousing a kind of indescribable and difficult-to-describe goodwill. The first impression that this Director Zhou gave people exceeded the typical image that I had imagined when I first entered the reception room.</p>
<p>I knew that I could not publicize any school affairs related to military operations during this period of national war of resistance, so I did not ask about them. However, I wanted to visit and write about the students' living conditions throughout the school to report to the readers, because this is also a fact that readers across the country are eager to know.</p>
<p>Director Zhou agreed to my request and allowed me to observe and visit the student dining hall and dormitory. Before parting with Director Zhou, I took a sitting portrait with him as a souvenir.</p>
<p>The ×× Aviation School, formerly known as the Central Aviation School, is the main school of all aviation schools in the country. The students trained here are prepared to be air force officers. Therefore, the level of students in the ×× Aviation School requires a high school graduation qualification to apply for the exam, and the standard of the level is higher than elsewhere. Students there only need to be listed in the graduation ceremony to become air force officers. The admission examination for students is extremely strict in terms of intelligence, occupation, and physique, so the level of students is also very uniform. Many famous flying generals since the War of Resistance have been officers who taught here and have just graduated.</p>
<p>When I visited an air force instructor, I asked him what his opinion of the students was? He smiled and said to me, "All the teachers and students in our school are classmates who came before and after. Many of my students in the past have now become my friends, and many of my teachers in the past are now working and joking together, and everyone has become friends. Here, the so-called 'teacher-student relationship' is seen as a very light question. We are just classmates who came before and after. If we want to be more strict, everyone is a 'Chinese Air Force comrade.' We have 'stages before and after,' and there is absolutely no question of any 'upper and lower stages' in the so-called teacher-student problem here."</p>
<p>This is very true. We can see that many officers are quite different in age, but the feelings they express are very intimate and loving. This proves that the words of the air force instructor are neither fabricated nor exaggerated.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between many instructors and students, as long as you look at their mutual actions, you can prove it very well. When instructors meet students, their attitude and expression show a very caring look, while students treat instructors with a very respectful attitude, which can be represented by an idiom: "extremely respectful in etiquette."</p>
<p>The students' physique is extremely tall and strong. The school's physical examination of students when they join the army is of course very important, but the physical fitness training and exercise of students after entering the school is also of great importance. Therefore, students spend a lot of time on physical fitness and exercise in their daily lives. When we go to visit the activities of the students of the ×× Aviation School, we should pay attention to their sports field. The various ball games of the Aviation School are very famous in ××, so when they compete with various universities, the Aviation School always has the advantage. This is of course because the students who apply for the Aviation School are originally very strong because they paid attention to sports before entering the school, but after entering the school, they pay great attention to physical fitness training, so excellent results in various ball games have become a natural result. Finally, in addition to the strict selection procedures before entering the school and the hard work and exercise after entering the school, there is another essential relationship with the strong physique of the students of the Aviation School, and that is the issue of health and nutrition in the school.</p>
<p>Regarding the nutrition problem of students at the ×× Aviation School, there is a very interesting and thought-provoking thing that happened recently, and I would like to attach it here.</p>
<p>When the ×× Aviation School was in Kuanqiao before, the school authorities paid great attention to the students' nutritional food, and provided porridge and milk every morning. Now that it has arrived in ××, because the milk production in the whole city is very small, it is not enough for the distribution of all students, so students only have porridge every morning and the milk has been reduced. Everyone can eat as much as they want in terms of porridge, but they lack milk. When I was visiting a student at an aviation school, because I talked about the diet problem in life, I mentioned the lack of milk. I asked him what his feelings were at the time? He replied very excitedly: "In this national war of resistance, many compatriots in the lost land do not even have porridge to eat. What is so important about us reducing a portion of milk every morning? Even in normal times, how can our clothes and food not come from the hands of compatriots across the country? Our service to the country and even sacrifice is our military duty. We often feel great unease when we see the suffering of the compatriots in the lost land, and we can't wait to fly forward and fight ×× desperately. Now, although we lack a portion of milk every morning, every time we have a meal, we will think of the suffering compatriots in the lost land, at the front, and in the rear when we see every grain of snow-white rice. We want to work hard to learn the combat and driving skills that the air force has, and to avenge and vent our anger for our compatriots across the country. As for some increases or decreases in food, we feel that it is not a very important issue. We know very well that the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters across the country are looking forward to us very much, and we will never live up to their high expectations. Please tell them frankly in the war of resistance that we will definitely avenge and clear their shame for them. Our bodies were originally the country's. It is publicly owned by compatriots across the country, please rest assured"!</p>
<p>When this student of the Aviation School talked about "Please rest assured," tears were already leaking out of his slightly red eyes. I shook the hand of farewell tightly under great emotion.</p>
<p>Before I was about to withdraw from the ×× Aviation School, I suddenly saw two slogans, and now I will write them out as the conclusion of this visit:</p>
<p>"Our bodies, planes, and bombs should perish together with the enemy's naval positions!" (Li Baoquan)</p>
<h3>Four Major Events in Hengyang</h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>Hitting the "Stray Dog" Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>The first shot of the 28th year was the Kuomintang's opening Xu traitor to betray the party and the country, and Wang Jingwei, who sued × for peace. This was a loud noise that excited all Chinese people, even international people, and gave a '?' in the brain pattern of many people. The Hengyang salvation workers quickly wanted to use this as an expanded political publicity, so they ran around shouting, promoting the early realization of this movement. As a result, the anti-Wang climax in various places impacted the party and government authorities in Hengyang, and decided to convene an anti-Wang conference (later, because they felt that Wang did not need to be 'discussed,' they changed it to 'dismissing' Wang). Before the meeting, the wartime service group Hengyang service office of the Military Commission and the anti-× drama troupe No. 8 of the Political Department of the Military Commission and the wartime service group of the Hankou Women's Christian Association launched an anti-Wang symposium. At this meeting, representatives of government agencies, and various cultural, work, service groups and individuals attended and launched a heated discussion, especially the speech of the representative of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway workers, which won the applause of everyone.</p>
<p>"...Our anti-Wang is to attack Wang's traitorous remarks, and to eliminate Wang's echo bugs in every corner. The War of Resistance is like a locomotive. The locomotive accepts new fuel on one side, and eliminates the residue on the other. Wang is the coal that has been excavated, which is not only not worth regretting, but also very beneficial..." He used his life to make an appropriate proportion, which was very popular among the audience.</p>
<p>After discussing for a full five hours, a common conclusion was reached:</p>
<p>(1) Wang is a thorough speculator. In his revolutionary history and life history, he is full of the stains of shaking, being despicable, and betraying the revolution. Even his most readable assassination of Prince Regent is also opportunistic. (Originally, the assassination of Prince Regent was a decision of the Tongmenghui. The method of assassination was to bury bombs, and several people including Wang took turns guarding the fuse. When Prince Regent passed by, they would light the fire to blow it up. As a result, when it was Wang's turn to guard, Prince Regent was passing by, and Wang was extremely panicked, and the matter was not completed. He was caught by the Qing soldiers. Later, Han told the entire plan and conspiratorial comrades, and used this to curry favor with the Qing court, and was escorted by the Qing court to study in Japan, while other comrades all died. This is the biggest stain in the history of the revolution.)</p>
<p>(2) Wang is a typical person who values ​​personal interests more than national interests. In order to achieve his own selfish desires, he does not hesitate to take the most despicable means.</p>
<p>(3) During the War of Resistance, Wang also echoed with the voice, but the anti-war force overwhelmed the "peace" force, but he still looked for opportunities to destroy the War of Resistance anytime and anywhere. For example, his past talks were very skillfully propagandizing reaction.</p>
<p>(4) Wang's rebellion is a matter of time and a predetermined plan.</p>
<p>(5) Therefore, we must carry out universal and in-depth publicity to prevent Wang from becoming the second Franco in Spain.</p>
<p>(6) The government's and leader's decisive handling this time is the most supported by the people, and it shows the government's wisdom and determination to fight to the end.</p>
<p>(7) Send a telegram, publish a special edition, picture magazine, write anti-Wang scripts, songs, and immediately organize a propaganda department to go to the countryside.</p>
<p>The chairman of this symposium was Mr. Liu Chenlie, one of the chairmen of the Hengyang All Walks of Life Anti-Wang Conference. We asked him to report this record to the general assembly and launch a wider discussion.</p>
<p>The Tide of Charity Sales is Spreading</p>
<p>Since the fire of charity sales was lit in Hong Kong, every corner of China has had sparks of charity sales; Hunan's first charity association was the Dagang Daily in Hengyang, followed by the No. 8 Anti-× Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Commission, in addition to taking out a part of the troupe's living expenses to pre-purchase the first newspaper of Dagang, it also decided to perform one day, and donate all the income to the War of Resistance; then the resident Chong troupes also responded and organized a Response to Charity Movement Performance Committee, stipulating a continuous performance for seven days. The members of this committee, in addition to the eighth troupe, include the first itinerant drama education troupe of the Ministry of Education, the 49th troupe, the 77th troupe, Xiang opera, and new opera - the scripts performed include the five-act play "Roar of the Ancient City" of the first drama education troupe, the "Northeast Corner" and "Cold Clothes Song" of the 49th troupe, the "Dynamite" of the 77th troupe, and others, and the four-act play "Phoenix City" of the Anti-Drama Troupe No. 8 - this script depicts the situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army Miao Kexiu, Deng Tiemei, Zhao Tong (the son of Zhao Laotai, the mother of the guerrillas)... fighting heroically in the difficult rear of the × people. It is the latest masterpiece and has only been performed once in Chongqing in China. This time is the second performance - the performance date is from the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>Various troupes are working hard to prepare. The charity sale day of Dagang Daily (15th) has arrived, so everyone enthusiastically participated in the charity newspaper sales team. In total, Dagang Daily earned more than 4,200 yuan, ranking third among the charity sale income of newspapers across the country, and also sold a 500 yuan newspaper, breaking the national record.</p>
<p>In addition to the drama industry, several taverns are also holding eight days of 20% charity sales. In short, the charity sale is like a big stone thrown into the calm water, expanding its wave circle.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee issued a declaration today. The original text reads: Since the Provisional National Congress in April of last year, our Party, based on the resolutions of the Congress and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction, has encouraged and steeled the compatriots of the whole country to continue their efforts in the sacred war of resistance, while simultaneously carrying out the work of national reconstruction amidst the war of resistance. Over the past eighteen months, the military and the people have been of one mind and one heart, their will growing stronger. Although the war zones have shifted, the foundation of the nation has become more solid. Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the situation of the war of resistance has shifted from the initial stage to the later stage. The main purpose of the initial stage of the war of resistance was to deplete the enemy's strength, expose the enemy's conspiracies, and complete the strategy and deployment for the later stage of the war of resistance. The task of the later stage of the war of resistance is to build upon the achievements of the struggle in the initial stage, to bring into play all the forces of resistance in the front and rear areas and in the occupied areas, in order to achieve final victory and the success of national reconstruction. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is appropriately held today, at the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance. Recalling the war achievements of the past eighteen months, and the glorious sacrifices and contributions of our soldiers and people throughout the country, we deeply feel that the struggle from now on is a key to determining the survival and prosperity of our nation. Therefore, after careful consideration of internal and external facts, we have established a strategy for the later stage of the war of resistance and are striving to implement it. We hereby declare its main points to all comrades of our Party and all compatriots of the country with all sincerity.</p>
<p>The Invasion Has Lasted Only a Year and a Half, But the Enemy Is Already in Dire Straits</p>
<p>In the past eighteen months of the war of resistance, the deeper the enemy’s invasion, the more depleted their military strength, and the more severe their financial, economic, and social crises. From the Battle of Southern Shandong to the battles along the Yangtze River, the enemy troops have suffered more than 500,000 casualties, and the war expenses have increased to more than 9 billion. Political tides have risen and fallen within the enemy's country, and infighting has deepened. In recent months, they have even issued their so-called "New Order in East Asia" declaration, hoping to use this absurd theory to cover up their atrocities. However, all countries in the world have already seen through their concealment.</p>
<p>The purpose of our sacred war of resistance is to seek national independence and the survival of our people. Although we have lost vast territory and suffered many casualties, the soldiers and people of the whole country share a common hatred of the enemy, and their morale is rising. Everyone is determined to die in order to build an eternal cause for the country. Our country has always been a peace-loving nation. The reason why we are enduring a long and arduous war, without shying away from any sacrifice, is actually the result of the Japanese militarists' continuous use of military force to invade and their implementation of a policy of gradual encroachment and annexation, reaching a final critical juncture. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has brazenly disregarded everything, broken the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and implemented the occupation of our Northeast four provinces. On July 7th of the year before last, they went even further, launching an attack on the Lugou Bridge and occupying Beijing and Tianjin. The lifeline and the destiny of the people of our country have reached a point of survival or extinction. The entire nation, from top to bottom, can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, even though we know that our military equipment is inferior to the enemy's, we have no choice but to engage in a difficult and tragic war of resistance in order to maintain the survival of our nation and people. "We will never abandon peace as long as there is a glimmer of hope; we will resolutely sacrifice when the sacrifice has reached the final critical juncture." This is the determination repeatedly stated by the President of our Party, and it is also the national policy unanimously adhered to by our people.</p>
<p>The Japanese militarists' ambition to annex the mainland is, externally, the public enemy of the world, and internally, hated by the people. Looking at the years since the September 18th Incident, within a few years, three of their prime ministers have been assassinated, two finance ministers have been assassinated, four naval and army generals have been assassinated, more than a hundred university professors have been arrested and imprisoned, and countless people have been executed for opposing the war. The unity they maintain today is merely a manifestation of the militarists' oppressive power. As the ancient saying goes, "When two armies meet, the one with grief will prevail." The grief and indignation of our people throughout the country in resisting aggression and the righteousness of defending peace are sufficient to serve as the main force in defeating the enemy. As the later stage of the war of resistance begins, it is even more important for our compatriots throughout the country to jointly and consistently adhere to the main points of the old struggle.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Goal of the War of Resistance Is to Seek the Happiness of Mankind</p>
<p>The Declaration of the Provisional National Congress stated: "What we seek is a peace that conforms to justice, not a peace of surrender: surrender only serves to encourage aggression." The Provisional National Congress further explicitly pointed out that in order to establish the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, and to realize a country of equality and freedom, we will not stop until we achieve our goal. The Three Principles of the People, created by the Premier to lead the national revival of China and establish the Republic of China, are to strive for national independence, for the survival of the nation, for the permanent peace of East Asia, and for the dignified justice of the world. The meaning of today's war of resistance is also the same. Japanese civilization initially sought it from Korea, and then from our country. Everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, morality, and ethics, there is nothing that we do not share. Our country has been known for its wealth and strength in East Asia for thousands of years. Japan's strength is only a few decades old, and Korea has already been destroyed by them. Now, they are even trying to annex our China. Looking at the militarists' mad words, they directly want to control the entire globe and subdue Europe and the United States. Their withdrawal from the League of Nations and tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty are merely the beginning of their unleashing of violence upon the world. The reason why our country is resolutely resisting today is not only to resist the enemy invading our country and to restore the integrity of our sovereignty, territory, and administration, but also to punish the instigators who destroy the dignity of treaties and endanger world peace. We sincerely hope that friendly nations around the world who uphold peace will bring into play the spirit of concerted unity, protect the treaties that share common interests, implement effective methods, and eliminate the spread of war. Only in this way can we seek the peace of the world and promote the happiness of mankind. This is the common understanding and unwavering determination of our 450 million people.</p>
<p>All Countries Unite to Help Us Eliminate the Tragedy of War</p>
<p>Looking at the evolution of the international situation over the past year, it is quite similar to the eve of the European War in the past. The crisis is deeper and broader, far from what the European War could compare to. Taking the situation since the start of the Japanese invasion of China as an example, they use air force to bomb our undefended cities, villages, and cultural buildings. The scenes of their brutality and ferocity are not found in the European War. All countries, governments, and peoples in the world who love peace and respect justice have the same urgent feeling. In the past few years, those who tried to call for the efficacy of international law and to prevent the spread of war with lip service and written words have now changed their direction and are simultaneously seeking to use force as a guarantee for self-defense and common defense. As of today, it is clear that Japan's invasion of China is a threat to the foundation of the Pacific Ocean; and the Pacific Ocean is the world's largest market. Last autumn, the Japanese army invaded Wuhan, attacked Guangzhou, and blockaded the two major rivers, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The League of Nations happened to be meeting at this time. Friendly nations such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, acting righteously and exerting their efforts, unanimously supported China and passed the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, applicable to Japan's aggression. Recently, the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution of January 19th further invited countries related to the Far East situation to consult with each other in order to take effective measures to provide assistance to our country. At the same time, US President Roosevelt strongly upheld the Nine-Power Treaty and issued a firm warning to Japan, and Britain and France followed suit to jointly maintain the treaty. The purpose of this is not only to stop Japan's aggression, but also to eliminate all the tragedies that destroy world peace. Our country, at a time of difficulty and danger, is deeply grateful for this noble friendship that supports the endangered and upholds the precarious. We are also confident that our Chinese nation, by exerting its sincerity in upholding public reason and justice, will contribute to the future of human civilization and world peace, and will surely live up to the high expectations of our friendly nations. We are even more convinced that our Republic of China has the determination to eliminate world wars and promote the peaceful life of mankind in the world. (Unclear telecode)</p>
<p>We Will Continue to Sincerely Uphold the Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>At a time when the countries of the Great War were suffering from the lack of effective aftermath, our Premier published his great plan for developing Chinese industries. He believed that (unclear telecode) Japan's intensified aggression against China would inevitably lead the world to a point where it could not extricate itself. He repeatedly explained, although he spoke of (unclear telecode) now the US President specifically invokes the Nine-Power Treaty to call on the world to maintain the treaty in order to restore peace in East Asia. And (unclear telecode) the two major principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are: one is to respect the sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity of China, and the other is to open the door and equal opportunity (unclear telecode), developing Chinese industries, even more, to firmly believe that our people not only support the principle of opening the door, but also are willing to cooperate with the world's countries in a mutually beneficial and peaceful cooperation on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>We Sincerely Hope That the Soldiers and Civilians of the Whole Country Will Strive for the Final Victory Together</p>
<p>The most urgent words in the conclusion of the Premier's plan for developing Chinese industries are: "Japan always gets the best reward from every war, no wonder the Japanese militarists regard war as the most profitable business." Now that China has awakened, Japan wants to implement a policy of aggression, and the Chinese people will also come out to reject it. Even if China is unfortunate for Japan (the following telecode is unclear for about a hundred words) The belief that national reconstruction will be successful is already so firm that it cannot be changed. Today, when this sacred sacrifice has displayed unparalleled brilliance, we especially hope that the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will further invigorate the spirit of their old gates and advance bravely in order to win the victory of the war of resistance, to establish the foundation for the construction of the Republic of China, and to cooperate sincerely with the friendly nations of the world on the principle of mutual assistance and peace, and to complete the great cause of building the Republic of China. Only in this way can we not fail the heroic sacrifices of millions of our compatriots, and allow our people throughout the country and their descendants, as well as the infinite human beings of the world, to jointly enjoy the peace and happiness created and guaranteed by our soldiers and civilians with their lives. The Japanese militarists, their perverse thoughts, cunning attempts, and cruel actions, which they are applying to our country today, will also lead to an even more tragic result for themselves. The rebellious incidents that have occurred continuously in their country since September 18th (unclear telecode) the evil consequences created, I am afraid, are even more than (unclear telecode) killing our compatriots with weapons and violence.</p>
<p>Understanding the above, we can know that resolutely resisting the war is the consistent mission of the national revolution, and it is also our only sincerity in saving the country and saving the world. Violent × (unclear telecode) our soldiers and civilians throughout the country, from the beginning of the war to (unclear telecode), strengthen unity, actively fight the old battles and work hard on construction. And improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline are the guarantee for the success of the above three things. The main points are listed on the left:</p>
<p>First, Strengthen Unity and Implement the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>(1) The so-called strengthening of unity. The conference believes that unity must be based on sincerity, and the revolutionary spirit must be pure. The Provisional National Congress solemnly declared, hoping that the people of the country who are ambitious will concentrate in our Party and fight the old battles together. This session of the conference sincerely hopes again. The country is in such great danger that it must increase its strength in resisting the war and building the country as much as possible in order to achieve the effect of uniting the people and turning them into a city. Compatriots throughout the country, regardless of their past political views and factions, are sincerely welcome to join our Party and engage in the sacred cause of national revolution, resistance to the war, and national reconstruction, as long as they are willing to implement the Three Principles of the People. However, the purpose of the national revolution is to seek national independence and the survival of the nation, so it is necessary to maintain the sincere and pure spirit of the Chinese nation, and then the foundation of the country can be consolidated. This conference solemnly declares that we absolutely do not want to see the fact of dual party membership in the Party leading the revolution; and we cannot bear to see the consistent goal of implementing the Three Principles of the People in China and completing the revolutionary reconstruction of the country be frustrated due to a lack of faith and a lack of will. When the countries of the world began their revolutions and national reconstruction, they all succeeded in brushing away difficulties and reaching success because the entire country was united and the people were of one mind. There is absolutely no second way to do it, whether in China or abroad, ancient or modern. From now on, our compatriots must sincerely unite, exhaust their wisdom and be loyal, believe in and practice the Three Principles of the People, do their best for the later stage of the war of resistance, and establish an unshakable foundation for the great cause of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Second, Actively Fight and Strive to Resist the War to the End</p>
<p>(2) The so-called active struggle. Our compatriots should know that "those who travel a hundred miles are halfway at ninety, and the last journey is often the most difficult." When we review all the work in the past, we have not yet done our best. What we have worked hard on is not completely certain, not completely coordinated, and we have not been able to be consistent in word and deed and make consistent contributions to meet the needs of the war. Today's later stage of the war of resistance is actually the final victory or defeat between our country and the Japanese militarists. The thoughts and actions of all soldiers and civilians in the front and rear, especially in the occupied areas, or in the military areas near the war zones, if they cannot be strictly reflected on, strictly reported on, and strictly corrected, and if they cannot completely contribute their abilities, freedom, and lives to the country and increase the strength of the counterattack, then the achievements of the countless martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the old battles will fail, and our nation will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, from now on, our comrades and compatriots must swear allegiance together, under the leadership of the supreme commander, with no reservations and no hesitation, and march forward bravely to win the success of national independence and national survival in this war of life and death.</p>
<p>Third, Accelerate Construction and Improve People's Lives</p>
<p>(3) Regarding accelerating construction. We must know that the main force in building a country lies in building an army. Without a national army as strong as gold and stone, the people's livelihood cannot be guaranteed, the people's rights cannot be maintained, and the nation cannot survive. And psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction are the foundations for building an army. The so-called psychological construction must be based on the Premier's theory that knowledge is easy and action is difficult, carry forward the Premier's spirit of military education, popularize national military training, increase educational efficiency, and promote wartime service, so that all compatriots in the country are revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People, and seek the final victory with the spirit of success or benevolence. The so-called political construction requires strict rewards and punishments, comprehensively explains the truth, concentrates strength, increases efficiency, strengthens the organization of the people, unifies the actions of the people, alleviates the suffering of the people, and improves the lives of the people. At the critical juncture of the beginning of the later stage of the war of resistance, when life and death depend on it, it is especially necessary to form a unified command structure of the central party, government, and military so that the work of the party and government throughout the country can be closely integrated with the military affairs in order to achieve the effect of joint action. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council is specially established to unify the command of the party, government, and military. Economic construction is not only related to the victory or defeat of the war of resistance, but also to the success or failure of national reconstruction. It must be based on the needs of the people's lives during the war, distinguish between priorities, consider the slow thoughts and implement the controlled economy, and adjust the production and consumption of materials. All heavy industries and mining industries necessary for the war of resistance, light industries necessary for the daily life of the people, and urgent railways, air lines, and highways, etc., should strive to do what they can and work hard to promote them. More solid currency system, smooth financial gold, promote the development of public and private industries, and other improvements in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, all depend on the development of the hidden treasures. In increasing the production capacity of the provinces, it is especially necessary to match the power of all capital technologies of the government and the people, and earnestly accelerate the implementation. This kind of economic construction is not only to enrich the strength of the war of resistance, but also to lay the foundation for implementing the welfare of the people. As for the governments and peoples of friendly nations around the world, either assisting with material and financial resources, or supporting with spiritual and moral support, or providing relief to soldiers and civilians injured, sick, hungry, and cold, or helping us to restore schools destroyed by the enemy. All these noble acts will be eternally remembered. We firmly believe that the result of our country's war of resistance will be to restore our national sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, and will be able to revive the authority of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. How can the principle of open door and equal opportunity be implemented alone, the great plan that our Premier suggested to the world twenty years ago, to combine international peace and mutual assistance, and to jointly develop Chinese industries, can also be realized. With the wealth of our raw materials, the breadth of our market, and the urgent need for reconstruction after the war, for the absorption of foreign capital and technical cooperation, and for the existing capabilities of the industrial countries, we will never worry about its excess. And if our people throughout the country put in more effort today, they will surely gain ten or a hundred times the benefits after the war. Because all true economic benefits are absolutely private to the world and mankind.</p>
<p>Implement Revolutionary Discipline and Improve National Spirit</p>
<p>The above three things are the goals that our country should actively strive for, and the fundamental meaning lies in improving the national spirit and rectifying revolutionary discipline in order to realize the Three Principles of the People of revolutionary reconstruction. In the past, the Premier spoke about the electric spirit education, and explained with deep feeling: "Humans have the use of spirit, not just the physical body." "If you want to take on an extraordinary career, you must rely on the extraordinary, spirit." Especially lifting up wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the morals that those who are revolutionary and save the country must have: only wisdom that conforms to morality is the wisdom needed for revolution; only the ability to avoid things when they happen, to go forward without fear, and to have a spirit of resolute death that does not take or fear, is the courage needed for revolution; only "sacrificing life to save the world, picking up life to save the country, not asking for benefits, and fulfilling responsibility" is the benevolence on which the revolutionary cause depends to achieve. Without seeking life to harm benevolence, there is killing oneself to achieve benevolence, beginning with great wisdom, ending with great courage, and only then can we build the country, complete the revolution, and protect the life of our nation forever. At this critical moment of life and death, our compatriots throughout the country only have the determination to achieve benevolence and take righteousness, to implement the great road of the Three Principles of the People, to swear to die, to be old and brave and loyal, and to establish the foundation of the country for billions of years with the lives of our decades of inevitable death, then there is no fear that the war of resistance will not be victorious, and there is no fear that the country will not be built. Among the comrades in our Party, and all those who hold national military and political positions, everyone should be mindful of the seriousness of their duties and revolutionary discipline, set an example, and be the vanguard of the people. It is necessary to establish strict discipline, establish the justice of believing in rewards and punishments, and then we can gather the public's will into one mind, combine the public's strength into one body, and not endanger the country because of the loss of one corner, and not harm the public because of the mistake of one person. It must be known that the war of resistance against the enemy is a struggle for life and death in an instant, and the great cause of national reconstruction is a permanent and indestructible work; if it is not disciplined with strict and clear discipline, how can it achieve the practical effect of success? Therefore, the strict execution of revolutionary discipline is the thorough invigoration of the spirit of the war of resistance, which is the greatest guarantee for the victory and success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and must be implemented with all efforts.</p>
<p>Only One Basket Remains to Be Completed, and Victory Will Ultimately Belong to Us</p>
<p>Our Party is based on the historical mission of revolutionary reconstruction. At the time of national and national crisis, we lead the people to resolutely shoulder the responsibility. The heavier the responsibility, the more difficult the mission. All our comrades must sincerely abide by the resolutions, be of one mind and one heart, accept the President's instructions to improve party virtues and consolidate the party's foundations, invigorate their spirits, concentrate their wills, strengthen their faith, enrich their abilities, and go deep into the masses, the war zones, the devastated areas, and the lower-level villages. They must endure hardships and persevere, set an example, be the first to face difficulties, and fear being late for righteousness. With this spirit, they will do their best to fulfill their duties, and with this spirit, they will impress both China and foreign countries. As for our compatriots throughout the country, there may be a first or second to hear about righteousness, but there should be no difference in rushing to righteousness. The reason why this war of resistance can be sustained and unyielding is that it is the great continuation of the tireless struggle and the sacrifice of everything by our people throughout the country to engage in the great cause of saving the country and building the country. Now that the war of resistance has entered the later stage, only one basket remains to be completed. Those who gain the Dao will receive more help. The sympathy of the world has been gathered in our country. The great task of completing the revival will definitely belong to us. We see the date of victory in the war of resistance, at the meeting of the completion of the reconstruction of the country. We hope that all comrades in our Party and all compatriots in the country will work together with this intention and do their best to fulfill it!</p>
<h3>I Am Working Hard to Build a New Air Force</h3>
<p>[Shanghai, 30th, Foreign Telegram] Our country's third phase of the new air force is now using personnel from the United States and the Soviet Union to vigorously develop and compete with Japan for air superiority. After nineteen months of resistance, the influence of Italy in the Chinese Air Force has been completely eliminated. After the fall of Nanjing, most of China's air battles relied on Soviet pilots and aircraft. At the same time, China's aviation schools have also moved to Kunming. In recent weeks, new trainers from the United States have arrived. Chinese young pilots are receiving extremely strict training and will surely pose a significant threat to Japan in the future.</p>
<h3>National Army to be Reorganized and Trained in Stages; First Group of Troops Arrive at Designated Locations; War Resistance Strength Will Increase After Four Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 30th Dispatch] In order to strengthen our war resistance capabilities, the national army will be reorganized and trained in stages. Currently, the first group of troops to be reorganized have been moved separately and have reached their designated locations. They are divided into five zones: the first zone is the army of Tao Zhiyue, which will be supervised and trained by a certain army corps commander nearby; the second zone is the armies of Xiao Zhichu, Sun Zhen, Chen Dingdong, and Song Xilian, which are divided into two locations and supervised and trained by a certain commander-in-chief nearby; the third zone is the armies of Yao Chun and Guo Chan, and the division of Fu Zhongfang, which are also divided into two locations and supervised and trained by a certain committee member nearby; the fourth zone is the army of Chen Anle, which will be supervised and trained by a certain commander-in-chief nearby; the fifth zone is the armies of Li Yannian, Gan Lichu, Zhang Yunsong, a certain division of Wang Zhonglian's army, the Xu Tingyao division of the New XX Army, and the Lin Ying division of the Honorary X Division, which are divided into two locations and directly supervised and trained by the Ministry of Military Training. The first phase will be completed in X months, after which the army commander will review the troops. The second phase will be completed in X months, and will be reviewed by the supervisors from the Ministry of Military Training. As for the officers, they will be trained by subject to improve their skills. Without hindering the scope of troop education, short-term training classes for various arms will be convened in stages to reorganize and train officers.</p>
<h3>X Plots to Sabotage Our Country's Finances; Counterfeits Tens of Millions of Our Legal Tender; Mixes Them into the Inland to Absorb Private Savings; Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed to Banking Industry to Pay Attention to Investigation and Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since our country's war of resistance began nineteen months ago, we have adhered to an unyielding spirit and strived to fight. Therefore, the X people have gradually become embarrassed. Whether in terms of popular morale, military resources, or the economy, they clearly have major weaknesses. Especially due to the lack of funds, the prolonged war is the greatest crisis. On the other hand, our country, due to its firm will to resist the war, has gained international sympathy and faith. The second credit loans from Britain and the United States are about to be successful, and our country's war resistance resources will become more solid. The X people, in order to weaken our war resistance strength, are also trying to sabotage our country's economy and finances. For example, they are wantonly issuing banknotes in the occupied areas and war zones to absorb our country's legal tender, which is their most vicious means. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, even counterfeiting our country's legal tender plates and privately printing large amounts of counterfeit money, distributing it to the interior and various places in an attempt to undermine our country's economic credibility and absorb private savings. Their intentions are extremely cunning. Recently, after the Ministry of Finance received a report, it was sincerely afraid that merchants in various places would be unaware and mistakenly use it, which would have a significant impact. Therefore, it has specially issued a notice to merchants in various places to be aware of this counterfeit money and strictly investigate and prohibit it. The banking industry also received a notice yesterday, which stated: "(Above omitted) According to reliable reports, the Japanese are privately printing tens of millions of our country's legal tender in XX, using Japanese spies, Japanese residents, and traitors to use them in various places, which has a huge impact on finance. It is urgent to issue a unified notice to pay attention to investigation and prohibition in order to prevent this. In addition to having secretly transferred this to the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks to inform their branches to pay attention, and secretly ordering each bank to find examples of counterfeit currency, distinguish the differences between genuine and counterfeit currency, and report them by telegram, we are also corresponding to request that you investigate and instruct your subordinates to pay attention to investigation and prohibition."

<p>X Plots to Monopolize Resources in Southern China</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] The news that Japanese sugar, mining, electric power, and shipping experts are going to Southern China for inspection has attracted close attention from economic and business circles here. The inspection team, led by Viscount Inoue, Director-General of the South Asia Development Agency of Japan, departed from Taiwan and is expected to arrive in Guangzhou on the 25th. The Japan Times stated, "The team will conduct a detailed investigation in Southern China and report to the government so that the Japanese government can formulate a basic plan for developing the economy of Southern China." It is also learned that the Japanese military stationed in Southern China and some people involved in the sugar industry have strongly advocated obtaining "Manchurian" sugar industry cooperation between China and Japan in order to create a self-sufficient situation. Therefore, the Secretary-General of the Japan Federation and thirteen technicians have been ordered to participate in this inspection in order to achieve the goal of monopolizing the sugar market in China.</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Relations Improve; Italy Also Following Germany's Lead; Anti-Comintern Pact Will Become Waste Paper</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] According to German private sources, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have greatly improved recently. Therefore, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan will become a piece of waste paper, and Japan will soon be abandoned by Germany and Italy. This trend is naturally important to the international situation. Berlin has sent a commercial investigation team to Moscow soon to discuss German-Soviet trade matters and improve the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The fascism of Germany and the socialism of the Soviet Union are not as incompatible as fire and water, because Hitlerism is also based on socialism. Furthermore, even if the two countries have different political ideals, the differences are very small. The conflicts between the two countries in recent years have been caused by national policies. The Soviet Union now wants to act freely in the Far East in order to deal with Japan, and Germany is also eager to act freely in Europe. Because of the existence of these basic conditions, the two countries have the possibility of approaching each other. Moreover, Hitler's faction feels that Germany's assistance to Japan against China has hundreds of disadvantages and no benefits. Germany's attitude is such that Italy is also following Germany's lead to improve its relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th] During the budget debate held in the parliament here, Foreign Minister Arita stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact is aimed at resisting the "evil forces of communism." Japan's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is due to "the excessive activity of communism in China" and has no other intentions. Although Japan's attempt to coerce Chiang Kai-shek to join the Anti-Comintern Pact has been abandoned, Arita still refused to announce the new policy to be adopted in the future. Arita also stated that it is difficult to estimate the special expenditure for the war in China, but pointed out that the special budget caused by Japan before and after the war lasted for ten years. The debate ended at noon.</p>
<p>Japan's Diplomatic Predicament; Envoys to Europe Hold Conference in France; Attempt Military Alliance with Germany and Italy</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] Japanese ambassadors to various European countries recently held a meeting in Paris. The purpose was not announced, but according to the ambassadors, this kind of meeting is held regularly in the capitals of European countries so that the participants can exchange information on the political situation. Recently, Ambassador Shirotori, who was stationed in Italy, arrived at his post from his home country, so a meeting was held to allow Shirotori to understand the European situation and listen to his report on Japan's recent situation. According to reports, the first meeting was held last Friday, but Shirotori was unable to attend due to illness. The second meeting was held on Saturday night. The results were not officially announced, but according to "Paris Evening News," "According to absolutely reliable sources, the theme of the meeting was the possibility of Japan, Italy, and Germany concluding a military alliance to make the Anti-Comintern Pact more complete. This proposal was advocated by Ambassador Oshima to Germany. Not long ago, Oshima met with Shirotori. The two felt that the military cooperation of the Anti-Comintern countries should be far closer than it is now, so they decided to invite their European colleagues to gather in Paris. The so-called military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is not new. Military personnel have long advocated this, but now their power to manipulate foreign policy is even stronger, so they are making persistent efforts to achieve it. Oshima is one of the advocates of this view, and Shirotori also shares his views." "Paris Evening News" also stated that Shigemitsu Aoi, Tanegane, and Kurusu are conservative diplomats who advocate adopting a cautious policy to avoid concluding a sensational military alliance. Therefore, the ambassadors now all support Oshima's policy, and they have also worked hard to overcome the arguments of the conservatives. According to Oshima's observation, if Japan cooperates with European dictatorial countries, there is hope for an early end to the Sino-Japanese War. If the conflict between democratic countries and dictatorial countries becomes acute, Germany and Italy will also welcome cooperation with Japan, because at that time Japan can force Britain and France to station a part of their troops in the Far East. At the same time, if the dictatorial countries take strong action in Europe, they can also force the democratic countries to have no time to take care of the situation in China. According to the Japanese military, China cannot sustain the war of resistance for a long time without the assistance of democratic countries. If the democratic countries have difficulty taking care of China, Japan's war against China can be won sooner.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The talks between Japanese envoys to various European countries ended tonight. It is reported that the issues discussed were related to promoting the Anti-Comintern Pact. The participants included Ambassador Shigemitsu to the UK, Ambassador Shirotori to Italy, Ambassador Kurusu to Belgium, the minister to Spain (rebel government) and Switzerland, and the representative of Ambassador Oshima to Germany. Oshima was unable to attend due to illness. According to generally reliable sources in France, the talks were different from the usual meetings of Japanese envoys and were initiated by the ambassadors to Germany and Italy when they recently met in Italy to avoid the cold. There were differences of opinion among the ambassadors on the matter of promoting the Anti-Comintern Pact. Oshima's representative and Shirotori both advocated strengthening the ties between Germany and Italy, but the majority advocated "nurturing" the anti-communist ideas of European countries such as Britain. According to observations here, the final attitude of this matter will depend on the changes in the European situation.</p>
<h3>Britain Strives to Expand Air Force; Aircraft Production Will Equal Germany; France Pays Close Attention to British Cabinet Reorganization; Believes It Will Accelerate the Promotion of Military Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] According to the aviation reporter of the "Daily Telegraph," after Britain's production of military aircraft increased by 400 per month, it is almost the same as Germany's production rate. The reporter said, "Due to the official silence on the military expansion plan, outsiders have underestimated the progress of Britain's national defense. In fact, the Ministry of Aviation has rapidly completed the expansion of the air force. The number of regular air force pilots has now reached 5,800, and another 1,800 are in training. If the number of civil aviation personnel is included, it may soon reach 10,000." [Reuters, Paris, 29th] The reorganization of the British cabinet has attracted close attention here, especially the transfer of Sir Shadforth Field to the post of Minister of Defense. "The purpose of this move is obviously to prepare to accelerate the promotion of the military expansion plan," said the Transcendent News. A suspect committed suicide after being arrested.</p>

<h3>All India Congress; Left Wing Wins; Bose Elected Chairman; Gandhi Warns Farmers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Left-wing leader Bose was elected chairman of the All India Congress today. This move was unexpected and caused Gandhi's failure, because Gandhi had fully supported right-wing leader Sattamaya, who was generally considered to be sure to be elected. The result of this move is likely to cause a divergence of opinion between the Congress and the All India Federation. However, the British government is now working hard to mediate between the right wing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Neru said at the All India Congress Committee in Lucknow today that India may face a crisis in a few weeks. Gandhi said to the farmers at the Fana Memorial Movement to return confiscated land in 1930 that the farmers should be prepared to lose their land again soon.</p>

<h3>Catalonia Lines; Spanish Rebels Continue to Attack; De Facto Recognition of Rebel Government Said; Roosevelt Does Not Intend to Take This Action</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Barcelona, 30th] Yesterday, the Spanish rebels continued to attack at various points on the Catalonia front line. The Ugar troops have now advanced to the town of Baja. The government troops only offered slight resistance. However, the area is mountainous and there are only a few very uneven roads. On the central front, the rebels have occupied the town of Moirar, the intersection of the Manresa and Vich roads. As for the troops led by General Vega, they continued to attack along the coast yesterday, but there are no reports of the locations reached by the vanguard. The rebel headquarters estimates that since the start of the Catalonia war, the government troops have suffered losses of about 100,000 men, including 67,400 captured. Yesterday, rebel aircraft attacked the town of Alger in the province of Arder, dropping many bombs. It is reported that about twelve important buildings were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Salamanca, 30th] The Spanish rebels have continued to advance and occupy an area of about nine kilometers in the past 24 hours. The government troops counterattacked in the central part of the Catalonia line, but were repulsed.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Perpignan, 30th] A tunnel one kilometer long in the town of Corb on the Spanish border connects to the town of Cerbère on the French border. A major tragedy occurred in the tunnel yesterday. Suddenly, rumors spread that the Spanish rebels had arrived in the town of Corb. At that time, government troops and the general public rushed to the tunnel to take shelter, scrambling to be first. As a result, in the pitch-black tunnel, children and women were trampled to death.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] According to observers in diplomatic circles, although domestic and some Latin American forces have recently intensified their demands for the US government to de facto recognize the Franco government, President Roosevelt is not yet prepared to take this action. When Congress considers Roosevelt's defense plan in the coming weeks, the development of the Spanish situation will be of great importance. Democratic Congressman John McCormick sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, requesting that the government immediately recognize the Franco government because "two million of the twenty-four million Spaniards are already seeking Franco's rule." A government spokesman said that the leaders of Congress have stated that they do not want to discuss this matter. Some believe that although Franco has occupied Barcelona, he has not yet completely subdued the government troops, and others believe that this issue is too delicate to be debated publicly. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that this matter is entirely within the scope of the President's prerogative and is not something that Congress can interfere with. "The President has the right to recognize any government and it has nothing to do with Congress, so I cannot criticize it." Senators Borah and Tom Connally also expressed the same views. According to informed sources, the Catholic faction has been secretly urging the government to recognize the Franco government, but has not yet made a formal declaration.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th] The French press is debating the issue of France sending a diplomatic representative to Burgos. Former Prime Minister Blum published an article yesterday criticizing the inappropriateness of establishing diplomatic relations with the Spanish rebels. The left-wing newspaper said that the current situation makes it necessary to begin diplomatic relations with the Spanish National Government as soon as possible. The Martin newspaper said that the late President Wilson once said that the most heartbreaking thing about pacifists is their stupidity because they are deceived by warmongers.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Birthday; Philippine Islands Celebrate Enthusiastically; Quezon and Others Participate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] The major cities of the Philippine Islands are celebrating President Roosevelt's 57th birthday tonight, holding six major dances. President Quezon, US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt, and hundreds of other American and Filipino celebrities will participate.

<h3>German-Czech Economic Talks; Scheduled to Be Held This Week; Discuss Czech Industry with Sudetenland; German-Soviet Trade Talks Continue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] The Czech Minister of Commerce will come here in the middle of next week to hold important economic talks. It is understood that the main purpose of the discussion is to discuss how to end the industrial competition between the Czech Republic and the Sudetenland. At the same time, the German-Soviet trade talks are still ongoing. However, it is generally claimed that the talks only relate to implementation procedures and that the original agreement between the two countries will not be changed.</p>
<h3>All India Muslim League; Telegram to Chamberlain; Requests Permission for Muslim Representatives to Participate in Palestine Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 29th] Jinnah, chairman of the All India Muslim League, today telegraphed Prime Minister Chamberlain, requesting permission for Muslim representatives to participate in the Palestine Conference, stating that the British government should grant the demands of the Arabs, otherwise, if the conference fails, Muslims around the world will suffer. In addition, another telegram was sent to Colonial Secretary MacDonald with the same wording.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] Today, someone ambushed and shot at a public bus in the suburbs, killing one Arab woman and injuring one passenger.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the Japanese government will respond to the proposal of Britain and the United States to convene an international conference to revise the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the Japanese government only agrees to direct negotiations with them and not in the form of an international conference, and requires Britain and the United States to accept several conditions first, including free international trade, abolishing customs barriers, abolishing import quotas, and allowing Japan to obtain raw materials from all over the world. In addition, it also requires allowing Eastern nations to live and travel freely all over the world. If the powers can accommodate the above conditions, they can be relieved of all their worries about East Asia. It is also heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to respond to the notes of Britain and the United States, including the following: (1) Britain and the United States hope to use the method of an international conference to resolve all outstanding issues concerning the open door in China with Japan. In fact, the diplomatic method of an international conference has several shortcomings. Britain and the United States obviously want to use these shortcomings to implement their own goals. (2) In order to maintain the traditional friendly relations with Britain and the United States, the Japanese government is now prepared to hold direct negotiations with the two countries. The prerequisites for the negotiations are listed on the left: (A) Complete liberation of Eastern nations, abolition of all treaties that bind China, and allowing Eastern nations to live and travel freely all over the world. (B) Absolute freedom of world trade, abolition of all economic barriers, abolition of customs barriers and import quotas. (C) Fair distribution of the world's raw materials so that Eastern nations can survive and defend themselves. (3) If Britain and the United States accept the above conditions, their worries in the East and the obstacles to cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchuria" will no longer exist.</p>
<h3>Sixth Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule; Germany Celebrates Grandly; Hitler Delivers Important Speech; Announces Support for Italy's Demands</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Today, the capital of Germany is magnificently decorated to celebrate the sixth anniversary of Hitler's leadership of Germany. On the National Day, all buildings in Berlin, except for Jewish churches, are flying the Nazi swastika flag. Laborers, employees, and students, as long as they are party members, are all wearing uniforms. From Wilhelm Street to the Kroll Opera House, the roads that Hitler will pass through that evening to the Reichstag are illuminated by searchlights along the way. In addition, all streets in the city are equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast Hitler's speech in the Reichstag.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] According to sources here, Nazi leaders such as Ribbentrop and Goebbels are now urging Hitler to severely criticize the comments of Roosevelt and other Americans. However, conservatives such as Goering are opposed to this move. Goering believes that Germany's past actions have already led to a deterioration in US-German relations, which will affect the development of Germany's ambitions. Diplomatic figures believe that Hitler's speech will be an important pillar of the European political situation in 1939. The speech is personally revised by Hitler, and only a few confidants know the content.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 29th] Judging from the news from major European countries by our agency, Europe seems to be about to experience another "diplomatic storm." Whether the democratic group and the dictatorial group will be on the verge of breaking or can be decided by this "diplomatic storm." On the British side, Prime Minister Chamberlain reorganized his cabinet so that his military expansion plan could be accelerated. His speech in Birmingham on Saturday was nothing more than urging the dictatorial countries to contribute to peace, while still resolutely stating that if the dictatorial countries want to control the world by force, the democratic countries are prepared to resist. On the German side, Hitler is now preparing for the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. Hitler is scheduled to speak in the Reichstag on Monday, when he may put forward demands regarding colonies and announce Germany's support for Italy's construction of a Mediterranean empire. On the French side, the Daladier government is working hard to cope with the 200,000 refugees who fled from Spain. On the Italian side, Mussolini is said to have temporarily suspended the announcement of his demands on France and is waiting for Hitler's speech to be published, while congratulating Franco on his victory in the war. On the Spanish side, no less than 500,000 refugees are struggling to escape into France, which is one end of the largest migration movement in history.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT), which was of great concern to both China and foreign countries during the new stage of the war against Japan, has now successfully concluded and issued a declaration. According to a Reuters report, the declaration particularly emphasized that the KMT welcomes cooperation with any other political party under the common belief in the Three Principles of the People. Recalling the earnest proposal made by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last year to strengthen cooperation between the KMT and the CPC, and to invite the KMT to unite all anti-Japanese parties to establish a national alliance, comparing it with the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session of the KMT this time, it makes people deeply feel that the national unity needs to be further consolidated, and that the conspiracies of the traitors to sow discord still need to be thoroughly broken before it can be guaranteed that the Chinese nation will win the war against Japan and succeed in nation-building. We are willing to shout out with the whole nation, "Support the Fifth Plenary Session, unite the whole country, and persist in the war of resistance!" We are even more willing to work together with the whole nation, "Support the KMT and the National Government, be selfless, unite all parties, lead the whole country, eliminate defeatism, eliminate traitors and pro-Japanese elements, implement the entire program of the war of resistance and nation-building, drive out the Japanese ××, and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People!"</p>
<h3>Responding to the International Anti-Aggression Conference</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 30th) evening, Hitler delivered a speech, preparing to help Italy's development in Europe. Italy is intensifying all military steps to press France, and the Eastern aggressor Japan is also crazily promoting a major adventure in the Far East as the European situation becomes serious. Fascist aggressors are more frantically and openly setting off the flames of war under the Anglo-French appeasement policy!</p>
<p>The London International Anti-Aggression Conference is convening a general meeting at this time, which is of utmost importance. People from all over our country have now launched a movement to respond to the Anti-Aggression Conference. Fourty thousand engineers in London are also preparing to hold a strike demonstration today (the 31st), marching to Downing Street to request the government to transport military supplies to aid the Spanish Republican government and boycott Japanese goods to aid China. All or part of London's factories will be shut down for this. This news makes us rejoice!</p>
<p>We hope to start with the International Anti-Aggression Conference, launch a broad anti-aggression movement among people of all countries around the world. Our media and cultural circles should immediately expand publicity, and encourage the people of all friendly countries to quickly launch a united front movement, using collective power and effective actions to combat the appeasement policy and drive away the fascist aggressors ××!</p>
<h3>Salute to the People of India and Britain!</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 30th reported that the Indian Association held a demonstration here to protect India's independence, with the participation of most of the Indian overseas Chinese in London and thousands of British leftists. A resolution was passed on the spot demanding a boycott of Japanese goods and refusal to supply Japan with all materials and economic resources, especially kerosene and credit. It also called for economic and medical assistance to Spain. At the same time, it called on progressive forces in Britain to seek closer ties for the people of British India and other colonies. This action by progressive elements in India and Britain deserves our highest salute for national liberation.</p>
<p>British people have personally felt the threat posed to Britain in the Far East and Europe by Japanese, German, and Italian aggression. The Indian continent is also now included in Japan's military invasion plan. The people of Britain, India, and China are now trapped in the same fate. Only by uniting to resist the fascist aggressors can there be a way out and freedom. Under the leadership of the progressive national leader Mr. Nehru, India has recently implemented a national united front against fascist aggression and will make the greatest efforts for the people of the world and the people of China and India. The recent election of Mr. Bose, the leader of the left wing of the Indian national movement, as the chairman of the All-India National Congress, shows the common will of the people of India. We offer our remote salute and congratulate India on its glorious future.</p>
<h3>Indian Comrades Association Resolves to Reject Japanese Goods, Stop Supplying Gasoline and Loans to Japan, and Seek Closer Ties between British and Indian Peoples. [Reuters London, 29th]</h3>
<p>The Indian Comrades Association convened a demonstration meeting, held in Trafalgar Square here. Its purpose was to assist in the independence of India. Participants included most of the Indian overseas Chinese and thousands of British leftists. The conference resolved to reject Japanese goods, especially to stop supplying gasoline and loans to Japan. The conference also hoped to provide economic and medical assistance to Spain and advocated that "progressive forces in Britain should strive to foster close ties between the peoples of British India and various colonies." General Overview of the Singapore Military Base, Originally Written by John Gunther, Translated by Hong Sheng.</p>
<p>The Singapore military base, known as the new Gibraltar, was only recently completed. It was prompted by Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" as early as 1915. Japan's submission of the Twenty-One Demands to China clearly indicated that Japan would be a moving × in the Far East for Britain.</p>
<p>In 1919, Admiral John Jellicoe suggested creating a British Pacific Fleet with Singapore as its base. He argued that in the Far East, in addition to cruisers, there should also be a battle fleet. He argued that Britain should establish a "Western Hemisphere" naval policy.</p>
<p>In 1921, the Imperial Conference met in London and considered Jellicoe's proposal, deciding to build the Singapore military base. By 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, establishing the naval ratios between the powers, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished.</p>
<p>At this time, public opinion in Britain said that this new military base was superfluous and would only provoke Japan and arouse its suspicion. People upholding justice even believed that this new base was a moral violation of the Washington Naval Treaty because the Washington Naval Treaty stipulated a ban on the construction of fortresses or naval bases east of 110 degrees longitude, and Singapore was only six degrees away from this restricted zone.</p>
<p>Some people even thought that Britain intended to make trouble, but this statement was later officially denied. Construction of the base began in 1924 and was not fully completed until fifteen years later—February 14, 1938.</p>
<p>Singapore is an island, 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, with a causeway across the Johor Strait connecting it to the mainland. It is located at the tip of Malaya, and ships to China and Japan must turn here, precisely controlling the passage between East and West. When the work was in progress, rumors spread that someone was engaged in espionage, so security was very strict. Residents in the restricted area were ordered to relocate, and all construction workers had their fingerprints taken.</p>
<p>The naval base is located on the north shore of Seletar Island, about twelve miles from downtown Singapore. The air force base is not far east of the naval port. Singapore has a total of three designs: one drafted by the British Army, one drafted by the Navy, and one drafted by the Air Force. The so-called Singapore base includes all three. In theory, this base is under the jurisdiction of the Army, with General Dobbie as commander-in-chief, whose title is above all naval and air force officers stationed in Singapore.</p>
<p>During construction, mountains had to be moved and rivers filled, costing a total of six million cubic feet of earth. As for filling low-lying swamps, it cost eight million cubic feet of earth. To the right of the island, countless white wax-colored oil drums line up endlessly, containing one million tons of gasoline. Each drum is cast in the shape of a saucer. It is said that in the event of an explosion, this form of drum can prevent the spread of flames. Underground are armories, so rich in storage that they can turn the entire base into powder and more.</p>
<p>The naval base covers an area of 21 square miles. Its main grade items are two huge and extraordinary docks, a floating dock, and a repair dock. In the event of naval action, if ships are damaged, even the largest warships can be repaired in the dock. If there were no Singapore base, damaged ships would have to be assembled all the way to Bombay. By the time they were assembled and returned, the war might have already ended.</p>
<p>This floating dock is about 900 feet long and about 200 feet wide. It is the third largest floating dock in the world. It can carry any huge warship and still float. It can accommodate 60,000 people standing inside. This dock was built in Britain. Disassembled into several parts and towed from Woolwich to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles. Eight Dutch tugs were used for towing, making it one of the great sights of the modern navy.</p>
<p>The repair dock is slightly larger than the floating dock, about 1,000 feet long. It took six years to complete and cost 5 million gold dollars, using 4.5 million cubic feet of mixed concrete. Any ship in the world can be placed at will. The most recent test proved that it can hold 68 million gallons of water.</p>
<p>That floating dock can be moved elsewhere when necessary, such as the Hong Kong repair dock which cannot be moved. Near the two large docks, there are machine factories, power plants, storage warehouses, and one of the largest cranes east of the Suez Canal. Everything is doubled, except for the crane, so when × planes come to attack – assuming they break through the air defense line – they must do two sets of head work.</p>
<p>The only shortcoming of Singapore is that there are many reefs in the vicinity, making it inconvenient for submarine activity. However, × people's submarines, once near Singapore, will of course encounter the same difficulties.</p>
<p>Singapore's air force base is also very powerful, with three different military aircraft Youngs and a civil airport. The civil airport was opened in June 1937, costing 5.25 million US dollars, and built on a newly opened national land on the edge of the bay, so land and seaplanes can be used for both purposes. Another advantage of this airport is that it is very close to the prosperous area of Singapore, and it takes only seven minutes to reach by car.</p>
<p>One of the main military airports also has equipment for both land and air force use. The excellent sea surface for seaplanes is more than 20 miles long. The air force stationed at the base does not have four or ten teams, and reinforcements can be flown in from India if necessary.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, Singapore is indeed a strong fortress. It has a peacetime garrison of 7,000, and more importantly, those mysterious artillery stacks and many forts are scattered at the easternmost point of Singapore Island, Zhang Ju, and on many small islands in the strait. These small islands are home to many artillery teams and engineers. It is said that the defenses not only include fifteen-inch guns with a range of twenty-five miles, but also the most powerful eighteen-inch guns in the world. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A Fire in Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei, Yesterday Morning:</p>
<p>More than a Hundred Shanties for the Poor Reduced to Ashes. Fortunately, the Fire Brigade Responded Quickly, and No One Was Killed or Injured. Hundreds of Homeless Poor People Sent to Refugee Camps for Temporary Shelter.</p>
<p>At three o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the shanties for the poor behind the Kwun Chung Cinema on Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei. The fire was extremely fierce, and because these shanties for the poor are built of bamboo and wood, once they catch fire, they can spread like wildfire. In an instant, they spread to the shanties on the left and right, and the sky was red. Hundreds of poor people cried out, and the scene was too terrible to bear. Later, the Fire Department listened to the report and immediately dispatched three fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fire Broke Out in the Deep Night, and the People Fled in Panic</p>
<p>It is found that there was originally an open space behind the Kwun Chung Cinema on Cantonese Road, Yau Ma Tei. Because there are many residents in Hong Kong, the demand for houses exceeds the supply, and the rent is expensive. Those who have no fixed assets and earn their living from day to day have no ability to live in rental houses. The authorities specially issued two pieces of land in Tai Kok Tsui and Cantonese Road for them to build their own shanties as a shelter. Previously, in order to rectify the city appearance and avoid the danger of fire, the authorities ordered the demolition of the shanties for the poor in the two places. Later, after the residents pleaded bitterly for a delay in the demolition, the authorities granted them a temporary stay out of sympathy. Because their buildings are simple and the materials they rely on for construction are all flammable, once a fire breaks out, it is inevitable. Because it was in the deep night, most of the residents were sound asleep when they suddenly heard the fire alarm. Everyone was flustered, and they supported the young and ran away in panic. As for the cause of the fire, it is not known who left the fire.</p>
<p>150 Shanties Were Burned Down</p>
<p>After the fire broke out, the sound of police sirens shook the area. The nearby residents woke up in shock when they heard the sound in their dreams. As for the hundreds of poor people who came out of the burning shanties, although they had escaped from the fire scene, they were helpless in the face of the fire and stamped their feet, thumped their chests, and cried in pain. The scene was extremely tragic. Not long after, the Fire Department heard the report and immediately dispatched three fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. However, at that time, it was during the time when water supply was restricted, and the water source could not be reached immediately. Therefore, water drum trucks were used to put out the fire temporarily to relieve the immediate crisis. After the water source arrived, the firefighters immediately worked hard to put out the fire. It was not until four o'clock that the fire was extinguished. A total of 150 shanties for the poor were burned down. It is found that there are hundreds of shanties for the poor in the area, divided into three groups. The one that was burned down was the middle one, with about 150 shanties.</p>
<p>Victimized Poor People Sent to Ma Tau Chung</p>
<p>It is found that 150 shanties were unfortunately burned down in this disaster, with losses of more than a thousand yuan. As for the hundreds of poor people who escaped from the fire scene, they were shivering on the roadside at that time, and their situation was extremely pitiful. In order to prevent these hundreds of poor people from being displaced, the authorities transported them by car to the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp for shelter. Some of them made a living as hawkers and were unwilling to follow the crowd into the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp, so they looked for other residences. Fortunately, although the fire was fierce, no one was killed or injured.</p>
<p>The Case of the Shooting of a British Detective on the Third Floor of Wing On Bank Begins Trial</p>
<p>Wong Shu-lun Is Accused of Intending to Wound and Possession of Firearms. British Detective Motalot Recounts the Incident on That Day.</p>
<p>The man Wong Shu-lun (also known as Lee Sau-hei) was previously accused of (1) shooting the British detective Motalot on the third floor of the Wing On Bank in Des Voeux Road Central in the early morning of December 4 last year, (2) intending to harm Motalot, and (3) possessing unlicensed pistols and bullets in a certain room of the Luk Kwok Hotel. The case had been heard several times before. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the Central Magistrate formally arraigned the case. The case was prosecuted by Superintendent Owen, and the defendant pleaded not guilty, and Mr. Hsiao Chung, solicitor, defended him. First, the prosecuting superintendent stated to the court that the defendant had said when he was charged that he did not intend to harm Motalot and that Motalot was not his enemy. Then, Dr. Scott of Mary Hospital testified about the defendant's injury on that day. Then, the plaintiff, British police detective Motalot, testified about the incident on that day, saying that on December 4 last year, I was ordered by the Central Police Station to follow the defendant and went to Gloucester Road to look for him. When I arrived, I saw the defendant inside. The defendant told me at the time that he was waiting for a friend there. I waited for an hour, and seeing that his friend had not arrived, I took him back. After he made a phone call at the police station, he asked me to go out with him to find his friend. So I followed him to the second floor of Wong Nai Chung Road. It was about 8 p.m. He failed to find his friend, so he took me to the Wing On Bank. He opened the door and entered from the main entrance and went straight to the third floor. There was no one in the building at that time. The defendant took me to the Hua Dance Hall again. After the defendant whispered to a dancing girl in the hall, he made a phone call and told me again that his friend was waiting for him at the Wing On Bank, ordering me to go again. I went to the Wing On Bank with him again and went up to the third floor. There was still no one inside, so I asked him why. He replied that his friend must have misunderstood, and asked me to allow him to wait for an hour. I refused and only allowed him five minutes. The defendant sent me out, hoping to meet his friend on the street. So we went downstairs together. I went first, about two yards away from the defendant. When I reached the third step of the stairs, I suddenly heard the sound of me being shouted at to raise my hands. I looked back and saw the defendant holding a right-angled pistol in his hand. I still thought the defendant was joking with me at the time, so I replied, "Don't be so crazy." The defendant immediately replied, "I'm not joking with you, raise your hands quickly." I ignored him and took two more steps, and then I heard an explosion. I also felt a sharp pain in my neck. I endured the pain and pushed the defendant away. I heard another explosion at the time, and I was so painful that I could not support myself and fell down. I vaguely saw the defendant running downstairs madly. I shouted, but I couldn't make a sound. I took out a police whistle to call the police, but the sound was not loud, and no one came upstairs. Later, I managed to walk to the basement and saw that the horizontal iron gate was locked. Later, the watchman of the bank opened the gate for me to go out, and then two Indian officers helped me onto an ambulance and sent me to the hospital for treatment. Then, Wing On Bank watchman Yuen Tsui testified. At about 5 pm, the judge adjourned the case until 2:30 pm today.</p>

<p>Two Fishing Boats Robbed by × Again</p>
<p>One Searched and Robbed and Then Disappeared. One Lost About $200 Worth of Goods.</p>
<p>The number of reports of × warships robbing our fishing boats is increasing daily. On the 22nd of this month, another boat was robbed in ××× and has not returned to port yet. Only a cargo boat that happened to pass by witnessed the situation. According to the boat, it left Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, on the 24th of this month and sailed to near ×××× the next afternoon. It saw a fishing boat being searched and robbed by a × small iron tugboat. The boat was afraid of being harmed, so it increased its speed and escaped. Fortunately, it was not discovered by the × warship. It only returned to port yesterday. As for the robbed fishing boat, it has not returned to port yet. It is thought that it has been robbed by the × warship together with the boat. According to a fisherman who went to the Fishermen's Association yesterday, his boat was working normally in ××× on the 25th of this month when suddenly a × warship came towards him. When the × warship approached, it sent five × soldiers with long guns to jump onto his boat. They first asked if his boat was hiding military firearms, and then searched and robbed everything. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××× and gave him two ridiculous leaflets. He only returned to this port yesterday and went to the place to report the case. The loss in this incident was about $200.</p>

<h3>The Practice of Popularizing Drama</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>Joint Public Performance by the Youth Drama Association - Hoping They Grow Through Practice and Learning</p>
<p>Special Article by This Newspaper</p>
<p>Young friends with passion and energy are lovable and respectable. Although in their growth process, they sometimes inevitably exhibit "infantile" tendencies. However, as long as you step into the youth ranks and see the active and progressive attitude of the young cadres, you will surely sigh, "After all, the younger generation is to be feared!" - especially when the vast and alert youth group enthusiastically and sincerely participates in the national liberation struggle.</p>
<p>For the youth of Hong Kong, ×××××××, the drama movement seems to be the place where their spirit and work are entrusted. Stimulated by the sounds of the Anti-Japanese War, the small "××××" in Hong Kong suddenly saw the rise of over twenty youth drama groups, large and small. This matter has given us a sudden realization, and under the urgent demands of improving work efficiency on the front lines of the war, various youth drama groups in Hong Kong have actually joined hands to organize a unified general organization - the Hong Kong and Kowloon Youth Drama Association. This is another piece of gratifying news!</p>
<p>In order to commemorate ××× and promote the popularization of drama, the association started public performances for three consecutive nights at the South China Middle School auditorium, inviting the public. The reporter went to visit the previous night, filled with excitement. Scenery, reception, maintaining order, preparing for the performance... Young men and women were busily working hard, and their lively performance evoked the memories of those who had lost their youth.</p>
<p>Several hundred spectators packed the narrow auditorium almost to capacity. The noisy sounds only quieted down at the opening.</p>
<p>After saluting the national flag and silently mourning the ××× soldiers, the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting, speaking about the principles of drama coordinating with the Anti-Japanese War and the unity of young people. Finally, he expressed that in order to implement collectivist self-education, he hoped that the guests would provide more criticism in their post-performance review meeting. This spirit of courageously seeking progress is naturally worthy of our deep sympathy.</p>
<p>The entertainment began with the choral performance by the Chung Hwa Book Company choir. Among them, the "××× Commemoration Song" and "One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement Song" were both meaningful and very pleasant new songs.</p>
<p>The first act was "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" by the Red and White Drama Society. Each performer was very serious and devoted. The only shortcoming was that the voices of the male and female plainclothes team members were not loud enough. The script was a modification of "The Last Resort," but it was not as tense and poignant as the original script.</p>
<p>The second act was "××××" by the Ding Chou Drama Society. ××××××××××××, this was a rather successful place in the performers' skills, and the ending scene of ××××××× was also very tense.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, they were busy with setting up the scenery, and in front of the stage, the Chung Hwa Book Company choir was divided into four small teams to take turns singing. The spirit of hard work and seriousness was good, but the number of people was too small, and the sound was far less majestic than the group singing.</p>
<p>When singing the memorial song to commemorate the Anti-Japanese War martyrs, the entire audience stood solemnly in silence. - Building a triumphal arch with white bones, and irrigating the flowers of freedom with fresh blood, what great soldiers of the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<p>Then, the third act began, which was "Blind Mute's Hatred" by the Whirlwind Drama Society. In terms of the script itself and the acting skills, they were originally very good. However, after they modified the script, it became quite different from the original plot, and it was not as good as the original work!</p>
<p>The last act was "Reunion" by the Lu Feng Drama Society. Ding Ling's script is quite profound, and the new style of side views and curves overcomes the formulaic nature of national defense scripts. The actors' expressions were moving enough, and the performance skills were also quite mature. Although they were speaking in Mandarin, the entire audience remained silent, which was truly touching.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the performances of the four acts were all quite above the standard. The simple scenery and the way it swayed around were common shortcomings, which may also be due to the lack of material conditions. It is said that each drama group contributed one or two dollars to make up the minimum expenses, and achieving such results is already commendable.</p>
<p>This evening, the performance ended happily at midnight. There were continued performances last night and tonight, and it is planned to promote the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement in the theater.</p>
<p>After this performance, they will surely humbly accept valuable lessons in practice and learning, and grow even more robustly!</p>
<h3>The Women's Comfort Association Welcomes Overseas Chinese Representatives from Hainan</h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>He Xiangning's Generous Speech - Full of Encouragement</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>It was a rare grand gathering! Yesterday afternoon, the Women's Comfort Association held a reception at the St. Francis Hotel to welcome the group of enthusiastic Hainanese overseas Chinese representatives who had returned from overseas after traveling thousands of miles. Mr. He Xiangning, Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, and the Hainanese representatives... delivered passionate speeches one after another. The faces of over a hundred people at the meeting were filled with enthusiasm and excitement!</p>
<p>Just as the clock struck four, the Hainanese overseas Chinese delegation arrived in a continuous stream. Mr. He Xiangning and Mrs. Chen Mingshu were already waiting in the hall, standing up to greet them with smiles. Old and young, they sat scattered in the living room, chatting idly. Suddenly, a representative walked out from the crowd and asked Mr. He Xiangning to write in a commemorative album. Then you wrote, and he wrote, and they simply launched a general mobilization, surrounding her tightly. She wrote in one book after another, extremely invigorated. When she took her seat, she was still holding the writing brush, which made everyone laugh!</p>
<p>Two long tables, covered with white cloth, were decorated with colorful flower strips. Mrs. Zhang Le-yi, the wife of Mr. Song Ziwen, and Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, sat on the left and right of the main table, respectively, with Mr. He Xiangning assisting in the center. In the middle was a bouquet of blood-red chrysanthemums, symbolizing the loyal blood shed by every good son and daughter of the Chinese nation for their motherland!</p>
<p>In that joyful atmosphere, He Xiangning stood up with a smile and said: "Respected comrades of the Hainanese overseas Chinese who are enthusiastically saving the country and their hometown, who knows that before the Republic of China was founded, overseas Chinese compatriots contributed money and efforts to overthrow the Qing Dynasty... Overseas Chinese compatriots were truly founding heroes. I would like to first represent the people of the country and express my utmost gratitude to the enthusiastic overseas Chinese compatriots!" She paused and continued: "Today, foreign [aggressors] are trampling on the beautiful rivers and mountains of the Chinese nation, and they are suffering from devastation. The survival of the nation is at stake. I hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will further develop their old spirit, rise up enthusiastically, contribute money and efforts to help the Anti-Japanese War, help rescue soldiers, help relieve refugees, and help revive the nation!" She became more excited with each sentence, and more sincere with each sentence. She concluded her speech amidst warm applause. She sat down, panting, and everyone was looking at her kind face covered by the black woolen hat!</p>
<p>Then, Miss Lingyi, the daughter of President Kong, delivered a welcome speech. At first, she spoke very gently, but later she became more and more excited, so excited that her face turned red. She solemnly stated that the purpose of our Anti-Japanese War is not only to defeat the [Japanese] troops that are invading us, not only to restore our lost territories, but also to establish a brilliant, independent, and free new Republic of China in this struggle. Therefore, we must not only [fight the enemy on the front lines], but also build economic production in the rear to lay the foundation for the country. I hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will work hard to contribute their efforts to the country. The points she made were well-organized, and each sentence clearly and fluently entered the ears of the people in the audience, causing the blood in their hearts to flow in waves.</p>
<p>Then, Mrs. Gan Jiehou reported on the general situation of the Comfort Association's work in Hong Kong in a fluent and pleasant tone. Following this, Miss He Ailing gave a statement on the purpose and recent situation of the Child Care Association, and invited everyone to visit the hospital to observe the training of this group of future masters of the country.</p>
<p>Zhuang Song, a representative of the overseas Chinese community, stood up to give a speech. He first said: "We are overseas, but our hearts are always concerned about the motherland." These two short sentences carved out the overseas Chinese compatriots' enthusiasm for their motherland. He continued excitedly: "When we go back this time, we will further widely publicize to overseas Chinese compatriots and work tirelessly until we achieve final victory." Loud applause interrupted his words... Finally, He Xiangning stood up and added: "With such enthusiasm from everyone, I believe that the Anti-Japanese War will definitely be victorious and the country will definitely be built." She smiled lightly, and then said: "Tell the overseas Chinese compatriots not to lose heart. We are very confident of victory." When she said this, she actually jumped up, breathing very heavily. Everyone listened and straightened their backs, applauding enthusiastically. After catching her breath, she continued, "We, the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China, must unite into a single front. I believe that we will definitely be able to defeat the fascists and achieve victory." She stretched out her hands, clenching her fists even tighter!</p>
<p>Finally, the representative of the Hainanese overseas Chinese reported on the work situation in Singapore. He said, "Seeing the tight situation of the salvation work here, I am very happy. However, [Japanese] goods have been cleared in Singapore, but the work here in Hong Kong does not seem to be enough!"</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Jews Hold Prayer Meeting Yesterday, Mr. A Criticizes Germany for Expanding Propaganda Against Jews, Jews Must Awaken to Seek Safety</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday morning, the Jews of Hong Kong held a gathering at the synagogue to pray for the Jewish refugees stranded on the German-Polish border. Many Jews attended, and foreigners also participated. Mr. Abbot Li explained the meaning of the gathering, saying that the gathering was a response to the Jews in various British territories. We might as well temporarily put aside words such as protest, mediation, and criticism, because Germany believes that its measures are very appropriate, and forcibly drove tens of thousands of Jews to Poland, but Poland refused to accept them, resulting in them being stranded on the German-Polish border. Just imagine, in the severe winter weather, they are sleeping in the wilderness, and many of them are women and children. What is their miserable situation like? We must today tell the world about this cruel act, so that they know that there are such cruel people in the world. [Even that may] not be enough. The duty that we should fulfill today is to save these compatriots from this deep and fiery situation. We are launching a fundraising campaign today, and we hope that everyone can bear the daily needs of one refugee. Then, collecting bits of fur will make a robe, and with so many Jews in the world, the number will be considerable. Hitler said in his writings, "We must not only drive away the Jews, but also eliminate them. If we want to preserve world civilization, then this movement should be promoted outside Nazi territory. If the Jews are not eliminated, then the worries about world civilization will not be removed." For the sake of thorough discussion, he spared no effort to expand propaganda, fabricate facts, and slander Jews. The annual propaganda expenditure reached 20 million pounds, and the number of exported propaganda materials was countless. Even commercial correspondence and goods were printed with anti-Jewish text. If we can reflect on it again and again, and know more about the Jews, and study their history and achievements, then there are many things that Jews can be proud of. And recently, the British government and people have expressed sympathy for the events in Germany and have made every effort to help. Now, British people have begun to organize anti-anti-Jewish movements, and I hope that all countries will follow suit. If we want to be safe and harmless, we must wake up from our sleep.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Intellectual Youth — Guo Moruo's Speech at Fudan University —</h3>
<p>[Qinghang News] Mr. Guo Moruo, Director of the Third Department of the Political Department, gave a speech at Fudan University at the invitation of the university. The topic was "A Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Intellectual Youth." Mr. Guo rarely gives public speeches, especially on topics related to youth, so it was naturally a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>When President Wu Nanxuan accompanied Mr. Guo into the large classroom, which was packed with Fudan students inside and out, a burst of warm applause greeted Mr. Guo onto the stage. After President Wu's brief and concise introduction, Mr. Guo began his topic with the words "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle."</p>
<p>"Because [Japan]'s education policy has always emphasized education hygiene and thorough preparation, in that natural environment, generally speaking, the Japanese have received congenital soundness and acquired cultivation, and their physique is stronger than ours..." Mr. Guo first gave an overview of the physique of Chinese and [Japanese] youth, giving us a warning. He also explained that Japanese universities, regardless of size, have physical education courses in addition to various recreational activities (such as horseback riding and archery), and students are forced to choose to learn them. In addition, there is "cold practice" in winter - cold water bathing, and sea bathing in summer. Japanese youth have grown taller through these exercises than we call them "dwarfs."</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Guo also used the facts of our country's failures in the Far East and World Games as concrete proof. However, the Japanese are rewarding sports and moving forward courageously, while we are perfunctory in everything and do not seek to work hard, so we are falling behind. But in terms of intelligence, we are not only surpassing the Japanese, but also occupying the first place in the world. According to the research results of the German scholar Kanner, the brains of Chinese people are larger than those of general Caucasians and blacks. In terms of brain capacity above 1,500 CC, Chinese people account for 32%, Europeans and Americans 27%, and no one among blacks and South Sea natives. Conversely, the brains with a capacity of less than 1,200 CC are the least in our country and the most in blacks. From this point of view, although the Japanese are yellow people, their blood is more complex, far inferior to us. Compared to the achievements of our international students, most of them also surpass them. It's just that we are complacent about being smart and don't work hard, while the Japanese can spend a long time studying a subject. Because they have this spirit, they are stronger than us and first accepted Western civilization. However, the development of the Japanese is parabolic. Anything that reaches its peak will decline. What is the progress of the Japanese now? Since the "September 18th Incident" launched the war of aggression against us, Japan has conscripted troops as much as possible, and has suppressed and degraded the bodies and spirits of her youth, making the youth reach the end of their road and unable to develop normally. The prevalence of the majority of venereal diseases is clear evidence. Even "sexual mania" is everywhere, and men dressed as women appear on the streets. After the "September 18th Incident," although the [Japanese] government prohibited young students from entering coffee shops and dance halls, strictly prohibited leftist reading materials, and required students to read the Bible and Buddhism, the results were not as desired. Instead, students competed to read "Women's Magazine" and "Star Pictorial." The breadth of their sales, even the central public opinion of the Four Great Kings, Transformation, Japan Review, and Literary Spring and Autumn, could not be compared. It can be seen that this passive method cannot stop the Japanese's years of suffering and decline. The decline of Japanese culture is naturally "attributed" to her invasion of China. Now, comparing China and Japan, there is no doubt that Japanese civilization has reached its peak and is about to decline. At the same time, we are fighting for the defense of our land, for the happiness of mankind, and for world peace, which has promoted our development and gradually abandoned our past shortcomings. And the youth are paying attention to physical exercise, knowing that without a healthy body, they cannot shoulder the current important tasks. Leader Man Gao also pointed out the correct path, the so-called "student life should take soldier life as the unit" as the foundation for serving the country on the frontier in the future. The increasing health of our country's youth is the starting point for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>As for the spiritual aspect, in view of the past failures in carelessness, the current situation tells us to be ambitious and need specialized knowledge. Under the slogan of enriching rear production, how can we enrich it without scientific research? Military weapons must also be used flexibly in conjunction with scientific methods, so in the first phase of the Anti-Japanese War, the highest leader said that "special skills are more important than broad learning," which is the reason.</p>
<p>Today, we are being promoted by the needs of the times and objective needs, which has promoted subjective efforts. That is to say, Japanese youth were originally stronger than us, but as a result of the aggressors, their spirit and body have declined and failed. Chinese youth are progressing more and more due to the relationship of the Anti-Japanese War. This is already a clear fact.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Guo clearly told everyone to constantly work hard, under the guidance of the highest leader, with the determination to revive the nation, and contribute their true talents and learning to the country. Then the Anti-Japanese War will be victorious, the country will be built, and our country's culture will shine in the world. (Ben Yuan)</p>
<h3>Mrs. Li Zongren Talks About Women's Mobilization</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yuan</p>
<p>[Chongqing News] In a large living room with simple and old furniture, I met Mrs. Guo Dejie, wife of Li Zongren. After being introduced by my old friend Ms. Zunyi, the three of us each chose a suitable seat. The reporter asked about the situation of women in Guangxi during the Anti-Japanese War. She said slowly and modestly, speaking in Guangxi Mandarin, "Guangxi is poor, and the lives of ordinary people were very difficult before the war. During the war, they were naturally even more pitiful, especially women. Few of them can enjoy the so-called comfortable life of ladies, but they do not complain, and they are taking the same steps as the men, actively participating in the Anti-Japanese War."</p>
<p>"The anti-Japanese work of women in Guangxi is relatively common. The female students of various schools and the female civil servants of various agencies are naturally obliged to participate in the most direct work, such as being female soldiers and nurses on the front lines. The female student army of Guangxi has graduated two classes so far, with more than 1,000 people in total. They are now scattered in the front lines. Their achievements are very good. In some places, they have made our army and the common people unite as one and have received a lot of help. Also, on the front lines, several times our army was forced to retreat under the fierce artillery fire of the [Japanese], but the female student soldiers insisted on coexisting with the position. The male soldiers were inspired by them, and in one fell swoop, they not only did not retreat, but also won the battle."</p>
<p>She spoke in one breath, becoming more and more excited. The face that was originally very solemn gradually showed a smile.</p>
<p>"It is usually more difficult to mobilize housewives, but in the village street organizations in Guangxi, housewives are absorbed into them like men. So when the government issues orders, as long as the village street organizations are reached, the women will rise up without special mobilization. In the past, their work was to make cotton clothes and raise donations. They really did a great job in the work of raising donations. The number is more than 40,000. This is nothing in a wealthy province, but in Guangxi, it can be considered an amazing number!"</p>
<p>She stopped here and smiled. The reporter hurriedly asked the second question, which was "How can we mobilize all the women to participate in the Anti-Japanese War?"</p>
<p>She nodded and replied without hesitation, "I think everything is inseparable from politics, so if we can add a few points of political power to the mobilization of women, the efficiency will be much greater. However, I am not saying that women are in a passive position, but that women should have political power and promote themselves. Now that the provincial, municipal, and county councils are about to be established, it is said that women are not wanted in them. In fact, this is a mechanism for mobilizing a large number of women. Women have the opportunity to contribute whatever opinions and methods they have. At the same time, the female councilors of the county council can be the center of mobilizing women in a county, village, or street. We can both express our own demands and obtain improvements in our lives, and we can also work under the various principles determined by the opinions of the people. I believe that doing so may be much faster."</p>
<p>"Yes, some people say that British women originally did not have the right to vote, but after the European War, because the results of women's work were very good, the government automatically gave them the right to vote. Chinese women may as well imitate it, but I don't think so, because China's Anti-Japanese War is different from the European War. We should dig up all the national strength to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The significance of women's participation in politics in China is not only women's right to vote, but also a way for women to contribute their own strength in the Anti-Japanese War..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Li continued, "It's like a person who only uses his right hand and abandons his left hand. Can this make a big difference? Women account for half of the country's population, and if the Anti-Japanese War continues for a long time, everything in the rear will have to be borne by women. If women can participate in local political power and directly promote women's work, wouldn't the efficiency be greater?"</p>
<p>She thought for a while: "Naturally, if women want to improve their political status, it is useless to wait for others to give it to them, or to just shout slogans and post slogans. We must work hard, unite, cooperate with each other, and help each other to have hope!"</p>
<p>Transportation and Travel</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Hunan and Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Shuai Yucang</p>
<p>1.  Miscellaneous Notes on Xiangtan</p>
<p>The Xiang River originates from Haiyang Mountain in Guangxi, merging with the Li River and flowing northeast to Yu'an County, then joining the Xiao River and entering Lingling, and further joining the Zheng River and entering Hengyang. This is what is known as the "Three Xiang." The Three Xiang flow north to Changsha and enter Dongting Lake. Every summer and autumn, the water is abundant, and going upstream, one can directly reach the source. Further downstream, water transportation is convenient. This is the largest river in Hunan Province.</p>
<p>Xiangtan is located on the banks of the Three Xiang, and is a major city in Hunan Province. Commerce is prosperous and transportation is convenient. The junction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Hankou Railways is located in Zhuzhou Town, which belongs to the county. Before the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, there was the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou Railway from Pingxiang in the east to Zhuzhou. Pingxiang produces abundant coal, which is exported via the Pingzhu Railway and then floated to Dongting Lake, and then into the Yangtze River. Regarding the county's history, the county gazetteer states, "Established in the Liang Dynasty of the Southern Dynasties, followed by the Sui Dynasty. The old city was located northwest of Linghu You County. It was moved to its current location in the Tang Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Changsha Prefecture, Hunan. Now it belongs to Xiangjiang Dao. The land is located at the bend of the Xiang River, and the water conditions are conducive to mooring boats." This shows that Xiangtan is a key point for navigation on the Xiang River.</p>
<p>The streets of Xiangtan are divided by "Zong" (sections). Although there are names like Sanmin Road and Zhongshan Street, in fact, when taking the streetcar, it is easier to understand by saying "Upper X Zong" than "X Street," because the working class still commonly uses this term. One "Zong" is about one li in length. The most prosperous agricultural area is the street market, from Jiu Zong to Upper Ba Zong, a ten-li-long street with numerous shops, tall Western-style buildings, department stores, teahouses, and hostels. Betel nut shops are especially numerous, because the people of Hunan love betel nut. Even young ladies strolling the streets chew it incessantly. Betel nut is said to strengthen the stomach and teeth and promote urination, but its taste is very astringent, not as good as chewing wax.</p>
<p>The more famous hostels are Jiugexiang in Shiyi Zong, Lianghu Hostel in Shisan Zong, and Wanguo Hostel in Shiwu Zong. Room prices range from one to three yuan. They also operate confectionery, food, and wine businesses. The highest level is the rooftop terrace, where seats are set up for selling tea. Every time the bright sun rises, the bright light is interwoven with the deep yellow and weak electric light. The electric light seems to be complaining about the desolation, dimness, and misery of their business, because Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Yejiawan have been repeatedly bombed. Here, air raid alarms are frequent even during the day. The leisure class is like frightened birds, and the enjoyment of pleasure is greatly reduced. Therefore, the scenery on the terrace is just female attendants in plain clothes and dark skirts, showing off their flowery skills, interspersed among the recovering injured soldiers. Ordinary people are only a minority. However, even though business is bleak, the number of people hoping to find a glimmer of light in this bleakness to nourish their lives is increasing day by day. On these terraces, there are often young girls carrying handbags selling cosmetics such as floral water and talcum powder. They are graceful in manner and gentle in speech, unlike ordinary merchants. In their self-introductions to customers, they reveal that they are refugees from Wuhu, Anhui. Due to the difficult journey of exile, they have to do some business. But every time they ask the crowd for transactions, their handbags are often full when they arrive and full when they leave, only to receive a helpless sigh from some old acquaintances.</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation lines in Xiangtan, there are also several worth noting, described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Xiangtan-Changsha Highway—Public buses run back and forth from Xiangtan to Changsha starting at 6:00 AM every morning, taking 85 minutes each time, with six trips per day. The fare is one yuan. To board, one must first cross the river to Xiangtan East Station to wait for the bus.</p>
<p>(2) Changsha-Hengyang Highway—There is one bus per day from Xiangtan to Hengyang. To board, one must first cross the river to Xia She Si Station to wait for the bus.</p>
<p>(3) Changsha-Xiangtan and Xiangtan-Hengyang Water Routes—Small steamers run back and forth between Changsha and Xiangtan at least once a day. The fare is 40 cents per person, with an additional 40 cents for a berth, taking about four hours to arrive. Currently, the route between Xiangtan and Hengyang only goes to Zhuzhou, with only one steamer running back and forth each day. The fare is also 40 cents. Xiangtan-Yichang Water Route—A small steamer runs from Xiangtan to Yichang, Hubei, about once a week. The fare is 9.40 yuan, with an additional 4.70 yuan for a berth. Children around ten years old are free. It takes four days to arrive.</p>
<p>2. Pilgrimage to Hengyang</p>
<p>The means of transportation between Xiangtan and Hengyang originally included steamers, trains, and buses. However, during this time of war, with the evacuation of people from Wuhan and Changsha, and the bombing of stations in Zhuzhou and other places, travelers with a lot of luggage found it inconvenient. Therefore, we had to use the slowest folk boats for this trip to Hengyang. The docks of Xiangtan are designated as follows: Jiu Zong is the Yongzhou dock, Shisan Zong is the Changsha dock, Shisi Zong is the Zhuzhou dock, Shiwu Zong is the Hengzhou dock, and Shiliu Zong is the Qiyang dock. We hired a folk boat, planning for a week's time. We first entrusted Mr. Wang, who lived near the Hengzhou dock, to find the boat for us. We agreed on two medium-sized boats at a price of 22 yuan in legal tender per boat. The owner of the boat was the broker who hired the boat. After hiring, we paid an additional reward of three yuan. We boarded the boat on a faintly moonlit night, and woke up to a dawn that was cool but not cold. A slight north wind stirred the surface of the river into ten thousand golden snakes. More than ten boats raised their sails and set sail. The cabins of Xiang boats are particularly low. Although it was already deep autumn, the cabins were stuffy and hot between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, almost reaching the boiling point. The travel speed was only 20 to 30 li per day.</p>

<h3>Special Shipping News</h3>
<p>The "Jilian Ang" of the Jilian Shipping Company (the local agent is Jardine Matheson) is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from Europe at noon today. This ship is one of the eight new ships recently ordered by the company. Details have been previously reported. This ship is making its maiden voyage to the East. After arriving in Hong Kong, it will dock at the Taikoo Dockyard. Once the cargo is unloaded, it will sail to Shanghai, Japan, and other ports. As for the remaining seven ships, except for the two being built at the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong, the rest are still under construction in England.</p>
<p>The "Jiaotong" of the Taisheng Shipping Company has been repaired and is expected to leave the dock tonight and berth at the pier. It will resume its regular voyages to Hong Kong and Macau tomorrow. Since the ship entered the dock, its original sailing schedule has been temporarily taken over by the "Haojiang." However, according to the company's消息, due to the recent addition of several ships to the Hong Kong-Macau route, the "Jiaotong" 's sailing schedule may be slightly changed to avoid conflicts after it leaves the dock this time.</p>
<p>The "Empress of Canada" of the Changxing Company is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines this afternoon and reach its destination in the morning the day after tomorrow. After the cargo is unloaded, it will enter the dock for repairs. As for the "Empress of Asia," which is being repaired in the dock, it will leave the dock on the 5th of next month and sail to Shanghai, Japan, Vancouver, and other places at noon on the 8th.</p>
<p>In addition, the company's "Empress of Russia"轮, which departed from Vancouver on the 21st of this month and passed through Japan, Shanghai, and other ports, will arrive in Hong Kong on the morning of the 9th. It will depart for Little Luzon on the same day and then return to Hong Kong, where it will also need to enter the dock for repairs.</p>

<h3>Improving the Production and Sales of Tea This Spring (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yaoyuan</p>
<p>However, reducing the scope of operations would indirectly lead to a decrease in production, which is not a blessing for the future development of the tea industry. Only after the Trade Council implements management of the tea factories can the responsibilities among the partners of the tea factories be established. After verification of capital, the amount of capital can also be proven, thereby enhancing the creditworthiness of the tea factories. On the one hand, a syndicate can be organized to raise funds and lend them to the tea factories, so that they can have sufficient working capital. At the same time, the tea factories can provide mutual guarantees and supervision, so that the relationships between the tea factories can become closer, sharing weal and woe, and eliminating the previous sectarian views.</p>
<p>Adjusting personnel is an internal matter of the Trade Council, and there is no need to interfere. However, when implementing the above two points, the organization is large, and without personnel who are familiar with the industry and have both knowledge and experience to devote themselves to the matter, it would be insufficient to achieve complete success. The Trade Council's control of tea transportation and sales should focus on the development of the tea industry. It should be humble and employ outstanding people in the industry to fill important positions, or adapt to the needs of the situation. The relationship between tea merchants and the Trade Council can also be communicated through this, and the development of the tea industry will be full of vitality. The state's financial resources can be increased, and tea farmers and tea merchants will both benefit, so as to avoid competing with the people for profits. In addition to unifying the goals of the effort, tea farmers and tea merchants should also know what to strive for. Strictly defining inspection standards is essential. Tea inspection is intended to enhance the external credibility of Chinese tea. However, tea is made differently depending on the market for which it is intended. Theory must be combined with practice. For example, in the crackdown on colored tea, merchants must abide by the law, but on the other hand, in order to adapt to the needs of the consuming market, coloring is felt to be very difficult in manufacturing. After changing to the manufacture of uncolored tea, the output will naturally be reduced. Although the task of inspecting tea leaves is not managed by the Trade Council, the Trade Council should urge the inspection agencies to maintain appropriate contact with tea merchants, adopt some of the opinions of tea merchants, and improve their inspection skills. This is also something that should be noted in the development of tea.</p>
<p>Assisting merchants in purchasing manufacturing supplies is vital. During wartime, transportation is difficult, and there are legal restrictions on the import of certain goods. Tea merchants must use certain supplies to manufacture tea leaves, such as pigments, nails, tin, box boards, etc. Purchasing these items is sometimes very difficult and tortuous. These supplies are indispensable in the process of tea manufacturing. The Trade Council should assist merchants in purchasing them, provide convenience in transportation, or designate a special agency to prevent malpractices, which would greatly benefit the merchants' business operations.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>If the Trade Council effectively improves the control of the tea industry, then the control will become stricter, the organization will become more flexible, and with the efforts of all levels, the development of the tea industry can be expected. However, when the author talks to merchants, they are often overly worried and not without opposition to the control of the tea industry. This is because they do not understand the effectiveness of control and overemphasize their own interests, rather than planning for the development of the entire tea industry. Even last year, before the Trade Council controlled the distribution and sales, tea merchants seemed to have made considerable profits. However, if we analyze the reasons for their profits, it was due to the speculative nature of foreign exchange. If we convert it into foreign currency, the selling price has not increased at all. This kind of speculative profit is an exception and cannot be regarded as normal. The decline of China's tea industry has been going on for a long time, and tea exhibitors and tea merchants have suffered deeply. Now, when there is a turning point, and strength is slightly abundant, we should immediately wake up and sincerely cooperate with the Trade Council to improve control and strive for revival. The author has placed unlimited hopes on this (End).</p>

<h3>Shanghai Sino-Western Charity Basketball Game: Mixed Team Wins Over McLane in First Game, Controversy Over Tip-Off Leads to Overtime, Final Score 28-20</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] The Sino-Western charity basketball game sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Society, Mixed vs. McLane, opened last night at 8 PM in the Youth Basketball Hall. In an extremely tense situation, Mixed finally broke through the dull situation in the last eight minutes, winning 21-19. Later, due to McLane's protest, the game was extended by five minutes, and the situation changed rapidly. Mixed was unstoppable, finally winning 28-20. The first half ended in a 10-10 tie. The audience was generous, and the basketball hall was declared full, with an estimated 600+ guests. Mixed gathered the elites of the Paramount, Hualian, and Guoguang, while McLane was a combination of the Red and Gold teams. The evenly matched teams were like a replay of the Sino-American charity game in the Shen Bao Cup, but McLane lacked the ace player, so its strength was inferior to the American team. Mixed's victory was the expected result.</p>
<p>Worthy of Celebration</p>
<p>The game last night was dull and deadlocked, and it was not until the last eight minutes that it was broken. Although the Mixed team repeatedly changed formations, it was always difficult to achieve the ideal level of cooperation. The performance was particularly flustered, and the shots were inaccurate. The situation was almost entirely under McLane's control. The scores were repeatedly tied, and the difference was often between one and two points. Mixed was frustrated, while McLane's offense was fierce and relentless. Fortunately, McLane was not used to the large venue of Youth, and dozens of shooting opportunities were missed. Having practiced in the smaller venue of West Youth, the shots were all thrown too close, and the force was slightly lacking, otherwise Mixed would have been defeated long ago. The sudden reversal at the end was also unexpected, which was gratifying. In the second game, Mixed will definitely be able to take it to the next level. The best individual performance should be awarded to Sun Huizhi.</p>
<p>Temporary Agreement</p>
<p>After Mr. Xi Yushu gave a report in Chinese and English, thanking all parties, Yuan Ludeng, representing Yu Qiaqing, threw the opening ball. Old Master Yu had a minor illness and planned to be there for the awards ceremony. The 60-year-old birthday star threw the first ball, which was caught by Zhou Dayun, who quickly passed it to Chen Xuechong, who turned and sent it into the basket. Then, during the break, McLane protested, saying that the Mixed team's opening ball was passed by Yuan. Therefore, both sides agreed that if the final score was within two points, the game would be extended by five minutes to determine the winner. Coincidentally, the result was 21-19, with Mixed leading by two points, so the game was extended by five minutes. Mixed took advantage of the situation to score seven consecutive points, finally winning 28-20.</p>
<p>Deadlock</p>
<p>Under the command of Mr. Shen Kunan, Mixed's first lineup consisted of Zhou Dayun, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Sun Huizhi, and Cai Yanxiong. McLane was a pure McLane Red team. After Chen Xuechong scored the first point, Cai Yanxiong's long-range shot from half court was greatly appreciated. Zhou Dayun took the opportunity to score, and Cai made another free throw. In this way, Mixed suddenly had a 7-0 lead. McLane calmed down and scored four points in a row with free throws and field goals. Xianglong quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong, but could not get past McLane's momentum. Sachin took the place of Mannell and took the lead 8-7. Mixed's situation was very unfavorable, the cooperation was out of sync, and the team was entirely under McLane's artillery fire. Dayun made a free throw to tie the score 8-8, and Moore scored again to make it 10-8. At this time, McLane fielded the entire team. Both sides had very few opportunities to score, and the first half ended in a 10-10 tie.</p>
<p>Spring Clouds Unfolding</p>
<p>In the second half, Kong Guangyi replaced Zhou Dayun, while McLane still fielded the entire team, and the game became a seesaw battle again. McLane missed many opportunities. Mixed quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong with Kong Guangyi, and the situation suddenly improved. One throw by Xianglong gave them a one-point lead at 14-13. McLane's Red team fielded the entire team again. Dayun also replaced Xianglong. The game suddenly unfolded like spring clouds, with Cai, Li, and Xuechong quickly making contributions, creating an extremely advantageous lead of 20-15 and 21-17. Unexpectedly, one throw by Sachin made it 21-19, leading to a five-minute extension. In these last five minutes, Mixed did not give McLane a chance to recover. Dama made a free throw first, and Yanxiong made a half-court shot. Both players then added two points each. McLane only had Burnt make two free throws out of one. The final score was 28-20.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Relief Society Football Charity Match to Proceed as Scheduled; Hui Tang May Reschedule Trip to Shanghai for Early March and Play Two More Matches</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondent) The charity football match organized by the International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been scheduled for two matches on the 20th and 21st of next month. The venue has been confirmed with Yiyuan. However, due to Li Huitang's postponement of his trip north, a problem arose. The organizing committee telegraphed Mr. Li yesterday, the 25th, urging him to arrive in Shanghai as originally scheduled, and scheduled a meeting of the executive committee for 5:00 PM on the 26th at the International Relief Committee on the third floor of the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA to discuss all matters. It is understood that if Mr. Li arrives in Shanghai in early March, the two matches on the 20th and 21st of next month will still proceed as scheduled, and negotiations will be held with Yiyuan authorities to arrange two more matches on March 4th and 5th.</p>

<h3>Recruiting Troops and Buying Horses</h3>
<p>Since responding to the reporter's volleyball charity match, the alumni volleyball team of Han Ying English Royal School has been reorganizing its troops, preparing horses, and sharpening its weapons. Recognizing that its strength is not yet sufficient and with war approaching, the team is not only intensifying training but also recruiting troops and buying horses, calling upon former comrades-in-arms. Remote transport athlete Lu Kangyuan, Wu Zhuoliu, National Games representatives Li Zhen, Li Jinqi, and Yuan Bingqiu have all come forward to serve. Ouyang Shaotang has also joined the team. Recently, Chen Shichang has also expressed interest in joining the battle. The team's current strength is quite formidable. Once the date for the finals is set, they will first arrange matches with various friendly teams.</p>
<h3>The Most Suitable Sports for Women</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuecheng</p>
<p>As for freehand exercises, gymnastic apparatus, swimming, walking, cycling, tennis, shooting, basketball, hockey, dancing, canoeing, polo, archery, horse riding, driving, skiing, skating, and badminton, etc., are all very beneficial to women in moderation.</p>
<p>In general, any sport is unsuitable for women if it is overdone. Therefore, one should try to avoid excessive fatigue during exercise. The harm of overexertion is even greater than the lack of exercise. The most effective exercise for women is one that requires "qi," or endurance, while the "strength" aspect should be moderate.</p>
<p>Freehand exercises, gymnastic apparatus, and swimming can be said to be the most ideal exercises for women. Walking is also an excellent outdoor exercise, which has great benefits for improving health. Regarding track and field events, except for pole vaulting and hammer throw, if appropriate equipment is used and it is not overdone, it is also suitable for women. The purpose is to train the body and make it develop evenly, paying attention to the posture of the exercise and not focusing on winning or losing.</p>
<p>Pole vaulting is not suitable for women because the body must withstand a significant impact when landing, which has a great impact on the internal organs. For the same reason, whether high jump, long jump, or even running are suitable for women is questionable if the focus is only on winning or losing and the posture of the exercise is ignored.</p>
<p>Although sports such as tennis and swimming are most suitable for women, if their physical structure and mental characteristics are not suitable for these sports, they should not be forced to engage in them. They must choose their sports based on their individual physical structures and mental characteristics, and then receive appropriate and careful guidance, progressing gradually and steadily. In this way, they will have a firm perseverance in their sports, be able to actively engage in them, and have a deep understanding of the importance of their health, their bodies, and their mental abilities.</p>
<p>If women want to reap the greatest benefits from exercise, they must carefully study the relationship between themselves and the sports they choose.</p>
<p>Apart from freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus, the commonly known most suitable sports for women are not suitable for every woman. Freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus are not only suitable for every woman, but also more effective than any other sport. However, to achieve the greatest effect, one must engage in freehand exercises and gymnastic apparatus on the one hand, and choose a sport that suits each individual's mind and body from among the various sports suitable for women.

<h3>Table Tennis Relief Fundraiser Meeting Tonight</h3>
<p>The table tennis competition organized by the Table Tennis Relief Fundraiser has ended for quite some time. The team championship was won by the Confucius Society, the women's championship by the Silver Star Society, the men's singles championship by Xiao Zhaoqiu, and the women's by Yang Xiaobin. However, the award ceremony has not been held because the commemorative plaques for each team and the commemorative badges for individuals have not yet been made. It is learned that the association intends to complete the procedures as soon as possible, and will hold a meeting at the Confucius Society at 7:30 PM today to discuss the award ceremony and the progress of collecting commemorative badges for each team and individual, in order to determine the date of the award ceremony.</p>

<h3>Movies and Drama</h3>
<p>Entertainment……Beau Hunks</p>
<p>Beau Hunks</p>
<p>This is a Laurel and Hardy film from several years ago. It is now being re-released with a new copy. Among all of Laurel and Hardy's works, this one is slightly less successful. The film is not very long, and the content is not very rich. In the film, the fat Hardy is frustrated and heartbroken, so he enlists in the army and is sent to Africa. During a desert march, the two get lost but end up saving a besieged city from the natives. Laurel and Hardy maintain their consistent style, and the jokes they create are enough to make the audience laugh.</p>
<p>Peaceful Queen……Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>Paris Honeymoon</p>
<p>The story is very simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is still light and pleasant. The cast is quite complete, but the allocation of actors is not very suitable. Some of the actors failed to fully display their talents.</p>
<p>The story tells of a millionaire from the American West who takes his fiancée to Paris because his fiancée still has to complete the divorce procedures with her ex-husband there. He first stays in a rose village, where he meets the local Rose Queen, a little girl who always gives him trouble and whom he calls "little headache." They fall in love unintentionally, while his fiancée in Paris rekindles her old dreams with her ex-husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.</p>
<p>There are several beautiful songs in the film, sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the film. Akim Tamiroff, a star famous for playing villains, plays a comedian here, and the performance is quite good. Franciska Gaal's performance is lively and excellent.</p>
<p>Oriental……Swiss Miss</p>
<p>Swiss Miss</p>
<p>The story is very simple, telling about two rat trap salesmen (Laurel and Hardy) who suddenly have the whimsical idea to do business in Switzerland. However, not only do they not do any business, but they also end up being punished to work as waiters in a hotel. The two self-proclaimed clever idiots make a lot of jokes.</p>
<p>There are two European singers in this film, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.</p>
<p>Great China……Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Everybody Sing</p>
<p>Starring Judy Garland. Although her singing voice is not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, she is also an outstanding talent among the newcomers. The content of the book is about a family of theater maniacs. The performance is all focused on comedy and song and dance. It is also a typical Hollywood musical. In addition to singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also good. Allan Jones is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."</p>
<p>New World……The Real and Fake Empress Wu Zetian</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>A commodity that wants to use eroticism as an appeal takes a stage actress with a lifelong lustful nature as the central figure of the film, and uses her role as Empress Wu Zetian on stage and her licentious private life as the description material. The content is bizarre and absurd, but it may cater to low-level tastes. Despite the so-called erotic scenes, it does not dare to be thorough, only disappointing "salty encounters" audiences, and making ordinary audiences feel nauseated.</p>
<p>Central……Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Cantonese film</p>
<p>Audiences who have seen the previous episode will remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. The sequel starts from the pursuit and ends with the return of the Golden Chrysanthemums. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is very lax. However, there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some foolish audiences, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting the prison. The consistent style of folk tales cannot be avoided. We can guess the plot of the film without having seen it, and this idea is indeed correct. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for playing this sequel film. The set photography is still passable in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.</p>
<p>Taiping……Cantonese Opera</p>
<p>Taiping Male and Female Opera Troupe</p>
<p>Day performance……Military Lock on Moths' Eyebrows Array</p>
<p>Night performance……Two Volumes of Yin Yang Fan</p>

<h3>Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (6)</h3>
<p>—Courtship</p>
<p>The overhead smash is the most difficult technique for women to learn. Women who can perform the overhead smash must have a natural gift, so there are very few women who can perform the overhead smash. The reason is that women's movements are fundamentally slower than men's. This is a natural flaw. The reason why it is difficult for women to have an overhead smash is because of the word "slow," which often causes the high ball to fall too low before it is smashed.</p>
<p>Although the overhead smash is similar to the serve, the racket must be swung behind the body when preparing to serve. However, this is not the case when preparing for an overhead smash. When you see that you must use an overhead smash to return the ball, you should raise the racket high as preparation when your opponent hits the ball. At the same time, you should also move forward slightly with small steps, especially sideways. Only when you are about to hit the ball should you lower the racket backward and then swing it upward and forward. But when hitting the ball, avoid intentionally pressing the ball down.</p>
<p>According to my technique, the outline can be divided as follows. This is nothing less than my ten commandments for playing tennis:</p>
<p>"1" When the opponent serves and I am preparing to return the ball, I should try to stand close to the baseline, because this will help me prepare quickly.</p>
<p>"2" When you swing your racket back, preparing to hit, you should do so when the ball is about to leave your opponent's racket.</p>
<p>"3" Advance and retreat with small steps, "avoid running with large steps."</p>
<p>"4" During the match, your feet should never stop moving and should always be jumping. In this way, you will not have the disadvantage of being too late to start.</p>
<p>"5" During the practice time before the match, you should scout out the weaknesses of your opponent.</p>
<p>"6" You should always pay attention to the ball served by your opponent and to the ball you hit.</p>
<p>"7" After hitting the ball at the end of the court, you should immediately return to the baseline and the midpoint of the service line.</p>
<p>"8" When serving, if the first ball fails to pass the net, the second ball should be tossed a little higher. If the first ball is hit out of bounds, the second ball should be tossed a little forward.</p>
<p>"9" You should regard playing tennis as a great entertainment. Be happy when you win, and be happy when you lose. Both winning and losing should show equal courtesy.</p>
<p>"10" Should be based on continued action, "The End"</p>

<h3>Don't Fall for the Enemy's Trap</h3>
<p>— Du Ai</p>
<p>From the newspapers, I learned that the Spanish government has invented a powerful propaganda weapon called the "propaganda cannon." Using the force of cannonballs, leaflets are scattered over the rebel territory. Not long ago, I saw in a pictorial that the Spanish government army has fighters who are specifically responsible for conducting broadcast propaganda to the rebels in open areas. These two efforts will play a significant role in disintegrating the rebel forces. This is worth learning.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is not only a war of guns, but also a political propaganda war. Everyone knows this. Our current war of resistance is for truth and justice, and the effectiveness of propaganda warfare needs to be improved. However, some propaganda fighters lack political common sense and vigilance, and often end up publicizing the opposite result.</p>
<p>Some of our Chinese newspapers still seem unable to break away from the old method of "reporting everything that is heard," only seeking to "report" or "report a lot," but not seeking to "verify its authenticity," and even not investigating the source of the "report," let alone estimating what kind of result the news will achieve after publication. Newspapers like these are most likely to fall into the enemy's trap. For example, take the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops. The Soviet Union's assistance to us is based on our objective needs. What we need from the Soviet Union in our war of resistance is modern military equipment, technical personnel, etc., not the Soviet Union's "large army." Under its complex international relations, the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to assist China is not a simple matter. It is also not beneficial for us in any way for the Soviet Union to dispatch troops to assist China alone. Because the dispatch of troops will cause an attack by Western fascist countries, the Soviet Union's assistance to us will be affected instead. The Japanese know this. Therefore, they are doing their best to promote "the Soviet Union is about to send troops to assist China." This kind of propaganda has three aspects: one is to China. To make the Chinese people happy. But in the end, the Soviet Union did not send troops. As a result, the Chinese people were disappointed with the Soviet Union, and even resented the Soviet Union, scolding it for "not being a friend." Japanese news agencies use such tricks to break the increasingly close relationship between China and the Soviet Union. The second is international. It spreads lies to the international community that "the Soviet Union is about to send troops to China" and "China is about to be converted to communism" in order to divert international attention, make the democratic countries of the world suspicious of China, thereby provoking the feelings between China and the democratic countries, and making my international position independent. The third is for Japan's domestic audience. It can use the "storm" of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to "more reasonably" extort its citizens and transfer troops to China on a larger scale to strengthen its new military offensive against us. This is the conspiracy of the Japanese news agency and its assistant, a certain country's news agency, to particularly like to fabricate rumors such as "the Soviet Union is sending troops" and "General Galen has arrived in Chongqing." Some of our newspapers, without analysis, also publish it in a big way. What is its impact? The people are disappointed, the Japanese offensive is more fierce, and the people are more pessimistic about the war of resistance. As a result, the editorial of a certain major newspaper criticizing the Soviet Union appeared, and the staff of the communications agency of × party laughed triumphantly. Although things like relics are "a thing of the past," our newspaper editors should remember these experiences and lessons.</p>
<p>Let me give another example? When Guangzhou fell not long ago, the Japanese news agency and a certain news agency colluding with × country suddenly released the news that "Chairman Chiang ordered Guangzhou to be recovered before November 14." In fact, the recovery of Guangzhou can only be achieved under certain conditions. We are not concerned with the issue of recovering "Guangzhou" alone. The main task at present is how to stop ×'s offensive to the northwest and how to recapture the cities surrounding Guangzhou, and launch guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear to trap × people in a corner of Guangzhou. Then, when the time is right (that is, under certain conditions), the recovery of Guangzhou is not a problem. × people know this. They know that we cannot recover Guangzhou immediately at present, so they deliberately release a rumor, saying that "Chairman Chiang ordered" and so on. When the fact that Guangzhou had not been recovered by November 14 was made clear, × people and their accomplices laughed knowingly again. This kind of rumor from × people also has two conspiracies: one, deliberately release air to achieve a certain political effect; second, to cause a certain misunderstanding among the people of Guangdong. Our newspapers, without detailed analysis, also published it in a big way, "Chairman Chiang ordered the recovery of Guangzhou in a week."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned experiences and lessons have not been corrected, and our newspapers (a small part) are making jokes again. For example, on the 26th of this month, some newspapers published the news from the Haitong News Agency in a big way that "the CCP has canceled the border area and returned the Eighth Route Army." In fact, the Northwest Border Region is only a local government under the central government. It is a unit under the united front. If the border area government is to be abolished, then the local governments of all provinces should also be abolished. Isn't this ridiculous. As for the Eighth Route Army, it was reorganized from the Red Army into the 18th Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and its subordination to the Supreme Command has not only started today. So where is the propaganda effect of Haitong News Agency? I think if we look at the proposal made by Wang Jingwei in his telegram on December 30 last year, which deliberately undermines the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, cancels the united front, and harms the future of the war of resistance, we will understand. And this is exactly the new trick of the Japanese fascists to provoke the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and undermine the united front.</p>
<h3>Something the Japanese Don't Understand</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>From a novel in the New Year's issue of a certain Japanese magazine, I accidentally read a very interesting story. The general idea is this:</p>
<p>At the previous Japanese Diet, a member of parliament came to question the government, saying that Japan is the victor and China is the loser. In principle, the market price of Japanese money in international exchange should be higher than that of Chinese money. Who knew that the opposite was true: the market price of Chinese currency was much higher than that of Japanese currency: every 100 yuan could be exchanged for more than 110 Japanese yen. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? He asked the government what the reason for this was. At that time, the government officials attending the parliament, including the prime minister, the minister of finance, the army minister, and the foreign minister, could not give the questioner a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>This is something the Japanese don't understand.</p>
<p>Later, due to the progress of the war and the intensified implementation of the policy of destroying legal currency by the Japanese warlords, the value of our country's legal currency has fallen somewhat, and about 110 yuan can only be exchanged for 100 yuan of Japanese gold (which is about the same now). However, this is about the same as the Sino-Japanese exchange rate before the war. As a result, the general Japanese people feel strange again: China has been defeated so "miserably," and the "Imperial Army" has won so "difficultly." In principle, China's legal currency should be worthless waste paper like the German mark of the defeated country at the end of World War I. Why is the price of China's legal currency still so high? This is really a mysterious thing, a miracle!</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people understand the mystery of this miracle; the European and American people also understand its mystery; even the Japanese warlords understand it, but they cannot solve the difficulties in it. Only the Japanese people, even the high-ranking people who serve as members of parliament, do not understand, no, the military gate does not allow them to understand the mystery of this miracle.</p>
<p>Here, I will tell the reader: this matter is proof that China will eventually drive out all of the * * * leaving not a single piece of armor on their bodies.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's China Craze</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>A year and a half into the full-scale war of resistance, China has indeed earned a good reputation internationally. Even Hollywood, the city of snobbish tendencies, is now taking notice of China. Various war film companies are using Chinese resistance stories as scripts, and they are adopting the opinions contributed by Chinese actors as much as possible. Their status is truly vastly different from what it used to be.</p>
<p>For example, Paramount Pictures recently produced "King of Chinatown." Although it does not contain American-style gangster classes, nor old Eastern customs such as dragging queues and foot binding, Ms. Anna May Wong, the lead actress, is still dissatisfied. She demands that Chinese people be treated as equals with Americans, without distinction. She proposed three conditions: (1) Eliminate words like "godfather" from the film. (2) Replace "nose wiping" with kissing. Ms. Wong's point is that wiping the nose to express warmth is a crude habit of the Arctic Eskimos, how can it be used to insult the Chinese? (3) Filmmakers have always believed that Chinese people are either living in a drunken stupor or are foolish. This concept should be eliminated. Well, director Blystone, seeing that Miss Wong was justified and confident, agreed to follow her requests and guaranteed that the same thing would not happen again in the future.</p>
<p>Columbia Pictures recently filmed "Life is Cheap," starring Betty Furness and Joan Clerc, using the Sino-Japanese War as the subject matter to expose the ugliness of the invaders. However, in order to avoid future disputes, the company's authorities cast all American actors for the roles and adopted symbolic performance methods to avoid involving the words "Japanese people." The evil General Wu plays the villain, and the Chinese General Chen plays the righteous role. It is said that this approach is already very bold.</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille, the king of directors, seeing that all parties are supporting the Chinese, recently felt the same way and decided to completely abolish the scene of a Chinese laborer dragging a queue and dressing like a slave in his new film. Instead, he filmed the image of modern Chinese workers, depicting them building a railway in hardship and solemnity, full of lively and amiable postures.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the advancement of the times, Hollywood directors' "understanding of China" has completely changed. They will further sympathize with and support the Chinese people, instead of distorting the truth as they did in the past.</p>
<h3>Spare Me Your Words</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Across from my bedroom is a dance hall. Every night, after turning off the lights and going to sleep, I look at the neon lights shining on my bed and often think of the news that neon lights are banned on Ginza Street in Tokyo. I have never been to Japan, so I have naturally never experienced the scenery of Ginza Street, but according to friends, Ginza Street is the most lively street in Tokyo, especially after dinner, strolling through it is a special flavor. However, on such a lively street, once the neon lights that enhance the city's appearance are banned, its dullness can be imagined.</p>
<p>But for the "Hundred Years' War," it seems that we have no choice but to conserve resources and relieve disasters. Neon lights were banned first, and matchsticks were shortened later. In addition, government offices abolished leather shoes and wore clogs, etc. The reaction to these "punishments" was indeed a bit chaotic.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a report from a local news agency: "According to news from Taiwan, the gold and silver utensils taken from the people by the Japanese in Taiwan amounted to more than 9 million yen last year. The items taken include wine bottles, teapots, and old coins. They even take the gold-inlaid dentures from people's mouths."</p>
<p>This is indeed an interesting piece of news. We have a common saying to describe poverty, called "except for the button, there is no copper" (in the past, clothes were sewn with copper buttons, like the "suit buttons" that were popular in Shanghai for a while), but now even gold-inlaid dentures are affected, the degree of poverty can be imagined.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is worrying is: after those gold-inlaid dentures are knocked down, what other ideas will they come up with? A certain newspaper used "Spare Me Your Words" as the headline for this telegram, and I think it is appropriate to transfer these words to those "shameless" spokespersons.</p>
<p>Whatever, everything, just "spare me your words."</p>
<h3>Military Diary</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Especially, our female comrades also put on military uniforms and acted together. If the old master Confucius were alive, he should lament, "The world is deteriorating" and "People's hearts are not what they used to be" and shake his head frequently.</p>
<p>The small town of Kongzi River has a decent terrain, with mountains and paddy fields suitable for cultivation. There are not many people. It looks like there are only forty or fifty households, and every family is living a peaceful life. The river divides the town into two halves, and a wide stone bridge spans the river. Grocery stores are all located on the west side of the bridge. On the big wall of a store, I don't know which division's political department posted a row of slogans taller than people:</p>
<p>"Rather be a ghost of war than a slave of a conquered nation!"</p>
<p>We returned to the place where we put our backpacks and rested. Our legs were so sore and weak that no matter where you put them, they would not feel comfortable. So we took out dry food to fill our empty stomachs.</p>
<p>A group of villagers surrounded us, and they laughed at us.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at? Aren't you afraid of soldiers?"</p>
<p>"No, we used to be afraid, but the soldiers after the fight against Japan are all very civilized."</p>
<p>"Do you also know about fighting the Japanese?"</p>
<p>"How could we not know? Since the fight against Japan, the prices of oil, salt, fine wine have all gone up."</p>
<p>"Come," another comrade pulled this one away, "Let me talk to you about fighting the Japanese, okay?" Time passed moment by moment.</p>
<p>When people woke up and asked about the meal time, they were disappointed. We couldn't buy anything to eat! Let's just say that the cook was opening the noodle bag preparing to make no-glory noodles, but who knows when that would be cooked. Some people couldn't stand the hunger in their stomachs, so they went out to the street to find food themselves.</p>
<p>The street was different.</p>
<p>All the shops were closed, looking like it was New Year's. It was really too difficult to buy something to eat. There were also fewer people coming and going on the street than when we arrived. Only a few of our comrades were carrying cans of red and white powder, writing slogans like "Military-Civilian Cooperation" on the walls with brushes.</p>
<p>We finally found a shop selling sesame flowers with the door half-closed, and we hurriedly squeezed in. The sesame flowers were piled up, but he wouldn't open the door to sell them.</p>
<p>When the shop owners saw our brave actions, they were first startled, and took a few steps back. Then, looking at their pile of goods, they stepped forward and put on a forced smile, saying slowly:</p>
<p>"General, this is a small business."</p>
<p>"What does the size of your business have to do with us? We're paying money, and you're selling goods!" Wang said.</p>
<p>"No,..."</p>
<p>"No what?"</p>
<p>"General, you don't know the suffering of doing small business."</p>
<p>"Soldiers suffer more than you."</p>
<p>We ate the sesame flowers, filling our stomachs. Although the taste was not very delicious, it was already a rare and valuable food.</p>
<p>"How much is one?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Hee hee, General, how can I charge for what you eat?" (To be continued)</p>
