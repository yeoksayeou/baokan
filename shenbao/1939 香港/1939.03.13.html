<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本對英美的進攻</h3>
<p>日本最近採用貨幣戰的方式向英美進攻着。</p>
<p>貨幣戰爭是經濟戰爭最尖銳而又最有效力的方法，所以數十年來世界各大國的經濟戰爭，具體表現於貨幣集團的鬥爭，例如英鎊集團，法郞集團，美金集團，以至日元集團等等的對立。這種貨幣戰爭最近也反映於中日戰爭上。日本侵略者最初以爲武力卽可以解决一切，但自戰爭規模擴大，特別是在實行經濟掠奪時却又發現了中國法幣强靭性，認識了法幣在抗戰的力量。其後雖設立偽聯合準備銀行，發行僞鈔，但仍爲法幣所驅逐，人民不肯通用。日本原欲藉破壞我法幣制度，紊亂我金融組織的陰謀，削弱我國抗戰的力量，殊不知我國抗戰經過十九個月的今日，法幣基礎更加鞏固，誠如一般日本經濟學者所言：日本若不能搖動中國法幣的基礎，則欲壓迫中國降服，實在萬難。</p>
<p>中國法幣基礎的鞏固，一方面固因硬幣準備的豐富，但其重要的原因却在於英美一貫不變的支持。日本之佔領廣州，固爲軍事上的目的，但其欲藉紊亂中英經濟的聯繫，以動搖中國法幣的基礎，則又甚顯明。殊不知廣州被佔領已將半載，英國仍舊借與鉅欵，直接間接用以支持我國的法幣。七日英國財長西門更公然發表「英國爲維持中國法幣價格，决定出資一千萬鎊，作爲安定幣價基本金」並成立借欵新協定。自此消息傳出後，東京各報卽大爲譁然，大加批評。報知新聞竟謂：「英國此種對日非友誼舉動，日政府應即提强硬抗議，同時應對中英新協定採積極反抗步驟，並對英國在華利益加以報復」。日本內閣也卽召集緊急會議，討論對英態度。</p>
<p>另一方面，路透社北平電傳來消息：「華北偽政府决自三月十一日起禁用中國法幣，並將華北劃爲聯合準備區……區內的人民如有敢使用中國法幣者，處以罰欵，並將其產業沒收。」美聯電更傳：「日軍决自今日起在華北各地實行外滙統制。」並頒布新統制條例，强迫人民使用「聯合準備銀行」的鈔票。這很顯明的，日本已運用强力把華北各地收進所謂「日元貨幣集團」之內，此後對於英美法各國的經濟打擊將非常之大。日本此項政策施行後，美國對華貿易每年將損失六千萬元，英國所受損失當不只此數。日本此項政策，可以視爲日本對英美採取的經濟報復。日本此項政策之實施，不獨是在華外商的致命傷，並且是專營外滙的英美銀行，特別是滙豐銀行的絕大打擊。</p>
<p>日本此種貨幣戰的進攻，固然正面是襲擊中國，但是實質上受其害的國家却以英美爲最巨，同時也只有英美及早對日施以報復，加以經濟制裁，始能制止瘋狂侵略者的橫行。英美對日的經濟制裁，直至今日仍未脫離空喊的地步，充其量也不過是間接的局部的辦法罷了。英國早就喧嚷着取消日本最惠國條欵上應享受的權益，限制日貨之輸入英國，或竟完全加以禁止，但直至現在依然沒有下文。日本今日已先於華北實施對英美的經濟肉搏戰，其實施範圍若擴大至華中與華南的佔領區，英美各國在華的經濟根據將完全喪失。日本這種陰謀若爲英美各國所忍受，則可對英美不動干戈而獲得勝利；控制着英美在太平洋上的命脉。當此時候，英美應有充分的考慮與積極對付的方法始可，其關係之重大，上海大美報業已著論分析過：「各國苟肯忍受侵略者或受侵略者指使的僞政府的排斥，則各國在華的貿易將陷于絕境，在此種違背條約與違背公平原則之待遇下、外商鮮有能再生存者。」該報並且力言各國應及時加日本以有效的制裁：「西方各國忍令其在華利益完全喪失而徒提出無補於事之抗議乎？抑實行採取强而有力之步驟，予其本國商人以奮鬥的機會乎？何去何從，此其時矣！」</p>
<h3>訪李宗仁將軍</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>個人對於這時代俊傑——正七七事變以前，卽倡論焦土抗戰、自戰幕揭開以來；能卓然獨當一面的第五戰區司令長官李宗仁將軍；聞風慕義，「高山仰止」者久矣。</p>
<p>尤其新自國防建設、突飛猛晉，軍民打成一片，待機殺×的西南抗戰前衛——　西省境來，所謂睹其物而思其人，這反又處於廣西一切領導地位的李將軍，亟欲一瞻丯采，藉聆高論，以便合盤托吿讀者，天然又成了我這次到某地來的一件重要使命。</p>
<p>事先看過李將軍的幾張照片，從他那高瞻遠矚的視線，和不怒而威的態度想像去，許會疑心他是個不容易親近和暢談得來的人。可是，現在承該區司令長官部副官處長石化龍氏的引導，得在××的一間中等漏角樓上，一見如故地面對着暢談了一點多鐘的李將軍，却是臉上煥發着紅光，態度和靄可親，但談吐有力量：有卓見的一位學者似的先生。這樣更增加了記者敬慕之心，私爲這方面抗戰前途光明致賀！</p>
<p>我們那天歡愉痛快的談話，一經轉入抗戰正題，開宗明義第一章，李將軍詞嚴義正地說：</p>
<p>『我們當軍人的人，以服從命令爲天職！』語勢突兀得有點像天外飛來峯，態度却帶些讀總理遺囑的恭肅：『中國有英明果决的蔣委員長領導抗戰，而全國軍民能一致而護蔣委員　領導抗戰到底，我們　當首化明確認　：這就是中國抗戰必然得到最後勝利的一大保證！』這話很有李邱泉先生自述：『抗戰以前看不起蔣先生，抗戰以後，則向蔣先生叩頭一的風味，但此刻出自身带數　十萬大軍抗戰二十個月的李將軍的快語，意義自然更較前者偉大切實得多了。</p>
<p>『反之！』他又重重地說：『自戰局轉進新階段以來，深陷泥淖的×軍，前進則路路遭遇阻難；後面則有游擊隊大肆活躍；自國則處處埋伏着心腹炸彈；國際情勢愈演變愈與彼不和——日本除非立刻放棄侵略；否則失敗將不可思議！』如此綱要地先談个大概，接着又逐項詳爲分析：</p>
<p>『固然，×作困獸之鬥，今後還會向我作局部的進攻，又如自　自擂，所謂『肅淸游擊』，想向『點』『線』以外去染指，這在客觀事實十都不可能。每一個淪陷區，都有幾百幾千個覺悟靑年，願留在那里做政治抗戰工作，有數萬或十數萬正規軍與游擊隊，在那里配合着作軍事抗戰工作，我們新力量不斷生長聲勢日益浩大。×軍舊佔『點』『線」尙且不保，何能丹有餘力以高談『肅淸』？×軍不怕戰區擴大，再向我局部進攻，同樣仍無結果，自行增加困難而已。</p>
<p>『日本是一個原料飢饉中的小國，如棉花，皮毛，食糧，其他工業原料，它都很感缺乏。特別是煤油和鐵，無異是戰神的血液和骨幹，可是日本也大多購自外來。戰前儲蓄有限，被我們在第一期抗戰中，將其一速戰速結」戰略粉碎，即捉襟見肘。目前的第二期抗戰，局勢日愈擴大，×方不僅所需資源愈大，尤其所需增加兵力更多，現開中國境內的三十幾個師團，打得五癆七傷，因徵兵成問題（徵兵超十五期，連十五六歲小孩也調用），財政成問題，袖充尙感困難，那里再去找龐大的新軍來增加？但在事實上，又不能不再向自國人民壓榨，于是便激起人民反戰情緒的高漲，反戰行動的擴大。</p>
<p>『國際情勢，對日本不利，從英美相權貸款援華一點，便可顯然看出。當武漢放棄時，日本向國際宜佈不承認中華國民政府；但英美偏偏要對華大批貸欵，意思是向日本說：『你不承認我們承認，而且我們還要對華用實力幫忙。』又以前日本向英美買貨可掛賬，現在却「休得妄想」了。因爲日今想扮演一利用中國資源。獨覇遠東，征服世界』的拿手好戲，剛出馬門。便將人家弄得頭痛眼花。英美爲自身利害關係計，日本縱有現金也將買不到他們的軍用品。它的難兄難弟德意兩國，眞是一邱之貉，同樣在侵略消耗中，緊急時也要自顧不暇。</p>
<p>英美法蘇和平陣線的軍備，一天天向上增强，日德意侵略陣線的軍備，一天天的向下低降，將來到了非硬　不可的一日，狽狼爲奸，爲禍世界和平的日德意，亦非同蹈第一次世界大戰失敗覆輙不可。</p>
<p>『日本處於當前外灼內傷，騎虎難下的情勢中，大約已預感到未來可怕的悲運，所以內部閣潮迭起，議員敢公開質問政府，謂「近衛失人心」，謂「平沼無具體政策，可以獲得全國之擁護」，幷罵「平沼內閣是有史以來最不孚人望之內閣」。足見剛上台不久的平沼，東擅西碰，無一是　，已惹起極大的反感。同時，日本議員如此反對政府，也就是日本軍閥政府行將崩潰的象歡。再來一次改組麼？可是改去改來，內在的矛盾，依然改去不了。』</p>
<p>李將軍滔滔不絕地談釗這里，忽然沉思了一下；旋見盆中炭火將熄，便去執鉗添炭，他那黃色領章上的三顆金星，迎火閃射出燦爛的光輝。使我連想到有次他在廣西軍校演講奮鬥小史，說他以前是個半耕半讀的農家子弟，一切耕種工作，砍柴割革，甚至淸除牛欄，他都做過。他這番窮通如一，且時在發揚光大中的苦幹實幹之偉大精神，眞足以啓示並範疇一般革命軍人和時代靑年。</p>
<p>『日本也並不是毫無自救之道，』將車于歸座後復承上啓下地說：『解鈴還須繫鈴人，日本應翻然悔悟，自動撤兵，交還中國領土，于是百世深仇，一且冰釋，這不僅是中國之幸，同樣是日本之福。』這話廳在日本法西軍閥耳里，定是等于對牛彈琴，所以他繼續着說：</p>
<p>『這不過是我們客觀地替日本設想的話，當然日本是絕對不會這樣做的。日本軍閥是要蠻幹下去。蠻幹的結果，非侵略戰爭敗績，卽由忍無可忍的日本人民，團結起來，實行革命，推翻他們的軍閥。但此時日本已成崩潰狀態，痛苦更甚。日本和平民族「飢則求食」，還得向我們請求幫忙，重行奠定其社會安靖之基礎。』</p>
<p>日軍侵略戰大敬的時期，照將軍的估計：『最大限不出兩孚。』他還進一歩說：『如果日本的財政，能支持它冉打一年半的仗，它就算了不起—至於我們外度×勢，內審國情，旣經確定了的長期抗戰。則可綱續戰役至五年十年……這是具有實際上的潛在力量，和客觀上的必然條件的。』</p>
<p>之後，從改善前期抗戰弱點，又談到內政調整問題：他說：藉着抗戰燃燒起來的萬丈火燄，一個個白熱化的沸騰血液，以掃蕩內部一切貪汚腐敗的現象，可收事半功倍之效。談到汪精衛問題，說汪放下堂堂民族復興功臣不做，偏要去　×主和，以致身敗名裂，萬劫不復。最後，甚至談到廣西苗猺問題，說廣西苗猺都有新式槍械，是從前他主張發給他們的，當時有人反對，怕他們得槍叛變，其實，不發槍而防其叛變，其　等於『攻城爲下』發槍而使其與我眞正凝結一體，這才是「攻心爲上」的良策。果不期然而然，現在用得着他們來替整個國家民族出力了！總之，他每談一個問題，都有他獨到的見地，從他那讓和的口　里流露出來，不能不使你衷心折服。</p>
<p>那天暢談握別後的第二天還承政治部主任韋永成先生轉來將軍爲本報題字一頁，勉勵國人抗戰到底（見揷圖）：幷台兒莊勝利紀念照片一幀，見將軍依然那樣不怒而威地向前方勝利光明虎視着！</p>
<h3>日趨嚴重的粵省糧食問題</h3>
<p>— 梁奕</p>
<p>最近廣東的糧食恐慌達到了異常嚴重的程度：在最嚴重的地區，如潮汕四邑及鄰近淪陷區一帶，每元僅購白米四斤左右，全省各地平均起來，米價均較去年同時昂貴一倍。這特別對中下層的民衆是個嚴重的威脅：城市的手工業者和貧民過去每日勞働所得　堪一飽的，現在不能不拉緊褲帶少吃兩碗；農村裏的貧苦農民過去在新穀上場的時候，爲了還債，把辛勤的勞力換來　穀米用一賤價賣了出去，現在却用數倍於賣出去時的價格零星地糴進米來充塞飢腸；全省的勞苦同胞正輾轉於饑餓線上，我們聽到了從全省各個角落裏發出的他們痛苦哀號的呼聲，（連日來四邑，中山等地民衆紛電一區行政專，港商會及省府國府呼籲。）這是抗戰轉入第二階段一中的廣東的一個嚴重問題，這個問題如果得不到適當的解决是會大大地防碍前綫和後方的安定相廣大民衆的　戰動員的．慶幸地，我們廣東賢明的地方長官已經很重視這們問題，幷且决定了正確的政策，香港報二月廿八日載韶關快訊云：第四戰區司令長官張發奎，粵省主席李漢魂現以粵省糧食竭缺米價日漲，非急謀救濟不足以支持抗戰，維護民生；爲謀標本兼施，除積極溝通湘贛桂各省國米來源，就近接濟外，並已通令洛縣縣長，嚴厲督促谷鄉鎭長飭令鄉民闢荒墾殖，擴大本年春耕，對於非與糧食有關之植物則限制植種：並擬由省銀行撥欵一千萬元，舉辦春耕貸款，務期增加糧食生產，根本解决粵省糧食危機。我們除同意和擁　這個正確的措施外，願史深入地檢討這個問題並提出一些具體的辦法，貢獻給我們賢明的地方長官和全省同胞：</p>
<p>廣東糧食的不足本來不自今日始，特別是潮汕和四邑，每當每年三四月間存穀將完而新穀還未上市的時候，米價男子多到南洋謀生，影響農村生產力減弱是一個客觀的原因。但這幷不是不可補救的弱點。無數的土地被荒凉着沒有人去開墾；在嶺東，漫野的粟被代替了稻麥生長在肥沃的土地上；糧食的生產抄襲着幾世紀來的老方法，絲毫沒有改變；廣大的人力沒有運用，農村喪的民衆一批批地流到都市上來，被不合理的生產組織，社會組織和政治組織束縛着的人類在這裏顯示了他對征服大自然的無能，這些不合理的組織不但直接束縛了農村的生產力，而且影響到糧食在流通過程中發生種　畸形的現象：農村的地主和城市的奸商在新穀上場時用低廉的價格從農民手裏把穀買過來，却屯積着等到糧食缺乏時用高價賣出去；一警地方產米多的，却在儲糧的美妙藉口下被禁止糧食出境，使農民不能不忍痛賤價賣出去，少數人因此得從中漁利，這些才是向來廣東糧食恐慌的主要原因。</p>
<p>七七抗戰爆發後，這些弱點幷沒有克服。抗戰以來中央的財政經濟政策雖有不少新的改進，但是在廣東，這些弊端却一直沒有什麽改變。相反地由于×寇南侵，廣州及附近的一些地方淪陷，臨近戰區的民衆逃亡，×人在東江經濟進攻的加緊，因此珠江三角洲及其附近一些地區的糧食生產完全陷于破產，×人在中山及其它沿海縣份大量收買穀米供給其侵　海軍的給養，和轉運內　以操縱米價，公路被破壞及粵漢路南段部份被佔領復增加了贛湘桂穀米輸進廣東和廣東內地糧食流通的困難，廣東國際運輸綫被切斷和今後更嚴重的封鎖也將阻止洋米輸進廣東；這使得廣東的米荒進到更嚴重的程度，目前粵省米價空前的高漲正是這些因素發展的具體反映。</p>
<p>因此，我們認爲要眞正決解這個問題，「標本兼施」是完全必要的。</p>
<p>首先，對糧食的分配應有適當的調節。全省各縣各鄕應立卽進行調查儲存糧食種類，分量及需用程度，由政府或由民衆組織合作社用一定價格收買各縣各鄉多餘存米，舉行平糴，統籌分配，嚴厲防止私人屯積糧食，操縱市價和漢奸私運糧食資敵。像西江以用的地區，依據我們所知道的：廣興，陽春，恩平，中山都產米甚豐，除供給本縣需用外尙可輸出救濟鄰縣，各縣各鄉不應有地方觀念，應以民族國家爲重，照顧全局。此外當局還應設法利用一切可能運輸辦法大量運輸湘贛桂米入粵，和暫時減免洋米稅，以便洋米的輸人，補國米的不足。爲了切實報行上面的工作，各縣應召集當地公正商紳和民衆團體代表討論執行的具體辦法，和建立如糧食救濟委員會一類的組織去負責執行這個工作；這種執行機關的負責人要廉潔公平，完全執行民衆的意見。希望全省各區——特別是四邑，潮汕一帶的區域的行政專員也召集各縣的行政長官會商統一救濟的辦法。</p>
<p>同時各地要號召廣泛的糧食節約運動，如在年節不做米　，少蒸酒，少養家禽，提倡吃什糧等，要經過羣衆的政治動員，由現有各民衆團體的有組織的羣衆赴模範作用，把這個運動普及到各階層的羣衆中去。</p>
<p>其次，要大量的增加生產。在目前主要是號召和發動一個廣泛的春耕運動，第一，要大量地開墾現有荒地——特別是在離前綫較遠的地方。要把一切可以運用的人力動員起來，如大批流亡的難民。失業者和農村婦女，首先是各羣衆團體要動員已經有組織的羣衆，組織無數的懇荒隊，去團結無組織的羣衆執行這個工作。這種荒地屬公衆的，由政府分配給羣衆耕種，屬地主的，由政府負責借來給他們用；屬抗戰軍人家屬的。大家要義務代他耕種；政府指定破壞的公路，要發動田主分段鋤作耕地應用；各地的防軍和自衛團隊在有餘暇的時候也要盡量參加這個工作。第二，要減種不必要的農產物以至有害的　物，如櫻粟，改殖稻麥；在目前　別要增殖一些可以在較短時間有收穫的什糧，應付急需。第三，要改良種子，改良生產方法和生產工具，以便在同樣的耕地上獲得更大的收穫，希望省政府召集農業專門和大批的技術人員勤助這個工作的進行。各地的農民組織嬰多多向政府提供意見，如興辦水利購買新的農具種子，組織生產合作社等。爲了保證這些工作的進行，爲了提高農民對生產的積極性，政府必浪盡量改善農民生活，帮助他們解决具體的困難。如適當的减租减息，延長地主對佃農的土地批賃期，無需財產與士紳的担保貸給農民以種子，農具，土地和肥料，取締農村高和貸，由政府設立農村金融流通機關，無利或極低利息，貸款給農民，設立義學，夜校，免費敎育他們的貧困子弟等。其次，廣大的農民必需組織起來，這裏應包括他們生產的組織，消費的組織，自衛的組織和文化敎育等組織。只有在更嚴密的組織下面才能幫助他們更努力和有效地生產。最好的組織形式是像互濟會一類的組織，在這憫組織下面可以設墾荒隊，保護田林隊，看更隊，識字組，救亡室，田事研究組，游擊小組等，這種組織不單可幫助動員農民努力生產，而且在戰爭到來時，立卽可變爲動員農民參加游擊戰的組織，協助政府正規軍抵抗×寇。</p>
<p>我們要充份地認識目前廣東糧食問題的嚴重性，雖然我們的地方政府已經警惕地注意到這個問題，而且有了正確的解决方案，這些方案也正在開始被執行着，但是這個問題的解决光靠政府沒有民衆的配台是不會得到預期成績的。全省的民衆團體應立卽動員起來，擁護政府對解决糧食問題的基本方針，帮助政府調節糧食，組織無數的墾荒隊，代耕隊，生產隊到生產的『前綫』去，突擊全省的春耕連動，並在這個運動中將千百萬的廣東農民組織到抗戰的陣當中來，準備在不久的將來，展開全省範圍的游擊戰爭，打擊×寇綫續進攻廣東的行動！</p>
<h3>二千年前中國　反侵略求和平之方式</h3>
<p>— 曾琦</p>
<p>『中華民族以愛好和平反對侵略著聞於世，其所以博得一和平的民族』之美譽者，良非偶然。蓋以史實言，中國未嘗侵略任何弱小民族；以思想言，中國儒家，道家，墨家，法家，乃至兵家，無不以和平爲指歸，未嘗有歌頌戰爭者，溯西曆紀元前七世紀，正當周室衰微之封建時代，諸　割　，互相攻伐，人民反戰爭與祈和平之情緖，至爲熱烈，於是發住下述之幾種和平方式，</p>
<p>（一）管子之和平方式西曆紀元前六八五年，齊桓公得大政治家管仲爲相，管子主張以齊爲中心，保持武裝和平，一切問題，召集國際會議以解抉之，先後召集會議凡九次，皆以齊爲盟主，兵不血刃而稱覇，孔子稱管仲「九合諸侯，一匡天下』，此可謂覇主的和平方式。</p>
<p>（二）墨子之和平方式哲學家墨霍，曾著『非攻篇』，爲有名之反侵略者。墨子雖根本反對戰爭，然主張講求自衛方法，時公輪盤主戰，爲楚造雲梯以攻宋城。墨子乃援宋，助其防守。因此公輪盤九攻而不下，宋卒賴以存，此可謂自衛的和平方式。</p>
<p>（三）宋牼之和平方式西曆紀元前三百年，與孟子同時之宋牼，目擊國際間干戈擾攘，征伐不已，乃游說諸侯，力陳戰爭之無義。勸各罷兵，保持和平，此可謂游說的和平方式。</p>
<p>（四）向戌之和乎方式春秋時宋人向戌鑒於各國兵　禍結，塗炭生靈，乃發起弭兵大會，呼籲和平。晋歸宣于和之曰：『兵，民之殘也，財用之蠹，小國之大菑也』。相與發起，共策　行，其性質略似今之國際裁軍會議，亦可稱爲『廢除軍備論者』。此可謂廢軍的和平方式。</p>
<p>上述四者，余以爲墨子的和平方式最合理而有效。蓋墨子躬行實踐，助宋自衛，侵略者公輪盤竟莫如之何。墨子『非攻篇』有云：『　國之攻小國也，則同救之；小國城郭之不全也，必使修之；布粟之絕，則委之：幣帛不足，則共之』，其言和平之不可分，殆與美總統羅斯福之『和平不可分論』，古今輝映，若合符節．故其主張：當强國侵略弱國之時，愛好和乎之國家，必須共同起而干涉；同時使弱國加强防禦，糧食不足，則供其責源，財用不足，則供其資本。能如是。侵略者知其計不得逞，則自能手矣，此種自衛的兼亙助的和平方式，最有益於世界和平，竊願國際反侵略運動大會中國分會同人以此意　献於全世界愛好和平之人士，相與　同奮鬥，庶使侵略者絕跡於天壤，而人類之文明，乃日進於無　，倘亦愛好和平者之所樂聞歟？</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦十二日電】昨日此間中國大會舉行會議、由王景歧博士主席、夏博士於會議席上稱、「抵抗與復興乃中國目前之口號」、勃朋敎授稱、一日本於戰爭開始時、卽施行有計劃的破壞中國各大中學及圖書館、計開始戰爭後十四個月內中國敎育機關之損失達二萬一千七百萬元、目前對於書籟之需要、極爲迫切、牛津大學計劃於今後　年內、以價値五千鎊至一萬鎊之各類書籍捐贈中國、現英國有人建議予中國之實業、以財政上之援助、並鼓勵中國對英之出口』、前越南總督伐倫尼稱、『以日本而論、第一號敵人非中國、亦非蘇聯、而爲英國、第二號敵人、則爲美國』又羅斯頓氏稱、『蘇聯並不隱瞞繼續以軍用材料運華、及在道德上援助中國也』、</p>
<h3>鬥爭中的晉南　政治·經濟·文化·民運（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約　山西戰地通訊</p>
<p>山西，過夫是一個古老的份，但：是現在，却是一個年靑的活躍的省份，在晉東北，成立了晉察冀邊區；在晉東南，是八路軍控制着的廣大地區；晉西，又有我們的鐵騎防守着黃河，晉南，同樣有我們的悍卒。×人除了偶而出來打一下之外，其擊的日子，都是我們英勇將十的世界。山西無日不在戰爭中！</p>
<p>即如我現在所住的晉南吧！已和過去大不相同了。過去民衆們是嘆息着省「要我們做什麽呢？」「我們能做什麽呢？」的絕望的聲音，但現在，他們已經强健的站起來了．少壯的加入自衛隊，婦女和老翁，在隆隆的大炮聲下，若無其事的在做田工，小孩子加入了村立的民族小事，下了課以後便張大嘴在唱：「向前走，莫退後，生死已到最後關頭……」因爲神聖的抗×戰爭，古老的中國變成年靑了，凝固的地方動盪了，過去樂天安命的農民們，現在鬥爭起來了。</p>
<p>讀者諸君，請你們翻開你們的地圖吧：你將可見到沿着黃河北岸有永濟，芮城，雲鄕，解縣，夏縣，安邑，平陸，垣曲，舊城等幾縣，那便是我所指的晉南，這幾縣中，可是說×人勞力很小的。×人除了在永濟雲鄉佔有較大的面積以外，在安邑，僅佔有鐵路綫，平陸僅僅佔一個張店鎭，城，垣曲，舊城，大部在我們手里。我們憑着聳峙着的中條山，鞏固我們黃河北岸。同時，這座綿亘的中條山，又是我們打擊×軍的大本營，出沒無常的游擊隊駐地。</p>
<p>晉南　除了軍事方面，我們不便有所報導而外，其他關於行政，民運等等，記者須在這里來一個概括的叙述：</p>
<p>關於行政方面，負資縣政的人選都是山西省政府所遣派的縣長。縣政機構，比以前簡單得多了。山西沒有保甲，縣以下就是區公所，在公所之下是編村。編村是以一個村做主村，若干的村做附村。而村公所就設在這個主村裏面，村襲面還有閭，是村行政的最小單位，閭有間長，村有村長村副，都是民家推舉出來的。</p>
<p>縣行政之中，最得人注意的是經濟和敎育兩項了。這里的經濟情形，雖在日×的積極搗亂之下，可是還沒有什麽的影響。因爲早就施行了合理負担的辦法的原故，收支還能免強相抵。至于淪陷地方較多的永濟，霎鄉，安邑等縣是比較收入少了。至于民衆的日常生活，則因爲大軍屯駐的關係，顯然是提高了。在平陸的茅津。糧價有一個時期漲到一元祗能買麵　斤，（平常一元可買十餘斤），日用品價錯也很利害，白糖每兩一毫，要一元六角才能買到一斤。</p>
<p>精神食糧，這里還很缺乏。這一帶沒有鉛印的日報。不過因爲交通當相便利的緣故，可以看到隔二三天的西安，洛陽兩地的日報。另外陜縣也有一家「峭函日報」，在平陸是可以當天看到的。此外就祗有油印的小型報了。油印的小型報，有突擊（平陸突擊社出版），救亡周刊（靑救總動委會出版），抗戰（三八軍戰服團出版，現已停）等，都是一個小張，一半新聞一半文字的東西。釘裝成册的，有路林（犧公會機關刊）；中條　聲（犧公中心區出版）；戰地（三八軍戰服團出版）；戰友（三十一軍團戰友社出版）；新軍人（三八軍軍部出版）：陣中半月刊（十七師政治部出版）等都是半月刊，它的性質大半是給自己人看的，但是，也適合一般民衆閱讀。除了這些，就是各帥政治部出版的壁報了。</p>
<p>關於敎育，每鄉鎭都有民衆革命小學的設立，民小的敎員，大都是由犧性救國同盟會的會員担任。課程亦已改成抗×的課程了。小學生習字的「印格」，也由：「上大人孔乙己」而改爲：　我們團結起來，打走日本××」了。至於學生的日常生活，除了上課以外是上軍事訓練，唱歌。一個十一二歲的孩子，已學會軍事常識和擲手溜彈的技術。而像「犧牲已到最後關頭」；「軍民合作」；「守黃河」等救亡歌曲，這是坐也唱；走也唱個不歇。（未完）</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>于斌痛斥反共</h3>
<p>【華盛頓航訊】，于斌主敎上月十三日抵華盛頓，關敎皇駐美代表，並在中國大使誼接見記者團，發表重要書面談話，糾正日人在國際宣傳，誣　中國赤化翅說。于主敎首先指出：日方年來在美散佈『反共』戰爭訓言，以激動美國孤立派，反對美政府援華　動；繼乃以事實說明中國抗戰不僅爲求自存，且係爲人道正義而戰，日方「反共戰爭」謬說，亦如希特勒墨索里尼之倡「反共」，而實際在推翻民主政治，擴張領土，遂行其侵略政策而已。美國各報對于主敎言論俱已揭載。二月十九日紐約僑胞在于主敎領導下舉行『救護車百輛運動大會』，參加者萬餘人，四小時內募得百萬餘元美金。</p>
<p>我們希望友邦人士重視于主敎此種言論。及廿月來。無數天主敎基督敎領袖人物領導敎友參加統一戰綫英勇抗戰的事實；我們更希望國人尤其是僑胞與論界敎育界方面，都能以于主敎爲模範。擴大救亡宣傳，以正中外視聽，對於日×及漢奸散佈日本進行『反共戰爭』的言論活動，尤當予以無情的打擊。</p>
<h3>強化援華陳綫</h3>
<p>英國再度對華貸欵五百萬鎊一事公佈以後，我國金融情勢益見樂觀，而國際助我情勢亦日見發展。十二日上海電稱：據巴黎來訊，法國最近亦將有大量軍火運售中國。又訊則稱中法又經成立約定，由法方代中國運戰現在荷蘭的軍用運輸車三百輛及臼砲二百尊運華，法國專家三百人將調派中國裝配軍火。又十一日倫敦中國大會開會，英自由黨領領辛克萊號召英美及民主國家實行經濟對日制裁，工黨議員諾爾巴克則號召央國與美法合作制裁日本侵略，稱此舉不特利華，亦足以救日本於危亡。由此可見各民主和平國家聯合起來積極授華制日，已將由　召而成事實，我們一面要加緊國民外交力量，推進此種運動，一面要堅持團結抗戰，加緊肅淸『和平』，『妥協』及『齣解中日戰爭』的一切陰謀。</p>
<h3>蘇聯外交政策</h3>
<p>莫斯科十一日電，史達林在蘇聯共產黨十八次大會演說。仗義伸斥若干和平民主國對侵略者實行妥協的政策，最後重申蘇聯外交政策爲：</p>
<p>（一）繼續和平政策，促進蘇聯與各國間之商業關係；</p>
<p>（二）謹防企圖使蘇聯捲入國際戰爭的挑撥家：</p>
<p>（三）用種種方法加强蘇聯港海軍力量；</p>
<p>（四）增强蘇聯與所有關心和平之國家的團結與友誼。</p>
<p>在此國際局勢愈常緊急之際，爲全世界企望的蘇聯領袖發言申斥對於和平國家興侵略者的妥協政策，實足予一般無恥之徒听作『蘇聯不顧被侵略國家苦難』的謠言以重大打擊。而重申外交政策四點，一方面充分表現蘇聯的决不威脅他國，對於日德意等侵略者的『反共』「反蘇」陰謀、，當是一大打擊；而另一方面則又充分表明『蘇聯不能受人威脅』，又可增加其在全世界的戚信，而其建立和平國家大聯合，實現集體安全制度，以謀世界和平的政策，自更爲今日全世界所必需。</p>

<h3>一個慘痛的回憶　奧國覆亡目睹記</h3>
<p>— 董平譯</p>
<p>維也納，一九三八年三月十日。</p>
<p>是三月里，一個嚴寒，濃霧，灰暗的淸晨，慘冬已經惜別，萬人期待着的早春，還不曾到來。這一天，凡是親身經歷的人，都會永銘心底，沒世難忘。</p>
<p>當三月十日這天早上，你如果在維也納街上走過，顯然的，你會覺得一些異樣的情景，顯示着將有什麽不平凡的事要發生，整千累高的標語紙條宣傳品，散亂在大街小巷中，一陣陣的狂風，把它們播送到全城的每個角落，那些宣傳品上，便是寫着舒士尼格總理，昨夜在印士布魯克頒佈的命令，定三月十三日，舉行全國公民投票，以决定奧大利的命運。</p>
<p>一羣一羣的市政局工人，忙着在人行道上，商店櫥窗中及市街牆壁邊，粉漆政府的口號：無數的旗幟在商口招展着着：電燈　和樹木上，都繫着大幅的警惕楔標語，表示誓死擁載政府。</p>
<p>一隊一隊的愛國靑年團，在街頭走過，不斷地喊着　護總埋的口號。舒十尼格總理是定於這個早上八點鐘，自印十布魯克搭快車回到維也納的。</p>
<p>沒有一點兒不穩的影子，當靑年們在街上歡呼走過，佇立在一旁的人民，都高呼着擁護政府和總理的口號以相應和。一般以爲，這次投票的成功，已經是無庸疑慮的事實。</p>
<p>當舒士尼格總理的車子抵達時，近萬的人民擁擠在車站前面的廣塲上。總理剛一下車，好像馬上便在車站辦公廳中舉行了次會議，大約二十分鐘之後，才走上預先停在站外的汽車。他的臉色挺嚴肅，慘白；沒有向羣衆望一下，他的態度，顯然的，與向他歡呼着「奧大利的救星」的羣衆，完全不同，他的車子，很快的，便沿着馬里希發大街，穿過競技場，繞經議會廳和白克大戲院，直趨保爾黑士廣塲的總理署。</p>
<p>總理經過的地方，羣衆是一致熱烈的歡呼。這便是維也納人，最後一次見到他們的總理舒士尼格。</p>
<p>這以後的幾小時中，情况大致平靜。顯然的，當時的國社黨員，的確是給舒士尼格以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，頒佈了公民投票的法令，弄得手足失惜：這時正在等着柏林的新訓令。但到了上午快十一點的時候，小組的納粹示威者便開始在競技場一帶露臉丁；不過，大部都是年輕的小夥子；他們叫着納粹法定的口號：一個國家，一個民族，一個領袖。但，那是無可奈何的，不論在人數上，或聲調上講，他們都敵不過那擁護政府的一羣。</p>
<p>警察是很少看得見，無疑的，他們是全奉了內長殷奎特的密令，不要去于涉納粹的示威者，因此，他們沒有去逮捕過半個，只有在納粹人物被圍困着挨打時，他們才趕快去實行保護。</p>
<p>到了正午，歌院街口及肯特街附近，給上五千人的羣衆擠得水洩不通，警察是忙得不可開交；顯然的連他們也露出慌張混　的姿態。幾個警官公開承認，在過去數小時之中，他們奉到四面八方來的命令，而且全是互相抵　的。</p>
<p>在先，納粹只派些十五歲至二十歲的男女靑年們在街上胡闖，現在一批批年齡較大的也在街頭出顯了；有的穿着黑靴，表示他是黑　團，有的穿着衝錄隊制服的短統襪，但，不久之後，街上仍然又轉成擁護政府者的世界，因爲一羣好幾百的天主敎和祖國陣線的學生，突然自小巷中蜂湧出來，把納粹示威者驅出了競質塲，趕到第西區街道一帶，這是這一天的第一次，也就是最後一次，論護政府者最成功的表演。甚至連警察都是站在政府這一邊的。</p>
<p>到了下午兩點，第一區全境和競技塲一帶，納粹人物完全絕跡，一切全在愛國者整個控制之下。</p>
<p>但這幷沒　持多久。</p>
<p>不知楚何原故，那些學生突然全撤退了，一刻鐘之後，納粹又全部捲土重來。警察爲了避免雙方衝突，乃在肯特大街中間攔截起來，每邊留給半條街道和一個人行道。這無疑的，在警察的眼光中，已把擁護政府者和企圖推翻政府者，視作同等地位了。</p>
<p>這事實的表現，雙方示威者都能看得很明白。於是　　政府者。便顯得氣餒起夾——並且，他們的人數，也大大的減少，因爲許多領頭的人，都紛紛囘家用午餐去了——而納粹的吶喊却愈來愈兇。</p>
<p>同時，商店老板們開始了閉門鎖窻。原先在雙方都佔着重要地位的婦女，也紛紛不起勁了；街上的叫囂聲，是繼續不斷的接着石子開始飛拗，擊碎窻戶的聲音，也此伏彼起的鬧個不停。</p>
<p>一瞬間的沉息，靜得跟敎堂里一般。但頃刻之後，不可避免的事實，終於爆發了：國社黨員突然衝過了警察的警戒綫——那時警察是低少加以抗拒的——　向愛國團體這一羣猛撲過來。一陣混戰，帽子，木棍，手提箱，傘，皮帶等一切東西都成了武器，顯然的，一面是人多勢衆，愛國者是被逼港退向斯蒂芬廣塲，在那里，他們又作最後的一搏。</p>
<p>一個老年人，戴看圓頂帽，穿着皮上衣，好像是一個退伍的帝國軍人，突然趕上前去，奪獲了一面目一家店鬥上倒下來的奧國國旗，領着羣衆，向前衝去，他們一共不過白巴人光景，結果自那一大羣×人手中，把肯特大街大部　領囘來，但在臨近卡普生敎堂的地方，他們遇到了警察，一場惡鬥之後，他們的旗幟被刦奪了，這便帶到了一個結束，自那時以後，一切便是納粹的世界。那時是一九三八年三月十日下午三時四十五分。</p>
<p>這個時間是誰都應當牢牢記住的，因爲那是在千年之間，才會有這麽一次。在那時間里，奧大利是亡了。</p>
<p>不是在三月十一日，舒士尼格宣佈下野的時候，也不是在三月十三日，希特勒宣佈莽併奧大利的時候，實在的，是在一九三八年三月十日下午三時四十五分，於卡普生教堂的近處，奧大利是眞正的覆亡了。（譯自三月十日本港「德臣西報」，原作者具名「香港一難民」）。</p>

<p>鄧洪年報告</p>
<p>繼由鄭洪年報吿孫總理生平史略、謂今日爲我孫總理十四年前在北平逝世與我同胞永別、最哀痛之一日、兄弟乘此紀念會當中、把總理在北平逝世時情形、及其染病經過、略爲在座僑胞吿、自總理奔走革命以來、無時無日不爲中國和平統一而奮鬥、總理之赴北平、非爭地位人民與土地而在、蓋欲與段祺瑞張作霖諸人磋商中國和平統一而已、同時請求派遣幹員出國、與世界各國接洽廢除我國不平等條約、不料抵京之後、未幾、而舊病復發、竟在平逝世、總理此種偉大革命精神、實爲今日靑年們之所應效法、總理爲求中國和平而奮鬥、故有聯合世界以平等待我之民挨共同奮鬥之言、使當時全國上下精誠團結、向此路途踏去、早已統一、何待今日、吾人欲民埃之復興、正如總理所謂非奮鬥不可、當日總理嘗言、苟吾國統一之後、二十年後、將爲世界最强盛之國家、則聯合世界弱小民挨、及以平等待我之民族、以求世界和平、非如現目之帝國主義之國家、日以侵略爲事、希望闔港僑胞、應把總理和平精神、盡量向國際宣傳、俾各國人士知總理精神、是爲世界和平而奮鬥、由此可以表現我國是次之抗戰精神、我國抗戰　今、差不多　　兩年、在此兩年抗戰當中、我國政府夫前方將士、後方人民精神和表現、尤其是總理遺留之和平奮鬥精神、足爲世界各國所欽敬、此皆由我國最高領袖蔣委員長　　總理未完之遺志、有以致之云云、繼由何香凝女士演講一總理的偉大」（已載昨報）最後、冉由革命老同志徐季龍演講總理精神、至十二時許始行散會、</p>
<p>何香凝演說</p>
<p>跟着是何香凝女士演說、她這天是穿着黑點的衣服、未覆着黑色的呢帽、大家對他都非常關注、因爲她是年老多病的、每次講話、情感都是衝動得那麼劇烈、所以演說之後非休養上三五天是不能復元的啊、她首先叙述總理手創國民黨的簡略歷史、跟着她述說總理遺囑中的聯合世界上以平等待我之民族、」這個遺敎、現在英美法蘇和很多國家都是以平等待我之民族特別是英國最近以鉅量的借款、貸給我們、和救濟我們流離失所的難胞、這是應該特別提出感謝的」、一陣劇烈的掌聲、截斷了她的話柄、跟着他說出總理並不是一個擁有十萬軍隊的人、而祗是一個中產人家的子弟、一個醫學的靑年的學生、由他那悲天憫人的天性、生出醫人醫國的壯志、他看見全國同胞在殘暴的壓迫下、發出傷病人般的痛苦的呻吟、就決心去革命去救全中國的病人！」又是一派劇烈的掌聲、她的呼吸有點緊促了、但還是繼續的說上去、「諸位同胞、大概都是非常的愛護祖國的、所以我們都應該拿出我們的力量、×××××、我們不要辜負國際正義朋友帮助的苦心、和繼續着總理的百折不撓的遺志我們不要灰心、不怕失敗、大家都立着不成功便成仁的志願、爲復興我們的新中國而努力啊、」說到這裏她用力緊握着雙拳、把足用力地在臺上着、在掌聲不斷當中、她不斷的喘着氣歸座、座上隱約的聽見了脈摶劇的跳動着、專實上有些人差不多給感動得起來跳躍了、</p>
<p>末了是徐季龍演說、他身子雖然是不大好、還勉强掙扎滔滔的叙述總理的事略啊、</p>

<p>李星階談　米荒原因</p>
<p>據李氏稱、中山縣所產米石、向足自給、且有餘剩運輸出外、接濟鄰區、平均每年產額、可供本縣兩年之需、此種情形、原不致發生米荒情事、此次所以形成米荒現象者、因某大米業公司、年來每于新米上市、米價低廉之候、巨量收買、計達四五百萬担之巨、運出澳門、同時中山縣鄰近之須德、新會等縣、所產米糧不足自給、又向中山吸收不少、經此種巨量之輸出、及鄰縣之吸食、本縣粮量、立呈缺乏、同時更因×機飛經本縣各區投彈、各地米倉、恐兆焚燬、血本無歸、多不敢存貯、</p>
<p>南番九縣　同告莞歉</p>
<p>今者存米旣疏、洋米進口稅又重、土米乃乘機高昂、而米商史以從中操縱、米荒情形、日甚一日、其中苦况、可見一斑、目下石岐一帶、每元國幣僅可得米五斤、穀糧每百斤亦需毫券十二元、此種現象、不獨中山一縣爲然、卽南番順新台開會恩等九縣、亦感同樣苦况、而夸省民食調節委員會、在廣州陷落時、工作已吿停頓、民食無由調劑元縣縣長月前乃要求財部免稅洋米進口、及舉辦平糶、成立平糶委員會、着手救濟、本縣因香港有中山僑商會設立、當局爲會商救濟起見、乃派由兄弟等五人啣命來港、要求港方同鄉體念桑梓情誼、盡量接濟、現已得中山商曾之答允、召開聯席會、縣米輸入內地、舉辦平糶、接濟民食、</p>
<p>代表返澳　徵詢辦法</p>
<p>代表李德聯爲此、已于今（昨）晨過返澳門、徵詢當地所需之米量及辨法、俾開聯席會時、根據所得、提供意見、李代表赶期明（今）日回港、出席聯會、至詳細辦法、須待明（今）晚商討結果後方能、奉吿云、李氏又稱、中山所產米糧、平素已稱豐裕、今且有米荒之感、其他民食素不自給之鄰縣、其窘迫情形、當更不堪設想、本來聯合九縣舉辦平糶、收效當爲順利、惟是各區之所需數量、或救濟辦法、各有不同、故而未能一致、只本縣先行派弟兄等來港、請求救濟而已云云、記者再詢中山石岐各地最近情况、據稱、自農歷元旦迄今、縣屬尙未有×機發現、日前逃難港澳者、亦多因生活程度過高、大部遷返內地云</p>

<h3>×侵擾華南後　本港對華貿易　遭受空前打擊　本年一月份竟降至二千三百餘萬元　慘淡情形爲一九二五年後所僅見</h3>
<p>去年本港貿易數字、統計共十一萬三千〇七萬一千二百一十四元、其中對華貿易佔四萬六千三百九下九萬一千八百一十六元、約達全部數字百分之四十一、每月平均計算、約三千八百六十六萬五千九百八十五元、惟至本年一月、本港對華貿易、卽降至二千三百八十一萬六千三百六十二元、比前縮減一千五百萬元、此種景象、幷非自今年始、而于去歲十月、卽呈衰落現象也、茲將去年每月本港對華貿易數字列下、</p>
<p>一月　三六·三一七·四六三元</p>
<p>二月　三二·四二一·六一八元</p>
<p>三月　九六·〇九八·二〇六元</p>
<p>四月　五二·一〇三·九八七元</p>
<p>五月　四七·〇八五·七四九元</p>
<p>六月　三六·三三〇·二二三元</p>
<p>七月　三二·四六七·〇二〇元</p>
<p>八月　三四·五一一·九五四元</p>
<p>九月　四六·五〇八·六六〇元</p>
<p>十月　一一八·三六五·五六九元</p>
<p>十一月　三七·二八七·三七一元</p>
<p>十二月　二三·四七九·八九五元</p>
<p>按諸上表所列、平均每月爲三八。六六五。九八五元、最先之九月平均爲四一。六九〇。九九八元、最後之三月平均則爲二九·七一〇。九四五元、最後一季之縮滅、實因×軍侵擾華南之影響、其中尤以十月及十二月爲甚、十一月份雖略呈活躍、但其原因、實爲大批華茶經港外輸所致、茲又將華北華中華南對港貿易分折列下、</p>
<p>全年總數</p>
<p>華北　七八·一三三·七二六元</p>
<p>華中　四〇·六四五·一二七元</p>
<p>華　二四五·二一二·九六三元</p>
<p>每月平均數</p>
<p>三四·八四四·四七七元</p>
<p>三·三八七·〇九四元</p>
<p>二〇·四三四·四一四元</p>
<p>照上列數字審察、十月以後、華北華中、皆較平均縮降、僅華北因茶葉出口、十一一月份略有起色、而華中本年月份、亦頗有增加、又自去年十月以來、本港對華南貿易、一落千丈、尢以本年一月爲最其慘淡情形、爲一九二五年大罷　後所僅見、本海對華貿易縮減、其主因基于×人之侵擾華南、繼之以×人之封鎖珠江、遭受影饗所致、本港對華貿易、首推華南、苟非珠江很開放、必難恢復以前盛况、又廣州卡陷落前一年、本港因處于特殊環境、遂成爲中國貿易中心、華中華北貨之進出、悉頓廣九粵漢兩路流通、故以前華中及華北主要出品、悉處于本港、其中如茶葉一項已佔去年本港貿易一重要地位、去年茶葉輸入總額、共値一千六百九十二萬六千九百五十一元、輸出總値一千六白〇八萬〇八百一十四元、其中九百萬元、乃經海參威運往蘇聯者、自廣州漢口租繼失陷、而粵漢鉄路交通、遂吿斷絕、昔本港頓以爲中國商品集散地者、遂無復存在、雖對華北之貿易、仍能達到水準、然必將漸告衰落、可無異議、蓋因×軍封鎖中國海岸、而中中貿易中心、不復不移於河內及緬甸、其次×人在華北華中、族行其經濟侵略政策、對於外匯及一切貿易悉加統制、此實予本港對華貿易重大打擊、故本港對華貿易前途、殊可　觀也、</p>

<h3>東江又趨緊張　×忙於佈置　增城×圖犯龍門　莞城×增加亦有蠢動意　我軍團隊均已枕戈嚴防</h3>
<p>【東　快訊】增城×兵增加後、和緩多日之果江形勢、又趨緊張、惟我河源、從化、龍門、博羅方面大軍雲集、陣容雄厚、×對北窺龍鬥、抑東犯惠博、尙屬舉棋未定、現×動能、其目標似屬於龍門、圖迂週北進對惠博方面、僅係欲施聲東擊西之牽制政策、茲將各情訪誌如下、</p>
<p>增城×軍　最近動態</p>
<p>查原駐增城×軍、爲松田部隊、刻經換防、×換防部隊、（番號待查）本月五日起、由廣增公路、開達增城、主力集中福和、其餘分佈於石橋、朱村、羅布同、石崗、石難、新塘各據點、據軍事機關得接情報、現駐增城縣屬縣軍、均四五千人、附砲十餘門、戰車三四十輛、另騎兵工兵等部隊、連日廣增公路、增灘公路、×軍運仍忙、九日晨×步騎四百餘、出擾正果、欲試探我實力、經被我守軍擊潰、現×雖謀蠢動、但鑒于我實力關係、仍不敢妄舉、我　刻正嚴密防範、隨時準備迎聲、</p>
<p>莞龍方面　×謀蠢動</p>
<p>旬前東莞縣屬石龍、莞城太平各據點×軍、大部已撤退、惟本月七日起、×軍千餘、又開返石龍、太平莞城×亦同時增加、據諜報、石龍×軍現有千餘人、大部駐鎭內、另三四百人駐車站、M目將石龍南便、鐵橋炸燬、將鐵料運返×國　、現×在河商築有浮橋、能與莞龍公路　接、惟×兵及馬隊僅能通過、不能通車、連日×由太平沿公峰經莞城石龍車站、及沿東江河運至石龍鎭內軍品極　、故石龍河面、現泊有×封用之民船、汽艇共三四十　、莞區方面現駐×軍約五百、太平約一千、惟無甚異動、綜現東江各據點×軍、連日均忙于佈置、似有伺機蠢動企圖、第三四兩游擊區司令已奉命飭屬、嚴爲防備云、</p>
<h3>西江我軍備反攻　×請兵增防三水　鄧龍光親自出巡西江前線　我×雙方前哨士兵不進接觸</h3>
<p>【河口　別快訊】近時我西江上游、陸續增派生力大軍、開赴馬房、蕭苞、金利、廣和、貝水一帶前線、籌備反攻甚急、前敵總指揮鄧軍長龍光、且親自出巡西江前線、各屬防務、加緊布置、駐三水之×酋崗田師團　、偵悉我軍增强前終布置、大起恐慌、迭電廣州×司令部、請增派部隊開往三水河口一帶、廣州×酋安藤、接到崗田請援之電報、於本月二日、主度州方面、派出步砲兵六七百人、從石圍塘乘車出發、開往三水河口一帶、計有　砲十二門、輕機關檢廿二枝、軍技四五十人、又派偵探長林謙駐河口主持諜探工作、並在河口海關前、架築長木橋一座、直透出江中、爲駐泊往來輸輸船艦之用、最近復在石牌崗、電綫兩處架設砲位、每處安設綱砲兩門、角尾一帶、每日有百餘工人、建築防禦工事、與我前方步哨線、相距僅隔二千公尺、×我兩方前哨、不時用機關槍掃射警戒、但×軍態勢、只採固守未敢向我陣地前進云、</p>
<h3>廣州我游擊隊　攻入正金銀行　游擊隊以機槍手榴彈進攻　獲軍票二百萬×畏不敢抗</h3>
<p>本港英文南華晨報十日曾刊載、廣州正金銀行分行被劫、損失二十萬日元、至十一日下午、日人在本港所辦「香港日報」、指爲造謠誹謗、惡意宣傳、該報又謂「據正金銀行當局宣稱、事全屬子虛、不値一笑、」現大陸社據派駐衛州通訊員特快訊、証實正金銀行被刦、確有其事、詳情如下、</p>
<p>強佔交通　銀行舊址</p>
<p>原在沙面設立之廣州正金銀行、於戰事發生後、早目動封閉、至廣州淪陷、×人竟强據太平南路白宮酒店下層舊日交通銀行地址、將交通二字改爲正金、銀行二字亦仍其舊、派員辦事、×軍軍用手票、由該行發出、以吸收我國法幣、軍用票與我國幣及毛券之比率、亦由該行强行指定、目的在破壞我金融、故行中存有軍用票甚多</p>
<p>壯士化裝　挾械攻入</p>
<p>我游擊隊探悉該行爲×財政機關、决定予以襲擊、當　第一區別働隊及廣州游擊隊、各選敢死壯士、共百人有奇、先行混跡市區內、至本月八日、分頭依時抵達太平南路、各衣便衣、懷手溜彈及手槍、另携手機關槍廿餘挺、分藏于竹籮內、作小馭狀、一聲號令、各拔武器、轟發示威、卽衝進正金銀行、當時行內除職員外、尙有×軍多名守衛、見我隊人衆、不敢抵抗、各隊員乘機獲軍用票甚多、票面額共二百餘萬元、得手後卽出、×軍來援不及、我隊全數退出市區、不折一人、復查攻人該行時、嗚槍數十響示威外、手溜彈及手機關槍、絕未施用、足見得手之易、</p>
<p>×軍用票　價值大跌</p>
<p>此事發生後、×軍命假維持會極力掩飾、無如事實俱在、知者已衆、故當時×軍用票價値大受影響、查正金銀行雖定軍用票比率、與我國幣比爲加　、與毫券爲加八、至現在則軍用票大跌特跌、此爲軍用票確鑿被奪去大量之旁證、×人機關報、意國泯滅眞事實、圖見其心勞日拙耳、</p>
<h3>兩個月來　×機濫炸韶關統計</h3>
<p>【韶關通訊】昨據警察當局發表消息、韶關位處粵省之北、且有粵　鐵路貫通、爲粵省軍事與政治之中心、故×機頻飛濫炸、此兩月來已被×機濫炸三十一次、投下炸彈大小共九百九十四枚、死傷平民達七百餘名、被炸毀民房商店、及公共建築物共七百三十餘處、又去年十二月內共放出空襲警　六十五次、平均每天二次、現市民因敵機報來　虐、白畫營業、多已停頓、改於夜間云、</p>

<h3>結婚後的影星們　—男星往往會聲譽低落—</h3>
<p>暫時、在好莢塢似乎還沒有人稱克拉克蓋勃爾做「卡洛郎白先生」、或是稱羅拔泰勒爲「白蓓蘭史丹妃先生」、理由很簡單、因爲這兩對還沒有結過婚、</p>
<p>這種稱呼法對於做丈夫的男星實在是一種極大的侮辱、可是好萊塢人不管這些禮貌、有時候、做丈夫的只有比妻子在銀幕上的地位更高、薪水更大、然而只要他一跟女明星結婚、正和普通「某某夫人』的稱呼相反、他就是變成「某某先生」了、而目是以後、自然而然的他的地位慢慢的低落、同時他妻子的地位漸漸升高來、無論他婚前是怎樣一位光耀的大影星、婚後往往被他妻子的光輝所罩、趨於湮沒無聞、</p>
<p>或者、這就是使克拉克蓋勃爾和卡洛朗白、羅拔泰勒和白蓓蘭史丹妃這兩對遲　未敢結婚的原因——雖則幷不是完全爲此、至少也是主要原因之一——而往往、女星方面、因爲　對方過甚、也不願他走入這條沒落的途徑、如卡洛　白、她就不願眼看蓋勃爾受到她前夫威廉鮑愚爾所遭受過的影響、而白蓓蘭史丹妃也禾見願意讓羅拔泰勒步佛蘭克費的後塵</p>
<p>過去、這兩位女星都曾經努力的幫助丈夫們使在銀幕上的地位不致低落、可是不行、佛蘭克費跨出了影圈、威廉鮑惠爾呢、也一直　鬱不得　、直至他的名片『大偵探攝克』（The　ThfnMan）出現、</p>
<p>再看現在甜蜜的婚姻生活中的影星們、瓊白郎黛兒和狄克飽惠爾就是最好的一個例子、不錯、他們的生活是幸福的、可是狄克鮑惠爾的銀幕聲譽就此停止不進、反之、瓊白郞黛兒以做母親、的身份、竟是一日千里的飛躍着、未結婚前、狄克的地位遠在瓊之前、而現在、他們倆的賣座力、幾乎是並駕齊驅了、這是什麽緣故、好萊塢的婚姻竟有如此特殊的影響麽、</p>
<p>大凡一偭男星和一個女星結婚後、很明顯的、他是處於配角的地位了、被別人用譏笑的口吻呼之爲「某某先生」倒不是十分嚴重的事、更直接影響他影業生活的、却是他原有的影迷會被這次婚禮分了一大半到他夫人那邊去、</p>
<p>車情是這樣、他有一大羣的觀衆不是、結婚的消息一經俾出、他的影迷們鄱會去看他新婚夫人的下一張新片子、這純粹是一種好奇心、要看看這位和「他們的明星」結婚的是怎樣一個女子、這樣一來、至少這部份人暫時的就是他夫人的影迷了、女影迷看她的片子、是要想知道怎樣一個漂亮女子能贏得這位男星的心去、而男影迷想他別人不揀、揀中了她做妻子、她一定是位了不得的女子、這兩種心理、構成了於女星方面有利的主要因素、</p>
<p>影片公司也發現這位女星賣座力突然大佳起來、一—雖則有時祗是暫時、在婚後兩三張片子內有効——、於是訂合同、加薪水、替她選好導演、選擇更好的故事以作她下一張片子的劇本、而她却眞正紅起來了、</p>
<p>同時兩位影星結婚後、僅僅爲了她是女子、宣傳工作十分之九是偏重在她身上、尤其是那兒登在報紙上、雜誌上、玻窗內、影院前的她的相片、使她的容貌體態、在觀衆的腦子裏、留下一個比　那位不幸的男星更深的印象、</p>
<p>丈夫可倒了霉、演片機會也不能如以前那們多了、宣傳方面也居於劣勢的地位、尤其壤的是那些熟悉觀衆心理的雜誌編緝、當雜誌上有用到這位男星的照片時、他往往以他的妻子的照片代替、「用他妻子的照片罷、他的影迷也比較喜歡看她的照片呢、」完了、這位男星就永無露面之日、</p>
<p>只有那些在公共塲所兩人合照的相片才可以被印在報紙上、至少編輯人還不好意思把他—這個累贅物—剪了去、可是那種照片上、他祗楚縮在後面的一個活動佈景、光線黯淡、難看之極、對於影片賣座、實在有很犬的影響、有時候、由於妻子的帮助、他們並排立着面對攝影人、然而攝影者少少變換位置、穿着淺色衣服的女星比較近閃光燈泡二尺、僅僅二尺、就有了很大的差異、照片印出來了、女星的臉是容光煥發、而他呢、一副晦氣色面孔、久病初愈似的、在黑暗中若隱若現、自然囉、女星是常拍宣傳照片的、髮型衣飾相片之類、她們也常敎導觀衆如何化粧、如何表現美態、這些都更能吸引女性觀衆的注意、至於男星、有誰去注意他們的禮服或領結呢、</p>
<p>够了、不再講理由、由過去好萊塢歷史上看來、也許有多足資証明、小范朋克和瓊克勞馥結婚時、他正是一個初露頭角的明星、結過婚、他的事業停頓了、留在家裏、畫着圖書、接着離了婚、他到英國重新樹立起聲舉來、再回好萊塢繼續他的事業、其時瓊克馥已和法蘭却通結了婚、新丈夫聲　之低落使他不得不轉向舞台方面去、</p>
<p>更好的例子是重囘銀幕的劉易里斯、當他和羅拉蘭結婚時、他眞是個一等大紅星、然而此後我們便沒有聽見他的名字、與羅拉蘭　媽後、他曾有過一張足以挽囘聲譽的好片子、不幸他犯了一個大錯誤、又和琴逑羅吉斯結合了、又重演那一套、聲舉低落、再離婚、離婚後的他現在又步上成功之路、</p>
<p>其他、克勞黛考爾白和瑙門福斯脫、愛麗絲費和湯尼馬丁、珍尼麥唐納和琪恩雷山、都逃不出這個公式、只有安秀蘭和約翰潘恩一對是例外、十不得一的例外、</p>
<p>克拉克蓋勃爾怕快要做『卡洛朗白』先生了、但顧他逃出這個公式、我們實在不願少掉這樣一個好演員、</p>
<h3>銀花</h3>
<p>— 祥</p>
<p>露意絲蘭納、這次雖得不到藝術學院的演技獎、然而她已經獲得明星中本年乘坐飛機次數最多的榮譽了、去年一年中、她往退紐約和好萊塢兩地共有四十次、破從來未有的紀錄、最有趣的一次、她深夜裏忽然心血來潮、非第二天趕到紐約去不可、勿匆的祗穿着寢衣、外罩一件貂裘、就上了飛機、最後一次去紐約、是爲和她的丈夫編劇家克烈福奧進行和解的、希望她達到此行目的、</p>
<p>華爾脫溫吉爾、在報紙上說琪恩雷鬥和珍尼麥唐納有點不穩的形勢、然而照現在的情形看來、似乎還不至於、因爲他們仍　續合用一個宣傳員呢、依照好萊塢的慣例、一對夫婦要分手的話、未請敎律師之前就要各人另用一個宣傳員作宣傳上的對抗舉動了、</p>
<p>琪恩確是常常獨自出外觀拳鬥、間或獨自赴宴、然而這都是「丈夫常態」、不足爲怪、可是話又該說回來了、假使他們之間當眞有了裂痕、我們是不會知道的、</p>

<h3>東江×情的剖視</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>×人重犯東江、再攻惠博、在可能上說、誠有可能、但　在認爲×人已開始了向東江　擾、這個觀察未免屬於冒昧和單簡、</p>
<p>從外貌看來、這半個月來×人在東汀的行動、確似劍拔弩張、風來雨至的形勢、像博羅屬龍華、畏寧的騷擾、增城屬派澤的昭襲、惠莞邊區樟木頭的竄淮、和增城、石龍×兵的增加調動、緊張的狀態、已如箭在弦上、一觸卽發、再加以×機鎭天的威脅、今天　博羅、明天炸平三、後大炸惠陽、而大亞灣外的　艦　往來游戈、此去彼因、於是更升高了緊張的熱度、於是港澳間遂爭傳着×人如何動員、如何作戰了、其實這完全是×入以虛作實的奸猾手段、</p>
<p>依據日前具體事實觀察、×人對於東江、絕無　犯的企圖、這個企圖的放棄、正如記者在前一篇的通訊所說、是「力的不逮」、而非「心的所甘」、×人在東江一綫兵力的薄弱、九月來已發生了許多的訓明、在最近得來的情報、增城一僅四百名、石龍　百餘名、東莞僅三百名　石灣較多、約近千名、自不足爲患、可是×人爲了兵力的薄弱、內心正起恐慌、驚懼我軍的襲擊、不得不故弄玄虛、佈置疑陣、力求掩飾、第一以守爲攻、從增城石龍分道出擊、增、惠、博、東、寶各縣、但事後調杳、騷擾樟木頭的兵即騷擾龍華、長寧的兵、是同番號的部隊、把僅有的千餘人、暗中詭秘地調移到兩地使用、第二把應援　南島的兵取道石龍、東莞出海、籍以擴大東江的聲勢、阻止我軍的急進、第三利用空軍海軍向東江內地及沿海搗亂、吸引我軍的視終、鬆弛我方的攻勢、　四點尤其派大量間諜向東江活動、佈放荒謬消息、宣揚柔懷政策、所以東江各鄉村中、多不約而同盛傳着×軍東犯、和發現許多×人的宣傳品、爲主和的函件、怪異的傳單、雖則這種的宣傳品多爲×機夜間擲落、</p>
<p>可是×人　是詭秘掩飾、愈反映出兵力的薄弱、內心的驚惶、我們正乘着×人的弱點、開展着反攻的英勇恣態、連日來每天的夜間、都有×機一次次的飛往東江各地偵察我軍的調動、在反攻的前　、×人是何等的張惶無措、自顧尙月不暇、那還有餘力進犯、</p>
<p>我軍反攻的軍事、屬於秘密的自難述具詳、大致上可發表的惠塼寶東等縣仍劃爲游擊區域、主力的陣地戰將於龍門從化間展開、人民武力的自衛團和負游擊任務的正規隊伍、異常適當配合分佈於東江下游前線上的各根據地、</p>
<p>×人的野心、未始不欲沿東江再行推進、以阻正我軍的着着部署相進逼、似是我們估　着×人的淮犯路線與兵力、都非×人在現環境中所能解决、一、溯江而上、脆弱的汽艇固不能單獨作戰且東江現正涸淺、又加阻塞、　不能前進、二、從海道舊路、根本現在的惠海陸屬游擊區域、非我軍主力所在、無大採用的　要、三、沿廣九路出平湖深圳迂迴惠寶、路線太長、兵力過巨、目惠寶沿海這一片地域的得失、於我軍事上無重大的影嚮、四、沿惠廣道公路分犯惠、博、河源、無疑這一路爲×夙宿所夢想、假定姑能得手、然固守的兵力、最低估計、據點方面、惠州城內與外園須八百名、博羅五百名、河源二千名、交通綫方面、博增二千名、博河三千名、博惠七八百名、共約九千餘名、×人又在海南島陷落一個坭淖的今天、究從何處覓取　批兵力、大體上×人已放棄攻勢、保取守勢、今天正是×人苦慮焦思、束手無業的時候、</p>
<p>在×人苦悶的期間、或敢再來一次的冒險、集中輕騎向東江稍上作短期的出擾、但出援的區域、必定水道不敢越過鐵江、廣惠路不敢達到新作塘、惠樟路不敢越過樟木頭、海迫不敢登陸至二十里、因爲×人兵額分配枯絀、難獲後援、深忌我軍的埋伏園殲、</p>
<p>把×情整個的透視、我們可以明瞭染江的戰局、一、主動是在我們、只有我們攻×、×無力攻我、二、×人爲補救兵力單薄的弱點、必積極利用漢奸活動、輕騎「掃蕩」、機艦恐嚇的騷擾陰謀、和收買土匪、從中亂而已、</p>

<h3>教室遊戲體操教材（一）</h3>
<p>【本報特訊】同志們、春天來臨了、在這寸金寸土的香港、雨水霪霪的春日、就是給我們體育同志一個最大困厄的時期、在普通的學校、若有一個像角鬥檯一樣大小的場所、已經是榮幸至極、必說不上貴挨的雨操場（健身室）所以春雨連綿的時候、就無形中把我們體育同志的手上加了鎖一樣、（所謂英雄無用武之地）眞是令到我們無所施其技、尤其在內　來港的同志、更會感覺得是困難、因爲內地的環境根本與香港不同——內地有廣大的場所寬闊的校園及閱覽圖書、報張的地方、雖無雨操場、也最低限度有寬闊的禮堂、可以給體育課之利用、有這樣好的環境、無論體課或授課、也不致發生問題、但香港方面就、爲不然了、大多數的學校、都是人多地狹、不特沒有健身室的設備、且空餘的地方、及比較寬闊的圖書館等、也難找得着、因此每當雨天之時、必令到體育敎授、進退爾難、束手無策——欲授課、則無適當的塲所、休課嗎、不能、不能、休課時、必影嚮于學校的安寗、與妨害其他班級的授課、旣不能在操塲授課、又沒有健身室、更不能不授課、究竟怎樣的解决這個問題呢、　敎室去對學牛們呆坐嗎、或講故事呢、　故事、對于低年級的小學生遝可以行、但高年級的學生（初高中學生）呢、必成問題了、所以我們要根本的解　、唯有實行敎室遊戲體　、不過在實行這種體操時、亦有一個很大的問題、（卓越未完）</p>
<h3>明天黃花</h3>
<p>風雨送迎實有情</p>
<p>（特訊）前天下午、掃捍埔展開一個熱鬧塲面、乃南華南與東方作特別銀牌足球準决賽於此、當戰幕方揭時、細雨如總、旋卽晴止、到戰事將完時、又風雨驟至、炊許方睛、觀此、老大無情實有情、假如在比賽　行中下雨、便大煞風景了、</p>
<p>細數茱萸少一人</p>
<p>戰笳頻催、兩軍齊動、南南陣裏、細數茱萸少一人、蓋劉慶才足傷未愈、臨時不上火線、急煞莫軍師、幾經籌劃、才决定郭英祺打右前衛、這乃偶爾行權、却料不到英祺演出頭頭是道、莫軍師畢竟調動得宜</p>
<p>麥吊未卜心何欲</p>
<p>東方隊員登場時、靠北那邊的露天棚座裏陡起一片掌聲、南南球人上陣時、有蓋棚座裏也衝出一陣囘響、於此可見擁東擁南兩派乃各踞一方的、戰畢、　北那棚座　有一位看客、忽放鞭炮、不知是替南南祝捷還是吊東方喪　呢、</p>
<p>洋人一語刺心頭</p>
<p>余側、有一洋人借其太太同座、在上半時、兩角逐當中、常有侵人犯規的發現、累得裁判員奧馬先生頻頻嗚笛示罰、也虧他處置得宜、那洋人見此情景、忽喃喃自語道、『那裏是比賽、還是裁判員吹笛表演吧、』這話够幽默、直刺入我心頭、</p>
<p>障礙已除心未足</p>
<p>據捍埔場靠東那邊的露天棚座、近以球季將完、把以前豎起來障礙山上的普羅球遠的視線的竹物拆卸下去、所以、這天的普羅球迷、居高臨下、一目了然、將完賽時、有一位普羅球迷下山而欲攀入棚內『　油』。給巡塲的丘八看見、把他追逐起來、引起一陣嘩聲、</p>
<p>枝　　　　　運</p>
<p>劉頗漢與現任中華時報體、記者賴端甫『球塲舊侶一有爪葛親、賽畢、顯漢走到舊侶跟前、舊侶便說：「今天你們太不够運吧」、其實、舊侶此話不過聊以安慰顯漢而已、東方之敗、完全非敗於球運不濟、乃敗於技不如人、（破軍）</p>
<h3>腿部的重要</h3>
<p>— 王學政</p>
<p>劇重　腿部運動不僅能直接發達背　兩部的肌肉、對於腰、　兩部　內　也有莫大的裨益、尤其是循環和呼吸兩系統、他種運動雖然亦？使此兩系統的作用活躍、增進各部器官的官能、但其功效皆遠在劇重的腿部運動之下、</p>
<p>欲擴大胸部、使其發達至最完善的　　、也要行劇重的腿部運動、因爲這種運動能刺激肺部、使其吸收大量的空氣、</p>
<p>但是劇重的腿部運動並不適宜於患心臟病的人、身體健全的人行這種運動亦不可過於勉強、因這種運動對於心、肺兩部有很大的反應、須知不僅心、肺兩部、在何器官如工作過於劇烈、皆能蒙受重大的損害、</p>
<p>我們現在要討論的就是深膝蹲　運動、這個運動一方面是一種輕易的腿部運動、一方面也是一種劇重的腿部運動、換言之、一方面能促進代謝作用、使循環系統的作用活躍、一方面能使腿部肌肉織維長大、發達肌肉、　強腿部的耐力和能力、此外、對於發達背、腰、腹各部的肌肉也很有效、</p>
<p>「深膝蹲」運動的方法也很簡易、祗要身想儘量蹲下、然後直立、這个運動對於心、肺各能即有很大的反應、呼吸的方法也很重要、如呼吸錯誤、該兩部器官也能蒙受大的損害、呼吸的方法就是身體蹲下時呼、直立時吸、呼吸要深而慢、</p>
<p>舉行這種運動的時候、最重要的是由相而重、也要有一定的系統、我們可以按照下列程序做去、</p>
<p>（一）兩　平行、並向左右分開約八寸、然後身體儘量蹲下、至臂部與　腿　　而後直立、跟不可提起、共做十五次、　作要慢、做完之後、稍事休息、並行深呼吸約一分鐘、</p>
<p>（二）兩腳成八字形、男跟相書、先以　距儘　向上提起（吸）然後屈膝下蹲（呼）、至臀部與腳相　而後直立（吸）、身體直立後、　　下（呼）、共做　五次、這個運動也有益於　腿的肌肉、做完之後、亦行深呼吸約一分鐘、</p>
<p>（三）與（一）相同、但運動時、將與體重相等的　銓（Bas　dtll）或仙人担、沙袋、啞鈴等器械置於頸後肩上、或不用器械、而囑他人跨騎於肩上亦可、但其體重應與本人的體重接近、注意仍須保持腰直背平的姿勢、不可駝背、運動時如覺呼吸困難或心跳、可在身體直立時、稍停片刻、多呼吸兩三次、並可用口吸氣、共做十五至二十次、體力弱小或心臟不健全的人可將負在肩上的重量減至約爲體重的一半、次數也可以减至十或十五次、</p>
<p>運動完後行深呼吸約三分鐘、如尙有餘力、可重復再舉行一遍、但運動次數可減云五次、（二）</p>

<h3>〔真小人〕與〔偽君子〕</h3>
<p>— 張春風</p>
<p>讀書鏡卷八引楊用修語云：</p>
<p>「人君之愚暗柔弱，不足以亡其國，亡國者必剛愎明察之君也。擊之人家，不肖之子，不足以破家，其破家必輕俊無檢者也。在人臣則眞小人不足以亂國，其亂國者必僞君子也。」這是說『眞小人』比『僞君子』還可以原諒，其實這是從相對論的看法演繹而來的。</p>
<p>白樂天曾用一句詩來說明　者的輕重：『狐假女妖害猶淺，一朝一夕迷人眼；女爲狐媚害卽深，朝朝夕夕迷人心』，似乎狐假裝做女人來媚害惑人爲害不深。實則無論其爲狐女，抑爲女狐，都該一掃而光的。</p>
<p>大慨前人以爲眞小人之不足爲害全是由於衆目的明辨，以爲衆目所視，衆手所指，都在小心的提防着『小人』，小人當然不能肆其技，而只得隱形遁跡，掩了尾巴跑掉了，於是『眞小人』不足爲害的說法才成立。但有時也不是如此易行的，因爲旣是有資格做眞小人，說不定就會有眞小人的方法，掩住人的耳目，聲如說今日逃匿河內的汪兆銘，，就如東北的失陷後，汪高唱『團結一致，共赴國難』。其實國難並沒有赴。就又到了熱河失陷，平津震動，於是汪又唱『一面交涉，一面抵抗，』但也沒有抵抗，更沒有交涉，如果有的話，恐怕是秘密協定。末後又唱『流血到底主義』，和一與日偕亡一的謬說。當他在國家高上位裝腔做態，高呼抵抗，大叫「最後關頭」的時候。</p>
<p>今日抗戰的營陣裏。絲毫不容什麽「眞小人」或「僞君子」存在的，我們應該時常檢尋，聖經裏有去惡人如篩稗子的說法，今日的××××也該如此。甚麽是篩稗子的篩子呢？那就是四萬萬五千萬人的眼睛，思維和各人的兩雙手。</p>

<h3>洪秀全演義（民族小說話）</h3>
<p>— 鄭嘯</p>
<p>洪秀全演義二集二十九回，燕京大學藏有石印本，番禺黃小配撰。首內午（光緖三十二年）章炳麟序，又自序，題「黃帝紀元四千六百零六年」，可見此最初的二十九囘原作是宣統元年寫的，這時離武昌起義只有兩年。章炳麟又是提倡革命甚烈的，那末，此書的民族意識，不看也就知道是正確的了。記得民國肇建，我在蕪湖，那時只有十歲，看見街坊上盛行着一種三十六開狹長的油光紙的本子，假西裝，就是現今通　的平　，對面是綠色的薄紙，上端大書『洪秀全』三字，畫三個圓圈，印黑色，除字外，下面還有一張線條的圓畫。每本薄薄的二三十頁，好像至少有初二集。</p>
<p>但是，現在的通行本改稱「洪楊豪俠傳」，已經增至一百四十囘，把原書延長爲四倍了，我想，這後加的一百十一回，從第五十五囘起，該是遜淸遺老觔加的，如第七十八回囘目有「洪逆君臣全行斃命，曾家弟兄盡沐恩榮」，這是多末刺目的字眼—洪秀全則稱爲逆，曾國藩等則稱爲沐恩，眞可說是顚倒黑白。我讀過以後，覺得就是文字上，也是前五十四囘較好。如寫李秀成的戰術，極爲巧妙而有興趣。且有書卷氣，如第三十囘的「石達開詩退曾國藩」，卽用石達開的原信和原詩五首，這是可以與毛宗崗在一國演義上所加的名人詩句媲美的。阿英的　淸小說史云：「黃小配的洪秀全演義，惜乎傲到五十四回就中止了，且出版期已在淸社覆滅以後。」</p>
<p>這部小說仔細考證起來，不但篇幅不允許，我也沒有這樣的餘　和能力。大約簡又文和謝興堯是最能勝任的，因爲他們倆是太平天國研究的專家。簡又文著有「太平天國雜記」，謝興堯著有「太平天國史事論　」。此外的參考材料有李秀成的供狀，石達開的日記，太平天國詩文鈔，太平天國有趣文件（劉復編），太平夭國外紀，太平天國野史等等，眞是數都數不盡，至少可以消磨研究者好幾年的光陰。在創作方面，除了洪秀全演義以外，近人陳白　是以喜歡取材於此的，我曾介紹他去見過簡謝二專家，他的「金田村」一名「太平天國」曾經得到舞台上的成功，『石達關之死』似乎還不曾上演過，也許是爲了悲劇的氣分較重，不合於積極抗戰的現時代吧？電影和平劇也都用過太平天國的史事作爲題材。我希望將來能有詳細研討的機會。</p>
<h3>征途雜話</h3>
<p>— 胡危舟</p>
<p>在靑空飛唱著成零臘法的白鷺，部隊祗得在宿營地躭了一整天。咱們一千三百條好漢，過度的疲勞，有的一下子就在隨便那兒躺熟了。記得部隊剛到這裏是深夜三點鐘，隱約還聽得見遠處懶洋洋的山砲聲。我和老陳，在饑餓裏，喝着西風，情形顯得很個；大家　攤好一會兒，巴不得來個老百姓替我們找點食。正好，碰着一個當地的流氓，那自然，强盜在法官面前，準會裝出書生的模樣：他終是跟我們喀皮笑臉的怪客氣一同到了一間破屋子里，說是他底家，就呼喝一個婆子煮了飯，　了茶，自己遼去殺死一隻童子鴨，高與得甚麽似的東說說，西說說，硬向我們討去兩元大法幣。之後，咱們回到原處，和着衣，倒在石級上，算是泰然地睡去。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，我們繼續趕程，從牟腸小徑轉入了寬闊的公路；但砲整還是那們密集地圍繞住整个沉默的山　。</p>
<p>『何排長，聽見炮聲麽？……此刻假使你底太太在這兒，她一定會阻住你說：『去不得也……』』</p>
<p>『你媽的—書獃子—總是這麽一套，老子得搥你—』</p>
<p>「不？她昨兒不是在團部門口跟你鬥勁兒？」</p>
<p>『唔——一个軍人帶着太太在身邊，總不會有好事情……』</p>
<p>這麽着，上士文書算是滿意了，脚步里踏出勝利又高傲的調子。</p>
<p>部隊沿公路向東推進，將抵　和壚，忽地透來一陣混亂的聲音。我們知道的：這時村人們都在厭惡那夜色　黑了，不然，在他們這墟子底屋舍，村街，池塘和籬笆十，都能看得見滿天飛揚的塵沙。</p>
<p>脚步聲，轆　聲，婦孺的叱罵，以及馬蹄和馬底嘶鳴，無數的，緊張的喧囂，長長的喘息在公路底脉膊上。當然，遭續情優在這兒是從來有過，遵守壇的犬輩，　　奇地發出從未有過的狂吠。</p>
<p>聲音　　　響了，響得吞噬了這深秋之夜底全部寂靜。遺些趕路者底眼睛——不，是流囚們底火鳥珠，對場了我們當車的傢伙射出忿怒又狠惡的神色。</p>
<p>這是難民過境嗎？可是其間淸楚聽得出有着炮車和馬羣。這是行軍嗎？怎的會夾　着婦孺的哀號和罵咒？這是……這　是混亂，緊張，尖銳，　鬧，哭咒……驪合了寫蘊　　的聲，之激流，洪　：</p>
<p>哦！這聲音，是咱們抗戰軍隊在慌忙的淮行中，滲入了迎面而來的萬千個毫無頭緖的，連夢也不信自己底家鄕突會變成修羅場的難民，他們那種沒命的，逃難的亂離聲，這聲音充塞住恐怖，悲慘，戰慄的氣息，從那邊掠過來，又要掠到別處去—夜風吹過來×軍野炮的哀嗚，我們的隊伍劉越過一段斜坡與橋樑，又在平原上上奮勇地前進了。</p>

<p>『冷』與『熱』，這是兩個絕對相反的形容詞，通常究竟有着怎樣的標準，才算恰合乎它們字面上的身份呢？回答的是：『冷熱是比較中得到的標準。』</p>
<p>這里就可分別『冷』『熱』的路綫：熱情與冷酷，熱血與冷血，狂熱與冷靜，熱鬧與冷落。要是以『人生』來作譬喻，那末，大槪兒童時期是熱中於『游戲』而冷於『戀愛』，少年時代是熱中於『戀愛』而冷於『游戲』，中年時代是熱中於『名利』而冷於『戀愛』，老年時代是熱中於『安逸享福』而對游戲，戀愛，名利都冷淡了。</p>
<p>中國現在所需要的是懷着熱烈的情緖，捧着一顆赤紅的心血壯烈地流出了鮮紅炙熱的血，把一切獻給抗戰中的靑年。中國所不需要的是冷酷無情。「熱漲冷縮」，這是物理學的定律，但在中國却失去了它一半的作用。在中國每一個角落都燃起了抗戰的烽火的今日，後方民衆，儘管天氣是怎樣的嚴寒酷冷，他們對祖國盡忠的熱心，却是到了最高度。爲了×人砲火的摧燬而流離顚沛着的難胞們身十沒穿棉衣，被凜冽的朔風所侵襲，却反能把反抗的勢力鼓勱起來。</p>
<p>再譬如在前綫吧：在冰天雪地中浴血抗戰，任天氣是怎般的冷，但勇士們同仇敵愾英勇抗戰的一顆心中。正熱烘烘的沸騰着熱血。</p>
<p>每一個人都要『熱』，但過熱了有時會發『冷』。要是覺得身體熱起來時，熱得汗出如瀋；冷的時候冷得上下牙打顫，這『忽冷忽熱』『冷熱無常』，就可斷定你已患了『冷熱病』，須得急請大夫診察。服幾顆『金鷄納霜　』，把『瘧疾菌』驅逐出境才是。</p>
<p>同樣的，某種國家需要熱烈而又勇武的軍部，需要頭腦冷靜的政治家，彼此有着密切的連帶關係，否則，就失去了。『冷』『熱』的調劑與中和。如果熱起來，軍部就橫衝直撞；冷了，冷得勇士們都『厭戰』『上弔』，這樣的『忽熱忽冷』『冷熱無常』，就造成了國家的『冷熱病』。但　可不能請一假大夫診斷就可了事，須得由患『冷熱病』的國家的人民深深地覺到自己國家病入　肓，再不急起挽救，勢必同歸於盡，那末事應該聯合被軍閥壓迫下的大衆。擎起了反抗的大廳，把法西斯的瘧疾菌——軍閥消滅個精光。</p>

<h3>Japan's Attack on the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>Japan has recently been launching attacks on the United Kingdom and the United States using methods of monetary warfare.</p>
<p>Monetary warfare is the sharpest and most effective method of economic warfare. Therefore, for decades, the economic wars between the world's major powers have been concretely manifested in the struggle between currency blocs, such as the Sterling Bloc, the Franc Bloc, the Dollar Bloc, and even the Yen Bloc. This kind of monetary warfare has recently been reflected in the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese invaders initially thought that military force could solve everything, but as the scale of the war expanded, especially when carrying out economic plundering, they discovered the resilience of China's legal tender (fapi) and recognized the power of the fapi in the War of Resistance. Subsequently, although the puppet United Reserve Bank was established and counterfeit banknotes were issued, they were still expelled by the fapi, and the people refused to use them. Japan originally wanted to weaken China's strength in the War of Resistance by destroying our fapi system and disrupting our financial organization, but it did not know that after nineteen months of our War of Resistance, the foundation of the fapi has become more consolidated. As Japanese economists generally say, if Japan cannot shake the foundation of China's fapi, it will be extremely difficult to force China to surrender.</p>
<p>The consolidation of the foundation of China's fapi is partly due to the abundance of hard currency reserves, but the important reason is the consistent and unwavering support of the United Kingdom and the United States. Japan's occupation of Guangzhou was for military purposes, but its intention to disrupt the economic ties between China and the United Kingdom in order to shake the foundation of China's fapi is very obvious. However, Guangzhou has been occupied for half a year, and the United Kingdom is still lending huge sums of money, directly and indirectly, to support our country's fapi. On the 7th, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon publicly announced that "the United Kingdom has decided to invest 10 million pounds to maintain the price of China's fapi as a basic fund for stabilizing currency prices" and established a new loan agreement. After this news came out, newspapers in Tokyo were greatly disturbed and criticized it heavily. The Hochi Shimbun even said: "The Japanese government should immediately lodge a strong protest against this unfriendly action by the United Kingdom, and at the same time, it should take active counter-measures against the new Sino-British agreement and retaliate against British interests in China." The Japanese cabinet also held an emergency meeting to discuss its attitude towards the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a Reuters dispatch from Peiping reported: "The puppet government of North China has decided to ban the use of Chinese fapi from March 11, and will designate North China as a United Reserve Area... People in the area who dare to use Chinese fapi will be fined and their property confiscated." An Associated Press dispatch further reported: "The Japanese army has decided to implement foreign exchange controls in various parts of North China starting today." And promulgated new control regulations, forcing people to use banknotes from the "United Reserve Bank." This clearly shows that Japan has used force to incorporate various parts of North China into the so-called "Yen Currency Bloc," and the economic impact on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will be very great. After the implementation of this policy by Japan, the United States will lose 60 million yuan in trade with China each year, and the losses suffered by the United Kingdom will be no less than this amount. This policy of Japan can be regarded as an economic retaliation taken by Japan against the United Kingdom and the United States. The implementation of this policy by Japan is not only a fatal blow to foreign businessmen in China, but also a great blow to British and American banks specializing in foreign exchange, especially HSBC.</p>
<p>Japan's monetary warfare attack is certainly directly attacking China, but in essence, the countries most harmed are the United Kingdom and the United States. Only by the United Kingdom and the United States retaliating against Japan as soon as possible and imposing economic sanctions can they stop the rampant behavior of the crazy aggressors. The economic sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States on Japan have not yet escaped the stage of empty talk, and at best are only indirect and partial measures. The United Kingdom has long been clamoring to revoke the rights enjoyed by Japan under the most-favored-nation clause, restrict the import of Japanese goods into the United Kingdom, or even completely ban them, but there is still no follow-up. Japan has now implemented an economic dogfight against the United Kingdom and the United States in North China. If its scope of implementation is expanded to the occupied areas of Central China and South China, the economic bases of the United Kingdom and the United States in China will be completely lost. If this conspiracy of Japan is tolerated by the United Kingdom and the United States, it can win without resorting to arms against the United Kingdom and the United States, and control the lifeline of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. At this time, the United Kingdom and the United States should have full consideration and active countermeasures. The Shanghai Da Mei Bao has analyzed the importance of the relationship in its commentary: "If all countries are willing to tolerate the exclusion by the aggressors or the puppet governments instructed by the aggressors, the trade of all countries in China will fall into a dead end. Under this kind of treatment that violates treaties and violates the principles of fairness, few foreign businessmen can survive." The newspaper also strongly urged all countries to impose effective sanctions on Japan in a timely manner: "Will Western countries tolerate the complete loss of their interests in China and only make protests that are of no help? Or will they take strong and effective steps to give their domestic merchants a chance to fight? Which way to go, now is the time!"</p>
<h3>Interview with General Li Zongren</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>I have long admired the outstanding figure of this era – General Li Zongren, the commander of the Fifth War Area, who advocated a scorched-earth resistance even before the July 7th Incident, and who has been able to stand alone since the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Especially coming from the southwestern frontier of the War of Resistance – Western Province – where national defense construction has made rapid progress, the military and civilians are united as one, and waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. The so-called seeing its objects and thinking of its people, I was eager to see the demeanor of General Li, who is in a leading position in everything in Guangxi, and listen to his insightful opinions, so as to tell the readers everything. Naturally, this has become an important mission for me on this trip to a certain place.</p>
<p>I had seen several photos of General Li beforehand, and from his farsighted gaze and his awe-inspiring attitude, I suspected that he was not an easy person to approach and talk to. However, now, under the guidance of Shi Hualong, the director of the adjutant office of the Commander-in-Chief of the District, I was able to meet General Li in a medium-sized, leaky corner building in ××, and had a pleasant and frank conversation with him for more than an hour. He had a ruddy complexion, a kind and amiable attitude, but his speech was powerful and insightful, like that of a scholar. This increased my respect and admiration for him, and I privately congratulated him on the bright future of the War of Resistance in this area!</p>
<p>On that day, as soon as our happy and enjoyable conversation turned to the topic of the War of Resistance, the first chapter of the opening remarks, General Li said solemnly and righteously:</p>
<p>"We soldiers take obedience to orders as our duty!" The tone was abrupt, a bit like a peak flying from the sky, but the attitude was somewhat respectful, as if reading the will of the Prime Minister: "China has the wise and decisive leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians of the whole country can unite and protect Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance to the end. We must clearly recognize that this is a major guarantee for China's inevitable final victory in the War of Resistance!" This statement has the flavor of Mr. Li Qiuquan's self-narration: "I looked down on Mr. Chiang before the War of Resistance, but after the War of Resistance, I kowtowed to Mr. Chiang." But now, the quick words coming from General Li, who has been leading hundreds of thousands of troops in the War of Resistance for twenty months, are naturally much more great and practical than the former.</p>
<p>"Conversely!" he said heavily again: "Since the war situation has entered a new stage, the Japanese army, deeply mired in the quagmire, encounters difficulties in every way it advances; behind it, guerrillas are actively operating; and bombs are buried everywhere in its own country; the international situation is becoming increasingly disharmonious with it – unless Japan immediately abandons its aggression; otherwise, failure will be inconceivable!" After talking about the general outline in such a way, he then analyzed each item in detail:</p>
<p>"Of course, the Japanese will fight like trapped beasts, and will still launch local offensives against us in the future, and will boast about so-called 'suppressing guerrillas,' and try to extend their reach beyond 'points' and 'lines,' which is objectively impossible. In every occupied area, there are hundreds and thousands of awakened young people who are willing to stay there to do political resistance work, and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of regular troops and guerrillas who are cooperating there to do military resistance work. Our new forces are constantly growing and the momentum is increasing. The Japanese army cannot even protect the 'points' and 'lines' it has already occupied, so how can it have the extra strength to talk about 'suppression'? The Japanese army is not afraid of expanding the war zone and launching local offensives against us again, but it will still have no results and only increase its own difficulties.</p>
<p>"Japan is a small country in a state of raw material famine. It feels a lack of cotton, fur, food, and other industrial raw materials. In particular, oil and iron are no different from the blood and backbone of the god of war, but Japan mostly purchases them from abroad. Pre-war savings are limited. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we crushed its strategy of 'quick victory,' and it was already stretched thin. In the current second phase of the War of Resistance, the situation is expanding day by day. The Japanese not only need more resources, but also need to increase their troop strength even more. The thirty-odd divisions currently in China are badly battered. Because conscription is a problem (conscription has exceeded fifteen terms, and even fifteen- and sixteen-year-old children are being drafted), finance is a problem, and even sleeves feel difficult to fill. Where can they find a large new army to increase their numbers? But in fact, they have no choice but to squeeze their own people, which will arouse the rise of anti-war sentiments and the expansion of anti-war actions.</p>
<p>"The international situation is unfavorable to Japan. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States are granting loans to China. When Wuhan was abandoned, Japan announced to the international community that it did not recognize the Republic of China government; but the United Kingdom and the United States insisted on granting large loans to China, meaning they were telling Japan: 'You don't recognize it, but we do, and we will use our strength to help China.' And in the past, Japan could buy goods from the United Kingdom and the United States on credit, but now it 'shouldn't even think about it.' Because Japan is now trying to play the trick of 'using Chinese resources to dominate the Far East and conquer the world,' it has just come out of the gate and has already made people's heads ache. For the sake of their own interests, the United Kingdom and the United States will not sell their military supplies to Japan even if it has cash. Its unfortunate brothers, Germany and Italy, are truly birds of a feather, and are similarly consuming themselves in aggression, and will not be able to take care of themselves in an emergency.</p>
<p>"The military strength of the Anglo-American-French-Soviet peace front is increasing day by day, while the military strength of the Japanese-German-Italian aggression front is decreasing day by day. When the day comes when we must fight head-on, the Japanese-German-Italian wolves in cahoots, who are endangering world peace, will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the defeat in the First World War.</p>
<p>"Japan is in a situation of being scorched inside and out, and riding a tiger that it cannot dismount. It has probably foreseen its future terrible fate, so there are constant cabinet crises within the country. Members of parliament dare to openly question the government, saying that 'Konoe has lost the hearts of the people,' that 'Hiranuma has no concrete policies to win the support of the whole country,' and even scolding that 'the Hiranuma cabinet is the most unpopular cabinet in history.' This shows that Hiranuma, who has only been in power for a short time, has run into walls everywhere and has not accomplished anything, and has already aroused great resentment. At the same time, the fact that Japanese members of parliament are so opposed to the government is also a sign that the Japanese military government is about to collapse. Will there be another reorganization? But no matter how many times it is reorganized, the internal contradictions will still not be resolved."</p>
<p>General Li talked eloquently to this point, then suddenly pondered for a moment; then seeing that the charcoal fire in the basin was about to go out, he went to hold the tongs and added charcoal, and the three gold stars on his yellow collar badge shone brightly in the firelight. This reminded me of the time when he gave a lecture at the Guangxi Military Academy on his struggle history, saying that he used to be a peasant family who half-farmed and half-studied, and he had done all the farming work, chopping firewood, cutting grass, and even cleaning the cattle pen. His great spirit of hard work and practical work, which is consistent in poverty and success, and which is constantly being promoted and carried forward, is truly enough to enlighten and exemplify revolutionary soldiers and young people of the era.</p>
<p>"Japan is not without ways to save itself," he said, returning to his seat and resuming his previous topic: "The one who tied the bell must untie it. Japan should repent, automatically withdraw its troops, and return Chinese territory. Then the deep-seated hatred of generations will be resolved in one stroke. This is not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for Japan." These words, when heard by the Japanese fascist warlords, must be like playing the lute to a cow, so he continued to say:</p>
<p>"This is just our objective way of thinking for Japan, of course, Japan will absolutely not do this. The Japanese warlords want to act recklessly. The result of acting recklessly will either be the defeat of the war of aggression, or the Japanese people, who can no longer tolerate it, will unite and carry out a revolution to overthrow their warlords. But at this time, Japan will be in a state of collapse, and the suffering will be even greater. The peace-loving Japanese people, 'if they are hungry, they will seek food,' will have to ask us for help to re-establish the foundation of their social stability."</p>
<p>Regarding the period of the great defeat of the Japanese war of aggression, the general estimated: "The maximum is no more than two years." He further said: "If Japan's finances can support it to fight for another year and a half, it will be remarkable – as for our external assessment of the enemy and internal examination of the national situation, having determined a long-term War of Resistance, we can continue the war for five or ten years... This has practical potential strength and objective inevitable conditions."</p>
<p>Afterwards, from improving the weaknesses of the early War of Resistance, he talked about the issue of domestic political adjustment: He said: By using the raging flames ignited by the War of Resistance, the white-hot boiling blood, to sweep away all internal corruption and decay, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Talking about the Wang Jingwei issue, he said that Wang abandoned his status as a meritorious official of national revival and went to make peace with the enemy, resulting in his ruin and eternal damnation. Finally, he even talked about the Miao and Yao people in Guangxi, saying that the Miao and Yao people in Guangxi have modern firearms, which he advocated giving them in the past. At that time, some people opposed it, fearing that they would rebel if they got guns. In fact, not giving them guns and preventing them from rebelling is like 'attacking the city as the inferior strategy,' and giving them guns and making them truly united with us is the good strategy of 'attacking the heart as the superior strategy.' As expected, now they are being used to contribute to the entire country and nation! In short, every time he talks about an issue, he has his own unique insights, which flow from his gentle mouth, and cannot help but make you sincerely convinced.</p>
<p>The day after the enjoyable conversation and farewell, I also received a page of calligraphy from General Li for this newspaper through Mr. Wei Yongcheng, the director of the political department, encouraging the people to resist to the end (see illustration): and a victory memorial photo from Taierzhuang, showing the General still looking awe-inspiringly and vigilantly at the bright victory ahead!</p>
<h3>The Increasingly Serious Grain Problem in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Liang Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the grain panic in Guangdong has reached an exceptionally severe level: In the worst-affected areas, such as the Chao-Shan and Sze Yup regions, and areas near occupied zones, one yuan can only buy about four catties of white rice. Averaging across the province, rice prices are twice as expensive as they were at the same time last year. This poses a severe threat especially to the lower and middle classes: urban artisans and the poor, who in the past could earn enough to fill their bellies each day through labor, now must tighten their belts and eat less; poor farmers in rural areas, who in the past sold their hard-earned grain at low prices to repay debts when new grain was harvested, now must buy back rice piecemeal at prices several times higher to stave off hunger. Laboring compatriots throughout the province are teetering on the brink of starvation. We hear their cries of pain from every corner of the province (In recent days, people in Sze Yup, Zhongshan, and other places have sent telegrams to the administrative commissioner of the region, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, and the national and provincial governments, appealing for help.) This is a serious problem for Guangdong in the second stage of the war of resistance. If this problem is not properly resolved, it will greatly hinder the stability of the front and rear, and mass war mobilization. Fortunately, our wise local officials in Guangdong have attached great importance to this problem and have determined a correct policy. A quick dispatch from Shaoguan, published in a Hong Kong newspaper on February 28th, stated: Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth War Zone, and Li Hanshun, chairman of Guangdong Province, now consider that the exhaustion of grain in Guangdong and the daily rise in rice prices must be urgently addressed to support the war of resistance and maintain the people's livelihood. To address both the symptoms and the root causes, in addition to actively communicating with Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi provinces to secure grain sources for immediate relief, they have also issued orders to the magistrates of various counties, strictly urging township heads in grain-producing areas to instruct villagers to reclaim wasteland and expand this year's spring plowing. The planting of non-grain-related crops will be restricted. The Provincial Bank also plans to allocate 10 million yuan to provide spring plowing loans, striving to increase grain production and fundamentally resolve the grain crisis in Guangdong. In addition to agreeing with and supporting this correct measure, we wish to deeply examine this problem and propose some concrete solutions to contribute to our wise local officials and all compatriots in the province:</p>
<p>The shortage of grain in Guangdong did not begin today, especially in Chao-Shan and Sze Yup. Every year during March and April, when stored grain is almost depleted and new grain has not yet come to market, rice prices rise sharply. Many men going to Nanyang to seek a living, weakening the agricultural productivity of the villages, is an objective reason. However, this is not an irremediable weakness. Countless tracts of land lie barren, uncultivated. In eastern Guangdong, fields of millet have replaced rice and wheat growing on fertile land. Grain production still follows centuries-old methods, with no change whatsoever. A vast labor force is not being utilized, and batches of villagers are flowing into the cities. Humanity, bound by unreasonable production, social, and political organizations, demonstrates its inability to conquer nature here. These unreasonable organizations not only directly constrain agricultural productivity but also cause various abnormal phenomena in the grain circulation process. Landlords in rural areas and unscrupulous merchants in cities buy grain from farmers at low prices when new grain comes to market, then hoard it and sell it at high prices when grain is scarce. Some places with abundant grain production are prohibited from exporting grain under the pretext of storing grain, forcing farmers to sell at painfully low prices, from which a few profit. These are the main reasons for the grain panic in Guangdong.</p>
<p>After the July 7th Incident, these weaknesses were not overcome. Although the central government's financial and economic policies have seen many new improvements since the war of resistance, these malpractices have remained unchanged in Guangdong. On the contrary, due to the invasion of Guangdong by Japanese troops, the occupation of Guangzhou and surrounding areas, the flight of people near the war zones, and the intensification of the economic offensive by Japanese people in the East River area, grain production in the Pearl River Delta and nearby areas has been completely ruined. Japanese people are buying large quantities of grain in Zhongshan and other coastal counties to supply their invading navy and transport it inland to manipulate rice prices. The destruction of roads and the occupation of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway have further increased the difficulty of transporting grain from Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi into Guangdong and the circulation of grain within Guangdong. The severance of Guangdong's international transport lines and the even more severe blockade in the future will also prevent the import of foreign rice into Guangdong. This has made the rice shortage in Guangdong even more severe. The unprecedented rise in rice prices in Guangdong Province at present is a concrete reflection of the development of these factors.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that to truly solve this problem, both "addressing the symptoms and the root causes" is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>First, there should be appropriate regulation of grain distribution. Each county and township throughout the province should immediately conduct a survey of the types, quantities, and required levels of stored grain. The government or community-organized cooperatives should purchase surplus grain from each county and township at a fixed price, conduct price stabilization measures, and take unified allocation. Private hoarding of grain, manipulation of market prices, and the smuggling of grain to aid the enemy by traitors must be strictly prevented. In areas such as the West River region, according to what we know: Guangning, Yangchun, Enping, and Zhongshan all produce abundant rice. In addition to supplying the needs of their own counties, they can also export to relieve neighboring counties. Each county and township should not have local perspectives but should prioritize the nation and the country, and take care of the overall situation. In addition, the authorities should also try to use all possible means of transportation to transport large quantities of rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi into Guangdong, and temporarily reduce taxes on foreign rice to supplement the shortage of domestic rice. In order to effectively implement the above work, each county should convene local fair merchants and representatives of community organizations to discuss specific implementation measures, and establish organizations such as grain relief committees to be responsible for carrying out this work. The heads of these implementing agencies must be honest and fair and fully implement the opinions of the people. It is hoped that the administrative commissioners of all regions of the province—especially the regions of Sze Yup and Chao-Shan—will also convene meetings of the administrative heads of each county to discuss unified relief measures.</p>
<p>At the same time, all localities should call for widespread grain conservation movements, such as not making rice cakes during the New Year festival, reducing wine steaming, raising fewer domestic fowl, and promoting the consumption of miscellaneous grains. Through the political mobilization of the masses, organized masses from existing community organizations should take a model role, and extend this movement to the masses of all levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, production must be greatly increased. Currently, the main task is to call for and launch a widespread spring plowing campaign. First, a large amount of existing wasteland must be reclaimed—especially in areas farther from the front lines. All available manpower must be mobilized, such as large numbers of refugees, the unemployed, and rural women. First, community organizations must mobilize their already organized masses and organize countless reclamation teams to unite the unorganized masses to carry out this work. Wasteland belonging to the public should be allocated to the masses for cultivation by the government. Wasteland belonging to landlords should be borrowed by the government for their use. Families of soldiers fighting the war of resistance should be helped by everyone with free cultivation. The government should designate damaged roads for landowners to divide into sections for plowing and application. Local defense forces and self-defense teams should also participate in this work as much as possible in their spare time. Second, the planting of unnecessary agricultural products and even harmful crops, such as poppies, should be reduced, and replaced with rice and wheat. In the current situation, the planting of miscellaneous grains that can be harvested in a shorter period should be increased to meet urgent needs. Third, seeds, production methods, and production tools should be improved to obtain greater harvests on the same cultivated land. It is hoped that the provincial government will convene agricultural experts and a large number of technicians to assist in this work. Local farmers' organizations should provide more opinions to the government, such as building water conservancy projects, purchasing new agricultural tools and seeds, and organizing production cooperatives. In order to ensure the progress of these tasks and to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production, the government must improve farmers' lives as much as possible and help them solve specific difficulties, such as appropriately reducing rent and interest, extending the land lease period for tenant farmers by landlords, providing farmers with seeds, farm tools, land, and fertilizers without requiring property or gentry guarantees, banning high-interest loans in rural areas, establishing rural financial circulation institutions by the government, providing loans to farmers with no or very low interest, establishing free schools and night schools, and providing free education to their poor children. Second, farmers must be organized on a broad scale, including organizations for production, organizations for consumption, organizations for self-defense, and organizations for cultural education. Only under a more rigorous organization can they be helped to produce more diligently and effectively. The best form of organization is organizations like mutual aid societies. Under these organizations, reclamation teams, field and forest protection teams, guard teams, literacy groups, salvation rooms, field affairs research groups, guerrilla groups, etc. can be established. These organizations can not only help mobilize farmers to work hard in production, but also immediately become organizations for mobilizing farmers to participate in guerrilla warfare and assist government regular troops in resisting Japanese troops when war comes.</p>
<p>We must fully recognize the seriousness of the current grain problem in Guangdong. Although our local government has vigilantly taken note of this problem and has a correct solution, and these solutions are beginning to be implemented, the solution to this problem will not achieve the desired results if it relies solely on the government without the cooperation of the people. All community organizations throughout the province should immediately mobilize, support the government's basic policy for solving the grain problem, help the government regulate grain, and organize countless reclamation teams, substitute farming teams, and production teams to go to the 'front line' of production, launch a full-scale spring plowing campaign throughout the province, and, in this movement, organize millions of Guangdong farmers into the ranks of the war of resistance, preparing to launch a province-wide guerrilla war in the near future, and strike at the enemy's continued advance into Guangdong!</p>
<h3>China's Way of Resisting Aggression and Seeking Peace Two Thousand Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Zeng Qi</p>
<p>"The Chinese nation is known to the world for its love of peace and opposition to aggression, and it has earned the reputation of a peaceful nation for good reason." Historically, China has never invaded any small or weak nation. Ideologically, Chinese Confucianism, Taoism, Mohism, Legalism, and even militarism all take peace as their guide, and no one has ever praised war. Tracing back to the seventh century BC, during the decline of the Zhou Dynasty in the feudal era, various kingdoms were divided and fought against each other. The people's emotions of anti-war and praying for peace were extremely strong. Therefore, the following peace methods were developed:</p>
<p>(1) Guan Zhong's Peace Method: In 685 BC, Duke Huan of Qi obtained the great statesman Guan Zhong as his prime minister. Guan Zhong advocated maintaining armed peace with Qi as the center. All problems should be resolved by convening international conferences. He successively convened a total of nine conferences, all with Qi as the leader. He achieved hegemony without bloodshed. Confucius called Guan Zhong "uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world." This can be called the peace method of a hegemon.</p>
<p>(2) Mozi's Peace Method: The philosopher Mozi wrote "Against Aggression," becoming a famous anti-aggression advocate. Although Mozi fundamentally opposed war, he advocated studying self-defense methods. At that time, Gongshuban was advocating war and building cloud ladders for Chu to attack the city of Song. Mozi then went to Song to help defend it. As a result, Gongshuban attacked nine times without success, and Song was able to survive. This can be called the peace method of self-defense.</p>
<p>(3) Song Keng's Peace Method: In the 3rd century BC, Song Keng, who lived at the same time as Mencius, witnessed the disturbances of international warfare and endless conquests, and persuaded the feudal lords, strongly arguing for the injustice of war. He persuaded them to stop fighting and maintain peace. This can be called the peace method of persuasion.</p>
<p>(4) Xiang Xu's Peace Method: During the Spring and Autumn Period, Xiang Xu of Song, seeing that wars between countries caused disasters and suffering to the people, initiated a disarmament conference, calling for peace. Jin Gui said to Xuan Yuhe: "War is the destruction of the people, the burden on wealth, and a major disaster for small countries." They initiated together and jointly planned to implement it. Its nature is similar to today's international disarmament conference, and it can also be called "abolition of military armaments." This can be called the peace method of disarmament.</p>
<p>Of the above four, I believe Mozi's peace method is the most reasonable and effective. Mozi practiced what he preached, helping Song defend itself, and the aggressor Gongshuban could do nothing about it. Mozi's "Against Aggression" says: "When a great state attacks a small state, other states should help defend it; if the walls of the small state are not complete, they must be made to repair them; if the supply of grain is cut off, then provide it; if money and silk are not enough, then share them." His words on the indivisibility of peace are almost in line with US President Roosevelt's "Indivisible Peace Theory," reflecting each other from ancient and modern times, as if they were in agreement. Therefore, he advocated that when a strong country invades a weak country, countries that love peace must rise up together to intervene. At the same time, the weak country must strengthen its defenses. If food is insufficient, provide it with resources; if finances are insufficient, provide it with capital. If this can be done, the aggressor will know that his plan cannot succeed, and will naturally withdraw. This kind of self-defensive, inclusive, and helpful peace method is most beneficial to world peace. I hope that the comrades of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference will dedicate this idea to peace-loving people all over the world, and work together to make aggressors disappear from the world, so that human civilization will advance indefinitely.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Xiangyang states that we are currently launching guerrilla warfare in various places in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, attacking the enemy. We have also damaged the railway in many places. The situation in eastern Henan is calm. The enemy has few troops in various places and has no intention of attacking recently.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Guilin states that there are no changes in the war situation in South China. Yesterday, the enemy shelled Meiaotou and the vicinity of Canghaiji from Xiamen. 300 to 400 enemy soldiers attempted to land near Haicheng on four boats but were repelled by us.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Xi'an states that the enemy invading Jingle numbers about 2,000. We have been reinforcing our forces and counterattacking for days. Fierce battles are taking place in Yonganzhen, Liulinzhen, and Ninghuazhen. In the battle of Dawuzhen in southern Shanxi, we lured the enemy to Yukouzhen and surrounded them on three sides, annihilating 600 to 700 enemy soldiers. A portion of the enemy attacked Shimen, but we intercepted them. Fierce battles are taking place between us and the enemy near Jiangxian and Yicheng in southern Shanxi, and in the vicinity of Dajiaozhen. The enemy has increased forces in Yucheng, attempting to invade west again, but we are waiting in strict formation.</p>
<p>[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] After our troops made a large-scale rear guard action in western Shanxi, they have been continuously searching and advancing for days, completely eliminating the remnants of the enemy at Jiaokou Hejiata, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers. Near Lijiawan, our troops seized six bunkers, eliminating most of the enemy guarding them. Lijiawan has been heavily besieged, and the enemy is very panicked. Fierce battles are still taking place near Jinjie Town. It is also reported that Zhongyang Yunbo has increased the enemy forces by 3,000 to 4,000, with 30 artillery pieces and more than 10 tanks. With the exception of 2,000 who attacked Dawu to the north, the rest are stationed in various strongholds in the middle, attempting to invade west. However, after this defeat, their plan has been largely broken by our troops.</p>
<p>[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] The conscripted soldiers trained by the enemy in Yangyu County have recently been greatly shaken in morale due to the shortage of food and the tight pressure from our troops. Fearing disturbances, the enemy has already disbanded hundreds of conscripts by imperial decree.</p>
<p>[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] It is also reported that the enemy at Jindui, northeast of Anze, was severely attacked by our forces. Unable to hold out, the enemy fled through Anji, disturbing Tangcheng Town east of Mapaoquan. We are currently tracking them down. Another force is intercepting them west of Tangcheng, surrounding them from both sides. The enemy is currently very panicked.</p>
<p>[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] Anti-war sentiment is very high among the soldiers in Fencheng. According to the enemy soldiers, when they were told to depart, the authorities told them that the conscription period was seven months, but now it has been a year and they cannot return. They believe this is because the families of soldiers in the country have made requests that the authorities cannot meet. Furthermore, two soldiers in Hongtong committed suicide due to war weariness the other day. Three others outside Zidonggu secretly changed into plain clothes and privately escaped on a train, but were caught. The lack of morale of the enemy army is evident from this.</p>
<h3>Our Three Regular Army Divisions Open the Beijing-Shanghai Line: Shangguan Yunxiang is Appointed Commander: Currently Actively Preparing for a Counterattack</h3>
<p>[Shanghai Dispatch] The guerrilla forces of our army on the Beijing-Shanghai Line have been adjusted and are in order. Three elite regular army divisions have been transferred from a certain place earlier this month, and Shangguan Yunxiang is in charge. A large-scale general counterattack will soon occur. The enemy forces are extremely panicked and are setting up defensive works along the Beijing-Shanghai Line day and night. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regular Army Transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>Regarding the military plans for each guerrilla area, the authorities have made overall plans and established a Guerrilla Headquarters. Chairman Chiang is concurrently the Director-General and has designated various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Shandong, to be divided into several districts. A branch office will be established in each district, with military and political officials. They have already been appointed, and each district is actively proceeding. It is learned that regarding the Beijing-Shanghai Line, three elite regular army divisions were transferred from the central government, totaling more than 40,000 men. They arrived at various locations on the Beijing-Shanghai Line earlier this month according to plan to make deployments. All original guerrilla forces scattered in various areas and engaged in attacking the enemy were reorganized by the regular army to serve as reserves, remaining in place to guard and not disturb civilian businesses. Pay and supplies are allocated by the central government.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Panicked: Setting up Works</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the war zone, most of the enemy forces in the rear have been dispatched to the front line for combat. The number of enemy soldiers guarding the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line is only about one division, and among these enemy forces, there are many conscripts newly recruited from within the country, so their strength is very weak. In recent days, the enemy has been setting up works along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, day and night. Because anti-war sentiments have recently intensified among the enemy forces in various places, and the puppet troops that have been incorporated into their ranks also occasionally defect, the enemy military authorities are uneasy, in a state of extreme tension and panic.</p>
<p>The command of the guerrilla war on the Beijing-Shanghai Line has been entrusted to Shangguan Yunxiang by the central government. It is now learned that he has arrived at a certain location and, together with the Director of the Jiangsu District Guerrilla Branch Office, ×××, are inspecting the Beijing-Shanghai Line and making preparations for a counterattack. It is anticipated that in the shortest possible time, a large-scale guerrilla war will be launched on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. As for the puppet troops, police, security teams, etc., in various counties that have submitted to the enemy, the central government has given them official recognition so that they can coordinate during the general counterattack.</p>
<p>Cao Changjin's Troops Charge into Changshu</p>
<p>The guerrillas led by Captain Cao Changjin charged into the west gate of Changshu on the evening of the 6th, leading his troops from Tangshizhen, surrounding the Jiangzhe Fourth District Pacification Headquarters, and forcing them to surrender their weapons. The puppet commander Xu Feng fled in panic when he heard the alarm. The remaining troops abandoned their weapons and surrendered. In this battle, Cao's troops captured 260 rifles, 57 Mauser pistols, and 12 light and heavy machine guns without shedding a drop of blood, and recruited 280 puppet police officers. With bugles blaring, they organized themselves and withdrew from the city, still lurking in the countryside, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers in Zhabei Add More Bunkers</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers in Shanghai, fearing attacks by our guerrillas, have increased their troops and set up defensive works in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, and western Shanghai. They have also sealed up houses in Nanshi and Zhabei to prevent guerrillas from hiding. On the 7th, Japanese and puppet forces carried out sealing work on empty houses in Pudong and western Shanghai. At the same time, they built more bunkers in areas such as Baziqiao, Miaoxing, and Zhongshan Road Bridge, stationing troops to defend them. On the one hand, Japanese soldiers patrol in groups of three or five, the state of fear being unprecedented. According to villagers traveling to and from the guerrilla areas, recently a large detachment of Japanese troops suddenly went to Beixinjing, Hongqiao, Hejiajiao, and other places to garrison, and the inspection of incoming and outgoing people has become stricter. In addition to the increased sentries at various waterway crossings, defensive objects have also been added. Trenches have also been dug day and night in the Chenjiazai area west of the Da West Road Railway. Around 9 a.m. on the 6th, those coming to Shanghai from western Shanghai heard booming cannon fire and dense machine gun fire. Judging from the situation, it seems that the Japanese army was conducting live ammunition exercises. However, in view of the tense atmosphere of navigation in western Shanghai recently, it is feared that guerrillas would attack, so they were just putting on a show of force as a demonstration.

<h3>Our Export Goods in January: Animal Products are the Most Numerous: Egg Exports Exceed Four Million: Germany Ranks First in Sales Areas</h3>
<p>[News from This Port] According to a recent report from our import and export customs, animal and animal products were the most numerous of our country's export goods in January of this year, accounting for the first place in national merchandise exports. The total value was 12,819,047 yuan in national currency, more than double that of the same period in the 27th year, a total of 6,605,887 yuan, and 3,167,827 yuan more than the same period in the 26th year. The export goods in this category include beef, pork, poultry, pig bristles, eggs, poultry feathers, hair, sheep intestines, ham, deer antlers, musk, animal oil, etc., but leather goods and fish and marine products are not included. Among these export goods, eggs are the largest category, including dried eggs, dried egg whites, egg yolks, frozen wet eggs, egg whites, egg yolks, fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and salted eggs, worth a total of 4,224,397 yuan in national currency, an increase of 2,282,614 yuan over the same period last year. The second largest is pork, worth 3,298,797 yuan in national currency, an increase of 1,731,221 yuan over the same period last year. As for the sales areas for these animals, Germany ranks first with 3,864,836 yuan in national currency, an increase of more than 40% over the same period last year. Hong Kong ranks second with 2,572,180 yuan, also showing a slight increase over last year. The United States accounts for 2,253,104 yuan. The United Kingdom, which ranked second in sales last year, fell to fourth place this year, with a total value of 2,006,388 yuan, but also an increase of one-half compared to the same period last year. Looking at the above figures, the general situation of our country's foreign trade can be seen, and it has not been affected by the war in any way, which is quite encouraging.</p>
<h3>Heroic Deeds of Youth and Students in Southern Hebei: Attacking Hengshui's Sichen School, Fierce Fighting for a Long Time, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to military intelligence, during this enemy invasion of Southern Hebei, the faculty and students of our Sichen School engaged in a desperate battle with the enemy, their deeds moving both gods and mortals, and striking fear into the enemy's hearts. On the 15th of last month, at 2 PM, approximately two to three hundred enemy troops, composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked the Zhao Jiaquan, Da Tianquan, and Li Jia areas of Hengshui, where our Sichen School was located. The faculty and students of the school immediately engaged the enemy with rifles. When the enemy infiltrated the village, the faculty and students threw grenades from the rooftops, killing fifty to sixty enemy soldiers and destroying three vehicles. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in disarray out of the village. The faculty and students then pursued them from the rooftops, resulting in fierce street fighting. Although the enemy relied on superior weaponry to launch a fierce offensive, they were ultimately repelled by the students' generous and courageous spirit. Subsequently, enemy reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce artillery barrage against our encirclement, leading to three to four hours of intense fighting. When our ammunition ran out, we launched a counter-offensive. Most of the students were underage youth, and some of the younger ones were unable to keep up with the charge. The faculty and students who had already broken through made repeated charges back and forth, finally breaking through the encirclement completely at 12:30 AM. Due to their youthful vigor, the faculty and students often disarmed the enemy with their bare hands. However, due to the vast disparity in numbers and the poor quality of our equipment, casualties were quite high. It is estimated that over a hundred enemy soldiers were killed and five enemy vehicles were destroyed in the battle. It is said that the government has provided preferential treatment and compensation to the teachers and students of the school.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Air Route: Chongqing-Alma Ata Route Being Planned; Expected to Open This Summer</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express News] Yesterday, according to official sources, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union after the War of Resistance, the Soviet military and civilians have shown consistent sympathy for China's war of resistance, providing us with tremendous spiritual assistance. Since President Sun's visit to the Soviet Union for observation, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have become increasingly close. Therefore, since September of last year, the Chinese and Soviet governments have begun to negotiate the establishment of a new direct passenger and postal air route. The negotiations have been very successful. Recently, they planned to open a new route from Chongqing to Alma Ata. This route is divided into two sections: the first section from Chongqing to Hami in Xinjiang, and the second section from Hami to Alma Ata. This matter is under active negotiation by both parties, and there is a great possibility of it being realized. It is expected to be realized in early summer this year. (New Voice Society)</p>

<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization (2): Full Text of the Outline</h3>
<p>Saving the Nation Through Morality</p>
<p>Today's need for China is to revive the declining, eliminate the invading enemy, and save the country. Therefore, what is needed from all of our citizens today is a unified morality that strives for practical action, which is the morality of saving the nation. This morality of saving the nation is inherent in our ancestors and is also the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The level of understanding of these eight virtues may vary among citizens, but the past continuation and glory of the Chinese nation depended on this morality, and today's decline and weakness are due to the loss of this morality. Therefore, it is imperative to require our citizens to uniformly establish this morality of saving the nation. Among the eight virtues, the most fundamental are loyalty and filial piety. Loyalty and filial piety are the great foundation of the Chinese nation, and the most precious treasures left by our ancestors to future generations over five thousand years. Now, at a time of national crisis, all compatriots must be loyal and filial to the utmost, dedicating their loyalty to the nation and their filial piety to the people. Let us first speak of filial piety. For thousands of years, the so-called filial piety in Chinese society has not only meant being filial to one's parents but also emphasizing filial piety to one's ancestors. Therefore, having no descendants to perform ancestral rites was considered the greatest sin. This applies to the direct ancestors of every individual. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of nationalism, he further elaborated and promoted the inherent Chinese filial piety to the nation, extending it from the love of one's relatives to the mutual protection of those of the same country and race, and from the pursuit of distant ancestors to the understanding of the interconnectedness of those of the same country and race. Therefore, the object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation, and we should strive not to disgrace our common ancestors. We should always remember that the beautiful rivers and mountains that our ancestors worked so hard to build and leave to us will be lost at our hands. Then, how can we face our ancestors above and our common descendants below? Other sins can be forgiven, but the absence of filial piety cannot be redeemed. If our compatriots understand this meaning, then sacrificing oneself to maintain the survival of the nation will surely be regarded as everyone's highest responsibility. Secondly, the so-called loyalty must first be loyalty to the nation. Loyalty to the nation is, in fact, the preservation of the survival and development of our people. In China today, everyone must regard protecting national independence as a sacred responsibility, and only then can the nation be saved. The nation has its absoluteness. To defend the freedom and independence of the nation, the primary condition is the absolute unification of military and political orders. Now that the violent enemy is destroying our nation with overwhelming force and creating puppet organizations in various occupied areas, attempting to divide our nation, all of our citizens must be united in loyalty to the nation to strengthen the nation's self-defense capabilities. Be loyal to your duties, loyal to discipline, loyal to laws and regulations, and never harbor any disunity or violate laws and regulations to weaken the nation's authority. If our people can truly be filial to the nation and loyal to the country, then the mission of resisting the enemy and saving the nation will have a reliable people to shoulder it. As for the virtues of benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace, they all evolve from the two virtues of loyalty and filial piety. Benevolence and love are the extension of filial piety, trustworthiness and righteousness are the extension of loyalty, and pacifism stems from the same source. Benevolence and love will prevent mutual slaughter, and peace is due to trustworthiness and righteousness. If we can promote the heart of benevolence and love today, then we will not sit idly by as our compatriots are humiliated and harmed, and we will surely have the courage to share a common hatred of the enemy. By promoting the heart of trustworthiness and righteousness, we will be able to be responsible and dedicated, honest and not deceptive, to create a united effort to face difficulties together. By promoting our thousands of years of inherent ideals of peace, we will gladly strive to resist violence and seek lasting peace, and we must take the lead in courageous and unyielding struggles. All of these virtues of saving the nation, when they exert their power, are no different from strong armor and sharp weapons. In essence, this is the spiritual weapon of the nation, and every citizen should arm themselves with it to drive out the violent enemy and create a glorious new history for our country.</p>
<p>Belief in Nation-Building</p>
<p>What is the ultimate purpose for which we today ask our people to converge on the same direction, establish the same morality, and strive hard? The ultimate purpose is to complete the construction of a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. As mentioned earlier, the significance of this war of resistance lies not only in repelling the enemy but also in establishing the foundation for nation-building. Therefore, even in wartime, we must never forget nation-building. Only by having a consistent and established nation-building policy and promoting it with all our strength can we fully exert the power to resist the enemy and seek victory. Only when all citizens can establish a belief in nation-building can the spiritual strength of the nation and the morality of saving the nation have a reliable place to be entrusted for positive development. Therefore, saving the nation and building the nation are inherently consistent and the same thing. The highest principle of China's nation-building is the Three Principles of the People, which were personally created by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. This is a common recognition among all compatriots in the country. Today, the existence or demise of the nation is at stake. If we win the war of resistance, then nation-building will surely be achieved, and the nation will enjoy permanent happiness and benefit. Therefore, our people must further consolidate their belief in the Three Principles of the People, our principles of nation-building, and strive together to achieve their realization. The goals of the Three Principles of the People are to promote equality in China's international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status. The country we want to build in our ideals is independent, free, and equal externally, and a country owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people internally. This is the common aspiration of everyone, and the Three Principles of the People are the only method to achieve this nation-building. Now, in wartime, the people are invigorated, and the trends are more unified. Saving the nation and building the nation should be advanced simultaneously. In terms of nationalism, resisting foreign aggression to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality is the sole purpose of today's war of resistance. The domestic ethnic groups working together in the cause of resisting the enemy can further enhance the unity of the entire nation and lay a solid foundation for the broad Chinese nation. In terms of democracy, the popularization of the people's political consciousness during wartime is sufficient to accelerate the cultivation of genuine democracy. The concentration and adjustment of government powers during wartime are sufficient to create a highly efficient politics. In terms of the people's livelihood, the efforts to increase production and control consumption during wartime are to establish the foundation for equitable distribution of the people's livelihood.

<h3>Former Governor-General of Vietnam Points Out: Japan's Enemy No. 1 is England, No. 2 is America. Enthusiastic Situation at the London Aid China Association</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Yesterday, the China Congress held a meeting here, chaired by Dr. Wang Jingqi. Dr. Xia said at the meeting, "Resistance and recovery are China's current slogans." Professor Bourbon said, "Japan implemented a planned destruction of major Chinese universities and libraries at the beginning of the war. Within fourteen months of the start of the war, the losses of Chinese educational institutions reached 21.7 million yuan. Currently, the need for books is extremely urgent. Oxford University plans to donate various types of books worth between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds to China in the next few years. There are now British suggestions to provide financial assistance to China's industries and encourage China's exports to Britain." Former Governor-General of Vietnam, Varenne, said, "As far as Japan is concerned, the number one enemy is not China, nor the Soviet Union, but England. The number two enemy is the United States." Mr. Rothstein said, "The Soviet Union does not hide that it continues to transport military materials to China and morally assist China."</p>
<h3>Southern Shanxi in Struggle: Politics, Economy, Culture, Civil Movement (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper: Shanxi War Zone Report</p>
<p>Shanxi was once an old province, but it is now a young and vibrant province. In northeastern Shanxi, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region was established; in southeastern Shanxi, it is a vast area controlled by the Eighth Route Army; in western Shanxi, our iron cavalry defends the Yellow River; and in southern Shanxi, we have equally valiant soldiers. The enemy only comes out to fight occasionally, and on the days they don't, it is our heroic soldiers' world. Shanxi is constantly at war!</p>
<p>Take southern Shanxi, where I currently live, for example! It is very different from the past. In the past, the people sighed and asked with despairing voices, "What do they want us to do?" "What can we do?" But now, they have stood up strongly. The young and strong have joined the self-defense forces, and women and old men are doing farm work as if nothing is happening under the rumbling of artillery fire. The children have joined the village-run national affairs and sing loudly after class: "Move forward, don't retreat, life and death have reached the final moment..." Because of the sacred War of Resistance against Japan, the old China has become young, the solidified places have become turbulent, and the farmers who were content with their lot in the past are now fighting.</p>
<p>Readers, please open your maps: You will see the counties of Yongji, Ruicheng, Yunxiang, Jiexian, Xiaxian, Anyi, Pinglu, Yuanqu, and Jiucheng along the northern bank of the Yellow River, which is what I am referring to as southern Shanxi. It can be said that the enemy exerts very little effort in these counties. Except for occupying a larger area in Yongji and Yunxiang, the enemy only occupies the railway line in Anyi and only Zhangdian Town in Pinglu. Jiucheng, Yuanqu, and Jiucheng are mostly in our hands. We rely on the towering Zhongtiao Mountains to consolidate our northern bank of the Yellow River. At the same time, this continuous Zhongtiao Mountain is our base for attacking the enemy and the location of our elusive guerrillas.</p>
<p>Apart from the military aspects of southern Shanxi, which we cannot conveniently report on, I must provide a general description of other aspects such as administration and civil movement:</p>
<p>Regarding administration, the candidates responsible for county administration are all county magistrates sent by the Shanxi Provincial Government. The county administration structure is much simpler than before. Shanxi does not have Baojia (a system of household registration and control), and below the county is the district office, and below the office is the village compilation. The village compilation takes one village as the main village and several villages as auxiliary villages. The village office is located in the main village, and there is also a Lu in the village, which is the smallest unit of village administration. The Lu has a Lu chief, and the village has a village chief and a village deputy, all of whom are elected by the people.</p>
<p>Among the county's administration, the most noteworthy are the economy and education. Although the economic situation here is under the active sabotage of the Japanese enemy, it has not had much impact. Because the method of reasonable burden has been implemented long ago, income and expenditure can still be barely balanced. As for Yongji, Yunxiang, Anyi, and other counties with more areas occupied by the enemy, their income is relatively lower. As for the daily life of the people, it has obviously improved due to the stationing of large troops. In Maojin, Pinglu, the price of grain once rose to one yuan for only one or two Jin of flour (usually one yuan could buy more than ten Jin), and the price of daily necessities was also very high. White sugar was one Hao per two, and it cost one yuan and six Jiao to buy one Jin.</p>
<p>There is still a great lack of spiritual food here. There are no lead-printed newspapers in this area. However, because of the convenient transportation, it is possible to see the newspapers from Xi'an and Luoyang every two or three days. In addition, there is also a "Qiao Han Daily" in Shaanxi County, which can be seen on the same day in Pinglu. Besides these, there are only mimeographed small newspapers. The mimeographed small newspapers include "Strike" (published by the Pinglu Strike Society), "National Salvation Weekly" (published by the Youth Salvation General Mobilization Committee), and "War of Resistance" (published by the 38th Army War Service Corps, now discontinued), which are all small sheets with half news and half text. Bound into volumes are "Lulin" (organ of the Sacrifice and Salvation Association); "Zhongtiao Voice" (published by the Sacrifice and Salvation Central District); "Battlefield" (published by the 38th Army War Service Corps); "Comrade-in-Arms" (published by the 31st Army Corps Comrade-in-Arms Society); "New Soldiers" (published by the headquarters of the 38th Army): "Half-Monthly Frontline" (published by the Political Department of the 17th Division), which are all semi-monthly publications, most of which are for their own people, but they are also suitable for general public reading. In addition to these, there are also wall newspapers published by the political departments of various armies.</p>
<p>Regarding education, every township has established a People's Revolutionary Primary School, and the teachers of the People's Primary School are mostly members of the Sacrifice and National Salvation League. The curriculum has also been changed to a curriculum against the enemy. The "Inked Grid" for primary school students to practice writing has also been changed from "Shang Da Ren Kong Yi Ji" to "We unite to drive away the Japanese enemy." As for the daily life of the students, in addition to attending classes, they also have military training and singing. An eleven- or twelve-year-old child has learned military common sense and the technique of throwing grenades. And songs like "Sacrifice has reached the final moment"; "Military-civilian cooperation"; "Defend the Yellow River" are sung while sitting and walking non-stop. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>British Acknowledge Czech Political Turmoil Will Not Affect Materials Bureau; Germany Still Closely Watching, Denies German Troops Crossed Czech Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] According to various visitors arriving here from Central Europe, they all expressed hope that Šídlo would form a new government to resolve the Slovakian political change, but acknowledged that Germany's attitude has not yet been decided, so the future development of the situation is still uncertain. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Observer" stated, "The official British opinion believes that the situation in Europe will not be affected by the sudden political change in Slovakia. According to various documents and intelligence received in London, it does not indicate that the coup in Slovakia was instigated by Germany. However, Slovakia's actions seem to have annoyed Hitler and Ribbentrop, because its request for assistance from Berlin is equivalent to proposing further action in Germany's Central European policy, which Ribbentrop is currently unwilling to propose. Therefore, on the one hand, the Vienna Radio Station was ordered to support the Slovak people, and on the other hand, Germany is trying to calm the high tension."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 12th] A high-ranking member of the National Socialist Party secretly departed for Bratislava last night, but his mission has not been disclosed. Furthermore, Vienna Radio Station broadcasts a speech every half hour in Slovak, urging the Slovak people to continue attacking the Czech government and condemning the Czech government for causing the current crisis. Tonight's broadcaster claimed that Czech troops are concentrated on the German-Czech border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 12th] A declaration here, with apparent authorization, stated, "The Czech capital's opposition to Slovakia's actions, which infringed upon Slovakia's autonomous rights, has made the international situation revert to darkness." The declaration mentioned Chamberlain and Halifax discussing the possibility of a disarmament agreement, stating, "This is not an unwelcome sign. Britain has now acknowledged that the Western countries did not accommodate some of Germany's proposals regarding disarmament, resulting in the loss of a good opportunity for countries to agree on disarmament. Germany believes that disarmament by the Western countries is indeed essential."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] People in Berlin believe that the Czech situation is extremely serious. Political figures pointed out that the Vienna Arbitration Agreement (i.e., the agreement established after the Munich Agreement when demarcating the border between Czech and Slovakia) placed significant responsibility on Germany and Italy for maintaining law and order within Czech. People here emphasized that the principles of self-determination and autonomy stipulated in the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Agreement have not been implemented. It has been evident since shortly after the Vienna Arbitration that the Czech government is unable to carry out reconstruction plans, and the situation between Czech and Slovakia has fallen into tension, ultimately leading to the current Slovak incident. The general impression here is that the centralist tendency of the Czech authorities arose from a desire to use time to change the existing situation. Furthermore, after Czech was divided, it is difficult for the remaining Bohemia and Moravia to maintain themselves. In addition, drawing a border between Czech and Slovakia that is ethnically and politically justifiable is, if not impossible, extremely difficult. What is more, Germany, as one of the arbitrators of the Vienna Arbitration, must seriously examine the situation in Czech and Slovakia and take responsibility for it. People here believe that maintaining law and order in Czechoslovakia is beneficial to European peace.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] No diplomatic activities related to the Slovak situation have been announced here. Berlin officials have so far only maintained close attention to the matter and indicated that Germany, as one of the guarantors of the Vienna Arbitration, is somewhat involved in the matter. Evening newspapers prominently published news from Bratislava, expressing sympathy for the Slovak people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Reports circulating outside that German troops have crossed the Czech border or intend to enter Czech territory have been denied by the German side.</p>
<h3>Slovakia Forms New Cabinet; Czech Troops Open Bratislava; Ďurčanský Attacks Czech Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 11th] The new Slovak cabinet has been formed, with Czech Deputy Prime Minister Šídlo serving as Prime Minister of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 11th] Slovak Acting Prime Minister Sidor yesterday notified the Czech capital government that he was unwilling to serve as Prime Minister. He is currently in Rome attending the Pope's coronation. Speaker of Parliament Sokol arrived here by plane today. He stated that he believes the current crisis will soon be overcome and is expected to be resolved tonight. Afterward, he visited Dr. Hodža. Officials denied that Germany had made any demands. It is generally believed that the current crisis may promote the reorganization of the Czech central government.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 11th] Today, ten military vehicles, fully loaded with Czech troops, arrived in Slovakia to reinforce the city, making the tense situation between the Slovak people and Czech troops even more serious. The Slovak people shouted loudly at the reinforcing Czech troops, "Shoot! We also have guns and cannons!" A large crowd surrounded the Czech barracks, shouting and demonstrating. Whenever Czech troops approached, they were forced to turn away. The Czech increase in administrative power in Slovakia has provoked resentment. Slovak Minister Dr. Šídlo broadcast to the public on the radio, saying that Czech troops would withdraw today. The Hlinka Guard team claimed that the Czech capital had forced Šídlo to compromise and mediate. Anti-Czech demonstrations will begin today throughout Slovakia. News came this morning that Czech police and Slovak students and Hlinka Guards had a serious clash. Czech police stabbed students with bayonets. Martial law has been declared in Saint Martin. Czech troops have occupied the Bratislava radio station and closed off the streets near the station, prohibiting traffic. This action is completely contrary to what Dr. Šídlo announced. According to reports from the Slovak front line, Czech troops are now mostly concentrated near Großgarting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 12th] The conflict in Slovakia resulted in three deaths, two of whom were members of the Hlinka Guard and one of whom was a German woman. The capital of Slovakia was extremely orderly yesterday. Currently, Czech troops are patrolling the streets. Arrested members of the Hlinka Guard and other Slovak officials are loaded into vehicles and driven through the streets.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 11th] Dr. Ďurčanský continued to attack the Czech capital government on the radio today. Ďurčanský stated that the Czech capital's dismissal of the Tiso cabinet was an illegal action, because to dismiss the Slovak cabinet, only the Slovak parliament could submit a vote of no confidence to be effective. Therefore, the Tiso cabinet should continue to perform its duties. Ďurčanský also heavily criticized the Czech side's arrest of Hlinka Guard leader General Ďurica and Slovak Propaganda Minister Mach.</p>
<h3>MacDonald and Jewish Representatives Hold Informal Meeting; No Progress Made</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Colonial Secretary MacDonald held an informal meeting with a delegation of Jewish representatives this afternoon, discussing in detail the letter submitted by the Jewish representatives to the British government yesterday morning. It is reported that all points in the letter were closely analyzed. No British proposal was mentioned, and no progress seems to have been made.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Still Being Shipped to Japan; Mostly Commercial Planes Announced</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to the government's arms control department, various countries have obtained export permits. The value of aircraft purchased is 5,594,428 gold yuan for France, of which military aircraft accounted for over 5 million yuan, 11,711,030 yuan for the United Kingdom, of which military aircraft accounted for 11,115,600 yuan, and only 223,224 yuan for China, of which 188,563 yuan has been paid for. The U.S. government has not issued permits to Japan, but in fact, aircraft worth 139,490 yuan were shipped to Japan, but most of them were commercial aircraft and those that had previously obtained permits.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Longshoremen in Portland and Astoria, on the U.S. West Coast, strongly refused to load scrap iron onto five Japanese transport ships. The Japanese ambassador consulted with State Department officials on "steps to be taken" to allow the Japanese ships to sail as usual, but did not lodge a protest. The State Department remained silent and had no comment.</p>
<h3>Sinclair Speech Maintains International Law and Order; National Consensus Agreed; British MP Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] At the London China Conference today, the issue of the war in China from the perspective of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union was discussed. British Liberal Party leader in the House of Commons, Sinclair, also participated in the meeting, saying that dictatorial countries have two major points in common, namely, jointly suppressing China on the one hand, and supporting another dictatorial country, Japan, on the other hand. However, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Western democratic countries also have one point in common, which is to establish the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and maintain international law and order, while also being willing to witness China's growing prosperity and progress. Labor Party MP in the British House of Commons, Noel-Baker, said that he hoped the British government could cooperate with the United States and France to impose economic sanctions on Japan, prohibiting all Japanese goods from being imported. This move would not only help China but also bring an end to the endless ashes of Japanese soldiers from China to Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Secretary Advocates Establishing Atlantic Base; Building Ships for Latin American Countries; State Department Gives Enthusiastic Endorsement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Charleston, 12th] U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson, before departing for the West Indies to recuperate from his chronic illness, made a statement saying that the recent U.S. Navy exercises in the Caribbean Sea proved that the opinions of naval experts were very correct. The United States really needs to establish bases for submarines, destroyers, and aircraft in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, at a press conference this evening, stated, "The State Department enthusiastically endorses the construction of warships for the governments of Latin American countries by U.S. naval shipyards. Necessary legislation is currently under consideration so that naval shipyards can carry out this task, but the defense of the United States is the most important thing. Work for foreign countries must not affect the expansion of the U.S. Navy."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to a statement by U.S. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Pittman, he will submit a bill to Congress next week to allow South American countries to build warships in U.S. naval shipyards and consider building them at the lowest possible price in order to compete with European dictatorial countries and reduce their threat to South America. The diplomatic aspect is paying close attention to this move because the agreement between the United States and Brazil was just announced three days ago.</p>
<h3>Pope's Coronation, Yesterday's Atrocity at St. Peter's Basilica; Representatives from Various Countries Attended</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican, 11th] Pius XII will hold a solemn and grand coronation ceremony tomorrow, as usual, to assume the position of Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church. All ceremonies will be held on the platform of St. Peter's Basilica, so that hundreds of thousands of people in the square can witness everything. This method is unprecedented since the coronation of Pius IX in 1846. The coronation ceremony will take about five hours. First, the Pope will be seated on a portable throne and sent into St. Peter's Basilica. Various countries will appoint diplomatic envoys to participate in the grand ceremony. The United Kingdom will send the Duke of Norfolk as a special envoy to represent the British King. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy will represent President Roosevelt, and Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo will participate. Other important representatives include Ireland's de Valera, Italian Crown Prince Umberto, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The tiara to be used tomorrow contains three gold bars inlaid on silver bars, with a white velvet base. The entire tiara is inlaid with hundreds of precious jewels, but it is still very light and can be worn for a long time without feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Cries Out for Colonial Territories by Force; Italian Ambassador Prevents British Foreign Office</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 12th] The "International Relations" newspaper published an article last night regarding Italian colonial demands, stating, "The time for redrawing the world colonial map has now arrived. If Germany and Italy cannot obtain a just peace, they will use force to obtain justice. The Berlin-Rome axis is determined to seek survival. No amount of military expansion can stop this right to survival. What Italy seeks now is justice, and it will surely be victorious."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The Italian Embassy here issued a notice today stating that the Italian Ambassador yesterday</p>
<h3>Stalin Delivers Speech; Condemns Acts of Aggression; Sternly Criticizes Policy of Concession; Strengthens Combat Power of Red Army</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] In a speech at the Soviet Communist Party Congress, Stalin sternly criticized Chamberlain's foolish policy of concession. According to the full text of Stalin's speech published by official forces, the acts of aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan were detailed one by one. "Today's wars are purely launched by aggressor countries against Britain, the United States, and France, but the latter retreat and retreat again, making concessions and concessions again, so that the aggressor countries can openly redistribute the world's spheres of influence, causing non-aggressor countries to suffer sacrifices. Democratic countries not only turn a blind eye but also openly acquiesce. This kind of thing is hard to believe, but it is indeed a fact. For example, the policy of non-interference is tantamount to acquiescing to acts of aggression. Pacifism and disarmament plans are all dead and buried. Some say that the Munich Agreement is another way of building a policy of concession. Such seemingly right but actually wrong and eloquent words have become incredible, even the signatory countries of the Munich Agreement feel the same way. The Soviet Union cannot ignore this ominous event and should strengthen the combat power of the Red Army and Navy in the future in case of emergency."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 11th] Stalin said in a speech at the Soviet Communist Party Congress, "Foreign conspirators use the Soviet Union as a pawn of capitalist countries, not aggressor countries! Britain and France! Have abandoned the policy of collective security and moved towards a policy of non-interference and neutrality. I would like to warn the Western democratic countries that once this policy of non-interference is adopted, dangers and difficulties will inevitably arise." Stalin continued to mention the Ukrainian issue, saying, "Some parties have been constantly spreading rumors that Germany intends to take Ukraine, and their purpose is obviously to create a conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany. What is their intention? It is clear to all."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tbilisi, 11th] Today, the subcommittees of the Soviet Communist Party Congress resolved two resolutions, expressing their disagreement with the British foreign policy of "constantly promoting fascist efforts." This resolution will be submitted to the full body for review tonight.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Subtly Destroy Commercial Interests of Various Countries in China; American Business Community Reports to Government</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to reports from the business community here to the government, Japanese industries will soon launch a trade "counterattack" in the Far East, attempting to subtly destroy all commercial interests of various countries in China. The plan of this "counterattack," according to non-official statements, is quite fierce and may break out immediately. It is reported that the Japan Industrial Association has decided to use various means in all Japanese-occupied areas to control foreign businesses, forcing foreign businesses that handle import and export goods to go through Japanese brokers if they want to operate, otherwise, they will have no business to do. This is used to force foreign businesses to abandon their various rights and interests. Although this plan is not related to the regulations promulgated by Japanese officials restricting imports and exports in occupied areas, it is, in fact, intensifying the implementation of those regulations and exerting double pressure on foreign businesses to eliminate the existence of foreign commercial interests in China. Visiting the British Foreign Office was purely a routine visit, and there was no connection with the general political situation.</p>
<h3>National Defense Forces and Communist Party Engage in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Burgos, 12th] It is reported that the Communist Party's forces are now pushing forward into the Rullamenco district, which is the best residential area of Madrid. The National Defense Forces are still occupying the United Radio Station building, and fierce fighting is taking place nearby. It is reported that the militias of Murcia, Alicante, and Casarrubios have been driven back by the Communist Party's forces.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 11th] The Communist Party here, because the headquarters of its Central Committee and local committees have been shelled, surrendered unconditionally to General Casado's forces this afternoon. Prior to this, the Communist Party sent several tanks, but they failed to reach their headquarters. After an hour of fierce fighting, several Communist Party members looked out from the windows of a building and saw Franco's troops in front of them, so they threw down their guns. However, this does not mean that the "war within a war" has come to an end, because severe measures are still being taken against the Communists occupying other buildings.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Crashes; Four Officers and One Civilian Die</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Milan, 12th] A German aircraft, flying from Tripoli to Stettin, crashed in Duca, near Ferrara. Two German officers in the aircraft parachuted out and escaped. Four other officers and one civilian were killed.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Yu Bin Denounces Anti-Communism</h3>
<p>[Washington Air Mail] Bishop Yu Bin arrived in Washington on the 13th of last month, met with the Papal Representative to the United States, and held a press conference at the Chinese Embassy, delivering an important written speech correcting the Japanese international propaganda that falsely accused China of being communist. Bishop Yu first pointed out: In recent years, the Japanese have been spreading the "anti-communist" war doctrine in the United States to stir up American isolationists to oppose the U.S. government's aid to China; then used the facts to illustrate that China's War of Resistance is not only for survival but also for humanitarian justice. The Japanese "anti-communist war" fallacy is just like Hitler and Mussolini's advocacy of "anti-communism," while in reality, they are overthrowing democratic politics, expanding territory, and implementing their policy of aggression. American newspapers have all published Bishop Yu's remarks. On February 19, overseas Chinese in New York held a "One Hundred Ambulance Movement Rally" under the leadership of Bishop Yu. More than 10,000 people participated, raising more than one million U.S. dollars in four hours.</p>
<p>We hope that people in friendly countries will pay attention to Bishop Yu's remarks and the facts that countless Catholic and Christian leaders have led church members to participate in the united front of the heroic War of Resistance over the past twenty months. We hope that the Chinese people, especially overseas Chinese and the media and education sectors, can take Bishop Yu as a model to expand the publicity of national salvation and correct the vision of China and foreign countries. We should especially give relentless blows to the Japanese and traitors who spread the rhetoric of Japan waging an "anti-communist war."</p>
<h3>Strengthening Aid to China Line</h3>
<p>After the announcement of Britain's re-loan of £5 million to China, China's financial situation has become more optimistic, and the international aid to China situation is developing day by day. A Shanghai dispatch on the 12th stated: According to news from Paris, France will also soon ship a large number of armaments to China. News also stated that China and France have reached an agreement that the French side will transport 300 military transport vehicles and 200 mortars currently in the Netherlands to China, and 300 French experts will be dispatched to China to assemble the armaments. Furthermore, the London China Conference held on the 11th called on the UK, the US, and democratic countries to implement economic sanctions against Japan, and Labor MP Noel-Baker called on the UK to cooperate with the US and France to sanction Japanese aggression, saying that this move would not only benefit China but also save Japan from danger. From this, it can be seen that the democratic and peaceful countries are uniting to actively aid China and sanction Japan. We must strengthen our national diplomacy efforts to promote this movement. At the same time, we must adhere to the united war of resistance and step up the elimination of all conspiracies of "peace," "compromise," and "understanding the Sino-Japanese War."</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>A Moscow dispatch on the 11th stated that Stalin spoke at the 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, righteously condemning the policy of compromise with the aggressors pursued by some peaceful democratic countries, and finally reiterated the Soviet foreign policy as:</p>
<p>(1) Continue the policy of peace and promote commercial relations between the Soviet Union and other countries;</p>
<p>(2) Guard against provocateurs who attempt to draw the Soviet Union into international wars;</p>
<p>(3) Use all methods to strengthen the strength of the Soviet Union's navy;</p>
<p>(4) Enhance the unity and friendship between the Soviet Union and all countries concerned with peace.</p>
<p>At this time of increasingly urgent international situation, the leader of the Soviet Union, sought by the world, spoke and condemned the policy of compromise with the peace-loving countries and the aggressors. This is enough to refute the rumor that the Soviet Union does not care about the suffering of the invaded countries, and to greatly strike the rumor. Reiterating the four points of foreign policy, on the one hand, fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's determination not to threaten other countries. For the "anti-communist" and "anti-Soviet" conspiracies of aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, it should be a major blow; and on the other hand, it also fully shows that "the Soviet Union cannot be threatened by others," which can increase its credibility in the world, and its policy of establishing a grand alliance of peaceful countries and realizing a collective security system to seek world peace is even more necessary for the world today.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Memory: An Eyewitness Account of Austria's Downfall</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dong Ping</p>
<p>Vienna, March 10, 1938.</p>
<p>It was a cold, foggy, and gloomy morning in March. The harsh winter had reluctantly departed, and the early spring, eagerly awaited by all, had not yet arrived. This day will be forever etched in the hearts of those who experienced it firsthand, never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>If you had walked the streets of Vienna on the morning of March 10th, you would have undoubtedly noticed a peculiar atmosphere, suggesting that something extraordinary was about to happen. Thousands upon thousands of posters and leaflets were scattered throughout the streets and alleys, carried by gusts of wind to every corner of the city. These leaflets contained the order issued by Chancellor Schuschnigg from Innsbruck the previous night, setting March 13th as the date for a national plebiscite to determine the fate of Austria.</p>
<p>Groups of municipal workers were busy painting government slogans on sidewalks, shop windows, and along the walls of streets. Countless flags fluttered from shop entrances, and large warning signs were attached to lampposts and trees, expressing a vow to support the government to the death.</p>
<p>Teams of patriotic youth groups marched through the streets, constantly chanting slogans to protect the Chancellor. Chancellor Schuschnigg was scheduled to return to Vienna from Innsbruck by express train at eight o'clock that morning.</p>
<p>There was not a trace of instability. As the young people marched through the streets, cheering, the people standing by echoed their support for the government and the Chancellor. It was generally believed that the success of the vote was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>When Chancellor Schuschnigg's train arrived, nearly ten thousand people crowded the square in front of the station. As soon as the Chancellor stepped off the train, he seemed to immediately hold a meeting in the station office. About twenty minutes later, he walked to the car that was waiting outside the station. His face was very serious and pale; he did not look at the crowd. His attitude was clearly different from that of the crowd that was cheering him as "Austria's Savior." His car quickly drove along the Mariahilfer Strasse, through the arena, past the Parliament building and the Burgtheater, and headed straight for the Chancellor's office in the Ballhausplatz.</p>
<p>Wherever the Chancellor passed, the crowds cheered enthusiastically. This was the last time the people of Vienna saw their Chancellor, Schuschnigg.</p>
<p>For the next few hours, the situation was generally calm. It was evident that the National Socialists had indeed caught Schuschnigg off guard with the sudden announcement of the plebiscite, leaving him at a loss. They were waiting for new instructions from Berlin. However, around eleven o'clock in the morning, small groups of Nazi demonstrators began to appear in the area around the arena; however, most of them were young boys. They shouted the Nazi slogans: One People, One Nation, One Leader. But it was futile. They could not compete with the government supporters in terms of numbers or volume.</p>
<p>Police were rarely seen. Undoubtedly, they were following the secret orders of Interior Minister Arthur Seyss-Inquart not to interfere with the Nazi demonstrators. Therefore, they did not arrest a single one. Only when Nazi figures were surrounded and beaten did they rush to provide protection.</p>
<p>By noon, the crowds at the intersection of Kärntner Straße and near the Kent Straße had become so dense that it was impossible to move. The police were extremely busy; even they seemed panicked and confused. Several police officers openly admitted that they had received conflicting orders from all sides in the past few hours.</p>
<p>At first, the Nazis only sent young men and women aged fifteen to twenty to run around in the streets. Now, groups of older people were also appearing on the streets; some were wearing black boots, indicating they were members of the Blackshirts, and others were wearing the short socks of the Sturmabteilung uniforms. However, soon after, the streets once again became the domain of government supporters, as a group of several hundred Catholic and Fatherland Front students suddenly swarmed out of the alleys, drove the Nazi demonstrators out of the competition arena, and chased them to the streets of the Eighth District. This was the first and last time that the government supporters had a successful showing that day. Even the police were on the government's side.</p>
<p>By two o'clock in the afternoon, Nazi figures had completely disappeared from the entire First District and the area around the arena. Everything was under the complete control of the patriots.</p>
<p>But this did not last long.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, the students suddenly retreated, and a quarter of an hour later, the Nazis all came back. To avoid clashes between the two sides, the police blocked off the middle of the Kärntner Straße, leaving half the street and a sidewalk on each side. In the eyes of the police, this undoubtedly equated the supporters of the government with those who sought to overthrow it.</p>
<p>This fact was clear to both groups of demonstrators. As a result, the government supporters appeared disheartened, and their numbers also decreased significantly, as many of the leaders went home for lunch. Meanwhile, the Nazi shouts grew louder and more aggressive.</p>
<p>At the same time, shop owners began to close their doors and lock their windows. Women, who had previously played an important role on both sides, also became less enthusiastic. The shouting in the streets continued incessantly, followed by the sound of stones breaking windows, which rang out one after another.</p>
<p>A moment of silence, as quiet as a church. But shortly thereafter, the inevitable happened: the National Socialists suddenly broke through the police cordon—who offered little resistance—and pounced on the group of patriots. A melee ensued. Hats, sticks, suitcases, umbrellas, belts, and everything else became weapons. Obviously outnumbered, the patriots were forced to retreat towards Stephansplatz, where they made their last stand.</p>
<p>An old man, wearing a bowler hat and a leather jacket, like a retired soldier of the Imperial Army, suddenly rushed forward, seized an Austrian flag that had fallen from the front of a shop, and led the crowd forward. They were only about a hundred people, but they managed to reclaim most of the Kärntner Straße from that large group of swastika people. However, near the Kapuzinerkirche, they encountered the police. After a fierce fight, their flag was taken, and that brought an end to it. From then on, everything belonged to the Nazis. The time was 3:45 p.m. on March 10, 1938.</p>
<p>This is a time that everyone should remember, because it only happens once in a thousand years. At that time, Austria was lost.</p>
<p>Not on March 11, when Schuschnigg announced his resignation, nor on March 13, when Hitler announced the annexation of Austria. In reality, it was at 3:45 p.m. on March 10, 1938, near the Kapuzinerkirche, that Austria truly fell. (Translated from the "Deutsches Nachrichtenblatt für Ostasien" of Hong Kong on March 10.

<h3>Hong Kong Compatriots Solemnly Commemorate the Anniversary of Premier Sun's Death at the Queen's Theatre Yesterday: Premier Sun's Spirit is Entrusted to the People, and We Should Carry Forward His Spirit</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's death. All Hong Kong community organizations flew their flags at half-mast to express their condolences. The All-Circles Relief Association led Hong Kong compatriots to the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 a.m. yesterday to hold a commemorative meeting in order to promote Premier Sun's spirit of creating the Republic of China. Celebrities from all walks of life and representatives from community organizations attended. In addition to a simple and solemn ceremony, reports on Premier Sun's life and speeches were given by revolutionary pioneers He Xiangning, Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, etc. The atmosphere of the entire venue was extremely solemn and the mood was tragic. The meeting gradually concluded at twelve o'clock. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Setting of the Venue</p>
<p>The Queen's Theatre was used as the venue. A white cloth banner was hung in front of the door, reading "Commemorative Meeting for the 14th Anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's Death." On both sides were girls from the Lizexue Middle School Girl Scout Troop, standing on either side, energetic and full of solemn and heroic spirit. The hall was decorated very simply. In the center of the platform hung a portrait of Premier Sun, lifelike, inspiring admiration in all who saw it. On the left and right were the Party and national flags, with a banner reading "Commemorative Meeting for the 14th Anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's Death" also hung on the flags. A row of chairs was arranged on the platform for the chairman and veteran revolutionaries staying in Hong Kong. A table and a microphone were placed in front, and the tables behind were covered with blue and white satin. The silver band was arranged in front of the stage, and the girl scouts stood on all sides to maintain order. The atmosphere inside was extremely solemn and dignified, and everyone paid infinite respect to Premier Sun's great spirit. At the same time, they felt the great responsibility of those who came after him. Celebrities present on the day included Ye Gongchuo, He Xiangning, Qu Fangpu, Madam Wu Tiecheng, Zheng Hongnian, Luo Yiqun, Mr. and Mrs. Xu Qian, Madam Wu Chaoshu, Ye Lanquan, Liu Qingxuan, Chen Tieyi, etc., as well as male and female students from schools in all fields, representatives of various organizations, etc., more than ten people. Chairman Ye Gongchuo led the ceremony as required and delivered an opening speech. Ye Gongchuo's speech briefly stated that all comrades present, today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang. Looking back to this day fourteen years ago, unfortunately, the Premier passed away in Beijing. In these fourteen years, the changes in the world situation and the changes in personnel have been extremely complex. We are in a period of severe national crisis, remembering that the Premier took great risks and went through great difficulties to create the Republic of China. We feel extremely sad and ashamed. In the past ten years, outstanding party members and elders such as Liao Zhongkai, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Xunqin, and Deng Zeru have passed away one after another. This is indeed a great loss to our party. Everyone must know that the Premier is not a relative or friend of our family or clan, but the Father of the Republic of China, the pioneer of the Chinese nation, and the savior of the Chinese nation. Although his tangible form has diminished with matter, his spirit will always exist. But his spirit is indeed entrusted, and at least part of it is entrusted to the people of the whole country. We should try our best to express this great spirit in facts. I remember that when the Premier passed away in Beijing, he was still concerned about the country's affairs. The detailed situation will be reported by Mr. He. "The Premier's greatness, the meaning of today's meeting, please do not think that it is a kind of etiquette, or only belongs to the relationship between relatives and friends. Now our country, that is, the Republic of China created by the Premier, is in grave danger. We must preserve and revitalize what the Premier has painstakingly built, so that we are worthy of being members of the nation and worthy of the Premier's spirit in heaven. Although we are in Hong Kong today, there are as many as one million compatriots in Hong Kong. I hope that after today, everyone can have a deep understanding of the national situation and the world situation, so that it is enough to express the meaning of this commemoration. May everyone be healthy."</p>
<p>Deng Hongnian's Report</p>
<p>Then Zheng Hongnian reported on the life of Premier Sun Yat-sen, saying that today is the day when our Premier Sun passed away in Beijing 14 years ago and bid farewell to our compatriots forever. It is one of the saddest days. Taking advantage of this commemorative meeting, brothers will briefly tell the compatriots present the situation when the Premier passed away in Beijing and the process of his illness. Since the Premier has been running around for the revolution, he has been fighting for China's peaceful reunification all the time. The Premier's trip to Beijing was not to compete for the status of the people and land, but to discuss China's peaceful reunification with Duan Qirui, Zhang Zuolin, and others. At the same time, he requested the dispatch of cadres abroad to contact various countries in the world to abolish our country's unequal treaties. Unexpectedly, not long after arriving in Beijing, his old illness relapsed and he passed away in Ping. The Premier's great revolutionary spirit should be emulated by today's young people. The Premier fought for China's peace, so he said that he would unite the world to treat our people equally and fight together, so that the whole country would be united in good faith from top to bottom, and we would have unified long ago if we had embarked on this path, why wait until today. We want the revival of the people, just as the Premier said, we must struggle. The Premier once said that if our country is unified, twenty years later, it will be the strongest country in the world, and then unite the weak and small people of the world and the nations that treat us equally to seek world peace, not like the current imperialist countries, which invade all day long. I hope that all Hong Kong compatriots should promote the Premier's spirit of peace to the international community as much as possible, so that people from all countries will know that the Premier's spirit is to fight for world peace, so that we can show our country's spirit of resistance. Our country has been resisting for almost two years. In these two years of resistance, the spirit and performance of our government, the generals in front, and the people in the rear, especially the spirit of peace and struggle left by the Premier, have been admired by all countries in the world. This is all due to our top leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who has fulfilled the Premier's unfinished will. Then Ms. He Xiangning gave a speech on the greatness of Premier Sun (already published in yesterday's newspaper). Finally, the veteran revolutionary Xu Jilong gave a speech on the spirit of the Premier. The meeting adjourned at about twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>He Xiangning's Speech</p>
<p>Following was a speech by Ms. He Xiangning. She was wearing a black-spotted dress and a black felt hat. Everyone paid close attention to her, because she was old and sick, and every time she spoke, her emotions were so intensely affected that she needed to rest for three to five days to recover after her speech. She first described the brief history of the Premier's founding of the Kuomintang, and then she talked about the Premier's last words in his will, "uniting the world's nations that treat us equally." This teaching means that now the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and many other countries are treating our nation equally, especially the United Kingdom, which recently loaned us a huge amount of money to help our displaced compatriots. This should be especially thanked." A burst of thunderous applause interrupted her words. Then she said that the Premier was not a man with an army of 100,000, but just the son of a middle-class family, a medical student, and from his compassionate nature, he developed the ambition to treat people and cure the country. He saw the people of the whole country suffering from the brutal oppression, and making painful groans like the sick, so he decided to revolutionize and save all the patients in China!" Another burst of thunderous applause, her breathing was a little tight, but she continued to say, "Fellow compatriots, you are probably all very patriotic, so we should all show our strength, ×××××, we must not let down the good intentions of our international justice friends, and continue the Premier's indomitable will. We must not be discouraged, we must not be afraid of failure, everyone must be determined to succeed or die, and work hard to revitalize our new China!" Saying this, she clenched her fists tightly and stomped her feet hard on the stage. In the midst of continuous applause, she kept panting and returned to her seat. From the seat, she vaguely heard her pulse beating rapidly. In fact, some people were almost moved to tears.</p>
<p>Finally, Xu Jilong gave a speech. Although he was not in good health, he reluctantly struggled to describe the Premier's deeds eloquently.</p>
<h3>The Ruisheng Ship Transports Medicines to Haiphong to Transfer Relief to Refugees in the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Ship Company's Ruisheng ship sailed from Hong Kong to Haiphong yesterday. The ship was loaded with medicines and daily necessities. It was found that this batch of goods was donated by various organizations in Hong Kong and purchased by the Emergency Refugee Relief Association and the British Relief to China Branch with a donation of 50,000 yuan. Other organizations, such as women's groups, Chinese Salvation Groups, and the New York, England, and Luguo China Medical Relief Association, also made donations. After a large number of donations were collected, the loading was completed, and the Ruisheng ship was hired the day before yesterday to be transported from Hong Kong to Haiphong. Lin Kanghou and two other doctors, Batuhen and Italu, were on the same ship. After this batch of medicines arrives in Haiphong, it will be transferred to Guizhou, Guangxi, and Sichuan in batches for relief. The 50,000 yuan of medicines donated by the British Relief to China Association are designated for the relief of refugees in southern Guangxi. As for other items such as cloth and daily necessities, various organizations have donated a lot. In addition, the Taikoo Ship Company charged a very low ship rental for renting out the ship to transport medicines this time.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Staying in Hong Kong Confer on Relief for Out-of-School Children</h3>
<p>Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong believe that refugees from all over the world are gathering in Hong Kong, among whom there are countless school-age children and out-of-school young people. In order to prevent them from wasting their school years or dropping out of school during their escape and to cultivate talents, they specially convened a meeting the day before yesterday. The attendees were Hu Wencan, Lu Yougang, Huang Linshu, Luo Yiqun, Chen Ce, Deng Qingyang, and others, and Lu Kuangwen and others were present. Lu Yougang raised the issue for discussion. After the meeting, Hu Weiyuan said that relief for out-of-school children is an important issue at present. This matter should be entrusted to Xu Chongqing, director of the Guangdong Education Department, before he leaves Hong Kong and returns to Shao. In the future, some civilian schools will be established in Hong Kong, and the school site will be borrowed from various Chinese schools in Hong Kong. All out-of-school students will be admitted, and tuition fees will be waived. If necessary, only book fees will be charged, and the minimum cost will be used or completely waived so that out-of-school students can continue their studies. At the same time, in order to provide relief for unemployed educators, it is designated to recruit unemployed teachers to take up teaching positions and provide the minimum living expenses to take care of both sides and achieve a double benefit.</p>
<h3>The Minying Ship Sinks a Sampan and Two Women Fall into the River and Are Rescued</h3>
<p>The Minying ship, a Hong Kong-Cheung Chau ferry, was coming from Cheung Chau to Hong Kong at 7:30 p.m. today. When it was about to depart, the ship reversed, and a sampan in the rear was unable to avoid it and was sunk by the Minying ship. Two egg women on the sampan fell into the sea and shouted for help. The Minying ship immediately stopped and threw life buoys to rescue them. However, it was already night, and the sea was very dark, making rescue extremely difficult. Fortunately, there were many large fishing boats nearby, which used electric hand lamps to illuminate and see where the two egg women were, and they were rescued. However, the sampan was sunk. This incident delayed the Minying ship's arrival in Hong Kong by several tens of minutes.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Guide Industry Will Hold a Meeting This Afternoon to Establish Rules and Regulations to Improve the Profession</h3>
<p>In major cities of various countries, there are original guide agencies, which are purely for guiding tourists from all over the world, admiring scenic spots, and attending banquets and entertainment venues. Those who work in this profession have no improper actions. Hong Kong is only in the midst of prosperity, and the establishment of this kind of business is necessary to guide visitors to visit. Among them, the Hong Kong guide industry is also booming. However, some guide agencies use the name of guide to cover up other businesses, which is highly criticized by people in society. It is heard that the Hong Kong government is considering whether travel agencies can exist for the sake of maintaining social morality. Therefore, those who have applied for approval to establish travel agencies in recent days have not been answered. Some people who are enthusiastic about social education have once convened the persons in charge of various guide agencies to discuss ways to improve their profession and formulate rules to punish unscrupulous guides, so that they can return to the right path and be guides for the sake of guiding. The responders include Hollywood Great China, Metropolis, Xianghai, New New, Royal Palace, Nanfeng, Peach Red, Golden, Red Star, Traffic, South Needle, Guide, Kowloon, Champion, Xianhe, etc. more than ten companies. It is heard that a meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon to pass the rules and regulations so that all guide colleagues can abide by them and file them with the Chinese Civil Affairs Department. It is heard that a voluntary guide will be held soon to fulfill the obligation of saving the country.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Machinery Engineering Team in Penang Returns to China to Serve and Passes Through Hong Kong on the Anhui Ship Yesterday, Bringing a Large Batch of Medicines</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have spared no effort to donate money or return to China to serve. There have been several batches of drivers' teams returning to China, and there is still a constant stream of them. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, another group of the Overseas Chinese Machinery Engineering Team in Penang returned to China to serve on the Anhui ship and arrived in Hong Kong. There were 33 members in the team, including one woman. According to the team leader Liang Yutang, the team believes that the motherland is in trouble and the situation is serious. At the same time, there is a shortage of drivers and team members. The team members, seeing this, resolutely sacrificed their original occupations and joined the machinery workers to return to China to serve. The Penang Machinery Workers' Association has a total of 2,000 people, and their lives are extremely difficult, but they are very enthusiastic about donations. Almost every worker allocates 30% of their salary to be used for relief work. The team passed through Hong Kong this time, first passing through Singapore, where they stayed for about ten days, and were treated with courtesy by the local compatriots. The team started its journey to Hong Kong on the 17th, and was also well received by the ship's staff. When they arrived, they were welcomed by members of the Chinese Machinery Workers' Association. Brothers feel very happy, but they are determined to do their best to serve the country. As for the date when the team will return to the mainland to serve, it has not yet been decided and will be implemented after reporting. This time, they brought back a large batch of medicines. The list of team members is recorded as follows: Team leader Liang Yu, Yu Guosheng, Deng Bingxiang, Wang Fuxing, Liao Jiaxiang, Zhou Wengui, Wu Tiansheng, Fan Ronghui, Liang Jinhong, Ye Qingquan, Luo Huogui, Guo Canhua, Xue Wei, Wu Ruitian, Zhou Ruirong, Wu Fuji, Huang Renda, Lin Wenqi, Chen Jinyou, Xu Rong'an, Huang Jinfu, Zeng Qinglin, Shi Songmin, Chen Bingji,</p>
<h3>The Women's Temperance Association Banquets Celebrities Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the South China Branch of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association has organized the First Refugee Industrial Society, which has achieved remarkable results. The association has recently prepared to establish the Second Industrial Society. Yesterday, the association's members Liu Wang Liming, Li Wang Huazhen, and Liang Bao Ci jointly invited celebrities from all walks of life and famous Hong Kong opera actors to a luncheon at the Great China Hotel. Among those who attended were Xu Shiying, Zheng Hongnian, Ye Gongchuo, Miss Jin Suqin, Miss Lu Lan, and others, totaling more than 50 people. First, Liu Wang Liming gave a speech, reporting on the recent work of the Women's Temperance Association and the preparation for the Second Refugee Industrial Society, and incidentally reported on the situation of this session of the Political Participation Council. The establishment of the Second Refugee Industrial Society requires a lot of funding, so we especially ask for assistance from all sectors. On the one hand, we plan to ask famous Hong Kong opera actors and playwrights to help us with charity performances to raise money. After the speech, Xu Shiying gave a speech, praising the achievements of the Refugee Industrial Society. Then Ye Gongchuo and Zheng Hongnian gave speeches one after another. The banquet ended at 2:30 p.m. It is heard that Yihua opera actors and others have now begun to prepare for a Peking opera performance, and will also invite Ms. Jin Suqin, a salvation opera actress who recently arrived in Hong Kong, and other famous Peking opera actors to perform together. At that time, there will be a new and refreshing Peking opera performance.</p>
<h3>Nanfan Nine Counties All Report Rice Shortage: Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Discusses Relief</h3>
<p>Since [omission] entered Guangzhou, the various areas of Guangdong province have faced the risk of food shortages due to disrupted transportation. Adding to this, a certain large company has been massively buying and exporting rice from rice-producing areas, exacerbating the public panic. Earlier this year, the Chaozhou and Meizhou areas requested the Ministry of Finance to grant tax-free import of foreign rice due to rice shortages. Recently, nine counties, including Nanfan, Zhongshan, and Shunde, have also seen food panic. The military and political authorities in these areas have successively telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting measures to be taken to alleviate the situation and maintain food supply. The Zhongshan County Wartime Food Committee yesterday sent five representatives, including Li Delian, Huang Jinzao, Liu Xutang, Li Xingjie, and He Lücong, to Hong Kong to discuss relief measures with the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. To this end, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a joint meeting of the board of directors, the price stabilization committee, and the disaster relief committee for 7:30 PM this evening (13th) to discuss fundamental and effective relief methods. Meanwhile, the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has also scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to address this issue. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Li Xingjie, a representative of Zhongshan County, to inquire about the local rice shortage and the relief measures planned for the future. Mr. Li provided the following information:</p>
<p>Li Xingjie Discusses the Causes of the Rice Shortage</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li, Zhongshan County usually produces enough rice to be self-sufficient, with a surplus for export to neighboring areas. On average, the annual yield can meet the county's needs for two years. Under normal circumstances, a rice shortage should not occur. The reason for the current rice shortage is that a certain large rice company has been buying massive quantities of rice, estimated at four to five million dan, whenever new rice comes on the market and prices are low, and then exporting it to Macau. At the same time, neighboring counties such as Xunde and Xinhui, which do not produce enough rice for their own needs, also absorb a significant amount from Zhongshan. Due to this large-scale export and consumption by neighboring counties, the rice supply in Zhongshan County has become scarce. Furthermore, [omission] aircraft have been bombing various areas of the county, and rice merchants fear that their rice granaries may be burned down, resulting in total losses, so they dare not store large quantities of rice.</p>
<p>Nanfan Nine Counties All Report Grain Shortage</p>
<p>Now that rice storage is scarce, and the import tax on foreign rice is high, the price of domestic rice has risen opportunistically, and rice merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. The rice shortage is getting worse day by day, and the suffering is evident. Currently, in the Shiqi area, one yuan of national currency can only buy five catties of rice, and one hundred catties of grain also cost twelve yuan in paper money. This situation is not unique to Zhongshan County; nine counties, including Nanfan, Shunde, Xintai, Kaiping, and Enping, are experiencing the same difficulties. Moreover, the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee stopped working when Guangzhou fell, and there was no way to regulate the food supply. The former county magistrate requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt taxes on imported foreign rice and to organize price stabilization and establish a price stabilization committee to start relief efforts. Because there is a Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce established in Hong Kong, the local authorities sent five of us to Hong Kong to consult on relief efforts, hoping that our fellow villagers in Hong Kong would consider their hometown's plight and provide as much assistance as possible. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce has agreed to convene a joint meeting to discuss the import of rice into the mainland and organize price stabilization to help the people.</p>
<p>Representatives Return to Macau to Seek Advice</p>
<p>To this end, representative Li Delian returned to Macau this morning (yesterday) to inquire about the amount of rice needed locally and the methods to be used, so that he can provide opinions based on the information obtained at the joint meeting. Representative Li is scheduled to return to Hong Kong tomorrow (today) to attend the joint meeting. The detailed plan will only be announced after the results of tonight's (today's) discussion. Mr. Li also said that Zhongshan's rice production has always been considered abundant, but now there is a feeling of rice shortage. The plight of neighboring counties that do not produce enough food for themselves must be even more dire. Originally, organizing price stabilization in conjunction with the nine counties would be a smooth and effective approach, but the quantity needed or the relief methods needed are different in each region, so it has not been possible to reach a consensus. Only Zhongshan County has sent us brothers to Hong Kong first to request relief, and so on. The reporter then asked about the recent situation in Shiqi and other places in Zhongshan. According to reports, no [omission] aircraft have been seen in the county since the Lunar New Year's Day. Most of those who fled to Hong Kong and Macau some time ago have returned to the mainland because the cost of living is too high.</p>

<h3>After [Omission]'s Invasion of South China, Hong Kong's Trade with China Suffers Unprecedented Blow, Plummeting to Just Over 23 Million Yuan in January This Year; The Bleak Situation Has Not Been Seen Since 1925</h3>
<p>Last year, Hong Kong's trade figures totaled 113,071,214 yuan, of which trade with China accounted for 46,399,816 yuan, approximately 41 percent of the total. The monthly average was approximately 38,665,985 yuan. However, in January of this year, Hong Kong's trade with China plummeted to 23,816,362 yuan, a reduction of 15 million yuan. This phenomenon did not start this year, but began to decline in October of last year. The following is a list of Hong Kong's monthly trade figures with China last year:</p>
<p>January: 36,317,463 yuan</p>
<p>February: 32,421,618 yuan</p>
<p>March: 96,098,206 yuan</p>
<p>April: 52,103,987 yuan</p>
<p>May: 47,085,749 yuan</p>
<p>June: 36,330,223 yuan</p>
<p>July: 32,467,020 yuan</p>
<p>August: 34,511,954 yuan</p>
<p>September: 46,508,660 yuan</p>
<p>October: 118,365,569 yuan</p>
<p>November: 37,287,371 yuan</p>
<p>December: 23,479,895 yuan</p>
<p>According to the table above, the average monthly value is 38,665,985 yuan. The average for the first nine months is 41,690,998 yuan, while the average for the last three months is 29,710,945 yuan. The reduction in the last quarter was indeed due to the impact of the [omission] army's invasion of South China, with October and December being particularly severe. Although November showed a slight recovery, this was due to the large-scale export of Chinese tea through Hong Kong. The following is an analysis of Hong Kong's trade with North China, Central China, and South China:</p>
<p>Total for the Year</p>
<p>North China: 78,133,726 yuan</p>
<p>Central China: 40,645,127 yuan</p>
<p>South China: 245,212,963 yuan</p>
<p>Monthly Average</p>
<p>North China: 34,844,477 yuan</p>
<p>Central China: 3,387,094 yuan</p>
<p>South China: 20,434,414 yuan</p>
<p>Judging from the above figures, both North China and Central China have declined compared to the average since October. Only North China showed a slight recovery in November due to tea exports, while Central China also showed a significant increase this year. Since October of last year, Hong Kong's trade with South China has plummeted, especially in January of this year. The bleak situation has not been seen since the great strike of 1925. The reduction in Hong Kong's trade with China is mainly due to the invasion of South China by [omission], followed by the [omission] blockade of the Pearl River, which has had a significant impact. South China is the most important part of Hong Kong's trade with China. Unless the Pearl River is fully opened, it will be difficult to restore the previous prosperity. In the year before Guangzhou was captured, Hong Kong became the center of Chinese trade due to its special environment. The import and export of goods from Central and North China were all transported through the Kowloon-Canton and Canton-Hankou railways. Therefore, the main products of Central and North China were all concentrated in Hong Kong. Tea, in particular, accounted for an important part of Hong Kong's trade last year. The total value of tea imports last year was 16,926,951 yuan, and the total value of exports was 16,808,814 yuan, of which 9 million yuan was transported to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. Since the successive loss of Guangzhou and Hankou, the traffic on the Canton-Hankou Railway has been cut off. Hong Kong, which used to be a distribution center for Chinese goods, no longer exists. Although trade with North China can still reach the standard, it will inevitably decline gradually. There is no doubt about this. Because the [omission] army is blockading the Chinese coast, the center of Chinese trade will inevitably shift to Hanoi and Burma. Secondly, [omission] are implementing their economic aggression policy in North and Central China, and are controlling foreign exchange and all trade. This has dealt a major blow to Hong Kong's trade with China. Therefore, the future of Hong Kong's trade with China is of great concern.</p>

<h3>Shijian Middle School Scheduled to Start Classes</h3>
<p>Due to various reasons, National Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou was unable to move the affiliated middle school to Yunnan with the university, and has decided to temporarily suspend operations. In order to continue their studies, the students of the affiliated middle school held a meeting and decided to attend classes at the Hong Kong campus of Shijian Middle School. Shijian Middle School has formulated detailed plans to accommodate as many students from the affiliated middle school and displaced youths from the war zone as possible. The principal of the school, Xiao Junying, and the director of academic affairs, Guan Zhaopeng (former director of affairs and librarian of the affiliated middle school of Zhongda), are actively preparing to start classes on the 16th of this month. It is reported that the school has hired many former teachers from the affiliated middle school, and student registration is also very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Air Force Reserve Directly Under the Hong Kong Government; To Be Trained at the Far East Aviation School; Can Depart to Fight When Necessary</h3>
<p>The world war situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. To cope with this dangerous situation, the British government authorities have formed an Air Force 500 squadron to implement a plan to protect the colonies. Singapore and other places have already started recruiting air force reserves to join the air force when necessary. The Hong Kong government has also announced the recruitment of air force reserves to comply with this plan. After the above news was released, Hong Kong air force personnel were extremely active. According to the instructions of the British Air Ministry, the recruitment of applicants for training will be carried out. In the future, after being formed into an elite force, they will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong government to assist in air defense, and will be able to fight independently even in times of emergency. It is understood that this batch of air force reserves will be trained at the Far East Aviation School at Kai Tak Airport. Under the guidance of active air force officers, they will be taught various piloting and combat skills. The training aircraft used will be small aircraft and monoplane fighters, which will be shipped to Hong Kong from England. Pilots who apply for training must pass a physical examination by a medical officer, and must be approved by the British authorities after graduation before they can become official air force reserves. The uniforms and badges to be used in the future will also be specially designed, and will be slightly different from those worn by the regular air force. After the successful training of this batch of talents, their ability will be sufficient to protect the British colonies when necessary, and they can depart to fight at any time after the government's recruitment announcement is issued.</p>

<h3>Dongjiang Becomes Tense Again; [Omission] Busily Deploys; Zengcheng [Omission] Attempts to Invade Longmen; [Omission] Increases in Wancheng and Also Show Signs of Restlessness; Our Troops Are All on High Alert</h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Express News] After the increase of [omission] troops in Zengcheng, the situation in the Dongjiang area, which had been easing for many days, has become tense again. However, large armies are gathering in Heyuan, Conghua, Longmen, and Boluo, with strong formations. It is still undecided whether [omission] will look north to attack Longmen, or invade Huizhou and Boluo to the east. Currently, the target of [omission]'s movements seems to be Longmen, attempting to advance north around the periphery. The Huizhou and Boluo areas are only intended to serve as a diversionary tactic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Movements of [Omission] Troops in Zengcheng</p>
<p>It is understood that the original [omission] troops stationed in Zengcheng were the Matsuda Unit. They have now been replaced by another [omission] unit (battalion number pending investigation). Since the 5th of this month, they have been moving along the Guang-Zeng Highway to Zengcheng, with the main force concentrated in Fuhe, and the rest distributed in various strongholds in Shiqiao, Zhucun, Luobotong, Shigang, Shinan, and Xintang. According to intelligence received by military agencies, there are now four to five thousand county troops from the Zengcheng county under [omission] control, with more than ten artillery pieces and thirty to forty tanks. In addition, cavalry and engineering units have been busy transporting along the Guang-Zeng Highway and the Zeng-Tan Highway in recent days. On the morning of the 9th, more than four hundred [omission] infantry and cavalrymen disturbed Zhengguo, attempting to test our strength. They were defeated by our defending troops. Although [omission] are planning to be restless, they still do not dare to act rashly in view of our strength. Our army is currently on high alert, ready to meet the challenge at any time.</p>
<p>[Omission] Plots Restlessness in the Wanlong Area</p>
<p>Ten days ago, most of the [omission] troops stationed in the strongholds of Shilong, Wancheng, and Taiping in Dongguan County were withdrawn. However, since the 7th of this month, more than a thousand [omission] troops have returned to Shilong, and [omission] have also increased in Taiping and Wancheng at the same time. According to intelligence, there are currently more than a thousand [omission] troops in Shilong, most of whom are stationed in the town, and another three to four hundred are stationed at the railway station. [Omission] plan to destroy Shilong Nanbian and the iron bridge, and transport the iron materials back to [omission] country. Currently, [omission] have built a pontoon bridge in Heshang, which can be connected to the Wanlong Highway, but only [omission] soldiers and cavalry can pass, not vehicles. In recent days, [omission] have been transporting large quantities of military supplies from Taiping along the Gongfeng road through Wancheng and the Shilong Railway Station, and along the Dongjiang River to Shilong town. Therefore, there are currently thirty to forty civilian ships and speedboats used by [omission] moored on the Shilong River. There are currently about five hundred [omission] troops stationed in the Wancheng area and about one thousand in Taiping, but there have been no significant movements. In summary, the [omission] troops in various strongholds in Dongjiang have been busy deploying in recent days, and seem to be planning to be restless, waiting for an opportunity to move. The commanders of the Third and Fourth Guerrilla Districts have been ordered to strictly defend against this.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Xijiang Prepares for Counter-Offensive; [Omission] Requests Reinforcements to Defend Sanshui; Deng Longguang Personally Inspects the Front Lines of Xijiang; Our [Omission] Forward Soldiers Do Not Make Contact</h3>
<p>[Special News from Hekou] Recently, fresh troops have been successively dispatched to the upper reaches of the Xijiang River, heading to the front lines of Mafang, Xiaobao, Jinli, Guanghe, and Beishui to prepare for a counter-offensive in a hurry. The front-line commander, General Deng Longguang, personally inspected the defense of Xijiang, and stepped up arrangements. The [omission] chieftain Gangtian's division stationed in Sanshui has detected our army's enhanced forward deployments and is panicking, repeatedly telegraphing the [omission] headquarters in Guangzhou to request that additional troops be sent to the Sanshui Hekou area. On the 2nd of this month, An Teng, the [omission] chieftain in Guangzhou, dispatched six to seven hundred infantry and artillery from the Zhudu area, who departed from Shiwitang by train and headed to the Sanshui Hekou area. There are a total of twelve field guns, twenty-two light machine guns, and forty to fifty military technicians. In addition, the detective chief Lin Qian was sent to Hekou to preside over intelligence work, and a long wooden bridge was built in front of the Hekou Customs, directly into the river, for mooring transport ships. Recently, artillery positions have been set up at Shipaigang and Dianxian, with two cannon installed in each location. In the Jiaowei area, more than a hundred workers are building fortifications every day, only two thousand meters away from our forward sentry line. [Omission] and our forward sentries occasionally use machine guns to scan and guard, but the [omission] army's attitude is only to defend firmly and dare not advance towards our positions.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Our Guerrilla Force Attacks the Zhengjin Bank; Guerrilla Force Attacks with Machine Guns and Grenades; Obtains Two Million Military Tickets; [Omission] Feared and Dared Not Resist</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post published on the 10th that the Guangzhou branch of the Zhengjin Bank had been robbed and lost 200,000 Japanese yen. On the afternoon of the 11th, the "Hong Kong Daily" run by the Japanese in Hong Kong accused the report of being a rumor and slander, and malicious propaganda. The newspaper also said, "According to the Zhengjin Bank authorities, the matter is completely fictitious and not worth laughing at." Now, the Dalu News Agency has confirmed with a special quick message from its correspondent stationed in Weizhou that the robbery of the Zhengjin Bank did indeed occur. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forcibly Occupies Communications Bank Site</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Zhengjin Bank, which was originally established in Shameen, was closed down early after the outbreak of the war. When Guangzhou fell, [omission] forcibly occupied the old site of the Communications Bank on the lower floor of the Baigong Hotel on Taiping South Road, changed the two characters for "Communications" to "Zhengjin", and kept the two characters for "Bank". Personnel were sent to work, and [omission] military tickets were issued by the bank to absorb our national currency. The exchange rate between military tickets and our currency and paper money was also forcibly designated by the bank, with the purpose of destroying our finances. Therefore, there were many military tickets stored in the bank.</p>
<p>Heroes in Disguise Force Their Way in with Weapons</p>
<p>Our guerrilla force learned that the bank was a [omission] financial institution and decided to attack it. At the time, the First District Special Operations Team and the Guangzhou Guerrilla Force selected brave volunteers, totaling more than one hundred people. They first blended into the urban area, and arrived on Taiping South Road at the appointed time on the 8th of this month in groups. Each person wore plain clothes and carried grenades and pistols. In addition, they carried more than twenty machine guns hidden in bamboo baskets, pretending to be hawkers. At a signal, they drew their weapons, roared and demonstrated, and immediately rushed into the Zhengjin Bank. At that time, in addition to the bank's employees, there were also many [omission] soldiers guarding the bank. Seeing the large number of our team members, they dared not resist. The team members took the opportunity to obtain a large number of military tickets, with a total face value of more than two million yuan. After succeeding, they immediately withdrew. The [omission] army could not come to the rescue in time, and our entire team withdrew from the urban area without losing a single person. It was found that when attacking the bank, except for dozens of warning shots, grenades and machine guns were never used, which shows how easy it was to succeed.</p>
<p>[Omission] Military Ticket Value Plummets</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the [omission] ordered the puppet maintenance committee to try its best to cover it up, but the facts were all there and were known to many people. Therefore, the value of [omission] military tickets was greatly affected at the time. Although the Zhengjin Bank had fixed the ratio of military tickets to our national currency at 1.0 and to paper money at 0.8, the value of military tickets has now fallen sharply, which is corroborating evidence that a large number of military tickets were indeed seized. The [omission] mouthpiece is trying to obliterate the truth, but its efforts are doomed to failure.</p>
<h3>Statistics on [Omission] Aircraft Indiscriminate Bombing of Shaoguan in the Past Two Months</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Communication] Yesterday, the police authorities released news that Shaoguan is located in the north of Guangdong Province and has the Yuehan Railway passing through it, making it the military and political center of Guangdong Province. Therefore, [omission] aircraft frequently fly over and bomb indiscriminately. In the past two months, it has been bombed indiscriminately by [omission] aircraft thirty-one times, dropping a total of 994 bombs of various sizes. More than 700 civilians have been killed or injured, and more than 730 houses, shops, and public buildings have been bombed. In December of last year, there were a total of 65 air raid alerts, averaging twice a day. Now, because of the enemy aircraft's abuse, daytime business for citizens has mostly stopped, and it has been changed to nighttime.</p>
<h3>Obituary: The Passing of Industrialist Zhang Tuian, Memorial Service Held Yesterday in Shanghai by Various Circles</h3>
<p>The industrialist Zhang Tuian of Nantong passed away on January 26th at his residence in Shanghai. Various industrial companies, educational and charitable organizations in northern Jiangsu specially convened a memorial service for him at the Jade Buddha Temple Auditorium on Gordon Road on March 12th (yesterday). Mr. Zhang, whose given name was Cha and courtesy name was Shuyan, was a native of Nantong. His family were farmers. His father, Pengnian, was a man of hidden virtue. In his youth, he and his younger brother Qianan studied at the Xiting Kan Clan School and both showed remarkable talent. His brother faced litigation due to academic status, draining their family resources. Zhang stopped his studies and returned home to support his parents, allowing his brother to focus on his studies. Later, he became a guest in the secretariat of Wu Zhuang in Korea. At that time, the eastern conflict was budding, and he proposed three policies to consolidate the border. Unfortunately, Wu Zhuang died of illness before they could be implemented. Recommended for the position of magistrate, he was assigned to Jiangxi and successively served as magistrate of Guixi, Yichun, and Dongxiang counties. He cared for the people, observed officials, and was well-reputed wherever he went. He skillfully resolved disputes related to missionary cases, ensuring stability and peace. He also widely promoted education to enlighten the people, which was particularly commendable. Senior officials recommended him for outstanding performance, and he was expected to be greatly used after passing the probationary period as a circuit intendant. However, he, concerned about the daily decline of national affairs and believing that only self-governance could save the nation, resigned from office and returned to Nantong with his brother Qianan to promote self-governance, starting with industry, then education, transportation, water conservancy, and improving the local landscape. Over thirty years, he gained fame both at home and abroad. All his plans had their own origins. Although views may differ between the past and present, his spirit remains undiminished. The main aspects of Nantong's self-governance were recorded in great detail by Zhang Jiuzi in his "Nine Records," which need not be discussed here. However, all of it was undeniably the result of the efforts of the Zhang brothers. All profits were used for local development, with investments totaling several million. The textile and land reclamation industries were the most profitable, plugging loopholes, gathering labor, developing land, and enriching the people's lives. This surpassed all other industries such as flour, cotton oil, shipping, and iron smelting. Mr. Zhang wrote in his family instructions that without Tuian, the younger brother's ventures would be weakly established, and without the elder brother, Qianan's ability to maintain would be insufficient. They relied on each other, and no other brothers could compare. He served as head of the county's chamber of commerce, farmers' association, and water conservancy association for over a decade, making appropriate changes and improvements. Nantong bordered the river and sea, and was connected by the Grand Canal. Farmland depended on water for its life, so water conservancy was especially important. He built over a dozen sluices and culverts, constructed over forty li of embankments, and dredged the Ronggang River, doing it repeatedly. Whenever there were floods, he would use every effort to mitigate the damage, bringing it to a level state. Heaven could not determine abundance or scarcity; this was unique to self-governance. Mr. Zhang was honest and decisive, taking on difficult tasks without complaint. His early methods were also broad and strong, reflecting his character. In the past decade, he resided in Shanghai, daily writing scriptures and chanting Buddha's name, avoiding worldly affairs. However, he still continued his charitable work, providing assistance. He fell ill last summer, and his condition worsened by the end of winter. He died at 10 PM on January 26th of this year, at the age of eighty-eight. His will stipulated that no announcement be made and no gifts be accepted.</p>
<h3>Special Shipping Dispatch</h3>
<p>The American steamer "Aornos" arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Xiaoluzong. It is confirmed that this ship was originally the "Bu Dielu Da" of the former Yi Ri Yi Tai Company, which used to operate between Zhaojiang and Haikou. After the shipowner, Mr. Peng, transferred it, the shipping route was changed. Recently, the Taifeng Company purchased it for over 200,000 yuan for routes to Zhaojiang, Guangzhou Bay, and Haiphong. It is rumored that the ship's name may be changed back to "New Bu Dielu Da."</p>
<p>The "Darnien," agented by Doolittle &amp; Morrison, was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday morning. However, due to heavy fog in the harbor, the ship was delayed and arrived late last night. It is scheduled to depart for Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Italian postal cargo ship "Gedina Su" is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow and will be anchored in the central harbor. It is reported that the ship carries approximately 1,600 tons of cargo, including over 900 tons of Saigon rice.</p>
<p>The "Jinshan" of the Guangdong, Hong Kong &amp; Macau Steamboat Company is scheduled to depart for Guangzhou at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning and return to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM on the 16th. All procedures will be the same as the last trip to Guangdong.</p>
<p>The "Jiang Ma" of the Xijiang Navigation Company has been stationed in Hong Kong for a long time. Recently, the ship has joined the Hong Kong-Macau route, departing for Macau at 4:00 PM every day and returning to Hong Kong at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The "Franconia" of the White Star Line departed from Wuyu yesterday, embarking on its eleventh world tour. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this month. Due to the impact of the war, the ship will not stop at Japan and Shanghai, but will instead go to Xiaoluzong, Java, and then Wuyu. This time, it carries approximately 100 tourists. Jardine Matheson is the agent in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Movies and Drama</p>
<h3>Movie Stars After Marriage—Male Stars Often Suffer a Decline in Reputation—</h3>
<p>For the time being, no one in Hollywood seems to be calling Clark Gable "Mr. Carole Lombard" or Robert Taylor "Mr. Barbara Stanwyck." The reason is simple: these two couples have not yet married.</p>
<p>This kind of title is a great insult to the husband. However, Hollywood people do not care about these formalities. Sometimes, the husband has an even higher position and salary than his wife on the screen. However, as long as he marries a female star, contrary to the usual title of "Mrs. So-and-so," he becomes "Mr. So-and-so." Moreover, naturally, his position gradually declines, while his wife's position gradually rises. No matter how glorious a movie star he was before marriage, he is often overshadowed by his wife's brilliance and becomes unknown.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what makes Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck delay marriage—although not entirely for this reason, it is at least one of the main reasons. Often, the female star, because she loves her partner too much, is unwilling to see him go down this path of decline, just as Carole Lombard did not want to see Gable suffer the same fate as her ex-husband William Powell, and Barbara Stanwyck was unwilling to let Robert Taylor follow in the footsteps of Frank Fay.</p>
<p>In the past, these two female stars had tried hard to help their husbands maintain their positions on the screen, but it didn't work. Frank Fay left the film industry, and William Powell was always unhappy until his film "The Thin Man" appeared.</p>
<p>Looking at the movie stars in sweet married life now, Joan Blondell and Dick Powell are the best example. True, their life is happy, but Dick Powell's screen reputation has stopped improving. On the contrary, Joan Blondell, as a mother, is leaping forward by leaps and bounds. Before marriage, Dick's position was far ahead of Joan's. Now, their box office appeal is almost equal. What is the reason for this? Does marriage in Hollywood have such a special impact?</p>
<p>Generally, after a male star marries a female star, it is obvious that he is in a supporting role. Being ridiculed as "Mr. So-and-so" is not a very serious matter. What directly affects his film career is that a large portion of his original fan base is diverted to his wife.</p>
<p>If this is the case, a large group of his audience is lost. Once the news of his marriage is announced, his fans will go to see his new wife's next film. This is purely out of curiosity, to see what kind of woman this is who married "their star." In this way, at least temporarily, this part of the audience becomes fans of his wife. Female fans watch her films to find out what kind of beautiful woman can win the heart of this male star. Male fans think that if he didn't choose anyone else and chose her as his wife, she must be an amazing woman. These two psychologies constitute the main factors that are beneficial to the female star.</p>
<p>Film companies also find that the female star's box office appeal suddenly increases—although sometimes it is only temporary, effective for two or three films after marriage—so they sign contracts, increase salaries, choose good directors for her, and select better stories to use as scripts for her next film, and she truly becomes popular.</p>
<p>At the same time, after two movie stars get married, just because she is a woman, nine out of ten publicity efforts are focused on her, especially her photos that appear in newspapers, magazines, shop windows, and in front of theaters, leaving a deeper impression of her appearance and figure in the minds of the audience than that of the unfortunate male star.</p>
<p>The husband is unlucky. He doesn't get as many acting opportunities as before, and he is at a disadvantage in terms of publicity. What is worse is that the editors of magazines who are familiar with the psychology of the audience often replace the male star's photos with his wife's photos when they use the male star in the magazine. "Use his wife's photos. His fans also prefer to see her photos." That's it. This male star will never have a chance to show his face.</p>
<p>Only those photos of the two of them together in public places can be printed in newspapers. At least the editors are too embarrassed to cut him—this cumbersome object—out. But in those photos, he is just shrinking back as a moving background, dimly lit and extremely ugly, which has a great impact on the box office of the film. Sometimes, with his wife's help, they stand side by side facing the photographer. However, the photographer slightly changes the position, and the female star wearing light-colored clothes is two feet closer to the flash bulb. Just two feet makes a big difference. When the photo is printed, the female star's face is radiant, while he has a gloomy face, as if he is recovering from a long illness, faintly visible in the darkness. Naturally, female stars often take publicity photos, hairstyles, clothing, photos, etc. They also often teach the audience how to apply makeup and how to show beauty. These are more attractive to female audiences. As for male stars, who pays attention to their tuxedos or bow ties?</p>
<p>Enough, no more reasons. Looking at the history of Hollywood in the past, perhaps there is more evidence. When Franchot Tone married Joan Crawford, he was a rising star. After marriage, his career stalled. He stayed at home, drawing books, and then divorced. He went to England to rebuild his reputation and returned to Hollywood to continue his career. At that time, Joan Crawford had married Frank Fay. The decline in the new husband's reputation forced him to turn to the stage.</p>
<p>A better example is Lew Ayres, who is returning to the screen. When he married Lola Lane, he was a first-class star. However, we haven't heard of him since. After his divorce from Lola Lane, he had a good film that could have saved his reputation. Unfortunately, he made a big mistake and married Ginger Rogers again, repeating the same thing, declining in reputation, and then divorcing. After the divorce, he is now on the road to success again.</p>
<p>Others, Claudette Colbert and Norman Foster, Alice Faye and Tony Martin, Jeanette MacDonald and Gene Raymond, cannot escape this formula. Only Ann Sothern and John Payne are exceptions, one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>Clark Gable is afraid that he will soon become "Mr. Carole Lombard." To prevent him from escaping this formula, we really don't want to lose such a good actor.</p>
<h3>Silver Flower</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Luise Rainer, although she did not win the Academy Award for acting this time, she has won the honor of the star with the most plane trips this year. Last year, she traveled between New York and Hollywood a total of forty times, breaking the unprecedented record. The most interesting time, she suddenly had a whim late at night and had to rush to New York the next day. She hurriedly put on a negligee, covered it with a sable coat, and boarded the plane. Her last trip to New York was to reconcile with her husband, screenwriter Clifford Odets. Hopefully, she will achieve her goal on this trip.</p>
<p>Walter Winchell said in the newspaper that there is a somewhat unstable situation between Gene Raymond and Jeanette MacDonald. However, judging from the current situation, it does not seem to be the case, because they are still using the same publicist. According to Hollywood's convention, if a couple wants to break up, they should each use a separate publicist for publicity before consulting a lawyer to counter each other.</p>
<p>Gene does often go out alone to watch boxing matches, and occasionally attends banquets alone. However, these are "husbandly habits" and are not surprising. But then again, if there really is a rift between them, we wouldn't know.</p>

<h3>Dissection of the Situation in Dongjiang</h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>It is possible that the × people will re-invade Dongjiang and attack Huibo again, but to think that the × people have already begun to harass Dongjiang is a hasty and simplistic observation.</p>
<p>On the surface, the actions of the × people in Dongting in the past half month do seem like a tense situation, like the harassment of Longhua and Weining in Boluo, the raids of Paize in Zengcheng, the invasion of Zhangmutou in the Huiguan border area, and the increased mobilization of × troops in Zengcheng and Shilong. The tense state is like an arrow on the string, ready to be launched. Coupled with the threat of × planes shaking the sky, bombing Boluo today, bombing San'ao tomorrow, and then bombing Huiyang heavily, and the warships outside Daya Bay patrolling back and forth, the tension has risen even higher. Therefore, Hong Kong and Macau are vying to spread news about how the × people are mobilizing and fighting. In fact, this is entirely a cunning trick of the × to make the false seem real.</p>
<p>Based on concrete facts observed in recent days, the × people have absolutely no intention of invading Dongjiang. The abandonment of this intention, as the reporter said in the previous dispatch, is due to "lack of strength" rather than "willingness of heart." The weakness of the × people's military strength on the Dongjiang front has been explained many times since September. According to recent intelligence, Zengcheng has only 400 troops, Shilong has only over a hundred, Dongguan has only 300, and Shawan has more, about nearly a thousand. These are not enough to cause concern. However, due to the weakness of their military strength, the × people are internally panicked and afraid of our army's attack. They have to deliberately mystify, set up suspicious arrays, and try to cover up. First, they use defense as offense, attacking from Zengcheng and Shilong in different directions, targeting the counties of Zeng, Hui, Bo, Dong, and Bao. However, after investigation, the troops harassing Zhangmutou and the troops harassing Longhua and Changning are from the same unit, secretly and cunningly transferring the only one thousand troops to two places. Second, they take the troops that should be reinforcing the Southern Islands through Shilong and Dongguan to the sea, thereby expanding the Dongjiang's momentum and preventing our army's rapid advance. Third, they use the air force and navy to disrupt the Dongjiang inland and coastal areas, attracting our army's attention and relaxing our offensive. Fourth, they send a large number of spies to Dongjiang to spread absurd news and promote a policy of appeasement. Therefore, the villages in Dongjiang are all spreading rumors of × army invading the east and finding many × people's propaganda materials, letters of advocacy for peace, and strange leaflets. However, most of these propaganda materials are dropped by × planes at night.</p>
<p>However, the more the × people conceal their secrets, the more it reflects their weak military strength and internal panic. We are taking advantage of the × people's weakness and launching a heroic offensive posture. In recent days, every night, × planes have been flying to various parts of Dongjiang one after another to侦察 our army's movements. Before the counter-offensive, the × people are so flustered and helpless that they have no time to take care of themselves, let alone the strength to invade.</p>
<p>The military aspect of our army's counter-offensive is secret and difficult to describe in detail. Generally, the counties of Hui, Zhuan, Bao, and Dong are still designated as guerrilla areas. The main force's positional warfare will be launched between Longmen and Conghua. The people's armed self-defense groups and the regular troops responsible for guerrilla tasks are appropriately coordinated and distributed in various bases on the front line of the lower reaches of the Dongjiang.</p>
<p>The × people's ambition is to advance along the Dongjiang again to prevent our army's deployments from approaching. It seems that our estimations of the × people's invasion routes and military strength are all beyond the × people's ability to solve in the current environment. First, going upstream along the river, the fragile motorboats cannot operate alone, and the Dongjiang is currently dry and blocked, making it impossible to advance. Second, taking the old route from the sea, the current Huaihai and Lufeng guerrilla areas are not where our main force is located, so there is no need to adopt this. Third, going from Guangzhou to Shenzhen via the Guangjiu Road and detouring to Huibao, the route is too long and the military strength is too large. The gains and losses of this area of Huibao's coast have no major impact on our military. Fourth, attacking Hui, Bo, and Heyuan along the Huiguang Highway is undoubtedly what the × have always dreamed of. Assuming they can succeed, the minimum estimated strength to hold it is that the Huihzhou city and the surrounding area require 800 troops, Boluo requires 500, Heyuan requires 2,000, the traffic line requires 2,000 in Bogeng, 3,000 in Bohe, and 7-800 in Bohui, for a total of about 9,000 troops. Today, when the × people are trapped in a quagmire on Hainan Island, where will they find a batch of troops? In general, the × people have abandoned the offensive and are taking a defensive posture. Today is the time when the × people are agonizing and helpless.</p>
<p>During the × people's period of depression, they may dare to launch another adventure, concentrating light cavalry to launch short-term disturbances on the upper reaches of the Dongjiang, but the area of assistance must not dare to cross the Tiejiang by waterway, the Guanghui Road must not dare to reach Xinzhaotang, the Huizhang Road must not dare to cross Zhangmutou, and the sea must not dare to land to twenty li, because the × people's troop allocation is depleted and it is difficult to obtain reinforcements. They are deeply afraid of our army's ambush and annihilation.</p>
<p>By thoroughly dissecting the × situation, we can understand the battle situation in Ranjiang. First, the initiative is with us. Only we attack the ×, and the × have no strength to attack us. Second, in order to remedy the weakness of their meager military strength, the × people will actively use traitor activities, light cavalry "sweeping", and intimidating conspiracy of aircraft and ships, and buying out bandits, disrupting from it.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's First Division Football League: Eastern Soundly Defeats St. Joseph's; St. Joseph's Lacks a Good Goalkeeper, Xia Xian Takes Over</h3>
<p>In yesterday's First Division Football League match, Eastern played against St. Joseph's at the Hong Kong Football Club ground. Hou Chengtong and Hua Guoxiu were resting, and Yu Qia and Xu Buyun went on the front line. St. Joseph's was also missing players and surprisingly used Xia Xian, who was not used to goalkeeping, as the goalkeeper. Eastern took advantage of this weakness and scored five goals, defeating their opponents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was still poor, with frequent showers. The soldiers fighting on the sandy field felt that the road to Shu was difficult to travel. If they were not careful, they would become a mess. In this situation, there was no excitement to speak of. If it weren't for Cao Baoyun's affectation and Xia Xian's great convenience, there would have been some gimmicks, but otherwise it was boring.</p>
<p>Ten minutes into the match, the short-legged tiger Shi Du got the ball on the right and lobbed it high. Deqi headed forward to shoot, but Ma Shaner was unable to block it. Xia Xian was unable to save it, and the record was broken (1-0). After 21 minutes, Shi Zan bravely advanced with the ball and passed it to Qixiang. Qia Xing received Qixiang's pass and quickly crossed it. Xia Xian was out of touch with the times and tried to intercept it, but Li Si swept the ball in and it went into the empty goal, making it 2-0. Not long after, the half-time whistle blew. Changing sides to fight again, Eastern still occupied the upper hand. After 18 minutes, Shi Du robbed Ellins of the ball and passed it to Lingsheng. Lingsheng lobbed it from the center of the field. Xia Xian jumped high to catch it, but missed it. The ball hit the top of the goalpost and bounced off Xia Xian's shoulder. Xia Xian accidentally pushed the ball into the net, scoring an "own goal." The spectators burst into laughter (3-0). After 30 minutes, Eastern besieged St. Joseph's. Bing Tu passed the ball along the right side of the goal. Qia Xing arrived in time and flicked it into the net (4-0). After 32 minutes, Bing Tu received assistance from the left and made a contribution, making it 5-0. Eastern won a big victory.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball Game: First Division Chung Sing vs. South China; Two Second Division Games Also Held</h3>
<p>The Men's Open Tournament organized by the Hong Kong Basketball Association stopped all games yesterday because it was the anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen. According to the schedule, there is one First Division game and two Second Division games tonight. In the First Division, Chung Sing will play against South China. The former was the runner-up of the last tournament. In past competitions, they often competed with the Zhongqing team. The team has famous athletes Zhang Rensheng and Chen Ruzheng. The South China team also occupies a considerable position in the Hong Kong basketball circle. Players Xiao Jiemin and Lu Enjing are also masters. Therefore, this game tonight will be a brilliant competition. As for the Second Division, one game is between Reporter vs. Li Xing. Reporter is known to be good amongst Second Division teams and Li Xing were the champions of the last summer's Meidu Cup. This game has a lot of potential. But Reporter's Mao Ziming, Chen Baoqi, and Ma Zhaohua were penalized and suspended from playing for a year and a half or a year by the previous committee members. It is difficult for the Reporter's Association to appeal, but the case has not been decided yet. Therefore, the strength of the team will be affected tonight if these players cannot play. The remaining Second Division game is between Dazhong and Chuncao. The two teams have not appeared in the Hong Kong basketball world, so it is impossible to speculate about their strength. The lists of the two First Division teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Chung Sing Team</p>
<p>Su Bohui, Ren Jiexing, Guan Yunshu, Zhang Rensheng, Guo Zhihong, Zhong Foqiang, Li Yuanfen, Chen Ruzheng</p>

<h3>Six Tennis Matches Today, To Be Held If It Doesn't Rain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Continuous heavy rains are disheartening, significantly dampening the enthusiasm for sporting events. This afternoon at 4 PM, if the weather clears up and offers some convenience, the Open Grass Court Tennis Tournament will feature four singles matches and two doubles matches at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. However, the weather is gloomy, and even if it clears, the ground will be damp. Therefore, it is feared that today's tennis matches will not proceed as scheduled. The order of play is recorded below:</p>
<p>Singles</p>
<p>Yu Peter vs. Tio Bob</p>
<p>Peng Aishuang vs. Coro Fu</p>
<p>Li Huitang vs. Liang Bingzhao</p>
<p>Olin Zhen vs. Yiling Tu</p>
<p>Doubles</p>
<p>Gao Shannu &amp; Lei Miti vs. Hong Hui &amp; Fencha</p>
<p>Xu Weipei &amp; Xu Runpei vs. Olin Zhen &amp; Xia Xian</p>
<h3>Classroom Games and Gymnastics Teaching Materials (1)</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Comrades, spring has arrived! In this precious and limited space of Hong Kong, the continuous rain during springtime presents the greatest challenge to our physical education comrades. In ordinary schools, it is already extremely fortunate to have a space the size of a gladiatorial arena, let alone an expensive covered playground (gymnasium). Therefore, the continuous spring rain is like adding a lock to the hands of our physical education comrades (a situation where heroes have no place to use their skills). This truly leaves us unable to apply our expertise. This is especially difficult for comrades coming from the mainland because the environment on the mainland is fundamentally different from that of Hong Kong – the mainland has vast spaces, spacious campuses, and places to read books and newspapers. Even without a covered playground, there is at least a spacious auditorium that can be used for physical education classes. With such a good environment, whether it is a physical education class or a lecture, no problems will arise. However, the situation in Hong Kong is not the same. Most schools are crowded with many people and limited space. Not only is there no gymnasium, but it is also difficult to find spare spaces or relatively spacious libraries. Therefore, whenever it rains, it inevitably puts physical education teachers in a difficult and helpless situation – they want to teach, but there is no suitable place; they want to cancel the class, but they cannot, cannot! Cancelling classes will inevitably affect the peace of the school and disrupt the lectures of other classes. Since they cannot teach on the playground, there is no gymnasium, and they cannot cancel the class, how should they solve this problem? Should they have the students sit blankly in the classroom or tell stories? Stories may work for young students in lower grades, but what about older students (junior and senior high school students)? This will inevitably become a problem. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the problem, we can only implement classroom games and gymnastics. However, there is also a significant problem in implementing this type of gymnastics.

<h3>Tomorrow's Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>Wind and Rain Sentimental Indeed</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch) The previous afternoon, a lively scene unfolded at So Kon Po, where South China Southern District and Eastern played in the special Silver Shield Football Semi-Final. As the battle began, a light rain fell, but it quickly stopped. As the battle was about to end, wind and rain suddenly arrived. After a brief clearing, one could see that the Old Man (Heaven) is not without sentiment. If it had rained during the game, it would have been a major disappointment.</p>
<p>Counting the Dogwoods, One Man Short</p>
<p>War drums frequently urged, and the two armies moved together. In the South China Southern District lineup, counting the dogwoods, one man was missing. Liu Qingcai's foot injury had not healed, and he was temporarily unable to take to the field, greatly worrying General Mo. After much planning, it was decided that Guo Yingqi would play right winger. This was an occasional exercise of power, but it was unexpected that Yingqi would perform well in every aspect. General Mo indeed made appropriate adjustments.</p>
<p>Mike's Suspenseful Heart</p>
<p>When the Eastern players appeared, a burst of applause suddenly arose from the open-air bleachers on the north side. When the South China Southern District players took the field, a wave of response also surged from the covered bleachers. From this, it can be seen that the pro-Eastern and pro-South China factions each occupied one side. After the battle, a spectator in the north bleachers suddenly set off firecrackers, unclear whether it was to congratulate South China Southern District on their victory or to mourn Eastern's loss.</p>
<p>A Foreigner's Words Pierce the Heart</p>
<p>Beside me, a foreigner, sitting with his wife, often saw invasive fouls during the first half of the game, causing referee Mr. Omar to frequently blow his whistle to signal penalties. Fortunately, he handled it well. Seeing this situation, the foreigner suddenly muttered to himself, "Is that a game or a referee whistling performance?" These humorous words pierced my heart.</p>
<p>Obstacles Removed, Heart Still Unsatisfied</p>
<p>According to the open-air bleachers on the east side of So Kon Po Stadium, as the season was about to end, the bamboo structures that had previously blocked the view of the mountain in the distance for the common fans were dismantled. Therefore, on this day, the common football fans, high above, could see everything clearly. As the game was about to end, one common fan descended the mountain and attempted to climb into the bleachers to "add oil." He was spotted by the soldiers patrolling the field, who chased him, causing a burst of uproar.</p>
<p>Branch Transport</p>
<p>Liu Pohan and the current China Times sports reporter Lai Duanfu were "old companions on the football field, fond of casual chats." After the game, Xianhan walked to his old companion, who said, "You were just too unlucky today." In fact, these words were just to comfort Xianhan. Eastern's defeat was not entirely due to bad luck, but to being less skilled. (Broken Army)</p>
<h3>The Importance of Legs</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuezheng</p>
<p>Vigorous leg exercises can not only directly develop the muscles of the back but also greatly benefit the waist and abdomen, as well as the internal organs, especially the circulatory and respiratory systems. Although other exercises can also activate these two systems and improve the function of various organs, their effectiveness is far below that of vigorous leg exercises.</p>
<p>To enlarge the chest and develop it to its most perfect state, one must also perform vigorous leg exercises because this type of exercise stimulates the lungs, allowing them to absorb a large amount of air.</p>
<p>However, vigorous leg exercises are not suitable for people with heart disease. Even healthy people should not overexert themselves when performing this type of exercise because it has a significant impact on the heart and lungs. It should be known that not only the heart and lungs, but any organ can suffer significant damage if it works too hard.</p>
<p>What we are now going to discuss is the deep knee bend exercise. This exercise is both an easy leg exercise and a vigorous leg exercise. In other words, it can both promote metabolism, activate the circulatory system, and make the leg muscle fibers grow, develop muscles, and strengthen the endurance and ability of the legs. In addition, it is also very effective for developing the muscles of the back, waist, and abdomen.</p>
<p>The method of the "deep knee bend" exercise is also very simple. Simply try to squat down as much as possible and then stand up straight. This exercise can have a significant impact on the heart and lungs. The method of breathing is also very important. If the breathing is incorrect, these two organs can also suffer significant damage. The method of breathing is to exhale when squatting down and inhale when standing up. The breathing should be deep and slow.</p>
<p>The most important thing when performing this exercise is to gradually increase the weight and have a certain system. We can follow the following procedure:</p>
<p>(1) Keep both feet parallel and separate them by about eight inches to the left and right. Then, squat down as much as possible until the arms are parallel with the thighs, and then stand up straight. The heels must not be lifted. Do this fifteen times. The movements should be slow. After finishing, rest for a while and take deep breaths for about one minute.</p>
<p>(2) Keep both feet in a figure-eight shape, with the heels together. First, lift the heels up as high as possible (inhale), then bend the knees and squat down (exhale) until the buttocks are parallel with the feet, and then stand up straight (inhale). After standing up straight, put the heels down (exhale). Do this fifteen times. This exercise is also beneficial for the muscles of the thighs. After finishing, also take deep breaths for about one minute.</p>
<p>(3) Same as (1), but when exercising, place a weight (Bas dtll) or a sandbag, dumbbells, or other equipment equal to the body weight behind the neck and on the shoulders. Alternatively, you can do without equipment and have someone ride on your shoulders, but their weight should be close to your body weight. Pay attention to maintaining a straight waist and back posture, and do not hunch your back. If you feel difficulty breathing or palpitations during the exercise, you can pause for a moment when standing up straight and take two or three more breaths, and you can also inhale through your mouth. Do this fifteen to twenty times. People with weak physical strength or an unhealthy heart can reduce the weight on their shoulders to about half of their body weight, and the number of times can also be reduced to ten or fifteen times.</p>
<p>After the exercise, take deep breaths for about three minutes. If you still have energy, you can repeat it again, but the number of exercises can be reduced by five times. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>"True Villain" vs. "Hypocrite"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunfeng</p>
<p>Reading Mirror, Volume 8, quotes Yang Yongxiu as saying:</p>
<p>"The foolishness, ignorance, weakness of a ruler is not enough to destroy his country. The country is destroyed by a rigid, intelligent ruler. In a family, an unworthy son is not enough to break the family. The family is broken by a frivolous, undisciplined person. In a minister, a true villain is not enough to disrupt the country. The country is disrupted by a hypocrite." This says that a "true villain" is more forgivable than a "hypocrite." In fact, this is deduced from a relativistic point of view.</p>
<p>Bai Letian once used a poem to illustrate the importance of the two: "A fox pretending to be a woman harms less, deceiving people's eyes for a day and a night; a woman who is a fox harms more, deceiving people's hearts day and night." It seems that a fox pretending to be a woman to seduce and harm people is not deeply harmful. In fact, whether it is a fox-woman or a woman-fox, they should all be swept away.</p>
<p>Presumably, the ancients believed that the reason why a true villain is not harmful is entirely due to the clear discernment of the public. They believed that with the eyes of the public watching and the hands of the public pointing, they are carefully guarding against "villains." Of course, villains cannot use their skills freely and can only hide their tracks and run away with their tails between their legs. Therefore, the saying that "true villains" are not harmful is only established. But sometimes it is not so easy because if someone is qualified to be a true villain, they may have the methods of a true villain, covering people's ears and eyes. For example, today, Wang Zhaoming, who is hiding in Hanoi, just as after the loss of the Northeast, Wang sang "Unite as one, and face the national crisis together." In fact, he did not face the national crisis. Then, when Rehe was lost and Tianjin and Beijing were shaken, Wang sang "Negotiate on the one hand, resist on the other hand." But there was no resistance, and no negotiation either. If there was, it was probably a secret agreement. Finally, he sang the "Doctrine of Bleeding to the End" and the absurd saying of perishing together with Japan. When he was in a high position in the country, posing and shouting resistance, yelling "the final moment."</p>
<p>Today, in the anti-Japanese war camp, there is no room for any "true villain" or "hypocrite." We should always examine ourselves. The Bible has a saying of removing evildoers like sifting tares. Today's ×××× should also be like this. What is the sieve for sifting tares? That is the eyes, thoughts, and hands of 450 million people.</p>

<h3>Romance of Hong Xiuquan (Vernacular National Novel)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiao</p>
<p>Romance of Hong Xiuquan, Second Collection, Twenty-Ninth Chapter, a stone print edition in the collection of Peking University, written by Huang Xiaopei of Panyu. The first part contains a preface by Zhang Binglin in Wu Nei (Guangxu Thirty-Second Year), and also a self-preface, titled "Huangdi Era Four Thousand Six Hundred and Sixth Year," which shows that the original twenty-nine chapters were written in the first year of Xuantong, only two years before the Wuchang Uprising. Zhang Binglin was also a strong advocate of revolution, so the national consciousness of this book is undoubtedly correct. I remember when the Republic of China was founded, I was in Wuhu, and I was only ten years old at the time. I saw a kind of oblong, glossy paper book popular on the streets, with a fake Western-style binding, which is now the popular paperback. The opposite page was green tissue paper, with the three words "Hong Xiuquan" written in large characters at the top, drawn in three circles, printed in black. In addition to the words, there was also a line drawing of a circle below. Each book was thin, with twenty or thirty pages, and it seemed that there were at least the first and second collections.</p>
<p>However, the current popular version, renamed "The Heroic Biography of Hong Yang," has been increased to 140 chapters, extending the original book fourfold. I think the 111 chapters added later, from the 55th chapter onwards, should be added by the die-hard Qing loyalists. For example, the title of the 78th chapter is "The Rebel Hong and his Ministers All Died, and the Brothers of the Zeng Family All Received Grace." This is a very glaring wording—Hong Xiuquan is called a rebel, and Zeng Guofan and others are called recipients of grace. It can truly be said to be inverting black and white. After reading it, I feel that even the writing in the first 54 chapters is better. For example, the writing of Li Xiucheng's tactics is extremely clever and interesting. It also has a scholarly air. For example, in the 30th chapter, "Shi Dakai Retires Zeng Guofan with Poetry," the original letter and five original poems by Shi Dakai are used. This is comparable to the poems of famous people added by Mao Zonggang in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A Ying's Qing Dynasty Novel History says: "Huang Xiaopei's Romance of Hong Xiuquan, regrettably ended abruptly at the 54th chapter, and the publication period was after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown."</p>
<p>A detailed examination of this novel would not only be impossible due to space limitations, but I also do not have such leisure and ability. Presumably, Jian Youwen and Xie Xingyao are the most capable because they are both experts in the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Jian Youwen has written "Miscellaneous Notes on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and Xie Xingyao has written "Discussions on Historical Events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Other reference materials include Li Xiucheng's confession, Shi Dakai's diary, a collection of poems and essays from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Interesting Documents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (edited by Liu Fu), Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Historical Anecdotes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc. There are truly countless things to count, and they can at least consume several years of a researcher's time. In terms of creation, in addition to the Romance of Hong Xiuquan, the modern Chen Baichen is fond of taking material from this. I once introduced him to see the two experts, Jian and Xie. His "Jin Tian Village," also named "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," has been successful on the stage. "The Death of Shi Dakai" does not seem to have been staged, perhaps because the atmosphere of tragedy is too heavy, which does not conform to the current era of active resistance? Films and Peking operas have also used the historical events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as themes. I hope that there will be an opportunity for detailed research in the future.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the Journey</h3>
<p>— Hu Weizhou</p>
<p>White egrets were singing in the clear sky in the method of the old calendar. The troops had to linger in the camp for a whole day. Our 1,300 good men were so exhausted that some of them fell asleep wherever they lay down. I remember that the troops had just arrived here at three o'clock in the morning, and I could vaguely hear the lazy mountain gun sounds in the distance. Lao Chen and I, hungry, drank the west wind, and the situation seemed very awkward. We wanted a civilian to find some food for us. Fortunately, we ran into a local rogue. Naturally, a robber would pretend to be a scholar in front of a judge. He finally led us to a dilapidated house with a smile and a strange politeness, saying that it was his home. He then called out to an old woman to cook rice and boil tea, and he went to kill a duckling. He talked and talked, and insisted on asking us for two yuan in legal tender. Afterwards, we returned to the original place, and fell asleep on the stone steps with our clothes on, feeling at ease.</p>
<p>The next evening, we continued our journey. We turned from the narrow path of Mouchang onto the wide highway; but the artillery fire was still densely surrounding the entire silent mountain valley.</p>
<p>"Platoon Leader He, do you hear the artillery fire?... If your wife were here at this moment, she would definitely stop you and say: 'You can't go...' "</p>
<p>"Damn you—bookworm—always the same old thing, I'll beat you—"</p>
<p>"Didn't she argue with you fiercely in front of the regiment's office yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Um—a soldier with his wife by his side never has anything good..."</p>
<p>In this way, the sergeant clerk was satisfied, and his steps stepped out a victorious and arrogant tune.</p>
<p>The troops advanced eastward along the highway, about to reach and Lu, when suddenly a chaotic sound came through. We knew that at this time the villagers hated the darkness of the night, otherwise, in their houses, village streets, ponds, and fences, they could see the dust and sand flying all over the sky.</p>
<p>Footsteps, cart sounds, the scolding of women and children, and the neighing of horses, countless, tense noises, and long breaths on the pulse of the highway. Of course, the situation had never been like this before. The dogs, who usually adhered to the altar, barked wildly as if they had never done so before.</p>
<p>The sounds became more and more loud, so loud that they swallowed all the silence of this late autumn night. The eyes of some travelers—no, the firebirds of the refugees—shot out angry and fierce looks at the guys in our way.</p>
<p>Was this a refugee crossing the border? But in the meantime, it was clear that there were artillery carts and herds of horses. Was this a march? How could it be mixed with the cries and curses of women and children? This is... This is chaos, tension, sharpness, noise, crying curses... converged into a raging torrent, a flood:</p>
<p>Oh! This sound is our anti-Japanese army in a hurried march, infiltrated by thousands of clueless refugees coming from the opposite direction, who did not even believe in their dreams that their hometown would suddenly become a slaughterhouse. Their desperate, fleeing, chaotic sound, this sound filled with terror, misery, and trembling breath, swept over from that side, and was about to sweep to another place—the night wind blew through the wailing of × military field guns, our team Liu crossed a slope and bridge, and then advanced bravely on the plains.</p>
<h3>On [Cold] and [Hot]</h3>
<p>— Tie Niu</p>
<p>"Cold" and "hot" are two absolutely opposite adjectives. In general, what kind of standards are required to accurately match their literal identities? The answer is: "Cold and hot are standards obtained through comparison."</p>
<p>Here we can distinguish the routes of "cold" and "hot": enthusiasm and coldness, hot-bloodedness and cold-bloodedness, fanaticism and calmness, liveliness and desolation. If we use "life" as an analogy, then, roughly speaking, childhood is enthusiastic about "games" and cold about "romance," adolescence is enthusiastic about "romance" and cold about "games," middle age is enthusiastic about "fame and fortune" and cold about "romance," and old age is enthusiastic about "comfort and enjoyment" and indifferent to games, romance, and fame and fortune.</p>
<p>What China needs now is to hold ardent emotions and a crimson heart, bravely shedding fresh, hot blood, and dedicating everything to the youth in the War of Resistance. What China does not need is cold-heartedness. "Heat expands and cold contracts" is a law of physics, but in China, it has lost half of its effect. Today, when the flames of the War of Resistance have been ignited in every corner of China, the people in the rear, no matter how severe and cold the weather is, their enthusiasm for serving their country is at its highest point. The displaced refugees, devastated by the artillery fire of the × people, are not wearing cotton-padded clothes and are being attacked by the piercing north wind, but they can instead encourage the force of resistance.</p>
<p>For example, on the front lines: fighting bloody battles in the frozen, snowy ground, no matter how cold the weather is, the hearts of the brave men who share the same hatred and fight heroically against the enemy are boiling with hot blood.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to be "hot," but being too hot can sometimes cause "cold." If you feel hot and sweating profusely, or cold and shivering with your upper and lower teeth chattering, then this "sudden cold and hot" and "unstable cold and heat" can determine that you have contracted "cold and heat sickness" and need to urgently ask a doctor for diagnosis. Take a few "quinine pills" to drive the "malaria bacteria" out of the country.</p>
<p>Similarly, a certain country needs a military that is both enthusiastic and brave, and politicians who are level-headed. They have close links with each other; otherwise, they lose the balance and harmony of "cold" and "hot." If it gets hot, the military will charge around wildly; if it gets cold, the brave men will be so cold that they become "war-weary" and "hang themselves." Such "sudden hot and cold" and "unstable cold and heat" will create the country's "cold and heat sickness." But this cannot be solved by simply asking a quack doctor for a diagnosis; it requires the people of the country suffering from "cold and heat sickness" to deeply realize that their country is terminally ill. If they do not urgently rise up to save it, they will inevitably perish together. Then, the people should unite with the masses oppressed by the warlords, raise the hall of resistance, and eliminate the fascist malaria bacteria—the warlords—completely.</p>
<h3>The Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>As he approached the gate of a courtyard, he stopped and identified it: the high courtyard walls and the sturdy iron gate gave him an impression like a prison. In between, a stray dog ​​escaping the cold passed behind him, accidentally brushed against him, and then he felt humiliated, blushed, calmed himself, and immediately raised his head again, making his steps particularly neat, so that the snow under his boots sounded a kind of proud snow sound - walking mechanically toward that small door.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper had to ask the person entering; this had become a habit for him. However, the tone of his inquiry was determined by the entrant's dress and expression; some were humble, some were high-pressure. When he asked the entrant this time, his tone naturally belonged to the former. However, the answer he got was:</p>
<p>"Bastard, I come here every day, don't you recognize me?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I remembered as soon as I heard your voice! Yes, you come here every day. Alas, my eyes are really going blind!"</p>
<p>However, he knew that he was deceiving himself; but he had to apologize, shrink back, and let the master's noble and arrogant guest pass by.</p>
<p>This guest still lingered, expressing his dissatisfaction, and said in a reproachful tone:</p>
<p>"From now on, you must recognize me next time!"</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he left. Then, he turned back and saw the gatekeeper walking into the gatehouse. He said silently:</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, I am doing this so that it will be more convenient when I leave." He also thought: "If you knew who I was, you would definitely not let me pass. If you find out who I am now, you will definitely lock the door, then..." (5)</p>
