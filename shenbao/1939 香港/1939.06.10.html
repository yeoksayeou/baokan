<h3>粵贛邊區的綏靖工作</h3>
<p>— 鐃燄</p>
<p>（一）改編了將成××的別偅隊</p>
<p>（本報東綫特約通訊）閩粵贛邊區緩靖公署的設立，主要的原因便是贛南別働隊的禍患已蔓延日廣，牠的勢力已擴大到廣東之和平龍川境界來了，在綏署未設立前，別働隊的組織巳經擴大將近萬人左右，定甫，龍南兩縣的縣長經巳給牠驅逐出境。贛南十數縣份，政府的政令在鄉村無法推行，他們以『反對征兵』『反對上前線，『江西人保衛江西』，的口號作號召，許多民衆受騙參加，在各縣境界設卡濫抽捐稅，冒名抽收自銜經費。</p>
<p>別働隊是什麽東西呢？牠們在贛南便是×匪所領導下的武裝組織，去年廣州的救亡日報，曾經登載過兩篇通訊。專門叙述贛南×匪的活動情形。當時別動隊的人數不過千人以上，領袖陳×，曾經做過××的排長，後來報變了××的。他是×匪頭目，抗戰開始後，他是任瑞金保安連連長，在×××叛變後不久，他發動了瑞金的暴動，刦持了行政專員及縣長，經過談判，爭得了別動隊的名義，在一個時期內，成爲公開的×匪武裝組織，他公開向民衆號召：來參加別動隊的可免兵役，但要自己携槍械來，因此，專門在地方上做土皇帝的土豪劣紳便大批大批的參加別働隊，同時，確也有許多純潔無知的民衆，以爲這就是與過去××一樣的東西，便也不斷湧進去，於是，別動隊便迅速的擴大到驚人的程度了，</p>
<p>就當這別動隊萬分囂張的時候，張代司令長官委第九集團軍總司令吳其偉將軍爲閩粵贛邊區綏靖主任，在××縣設署辦公，吳主任對於別動隊的政策主要的還是先從政治上去爭取他們，不得巳時，才用別的辦法。</p>
<p>由於別働隊是各地方獨立發展，雖有系統的領導形式，却不能由一紙命令把他們集中起來統一指揮，因此，吳主任只動用了一旅的兵力，沒上一個月的工夫，便基本解决了這一嚴重的問題。定南龍南一帶的爲政已恢復了常態，大部分別働隊均經集中改編成一個第×預備師，師長由吳主任的參謀長兼任，還再編成了一個挺進隊，現在積極訓鍊中，在吳總司令領導下，將來必然成爲强有力的反攻部隊，在中日戰爭史上，創造出奇蹟來的。</p>
<p>雖然極少部份的百數十人還沒有消滅，最近已竄到安遠龍川邊境，這甕中之　，早晚總得肅淸的。×匪的眞面目，邊區一帶的民衆，比前巳有更進一步的認識。和平，在縣長與黨部領導之下，曾經舉行過反×匪漢奸運動。（當別動隊侵入和平活動時）數月之前，民衆只是驅逐他們。自從綏署設立，布告取締非法武裝之後，別働隊進入和境的活動人物，和平民衆已經不客氣地把他們逮捕起來送交縣府轉送綏署法辦了。這是說明看：民衆的覺悟程度已經提高了，在軍隊與民衆親密的合作下，×匪漢奸是必然會被肅淸的。</p>
<p>（二）解決了和平彭寨進行了三年的「黃葉械鬥」</p>
<p>由於一個堪輿先生的挑撥，說黃姓的水陂有碍葉姓的祠堂，而釀成了拆築水陂問題的兩姓械鬥，械鬥開始至今已及三年，中問曾有過許多調解，事本早經解决，不幸又于×××××××，××私吞賠款（前任）××歪曲判斷（判斷黃姓水陂在離葉姓祠堂三百餘丈的地方建築，要使灌溉十餘畝田之水實行倒流）這鬥爭便一直延長下來。今年舊暦年初一起雙方再起劇烈的械鬥，自從在城黃姓的一條船被葉姓公開劫掠及船主被捕之後，械鬥之勢，復日益擴大，彭寨本身的械鬥地點前後已達二十餘里，而所有葉黃兩姓鄰居的鄉村，均已準備着和醖釀着械鬥。葉姓方面遠有鄰縣的埃人赶來參加，如果這鬥爭再不解决，由彭寨而擴大及全縣時，則必然迅速的擴大到龍川去，因爲，在他們看來，好像是歷史上註定了的，經過了若干時間之後，就應當鬬一次的。</p>
<p>記者從老隆步行赴和平，四月廿五日上午經過彭寨，記者似乎很幸運而實際上是不幸的看到了他們最後一仗的無理智的鬬爭，因爲大路上已成爲戰場，我是由一位本地同胞引導一條小路，登山跋嶺而過，在山巔，看見他們戰鬬方憩，濃姻密佈，檢聲是若斷若續的，士炮聲『隆隆然』好像×人的小鋼炮一樣，把整個空間罩上了一層恐怖的陰影。雙方的戰鬥員是看不見的，被烟霧所籠罩，但原始式的號角聲『布——布——布，布，布，』聽起來確有點使人胆寒，喊殺的聲音可不大明晣的聽到。記者禁不住仰天長歎！同胞們這種英勇好鬥不怕犧牲的精神，爲什麽不好好用在偉大的抗×戰場上，而來作這種延長將及三年的毫無理智的自相殘殺呢！</p>
<p>冒着一個下午的大雨，晚上七點才到達和平城，寄宿於同鄉店中，許多同鄉在此做生理，同鄉會會長又是『先父」世交，當晚便去拜訪了他，才知道卽日下午，張代司令長官和吳總司令曾到和平來，各界代表前往歡迎，只停三個多鐘頭便囘車往潮汕視察防務去了，我的運氣真是太不凑巧，早至一天的話，不是同時可以碰到兩大巨頭麼？</p>
<p>當我提到械鬥事件時，他們告訴我，下午張代司令長官，很認眞的詢問這件事情，並責壽縣長爲什麽不能把這案件早早解决，他嚴厲地說：『如果還不聽候解决，把他們屋都燒完，中國不需要這一批愚民！』</p>
<p>吳主任已調了兩連人來，馬上開往彭寨執行彈壓的任務，並留下一位年靑英勇的薛旅長及吳主任的隨身的張秘書共同負責進行解决這械鬥事件。由於我與張秘書同鄉的關係，對這案件處理的經過始末，它的困難情形，它的發展情形，他所提出的解决草案，以及它的結果，我都很淸楚。</p>
<p>案己經結束了，除了葉黃兩姓都各自澳悔之外，全縣民衆都完全擁護判决的正確，茲將大概情形略述如下，</p>
<p>（一）水陂問題，葉姓無理，這是關係國計民生的，黃姓必須建築，但建築地點，離入舊陂二十五丈之地。</p>
<p>（二）械鬥問題，黃姓先開始殺　姓神士三人而起，黃姓罰款八千元，葉姓罰款五千元，兩方互殺人命，互相賠償，先殺者賠撫卹費六百元，報復者賠撫卹費五百元。</p>
<p>（三）爲永息雙方械鬥起見，雙方大刀繳交政府，雙方繳械各一百五十枝，，雙方各送出壯丁八十名，所有殺人兇手在內，經訓練後，調赴前綫抗日，（由雙方當事人具結担保壯丁不逃跑。）</p>
<p>（四）葉姓毆打政警，罰款二千元</p>
<p>（五）所有罰款，由縣府黨部救亡團體，縣立學校派出代表組織保管委員會保管之。罰款之分配：補撥黃家損失二千元，補發葉家損失一千元。辦救亡幹部訓練班一千元，和平日報五百元，餘多補助及開辦普及敎育經費之用。（這罰欵之分配，須經緩署審核批准之後，始准動用）</p>
<p>（六）刧船案件，當作土匪案辦理，與械鬥無關。（當記者離和平時，已槍决了一人，據說，還有好幾個要槍决的。）</p>
<p>（七）附件一宗：限三日內將過去所欠扯兵名額及地稅等，一併繳交淸楚。</p>
<p>組看起來，似乎這些條件相當苛刻，其實並不苛刻，他們有的是祖嘗的錢，他們到外面去請族人及親戚來幫手，他們的壯丁集中着像上戰場的軍隊一樣，就是完全動用這些錢的·至於檢呢，有的是祖上製的，有的是紳士們私製的，繳交出來，毫無問題。而且，政府不是沒收他們的槍，而是由政府保管，如果冬防需要，或要打日本的游擊時，由紳士們具呈領取，政府還可以按照實際需要撥還給他們。</p>
<p>還有一些零星事件值得紀述的，當雙方所有關係人物都齊集縣府聽候審問時，薛旅長先開審土匪案件，馬上將爲首的那一個綁赴刑場槍斃，（同時他又是械鬥主角之一）嚇得那般紳士個個面如土色，略經問話後薛旅長宣佈判詞全文，每一條問　方紳士們：「答應麼」「答應」「可以做到麼」「可以做到，」（草案條件是壯丁一百名槍三百枝）『限七日之內辦妥可以？』『可以！』當時的情景是，除了「槍斃」之外，差不多什麽條件都可以答應。以後雙方人物共同合照相一張，再各拘留下十位主要人物，共同關在一個大房子裏，晚上，張秘書到那房裏去看他們時，他們之間好像巳完全忘記了那三年來决鬥的伉恨，却在那兒互相商量，如何聯合請求減輕條件。張秘書立卽乘這個機會，進行他那政治的敎育！</p>
<p>三年來的械鬥中，雙方死亡數目到底有多少，雙方都不肯說，只有做俘虜被殺的大家才公開，因爲多殺死對方一個人，就表示了他的一分勝利，他們誰也不肯認輸的，正因爲如此，雙方的壯丁戰死之後，險由祖產津貼撫卹外，死者的家屬是不準掛孝也不準啼哭的，不聲不響的把他埋掉就算了。如果　洩漏了消息，或者因爲他的家屬哀號痛哭而使對方曉得了，那就是犯罪，這個罪是要『剝奪生命』來處罰的。</p>
<p>張秘書告訴我：當案了結時，還要把他們雙方紳士及所有主要人物。很莊重的到閻王爺面前，立下誓詞：『如雙方冉有械鬥事情，子孫絕滅』還請些各穢關要人去監誓，他們是最怕發誓賭咒的，對　般封建殘餘人物，這樣做還是很有　用的。</p>
<p>和平械鬥的風氣是很盛行的，所有人的批評，這一次的解決辦法，是最正當最澈底和最週到的了。</p>
<p>（三）傖斃定南大土劣黃巨川</p>
<p>黃巨川定南縣人（與和平毗連屬江西最南之一縣）一個秀才出身，在定南是一個土覇王，他有一部分武裝力量，便不顧國家法令，胡作在爲，濫收捐稅，魚肉平民，這傢伙就是在械鬥案的同一時間內被捕了的。</p>
<p>張代司令長官經過定南時，得悉了這件事情，馬上要吳主任下手令槍斃，吳主任做事一向是非常認眞的，手令固然叫秘書寫好，却並未發下去執行，只囑咐秘書及於長審問淸楚之後，再行執法，這期間，他們又到和平來辦葉黃械鬥案件了。而黃巨川也有相當廣大的神通，讬入設法營救，居然也就有×機關要求移犯，為薛長所拒絕。</p>
<p>據說。張司令長官對土豪劣紳貪官污吏是最深惡痛絕的。當他到梅縣時，就問吳主任：那位黃巨川，槍斃了沒有？要吳主任發電來問，吳主任明知道還沒有槍斃，在司令長官催促之下，便發了一個電報到和平來，呌張秘書伴同薛旅長前往會審黃巨川，如證據　實，卽行就地槍决。</p>
<p>接電報之第二天，便是黃葉案初次會審，他們便决定會審完畢之後，馬上到定南去，但當第二天正午十二點鐘的時候，總司令部一位副官到來，又携來吳主任手令一張：「不必提審，卽行就地槍决。」原來那位副官從汕頭乘車來和平，途中與司令長官車相遇，車停後司令長官又問吳主任：「黃巨川的事情解决沒有？」吳主任說：「提審之後便搶斃的。」司令長官性急地說：「不必再這一套，這般混蛋，檢斃就是。」於是，吳主任便又下了這麽一個手令。</p>
<p>那天下午四點鐘，槍决了那士匪案姓葉的，五點鐘時候，一輛專車載薛旅長向定南出發，晚上七點鐘，槍决黃巨川的消息，便從電話綫中傳到和平來了。</p>
<p>一個最高司令長官，能够這樣關心增方事件，能這樣嚴厲地去處理貪污土劣問題，這是值得我們讚揚與愛護的。如薛旅長張秘書等，能這樣週密的澈底的合理的去解决地方上的積弊，忠實的厲行上級給予他的任務，這更值得所有軍政人員地方官吏認眞倣效與學習的！</p>
<p>廣東的政治固然有了新曙光，然而，黑暗面實在太大了。廣東民衆大部份還在慘淡的陰影裏生活着。光明在前，還只是可望而不可卽。在這大×當前的今日，固然須要廣大民衆在『抗日第一』的立場上去努力奮鬥，去找尋光明的出路，但刷新政治機構，全國厲行的國民精神總動員，首先要求一切政府人員起模範作用，這一切在今天還是迫切需要的，因爲目前的行政機關，畢竟還是廣大民衆的推動機呵！</p>
<h3>中國高等教育設置現狀</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）中國高等敎育（包括大學與獨立畢院及專科學校）設置現狀，近由敎部調查統計甚詳，茲探錄於下：</p>
<p>戰前設置</p>
<p>淸末廢科舉興學校，其制度模仿東西各國，而取則於日本尤多。當時高等敎育機關，有大學堂，高等學堂，高等實業學堂，法政學堂，優級師範學堂等，課程以中學爲體，西學爲用，民國肇造，改訂學制系統，專門敎育，有大學，專門學校，各分預科本科，十一年學制改革，因有設置單科大學，高等師範改爲師範大學，大學及選用科制之規定，於是全國專門學校及高等師範學校，多紛紛改爲大學或師範大學，大學校數，一時驟增，學生畢業年限無形縮短，不免影響一部份學生之程度，至國府成立後，大學組織法，大學規稈專科學校組織法，及修正專科學校組織規程等，先後公布，十餘年來，全國專科以上學校之設置，均以此爲準則，迄於抗戰，而未有變更。</p>
<p>抗戰以前，全國專科以上學校，凡二百零八所，自學校之性質言之，可分爲大學，學院，及專科學校三種，大學共計四十二校（國立十六，省立七，私立十九）學院共計三十四校，（國立五，省立八，私立二十一）專科學校共計三十二校，（國立六，公立及省市立十六，私立十），比較觀之，大學最多，學院次之，專科學校最少。</p>
<p>自設立之性　言之、又可分爲國立、公立、省市立及私立四種，國立者共計二十七校，（大學十六、學院五，專科六）、公立者專科二校，（交通部設立之吳淞商船專科學校、與中央國術館設立之體育專科學校、均視同公立）、省市立者共計二十九校、（大學七，學院八，專科十四）、私立者共計五十校（大學十九、學院二十一，專科十），私立學校比國立或省市立者均多，然國省市皆係公立，若合併計算，共計五十八校，猶多於私立學校。</p>
<p>至其分布概况，亦可分爲北部，中部，東部，南部，及西北部五區，北部平，津，冀，晉，魯，各省市共計三十校，中部川，鄂，豫，湘，各省共計十七校，東部京，滬，江，浙，皖，贛，各省市共計四十五校，南部兩廣，閩，桂，滇，各省共計十三校，西北部陝，甘，新疆，各省共計三校，東部居第一位，北部居第二位，中部居第三位，南部居第四位，西北部比較最少，各區之中，上海獨有二十五校，北平有十四校，廣州有七校，南京有六校。</p>
<p>大抵抗戰前專科以上學校之設置，偏重於大學，而忽略於專科學校，大學方面，又多順其自然之發展，缺少整個之計劃，故多集中於少數都市。近年以來，雖有向邊遠省份發展之趨勢，然尙未達理想之目的，迄抗戰發生時，各省區未設專科以上學校者，除東三省外，猶有熱，察，綏，靑海，西康，寗夏，等省及蒙古西藏二區。</p>
<p>戰時遷移</p>
<p>自七七事變，教部為謀各級學校安全及保全固有設備起見，於戰事將爆發前，規定戰區學校處置辦法，分令各省市敎育廳局，及專科以上學校，斟酌情形，選擇比較安全之地區，以爲戰事發生或逼近時遷移之準備，其方式得以各校爲單位，或混合各校各年級學生統籌支配，暫行歸併，或暫行附設於他校，亦得暫行停閉。自平津失陷，滬戰繼起，京，滬。江·浙一帶，大都淪爲戰區，除租界內之少數學校而外，凡逼近戰區者，均紛紛從事　移。至徐州會戰而後，武漢與廣州同時告警，於是華中與華南之專科以上學校，亦不能維持課業而不得不作遷移之計。當時軍還浩繁，舟車缺乏，各校員生與其珍藏之設備無不轉移道路，歷盡艱辛，或遭遇意外之損失，然幸大都抵達安全地點，恢復課業，至其遷移之地域，近者或入租界，或遷鄰縣，遠者則深入內地，西北達陝甘，西南窮雲貴，中部溯江而上，至四川各地。昔日視爲交通不便高等敎育未發達地區，今皆成爲學府之林。此種專科以上學校大規模之遷移，雖爲不得已之。然對於內地各省社會文化演進之裨益則甚鉅，各校遷移情形如左。</p>
<p>（一）在本省境內遷移者，有國立西北聯合大學，（由北平大學，北平師範大學，及北洋工學院聯合設立），陝西省立醫學專科學校，國立厦門大學，國立湖南大學，河南省立河南大學，河南省立水利工程專科學校，福建省立醫學專科學校，私立福建協和學院，私立華南女子文理學院，私立福建學院，浙江省立醫藥專科學校，江西省立工業專科學校，江西省立醫學專科學校、湖北省立農業專科學校，廣東省立體育專科學校，廣東省立勷勤商學院，私立廣東國民大學，私立廣州大學，等十八校。</p>
<p>（二）遷入陝甘者，有私立川至醫學專科學校，（遷陝）私立焦作工學院（　甘）等二校。</p>
<p>（三）遷入雲貴廣西者，有國立西南聯合大學，（由北京大學，淸華大學，及南開大學聯合設立），國立同濟大學，國立中山大學，國立中正醫學院，（以上遷滇　國立江蘇醫學院，國立交通大學唐山工程學院，國立藝術專科學校，私立大夏大學，私立湘雅醫學院，（以上遷黔）國立浙江大學，國立國術體育專科學校，江蘇省立敎育學院，廣東省立敎育學院，私立武昌華中大學，私立無錫國學專修學核，（以上遷桂）等十五校。</p>
<p>（四）遷入湘川者，有國立中央大學，國立武漢大學，國立東北大學，國立藥學專科學校，私立牙醫專科學校，山東省立醫學專科學校，私立金陵大學，私立光華大學，私立復旦大學，私立武昌大學，私立齊魯大學，私立朝陽學院，私立金陵女子文理學院，私立　昌文華圖書館專科學校，私立武昌藝術專科學校，江蘇省立銀行專科學校，私立北平民國學院，等十七校，全國專科以上學校，除上述各校分別遷移本省及後方外，其遷至上海租界，有交通大學，曁南大學，上海商學院，音樂專科學校，與私立大同大學，滬江大學，東吳大學，上海法學院，持志學院，正風文學院，之江文理學院，南通學院，上海女子醫學院。同德醫學院，東南醫學院，東亞體育專科學院，上海美術專科學校，新華藝術專科學校。大　大學已遷貨州，在上海設分部，復旦大學已遷四川，在上海設立分部。光華大學遷入上海租界，在四川設分部，其入香港上課者有私立嶺南大學，廣東光華醫學院，及廣東國民大學與廣州大學之分敎處，總計因戰事影響而遷移者，凡七十七校，而停頓之學校不與焉。（停頓者凡十七校與遷移者合計爲九十四校，俱因戰事影響，不能在原地開學），其能照常上課者，僅有上海之國立醫學院，中法國立工學院，私立震旦大學，上海法政學院，北平之燕京大學，輔仁大學，中法大學，北平協和醫學院。鐵路專科學校與天津之私立工商學院等十校，非設校於租界，卽依賴於敎會，惟在川省之國立四川大學，省立重慶大學，四川敎育學院，私立華西協合大學，漢省之國立雲南大學，桂省之省立廣西大學，甘省之省立甘肅學院，新驅之省立新疆學院，湘省之私立　治農商專科學校，與新設之國立貴陽醫學院，師範學院，西北工學院，西北農學院，江西省立獸醫專科學校因原設後方，始終未遷，維持常態，然僅寥寥十餘校而已。</p>
<p>改併停頓</p>
<p>當平津失陷時，專科以上學校員生陸續爾下者達萬餘人，敎部因經費及設備關係，乃以國立北京大學淸華大學，與私立南開大學三校聯合爲國立長沙臨時大學，后更稱國立西南聯合大學。國立北平大學，北平師範大學，與北洋工學院三校聯合爲國立西安臨時大學，後改稱爲國立西北聯合大學，其后國　北平藝術專科學校與杭州藝術專科學校，先後　移，以其性質相同，亦令合組爲國立藝術專科學校，國立交通大學之唐山工程學院，與北平鐵道管理學院，當平津失陷後，曾一度停頓，不久，唐山工程學院遝湘複課，因將鐵道管理學院合俳辦理，及戰區擴大，各校內遷者，同一性質之學校，往往　集一地，而校舍設備，又多因　就簡，敎學效率難期增加，敎部爲調整院系，充實內容起見，二十七年度乃有國立西北工學院與西北農學院之設置，西北工學院，係以國立西北聯大之　學院，東北大學之工學院，與私立焦作工學院，合併改組而成，西北農學院，係以國立西北聯大之農學院，與西北農林專科學校，合併改組而成期能集中人力物力，以奠定西北工業之基礎，而為發展西北工農事業之先聲，又江蘇省立醫政學院，與私立南通學院之醫科，服務戰區，輾時入湘，共設備尚能保全，亦令合倂改組為國立江蘇醫學院，以應抗戰之重要，最近教部，因各醫學校院。大多集中於黔川等省，復訂定集中設置辦法，俾得涌力合作，增加敎育效能。至於雲南省立大學，亡十六年度。行政院卽有改爲國立之决議，二十七年度乃實行改組。中央國術館體育專科學校，原爲中央國術館所設立，亦同時改為國立，並更名為國立國府體育專科學校，直綠於教育部，此外廣東省政府，亦因經費緊縮，將省立勷勤大學之工學院，併入中山大學，而以商學院改爲省立　勤商學院，敎育學院改爲省立敎育學院，分別狥立設置。</p>
<p>以上爲專科以上各學校改組合併之情形，其因受戰事影響，權遇摧毀，或離遷移而無法維持，暫告停頓者，爲數亦復不少，如河北省立工學院，女子師範學院，醫學院，農學院，山西省立山西大學，工業專科學校，商業專科學校農業專科學校，山東省立鄉村建設學校，上海市立體育專科學校，北平市立體育專科學校，均告停頓。國立山東大學校遷萬縣後，因設備欠缺，遂暫行結東。安徽省立安徽大學遷抵沙市後，因經費困難，亦已停辦。吳淞商船專門學校，在滬戰初之起時以適當戰區，無法遷移，不久卽告結束，此外江蘇省立蠶絲專科學校，自蘇州失陷後，停頓年餘，雖有一部份學生在滬復課，一時尚無恢復學校之望。私立中國學院，雖仍在北平維持課業，但其詳情，尙須加以調杳。總計專科以上學校因抗戰而停頓者，凡十有六校，（大學三，學院四，專科八。情形不明者一），誠中國敎育史上空前之浩刧也。</p>
<h3>怎樣動員農村婦女？　戰時鄕村服務隊工作經驗（續）</h3>
<p>托兒所是非常簡單的，因爲隊員自已經費力量的薄弱，一切用品食物，盡能向地可方上富裕者捐募。較大的兒童，在托兒所內，也授以適當的敎育。每日晚間，在春耕的田間或工廠中工作完畢了的母親，們就將孩子們帶囘去住，每日早上將她們孩子交給托兒所。</p>
<p>有種托兒所是知時的，僅在晚上收容兒童，是專爲那識字班讀書的母親們而設的，因爲她們羅書的時候，必需將懷裏的兒童交給托兒所，在她們讀書完畢時冉把孩子帶囘。</p>
<p>各地托兒所收容兒童有自十餘人至四十人的，而以爲××工廠工人設的規模最大，收容兒童二百餘人，現已由工廠當局接收辦理，成績很好。</p>
<p>（六）隊員們的精神隊員，必須非常樸素，莊重，而費考慮的處理一切工作和環境，並且耐得艱苦。她們不隨便說笑，她們不隨便在鄉民家裏吃飯，受鄉民的饋贈。她們要奔走幾十里的山路和阡陌，不論是在雨中，同時，隨時不忘記她們的自我敎育，讀書報，開座談會並時時在檢討工作和生活。</p>
<p>她們的工作是獲到效果的，陳先生感歎似的說：倘然這工作在五年前就發動，那中國的農村『定及　動昌了』。每當她們離開某鄉鎭的時候，地方上大大小小都呼着要留住她們，</p>
<p>她們怕當　們離去時，在那兒曾下過的力量將成白費，所以一方面組織當地的工作幹部繼讀她們的工作，一方面過些時候去巡迴視察一次。</p>
<p>地方政府還不能給他們很好的協助，經濟困難，以及適用於鄉民唱歌的缺乏，報章，漫畫，照片等宣傳材料的不易到達鄉村，都是阻礙她們工作更好的發展的條件。（俊）　（完）</p>

<h3>普南前綫的經學會（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報山西戰地特約記者　金在镕</p>
<p>【紅學】是封建性而又很迷信的民衆自發組織，他們敬神時，誰也不得見，而每一個會員對于敬神的情形都也諱莫如深，不肯吿訴人。但在組織上巳沒有過去那種【大師兄』【一師兄】的封建味道了，現在都編成了隊，班，幷且也有童子班。</p>
<p>第二天的早員，我再去訪問距××　兩學的另一個『紅學』，那是××村，是這一帶編村的主村，離×人　地也有二里路右左，會長是一個不大　饒的老頭子，但很堅决。『　呀，這個時候不幹，就活不成了」；「沒有組織團體時，×人天天來，現在可不敢來了」；「我老了，但有我的兒子幹。我是無論如何不逃的。「這是他吿訴我的話，也足以代表不願做亡國奴的人們的呼聲。</p>
<p>至於武器，這里的「紅學」是很缺乏的，他們僅有矛子，大刀；××村僅有步槍九杅，手槍二杆，有些連一支槍也沒有。但是他們的抗日情緒是非常高漲的，不過，他們存在着如下的缺點：</p>
<p>第一，他們的組織，是民衆的自發組織，軍政的領導是不够的，他們沒有好好的軍事訓練，因此在作戰時表現出盲目的亂衝，同時政治的領導，可以說是沒有的，因此其抗日的情緒，恐不能保持其常性。第一，這些團體，是地主和農民在『保家鄉』之口號下的給合，因此沒有脫離狹隘的家族觀念，而抱　『人不犯我，我不犯人』之宗旨；第三，他們的意識是不正確的。他們都自信有『神」保護，其勇氣是寄托於「神』的身上的。例如二月三日的戰鬥，死傷了些人之後，他們都歸咎那些死傷者跑在『神旗』的前面，而忽略了沒有掩蔽的　鋒，和缺乏火器的不利條件；第四，農民的散沒性依然存在；第五，尙不知愛惜物力（如胡亂打槍之　）；第六，缺乏作戰的火器，僅有些「近戰」武器是不够的。</p>
<p>他們雖然是封建性的迷信組織，但是分佈在×人的側後方，是×人最致命的威脅。我們要極力去爭取他們不至于為×人的懷柔政策所同化。尤希望各駐軍當局，對一紅學」應採用正　的政策，那麽，爭取的工作才易于完成。</p>
<p>我順便在這里提出幾點爭取的方法，供大家參攷：</p>
<p>一，派遺政治幹部，加入該會，傳提高他們的抗日情緒，幷潛移默化其迷信觀念；二，盡可能予以物質的援助（特別是槍械彈藥，幷加强其軍事訓練，以克服農民的散沒性；三，促成各道門的大聯合，加强共團結，共同對付日本××主義。</p>
<p>希望關心　个問題的人們，提出更多更正確的意見，使「紅學」會日　加強，日漸積極，以增厚我們抗戰的力　。　民廿八，五，十六于茅　波</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>怎樣對付日本貨幣戰的進攻</h3>
<p>日本侵華的全面戰爭，最近的確帶上了一種特質，就是：因為軍事進攻的緩和而改用政治的及經濟的進攻。固然以前也曾經兼用過政治的及經濟的方策，但卻沒有最近的積極而顯明，特別是經濟的進政。最近幾個月來×國政府及輿論界卽熱烈討論法幣在我們抗戰上的强韌性及如何加以破壞的問題。其具體政策遂表現于最近對我法幣的進攻上。</p>
<p>最近因為×人貨幣政策的急攻和我們緊急的應付，致使法幣的黑市價格暴跌。很顯明的，這是由於×方搜集法幣以轉套我外滙及×人在上海運用政治手段使然的。據某方消息，最近×方確實運用九千多萬的法幣，以期達此目的。我們為應付此突來的襲擊起見，遂由香港外滙平衡基金委員會命令上海滙豐及渣打等銀行暫停出售照往日價格的外滙。在這鬥爭上，我們雖是出以應急的辦法，但是我們確實處於主動的地位。</p>
<p>對於這次日本貨幣政策的攻勢的應付，除政府已採用消極的辦法以外、我們還主張積極的辦法。茲略抒所見如下：</p>
<p>第一，法幣黑市的暴跌非自今日始，兩三個月來跌風就漸漸加劇：由四月的「五五·七八」（以每百值港幣計）跌至五月的「五四·六〇」，再跌至六月初旬的「五四·五一一」，昨午竟又跌至「四六·五〇」。這裏有近因還有遠因。積極的辦法就是去此遠因。所謂遠因大約可分為滬港游資之過多與對外貿易的衰退。前者因為我國游資隨失陷區之擴大而集中於滬港兩地，並有人作投機事業，釀成法幣在外滙上的過剩；後者則因我國產業之被破壞及資本之脫離生產事業，釀成輸出少而輸入多的現象，因而對於外匯的需要增加。故其積極防止的辦法，是獎勵及宣傳民族資本投於內地的生產事業上，旣可以消納游資，且可以增加輸出，減少輸人，可以說是一舉而三得。但是這種政策的執行上需要民族資本家與政府的切實合作。實則民族資本與其逃亡於滬港而受到這種匯價變化的危險，倒不如投投資於西南及西北的各種產業上較為安全而有利。</p>
<p>第二，抵制日本貨幣戰爭的進攻，還須依靠中英兩國的切實合作。日人時常宣傳今日法幣之所以强韌，大半是由於英國的支持，我們也不否認這種事實。但是我們還要促英國特別注意的，是：法幣的前途與英國的利益有莫大的關係，英國政府更應充分體會斯脫拉波基的一句話；「中國是在為英國而戰」。日本對華的貨幣戰，除運用經濟的手段之外，還運用「經濟外的」第略，卽政治的策略，例如封鎖上海物資的來源，强制使用偽幣或日幣購買這種物資，又如嚴密封鎖沿海口岸，搜查擾亂外國輪船，以阻止中國商品之輸出。還擊日本的這種進攻，最有力的辦法，就是英國强硬的對抗，英國只要運用合法的手段，主張自己的權益，也就可以發生効力。日本要攫奪各地租界的政治經濟權，封鎖九個口岸，英國更應當有切實的表示，採取有效的辦法。</p>
<h3>太平洋防務會議　張伯倫聲稱結果圓滿　英政府決繼續援華</h3>

<p>博士申請之答覆、似覺缺少同情心、遠東局勢極不滿意、英輪被截搜、武官被扣留、士兵被刺殺、整個局面、均足令人憂慮云、外相哈立法克斯當分別答復如下、（一）希望外籍志願兵卽將迅速離開西班牙、（二）英政府無力制止德意以軍火　與佛　哥、蓋此舉並無背約之處、（三）對遠東局勢、政府極為重親、並已竭力保障該處英僑之生命財產、英國决以全力促請其他各國採取同樣步驟、（四）關於顧維鈞博士申請、史尼爾責以欠缺同情、但顧博十事後曾向渠致謝、故渠良心自問無　、（五）對外國談判、英政府就各國特殊情勢分別進行、但目前未便將談判詳情公布、</p>
<p>關於波蘭</p>
<p>可參看英首相於四月六日與波外長成立協定時所發表之宣言，根據該宣言、英對波政府所提保證乃係相互性質、希望不久兩國可以成立長久之協定、吾人向羅馬尼亞及希臘所提出之保證、形式上純為片面的、目下尙不須作進一步之釋義、此項保證、如羅希獨立顯受威脅、卽行運用、至於英土談判、第一階段、巳於五月十二日完成、希望全部工作、最近便可完成、哈氏又提及由外交部派遣代表至莫斯科、以促進英蘇談判、謂過去數星期之政府舉措、與英國傳統外交政策、　有重大分野、吾人須明瞭他國之觀點、及使他國明瞭吾國之立場，實至關重要、</p>
<p>吾人願望</p>
<p>為全力從事以和平解决紛爭、故以一方面之强力行為、摧殘另一國家之獨立，巳成過去事實、如有重作此種嘗試者、必受廣泛堅强之抵抗、惟國家之獨立、為人所承認、則英國當盡景予德國及歐洲其他國家以經濟之便利、吾人固未有在經演方面困擾德國之意也、關於召開國際會議一事、余對此舉能否解决爭端、不無疑憂、德國之一切要求非均能在會議　上公開討論、以獲得解决者、英國極願各方之要求、相互調整、以求水久之和平、吾人殊願一切紛爭、均以談判之方法、獲得解决、而</p>
<p>不應用武</p>
<p>力、因國際生活必須如此始能進行也、余非謂戰爭乃不可避免者、但歐洲頗有複雜之問題、如不加以謹愼之處理、極易引起戰事、如戰爭一旦爆發、不論時期久長與否及情况如何、余對戰爭之結果、極為明瞭、發動戰禍者必遭遇抵抗、且亦深知戰後之惡果、余實不信渠等不知以談判方式解决紛爭為上策也、</p>

<p>輸出數量　比前增加</p>
<p>查出口國茶之採製、分頭二三四帮及秋茶多種、頭帮茶又稱頭春茶，為雨前十日左右採製者、二帮又稱二春茶、榖雨後十日左右採製者、三帮茶又稱孑茶，為立　前後採製者、四帮茶在小滿前後採製、以上前兩帮茶為　茶、後兩帮為及茶、秋茶則在立秋及白露節所採製、最近浙、皖、贛、閩等省、頭帮茶巳上市、紛紛運抵本港、由富華公司、</p>
<p>統一收買　集中本港</p>
<p>輸出、據財部貿易委員會統計、抗戰後國茶出口比前增加、計二十六年為四〇六、五七二公担、値國幣三〇、七八七、二七四元、二十七年為四一六、四六公担、値國幣三三、〇五四、〇八五元、現財政部當局正積極增闢國茶外銷路綫、以充實外匯基金、抵償本國入超、一方面則積極改良出產、使增加銷場、最近中國茶葉公司、會在港開會討論國茶外銷計劃、該公司經與各省政府商妥、新闢西南各省新茶區、並在川、滇、康、桂、黔、各省設茶廠、</p>
<p>改良茶葉　推銷海外</p>
<p>又查浙江温州　處、今年新茶、業巳上市、從前係淸明以前採製者、因留易委員會規定、茶葉出口、必須依法結售外匯、店莊准許運滬推銷、洋莊茶除毛茶外、則絕對禁止運滬、惟毛茶之運滬、事先亦須核准、所以上海經營洋莊茶之茶棧、均已在產地及本港設辦事處營業、各辦茶之洋行、亦巳在港採辦、上海之茶市場、因亦移至本港云</p>

<h3>「青記」座談會</h3>
<p>— 落霞</p>
<p>昨天下午，中國靑年新聞記者事會香港分會，舉行第二次座談會，顧目是；「日×的新挑釁與列　遠東政策的動向』。集合　香港各大報的編輯和記者，進行集體的自我敎育，和增進宣傳的効率，這是多麼有意義的一個叙會。</p>
<p>大雨把街道洗得非常乾净，一個個靑年的記者踏着闊步，向靑年記者學會進發，不多一會，不甚寬廣的會所，已擠滿人：金仲華，羅吟圃，這些人都到齊了。鐘嗚四響，世界知識的編輯，劉思慕先生笑着起立，請大家選舉主席，一經不起大家的擁舉，劉氏終於做了主席。他把最近日×在遠東的不斷挑　與列强在遠東的動向略作解釋，然後請大家還要客氣，踴躍發言。</p>
<p>梁若塵先生，打破沉默的空氣。他先把最近日×威脅租界加緊封鎖華南的原因與用意略作報吿，他說出×國內軍政的派別分岐，意見不一，所以向在遠東政策搖擺不定挑釁，以集中國內紛歧黨派的視線。譚思文先生繼續具體地補充二梁氏的意見，說出日×侵佔租界的用意，對國際情勢關係的作用。</p>
<p>主席請李鈍靑先生談談，「×侵佔租界和×國內的情勢的關係」。「對呀，請日本問題研究專家，發表點意見」。文藝作者拉特揮口說。李氏笑了一笑，温柔地說出平沼內閣所採取的政策，與他們的外交和軍事上中間相互的矛盾，發揮得淋漓盡致。最後他用肯定的口吻說：「×國的外交政策，雖然是决定親英親美，但往往是給他們不協調的軍事行動所破壞，因為這樣慢慢地，他們的外交就不得不隨着他們的瘋狂侵略的法西斯軍閥所走的路的前進。</p>
<p>在　靜的空氣裏，有人頻頻的喚着『金先生』，於是金仲華先生便問開始發言了，他說的是「日在蒙偽邊境的挑釁與日蘇關係」，熊度老是那麽溫柔文靜，他說：「這個問題，已成過去。現在，我們很淸楚地看出，日×在遠東的挑釁對象，不是蘇聯，而是英國。他，我們更要深切地瞭解，×人是不敢向英國挑戰的啊！」這是一番多麽寳貴的說話，把大家的精神都攝住了。</p>
<p>跟　喬冠華先生也起立發言，他特別對法幣跌價一點略作報吿，於是問題又集中到這一個最新而又重要的問題上去。</p>
<p>坐最後一行的潘朗先生一仰着子說：「英美法各國在日×最近的政治和外交的陰　之下，顯然巳和過去不同，但，由於英國政府繼續妥協政策，自己巳損失了主動的優勢，增加了遠東的危難至於這次法幣的跌價，我們要從日×最近在侵華邁遇困難後的政治陰謀着眼；要從我國金融經濟現狀與政策着眼；要從英美日三國對於法幣　價，利害是否一致着眼，我們要注意，英國的妥協政第，雖會給我們以金融經濟以不利影響，但如果說這次法幣　價竟是英美對日的妥協，進而壓迫我國屈服的第一步驟，這是不正確的，就算他們有此冀圖，今日的中國己經有能力去粉碎他了</p>
<p>最後，由劉思慕先生下着結論說：「今日討論的結果』就是英日妥協在客觀上的可能牲是非常少的「談到反　陣線的形成，主要的還在張伯倫的沒有談判的誠意，不過我們相信，由於英國民意的趨向』張氏始終要老上反侵略陣綫這一條路的，所以英蘇談判成功是大有可能，這對于遠東的中日戰爭，影響很大，因此漢奸與主和派特別活　，散播謠言，來破壞這個陣線的結合，希望新聞工作者，特別予以注意！話結果結果了，家大都懷着滿意的收獲而散。</p>

<h3>好萊塢　八大公司沿革</h3>
<p>派拉蒙歷史最久　米高梅人材最多</p>
<p>號稱世界量大影城的美國好萊塢、雖然林立着許多影片公司和攝影場、但事實上擁資最厚，人材最多、出品最富、聲譽最着的、不過是派拉蒙、米高梅、華納兄弟、二十世紀福斯、環球、雷電華、倫哥比亞和聯美等八家罷了，現在把這八大公司的沿革、個別述說一下、</p>
<p>派拉蒙</p>
<p>在好萊塢影片公司中、要算牠的歷史最久遠了、是在一九二一年由亞道夫、蘇克創辦的雖然現在的董事長是巴耐白來萊彭但蘇克仍擔任經理的職位、本來蘇克是個有名的皮貨掮客、那知他一經加入了電影界、便變成電影史中的一員功臣、至於自萊彭和派拉蒙另一巨頭山姆凱滋、在未曾踏進製片的園地以前、是二個在芝加哥從事戲院工作的權戚者、而凱滋更兼任着經管米高梅公司的洛和公司的副董事長、在今日影界中、誰都知道蘇克對　片是有着超人和决一斷的才能、並且很早的發掘著曼壁克馥、羅克等老明星、派拉蒙自從成立後到一九二九年間、始終保持優秀出品的聲譽、但在同年，因為有幾個大明星給華納兄弟公司挖去、成績便一厥不振、在一九三五年又富目地改組了一下、更使整個公司受到打擊、不過近年來、由於攝影場製片主任　廉、里白隆的整頓、便又恢復了過去的聲譽、現在的基本演員、有平克勞斯貝、喬治賴甫、飽勃明斯和瑪莎蘭伊等、</p>
<p>米高梅</p>
<p>牠是由米曲羅、高爾温、和梅埃三家合併組織的一個大攝影場、當初是馬寇斯洛和手創的、以前的所有樣、是在幾家大影院和游藝集圍主持人的手中、現在却完全由洛和公司經管、實行着分工合作制、洛和本入是在一九二〇年才從事製片工作的、的確、米高梅的出品、是不同凡　，直到今日還是處於領導地位、但在二年前、會為了製片領袖歐文、斯爾堡的逝世，使出品質量一度低落、不過現在由於攝影場的頭腦和助理監襲路易、皮、梅埃的努力、重振家聲、逮到往日出品的水準了、它更有着堅强的陣容、如嘉寳、竟拉克蓋勃、茂娜洛埃、洛勃泰勒、珍妮麥唐娜、納爾　埃第、瓊克勞馥、華雷斯皮萊、史本山屆萊賽和密蓋羅納等、另外再有着許多權威　演及著名編劇家、</p>
<p>華納兄弟</p>
<p>當有聲片初創期時、牠幾乎走到破產之路、但華納兄弟斷定將來是有聲片的世界、便不惜財力的從事大量的改進、不像別家公司謹慎逐步進行、現在可以和米高梅競爭的、就是華納公司、攝影塲領袖海爾、華烈和製片家享利、勃萊克（他以前是劉別謙副手）的出品、都足以和前米高悔斯爾堡一爭日月、大明星有保羅茂尼、蓓蒂黛維絲、埃洛弗玲、詹姆賈克奈和潘德奧勃靈等、其中除了保羅外、都是華納兄弟一倆手捧起，</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯</p>
<p>牠本來不過是一家低等的攝影場、但自經權威製片家柴紐克的來歸後、聲名大噪、他早先是華納兄弟公司的一個製片家、為了雇工問題、賓主有所誤會、才退出加入聯美公司的傑菲、斯慶克旗幟下、後來又一同轉進二十世紀福斯工作、柴紐克最先不過是編寫狗明星主演的劇本，但立卽顯出他有製片天才、現在果是頭兒　兒的製片家了、福斯公司今日仍舊被操縱投資的銀行家手中、明明有泰隆飽華、洛　泰楊，唐亞曼契、愛　絲費、秀蘭鄧波兒、金惠漱、李滋三兄弟和華納裴士德等、</p>
<p>環球</p>
<p>自從被卞爾、萊姆米里出　後、曾過着好幾年窮苦生活、直到了發掘狄安娜　萍為止、又有人說該公司受着英人的經濟臂助、不知確否、耐斯安、勃勒姆　和　浮考亭、一個是董事長、一個是編劇會議的主席、他們實行新　度、沒有製片主任、個人的出品是由個人請別人會同監製、而沒有裂片主任參加意見的麻煩。</p>
<p>雷電華</p>
<p>在歐文信託公司主持下、曾改　數次、又因破產、還經過法庭的判决、現在董事長是里奧斯賓滋，而攝影場的主腦、乃是年轉製片家潘特洛、柏門、弗雷亞坦斯琴逑羅吉絲予該公司以極大助力、</p>
<p>哥倫比亞</p>
<p>那是全靠大股東享利、哥恩和賈克、哥恩兄弟的手腕、能够費　微成本、製造良好的作品、經濟方面是不易發生困難了、更聘用名導演法蘭卡潑拉、他的出品、大半成功、賣座不衰、</p>
<p>聯美</p>
<p>傑哥倫比亞公司一　、主要的營業、是拍攝和分配影片、沒有自已直接管轄的影戲院、由四個巨頭組成、晏麗璧克馥、范朋克、卓別蟻和格烈富斯、其中祗有卓別　仍在演片、這家公司的得有成就、依　三個製片家、山姆高爾溫、華德惠根、和大衛西茨尼克是、尤其是高爾温、更使聯美賺進不少綫財</p>

<h3>娘子軍大會籃球　申報杯今夕開賽　具仁俠精神為難胞請命</h3>

<p>（本報專訊）抗戰軍興、全國動員、無論男、也無論女、咸具×愾同仇之心、為中華民族生存而奮鬥、</p>
<p>本港籃球圈裏的女健兒、此次為難胞請命、參加申報杯義賽、柔腸俠骨、不愧為巾幗英雄、</p>
<p>義賽今晚揭幕、四路大軍、全數出動、七時第一仗、西南戰知行、八時第二役、中華對華雄、</p>
<p>知行娘子軍、多為曩日廣州女中敎忠袍澤、各個技術、有聲於時、今夕登場、定有　爽的演出、</p>
<p>西南多後起之秀、朝氣蓬勃、且以純粹一校名義的組織、參加此囘義舉、一種仁俠精神、至堪嘉佩、</p>

<p>華雄各個的球藝、似亦不弱、惟恐聯絡方面、未得周密、出而抗職中華、顯然有强弱之別、中華必勝當為意中事，</p>

<h3>中華棒球隊　再戰岷甸奴　今天是第二循環開始</h3>
<p>中華團雪恥九有番劇爭</p>
<p>（本報專訊）採雙循環比賽制制的公開椿球、到今天巳轉入第二期戰爭了、</p>
<p>囘顧第一期戰爭中、原定的三十場比賽、其中因雨影響而致展期的有十多場、故錦標問題、至今尙無眉目、</p>
<p>核算各隊過去戰績、以友啤至佳三戰三勝、雄心勃勃、直視　標似為不可移動的目標、其次則為中華、三戰二勝一敗、前途亦大有可為、雖則它所得績分，目下洛在友碑之後、然來日方長、戰事尙多、總要努力、急起直追、復以其實力如此充沛、則於努力之下、定可會築成一個惟我獨尊的地位、</p>
<p>友啤樹大招風、難保將來無失敗、尤其重要的則與中華對壘、它斷不敢自謂必勝就是遇着其他各隊、也未嘗無困難、所以、未來戰局加何變化、很難擔測、不過對錦標方面、則仍以中華及友隊呼聲最高、</p>
<p>至於南華的實力、在去週對中華一役中、巳揭露無遺、弱點頗多似非爭標主角、復因包家平、馮景祥二將巳離港南遊，失此好手、影嚮其前途甚大</p>
<p>香港及西洋兩隊，表堂優劣、時價不同、演出好的時候、可望意外收獲、壞的時候、則必遭敗績、故對錦標徒為他人作嫁而巳、</p>
<p>岷甸奴亦為勁旅之一、至今所有績分、尙與中華相等、且在第一循環中、它曾戰勝中華、視為當時得意之作、而中華亦因受此打擊、白璧玷瑕、致末能與友啤並駕齊驅、實認為憾事、故對一箭之仇、永記在心、</p>
<p>今天乃第二循環比賽的開始、又適為中華與岷隊重逢對壘之期、寃家碰頭、定有一番劇烈厮殺、而中華各員、咸抱雪恥决心、必振作精神、務求勝利、才覺痛快、</p>
<p>憶前次中華致為岷隊所敗的原因、並非技術不如人、亦非機會無所遇、在整個戰局中、中華常佔優勢、獨惜有一次陳倫英倡爾失手、　成大錯、遂陷於歷刦不復的地位、致遭慘敗、及今囘思、猶有餘憾、</p>
<p>中華經此一敗後、巳自知弱點所在、乃力求改善、復得前廣州培正名將胡國棟加入効力、遂卽將陣綫改編、調倫英守二壘、國楝則充一壘、因而防守力量、增强起來、去週大勝南華、巳可見一斑、</p>
<p>岷隊巳經三次戰役、演出俱未見得體、卽以擊敗中華一役而論、亦無若何特異的貢獻、其次對西洋之戰、甚覺失常、險遭敗北、至敗於友啤一役、尤見一籌莫展、故我認定它的實力、尙在中華之下、</p>
<p>今天華在防守方面、如能設法減少一切錯誤的發生、以嚴密防禦法、對鎖岷隊跑壘員之前進、局時投手如有佳妙演出、控制得宜、避免對方擊手將球擊中的威脅、及於捕殺與刺殺方面、施展快捷與縝密的工作、那末、勝利在握了</p>
<h3>一九四四年　世界運動會　多國要求主辦</h3>
<p>【倫敦七日電】國際奧林匹克委員會舉行例會、主要之議案為關於第五屆冬季世運中滑雪比賽之問題及下屆世運會開會地點問題、</p>
<p>五屆冬季世運原己定在瑞士之聖摩利士舉行、惟因滑雪比賽是否包括在秩序之內一問題、發生爭議、委員會現决議、給予瑞士以一最後機會、令其同意于滑雪比賽之舉行、倘瑞士仍不承諾、則决將取消在瑞士舉行冬季大會之原議案而另選新址云、</p>
<p>關于下屆一九四四年會場問題、瑞士、美國及波蘭之代表均起立演說、表示願意承辦、瑞士代表提出之地點為洛桑、美國代表則為提脫洛德、此外尙有倫敦、羅馬及蒙脫里爾（加拿大）雅典及東京等地亦作同樣聲請、委員會對此尙無議决案、將俟詳細審議後再行决定、一般人相信以英美之請求較為有望云、</p>
<p>委員會又對籃球及手球之加入競賽節目加以否决理由、為「無充分時間」、</p>
<h3>讀「體育教育改進案」</h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>有系統的進展、全國的學校體育、就可以用通一的敎材、達成同一的目標、敎員不得隨便敷衍、學生趕不上進度的、體育分數可不予及格、使它不得升級或畢業、自然不敢再生玩忽之心、而考核一個學校的體育成績、也可以免除以少數選手獲得　標、就可代表一校體育成績的虛僞體育、而觀察全校學生能否適合進度、來判定它體育訓　的眞實成績、一舉數得，何樂不為呢、</p>
<p>二、推行社會體育必須利用鄉鎭的保中長—案中關於社會體育的推行、凡體育場的增加充實、各界體育活動的提倡獎勵、民衆體育社團的鼓勵　貼等、都有詳密的規定、不過所獎勵提倡的、大多是屬於民衆自動的活動、以我國目前民衆對於體育訓練的情况而論、能够自動組織、自動的從事體育活動的、實是鳳毛　角、終年不知運動為何物的、是佔　對多數、一部分民衆、日常工作間雖多少有活動身體的機會、但　陂依重、局部的發　居多、　要普遍發展的活動、來加以補救、是　明顯的事實、所以要眞正普遍推行社會的體育，佼社會體育能確實收敦、非從這多數無</p>
<p>慣的民衆着手不可、</p>
<p>這樣衆多的民衆和廣大的地區內、要切實的准行體育、先决條件、當然要造成大量的體育幹部、這種幹部的造成、最簡便、嚴切實、最經濟的辦法、莫如訓練各鄉鎭的保甲長、因為保甲長多是民衆所推戴的、他們整日和民衆相處、隨時可以實行訓練的工作、政府倘規定這種工作，為他們必盡的責任、可以不必另支薪給、所以利用他們來担任　種工作、一定可以收事半工倍之效，（二）</p>

<h3>介紹「國際文學」</h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>『國際文學』，這是一本概括地綜論了現階段的國際文學和蘇聯文學的書，在這一本書中，對於第一次世界大戰以後國際文學底新的形勢，有着十分簡要而明瞭的分析，同時在近代的國際文學發展道路的前頭，提示了好些新的重要的問題，指出了今後國際文學底創作的新路向；並對現階段中的蘇聯交學，作了很精很精細很正確的述說。它是一九三四年八月中旬蘇聯作家第一次代表大會中的演辭底　刊，其中包括了時唐諾夫，拉德克，法　耶夫，易萬諾夫，沙邦諾夫和高爾基等人的演說　報告，全書的理論大致上都非常正羅，實在是一本値得一讀的書。</p>
<p>在這裏，高爾基一共有兩篇演辭，第一篇是關于蘇聯文學的報告，第二篇是作家代表大會的閉會辭。正如同在其他的論文之中一樣，這一位偉大的世界文學巨人在這兩篇寅辭中他遺留下了好些關於世界文學，關于藝術史，關于創作形式方面的珍貴的意見，他分析了人類藝術底原始階段的發展形態，指出了原始藝術的社會基礎與社會門爭，從人　藝術之整個的發展過程之概括的檢忖批判之中，深刻的告訴我們以近代世界文學之裘落與萎弱原因，向人們提示了蘇聯文學之新的前途，指出「我們現在的時代是充滿莫大的的悲哀的悲劇的一個時代，因此我們應當準備，學習怎樣去用古代悲劇家所用的美妙的描寫形式去形容現代的悲劇」，關于這一個已經逝去了巨人底這許多寳貴的遺訓，我們今日實在有着十二萬分的必要去汲取，去發掘，藉以積蓄我們自己的國家之藝術的理論認識，培養我們的文學之整個的體系。</p>
<p>除了高爾的兩篇報告以外，這里還有著一篇最主要的演辭，那就是拉　克關於世界文學的報告和結論，拉德克在他自己的政治認識和哲學思維上，雖然有著他的嚴重的錯誤，但是在這一篇關于世界文學的報告和結論之中，我們却發見不到他有甚麼重大的缺陷，他對於第一次世界之後的世界文學與戰爭，革命，法西斯蒂底相互間的影響，作了深刻的全般觀察，分析了新興的文藝之向上與向前，同時在「詹姆斯。喬意斯呢還是社會主義的寫實主義呢」一節裏，把形式主義與現實主義之間的區別判明了，把形式主義的缺點淸算了，而且指出新興現實主義形式創造的道路。</p>
<p>拉德克對于世界文學形勢的分析是正確的，雖然現實進展到我們目前的今日，國際文學已經有了許多與那一個時候不同的地方，比如曾經爲拉氏幾次稱揚的日本新興文藝運動　現在已遭受了日本法西軍閱的殘酷破壤，日本文藝的整個形勢，今日巳爲之一變，但是，整個國際文學上的基本形勢，都仍不曾達到另外一價基本飛　的階段，未曾有决定的變化，因此，我們在今日來讀拉德克這一篇報告，仍是有着它的認識的意義的。</p>
<p>法捷耶夫在這裏的一篇演辭，創迭光榮不朽的形式」，也是一篇有着極重要的意義的文章，可以和拉德克對於形式主義和現實主義方面的意見比照來讀，法　耶夫比較拉德克更精密更具體的指出了形式創造的基礎，指出了動的現實主義　作方法之本質的特徵，向藝術批評提出了「新的形式之追求」的任務，這些都是很足以爲今日我們中國的藝術批評底　鏡的寳貴見解，是値得我們去學習的。至于沙邦諾夫關于「文學中的遠東」底演辭對中國，日本，高麗的文字都有簡單的叙述，從這裏我們可以看出蘇聯作家對于東方文學的關切，以及看出他們對于中國文學底認職底程度之深淺。</p>
<p>最爲美中不足的，就是這講對于中國的兩個代表的演辭不曾　鋒，不過在中國對于這激綜論國際文學的書籍這樣貧弱的目前，遺一本書無論如何都是値得我們介紹的，雖然它已經是人家一九三四年的演辭，而在中國，它們仍有着今日的意義的。</p>
<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>一成都，再會了！</p>
<p>到了成都已九天了，四處托人買車票，找車子，上西安去，都沒有一點頭緒。這一天，三月十一日，淸早起來，一種焦急的情懷使我獨自個兒上四川公路局去詢問。那位職員說今天恰恰有一部車子要開，可是，票子早賣完了。他垂頭呆看着我的名片，彷彿很可惜似的。我張大其詞地對他說：</p>
<p>「我有非常重要的事，非立刻動身趕到西安去不可。車子擠那麼一個人絕沒有問題，何况我又沒有行李的。請你無論如何騰出一個位子給我吧。」他搔搔頭皮，躊躇一會，說道：</p>
<p>「好的，我打電話去車站問問車子開出了沒有。</p>
<p>他拿起電話機，接上線，間了，對方說車子正準備開出。他堅决地向站長說：</p>
<p>「有一位林先生因公非立刻趕上西安不可，請你無論如何等一等，給他留下一個位子。」</p>
<p>他掛了電話機，囘轉頭來對我說：</p>
<p>「林先生！行了，請你快點兒上北門車站去吧。」</p>
<p>我謝過他之後，卽刻坐車子囘到燈籠街西北電影公司去，提了小皮箱，由松康兄送着我上車站去了。</p>
<p>車子子十一時正開出，是無蓬的大卡車，載滿了一重又一重的行李，行李上面，還坐著二十四位客人，十四位男客，四位女客，四位女孩，二位男孩，大家像豬一樣，壓在車廂子廛。這種場合，男女的界限簡直是無形中給消滅了，任你是妙齡美貌的少女吧，也得你靠着男人的大腿，男人壓着你的胸脯了。而大家也不以這樣爲苦，反而說：</p>
<p>「我們等這個車子等了一個多月了，一次兩次三次說要開都開不成，今天終于能够開成了，眞是天大的幸運啦。……」</p>
<p>由此可以知道內地的交通困難，是到了怎樣可驚的程度。</p>
<p>車由成都北站開出後，往北走，經廣漢，德陽，羅江，入夜十特，才到縣陽縣城，下車住宿。因爲我們的車子開得遲，許多旁的車子，由成都北行的，或由漢中南來的，都先到了，我們到時，各旅店已給住滿了，我們一行廿四人，連車夫共廿六人，好容易才找到了客棧，而我，沒有跟人家去搶床位，位子都給人家搶先了，由茶房的設法，才在另一陌生人的房找到一個鋪位。</p>
<p>早晨只吃了八分錢的包子和一杯開水，中午車子並沒有停下來吃飯，到這時已是晚上十時半了。忙上飯館找東西吃去。叫了兩個菜，一個湯，拿飯來，飯粗黑得像我們鄕下人拿去　豬的糙米一樣，很難吃得下咽，吃了一點菜，喝點湯，肚子便不飽也像飽起來似的了。</p>
<p>囘到客棧裏，細看看自己的住房，是一丈見方左右的小房子，兩張板床，掛著變黑色的白蚊帳，用麥桿當褥子，黑棉被，　子，椅子，痰盂，什麼都沒有，也沒有窗子，卽使是在白天吧，恐怕也是吹熄了洋油燈，便是伸手不見五指的暗室裏。空氣是臭的，我囘憶起上海，香港和廣州的大旅店，不禁慨嘆這兒和　兒相隔着三四個世紀了。</p>
<p>我不敢脫衣服，就穿着西裝上床睡覺。我剛上床，那位同室者也囘來了，是頹頭垢面的流氓。我心裏更加不安了，這一晚，就始終沒有合過一會眼，晨四時便起來候車趕程了。（未完）</p>
<h3>漫談副刊作家</h3>
<p>— 羅英</p>
<p>抗戰，使集中的文化巨業分佈在全國各都市，×××××××××××。</p>
<p>新型的報紙，以突擊的姿態興起來；新鮮的副刊，一天天地進步，生長；大大小小的期刊，也以塹新的面貌出現。</p>
<p>要是沒有一羣靑年鬥士的埋頭苦幹，怎能做成這從來未有的新局面？</p>
<p>從許多進步的刷刊裏面，我們可以讀到不少成熟的小說，速寫報告，詩歌和各部門的文藝創作。有意義的雜感，隨筆，和含有戰鬥性的理論，雜文，尤其能够正常地跟一切有毒素的思想，漢奸理論，作無情的鬥爭。</p>
<p>多重要而繁複的工作喲</p>
<p>可是這工作，除了一部份歸成名作家負担外，大部份都落在一羣無名的，初學寫作的靑年作家身上，這年靑的一羣，不是從各都市流亡到這裏的智職份子，便是半工半寫的文化工人。他們天天在生活的威脅下，在不斷的學習中榨出點點滴滴貧弱的汗和血。無助地運用着他們僅有武器。沒有名的要求，也沒有利的收穫。在這名不過副刊作家，利不過每元千字的艱苦工作中，他們口是埋頭地苦幹，永無止息地寫。就算一叠叠投寄了的原稿，十九被放進「應該去的地方時」，只得聳聳肩，苦笑一笑。便又從新拿起舉桿再寫。眞是，「大好題材有時蠶，嘔心滴血無盡期」。</p>
<p>他們的精神是痛苦，他們的物質是缺乏，然而他們倒沒有半點怨天尤人的表　，像過去一般頹唐文人喊出絕望的呼聲，像過去一般以才子自居的名士哼出無限的悲憤。在這千百個無名作者中，他們只固結成一個赤羣熟的，對仇敵永久憎恨的心。</p>
<p>他們需要加緊學習，但是從來就得不到一般前輩作家的一顧，而肯加以相當的指導，他們也需要團結起來，好互相學習，得到集體寫作的實益，而一個比較健全的普遍的集會，至今還沒有創立起來。</p>
<p>文藝協會一類的組織已經產生了。這不過作家們的一個集會，這裏有他們的通訊機關，有他們的座談盛會，也有他們的文藝專刊。對于這一羣無名的副刊習作者，至今仍未見有加以一點注意和扶助，假如有人主張聯絡無名作家，或是培植靑年習作者，除却向這廣大的副刊作家羣裏找尋對像之外，還有更好的地方麼？</p>
<p>爲着發揮文化抗戰的威力，爲着展開精神動員的工作，爲着保持文化兵員的不致枯竭，爲着文化後備軍各兵種的大量產生，對于這羣副刊作家有加以一盼的心要。</p>
<p>如其廣汎的普遍的文藝集會始終沒有組成的可能，副刊作家自己也得迅速地團結起來，以求勝任愉快地負起國家民族的巨艱，從不容逼地應付暴風雨的大時代。</p>
<p>生長在一切都注重集體的新時代裏，散漫的，各自爲戰的工作態度，根本就要不得。</p>
<p>以憫人有限的力量來應付無限的文化巨業，本來已是不可能，尤其當混戰在民族鬥的時候。</p>
<p>加緊團結，加緊學習是每個文化人應有的措施，副刊作家當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>副刊作家萬能化的積習，能避免的總該避免。社會問題也寫，國際評論也寫，文藝創作也寫，文藝理論也寫，試問在一個旣非成熟又非老到的初學寫作者的頭腦中，怎能够充分地應付這許多課題？，就算勉强寫得出來，有時也難免寫成些空空洞洞，把握不着核心的文章罷了，要寫，還是寫些『最熟悉的東西』好。</p>
<p>關於改善副刊作家的待遇，已牽涉到整個文化人的待遇問題，這就有待於整個文化團體來解决了。</p>
<p>當前的巨艱放在肩上，光明的大路擺在眼前，努力吧！靑年的副刊作家們，大家當得沉毅地，堅决地來開墾這塊未開墾的處女地！</p>
<h3>死亡綫上的順民</h3>
<p>— 曉紅</p>
<p>×人進蕪湖，將城內的維持成立後，他們便大事宜傳：『只要在這裏領着良民證就可囘家耕種，而不至受日軍的×害』，這正抓到一般逃亡在外的人們的癢處，便紛紛的囘了家向維持會領取良民證，而開始做順民了。鬼子們用了這一套把我們可憐的同胞們抓住了，便隨時用暴力來欺榨他們；</p>
<p>一，領取良民證——每人一張，（證上載有姓名，年齡，職業，住址，及號碼）每張價値一角，每月更換一次，每次出費五分，如有遺失者必須登報聲明，并由保長或店保簽名蓋章，才得補領。</p>
<p>（二）凡是能够幫助生產的動物，（如牛，魚老鷹等），均須領取保證單，才不至被×子牽去，（領一個牛牌于要出五角錢）。</p>
<p>（三）雞猪……等衆畜，均任日人取食，稻草給其充作馬草，弄得百姓們以至有米無草燒。</p>
<p>（四）男子常被拉去做苦工，女子被拉去供其××，小孩子有的被帶去後，便音信無踪，這都是良民證所不能保護的。。</p>
<p>（五）日軍下鄉時農民都跑了，便在人愛搜取衣物……等件，帶囘去交給當地的漢奸，要物主拿錢來贖取。</p>
<p>在這樣的欺壓下，人民是時有反抗的，可是因為他們是沒有組織的反抗，所以，仍然在死亡綫上掙扎著。</p>
<p>可是壓力愈大，反抗力也隨着增長，民衆漸漸的和×子們對立起來，便集中鄉間的私槍而成立義勇隊，大刀會等團體，屢與×子對抗，（萬春）××鄉的大刀會，曾打死×軍班長一名（羅家）××渡的義勇隊，打死×子二名，接着（烏溪）××鎭的義勇隊，奪取×子大衣及軍用品數船，這都是在今年一月間的事，後來他們又同國軍如新四軍取得聯絡這樣一來×子大起恐慌了。便利用漢奸來挑撥離間，各義勇隊及大刀會的團結，還一陰謀，的確有了相當的效果，因爲那些義勇隊及大刀會的領袖，都是一班有勇無謀名利心太重的「大爺二爺」們，他們缺乏正確的國家民族的觀念，就很容易上×子的當了，自己便來互相吞併，結果是兩敗俱傷，殘餘下來的成爲「偽綏靖隊便在鄉間代替了「×子」，因此便轉移了民衆的目標，而痛恨這班「義勇隊」了，還時×子又來一套×花樣：在表面上常說要肅淸道班「勇義隊」，而實在是縱容他們去幹，弄得百姓們倍加痛苦，白天裏要防×子來檢查，夜間又怕「義勇隊」來「游擊」，他們意過這樣非人的生活嗎，他們為什麼不逃脫這××的地獄呢，實在，他們被土地的鐵鍊鎖住了。</p>
<p>同胞們，請不要忘記了這整千響萬的淪陷區的同胞吧，他們是不願做亡國奴的，而且抗日的情緒是相當的高。可惜缺乏了很好的領導者，把這很高的情緒結合起來，造成一條鐵的長城，把×人孤立在城市內使他不能越城池一步，有機會則予以打擊！勇敢的革命者，到淪陷區去吧，只要有羣衆，到處都可存身，那裏，並不都是甘心做順民的，他們正是很勇敢的抗日戰士哩！</p>
<h3>星之殞落</h3>
<p>— 翁循</p>
<p>——紀念戰場亡友</p>
<p>你，像衣空中的一顆流星。</p>
<p>在黑暗裏放射着一道光明。</p>
<p>隨卽悄然長逝了——。</p>
<p>讓悲憤裝滿我們的雄心</p>
<p>那一夜的情景我記得最淸，</p>
<p>由你書着我們向敵前人進，</p>
<p>是你第一個衝進敵人的堡壘。</p>
<p>也是你第一個倒地，在那喜殞命</p>
<p>「弟兄，不要把任何一個敵人輕放，」</p>
<p>這是你最後的遺命和希望。</p>
<p>我們邊流着眼淚，邊扣緊槍機，</p>
<p>勇敢地對着前方。</p>
<p>背着你的屍身我們前進；</p>
<p>夜風裏響着悲壯的歌聲；</p>
<p>偶然我抬起我的頭，天上</p>
<p>已望不見那顯來時的巨星！</p>

<h3>Pacification Work in the Guangdong-Jiangxi Border Area</h3>
<p>— Rao Yan</p>
<p>(I) Reorganizing the Soon-to-be-XX Separate Action Teams</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Eastern Front Correspondent) The establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office for the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi Border Area is mainly due to the increasingly widespread scourge of the Separate Action Teams in southern Jiangxi. Their influence has expanded to the Heping and Longchuan areas of Guangdong. Before the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the organization of the Separate Action Teams had already expanded to nearly ten thousand people. The county magistrates of Dingnan and Longnan counties had already been driven out. In dozens of counties in southern Jiangxi, government orders could not be implemented in the villages. They used slogans such as "Oppose conscription," "Oppose going to the front lines," and "Jiangxi people protect Jiangxi" to deceive many people into joining. They set up checkpoints in various county borders, extorting taxes and collecting self-financing expenses under false pretenses.</p>
<p>What exactly are these Separate Action Teams? In southern Jiangxi, they are armed organizations led by × bandits. Last year, the Guangzhou National Salvation Daily published two articles specifically describing the activities of the × bandits in southern Jiangxi. At that time, the number of Separate Action Team members was only over a thousand. Their leader, Chen ×, had once been a platoon leader for ××, and later defected to become ××. He was a bandit chieftain. After the start of the War of Resistance, he served as the company commander of the Ruijin Security Company. Shortly after the ××× rebellion, he launched the Ruijin riot, kidnapping the administrative commissioner and county magistrate. After negotiations, he obtained the title of Separate Action Team, becoming an openly armed × bandit organization for a period. He openly called on the people to join the Separate Action Team to avoid military service, but they had to bring their own weapons. As a result, local tyrants and evil gentry who acted as local emperors joined the Separate Action Team in large numbers. At the same time, many pure and ignorant people believed that this was the same as the old ××, and they also poured in continuously. As a result, the Separate Action Team rapidly expanded to an alarming extent.</p>
<p>Just as these Separate Action Teams were extremely arrogant, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Wei appointed General Wu Qiwei, commander of the Ninth Group Army, as the Pacification Director of the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi Border Area, with an office in ×× County. Director Wu's main policy towards the Separate Action Teams was still to win them over politically first, and only use other methods when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Because the Separate Action Teams developed independently in various localities, although there was a systematic leadership structure, they could not be concentrated and commanded uniformly by a single order. Therefore, Director Wu only used a brigade of soldiers, and in less than a month, he basically solved this serious problem. Governance in the Dingnan and Longnan areas has returned to normal. Most of the Separate Action Teams have been concentrated and reorganized into a Provisional × Division, with the director's chief of staff serving as the division commander. A Commando Team has also been formed and is currently undergoing intensive training. Under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Wu, they will inevitably become a powerful counter-offensive force in the future, creating miracles in the history of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Although a very small number of a hundred or so people have not yet been eliminated, they have recently fled to the border between Anyuan and Longchuan. These turtles in a jar will eventually be wiped out sooner or later. The people in the border area have a more advanced understanding of the true nature of the × bandits than before. Under the leadership of the county magistrate and the Party headquarters, an anti-× bandit traitor movement has been launched in Heping. (When the Separate Action Teams invaded Heping) Several months ago, the people only drove them away. Since the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and the announcement of the ban on illegal armed forces, the people of Heping have been impolitely arresting and handing over the Separate Action Team members who entered the Heping territory to the county government for transfer to the Pacification Commissioner's Office for handling according to law. This shows that the people's level of awareness has been raised. Under the close cooperation of the army and the people, the × bandits and traitors will inevitably be wiped out.</p>
<p>(II) Resolving the Three-Year "Yellow Leaf Clan Feud" in Pengzhai, Heping</p>
<p>Due to the instigation of a geomancer who said that the Yellow family's water dam was hindering the ancestral hall of the Ye family, a clan feud over the demolition and construction of the water dam was triggered. The feud has been going on for three years. There have been many mediations in between, and the matter had already been resolved. Unfortunately, it was then ×××××××, ×× embezzled compensation (former) ×× distorted the judgment (judging that the Yellow family's water dam should be built more than three hundred zhang away from the Ye family's ancestral hall, requiring the water for irrigating more than ten mu of land to flow backwards). This conflict has been prolonged. At the beginning of the lunar year this year, the two sides engaged in another fierce feud. Since a boat belonging to the Yellow family in the city was openly looted by the Ye family and the boat owner was arrested, the feud has been expanding day by day. The feud site in Pengzhai itself has reached more than twenty li, and all the villages neighboring the Ye and Yellow families have been preparing and brewing for a feud. People from neighboring counties far away have rushed to participate on the Ye family's side. If this conflict is not resolved, and it expands from Pengzhai to the entire county, it will inevitably expand rapidly to Longchuan, because, in their view, it seems to be historically destined that they should fight once after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The reporter walked from Laolong to Heping. On the morning of April 25, the reporter passed through Pengzhai. The reporter seemed very lucky but actually unfortunate to see the last irrational battle of their struggle, because the main road had become a battlefield. I was guided by a local compatriot along a small road, climbing mountains and ridges to pass. On the mountaintop, I saw them resting from the battle. Thick smoke was everywhere, and the sound of gunfire was intermittent. The sound of artillery fire "boomed" like the × people's small cannons, covering the entire space with a layer of terrifying shadow. The combatants on both sides were invisible, shrouded in smoke, but the primitive horn sound "bu——bu——bu, bu, bu," did sound a bit chilling, and the sound of shouting and killing could not be heard clearly. The reporter couldn't help but sigh to the sky! Why not use the spirit of courage, militancy, and fearlessness of sacrifice of these compatriots in the great anti-× battlefield, but to engage in this irrational self-destruction that will last nearly three years!</p>
<p>Braving a heavy rain in the afternoon, I arrived in Heping city at seven o'clock in the evening and lodged in the hometown shop. Many fellow villagers do business here. The president of the fellow villagers association is also a "family friend" of my late father. I went to visit him that night and learned that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Wei and Commander-in-Chief Wu had come to Heping that afternoon, and representatives from all walks of life went to welcome them. They only stayed for more than three hours before returning by car to inspect the defense in Chaozhou and Shantou. My luck was really too bad. If I had arrived a day earlier, wouldn't I have been able to meet two great leaders at the same time?</p>
<p>When I mentioned the clan feud, they told me that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Wei had inquired about this matter very seriously in the afternoon, and scolded the county magistrate Shou for why he couldn't resolve this case earlier. He said sternly: "If they still don't listen to the resolution, burn all their houses. China doesn't need this group of ignorant people!"</p>
<p>Director Wu has transferred two companies of people to go to Pengzhai immediately to carry out the task of suppression, and left behind a young and brave Brigade Commander Xue and Director Wu's personal Secretary Zhang to be jointly responsible for resolving this clan feud. Due to my relationship with Secretary Zhang as fellow villagers, I am very clear about the ins and outs of the handling of this case, its difficulties, its development, the draft resolution he proposed, and its results.</p>
<p>The case has already been concluded. In addition to the Ye and Yellow families regretting it, the people of the entire county fully support the correctness of the verdict. The general situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The water dam issue: The Ye family is unreasonable. This is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Yellow family must build it, but the construction site should be twenty-five zhang away from the old dam.</p>
<p>(2) The clan feud issue: The Yellow family started by killing three Ye family deities. The Yellow family was fined 8,000 yuan, and the Ye family was fined 5,000 yuan. The two sides compensated each other for murder. The first killer paid 600 yuan for compensation and pension, and the retaliator paid 500 yuan for compensation and pension.</p>
<p>(3) In order to permanently end the feud between the two sides, both sides surrendered their broadswords to the government, each side handed in 150 guns, and each side sent out 80 strong men, including all the murderers, who, after training, were transferred to the front line to resist Japan (the parties concerned shall issue a guarantee that the strong men will not escape).</p>
<p>(4) The Ye family beat the police, and was fined 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>(5) All fines shall be kept by the county government party department salvation groups and county schools to send representatives to organize the management committee. Distribution of fines: 2,000 yuan to make up for the loss of the Yellow family, 1,000 yuan to make up for the loss of the Ye family. 1,000 yuan to run the salvation cadre training class, 500 yuan for the Heping Daily, and the rest will be used to subsidize and run universal education funds. (The distribution of this fine must be approved by the Pacification Commissioner's Office before it can be used)</p>
<p>(6) The robbery case is handled as a bandit case and has nothing to do with the clan feud. (When the reporter left Heping, one person had already been shot, and it is said that there were still several to be shot.)</p>
<p>(7) Attachment: The quota for pulling troops and land tax, etc., owed in the past shall be paid off clearly within three days.</p>
<p>Looking at the group, it seems that these conditions are quite harsh, but in fact they are not harsh. They have ancestral money. They go outside to invite clansmen and relatives to help. Their strong men are concentrated like an army going to the battlefield, which is completely using these money. As for the guns, some were made by ancestors, and some were privately made by gentry. There is no problem in handing them over. Moreover, the government did not confiscate their guns, but kept them by the government. If winter defense is needed, or to fight Japanese guerrillas, the gentry can submit a request to receive them, and the government can also return them according to actual needs.</p>
<p>There are also some sporadic events worth recording. When all the relevant personnel from both sides were gathered in the county government to wait for interrogation, Brigade Commander Xue first opened the bandit case and immediately tied the leader to the execution ground and shot him dead (at the same time, he was also one of the protagonists of the clan feud). The gentry were so frightened that their faces turned ashen. After a brief interrogation, Brigade Commander Xue announced the full text of the verdict, asking the gentry on each article: "Do you agree?" "Agree." "Can you do it?" "Can you do it." (The draft conditions are 100 strong men and 300 guns) "Can it be done within seven days?" "Yes!" At that time, the situation was that, except for "shooting to death," almost any condition could be agreed to. Later, the people on both sides took a group photo together, and then detained ten main people from each side and locked them in a large room together. At night, when Secretary Zhang went to the room to see them, they seemed to have completely forgotten the three years of hatred of the duel, but were discussing how to jointly request a reduction in the conditions. Secretary Zhang immediately took this opportunity to carry out his political education!</p>
<p>In the three years of clan feud, no one knows exactly how many people died on both sides. Only those who were captured and killed are made public, because killing one more person on the other side means one point of victory for them. No one is willing to admit defeat. Because of this, after the strong men on both sides died in battle, in addition to the ancestral property subsidizing the pensions, the families of the deceased were not allowed to wear filial piety or cry, and they were buried silently. If the news is leaked, or the other party knows about it because his family howls and cries, it is a crime, and this crime is punished by "deprivation of life."</p>
<p>Secretary Zhang told me that when the case is over, all the gentry and all the main figures on both sides will be brought to the King of Hell in a solemn manner to take an oath: "If there is a clan feud on both sides, the children and grandchildren will be extinct." Also, ask some officials to supervise the oath. They are most afraid of swearing and cursing. It is still very useful to do this to those feudal remnants.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of clan feud in Heping is very prevalent. According to everyone's criticism, this solution is the most proper, thorough and thoughtful.</p>
<p>(III) Shooting Huang Juchuan, a Big Local Tyrant in Dingnan</p>
<p>Huang Juchuan is from Dingnan County (adjacent to Heping and belongs to the southernmost county of Jiangxi). He was born as a scholar. He is a local tyrant in Dingnan. He has a part of armed forces, so he disregards national laws, acts recklessly, collects taxes arbitrarily, and oppresses the common people. This guy was arrested at the same time as the clan feud case.</p>
<p>When Commander-in-Chief Zhang Wei passed through Dingnan, he learned about this matter and immediately asked Director Wu to issue a warrant to shoot him. Director Wu has always been very serious in doing things. He did ask the secretary to write the warrant, but did not issue it for execution, only instructed the secretary and Yu Chang to interrogate clearly before enforcing the law. During this period, they came to Heping to handle the Ye Huang clan feud case again. Huang Juchuan also has considerable supernatural powers, entrusting people to find ways to rescue him. In fact, there was also a certain × agency requesting a transfer of the crime, but Brigade Commander Xue refused.</p>
<p>It is said that Commander-in-Chief Zhang is most disgusted with local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials and corrupt officials. When he arrived in Meixian, he asked Director Wu: Has that Huang Juchuan been shot? He asked Director Wu to send a telegram to ask, and Director Wu knew that he had not been shot yet. Under the urging of the commander-in-chief, he sent a telegram to Heping, calling Zhang Secretary to accompany Brigade Commander Xue to jointly interrogate Huang Juchuan, and if the evidence is solid, he will be shot on the spot.</p>
<p>The day after receiving the telegram was the first joint trial of the Huang Ye case. They decided to go to Dingnan immediately after the joint trial was over, but at twelve o'clock noon the next day, an adjutant from the general headquarters arrived and brought another hand warrant from Director Wu: "No need to bring him for trial, shoot him on the spot immediately." It turned out that the adjutant came to Heping from Shantou by car. He met the commander-in-chief's car on the way. After the car stopped, the commander-in-chief asked Director Wu again: "Has Huang Juchuan's matter been resolved?" Director Wu said: "He will be shot after the interrogation." The commander-in-chief said impatiently: "No need for this set. Shoot this bastard." So, Director Wu issued such a warrant again.</p>
<p>At four o'clock that afternoon, the Ye family, who was a bandit in the case, was shot, and at five o'clock, a special car carrying Brigade Commander Xue set off for Dingnan. At seven o'clock in the evening, the news of Huang Juchuan's shooting was transmitted to Heping through the telephone line.</p>
<p>A supreme commander-in-chief can be so concerned about Zeng Fang's affairs and can deal with the problems of corruption and local bullies so severely. This is worthy of our praise and love. If Brigade Commander Xue and Secretary Zhang can solve the long-standing problems in the locality in such a thorough and reasonable manner, and faithfully implement the tasks given to him by the superiors, this is even more worthy of all military and government personnel and local officials to earnestly imitate and learn!</p>
<p>The politics of Guangdong has indeed ushered in a new dawn, but the dark side is really too big. Most of the people of Guangdong are still living in a bleak shadow. The light is ahead, but it is only within sight but not within reach. In today's situation where the big × is in front of us, it is certainly necessary for the vast majority of the people to work hard and strive to find a way out in the "anti-Japanese first" position, but to refresh the political structure, the national spiritual mobilization carried out nationwide, first of all, requires all government personnel to play an exemplary role, and all of this is still urgently needed today, because the current administrative organs are, after all, the driving force for the vast majority of the people!</p>
<h3>Current Status of Chinese Higher Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The current status of Chinese higher education (including universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools) has recently been thoroughly investigated and statistically compiled by the Ministry of Education. Excerpts are provided below:</p>
<p>Pre-War Establishment</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, the imperial examination system was abolished, and schools were established, modeling their systems after various Western countries, particularly Japan. At that time, higher education institutions included "University Halls," "Higher Learning Halls," "Higher Industrial Learning Halls," "Law and Political Science Halls," and "Advanced Normal Learning Halls." The curriculum emphasized Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for practical application. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the education system was revised, and specialized education included universities and specialized schools, each divided into preparatory and undergraduate courses. With the reform of the eleven-year education system, single-discipline universities were established, and advanced normal schools were renamed normal universities. Regulations were introduced regarding the establishment and subject selection within universities. Consequently, many specialized schools and advanced normal schools across the country were hastily renamed universities or normal universities. The number of universities increased rapidly, and the graduation years were effectively shortened, inevitably affecting the academic level of some students. After the establishment of the National Government, the "University Organization Law," "University Regulations," "Specialized School Organization Law," and "Revised Specialized School Organization Regulations," etc., were promulgated successively. For more than a decade, the establishment of all schools above the specialized level nationwide was based on these guidelines, and no changes were made until the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, there were a total of 208 schools above the specialized level nationwide. Based on the nature of the schools, they can be divided into three types: universities, colleges, and specialized schools. There were 42 universities (16 national, 7 provincial, and 19 private), 34 colleges (5 national, 8 provincial, and 21 private), and 32 specialized schools (6 national, 16 public and provincial/municipal, and 10 private). Comparatively, universities were the most numerous, followed by colleges, and specialized schools were the fewest.</p>
<p>Based on the nature of establishment, they can be further divided into four types: national, public, provincial/municipal, and private. There were 27 national schools (16 universities, 5 colleges, and 6 specialized schools), 2 public specialized schools (the Wusong Merchant Marine Specialized School established by the Ministry of Transportation and the Physical Education Specialized School established by the Central Guoshu (Martial Arts) Institute, both considered public), 29 provincial/municipal schools (7 universities, 8 colleges, and 14 specialized schools), and 50 private schools (19 universities, 21 colleges, and 10 specialized schools). Private schools were more numerous than national or provincial/municipal schools. However, if national, provincial, and municipal schools are combined as public institutions, totaling 58 schools, they still outnumbered private schools.</p>
<p>Regarding their distribution, they can be divided into five regions: northern, central, eastern, southern, and northwestern. The northern region, including the provinces and cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, had a total of 30 schools. The central region, including the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Henan, and Hunan, had a total of 17 schools. The eastern region, including the provinces and cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, had a total of 45 schools. The southern region, including the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou, had a total of 13 schools. The northwestern region, including the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, had a total of 3 schools. The eastern region ranked first, the northern region ranked second, the central region ranked third, the southern region ranked fourth, and the northwestern region had the fewest. Among the regions, Shanghai alone had 25 schools, Beiping had 14 schools, Guangzhou had 7 schools, and Nanjing had 6 schools.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the establishment of schools above the specialized level emphasized universities while neglecting specialized schools. In the university sector, development was mostly organic, lacking overall planning, and thus concentrated in a few cities. In recent years, there has been a trend toward development in remote provinces, but it has not yet achieved its ideal purpose. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance, provinces and regions without schools above the specialized level, besides the three northeastern provinces, still included Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Xikang, Ningxia, and the two regions of Mongolia and Tibet.</p>
<p>Wartime Relocation</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, the Ministry of Education, to ensure the safety of schools at all levels and to preserve existing equipment, stipulated measures for handling schools in war zones before the outbreak of war. It instructed education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities, as well as schools above the specialized level, to consider the situation and select relatively safe areas for relocation in preparation for the outbreak or approach of war. The relocation could be done by individual schools, or by combining students from various schools and grades under unified management, temporarily merging, or temporarily attaching to other schools, or even temporarily closing. After the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, and the subsequent Battle of Shanghai, the areas around Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang mostly became war zones. Except for a few schools within the concessions, those near the war zones all began to relocate. After the Battle of Xuzhou, Wuhan and Guangzhou were simultaneously threatened, and schools above the specialized level in central and southern China could no longer maintain classes and had to plan for relocation. At that time, military transportation was heavy, and boats and vehicles were scarce. Faculty, staff, and their cherished equipment all traversed the roads, enduring hardship and experiencing unexpected losses. Fortunately, most reached safe locations and resumed classes. As for the relocation areas, some moved into concessions or neighboring counties, while others moved deep into the interior, reaching Shaanxi and Gansu in the northwest, and remote Yunnan and Guizhou in the southwest, and going up the Yangtze River to various parts of Sichuan in the center. Areas previously considered inconvenient for transportation and undeveloped in higher education have now become forests of academies. This large-scale relocation of schools above the specialized level, although unavoidable, has greatly benefited the social and cultural development of the inland provinces. The relocation situations of the schools are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those relocated within their respective provinces included: National Northwest Associated University (jointly established by Peking University, Peking Normal University, and Peiyang Engineering College), Shaanxi Provincial Medical Specialized School, National Xiamen University, National Hunan University, Henan Provincial Henan University, Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Specialized School, Fujian Provincial Medical Specialized School, Private Fujian Union College, Private Hwa Nan Women's College, Private Fujian College, Zhejiang Provincial Medicine Specialized School, Jiangxi Provincial Industrial Specialized School, Jiangxi Provincial Medical Specialized School, Hubei Provincial Agricultural Specialized School, Guangdong Provincial Physical Education Specialized School, Guangdong Provincial Xiangqin Business College, Private Guangdong National University, and Private Guangzhou University, totaling 18 schools.</p>
<p>(2) Those relocated to Shaanxi and Gansu included: Private Sichuan Zhiyi Medical Specialized School (relocated to Shaanxi) and Private Jiaozuo Institute of Technology (relocated to Gansu), totaling 2 schools.</p>
<p>(3) Those relocated to Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi included: National Southwest Associated University (jointly established by Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University), National Tongji University, National Sun Yat-sen University, National Chung Cheng Medical College (all relocated to Yunnan), National Jiangsu Medical College, National Jiaotong University Tangshan College of Engineering, National Art Specialized School, Private Daxia University, Private Xiangya Medical College (all relocated to Guizhou), National Zhejiang University, National Guoshu Physical Education Specialized School, Jiangsu Provincial Education College, Guangdong Provincial Education College, Private Wuchang Hua Chung University, and Private Wuxi Guoxue Research Academy (all relocated to Guangxi), totaling 15 schools.</p>
<p>(4) Those relocated to Hunan and Sichuan included: National Central University, National Wuhan University, National Northeastern University, National Pharmaceutical Specialized School, Private Dental Specialized School, Shandong Provincial Medical Specialized School, Private Ginling University, Private Guanghua University, Private Fudan University, Private Wuchang University, Private Cheeloo University, Private Chaoyang College, Private Ginling Women's College, Private Wuchang Wenhua Library Specialized School, Private Wuchang Art Specialized School, Jiangsu Provincial Bank Specialized School, and Private Beiping Minguo College, totaling 17 schools. Besides the above schools that relocated to their respective provinces and the rear areas, schools that relocated to the Shanghai concessions included: Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Shanghai Business College, Music Specialized School, and private schools such as Datong University, Soochow University, Shanghai Law College, Chih Tze College, Cheng Feng College of Arts and Sciences, Hangchow University, Nantong College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Tong Teh Medical College, Southeast Medical College, East Asia Physical Education Specialized School, Shanghai Art Specialized School, and Xinhua Art Specialized School. Da Hsia University has relocated to Guizhou and established a branch in Shanghai. Fudan University has relocated to Sichuan and established a branch in Shanghai. Guanghua University relocated to the Shanghai Concession and established a branch in Sichuan. Those holding classes in Hong Kong included: Private Lingnan University, Guangdong Guanghua Medical College, and the branch schools of Guangdong National University and Guangzhou University. In total, 77 schools were affected by the war and relocated, excluding schools that were suspended. (A total of 17 schools were suspended, and the 77 relocated, making a total of 94 schools that were affected by the war and unable to open in their original locations.) Those that were able to continue classes as usual included only the National Medical College of Shanghai, the Sino-French National Engineering College, Private Aurora University, Shanghai Political Science and Law College, Yenching University of Beiping, Fu Jen Catholic University, Sino-French University of Beiping, Peking Union Medical College, Railway Specialized School in Beiping, and the Tianjin Private Institute of Business and Commerce, totaling 10 schools. These were either located in concessions or relied on the Church. Only a few schools that were originally located in the rear areas, such as the National Sichuan University, Sichuan Provincial Chongqing University, Sichuan Education College, Private West China Union University in Sichuan Province, National Yunnan University in Yunnan Province, Provincial Guangxi University in Guangxi Province, Provincial Gansu College in Gansu Province, Provincial Xinjiang College in Xinjiang Province, Private Zhizhi Agricultural and Commercial Specialized School in Hunan Province, and the newly established National Guiyang Medical College, Normal College, Northwest Institute of Technology, Northwest Agricultural College, and Jiangxi Provincial Veterinary Medicine Specialized School, maintained their normal operations because they were originally located in the rear areas and were never relocated. However, there were only a dozen or so such schools.</p>
<p>Reorganization, Merger, and Suspension</p>
<p>When Beiping and Tianjin fell, more than ten thousand faculty, staff, and students from schools above the specialized level successively went south. Due to funding and equipment constraints, the Ministry of Education combined the National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the private Nankai University into the National Changsha Provisional University, which was later renamed the National Southwest Associated University. The National Peking University, Peking Normal University, and Peiyang Engineering College were combined into the National Xi'an Provisional University, later renamed the National Northwest Associated University. Later, the National Beiping Art Specialized School and Hangzhou Art Specialized School were successively relocated. Because of their similar nature, they were also ordered to merge into the National Art Specialized School. The Tangshan College of Engineering of the National Jiaotong University and the Beiping Railway Management College were suspended for a time after the fall of Beiping and Tianjin. Soon, the Tangshan College of Engineering resumed classes in Hunan, and the Railway Management College was merged into it. As the war zone expanded, schools of the same nature that had relocated often gathered in one place, and school buildings and equipment were often simplified due to necessity, making it difficult to increase teaching efficiency. In order to adjust departments, improve content, and enrich the curriculum, the Ministry of Education established the National Northwest Institute of Technology and the Northwest Agricultural College in 1938. The Northwest Institute of Technology was formed by merging the College of Engineering of the National Northwest Associated University, the College of Engineering of Northeastern University, and the Private Jiaozuo Institute of Technology. The Northwest Agricultural College was formed by merging the College of Agriculture of the National Northwest Associated University and the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Specialized School. The aim was to concentrate human and material resources to lay the foundation for northwest industry and be the vanguard for developing northwest industrial and agricultural enterprises. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College and the Medical Department of the Private Nantong College served in the war zone and eventually entered Hunan. Because their equipment was relatively well-preserved, they were also ordered to merge and reorganize into the National Jiangsu Medical College to meet the important needs of the war of resistance. Recently, the Ministry of Education, because most medical schools and colleges are concentrated in Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces, has re-established centralized management methods to enable concerted efforts and increase educational effectiveness. As for Yunnan Provincial University, the Executive Yuan had already resolved to change it to a national university in 1937, and the reorganization was implemented in 1938. The Central Guoshu Institute Physical Education Specialized School, originally established by the Central Guoshu Institute, was also changed to a national institution at the same time and renamed the National Guoshu Physical Education Specialized School, directly under the Ministry of Education. In addition, the Guangdong Provincial Government, due to financial constraints, merged the College of Engineering of the Provincial Xiangqin University into Sun Yat-sen University, and the Business College and Education College were renamed the Provincial Xiangqin Business College and the Provincial Education College, respectively, and were established independently.</p>
<p>The above is the situation of reorganization and merger of various schools above the specialized level. The number of schools that were temporarily suspended due to the impact of the war, being destroyed, or being unable to maintain operations after relocation was also considerable. These included: Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Women's Normal College, Medical College, Agricultural College, Shanxi Provincial Shanxi University, Industrial Specialized School, Commercial Specialized School, Agricultural Specialized School, Shandong Provincial Rural Construction School, Shanghai Municipal Physical Education Specialized School, and Beiping Municipal Physical Education Specialized School. The National Shandong University temporarily closed after relocating to Wanxian due to a lack of equipment. Anhui Provincial Anhui University also suspended operations after relocating to Shashi due to financial difficulties. The Wusong Merchant Marine Specialized School was in the war zone at the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai and could not be relocated, and soon closed down. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Specialized School was suspended for more than a year after the fall of Suzhou. Although some students resumed classes in Shanghai, there was no prospect of restoring the school for a time. The Private China College still maintained classes in Beiping, but the details need to be investigated. In total, 16 schools above the specialized level were suspended due to the War of Resistance (3 universities, 4 colleges, 8 specialized schools, and 1 with unclear status), which is truly an unprecedented disaster in the history of Chinese education.</p>
<h3>How to Mobilize Rural Women? Work Experience of Wartime Rural Service Teams (Continued)</h3>
<p>Nurseries are very simple because the team members are already using their limited resources, and all supplies and food are donated by wealthy people in the local area. Older children are also given appropriate education in the nurseries. Every evening, mothers who have finished working in the fields or factories during the spring plowing season take their children back home to live, and every morning they hand over their children to the nurseries.</p>
<p>There is a type of nursery that is time-specific, only accepting children in the evening, specifically for mothers who are studying in literacy classes, because when they are studying, they must hand over the children in their arms to the nursery, and when they finish studying, they take their children back.</p>
<p>The number of children accepted in nurseries varies from more than a dozen to forty, and the largest scale is for the workers of the ×× factory, accepting more than 200 children. It has now been taken over by the factory authorities and is doing very well.</p>
<p>(6) The spirit of the team members must be very simple and solemn, and they must carefully consider and handle all work and the environment, and endure hardships. They do not joke casually, they do not casually eat at the homes of villagers, or accept gifts from villagers. They have to travel dozens of miles of mountain roads and paths, regardless of the rain. At the same time, they never forget their self-education, reading newspapers, holding seminars, and constantly reviewing their work and life.</p>
<p>Their work has been effective. Mr. Chen said with emotion: "If this work had been launched five years ago, China's rural areas would have been 'definitely mobilized'." Whenever they leave a certain township, large and small local people shout to keep them.</p>
<p>They fear that when they leave, the efforts they have put in there will be wasted, so on the one hand, they organize local working cadres to continue their work, and on the other hand, they go for a round of inspections after a while.</p>
<p>Local governments cannot give them very good assistance. Economic difficulties and the lack of songs suitable for villagers, and the difficulty of reaching villages with propaganda materials such as newspapers, cartoons, and photographs, are all conditions that hinder their better development.

<h3>New Developments in the Battle Situation in Northern Hunan, Stalemate on All Fronts, Focus of the Shanxi Battle in the Southwest, Our Army Once Attacked Xinxiang and Wujin</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, September 9] The situation in Jiangxi and Guangdong is quiet, with only small local battles. In northern Hunan, north of the Xinqiang River, our forces have been attacking for days, and the enemy's array is fluctuating. We are taking advantage of the situation to advance, and there will be new developments within days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, September 9] The enemy in southwestern Shanxi is advancing toward Liulin and Qikou and is now trapped. The enemy near Yuncheng and Anyi is still under our control. The enemy chief Mitsui is commanding in Yuncheng, and the enemy is increasing reinforcements in an attempt to attack our Yanxiyun and Fenglingdu again. The enemy artillery was attacked by us yesterday, with heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, September 9] In central Hubei, more than 400 enemy troops in Qianjiang and about 2,000 enemy troops in Lanyuekou are under our close surveillance. The enemy in Duobaowan and Luohan Temple has been shelling the west bank of the river in recent days, which is a harassing nature. Our army in Anhui Province has been very active recently, and a large number of enemy troops have been annihilated near Bengbu and Haozhou. The traffic on the Jinpu Railway has been disrupted by us and cut off twice in three days. A part of the enemy in Hubei withdrew to Hankou.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou, August 8] Our troops intercepted the enemy in Huaiyang area and captured two or three hundred people. It is reported that Xinxiang was recently attacked and captured by us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanyang, July 7] According to a phone call from Tongbai, about 500 enemy infantry and cavalry, with more than ten artillery pieces, advanced from Xinyang via Erdaogou to the Hei'ao Xiangjia Village area on the 5th. Our army has intercepted them.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guilin, August 8] Our battle results on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway are remarkable. A certain unit of our army recently attacked and captured Wujin, killing more than 50 enemy troops. In Yixing, Lishui, and Yifu, the enemy casualties are nearly a thousand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Miluo, September 9] Our troops on the north bank of the Xinqiang River have been sweeping away the remaining enemy troops for days, and their momentum is like a broken bamboo. All the original strongholds have been recovered, and the encirclement of Yueyang is still maintained. On the northern Hunan front, there is only contact between sentries. Although enemy ships on the Jiumazui Lake travel back and forth from time to time, they only engage in artillery battles with us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, September 9] According to Su Bei military news, Xia Dingwen, the county magistrate of Muyang County, led his troops to besiege Muyang County on the morning of the 3rd. At 5 pm, they entered the city, but the enemy is still stubbornly resisting. We are searching in separate directions.</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Economic Warfare, the Government Decides on Countermeasures, Authorizes Local Banks to Prevent the Enemy from Absorbing Legal Tender, Intensifies Resource Development, and Develops Export Trade</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shanghai] In order to enhance the economic strength of the War of Resistance, prevent the enemy from undermining legal tender in North China, and prevent enemy industrialists from absorbing raw materials in the occupied areas, the government has decided on countermeasures. Local banks in various provinces are authorized to issue subsidiary coins, and banks are allowed to withdraw banknotes at any time. Because after the legal tender or local bank notes are confiscated, they can be easily exchanged for foreign exchange, which endangers the position of the legal tender in foreign exchange. In addition, it is forbidden to flow legal tender into the occupied areas or to flow out of the country, restricting loans to the occupied areas, and carrying legal tender to the occupied areas. As for the legal tender in the occupied areas, efforts will be made to tighten it, and one-yuan banknotes and subsidiary coin coupons will be issued. At the same time, local banks in various provinces should investigate the local economic resources and report to the government. After approval, the government and the People's Bank will jointly invest in the development, and the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, will be responsible for providing short-term and long-term loans for industry and mining. At the same time, the four banks will also be responsible for the main responsibilities of the Export Trade Committee and rural loans. All agricultural and mineral products that can be exported will be purchased. Each bank will build its own warehouse, and the bulk purchase of goods can be guaranteed by the Central Trust Bureau. Personnel engaged in the transfer of products can be exempted from military service. When there is a shortage of transportation tools, each bank can consult with the local military authorities to facilitate them, so as to coordinate military and economic forces in the transfer of products in various places, and prevent hoarding. Each bank must also find ways to use financial power to balance them, and pay attention to transportation methods to share the surplus and supply the deficit. When prices rise sharply, it is necessary to examine the reasons for it and adjust them. Local governments must also work with local chambers of commerce and trade unions to establish price stabilization committees and use various methods to seek price stability in various places.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Expresses Concern about Fluctuations in the Shanghai Financial Market, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Memorandums to Other Countries, Explaining the Relationship between Legal Tender and Puppet Hua Bank Notes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, September 9] Chinese newspapers here today did not publish the situation in the Shanghai financial market. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying the matter and will report on it soon. According to official confirmed news, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday sent identical memorandums to the embassies of various countries in China.

<h3>Financial Circles Speculate on the Future of Legal Tender, Stopping the Sale of Foreign Exchange Aims to打击the Enemy, Authorities Have New Decisions on Exchange Rate Levels, Prices Rose Once Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[News from Hong Kong] Our Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has stopped selling foreign exchange in order to cope with the enemy's conspiracy to disrupt our national currency. The price of the national currency has fallen as a result, but our fund is solid, and the future of legal tender is not affected. Yesterday, due to the good morale, the price of the national currency in Hong Kong yesterday morning rose from 46 to 48, but in the afternoon it fell back to 453. As for the Haoyuan banknotes in Guangdong Province, it rose from 375 to 378 in the morning and then fell back to 368. At the close of the market last night, it fell back to 36. The financial circles are not pessimistic about the future of the national currency, and they believe that our government has a whole plan for maintaining foreign exchange. Stopping the sale of foreign exchange is a temporary measure to combat the enemy's conspiracy, and the credit of legal tender can eventually be maintained. Also, a financial authority made the following remarks to a reporter from a Western newspaper in Hong Kong: Over the past week, the Exchange Stabilization Fund has not been subjected to any pressure, and the credit of the national currency has not changed slightly. Last Wednesday, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will stop selling foreign exchange, with the purpose of obtaining a better economic level for the exchange rate. At the same time, foreign trade can also reach an equilibrium. It is remembered that in June 1938, the government also took the same steps and stopped selling foreign exchange. At that time, the exchange rate level was set at one yuan worth eight pence, and this price remained unchanged for twelve months. The stability of foreign exchange can be seen. It is believed that the government authorities have made a decision on the new level of exchange rate, and they will be able to adhere to it in the future. According to reports from all sides, this year's agricultural harvest has a very good symbol. This high harvest of agricultural products will reduce the import of foreign products, and the demand for foreign exchange will also decrease at the same time. As for the foreign exchange needed by the government to purchase military supplies and other goods from abroad, there are specific and appropriate methods to maintain it, and it should not be involved in the ordinary foreign exchange market. Someone also said that the government is in the process of planning in order to enrich the Exchange Stabilization Fund and expand its foundation, and the results obtained are very good. The government has great confidence in maintaining foreign exchange, and there is really no problem. Although the current level of foreign exchange has changed slightly, it is only a temporary nature. The people's faith in legal tender is still maintained, because the legal tender fund is sufficient and can be guaranteed to be exchanged at any time.</p>
<h3>Under the Protracted War of Attrition, the Enemy's Combat Power Is Exhausted, and It Is Difficult to Allocate Insufficient Troops</h3>
<p>Our Military Affairs Committee Issues Enemy Intelligence Report</p>
<p>[Guangwu News Agency, Shaoguan Express News] Japan's combat power has been exhausted since the war. At the recent secret meeting, in addition to discussing how to deal with the new situation in Europe, how to continue to support the war of aggression against China was also one of the main agendas. The headquarters of the Fourth War Zone received a telegram from the Central Military Affairs Committee yesterday regarding the content of the enemy's ministerial meeting, knowing that the enemy is extremely anxious, and ordered all officers and men under its jurisdiction to be notified to strengthen their morale. Excerpts are as follows: (1) On the first day of the new year, the enemy's Prime Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Foreign Minister Arita held a secret consultation for the whole day. The content was roughly about the Mediterranean issue, and the recent strong morale of our army, a general offensive on all fronts, and the enemy's troops were insufficient to allocate. Should elite troops be concentrated in one place, or should all fronts be taken care of at the same time? Although the results of the talks were kept strictly secret, and nothing was leaked, the tense attitude of the four people after the meeting did not seem to have optimistic conclusions. (2) From January to March this year, the enemy's troops in Shanxi consumed a lot. During each battle, they used fierce firepower to fire aimlessly. According to confidential reports, each enemy regiment had only more than 600 soldiers left. According to statistics, the enemy fought with us a total of 330 times last month. The total number of enemy soldiers was 688,600. A total of 4,932 people were killed, and 2,258 were injured. The acting commander of the Fourth War Zone immediately ordered the commanders of each group army to inform all their subordinates to know that the enemy's strength has been exhausted and that the time for collapse is not far away. All should step up their efforts.</p>

<h3>The Dunkerley Incident: Strong British Protest; Miura Visited Phillips Yesterday to Discuss Recent British-Japanese Disputes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] Regarding the Dunkerley incident, the British Consul-General here delivered a strong protest to the Japanese Consul-General this afternoon. The main points of the protest are as follows: (1) After capturing Dunkerley, Japanese soldiers inflicted bayonet wounds, leading to his death; (2) The Japanese side failed to provide Dunkerley with timely and appropriate medical treatment; (3) The Japanese side refused the British authorities' requests to allow consular officials to visit Dunkerley on the afternoon of the 6th, and did not allow foreign doctors to examine him, leading to Dunkerley's death from severe injuries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 9th] While British Consulate officials were delivering the British protest note regarding the Dunkerley incident to the Japanese side, the Japanese Consul-General personally visited the British Consul-General to discuss recent events between Britain and Japan. Afterwards, a Japanese spokesperson stated, "It is entirely due to the British side's inability to understand Japan's activities. As for the Dunkerley incident, it was entirely because Dunkerley ignored the Japanese army's power to maintain peace and order and mistakenly believed he was X."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 9th] Yesterday, the British Consul-General in Shanghai lodged a serious protest with the Japanese authorities, stating that anti-British activities in the Japanese-occupied area have become increasingly apparent, and that this is the reason for British factory strikes and other incidents, as well as the direct cause of the death of British national Dunkerley from injuries.

Regarding the recent conflicts between British nationals and the Japanese army, the Japanese side's view is that British nationals have not paid attention to the Japanese army's military and preventative measures during wartime, hence these conflicts often occur. Furthermore, the British authorities' desire to protect their interests in China must respect Japan's serious defensive methods. The steps taken by the British side are beneficial to the Chinese government.</p>

<h3>The Scripture Society on the Punan Frontline (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— By Jin Zairong, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper on the Shanxi Battlefield</p>
<p>The "Red Society" is a feudalistic and superstitious spontaneous organization of the people. When they worship the gods, no one is allowed to see, and each member keeps the details of the worship secret, refusing to tell anyone. However, in terms of organization, it no longer has the feudalistic flavor of the past "Senior Brother" or "First Brother." Now they are organized into teams and squads, and there are also children's squads.</p>
<p>The next morning, I visited another "Red Society" two miles away from ××, in ×× Village, which is the main village for organizing villages in this area and is also two miles away from the enemy's X. The leader is an older man who is not very X but is very resolute. "Ah, if we don't do it at this time, we won't survive!" "When there was no organization, the enemy came every day, but now they dare not come!" "I am old, but my son is doing it. I will never escape." This is what he told me, and it is enough to represent the voices of the people who do not want to be slaves to a conquered nation.</p>
<p>As for weapons, the "Red Society" here is very lacking. They only have spears and broadswords; ×× Village only has nine rifles and two pistols, and some don't even have a single gun. However, their anti-Japanese sentiment is very high. However, they have the following shortcomings:</p>
<p>First, their organization is a spontaneous organization of the people, and the military and political leadership is insufficient. They do not have proper military training, so they blindly rush into battle. At the same time, there is practically no political leadership, so their anti-Japanese sentiment may not be able to maintain its consistency. Second, these groups are a combination of landlords and peasants under the slogan of "protecting the homeland," so they have not broken away from the narrow clan mentality and adhere to the principle of "if people do not offend me, I will not offend them." Third, their consciousness is incorrect. They are all confident that they have the protection of "gods," and their courage is placed on the "gods." For example, after the battle on February 3rd, when some people were killed and injured, they blamed those who were killed and injured for running in front of the "god flag" and ignored the exposed X and the disadvantage of lacking firearms. Fourth, the disorganization of the peasants still exists. Fifth, they still do not know how to cherish resources (such as randomly firing guns X). Sixth, they lack weapons for combat, and only having some "close combat" weapons is not enough.</p>
<p>Although they are a feudalistic and superstitious organization, they are distributed on the enemy's flanks and rear, posing the most fatal threat to the enemy. We must do our best to prevent them from being assimilated by the enemy's appeasement policies. In particular, it is hoped that the authorities of various garrison troops will adopt X policies towards the "Red Society," so that the work of winning them over can be easily completed.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to put forward a few methods for winning them over for everyone's reference:</p>
<p>First, send political cadres to join the association to raise their anti-Japanese sentiment and gradually transform their superstitious ideas; second, provide them with as much material assistance as possible (especially guns, ammunition, and strengthen their military training to overcome the disorganization of the peasants; third, promote a grand alliance of various Taoist sects to strengthen their unity and jointly deal with Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>I hope that people who are concerned about this issue will put forward more and more correct opinions so that the "Red Society" will become stronger and more active day by day, increasing our strength in the war of resistance. Mao X, May 16, 28</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Vigorously Advocate Seizing Concessions in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] This morning, the Japanese newspapers all published editorials attacking the public concessions in China. According to the "Kokumin Shimbun," Japan is determined to rescue all of Asia and give it freedom, so the issue of public concessions must be resolved. At the same time, Japan must expel British influence from the Far East. We respectfully request the government to purge pro-British elements and strengthen relations with friendly countries. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Japan has decided to deal with all third countries in China that adopt anti-Japanese policies with a firm attitude. When necessary, Japan will take back the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Furthermore, political circles here are paying more attention to an article written by Oohashi, the delegate from the puppet Manchukuo. The article stated in brief that since Japan has decided not to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek, it must adopt the same policy to deal with Britain and the Soviet Union. If Japan does not remove the influence of third countries in China, it will be difficult to complete the sacred war of conquest. Therefore, Japan must make a major decision to carry out the establishment of the "New Order in East Asia," ignoring the interests of third countries in China, so that the "China Incident" can be concluded as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 9th] According to news from Tianjin today, because the British authorities refused to hand over Chinese "terrorists," the Japanese side intends to surround the British concession in Tianjin, isolating it from the outside world. Japanese merchants have been transporting goods stored in the British and French concessions, and so far, about 50,000 tons have been moved out. Furthermore, the British side claims that the news that the Japanese side demanded the handover of "terrorists" within 24 hours has been X by the Japanese side, but the mayor of Tianjin has ordered all Tianjin government officials to move out of the concession.</p>
<p>A Brief Comment</p>
<h3>The National Government Issues a Clear Order for the Arrest of Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>The National Government has finally issued a clear order for the strict arrest of the traitor Wang Jingwei!</p>
<p>The issuance of this arrest warrant is sufficient to prove that Wang's treasonous acts are continuing to unfold, and therefore has a very important meaning:</p>
<p>First, it completely shattered the recent rumors and slanders against the Central Government by Wang and other traitors. It boosted the morale of the compatriots in the front lines, the rear, and the occupied areas, as well as overseas, and it further solidified the foundation for the final victory of the protracted war!</p>
<p>Second, it completely cleared up the doubts of the general public and friendly countries about the government's lenient treatment of Wang. It increased the credibility of our government among the people and internationally, and it further exposed the treachery of the Japanese and the traitors.</p>
<p>Third, and more importantly, it proves that since the war of resistance, the Central Government has been X to the requests of the people, especially the overseas Chinese! It also proves the power of the united will of the whole nation. It is by no means something that a few traitors and wavering elements can slander and X! It proves that our government is a government X loyal to the nation and the people, and it proves that our people are a people who cannot be insulted!</p>
<p>The National Government's order for the arrest of Wang is another new manifestation of our political progress, and it is a signal that our national unity will be strengthened and the war of resistance will be smoother.</p>

If there is a surplus, half of it may be allocated to the provinces in proportion to the quantity of tea exported from each province to carry out various beneficial undertakings for tea farmers.

Ahead of the motorcade was a police motorcycle team, and several light tanks served as escorts in front. US Air Force planes flew neatly overhead. The British King continuously X replied to those who welcomed him, and the British Queen waved back. The cars moved very slowly, surrounded by secret agents protecting them. In addition, there was a cavalry squadron bringing up the rear.

<h3>British Special Envoy Sir Stafford Cripps to Fly to the Soviet Union Today; Soviet Ambassador Visited British Foreign Secretary Yesterday; German News Agency Again Slanders the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Sir Stafford Cripps, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, returned to London from Warsaw today and went to the Foreign Office to meet with diplomatic personnel.

<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 9th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday to discuss matters. According to well-informed sources, this concerns the Anglo-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 9th] London's "Daily Express" again urged the British government to cease negotiations with the Soviet Union. Today, former Ambassador to Japan, Sir Lindley, spoke at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, also strongly advocating that the British government halt Anglo-Soviet negotiations. However, the extremely optimistic faction who support the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement were not impressed by the arguments of the "Daily Express" and Sir Lindley. The crucial question today is: Does Moscow truly wish to unite with Britain and France? Or is it merely stalling for time? The Baltic states are unwilling to be guaranteed by other countries, while Moscow firmly demands to guarantee them, leading to doubts whether Moscow truly desires the completion of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, or is merely weakening Britain's prestige? According to well-informed circles, Halifax did not inform Maisky about the British government's plan to send Sir Stafford Cripps to the Soviet Union during their conversation yesterday, but merely mentioned the new British proposals regarding the indirect guarantee of the Baltic Sea region. The conversation did not result in a final agreement. Maisky still insists that the names of the three Baltic countries, including Lithuania, be clearly written in the "guarantee clauses." The British government has drafted a reply to the recent note from the Soviet Union and sent it to Paris for final revisions. According to this agency's Paris dispatch, the French Foreign Ministry held a meeting to discuss this matter late on Thursday (8th).</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 9th] German has signed non-aggression pacts with Latvia and Estonia in the Baltic; the Soviet paper publish news regarding this event but without any criticism. As well as British Primer Chamberlain's address at the House of Commons yesterday. Churchill's article in the "Daily Telegraph", occupied a very large space, discussing the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement and greatly defending the Soviet Union's position.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 19th] The papers this morning criticize the speeches of Chamberlain and Halifax, saying they have expressed officials information regarding the "peace movement"; the "Times" says the "adjusting" reply of a moderating tone, it seems like there is real hope; Britain has no intention of resolving all unresolvable questions with war, but if there are divergences, the two sides should jointly express the wish to make concessions, discussing the so-called "encirclement policy," the report says, though there is still divergence, Britain and France have no intention of stopping the normal momentum and economic development of Germany, but in this expansive momentum, the independence of each country must be maintained.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th] German newspapers this morning have different criticisms of Chamberlain and Halifax’s speeches yesterday, discussing Chamberlain’s comments regarding preparing to reaffirm today’s position, and Halifax’s announcement that he would examine all economic issues, the “Observer” says that regardless of whether today’s European situation is fair, British policy should ultimately bear the responsibility, and this change in tone is not a genuine change in British policy, but merely a strategic shift, because Britain has suffered setbacks in its anti-aggression activities. Britain's attempt to form an alliance with the Soviet Union has not succeeded, and is unlikely to succeed in the near future, because the Baltic states have refused to accept guarantees.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] According to news published in yesterday afternoon's newspapers, French political circles have not expressed extreme welcome for the British government's dispatch of Foreign Office Director of Central Europe, Sir Stafford Cripps, to Moscow. It is said that Moscow has made it clear that it needs a internationally renowned representative to discuss the difficult problems encountered in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, and pointed out that Sir Stafford Cripps has only limited authority, apart from being able to propose or accept proposals for reconciliation, he cannot freely decide on replies to the Soviet side, and if the situation is difficult, he must return to London to seek the government's opinion. The Soviet Union believes that the British special envoy to Moscow should be Foreign Secretary Halifax, and the French newspapers also share the same view. "Le Parisien" declared that Chamberlain must recognize the dangers of Sir Stafford Cripps' mission. The Prime Minister once personally flew to Berchtesgaden, but now he is sending a career diplomat to bear an extremely important mission, which is truly surprising. The report also pointed out that Sir Stafford Cripps is a figure who supports the Munich policy. Furthermore, "L'Intransigeant," which usually represents the views of the Foreign Ministry, said that an agreement cannot be concluded within the next ten days, even under good circumstances. It is heard that Sir Stafford Cripps will carry the Anglo-French reply to the Soviet Union. According to well-informed British sources, this reply indicates the British government's limitations on granting the Soviet Union's demands.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Deal with Japan's Monetary War Offensive</h3>
<p>Japan's full-scale war of aggression against China has recently taken on a special characteristic: because of the slowing down of military offensives, it has switched to political and economic offensives. Of course, political and economic strategies have been used in conjunction before, but not as actively and obviously as recently, especially the economic offensive. In recent months, the Japanese government and public opinion have been enthusiastically discussing the resilience of the legal tender in our War of Resistance and how to destroy it. The specific policy is reflected in the recent offensive against our legal tender.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the rapid attack of the Japanese monetary policy and our urgent response, the black market price of the legal tender plummeted. Obviously, this is due to the Japanese collecting legal tender to convert to our foreign exchange and the Japanese using political means in Shanghai. According to a certain source, the Japanese side has indeed used more than 90 million legal tender recently to achieve this goal. In order to deal with this sudden attack, we have ordered the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Balance Fund Committee to order banks in Shanghai such as HSBC and Standard Chartered to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign exchange at the old prices. In this struggle, although we are taking emergency measures, we are indeed in a proactive position.</p>
<p>In response to this Japanese monetary policy offensive, in addition to the passive measures adopted by the government, we also advocate active measures. The following is a brief expression of our views:</p>
<p>First, the plummeting of the black market of legal tender did not start today, the decline has gradually intensified in the past two or three months: from "55.78" in April (calculated in Hong Kong dollars per hundred) to "54.60" in May, and then to "54.511" in early June, and yesterday afternoon it even fell to "46.50." There are both near and far causes here. The active way is to eliminate the distant cause. The so-called distant causes can be roughly divided into the excessive amount of hot money in Shanghai and Hong Kong and the decline in foreign trade. The former is because our country's hot money is concentrated in Shanghai and Hong Kong with the expansion of the occupied areas, and some people engage in speculation, resulting in an excess of legal tender in foreign exchange; the latter is because our country's industries are destroyed and capital is withdrawn from production, resulting in a phenomenon of less exports and more imports, thus increasing the need for foreign exchange. Therefore, the active prevention method is to encourage and promote national capital to invest in production in the inland, which can not only absorb hot money, but also increase exports and reduce imports, which can be said to be a triple win. However, the implementation of this policy requires the close cooperation of national capitalists and the government. In fact, it is safer and more profitable for national capital to invest in various industries in the southwest and northwest rather than fleeing to Shanghai and Hong Kong and being exposed to the danger of such exchange rate changes.</p>
<p>Second, resisting the Japanese monetary war offensive also requires the close cooperation between China and Britain. The Japanese often claim that the resilience of the legal tender today is mostly due to British support, and we do not deny this fact. But what we want to urge Britain to pay special attention to is that the future of the legal tender is closely related to British interests, and the British government should fully understand Strabolgi's words: "China is fighting for Britain." Japan's monetary war against China, in addition to using economic means, also uses "non-economic" strategies, namely political strategies, such as blockading the source of goods in Shanghai, forcibly using counterfeit coins or Japanese currency to purchase these goods, and strictly blockading coastal ports, searching and disrupting foreign ships to prevent the export of Chinese goods. The most effective way to counter this Japanese offensive is strong British confrontation. As long as Britain uses legal means and asserts its own rights and interests, it can also be effective. Japan wants to seize the political and economic rights of the concession areas everywhere and block nine ports, and Britain should have a concrete expression and take effective measures.</p>
<h3>Pacific Defense Conference; Chamberlain Claims Satisfactory Results; British Government Decides to Continue Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the report of the Pacific Defense Conference previously held in New Zealand has just been received and is being reviewed. The report is confidential and cannot be published. Furthermore, the results of the conference are recommendations to the governments concerned, so no announcement can be made before the governments concerned have completed their review. However, it can be said that the results of the conference were extremely satisfactory, and there was a frank exchange of views on matters of mutual concern in the Pacific. Later, Labour MP Mr. Fletcher asked whether the Australian representative had expressed his views at the meeting, since Australia's defense depends entirely on the presence of a main fleet in Singapore, and it may be difficult to send a similar fleet to Australia in the near future. The Prime Minister replied that he did not dare to agree with what Mr. Fletcher said, and that he would report on this matter, but could not say anything more at present. Mr. Fletcher then asked, does the Prime Minister not know that the above opinion was expressed by the Australian Minister of Defense? The Prime Minister did not reply to this. Later, Under-Secretary of State Butler answered questions about Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech in Geneva, stating that the government intends to continue to promote the implementation of the resolution passed by the League of Nations to give China great sympathy and assistance. Conservative MP Mr. Morgan asked what implementation the government had made to the League of Nations resolution. Under-Secretary of State replied that he would send the gentleman a copy of the summary of the League of Nations Administrative Assembly meeting, which stated that the Foreign Secretary had stated in the Assembly that the British government had not violated the previous resolution of the League of Nations, and described the actions taken by the British government in accordance with the obligations of member states listed in the resolution. Later, Conservative MP Knox asked about the freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River. Under-Secretary of State replied that the ambassadors and naval commanders of Britain, France, and the United States recently gathered in Shanghai, and they would exchange views on matters of mutual concern. However, the Foreign Secretary had not heard of any formal meeting being held. Regarding British trade on the Yangtze River, British Ambassador to Japan Mr. Craigie had already made another representation to the Japanese government on the 6th of this month. Later, Mr. Fletcher asked what action the government had taken regarding the detention of Lieutenant Colonel Sir Philip Neame, the British military attaché to the Chinese Embassy, by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou. Under-Secretary of State replied that he was urgently negotiating with the Japanese authorities to release Lieutenant Colonel Sir Philip Neame as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Foreign Policy Debate; Foreign Secretary Halifax Replies Separately; Advocates Negotiations for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] When Labour MP Mr. Snell initiated a debate on foreign policy in the House of Lords today, he said that the British government was finally forced to accept the main principles of the collective security system, but the British government's delay in making a decision on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations was annoying. The reply to Dr. Wellington Koo's application seemed to lack sympathy. The Far East situation was extremely unsatisfactory. British ships were intercepted and searched, military officers were detained, and soldiers were assassinated. The entire situation was worrying. Foreign Secretary Halifax replied separately as follows: (1) He hoped that foreign volunteer soldiers would leave Spain soon. (2) The British government was unable to stop Germany and Italy from providing arms to Franco because this action did not violate any agreements. (3) The government attached great importance to the situation in the Far East and had made every effort to protect the lives and property of British nationals there. Britain was determined to urge other countries to take the same steps. (4) Regarding Dr. Wellington Koo's application, Mr. Snell accused him of lacking sympathy, but Dr. Koo thanked him afterwards, so he had a clear conscience. (5) Regarding negotiations with foreign countries, the British government conducted negotiations separately according to the specific circumstances of each country, but it was not convenient to announce the details of the negotiations at present.</p>
<p>Regarding Poland</p>
<p>Please refer to the declaration issued by the British Prime Minister on April 6 when he concluded an agreement with the Polish Foreign Minister. According to this declaration, the guarantees given by Britain to the Polish government are mutual in nature, and it is hoped that the two countries can conclude a long-term agreement soon. The guarantees we have given to Romania and Greece are purely unilateral in form, and no further interpretation is required at present. These guarantees will be used if Romania and Greece's independence is clearly threatened. As for the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the first stage was completed on May 12, and it is hoped that the entire work can be completed soon. Halifax also mentioned that the Foreign Office had sent a representative to Moscow to promote the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, saying that the government's actions in the past few weeks have had major differences with British traditional foreign policy. We must understand the viewpoints of other countries and make other countries understand our position. It is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Our Wish</p>
<p>Is to devote all our efforts to resolving disputes peacefully, so that the act of destroying the independence of one country by the forceful behavior of one party has become a thing of the past. If anyone attempts to do so again, they will be met with widespread and strong resistance. However, if the independence of a country is recognized, Britain should do its best to give Germany and other countries in Europe economic assistance. We certainly do not intend to economically distress Germany. Regarding the convening of an international conference, I have doubts about whether this move can resolve disputes. Not all of Germany's demands can be discussed publicly at the conference to obtain a solution. Britain is very willing to adjust the demands of all parties to seek lasting peace. We sincerely hope that all disputes can be resolved through negotiation, and</p>
<p>Not Using</p>
<p>Force, because international life must be able to proceed in this way. I do not mean that war is inevitable, but there are many complicated problems in Europe that can easily lead to war if not handled carefully. Once war breaks out, regardless of how long it lasts or what the situation is, I am very clear about the consequences of the war. Those who start the war will encounter resistance, and I am also well aware of the evils of the post-war era. I really do not believe that they do not know that resolving disputes through negotiation is the best policy.</p>
<h3>Thetis Investigation Concluded; British Naval Minister Rumored to Resign; Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons; Case to be Presided Over by Judge Bucknill</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 9th] This morning, a "Daily Herald" prediction states that Naval Minister Stanhope will resign from his current position after the Thetis submarine disaster investigation is completed. At the same time, he may be transferred to a less important position in the Admiralty. The newspaper believes that Stanhope's resignation may be a prelude to a major cabinet reshuffle. The reason for Stanhope's resignation may be the public's lack of confidence in him, especially the delay in Stanhope's announcement after the Thetis disaster occurred, which dissatisfied the public.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the public investigation into the Thetis submarine accident will be presided over by Judge Bucknill. Chamberlain answered questions about raising the submarine, stating that the lifting ropes had been placed under the submarine yesterday. The extent to which the submarine was flooded was greater than expected, causing the submarine to lose a lot of buoyancy. It is reported that the Admiralty Auditor General will go to Birkenhead tonight to discuss with experts to discuss what methods should be taken to make the Thetis submarine float to the surface.</p>

<h3>To Strictly Stop Banditry; First, Increase the Training of Patrol Police Officers; Rampant Banditry is Actually Due to Insufficient Allocation of Police Officers</h3>
<p>A Certain Magnate Expresses Opinions on the Two Resistance to Arrest Cases</p>
<p>Recently, banditry in Hong Kong is still rampant. Within a week, two tragic cases of armed robbery by bandits and resistance to arrest in Hong Kong and Kowloon resulted in ten deaths. Since these two tragic cases occurred, residents have been worried, deeply feeling that Hong Kong has a large population and the police are weak. Once an accident occurs, there is no way to call for help. We are honored that a certain magnate gave his opinion on these two unfortunate events, saying that since the end of last year, robbery cases have occurred almost every day, and murder and robbery have become almost commonplace. In April, the robberies in the New Territories were shocking. Recently, although the Chinese and Western military police have cooperated with the village groups to strengthen defense, the occurrence of robbery cases does not seem to have been stopped. On the 30th of last month, the Yongxiang Goldsmith Shop in Shanghai Street, Yau Ma Tei, was robbed by bandits who fired guns, and a fierce battle broke out with the military police near the railway bridge, resulting in a passing woman tragically suffering an unexpected disaster, and Chinese Detective Deng Jia and an English Officer were also injured by the bandits. Unexpectedly, not long after this case of armed robbery and resistance to arrest occurred, another case of highway robbery occurred on the 1st of this week on the most prosperous avenue, in which two Chinese detectives were intercepted and robbed by bandits who fired guns in resistance. One Chinese detective was seriously injured, and four passers-by were also innocently hit by stray bullets. As a result, one bandit was shot dead and one bandit was arrested on the spot. Since these two horrifying cases occurred, people in the community have generally believed that the audacity of bandits to be so rampant is due to the weakness of the insufficient allocation of police officers. This is because the population of Hong Kong is large and the number of households is dense. The current three thousand Chinese and Western police detectives are simply not enough to allocate. When an event occurs, although the police whistle sounds loudly, the police officers are not seen. This is not because the police officers' defense is weak. The fundamental reason is that there are many streets and the number of police officers on duty is limited. If one is taken care of, the other is lost. If a petty theft or robbery occurs in the middle of the night, every time the police whistle is heard, the residents around rise up and appear, but they do not see the police detectives. The bandits can finally escape calmly, which is enough to summarize the rest. That is, in this Li Yuan East Street robbery case, if Detectives Wan Yan and Tan Song had not passed by and bravely arrested the bandits, whether Mr. Zhang, who had a large sum of money in his pocket, could have escaped danger is still unknown. Li Yuan East Street in Hong Kong is located in Central, and Shanghai Street, which faces the sea, is also a prosperous thoroughfare. The bandits can be so fearless of the law. If other more remote places are more vulnerable, then residents are uneasy and travelers are cautious, which is inevitable. The authorities are now doing their best to maintain security in the urban area and are committed to arresting bandits, which is admirable and commendable. It is a pity that due to the insufficient allocation of police officers, those who live and work in peace are inevitably taken advantage of by petty criminals. For the sake of the authorities, it is appropriate to quickly add 1,000 to 2,000 police detectives. Even in quiet streets, there can be police detectives on strict patrol, so that residents can live in peace and travelers do not have to be cautious. This will increase the burden of government expenses (although the burden will increase by 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per year, the expenditure of government expenses in Hong Kong is very small, and adding this sum is not too much), but for the sake of maintaining law and order, there is no other way. If the authorities adopt the suggestions of the common people, why not pay attention to this?</p>
<h3>China Traveling Theater to Perform Again Regularly; The Cantonese Department of the Theater to Debut; Hosted by the Lingnan University Student Union</h3>
<p>The China Traveling Theater has been actively rebuilt by the head of the troupe, Tang Huaiqiu. After months of painstaking efforts, the troupe is quite well-known. It now has two departments, Mandarin and Cantonese, with equal strength, jointly shouldering the task of propaganda in South China. The Mandarin department previously performed "Phoenix City" at the Queen's Theater for the Women's Federation charity performance, with satisfactory results. Later, the troupe performed the play at the Queen's Theater again, and received high praise from all walks of life. It is now stepping up rehearsals of new repertoire, and it has been scheduled to hold a large-scale performance at the beginning of next month. Zheng Zhong, an important actor in the troupe, went to Chongqing due to a matter in Wuhan. Now that he has heard that the troupe has been rebuilt, he resigned from his post office job and voluntarily came to Hong Kong from a long distance. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 1st of this month, and the lineup will be even stronger from now on.</p>
<p>As for the Cantonese department of the troupe, it has been "working hard" for five months. The first phase of the program has been carefully arranged by director Zhang Xuefeng and is already very mature. Now, the Lingnan University Student Union is holding a charity performance to raise money for wounded soldiers and refugees. With the consent of the troupe, the first performance of the Cantonese department will be used for this purpose. "China Traveling" is sacrificing itself and fulfilling its obligations. It is heard that it has been scheduled to be held at the Queen's Theater at 9:00 pm on the 23rd of this month. Judging from the seriousness of the troupe's work and the enthusiasm of the Lingnan University service spirit, this charity event will definitely be a grand occasion. Details such as the performance repertoire and actor distribution will be further explored and recorded.</p>
<h3>New Tea Arrives from Various Regions, Concentrated in Hong Kong for Export</h3>
<p>Increased Sales of Chinese Tea After the War; Southwest Tea Region Newly Developed, Actively Improving Tea Varieties</p>
<p>Tea is one of China's most exported national products, with sales markets spanning the globe. In the past, merchants freely traded and transported tea, and exports were not unified. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented tea export controls,</p>
<p>Export Quantity Has Increased Compared to Before</p>
<p>Inspecting the harvesting and production of exported tea, it is divided into first, second, third, and fourth flushes, as well as autumn tea, and several varieties. The first flush is also known as the first spring tea, harvested and produced about ten days before the Rain Water solar term. The second flush is also known as the second spring tea, harvested and produced about ten days after the Grain Rain solar term. The third flush is also known as Zi (孑) tea, harvested and produced around the Beginning of Summer solar term. The fourth flush is harvested and produced around the Lesser Fullness solar term. The above first two flushes are considered top-quality tea, while the latter two flushes are considered ordinary tea. Autumn tea is harvested and produced during the Beginning of Autumn and White Dew solar terms. Recently, the first flush teas from provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian have been put on the market and are being transported to Hong Kong one after another, where they are</p>
<p>Uniformly Purchased and Concentrated in Hong Kong</p>
<p>for export by the Fuhua Company. According to statistics from the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the export of national tea has increased since the war compared to before. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], it was 406,572 quintals, valued at 30,787,274 national currency units. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], it was 416,460 quintals, valued at 33,054,085 national currency units. The current authorities of the Ministry of Finance are actively expanding export routes for national tea to replenish foreign exchange reserves and offset the country's import surplus. On the other hand, they are actively improving production to increase sales markets. Recently, the China Tea Company held a meeting in Hong Kong to discuss the export plan for national tea. The company, after consulting with the governments of various provinces, has newly developed new tea regions in various southwestern provinces and established tea factories in Sichuan, Yunnan, Kang, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces to</p>
<p>Improve Tea Leaves and Promote Sales Overseas</p>
<p>It is also reported that new tea from the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang has already been put on the market this year. Previously, it was harvested and produced before the Qingming Festival. Because the Trade Commission stipulates that tea exports must legally settle foreign exchange, stores and dealers are allowed to transport tea to Shanghai for sales. Foreign-style tea, except for raw tea, is absolutely prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. However, the transport of raw tea to Shanghai must also be approved in advance. Therefore, tea warehouses in Shanghai that handle foreign-style tea have all established offices in the producing areas and Hong Kong to conduct business. Foreign firms dealing in tea have also begun purchasing in Hong Kong. The Shanghai tea market has also moved to Hong Kong, it is said.</p>
<h3>Copper Drum Island Cargo Boat Robbery Tragedy: Ten Suspects Re-examined Yesterday; Judge Orders Continued Detention for Seventy-Two Hours</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective Zhao Gengyou, together with Assistant Superintendent Cunningham of the Water Police Department and a large team of detectives, previously went to Shenzhen Bay, Little Pipa Island, Castle Peak, and other places to crack down on a bandit den and arrest ten suspects. It is said that they are related to the tragic robbery of a straw mat cargo boat that occurred on Copper Drum Island some days ago, in which nine people were tied up and thrown into the sea, and eight people went missing. They were charged in the case. The names of the ten people are as follows: (1) Cai Lin (30 years old), (2) Liang Jin (21 years old), (3) Li Fu (26 years old), (4) Chen Liu (30 years old), (5) Li Yunxiang (27 years old), (6) Chen Gen (24 years old), (7) Zhong Jinshui (38 years old), (8) Chen Su (39 years old), (9) Chen Sheng (46 years old), (10) Li Qiu (50 years old). The above ten people are charged with (1) murdering Li Hong on Copper Drum Island on May 21, (2) robbing a cargo boat on Copper Drum Island on the same day and stealing hemp ropes, straw mats, and other items, totaling two crimes. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the Kowloon Magistracy by Magistrate Qian Si again. Prosecution Assistant Superintendent Cunningham, believing the case was serious and still needed investigation, requested the magistrate to postpone the case. The magistrate ordered the case to be postponed for seventy-two hours for re-examination.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Amateur Association Holds General Membership Social Gathering Tonight at 7 PM at the Confucius Hall</h3>
<p>Since its establishment on January 22nd, the Hong Kong Banking Industry Amateur Association has made rapid progress in its affairs, earning the praise of banking leaders. General managers, deputy managers, and assistant managers of various banks are all members of the association. Recently, due to a surge in membership, the association expanded its premises and hosted a reception for guests from all walks of life at the new location on April 6th. Financial giants such as Qian Xinzhiye, Zhuotang, Tang Shoumin, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Tang Zhai, Zhang Weiguan, Chen Yanqing, Li Beitao, and Li Nangong all attended to congratulate the association that day, making it a grand occasion. Now, in order to strengthen the bonds between members, the association has specifically scheduled the first general membership social gathering for tonight (yesterday) at 7 PM at the Confucius Hall. All entertainment programs will be performed by the association's Yinlian Drama Troupe and Yinlian Choir. The two one-act plays to be performed, one is "Mount Tai and a Feather" and the other is "The Roar of the Ancient City," are personally directed by Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the Zhongxuan Drama Troupe, a drama expert. Both the plot and acting skills are excellent. The musical program includes "Cowherd's Short Flute," "Unable to Return to My Hometown," "The Flag is Flying," and "Song of the Eight Hundred Warriors," many of which are posthumous works by the late famous music expert Huang Zi. It is foreseeable that the traffic on Gascoigne Road will be heavy that night.</p>
<h3>Flying Clipper Resumes Macau Station</h3>
<p>Hong Kong and Macau are separated by a narrow strip of water. Transportation relied solely on ships. Years ago, when Pan American established an air station in Hong Kong, it once stopped in Macau, adding an air route between Hong Kong and Macau. Later, due to difficult problems, the station was cancelled midway and it has been more than a year since. It is learned that Pan American will resume the Macau station for flying clippers starting from the 5th of this month. In the future, each flight will land in Macau. The flight from Hong Kong to Macau only takes more than 20 minutes, and transportation between Hong Kong and Macau will become more convenient.</p>
<h3>Noble to Go to Singapore Next Week</h3>
<p>Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 16th of this month aboard the flagship HMS Kent for Singapore. The return date has not yet been determined, only a mere 19,000 pounds.</p>
<h3>Estate of Former Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Nathan, Only 19,000 Pounds</h3>
<p>Sir Nathan, who served as Governor of Hong Kong from 1902 to 1907, passed away in England this April. His estate was found to be only 19,696 pounds. Nathan Road in Kowloon is named in memory of Sir Nathan.</p>
<h3>Summer Grand Lottery to Be Drawn Today; This Is the Last Race of the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of rain in Hong Kong. There was heavy rain again yesterday afternoon. Today's sixth special race is the grand finale of the first half of this year. If it is performed in the rain, it will inevitably spoil the fun. If the weather clears up at that time, the audience will be particularly crowded, because the Summer Grand Lottery tickets will be drawn and announced today. The grand prize is involved, and many people are paying attention. It is learned that the results of this ticket last year were that 164,398 tickets were sold, and the first prize was 72,258 yuan. This year, as of the cutoff yesterday afternoon, the number has broken the previous record, with a total of more than 180,000 numbers sold. There is still half a day of sales today. If it can reach 200,000 numbers, the first prize will be 85,120 yuan, the second prize will be 24,320 yuan, and the third prize will be 12,160 yuan. Each ticket can get 1,600 yuan if it wins a place. This ticket is based on the results of the final Luntou Parliamentary Race today, and the prize money is distributed according to the ticket corresponding to the top three finishers. There are a total of twenty-three or four horses registered to participate in this race. Who will be lucky enough to win this windfall?</p>
<h3>Cloth Stolen from Da Yu Fabric Factory Found in Guo Xing Fabric Store; Purchased from a Guangzhou Water Carrier; Chen Pin Innocent, Cloth Still Belongs to Guo Xing</h3>
<p>A man named Chen Pin, a shareholder of the Guo Xing fabric store on Wing On Street, was charged by British detective Du Wen at the Kowloon Magistracy yesterday afternoon, claiming that (1) on April 26th, he received four pieces of cloth lost by the plaintiff, Sun Yao, (2) that on May 2nd, he received seven more pieces of cloth lost by the plaintiff, totaling two crimes. The defendant pleaded for defense by lawyer Ford and denied guilt. During the hearing, the plaintiff, Sun Yao, testified first, saying that he was the manager of the Da Xing Weaving and Dyeing Fabric Factory on Tan Kung Tao. On April 18th, the windows of his factory were destroyed by several thugs who broke in and stole twenty pieces of cloth, each piece being forty yards long and priced at twelve yuan per piece. Later, he reported the matter to the Kowloon City Police Station. On May 26th, he went to investigate Guo Xing fabric store at a certain number on Wing On Street based on a tip-off. Upon arrival, he saw his stolen goods displayed in the store. He asked the manager of the store, Yuan Yang, who replied that he had purchased them from the defendant. The detectives also arrived after receiving his phone call and took the defendant and Yuan Yang to the police station. Next, Yuan Yang testified, saying that the defendant had been a shareholder of the Guo Xing store for two years. On April 26th, the defendant told him that he had purchased eleven pieces of blue cloth from a Guangzhou water carrier. With his consent on the same day, he first transported four pieces of cloth into the store for sale, and on May 2nd, he sold seven pieces to his store. When questioned by the magistrate, the defendant replied that a relative had introduced him to a Guangzhou water carrier from whom he had purchased the cloth currently presented in court. However, he had tried his best to find the water carrier to testify in court, but he was never found. The magistrate finally found the defendant not guilty and ordered that all the cloth be returned to Yuan Yang according to the law, with the aim of obtaining a new foreign exchange level so that our foreign trade can be balanced.</p>
<h3>Reliable Observations on the Depreciation of the National Currency</h3>
<p>aiming to achieve a new foreign exchange level so that our foreign trade can be balanced.</p>
<p>Although the price of the national currency has fallen, it has currently stabilized. According to reliable sources, the Exchange Equalization Fund has not felt any pressure in the past few weeks, and the credit of the national currency has not been shaken, which is well known. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee temporarily stopped maintaining the fund on Wednesday, allowing the foreign exchange price of the ocean to reach a better economic level, so as to balance foreign trade. It is still remembered that a similar method was adopted in June 1928, and this price was maintained for twelve months without change until it reached the level of eight shillings. It is believed that a new level has now been obtained and can be firmly maintained. Many items that were previously imported can now be manufactured domestically. It is intended to report to all parties that the expected good harvest this year will also help reduce imports. The foreign exchange required for government purchases of military supplies and other items has been determined and will not affect the foreign exchange market. Finally, the Exchange Equalization Fund has been enriched, and efforts to expand the foundation of this fund have been successful. There is no question about the authorities' ability to maintain foreign exchange. Although there is currently an adjustment in the exchange rate level, the national currency will continue to gain the trust of the public, and free foreign exchange transactions will always be guaranteed, etc.</p>

<h3>Necessary Preparations for Defending the New Territories Have Been Completed</h3>

<p>The military authorities in Hong Kong are quite active in defense measures for the New Territories, and all necessary preparations have been completed. Recently, barbed wire entanglements have been placed at key crossings in the Shatin area. The project has been underway for some days and has been completed, adding another strong guarantee for the defense of Hong Kong. It is also reported that the Indian rifle team stationed in Hong Kong is holding live ammunition new-style shooting drills in Xintian Village, New Territories, for four consecutive days, starting yesterday, continuing today and on the 13th and 14th, from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm each day.

<h3>"Youth News" Symposium</h3>
<p>— Luo Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association held its second symposium. The topic was: "New Provocations by Japan × and the Trends of Great Powers' Far East Policies." Editors and reporters from major newspapers in Hong Kong gathered to conduct collective self-education and enhance the efficiency of propaganda. This was such a meaningful gathering.</p>
<p>The heavy rain washed the streets very clean. Young reporters strode towards the Youth Journalists Association one by one. Before long, the not-so-spacious clubhouse was packed with people: Jin Zhonghua, Luo Yinpu, and all these people were present. At four o'clock, Mr. Liu Simu, the editor of World Knowledge, stood up with a smile and asked everyone to elect a chairman. Amidst everyone's support, Mr. Liu finally became the chairman. He briefly explained the recent continuous provocations by Japan × in the Far East and the trends of great powers in the Far East, and then asked everyone to be less polite and speak actively.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Ruochen broke the silent atmosphere. He first briefly reported the reasons and intentions for Japan ×'s recent threat to the concessions to tighten the blockade of South China. He said that the factions of the military and political affairs within Japan × were divided and had different opinions, so he was provoking the Far East policy in an unstable manner in order to focus the attention of the divided parties in the country. Mr. Tan Siwen continued to supplement Mr. Erliang's opinions specifically, explaining the purpose of Japan ×'s occupation of the concessions and the role of international relations.</p>
<p>The chairman asked Mr. Li Dunqing to talk about "the relationship between ×'s occupation of the concessions and the domestic situation of ×." "Yes, please ask the Japanese expert to express some opinions." Writer La Te said. Mr. Li smiled and gently spoke about the policies adopted by the Hiranuma Cabinet and the mutual contradictions between their diplomacy and military affairs, and he elaborated on them thoroughly. Finally, he said in an affirmative tone: "Although the diplomatic policy of Japan × is determined to be pro-British and pro-American, it is often undermined by their uncoordinated military actions, because in this way, their diplomacy has to follow the path of their crazy aggressive fascist warlords."</p>
<p>In the quiet atmosphere, someone frequently called "Mr. Jin," so Mr. Jin Zhonghua began to speak. What he said was "Japan's provocations on the border between Mongolia and the Soviet Union and the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union." Xiong Du was always so gentle and quiet. He said, "This question has passed. Now, we can clearly see that the target of Japan's provocations in the Far East is not the Soviet Union, but Britain. Moreover, we need to understand more deeply that Japan × does not dare to challenge Britain!" This was such a valuable speech that it captivated everyone's spirits.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiao Guanhua also stood up to speak, and he briefly reported on the depreciation of the legal tender, so the question focused on this latest and most important question.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Lang, who was sitting in the last row, said, raising his head: "The United States, Britain, and France are clearly different from the past under the recent political and diplomatic conspiracies of Japan ×, but because the British government continues its policy of compromise, it has lost the advantage of initiative and increased the difficulties in the Far East. As for the depreciation of the legal tender this time, we need to focus on the political conspiracy of Japan × after encountering difficulties in invading China recently; we need to focus on the current situation and policies of our country's financial economy; we need to focus on whether the interests of the United States, Britain, and Japan are consistent with the depreciation of the legal tender. We need to pay attention to the fact that although Britain's compromise politics will have an adverse impact on our financial economy, if we say that the depreciation of the legal tender this time is the first step for the United States and Britain to compromise with Japan and further force our country to submit, this is incorrect. Even if they have this expectation, today's China already has the ability to crush it."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Liu Simu concluded by saying: "The result of today's discussion is that the possibility of a British-Japanese compromise is very small objectively. Speaking of the formation of the anti-aggression front, the main reason is that Chamberlain does not have the sincerity to negotiate, but we believe that due to the trend of British public opinion, Mr. Zhang will always take the path of the anti-aggression front, so the success of British-Soviet negotiations is very likely, which has a great impact on the Sino-Japanese War in the Far East. Therefore, traitors and pro-peace factions are particularly active in spreading rumors to undermine the combination of this front, and we hope that journalists will pay special attention to it!" As the words ended, everyone dispersed with satisfied gains.</p>

<h3>The Eastern River Front Is Loose on the Outside and Tight on the Inside; Xiang Hanping Finishes Inspection and Orders Counterattack</h3>
<p>The war on the East River has been loose on the outside and tight on the inside in recent days. The situation on the front line has been somewhat quiet, but our deployment is very tense. After Deputy Commander Xiang went east to command and launch a large-scale guerrilla war, the morale of the various siege teams was boosted, and they attacked Japan × with a spirit of sacrifice. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Luo and Wang Ordered to Consolidate and Counterattack</p>
<p>Since yesterday, Deputy Commander Xiang summoned Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the 3rd and 4th District Guerrilla Columns, and Wang Ruozhou to inquire about the front line situation. They all believed that our army in northern Guangdong had been attacking Japan × for the past month and had achieved battle results. Our army on the East River should take the opportunity to launch an attack to harass Japan ×. After inspecting the defenses of eastern Guangdong the previous day (8th), he returned to a certain place to plan, ordering Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the 3rd District Column, and Wang Ruozhou of the 4th District Column to intensify the mobilization of teams in the entire district to attack Japan ×'s positions. Luo and Wang received the order and telegraphed each other yesterday (9th) to discuss counterattack military affairs, striving for closer contact and coordination. It is heard that the entire steps have been agreed upon, and the all-out attack military affairs are in full swing. The East River War may break out during the day.</p>
<p>Rushing into Luogang, A Great Victory</p>
<p>For the past ten days, our army on the Bo (Luo) Zeng (Cheng) line has been active in all directions, giving Japan × a heavy blow. It is learned that there were hundreds of people stationed in Luogang Japan ×'s position in the southwest suburbs of Zengcheng. The Chen regiment of our army, in coordination with the Lin Junsheng department of the 3rd District Column, suddenly attacked Japan ×'s position on the evening of the 6th. Our army secretly crossed the Zengjiang River on the front of the Bo Zeng line. Taking Japan × by surprise, they rushed into Luogang Township. The Japan × soldiers woke up from their sweet dreams and fought back in a hurry. However, our army had already deployed its forces, tightly controlled the terrain, and calmly swept at Japan × with machine guns in the fierce battle. After about two hours, our officers and soldiers fought more and more bravely, and the situation of Japan × was shaken. Soon, the Zengcheng Japan × received the news and sent a team to rescue. Our army, with the mission translated, withdrew automatically. In this battle, more than 80 people from Japan × were killed, and Cao Yan of the Japan × army also died in battle. They also seized a Japan × machine gun, more than 20 rifles, and many documents.</p>
<p>Sinking Japan × Boat on Xintang River</p>
<p>Also, in Xintang, Zengcheng, there were six or seventy Japan × electric boats and tugboats of various sizes gathered on the nearby river surface. For days, Japan × boats have been carrying grain and transporting it along the waterway to Shitan Zengcheng to supply the Japan × army. It is learned that at about 9:00 am on the 6th, there were more than ten Japan × steamers, full of grain, still sailing upstream to Shitan. A certain squadron of our department learned of Japan ×'s situation, so they ambushed on the river surface near Qiaotou Gang, Xintang. When the Japan × boats arrived, they all intercepted and attacked together. Japan × also swept the floating boat with machine guns. After a battle of about thirty minutes, two Japan × boats were sunk by us, and more than ten Japan × soldiers fell into the water and drowned. The rest of Japan × fired with intensive artillery fire. In order to avoid sacrifices, we withdrew to the original formation.</p>
<h3>Grain Shortage Still Tight in Siyi; Gu Dinghua Plans to Take Regulatory Measures</h3>
<p>After the fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, the situation was tense in various parts of Siyi (the Four Counties), and the people could not settle down in their businesses, so production was affected. Grain and rice were particularly scarce, so the price of rice in Taishan and Kaiping rose higher and higher. Recently, the price of high-quality rice has actually risen to more than 28 yuan per dan, and even low-quality rice is about 26 yuan. The people have suffered from the high cost of rice. Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the first district, has convened magistrates from various counties and commercial organizations to discuss ways to relieve the rice shortage, and it has been decided that (1) a grain regulation committee will be established to find ways to communicate grain transportation routes (2) local public funds and donations from overseas Chinese will be allocated to purchase foreign rice and transport it to the mainland for sale at a fair price. For the past month, grain and rice from Hong Kong and Macau have been continuously transported to the mainland for relief. However, the rice shortage in Siyi has not decreased slightly, and the price of rice has increased without end. Commissioner Gu believes that the suffering of the people's livelihood can easily lead to chaos, and he is actively taking measures to regulate grain, eliminate the rice shortage, and strictly investigate the manipulation of hoarding. Some days ago, special commissioners were sent to various counties to investigate everything, to investigate in detail the purchase and transport of foreign rice for fair sale, and to convene the local authorities of various counties to hold a meeting to formulate an entire plan for relief. Commissioner Gu and representatives from various counties negotiated the grain regulation measures for the four counties of Xinhui, Taishan, Enping, and Kaiping, and handed them over to the local authorities of various counties for implementation separately. In the future, the grain shortage in Siyi may be resolved thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Shantou Is Peaceful</h3>
<p>Police Authorities Strictly Investigating Rumors</p>
<p>Japan × warships have been cruising on the waters off Lingdong, and their activities have been frequent in the past week. According to detailed investigations by intelligence personnel, there are at most eight ships, and on the 8th, the number was reduced to five. Although they come and go irregularly, the number has not increased significantly. Some days ago, rumors circulated that a Japan × aircraft carrier was anchored off the coast of South China. It was found to be a Japan × cruiser equipped with two aircraft, which was used to侦察 various places. Even this Japan × aircraft has not been seen in the waters of Shantou for half a month. These are all rumors spread by traitors. The military police have already launched a strict investigation. If anyone is found to have fabricated facts and disturbed the public, they will be severely punished once the facts are ascertained.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Promotes Overseas Compatriots Returning to Serve the Country, Welcoming Specialized Technical and Medical Personnel, Encouraging the Establishment of Industries to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, overseas compatriots have contributed substantial financial and material resources. Those who have resolutely dedicated themselves to the motherland and participated in the war have also arrived in succession. Their contribution to the war effort is far from insignificant. Li Han-hun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, deeply appreciates and pays close attention to the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas compatriots. He is now launching a widespread campaign to encourage overseas compatriots to return to the country to serve and to establish industries.</p>
<p>Welcoming Return to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Chairman Li Han-hun believes that the War of Resistance requires a large amount of manpower, especially specialized personnel in machinery, medical rescue, and other fields are urgently needed. Overseas compatriots have always been enthusiastic about patriotism. In order to enable overseas compatriots to widely achieve the goal of resisting Japan and saving the country, it is specifically stipulated that specialized technical personnel in the following fields are all welcome to return to the country to serve: (1) driving cars; (2) repairing machinery; (3) manufacturing machinery; (4) mining personnel; (5) medical rescue personnel. In order to facilitate the return of overseas compatriots to serve, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office is designated to be responsible for reception.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Establishment of Industries</p>
<p>Chairman Li also believes that the current War of Resistance is the sum of our human, material, and financial resources. Developing industries and increasing production are also urgent tasks at present. He calls on the many wealthy gentry among the overseas compatriots in this province. It has now been decided to encourage overseas Chinese to return to invest and establish industries, thereby increasing the driving force for the War of Resistance. Regarding these two issues, it is permissible to write to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office to forward the messages to overseas Chinese organizations to encourage enthusiastic participation. At the same time, all county and municipal governments and agencies are instructed to protect and assist returning overseas Chinese at all times, and to punish those who treat them harshly or create obstacles, so as to avoid causing negative impressions and affecting their understanding of the motherland.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Health Department Centralizes Medical Rescue Organizations Throughout the Province, Training Medical Rescue Personnel in Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Health Department recognizes that there are many medical rescue organizations throughout the province. Among them, many have sound organizations and excellent work, while others are nominal or loosely organized and have no achievements. It has now been decided to rectify them separately, first by carrying out a registration of medical rescue organizations throughout the province to implement centralization. Those that are nominal will be eliminated. Those that are allowed to be established will be supervised and guided separately to implement their work, so that there can be a strict organization first before the function of assisting the War of Resistance can be brought into play. At the same time, due to the lack of medical rescue personnel, the front and rear health work needs people everywhere. It has been decided to strengthen the medical rescue cadres in various counties, dispatching technical personnel to organize short-term training classes in various counties to train personnel responsible for medical rescue training for the people in the counties, districts, townships, and towns, so as to be able to undertake various health tasks.</p>
<h3>Residents of Weizhou Island Forced by the Japanese to Build Roads; Unregistered Residents Executed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, refugees from Weizhou Island, Mr. Deng and others, once again risked their lives to escape. According to them, there are currently more than a hundred Japanese soldiers on the island, most of whom are engineers, stationed in the Catholic Church, Xu Zai Ling, Hou Bei Tang, Di Shui, and Jian Zai and other places. The large amount of military supplies previously transported are stored in Xu Zai Ling. Currently, the Japanese are forcing four to five hundred islanders who have not yet evacuated to build roads every day. Any slightest negligence is severely punished. The islanders cannot bear it, and deaths occur every day. In addition, all residents of the island were previously gathered at the airport for population registration. More than sixty people, including Chen A-si, did not comply and were discovered and executed on the spot. This is inhumane and infuriating.</p>
<h3>On the Lu-Xi Line, Our Troops Advance Smoothly, Heavily Defeating the Japanese Army South of Huangtang, and the West River War Turns Quiet Again</h3>
<p>The war on the West River front has turned quiet again recently. Since the Japanese army harassed Huangtang South and other places on the 28th and 29th of last month and was severely attacked by our forces, they have been lurking in one corner for days, not daring to act rashly. In addition, due to the attack by our troops on the northern route, a part of the Japanese troops in Sanshui were transferred to northern Guangdong to reinforce the West River defense. Our guerrillas became even more active. The latest battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Our Troops Advance on the Lu-Xi Highway</p>
<p>On the 29th of last month, the Japanese army in Sanshui attacked Lubao and was counterattacked by our Chen Division in coordination with the Tax Police Regiment. The Japanese left more than two hundred bodies and retreated. Our troops on the Lu-Xi Road took advantage of the victory to recover the strongholds of Qu Cun, Lu Cun, etc., and advanced into Yangmei and Bao Yuetong. The vanguard forces engaged in skirmishes with the Japanese army for days. The Japanese soldiers relied on fortifications and stubbornly resisted, without any changes. Our troops advanced steadily and achieved success step by step. Yesterday (3rd), our Tax Regiment Tea Unit had advanced to Puxin Bridge, more than ten li south of Southwest Town, and attacked the Japanese along the West Road. On the evening of the 3rd, they cooperated with the Ou Unit guerrilla team to raid the Japanese position at Qiaotou at night,摸进摸进摸进摸进×摸进×营, engaging in a mixed battle for an hour before withdrawing. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed that night. The Japanese army was afraid of our attacks and was already terrified.</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Miserable Defeat, Angering the Villagers</p>
<p>It was also found that when the Japanese army in Sanshui attacked Bao the other day, they were severely attacked by our forces. In the Battle of Huangtang, two or three hundred Japanese soldiers were annihilated. The Japanese commander, Major Higashi, was also seriously injured. After the miserable defeat, the Japanese army vented its anger on the villagers, carrying out a large-scale massacre. For days, Japanese troops from the HeKou River sent infantry and cavalry to Kuigang, Shangxia Baitia, Fu Chuan Gang, Bao Gang, and Zhennan New Market to search for able-bodied men, arbitrarily killing or detaining them and returning them to the HeKou River Customs for torture. In addition, the Japanese in Sanshui City and the southwest of HeKou under the pretext of preventing epidemics, in addition to forcibly injecting poisonous needles to our people, also sent so-called "health and epidemic prevention workers" to inspect the health conditions of various shops and households, guiding residents to pay attention to hygiene matters. These shameless traitors took the opportunity to extort and blackmail, and the people hated them to the core.</p>
<p>Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou, Citizens Fleeing in Droves</p>
<p>Our commando teams have repeatedly infiltrated Guangzhou in the past ten days to attack the Japanese. As a result, the Japanese army has imposed martial law, and the atrocities against the remaining citizens have become even more severe. Most of the remaining citizens have already fled. It was found that at 5 pm yesterday, a group of more than fifty refugees, men, women, old and young, dressed in rags and looking pitiful, arrived in Huicheng on foot after a long journey from Guangzhou. Upon hearing the news, the reporter went to inquire about the situation in Guangzhou. According to the refugees, the refugees living in Guangzhou are in extreme suffering under the tyrannical Japanese authorities, coupled with rampant bandits and traitors, rape, murder, and robbery occur every day. All the large and medium-sized shops have been occupied by Japanese merchants. There is no way to make a living in the market except as a small vendor. Recently, the Japanese in Guangzhou have been repeatedly attacked by our air force and guerrilla teams in the suburbs, and they are extremely panicked. They declare martial law day and night, and traffic in the market is prohibited. The situation is extremely chaotic, so we were forced to flee back to the mainland to avoid being left to die in the city. It was found that these refugees all speak Hakka and are mostly from Xingning, Wuhua, Meixian, and other places.</p>
<h3>Unhealthy Atmosphere in Beihai, Rampant Smuggling, and Japanese Goods Filling the Market, Gambling and Spies Flourishing</h3>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Telegram Orders Prohibition</p>
<p>The Fourth War Zone Commander-in-Chief Headquarters previously organized a battlefield delegation led by Lieutenant General Lin Ci-jian, a senator of the Guilin Headquarters, and sent it to various places in northern Guangdong, western Guangdong, and the southern route for inspection. When they arrived in Beihai, they found that smuggling was rampant, Japanese goods were flooding the market, and harmful opium and gambling had not been eradicated. They reported the situation. Yesterday, Acting Commander Zhang telegraphed Deng Shizeng, the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District, ordering him to strictly prohibit it. The original order roughly stated that it was reported that smuggling was rampant in the Beihai area, Japanese goods were flooding the market, opium and gambling were flourishing, and spies were emerging. It has long been strictly prohibited to transport and sell enemy goods and open opium dens and gambling dens. Now that the War of Resistance has reached its most critical stage, and the National Spiritual Mobilization is being vigorously carried out, such evil deeds must be eradicated. It is hereby ordered that you investigate and prohibit it, without any hesitation, and intensify the training of the people to enhance the power of resistance. The handling situation should be reported.</p>
<h3>Prohibited Goods Supplied to the Enemy, Provincial Government Transmits Examination Measures for Goods Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Provincial Government instructed its subordinates to transmit the "Examination Measures for the Transportation of Prohibited Goods Supplied to the Enemy to Shanghai" issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The original text is as follows: (1) The transportation of prohibited goods supplied to the enemy to Shanghai is limited to the scope of the concession. (2) The purpose of transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai is limited to supplying factories in our country or allied countries for procurement or meeting the daily needs of local people. (3) When factories in allied countries purchase various prohibited goods from the inland and transport them to Shanghai, before shipment, the Chamber of Commerce, or trade association, and the Consul of the allied country stationed in Shanghai at the place of shipment shall issue a certificate, stating the purpose of transporting the goods to Shanghai, the name and address of the factory in the allied country, and ensuring that the goods will not be used to supply the enemy or transshipped to other prohibited countries after being transported to Shanghai. (4) When factories in our country purchase various prohibited goods and transport them to Shanghai, before shipment, the Chamber of Commerce or trade association at the place of shipment and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce shall issue a certificate, stating the purpose of transporting the goods to Shanghai, the name and address of the factory purchasing the goods in Shanghai, and ensuring that the goods will not be used to supply the enemy after being transported to Shanghai. (5) The certificates in the preceding two paragraphs shall be submitted to the county and municipal governments at the place of shipment for approval. The county and municipal governments shall report the handling of examinations to the superior government agencies for submission to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record each month. (6) The reporting merchants shall submit the approved certificates in the preceding paragraph to the Customs for inspection and release. (7) The Customs shall submit the quantity and value of the prohibited goods transported to Shanghai each month, together with the original certificates, to the Ministry of Finance for transmission to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. (8) After the prohibited goods supplied to the enemy are transported to Shanghai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce shall be responsible for supervising the sales of the same industry association. If there is any situation of supplying the enemy, in addition to the industry association strictly imposing sanctions according to the association's rules, it shall report to the government for investigation and punishment. (9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Guerrillas Active, Japanese Forcing Young Men to Join Puppet Police, Forcing Villagers to Supply Food and Women</h3>
<p>The Japanese army entrenched in Panyu, recently due to the attacks by our guerrillas and commandos, and the repeated destruction of roads, has recently forced our young men to join the puppet self-defense force, falsely claiming to maintain local security, but in fact, using "Chinese to control Chinese."</p>
<p>Forcibly Conscripting Young Men</p>
<p>The Japanese army entrenched in Panyu recently received orders to transfer a part of its troops to the Foshan and Sanshui areas for reinforcements. With its strength weakened, the commandos and guerrillas lurking in various villages in southern Panyu took the opportunity to attack the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese army could not cope and ordered the puppet county government to forcibly conscript young men from various villages. In addition to assigning them to the puppet self-defense force to prevent our guerrillas, the rest were transferred to the front line to serve as cannon fodder. On the 2nd of this month, the puppet county government issued a notice, under the pretext of recruiting young men to maintain local order, setting a deadline of ten days for each village to pay ten people, otherwise, a fine of one thousand yuan would be imposed. Therefore, the young men in the villages have been fleeing one after another, or joining the guerrillas to attack the Japanese.</p>
<p>Carrying Out Atrocities</p>
<p>It was found that since the Japanese army transferred its troops to the front line, fearing attacks by our guerrillas, the Japanese soldiers left behind sent all troops on patrol and guard along the highways and traffic lines every day. The Japanese soldiers have also been going to the villages in Getang, Kengtou, Xicun, Banggang, and Chayuan to harass, forcing merchants to report the whereabouts of our guerrillas and to pay rice and livestock to supply the Japanese soldiers with food. It was found that every time the Japanese army goes to the villages to extort food, they will inevitably rape and trample on women, occurring several times a day. Therefore, the women in the villages are in great turmoil and fleeing one after another. At present, the people of Panyu are suffering from the Japanese army's瘋狂蹂躪瘋狂蹂躪, and there is no peace.</p>

<h3>Hollywood: The Evolution of the Eight Major Companies</h3>
<p>Paramount Has the Longest History, MGM Has the Most Talent</p>
<p>Hollywood, known as the world's largest film city, is full of many film companies and studios, but in fact, the eight companies with the most capital, the most talent, the richest output, and the most reputation are Paramount, MGM, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Universal, RKO, Columbia, and United Artists. Now, let's describe the evolution of these eight major companies individually.</p>
<p>Paramount</p>
<p>Among the film companies in Hollywood, it has the longest history. It was founded in 1921 by Adolph Zukor. Although the current chairman is Barney Balaban, Zukor still holds the position of manager. Originally, Zukor was a famous fur broker. Who knew that once he joined the film industry, he would become a meritorious member of film history. As for Balaban and Sam Katz, another giant of Paramount, before entering the field of film production, they were two powerful figures engaged in theater work in Chicago. Katz also served as the vice chairman of Loew's Corporation, which manages MGM. In today's film industry, everyone knows that Zukor has superhuman and decisive talents in film production and discovered old stars such as Mary Pickford and Harold Lloyd very early. From its establishment to 1929, Paramount always maintained a reputation for excellent output. However, in the same year, because several big stars were poached by Warner Bros., its performance declined sharply. In 1935, it was reorganized again for some reason, which further hit the entire company. However, in recent years, thanks to the reorganization by William LeBaron, the head of production at the studio, it has regained its past reputation. The current basic actors include Bing Crosby, George Raft, Bob Hope, and Martha Scott.</p>
<p>MGM</p>
<p>It is a large studio formed by the merger of Metro, Goldwyn, and Mayer. It was originally created by Marcus Loew. Previously, all the properties were in the hands of several large theaters and entertainment group hosts. Now, it is completely managed by Loew's Corporation, implementing a division of labor and cooperation system. Loew himself only started working in film production in 1920. Indeed, MGM's output is extraordinary and still holds a leading position today. However, two years ago, the death of the film production leader Irving Thalberg caused the quality of the output to decline once. However, now, thanks to the efforts of the head of the studio and assistant supervisor Louis B. Mayer, it has revived its reputation and reached the level of its past output. It also has a strong lineup, such as Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy, Joan Crawford, Walter Pidgeon, Spencer Tracy, and Mickey Rooney. In addition, there are many authoritative directors and famous screenwriters.</p>
<p>Warner Bros.</p>
<p>When the talkies first came out, it almost went bankrupt. But Warner Bros. determined that the future would be the world of talkies, so it spared no expense to carry out large-scale improvements, unlike other companies that proceeded cautiously step by step. Now, the one that can compete with MGM is Warner Bros. The output of studio leader Hal Wallis and producer Henry Blanke (who used to be Lubitsch's assistant) is enough to compete with the former MGM's Thalberg. The big stars include Paul Muni, Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, James Cagney, and Ann Sheridan. Among them, except for Paul Muni, all were raised by Warner Bros. with great effort.</p>
<p>20th Century Fox</p>
<p>It was originally just a low-level studio, but after the authoritative producer Darryl Zanuck came back, its reputation soared. He was previously a producer at Warner Bros., but due to a misunderstanding between the employer and the employee, he withdrew and joined Joseph Schenck's banner at United Artists. Later, they transferred to 20th Century Fox together. Zanuck initially only wrote scripts for dog stars, but he immediately showed his talent for film production. Now he is a top-notch producer. Today, Fox Corporation is still controlled by the investing bankers. It has Tyrone Power, Loretta Young, Don Ameche, Alice Faye, Shirley Temple, the Ritz Brothers, and Warner Baxter.</p>
<p>Universal</p>
<p>Since being released by Carl Laemmle, it has lived a poor life for several years until it discovered Deanna Durbin. Some say that the company is receiving financial assistance from the British, but it is not known for sure. Nate Blumberg and Cliff Work are the chairman and the chairman of the scriptwriting conference, respectively. They implement a new system. There is no head of production. The output of individuals is co-produced by individuals inviting others to supervise, without the trouble of the head of production participating in opinions.</p>
<p>RKO</p>
<p>Under the management of the Owen Trust Company, it has been reorganized several times. It has also gone through court rulings due to bankruptcy. The current chairman is George Schaefer, and the mastermind of the studio is the young producer Pandro S. Berman. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers gave the company a great boost.</p>
<p>Columbia</p>
<p>It relies entirely on the abilities of the major shareholders Harry Cohn and Jack Cohn. It is able to manufacture good works with very low costs, and it is not easy for economic difficulties to occur. It also hired the famous director Frank Capra. Most of his output is successful and sells well.</p>
<p>United Artists</p>
<p>Like Columbia Pictures, its main business is filming and distributing films. It does not have its own directly managed theaters. It is composed of four giants: Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith. Among them, only Chaplin is still acting in films. The company's achievements depend on three producers: Samuel Goldwyn, Walter Wanger, and David O. Selznick. Especially Goldwyn, who has earned a lot of money for United Artists.</p>

<h3>Women's Army Basketball Tournament, the Shenbao Cup Opens Tonight, Demonstrating Benevolent and Heroic Spirit to Appeal for the Sufferers</h3>
<p>Southwest vs. Zhixing at 7 pm, Zhonghua vs. Huaxiong at 8 pm</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) With the rise of the War of Resistance, the whole country is mobilized. No matter men or women, all have the same hatred for the enemy and are fighting for the survival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The female athletes in the Hong Kong basketball circle are appealing for the sufferers by participating in the Shenbao Cup charity match. With soft hearts and heroic bones, they are worthy of being female heroes.</p>
<p>The charity match opens tonight. All four armies are fully mobilized. The first battle at 7 pm is Southwest vs. Zhixing, and the second battle at 8 pm is Zhonghua vs. Huaxiong.</p>
<p>The Zhixing women's army is mostly composed of former teachers and students of Guangzhou Girls' High School. Everyone's skills are well-known at the time. Tonight's debut will definitely be a爽爽爽的 performance.</p>
<p>Southwest has many rising stars and is full of vigor. As an organization with a pure school name, it participates in this charity event. A benevolent and heroic spirit is highly commendable.</p>
<p>In terms of strength, Zhixing is originally superior to Southwest, and victory is within reach. However, the sisters in Southwest have clearly recognized the significance of this charity match, so they do not focus on winning as a prerequisite. The only goal is to appeal for the sufferers.</p>
<p>The skills of Huaxiong are also not weak, but I am afraid that the coordination is not thorough. It is obviously a distinction between strong and weak to fight against Zhonghua. Zhonghua's victory should be the expected thing.</p>
<p>There are many詐手詐手诈手 in the Zhonghua team, so compared with Zhixing, each has its own merits. The brilliant championship must be contested by these two teams. But who will win depends on the final on the 17th.</p>
<p>Tickets are 50 cents for the lower level and 20 cents for the upper level. The price is reasonable. People who love basketball, don't forget tonight.</p>
<p>The lineups of the four teams are as follows: (Basketball Court Taishui)</p>
<p>(Zhixing Team) Chen Rongtang, Chen Qizhen, Deng Yanhao, Lin Shaoping, Huang Yiru, Wen Weiqiong, Li Baozhen, Sun Yuming, He Defang, Lu Qing, Kuang Xiuzhen, Gu Bimei, Jin Huanxian, Chen Jinchai</p>
<p>(Southwest) He Huanxiang, Qiu Meili, Tang Xingliang, Feng Zhenhua, Zhu Shulan, 羣英 群英, Zhu Zhizhi, Wu Ruixin, Wu Suzhen, Li Chanqing, Ye Peizhen, Zhang Huiying</p>

<h3>Chinese Baseball Team to Battle Mindin Slave Again - Today Marks the Start of the Second Round</h3>
<p>Chinese Team Determined to Avenge Their Defeat, Fierce Competition Expected</p>
<p>(Our Correspondent) The open baseball league, using a double round-robin format, enters its second phase of competition today.</p>
<p>Looking back at the first phase, over ten of the originally scheduled thirty games were postponed due to rain, leaving the championship title undecided.</p>
<p>Analyzing the past records of each team, Yupei performs the best with three wins in three games, full of ambition, staring at the championship title as an immovable goal. Next is China, with two wins and one loss in three games, with great potential. Although their score is currently behind Yupei, the future is long and there are many more games to play, so they must work hard and catch up quickly. With their strong strength, they can certainly establish a dominant position with effort.</p>
<p>Yupei is attracting a lot of attention, and future failures cannot be guaranteed, especially in the match against China. They dare not claim a guaranteed victory. Even when facing other teams, they may encounter difficulties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the future situation will change. However, regarding the championship, China and Yupei still have the highest chances.</p>
<p>As for Nanhua's strength, it was fully revealed in the game against China last week. They have many weaknesses and do not seem to be contenders for the championship. Moreover, the departure of Bao Jiaping and Feng Jingxiang to travel south has greatly affected their future prospects due to the loss of these good players.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Western teams have varying performances and values. When they perform well, they can expect unexpected gains, but when they perform poorly, they will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, they are merely working for others in the championship.</p>
<p>Mindin Slave is also one of the strong teams. So far, their score is equal to that of China. In the first round, they defeated China, which was considered their triumph at the time. China's record was tarnished by this defeat, preventing them from keeping pace with Yupei, which is considered a regret. Therefore, they will always remember the humiliation.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of the second round of competition, and it is also the date for the rematch between China and Mindin Slave. Rivals clashing, a fierce battle is expected. All members of the Chinese team are determined to avenge their defeat and will boost their spirits to strive for victory and feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Recalling the reasons for China's defeat by Mindin Slave last time, it was not because of inferior skills or lack of opportunities. Throughout the entire game, China often had the upper hand. Unfortunately, Chen Lunying's error led to a big mistake, putting them in an irreversible situation, resulting in a惨败 (a disastrous defeat). Even now, thinking back, there is still regret.</p>
<p>After this defeat, China has become aware of its weaknesses and is striving to improve. Furthermore, Hu Guodong, a famous player from Guangzhou Peizheng, has joined the team, so the lineup has been reorganized, with Lunying playing second base and Guodong playing first base. As a result, the defense has been strengthened, as seen in the victory over Nanhua last week.</p>
<p>Mindin Slave's performances in the three previous games have not been satisfactory. Even in the game where they defeated China, they did not make any particularly significant contributions. In the game against Western, they seemed out of form and almost lost. The defeat to Yupei was even more helpless. Therefore, I believe that their strength is still below that of China.</p>
<p>Today, if China can find ways to reduce all errors in defense, use a tight defense to stop Mindin Slave's runners from advancing, and if the pitcher has a good performance, controlling the situation well, avoiding the threat of the opponent's hitters hitting the ball, and implementing quick and meticulous work in catching and tagging, then victory will be in their grasp.</p>
<h3>1944 World Games - Many Countries Request to Host</h3>
<p>[London, 7th Dispatch] The International Olympic Committee held a regular meeting. The main agenda items were the issue of skiing competitions in the 5th Winter World Games and the location for the next World Games.</p>
<p>The 5th Winter World Games were originally scheduled to be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland. However, a dispute arose over whether skiing competitions should be included in the program. The committee has now decided to give Switzerland a final opportunity to agree to the holding of skiing competitions. If Switzerland still does not commit, the original proposal to hold the Winter Games in Switzerland will be canceled and a new location will be selected.</p>
<p>Regarding the venue for the next 1944 Games, representatives from Switzerland, the United States, and Poland all stood up to speak, expressing their willingness to host. The location proposed by the Swiss representative was Lausanne, while the American representative proposed Detroit. In addition, London, Rome, Montreal (Canada), Athens, and Tokyo have also made similar requests. The committee has not yet made a decision on this matter and will make a decision after detailed review. It is generally believed that the requests from Britain and the United States are more promising.</p>
<p>The committee also rejected the inclusion of basketball and handball in the competition program, citing "insufficient time."</p>
<h3>Reading "Draft for the Improvement of Physical Education"</h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>With systematic progress, physical education in schools nationwide can use uniform teaching materials to achieve the same goals. Teachers must not be perfunctory, and students who cannot keep up with the pace may not pass their physical education grade, preventing them from being promoted or graduating. Naturally, they will no longer dare to be negligent. Assessing a school's physical education performance can also avoid the hypocrisy of "small number of athletes winning championships represents a school's physical education achievements." Observing whether all students can keep up with the pace can determine the real achievements of their physical education training. It is a win-win situation, so why not do it?</p>
<p>2.  Promoting Social Sports Must Utilize the Bao-Jia Heads in Townships—The draft includes detailed provisions on promoting social sports, such as increasing and enriching sports facilities, promoting and rewarding sports activities in various sectors, and encouraging subsidies for public sports organizations. However, most of the activities that are rewarded and promoted are voluntary activities by the public. Given the current state of physical training among the Chinese public, only a small minority can organize and engage in sports activities voluntarily. The vast majority of people do not know what exercise is all year round. Some people have opportunities to move their bodies in their daily work, but it is mostly repetitive and focuses on局部 (local/isolated) development. Supplementing with a broader, more comprehensive range of activities is an obvious necessity. Therefore, to truly promote social sports universally and ensure that they are effective, we must start with the majority of people who are not</p>
<p>accustomed to it.</p>
<p>To effectively implement physical education in such a large population and vast area, the prerequisite is, of course, to create a large number of physical education cadres. The simplest, most practical, and most economical way to create such cadres is to train the Bao-Jia heads in various townships. Because the Bao-Jia heads are mostly respected by the public, they spend all day with the people and can implement training work at any time. If the government stipulates that this work is their mandatory responsibility, it may not be necessary to pay them extra salary. Therefore, using them to undertake this work will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. (2)</p>

<h3>Ballpark Anecdotes: Two Ah Qs on the Ballpark</h3>
<p>With the football season over, footballers, except for those on expeditions with their teams, are mostly staying home, waiting to show their skills again next season. Recently, it was heard that Eastern team members Xu Jingcheng, Xu Buyun, Yu Qiaxing, Wu Qixiang, and Nanhua player Fu Zhibin, unwilling to be idle, invited 20 comrades to form an Ah Q small football team. Emulating the attitude described by Mr. Lu Xun, they are not arrogant when winning and not discouraged when losing, focusing entirely on ball skills. They do not participate in championship matches and welcome friendly matches every Sunday afternoon. The mailing address is c/o Zhonghua Bookstore, 40 North Diti Street, Ma Tau Kok, Kowloon.

<h3>Introducing "International Literature"</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>"International Literature" is a book that comprehensively discusses international and Soviet literature at the current stage. It provides a concise and clear analysis of the new situation in international literature after World War I. At the same time, it raises new and important questions at the forefront of the development of modern international literature, points out new directions for future international literature creation, and provides a very refined, detailed, and correct account of Soviet literature at the current stage. It is a compilation of speeches from the First Congress of Soviet Writers in mid-August 1934, including speeches and reports by Shi Tangnuofu, Radek, Fadeyev, Ivanov, Shabanov, and Gorky. The theories throughout the book are generally very logical and it is truly a book worth reading.</p>
<p>Gorky has two speeches here. The first is a report on Soviet literature, and the second is the closing speech of the Writers' Congress. As in other essays, this great figure of world literature left many valuable opinions on world literature, art history, and creative forms in these two speeches. He analyzed the development of the original stage of human art, pointed out the social foundations and social struggles of original art, and from a comprehensive examination and critique of the entire development process of human art, profoundly told us the reasons for the decline and weakness of modern world literature, and pointed out the new future of Soviet literature, pointing out that "Our current era is an era full of great sorrow and tragedy, so we should prepare and learn how to use the wonderful descriptive forms used by ancient tragedians to describe modern tragedy." Regarding these many valuable teachings left by this already deceased giant, we today have a 120,000-fold necessity to draw from and excavate, in order to accumulate our own country's artistic theoretical understanding and cultivate the entire system of our literature.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorky's two reports, there is also a most important speech, namely Radek's report and conclusion on world literature. Although Radek has serious errors in his political understanding and philosophical thinking, in this report and conclusion on world literature, we cannot find any major defects in him. He made profound general observations on the mutual influence of world literature, war, revolution, and Fascism after World War I, analyzed the upward and forward trend of emerging literature and art, and at the same time, in the section "James Joyce or Socialist Realism?" He clarified the distinction between formalism and realism, liquidated the shortcomings of formalism, and pointed out the path of formal creation for emerging realism.</p>
<p>Radek's analysis of the world literary situation is correct. Although as reality progresses to our current day, international literature already has many differences from that time. For example, the emerging Japanese literary and artistic movement that was praised by Radek several times is now suffering from the cruel destruction of the Japanese Fascist military government, and the entire situation of Japanese literature and art has changed today. However, the basic situation in the entire international literature has not yet reached another stage of basic飞 (flight/leap), and there has been no decisive change. Therefore, when we read Radek's report today, it still has its meaning of recognition.</p>
<p>Fadeyev's speech here, "Creating Glorious and Immortal Forms," is also an article with extremely important significance, which can be read in comparison with Radek's opinions on formalism and realism. Fadeyev more precisely and specifically than Radek pointed out the foundation of formal creation, pointed out the essential characteristics of the 动 (dynamic) realistic creative method, and proposed the task of "pursuing new forms" to art criticism. These are all valuable insights that can serve as a 镜 (mirror/example) for our Chinese art criticism today, and are worth learning from. As for Shabanov's speech on "The Far East in Literature," there are simple descriptions of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters. From this, we can see the Soviet writers' concern for Eastern literature, as well as see the depth of their understanding of Chinese literature.</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing is that this lecture did not 锋 (锋 - include) the speeches of the two Chinese representatives. However, in China, which is so weak in books that comprehensively discuss international literature, this one book is worth introducing anyway. Although it is already the speeches of others in 1934, in China, they still have today's significance.</p>
<h3>From Chengdu to Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>Goodbye, Chengdu!</p>
<p>I had been in Chengdu for nine days, asking people everywhere to buy train tickets and find transportation to Xi'an, but nothing came of it. On this day, March 11th, I woke up early, and a feeling of anxiety drove me to the Sichuan Highway Bureau to inquire. The clerk said that there happened to be a bus leaving today, but the tickets were already sold out. He stared at my business card with a look of regret. I exaggeratedly said to him:</p>
<p>"I have a very important matter and must leave for Xi'an immediately. There's absolutely no problem squeezing in one more person on the bus, especially since I don't have any luggage. Please, find a way to make room for me." He scratched his head, hesitated for a moment, and said:</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll call the station to ask if the bus has left yet."</p>
<p>He picked up the phone, connected the line, and asked. The other party said the bus was about to depart. He firmly said to the stationmaster:</p>
<p>"A Mr. Lin has an urgent matter and must get to Xi'an immediately. Please wait for him and save him a seat."</p>
<p>He hung up the phone, turned around, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin! It's done, please hurry to the North Gate Station."</p>
<p>I thanked him and immediately took a car back to the Northwest Film Company on Lantern Street, picked up my small suitcase, and was seen off to the station by Brother Song Kang.</p>
<p>The bus departed at exactly eleven o'clock. It was an open truck, loaded with layers upon layers of luggage. On top of the luggage sat twenty-four passengers: fourteen men, four women, four girls, and two boys. Everyone was crammed together like pigs in a pen. In this situation, the boundaries between men and women were practically erased. Even if you were a beautiful young maiden, you would have to lean against a man's thigh and have a man pressing against your chest. But everyone didn't mind, and instead said:</p>
<p>"We've been waiting for this bus for over a month. It was said to be leaving once, twice, three times, but it never did. We're so lucky that it's finally leaving today..."</p>
<p>From this, one can understand how shockingly difficult transportation in the inland is.</p>
<p>After the bus left the North Station of Chengdu, it headed north, passing through Guanghan, Deyang, and Luojiang. At ten o'clock at night, it finally arrived at the county seat of Mianyang, where we got off the bus to stay overnight. Because our bus left late, many other buses traveling north from Chengdu or south from Hanzhong had already arrived. By the time we arrived, all the inns were full. Our group of twenty-four, plus the driver, made twenty-six in total, and we barely managed to find an inn. I didn't join the others in fighting for a bed; they had all been taken. With the help of the waiter, I finally found a bunk in a stranger's room.</p>
<p>In the morning, I only ate steamed buns worth eight cents and a cup of boiled water. The bus didn't stop for lunch. By this time, it was already ten-thirty at night. I rushed to a restaurant to find something to eat. I ordered two dishes and a soup. The rice was as coarse and black as the rice bran that our villagers used to feed pigs. It was difficult to swallow. I ate a little of the dishes and drank some soup, and my stomach felt full even though it wasn't.</p>
<p>Back at the inn, I took a closer look at my room. It was a small room about ten feet square, with two wooden beds and a blackened white mosquito net. The mattress was made of wheat straw, and there was a black cotton quilt. There were no pillows, chairs, or spittoons. There weren't even any windows. Even during the day, I suspected that blowing out the kerosene lamp would leave you in a pitch-black room. The air was foul. I recalled the grand hotels in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and couldn't help but lament that this place was three or four centuries behind them.</p>
<p>I didn't dare to take off my clothes and went to sleep in my suit. Just as I got into bed, my roommate came back. He was a disheveled-looking rogue. I felt even more uneasy. I didn't close my eyes once that night. At four in the morning, I got up to wait for the bus to continue the journey. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Supplement Writers</h3>
<p>— Luo Ying</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has distributed the concentrated cultural industry throughout the cities of the country, ×××××××××××.</p>
<p>New types of newspapers have sprung up with a sudden momentum; fresh supplements are progressing and growing day by day; and journals, large and small, are also appearing with newly renovated features.</p>
<p>Without the hard work of a group of young fighters, how could this unprecedented new situation have been created?</p>
<p>From many progressive supplements, we can read many mature novels, sketch reports, poems, and literary creations in various departments. Meaningful essays, sketches, and militant theories and essays can especially engage in a normal and relentless struggle against all poisonous ideas and traitorous theories.</p>
<p>What important and complex work!</p>
<p>However, apart from a portion of the work being undertaken by established writers, the majority of it falls on a group of nameless, novice young writers. This young group is either intellectuals who have fled here from various cities or cultural workers who work part-time and write part-time. They squeeze out drops of weak sweat and blood from their threatened lives and constant learning. They helplessly wield their only weapons. They have no desire for fame and no financial gain. In this arduous work where fame is just a supplement writer and profit is just a thousand characters per yuan, they bury their heads in hard work and write tirelessly. Even if stacks of submitted manuscripts are placed in "the place they should go," they can only shrug their shoulders, smile bitterly, and pick up their pens to write again. It is truly, "Great themes sometimes wear out the silkworm, vomiting blood endlessly."</p>
<p>Their spirits are in pain, their materials are lacking, but they do not show any signs of blaming others, like the decadent literati of the past who shouted out desperate calls, like the famous scholars of the past who hummed out infinite grief and indignation. Among these hundreds of nameless authors, they only solidify into a red-hot heart of eternal hatred for the enemy.</p>
<p>They need to intensify their studies, but they never get a glance from the older generation of writers who are willing to give them adequate guidance. They also need to unite to learn from each other and obtain the practical benefits of collective writing, but a relatively sound and universal gathering has not yet been established.</p>
<p>Organizations like literary associations have already emerged. This is just a gathering of writers, with their communication agencies, their symposiums, and their literary journals. To this group of nameless supplement practitioners, no attention or assistance has been given to this day. If someone advocates contacting nameless writers or cultivating young practitioners, is there a better place to find subjects than this vast group of supplement writers?</p>
<p>In order to exert the power of cultural resistance, to carry out the work of spiritual mobilization, to prevent the exhaustion of cultural soldiers, and to produce a large number of cultural reserve forces of all arms, we need to give this group of supplement writers a hopeful eye.</p>
<p>If it is still impossible to form a broad and universal literary gathering, supplement writers must also quickly unite to be competent and happily shoulder the great difficulties of the nation and people, and uncompromisingly cope with the era of storms.</p>
<p>Growing up in a new era where everything emphasizes the collective, a scattered, individualistic attitude to work is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>It is already impossible to cope with the infinite cultural industry with the limited power of compassion, especially during the melee in the national struggle.</p>
<p>Intensifying unity and intensifying learning are measures that every cultural person should take, and supplement writers are no exception.</p>
<p>The habit of making supplement writers omnipotent should be avoided as much as possible. They write about social issues, international reviews, literary creations, and literary theories. May I ask, in the mind of a novice writer who is neither mature nor experienced, how can they fully cope with so many topics? Even if they manage to write them out, they sometimes inevitably write empty, hollow articles that do not grasp the core. If you want to write, it is best to write about "the things you are most familiar with."</p>
<p>The improvement of the treatment of supplement writers involves the treatment of all cultural people, which remains to be resolved by the entire cultural community.</p>
<p>With the great difficulties of the present on our shoulders and the bright road ahead, let us work hard! Young supplement writers, everyone should open up this uncultivated virgin land with determination and resoluteness!</p>
<h3>Quislings on the Line of Death</h3>
<p>— Xiao Hong</p>
<p>After the × people entered Wuhu and established the maintenance committee in the city, they widely publicized: "As long as you get a good citizen certificate here, you can go home and farm and not be harmed by the Japanese army." This precisely hit the sweet spot of the people who had fled, so they rushed home to get a good citizen certificate from the maintenance committee and started being quislings. The Japanese devils used this trick to trap our poor compatriots and then used violence to oppress them at any time:</p>
<p>1.  Obtaining a good citizen certificate - one per person (the certificate contains name, age, occupation, address, and number), worth one dime each, and replaced once a month, costing five cents each time. If lost, it must be declared in the newspaper and signed and stamped by the bailiff or shopkeeper before it can be reissued.</p>
<p>2.  All animals that can help with production (such as cattle and fish eagles) must obtain a guarantee slip to avoid being taken away by the ×. (A cow tag costs fifty cents).</p>
<p>3.  Chickens, pigs... and other livestock are all taken by the Japanese for food, and rice straw is used as horse feed, causing the people to have rice but no straw to burn.</p>
<p>4.  Men are often dragged off to do hard labor, women are dragged off to provide them with ××, and some children are taken away and never heard from again. These are all things that the good citizen certificate cannot protect.</p>
<p>5.  When the Japanese army goes to the countryside, the farmers all run away, and they search the homes for clothes... and other items, and take them back to the local traitors, who ask the owners to pay to redeem them.</p>
<p>Under such oppression, the people often resist, but because their resistance is disorganized, they are still struggling on the line of death.</p>
<p>However, the greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. The people gradually become opposed to the ×, and they concentrate private guns in the countryside and establish volunteer teams, broadsword societies, and other groups, repeatedly confronting the ×. The broadsword society in (Wanchun) ×× Township once killed a platoon leader of the × army. The volunteer team at (Luo Jia) ×× Ferry killed two ×. Then, the volunteer team in (Wuxi) ×× Town seized several ships of ×'s coats and military supplies. These were all events that took place in January of this year. Later, they also established contact with the New Fourth Army like the National Army, so the × panicked. They used traitors to sow discord and undermine the unity of the volunteer teams and broadsword societies. This conspiracy did have a considerable effect because the leaders of those volunteer teams and broadsword societies were a bunch of brave but clueless "masters and young masters" who were too concerned with fame and wealth. They lacked a correct concept of the nation and people and were easily fooled by the ×. They began to swallow each other, resulting in mutual harm. The remnants became the "puppet pacification team" and replaced the "×" in the countryside, thus shifting the people's target and hating this group of "volunteer teams." Sometimes the × would use another trick: on the surface, they would often say they wanted to eliminate the "volunteer teams," but in reality, they were indulging them to do so, making the people suffer even more. During the day, they had to guard against the × coming to inspect, and at night, they were afraid of the "volunteer teams" coming to "guerilla." How can they stand this inhuman life? Why don't they escape this ×× hell? In fact, they are chained to the land.</p>
<p>Compatriots, please do not forget these tens of thousands of compatriots in the occupied areas. They are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, and their anti-Japanese sentiment is quite high. Unfortunately, there is a lack of good leaders to unite this high sentiment and create an iron Great Wall to isolate the × in the cities so that they cannot cross the city walls, and to strike them when there is an opportunity! Brave revolutionaries, go to the occupied areas! As long as there is a crowd, you can survive anywhere. There, not everyone is willing to be a quisling. They are brave anti-Japanese warriors!</p>
<h3>The Fall of a Star</h3>
<p>— Weng Xun</p>
<p>——In Memory of a Fallen Friend on the Battlefield</p>
<p>You, like a shooting star in the sky.</p>
<p>Radiating a light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Then quietly passed away——.</p>
<p>Let sorrow and anger fill our ambition</p>
<p>I remember that night most clearly,</p>
<p>You led us to advance towards the enemy,</p>
<p>You were the first to rush into the enemy's fortress.</p>
<p>You were also the first to fall to the ground, dying there.</p>
<p>"Brothers, don't let any enemy go easily,"</p>
<p>This is your last will and hope.</p>
<p>We tightened our triggers while shedding tears,</p>
<p>Bravely facing forward.</p>
<p>Carrying your body, we advanced;</p>
<p>A tragic song echoed in the night wind;</p>
<p>I occasionally raised my head, and in the sky</p>
<p>I could no longer see the giant star that appeared!</p>
