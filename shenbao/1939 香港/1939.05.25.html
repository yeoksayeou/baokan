<p>社評</p>
<h3>但澤與蘆溝橋</h3>
<p>但澤問題，這幾天極形嚴重，特別是廿一日德國衝擊隊攻擊畢克爾地方的波蘭稅關以後，整個但澤，已經給陷在「山雨欲來」的形勢之中了。</p>
<p>但澤問題並不新鮮。法西斯德國之陰謀奪取但澤，進攻波蘭，不祇是預定的計劃，而且早有數萬兇徒秘密潛入活動，這種活動，還獲得民主國家，尤其是×國的縱容。情形竟有如一九三七年中日戰事爆發前夕的蘆溝橋。因此，當此德國陰謀加緊進攻，而在前日昨簽訂德意軍事同盟之時，當此英法等國認為退讓巳到最後關頭，而宣佈同意與蘇聯成立軍事同盟之時，一般人就要說但澤將是歐洲的蘆溝橋了！</p>
<p>但澤究竟會不會變成歐洲的蘆溝橋呢？雖然還要看看德意尢其是希特勒是否能够懸崖勒馬，雖然還要看看英法尤其是張伯倫是否能够採取眞正維護集體安全，親密聯合蘇聯，但是我們今日已能明白指出的，至少應有下列三點：</p>
<p>第一，德意「防共」協定成立以來，然早已是一種企圖進攻民主和平國家重新分割殖民地以至重新製造世界地圖的軍事同盟，但是若干資本主義國家尤其是×國財政資本家政府，却還幻想希莫之輩當眞能够協力反共，進而聯合英法，組織四强集團，組織反共十字軍，把歐洲的危機轉嫁到紅色的俄羅斯大陸上去。可是，現在不僅已有奧地利，西班牙，捷克，阿爾巴尼亞的血淚的事實，而且希莫兩人且已自動撕去「防共」的面幕，暴露進攻民主和平各國重分世界的野心，宣佈德意軍事同盟的正式签字！於是張伯倫先生等等的幻想是根本粉碎了。</p>
<p>第二，忍辱退讓已到最後關頭，英國廣大民衆，共黨，工黨，自由黨，以至保守黨中許多有遠見的人士，都已覺悟，都將起來，這將是使張伯倫先生不能不改變其政策的最大的力量，英國政府將不能不加强與法美蘇聯團結合作反抗法西斯侵略者了。</p>
<p>第三，國際的形勢正在向壓迫與反攻法西斯侵略者的途徑發展，而法西斯侵略政策的結果，同時又正在引導德意等國的經濟狀况與全體人民走向貧困，黑暗，死亡之路、在這種內外壓力之下，德意等國祇有加緊其投機冒險的步驟，從更新的更大的戰爭中轉移內部的危機和壓倒尙未鞏固與擴大的反侵略綫陣。</p>
<p>但澤市會不會變成歐洲的蘆溝橋，在令日已不是一個主要的問題了！今後的問題，是在於：反侵略陣綫是否能够日益鞏固與發展？卽是要問，英法蘇三國政治車事互助協定是否能够公開成立和認眞執行？而且鑒於目前大戰危機的世界的聯繫性，和「和平不可分割』的眞理，我們還要進一步追問　反侵略陣綫是否能够包括遠東在內而日益鞏固與發展？卽是英美法蘇與中國友誼關係能否有更進一步的鞏固與發展而成立一種互助的組織形式？這些問題的答案、如果是肯定了，那麼，雖然但澤或其他地區有立刻變成歐洲之蘆溝橋的危險，雖然為億萬人士積年憂慮着的二次世界大戰卽將全面爆發（許多人是不肯承認世界大戰早從瀋陽事變與西班牙戰爭爆發時已經展開的事實的），然而，從大處遠處着眼，則我們可以預斷：由於反侵略陣綫之佔有絕對優勢與雄偉的實力，由於侵略者內部的危機與實力的虛弱，由於中國反侵略鬥爭的獲得更大的進展，所以縱使是世界大戰，而那時戰爭的時期可望縮短，戰爭的殘酷性亦可望减少，而人類文化亦可少受許多損害。反之，這些問題的答案，如果是否定了，那麼，縱使目前的戰爭還暫時繼續停留於「局部性的階段，但是侵畧者繼續獲得獎勵的結果，世界前途，眞要不忍亦不堪設想了！</p>
<h3>晉東南抗日根據地的政權（二）</h3>
<p>— 克寒</p>
<p>專署為了解下層行政機構的工作，又組織了一個巡　團，分成幾組，每組三人至五人到名去巡視，以溝通上下意見與精神，改善下級行政機構。</p>
<p>至于人事方面從係到區，更有很好的調整，以五區說　，十三個縣的縣畏，除長　以外，其餘十二個縣都是重要換過的，過去那些貪汚腐化，只知做官不　為民，聞砲聲而張惶的官僚份子，巳逐漸淘汰與洗樹，之而起的是一批赤血忠誠，熱情洋溢的靑年，大多是犧盟的幹才。政府爲了調整人事，還開辦了行政人員的訓練班，專門造就一批政府科長，區長，編村村長的人材。這樣的訓練班，在第五行政區曾　續了五期，個別縣里還自己舉辦了訓練班訓練下級行政人員。</p>
<p>批從未辦過公事的靑年，「公事」並不比他們的前輩　，他們以靑年的熱情，推動了整個政權，把地方行政工作做得活潑緊張，富有生氣，當你從編村的村公所或市鎭的區公所門前行經的時候，你常常可以　見村長或區長的房子裏，黑壓壓的擠滿了一大　人，滿口土腔的熱烈地在爭論着什麼問題。不熟悉晉東南情形的人，準會以爲　們是在吵架，實際上他們是在開村副或編村長的聯席會議，討論一個編村或一個區的地方行政工作。什麼事情解决不了，開個會來大家商量商量，這是靑年地方官的特有作　。</p>
<p>他們不但在工作上很有組織性和規律性，而且在生活方面也很有規律，就縣政府來說　，全體工作人員一律都是五點或六點鐘起來舉行早操，朝會，由縣長領導爬山跑步。有幾次記者因趕路，淸早翻上馬鞍由城里奔駛出來，在城　跟前往往可以聽到一二一的號令聲，縣府的工作人員和人民武裝自衛隊，在一塊草坪上　隊操練。他們又建立了學習生活，每個工作人員須讀報讀書，這幾乎已成為習慣，有一些縣份，每天晚上還一定舉行學習小組討論會。這樣政府一方面是行政機關，一方　又是學習機關。</p>
<p>這樣一批熱中於工作的靑年，和生活過得這樣嚴正，其生活的儉筷和廉潔是不成問題的。他們的統餉已相當地减低，在三區一律待遇是二十元。自然在抗戰期中這樣的薪水也并未算最低。但是較諸過去一個該長月　百數十元，還要貪得各種額外收入，不能不說有天壤之別了。其實這二十元的薪水他們通常抽出一部份來作各種捐欵，如慰勞將士啦，献金啦等等，政府工作人昌總是站在最　面踴躍倡導的。</p>
<p>政府工作人員的廉潔，和政府經費的節約，不但減輕了人民的負担，而且提高了政府在羣衆中的信仰。祇有政府人員生活的儉樸，才能消除人民對政府的成見。</p>
<p>第五個特點，是政府的戰鬥性。在接近×區的地方，這種戰鬥性，特別能充分表現出來，如正太路上的平定，昔陽，同浦綫上的榆次，太谷，洪洞等縣，他們經　在×人句　下生活，有的地方×人住在山下，他們住在山上，有的地方×人件在山上，他們　在山谷，相　不上十里路，而他們能够若無其事的根據地展開他們的　政工作。他們有民衆保護，民衆給他們作偵探，民衆挺進在前固給他們放哨。再如平定，昔陽，和順，遠縣，沁水，浮山，　城等縣，是經當會遭到×人逆襲的，他們能很靈活的迎接×人進攻，×人佔領城，他們　率領當地民衆武裝環繞×人四週打游擊打得×人架不住退出了，他們又能把社會秩序很快安定下來，特別應該指出，這些縣在當初恢復政權的時候，祇有十幾個村能歸他們管轄，而現在我們的政權勢力能擴大到全縣。第六　政區的東路辦事處，還組織了×區工作團。深入×人佔領的城村，作爭政民衆　動搖僞組織的工作。攜帶大批官傳品到×區散發。日本特務機關所組織的愧儡政府，和我們國民政府領導下的抗日政府的政權力量相比較，有天壤之別。難怪偽省長，偽縣長不得不發出「無省可長』，「無縣可長」的哀嗚。</p>
<p>在晉東南腹地的各縣地方政府，在九路圍攻以後，×人還沒有敢嘗試再度挿入晉東南腹地的一個時期，顯得是「建國」的政府，但在這次準備迎接×人新攻的工作中，却還是表現其戰鬥性。當×人佔領導縣，和順後，這里的各縣行政工作員發出一個很有意味的口號：『×人來一次的好，來一次可以把我們的工作作一個攷騐。』他們簡直把×人的進攻作為試卷，×人遲早總要來，好學生决不怕攷試。今天各縣便在積極的佈置他們的戰時工作，他們已經計劃好在×人雙足挿入腹地，縣區面積被分劃成兩塊或三塊的時候，他們怎樣把縣府分開兩個或三個繼續推進行政工作。</p>
<p>以上所述是晉東南政權的特點，也可以說是他的優點。應該說明，這些優點是閻司令長官領導之功，是他頒佈了廢除苛捐雜稅和减租减息的法令，是他不管靑年對行政工作的有無經騐，大胆的提拔和引用靑年到政府機關中來，而且能讓靑年們去放手的幹。但同時又應該說明，直接執行閻司令長官意志的人物，也有極大關係，在　的地區的政權工作，不一定像晉東南開展得這樣有成績。這中間，犧牲救國大同盟和公道團也起着不容忽視的作用。在全山西來說，晉東南恐怕是犧公最大的勢力　，他們幾乎和縣府有　等的權戚，尤其是犧盟，他幾乎沒有一件事情不過問。又因為很多縣長都是　盟出身，他們要受權盟組織的領導，聽從　盟組織的意見。地方行政長官常常還提出犧盟路綫的口號，要其下屬嚴格執行權盟路綫。</p>
<p>但晉東南不能說是百分之百的美滿區域，它還有些缺陷：</p>
<p>第一，在民主政治方面，應該指出的是民選村長有些地區並不一定執行得很正常，有些地方往往不晉村長是好是環，一律聽從民衆改選，以致選出的新村長還不如舊村長，有些地方選舉村長時，往往還有門戶之見，新村長與舊村長對立，甲村與乙村對立，以致相互爭逐，相互排擠，釀成不良的糾紛。也可見賦　民衆民擭，同時還需訓練民衆運用民權。現在，政府機關巳經注意到這一點，其對付　辦法是原則上盡量結予民衆以民主權利，但同時民選村長，必須經政府批准，或者是民衆選舉二三人，而經政府　定。</p>
<p>其次是行政會議還沒有發揮其應有的作用，個別縣里行政會議仍然祇是一個形式，不能充分反映民意和　正發揚人民參政的精神，在最近三，五兩行政區所召開的擴大行政會議裏，特別把這問題强調提出，并且充實了行政會議的組織，以後當有轉變。</p>
<p>第二，是政府構的改革還不澈底，　正府與　警長好了，科長却不一定好，尢其是傳達，號房，政法等等，還常常保留故態，區，村，　之愈是下層，愈是改革不够，這種情形五區比較多些，尢其是比較偏僻的鄉村，就因為下層機　還並不十分健全。使政府和民衆還不能打成一片，使民衆對政府在某些地方，還有關　存在。我們裏切希望，晉東南賢明的地方長官，能够百尺竽頭，更進一步，對行政機構能有更進一步深入的改革。</p>

<h3>贛北線上</h3>
<p>— 范式之</p>
<p>（一）爬城的故事</p>
<p>四月廿五日，高安城已被我某師某團圍住，為了缺乏重兵器，對於緊實的城牆，除了爬城以外，沒有第二個更好的辦法、當日就由排長喻光沂，率領士兵一排準備爬城，團長則站立一旁監視</p>
<p>他們到了北門城邊，這裏的城外為一高地，望起來似乎容易爬些。兄弟們把雲梯輕輕地靠上城牆，守城的×軍絲毫沒有介意，這時喻排長就嬰先爬，冷不防後面有一個，入伍不到四個月的二等兵李文榮，走上來報告排長說：「排長不能爬，我應由來先爬！一排長對他說：「你入伍不到四個月不懂得厲害，應由我先爬。」排長說了，就爬上雲梯，及抵頂，×猛以刺刀刺來，傷喻左臂，喻卽以手溜彈向×擲去，斃×二人，另一×卽開槍射擊，喻被擊斃，滾卜城來。繼上者爲班畏，士兵四，結果被擊四，死。此時我攻擊稍受頓挫，士兵皆觀望不前。一等兵李文榮乃躍上前，將喻排長上所昔木壳槍拿下，直上雲梯，士兵受其激動，不甘落後，相繼上梯者七八人。李文榮將到頂上，就先以一個手溜彈在×機槍掩禮洞口擲入斃×四人。嗣又續以木壳槍向城上遙射，亦傷其三。城上×急開槍向李亂擊結果李眼部左胸部臀部各中一彈，亦滾下城來，當由担架夫抬送野戰醫院療治。</p>
<p>由于他們都知道，怎樣才是最光榮的死。為了中華民族的永生，由于他們這種偉至大的精神的鼓勵，激動和感召。在廿六日上午二時廿分，我軍終于攻佔了高安城。</p>
<p>（二）消耗戰的註解</p>
<p>高安東北約卅里的猪婆大丘，藉堅實碉　固守，我攻二次不下，連長李全龍心裏很煩燥，當天晚上就派了一排弟兄去夜襲。剛剛摸到碉堡附近，正要開始動作，只聽得彭彭彭火油箱壹陣響，×機槍便如連珠般射來，我又掙折五個弟兄，但都奇怪，這火油箱響聲何來，當夜囘去，大家開了個小組會議，研討的結果，知道是×人把火油箱緊在碉堡外約五六丈　的大樹上，箱內繫一木塊以鐵絲通入堡內，警戒一聽到外面稍有動靜，就往來將鐵絲頻頻抽動，箱即彭彭作響，堡內酣睡×寇，即知有所戒備了。我們得出了這個結論，于第二天夜裏就派了一個弟兄，緩緩摸到火油箱旁，輕輕以一繩縛在鐵絲上，手裏拿了繩的另一端，躡足爬到碉堡側下山坡上，這裏是死角。×機槍無論如何打不着。于是把繩子一抽，油箱　了，碉堡內×寇紛紛自睡夢中　醒，黑暗中不管三七廿一，抓住機槍柄賽力往外來囘掃射如此廿分鐘，看者外面沒有動。。姑復睡去。但畢剛剛　去。油箱又　了。于是又起來掃射，如此二次，堡之內的×一夜未克安眠。</p>
<p>第二天×到堡四周巡視，什麼也沒有發現。到夜　依樣又來四次，×明知是我出擊部隊同他們開玩笑，但因在黑夜，不知我軍虛實，不敢出來搜索，于是只是子彈倒霉。霹霹拍打再打了一夜，這襟便兩個晚上沒有安眠了。</p>
<p>第二天，火油箱又響了，×認為仍是這一套把戲，加以精力交憊，遂置之不理，埋頭高臥。火油箱響了二次，不見碉堡內有一點動靜，到第三次，還是沒有，點動靜。時我夜襲軍見巳埋伏四周，就此一湧向前，從雲梯爬上碉堡，將手溜彈自機槍洞口四處擲入，堡之內廿餘×寇，掃數被我殲滅。豬沙大丘就這樣輕快地被我全部佔領。</p>
<p>（三）輝煌的前程</p>
<p>營長吳熙照帶了兩個弟兄，至第一綫去視察陣地，遠遠望見×　三四十名，正向我搜索　．一時也　處可　，營長情急智生，見前面土崗上有一獨立大樹，就攀登樹巓，對他兩個兄弟說，你們可依照我手指定的方向，向×警戒射擊，二弟兄領命而去。　（未完）</p>
<h3>戰時昆明教育</h3>
<p>— 慕逖</p>
<p>【昆明特訊】自從抗戰進入第一階段以後，昆明成為後方重鎭，且亦為西南國際交通路綫的要站，這　介紹一點敎育界的情形，也許為海外讀者所歡迎的罷！</p>
<p>七七蘆溝橋事變後，我國的文化，逐漸內移，先後遷來見明的有：聯大，中山大學，中正醫學院，中央政冶分校，同濟大學，唐山工學院，國立藝專，華中大學等校：一時天南古城，頓為文化之總匯。茲將各大學情形，逐一略誌於後：</p>
<p>國立雲南大學他的前身就是唐繼堯將軍創辦的東陸大學，後來改為省立雲南大學，分文，法，理，工學院及醫學專修科，（連實習四年　業）學生以本省籍爲主，間有少數來自湖南貴州的。去年六月奉敎育部令籌　國立，　熊慶來為籌備主任，至今年一月正式成立。仍由熊氏長校，敎務主任蕭叔玉，秘書畏徐繩祖，訓會委員會主任伍健一，文法學院院長簫叔玉，理學院校長兼，工學院楊季岩，醫學專修科改爲醫學院，院長范秉哲。學生男女兼收。因沿海各省相　淪為游擊戰區，所以　入了許多外來的轉學生及借讀出。同時改組國立以後，程度是相當的提高，故添辦先修科（等於大學預科）及補習班，以便省內各中學的畢業生，在學程上得到啣接。最近該校奉敎育部令，派設採礦專修科，抬收高中畢業學生，修業期限二以年；備開發地下的富　，但負起長期抗戰的供應。二月中旬校方請湯惠蓀先生籌設農學院，本省有五六個高初級農校，將來此項劃計實現以後，農　學生又添了升學機會。</p>
<p>國立西南聯合大學終校為北大，淸華，南開三大學所合組。仙們每一個在過去，都有光榮的歷史，合組後先遷湖南長沙，繼於去年三月遷至昆明。由蔣夢贛，梅貽琦，張伯苓（張先生係國民參政會副議長，常川駐渝，故由黃鈺生代坤。）分任校委，以下設秘　等十處，秘書長楊振聲，敎務長沈履，總務長　際昌，建設長黃鈺生，文學院憑友蘭，法商學院陳序經，理學院吳有訓，工學院施嘉煬，師範學院黃鈺生，圖書館主任袁同禮。學生有二千餘人，借昆華農校全部新建築作校本部，敎室宿舍　不敷分配，又借昆華中學，昆華師範，昆華了校等校應用。好在本省各校，大抵　敎育廳令，辟免空襲，疏散至各州縣，所以不成問題。最近農校要收囘自用，此事頗費該校負責人員的躊躇，故現已着手建築新校舍，廢新年，該校話劇團公　「祖國」　幕劇，為前絲將士募集鞋襪，成績很好，凈餘一千餘元．「祖國」的導演是陳鈴敎授，主角是鳳子女士，他們都是劇壇名宿。</p>
<p>國立中山大學該校創設於民國十三年，俘鄒海濱先生長校，民國廿六年擴充為文，法，理，工，農，醫，師範等七院，去年十月廣州失經桂　滇復課，由事務長鄒卓，然來滇接洽，現已選定臨時校址於贛江敎授已抵滇者有百餘人，上年度大學部學生有二千三百人，加入今年新生共計二千八百人，現正　續來滇，最後一批已於十二日　　昆明，在市區租用慶工校作爲臨時校舍，以便接洽遄赴徵江報到上課。</p>
<p>國立中正醫學院該院係國立醫科專門，民國二十五年十一月由江西省政府劃建築基地五百餘畝，建築費六十餘萬，為時一年，始告落成。為紀念蔣委員長治贛之殊勛，故以『中正』名之。於民國廿六年九月開課，共有學生二百二十人，現到滇學生男八十五人，女三十一人暫借基督敎靑年會敎室上課，頃已在昆明城郊，建　適合戰時需要的經濟校舍。（建築材料大部份用泥土）該校創辦宗旨，與一般醫科人學不同。修學期間五年，畢業後即為推行公醫制度的幹部人員，因爲現下的醫枓大抵六七年畢業畢業以後，未必盡爲社會服務，甚至設立私人診所，取費昂貴，貧民見而却步。公醫制度就是醫科學業生，都應爲國家社會服務，解除一般人民的疾病痛苦，以朋在保健上不再有階級的歧視。院長係王子玕，曾任長沙湘雅醫院院長有年。</p>
<p>中央政治學校分校該校設大理，去年派湯惠蓀敎授來滇籌備，後因湯君調往羣西墾殖公司主持業務，遂由汪懋祖敎授負責籌備。現選定校址於大理，以期邊遠學子，有讀書機會，本學期招牧初級生，已開始上課，高級部學住，正在籌備招收中。</p>
<p>國立同濟大學該校初期由德人創辦，名同濟學校，分醫工兩科。至民國十六年正式改為國立同濟大學，由政府撥劃常年經費。繼後勞働大畢奉令合併該校為附　工業職業學校，並又增設附屬中學。八三後奉部令遷浙江金華，繼遷昆明，現有學生九百餘人。校長翁之龍，秘書長章兆直，陳紹賢，敎務長唐美，醫學院長寧譽，理學院王保仁，工　院吳之漢，附屬職業學校唐美，附中主任馮承值，敎職員約二百五十人。理工兩院已在富春初中上，課醫學院設金碧公園，實習醫院係省立昆華醫院。</p>
<p>國立唐山工學院該院係國立交通大學研究院之一，創辦於遜淸，至今已有三十四年之歷史。該院以前敎學，偏重士木採冶。後因抗戰關係，乃將土木工程系移往湖南，與交通大學之鐵道管理學院合併，成立鐵道管理處。其除部份至去年三月，始全部遷湘。樅因湘省仍迫近前線，乃奉部令於同年十一月十四日遷滇。負責籌備人羅忠忱，李裴，葉家垣三君設辦事　於昆明三棟樹　，選定校址於玉溪。該校歷年畢業生有二十八班，共二千餘人。現在大部份在滇緬，叙昆兩路服務，貢献甚大。在　學生四班，共四百餘人，男女同學，院長茅以舁。</p>
<p>國立藝術專門學校該校由杭州，北平兩國立藝專合併而成。去年遷至湖南浣陵，後曾一度改祖，兩校原任校長林風眠，趙畸，先後去職。部派滕固任校長，對原有科系，加以擴充調整，計分專門部純藝術，應用藝術，及高級藝術職業學校等三部。由書家常書鴻，雕刻家王子雲，分任主任。純藝術分為繪畫，雕塑，建築，版畫，四科，應用藝術分為工藝美術，及染織圖案兩科。至高級藝術職業學校則利用各科設備，分別設立實用技術專修班，該校學生約三百餘人，敎職員三十餘人，均已陸續到滇，選定祿豐爲校址，駐昆朋辦事處，設金牛街一一二號。</p>
<p>華中大學該校成立於民國二十年係由文華，雅禮，湖濱，博文四大學合組而成，為英美敎會合辦，本設武昌，繼因抗戰關係，南遷桂林，近以桂林空襲緊張，乃趁學期結　，遷滇復課，現有學生三百人，已陸續由龍州轉滇越鐵路來省，校址大理或喜洲，尙未完全决定，分文理敎育二院，校長草卓民，理學院卡彭年，文學院校長兼敎育學院胡毅，現於金碧路錫安聖堂內，設臨時辦事處。</p>
<p>高等敎育的情形，巳如上述，至於軍事學校與國防有關，應守秘密，姑從略。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>關於國際聯盟</h3>
<p>我國出席國聯代表顧維鈞，向大會提議五點：（一）財政援助中國；（二）勿以軍需品供給日本；（三）限制日貨輸入；（四）設立一調整委員會處理上述事務，　他種對日制裁事宜（五）設立一委員會，調查日本濫炸中國平民眞相</p>
<p>這五點是今日一切民主和平國家的責任，也是他們力所能做的。為了保　中國領土主權，也爲了民主和平國家本身的安全。</p>
<p>我們對於目前的國聯，固然不能存何奢望，，國聯在世界人士中間的威信更日落千丈。然而國聯在今日畢竟還是唯一維護國聯正義和平秩序的現存的國際組織，通過了國聯的一切號召，自然更容易為全世界民主和平國家及和平正義人士所接納與執行。</p>
<p>所以我們雖然不敢贊同那種依賴國聯的所謂國聯絡綫論者，但是我們更須指出一切過分輕視以至咒駡國聯的論調。我們對於顧維鈞代表之提出五點要求與發表激昂演詞，應該加以熱誠的擁護。</p>
<p>現據日內瓦電，國聯行政院仕三日開會，起草答復我顧代表提案的决議書，將重行肯定國聯勸令各會員國對我國抗戰給予實際的援助。這種决議當在我們意料之中的！我們不僅不應該指出那些悲觀論者和咒駡國聯之毫無根據，而且應該謹向起草委員英法蘇拉四國代表致敬。</p>
<p>我們今後更應根據這種决議，和顧代表听提的五點，要求各國人士各地輿論界動各國政府，切實認眞的執行！我們要以我國內部親密合作推進政治發展經濟堅持抗　的事實，擴大國際宣傳，來爭更多更大的外友。</p>
<h3>汪精衛夫婦飛日</h3>
<p>廿三日中央社已經發表關於汪精衛陳璧君於本月五日飛日的消息。這種早在前幾天各地報章騰傳的汪×至日的消息，大可互相印證。我們在這種更可以看出汪的一切言論的背景究竟是什麼—過去還有過分信任　愛惜汪氏的少數人士，日夜希望汪氏之終能不負國人期望，甚至極力將汪的言論從好的方面加以解說，但現在也應該喟然長嘆先聖之言不錯吧：『今吾之於人也。聞其言而視其行』了吧！其實，他的言論中，又何處不洩　　尾！</p>
<p>從中央社宣布的消息中，我們史可看到陳公博氏有不贊成汪氏　××而擬脫離與汪關係的傳說，在尙無事實可證之先，我們固然不能逕下斷言，但是汪之所為不僅有違黨國大計與危害國家民埃並且亦復大違『中國人之道德』，平日謨從汪氏之徒，豈乏明哲自愛之士？其亦能稍感中央數月來的徵意與全民衆最後的期望而反正來歸嗎？</p>
<p>日×擾華，巳遭遇新的不能解救的困難，觀於日幣最近之狂跌，亦可想見其一斑。他們現正企圖加緊佔領地的刦奪與壓迫工作，而要實現此點，首在樹立一個較為有力的僞政權。因此，汪氏尙能為日×今日最適當的工具。汪氏今後的活動，還要大家加以嚴密的視監才好！</p>

<h3>〔連環圖〕在港九街頭</h3>
<p>— 育萬</p>
<p>下層社會……他們的精神食糧鬧饑荒</p>
<p>是幼夏的街頭，是勞苦大案在一層二三十人還滿了的樓宇中透不過氣的時候。晚飯完了，街頭裏的一片木屐聲，雖然填不住氣車的摩托底在聒，然而，都市的動旅，在這晚　初拂的當兒是跳盪得最厲害的：上環中環，上山落山，新界九龍，熙來攘往，這，何者不是光油油的汽車？然而皆管下的勞苦大案，他們拖了木屐，袒着胸膛，他們沒有揮金如土的福分了，他們躑躅街頭，他們除了喝二個銅板的「凉茶」而外，他們便得靠近牆邊，去閱讀「連環園」。</p>
<p>在一抹斜陽的摟角裏，或里衛前面，將會看到的：一座三五尺高的木架，幾隻牛奶的空箱子：木架裏有的或許是「盡」有的則祇是『偽裝』的書底封面罷了。牛奶空箱裏，那便滿是一冊一冊的了。封面，雖沒有圖案的設計，但顏色總算複　的——黃裝綠的：梁山伯祝英台，紫設杯，天奇吿狀，火燒紅運寺，武松打虎，唐僧取經，七創十三俠，姜太公八十遇文王，馬介甫，包公奇案，玉面狐狸……摩登點的，有美女換江山，貂蟬，鍾無艷，六十年後上海　，楚霸王，阿木林……所謂摩登也者，或許就是和最近的影片有關吧—說漂亮些，這百數十冊書，幾乎是街頭小圓畫館，他們擺下了十來張高不及五寸，長可一尺的小木凳，座上客常滿，不論男女老少，縱然是不識字的，也偃仰着，踞着，在一頁一頁地翻。黃昏過了，看書人雖然稍疏，但聚精會神，埋頭埋腦地一冊一冊，上卷下卷地追下去的還是不少。</p>
<p>瓦斯證照澈了整個書攤的觀衆——他們，從眉頭裏表露出「打抱不平」的姿態，從唇沫中表露出「神仙眷屬』的笑容！『苦盡甘來』『寃寃相報』，他們在體會了；他們在資本主義剝刮中掙扎了半生，他們手胝足胼了，他們還懸想着『苦盡甘來』—他們也許要反抗命運了，但他們怕的是「報應』的來臨。</p>
<p>瀏覽運環圖的人，尤其是沉醉的小孩子。早上，成人們要做工，小書攤前，是孩子的世界了——上午六七時吧！看到的或許全是八九歲至十五六歲的小孩子，其中也有小學生，蟻一般　緊着，矮凳擠不下了，木箱子，甚而書包也坐滿了。一仙賃四本，一仙賃八八本，新出的（其實新運來的）則一仙二本，他他們從媽媽的腰包里挖來的綫，像納稅一般繳光了，小學生，他們運果餌筆墨錢也會有來看這迷人的盡。</p>
<p>去年，本港傳來了一段新聞，有士二三歲的小　三人，偷偷的離開那可愛的家，相約求仙去，結果，徒北攀山，首先鼓起了勇氣，擬步行穿過廣九鐵路的遂道……後來，卒被家人發覺了而加以戲阻，這是『七劍十三俠』的思賜了—他們，有魯濱孫的精神，但他們缺乏了童子軍的訓練，他們平日接觸的祇是離奇誡誔的連環圖！</p>
<p>幾年前，本來就有人發起要改良連環圖，而已經出版的也頗不少。可惜坊問所見到的，幾年來還是寥若晨星！而街頭巷尾的神怪連環圖，仍汗牛充梀！抗戰中的文化人，誰都應該站牢自己的崗位來呀！我們不但要改良這封建的，陳寫的連環圖：而日要如何去使它配合『抗戰』—有是有的，像通俗讀物編輯社出版的「大衆讀物」，大衆藝術出版社出版的「連續故事」等；然而，杯水車　，何濟于事呢？　說街頭的連環圖書，其目錄逾萬種，就五千種，其深入人心，何異於洪水猛獸？</p>
<p>角裏的大衆，亟待敎導，矮凳裏的小孩子，是民族的一條新底生命！然而瓦斯燈下，晨光影一，我們所見到的，終始是被迷　的一羣！</p>

<h3>獻辭</h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>今天能和諸位在香港見面，我們感到難以言说的欣喜。</p>
<p>兩年來，在烽火中的祖國走過了很多的城市和鄕村。每天在轟炸中，在×人的大炮中，和無數萬英勇的弟兄們和苦鬥着的民衆們生活在一起。如果說，我們的工作是在敎育士兵和民衆，倒不如說民衆和英勇的士兵在敎育我們。</p>
<p>在戰爭中工作了廿個月，我們感到我們自己的力量的微弱，時時想對祖國有更多一點貢獻，因此便有出國宣傳的决定。</p>
<p>現在因路過香港，得有一個　會，使我們很視地把從戰地帶來的幾個戲，搬上了舞台，在舞台各方面的技術上，我們還是一個初學走路的孩子，似的，極待港地觀衆諸君給我們以指導，使我們更多的得着學習。這些戲在前方，我們會以平地，高山，壕溝，麥田作為臨時舞台，將它演出，而數百萬英勇戰士，便是我們最親愛的觀衆，他們灌注全力，細細地聆聽劇中人的話語，當時，大地肅靜極了，感到了一種精神上的溝通，×機來了大家一同臥倒，×機去了，又繼續我們的演戲，有一次，在河南商城，我們演以軍民合作為主閥的『當佚了去！』招待卽要開赴火線的　治安將軍一師隊伍，在一個大的露天廣場上，弟兄們都整齊輪坐任地上，戲演到一半，天忽然陰雨着了，越下越大，當時我們和該師一位官長商議，為了免弟兄們淋雨，願意明天走卅里路到兵營里去重演當官長站在高地上問「救亡劇團同志們，怕我們弟兄淋雨，願明天到我們兵營里去重演，現在囘去不回去？』『不同去！』這是弟兄們洪亮地回答。『我們看下去！』又是第二次洪亮的喊聲。我們被這聲音激動着，每个人拚着合力在台上演，弟兄們沒有雨具，不動地，嚴謹地在大雨里看了兩鐘點的戲，當他們整　隊伍囘去時，齊唱着「同胞被屠殺，土地破强佔！」的歌，這歌聲使我們感動得流淚，更使我們覺得自己的工作熱忱以及努力不够。在一些窮鄉僻壞的內地里，那些純樸而天眞的農民們不分男女老幼，是怎樣地在熱愛着我們時，我們覺得從沒來有被觀眾們這樣熱愛過，在大別山時，農瓦們從四五十里地外，扶老幼，背着米糧來看我們的戲，看元了，便在戲台旁煮飯吃，晚間便睡在木板搭成的戲台下，第二天　繼續地看，常常以幾碗粗茶，幾枚鷄蛋，表示他們對我們的熱誠，我們覺得這些此什麼史可貴，更能給我們鼓勵和慰安。</p>
<p>曾經有好幾次，我們在人轟炸中，差一點兒犧牲了。在徐州。尤其在宋埠。×機轟炸的目標離戲台只有川米達，結果是犧牲了一個勇敢的戲劇工作者，我們團體一人受傷，但沒有多久便機續演了。</p>
<p>我們不久就要到海外去工作了，金那些千萬顆心維繫着組國的僑胞前，伸着我們的手，吿訴他們祖國在戰鬥——戰鬥到底，勝利是我們的。</p>
<p>在港短時期的勾留裏，能有一個機會，使我們替香港各界賑聯會籌款，為救濟傷兵難民盡一些微力，覺得十分高興，同時。我仍相信港地的觀衆也定給我們以莫大的鼓勵的，</p>
<p>文化界，戲劇界，許多方人們，給我們工作上許多鼓勵和指示，敬在這兒致最　的謝！</p>
<p>在一次歡里中國救亡劇團的座談會上，見到了這一隊身經百戰的戲劇士。在們他將近兩年的，流亡轉屣的堅苦工作中，我沒有同他們在前方遇到，也沒有在後方遇到，而是當他們出國宣傳的時候，經過這個充滿安逸氣息的杳港，而在工作上是沒有獲得一點成績的我，才和他們遇到了。在這種情形下，金山先生還要代表救亡劇團向留港的工作者致敬，主席也希望我能够說一點甚麽，那時候正像有一根　利的芒刺，突然刺在我的背上，一種極度慚愧的感覺，使我抑制不住心臓加緊的跳動，急促的呼吸，而　乎變成了一個啞子。我覺得除了聽取敎訓之外，我所有的話都說不出，而且不必要再說了。這一根芒刺一直留在我的背上，惟有邁大了我的步子，加緊了我的工作，假如我能够追隨在這一隊戰士的後面，也許還有拔除的希望；否則，我要是放棄責任了，落任了，那麽，它必將永遠留在我的背上，以孕直刺心窩，而成『不治』的『絕症』！</p>
<p>假如我還有勇氣說甚麽，我只有喊出：中華民族解放自由萬歲！中國救亡劇團的戰鬥精神萬歲！但我不再喊中國救亡劇團萬歲，因為我們的戰鬥固然是不斷地，但我堅决的相信，最後勝利就在眼前，到那時，我們將要為建新的中國而戰鬥，而不是再為「救亡」而戰鬥了。</p>
<p>從使人興　而也過度疲倦的忙逼的工作中抬起唱來，實在　不出應該禽些什麽才最適當。但願『中救』這　的　出，能給予香港的同胞們多知道一些『芒刺』的不好忍受，而對祖國的危難多　予以一些注意。年祖負起一些責任，而以『中救』的戰鬥精神為精神，才不辜負為一個中華　好兒女！</p>
<p>末了，再護我高呼：</p>
<p>『中救』的戰鬥精神萬歲！</p>
<h3>民族萬歲！中救萬歲！　獻給中救的在港公演</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>在香港戲劇界剛剛聯演完『黃花崗』之後，中國救亡劇團趨尙未出國的時候，上演『民挨萬歲』，『保衛組國』，和『合兒莊之春』，為香港各界賑聯會籌欵，賑　傷兵難民，這正意味着：戲劇工作正在充實統一戰綫，把自己的工作，配合抗戰的要求，服務民族解放的勝利利——這服務抗戰的劇逐，正在日益擴大和深刻化着。</p>
<p>中救的各同志，在戲劇的數量上，早已承認並建立了光榮的傳統，八一三以後，有着萬里以上的長征，敎育大衆同時大衆學習，揚棄了以前在大都市的上演方式，應用他們對戲劇的智識，技術的Mastery，把活牛生，血淋淋的現實通過集體的正確的理解，把它賦與　新形式，有機地做成了抗戰的一部分，不可分離，不可缺少的一部份。這個工作歷程，是使他們成為銅鐵隊伍的，也是這個工作歷程，使他們值得一般戲劇工作者的敬慕與學習。</p>
<p>中救這次上演的戲，是為了都市的觀衆，不只在內容上是選擇了精粹的作品，卽在技術上，也足以使一般對於戲劇還未了解的觀衆，極其愛好，而竟成為抗戰戲劇的擁護者的。所以這一次的公演，不只加强了抗戰的宣傳，不只服務了傷兵難民，同時擴展了戲劇感效與影響的領域，使更多的人都確切深刻地覺到救亡是每一個中國人的責任。</p>
<p>在中救的工作曆程中，有許多地方可以供留港戲劇界參玫和學習的：嚴肅的生活，不斷的自我敎育，刻苦耐勞的工作，和把一切努力　給新中國的建立的鬥爭精神！</p>

<h3>金山的期望</h3>
<p>— 罗秋</p>
<p>時代是水綏向前躍進的，時代的警鐘們在斷我也小的耳跟在敲，時代是不『腐化』存在的，因為『腐化』會阻掣時代的進行。中國今日，是臨到復興的偉大的時代了，同時也是到危險的可怕的時代了。然而我們是不肯讓中國沉淪的，相反地，我們將極力支援，支援祖國的光榮的最後勝利。我們　戲劇—作者，在今日，是應該怎么樣忠誠，怎樣純潔，去從事抗戰戲劇的廣泛促進，廣泛開展。</p>
<p>作為抗戰話劇的一枝新電——中國救亡劇團，我們期待它，正如期待抗戰勝利一樣，誰都知道這一枝新軍，是從國內來的，正團長是金山先生，　團長是王瑩先生，還有一位軍事專家林樞先生。</p>
<p>金山先生的第一句話是『中國救亡劇團到海外，是把城內的許許多多的抗戰事實，充份介紹給僑胞知道，使僑胞認識抗戰是必勝的，中國是一定有辦法的』，所以中救劇團對于一個劇本，一個脚色，都加以非常嚴格非認真的訓練，每一坎演劇以後，請林樞將軍將抗戰的軍事形勢，　治形勢詳細地澈底地作系統的解釋。同時，放映抗戰影片，展覽抗戰照片，這火一樣的熱情，金山先生在幾次招待會上痛　地向入家解釋過。</p>
<p>金山先生的第二句話是：『我們好是文化哨兵，我們出國之後，許許多多　情，希望國內的，香港的文化同志，給我們作後盾，給我們多多指示』。是的，中救劇團不特是文化的哨兵在而且超過哨兵以上。我們稱他們的文化前　，我們希望他們做前打得勝利。一，我們的　劇，得向國外發展開去，擴大起來；二使，我們的僑胞，更多知道祖國，更多捐錢。××××××，眞至最後勝利而後止，我們對于金山先生的謙遜客氣，是起敬的。我們沒有說，我願在香港時刻不忘救亡劇團的好消息。</p>
<p>金山先生的第三句話是：『我們先去南洋，後到星加坡，再去美洲一帶，我們希望在途中不斷聽到勝利的消息』。金先生一方努力，一方念，身雖在海外，而心却即實祖國，這種戰鬥的精神，　底的愛好，會使逃跑的，降×的，××××××××××慚愧而死！金山先生努力進擊，祖國一定　利的，祖國一定會從苦鬥中翻身起來！</p>
<p>金山先生所領導的中國救亡劇團，在港上演　將，中國外，在本港我　薦他們給本港人。要是看話劇遠得中救的劇。這是忠實的，非商品式的眞正藝術，而貫　到抗戰問題，是有百分之百的事實的。</p>

<h3>『中救』在戲劇戰線上</h3>
<p>— 明希</p>
<p>克服困難，需要以强的毅力。造成這堅强毅力的是向上的，樂觀的，不失望的精神，這種精神則是由於我們有了牢不可破的信心，那信心就是『中國不亡』『最後勝利必屬於我』。二十個月以來，中國救亡劇團是克服了一切困難，在抗戰中學習，在抗戰中鍛鍊，在抗戰中成長壯大起來，同時使他們的武器——戲劇，在救亡工作中發揮了最大的效能，這可說是互為因果的。</p>
<p>×人之圖我，無微不至，無所不用其極，假如我們嬰和×人做一次總淸算，假如這一次抗戰就是當然的淸算時期，而執行這秤淸算工作的人，絕不是單純的，散亡漫的組織所能為力了。而戲劇之普遍的演出，也絕救不冉如舊日都市演出的方式所能發揮其偉大的作用了。必需有紀律的組織，才能完成預期的任務，我們還可以記得。『八一三』以後先後出發若干的救亡演劇隊，現在還有幾個單獨的存在，我不是說那些不存在的團體是失去了他們作戰的力量，不過是在表明這個由救亡演劇隊進展而成的中國救亡劇團之繼續存在，而且能够逐漸的成長起來，絕非偶然，乃是必然的。</p>
<p>舊日都市演劇的團體總不免是散漫的，短時期的，而個人的生活則不免習於藝人的浪漫，甚至風頭和玩票的思想也未甯不參雜其間。還在輾轉搏鬭於戲劇戰線上的團體或個人，是絕對要不得，而也自然地沒有存在的可能了。他們雖然不完全和軍隊一樣，但中少是相近的——嚴密的組織，紀律的生活，融洽的情感，深切的認識。舊的東西不足以應付環境了，新的東西會不斷地學習得來，這無窮的經騐，才是持久戰寳質的火藥庫。『中救』一面在他鬥，一面在繼續充實他們的火藥庫。經騐上的火藥是沒有消耗只有增長的。</p>
<p>我見到了中救的工作者，樸實與健壯，是我得到的印象。我聽到了他們的談話，誠懇與經驗的豐富是我得到的印象。我知到了他們的組織和生活，我將要看見的演戲，我將要得到無窮的印象，無窮滿意的印象。不可磨滅的印象，但我們不能忘記，『中救』這次演戲，是他們出國宣　的準備，是他們因時因地而運用一種新的戰略那幾千元的佈景服裝絕不是浪費，他們是要充份運用它來獲得預期的效果。在鄕村演劇和都市的演出不同，換言之，也就是在都市演劇不能冉運用鄕村演劇的方式，不過為了『救亡』這個目標而工作則是一致地。</p>
<p>在辛勞，困難，危隊，艱苦，包園下生活和工作，不僅是在和××人搏鬥，也正是和這些困舌搏鬥，二十個月成接　來的中救是勝利了。他們沒有得到甚麽報酧，但，真的沒有嗎？有的，祖國的自由　萬萬五千萬同胞的自由，將是每個在戰上線工作者所得到的報酬。</p>
<h3>在排演中見到的</h3>
<p>— 林樞</p>
<p>擺在觀衆面前的，是慘絕人寰的×人的殘暴行為：是動天地而泣鬼神的中華兒女的反抗運動，一方面表現着世界的燬滅，一方面表現着人類的曙允；兩　絕對相反的勢力在鬥爭，我為了，我要為死難的同胞流淚，但我絕不肯流淚，我寧可多流幾次血，把這些惡魔一起掃光，這是我一次看台兒莊之戰後的感覽。</p>
<p>个人的力力終是有限；把个人的力量放在團體裏頭去使用，才會發生偉大的效果，魏大鵬縱是一个英雄，也不免要依賴羣衆的力量，才能够在死裏求生，才能够為國家民族吐出一口氣，這是我們民族萬歲排演時的一个印象。</p>
<p>年靑的人，實在可愛，他們的血多麽熱，心地多麽坦白，國家觀念，民族意識，多麽濃厚，我自參有了中國救亡劇團看到全體同志，連夜不睡覺，有時運飯都不吃，拚命地準備這一次的演出，使我倒覺得慚愧，我們在火綫一次兩次的流血　是絕比不上他們時時刻刻在各處流汗的貢献大，我雖沒加他們演劇的天才，也得搖旗吶喊，充當一名小卒才行。</p>
<h3>中國救亡劇團義演幾個偉大名劇的介紹</h3>
<p>中國救亡劇團十個月來輾轉南北戰場，感動了千千萬萬軍民。現在出國傳宣過港，香港各界賑聯會因為崇仰劇團的國防藝術，及籌款救濟難民　兵請見，特敦邀他們舉行一次大規模的義演，就在今（廿五日）特起在利舞台一連三晚公演了。</p>
<p>這次中國救亡劇團上演的三個劇目中，包含了二個五幕劇，和四個獨幕劇，兩個五　劇，是『民族萬歲』和『台兒莊之春』四個獨幕劇，是『賊』「死裏求生」『鬼夜哭』『逃難到香港』，因為這四個劇，都是一連串的抗戰故事，所以又合併了一個劇名，『保衛祖國』</p>
<p>『民族萬歲』是　材於東北人民的自衛鬥爭，×人存東北的暴行，激起了廣大的憤慨，於是在中秋節的月夜，舉行起義，一夜之間，盡鐵兇逆，報復了亡國亡家的　痛，這是一個五幕劇中間　穿挿了不少複雜的情節，漢奸的女兒，鼓動偽軍反正，農民領袖深夜計議，歃血　盟，這是一個非常有深刻意發敎育了我們實際鬥爭經驗的故事。</p>
<p>『台兒莊之春一是魯南血戰的　錄，完全是根據歷史寫成的這戰役的眞史價，已經　衆所周知的事，無須多所說明，而我們所希望的，到是我們應該怎樣來學習這種偉大的精神繼續抗戰這裏充分表明了軍民合作的親密，和一種崇高的英粵衛國的精神，使我們深深地受到感動。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，使人興奮的故事太多了，而保衛祖國，却是精練了這些故事，而編成功的，『賊　是諷刺劇，寫死求生』是說一個公止紳士為了要保全游擊隊的秘密，竟　死了自己的愛子，但一個險毒的特務機關，畢竟，的智急下被殲滅了『鬼夜哭』係描寫×人轟炸的慘酷在使人民間泯滅人鬼之分，逃難到香港一是說一對從東北逃亡出來的父女，但傳們的路定錯了，他們幾乎忘記了誰在鞭撻　他們的生活，幸而後來得到了指示，×××××××××××，使他們重新走上了光明大這道，四个獨幕劇。雖不是站着一貫的情節，發一个共通的特點，就是却有血，有肉的在抗戰中爆發出來的火花！</p>
<h3>學習『中救』！</h3>
<p>— 朗潘</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，產生在抗戰的洪流中，轉　於前綫後言國內海外，為持久抗戰而服務，不祗是中華民族解放運動中的文化先鋒，而且是民埃革命戰鬥中戰士與民衆的教育者組織者。同時還在全國一切救亡劇團和文化團　　發生其模範的領導的作用。這是文化界公認的事實。</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團從國內到香港。也快有兩個月了。他們在居留香港的各界同胞之中，已經留下相當深刻的印象，他們在香港文化界戲劇界和許多努力於救亡工作的社團之中，自然更應留有相當深刻的印象，現『中救』為要給香港各界賑聯會籌款救濟傷兵難民，特於廿五日起舉行大規模義演，義演後，就要前赴南洋一帶甚或踏上更遙遠的征途。我們香港的文化界戲劇界與一切愛國社團，除了要以崇敬與熱情帮助這次偉大的演出，默祝其成功和今後努力同他保持聯絡以外，個人覺得『中救』的組織生活與工作方式，中救二十餘月以來的經驗與教訓，多有值得我們認眞學習的地方。而特別重要的，至少應是以下幾點：</p>
<p>首先在組織方面『中救』是充溢着民主主義精神的一個團體，而以全體大會為最高權力機關，每週舉行一次；理串會是執行機關，亦是每舉行一次。這樣，一個團體便能個和睦的家庭甚至像一個身體，劇　了。雖然成員較多的社團，要辦到這一點較為困難，但是如果這個社團的每一成員都認真以自己所屬社團視同自己的家　與身體一般，努力　正其上級　成員間的錯誤，求具實現民主某權的精神，那麽這個社團一定能够健全發展的！</p>
<p>第二，『中救』又是最能運用分工合作原則和切實行人材主義的一個模範的團體，他們自國長金山副團長王瑩劇　部長劉丹靑，官傳部長伍禾以至林樞范政和其他團員，無一不是各俱特長各有才幹的份子，有的　稿寫文章，有的製作佈景與道具，有的　裂影片，雖然在組織與名義上有所分別，而大致都能冺除階級觀念，實現了　事有人做，人人有事做』。的原則，目前還有少數　　非不具備非常好的組織與工作　　，但事實上則上下交疑，支離破碎非使整個團體變成有名無實，便是徒供少　野心份子和歹徒騙匪所把持利甩，所以極盼一般團體都能學習『中救』泯除一切黨派和系統的私見，切實遵重人材實行分工合大家只求發展羣體，而太重視小我約利害與榮辱。</p>
<p>第三，『中救』又是能充分表現『團潔，活潑，緊張，嚴肅的精神的一個團體。他們有約法三章，卽（一）只有團體行動，沒有個人行間動，生死甘苦共之；（二）一切對對內對外事務，絕對公開；（三）謝絕一切與工作無關的公私宴會，還有四句『格言』，卽是「工作緊張，生活嚴肅，經濟淸楚，態度純正」，壯外，在事實上他們團員相互之，確能同舟共濟，互助互讓，日常生活，甚至比兄弟姊妹還要親密，所有這些，史是得為一切救亡團　認眞學習的。</p>
<p>第四，『中救』每個團員的日常生活，也是值得特別學習的。他們每晨七時至七時三十分舉行晨會，內容有時事報吿，閱讀報吿，生活檢討及工作佈置等，晨會之後是閱讀和召開小組討論會的時間。午第是辦、公和排戲，晚上是自由習作。『中救」便是在這樣實行集體學習和集體工作中成畏起來的。任何團續以至個人，如果要求不落伍不腐化不惡化，而且要求時時進步和美滿的成績，就不能不好好學習中救這種作風！</p>
<p>第五，『中救』在　際工作中，不論在前綫，在後方，或是在海外，他們一面努力取得當地政府軍隊以至各界領袖的同　贊助，一面努力聯絡當地文化界戲劇界以至一般救亡團體和社會公團，因此一切街頭工作以至深入暫壕，深入農村了廠的工作，也多能『事半功倍』，這利工作方式，往往為一般救亡團體所忽略，他們自命　進，不屑向上　活動，更不惜和不同黨派系屢的社團形成對立，甚至因小小阻障而咒駡統一戰綫，結果未有不遭挫收的。『中救』工作方式之隨得學習，亦卽在此。不過所有這些，也要視各地特殊環境特殊條件與自身力量而定，許多環境特別惡劣和條件極不俱備的地方，當然應該　自身實力作必要的奮鬥，不能階為藉口實行怠工。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要認淸，『中救』所以能够這樣做而且能夠了成功，一方而在於善於隨　實行自我批判和虛心接受一切友善的批判，接受　進的革命的黨團的經濟與教訓；另一方面有於每一團員對於抗戰建國尋業，對於中華民族解放事業的前途，鄒具有必獲最後勝利的信心；對於為抗戰建設與文化事業　服務，對於為中華民族解放而犧牲，都具有　　的决心，這兩點，又是上述一切中救『特長』的所由發楊的廳本，史議為我們文化界戲劇界和一切救亡團體認識淸是的！</p>

<h3>口才</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>中國從古以來，便有游說之士　專以口才取卿相，可見口才的效用是很大的，蓋口才除了可以做官以外，遺有下列各種效用：</p>
<p>不為人屈。有些人往往能够出入萬馬千軍，却對了人吶吶不能措一辭，吃盡寃枉之苦，有口才的人使不然，任憑有多少人和他辯難，他　可以應付裕如，佔盡勝利，諸葛亮的舌戰　儒，傳是這一例。</p>
<p>解人之危，一言九鼎，一諾千金，是說言語的力量，然而　使話很還得巧妙，一樣也可以為人解圍，謝道韞的搭救『小郎』，便是這一例。</p>
<p>到了現在，口才的用處，更為廣大，原因是國民人人都應該顧問國家大事，社會公務，處處都須演講或議論。孔門的『言語一一科，到如今已經成為各校的必修科了，所謂『演講會』，『雄辯會等，都是操經口才的組織。而今當國家多事之秋，宣傳抗戰救國的種種事項尤非口才不可</p>
<p>然而有利必有弊，固然是古今來的通例，而口才的弊多利少，似乎又是不可掩的事實：</p>
<p>說說就是口才的不良作用。蓋說謊必須有口才，否則聽者便會不信，有口才的說謊，的確可以說得天花亂墜，裏雨賓紛，使死人都活起來：至於騙殺個把人而不必賞命，今其是常事，今之所謂火牛者，也可以壽入說慌一謂，因為所吹均原是不經之談，悠謬之言，與謊同一泉源。</p>
<p>謟媚是口才的另一種不良作用。蓋雖有迫馬底之心，而無拍馬屁之口才，則馬屁必定柏在馬路上，有如前淸某當翁那樣，稱頌某中堂時，却會說：『久仰大人老奸巨猾，為朝野所畏：』善拍馬屁者，必對其人說，我知道你不吃馬屁，其人必穴喜而云，許以為知己。</p>
<p>因此，孔老夫子雖然在他的『杏壇大學』設有『言語專修科』，却最恨這種會說會話的人，　為『佞人』。他曾直直爽爽斥　過：『禦人以口給，母憎於人，焉用佞！』他大動肝火而誅少正卯時，在少正卯的罪狀中，也有『言偽而辨』這一條。</p>
<p>此外，朱太祖他的對付徐鉉，也實在是一大快事：據說，徐鉉代表南唐，來修貢例，為了他的善於詞令，一時竟揀不出一個可以應付他的人來，後來宋大祖卻親自揀了一个不議字的『侍中一官，便有了以下的結果：『始，鉉詞鋒如雲，旁觀駭愕，其人不能答徒唯唯，鉉不測，强聒而與之言，居數日，旣無酬復，鉉亦倦且厭矣！』</p>
<p>不通口才這一『科』中，還包括着　，這一個『系』，我不曉得這　是正當的，還是不正當的，因為一說起；人人心頭便有一種惡感，以為至少這是不客氣的表示，是侮辱他人，自墮人格的行為，於是村婦為那醉漢驚座，便被外入為人生之惡德。然而我們一看到話葛亮　死王助，心頭便是一陣痛快；焦大駡榮寗兩府，只是石獅子是乾凈　，也不免為之浮一大白。這如何不叫我們拍案稱讀說：駡得好呀駡得好！</p>
<p>原來駡決不是無動於中而　空生出來的：眞正的駡，也決不　上司的呵斥　員，老板的呵斥夥計，不過發脾氣擺　威　巳，總是心中實在按耐不件所以才　筐　筐一發而不可收拾。這樣的駡，往往是　妙的口明文章，口才，古時有敲牙割舌，喋血駡賊至死的忠臣，也不裸體駡賊，以解城圍的老妓，其例很多。</p>
<p>歸結起來，　使我們的口才，不能善用之於正途，不為入屈，解人之危，也不便惡用之歪途，說謊；謟媚，我看，我們還是盡用之於不正不歪途，揀當今應駡之人，痛痛快快地駡到他上天無路，入地無開！</p>
<h3>倒懸獨語</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>我開的這一所觀砂廠，究竟不曾　了你們，你們為什麽總要橫眉登眼的放不過我？老天不讓我萈死，留著選一點點活計，不曾給彈蚱掉，大火曉掉，我像狗　樣滿身汚泥，倫偷地跑囘來，把這破爛的傢伙，裝配起來，接一點生意偷一口飯吃。你們却當我發了財嗎？這當口。要發財，除非當「知事』，做『局長』，或則竟像你們這樣味了良心，　處敲詐，當着特殊的勢力，欺海同跑。像我這種人，不餓死已經　了！誰知道，不餓死却得給你們處死，你們把我打得這個樣子！叫我到那喜去吿訴？咳！</p>
<p>我買的鐵，光明正穴，有賣主，有發票，你們以為有縫可鑽了，大呼小呌的把我抓了來，麻　結了不够，還用手銬！我是强盜，强盜們才會寃人做强盜，我　裏能逃脫你們的手呢？種這威勢實作用不着呢。什麽業本部，呵，筷于亂抽，抽得我滿地的遼，我犯的什麽罪法？抽得我不時了，又把我推到間壁小屋裏，黑沉沉地；濕漉漉地、鼻子裏　是霆氣和臭氣。承　們瞧得起別讓我餓死了，每天有兩碗　吃，我纔真吃不下呢。一運關了五天，第六天上又把我牽出來，把我放了，在我背上用力一拳，還說：一朋友乖覺參，去罷。』我是强盜，為什麽又放我了？回來一問，哦，你們要去了一百塊錢！你們是綁票，你們是强盜，豺狼、你們借了特殊的勢力欺個自己的同胞！、要錢，用不利這麽兇、把人打到這　樣子，我到底不會搶了人家的東西，我到底不曾殺你們的老子！，遺傷，要幾時纔會好呢？痛呵，叫我吿訴誰去？</p>
<p>叫我吿訴誰云直視咸　？朋友嗎？全咬　片不　敢，他們全怕呢！你們說：「乖覺些，再倔强，當你游寧說，送憲兵部！」啊啊，叫我吿訴誰去了給你們提醒了。</p>
<p>在這裏，還龍活嗎？你把大模大樣的在門前過，紅眼睛向我望。我滿身　抖。不餓死也得氣死！我活不下去，我只得走，走到……</p>
<p>啊啊！痛呀……</p>
<h3>賣豆（下）</h3>
<p>— 明技</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>『鄕舊人是講得看見瓦　的，所以要當識　識了，』也有人這　代她囘答。</p>
<p>『可不是，』她一看見和她搭話，便連忙接應上去，『我們　下人眞是難得看見的，不　得遺喜有多少「人」？』</p>
<p>『不少吧；不大仔細』。究竟是不關心，不負實的答復。</p>
<p>她又在憲口看了好久，終於注意到了一個人。這人大約近四十歲的年紀，黑赤赤的臉腔，穿着短衣，是個農人的模樣。他已遺出了好幾次，每次出來時是空手的，進去時便有一些東西在手裏，可見又是個當差的。正當她　經考盧，要想下去的時候，這人却走進這邊屋與，上樓來了。她心頭一喜，就作着她的準備。</p>
<p>那人一上樓，毫不偷瓖就到窟口的一個座位坐下了，茶博士一看他坐定，不等他開口，早就將茶送了來。</p>
<p>『吃些五香豆吧？』老奶奶好像很諸便的樣子，走到他的桌邊去。</p>
<p>『不要』　她喝了一口茶說。</p>
<p>『那末黃沙荳要些麽？』它指指藍子裏。</p>
<p>『好，就來一些黃沙豆』她有了言籃子。</p>
<p>老奶奶一聽，就瀟滿握了兩把，放在他的面前，並且笑嘻嘻看看他的面　說，</p>
<p>『我好偈是認得你的，你住在那裏？』</p>
<p>『我也好像認得你，』他不免也就凑了這，句。隨後又說，『我住在李家橋』。</p>
<p>『　，李家橋。我娘家就在李家僑。』老奶奶高興的聲氣。『你呌什麽？』</p>
<p>『我李叫金根。』</p>
<p>『哈哈，對了。我看見你的時候你遺小呢』。她表示了他鄕遇故知的神情。『你一直在外面的吧』？</p>
<p>『是的，我一直在這關行裏當差的』。</p>
<p>接着她問了他許多關於藝行裏的事情，他也問了她一些來這鎭上廬豆的經過。他們越說越親熱，果然像親戚一樣。所不像的，是他立著，她遺立着，表示一個是喝茶的，一個作是買賣的。</p>
<p>『你現在覺得很好吧』？她話　一轉，就低低地問出了這句話。</p>
<p>『這也羅說，……』他的盤音也低了。</p>
<p>『金根』！在他們談得好久之後，對面底下有人在喊着，他就起身來預　走，當面答陷着一來了』，壹面就伸手到衣袋裏去　錢。</p>
<p>『明大算吧，我還有幾天躭擱呢』。老奶奶連還忙止住他。</p>
<p>『好，明天算。』金根下去了。</p>
<p>明天，他果然又吃了她的豆，又和她談了好一會。他下樓去時，她還是不要他錢，仍說，『明天算吧』</p>
<p>可是，到了這一個明天他走到這茶樓上來時，就找不到她的影呼了。他到她也許明天再會來，所以就不放在心上。</p>
<p>然而她到底沒有再到這個茶樓上來，因為她已經囘到她的家與去了。</p>
<p>我們一看見她回來，沒有一個不表數迎的。</p>
<p>『有好消息　囘來了，大家聽着吧！『王明源首先就喊了出來。</p>
<p>『沒有什麽奸消息；』老奶奶將肩上的布袋放到桌子上時說，『這裏遺剩有一些豆，倒可以給你們吃吃』</p>
<p>『什麽？那裏來這幾種豆？』倒在桌子上的豆，大家都看見了。</p>
<p>『賣剩的。』</p>
<p>『你去賣豆的？那末消息呢？』</p>
<p>『喲，忘了，』她故意失驚地說，『我只知道賣豆，却忘了大事。』</p>
<p>「說吧說吧，」大宗知道她開玩笑。</p>
<p>『眞的忘了；你們將這些豆分別揀在一起，數一數，也許我就會記起來。』大家都不懂她的意忠。但相信她樓有道理，所以就依她的話，一一弄好</p>
<p>一黃沙豆有幾粒？她問。『最少，只有三粒。』</p>
<p>『那末告訴你們：小鋼砲最少，只有三尊。』</p>
<p>『哦！』大家這才明白過來，不約而問同地透了這一口氣。</p>
<p>『鹽浸　呢？』</p>
<p>『六粒』</p>
<p>『遺是重機關搶。』</p>
<p>此後是五　豆十四粒，輕機關槍：發芽豆一百十八粒，步槍。</p>
<p>『還有酥豆二八十二粒，是什麽呢？一末了，王明源等不及的問。</p>
<p>『這還要說空，』老奶奶笑笑，『槍砲之外，一還有什麽我們要曉得呢？』</p>
<p>『該死，』王明源也笑起來，『我竟這樣的糊塗。」</p>
<p>老奶奶又在桌子上將各種豆另外分記了一下，指着一堆一堆的豆對大家說：中</p>
<p>『這是駐在裏橋口五龍圍澡堂子裏的；這是駐在』市公大繭行的；這是……</p>
<p>她口講指劃，非常淸楚，使大　的頭腦中留下了深刻的印象，就好走到靑鎭去親自來的一樣。</p>
<p>『現在你們眞的將這些豆吃了吧。』她講完之後說</p>
<p>『好，我吃機關槍！』</p>
<p>『我吃；』</p>
<p>在一　歡笑的空氣中，桌上的豆吃得一　都沒有，不過這些荳所代表的事情，却已　另外有人紀錄下來，荳也的確沒有用了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，上海的報紙上有靑　一度被克　的議細紀載。也有關于源明的名宇，却沒有　到老奶奶，誰會相信賣荳的老奶奶會和這事有關係呢，就是李金樓到現在還在詫異她不來向他　荳錢呢。　（完）</p>
<h3>撇棄與探尋</h3>
<p>— 錢昌手</p>
<p>我驅散了一切的囘憶，可是他們像一羣可惡的蒼蠅一樣，一下孑又飛囘來，老是在耳際嗡嗡的問了。</p>
<p>輕輕地推開那扇心之門，在裏面，藏着我舊日的記憶。</p>
<p>沈默的心像一隻白帆船駛在囘憶的順流上。他將我帶到遼遠的地方去：</p>
<p>那當時確曾使我流下淚的往事已不能再逗起我一次的悲哀：那舊日引得我歡欣的故事也不能使我再發笑。</p>
<p>撇棄了過去的一切，我的心又開始覺到空虛。</p>
<p>舊日的一切都是該撇棄的，我將帶了自己的心赴那足跡未到過的遠万探尋那可以充空那虛空的心底東一四。</p>
<h3>尋求</h3>
<p>— 黎晨</p>
<p>培脚邊生出芳芬的專花。樣莽問長起關麗的花叢，常使一個困乏的旅人見了，浮了一　　慰的微笑，是的，　使這動亂的世界是一片沙漢，它是一點水源，而在這飛體着風，霆的宇宙中，我們遺因它而望見　色的藍天，</p>
<p>在寂寞中，花似乎是不安的人生的遊　　了，誰不將它當作創傷的靈魂的安慰呢？</p>
<p>然而，這世界似乎狹窄得可　，竟不能容納任何一朶芬芳的花兒。</p>
<p>於是，當茫茫的旅論屡　在面前的時候；每一個　失去了詑的帆給一樣，　　翌　，然而風又將往那兒次呢？却誰也不能知道。</p>
<p>找尋一朶花，一點創傷的慰籍，曾經犧牲了無數的生命，為了解放出壓在石隙里的芳草：為了指引一隻迷送的羔羊：為了美還這世界，為了溫暖這宇宙，誰會吝惜他的一掬汗，一滴血，乃至個人的生命呢？</p>
<p>穿過林莽，馳過沙漢，無數的人　勇毅地踏上征這，背負了風霜，肩挑着苦難，僕僕風雲地走了一半或者大半的路途：不幸得很，有的在山徑中遇到獅虎，經過一場猛烈的搏鬥，同歸於盡。有的為了偶然的錯誤，吞下了劇毒的外衣的花朵。</p>
<p>我感動了，對於這些『賣志而歿』的人衆。用生命隊去了阻礙，他遺留下一條未來的康莊，他們給人以『鬥爭』的昭示；他們給人以『毒化』的警惕。先人的還齊，遺有比這『血的經驗一更為寳實的　？</p>
<p>假使你眷　於窗前的一點盆栽，假使你　往於溫室里的幾朶草花，那麽你　該向遠眺望一下：那充滿了絢料的花　的自由之天國，正向着你招手，奮勇地去尋求吧了先人的血肉已簪你鋪下了大道！</p>

        <h1>1939.05.25</h1>
<h3>Danzig and the Lugou Bridge</h3>
<p>The Danzig problem has become extremely serious these past few days. In particular, after the German shock troops attacked the Polish customs post at Bickel on the 21st, the entire Danzig area has been plunged into a "calm before the storm" situation.</p>
<p>The Danzig problem is not new. Fascist Germany's conspiracy to seize Danzig and attack Poland is not only a pre-planned scheme, but tens of thousands of thugs have already secretly infiltrated and are active. This activity has also been condoned by democratic countries, especially × country. The situation is just like the Lugou Bridge incident on the eve of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Therefore, at this time when Germany is stepping up its conspiracy to attack, and when the German-Italian military alliance was signed the day before yesterday, and when Britain, France, and other countries believe that concessions have reached the final juncture and announced their agreement to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union, people will say that Danzig will be Europe's Lugou Bridge!</p>
<p>Will Danzig ultimately become Europe's Lugou Bridge? Although it remains to be seen whether Germany and Italy, especially Hitler, can pull back from the brink, and although it remains to be seen whether Britain and France, especially Chamberlain, can take genuine measures to safeguard collective security and closely unite with the Soviet Union, we can clearly point out at least the following three points today:</p>
<p>First, since the establishment of the German-Italian "Anti-Communist" pact, it has long been a military alliance attempting to attack democratic and peaceful countries, re-divide colonies, and even re-make the world map. However, some capitalist countries, especially × country's financial capitalists and government, still fantasize that the likes of Hitler and Mussolini can genuinely cooperate to oppose communism and then unite with Britain and France to form a four-power group, organize an anti-communist crusade, and transfer the European crisis to the red Russian continent. However, now there are not only the bloody and tearful facts of Austria, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, but Hitler and Mussolini have also automatically torn off the "anti-communist" mask, exposing their ambition to attack democratic and peaceful countries and redistribute the world, and announced the formal signing of the German-Italian military alliance! Thus, Mr. Chamberlain's fantasies have been fundamentally shattered.</p>
<p>Second, forbearance and concession have reached the final juncture. The vast majority of the British people, the Communist Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and even many far-sighted people in the Conservative Party, have awakened and will rise up. This will be the greatest force that will make Mr. Chamberlain have to change his policy. The British government will have no choice but to strengthen its solidarity and cooperation with France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to resist fascist aggressors.</p>
<p>Third, the international situation is developing in the direction of resisting and counterattacking fascist aggressors. At the same time, the result of the fascist aggression policy is also leading the economic situation and the entire people of Germany and Italy towards poverty, darkness, and death. Under these internal and external pressures, Germany and Italy can only step up their speculative and adventurous steps, shifting the internal crisis from newer and larger wars and overwhelming the anti-aggression front that has not yet been consolidated and expanded.</p>
<p>Whether the city of Danzig will become Europe's Lugou Bridge is no longer the main issue today! The question now is: Can the anti-aggression front be increasingly consolidated and developed? That is, we must ask whether the tripartite political and military mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be publicly established and earnestly implemented? Moreover, in view of the interconnectedness of the world in the current major war crisis and the truth that "peace is indivisible," we must further ask: Can the anti-aggression front include the Far East and be increasingly consolidated and developed? That is, can the friendly relations between Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China be further consolidated and developed to form a mutual assistance organization? If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then, although Danzig or other regions are in immediate danger of becoming Europe's Lugou Bridge, and although the Second World War, which hundreds of millions of people have been worried about for years, is about to fully erupt (many people are unwilling to admit the fact that the World War has already begun since the Mukden Incident and the Spanish War), however, looking at the big picture and the long term, we can predict: Due to the absolute superiority and majestic strength of the anti-aggression front, due to the internal crisis and weakness of the aggressors, and due to the greater progress of China's anti-aggression struggle, even if it is a world war, the duration of the war is expected to be shortened, the cruelty of the war is also expected to be reduced, and human culture will suffer less damage. Conversely, if the answers to these questions are negative, then, even if the current war continues to remain temporarily in the "local stage," the result of continuing to reward the aggressors will make the future of the world truly unbearable and unimaginable!</p>
<h3>The Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Area in Southeastern Shanxi (II)</h3>
<p>— Ke Han</p>
<p>In order to understand the work of the lower-level administrative organs, the Special Commissioner's Office organized an inspection group, divided into several groups of three to five people each, to go to various places for inspection, in order to communicate opinions and spirit between the upper and lower levels and improve the lower-level administrative organs.</p>
<p>As for personnel, there have been very good adjustments from the system to the district. Taking the Fifth District as an example, among the thirteen county magistrates, except for Changzi, the other twelve counties have all been replaced with important personnel. Those corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats who only knew how to be officials and did not care about the people, and who panicked at the sound of gunfire, have been gradually eliminated and replaced by a group of young people with red blood and loyalty, full of enthusiasm, most of whom are talented people from the Sacrifice League. In order to adjust personnel, the government also opened training classes for administrative personnel, specializing in training a group of government section chiefs, district chiefs, and village chiefs. Such training classes in the Fifth Administrative District continued for five sessions, and individual counties also held their own training classes to train lower-level administrative personnel.</p>
<p>These young people, who had never handled official business before, were no worse at "official business" than their predecessors. With their youthful enthusiasm, they promoted the entire political power and made local administrative work lively, tense, and full of vitality. When you pass by the village office in a village or the district office in a town, you can often see the village chief's or district chief's house crowded with a large group of people, arguing enthusiastically in their local dialects about some problem. People who are not familiar with the situation in southeastern Shanxi would think they are arguing, but in fact, they are holding a joint meeting of village deputies or village chiefs to discuss the local administrative work of a village or a district. If something cannot be resolved, hold a meeting to discuss it together - this is the unique style of young local officials.</p>
<p>They are not only very organized and disciplined in their work, but also very disciplined in their lives. Taking the county government as an example, all staff members get up at 5 or 6 o'clock to do morning exercises and hold morning meetings, and the county magistrate leads them in climbing mountains and running. Several times, when reporters were rushing on the road, they climbed over the saddle early in the morning and drove out of the city. At the foot of the city, they could often hear the commands of "one, two, one." The staff of the county government and the People's Armed Self-Defense Forces were drilling together on a lawn. They have also established a learning life. Every staff member must read newspapers and books, which has almost become a habit. In some counties, they even hold study group discussions every night. Thus, the government is both an administrative organ and a learning organ.</p>
<p>With such a group of young people who are enthusiastic about their work and live such a rigorous life, their frugality and integrity are not a problem. Their unified salary has been reduced considerably. In the Third District, the uniform treatment is 20 yuan. Of course, during the Anti-Japanese War, such a salary was not considered the lowest. However, compared to the past, when a section chief received hundreds of yuan a month and still sought various extra income, there is an unimaginable difference. In fact, they usually take out a portion of their 20 yuan salary for various donations, such as comforting soldiers and contributing money. Government workers always stand at the forefront and enthusiastically advocate these activities.</p>
<p>The integrity of government workers and the frugality of government funds not only reduced the burden on the people but also increased the people's faith in the government. Only when government personnel live frugally can the people's prejudices against the government be eliminated.</p>
<p>The fifth characteristic is the combativeness of the government. In areas close to the × area, this combativeness can be fully demonstrated. For example, in Pingding and Xiyang on the Zhengtai Railway, and Yuci, Taigu, and Hongdong on the Tongpu Line, they often live under the noses of the × people. In some places, the × people live at the foot of the mountain, and they live on the mountain. In some places, the × people live on the mountain, and they live in the valley, less than ten li apart. Yet they can carry out their government work in the base area as if nothing had happened. They have the protection of the masses. The masses act as their scouts, and the masses stand in the front to give them sentry duty. Also, counties such as Pingding, Xiyang, Heshun, Yuanxian, Qinshui, Fushan, and Yucheng are often subjected to counterattacks by the × people. They can very flexibly meet the × people's attacks. When the × people occupy the city, they can lead the local armed masses to surround the × people and fight guerrilla warfare until the × people cannot stand it and withdraw. Then they can quickly stabilize social order. It should be especially pointed out that when these counties initially restored political power, only a dozen villages were under their jurisdiction. Now our political power has expanded to the entire county. The Eastern Route Office of the Sixth Administrative District even organized a × Area Work Group to go deep into the cities and villages occupied by the × people to carry out the work of winning over the masses and shaking the puppet organizations. They carried a large number of official propaganda materials to the × area for distribution. Compared with the political power of the puppet government organized by the Japanese special service agencies, the anti-Japanese government led by our National Government is vastly different. No wonder the puppet provincial governors and puppet county magistrates had to cry out, "There is no province to govern" and "There is no county to govern."</p>
<p>In the various county local governments in the hinterland of southeastern Shanxi, after the Nine-Route Encirclement, there was a period when the × people did not dare to try to insert themselves into the hinterland of southeastern Shanxi again. It appeared to be a "nation-building" government, but in the work of preparing to welcome the new offensive of the × people this time, it still showed its combativeness. When the × people occupied Lingdao County and Heshun, the administrative workers in these counties issued a very meaningful slogan: "It's good for the × people to come once. One time can be a test of our work." They simply regard the × people's attack as an exam paper. Good students are not afraid of exams sooner or later. Today, each county is actively arranging its wartime work. They have already planned how to divide the county government into two or three parts to continue to promote administrative work when the × people insert both feet into the hinterland and the county and district areas are divided into two or three parts.</p>
<p>The above is a description of the characteristics of the political power in southeastern Shanxi, which can also be said to be its advantages. It should be stated that these advantages are due to the leadership of Commander Yan, who promulgated the decrees to abolish exorbitant taxes and reduce rent and interest. It was he who boldly promoted and used young people to government agencies regardless of whether they had experience in administrative work, and allowed them to work freely. But at the same time, it should also be stated that the people who directly implement Commander Yan's will are also extremely important. The political power work in other regions may not be as successful as in southeastern Shanxi. In the middle of this, the Sacrifice National Salvation League and the Public Justice Corps also play an undeniable role. In the entire Shanxi Province, southeastern Shanxi is probably the region with the greatest influence of the Sacrifice Public League. They almost have the same power as the county government, especially the Sacrifice League. There is almost nothing that it does not ask about. Also, because many county magistrates are from the Sacrifice League, they are led by the Sacrifice League organization and listen to the opinions of the Sacrifice League organization. Local administrative chiefs often put forward the slogan of the Sacrifice League line and require their subordinates to strictly implement the Sacrifice League line.</p>
<p>But southeastern Shanxi cannot be said to be a 100% perfect area. It still has some defects:</p>
<p>First, in terms of democratic politics, it should be pointed out that the election of village chiefs is not necessarily carried out normally in some areas. In some places, regardless of whether the village chief is good or bad, they listen to the masses to re-elect, so that the newly elected village chief is not as good as the old village chief. In some places, there is often factionalism when electing village chiefs, with the new village chief opposing the old village chief, and Village A opposing Village B, resulting in mutual competition, mutual exclusion, and the brewing of bad disputes. It can also be seen that while giving the masses democratic rights, it is also necessary to train the masses to exercise their democratic rights. Now, the government agencies have already noticed this point, and their approach is to grant the masses democratic rights as much as possible in principle, but at the same time, the elected village chief must be approved by the government, or the masses elect two or three people, and the government determines the final choice.</p>
<p>Secondly, the administrative meetings have not played their due role. In individual counties, administrative meetings are still just a formality and cannot fully reflect public opinion and truly promote the spirit of people's participation in government. In the expanded administrative meetings held in the Third and Fifth Administrative Districts recently, this issue was especially emphasized and the organization of the administrative meetings was enriched. There should be a change in the future.</p>
<p>Second, the reform of the government structure is not thorough. It is possible that the county magistrate is good, and the police chief is good, but the section chief is not necessarily good. In particular, the messengers, guardhouse, and political and legal departments often retain their old habits. The lower the level, the more inadequate the reform is. This situation is more common in the Fifth District, especially in the more remote villages. It is precisely because the lower-level organizations are not yet very sound that the government and the masses cannot be integrated, and the masses still have doubts about the government in certain places. We sincerely hope that the wise local officials in southeastern Shanxi can go further and make further in-depth reforms to the administrative organs.</p>

After three hours of fierce fighting, the × people were defeated and fled back to Chezhen. The casualties were quite numerous. Also, the chief who committed suicide in Deping was Matsuno. This was due to the prolongation of the war, the depletion of national strength, and resentment against the upper-level warlords who still refused to reflect.</p>
<p>[Telegram from the Central News Agency in Jinhua on the 23rd] On the evening of the 13th, our unit in western Zhejiang launched a fierce attack on Chongde County. The × people were caught off guard and we rushed into the city, annihilating all the × troops entrenched in the city.

<h3>The Situation on Gulangyu Is Worsening, Four-Nation Talks Have Reached a Stalemate, the British Firmly Refuse to Discuss the Issue of Administrative Power in the Concession, the × Attitude Is Overbearing, Sending Warships to Cut Off Traffic to the Island</h3>
<p>[Report from Hong Kong] According to informal sources, the talks between the naval representatives of Britain, the United States, and France and the Japanese side on Gulangyu have reached a stalemate because the Japanese side insists on demanding amendments to the concession charter to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Gulangyu Municipal Council by three. According to reliable sources, British Naval Commander Noble has firmly refused to discuss this issue, stating that he is unwilling to discuss anything other than the issue of Japanese naval landing. The talks were held yesterday morning on the British warship Birmingham. British Naval Commander Admiral Noble, the new Coastal Navy Commander Vice Admiral Parker, Commander of the US South China Fleet Stapler, and Japanese Naval Commander Vice Admiral Kondo all attended. The talks began at 10:00 AM and ended at noon. After the meeting, Japanese Commander Kondo immediately returned to his warship and summoned the head of the Xiamen Special Service Agency and Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Uchida, for urgent discussions. Afterwards, Uchida submitted a new protest to the consular corps, stating, "The landing of British, American, and French navies on Gulangyu is not only an unfriendly attitude towards Japan, but also sufficient to encourage anti-Japanese elements in the concession. The Japanese authorities regard the tense situation caused by the landing of the navies of Britain, the United States, and France as extremely serious." Uchida also put forward five counter-demands: (1) The Gulangyu Municipal Council should effectively manage the concession to prevent it from turning into an anti-Japanese base. (2) The Municipal Council and the police station should be reorganized. (3) Taiwanese people should be granted the right to vote in the Municipal Council. (4) The three vacant seats of the Chinese directors should be replaced by personnel from the Xiamen puppet maintenance association. (5) The Municipal Council and the Japanese consular police should cooperate closely. At the same time, according to the Japanese side, because the negotiations have now failed, the Japanese navy is implementing a blockade of Gulangyu, with only Xiamen as the only road. A Japanese cruiser has dropped anchor between Gulangyu and the Fujian coast to cut off traffic to that side. Other areas are also fully guarded by Japanese patrol ships, and only ships approved by the Japanese are allowed to sail. At the same time, a flagship and a destroyer also departed from Tokyo for Gulangyu yesterday, so the number of foreign warships concentrated there has reached as many as ten, and the atmosphere is quite tense.</p>
<p>Tokyo Is Making Empty Threats to the Three Countries Again</p>
<p>[Reuters Report from Tokyo on the 24th] Today, the Japanese newspapers here prominently published news about the meeting of the naval representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan on Gulangyu on the British warship "Birmingham." According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Japanese naval authorities have decided to cut off traffic between Gulangyu and Fujian Province to isolate Gulangyu from the outside world, but it can still communicate with Xiamen. The newspaper also said that if Japan's "reasonable demands" are rejected and the powers take joint action to intimidate, Japan will strictly implement its policies without any concessions.</p>
<p>[Telegram from the Central News Agency in Washington on the 23rd]　The State Department said that US officials are currently considering how to deal with the current situation on Gulangyu.</p>
<h3>× Is Threatening the Concessions Everywhere Again, Saying They Will Send Troops into the Concessions and Will Not Allow Foreign Forces to Interfere</h3>
<p>[Reuters Report from Tokyo on the 24th] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said today, "Japan has decided to use force to drive out anti-Japanese elements in the concessions throughout China. Because these elements are instructed by the Kuomintang, they should be regarded as Chinese activities. We will not allow interference from foreign forces in these measures. Japan must participate in the management rights of the Public Concessions. If the situation requires it, Japan has the right to send troops into the concessions."</p>
<h3>Johnson Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Flies from Japan to Shanghai: Organizes a Ceasefire Association and Plays New Tricks, Attempts to Deceive the Public by Buying Off Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Shanghai News: Authentic information confirms that Wang Jingwei flew back to Shanghai from Fukuoka on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shanghai Special Dispatch, 24th] Wang's faction appointed people in Shanghai to buy off newspapers in order to carry out their efforts. The "International Evening News," which has been suspended for five days, is rumored to resume publication soon, with Wang Tianhen as editor and Xu Tianfang, the proofreading director of a certain newspaper, as line editor. Xu is the organizer of "Minli Weekly." However, the publisher of the "Evening News," Kranpe, has received a notice from the consulate asking him to postpone the resumption of publication pending a thorough investigation. Wang Tianhen also resigned due to rumors of the newspaper's connection to Wang. The newspaper's resumption of publication is still pending.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Tianjin News: The × side is still attempting to end the war as soon as possible. After the failure of the so-called Peace and National Salvation Association organized several months ago, they have a new plan: Initiated by Wang Jingwei, they plan to organize a World Peace and Ceasefire Games, with the aim of appealing for peace and promoting Sino-Japanese amity, thereby enticing the public to quickly end the war. It is said that the general headquarters will be established in Shanghai, with Wang as chairman, and branch offices will be established in Peiping and Tianjin. Jiang Chaozong is tentatively appointed as president of the Peiping branch, and Le Yunpeng is tentatively appointed as president of the Tianjin branch. The name "World" is used because the × side is prepared to establish a similar organization when necessary, to echo each other. It is also said that a German named Hong, who used to be a professor at Peking University, has also agreed to join. In addition, they will encourage people from various countries living in Peiping to participate.

<h3>On the Ganbei Front Line</h3>
<p>— Fan Shizhi</p>
<p>(I) The Story of Climbing the City</p>
<p>On April 25th, Ga'an City had been surrounded by a certain regiment of a certain division of our army. Due to the lack of heavy weapons, there was no better way than climbing the city for the solid city walls. On that day, platoon leader Yu Guangyi led a platoon of soldiers to prepare to climb the city, while the regimental commander stood by and watched.</p>
<p>They arrived at the edge of the north gate, where the outside of the city was a high ground, which seemed easier to climb. The brothers gently leaned the scaling ladder against the city wall. The × army guarding the city did not care at all. At this time, platoon leader Yu took the lead in climbing, when suddenly, an enlisted man, Li Wenrong, who had been in the army for less than four months, came up and reported to the platoon leader: "Platoon leader, you can't climb, I should climb first!" The platoon leader said to him, "You have been in the army for less than four months and don't know the danger, I should climb first." After the platoon leader said this, he climbed up the ladder. When he reached the top, a × army soldier suddenly stabbed at him with a bayonet, injuring Yu's left arm. Yu immediately threw a hand grenade at the × army, killing two × soldiers. Another × soldier opened fire, and Yu was shot and killed, rolling down the city wall. The next one to go up was a squad leader and four soldiers, who were all shot and killed. At this time, our attack was slightly frustrated, and the soldiers all watched and did not move forward. Private Li Wenrong then jumped forward, took the wooden-shell gun that platoon leader Yu had left on the ladder, and went straight up the ladder. The soldiers were inspired by him and were unwilling to fall behind, and seven or eight people followed up the ladder. When Li Wenrong reached the top, he first threw a hand grenade into the × machine gun bunker, killing four × soldiers. Then, he continued to fire the wooden-shell gun at the city, also injuring three × soldiers. The × army on the city urgently opened fire and shot at Li indiscriminately. As a result, Li was shot in the eye, left chest, and buttocks, and also rolled down the city wall. He was carried to a field hospital for treatment by stretcher-bearers.</p>
<p>Because they all knew what the most glorious death was. For the eternal life of the Chinese nation, inspired, motivated, and touched by their great spirit. At 2:20 AM on the 26th, our army finally captured Ga'an City.</p>
<p>(II) Annotation of the War of Attrition</p>
<p>About 30 li northeast of Ga'an, the Pig Mother Great Hill relied on solid bunkers to defend. We failed to attack twice. Company commander Li Quanlong was very annoyed. That night, he sent a platoon of brothers to attack at night. Just as they touched the vicinity of the bunker and were about to start their action, they heard a series of explosions from the kerosene tanks, and the × machine guns fired like a string of pearls. We lost five more brothers, but they were all wondering where the sound of the kerosene tanks came from. That night, they went back and held a small group meeting. After discussing the results, they learned that the × people had tied the kerosene tanks to a large tree about five or six zhang outside the bunker, with a wooden block tied inside the tank and connected to the inside of the bunker with a wire. When the guard heard any movement outside, he would repeatedly pull the wire back and forth, and the tank would make a booming sound, so the sleeping × bandits inside the bunker would know to be on guard. We came to this conclusion, and the next night, we sent a brother to slowly摸to the side of the kerosene tank, gently tied a rope to the wire, and held the other end of the rope in his hand, tiptoeing to the hillside below the side of the bunker, which was a blind spot. The × machine guns couldn't hit it no matter what. So he pulled the rope, and the oil tank响了. The × bandits in the bunker woke up from their dreams one after another. In the darkness, they grabbed the machine gun handle and fired back and forth vigorously for 20 minutes, seeing that there was no movement outside. They went back to sleep again. But as soon as they fell asleep, the oil tank响了 again. So they got up and fired again. After doing this twice, the × bandits inside the bunker couldn't sleep peacefully all night.</p>
<p>The next day, the × bandits patrolled around the bunker, but found nothing. At night, they came four times in the same way. The × bandits knew that it was our attacking troops playing tricks on them, but because it was dark, they didn't know the strength of our army, so they didn't dare to come out to search. So they just let the bullets suffer. After firing霹霹拍打for another night, these × bandits didn't get any sleep for two nights.</p>
<p>The next day, the kerosene tank rang again. The × bandits thought it was still the same trick. Exhausted, they ignored it and buried their heads to sleep. The kerosene tank rang twice, but there was no movement in the bunker. By the third time, there was still no movement. At this time, our night raiding army saw that they had ambushed all around, so they rushed forward, climbed up the bunker from the scaling ladder, and threw hand grenades into the machine gun holes in all directions. All the 20 or so × bandits in the bunker were wiped out by us. The Pig Sand Great Hill was thus quickly and completely occupied by us.</p>
<p>(III) Brilliant Future</p>
<p>Battalion commander Wu Xizhao took two brothers to the front line to inspect the position. From a distance, he saw three or forty ×bandits approaching to search for us. For a moment, there was nowhere to hide. Battalion commander was anxious and suddenly had an idea. Seeing a solitary big tree on the earthen hill in front, he climbed to the treetop and said to his two brothers, "You can shoot in the direction I designate to warn the ×bandits." The two brothers obeyed the order and left. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Kunming Education During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Mu Ti</p>
<p>[Kunming Special Dispatch] Since the war of resistance entered the first stage, Kunming has become an important rear base and an important station on the southwestern international transportation route. It might be welcomed by overseas readers to introduce the situation of the education sector here!</p>
<p>After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, China's culture gradually moved inward. The following universities successively moved to Kunming: The Southwest Associated University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhongzheng Medical College, Central Political School Branch, Tongji University, Tangshan Institute of Technology, National Art College, Huazhong University, etc. For a time, the ancient city in the south became a hub of culture. The situations of the universities are briefly described below:</p>
<p>National Yunnan University. Its predecessor was Donglu University, founded by General Tang Jiyao, which was later renamed Yunnan Provincial University, with colleges of arts, law, science, engineering, and a medical training program (including four years of internship). The students were mainly from the province, with a few from Hunan and Guizhou. In June of last year, the Ministry of Education ordered the preparation for nationalization, with Xiong Qinglai as the director of preparation. It was formally established in January of this year, still headed by Xiong, with Xiao Shuyu as the director of academic affairs, Xu Shengzu as the secretary, Wu Jianyi as the director of the training committee, Xiao Shuyu as the dean of the College of Arts and Law, the president of the College of Science concurrently, Yang Jiyan as the dean of the College of Engineering, and Fan Bingzhe as the dean of the College of Medicine, which was changed from the medical training program. The school accepts both male and female students. Because the coastal provinces have 相继沦为 guerrilla war zones, many transfer students and visiting students from outside have joined. At the same time, after the reorganization of the National University, the level has been greatly improved, so a preparatory course (equivalent to a university preparatory course) and a tutorial class have been added to allow graduates of various middle schools in the province to衔接in their academic programs. Recently, the school was ordered by the Ministry of Education to set up a mining training program,收高中毕业 students, with a two-year study period, to prepare for the exploitation of underground富源, but to bear the supply of the long-term war of resistance. In mid-February, the school invited Mr. Tang Huisun to prepare for the establishment of an agricultural college. There are five or six senior and junior agricultural schools in the province. When this plan is realized in the future, agricultural学生 will have more opportunities to go to school.</p>
<p>National Southwest Associated University. The schools were jointly formed by Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University. Each of them has a glorious history in the past. After the merger, they first moved to Changsha, Hunan, and then moved to Kunming in March of last year. Jiang Menglin, Mei Yi-qi, and Zhang Boling (Mr. Zhang is the deputy speaker of the National Senate and is stationed in Chongqing all year round, so Huang Yusheng is acting on his behalf.) serve as members of the school committee. Below are ten departments, including the secretary department, with Yang Zhensheng as the secretary-general, Shen Lv as the director of academic affairs, Jiang Jichang as the director of general affairs, Huang Yusheng as the director of construction, Feng Youlan as the dean of the College of Arts, Chen Xujing as the dean of the College of Law and Commerce, Wu Youxun as the dean of the College of Science, Shi Jiayang as the dean of the College of Engineering, Huang Yusheng as the dean of the Teachers College, and Yuan Tongli as the director of the library. There are more than 2,000 students, and the entire new building of Kunhua Agricultural School is used as the main campus. The classrooms and dormitories are 不敷分配, and Kunhua Middle School, Kunhua Normal School, and Kunhua Xiaoxue are also used. Fortunately, the schools in this province are generally疏散to various prefectures and counties by order of the Department of Education to avoid air raids, so it is not a problem. Recently, the agricultural school is going to收回self-use, which has cost the school's responsible personnel quite a bit of hesitation. Therefore, they have started to build new school buildings. On the New Year's Eve, the school's drama troupe presented "Motherland" as a幕剧, to raise shoes and socks for the front-line soldiers, with very good results, with a净余 of more than 1,000 yuan. The director of "Motherland" is Professor Chen Ling, and the protagonist is Ms. Fengzi, both of whom are famous figures in the theater world.</p>
<p>National Sun Yat-sen University. The school was founded in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. Mr. Zou Haibin was the president. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was expanded into seven colleges of arts, law, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and normal school. In October of last year, Guangzhou was lost. Through Guilin 遷滇复课, the director of affairs, Zou Zhuoran, came to Yunnan to negotiate. A temporary campus has been selected in Ganjiang. More than 100 professors have arrived in Yunnan. There are 2,300 undergraduate students in the previous academic year. Adding this year's freshmen, there are a total of 2,800 students. They are currently 陆续来滇. The last batch arrived in Kunming on the 12th. They rented Qinggong School in the urban area as a temporary campus in order to接洽遄赴征江报到上课.</p>
<p>National Zhongzheng Medical College. The college is a national medical school. In November of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Jiangxi Provincial Government劃architectural基500餘亩, with a construction cost of more than 600,000, which took one year to complete. To commemorate Committee Chairman Chiang's special achievements in governing Jiangxi, it was named "Zhongzheng." Classes started in September of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, with a total of 220 students. Currently, 85 male and 31 female students have arrived in Yunnan and are temporarily taking classes in the教室 of the Christian YMCA. They have recently建适合战时需要的经济校舍on the outskirts of Kunming. (Most of the building materials are made of clay.) The school's founding purpose is different from that of general medical students. The study period is five years, and after graduation, they will be cadres for promoting the public health system. Because most of the current medical studies are completed in six or seven years, and after graduation, they may not all serve the society, and even set up private clinics, charging high fees, which makes the poor见而却步. The public health system is that medical students should all serve the country and society, relieve the diseases and pains of the general public, so that there will no longer be class discrimination in health care. The president is Wang Zihan, who has served as the president of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha for many years.</p>
<p>Central Political School Branch. The school is located in Dali. Last year, Professor Tang Huisun was sent to Yunnan to prepare for it. Later, because Tang was transferred to the Qunxi Reclamation Company to preside over the business, Professor Wang Maozu was responsible for the preparation. The school site has been selected in Dali, in order to give students in remote areas the opportunity to study. The school has started classes for the initial students this semester, and the senior students are preparing for enrollment.</p>
<p>National Tongji University. The school was initially founded by Germans, named Tongji School, with medical and engineering departments. It was officially renamed National Tongji University in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and the government allocated annual funding. Later, the Labor University奉令merged with the school as an affiliated industrial vocational school, and an affiliated middle school was also added. After the August 13th Incident, the Ministry ordered the school to move to Jinhua, Zhejiang, and then to Kunming. There are currently more than 900 students. The president is Weng Zhilong, the secretary-general is Zhang Zhaozhi, Chen Shaoxian, the director of academic affairs is Tang Mei, the dean of the College of Medicine is Ning Yu, the dean of the College of Science is Wang Baoren, Wu Zhihan is the dean of the College of Engineering, Tang Mei is the dean of the affiliated vocational school, Feng Chengzhi is the director of the affiliated middle school, and there are about 250 faculty and staff members. The Colleges of Science and Engineering are at Fuchun Middle School 上,課the medical school is located in Jinbi Park, and the training hospital is the Provincial Kunhua Hospital.</p>
<p>National Tangshan Institute of Technology. The institute is one of the research institutes of National Jiaotong University, founded in the late Qing Dynasty, and has a history of 34 years. In the past, the institute focused on teaching civil engineering and metallurgy. Later, due to the war of resistance, the civil engineering department was moved to Hunan, and merged with the Railway Management College of Jiaotong University to form the Railway Management Office. The remaining parts moved to Hunan in March of last year. Because Hunan Province was still close to the front line, the Ministry ordered the school to move to Yunnan on November 14 of the same year. The person in charge of preparation, Luo Zhongchen, Li Pei, and Ye Jiayuan, set up an office at Kunming Sandongshu, and selected a school site in Yuxi. The school has had 28 classes of graduates over the years, with a total of more than 2,000 people. Most of them are now serving on the Dianmian and叙昆roads, making great contributions. There are four classes of students in the student body, totaling more than 400 people, both male and female. The president is Mao Yisheng.</p>
<p>National College of Art. The school was formed by the merger of the National Art College of Hangzhou and the National Art College of Peiping. Last year, it moved to Huanling, Hunan, and was once改组. The original presidents of the two schools, Lin Fengmian and Zhao Qi, resigned one after another. The Ministry appointed Teng Gu as the president, and expanded and adjusted the original departments, which were divided into three departments: specialized art, applied art, and senior art vocational school. The calligrapher Chang Shuhong and the sculptor Wang Ziyun served as directors respectively. Pure art is divided into painting, sculpture, architecture, and printmaking. Applied art is divided into工艺美术, and dyeing and weaving patterns. The senior art vocational school uses the equipment of various departments to set up practical technical training classes. There are about 300 students and more than 30 faculty and staff members. They have all陆续到滇 and have selected Lufeng as the school site. The Kunming office is located at No. 112 Jinniu Street.</p>
<p>Huazhong University. The school was established in the twentieth year of the Republic of China and was formed by the merger of four universities: Wenhua, Yali, Hubin, and Bowen. It was originally located in Wuchang. Later, due to the war of resistance, it moved south to Guilin. Recently, due to the tense air raids in Guilin, it took advantage of the end of the semester to move to Yunnan to resume classes. There are currently 300 students, who have陆续由龙州转滇越铁路来省. The school site is Dali or Xizhou, which has not yet been completely decided. It is divided into two colleges of arts and sciences, with Cao Zhuomin as the president, Capen as the dean of the College of Science, and Hu Yi, the president of the College of Arts, concurrently as the dean of the College of Education. The temporary office is currently located in the Zion Church on Jinbi Road.</p>
<p>The situation of higher education has been described above. As for military schools, which are related to national defense, they should be kept secret, so I will omit them.</p>

<h3>The Anglo-Franco-Soviet Agreement Will Be Concluded Soon: The Geneva Negotiations Have Been Successfully Concluded: The British Foreign Secretary Returns Home to Attend a Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] It is reported from Geneva that Halifax and Maisky have reached an agreement in principle on the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. Only the final approval of the British and Soviet governments is required. The French side expressed satisfaction with this report.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] All newspapers in Paris unanimously stated that after the talks between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Hansky, the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement to jointly resist aggression is almost a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax has returned to the country from Geneva, bringing with him proposals regarding the Anglo-Soviet agreement. The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet before "Pentecost" (i.e., today) to consider the proposals. It is expected that as soon as the British Cabinet makes a decision, it will notify Moscow. As for the basis of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Geneva, it was already established in London. According to the Times, the above-mentioned basis is roughly in line with the compromise plan proposed by France, which includes: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration stating that any act of aggression against one of the allied countries is an aggression against all the allied countries, and the guarantee measures provided by the allied countries to each other will be implemented immediately; (2) Submit a report on various small countries (whether the independence of the countries has been guaranteed or not) in order to divide the Valley Small countries into (A) the scope of interests of Britain and France, (B) the scope of interests of the Soviet Union; (3) Establish a method of mutual consultation to deal with unpredictable changes. "Daily Express" also reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax also asked Soviet Ambassador遇斯基 whether he could ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to visit London.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet returned to the country from Geneva in the same car tonight at 力时半. Everyone believed that the British, French, and Soviet mutual assistance agreement must be concluded quickly. People in the British delegation even declared that when the British Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Halifax will report on the negotiations between him and the Soviet representatives, and submit a draft agreement. After the British Cabinet agrees, it will be sent to Moscow to solicit final approval. The agreement will be concluded in the near future. Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Polish representative Komarnicki and Romanian representativeクレシアノ respectively this afternoon, and informed them of the progress of the British and Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Reuters learned from foreign sources in London that Poland and Romania have agreed on the mutual assistance treaty between the two countries for many years, the original purpose of which was to oppose the Soviet Union. It has now been decided to apply it to other aspects of the attack. The general staff of the two countries has held talks to 俾实施 this agreed cooperation method. The two countries have no objection to the establishment of an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but this matter is attached to a condition, that is, Poland and Romania do not have to participate in it, because if Poland and Romania participate in it, some aspects can be interpreted as ×视Germany's actions. As far as Poland is concerned, its relationship with the Soviet Union has been regulated by the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1933.</p>
<p>Bonnet's Talk</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet made a surprising statement about the Anglo-Soviet agreement to Joel. San Owen, a Geneva-based correspondent for the "Paris Evening News." The statement appeared in yesterday's Evening News and read as follows: "I had lengthy talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Sir Halifax, and as a result I am convinced that the ongoing trilateral negotiations will soon come to an end. France has long had an alliance with the Soviet Union. The conclusion of the new trilateral agreement proves the strengthening of our 'collective security system' and is a powerful tool for maintaining peace." San Owen praised Bonnet's活勸 in Geneva, and said that the French government's mediation was based on the following judgments: "Bonnet told the Soviet representative that 'Since there is a 1935 alliance treaty between France and the Soviet Union, giving the Soviet Union guarantees, and Britain and France are 休戚相关countries, all the conditions that the Soviet Union hopes for are in fact already completely there, only waiting for a suitable method to be drafted.' He also said to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, 'Given the existence of the Franco-Soviet agreement and the spirit of mutual assistance between Britain and France, Britain has already indirectly承担的the obligation to assist the Soviet Union.' Bonnet's theory is such that it can enable Britain and the Soviet Union to accept the plan he proposed." "Paris Evening News" also said, "Another treaty will be signed between France and Poland this week. The intention is to define the obligations borne by France and Poland under the outline of the new trilateral agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The same is true between Britain and Poland. As a result, the French plan can be easily implemented." "Paris Evening News" also predicts that the "Hetan" issue between France and 士will be resolved in the next few days. At that time, the Angolan government will be able to participate in the British-French agreement, but Romania's attitude is still uncertain. The雑government's determination to oppose active Soviet aid is still difficult to overcome.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Will Again Request Member States to Provide Actual Assistance to Our War of Resistance; Designates a Committee to Review Our Country's Application; Britain and France Reaffirm Their Determination for International Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] After holding an open meeting this afternoon, the League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting to continue discussions on the Sino-Japanese dispute and draft a resolution. It is reported that the content will declare China as the victim of aggression and again suggest to member states that they provide assistance in various ways.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] At this morning's closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet were unwilling to take further steps beyond implementing past resolutions passed by the League of Nations regarding the proposals made by our country's chief representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, in his speech to the Administrative Council yesterday. At that time, our country's representative insisted on our just and upright position, and the representatives of Poland, New Zealand, and the Soviet Union unanimously expressed their support for our position. The Administrative Council then decided to appoint representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Latvia, and our country to form a drafting committee to review Representative Koo's proposals. However, due to Britain's policy of not wanting to handle any important issues within the League of Nations structure, most people dare not harbor any illusions about whether the League of Nations can agree on concrete measures. The Administrative Council's Drafting Committee is scheduled to meet tonight or tomorrow. Swiss newspapers are currently commenting on yesterday's Administrative Council meeting, and they unanimously express pessimism about the future of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations Committee met today to draft a resolution in response to the application made yesterday by the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The resolution will reaffirm the League's recommendation to member states to provide actual assistance to China's war of resistance. Representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Latvia attended the committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated today that Britain has shouldered its obligations, "the purpose of which is to oppose the use of force, as the use of force will inevitably plunge civilization into anarchy." He did not disclose anything about the British-Soviet negotiations, but stated that, under these circumstances, it is impossible to implement the British government's actions within the League of Nations, so it can only strictly adhere to the principles of the League of Nations. He also said that after the British-Soviet negotiations are completed, the results will be notified to the League of Nations, and emphasized that the British government adheres to the ideal of international cooperation, and the League of Nations is a symbol of this cooperation. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also made a similar statement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations Administrative Council has decided that the League of Nations' relationship with Danzig will not be changed in any way and has instructed the League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig to return to his post and explain the current situation to the Danzig Senate.</p>
<h3>### The Danzig Issue: The League of Nations' Three-Nation Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations' Three-Nation Committee has decided to specially send the High Commissioner of the city of Danzig, Burckhardt, back to the city to submit a formal report on the truth of the situation there. People close to the French delegation compared Burckhardt's mission today to Sir Neill Malcolm's trip to Czechoslovakia last year, whose task was to determine whether the re-incorporation of Danzig into Germany was "the only reasonable solution to the Danzig issue." Political figures here seem to think that "the Danzig issue is not worth a war," but the Polish delegation is quite dissatisfied with the current trend of events.</p>
<h3>### The Issue of Fortifying the Åland Islands Remains Unresolved; The Soviet Union Fears Falling into German Hands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] The issue of fortifying the Åland Islands has not been resolved to this day due to the obstruction of the Soviet representative. According to League of Nations officials, the Soviet side believes that if the island is fortified, it will sooner or later become a German naval base. It is reported that Soviet Ambassador Maisky once said that the Finnish army is pro-German, and in the event of war, the Finns will hand over the island to Germany. Representatives of the Scandinavian countries opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to transfer the island to the next session of the autumn conference for discussion. The Soviet representative officially stated that he could not change his attitude without consulting his own government. Political figures here are at a loss as to the current stalemate, but it is generally believed that at tomorrow's meeting, representatives of the Scandinavian countries will again oppose the Soviet Union's discussion of the case.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The issue of fortifying the Baltic Sea's Åland Islands was originally on the agenda of the League of Nations Administrative Council. After the Finnish government refused to notify the Soviet Union of detailed plans, the Soviet government recently ordered its representative to the League of Nations, Maisky, to request the Administrative Council to postpone the discussion. An announcement was also issued here stating that the Åland Islands are not far from the Gulf of Finland, and in the event of war in the future, other countries can use them as a base to block the Gulf of Finland and obstruct the entry and exit of Allied warships. It is also said that the issue of fortifying the island is of great importance to the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to notify the Allies of the content of the plan.</p>
<h3>### Germans in Danzig Continue to Agitate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Danzig, 23rd] It is reported that since the incident in Danzig on Sunday, several demonstrations have taken place in several towns. It is reported that Germans in Danzig gathered in front of the Bergiel customs building, loudly denounced the Poles, Nazi stormtroopers demonstrated everywhere, and destroyed the doors and windows of the customs building.</p>
<h3>### U.S. Submarine [Squalus] Sinks After Accident; U.S. Government Stops Rescue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Portsmouth, 23rd] It is reported that the U.S. submarine "Squalus" sank after an accident near White Island. There were 62 people on board. According to reports, the submarine was on a routine underwater patrol at 2:40 PM today (British Standard Time), but after an hour (the usual patrol time for submarines in this situation is one hour), it still failed to surface. The submarine is now 240 feet below the surface of the sea. Its sister submarine "Sculpin" has been ordered to go to the scene of the accident and has been able to exchange messages with the "Squalus." Naval officers say the submarine is equipped with the latest safety equipment, so it can last at least 24 hours in the water. Authorities are now preparing to send divers into the sea to rescue the submarine. The cruiser "Brooklyn" has also been ordered to sail from New York to the scene of the incident. The director of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard said that surface ships can pump air into the "Squalus" so that the crew can survive for a week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Portsmouth, 23rd] President Roosevelt told reporters in Washington today that he believed the crew of the submarine "Squalus" would be rescued. The U.S. government is now doing its best to dispatch personnel and equipment to the scene of the incident to carry out rescue operations. President Roosevelt is now in contact with the area via naval radio and said that the submarine "Squalus" is equipped with "lung" machines, and the crew can use these "lungs" to float to the surface, but this measure will not be taken unless absolutely necessary. He is trying to make the entire submarine float. The sea surface is calm and the rescue work is going smoothly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the cause of the accident of the U.S. submarine "Squalus" is unknown. It is believed that the ship is now stranded on the seabed. Its sister ship "Sculpin" is now cruising the scene of the incident. The submarine rescue ship "Falcon" has rushed from New England to assist. It is verified that the Squalus is a newly built submarine in the United States, which was completed on May 1st. It was practicing sailing on the same day after completion. It departed from Portsmouth at 6:00 yesterday morning and was originally scheduled to return to port at 9:40 AM, but suddenly disappeared. Its sister ship Sculpin immediately went to investigate and finally found its location at 12:30 PM and immediately sent a radio request for assistance.</p>

<h3>### Wimbledon Car Accident: Queen Mary Slightly Injured; British King and Queen Arrive in Lake City</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The car carrying Queen Mary was hit by a truck in Wimbledon this afternoon. Fortunately, the Queen was not injured, but the royal physicians all hoped that the Queen would rest for twelve hours. The Queen's scheduled appointments have been cancelled and will be suspended to Epsom. According to eyewitnesses, the Queen's car collided with a truck, causing it to overturn. Fortunately, a painter nearby moved his ladder against the car, and the Queen was able to walk out of the car. The Queen and her lady-in-waiting were violently shaken by the car collision. Later, the Queen went to the residence of a nearby doctor for a short rest. When she drove away, the crowd cheered her, and the Queen smiled in return.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shreveport, 23rd] When the British King and Queen arrived in Shreveport, they learned of the news of Queen Mary's car accident. The British King told a member of the welcoming committee here that the Queen was only slightly injured and there was no need to worry too much. It is not known whether the British King has telephoned London. The British King and Queen have now traveled to Lake City and are expected to arrive at approximately 11:00 PM (British Standard Time).</p>
<h3>### Palestine Issue: British House of Commons Notified; Government White Paper; Opposition's Motion to Amend Rejected; House of Lords Also Approves Government Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British House of Commons continued to debate the Palestine issue today. Opposition Labor Party member Morrison criticized the government for breaking its promises and acting dishonorably. He said that the White Paper published by the British government contradicted previous declarations. The British government had promised the Jews to return to Palestine and restore their homeland, but now the status of the Jews has been reduced to a permanent minority. The Colonial Secretary has not announced how to protect Jewish civil rights, and the Jews will be sacrificed due to the British government's inability to govern and fear of assassination and violence. When the British government and the House of Commons finally draft a policy, they should not conflict with the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement and should seek the opinion of the Hague Arbitration Court. Most of the difficult situations in Palestine are caused by a minority among certain classes of Arabs, which may have been instigated by agents of Hitler and Mussolini. The British government's policy on resolving the Palestine issue should focus on the cooperation between the Arab and Jewish peoples to maintain order in the area. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, specifically pointing out that the White Paper was inconsistent with the Mandate Agreement. He argued that the government should discuss this matter with the Mandates Commission. Independent Labor Party member Maxton strongly opposed the government's White Paper. Conservative Party member Churchill also opposed the government's proposal. He said that the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement have been destroyed by the government's proposal. The opposition's motion to amend the government's plan was rejected by a vote of 281 to 181. The government's plan was passed by a majority of 268 to 179. The House of Lords also agreed to the government's plan and approved the White Paper policy.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>About the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Our country's representative to the League of Nations, Wellington Koo, proposed five points to the General Assembly: (1) Financial aid to China; (2) Do not supply Japan with military supplies; (3) Restrict imports of Japanese goods; (4) Establish an adjustment committee to handle the above matters and other sanctions against Japan; (5) Establish a committee to investigate the truth of Japan's indiscriminate bombing of Chinese civilians.</p>
<p>These five points are the responsibility of all democratic and peaceful countries today, and they are also within their power to do. In order to protect China's territorial sovereignty and also for the safety of democratic and peaceful countries themselves.</p>
<p>We certainly cannot have any extravagant hopes for the current League of Nations, and the League of Nations' prestige among people around the world is declining daily. However, the League of Nations is still the only existing international organization that upholds League of Nations justice and peaceful order. Passing all appeals through the League of Nations is naturally easier for democratic and peaceful countries and people of peace and justice around the world to accept and implement.</p>
<p>Therefore, although we dare not agree with those so-called League of Nations liaison theorists who rely on the League of Nations, we must also point out all arguments that excessively underestimate or even curse the League of Nations. We should warmly support Representative Wellington Koo's presentation of five demands and his impassioned speech.</p>
<p>According to a Geneva dispatch, the League of Nations Administrative Council met on the 23rd to draft a resolution in response to Representative Koo's proposal, which will reaffirm the League of Nations' urging of member states to provide practical assistance to our country's war of resistance. This kind of resolution is within our expectations! We should not only point out that those pessimistic arguments and curses of the League of Nations are unfounded, but also respectfully salute the representatives of the four countries on the drafting committee: Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Latvia.</p>
<p>In the future, we should further base ourselves on this resolution and the five points raised by Representative Koo to demand that people from all countries, public opinion circles from all over the world, and governments of all countries earnestly and conscientiously implement them! We must expand international publicity with the facts of our internal close cooperation to promote political development, strengthen the economy, and persist in the war of resistance in order to win more and greater foreign friends.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and His Wife Fly to Japan</h3>
<p>On the 23rd, the Central News Agency published news about Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun flying to Japan on the 5th of this month. This news of Wang × going to Japan, which had been widely circulated in newspapers everywhere a few days earlier, can be mutually verified. We can see even more clearly what the background of all of Wang's remarks is - there were still a few people who trusted and cherished Wang too much in the past, hoping day and night that Wang would ultimately not disappoint the expectations of the people of the country, and even tried to explain Wang's remarks from a good perspective, but now they should also sigh and say that the words of the ancient sages were not wrong: "Now, in my dealings with men, I hear their words and observe their actions"! In fact, in his remarks, where did he not reveal his true colors!</p>
<p>From the news announced by the Central News Agency, we can also see that there is a rumor that Chen Gongbo does not approve of Wang's actions and intends to sever his relationship with Wang. Before there are facts to prove it, we certainly cannot make a hasty judgment, but Wang's actions not only violate the major plans of the party and the country and harm the national people, but also greatly violate "Chinese morality." Among those who usually plot and follow Wang, are there few wise men who cherish themselves? Can they also slightly sense the Central Government's months of seeking opinions and the final expectations of the entire people and return to the right path?</p>
<p>Japanese × harassment of China has encountered new and insurmountable difficulties. The recent sharp drop in the Japanese currency also shows one aspect of this. They are now trying to step up the robbery and oppression of the occupied territories, and to achieve this, the first step is to establish a more powerful puppet regime. Therefore, Wang is still the most appropriate tool for the Japanese × today. Everyone should carefully monitor Wang's future activities!</p>

<h3>Two × Warships Forcibly Board a British Shipping Vessel South of Waglan Island and Carry Out Harassment; Firing Shots as a Threat, Ordering the Ranpura to Stop Sailing; British Warships and Seaplanes Rush to the Rescue and Drive Them Away; British Commander Witnesses the Incident on Board: Will File a Serious Protest</h3>
<p>The British India Steam Navigation Company's Ranpura arrived from Singapore and sailed to the sea off Waglan Island yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Suddenly, it encountered one × cruiser and one destroyer, flying flags to stop its progress. Later, troops were sent to board the ship and carry out harassment. Later, the Hong Kong Naval Commander received a telegram from the ship and immediately dispatched aircraft and warships to the rescue, and the incident ended. It is found that × forces have been ambushing and harassing neutral ships in and out of Hong Kong's territorial waters, and robbing them under various pretexts, countless times. The number of merchant ships that have been robbed is countless, and the Ranpura is the first of the large ocean liners traveling between Europe and the Far East to be harassed by × warships. The details obtained after boarding the Ranpura upon its arrival in Hong Kong are as follows:</p>
<p>Commanders Maby and Beattie Accompany the Ship to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Ranpura is a 16,688-ton ocean liner, one of the largest ships under the British India Steam Navigation Company's fleet on the Europe-Far East route. It departed from Singapore yesterday and was carrying Rear Admiral Lyster, the newly appointed Fifth Fleet Commander in the Far East, and Beattie, the newly appointed Hong Kong Naval Commander, who jointly boarded the ship to Hong Kong. Lyster's mission on this trip is to assist Admiral Noble, the British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, in managing the British fleet in China. Beattie is coming to Hong Kong to take over as Hong Kong Naval Commander, as the current Commander Daker is about to complete his term. Therefore, both men witnessed everything on board the Ranpura yesterday when it was searched.</p>
<p>Encountered × Warships South of Waglan Island</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the Ranpura was sailing in the sea four nautical miles south of Waglan Island, one mile outside Hong Kong's territorial waters. It was about to display its flag to report the lighthouse on the island and then sail past. Suddenly, one × destroyer came face to face and flew its flag to stop its progress. Next to the destroyer was one × cruiser, flying the flag of a rear admiral. For safety reasons, the ship immediately obeyed the order to stop and sent an urgent telegram to Hong Kong to report the incident to the Hong Kong Navy. The × warship sent a motorboat with three naval officers and one signalman to the Ranpura. They rushed on board and went straight to the shipmaster's cabin. One of the officers asked the shipmaster if it was a British merchant ship, where it was sailing, where it came from, and what kind of cargo it was carrying, and forced him to show the ship's registration papers. The shipmaster refused due to the unreasonable inspection.</p>
<p>Three British Warships Ordered to Sail to the Rescue</p>
<p>While the × warship was carrying out harassment, the Hong Kong Navy had already received the ship's telegram and immediately ordered three warships, including HMS Duchess, which were nearby on exercises, to sail to the scene to assist. At the same time, a British seaplane that was practicing in the airspace above Lei Yue Mun also saw the Ranpura being forced to stop and knew that an accident had occurred. It immediately flew forward and circled the Ranpura once, flying low to inspect the × warship. Knowing that Hong Kong had sent aircraft and warships to assist, it did not dare to linger and immediately hoisted its flag, ordering the four × officers and soldiers who had boarded the ship to leave quickly. The × soldiers harassed the ship for about half an hour before leaving. The Ranpura also set sail and returned to Hong Kong at 8:45 AM, traveling at a speed of 24 knots per hour. It arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and berthed at the Kowloon Wharf.</p>
<p>All Crew Members on Board Expressed Anger</p>
<p>When reporters boarded the ship yesterday to investigate, the crew members on board all expressed their anger at the Ranpura's search. They told reporters that the incident was as described above, and said that the flag hoisted by the × warship was a warning signal, indicating that if the ship did not stop, it would fire its guns. At the same time, it fired a shot as a warning. The shipmaster paid attention to the flag it was flying and ordered the ship to stop for safety reasons. The name of the × warship that intercepted and searched the ship this time was not noted. After the incident, when the ship was about to return to Hong Kong, the three British warships that had been sent to assist had already arrived like flying, and the warning flags were flying on the warships, ordering the × army to immediately leave the ship. Therefore, the × warship hurriedly signaled, and after the × soldiers left the ship, they were escorted back to Hong Kong by the three warships. Fortunately, there were no other losses in this incident, and the passengers on board were very calm.</p>
<p>Two Warning Shots Fired; Bullets Flew Past the Ship</p>
<p>According to a passenger, when the incident occurred, many passengers were on deck preparing to eat breakfast. Suddenly, they saw a Japanese warship two stars away from the ship. When it was about one mile away, the Japanese warship hoisted its flag, ordering the ship to stop. After the ship traveled about half a mile, the Japanese warship suddenly fired two shots, the bullets flew past the ship, and then it blew its horn, ordering it to stop. The ship then stopped about 400 yards away from the warship. Soon, Japanese soldiers were seen boarding the ship on a motorboat. The Japanese soldiers were on the ship for about 20 minutes. A British seaplane arrived in the air and flew low to scout. Before long, the Japanese soldiers left the ship and returned to the warship.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Air Force Plane Crashes into the Sea; All Three Pilots Luckily Rescued</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Hong Kong Telegraph reported that an Air Force plane was piloted by Mr. Howes a few days ago, with two airmen on board, namely a Mr. Taff and a Mr. Bruss, when flying from overseas to Hong Kong, suddenly broke down and was forced to descend and crashed into the sea. The three men hurried out and climbed onto the plane's wings and were soon rescued. As for whether the plane has sunk, the Air Force authorities are still silent.</p>
<h3>Dongguan-Hong Kong Cargo Boat Robbed by Pirates; Police Solve Case and Arrest Four Suspects After Two Months</h3>
<p>On March 27th of this year, a cargo boat was robbed by a large vessel in the waters of Wanqing Sha outside Hong Kong. The people on board were forced ashore and the boat was seized. After receiving the news, the Hong Kong police immediately launched a search and finally recovered the boat the night before last. At the same time, four suspected men were arrested on board.</p>
<p>Wanqing Sha Waters: Sudden Encounter with Pirate Boat</p>
<p>Guo Jindi (45 years old), the owner of cargo boat No. 3425, reported to the police station that on March 22nd of this year, she was hired to sail from Zhongyuan Village in Dongguan to Hong Kong. The boat was loaded with 280 bundles of water hyacinth, worth over 1,900 silver dollars, as well as a coffin and two boatmen. The journey was smooth until about 3 p.m. on March 27th, when a fishing boat weighing 1,000 dan suddenly appeared in the waters of Wanqing Sha. Guo, suspecting it was up to no good, intended to sail away, but realizing they were in the vast ocean with no escape, she pretended to be calm. When the pirate boat was close enough, it forced them to stop.</p>
<p>Submissive Boat Owner: Cargo Boat Seized</p>
<p>Guo, realizing she was in a dangerous situation, outnumbered by the pirates, dared not resist and allowed them to do as they pleased. There were six pirates on the boat, all armed with guns and very fierce. Four pirates jumped onto her boat, threatened everyone with their guns, and forced her to sail the boat close to the shore near Wanqing Sha. They drove everyone ashore and then seized the boat, sailing towards British territory. After being forced ashore, Guo and the others tried to get to Hong Kong as quickly as possible and reported the incident to the police station. After receiving the report, the police immediately sent water police patrol boats to search the coast. However, the pirates appeared and disappeared unpredictably. Despite the authorities' efforts for a long time, they were unable to capture the bandits.</p>
<p>Pirate Gang Smashed: Four Arrested</p>
<p>The night before last, the police sent out a large team of detectives to search. As a result, they found a suspicious cargo boat in the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter. Upon investigation, they confirmed that it was the same boat reported by Guo Jindi. At the same time, there were suspicious men on board who were arrested. In addition, a certain water police patrol boat was patrolling the sea the night before last and found a certain cargo boat adrift on the sea, with no one on board. The boat was loaded with grass mats and other items. The water police boat towed it back to Hong Kong and reported the case. Whether the boat was robbed, or the people on board were murdered or engaged in smuggling, is still unknown. The authorities are currently conducting a secret investigation.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Market: The Japanese Yen Even Worse</h3>
<p>The collapse of the Japanese yen is even more evident in the Hong Kong market. The reporter inquired at three money exchange counters in the city center about buying yen. The first quoted 51 cents of Hong Kong silver per yen, the second quoted 54 cents, and the third quoted 58 cents. The first quote (which means the yen is worth only half its face value) stated that they had a large amount of Japanese currency in stock. The official price of the Bank of Taiwan in Hong Kong is 94 cents. The degree to which the yen's price has fallen in the "black market" is even greater in Hong Kong than in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Financial Commentary: Exposing the Japanese, Who Suffer the Consequences of Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>The Japanese have been invading China for two years, and their troops are mired and exhausted. To make a final struggle, they have launched so-called economic and currency wars. For example, after the failure of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank in North China, they ignited the "star" of the puppet China Development Bank in Shanghai, which is one aspect of their desperate measures. The Japanese have repeatedly declared that the banknotes of this puppet bank will engage in a final duel with our legal tender. Regardless of how sinister their intentions may be, all knowledgeable people, both Chinese and foreign, sneer at it and believe that it will inevitably fail. As expected, the bank had not even been established for a month before the counterfeit currency was severely damaged as soon as it appeared, with its market price only 66% of the legal tender. Even the Japanese yen, which was considered the only support, also plummeted and crashed, falling by eight pence. It can be said that hurting others is hurting oneself. However, this matter is only just beginning and will inevitably become worse in the future. According to the "Financial Review Monthly," the fate of this bank and its counterfeit currency will be the same as that of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank in North China (see the article "New Conspiracy of Japan to Destroy Legal Tender" by Shi Yiwenzhi in the June issue of the journal). The article's arguments are precise, its analysis is detailed, its exposure of hidden facts is thorough, and its insights are profound. Therefore, it can hit the nail on the head and leave them with nowhere to hide. The journal has translated many articles by Japanese writers such as Kimura Matsuoka Yamazaki on the Sino-Japanese currency war, which can be compared and viewed, and the more you look at it, the more you will see the embarrassing situation of their painstaking efforts being in vain. In addition, there are papers by Jia Shiyi, Wu Gan, Yao Qingsan, Wei Youfei, etc., which are all related to wartime finance and economics and are of great value. They are now published in Hong Kong and are available at major bookstores.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association Holds Costume Carnival Yesterday; Madam Soong Ching-ling Presides Over Lottery; Mrs. Vibart Lectures on the History of Clothing</h3>
<p>The costume carnival organized by the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association was held for the first time yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. on the open space to the left of the Peninsula Hotel. The weather was clear and sunny, and the sun was scorching, but Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen led children to participate in the event in an endless stream. Vehicles came and went in front of the door, as dense as weaving. It is estimated that more than a thousand people attended the event that day, with a total income of about two thousand dollars. The entire venue was covered with bamboo mats, and the construction cost was paid by Yang Yongkang. To the left and right of the entrance, there were more than a dozen game rooms, including coconut throwing, darts, ladder climbing, wooden horses, human-headed fish, pot throwing, fishing pond, small zoo, bear man, ring throwing, and toy soldiers. In the center was a music stage, and the outer perimeter was a race track. The costume performance room was in the stone corner of the venue, and the refreshment area was next to it. The children who attended the event that day were very happy to participate in the games, especially the horse riding and slide sections, which were the most lively. Because of the hot weather, the guests were very thirsty, and the two tea and water stations had a lot of customers. At 3:30 p.m., the costume performance began to enter. The admission fee was one or two dimes. Government lawyer Abbott personally came to the venue to welcome everyone, and his wife gave a lecture in English on the history of various costumes in the venue, which was very informative. The Chinese interpretation was provided by Dr. He Ailing. Those who entered to watch were packed like sardines, and those who arrived later could not get in. At 5:30 p.m., the lottery draw was held, presided over by Madam Soong Ching-ling and the wife of a musical nobleman. The results of the draw are as follows: first prize of the 50-cent lottery ticket, 935, a wristwatch; (2) 302, a camera; (3) 918, a large doll; (4) 480; (5) 934; prizes for the 20-cent lottery ticket: (1) 912, a children's bicycle; (2) 219, a doll bed; (3) 25, a bottle of water; (4) 100; (5) 230; entrance ticket prize: 357, two entertainment tickets; order award: 63, two after-theater tickets.

<h3>[Comic Strip] On the Streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon</h3>
<p>— Yu Wan</p>
<p>The Lower Class Society… Their Spiritual Food is in Short Supply</p>
<p>It is the streets of early summer. When the hard-working masses are suffocated in buildings crowded with twenty or thirty people on each floor, after dinner, the sound of wooden clogs on the streets, although not drowning out the noise of cars and motorcycles, the city's movement is at its most intense at this time of early evening. Sheung Wan, Central, up and down the mountain, New Territories Kowloon, coming and going, are they not all shiny cars? However, the hard-working masses under their control, they drag their wooden clogs, baring their chests, they do not have the fortune to throw money around. They roam the streets. Apart from drinking two cents worth of "cool tea", they have to go near the wall to read "comic strips".</p>
<p>In a corner of oblique sunlight, or in front of a grocery store, you will see a wooden frame three to five feet high, a few empty milk cartons. Some of the wooden frames may be filled with "complete" sets, while others may just have the book cover. The milk carton is full of books, one after another. The cover, although without a design of patterns, the colors are considered complex - yellow and green: Liang Shanbo Zhu Yingtai, Purple Sand Cup, Tianqi Accusation, Burning Hongyun Temple, Wu Song Fighting the Tiger, Tang Seng Taking the Scriptures, Seven Heroes and Thirteen Knights, Jiang Taigong Met King Wen at Eighty, Ma Jiepu, Bao Gong's Strange Cases, Jade-Faced Fox... The more modern ones include Beauty Replacing the Country, Diao Chan, Zhong Wuyan, Sixty Years Later in Shanghai, Chu Overlord, A Mu Lin... The so-called modernity is perhaps related to the most recent movies - to put it beautifully, these hundreds of books are almost street miniature picture galleries. They set up ten or so small wooden benches less than five inches high and a foot long. The seats are often full. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, even those who are illiterate, they lie back, squatting, flipping through page after page. After dusk, although the number of readers is slightly less, there are still many who are focused and engrossed, chasing after volume after volume, upper and lower volumes.</p>
<p>Gas lights illuminated the audience of the entire book stall - from their eyebrows, they showed an attitude of "upholding justice", from their lip smacking, they showed a smile of "divine couple"! "Bitterness ends and sweetness comes", "vengeance for grievances", they were experiencing it. They have struggled half their lives in capitalist exploitation, they have worked hard with their hands and feet, they still dream of "bitterness ends and sweetness comes" - they may want to resist fate, but they fear the arrival of "retribution".</p>
<p>The people who browse through comic books, especially the children who are immersed in it. In the morning, adults have to work, and the children are the world in front of the small bookstore - about six or seven in the morning! What you see may be all children aged eight or nine to fifteen or sixteen, including primary school students, packed together like ants. The short stools are not enough, the wooden boxes, and even the schoolbags are full. One cent to rent four books, one cent to rent eight books, the newly released ones (actually, newly arrived ones) are two cents each. They take the string from their mother's pocket and hand it over like a tax. Primary school students, they will also have money for fruit, bait, pens, and ink to come and see these fascinating books.</p>
<p>Last year, news came from Hong Kong that three young men, aged twelve or thirteen, secretly left their lovely home and agreed to seek immortality. As a result, they climbed the mountain in vain and first plucked up the courage to walk through the tunnel of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway... Later, they were finally discovered by their families and stopped. This was a gift from "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" - they have the spirit of Robinson Crusoe, but they lack the training of Boy Scouts. What they usually come into contact with are bizarre and exaggerated comic books!</p>
<p>A few years ago, some people launched an initiative to improve comic books, and quite a few have already been published. Unfortunately, what you see in the market is still as rare as morning stars after a few years! The ghosts and monsters in comic books in the streets and alleys are still filling the streets! Intellectuals in the War of Resistance should all stand firm in their positions! We must not only improve these feudal, outdated comic books, but also find a way to make them compatible with the "War of Resistance" - there are some, such as "Popular Readings" published by the Popular Readings Publishing House, and "Continuous Stories" published by the Popular Art Publishing House; however, it's like a cup of water trying to put out a burning cart of wood, how can it help? It is said that the catalog of comic books on the streets exceeds ten thousand titles, even if it is five thousand titles, its penetration into people's hearts is no different from floods and fierce beasts!</p>
<p>The masses in the corner are in urgent need of education. The children on the short stools are a new foundation for the nation's life! However, under the gas lamp, in the shadow of dawn, what we see is ultimately a group that is being misled!</p>

<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>We feel indescribably happy to be able to meet you all in Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>For the past two years, we have traveled through many cities and villages in our homeland amidst the flames of war. Every day, we lived with countless heroic brothers and the struggling masses amidst bombing and Japanese artillery fire. If our work is to educate soldiers and the people, it is better to say that the people and the heroic soldiers are educating us.</p>
<p>After working in the war for 20 months, we felt our own weakness and always wanted to contribute more to our country, so we made the decision to promote our cause abroad.</p>
<p>Now, because we are passing through Hong Kong, we have the opportunity to put on the stage some of the plays we brought back from the battlefield. In terms of stage technology, we are still children learning to walk and eagerly waiting for guidance from the audience in Hong Kong, so that we can learn more. We will use flat ground, high mountains, trenches, and wheat fields as temporary stages in the front line to perform these plays, and millions of brave soldiers will be our dearest audience. They pour all their energy into carefully listening to the words of the characters in the play. At that time, the earth was extremely quiet, and we felt a kind of spiritual communication. When Japanese planes came, everyone would lie down together. After the Japanese planes left, we continued our play. Once, in Shangcheng, Henan, we performed "When the Bastards are Gone!", which was mainly about military-civilian cooperation, to entertain a division of General Shang Zhian's troops who were about to go to the front line. The brothers were all sitting neatly on the ground in a large open square. Halfway through the play, it suddenly started to rain heavily. At that time, we discussed with an officer of the division that in order to prevent the brothers from getting wet, we were willing to walk 30 miles to the barracks to perform again tomorrow. The officer stood on the high ground and asked, "Comrades of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, because you are afraid that our brothers will get wet in the rain, you are willing to go to our barracks to perform again tomorrow, are you going back now?" "No!" This was the loud reply from the brothers. "We will keep watching!" It was the second loud shout. We were moved by this sound, and everyone did their best to perform on stage. The brothers had no rain gear, and they watched the two-hour play in the heavy rain without moving. When they returned in an orderly line, they sang the song "Compatriots are being slaughtered, and our land is being forcibly occupied!" This song moved us to tears and made us feel that our work enthusiasm and efforts were not enough. In some poor and remote inland areas, when those simple and innocent farmers, regardless of men, women, old, or young, loved us so much, we felt that we had never been loved by the audience so much. In the Dabie Mountains, the farmers came to see our plays from 40 or 50 miles away, supporting the old and young, and carrying rice. After watching the play, they would cook and eat next to the stage, and sleep under the wooden stage the next day to continue watching. They often expressed their enthusiasm for us with a few bowls of coarse tea and a few eggs. We felt that these were more precious than anything else, and they could give us encouragement and comfort.</p>
<p>There were several times when we almost sacrificed ourselves in Japanese bombing raids. In Xuzhou, especially in Songbu, the target of the Japanese planes was only a few meters away from the stage. As a result, a brave theater worker was sacrificed, and one of our group was injured, but we continued to perform shortly afterward.</p>
<p>We will soon be going abroad to work. We will extend our hands to those millions of overseas Chinese whose hearts are linked to the motherland and tell them that the motherland is fighting - fighting to the end, victory is ours.</p>
<p>During our short stay in Hong Kong, we are very happy to have an opportunity to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Sector Disaster Relief Association and do our best to help the wounded soldiers and refugees. At the same time, I still believe that the audience in Hong Kong will definitely give us great encouragement.</p>
<p>Many people from the cultural and theater circles have given us a lot of encouragement and guidance in our work. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to them here.</p>
<p>At a discussion meeting of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe, I met this group of battle-hardened theater soldiers. In their nearly two years of arduous work of exile and relocation, I did not meet them in the front line, nor did I meet them in the rear. I only met them when they were passing through this comfortable Hong Kong on their way to promote their cause abroad, and when I had not achieved any results in my work. Under such circumstances, Mr. Jinshan still wanted to express his respect to the workers who stayed in Hong Kong on behalf of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, and the chairman also hoped that I could say something. At that time, it was like a sharp thorn suddenly pierced into my back. A feeling of extreme shame made me unable to suppress the increased beating of my heart and the rapid breathing, and I almost became mute. I felt that apart from listening to the lessons, all my words could not be said, and there was no need to say them again. This thorn has been staying on my back. Only by increasing my pace and intensifying my work, maybe there is hope of removing it; otherwise, if I abandon my responsibility and fail, then it will always remain on my back, piercing straight into my heart and becoming an "incurable" "terminal illness"!</p>
<p>If I still have the courage to say something, I can only shout: Long live the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation! Long live the fighting spirit of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe! But I will no longer shout "Long live the China National Salvation Drama Troupe" because our fight is certainly continuous, but I firmly believe that the final victory is in sight. At that time, we will fight to build a new China, not to "save the country."</p>
<p>Raising my voice from the busy and overwhelming work that makes people excited and also overly tired, it is really difficult to say what is most appropriate. I only hope that the coming out of "China Relief" can let the compatriots in Hong Kong know more about the unbearability of the "thorn", and pay more attention to the disasters of the motherland. Take on some responsibilities, and only by taking the fighting spirit of "China Relief" as our spirit, can we not let down being a good son or daughter of China!</p>
<p>Finally, let me shout out loud again:</p>
<p>Long live the fighting spirit of "China Relief"!</p>
<h3>Long Live the Nation! Long Live the Chinese Salvation! A Performance in Hong Kong Dedicated to the Chinese Salvation</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>Immediately after the Hong Kong theatrical community jointly performed "Huanghuagang," before the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe had the chance to go abroad, they staged "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. This signifies that theatrical work is enriching the united front, aligning its efforts with the demands of the war of resistance and serving the victory of national liberation—the theatrical work serving the war of resistance is expanding and deepening daily.</p>
<p>The comrades of the Chinese Salvation have long recognized and established a glorious tradition in the quantity of their plays. Since August 13th, they have undertaken a Long March of over ten thousand miles, educating the masses while learning from them. Abandoning the previous performance methods in large cities, they used their knowledge of drama and technical mastery to imbue the living, bloody reality with new forms through collective and correct understanding, organically making it an inseparable and indispensable part of the war of resistance. This work experience has forged them into a team of iron and steel, and it is also this work experience that makes them worthy of the admiration and learning of general drama workers.</p>
<p>The plays staged by the Chinese Salvation this time are for urban audiences. Not only has the content selected been the most quintessential works, but also technically, they are enough to make the general audience, who do not yet understand drama, extremely fond of it, and even become supporters of anti-Japanese war drama. Therefore, this performance not only strengthens the propaganda of the war of resistance and serves wounded soldiers and refugees but also expands the realm of dramatic effect and influence, making more people concretely and deeply aware that national salvation is the responsibility of every Chinese person.</p>
<p>In the work experience of the Chinese Salvation, there are many aspects that the theatrical community staying in Hong Kong can refer to and learn from: a serious life, continuous self-education, hard work, and the spirit of struggle to dedicate all efforts to the establishment of a new China!</p>

<h3>Expectations from Gold Mountain</h3>
<p>— Luo Qiu</p>
<p>The era is advancing like a rushing river. The alarm bells of the times are ringing loudly in our ears. This era does not tolerate "corruption" because "corruption" will hinder the progress of the times. China today has come to a great era of revival, and at the same time, it is also a dangerous and terrible era. However, we will not allow China to sink. On the contrary, we will do our utmost to support and aid the glorious final victory of the motherland. We, the drama creators, should dedicate ourselves to the extensive promotion and development of anti-Japanese war drama with loyalty and purity.</p>
<p>As a new force in anti-Japanese war drama—the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe—we anticipate them as we anticipate the victory of the war of resistance. Everyone knows that this new force comes from the mainland. The head of the troupe is Mr. Jinshan, the deputy head is Ms. Wang Ying, and there is also a military expert, Mr. Lin Shu.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan's first statement was, "The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe's arrival overseas is to fully introduce the numerous facts of the war of resistance within the country to overseas Chinese, to make them realize that the war of resistance will surely be victorious and that China definitely has a way." Therefore, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe conducts very strict and serious training for every script and every role. After each play is performed, they invite General Lin Shu to provide a detailed and thorough systematic explanation of the military and political situation of the war of resistance. At the same time, they screen war of resistance films and exhibit war of resistance photos. Mr. Jinshan explained this fiery enthusiasm passionately to everyone at several receptions.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan's second statement was, "We are like cultural sentries. After we go abroad, there will be many situations. We hope that cultural comrades in the mainland and Hong Kong will support us and give us more guidance." Yes, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe is not only a cultural sentry but also goes beyond being a sentry. We call them cultural vanguards. We hope that they will win victories in the front lines. First, our drama must develop and expand abroad; second, our overseas Chinese must know more about the motherland and donate more money. ××××××, we will continue until the final victory. We respect Mr. Jinshan's humility and courtesy. We cannot express enough how we wish to be in Hong Kong and never forget the good news of the Salvation Drama Troupe.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan's third statement was, "We will go to Nanyang first, then Singapore, and then the Americas. We hope to constantly hear news of victory along the way." Mr. Jinshan strives on one hand and thinks about the motherland on the other. Although his body is overseas, his heart is with the motherland. This spirit of fighting and love for the motherland will make those who run away, surrender, and ×××××××××× die of shame! Mr. Jinshan is striving to advance. The motherland will surely win, and the motherland will surely rise from the arduous struggle!</p>
<p>The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe led by Mr. Jinshan is about to perform in Hong Kong. In addition to introducing them to the overseas Chinese, we recommend them to the people of Hong Kong. If you want to watch plays, go to the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe. This is a truly authentic art, not a commercial one, and it is permeated with the issue of war resistance and is 100% based on facts.</p>

<h3>"Chinese Salvation" on the Theatrical Front</h3>
<p>— Ming Xi</p>
<p>Overcoming difficulties requires strong perseverance. What creates this strong perseverance is an upward, optimistic, and non-disappointing spirit. This spirit comes from our unbreakable confidence, which is "China will not perish" and "Final victory will surely belong to us." For twenty months, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe has overcome all difficulties, learning in the war of resistance, training in the war of resistance, growing and strengthening in the war of resistance, and at the same time, enabling their weapon—drama—to exert its greatest effectiveness in the work of national salvation. This can be said to be mutually causal.</p>
<p>The Japanese are plotting against us in every possible way, leaving no stone unturned. If we were to have a complete reckoning with the Japanese, and if this war of resistance is of course the time for that reckoning, then the people who carry out this reckoning work cannot be done by simple, scattered organizations alone. And the widespread performance of drama cannot exert its great effect in the same way as urban performances in the past. A disciplined organization is necessary to complete the expected tasks. We can still remember that after "August 13th," several salvation drama troupes set off one after another. How many still exist alone? I am not saying that those non-existent groups have lost their fighting power, but I am indicating that the continued existence of this Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe, which has evolved from the salvation drama troupe, and its ability to gradually grow up is not accidental, but inevitable.</p>
<p>The old urban drama groups were always inevitably scattered and short-lived, and the individual's life inevitably became accustomed to the romance of artists, and even the idea of showing off and dabbling was mixed in. Those groups or individuals who are still struggling on the drama front are absolutely unacceptable, and there is naturally no possibility of their existence. Although they are not completely the same as the army, they are at least similar—strict organization, disciplined life, harmonious emotions, and deep understanding. The old things are not enough to cope with the environment, and new things will continue to be learned. This infinite experience is the gunpowder storehouse of the essence of the war of attrition. "Chinese Salvation" is fighting on one side and continuing to enrich their gunpowder storehouse on the other side. The gunpowder of experience is not consumed but only grows.</p>
<p>What I saw in the workers of Chinese Salvation was simplicity and robustness. What I heard in their conversations was sincerity and richness of experience. What I know about their organization and life, the plays I am about to see, I will gain infinite impressions, infinite satisfactory impressions, and indelible impressions. But we cannot forget that this performance by "Chinese Salvation" is a preparation for their overseas propaganda, and they are using a new strategy according to the time and place. The few thousand dollars spent on scenery and costumes is not a waste. They want to make full use of it to achieve the expected effect. Performing drama in the countryside and performing in the city are different. In other words, performing in the countryside cannot be used in urban drama anymore. However, working for the goal of "national salvation" is consistent.</p>
<p>Living and working in hardship, difficulty, danger, and hardship, under siege, is not only fighting with the Japanese, but also fighting with these hardships. Chinese Salvation, which has been established for twenty months, has won. They have not received any reward, but, really, have they not? Yes, the freedom of the motherland and the freedom of 450 million compatriots will be the reward received by everyone working on the front line.</p>
<h3>What I Saw During Rehearsals</h3>
<p>— Lin Shu</p>
<p>What is placed before the audience is the brutal behavior of the Japanese that is utterly inhumane: it is the resistance movement of the sons and daughters of China that moves heaven and earth and makes ghosts and gods weep. On one hand, it expresses the destruction of the world, and on the other hand, it expresses the dawn of humanity. Two absolutely opposite forces are fighting. I want to weep for the dead compatriots, but I absolutely refuse to weep. I would rather shed blood several more times and sweep away these demons together. This is my feeling after seeing the Battle of Taierzhuang once.</p>
<p>An individual's strength is ultimately limited; using an individual's strength within a group will produce a great effect. Wei Dapeng, even though he is a hero, inevitably has to rely on the strength of the masses to survive and to breathe a sigh of relief for the country and the nation. This is an impression from our rehearsal of Long Live the Nation.</p>
<p>Young people are really lovely. Their blood is so hot, their hearts are so frank, and their national concepts and national consciousness are so strong. Since I joined the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe, I have seen all the comrades staying up all night, sometimes not even eating their meals, desperately preparing for this performance, which makes me feel ashamed. Our bloodshed once or twice on the front line is absolutely incomparable to their contribution of sweating everywhere at all times. Although I do not have their theatrical talent, I also have to wave the flag and cheer, and serve as a foot soldier.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Several Great Famous Plays Performed by the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>For ten months, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe has been travelling through the northern and southern battlefields, moving millions of soldiers and civilians. Now, they are going abroad to promote their cause in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation, out of admiration for the troupe's national defense art and fundraising to help refugees and soldiers, has specially invited them to hold a large-scale charity performance, which will start tonight (the 25th) at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive nights.</p>
<p>The three plays staged by the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe this time include two five-act plays and four one-act plays. The two five-act plays are "Long Live the Nation" and "Spring in Taierzhuang." The four one-act plays are "Thief," "Seeking Life from Death," "Ghosts Weeping in the Night," and "Escaping to Hong Kong." Because these four plays are a series of anti-Japanese stories, they have also been combined into a single play title, "Defend the Motherland."</p>
<p>"Long Live the Nation" is based on the self-defense struggle of the people in Northeast China. The atrocities of the Japanese in Northeast China aroused widespread indignation, so an uprising was held on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, annihilating the tyrannical rebels overnight and avenging the pain of national and familial destruction. This is a five-act play with many complex plots interspersed in the middle: the daughter of a traitor, inciting the puppet army to revolt; peasant leaders deliberating late at night and swearing an oath of alliance with blood. This is a story with very profound significance that educates us on practical struggle experience.</p>
<p>"Spring in Taierzhuang" is a true record of the bloody battle in southern Shandong, completely based on history. The true historical value of this battle is already well known, so there is no need to explain it further. What we hope for is how we should learn from this great spirit and continue the war of resistance. This fully demonstrates the close cooperation between the army and the people, and a noble spirit of heroism in defending the country, which deeply moves us.</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, there have been too many exciting stories, and "Defend the Motherland" is a refined compilation of these stories. "Thief" is a satirical drama; "Seeking Life from Death" tells the story of a fair and honest gentleman who killed his own beloved son in order to protect the secrets of the guerrillas, but an insidious secret service was eventually annihilated by his wisdom. "Ghosts Weeping in the Night" depicts the tragic cruelty of the Japanese bombing, which blurs the line between humans and ghosts among the people. "Escaping to Hong Kong" tells the story of a father and daughter who fled from Northeast China, but they took the wrong path, and they almost forgot who was whipping and tormenting their lives. Fortunately, they later received guidance, ×××××××××××, which led them back to the path of light. These four one-act plays, although they do not have a consistent plot, have a common feature, which is the sparks of blood and flesh that erupt in the war of resistance!</p>
<h3>Learn from "Chinese Salvation"!</h3>
<p>— Lang Pan</p>
<p>The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe was born in the torrent of the war of resistance, traveling to the front lines, the rear areas, and overseas, serving the protracted war of resistance. It is not only a cultural vanguard in the Chinese national liberation movement, but also an educator and organizer of soldiers and civilians in the people's revolutionary struggle. At the same time, it also plays an exemplary leading role in all salvation drama troupes and cultural groups across the country. This is a publicly recognized fact in the cultural sector.</p>
<p>It has been almost two months since the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe came to Hong Kong from the mainland. They have left a fairly deep impression on people from all walks of life residing in Hong Kong. They should naturally leave an even deeper impression on the cultural and theatrical circles in Hong Kong and many groups engaged in salvation work. Now, "Chinese Salvation" is holding a large-scale charity performance starting on the 25th to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation to help wounded soldiers and refugees. After the charity performance, they will go to Nanyang and even embark on a more distant journey. In addition to helping this great performance with respect and enthusiasm, silently wishing it success, and maintaining contact with it in future endeavors, we in Hong Kong's cultural and theatrical circles and all patriotic groups should personally feel that the organizational life and working methods of "Chinese Salvation," and the experience and lessons of Chinese Salvation over the past twenty-odd months, deserve our serious study. The following points, at least, should be particularly important:</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of organization, "Chinese Salvation" is a group filled with the spirit of democracy, with the general assembly as the highest authority, held once a week; the executive committee is the executive body, also held once a week. In this way, a group can be like a harmonious family or even like a body. Although it is more difficult for groups with more members to achieve this, if every member of this group seriously regards the group to which they belong as their own family and body, and strives to correct the errors of their superiors and members, and seeks to realize the spirit of democracy, then this group will definitely be able to develop healthily!</p>
<p>Secondly, "Chinese Salvation" is also a model group that can best use the principle of division of labor and cooperation and truly practice talentism. From the head of the group, Jinshan, the deputy head Wang Ying, the director of the drama department Liu Danqing, the director of propaganda Wu He, to Lin Shu, Fan Zheng, and other members, all are talented people, some drafting and writing articles, some making scenery and props, and some producing films. Although there are differences in organization and name, they can generally eliminate class concepts and realize the principle of "everyone has something to do." At present, there are still a few who do not have very good organization and work, but in fact, the upper and lower levels distrust each other, and they are fragmented. This not only makes the whole group become a formality, but also provides opportunities for a few ambitious people and gangsters to manipulate and exploit it. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all groups can learn from "Chinese Salvation," eliminate all party and factional prejudices, truly respect talents, practice division of labor and cooperation, and only seek to develop the group, without paying too much attention to the small gains and losses and honor and disgrace of the individual.</p>
<p>Thirdly, "Chinese Salvation" is also a group that can fully express the spirit of "unity, liveliness, tension, and seriousness." They have a three-chapter agreement, namely (1) only collective action, no individual action, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows; (2) all internal and external affairs are absolutely open; (3) refusing all public and private banquets unrelated to work, and there are also four "maxims," namely "work tension, life seriousness, economy clear, attitude pure." In addition, in fact, the members of the group can truly help each other in the same boat, helping each other and yielding to each other. Daily life is even closer than brothers and sisters. All of these are worthy of serious study by all salvation groups.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the daily life of each member of "Chinese Salvation" is also worthy of special study. They hold a morning meeting every morning from 7:00 to 7:30, with the content including current affairs reports, reading reports, life reviews, and work arrangements, etc. After the morning meeting is the time for reading and holding group discussions. Noon is for office work and rehearsals, and the evening is for free study. "Chinese Salvation" has become strong in this way of carrying out collective learning and collective work. Any group or even individual, if you want to avoid falling behind, corruption, and deterioration, and want to make progress and achieve satisfactory results at all times, you must learn this style of "Chinese Salvation"!</p>
<p>Fifthly, in practical work, whether on the front lines, in the rear areas, or overseas, they strive to obtain the consent and support of local government troops and leaders from all walks of life, and strive to contact local cultural and theatrical circles and general salvation groups and social organizations. Therefore, all street work to work deep into trenches, rural areas, and factories can often achieve "twice the result with half the effort." This kind of work style is often ignored by general salvation groups. They claim to be "progressive," disdain to engage in upward activities, and do not hesitate to form opposition with groups of different parties, and even curse the united front due to small obstacles, resulting in nothing but setbacks. The working method of "Chinese Salvation" is worth learning, which is also the reason for this. However, all of these must also be determined according to the special environment, special conditions, and their own strength in various places. Of course, in many particularly harsh environments and extremely unprepared conditions, they should make necessary struggles according to their own strength, and should not use this as an excuse to carry out slack work.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also recognize clearly that the reason why "Chinese Salvation" can do this and can succeed is that on the one hand, they are good at carrying out self-criticism and humbly accepting all friendly criticisms, accepting the economics and lessons of progressive revolutionary parties and groups; on the other hand, every member has the confidence to win the final victory in the cause of the war of resistance and nation-building, and in the future of the cause of Chinese national liberation; they have a determined determination to serve the cause of the war of resistance, nation-building and cultural undertakings, and to sacrifice for the liberation of the Chinese nation. These two points are also the fundamental reasons for the development of all the above-mentioned "strengths" of Chinese Salvation, and it should be clearly recognized by our cultural and theatrical circles and all salvation groups!</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>This Saturday's Baseball League: South China to Battle You Pi Team. The Two Teams Have Not Yet Been Defeated. Who Will Win This Time?</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Open Baseball League began on the sixth of this month and has held a total of ten games so far. Among the six teams, the China and Min Diano South teams, which we recognize as having the best talent and strongest strength, have each lost once. The only teams that have remained undefeated so far are You Pi and South China.</p>
<p>Strong teams are inherently invincible, and weak teams can still achieve something. Observing the results of the China and Min teams, we can infer that the future game situation will undergo more changes. The strengths of the six teams are about the same. The previous winner cannot guarantee that they will not be defeated in the future, and the previous loser may not win in the future. Therefore, no matter which team meets, the competition will be fierce, and the outcome is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>It rained continuously last weekend, and baseball games were therefore suspended, which greatly disappointed the fans. The schedule for this weekend's games is as follows. If the weather clears up, there will definitely be a spectacle, because each match features opponents with equal strength. The schedule is announced in advance as follows:</p>
<p>2:30 PM on the 27th</p>
<p>You Pi Team vs. South China Club at Caroline Hill</p>
<p>10:00 AM on the 28th</p>
<p>China Team vs. Western Club at Caroline Hill</p>
<p>11:30 AM on the Same Morning</p>
<p>Min Diano vs. Hong Kong Club at Caroline Hill</p>
<p>The game on the 27th is especially noteworthy, because the two teams have not yet been defeated and have strong strength. This battle will determine who will win. The South China team has two good players, Bao Dui Ping and Feng Jingxiang. Because their trip to South Asia has been extended, they can still participate in the game when the time comes. Since they are competing with You Pi with a complete lineup, they can win. But in any case, the competition in this game will be fierce.</p>
<p>In the first game on the 28th, China will logically win, because China was the champion last year and its strength has not diminished. Although they were defeated by the Min team in their first game, this was due to a chance mistake and not because their skills were inferior. The Western team has lost both of its two games, and its record is very poor. However, the team has several good players and is not easy to beat. If they try their best in the game against China, they may only lose by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>In the second game, the Min team vs. Hong Kong, the fighting power of the two sides is not much different. There will be a fierce battle. However, the Min team is more balanced and has a higher chance of winning. The records of each team are as follows: (Ballpark Tycoon)</p>
<p>(Team Name) Games Won Lost (Record)</p>
<p>You Pi Team 2 2 0 1.000</p>
<p>South China Team 1 1 0 1.000</p>
<p>China Team 2 1 1 0.500</p>
<p>Min Diano 2 1 1 0.500</p>
<p>Hong Kong Club 1 0 1 0.000</p>
<p>Western Club 2 0 2 0.000</p>
<h3>Shan Zha Shi Is the Son of a General; An Bang Is the Second-Best Player in the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Philippine Table Cup representatives Shan Zha Shi and An Bang have already passed through Hong Kong to the United States a few days ago. According to the Philippine Tennis Association, this is the third time to attend the Table Cup, and also the first time in the last eleven years. This time to participate in the North American zone, they will face the winners of Australia and Mexico in the first week. Shan is a college student, twenty years old, five feet four inches tall, and has been the Philippine champion for two years. He recently won the Philippine and Manila singles titles. He participated in the Saigon International Tennis Tournament last year and reached the semi-finals. He is extraordinarily calm when playing, and both his forehand and backhand are sure. He is truly a rare talent. His whole family is good at tennis, and the technique is passed down from generation to generation. In 1929, his father represented the Philippines at the Far Eastern Games, competing against China and Japan. Therefore, Shan can be called the son of a general. An is still studying in middle school, only eighteen years old, five feet two inches tall, and is the second-best player in the Philippines. Yugoslav Table Cup player Ake Jiemuke was poisoned by him in Manila last November. His ball is slow, high, and soft, reaching the baseline on both sides. It has the typical "cowhide candy" style, and it is difficult to win against him. His father is also a famous tennis player, who won the Philippine championship. He was selected as the Philippine tennis representative at the 1930 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo.</p>

<h3>Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament: Association to Pre-Sell Honorary Admission Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament, decided by the Association, will begin on the evening of the 29th of this month. Initially, the Association wanted to adopt an elimination system, but since there were only six participating teams, to increase their competitive interest, it was changed to a single round-robin system. However, the seed method will still be used. The final match (June 10th) is scheduled to be between Zhi Xing and Zhonghua, as these two teams have the best talent and strongest strength, so it will be held last. In addition, the Association, for this charity event, to raise more funds, has printed admission tickets in three denominations: one dollar, fifty cents, and twenty cents. The one-dollar tickets are honorary tickets and will be distributed for pre-sale. It is expected that the ticket revenue will be considerable.</p>

If it is too early, the roll will not be completed, and if it is too late, the feet cannot be raised high.</p>
<p>(63) Backward Roll Headstand and Handstand - After straightening the abdomen and pushing off the mat according to the above method, as soon as the head leaves the mat, immediately raise the head to touch the mat, and use it with both hands as a fulcrum for a handstand. Note that the push off the mat should not use too much force, causing the head to lift too high off the mat.</p>
<p>(64) Supine Feet-Up - From the supine position, first raise the feet over the head, then put the feet down. When the feet pass in front of the head, quickly straighten the legs and stand up.</p>
<p>(65) Forward Roll Backward Roll - Any forward roll, using the method of standing up with crossed feet, after standing up, add a backward turning movement, and you can roll backward. At the same time, any backward roll, using the method of standing up with crossed feet, can also perform a forward roll after turning backward.</p>
<p>Note - The above actions can be performed consecutively in combinations. For example, after a head and hand somersault, you can add a forward roll, or after a headstand and handstand, you can continue to do a head and hand somersault, etc., which can be changed temporarily. In short, as long as two or more actions have successive speed, they can be performed consecutively. Only the learner can comprehend, so I will not list them one by one.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Eloquence</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>Since ancient times, China has had persuaders who specialize in using eloquence to gain high positions. This shows that eloquence is very effective. Besides being useful for becoming an official, eloquence also has the following benefits:</p>
<p>Avoiding being wronged. Some people can go into battle amidst thousands of troops but are unable to utter a word when facing someone, suffering all kinds of injustice. People with eloquence are different. No matter how many people argue with them, they can handle it with ease and always be victorious. Zhuge Liang's verbal battle with the Confucian scholars is a good example.</p>
<p>Resolving people's crises. "A word is worth nine tripods" and "A promise is worth a thousand gold" are sayings that demonstrate the power of words. Even if words are lacking, cleverness can still help resolve crises. Xie Daoyun's rescue of "Young Master" is a good example.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the use of eloquence is even more widespread. The reason is that every citizen should be concerned about national affairs and public service, requiring speeches and discussions everywhere. The "Speech" subject in Confucius' school has now become a required subject in all schools. Organizations such as "Speech Meetings" and "Debate Clubs" are designed to train eloquence. Now, in this troubled time for the nation, it is especially important to use eloquence to promote resistance against Japan and national salvation.</p>
<p>However, where there is advantage, there is disadvantage, which has always been the rule from ancient times. The disadvantages of eloquence seem to outweigh the advantages, which cannot be hidden:</p>
<p>Lying is the bad effect of eloquence. Lying requires eloquence, otherwise listeners will not believe it. Eloquent lies can indeed be told with great flair and persuasiveness, bringing the dead back to life. As for deceiving and killing a few people without facing consequences, that is commonplace. The so-called "fire bulls" can also be attributed to lying because their boastful words are unfounded and absurd, originating from the same source as lies.</p>
<p>Flattery is another negative effect of eloquence. Even if someone has the heart to flatter, but lacks the eloquence to do so, their flattery will definitely fall flat. Like a certain official in the late Qing Dynasty who praised a high official by saying, "I have long admired your cunning and treachery, which are feared by the court and the public." Those who are good at flattery will say to the person, "I know you don't like flattery," which will please the person and make them think they have found a confidant.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Confucius established a "Speech Specialization" in his "Apricot Altar University," he hated those who were good at speaking, calling them "sycophants." He bluntly rebuked: "Using eloquent words to overwhelm people breeds resentment. What is the use of flattery!" When he executed Shao Zhengmao in a fit of anger, one of Shao Zhengmao's crimes was "false and sophistical speech."</p>
<p>In addition, Zhu Yuanzhang's handling of Xu Xuan was also a great pleasure. It is said that Xu Xuan represented the Southern Tang dynasty to negotiate tribute arrangements. Because of his eloquence, for a time no one could be found to deal with him. Later, Emperor Taizu of Song personally selected an official who did not speak much, a "Attendant in Ordinary," which led to the following result: "Initially, Xuan's words were like clouds, and the onlookers were shocked. That person could not answer but only said 'yes, yes.' Xuan was puzzled and kept talking to him. After several days, there was no response, and Xuan became tired and bored!"</p>
<p>The "Eloquence" subject also includes scolding. I don't know if this is appropriate or inappropriate because as soon as one mentions scolding, everyone feels disgusted, thinking that it is at least an impolite expression, an act of insulting others and degrading oneself. Thus, when a village woman scolded a drunken man, she was considered by outsiders to have committed a vice. However, when we see Zhuge Liang scold Wang Lang to death, we feel a sense of pleasure. Jiao Da scolding the Rong and Ning mansions, saying that only the stone lions were clean, we cannot help but raise a cup to celebrate. How can we not clap our hands and shout: "Well scolded! Well scolded!"</p>
<p>Originally, scolding is never born out of indifference or emptiness. Real scolding is definitely not like a superior scolding a clerk or a boss scolding an employee, which is merely venting anger and showing off power. It is always because one's heart cannot bear it, so one erupts uncontrollably. Such scolding is often a wonderful article of eloquence. In ancient times, there were loyal ministers who knocked out their teeth and cut off their tongues, cursing the enemy to death with blood. There was also an old prostitute who scolded the enemy naked to relieve the siege of the city. There are many such examples.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if our eloquence cannot be used for good purposes, such as avoiding being wronged and resolving people's crises, nor should it be misused for bad purposes, such as lying and flattery. I think we should use it for purposes that are neither good nor bad, picking those who deserve to be scolded in this era and scolding them thoroughly until they have nowhere to go in heaven or on earth!</p>
<h3>Soliloquy Hanging Upside Down</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>I opened this gravel factory, but I didn't steal from you. Why do you always look at me with disdain and refuse to let me go? Heaven didn't let me starve to death, leaving me with a little bit of work. It wasn't bombed or burned down. I came back like a dog, covered in mud, stealthily setting up this broken equipment, taking on a little business and stealing a bite to eat. Do you think I've become rich? At this time, to get rich, you have to be a "Chief" or a "Director," or simply lose your conscience like you, extorting everywhere, relying on special powers, cheating your own compatriots. For people like me, not starving to death is already good enough! Who knew that not starving to death would mean being executed by you? You beat me like this! Who can I tell my grievances to? Sigh!</p>
<p>The iron I bought was fair and square, with a seller and an invoice. You thought there was an opportunity to exploit, so you grabbed me with a big fuss, tied me up so tightly that it wasn't enough, and even used handcuffs! Am I a robber? Only robbers accuse innocent people of being robbers. How could I escape your hands? Such power is not necessary. What Industry Headquarters? Ha, you randomly draw, drawing all over the floor. What crime did I commit? After beating me unconscious, you pushed me into the small room next door, dark and damp, filled with the smell of mold and stench. Thank you for looking down on me and not letting me starve to death. I really can't eat those two bowls of gruel every day. I was locked up for five days. On the sixth day, you dragged me out again, released me, punched me hard on the back, and said, "Be smarter, friend, go." Am I a robber? Why did you release me again? I asked when I got back, oh, you took a hundred yuan! You are kidnappers, you are robbers, jackals! You use special powers to bully your own compatriots! You want money, but you don't need to be so fierce, beating people like this. I never stole anything from anyone, I never killed your father! This injury, how long will it take to heal? Pain, who can I tell?</p>
<p>Who can I tell? I see people and feel fear! Friends? They are all afraid, not daring to say a word! They are all afraid! You said, "Be smarter, if you resist again, we'll send you to the military police!" Ah, who can I tell? You have reminded me.</p>
<p>Can I still live here? You pass in front of my door in a grand manner, looking at me with red eyes. I'm trembling all over. I'll die of anger even if I don't starve to death! I can't go on living. I have to leave, go to...</p>
<p>Ah! Pain...</p>
<h3>Selling Beans (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Ming Ji</p>
<p>——The Old Woman's Story——</p>
<p>"The villagers can recognize the roof tiles, so they must be familiar with each other," someone answered for her.</p>
<p>"Indeed," she replied quickly upon being spoken to, "It's rare to see someone from our village. How many 'people' are left behind?"</p>
<p>"Not many, probably. I don't really pay attention." A reply that was indifferent and unconcerned.</p>
<p>She looked at the doorway for a long time, finally noticing one person. This person was about forty years old, with a dark, reddish face, wearing short clothes, looking like a farmer. He had come out several times, each time empty-handed, but when he went back in, he had something in his hand, showing he was a messenger of some kind. Just as she was considering going down, this person walked into the building and came upstairs. She was delighted and began to prepare herself.</p>
<p>As soon as the man came upstairs, he went straight to a seat near the doorway, without hesitation. The waiter, seeing him seated, immediately brought tea without him even asking.</p>
<p>"Want some spiced beans?" The old woman walked to his table, seemingly very casually.</p>
<p>"No," he said, taking a sip of tea.</p>
<p>"Then how about some yellow sand beans?" She pointed to the basket.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll have some yellow sand beans." He acknowledged the basket.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the old woman grabbed two handfuls and placed them in front of him, smiling as she looked at his face and said,</p>
<p>"I think I recognize you. Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"I think I recognize you too," he replied obligingly. Then he added, "I live in Li Family Bridge."</p>
<p>"Ah, Li Family Bridge. My maiden home is in Li Family Bridge," the old woman said with excitement. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Li Jingen."</p>
<p>"Haha, that's right! You were still very young when I saw you," she said, displaying the emotion of someone meeting an old acquaintance. "Have you been working outside all this time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've been working as a messenger in this customs office."</p>
<p>Then she asked him many questions about the customs office, and he asked her about her experience selling beans in this town. They became more and more intimate as they talked, just like relatives. The only difference was that he was standing, and she was standing, indicating that one was drinking tea and the other was doing business.</p>
<p>"You must be doing very well now?" she asked quietly, changing the subject slightly.</p>
<p>"Well, that's hard to say..." His tone also lowered.</p>
<p>"Jingen!" After they had been talking for a long time, someone downstairs called out to him. He stood up, preparing to leave, answering, "Coming, coming!" and reaching into his pocket for money.</p>
<p>"It's alright, pay tomorrow. I'll be here for a few more days," the old woman quickly stopped him.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll pay tomorrow." Jingen went downstairs.</p>
<p>The next day, he indeed ate her beans again and talked with her for a while. When he went downstairs, she still didn't take his money, saying, "Pay tomorrow."</p>
<p>However, when he came to the teahouse the next day, he could no longer find her shadow. He thought that maybe she would come again tomorrow, so he didn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>But she never came back to this teahouse, because she had already returned to her village.</p>
<p>As soon as we saw her return, everyone welcomed her.</p>
<p>"Good news is back! Everyone, listen up!" Wang Mingyuan shouted first.</p>
<p>"There's no good news," the old woman said, placing her cloth bag on the table. "There are some beans left over here; you can eat them."</p>
<p>"What? Where did these beans come from?" Everyone saw the beans dumped on the table.</p>
<p>"Leftovers from selling."</p>
<p>"You went to sell beans? Then what's the news?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot," she said, feigning surprise. "I only knew about selling beans, but I forgot the important matter."</p>
<p>"Tell us, tell us," everyone knew she was joking.</p>
<p>"I really forgot. You guys sort these beans and count them, and maybe I'll remember." Everyone didn't understand what she meant. But they believed she had a reason, so they did as she said, sorting them one by one.</p>
<p>"How many yellow sand beans are there?" she asked. "The fewest, only three."</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you: there are at least three small cannons."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Everyone then understood and let out a collective breath.</p>
<p>"How about salt-soaked beans?"</p>
<p>"Six."</p>
<p>"That means heavy machine guns."</p>
<p>After that, there were fourteen spiced beans, meaning light machine guns; one hundred and eighteen sprouted beans, meaning rifles.</p>
<p>"And what about the two hundred and eighty-two crispy beans?" Wang Mingyuan asked impatiently at the end.</p>
<p>"Does that even need to be said?" the old woman smiled. "Besides guns and cannons, what else do we need to know?"</p>
<p>"Damn it," Wang Mingyuan also laughed. "I was so confused."</p>
<p>The old woman then separated and marked the different kinds of beans on the table, pointing to each pile and saying,</p>
<p>"These are stationed at the bathhouse in Liqiaokou Wulongwei; these are stationed at the City Public Cocoon Exchange; these are..."</p>
<p>She spoke and pointed clearly, leaving a deep impression in everyone's minds, as if they had personally been to Qingzhen.</p>
<p>"Now you really should eat these beans," she said after she finished speaking.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll eat a machine gun!"</p>
<p>"I'll eat..."</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of laughter and joy, all the beans on the table were eaten, but the things these beans represented had already been recorded by someone else, and the beans were indeed useless.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Shanghai newspapers had detailed reports of Qingzhen being briefly captured. There were also mentions of Wang Mingyuan's name, but there was no mention of the old woman. Who would believe that the old woman selling beans was related to this matter? Even Li Jingen is still wondering why she hasn't come to collect the bean money. (The End)</p>
<h3>Rejection and Exploration</h3>
<p>— By Qian Changshou</p>
<p>I scattered all the memories, but they are like a swarm of detestable flies, flying back at once, buzzing constantly in my ears.</p>
<p>Gently pushing open the door of my heart, inside, lies my old memories.</p>
<p>A silent heart is like a white sailboat sailing on the current of memory. It takes me to distant places:</p>
<p>Past events that once made me shed tears can no longer provoke my sadness; old stories that once made me happy can no longer make me laugh.</p>
<p>Having rejected everything in the past, my heart begins to feel empty again.</p>
<p>Everything from the past should be rejected. I will take my heart to a distant place where no footprints have gone, to explore something that can fill the emptiness in my heart.</p>
<h3>Seeking</h3>
<p>— By Li Chen</p>
<p>Fragrant flowers grow beside thorns. Luxuriant weeds grow around beautiful flower clusters, often bringing a comforting smile to a weary traveler's face. Yes, even if this turbulent world is a desert, it is a source of water. And in this universe, filled with wind and thunder, we can still see the colors of the blue sky because of it.</p>
<p>In solitude, flowers seem to be the spiritual refuge for restless lives. Who wouldn't regard them as comfort for wounded souls?</p>
<p>However, this world seems so narrow that it cannot accommodate any fragrant flower.</p>
<p>Thus, when the vast journey looms before us, each person resembles a sail that has lost its anchor, drifting aimlessly. Where will the wind take us next? No one can know.</p>
<p>Seeking a flower, a solace for wounds, has sacrificed countless lives, to liberate the fragrant grass pressed in the crevices of rocks: to guide a lost lamb: to beautify this world, to warm this universe, who would begrudge a handful of sweat, a drop of blood, or even their own life?</p>
<p>Crossing forests, traversing deserts, countless people courageously embark on this journey, bearing the wind and frost, carrying hardships on their shoulders, and walking half or most of the way with weary hearts and dusty faces. Unfortunately, some encounter lions and tigers on mountain paths, engaging in fierce battles, resulting in mutual destruction. Others, due to accidental mistakes, swallow flowers with deadly outer skins.</p>
<p>I am moved by these crowds of people who "died for their ideals." They cleared obstacles with their lives, leaving behind a path to the future. They give people the revelation of "struggle"; they give people the warning of "poisoning." What could be more precious than the "bloody experience" left by our predecessors?</p>
<p>If you cherish a potted plant by the window, if you yearn for a few flowers in a greenhouse, then you should look towards the distance: the free paradise filled with colorful flowers is beckoning to you. Bravely go and seek it! The flesh and blood of our predecessors have already paved the way for you!</p>
