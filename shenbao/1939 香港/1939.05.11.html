<p>『手執劍，一手拿經』，是古今中外侵略者一貫的政策，是所謂『英雄的軍人』慣唱的雙簧好調。這幾天，在歐洲的政治舞台上復又發現這種現象，並且比過去任何一幕都來得起勁。一方面醞釀已久的德意軍事同盟决定於下月初簽字，從此侵略者間的政治合作來得更加鞏固，另一方面則羅馬散佈出教皇提英法德意波五國會議的消息。更其可怪的，一方面德國反波宣傳依然進行，同時且在普魯士邊境建築機關槍網，另一方面，意大利則假惺惺地向波蘭提出調停之議。</p>
<p>我們對於教皇的提議雖未敢遽作受到慕索里尼的嗾使而散佈的烟幕彈之猜度，但是意大利調停德波糾紛的用意則確實包藏禍心，希特勒聲援過慕索里尼，慕索里尼也自要以不流血陰謀　　希特勒。德國對於但澤及波蘭走廊，已勢在必取。德國不但在其國內加緊反波的宣傳，在兩國邊境上集中重兵，並且在但澤及波蘭佈置好國社黨暴動之網。倫敦『每日電訊報』預測得好：『但澤國社黨將向希特勒請求歸併德國，此時波蘭為保護其利益計，將卽行出兵但澤，希特勒即可利用這個藉口，而指波蘭為侵略者』。這個時候一切的調停都要歸於無效。但澤的國社黨已經全付武裝了，德國重兵也已壓到但澤邊境，希特勒的目的地，慕索里尼安有不知？</p>
<p>自從德意軍事同盟的事實，由德意兩國正式宣佈後，歐洲政治舞台全部為之一震，問題的焦點已不獨限於東歐，同時並且牽連到地中海。這於意大利是一個直接而逼切的問題，慕索里尼為緩和英法的注意計，無寧暫來一套軟調。這種雙簧的演秦，在口唱着和平手則滿染着血腥的侵畧者，原是無可驚奇的。最爲——不可思議的，却是英國竟也準備與其他「但澤條約」的簽字國家進行調解德波的糾紛，張伯倫竟宣稱；『英國對於但澤問題，歡迎友誼的調解辦法』。前此在德國與捷克糾紛演至十分嚴重，而德國輿論攻擊捷克最厲害的時候，英國也曾以「明興協定」調解過德捷的糾紛，但是結果呢，捷克固然亡國了，而英法的力量也完全為世界弱小國家所不敢依恃了。</p>
<p>英國最近處理世界各部分糾紛的辦法，確是每况愈下，表面似乎非常聰明，實際則損害了弱小國家而於自已也無好。即日本也看清這一點，居然在歐洲危機日益深化而項國有點窮於應付的今日，發動對英國遠東態度的試探。昨晚日本駐英大使重光葵設宴欵待外相及其他要人，並向英外相提示過英日外交調整的意向。英國將如何應付這一個重要的動向，是值得注意的事項。</p>
<p>英國今日不但在歐洲碰到嚴重的問題，卽在遠東方面，日本對英的進攻也是一步緊逼一步。日本的偽幣政策不但已施行於華北，且在準備再施於華中。英國的遠東商務將為日本所掠奪。今日英國欲應付這個雙頭夾攻的難局，應有極聰明的辦法始可。這正如路易喬治所言：『德意若出兵，如無蘇聯為援，卽有英法波三國的總和，仍不易兌現對波蘭，羅馬尼亞，及希臘之保證。』今日的局勢比歐戰時還危難，遠東還多一個日本，英法若蘇聯合作，實在難以應付裕如</p>
<p>侵畧者是在唱着雙簧，英法所拿定的主意，不知究竟竟是什麽？</p>
<h3 id="c2">東江青年在戰爭面前　東江青年運動的任務和方針 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 林衡</p>
<p>（一）發揚東江青年的革命精神</p>
<p>大革命時代的東江青年</p>
<p>遠在大革命時代的時候，東江靑蓮已有蓬勃的發展，我們說廣東為中國革命策源地，更應該說東江為廣東革命重要的一个環節，大革命時代東江到處燃起了革命的烽火，在海陸豐，在惠陽，紫金，五華，曾經有過偉大的英勇的革命史　，東江靑年據有着革命的傳統。</p>
<p>在抗戰將要　入第二期，走上更困難更嚴重的階段的今天，也就是客觀形勢迫切地要求我們全國上下加强團結力求進步的今天，我們大家來把東江靑年過去的革命精神發揚光大起來，甩此來因答日×企圖向西南做新的進攻。</p>
<p>東江青運的低潮</p>
<p>跟着大革命時代的结束，東江靑蓮也轉入低潮的階段，由於客觀環境不利於民運的發展，東江靑運也漸漸由低潮轉入　乎結束了靑運的生命。這期間到處不能冉看見偉大的革命的烽火燃燒了，靑年運動是沒有了，自然還有極少數的靑年在　續着做眞理的追求，企圖在革命的火把上加油，希望這革命的火把孑致於永速的息滅！</p>
<p>（二）東江青年在戰鬥中東江青運復活了</p>
<p>如果把在東青運劃爲幾個階段的話，那　大革命時代爲第一階段，革命時代結束至抗戰爆發前為第二階段也就是低　期，抗戰爆發後是第三階段，這階段主要的特點便是果江靑運復活了。</p>
<p>抗戰開始東江靑年又感覺到自己任務的重大，大家一致認為：民衆是抗日的主力軍抗戰勝利與發展民運動是絕對分不開的，靑年運動在民族解放的連動中起着先　啓發，推動和橋楔的作用在民衆運動中靑運，佔民運主要地位和活躍的地位，於是要爭取最後勝利便更加强靑年運動，難道還不明白嗎？我當局對這點也很淸礎，各縣普　發起民民衆抗×後後會的組織，東江靑年首先嚮應了這個號召且在各地籌備建立靑年抗×同志會。但在這個時期中由於長時來，組織上還很个健全，許多組織還沒有經常的工作表現，因此經不起較大的打擊，日×的黑手伸到東江來的時候。有些組織竟形成解體狀態，不過這是很短的時期。</p>
<p>日×在患博燒殺姦掠的×行事實，把他們的假皇道懷容政策粉碎了；日×在惠博表現兵力不足，小部隊不能獨立作戰內部反戰情緒濃厚的弱點，教訓了東江的同胞，使同胞們認職了强盜的眞面目，認識了「要生存便要抗戰」於是東江到處又從新燃起了革命的烽火！東江青運也走上新的階段！</p>
<p>空前的高潮</p>
<p>客觀形勢的要求，東江靑運的發展，已成為歷史的必然產物，首先在惠陽舉起了光榮的旗幟，惠青開始與日×作殊死的鬥爭，博蘿的青年開始作游擊的嘗試，正在這個時候，東江為華南的前軍——抗先，這一支生力軍在東江靑蓮的發展上起了相當的作用，先到東江後便在政府的愛護培養和帮助之下，先後分　到河源，新　，龍門，龍川，紫金，惠博海陸豐等地工作，幫助民衆組織民衆抗×自衛恊會，以展開民衆運動，帮助地方靑年建立靑抗組織，同時也組織了它自已的縣，鄕隊都，訓練了幾百個靑年幹部，相當晋　地播下了抗×的種子。</p>
<p>最愛護祖國的最可愛的華僑，尤其是廣東的華僑更加團結起來了！他們組織了南洋惠僑救鄉會救護隊，到惠博施米，施術，施藥品和棉衣，還組織了東江服務團到各縣工作。</p>
<p>各縣的青抗會業就在這時期中特別是在最近，更鞏固和發展起來了，有些地方更由統一的行動中去建立統一的組繼了，工作中心由城市轉入農村，發展的對象也出知識份子轉向工農份子方面去了，更能够由低級的級織變為高級的組織，由分散變為集中，由局部變為　遍了，這都是東江靑連的優點，也就是空前的高潮的特點，據一般的統計，東江已組織起來的青年已有萬餘人，可以說巳建立了東江靑運的基礎。幾千靑年正在前線與日×鬥爭中，其餘的幾千即在後方加緊動員一切力量來支持抗戰。這些都是東江靑運的成績。</p>
<p>表現的弱點</p>
<p>自然我們還存在着許多的弱，首先便是組織的範　太多了，我們過去還是留在城市在知識份于的周圍打圈子，所以直至現在，在東江的百餘萬靑年中我們僅僅組織了百分之一，而且這小少的組織還很不健全，領導幹部還很缺乏。，多　還是年輕的經騐少。</p>
<p>其次我們的工作還是很表面不能深入，不能實際，工作作風還犯着左的關門主義的毛病，清除不了宗派主義自私主義和政治化的作風，統一戰綫的作風還做得太不夠許多地方還不能得到政府具體切實的領導，這些者是東江青運發展的最大障碍。</p>
<p>經騐和教訓</p>
<p>一，一切組織要先得到公開合法，誠心職意的擁護政府取到政府積極的　導才易發展，自然組織上最好是要通過統一戰綫的形式，組織的方向應該放到廣大沒有耝織起來的靑年方面，用各種各樣適台靑年的要求的組織形式去組織各階段各部門的靑年。</p>
<p>二，只有加强理論的研究，靑運的大量發展才能得到保證，我們過去由於政治把握的不够，對戰爭形勢估計得更不够，不了解統一戰綫的理論和運用方法，更不了解廣東環境的特點和各地的具體環境，因此工作便不能好好的開展</p>
<p>總之，目前東江靑運還存在着許多的弱點，東江靑運還趕不上客觀形勢的要求，經驗告訴我們，我們的組織還不够當固，還經不起戰爭的打華我們要接受世界靑運，中國學運，靑運；臘衆靑運的經驗教　便要來一個統一的組織。</p>
<p>（三　建立東江青年的統一戰綫　建立統一戰綫的重要性和可能性</p>
<p>只要不是雄辯家而據有政治常訓的人，誰也不會否認，目前在中國建立各種統一戰綫的組織的重要性和可能性，因為統一戰綫組強在工作上取得了一致的配合减少工作和時間的浪費，同時由於日×漢奸，托派，敵探的到處被壤團結，耕一戰綫的組織可以减少團體間的磨擦，减少×人挑撥離間的機會，又可以避免同志流動時失掉聯絡。更可以增加共同研究靑運經驗教訓的機會以謀實運的發展。</p>
<p>事實已經證明了而且在證明着，由於抗戰的持久性，建國的長期性，决定了全國一致團結的長期性和必然性，决定了建立靑運統一戰綫的可能性，過去中國事聯的建立，現在各地建立靑運統一線戰都是最好的例子，而目加上我當局近來對靑運的重親愛護，關心培養的結果在廣東巳有八個團體聯合建立的統一戰綫組織——廣東靑年抗日先鋒隊，西　和中區各　都已建立起靑年的統一戰綫由各縣長和黨部書記長直接領導，東江的龍川縣抗先在縣長和書記長責任隊長的直接領導之下已有很快的發展，河源縣在黨部切實領導之下的五個救亡團體的統一戰綫以已聯合座談會的形式出現，這些都是建立東　靑年統一戰綫的重要性和可能性的模範例子。</p>
<p>怎樣建立東江青年的統一戰綫？</p>
<p>一，鞏固現有的一切抗戰的靑年團體。在固有的組織基礎上組織無組織的靑年，廣大地吸收靑年參加組織：組強各種各樣的外爲團證使之環繞在該組織的周圍。加强充實和改善現有組織使成為四年羣衆的學校，俱樂部和團結靑年的有力團體，取得政府積極的領導。</p>
<p>二，發場各團體之間互助讓的精神。把靑運興羣衆運動聯系起來，尤其是要與歸運，兒童運動聯系起來用工作發展組織，培養最有威信有社會地位的中心團體帮助其克服官僚主義，自流主義。關門主義的，——切不良的作風，使成為統一組織的模範用以推動其他的團體。</p>
<p>三，通過統一的行動來建立統一的組織，當然統一行動是由局部雄到擴大，首先在一縣裏還沒有統一組強的便應當馬上利用一切的機會來一次統一的行助，在統一的行運中建立統一的組織，在已建立起統一組織的各附近縣之間也應該同樣來建立統一戰綫，由此擴大到全東江，故整個東江靑年統一戰綫的建立是長期性的。我們不能因為它是長期性的而讀它自流地發展而應該是從今天起，我們便應汪意到這個問題。</p>
<p>爲建立東江青年統一戰綫的模範而奮鬥</p>
<p>我們熟知建立東江靑年統一戰綫不但是可能而且必要，因此從今天起我們每一個靑年工作者，便要爲建立東江靑年統一戰綫的模範而奮鬥，我們據有了成為統一戰綫的模範的條件，廣東靑運有許多特點，其中的一個便是，一開始卽用統一戰綫的姿態出現（抗先）一開始卽得到當局的領導和培養，於是在中國靑運中已起了統一戰綫的模範作用，我們東江靑年有偉大的革命傳統，各縣縣長和黨部書記長都愛護靑運，並且有好些縣如河源，龍川，和平，博羅……等縣已經積極的在領導青年運動，加以目前東江靑運已有了初步的基礎，我們已經組織起來的靑年不會比嶺東，北江，西江，南路各區少許多，但我們發展的速率却比好多地方要快，因此只要我們每一個靑年工作同志都願惟最大的努力為爭取東江靑年統一戰綫的模範而奮鬥，那麼很有可能得到光榮勝利的前途。</p>
<p>（四）我們當前的任務和方針</p>
<p>我們當前的總的任務便是：發揚廣東的革命精神，特別是東江靑年的革命傳統，誠心誠意的擁護政府帮助政府和軍隊，取得政附　切的領導下動員，組歲了武裝廣大的靑年積極參戰，凖備在瀹陷區×後方發展轉擊戰爭，來保衛自已的家鄉，保衛東江，保衛華南。</p>
<p>第一個任務和方針是堅持建立東江靑年統一戰縫，鞏固政府與靑年的聯系，在不反這統一戰綫的原則不防碍統一戰綫發展的原則下，用各種各樣的形式來，組織捫大無組織的靑年，通過統一運動建立統一組織，現在的問題不是在能否組織靑年的問題而是能否組織廣大靑年問題，是能否組織全體靑年的問題』（</p>
<p>第二個任務和方針是動員和組織靑年參加戰爭，發起靑年運動，靑年位置在前綫，在淪陷區，在×人後方發動和參加　擊戰爭，加緊學習軍事和武器的使用，政治工作者應當軍事化，一切為着軍事的勝利，動員靑年到軍隊去，參加各種隨軍服務團，各種軍事政治訓練班，參加兵役宣傳，普遍地廣大發起優待抗戰軍人家屬運動，大量建立半軍事化半武裝靑年團體的組織。</p>
<p>第三個任務和方針是，澈底的改變過去的『左』的，政治化的關門主綫的作風，宗派主義的成見，官僚主義的（導，自由主義的毛病，這些作風都是新發展的重大障害，我們除非把作屬轉變不足以應付客雞觀的緊迫形勢，我們應該要求每一個青年同志改變過去的作風，來一個新的作風，新作風的針對着目前抗戰緊迫的形勢要求全民族加强團論而來，所以應該是，統一戰線化的互助互體的顧全大局的作風；是民主化的非包　的，靑年化的非改治化的；是埋頭苦幹的實際主義作風，而且還要特別加强文化娛樂　合靑年的特性和要求，</p>
<p>第四個任務和方針是發展學生運動，自抗戰爆發發後學生運動已轉　為靑年運動，廣州失守後，廣東的學生運動出轉變爲青年動動了。救亡運動不再留在學生范圍打圈子，而是由學運轉到各階屋的靑年運動，這是進步的表現，但是我們却不能因此而忽視了學生運動在靑運中佔着重要的位置，過去幾個月我們未免忽略了，現在各　中小學校都多數復躁了，博羅的戰時中畢也俠要開課，所以我們從今天起便要注意到學生運動，當然今後的學生運動與過去的學運不同，我們要要求各校當局切實實行戰時教育，執行全國教育會議的决議，增加抗戰理論教材，一面讓書一面工作，讀書不忘救國，建立全體性的學生組織。用各種各樣的組織形式去團給全校的同彖，通通學運去訓練大批的抗戰幹部，通過學運去發展婦女運勸，兒童運助，通過擊遲去展開鄕村戰時文化運動。發起掃除文盲運勵，今後學運應該成為勸員一切人力物力財力參戰的　　，今後學運應該是師生打成一片的學運，不但注意一校而且要注意到各校注意到與中聯的聯系，世聯的聯系，不但注意國內的抗敵宣傳而且要注意到同世界的宣傳。</p>
<p>第五個任務和方針是改善靑年生活，大家都會承認沒有人能够說着腹皮來支持抗戰，目前中國靑年生活太苦了，在東江更加上了日×的政治進攻收買土　包辦走私，包烟包賭，徵牧捐稅，打刦行族同，擾亂鄕村，使靑年生活更加受苦，所以改青靑年生活與動員靑年參戰是不可分離的，改善靑年生活的目的是為着抗戰動員。自然改善靑年生活不能高於一切，必須服從抗戰。　會改善生活與抗戰衝突時應當顧全抗戰，在鄕村我們可以通過統一戰統去厲行減租减息以改善靑年生活，要求政府救濟失學失業靑年粗織和訓練之，禁止打罵靑工和學徒，向股府要求參政，減輕參政法定年齡。</p>
<p>我們當前的任務和方針是說過了，不通這只是我們很少數的工作同志提出的意見，希望每一个靑年工作同志尤其是東江的靑年朋友們加以討論，批評指正和補充，好讓我們大家努力來完成其們的任務吧！爲完成我們的任務而門爭！爲建立東江青年統一戰綫的　範而門爭，用遭推動廣東青運的統一戰綫，鄉影全國的青年運動，努力吧！光明已在面前。</p>

<p>（上海通訊）英商麥加利銀行最近在倫敦舉行第八十五次股東大會，由威里斯主席，提出一詳盡之報告，對我國現行之局勢，經濟建設之展望；通貨信用之穏固，均有極中肯之析述，而對我國抗戰之堅苦，尤深表同情，新聲社記者茲譯其原文如次，覽閱損益計算壽，詡君當發覺本年度（當年度）之純利爲三十三萬五千三百零九鎊，較諸上年度四十九萬一千零六十五鎊，退减幾達十五萬方千籌，此雖未見重要，余儘可以指出此卅三萬五千三百　九鐘之數。實包括由填補政府證券任何抵折之準備帳項轉撥數也，余現請解釋招致利潤退減之不利因素，吾人諸營業地其貿易量均見退減，但中日兩國</p>
<p>商業情況不斷趨於惡劣，更對吾人關係紊重諸君中想多數均能嚴密觀察各該地之事態演變，此刻似無庸余之詞費，余謹指出過去十八個月之正常商業為吾所通融資金者大受擾阻，倘此似為過去之更調，或吾人最返的將來，將能回復較正常之情形，此則固所欣幸耳，余所指者，係華北新通貨之實施，極力強迫商人與偽組織銀行交易，並採用新幣（偽幣）此實干涉正常貿易之凶兆，關係吾人在華貿易將來之成功，尤其是在華北方面有不容忽視者，其次過去兩年間，吾人人持有之政府證券，其價格大趨跌落，過去各年間，余曾經宣運此項證券，大都係屬短期，此則又殊未許吾人遽抱樂觀矣，董事同人，有鑒於此，因决定條低各項不可靠帳項及枯帳外，應撥劃政府證券及現行市價，由本年度盈利數撜抵，並由準備帳作必要之移撥，董事部及經理部同人，及余本人，對紅利之减少事，如何不安，無待言說，惟在此等環境下，吾人之保守政策，當得諸君之贊許也，余去年間曾經提出一警示，指明在中日兩國業務，殊難獲利，去年九月間所分派之紅利，由百分之七减為百分之五，因而或不致引記諸君之訝異也，諸君於吾時有</p>
<p>大英銀行</p>
<p>股份之資產負債表中，有一註明，謂巳經簽定一合同，由一九三九年一日起，承受大英銀行，該銀行之總行，設在倫戲·印度·錫蘭·海峽·英馬殖民地，及中國等地，為有分行，其業務範圍，本行分設有分行於英倫與各該地間，或各該地相互間，商業在展擴狀况下，兩銀行大有所經營，但一九三一年以來，經濟情形不利，而照吾人所推斷，於最近的將來，又有改進之望，懂經加人經嚴密考慮多時，進行歸併該行業務於本行，藉以减少營業費用，同時免去不可避免之競爭，此議當於去年十一月間决定，自余去年曾向諸位報告以來，從英國在華之商業及金　觀點，遠東情形大趨惡化，中日兩國間之鬥爭迄未停止，戰綫不斷綿長，而自一年又半　酷的戰事以後，破壞廣泛，經濟脫節，解决之望，仍然渺還，中部各省備受破壤，人烟斷絕，從前繁盛之區，已不復為國際貿易之尾閭，揚子江巳非為貿易之脈樞，漢口及其他口岸之屢產品市塲，亦已封閉，而自廣州淪陷以後，事實上中國沿海岸各地，均已在日人控制中，局時，日人更企圖於華被造成其政治上與經濟上之獨霸權，了如其滿洲所為者，本行雖於東方各地有重大利益，但通常在中國各埠之分行業務，實構成全部業務之大部，此則又無待余之請諸君加以注意者，</p>
<p>國際貿易資金之流通，對東方兩大國家之現行戰爭雖不宜有所偏頗，但在此場合，倘對有許多係本行之友之華人，現行所通着之慘况，而不深表同情者，實又殊缺定人道琎念矣，雖中國現狀呈現無數悲懷亂離之象，但一種進展正在發展之中，使中國及全世界充滿希望，余請一談中國西部諸省新經濟計劃建立之努力從事，及在此未經開發天然蘊藏富厚之區，向該處移民，據估計所得，約千數百萬中國人，其中包含商人及專門人才，現已移居西區邊阡，其始對安挿此輩人士，使得適當之工作問題，似屬不能解决者，但經當局負責人員之熱心努力策劃，故余絕不遍疑，認定中國人隨遇而安與勤苦工作之特性，其其穫足以抵償有史以來最大悲劇之一，所引起之損失而有餘，自本世紀之初葉，中國之友人曾一再向中國當局表示希望將富庶之西部諸省開放。利用與築貿易水道，連眞雲　緬甸，以與各國通商，但卒未果，因受武力盧脅，中購自動尋求　過緬甸暹境之原料出路。建築公路隊綫，已有驅著進展，此項公路，所以聯榮中華民國之重要城市，與緬甸及依拉華地河之通航地點。</p>
<p>上海方面</p>
<p>情形與余一年前所見者，未見有大變更之處，且與一般人士知者無異，該處之外人貿易，於一九三八年中，所受打擊，較中國其他各地尤甚，關於中國貨幣之鞏固，一年之前，余嘗有所論列，因北半天津偽聯合準備銀行之設立，及在華北發行新「偽」貨幣，中國政府遂限制賣英鎊及他國貨幣，已遭破壞，若干月中，外匯雖有指定數額，然上海對倫敦之匯率，低降甚速，由一先令兩辦士二五降至八辦士，自去年六月以至現在，匯率維持原狀，市情僅有和緩性之縮漲，維持中國貨幣之隠定，與英國　易，關係極為重要，三月八日，財相宜佈，關於設立貨幣穏定金額一千萬英鎊，本銀行因得有英國財政部允許保證，補償損失，而參與其事，其設立之目的固在斯，受人歡迎可無疑義，徐問接以外，此金額，與華北方面無關，此一問題，當引起英美法政府向日提出嚴重抗議，如前此所言，因上海外匯率自去年六月，能壽持於較穏定基礎之中，外間恊助，亦僅屬平常及忽斷忽續之性質者，雖局面仍有若干不穏定之象，而吾人之希望此項穏定金額之能牧效，仍屬理由充足，余旣將本行謹有支行各要區貿易受打擊，</p>
<p>主要原因向君等作一簡略之報告，余茲對一事欲作一簡單之提供，此事乃余認為將來國際貿易有相當關係者，此卽英美貿易恊定是也，此恊定余擬直稱之為英帝國美國貿易協定，因其內文規定，不僅係美國與大不列願之貿易故也，此為兩大國，致力於將貨物交易之管理情形改良，使其簡單化，以鼓勵發展買易，謀有關各方面之實際福利、余等之政府賦予出口信用保證局更大之力量，使得對本國之出口貿易，予以廣泛之幾助、政府此項决定，余甚歡迎，苟世界大勢能趨安定，則世界貿易之改進，原料價格提高，使余等甚為關懷之東方諸國之生活水準，亦因之提高，必不　實現也云云，主席報告及一九三八年度賬目，由出席者一致　　，任期已滿之董事及核數員，通過連任，並通通向主席董事司　人員及職員致謝其工作之良好成績，繼開特別別大會，向出席者提出轉　該銀行特許之計劃，亦經一致通過畢，遂飲會。</p>

<p>五日的淸晨、×已緊逼城關了、某師及某師之一部、與×發生悲慘的巷戰、數度衝入的×軍、均被無情的大刀的倒、雖達到了消耗的任務、但×軍有砍是機械化武器的接連衝鋒、致使我無法以濟其窮、終於在午前九點鏡的光景、將×機迭炸瓦礫一片的古老縣城宣告放棄了、</p>

<p>【又訊】大陸報云、駐滬日總領署參贊、四月一日在招待記者席上、答覆詢問、對於在滬限制貿易、籍以支持昨在紅口開業之華興商業所將發行之紙幣、作　約之暗示、蓋渠對於商人有被迫向此銀行或日方卵　下銀行獲取出口許可證之可能性、拒不預發任何言論、此卽含有或將實施限制之意也、昨據經同盟社發出之文告稱、華興商業銀行資本「五千萬元」、依「維新砍府」法律而組成、將發行可自由易外幣之紙幣云云</p>
<p>最後數語、引起各記者紛紛同參贊質問、該參贊答覆最初之問話云、華興商業銀行將按照與中國法幣同價之市價、以本行所發紙幣、無限制出售外匯、其記者問、此極外匯之來源為何、有可表示否、將自海關經出口許可而獲得之乎、如該銀行無限制供給外匯、則必可獲得無限制之數量矣、發言人云、目前無此種限制之意、有詢由此答語推測之、如公衆不以出口單交該銀行辦理、而自動支持之、則日當局將實施與華北現有限制相類之跟制乎、發言人答、以吾人之地位、目前不能討論將來之事、</p>
<p>有詢華興商業銀行能否有倫敦興紐約成立信用借款便利、參贊稱彼拒不答覆此問、有詢提議發行之紙幣、是否由外幣或法幣支持、或其資本僅記錄於賬藩、而有名無實者乎、參贊答將以法幣為資本、而以此發行紙幣、平價接受、某記者述及被推為華興商業銀行　裁之偽『維新政时財長』陳錦瀆所發文告事而詢曰、南京所稱法幣刻遇危機之說、發言人亦以為然否、如法幣跌價、將發生何種情况乎、參贊稱、法幣不健全、乃『一般人均　認之事實』、但渠旋復承認將與法幣平價、接受提議發行之紙幣、</p>
<p>發言人以為第三國銀行之條例、不致妨礙新幣、並答稱、若干外國銀行已同意辦理新幣、有詢能舉此等外國銀行之名否、參員云、名單尚未完畢、目前渠不欲舉其名云、按昨日經同盟社發出之消息稱華與商業銀行頃在新亞酒店舉行成立大會、陳錦濤被舉為該行總裁、前長春之滿洲「中央銀行」理事　尾磯一爲副總裁、該銀行之資本將「十足　完」、計「維新政府」出資二千五百萬元、日　六銀行出其餘數、又謂、該行紙幣將成為佔據區中之法定貨幣、正式付款及銀行商　往來、均將接　之、唯一之例外、爲不得用以付關稅、但此種限制新幣之使用、據陳氏之宣言中稱、乃屬「暫時」性質云、日本參贊在昨日之招待記者席上　稱「新銀行」所發紙幣、有堅强之支持、但顯有若干疑點、蓋參贊亦稱新幣以法幣為支持、而陳氏宣言中　稱法幣前途、「實不可逆料」者也、</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十日電】塔斯社莫斯科十日電。據倫教傳出消息、路透社已廣播報告、大意謂英政府對於蘇聯之提案的答覆、包含如下各基本對案、第一、蘇聯必須劉于其隣近之各國、單獨提出保證、第二、如蘇聯因履行此種保證之結果、而捲入戰爭漩渦、則英國卽將援助蘇聯、根據自蘇聯權威方面所得消息、塔斯社不得不鄭重聲明、路透社此種報告、與事實并不完全相符、蘇聯政府實際上本月八日始接到英政府之反提案、法政府對該提案、亦未提出反對、所提各案、亦未述及蘇聯政府必須對於其鄰近之各國、必須單獨提出保証、其中僅稱、如英法履行其對於波蘭與羅馬尼亞之義務、而引起軍事行動時、蘇聯政府必須立卽予以援助、然英政府之反提案中、亦毫未述及、如蘇聯因對東歐某數國履行其義務、而同樣引起軍事行動時、蘇聯政府本互惠之基礎、亦應獲得英法方面之援助、</p>
<p>【海通社倫敦十日電】此間公佈、英首相張伯倫將於星期三日下午、在下議院宣佈關于莫斯科談判情形、目前雖不能預測該項宣言內容如何、但據消息靈通界稱、星期二晚、蘇聯通訊社發表半宫式宣言雖屬誤會所致、屆時英首相將有詳細解釋、</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦十日電】「新聞紀事報」外交訪員巴萊特今日宣稱、蘇聯關於英建議之公報、頗使此間情緒不寧、巴萊特並謂英政府並未要求蘇聯合作、共同防衛英法之邊境、然蘇方公報所表示者、乃蘇聯堅决之立塲、要求與英法訂立協定、包括歐洲全部、而非僅止於英國前所提出保設之國家、此間認為英國之反建議、僅係一種提案或觀察、進一步談判之門、仍未關閉也、</p>

<p>【美聯社梵蒂崗九日電】教皇建議召開五强會議、各方未兒加以歡迎、因此本日已有放棄之勢、因波蘭不願進入「另一慕尼黑」、法國似已决定不參加對於意國爭端之調停、英國亦不願參加此項談判、因此項談判或將壓迫英國向其同盟國施行壓力也、德意兩國對於召開此會議之邀請表示懷疑、因恐懼在此會議中、渠等勢必寡不敵衆也、</p>

<p>【路透社梵蒂岡九日電】外間盛傳教皇或將召開會議、以解决德波糾紛、聖城方面、頃謂不可盡信、教皇關懷和平、惟仍主張由平常外交途徑着手、因此各駐外國教廷代表在過去數日中、曾與各政府元首及外長接觸、表示教皇之深切願望、蓋教皇認為和平可以互諒、各國間之問題、亦可和平解决也、</p>

<p>【路透社倫教九日電】據悉、教皇現正努力拉攏英、法、德、意、波五國、舉行會議、以冀解决但澤及地中海問題、現正在各國京城接洽中、聞教廷方面對教皇此舉、　助甚力、</p>
<p>【中央社柏林九日電】關于德波之爭、教廷駐德代表奧森尼柯主教、近向德政府呼籲和平後、此間消息靈通人士宣稱、德政府提出答案、緣教皇庇亞士十二世此項發表、具有高尚之道義目標、德方自當以同情態度、予以攷慮云、</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎十日電】教皇在各國京城努力進行活動、籲求獲德、波爭端和平解决之消息發表後、此間各報本日一致加以討論、「人道報」及「人民報」表示此舉對波蘭之土地獨立、頗有抵觸、而「地球報」及「超然報」則認為、目下根本并無此項調解之急切須要、權威方面宣稱、教皇現并未提出具體建議、是以各報并未討論五强會議問題、</p>

<p>目前推進文化運動的需要已隨精神總動員的展開而日益急迫，而文化食糧或精神食糧問題便見得嚴重起來了，這在國內是如此，在各地華僑中間尤為如此。</p>
<p>本港人口雖達百數十萬，而供給文化精神食糧的圖書館則寥寥三數間，其中真正能向大眾開放而給予中下僑胞以實際利益的。當首推華商總會的圖書館了，現在報戲近曾有人提議停辦，這個消息一定使人驚訝的，我們希望不要成為事實，相反的，我們誠懇祈望社會領袖一致努力，予以經濟上或精神上的援助，俾其獲得正常的發展，則不僅本港百萬文化訉芾者受恩不淺，而社會上無形中所獲利益，尤為不可限量！</p>
<p>圖書舘事業的盛裴，多與國家的興替有　。近世文明各國，咸視發展圖書舘事業為最重要的國家事業。而其間有賴於社會熱心人士之贊助的。尤非鮮淺。所以我們除了祈望各界協力襄助華商總會圖書館的畫展以外，並盼能盡心竭力，以建立新的向中下僑胞開放的圖書館。目前記者學會正在籲請各界捐助圖書，希望各界予以熱烈的響應與援助。以經史傳子孫，自古資為美談，今日如能慷慨解囊，購捐圖書傳世，則福世壽民，其功績尤其是不可同日而語的。我們　在此處為數十百萬精神食糧恐慌者竭誠呼籲！</p>

<p>— 廖崇聖</p>
<p>就財力言，歐洲大戰時，德為一債　國，對外投資凡二百五十萬萬馬克，兩故每年可以抵償有形之入超約四十萬萬馬克。自一九一四至一九一八年，其入超共計一百六十萬萬馬克，而直至歐戰將終之際，其國家銀行之存金尚值二十五萬萬馬克之餌，今者，穗爲債務國，其長短期公債共達一百萬萬馬克之鉅，自併奧呑捷後雖多獲數千萬鎊之金準備，惟縱合其自身現存區區六百萬鎊及若干秘密準備及外匯之數，較諸一九二四年之德國，仍有小巫見大巫之歎。</p>
<p>夫昔日穗奧形勢之如此優越，尚且以原料糧食之不足而戰敗於聯軍；今之德國，其糧食原料缺乏如故。而財力史遠遜於當年。是則希特勒之野心雖熾，然亦斷無舉其國運作孤注之一擲者也。</p>

<p>行文至此，國際形勢益趨好轉。使人最感　奮者，跃為高瞻遠矚，當仁不讓之羅斯福總統，於侵略者耀武揚威，呈其最後成脅之頃，一面本其政治家之風度，致電希特勒，莫索里尼，建議和乎；一面運用其憲法上之權力，遺艦東來，作實力之牽制。使獨裁者為之蹇滯躊躇，其造福於人類者洵非淺鮮。然而，居安思危，西歐得此須臾之喘息，對於反侵略陣綫之促成。尤應加倍努力。須知，今日之和平，武力之和平也。奉尼采如神明之希特勒莫索思尼，豈以羅斯福之呼籲而有所動於中乎？實懾於美國實力之龐大，而不得不慎重將事耳。惟在美國一時尚難積極參加前，英，法，蘇三强之軍事合作，實為綏靖歐局不能或缺之要件。月來彼此使節往還固極頻繁，惟合作之佳音，則迄仍未至。是誠令人不勝其關切者。查英，法向有若干之金融工業巨子，因階級意識之驅使，對蘇始終猜忌，復惑於德，意二國於南歐之經濟利益根本衝突之片面理由，迄今仍作離間意國之癡想。深冀張伯倫，達拉第二公，於大夢初覺之餘，義無反顧。以免一誤再誤，併此最後時機而失之，致陷歐洲於萬劫不復之境也。</p>
<p>日本為國際公法×××。自與柏林羅馬軸心聯合後，此唱彼和，狼狽為奸，盡其牽制威脅之能事。是我國之抗日，其國際意義，自始卽爲和平陣線之一圜。無奈彼西歐領袖的民主國家，一時惑於妥協苟安之念，任令我國獨力掙扎，而中侵略者各個擊破之詭計。幸而經我廿餘月之英勇搏鬥。西歐民主陣線，於大夢初覺，重整旗鼓之餘，已漸悟吾國國際責任之重嬰，並進而攷慮將反侵略陣線擴展至遠東之理想階段矣。當此國際形勢，豁然開朗；最後勝利，益形接近之時，謹以萬分誠意切盼當局：（一）於軍事方面，以更大之努力，暴露×人之弱點，證明我國對此反侵略之國際萬任，確能當之無愧。（二）於精神方面，督促全國之文化戰士，對此勝利之關鍵作普遍深刻之宣傳，使我抗戰必勝之信念，益趨堅强。（三）於外交方面。緊握此稍縱卽逝，千載一時之良機，積極展開對民主國之外交活動。民主國家覺悟之日，厥為吾國勝利開始之時，吾人袛須本其百折不撓之精神，貫澈持久抵抗之國策，則民族解放之期，當在目前矣。國人其共勉之！</p>

<h3 id="c27">香港的好青年！ <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>參加集體生活、青年會本屆徵求會友突破紀錄</p>
<p>充實理論修養：生活書店青年節售書亦突破紀錄</p>
<p>靑年人有熱情，有活力。他能够創造一切，亦能够毀減一切。他是歷史上的「功臣」，亦是歷史上的罪人。他可以給人們歌頌，亦可以給人們咒咀，南轅北轍的關鍵，就是决定於他的思想，他的人生觀。</p>
<p>在香港，因為刺激的尖銳，靑年人向兩個極端走去亦來得明顯。他不是使人覺得特別可愛；就是使人覺得十分痛惜！</p>
<p>痛惜的別去多說他，這裏，我們還是來說說可愛的靑年好吧：</p>
<p>首先要說的是本港靑年會這次擴大徵求會友運動的空前收獲。靑年會本是本港一個頗有歷史的進步團體，過去對靑年活動和社會工作都有不少的貢献。該會每年舉行一次徵求會友運動同時進行募捐運動。去年第二十九屆的會員共四千多人。今次第三十届重新登記舊會員外又增加新會員千來人，現在共有會員約五千人，學生佔三分之一，各界人士如銀行，商家，各機關的從業員佔三份之二。成年壯年的份子亦不少。青年會的「青年」是精神活潑的意思，倒不是機械的「生理年齡」。在名稱上青年會是冠上「基督教」三個字，其實非教徒的會友就佔了百分之四十。這廣大的五千人加進青年會幹麼？他們的基本信條就是：「我們三作：勞作，創作，合作」；「真正的友情好象健康，失去才覺得可貴」；「由家庭份子變為社會份子。」</p>
<p>他們此次募集經費，預定目標是三萬元，可是，因為各募捐隊的努力，及各界人士對于靑年會的信仰良好，竟超過了一千七百四十五元八角八分。今次募款共三萬二千七百四十五元八角八分。為該會的事業奠定了穩固的經濟基礎。募捐的方式是分為賜明，維漢，培正，福吾，邵麒，聯靑，重郎，培道，星島，希普，桂昌，子羊，液眞，會督，恩榮，桂芳，培英，勉道，仲謙，星五。學生等共二十一隊。結果賜明隊冠軍，募得五千零一十七元。原來林君賜明是港紳林培生先生之公子，交游頗廣而又精明能幹，熱心社會事業，故為團體建立了奇功。此外，個人咸續冠軍周兆五君，徵求人數冠軍李繼漢君，亦都是努力的幹部。</p>
<p>會員及經費說過了，他們幹什麽事業，玩什麽活動呢？在智德體群四育並重當中，經常的有：劇社練習，防空單車班，救傷事業，國難祈禱會，職工早禱曾，外國文班，英文及商科夜班，普樂專修班，國語班，簿記及珠算班，漫畫班，英語討論會，軍人服務，中華歌詠團，學界排球，初級游泳班。籃球訓總班，公開籃球：健身班，會友羽球賽，大衆兒童書攤，小童會，少年歌詠隊、中靑團朝會，防空研究班，太極拳術班，護士班，救傷隊，國語研究班，童軍演習，淸晨健身運動等。</p>
<p>還有很多是臨時的活動。而最偉大最光榮的厥爲囘國隨軍服務。（本報日前經有特寫介紹）。</p>
<p>該會以此次徵求會友及募捐成績突破紀錄、昨晚特開慰勞讌會、邀請此次出錢出力之卓著功動者共二百二十餘人。首由會長林子鹽致詞，宣佈是屆徵求的經過，繼由王愛牧師祈禱，後由鄭德超主領民衆歌詠，大衆齊歡唱，復請楊少泉演講，歷述靑年會的歷史，甚為詳細。並由彭紹賢演講在抗戰期中靑年會工作的重要性。最後由林子豐頒獎，一時掌聲雷動，健身室空氣，異常緊張。我們信相，這班出錢出力的努力靑年，在最近的將來，對我們的國家，我們的社會一定有更努力更卓著的成績表現。</p>
<p>另外有一大羣好靑年亦是可愛極了，那就應該從生活書店的廉價書傾銷運動說起：</p>
<p>我們知道，「五四」是靑年節。「五一」至「五七」是靑年運動週。這不僅是今年的新花樣，內裏亦寓有莫大的意義。為文化而努力的生活書店本着一貫的作風，自從「五四」起就來一國大規模的廉價書傾銷運動。雖然中間亦有他的「生意經」；可是這「生意經」却與文化的推廣並無抵觸。很多知識靑年從此歡騰起來，成羣結隊地擠進生活書店去。</p>
<p>廉價書的書面稍有一點點的損壞，並沒有傷及大體。最高的打一個對折，最低的只是一折。該店出版的書應有盡有，求知若渴的靑年就擠在一起　來覆去，依依不捨地留戀着。這是他們與她們所迫切要求的精神糧食，除非腰包沒有錢，誰亦不肯放鬆這個難得的機會。記者擠在裏面細細觀察，對於這些靑年朋友，內心上覺得十分愉快。據該店的負責人語記者，每天的顧客約五六百人，購書者佔百分之七十。其他百份之三十連廉價者都買不起的，就權當巡禮圖書館，「望梅止渴」「過屠大嚼」亦是樂事。</p>
<p>售廉價書每日的收入「五四」最多三百六十餘元，「五七」營業半天最少亦一百三十二元，自從「五四」至昨天一週間共傾銷廉價書一千四百九十二元。社會科學及文藝書各佔一半，顧客是學生及其他知識靑年。</p>
<p>該店廉價的時間還是繼續下去，有作為的靑年他就懂得上茶樓與上書店同樣的花錢，却是兩樣的結果，這一大群好靑年，可愛極了，</p>
<p>以上所舉二個例，無論是參加集體生活亦好，充實理論修養亦好，總之，都是香港的好靑年，香港的好靑年原不只是這些，這不過是二個具體的例子罷了，那些「荒淫與無恥」的是自掘墳驀，深願有為的靑年，朝看光明的一面，充實理論修養，參加集體生活，好在偉大的時代中生長起來！</p>

<p>一片昔榮聲浪和着嘹亮的桑子，在監道二百廿一號那幢洋樓裏透露露來，權續發出熱烈叫好的聲音，記者知道已經走到婦女兵災會主辦的閨秀名流義演團演習的所在，原來這幢洋樓是婦女兵災會主席譚世藩夫人的娘家。</p>
<p>穿紅的綠的小姐太太們，和穿洋服的老爺們，作半弧形的座在三樓客廳右頭，中央排列的是名音樂家們的位置，這算是臨時的舞台吧！</p>
<p>林卿楚小姐是一位愛國的份子，卽婦女兵災會的基本會員，這囘在紅樓夢劇中担任買太君一角，婀娜多姿，態度和靄，恰似　門命婦。劉瑞驥律師篩賈政，敵工老到，唱工甚佳。容啟榮夫人飾王夫人，態度幽嫻，自有大家風範。巧姐一角，由譚世藩夫人之女公子拱譬女士担任。天眞爛漫。　小玲瓏，其才　之佳妙，嘆為觀止。</p>
<p>隨後演習十二金　一幕，由關碧霞，辛慕緼，陸秀蓮，陸雁行、羅羽素、羅秀蘭、劉愛鸞、簡明、關瑤芝、何楚璧，文佩霞，辛慕琳，等小姐合作，輕盈的體態，在　管聲中，且歌且舞，像仙子降臨。紫羅蘭小姐悄悄地站在一角落，後來經過主事人再三教請她，詳盡地指導她們歌　的法門。</p>
<p>全體演在四個月頭的當中得薛覺先君，陳少倫君，和羅舜卿小姐，常常訓練，曁戲劇先進歐陽予倩先生，許地山先生指導，藝衛上就跨進美滿的境地。現在，訓練指導員們工作異常地緊張，因謂那「紅樓夢」「貂蟬」兩　名貴的粵劇，快要在六月一號起一連四晚在太平戲院公演，特別的多闢一「貂蟬」演劇塲。</p>
<p>各位　秀名流，亦痌　在抱，很起勁的演習，經過用人三催四請才風捲殘雲的吃了一頓晚飯，馬上就按步就班再演習「貂蟬」一劇。</p>
<p>鐘其源君飾着王允，老成持重的出來，聽了劉卓孫夫人，龐蓮愛女士飾招蟬拜月的苦衷，計上心來，利用她的色相來哄騙董卓。</p>
<p>實業界鉅子阮維揚君，個子很大，踏着那音樂的柏節登場，運着丹田的氣力，來一段雄亮的唱作，隱　有北派金少山的風度。</p>
<p>譚世藩夫人的弟弟劉卓孫君，身體魁梧，濃眉大目，像是活呂布一樣，經過化裝之後，束着髮全身甲胄，提着畫戟兒，腰懸金劍，雄風凛癝，己是先聲奪人，在這個肅穆莊嚴的空氣中，來賓們叫好不絕。</p>

<p>査會城×軍、七日被我大軍包圍、恐歸路裁斷、力圖掙扎、是日以空軍助戰、開我陣地狂炸、一方面用平射炮猛烈轟擊、掩護×兵衝出、但我軍沉着應戰、密集火力射擊、游擊團隊更利用地形、迂週邀擊、斃×三百餘、七日晚、×機不能出動、我軍團攻益烈、翌（八日）晨×勢已疲、仍希圖扼險死守、我第五游擊縱隊又由單水口方面、出擊會城之西、勇猛衝殺、一度衝入惠民門肉搏、至下午二時許、因戰略關係、暫行退出、是日復斃×百餘、幷奪護戰利品甚衆、三時後激戰稍緩、入夜再轉激烈、槍炮聲澈夜不休、</p>
<p>兩路夾擊收復會城</p>
<p>至九日上午十一時許、我鄧龍光剖及桂軍某部、配合游擊隊、再度圍攻會城、當卽在城郊之新鶴公路發生激戰、×軍力圖掙扎、但我士氣壯盛、有進無退、幷由某部撲攻新鶴公路江門至會城叚、斷×歸路、至下午三時許、×不支、又恐歸途無路、仍紛向江門潰退、我軍當將會城收復、啣尾追擊、迫近江門市郊之紫泥等鄉、將×包圍、現江門之×、已成孤軍、克復江門、指日可待、</p>
<p>容奇方面×忽增兵</p>
<p>容奇方面、×軍因會城被我猛攻、已無力兼顧、僅由大良方面抽調僞警駐守、惟自八日起、忽由九江大良方面增派×兵四百餘人開赴容奇駐守、幷在各街道及要隘構築防禦工事、挖掘機關槍陣地與砲位、工作甚形忙碌、察×此舉、似因不逞于新會鶴山、而有據此以爲向他方窺伺模樣、</p>
<p>騷擾中山團隊嚴防</p>
<p>至中山方面、近旬沿海帶雖稍安謐、惟×艦汽船時到近海地方如企人石、潭洲發炮轟擊、掃射機槍、此種恫嚇手段、已司空見慣、惟我方團隊爲預防萬一起見、已在沿海各要點、增加防禦力量、第一區游擊別動隊司令袁帶、除飭屬準備外、一面更在某地與大軍取得聯絡、以制×死命云、</p>

<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>【民革社單水口通訊】單水口爲四邑交通之咽喉，×人垂涎已久。此埠曾於廿三夜一度　×侵擾，其時記者適在與單水口相隔一衣帶之水的海門，軍爭情報均能一一親聆。茲將這一夜的情形略誌如下：</p>
<p>廿三晨××團的情報是：我軍已將會城×包園，不難一舉　　。五時餘又得一情報，謂×汽艇，艘擾大澤，被我軍擊退。入夜時分，記者抵海門，會見××團的吳團附，那時電話正送來一個情報，說牛灣發現無燈火的電船三艘，並有×汽艇蹤跡。其後吳圖附卽分電各軍事機關。一致戒備。並親自出發督導</p>
<p>九時許，又有一電話來說：有輪渡拖木船五隻自牛灣開囘，拒絕檢査，已開過公益了。接了這情報後，莫服務員極爲着急，深恐這些船會有×人混跡其中。</p>
<p>午夜時分，一聲槍響打破了沉寂，吸引着我們的注意。接來打電話向各處杳詢，所得的報告是這樣：公益警長出巡，向一警察喝令，因口令有出入，卽放槍　擊。</p>
<p>是夜二時許，記者正想休息的時　，忽然又聞一輪機槍聲。據莫服務員談：這種槍聲與我軍所放的不同。恐×人眞已偷入，但因沒有其他動靜，記者即躺在門板上睡覺了。</p>
<p>晨早五時許（仕四日），一個換班歸來的士兵到來談稱：當他在守工事之際，一壯丁隊員經過這裏，對他說：「喂！×人登陸了，你還在這裏睡覺！」他說時，聲音放得很低；像在說故事，記者於半睡中亦不以爲意。</p>
<p>士兵走後，記者亦起床。看看時鐘已將六時，天甚明亮了。洗　後出外散步，一位同行的黃君奔囘報告，說有×人汽艇出現在海濱。記者不信，正欲前往一看，就在那一瞬間×人的大炮樹搶已一齊轟起來了。記者亦以爲×人在海門登陸，也隨着如蟻的人群逃難了。</p>
<p>隔了幾大，記者又坐艇親到單水視察，見沿河的船艇甚少。登岸後，入銀龍路。悄無人影，倒毀了的樓房六七家，餘均緊閉鬥戶，轉走大興路，亦見斷櫻折棟甚多。拐了一個彎入中興路，街心中玻璃片與瓦礫亂堆着，兩邊的幾家房屋，也已變成了廢瓦類垣，再入維新路、這是一條　街。被炸得最厲害，幾隻燕子低低地在瓦礫間穿飛着，益增荒凉之意。那時遇見了一位武裝的士兵，同行的何君卽詢問他××長官的所在。</p>
<p>麻雀咽　着；我們又踏入了最綿長的中山路，詳視各店門多貼上「下午啟市」「看門留此」之類的字條到中山路的中段時，見到一座削去了檐頂的古廟，何君告訴記者說：『這是開平縣立第三小學的故址，月前被×機炸成了這個　子，』記者細視着，見那裏的門前，有兩個剝晚了紙膜的大燈籠斜吊着，磚牆上橫爲着一行紅色的標語：『軍民合作武裝保衛單水口！』</p>
<p>走盡了中山路訪問開平弟三區集訓大隊第一中隊長譚君。據譚君談談×方確曾於四月廿三日晚上九時餘偷入到這裏來，登岸卽往附近各鄉村行刼，劫去白銀，番薯及畜生（猪和雞）頗多，並强迫鄉民搬落艇內日翌日，因恐我前方大軍　絕歸路，不能逃生，下午四時許卽退去，因此『三埠亦曾一度緊張。』</p>
<p>『那麼，我們沒有抵抗嗎？』記者問。</p>
<p>『是的，因爲我大軍在前方，本隊隊員亦多在大澤一帶服務，只留少數隊員守衛，又因槍枝不齊備沒有怎樣抵抗過。』譚君答。</p>
<p>『有多少×人登陸呢？』記者問。</p>
<p>『大概一共百餘人，隊伍非常零亂，分乘着十三　汽艇登陸。』</p>
<p>『那　，爲什麼天亮時×人又大開槍砲呢？』記者問。</p>
<p>『大槪有兩個原因：第一，曾有某方面開槍射擊他們，×人卽大肆趁威了，第二，是以槍砲掩護搬運東西。』另一位隊員答。</p>
<p>『×人放砲雖多，但多是沒有子彈的空砲呢！』站在記者旁邊的一位武裝同志插嘴說。</p>
<p>記者憶想着那天的砲聲，的確有許多是聽不到子彈攅動的尖昔，不禁笑了一笑　着又問；</p>
<p>『這次的損失大嗎？』</p>
<p>『並不怎樣大，不過×人的　行留下了一筆極大的血債，（人除搶刦外，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　』譚君言下，透露着憐憫與憤悵。</p>
<p>後來計者往×軍上陸處巡視，見那附近的一家船廠已拆毀了。</p>
<p>巡視一週後，到××團辦事處去，知道單水口駐有我大軍，今晨又有一都開赴前綫。</p>
<p>從此次單水口之被×人偷襲，我們可得一個最明顯的教訓，迂迴戰是×人一貫的戰略，前綫固需重兵，後方也需用相當的兵力嚴密戒備！</p>

<h3 id="c46">華雷斯皮業　離婚前之家庭 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>上星期連諾城的法官，爲着一對已結合十五年的夫婦、進行離婚手續、這對夫婦就是華雷斯皮萊和麗泰姬曼、且看他們以前是怎樣一个家庭、</p>
<p>他們是在一九二四年結婚的、那時　泰還在「羅賓漢」中做臨時演員、結婚後她就拋棄了拍電影的工作、</p>
<p>皮萊夫人和華雷斯的結婚還是第一次、至於華雷斯却是第二次了、他以前一度是史璜生的丈夫、</p>
<p>結婿後沒有孩子、皮萊認爲一個家庭非有孩子不可、後來　泰的母親的異父姊妹夏妮泰一死、留下三個孩子、卡洛安便是內中之一、那時還只兩歲、皮萊夫妻兩人便在一九三二年三月、把卡洛安領過來認爲乾女兒、非常快樂、</p>
<p>皮萊的愛卡洛安、實勝過親生的父親、訪問者們摸着他的脾氣、知道如果用那女小孩做談話題目、他就肯漸漸把一切都講出來了、</p>
<p>看見銀幕上的最環男子在攝影場的食堂裏替卡洛安切菜、是很平常的事、他陪伴她吃飯比陪伴甚麼女朋友吃飯都高興、</p>
<p>一般的做影星的父母、都不喜歡自己的孩子被人攝影、但是華雷斯反喜歡卡洛安讓別人照相、因爲他抱定主意想使兒女也成一明星、有一張片子裏他還給她上過鏡頭呢、</p>
<p>華雷斯有四椿心愛的——他的妻子、他的工作、他的飛機、他的女兒卡洛安、最愛的當然是卡洛安了、</p>
<p>婚後生活、雖然復快樂、但是並不平靜、曾發生過一樁事件使兩人很痛苦、有一個歌女聲稱皮萊是她腹內的孩子的父親、起了訴訟要拿出十萬元給她、經過一場風波、後來證明那女子患神經病、才算了結、也沒有拿出一個錢、那女子一度也曾告過李却狄克司的、</p>
<p>十年之前、同他的學友學習飛行術時突息中風、幸而那學友有些本領、沒有使飛機跌落、以後就有一年半未上銀幕、當時人們始以爲他不能再上銀幕、然而一九三一那年他終於回銀幕下、薪金每星期七千五百元外、每本片子還有拆頭、</p>
<p>一九三二年的不景氣、他也受到很大損失、有家銀行倒閉、他有四萬八千元存欽沒有取出、</p>
<p>可是這筆損失不多時就抵債了、卡洛安到他家中來、比給他黃金鄧更有價值呢</p>
<p>麗泰對人說過丈夫樣樣都好、只是一椿她必同他爭吵、因爲丈夫有飛行的執照、又自己有飛機、到什麼地方去他都要坐飛機、但是她却極端反對、只願意陸上旅行的、雖則他對於新的女兒已負上責任、也不能阻止他不上天空、</p>
<p>由於飛行的喜歡不喜歡、常常牽涉到別的事情的爭論上去、漸漸的兩人間便發生了不陸、約在一年之前、兩人帶了卡洛安旅行歐洲、回來時都發覺不能冉在一處快樂生活、所以决定了分居、爲了卡洛安的綠故、儘可能不讓外面人知道、</p>
<p>隔不多時、他們竟然到連路城去辦理離婚手續了、皮萊夫人說對於將來並無計劃、她不想再上銀幕、但歡喜找些無綫電播音工作、她說、『我對於他一點沒有使他感覺爲難的要求、免得影響他的事業、總之、我須體諒他的一切、這次離婚實是非常友善的、』</p>
<p>「在他的生活中並沒有別的女子、我也沒有別的男子、」</p>
<p>沒有、他的確沒有、連卡洛安也失去了、</p>
<p>那個女孩子跟着她母親住在連諾、</p>

<p>一星期一星期的過去，他注意到陶麗絲往各處旅行歌唱的合同，幷未簽訂成功。她自己說是要等待良佳的機會，目前就有很多人要她簽訂合同，但是過分性急也沒有用，里奧拿對於這點很是懷疑。她倒也覺察出來了，于是她也只得和僅一個請他簽訂合同的人簽訂了下來。那個人不過是個第二流的　理者，要她簽訂一張在某電影院內表演一星期的合同，也只不過是利用她的社會地位的背景而已。</p>
<p>可是她簽訂台同的事，里奧拿當時沒有知道。他正因『業務』關係在華盛頓。波鐵摩，費拉台爾費稚等處旅行。甘實呢。他却在作初次的昔樂會登台歌唱。用了個假名挿在密司卡伐的節目單上，算是美國的新的中音歌者。他的突然的非常成功，實是可驚。非但受到聽眾的瘋狂一樣的歡迎，而且速伴奏的人也認爲所聽到的中音歌唱家中是他最好</p>
<p>他接着便要往西部旅行表演，中間只有一小時的空閒，便　着他的性急的經理人　西來到紐約。他一路回家，辛澀地笑着。她旅行沒有成功，反而他倒要去旅行了！好吧，這錢容易賺，况且他確實需要錢，他的建築公司也需要。</p>
<p>囘到寓所，他看見陶麗絲睡在床上。旁邊有看護和許多朋友照料。陶麗絲在電影院登台過。所得到的却是聽衆　的喝倒采，所以當時她就暈倒了。「你早就對我說過，』她對他話，『我不該已歌——不錯。我現在明白了，我愛，我不再歌唱了！』</p>
<p>當她這麼說，里奧拿自己想找說話告訴她關於自己的歌唱的成功。可是他不能。在這時候告訴她未免過分使她難堪了。他溫存的擁抱了她。可是她忽然想起晚上母親家裏有宴會，要請他去。唉，這個他是不能拒絕的。愛情和婚姻比音樂會旅行重要得多。</p>
<p>陶麗絲說道，「我却不去參加母親的宴會，因爲她是爲了慶祝我簽訂電影院登台歌唱的合同的成功！」</p>
<p>她終於到宴會的。還欣然把被人喝倒采的事告訴人家。突然里奥拿嚇獃了，看見密司卡伐在門上進來。她也是白萊夫人的客人之一，因爲白萊夫人在數月前的市政廳陶麗絲的音樂會中會見過她，於是，不到半小時，里奧拿最懼怕的事情發生了。</p>
<p>由於卡伐的誤解，惱怒里奧拿把同她向西部旅行開音樂會的事實隱別人　，所以她宜露出里奧拿能够歌唱的情由。丈母娘和妻子表示不信，里奧拿便真的唱歌來加以証明。</p>

<p>（本報專訊）旭和杯足球爭標戰、鐵定月之十三（星期六）日下午四時半在加路連山舉行、由南華會隊對海軍隊、此　球事、乃六大錦標賽之尾聲、而我華隊能否包辦錦標、創一光榮紀錄、化關　亦在是、值此最後關頭、結果奚若、有賴於南華球人之　足輕重也、</p>
<p>埠際隊已於九日班師、南華球人畢集、若愼配一完整陣綫以應付海軍、則勝利似無問題、句辦錦標之偉舉、斯可完成矣、惟李惠堂昨對記者稱、梁榮照、黎兆榮二人、足處創傷猶未痊可、尚須休餋、本週末之旭和杯决賽、事關重要、决不官選用　黎二人扶傷上陣、致誤戎機、憶港隊在菲第二戰、正因調傷勢未愈之梁黎登場、實爲失計、遂遭敗續、旣有前車可鑑、不可不愼、故南華此次人選、應捨梁黎而取錄別人云云、</p>
<p>至惠堂之足傷、亦未全愈、故本週末是否爲南華効力、尚未可知、記者默祝李氏及早無恙、屆時得　與戎行、以增强前鋒線之攻力、則勝利更有把握也、</p>
<p>目下南華球人有因足部受傷未愈者、旣數名之多、且皆爲得力份子、則此次應付海軍之編陣問題、頗費思索、不可不審愼取材、以求制勝之方、否則功虧一策、　為可惜、故記者特為擬一完善陣綫、若用以迎戰海軍、庶　勝利可圖、但未悉負　選人者、亦表同情否、所擬陣綫如下、（球埸太歲）</p>

<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>本港埠際足球隊、遠征菲島、三戰兩敗、僅免全師覆沒之臟、全隊業于九日返港、隊長李惠堂、對出征經過、爲文誌之、對敗陣之原因、及競賽之經過、詳述無遺、特照刊出、以饜讀者、</p>
<p>前衛編配　頗費躊躇</p>
<p>余往昔嘗言、球戰勝負、有時奇幻莫測、不可預料、其最後之結果、與乎其中幸運之　變、冥冥中似存有定數有非人力所可更易强求者、證睹吾隊四月卅日在菲之首次夜戰、定數之說、益堅余信矣、先是、隊友早發之會咸以天氣醫熱、多以通宵未得安眠爲怨者、幸吾人以大戰在　、日間酬酢、一槪謝絕、冀得多　養息、午食曅、乃商討吾隊前衛綫結構問題、良以四前衛中、榮照足傷未痊、葛尼胃病尤劇、材盡于斯、頗費躊躇、審愼思量、卒以榮照足傷爲不足恃、乃以左列十一人應付此幕埠際賽也、</p>
<p>譚均幹　施漢　李天生菲　葛尼大　比路度　蘇喬打　侯澄滔　吿山奴　李惠堂　馮景祥　奄巴臣</p>
<p>觀客擠擁　盛況空前</p>
<p>吾人以球事準八時卅分啓　、提前于六時進晚食、七時許、爲利于夜戰辨織計、乃白衣　褲、戎裝　發、（敗後有謂吾人衣白袍爲不詳之兆者、何迷信之深也）、抵場時、人聲鼎沸、萬頭鑽動、據菲當局言、自一九三四年遠運以還、實以今宵之會爲最盛也、臨賽排隊台前、由余逐一介紹隊友、與全菲體育協進會會長危嘉士君、握手相見、八時半、兩陣對圖、港裁判員奧馬銀笛一聲、動員令下、兩三傳　、余得大告之接濟、聲球深入敵陣、距門廿碼許、方擬舉足叩關、不虞敵衛三四、左右夾持、前後走撞、一時踣地者數人、余亦以是受傷、右腿大筋、痛楚雖堪、動彈不得、此開戰時緊張之一刹那、遂爲港隊之致命傷、余得隊友一度治理後、雖仍勉力從軍、但心餘力細、恍若路人、自知經此一變、軍心搖動、以寡迎衆、敗績難逃、思念及茲、內心難過、匪首可喻、而深　造化之有意弄人也、</p>
<p>前後受敵　遂遭敗績</p>
<p>前鋒綫已减削進攻力、前衛又散溃不聯絡、後方遂陷苦戰、上半時、數瀕于危、幸均幹妙手囘春、屢挽狂瀾、軺以不失、然後防諸友、已疲態畢露、不堪再戰、明知失足祇時間題、果于下半時連失三關、不可救藥、而敵焰斯際、炙手可熱、幾有予取予携之勢、差幸隊友、不辭艱巨、努力拒敵、于天時地理絕對不慣之情况下、仍能抗戰到底、臨完費目爲大告以頭球拔囘一城、隊友因余之傷、各均加勞無怨、良足感佩、而此、第一屆在菲舉行之埠際賽、港隊遂以一比三屈居人下、國產球迷、多感失望、然定數如此、夫復何言、總之、吾隊失敗、廠結有四、</p>
<p>致敗原因　共有四點</p>
<p>（一）此地天氣、以此兩日爲最熱、隊友均感失眠、精神萎頓、作戰遂不能持久、（二）晚間爲戰、吾隊半屬初試、高球每覺吃虧、（三）英軍多未臨大敵、遂有怯場之弊、瞎踢盲傳、遠不及平時水準、奄巴臣尤覺不濟、使人念及廣森、即最近猛晋之英琪、亦遠麼葛尼、菲殊窩打輩、況榮照又缺埸、尤使前　崩潰、國人不當、亦一要因也、（四）余之登場受傷、人多謂爲敵之隊謀早蓄、有意加客、姑不齡其是否有心、惟禍來過遠、全隊心裏、遭受巨大變化、求其不敗、尤鳥可得，以上所云、全爲事實經過、非敗後用以掩飾，况各員始終努力、人事已盡、非戰之　、均幹尢勞苦功高、使人叫絕、余則中心自疚、雖禍非　自取、然間接實敗績之苗、責無旁貸也、菲隊與征港時更易四員，經月除之苦練、聯絡純熟、氣力充盈、表演較在港時　佳、惟吾隊實力不完、此賽實不足爲非隊之試金石、此番雖勝，亦未有超越　藝之顯露、不過作戰迅速，夜戰得宜，其戰鬥精神、亦足多者、客隊苟無充沛氣力、優良球術、殊不易以言勝也，哥　登、西貢奐星中華之在此厙速挫折、奚足怪哉、</p>

<p>— 荘瑞源</p>
<p>利西的三花牌用完了。好拉所了抽履，一下子便搬出半打的粉盒子，但是，全用完了。</p>
<p>好想，今天有個好太陽，而我的臉上有太多雀斑。</p>
<p>還有什麼好說的？『後方』居然給她這总想不到的失望，若然她還在上海，如所想得到的東西一件件全買得到，她所買不到的東西是她想都想不起來的。可是現在，不待她想，連不能沒有的東西也沒有了。三花牌是可以缺貨的嗎？今天有那麼好的太陽幾天以來，差不多爲着凍雨闷在家裏。今天她已經不能不出去，『而我的臉上有太多雀斑。』</p>
<p>她在沙發上坐下，要不是坐在沙發上，她的臉要对着梳粧台的鏡子：在房間裏有着第二個人的時候，更是她的三花牌用完了時的候，她不愛梳粧台，因爲那多少有點過於舖張，整潔的背景把她的驗　得彷彿有看更多的麻點。她只愛手皮袋裏的一面小鏡。但是她如果還能記起，那梳粧台是她租定了這間房子時一個男子送給她的；而那隻手皮袋裏和全付的化裝用具是她從另外一個男子的手裏接這來，那時她是多麼驚異而感激着。</p>
<p>究竟費了高價替一個異性買化裝用具，或是僱了兩偶僕人把一隻笨重的梳粧台抬到她的新居來，在習慣上還是平凡的事。利茜甚至忘記了，至少她也得裝出像忘記了的樣子。她需要爲着一件禮物說兩次感謝的話嗎？還顯然不需要而且也不願意；唯正是她要做嶄新的女性。</p>
<p>她以爲，一個嶄新的女性是應該有嶄新的生活的，她的所謂嶄新的生活便是說應該有三花牌。有異性朋友，而對這些異性的朋友她不能說太多感謝的話，卽使她所接受的禮品是高價買來的</p>
<p>現在還有什麼可說的？她越想越懊悔，爲什麼離開上海的時候不多買一點。經過香港的時候不是也可以買一點壞？這麼的每家百貨商店他全拜訪過，她的臉上已經沒有三花牌了。</p>
<p>她又想到剛才接到的一個電話，她想像着，貼在那邊電話機旁的是一張直綫型的臉。一張愛說話的嘴，那張嘴想該是在闊領帶上說着話吧，於是他要想起她的話來。</p>
<p>而且他已經答應了他的請求了；他馬上就要來，來了她得陪他到郊外去玩，當然晚飯是在上等館千轟吃的，利西只需要在吃了飯以後拿出手組來擦一下自己的嘴，用手組掩著嘴很婉約地笑一下便不需要任何感謝的話了。</p>
<p>但是，她還不能解脫那　總着她的煩悶，沒有三花牌的日子過得下去嗎？來到了這麼遙遠的後方，她可以安靜地　下來，可是沒有三花牌的日子是她從前所想像不到的，她个能不這樣想下去，今天有憫好太陽，而我的臉上有太多雀斑。</p>
<p>從前，那是多麼富購的日子，她的日常生活裏沒有一點點物質的缺乏，她是物質地耗損着日子的，她　至未曾想她在一些角落上沒有三花牌，現在她已經在這遙遠的後方把三花牌的日子過完，幾天以前。差不多全爲着凍雨悶在家裏，今天有個好太陽……</p>
<p>一個機智突然來到她的思　裏，使她愉快得幾乎跳起來。沒有把自己用三花牌美　起來是不能陪一個男朋友過半天甚至一分鏱的。她抓起了手皮袋，尖起嘴吹鹽着愉快的調于，便跑出房間。</p>
<p>她吩咐着老媽于，說是有人來找她的時候，謂他　等一等，她到街上去一次馬上社回來的。</p>
<p>當然，利西是不高興再跟百貨商店的店員糾纏的了，她跑出她的柳家菴的住所，一個晴朗的天氣在鬥階上等候着她，溫煦的陽光灑着她的橋　的旂袍她的臉——</p>
<p>她到理髪室裏去。</p>
<p>三刻鐘以後，利西是浴在美　的光輝中了，她的臉是那麼　白，粉　，而且發散着一種芳芬的氣味。她已經爲着自己的美麗而喜悅着</p>
<p>雖然在這三刻鐘裏她得花費許多錢，這仿彿使她對後方還存着一點不滿。是的，一切是那麼昂貴，有些人每天在吃三頓靑蠶豆的事實她是不會知道的，她所知道的只是寧願付出高昂的價當還買不到三花牌，和自己的臉有着太多雀斑。</p>
<p>她跑出理髮室，叫一　黃包車囘柳家巷去。</p>
<p>『三毫錢』</p>
<p>『一角半好啦。』</p>
<p>『兩毫錢我拉你去。』</p>
<p>『一毫八分。』</p>
<p>『小姐，我拉你囘去。』這穿挿進來的聲音使她回過臉去看，她看見一張直轉型的臉，一張裳說話的嘴，那張嘴在顧領帶上說着這句話。</p>
<h3 id="c60">投奔無門 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>——淪陷區的悲劇之一</p>
<p>像　入自己的家門一樣地。×人由大亞　登陸後，散漫的隊伍邁向惠陽前進，沒有遇到使人興奮的抵抗，也沒有炮彈的敬禮，使在燦　的抗戰史頁上裏上了一國微小的黑點！</p>
<p>恐怖的黑雲　蓋著每個人的心，惠陽的市民開始東奔西走了。鄕村間有山陣水隔，又是那麼僞僻，×人不會光臨到甲？于是幾萬的市民，携男帶女。提笈負要，　山涉水，踏着夜路走向荒野的鄕村去了。</p>
<p>一個異地的師範教員，慧敏而美麗，而且還是一個懷春少女呢。在風聲鶴唳中，她像農家之狗似地向城外的鄕村投奔。</p>
<p>首先，她氣息喘喘地走到一個十多里外的鄉村，誠應地要求鄕人們借給她一角地方躲避；但鄕人們異口同聲地囘答：</p>
<p>『不，你是一個剪髪姑娘，請勿留這裏』！</p>
<p>她揩着眼淚，懷着無限的失望轉向別一個村落去。</p>
<p>同樣，沒有人國意借給她一角暫時的寄宿地；甚至，連她想在那裏多休息一刻也被拒絕。他們拒絕的理由是：</p>
<p>日×鬼子很快就到了，倘若他們知這還　藏着有剪髪的漂亮姑娘，必定勒迫交出來，這麼一來就拖果着全村了！</p>
<p>她疲乏得透不過氣來，驗上也剝去了血色層，呈現着死的灰白，但她還咬着牙關，疲乏地繼續着走。</p>
<p>天空海關，定到那裏去？她哭襄地在田野的泥徑上徘徊躑躅了。當求生的火餞靈新燃起了她凝冷了的心時。她的僅餘的體力又推動着她的雙脚向前走，走到另一個鄉村去，再敲她的生命之門。</p>
<p>沒有兩樣，第三個鄉村也被『自私』和『恐怖』築成了一道她不能　越的高繼</p>
<p>她在那村門外睜着白眼，木偶似的站了許久，又絕望地向茫然的泥路上踽行。</p>
<p>走不了幾步，疲乏綑住了她的脚，恐怖僵結了她的心；一陣晴天的　風吹倒了她的柔弱的生命！</p>
<p>就在那天，她的父親用六百元的巨資，遣人為一　專車來糯接她逃走，但她已突著不能轉動的睽珠，緊閉著不能開合的牙縫，價臥在那荒漠的田野上，一切全不知　了。</p>
<h3 id="c61">論詩歌大眾化 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 寒波</p>
<p>——關于「中國詩壇」的復刊——</p>
<p>時歡在民間發芽成長，詩歌道出了社會一般底呼聲。原則上詩歌該是屬于大衆的。</p>
<p>然而幾千年來傳統的習慣，卻把時歌底創作者與大眾隔離了，一般人認篇時是神秘玄妙的東西，詩人爲淸雅祟高不食煙火底特殊階級，也有些人抱了另一種見　，指出詩底「風花雪月」與詩人底『脫　琪實』，無論從那一方面　來，都是距離大衆極還的，因此『詩人』在中國成了超然者『　歌』使人們無從問離。</p>
<p>『詩歌大眾化』在這種形情下，爲了要祖起它的時代使命，乃成爲一椿極爲迫切的任務。</p>
<p>許多人熱心地討論着這個課題，原則與路徑不厭求詳地再三申說着，但可憾的「理論」依然　祇限于「理論」，實踐工作終是太少了，我們雖有了若干朗誦詩底出現，也祇是零居的幾許罷了。</p>
<p>以一個新的姿態出現，『中國詩壇』底復刊，不但給荒凉的抗戰詩壇栽培了一塊佳壤，且在詩歌大衆化方面也是一枝有力的先鋒，他集合了一個大集團底力量，用樸素底筆調傳達出抗戰的動向與心靈的感應。題材是現實的，字句是淸新易　的，不會令人覺得生澀；更不會同牘　在玩弄些「僞美麗」的電調兒　　，要是你並不十分忙的話，盡可以一口氣地把廿餘首詩篇全部贖完。</p>
<p>可是詩歌大衆化並不軍是「懂」與『不　』閽問題，息利雅諾夫會說：</p>
<p>『　術須把大衆的情感思想，和意志聯合起來，而加以鼓勵。』</p>
<p>高購基更騙綢地說過：</p>
<p>『詩人不能不呼應一切的音樂，呼應一切的生活的呼聲。』</p>
<p>換句話說，詩人必須把自己的心靈融化大衆之間，一切爲了大衆而努力，那才會創造出『大衆詩歌』而使『詩歌大衆化』。就這方面論，『中國詩壇』所收獲的——成績並不十分差，蒲風的『我穿上了土裝』，我認爲是最好的一篇，至若要鑪到純粹詩歌大衆化的境地。則這價刊物目前還是不能十分滿意的，詞句如何鍛鍊得更爲通俗，內容如何更求其接近大衆，都是詩歌大衆化過程中最重要的關鍵。</p>
<p>不過就最低限度而言，『中國詩壇』至少已洗凈了那神秘而玄虛的外衣了。</p>

<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>經過曲江——這個廣東戰時都會，意外地碰見了一大羣救亡工作同志。他們大家都是從廣州最後退出。分發西江以及南路一帶工作，而最近才匯集到這個地方來的。</p>
<p>他們穿着草靑的服裝，踏著草鞋，有許多已經參加了武裝部隊，束着皮帶，戴上軍帽，臉上雖是顯出了飽經風霜的樣子，可是却有著健康的美；他們嘴事常常唱出雄壯而愉快的歌聲，但音調也比在廣州時較爲沉著老練。一切都表現出從艱苦實踐中，練過的苦幹精神。</p>
<p>在路上，常常有久別重逢的工作同志，互相握着熱烈的手，互相致懇　的問訊：</p>
<p>『×同志，怎麼你也來了這裏？』</p>
<p>『是的，我們西江行署××隊調來這爲受訓，你來了好久吧？』</p>
<p>『不；我們抗先總隊部從上月才　到這裏的。你們來受訓以後打算怎樣？』</p>
<p>『我們集訓一月，以後分發各游　區工作啦！』</p>
<p>『這個工作很有意思，望你們多多努力。』</p>
<p>『笑話笑話。你們經驗豐富，給我們多多指教才好』；『××同志呢？』</p>
<p>『他在軍委會第×工政大隊，快要開到高要一帶去了，你要見見他麼？』</p>
<p>是的，很想會會他——他底小Miss怎樣了？』</p>
<p>『小Miss也跟他一塊兒來了，他倆一塊兒住在××喝，一塊兒工作。還比前積極了呢！人家都說，這次抗戰拆飲了許多鴛鴦，也做成了許多雙鴛鴦，眞是不錯啊！哈哈。』</p>
<p>『哈哈，究竟戀愛和革命是沒有　突的。』</p>
<p>「喂，你的通訊處是那裏？」</p>
<p>『我們是×地鄭箱××號轉；你的呢？』</p>
<p>『你寫第×十×軍郵　交便得了。』</p>
<p>『好的，再會，以後多通訊指教呀；』</p>
<p>『再會！努力！』</p>
<p>他們熱烈地握手以後，忙着分頭公幹去了。</p>
<p>一連幾天都是忽晴忽雨，已被×機炸毀了四分三以上的曲江縣城，路上行人比平日稀少了，然而經過風度北路警報樓下面的民衆，都不期然地駐足在觀看璧報，這兒有『大家　』，『每日時事嬰聞，』還有漫　，標　，國難地圖，軍政機關的報告，警報布告牌……。尤其是璧報很出色，有通俗的時事解說，歌　，用舊形式寫的抗戰故事，字體寫得端正，較大，有簡單色彩線　的裝飾，點綴得大字美觀，新鮮活潑。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Aggressor's Two-Sided Game <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"Sword in hand, scripture in the other" is the consistent policy of aggressors throughout history, both ancient and modern, and the familiar tune sung by so-called "heroic soldiers." In recent days, this phenomenon has reappeared on the European political stage, and with more vigor than any previous scene. On one hand, the long-brewing German-Italian military alliance is set to be signed at the beginning of next month, further solidifying political cooperation between aggressors. On the other hand, Rome has disseminated news of a five-nation conference involving the Pope and England, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland. Even more strangely, while German anti-Polish propaganda continues unabated, and machine-gun nests are being built along the Prussian border, Italy is feigning an offer of mediation to Poland.</p>
<p>While we dare not immediately suspect the Pope's proposal is a smokescreen instigated by Mussolini, the intentions behind Italy's mediation of the German-Polish dispute are certainly insidious. Hitler has supported Mussolini, and Mussolini must reciprocate with bloodless schemes to aid Hitler. Germany is determined to seize Danzig and the Polish Corridor. Germany is not only intensifying its anti-Polish propaganda domestically, but also concentrating heavy troops on the border between the two countries, and setting up a network of National Socialist Party uprisings in Danzig and Poland. London's "Daily Telegraph" rightly predicts: "The Danzig National Socialist Party will request annexation by Germany to Hitler. At this time, Poland, to protect its interests, will immediately send troops to Danzig, and Hitler can use this as an excuse to accuse Poland of being the aggressor." At this point, all mediation will be ineffective. The Danzig National Socialist Party is fully armed, and German heavy troops have already pressed to the Danzig border. Does Mussolini not know Hitler's destination?</p>
<p>Since the fact of the German-Italian military alliance was formally announced by the two countries, the entire European political stage has been shaken. The focus of the problem is no longer limited to Eastern Europe, but also involves the Mediterranean. This is a direct and pressing issue for Italy. To ease the attention of England and France, Mussolini might as well adopt a temporarily conciliatory tone. Such two-sided performances, with aggressors singing of peace while their hands are stained with blood, are not surprising. Most incomprehensible, however, is that Britain is also preparing to mediate the German-Polish dispute with other signatory countries of the "Danzig Treaty." Chamberlain even declared: "Britain welcomes friendly mediation solutions to the Danzig issue." Previously, when the dispute between Germany and Czechoslovakia became very serious, and German public opinion most vehemently attacked Czechoslovakia, Britain also mediated the German-Czech dispute with the "Munich Agreement," but what was the result? Czechoslovakia was certainly destroyed, and the power of England and France was completely distrusted by the world's smaller nations.</p>
<p>Britain's recent handling of disputes in various parts of the world has certainly deteriorated, appearing very clever on the surface, but actually harming smaller countries and not benefiting itself. Even Japan sees this point clearly and has dared to launch a probe into Britain's Far East attitude at a time when the European crisis is deepening and England is somewhat overwhelmed. Last night, Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Mamoru hosted a banquet for the Foreign Secretary and other dignitaries, and suggested to the British Foreign Secretary the intention to adjust Anglo-Japanese diplomacy. How Britain will deal with this important development is a matter worth noting.</p>
<p>Today, Britain is not only facing serious problems in Europe, but in the Far East, Japan's offensive against Britain is also pressing step by step. Japan's counterfeit currency policy has not only been implemented in North China but is also preparing to be implemented in Central China. Britain's Far East trade will be plundered by Japan. Today, if Britain wants to cope with this difficult situation of being attacked on two fronts, it must have extremely clever methods. As Lloyd George said: "If Germany and Italy send troops, without the support of the Soviet Union, even the sum of England, France, and Poland would find it difficult to make good on guarantees to Poland, Romania, and Greece." Today's situation is more dangerous than during the European War, and there is one more Japan in the Far East. If England and France do not cooperate with the Soviet Union, it will be really difficult to cope with ease.</p>
<p>The aggressors are singing a two-sided game, but what exactly is the decision made by England and France?</p>
<h3 id="e2">East River Youth in the Face of War The Tasks and Guidelines of the East River Youth Movement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Heng</p>
<p>(1) Promoting the Revolutionary Spirit of East River Youth</p>
<p>East River Youth in the Era of the Great Revolution</p>
<p>As early as the era of the Great Revolution, the East River Youth League had a vigorous development. We say that Guangdong is the source of the Chinese revolution, and we should say that East River is an important link in the Guangdong revolution. During the era of the Great Revolution, revolutionary flames ignited everywhere in East River. In Haifeng, Lufeng, Huiyang, Zijin, and Wuhua, there was a history of great and heroic revolution. The East River youth have a revolutionary tradition.</p>
<p>Today, as the War of Resistance is about to enter its second phase, moving towards a more difficult and serious stage, which is to say, today as the objective situation urgently requires us to strengthen unity and strive for progress throughout the country, let us all carry forward the past revolutionary spirit of the East River youth, in order to answer the Japanese attempt to launch a new offensive towards the Southwest.</p>
<p>The Low Tide of the East River Youth Movement</p>
<p>Following the end of the era of the Great Revolution, the East River Youth League also entered a stage of low tide. Due to the unfavorable objective environment for the development of the people's movement, the East River Youth Movement gradually transitioned from a low tide to almost ending the life of the Youth Movement. During this period, it was no longer possible to see the burning of great revolutionary flames everywhere. The youth movement was gone. Naturally, there were still a very few young people who continued to pursue the truth, trying to add fuel to the torch of revolution, hoping that this torch of revolution would not be extinguished forever!</p>
<p>(2) East River Youth in Battle The East River Youth Movement is Revived</p>
<p>If we divide the East River Youth Movement into several stages, then the era of the Great Revolution is the first stage, the period from the end of the revolutionary era to before the outbreak of the War of Resistance is the second stage, which is also the low tide period, and after the outbreak of the War of Resistance is the third stage. The main feature of this stage is that the East River Youth Movement is revived.</p>
<p>After the start of the War of Resistance, the East River youth once again felt the importance of their mission. Everyone unanimously believed that: the masses are the main force in resisting Japan, and the victory of the War of Resistance is absolutely inseparable from the development of the people's movement. The youth movement plays a pioneering role in the national liberation movement, inspiring, promoting, and acting as a bridge. In the mass movement, the youth movement occupies the main and active position in the mass movement. Therefore, if we want to strive for final victory, we must strengthen the youth movement even more. Isn't this clear? Our authorities are also very clear about this point. Each county universally launched the organization of the People's Anti-Japanese Support Association. The East River youth first responded to this call and prepared to establish Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Associations in various places. However, during this period, due to the long time since then, the organization was still very unsound, and many organizations did not have regular work performance, so they could not withstand greater blows. When the Japanese evil hand reached East River, some organizations even formed a state of disintegration, but this was a very short period.</p>
<p>The Japanese atrocities of burning, killing, raping, and plundering shattered their false policy of "benevolent rule." The Japanese weakness in Hui and Boluo, the inability of small units to operate independently, and the strong anti-war sentiment within the unit taught the East River compatriots, making them recognize the true face of the robbers, and recognize that "to survive is to resist Japan." Thus, revolutionary flames ignited anew everywhere in East River! The East River Youth Movement has also embarked on a new stage!</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Climax</p>
<p>The requirements of the objective situation and the development of the East River Youth Movement have become an inevitable product of history. First, the glorious banner was raised in Huiyang. The Huiyang youth began a desperate struggle with the Japanese. The youth of Boluo began a guerrilla attempt. At this time, the East River was the vanguard of South China - the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. This fresh force played a considerable role in the development of the East River Youth League. After arriving in East River, under the care, cultivation, and assistance of the government, they were successively sent to Heyuan, Xin'feng, Longmen, Longchuan, Zijin, Huibo, Haifeng, Lufeng and other places to work, helping the masses to organize mass anti-Japanese self-defense associations to launch mass movements, helping local youth to establish youth anti-Japanese organizations, and also organizing its own county and township teams, training hundreds of young cadres, and sowing the seeds of resistance in considerable numbers.</p>
<p>The most patriotic and most beloved overseas Chinese, especially the overseas Chinese in Guangdong, are even more united! They organized the Nanyang Hui Overseas Chinese Rescue Association rescue team to provide rice, surgery, medicine and cotton clothes to Huibo, and also organized the East River Service Group to work in various counties.</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese youth associations in various counties have also been especially consolidated and developed during this period, especially recently. Some places have even established unified organizations through unified actions. The focus of work has shifted from cities to rural areas, and the target of development has also shifted from intellectuals to workers and peasants. They are better able to transform from low-level organizations to high-level organizations, from scattered to concentrated, from partial to widespread. These are the advantages of the East River Youth League, and also the characteristics of the unprecedented climax. According to general statistics, more than 10,000 young people have been organized in the East River, which can be said to have established the foundation of the East River Youth Movement. Thousands of young people are fighting the Japanese on the front lines, and the remaining thousands are stepping up efforts in the rear to mobilize all forces to support the War of Resistance. These are all the achievements of the East River Youth Movement.</p>
<p>Weaknesses Manifest</p>
<p>Naturally, we still have many weaknesses. First of all, the scope of the organization is too small. We have been staying in the cities and circling around the intellectuals, so until now, we have only organized one percent of the one million young people in the East River, and this small organization is still very unsound, and leading cadres are still very lacking. Most are still young and have little experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, our work is still very superficial and cannot be in-depth or practical. The work style still suffers from the "leftist" closed-doorism problem, and cannot eliminate sectarianism, selfishness, and politicized styles. The united front style is still not done enough. In many places, we cannot get the government's specific and effective leadership. These are the biggest obstacles to the development of the East River Youth Movement.</p>
<p>Experiences and Lessons</p>
<p>1. All organizations must first obtain open and legal, sincere, and intentional support from the government and obtain the government's active leadership to develop easily. Naturally, it is best to pass the united front form in the organization. The direction of the organization should be placed on the vast number of unorganized youth, and various organizational forms suitable for the needs of the youth should be used to organize youth at all stages and in all departments.</p>
<p>2. Only by strengthening theoretical research can the large-scale development of the youth movement be guaranteed. In the past, due to insufficient political grasp, even less sufficient estimation of the war situation, failure to understand the theory and application of the united front, and even less understanding of the characteristics of the Guangdong environment and the specific environment of various places, the work could not be carried out well.</p>
<p>In short, the East River Youth Movement still has many weaknesses. The East River Youth Movement still cannot keep up with the requirements of the objective situation. Experience tells us that our organization is not strong enough, and cannot withstand the blows of war. We must accept the experiences and lessons of the world youth movement, the Chinese student movement, the youth movement; and the mass youth movement. We must come to a unified organization.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing the East River Youth United Front The Importance and Possibility of Establishing a United Front</p>
<p>Anyone who is not an orator but has political common sense will not deny the importance and possibility of establishing various united front organizations in China today, because unified front organizations achieve consistent cooperation in work, reduce waste of work and time, and at the same time, because Japanese spies, traitors, Trotskyites, and enemy agents are everywhere, the united front organization can reduce friction between groups, reduce opportunities for villains to sow discord, and also avoid loss of contact when comrades move around. It can also increase opportunities to jointly study the experiences and lessons of the youth movement to seek the development of the movement.</p>
<p>Facts have proven and are proving that due to the protracted nature of the War of Resistance and the long-term nature of nation-building, the long-term and inevitable nature of national unity is determined, and the possibility of establishing a youth movement united front is determined. The establishment of the China Federation of Students in the past and the establishment of youth movement united fronts in various places now are the best examples. Moreover, coupled with the recent attention, love, care, and cultivation of the youth movement by our authorities, Guangdong has a united front organization jointly established by eight groups—the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. The western and central regions have established a youth united front under the direct leadership of the county magistrates and party secretaries. The Longchuan County Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team of the East River has had rapid development under the direct leadership of the county magistrate, the party secretary, and the responsible team leader. The united front of five salvation groups in Heyuan County under the effective leadership of the party department has appeared in the form of a joint symposium. These are exemplary examples of the importance and possibility of establishing the East River Youth United Front.</p>
<p>How to Establish the East River Youth United Front?</p>
<p>1. Consolidate all existing anti-Japanese youth organizations. Organize unorganized youth on the basis of existing organizations, and broadly absorb youth to participate in organizations: strengthen various external organizations to surround the organization. Strengthen, enrich, and improve existing organizations to become schools for the masses, clubs, and powerful organizations to unite youth, and obtain the government's active leadership.</p>
<p>2. Promote the spirit of mutual assistance and concession between various groups. Link the youth movement with the mass movement, especially with the return movement and the children's movement, and use work to develop organizations, cultivate the most prestigious and socially influential central groups to help them overcome bureaucratism, spontaneous flow, closed-doorism, and all bad styles, so that they become models for unified organizations to promote other groups.</p>
<p>3. Establish a unified organization through unified action. Of course, unified action is from partial to expanded. First, in a county that does not yet have a unified organization, it should immediately use all opportunities to carry out a unified action. In the unified action, establish a unified organization. The same should be done between the various nearby counties that have already established a unified organization to establish a united front. From this, it should be expanded to the entire East River, so the establishment of the entire East River Youth United Front is long-term. We cannot allow it to develop spontaneously because it is long-term, but we should pay attention to this issue from today.</p>
<p>Strive to Establish a Model for the East River Youth United Front</p>
<p>We know that establishing the East River Youth United Front is not only possible but also necessary. Therefore, from today onwards, every one of our youth workers must strive to establish a model for the East River Youth United Front. We have the conditions to become a model for the united front. The Guangdong Youth Movement has many characteristics, one of which is that it appeared from the beginning in the form of a united front (the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team) and received the leadership and cultivation of the authorities from the beginning. Thus, it has played a model role for the united front in the Chinese Youth Movement. The East River Youth has a great revolutionary tradition, and the county magistrates and party secretaries of various counties love the youth movement, and there are quite a few counties such as Heyuan, Longchuan, Heping, Boluo, etc. that are actively leading the youth movement. In addition, the East River Youth Movement has a preliminary foundation. The number of youth we have organized is no less than that of the eastern, northern, and western regions of Guangdong. However, our rate of development is faster than in many places. Therefore, as long as every one of our youth workers is willing to make the greatest efforts to strive for a model of the East River Youth United Front, it is very likely that we will achieve a glorious victory in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Our Current Tasks and Guidelines</p>
<p>Our current overall task is: to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Guangdong, especially the revolutionary tradition of the East River Youth, to sincerely support the government, to help the government and the army, and under the clear leadership of the government, to mobilize and arm the vast number of youth to actively participate in the war, and to prepare to develop guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas behind enemy lines to defend our hometowns, defend the East River, and defend South China.</p>
<p>The first task and guideline is to insist on establishing the East River Youth United Front, to consolidate the connection between the government and the youth, and under the principle of not opposing this united front and not hindering the development of the united front, to use various forms to organize the vast number of unorganized youth. Establish a unified organization through a unified movement. The current problem is not whether youth can be organized, but whether the vast number of youth can be organized, whether the entire youth can be organized.</p>
<p>The second task and guideline is to mobilize and organize youth to participate in the war, to launch a youth movement, with youth stationed on the front lines, in the occupied areas, and behind enemy lines to launch and participate in guerrilla warfare, to intensify the study of military affairs and the use of weapons. Political workers should be militarized, with everything for the victory of the military. Mobilize youth to go to the army, participate in various accompanying service groups, and various military and political training classes, participate in conscription propaganda, universally launch a movement to treat the families of anti-Japanese soldiers preferentially, and establish a large number of semi-militarized and semi-armed youth organizations.</p>
<p>The third task and guideline is to thoroughly change the past "leftist", politicized, closed-door line of action, sectarian prejudices, bureaucratic leadership, and liberalistic problems. These styles are major obstacles to new development. Unless we change the way we do things, we cannot cope with the urgent objective situation. We should ask every young comrade to change the past style and adopt a new style. The new style is aimed at the current urgent situation of the War of Resistance, requiring the entire nation to strengthen unity, so it should be a style of united front, mutual assistance, mutual care, and consideration of the overall situation; a democratic, non-exclusive, youth-oriented, non-politicized style; and a hard-working, practical style. We should also especially strengthen cultural and recreational activities to meet the characteristics and requirements of the youth.</p>
<p>The fourth task and guideline is to develop the student movement. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the student movement has been transformed into a youth movement. After the fall of Guangzhou, the student movement in Guangdong has turned into a youth movement. The salvation movement no longer stays in the student realm, but turns from the student movement to the youth movement of all classes. This is a sign of progress, but we cannot therefore neglect the important position of the student movement in the youth movement. In the past few months, we have inevitably neglected it. Now, most primary and secondary schools have resumed operation, and the wartime middle school in Boluo is about to start classes, so we should pay attention to the student movement from today onwards. Of course, the student movement in the future will be different from the student movement in the past. We should require the authorities of each school to effectively implement wartime education, implement the resolutions of the National Education Conference, increase anti-Japanese theoretical teaching materials, both study and work at the same time, read books without forgetting to save the country, and establish a holistic student organization. Use various organizational forms to unite the comrades of the whole school, use the student movement to train a large number of anti-Japanese cadres, and use the student movement to develop the women's movement and the children's movement, and use the student movement to launch the wartime cultural movement in the countryside. Launch a movement to eliminate illiteracy. In the future, the student movement should become the force to mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to participate in the war. In the future, the student movement should be a student movement in which teachers and students are integrated. Not only should we pay attention to one school, but also to all schools, pay attention to the connection with the Chinese Student Union and the World Student Union, and not only pay attention to domestic anti-enemy propaganda, but also to propaganda to the world.</p>
<p>The fifth task and guideline is to improve the lives of young people. Everyone will admit that no one can support the War of Resistance with an empty stomach. At present, the lives of Chinese youth are too hard, and in the East River, the political offensive of the Japanese is added, buying off local bullies, contracting smuggling, contracting opium and gambling, collecting animal husbandry donations and taxes, robbing and extorting, and disrupting the countryside, making the lives of young people even more miserable, so improving the lives of young people and mobilizing young people to participate in the war are inseparable. The purpose of improving the lives of young people is to mobilize for the War of Resistance. Naturally, improving the lives of young people cannot be above all else and must be subordinate to the War of Resistance. If improving the lives of young people conflicts with the War of Resistance, the War of Resistance should be taken into consideration. In the countryside, we can use the united front to vigorously reduce rent and interest to improve the lives of young people, ask the government to provide relief to out-of-school and unemployed youth, organize and train them, prohibit beating and scolding of young workers and apprentices, ask the government for participation in politics, and reduce the statutory age for participation in politics.</p>
<p>Our current tasks and guidelines have been said, but these are only the opinions put forward by our small number of working comrades. We hope that every young working comrade, especially the young friends of the East River, will discuss, criticize, correct, and supplement them, so that we can all work hard to complete our tasks! Struggle to complete our tasks! Strive to establish a model for the East River Youth United Front, and use this to promote the united front of the Guangdong Youth Movement and influence the youth movement throughout the country. Work hard! The light is already in front of us.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Britain Values Our Southwest Development <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) The British firm, Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, recently held its 85th annual general meeting in London. Chairman Willis presented a detailed report, offering a very pertinent analysis of China's current situation, the prospects for economic construction, and the stability of currency and credit. He also expressed deep sympathy for China's arduous war of resistance. A New Voice News Agency reporter has translated the original text as follows: After reviewing the profit and loss statement, you will find that the net profit for this year (the current year) is £335,309, a decrease of nearly £150,000 compared to the previous year's £491,065. While this may not seem significant, I can point out that the £335,309 figure actually includes transfers from reserve accounts used to offset any discounts on government securities. I will now explain the unfavorable factors that led to the decline in profits. The volume of trade in all our business locations has decreased, but the deteriorating commercial situation in China and Japan has had an even greater impact on our relationship. Most of you, I believe, are closely observing the developments in these regions, so there is no need for me to elaborate. I would simply point out that the normal commerce for which we provided financing has been greatly disrupted over the past 18 months. If this is a temporary adjustment, or if we can return to a more normal situation in the near future, we would be delighted. What I am referring to is the implementation of the new currency in North China, which forces merchants to trade with the banks of the puppet regime and adopt the new currency (puppet currency). This is an ominous sign for the success of our future trade in China, especially in North China, and cannot be ignored. Secondly, the value of the government securities we hold has fallen sharply over the past two years. In past years, I have stated that these securities are mostly short-term, which does not allow us to be optimistic. In light of this, the board of directors decided to allocate earnings from this year to offset government securities at their current market price, and to make the necessary transfers from the reserve account, in addition to writing down unreliable and bad debts. The board of directors, the management, and myself are undoubtedly concerned about the reduction in dividends. However, under these circumstances, our conservative policy should be approved by you. I issued a warning last year, pointing out that business in China and Japan is difficult to profit from. You may not be surprised that the dividend distributed last September was reduced from 7% to 5%. You will find in our balance sheet of</p>
<p>The British Bank</p>
<p>a note stating that a contract has been signed to take over the British Bank from January 1, 1939. The head office of that bank is located in London, India, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, British Malaya, and China, with branches in various locations. The scope of its business, like ours, includes branches in the UK and these regions, or between these regions. With commerce expanding, both banks had much to manage, but since 1931, economic conditions have been unfavorable, and according to our assessment, there is little hope for improvement in the near future. After careful consideration for a long time, the board has decided to merge the bank's business into ours to reduce operating expenses and avoid inevitable competition. This proposal was decided last November. Since I reported to you last year, the situation in the Far East has greatly deteriorated from the perspective of British commerce and finance in China. The struggle between China and Japan has not stopped, the battle lines continue to lengthen, and after a year and a half of brutal warfare, the destruction is widespread, the economy is disrupted, and the hope of resolution remains distant. The central provinces have suffered severe destruction, and the population is dwindling. The once prosperous areas are no longer the tail end of international trade. The Yangtze River is no longer the pulse of trade, and the wholesale markets of Hankou and other ports have been closed. And since the fall of Guangzhou, virtually all of China's coast is under Japanese control. At that time, the Japanese are trying to create their political and economic monopoly in China, as they have done in Manchuria. Although our bank has significant interests in various parts of the Orient, the business of our branches in various ports in China constitutes the majority of our total business, which I need not remind you to pay attention to.</p>
<p>While international trade financing should not be biased towards the current war between the two major Eastern countries, on this occasion, it would be a lack of humanity not to express deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese, many of whom are friends of our bank. Although the current situation in China presents countless scenes of sorrow and chaos, a development is underway that fills China and the world with hope. Let me talk about the efforts to establish a new economic plan in the western provinces of China, and the migration to this undeveloped area with abundant natural resources. According to estimates, about several million Chinese, including merchants and professionals, have now moved to the western border areas. At first, the issue of properly settling these people and providing them with appropriate work seemed unsolvable, but due to the enthusiastic planning of responsible officials, I have no doubt that the Chinese people's adaptability and diligence will more than compensate for the losses caused by one of the greatest tragedies in history. Since the beginning of this century, Chinese friends have repeatedly expressed to the Chinese authorities the hope of opening up the wealthy western provinces, utilizing and building trade waterways, connecting Burma, to trade with various countries, but this has not been achieved. Due to military threats, China automatically seeks a raw material outlet through Burma and Siam. The construction of highways has made significant progress. This highway connects important cities of the Republic of China with Burma and the navigable points of the Irrawaddy River.</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>The situation has not changed much from what I saw a year ago, and is no different from what the general public knows. Foreign trade there was hit even harder in 1938 than in other parts of China. Regarding the consolidation of the Chinese currency, I discussed it a year ago. Due to the establishment of the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China in Tianjin, and the issuance of new "puppet" currency in North China, the Chinese government's restrictions on selling pounds sterling and other foreign currencies have been undermined. Although there has been a designated amount of foreign exchange in recent months, the exchange rate between Shanghai and London has fallen rapidly, from one shilling and two pence two five to eight pence. Since last June, the exchange rate has remained the same, with only moderate fluctuations in the market. Maintaining the stability of the Chinese currency is extremely important for British trade. On March 8, the Finance Minister announced the establishment of a currency stabilization fund of £10 million. Our bank, with the permission of the British Treasury to guarantee compensation for losses, participated in it. Its purpose is undoubtedly to be welcomed. It is important to note that this amount is not related to North China. This issue will cause the British, American, and French governments to lodge serious protests with Japan. As I said earlier, the Shanghai exchange rate has been able to maintain a relatively stable basis since last June, and external assistance has only been ordinary and intermittent. Although the situation still has some unstable elements, we have reason to hope that this stabilization fund will be effective. I have briefly reported to you the main reasons why the trade of our bank's various important branches has been affected. I would like to briefly mention one thing that I believe is quite relevant to future international trade, namely the Anglo-American Trade Agreement. I would like to call this agreement the Anglo-American Imperial Trade Agreement directly, because its provisions are not only about trade between the United States and Great Britain. This is an effort by the two major countries to improve the management of goods transactions and simplify them in order to encourage the development of trade and seek the actual benefits of all parties involved. Our government has given the Export Credits Guarantee Department greater power, so that it can provide extensive assistance to our country's export trade. I welcome this decision by the government very much. If the world situation can tend to be stable, then the improvement of world trade and the increase in raw material prices will also improve the living standards of the Eastern countries that we are very concerned about, which will inevitably be realized. The chairman's report and the 1938 accounts were unanimously approved by the attendees. The directors and auditors whose terms had expired were re-elected, and all expressed their gratitude to the chairman, directors, staff, and employees for their good work. A special general meeting was then held to present a plan to transfer the bank's charter to the attendees, which was also unanimously approved. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Enemy's Advance in Eastern Hubei Completely Failed; The Battle Situation North of Caijiahe Turns Quiet; Fierce Fighting for the Outskirts of Nanchang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 9th) (Late Arrival) The current war situation is stable. Although the enemy is mobilizing in various war zones, it is purely a matter of shifting from east to west to fill gaps, putting on a false show of strength, and there is no major offensive force. In the Jiangxi area, our troops are engaged in a seesaw battle near Niuxing Station, Shengmi Street, and Xiangtang. There are no major battles in the Guangdong area. In central Hubei, the enemy's repeated attacks on areas north of Caijiahe have been repelled, and the situation has now turned quiet. In the Anhui area, our forces have captured Quanjiao.</p>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 10th) Yesterday, a spokesman for the Chinese military authorities told reporters that there were no changes on any front. The Japanese army in Guangdong totals about three divisions, and there are about four divisions of the Japanese army south of the Yangtze River in central China, and four divisions north of Hankou. There are no fierce battles near Nanchang, but the Chinese army is constantly attacking the Japanese army to prevent them from launching a large-scale offensive. The Chinese army is now watching the movements of the Japanese army and attacking their weaknesses. The Japanese army in central China has suffered too many losses in the past few weeks and has had to ask Nanjing for reinforcements. Although the Chinese army in Jiangsu has recovered Shenshui, it is advancing towards Yixing. The spokesman also said that the activities of the Chinese army do not have any major objectives, but they are sufficient to restrain the Japanese army. Although the Japanese army in Shanxi has a total of four divisions and is constantly reinforcing, it still cannot maintain railway and highway traffic, and is often destroyed by Chinese guerrillas at night. Finally, the spokesman said that judging from the Chinese army's battle record in recent weeks, it can be seen that the Chinese army's strategy is to avoid decisive battles with the Japanese army in order to let them destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles in Suizao for Days</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanyang, 9th) The enemy east of Tongbai, Wujiadian, and Donglin Store is advancing towards us along the right flank of the highway. After we fiercely fired with artillery and machine guns, the enemy retreated in panic. Another guerrilla unit of ours has launched a surprise attack on the rear of Wujiadian. The enemy is currently continuing to shell us in areas such as Gujia, Dashan, and Yangshan Temple. We have suffered little damage. Fierce battles have been fought in the Suizao area for days. After suffering a new defeat, the enemy has advanced again. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. A cavalry unit of the enemy has been discovered southwest of Zhaoyang and around Qisi Temple and Jiyangpu. We have dispatched troops to suppress them and a fierce battle has broken out. On the 9th, enemy aircraft bombed a certain area in the southeast of Nanyang in batches, and dropped bombs in places such as Litou Town. While the reporter was sending a report from the city, three enemy aircraft flew low and dropped bombs at 3:15 p.m. Bombs fell on schools such as the Women's Primary School and the Women's Vocational School. Two bombs also fell in the Republican Daily News Building.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 9th) Our army once recovered Xianning on the 7th. Due to communication obstacles, the good news has only just arrived today. After our army captured Xianning Station on the 20th of last month, it continued to attack the city. Progress was made smoothly for days, and the city was finally captured on the 7th. After our fierce attack, the enemy suffered more than 600 casualties. We captured two machine guns and fifty-eight rifles, and burned all the enemy's ammunition and supplies. Subsequently, enemy troops came to reinforce from Puqi and Heqiao. Our army fought bravely and launched another attack, again inflicting casualties on the enemy. After the task of consuming the enemy's forces was completed, we defended the high ground outside the city and waited for an opportunity to launch another attack.</p>
<p>Niuxing Once Captured</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 9th) On the evening of the 7th, a unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Niuxing. After fighting until dawn, they finally occupied Niuxing, killing more than 100 enemy troops and capturing two machine guns and thirty rifles. On the morning of the 8th, the enemy increased their forces from Nanchang and launched a counterattack on Niuxing. The battle lasted all day. Our only goal was to harass the enemy and we moved to the west of Niuxing to confront the enemy.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanggao, 9th) In the battle north of Jing'an on the evening of the 7th, our army captured a Japanese logistics officer, Captain Uemura, who has now been sent to a certain prisoner of war camp. Uemura is very grateful for our preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Yicheng, 9th) On the morning of the 9th, we once again recovered Chitu Street, northeast of Gao'an, and launched an attack to the east of the highway, encircling the enemy in Qiuling. Fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements to Guangzhou</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Somewhere, 9th) Late on the 8th, a large number of Japanese warships were discovered sailing west off Beihai. It is reported that they were carrying reinforcements from Taiwan to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Shanghai, 10th) It has just been reported here that a squadron of Chinese aircraft attacked Sanshui yesterday, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army there, and bombed three Japanese warships, all of which were reported to have been hit. They then returned safely to their defense.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shaoguan, 9th) Three enemy aircraft attacked the counties of Qingyuan, Yingde, and Longmen in batches, dropping five bombs, killing and injuring three civilians.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th) Foreign news, according to extremely reliable sources, the Japanese army in Guangzhou announced martial law at the beginning of this month because Chinese guerrillas attacked Guangzhou. An employee of the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Taiwan told reporters today that a guerrilla unit of 100 people entered the bank last Sunday and killed three Japanese guards with bayonets. The guerrillas left the bank twenty minutes later, and the Japanese side only discovered it then. They immediately ordered martial law and conducted a strict search in the city. The result was that they claimed to have arrested several suspects, but according to Chinese reports, the arrested people were not members of the guerrilla unit. It is believed that the purpose of a unit of the Japanese army heading north to the Liaohan Road area yesterday was obviously to defend against attacks by guerrillas.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Port) According to those who came to Hong Kong from Xiamen, a Japanese aircraft carrier is currently docked in Xiamen, facing the sea. Many Japanese aircraft take off from the ship to bomb our army near Xiamen, which proves that the momentum of our army in the area is extremely great.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Shanghai, 10th) A spokesman for the Japanese Navy here told reporters at a press conference today in response to inquiries that Chinese guerrillas near Xiamen have indeed been very active recently. The Japanese army has now sent aircraft to disperse the Chinese guerrillas concentrated along the coast.</p>
<p>Main Force of the Shanxi Enemy Moves West</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tangqu, 9th) After the enemy in central Shanxi sneaked into the northern section of the Baijin Highway and was defeated by us, their main force seems to have been transferred to western Shanxi, and a part of them has been sent south as reinforcements. They have recently been forcibly conscripting civilian laborers to repair the Jieshi Resistance Center.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Yuci, 9th) The Pinghan Railway has been destroyed by us, with 340 meters of tracks broken, and traffic between Huanbao has been interrupted as a result. Our attacking troops have also been advancing and operating near Suibao, causing the enemy to feel threatened. Now more than 1,500 people have been sent west as reinforcements.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Luoyang, 9th) After our army in northern Henan recovered Meng County and Qiyuan, the front lines have become quite solid. In the battles of Taiping Village (northwest of Qinyang) and Daziling (northwest of Bo'ai), our army successively annihilated 800 enemy troops, inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, and the morale is extremely high. Our army is still constantly attacking and cutting off the enemy's communications.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th) Because our army has recently launched offensives on various fronts and won successive victories, four members of the British House of Lords and thirty-two members of the House of Commons jointly sent a cable to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a few days ago to express their congratulations and specifically pointed out that any peace treaty established by democratic countries must be participated in by our country (translation seen in this newspaper on the 8th).

<p>(News from this Port) The British aviation industry in China has always ranked first, but since the outbreak of the war, most of our coastal lines have fallen, and the Japanese have blockaded the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, not allowing foreigners to interfere. As a result, the situation has suddenly changed, and the Japanese aviation industry in China, under the threat of violence, has risen to the first place. Britain has fallen to second place. The following is a table of the entry and exit of ships and tonnage of various countries based on customs records:</p>

<p>(News from this Port) Three Norwegian ships, Xinglong, Dahuai, and Xinsheng, were previously seized by enemy warships in the waters of Shantou and Fuzhou. According to news from aviation circles, it has been confirmed that these three ships have been taken to Hecun. Although the Norwegian diplomatic authorities in Japan have protested, the enemy has not returned the three ships. As for the British ship "West Caddis", it is still being detained in Taiwan. The enemy claims that the ship was transporting war food, so despite protests from the British side, it has not been released. The enemy's actions harm the interests of third countries, and foreign businessmen are extremely angry. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China has decided to provide strict protection for British ships sailing along the Chinese coast to avoid interference from the enemy. It is said that British merchants have asked the British government to take a tough stance.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Second Phase of War History Opens a Glorious Page: Victories on the East Bank of the Xiang River. Failure of × Two Divisions to Invade Jingzhou and Shashi. Our Zhang and Feng Armies Annihilate × Six to Seven Thousand <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Nanzhang Correspondence] From mid-February to early March, our certain group army, the Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhian armies, fought with × in the Zhongxiang area on the east bank of the Xiang River. After a heroic struggle, they repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on ×. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>× Army's Intentions: Since mid-February, × 16th Division Commander, Fujita Megumu, after occupying Tianmen, has been actively reinforcing troops in the Jingshan Zaoshi area, launching successive westward offensives. The combat troops consisted of the entire 16th Division, part of the 19th Division, and attached special forces, plus the 7th Route of the puppet Mongolian army under Ha Tongshu, with a total strength of approximately 25,000 men. On the 22nd, they launched a full-scale offensive in three directions against our army's defense lines on the Hanyi, Jingzhong highways, and the left bank of the Xiang River at Sanyangdian. Their intention was to cross the Xiang River, go straight to Jingzhou and Shashi, to cut off our north-south transportation, threaten Nanchang, and alleviate any worries about the west. They also hoped to cross the Yangtze River from Shashi and attack northern Hunan. Their ambition can be said to be great. However, it was the Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhian armies that shattered ×'s dream. The two armies commanded six divisions, not including special forces. All officers and soldiers were brave men from Yan and Zhao, and their strength was not to be underestimated. They were indeed a formidable force in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Along the Hanyi Road: On the morning of February 25th, × infantry and cavalry, totaling six to seven hundred with eight artillery pieces, broke through the position of our certain unit at Wamiaoji and advanced towards the forward position of a certain division at Yiheji. At that time, there was only one company of soldiers from a certain regiment of that division defending the area. With extremely limited forces, they faced the arrogant enemy and engaged in a bloody battle, suffering almost complete casualties. Fortunately, reinforcements arrived that evening, and Yiheji was finally stabilized on the morning of the following day, after alternating between loss and gain.</p>
<p>On the same day, while the Japanese army was attacking Yiheji, they also launched a fierce attack with about five to six hundred men and four artillery pieces against the position of our certain regiment at Qilinkou. After repeated battles and fierce fighting all day long, the Japanese were ultimately unsuccessful due to the steadfast resistance of the defending soldiers. However, a certain military vehicle depot at Yanmenkou, an important stronghold, was in a very precarious situation due to the large-scale Japanese offensive. A certain regiment of our army, in order to coordinate with friendly forces, dispatched Wei Battalion to provide support despite its own difficult situation. After a day of fierce and bloody fighting, Battalion Commander Wei Qingqiao was wounded, and only about thirty men returned, while the rest had made heroic sacrifices. At Qilinkou, as a result of mutual attacks with the Japanese army, five to six hundred mechanized Japanese soldiers were indeed annihilated. However, the brave and loyal soldiers of that regiment also suffered similar casualties.</p>
<p>× advanced from Yanmen, went straight to Yonglong River, and engaged in a fierce battle with a certain army at Yangjialong on the 27th. Its main force, consisting of more than two thousand men and more than ten artillery pieces, turned north, threatening the rear of our army. Our army often used its main force to defend the main position at Lishu Ridge and extended westward and eastward to Xia Yang Hong as the east-west line. In addition, a certain brigade of a certain division was dispatched to Xia Yang Port and Sikou to attack the flank of the × army. At this time, the × army reinforced with more than two thousand men and more than ten artillery pieces, changed its plan, and launched a fierce attack, using aircraft and artillery as cover, making rapid advances. A bloody battle unfolded in the area of Tanjiaqiao and Hejiaji. Battalion Commander Zhang Yuliang was wounded, and Battalion Adjutant Li Chunxia was seriously wounded. Although the remaining officers and soldiers fought desperately to blunt the enemy's advance, they were ultimately unable to withstand the power of machinery with their flesh and blood. On the 28th, amid heavy sacrifices and heroic songs, they had to slightly shift their positions. There were many memorable events in this battle. First, a certain battalion of a certain regiment attacked the headquarters of the × army in Taiheji. Just as they were breaking through the outer defenses and preparing to capture ×, reinforcements from the × army arrived, and they turned back amid the victorious shouts of killing more than eighty Japanese soldiers and seizing dozens of machine guns and rifles. Second, a certain regiment attacked the × army west of Yanmenkou Liujiaji, destroying more than ten × armored vehicles and killing forty or fifty × soldiers. Third, a certain brigade engaged in positional warfare with the × army, inflicting repeated heavy blows. The × army suffered heavy losses. Our army did suffer six to seven hundred casualties, but the × army used thirty-seven fully loaded trucks to transport corpses from Yanmenkou Yangjia back to Zaoshi, which were then cremated and sent back to their home country.</p>
<p>On the Jingzhong Line: At noon on February 22nd, the Koga Brigade of the Japanese army, consisting of about five thousand men with twenty-odd artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack in three directions against the Huafang Sunqiao position. A certain division of our army responded calmly, and the Japanese army was unsuccessful. At the same time, five to six hundred Japanese soldiers in the Sanyangdian area launched a fierce attack on the Huajun position at Sanyangdian. A part of a certain division of our army engaged in a fierce battle with ×, killing more than two hundred × soldiers. × reinforcements arrived and attacked Luohanling with a part of their forces. Our army, because the communication line was cut off, withdrew to the west of Sanyangdian to engage in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>The × army attacking Sunqiao suffered heavy casualties at Lujialing by a certain division of the Huajun, and many backpacks, coats, documents, and military supplies were seized. February 28th, from morning to night, was particularly heroic. A certain commander of the Huajun shed blood and fought bravely, advancing wave after wave. The Japanese army also suffered numerous casualties, with corpses piled upon corpses. The × army's offensive suffered setbacks, and they dispatched powerful units to encircle our left flank and attack the front of Guanqiao. A certain division of our army endured hardship and suffered heavy casualties. Finally, amid tragic cries, they abandoned Sunqiao and transferred to Gongqiao to engage in a bloody battle with the × army. × exhausted its strength for seven consecutive nights, sacrificing more than three thousand men before finally taking Sunqiao. A certain division of our army failed to repel the × army, but the heavy casualties suffered by × were enough to break their morale. When the × on the Hanyi Road transferred forces from Xiaokou in an attempt to encircle Xiang de, from March 1st, the fighting on the Jingzhong Road became even more fierce. × launched a fierce attack on the Guanqiao position with its main force, and also used two units to encircle the left and right flanks, threatening . Qiao, and concentrated the firepower of more than forty artillery pieces, together with × aircraft, to bomb in formation, round after round, until our positions were leveled. × also released a large amount of poison gas, creating a tragic positional warfare situation, but the fearless division commander was still directing the battle on the front line, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the × army, suffering considerable casualties, and fighting back and forth five or six times. In addition, more than a thousand × soldiers who had joined forces from Liufangzui closely engaged in a bloody battle with a certain division of our army and Bai Qiyun's troops in the area east of Changshoudian. At this time, a certain division of our army and a certain brigade of a certain division were ordered to provide support and attack Dongqiao on the flank. But on the evening of the 2nd, just as they arrived at. Port, the Japanese army from Jiaji and other places launched a two-pronged attack with more than two thousand infantry and cavalry and eight artillery pieces, launching a second bloody battle at dawn on the 3rd.</p>
<p>During the mixed battle in Dongqiao, another seven or eight hundred × soldiers with four artillery pieces launched a fierce attack on the Second Battalion of a certain division of our army at Jiukou. After a day-long bloody battle, due to the intense firepower of ×, Company Commander Han of the Second Company of the battalion was killed in action, and the entire company also made a tragic sacrifice.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd, a certain division encountered × in Xinjie and fought hard all night, hoping to sustain the critical situation. A certain brigade also engaged in fierce fighting with the superior × for days, suffering particularly heavy casualties, and were ordered to transfer their positions. At this time, the battle had reached its most intense stage, and × had also approached the county seat of Zhongxiang.</p>
<p>The Bloody Battle of Zhongxiang: On the morning of the 4th, × launched a fierce attack on Zhongxiang in separate directions, one advancing rapidly towards the city from Da Kai Lake, and the other attacking westward from the Jingzhong Road. At the same time, the Japanese army at Liufangzui Wangjiadian also approached the northeast of the city. The main force of a certain division of our army then engaged in a frontal conflict with ×. The people in the city, in the pouring rain, supported the old and carried the young, and retreated north. Although the road was muddy, everyone was filled with tears as they left their ancestral home in the mud. In order not to be subjugated people, they had no choice but to temporarily leave their hometown.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, × had already pressed close to the city gate. A certain division and a part of a certain division engaged in a tragic street battle with ×. The × army, which charged in several times, was ruthlessly cut down, achieving the task of attrition. However, the continuous attacks of the × army's mechanized weapons made it impossible for us to alleviate its predicament. Finally, at nine o'clock in the morning, the ancient county seat, which had been repeatedly bombed by × aircraft into a pile of rubble, was declared abandoned.</p>
<p>Although Zhongxiang is a pile of rubble and useless, this tragic and bloody battle will be permanently engraved in people's minds and will also occupy the first glorious page in the history of the second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>After the Battle: According to the × army's own report, the × army suffered six to seven thousand casualties in this fierce battle (I think it was even more). They were exhausted and unable to attack again. It can be said that after the Battle of Wuhan, the × army was stopped dead in its tracks. The material losses of the × army included more than forty machine guns and rifles seized by our army, more than ten armored vehicles destroyed, and more than one hundred important documents, military supplies, backpacks, and coats. There were also many other items. Although our army suffered considerable sacrifices, in the great era of national war, it is not worth worrying about. At present, the situation is that the × army has gathered 20,000 men at the various crossings on the east bank of the Xiang River, causing disturbances along the river, firing artillery, and preparing bridging materials, trying to cross the river by stealth. Their focus is on Shayang. A certain group army has joined forces with friendly forces to make strict deployments to strike them again. Therefore, since last month, the × army has not dared to cross the line. Let us look at the initial progress of the × army, and then at how it took half a year to obtain a dead city. Although their weapons and equipment are superior to those of the Chinese army, in this battle, the comparison of the casualties of the two armies can be said to be equal, setting a new record since the beginning of the war.

After the bank's establishment, it decided to issue counterfeit currency. According to the Japanese side, foreign banks have agreed to accept this counterfeit currency. However, the truth is worth investigating. As for the puppet government's various agencies, they will naturally use this counterfeit currency, but the Shanghai Customs has decided to refuse to accept it. The original Japanese plan was to exchange goods from the occupied areas for the counterfeit currency, then exchange it for legal tender, and then use the legal tender to purchase foreign exchange. However, in reality, except for the cities, the countryside in the occupied areas is still controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Not only is it impossible to use counterfeit currency, but it is also dangerous to hide it. Farmers are unwilling and dare not sell their goods for counterfeit currency under coercion. As for the members of the Banking Industry Association, they have also decided to refuse to accept this counterfeit currency. Therefore, the entire Shanghai financial market will not suffer a major impact.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Dalu Bao reported that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, when answering questions at a reception for reporters on April 1st, vaguely hinted at restricting trade in Shanghai in order to support the paper money to be issued by the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which opened in Hongkou yesterday. He refused to make any statements about the possibility of merchants being forced to obtain export permits from this bank or banks under Japanese control, which implied that restrictions might be implemented. According to a statement issued by the Allied News Agency yesterday, the Huaxing Commercial Bank has a capital of "50 million yuan" and is established in accordance with the laws of the "Reformed Government." It will issue paper money that can be freely exchanged for foreign currency.</p>
<p>The last few words caused the reporters to question the consul repeatedly. The consul replied to the initial question, saying that the Huaxing Commercial Bank would sell foreign exchange without restriction at the same price as the Chinese legal tender, with the paper money issued by this bank. The reporter asked, "What is the source of this large amount of foreign exchange? Can it be stated? Will it be obtained from the customs through export permits? If the bank can supply foreign exchange without restriction, then it must be able to obtain an unlimited quantity." The spokesperson said, "There is no intention to impose such restrictions at present." Someone asked, based on this answer, if the public does not handle export documents through this bank but automatically supports it, will the Japanese authorities implement restrictions similar to those currently in place in North China? The spokesperson replied, "Given our position, we cannot discuss future matters at present."</p>
<p>Someone asked if the Huaxing Commercial Bank could establish credit and loan facilities in London and New York. The consul stated that he refused to answer this question. Someone asked whether the proposed paper money was backed by foreign currency or legal tender, or whether its capital was merely recorded on the books and had no substance. The consul replied that the paper money would be issued with legal tender as capital and accepted at par. A reporter mentioned the statement issued by Chen Jintao, the pseudo-"Finance Minister of the Reformed Government," who had been nominated as the president of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, and asked, "Does the spokesperson also believe that the legal tender in Nanjing is currently facing a crisis? What will happen if the legal tender depreciates?" The consul stated, "The unsoundness of the legal tender is a fact recognized by everyone." However, he then admitted that he would accept the proposed paper money at par with the legal tender.</p>
<p>The spokesperson believed that the regulations of third-country banks would not hinder the new currency and replied that several foreign banks had agreed to handle the new currency. Someone asked if they could name these foreign banks. The consul said that the list was not yet complete and that he did not want to name them at present. According to a report issued by the Allied News Agency yesterday, the Huaxing Commercial Bank held its inaugural meeting at the New Asia Hotel. Chen Jintao was elected as the bank's president, and Isoichi Washio, the former director of the "Central Bank" of Manchuria in Changchun, was elected as the vice president. The bank's capital will be "fully paid up" with 25 million yuan contributed by the "Reformed Government" and the remaining amount contributed by Japanese banks. It was also said that the bank's paper money would become the legal currency in the occupied areas, and formal payments and bank transactions would be accepted, with the only exception being that it could not be used to pay customs duties. However, according to Chen's declaration, this restriction on the use of the new currency was of a "temporary" nature. The Japanese consul hinted at a reception for reporters yesterday that the paper money issued by the "New Bank" had strong backing, but there were clearly some doubts. The consul also stated that the new currency was backed by legal tender, while Chen's declaration stated that the future of the legal tender was "unpredictable."</p>

<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 10th] Regarding the interference by the authorities of the Shanghai French Concession and the Public Concession with the freedom of Chinese residents in the area to display the national flag, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged protests with the British, French, and American embassies in China, stating the importance our government attaches to this matter and requesting that they instruct the concession authorities to refrain from interfering with the freedom of residents in the area to display the flag in the future. Subsequently, the British and French embassies replied, explaining their difficult position on the concession issue and stating that the concession authorities intended to stipulate the following eight days of each year for displaying the flag: January 1st, March 12th, March 29th, May 5th, July 1st, August 27th, October 10th, and November 12th. The Foreign Ministry believes that this measure cannot resolve the matter and has made oral and written statements to the ambassadors of the respective countries, requesting that they instruct the concessions to respect the freedom of residents in the area to display the flag. Furthermore, regarding the suppression of freedom of speech in the Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, the Foreign Ministry has also lodged protests with the British embassy, requesting rectification.</p>

<h3 id="e14">British-Soviet Negotiations Remain Deadlocked. The Soviet Union Publishes the Content of British Counter-proposals. Chamberlain Will Explain the Progress of the Negotiations. <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Moscow Associated Press, 10th] According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Union has definitely rejected the British counter-proposal. The Soviet side said that the British proposal did not mention whether Britain and France would provide military assistance to the Soviet Union if it was drawn into war because of assisting Poland and Romania. The Soviet government has just published an official gazette stating that Britain is demanding that the Soviet Union provide immediate military assistance if Britain and France are drawn into war because of supporting Poland and Romania.</p>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 10th] Moscow TASS, 10th. According to news from London, Reuters has broadcast a report, the gist of which is that the British government's response to the Soviet Union's proposal contains the following basic counter-proposals: First, the Soviet Union must individually provide guarantees to its neighboring countries. Second, if the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex of war as a result of fulfilling this guarantee, then Britain will assist the Soviet Union. According to information obtained from authoritative Soviet sources, TASS must solemnly declare that this report by Reuters is not entirely consistent with the facts. The Soviet government actually received the British government's counter-proposal only on the 8th of this month. The French government has not raised any objections to the proposal either. The proposed cases do not mention that the Soviet government must individually provide guarantees to its neighboring countries. It only states that if Britain and France fulfill their obligations to Poland and Romania, resulting in military action, the Soviet government must immediately provide assistance. However, the British government's counter-proposal also does not mention that if the Soviet Union is fulfilling its obligations to certain countries in Eastern Europe, similarly resulting in military action, the Soviet government should also receive assistance from Britain and France on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>[London Haitong News Agency, 10th] It has been announced here that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce the situation regarding the Moscow negotiations in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. Although it is currently impossible to predict the content of the announcement, according to well-informed sources, the semi-official declaration issued by the Soviet News Agency on Tuesday evening was due to a misunderstanding, and the British Prime Minister will provide a detailed explanation at that time.</p>
<p>[London Reuters, 10th] The "News Chronicle's" diplomatic correspondent, Barrett, declared today that the Soviet Union's communiqué regarding the British proposal has caused considerable unease here. Barrett also said that the British government has not asked the Soviet Union to cooperate in jointly defending the borders of Britain and France. However, what the Soviet communiqué expresses is the Soviet Union's firm position, demanding that an agreement be signed with Britain and France that includes all of Europe, and not just the countries that Britain had previously proposed to protect. It is believed here that the British counter-proposal is only a proposal or observation, and the door to further negotiations has not yet been closed.</p>
<p>[London Reuters, 9th] It is learned that the British ambassador to the Soviet Union and Molotov had a very cordial conversation. The Soviet Foreign Minister needs to have sufficient time to consider the British proposal. There is currently no reason to assume that the basic points of Soviet foreign policy have changed.</p>
<p>[London Central News Agency, 9th] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, Soviet figures here recently declared that the Soviet government would propose at least two conditions for the new British proposal: (1) After the Soviet Union accepts the commitment, the countries concerned should negotiate military cooperation methods. (2) The guarantees provided by the countries concerned should be extended to the Baltic states. Those close to the British government said that regarding the second item, it is not impossible for the staff of the countries concerned to conduct talks. Regarding the first item, it is not something that Britain can decide alone. In any case, it can be asserted that the British-Soviet negotiations will be protracted.</p>
<p>[London Central News Agency, 10th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky recently informed Foreign Secretary Halifax that Romania is prepared to accept the Soviet Union's guarantee as part of establishing an Eastern European security system. This proposal was first initiated by the Romanian side.</p>
<p>[Moscow Central News Agency, 9th] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, British Ambassador Sir Seeds presented the new proposal to Foreign People's Commissar Molotov. They are now awaiting the Soviet government to submit a reply. Molotov held talks with Polish Ambassador Grzybowski yesterday. This level is valued by the general public, who say that Soviet-Polish relations have improved in accordance with British wishes. There are three pieces of evidence for this: (1) The Soviet government has appointed Kharlamov as ambassador to Poland, (2) Foreign People's Deputy Commissar Potemkin has visited Poland, and (3) There is a saying that the Soviet government will appoint a minister to Romania. As for the rumor from London that the Soviet Union has agreed to provide guarantees to its neighbors, namely Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states, well-informed sources here recently denied it.</p>
<p>[London Central News Agency, 9th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and held talks on the organization of an anti-aggression group. Officials here then declared that the talks were extremely cordial. The new counter-proposal made by British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds to the Soviet Foreign Affairs Personnel Committee yesterday was based on the assertion that if Britain and France were drawn into a war by assisting Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union should immediately provide assistance at the request of Britain and France. Sir Seeds also explained to Molotov that in the event of a crisis, Britain and France would first fulfill their commitments to the Baltic states and would never stand idly by, allowing the Soviet Union to assist those countries alone. Foreign Secretary Halifax also reiterated this intention when he received Soviet Ambassador Maisky today. The foreign policy will not change due to the departure of the former Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Pope's Peace Proposal Meets With Indifference From Various Countries; Vatican Denies Any Plan <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Vatican City, 9th] The Pope's proposal to convene a five-power conference has not been welcomed by various parties, and therefore, there is a trend of abandoning it today. This is because Poland is unwilling to enter "another Munich," France seems to have decided not to participate in the mediation of the Italian dispute, and Britain is also unwilling to participate in these negotiations, as they may put pressure on Britain to exert pressure on its allies. Germany and Italy have expressed suspicion about the invitation to convene this conference, fearing that they would be outnumbered in it.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 10th] Yesterday, authorities here announced, denying the outside rumors that the Pope was planning to mediate the conflict between Germany and Poland, but said that the Pope really wanted to maintain peace through diplomatic means. However, well-informed sources said that the Vatican originally had this plan, but it has now been abandoned, and the Pope is now trying to help France and Italy reach an understanding and is currently negotiating with both parties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 9th] There are widespread rumors that the Pope may convene a conference to resolve the German-Polish dispute. Sources in the Holy See said that this cannot be fully believed. The Pope cares about peace but still advocates starting from ordinary diplomatic channels. Therefore, Vatican representatives stationed in various countries have contacted heads of government and foreign ministers in the past few days to express the Pope's deep desire, because the Pope believes that peace can be achieved through mutual understanding, and problems between countries can also be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Archbishop Godfrey, the Vatican representative in London, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday and reportedly suggested, in the name of the Pope, convening a conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to find a solution to the Danzig issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The Vatican representative in Britain met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax over the weekend for talks. No official statement has been released yet, but it is generally believed that it was to discuss the Danzig issue. It is reported that the Pope has suggested holding a European conference in the hope of resolving the Danzig dispute.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] It is reported that the Pope is now working hard to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to hold a conference in the hope of resolving the Danzig and Mediterranean issues. Negotiations are currently underway in the capitals of various countries. It is said that the Vatican is providing great assistance to the Pope in this effort.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th] Regarding the German-Polish dispute, after Archbishop Orsenigo, the Vatican representative in Germany, recently appealed to the German government for peace, well-informed sources here declared that the German government has responded, saying that Pope Pius XII's statement has noble moral objectives, and Germany will naturally consider it with a sympathetic attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] After news was released that the Pope was actively working in the capitals of various countries, calling for a peaceful resolution to the German-Polish dispute, newspapers here discussed it unanimously today. "L'Humanité" and "Le Populaire" indicated that this move was quite contrary to Poland's territorial independence, while "Le Temps" and "L'Intransigeant" believed that there was no urgent need for such mediation at present. Authoritative sources declared that the Pope has not yet put forward concrete proposals, so the newspapers have not discussed the five-power conference issue.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Mr. Longer asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons today whether the British government's guarantee against aggression to France had been conveyed through diplomatic channels and whether the Prime Minister had received a reply from Germany. Chamberlain replied, "The British government is prepared to consider exchanging guarantees with the German government, but has not yet submitted guarantees to Germany through diplomatic channels, nor has it received any opinions from the German government on this matter." The Prime Minister also said that he hoped to release a report on the British-Turkish negotiations soon. Then, Henderson asked whether the government's delay in reporting on the progress of these negotiations was intended to wait until the British-Soviet negotiations were completed before submitting the report. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied "No."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 9th] Mussolini said in a speech at the "Army Day" conference today, "Our strength is extremely powerful, but our determination is even stronger. If anything happens, it can be proven by facts." King Emmanuel inspected the troops today, with 20,000 participants, 1,200 generals, 1,300 horses, 1,000 motorcycles, 700 machine guns, 300 cannons, and 300 armored vehicles.

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to Munich from Italy today. He spent most of the afternoon reporting to Hitler on his discussions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Although Ribbentrop had made lengthy inquiries to Hitler by telephone at least once during his talks with Ciano, Hitler still had many matters he wanted to discuss with Ribbentrop in person, especially wanting to know the reactions of various countries to the German-Italian military alliance. The reports sent by German ambassadors and ministers in foreign countries, including those stationed in countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, are being closely studied by the German government.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The British Prime Minister announced in the House of Commons today that the Military Training Act and the Reserve Supplementary Force Act will both become law before Whitsun (the seventh Sunday after Easter).</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] British War Minister Hore-Belisha presented the second reading of the Reserve Supplementary Force Act in the House of Commons today, explaining the current mobilization steps. He continued, "We are in a state of continuous tension. War will break out suddenly, without any prior warning. Most countries in Europe are maintaining their troops in various states of mobilization. However, our country's legal procedures are extremely cumbersome, which will inevitably make our national defense preparations as public as possible, and the serious words such as 'national crisis' and 'emergency period' stipulated in the provisions are easy to cause misunderstandings and internal unrest among foreigners. The purpose of this bill is to eliminate these drawbacks." He also said that previously, the reserve force only received twelve days of training per year, which was too little, resulting in unfamiliarity with new weapons. In the future, the training time should be extended, to no more than three months per year. In this way, the reserve force can join the battle after being notified a short time ago. It is planned to call up the reserve force for training one month after the bill is passed. Then, opposition Labour members such as Mr. Lawson rose to speak, and the bill was passed for the second reading.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Swedish Capital, 9th] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland met in the Swedish capital and have decided to reject the non-aggression pact offered by Germany. Hitler had separately requested each of these countries to conclude a unilateral non-aggression pact with Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Swedish Capital, 9th] The four Nordic countries Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland jointly issued a communiqué today stating: "The foreign ministers of the four countries hereby declare that the Nordic countries have decided to maintain the declaration issued in Oslo last year, to avoid involvement in any European group. If a war occurs between these groups, the Nordic countries will especially try to avoid being involved in the vortex of war."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Swedish Capital, 9th] The Nordic countries have recently rejected Hitler's proposal with humility and politeness. This attitude was decided by the foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries after their recent meeting here. The governments of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland will formally reply to Hitler separately. It is hoped and believed that although the replies of the four countries will not be exactly the same, they will unanimously express their gratitude to Hitler for his proposal, but solemnly declare that they have no intention of getting involved in any political group. However, Denmark, because of its border with Germany, may propose other cooperation methods to appease Hitler.</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Problem of Spiritual Food <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The need to promote cultural movements is becoming increasingly urgent with the expansion of the spiritual mobilization, and the issue of cultural food or spiritual food is becoming serious. This is the case domestically, and even more so among overseas Chinese in various places.</p>
<p>Although the population of this port reaches hundreds of thousands, the number of libraries providing cultural and spiritual food is only a few, among which the one that can truly open to the public and provide practical benefits to the middle and lower overseas Chinese is the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library. Recently, someone in the newspaper suggested discontinuing it. This news must be surprising. We hope it does not become a reality. On the contrary, we sincerely hope that social leaders will work together to provide economic or spiritual assistance to enable it to achieve normal development. This will not only benefit millions of cultural adherents in this port, but also the intangible benefits gained by the society will be immeasurable!</p>
<p>The prosperity of libraries is often related to the rise and fall of the country. In modern civilized countries, the development of libraries is regarded as the most important national undertaking, which relies on the support of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Therefore, in addition to hoping that all sectors of society will cooperate to assist the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library's picture exhibition, we also hope to do our best to establish new libraries open to the middle and lower overseas Chinese. Currently, the Journalists Association is appealing to all sectors to donate books, and we hope that all sectors will give a warm response and assistance. Passing on classics and history to future generations has always been considered a beautiful story. Today, if we can generously donate money to purchase and donate books to pass on to the world, then benefiting the world and prolonging life, its achievements are especially unparalleled. We are here to sincerely appeal to millions of people who are panicked about spiritual food!</p>
<h3 id="e23">A Comprehensive Discussion of the International Situation (Conclusion) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chongsheng</p>
<p>In terms of financial resources, during the European War, Germany was a debtor nation with foreign investments of 25 billion marks, which could offset the tangible import surplus by about 4 billion marks each year. From 1914 to 1918, its import surplus totaled 16 billion marks, and until the end of the European War, the gold reserves of its national bank were still worth 2.5 billion marks. Today, Germany is a debtor nation, with its long-term and short-term public debts totaling 10 billion marks. Although it has gained tens of millions of pounds of gold reserves since annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia, even if combined with its own existing 6 million pounds and some secret reserves and foreign exchange, it is still a small thing compared to Germany in 1924.</p>
<p>In the past, Germany and Austria had such superior situations, but they were still defeated by the Allied forces due to insufficient raw materials and food. Today's Germany still lacks food and raw materials as before, and its financial resources are far inferior to those of that year. Therefore, although Hitler's ambitions are strong, he will never bet his national fortune on a single throw of the dice.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion</p>
<p>As of this writing, the international situation is improving. What makes people most excited is President Roosevelt, who is far-sighted and unwilling to yield, when the aggressors are flexing their muscles and presenting their final threat, on the one hand, he demonstrates the demeanor of a politician, sending telegrams to Hitler and Mussolini, suggesting peace; on the other hand, he uses his constitutional powers, sending warships to the East, to exert real strength as a check. This has caused the dictators to hesitate and stop, and his contribution to mankind is truly not insignificant. However, being prepared for danger in times of peace, Western Europe, having gained this moment of respite, should make even greater efforts to promote the formation of an anti-aggression front. It must be known that today's peace is the peace of force. How could Hitler and Mussolini, who worship Nietzsche as gods, be moved by Roosevelt's call? They are actually intimidated by the vastness of the United States' strength and have to be cautious in their actions. However, at a time when the United States is still difficult to actively participate, the military cooperation of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is an indispensable element for stabilizing the European situation. In the past month, exchanges between envoys have been extremely frequent, but the good news of cooperation has still not arrived. This is truly worrying. It is found that some financial and industrial giants in Britain and France have always been suspicious of the Soviet Union due to class consciousness, and are still confused by the one-sided reason that the economic interests of Germany and Italy in Southern Europe are fundamentally conflicting, and they are still indulging in the delusional idea of alienating Italy. It is deeply hoped that Chamberlain and Daladier will wake up from their dreams and move forward without hesitation, so as not to repeat their mistakes and miss this last opportunity, leading Europe into an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>Japan is a ××× of international law. Since joining forces with the Berlin-Rome Axis, they have echoed each other and colluded with each other, doing everything they can to contain and threaten. My country's resistance to Japan, its international significance, has been one of the circles of the peace front from the beginning. Unfortunately, the leaders of the democratic countries in Western Europe were temporarily confused by the idea of compromise and complacency, allowing my country to struggle independently and allowing the aggressors to use the trick of divide and conquer. Fortunately, after more than 20 months of heroic struggle, the Western European democratic front, having woken up from its dreams and reorganized its forces, has gradually realized the importance of my country's international responsibility and is moving towards the ideal stage of expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East. At this time, the international situation is suddenly clear, and the final victory is getting closer and closer. I would like to express my sincere hope to the authorities: (1) In the military aspect, with greater efforts, expose the weaknesses of the × people and prove that my country can be worthy of this international responsibility for anti-aggression. (2) In the spiritual aspect, urge the country's cultural warriors to conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda on the key to this victory, so that our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance will become stronger. (3) In the diplomatic aspect, seize this fleeting opportunity and actively carry out diplomatic activities with democratic countries. The day when democratic countries wake up will be the day when our country's victory begins. We only need to uphold the spirit of perseverance and implement the national policy of sustained resistance, and the time for national liberation will be at hand. May our compatriots encourage each other!</p>

<h3 id="e24">British and American Merchants Eagerly Seek Development Below; Japanese Goods Actually Occupy the Hong Kong Market; Selling at Low Prices Succeeds in Capturing the British and American Goods Market; × Pcs of Fabric Orders Have Now Reached Over 30 Million Yuan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the war in Hong Kong, the number of residents has suddenly increased to 1.3 to 1.4 million. The demand for general daily necessities has increased with the increase in population. As a result, all commercial businesses in Hong Kong are showing abnormal development. Under this special situation, Japanese goods, which have already plummeted, have suddenly tended to recover and become active in the Hong Kong market. In addition, the active promotion of their low-price dumping policy has evolved to the point where, today, the sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong have become increasingly acute. What comes into our eyes is nothing but Japanese goods, which almost occupy the entire Hong Kong market. A few months ago, British and American trading firms in Hong Kong, seeing the rapid expansion of sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong and the gradual seizure of the British and American goods market, rose up to eagerly seek countermeasures. After careful consideration, they believed that the only condition for the best-selling of Japanese goods was based on the low-price dumping policy. Therefore, on the one hand, they paid attention to the sales situation of Japanese goods in the market, and on the other hand, they contacted their domestic manufacturers to order low-priced pieces of fabric and other goods to be shipped to Hong Kong for sale in order to compete with the low-priced Japanese goods. At the same time, they also carried out close contact with general Chinese merchants, cooperated with each other, and tried to expand the British and American goods market. In addition, they also engaged in advertising and publicity, so that people in Hong Kong and China have a deep understanding and distinction of the products of British and American manufacturers. Unexpectedly, while the British and American trading firms were actively promoting this work, Japanese goods were like a river pouring down, fiercely arriving. The shipment of cotton and wool fabrics and rayon fabrics exceeded several million per month, and the numbers of seafood canned food, children's toys, daily porcelain utensils, cement, etc. were also huge. Because of their low prices, which were two or three times lower than British and American products, both wholesale and retail could obtain considerable profits, and the business people who were seeking every penny were happy to promote them, resulting in the accumulation of Japanese goods throughout the entire Hong Kong market. British and American fabrics and the market for various daily necessities were overwhelmed and most were seized by Japanese goods. Moreover, the market for local cloth and other woven products produced by various weaving factories in Hong Kong was also greatly oppressed, and sales shrunk day by day. According to people in the weaving industry, the weak sales of Hong Kong manufacturers in Hong Kong this year are rare in recent years. The only reason is that they have been hit by the low-price dumping of Japanese fabrics. The Southeast Asian market has also suffered the same fate, and its impact on the future of Hong Kong's weaving industry is not small. According to reliable sources, as of the end of last month, the orders for cotton and wool fabrics and rayon fabrics placed by Hong Kong companies and firms to Japanese merchants and manufacturers totaled a huge amount of approximately 30 million Hong Kong dollars, of which a certain company accounted for the largest number. Judging from the situation, it seems that the Hong Kong market cannot digest such a large number of fabrics. It is expected that in addition to dumping a large number of fabrics in Hong Kong, the buyers will also repackage them as domestic goods and sell them to Southeast Asia in order to achieve their goal of making huge profits.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Guangdong Relief Committee Hosts Hong Kong Members; Reports on Refugee Relief Plan; Divided into Two Types: Active and Passive, Requiring 20 Million Yuan; Hoping Overseas Chinese Will Invest and Donate; Special Office Set Up in Hong Kong <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee held a meeting with Hong Kong-based advisors and members at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., convened by Ms. Wu Jufang, wife of Standing Committee Member Li Hanhun. Dozens of people attended, including Chow Shou-chen, He Xiangning, Chen Ce, Au Fong-po, Cheng Tie-ru, Chen Kuang-wen, Wu Ti-chuang, Chen Yao-yuan, Hu Mu-lan, Wang Xiao-ying, Xu Wan-jun, Feng Zhu-wan, Liao Mengxing, Fok Chi-ting, Zhang Zhaotang, and Zeng Xiaofeng. Chairman Wu Jufang opened the meeting as usual and reported on the work of the Provincial Relief Committee, stating that since the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee's plan to relieve refugees was decided and implemented, it has only been two months, and it has achieved some initial results. In terms of its work nature, it can be divided into two aspects: passive and active. Now I will speak separately. In terms of the passive aspect, during these two months, more than 300,000 yuan has been allocated for relief to refugees in various counties and cities, sending winter clothes, holding fair sales, etc., and organizing rescue teams to rescue refugees in Jishan, Huaxian and the Xijiang area. At the same time, the relief work in various counties and cities is strictly supervised in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the work. (2) In terms of the active aspect, because the opening time is only two months, there are no specific achievements to report to you. Regarding refugee children, it has been handed over to the Education Department to be responsible for, and the province has been divided into several refugee children's education and training areas according to the administrative division method of the province, and they will be handled separately. In addition, it is also planned to establish 70 factories to accommodate refugees,</p>
<p>Work-for-Relief</p>
<p>In terms of funding, in addition to the allocation from the government and the Central Relief Committee, it is hoped that overseas Chinese business leaders will actively invest. The government will provide convenience as much as possible within its capacity. As for the relocation aspect, four areas in the east, west, north, and south have been designated for implementation. The funding is also the responsibility of the government, and small relief stations will be set up in the vicinity of the war zone for the evacuation of women and children for recuperation. The total budget for the above active plan is set at 20 million yuan in national currency. It is impossible for this huge amount to be fully funded by the government. I dare to ask you to care about your hometown and pity the refugees, and to provide strong assistance</p>
<p>so that it can be successfully completed. Now, for the convenience of consultation and contact with all sectors of Hong Kong, a special office has been set up in Hong Kong, and Mr. Feng Zhu-wan has been entrusted to be responsible nearby. Please give your advice so that we can follow it, and we will be extremely grateful, etc. Then Zhou Shouchen, Fok Chi-ting, Chen Ce, Au Fong-po, He Xiangning, Liao Mengxing and others first expressed their opinions, and Feng Zhu-wan also asked all sectors for more guidance. Finally, the chairman summarized the opinions of the members and decided to hold a symposium once a month in order to review the work and encourage the future, and planned to divide the business, industry, learning, women, banking, and free professions and other sectors. Carry out fundraising work, and the meeting was adjourned at half past four.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Secret Meeting of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce: Proposal to Close the Library; Directors Strongly Oppose Due to the Library's Connection to Hong Kong Compatriots' Culture; Meeting Ends Without Result <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Nine days ago, during the 24th board meeting of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, reporters were once asked to leave the meeting, and the contents of the meeting were kept strictly confidential. Until yesterday, there was still no public announcement. Believing that the matter was of great importance to society, reporters made inquiries from various sources to ascertain the truth. It is understood that the meeting was to discuss the issue of the library's continued existence. A heated debate ensued. The matter arose because certain individuals within the Chamber's executive committee (all fourteen members) recently proposed that the library be closed and handed over to the Confucian Society, with the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce providing an annual subsidy of one thousand dollars. This proposal was immediately submitted to the 24th board meeting (all one hundred members) for discussion. The reason given was that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce was experiencing financial difficulties and lacked space. This was met with strong opposition from the directors, and the meeting ended without result. It is said that the opponents generally believed that the library was closely related to social culture, public welfare, and mass benefit, and were determined to fight for its preservation. They also stated that if the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce had insufficient funds, each director could increase their annual membership fee by three or five dollars to make up the difference, and it would not be necessary to close the library, which had been operating for many years. It is noted that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library was established in 1929 and has a history of ten years. According to the Chamber's 1937 yearbook (the 1938 yearbook has not been published), the library has a total of 22,802 volumes. The average number of readers is just over 351 per day, and the number of books borrowed is just under 627. It has a great impact on the culture of Hong Kong compatriots. In 1937, the library's expenses were three thousand dollars, but the actual expenditure was only two thousand four hundred and five dollars, eight dimes, and nine cents.</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e27">Good Young People of Hong Kong! <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Kee Cheuk</p>
<p>Participating in Collective Life: YMCA's Membership Drive Breaks Record This Year</p>
<p>Enriching Theoretical Cultivation: Life Bookstore's Youth Day Book Sale Also Breaks Record</p>
<p>Young people have passion and vitality. They can create everything and destroy everything. They are the "meritorious officials" of history and the sinners of history. They can be praised and cursed by people. The key to these two extremes lies in their thoughts and their view of life.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, because of the acuteness of stimulation, young people tend to go to two extremes more obviously. They either make people feel especially lovable, or make people feel extremely regrettable!</p>
<p>Let’s not talk too much about the regrettable ones. Here, let's talk about the lovable young people:</p>
<p>First of all, it is necessary to talk about the unprecedented success of the Hong Kong YMCA's membership expansion campaign this time. The YMCA is originally a progressive group with a long history in Hong Kong, and it has made many contributions to youth activities and social work in the past. The association holds a membership drive every year and conducts a fundraising campaign at the same time. Last year, the 29th members totaled more than 4,000. This time, the 30th renewed registration of old members and added about 1,000 new members. Now there are about 5,000 members in total, one-third of whom are students, and two-thirds of whom are people from all walks of life, such as banks, merchants, and employees of various organizations. There are also many adult and middle-aged people. The "youth" in the YMCA means spiritual vitality, not mechanical "biological age." In name, the YMCA is prefixed with the three words "Christian," but in fact, non-Christian members account for 40%. What do these 5,000 people join the YMCA for? Their basic creed is: "We do three things: labor, creation, and cooperation"; "True friendship is like health, only valued when lost"; "From family members to social members."</p>
<p>The target of their fundraising campaign this time was 30,000 yuan. However, because of the efforts of the fundraising teams and the good faith of people from all walks of life in the YMCA, it exceeded 1,745 yuan and 88 cents. The total amount raised this time was 32,745 yuan and 88 cents, which laid a solid economic foundation for the association's cause. The fundraising method was divided into 21 teams, including Chi Ming, Wei Han, Pui Ching, Fuk Ng, Siu Kei, United Youth, Chong Long, Pui To, Sing Tao, Hip Wo, Kwai Cheung, Zi Yang, Yik Zhen, Hui Tuk, Yan Wing, Kwai Fong, Pui Ying, Min To, Chung Him, Sing Ng, and students. As a result, the Chi Ming team won the championship, raising 5,017 yuan. It turned out that Mr. Lam Chi Ming is the son of Hong Kong gentleman Mr. Lam Pui Sang. He has extensive contacts and is shrewd and capable, and is enthusiastic about social undertakings, so he established a great achievement for the group. In addition, Mr. Chow Siu Ng, who won the personal fundraising championship, and Mr. Li Kai Hon, who won the championship for recruiting the most people, were also hard-working cadres.</p>
<p>Now that we've talked about members and funds, what do they do and what activities do they play? Among the four focuses of intellectual, moral, physical, and group education, the regular ones include: drama club practice, air defense bicycle team, first aid services, national crisis prayer meeting, staff morning prayer, foreign language class, English and business evening class, Puler specialty class, Mandarin class, bookkeeping and abacus class, comic class, English discussion group, military service, Chinese singing group, school volleyball, elementary swimming class. Basketball training class, public basketball: fitness class, members' badminton competition, public children's book stall, children's association, youth choir, middle-aged and youth group morning meeting, air defense research class, Tai Chi class, nurse class, first aid team, Mandarin research class, scout drills, morning fitness exercises, etc.</p>
<p>There are also many temporary activities. And the greatest and most glorious is to return to the country to serve with the army. (This newspaper had a special report introducing it a few days ago).</p>
<p>The association held a special celebration banquet last night to reward the outstanding contributors who contributed money and effort this time, totaling more than 220 people, because the results of this membership drive and fundraising broke records. First, Chairman Lam Chi Yim gave a speech, announcing the progress of this membership drive, followed by Pastor Wang Ai's prayer, followed by Zheng Dechao leading the public to sing, everyone sang together, and then Yang Shaoquan gave a speech, narrating the history of the YMCA in detail. Peng Shaoxian also gave a speech on the importance of the YMCA's work during the war of resistance. Finally, Lam Tsz Fung presented awards, and there was thunderous applause for a while, and the air in the fitness room was unusually tense. We believe that these hardworking young people who have contributed money and effort will definitely have more hardworking and outstanding achievements for our country and our society in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a large group of good young people who are also extremely lovable, and that should be said from the Life Bookstore's cheap book dumping campaign:</p>
<p>We know that "May Fourth" is Youth Day. "May 1st" to "May 7th" is Youth Sports Week. This is not only a new trick this year, but also has great significance. The Life Bookstore, which has been working hard for culture, based on its consistent style, has been carrying out a large-scale cheap book dumping campaign since "May Fourth." Although there is also his "business sutra" in the middle, this "business sutra" does not conflict with the promotion of culture. Many knowledgeable young people cheered from this and flocked to the Life Bookstore in groups.</p>
<p>The covers of the cheap books are slightly damaged, but they do not damage the overall appearance. The highest discount is 50%, and the lowest is only 10%. The books published by the store are all available, and the young people who are thirsty for knowledge squeeze together over and over again, reluctantly lingering. This is the spiritual food that they urgently require. Unless they don't have money in their pockets, no one is willing to let go of this rare opportunity. The reporter squeezed inside to observe carefully, and felt very happy in his heart for these young friends. According to the person in charge of the store, there are about 500 to 600 customers every day, and 70% of them buy books. The other 30% who can't even afford cheap books just treat it as a pilgrimage to the library. "Quenching thirst by looking at plums" and "feasting over the butcher's counter" are also happy events.</p>
<p>The daily income from selling cheap books was the highest on "May Fourth," with more than 360 yuan, and the lowest was on "May Seventh," which was only 132 yuan in half a day. From "May Fourth" to yesterday in a week, a total of 1,492 yuan worth of cheap books were dumped. Social science and literary books each accounted for half, and the customers were students and other knowledgeable young people.</p>
<p>The store's cheap time is still continuing. A promising young man knows that spending money on tea houses and bookstores has the same cost, but the results are different. This large group of good young people is extremely lovable.</p>
<p>The two examples mentioned above, whether participating in collective life or enriching theoretical cultivation, are all good young people in Hong Kong. The good young people in Hong Kong are not just these. These are just two concrete examples. Those who are "licentious and shameless" are digging their own graves. I sincerely hope that promising young people will look at the bright side, enrich theoretical cultivation, and participate in collective life, so as to grow up in the great era!</p>

<p>The Hong Kong drama community’s Charity Performance Committee for Celebrating Mr. Ouyang Yuqian’s 50th Birthday held its first meeting yesterday at the Chinese Children’s College in Mong Kok. The chairman was Li Hua, the record keeper was Liang Fuhe, (A) Report Items: The chairman publicly read out a letter from Ouyang Yuqian, “To my fellow comrades of the Huanghuagang Performance Committee, I have seen the news that you are organizing to celebrate my 50th birthday. I am extremely grateful for your kindness. However, I don’t think there is anything to celebrate for a 50-year-old. When the national crisis is still serious, where is there any time to take care of personal birthdays? And disclosing this news in the newspaper seems a bit exaggerated. In your opinion, Yuqian is 50 years old, and should be encouraged so that he can do more work. I will certainly take this kindness with sincerity. I am older than you, but my contribution is not more than yours. As you have mentioned that I have reached 50 years old, I am truly ashamed. I will certainly do my best to undertake the work assigned to me for the re-performance of Huanghuagang. However, please withdraw the organization of the Celebration Committee. With this I express my gratitude. Respectfully addressed to the comrades of the Huanghuagang Performance Committee, Yuqian.” (B) Discussion Items: (1) Mr. Ouyang’s letter declined, but the celebration will still be held. (Passed), (2) The name of the celebration will remain the same. (Passed), (3) An explanation should be added to the Ouyang Yuqian Celebration. (Passed), (4) The re-performance period is set for the nights of the 20th and 21st at the Po Hing Theatre. (Passed), (5) The participating groups will be the Charity Performance Committee.

<p>At 3:40 p.m. yesterday, a tragic case of a man being seriously injured by chopping occurred on Peel Street, Central. It was learned that a young man, about 20 years old, was walking near the stone steps of Peel Street and Ching Wong Street when a man suddenly appeared with a kitchen knife and unexpectedly chopped him, repeatedly hacking him three times. The injured man fell to the ground, and the perpetrator, knowing that he had committed the crime, fled with the knife. Passers-by nearby, seeing this, immediately blew their whistles to call the police. Later, police officers arrived at the scene, and immediately reported back to the police station. The officer on duty reported the line, and immediately dispatched Central and Western detectives and detectives from the murder case team to the scene to investigate, and called a cross ambulance to send the injured man to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. It was found that the injured man, named Chan Pui, was chopped and seriously injured in the head and hands, with his wrist almost severed, and bleeding heavily, fearing for his life. The police are making every effort to investigate this chopping case. According to nearby people, the perpetrator is a member of a certain society, because he had a quarrel with the injured man a few days ago, and held a grudge in his heart. Now the police are paying close attention to this matter, and have dispatched detectives to track down the perpetrator, and have detained seven or eight suspects for interrogation. Also, at around 9 p.m. last night, a carpenter named Ng Wai Sing (36 years old), from Zhejiang, at No. 7 Austin Road, Kwun Chung, in front of the Yuen Shing Camphor Wood Shop, was sitting and resting in front of the shop when a man suddenly came with an axe, looking fierce and menacing. As soon as he saw Ng's face, without saying a word, he swung the axe at Ng. Ng was injured on the spot and fell to the ground unable to get up. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the perpetrator personally went to the Yaumatei Police Station to surrender himself, saying that the reason for attacking Ng Wan Sing this time was purely because Ng had seduced his wife, and he was unwilling to wear a green hat, so he attacked him to vent his anger. The officer on duty, in addition to immediately detaining him, immediately dispatched a large number of Central and Western detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate, and used a cross ambulance to send the injured Ng Wai Sing to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. It was found that Ng was quite seriously injured and lost too much blood, fearing for his life.</p>

<p>At around 5 a.m. yesterday, a police officer from the Mong Kok Police Station, while on duty patrolling near Mong Kok Mountain, discovered a man, about 40 years old, lying in a pool of blood, suspected of being murdered. He reported back to the Mong Kok Police Station. The officer on duty, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Central and Western detectives to the scene to investigate. After examining the injured area, it was found to be on the head, and a small knife was found next to him, so it was suspected that he was not murdered, but committed suicide. Immediately, everyone asked a cross ambulance to come to the scene and send him to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. When he was admitted to the hospital, the injured man was still unconscious, so his name and the reason for the injury are unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Feature: Famous Stars Perform Charity Show; Photos from the Rehearsal Period; "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Diao Chan" Performances Have Achieved Remarkable Results <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>A piece of former glory and fame, mixed with a loud mulberry tune, revealed itself in that Western-style building at No. 221 Kowloon Road. Continuous sounds of enthusiastic cheers were heard. The reporter knew that he had arrived at the rehearsal location of the debutante and celebrity charity performance troupe organized by the Women's War Relief Association. It turned out that this Western-style building was the maiden home of the wife of Tan Shi-fan, chairman of the Women's War Relief Association.</p>
<p>Misses and madams in red and green, and gentlemen in Western suits, sat in a semi-circle at the right end of the living room on the third floor. The positions of the famous musicians were arranged in the center, which could be regarded as a temporary stage!</p>
<p>Miss Lin Qingchu is a patriotic member of the Women's War Relief Association. This time, she plays Granny Jia in the play "Dream of the Red Chamber." Her graceful and dignified demeanor is just like a lady from a prominent family. Lawyer Liu Ruiji plays Jia Zheng, with a mature and skilled performance and excellent singing. Madam Yung Kai Wing plays Madam Wang, with a quiet and virtuous demeanor, and has the style of a noble lady. The role of Qiao Jie is played by Miss Gong Bi, daughter of Madam Tan Shi-fan. Her innocence and cleverness are truly amazing.</p>
<p>Later, the scene of the Twelve Beauties was rehearsed, co-operated by Miss Kwan Pik-ha, Sin Mo-wan, Luk Sau-lin, Luk Ngan-hang, Lo Yu-su, Lo Sau-lan, Lau Oi-luan, Kan Ming, Kwan Yiu-chi, Ho Chor-pik, Man Pui-ha, Sin Mo-lin, etc. Their light and graceful postures, accompanied by the sound of pipes and flutes, were like fairies descending to earth as they sang and danced. Miss Violet stood quietly in a corner. Later, after being repeatedly invited by the person in charge, she explained in detail the methods of singing and dancing.</p>
<p>During the four months of rehearsal, Xue Juexian, Chen Shaolun, and Miss Luo Shunqing often trained them, and theatrical pioneers Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and Mr. Hsu Ti-shan provided guidance, so the art has advanced to a satisfactory state. Now, the instructors are working extremely hard, because the two famous Cantonese operas "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Diao Chan" will soon be staged at the Taiping Theatre for four consecutive nights starting on June 1st. A special "Diao Chan" performance venue has been added.</p>
<p>All the debutantes and celebrities also embraced the pain and rehearsed very vigorously. After being urged three or four times by the servants, they hurriedly ate a dinner and immediately rehearsed the play "Diao Chan" step by step.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Qiyuan played Wang Yun, walking out with a mature and steady demeanor. After listening to the pleas of Madam Liu Zhuosun and Ms. Pang Lianai, who played Diao Chan worshipping the moon, he came up with a plan to use her beauty to deceive Dong Zhuo.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruan Weiyang, a giant in the industrial and commercial circles, is very tall. He stepped onto the stage to the rhythm of the music, using the strength of his dantian to sing a loud passage, vaguely resembling the style of Jin Shaoshan of the Northern School.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhuosun, brother of Tan Shifan's wife, is burly, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, like a living Lu Bu. After being made up, he wore hair and full armor, carried a halberd, and wore a golden sword around his waist. His majestic style was overwhelming. In this solemn and solemn atmosphere, the guests cheered continuously.</p>
<p>It can be said that the debutantes and celebrities in Hong Kong are all mobilized. Those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength to help with the charity performance work, and with the efforts of all parties to rehearse, they can live up to the high expectations of the organizers. With such rapid progress during the rehearsal, it is believed that the official stage performance will be even more exciting.

<h3 id="e36">Our Army Recaptured Hui City on the 9th; Jiangmen Is Surrounded, Capture of the Area is Imminent; The Enemy Suddenly Increased Troops in Rongqi and Constructed Fortifications <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(West River Express) In the lower reaches of the West River, our army has always taken the initiative. Over the past week, our Deng Longguang's troops and the Kwangsi Army, together with the various teams of the Fifth Guerrilla Zone, have advanced on Hui City in different directions, attacking the university and fighting fiercely for three days. They finally recaptured Hui City at 3 p.m. on the 9th of this month. They took advantage of the victory to advance and surround Jiangmen, which can also be captured in the near future. The detailed process is as follows:</p>
<p>Two Days of Fierce Fighting Once Entered the City</p>
<p>It was found that Hui City was surrounded by our army on the 7th. Fearing that their retreat would be cut off, they tried to struggle. On that day, they used the air force to assist in the battle, bombing our positions wildly. On the one hand, they used flat-firing cannons to bombard fiercely, covering the charging. However, our army responded calmly, firing intensively. The guerrilla teams also used the terrain to ambush and intercept, killing 300 and capturing many prisoners. On the evening of the 7th, aircraft could not take off, and our army's group attack became more intense. The next morning (the 8th), the enemy's strength was already exhausted, but they still hoped to defend the danger to the death. Our Fifth Guerrilla Column attacked the west of Hui City from the Shan Shuikou area, charging bravely and killing. They once charged into Huimin Gate to engage in hand-to-hand combat. At about 2 p.m., due to strategic considerations, they temporarily withdrew. On that day, they killed more than 100 more, and captured many spoils of war. After 3 p.m., the fierce fighting slowed down slightly, but became fierce again at night, with the sound of guns and cannons continuing all night.</p>
<p>Two-Pronged Attack Recaptures Hui City</p>
<p>At about 11 a.m. on the 9th, our Deng Longguang and a certain unit of the Kwangsi Army, in coordination with the guerrillas, besieged Hui City again. A fierce battle immediately broke out on the Xinhe Highway in the suburbs of the city. The enemy tried to struggle, but our morale was strong, advancing without retreating, and a certain unit attacked the Jiangmen to Hui City section of the Xinhe Highway to cut off the enemy's retreat. At about 3 p.m., the enemy was unable to support and feared that there would be no way to retreat. They retreated to Jiangmen. Our army recaptured Hui City, pursued closely, and approached Zini and other villages in the suburbs of Jiangmen, surrounding them. The enemy in Jiangmen has become an isolated army. The recapture of Jiangmen is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Enemy Suddenly Increased Troops in Rongqi</p>
<p>On the Rongqi side, the enemy army was unable to take care of the area because Hui City was being attacked fiercely by our army. They only transferred pseudo-police from the Daliang area to garrison the area. However, since the 8th, they suddenly dispatched more than 400 troops from the Jiujiang and Daliang areas to Rongqi to garrison the area, and built defensive fortifications and machine gun positions and artillery positions on the streets and key points. The work was very busy. The enemy's move seemed to be because they failed in Xinhui and Heshan, and they had the appearance of spying on other places from here.</p>
<p>Harassment of Zhongshan Teams Strictly Guarded</p>
<p>In the Zhongshan area, although the coastal area has been slightly calmer in recent weeks, warships and steamships often come to nearshore areas such as Qiren Stone and Tanzhou to fire cannons and strafe machine guns. Such intimidation methods have become commonplace. However, in order to prevent all possible contingencies, our team has increased its defensive strength at various key points along the coast. Yuan Dai, commander of the First District Guerrilla Detachment, in addition to ordering his subordinates to prepare, has also made contact with the main army in a certain place to control the enemy's death.</p>

<p>(Zhongshan News) In the waterway of the Dahuan Tuanying Gejui area on the border of Xin (Hui) and Shun (De), enemy ships and boats crisscrossed, and harassed and intercepted passing merchant ships and merchant waves day and night. At about 12 noon on the 9th, the people of Hengjiang and Huling townships in Xinhui County, because enemy motorboats disturbed Tianhe and searched for property, specially joined forces with the Zhou Jun plainclothes guerrillas to bombard enemy motorboats in retaliation. On that day, seven or eight enemy motorboats passed through the Zhou Jun River. The teams from the two places attacked the enemy motorboats from both sides, sinking two enemy boats and killing several enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Our Guerrilla Force of One Hundred Attacks Taiwan Bank in Guangzhou, Seizes Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars and Safely Retreats <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Report from Hong Kong: On the 7th and 8th of this month, the Guangzhou × Army implemented special martial law, searching pedestrians day and night. The reason for the martial law was that on the morning of the 7th, a guerrilla force of one hundred of our men attacked the Taiwan Bank on Changdi. A plainclothes unit had previously entered through the back door. At the time, the bank was guarded by only three Japanese soldiers, who were all killed by our forces. Our troops immediately seized 260,000 yuan in national currency and 90,000 yuan in silver stored in the bank, and then safely retreated. Approximately 20 minutes later, the Guangzhou × Army discovered the incident and sent a team to the bank to investigate, immediately ordering the implementation of martial law. On the 8th, the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou issued a statement denying that our forces were approaching Guangzhou, claiming that the martial law was only to prevent petty thieves from infiltrating the city.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Our Army Launches Three-Pronged Counterattack on Qiongshan, Encircles × Headquarters and Achieves Great Victory; × Dreams of Occupying All of Hainan Island in the Short Term <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(South Road Express News) Guerrilla Commander Feng Baiju and Liu Juqiu, responsible for the northern region of Hainan Island, have repeatedly defeated the × Army with their troops. Recently, taking advantage of the fact that the × forces stationed in Qiongshan were newly transferred from Qiongdong and lacked combat experience, they launched a counterattack to strike them. On the 3rd, Commander Feng specially dispatched his wife, Liu Juqiu, to lead over four hundred male and female soldiers of their unit in a three-pronged counterattack on Qiongshan. At dawn that day, a thick fog enveloped the area. The three guerrilla columns took advantage of the dense fog to cover their advance, bracing their spirits and moving forward aggressively. The × Army was caught off guard and our right-wing guerrilla队员衝 into the east gate, surrounding the × headquarters. The × Army only then began to respond hastily, struggling desperately. However, at the same time, the central and left columns had already arrived, attacking from both front and back. The × forces were surrounded in the core, unable to advance or retreat, and were forced into fierce hand-to-hand combat with our forces, lasting for four hours. Three hundred of the × Army were annihilated by our forces. At that time, a large × reinforcement had rushed from Haikou. Deputy Commander Liu, in order to avoid sacrifices, ordered her troops to temporarily withdraw, but still firmly controlled the outskirts, holding the × forces in check. The guerrilla force's morale was greatly boosted after this great victory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram from Hainan Island Garrison Commander Wang Gu to the military authorities here, regarding the military situation on Hainan Island: (1) There are × troops in Ding'an, Jinjiang, Qiongshan, Wenchang, and Jiaji. The × troops in the east consist of approximately 2,000 infantry, 500-600 cavalry, 30 tanks, and over 100 armored vehicles. The × troops in the west consist of approximately 1,000 infantry, 20+ tanks, and 20+ armored vehicles. Over a dozen × aircraft are spotted daily, soaring and practicing in the skies over the island. (2) × shamelessly declared that they would eliminate our forces and completely occupy the island in the shortest possible time, and are opening an airport near the county seat of Ding'an. (3) × is currently dispatching a certain traitor to organize a certain puppet maintenance association. (4) Puppet security regiments eleventh and fifteenth are stationed in Tunchang, Shenshan, and other places. (5) There are currently 36 aircraft parked at the Haikou × airport. Barracks have been built around the airport. (6) × is implementing a policy of appeasement in Haikou, issuing proclamations to pacify the people, but our people are unwilling to be subservient and are organizing guerrilla forces to fight to the death against the ×. (7) × is currently transporting large quantities of × goods to the island from mainland China, intending to boost the market, but they are unable to sell them. (8) The Wenchang × headquarters is located at the Jiaochangpo New Wenchang County Middle School, which is approximately two li from the city. × is also building a wooden bridge from the county seat to pass through Xiadong Village for transportation purposes. (9) Currently, a part of our guerrilla force, 600-700 strong, is stationed in Puqian, confronting ×. × has not dared to invade yet, and the people's hearts are calm. (10) The military port opened by × in Yulin Port has been busy with work in recent days, and over a hundred civilian ships have been seized for transportation. Many × officers take turns supervising the work day and night. Furthermore, the barracks built by the Fourth Regiment in Haikou have not yet been completed.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Truth About the × Harassment of Danshui Estuary <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency Danshui Estuary Dispatch] The Danshui Estuary is the throat of transportation for the Siyi region, and the × have long coveted it. This port was once harassed by × on the 23rd night. At that time, the reporter happened to be in Haimen, separated from Danshui Estuary by a narrow strip of water, and was able to hear the military intelligence firsthand. The events of that night are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, the intelligence from the ×× Regiment was: our army has surrounded the × in the meeting city, and it will not be difficult to capture them in one fell swoop. At a little after five o'clock, another intelligence report said that × gunboats were harassing Daze and were repelled by our army. In the evening, the reporter arrived in Haimen and met with Regiment Adjutant Wu of the ×× Regiment. At that time, a phone call was bringing in an intelligence report saying that three electric boats without lights were discovered in Niubang, and there were traces of × gunboats. Afterwards, Wu Tu immediately sent telegrams to various military agencies, all of which were put on alert, and he personally set out to supervise.</p>
<p>At around nine o'clock, another phone call came saying that five ferry boats towing wooden boats had returned from Niubang, refused inspection, and had already passed Gongyi. After receiving this intelligence, staff member Mo was extremely anxious, fearing that these boats might have × people mixed in.</p>
<p>At midnight, a gunshot broke the silence, attracting our attention. Inquiries were made to various places by phone, and the report received was as follows: The Gongyi police chief was on patrol and shouted an order to a policeman. Because there was a discrepancy in the password, he fired a shot.</p>
<p>At about two o'clock in the morning, when the reporter was about to rest, he suddenly heard another burst of machine gun fire. According to staff member Mo, this gunshot was different from the ones fired by our army. Fearing that the × people had really sneaked in, but because there was no other movement, the reporter lay down on the door panel to sleep.</p>
<p>At around five o'clock in the morning (the 4th), a soldier returning from a shift came and said: When he was guarding the fortifications, a member of the militia team passed by and said to him: "Hey! The × have landed, and you're still sleeping here!" When he said it, his voice was very low, as if he were telling a story. The reporter, being half asleep, didn't take it seriously either.</p>
<p>After the soldier left, the reporter also got up. Looking at the clock, it was already six o'clock, and the sky was very bright. After washing up, he went out for a walk. A Mr. Huang, who was with him, ran back to report that × gunboats had appeared on the beach. The reporter didn't believe it and was about to go and see for himself when, in that instant, the × people's cannons and rifles all fired together. The reporter also thought that the × people had landed in Haimen and fled with the ant-like crowd.</p>
<p>After a few days, the reporter took a boat to Danshui Estuary to inspect it and saw very few boats along the river. After landing, he entered Yinlong Road. There was no one in sight, and six or seven houses had been destroyed. The rest were tightly closed. Turning to Daxing Road, there were also many broken eaves and collapsed beams. Turning a corner into Zhongxing Road, broken glass and rubble were piled in the center of the street. Several houses on both sides had also turned into piles of broken tiles. Entering Weixin Road again, this was the main street, and it had been bombed the most severely. A few swallows were flying low between the rubble, adding to the desolation. At that time, an armed soldier was encountered. Mr. He, who was with him, immediately asked him where the ×× officer was.</p>
<p>The sparrows were choking; we stepped into the longest Zhongshan Road again, examining each shop door, most of which were pasted with signs such as "Opening in the afternoon" and "Watchman stays here." When we reached the middle of Zhongshan Road, we saw an ancient temple with its eaves cut off. Mr. He told the reporter: "This is the former site of the Third Primary School of Kaiping County, which was bombed by the × aircraft into this appearance a month ago." The reporter looked closely and saw two large lanterns with peeling paper film hanging diagonally in front of the door, and a line of red slogans was horizontally written on the brick wall: "Military and civilian cooperation to arm and defend Danshui Estuary!"</p>
<p>After walking through Zhongshan Road, we visited Captain Tan of the First Company of the Third District Training Brigade of Kaiping County. According to Captain Tan, the × side did indeed sneak in here at around nine o'clock on the evening of April 23rd, and after landing, they went to nearby villages to rob, seizing a lot of silver, sweet potatoes, and livestock (pigs and chickens), and forcibly made the villagers move into the boats. On the next day, fearing that our main forces at the front would cut off their retreat, they retreated at around four o'clock in the afternoon, so "Sanbu was also tense for a while."</p>
<p>"So, we didn't resist?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, because our main forces are at the front, and most of the team members are also serving in the Daze area, leaving only a few team members to guard, and because the guns were not complete, there was not much resistance," Captain Tan replied.</p>
<p>"How many × people landed?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"Probably more than a hundred in total, the team was very disorganized, and they landed in thirteen gunboats."</p>
<p>"Then, why did the × people fire their guns and cannons so heavily at dawn?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"There are probably two reasons: First, someone opened fire on them, and the × people immediately took advantage of the situation. Second, it was to cover the transportation of things with gunfire," another team member replied.</p>
<p>"Although the × people fired many cannons, most of them were empty shells without bullets!" an armed comrade standing next to the reporter interjected.</p>
<p>The reporter recalled the sound of the cannons that day, and indeed many of them did not hear the sharp sound of bullets drilling, and could not help but smile and asked;</p>
<p>"Was the loss great this time?"</p>
<p>"It's not very big, but the × people's actions have left behind a huge blood debt, (in addition to robbery, ) Captain Tan's words revealed pity and resentment.</p>
<p>Later, the recorder went to the landing place of the × army and saw that a shipyard nearby had been demolished.</p>
<p>After inspecting for a week, I went to the office of the ×× regiment and learned that our main forces were stationed in Danshui Estuary, and another group was heading to the front line this morning.</p>
<p>From this sneak attack by the × on Danshui Estuary, we can learn a most obvious lesson. Encirclement warfare is a consistent strategy of the × people. The front line needs heavy troops, and the rear also needs considerable force to be on strict guard!</p>
<p>May 4th, at Danshui Estuary</p>

<h3 id="e46">Warner Baxter's Domestic Life Before the Divorce <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the judge in Reno was conducting divorce proceedings for a couple who had been married for fifteen years. This couple was Warner Baxter and Rita Carewe. Let's see what their family was like before.</p>
<p>They were married in 1924. At that time, Rita was still working as an extra in "Robin Hood." After the marriage, she gave up her film work.</p>
<p>Baxter's marriage to Mrs. Carewe was his first, but it was Baxter's second. He was once the husband of Gilda Gray.</p>
<p>They had no children after the marriage. Rita believed that a family must have children. Later, after the death of Rita's mother's half-sister, Shani Taylor, who left behind three children, one of whom was Carol Ann, who was only two years old at the time. The Baxter couple adopted Carol Ann as their goddaughter in March 1932, and they were very happy.</p>
<p>Baxter's love for Carol Ann was even greater than that of her biological father. Visitors knew his temper and knew that if they used the little girl as a topic of conversation, he would gradually tell everything.</p>
<p>It was common to see the most popular man on the screen cutting vegetables for Carol Ann in the cafeteria of the studio. He enjoyed eating with her more than with any girlfriend.</p>
<p>Generally, parents who are movie stars don't like their children being photographed, but Baxter liked Carol Ann having her picture taken because he was determined to make his daughter a star too. He even put her in front of the camera in one of his films.</p>
<p>Baxter had four loves - his wife, his work, his airplane, and his daughter Carol Ann. The most beloved, of course, was Carol Ann.</p>
<p>Although life after marriage was happy, it was not peaceful. An incident occurred that caused both of them great pain. A singer claimed that Baxter was the father of the child in her womb and filed a lawsuit demanding 100,000 yuan from him. After a storm, it was later proven that the woman was suffering from a mental illness, and it was settled without paying a penny. That woman had also once sued Richard Dix.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, while learning to fly with his classmates, he suddenly suffered a stroke. Fortunately, his classmate had some skills and prevented the plane from crashing. He then did not appear on the screen for a year and a half. At that time, people thought that he could no longer appear on the screen. However, in 1931, he finally returned to the screen, with a salary of 7,500 yuan per week, plus a percentage of each film.</p>
<p>He also suffered great losses during the recession of 1932. A bank closed down, and he had 48,000 yuan deposited that he could not withdraw.</p>
<p>However, this loss was soon compensated. Carol Ann coming to his home was more valuable than giving him gold.</p>
<p>Rita had told people that her husband was good in every way, but there was one thing she had to argue with him about, because her husband had a pilot's license and his own airplane, and he had to fly everywhere he went, but she was extremely opposed to it and only wanted to travel by land. Although he had taken on the responsibility of a new daughter, it could not stop him from going into the sky.</p>
<p>Because of the likes and dislikes of flying, it often involved arguments about other things, and gradually there was unhappiness between the two. About a year ago, the two took Carol Ann to travel in Europe, and when they came back, they both found that they could no longer live happily together, so they decided to separate. For Carol Ann's sake, they tried as much as possible not to let outsiders know.</p>
<p>Not long after, they went to Reno to file for divorce. Mrs. Baxter said that she had no plans for the future. She did not want to appear on the screen again, but she liked to find some radio broadcasting work. She said, "I have no demands on him that would make him feel embarrassed, so as not to affect his career. In short, I must understand everything about him. This divorce is very friendly."</p>
<p>"There is no other woman in his life, and I have no other man."</p>
<p>No, he really didn't, and even Carol Ann was lost.</p>
<p>That girl lives with her mother in Reno.</p>

<p>Week after week passed, and he noticed that Doris's contracts to travel and sing were not being successfully signed. She herself said that she was waiting for a good opportunity. There were currently many people who wanted her to sign a contract, but it was no use being too impatient. Lionel was very suspicious of this. She realized it, so she had no choice but to sign a contract with only one person who asked her to sign. That person was just a second-rate manager who wanted her to sign a contract to perform for a week in a certain movie theater, just to take advantage of her social status.</p>
<p>However, Lionel did not know about her signing the contract at the time. He was traveling in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and other places for "business." Ganse, however, was making his first concert appearance, using a pseudonym on Miss Carver's program, billing himself as a new American mezzo-soprano. His sudden and extraordinary success was truly astonishing. Not only was he welcomed by the audience with frenzied enthusiasm, but the accompanist also considered him the best mezzo-soprano singer he had ever heard.</p>
<p>He was then about to travel west to perform, and with only an hour to spare, he and his impatient manager, 席, came to New York. He went home, smiling bitterly. Her travels were unsuccessful, but he was going to travel instead! Well, this money was easy to earn, and he really needed the money, and so did his construction company.</p>
<p>When he returned to his apartment, he saw Doris lying in bed, being cared for by a nurse and many friends. Doris had performed on stage in the movie theater, but had been booed loudly by the audience, so she fainted at the time. "You told me a long time ago," she said to him, "I shouldn't sing - you're right. I understand now, my love, I won't sing anymore!"</p>
<p>As she said this, Lionel himself wanted to find words to tell her about his singing success, but he couldn't. Telling her at this time would only make her feel excessively embarrassed. He tenderly embraced her, but she suddenly remembered that there was a banquet at her mother's house that evening, and she wanted to invite him. Alas, he could not refuse this. Love and marriage were more important than concert tours.</p>
<p>Doris said, "But I'm not going to my mother's banquet because she's celebrating the success of my signing a contract to sing in a movie theater!"</p>
<p>She finally went to the banquet and happily told people about being booed. Suddenly, Lionel was stunned to see Miss Carver enter the door. She was also one of Mrs. Bly's guests because Mrs. Bly had met her at Doris's concert at City Hall a few months earlier. Thus, in less than half an hour, the thing that Lionel feared most happened.</p>
<p>Due to Carver's misunderstanding, annoyed that Lionel had hidden the fact that he was going on a concert tour to the West with her, she revealed the reason why Lionel could sing. His mother-in-law and wife expressed disbelief, so Lionel really sang to prove it.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 4:45 PM, the Xu brothers and Li Rurong and He Jialiu competed for the Hong Kong Open Lawn Tennis Doubles Championship. Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong; Mr. Smith, the Colonial Secretary; Mr. Lo Man Kam, the Chinese representative; and Mr. Chow Shou-son, gentlemen, all attended to watch. Deputy Judge Cons, acting as referee, spoke loudly and clearly, audible to all, and his judgements were strict and fair, which was praised by the audience.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, He and Li took an early lead of three to zero with impressive momentum. The Xu brothers worked hard to catch up, reversing the defeat with six to three, winning the first set. In the second set, the Xu brothers used their intelligence to easily take the lead with three to one. He and Li resisted stubbornly, lifting the ball high, from two to three, three to four, to a tie of five to five, showcasing wonderful performances. The Xu brothers noticed that their opponents were adopting a baseline defense, so they used soft shots that landed near the net, winning two games in a row, and winning again with seven to five. In the third set, the Xu brothers seemed a bit careless. Xu Wei-pei had two double faults on his serve, and Xu Run-pei had one, while He Jialiu also had one, but during the rallies, there were excellent performances, especially He Jialiu's forehand sweeps, which were admirable. Li Rurong was quick to the net and good at saving the ball, so the scores were not far apart, from one to one to five to five, reaching a level of intensity. At this point, Xu Run-pei's overhead smashes either went into the net or out of bounds. He and Li finally won back a set with eight to six. In the fourth set, Xu Wei-pei showed his skills, with beautiful overheads and volleys. Eventually, He and Li could not withstand the Xu brothers' combination of soft and hard shots.</p>
<p>After the match, Mr. Pearce, the acting chairman of the Hong Kong Cricket Club, said in a speech, "The Hong Kong Open Lawn Tennis Singles and Doubles Tournament organized by our club has been held for many years. This year, the number of participants is particularly large, and the competition is quite intense. However, according to the criticisms of general experts who appreciate the game, the standard of tennis in Hong Kong has not improved compared to several years ago. I think that Hong Kong lacks evenly matched masters who can learn from each other, so there is no progress. Xu Wei-pei has won the singles championship for the third time, and he and his younger brother Xu Run-pei have also won the doubles championship three times, which is a good record. The volunteer match recorder for this tennis tournament, Mr. Monligan, followed procedures step by step, ensuring that the various competitions were orderly and well-organized, which everyone was satisfied with. This is a great contribution. At the same time, the referees for each match are all volunteers, for which we are very grateful," and so on. After speaking, Miss Du Weilu, the daughter of the general manager of Dodwell &amp; Co., Ltd., presented the champion and runner-up prizes for the Open singles and doubles tournaments, as well as silver cups for the club members. The results of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Wei-pei defeated He Jialiu six to three, seven to five.</p>
<p>Xu Run-pei defeated Li Rurong six to eight, six to two.</p>

<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The final battle for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Cup is set for 4:30 PM on Saturday the 13th at Caroline Hill, with the South China team facing the Navy team. This football match is the finale of the Six Big Championship Tournaments, and whether our Chinese team can sweep the championships and create a glorious record depends on it. At this final juncture, the outcome rests on the South China players' actions.</p>
<p>The Interport team returned on the 9th, and the South China players are all gathered. If a complete lineup is carefully arranged to deal with the Navy, victory seems assured, and the great feat of sweeping the championships can be completed. However, Li Huitang told reporters yesterday that Liang Rongzhao and Li Zhaorong are still suffering from foot injuries and need to rest. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Cup final this weekend is very important, and they will definitely not rashly use the injured Liang and Li, lest they miss the opportunity. It is recalled that in the second match of the Hong Kong team in the Philippines, it was a miscalculation to send Liang and Li, whose injuries had not yet healed, onto the field, resulting in a defeat. With past experiences to learn from, we must be cautious. Therefore, South China's selection this time should abandon Liang and Li and recruit others, he said.</p>
<p>As for Li Huitang's foot injury, it has not fully healed, so it is not yet known whether he will play for South China this weekend. The reporter silently wishes Li a speedy recovery, so that he can fight with the team and enhance the attacking power of the forward line, which will make victory even more certain.</p>
<p>Currently, several South China players have foot injuries that have not yet healed, and they are all key players, so the lineup problem for dealing with the Navy this time requires much thought. We must carefully select players to find a way to win, otherwise it would be a pity to fail due to a single mistake. Therefore, the reporter has specially proposed a perfect lineup. If it is used to face the Navy, victory may be possible, but it is not known whether those responsible for selecting players will agree. The proposed lineup is as follows (Football Field God):</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Liu Qingcai, Lin De, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Chai Beihua, Feng Jingxiang, Chen De, Deng Guangsen</p>

<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Interport Football Team, which traveled to the Philippines, suffered two defeats in three matches, barely avoiding a complete rout. The entire team returned to Hong Kong on the 9th. Captain Li Huitang has written about the experience of the expedition, detailing the reasons for the defeat and the course of the competition, which is specially published to satisfy readers.</p>
<p>Forward Lineup Requires Much Deliberation</p>
<p>I have said in the past that the outcome of a football match is sometimes unpredictable and unpredictable. The final result, as well as the lucky changes within it, seem to have a predetermined number in the dark, which cannot be changed or forced by human power. Seeing our team's first night battle in the Philippines on April 30, the theory of a predetermined number strengthened my belief. First of all, the teammates who left early all complained that the weather was too hot and that they could not sleep well at night. Fortunately, we refused all social activities during the day in order to rest for the big battle. After lunch, we discussed the structure of our team's forward line. Because of the four forwards, Rongzhao's foot injury had not healed, and Ge Ni's stomach illness was even more severe. The talents were exhausted here, which required much deliberation. After careful consideration, Rongzhao's foot injury was deemed unreliable, so the following eleven players were used to face this Interport match:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Shi Han, Li Tiansheng, Ge Ni, Birodu, Su Qiao, Hou Chengtou, Gao Shannu, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Yan Bachen</p>
<p>Crowded Spectators, Unprecedented Spectacle</p>
<p>We started the match at 8:30 PM, eating dinner early at 6:00 PM. At 7:00 PM, in order to facilitate night combat, we wore white shirts and white trousers, and started with battle clothes. (After the defeat, some said that our wearing white robes was an ominous sign, how deeply superstitious!) When we arrived at the stadium, the noise was deafening, and there were crowds of people. According to the Philippine authorities, this evening's event was the most grand since the Far East Games in 1934. Before the match, in front of the lineup table, I introduced the teammates one by one and shook hands with Mr. Wei Jiasi, the chairman of the Philippine Sports Promotion Association. At 8:30 PM, the two teams faced each other, and Hong Kong referee Auma blew his silver whistle, giving the order to mobilize. After two or three passes, I received a pass from Dagao and penetrated deep into the enemy's formation. About 20 yards from the goal, just as I was about to kick the ball, I was unexpectedly sandwiched by three or four enemy defenders, and several people fell to the ground. I was also injured as a result, and the big tendon in my right leg was in great pain and I could not move. This tense moment at the beginning of the battle became the fatal blow to the Hong Kong team. After being treated by my teammates once, I still tried my best to fight, but I felt weak and like a stranger. Knowing that after this change, the morale of the army was shaken, and it was difficult to avoid defeat with few against many. Thinking of this, I felt very sad, and I deeply felt that the Creator was deliberately teasing people.</p>
<p>Attacked from Front and Back, Suffered Defeat</p>
<p>The forward line had reduced its attacking power, and the forwards were scattered and disconnected. The back line was in bitter battles, and the first half was in danger several times. Fortunately, Junqian made a miraculous recovery and repeatedly turned the tide, barely avoiding losing. However, the defenders were already exhausted and could not fight anymore. Knowing that losing was only a matter of time, they lost three goals in a row in the second half, which was irreparable. At this time, the enemy's momentum was so hot that they almost took whatever they wanted. Fortunately, the teammates did not give up and worked hard to resist the enemy. In the circumstances of absolute unfamiliarity with the climate and geography, they were still able to fight to the end. Near the end, Dagao headed in a goal. The teammates worked harder and harder because of my injury, which was admirable. Thus, in the first Interport match held in the Philippines, the Hong Kong team lost to the other side by one to three, which disappointed many domestic fans. However, the predetermined number was such, what could be said? In short, there are four reasons for our team's failure:</p>
<p>There are Four Reasons for the Defeat</p>
<p>(1) The weather here was the hottest in these two days, and the teammates all felt sleepless and mentally exhausted, so they could not last long in the battle. (2) It was the first time for our team to fight at night, and we often suffered from high balls. (3) Many of the British troops had not faced a major enemy, so they were timid and kicked blindly, far from their usual level. Yan Bachen was particularly ineffective, which made people think of Guangsen. Even the recently promoted Yingqi was far from Ge Ni and the Portuguese forwards. Moreover, Rongzhao was absent, which made the forward line collapse even more. The domestic fans should not be blamed, which was also a reason. (4) My injury at the beginning of the match was said by many to be a premeditated plan by the enemy to deliberately attack. Whether they did it on purpose or not, the disaster came too quickly and caused a huge change in the morale of the whole team. It was impossible to avoid defeat. The above is all the factual process, not an excuse after the defeat. Moreover, all the members worked hard from beginning to end, and the human affairs had been exhausted. As for the non-combatants, Junqian was particularly hardworking and made great contributions, which was amazing. I felt guilty in my heart, although the disaster was not caused by myself, but indirectly it was the cause of the defeat, and I could not shirk the responsibility. The Philippine team replaced four members when they came to Hong Kong, and after a month of hard training, their coordination was pure and their strength was full. Their performance was better than when they were in Hong Kong. However, our team's strength was not complete, and this match was not a touchstone for the Philippines team. Although they won this time, they did not show any superiority in skill. However, their quick fighting and adaptation to night battles, as well as their fighting spirit, were commendable. It is not easy for visiting teams to win without sufficient strength and excellent skills. The quick setbacks of the Portuguese, Saigon and China here are not surprising.</p>

<p>Since the Hong Kong and the Philippines Interport Football Teams visited each other this year, the relationship between them has become closer. Last Thursday, the Hong Kong expedition team officials and the Philippine Football Association members held a meeting at the "Huahua Mountain Club" in Manila to discuss the continuation of the Hong Kong and Philippines Interport events. The Philippines side said that most of the footballers are university students, and the time of the Lunar New Year is when students are busy with their studies, so it is not easy to ask for leave to go to Hong Kong to compete. Therefore, they proposed to change the original plan. After Hong Kong understood the other party's difficulties, they decided to have the Hong Kong team expedition to the Philippines in February each year, and the Philippines team to come to Hong Kong in April.</p>

<p>Last (Tuesday) night's basketball match between Sing Tao and South China resulted in South China losing by two points, 29 to 31. However, after the game, South China said that during the second half of the competition, Sing Tao had a notification record, blew the whistle to stop, and replaced another person to play. The recorder immediately blew the whistle. When the South China players suddenly heard the whistle, they stopped their fighting actions, but Sing Tao took the opportunity to score a goal during this time, and South China lost two points because of this, which was very unwilling. Therefore, they stated that they would appeal. The reporter believes that this matter is related to which team will win the championship, so yesterday he specially visited Lin Zhongnuan, the director of the basketball department of the South China Association, to inquire about everything. According to Mr. Lin, regarding this misunderstanding, our team officially submitted a letter to the Basketball Joint Committee yesterday (9th) to appeal. The reason stated in the letter is based on the fact that when Sing Tao replaced players that night, the recorder blew the whistle to stop the game. However, the whistle that the recorder blew at that time was not a different sound whistle, so our team players thought that the referee had blown the whistle to stop the game, and the entire army stopped its actions. The Sing Tao team then took the opportunity to shoot the ball into the basket, and later realized it was a misunderstanding. At the end of the game, our team lost by two points. According to the situation at the time, it was indeed the recorder who blew the whistle, and our team suffered a loss of two points, so we specially appealed to the Joint Committee to wait for a solution. It is heard that after the Joint Committee receives the letter, it will convene a committee meeting within days to discuss and resolve the matter.</p>

<p>There were three school volleyball matches yesterday: Senior, Junior and Juvenile. Senior: Queen's College against Wah Yan College. Queen's College has a very strong fighting force and good defense, while Wah Yan's offense could not be coordinated, and Queen's took the opportunity to attack repeatedly. In the preliminary round, Queen's College attacked fiercely and took the lead with 21 to 18. In the second game, Wah Yan fought back calmly and stubbornly, winning with 21 to 14. After that, Queen's College's offensive was extremely strong, with both attacks and pressure. Wah Yan lost again with 13 to 21. Queen's College took advantage of the victory and pressed even harder, winning again with 11 to 10, with a total score of three to one. Junior: Southwest against Yucai. Southwest's coordination was scattered, and the battle became one-sided. Yucai won three games in a row, winning with three to zero. Juvenile: Yinghuang against Southwest. Yinghuang was stronger and won with three to zero. Today, there will be three matches, with the schedule as follows:</p>

<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>Lixi's Three Flowers brand powder is finished. She pulls open the drawer and hauls out half a dozen powder boxes, but they're all used up.</p>
<p>It's such a nice sunny day today, and my face has so many freckles.</p>
<p>What else is there to say? The 'rear' actually gives her such unexpected disappointment. If she were still in Shanghai, she could buy everything she wanted. The things she couldn't buy were things she wouldn't even think of. But now, without her even thinking about it, things she can't live without are gone too. Can Three Flowers brand really be out of stock? After being cooped up at home for days because of the freezing rain, there's such a nice sun today. Today, she simply must go out, 'but my face has so many freckles.'</p>
<p>She sits down on the sofa. If she weren't sitting on the sofa, her face would be facing the mirror on the dressing table. When there's someone else in the room, especially when her Three Flowers brand is finished, she doesn't like the dressing table, because it's somewhat too extravagant, the neat background making her face seem to have even more freckles. She only likes the small mirror in her handbag. But if she could still remember, that dressing table was given to her by a man when she first rented this room; and the full set of makeup in that handbag was taken from another man. How surprised and grateful she was then.</p>
<p>Ultimately, spending a high price to buy makeup for a woman, or hiring two servants to carry a bulky dressing table to her new home, is still a common occurrence. Lixi has even forgotten, or at least she has to pretend to have forgotten. Does she need to say thank you twice for a gift? Obviously not necessary, and she doesn't want to either; she's determined to be a brand new woman.</p>
<p>She thinks that a brand new woman should have a brand new life, and her so-called brand new life means she should have Three Flowers brand powder. She has male friends, but she can't say too many thank yous to these male friends, even if the gifts she receives are expensive.</p>
<p>What else is there to say now? The more she thinks about it, the more regretful she becomes. Why didn't she buy more when she left Shanghai? Couldn't she have bought some when she passed through Hong Kong? She visited every department store, but now there's no Three Flowers brand on her face.</p>
<p>She also thinks of a phone call she just received. She imagines that the face next to the telephone is a straight-lined face. A mouth that loves to talk, that mouth must be talking on a wide tie. And then he'll think of her words.</p>
<p>And she's already agreed to his request. He's coming over soon. When he comes, she has to accompany him to the countryside for fun. Of course, dinner will be eaten in a high-class restaurant. Lixi only needs to take out a handkerchief to wipe her mouth after eating, covering her mouth and smiling demurely, without needing to say any words of thanks.</p>
<p>However, she still can't shake off the annoyance that's gripping her. Can she get through the days without Three Flowers brand powder? Having come to such a remote rear area, she can settle down quietly, but the days without Three Flowers brand are something she never imagined before. She can't help but think, today there's such a nice sun, and my face has so many freckles.</p>
<p>In the past, those were such affluent days. There wasn't a single material lack in her daily life. She was materially wasting her days. She never even thought that she wouldn't have Three Flowers brand powder in some corner. Now she has finished her Three Flowers brand days in this remote rear area. A few days ago, she was almost entirely cooped up at home because of the freezing rain. Today there's such a nice sun...</p>
<p>A clever idea suddenly comes to her mind, making her happy enough to almost jump up. She can't accompany a boyfriend for half a day, or even a minute, without beautifying herself with Three Flowers brand powder. She grabs her handbag, puckers her lips, whistles a cheerful tune, and runs out of the room.</p>
<p>She instructs the old nanny to tell anyone who comes looking for her to wait a while, she's going to the street for a bit and will be right back.</p>
<p>Of course, Lixi is not happy to haggle with department store clerks anymore. She runs out of her Liujia Nunnery residence. A clear sky is waiting for her at the stone steps. The warm sunshine is shining on her chic cheongsam, her face—</p>
<p>She goes to the barber shop.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Lixi is bathed in the glow of beauty. Her face is so fair, powdery, and exudes a fragrant scent. She's already rejoicing in her own beauty.</p>
<p>Although she has to spend a lot of money in these fifteen minutes, this seems to leave her with a bit of dissatisfaction towards the rear area. Yes, everything is so expensive. She wouldn't know that some people are eating three meals of green broad beans every day. All she knows is that she'd rather pay a high price and still can't buy Three Flowers brand powder, and that her face has too many freckles.</p>
<p>She runs out of the barber shop and calls for a rickshaw back to Liujia Alley.</p>
<p>'Three dimes.'</p>
<p>'One dime and a half is fine.'</p>
<p>'Two dimes and I'll take you.'</p>
<p>'One dime and eight cents.'</p>
<p>'Miss, I'll take you back.' This voice cutting in makes her turn her head to look. She sees a straight-lined face, a mouth that loves to talk, that mouth saying these words on a wide tie.</p>

<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>——One of the Tragedies in the Occupied Area</p>
<p>Just like entering their own home. After landing at Daya Bay, the disorganized troops of the enemy marched toward Huiyang. They did not encounter any exciting resistance, nor were they greeted by artillery fire, adding a tiny black spot to the brilliant pages of the war of resistance!</p>
<p>The terrifying dark clouds covered everyone's hearts. The citizens of Huiyang began to flee in all directions. The countryside is separated by mountains and water, and it is so remote, will the enemy not come to visit? Thus, tens of thousands of citizens, carrying men and women, carrying luggage on their backs, waded through mountains and rivers, and walked the night roads to the remote countryside.</p>
<p>A female normal school teacher from another place, intelligent and beautiful, and also a girl with a heart full of spring. In the midst of the howling wind and crying cranes, she fled like a farmer's dog to the countryside outside the city.</p>
<p>First, she walked breathlessly to a village more than ten miles away, sincerely requesting the villagers to lend her a corner to hide in; but the villagers replied in unison:</p>
<p>'No, you are a short-haired girl, please do not stay here!'</p>
<p>Wiping away her tears, she turned to another village with infinite disappointment.</p>
<p>Similarly, no one was willing to lend her a corner as a temporary shelter; even, she was refused permission to rest there for a moment longer. Their reason for refusing was:</p>
<p>The Japanese devils will arrive soon. If they know that there is a beautiful, short-haired girl hiding here, they will definitely force us to hand her over, and this will implicate the entire village!</p>
<p>She was so tired that she couldn't breathe, and the color of blood had been stripped from her face, presenting a deathly gray, but she gritted her teeth and continued to walk wearily.</p>
<p>The sky is vast, where to go? She wandered and hesitated on the muddy path in the field, crying. When the fire of seeking life rekindled her frozen heart, her remaining strength pushed her feet forward, walking to another village, knocking on her door of life again.</p>
<p>No different, the third village was also built with 'selfishness' and 'terror' into a high wall that she could not cross.</p>
<p>She stared blankly at the gate of that village, standing like a puppet for a long time, and then hopelessly trudged on the vast muddy road.</p>
<p>Unable to walk a few steps, fatigue bound her feet, and terror solidified her heart; a gust of clear sky wind blew down her weak life!</p>
<p>On that day, her father used a huge sum of six hundred yuan to send someone to hire a special car to pick her up and escape, but she had already protruded her unmoving eyeballs, tightly closed her unopenable jaws, and lay on that desolate field, knowing nothing at all.</p>
<h3 id="e61">On the Popularization of Poetry <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bo</p>
<p>——Regarding the Re-Publication of 'China Poetry Forum'——</p>
<p>Poetry germinates and grows among the people, and poetry expresses the general cry of society. In principle, poetry should belong to the masses.</p>
<p>However, the traditional habits of thousands of years have isolated the creators of poetry from the masses. Most people think that poetry is something mysterious and abstruse, and that poets are a special class that is pure, lofty, and does not eat the fireworks of the world. Some people hold another view, pointing out the 'romantic love' of poetry and the 'detachment' of poets. From whichever aspect you look at it, it is extremely distant from the masses, so 'poets' in China have become transcendent, and 'poetry' leaves people nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>'Popularizing poetry' under this situation, in order to shoulder its mission of the times, has become an extremely urgent task.</p>
<p>Many people are enthusiastically discussing this topic, and the principles and paths are being reiterated in detail, but regrettably, 'theory' is still limited to 'theory', and practical work is still too little. Although we have seen some recitative poems appear, they are only scattered and few.</p>
<p>Appearing in a new posture, the re-publication of 'China Poetry Forum' not only cultivates a good soil for the desolate anti-war poetry scene, but also is a powerful vanguard in the popularization of poetry. It gathers the strength of a large group, using simple brushstrokes to convey the trends and emotional responses of the anti-war movement. The themes are realistic, and the words are fresh and easy to understand, without making people feel unfamiliar; and even more, it will not be like some people playing with 'pseudo-beautiful' electrical tunes. If you are not very busy, you can read all the more than twenty poems in one breath.</p>
<p>However, the popularization of poetry is not just a question of 'understanding' or 'not understanding'. Plekhanov said:</p>
<p>'Art must unite, and encourage, the emotions, thoughts, and will of the masses.'</p>
<p>Gorky also said earnestly:</p>
<p>'Poets cannot but respond to all music, respond to all the voices of life.'</p>
<p>In other words, poets must melt their own hearts among the masses, and strive for the sake of the masses in everything, only then will they create 'mass poetry' and 'popularize poetry'. From this perspective, the gains of 'China Poetry Forum' - the achievements are not very bad. Pu Feng's 'I Put On Earth Clothes', I think is the best piece. As for reaching the realm of pure poetry popularization, this publication is currently not very satisfactory. How to hone the words to be more popular, and how to make the content closer to the masses, are the most important keys in the process of poetry popularization.</p>
<p>However, at the very least, 'China Poetry Forum' has at least washed away that mysterious and abstruse outer garment.</p>
<h3 id="e62">A New Posture in Qujiang <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ding</p>
<p>Passing through Qujiang—this wartime metropolis of Guangdong—I unexpectedly ran into a large group of comrades working in national salvation. They had all withdrawn from Guangzhou at the last moment, distributed to work in the Xijiang and Nanlu areas, and had recently gathered in this place.</p>
<p>They wore grass-green uniforms and straw sandals. Many had already joined the armed forces, belted up and wearing military caps. Although their faces showed the appearance of being weathered, they had a healthy beauty; they often sang majestic and cheerful songs, but the tone was more calm and experienced than in Guangzhou. Everything showed a hardworking spirit honed from arduous practice.</p>
<p>On the road, there were often long-separated comrades who met again, shaking hands warmly and exchanging sincere greetings:</p>
<p>'Comrade ×, how did you get here too?'</p>
<p>'Yes, our Xijiang Administrative Office ×× team was transferred here for training. Have you been here long?'</p>
<p>'No; our Anti-Japanese Vanguard Headquarters only arrived here last month. What are your plans after training?'</p>
<p>'We will train for a month, and then we will be assigned to work in various guerrilla areas!'</p>
<p>'This work is very interesting, I hope you all work hard.'</p>
<p>'Don't make fun of us. You have rich experience, you should give us more guidance'; 'What about Comrade ××?'</p>
<p>'He is in the Military Commission's ×th Engineering and Political Brigade, and is about to move to the Gaoyao area. Do you want to see him?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I would like to meet him - how is his little Miss?'</p>
<p>'Little Miss came with him too. They live and work together in ××. She is even more proactive than before! People say that this war of resistance has broken up many couples, and also made many couples, which is really true! Haha.'</p>
<p>'Haha, after all, love and revolution are not contradictory.'</p>
<p>'Hey, what is your address?'</p>
<p>'Our address is Zhengxiang ××, ××; what about yours?'</p>
<p>'You can just write to the ×th Army Post Office.'</p>
<p>'Okay, goodbye, we will communicate and learn from each other in the future;'</p>
<p>'Goodbye! Work hard!'</p>
<p>After shaking hands warmly, they hurried off to their respective duties.</p>
<p>For several days in a row, it was sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy. The county town of Qujiang, which had been more than three-quarters destroyed by enemy planes, had fewer pedestrians on the road than usual. However, the people passing under the air raid warning tower on Fengdu North Road could not help but stop to look at the wall newspaper. Here were 'Everyone Writes', 'Daily Current Affairs News', as well as comics, slogans, a national crisis map, reports from military and political organizations, and air raid notice boards... Especially the wall newspaper was very outstanding, with popular current affairs explanations, songs, anti-war stories written in the old style, the handwriting was upright, larger, with simple colored line decorations, embellishing the large characters with beauty, freshness, and liveliness.</p>
<p>Having just arrived here, I found this situation very novel and interesting. I think that the various working groups in Qujiang can use this environment to achieve some educational effects, and this is a good opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Snow in Manchuria <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>It is late at night. Happy people have already fallen asleep. The people who bring happiness to others have not yet slept. They are sitting at the table, holding a small gathering. After more than an hour of discussion, they decided on a reply to Zhu Lin's father: the ransom was reduced from 500,000 to 300,000. If one woman is missing, Zhu Lin's life will be used to pay the price; a reply is still required within three days. If the deadline is exceeded, there will be no further discussion.</p>
<p>Then, Erwen sent a comrade to deliver the letter. He and the remaining comrades were still discussing other questions.</p>
<p>The street is quiet, the houses are quiet, everything is almost quiet. In the silence, there is only the gentle snoring of the guard, only the restless wind and clouds, accompanying them in their low-voiced conversations:</p>
<p>'If Zhu Lin's father doesn't redeem her, what further steps should we prepare?'</p>
<p>'If he is willing to give her up, but still wants to reduce the ransom, how much can we ultimately reduce it to?'</p>
<p>'...'</p>
<p>The third day.</p>
<p>Zhu Lin didn't have a good sleep, disturbed by dreams of returning to the country. After waking up, she still got up in fatigue. She neatly folded the bedding and placed it in a corner of the small bed; she also plucked off the withered flowers in the bottle, leaving only the fresh green branches - that is to say, she still loved their life, and wished them a long life in the spring. Then, she wiped the table, the windowsill, and the four sides of the small bed. This was like her old bedroom, clean, tidy, maintaining a normal order. However, at home, maids did the work for her, and she never did it herself: even if small objects fell to the ground, she would call a maid to pick them up. Sometimes, the maids decorated the bedroom, and her feelings were different, making her often dissatisfied. Now, after tidying up the room, she looked at it, and felt satisfied with everything. Things done by one's own hands are always as one wishes. (Sixty-two)</p>
