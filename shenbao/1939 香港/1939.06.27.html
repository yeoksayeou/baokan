<p>社評</p>
<h3>英人的憤慨與美政府的關懷</h3>
<p>自日本軍隊殘暴封鎖天津租界並屢加英國人民以難堪的侮辱以來，英國舉國人民卽備極憤怒，並且日益激昂。這是英國人民注意遠東情勢，督促英國採取相當强硬政策對付日本的表現。另一方面，美國駐蘇大使日前曾通知蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫謂：羅斯福總統對於英·蘇，法談判之進行，深切關注。這是在表示：美國政府不但希望英蘇法互助協定早日成功，即美國自身也與有密切關係，願意與英，蘇，法合作抵抗侵畧者。</p>
<p>這些事實指示着世界反侵略中遠東位置的重要性，英國政府急須直捷了當地順此大勢勇往邁進。英國在世界侵略者暴行之前，無論在歐洲抑在遠東皆首當其衝，英國不但要趕快接受與國之聲援共同奮鬥，並須自已對侵略者不屈不撓地給予有效的反擊。英國無論在歐洲抑在遠東，對於侵略者的進攻，都沒有妥協，退讓的理由和必要，英國退讓則反促侵略者得寸進尺，並且影響其他的民主國家合作鬆解。英國要造成領導反侵略陣線的地位，要有這種風度，遠東侵畧者日本，也就不敢向她進攻，欺侮了。今日英蘇法三國協定一旦締結成功，則英國這種指導地位就算成就，英蘇法三國協定成立後，美國之决心加入反侵略鬥爭是沒有問題的。美國能為英國撐腰，則今日欺壓英國最兇的日本、自可稍減其氣焰。因為美國海軍的力量及資源，足够日本好戰軍閥時時刻刻在深切攷慮。這正如彼蒂勳　致『每日電訊報的長函（英海軍在遠東的地位）中所言，「日本顯然能盡一切之可能避免侵及菲律賓，並務求不侵害美國的權益，由此可以再度證明海軍威力，實高於一切」，可知美國對於日本侵略的阻止，具有極大的作用。</p>
<p>自天津事件發生以來，英國人民對於英國政府早日完成英蘇法協定的希望更為迫切。據倫敦方面的消息，今日爭持之主要點，仍為波羅的海國家保證的問題，『觀察報』對於此點認為，同盟國家的目的卽在戰敗德國的侵略，德國對波羅的海的侵略，將為對蘇的間接侵略、故不問波羅的海各國是否願意，該同盟國將必予以保護，彼等如此，並非為波羅的海國家，而是為蘇法英三國之利益」。同時，「星期泰晤士報」也極力主張：「英國須接納蘇聯的要求，即保證波羅的海各小國」，並謂：『三角同盟之能否成立，决定於英國對蘇聯讓步的程度』。『觀察報』更謂，「無論波羅的海各國答應與否，英國實須將保證範圍展至該區』。這些都是英國人民憤怒的表映，英國政府該如何順應，是日前重大問題之一。</p>

<p>— 本報特稿　林高　（一）</p>
<p>廿一日的早晨，還不够五點鐘，便響起空襲的警報，很多人在睡夢中驚醒，天還沒有亮，星星在雲朶的空隙處閃眼。</p>
<p>熹微的陽光慢慢地增强，×人的水上機十一架，四散開來，在市空低飛，市郊的農民挑着沉重滿祖的靑菜趕赴市場，空襲沒有擾亂全市人們的生活。</p>
<p>七點多鐘了，傳來×人要在港外海岸登陸的消息，爲的市區距離港口只有三十里，一自抗戰開始，×人便屢次用汽蜓駛近岸邊，一經我軍開槍，便逃弋開去。單就這个六月，×人便有三次大規模的幾十隻汽艇同時作這樣的舉動，還曾經開火幾十分鐘過呢，海港口上有水雷封鎖海海到市區的陸上有防軍的工事，沒有聽見×人車艦的砲聲，沒有聽見防軍的槍聲豋陸的事决確的不會的，認爲這不過是×人又來一次騷擾吧。假如，×人眞個是登陸了，「疏散的警報」必會連響五分鐘，那時逃跑是不會遲的。</p>
<p>街上不斷有賣艾葉，「舍甘子花」棕球，凉粉棕，……各等過節物品的担子挑過，人們在準備過節×機　飛這樣長久，一個惡毒的　炸是决不能免的。　（未完）</p>
<h3>湘北一俘虜</h3>
<p>— 彭河溥</p>
<p>【中央社新　通訊】最近我軍生擒到兩個×人，其經過頗饒趣味。原來×寇侵擴岳州臨湘之後，一直就沒有安枕過，不光只鐵路公路屢被破壞，軍庫粮站遭焚燬、並且時常受到突如其來的襲擊，縱然提心吊胆嚴密戒備，但我游擊隊神出鬼沒，防不勝防，尤其×人後方的電話綫，往往十里八里不翼而飛，他那裏甫經架好，我們又三担五担約滿載歸來，只忙煞了××的通信兵、弄得他一籌莫展，叫苦連天。</p>
<p>新牆河北戰事方酣之際，羊樓司平水舖間的電線忽又全被截斷。×人在無可奈何中生出一條詭計，派了個通譯官化裝下鄉，以圖　地調查個水落石出，而謀澈底防範，並兼帶　察我方軍情。這傢伙銜命從岳州前往，三十日抵平水舖，次晨卸下了『皇軍」××××、扮成鄉　模樣，就外表看　也不知是個×寇，何況還會說中國話呢？他和路　僞聲同行，另有×憲兵兩名遙遙護衛。</p>
<p>鐵路南邊阡陌縱機，往年正是農忙時俟，處處秧歌，農夫們多麽怡然自得，可是這美滿的生活已被打破，殘暴的×寇毀滅了他們的家鄉田地，而令所有只是一片荒凉。迎面來了三個襤褸的鄉人，這傢伙暗想從他們總可探聽些消息，不禁喜上心頭，及至近身詢問，只見三人丟個眼色，便敏捷地把他連僞警一齊挾了囘來。說句不好聽的話，這簡直條『綁票』。那地點　　路邊的×憲兵才三百公尺，而三位壯士不過身　手溜彈數枚。</p>
<p>看俘虜個子短小，但面生橫肉，我料定不是道地××××。後來訊問他，果然是台灣人，他叫陳松泉（又名松出達雄），生於基隆西町二番地，曾在上海泉漳中學肄業五年，後來返台經商，去年十一月十六日被徵到滬，在虬江路×特務機關當通譯，今年二月十六轉運動到中支派遺軍第九師團司令部任通譯官：階級是動八等，原駐蒲折，五月十八日隨吉住司令來岳州，他現年卅四歲，家與尙有妻子及兒女三人。</p>
<p>我遞過一支香烟，他分外高與，問到×人南犯的損失他承草鞋嶺更口諸役受創最鉅，現在四所野戰醫院滿住傷兵，約計有兩千左右。從「維持會」「難民區」「慰安所」及變相妓院的「食堂」等導名詞中，他無意透露出岳州城內充滿妖氛，我不及逃出之男女同胞則　於殘破的家園，橫遭蹂躪凌辱度着那鬼影幢幢的生涯。這正是一風景不殊，舉目有山河之感！</p>
<p>×軍厭戰可于將士思家見之，他們雖知師出無名但爲了服從君命，不敢公然反戰。一卽如我被徵後，不得不忍痛立卽結束生意，因爲二十四小時內不應召就要「槍斃」。言下希噓不已。他說×在台　平日厚歛　稅，侵華戰爭以來，又增添不少「皇軍慰勞」一類的捐款，人民負担更加繁重。在高壓之下，仍有革命　潮發生，台灣人免服兵役就是×人放心不下的原故。</p>
<p>談到僞軍，他竟木然不知。後來告訴我，「有之，那祇是東洋兵特意滿腮蓄着髭　，胃充蒙古人肆行殘暴」。這種企圖挑撥我民族間感情的卑劣伎倆，可恥亦復可笑。提及我神勇空軍，去年遠征台　，他猶有餘悸。當中國飛機突然凌空而至，炸彈巨響震驚天地，恐怖籠罩了全島，聽說損失慘重，只是當局秘而不宣，一般人認爲在毫無準備之下，飛機場定然吃了很大的虧。</p>
<p>×國的戰地記者都是隨司令部走。「現在岳州方面有朝日新聞，日日新聞，各報的特派員，不過電訊須經參謀部看過才准拍發，不利的消息是要被扣的。」從而可知×軍閥是在如何欺騙世人，陳君又追述他　父原籍　建漳州，貿遷台灣，「我父親送我到上海讀書，卽是預備叫我在中國作事，其後父死返台，日本便不許我再度來華了」。</p>
<p>下面是他用中文寫成的感想，現在一字不改照錄出來：「被捕人惟加待斃，豈知貴國寬仁博愛，不但不處於死，優待且豐，誠仁人之邦也。此後雙方和平解决之時，若能寬罪索放歸台，就是再造之德矣，設若不棄劣材，　有差使，勿敢不從，當効結草以報德耳！」（中央社）</p>

<h3>「捐血週」</h3>
<p>昨日巴黎電稱，法國於本星期舉行「捐血週」，總統勒勃倫將親赴各輸血研究院參觀輸血設備，並發表演說，解釋在戰時輸血工作的重要，鼓勵人民自動的向翳師登記，檢驗血液，俾萬一發生戰爭後，以應戰士輸血之需。法國政府爲愛護將士，未雨綢繆，有如此者—反觀我國，數百萬英勇將士，轉戰兩年，其慷慨捐軀者，則遺族千萬，急待濟助，其慘遭殺傷者，則呻吟火線，急待拯救，而活躍于戰區，×人後方的救亡工作者，則不僅精神物質，俱無接濟，尙不免遭受漢奸××頑固份子以至地方惡勢力的多方陷害—看看人家吧！我們縱不能捐血，至少亦應該求其良心所安，量力濟助這些英勇爲國的戰士們吧！</p>
<p>正氣</p>
<p>汪精衛等假『和平，反共救國」之名，以作欺民賣國的罪行，不僅違反中華民族的利益，並且有違於中國人數千年遞嬗的道德觀念，因此無論前線後方國內海外，甚至國際正義人士，亦均表示痛恨鄙棄。日前怡保梁燊南先生，卽因本港××日報以附和汪逆之言論，而公開登報聲明辭去董事名義，及脫離股東關係；同時梁寬重先生，亦因所譯「列强最近海軍實力」一文，『被時代文選』採與汗精衛叛國文章並列，而登報鄭重聲明。指斥該刊物之非法行動，而香港四維公司，亦因不願被汪派報紙代刊廣告，亦巳鄭重聲明『絕不承認』；昨日各報，並紛刊馬來亞僑團　護國府緝汪明令，而波蘭荷蘭各國報章，亦一致猛烈抨擊汪逆罪大惡極。我們看到這些事實，益覺『公道自在人心』，正氣凜不可犯！不知一般無恥附逆之徒，及以汗逆之言爲言者，胆敢對此正視否！</p>
<p>伯倫在卡第夫發表之演說、其辭日、「吾人不需要倫敦之諾言、而需要具體事實之表現、國際形勢危急之秋、吾人將冒一切危險、追隨政府、譬如一人、不事冒險、則永無勝利可言、英政府人昌之危言恫嚇、吾人將毫不介意，彼等之恫嚇、固無實力爲其後援也、日軍迫令英人裸體檢杳、英政府竟無可如何、德國皇帝之軍隊、及德國民族、雖曾一度爲人所擊敗然此乃旣往之事實、可一而不可再者矣</p>
<p>【路透社柏林二十五日電】德工黨餵袖里氏今日在波次丹當一萬六千政治領袖之前、討論「英國在天津忍受侮辱」之理由、里氏謂、「不論從任何方面觀察此世界帝國、所能發覺者、祗有失敗之事實而已、英國倘非拒絕德元首之邀請與德聯結一致，則斷不至陷於目前之境地。英國今日在天津所感受之封鎖痛苦、質與其前此對付德國者無異、而英國所受之侮辱爲尤甚焉、目前問題。固不在遠東方面枝節之單調，而在英所須忍受之整個恥辱云。</p>

<h3>討債難</h3>
<p>你欠人家一塊錢嗎？</p>
<p>我的朋友杜少校欠了我一塊錢。已經欠上十二個月了，恐怕很少歸還的希望吧。我每次遇到他，總想起他已經忘記欠我一塊錢了。他遇到我時，還是向來那一副坦白誠懇的態度，我那塊錢已經被他忘得一乾二凈了，我曉得我永遠拿不囘那塊錢了。</p>
<p>在另一方面，我一生都會記得杜少校欠我一塊錢，我相信對於我們的友誼毫無妨礙，可是我卻永遠不能忘記這件事，不曉得別人怎樣，不過假若有人向我借一塊錢，我一直把這件事牢記着，一直記到進入墓穴。</p>
<p>讓我把事情說出來吧，在去年四月八日——我特地把日子寫出，因為杜少校或許會看到這篇文章——杜少校要到巴台去，向我借這塊錢後。當時他坱要一塊零用錢，要租汽車，我便借給他，事情發生得又簡單又自然，直到事情過去，我才有點覺得，他祇說：「給我一塊錢，好嗎？」我說：「可以可以，一塊錢夠嗎？」我曉得杜少校把那塊錢接去時，他原意是要還的。</p>
<p>他從巴台寄一封信給我，我想把信打開時，那塊錢一定在裏邊。可是沒有，他祇說氣溫高到近一百度。他這意思，不知道是不是說，熱昏得連欠我塊一錢都忘了。</p>
<p>三星期後，杜少校囘來了。我到火車站去接他，——並不是因為那塊錢，而是因為我真的看得起他，我覺得他去了三星期回來時，看見有人在車站接他，一定很快活的。我特為說：「我們租部汽車到俱樂部去吧。」可是他回答說：「不，我們走去吧。」</p>
<p>那天晚上，我們一直在一起。看着巴台。我當時想到那一塊錢，可是當然沒提起。用什麼法子提起呢！我問他巴台地方用的是甚麼幣制，跟美國洋錢的市價可一樣——我說美國洋錢時，故意說得稍微響一點——可是結果還不能叫他想起那塊錢。</p>
<p>不久之後，我幾乎每天與杜少校在俱樂部裏碰頭——我才明白他已經完全忘記那塊錢了。有一天，我問他這次花多少旅費，他說他沒記賬。後來，我又問他施行生活可安定得下，他更顧左右而言他因此我曉得一切都完了，</p>
<p>我對杜少校一點也沒有懷恨的意思我祇把他加在欠我一塊錢，而忘記還我的人的名單上，現在名單上已經有不少人了。我對他們所抱的態度並沒改變，我祇希望我能把這事忘記。</p>
<p>我時常遇到杜少校，前天晚上，我在吃飯時遇見他，他自自然然地談着波蘭的事，他說波蘭永遠不會還所欠的債，你們總以為這一類的事會叫他記起欠錢的事了吧？可是並不。</p>
<p>不過在這時候，時常有一種頗為心痛的思想，浮現我的腦際。我想，假若杜少校欠我一塊錢，把事情忘了，那麼從理論上說來，我也該有欠人家一塊錢，而把事情忘了的可能性。也許人家也有一張單子記下來，我越越覺得不痛快，因為我一忘記借人家的一塊錢，我一生一世也不會還的。</p>
<p>世界上假期有借錢給我的人，我希望他們會說出來，不是一時全來；而是一部份一部份來，最好能依字母次序來，我將立刻把他們的名字寫在紙上，不過我得聲明，我不把打撲克牌時借給我一塊錢的人算在內，我也不去想到——我有意不去想到——上個月在體育俱樂部把三角錢借給我買汽水的那個人。可是假如有人在我要到巴台去時，借一塊錢給我付汽車資，我一定把那塊錢還給他。</p>
<p>不但如此，我想要發起一種大運動，一種「恢復誠實」的運動，叫大家把那些借來　錢都還清。我們要記得，那些最強大的國家，都是建立在絕對誠實的基礎上的。</p>
<p>末了，我想請讀者諸君別把這份報亂丟，免得被大學俱樂部裏的杜少校看見。不過，如果他真的看見了，而肯就此把欠的一塊錢還了我：那我倒也要謝謝丟這份報的人。</p>
<h3>氣象台</h3>
<p>前兩天，日方宣傳，在僞滿邊境，與蘇聯空戰，擊落蘇聯戰機四十九架。蘇方斥為無稽，不值一笑。現在蘇聯公報出來了。擊落日機五十六架。不知日方是否也要說並無其事。這也許就是二十世紀的廣告術吧。</p>
<p>說起廣告，前天還在說香港人不會做。可是顏色來了。一個嚮導女，竟謊報失竊，而希望在報上看　名，好本事也。哎呀，話說了，真替他做起廣告　　。</p>
<p>昨天，香港兩件事，你不能不注意。一、日本人將在香港辦英文報，斥資二十六萬元。二、日本領事的秘書，在軍事區攝影。</p>
<p>香港的時疫，似不能算不兇，但防疫的工作，似乎還不太好。許多市民，學生，　還不曾打防疫針。而赴澳門的防疫手續，收費二元之鉅，這，似乎都是值得攷慮商的。</p>
<h3>一日一人</h3>
<p>大家也該還記得，不久以前，戈林曾到意大利去遊騁。戈大胖子還專程趕到的黎波里島，去訪問意國空軍元帥巴爾波將軍。</p>
<p>兩上空軍巨頭坐在一起，少不了又是談起飛，飛，飛。戈林吹了一屯德國牛皮之後，巴爾波也不甘示弱地，講起意國空軍：</p>
<p>「我們最近發明一種輕便飛船，又快，又靈，跟飛機一樣，戈將軍要不要試一試？」</p>
<p>出風頭之機會，不可錯過也。戈林滿口願試，并且，一定要親自駕駛。</p>
<p>於是，兩人上了船，戈林駕駛，巴爾波坐在一旁。凌空而去。</p>
<p>飛了一刻鐘，一切都好。兩個一齊誇不絕口。於是，決定下降了，一萬尺，五千尺，三千尺，一千尺，五百尺。巴爾波一看，下面有點不對勁，不是海，是飛機場。</p>
<p>「老戈，不對呀！這是船，　　在水上面　　」</p>
<p>「笑話！這我還會弄錯嗎？我不過在這里看看吧了。」</p>
<p>說着，戈林把飛船再升起來，飛向海面去，巴爾波倒不好意思起來。</p>
<p>終於，在海面上停下了。</p>
<p>戈林少不得又要誇獎一番：</p>
<p>「這船真好，跟飛機一樣，只是可惜不能在陸上降落。」</p>
<p>，他們推開，一脚跨出去，　龍通，堪在水里了。</p>
<p>「我早說，這是船呀！」巴爾波輕輕地自言自語着。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，將軍，這樣大家舒服些了！」</p>
<h3>答：</h3>
<p>昨天的八個八，就是下面這樣加法的。你猜嗎着？</p>
<h3>雋語</h3>
<p>我厭惡戰爭，不僅是因為戰爭危險，不方便，更因為戰爭犧牲了許多青年，其中也許有一個牛頓，愛因斯坦，貝多芬，莎士比亞，或者甚至於有一個蕭伯納哩。——蕭伯納</p>
<p>我恨葬禮，假如逃得了，我真不想出席自己的葬禮。——羅勃馬立斯</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>張先生是一家大報館的第一號廣告員，口齒伶俐，語言精通，兜起廣告來，無往而不利。可是，在桃花運上，張先生卻不夠工夫。</p>
<p>一天，也許因為女朋友頂了下吧，張先生竟英雄氣短起來，跑到海邊，要與波臣為伍。</p>
<p>「喂！跳不得呀！」一個大胖子警官剛走過，一把拉住了。</p>
<p>「為什麼不能跳呢？」張先生展開了他那三寸不爛之舌，暢論非跳不可的理由。</p>
<p>五分鐘之後，猜怎麼着，那大胖子警官跟張先生一同下海了。</p>

<p>前文摘述　一九一四年秋，德輪「凱隆柏齊號」，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯船公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷　　，在船上接着個消息。說　　宣戰了，英軍艦來　　隻船。船便無目的地狂奔起來。不久，無線電中又傳來附近有冰山的消息，幸虧冰山不久便滑過去了，但是不久，又有一艘英兵艦來攔截，開炮起來，打中船尾，但，僥倖霧　下來了。……</p>
<p>這時船已駛近霧中，巡洋艦上，知道凱隆柏齊號已經有了護身符，想　往她的　望已　很微，但是，他們仍努力的加快，煙卣裏不住的冒煙，現出他們還要跟那正飛逃着的「運金船」拚那麼一拚。</p>
<p>勃　克艦上的炮又響起來了，一炮開在船尾上，正打中了那着金花的船名。</p>
<p>「他們想打船舵呢。」傑克說「這原來是個好辦法。」</p>
<p>「但是，若讓他們打中啦，於我們可好不了里。」南諾苦笑着。</p>
<p>又開了兩炮，一炮是第二隻巡洋艦上開的，都在旁邊　通了。這時的霧漸漸把船的四週圈起來，只五分鐘，就包庇得伸手不見五指了</p>
<p>於是，又開始那瞎撞的把戲，船長洛克　吩咐開足馬力在　　　——　　客們要求保障了，能改變了方法，　　的讓熱力只在可能範圍之內。</p>
<p>「在這種處理之下，比爾又　起來了，嘿！　又有甚麼來啦！」</p>
<p>在霧外面，不知是何方向，能聽見有一種聲音，似乎是心怦跳的聲音，這是另外一隻船的機器聲。以前所怕的是被俘，現在怕碰撞了，因為，即使在霧裏，船長還是不許　汽笛聲。</p>
<p>簡直沒辦法分別出是在那一方看起來，似乎可以在隨便那一方。難道這又是一條郵船嗎，還是兵艦呢？這個問題，有點麻煩。</p>
<p>不到片刻模糊的，看見一條巨大，黑色的船，在他們旁邊挨過，在霧裏頭，一眼霎去，在甲板上滿列着大砲，鎗彈。又是一條英國巡洋艦。好，剛離虎口，又送到獵人手裏去了。</p>
<p>「是大英兵艦，這就完事啦！」比爾嚷着。</p>
<p>八　死里逃生</p>
<p>但是，凱隆柏齊號到并不就完事大吉，雖然，　　怪艦上的英　八，在全方　　　　　　亂的當口，他們來不及發下命令，也來不及　　究竟是甚麼一回事，在他們想看看一眼之前，他們又各被濃霧包蔽了。</p>
<p>「　命！這般的　　繼續受下來，我真要到鏡了前去照照，看看頭髪急白了沒有。」傑克說。</p>
<p>「我奇怪他們竟無　舉動。」比爾說，「雖然，我到挺喜歡他們不動。」</p>
<p>「他們或者是太　　。竟忘掉了開砲。」加羅說。</p>
<p>「我也這樣猜。」傑克同意的，「不管他是為甚麼，反正總是我們福星高照。」</p>

<h3>糊塗論</h3>
<p>— 卞落</p>
<p>「糊塗」在現代社會上大抵認為一種並不十分壞的缺點，比起「作惡」來似乎這强勝一籌；如說某人借賭賂光，那是一時糊塗，若是持刀刦財，便有點「作惡」了，但也有糊塗受人稱贊的，「讀書不求甚解」，「不求甚解」便有黏「糊塗」了，可是經陶淵明這麽悠悠然一來，反而贏得大家稱譽。似乎糊塗也有藝術。像普通所稱酒鬼，大抵有點糊塗而受人指責的，但李太白就不然了。鄭板　說過什麽「難得糊塗」，可說提倡糊塗了，如今還有人津津樂追，可見天下事原是各有巧妙不同的。</p>
<p>糊塗也有眞為之分，所謂名人隱士之流的糊塗，大都不是「眞痴」，而是「佯狂」。李太白除了吃酒外，還會哼哼什麽「雲想衣裳花想容」之類，因此至今酒家也還想以「太白遺風」作號召，而劉阿斗倒是個「人生得意須盡歡」的實行者。而且此同「樂不思蜀」，也是他的老實話，却備人笑駡至今，實際上，不管你瑚塗的眞偽，若希圖以「淸高」「隱逸」或其他的美名來掩飾自己糊塗的苟安，也終是白費的，劉阿斗是應被笑罵的糊塗蛋，但在現代，再欲借糊塗以逃脫，也祇能證明自己的沒落。</p>
<p>天下最多的便是自作聰明的糊塗蛋，他門不旦自己糊塗，而且希望別人和也一樣糊塗。「與虎謀皮」該是理想的傻瓜了。而偏有對虎叩頭求饒，以求粦閔，或送上點猪肉牛肉或自己的一乎一脚，希圖給虎一個滿足，等到知道上了虎的當，該眞誠地請求獵戶了，偏又怕打盡了天下老虎，弄得世界太淸靜了。天下很有這樣的糊塗蛋。至於自己的泥足已站不穩，却還希望打得別屈膝，其勇雖可嘉，但實在却是糊塗的低能了。</p>
<p>又若掛上一付和平的面具，發一套兩敗俱傷的胡言，不管是非的屈直，想以投降作苟安，這類人尙不能糊塗逃脫他的罪名，歷史上不乏先例，但結果是什麽呢？曰「遺臭萬年！」</p>
<p>有這樣的笑話：「有個多事人對跪在岳王墳前的秦檜與王氏像起了憐憫，將它們拆了丟在河裏，免得終年受人侮辱，豈知當晚做了一夢，夢着秦檜與王氏來謝。晨起一想：秦檜有這般靈驗，岳王若有靈，又將奈何？連忙去河裏撩起來，重復叫他們跪在那裏，此後不復有人去拆它，成了萬刦不復」。笑話是無稽的，愛憎却很明顯，秦檢看上去也很不聰明，而那多事的人也並不糊塗到底，終於消醒過來，明白了俗人所謂正邪的道理。我希望今之善心人，不會如此糊塗！</p>
<h3>隴海線上（下）</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>——從商邱到蘭封——</p>
<p>四五節車箱，巳載滿了為正義而掛彩的同志，高談著在前線　為得意的事；有些使勁地揮動著負傷的臂膀，忘掉了肉　的苦楚；不時發出高大的笑聲。雖然在子夜，但他們並沒有倦意。</p>
<p>我們為不願侵佔他們的權利，更為了不願使他們再擠一點，决定把我們的行李和公文箱。抬上車頂去，人也就在弓形的車頂上躺下了。</p>
<p>列車在站長的哨子聲中慢慢地蠕動；我們在兩旁樹木的夾縫中駛過，身體平躺在車頂上，欣賞着銀白的天，　動的星，迷糊的村野，幾天來的倦意，給它征服了，想起了上海夏天乘涼的渡論，我們志了自己的處境。幾乎感覺到自己又在夜渡輪上上顚簸。</p>
<p>在夜的微風中，身子感得有些冷意，把身旁的軍毯蓋在胸前。倚在公文箱上的弟兄，巳打起輕微的鼾聲，車繼續在樹木的夾縫中直駛。</p>
<p>幾小時的特等——車頂——車生活，過得够舒適，在睡夢中覺醒過來的時候，車巳停在一個小站上；太陽正昇在空中。滿大都飄着彩雲，是淸晨的時候。</p>
<p>「軋……軋……」傳來很輕微的震動聲，同志們都散落在東站附近洗臉，誰都沒有對這聲　注意。</p>
<p>震動聲漸漸淸楚了遠處紅霞裏發現兩顆黑點；一這是飛機——」車箱裏同志們中已有人在喊吶起來，站上也嗚着警報，負着輕傷的同志，都迅遠地向四周麥出中散開。祗有少數重傷的同志，安心地留守在車箱裏。</p>
<p>我們先把公文箱從車頂上搬了下來，因為太笨重的緣故，不便奔跑長距離，就在離站約百公尺的側面大樹下隱蔽着；附近有個輕傷的弟兄，正在鎭靜地嚼着大麵。</p>
<p>飛機漸漸近了，兜了一個圈子，目標準對車站，但四周空虛得很，祗有幾節大半空着列車，無聲無息的躺着，車頭也早己在警報發出時駛遠了。</p>
<p>它加快速度，沿鐵軌上上空掠過，高處掛下兩個銀色鐵蛋，鐵蛋和空氣磨擦出尖銳的噓噓聲，我們目送它不來，直到將近頭頂時，才緊閉了眼。</p>
<p>「轟」聲音終於來了；在饗聲下，祗感覺到有許多東西掉在我們身上，但並沒有多大分量。空氣中夾着火藥，灰沙，鼻孔也將給它阻塞住了；眼是根本沒法張開。幾分鐘後，平靜的車站上又開始在活動，我們張開眼，在灰霧中，見那位嚼着大麵的弟兄，正在那裏喃喃地自語，鼓着嘴撥去麵碗中的泥灰。樣子很可惜泥灰糟了這碗大好的麪條兒。</p>
<p>過去不到五十公尺的地方，圍着一堆人，是那蛋落中的地方，沒有死傷人，祗劈了一枝小樹，破壞和平的徒給予人們的不是憂慮，只有憤怒。</p>
<p>二十鐘以後，車繼續行進，但不多時又在民權站停止了，聽說是給負傷同志換樂，每大總有一次，我們趁這機會到附近小鎭上去補充肚子。</p>
<p>那裏市容租當熱鬧，店鋪看來是臨時搭起來的；老百姓很多在街上叫賣。大砲聲，機槍聲，雖是越打越近，可是他們說寗死也不願離開自己的家。他們每家都有一根或幾根毛瑟槍。一旦有機會的時候，就可靠着它來斡一下。</p>
<p>負傷同志的換藥時間，結束在十一點鐘以前，正午又是開車的時候了。我們囘向車去，見尾部多掛上了三節「華僑救護隊」的汽車。車旁坐立着十多個二十內外的男女靑年，穿着一律的制服。套着紅十字會的臂章，由一個四十開外的外國人帶領着，是挺活躍的一羣。</p>
<p>我們同一的主張，就是立刻到他們車上去訪問。</p>
<p>申明來意後，外國人很熱誠的招待我們，他講得一口流利的國語。</p>
<p>他生長在南洋，父親是中國人，母親是英國人，他雖是一個有年紀的人，但愛國的熱情却不後於在祖國的一般年靑的咳子，這次戰爭就開始後，在南洋募了一注經費，率領着十多個在該地讀書的熱血靑年，投到祖國的懷抱裏來。這羣同我們一樣年輕的男女孩子，由老先生一一介紹，熱烈地握着手，有秩序地相互報吿各人，以前的遭遇，他們都能講流利國語。新識的朋友流露出像舊有的情感，我們己打得一片火熱。</p>
<p>將開車的時候，他們很懇切地要求與他們同車，我們沒有推却，把箱子和行李搬上了去；因為太陽　得厲害，我們就鎮進救護車裏。</p>
<p>「火車上坐汽車倒也是很難有的事」！四正帶着滑稽的口吻，引得大家都笑了</p>
<p>一路上談着，唱着歌。直到夜裏車抵蘭封的時候。</p>
<h3>所望於副刊讀者的</h3>
<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>這並不是我　關子，也不是我故甚其辭：假使說，對於一個副刊，投稿者的重要勝於編者是對的，那末讀者的重要勝於投稿，尤其是對的。理由很簡單，編者是分配者，投稿者是供給者，而讀者則是需要者。按之一般通則，需要可以决定一切，所以讀者也可以左右編者和投稿者。此外；讀者佔絕對多數，讀者是大衆，編者和投稿者尤非服從不可。</p>
<p>旣然讀者對於一個副刊，是操着無上的權威的，所以我格外要對他們發出我的希望來。</p>
<p>有許多讀者，尤其是年輕的學生，以為編者和投稿者，總是有大才的人，他們的文章，總是好的，他們的意見，總是對的，因此有時看到了實在莫名其妙或違反心意的作品，也就含糊去，不敢顧問。這是不對的，應該認淸編者和投稿者，决非十全十美的才子，總也有不到之處的，所以我希望這樣的讀者勿自卑。</p>
<p>但是有許多讀者，雖然年長的為多，年輕的也未嘗沒有。却與前者適得其反，以為編者總是糊塗蟲，投稿者總是庸人，對於他們的副刊，連正眼都不肯看一下，大約要編者向他們請敎。別的投稿者虛左以待，方才會合他們的意。這也是不對的，究竟一個副刊的成立，必然有他所以存立的理由。决不能對於它的編者和投稿者，就此一概抹殺，所以我希望這樣的讀者勿自傲。</p>
<p>勿自卑勿自傲的讀者是正當的讀者，我希望他們對於一個副刊，換言之，對於該副刊的編者和投稿者，如果有什麽意見。　可發表出來，方式是寫信給編者，或者自為投稿者，寫成文章投去，這樣，編者和其他投稿者，固然會因你的意見而有所得益，便是一切讀者，連你自己在內。也就會受到你的優良影響了。</p>
<p>你這樣發表意見時，自然知道你應該說出你所不贊成的，和你所希望的種種事項；自然更知道你應該勿長縮，勿過激，而平心靜氣，侃侃而談的。這是你應取的熊度，你知道，我也不必多說。可是當你用這樣熊度來發表意見，尤其寫信給編者的時候，我希望你會有下列的兩種决心：</p>
<p>服善：如果你發表自己錯誤時，你肯取消你的意見，一定不會强詞奪理，或者惱羞成怒，引起人我雙方無益而有損的麻煩。因為副刊旣是大衆的，大衆决不會容你逞私。</p>
<p>去惡，反之，如果你發見自己並不錯誤時，我却願你堅持下去，一再申說，來達到你的目的，或者至少使你所注意的這副刊，修正到略可滿足的地步，因為副刊旣是大衆的，大衆自會擁護你的正當的主張。</p>
<p>當然我知道，所難的是你不知道自己意見是否錯誤，因此，我就是希望你在沒有十分把握，充分了解一個問題時，就暫時不要發表意見。等到有了眞知灼見時，你才實行你的態賡與决心。</p>
<p>總之，我希望每一個副刊的讀者，就以你所看的副刊為你自己的所有物，而設想你就是編者，就是投稿者。你須愛護他：他好，你要發揮光大他；他不好，你要矯正他，帮助他，每一個正當的副刊，總是願意聽到讀者的意見的，希望你會盡讀者之責，與他滿意。</p>
<p>不錯，副刊可以誘導讀者；然而尢其不錯，讀者可以促進副刊，必須讀副者與刊合作，就是與編者和投稿者合作，副刊和讀者才會雙方並得其利。</p>
<p>你們想想看：那一偭副刊應該與以發揮光大的？那一個副刊應該與以矯正或帮助的？我希望你們想到了就實行！</p>
<h3>所望於攝影記者的</h3>
<p>— 王介生</p>
<p>攝影，誰也不能否認是宣傳中很重要的一項。自七七蘆溝橋事變揭開戰幕，以及八一三淞滬抗戰，幹攝影工作的同志們，活躍在大時代的激流中，在敵人的炮火下，很堅苦的工作着，前線後方都有他們的足跡，給了我們很多的刺激，很多的認識，更給了世界人士一個證實，暴露着×人的默行，在宜傳中起了個極大作用，別小看了這幾塊玻璃，却是東亞法西斯强盜的照妖鏡。</p>
<p>可是自從徐州會戰後，我們很少見到攝影同志們的緊張工作，活躍的姿態，因為這樣的緣故，在南潯線德安的大戰中兇惡的敵人不顧人道不顧國際公法施放毒氣，我們忠勇將士受毒後的怪狀，我們只能在報紙上文字中見到，而沒有攝影同志們把這些敵人的行兇確實證據照出來，給我們後方民衆更深的認識失去了對國際官傳的好材料，過去南潯線德安的大勝利以及保衛武漢等戰役，和最近各戰區的反攻。游擊隊的活躍，這許多的抗戰實况，忠勇將士可歌可泣的戰跡，對於宣傳上不知道有多大的重要性，非很能奮發每個人神精，更能加深民衆劉「於最移勝利是我們的信心」，却又很少給我們看到。</p>
<p>在二期抗戰中，無論在那一方面我們已加速地符合二期抗戰的需要，負着宣傳責任很重的攝影同志們，你們能放棄嗎？你們能落伍嗎？並且最近政府通令各戰區司令長官，盡量帮助記者給予交通和各方面最大的便利，在這裏，同志們因該知道政府是何等的期望着，何等的鼓勵着，同志們趕快努力，急起直追吧！</p>
<p>攝影同志們，我們要有犧牲的决心，我們不怕困苦，不艱難，去前線去敵人的後方，更娑符合二期抗戰的需要，我們要武裝開麥拉！</p>
<h3>撲向了祖國</h3>
<p>— 斬以</p>
<p>——還是一個女孩子的故事——</p>
<p>「我說我是大都會的舞女，名字是麗麗，我是到香港去做生意的，我……」</p>
<p>「算了吧，我不要聽下去，趕緊換換衣服洗洗臉吧」。</p>
<p>她們勿忙地站起來，一個洗臉一個脫換衣服。不久，她們兩個又恢復了年靑女學生本來的樣子。</p>
<p>「我們不要把這種衣服留在身邊，到那邊反倒會有麻煩，不如包起來去到海裏去吧。」</p>
<p>「那也好，我也正要看看海是什麼樣子。」</p>
<p>她們把脫下來的衣服放在一個布包裏，說打開　，向着甲板走去。</p>
<p>她們都感到脚步輕飄飄地，彷彿在夢裏一樣，一切觸到她們眼中的，都是那麽陌生，有時不得不使她們自己在問着：「難說這還是在做夢麽？」</p>
<p>當她們走到甲板上，她們頓然感到不是夢，冬日的海風，尖厲地吹透了好們的衣裳，使她們覺得寒濕，那潮潤原是最容易引起人的不快；可是她們却感到非常的爽暢。除去了兩三個洗刷船板的水手，沒有另外的人，她們任意地，從心胸中　出沒有字句的歌，彷彿一切的恐怖，鬱悶都關了歌聲吐出來消散在廣大的海中的上面。</p>
<p>走近船邊，她們更仔細地看到海。海面還平靜的，可是為這隻船衝過去，它就憤怒地叫着，翻滾着雪白的浪沫，不平地吼着。</p>
<p>她們把那個包袱丟下去，好像海巳經張開嘴等待着似的，一口便吞噬下去的隨後又翻出來，可是巳經退後了些，再沉下去，就隨同那些自沬被遺留得遠遠的了。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>

<h3>舊事重提　防毒面具糾紛案　亨利卻立公司　昨上訴遭駁回　仍判第四路軍得直</h3>
<p>十九萬元防毒面具糾紛上訴案，昨在高等法庭，由麥基利哥及傳理沙兩按察司會審，上訴人哥羅士打行亨利却立公司。延晏士道郎轉請少廖亞利孖打及麥南馬拿兩大律師上控，傳審者第四路軍，延吳思豪律師轉請砵打大律師辯護，茲將會審經過、詳誌如左。</p>
<p>糾紛經過</p>
<p>是案糾紛原起、遠在一九三七年、當時第四路車駐港代表與亨利却立公司、訂立合同、購買防毒面具、十萬具、價値港幣十九萬元，高度爆炸性炸彈八千枚價値四萬二千鎊二折合港幣六十七萬餘元其中面具一部份、于一九三七年十一月間抵港、惟四路軍發覺該面具與貨辦不符、乃控公司于連司堂要求退回經已付過之貨款十九萬元、惟該公司不允、及控第四路軍拖該公司炸彈費欵四萬二千金鎊、後由連司判决該反控理由不能成立、應卽撤囘該公司不服、乃復于昨日上訴、此乃雙方糾紛之起點也、</p>
<p>合約內容</p>
<p>開庭後、首由少廖亞利孖打大律師發言、詳述雙方訂立購貨、經與訴訟主因、大略如上、廖氏復謂、連司判决爲不可、應加入四萬二千鎊貨款之追討部份、因該貨乃一出廠卽歸買方負責也云云、繼由砵打大律師代表第四路軍聲辯、謂炸彈貨類合約、雖規定該貨乃BAG性質（卽一切貨款、保險費運費由賣方負責）、然一切貨物、刻尙未由歐起運、而輸運文件、尙未見交到第四路軍手中也、廖氏駁謂、公司方面、早已將貨歸撥買方之用、方欲起運、惟買方不允而已、砵氏又稱、廖氏所言、不無見地、然廖氏並未明暸事件之眞正性質、因C、I、F、之性質、並非一成之合約、卽電示製造廠、將貨撥與買方、便算了事、而是由賣方將一切運儎文件、交到買方、然後方有掃討取貨歡者、今一切文件、尚未交到買方、雖約中附帶聲明、廠方交貨、然仍不能反控第四路軍謂爲破壞合約也</p>
<p>上訴駁回</p>
<p>砵氏繼稱、是案之不能成立、純爲一切文伴尙未由賣方收到、第四路軍當然拒絕付款也、又駁廖氏稱、上訴人雖不蓄意要求第四路軍付款、然上訴而以此種事件爲基礎、蓋絕無關係者、麥大律師繼卽發言、無論上訴是否正當、應早日完結、不應牽延至今、以余意見、是案應有詳加研究之必要、至是、麥按察司乃判决上訴駁囘、繼稱、此案經遠一番熱烈辯論、巳到完結階段、余仍以爲連司所判者爲適當、日內余將判詞公佈云、</p>

<h3>島上風光！「麻雀」「天九」</h3>
<p>— 育蔓</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>夕陽吻着西山。鱗般的流霞，紅一簇，黃一簇，紫的，靑的，點染得格外動人。海拂來了晚風，襲動了富人們的薄羅裳。</p>
<p>——這時，繁華的都市，髣髴在竊竊向人私語：這大好的時光非『麻將』不行了…婦孺們，你們要是不大精通，總有你們熱習了的『天九』！</p>
<p>麻將，天九，是我們的國粹，咱們有這迷人的國粹啊！走到長街，走到里弄，不論是富人的別墅還是窮人的住所。簡直，沒有一處不是劈劈拍拍的狂喧！</p>
<p>是別墅：流線型的銅欄干上，亮晶晶堆映露了盞三頭電燈，風扇在登上揮動，絳紅的綢質燈罩，異樣的堂皇，不貴的家私，黃橙橙地晃亮了沙發上坐下了穿紅着緣的女人們。散尾葵蕭灑迎風，太太們的「雲鬚」也是滿滿滬迎風！沙沙劈拍——他們的「賭生活」就這樣地開場了。是窮人的住所，石憫干旁，掛了襤褸的衣衫，麻布包綴成的骯髒底破水蓬，斜垂下來的——是騎樓的一角，沙沙劈拍，她們是賭的開場。</p>
<p>旅店，酒家，夜的權威，支配了都會底靈魂！電梯，弔上了一批一批底享樂者，聽廂，房座，充滿了醉生夢死的氣氛！二樓，三樓，直至頂樓。席無盧座啊，沙沙沙……劈拍！『紅中』『白板』『發財』其中夾雜了爭執與辯論，還債與淸胡，氛圍裏有深深底香烟氣息，同樣，有茶香，咖啡香，尤其脂粉香！</p>
<p>俱樂都，樂也融駛的，這裏，沒有權球，沒有乒兵游戲，更沒有音樂和圖書。咱們貴國裏底俱樂部大都以『聚賭』爲樂的！賭，與衆樂樂，顧名思義，這就是「俱樂」了。由于參加娛樂者的時起糾紛，每個所謂俱樂部底璧間，幾乎都顯著地掛上了『蔴將的條例』——「……九張落地……再打，……要包……海底撈月，限于夭筒，餘作三番計……」。問　複雜到不可思議，　錢輸錢，條例，規矩，媽的！輸了錢還怕條例底限制嗎？</p>
<p>人們，沉迷　圈裏的人們。總之，每個空間，縱使是擠擁到水洩不通底二層樓宇，他們也要「打脾」的！床上，房角裏，甚而，廚房的門限旁邊，他們同樣坐立了五六個林將天九的朋友。論時間，不分畫夜，幾乎畫是他們的時間了。通宵達且，帶了病底人，他們也得爲賭而犧牲！腦允血，是他們致死之由，可是，前仆後繼地，他們以『不死』的决心，爭取最後的勝利似的？</p>
<p>至于麻將天九「是」，他們那種賭的精神，實在也令入乍舌啊！一間絕無窗　的舖戶，橫橫堅堅地擺下了十張以上的方桌子。汗流夾背的，幾乎聚下了五十多人，窒息氣充塞着整間舖戶了，然而，他們也一樣廢寢忘餐，勾心鬥角地去「戰」，爲肉體呢？還是爲靈魂」這，可不知道了。</p>
<p>統計，這是驚人底統計：香港和九龍半島的「麻雀天九出質」究竟有多少間？一千好了！最低限度，平均每間少設也有五副麻將，十副天九。每天租出去的，就五成吧！麻將總數爲二千五，總數爲五千；邊將，至少四人，天九，說不定，卽就四人論，以四乘之，打麻將的一萬人，打天九的二萬人。（——麻將館，還沒計在內）而這三萬人花在「賭」裏頭的「光陰」只好讓聰明的讀者去精密統計。</p>
<p>祖國在四野烽烟，前方將士在流血斷頭，在四萬萬五千萬人同罹浩刦底今日，凡屬中華兒女，人們有救亡的崗位，香港假定每天有這三萬人，在「四圈」「八圈」「十二圈」……的韶光來下來搶救祖國，祖國的情勢又如何呢？史蘭人靜時，在這驚人的統計底筆尖下，我們曾這樣地估重啊！</p>

<h3>華南地方要聞　奧工管處積極規劃　發展省營工業　召各廠長赴韶共商進行</h3>
<p>【曲江航訊】李漢魂接主省政後、對發展後方生產建設、悉力規劃、而於戰時工業之整理、尤為注意、特將工　處恢復、從此戰時工業之發展　該處遷抵粵北多日、記者十八日走訪張副處長仲新、叩詢各事、據談如下、</p>
<p>省營工業　過去情況</p>
<p>粵省省營工業「七七」抗戰展開後、×人不斷的力謀破壞、我爲支持長期抗戰，保持固有工業、在艱苦邊程中積極維持、及去年十月、×人發動華南戰事、廣州被×騎踏進後、省營工廠、迫得完全停頓、工營處亦於廣州淪陷後、先後遷往西江南路、正辦理結束中、適李主席囘主粵政、認爲工業關係戰時生產至大、亟宜乘時調整規復、特令本處由溪遷移粵北、根據戰時施政綱要建設部門、所定積極發展吾粵戰時工業、</p>
<p>全部發展　計劃已定</p>
<p>本處遷抵粵北後、對今後發展工業計劃、除遵照省府最近通過之戰時施政綱要建設部份實施外、并根據朱廳長嘯日出巡所得，實行扶植各地民營工業、歡迎華僑囘國投資、曁將沿海民營工廠、遷移內地、目前着手召集前省營各工廠廠長經理來韶、將過去工廠辦理情況、與應行整理事項、先作一總淸結　檢討已往、策勵將來、目前實爲一整理時期</p>
<p>人力物力　均所重視</p>
<p>今後所應注意者、爲財力人力原料運輸管理等五項問題、良以省營工業自遭×人摧殘後、生產停頓、資金無着、且負債甚多、首從財政方面言、有賴華僑投資及各方贊助者至切、二爲人力方面、如技術專門人才工人等、亦須設法羅致、三爲原料、因沿海被×封鎖後、原料來源、常有發生斷絕或不繼之虞、故今後內地工業必須找尋自出原料地方、以求自給自足、第四第五運輸管理兩項、亦不可忽視、蓋運輸不便、則出產物品、無由推銷、管理不善、亦足以妨碍整個計劃，本處對上述各大問題、現正從詳籌劃解决云</p>

<h3>British Indignation and American Government Concern</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army's brutal blockade of the Tianjin concessions and repeated imposition of embarrassing insults upon British people, the entire British nation has been extremely angry and is becoming increasingly agitated. This is a manifestation of the British people paying attention to the situation in the Far East and urging Britain to adopt a considerably strong policy to deal with Japan. On the other hand, the American ambassador to the Soviet Union recently notified Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the progress of British, Soviet, and French negotiations. This indicates that the American government not only hopes for the early success of the British-Soviet-French mutual assistance agreement but also that the United States itself has a close relationship with it and is willing to cooperate with Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to resist aggressors.</p>
<p>These facts indicate the importance of the Far East's position in the world's anti-aggression efforts. The British government urgently needs to directly and decisively follow this trend and move forward courageously. Before the atrocities of global aggressors, Britain is at the forefront, whether in Europe or the Far East. Britain must not only quickly accept and fight alongside the countries offering support but also give effective counterattacks to the aggressors without compromise. Britain has no reason or necessity to compromise or retreat in the face of aggressors' attacks, whether in Europe or the Far East. British retreat will only encourage aggressors to take advantage, and it will also weaken the cooperation of other democratic countries. If Britain wants to create a leadership position in the anti-aggression front, it must have this demeanor, and the Far East aggressor, Japan, will not dare to attack or bully her. Today, once a British-Soviet-French agreement is successfully concluded, Britain's leading position will be achieved. After the establishment of a British-Soviet-French agreement, there is no question about America's determination to join the anti-aggression struggle. With the United States backing Britain, Japan, which is currently bullying Britain the most, can somewhat reduce its arrogance. Because the strength and resources of the American navy are enough for Japan's hawkish military clique to deeply consider at all times. This is as Lord Beatty said in his long letter to "The Daily Telegraph" ("The Position of the British Navy in the Far East"): "Japan can obviously do everything possible to avoid infringing on the Philippines and strive not to infringe on American rights and interests, which can once again prove that naval power is above all else." It can be seen that the United States has a great role in preventing Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>Since the Tianjin incident, the British people's hope for the British government to complete the British-Soviet-French agreement as soon as possible has become more urgent. According to news from London, the main point of contention today is still the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states. "The Observer" believes on this point that the purpose of the Allied countries is to defeat German aggression. German aggression against the Baltic states will be indirect aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, regardless of whether the Baltic states are willing, the Allied countries will definitely protect them. They do so not for the sake of the Baltic states, but for the benefit of the Soviet Union, France, and Britain. At the same time, "The Sunday Times" also strongly advocated: "Britain must accept the Soviet Union's demands, that is, guarantee the small Baltic states," and said: "Whether the tripartite alliance can be established depends on the extent of British concessions to the Soviet Union." "The Observer" even said, "Regardless of whether the Baltic states agree, Britain must extend the scope of guarantees to the region." These are all reflections of the British people's anger. How the British government should respond is one of the major issues of the day.</p>
<h3>Main Mineral Deposits in Southwest Provinces</h3>
<p>— Chen Ligang</p>
<p>[Special Article from This Newspaper] The southwest is now the base for resisting Japan and building the nation. Its core includes Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang, and its outer perimeter includes Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Among these provinces, apart from Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei, which have relatively extensive alluvial plains with abundant rivers and lakes, the rest are continuous mountain ranges with high terrain. The geological strata have undergone significant changes, often suitable for the deposition of mineral beds. Therefore, the development of these inland provinces should focus on operating and exploiting mineral resources. Minerals are the mother of industrial development, and all construction and large-scale manufacturing materials required by industry are based on them. Therefore, in the 19th item of the government's program for resisting Japan and building the nation, it states, "...develop mineral resources, establish heavy industries, encourage the operation of light industries, and develop various handicrafts...", clearly stating the importance of developing mineral resources. Since the outbreak of the war against Japan, the entire country has deeply recognized the importance of building the southwest. Therefore, the government established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to manage affairs, and recently established the Southwest Economic Research Institute. Recently, the central government and the provinces have jointly established mining operations for tin in Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and mercury in Guizhou, which are actively underway. Even business circles, overseas Chinese groups, and private individuals are enthusiastically promoting development, preparing to invest heavily to supplement the government's efforts, in order to increase inland productive forces and lay the economic foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, regarding the main mineral deposits in each of the southwest provinces, which are suitable for investment and development, it is necessary to present the main mineral deposits so that those interested in investing and operating have a guideline. The author, being inadequate, will list the mineral resources based on what I have seen, for the correction of the readers, in order to arouse the close attention of the community and provide a reference for those concerned about investing in the inland.</p>
<p>Yunnan -- Yunnan is extremely rich in mineral resources, with gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and coal as the main resources. Gold is produced in the Jinsha River area, silver is produced in association with lead mines in Huize Xingfang, copper is produced in Dongchuan, Yuxi, Yongsheng, Jianshui, Huize, and other places, with Dongchuan as the production center; tin is particularly abundant, with Gejiu being the most productive, with an annual output of about 7,000 tons, second only to the Malay Peninsula; lead and zinc are produced in Huize, and coal and salt production is also abundant. Coal is produced in the north in Xuanliang, Zhengjiang, Songming, Kunming, Fumin, Kunyang, Chenggong, Tengyue, Yongchang, and the southern part of SiMao, Mile Luliang, Binchuan, Xiangyun, Tonghai, Xinxing, Ami, Zhenxiong, etc., with large output. Salt is produced in the central Dutong, Yuanmou, and Yanxing areas, with numerous salt wells. Precious stones and amber are produced in the west. The marble produced in Diancang Mountain has excellent texture. The copper, iron, and tin mining industries have rough scales, making it an important area for mineral resources in our border regions.</p>
<p>Guizhou -- Guizhou is known for its rich mineral resources, with mercury, copper, iron, coal, sulfur, and saltpeter as the main resources. The Fanjing Mountain in Tongren County, Baima Cave in Kaiyang County, Dadongla in Shengxi County, Nanmuchang in Tongzi County, Mercury Creek, and Xingyi are all famous mercury mines. The mercury reserves in more than 20 counties including Bazhai, Sanhe, Songtao, Wuchuan, Dejiang, Yinjiang, Jiangkou, Huangping, Anlong, Xifeng, Ceheng, Datang, Qianxi, Houping, Xingjiang, Ziyun, Changzhai, Sinan, Zunyi, and Xiuwen rank first in the country. Copper is produced in Weining, Dading, Zhi'an, and An'nan counties. Iron ore is abundant in Guiyang, Weining, and Longguo counties. Coal mines are produced between Dading, Zunyi, and Xifeng, Tongzi, Langdai, Zhijin, Bijie, Renhuai, Pingyue, Qianxi, Guiding, Guancen, Zhenning, Qingzhen, Longli, Anshun, and Guiyang.</p>
<p>Sichuan -- Sichuan's mineral resources mainly include coal, oil, salt, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. Coal and oil are produced in the central region, Qixian, Gulan, Zhongzhou, Hechuan, Xuanbin, Xuyong, Nanchuan, Guangyuan, and Anxian, with abundant coal reserves. Baxian, Yibin, Nanchuan and other counties produce the most coal. Oil is produced in Fushun, Pengxi, Renshou, and Zizhong counties. Salt is produced in Zigong and Gongjing, with thousands of salt wells and abundant output. Gold occurs in two forms: vein-shaped ore beds and placer deposits. Gold produced in Maogong and Mianning belongs to the former, and gold produced in the Yalong River and Jialing River belongs to the latter. Silver is produced in Tianquan and Lushan, copper is produced in Huali, Miyuan, Rongjing, and Pengxian, with abundant reserves. Iron is produced in Nanchuan, Qijiang, and Bei Pengshui counties. Lead and zinc are produced in Huali, and mercury is produced in the southeastern Youyang area.</p>
<p>Xikang -- Xikang is extremely rich in mineral resources, with gold mines being the most famous, produced in Kangding, Yalong River, Jiulong, Lihua, Dege and other counties. Other minerals such as silver, copper, iron, coal, saltpeter, sulfur, mica, and gypsum are abundant, but little is known due to incomplete surveys.</p>
<p>Guangdong -- Guangdong's mineral resources mainly include gold, iron, tungsten, manganese, coal, salt, and phosphorus. Gold is abundant in Zengcheng Guifeng Mountain, Enping and other places. Iron is produced in Ma On Shan in Hong Kong, Yunfu, Zijin, Lianjiang, Yingde and other counties. Tungsten is mostly produced in Wengyuan, Lechang, Heyuan, and Hong Kong. Manganese is produced on Hainan Island and in the Qinlian and Beijiang areas. Coal is mostly produced in Gaoming Ruyuan, Maoming, Shixing, Meixian, Qujiang, Longmen, Lechang, Hepu, and Qinzhou. Salt is abundant in coastal counties. Phosphate rock is produced on Hainan Island, and bird guano is produced in the Xisha Islands.</p>
<p>Guangxi -- Guangxi's mineral resources mainly include gold, tin, tungsten, manganese, antimony, lead, silver, coal, sulfur, and saltpeter. Gold mines are distributed in the Youjiang River basin in the southwest, in Tianyang, Tiandong, Xiangdu, Tianbao, in the east in Hezhou, Zhaoping, Mengshan, He County, Teng County, in the south in Nanning, Bobai, Rong County, and Guixian Binyang, with Shanglin, Wuming, and Cangwu counties having the richest reserves and output, followed by Tianyang, Teng County, and Zhaoping counties. Tin deposits are distributed in three areas: the Fuchuan, He County, and Zhongshan area in the east is rich, the Nandan and Hechi area in the north is the Danchi area, and the Bobai and Luchuan area in the south is the Bolu area, with the Hezhong area having the richest reserves and output, with more than 200 large and small mining companies and hundreds of thousands of workers, almost all of which are merchant organizations, with dozens of companies with hundreds of thousands of capital. The area of distribution and reserves in the Danchi area are not as good as in the Fuhezhong area, and there are only a dozen or so large and small companies without large-scale company organizations. As for the Bolu area, the reserves and output are relatively small, and only a few locals are mining there. The main producing areas of crane are Gongcheng, Binyang, and Zhongshan counties. There are more than ten tungsten industry organizations in the province, with Gongcheng and Fuyuan Company being the largest and most profitable. The main manganese producing areas are Wuxuan. Antimony is produced in more than ten counties including Hechi, Binyang, and Pingle. Iron ore deposits are distributed in Huai County, He County, Zhongdu, Sanjiang, Tianhe, and Heng County. Silver and lead mines are associated, mostly produced in more than ten counties including Wuxuan, Yongchun, and Guixian. Coal deposits are distributed in Qianjiang, Zhongshan, Tianyang, Nanning, Luocheng, and Xing'an counties, with the Heshan Coal Mine in Qianjiang and the Xixian Coal Mine in Zhongshan having the richest reserves. Sulfur is mostly extracted from pyrite, with Xing'an, Luocheng, Sile, and Mingjiang counties being the main producing areas. The main producing areas of saltpeter are Du'an Nama, Yinshan, and Luocheng.</p>
<p>Hunan Hunan's mineral resources are the most diverse, ranking first in South China, mainly including coal, antimony, lead, zinc, tin, gold, iron, tungsten, manganese, and gypsum. The distribution of coal deposits is very wide, from the Nanling Mountains to the Xiangtan area. The mines that have been mined are Gouyadong in Yizhang, Tanjia Mountain in Xiangtan, Fengguan Mountain in Xiangxiang, Huanggu Ridge in Qiyang, and Huangniutang. Xinhua, Shaoyang, Xiangxiang, Chenxian, Hengshan, Leiyang, Yongxing, Anhua, Xiangtan Changning, Baoqing, Ningxiang, Liling, and Yizhang are all famous coal producing areas. China's antimony ore is the richest in the world, accounting for 80% of the world's output, and Hunan Province produces a particularly large amount, accounting for more than 80% of the country's output. The main producing area is Xizhoushan in Xinhua and its vicinity, accounting for 75% of the province. The second is Yiyang, Anhua, Xupu, Yuanling, Yizhang, Dong'an, Wugang, Xinning, and Shaoyang, accounting for 25% in total. Lead and zinc are most abundant in Shuikoushan in Changning. The minerals produced there are silver-lead ore. In addition to producing lead and zinc, zinc ore also produces silver. Tin is abundant in Jianghua and Linwu. Jianghua has established a mining bureau to manage the mining. Gold is produced in Taoyuan, Qujiang, and Huitong. Iron ore reserves are very large, distributed in Yuanling, Anhua, Xinhua, Chaling, Ningxiang, Youxian, and Xiangxiang. The reserves and output of chicken are abundant, and the production areas are Yaogangxian in Zixing, Yanziling in Linwu, Xiangyunxian in Rucheng Qingdongshan in Guidong, Dengbuxian in Chaling and Lingchuantang in Liuxian. Manganese reserves are abundant, distributed in Shangwubu in Xiangtan, Changjiuchong, the Chunshui coast of Changning Leiyang, and Bawuling in Yueyang. Gypsum is produced in Xiangtan.</p>
<p>Hubei -- Hubei's mineral resources are mainly iron and coal. Copper ore gypsum, well salt are also abundant. Iron reserves are distributed in Tiemenkan, Shizishan in Daye; Shaomaochi, Xiangbishan, Jizishan in Lingxiang, Liudai Mountain and other places, Nancheng and Yidu. Among them, Daye Tieshan, Shizishan, Shaomaochi Mountain, Jijialu, and Xiangbishan have achieved good results. Coal reserves and output are very abundant, distributed and mined in the Yaxi Grand Canyon area of Xingshan, Chepu, Shizishan, Jigongshan, Pulongshan area of Puqi, Kuzhuqiao, Moshan area, and Shenshan. Ma'anshan in Wuchang, Tangxindazhi, between Echeng, the Shihuyao area of Daye and Changyang, Yidu and other counties. Among them, Wuchang Ma'anshan, Daye, Dalugou, and Tanwan in Yangxin have achieved good results. Copper reserves are also abundant, distributed in Niutoushan between Daye and Yangxin and the Jiangchun Town area of Daye. Gypsum and well salt are produced in Yingcheng, and mining has achieved early results.</p>
<p>Conclusion The above list is only the main mineral resources in the southwest. It is inevitable that one example is given to represent thousands. The author does not elaborate on a particular ore bed, nor does he intend to be all-inclusive. New ore beds are discovered from time to time. Here, a general example is given to see the general situation of mineral beds in the southwest. The detailed records of the mineral quality, ore bed, reserves, and output can be found in the publications and reports of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica, the seven geological surveys of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangdong, and the construction departments of each province for reference. In short, regarding the various mineral resources in the southwest, considering individual provinces, Yunnan can pay attention to tin, copper, and other mineral products. Guizhou has the most promising mercury. Sichuan has the richest reserves of coal, iron, oil, and salt. Xikang has the most abundant gold deposits. Guangxi's gold, tin, manganese, tungsten, and other metal minerals have the most value for mining, with the most abundant metal ores such as crane and tungsten. The antinomy coal, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, manganese, gypsum and other mineral resources in Hunan are worthy of attention. The coal, iron, gypsum, well salt in Hubei are capable of large-scale investment and development. Considering the entire southwest, metal is the main product. Minerals such as tungsten, antimony, tin, manganese, lead, zinc, bismuth, and mercury are particularly abundant, with tungsten accounting for more than 65% of the world's total output (Jiangxi produces the most) and antimony accounting for more than 80% of the world's total (Hunan produces the most). These raw materials are all necessary for the arms industry, distributed in the Nanling Mountains area, and its extended area includes southern Jiangxi, southern Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and extends into the Malay Peninsula. This is the Nanling metal ore belt. Therefore, developing the mineral resources of the southwest requires large-scale investment in the above-mentioned metal mineral categories, using technical management methods for mining, and both can obtain substantial profits.</p>

<h3>Our Military Strength Strengthened in Eastern Guangdong × Bombs Chao'an Attempting to Breach Han River Dam Fierce Battle in Jin Still at Stalemate</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shanghai, 26th] According to the French "Shanghai Daily," the Japanese army in China totals more than one million, including fifteen divisions in North China, fifteen divisions in Central China, fifteen divisions in Northeast China, and three divisions in South China, with each division having approximately 25,000 men. Approximately five divisions are stationed in Japan itself, allegedly to suppress popular resistance. Due to the war rate against China being trapped in difficulties, Japan may conscript new soldiers to make up fifty-two divisions. However, the new recruits have no experience in battle, so they are not suitable for actual combat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 26th] The Southern Pass (southeast of Pingyao) is attacked by ×. Now, more than two thousand reinforcements have come from Taigu Qixian, together with the original ×, totaling more than five thousand. Their main force has fallen into the ancient city of Quan Dian Town (north of Qin County). A part of them occupied Youbi (west of Yushe), and our unit rushed to reinforce it, and then recovered the ancient city and Youbi. On the 16th, 2,000 × from Quan Dian turned to the Jianjia Village area in the southwest and launched a fierce attack, and we are still in fierce battle.</p>
<p>Chaoshan Area</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] Delayed arrival. After × invaded Shantou, our × is now holding against each other across the Han River. Our military strength in eastern Guangdong has been increased.</p>
<p>[Urgent Dispatch from Dalu News Agency, Chao'an] On the 26th, × aircraft reconnoitered along the Chaoshan Railway and bombed Hecao, Fuyang, Wuyang, and Fengxi. According to military information, the railway line is developing clearly. × avoided Huamei (a neighboring station of Anbu) and detoured to attack Xintang due to the difficulty of combat near Anbu. It is still in fierce battle nearby. According to another piece of information, after × landed in Shantou, they had an intention to advance by land and sea. The land route advanced along the railway line, temporarily aiming at Chao'an. The water route took advantage of the rising water and went upstream along the tributary of the Jian River, threatening Heyang. Our army has been on strict guard separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanweng, 26th] In recent days, × aircraft have bombed various places southwest of Chao'an in batches, hoping to breach the embankment and flood the villages of refugees.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chao'an, 25th] The × on the Da'ao side were repeatedly attacked by us and confined to the Donghu coast, with no progress so far. On the Sijiwei side, our army is still guarding Chencun and Xincun. × launched several fierce attacks, all without success.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shao, 27th] According to semi-official news, a small squad of our Shantou garrison fought fiercely with × and all died heroically. The rest retreated to Xiaoling Mountain northeast of Shantou and echoed with our army in Anbu, 50 kilometers north of Shantou. × has been surrounded by us and cannot invade. It is heard that the commander-in-chief of a certain group army of ours has arrived in Chao'an to command the counter-offensive military affairs. Da'ao Island in southern Shantou is still in fierce battle. A certain high-level staff officer arrived in Shao from Shantou and talked about the fact that Shantou is easy to attack but difficult to defend. Shantou was once lost at 16:00 in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Today, × people have the help of warships and aircraft, which is even easier to obtain.</p>
<p>[Special News from Wengyuan] (1) The × in Meixi, north of Shantou, was surrounded by our army on the morning of the 24th and hundreds were killed. The rest are being annihilated. (2) At 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd, a joint force of × infantry, cavalry, and artillery, about seven or eight hundred people, advanced towards Xinli and Shenli. The attacking team of Peng's division of our 12th Group Army met and fiercely attacked them. After several hours of fierce fighting, × could not support them and collapsed and retreated along the original road. In this battle, more than one hundred × were killed, one head of × army officer Hua Liangjiashan was captured, and many rifles and ammunition were seized. Our army also injured three soldiers.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 26th] According to reports, after × landed in Shantou, they sent ships to peep at the ports of Shiqi Yangjiang and Beihai in southern Guangdong, posing as an advancing force. In fact, they want to lure our troops to the south so that the × in Jiangmen can invade to the west and break the stalemate of the past eight-star Hu Lai.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 26th) An × aircraft carrier has arrived in Tokyo Bay in the South China Sea and sent aircraft to bomb various places in Guizhou Province. On the 12th and 13th of this month, Nanning suffered fierce air raids, and many incendiary bombs were dropped in the commercial district of the city, causing heavy losses. However, there were not many casualties among the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaqing, 26th] At dawn on the 24th, five × warships were found downstream of Jiujiang, and they were driven to Shuangbing near the fort. Afterwards, they fired more than one hundred shells at the rocks, attempting to seize the opportunity to land. Our garrison firmly defended, and × did not succeed.</p>
<p>Various Guerrilla Areas</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 26th] Huang Zhentai's puppet army in Cangxian County, unable to withstand the oppression of the × army, took the opportunity to revolt on the 5th. Huang led more than 1,300 troops to a certain place to prepare to ambush the × army. The authorities, upon receiving the report, sent personnel to express their condolences and appointed the unit as the Second Guerrilla Detachment.</p>

According to a report from the Japanese side, only five soldiers were killed in the battle, and they confessed to seizing a light and heavy machine gun each, and automatic rifles, etc. According to a report from Nanjing City, the Nanjing-Hangzhou area striking team has started large-scale activities again. When the Japanese army and guerrillas fought near Yixing on the west bank of Taihu Lake, a Japanese brigade commander was killed.</p>
<h3>No Impact on Overseas Remittances After Fall of Shantou × Propaganda Lacks Common Sense A Conversation with a Financier in South China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shaoguan, 25th] When × invaded Shantou, they widely publicized that Shantou was the hub of overseas remittances, with as much as two hundred million yuan remitted into the city each year, so there was a need to invade. This was to cover up their ambition to drive out British and American commercial forces and militarily threaten Hong Kong. A Central News Agency reporter asked a South China financial authority about this matter. According to his discussion, such propaganda by × is nothing more than an attempt to deceive European and American people, weaken the world's understanding of their invasion of Shantou, and deceive overseas Chinese into cutting off the lives of their parents and wives, causing a blow to millions of overseas Chinese. The amount of overseas remittances into Shantou each year is 70 million yuan of currency. The Guangdong Provincial Bank now has branches in Chao'an, Meixian, Dapu, and Dapu, Songkou, and various important counties and cities in Guangdong and Jiangxi, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. The bank can also transfer remittances to other provinces. The Guangdong Provincial Bank has a well-known reputation. Remittances between Nanyang and the interior of the sparse province can be handled by the bank. Such uneducated propaganda by × only reveals its futile efforts.</p>
<h3>British Residents in Tianjin Severely Humiliated; Japanese Ignore Protests; Ironclad Facts Dismissed as Baseless Propaganda; Kidnapping, Robbery, and Arbitrary Actions by Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that the British "falsely accused" the Japanese army in Tianjin of insulting British residents and lodged a protest. This matter is still under investigation, and after this investigation is completed, the Japanese government will respond to the note presented by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. The Japanese claim that the insults to British residents are purely "baseless" propaganda. The "Asahi Shimbun" claims that British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems willing to believe any propaganda from the Chinese side and mistakenly believes that the British nation is superior to the Asian people, which is inappropriate. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" claims that some private radio stations in Tianjin broadcast unfounded news, which is enough to indicate that the British concessions in China are the center of anti-Japanese activities.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in the British Concession in Tianjin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that yesterday was the twelfth day of the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions. The important events of the day were: (1) The release of British resident Mr. Smith; (2) The supply of dairy products in the British concession was almost completely cut off; (3) White Russian "anti-communist" members paraded in the former German concession. Also, the day before yesterday, there was an incident of the most brutal search of British residents Mr. and Mrs. Fenler by the Japanese army. Mr. and Mrs. Fenler went to the Tianjin Country Club from the concession on Saturday afternoon. When they arrived at the Japanese military obstruction at the southern end of the racecourse, they were stopped by the Japanese army. Mr. and Mrs. Fenler waited for about an hour for inspection before being led into the inspection room. During the inspection of Mr. Fenler, he was completely naked, holding his coat, standing in front of Chinese and foreign people. His wife was led to an inner room, where a Chinese woman directed by a Japanese soldier performed the search. The inspector first ordered her to take off her hat and examined her hair, then ordered her to take off her clothes. Mrs. Fenler immediately asked the Japanese soldier to leave the room, but the Japanese soldier only turned his head to look elsewhere. After a few seconds, he turned his head back to look at Mrs. Fenler. Finally, Mrs. Fenler was forced to take off her undershirt, wearing only a corset, and the searcher reached into her clothes to inspect. The Japanese soldier standing beside her watched the entire inspection process. The door between the inner and outer rooms was not closed, and the Chinese and foreign people in the outer room could see everything clearly. The British people feel that the Japanese side has insulted them to this extent, so unless forced by duty, they do not easily risk passing through the Japanese military obstructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that this morning, two trucks departed from the British concession for use by the British army stationed in Tianjin. Ten minutes later, they returned to the British concession, but when they reached the intersection, they were detained by the Japanese army. The drivers of both trucks were wearing military uniforms, and a British military officer was sitting next to each driver. The British army reported the situation to British military commander Lieutenant Colonel Dalla, who went to the intersection to negotiate with the Japanese military officer. However, the Japanese military officer declined to meet him, claiming to be out. As a result, after fifty minutes of negotiation between the two sides, the two trucks were finally allowed to enter the concession.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the Japanese army blockading the British and French concessions is now also paying close attention to river traffic. Last week, all British steamships and barges traveling on the Hai River were ordered by the Japanese to dock at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for inspection. Each inspection often took several hours. During the inspection of a British resident on a tugboat, he was forced to take off his clothes and socks, and the 15 yuan of legal tender in his pocket was also confiscated. Also, two Chinese passengers were taken ashore and their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] A dispatch from Tianjin reports that the anti-British movement by the Japanese side is still very strong. Today at noon, about ten British and Soviet residents were greatly insulted by Japanese sentries and puppet soldiers at the entrance of the International Settlement. After about ten minutes of inspection, they were allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>Massacre by Japanese in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to an official announcement from the puppet "Manchukuo" in Changchun, 114 Chinese patriotic figures arrested in March last year have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five years to death. These patriotic figures were tried in the puppet High Court in Harbin. Ten were sentenced to death, and seven were sentenced to life imprisonment. The charges against them were "disturbing public order."</p>
<h3>Taunts of Chamberlain by Japanese in Qingdao; Demonstrations Carry Giant Statues of Chamberlain; Anti-British Movement by British Residents in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that some British residents arrived here from Qingdao today. According to them, during the recent anti-British movement in Qingdao, giant statues of Chamberlain were carried during the daily anti-British parades and demonstrations, holding umbrellas, to show their taunts. It is difficult for British ships to unload goods. Every time British ships hire workers to load goods, they are pulled to load Japanese ships instead.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 26th] Four days ago, Chinese people held anti-British demonstrations and parades in Qingdao, while parading the streets with portraits of British Prime Minister Chamberlain holding umbrellas as a joke. It is said that this kind of parade was initiated by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Further Restrictions by Japanese on Foreign Ships Sailing to Shantou; Barbed Wire Around British Wharf; Loading and Unloading of Goods Prohibited</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that on the 24th of this month, the authorities agreed that British merchant ships could freely enter and leave Shantou. However, the Japanese side suddenly claimed that only one British ship would be allowed to enter Shantou Port each week. The British naval authorities stated that the entry of British merchant ships into Shantou should not be subject to any restrictions. If necessary, British warships will escort them. Currently, the Japanese have set up barbed wire in Shantou to prevent British ships from loading and unloading goods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong] Although the Japanese army in Shantou agreed on Friday of last week to allow British ships to navigate to Shantou, there have been further complications. They have actually blockaded the British wharves, set up barbed wire around the British wharves, and sent sentries to monitor the British wharves. Anyone passing through the blockade line must be subjected to strict inspections and harassment. All goods are not allowed to be moved to the ships. Goods on the ships, except for mail and passenger luggage, are also not allowed to be unloaded. Although British ships navigating to Shantou are protected by British warships for entry and exit, it is difficult to restore normalcy in passenger and cargo transportation under this tense situation. The Japanese army's blockade of the British wharves will have a great impact on the supply of food to Hong Kong. Food prices in Hong Kong will inevitably continue to rise.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A dispatch from Shanghai reports that the British Consul General has protested to the Japanese Consul regarding the Japanese attempt to restrict British shipping in Shantou, stating that the British side cannot recognize the Japanese side's permission of only one British ship per week to sail to Shantou. If the Japanese side intends to interfere with British shipping, the British naval authorities have ordered the British warship "Slaney" to escort them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 26th] It is reported that the British military authorities insist on the right of British ships to sail to Shantou and will send warships to escort them if necessary. Although the Japanese authorities allowed British ships to sail freely to Shantou on the 24th, they have now notified the British side that only one British ship per week will be allowed to arrive in Shantou. The Japanese army has built obstacles around the warehouses in Shantou, preventing British ships in the port from loading and unloading goods.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan's Coffin Given Public Memorial in Xi'an; Jiang Dingwen and 30,000 Others Greet It Five Miles Outside the City; The Situation Was Enthusiastic, Unprecedented in Xi'an in Recent Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] Genghis Khan's coffin was moved south. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Military Affairs Commission specially dispatched commissioners Tang Jingran and Chu Mingshan to escort it. It departed from Yijin Horo of the Ikhao League on the 11th, arrived in Yulin on the 15th, and traveled south of Yulin on the 18th. The people of the counties along the way greeted and worshiped it enthusiastically. It arrived in Xianning on the evening of the 24th. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Xi'an lined up to greet it five miles outside the city. Provincial Chairman Jiang Dingwen, Deputy Dean of the Military Advisory Council Zhang, and civil servants of various agencies, students of various schools, and people from all walks of life, numbering more than 30,000, participated in the grand occasion, which was unprecedented. The coffin carriage departed from Xianyang at 5 p.m. on the 25th and arrived outside Xi'an at 6 p.m. The first carriage contained the divine spear "Sulde" and some sacrificial instruments. The divine spear was a sharp weapon used by the Great Khan for conquest. Today, the Mongolian people's respect for the divine spear is equal to that of the Great Khan. The second carriage contained the coffin of the Great Khan and his ancestral tablets, all in silver coffins. The third and fourth carriages were the special honor guard of the tomb guards and more than 40 members of the escort delegation sent by Jilin Tu, the sacrificial official of the tomb. The coffin carriage was decorated with national flags and red and yellow silk ribbons. When the carriage stopped, all circles immediately held a welcoming ceremony, presided over by Chairman Jiang Dingwen. After the ceremony, the coffin was moved, with the Daurhat cavalry escorting the spirit leading the way, followed by the full ceremonial guard and the band. The police and military police followed behind the carriage, and the guards and the welcoming people stretched for about seven miles. At 7 p.m., it entered the Anding Gate. Flags were decorated and road sacrifices were set up. The sound of firecrackers shook the sky, and tens of thousands of people lined the streets, vying to see it. The enthusiastic situation was unprecedented in Xi'an in recent years. At 8 p.m., the coffin arrived at the Visual Hall, and at 8:30 p.m., the sacrificial ceremony began. The chief sacrificial officer, Jiang Dingwen, and the accompanying sacrificial officers, Zhou Xinwan and more than 30 others, first held a public memorial service, with tributes from various agencies, groups, and schools. The ceremony was extremely grand and lasted until about 11 p.m. Chairman Jiang specially hosted a banquet on the evening of the 25th to entertain the Mongolian banner officials who had come to escort the coffin.</p>
<h3>British and Japanese Continue to Negotiate Tianjin Blockade Issue</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Yesterday, political circles here confirmed the news reported by the British newspapers regarding the meeting between the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mamoru Shigemitsu, and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, and stated that the British Foreign Secretary's protest against the Japanese's hostility towards British residents in Tianjin was indeed true. It was further stated that the two diplomats discussed the issue of lifting the blockade of the concessions during the meeting. At the same time, the British Foreign Secretary hinted to the Japanese Ambassador that if the Japanese do not repent, the British will take retaliatory measures. Political circles also stated that Japan certainly wants to hold negotiations with the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom must remain strictly neutral towards the Sino-Japanese War at any time, and at the same time, it must recognize the new order in North China after the establishment of the puppet government in Peiping. If the United Kingdom actually takes retaliatory measures, Japan will consider that the United Kingdom no longer hopes that Japan will consider British interests in China.</p>
<h3>Unified Enrollment for the 28th Academic Year; Ministry of Education Announces Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] In order to adapt to the special environment and needs of the war of resistance and to coordinate the enrollment of national universities, the Ministry of Education held unified enrollment for national colleges and universities last year, and the results were quite satisfactory. In the 28th academic year, first-year freshmen (excluding specialized students) of national universities and independent colleges will still be enrolled by the Ministry of Education. After admission, they will be assigned to national colleges and universities. Enrollment for provincial private universities and independent colleges and public and private specialized schools will still be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before they can enroll students on their own. The members of the Unified Enrollment Committee for National Schools for the 28th academic year have been appointed and hired by the Ministry of Education, including Luo Jialun, Wang Xinggong, Gan Tianfang, Qi Fang, Ye Yuanlong, Wu Nanxuan, Tong Guanxian, Xie Xunchu, Zhang Yi, Wu Junsheng, Chen Lijiang, Hao Gengsheng, Huang Longguang, and others, totaling 19 people. Wu Junsheng was designated as the chairman of the committee. This year's unified enrollment will be divided into 15 enrollment areas: Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Guilin, Yanping, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Zhenping, and others. Branches will be established in Hechuan, Baisha, Leshan, Wugong, Ankang, Tongren, Lantian, Hong Kong, and other places. The registration date is set from July 25th to 30th, and the examination date is set from August 7th to 10th. The unified enrollment methods for this year differ from those of last year in the following aspects: (1) The examination questions for this year will be uniformly formulated and issued by the Ministry of Education; (2) In addition to using aspirations and grades as the distribution standards for students, this year, priority will be given to distribution in the examination area and nearby schools. If the quotas of each school in the area are full, or if there are no desired departments, the school will be designated by the Ministry; (3) Students who are not admitted but whose grades are not too poor will be admitted by the Ministry to the university preparatory class; (4) Students who are exempted from the entrance examination are limited to the current year's graduates of middle schools who have passed the graduation examination and are recommended by the provincial education departments for their outstanding performance (the top 10%). National middle schools and provinces that have not held the examination shall not follow the example of recommending students; (5) The number of students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications shall not exceed 10% of the total number of students admitted in each district and shall be limited to the top half of the total number of students admitted in each district.</p>
<h3>Tension in Fujian Sea; Japanese Warships Increase to Eight; We Are Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] Six more warships have sailed into the waters outside the Min River estuary, bringing the total to eight, including two transport ships, two cruisers, and two destroyers. We are closely monitoring them.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Shantou; An Eyewitness Account of the Japanese Plundering of Shantou</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Lin Gao (1)</p>
<p>On the 21st, before five o'clock in the morning, the air raid alarm sounded, and many people were awakened from their sleep. It was not yet light, and the stars were twinkling in the gaps in the clouds.</p>
<p>The faint sunlight slowly increased, and eleven Japanese seaplanes dispersed and flew low over the city. Farmers in the suburbs, carrying heavy loads of vegetables, hurried to the market. The air raid did not disrupt the lives of the city's residents.</p>
<p>It was past seven o'clock when news came that the Japanese were going to land on the coast outside the port. Since the urban area is only thirty miles from the port, since the beginning of the war of resistance, the Japanese have repeatedly used speedboats to approach the shore. Once our army opened fire, they would flee. In June alone, the Japanese had made such moves on three large scales with dozens of speedboats at the same time, and had even opened fire for tens of minutes. There were mines blocking the sea at the harbor entrance and fortifications of the defense army on the land from the sea to the urban area. Without hearing the sound of Japanese cannons or the sound of the defense army's guns, the landing could not be confirmed. It was thought that this was just another Japanese harassment. If the Japanese really landed, the "evacuation alarm" would sound continuously for five minutes, and it would not be too late to escape then.</p>
<p>On the street, there was a continuous stream of vendors selling mugwort leaves, "Sheganzi flowers," palm balls, cool powder palm, and other festival items. People were preparing for the festival. The Japanese planes had been flying for so long, a vicious bombing was inevitable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Prisoner of War in Northern Hunan</h3>
<p>— Peng Hepu</p>
<p>[Special Correspondence from the Central News Agency] Recently, our army captured two Japanese soldiers alive, and the process was quite interesting. After the Japanese invaders expanded into Yuezhou and Linxiang, they never had a peaceful sleep. Not only were railways and highways repeatedly destroyed, and military depots and grain stations burned down, but they were also often subjected to sudden attacks. Even though they were vigilant and heavily guarded, our guerrillas appeared and disappeared unpredictably, making defense impossible. In particular, the telephone lines behind the Japanese army often disappeared for miles. As soon as they were set up, we would come back fully loaded with three or five bundles, which only exhausted the Japanese communication soldiers, leaving them at a loss and complaining endlessly.</p>
<p>When the battle north of the Xinqiang River was in full swing, the power lines between Yanglousi and Pingshuipu were suddenly cut off again. The Japanese, in desperation, came up with a trick. They sent an interpreter disguised as a villager to investigate the matter and find a way to thoroughly prevent it, while also observing our military situation. This guy, carrying out his mission, went from Yuezhou and arrived at Pingshuipu on the 30th. The next morning, he unloaded his "Imperial Army" uniform, disguised himself as a villager, and was outwardly indistinguishable from a Japanese soldier. Moreover, he could speak Chinese. He was accompanied by a local puppet policeman, and two Japanese military police provided remote protection.</p>
<p>South of the railway, the fields crisscrossed. In past years, it was the busy farming season, with rice-planting songs everywhere. The farmers were so carefree, but this beautiful life had been shattered. The brutal Japanese invaders had destroyed their homes and fields, leaving only desolation. Facing them were three ragged villagers. The guy thought to himself that he could get some information from them, and he couldn't help but be delighted. But as he approached to inquire, the three villagers exchanged glances and quickly seized him and the puppet policeman. To put it bluntly, it was simply a kidnapping. The location was only 300 meters from the Japanese military police on the side of the road, and the three warriors only had a few grenades.</p>
<p>The prisoner was short in stature but had a fierce face. I guessed he was not a genuine Japanese soldier. Later, when I interrogated him, I found out that he was indeed Taiwanese. His name was Chen Songquan (also known as Matsuda Tatsuo), born in Nishichō, Keelung. He had studied at Quanzhang Middle School in Shanghai for five years. Later, he returned to Taiwan to do business. On November 16 of last year, he was drafted into the Shanghai Kiucheong Road Japanese special agency as an interpreter. On February 16 of this year, he was transferred to the Ninth Division Headquarters of the Central China Dispatch Army as an interpreter officer. His rank was eighth grade. He was originally stationed in Pu Zhe and came to Yuezhou with Commander Yoshizumi on May 18. He is currently 34 years old and has a wife and three children at home.</p>
<p>I handed him a cigarette, and he was overjoyed. When asked about the losses of the Japanese southward invasion, he admitted that the battles of Caoxieling and Gengkouchong were the most devastating. The four field hospitals are now full of wounded soldiers, totaling about 2,000. From euphemisms such as "Maintenance Committee," "Refugee Area," "Comfort Station," and the disguised brothel "Canteen," he unintentionally revealed that Yuezhou City was full of evil atmosphere, and the men and women who had not escaped were living a ghost-like life, being ravaged and humiliated in their dilapidated homes. It is truly a feeling of seeing familiar scenery and mountains and rivers everywhere!</p>
<p>The war-weariness of the Japanese army can be seen from the homesickness of the soldiers. Although they know that they are fighting an unjust war, they dare not openly oppose the war for the sake of obeying the emperor's orders. For example, after I was drafted, I had to reluctantly close my business immediately, because failing to report within 24 hours would result in "execution." He sighed endlessly. He said that the Japanese government in Taiwan usually levies heavy taxes, and since the invasion of China, it has added many "imperial army consolation" donations, which has increased the burden on the people. Under high pressure, there are still revolutionary undercurrents. The fact that Taiwanese are exempt from military service is why the Japanese are uneasy.</p>
<p>When talking about the puppet army, he was completely unaware. Later, he told me, "Yes, those are just Japanese soldiers who deliberately grow beards to imitate Mongolians and carry out brutal acts." This despicable trick to provoke animosity between our nationalities is both shameful and ridiculous. Mentioning our heroic air force and its expedition to Taiwan last year, he still had lingering fears. When Chinese planes suddenly arrived in the sky, the loud explosions of bombs shook the heavens and the earth, and terror enveloped the entire island. It is said that the losses were heavy, but the authorities kept it secret, and the general public believed that the airport must have suffered a great loss without any preparation.</p>
<p>Japanese war correspondents all follow the headquarters. "Currently, there are special correspondents from the Asahi Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun in the Yuezhou area, but telegrams must be reviewed by the staff department before they can be sent out. Unfavorable news will be suppressed." From this, we can know how the Japanese warlords are deceiving the world. Chen also recounted that his ancestors were originally from Zhangzhou, Fujian, and moved to Taiwan for trade. "My father sent me to Shanghai to study, which was to prepare me to work in China. After my father died and I returned to Taiwan, the Japanese did not allow me to come to China again."</p>
<p>Below are his thoughts written in Chinese, which are reproduced verbatim without any changes: "The prisoner only awaits death, not knowing that your country is benevolent and compassionate. Not only is he not put to death, but he is also treated generously, truly a land of benevolent people. If, at the time of peaceful resolution between the two sides, I can be pardoned and released to return to Taiwan, it would be a virtue of rebirth. If you do not abandon my inferior talent and there is a position to be assigned, I would dare not disobey and would repay your kindness with gratitude!" (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Moscow Confirms Mongol-Manchurian Border Conflict: Intense Battles Involving Land and Air Forces, Repeated Japanese-Manchurian Offensives Meet Fierce Resistance</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch) According to a military expert stationed in Hong Kong who spoke to our reporter, the recent Mongol-Manchurian border conflict was entirely a Japanese provocation. The purpose is twofold: (1) to create a new stimulus for the Japanese people, in order to divert their general dissatisfaction with domestic hardships and the war of aggression against China; (2) after two years of Japanese aggression against China, there have been heavy casualties among soldiers. Recently, Tokyo planned to transfer the Kwantung Army southward to participate in the war of aggression against China, but the Kwantung Army opposed this move. Therefore, they created a border incident as a check.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, June 26th (Report from this newspaper)] According to a telegram from Vladivostok, the recent Japanese-Soviet conflict on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border was initiated by the Japanese military to test the strength of Soviet defenses, and thus they challenged the Soviets. The latest challenge took place near Lake Baikal. Currently, the strength of the Outer Mongolian army is 180,000 men, most of whom are concentrated on the southeastern border. The Mongol 6th Division participated in this battle, including two infantry brigades, a mechanized unit, and another mechanized unit, equipped with 300 armored vehicles and 400 tanks, concentrated on the west bank of the Khalkhin Gol River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, June 25th] Regarding the large-scale land and air force conflicts that have occurred for the past month on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchuria," official circles have now issued a public statement confirming them. It is also stated that between the 22nd and 24th of this month, a total of 56 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft were shot down, while the Soviet and Outer Mongolian side only lost 14 aircraft.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, June 26th] A communiqué has just been issued here, describing the fierce air and land battles that have taken place along the Outer Mongolian and Manchurian border over the past month. The communiqué concludes by saying that the Soviet and Outer Mongolian armies have now completely occupied all key points east of the Khalkhin Gol River along the Manchurian border.</p>
<p>Soviet Official Report</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Moscow, June 26th, TASS) TASS has just released an official report stating that since May 15th, some foreign newspapers, based on incorrect reports from the Kwantung Army Headquarters, have widely published news of conflicts between the Outer Mongolian army and the Japanese-"Manchurian" army. Japanese newspapers have consistently lied, claiming that such conflicts were caused by Mongolian troops invading Manchurian territory. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have brazenly exaggerated that their land and air forces have suffered "extreme" losses. According to information received by the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Command, TASS provides the following truthful information regarding the events that occurred on the Manchurian-Mongolian border. The truth about the events that occurred in the Lake Baikal area of the Manchurian border is as follows: On May 11th, a border post in the Mongolian-Mahkanpu-Obo area of Outer Mongolia (located southeast of Lake Baikal, 16 to 20 kilometers east of the Khalkhin Gol River) was suddenly attacked by Japanese and Manchurian troops and forced to retreat westward from the border to the banks of the Khalkhin Gol River. Since May 12th, border conflicts have occurred there almost every day for ten days, resulting in casualties on both sides. On May 12th, Japanese-"Manchurian" reinforcements arrived and attempted to attack the Mongolian army and vainly tried to invade Mongolian territory, but they were repulsed outside the border with heavy losses. On May 28th and 29th, the Japanese-"Manchurian" army again received a large number of Japanese reinforcements from Hailar, equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and a large air force, and invaded Mongolian territory again. The Mongolian army, which arrived at the scene of the conflict, searched for the invaders and dispersed them. The Japanese-"Manchurian" army abandoned many dead and wounded soldiers and a large number of weapons on the battlefield, fleeing back to its own territory in a panic. In this battle, the Japanese-"Manchurian" army suffered more than 400 deaths, while the Mongolian army only suffered 40 deaths and 70 injuries. Three Japanese military headquarters were destroyed, one of which was the detachment headquarters commanded by Dongwu. In these destroyed Japanese military headquarters, many documents were found, including a definitive order issued by the commander of the Japanese 23rd Division in Hailar on May 21st. In his order, he declared to his unit, "This division must use its own forces alone to destroy the Outer Mongolian army in the Khalkhin Gol area." In addition to the land conflict, air conflicts also occurred. On May 28th, a squadron of Japanese fighters and bombers invaded the border and suddenly attacked two Mongolian airfields. Soviet-Mongolian fighters took off late due to being caught off guard, which put the Japanese aircraft in a favorable position. In this air battle, the Soviet-Mongolian air force lost nine aircraft, while the Japanese side lost three. In the end, the Japanese aircraft were forced to flee back to their base in haste. On June 22nd, the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force dispatched 120 aircraft to launch a new offensive. The Soviet-Mongolian air force engaged them with 95 aircraft. 31 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft were shot down, and 12 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down. On June 24th, the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force invaded again, this time with 60 aircraft. The Soviet-Mongolian army also dispatched 60 aircraft to engage them, and shot down another 25 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft. In this air battle, the Soviet-Mongolian aircraft only lost two aircraft. On June 25th, there were no incidents on the border between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria. The Soviet army occupied the entire Khalkhin Gol River. Throughout the conflict, the Soviet-Mongolian army never violated the established border, except when the Soviet-Mongolian air force had to enter Manchurian airspace while pursuing the Japanese-"Manchurian" air force. This was an extremely rare exception.</p>
<p>Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, June 26th] Today's newspapers here claim that in the air battles on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border since June 20th, 133 Soviet aircraft were shot down. They also claim that yesterday 14 Soviet aircraft were intercepted by Japanese fighters, resulting in three being shot down. The location of the battle was in the airspace near Lake Baikal. It is claimed that a major battle took place there on June 22nd.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, June 26th] According to opinions from political circles here, Japan believes that the recent repeated incidents on the Manchurian border are not isolated events, but a planned action instigated by Moscow. Japanese political circles also claim that this action is a planned effort to aid Chiang Kai-shek, intending to restrain the powerful Japanese army on the western border of "Manchukuo" and prevent it from being transferred elsewhere. Japanese newspapers warned the Soviet Union that Japan's strength is very powerful and that the Soviet Union should not underestimate it and should avoid further incidents, because the "Manchukuo" army can no longer tolerate this situation. Some Japanese newspapers have also called on the government to lodge a strong protest directly with Moscow.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Stalled: Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons, Strang Remains Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax hopes to send further instructions to Special Envoy Strang, who is currently in Moscow, soon. The British government is currently consulting with the French government to consider the Soviet Union's assessment of the recent Anglo-French proposals. I do not believe that sending a cabinet member to the Soviet Union, as suggested by Member of Parliament Tildon, would be of any benefit. Tildon once said that the difficulties in Anglo-Soviet negotiations are very pleasing to Berlin, which will further increase the danger of new German aggression and European war. This may be an accurate fact, and I hope the Soviet government shares this view. Subsequently, someone questioned the Prime Minister and asked him to report on the progress of the talks with the French government. Chamberlain replied, "I am not prepared to release the detailed situation."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, June 25th] Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, came here to assist British Ambassador Seeds in conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities to conclude an Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. It has been twelve days since then, and negotiations have never been interrupted. The British and French representatives have presented two different proposals to Molotov, both of which the Soviet government found unsatisfactory. According to well-informed sources, the British and French ambassadors are about to receive new instructions to present a third proposal to the Soviet government. Personally, Strang does not express any urgency regarding the stagnation of the tripartite negotiations. He repeatedly used the excuse that the time was not ripe to answer questions from reporters and refused to answer. Therefore, no one knows the obstacles to the proposals he submitted to the British government. However, the British side here generally believes that Strang has conducted a thorough study of what the government intends and is rumored to advocate accepting the Soviet side's demands. Even if Britain refuses to provide guarantees to the Baltic countries, the three countries of Britain and France may form an agreement with the three signatory countries themselves as the scope. However, this aspect may not contribute to the movement to form a peace group to resist aggression everywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, June 26th] The foreign affairs correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" commented on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in an article published in the newspaper today. This comment seems to represent the views of the British Foreign Office. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that the British Foreign Office received a telegram and detailed report from British Ambassador Seeds stationed in the Soviet Union yesterday. It is reported that the British Ambassador listed in the report the points on which British and Soviet opinions still disagree and expressed his personal opinions on the rapid completion of this negotiation. People generally believe that the Cabinet will base its research on the report and then submit new instructions to Ambassador Seeds. The "Daily Telegraph" foreign affairs correspondent said that British Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union advised the government to make some concessions to the Soviet Union. The newspaper said that the British and French representatives in Moscow believe that if the British and French governments accept the suggestions made in Ambassador Seeds' report, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will eventually succeed. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Cabinet will reopen today to discuss Ambassador Seeds' report.</p>
<h3>Romania Denies Conclusion of Mutual Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, June 26th] Semi-official sources here have strongly denied rumors that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is preparing to conclude a new Balkan mutual defense agreement. The purpose of Gafencu's recent visits to Ankara and Athens has already been published in a communiqué, clearly stating.</p>
<h3>Spanish Restoration?</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, June 25th] Regarding the issue of the Spanish restoration, a visitor from Spain replied to a reporter's question, saying that since the volunteer soldiers from Germany and Italy withdrew from Spain, the possibility of a restoration has greatly increased. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army, often tells people that his belief in monarchical politics has not disappeared and that he firmly believes that Spain can only unify all parties and factions and maintain independence in diplomacy by implementing a restoration. Based on this, on July 18th, the third anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, there may be an important upheaval in the Spanish political system, which is not certain. As for who will ascend to the throne after the restoration of Spain, Prince Don Juan, the son of the deposed King Alfonso (abdicated on April 15, 1938), has the greatest hope. However, there is also talk of Alfonso himself reassuming the throne. In addition, the majority of Spaniards oppose the establishment of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, saying that Spain's military strength is not comparable to that of the Axis powers. If it concludes an alliance treaty with these countries, it will inevitably be completely controlled by them.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports: Tianjin Situation Still Undeveloped, Members of Parliament Raise Questions One After Another, British Public Opinion Increasingly Indignant</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 26th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons today, "There is no change in the general situation in Tianjin. Only one-tenth or two-tenths of the usual amount of perishable food and vegetables is reaching Tianjin, and the supply is intermittent. Tugboats on the Hai River must be inspected, which causes obstruction. The local municipal staff and military authorities are paying attention to the food issue at all times and have the right to take appropriate measures. Few British expatriates are using obstacles to defend themselves, but some insults have occurred, which is regrettable. Foreign Secretary Halifax has protested to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain in the strongest terms, and the British Ambassador to Japan has also made the same representations to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita when discussing the overall situation in Tianjin. I have some reason to hope that this conversation will resolve the Tianjin incident, so although I insist that the abuse of British expatriates must be stopped, I am still unwilling to make any statements that would prevent a satisfactory resolution of the dispute with the Japanese government." Chamberlain also answered questions from Members of Parliament Asquith and Henderson, "Although the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have made extensive demands, the Japanese government has not made formal demands." Former Foreign Secretary Eden also asked the Prime Minister whether the current hope for resolving the Tianjin incident is better because of the hope gained after negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo, and reminded him that "What Tokyo promises cannot always be fulfilled." The Prime Minister replied, "I am well aware of this. The hope I expressed was obtained after negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo. I hope the Japanese government can restrain its subordinates in Tianjin." Waldlau and Milner questioned, "Will the Prime Minister's tolerance and protective policy be misunderstood in the Far East, as it was in Germany? This is an extremely serious danger." He replied, "Everything is already in my consideration."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 25th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has learned that London officials are paying close attention to the increasing indignation of the British public over the continuous malicious abuse of British expatriates in Tianjin by the Japanese military. It is expected that if the British proposal to Tokyo to frankly discuss the main points of the problem and the evolution of the incident (which Chamberlain regarded as intolerable) cannot obtain a satisfactory response, the British people's public anger will inevitably affect the government's attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 26th] The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting tonight to discuss the Tianjin situation. It is expected that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie will soon send a report to the British government on the attitude of the Japanese government. Regarding the saying that the British Navy is preparing to hold a demonstration exercise in the Far East, the necessary ships are easy to obtain, but it seems that sending a large force is still problematic. The "Economic Times" stated, "What is the British government thinking and hoping to gain from procrastination? The world is now paying attention to the dispute in the Far East. If we cannot adhere to our inherent position, British prestige will suffer a serious blow. If we want to restore our prestige, it will be impossible. The time for compromise is now past."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 26th] The Times said in an editorial today that it hopes Germany and Japan will listen to Prime Minister Chamberlain's words. The article stated, "Chamberlain has made it clear that Britain will not listen to foreign commands and change its Far Eastern policy. He still hopes that the Japanese government does not intend to condone the excessive behavior of its soldiers, but in any case, the British government cannot tolerate and fail to take appropriate retaliation for the bad and insulting treatment of British expatriates in foreign territories."</p>
<h3>Goebbels' Mad Barking: Bitterly Ridicules British Policy, Leader of German Government's Labor Party Also Gives Speech Insulting Britain</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Cologne, June 25th, issued at this country's National Socialist Party conference) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech targeting yesterday's speech by Chamberlain in Cardiff. His words said, "We do not need London's promises, but the expression of concrete facts. In the autumn of the crisis in the international situation, we will risk everything and follow the government. For example, a person who does not take risks will never win. We will not care about the British government's threats, because their threats do not have the strength to back them up. The Japanese army forced the British to undergo naked inspections, but the British government could do nothing. The troops of the German Emperor and the German nation were once defeated, but this is a past fact that cannot be repeated."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, June 25th] German Labor Party leader Erich discussed the reason for "Britain's suffering of insults in Tianjin" in front of 16,000 political leaders in Potsdam today. Erich said, "No matter from which aspect we observe this world empire, we can only discover the facts of failure. If Britain had not rejected the German leader's invitation to unite with Germany, it would not have fallen into its current situation. The suffering of the blockade that Britain is currently experiencing in Tianjin is no different in nature from its previous treatment of Germany, and the insults suffered by Britain are even worse. The current issue is not the monotony of trivial details in the Far East, but the entire humiliation that Britain must endure."</p>

<h3>"Blood Donation Week"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from Paris stated that France is holding a "Blood Donation Week" this week. President Lebrun will personally visit various blood transfusion research institutes to observe blood transfusion equipment and give a speech explaining the importance of blood transfusion work in wartime, encouraging people to voluntarily register with doctors and test their blood so that it can be used for soldiers' blood transfusions in the event of a war. The French government cares for its soldiers and plans ahead in this way—in contrast, our country, millions of heroic soldiers, have been fighting for two years, and those who have generously sacrificed themselves have left behind tens of millions of family members who urgently need assistance, and those who have been tragically killed and injured are moaning on the front lines and urgently need to be rescued. Those engaged in national salvation work active in the war zone, behind enemy lines, are not only lacking spiritual and material support, but are also inevitably subjected to various harms from traitors, stubborn elements, and even local evil forces—look at others! Even if we cannot donate blood, we should at least seek peace of mind and provide assistance to these heroic soldiers who are fighting for the country to the best of our ability!</p>
<p>Uprightness</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and others are committing the crime of deceiving the people and betraying the country in the name of "peace, anti-communism, and national salvation," which not only violates the interests of the Chinese nation, but also violates the moral concepts that have been passed down among the Chinese people for thousands of years. Therefore, whether in the front lines, behind the lines, at home, overseas, or even among international people of justice, all have expressed hatred and contempt. Mr. Liang Shennan of Ipoh recently publicly announced in a newspaper that he was resigning from his position as director and withdrawing from shareholder relations because the newspaper echoed Wang's rebellious remarks; at the same time, Mr. Liang Kuanzhong also published a formal statement because his translation of "The Recent Naval Strength of the Great Powers" was published in the "Era Anthology" alongside traitorous articles by Wang Jingwei, denouncing the illegal actions of the publication; and Hong Kong's Siwei Company also solemnly declared that it would "never recognize" Wang's newspaper because it was unwilling to have its advertisements placed in it; yesterday, newspapers also published announcements from overseas Chinese groups in Malaya protecting the National Government and ordering the arrest of Wang Ming, and newspapers in Poland and the Netherlands also unanimously and fiercely criticized Wang for his heinous crimes. When we see these facts, we feel all the more that "justice lies in the hearts of the people" and that uprightness is inviolable! I wonder if the general shameless opportunists and those who speak in the words of traitors dare to face this squarely!</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Collecting Debts</h3>
<p>Do you owe someone a dollar?</p>
<p>My friend Major Du owes me a dollar. It has been twelve months now, and I'm afraid there's little hope of getting it back. Every time I meet him, I remember that he has forgotten he owes me a dollar. When he meets me, he still has that frank and sincere attitude, he has completely forgotten about my dollar, and I know I will never get that dollar back.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I will remember all my life that Major Du owes me a dollar. I believe it will not hinder our friendship in any way, but I will never forget this matter. I don't know how others are, but if someone borrows a dollar from me, I always remember it firmly, remembering it until I enter the grave.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the story. On April 8th last year—I specially write the date because Major Du may see this article—Major Du was going to Ba Tai and borrowed this dollar from me. At that time, he needed a dollar for pocket money to rent a car, so I lent it to him. The matter happened simply and naturally, and it was not until after the matter was over that I felt a little that he just said, "Give me a dollar, okay?" I said, "Sure, is one dollar enough?" I knew that when Major Du took that dollar, he originally intended to return it.</p>
<p>He sent me a letter from Ba Tai. I thought when I opened the letter, the dollar must be inside. But it wasn't. He only said that the temperature was close to one hundred degrees. I don't know if he meant that he was so dizzy from the heat that he even forgot that he owed me a dollar.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, Major Du came back. I went to the train station to pick him up—not because of the dollar, but because I really looked up to him. I thought that after he came back after three weeks, he would be very happy to see someone picking him up at the station. I specially said, "Let's rent a car to go to the club." But he replied, "No, let's walk."</p>
<p>That night, we were together all the time. Watching Ba Tai. I thought of that dollar at the time, but of course I didn't mention it. How could I mention it! I asked him what currency system was used in Ba Tai, and whether the market price was the same as American silver dollars—I deliberately said American silver dollars a little louder—but in the end, I still couldn't make him remember that dollar.</p>
<p>Soon after, I met Major Du at the club almost every day—I realized that he had completely forgotten about that dollar. One day, I asked him how much travel expenses he spent this time, and he said he didn't keep accounts. Later, I asked him whether he could settle down and live a stable life, and he avoided the question, so I knew it was all over.</p>
<p>I don't hold any grudges against Major Du. I just added him to the list of people who owe me a dollar and forget to return it. There are already quite a few people on the list now. My attitude towards them has not changed. I just hope I can forget about it.</p>
<p>I often meet Major Du. The night before yesterday, I met him while eating. He naturally talked about Poland. He said that Poland would never repay the debt it owed. You always think that this kind of thing would remind him of owing money, right? But it doesn't.</p>
<p>However, at this time, a rather painful thought often comes to my mind. I think, if Major Du owes me a dollar and forgets about it, then theoretically speaking, I should also have the possibility of owing someone a dollar and forgetting about it. Maybe someone also has a list to write down. The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel, because if I forget that I borrowed a dollar from someone, I will never repay it in my whole life.</p>
<p>To those who have ever lent me money in the world, I hope they will speak up, not all at once, but in parts, preferably in alphabetical order. I will immediately write their names on paper, but I have to declare that I don't include those who lent me a dollar when playing poker, and I don't even think about—I deliberately don't think about—the person who lent me thirty cents to buy soda at the sports club last month. But if someone lends me a dollar to pay for a car when I want to go to Ba Tai, I will definitely return that dollar to him.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I want to launch a big movement, a movement to "restore honesty," to get everyone to pay back the money they borrowed. We must remember that the most powerful countries are built on the foundation of absolute honesty.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask the readers not to throw this newspaper away randomly, lest it be seen by Major Du at the University Club. However, if he really sees it and is willing to return the dollar he owes me, then I would also like to thank the person who threw this newspaper away.</p>
<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Japanese side announced that in the border area of ​​Manchukuo, they had an air battle with the Soviet Union and shot down 49 Soviet warplanes. The Soviet side denounced it as absurd and not worth a laugh. Now the Soviet communiqué has come out. Fifty-six Japanese planes were shot down. I wonder if the Japanese side will also say that nothing happened. This may be the advertising technique of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Speaking of advertising, I was still saying the day before yesterday that Hong Kong people don't know how to do it. But the color is coming. A female guide actually falsely reported a theft and hoped to see her name in the newspaper. What a skill. Oh dear, I said it, and I'm actually advertising for her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were two things in Hong Kong that you can't help but pay attention to. First, the Japanese will run an English newspaper in Hong Kong, investing 260,000 yuan. Second, the secretary of the Japanese consul was taking pictures in the military area.</p>
<p>The epidemic in Hong Kong seems to be quite fierce, but the prevention work doesn't seem to be very good. Many citizens and students have not yet received vaccinations. And the procedure for going to Macau to get vaccinated costs as much as two yuan. This seems to be worth considering and discussing.</p>
<h3>One Person a Day</h3>
<p>Everyone should also remember that not long ago, Goering went to Italy for a cruise. Fat Goering also made a special trip to Tripoli Island to visit Italian Air Force Marshal Balbo.</p>
<p>The two air force giants sat together, and they inevitably talked about flying, flying, flying. After Goering blew a ton of German bragging, Balbo was not to be outdone, and talked about the Italian Air Force:</p>
<p>"We have recently invented a light airship that is fast and agile, just like an airplane. General Goering, would you like to try it?"</p>
<p>The opportunity to show off must not be missed. Goering readily agreed to try it, and insisted on driving it himself.</p>
<p>So, the two boarded the ship, Goering drove, and Balbo sat aside. They went into the air.</p>
<p>After flying for a quarter of an hour, everything was fine. The two praised it incessantly. So, they decided to descend, 10,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 3,000 feet, 1,000 feet, 500 feet. Balbo took a look and felt that something was wrong below. It wasn't the sea, it was the airport.</p>
<p>"Old Go, that's not right! This is a ship, it should be on the water..."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Can I still make a mistake about this? I'm just looking around here."</p>
<p>Saying that, Goering raised the airship again and flew to the sea. Balbo was a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>Finally, it stopped on the sea.</p>
<p>Goering had to praise it again:</p>
<p>"This ship is really good, just like an airplane, it's just a pity that it can't land on land."</p>
<p>They pushed it open, stepped out with one foot, and splashed into the water.</p>
<p>"I told you, this is a ship!" Balbo murmured to himself.</p>
<p>"Thank you, General, this way everyone is more comfortable!"</p>

<p>One day, perhaps because his girlfriend turned him down, Mr. Zhang became disheartened and ran to the beach to join the wave god.</p>
<p>"Hey! You can't jump!" A fat police officer just walked by and grabbed him.</p>
<p>"Why can't I jump?" Mr. Zhang unfolded his silver tongue and talked freely about the reasons why he had to jump.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, guess what, the fat police officer went into the sea with Mr. Zhang.</p>

<p>Previous excerpt In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kaiser Wilhelm II" loaded with six million gold bars, went from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the CHUKS Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship for a trip. On the ship they received a message saying war had been declared, and that an English warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship started to run wildly aimlessly. Soon, another message came from the wireless saying that there were icebergs nearby. Fortunately, the icebergs soon slipped past, but soon, another British warship came to intercept and started firing, hitting the stern of the ship, but fortunately, fog descended...</p>
<p>At this time, the ship had sailed into the fog. The cruiser knew that the Kaiser Wilhelm II already had a talisman. The hope of reaching her was already very slim. However, they still worked hard to speed up. The smoke in the chimney kept rising, showing that they still wanted to fight with the "gold transport ship" that was fleeing.</p>
<p>The guns on the cruiser Brock fired again, one shot at the stern of the ship, hitting the ship's name inlaid with gold flowers.</p>
<p>"They want to hit the rudder." Jack said, "This is actually a good way."</p>
<p>"But, if they hit it, it won't be good for us." Nanno smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Two more shots were fired, one from the second cruiser, all hitting nearby. At this time, the fog gradually surrounded the ship, and in just five minutes, it was so thick that you couldn't see your fingers.</p>
<p>So, the blind collision game started again. Captain Locke ordered to open full power... The passengers asked for guarantees and were able to change the method, so that the heat was only within the possible range.</p>
<p>"Under this treatment, Bill cheered up again, hey! Is there anything coming again!"</p>
<p>Outside the fog, it was not known from which direction, a sound could be heard, it seemed like the sound of a heart beating. This was the sound of another ship's engine. What was previously feared was being captured, but now it was feared of collision, because, even in the fog, the captain did not allow the sound of the whistle.</p>
<p>There was simply no way to tell which side it was coming from. It seemed that it could be on either side. Could this be another mail ship, or a warship? This question was a bit troublesome.</p>
<p>In less than a moment, a huge, black ship could be seen vaguely passing by them. In the fog, at a glance, the deck was full of cannons and bullets. It was another British cruiser. Good, just escaped from the tiger's mouth, and sent to the hunter's hand again.</p>
<p>"It's a British warship, it's over!" Bill shouted.</p>
<p>Escaping Death Eight Times</p>
<p>However, the Kaiser Wilhelm II did not just end there. Although, the British on the strange ship, in the midst of the confusion, they did not have time to issue orders, and did not have time to see what was going on. Before they could take a look, they were enveloped in thick fog again.</p>
<p>"My life! If this kind of hardship continues, I really have to go to the mirror to see if my hair has turned white in a hurry." Jack said.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised they didn't take any action." Bill said, "Although, I quite like them not moving."</p>
<p>"They are either too surprised and forgot to fire." Garo said.</p>
<p>"I guess so too." Jack agreed, "No matter why, it's always our lucky star shining."</p>

<h3>The International Exchange Center Remains Unchanged, Shanghai Still Holds the Financial Hub, Industry and Commerce, and Real Estate Are Quite Active, Funds from the Mainland Return to the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Preparation Committee's business report for the Republic of China in 1927, the New Sound News Agency summarized it as follows: This year, the battle line spread, and Shanghai's environment was unprecedentedly difficult. Shanghai, which has always been the financial hub of the country, its position and situation have undergone a change. The reasons why it can still maintain its traditional importance to this day are: First, international exchange is still centered on Shanghai, and transactions are still prosperous; second, the authorities of the two special zones spare no effort to maintain the city's safety and welfare; small industries, commerce and real estate within the boundary are quite active; third, refugees from all over the world come one after another, the population within the boundary increases, and the funds that flowed into the mainland in the previous years are now concentrated in Shanghai again.</p>

<p>The total amount of prepared assets deposited by the banks, according to the year-end settlement this year, is 57,715,043.56 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 1,932,560.16 yuan compared with the end of 1926. The total amount of all prepared assets was 62.01% of the total valuation in the previous settlement, and 62.44% of the total valuation in the next settlement. According to the number of the next settlement, real estate accounts for 86.50% of the total amount, foreign securities account for 6.51%, and domestic public bonds account for 6.99%.</p>
<p>3.  Single-Certificate Discount</p>
<p>According to the year-end settlement, the total amount is 36,014,800 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 464,400 yuan compared with the end of 1926. In the upper settlement this year, the total amount of public certificate discount was 299,708,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 234.6 million yuan compared with the upper settlement in 1926. In the lower settlement, the total amount of public certificate discount was 386,091,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 142.6 million yuan compared with the lower settlement in 1926. The above-mentioned total discount amount is the number of daily statistics. This year, because a small number of colleagues borrowed continuously, the total amount increased greatly compared with last year. The average interest rate of public certificate loans was 30% in national currency and 20% in exchange in the first half of the year, and the average interest rate was 25.8% in national currency and 20% in exchange in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>This year, the total amount of discount on accepted bills of exchange by this association was 9,850,000 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 860,000 yuan compared with 1926. The amount of discounted bills that had not yet expired at the end of the year was 2 million yuan in national currency. The discount rate of accepted bills of exchange by this association is based on the 90-day bill as the standard. The average rate for the whole year was 27.8% in national currency and 20% in exchange.</p>

<h3>Confusion Theory</h3>
<p>— Bian Luo</p>
<p>"Confusion" is generally considered a not very bad shortcoming in modern society, which seems to be better than "doing evil"; for example, if someone says that someone has gambled away all his money, that is a temporary confusion, if he holds a knife to rob money, it is a bit "doing evil", but there are also confusions that are praised, "reading does not seek thorough understanding", "not seeking thorough understanding" is a bit of "confusion", but after Tao Yuanming's leisurely way, it has won everyone's praise. It seems that confusion also has art. Like the so-called alcoholics, most of them are a bit confused and criticized, but Li Taibai is not. Zheng Banqiao said something like "hard to be confused", which can be said to be advocating confusion, and now some people are still pursuing it with relish, which shows that things in the world are originally different in their ingenuity.</p>
<p>Confusion also has true and false distinctions. The confusion of so-called celebrities and hermits is mostly not "true stupidity", but "feigned madness". In addition to drinking, Li Taibai can also hum something like "clouds want clothes and flowers want faces", so even today, liquor stores still want to use "Taibai's legacy" as a slogan, while Liu Adou is a practitioner of "life is happy and must be done". And this same "happy not thinking about Shu" is also his honest words, but he has been laughed and scolded to this day. In fact, no matter whether your confusion is true or false, if you hope to use "purity", "hermitage" or other beautiful names to cover up your confused ease, it will be in vain. Liu Adou is a confused egg that should be laughed and scolded, but in modern times, trying to escape through confusion can only prove one's own decline.</p>
<p>The most in the world are confused eggs who think they are smart. They are not only confused themselves, but also hope that others will be as confused as they are. "Seeking skin from a tiger" should be the ideal fool, but some people kowtow to the tiger for mercy, or send some pork, beef, or their own arms and legs, hoping to give the tiger satisfaction. When they know they have been fooled by the tiger, they should sincerely ask the hunter for help, but they are afraid of killing all the tigers in the world, making the world too peaceful. There are many such confused eggs in the world. As for their own clay feet are already unstable, but they still hope to beat others to kneel down, their courage is commendable, but in reality, it is a confused incompetence.</p>
<p>Also, if you put on a mask of peace, and utter a set of lose-lose nonsense, regardless of the right and wrong, and want to use surrender as a way to survive, these kinds of people still cannot escape their guilt with confusion. There are many precedents in history, but what is the result? It is said "stink for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p>There is such a joke: "A nosy person felt pity for the Qin Hui and Wang Shi statues kneeling in front of the Yue Wang Tomb, and dismantled them and threw them into the river, so as not to be insulted all year round. Who knew that he had a dream that night, dreaming that Qin Hui and Wang Shi came to thank him. When he woke up in the morning, he thought: Qin Hui is so effective, if Yue Wang is effective, what will happen? He hurried to the river to fish them up and repeatedly asked them to kneel there, and no one ever dismantled them again, making them eternally destroyed." The joke is absurd, but the love and hate are very obvious. Qin Jian looks very not smart, and that nosy person is not confused to the end, and finally wakes up and understands the so-called right and wrong of the common people. I hope today's good-hearted people will not be so confused!</p>
<h3>On the Longhai Railway Line (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>——From Shangqiu to Lanfeng——</p>
<p>Four or five carriages were filled with comrades who had been wounded while fighting for justice, enthusiastically discussing their triumphant experiences at the front lines. Some were vigorously waving their injured arms, forgetting the pain in their flesh, and constantly bursting into loud laughter. Although it was midnight, they showed no signs of fatigue.</p>
<p>Not wanting to infringe on their space and to avoid crowding them further, we decided to move our luggage and briefcases onto the roof of the carriage. We then lay down on the arched rooftop.</p>
<p>As the train slowly moved forward in response to the stationmaster's whistle, we passed through gaps between trees, lying flat on the roof, enjoying the silvery sky, the twinkling stars, and the hazy countryside. The fatigue of the past few days was conquered. We thought of taking a ferry to cool off in Shanghai during the summer and resigned ourselves to our current situation. It almost felt like we were on a night ferry again, being tossed about.</p>
<p>In the gentle night breeze, we felt a bit cold and covered our chests with the army blanket beside us. The comrade leaning on the briefcase had already started snoring softly. The train continued straight through the gaps between the trees.</p>
<p>The special "rooftop" train life for several hours passed comfortably. When we woke up from our sleep, the train had stopped at a small station. The sun was rising in the sky, and the sky was filled with colorful clouds. It was morning.</p>
<p>"Crunch... Crunch..." A very slight tremor was heard. The comrades were scattered around the east side of the station, washing their faces. No one paid much attention to the sound.</p>
<p>The tremor became clearer and clearer. Two black dots were spotted in the red glow in the distance. "It's a plane!" someone in the carriage shouted. The station sounded the alarm, and the comrades with minor injuries quickly scattered into the surrounding wheat fields. Only a few seriously wounded comrades stayed in the carriages, feeling secure.</p>
<p>We first brought our briefcases down from the roof, but because they were too heavy, we couldn't run far. We took cover under a large tree about a hundred meters from the station. A lightly wounded comrade nearby was calmly chewing on a large piece of bread.</p>
<p>The plane gradually approached, circled once, and aimed at the station. But the surroundings were empty, with only a few half-empty carriages lying silently. The locomotive had already moved away when the alarm sounded.</p>
<p>It accelerated and flew over the tracks, dropping two silver "iron eggs" from a high altitude. The iron eggs rubbed against the air, creating a sharp whistling sound. We watched it descend until it was almost overhead before closing our eyes tightly.</p>
<p>"Boom!" The sound finally came. In the roar, we only felt many things falling on us, but they didn't weigh much. The air was filled with gunpowder and dust, and our nostrils were about to be blocked. We couldn't open our eyes at all. A few minutes later, the quiet station began to stir again. We opened our eyes and, through the gray mist, saw the comrade chewing on his bread, muttering to himself, blowing away the dirt and ash from his bowl. He seemed to regret that the dirt had ruined his good bowl of noodles.</p>
<p>Less than fifty meters away, a crowd had gathered around the spot where the bomb had landed. No one was killed or injured. Only a small tree was split. The distributors of destruction and chaos gave people not worry, only rage.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the train continued on, but soon stopped again at Minquan Station, supposedly to change the dressings of wounded comrades. It happened once every day. We took this opportunity to go to a nearby small town to replenish our stomachs.</p>
<p>The town was surprisingly lively. The shops seemed to be temporary structures. Many people were selling things on the streets. Although the sounds of cannons and machine guns were getting closer, they said they would rather die than leave their homes. Every family had one or several Mauser rifles. When the opportunity arose, they could rely on them to fight back.</p>
<p>The dressing change for the wounded comrades ended before eleven o'clock, and it was time to leave at noon. We returned to the train and saw that three more "Overseas Chinese Relief Team" cars had been added to the rear. More than a dozen young men and women in their twenties, wearing uniforms and red cross armbands, were sitting and standing by the train. They were led by a foreigner over forty years old and were a very active group.</p>
<p>We immediately wanted to visit them in their car.</p>
<p>After explaining our intentions, the foreigner greeted us warmly. He spoke fluent Mandarin.</p>
<p>He was born in Nanyang. His father was Chinese, and his mother was British. Although he was an older man, his patriotic zeal was no less than that of the young people in the motherland. After the war started, he raised funds in Nanyang and led more than a dozen enthusiastic young people who were studying there back to the embrace of their motherland. The old gentleman introduced us to these young men and women, who were just as young as we were. We shook hands warmly and reported our past experiences to each other in an orderly manner. They all spoke fluent Mandarin. New friends showed the same affection as old friends. We were already on fire with each other.</p>
<p>When it was about to depart, they earnestly asked us to join them in their car. We did not decline and moved our boxes and luggage over. Because the sun was scorching, we went into the ambulance.</p>
<p>"Sitting in a car on a train is also a very rare thing!" Sizheng said in a humorous tone, which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>We talked and sang all the way until the train arrived in Lanfeng at night.</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Readers of the Supplement</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>This is not me being mysterious, nor am I deliberately exaggerating. If it is right to say that the importance of contributors to a supplement is greater than that of the editor, then it is especially right to say that the importance of readers is greater than that of contributors. The reason is very simple: the editor is the distributor, the contributor is the supplier, and the reader is the consumer. According to general principles, demand can determine everything, so readers can also influence editors and contributors. In addition, readers are the absolute majority, readers are the public, and editors and contributors must obey them.</p>
<p>Since readers wield supreme authority over a supplement, I especially want to express my hopes to them.</p>
<p>Many readers, especially young students, think that editors and contributors are always talented people, their articles are always good, and their opinions are always right. Therefore, when they see works that are really inexplicable or contrary to their wishes, they vaguely accept them and dare not ask questions. This is wrong. They should recognize that editors and contributors are by no means perfect geniuses and that they will always have shortcomings. Therefore, I hope that such readers will not be humble.</p>
<p>However, there are many readers, mostly older but also some younger, who are the opposite of the former. They think that editors are always fools and contributors are always mediocre. They don't even bother to look at their supplement. They seem to expect the editor to ask them for advice and other contributors to wait for them to join before they are satisfied. This is also wrong. After all, the establishment of a supplement must have its reasons for existing. You cannot simply dismiss its editors and contributors. Therefore, I hope that such readers will not be arrogant.</p>
<p>Readers who are neither humble nor arrogant are proper readers. I hope that they will express their opinions about a supplement, in other words, about the editors and contributors of the supplement, if they have any. The way to do this is to write a letter to the editor or become a contributor themselves and submit an article. In this way, the editor and other contributors will certainly benefit from your opinions, and all readers, including yourself, will be positively influenced by you.</p>
<p>When you express your opinions in this way, you will naturally know that you should say what you do not agree with and what you hope for. You will naturally also know that you should not be long-winded or overzealous, but speak calmly and frankly. This is the attitude you should take. You know this, so I don't need to say more. But when you use this attitude to express your opinions, especially when writing a letter to the editor, I hope you will have the following two resolutions:</p>
<p>Accept good: If you express your own mistakes, you will be willing to withdraw your opinions and will certainly not argue irrationally or become angry, causing unnecessary and harmful trouble for both parties. Because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will certainly not allow you to indulge in selfishness.</p>
<p>Reject evil: Conversely, if you find that you are not wrong, I hope that you will persevere and repeatedly state your case to achieve your goals, or at least make the supplement you are concerned about revise to a slightly satisfactory point, because the supplement belongs to the public, the public will naturally support your legitimate claims.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that the difficulty is that you do not know whether your own opinions are wrong. Therefore, I hope that you will not express your opinions for the time being until you have a good grasp and fully understand a problem. Wait until you have true knowledge and insight before you put your attitude and resolution into practice.</p>
<p>In short, I hope that every reader of a supplement will regard the supplement you are reading as your own property and imagine that you are the editor and the contributor. You must cherish it: If it is good, you must promote and enhance it; if it is not good, you must correct it and help it. Every proper supplement is always willing to hear the opinions of readers. I hope that you will fulfill your responsibilities as readers and satisfy it.</p>
<p>It is true that supplements can guide readers; however, it is especially true that readers can promote supplements. Supplements must cooperate with readers, that is, cooperate with editors and contributors, so that both supplements and readers can benefit.</p>
<p>Think about it: Which supplement should be promoted and enhanced? Which supplement should be corrected or helped? I hope that you will put it into practice once you have thought about it!</p>
<h3>Expectations for Photojournalists</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiesheng</p>
<p>No one can deny that photography is an important part of propaganda. Since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident opened the prelude to the war, and the August 13th Songhu Battle, comrades engaged in photography have been active in the torrent of the great era, working very hard under the enemy's artillery fire. Both the front and the rear have their footprints, giving us a lot of stimulation, a lot of understanding, and even giving the world a confirmation, exposing the evildoings of the × people. It has played a very important role in propaganda. Don't underestimate these few pieces of glass, they are the demon-revealing mirror of the East Asian fascist bandits.</p>
<p>However, since the Battle of Xuzhou, we have rarely seen the tense work and active posture of photography comrades. For this reason, in the fierce battle of De'an on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway line, the ferocious enemy released poison gas regardless of humanity and international law. We can only see the strange appearance of our loyal soldiers after being poisoned in the text of newspapers, but no photography comrades took pictures of these enemy's criminal evidence to give us a deeper understanding of the rear people and lost good materials for international public relations. In the past, the great victory of De'an on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway line and the defense of Wuhan and other battles, and the recent counter-offensives in various war zones. The activity of the guerrillas, these many real situations of the war of resistance, the commendable and moving feats of the loyal soldiers, are of unknown importance to propaganda. It is very able to inspire everyone's spirit and deepen the people's Liu "the most shifting victory is our confidence", but we rarely see it.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the War of Resistance, no matter what aspect we have accelerated to meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance. Can you abandon the photography comrades who bear a heavy responsibility for propaganda? Can you lag behind? And recently, the government has issued a general order to the commanders of various war zones to provide as much help as possible to reporters and give the greatest convenience in transportation and various aspects. Here, comrades should know how much the government is expecting and encouraging. Comrades, hurry up and work hard, catch up quickly!</p>
<p>Photography comrades, we must have the determination to sacrifice. We are not afraid of hardship and difficulty, go to the front line and the enemy's rear, and even meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance. We must arm the camera!</p>
<h3>Plunged into the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Zhan Yi</p>
<p>——Still a Story of a Girl——</p>
<p>"I said I was a dancer from the metropolis, my name is Lili, I came to Hong Kong to do business, I..."</p>
<p>"Forget it, I don't want to listen anymore, hurry up and change clothes and wash your face."</p>
<p>They stood up in a hurry, one washing her face and the other changing clothes. Soon, they both returned to their original appearance as young female students.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't keep these clothes with us, it will be troublesome when we get there, why not wrap them up and throw them into the sea."</p>
<p>"That's fine, I also want to see what the sea looks like."</p>
<p>They put the clothes they took off in a cloth bag, said they were opening it, and walked towards the deck.</p>
<p>They both felt their footsteps were light, as if they were in a dream. Everything that touched their eyes was so unfamiliar that they had to ask themselves: "Could it be that this is still a dream?"</p>
<p>When they walked to the deck, they suddenly felt that it was not a dream. The winter sea breeze blew sharply through their clothes, making them feel cold and wet. The dampness was the easiest to cause people discomfort; but they felt very refreshed. Except for two or three sailors washing the deck, there was no one else. They arbitrarily sang wordless songs from their hearts, as if all the terror and depression were closed and the song was spat out and dissipated above the vast sea.</p>
<p>Walking closer to the side of the ship, they looked at the sea more carefully. The sea was still calm, but as the ship rushed past, it angrily shouted, rolling with snow-white foam, and roaring unevenly.</p>
<p>They threw the package down, as if the sea had opened its mouth waiting for it, and swallowed it in one bite. Then it turned out again, but it had retreated a little. After sinking again, it was left far away with the foam.</p>

<h3>"July 7th" War of Resistance Commemorative Flowers: Circular to Overseas Chinese Organizations to Start Accepting Orders, Limited to Three Days, Registration Deadline on the 29th; Women's War Relief Association Donates Standard National Flags to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The "July 7th" Vegetarian Flower Sale Campaign launched by the United Federation of Relief for Refugees in South China is intensifying its various tasks. Yesterday, registration for flower collection began at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. In view of the fact that some groups last year actually embezzled the flower money without following the methods of the conference, arbitrarily distributed it, or even concealed it without reporting it, the conference will strictly handle it this year. The circular for flower orders will only be sent to registered overseas Chinese organizations and schools with verifiable addresses. Those who have not registered must provide an official letter from their respective organizations, businesses, or schools to apply, and then the conference will review and approve them to receive the flowers, in order to prevent abuses. The flowers this year are also specially made, using white flowers sprayed with violet, which is not easy for outsiders to imitate. The circulars sent to overseas Chinese organizations totaled 594 letters, which began to be distributed yesterday. All overseas Chinese organizations and schools must first register the number of flowers they wish to order with the office within three days (until the 29th), so that they can be compiled and customized. The estimated number of flowers to be customized is 350,000. The conference also issued an outline of the flower sale campaign, notifying all organizations to comply with it properly.</p>
<p>Outline of the Vegetarian Flower Sale Campaign</p>
<p>(1) Name: "July 7th" Vegetarian and Flower Sale Campaign Conference. (2) Purpose: To commemorate the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots and raise patriotic donations for national salvation. (3) Organization: Jointly responsible and assisted by all Hong Kong overseas Chinese organizations. (4) Responsibilities: (A) Leaders of all overseas Chinese organizations should notify all members of their respective organizations to follow the central government's order to implement vegetarianism. The association will also hold indoor flower sales to raise funds. (B) The savings from the vegetarian meal and the money raised from the flower sales by each overseas Chinese organization may be used for refugee relief or other patriotic donations, but all the funds raised by each association, regardless of the amount, must be handed over to the conference, which will allocate them. (5) Methods: (A) Commemorative flowers will be collected by each overseas Chinese organization from the conference with funds (priced at two yuan and fifty cents per thousand). (B) Each overseas Chinese organization may adapt to its own environment to sell commemorative flowers, seeking to promote convenient and effective methods. (C) Flower sales are limited to indoor sales and should not be hawked outdoors. (D) The commemorative flowers are not priced, and the flower purchasers are free to donate as much as they wish. (E) Each overseas Chinese organization should notify all members of the association to wear flowers on the "July 7th" anniversary to commemorate. (F) Regarding the money from flower sales, each overseas Chinese organization should provide its own storage containers, properly seal them, or use other fraud prevention methods to emphasize the relief funds.</p>
<p>Letter of Notification to All Colleagues from the Organization</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, Since the Lugouqiao Incident, it has been two years now. Our government has designated July 7th as the Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. All Chinese people should have a grand commemoration to mark this day and not forget it. Our association intends to follow the central government's order to observe vegetarianism and hold indoor flower sales on this day to commemorate our loyal soldiers and deceased compatriots, and to awaken the deep awareness of our overseas Chinese. We believe that our colleagues love the country and are never behind others, and they will definitely express sympathy for this initiative. We are writing to ask you to subscribe to commemorative flowers and persuade your colleagues to sell them, and be sure to wear them on the July 7th anniversary to mark this day and not forget it. However, the association urgently needs to know the exact number of subscriptions in advance so that it can collect them from the conference. The subscription notice is enclosed with the letter. Please fill in the quantity of subscriptions as soon as possible and return it to the association for reporting to the conference. Thank you. The gist of the methods is excerpted below: (1) Practice vegetarianism for one day. (2) Hold indoor flower sales and wear them on the July 7th anniversary. (3) All savings from vegetarian meals and flower sales will be handed over to the directly affiliated organizations to be submitted to the conference for distribution. (4) The flowers sold are not priced, and people can donate as much as they wish. Even one cent can buy them. (5) Because the flowers are not easy to manufacture temporarily, all flower recipients must fill out the flower subscription form on the day of receiving the circular and return it to the association.</p>
<p>War Relief Association Donates National Flags to Raise Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Women's War Relief Association, in order to commemorate the second anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance, is taking the opportunity to carry out practical disaster relief work, and has launched a campaign to donate standard national flags to raise funds and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. It has decided to start sending out teams from the 28th of this month, carrying letters to donate national flags to shops and residences in Hong Kong and Kowloon, soliciting relief funds, and hoping that overseas Chinese will actively accept them so that small contributions can add up to a great amount. The statutory standard national flags will be displayed during the "July 7th" anniversary to fully express the patriotic and national preservation enthusiasm in the fluttering flags, and the thousands of refugees will also share the same grace and benevolence.</p>
<h3>Quarantine Between Hong Kong and Macau: Western Doctor's Certificate is Valid, But Must Be Stamped by the Department of Health; Handling Fee of Two Yuan Per Certificate</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of preventing the spread of cholera, the Hong Kong health authorities have cooperated with the Macau authorities to prevent it. All passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Macau must have been vaccinated against cholera within six days to six months prior and have a certificate in order to land. Since the two governments announced this regulation, the general public has flocked to Western doctors licensed by the government to get vaccinated and issued a certificate by the doctor. However, it was later heard that the health authorities announced that this type of certificate that has not been signed by the Hong Kong Port Health Department is invalid, so the Hong Kong Port Health Department has been extremely crowded with people waiting for the certificate to be signed in recent days. However, whether this announcement by the Health Bureau is true or not has not been confirmed. However, the Chinese Medical Association of Hong Kong heard this and was very surprised, because there are no less than one hundred Western doctors in Hong Kong who have government licenses. According to precedents, when the Hong Kong government promulgates new regulations that are related to health issues, it must first notify the Chinese Medical Association to inform all Western doctors. What is the reason why the Health Bureau implemented this regulation without notifying the association in advance? If the truth is to be stated, then all Western doctors in Hong Kong will be greatly affected by this. Therefore, the association specially sent a letter to the health authorities yesterday, raising this issue and requesting an explanation, but as of yesterday, the association had not yet received a reply from the Health Bureau. According to a Western doctor who spoke to the reporter yesterday, there may be some misunderstandings among the public regarding this matter, because anyone who is vaccinated against cholera at a Western doctor's office will be issued a certificate by the doctor, proving that the person has been vaccinated on a certain day. However, the certificate must be submitted to the Hong Kong Port Health Department for a handling fee of two yuan, and the medical officer of the department will stamp and sign it before it can be valid. There is no need for the Hong Kong Port Health Department to administer the cholera vaccine again. With one certificate, you can travel between Hong Kong and Macau within six months without having to obtain another certificate.</p>

<h3>Flashback: The Dispute Over Gas Masks - Henry Keswick &amp; Sons' Appeal Rejected Yesterday, Original Ruling in Favor of the Fourth Route Army Upheld</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the High Court, Justices MacGregor and Trisaw presided over the appeal case concerning the HK$190,000 gas mask dispute. The appellant was Henry Keswick &amp; Sons. Messrs. Deacons retained barristers Sir Athol McGregor and Macnamara to argue the appeal. The respondent, the Fourth Route Army, retained barrister Mr. Woo Siu-how who in turn retained barrister Potter to defend. The details of the hearing are recorded below.</p>
<p>Background to the Dispute</p>
<p>The dispute originated back in 1937 when the representative of the Fourth Route Army stationed in Hong Kong entered into a contract with Henry Keswick &amp; Sons to purchase 100,000 gas masks, valued at HK$190,000, and 8,000 highly explosive bombs, valued at £42,000, equivalent to over HK$670,000. Part of the gas masks arrived in Hong Kong around November 1937. However, the Fourth Route Army found that the masks did not match the samples and sued the company in the District Court, demanding the return of the HK$190,000 already paid. The company refused and counter-sued the Fourth Route Army for the £42,000 owed for the bombs. The District Court ruled that the counter-claim was unfounded and should be withdrawn. The company disagreed and appealed yesterday. This is the origin of the dispute.</p>
<p>Contract Contents</p>
<p>After the court was called to order, barrister Sir Athol McGregor spoke first, detailing the purchase agreement and the primary reasons for the lawsuit, as described above. McGregor added that the District Court's ruling was incorrect and that the £42,000 owed for the bombs should be included in the claim, as the goods became the buyer's responsibility as soon as they left the factory. Barrister Potter, representing the Fourth Route Army, then argued that although the bomb contract stipulated a BAG (Buyer Assumes Guilt) arrangement (meaning the seller is responsible for all costs, insurance, and freight), the goods had not yet been shipped from Europe and the transport documents had not been delivered to the Fourth Route Army. McGregor countered that the company had already allocated the goods for the buyer and intended to ship them, but the buyer refused. Potter responded that while McGregor's argument had some merit, he did not fully understand the true nature of the matter. The nature of C.I.F. (Cost, Insurance, Freight) is not a conclusive contract, meaning simply instructing the manufacturer to allocate the goods to the buyer does not complete the process. Rather, the seller must deliver all shipping documents to the buyer before there is a valid claim to take possession of the goods. Since all documents had not yet been delivered to the buyer, even if the contract included a statement that the factory had delivered the goods, it still could not be used to counter-claim that the Fourth Route Army had breached the contract.</p>
<p>Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>Potter continued, stating that the case was invalid purely because all documents had not been received by the seller, and the Fourth Route Army was therefore justified in refusing payment. He also refuted McGregor's claim that although the appellant did not intentionally demand payment from the Fourth Route Army, appealing on this basis was completely irrelevant. Justice McGregor then spoke, stating that whether the appeal was legitimate or not, it should be concluded promptly and not dragged on. In his opinion, the case required further study. At this point, Justice McGregor ruled to reject the appeal, stating that the case had been vigorously debated and had reached its conclusion. He still considered the District Court's ruling to be appropriate and would release his written judgment in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou Community Relief Association Representative to Meet Xu Shiying Today to Request Funds for Chaozhou and Shantou Refugees; 500 Refugees Concentrated in Jiaoshi in Shantou</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou community in Hong Kong has been extremely busy preparing relief efforts for their homeland. The association had already issued telegrams to government authorities and Chaozhou organizations overseas. Yesterday, association directors Lin Zifeng, Lin Zishi, Ma Zemin, Xu Youmei, Chen Yongzhai, Chen Zizhao, Hong Heyou, and others held a meeting at the Si Wei Company office, deciding to nominate Lin Zifeng to approach Xu Shiying, representative of the Central Relief Committee, to request funds to aid Shantou. Lin is scheduled to meet with Chairman Xu today to discuss the matter. Lin Zishi, responsible for drafting the association's relief plan and outline, has already completed it and will present it for discussion at a meeting tonight at 7:30 PM. The plan's fundraising methods are broadly divided into two points: issuing donation registers to wealthy Chaozhou individuals and launching a "One Dime Campaign" to encourage all Chaozhou people in Hong Kong to contribute. Regarding the refugee situation in the affected areas, current reports indicate that only 500-600 refugees remain in Shantou, concentrated in the Jiaoshi area, urgently in need of assistance. Further information is still awaited.

Attendees included Ye Lanquan (Chairman), Li Jianfeng, Shan Dexin, Lu Guomian, Liu Qingxuan, and others. The meeting resolved to: (1) allocate HK$2,000 to the Foshan Refugee Relief Association; (2) have the Red Cross Society's rescue department take charge of sending an ambulance to Shantou; and (3) for the relief group and auditors to expedite their examination and report on the group's annual accounts.</p>
<h3>× Switches to Piracy Tactics Against Our Fishing Boats, Resulting in HK$60,000 Losses This Month</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in South China, the barbarous acts of × against our fishermen have been commonplace. According to the Fishermen's Progressive Association, losses incurred since last year total over HK$600,000. While the last few months have seen a slight decrease, × has now adopted even more sinister methods than simply looting goods and burning fishing boats. Formerly, burning fishing boats served only to satisfy ×'s 　　　　　 momentary impulse and yielded little profit. Recently, × has shifted to piracy tactics. When looting, × now orders the fishermen to steer the boat to shore, allows them to disembark, and then steals the boat. Twelve such incidents have been reported to the association this month, with losses totaling over HK$60,000.</p>

<h3>False Robbery Report, Fined HK$25</h3>
<p>Ho Yuk-sang, 25, was charged before Magistrate Rice Thomas at the Central Magistracy yesterday morning with making a false robbery report. According to English Detective Constable Cashman, the prosecutor, the defendant reported to the police station on the 22nd of this month that at 6:00 PM that afternoon, he had been robbed at knifepoint in the lane next to 104 Johnston Road, losing HK$14. Chinese Detective Li Jiu-sheng questioned him about the robbery, but the defendant's answers were evasive, and it was eventually discovered that the report was false. He was then detained. After hearing the evidence, the magistrate fined the defendant HK$25 or two months' imprisonment in default.</p>
<h3>New Advertising Technique: Tour Guide Accuses Tourist of Robbery - The Inside Story Revealed, the Goal Was to Get the Story Published in Newspapers, the Drugging and Theft of Rings Were All Fabricated</h3>
<p>Wong Hei, a young man, was accused of stealing two gold rings belonging to Li Qiyun, a female tour guide from Hollywood Tour Guide Service on Bonham Strand East, from the New China Hotel last month, the 24th. This case was further examined yesterday afternoon by Magistrate Edwards at the Central Magistracy. Although the crime was a common theft, the plaintiff stated that after chewing the gum given to her by the defendant, her spirit gradually became disturbed, making the case more complicated. During yesterday's hearing, the government chemist, Mr. Tai Tsang, was called to court to analyze the effects of narcotics on consciousness. He stated that narcotics must be bitter, and it would be difficult to mix them with gum without a special taste. He also stated that a person would become unconscious fifteen minutes after chewing the drugged gum. Afterward, the defendant testified that he was a student at a school in Macau and had known the plaintiff for over a year. When he came to Hong Kong last month, he called the plaintiff to his hotel to talk. He was short on cash and asked her to lend him thirty dollars. The plaintiff replied that she did not have enough money on hand. He then asked her to get the money from her company, but she said she could not. She then suggested that she could give him the rings to pawn. He repeatedly asked her to give him her watch, but she said the watch was very important to her work and she could not part with it. He did not press the matter further. She then said that if her colleagues at the company found out, they would criticize her. She suggested going to the police station to report the theft so that the newspapers would publish the story and make her more famous. The two agreed that he would return the items in a week. On the 20th of this month, he met her near the Datong Restaurant, and she demanded the items back. When he could not produce them, he fled. The magistrate then offered his opinion, stating that according to the hotel manager, the plaintiff did not appear to be in any unusual state, so her testimony was not credible. At the same time, the defendant had fully disclosed the details of the case, but the prosecution had offered a considerable rebuttal. He then judged the defendant innocent, and the defendant was released.</p>

<h3>Chinese Art Troupe to Hold Sixth Performance, Three Consecutive Days Starting on the 28th, Mandarin and Cantonese Groups Performing Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Chinese Art Troupe, led by Ouyang Yuqian, is scheduled to hold its sixth major performance at the Central Theatre in Hong Kong for three consecutive days starting on the 28th. To adapt to the current environment and local needs, the troupe has established a Cantonese group. The actors in the Cantonese group are all well-known movie stars from South China who feel that the current South China film productions are not aligned with the war of resistance and national reconstruction. They have therefore dedicated part or all of their time to the iron theatre movement under Ouyang Yuqian's leadership. In this performance, the Mandarin and Cantonese groups will perform simultaneously. The Mandarin group will perform the matinee. On the 28th, they will perform "The Righteous Song," a national defense drama collectively created by the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Shaanxi. On the 29th, they will perform "A Moment of Pride," a three-act satirical play written by Chen Baichen. On the 30th, they will perform Ouyang Yuqian's "In the Green Gauze Tent" and the one-act play "Dawn." The troupe has performed these three national defense dramas before with great success. This revival aims to achieve widespread publicity. Ticket prices are only one, two, three, and four dimes. The Cantonese group will perform "Flowers Splashed with Tears" for three consecutive nights starting on the evening of the 28th. The play has been performed several times in Shanghai, drawing huge crowds. The play depicts the various forms of oppression faced by women, and the plot is very moving. The Cantonese group performance will feature talent such as Zhu Jianqin, Li Danlu, Li Youci, Yu Liang, Hu Meilun, Hu Dieli, Zhang Chong, Chen Tianzong, Zhang Jingyuan, and Feng Feng.</p>

<h3>Island Scenery! "Mahjong" "Teen Gow"</h3>
<p>By: Yu Man</p>
<p>Special Feature in This Newspaper</p>
<p>The setting sun kisses the western mountains. Scale-like flowing clouds, clusters of red, clusters of yellow, purple and blue, are colored especially movingly. The sea breeze blows in the evening, ruffling the thin silk garments of the rich.</p>
<p>--At this time, the bustling city seems to whisper to people in private: This wonderful time is not right without "Mahjong"... Women and children, if you are not proficient, you always have the familiar "Teen Gow" [a Chinese domino game]!</p>
<p>Mahjong and Teen Gow are our national essence, we have this charming national essence! Walk on the long street, walk in the alley, whether it is the villa of the rich or the home of the poor. Simply, there is not a place that is not a crazy clamor of clattering and banging!</p>
<p>It is a villa: On the streamlined copper railing, brightly reflects a three-headed electric lamp, the fan is waving on the top, the crimson silk lampshade, unusually magnificent, expensive furniture, the yellow orange shines brightly on the women sitting on the sofa dressed in red and green. Fan-tailed palms sway elegantly in the wind, the ladies’ “cloud whiskers” are also full of smiles in the wind! Rustling, clattering—their “gambling life” starts like this. It is the home of the poor, beside the stone mercy, hung tattered clothes, a dirty and broken awning made of burlap, drooping down--is the corner of the arcade, rustling, clattering, they are the beginning of gambling.</p>
<p>Hotels, restaurants, the authority of the night dominates the souls of the metropolis! Elevators, hauling up batches of pleasure seekers, listening rooms, seats, are full of an atmosphere of drunken life and dreaming death! Second floor, third floor, up to the top floor. There are no seats, ah, rustling...clatter! “Red Middle” “White Board” “Get Rich” mixed with arguments and debates, debts and clear wins, the atmosphere has a deep smell of cigarettes, as well as the fragrance of tea, coffee, especially the fragrance of rouge!</p>
<p>Clubs, are also dissolving pleasantly, here, there are no ball games, no ping-pong games, and no music or books. Most of the clubs in your country are happy to "gamble"! Gambling, and everyone is happy, as the name implies, this is the "club." Because participants in entertainment often have disputes, almost all club walls conspicuously hang "Mahjong Rules"—"…nine cards on the ground…play again… to cover…sea bottom fishing, limited to夭筒, the rest is counted as three fan…”. Such complexity is unbelievable, losing money, rules, regulations, damn it! Are you still afraid of the limitations of regulations when you lose money?</p>
<p>People, people who are addicted in the circle. In short, in every space, even if it is so crowded that water cannot leak through the two-story building, they have to "fight spleen"! On the bed, in the corner, even, next to the threshold of the kitchen, they also sat or stood five or six friends of Mahjong or Teen Gow. In terms of time, regardless of day and night, almost the painting is their time. All-night, people with illnesses must also sacrifice for gambling! Cerebral hemorrhage is the cause of their death, but, one after another, they seem to be striving for the final victory with an "immortal" determination?</p>
<p>As for Mahjong and Teen Gow “yes,” their gambling spirit is really astounding! A shop with no windows, has more than ten square tables horizontally and vertically. People sweating, almost more than fifty people gathered, suffocating air filled the entire shop, however, they also forget to eat and sleep, and fight each other to go to "war," for the body? Or for the soul" This, I do not know.</p>
<p>Statistics, this is a shocking statistic: How many "Mahjong Teen Gow lending agencies" are there in Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula? One thousand, good! At a minimum, on average, each has at least five sets of Mahjong and ten sets of Teen Gow. Fifty percent are rented out every day! The total number of Mahjong is two thousand and five, and the total number of Teen Gow is five thousand; side generals, at least four people, Teen Gow, may well discuss with four people, multiplied by four, there are 10,000 people playing Mahjong, and 20,000 people playing Teen Gow. (—Mahjong halls are not yet included.) And the "time" that these 30,000 people spend in "gambling" is only left to smart readers to accurately calculate.</p>
<p>The motherland is in the smoke of war everywhere, the soldiers in the front are bleeding and breaking their heads, today, when 450 million people are suffering a great disaster together, people of all Chinese children have a position to save the country. If there are these 30,000 people in Hong Kong every day, what would the situation of the motherland be like if they spent the time in "four circles" "eight circles" "twelve circles" ... to rescue the motherland? When Schlander was quiet, under the pen of this astonishing statistics, we had such an estimation!</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate Secretary Violates Order, Takes Photos in Military Zone, Detained at Police Station for Questioning Before Release, Truth Likely to Emerge from Film Processing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's military areas prohibit photography by outsiders. During this emergency period, the ban is enforced even more strictly. On the afternoon of the 25th, two Japanese nationals, a man and a woman, defied the order and took photographs in the restricted area near Davis Battery on Pok Fu Lam Road. While they were taking the photographs, they were discovered by reconnaissance officers, who intervened and sent the two Japanese nationals to the police station for questioning. The Japanese man identified himself as Matsumoto, a long-serving employee of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong. The woman with him was his sister. After a brief interrogation, the police released both of them without bail. At the same time, they declined to comment on the matter. The Japanese national was using a small camera with a 2.8 lens, which could capture everything clearly regardless of weather conditions. The police authorities have confiscated the camera and are processing the film to determine the area that was photographed. The future disposition of the matter is still unknown. The reporter from the Hong Kong Telegraph later visited Matsumoto to inquire about what happened. He said that he was the secretary of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong and the woman was his sister. At the time, they were taking photos of each other on the Peak. Later, the police intervened and sent them to the police station for questioning. All that can be said is that, in addition to taking personal photos, they did not photograph any other houses or buildings. The film is currently being processed by the police station, and the truth will emerge soon.</p>

(3) In the 1,000-yuan national currency donation movement, Japanese × traitors have been using their tricks to obtain our legal currency. Recently, due to our army's retreat to Shantou, the traitors have been even more active. "In order to show their support for the leader, the organization presented the National Government and the Military Commission with 1,000 yuan in national currency, to express the overseas Chinese's never forgotten homeland.</p>

<h3>Victoria Swimming Club vs. Intercity Swimming Competition - Discussing Going to Shanghai to Participate - Intending to Use Proceeds from Water Skills Association to Allocate Travel Expenses - Army Representative Greatly Interested in Intercity Competition</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:45, the Victoria Swimming Club, in order to discuss the matter of participating in this year's Intercity Swimming Competition to be held in Shanghai, specially convened the entire swimming community to hold a meeting at the club. The attendees only included Jie Choushi of the Victoria Club, Robes, Shili, Balidu, Gao Luwen of the YMCA, Colonel Wen of the Army Club, and Huang Shaoxiong of the Chinese YMCA. Chairman Jie Tian Shi first read the letter from Shanghai inviting the Hong Kong team to go to Shanghai in early September, saying that according to precedent, this Intercity Swimming Competition should be held in Shanghai. If we do not go this time, the Intercity Competition between the two places in the future will be interrupted. Therefore, after receiving the letter, the club had no choice but to temporarily accept Shanghai's proposal. In previous years, Victoria Club members who were selected to participate in the competition received travel subsidies from their parent club, but this method cannot be generalized. Therefore, the club proposes that in the future, the surplus from the Intercity Competition should be allocated to a reserve fund as travel expenses for athletes between the two places. This time, the expenses for going to Shanghai are planned to be raised by the Water Skills Association.</p>
<p>Robes said that the travel expenses to Shanghai are about 150 to 160 yuan per athlete, which is a considerable expense.</p>
<p>Army Representative Wen said that we military personnel are very interested in participating in the Intercity Competition and will definitely work hard to make it happen in the future.</p>
<p>Jie Tianshi finally said that in previous years, the Hong Kong Open Swimming Competition hosted by Victoria was mostly held in late autumn. If this Intercity Competition can be held in Shanghai in early September, the Hong Kong Open Championship will be held in August, and the team can be selected from this. Currently, only one person from the Chinese Association is participating in this meeting, making it impossible to have in-depth discussions. A second meeting will be convened in two or three weeks.</p>
<p>The items for the Intercity Competition are as follows: 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 220-yard freestyle, 440-yard freestyle, 880-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, 100-yard breaststroke, 180-yard three-person three-style swimming, 240-yard four-person relay swimming, fancy diving, water polo competition.</p>

<h3>Public Water Polo Competition - Zong Sheng Actually Overwhelms South China - Chinese A Also Wins West YMCA Three to Zero</h3>
<p>The first evening of the Hong Kong Public Water Polo Competition, held at 8:30 last night, was held at the Chinese Association and South China Association venues respectively. The match at the Chinese venue was between Chinese A and the Western Youth YMCA. Chinese A is the best of the Hong Kong water polo teams, with strong strength and overlooking everything. However, the opponent is not weak, but compared with Chinese A, in terms of technology, it is slightly inferior. As a result, the Western Youth YMCA succumbed and was miserably defeated by Chinese A by a score of three to zero. As for the Zhong Sheng team versus South China team match held at the same time, it was held at the South China venue. The South China team has strong strength and won the water polo championship last year, dominating North Point. Last night, the entire team went into battle, but the Zhong Sheng team was tenacious, not long in strength, and worked hard to fight, striving to frustrate its vigor. As a result, the ambition was achieved and they won with a score of two to zero.</p>
<h3>Important Local News in Southern China - The Guangdong Industrial Management Office Actively Plans - To Develop Provincial Industries - Convening Factory Directors to Shaoguan to Discuss Implementation</h3>
<p>[Qujiang Airmail] After Li Han-hun took over the provincial government, he devoted himself to planning the development of rear area production and construction, and paid special attention to the organization of wartime industries. The Industry Office was specially restored. From then on, the development of wartime industries. The office has moved to northern Guangdong for many days. On the 18th, the reporter visited Deputy Director Zhang Zhongxin to inquire about various matters. According to the conversation, the following is the case.</p>
<p>Past Situation of Provincial Industries</p>
<p>After the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, the aggressors continuously tried to sabotage the Guangdong provincial industries. In order to support the long-term resistance war and maintain the original industries, we actively maintained them in a difficult environment. And last October, the aggressors launched the South China War. After Guangzhou was trampled on by the aggressors, the provincial factories were forced to completely shut down. The Industry Office also moved to Xijiangnan Road after the fall of Guangzhou, and was in the process of winding down. Chairman Li returned to govern Guangdong, believing that industry is of utmost importance to wartime production, and that it is necessary to adjust and restore it in time. He specially ordered the office to move from Xijiang to northern Guangdong, and to actively develop our wartime industries in accordance with the construction department of the wartime administration program.</p>
<p>The Entire Development Plan Has Been Set</p>
<p>After the office moved to northern Guangdong, in addition to implementing the construction part of the recently approved wartime administration program of the provincial government, it will also implement the support of local private industries, welcome overseas Chinese to return to invest, and move coastal private factories to the interior according to the results of Director Zhu Xiaori's inspection tour. Currently, we are starting to convene the former factory directors and managers of provincial factories to Shaoguan to make a general settlement of the past factory operations and matters to be organized. Reviewing the past and encouraging the future is currently a period of reorganization.</p>
<p>Both Human and Material Resources are Valued</p>
<p>The five issues that should be paid attention to in the future are financial resources, human resources, raw materials, transportation, and management. Since the provincial industries were destroyed by the aggressors, production has been suspended, funds are not available, and there are many debts. First of all, in terms of finance, we rely on overseas Chinese investment and the support of all parties. Second, in terms of human resources, such as technical professionals and workers, we must also find ways to recruit them. Third, in terms of raw materials, because the coast has been blockaded by the aggressors, the source of raw materials is often interrupted or unsustainable. Therefore, inland industries must find places to produce raw materials themselves in order to achieve self-sufficiency. The fourth and fifth transportation and management items should not be ignored. Because inconvenient transportation will make it impossible to sell the products, and poor management will also hinder the entire plan. The office is currently planning in detail to solve the above major problems.</p>
<h3>East River Floods - Agricultural Harvests Have Been Hopeless</h3>
<p>(East River Express) In recent days, there has been continuous heavy rain in Longchuan, Laolong, Heyuan and other places in the upper reaches of the East River. The river water has risen again, and all low-lying villages along the river have been submerged again. All agricultural products and fruits and vegetables have been flooded three times, and the harvest is hopeless. The general farmers have suffered three floods in a row, and they are all complaining. It is found that in Huizhou, the village roads attached to the city are all submerged, and the transportation is all by boat. It is now the evacuation period, and the general old, weak, women and children go out in the morning and return in the evening. Because of the water, the general boatmen are raising prices three times as much during this period. It is found that since the 23rd, the weather in the upper reaches has cleared up, and the East River water has slowed down and gradually receded by more than a foot. It should be able to completely recede within one or two days. Fortunately, this time the East River flooded again, but it did not cause a disaster for long, but the losses should also be significant.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Armed Fighting in Boluo - Still Not Ceased - Both Sides Are Going to Extremes - It Will Inevitably Be a Lose-Lose Situation</h3>
<p>[East River Express] Dozens of villages in Su Village, Boluo County, including Pushang and Puxin, have recently experienced an unprecedented large-scale armed fighting, with deaths and injuries everywhere. The authorities of Huizhou and Boluo counties sent teams to suppress the fighting, but it has not yet ceased. It is found that on the 19th, Huang Zhongyu, the county magistrate of Boluo County, led a team to mediate separately. When they arrived at Dingling, the red flag boundary of the Red Flag Township, the red flag villagers mistakenly thought it was a white flag squad and opened fire with machine guns at the Huang County magistrate's troops. Later, the shooting stopped after County Magistrate Huang blew his whistle to signal. County Magistrate Huang is now trying to suppress the fighting. If the two sides still do not stop, they will only ask their superiors to implement a military solution. It is found that the grievances between the Red and White flags are getting deeper and deeper. Now, the teams are in place to suppress the fighting. On the surface, it is still relaxed, but in fact, both sides are secretly planting their own forces and recruiting villagers from several counties to enlist in the army. The movement is frequent. If villagers nearby are willing to join the armed fighting, each person will be given 50 yuan of national currency. Judging from this point, it is enough to prove that the two sides are preparing for a decisive battle, and there is a trend that they will not stop until both sides are scattered and injured.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Rages Anew</h3>
<p>Our Army Attacks Wen Ge</p>
<p>[North River News] The Guangdong-North Conghua-South Shengang Datong aggressor army has been busy mobilizing within the week, and has joined the aggressors in Zengcong to attack the Republic-sent Tan and other places. According to reports, our Peng Division attacked the aggressors in Wen Ge on the morning of the 21st. There were about a thousand aggressors there, stubbornly resisting by relying on fortifications. After confronting each other for several hours, we rushed into the aggressor position, killed dozens of people, and withdrew to the original position. By noon on the 22nd, our army again launched a surprise attack on the aggressors. The aggressors, relying on their powerful artillery fire, indiscriminately fired at our positions. Our army is still firmly grasping favorable terrain and calmly advancing. The aggressors, having suffered heavy losses, transferred more than 300 people from the 22nd to Taipingchang for replacement.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting at the Edge of Xin Jietang</p>
<p>Also, the aggressors in Xin Jie, on the morning of the 22nd, sent more than 100 infantry artillery soldiers to the Tangbian Zhucun area west of Xin Jie, and encountered our Zhao Division's assault team, and then launched a fierce battle. The position was repeatedly retreated and advanced. Our fresh troops were continuously reinforced from the Maxi area, and a unit was sent from the Bicun area to attack the aggressors in Xin Jie. The aggressors were contained and retreated from the original road, abandoning a lot of ordnance. Our army took advantage of the momentum to advance, fighting fiercely for three or four hours, annihilating many aggressors. The remaining aggressors in Xin Jie can be wiped out with one drumbeat.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers in Guizhou Request - To Return to the Battlefield - Commendable Loyalty and Patriotism</h3>
<p>[Guilin Airmail] Deng Lin, Xie Mingshan, Yang Qingfeng, Wu Yinting, Tang Bofan, Liao Shibaobao, Tao Yucheng and 29 other wounded soldiers of the Eighth Army Hospital in Guizhou Province, recently, with the aggressors increasingly eager to invade us, in order to fulfill their military duty and defend the country and nation, either their injuries have just healed, or they have not yet recovered, have all voluntarily requested to be reorganized into a team to go to the front line to kill the aggressors. Their loyalty, courage and patriotic enthusiasm are commendable.</p>
<h3>The aggressors attempt to confuse the audience, impersonating our logo, and the war zone issues a strict order to prevent it</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express] The Fourth War Zone Command yesterday ordered the various army groups, guerrillas in various districts, and administrative commissioners of various districts, saying that according to reports, the southward invading aggressor army has failed miserably, and has exhausted all kinds of conspiracies, not only has it made no progress, but it has been checked by us everywhere, and the date of its collapse is becoming increasingly obvious. Recently, they have even impersonated our army flags and logos in an attempt to disturb the audience, confuse our people's hearts, and there are a total of three types, one is the Chinese Revolutionary Army, one is the Guangdong Revolutionary Army, and one is the National Revolutionary Army. It should immediately order its subordinate units and people to strictly prevent and avoid falling into the aggressor's poisonous scheme.</p>
<h3>Preventing Aggressors from Releasing Poison, Gu Dinghua Issues a General Order to Various Counties</h3>
<p>[Changsha Express] The Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of the First District yesterday telegraphed the various county magistrates, saying that it has now been forwarded to Bai Zhuren Dian Kai, according to which, the aggressors are using the early summer climate to send traitors disguised as refugees, carrying thermos bottles containing infectious disease bacteria such as cholera, plague, diphtheria, dysentery, and typhoid fever, and sneaking into Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan and other places, designing to distribute them in our military positions and water quality, and also investigating our army and air force reserve conditions. Those sent to Chongqing, Xi'an, Guilin, Jinhua, Shaoguan and other places have already departed from Nandao, Xiamen, Shantou, Langzhou, Hankou and other places on April 16. The second batch is now practicing in the Immigration Hospital and will soon be sent from Nantong to Jiangbei, etc. Due to this, it is necessary to be strictly vigilant, Commissioner Gu (14th) bowed.</p>
<h3>Various Places in the East River - Tragically Bombed - The aggressor aircraft rampages for days</h3>
<p>[Boluo Express] For days, the aggressor aircraft have continuously bombarded Huiyang, Boluo, Haifeng, and Zijin counties, paying special attention to the waters off Jiumenma of Haifeng. Zijin and other county towns were bombed on the 21st. The aggressor aircraft dropped a total of sixteen bombs, killing more than thirty men and women, and the disaster situation was quite serious. At 7:30 on the morning of the 23rd, an aggressor aircraft flew from Zengcheng towards Boluo, Huiyang, Pingshan (affiliated to Huizhou), and Haifeng, distributing leaflets, which were nothing more than words urging our soldiers and civilians. At noon on the same day, 27 aggressor aircraft, in three batches, spied on Heyuan, Zijin, Haifeng, Lufeng, Huiyang, and Boluo counties, dropping more than ten bombs over Haifeng, destroying dozens of civilian houses and causing many casualties. Detailed disaster information is under investigation.</p>
<h3>The Department of Education Sends Personnel - To Supervise the Graduation Exams of Hong Kong and Macau Secondary Schools - And Sends Inspectors to Various Counties to Supervise the Exams</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express] The Department of Education has decided to stop holding the graduation examinations for secondary school students in the province this year, and has decided to send inspectors to various schools to supervise the exams in order to eliminate abuses. According to sources, Minister Xu believes that since the retreat from Guangzhou, many secondary schools have moved to Hong Kong and Macau to hold classes. The graduation exams of the students this year should be strict so that the graduation results of the students can meet the original standards. Yesterday, he specially ordered Zhang Zimo, the inspector stationed in Hong Kong by the department, to strictly supervise the graduation examinations of the schools in Hong Kong and Macau, to strictly review the exam questions for each subject, and to order the schools to hold them on schedule. Also, in order to strictly carry out the graduation examinations of secondary schools in various counties, the Department of Education, in addition to deciding to send inspectors to supervise the exams in various counties at the time, also ordered the educational institutions of various counties yesterday to send inspectors to supervise the exams together at the time.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Hainan Island - Implements a Blockade of the Occupied Areas - Those Who Transport Enemy Goods Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>[South Road Express] It is found that using war to support war is the aggressor army's means of economic aggression. The aggressor army invading Hainan, because military progress is impossible, has recently transported a large number of inferior goods to Hainan for dumping. At the same time, they also instigated traitors and ignorant people to go to our rear areas to buy large quantities of grain, minerals, and various agricultural products to supply their lack of resources. The plan is extremely poisonous. Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, and Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, reported that in order to smash this conspiracy of the aggressor army, they specially ordered the blockade of Chengmai, Qiongshan, Lingao, Wenchang, Anding, Yaji and other nine counties and cities yesterday. All items that can support the aggressors are prohibited from being transported into the counties. Those who transport and sell aggressor goods will be punished for undermining the War of Resistance. We must completely smash the aggressor army's conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Tennis Charity Match - Will Soon Become a Reality - Xiao Linzhen and Wang Wenzheng Collaborate in Doubles</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western North-South Tennis Charity Match being organized by the South China Association has moved from the brewing stage to the solidification stage. Yesterday, Huang Zhibin, the director of the tennis department of the association, told reporters that the original order was for a total of three matches, (1) Wang Wenzheng vs. Xu Weipei, (2) Diao Zuqian vs. Luo Wenhui, (3) Wang Wenzheng Defu vs. Xu Brothers, but now Luo Wenhui is too busy with official duties to participate. Therefore, the association decided to urge Ling Daoyang or Ao Linzhen to make a cameo appearance. Defu, the former Shanghai champion, has the same difficulty as Luo, and cannot help. Fortunately, Xiao Linzhen took the initiative and decided to collaborate with Wang Wenzheng in doubles. In the Kimura tennis world, Xiao Linzhen's technique is second only to Xu Weipei, and he and his brother have won the Hong Kong Doubles Championship for eleven consecutive years. Past achievements can be said to be unprecedented. This time, although the collaboration with Wang Wenzheng is the first time, it can be determined that there will be a solid and wonderful performance. A few days ago, the original suggestion for the competition venue was the club's tennis court in Kowloon Royal Park, but the transportation there is inconvenient, which has a great impact on the income from the charity. Therefore, it was decided to change the venue to the Chinese Recreation Club. The time is still July 1st (Sunday) at 3:00 PM. Tickets are divided into two yuan, one yuan and five cents. Then Huang said to the reporter that Wang Wenzheng's name may seem very unfamiliar to people in Hong Kong, but four years ago, Wang defeated the famous Carson in Shanghai and won the Shanghai Hard Court Championship. Three years ago, he defeated Gavia in Manila, and cooperated with Qiu Feihai in doubles, defeating Sanmona and Aragon, sweeping the Philippines. Over the years, he has gone deep into Chongqing and has no opportunity to practice, but his "cowhide essence" technique still has great power.</p>
<h3>Jianquan Cup Table Tennis Charity Match - Women's Group Finals Tonight</h3>
<p>The Jianquan Cup Men's and Women's Team Table Tennis Tournament sponsored by the Jianquan Tai Chi Quan Association, the men's championship, has been won by the Confucius Society. The women's championship will be held tonight at the Confucius Society's gymnasium, at 8:00, South China Athletic Association Women's A vs. Xinxiu. Both sides are the top players of the moment. South Women's A has even strength. Since its debut, it has never lost. The team has warriors Yang Weibin, Shi Baolian, Su Yanxiang, Mo Huanqiong, which are especially called the top choice. Xinxiu team has seemed unfamiliar in recent days because of the examination. The main players are the Chen sisters, Lu Zhaoyi, Wen Peizhen, and Zhu Jiaoxin. The technology is relatively pertinent. It is expected that Nan Women's A can win. According to the previous Nan A victory over Xinxiu, the score is one point higher, but if they take advantage of the victory tonight and defeat the opponent again, the championship throne will not be shaken. Otherwise, the two teams will have a final. The list of players for the two teams is listed below</p>

<h3>Discussing the Ancient Greeks and All Aspects of the Olympic Games—A Precious History of Education—</h3>
<p>— Ding Lao</p>
<p>When the conference in January 1894 had not yet opened and was in the preparatory stages, Dr. Albestsbow and Professor Williams Miliicans Oane, in their writings, generally said that the revival of modern life and the Olympic Games was a very interesting event. However, at that time, the attitudes of various countries were quite pessimistic. The German sports league did not pay attention to this matter. The French sports organizations did not approve of this kind of organization. The British were also very indifferent. The Belgians simply expressed their opposition clearly. The general public believed that gymnastics and athletics were mutually exclusive events, and most were unwilling to see the success of the meeting. Only Italy, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland sent formal representatives to participate. The assembly was full of solemn celebratory spirit, the attitude was also amiable, and the atmosphere was very serious. Couberrin's intense opening speech, O Sicard's pastoral poetry, and the hymn to Pallo recently discovered in Delphi, as well as the closing banquet, were all unforgettable. Therefore, in just one week, the result of the discussion was the unanimous passage of the revival of the Olympic Games, deemed necessary for the revival of the body in the 20th century.</p>
<p>When the Greeks first heard about the opening of the games, they were very opposed. Fortunately, the Crown Prince was an enthusiastic advocate for the revival of the games. The general royal family also supported the meeting and declared that this undertaking would be supported in terms of both material and spiritual resources. In 1895, funds were raised for the games. Within two months, over 130,000 Brochmae were donated. According to M. Biblas' opinion, Greece should send a committee member who is a person of high moral character and renowned for their literary achievements, to sincerely welcome the President of the International Committee. G, a merchant from Alexandria, Avesaff, donated one million Drachmae silver coins to revive the ancient stadium. The entire building was made of marble with seating for 80,000 people. Furthermore, for the purpose of promoting physical education, the Zappas brothers donated a vast legacy. M. Artonopaule and Alcxandec Mescatil also did their best to help with Greek policy. At that time, it was rumored that many American expeditions would attend, so the magnificent and beautiful original arena in Athens was built, and the entrance tickets were sold very cheaply. However, the overall construction aimed for the original flavor and did not consider convenience for practice, focusing on ancient models. Therefore, although a lot of money was spent on the stadium in Athens, there were many unsatisfactory points. However, in the competition, even the ancient and little-known Marathon race was included as a type of competition. Originally, Marathon was the ancient battlefield of the war between Greece and Persia in 490 BC. During the fierce war, when the Greek citizens were preparing for the departure of the second batch of soldiers, a man named Phldippides ran from the battlefield, over 216 miles and 385 yards, from the fields of Marathon to the capital to announce the victory to the surrounding citizens. He shouted, "We have won!" Due to exhaustion, he died. The result of opening the first Olympic Games caused the Greeks to become very excited and they wanted to hold the meeting in Athens again. Later, they learned that each country would take turns being the host nation. In 1896, Athens, Greece; in 1900, Paris, France; in 1904, St. Louis, USA; in 1908, London, England; in 1912, Stockholm, Sweden; in 1916, originally scheduled for Berlin, Germany, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of war; in 1920, Antwerp, Belgium; in 1924, Paris, France again; in 1928, Amsterdam, Holland; the tenth time, in 1932, is scheduled for the United States. Of the above nine Olympic Games, the second in Paris was overshadowed by the World's Fair, and the seventh in Belgium was solely for doing business, neither of which was the international Olympic Games in our ideal. But the spirit initially hoped for in the international Olympic Games was originally the All Sports For All of all mankind. Therefore, the committee members from both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres organized the games from a moral standpoint. It is not only an individual competition but also a national competition, allowing both men and women to display courageous behavior and a gentle attitude before humanity. Observing from the current situation, the International Olympic Games will probably gradually be approved of!</p>
