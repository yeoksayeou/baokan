<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>論蘇聯的外交政策</h3>
<p>— 沈志遠</p>
<p>『蘇聯底外交政策』，這個問題、我想分為三，夾霜：</p>
<p>一，蘇聯外交政築底客觀基礎。</p>
<p>二，近年來蘇聯和平外交底收獲及其意義。</p>
<p>三，中蘇外交底過去及其展望。</p>
<p>一，蘇聯外交政策底客觀基礎</p>
<p>（一）從社會經濟制度上觀察蘇聯對外侵略的不需要。</p>
<p>一，蘇聯的生產不是為私人的利潤，蘇聯是社會主義的國家，和資本主義的國家不同。社會主義生產所追求的，不是少數人的利益，而是大衆的福利。資本主義的國家，適得其反，唯一的目標：是追求資本家的利潤。基於這一個異點，兩者在對外政策上，就背道而馳了。資本主義的國家，為了追求利潤，不得不爭取國外的市場，來推銷他們的商品；不得不强佔別國的資源，來供給他們的原料；不得不發展國外的投資，來利用他們的資本，實行對落後民族大衆的直接　削。簡言之，他們為了利潤，在他們不斷榨取之下，國內市場一天天縮小，就不得不向外擴張勢力。甲國向外擴張，乙國也向外擴張；甲國排斥乙國，乙國也排斥甲國；最後勢必斥之武力，引起戰爭！請看今日國際上這樣緊張的局面，為的是什麼？為的是資本家爭奪更大利潤底泉源！蘇聯生產不是為着私人的利潤；蘇聯財當生產底發展，同時隨着全體人民福利底提高，大衆購實力底不斷增長所以沒有必要去對外侵略，它與別方的國家間的關係，沒有像帝國主義各國間的那種爭奪殖民地市　的矛盾。所以它不需要用戰爭的手段對付別國，它只要用和平親善的方式與別國維持平等的經濟關係。這是從社會經濟制度上分析蘇聯不需要對外侵略的一個理論根據。</p>
<p>二，蘇聯沒有生產與消費的矛盾。蘇聯生產的目的，是提高大衆的享受，增加物質的建設社會上每個人都亭受同樣的保護。資本主義的國家，適得具反，他們為了少數人的利潤，犧牲了多數人的幸福，他們的國富一天一天的增加，他們的煤油大王，汽車大王什麽什麼大王的荷包一天一天的充實，可是他們的民衆，印一天一天的貧苦。這就是說，一方面是少數人富，另一方面是多數人窮；一方面是機器工廠的增加，另一方面是失業破產的普遍。結果是生產品激增，而購實力銳減。這一個矛盾的現象使資本主義的國家，不得不向外侵略。蘇聯完全不同，他們的國富增加，他們的社會福利也隨着增加。這次報　上所記戰的第三次五年計劃，已經吿訴我們，蘇聯人民的生活水準，隨着他們的生產力，作累進的提高。工資率的激增，大學校的添設，保育院，公共醫院，產婦調養所的普遍，這一切都可以證明人民生活的日益優裕，和生產力的猛烈發展，已取得平衡的速度，這不能不關功於他們的計劃經濟。我們看一九二九到一九三三年的世界經濟恐慌，帝國主義的國家，生產過剩，失業激增，商店破產，人民購買力一落千丈；然而蘇聯，在一九三二年以前，早沒有失業的現象，世界經濟恐慌中，他不但沒有受到絲毫的打擊。並且更是繼續的繁榮。第一次五年計劃期內，商品感覺缺乏，固然是由于　工業不能有充分地發展，而人民購買力的加增，也是主要的因棄。總而言之，蘇聯沒有生產和消費的矛盾現象，有時還求過於供，所以他沒有侵略的必要。蘇聯，上自最高領袖，下至最　層的老百姓，都是勞動者，雖然現在還有勞心和勞力的區別存在，但將全國文化水準提高，一定可以打破勞心和勞力的鴻溝，一定可以做到每個人都是工程師，都是科學家；到那時，他們的工作時間減少，研究娛樂的時間加多，換言之，一般人民的消費逐漸加增。消費隨着生產的增加而增加，生產與消費矛盾的現象根本不會發生，因而對外的侵略亦不需要。這是從蘇聯的社會經濟制度上分柝蘇聯不需要對外侵略的另一個理論根據。</p>
<p>（二）無產階級專政也是蘇聯不需要對外侵略的一個客觀基礎。社會主義的經濟制度，和勞動階級專政是分不開的，如果蘇聯的資本家依然存在，依然把握着政權，那麽，蘇聯的社會主義輕濟制度，是行不通的。蘇聯因為是勞動階級執政所以能保護現在的社會經濟制度，而社會主義勞工政權和社會主義的經濟制度，是根本上跟侵略不兩立的。</p>
<p>（三）從客觀基礎上觀察蘇聯對外侵略的不可能：一，蘇聯的和平外交政策，已經為全國八民所擁戴因為它是適合全國人民底利益的。假如蘇聯有一個瘋子，要侵略中國，我想蘇聯全國人民一定要檢斃他。人民的意見是如此，蘇維埃政府是由人民選出的，當然不能違反民意，這是第一個不可能。二，蘇聯的和平外交政策，己經為國際間所同情，因為它是適合全世界正義人類之要求的。假如她改變這一種政策，一定要失去全世界反侵略人們的同情心，蘇維埃政權就會失去國際正義人類的支持，這是第一個不可能。二，蘇聯和平外交政策，是社會主義國家全部根本國策之一。根本國策决不是騵騙人的。對外政策决不能脫離蘇維埃整個根本國策。——員現社會主義乃至共產黨主義的國策——而單獨存在的。它不能違反根本國策，這是第三個侵略不可能的根據。</p>
<p>以上是從理論的方面，說明蘇聯實行和平外交的理由，以下再從事實上加以證明。我們看，十月革命後的蘇聯的對外貿易，信用卓著，和各國站在平等的地位上交易，交易的目的是調劑國內的有無，决不是奪取勢力範圍，决沒有侵略的野心，中蘇，蘇土等條約，便是最有力的鐵證。</p>
<p>蘇聯為什麼要採取和平的外交政策？這個問題，已經回答了，現在談一談蘇聯和平外交政策的特質。</p>
<p>第一特質是蘇聯的外交政策不是無條件的和平。蘇聯的和平不是世界上的和平主義的和平，她不需要中國在精衛式的和平，也不需要美國孤立派式的和平，她不是阿Ｑ式的和平，而是孫總理式的和平，她不去侵略人家，也不容人家去侵略她，史達林說：「當人家的猪鼻子，伸進我們的蘇維埃花園裏來的時候，我們要用工農大衆的鐵拳把他打出去』這正如我國的抗戰一樣，在侵略强盜的行為，沒有停止以前，是談不到和平的，這就是和平本質上的矛盾，雖然表面上抗戰本身是不和平的舉動，然而平質上這正是謀取眞正和平的唯一手段，</p>
<p>第二個特質是蘇聯的外交政策不是單獨存在的，蘇聯的民族政策，經濟政策，工農聯合政策，壟斷對外貿易政策，這一切都和外交政策發生連鎖關係，現在單就民族政策來講一講。蘇聯民挨政策，對內是民族自决。各民族一律平等，國內任何民族，在史達林憲法上，有自由退出蘇維埃聯邦之權，民族自决，發展到這步田地，當然不會因民族的問題，引起國際間的糾紛。蘇聯民族政策，對外是扶助一切弱小民族。基於這個原則，蘇聯在外交上，消極方面自動取消沙皇時代的一切不平等條約；積極方面反對帝國主義的侵略弱小的行為，過去的贊助中國北伐，現在的援助中國抗戰，這都是它的民族政策的表，也就是外交政策的實行。</p>
<p>二，蘇聯一平外交的收獲及其意義</p>
<p>蘇聯的外交，可分三個時期來講。</p>
<p>第一是無外交的時期（一九一七至一九二一年初）。這一個時期蘇聯內有反革命的反叛，外有帝國主義的干涉，蘇聯求生存之不暇，根本沒有外交可言。其次是解除帝國主義的包圍，恢復國際地位的時期（一九二一年至一九三二年）。第一個五年計劃的　人的成績，完全解除了帝國主義的包園。在布爾塞維克黨的領導之下，對外逐出諸帝國主義干涉國於領土之外，對內公開的審問農民黨，實衆黨等的案件，暴露帝國主義的陰謀，尤其是法國。此外，逐出國際反蘇聯急先錄托洛斯基，更給帝國主義一個嚴重的警吿。</p>
<p>在積極的方面，蘇聯加强了他們在國聯關係上的比重，自從一九二八年以後，他們由　經濟政策，進展到社會主義的經濟建設，他們的生產增加了，他們的國力充實了，基于這一種自力更生，蘇聯在國際關係上的比重，一天一天提高起來。</p>
<p>第三是保衛整個世界和平的時期（一九三二年至現在）</p>
<p>蘇聯除了德國和日本以外，儘量的和她的，鄰居訂立互不侵犯的條約，一九三三年和斷絕交了十六年的美國，恢復了邦交，這對于蘇聯的保衛和平，增强了不少的力量。一九三四年九月，三十多個國家，邀請蘇聯加入國聯；她們不再把蘇聯當做洪水猛獸了；他們都歡迎蘇聯　誠意的和平政策。蘇聯加入國聯以後，使國聯的本質，發生了變化。過去欺騙弱小民族的國聯，從此也多少起了一種積極的和平機構作用，因為蘇聯是極勇敢而極堅决的和平保護者。一九三五年法蘇協定成立了，她更進而發起東歐互助公約，號召東歐的集體安全，雖然不幸中途流產、但是這一個提議，始終是有意義的。一九三五年蘇聯和捷克訂互助約，又和比利時復交，而比蘇的復交，表示出比國不願為德國所利用，不願做德國的犧牲品。一九三七年八月，蘇聯和中國也訂了互不侵犯的條約。這許多事實，都吿訴我們，蘇聯是積極的保衛世界和平，領導反侵略的集體安全制的。</p>
<p>三，中蘇外交的過去及其展望</p>
<p>中蘇外交的過去可分為四個階段：第一是中蘇廢除不平等條約的時期（一一九一七年至一九二四年）。蘇聯革命以後，根據她的民族政策，自動廢止帝俄時代的不平等條約，中國繼土耳其之後興蘇俄建立了互惠平等外交關係，一九二四年在化京備訂平等條約，宣佈舊約無效。其次是中蘇進一步合作時期（一九二四年至一九二七年）。這時期，中山先生努力國民革命，他積極主張聯俄，聯俄是他底三大政策之一。當時條聯也積極的援助中國，促成中國的國民革命。那時兩國的密切合作，是値得大書特書的。第三是中蘇絕交時期（一九二七年至一九三二年）。在這一個時期，中蘇雙方發生許多的誤會，外交關係一幕千丈，有時兩國邊境的繙方當屬。發生衝突，這可算楚中蘇外交的黑暗時期。最後，中蘇軍新修好的時期（一九三二年至現在）。從中蘇復交到現在，兩國的友誼又重新建築起來，從一九三二年的復交到一九三七年的互不侵犯條約，可稱為這時期底第一階段。在這一階段，雙方已經做到初步的親餐，從互不　犯條約到現在可稱為第二個階段。在這一個階段蘇聯援助我們的抗戰。援助我們抵抗法西斯强盜。顯然是大大地積極化了。</p>
<p>中蘇外交的過去，已經約略說過了。中蘇外交的未來怎樣？我們每個人都希望，蘇聯和我們能有更進一步的合作，那就是說，希望蘇聯出兵。究竟蘇聯會不會出兵呢？我們的答案是蘇聯出兵的時期還沒有成熟，蘇聯的出兵，正如孫院長說有三個前提之一，才能實行。第一個前提是蘇聯若在抗戰以前，和中國訂了互助公約，那末抗戰一起，當然它有出兵的義稅，但是事實上，中蘇過去不曾訂立這一種條約，第二個前提是國際聯盟通過一個議案，會員國可以單獨用武力援助中國，假如有這樣的議决案，蘇聯可以用會員國的資格，出兵援華。有了法律上的根據。但是事實上國聯並沒有這樣的議案。第三個前提是日本同時攻打蘇聯。日本侵犯了蘇聯，蘇聯當然出兵。但是事實上日本自從張鼓峯碰了釘子以後，她不再敢觸犯蘇聯了。以上三個前提的任何一個都沒有成熟，所以蘇聯沒有出兵的根據。總之，須知蘇聯不楚我們的雇用的衛士或總　，不能任憑我們驅使的，地有她自己的立場，國格和特殊的國際地位，我們不能對人家抱過分的奢望和依賴心，我們要希望自己，我們自身要團結得像　一　堅固，要有必勝的信念，我們有最好的領袖蔣委員長，蔣委員長是總理的繼承者，正如史達林繼承列　一樣。我們在蔣委員長的領導之下，用我們自己的力量去對付日本帝國主義，蘇聯雖然不能馬上出兵，她對于我們的援助是不成問題的，總而言之，蘇聯不論在這義上，或是在利害關係上，都是我們的一個永久的忠實的好朋友，中蘇合作更高階段終於要到來的，只要我們不屈不撓地抗戰到底。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年四月十六日至廿二日</p>
<p>四月份的第三週，又從極度緊張的空氣中過去了。</p>
<p>這一週，無論在全世界，無論在全中國，都有許多可喜的消息傳給我們。</p>
<p>譬如英法蘇聯三的會商軍事合作，美總統的提出和平計劃，反侵略陣綫擴展到遠東的呼聲，美國艦隊的駛返太平洋，英國政府的擴強遠東軍備，蘇聯的積極支持民主和平各國與援助被侵略國家，凡此都證明了和平陣綫是在以急速度發展着。反之，侵略國家，則已經表現出更多的狼狽惶恐的醜態了。</p>
<p>說到我們祖國，蔣委員長十七日發表重要談話，指出汪精衛及其黨羽的所有『反共』『和平』等主張與行動，完全是「響應×人滅華計劃的降×賣國」的主張行動，因此漢賊分明，是非大白，全國反汪運動擴大，各地政治進步，前線軍事亦獲得了更偉大的勝利，使天下皆知：日本業已降為二等以下的國家，而中華民族的力量則更進一步成為全世界反侵略保和平的主要勢力了！</p>
<p>（一）和平陣綫的發展</p>
<p>為着反對法西斯德意日本各侵略國家的加緊擴大世界大戰，民主和平各國最近醞釀組織的反侵略陣綫運動，在本週更有超速度的發展。第一，是英法蘇聯三國軍事合作問題，一週來繼續會商，已有更和洽的發展。十六日路透社巴黎電稱「法國與蘇聯土耳其的和平陣綫談判巳有滿意之進展」，十七日哈瓦斯社倫敦電稱「法正與蘇聯締結新協定，英國亦準備與蘇聯成立空軍協定。』同日路透社巴黎電又稱：『英法蘇三國卽將宣佈對波蘭，羅馬尼亞，希臘，土耳其的保證。』第二是若干小國的擁護反。侵略陣綫。十八日哈瓦斯社巴黎電稱：『英法與士耳其談判樹立東地中海集體安全制，進行極圓滿。』同日美聯社雅典電稱：『土耳其希臘兩國業經商定戰時軍事合作辦法。』十七日路透社巴黎電又稱：『羅馬尼亞巳同意必要特蘇聯加以援助之舉』，而十九日中央社倫教電也稱『英土兩國巳在土京成立土國加入集體安全組織之協定。」第三是美總統羅斯福於十五日向希特勒及莫索里尼提出和平計劃，請以十年或二十五年之期，以保證芬蘭，愛，拉，立，瑞，挪，丹，瑞士，力，盧，波，匈，羅，南，荷，比，英，愛爾蘭，法，蘇，萄，保，希，土，伊，阿拉伯，叙，巴動士坦，埃及，伊朗等三十一國的安全。羅氏這個和平計劃，立卽獲得全世界民全和平國家的擁護，甚至他的反對派亦一致擁護，對於美國積極參加與發展反侵界陣綫，發生了極大的效力。第四，是蘇聯表示决心與英法聯合，於廿一日提出四項建議，（一）東歐西歐組織反侵集團，參加各國必須成立協定，互相團結；（二）英法蘇三國當簽訂無保留的互助公約，由各該國參謀部成立協定加以補充；（三）英法向波羅所提安全保障宜修正為針對德國的保障，（四）羅波宜先成立軍約，專防德國侵略，然後蘇聯向各該國提供保障。而廿二日路透社倫教電則稱『蘇聯關於反侵略陣線之建議，確有提出遠東問題。』同電又稱』電訊報謂：蘇聯建議不僅限於歐洲。並且係在亞洲之保障抵抗侵略之制度』。這是集體安全制唯『可能的答覆，』英內閣已在研究接受了。第五是我國奧論的要求，我駐英美大使的力爭，蘇聯等友邦的援助，和我國抗戰新勝利的引起國際重視，更展開了擴大反侵略陣綫到遠東的運動，而事實上美國乒繼二　七十艘，又於最近駛同太平洋，十九日路透社倫敦電更傳出英國　彊遠東實力的計劃，表明反侵略運動必須東四　時並進。廿二日略透社倫敦電還說：『邢聯向英法提出集體安全辦法，　　推及遠東，各國各方對之極為　視，因中國可以因此獲得更多之物　援助』。</p>
<p>（二）侵略國家的狼狽</p>
<p>反侵略陣綫的超　　的發員，使　意日本等正苦於飢荒叛亂不顯佔領等內部困難之外，又受到不可　抗的外來的反擊。於是「軸心國家的狼狽」。已趣成為『舉世共見』的事實了。如　國侵略者首腦希特勒原定于他的生日本月二十日發表的答美總統詞已經延期發表，意大利侵略者首腦莫索里尼於二十日發表的演詞，則除了强詞奪理地認為美總統建議為不當以外，也不得不『預留和平之門』。而日本實力在華大量消耗，已大失德國侵略者的期望。誠如「孟斯哲德簡報」廿一日社評所稱：「日本與德國簽訂反共定協時，德國滿懷欣喜，以為從此不論對英對法對蘇，日本均為一可靠帮助。殊不知日本侵華以後，實力大減，其最明顯之事，卽為日本對德之助力遠不如兩年前！』</p>
<p>法西斯侵略國家當然不會就此『下坡』的！他們必須掙扎，以　運用一切可能運用的毒辣的武器。這一週內我們所不能忽視的事實：第一，是德意兩國企圖更密切的勾結，德航空部長戈林於十四日抵羅馬，與莫索里尼會晤。討論應付美總統電文及反侵略陣綫的發展的辦法，戈林於十七日返柏林，繽與希特等討論對策。第二，是日本侵略者的活動，十五日路透社東京電即稱：『日閣擬向英國及其他親華國家施用强硬之外交壓力。日本又擬予德意兩國以精神上之援助。』第三，是德意在反侵略陣綫未健全成立以前的加緊恫嚇。據十四十五十六三日歐洲傳出電訊，證明德意已經集中大量海軍於地中海等處，而「德國現有軍隊向波蘭及南斯拉夫兩面進發』，『意國决在　里達海增建港口』，『德國經瑞士運意的軍火日增』『德機侵入波境』『意德增兵西班牙』等等消息，更是滿佔各報國際版的地位。第四是前德國國家銀行總裁沙赫特的周遊近東各國，今又深入印度，且有東來消息，當然亦有其經濟上的陰謀作用。第五是德國之竭力拉攏羅馬尼亞土耳其，意國之脅誘保匈等國和煽動保加利亞向羅希南三國提出領土要求，而德國對波蘭更盡其誘脅手段的能事。</p>
<p>德意　三個侵略國家最近這種陰謀活動的前途如何，就要看英美法各國對於組織反侵略陣綫的誠意與决心的程度如何而定，如果英美法蘇各國無保留地團結起來，則各小國的動搖將成過去，而侵略者的屈服將為必然的事實。</p>
<p>（三）抗日戰爭新勝利</p>
<p>一週來我國抗日戰爭，繼續上週大規模發動的各綫反攻，獲得新的勝利。</p>
<p>戰事重心正向湘北移動，但本週則仍贛粵的戰事最為重要。在贛北前線，我們堅持贛那湘邊的游擊戰，我們更堅持牯嶺的游擊根據點，我們還先後克復高安，向塘，大城高郵市等地，尤其是圍攻武寧，包園南昌各役，使×軍進攻長沙的企圖遭受相當的打擊。在粵甫前線，我們於十四日攻克增　，十九日攻克從化，二十日一度攻克新會，積極向廣州之×進迫，使華南日×軍不能從容進行新的進攻的準備。</p>
<p>南北各戰場的游擊反攻，本週內都有勝利的消息傳來。山西方面，粉碎了×軍掃蕩中條山的計劃，晉南×軍受創甚重；同蒲正太各路又被我截斷，晋西以至晉北的×軍所受打擊尤重。綏遠察哈爾河北山東及隴海路沿綫，亦在第八路軍領導下獲得新的進展，如十七日美聯社上海電稱「我軍七萬圍攻徐州，一部衝入城內。八路軍亦己重佔石家莊。』此外河北的寧津，慶雲，河間，新海，任邱，　山，南宮；河南的通許，官廠，科泉；山東的泗水，新泰，昌邑，費縣，都已先後克復。而平綏，平漢，平津，津浦各路均入告斷絕。鄂皖蘇浙各地，本週亦有大捷。皖東鄂北我軍克禹王廟，迫黃安，佔九里關，迫合肥。鄂中×軍亦因我反攻而無法行動。蘇北反攻，十五日起兩淮大戰。蘇浙邊我軍亦乘×調動應付我各綫反攻之際發動奇襲，頗有收穫。此外我國空軍連日協同各綫反攻，在山西太原附近，在贛北贛江，鄱陽，洞庭，在浙江杭州一帶，在廣東白雲山等地，給×陣×軍×艦及×軍機場以重大打擊！</p>
<p>在我們新的戰略的全面實施之下，×人已經陷於被動而且大受損害。牠們目前主力雖仍在向湘省移動，企圖奪佔長沙控制粵漢路，同時分在浙閩沿海，分在潮汕及南路有所蠢動；但是牠們在戰略上已經喪失必勝的主動地位，牠們已經不得不顧慮我們的新戰略而决定其軍事部署，並且這種署部已經遭遇我們反攻的打擊了。</p>
<p>英倫『孟哲斯對衛報』廿一日社評說得對：「中國抗戰信念日堅，力量日增。而目前日本國內，縱令最樂觀的軍事領袖，仍無法預見戰事結束之期！」</p>
<p>（四）反汪×運動擴大</p>
<p>在這樣有利於我不利於×的國際情勢與　戰局面之下，而竟主張用『反共』來分散國內團結，用『和平』來停止抗戰建國，用響應×首相近衛的滅華聲明來實行對日議和投降，則其為全中中國民衆的反對與痛恨，當然毫無奇怪可言。</p>
<p>最高領袖蔣委員長於十七日在重慶與中外記者發表的重要談話，便是全中國人民公意的再一次的覆述。他再一次的聲明『中國抗戰的目的是為了保衛整個民族的生存獨立與自由，這個目的一天不能達到，我們的奮鬥一天不能停止。』『絕對無和平之餘地，絕對不是甚麼巧佞虛偽的投降理論所能動搖我們全國的决心於禹一！』他更針對汪精衛及其代日×牧買的黨羽所主張與策動的『反共和平』運動，而大聲指斥說：「有人辯解近衛聲明不是滅亡中國的條件，而以為還是可和，這不是求降賣國是什麼？乾的說，這種人不但不惜以漢奸自居，簡直是甘心作日本的奴隸了！』</p>
<p>最高領袖蔣委員長再次指定汪精衛一羣的反共和平運動為求降賣國的漢奸行動，為作日本奴隸的行動之後，全中國和全世界華僑的反汪運動，就像狂　怒濤般展開了。全中國將領和前綫將士，早曾　　　　　　江精衛及其黨羽，現在重　。桂林，上海各地，各黨派。各團體，各報社，各學校，和各界民衆，都　激怒的要求嚴勵懲處汪精衛及其黨羽。而各地華僑，亦不甘落後，除了未克發表的以外，南洋華僑陳嘉庚先生，巳經代表八百萬僑衆首先函請中央嚴懲汪×；菲律賓華僑並巳發動舉行反對×國×汪精衛大會；此外上海一百十五個同業公會並巳聯電中央表示對汪等×國活動的痛恨。中央社並已於今日（廿三日）起，對汪精衛在港所辦的南華日報，停止派送電稱。全國各地和海外僑界反汪的怒潮，巳經激騰起來了。</p>
<p>目前反汪，是提高民挨自尊心自信心以實行精神總動員的實際工作之一，是保全中國民衆的人格和提高中華民族在國際地位的實際工作之一，也就是動員全國力量和促進遠東反侵略　綫以求抗戰建國勝利成功的實際工作之一，每一個有骨氣重人格愛祖國的同胞，一定要以反汪和反對汪等策動的反共和平等××言論××行為，作為目前自救救國的實際工作。</p>
<p>我們　經一再指出。汪等遵依×人意旨而策動的反共和平，是沒有前途的，現在反共和平的陰謀再遭挫敗，牠們只有公然去做漢奸去做日本的奴隸了！連日　載汪精衛已秘密抵滬，而滬上還盛傳×前首相近衛等亦已抵滬，組織傀儡的偽中央政府，將不祗是一種空氣，而牠們今後的陰謀活動，也必有更惡毒的演出，我們還要提高警惕：「放過×人，就是殺香自己！』</p>
<p>（五）中國政治的進步</p>
<p>隨着軍事的新勝利，隨着反對汪×反對反共和平等賣國言行的怒潮，中國要從政治的更大的進步中獲得更光榮的勝利和成功，並且對於世界民主和平的大業，盡其更加光榮偉大的努力。</p>
<p>陝　寗邊區以至浙贛湘　各省臨時參議會成立或準備成立，是中國今後政治進步的信號。本週內我們又看到了關於浙江省廣東省改進黨務改　民運的計劃，及加緊動員民衆抗戰力量的施政綱領；我們也看到了關於廣西省廿八年度的施政計劃綱要，它特別着重於促進地方自治，樹立民主政治的基礎。我還看到了軍政內　敎育三部關於全國敬禮受傷將士的通令；我們更看到了推進抗戰建國大業所必需的建設公債條例和軍需公債條例的公佈。特別是我們還看到全國各地及華僑各界響應國民精神總動員運動的熱烈情形。但是所有這些，要求其完營的成功，最重要的先决條件就祗有配合着國際形勢與抗戰局面的政治上的更大的進步，戰時民衆生活必要的改善，和戰時民主政治的必要的實施。我們要用政治上更大的進步來迎接將來總反攻的實施和最後勝利的到來。廿日中央社日內瓦電傳國際人士希望於中國的眞不錯，它說：『日內瓦國際人士對我國之希望日益增强，並望中國能增强民主力量，俾將來與極權國家之力量能趨平衡。』而十八日路透社重慶電傳「中國共產黨重申基本政策，（一）國共合作，一致抗日，以建設獨立自由幸福之中國；（二）取得同情中國國家之合作，尤其取得英美蘇法各國之合作」，這不僅對於令日中國抗戰建國，並且對全世界反侵略邋動，亦有其極重要的意義。</p>

<h3>浙江·展開了政治進攻之幕　浙西行政會議之經過與收穫　（一）</h3>
<p>— 芬</p>
<p>浙江省政府為加緊游擊區的政治進攻，打擊×偽的政治侵略，在正確的决策下需要一個具體的積極的計劃，以把握抗戰中心，爭取最後勝利。特於浙西行署所在地召集了一個行政會議。這一次的行政會議，不特在浙江，就是在全國也具有非常重大的歷史意義，如果說浙西行署的成立是執行政治進攻决策之前×指揮機關，負有健全游學地區的政權，實行政治進攻，加强近×地區抗×工作，以保證政治進攻的安全使命的話，則此次所召集的行政會議就是完成浙西行署使命展開政治進攻的一個運動，他將奠定浙西抗戰的基礎，領導東南戰場軍事反攻，而在全國第二期抗戰的政略進攻中，它將發生急先鋒的領導和模範作用。</p>
<p>這次大會因為具有這樣重大的意義，所以事先經過一個多月的籌備時間。原定在大會以後接着舉行黨政軍座談會，所以召集人員除浙西各專員縣長外，並有各縣黨部，抗衛會及軍事負責人；又因為大會開幕的日子本定三月十日，所以大半出席人員都在十日以前就趕到了。那幾天正是春雨綿緜，滿道泥濘，眞苦煞了赴會來的先生們，滿身弄得拖泥帶水不算，達到後還來個住的問題沒法解决，所有旅館房間在四天以前早就容滿，後來的人急得只有找大會事務處設法，結果是一部份向學校借住宿舍，由學生借給五十條棉被，聊以禦寒。大家在上下兩層板舖的寢室內，權且做一次學生，硬板舖薄棉被，頭一兩天還不打緊，後來天氣轉冷，夜裏旣冷得睡不着。日裏還要開會，但全體人員沒有不興高采烈，充滿了苦榦的精神。</p>
<p>會議召集人浙江省政府黃主席，以遠道不及於原定開會日趕到，所以十至十一兩日改為分組審查預備會議，計第一組審查民政，財政，建設提案，第二組審查軍事提案，第三組審查民衆組訓及敎育文化提案。十二日傳言主席要到了，歡迎的人員在十點二十分就集合出發。突然的空襲警報給人以一個極强烈的刺激，結果×機並沒有來參加觀迎，而主席却於中午在衆人的熱望中從後方趕到。晚上戰時工作人員訓練班和浙省府直屬第二政工大隊，為了歡迎黃主席和到會人員，舉行了一個盛大的游藝會。</p>
<p>大會的正式開幕是十三日，這天早上八時舉行擴大紀念週和開幕典禮，所有行署附近各學校機關都全體參加，由黃主席親臨致開會詞，說明行署的使命與行政會議要務，大意可歸納為以下各點：甲，設立行署的使命：（一）為政治進攻的前×指揮機關，（二）為健全游擊戰區政權實行政抬進攻之先鋒，（三）為加强接近失陷地區的各種抗戰工作以保證政治進攻的安全。乙，行署會議之中心踝題：行政方面；（一）行政機構之調整以　全充實鄉鎭保甲為基本工作，（一二）動員民衆應以管敎養衛四大要政為準則，並以保民大會為實施起點，（三）防止漢奸加强抗戰之基本力量，（四）减輕失陷地區之非法剝奪並整理財政，（五）暢通前後方之通訊交通設備。軍事方面：（一）整理自衛團隊（二）肅淸散兵土匪保障人民之安寧，（三）努力協助軍事行動保證抗戰之勝利。經濟方面。（一）調整物產運輸活動社會金融，（二）禁止物產資×。（三）防止×貨×幣之侵入。敎育文化方面：（一）恢復各縣敎育，（二）救濟失業失學靑年，（三）充實文化機構健全文化網使文化力量深入×後。（四）防止奴化敎　育之侵入。丙，黨務方面應有之努力：（一）加强本黨領導統一行動，（一二）深入×後衷示黨員革命精神，（三）發揚三民主義堅定信仰。丁，對行署人員與會人員與政工同志之共同期望：（一）養成站在前綫一個戰鬥員所應有之精神生活行動能力，（二一）黨政軍切實合作合力對×，（三）堅忍持久完成神聖的使命。語語警策，足足說了兩三個鐵頭。</p>
<p>十三十四兩日大會都是聽取到會各單位的報吿，天氣微晴，春寒料峭會場中空氣活潑而緊張，使人有無限的興奮，各單位的報吿都係扼要詳實。</p>
<p>大會的正式討論本應在十五日舉行，後因前次提案審查未完，黃主席指示要點論飭繼續審查，於是十五日這一天又在小組討論會中過去。晚上黃主席請客，到的人當然是非常踴躍，席上並沒有酒，菜蔬也不豐盛，充滿全場的却是每個人興奮的情感。到會的人們，原佩有紅黃符號，在煤汽燈下，顯得飄飄然地更覺有趣。席間主人發言了，首先他重複地說明這次集會的機會的寳貴，然後指出從「九一八」以後所以支持全國抗戰建國的是「廬山精神」，並希望以「天目情神」，來支持東南一隅的政治進攻，末了他還朗誦自己所作的西巡天目感懷（滿江紅），詞意是：（未完）</p>

<h3>一個農民戰士之死</h3>
<p>— 史末特萊著　新聞社健存譯</p>
<p>這篇文章是富於正義感的史　特萊女士，最近從粵北寄給本港衛生局長司徒永覺夫人的，她　請居住安樂窩的西醫生們暫放下了快樂，跑到前線救治那無數為着國家民族而奮鬥的受傷兵士。——譯者。</p>
<p>今天我看見一個中國農民戰士之死，在中國有着百多萬不甘為亡國奴而獻身赴義的戰士，這個農民就是其中的一個。遺個人的死沒有世界的重要性，他不曾留下未完成的工作而為他人所不能做的，當他死了，他對國家家庭友人也不曾有遺　或勉言，他祗是靜悄悄　下了目，甚而在他　牀的傷兵，也很少知道他已經死掉。</p>
<p>這個人大約四十歲，是新四軍中一個自動投効的戰士，他是業農的，身體因為長久在飢餓中，形容很是消瘦，面目黧黑，兩個門牙都脫落了，這是另一個傷兵購的。他跟他同一樣襲擊日軍陣地，他們當時不曾知道受傷，到後來打完了仗，回到總部，才感覺着那時不能行動了，他們兩人各有一隻脚給日軍防地上所捆的竹釘所刺傷。</p>
<p>這個農民兵士靜默地臥在牀上，祗說過一聲他姓胡，是業農的，他的臉和身體每一線條都是表徵他的痛楚，他似是不停的在想念看。</p>
<p>那醫生晚「他不能生了，他太沒營養，根本沒有抵抗能力，想給他培養巳來不及了。』第三日午間，他瞌然長逝了。</p>
<p>他是四十許人，新四軍中是很少徵募老兵的，像這樣年紀的人是要養家的，打仗可徵每年靑的人。幷且新四軍是不用徵兵的，他們都是自動投效的志願軍。故此認定這個　必定是自動投效的，他是否為一個已經家散人亡的農民，他的村莊是否巳經給×人踏成平地？必然是的。</p>
<p>他在鬥爭的地方巳經給×人弄到荒蕪無人居住了。据同隊的人說，他是新近才加入的。他顯然已，經餓了許久。他的靜默，他那硬性的臉，他從眼睛中所放射出來的惦掛，都是說明他長久生活於苦楚之中，而這是不能以言語所能形容出來的。</p>
<p>我曾不斷的巡視這個亡兵所住的醫院，也曾　弔過他和那許許多多戰士之墓，我想，一個人在家庭親友或萬人空巷歡送喝采之下、踏上了征途，是容易的。在榮耀光明去赴義，知道國家將來是要記功的，我的死將來要給國人做榜樣，這樣的死也不難的，但這個姓胡的兵士，跟其他百萬像這樣的人的死，是陰暗的。沒有人為他們流淚。為他們而憑弔。在未來中國的自由社會裏，他們也沒份兒——當他們拿起槍桿的時候，他們可曾計及這些嗎？</p>
<p>他的死是醜陋的——但也是美麗的—中國的老百姓們，他們的國家所給予他們的沒有什麽，祗是憂愁和飢塞。但他們仍然能够獻其生命於國家。</p>
<p>萬千死於荒野的戰場上，萬千傷者基楚地搖搖欲墜地自望着自已的創傷，向着山路或平原公路上打望，切望有人來救助，有些支持不住的便倒斃於無葉的樹下而作永遠的休息，那些最後得到人家收容而稍為料理的，已經是倖倖不過了！</p>
<p>中國西醫生們和外國西醫生們—這些人是為着他們，化的生命為文化鬥爭而去死的，你們夜間可安睡嗎？你們不為夢魔所擾嗎？你們對着鏡子不會面紅羞愧嗎？要是這些人被打敗了，你對於你們和子孫的未能無恐　嗎？你們坐在城市里。一味利用你們的智力弄錢，我要問你們：試把你們的生命和這姓胡的無名戰士及其他百萬像他這樣的人比較一下—我現在向你們呼籲：請你們暫放下你們的撫愛，走到中國前線，在那裏應付各種問題，各種困難，各種痛心的事體，為正義而奮鬥，料理那為你們的兒子你的國家而去死的壯士，不要在歷史上留下可恥的標誌呀！</p>

<h3>中國的伏洛希羅夫　失德將軍</h3>
<p>— 蘇聯消息報Ｆ斯太霍夫作　（本報特稿）</p>
<p>二個　農，在一千八百八十六年出生於四川省儀隴縣的馬鞍莊。</p>
<p>許多年以後，這個佃農的一家，在地主的壓迫下，因為經　困難，各自流離了。</p>
<p>直到中國反專政的革命潮流澎湃之時，在一九〇七年，這個佃農，獲得一個機會，到了雲南，進了那時的軍官學校，雲南講武堂。</p>
<p>今天，這個佃農，就是著名的第八路軍的總指揮，正領着十多萬健兒在華北堵截日本侵略軍隊前進的大將。</p>
<p>這個人就是朱德。</p>
<p>一九二七年大革命之後，中國的共產黨使正式的建立起來，朱德就是這個　的領導同志之一。當時他結率他的部隊，因為組織的優越，在華南各軍中有如『鶴立　羣』。但是當時誰也沒有想到，在他的部隊裏，正有　革命的組織，而且是由他們的長官朱德親自領導的革命組織。</p>
<p>依共產黨的意見，朱德曾經一度離開了他的祖國。他化了好幾年的功夫，在歐洲研究外國語文和軍事學。他能够流利地講法，俄，德，英等幾國的語言。而且專心一致地研究馬克思，恩格斯，列寧和史達林的著作。</p>
<p>後來他囘到祖國，他曾向接近他的同志說：『現在我已學得了新的學問，我將以全部供獻給我們的革命事業。』</p>
<p>那時，中國其產滅冉度派他到華南區，當時著名的雲南軍閥范石生，立刻委任做他的參謀。范石生當時正在企圖統治華南，廣東和廣西，做他『南國的主人翁』，而以朱德做他的軍事指揮上的領袖</p>
<p>朱德似曾同意他的計劃，但也從無一時一刻放棄過組織和準備第一次革命的遠　的計劃。後來，朱德終於領了他那精銳的部隊，出發到江西，就在一九二八年四月，朱德與英勇的毛澤東兩人之間，舉行第一次的『歷史的會見』—</p>
<p>毛澤東領了他那支湖南的礦工和普通工人，以及江西的僱農與貧農組成的游擊隊開到井崗，周圍各省的逢民工人游擊隊員就像水一般的趕來了！</p>
<p>這些革命的門士們，就開始用棍棒鋤頭和刺刀等，為主義而戰了。這時候就在該處組成著名的那個紅軍第四軍團。共產黨中央委員會委朱德任這个軍團的總指揮，而以毛澤東為政治委員。</p>
<p>待此以後，『朱毛』成為中國一切報紙上的專門名詞，但是他倆領導下的部隊，從未吃過一次嚴重的敗仗。</p>
<p>當他的部隊在行軍中憩息時，朱德自己便坐在那些疲倦的士兵中間，把　經過的地方的歷史和一般社會情形，吿訴給這些「弟兄們」。在行軍中，他跟士兵們睡在同一的野營或壕溝裏。閑暇時候便向部下講述戰略和戰術、他們還隨時討論着蘇俄大革命的內戰的經騐。他那沉重而洪亮的嗓聲，是他的部下和中國革命動勞大衆所聽慣了的。</p>
<p>經過一段內戰史蹟，令天，朱德和他那忠勇的同伴們，正在執行在華北日軍後方為民埃獨立自由幸福而作戰的偉大的任務。紅軍——卽現在的第八路軍，新四軍，雖然在一年半以來的殘酷的門爭中遭遇很大的傷亡和損失，但現在遠有十多萬能習慣戰的鬥士，他們的隊伍還在逐日的廣大起來，强壯起來！——是中國抗日部隊中最健全的軍隊。</p>
<p>朱德，是中國大衆中眞正的民族英雄之一，如像現在伏洛希羅夫之對于蘇聯革命的努力一樣，他在隊伍中，被稱為中國的伏洛希羅夫。</p>

<h3>全國基督教大學會議的收穫</h3>
<p>全國基督敎大學敎育會議，於本月十七日起在本港舉行，本報曾於十九日社評謹致祝詞，並有所勉獻。該會經於昨廿二日上午閉會。綜計會議六日結果，通過議案三十三件，都是適應我國國難期間基督敎敎育方針的要案，大致上未負各方的期望，實可為該會的偉大成功，而當向出席會議諸君　致敬意。</p>
<p>這次大會通過各案的基本精神，第一是養培基督教的人格。我們認為基督教的人格，最主要的就是為保衛真理正義為拯救人類道德而不惜犧牲的鬥爭精神，這種精神正與我中華民族今日為解放中國與拯救世界和平而堅决抗日的鬥爭精神，並無二致，因此我們謹敢期許今後基督敎敎育界能够協力於民埃自尊心自信心的提高，協力于國民精神總動員的推行。第二是敎育須自由，這當然是指在×人佔領區內的敎育而言。我們希望基督敎敎育界今後務須信守這個决議，在×人佔領區以至其他特殊環境中，與×人漢奸傀儡及一切惡勢力作堅韌的鬥爭，以完成敎育自由和敎育尊嚴的原則，並且要繼續維持敎育，决不中止敎育事業。第三是忠於國家。這應當是忠於中央政府堅持團結堅持抗戰建國綱領的國策和忠於最高領袖「以革命的三民主議為今後敎育最高原則」的具體决定，我們更祈望基督敎敎育界忠誠信守這個决定，以協力推進抗戰敎育，建設新的中國，反對法西斯侵略者，保衛世界和平與人類文化。</p>
<p>此外大會還特別决定成立農村建設委員會，促進生產建設，這是目前我國抗戰建國大業中的急需，我們自　祈望基督敎敎育界切切實實盡心竭力地　助政府培植此種人材，推進生產建設事業。</p>
<p>我們對于這次大會表示極大的滿意，因此我們對於全國基督敎敎育界，不得不存要誠懇的祈望，同時還望對於有關抗戰敎育的事業，對于各地失學靑年的敎濟，對於廣大文盲的掃除，對于一切靑年救亡敎育宣傳運動的協助，盡其更偉大的助力，我們明知大會的議决和實行這種協助，是極其艱苦的，我們除了誠懇祈望每僩基督敎敎育家發揮基督教救世的精神與奮鬥必成的信心以外，我們敢斷言，全國以至全世界的興論界，將是你們忠實的後援者！</p>
<h3>歐洲無戰事</h3>
<p>— 董平</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>這些日子來，自歐洲傳來的消息，都染滿着濃厚的火藥氣味：『戰艦四三六艘集中地中海，『德意大軍雲集法西邊境』，「直布羅陀局勢緊急」，「德意將攻東南歐」，『意陰謀建立馬其頓保護國」；這一切，又把整個世界帶到了一九一四年的前夜，好像歐局又到了最取後關頭，戰爭的爆發，巳成了旦夕之間的事。</p>
<p>恐懼與驚慌，充滿世界的每憫角落；人心惶惶，不可終日，同樣的，却也有不少人在懷疑着：歐局眞的到了最後關頭了囑？戰爭眞的旦夕就會爆發嗎？我們也是這懷疑的羣。我們由懷疑，而攷慮分析，由攷慮分柝　而得到我們的結論：戰爭不會爆發；至少，我們敢斷言，在今年，一九三九年間，歐洲無戰事。</p>
<p>下面，我們願意提供我們的理由。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我們幷不否認，一些千眞萬確的事實。像：德國的靑年男女，流行地喝着：「日耳曼現在是我們的；不久之後，世界是我們的』。希特勒說：『吾人之殖民地慾望，必須達到』。意大利人民着：「還我突尼斯，進軍巴黎」。莫索里尼也說：「吾人未了之願，終必有人債來」。</p>
<p>同樣地，我們也不曾忽視，這些事實。所將引起的可能底後果。但是，我們得說，這些事實所表現的，似乎也只能　是德，意野心，赤裸裸的暴露，而决不能認為是軸心國家，將在短期內採取峻急行動的供詞。</p>
<p>我們已普遍的知道，軸心國家是不怎樣「愛好」戰爭的。他們的侵略政策，不是武力，而是「嚇詐」；不是眞正的戰爭，而是「戰爭的恫嚇」。所謂一戰爭的恫嚇」的標準方式是陳兵於境，竭力脅嚇，看準機會，以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，提出最後通牒；讓對方手足無措地。來稱樽敎就，自廿屈服。這種方式的應用，已經屢見不鮮。尤其希特勒的手法高明，無往而不利，無用而不靈。</p>
<p>雖然，德，意的侵略氣燄，已經非常煊赫；但，我們認為、他們的侵略行動，終究不是百分之百的。因為，至少，他們每次的行事，終得期待，蹟躇，看　頭，伺機會，這，我們可以自德，意過去的侵略史上看出來。</p>
<p>德，意的合手，還不過是四年前的事。一九三五年秋間，意入利開始她那久所擬定的侵略阿比西尼亞程序。莫紫里尼的運氣不怎樣好，在阿人抗拒，英，法反對及國聯制裁之下，意大利很慘的陷入了四面楚歌之境。那時的小弟弟希特勒，力量還很弱，顯然望莫能助。但終究因為民主國家的不爭氣，步伐不一致，意大利仍然併呑了阿比西尼亞。</p>
<p>至一九三六年三月，意，阿戰爭已達到了最後階段，英，法的外交官，正準備略作休息的時候，希特勒看準機會，展開了他的處女作。出兵萊茵，斷然撕毀了邏迦諾公約。英，法手足無措，吃了一次悶虧。且為以後，大開方便之門。</p>
<p>不久，西班牙內戰爆發了。德，意便公然地調軍運械，做起了西戰的後台老板——在西班牙的事，說起來總是德，意共同行動，但，實在，那又是莫索星尼祖當的——。不幸莫索里尼的運道，的確不很好，西班牙內戰不能速决，整整地拖了上千天</p>
<p>如果，我們把西戰記在莫索里尼賬上，那麽，在西戰的前期中，差不多一年多，希特助是很安靜的　當然，那是因英，法為了西戰，正跟莫索里尼找麻煩的時候。</p>
<p>到了一九三八年三月，德，意在西班牙的坐勢已成，英，法又因為徘徊不定而冷淡下來了。於是，希特勒望着良機，安肯放棄，三月十二日，一天便把奧大利　到了手。奧國原來就是德，意的禁　，莫索里尼有苦說不出，英，法自然更是閉口無言了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>香港學賑會回國務服團第一團　在南路拓荒播種</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>香港青年學生一頁光榮的跑蹟</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>…不在困難面前低頭</p>
<p>『哼！這都是香港來的什麽少爺小姐，聽說會唱歌，亦會跳舞，男男女女在一起，這個年頭眞是弄得天翻地復！</p>
<p>『知道嗎？他們這一羣是走難來的，身上有很多西紙，來到我，們鄕下，我們就衰了！敗了！』</p>
<p>當學賑會囘國服務團第一團於去年十二月廿七日從港出發到南路高州服翁的時候，他們是這樣給我們的同胞悮會着，這樣遇到了嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>內地文化低落，這是必然的現象。不在困難面前低頭，已是靑年工作者進步着的態度了。</p>
<p>他們全團二十六人（女的六人）團長是精明能幹的劉談鋒光生。在第十二區游擊司令張炎將軍領導之下工作着。除一部份留在茂名城裏工作外，大部份是到鄉下樹立工作的基礎。他們穿着跟鄉下人一樣的服裝，帮忙農人種田，勞作。男的接近男的，女的接近女的，生活漸漸與農人打成一片了。他們設了診療所，醫愈了不少的爛頭爛脚，全鄉村誰有了疾病，就知道來找他們了。有二個患着喉病的啞巴求神拜佛還沒有起色。終於亦給他們醫好了。</p>
<p>「你們眞是活菩薩啊」！鄉下人對服務圑的錯悮成見漸漸改了變。</p>
<p>…農民學校與兒童識字班</p>
<p>他們白天帮忙農人耕作，晚間就在祠堂裏設了農民學校訓練農民。口號就是「讀書識字」。內容有時事報吿，戰時讀本和歌詠，後來答應農人要求，還敎他們的珠算和寫信等等。</p>
<p>對於農村兒童呢？白天是敎他們集體游牧，講愛國故事給他們聽，敎他們歌詠。小孩子賭博的壞習慣亦從此消滅着了。晚間呢，就在祠堂裏開兒童識字班。除識字和歌詠外，主要是敎小孩子將來戰事發生時如何做情報工作。這個祠堂裏一邊是訓練成人，一邊是訓練小孩，一家男女老小一同來學習，下了課又是歡天喜地一同囘家去。祠堂是不用錢的新學校，是救亡運動的中心。服務團的朋友是農人的先生，亦是農人的兄弟姊妹。這個聽來多麼快活！</p>
<p>……展開婦女工作</p>
<p>對于農村婦女呢，因爲鄉下的封建思想還很濃厚，幹的又是廚房的工作，所以發動婦女，就沒有發動農人興發勵兒童那樣的好成績，可是。女團員對于個別訪問，以及救護常識的貫輸，還是沒有放鬆，三八節的時候，還率領她們進城參加三八節紀念大會，並有代表登檯演講。這是高州破天荒的奇蹟。這二天適逢空襲，會場都走空了，却只剩下這一隊「鄉下姑娘」肅然不動。因爲二來她們剛剛進城不懂事，二來女指導員（學賑會服務團女圑員）叫她們守秩序，她們就守秩序，鄕下姑娘的天眞純僕，給「敎育」一個高度的便利。</p>
<p>……野火會與打游擊</p>
<p>一年一度的「年例」是鄉下人最歡喜不過的。學賑會服務團就倣照舊方式，每週舉行一次全村聯歡會，在郊外燒起野火來。每個農人都喜形於色地帶着二根柴來參加。</p>
<p>嘗在一個月夜，他們組織了五十多個幹練的農人到一座高山練習游擊戰術，分爲兩隊爭奪山峯一面旗，聲東擊西，表現得十分嚴肅，十分迅速。每個農人都知道保家鄉就是保國家，很興奮地要求多敎授游擊戰術，每週要演習一次。</p>
<p>……破壞公路</p>
<p>鄉下人對於破壞公路還是躊躕不前，經過服務團的說服和親身動起鋤頭之後，農人們亦跟着幹起來了。</p>
<p>他們這樣帮忙農人耕作，替農人療病，敎農人讀書識字，並領導農人幹很多有趣的活動，農人們不僅完全克服過去錯悮的觀念。而且誠心誠意地感佩他們。鄉中的紳士說：「你們如果在這裏住多二年，我們鄕下就好了！」因爲過去的宣傳隊，工作隊那是很不切實，不能與農人打成一片。</p>
<p>……精神的安慰，無價的報酬</p>
<p>舊曆過年的時候，家家戶戶相爭邀請他們到家中過年飲酒。如有什麽「酬神」「吊燈」「……」的喜慶，一定邀他們做上賓。</p>
<p>農人們除常常送來很多蕃薯蔬菜，餅餌……給團體外，還私下送一些給他們特別親熱，特別愛戴的個人，要是婉辭，謝却的話，農人們就認爲這楚「不賞臉」而滿不高興。</p>
<p>他們開始是駐在祠堂裏低濕的地下，滿身給蚊子進攻得盡是斑點。後來究爲工作感動了農人，農人們抱歉地說：「你們千山萬水來到這裏爲着我們，我們眞是太對不住你們了！」接着就募集了很多木板和蚊帳來供應他們。</p>
<p>當幾位女同學奉命調到別處工作時，鄉下很多人哭了起來。當袁君因事離開鄉村時，很多農人圍着說：「我們因竟什麻事對不住你呢！」……</p>
<p>像這一類精神上的安慰，有錢亦買不來的報酬。實在是香港的公子哥兒所夢想不到的。</p>
<p>……偉大的任務</p>
<p>遵照專員公署戰時的組織條例，該村的農民學校將改爲自衛工作隊。兒童識字班亦將改爲兒童歌詠隊。這就是香港學生回到祖國拓荒，播種的光榮史顯。他們擬將這個中心的鄉村做得更好，以便發生摸範作用，擴展到各鄉村去。</p>
<p>至於城裏的工作亦做得很好。當局訓練各鄕自衛團新幹部就派他們担任政治工作。電白縣亦留住他們三位同志在那裏帮忙，在保衛南路，鞏固西南的神聖任務之下，學賑會服務團就是勇敢，苦鬥的前哨。</p>
<p>該圑圑員是香港前進的學生，敎師，和職員。現在學賑會每月給　們只有六塊錢，吃飯，鞋機，零用，什麼都在內。此次該幽特派代表袁　鴻黃沙兩君來港，就是來籌募全團第二期的六個月給養費約二千元。並補介藥物及人員。張炎將軍亦有函致學賑會及各圑體，表示對于服務團的謝意，並請繼續以人力物力接濟。當記者昨天聽取袁君這一席報告時，眞是無限地感　着。相信愛國的僑胞與團體，對此一定樂得伸出熱烈的手給苦幹的青年，及負有國防里大使命之南路當局以切實的帮助吧！</p>

<h3>劇本的創作</h3>
<p>— 夏衍</p>
<p>——「香港青年戲劇協會」演講稿·朱白水記</p>
<p>目前戲劇界有一個共通感到的問題，就是「劇本慌」這問題，究竟應該怎樣解　呢？讓我們談談劇本創作的問題吧。</p>
<p>不可否認的是中國現有的劇作家寫得太少了。雖則也有了很多年靑的劇作家，但是上　的節目依舊是非常的貧困，是亟需補救的。</p>
<p>我覺得我們過去似乎太把劇運　責任靑重在劇作家身上了，以爲祗要有著名的劇作家寫出來的劇本，才可以吸引觀衆，才可以討好觀衆；一定要好的劇本才去上演；一切導演，演技等等都是第二義，第三義，乃至不足輕蓬似的。</p>
<p>然而，這一來，我以為可以永遠不會有新的導演和好的演員產生，同時也阻碍了新的劇作者的成長。</p>
<p>單以新的劇作者而言，如果他辛勤地創作了一個劇本，卽使本來有上演的價値，司是因爲不够名氣，或者不够「緊張熱烈」，便永失却了十演的機會，于是他很灰心了。</p>
<p>同時，更因爲了很多人爲了要把劇本的「情節」描寫得緊張，討好觀衆，于是極力獎勵年靑的劇作者　空去幻想緊張熱鬧的故事、空空洞洞的去構造非現實的傳奇，于是很緊張，很有趣，但也很公式！</p>
<p>眞正嚴肅地去寫眞實的劇本的靑年，則永無上演的機會。而「市場」上祇有鬧劇能够存在。有了鬧劇的劇本，導演和演員等都成爲不重要　了。</p>
<p>因此，我們應當儘可能的讓新的靑年劇作者去創作，祗要他底意識是對的，故事是眞確的，那麽，劇本技巧上的不够，應當由演出者去補充。</p>
<p>本來，戲劇藝術的一大半的責任，是在導演，演員，舞台裝置等身上的；可是在中國的現在，對于劇本的要求是百份之八十，乃至九十。於是，演員和導演都沒有發展的機會，沒　用心去研究和學習的機會。</p>
<p>結果，次的上演都模仿別人一樣的　上無台去就算，這條路要不應走的</p>
<p>那麽，我們應當怎樣去創作劇本呢？</p>
<p>首先，每個準備寫作的人底態度一定要誠懇，用功，不要空想，從許多復籌錯綜的現象中去創作一種人物的典型，在廣泛而瑣碎的題材中去尋求良好的主題。</p>
<p>比方，在抗戰中我們怎樣去欲頌光明，怎樣去暴露黑暗，怎樣去觀察自己所需要的村料，怎樣去批判某一事物發生的影響……</p>
<p>這樣誠懇摯切的去寫，一定有良好的成就，從使不很成功，一定不會十分失敗。</p>
<p>在，我們要使新的劇作者的劇本，有着更多的上演機會。</p>
<p>每個靑年劇作者一定要寫自己听知的事，寫自己所十分了解的題村，因爲祗有這樣，創作出來的作品才不陷于觀念化，才不陷于公式主義。</p>
<p>過着很富有的生活的人，我以爲很難描寫窮困的人底生活；沒有到過戰地的人，沒有接觸過戰爭的人，　他去擋寫游擊隊、描寫義勇軍，我想是一定陷于幻想，陷于不眞確和概念　了。</p>
<p>但是，難道生活經驗缺少的人就不能寫作了嗎？</p>
<p>那也不一定，我們可以從書籍上、報紙上，談話上用功夫去參考，去研究，去尋求；從有關係方面去加以極深刻的觀察，去理解，把全部自己所需要的題材完全澈底明白之後，再去動筆。那總比　空亂寫好一點的。</p>
<p>在劇作手法上的運用，不一定要模仿別人，儘量地去創造新的形式，不一定要用很緊張的場面去吸引　衆，也不一定用　笑的效果去討好觀衆的。</p>
<p>靑年劇作者要拿出自信心來，寫更　實的，更動人的劇本，不要模仿前人，下一輩的人應該超過上一輩的人才對的！</p>
<p>總括一句的說，解决劇本慌不一定專希望著名的劇作家去寫作，應該盡量發掘新的靑年劇作者。同時，我們年靑的導演，年靑的演員又一切工作者都要勇敢地去演出難演的劇本。</p>
<p>——祗有　演劇本的演得好才是演出者和演員等的名譽，演好一個著名鬧劇，有什麽了不起呢？</p>
<p>應該是更深入一步的階段了！我們要進一步的去用功，進一步的磨練！因此，新的時代底新的戲劇，是要年靑的朋友來創作的。</p>

<h3>鄭重推　「抗戰特輯第六集」及其它　千萬民族英雄血寫成的史詩</h3>
<p>— 白雲</p>
<p>軍事委員會政治部　製，中國製片廠出品的抗戰紀錄影片「抗戰特輯」，由羅靜予氏所編製的第一集至第五集，都已經在香港放演過；這十幾位攝影師在戰場的前方後方出生入死歷艱苦冒危險所得的成績，不知使僑居香港，懷念祖國抗戰的中華兒女，在銀幕下流過多少熱淚！最近「抗戰特輯第六集」，已經由羅靜予袁叢美兩氏編製完竣，運來香港，不久又將在中央戲院放演．</p>
<p>記者在一次秘密試片裏，得到機會首先看到這ｇ　部三數月來的有系統的活動抗戰史。當我在看這一部影片的時候，旣然覺得光榮，又覺得慚愧！祖國的發　揚厲，抗戰情緒的高漲，壯烈英勇的中國軍隊，以及許多可歌可泣的事蹟，使人熱血沸騰，不覺淚隨聲下。它足以使人揚眉吐氣，而又感覺目己之偷安香港，不能投入祖國的懷抱，爲抗戰盡些力量，自　形穢，又不能不有「芒刺在背』之感。</p>
<p>「抗戰特輯」的價値，不僅在它有珍貴的新聞———未經報紙記載，見所未見，聞所未聞的新聞，而主要的是在它更能和用這些新聞系統地說明了抗戰大勢，加以圖表的解釋，使人一目了然于中國之必勝，×人之自掘墳墓。</p>
<p>在第六集裏包括有德安大捷，廣州武漢撤退時之最後一瞥，——不但市民極有秩序的撤退，而武漢更有留日畢生組織的服務團在各處紛刷日文的反宣傳標語，預備給將要侵入市內的×軍看，使　們在用極大的代價換取一座空城後，得到一些觸目驚心的刺激。蔣委員長所召集決定第二期抗戰大計的南嶽會議，集合了參加抗戰的二百餘位將領，以血　換來的經驗，籌商初的作戰計劃，也是使觀者特別感到興奮的。</p>
<p>還所有特約俄國攝影戰師卡爾曼攝取×機狂炸桂林的當時情景。以及該廠特派攝影師潛入×軍重圍內攝取廬山孤在牯嶺的日常生活，山項升旗，以遊擊戰打擊×人的種種情况。此外所有東西南北各戰場的前綫將領如李宗仁，白崇禧，湯恩伯，陳誠·何應欽·張發奎·薛岳·商震等，也一一在銀幕上與觀衆相見：和最前綫的戰景，都由攝影師冒險攝得，使觀者有身臨戰場之感。</p>
<p>大可注意的是那些俘虜的生活，從自然的　作中，可以看出他們內心的痛苦。在失去了戰鬥力以後，我們不僅優待他們，而且同情這些被軍閱驅使的弱者。希望他們得到新的覺悟。</p>
<p>隨着『抗戰特輯第六集』公演的還有「電影新聞」第四十八號，記述重慶節的獻金的盛况。和抗戰歌集卡通短片「募寒衣」，它把中國比較落伍的卡通片製作技巧加以漫畫式的手法，運用得非　之好，因爲歌唱有充實的內容，越發覺得動聽，也是値得一看的。</p>
<p>其次，我們應該提到參加　製「抗戰特輯」的攝　師，他們英勇的帶了開麥拉奔走在前方後方，比一個士兵携帶一枝　來作戰的任務，更爲重要，而却冒着同樣的危險，這些位攝影師是羅及之，韓仲良，劉鳴軒，姚士泉，陳晨，汪中西，李蔭，何鹿影，朱樹洪，徐芝光，徐　山，王志　，我們在這裏向他們致敬，希望他們獲得更好的成績，能使我們在下集一裏看到。</p>
<p>抗戰六輯之一慕：德安大捷勝利品</p>
<h3>緊鑼密鼓中的「黃花崗」</h3>
<p>— 秀夫</p>
<p>「黃花崗今晚總排練」，「黃花崗今晚總排練」……</p>
<p>在二十日那天，每間報紙的港聞欄都顯著地刊載着這一個引人注目的標題。</p>
<p>就在那天晚上，一個雨過天睛，飄着拂拂春意的夜風的晚傍，在華南中　底黝暗的禮堂裏，閃着無數的人擠擁地，歡笑地…到場的都全是香港的戲劇工作者呢。</p>
<p>新聲劇社。紅白劇團，中藝劇團，蘆烽劇社，旋風劇社，丁丑劇社，靑年團，中旅劇團，自强劇社，靱鬥劇圑，鐵流劇團，靑年同樂社，螞蟻劇團，先鋒劇團，時代劇團，香港靑年劇協等劇員都到得齊齊的。</p>
<p>歐陽予情，胡春冰，鍾啓南，黃凝霖，盧敦，譚國恥，唐淑明等劇連先進者也到了。在「黃花崗」這工作開始到現在，全部工作人員以這晚相叙得最齊了。這種在偉大的號召和一致的團結下而携手起來的，是如伺値得吾人感奮呵！</p>
<p>由于一再展朋演出的關係，使大家都無形地有着怠工的傾向，這自然是不好的，可是在那晚懇摯熱誠的全部工作者底相叙，又證明了每個工作底散漫是迅速可以克服的。</p>
<p>爲了時間距離演出已一天天迫近了，加强我們的工作，迅速地以突擊的姿態去完成這偉大的任務是急需的，同時爲了增加工作的效果，因此排練的時間和導演負責的分配都開始了新的週密的計劃。</p>
<p>排練的時間差不多是從廿日起天天都加緊工作了，導演的重新分配是這樣的決定：序幕胡春水，第一幕黃凝霖，第二幕歐陽予倩，第三慕鍾啓南與盧敦，第四幕是歐陽予倩興李景波，尾聲譚國恥。</p>
<p>顯然的，在導演負責上是加强了，黃凝霖，鍾啟南，譚國恥這幾位先生都是廣州戲劇界的先生進者，並且是參加過去年在廣州「黃花崗」演出時重要的工作，這次以駕輕就熟的姿態重新參加香港底演出，無疑地給予極大帮助的！</p>
<p>數日來，每天晚上不論在中藝，在華南中學，都緊張而活躍地排練着了，每個工作者都以最大的努力和熱誠的態度，在這偉大而浩舉的幌子下鬥爭着。</p>
<p>「黃花崗」這一齣民族革命歷史劇，除了在演員人數上佔一重要的要求外，它底艱鉅的舞台裝置和服裝道具等同樣是重要的，尤以工作煩難的佈景有着絕對重要性的。以前在廣州演出時，做成「黃花崗」整個工作歷程最光榮的一頁的，就是動員了無數的舞台工作者以極度强靱的力量完成它底裝置，使人永駐不忘的是一羣小英雄和我們底「老霍」——　爾。在香港，本來這艱鉅的　作也放在老　的身上，不幸，他月前病倒了，再交給一位極有能幹的葉堅先生，可是蔡楚生先生底「孤島天堂」全部佈景抓着了他，結果終于拉出紅白劇團的圑長盧景光先生來肩上這吃力不討好的工作了。</p>
<p>時間已經很匆迫是事實，在十天左右裝造四五　宏鉅的佈景本來不易的，但盧景光先生却誠意而勇敢的担起這貨任了，數日來，他完全是匆忙而緊張地指揮着開始　底任務。</p>
<p>除外，服裝在唐叔明唐醒團，道具在鍾平林勁這幾位先生負責之下開始着緊張的設計和籌備了。</p>
<p>宣傳方面也在開始着很有計劃的工作，認得在十九日的聯席會議中陸浮先生曾很週詳地買献過好的建議，數日來已在籌劃中。預算公演期中在各報張出版特刊廿多個，因此需很急，希望各劇團多撰有關「黃花崗」稿件送交宣傳部。同時將來或將印就許多很精美的美術廣吿等送發，希望對這次浩大的宣傳收到美滿的効果。</p>
<p>這裏我們可以想象到整個「黃花崗」底工作是如何地在一種緊　密鼓中開展呢，愿這次偉大底聯演把香港劇運推進到更新的階段去，把香港戲劇工作者團結到更堅强的陣線上去！</p>
<h3>武漢合唱團出國後　強化戲劇組　項堃返港羅致新人材</h3>
<p>武漢合唱團不僅僅「合唱」而已，戲劇亦是他們從事救亡運動與擴大國際宣傳之重要工具。該圑自從離港赴新嘉坡之後，公公公演四個多月，共籌得國幣三十萬元。在一百餘次之公演中，皆以「合唱」與「戲劇」相配合之姿態出現，予僑胞以極大感奮。該團現在柔佛繼續宣傳興籌欵之工作，爲强化戲劇陣容起見，該團劇劇股畏項堃特地來港羅致新戲劇人才。據項氏語記者，並未登出廣吿，不數日間報名應考者已有數十人。今天舉行考試，以對於救亡戲劇態度誠懇爲最重要標準。擬取女性二名，男性一名，本月底辦理護照後，與項氏一同首途南渡歸隊，以便繼續開展工作。項氏對記者一席談內容甚爲精采，記者寫有「武漢合唱團在新嘉波」一文，因本期稿擠，當俟下期發表。</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>教會生歌詠戲劇比賽昨晚舉行培道冠軍</h3>
<p>本港基督敎學生團，爲培育學生藝術天才，和救濟一般流亡學生與難童起見，特于昨廿二日下午七時假座聖士提反女校禮堂舉行歌詠戲劇比賽大會。內容分歌詠戲劇兩組，參加戲劇組者，有嶺南附中，培道女中靑年會，女靑年會巾幗華光圑等。由該圑敦請蔡楚生，費穆金山，王瑩等先生担任評判。結果，冠軍爲培道女中青年會，劇目爲　衍之「贖罪」。亞軍兩名，一爲嶺南附中的「月亮上升」，一爲女靑年會巾幗華光團的「血魂」，演出成績都非常美滿。</p>
<p>兒童劇協大會　今日下午一時舉行</p>
<p>香港兒童戲劇協會是本港各兒童戲劇團體的最高統一組織。自經螞蟻，先鋒，强中，中央，學賑，靑年同樂等兒童劇團積極籌備後，一切工作均甚　力。聞已定於今天下午一時　座中華兒童書院召開全體大會，決定一切工作進行，並繼續要求未參加的兒童團體參加。這是香港見童運動與戲劇運動的新生機，我們謹以全誠祝其健康地生長起來。</p>
<p>真光女中劇團　前日在靑年會公演</p>
<p>眞光女中各級劇團，每週經常輪流於靑年會公演，一方面擴大救亡宣傳，一方面提倡戲劇大衆化，用意至美至善。歷次演出，成績甚佳，亦頗爲社會人士所讚譽。前天（廿一日）該校初中三年級生又在　靑年會大禮堂第三次公演國防話劇一我是中國人」，「民埃公敵」及「烙痕」等三個獨幕劇，及勝利神歌劇，全體觀衆甚爲感動。</p>
<h3>七回一次的演出</h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>寫在前面</p>
<p>我們從上海出來，到今天已經二十個月了。隨着整個的抗戰形勢的進展，話劇在這期間是有着可驚的成績的。牠深入了大衆之間，牠受着廣大農民與士兵的愛戴，在各地，在窮鄉僻壤，在前方，都看見一羣羣戲劇工作者，穿着破舊的衣服，赤着脚，抬着簡單的道具，隨處張開他們的營壘，——田野，山峯，樹木茂密的處所，戰壕……熱烈地表演着。</p>
<p>在這裏應該特別提到的是這些新的戲劇前哨，都是些中學生，靑年的知識份子，他們勇敢地替新中國的新興話劇，開闢了一條光明的大道，一條建設的成長的大道。整個的話劇前途，是寄托在他們身上的。</p>
<p>抱愧的是一向從事於戲劇工作的人，參加的反倒很少。</p>
<p>我們在這個偉大激流裏，和這些純潔而熱誠的朋友們工作在一起，我們從他們那裏，學習了很多，尤其是一種新的精神，一種勇於向眞理邁進不怕艱難困苦的勇敢。在這裏，使我很深地懷念着在六別山裏的一羣，他們從靑島，北平，各地囘到他們的老家，商城，完全捨棄了原有的一切生活，投到農民的隊伍裏去；他們一百多人都是些優秀的中學生大學生，女的也和男的一樣參加了各種工作。譬如寫慰勞信，那麽他們一上午的工夫就動員了全縣的人民踴躍地參加了。他們耐着性子，受着熱情的驅使，克服了一切玩固和可怕的困難。淸道夫，散工，一切雜役；老百姓們做的，他們都做。現在，他們是在重山疊嶺的大別山裏，和着游擊隊一同地幹了！當我們離開新建拗的山峯時，他們寫了一面小旗子送給我們，陪我們走了十多里，日本××大砲在我們耳中淸晰地饗着，在新店的小市鎭上我們分了手，他們擠在一堆，喊着說：「不要忘記我們呀！」我們同轉頭看着他們，立在土坡上揮招着手的，黑臉的，破爛的一羣，在我們心裏湧上了無限惜別和歡喜！他們，他們是中華民族最優秀最勇敢的兒女！</p>
<p>出發到今天，我們演出過七百四十一次，鄉村的演出佔去四分之二，其餘的四分之一是小城市及縣鎭，再其次是大城市；我們走過了八個省份，接觸過各種不同的觀衆：現在想把我們工作的經歷，及在工作中所感受到的困難（演出方面的），略揀幾個實例，寫一點出來，想也是朋友們所願意知這的吧。　（未完）</p>

<h3>中國金銀政策之行程</h3>
<p>— 傑</p>
<p>戰時財政政策中的貨幣政策、在沒有實行通貨會理的時代、是改　硬幣、减低貨幣的價値、以增財源、在實行通貨管理的現代、則施行通貨膨脹、以資運用，但中國並沒有走向通貨膨脹的途徑、而以增加稅源發行公債配合運用起來、作爲戰時財政的第一要策、以收集金銀政策的進行、去增加戰時財政的力量、前日本報載二十一日財部通電禁止銀錢業私購金銀而定一收購辦法、可說是搜集金銀政策的進行已到最高峯了、</p>
<p>白銀因爲在一九三五年十一月三日已經收爲國有、所以在戰時金銀政策進行最力的還是黃金的收集、主要的方法是、一九三七年十月十日公布的金類　換法幣辦法和施行細則、規定以生金、金噐、金幣或新產之金塊、金沙等兌換法幣者、給以百分之三至百分之五的手續費，購救國公債的加給百分之六、作爲法幣存欵的照新定利率加給週息二釐、其次一九三八年十一月一日公佈監督銀業收兌金類辦出、規定銀樓業收進或售出赤　及九成金原金等槪以具有飾物器其的形狀爲限、金條、金塊、金葉、沙金、礦金一槪不准收售、至專以收買沙金、礦金的店舖應向中央銀行接洽訂立受委託合同、悉數轉片中央銀行、同年十一月中更限制私運黃金及任何形狀的金飾出口或運往淪陷區、輔助的方法是：在救國公債募集辦法中規定國幣、硬幣、外幣、生金銀等、在金公債中規定生金或金幣等得購買公債、</p>
<p>以上主要的輔助的辦法對於金銀的收集、可說已很詳密、不過中國在　行法幣政策時、對於以六成正貨、四成保證向發行銀行領用法幣的辦法、幷未廢止、故在戰時收集金銀政策的進展上、不無缺陷——主要辦法中雖於收購運輸有明確的規定、但對於藉名收　充作領券準備的一點、是沒有　到、所以財部電令金融業、規定各地銀錢業曾向中、中、交、農四行締結領券合約的、因而收購金銀充爲準備的、應先報明接洽領券的發行銀行、並報請牧兌金銀辦事處、照案委託辦理、仕絕投機或走　的弊端、假使未經締結領券合約、又不報請委託的、則以私購牟利論，按情節的不同、酌爲處分、此項辦法、要關涉到發行銀行和收　金銀辦事處的兩個機關、當然不易發生弊端、則對於投機或走私、自易於防止或杜絕、　（未完）</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>甲組足球爭標戰　南華南榮獲冠軍　雨中作戰四比零大破海軍　南南大勝是運用避重就輕戰略的成功</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天雖不是滂沱大雨、却下得很濃密、一般足球迷民、覩此沉悶天氣、老不高興、而怨天不造美、都恐怕那幕甲組联賽爭標戰、或會因此衍期、卽不然的話、球人們在雨中角逐、至低限度也會减少精彩的演出、</p>
<p>還有許多人、兀自替南華南祖憂、爲的是南南各員的球藝、雖則個個吹彈得響、但體力不如洋人、乃係一樁毋庸否認的事實、而且海軍中人習慣水上生活、因此理想到他們對於足球、也曾利於水戰、故在此種環境中、生怕南南凶多吉少、加以海軍的陣容、極爲完整、人强馬壯、似爲本年來所罕見、</p>
<p>人們越替南南担憂、越欲一知其究竟、所以冒雨觀戰的、總有五六千人以上、把整個海軍埸的座位、佔踞迨盡、還展開一個「有遮」大會、的是奇觀、</p>
<p>在競賽中、南南各員運用超卓的本事、演出精伶巧美、聯絡盡致、雖則塲濕球重、未免吃力、然對皮球控制有方、傳供得法、故在此種技術優良的情勢下、卒跑上勝利之途、以四比零殺得洋水兵全軍皆墨、</p>
<p>我看出南南此次大勝、唯一主因、乃避重就輕的成功、關于這點、分明是技巧的作用、蓋南南前綫各員的身段俱不及洋水兵那麼健碩、若不是運用技巧以謀出路、而欲專靠力量、這不可能、南南諸鐸能够當走空位、避開海軍守將的截擊、復故弄玄處、引誘他們、搖動其防衛的重心、使工夫最穩健的軒地、也兼顧不來、於是乎海軍不得不大敗了、</p>
<p>轉地乃任左內衛、演出最兇、可是他越英勇、越易入圈套、爲的是南南於開賽不久、黎遙榮因右足創痛、卽與華北華對調位置、而前綫進攻亦側重於右路、恒地適當具衝、未免忙於應付、不得不違出擊、而其此舉、正中了南南前綫避重就輕之計、故當被北華從中引誘、把他調離出來，遂給于馮景祥乘隙而取的機會、試看景祥所勝三球、每一次扣門時站立的位置、均離軒地較遠、而迫門殊近、遂顯見南南前線的作戰策略、是避重就輕、亦是避重乘虛、</p>
<p>前鋒共獲四球、而景祥獨居三只、功勞固大、但別要忘記北華扶助得力、其功亦不小、北華的好處、在於傳運妙美、與景祥極盡合作的能事、若果兆榮不是扶傷登場、三鋒間互傳的聯絡更佳而無疑了、</p>
<p>景祥的技術、確已登峯造極、且能見機行事、智謀俱備、自兆榮創痛不良於行的時間、他卽改變戰略、側重與南華力面謀進取、復以一已之力、設法彌補兆榮所應走而不走的位置、還有一事頗稀奇的、經七十分鐘刺戰、個個都弄得滿身泥醬、馬景祥的制服、很少汚點、因他跑得穩、立得牢、述中三元、未曾跌過一交、確實難能的事、</p>
<p>羅料文在此役中的演出、頗足稱道、比諸以前、生色許多、鄧盧森最近表演已在顯峯狀態中、昨戰亦然、可稱當今港中第一名右翼、兆榮因舊創作痛、無善足述、然勝第二球是他間接之功</p>
<p>南南的前衛綫、下半時演出比上半時來得到週、助守方面、以郭英祺、梁榮照有大功、助攻力面、亦得力這兩人、惟榮照所犯故意做作的毛病、不可不改、昨戰因此而被裁判員上名、雖屬太過、但榮照又何必故意弄出事來呢、劉慶才也算努力、不過很難制肘岩士德郎及鍾士的活動、然他不慣於居左、故應有原諒之處、</p>
<p>李天生及李國威、上半時屢次救險、轉危爲安、能保凈勝、不失一球、的是勞苦功高、包家平亦多佳作、</p>
<p>海軍大敗原因、固由於守衛方面的硬派功夫、實不足以抵禦南南諸鋒有戰略的進展、然其三前衛在上半時演出、却是不錯、一進一退似有哥靈登的作風、內衛軒地與哥連臣亦甚兇勇、惟他們祗以力制人、終至疲乏、又比不上南南諸鋒頭腦精靈、故至下半時卒陷崩潰之勢、</p>
<p>前鋒幾沒一個擅射、雖有機會亦致錯過、在上半時當南南屬受威的脅時候、如其前鋒帶有射門鞋、說不定南南會先敗、</p>
<p>幾手遺漏了一件事，得在這裏補說幾句、英祈在昨戰中、釘着拖般死不放、弄到拖般發作不來、看來英祺的身段、合比拖般小一半、地却能運用着巧妙的技術，把拖般制得一籌莫展、眞是難能可貴、</p>
<p>現在海軍旣敗、得不到冠軍、連亞軍一席也生問題、因爲東方亦賽足二十場、得廿九分、正與海軍地位相同、尙須多來一決亞軍决賽、方定難屬、東方今日已由西貢返施、與海軍決賽之期、當在不遠、到時東方有許文奎曹秋亭等効力、軍容甚整、說不定能克海軍而得亞軍、但戰期未定、且代下回分曉、昨戰兩軍排陣如下</p>

<h3>上半時戰况</h3>
<p>（十分鐘）兩軍相持極劇、岩郎士德得後方之輸運、快馬刦營、迫得角球、開出後、他能于人叢中疾進、向門猛射、其勞異常兇險、天幸生橫脚一掃、救球出險</p>
<p>（十五分鐘）榮照這球于北華、北華賺過韓尼維路、轉遞廣森、廣森猛射、被軒地擋之出界、得一角球、廣森主踢、美妙玲瓏、惜景祥撥高。</p>
<p>包家平力救危球（原真攝）</p>
<p>（十七分鐘）斗文勇氣陡增、盤球急進、在海軍陣地衝刺、失而復得、在門前咫尺、獨力掃射、中的架臣之身彈出、兆榮再射、角度甚佳、但去勢不勁、復爲的架臣救出、</p>
<p>（仕分鐘）榮照刦得金卑路之球、傳與兆華、盤運而上、妙交廣森、高路士攔截不來、負一角球、廣森開來、其勢美妙、景祥於人頭攢動中、輕搖銅頭、球卽滾入綱內、（一比〇）</p>
<p>（廿二分鐘）岩士德郎活潑異常、又得機向南南門角抄進、幸慶材及時囘師、併命攔阻、寧負角球、岩士德郎主踢落對、無功而退、</p>
<p>（廿三分鐘）摩利士秉南南後防空虛之際突然挺進、國威夫守、家平棄門出戰、摩利士脚頭不靈、有空門而不射、竟將球打落荒野、</p>
<p>（卅分鐘）海軍再度猛襲、巨人拖般在南南門前進擊、家平死抱球兒、及時踢出、轉瞬間、金卑路又在門角苦苦壓迫、爲勢甚兇、惟家平鎭靜從事、抱球脫險、</p>
<h3>下半時戰情</h3>
<p>（五分鐘）兆榮得景祥之妙傳、過關斬將、發足播射、球向海軍城門疾進、哥連臣舉足一擋、送班落野、負角球、幾乎倒戈</p>
<p>（十五分鐘）海軍據球進攻、十分鐘之內、苦煞南南守衛、及至韓尼維路犯規時、危機始過、已而哥連臣犯規、兆榮主踢任意球、景祥在海軍腹地迎球一頂、再中紅心、（二比〇）</p>
<p>（廿三分鐘）國威踢一遠球、景祥衝前奪得、有如脫韁之馬、狂奔而前、他能、高路士及軒地等雖三面截擊、亦告無效、卒被景祥一氣呵成、獨取一城、（三比〇）、</p>
<p>（卅三分鐘）南南穩健從事、不以完場將至而少懈其力、廣森又于急攻中、送一妙球、北華臥地一射、建立一功、至是遂成四比〇之數、南南得錦標、</p>

<h3>怎樣練習捷泳</h3>
<p>— 潘叢柏</p>
<p>身體差不多能够浮出水面上來的、再加四肢的運動、浮得更高、也能前進了、初學游泳的明乎此、只要別畏艱辛、很易學會、還進步得極速、下肢動作要直伸起來、勿忘却膝部會受水和下肢的衝擊就把下肢屈伸着打水、而下肢打小的力量是發自大腿關節活動的、因此、下肢很易疲勞、初習時、要從簡入繁、先做下肢的動作、頭俯着、上肢依然合力前伸、浮着的軀體會因下肢交互打水的動作完全浮出水面上來、</p>
<p>上肢動作、常這隻平要向首前入水時、那隻手又在腰側抽出水面上來了、及它出水後、入水的手也就揷到水中去、在水中的上肢微灣着、向後推去、和水發生互相抵抗的作用、如艇之以槳划進似的、下肢不斷交相上下打動、上肢又配合運用、捷泳的姿勢還只少了呼吸的動作罷了、</p>
<p>呼吸的動作、這在水上和空中的有別、日常呼吸以空氣從鼻孔通過爲最合、而游泳時却以口吸氣、鼻呼氣爲最適用、爲什麼要以鼻呼氣呢、捷泳動作由於上肢的交相爬動水中、頭部就要順勢續向左右兩邊微側、須雖捷泳的頭部位置會因其餘動作的運用的不同而有高低之別、但總在部頭還未向側斜置前呼氣、卽它正對前邊時便把餘氣呼出來、準備頭部向側露出水面上時以口深吸一口巨量的氣、如不用口吸之、在動作迅疾的短促時閒、斷難吸進够用的空氣、假設呼氣水中而不是經由鼻孔的、那就易給水衝進口腔裏去、呼吸動作、馬上受碍、</p>
<p>下肢、上肢、和呼吸的動作不只要在水中練習、每晨操的時候、因爲在陸上的動作做來較易支持、除分作各部份動作的練習外、練習全部的動作、進步更易、怎樣演出如上的動作、在此未便詳叙、惟呼吸的練習、除不必助以用具外、在洗臉時利用臉盆的水練習起來、就宛如在水中練習似的、</p>
<p>練習捷泳的動作已如上述、不過它並不容易熟習、不只不易熟習、還很辛苦的、這得立下最大的决心、然後才能克服困難、値得注意、更不能一曝、寒地學習、否則三數年也不能把它學諳了、並不希奇、</p>
<p>其次、常捷泳學會了、總還覺得呼吸迫促、動作很易疲乏、還不到三五丈的距離、就得力竭而氣不繼了、又將怎辦、</p>
<p>氣與力之不能持久、與體魄的强弱固然有關呼吸動作未能暢用和肌肉的運用不得其法影響尤大、因爲要把頭部取得適宜的呼吸的位置、往往把頭提得過高和左右擺動的太烈、前者的弊端把肢體平浮水中的力量改變了、增加下肢支持浮勤的困難、後者影響呼吸、不惟身軀隨亦左右搖動、有碍前進、還覺頸部易于疲倦、又會累及呼吸的不便、</p>
<p>所謂肌肉的運不得其法、指四肢不斷運動之間、未能獲取竭息消勞的機會而言、不特易感疲乏、更無從發揮准體前進的猛烈力量、實在是增進泳技的大碍、</p>
<p>不論四肢動作怎樣的、它旣有與水發生相抗的作用、也就不致沒有與水不相抗的動作、這動作是間續的、游泳動作雖然不停、倒有一勞一息的機會、下肢打水後再向上引、上肢於水中抽出來準備再揷入水中去的時間、都是肌肉賴以休息的良機、那就要把肌肉鬆置起來、動作自是比較緩和柔順的、</p>
<p>遝是要勤習中才能把捷泳的技術增進、體察自身的魄力和游泳技術如何、每次游泳的時間和距離遞增下去、更要注意姿勢會因長期的練習而把劣點擴起來、那是不易矯正的、亦惟有正確的姿勢、泳技才易進步、（二）</p>

<h3>文藝攻勢</h3>
<p>— 黃繩</p>
<p>一方面是嚴肅的工作，一方面是荒淫興無恥，這句話又正好是此時此地文化界的寫照，文協香港分處的成立，開始了進步的文藝工作者的團結，是這裏文化界釗時期的大事，它將成爲策動文化鬥爭的一個機構，作爲成員的工作者也將更積極的更勇敢的提供他們的力量，——這代表了嚴肅的一面。</p>
<p>而就在這時候，某派在更湍底的出賣人格，更澈底的背叛祖國，更澈底的效忠×人，積極收買報紙，收買落後文人，更大量的散播毒素，更巧妙的製造黑幕，更無恥的造謠撞騙，搖惑人心，祖國不容他們立足，此地便成爲他們的魔窟，——這代表了汚穢的一面。</p>
<p>光明對黑暗的搏鬥，應該是到了最緊張的階段！</p>
<p>就文藝界方面說，工作者已開始了團結，現在是發揮集體力量的時候，我們一方面要有計劃的有系統的發動一個研究的運動，一方面要馬上負起宣傳大衆，打擊漢奸的任務，——隊伍已經齊集，有蓬勃的生氣，有鮮明的戰旗，親在要佈下一個「攻勢」。</p>
<p>團結，爲的進攻，不單是防守！</p>
<p>要建立一個攻勢，我覺得，首先要檢閱一下自己的隊伍，我們要來一個切切實實的自我檢討，我們的生活有沒有不嚴肅的地方？我們的工作有沒有不良的傾向？我們的寫作有沒有在客觀上便宜了某派，這就是說，我們有沒有迎合一些人的低級趣味？工作者之間，要彼此幫助，彼此了解；還要互相勸勉，互相督促。</p>
<p>其次，現在集來的工作者還不多，我們不能承認少數工作者便能充滿地担當目前的艱鉅的任務，一方面是無數文藝靑年要在文藝戰旗的樹立中加上一雙手，一方面是這無數文藝靑年的確可以成爲文藝戰綫的幹部。督部是攻勢中的最勇敢的戰鬥員，何况我們的戰鬥將不局限於這一隅之地，還要把戰鬥的觸角探進內地，或者探進離祖國更遠的地方，大量幹部的爭取和訓練，更是當前的任務。</p>
<p>再次，在這策動攻勢的時候，我們還要向落後的一羣。進行政治的工作，落後者沒正確的認識，他們的工作便宜着某派，也比較容易爲某派所收買，所以對于這一羣人，要取消輕蔑和不理會的態度，要設法把他們爭取過來，還有，就是誤入羅綱的，也未必盡無正義感，有時或因職業關係，背着良心做些醜事，我們要瓦解仇方的營壘，也要促這些人快快覺醒。</p>
<p>攻勢的建立和發展，自然是件艱鉅的工作，在上面談的祗是一些要項項，也許目前更要緊的是已集合起來的工作者的配置，那些担任這一方面的出擊，那些担任一路綫的進攻；還有是工作者武器的使用問題，那些最適合使用步槍，那些最適合使用手溜彈，或許還應該有人使用一些刀槍劍戟舊法寶。</p>
<h3>初到火綫的一晚</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>拖着被飢餓和疲乏征得軟綿綿的身體，從師部的指揮所裏跨了出來，憑着來時的一點淡薄的經騐，我們都以爲可以換索回去的。不想，才走出門來不遠，我們都迷失在被黑暗籠罩着的遼闊無邊的原野裏了。</p>
<p>我們的右前方照耀着一片怕人的通紅的火光，點綴着無數亮晶晶的小星的深湛的碧空，也被那猛烈的火光烘紅了。槍砲聲不停的密密麻麻攪做一團，就像要把被黑暗籠罩着的這世界撕毀了去似的，在這震耳的混亂的檢聲裏，那像敲砧板似的機關槍聲顯得非常之淸晰噠噠噠……：</p>
<p>「怎麽走呢？」</p>
<p>「我記得：來時我們經通一條堤岸，怎麽現在會走到這些麥田裏來？速路也沒有，你着，怎麽走？」</p>
<p>「當心！不要走到×人的防綫裏去，要曉得這裏已是前經上了！」</p>
<p>經過一度小小的商議，大家決定仍囘到師部指揮所裏去。在黑暗中模着走了不遠，忽然，一個傳令兵從指揮所裏走了出來，便價着我們囘到石拉去。</p>
<p>路上什麽也看不清，我們緊緊的一個跟一個的摸索着前進。但兩脚常給什麽東西阻住，幾乎跌到地上去。有時，兩脚又陷到一些泥塘裏去，使你拔也拔不起來。</p>
<p>晩風帶着幾分寒冷，一陣陣的風吹着，田裏的那些麥苗瑟瑟的在搖動着，就像有×人從田勇走過來了似的。默默的走着，但一面睜大眼睛舉行着警戒。</p>
<p>槍砲聲仍熱鬧的在響着，那通紅的大光仍那末燦爛，那末炫耀，就像太陽初出來的那頃刻。</p>
<p>通過了警戒綫。好容易回到我們住的那間小小的房內來了。推開門進去一看，房內滿給十多個同志一東個西一個的睡滿了。</p>
<p>「嘿，你們的飯還沒有吃？」還沒有睡着的那唯一的女同志，穿着她那件花呢大衣，從一綑高梁桿上爬了起來迎着我們問。</p>
<p>「沒有吃，你們的吃過了？」</p>
<p>「吃了！」她簡單的囘答了一句，便從棹子上托起一籮乾冷飯來遞給我們；「趕緊吃！趕緊吃！」</p>
<p>我們嚼了一口乾冷飯，再也嚥不下去了。貧吃的望着她，「有沒有菜。」</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>「有沒有鹽？」</p>
<p>「也沒有！」</p>
<p>「呵！」大家不由得笑起來了。</p>
<p>狼吞虎嚼的嚥了兩口飯，算是吃過飯了。但怎麼睡呢？這末多人在一處，而且還雜着一個女同志！</p>
<p>這女同志姓湯，據說，當我們的伍駐紥在江西德安時，她便毅然丟棄了家庭，學校，投到我們的部隊裏來，這難得的事情，那時，還在江西報紙上大登而特登過。對於這一個年青的女同志，雖然別的人因爲她工作能力而對她懷着一漠視的態度，但我對她是非常敬佩的，自從抗戰發生到現在，佔着全人口二萬二千五百萬的女同胞，像她這樣犧牲一切到前線來的，試問有幾個？單就這一點，我就覺得她是値得敬佩的。</p>
<p>「起來，重新鋪一鋪才好睡。不然，這麼多的人怎麽睡？」</p>
<p>「起來，不願做抆隸的人們！……」湯同志滑稽的唱起義勇軍進行曲來，這使被睡眠襲擊着的人們不由得笑起來了。</p>
<p>東一個，西一個，正好睡着的人們，不願意的爬起來了，大家才把棹子及那堆家具什物搬開，各人便忙把預備好的灰毡鋪在地上，湯同志也在這熱鬧的競爭下。在靠近大門的一邊，把灰毡在地上鋪了起來。什麽地方都給灰毡鋪滿了，但我的灰毡還拿在手裏沒有地方放下。</p>
<p>「我睡的地方呢？」</p>
<p>「湯同志旁邊不是還可以睡嗎？」大家像做了一件甚麽得意的事情，似的望着我吃吃的只是痴笑着。</p>
<p>「那裏……」我被笑得難爲情起來了，不由得也跟着他們傻笑着，房裏充滿了年靑人的元氣旺盛的笑聲。</p>
<p>看着湯同志的那種無拘來的坦然睡在那裏的樣子，我觀舰的也把灰毡鋪下去了。出乎我的意料之外，笑聲也便隨着消滅下去了。房裏就只聽得門外的那砲聲猛烈的在響着……</p>
<h3>「吃砒霜藥老虎」</h3>
<p>— 華父</p>
<p>天下的聰明人是死不絕的。他們說：第一要損人利己：第二要利己利人：第三要——不，第三要不得了——，第三不要損己損人：至於第四，祖已利人，只有大下的大痴子才肯如此，更其要不得！總之，聰明人是他有的獨特精神的，自己要生不要死，甚至不得已而求其次，不能好好地生，也當惡惡地生，總不願好好地死．他們說，好死不如惡活，於是乎，吃砒霜爾老虎，乃成爲他們所嘲笑的對象。</p>
<p>他們遇見老虎，一定供以豬羊。滿足老虎的食慾。猪羊沒有了，老虎對他們熟視着，似乎欲得而甘心，他們至多躱避决不敢抵抗。他們說，老虎是何等巨物，豈敢去動一動它的毫毛，自討苦吃。假使看看逃不開呢，他就就只有跪到地上，哀哀求吿，卽使到老虎張口要吞他們時雖然手裏有砒霜，還不肯望自已嘴裏塞進去，而希望自己終究能够做一個「虎口餘生」。可是這種人的結果，我們是可想而知的，不過給老虎當一頓並不見情的點心罷了。</p>
<p>天下任何聰明人，也許不會看見老虎要吃他，果然就笨到如此地步。然而天下正有這樣的聰明人，看見和老虎一般要制其死命的危機，要逃逃不了，要打打不過，終不敢慷慨赴義以一死相拚。他們只想哀求，確實在做着「與虎謀皮」的勾當。他們說，生存爲第一要件；两敗俱傷是不値得的。</p>
<p>他們夢想與老虎「共存共榮」；他們以爲老虎也有人性，可以和它講情理；他們更以爲即使被老虎吃了，自己還可以作另一方式的生存——作倀鬼。得到老虎主子的任用。因此，他們自以爲理論圓滿，事實週到，自己早就立於不敗之地，只要向老虎求和，這樣也可以生，那樣也可以生，惟有抵抗老虎，在他們看來，却是末路。</p>
<p>其實老虎也者，往往是「紙老虎」，一加戮穿，醜態畢現，卽使不是紙老虎，也不過是「狗頭老虎」，憑它的本能，也只會偷偷猪羊，到底沒有吃人的膽量和力量，只要人看見了就與以迎頭痛擊！任何武器都行，不一定要快槍。假使它眞是一頭金睛白額的大蟲，的確會吃人，那我們就該拚命的打。</p>
<p>我讚美那打些老虎的精神。有了這種精神，我想假使虎而有知，也當退避三舍。聰明人的嘲笑是預備作倀鬼的。我們旣不預備作根鬼，管什麽嘲笑！我們本此精神，根絕了虎患，就可以看見聰明人的嘲笑落到他們自己的頭上了。</p>
<h3>夢之海</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>在春天，邢湯柔之神，作一陣和風，將我送入夢之海！</p>
<p>我在夢之海中飄蕩，駕着那鮮花般之小舟，任意駛向東西！</p>
<p>夢之海偉大啊！這是一個極樂的世界，有着人類中所有沒有的珍寳，那裏有珍珠島，玫瑰林，美麗的烏兒掠過天空，活潑的魚兒，在海底，躍，那淸澄的海水，從無波瀾；這夢之海，充滿了愉快的空氣！</p>
<p>小舟向前進行着，到了另一界世界，那海水是黃色的，那裏的天空，佈滿了灰色的雲翳，港中的魚兒，呆呆地躱在水中，這是多麼愁慘，多麼凄凉！</p>
<p>小舟，祗要有着去路。她不會停止的。那夢之海的一端，是個可怕的世界，雷雨，暴風，將波濤掀起，好似山嶺，小舟停留不着了，。中的大魚，張開血盆似的口，吞沒一切！</p>
<p>可怕呵！夢之海。我不願再投身在裏了！</p>
<p>我鼓着氣。奮勇地將小舟搖，這可怕的世界！</p>
<p>那夢之海，茫茫無際，小舟的力量，永遠找不出陸地，</p>
<p>我祇有咬緊了牙，屏着氣，從舟中向空中躍去。</p>
<p>夢之海，這虛幻的漩渦，我再也不投入你的懷抱中了！</p>
<h3>劉二殺賊（抗戰大鼓）</h3>
<p>— 敬昔</p>
<p>長白山頭積雪深，黑龍江畔流水淸。傍山依水有個農人名劉二，年年種麥勤耘耕，冬種夏熱一年四季樂，日出而作日入停。恨只恨××海賊無端來侵犯，兵到之處都變了荒村。女被强姦男被害，這個劉二被海賊拉去扛軍火，日夜鞭打就像牛馬不像一個人。一天隨軍出發到了宿遷城門外，鬼子列陣就紮營。</p>
<p>我軍飛機空中響，砲聲震耳如雷嗚；忠勇將士一聲喊，賊兵紛紛烏獸奔。劉二眼看賊兵散，愛國的心腸油然生：說說時遲來那時快，手奪倭槍就打賊兵，四週賊兵多如海，劉二那裏放在心。遠的放槍近的刺，連殺賊兵無數名；一面殺來一面喊：「建功殺賊在如今！」聲聲喊叫飄四野，被迫的伙夫齊淚零，頓時奮起賊營內，殺聲遍地震山林。一面伙夫在後面動槍兵，賊兵腹背都被困，砲火之下了殘生。錦繡河山依舊歸中國，我軍慶祝盡歡欣。這就是劉二殺賊一件事，願同胞愛國愛家子子孫孫抗寇兵。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>她在似睡不睡的神態中，有時用被蒙起頭來，有時把手脚丟在被外，有時拖長着哼聲，嘆聲，斷續的哭叫聲。她這不安的睡眠，是雪擾的嗎？不是的，滿洲的雪，是擾着安於滿洲睡眠的睡者的。</p>
<p>她淸醒過幾下，每次都是揚起頭來，探望一下窗下，然後，把頭又睡落在枕上。因為滿洲的雪夜，還在窗外。這夜，在她感受還是生來的第一次長夜。</p>
<p>她醒來的時候，天還不明；因爲附近工廠的汽笛響了，開始命令工人開動機輪，順便喚醒了她。</p>
<p>窗外的雪，飄落了一夜，還不停止。路上的積雪，已經在一尺以上，往日的高牆，又短了幾尺。雪似乎怒了。</p>
<p>陰森的晨色，在黑暗中，漸漸地開朗。松花江邊被暴風還未打斷的旗竿上，又將飄起叛了組國的旗子，滿洲的雪就是爲它而怒了的吧？</p>
<p>她在不安中起來，帶着比未睡更甚的疲倦，走到窗邊。內窗被火牆溫暖得明晶如常，外窗讓寒冷凍起了厚厚的霜花；她向外探視的視綫被隔在霜花以內。她打開內窗，用氣息溶化了外窗的一團霜花，投過視綫去。窗外的往日的街頭，在朦隴的色調中，依然是熟識的；那最熟識的家門，却隔遠了，遠在天外一般，縱然夢想畏了翹膀，也難飛往。她想衝破外窗，己不顧窗下的高度，可以一躍跳下；無奈外窗被長釘釘牢。往日已經走厭了的家門，現在却引起她的想念。僅僅是一夜的隔離竟像千百年來的長久，那麽，未來的遙遙的歲月，何日是終了……她不敢想了，再想下去疲倦的旅人的長途。人的渴望，是愈想愈遠的。</p>
<p>後來，她在床上，比較安定地陲去了。她這種的睡態，就像一條無家的野狗，在流亡的途上，借宿於陌生人家，拘緊着肢體，有着不安小動作，冒昧，担心，恐懼，仍然留在睡的神情中。　（四五）</p>

<h3>On Soviet Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Regarding the question of "Soviet Diplomacy," I would like to divide it into three parts:</p>
<p>1.  The objective basis of Soviet diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>2.  The achievements and significance of Soviet peaceful diplomacy in recent years.</p>
<p>3.  The past and prospects of Sino-Soviet diplomacy.</p>
<p>1. The Objective Basis of Soviet Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>(I) Observing from the socio-economic system, the Soviet Union has no need for foreign aggression.</p>
<p>1. The Soviet Union's production is not for private profit; the Soviet Union is a socialist country, different from capitalist countries. Socialist production pursues not the interests of a few, but the welfare of the masses. Capitalist countries do the opposite; their sole goal is to pursue the profits of capitalists. Based on this difference, the two diverge in their foreign policies. Capitalist countries, in order to pursue profits, have to strive for foreign markets to sell their goods; have to seize the resources of other countries to supply their raw materials; have to develop foreign investments to utilize their capital, and directly exploit the masses of backward nations. In short, for the sake of profit, under their continuous exploitation, the domestic market shrinks day by day, so they have to expand their influence abroad. Country A expands abroad, and Country B also expands abroad; Country A excludes Country B, and Country B also excludes Country A; in the end, they are bound to resort to force, causing war! Look at the tense situation in the international arena today; what is it for? It is for capitalists to compete for greater sources of profit! Soviet production is not for private profit; the development of Soviet wealth and production is accompanied by the improvement of the welfare of the entire people, and the continuous growth of the purchasing power of the masses, so there is no need for foreign aggression. Its relationship with other countries does not have the kind of contradiction that exists between imperialist countries in their competition for colonial markets. Therefore, it does not need to use war to deal with other countries; it only needs to maintain equal economic relations with other countries through peaceful and friendly means. This is a theoretical basis for analyzing that the Soviet Union does not need foreign aggression from the socio-economic system.</p>
<p>2. The Soviet Union has no contradiction between production and consumption. The purpose of Soviet production is to improve the enjoyment of the masses and increase the material construction. Everyone in society enjoys the same protection. Capitalist countries do the opposite; they sacrifice the happiness of the majority for the profits of a few. Their national wealth increases day by day, and the pockets of their oil magnates, car magnates, and whatnot magnates are filled day by day, but their people become poorer day by day. That is to say, on the one hand, a few are rich, and on the other hand, the majority are poor; on the one hand, machines and factories increase, and on the other hand, unemployment and bankruptcy are widespread. The result is a sharp increase in production but a sharp decrease in purchasing power. This contradictory phenomenon forces capitalist countries to invade abroad. The Soviet Union is completely different; their national wealth increases, and their social welfare also increases with it. The third five-year plan, as recorded in the newspaper, has already told us that the living standards of the Soviet people are progressively improving along with their productivity. The sharp increase in wage rates, the addition of universities, the prevalence of nurseries, public hospitals, and maternity convalescent homes all prove that the increasingly affluent lives of the people and the rapid development of productivity have achieved a balanced speed, which cannot but be attributed to their planned economy. We look at the world economic panic from 1929 to 1933. In imperialist countries, there was overproduction, soaring unemployment, bankrupt shops, and a plummeting purchasing power of the people. However, in the Soviet Union, there was no unemployment phenomenon before 1932. In the world economic panic, it not only did not suffer any blows, but also continued to prosper. During the first five-year plan period, the feeling of a shortage of goods was indeed due to the fact that industry could not be fully developed, but the increased purchasing power of the people was also a major factor. In short, the Soviet Union has no contradiction between production and consumption; sometimes demand even exceeds supply, so it has no need for aggression. In the Soviet Union, from the highest leader to the lowest-level ordinary people, are all laborers. Although there is still a distinction between mental and physical labor, raising the national cultural level will surely break the gap between mental and physical labor, and surely make everyone an engineer and a scientist. At that time, their working hours will be reduced, and the time for research and entertainment will be increased. In other words, the consumption of the general public will gradually increase. Consumption increases with the increase in production, and the phenomenon of contradiction between production and consumption will not occur at all, and therefore foreign aggression is not necessary. This is another theoretical basis for analyzing that the Soviet Union does not need foreign aggression from the Soviet socio-economic system.</p>
<p>(II) The dictatorship of the proletariat is also an objective basis for the Soviet Union not needing foreign aggression. The socialist economic system is inseparable from the dictatorship of the working class. If the capitalists of the Soviet Union still exist and still hold the power, then the socialist economic system of the Soviet Union will not work. Because the Soviet Union is ruled by the working class, it can protect the current socio-economic system, and the socialist labor regime and the socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible with aggression.</p>
<p>(III) Observing from the objective basis, the Soviet Union's foreign aggression is impossible: First, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has been embraced by the entire people because it is in the interests of the entire people. If there were a madman in the Soviet Union who wanted to invade China, I think the entire Soviet people would definitely execute him. The people's opinion is like this, and the Soviet government is elected by the people, so of course it cannot violate the will of the people. This is the first impossibility. Second, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has been sympathized with by the international community because it is in line with the requirements of all just people in the world. If she changes this policy, she will definitely lose the sympathy of anti-aggression people all over the world, and the Soviet regime will lose the support of international just people. This is the first impossibility. Two, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy is one of the fundamental national policies of a socialist country. Fundamental national policies are by no means deceptive. Foreign policy can never be separated from the entire fundamental national policy of the Soviet Union—the national policy of realizing socialism and even communism—and exist independently. It cannot violate the fundamental national policy. This is the third basis for the impossibility of aggression.</p>
<p>The above is from the theoretical aspect, explaining the reasons for the Soviet Union's implementation of peaceful diplomacy. The following will further prove it from the factual aspect. We see that after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's foreign trade has been highly reputable, and it trades with various countries on an equal footing. The purpose of the transaction is to regulate the domestic supply and demand, and it is by no means to seize spheres of influence, and it has no ambition for aggression. The treaties between China and the Soviet Union, and between the Soviet Union and Turkey, are the most powerful ironclad evidence.</p>
<p>Why does the Soviet Union adopt a peaceful diplomatic policy? This question has already been answered. Now let's talk about the characteristics of Soviet peaceful diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>The first characteristic is that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy is not unconditional peace. The Soviet Union's peace is not the peace of world pacifists. She does not need China's Jingwei-style peace, nor does she need America's isolationist peace. She is not an Ah Q-style peace, but a Sun Yat-sen-style peace. She does not invade others, nor does she allow others to invade her. Stalin said, "When other people's pig noses stretch into our Soviet garden, we will use the iron fists of the workers and peasants to beat them out." This is just like our country's war of resistance. Before the behavior of aggressive robbers stops, there is no talk of peace. This is the contradiction in the essence of peace. Although on the surface, the war of resistance itself is an unpeaceful move, in essence, this is the only means to seek true peace.</p>
<p>The second characteristic is that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy does not exist independently. The Soviet Union's national policy, economic policy, worker-peasant alliance policy, and monopoly foreign trade policy are all linked to diplomatic policy. Now let's talk about the national policy alone. The Soviet Union's national policy is national self-determination internally. All ethnic groups are equal. Any ethnic group in the country has the right to freely withdraw from the Soviet Union in the Stalin Constitution. With national self-determination developed to this point, it will of course not cause international disputes due to ethnic issues. The Soviet Union's national policy is to support all small and weak nations externally. Based on this principle, the Soviet Union, in its diplomacy, automatically abolished all unequal treaties of the Tsarist era in the passive aspect; and opposed the imperialist aggression against weak behaviors in the active aspect. The past support for China's Northern Expedition and the current assistance to China's war of resistance are all manifestations of its national policy, which is also the implementation of diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>2. The Achievements and Significance of Soviet Peaceful Diplomacy</p>
<p>Soviet diplomacy can be divided into three periods.</p>
<p>The first is the period of no diplomacy (1917 to early 1921). During this period, the Soviet Union had counter-revolutionary rebellions internally and imperialist intervention externally. The Soviet Union was so busy seeking survival that it had no diplomacy at all. The second is the period of lifting the imperialist encirclement and restoring international status (1921 to 1932). The outstanding achievements of the first five-year plan completely lifted the imperialist encirclement. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, it expelled the imperialist intervention countries from the territory externally, and openly interrogated the cases of the Peasant Party, the Realization Party, etc. internally, exposing the conspiracy of imperialism, especially France. In addition, the expulsion of Trotsky, the international anti-Soviet vanguard, gave imperialism a serious warning.</p>
<p>In the active aspect, the Soviet Union strengthened their proportion in the League of Nations. Since 1928, they have progressed from the economic policy to the socialist economic construction. Their production has increased, and their national strength has been enriched. Based on this self-reliance, the Soviet Union's proportion in international relations has increased day by day.</p>
<p>The third is the period of defending the entire world peace (1932 to the present)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, except for Germany and Japan, tried its best to sign non-aggression treaties with her neighbors. In 1933, it resumed diplomatic relations with the United States, which had been severed for sixteen years, which greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's defense of peace. In September 1934, more than 30 countries invited the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations; they no longer regarded the Soviet Union as a flood beast; they all welcomed the Soviet Union's sincere peaceful policy. After the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, the nature of the League of Nations changed. The League of Nations, which had deceived small and weak nations in the past, has since played a somewhat active role as a peaceful institution, because the Soviet Union is an extremely brave and extremely determined protector of peace. In 1935, the Franco-Soviet agreement was established, and she further launched the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, calling for collective security in Eastern Europe. Although it unfortunately aborted midway, this proposal is always meaningful. In 1935, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia signed a mutual assistance agreement, and resumed diplomatic relations with Belgium. The resumption of diplomatic relations between Belgium and the Soviet Union showed that Belgium was unwilling to be used by Germany and unwilling to be a victim of Germany. In August 1937, the Soviet Union and China also signed a non-aggression treaty. These many facts tell us that the Soviet Union is actively defending world peace and leading the anti-aggression collective security system.</p>
<p>3. The Past and Prospects of Sino-Soviet Diplomacy</p>
<p>The past of Sino-Soviet diplomacy can be divided into four stages: The first is the period of Sino-Soviet abolition of unequal treaties (1917 to 1924). After the Soviet Revolution, according to her national policy, she automatically abolished the unequal treaties of the Tsarist era. China, following Turkey, established a reciprocal and equal diplomatic relationship with Soviet Russia. In 1924, an equal treaty was signed in Beijing, declaring the old treaty invalid. The second is the period of further cooperation between China and the Soviet Union (1924 to 1927). During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen strived for the National Revolution. He actively advocated alliance with Russia, and alliance with Russia was one of his three major policies. At that time, Tiao Lian also actively assisted China and promoted China's National Revolution. The close cooperation between the two countries at that time is worth writing about. The third is the period of Sino-Soviet severance of diplomatic relations (1927 to 1932). During this period, many misunderstandings occurred between China and the Soviet Union, and diplomatic relations fell sharply. Sometimes, the border between the two countries belonged to the side. Conflicts occurred, which can be regarded as a dark period of Sino-Soviet diplomacy. Finally, the period of Sino-Soviet military reconciliation (1932 to the present). From the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union to the present, the friendship between the two countries has been rebuilt. From the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1932 to the non-aggression treaty in 1937, it can be called the first stage of this period. In this stage, both sides have achieved preliminary harmony. From the non-aggression treaty to the present, it can be called the second stage. In this stage, the Soviet Union has assisted our war of resistance. Helping us resist fascist robbers is obviously greatly activated.</p>
<p>The past of Sino-Soviet diplomacy has been roughly described. What about the future of Sino-Soviet diplomacy? We all hope that the Soviet Union and we can have further cooperation, that is to say, we hope that the Soviet Union will send troops. Will the Soviet Union send troops after all? Our answer is that the time for the Soviet Union to send troops has not yet matured. The Soviet Union's dispatch of troops can only be implemented if it has one of the three premises mentioned by President Sun. The first premise is that if the Soviet Union had signed a mutual assistance pact with China before the war of resistance, then of course it would have the obligation to send troops once the war of resistance started, but in fact, China and the Soviet Union have never signed such a treaty in the past. The second premise is that the League of Nations passes a resolution that member states can use force alone to assist China. If there is such a resolution, the Soviet Union can use its status as a member state to send troops to aid China. There is a legal basis. But in fact, the League of Nations does not have such a resolution. The third premise is that Japan attacks the Soviet Union at the same time. If Japan invades the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will of course send troops. But in fact, since Zhanggufeng met a nail, she no longer dares to offend the Soviet Union. None of the above three premises have matured, so the Soviet Union has no basis for sending troops. In short, we must know that the Soviet Union is not a guard or a general employed by us, and cannot be driven by us. It has its own position, national character, and special international status. We cannot have excessive expectations and dependence on others. We must hope for ourselves, and our own strength must be as solid as a fortress. We must have the belief of victory. We have the best leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the successor of the Premier, just like Stalin is the successor of Lenin. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, we will use our own strength to deal with Japanese imperialism. Although the Soviet Union cannot send troops immediately, its assistance to us is not a problem. In short, the Soviet Union, whether in this righteousness or in terms of interests, is always our permanent and loyal good friend. The higher stage of Sino-Soviet cooperation will finally come, as long as we persevere in resisting the war to the end.</p>
<h3>One Week of World Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From April 16th to 22nd, Year 28</p>
<p>The third week of April has passed amidst an atmosphere of extreme tension.</p>
<p>This week, both globally and within China, there have been many heartening news items.</p>
<p>For example, the consultations on military cooperation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the U.S. President's proposal for a peace plan, the calls for extending the anti-aggression front to the Far East, the return of the American fleet to the Pacific, the British government's strengthening of its Far Eastern military presence, and the Soviet Union's active support for democratic and peace-loving nations and aid to countries under aggression—all of these demonstrate that the peace front is developing rapidly. Conversely, the aggressive nations have already exhibited even more embarrassing and panicked appearances.</p>
<p>Speaking of our homeland, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered an important speech on the 17th, pointing out that all the "anti-communist" and "peace" propositions and actions of Wang Jingwei and his cohorts are entirely "responding to the × people's plan to destroy China through surrender and selling out the nation." Therefore, the distinction between loyal and traitorous subjects is clear, and right and wrong are evident. The nationwide anti-Wang movement has expanded, political progress has been made in various regions, and the military at the front has also achieved even greater victories, making it known to all under heaven that Japan has already been reduced to a second-rate nation or lower, while the strength of the Chinese nation has further become a major force in the world against aggression and for the preservation of peace!</p>
<p>(1) Development of the Peace Front</p>
<p>In order to oppose the intensified expansion of a world war by fascist, German, Italian, and Japanese aggressor nations, the movement among democratic and peace-loving nations to organize an anti-aggression front has experienced even faster development this week. First, regarding the issue of military cooperation among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, consultations have continued over the past week, leading to more harmonious developments. A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 16th stated, "Negotiations between France and the Soviet Union and Turkey regarding the peace front have made satisfactory progress." An Havas dispatch from London on the 17th stated, "France is preparing to conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union, and Britain is also preparing to establish an air force agreement with the Soviet Union." On the same day, a Reuters dispatch from Paris also stated: "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are about to announce guarantees for Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey." Second, several small countries are supporting the anti-aggression front. An Havas dispatch from Paris on the 18th stated: "Negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey to establish a collective security system in the Eastern Mediterranean are proceeding very smoothly." On the same day, an Associated Press dispatch from Athens stated: "Turkey and Greece have agreed on measures for military cooperation in wartime." A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 17th also stated: "Romania has agreed to the measure of providing assistance to the Soviet Union when necessary." And a Central News Agency dispatch from London on the 19th also stated, "Britain and Turkey have concluded an agreement in the Turkish capital for Turkey to join the collective security organization." Third, U.S. President Roosevelt proposed a peace plan to Hitler and Mussolini on the 15th, requesting a guarantee for the safety of thirty-one countries, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, Ireland, France, the Soviet Union, Portugal, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iran, for a period of ten or twenty-five years. Roosevelt's peace plan immediately received the support of all peace-loving nations around the world, and even his opposition unanimously supported it, having a tremendous effect on the United States' active participation in and development of the anti-aggression front. Fourth, the Soviet Union expressed its determination to unite with Britain and France, putting forward four suggestions on the 21st: (1) Eastern and Western European countries should organize an anti-aggression bloc, and participating countries must conclude agreements to unite with each other; (2) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an unreserved mutual assistance pact, supplemented by agreements established by the general staffs of each country; (3) The security guarantees offered by Britain and France to Poland should be revised to target Germany; (4) Romania and Poland should first establish a military pact specifically to defend against German aggression, and then the Soviet Union would provide guarantees to those countries. And a Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd stated that "the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the anti-aggression front does indeed raise the issue of the Far East." The same dispatch also stated, "The 'Daily Telegraph' says: The Soviet proposal is not limited to Europe, and it is a system for guaranteeing resistance to aggression in Asia." This is the only "possible answer" to the collective security system, and the British cabinet is studying its acceptance. Fifth, the demands of Chinese public opinion, the strong advocacy of our ambassadors to Britain and the United States, the assistance of friendly nations such as the Soviet Union, and the international attention garnered by our country's new victories in the War of Resistance have further launched a movement to expand the anti-aggression front to the Far East. In fact, the United States continued to send seventy ships and recently dispatched them to the Pacific. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th even reported on Britain's plan to strengthen its Far Eastern power, indicating that the anti-aggression movement must advance simultaneously in the East and West. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd also said: "Xinglian proposed collective security measures to Britain and France, extending them to the Far East, and all countries and parties view this with great importance, as China can thereby obtain more material assistance."</p>
<p>(2) Embarrassment of Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>The ultra-rapid development of the anti-aggression front has caused Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries, already suffering from internal difficulties such as famine, rebellions, and insignificant territorial gains, to face external counterattacks that cannot be resisted. Thus, the "embarrassment of the Axis powers" has become a "universally acknowledged" fact. For example, the speech by Hitler, the head of the German aggressors, originally scheduled for his birthday on the 20th of this month, has been postponed. The speech delivered by Mussolini, the head of the Italian aggressors, on the 20th, while forcefully arguing that the U.S. President's proposal was inappropriate, also had to "leave the door open for peace." Moreover, the large-scale depletion of Japanese power in China has greatly disappointed the German aggressors. As stated in the "Münchner Neueste Nachrichten" editorial on the 21st: "When Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany was overjoyed, believing that Japan would be a reliable help against Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Little did they know that after Japan's invasion of China, its strength was greatly reduced. The most obvious thing is that Japan's assistance to Germany is far less than it was two years ago!"</p>
<p>Of course, the fascist aggressor nations will not simply "go downhill" like this! They must struggle and use every possible vicious weapon they can. The facts that we cannot ignore this week are: First, Germany and Italy are attempting even closer collusion. German Aviation Minister Göring arrived in Rome on the 14th to meet with Mussolini, discussing ways to deal with the U.S. President's message and the development of the anti-aggression front. Göring returned to Berlin on the 17th and discussed countermeasures with Hitler and others. Second, the activities of the Japanese aggressors. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th stated: "The Japanese cabinet plans to exert strong diplomatic pressure on Britain and other pro-China countries. Japan also plans to provide spiritual assistance to Germany and Italy." Third, Germany and Italy are intensifying their intimidation before the anti-aggression front is fully established. According to dispatches from Europe on the 14th, 15th, and 16th, Germany and Italy have concentrated large numbers of naval forces in the Mediterranean and other areas, while "Germany currently has troops advancing towards Poland and Yugoslavia from both sides," "Italy has decided to build more ports in the Lirida Sea," "The amount of German military supplies being transported through Switzerland to Italy is increasing daily," "German planes have invaded Polish territory," "Italy and Germany are increasing troops in Spain," and other news items are filling the international pages of various newspapers. Fourth, Hjalmar Schacht, the former president of the German Reichsbank, is touring various countries in the Near East and has now penetrated into India, with news of his coming east, which certainly has its economic conspiracy role. Fifth, Germany is making every effort to woo Romania and Turkey, while Italy is coercing and enticing countries such as Bulgaria and Hungary to incite Bulgaria to make territorial demands on Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Germany is also exhausting its means of enticement and coercion towards Poland.</p>
<p>The future of these recent conspiratorial activities of the three aggressor nations, Germany, Italy, and Japan, depends on the sincerity and determination of Britain, America, and France in organizing the anti-aggression front. If Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union unite without reservation, then the wavering of the smaller nations will become a thing of the past, and the submission of the aggressors will be an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>(3) New Victories in the War of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Over the past week, our country's War of Resistance Against Japan has continued the large-scale counter-offensives launched on various fronts in the previous week, achieving new victories.</p>
<p>The focus of the war is moving towards northern Hunan, but this week the battles in Jiangxi and Guangdong remain the most important. On the northern Jiangxi front, we are persisting in guerrilla warfare on the Jiangxi-Hunan border, we are further holding onto the guerrilla base at Kuling, and we have successively recovered Gaoan, Xiangtang, Dacheng, Gaoyou City, and other places. In particular, the sieges of Wuning and the encirclement of Nanchang have inflicted considerable blows on the enemy's attempt to attack Changsha. On the Guangdong front, we captured Zengcheng on the 14th, Conghua on the 19th, and briefly captured Xinhui on the 20th, actively pressing towards the Japanese in Guangzhou, preventing the Japanese forces in South China from calmly preparing for new offensives.</p>
<p>Guerrilla counter-offensives on various fronts in the north and south have brought news of victories this week. In Shanxi, the enemy's plan to sweep through the Zhongtiao Mountains was crushed, and the Japanese forces in southern Shanxi suffered heavy casualties. The Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Railways were again cut off by our forces, and the Japanese forces in western and even northern Shanxi suffered particularly heavy blows. In Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, and along the Longhai Railway, new progress has also been made under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army. For example, an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th stated, "Our army of 70,000 is besieging Xuzhou, and part of it has broken into the city. The Eighth Route Army has also reoccupied Shijiazhuang." In addition, Ningjin, Qingyun, Hejian, Xinhua, Renqiu, Cangshan, Nangong in Hebei; Tongxu, Guanchang, Kequan in Henan; and Sishui, Xintai, Changyi, Feixian in Shandong have all been successively recovered. The Beiping-Suiyuan, Beiping-Hankou, Beiping-Tianjin, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways have all been reported to be cut off. Major victories have also been achieved in various regions of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang this week. In eastern Anhui and northern Hubei, our army captured Yuwang Temple, pressed Huang'an, occupied Jiuliguan, and pressed Hefei. The Japanese forces in central Hubei are also unable to act due to our counter-offensive. The counter-offensive in northern Jiangsu began with a major battle at Huai'an and Huaibei on the 15th. On the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, our army also launched surprise attacks while the enemy was redeploying to cope with our counter-offensives on various fronts, achieving considerable gains. In addition, our air force has been cooperating with counter-offensives on various fronts in recent days, inflicting heavy blows on enemy positions, enemy troops, enemy warships, and enemy airfields in the vicinity of Taiyuan in Shanxi, in northern Jiangxi, Gan River, Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, in the vicinity of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, and in Baiyun Mountain in Guangdong!</p>
<p>Under the comprehensive implementation of our new strategy, the Japanese have fallen into a passive position and suffered great losses. Although their main force is still moving towards Hunan Province, attempting to seize Changsha and control the Yuehan Railway, and at the same time are stirring along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, in the Chaozhou-Shantou area, and in the southern route, they have strategically lost the initiative to win. They have had to consider our new strategy in determining their military deployments, and even these deployments have been met with the strikes of our counter-offensive.</p>
<p>The "Manchester Guardian" editorial on the 21st was correct in saying: "China's belief in the War of Resistance is becoming stronger day by day, and its strength is increasing. And currently, even the most optimistic military leaders in Japan cannot foresee the end of the war!"</p>
<p>(4) Expansion of the Anti-Wang × Movement</p>
<p>Under such an international situation that is advantageous to us and disadvantageous to the enemy, and under such a war situation, to advocate using "anti-communism" to divide domestic unity, using "peace" to stop the War of Resistance and nation-building, and using responding to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's declaration to destroy China to implement peace talks and surrender to Japan, it is of course not surprising that they are opposed and hated by the entire Chinese populace.</p>
<p>The important speech delivered by the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to Chinese and foreign journalists in Chongqing on the 17th, was another reiteration of the public will of the entire Chinese people. He once again declared that "the purpose of China's War of Resistance is to defend the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. As long as this goal is not achieved, our struggle will not stop for a single day." "There is absolutely no room for peace talks, and absolutely no cunning, hypocritical, or surrendering theories can shake the determination of our entire nation in the slightest!" He further addressed the "anti-communist peace" movement advocated and promoted by Wang Jingwei and his cohorts who had been bought off by the Japanese, and loudly denounced them, saying: "Some people argue that Konoe's declaration is not a condition for the destruction of China, and think that it is still possible to make peace. What is this if not seeking surrender and selling out the nation? Frankly speaking, such people not only do not hesitate to regard themselves as traitors, but are simply willing to be slaves of Japan!"</p>
<p>After the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, once again designated the anti-communist peace movement of Wang Jingwei and his group as a traitorous act of seeking surrender and selling out the nation, and as an act of being slaves of Japan, the anti-Wang movement of all Chinese people in China and overseas has unfolded like a raging torrent. All Chinese generals and frontline soldiers had long denounced Wang Jingwei and his cohorts, and now reiterate their views. In Guilin, Shanghai, and other places, all parties, groups, newspapers, schools, and people from all walks of life are indignantly demanding severe punishment for Wang Jingwei and his cohorts. Overseas Chinese in various places are not willing to lag behind. Apart from those that cannot be published, Mr. Chen Jiageng of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese has already sent a letter on behalf of eight million overseas Chinese, first requesting the central government to severely punish Wang ×; Overseas Chinese in the Philippines have also launched a rally to oppose the × country × Wang Jingwei; In addition, one hundred and fifteen trade associations in Shanghai have jointly telegraphed the central government to express their hatred for Wang and other × country activities. The Central News Agency has also, starting today (23rd), stopped sending telegrams to the Nanhua Daily, which Wang Jingwei runs in Hong Kong. The angry tide of anti-Wang sentiments across the country and among overseas Chinese has surged up.</p>
<p>Currently, opposing Wang is one of the practical tasks of raising national self-esteem and self-confidence to implement a spiritual mobilization. It is one of the practical tasks of preserving the personality of the Chinese people and enhancing the international status of the Chinese nation. It is also one of the practical tasks of mobilizing national strength and promoting the Far Eastern anti-aggression front to achieve victory in the War of Resistance and nation-building. Every compatriot with backbone, who values personality, and loves the motherland must take opposing Wang and opposing the anti-communist and equal ×× rhetoric ×× behavior promoted by Wang and others as the practical work of saving oneself and saving the country at present.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out that the anti-communist peace promoted by Wang and others in accordance with the will of the × people has no future. Now that the conspiracy of anti-communist peace has been frustrated again, they can only openly become traitors and slaves of Japan! For days, news has been carried that Wang Jingwei has secretly arrived in Shanghai, and it is also rumored in Shanghai that former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and others have also arrived in Shanghai to organize a puppet central government. This will not just be a rumor, and their future conspiratorial activities will surely have even more vicious performances. We must remain vigilant: "Letting go of the × people is tantamount to killing ourselves!"</p>
<p>(5) Progress in Chinese Politics</p>
<p>Along with the new military victories, along with the angry tide against Wang × and against anti-communist and equal traitorous words and deeds, China must obtain more glorious victories and successes from greater political progress, and make even more glorious and greater efforts for the cause of world democracy and peace.</p>
<p>The establishment or preparation for the establishment of temporary councils in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and even in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan is a signal of China's future political progress. This week, we have also seen plans to improve party affairs and reform people's movements in Zhejiang Province and Guangdong Province, and policies to intensify the mobilization of the people's strength for the War of Resistance. We have also seen an outline of the administrative plan for Guangdong Province in the 28th year, which particularly emphasizes promoting local autonomy and establishing the foundation of democratic politics. I have also seen the joint order from the military, political, internal affairs, and education departments regarding the nationwide salute to wounded soldiers; and we have further seen the promulgation of the regulations on construction public bonds and military supplies public bonds, which are necessary to promote the great cause of the War of Resistance and nation-building. In particular, we have also seen the enthusiastic response of various regions across the country and overseas Chinese communities to the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. However, for all of these to achieve complete success, the most important prerequisite is only to coordinate with the greater political progress in the international situation and the war situation, the necessary improvement of the people's livelihood during wartime, and the necessary implementation of democratic politics during wartime. We must use greater political progress to welcome the implementation of the general counter-offensive and the arrival of the final victory in the future. The Central News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 20th conveyed the genuine expectations of international figures for China, saying: "International figures in Geneva are increasingly hopeful about our country, and hope that China can strengthen its democratic forces, so that the strength of totalitarian countries can be balanced in the future." And the Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th conveyed "the Chinese Communist Party reiterated its basic policies: (1) cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan, to build an independent, free, and happy China; (2) obtaining the cooperation of countries that sympathize with China, especially obtaining the cooperation of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France." This is not only of extremely important significance for China's War of Resistance and nation-building today, but also for the anti-aggression movement worldwide.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang · Unveiling the Curtain of Political Offensive: The Process and Gains of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Conference (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fen</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to intensify the political offensive in the guerrilla areas and combat the political aggression of the puppet regime, needs a concrete and proactive plan under the correct policy to grasp the center of the War of Resistance and strive for final victory. Therefore, an administrative conference was convened at the location of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office. This administrative conference is of great historical significance not only in Zhejiang but also in the entire country. If the establishment of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office was the front-line command organ for implementing the political offensive policy, responsible for strengthening the political power in the guerrilla areas, implementing the political offensive, and strengthening the anti-Japanese work in the adjacent areas to ensure the safety of the political offensive, then the administrative conference convened this time is a movement to complete the mission of the Zhejiang Western Administrative Office and launch the political offensive. It will lay the foundation for the War of Resistance in Western Zhejiang, lead the military counter-offensive in the Southeast Theater, and play a leading and exemplary role in the strategic offensive of the second phase of the War of Resistance nationwide.</p>
<p>Because this conference had such great significance, it was prepared for more than a month in advance. It was originally scheduled to hold a party, government, and military symposium immediately after the conference, so in addition to the commissioners and county magistrates of Western Zhejiang, there were also party headquarters, anti-Japanese defense committees, and military leaders from various counties. Also, because the opening date of the conference was originally set for March 10th, most of the attendees arrived before the 10th. Those days were filled with continuous spring rain and muddy roads, which was really hard for the gentlemen who came to the meeting. Not only were they covered in mud, but the problem of accommodation could not be solved after they arrived. All the hotel rooms were full four days in advance. Later arrivals were so anxious that they could only ask the conference secretariat for help. As a result, some borrowed dormitories from schools, and students lent fifty quilts to keep warm. Everyone made do as students in the upper and lower bunk dormitories. The hard bunks and thin quilts were not a big deal for the first couple of days, but later when the weather turned cold, they couldn't sleep at night due to the cold. They still had to attend meetings during the day, but everyone was excited and full of hard work.</p>
<p>The convener of the conference, Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was unable to arrive on the originally scheduled opening day due to the long distance, so the 10th and 11th were changed to group reviews and preparatory meetings. The first group reviewed proposals related to civil affairs, finance, and construction; the second group reviewed military proposals; and the third group reviewed proposals related to mass organization and training, education, and culture. On the 12th, rumors spread that the chairman was about to arrive, and the welcoming staff gathered and set off at 10:20 AM. A sudden air raid alarm gave people a strong stimulus. As a result, the enemy plane did not come to participate in the welcome, but the chairman arrived from the rear in the middle of the day amidst everyone's anticipation. In the evening, the wartime staff training class and the Second Political Work Brigade directly under the Zhejiang Provincial Government held a grand recreational performance to welcome Chairman Huang and the attendees.</p>
<p>The official opening of the conference was on the 13th. On this day, an expanded memorial week and opening ceremony were held at 8:00 AM. All schools and institutions near the administrative office participated, and Chairman Huang personally delivered the opening speech, explaining the mission of the administrative office and the important tasks of the administrative conference. The main points can be summarized as follows: A, The mission of establishing the administrative office: (1) To be the front-line command organ for political offensives, (2) To be the pioneer in strengthening the political power in guerrilla war zones and implementing political offensives, (3) To strengthen various anti-Japanese war efforts in areas close to the occupied areas to ensure the safety of political offensives. B, The central topics of the administrative office meeting: Administrative aspects: (1) Adjusting the administrative structure to fully enrich the basic work of townships, towns, and baojia, (2) Mobilizing the masses should be based on the four major policies of management, education, support, and hygiene, and the people's congress should be the starting point for implementation, (3) Preventing traitors and strengthening the basic strength of the War of Resistance, (4) Reducing illegal exploitation in the occupied areas and reorganizing finances, (5) Facilitating communication and transportation between the front and rear.

D, Common expectations for the staff of the administrative office, attendees, and political workers: (1) Cultivating the spirit, life, action, and ability that a fighter on the front line should have, (2) Ensuring the practical cooperation between the party, government, and military to jointly resist the enemy, (3) Persevering and completing the sacred mission. Every word was cautionary, and he spoke for two or three hours.</p>
<p>On the 13th and 14th, the conference listened to reports from various units, and the weather was slightly clear. The atmosphere in the spring chill conference hall was lively and tense, giving people infinite excitement. The reports from various units were concise and detailed.</p>
<p>The formal discussion of the conference was supposed to be held on the 15th, but because the previous review of proposals was not completed, Chairman Huang instructed that the key points should be discussed and the review should continue. Thus, the 15th was spent in small group discussions again. In the evening, Chairman Huang hosted a dinner, and of course, everyone was very enthusiastic to attend. There was no wine on the table, and the dishes were not abundant, but the entire venue was filled with everyone's excited emotions. The attendees wore red and yellow symbols, which looked interesting and fluttering under the gas lamps. During the dinner, the host spoke, first repeatedly explaining the precious opportunity of this gathering, and then pointing out that what supported the national War of Resistance and national construction after the "September 18th Incident" was the "Lushan Spirit", and hoping to use the "Tianmu Spirit" to support the political offensive in the Southeast. Finally, he recited his own poem "Feeling of Westward Tour of Tianmu Mountain (Man Jiang Hong)". The meaning of the poem is: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Death of a Peasant Soldier</h3>
<p>— By Agnes Smedley, translated by Jiancun of the News Agency</p>
<p>This article was recently sent to Mrs. Situ Yongjue, Director of the Hong Kong Health Bureau, by Miss Agnes Smedley, who is full of justice. She asked the Western doctors living in comfort to temporarily put aside their happiness and rush to the front line to treat the countless wounded soldiers who are fighting for the country and the nation. ——Translator.</p>
<p>Today I saw the death of a Chinese peasant soldier. In China, there are more than a million soldiers who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered country and have dedicated themselves to justice. This peasant is one of them. This person's death is not of world importance. He did not leave unfinished work that others could not do. When he died, he did not have any last words or exhortations to the country, family, or friends. He just quietly closed his eyes. Even the wounded soldiers next to his bed hardly knew that he had died.</p>
<p>This man was about forty years old and was a voluntary soldier in the New Fourth Army. He was a farmer, and his body was very thin due to prolonged hunger. His face was dark, and two of his front teeth were missing. This was purchased by another wounded soldier. He and his comrade attacked the Japanese army's position together. They did not know they were injured at the time. Later, after the battle was over, they returned to headquarters and felt that they could not move. Both of them had a foot pierced by bamboo nails tied on the Japanese army's defense line.</p>
<p>This peasant soldier lay silently in bed and only said once that his surname was Hu and that he was a farmer. Every line on his face and body symbolized his pain. He seemed to be constantly thinking about something.</p>
<p>The doctor said at night, "He can't live anymore. He's too malnourished and has no resistance at all. It's too late to give him nourishment." At noon on the third day, he passed away peacefully.</p>
<p>He was about forty years old. The New Fourth Army rarely recruited old soldiers. People of this age have to support their families, and the army can recruit young people every year. Moreover, the New Fourth Army does not use conscription. They are all voluntary soldiers who voluntarily join the army. Therefore, it is certain that this person volunteered. Is he a farmer who has already lost his family and been destroyed? Has his village been leveled by the enemy? It must be.</p>
<p>The place where he fought has been abandoned and uninhabited by the enemy. According to people in the same team, he had only recently joined. He had obviously been hungry for a long time. His silence, his hard face, and the concern that radiated from his eyes all indicated that he had lived in suffering for a long time, which cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>I have continuously visited the hospital where this deceased soldier lived, and I have also mourned him and the graves of many other soldiers. I think it is easy for a person to embark on a journey with the farewell of family, friends, or a crowd of people cheering and applauding. It is also not difficult to go to justice with glory and light, knowing that the country will remember the merits in the future, and my death will be an example for the people of the country. But the death of this soldier surnamed Hu, like the deaths of millions of others like him, is dark. No one shed tears for them. Mourn for them. In the future free society of China, they will have no part—did they consider these things when they picked up their guns?</p>
<p>His death is ugly—but also beautiful—the Chinese people, their country has given them nothing but sorrow and hunger. But they can still dedicate their lives to the country.</p>
<p>Thousands die on the desolate battlefield, and thousands of wounded people stumble and stagger, staring at their wounds, looking towards the mountain roads or plains highways, hoping that someone will come to rescue them. Some who cannot support themselves fall under the leafless trees and rest forever. Those who are finally taken in and given some care are already very lucky!</p>
<p>Chinese Western doctors and foreign Western doctors—these people are dying for them, turning their lives into cultural struggles, can you sleep peacefully at night? Are you not disturbed by nightmares? Don't you blush with shame when you look in the mirror? If these people are defeated, are you not afraid for yourself and your descendants? You sit in the city, using your intelligence to make money. I want to ask you: Try to compare your lives with this nameless soldier surnamed Hu and millions of others like him—I am now appealing to you: Please put down your caresses temporarily and go to the front lines of China, where you can deal with various problems, various difficulties, and various heartbreaking matters, fight for justice, and take care of the strong men who die for your son and your country, and do not leave a shameful sign in history!</p>
<h3>Northeast Henan Counter-Offensive Proceeds Smoothly: Three Attacks on Kaifeng are Victorious; The Enemy Greatly Reinforces Kaifeng and Taiyuan; Our Army Takes the Initiative in the Hubei Battle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 22nd] Our army in eastern Henan launched a third attack on Kaifeng at 2:00 AM on the 20th. Although the enemy was heavily guarded, they were unable to stop our army's brave advance. After our fierce attack, they once broke into the city. The enemy's puppet organs and warehouses were all set ablaze by our army. On the same day, by dawn, our army, having achieved its goal of destruction, safely withdrew.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] The enemy commander in North China recently ordered the Pinghan and Zhengtai railways to suspend passenger transport for three weeks. During this period, they will transport batches of enemy puppet troops transferred from the three northeastern provinces to reinforce Kaifeng and Taiyuan, respectively. This proves that since our army began its counter-offensive in Henan and Shanxi, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, and they have had to transfer reinforcements from the northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] Starting on the 18th, the county magistrates of various counties in eastern Henan led local teams, in coordination with the guerrilla units, to simultaneously attack the enemy in Suixian, Qixian, Tongxu, Chenliu, Minquan, Kaocheng, and Lanfeng counties, and to destroy transportation. According to intelligence received from various counties here, fierce battles have broken out near various counties. Because the teams are familiar with the terrain, the counter-offensive is progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 21st] There are about a thousand enemies near Shiyi Town, northwest of Qixian in northern Henan. Our army launched an attack on the 17th, taking advantage of their lack of vigilance, and besieged them on all sides. After four or five hours of fierce fighting, more than two hundred enemies were killed. The remaining enemies could not hold on and fled towards the Xiaodian River (north of Jixian). We are now pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yicheng, 22nd] (1) In the Yingshan area, our attacking troops destroyed the Tianmen-Zaoshi highway on the morning of the 20th, and ambushed on both sides of the Ying River. More than 300 enemies passed through the river from Zaoshi in the evening. We launched a surprise attack and engaged the enemy in a fierce battle for two hours, killing two enemy officers and eleven soldiers, and capturing seven boxes of ammunition, more than two thousand cans, and many other military supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shashi, 21st] The enemy on the east bank of the Xiang River occasionally shells our positions and fires randomly with machine guns to prevent our attacks. Yuekou's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Tianmen for days, Tianmen's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Zaoshi, and Zaoshi's enemies have been secretly transporting supplies to Yingcheng, appearing to be retreating in general. According to a certain commander, we have the initiative in the Hubei battle, while the enemy is in a passive position. In the past week, the enemy's casualties in various battles have been over two thousand, and we have seized countless spoils of war. The enemy regards the Xiang River as the gate to Wuhan and is struggling to defend it. Recently, they have added nearly three thousand reinforcements along the river. In order to maintain the plan to fight the enemy decisively on the east bank of the Xiang River, we have also increased the number of elite troops to hold the line. There will be new progress soon.</p>
<h3>He Long's Wife Released from Prison: Shanghai Court Finds Communist Party Member Not Guilty</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondent) Xiong Youwu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xiang Shi (alias Wang Xiangshi), the wife of Eighth Route Army leader General He Long, and He's younger brother Gan Chen, (alias Wang Wenming), were arrested by the Shanghai French Concession Police in 1933 and prosecuted by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for endangering the Republic of China. In this case, all the defendants were originally sentenced. Xiong Youwu was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed to the Supreme Court because he did not accept the judgment. He Long's wife Xiang Shi was sentenced to five years in prison and has now been released after serving her sentence. However, He's younger brother Gan Chen died in prison due to illness. During the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, Xiong Fenglun handed in a document. Regarding Xiong's case of endangering the Republic of China, the Supreme Court later sent it back to the Third Branch of the Higher Court for a new trial. The Third Branch of the Higher Court followed the order and summoned him several times, but he did not appear and his whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, the court legally served a public notice on the 11th of this month, and the case was heard by Judge Wu Tingqi, the chief of the criminal court, accompanied by Judges Wang and Chen. Xiong did not appear. At that time, Judge Wu appointed a pro bono lawyer for the defendant Xiong Youwu and defended him based on the three reasons given by the Supreme Court for sending the case back. He then announced the conclusion of the trial. Because the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China has been revised, there are no provisions for punishing Xiong's behavior. Therefore, Judge Wu took his seat in the Third Court at about 2:00 PM on the 14th and announced the main text of the judgment, that Xiong Youwu was acquitted of the charge of endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Front Line, Rear Area, Home and Abroad, Unanimously Demand Severe Punishment for Wang Jingwei: Shanghai City News Employees Declare Condemnation of Wang; Central News Agency Stops Supplying News to South China Daily</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 22nd] The anti-Wang movement in various circles here is now in full swing. Newspapers and periodicals carry airmail letters and telegrams sent from home and abroad and from the front lines, unanimously requesting the government to severely punish Wang Jingwei and others, thoroughly eliminate compromising and enemy-collaborating elements, and demand the elimination of all pro-peace newspapers and publications that violate the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. The anti-Wang and anti-traitor movement has a feeling of being in full swing. Also, according to Yu Dian, the head office of the Central News Agency here has telegraphed the Hong Kong branch to stop supplying news to the Hong Kong traitorous newspaper, South China Daily. Also, according to the news, the 21st was the Shanghai Spiritual Mobilization Cultural Circle Propaganda Day. News employees from all over the city issued a joint declaration, denouncing the fallacies and reckless actions of traitors, and calling on citizens to block all activities of Wang and his party members.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, 21st] The 115 trade associations in Shanghai once submitted a telegram to the central government, the original text of which reads: All Shanghai businessmen have a firm and unwavering belief in the established national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and will never be tempted by their heretical sayings and false deeds. Because there are rumors that Wang and his party members have secretly come to Shanghai to prepare to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization, Shanghai businessmen have heard the news and hate them to the core. Therefore, they send a joint telegram to express their intentions and beg for your approval. Shanghai Four Yan Trade Association, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Association, Shanghai Department Store Trade Association and other 25 trade associations bow their heads.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Prices Plunge: The Enemy Puppet Regime is Extremely Panic-Stricken</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 22nd] The exchange rate of counterfeit currency issued by the "United Reserve Bank" suddenly plummeted, and the local Japanese puppet regime felt quite uneasy. Previously, the value of national currency was often around 108 yuan of counterfeit currency per 100 yuan. Since the 15th of this month, it suddenly rose, and on April 19th, it once rose to 122 yuan per 100 yuan. After that, it shrank slightly, but it is still around 117 yuan. There are two reasons for the sharp decline in the value of counterfeit currency: (1) The "Reserve Bank's" plan to sell foreign exchange at a fixed price of 14 pence failed, (2) All sectors need national currency, and those who want to buy foreign exchange from foreign banks must buy it with national currency.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Ma Bufang, Chairman of the Qinghai Mobilization Committee, recently telegraphed President Jiang of the General Association, reporting that Qinghai Province has followed the program and held a general mobilization meeting of people from all walks of life, and held official oaths for civil servants and citizens in the provincial capital, with more than 40,000 participants. The situation was extremely exciting. President Jiang immediately replied to Chairman Ma, hoping to promote it and encourage morale. Also, according to Luoyang Dian, more than a hundred enemies entrenched in Fule City, west of Taiyuan, were surrounded by our local people's team a few days ago. The team was angry at the enemy's cruelty and took the initiative to attack, so they were doubly brave. After a fierce battle, one-third of the enemy was killed and they fled to Taikang.</p>
<h3>China's Voroshilov: General Shide</h3>
<p>— By F. Stakhov of the Soviet News Agency (Special Feature of This Newspaper)</p>
<p>A tenant farmer was born in Ma'an Village, Yilong County, Sichuan Province in 1886.</p>
<p>Many years later, under the oppression of landlords, the tenant farmer's family was scattered due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>It was not until the tide of the anti-dictatorship revolution in China surged in 1907 that the tenant farmer had an opportunity to go to Yunnan and enter the military academy at that time, the Yunnan Military Academy.</p>
<p>Today, this tenant farmer is the famous commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, leading more than 100,000 strong soldiers in North China to block the advance of the Japanese invading army.</p>
<p>This person is Zhu De.</p>
<p>After the Great Revolution of 1927, the Communist Party of China was officially established, and Zhu De was one of the leading comrades of this party. At that time, he led his troops, and because of the superiority of the organization, they were like a "crane standing out from the flock" among the various armies in South China. But at that time, no one thought that there was a revolutionary organization in his troops, and it was led by their commander Zhu De himself.</p>
<p>According to the Communist Party's opinion, Zhu De once left his motherland. He spent several years studying foreign languages and military science in Europe. He could speak several languages fluently, including French, Russian, German, and English. And he devoted himself to studying the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.</p>
<p>Later, when he returned to his motherland, he once said to his comrades who were close to him: "Now I have learned new knowledge, and I will dedicate it all to our revolutionary cause."</p>
<p>At that time, China's Communist Party sent him to the South China region. Fan Shisheng, the famous Yunnan warlord at the time, immediately appointed him as his staff officer. Fan Shisheng was trying to rule South China, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and become the "master of the Southern Kingdom," with Zhu De as his leader in military command.</p>
<p>Zhu De seemed to agree to his plan, but he never abandoned his plan to organize and prepare for the first revolutionary ambition. Later, Zhu De finally led his elite troops and set off to Jiangxi. In April 1928, the first "historical meeting" between Zhu De and the heroic Mao Zedong was held—</p>
<p>Mao Zedong led his guerrilla team composed of miners and ordinary workers from Hunan, and hired peasants and poor peasants from Jiangxi to Jinggang, and peasant and worker guerrillas from surrounding provinces rushed like water!</p>
<p>These revolutionary soldiers began to fight for their beliefs with sticks, hoes, and bayonets. At this time, the famous Red Army Fourth Army was formed there. The Central Committee of the Communist Party appointed Zhu De as the commander-in-chief of this army, and Mao Zedong as the political commissar.</p>
<p>Since then, "Zhu Mao" has become a special term in all Chinese newspapers, but the troops under their leadership have never suffered a serious defeat.</p>
<p>When his troops rested during marches, Zhu De himself would sit among those tired soldiers and tell them about the history of the places they passed through and the general social conditions. During the march, he slept with the soldiers in the same camp or trench. In his spare time, he lectured his subordinates on strategy and tactics. They also discussed the experiences of the Soviet Russian revolution and civil war at any time. His heavy and loud voice was familiar to his subordinates and the Chinese revolutionary masses.</p>
<p>After a period of civil war history, today, Zhu De and his loyal companions are carrying out the great task of fighting for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the people behind the Japanese army in North China. The Red Army—that is, the current Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army—although they have suffered great casualties and losses in the cruel struggle of the past year and a half, there are still more than 100,000 fighters who are accustomed to fighting, and their ranks are growing and strengthening day by day!—It is the soundest army in the Chinese Anti-Japanese Army.</p>
<p>Zhu De is one of the true national heroes among the Chinese masses. Like Voroshilov's efforts for the Soviet revolution, he is known in the ranks as China's Voroshilov.</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Negotiations Making Satisfactory Progress; Britain and France Studying Soviet Proposals; US Approves Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] The international situation is tense on the surface but strained within. Diplomatic activities continue behind the scenes. The proposals submitted by Soviet Russia to Britain and France are currently under careful study. French Foreign Minister Bonnet reported to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today that Franco-Soviet negotiations are proceeding actively, and the government hopes to achieve satisfactory results in the shortest possible time. Franco-Turkish negotiations are proceeding simultaneously with Anglo-Turkish negotiations. Discussions on security issues have been satisfactory, which is a good omen. Complete agreement has been reached on the Sanjak of Alexandretta issue. There were previous concerns that Turkey might forcibly occupy the Sanjak, but Turkey has now assured France that no such action will occur.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 11th] According to reliable sources here, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov has notified the British side, suggesting that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union send representatives to hold negotiations to discuss taking concrete steps to assist victims of aggression. It is reported that Litvinov also pointed out that the representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should accurately determine the aid capabilities that each country can allocate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Correspondents stationed in Paris for the "Daily News" and the "Daily Express" both stated that the Soviet Union's proposals regarding an anti-aggression front mentioned the Far East issue. The "Daily News" correspondent in Paris stated, "The Soviet Union's proposal includes a system of mutual guarantees to resist aggression, not limited to Europe, but also extending to Asia." The "Daily Express" correspondent in Paris stated, "I understand that the Soviet Union's counter-proposal indicates that if the Soviet Union fulfills its obligations in Eastern Europe and is attacked by Japan, it will require assistance from other countries." Furthermore, the diplomatic correspondent for the "Times" expressed opinions on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations that were similar to the general views in London, but specifically pointed out, "The Soviet Union's proposal has far-reaching and constructive insights, and it makes a significant contribution to expanding the principle of jointly resisting aggression."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky arrived in Moscow yesterday afternoon and immediately reported to the government on the British position regarding the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Seeds visited Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov again yesterday. According to information from here, although neither side has announced the details of the Soviet-British talks, the talks are indeed progressing satisfactorily.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, diplomatic figures here stated that the Soviet government submitted a counter-proposal on the 18th of this month, the content of which is a beneficial basis for negotiations and can prove the country's sincerity in cooperation. The two sides are continuing negotiations, hoping to create a compromise between the British original proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal so that achievements can be made before the 28th of this month (the date of Hitler's speech).</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are paying close attention to reports of an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. They clearly approve of this move, but US-Soviet relations may not be strengthened. This is because the authorities here believe that the United States becoming particularly friendly with the Soviet Union will prompt Japan to strengthen its relations with Germany and Italy, and a conflict may increase in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>France Prepares for Wartime; Cabinet Approves Increased Military Spending; Will Formulate Laws to Limit Income Tax; Finance Minister Calls on People to Return to Work Tightly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The French cabinet held a meeting tonight that lasted for two and a half hours and passed the following resolutions: (1) Increase funding for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Colonial Departments; (2) Expedite the payment of various expenses, especially those related to national defense; (3) Regarding various issues of wartime organization and supply. The second category of resolutions includes cases of direct management of finances, such as preventing tax loopholes, limiting the profits obtained by various factories and commercial organizations from manufacturing national defense goods, and levying certain income taxes that are not yet stipulated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] A method of levying income tax totaling 170 million francs will be proposed at tonight's cabinet meeting. The meeting will decide to limit the profits obtained by factories and commercial organizations engaged in national defense affairs. The working hours of all public institutions and factories manufacturing national defense goods will also be stipulated by laws formulated at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech to the nation today, calling on the people to make greater sacrifices to cope with the new situation. Reynaud said, "We have recently realized the greatness of France's efforts for the international community. Without France, what could Britain do? What could even the great United States do? The policy of isolationism has come to an end. Today, peace can only be restored by restoring the balance of power among European powers." The government has temporarily decided to increase normal working hours to 45 hours per week. Those who work overtime will be compensated. The national defense laws passed today include measures to resolve the issue of arms dealer profits. The state will levy taxes of 58% to 100% on these profits.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 21st] Three French cruisers and five destroyers departed eastward from here today. Eight French ships are still stationed here.</p>
<h3>Improve Armaments; Roosevelt Asks Congress for Another $6 Million</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Roosevelt sent a letter to the Speaker of the House yesterday, requesting Congress to allocate $6 million for defense expenses, stating that the funds are intended to be used to improve naval equipment and add machinery. In addition, a squadron of US battleships has arrived at Guantanamo Bay (Cuba) from various South American ports. It is reported that they will stay there briefly before heading to the Pacific.</p>
<p>US Monetary System Law Extended for Two Years</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] The House of Representatives passed a bill today to extend the authorization for the President to devalue the dollar and the Treasury Department to consolidate the value of the fund (including the authorization to subsidize new silver (item)) for two years. The Republican Party had proposed an objection, which was ultimately rejected by a vote of 225 to 158, and the extension bill was passed.</p>
<h3>Britain Announces Reinforcement of African Rifle Brigade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dar es Salaam, 22nd] The Central Government has recently announced the reinforcement of the 6th Battalion of the Royal African Rifles, stationed at the important military stronghold of Tanga, to strengthen the defense of Tanganyika.</p>
<h3>Observers Predict Roosevelt May Run for Re-election</h3>
<p>[Washington, 21st] Observers say that based on recent developments, Roosevelt may have hopes of being re-elected for a third term in 1940: (1) After Mr. White gave a speech on the "Pan-American Governing Committee," it is generally believed that the situation in South America is critical, so it is necessary for Roosevelt to be re-elected to make full use of his experience. (2) Roosevelt's new policies have not yet been fully implemented. (3) The world situation is tense, and a major war may be inevitable. Roosevelt must remain in the White House to cope with it. Note: Roosevelt has been re-elected for two terms. According to American practice, no president has been re-elected for three terms. If the observer's view is realized, then President Roosevelt will create a new record in history.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Ministry Denies Talk of Franco-Italian Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] According to a report in London's "Standard Evening News," French Foreign Minister Bonnet has begun negotiations with Italy, which are proceeding satisfactorily. The French Foreign Ministry has denied this report.</p>
<h3>Germany Again Propagandizes that Poland is Anti-German, Saying Serious Consequences Have Occurred</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The German news agency has recently listed many new incidents of abuse of Germans in Poland, saying that according to reports from the Oliewitz area, the Polish Western League is fiercely anti-German, and serious consequences have now begun to occur. So far, the steps taken by the Polish authorities are inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Actively Threatening and Enticing Both Balkan Nations, Seeking to Undermine Balkan Entente; Italian and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Will Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 22nd] Sources well-informed here say that the German Foreign Ministry has been very active recently, and foreign ministers from three countries will arrive in Berlin one after another soon. The first will be Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković, who will stay in Berlin from the 25th to the 26th of this month. The second will be Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky, but the exact date of their arrival in Germany is not yet known. Finally, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also arrive in Berlin at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. According to reports in foreign newspapers, the German government has asked the countries listed in President Roosevelt's telegram whether they feel threatened by Germany. This report has not been confirmed or denied.</p>
<p>Bulgaria Demands High Price</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] According to political circles here, the Axis powers are currently exerting their pressure on Bulgaria. Turkey is currently working for the British and French groups, and the Balkan Little Entente is also trying its best to pull Bulgaria into the anti-aggression group. However, Germany and Italy will use the restoration of lost territories before the 1913 Balkan War and World War as bait to make Bulgaria join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Bulgaria is raising its price at this critical juncture, simultaneously contacting both sides to demand the highest price. If the benefits given to Bulgaria by Germany and Italy are realized, in other words, Romania must cede about 3,000 square miles in the south, Greece about 3,000 square miles in the east, and Yugoslavia about 1,000 square miles in the west for their return to Bulgaria. General observations in London believe that Bulgaria's desires are not great, so even if it is given less than the above, it will satisfy its demands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 21st] Well-informed sources here recently declared that Italy is currently working hard to establish close cooperative relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary. Whether or not this can succeed depends on whether Yugoslavia and Hungary can reconcile. Foreign Minister Ciano will go to the port of Venice tomorrow to hold talks with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, advising the country to join hands with Hungary. Hungary has agreed to give up its territorial demands on Yugoslavia after being persuaded by Italy, so the estrangement between Yugoslavia and Hungary has disappeared. If Italy can obtain close cooperation between Yugoslavia and Hungary, then the country's plan to organize an alliance in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula (including Bulgaria) will be easier to realize. In addition, it is also reported that the two foreign ministers must also discuss the two issues of Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and withdrawing from the League of Nations. In short, Foreign Minister Ciano is currently making every effort to persuade Yugoslavia to truly join the German and Italian groups. If this can be done, then the Danube Alliance under Italian leadership will not only have a great impact on Turkey, Greece, and Romania, but also fundamentally undermine the Balkan Entente.</p>
<p>Italian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers Hold Talks</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 21st] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will begin a two-day meeting in Venice tomorrow. This is undoubtedly further evidence of Italy's determination to support its political, strategic, and economic position. In addition to doing its utmost to make Yugoslavia deeply believe in its sincere assistance, Italy especially hopes that Yugoslavia's political disputes will not give other countries the opportunity to interfere and forcibly provide "protection." Regarding this point, Italy is concerned about more than just Britain and France. Strategically, Italy's greatest concern is the Adriatic Sea, and it has carefully considered the dispute between the Yugoslav capital and the Croatian people over the entire Dalmatian coast. As for economic matters, it is reported that Yugoslavia is very welcome that Italy can grant it trade loans. If a satisfactory agreement can be concluded, Yugoslavia will be able to obtain a free trade zone in the port of Trieste.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Yugoslav Capital, 21st] According to authoritative sources here, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister will go to Berlin on May 3. It is said that this trip is at the invitation of the German side. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to depart for Venice tonight to hold talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. At that time, they will discuss the existing treaties between the two countries and issues of common interest.</p>
<p>Italy Will Force Yugoslavia to Join the Axis</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 21st] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will participate in the Rome-Berlin meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice tomorrow afternoon, so Yugoslavia's adherence to the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Rome-Berlin Axis seems inevitable. Ciano carries Hungary's promise to Yugoslavia to sign a non-aggression pact, but it must be conditional on Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern group. According to reports from Budapest, Yugoslavia will accept this condition when the Italian and Yugoslav foreign ministers have completed their negotiations. If this matter is realized, then Yugoslavia will abandon its intermediate position between the democratic countries and the Axis powers and formally join the totalitarian group.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Mistaken for Submarine; Canadian Authorities Issue Clarification</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 22nd] Regarding the discovery of a submarine of unknown nationality in the sea off Halifax, Canada, it has now been verified that it was not a submarine, but a fishing boat. Prime Minister Mackenzie has reported the truth to the outside world yesterday. The authorities had previously dispatched warships to patrol near the port, but no traces of a submarine were found.</p>
<h3>Hitler Prepares to Respond to US Proposal; Poses Questions to Neighboring Small Countries for Answers; Attempts to Disrupt British and French Security Plans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Roosevelt said at a press conference today that he had discussed the military aircraft of various countries with Colonel Lindbergh yesterday. The President did not comment on Mussolini's speech, only saying that he had not yet received a reply from Mussolini or Hitler.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] According to reliable sources here yesterday, Hitler is now "collecting materials" to prepare to respond to Roosevelt's proposal in his congressional speech on April 28. Hitler is now compiling two questions and asking neighboring small countries of Germany to answer. The two questions are (1) Are you afraid that Germany will infringe upon your country's independence or security? (2) Have you requested assistance from the United States or President Roosevelt? It is reported that Hitler has received answers from several countries, some of which said that they are not afraid and have not asked anyone for assistance. Hitler will use these materials to present counter-evidence, proving that Roosevelt's proposal is superfluous. Hitler's move is extremely cunning and can even disrupt the British and French security chain plan, because Hitler can say to the small countries, "Since you are not afraid of Germany, there is no reason to join the British and French encirclement policy."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 22nd] German Ambassador Blow recently asked the foreign affairs authorities of this country, based on the telegram recently sent by US President Roosevelt, whether the country believes that its independence has been threatened by Germany. The reply stated that Belgium's neutral status will be automatically guaranteed by Britain, France, and Germany, and it does not believe that it is subject to any threat. Regarding this matter, the officialdom has not issued a public statement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to a report from the "Daily News" correspondent in The Hague, the Dutch government has already replied to Hitler's question about whether Germany's attitude makes the Netherlands feel threatened. The Dutch government refuses to publish the reply, but it is learned that its general meaning indicates that although the Netherlands has not suffered direct threats from Germany in the past month, if the current tense situation cannot be eased, it is feared that war will inevitably occur in the future.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Sends Telegram to Congratulate Hitler on His Birthday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] In a telegram celebrating Hitler's birthday, Mussolini said that the enemies of Germany and Italy will never be able to separate the unity of the Axis. "The Italian people participate in this axis with firm confidence and a spirit of friendship. This is also where the beliefs and revolutionary spirit of the two countries lie. The spirit of friendship between the two countries has been tested repeatedly without being damaged. One day, our enemies will realize that the paths taken by the Fascist and National Socialist parties are both based on justice and peace."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] According to the decree promulgated today, all sixth-level people aged 33 and above must receive short-term military training, with a training period of four months.</p>
<h3>Madrid German Parade; Italian Newspaper Reports Extension to End of Month</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 21st] General Franco's headquarters in Burgos issued a public statement saying that the official decision regarding the extension of the Madrid victory parade has not yet been made.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 21st] The "Italian Daily" correspondent in Burgos said that General Franco's Madrid victory parade will not be held before May 30, so the date has been extended by another fifteen days compared to the original date (May 15). The reasons are not detailed.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses Conscription Issue; Ministers of Supply and Transport Will Both Obtain Seats in Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to reliable sources, the issue of implementing mandatory conscription will be submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting to be held on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] Official news, British Transport Minister Leslie Burgin has been appointed as Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet. Once the newly established Ministry of Supply has completed the legislative process, he will be formally appointed as Minister of Supply. Former Treasury Secretary Wallace has been transferred to Minister of Transport. Both of them can obtain seats in the cabinet meeting. Wallace's vacancy will be filled by Minister of Mines Crookshank, and Crookshank's vacancy will be filled by Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department Lowther. The latter two have no seats in the cabinet meeting.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo's Speech: Stop Japanese Aggression; All Countries Should Unanimously Boycott Japanese Goods; Our Resistance Strength is Growing Stronger</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the Manchester Reform Association tonight that if Japan cuts off the supply of imports from all directions, it will not be able to continue to support the war for half a year. Therefore, if Western countries can unanimously boycott Japanese goods and not trade with them, the war can be ended. Japan's daring to make trouble in the Far East is actually caused by the connivance of the great powers. The hesitation and self-preservation of the great powers are Japan's only guarantee. Japan can be regarded as the world's largest liar, able to safely carry out its deception at a time when the world is in turmoil. China has been trying the policy of tolerance for more than six or seven years, and finally realized that this kind of enduring humiliation to seek survival is only enough to win the smile of tigers and wolves, and a policy of peace is suitable to increase the desire of aggressors. In the past twenty-one months, Japan's international status has dropped to a second-class country. On the contrary, China passed through difficulties in 1938, but this year, its position is stronger than before, whether in military, internal affairs, or diplomacy. Although China's coastal cities and towns have fallen, the authorities have formed a strong and self-sufficient country in the southwestern provinces.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>The Harvest of the National Christian University Conference</h3>
<p>The National Christian University Education Conference was held in Hong Kong from the 17th of this month. This newspaper respectfully extended its congratulations and offered some encouragement in an editorial on the 19th. The conference closed yesterday morning on the 22nd. Summarizing the results of the six-day conference, 33 resolutions were passed, all of which are important cases for adapting the direction of Christian education during our national crisis. Generally speaking, they have not failed the expectations of all parties and can indeed be regarded as a great success of the conference. We should pay our respects to all the attendees.</p>
<p>The basic spirit of the various cases passed by this conference is, first, to cultivate the personality of Christianity. We believe that the most important aspect of the personality of Christianity is the spirit of struggle to sacrifice for the sake of defending truth and justice and saving human morality. This spirit is no different from the spirit of struggle of our Chinese nation today to resolutely resist Japan for the liberation of China and the salvation of world peace. Therefore, we dare to expect that the Christian education community can cooperate in improving the self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-confidence of the people in the future, and cooperate in the promotion of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The second is that education must be free, which of course refers to education in the areas occupied by × people. We hope that the Christian education community must abide by this resolution in the future and carry out a tenacious struggle against × people, traitors, puppets, and all evil forces in × people-occupied areas and other special environments, in order to complete the principles of educational freedom and educational dignity, and to continue to maintain education and never stop the education business. The third is loyalty to the country. This should be loyalty to the central government, adhering to the national policy of unity, adhering to the war of resistance, and building a national platform, and loyalty to the concrete decision of the supreme leader "to make the Three Principles of the People of the revolution the highest principle of education in the future." We further hope that the Christian education community will faithfully abide by this decision to cooperate in promoting war resistance education, building a new China, opposing fascist aggressors, and defending world peace and human culture.</p>
<p>In addition, the conference also specially decided to establish a Rural Construction Committee to promote production and construction, which is an urgent need in our country's current war of resistance and national construction. We sincerely hope that the Christian education community will truly and sincerely do its best to help the government cultivate this kind of talent and promote the cause of production and construction.</p>
<p>We express great satisfaction with this conference. Therefore, we have to have sincere expectations for the national Christian education community, and at the same time, we hope that it will make greater contributions to the cause of war resistance education, to the relief of unemployed youth in various places, to the elimination of widespread illiteracy, and to the assistance of all youth salvation education propaganda movements. We know that the resolutions of the conference and the implementation of this kind of assistance are extremely difficult. In addition to sincerely hoping that every Christian educator will display the Christian spirit of saving the world and the confidence that struggle will succeed, we dare to assert that the public opinion circles of the whole country and even the whole world will be your loyal supporters!</p>
<h3>European Absence of War</h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>In recent days, news from Europe has been filled with the heavy scent of gunpowder: "436 warships concentrated in the Mediterranean," "German and Italian troops massing on the Franco-Spanish border," "The situation in Gibraltar is critical," "Germany and Italy will attack Southeastern Europe," "Italy plots to establish a Macedonian protectorate." All of this has brought the world back to the eve of 1914, as if the European situation has reached its final critical point, and the outbreak of war is imminent.</p>
<p>Fear and panic fill every corner of the world; people are restless and insecure. Yet, many people are also wondering: Has the European situation really reached the final critical point? Will war really break out at any moment? We are among those who doubt. We doubt, and then we consider and analyze. Through consideration and analysis, we arrive at our conclusion: war will not break out. At least, we dare to assert that in this year, 1939, there will be no war in Europe.</p>
<p>Below, we would like to provide our reasons.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>We do not deny some undeniable facts. Such as: German young men and women are popularly drinking and saying: "Germany is ours now; soon, the world will be ours." Hitler said: "Our desire for colonies must be fulfilled." Italian people shouting: "Give me back Tunisia, march on Paris." Mussolini also said: "Our unfulfilled wishes will eventually be avenged."</p>
<p>Similarly, we have not ignored the possible consequences that these facts will bring about. However, we must say that what these facts express seems to be only the naked exposure of Germany and Italy's ambitions, and cannot be regarded as confessions that the Axis powers will take drastic actions in the short term.</p>
<p>We generally know that the Axis powers are not very "fond" of war. Their policy of aggression is not through force, but through "bluff"; not real war, but "the threat of war." The standard method of "the threat of war" is to station troops on the border, exert extreme coercion, seize the opportunity, and issue an ultimatum with lightning speed, leaving the other party at a loss and forcing them to concede and submit. The application of this method has been seen repeatedly. Especially Hitler's methods are clever, always successful, and always effective.</p>
<p>Although the aggressive arrogance of Germany and Italy is already very prominent, we believe that their aggressive actions are not 100% certain. Because, at least, they have to wait, hesitate, assess the situation, and seize the opportunity each time they act. This, we can see from the past history of aggression by Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The cooperation between Germany and Italy is only four years old. In the autumn of 1935, Italy began its long-planned invasion of Abyssinia. Mussolini's luck was not very good. Under the resistance of the Abyssinian people, the opposition of Britain and France, and the sanctions of the League of Nations, Italy was miserably trapped in a situation of being attacked from all sides. At that time, the younger brother Hitler was still very weak and obviously could not help. But in the end, because of the lack of initiative and inconsistent steps of the democratic countries, Italy still annexed Abyssinia.</p>
<p>By March 1936, the Italian-Abyssinian war had reached its final stage, and when British and French diplomats were preparing to take a slight rest, Hitler seized the opportunity and launched his debut. He sent troops to the Rhineland and resolutely tore up the Locarno Treaty. Britain and France were caught off guard and suffered a silent loss, opening the door to great convenience for the future.</p>
<p>Soon, the Spanish Civil War broke out. Germany and Italy openly transferred troops and weapons, becoming the behind-the-scenes bosses of the Spanish war. Speaking of the Spanish affair, it was always a joint action of Germany and Italy, but in fact, it was Mussolini who was the mastermind. Unfortunately, Mussolini's luck was indeed not very good. The Spanish Civil War could not be resolved quickly and dragged on for thousands of days.</p>
<p>If we attribute the Spanish war to Mussolini, then in the early stage of the Spanish war, for almost more than a year, Hitler was very quiet. Of course, that was because Britain and France were giving Mussolini trouble because of the Spanish war.</p>
<p>By March 1938, Germany and Italy's position in Spain had been established, and Britain and France had become cold and indifferent because of their hesitation. Therefore, Hitler saw a good opportunity and did not want to give it up. On March 12, he took Austria into his hands in one day. Austria was originally a forbidden area for Germany and Italy. Mussolini had grievances he could not express, and Britain and France naturally kept silent. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Continuing to Strive Amid Hardship: The Closing of the All-China Christian University Conference; A Decision on Wartime Educational Policies; Thirty-Three Resolutions Passed to Adapt to National Crisis Needs; Upholding Educational Freedom and Serving the Nation to Build a New China</h3>
<p>The National Christian University Education Conference, which began on the 17th of this month in Hong Kong and lasted for six consecutive days, concluded yesterday morning. A total of thirty-three resolutions were passed, which can be summarized into three major areas. In the future, the Christian universities, which account for 10 to 13 percent of the total number of students in public and private universities across the country, will follow the established policies and strive to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance in order to build a new China. It has been learned that the presidents (Huaxi University was absent due to circumstances) and professors of twelve universities, including Yenching University, are scheduled to leave Hong Kong today after the closing of the conference. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended the conference, released the results of the conference to the reporter. According to Dr. Miao, the National Christian University Education Conference was originally scheduled to be held once a year. It has been held for the first time after the war of resistance since February of the 26th year of the Republic. This conference demonstrated the spirit of unity on the one hand, and on the other hand, it exchanged experiences gained during the war of resistance and opinions on current issues. The thirteen Christian universities currently have approximately 6,000 students, accounting for one-tenth of the total number of students in public and private universities across the country. The reason why the universities have been able to maintain themselves after the war of resistance is entirely due to the fact that the faculty and staff understand the greater good, reduce their salaries and endure hardship, and the huge special subsidies granted by friendly countries (approximately one million yuan last year). At this conference, which lasted for six consecutive days, thirty-three resolutions were passed, all of which are wartime Christian education policies adapted to the national crisis.</p>
<p>Wartime Educational Policies</p>
<p>The resolutions passed at this conference can be summarized into three main points: A. (1) Cultivating Christian character; (2) Education must be free; (3) Loyalty to the nation. We would rather make the greatest sacrifice; these three principles are extremely important. The reason why each university has relocated repeatedly is purely because education cannot be carried out in accordance with these principles. This is the first major point of the resolutions of this conference. B. Implementing Christian higher education to build a new China. We must be prepared in advance for the great mission we bear for the nation and the country during the war of resistance and after the end of the war. Therefore, we hope that each university that cannot implement the above principles and has to move elsewhere will study the entire problem of the location in order to contribute to the locality, to the country, and to the people. We must not be content with temporary ease, harbor a psychology of escape, and even more so, we must not hope to move back to the original school in the future. This is the second major point of the resolutions of this conference. C. Establishing a Rural Construction Committee to concentrate the efforts of the universities and implement cooperation to build rural China. In the past, the universities' contributions to rural areas were inconsistent in their steps and scattered in their efforts. Each school spent approximately one million yuan on agricultural sciences each year. In the future, in order to promote agriculture, increase production, and build rural areas, there must be a unified organization to coordinate all plans in order to be effective. Therefore, there is the organization of this committee. This is the third major point of the resolutions of this conference.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties and Serving Education Faithfully</p>
<p>Dr. Miao also stated that the Christian cause in our country is divided into three types: one is evangelism, the second is medicine, and the third is education. After our country's war of resistance, the first two tasks continue to be carried out to the greatest extent possible in the occupied areas, adapting to the needs of the times and engaging in relief work with the greatest effort. As for education, there are only two paths to follow: one is to suspend operations, and the other is to continue operations. I have already stated before that if education can be free and the lives of faculty, staff, and students can be guaranteed, we will continue to operate regardless of how difficult or how great the sacrifice may be. Under this principle, eleven of the thirteen Christian universities before the war of resistance have continued to operate. For example, Huazhong University initially moved from Wuchang to Guilin, then to Dali in Yunnan, and finally to Western Sichuan. Soochow University moved to Huzhou after ____, then to Hangxi in Anhui, and finally to the Shanghai Concession, so the losses were great, but it is still continuing in difficulties.</p>
<h3>British Military Authorities Strengthen the Defense of Hong Kong and Singapore; 100,000 Sandbags Shipped from England to Hong Kong; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Will Also Arrive Successively</h3>
<p>International events are becoming increasingly ominous, and all countries are busy building defensive fortifications to prepare for emergencies. According to Western news, the British military authorities have recently stepped up efforts to strengthen the defense of Hong Kong and Singapore. Each transport ship arriving in Hong Kong and Singapore has brought large quantities of military supplies and military equipment. The most recent shipments to Hong Kong and Singapore were large quantities of sandbags and helmets. No less than 100,000 sandbags have been shipped to Hong Kong, and they are still arriving successively. It is reported that a batch of military supplies will also arrive on the large cruiser arriving in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng and Others from Shanghai in Hong Kong Organize the "Shanghai Society" to Connect Emotions and Promote Thrift</h3>
<p>In view of the increasing number of people from Shanghai gathering in Hong Kong, and the lack of an organization in peacetime, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng and other prominent figures from Shanghai in Hong Kong have initiated the establishment of a "Shanghai Society" to connect emotions and promote the new lifestyle of frugality, inviting Shanghainese people in Hong Kong to participate. It is reported that the initiators have already recruited more than thirty people. Anyone who is from Shanghai and familiar with the initiators can participate. The society has a kitchen for banquets, but each table is limited to no more than ten Hong Kong dollars in order to comply with the purpose of frugality. It is reported that the society will soon be fully prepared and ready to be established.</p>
<h3>Under the Tense Situation in Eastern Guangdong, the Relationship between Hong Kong and Shantou is Greatly Affected; The Exchange of Goods between Hong Kong and Shantou Will Be Greatly Reduced and Will Come to a Standstill in the Short Term; Strengthening Domestic Production and Moving Shantou Factories Inland Rather Than to Hong Kong and Macao</h3>
<p>Since the shift in the situation in South China, the coastal line of Chaoshan in eastern Guangdong has invisibly become the main center for the exchange of goods between our country and abroad. Freight transport between Hong Kong and Shantou is frequent, and the relationship between the two is becoming increasingly close, which is not insignificant in benefiting Hong Kong's industry and commerce. Moreover, the continuous supply of grains and vegetables from Shantou to Hong Kong is especially helpful for the food supply of Hong Kong residents. How long ago was it that suddenly smoke and fire erupted in the counties of Zhongshun and Xintai, and the bandits eyeing eastern Guangdong were also ready to move, causing the situation in Chaoshan to suddenly become alarming. Our local military and political authorities, in order to implement the national policy of resistance against Japan, have issued orders requiring the people and property of Chaoshan to be evacuated and transferred inland within a limited time.</p>
<p>The Chaoshan Crisis Affects the Relationship between Hong Kong and Shantou</p>
<p>As a result of the evacuation of all the people from Shantou, the Hong Kong-Shantou relationship, which was developing rapidly, was greatly affected, and the agricultural, mineral, and local products of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces that were shipped from Shantou to Hong Kong have completely stopped. The supply of staple vegetables, peanuts, soybeans, sesame, potatoes, wheat, chickens, ducks, and livestock from the Chaoshan area to Hong Kong is decreasing day by day. The amount of the above-mentioned miscellaneous grains and vegetables brought by each ship arriving in Hong Kong from Shantou has decreased by about six or seven tenths compared to before. If the situation continues to be tense, these staple grains and vegetables will inevitably disappear completely, which will have a huge impact on the food supply of Hong Kong residents. As for the products of Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and the factories of overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong that are transported to the inland provinces via Chaoshan, they have also been greatly reduced. According to people in Hong Kong-Shantou businesses, each Hong Kong business is stopping orders because the Shantou merchants have completely evacuated. It is expected that the goods shipped from Hong Kong to Shantou will come to a complete standstill in the short term. At the same time, the thriving Hong Kong-Shantou shipping industry has also suffered a fatal blow and has suddenly declined.</p>
<p>Strengthening Production and Moving Shantou Factories Inland Rather Than to Hong Kong and Macao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hai Cheng Wheel of the Delitz Company on the Hong Kong-Shantou route arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou. There were only a dozen or so first, second, and third-class passengers, and the number of staple grains, vegetables, and livestock was also extremely small. According to the crew members of the ship, since the situation in eastern Guangdong became tense, all the elderly and weak residents in the city have moved inland before today (yesterday), and very few have evacuated to Hong Kong and Macao. As for the shops and factories, etc., in view of the importance of strengthening domestic production during the war of resistance, they have all moved to safe areas inland to engage in production and will never move to overseas locations such as Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>Building Fortresses and Preparing to Annihilate the Bandits</p>
<p>Hua Zhenzhong and other commanders of the Chaoshan Garrison Command have stepped up the construction of all defensive fortifications. Solid fortresses have been built around Shantou City and at the main transportation hubs within the city, and complete arrangements have been made along the coast to prepare as a basis for defense. The measures within the city are all designed to prepare for street fighting. Obstacles such as sandbags have been piled up in front of the doors of important buildings. What is even more, all the trained young men in Chaoshan have generously risen up and joined the defense forces, preparing to fight the bandits to the death. Although the situation in Chaoshan is extremely tense, the sea is still calm. Although the bandit ships are constantly coming and going, they have not taken any action. When the Hai Cheng Wheel left Shantou (on the 21st), there were no bandit ships outside the port of Shantou. It is expected that they have been patrolling the coast near Xiamen in Fujian.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Pays Attention to the Tragic Incident of Abusing Refugees; Additional Managers Appointed to Each Refugee Camp; Residence Times for Refugees Staying in Camps are Also Specified; Incidents Can Be Reported to the Management Authorities</h3>
<p>The incident of a pregnant woman being beaten to death in the Kam Tin Refugee Camp a few days ago caused a public outcry. The Hong Kong government authorities are also paying close attention to it. In order to prevent future occurrences, yesterday, additional managers were specially appointed to each refugee camp, and the rules and regulations for refugee camps and the regulations that refugees should abide by were re-promulgated. It was also stipulated that if an incident occurs in the camp, it can be reported to the highest management authority, and no disputes can be started in order to prevent disputes. All regulations were published in this morning's Hong Kong Government Gazette. It is briefly stated that the government refugee camps now have many appointed managers, and a timetable for refugees' daily life has been promulgated. The refugee camps include Yau Tong, King's Park, North Point, Kam Tin Cha Keng, Fanling, North and South Stations, and San Uk Ling. The new regulations designate the Director of Medical Services and the Commissioner of Police as the highest managers. In addition to the Kam Tin Camp, one manager is appointed to each camp. In the Kam Tin Camp, one "manager" and one "deputy manager" are appointed. In addition, refugees in the camp must hang their badges on their chests for identification, and spitting and smoking are prohibited. Residences and toilets must be kept clean, and the orders of the guards must be obeyed, regardless of whether the guards are soldiers or police. If a dispute occurs, the civilians may also file a complaint with the manager. The parties concerned must abide by the manager's final judgment and must not cause disputes on their own. Gambling and wasting water are strictly prohibited in the camp. Non-refugees may not move into the camp without the consent of the Director of Medical Services, the Commissioner of Police, and the camp manager.</p>
<h3>Automatic Nationality Registration for Chinese; Implementation Can Begin During the Day; A Commissioner Is Appointed by the Chinese Affairs Department to Be Responsible for Handling It</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities will implement automatic nationality registration for Chinese in the near future. Registration forms are being printed, and their format is no different from that used by the British Civil Registration recently. Chinese members of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council have agreed to be responsible for the distribution of registration forms. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs has specially appointed a commissioner to be in charge of this matter. All British Chinese or Chinese nationals who are willing to serve the United Kingdom in times of emergency may fill out the forms according to the regulations.</p>

<h3>Under the Monopoly of Firewood Merchants, Firewood Prices Soar; Only 40 Catties Can Be Obtained for Every Dollar</h3>
<p>Firewood merchants in Hong Kong have recently taken the opportunity to hoard and monopolize, resulting in a sudden increase in firewood prices in the past two days. Those who could buy 45 catties for every dollar before can now only get 40 catties, and the price once sold for 36 catties a few days ago. Judging from the current situation, it is still possible for it to continue to rise. The lives of ordinary lower-class residents are invisibly affected.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Student Relief Association's First National Service Corps: Pioneering and Sowing Seeds in Southern Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>A Glorious Page in the History of Hong Kong Youth and Students</p>
<p>Special Feature by This Newspaper</p>
<p>… Not Bowing Down Before Difficulties</p>
<p>"Hmph! They're just some young masters and young ladies from Hong Kong. I heard they can sing and dance, men and women together, turning the world upside down in this day and age!"</p>
<p>"Do you know? They're a group of refugees carrying a lot of foreign money. If they come to our village, we'll be doomed! Ruined!"</p>
<p>When the first corps of the Student Relief Association's National Service Corps set off from Hong Kong on December 27th last year to serve in Gaozhou, southern Guangdong, this was the kind of misunderstanding they encountered from our compatriots, a serious blow.</p>
<p>The backwardness of culture in the interior is an inevitable phenomenon. Not bowing down before difficulties is the progressive attitude of youth workers.</p>
<p>The entire corps consisted of twenty-six people (six of whom were women). The leader was the astute and capable Liu Tanfeng Guang-sheng. They worked under the leadership of General Zhang Yan, commander of the 12th District Guerrilla Force. Apart from a portion who stayed in Maoming city to work, the majority went to the countryside to establish a base for their work. They wore the same clothes as the villagers, helping the farmers with planting and other labor. The men approached the men, the women approached the women, and gradually their lives became integrated with the farmers. They set up a clinic, curing many cases of festering heads and feet. Everyone in the village knew to come to them when they were sick. Two deaf-mutes with throat problems had sought help from gods and Buddhas without improvement. Finally, they were cured by the corps.</p>
<p>"You are truly living Bodhisattvas!" The villagers' misconceptions about the service corps gradually changed.</p>
<p>… Farmers' Schools and Children's Literacy Classes</p>
<p>During the day, they helped the farmers with their farm work, and in the evenings, they set up farmers' schools in the ancestral halls to train the farmers. Their slogan was "Learn to read and write." The content included current affairs reports, wartime readers, and songs. Later, in response to the farmers' requests, they also taught them abacus arithmetic and how to write letters.</p>
<p>What about the rural children? During the day, they taught them collective games and told them patriotic stories, teaching them songs. The children's bad habit of gambling was also gradually eradicated. In the evenings, they opened children's literacy classes in the ancestral halls. In addition to literacy and songs, the main purpose was to teach the children how to do intelligence work when war broke out in the future. In this ancestral hall, adults were trained on one side, and children were trained on the other, with families of all ages coming to learn together. After class, they happily returned home together. The ancestral hall was a new school that didn't cost any money, a center for the national salvation movement. The friends in the service corps were the teachers of the farmers, as well as their brothers and sisters. How delightful this sounds!</p>
<p>……Unfolding Women's Work</p>
<p>As for the rural women, because feudal ideas were still very strong in the countryside and they were mainly doing kitchen work, mobilizing women did not achieve as good results as mobilizing farmers and encouraging children. However, the female corps members did not relax their efforts in individual visits and the dissemination of first aid knowledge. On March 8th, they also led the women into the city to participate in the March 8th Commemoration Rally, and a representative gave a speech on stage. This was an unprecedented miracle in Gaozhou. During the rally there was an air raid, and the venue was emptied, except for this group of "country girls" who remained solemnly still. Firstly, they had just arrived in the city and didn't know what to do. Secondly, the female instructor (a female member of the Student Relief Association Service Corps) told them to keep order, and they obeyed. The simple and honest nature of the country girls greatly facilitated "education."</p>
<p>……Bonfire Meetings and Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>The annual "New Year Example" was the most joyous occasion for the villagers. The Student Relief Association Service Corps followed the old tradition and held a village-wide party once a week, lighting bonfires in the countryside. Every farmer happily brought two pieces of firewood to participate.</p>
<p>Once, on a moonlit night, they organized more than fifty capable farmers to practice guerrilla tactics on a high mountain, dividing them into two teams to compete for a flag on the mountain peak. They feigned attacks in the east while striking in the west, performing with great seriousness and speed. Every farmer knew that protecting their hometown was protecting their country, and they were very excited to request more instruction in guerrilla tactics, wanting to practice once a week.</p>
<p>……Destroying Roads</p>
<p>The villagers were still hesitant to destroy the roads. After the service corps persuaded them and personally started wielding hoes, the farmers followed suit.</p>
<p>They helped the farmers with their farm work, treated their illnesses, taught them to read and write, and led them in many interesting activities. The farmers not only completely overcame their past misconceptions, but also sincerely admired them. The gentlemen in the village said, "If you stay here for another two years, our village will be so much better!" Because the propaganda teams and work teams of the past were very impractical and could not integrate with the farmers.</p>
<p>……Spiritual Comfort, Priceless Reward</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, every household competed to invite them to their homes to celebrate the New Year and drink wine. If there was any celebration such as "paying homage to the gods," "hanging lanterns," etc., they were sure to invite them as honored guests.</p>
<p>In addition to often sending many sweet potatoes, vegetables, cakes, etc. to the group, the farmers also secretly sent some to the individuals they were particularly close to and particularly fond of. If they politely declined, the farmers would think that they were "not giving them face" and would be very unhappy.</p>
<p>They initially lived in the low, damp basement of the ancestral hall, their bodies covered in spots from mosquito attacks. Later, the farmers were so moved by their work that they apologized, saying, "You have traveled thousands of miles to come here for our sake, we are truly too sorry for you!" Then they collected a lot of planks and mosquito nets to provide for them.</p>
<p>When several female students were ordered to transfer to work elsewhere, many villagers cried. When Mr. Yuan left the village due to an incident, many farmers surrounded him and asked, "Have we offended you in any way?"……</p>
<p>This kind of spiritual comfort, a reward that money cannot buy, is something that the young masters from Hong Kong could never have dreamed of.</p>
<p>……A Great Mission</p>
<p>In accordance with the wartime organization regulations of the Commissioner's Office, the farmers' school in the village will be changed to a self-defense work team. The children's literacy class will also be changed to a children's singing team. This is the glorious history of Hong Kong students returning to the motherland to pioneer and sow seeds. They plan to make this central village even better, so that it can serve as a model and be extended to other villages.</p>
<p>As for the work in the city, it is also being done very well. When the authorities train new cadres for the self-defense teams in various villages, they are assigned to take charge of political work. The Dianbai County government also retained three of their comrades to help there. Under the sacred mission of defending southern Guangdong and consolidating the southwest, the Student Relief Association Service Corps is a brave and hard-fighting vanguard.</p>
<p>The corps members are progressive students, teachers, and staff from Hong Kong. Currently, the Student Relief Association only gives them six dollars a month, which includes food, shoe money, pocket money, everything. This time, the corps specially sent representatives Yuan Hong and Huang Sha to Hong Kong to raise about two thousand dollars for the corps' second six-month living expenses, and to replenish medicines and personnel. General Zhang Yan also sent a letter to the Student Relief Association and various organizations, expressing his gratitude to the service corps and asking for continued assistance with manpower and resources. When the reporter listened to Mr. Yuan's report yesterday, I was truly filled with endless emotion. I believe that patriotic overseas Chinese and organizations will be happy to extend a warm hand to the hardworking youth and the Southern Guangdong authorities who are responsible for the great mission of national defense, providing them with practical assistance!</p>

<h3>The Creation of Scripts</h3>
<p>— Xia Yan</p>
<p>——Lecture Manuscript for the "Hong Kong Youth Drama Association," recorded by Zhu Baishui</p>
<p>A problem that is commonly felt in the current drama circle is the "script shortage." How should this problem be solved? Let's talk about the creation of scripts.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the existing playwrights in China are writing too little. Although there are many young playwrights, the programs on stage are still very poor and in urgent need of remedy.</p>
<p>I feel that in the past we seemed to place too much responsibility for the drama movement on the playwrights, thinking that only scripts written by famous playwrights can attract audiences and please audiences; that we must only stage good scripts; and that everything else, such as directing and acting, is of secondary, tertiary, or even negligible importance.</p>
<p>However, I believe that this way, there will never be new directors and good actors, and at the same time, it hinders the growth of new playwrights.</p>
<p>Taking new playwrights as an example, if they painstakingly create a script, even if it originally had the value of being staged, it will forever lose the opportunity to be staged because they are not famous enough or not "exciting and intense" enough, and they will become very discouraged.</p>
<p>At the same time, because many people want to describe the "plot" of the script as tense and pleasing to the audience, they vigorously encourage young playwrights to empty-headedly fantasize about tense and lively stories, and to construct unrealistic legends in a hollow manner. As a result, it is very tense, very interesting, but also very formulaic!</p>
<p>Young people who seriously write real scripts never have the opportunity to be staged. And only farces can exist in the "market." With scripts of farces, directors and actors become unimportant.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should allow new young playwrights to create as much as possible. As long as their consciousness is correct and the story is true, the shortcomings in the script's technique should be supplemented by the performers.</p>
<p>Originally, a large part of the responsibility for the art of drama lies on the directors, actors, and stage designers, etc.; but in China today, the requirements for the script are eighty percent, or even ninety percent. As a result, actors and directors have no opportunity to develop, no opportunity to study and learn with their hearts.</p>
<p>As a result, every performance imitates others in the same way, and just gets on stage. This is not the way to go.</p>
<p>So, how should we create scripts?</p>
<p>First of all, the attitude of everyone preparing to write must be sincere and diligent. Don't fantasize, but create a typical character from many complex and intricate phenomena, and seek a good theme from a wide range of trivial subjects.</p>
<p>For example, in the War of Resistance, how should we praise the light, how should we expose the darkness, how should we observe the materials we need, how should we criticize the impact of a certain event……</p>
<p>If you write with such sincerity and passion, you will definitely have good achievements. Even if it is not very successful, it will definitely not be a complete failure.</p>
<p>Now, we want to give the scripts of new playwrights more opportunities to be staged.</p>
<p>Every young playwright must write about what they hear and know, write about the subjects they understand very well. Because only in this way will the created works not fall into conceptualization and formulaism.</p>
<p>I think it is very difficult for people who live a very wealthy life to describe the life of poor people; for people who have not been to the battlefield and have not been in contact with the war, if they write about guerrillas and describe volunteers, I think they will definitely fall into fantasy, into inaccuracy, and into concepts.</p>
<p>But does this mean that people who lack life experience cannot write?</p>
<p>That's not necessarily the case. We can put in effort to refer to, study, and seek from books, newspapers, and conversations; conduct very in-depth observations and understand from relevant aspects, and only start writing after we fully and thoroughly understand all the subjects we need. That's always better than writing randomly.</p>
<p>In the use of script writing techniques, there is no need to imitate others. Try to create new forms as much as possible. There is no need to use tense scenes to attract the audience, nor is there a need to please the audience with jokes.</p>
<p>Young playwrights should have confidence and write more realistic and moving scripts. Don't imitate your predecessors, the next generation should surpass the previous generation!</p>
<p>In summary, solving the script shortage does not necessarily mean hoping that famous playwrights will write. We should try our best to discover new young playwrights. At the same time, our young directors, young actors, and all other workers must bravely perform difficult scripts.</p>
<p>——Only performing a difficult script well is the honor of the performers and actors, what's so great about performing a famous farce well?</p>
<p>It should be a more in-depth stage! We need to put in more effort and hone ourselves further! Therefore, the new drama of the new era must be created by young friends.</p>
<p>One Scene from the Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues</p>
<p>Captured × Military Prisoners During the Victory at De'an</p>
<p>After Consoling Them, They All Oppose the × Military Clique's Act of Aggression</p>
<h3>A Sincere Recommendation for "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" and Other Epics Written in Blood by Thousands of National Heroes</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>The "Wartime Special Issue," a wartime documentary film produced by the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and produced by the China Film Studio, with the first to fifth collections compiled by Mr. Luo Jingyu, has already been shown in Hong Kong; the achievements of these dozen or so photographers who were born into and out of the battlefield, experiencing hardships and dangers, do not know how many hot tears have been shed under the screen by Chinese sons and daughters living in Hong Kong who miss the War of Resistance against Japan! Recently, the "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" has been compiled by Luo Jingyu and Yuan Congmei, and has been transported to Hong Kong, and will soon be shown in the Central Theater.</p>
<p>At a secret screening, the reporter had the opportunity to see this systematic history of the War of Resistance for the past three or more months. When I was watching this film, I felt both glorious and ashamed! The development of the motherland, the high tide of anti-Japanese sentiment, the heroic and brave Chinese army, and many touching deeds made people's blood boil, and they couldn't help but shed tears. It is enough to make people feel proud, but also to feel that they are living in comfort in Hong Kong and cannot join the embrace of the motherland and do their part for the War of Resistance. They feel ashamed of themselves and cannot help but feel a "thorn in their side."</p>
<p>The value of "Wartime Special Issue" lies not only in its precious news—news that has not been recorded in newspapers, news that has never been seen or heard before—but mainly in the fact that it can systematically explain the general trend of the War of Resistance with these news, and add explanations with charts, so that people can clearly see the inevitable victory of China and the self-destruction of the × people.</p>
<p>The sixth collection includes the victory at De'an, a final glimpse of the evacuation of Guangzhou and Wuhan—not only did the citizens evacuate in an orderly manner, but Wuhan also had a service corps organized by students who had spent their lives studying in Japan, which plastered anti-Japanese propaganda slogans written in Japanese everywhere, preparing to show them to the × troops who were about to invade the city, so that they would receive some shocking stimuli after exchanging a huge price for an empty city. The Nanyue Conference convened by Chairman Chiang, which decided on the second phase of the War of Resistance, gathered more than two hundred generals participating in the War of Resistance, and used the experience gained with blood to discuss the initial combat plan, which also made the audience feel particularly excited.</p>
<p>There is also the scene of the × aircraft frantically bombing Guilin at the time, taken by a specially invited Russian war photographer, Karlman. In addition, the photographer specially sent by the factory infiltrated the × army's encirclement and took pictures of the daily life of Lushan Guiling, raising the flag on the top of the mountain, and the various situations of using guerrilla warfare to attack the × people. In addition, the front-line generals of the east, west, south, and north battlefields, such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Tang Enbo, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, and Shang Zhen, also met the audience on the screen one by one: and the front-line battle scenes were all taken by the photographer at the risk of his life, giving the audience the feeling of being on the battlefield.</p>
<p>What is especially noteworthy is the lives of the prisoners. From their natural actions, one can see the pain in their hearts. After losing their combat effectiveness, we not only treat them well, but also sympathize with these weak people driven by the military. We hope that they will gain new awareness.</p>
<p>Along with the premiere of "Sixth Collection of Special Wartime Issues" will be "Movie News" No. 48, which chronicles the grand occasion of the gold offering during the Chongqing Festival. And the anti-Japanese song collection cartoon short film "Collecting Winter Clothes," which uses a cartoon-style technique to apply China's relatively backward cartoon production skills in a very good way. Because the songs have substantial content, they feel even more pleasant to listen to, and it is also worth watching.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should mention the photographers who participated in the production of the "Wartime Special Issue." They bravely carried cameras and ran back and forth in front and behind the front lines. The task of carrying a camera to fight is more important than a soldier carrying a gun to fight, but they take the same risks. These photographers are Luo Jizhi, Han Zhongliang, Liu Mingxuan, Yao Shiquan, Chen Chen, Wang Zhongxi, Li Yin, He Luying, Zhu Shuhong, Xu Zhiguang, Xu Qishan, and Wang Zhigang. We pay tribute to them here, hoping that they will achieve better results and that we can see them in the next collection.</p>

<h3>"Huanghuagang" in Full Swing</h3>
<p>— Xiu Fu</p>
<p>"Huanghuagang general rehearsal tonight," "Huanghuagang general rehearsal tonight"……</p>
<p>On the 20th, the Hong Kong news columns of every newspaper prominently published this eye-catching headline.</p>
<p>On that night, a night after the rain, with a gentle spring breeze, in the dark auditorium of South China Middle School, countless people were flashing, crowding, laughing... all those present were drama workers from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Actors from the Xinsheng Drama Society, Hongbai Drama Troupe, Zhongyi Drama Troupe, Lufeng Drama Society, Cyclone Drama Society, Dingchou Drama Society, Youth Troupe, Zhonglu Drama Troupe, Ziqiang Drama Society, Rendou Drama Troupe, Tieliu Drama Troupe, Qingniantongle Society, Ant Drama Troupe, Vanguard Drama Troupe, Time Drama Troupe, Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, etc. all arrived.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqing, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi, Tang Shuming, and other drama seniors also arrived. Since the start of the "Huanghuagang" project, all the staff have gathered together the most fully this evening. Such a gathering under a great call and unified solidarity is so inspiring!</p>
<p>Due to the repeated postponement of the performance, everyone has invisibly developed a tendency to slack off, which is naturally not good. However, the sincere and enthusiastic meeting of all the staff that evening proved that everyone's slackness can be quickly overcome.</p>
<p>As the time is getting closer and closer to the performance, it is urgent to strengthen our work and quickly complete this great task in a blitzkrieg manner. At the same time, in order to increase the effectiveness of the work, a new and careful plan has been started for the rehearsal time and the distribution of director responsibilities.</p>
<p>The rehearsal time is almost every day from the 20th onwards. The new distribution of directors is decided as follows: Prologue Hu Chunshui, Act 1 Huang Ninglin, Act 2 Ouyang Yuqian, Act 3 Zhong Qinan and Lu Dun, Act 4 Ouyang Yuqian and Li Jingbo, Epilogue Tan Guochi.</p>
<p>Obviously, the director's responsibilities have been strengthened. Mr. Huang Ninglin, Zhong Qinan, and Tan Guochi are all senior figures in the Guangzhou drama circle and participated in the important work of the "Huanghuagang" performance in Guangzhou last year. This time, they are re-participating in the Hong Kong performance with a familiar attitude, which will undoubtedly provide great help!</p>
<p>In recent days, rehearsals have been taking place every night in Zhongyi and South China Middle School, tensely and actively. Every worker is struggling under the banner of this great and vast undertaking with the greatest effort and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In addition to the important requirement for the number of actors in this national revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang," its difficult stage design and costumes and props are equally important, especially the troublesome set design, which is of absolute importance. In the past, when it was performed in Guangzhou, what made the entire process of "Huanghuagang" the most glorious page was the mobilization of countless stage workers to complete its installation with extremely strong power. What people will never forget is a group of little heroes and our "Old Huo" - 尔. In Hong Kong, this difficult task was originally placed on the shoulders of Old Er, but unfortunately, he fell ill last month. It was then handed over to a very capable Mr. Ye Jian, but Mr. Cai Chusheng's "Orphan Island Paradise" grabbed him, and as a result, the director of the Hongbai Drama Troupe, Mr. Lu Jingguang, was finally pulled out to shoulder this thankless task.</p>
<p>It is a fact that time is very tight. It is not easy to build four or five huge sets in about ten days, but Mr. Lu Jingguang sincerely and bravely took on this responsibility. In recent days, he has been hurriedly and tensely directing the start of the task.</p>
<p>In addition, the costume design and preparation have begun under the responsibility of Mr. Tang Shuming Tang Xingtuan, and the props have been designed and prepared under the responsibility of Mr. Zhong Pinglin Jin.</p>
<p>The publicity is also starting to be very planned. It is believed that at the joint meeting on the 19th, Mr. Lu Fu had offered very detailed good suggestions, and preparations have been underway in recent days. It is planned to publish more than 20 special publications in various newspapers during the performance period, so it is very urgent. It is hoped that the various drama troupes will send more manuscripts related to "Huanghuagang" to the publicity department. At the same time, many very exquisite art advertisements, etc. will be printed and sent out in the future, and it is hoped that this vast publicity campaign will receive satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Here we can imagine how the entire work of "Huanghuagang" is unfolding in a tense and rapid manner. May this great joint performance push the Hong Kong drama movement to a newer stage and unite Hong Kong drama workers into a stronger front!</p>
<h3>After the Wuhan Chorus Went Abroad, They Strengthened the Drama Group. Xiang Kun Returned to Hong Kong to Recruit New Talents</h3>
<p>The Wuhan Chorus is not only a "chorus," but drama is also an important tool for them to engage in the national salvation movement and expand international propaganda. Since the group left Hong Kong for Singapore, they have given public performances for more than four months, raising a total of 300,000 yuan in national currency. In more than one hundred public performances, they all appeared in the form of a combination of "chorus" and "drama," which greatly inspired the overseas Chinese. The group is now continuing its propaganda and fundraising work in Johor. In order to strengthen the drama lineup, Xiang Kun, the head of the group's drama section, specially came to Hong Kong to recruit new drama talents. According to Mr. Xiang, without publishing an advertisement, dozens of people have applied for the exam in just a few days. The exam will be held today, with sincerity towards national salvation drama as the most important criterion. It is planned to recruit two women and one man. After obtaining their passports at the end of this month, they will travel south with Mr. Xiang to return to the team in order to continue to expand their work. Mr. Xiang's conversation with the reporter was very exciting. The reporter has written an article "The Wuhan Chorus in Singapore," but due to the crowding of manuscripts in this issue, it will be published in the next issue.</p>

<h3>Church Student Singing and Drama Competition Held Last Night, Pui To Wins Championship</h3>
<p>The Christian Student Union of Hong Kong, in order to cultivate students' artistic talents and to provide relief to refugee students and children, held a singing and drama competition assembly at the St. Stephen's Girls' College auditorium yesterday, the 22nd, at 7 p.m. The content was divided into two groups: singing and drama. Participating in the drama group were Lingnan Affiliated Secondary School, Pui To Girls' Middle School Youth Association, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union's "Jin Guo Hua Guang Troupe," among others. The group specially invited Mr. Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others to serve as judges. As a result, the championship was won by the Pui To Girls' Middle School Youth Association, with the drama "Redemption" adapted from 衍之. There were two runners-up, one being Lingnan Affiliated Secondary School's "The Moon Rises," and the other being the Women's Christian Temperance Union's "Jin Guo Hua Guang Troupe's" "Blood Soul." The performances were all very successful.</p>
<p>Children's Drama Association General Meeting to be Held Today at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Children's Drama Association is the highest unified organization of children's drama groups in Hong Kong. Since the active preparations by the Ant, Vanguard, Qiang Zhong, Central, Student Relief, Youth Together, and other children's drama groups, all work has been very vigorous. It is heard that a general meeting of all members will be held today at 1 p.m. at the Chinese Children's College to determine all work progress and to continue to invite non-participating children's groups to join. This is a new opportunity for the children's movement and drama movement in Hong Kong. We sincerely wish it a healthy growth.</p>
<p>True Light Girls' Middle School Drama Troupe Performs at the YMCA the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The various grade drama troupes of True Light Girls' Middle School regularly take turns performing at the YMCA every week. On the one hand, to expand salvation and national salvation propaganda, and on the other hand, to promote the popularization of drama, the intentions are beautiful and good. The performances have been very successful and have been praised by people from all walks of life. The day before yesterday (the 21st), the third-grade junior high school students of the school once again performed three one-act plays at the YMCA auditorium, namely "I Am Chinese," "An Enemy of the People," and "Scar," as well as the Victory Hymn, which greatly moved the audience.</p>
<h3>Performances Once Every Seven Revolutions</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>It has been twenty months since we left Shanghai. With the progress of the entire war of resistance, drama has achieved amazing results during this period. It has penetrated among the masses, and it is loved by the vast number of peasants and soldiers. Everywhere, in remote rural areas, and on the front lines, we see groups of drama workers, wearing old clothes, barefoot, carrying simple props, setting up their camps everywhere—fields, mountain peaks, densely wooded places, trenches... performing enthusiastically.</p>
<p>What should be especially mentioned here is that these new drama outposts are all middle school students and young intellectuals. They bravely opened up a bright road, a constructive and growing road, for the emerging drama of the new China. The entire future of drama is entrusted to them.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that there are very few people who have always been engaged in drama work who are participating.</p>
<p>In this great torrent, we work with these pure and enthusiastic friends, and we have learned a lot from them, especially a new spirit, a courage to move towards the truth without fear of difficulties and hardships. Here, I deeply miss a group in Dabie Mountain. They returned to their hometown, Shangcheng, from Qingdao, Beiping, and other places, completely abandoning all their original lives and throwing themselves into the ranks of the peasants; more than a hundred of them were excellent middle school and university students, and the women participated in various work just like the men. For example, writing letters of condolence, they mobilized the people of the whole county to participate enthusiastically in one morning. They patiently, driven by enthusiasm, overcame all stubborn and terrible difficulties. Cleaners, odd-job men, all kinds of chores; what the common people did, they did. Now, they are in the Dabie Mountain, working with the guerrillas! When we left the mountain peak of Xinjian'ao, they wrote a small flag and gave it to us, accompanied us for more than ten miles. The Japanese ×× artillery fire was clearly resounding in our ears. We parted in the small town of Xindian. They squeezed together and shouted: "Don't forget us!" We turned our heads to look at them, standing on the earthen slope waving their hands, a group of black-faced, ragged people, an infinite sense of parting and joy welled up in our hearts! They, they are the most outstanding and bravest sons and daughters of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Since we set off to this day, we have performed 741 times, with rural performances accounting for two-fourths, the remaining one-fourth being small cities and counties, and then large cities; we have traveled through eight provinces and contacted various different audiences: now I want to pick out a few practical examples of our work experience and the difficulties we have encountered in our work (in terms of performance), and write a little bit about them, which I think friends would also like to know.

<h3>The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>In wartime fiscal policy, monetary policy, in the era when currency management was not implemented, involved changing coins, reducing the value of currency to increase financial resources. In the modern era where currency management is implemented, currency inflation is carried out for utilization. However, China did not embark on the path of currency inflation, but rather increased tax revenue and issued public bonds to coordinate their utilization, as the primary strategy of wartime finance. The collection of gold and silver policies was carried out to increase the strength of wartime finance. It was previously reported in this newspaper that the Ministry of Finance issued a telegram on the 21st prohibiting silver merchants from privately purchasing gold and silver, and established a collection method, which can be said to indicate that the implementation of the collection of gold and silver policy has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Because silver was nationalized on November 3, 1935, the collection of gold was still the most vigorously pursued aspect of wartime gold and silver policy. The main methods were: the "Measures for Converting Gold into Legal Tender" and its implementing rules, promulgated on October 10, 1937, stipulated that those who exchanged raw gold, gold utensils, gold coins, or newly produced gold nuggets, gold sand, etc. for legal tender would be given a handling fee of 3% to 5%, those who purchased national salvation public bonds would be given an additional 6%, and those who made legal tender deposits would be given weekly interest at the newly set interest rate of two percent. Secondly, the "Measures for Supervising Silver Merchants' Collection and Exchange of Gold" promulgated on November 1, 1938, stipulated that silver shops were only allowed to collect or sell gold and 90% pure gold in the form of jewelry or utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaf, placer gold, and ore gold were not allowed to be collected or sold. As for shops that specialize in buying placer gold and ore gold, they should contact the Central Bank to sign a entrusted contract and transfer all of it to the Central Bank. In mid-November of the same year, the private transport of gold and any form of gold jewelry out of the country or to occupied areas was further restricted. The auxiliary methods were: the method of raising national salvation public bonds stipulated that national currency, hard currency, foreign currency, raw gold and silver, etc., and the gold public bonds stipulated that raw gold or gold coins, etc. could be used to purchase public bonds.</p>
<p>It can be said that the above main and auxiliary methods for the collection of gold and silver are very detailed. However, when China implemented the legal tender policy, the method of issuing legal tender to issuing banks with 60% legal tender and 40% guarantee was not abolished. Therefore, in the progress of the wartime gold and silver collection policy, there were inevitably defects—although the main methods had clear regulations on collection and transportation, there was no consideration given to the point of using the collection as a preparation for receiving coupons. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed financial institutions, stipulating that silver merchants in various places who had concluded coupon-receiving contracts with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank to collect gold and silver as reserves should first report to the issuing bank that they had contacted to receive coupons, and report to the Gold and Silver Exchange Office for entrusted handling, in order to eliminate the malpractices of speculation or smuggling. If a coupon-receiving contract had not been concluded and no application for entrustment had been made, it would be treated as private purchase for profit, and would be punished according to the circumstances. This method involves two agencies, the issuing bank and the Gold and Silver Exchange Office, and it is of course not easy for malpractices to occur, so it is easy to prevent or eliminate speculation or smuggling.

<h3>First Division Football Championship Battle, South China South Wins Championship, Fighting in the Rain, A Big Victory Over Navy Four to Zero, South China's Victory is the Success of Using Avoidance and Light Strategy</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Although yesterday was not torrential rain, it was very heavy. General football fans, witnessing this dull weather, were not happy, complaining that the heavens were not beautiful, and were afraid that the First Division League championship battle would be postponed because of this. If not, the players competing in the rain would at least reduce the wonderful performance.</p>
<p>There were also many people who worried about South China South, because although each of the South China players' football skills are highly skilled, their physical strength is not as good as that of Westerners, which is an undeniable fact. Moreover, people in the Navy are accustomed to life on the water, so it is reasonably thought that they are also conducive to water battles for football, so in this environment, they are afraid that South China will be more bad than good. In addition, the Navy's lineup is extremely complete, with strong personnel and horses, which seems to be rare this year.</p>
<p>The more people worried about South China South, the more they wanted to know the truth, so more than five or six thousand people braved the rain to watch the game, occupying all the seats in the entire Navy Stadium, and also unfolding a "covered" conference, which was a spectacle.</p>
<p>In the competition, the South China players used their superb skills to perform cleverly and beautifully, and the connection was perfect. Although the field was wet and the ball was heavy, it was unavoidable to be strenuous, but they had control over the ball and the passing was appropriate. Therefore, under this situation of excellent technology, they finally ran on the road to victory, killing the foreign sailors to a complete defeat by a score of four to zero.</p>
<p>I can see that the only main reason for South China's great victory this time is the success of avoiding the heavy and taking the light. On this point, it is clear that it is the role of skill. The body sizes of the South China front-line players are not as strong as those of the foreign sailors. If they did not use skills to find a way out, and wanted to rely solely on strength, this would be impossible. The South China players can take advantage of open positions, avoid the interception of the Navy's defenders, and deliberately play tricks, luring them and shaking their defensive center of gravity, so that even Hendy, whose skills are the most stable, cannot take care of it. As a result, the Navy had to be defeated.</p>
<p>Zhuandi was the left inside forward, and the performance was the most fierce, but the more heroic he was, the easier it was to fall into the trap, because South China, not long after the start of the game, Li Yaorong immediately switched positions with Hua Beihua because of pain in his right foot, and the front-line attack also focused on the right side. He Di was properly defensive, and was inevitably busy dealing with it, and had to disobey the attack, and this move was exactly what South China's front-line had planned to avoid the heavy and take the light. Therefore, when Bei Hua lured him from the middle and transferred him away, he gave Feng Jingxiang an opportunity to take advantage of. Looking at the three goals that Jingxiang won, the position he stood in each time he knocked on the door was farther away from He Di, but very close to the goal, so it is clear that the South China front-line's tactical strategy is to avoid the heavy and take the light, and also to avoid the heavy and take advantage of the weakness.</p>
<p>The forwards scored a total of four goals, and Jingxiang alone accounted for three, which is a great contribution, but don't forget that Bei Hua helped with strength, and his contribution is also not small. The advantage of Bei Hua lies in the beauty of the transmission and the ability to cooperate with Jingxiang to the extreme. If Zhaorong had not appeared on the stage with an injury, the connection between the three forwards would have been better and there would be no doubt.</p>
<p>Jingxiang's skills have indeed reached the peak, and he can act according to circumstances, and has both wisdom and strategy. Since Zhaorong was injured and unable to walk well, he immediately changed his strategy, focusing on seeking progress with the strength of South China, and using his own strength to try to make up for the position that Zhaorong should have walked but did not walk. There is also one thing that is quite rare: after 70 minutes of fighting, everyone was covered in mud, but Ma Jingxiang's uniform had very few stains, because he ran steadily, stood firmly, and scored three goals without falling once, which is really rare.</p>
<p>Luo Liaowen's performance in this battle is quite commendable, and he is much better than before. Deng Lusen's performance has recently been in the peak state, and the same was true in yesterday's battle. He can be called the number one right winger in Hong Kong today. Zhaorong did not have a good description due to the pain of the old creation, but winning the second goal was his indirect contribution.</p>
<p>The South China front-line's half-time performance was better than the first half, and Guo Yingqi and Liang Rongzhao made great contributions in the defensive aspect, and these two also contributed to the offensive aspect, but Rongzhao's deliberate pretense should not be changed. He was named by the referee in yesterday's battle because of this, which was too much, but why did Rongzhao deliberately cause trouble? Liu Qingcai is also considered to be working hard, but it is difficult to restrain the activities of Armstrong and Zhong Shi, but he is not used to living on the left, so there should be forgiveness.</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng and Li Guowei repeatedly rescued dangers in the first half, turning danger into safety, and being able to protect a clean victory without losing a goal was really hard work, and Bao Jiaping also had many good works.</p>
<p>The reason for the Navy's defeat is that the hard-line skills of the defense side are not enough to resist the strategic progress of the South China forwards, but the performance of their three forwards in the first half was good. The advance and retreat seem to have the style of Goringden. Internal defenders Xuan Di and Ge Lianchen are also very fierce, but they only use force to control people, and eventually become exhausted, and they are not as good as the South China forwards' clever minds, so in the second half they finally collapsed.</p>
<p>Few of the forwards are good at shooting, and even if they have opportunities, they will miss them. When South China was threatened in the first half, if its forwards had shooting shoes, South China might have lost first.</p>
<p>I missed one thing, and I have to add a few words here. Yingqi stuck to Touban and refused to let go in yesterday's battle, making Touban unable to attack. It seems that Yingqi's body size is half the size of Touban, but he can use clever skills to restrain Touban.</p>
<p>Now that the Navy has been defeated and cannot get the championship, even the runner-up seat is a problem, because Eastern has also completed twenty games and scored twenty-nine points, which is the same as the Navy's position, and they still have to have another runner-up final to determine who is difficult to defeat. Eastern has returned from Saigon today, and the date of the final with the Navy will not be far away. At that time, Eastern has Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting to help, and the military appearance is very neat. Maybe they can defeat the Navy and win the runner-up, but the war period is not yet determined, so let's wait for the next time. The lineup of the two armies in yesterday's battle is as follows:</p>
<p>South China South</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping Li Guoji Li Tiansheng Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao Guo Yingqi Luo Douwen Ye Beihua Feng Jingxiang Li Zhaorong Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Navy Team</p>
<p>Dejiachen Xuan Di Gelianchen Gao Lushi Taneng Hanniweiluo Molisi Tuoban Jinbeilu Zhong Shi Yan Langshide</p>
<h3>First Half Battle Situation</h3>
<p>(Ten Minutes) The two armies are in a very fierce confrontation. Yan Langshide gets the transport from the rear, and rushes to camp like a fast horse, forcing a corner kick. After the opening, Taneng advances rapidly in the crowd and shoots violently at the door. His labor is exceptionally dangerous. Fortunately, Shen Heng swept his feet and saved the ball out of danger.</p>
<p>(Fifteen Minutes) Rongzhao gives the ball to Bei Hua, Bei Hua earns it over Han Niweiluo, and transfers it to Guangsen. Guangsen shoots violently, but is blocked out of bounds by Xuan Di, getting a corner kick. Guangsen takes the kick, which is beautiful and exquisite, but it is a pity that Jingxiang raised it high.</p>

<p>(Seventeen Minutes) Douwen's courage suddenly increases, dribbling the ball and rushing forward, charging and running in the Navy's position, losing and regaining it, and shooting hard at the door within reach, hitting Dejiachen's body and bouncing out. Zhaorong shoots again, with a very good angle, but the momentum is not strong, and it is saved by Dejiachen again.</p>
<p>(Si Minutes) Rongzhao intercepts Jinbeilu's ball and passes it to Zhaohua, who dribbles it up and cleverly passes it to Guangsen. Gao Lushi can't intercept it and loses a corner kick. Guangsen opens it, and the momentum is beautiful. Jingxiang gently shakes his copper head in the crowd, and the ball rolls into the net. (One to Zero)</p>
<p>(Twenty-two Minutes) Armstrong is unusually lively, and has another chance to copy into the corner of the South China goal. Fortunately, Qingcai returned in time and desperately blocked it, preferring to lose a corner kick. Armstrong's main kick fell to the opposite side and retreated without success.</p>
<p>(Twenty-three Minutes) Molisi took advantage of the South China defense's emptiness and suddenly moved forward. Guowei Fu defended, and Jiaping abandoned the door to fight. Molisi's foot was not agile, and he did not shoot at an empty door, and even hit the ball into the wilderness.</p>
<p>(Thirty Minutes) The Navy launched another fierce attack. The giant Tuoban attacked in front of the South China goal. Jiaping hugged the ball tightly and kicked it out in time. In an instant, Jinbeilu was bitterly pressing in the corner of the door, and the situation was very fierce. Only Jiaping calmly engaged in the matter and hugged the ball to escape the danger.</p>
<h3>Second Half Battle Situation</h3>
<p>(Five Minutes) Zhaorong gets Jingxiang's wonderful pass, crosses the customs and cuts the generals, and shoots and shoots. The ball rushes towards the Navy's city gate. Gelinchen raises his feet to block it and sends Ban Luoye, losing a corner kick, and almost scoring on his own goal.</p>
<p>(Fifteen Minutes) The Navy attacks with the ball. Within ten minutes, it is bitter to kill the South China guards. The crisis only passed when Han Niweiluo fouled, and Gelinchen fouled. Zhaorong took a free kick, and Jingxiang headed the ball in the Navy's hinterland, and hit the red heart again. (Two to Zero)</p>
<p>(Twenty-three Minutes) Guowei kicked a long ball, and Jingxiang rushed forward to win it, like a wild horse off the rein, galloping forward. Taneng, Gao Lushi, and Xuan Di and others blocked him on three sides, but they were ineffective, and Jingxiang finally took a city in one go. (Three to Zero)</p>
<p>(Thirty-three Minutes) South China steadily engaged in the matter, and did not slacken its strength because the end of the game was approaching. Guangsen sent another wonderful ball in the urgent attack, and Bei Hua shot lying on the ground, establishing a merit. At this point, it became a score of four to zero, and South China won the championship.</p>

<h3>How to Practice Freestyle Swimming</h3>
<p>— Pan Congbo</p>
<p>If the body can almost float to the surface, adding the movement of the limbs will make it float even higher and move forward. Beginners who understand this can easily learn as long as they are not afraid of hardship and can improve very quickly. The lower limbs must be straightened. Do not forget that the knees will be impacted by the water and the lower limbs, so the lower limbs should be bent and extended to kick the water. The small force of the lower limbs comes from the activity of the thigh joint. Therefore, the lower limbs are easily fatigued. When practicing at the beginning, start from simple and gradually move to complex. First, do the movements of the lower limbs. Lower your head, and the upper limbs still extend forward together. The floating body will completely float to the surface due to the alternating kicking movements of the lower limbs.</p>
<p>For the upper limb movements, one hand often enters the water in front of the head, and the other hand is drawn out of the water from the waist. After it comes out of the water, the hand entering the water is inserted into the water. The upper limbs in the water are slightly bent and pushed backward, creating a mutual resistance with the water, like a boat being propelled forward by oars. The lower limbs constantly move up and down alternately, and the upper limbs are used in coordination. The freestyle swimming posture only lacks the breathing action.</p>
<p>The breathing action is different in the water and in the air. Daily breathing is best done with air passing through the nostrils, but when swimming, it is most suitable to inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. Why exhale through the nose? Because the freestyle swimming action requires the head to be slightly tilted to the left and right as the upper limbs crawl in the water alternately. Although the head position in freestyle swimming may vary depending on the use of other movements, the breath is always exhaled before the head is tilted to the side. That is, when it is facing forward, the remaining air is exhaled, preparing to take a deep breath of a large amount of air through the mouth when the head is exposed above the water on the side. If you do not inhale through the mouth, it will be difficult to inhale enough air in the short, quick intervals of the action. If you exhale in the water not through the nostrils, it is easy for water to rush into the mouth, and the breathing action will be immediately hindered.</p>
<p>The movements of the lower limbs, upper limbs, and breathing should not only be practiced in the water. During morning exercises, because the movements on land are easier to support, in addition to practicing the movements of each part separately, practicing the entire movement makes progress easier. How to perform the above movements is not convenient to describe in detail here. However, for breathing practice, in addition to not needing to use equipment, practicing with the water in the washbasin when washing your face is like practicing in the water.</p>
<p>The movements for practicing freestyle swimming have been described above, but it is not easy to become proficient. Not only is it not easy to become proficient, but it is also very hard. This requires the greatest determination to overcome difficulties. It is worth noting that you cannot learn for just one day in warm weather; otherwise, it is not surprising if you cannot master it even after three or five years.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if freestyle swimming is learned, one always feels that breathing is rushed and the movements are easily tiring. Before reaching a distance of three or five zhang, one becomes exhausted and cannot catch their breath. What can be done?</p>
<p>The inability to sustain breath and strength is certainly related to the strength of the physique. However, the failure to use breathing effectively and the improper use of muscles have an even greater impact. Because to get the head into a suitable breathing position, the head is often raised too high and swayed too violently to the left and right. The disadvantage of the former is that it changes the force of the limbs floating horizontally in the water, increasing the difficulty of the lower limbs supporting buoyancy. The latter affects breathing. Not only does the body sway from side to side, hindering forward movement, but the neck also feels easily tired, which can also lead to difficulty in breathing.</p>
<p>The so-called improper use of muscles refers to the failure to obtain opportunities for rest and relaxation between the continuous movements of the limbs. Not only does it easily lead to fatigue, but it also makes it impossible to exert the fierce force for forward propulsion, which is a great obstacle to improving swimming skills.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the limbs move, since they have a resisting effect with the water, they should also have movements that do not resist the water. This movement is intermittent. Although the swimming action does not stop, there is an opportunity for alternating work and rest. After the lower limbs kick the water, they are drawn upward again. The time when the upper limbs are drawn out of the water to prepare to be inserted into the water again is a good opportunity for the muscles to rest. At this time, the muscles should be relaxed, and the movements will naturally be more gentle and smooth.</p>
<p>It is necessary to practice diligently to improve freestyle swimming skills. Pay attention to your own physique and swimming technique. Increase the time and distance of each swim. Pay even more attention to the fact that poor habits may be magnified through long-term practice, which is not easy to correct. Only with correct posture can swimming skills be easily improved.

<h3>Rongye Brand Completion of Merit Ceremony: Awards Given Yesterday, Wellington Wins Exhibition Match</h3>
<p>The Rongye Brand competition organized by the Small Football League has come to a conclusion after months of intense battles, and the winners have been determined. Yesterday, the championship and runner-up exhibition match was held at London Garden, and prizes were awarded. Wellington won the championship, and Kitchee finished as runner-up. Although the weather was cloudy and rainy, the audience was still crowded. Both sides did not perform carelessly due to the final match and gave their all from beginning to end. Wellington used its original lineup, while Kitchee mostly filled the spots with substitutes. Although the strength was slightly inferior, they posed a serious threat to the Wellington team. Wellington won by two goals in the first half, mainly because Kitchee's goalkeeper was not good. Kitchee launched a counterattack in the second half, and Zhu Jincheng finally scored a goal. As a result, Wellington won by a score of two to one. Lin Huasheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Li Huilin of the Wellington team were the best players of the match, while Zhu Jincheng, Yin Zurong, and Chen Jiali of Kitchee were the outstanding players. The lineups of both teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Wellington</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening's Group B Basketball Game: Wah Hung Defeats Qing Zhi Team, South China Li Xing Also Wins</h3>
<p>There were three Group B men's basketball games last night. In the first game, Qing Zhi played Wah Hung. Qing Zhi's defense was unusually weak, while Wah Hung's entire team was brave and skillful, making the game one-sided. Hong Xiaotai, Huang Zhaopan, and Ma Weifen attacked with great success. Yu Ruixi, Situ Ying, Liang Song, Li Ming, and Yao Junjie also contributed. Under the counterattacks of Qing Zhi's Huang Jinyuan, Zhang Yun, and Liang Shihua, they made some achievements, but Wah Hung's front-line offense was fierce, winning by a score of fifty to twenty-eight. In the second game, South China played Qing Zhi. South China's coordination was appropriate, and Qing Zhi's forwards failed to attack evenly, allowing South China to break through. After the start of the game, Cheng Enrong, Liu Bingrong, and Lin and others opened fire on both sides. Wu Haifu, Deng Yaoming, and Deng Xihong also divided their troops to charge and kill. However, Fu Hua's momentum was overwhelming, and the entire army launched a fierce attack. At the end of the game, South China won by a score of fifty-three to thirty. In the final game, Li Xing played Qing Team. Li Xing is a strong team in this tournament and has many strong players. After the start of the game, Li Xing mobilized its entire army, with Lin Youpei, Lu Dezhang, Chen Yuting, and Chen Chengji attacking from left and right. The Qing Team tried hard to support them and was exhausted from blocking. Although Li Yinche, He Huanzhang, and Yu Yangang tried their best to counterattack, it did not help the overall situation. The entire Li Xing team was able to drive straight in, defeating the Qing Team by a large margin of seventy-eight to twenty-four.</p>

<h3>Literary Offensive</h3>
<p>— Huang Sheng</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is serious work, on the other hand, it is obscene and shameless. This sentence is exactly a portrayal of the cultural world here and now. The establishment of the Hong Kong branch of the Literary Association marks the beginning of the unity of progressive literary workers, which is a major event in the cultural world here. It will become an organization to promote cultural struggle, and the workers who are members will also provide their strength more actively and bravely - this represents the serious side.</p>
<p>And at this time, a certain faction is more thoroughly selling its personality, more thoroughly betraying the motherland, more thoroughly loyal to the × people, actively buying newspapers, buying backward writers, spreading toxins in larger quantities, creating black screens more skillfully, creating rumors and swindling more shamelessly, and shaking people's hearts. The motherland does not allow them to stand, and this place has become their lair - this represents the dirty side.</p>
<p>The fight between light and darkness should have reached the most tense stage!</p>
<p>As far as the literary world is concerned, the workers have begun to unite, and now is the time to exert collective strength. On the one hand, we must launch a research movement in a planned and systematic manner, and on the other hand, we must immediately take on the task of propagandizing the masses and combating traitors - the team has gathered, with vigorous vitality and a clear battle flag. Now it is time to launch an "offensive."</p>
<p>Unity for offense, not just defense!</p>
<p>To establish an offensive, I think, first of all, we must review our own team. We must have a practical self-examination. Are there any unserious aspects of our lives? Are there any undesirable tendencies in our work? Does our writing objectively benefit a certain faction? That is to say, do we cater to the low-level tastes of some people? Workers should help each other, understand each other, and encourage and supervise each other.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are not many workers gathered now. We cannot admit that a small number of workers can fully shoulder the current arduous tasks. On the one hand, countless literary youths must add a pair of hands to the establishment of the literary battle flag, and on the other hand, these countless literary youths can indeed become cadres on the literary front. The Ministry of Supervision is the bravest combatant in the offensive, not to mention that our battle will not be limited to this corner, but also to explore the tentacles of the battle into the mainland, or even into places farther away from the motherland. The acquisition and training of a large number of cadres is also the current task.</p>
<p>Again, at the time of launching this offensive, we must also carry out political work to the backward group. The backward people do not have a correct understanding, and their work benefits a certain faction and is more easily bought by a certain faction. Therefore, we must eliminate the attitude of contempt and disregard for this group of people, and try to win them over. Also, those who have mistakenly entered the net may not be without a sense of justice. Sometimes, due to professional relations, they do some ugly things against their conscience. We must disintegrate the enemy's camp and urge these people to wake up quickly.</p>
<p>The establishment and development of an offensive is naturally an arduous task. What I have discussed above are just some key points. Perhaps what is more important now is the deployment of the workers who have already gathered. Those who will take on this aspect of the attack, those who will take on a certain line of attack; and there is also the issue of the use of workers' weapons, those who are most suitable to use rifles, those who are most suitable to use hand grenades, or perhaps some people should use some old treasures such as knives, spears, swords, and halberds.</p>
<h3>The First Night at the Front Line</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Dragging my soft body, conquered by hunger and exhaustion, I walked out of the division headquarters. Based on the little experience I had when I came, we all thought we could go back. Unexpectedly, after walking out of the door not far, we were lost in the vast and boundless wilderness shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Our right front was illuminated by a frightening red light, and the deep blue sky, dotted with countless glittering little stars, was also reddened by the fierce fire. The sound of guns and cannons kept ringing densely together, as if to tear the world shrouded in darkness apart. In this deafening, chaotic sound, the machine gun sound, like hammering an anvil, was very clear, "tatatatata..."</p>
<p>"Which way to go?"</p>
<p>"I remember that we passed a dike when we came, how did we get into these wheat fields? There is no way to go, how to go?"</p>
<p>"Be careful! Don't go into the × people's defense line, you must know that this is the front line!"</p>
<p>After a brief discussion, everyone decided to return to the division headquarters. Walking in the dark for not far, suddenly, a messenger came out of the headquarters and led us back to the stone shed.</p>
<p>Nothing could be seen clearly on the road, and we closely followed each other, groping forward. But our feet were often blocked by something, almost falling to the ground. Sometimes, our feet were also trapped in some mud ponds, making it impossible to pull them out.</p>
<p>The night wind was a bit cold, and the wind was blowing in gusts, and the wheat seedlings in the field were rustling and shaking, as if the × people were walking out of the field. We walked silently, but kept our eyes wide open, conducting vigilance.</p>
<p>The sound of guns and cannons was still lively, and the red light was still so brilliant, so dazzling, like the moment the sun first comes out.</p>
<p>After passing through the warning line, we finally returned to the small room where we lived. Pushing the door open and looking inside, the room was full of more than ten comrades sleeping everywhere.</p>
<p>"Hey, haven't you eaten yet?" The only female comrade who hadn't fallen asleep yet, wearing her tweed coat, climbed up from a pile of sorghum stalks and greeted us.</p>
<p>"Not yet, have you eaten yours?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" she replied simply, and then lifted a basket of dry cold rice from the table and handed it to us; "Eat quickly! Eat quickly!"</p>
<p>We chewed a mouthful of dry cold rice and couldn't swallow it anymore. We looked at her pitifully, "Is there any vegetables?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is there any salt?"</p>
<p>"No either!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Everyone couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>We swallowed two mouthfuls of dry cold rice wolfishly, considering it a meal. But how to sleep? So many people in one place, and there is also a female comrade!</p>
<p>This female comrade's surname is Tang. It is said that when our troops were stationed in De'an, Jiangxi, she resolutely abandoned her family and school and joined our troops. This rare thing was reported in large print in the Jiangxi newspaper at that time. For this young female comrade, although others had a dismissive attitude towards her because of her working ability, I admired her very much. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, out of the 225 million female compatriots who account for the entire population, how many have sacrificed everything and come to the front line like her? Just for this point alone, I think she is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>"Get up, re-spread it so that we can sleep well. Otherwise, how can so many people sleep?"</p>
<p>"Get up, those who don't want to be slaves!..." Comrade Tang sang the March of the Volunteers in a funny way, which made the people who were being attacked by sleep couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>One to the east, one to the west, the people who were just about to fall asleep unwillingly climbed up. Everyone moved the table and the pile of furniture away, and each person was busy spreading the prepared gray felt on the ground. Comrade Tang also joined this lively competition, spreading the gray felt on the ground on the side near the door. Everything was covered with gray felt, but I was still holding my gray felt in my hand without a place to put it down.</p>
<p>"Where is the place where I sleep?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it possible to sleep next to Comrade Tang?" Everyone looked at me with a smile, as if they had done something得意.</p>
<p>"There..." I was embarrassed by the laughter, and couldn't help but laugh foolishly with them, and the room was filled with the energetic laughter of young people.</p>
<p>Looking at the unrestrained and frank way Comrade Tang was sleeping there, I also obediently laid down my gray felt. Contrary to my expectations, the laughter also disappeared with it. All that could be heard in the room was the sound of cannons outside the door ringing fiercely...</p>
<h3>"Eating Arsenic to Kill Tigers"</h3>
<p>— Hua Fu</p>
<p>Smart people in the world will never die out. They say: The first thing is to harm others to benefit oneself: the second thing is to benefit oneself and others: the third thing is - no, the third thing is terrible -, the third thing is not to harm oneself and others: as for the fourth, to benefit others without benefiting oneself, only the greatest fools in the world would be willing to do so, and it is even more terrible! In short, smart people have their own unique spirit. They want to live and not die. Even if they have to settle for the next best thing, they should live evilly rather than die well. They say that it is better to live badly than to die well, so eating arsenic to kill tigers becomes the object of their ridicule.</p>
<p>When they encounter a tiger, they must offer pigs and sheep to satisfy the tiger's appetite. When there are no pigs and sheep, the tiger stares at them, seemingly wanting to get them to be satisfied, and they at most avoid it and never dare to resist. They say, the tiger is such a huge creature, how dare we touch its hair and ask for trouble. If they see that they can't escape, they can only kneel on the ground and beg pitifully. Even when the tiger opens its mouth to swallow them, even though they have arsenic in their hands, they are unwilling to stuff it into their own mouths, hoping that they can eventually be "spared from the tiger's mouth." But the result of such people, we can imagine, is nothing more than being a snack for the tiger without any mercy.</p>
<p>Any smart person in the world may not see a tiger wanting to eat him, and indeed be so stupid. However, there are indeed such smart people in the world who see a crisis that is as likely to kill them as a tiger, and if they can't escape or fight, they never dare to bravely go to their death and fight to the death. They only want to beg, and are indeed doing the business of "asking for the tiger's skin." They say that survival is the first priority; mutual destruction is not worthwhile.</p>
<p>They dream of "coexistence and co-prosperity" with the tiger; they think that the tiger also has humanity and can reason with it; they even think that even if they are eaten by the tiger, they can still survive in another way - as a changgui (a ghost that serves the tiger). Getting employed by the tiger master. Therefore, they think that their theory is complete and the facts are thorough, and they have long been in an invincible position. As long as they seek peace with the tiger, they can live in this way or in that way. Only resisting the tiger is, in their view, the end of the road.</p>
<p>In fact, tigers are often "paper tigers." Once they are pierced, their ugliness is exposed. Even if they are not paper tigers, they are just "dog-headed tigers." Based on their instincts, they can only steal pigs and sheep, and they don't have the courage and strength to eat people. As long as people see them, they will be given a head-on blow! Any weapon will do, it doesn't have to be a quick gun. If it really is a big worm with golden eyes and a white forehead that will indeed eat people, then we should fight desperately.</p>
<p>I praise the spirit of fighting some tigers. With this spirit, I think that if tigers were sentient, they would retreat three times. The ridicule of smart people is to prepare to be changgui. Since we are not prepared to be changgui, what do we care about ridicule! We base ourselves on this spirit, eradicate the tiger plague, and we can see the ridicule of smart people falling on their own heads.</p>
<h3>The Sea of Dreams</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>In the spring, the god of Xing Tang Rou, as a gust of gentle wind, sent me into the sea of dreams!</p>
<p>I floated in the sea of dreams, sailing in that flower-like boat, arbitrarily heading east and west!</p>
<p>The sea of dreams is great! This is a world of supreme bliss, with all the treasures that mankind does not have. There are Pearl Island, Rose Forest, beautiful birds skimming across the sky, and lively fish leaping on the seabed. The clear seawater is free from waves; this sea of dreams is full of pleasant air!</p>
<p>The boat moved forward and reached another world. The seawater was yellow, and the sky was covered with gray clouds. The fish in the port were staying in the water in a daze. How sad and desolate this is!</p>
<p>The boat only needs to have a way to go. She will not stop. One end of the sea of dreams is a terrible world. Thunderstorms and typhoons raise the waves, like mountains. The boat cannot stop. The big fish in the middle open their blood basins and swallow everything!</p>
<p>How terrible! The Sea of Dreams. I don't want to throw myself into it again!</p>
<p>I summoned up my courage. Bravely, I shook the boat, this terrible world!</p>
<p>The Sea of Dreams is vast and boundless. The power of the boat will never find land.</p>
<p>I can only clench my teeth, hold my breath, and jump from the boat into the air.</p>
<p>Sea of Dreams, this illusory vortex, I will never throw myself into your arms again!</p>
<h3>Liu Er Kills Bandits (Anti-Japanese Ballad)</h3>
<p>— Jing Xi</p>
<p>Snow lies deep on the head of Changbai Mountain, the waters of the Heilong River flow clear. Near the mountain and by the water lives a farmer named Liu Er, who diligently cultivates wheat year after year. He enjoys the four seasons, working from sunrise to sunset. He hates only the unprovoked invasion of the ×× pirates, who turn every place their soldiers reach into a desolate village. Women are raped, men are murdered. This Liu Er was forced by the pirates to carry ammunition, whipped day and night like an animal. One day, he followed the army to outside the gate of Suqian City, where the Japanese devils set up camp in formation.</p>
<p>Our planes roared in the sky, the sound of cannons shook the earth like thunder. Loyal and brave soldiers shouted as one, the bandit soldiers scattered like startled birds and beasts. Liu Er saw the bandit soldiers scatter, and a patriotic heart arose spontaneously. In the blink of an eye, he seized a Japanese rifle and began to fight the bandit soldiers. Although surrounded by countless bandit soldiers, Liu Er didn't care. He shot at those far away and stabbed those nearby, killing countless bandit soldiers. As he fought, he shouted: "Now is the time to achieve merit and kill bandits!" His shouts echoed across the fields, and the forced cooks were moved to tears. They immediately rose up within the bandit camp, their shouts shaking the earth and mountains. The cooks moved the gun troops from behind, trapping the bandit soldiers on both sides. Under the artillery fire, they met their end. The beautiful rivers and mountains were returned to China as before, and our army celebrated with joy. This is the story of Liu Er killing bandits, may our compatriots love their country and family, and may their descendants resist the invaders.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>In a state between sleeping and waking, she sometimes covered her head with the blanket, sometimes let her hands and feet fall outside the blanket, and sometimes drew out a hum, a sigh, a broken cry. Was her restless sleep disturbed by the snow? No, the snow in Manchuria disturbs those who peacefully sleep in Manchuria.</p>
<p>She woke up a few times, each time raising her head to look under the window, and then letting her head fall back onto the pillow. Because the snowy night in Manchuria was still outside the window. This night, she felt, was the longest night of her life.</p>
<p>When she woke up, it was still dark; because the factory sirens nearby rang, starting to order workers to start the machines, and incidentally waking her up.</p>
<p>The snow outside the window had been falling all night, and it still didn't stop. The snow on the road was already more than a foot deep, and the tall walls of the past were a few feet shorter. The snow seemed to be angry.</p>
<p>The gloomy morning light gradually brightened in the darkness. On the flagpole by the Songhua River that hadn't been broken by the storm, the flag that betrayed the motherland would be raised again. Was the snow in Manchuria angry for that reason?</p>
<p>She got up in unrest, more tired than before she slept, and walked to the window. The inner window was warmed by the fire wall and was as clear as usual, while the outer window was frozen with thick frost flowers; her gaze to the outside was blocked by the frost flowers. She opened the inner window and used her breath to melt a cluster of frost flowers on the outer window, casting her gaze through. The street outside the window, in the hazy tone, was still familiar; but the most familiar home was far away, as if it were beyond the sky. Even if dreams grew wings, it would be difficult to fly there. She wanted to break through the outer window and jump down regardless of the height below; but the outer window was nailed shut with long nails. The home she had once grown tired of walking to now evoked her longing. A mere night of separation felt like an eternity of thousands of years, so when would the distant years to come end... She dared not think anymore, thinking further would be like a long journey for a tired traveler. The longing of people grows more distant the more they think about it.</p>
<p>Later, she fell asleep more peacefully in bed. Her sleeping posture was like that of a homeless stray dog, lodging in a stranger's house on a wandering journey, restraining its limbs, with uneasy small movements, presumptuousness, worry, and fear still remaining in its sleeping expression. (April 5th)</p>
