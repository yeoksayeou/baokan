<h3 id="c1">論所謂「中蘇密約」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近頃歐洲國際，縱橫樟闔，鈎心團角，各取所需而結為同盟，訂立協定，盛行一時，方興未艾：餘風所被，或竟謂遠東亦復爾爾。如昨前報載路透社東京電，謂有日報二家，刊布中國與蘇聯締結密約，甲報謂蘇聯對華，供給飛機駕駛員與機匠，俱無限量：又供給借欵四萬萬圓，備中國購置軍火所需，以五千萬圓聯合設立中蘇軍火進口公司。乙報謂蘇聯援華抗日，要索代價；事由孫科氏在莫斯科談判，其旣獲蔣委員長核准者，有下列諸點：其一，中國必先商諸莫斯科，始得接受任何第三國之調停；其二，中國應將國民政府內及其他管轄區中之主和派，予以絕對取締；其三，中國對於中央軍與共產軍以及各省軍，其配備與待遇，必須一律；其四，劃甘陝新彊三省為行政特別區，以毛澤東為主席，純由共產軍駐守，蘇聯得開發三省富源，並派駐軍官一員，為軍事代表：其五，中國應聘蘇聯專家，為軍事訓練官，訓練士兵與飛行員；其六，西安莫斯科間，經由蘭州哈密迪化，闢陸空路線：而蘇聯則於物質上技術上，無限制的援助中國，為交換條件云云。</p>
<p>如此電傳，我人為時間所限，尙不及聞悉中蘇兩國當局之若何表示，姑就所傳而分析之，則無一而不與眞情實理相刺謬；蓋以我人所知所信：自中國發動全面抗戰以來，除侵略國之儔，無不予中國同情與援助，初非蘇聯一國。蘇聯在物質上技術上儘量援華，由來已久，初不自今始；基於道義，基於互信；故無條件，亦無密約。蘇聯豐於軍火產額而絀於金條銀塊，中國期待蘇聯者亦在彼而不在此，故始未聞議及所謂借欵；况政府與政府直接授受，更何待撥欵設公司？兩國航空綫，闢於重慶與莫斯科之間，早經公開試航，何必要索之為密約條件。凡此數端，在事實，在精神，皆視日報傳稱者為高：彌可珍重，尤日報所不克衡量，不能理解也。餘如所謂聘請專家，中國歷來邀約客卿，為數甚多，顧乃當局自主之行動，豈有國際條約之拘束？中國為抵抗侵略而戰，亦為爭取自由而戰，豈甘以聘請專家之自由，喪諸所謂密約？又如謂劃三省為特區，何人主政，何軍駐守，何國專利；此乃侵略者之欲求，擬諸蘇聯則不稱！又如所謂各軍配備與待遇之一律，前嘗由我軍事當局斥為挑撥離間之辭：蓋待遇一律，行之已非朝夕，而配備不齊則為事實所限：且抗戰以來，隊伍以方面分，絕無所謂中央軍共產軍之分；配備隨事實所容許，而逐漸充實改進，尤不以方面而異。凡此數端，不但反證之以事實，可以斷言其不然，亦得以情理推知中蘇兩方决不以此為密約條件也！至於非先商承莫斯科，不得接受他國調停；以及絕對取締主和派云云，其辭若有憾於蘇聯，實謀所以誣中國政府赤化，而取為擬讓密約之資料耳。</p>
<p>國際旣有矛盾，即有利害；旣有利害，卽有友敵：旣有友敵，或交惡交戰，或結同盟，或訂協定，或、締密約；各視所需，各取所宜，固慣用之辦去，亦慣見之方式，原不足駭異者也。况此所謂辦法與方式者，雖必有其後果，然就大體言之，謂為條約產生時勢，毋寧為時勢產生條約；如英法同盟，乃英法結合之產物，非以同盟使英法結合；如德意同盟，乃德意結合之產物，非以同盟使德意結合；中蘇締盟，初非絕不可能；而英法保障波蘭羅馬尼亞之後，蘇聯在西方所感受之威脅稍弛，則在東方更趨積極之理由愈多，亦卽中蘇之共成為安定遠東之主力者，其條件亦愈備。是以中蘇兩國（或範圍不止兩國）若在最近將來，採取合理之辦法，有何重要表見，有何顯著發展，皆屬不足駭異之現象：顧仍必以相互為方式，以平等自由為原則，決非若日報所傳之密約，是可斷言耳。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國民參政會論 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 西園</p>
<p>國民參政會產生於抗戰之中，成立於抗戰週年之日。它的孕育籌備是在南京失陷以後，有少數妥協投降的份子正在散播毒菌，而全國軍民與民族領袖却在堅持抗戰，再接冉厲的時候。當時一切愛國志士，均積極要求建立民意機關，推行民主政治，以便政府集中國力，動員人力物力，堅持抗戰到底，以爭取最後勝利。因為正如民族領袖蔣委員長所說：「以前一般人士對於抗戰有許多批評，大抵以為過去我們只作到軍事的動員，而沒有發動全國政治的力量，使全國民衆動員來參加抗戰」（在國民參政會第一屆大會開幕禮中致詞）。到去年四月國民黨召集臨時全國代表大會「以現值×軍入寇，國民代表大會不能卽行召集，同時在非常時期中，亟應團結全國力量，集思廣益，以利國業之决定與推行，故决議組織民意機關，俟制定國民參政會組織法，即召集國民參政會」。同時在臨時大會宣言中又指出：「抗戰之勝負，不僅取决於兵力，尤取决於民力，民力之發展與民權之增進，相為因果，故組織民衆，訓練民衆，為發展民力之必要工作，亦為增進民權之必要條件」，而「自治興自衛並重」，「自由與統一兼顧」，又為發展民力與增進民權所必須嶺守之原則。國民黨這一决定確實能够符合民意，的確是補救過去政治動員落在軍事動員後面這一缺點的初步而具體的方法。</p>
<p>接着臨全大會這一决定之後，國民政府卽於去年四月十二日公佈國民參政會組織條例十五條。根據條例底規定，國民參政會底性質，一方面它是集思廣益的機關亦卽供政府諮詢的機關（如條例第一條「國民政府在抗戰期間，為集思廣益團結全國力量起見，特設國民參政會」底規定），他方面它又具有着普通立憲國家的國會所同具的决議權、建議權及買詢權，所以它同時又是一個相當民意機關（如條例第五條一在抗戰期間，政府對內對外之重要施政方針，於實施前，應提交國民參政會决議之」，第六條「國民政會參得提出建議案於政府「及第七條『國民參政會有聽取政府施政方針報吿及向政府詢問案之權』等底决定）。這樣，就性質來說，它雖還不是眞正的民意機關，但已具有相當民意機關的作用。其次，就產生底方式來說，國民參政員雖然是用選任的方法產生的，而不是由人民直接選舉出來的：但政府所選任的二百名參政員，却包括很廣，各省市，各黨派，各民族，各界以及海外僑胞，都有份子參加，因此，也能相當地把民意反映出來。</p>
<p>『國民參政會成立最重大的意義和目的，就是要集中全民族的力量對侵略的勢力作殊死的鬥爭，以求得抗戰的勝利和建國的成功』（蔣委員長）。因此，國民參政會的組織，在中國政治發展的歷史上有重要的意義。第一次大會於去年七月六日召集於漢口，當時正值徐州撤退，武漢危急的時候，故全國人民對於戰時相當民意機關——國民參政會的成立，咸抱一致擁護態度，並對首次會議提出了許多意見，交付各參政員提出首次會議，以便提供政府採納施行。而當時最中心的問題乃是：如何堅持抗戰與爭取最後勝利，如何具體的進行保衛武漢爭取第三期抗戰勝利，如何去鞏固與擴大民族統一戰線興推進民主政治的發展。首次會議的結界，一般的達到了通通符合民意的决議，這表現在休會言宜和許多重要决議上，如確定了『抗戰到底，爭取國家民族之最後勝利』的國策，如宣布了『各黨各派合作的抗日民族統一戰綫』的方針；如通過了『擁護抗戰建國網領』，『改善各級行政機構』，『設立省縣參政會』，『買行民主政治』、『在抗戰時期改善民生』等等議案。</p>
<p>首次大會于去年七月十五日閉幕，卽行休會。至去年十月二十八日復於重慶召集第二次大會，這次大會召集的時候，正是國軍退出廣州武漢以後，亳無疑義地，我國抗戰巳進到一個更艱苦的階段，一方面×人和漢奸正利用這個時機，大造謠言，謂中國此時定會發生分裂並走上妥協投降的道路，同時，親日派主和派以及失敗主義者，又散布悲觀失望無辦法的空氣，專實上在為×人助長聲勢。國民參政會第二屆大會在這樣嚴重的關頭來舉行，自然引起全國人民和國際友人底密切注意。這次大會，針對着當前嚴重的局勢，堅决地打擊了親日派主和派以及失敗主義者對×妥協投降的企圖，粉碎了日本法西期××造謠誣蔑挑撥離間底毒計，並熱烈地擁匯最高領袖蔣委員長及其堅持抗戰决不屈服的宣言：關於這一點，從大會把陳參政員紹禹等七十三人提『擁護蔣委員長和國民政府加緊民族團結堅持持久　案』，參政員張一應等四十一政人提『為抗戰到底宜由本會决議宣曾請政府明令公布以防反閩而定人心案』，陳參政綴嘉庚等二十一人提『在日×未退出我個土前不轉言和案』，王參政員造時等六十六人提『參政會應發表宣言擁獲蔣委員長吿國民書號召全國同盟一致奮起繼續抗戰案』。合昨通過了下列决議：『擁護蔣委員長所宣示全面抗戰為持久抗戰爭取主動之政府旣定方針，今後全國國民應在蔣委員長領導之下，堅决抗戰，决不屈服，共守弗論，以完成抗戰建國之任務』，表現得最為明白。然而當通過這個决議時並不是沒有經過這大的爭執的，當時對抗戰前途失去信心，對民族力量妄自菲薄的王××及其少數羽翼甚至在會內外企圓掀起和戰的討論，當時汪××不僅公開祖護和贊揚個別參政員主和的曾論，企圖打消陳參政員嘉庚等『在××未還出國土前，凡公務員有敢談和平者一律以漢奸賣國賊論」的提案；而且公然替不付表决擁護蔣委員長及共抗戰到底宣言的參政員作辯護，硬要張君勵在參政會上作包含反對蔣委員長內容的那個提案的報吿，企圖以此來打擊領導抗戰領袖的威儒，以便動搖人心和影響國策；他更陵使陶希聖等拚命反對陳參政員紹禹等所提『尅服困難，渡過雞關，持久抗戰，爭取勝利』的議案，企圖籍此來破壤××××××的團結；然而由於全國人民與大都分參政員的努力奮鬥，終於揭穿和戰勝了汪××破壞抗戰和破壤團結的陰謀之結果，注××不僅未能利用國民參政會去作　×投降的工具，而且反而暴露了他媚×求和的陰謀，這就是國民參政會第二屆大會的一大收獲。</p>
<p>其次，大會又通邊了鄒參政員韜奮等七十四人提『請撤消圖書雜誌原稿審查辦法以充分反映與論及出版自由案』，表示着參政員對於民主政治的推進和民權自由的保陣，是在盡着最善的努力。最後，大會又通過了梁漱溟李元鼎王亞明史良等提案合併通過的『改良兵役實施法案』，林祖涵等二十一人提『嚴懲漢奸傀儡案』，吳玉章等三十二人提『加强國民外交案』，江恆源等二十一人提『職業教育實施方案』等二十餘案，這些都是對於堅持抗戰爭取勝利的具體辦法的建議，對當前的困難，提出了切合實際的解决解辦法。</p>
<p>這次大會成功不僅表現在通過的電些决議上，不僅表現在討論和通過議案時的熱烈爭辯和精誠團結上，不僅表現在參政員積極負責建議質問和政府各院部主管長官誠懇解答問題態度上：而且也表現在討論問題時絕大多數參政員都互相捐棄成見。互相尊重人格。雖然有熱烈的爭辯，但很少有無味的糾紛，爭辯是必要的，能够使問題更淸楚，能够使不同的意見趨於一致，極大多數參政員能够本着『對基本國策不讓步，對個別具體問題可商討』的原則，這正是大會成功的主要原因。</p>
<p>然而這次參政會工作也有缺點，最主要的就是預先的準備不够，事前不僅對參政會未提交任何議案而且未考慮到如何使參政員諸公不遠數千里而來，能有事先了解和研究問題的機會，以至仍如前次大會一樣參政員都只是在步入參政會會場開始工作之後，才開始收到某些材料而難于認眞研究。在各部會的許多報吿方面，在會議的日程方面，在提案的研究方面，都是缺乏預先的準備工作。其次是表現在具體辦法上討論不够，這次會議八十餘提案，比上次一百多提案已少經得多了，但尙未能集中幾個具體而有內容的議案加以詳細的討論，因此效果也就有限。</p>
<p>所幸第二屆參政會閉幕之後，有一部分參政員能够本着在會議上努力之精神，到前綫去視察戰况，慰問軍隊，到後方去考察民情，幫助政府推進各種工作，這是很值得表揚的事情。</p>
<p>經過三個多有的休會，國民參政會第三屆大會又於本年二月十二日在重慶開會。從第二屆大會到第三屆大會，雖然僅僅祗有三個多月的時間，但是在自衛抗戰中的中國，却經歷着重大的考驗和邁進。第三屆大會有別于前兩大會的生要特點，是在于：</p>
<p>第一，這次大會是在××××××之後舉行的，在這個期間，國內團結，國共合作，抗日民族統一戰綫及各抗日黨派的關係已有若干的進步；</p>
<p>第二，在經過廣州武漢棄守後，和平妥協雖一時表面化，但是在蔣委員長的堅强領導，前綫將士全國人民堅持抗戰到底的壓力之下，已暫時消聲匿蹟，而在×××××××××之後，更便堅持抗戰到底的國策得到了絞鞏固的基礎；</p>
<p>第三，降×求和的汪××己經解除了議長之職、這將使這次參政會議在基本國策上——堅持抗戰和外交方針上能够得到比較團結一致的意見；</p>
<p>第四，蔣委員長親兼議長，這將使參政會有利抗戰設施的意見更能迅速的反映給政府和軍事當局，以減免過去參政會的議案輾轉延緩而不能迅速實現之流弊。</p>
<p>三屆大會在全國一致堅决打擊近衛的誘降企圖，××的乞和謬舉的熱烈空氣中，使參政會全體一致更堅决地親密地團結在抗戰國策的周圍，而通過了擁護政府國策案：『鄭重决議，抗戰已定方針必須支持到底』，並號召全國國民『堅其信心，齊其步伐，一心一德，徹始徹終，以復我領土主權興行政之完整，而完成抗戰建國之大業』。這個决議的堅决語調，尤其通過决議時之嚴肅熱烈，全體一致，他强有力的表明了我全國人民之抗戰不屈，堅持到底的鐵的意志；反映着兩次大會之間的重大的進步——『轉危為安』的進步。</p>
<p>三屆大會的重要和進步更在于他不僅通過了擁護國策的决議，而且在于他審議了實行國策的計劃，就是政府提出的第二期作戰的各種施政計劃，雖然這個計劃還僅是大綱要目，缺乏具體的數字與進度，但是究下失為是第二期抗戰中重大的進步的表現，為着爭取第二期抗戰的勝利，我們需要有各方面配合和聯系的，以軍事第一勝利第一為依歸的計劃，這計劃已于三屆大會中見其端倪。</p>
<p>大會吏本着政治重于軍事的重要原則，而通過了爭取政治上不斷進步的决議案多起。諸如董參政員必武提，『加强民權主義的實施，發揮民氣以利抗戰案』：羅參政員文幹等提『請政府實施醒賢與能以澄淸吏治案』；李參政員元鼎等提『擬請政府對于縣長愼重人選並提高待遇確定任期嚴厲監察與修正縣政而利抗戰建國案』等，都是關于改善政治的具體提案。周參政員覽等所提『請確立民主法治制度以奠定建國基礎案』。因為這一謂案鄭重指明了『我國政治之應以民主及法治為基礎，完成建國之原則，亦為國人所共曉。值此抗戰日益有利，建國正在開始之際，我人允宜淬厲民主法治之轉神，確立民主法治之制度，以期訓致早有實質的成就，而為意政預立鞏固的基礎』。</p>
<p>大會更在培養新生力量，建設軍事力量方斷，通過了黃參政員建中等提加緊擴大空黨建設案，及改善兵役實施，加強敵後工作等等重要决議。在經該建設文化教育方面，亦均有重大的貢獻，特別是對于川康建設，大會通過了組織川　建設期成會和視察團，這將對于我們抗戰後方的建設有重大推動力。</p>
<p>綜觀國民參政會前後三次大會的慶邊，對于抗戰時期的國策和各項政策，確會通過了不少的提案，但這些提案通過之後，××××採納者幾何，實行者幾何，×××××××　。××首屆大會沈參政員鈞儒等所提切實保陣人民權利案，及第二屆大會鄒參政員轁奮等所提保陣言論出版自由案通過後，在國內政治上這兩個很好的提案今後政府一方面須要參照參政食的决議而使計劃具體化實際化，另一方面須要切切實實的執行計劃，祇有實行才能使計劃有眞正的價值和效果。</p>
<p>參政會之所以能够成為戰時的相當民意機關，而且能够取得人民的相當信任的，是因為參政會成立以後半年來的工作，由于參政員的努力，由于全國與論和全國人民的監督，確能相當的反映民意，正如蔣議長在本屆參政會上所說：『召集國民參政會的目的，是在集中全國力量，以排除空前的國難，集合全國的意志，以樹立建國的基礎』。而且全國人民更渴望能够經過這種戰時民意機關的過渡辦法，以逹到眞正的民主政治上去，參政會的責任不僅在能够經常的反映人民的意見給政府，而目要協助政府來遂漸的推行民主政治，使民意得以發揚，政治更趨進步，如蔣議長所說：『我所誠懇希望于各位參政員同人的，就是大家首先確立互信與共信，一切都開誠相見，肝胆相見，造成和諧親睦有如一家兄弟年足的熊度，無事不可直言，無事不可共諒。一方面要各位畫量的徵取民意。切實的代表民意，充分的發揚民意；知無不言，言無不盡，使政府社會之間完全相互諒解，融洽貫通，沒有一絲一毫的阻滯。』</p>
<p>要使國民參政會能够完成這樣的任務，不僅需要全體參政員要更努力的奮鬥，而且需要全國人民共同的努力與監督。因為正如蔣議長在閉幕詞中所說：『本會的歷史的使命，是要建立民主政治的基礎，尤共是要建立永久的眞正的民主政治的基礎』，『一國的人民，如果不能關切他們自身的幸福，管理他們自已共同的事務，就是說，如果人民不能積極參加政治的話，他們就不能造成强固的國家。』</p>
<p>中國正開始向着民主政治的道路前進，這是抗戰的需要。在這方面，我們的成績雖還不大，但在全國上下共同的努力之下必能細續進步。我們固然不能說過渡的民意機關沒有它的抉點，但是大概說來，過去幾次大會的工作，對于政治的改革與抗戰的推進已表現着它的相當的效用，等到客觀環境容許它有進步的發展，它的效用是還可以擴大充實的，今後努力的方針在于加强這種根當民意機關的發展，把現在的國民參政會和各省正籌備中的參議會，逐漸變為眞正代表民意的機關。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日×在華北的經濟刦奪 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（晉西通訊）華北的淪陷，迄今巳一年有餘，日×軍閥究竟抓取些什麼！這個問題是每個中國的愛國同志所急於知道的，誠然，在我們持久抗戰開展了的現階段，支持我×雙方持久作戰的力量，已超出軍事政治方面的範圍，而已進到有否經濟上的作戰能力的領域果了，日×軍閥九次設法結束戰爭，儘可能的避免長期作戰，正是為了，缺乏經濟上的作戰能力的原因。同時。戰爭必不免的延續下去，那麼，日×在恐慌經濟問題的解决上，必然的在中國找尋出路。為此中國廣大的富源，却有一部資助了×人，這是多麼重大的天然損失啊！</p>
<p>這裏，我們要確定抗戰的基本戰略。要擴大了鬥爭的範圍，不僅在政治軍事上打擊×人的進攻，同時要摧毀了×人經濟侵略的基礎。在我抗戰的經濟建設上，一方面要建設起鞏固的國防經濟，一方面要儘可能的扶植民間經濟的活動，此外，必須對×的經濟企圓，予以有效的摧毀！這是我抗戰中經濟建設的三部曲，一部缺陷，便不能支持持久抗戰，為此，我們對于××的經濟企圖，便不能加以忽視，必須深切了解××各種陰謀的底蘊，方能籌劃有效的對業，這是我們搜集××經濟建設資料的動機。</p>
<p>一、日×的××「抓取機關」</p>
<p>1.偽中日經濟協議會：</p>
<p>執行經濟陰謀的××『抓取機關』在偽政府成立以後，即次第組織起來，去年三月間。日×寺內壽一與王逆克敏等簽署設置『中日經濟協議會』，由×偽五名委員組成，以王逆克敏任會長，决定以『華北產業資源的綜合的開發』為主要任務。</p>
<p>2.偽中國聯合準備銀行</p>
<p>在金融方面，偽中國聯合準備銀行是日×的主要煌『抓取機關』。偽政府于二月公佈銀行條例，任任逆時煌為總裁，資本金定為五千萬元，充當華北的中央銀行，為惟一發行鈔票銀行。規定偽聯銀行鈔票為新法幣，一律通用，把原來通行的各種法幣，至六月十一日以後，一律禁止流通。</p>
<p>3.强硬接牧海關後的關稅的更定：</p>
<p>偽政府成立後，卽强硬接收天津棄皇島兩海關，山東戰事結束後，復開關靑島海關，並規定日貨國貨與外貨輸出輸入的各不相同的條例，日×此種辦法，顯然含有經濟榷取的作用，所以也是抓取機關之一。</p>
<p>4.偽華北開發公司</p>
<p>偽興中公司于去年十月底，隨偽華北開發公司之設立卽行解消。所有一切過去由興中公司統制下的企業，均由華北開發公司接辦。並興中公司的原有社員。亦全部移交開發公司，現已將資本增至三寓萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>二，日×抓取些什麼</p>
<p>1.金融方面：</p>
<p>甲，盡量發行紙幣與吸收法幣：</p>
<p>我們深切了解日×的經濟恐慌，不能不藉濫發紙幣來彌補，上述偽中國駐合準備銀行為惟一發行鈔票機關，這上年底；發行額數已達一萬萬元之巨，其他偽蒙疆銀行，亦發行三千餘萬元，各實業銀行雖無確數統計，但亦不在少數。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 李金聲</p>
<p>五月三日的長空萬　無雲，在山城的重慶照滿了太陽的光亮，這淸朗的天氣，在四川是絕對難得的，但四川的人們並不歡迎如此的天氣！</p>
<p>正午教室裏的鐘聲敲了十二下，半空眞突然拖出了一股尖說嘶啞的聲音，唔！唔！唔！人們受了這喪音的刺激，慌亂異常的向大江兩岸散去，半小時尖銳嘶啞的聲音　刺人了，使整個的山城如陷在深夜裏一樣的沉寂，只有從遠處傳來洪，洪，洪，洪，重轟炸機的聲音，愈近，愈近了，緊接着巨烈的　炸聲，×機三十六架給我們造成了一個血肉橫飛的「五三」！</p>
<p>二時半，×機逸去了，大火却燒紅了整個山城，大樑子，神仙口，下新豐街，陝西街，儲奇門，火光均燒得通大澈地，千百條火龍，使勁的向半空中镠，劈劈翱剝響成了一片，偉大的建築物，矗然斜倒下去，燒裂了的磚石，瓦礫，向四處齊飛，眞是從來未有的大火！中了巨彈而未起火的草坪街半成了焦土，至誠巷，餅子巷完全　沒了，蒼坪街的左旁成了一個又餘深的大坑。最可慘的是僑奇門輸渡碼頭上，警報時，碼頭的乘客，工人，苦力，一齊躲到囤船上去，可恨的×子見有人多，便擲上了一顆巨彈，木板，鋼骨，七百多人的胳膊，脚，肉和血，向入浪滾滾的浩流中同飛，身子隨波濤翻　，人頭在江水中跳躍，長江的水被　血染紅了，七百躲人，這七百餘人，在血紅的江水中攪成了一團肉醬，被波浪吞蝕了，七百餘人馬上讓萬惡的日本×子毀滅了！</p>
<p>同樣可慘駭人聽聞的車情，發生在長江岸上，一個防空洞裏，專面共有三百餘人，×子在洞口投下了一顆然燒彈，　風向洞內吹去，硫磺氣味充滿了，一洞三百人全被熏死在洞夢了，襁抱中的小孩子變得長了一倍，耳朶鼻子裏流出了黑血。</p>
<p>被炸區內的難民，拚命搶救自己的孩子和母親，從瓦礫堆中死力拖出來的泥人，手和脚抽動一下便挺了，搶救的人呆一下，咬　咬牙關，蹤身跳入火窟專同歸于盡了，死前的呼聲，與燒焦的人肉臭，使人　絕砍死！在這火光燭大焰雲繚繞下面，我們的房屋接二連二的撲倒了，大公報館也隨着被毀滅了！</p>
<p>靑平會，和川鹽一里，也是被災區域，未中炸彈，却被毀掉了兩間樓房，×人將四十六斤的大石頭光顧了這兩個地方，×機上不但載了這石頭的炸彈，並且擲下了十大包用紅軟紙包着的一『新月牌』香烟。</p>
<p>「五三」血肉橫飛的『五三』，是×送給我們的一個最恥辱的日子，這一天×人欠不了我們三千餘條人命的一筆血債！</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>「五三」的血腥未乾，×人在『五四』給我們送來了一筆更大的血債！×人的處心是要將我們的新都摧毀，×機廿七架十一時使向我們飛行、曲曲　　，纔過了我們的防空　視哨於下午六時到總重慶市空，在×機陣容本來排成一個『人』字。飛過江岸時突然變威一字形，向市區普遍投彈，頓時燃起了大火，新豐街，陝西街，南　鬥，繡豐街，西四街，商業塲，都郵街，鷄街，太陽溝，白象街，打　街，　坪街，石板均……均燒成了火山，偉大的亨得利鐘表行及中國國貨公司的建築，在火光中慢慢燬滅。國泰大戲院全部焚燬，隔壁避難室五百餘人，連一個人也沒逃出來，眞是從來未有的浩劫！</p>

<p>兩路口，通遠門，是一帶高地，是一條很陡的向上去的馬路，大火燒起來的時候，像一座雄偉的火山，數千間房崖燒得一間不剩，火勢之大，就可以想見。</p>

<p>總計此次×機的狂炸重慶，燬去我們的房屋不下五千棟。炸死和燒死我們的同胞不下一萬餘人，全市繁華盡成灰燼，但我們軍事機關及政治經濟各機關毫無損傷，×機狂炸重慶的原因我們可以很淸楚的看到，×人確是為了各戰場的失敗，和我們一天大的軍事上的好轉，不得不出這種殘忍，恐怖的手段來掩飾他的泥足，但是我們想到被雖的同胞一定能忍住我們的血淚。咬緊我們的牙關，去向×子們索取這一筆血賬！（五·十·寫於刻後重慶）</p>
<h3 id="c15">貴州的苗民 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>【本報特稿】貴州省苗人的總數，當在三百七十萬左石，幾佔全省人口的一半，幷且苗民居住的地方，多為近山區域礦產豐富的地帶，故在開發西南聲中，對于怎樣動員夷族，這也是值得我們研究的問題。</p>
<p>在一般的醫籍，和地理教科書上，對于苗人的描寫，似乎已有了個刻板的公式，千篇一律地不外于「短衣，花裙，跣足，徒步，頭挽異髻，身佩銀飾，風俗守舊，不與漢化」。前面形容苗人衣飾的一段，還算確當，因為平常我們在貴州各地所能見到的苗女，皆是短衣穿裙，不過裙却並不完全是花的，也有是靑的顏色，而頭上髪　的樣子，則有許多不同的種類，有伽銀飾，也有並不掛備。因此，由於各種打扮的不一，漢人便分別給以不同的稱號，如靑苗，花苗，白苗，　頭苗，……一共不下七八十種，也有因為居住區域而稱呼的，如果東苗，西苗……。苗人中比較進步的則稱為夷人，和土家。大部份的夷人，和土家都能講漢話，和漢人簡直完全一樣，其中還有一種叫做宋家苗，可算是苗人中文化程度最高的份子，据他們自己說是戰國時候宋襄公的後代，並且還有文字。究竟是否可靠，則很難查攷了</p>
<p>苗人風風守舊，這話也是對的，四為苗人居住的區域，都在山邊的傭僻地帶，如松桃，銅仁，江口，龍里，番定……等縣的鄉村，交通非常困難，外界接觸的機會很少，故一切的風俗習慣都還是按、舊例，至於論到『不與漢化』，在事實上却有點不然了，苗人非但早已開始漢化，並且還以為無上的光榮。在趕場——市集的時候，貴州的每一個城鎭裏，我們都可以遇到不少苗人，然而，祗要是會說渶話，他便絕對不肯輕曾向你承認　是苗人。「你很苗」，「你很土」，這中句差不多可算是貴州的特產，她的意思是說，「你這個人，太土裏土氣了，一點也不懂事，簡直像個苗人。」追究起這句話的根源，當然是由於以往漢人鄙視苗人而演變成功的。不過，在另一方面，却收到相反的效果。苗人旣知自己被鄙視，因此便努力漢化，畫量學習漢人的習慣，語言，想能做得和漢人一樣，故以往的鄙視苗人倒是促進苗人漢化的一個無形要案。這種情形，當然是不對的，並且多少也是過去的事情了。現在，貴州省當局非常注意這個問題，為了避免苗人多心起見，一切犯忌的字眼如『苗』『土』『夷』，…都盡量地不用，以免增加隔膜。在貴州，苗，漢像是一家中的兩個兄弟，有着同樣的權利和義務，故對於苗人的看法，須要新光眼　廢棄舊公式。</p>
<p>桂海　衡志上有幾句關于苗人生活習慣的話：『食必先祭，合抬之苗，以手搏食，穆然見三古之遺風為。』從這裏可以看出，苗人的生活，有個奮的特微，同時因此也就發生了許多問題：</p>
<p>苗人愛吃牛肉，然而又甚米信，覺得吃牛肉太多了，一定非常罪過，故黔南一部分苗民，竟以吃牛　為　罪的辦法，雖然這種　是從胃到腸而還未出肚鬥的那一段，可是從衛生上講起來，到底還是不甚適宜。</p>
<p>住的方法，也很須要改良，普通皆人畜雜居一起，樓上是床，樓下就是午　馬攔。加以貴州氣候潮溼，尤多瘴氣，故苗人中痢疾　疾者甚多。並且，他們病了之後，還不請醫生，而祗請一種叫做『苗老奶』的來『打煞』。『打然』的方式甚多，大概皆不外於把雞或其他的小動物，吊在樑上，然後砍其頭，據說這樣就可去邪治病，當然這是迷信的辦法。</p>
<p>講到穿，苗人是十分簡瑛的，女人不穿伽，祗穿裙。因為穿裙兩腿容易跨得開，便於爬山，走路，耕作。</p>
<p>並且苗女終生還祇穿兩套裙；一套　上山的，一套是「趕楊」的，質料皆為很牢固的土布。</p>
<p>苗人的婚烟頗為自由，每年春秋二季郊外的跳舞，更是男女選擇配偶的好機會。結婚後，新娘不住夫家，而依然住在母家，故第一個兒子往往非新郎的創作。</p>
<p>總括點講，苗人男女皆甚健康，能勞作，善墾荒，勤儉之風，尤值得我們學習。淸朝康熙，雍正時代，皆設廳以治苗，其初苗人長吏如官，畏官如神，對政府十分恭敬，因此一般官吏對於苗人作威作福，非常暴虐，而漢人移居於貴者，亦日見增加。三四十年間，苗人的居住區域幾盡被佔据。苗人忿怒，乃倡言逐客民而復故土，故因之有乾陸六十年之苗亂，後來消廷調集了四川，雲南，湖南，廣西等省的動十萬精兵，局勢方得平靜。到了傳鼎總理邊務的時候，乃一面加强武備，一面設立苗民學校，實行所謂『一半軍事，一半政治』的統治辦法，並劃貴州東南境以古州為中心的三千里土地為苗疆，以限制其活動的範圍圍……。這種傳統的　多少帶點帝國主義氣味的錯誤政策，現在已完全被遺棄了。（救亡社約）</p>

<p>在這個悽冷的車站上，寒冬的驟雨正落在露天的月台上。德皇成廉二世緩慢地步行下軍，面有愁容，兩手深深的挿在灰色外套的衣袋中，等待荷蘭政府的允准，通過以逹於安全地帶。</p>
<p>自從那年十一月起以至於現在，二十年的光陰已經逝去了。那個失敗而衰頽的人物，自從那年來荷蘭居住後，就一直非常平靜地生活到現在。他已逹八十遐齡，不論作為一個統治者有什麼缺點，他現在以怡靜的尊嚴過警放逐的生活，足使人寄予無限的同情。一九二〇年，德皇因不得巳而遜位，就卜居於哈斯杜恩（HansDoorn）的城堡中。</p>
<p>杜恩是一個隱蔽的村落，位處荷蘭中部，有居民七千人。偶然到那裏去游歷的，不會想　有這樣顯赫的一個放逐者居住看。每個孩子都知道這所「屋子」，其實把這所屋子稱作城堡，就是依照荷蘭的式樣，還是覺得太小。在路上就可以望見造成半圓形的大鬥。有一個便服的偵探，在門口詳細查問拜訪者，另外有一名憲兵在附近徘徊着。</p>
<p>拜訪者被引導到一間室中，驀面放有紅皮畫兩冊，一本上寫着一個W，一本上有一個H字樣，凡去觀見遜皇的，都要在手冊上題名。在那些題辭中有許多表示忠誠的頌詞，慰藉的箴言，和把自聖經的成語，拜訪者的手册每晚放在德皇左右，廢皇是非常詳細地閱讀的。</p>
<p>穿過花園。有一條買闊的道路，通達皇室，路旁是平整的草地，四周圍以年代久遠的業樹。房屋作莊　的荷蘭贵族式，兩府樓，紅磚牆上長滿着綠色滕蔓，襯着的是一塵不染的白色窗檻。穿過圓池，屋子前面的兩扇廣闊的玻璃前門敞開了，穿着黑制服的二名僕人鞠躬招待拜訪者入內。</p>
<p>在　上，第一樣東西觸入眼廉的是荷蘭總督及其夫人的盡像，這就是威廉二世對於渥萊琪，那蕯王Dynasty　of　Orange　Nassau　表示敬意的意思。廢皇與他們有深切的關係。他常是非常高與的承認這種關係，只要看他數年前在倫敦　星登宮中致送的禮物，皇帝總督威嚴第三的彫像就可知道。</p>
<p>桌上鋪了一張軍事地圖。中國是繼西班牙與阿比西尼亞而成為戰鬥的前哨，引起德皇深切的注意。有小旗挿在圖上，　明軍隊的位置。德皇是大戰時軍人中的唯一遺留者；使拜訪者最注目的乃是室中點綴了不少鮮花。</p>
<p>餐室在後面，園景一覽無遺。晚上在餐桌。的人是愉快而莊嚴的。「柏茲達」新宮中的磁噐就在這寫應用。但是如其以為德皇的晚餐是豐腴的，却是錯誤了，相反的，每樣東西鄰非常簡單。每犬食單之單純，恐怕在　多皇室中是無與倫比的。</p>
<p>在杜恩的家務管理是頗要用心的。某晚，德皇抱了一個小客人坐在他的膝上，問道：「現在，請你講給我們聽吧。我們晚上要吃些什麼東西呢？」</p>
<p>孩子說是，「鴨——子。」</p>
<p>德皇再說：「那末，這星期中的第二次吃些什麼……」但是廣房管理者表示食物在第一次晚餐時，就要用完了。</p>
<p>一隻非常小的抉梯通至第一層樓。客人們都沒給鮮花一束，領入半黑的故皇后奧格斯他維多利亞正寢的　子。拜訪者把花　在覆蓋棺木的白氈上面。</p>
<p>上面掛了一幅加斯洛地方的圖畫——作為對於先前光榮時代的囘憶，在她近憲的寫字　上，有五十多個各別的鏡架放普她子孫的照片。在寂寞的放逐生活中，她常坐在那裏，感到自己和那些留在別處的許多親愛的小輩們聚在一起了。她有許多鐘愛的子孫，家庭生活却是單純而融洩，即使在握權與光榮的時日，也是如此</p>
<p>隣近的　閩是非常幽　的，德皇的繼室漢明公主　在此間喝喝午後的香茗，這是英國的風俗，在杜恩却是非常審愼地運行警。漢明公主博識廣讀，批判典籍時很見智慧和眼光。她的思想和行動像一個近代婦人。在去年，她允許自己的長女和平民締婚，她非常坦白的承認愛好新德國的一切，而且個人也認得希特勒。</p>
<p>德皇是習慣地走來飮茶的，他以活潑的步武走到妻子房中，使人覺得非八十歲的老人所能做到，他穿的是深黑色的家中衣服，裏面歡喜穿白色的背心和綁腿套，現在他只戴幾只戒指，在領結上有一個很大的別針，紐扣洞上有小型的十字。</p>
<p>德皇有　蕭的白髪和非常籌憐地　好的鬍　，看來確是一個顯赫的人物。行動安詳又　麗。一豐敏銳的眼請顯示出老人的　鑠精神。</p>

<h3 id="c42">鹽田在新界　大嶼山下和青山都有鹽出產 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>說起來眞奇怪，『鹽』的新聞，在香港新聞裏很少發現。最近我們方見過一兩段新聞紀載，是『香港的食鹽從暹羅國運來！』</p>
<p>大概不祇我本人，有許多閱者都不會相信香港的食鹽是從暹羅運來的，因為香港是有自己的鹽陽，每天都有鹽出產，還有許多大鹽幼鹽運往別地推銷。</p>
<p>香港居民不食香港本地出產的鹽，反取給于暹羅來的，根據振興土貨的原理，似乎有些矛盾。現在讓我來介紹香港的土鹽吧！</p>
<p>香港的鹽田，有的在大嶼山下，有的在新界靑山，在大嶼山下的比較在靑山多一點，年來似乎有些不景氣，大嶼山的鹽田，類多荒蕪破敗不堪，生長了許多鹹水草了，這恐怕是香港人不食香港鹽的結果了。</p>
<p>昨日星期我曾往靑山參觀通一個鹽場，　場的主人很客氣的為我解釋造鹽經過，現在我把鹽場主人說給我的向閱者介紹一下，鹽是海水造成的，製造時了必用原料，旣無需原料，當然是無需本錢，唯一的原料是海水。還仗猛烈日光，經過數小時之晒曝，自然形成了大鹽，又所謂生鹽和粗鹽，大約『日曝』的時間，八個鐘頭便功德完滿，但在雨水天則造鹽不成，靠着造鹽食飯的人祇有「食穀種」了。</p>
<p>一塊鹽田，面積大小與禾田差不多，鹽田底平舖着麵粉似幼沙，沙面務要扒乎，若然一凹一凸，放入的海水未能平勻地停在田面，鹽之結晶就會受到影響。</p>
<p>海水長了，鹽場的人先把海水放進了一個蓄水池，經過了相當的時候，蓄水池內的水已濾淸了八九，于是把水池蓄永，放進鹽田內，鹽田是四週封固，水洩不通，田面積水三分至五分，便是足量，這三分五分的水量，經過八小時日光晒曝，便盡變了白鹽，很像薄薄的舖上了麵粉一般。收鹽的時候，用輕輕的手法，把監掃去，然後再把沙扒平，第二天到來，又照樣幹去，又得到第二天的收獲，總要場中人勤于工作，和日日都有陽光，每一塊鹽田，每一個頭，可得二十多塊錢的入息，比較種禾種什糧還有利呢。</p>
<p>香港鹽田的出產、根據鹽行中人說、一部份是銷入寶安和東江一帶，一都份則就近飲沽于新界居民、其錄則沽諸漁船的、靑山山下、更有三數家磨鹽的生意、把大生鹽粗鹽搬進小磨裏，剎那間把它變成細幼的食鹽、色澤也來得雪白和淸潔、鹽鹽舖的大主　。是出海的大漁船、　　漁船在出海之前，必　　　　　　　　　　　魚、　　　製，但是有少數的漁　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　利用內地價的高漲、　　　　　　　　　魚為名　　為實、麼鹽有此主顧客人、生意亦頗興隆、現在呢、因×艦意封鎖的關係、漁船販運私鹽、未敢條從前猖獗、磨鹽生、亦漸不如前了、</p>
<p>鹽是日常必需之品，香港居民人數現　一百五十萬，估計一日所需總在三萬斤左右，此筆巨資，安忍任其流入暹羅國裏。香港本身旣是鹽田，我們何不力侶土　，我們能維持到香港居民食香港鹽，則鹽場和其他直接間接將受到巨大的良好影響了！</p>

<p>— 史原</p>
<p>（本報特稿）東江的南戰場，是華南游擊區重要的一環，它擁有遼闊而富庶的東　兩縣、和廣九戲路的大部份，人曾經用很大的兵力向它作過數次殘酷的掃蕩，企圖打通廣九路的國際通道，但結果都是偷鷄不到去把米；所有陰謀完全失敗。</p>
<p>但是因為交通不便和漢奸的造謠，外面的人對於這個戰場的瞭解，多是不淸楚的，因此，我特在這裏向大家作個眞實的介紹：</p>
<p>（一）天然的游擊區『東莞的荔枝』我想許多人也早已聞名的了，什麼『掛綠呀』『三月紅呀』都是令人垂涎的珍品，我這次因為工作的關係得到機會來嘗試了三月紅的滋味，重看見那廣大的美麗菓園。不過今年的東莞荔枝比往年有點不同了，它不但是賣貴的食品，而且做了游擊隊的絕好掩護，因為對處都是濃密的菓園，以致×人的機械化部隊，不能發揮其效力，我們的部隊，則可借它的掩護運動自如，一時化零為整，給×人以重大的打擊，一時又化整為零，向四處的鄉村展開，使×人的飛機亦無從偵察和威脅我軍的行動，眞是一個天然的游擊區城。</p>
<p>（二）×人口中的『蚊軍』我軍在這方面的作戰，多數是利用夜間。這種戰衛曾經得到許多的收獲，尤其是上月十五那一晚的總攻擊更使×人喪胆：我們以兩連的兵力把石龍橋的×人步哨完全解决，並佔據了石龍車站，×軍在萬分惶恐的狀態之下，澈夜用大砲向四郊亂轟，其彈藥的消耗為石龍淪陷以來所僅有。</p>
<p>同一晚上，我軍在東莞城方面亦僅以一連的兵搗毀西鬥×人最堅固的防禦工事，殺進城內，後來雖因連絡不週，不能把耕城克服，但×人已潰不成軍，死傷了一百多人（總共三百人左右），小鋼砲亦給我們炸毀了三門，天明後即劾換防，調囘後方補充。</p>
<p>因為這樣，東莞和石龍的×人，一入夜間便呈恐怖狀態，寢不安蓆畏懼『蚊軍』之奇襲和突擊。</p>
<p>（三）偉大的民間武力東寶兩縣的民聞武力，比之東江各屬　强大得多，機關鎗，駁壳　，各鄉都有。只就東莞第×區××××兩鄉而論，便有十挺輕機槍和一百多枝駁壳　以及兩百枝的粵造步鎗，甚至迫擊砲都有其他土造　砲更不可勝數了。</p>

<p>……（本報專訊）繼足球季後而舉行的公開棒球聯賽、是夏天裏最堪欣賞的一種運動、</p>
<p>……昨天十時起、原定先後有兩幕戰事、（一）是西洋會對香港會、（二）是南華會對岷甸奴、秩序不錯、</p>
<p>……老天不予方便、上午連續下雨、累得球人們又上不得戰場、像前天一樣的被雨伯誤了好事、</p>
<p>……本届加入戰團的雖祇六隊、惟因採取雙循環制，須經大約四個月的競賽時間、方可全部完畢、望以後每逢戰期、天莫下雨、致阻誤球人們的活動、</p>
<p>……在過去幾屆、南華會曾中止派隊參加、其原因乃缺乏此種人村、到了本屆、因中日戰事關係、個中好手多集於香江、於是南華乃重張旗載、復派隊參加賽會、而且七週首次、出師卽打倒　洋會、　人印象甚佳</p>

<h3 id="c66">初學游泳者　幾種常見的錯誤 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒法魯</p>
<p>（三）口呼鼻吸</p>
<p>一般人在陸上的呼吸、大都是用慣口呼鼻吸的方法、初泳的人、因為習　成了自然、到了水裏、也沿用這個習慣、不過游泳時的呼吸方法、適和陸上的相反、倘把不它改換、簡直無從談游泳、泳游時因為要易於浮起和前進、頭部是不極易出水的、呼吸的時間、不過在一轉頭一昂首之間、在這短促的時間內、要完成吸氣的使命、大的口腔、自然比小的鼻孔來得便當、而且因為鼻孔的小、面上淋下的水、隨時可以顧着吸進的空氣直入肺部、發生　咳、所以吸氣必須用口、泳時因為頭部不常出水、呼氣不得不在水中、在水中張口呼氣、水勢必乘機侵入、排除水分、小的鼻孔、自然比大的口腔來得便當、而且在水中既有充裕的時間、呼氣也不必像吸氣那樣匆忙、用細小的鼻孔、已足够應、所以呼氣必須用鼻、這種調練、是游泳者最初步的訓練、也是初學游泳者首要之　、不可不注意的、</p>
<p>（四）不敢睜眼</p>
<p>初泳的人、遇到水侵入眼內時、覺得有一種澀辣難耐之苦况、老大不自然、因此在水中固然不肯睜眼、在水面也不願睜眼、但是、游泳的方向有沒有錯鋘、游　的目的地有無到達、以及水裏和水面有沒有障礙、不睜眼是無法辨別的、倘因水侵入眼內而連在水面也不敢睜眼、不但是極端錯誤、幷且是非常危險的事、不過在水面水流入眼內的難受、和在水裏水浸入眼內的難受、是同樣的、所以要養成睜眼的習慣、應當在水面和水裏都要練習、切不可在水面勉强睜一睜、到了水裏就馬上閉上、這樣的練習、睜眼的習慣、是不易養成的、</p>
<p>（五）手足亂動</p>
<p>游泳時手和足的動作、一則可以帮助身體上浮、一則可以使得身體前進、但是必須要動得合法、不然就不會有好結果的、醫如、要浮起、則手足踏的向下動作、必須較提手縮足的向前動作急速而有力、要前進、手划足打的向後動作、必須較伸手舉足的向前動作急速而有力、而行手足踏或手划足打的動作時、必須盡景增大手足和水接矚的面積增加抗力、行提手縮足、或伸手舉足的動作時、必須盡量縮小手足和水接觸的面積、减小抗力這時游泳的鐵則、但是、初泳的人、因為身體下　和不能前進、急遽的亂動手足、希望浮起和前進、因為動作急遽的關係他所做的動作，適和正當的方法背道而馳、結果入格外快一點、進得格外慢一點、所以初泳的人，手足沒有會合法的動時、遇到危險、寗可不動、還可以借水的浮力上浮、否則、反可以遭致不幸的結果、</p>
<p>（六）抹臉拭水</p>
<p>初泳的人、往往在面上淋滿了水的時候、頻　的用手來抹拭、這種動作、雖沒有甚麼危險、但足以影響游泳的技術、因為抹拭的動作、　你　得怎樣快、多少終要一些時間、游泳者的手、主要使命就是使身體前進、倘舍集了主要的使命而旁及其他，前進的效率一定减少、這是很明顯的事實、而准究這種動作造成的原因、實與口呼鼻吸、和不敢睜眼有着連帶關係、因為水在面上、會淋進眼內、也會吸進鼻孔、眼睛不好睜、肺部會侵水、把它拭乾了、自然睜眼便利、呼吸暢快、所以要免除這一個不良的習慣必須要從改正呼吸和睜眼的錯誤入乎、倘呼吸無須昻頭、水裏水外都能睜眼、這種無謂的動作、不改自去了、（完）</p>

<p>滬市畸形繁榮未能過份樂觀　開發西南經濟端賴交通建設　—上海銀行之年會報告—</p>
<p>油類銳減　出口减少最劇者、為油一項、减五千三百錄萬元、較上年度减七千三百餘萬元、乃因桐油出口、自上年度之八千九百餘萬元、跌至本年度之三千九百餘萬元、則受內地交通梗阻之、響、至出口數量、依次以紡織織維類、畜產類、礦產類、紗綫類、油臘類、及茶類為大宗、</p>
<p>日居首位　以國別言本年度進口　方面、以日本佔首位、自上年度之一五〇、四百萬元、增至本年度之二〇九、八百萬元、次為美國、則自上年度之一八八、八八、八百萬元、降至一五一、二百萬元、又次為德國、英國、及荷屬東印度、均較上年度减少出口貨方面、以香港佔首位、自上年度之一六二、九百萬元增至二四三、三百萬元、次為日本自七年度之八四、三百萬元、增至一一六、五百萬元、又次為美國、英國、德國等、亦較上年度為减、</p>
<p>上海易貿　上海易貿又以埠別言、上海向佔全國進出口貿易半數以上本年度自上年度之九一三百萬元、至减四九一百萬元、而其他各埠、則自上年度之八七八百萬元、增至一、一五七百萬元、上海貿易、僅佔全貿易額三分之一弱、蓋一埠貿易、必須具有廣大易達之腹地、以資挹注、今上海所得為腹地之長江流城、既已淪為職區、百業停頓、兼以交通梗阻、貨運不易、易於减退、殆屬不可避免、凡此均為此次戰事之影響、堪為吾人所注意、</p>
<p>國內貿易　又國內貿易、亦因動事蔓延感受嚴重影響、住昔國內各貨物之運銷、以上海、漢口、天津、廣州、為重要聚散區、本年度長江航路、依然阻斷、戰區貨物因不易裝運、卽內地與上海及沿海各埠貿易、亦須繞這華南、改由粵漢綫運至長沙、漢口、等處、自漢口、廣州、失陷後、或取道海防、循　越鐵路以至昆明、或取道廣州灣循公路以至廣西、更或取道溫州、寧波、循浙贛矓路以至西南台省、運輸益感梗阻、因此內地所需之製成品、及沿海產品、均供不應求、價格日昂、而內地供給上海之生產原料與糧食、如棉花及小麥、亦無從裝運、上海廠家遂不得不仰給外棉外麥、如戰事延長、則內地之經濟機構、因國內貿易之停頓、或有趨於自足自給之可能也、</p>
<p>物價　本年度各地物價因貨物供需、缺其協調、變動甚劇、大率趨於上漲、推其主因、多由於生產停頓或運輸困難、需要並未增加、面供給業已大减、故雖通貨數量、並未大量增加、而各貨　格，仍多絡續上漲、就上海而言、物價總指數、自上度十二月之一三四·三（以一九二九年為一〇〇）漲至本年度十二月之一五九·四、約漲百分之十八、內除糧食外、其他商品、多漲伯頗鉅、有如下列變動、而各堆細食價格、則始終非常穩定、除一二避難人民　增之城市外、並無激漲之風、緣去年狄收豐順、供給堪稱充足、內地治安秩序、藉此得以維持、有補於戰時經濟者、實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>商業　本年度各地工商業、因所受戰專影響之不同、其變動亦逈然有異、就上海而言、除華界衆已被燬、及虹口、楊樹浦迄未開放外、凡租界以內之工商業、無不呈畸形之繁榮、獲利之厚、為歷年所僅見、推其原因、厭有數端、</p>
<h3 id="c68">避難人口增加 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>資金亦隨之流入、各種消費事業、頓受刺激、如百貨業娛樂業、飲食業、及交涌業等、其營業額及牧益、均有顯著之增加、而因人口密集關係、住居發生問題，房租日昂、久不景氣之地產業、亦頓趨活團、惟尚限於小地產之交易、以供住居及設廠之用、</p>
<h3 id="c69">外匯黑市成立 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>後、匯個减縮、於是進口商之積有存貨者、均獲利倍蓗、如五金業、西藥業、呢絨業等、雖在戰時蒙有極大損失者、亦輒能抵補有餘、出口商則因匯有有利、其貨物亦得善價而沽、如歷年不景氣之絲　業、本年度因貨價激漲、頓呈復興　象、</p>
<h3 id="c70">貨物出產激減 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>形成供不敷求之現象，如棉紡業因內地紗廠完全停頓，所需棉紗，均須仰給上海，而上海開工紗廠、亦僅限於租界安全區內，以致需要　過其供給，紗價遂扶搖直上，每句獲利，輒達百元，年終盈餘，均頗豐厚，其他如棉織業，絲織業，鐵工業，搪瓷業，火柴業等。亦具有同樣現象，故戰後小規模新工廠之設立，極為踴躍</p>
<h3 id="c71">產區運輸阻滯 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>致貨物來源稀少，存貨者遂　斷居奇，如棉花業。乾繭業，生牛皮業等，貨物來源短缺，價格絡續上升，擁有大量存貨者，坐獲厚利，集此諸因，遂告成今日上海之畸形繁榮，誠為戰時經濟之特殊現象，惟此等原因，多屬暫時性質。消費者旣不能永久消費，生產者亦不能操縱供給，況腹地，淪陷愈廣，市場愈感狭隘，故上海今後之經濟前途，殊不能過分樂觀。</p>
<h3 id="c72">內地之工商業 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>至內地工商業淪陷於戰區者，織在停頓之中，其　失浩大，無從估計，至在西南各省，則工業方面，自淪陷區遷移之工廠，初由京滬一帶集中漢口，繼與武漢諸廠絡續移入西南，雖運輸困難萬狀，卒能達到目的地，已頗有開工製造者，其精神殊堪欽許，商業方面，在大都市如重慶，成都，昆明等處，因人口增加，表織上亦是景氣現象，雖人民常處於空襲之威脅中，各業仍有進展，惟以運輸困難，日用必需品，常感缺乏，而專供出口之土貨，反趨呆滯，故開發西南經濟，必以交通建設為要圖，目下政府正積極建築鐵路公路，並設置各種交通工具，則日後交通運輸，自必日趨便利，而西南經濟之開發、亦易於從事矣、綜上所述、可知國內經濟環境、巳因戰事關係、發生重大轉變。</p>
<p>觀察上表、糧食方面、尚少漲價情事、故上海之生活費指數、反自上年十二月之一五八、五四、降為本年十二月之一五四、九三、較之八一三以前之一月、則已升漲百分之四一强、惟此項生活指數、係指上海工人之生活而言、若普通新水階級人士、消費中食品所佔成份、較工人為少、則其指數自必較去年十二月為增高、至內地物價關於製成品方面、亦升漲甚烈、重慶二十支棉紗價格、曾一度漲至每包一千元、此外日用必需品及奢侈品、如毛巾、牙刷、香烟、啤酒等、漲價一二倍、殆羈常事、惟依賴出口之土貨反因運輸之不便、而跌價求售、如桐油、五倍子、棉花等、在外埠離日見漲價、在產地則反減價脫售、其價格之差異、常至一倍以上、凡此均由於運輸困難、而費用昂貴、以致貨物之供需、失其協調、惟於此足為吾人欣慰者、卽大部份物價、雖有劇烈</p>

<p>— 季子</p>
<p>廣州淪陷前後，逃亡來港的知識靑年，一天多似一天，在這裏，生命是暫時的受不着威脅了，然而生活資源又有了問題，他們必須設法安排最起碼的生活農求，可是香港於他們就像一隻狹窄的範子，要翻身打滾，眞是天字弟一雞　，於是一條容易走，而又最後不容易走的路，橫在他們的面前了——那就是敎育。由於有口的人鄒會說話，換句話說，能說話的人都是可以『執鞭』了（？）在這道理下，無可如何的知識青年。祇有執命云敲打擊校之門，往教育的牛角尖　而已：也止為了受過敎育而又指說話的人太多了，多導象鄉間蒼蠅一樣，到處亂飛，究竟闣核的敎員容量有限，生話競爭日形劇烈，失業人多是意中事，沒有令人　異之處存在。不幸厠身失業隊伍的人，固然可悲，但登了教育「龍門」的人，究竟可喜到什麼程度，還有大大疑問在——日繼以夜講解解，講解到唇焦舌斃死而後已，而講解的內容，旣不盡台抗戰教育需求，又小盡合自己的願望，把一些脫節的敎材，向國家未來主人翁的腦袋，不顧死活的灌每天每夜，郡在幹着自己所憎恨的文化工作，由於敎育也是私人產業的制度存在，敎書匠對於校長的關係，可以和店主對於僱員的關係　不多，一个是文化商人，一个是供給文化的匠人，後者必須時時刻仰前者鼻息，留心自己的飯碗，因為解僱是太容易了，社會裏教育後備軍正充斥着，塡補是个必費心思的。吃大的講授，換來菲薄得不近人情的待遇，敎書的人始終是窮困的，疲乏的，就像沙模上任重致遠的駱駝，就像拖着犁耙的耕牛——這這牛要吃得特別少，特別賤，如水草之類，但工作要動快，要有無織量的負担，要把他的氣力，骨角皮肉，全部貢獻給主人，『執鞭之士』太苦了！</p>
<p>國內的淪陷區游擊區裏，有許多未開始未完成的任務，急切地需要大量知識青年去負担；古舊的農村，等待新青年的輸血，不願出賣靈魂的青年教師，放下你的鞭子吧！為了祖國，也為了自己的光明前途着想，在狹小的籠子裏喝幾杯淸水，唱幾首淸歌去娛樂別人是沒有前逾的。長久的耽誤，終有一天你會失去飛翔的能力。永還依賴別人的撫養是羞恥的；祖國的原野，祖國的天空是這樣無邊的廣大，在那兒海闊天空，逍遙自得，在那兒于萬個戰士需要你的敎育，千萬個爭自由的人們需要你的組織與動員，千萬個光榮受創的民埃英雄需要你的撫慰，千萬個願沛流離的犧牲者需要你的安排；把你嘹亮的歌聲，傳給不願做奴隸的人們吧！把你廣博的知職灌入廣大羣衆和戰士的　袋去吧！</p>
<p>在鬥爭的國土上，那兒沒有庸俗司慣的文化商人織孔，那兒織有人需要虛偽的標榜和恭維，那兒的敎育，那兒的一切全在配合抗戰進行，生活在那裏，你沒有　　的慨歡，那兒有的雖然是無限的艱難痛苦，然而也有無限的快慰歡忭</p>
<p>起來！靑年的敎師們，從今天開始就放下你的鞭子，肩起威武的槍桿，我祝你在　火中壯　起來！</p>
<h3 id="c74">兩件動人的事 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 曾兆筠</p>
<p>這個題目，是一位剛從前綫回來的同志帶給我的。</p>
<p>第一，是於是一個傳令兵的事情，在湖北省的一個戰場上，某傳令兵受到命令，帶一份機要文件給友軍，兩地的距離，約有十里路，橫亙中間的是×人的陣地。</p>
<p>他很快的跑，涉過沒脛的水；穿　深遠的林，心裏所想的只有用件事：第一是怎樣可于最速時間完成任務？第二是怎樣可避免×兵耳目？他邊跑邊想，但司恨的事情終于來臨了，一陣排槍的吼聲。擊署他的耳　，遠遠地跑來十多個×人，我們的傳令兵急忙伏下，負　勇抗，他的槍法旣高，戰略又好，兩三顆子彈結果了兩三個×人，其他的便被嚇住不敢前進。</p>
<p>第一個難關雖過，但第二個　礙又來了，走了一大半路，再次遭遇仇×，這一囘是更多了，有百多個！他們好像已經曉得傳令兵帶著一件很重要很重要的東西，所以四面包圍。一點兒也不放鬆的迫近，迫近，迫近！這位英勇的戰士知道已沒有衝出重圍的希望，因此他的腦海中，又湧出兩穩思想：第一，怎樣可以與「公文」織成灰　？第二，怎樣可以在最後一剎那間多殺幾個×人？</p>
<p>他很快的便决定了，從腰間解下手榴彈，把『公文到手榴彈上，自己站在旁邊，槍口對準×人，×兵一個，兩個的裁倒，但後　的終于園攏來了，最後關頭巳至，我們的傳令兵，向手榴彈打了一槍，『轟』！一聲震天的亮響，這最後的一下，殺死了自己，粉碎『公文』，同時也送掉五個×人的命。</p>
<p>一個外國新聞記者得了這個消息，很感動的說：『中國眞是偉大的中國，她產生了無數英勇的士兵，這種至上的精神，不但日本沒有，就是在世界各國的隊伍裏也是很難找的！』</p>
<p>第二件是關于一個傷兵的事。</p>
<p>一架綠色的乓車，從前線開到後方來，車廂裏面躺着十二個受了重傷的戰士，有的被砲火轟去了腿，有的腿和手鄒不見了。車的尾巴有一　進出的門。第二級扶梯上又坐着一個左臂受了傷的兵士，肩頭和手腕絡着一條客白的綳帶，滲透出鮮紅的血。他的　恪很龍大，寬闊關的肩膊擦着門的邊沿。阻住進出的路。一班戰地慰勞團和救傷隊，正急于進去把呻吟待救的兄弟拍出，但這位傷兵却不肯讓開，有的人上前向他解釋，一次，兩次，他都不理！一位十三歲的小朋友，便很誠　的走上去對他說：『老鄉，你受舊了！你走不動嗎？讓我來扶你好不好？』小孩子一邊說，一邊用小手去攙扶傷者，傷兵臉色一變，而眼　得　紅，放射出赤色的光，像要吃人的樣子。『劈拍！』『劈拍！』一連打了兩傭很　的耳光，這恐怕是這位小朋友從媽媽的肚裏鑽出來，第一次受到的最大的痛苦與侮辱吧？但他忍住了眼淚，笑容滿面的走上前，向傷兵深深地鞠一鞠躬，很和氣的說：『老鄉，我們干辛萬苦到這裏來，平想給你們帶來安慰與熱情的，難道我的舉動使你不愉快嗎！你看，你聽！車廂裏面還有許多奄奄一息的兄弟，我因為想救活他們再為祖國幼力，所以才開罪了你！好朋友，你也是受了傷，但你還有兩條腿可以走，他們恐怕連坐也不行了！老鄉，我向你陪罪，請你不要這樣打我，你要是這樣是令我很難過的。」這一者話，設得這位　兵哭起來，大哭起來！顫聲說：『大家請原諒我！我錯了！我是一個殺人不眨眼的魔君，當「鬍子」時一口氣砍下十五個皿淋淋的人頭也不流過一滴淚，但我這回却給一個小孩子感動，童子軍！」他熱情地執住孩子的小手說：「我很對不起你！」</p>
<p>記者道：「這位小朋友的偉大精神，是足以做我們成年人的榜樣的，我們要救國家，便先要向這們童子軍學習學習，這個小童軍正是民族的小英雄呵！」</p>
<h3 id="c75">連江口之夜 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 新丁</p>
<p>從韶關奔赴北江淸遠前綫，首先須　車（火車和公路車鄰有）到大坑口，然後從　裏轉搭小艇沿北江南下，自北而南，這是順水，大慨要一天半可以到黎明和橫石；如果自南而北，便要四五天才可以囘到大抗口。</p>
<p>這天早上六時從大坑口雇艇起行，卽午二時抵英德縣城，稍息，三時又復啓行，六時許便到了連江口，日已西斜，晚　遍佈。</p>
<p>連江口本來是一個很小的墟　，可是從大坑口南下的旅客倒了這裏，彷彿在帝王時代的府衛『文武官員，至此下馬』一樣，都得在此歇織一宵，第一天才能够繼續駛行。因此這个地方也漸漸地旺盛起米，可是目從花縣從化給×人侵佔了以後，打這裏經過的少數的是左近的鄉人，多半是負有任務的武裝同志。</p>
<p>和我同行的有兩位武裝同志，一位是第×師　兵指揮部的連長長，另一位也是第×帥部當步兵連長的，都是大坑口為了合伙　艇比較省費用而巧遇的臨時旅伴，當均兵連長的那一位個性沉默，少說話；司是另一位連長却愛談笑，性豪爽，滔滔不絕，减却旅途寂寞，當艇還沒有到連江口的時候，他就嚷着晚上到連江口的旅店住宿，要暢快的玩一番。</p>
<p>連江口的墟市傍着江邊，江邊的樓房許多都是用木蓋搭的，遠望像一些鴿子　，下面有高高的木柱支撑翁。在樓房的窗門上倚着一些塗脂抹粉領紐沒有扣好的艷裝女子，使人一望而知那是夜的『天使』——　女。當我們的小艇泊在碼頭的時候，天已快要黑下來了。我們望忙上岸找旅店，開了一個大房，便出來吃晚飯，這時，不是『萬家燈火』，而是一片黑漆漆的街市，高店多已翻了門，只有幾家食物館燃着特別光亮的汽燈，『天使』們在街頭，在食物館門前一帶躊躅着，在等待她們的主　。</p>
<p>原來她們都是唱南詞的歌妓，年紀多在十五，六歲左右，有兩三家門口的招牌寫着某某旅店，門前貼着一雙風樓一某　樓字樣的，便是她們的大本營，起初我們上岸時，不知就裏以為是普通旅店　上樓上一看，原來她們一大羣，嘰嘰咕嚕地在談談笑笑；我們才知道弄錯了，連忙跑下來。可是我們之中的某連長，卻戀戀不捨停在那裏左觀右望，下樓時還哈哈的大笑着，他說，『有趣得很啦，嘻嘻！』</p>
<p>到飯店吃過晚飯，某連長喝了兩杯燒酒，滿長着　密短髭的臉上，分外顯得紅潤，他說要去訪友，便獨自走了。我和砲兵連長囘到旅店，閒談着砲兵生活，不久各自睡了。</p>
<p>一天悶在小艇的生活，本來已很累的了，司是那裏能够睡得着呢？睡下不久便有防軍來查房，查過之後　隣房住客叫了一个南詢歌妓來，『打情罵俏』，胡調了半夜才下來，而那位去「訪友」的連長，却始終沒有囘來旅店。</p>
<p>第二天早上六時我們已起來了，候到七時許還不見他回來，我們都笑着論有點兒稀奇了，一定有故事出的，我們跑到大街上去吃粥，剛巧經過「雙風樓」，門口有人挑水進去，開門的是一個穿點花長衫的南　歌女睡眼迷矇，還沒有整裝，我們試向樓上大聲喊：</p>
<p>『×連長！』果然立刻有囘聲自褸上發出：</p>
<p>「喂，在這裏！」</p>
<p>我們哈哈的大笑起來，×連長穿着底衣，打開樓上的窗往下和我們打招呼，</p>
<p>「艇要開了，你不下來我們就先走了呀！」</p>
<p>『不，等等我吧，就來了！』他給我們恐嚇得焦急了。</p>
<p>我們先囘到艇裏，再候了一會，他才施施然來了，我們問：</p>
<p>『昨夜甜蜜否？』他笑着答：</p>
<p>『倒不錯呢！下次過這裏還要再來嘗一嘗。』</p>
<h3 id="c76">熱火燒了我的胸膛 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>

<p>— 林螢牕</p>
<p>這位科長是我經過××的時候，為了開展工作和辦手續等關係而去謁訪的一位，本來我們找的是縣長。後來知道這事情是科長兼理的，加以他是抗敵會宣傳工作團的團長。</p>
<p>當我們跑了三次的縣政府，才答覆我們：那里不是求見的場所，尤其是我們。後來這是　我們孩子拜謁的誠懇，才準在宣工團團長辦公室見我們！</p>
<p>宣工團里只有一個「團丁」在整　雜務。衷和華跟我三人從兩點等到四點。一份報紙已經　得爛破，才看見科長托着一根短手杖走來。個子並不高，面龐像大廟里的四大金剛一樣。筆挺的西裝。一坐下來總是拔着長在嘴下的幾根　　頭，顯得十分威武，似乎不這樣曾有擴他報他的尊貴。</p>
<p>『給你們等午好久吧』！他淡淡地。</p>
<p>『不曾的　只有兩點鐘』，衷刁皮地說。</p>
<p>『唔……你們那里來的』？我們的公園他似乎沒有理會到。</p>
<p>『我們從淪陷的家鄉——廈門來的』。我答。</p>
<p>『唔，原來是小難民隊』！他微有感慨地。</p>
<p>『可是，我們是要繼續幹救亡工作的。以所不願跟爸媽做難民，做小順民』！裏有點不服氣地。</p>
<p>『不過；你們靠誰生活呢』？他狠地拔一根鬌子</p>
<p>『唔；我們是用工作來給人家同情的。吃的靠各地腎明長官和親愛的同胞。我們一路都是睡在地下，穿草鞋，連七歲小同志也跑七八十里』！……</p>
<p>『這種生活不是很苦嗎』？他聽得不耐煩。</p>
<p>『不，我們的口號是耐勞克苦；在這大時代，不但要吃苦，還要找苦吃！』裏繼續解釋着。</p>
<p>『我看你們這樣年輕，還是回去跟爸媽在一起生活，好好地念書。』他有點憐憫地。</p>
<p>「誰願意囘去念奴隸的書？……但我們是知道抗戰後需要建國，也需要我們，所以我在流亡中總努力敎育自己！用互助互助，集體研究抗戰中的各種問題。」華表面是激昂，但內心有點臂火。</p>
<p>『還有研究，那麼共產你們一定知道的了。一他覺得　些孩子太進步的小傢伙，趕快發問，霎時，他急迫地問：『你們說：共產黨是個什麼東西？』</p>
<p>「唔，我們知道它是擁護抗戰努力殺×的一些人。」</p>
<p>「單紙這些？」他不放心地再沉着聲音：「眞的嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的我們知道的就只有這些」</p>
<p>「唔……」他沉吟一下：『我告訴你們：現在我們只有一個主義……三民主義。違背它就是破壞抗戰，也就是漢奸！所以你們要努力實行，曉得嗎？』</p>
<p>「科長所說是不會錯的。我們也知道三民主義最後目的是民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福。所以我們沿遂對於民衆和長官有什麼不合理的地方都根据這去討論，使大家五相諒解，互相合作！」</p>
<p>他覺得有點頭痛，隨向　上投望一下，雖然沒有壁鐘但他設：「時間到了，我還有公事！」費完他拿了手杖，連頭也不掉地去了。</p>

        <h1>1939.05.22</h1>
<h3 id="e1">On the So-Called "Sino-Soviet Secret Pact" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in European international affairs, alliances and agreements have become prevalent, with each party scheming and plotting for their own benefit. This trend shows no signs of abating. Its influence has even led some to believe that the Far East is following suit. For example, yesterday's and the day before's newspapers carried a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo stating that two Japanese newspapers published reports of a secret pact between China and the Soviet Union. One newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union would provide China with an unlimited number of aircraft pilots and mechanics. It would also extend a loan of 400 million yuan to China to purchase military supplies, and would jointly establish a Sino-Soviet arms import company with 50 million yuan. The other newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union demanded a price for its aid to China in resisting Japan. The matter was allegedly discussed by Sun Ke in Moscow, and the following points were reportedly approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: First, China must consult with Moscow before accepting mediation from any third country. Second, China should absolutely suppress pro-peace factions within the National Government and other jurisdictions. Third, China must equalize the equipment and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the armies of various provinces. Fourth, the three provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang should be designated as special administrative regions, with Mao Zedong as chairman, garrisoned solely by the Communist Army. The Soviet Union would be allowed to develop the resources of these three provinces and station a military officer as a military representative. Fifth, China should hire Soviet experts as military training officers to train soldiers and pilots. Sixth, land and air routes would be opened between Xi'an and Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua. In exchange, the Soviet Union would provide China with unlimited material and technical assistance.</p>
<p>Given the rapid pace of events, we have not yet heard any response from the Chinese and Soviet authorities. However, based on the reports, a preliminary analysis reveals that none of the claims align with truth or reason. From what we know and believe, since China launched its full-scale war of resistance, it has received sympathy and assistance from all countries except the aggressor, not just the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's extensive material and technical assistance to China has been ongoing for some time, not just recently. This assistance is based on morality and mutual trust, and is therefore unconditional and does not involve any secret pacts. The Soviet Union is abundant in military supplies but lacks gold and silver. China's expectations of the Soviet Union lie in the former, not the latter. Therefore, we have not heard of any discussions regarding the so-called loan. Moreover, why would the government need to establish a company when dealing directly with another government? An air route between Chongqing and Moscow was opened and publicly tested long ago. Why would it be necessary to demand it as a condition of a secret pact? All these points, in both fact and spirit, are superior to what the Japanese newspapers reported. They are more worthy of respect and beyond the ability of the Japanese newspapers to comprehend. As for the so-called hiring of experts, China has historically invited numerous foreign advisors. However, this is an action taken autonomously by the authorities and is not subject to the constraints of any international treaty. China is fighting to resist aggression and to win freedom. How could it willingly sacrifice the freedom to hire experts for the sake of a so-called secret pact? Furthermore, the claim that three provinces would be designated as special regions, with specific individuals in charge, specific armies garrisoning them, and specific countries enjoying exclusive rights, is the desire of aggressors and does not suit the Soviet Union. As for the alleged equalization of equipment and treatment for all armies, our military authorities have previously dismissed this as a divisive tactic. Equal treatment has been practiced for some time, but unequal equipment is a reality due to limitations. Moreover, since the start of the war of resistance, troops have been divided by sectors, and there is no distinction between the Central Army and the Communist Army. Equipment is gradually improved and supplemented according to what is feasible, and this does not vary by sector. All these points can be refuted not only by facts, allowing us to assert their falsehood, but also by reasoning, leading us to conclude that the Chinese and Soviet sides would never make them conditions of a secret pact. As for the claims that China cannot accept mediation from other countries without prior consultation with Moscow, and that it must absolutely suppress pro-peace factions, these statements seem to harbor resentment towards the Soviet Union and aim to falsely accuse the Chinese government of becoming communist, using it as material for fabricating an alleged secret pact.</p>
<p>In international relations, contradictions lead to interests, interests lead to friends and enemies, friends and enemies lead to either hostility and war, or the formation of alliances, the signing of agreements, or the conclusion of secret pacts. Each party acts according to its needs and takes what it deems appropriate. This is a common practice and a familiar approach, and there is nothing surprising about it. Moreover, while these methods and approaches inevitably have consequences, broadly speaking, it is more accurate to say that circumstances create treaties rather than treaties creating circumstances. For example, the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France was a product of their alignment, not the other way around. The same applies to the alliance between Germany and Italy. A Sino-Soviet alliance is not entirely impossible. After Britain and France guaranteed Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union felt somewhat less threatened in the West, which increased its incentive to be more proactive in the East. This means that the conditions for China and the Soviet Union to jointly become the main force for stabilizing the Far East are becoming increasingly ready. Therefore, if China and the Soviet Union (or a wider range of countries) adopt reasonable measures and demonstrate important developments in the near future, it should not be surprising. However, it must be based on reciprocity and the principles of equality and freedom, and certainly not on a secret pact as reported by the Japanese newspapers. This can be asserted with certainty.</p>
<h3 id="e2">On the National Political Council <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Xiyuan</p>
<p>The National Political Council was conceived during the War of Resistance and established on the anniversary of its outbreak. Its preparation and planning took place after the fall of Nanjing, when a small number of compromising and surrendering elements were spreading poison, while the military and civilians across the country and national leaders were adhering to the War of Resistance and persevering. At that time, all patriotic people actively demanded the establishment of a body representing public opinion and the implementation of democratic politics, so that the government could concentrate national strength, mobilize human and material resources, and persist in the War of Resistance to the end in order to win the final victory. As national leader Chiang Kai-shek said: "Previously, the general public had many criticisms of the War of Resistance, mostly believing that in the past we only carried out military mobilization, but did not mobilize the political power of the whole country to mobilize the people to participate in the War of Resistance" (speech at the opening ceremony of the first session of the National Political Council). In April of last year, the Kuomintang convened a temporary national representative assembly "because the national representative assembly cannot be convened immediately due to the current value of the invading army, and at the same time, in this extraordinary period, it is urgent to unite the strength of the whole country, pool ideas, and benefit the determination and implementation of national undertakings, it was resolved to organize a body representing public opinion, and the National Political Council will be convened after the National Political Council Organization Law is formulated". At the same time, the temporary assembly declaration also pointed out that "the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance depends not only on military strength, but also on the strength of the people, and the development of the strength of the people and the increase of civil rights are causally related, so organizing the people and training the people are necessary tasks for developing the strength of the people and also necessary conditions for increasing civil rights", and "autonomy emphasizes self-defense" and "freedom and unity take both into account" are the principles that must be guarded to develop the strength of the people and increase civil rights. This decision of the Kuomintang was indeed able to conform to public opinion and was indeed a preliminary and concrete method to remedy the shortcoming that political mobilization lagged behind military mobilization in the past.</p>
<p>Following the decision of the Temporary National Congress, the National Government promulgated fifteen articles of the National Political Council Organization Regulations on April 12 of last year. According to the provisions of the regulations, the nature of the National Political Council is, on the one hand, an organ for pooling ideas and soliciting public opinion, that is, an organ for government consultation (as stipulated in Article 1 of the regulations "The National Government establishes the National Political Council specifically for the purpose of pooling ideas and uniting the strength of the whole country during the War of Resistance"), and on the other hand, it also has the powers of resolution, suggestion, and consultation that are common to parliaments in ordinary constitutional countries, so it is also a considerable body representing public opinion (as in Article 5 "During the War of Resistance, the government shall submit important internal and external administrative policies to the National Political Council for resolution before implementation", Article 6 "The National Political Council may submit proposals to the government" and Article 7 "The National Political Council has the right to listen to the government's policy reports and to inquire to the government"). In this way, in terms of nature, although it is not yet a true body representing public opinion, it already has the function of a considerable body representing public opinion. Secondly, in terms of the method of production, although the national political councilors are produced by election and appointment rather than directly elected by the people, the 200 councilors selected and appointed by the government include a wide range of provinces and cities, parties, nationalities, all walks of life, and overseas Chinese, and therefore they can also reflect public opinion to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>"The most important significance and purpose of the establishment of the National Political Council is to concentrate the strength of the entire nation to fight to the death against the forces of aggression in order to achieve victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction" (Chiang Kai-shek). Therefore, the organization of the National Political Council has important significance in the history of China's political development. The first session was convened in Hankou on July 6 last year, at a time when the withdrawal from Xuzhou and the crisis in Wuhan were taking place, so the people of the whole country held a unified attitude of support for the establishment of the National Political Council, which was a considerable body representing public opinion during the war, and put forward many opinions on the first meeting for the councilors to put forward the first meeting in order to provide the government with adoption and implementation. At that time, the most central issues were: how to persist in the War of Resistance and strive for the final victory, how to specifically carry out the defense of Wuhan and strive for the victory of the third phase of the War of Resistance, and how to consolidate and expand the national united front and promote the development of democratic politics. The resolutions of the first meeting generally reached resolutions that conformed to public opinion, which was reflected in the post-recess language and many important resolutions, such as determining the national policy of "fighting the War of Resistance to the end and striving for the final victory of the country and nation", such as announcing the policy of "a united front of the anti-Japanese nation with cooperation between all parties and factions"; such as passing the "Supporting the Outline of War of Resistance and National Construction", "Improving Administrative Institutions at All Levels", "Establishing Provincial and County Political Councils", "Implementing Democratic Politics", "Improving People's Livelihood during the War of Resistance" and other proposals.</p>
<p>The first session of the General Assembly closed on July 15 last year, and then adjourned. The second session of the General Assembly was reconvened in Chongqing on October 28 last year. The convocation of this meeting came after the national army withdrew from Guangzhou and Wuhan. Undoubtedly, China's War of Resistance had entered a more arduous stage. On the one hand, the × people and traitors were taking advantage of this opportunity to spread rumors, saying that China would definitely split and embark on the road of compromise and surrender at this time. At the same time, the pro-Japanese peace faction and defeatists were spreading a pessimistic and hopeless atmosphere, and in fact, they were helping the × people to gain momentum. The second session of the National Political Council was held at such a serious juncture, and naturally aroused close attention from the people of the whole country and international friends. This meeting, aimed at the serious situation at the time, resolutely cracked down on the pro-Japanese peace faction and the defeatists' attempt to compromise and surrender to the ×, and smashed the Japanese Fascist ××'s poison scheme of spreading rumors, slandering, and sowing discord, and enthusiastically embraced the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek and his declaration of adhering to the War of Resistance and never surrendering: On this point, from the General Assembly, Chen Shao Yu and other 73 councilors proposed "Supporting Chairman Chiang and the National Government to Intensify National Unity to Persist in Sustained Resistance Case", Councilors Zhang Yiying and other 41 politicians proposed "For the War of Resistance to the End, the Government Should Be Ordered to Promulgate a Decree to Prevent Anti-Minyan to Determine the Public Opinion Case", Councilor Chen Jia Geng and other 21 people proposed "No Peace Talks Before the Japanese × Has Withdrawn from My Individual Territory Case", Councilor Wang Zao Shi and other 66 people proposed "The Political Council Should Issue a Declaration to Embrace Chairman Chiang's Book to the People to Call on the Whole Country to Unite and Rise Up to Continue the War of Resistance Case". It was unanimously passed that the following resolution: "Embracing Chairman Chiang's declared policy of full-scale resistance and sustained resistance to strive for the initiative, in the future, the people of the whole country should resolutely resist the war under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, never surrender, abide by the rules, and complete the task of resisting the war and building the country", which was expressed most clearly. However, when this resolution was passed, it was not without great controversy. Wang ×× and his few wings, who had lost confidence in the future of the War of Resistance and belittled the national strength, even tried to stir up a discussion of peace and war inside and outside the meeting. At that time, Wang ×× not only openly protected and praised the pro-peace Zeng Lun of individual councilors, trying to dispel the proposal of Councilors Chen Jia Geng and others that "all civil servants who dare to talk about peace before ×× has returned the homeland should be regarded as traitors and traitors to the country"; but also publicly defended the councilors who did not pay to express their support for Chairman Chiang and the declaration of resisting the war to the end, and insisted that Zhang Junli make a report on the proposal containing the content against Chairman Chiang at the Political Council, trying to use this to attack the authority of the leader of the resistance war, in order to shake people's hearts and influence national policy; he even made Tao Xisheng and others desperately oppose the proposal of Councilor Chen Shaoyu and others on "Overcoming Difficulties, Passing the Rooster Pass, Persisting in the War of Resistance, and Striving for Victory", trying to use this to break the solidarity of ××××××; However, due to the efforts and struggles of the people of the whole country and the majority of councilors, the result of finally exposing and winning the conspiracy of Wang ×× to undermine the resistance and destroy unity was that ×× not only failed to use the National Political Council as a tool for surrendering to ×, but also exposed his conspiracy to seek peace with ×, which was a major gain of the second session of the National Political Council.</p>
<p>Secondly, the General Assembly also passed the "Please Abolish the Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Method to Fully Reflect Yu Lun and Freedom of Publication Case" proposed by Councilor Zou Taofen and other 74 people, indicating that the councilors are doing their best to promote democratic politics and protect civil rights and freedoms. Finally, the General Assembly also passed the "Improving the Conscription Implementation Law" proposed by Liang Shuming, Li Yuanding, Wang Yaming, Shi Liang and others, the "Strictly Punishing Traitors and Puppets Case" proposed by Lin Zuhan and other 21 people, the "Strengthening National Diplomacy Case" proposed by Wu Yuzhang and other 32 people, the "Vocational Education Implementation Plan" proposed by Jiang Hengyuan and other 21 people, and more than 20 other cases, which are all suggestions for concrete methods to persist in the War of Resistance and strive for victory, and propose practical solutions to the current difficulties.</p>
<p>The success of this conference is not only reflected in the resolutions passed, not only in the enthusiastic debate and sincere unity when discussing and passing the proposals, and not only in the active, responsible suggestions and questions of the councilors and the sincere answers of the heads of various departments and ministries of the government: but also in the fact that most of the councilors abandoned their prejudices and respected each other's personalities when discussing the issues. Although there were heated debates, there were few meaningless disputes. Debate is necessary, it can make the issues clearer, and it can make different opinions tend to be consistent. The vast majority of councilors can adhere to the principle of "no compromise on basic national policies, and specific issues can be discussed", which is the main reason for the success of the conference.</p>
<p>However, there are also shortcomings in the work of this Political Council, the most important of which is the lack of prior preparation. Before the meeting, not only were no proposals submitted to the Political Council, but also no consideration was given to how to enable the councilors to have the opportunity to understand and study the issues in advance after traveling thousands of miles, so that, as in the previous conference, the councilors only began to receive certain materials after entering the Political Council meeting venue and beginning to work, and it was difficult to study them seriously. In the reports of various ministries and committees, in the schedule of meetings, and in the study of proposals, there was a lack of prior preparation. The second is that there is not enough discussion on specific methods. This meeting has more than 80 proposals, which is much less than the more than 100 proposals in the previous meeting, but it has not been able to concentrate several specific and substantive proposals for detailed discussion, so the effect is limited.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after the end of the second Political Council, some of the councilors were able to go to the front line to inspect the war situation, comfort the troops, and go to the rear to investigate the people's feelings and help the government promote various tasks, which is very commendable.</p>
<p>After more than three months of recess, the third session of the National Political Council was convened again in Chongqing on February 12 of this year. From the second session to the third session, although there was only a little more than three months of time, China, in the War of Resistance, has experienced major tests and progress. The main characteristics of the third session that were different from the previous two sessions are:</p>
<p>First, this conference was held after ××××××, during which time, domestic unity, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the anti-Japanese national united front, and the relationship between the various anti-Japanese parties have made some progress;</p>
<p>Second, after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, although peace and compromise temporarily surfaced, under the strong leadership of Chairman Chiang and the pressure of the frontline soldiers and the people of the whole country insisting on resisting the war to the end, it has temporarily disappeared, and after ×××××××××, the national policy of insisting on resisting the war to the end has been consolidated;</p>
<p>Third, Wang ××, who surrendered to × and sought peace, has been relieved of his post as speaker, which will enable the discussions at this Political Council to reach more united and consistent opinions on the basic national policies of adhering to the War of Resistance and diplomatic policies;</p>
<p>Fourth, Chairman Chiang personally served as the speaker, which will enable the opinions of the Political Council that are beneficial to the War of Resistance facilities to be more quickly reflected to the government and military authorities, so as to reduce the drawbacks of the resolutions of the Political Council in the past being delayed and unable to be realized quickly.</p>
<p>The third session of the General Assembly, in the enthusiastic atmosphere of the whole country unanimously and resolutely cracking down on the near guard's attempt to induce surrender and ××'s absurd act of begging for peace, made the entire body of the Political Council more resolutely and closely united around the national policy of the War of Resistance, and passed the resolution supporting the government's national policy: "Solemnly resolve that the established policy of the War of Resistance must be supported to the end", and called on the people of the whole country to "strengthen their confidence, align their steps, be of one heart and one mind, and go through to the end, in order to restore the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and administration, and complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the country". The resolute tone of this resolution, especially the solemn enthusiasm and unanimity when passing the resolution, strongly demonstrated the iron will of our people of the whole country to resist the war unyieldingly and persist to the end, reflecting the major progress between the two sessions - the progress of "turning danger into safety".</p>
<p>The importance and progress of the third session of the General Assembly lies not only in the fact that it passed a resolution supporting the national policy, but also in the fact that it deliberated on the plan to implement the national policy, that is, the various administrative plans for the second phase of the war proposed by the government. Although this plan is only an outline and lacks specific figures and progress, it is still a major manifestation of the progress in the second phase of the War of Resistance. In order to win the victory of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we need a plan with the coordination and connection of all aspects and the military first and victory first as the basis, and this plan has seen its beginning in the third session of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The General Assembly, on the basis of the important principle that politics is more important than military affairs, passed many resolutions aimed at striving for continuous progress in politics. Such as "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People, Giving Play to the People's Spirit to Benefit the War of Resistance Case" proposed by Councilor Dong Biwu: "Please the Government to Implement Awakening the Virtuous and the Able to Clarify Official Governance Case" proposed by Councilor Luo Wengan and others; "Intending to ask the Government to be Careful in the Selection of County Magistrates and to Improve Treatment to Determine the Term of Office to Strictly Supervise and Amend County Administration to Benefit the War of Resistance and National Construction Case" proposed by Councilor Li Yuanding and others, are all concrete proposals on improving politics. "Please Establish a Democratic Rule of Law System to Lay the Foundation for National Construction Case" proposed by Councilor Zhou Lan and others. Because this so-called case solemnly pointed out that "the principle that our country's politics should be based on democracy and the rule of law to complete national construction is also well known to the people of the country. At this time when the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly beneficial and national construction is beginning, we should sharpen the spirit of democracy and the rule of law and establish a system of democracy and the rule of law, so as to train and achieve substantial achievements as early as possible and establish a solid foundation for the political intentions".</p>
<p>The General Assembly has made even greater progress in cultivating new forces and building military forces by passing important resolutions such as the Case of Accelerating the Expansion of Air Force Construction proposed by Councilor Huang Jianzhong and others, as well as improving conscription implementation and strengthening work behind enemy lines. In terms of economic construction, cultural construction, and education, it has also made major contributions, especially for the construction of Sichuan and Kang, the General Assembly passed the organization of the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association and the inspection group, which will have a major impetus to the construction of our rear area of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Looking at the experience of the National Political Council's three General Assemblies, it has indeed passed a lot of proposals on the national policies and various policies during the War of Resistance, but after these proposals are passed, how many of the government's actions are adopted, how many are implemented, and the specific situation cannot be known. After the "Case of Substantially Protecting the People's Rights" proposed by Councilor Shen Junru and others at the first General Assembly and the "Case of Protecting Freedom of Speech and Publication" proposed by Councilor Zou Taofen and others at the second General Assembly were passed, the government must refer to the resolutions of the Political Council to make the plan concrete and practical in the future, and on the other hand, it must implement the plan strictly. Only implementation can make the plan have true value and effect.</p>
<p>The reason why the Political Council can become a considerable body representing public opinion during the war and can gain the considerable trust of the people is that the work of the Political Council in the past six months since its establishment, due to the efforts of the councilors and the supervision of national opinion and the people of the whole country, can indeed reflect public opinion to a considerable extent, as Chairman Chiang said at this session of the Political Council: "The purpose of convening the National Political Council is to concentrate the strength of the whole country to eliminate the unprecedented national crisis and gather the will of the whole country to establish the foundation for national construction". Moreover, the people of the whole country are more eager to be able to pass through this transitional method of a wartime body representing public opinion to achieve true democratic politics. The responsibility of the Political Council is not only to be able to constantly reflect the opinions of the people to the government, but also to assist the government to gradually promote democratic politics, so that public opinion can be promoted and politics can become more progressive, as Chairman Chiang said: "What I sincerely hope from all councilors is that everyone should first establish mutual trust and common trust, and that everything should be open and honest, and that we should create a harmonious and friendly atmosphere like brothers and feet, that there is nothing that cannot be said directly, and that there is nothing that cannot be understood together. On the one hand, we must weigh the collection of public opinion. We must truly represent public opinion and fully promote public opinion; we must know everything and say everything, so that there is complete mutual understanding, harmony, and thoroughness between the government and society, without the slightest hindrance."</p>
<p>In order for the National Political Council to complete such a task, not only do all councilors need to work harder, but also the people of the whole country need to work together and supervise. As Chairman Chiang said in his closing remarks: "The historical mission of this Council is to lay the foundation for democratic politics, especially to lay the foundation for permanent and true democratic politics", "The people of a country, if they cannot be concerned about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a strong country."</p>
<p>China is beginning to move towards the path of democratic politics, which is the need of the War of Resistance. In this regard, although our achievements are not yet great, we will be able to continue to progress under the joint efforts of the whole country. We certainly cannot say that a transitional body representing public opinion does not have its drawbacks, but in general, the work of the past few sessions of the General Assembly has shown its considerable effect on the reform of politics and the promotion of the War of Resistance. When objective circumstances allow it to have progressive development, its effect can still be expanded and enriched. The direction of future efforts lies in strengthening the development of this body representing public opinion, and gradually transforming the current National Political Council and the councils that are being prepared in various provinces into bodies that truly represent public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Economic Plunder of China by Japan in North China <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Jinxi Dispatch) The fall of North China has been over a year now. What exactly have the Japanese warlords seized? This question is what every patriotic Chinese comrade is eager to know. Indeed, in the current stage of our prolonged war of resistance, the power supporting both sides of our war has gone beyond the scope of military and political aspects and has entered the realm of whether or not there is economic combat capability. The reason why the Japanese warlords have tried to end the war nine times and avoid prolonged combat as much as possible is precisely because they lack economic combat capability. At the same time, if the war inevitably continues, the Japanese will inevitably seek a solution to the panic of economic problems in China. Therefore, a part of China's vast resources has subsidized the enemy. What a huge natural loss this is!</p>
<p>Here, we must determine the basic strategy of the war of resistance. We must expand the scope of the struggle, not only attacking the enemy's offensive politically and militarily, but also destroying the foundation of the enemy's economic aggression. In our economic construction during the war of resistance, on the one hand, we must build a solid national defense economy, and on the other hand, we must support private economic activities as much as possible. In addition, we must effectively destroy the enemy's economic plans! This is the three-part movement of economic construction in our war of resistance. One part is missing, and it cannot support the prolonged war of resistance. Therefore, we cannot ignore the enemy's economic plans. We must deeply understand the essence of the enemy's various conspiracies in order to plan effective countermeasures. This is our motivation for collecting the enemy's economic construction data.</p>
<p>I. The Enemy's "Seizure Agencies"</p>
<p>1. Pseudo Sino-Japanese Economic Agreement Council:</p>
<p>The enemy's "seizure agencies" for carrying out economic conspiracies were organized one after another after the establishment of the puppet government. In March of last year, the Japanese Terauchi Hisaichi and the traitor Wang Kemin signed an agreement to establish the "Sino-Japanese Economic Agreement Council," composed of five members from the enemy and the puppet government, with the traitor Wang Kemin as the chairman, deciding to take "the comprehensive development of industrial resources in North China" as the main task.</p>
<p>2. Pseudo China United Reserve Bank</p>
<p>In the financial aspect, the pseudo China United Reserve Bank is the enemy's main "seizure agency." The puppet government announced the bank regulations in February, appointing the traitor Shi Huang as the president, with a capital of 50 million yuan, serving as the central bank of North China and the only bank issuing banknotes. It was stipulated that the banknotes of the pseudo United Bank were the new legal tender, universally used, and all kinds of legal tender originally in circulation were prohibited from circulation after June 11.</p>
<p>3. Revision of Tariffs after Forcibly Taking Over Customs:</p>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet government, it forcibly took over the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao customs. After the end of the war in Shandong, it reopened the Qingdao customs and stipulated different regulations for the export and import of Japanese goods, national goods, and foreign goods. This method of the Japanese obviously contains the role of economic monopoly, so it is also one of the seizure agencies.</p>
<p>4. Pseudo North China Development Company</p>
<p>The pseudo Xingzhong Company was dissolved at the end of October last year with the establishment of the pseudo North China Development Company. All enterprises previously controlled by the Xingzhong Company were taken over by the North China Development Company. The original employees of the Xingzhong Company were also transferred to the Development Company, and the capital has now been increased to 350 million yuan.</p>
<p>II. What the Japanese Seize</p>
<p>1. Financial Aspect:</p>
<p>A. Issue Paper Money and Absorb Legal Tender as Much as Possible:</p>
<p>We deeply understand that the Japanese economic panic cannot but be compensated by the excessive issuance of paper money. The above-mentioned pseudo China United Reserve Bank is the only banknote issuing agency. At the end of last year, the amount of issuance had reached a huge 100 million yuan. Other pseudo Mengjiang banks also issued more than 30 million yuan. Although there are no accurate statistics for various industrial banks, the number is also not small. (To be continued)</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I read Mr. Yang Jingtong's article "Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines" published in your newspaper on March 27. It is completely inconsistent with the facts and is extremely insulting to the overseas Chinese and education colleagues on this island. I am very surprised. After investigation, the overseas Chinese education on this island is being improved under the efforts of this association, such as the discussion of the school system and curriculum, and the implementation of the wartime education plan. The facts are all there. Yang Jingtong is one of the directors of this association. If he has any opinions, he should make suggestions to this association. Instead, he disregards the facts and talks nonsense. His purpose is only to exaggerate the Hongguang School he runs and undermine this association's plan for improving overseas Chinese education. In order to rectify discipline, this association convened the sixth plenary meeting of the board of directors and questioned Yang Jingtong on the spot. Mr. Yang still argued sophistically, which aroused public anger. In addition to unanimously resolving to cancel Yang Jingtong's attendance qualifications, he also wrote a rebuttal. Now I am sending the rebuttal (text omitted, editor's note) and asking you to publish it in your newspaper to correct the public's perception, so that people at home and abroad can understand the true situation of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. Sincerely, to the editors of Shenbao, the Philippine Overseas Chinese Education Association, May 17, 1938.</p>

<p>Active Operations of Our Army in Hebei and Shandong; Intermittent Traffic on the Pinghan and Jinpu Lines</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] According to a dispatch from Tianjin, traffic on all lines in North China is in a state of intermittent disruption. Although the enemy on the Jinpu Railway has started full traffic, tickets to Pukou are sold in Tianjin, but no passengers inquire about them. Moreover, this through train cannot arrive at the station on time when traveling south from Tianjin. In recent days, the southbound train has sometimes been unable to reach Jinan, because the northern section of the track is sometimes destroyed. The opening hours of the Pinghan and Pinghuan railways have also been inaccurate recently. It is said that 52 bridges on the Tianjin-eastern section of the Beining Railway in the eastern Hebei area were once destroyed.</p>
<p>[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 11th] Since the 10th and 11th, our army has been attacking the enemy along the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines and destroying enemy traffic.

Finally, at 8:00 am on the 20th, they defeated the enemy and recovered Tumen, capturing many prisoners. The enemy in Heilongguan was shaken by the fact that the road to support was cut off by us, and they strictly guarded their strongholds to prevent our attacks. The enemy forces in Tu-Hei attempted to attack westward several times, but failed. Now that Tumen has been recovered by us and traffic is interrupted, it is not difficult to annihilate them. There have been contacts in the Jinxi Jinxiang Town area for days. Our army launched a large-scale counterattack on the night of the 19th.

<h3 id="e6">Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Enthusiastically Donate; Amount Reaches 10 Million Yuan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 20th] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have donated 10 million yuan. Overseas Chinese in this city have donated 4.5 million yuan, and overseas Chinese in other major cities in the Dutch East Indies have also donated generously, not lagging behind. The Batavia Xinbao, the largest newspaper run by overseas Chinese here, raised 1 million yuan in donations. The newspaper was fined and suspended for eight days due to misunderstandings with the local government. However, the editors of the newspaper took advantage of the suspension period to visit famous overseas Chinese everywhere to raise donations, and the results were remarkable. The overseas Chinese in Java are very enthusiastic about forming a front-line rescue team, and the amount of Chinese medicines they have shipped back is particularly large. Because the East Indies are originally famous for producing quinine and other medicines, the overseas Chinese here know that malaria is prevalent in the war zone in China, so they are stepping up the movement to donate medicines.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] TASS News Agency, Vladivostok, 21st. The Department of Literature of the Far Eastern Library of the National University of Vladivostok has the largest collection of Soviet literature, including a 500-volume Chinese medical encyclopedia, which is extremely valuable. It was compiled by hundreds of people over decades, and contains all the manuscripts or printed books that have been passed down for a thousand years about Chinese culture.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Recently, the Chinese International League of Nations Association sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Ai Wenno, and transferred it to the directors of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, requesting them to impose sanctions on Japan to uphold justice and maintain humanity.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 20th] Xie Xiaxun, a famous chess player, was ordered to go to various places in Southeast Asia last year to promote chess, and the result was extremely satisfactory.

The team members are divided into three batches. The first batch, the Selangor team and the Xingbo team, arrived in Kunming the day before yesterday. The second batch, the Penang China team, will arrive tomorrow night. The third batch, the Perak team and the Shi Da team, will also arrive in Yunnan within one day.</p>

<p>[Haitong News Agency, Changchun, 21st] Yesterday, Saturday, it was announced here that at 11:10 am on Friday, Soviet border guards fired shots at the Japanese garrison in Taiping Town (translation) south of Mishan on the eastern border of the puppet Manchuria. The puppet Manchurian government protested to the Soviet Union on Saturday, and the protest letter has been forwarded to Moscow by the Soviet Consul General in Harbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 21st] The Soviet Union's "Truth" published an editorial on the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on extending the current service period of the Navy. The editorial stated that the number of Soviet warships is increasing year by year, their technical equipment is constantly improving, and their combat power is increasing daily. The Baltic and Black Sea Fleets are developing, and their strength will be even stronger. A complete fleet has been created in the North Sea. As for the Pacific, Soviet warships are gathered in the port of Vladivostok, as stable as Mount Tai. During the civil war, the Red Navy soldiers fought against the enemy and showed amazing battle continuations. Their heroic names are known to all. The Soviet Red Navy strictly adheres to its combat tradition. Our country's heroic sailors are diligently learning double-handed techniques in preparation for the enemy's imminent battle. The Soviet Union is building fleets of deep sea and ocean warships. The extension of the naval service period is the most important means to guarantee the strengthening of the Soviet Union's national defense forces. Sailors are highly respected in our country, and the Soviet state has taken various practical methods to enable its sailors to perform the greatest possible service. Soviet sailors warmly welcome the government's decree on extending the service period, and grand exercises have been held on various warships, where touching speeches naturally expressing the Soviet patriotic sentiment have been made. In the not-too-distant future, the Soviet Navy will become the most powerful navy in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Yen Falls Again; Reason is Capital Flight; Enemy Unable to Rescue <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] News from Shanghai: The enemy currency is increasingly falling sharply here. In exchange shops, one enemy currency can only be exchanged for 98.3 cents of legal currency. This matter has caused extreme anxiety on the enemy's side. In addition to suppressing enemy officials and civilians from engaging in thrift, the enemy is also preventing large amounts of enemy currency from flowing into the south bank of the Suzhou River to support it. The Finance Officer of the Enemy Ministry of Finance stationed in Taiwan returned to China on the 20th to discuss rescue measures with the enemy authorities, attempting to rescue the situation. The Finance Affairs Commissioner of the East Asian Bureau of the Enemy Asian Development Agency stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Office of the Bank of Japan are working hard to cooperate and implement various rescue measures, but all measures are still ineffective, and the enemy's financial turmoil is becoming more obvious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Junqing, 21st] News from outside Shanghai: Foreign bankers here said that the depreciation of the yen is due to the fact that domestic purchases of foreign exchange in Japan are extremely restricted, so Japanese merchants have come to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange in large quantities, resulting in a large amount of yen flowing to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japan Will Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany and Italy; Discussed and Decided by the Five-Minister Conference; Attempt to Take Retaliatory Action Against Democratic Countries <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 20th] News from abroad: After a lengthy meeting, important Japanese cabinet members announced to the Japanese press today that "Japan's policy toward the European situation has been finally decided." The nature of the final decision has not yet been announced, but it is speculated by well-informed sources in Tokyo that it is related to the establishment of a direct alliance with the Axis powers. For several weeks, Germany and Italy have been stepping up pressure on Japan to join the alliance, but there have also been strong opponents within the Japanese government. Japanese military officials have never concealed their desire to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. It can be seen that Hiranuma and Arita may be powerful figures among the opponents. However, since the Gulangyu Incident and the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States bluntly refused to change the administrative structure of the Shanghai International Settlement, the military has been given an opportunity to promote its policies in an intangible way. It is said that the atmosphere in the meeting of important Japanese cabinet members was unusually tense, and it took two and a half hours of debate to resolve the final decision, which shows that the opinions were not consistent. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai spoke the most in the cabinet meeting. According to various interviews with Japanese newspapers, Arita suddenly turned from the front line of opposing the alliance to supporting it in recent days, while Navy Minister Yonai firmly opposed this alliance. However, before the official announcement of the content of its settled agreement, all criticisms are speculative, and it is not too early to avoid them. After the meeting, Hiranuma reported the progress of the meeting to the Emperor and informed other cabinet members who did not participate in the meeting. It is said that Arita will give a lecture to the Privy Council next Wednesday to clarify Japan's attitude towards various issues in the international situation at that time.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Yesterday, Saturday, the cabinet held a secret meeting to decide on the policy to be taken on the European situation. Although the Japanese newspapers did not publish its resolution at all, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the participants in this secret meeting were Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata. They unanimously decided to adopt a policy of responding to Europe. It is said that the Japanese government has resolved not to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but to adopt a neutral policy, but still to be favorable to the two countries during the outbreak of the war. However, this report is completely fictitious. According to political circles here, the Japanese government is still divided into two factions this year. The military advocates signing a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but the diplomatic circles and the party do not want to conclude a military alliance, resulting in a direct attack on the United States. Moreover, the military's organ newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote a commentary stating that various departments in Japan have requested that the Anti-Comintern Pact be expanded into a military alliance, but the only purpose of this alliance is to directly attack the Soviet Union, but it is useless now that the Sino-Japanese war is in progress, resulting in an attack on the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Minister notified the cabinet today that the navy and marines have been ordered to withdraw from the Gulangyu Incident in order to seek a peaceful solution. In summary, the procedure discussed at today's meeting of senior cabinet members was to decide whether to accept the invitation of the German-Italian Axis powers on strict principles, so that it would be better than having nothing to gain. The cabinet has approved the resolution of the meeting of senior cabinet members, and this matter will not require a meeting with the Emperor to resolve, because the consent of the Emperor had been obtained in advance. Yesterday's meeting also sought to eliminate different opinions on the progress of the cabinet. The Japanese Prime Minister spent the weekend at a villa near Yokohama. Konoe attended yesterday's cabinet meeting. Cabinet members hoped that this resolution could accelerate the resolution of the war in China, so as to avoid standing in opposition to the democratic countries.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Chongqing After the Bombing <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinsheng</p>
<p>The third of May was a day with ten thousand miles of clear sky, devoid of clouds. The mountain city of Chongqing was bathed in bright sunlight. Such clear weather is exceptionally rare in Sichuan, but the people of Sichuan did not welcome it!</p>
<p>At noon, the school bell rang twelve times. Suddenly, a piercing, hoarse sound tore through the air. Woo! Woo! Woo! Stimulated by this ominous sound, people scattered frantically toward both sides of the Yangtze River. For half an hour, the sharp, hoarse sound was like needles, plunging the entire mountain city into a midnight-like silence. Only the distant sound of heavy bombers, Hong, Hong, Hong, Hong, grew nearer and nearer. Then came the deafening explosions. Thirty-six enemy planes created a flesh-and-blood-splattering "May Third"!</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the enemy planes departed, but the fire blazed red across the entire mountain city. Daliangzi, Shenxiankou, Xia Xinfeng Street, Shaanxi Street, Chuqimen – the fires burned through everything, turning everything into ashes. Thousands of fire dragons writhed fiercely into the sky, crackling and hissing in unison. Magnificent buildings collapsed askew. Bricks and stones, shattered by the flames, flew in all directions. It was truly a fire of unprecedented scale! Caoping Street, which had been hit by heavy bombs but had not caught fire, was half-scorched earth. Zhicheng Alley and Bingzi Alley were completely gone. To the left of Caoping Street was a deep, gaping pit. Most tragically, at the passenger wharf in Chuqimen, when the air raid alarm sounded, the passengers, workers, and coolies all sought refuge on the cargo boats. The hateful enemy, seeing so many people, dropped a heavy bomb. Wooden planks, steel beams, and the arms, legs, flesh, and blood of over seven hundred people flew into the surging, rolling currents. Bodies tumbled in the waves, and heads bobbed in the river. The waters of the Yangtze were dyed red with blood. Over seven hundred people, those seven hundred-plus people, were churned into a mass of meat paste in the blood-red river, devoured by the waves. Over seven hundred people were instantly destroyed by the heinous Japanese enemy!</p>
<p>A similarly tragic and horrifying scene occurred on the banks of the Yangtze River, inside an air raid shelter. There were over three hundred people inside. The enemy dropped an incendiary bomb at the entrance of the shelter. The wind blew into the cave, filling it with the smell of sulfur. All three hundred people in the shelter were suffocated to death in their dreams. Infants in swaddling clothes swelled to twice their size, and black blood flowed from their ears and noses.</p>
<p>Refugees in the bombed area desperately tried to rescue their children and mothers. Mud figures dragged from the rubble, their hands and feet twitching before going still. The rescuers paused, gritted their teeth, and threw themselves into the inferno to perish together. The cries before death, and the stench of charred human flesh, made one want to die! Beneath the flaming torchlight and swirling clouds of smoke, our houses collapsed one after another, and the Ta Kung Pao newspaper office was also destroyed!</p>
<p>Qingping Association and Chuanyan Yili were also in the disaster area. Although they were not directly hit by bombs, two buildings were destroyed. The enemy treated these two places with forty-six-jin stones. The enemy planes not only carried stone bombs, but also dropped ten large packages of "New Moon Brand" cigarettes wrapped in soft red paper.</p>
<p>The blood-and-flesh-splattering "May Third" was the most shameful day the enemy gave us. On this day, the enemy incurred a blood debt of over three thousand lives to us!</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The stench of blood from "May Third" had not yet dried, and the enemy delivered an even greater blood debt to us on "May Fourth"! The enemy's intention was to destroy our new capital, Chongqing. Twenty-seven enemy planes flew towards us at eleven o'clock, twisting and turning, only passing our air defense outposts, arriving over Chongqing City at six o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy planes were originally arrayed in the shape of a "person." As they flew over the riverbank, they suddenly changed into a straight line, dropping bombs indiscriminately on the city. Instantly, fires erupted everywhere. Xinfeng Street, Shaanxi Street, Nandou, Xiufeng Street, West Fourth Street, the commercial district, Douyou Street, Ji Street, Taiyanggou, Baixiang Street, Daizi Street, Caoping Street, Shiban Slope... all turned into volcanoes. The magnificent buildings of the Hunter &amp; Company watch store and the China National Goods Company were slowly destroyed in the flames. The entire Guotai Grand Theater was burned to the ground. Over five hundred people in the neighboring air raid shelter did not escape – it was truly an unprecedented catastrophe!</p>
<p>In Tieban Street, the Central News Agency collapsed after being hit by a bomb. On the roadside was a heartbreaking, bloody picture: a woman with a child in a bamboo basket on her back, holding a child tightly by the right hand, and another child by the left hand. Her abdomen had been blown open by a bomb, and an unborn infant was lying in a pool of intestines. All five lay quietly in a pool of blood. I no longer believe this is the human world – even in hell, you couldn't find such a cruel scene!</p>
<p>Lianglukou and Tongyuanmen were high ground, a very steep road leading upwards. When the fire broke out, it was like a magnificent volcano. Thousands of houses were burned to the ground, not one left standing. The scale of the fire was imaginable.</p>
<p>The fire grew bigger and bigger, burning until one o'clock, then two o'clock, continuing through the night, until the next day. People rescuing along the streets flowed like water. Thousands of water dragons attacked the fire dragons, swirling into a mass. The screams of the wounded, the crackling of burning wood and stone, and the stench of human flesh made one unable to hear or see. Chongqing was entirely enveloped in red light. People's faces were drained of color, carrying young children and running blindly into the distance.</p>
<p>Power poles fell, their long bodies lying in the streets. Electrical wires scattered on the ground, weaving an irregular web. In the great fire, the entire German Consulate was burned by the enemy's bombs, while the large waterworks next to it was safe and sound. The towering water tower still stood tall. Was it that the enemy's bombing skills were too poor, or were they deliberately opposing the Allied nations?</p>
<p>The fire continued to burn, and countless houses and properties continued to be destroyed!</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>In Chongqing after the disaster, during the day, people could no longer be seen walking on the streets. Douyou Street and Lianglukou streets were deserted. Everywhere one looked, there were broken walls and ruins, walls burned red, telephone poles and beams turned to charcoal. A foul, pungent smell made one dizzy. The bombed-out areas were frighteningly dark at night, with not a single shadow to be found. The desolation and misery were indescribable!</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River, during the day, apart from soldiers and messengers carrying official business, no one could be seen crossing the river in small boats!</p>
<p>Houses and shops near the disaster area were mostly closed. Not a single good pane of glass could be found in the doors and windows. Travelers from outside the city went out during the day to avoid the air raid alarms, but could not find a place to spend money on food when they returned at night, so they all left hungry!</p>
<p>In total, the enemy planes’ mad bombing of Chongqing destroyed no fewer than five thousand buildings. No fewer than ten thousand of our compatriots were bombed to death or burned to death. The prosperity of the entire city was reduced to ashes, but our military institutions and political and economic organs were undamaged. We can see very clearly the reason for the enemy planes' mad bombing of Chongqing. The enemy was indeed using such cruel and terrifying methods to cover up their floundering feet because of the failures on various battlefields and our daily improvement in military affairs. But we believe that our compatriots who have been victimized will surely endure our blood and tears, grit our teeth, and demand this blood debt from the enemy!

<h3 id="e15">The Miao People of Guizhou <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The total number of Miao people in Guizhou Province is approximately 3.7 million, accounting for nearly half of the province's population. Moreover, the areas where the Miao people live are mostly mountainous regions rich in minerals. Therefore, in the development of the Southwest, how to mobilize these ethnic groups is a question worthy of our research.</p>
<p>In general medical books and geography textbooks, the description of the Miao people seems to have become a stereotypical formula. Invariably, it is nothing more than "short clothes, floral skirts, barefoot, walking, hair coiled in strange styles, wearing silver ornaments, conservative customs, and not interacting with Han culture." The section describing the Miao people's clothing is fairly accurate, because usually, we can see Miao women in various parts of Guizhou wearing short clothes and skirts. However, the skirts are not entirely floral; some are blue. And the hairstyles on their heads have many different types. Some wear silver ornaments, while others do not. Therefore, due to the differences in various styles, the Han people give them different names, such as Green Miao, Floral Miao, White Miao, Twisted-Head Miao... a total of no fewer than seventy or eighty types. There are also names based on the areas where they live, such as East Miao, West Miao... The more advanced Miao people are called Yi people and Tujia. Most of the Yi people and Tujia can speak Han Chinese, and are almost completely the same as the Han people. Among them, there is also a group called Songjia Miao, who can be considered the most cultured group among the Miao people. According to them, they are descendants of Duke Xiang of Song from the Warring States period, and they even have their own script. Whether this is reliable is difficult to verify.</p>
<p>It is true that the Miao people are conservative, because the areas where they live are all in remote mountainous areas, such as the villages of Songtao, Tongren, Jiangkou, Longli, and Fan Ding... in these counties, transportation is very difficult, and there are very few opportunities for contact with the outside world. Therefore, all customs and habits are still according to the old ways. As for the statement that they "do not interact with Han culture," in fact, it is somewhat untrue. The Miao people not only have already begun to integrate with Han culture, but also regard it as a supreme honor. At the "gan chang" – market days – in every town in Guizhou, we can encounter many Miao people. However, as long as they can speak Han Chinese, they absolutely refuse to admit that they are Miao people. "You are very Miao" and "You are very rustic" are phrases that can almost be considered a specialty of Guizhou. They mean, "You are too unsophisticated and don't understand anything; you're just like a Miao person." Tracing the origins of this phrase, it is naturally due to the past contempt of the Han people for the Miao people. However, on the other hand, it has had the opposite effect. Since the Miao people know that they are despised, they strive to integrate with Han culture, trying their best to learn Han customs and language, hoping to become like the Han people. Therefore, the previous contempt for the Miao people has become an invisible factor promoting the integration of the Miao people with Han culture. This situation is certainly not right and is mostly a thing of the past. Now, the Guizhou provincial authorities pay great attention to this issue. To avoid making the Miao people feel uneasy, all taboo words such as "Miao," "rustic," and "Yi" are avoided as much as possible to avoid increasing the divide. In Guizhou, the Miao and Han are like two brothers in a family, with the same rights and obligations. Therefore, the view of the Miao people must be new and the old formula abandoned.</p>
<p>Guihai Hengzhi has a few sentences about the Miao people's living habits: "Eating must first be a sacrifice. The Miao people eat with their hands, which shows the legacy of the three ancient times." From this, it can be seen that the Miao people's lives have a distinctive feature, and at the same time, this has also led to many problems:</p>
<p>The Miao people love to eat beef, but they are also very superstitious and feel that eating too much beef is a great sin. Therefore, some Miao people in southern Guizhou even use the method of eating cow dung to atone for their sins. Although this dung is from the stomach to the intestines and has not yet left the abdomen, from a health perspective, it is still not very appropriate.</p>
<p>The way they live also needs to be improved. Usually, people and animals live together. Upstairs is the bed, and downstairs are pigs and horses. In addition, the climate in Guizhou is humid and there is a lot of miasma, so there are many people among the Miao people who suffer from dysentery and malaria. Moreover, after they get sick, they do not ask for a doctor, but only invite a kind of person called "Miao Laonai" to "hit the evil spirits." There are many ways to "hit the evil spirits," but they generally involve hanging a chicken or other small animal from the beam and then cutting off its head. It is said that this can remove evil and cure diseases, but of course, this is a superstitious method.</p>
<p>When it comes to clothing, the Miao people are very simple. Women do not wear pants, only skirts, because wearing skirts makes it easier to spread their legs, which is convenient for climbing mountains, walking, and farming.</p>
<p>Moreover, Miao women only wear two sets of skirts throughout their lives: one for going up the mountain and one for "gan chang." The material is very durable homespun cloth.</p>
<p>The Miao people's marriage is quite free. The dances held in the suburbs every spring and autumn are a good opportunity for men and women to choose a spouse. After marriage, the bride does not live in the husband's house, but still lives in her mother's house, so the first son is often not the creation of the groom.</p>
<p>In summary, both Miao men and women are very healthy, able to work hard, good at reclaiming wasteland, and their diligence and frugality are especially worthy of our learning. During the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods of the Qing Dynasty, halls were established to govern the Miao people. At first, the Miao chiefs regarded officials as if they were gods and were very respectful to the government. As a result, the general officials were very tyrannical and oppressive to the Miao people, and the number of Han people migrating to Guizhou also increased day by day. In three or four decades, the Miao people's residential areas were almost completely occupied. The Miao people were indignant and advocated driving out the guest people and restoring their homeland. Therefore, there was the Miao Rebellion of the sixtieth year of Qianlong. Later, the Qing court mobilized tens of thousands of elite soldiers from Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces to quell the rebellion. When Minister Chuan Ding was in charge of border affairs, he strengthened military preparations on one hand and established Miao schools on the other, implementing the so-called "half military, half political" ruling method, and delineated three thousand miles of land centered on Guizhou in the southeast as the Miao territory to limit the scope of their activities... This traditional, somewhat imperialistic, erroneous policy has now been completely abandoned. (About Relief Society)</p>

<h3 id="e16">League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting to Discuss China's Application. British Aid China Association Issues Declaration Demanding Sanctions Against Japan <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] The League of Nations Administrative Council Standing Committee is scheduled to open tomorrow. The only important international issue on the agenda is China's application. However, Britain and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly use this opportunity to vigorously conduct diplomatic negotiations. The Danzig issue is not included in the agenda. The Advisory Committee does not intend to discuss it at all, and it is also possible that the public thinks that now is not the time to discuss this explosive issue. British Foreign Secretary Halifax plans to issue a statement on the East Silesian issue at the meeting, which has been determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] The 105th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 22nd. China's application has been included in the agenda. The British Aid China Movement has issued a declaration requesting that the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council at all times, that is, the resolution advocating that member states individually aid China, should be implemented immediately. The method is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Refuse to supply Japan with war materials, especially aircraft, which should be prohibited from being exported to that country; (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economic foundation in a short period of time; (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China to build the southwest provinces, develop industrial cooperation movements, and relieve refugees in the war zones. The above actions should be adjusted by a committee established by the Administrative Council to improve its efficiency. Recently, the governments of some member states of the League of Nations have declared that they are willing to uphold the collective security system. The League of Nations Administrative Council can indeed help China, which is to provide further security for the collective security system. Also, the United States is willing to actively participate in aid to China, which can be seen in President Roosevelt's recent remarks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 21st] Hu Shize, China's representative to the League of Nations, and Fuller, an American expert on opium issues, reported to the League of Nations Opium Committee yesterday on the illegal promotion of the opium trade by the Japanese in the occupied areas. Representative Hu stated that the Japanese openly sheltered opium dens and secret drug factories, and the only condition was that opium dealers must pay taxes. The Japanese consulate was the center for distributing drugs, and transportation was carried out by military trucks and warships. This measure by the Japanese obviously constitutes a major threat to the world, and world public opinion should immediately find ways to stop it.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Progress in British-Soviet Negotiations. Final Consultations in Geneva. Rumor British Will Accept Soviet Suggestions. <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to last night's news, Britain intends to ease its opposition to the Soviet Union's proposals. Reliable sources predict that the cabinet on the 24th will approve the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union, or the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union following the precedent of the Franco-Soviet Pact.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Semi-official sources stated last night that Britain is considering abandoning its plan to oppose the basic principles of the Soviet proposal. Reliable sources expect Chamberlain to appeal to the cabinet on Wednesday to approve the conclusion of a military alliance with the Soviet Union, or to sign an agreement to balance the Franco-Soviet agreement. Soviet officials have not yet criticized Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on Friday regarding the report on the Dantzic situation. The newspapers are also silent, reporting only in five or six lines. The British House of Commons debated foreign policy, but the nature of the debated issues was not mentioned at all.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] It is understood that regarding the British-Soviet alliance, Chamberlain is consulting with the authorities of Poland and Romania, seeking their opinions. The Prime Minister's move is to hope to get a full reply so that he can make a final decision on the British-Soviet alliance at the cabinet meeting next Wednesday. In diplomatic circles, it is believed that Romania agrees with the Soviet Union's participation in the peace front, and Poland's previous opposition to the Soviet Union's accession has now changed somewhat.</p>
<p>Divergent Opinions Greatly Diminished</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] It is said that as a result of continued foreign negotiations in the past 24 hours, Britain and the Soviet Union have seen closer ties. Officials say that Moscow's recent letter has helped to clarify the situation, and it is hoped that subsequent negotiations in Paris and Geneva can achieve considerable progress, so that the cabinet meeting on Wednesday can make a decision. According to informed sources, Britain has indeed tried its best to get closer to the Soviet Union's views, so the differences between the two sides have been greatly reduced. Soviet Ambassador Maisky has left Britain for Geneva.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] Soviet circles did not pay much attention to the fact that Vice Minister Potemkin stopped going to Geneva to meet with Halifax and Lai. The reason has never been expressed here. It is clear that Potemkin's influence in presiding over Soviet foreign policy does not exceed that of Maisky. Soviet officials and newspapers have maintained a silent attitude toward Chamberlain's report on the British-Soviet negotiations in the House of Commons. It is believed here that this is a sign that the Soviet Union's top authorities are not prepared to conduct a new case against Britain. At the same time, informed sources believe that the authorities must have instructed Maisky to continue negotiations with Halifax in Geneva, and after Halifax has met with the French authorities in Paris, it can be hoped that a compromise between Britain and the Soviet Union will be reached.</p>
<p>British and French Talks are Harmonious</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] According to authoritative sources, as a result of British Foreign Secretary Halifax's consultation with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, a mutual alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has a "possibility of rapid completion." If this alliance is established, it will not include the Baltic states.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] After British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax arrived here today, he held a long talk with Prime Minister Delatier and Foreign Minister Bonet at the Ministry of the Army at 5:10 PM. In addition to several experts from both countries assisting him, British Ambassador Sir Phipps also participated in the matter. It was not finished until 7:50 PM. The official did not issue a statement to explain the progress of the talks. When Prime Minister Daladier met with reporters, he only said that today's talks were extremely harmonious. Members of the British and French cabinets and experts then had dinner together at the Ministry of the Army. There were eight people in the meeting, and talks continued during the meeting. Foreign Secretary Halifax then took a train to Geneva at 9:35 PM with Malkin, a legal expert from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Strong, Director of the Central European Department, and Baker, Director of the Intelligence Department, to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also traveled in the same car. (According to Ambassador Maisky, who arrived here from London this morning).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Prime Minister Daladier, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet met at the Ministry of the Army tonight, lasting nearly three hours, discussing the entire international situation. It is said that this talk showed absolute harmony between Britain and France. Halifax and Bonnet will continue to consult in Geneva, at which time they can also contact Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. It is the general impression here that Halifax and 　Radier and Lai’s meeting were very satisfactory, but the substantial establishment of the British-Soviet agreement still needs some time, while Soviet sources here said that they hope that the agreement can be established in the near future.</p>
<p>France and the Soviet Union Take the Same View</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The "London Observer" diplomatic correspondent stated today that tomorrow's talks in Geneva will be the last opportunity to discuss military cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The important talks between Halifax and France last night have been confirmed here. It is said that the French government and the Soviet Union take the same view that only full military cooperation can complete the defensive wall of the peace group.</p>
<p>The French Cabinet Holds a Meeting</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] Before the British Foreign Secretary arrived, the French Cabinet convened a meeting at 10:00 this morning, focusing on discussing the stalemate in the British-Soviet negotiations. The French Foreign Minister reported on the Franco-Turkish agreement and the French government's decision to hand over Alexandria to Turkey, and said that the Spanish government was completely independent and neutral and was willing to cooperate for European peace and had expressed guarantees to France, asking France not to worry about being attacked on three sides when the war broke out. The Soviet Ambassador to Britain arrived here yesterday and transferred to Geneva. He first met with the Soviet Ambassador to France to explore the recent French attitude and situation, so as to provide a reference for the continued British-Soviet negotiations in Geneva in the future.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] The "detailed content of the new British plan on which the British-Soviet negotiations will be based in the future cannot be explored, but it has aroused great attention from all parties. According to news reports, the plan has been taken to Paris by Foreign Secretary Halifax so as to discuss it jointly with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Lai. The plan was drafted in accordance with French suggestions, and its content has very important concessions to the Soviet Union's views. According to the "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent, the French plan slightly disagreed with the Soviet Union's proposal that major countries should consider the issue of safeguarding Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent analyzed the differences between the British and Soviet views and said that the Soviet Union advocated signing a tripartite agreement, while Britain advocated that countries jointly issue a declaration. The scope of the guarantees proposed in the agreement proposed by the Soviet Union actually exceeded the scope of the British proposal, while Britain determined that Poland and Romania must be taken care of first, because the two countries must be the first to defend themselves in the event of a threat.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Mussolini said today in Cuneo, "After the signing of the German-Italian alliance, it will become a group of 150 million people, and no one in the world will be able to match it." Amidst enthusiastic applause, Mussolini continued, "This group, in terms of manpower and military equipment, possesses invincible power. Although its purpose is to hope for peace, if stubborn and reactionary democratic nations attempt to obstruct our progress, we will inevitably abandon peace. Italy is currently maintaining a silent attitude, but when the time comes, the Italian people will definitely express themselves. Italy has a population of 45 million, with ten million people bearing arms, and their will is united." The audience shouted again, and Mussolini said, "Your cheers prove that the unity of the people is not empty words." Mussolini concluded by saying that his speech in Turin was very detailed, so he did not want to say much today. "If the need arises, the Italian people will rise up and express themselves."</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 20th] After inspecting the frontier defenses in Aosta today, Mussolini delivered a speech. When he spoke to the point that "Our Alpine troops are sufficient to overcome any delusions," the crowd shouted slogans such as "Nice, Savoy!" Mussolini continued that Italy could wait for the opportunity, that Italy had one million soldiers ready to fight at any time, and that military equipment was sufficient. "I do not know what path the democratic nations will take, but we are waiting for the opportunity, preparing to respond to all events. The past sixteen years have fully demonstrated our country's strength and determination, which is powerful and irresistible. Those protected by democratic nations have all failed one after another, and the banks of the Thames have become the only place for exiles to breathe. I hope that the people of the whole country can understand my intentions. The victories we have achieved today, future victories will also be in our grasp."</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Former British Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a speech in Horsham today, stating that he absolutely agreed with the government's policy. He said, "Britain is prepared to reason with those who are reasonable, and at the same time, it is prepared to resist anyone who attempts to oppress neighboring countries by force. In the world, there are no warmongers except for the so-called followers of Fascism and Nazism. But if the leaders of Fascism and Nazism insist on resorting to force, they will definitely encounter resistance from other countries in the world. This great power is something that no one can resist, even a hero like Napoleon could not avoid it. No one can hope to succeed Napoleon. It is hard to believe that a wise and capable person like Hitler would make such a big mistake in politics." Baldwin concluded by saying that his current belief that all ordinary people in the world, including the people of Germany and Italy, would ultimately or even in the near future achieve victory, was stronger than before.</p>

<h3 id="e24">A Warrior's Intimidation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The military alliance between Germany and Italy, according to various telegrams, will be officially signed today (the 22nd) in Berlin with a "grand ceremony." The eastern ×× Japanese rulers have been fiercely fighting over whether to join this alliance in the past few days, but according to yesterday's news, they have decided to participate. In fact, they only have this path to take.</p>
<p>The military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy cannot surprise the world today, because based on the facts since the establishment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," this agreement has long been recognized by the world as a de facto military alliance of aggressive countries. The main reason why the three Eastern warriors officially announced the establishment of the alliance today is that, in view of the new progress of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression front, they want to use it to intimidate the capitalist rulers of certain democratic countries! How the three warriors threaten and actually damage the rights and interests of all peaceful countries is common knowledge, so this new intimidation by the warriors is not very surprising.</p>
<p>However, it is an unforgivable mistake to excessively ignore the intimidation of the warriors today, that is, to excessively ignore the military alliance between Germany and Italy, and even between Japan, Germany, and Italy, because it is a powerful backlash against the anti-aggression group movement of democratic and peaceful countries. First, it is possible to threaten Britain and France with more crazy speculative adventures; second, it is even more possible for Japanese × to benefit by inducing and threatening Britain, the United States, and France, especially or threatening these countries. Therefore, if a strong counterattack is not given, that is, if the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are not used to counterattack, not only will there be a danger of a new war breaking out in Europe, but Japanese × will also have the danger of advancing from Gulangyu to Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou ××××, ×××!</p>

<p>[Reuters, Danzig, 21st] A group of Germans attacked the Polish customs in Katholf near the border of East Prussia today, and the situation there is very tense. The group of Germans first opened fire on the customs, and the tax officer, at the request of the police officer, temporarily　withdrew. The Germans then destroyed it. The Danzig police chief has sent Deputy Chief Pan to investigate. Pan went alone, refusing to bring escorts. When Pan arrived at the scene and got out of the car to inspect the area where the dispute occurred, the group of Germans attacked his driver again. The driver fired three shots into the air and then fired two more shots, wounding one person. According to sources responsible in Warsaw, the driver killed one person.</p>
<h3 id="e26">A Meeting with the Ex-Kaiser of Germany <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— J. V. Kurenberg, translated by Wang Shen'e</p>
<p>Little has been heard about Wilhelm II, the once-famous ruler of Germany. Many guests who visited the ex-Kaiser were not allowed to write about him, but this article is an exception. The author is the son of Prussian King Péro, the former German Prime Minister.</p>
<p>It was the early morning of November 10, 1918. A train not found on the timetable pulled into the small station of Eysden, located in the southernmost outpost of the Netherlands. Sitting in the carriage's reception room was the ex-Kaiser of Germany, who had just abdicated from Spa, within the occupied Belgian territory, where the German Imperial Headquarters was situated. The ex-Kaiser was now taking refuge in the safe zone of neutral Holland.</p>
<p>The collapse of the royal family was the first confirmation that the World War was coming to an end.</p>
<p>The stationmaster telephoned the Foreign Minister in The Hague. The Foreign Minister was very surprised by this almost unbelievable news. So the Foreign Minister telephoned the Dutch nobility in his bedroom, speaking very urgently; and managed to find Amerongen Castle for the Kaiser as a temporary refuge, which was generously donated by the Bentinck family.</p>
<p>At this desolate station, a cold winter rain was falling on the open platform. Kaiser Wilhelm II slowly walked down the army, his face sorrowful, his hands deeply inserted into the pockets of his gray coat, waiting for the Dutch government's permission to pass through to safety.</p>
<p>Twenty years have passed since that November. That defeated and declining figure has lived very quietly in Holland since that year. He has reached the age of eighty, and whatever shortcomings he may have had as a ruler, he now leads an exiled life with quiet dignity, which is worthy of infinite sympathy. In 1920, the Kaiser was forced to abdicate and took up residence in the castle of Huis Doorn.</p>
<p>Doorn is a secluded village in the middle of the Netherlands with 7,000 residents. A casual visitor would not expect such a prominent exile to be living there. Every child knows this "house," but calling this house a castle, even according to the Dutch style, still feels too small. The big ladle that makes up the semicircle can be seen on the road. A plainclothes detective carefully questions visitors at the door, and another gendarme wanders nearby.</p>
<p>Visitors are led to a room where two red leather books are placed side by side, one with a W on it and one with an H. Anyone who goes to see the ex-Kaiser must write their name in the handbook. Among those inscriptions are many expressions of loyalty, words of comfort, and passages from the Bible. The visitor's handbook is placed on the ex-Kaiser's left and right every night, and the ex-Kaiser reads it in great detail.</p>
<p>Across the garden. There is a wide road leading to the Imperial Palace, with neat lawns on both sides, surrounded by age-old yew trees. The house is in the style of a Dutch aristocratic manor, with two floors and red brick walls covered with green vines, set off by spotless white window sills. Across the circular pool, the two wide glass front doors in front of the house were opened, and two servants in black uniforms bowed to welcome visitors inside.</p>
<p>Up　stairs, the first thing that caught the eye was the full-length portrait of the Dutch Governor and his wife, which is Wilhelm II's way of expressing his respect for Orange　Nassau. The ex-Kaiser had a deep relationship with them. He was often very happy to admit this relationship, as can be seen from the gift he sent to Buckingham Palace in London a few years ago, the statue of Emperor Governor William III.</p>
<p>A military map was spread out on the table. China, following Spain and Abyssinia, has become a battle outpost, attracting the Kaiser's deep attention. Small flags were stuck on the map,　clarifying the location of the troops. The Kaiser is the only survivor of the military in the Great War; what attracts visitors the most is that the room is decorated with many fresh flowers.</p>
<p>The dining room is in the back, with a panoramic view of the garden. In the evening, the people at the dining table were happy and solemn. The porcelain in the "Berlin" New Palace is used here. But if you think the Kaiser's dinner is sumptuous, you are wrong, on the contrary, everything is very simple. The simplicity of each dog's menu is probably unparalleled in　many royal families.</p>
<p>The housekeeping at Doorn is quite thoughtful. One night, the Kaiser took a small guest on his lap and asked, "Now, please tell us what we are going to eat tonight?"</p>
<p>The child said, "Duck—son."</p>
<p>The Kaiser said again, "Then, what do we eat for the second time this week..." But the wide room manager said that the food would be used up during the first dinner.</p>
<p>A very small staircase leads to the first floor. The guests were not given a bunch of flowers, and they were led into the half-dark room of the late Queen Augusta Victoria. Visitors put the flowers　on the white felt covering the coffin.</p>
<p>Above is a picture of the Gaslow region——as a memory of the previous glorious era. On her recent constitution's writing　table, there are more than fifty separate frames putting her descendants' photos. In the lonely exiled life, she often sat there, feeling that she was with many dear juniors who stayed elsewhere. She had many beloved grandchildren, and the family life was simple and melted, even in the days of holding power and glory.</p>
<p>The neighboring　Ming is very quiet　, Princess Hermine, the successor of the German emperor,　here drinks afternoon tea, which is an English custom, but Doorn runs the warning very carefully. Princess Hermine is knowledgeable and widely read, and her criticism of classical books shows wisdom and vision. Her thoughts and actions are like a modern woman. Last year, she allowed her eldest daughter to marry a commoner, and she frankly admitted that she liked everything in the new Germany, and she personally knew Hitler.</p>
<p>The Kaiser is accustomed to walking to tea, he walks to his wife's room with lively steps, making people feel that he is not an 80-year-old man, he wears dark black home clothes, he likes to wear white vests and leggings inside, now he only wears a few rings, there is a large pin on the tie, and a small cross on the buttonhole.</p>
<p>The Kaiser has　thin white hair and a very compassionate　good beard, he does look like a prominent figure. The action is calm and　beautiful. A sharp eye shows the old man's　brilliant spirit.</p>

<h3 id="e27">×Cotton Yarn Supply Short, ×Raw Materials Lacking; Over a Hundred Peninsula Textile Factories Close Down; ×Yarn Nearly Disappears from the Market in Recent Months, Many Small Factories Suspend Work; Over a Thousand Workers Idle and Helpless <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Since the military and since, Hong Kong has been in a neutral position, safe and worry-free. The number of inland capital fleeing to Hong Kong is quite large. Therefore, in the past 20 months or so, all industries in Hong Kong have been thriving and prosperous. In particular, the small-scale weaving industry in the peninsula has been particularly prosperous. According to statistics, the increase in the past year or so should be around five or six hundred. These small-scale weaving factories mostly use multiple mobile phones, installed in buildings, employing dozens of male and female workers, engaged in weaving. The products they produce are mainly shirts, socks, lace, towels, etc. Nineteen of the above-mentioned textile products sold in the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon market are manufactured by these weaving factories. In addition to the Hong Kong market, they are also sold in various parts of Southeast Asia. The number of male and female workers employed in these weaving factories is four to five thousand. They are all paid by the piece, with no fixed monthly salary. Those who work quickly can earn seven or eight cents a day, otherwise it is usually three or four cents. However, the number of people who rely on this directly and indirectly for a living is unknown, which accounts for an important part of Hong Kong's industry. The raw materials used by these small-scale weaving factories in the past, such as cotton yarn and rayon, are almost entirely supplied by Japan. The price of Japanese cotton yarn and rayon is about half the price of products from India and Canada, so the cost of manufacturing products is lighter, and even if they are sold cheaply, there is still a large profit to be made. Recently, however, the source of Japanese cotton yarn and rayon has become less and less, and today it has almost disappeared from the market. The general small factory owners in the peninsula are greatly panicked due to the lack of raw material supply. In the past week, it is not uncommon for people to announce the temporary suspension of the public to avoid losses on the leather fees. The reporter investigated the areas where small weaving factories are located, such as Kowloon City, Sham Shui Po, and Hung Hom yesterday. It is estimated that in the Kowloon City area alone, there are 53 small weaving factories that have announced a temporary shutdown. In addition to more than 70 in Hung Hom and Sham Shui Po, there are more than 20 larger-scale factories with dozens of male and female workers in two shifts day and night. These hundreds of closed weaving factories have more than a thousand men and women in total. In addition to the permanent workers, the rest of the part-time workers are paid by the piece. Once they stop working, their lives will be severely hit and they will be trapped in helplessness. Although they want to find work in other large factories, it is not easy to find a job in today's situation where people are overwhelmed. What will they live on? It is a question. According to people in the weaving industry, ×cotton yarn and rayon have always been sold at low prices to seize the market. Now the source has been cut off. This shows that ×military consumption due to the invasion is too great, and the lack of domestic resources and raw materials has fallen into an extreme situation. The future of ×industry is very pessimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Tragedy of Landslide at Sai Wan Ho: Three Dead and Two Injured in the Collapse of a Shack - After Continuous Heavy Rain, a Large Amount of Mud and Boulders Suddenly Collapsed Violently, Crushing to Death an Elderly Woman and Two Girls, and a Man's Left Arm Was Broken <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Continuous heavy rain in Hong Kong these days, as if pouring down, the soil on the mountains in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been eroded by the rain for several days, and the water flowing down the mountains has washed down more than a dozen places, causing traffic to be blocked and inconvenient. At 4:45 pm yesterday, dozens of wells of mud and boulders collapsed on the mountain above Chuanlong Pit in Sai Wan Ho, hitting the back of a house in the pit. A part of it collapsed as a result. At that time, three women and children were unable to escape and were tragically buried alive. A man also had his left arm broken, and a woman had minor facial injuries. The details of the tragedy that occurred are recorded below.</p>
<p>Sai Wan Ho Mountain Half Chuanlong Pit</p>
<p>Chuanlong Pit is located on the mountainside above Sai Wan Ho. There are more than 20 old-style houses built on the side of the pit, all with brick and stone or wooden walls and tile or wooden roofs. The buildings are extremely simple. Most of the residents are Hakka people. They mostly raise pigs and grow crops. On the south side of the pit, there are three houses in a row, built next to each other. These three houses are not numbered. The first house on the right is inhabited by four families, Huang, Zeng, Chen, and Yang, with about a dozen people, old and young. The back of the house is a mountain ridge, and the front faces a huge pit that is seven or eight feet deep.</p>
<p>Continuous Heavy Rain, Landslide</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rain these days has eroded these simple buildings, which are already showing signs of looseness. The water flowing down the mountain behind the house is like a river, and the walls behind the house are constantly impacted and soaked until they are loose. At 4:45 pm yesterday, when the rain was clearing up, the people in the house were deeply rejoicing. Unexpectedly, at this moment, dozens of tons of mud and stones suddenly collapsed from the mountain. The force was extremely violent, like ten thousand horses galloping, unstoppable. The back wall of the house was directly hit. With a loud crash, the back of the house collapsed. The old woman Huang (54 years old), the girl Zeng Song (5 years old) and Chen Xiang (3 years old), who were sitting in the back of the house, were unable to escape and were buried by the landslide. At the same time, a man named Yang Zhuoxin (26 years old) was also unable to escape in time, and his left hand was broken by a fallen fir tree. Huang's daughter also suffered abrasions on her face. Other residents were fortunate to escape quickly and were spared.</p>
<p>Three Dead, Two Injured</p>
<p>After the house was unfortunately collapsed by the landslide, nearby residents heard the news and rushed to the rescue, but only Yang Zhuoxin and Huang's daughter were rescued, while Huang and the two girls were buried in the mud. At the same time, some residents, seeing this tragedy, immediately reported to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station. The on-duty officer of the station dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate after receiving the report, and also transferred the Public Works Department to send workers to the scene to excavate, and summoned ambulances to the scene to send Yang Zhuoxin and Huang's daughter to Mary Hospital for treatment. Public Works Bureau workers excavated for a long time before Huang and the bodies of the two girls were exhumed one after another, and transported to the morgue by hearse for autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e33">The China Salvation Drama Troupe's Great Charity Performance Is Approaching - Three Famous Plays "Long Live the Nation" Will Be Performed - The Cost of Scenery and Costumes Reaches More Than Five Thousand Yuan <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>All the members of the China Salvation Drama Troupe are veterans of the drama circles in Shanghai and other places. In the past 20 months, they have marched through the north and south battlefields. In the actual experience, the progress is particularly rapid. In the field of emerging drama in our country, it is the most famous advanced drama troupe. The Hong Kong Relief Committee admires the troupe's artistic refinement and has specially requested the troupe to hold a large-scale charity performance before going abroad, in order to raise funds to comfort wounded soldiers and refugees, and to carry out patriotic propaganda. It has now been decided that from the 25th of this month, for three consecutive nights, the three famous plays "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" will be performed at the Lee Theatre. The plot of "Long Live the Nation" is tense and touching everywhere. "Defend the Motherland" is composed of the troupe's four most wonderful short plays, and the representative work "Put Down Your Whip," which has been performed more than 700 times, is also included. "Spring in Taierzhuang" is the troupe's collective creation, which is both solemn and lively, meaningful and full of interest. In addition to the actors and scripts being the best, the scenery, costumes, props, and lighting have all been newly purchased, totaling more than 5,000 Hong Kong dollars. All of them are voluntarily donated by the troupe. Its greatness and realism break the unprecedented record of war dramas in Hong Kong. All kinds of electric lights are used to set off the morning, noon, dusk, and night. The gale and violent storm, and the lightning flashing, are lifelike. The audience is as if they are on the scene. The Journalists Association, entrusted by the Relief Committee to co-organize this performance, is stepping up its work as the performance is approaching. Yesterday, it specially entertained the persons in charge of the Education Association to discuss the method of being responsible for ticket sales, and asked Lu Guomian to plan to carry out indoor ticket sales with various businesses. To raise funds to help the needy, to appreciate the most advanced drama and art, I hope that our enthusiastic overseas Chinese will squeeze in and rush to buy tickets at that time, and don't miss the opportunity.</p>

<p>All parts of the Far East have wireless telephones to connect with other places, but Hong Kong is uniquely lacking. According to reports, the Hong Kong authorities have now drafted a plan to install wireless telephones to connect with cities in the British Empire. Although the experimental plan has been drafted, some details are still to be studied. When this plan is implemented in the future, the first places to communicate with this country will be Manila, Singapore, and India. Regarding the Hong Kong installation of wireless telephone meter, the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong Telephone Company are now negotiating to decide to take charge of this matter separately. The contract can be established soon. The cost of wireless telephone calls has not yet been decided. In the future, the current price of wireless telephone calls between Hong Kong and Shanghai will be the standard, and will be increased or decreased according to the distance. The installation of wireless telephones in Hong Kong is part of the British Empire's transportation development plan. There are now wireless telephone connections between Singapore and London, and wireless telephones with the United States are also being prepared.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, a fisherman arrived in Hong Kong from Macau by wheel. According to what he told reporters, on the morning of the 19th of this month, a certain fishing boat registered in Macau sailed to the Xiangzhou sea area and was fishing. Suddenly, three aircraft flew overhead. Seeing that there were fishing boats, they immediately flew low and strafed with machine guns. At that time, other fishing boats saw the situation and fled one after another. However, the shipowner of the fishing boat, Chen, was unable to sail away in time and was sunk. At that time, there were six or seven crew members on board, all of whom died. Only the shipowner, Chen, was seriously injured and barely survived. When his ship sank, he grabbed a floating object and drifted to the surface of the sea. After the aircraft passed, he dared to call for help. Soon, another fishing boat passed by and rescued Chen, took him back to Macau and reported to the authorities. After receiving the report, the Macau police immediately summoned an ambulance to send Chen to the hospital for treatment. The Macau police are currently conducting research on the occurrence of this unfortunate incident.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three residents (two men and one woman) of a thatched cottage on the side of Luo Mountain in Shau Kei Wan brought grass-cutting knives and bamboo poles to cut leather near the Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir in the morning. Unexpectedly, ten wild dogs suddenly ran out of the mountainside fiercely. The grass-cutting men and women initially thought they were hunting dogs raised by Westerners and did not pay attention. Then they heard their cries were different from ordinary dogs, so they immediately took precautions and did not dare to act. The wild dog group eventually crossed another mountain peak and left. Afterwards, the three men and women did not dare to cut grass again, and returned to Shau Kei Wan to report the case in a wolfish manner.</p>

<p>At 10:45 pm the night before last, the Far East Water Pipe Manufacturing Company on Castle Peak Road in Tsuen Wan was robbed by armed robbers. Fortunately, the clerk was alert and bravely resisted with a knife, and finally repelled the robbers and avoided losses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Holding a Cleaver, Waiting in Formation</p>
<p>The Far East Water Pipe Manufacturing Company is located on Castle Peak Road, a rather remote location. After nightfall, it is even quieter. The company's employees leave after work, leaving only a clerk, Li Wenyu, to guard. Li is 40 years old and lives with his wife, Lin Quan, in a small house near the company. There has been no difference in the past. Last night, at 10:45 pm, Mr. and Mrs. Li were already fast asleep. Lin Quan suddenly noticed an unusual sound from the door fan. Knowing that it was not a good sign, she pushed Li awake and told him everything. Li remained silent, secretly got up, grabbed a cleaver, and waited for the robbers to enter before attacking head-on.</p>
<p>Swinging the Knife, Two Thieves Were Injured</p>
<p>Before long, the door of the house had indeed been pried open. In the darkness, three burly men were seen, one holding a handgun and the other two holding iron rulers and other weapons. They rushed in. Seeing that they had bad intentions, Li swung his knife forward and slashed at the robbers. The thieves were caught off guard and hurriedly fired a gun to demonstrate, trying to stop Li. However, Li was not intimidated at all and swung his knife wildly, resulting in a melee. Lin Quan blew a whistle to call the police. The thieves knew that the matter had been exposed, and two of them had been cut and injured by Li in the melee, so they fled in a panic. Li did not pursue them. After the incident, he went to the police station to report the case.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Salt Fields in the New Territories - Salt Is Produced in Lantau Island and Castle Peak <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>It is really strange to say that news about "salt" is rarely found in Hong Kong news. Recently, we have only seen one or two news items reporting that "Hong Kong's table salt is shipped from Siam!"</p>
<p>Probably not only me, but many readers will not believe that Hong Kong's table salt is shipped from Siam, because Hong Kong has its own salt yang and produces salt every day, and there are also many large and small salt shipments to other places for sale.</p>
<p>Hong Kong residents do not eat salt produced locally in Hong Kong, but instead take it from Siam. According to the principle of revitalizing local goods, it seems a bit contradictory. Now let me introduce Hong Kong's local salt!</p>
<p>Some of Hong Kong's salt fields are located in Lantau Island and some are located in Castle Peak in the New Territories. There are more in Lantau Island than in Castle Peak. In recent years, it seems that the economy has been a bit sluggish. Many of the salt fields in Lantau Island are barren and dilapidated, and many salt-water grasses have grown. This is probably the result of Hong Kong people not eating Hong Kong salt.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I went to Castle Peak to visit a salt farm. The owner of the farm was very polite and explained the salt-making process to me. Now I will introduce what the owner of the salt farm told me to the readers. Salt is made of seawater. The raw materials used must be used during manufacturing. Since no raw materials are needed, of course, no capital is needed. The only raw material is seawater. It also relies on intense sunlight. After several hours of exposure, large salt is naturally formed, also known as raw salt and coarse salt. Approximately eight hours of "sun exposure" will complete the task, but salt cannot be made on rainy days. People who rely on salt making to eat can only "eat grain seeds."</p>
<p>The area of a salt field is about the same size as a paddy field. The bottom of the salt field is paved with flour-like fine sand. The sand surface must be flattened. If it is concave and convex, the seawater put in cannot evenly stay on the field surface, and the salt crystallization will be affected.</p>
<p>When the tide rises, the salt field people first put the seawater into a reservoir. After a considerable period of time, the water in the reservoir has been filtered eight or nine times, so they put the water in the reservoir into the salt field. The salt field is sealed on all sides so that water cannot leak. Three to five parts of water on the field surface is enough. After eight hours of sunlight exposure, these three to five parts of water will all turn into white salt, which looks like a thin layer of flour. When collecting salt, use a gentle method to sweep away the salt, and then flatten the sand. The next day, do the same thing again, and get the harvest of the second day. In short, the people in the field must work diligently, and there must be sunshine every day. Each salt field can earn more than 20 yuan per head, which is more profitable than planting rice and other grains.</p>
<p>According to people in the salt industry, part of the production of Hong Kong's salt fields is sold to Bao'an and Dongjiang, part of it is sold locally to residents of the New Territories, and part of it is sold to fishing boats. Under Castle Peak, there are even three or four salt grinding businesses, which move large raw salt and coarse salt into small mills and instantly turn it into fine table salt. The color is also snow-white and clean. The main customers of salt shops are large fishing boats going to sea. Fishing boats must prepare before going to sea, but a small number of fishermen use the high prices on the mainland to smuggle salt in the name of fish. With such main customers, the business is also very prosperous. Now, due to the blockade by the warship, fishing boats dare not smuggle salt as rampant as before, and the salt grinding business is also not as good as before.</p>
<p>Salt is a daily necessity. The population of Hong Kong is now estimated at 1.5 million, and the estimated daily demand is about 30,000 catties. How can we bear to let this huge amount of money flow into Siam. Hong Kong itself is a salt field, so why don't we promote local goods vigorously? If we can maintain Hong Kong residents eating Hong Kong salt, the salt fields and other direct and indirect industries will be greatly and positively affected!</p>

<h3 id="e43">Sanshui × General to Hold Meeting, Vainly Attempting to Eliminate Our Guerrillas, Our Forces Repeatedly Launch Surprise Attacks on Puppet Troops in Various Places, × Exhausted and Appealing for Assistance from Guangzhou and Foshan <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Xijiang Express) In Sanshui, Xijiang, small skirmishes have occurred frequently in the past week. × Frequent troop movements, busy deploying defenses. It is reported that the frontline × army, due to the activity of our guerrillas, has appealed for assistance from Guangzhou and Foshan. Yesterday, the 18th, over two thousand × soldiers and a large quantity of ammunition were transferred to the Hekou-Xinan-Ganggen area of Sanshui. Consequently, transportation along the Guang-San (Guangzhou-Sanshui) line has become busy again, with military vehicles constantly moving. It is estimated that by the 18th, over four hundred boxes of military supplies had been transported to the front lines, mostly stored in the town of Xinan. However, there has been no unusual movement by the × troops. The weather in Xijiang has been unfavorable in recent days, with frequent overcast skies and rain on the front lines. × Aircraft have temporarily ceased operations.</p>
<p>Attack on Makou, Our Army Achieves Minor Victory</p>
<p>Yesterday, the × troops stationed at Makou, Ganggen, and Dalulu on the south bank of Sanshui were suddenly attacked by our army. On the 15th of this month, a unit of Commander Zhang's division stationed in Jinli secretly attacked the × Pacification Office in Dongmakou, killing dozens of × officers and soldiers. On the evening of the 17th, our Jinli team again launched a night attack on Makou. First, several dozen commandos were selected to infiltrate the × positions, scout the terrain, and at midnight, they set a fire as a signal, coordinating with the inside to launch a joint attack. Our team deployed effectively, and the × soldiers were attacked everywhere, hastily fighting back. After about an hour of intense fighting, our army became more and more courageous, and the × positions became disorganized. We killed over twenty people and burned down two pontoon bridges near the shore before dispersing in different directions under the cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Night Attack on Xinan, Annihilating Thousands of × Troops</p>
<p>The battle situation in Qingbao, Jinli, and other places has been quiet. According to intelligence from military agencies, the × troops in Hekou and Xinan are moving frequently. The × troops, who had previously penetrated deep into the western districts of Zunnan, Maxi, Pingdan, and Jinguan, have all been recalled to Hekou for concentration, shortening the defense line. However, they occasionally send patrol boats or fire cannons at Luji on the west bank. In Baoyuetang, Sanshui, the × army once sent troops to invade a week ago, but they were defeated by our tax regiment and guerrillas and fled back to Xinan. There is no trace of × troops in the Yangmei area. On the late night of the 17th of this month, our team attacked Xinan from a certain location, fighting fiercely all night, annihilating hundreds of × troops, capturing two puppet soldiers, and seizing many military supplies. The next morning, they all safely returned to their defenses without losing a single person.</p>
<p>Sanshui × Army to Hold Meeting</p>
<p>Furthermore, the × troops on the Sanshui front, in order to deal with our guerrilla attacks, are not only increasing troop reinforcements for defense but also plotting to eliminate our guerrillas. They have been frequently and secretly discussing suppression plans in the past month. It is reported that the commander of the Xijiang × forces, Brigade Commander Matsumoto, will travel from Foshan to inspect the front lines of Hekou, Sanshui, within the week. He will also convene a meeting at the Hekou Customs House on a certain day, gathering Commander Matsuno of the Sanshui × regiment and many high-ranking officers to discuss military invasion matters. The next day, he will also convene puppet leaders from Hekou, Xinxu, Ganggen, Xinan, Makou, and Yangmei to listen to instructions, using both coercion and enticement in his words. It is said that this × meeting, in addition to dealing with our guerrillas, also contains political conspiracies, attempting to use various means to lure our people into submission and enslavement.</p>

<p>[Zhongshan Express] In Xiaolan Ancient Town, the third district of Zhongshan, × warships frequently spy and carry out pointless shelling. The other day, a × warship sailed from Beijie, Jiangmen, to the open sea and fired cannons at the urban area of Xiaolan, collapsing buildings and injuring people, resulting in a terrible disaster. Yuan Dai, commander of the First Detached Force, telegraphed County Magistrate Zhang Huichang to report and request the dispatch of officials to take charge of the aftermath and guard the local area.

<p>[Zhongshan Express] Wu Fei, the commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Column, has been inspecting the frontline defenses of Zhongshan County in recent days, planning wartime measures, and convening meetings of his subordinate team leaders. He has formulated steps for the reorganization of the teams. In order to be close to Committee Member Fei Ge of the Provincial Government for guidance on wartime military and political measures in nearby counties, Wu telegraphed Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the first district, on the 20th to meet and discuss military and political issues in the counties of the first district, exchange opinions, and consolidate defenses.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Southern Counties Ban Export of Firewood, Merchants Request Adjustment of Supply, Duty-Free Foreign Rice Allowed for Free Purchase and Transport <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Bay Express) Since the population of Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangzhou has surged, the consumption of daily necessities has increased significantly. Taking firewood and rice as examples, the supply is sometimes insufficient, and both firewood and rice prices have risen sharply. Furthermore, due to exchange rate issues, merchants from the interior are rushing to export firewood to supply Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangzhou, seeking huge profits, resulting in a near exhaustion of firewood sources in the interior. Therefore, the counties in southern Guangdong have decided to ban the export of firewood. However, since the production and export of firewood in the interior are originally beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy, firewood merchants are requesting the government to find ways to adjust the situation, allowing the firewood produced in rural areas to be distributed and supply the needs of urban residents.</p>
<p>(Maoming Express) Zhang Yan, the administrative commissioner of the seventh district, previously stipulated the quantity of duty-free foreign rice to be purchased and transported by each county, as well as the procedures for issuing certificates by the county government, in order to alleviate the rice shortage. He sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of Leizhou for reference and implementation. Now, because rice prices are rising day by day, he has made changes to allow merchants from Guangzhou Bay and various counties to freely purchase and transport rice, but they must obtain a certificate from Deputy Officer Li Bangrong of the Mazhang Communications Office of the Special Garrison Command and present it to the customs for inspection before import is allowed. Commissioner Zhang sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of Leizhou Customs, stating: "Regarding the relief of the rice shortage in this district, the provincial government has previously issued an order to allow the duty-free import of 100,000 metric tons of foreign rice. This department has followed this order and stipulated the quantity to be transported by each county, as well as the procedures for issuing certificates by the county government, and has sent a letter to your customs office for reference. Now that rice prices are rising day by day and the counties are collecting funds for purchase, fearing that it will be too late to alleviate the situation, we have made further changes to allow merchants from Guangzhou Bay and various counties to freely purchase and transport rice, but they must obtain a certificate from Deputy Officer Li Bangrong of the Mazhang Communications Office of the Special Garrison Command for statistical purposes. In the future, all imported foreign rice with certificates from the county governments and the deputy officer should be released duty-free."</p>

<p>(Dongxing News) In Shi Luo and Xia Tu, Vietnam, there are only over a hundred overseas Chinese residents, mostly from Qinlian. On April 25th at 5 PM, a Vietnamese child had a quarrel with a Chinese child, involving the parents of both sides in a verbal conflict. The Vietnamese, incited by their gang leader, gathered a mob and rushed into the overseas Chinese shops, beating and looting. Seeing the aggressive momentum, the overseas Chinese endured the insult and temporarily avoided the conflict, hoping for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the Vietnamese thought they had an opportunity and looted the overseas Chinese property and set fire to the houses. Upon hearing the news, the overseas Chinese in Kanghai immediately reported to the local garrison officer, who drove to the scene of the incident to rescue them. By 7 PM, over twenty Vietnamese assailants had been arrested on the spot and are currently being interrogated. It is not yet known whether the Vietnamese attack on the overseas Chinese was incited by × or has other background. However, the Kanghai Overseas Chinese Association, for the safety of the overseas Chinese in the two ports, specially sent Chairman Cao Liu Gong and Committee Member Jiang Rukai to report to the special consul in Haiphong, requesting negotiations for compensation and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again. After receiving the report, the consulate sent Secretary Wei Guanghan to investigate and comfort the affected overseas Chinese, and telegraphed the Consul-General in Hanoi to protest to the French government.</p>

Currently, there are only over six thousand × soldiers, over thirty aircraft, over fifty tanks, and over a hundred armored vehicles (including armored cars) on Qiongya Island. × Intentionally transfers troops frequently to conceal their emptiness. On Weizhou Island, only over a hundred × soldiers are stationed, patrolling the surrounding sea day and night, and the defense is very weak. Residents of the area, unwilling to be oppressed by the brutal × troops, are taking the opportunity to flee back to the mainland to make a living. The other day, the × troops on the island suddenly issued a proclamation, forcing all residents of the island, regardless of gender or age, to provide five days of food and deliver it to the × airport on the island at 6 AM on the 15th of this month. At the same time, the islanders are restricted from locking their doors at any time, day or night, under penalty of death for violation.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Qiong Overseas Chinese in Guangzhou Bay Relieve Suffering Compatriots, Organize Relief Association and Telegraph Various Parties for Appeals <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Bay News) The Qiongya compatriots in this port believe that the Qiongya compatriots cannot withstand the oppression of the brutal × troops and are fleeing for their lives, arriving in this port in large numbers. They have specially established a relief committee to carry out relief efforts. Yesterday, they sent an express mail telegram appealing to various parties, stating: "We believe that our association was originally organized to connect the feelings of fellow countrymen and strive for the unity of fellow countrymen in order to improve the position of Qiongya in Guangzhou Bay. It has not been long since its establishment when Qiongya suddenly fell, and our feelings for the country are extremely painful. Recently, the people of Qiongya who are unwilling to be trampled underfoot by iron hooves are fleeing to the bay in an endless stream, enduring wind and dew, with a tragic situation that shocks the heavens. The old and the weak are supporting each other, and the sounds of sorrow shake the earth. In the future, the number will be immeasurable. Seeing these wailing victims, who would not be grieved? And seeking ways to help, we think of our heroic soldiers, with their fearless spirit, fighting the × people on the front lines. We should also embrace compassionate wishes to relieve the refugees in the rear, in order to conform to the common spirit of unity. However, the capacity of our association is limited and we cannot carry out large-scale relief efforts. Starting with those who are closest, we have established the Qiongya Refugee Relief Committee to take on the mission of relief from the perspective of the Qiongya overseas Chinese in Guangzhou Bay. We are now actively promoting it and starting fundraising to lay the foundation for relief. We earnestly hope that domestic and foreign agencies and charitable organizations will uphold the righteousness of supporting each other in times of adversity and express the sincere heart of unity. Quickly develop kindness and provide assistance. As for distant places, where fundraising cannot reach, if you can feel compassion and automatically donate funds by telegraph to our association, we will be even more grateful. During the War of Resistance, it is necessary to strengthen the strength of all parties. The significance of the relief of refugees is even greater, because maintaining the safety of a part of the refugees increases a part of the vitality of the country. Saving the part is to save the whole, and the future of the War of Resistance will eventually release its great brilliance. How can we leave the Qiongya refugees with no way to repay the kindness? This matter concerns relief and is the eager hope of the fleeing compatriots who have no homes. We hereby present this telegram and sincerely request your consideration. Guangzhou Bay Qiongya Fellow Countrymen Association.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Southern Battlefield of the Dong River <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yuan</p>
<p>(Special Report) The southern battlefield of the Dong River is an important part of the South China guerrilla area. It possesses the vast and wealthy counties of Dongguan and Baoan, and most of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Japanese have used great force to conduct several brutal mopping-up operations against it, attempting to open up the international route of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, but the results have been disastrous; all conspiracies have completely failed.</p>
<p>However, due to inconvenient transportation and the rumors spread by traitors, outside understanding of this battlefield is often unclear. Therefore, I am here to give everyone a truthful introduction:</p>
<p>(1) A Natural Guerrilla Area: "The Lychees of Dongguan" I think many people have already heard of them. "Gua Lü" and "March Red" are all coveted delicacies. This time, due to work, I had the opportunity to taste the flavor of March Red and see the vast and beautiful orchards again. However, this year's Dongguan lychees are a bit different from previous years. They are not only expensive food, but also provide excellent cover for the guerrillas. Because the area is full of dense orchards, the mechanized units of the Japanese cannot exert their effectiveness. Our troops can use its cover to move freely, sometimes transforming from scattered to consolidated to give the Japanese a heavy blow, and sometimes transforming from consolidated to scattered to spread to the surrounding villages, so that the Japanese aircraft cannot detect and threaten our army's actions. It is truly a natural guerrilla area.</p>
<p>(2) The "Mosquito Army" in the Mouths of the Japanese: Our army mostly uses nighttime for combat in this area. This type of warfare has yielded many gains, especially the general attack on the 15th of last month, which made the Japanese tremble with fear. We used two companies of troops to completely eliminate the Japanese sentries on the Shilong Bridge and occupied the Shilong Railway Station. The Japanese army, in a state of great panic, used artillery to bombard the surrounding suburbs all night, and the consumption of ammunition was the highest since the fall of Shilong.</p>
<p>On the same night, our army in Dongguan City used only one company to destroy the most solid defensive fortifications of the Japanese in Xidou, broke into the city. Although we were unable to overcome the entire city due to poor communication, the Japanese were completely routed, with over a hundred casualties (a total of about three hundred people), and three small steel cannons were destroyed by us. After daybreak, they were ordered to rotate defenses and were transferred back to the rear for replenishment.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Japanese in Dongguan and Shilong are in a state of terror at night, unable to sleep in peace, fearing the surprise attacks and assaults of the "Mosquito Army."</p>
<p>(3) The Great Civilian Armed Forces: The civilian armed forces in Dongguan and Baoan counties are much stronger than those in other areas of the Dong River. Machine guns, pistols, and each village has them. Just taking the two villages of ×××× in the ×th district of Dongguan as an example, there are ten light machine guns and over a hundred pistols and two hundred Guangdong-made rifles, and even mortars. Other locally made cannons are countless.</p>

<p>The great writer Shaw had always been very disgusted with movies, so he never wanted to have his works adapted for the screen. Recently, he gradually felt that movies had considerable value, so he was willing to have his work "Pygmalion" made into a film, and there are still a large number of his works in preparation for production.</p>

<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The South China football team is now ready to depart on a distant expedition. Sufficient preparations are necessary. Therefore, the charity match originally scheduled for the day before yesterday and the practice match scheduled for yesterday were both held at Jia Shan. If the ball could be adorned with the elegance of Miss Guan Shan, it would be a grand spectacle. The fans were delighted at this news, believing that South China's farewell contribution was a ball game not to be missed.</p>
<p>However, it has been raining continuously for days, and good things are hard to come by. The charity match was cancelled for this reason, and the practice match was also postponed. The general fans all resented the heavens for not being beautiful. However, as the team's departure is imminent, team leader Mo Qingyin bears full responsibility. Regarding the selection of those going on the expedition, it is believed that further review is still required before a decision can be made. Therefore, with the consent of the British warship HMS Concord, the practice match was rescheduled for today at 5:15 PM, still at Jia Shan. This match is equivalent to a selection match, and the performance of those who are selectable but not yet decided will determine their fate.</p>
<p>Last night, the South China Athletic Association staff held a farewell banquet at the Guangzhou Restaurant, attended by dozens of people. During the banquet, they raised their glasses to wish for victory in the future. However, team leader Mo was painstakingly working on the formalities for one or two undecided players. That is why the full list of expedition members has not been disclosed in the newspapers for so long.</p>
<p>Tonight, South China will hold another celebration banquet at the Jinling Restaurant. This South China tour has also won many honors. We wish that after the expedition, the team will truly live up to its name and revive the spirit of sportsmanship and chivalry.</p>
<p>The South China lineup for today is tentatively set as follows, with substitutions in the middle. The strength of the sailors is also strong, so there should be many exciting moments in the competition. This is predictable.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Continuous Rain Delays Baseball Match South China Stars Feng and Bao to Tour South <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>…(Special Report from this Newspaper) The Open Baseball League, held after the football season, is one of the most enjoyable sports in the summer.</p>
<p>…Two battles were originally scheduled to take place one after the other starting at ten o'clock yesterday: (1) Western Club vs. Hong Kong Club; (2) South China Club vs. Min Diannu, in good order.</p>
<p>…Heaven did not cooperate, and it rained continuously in the morning, causing the players to be unable to go to the battlefield again, just like the good deeds were ruined by the rain god the day before.</p>
<p>…Although only six teams have joined the battle group this year, because a double round-robin system is adopted, it will take about four months of competition to complete everything. It is hoped that it will not rain every time during the battle period, so as not to hinder the activities of the players.</p>
<p>…In the past few sessions, the South China Club had suspended sending teams to participate, the reason being that there was a lack of such people in the village. This year, due to the Sino-Japanese war, many of the best players have gathered in Hong Kong, so South China has re-raised the flag and sent a team to participate in the competition again, and for the first time in seven weeks, they defeated the Yang Club upon their first expedition, leaving a very good impression on people.</p>
<p>…In the South China team, such as outfielder Feng Jingxiang and shortstop Bao Jiaping, are also famous football players. Recently, these two people will be touring the South, which is a great loss to the team.</p>
<p>…The China team was the champion of the previous session, but the players in the team have changed, and the strength seems to be slightly worse than in the previous session. Therefore, they suffered a defeat when they first encountered the Min team. However, the members still know how to work hard and practice diligently in their spare time. Diligence pays off, and their future is still very optimistic. It is not impossible to continue as champions in the future. In general, try to work hard for it (Donglang)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Several Common Mistakes for Beginners in Swimming <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>(3) Mouth Exhaling, Nose Inhaling</p>
<p>In general, people on land are accustomed to the method of exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose. Beginners in swimming also use this habit when they reach the water because they are accustomed to it. However, the breathing method when swimming is the opposite of that on land. If you do not change it, it is simply impossible to talk about swimming. When swimming, in order to easily float and move forward, the head is not very easy to come out of the water. The time for breathing is only between turning the head and raising the head. In this short period of time, to complete the mission of inhaling, a large mouth is naturally more convenient than a small nostril. Moreover, because the nostrils are small, the water dripping on the face can always directly enter the lungs with the inhaled air, causing coughing. Therefore, inhaling must be done with the mouth. When swimming, because the head does not often come out of the water, exhaling must be done in the water. When opening the mouth to exhale in the water, the water will inevitably take the opportunity to invade. To expel the water, small nostrils are naturally more convenient than a large mouth. Moreover, since there is ample time in the water, exhaling does not have to be as rushed as inhaling, and using small nostrils is enough to cope. Therefore, exhaling must be done with the nose. This kind of training is the most basic training for swimmers, and it is also the first thing that beginners in swimming must pay attention to.</p>
<p>(4) Afraid to Open Eyes</p>
<p>When beginners in swimming encounter water entering their eyes, they feel a kind of astringent and unbearable pain, which is very unnatural. Therefore, they are reluctant to open their eyes in the water, and they are unwilling to open their eyes on the surface of the water. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether the direction of swimming is wrong, whether the destination of swimming has been reached, and whether there are obstacles in the water and on the surface of the water without opening your eyes. If you are afraid to open your eyes even on the surface of the water because water has entered your eyes, it is not only extremely wrong, but also very dangerous. However, the discomfort of water flowing into the eyes on the surface of the water is the same as the discomfort of water entering the eyes in the water. Therefore, to develop the habit of opening your eyes, you should practice both on the surface of the water and in the water. You must not reluctantly open your eyes on the surface of the water and close them immediately when you reach the water. With this kind of practice, the habit of opening your eyes is not easy to develop.</p>
<p>(5) Random Movement of Hands and Feet</p>
<p>When swimming, the movements of the hands and feet can help the body float up and make the body move forward. However, they must be moved legally, otherwise there will be no good results. For example, to float up, the downward movement of the hands and feet must be faster and more powerful than the forward movement of lifting the hands and retracting the feet. To move forward, the backward movement of paddling with the hands and kicking with the feet must be faster and more powerful than the forward movement of extending the hands and raising the feet. When performing the movements of stepping with the hands and feet or paddling with the hands and kicking with the feet, you must try your best to increase the area of contact between the hands and feet and the water to increase resistance. When performing the movements of lifting the hands and retracting the feet or extending the hands and raising the feet, you must try your best to reduce the area of contact between the hands and feet and the water to reduce resistance. This is the iron rule of swimming. However, beginners in swimming desperately move their hands and feet randomly because their bodies sink and cannot move forward, hoping to float up and move forward. Because of the rapid movements, the movements they make are contrary to the correct methods. As a result, they sink a little faster and move forward a little slower. Therefore, when beginners in swimming do not move their hands and feet legally, they may as well not move when they encounter danger, and they can still float up with the buoyancy of the water. Otherwise, it may lead to unfortunate results.</p>
<p>(6) Wiping Face and Water</p>
<p>When beginners in swimming have water all over their faces, they often wipe it frequently with their hands. Although this action is not very dangerous, it is enough to affect swimming skills. Because the wiping action, no matter how fast you do it, will always take some time. The main mission of a swimmer's hands is to make the body move forward. If you abandon the main mission and turn to other things, the efficiency of moving forward will definitely be reduced. This is a very obvious fact. The reason for this action is actually related to exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose, and being afraid to open your eyes. Because the water on the face will drip into the eyes and be inhaled into the nostrils. It is not easy to open your eyes, and water will invade the lungs. Wiping it dry will naturally make it easier to open your eyes and breathe smoothly. Therefore, to eliminate this bad habit, you must correct the mistakes of breathing and opening your eyes. If you do not need to raise your head to breathe, and you can open your eyes both inside and outside the water, this unnecessary action will disappear by itself. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities Changing Domestic Economic Environment (Continued) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Excessive Optimism About Shanghai's Abnormal Prosperity is Unwarranted Economic Development of the Southwest Depends on Transportation Construction — Annual Report of Shanghai Bank —</p>
<p>Sharp Reduction in Oils Among exports, oils suffered the most severe reduction, decreasing by 53 million yuan, a decrease of more than 73 million yuan compared to the previous year. This is because tung oil exports fell from more than 89 million yuan in the previous year to more than 39 million yuan this year, which was affected by the obstruction of inland transportation. As for export quantities, textiles, livestock products, minerals, yarn, oils, and tea accounted for the largest proportions in descending order.</p>
<p>Japan Ranks First In terms of country, Japan ranked first in imports this year, increasing from 150.4 million yuan in the previous year to 209.8 million yuan this year. The United States was second, decreasing from 188.8 million yuan in the previous year to 151.2 million yuan. Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Dutch East Indies also decreased compared to the previous year. In terms of export goods, Hong Kong ranked first, increasing from 162.9 million yuan in the previous year to 243.3 million yuan. Japan was second, increasing from 84.3 million yuan in the seventh year to 116.5 million yuan. The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc. also decreased compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Shanghai Trade In terms of port, Shanghai has historically accounted for more than half of the country's import and export trade. This year, it decreased from 91.3 million yuan in the previous year to 49.1 million yuan, while other ports increased from 87.8 million yuan in the previous year to 115.7 million yuan. Shanghai's trade only accounts for less than one-third of the total trade volume. A port's trade must have a vast and accessible hinterland to support it. Now, the Yangtze River Basin, which is Shanghai's hinterland, has been reduced to an occupied area, all industries have been suspended, and transportation is obstructed, making it difficult to transport goods. A decline is almost inevitable. All of these are the effects of the current war, which deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Domestic Trade Domestic trade has also been severely affected by the spread of the war. In the past, the transportation and sales of domestic goods relied on Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou as important distribution centers. This year, the Yangtze River waterway is still blocked. Goods in the war zone are difficult to transport. Even trade between the interior and Shanghai and coastal ports must bypass southern China and be transported to Changsha and Hankou via the Yuehan Railway. After Hankou and Guangzhou fell, they were either transported to Kunming via Haiphong and the Vietnamese Railway, or to Guangxi via Guangzhou Bay and the highway, or to the southwest provinces of Taiwan via Wenzhou, Ningbo, and the Zhegan Railway. Transportation is becoming more and more obstructed. Therefore, the manufactured goods needed in the interior and coastal products are in short supply, and prices are rising daily. The raw materials and food supplied to Shanghai from the interior, such as cotton and wheat, cannot be transported either. Shanghai factories have to rely on foreign cotton and foreign wheat. If the war is prolonged, the economic structure of the interior may tend towards self-sufficiency due to the stagnation of domestic trade.</p>
<p>Prices This year, commodity prices in various places have fluctuated dramatically due to the lack of coordination between supply and demand. In general, they tend to rise. The main reason for this is that production has stopped or transportation is difficult. Demand has not increased, but supply has been greatly reduced. Therefore, although the amount of currency has not increased significantly, the prices of various goods have continued to rise. In Shanghai, the general price index rose from 134.3 in December of the previous year (with 1929 as 100) to 159.4 in December of this year, an increase of about 18%. Except for food, the prices of other commodities have risen significantly. The price of various staple foods has remained very stable. Except for a few cities with an increase in refugees, there is no drastic rise. The good harvest last year provided a sufficient supply, which helped maintain order in the interior and contributed to the wartime economy.</p>
<p>Commerce The commercial effects of the war vary greatly from region to region. In Shanghai, industries and businesses within the International Settlement are prospering due to the damage incurred to the districts within the Chinese sectors and the lack of access to Hongkou and Yangshupu. The high profits seen are unparalleled to previous years and can be attributed to several factors:</p>
<h3 id="e68">Increase in Refugee Population <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Funds have also flowed in, stimulating various consumer businesses, such as department stores, entertainment venues, restaurants, and transportation, all of which have seen significant increases in revenue and profits. Due to the high population density, housing has become a problem, and rents have risen daily. The long-dormant real estate industry has also become active, but only in small-scale real estate transactions for housing and factory use.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Establishment of Foreign Exchange Black Market <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the foreign exchange black market, the foreign exchange rate decreased, so importers with inventories have doubled their profits, such as hardware, western medicine, and woolen cloth industries. Although suffering great losses during the war, they can always compensate for more than enough. Exporters also benefit from the favorable exchange rate, and their goods can be sold at good prices. For example, the silk industry, which has been sluggish for many years, has shown signs of recovery this year due to the sharp increase in commodity prices.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Sharp Reduction in Goods Production <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>This creates a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. For example, the cotton spinning industry relies entirely on Shanghai for the cotton yarn it needs because inland yarn factories have completely stopped production. However, only yarn factories in the safe zone of the International Settlement are operating in Shanghai, so the demand exceeds the supply, and the price of yarn has soared, with a profit of 100 yuan per piece. The year-end surplus is quite substantial. Other industries such as cotton weaving, silk weaving, iron industry, enamel industry, and match industry also have the same phenomenon. Therefore, the establishment of small-scale new factories after the war is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Transportation Obstruction in Production Areas <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>This results in a shortage of goods sources, and those with inventories dominate and hoard, such as the cotton industry. Due to the shortage of goods sources in the dried cocoon industry and raw hide industry, prices continue to rise, and those with large inventories are making huge profits. All of these factors have led to today's abnormal prosperity in Shanghai, which is a special phenomenon in the wartime economy. However, these factors are mostly temporary. Consumers cannot consume permanently, and producers cannot manipulate the supply. Moreover, the wider the occupied area, the narrower the market. Therefore, the economic future of Shanghai cannot be overly optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Domestic Industry and Commerce <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Regarding domestic industries and businesses that have fallen into war zones, weaving is at a standstill. The losses are enormous and incalculable. In the southwestern provinces, factories that relocated from the occupied areas initially concentrated in Hankou. Subsequently, various factories from Wuhan successively moved into the Southwest. Despite the extreme difficulties in transportation, they were eventually able to reach their destinations, and some have already begun manufacturing. Their spirit is truly admirable. In terms of commerce, in major cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, due to population increases, there is a superficial appearance of prosperity. Although people are constantly under the threat of air raids, various industries are still making progress. However, due to transportation difficulties, daily necessities are often in short supply, while native products intended for export have become stagnant. Therefore, the key to developing the economy of the Southwest is transportation infrastructure. The government is currently actively constructing railways and highways and establishing various means of transportation. In the future, transportation will inevitably become more convenient, and the development of the Southwest economy will be easier to undertake. In summary, it can be seen that the domestic economic environment has undergone significant changes due to the war.</p>
<p>Observing the above table, food prices have not risen significantly. Therefore, the cost-of-living index in Shanghai has decreased from 158.54 in December of last year to 154.93 in December of this year. Compared to January before August 13th, it has increased by more than 41 percent. However, this cost-of-living index refers to the living expenses of workers in Shanghai. If the proportion of food in the consumption of ordinary white-collar workers is less than that of workers, then their index will inevitably be higher than in December of last year. As for the prices of manufactured goods in the interior, they have also risen sharply. The price of 20-count cotton yarn in Chongqing once rose to 1,000 yuan per package. In addition, the prices of daily necessities and luxury goods, such as towels, toothbrushes, cigarettes, and beer, have increased by one or two times, which is almost commonplace. However, native products that rely on exports have instead fallen in price due to transportation inconveniences. For example, tung oil, gallnuts, and cotton are being sold at lower prices in the production areas while their prices are rising daily in other ports. The difference in prices often exceeds one time. All of this is due to transportation difficulties and high costs, which have disrupted the coordination of supply and demand. However, what is gratifying is that, although most prices have increased sharply,</p>

<h3 id="e73">"Put Down Your Whip" <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zi</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of intellectual youths fleeing to Hong Kong has been increasing day by day. Here, life is temporarily free from threats, but the problem of living resources has arisen. They must find a way to arrange for the most basic living needs. However, Hong Kong is like a narrow box to them; it is truly difficult to turn around and make a living. Thus, an easy path that eventually becomes difficult lies before them—that is, education. Since anyone with a mouth can speak, in other words, anyone who can speak can "wield the whip" (?). Under this principle, intellectual youths have no choice but to knock on the doors of schools and enter the dead end of education. Also, there are too many people who have received education and can speak, as numerous as flies in the countryside, flying around everywhere. Ultimately, the capacity of schools to hire teachers is limited, and the competition for jobs is becoming increasingly fierce. Unemployment is expected, and there is nothing surprising about it. Those who unfortunately find themselves in the ranks of the unemployed are indeed pitiable, but the extent to which those who have entered the "dragon gate" of education can be considered fortunate is highly questionable. Day after day, night after night, they lecture until their lips are parched and they die, but the content of their lectures does not fully meet the needs of the war of resistance education, nor does it fully align with their own aspirations. They relentlessly灌(guàn, force-feed) detached teaching materials into the minds of the future masters of the country every day and night, doing cultural work that they themselves hate. Because the system of education as private property exists, the relationship between teachers and principals is not much different from the relationship between shop owners and employees. One is a cultural merchant, and the other is a craftsman who provides culture. The latter must constantly be mindful of the former's wishes, paying attention to their own rice bowl, because dismissal is too easy. The reserve army of education in society is overflowing, and filling the position does not require much thought. The teachers are consistently poor and exhausted, like camels on the desert carrying heavy burdens, like oxen dragging plows—these oxen must eat especially little and especially cheaply, like aquatic plants, but they must work quickly and bear a great burden. They must contribute all their strength, bones, flesh, and skin to their masters. "Wielders of the whip" are too miserable!</p>
<p>In the occupied areas and guerrilla zones of our country, there are many tasks that have not yet begun or been completed, urgently requiring a large number of intellectual youths to undertake. The old villages are waiting for the transfusion of new youth. Young teachers who are unwilling to sell their souls, put down your whips! For the sake of the motherland and your own bright future, it is futile to drink a few glasses of clear water and sing a few clear songs to entertain others in a small cage. Prolonged delay will eventually cause you to lose the ability to fly. Eternal dependence on others for support is shameful. The fields and skies of the motherland are so boundless and vast. There, the sea is wide, and the sky is vast, and you can roam freely. There, tens of thousands of soldiers need your education, millions of people fighting for freedom need your organization and mobilization, millions of glorious and wounded civilian heroes need your comfort, and millions of victims who are willing to sacrifice need your arrangements. Send your loud songs to those who do not want to be slaves! Pour your broad knowledge into the minds of the masses and soldiers!</p>
<p>In the land of struggle, there are no vulgar and conventional cultural merchants, and no one needs false praise and flattery. The education there, everything there, is all coordinated with the progress of the war of resistance. Living there, you do not have the usual vulgar pleasures, but what you have is endless hardship and pain, yet also endless joy and elation.</p>
<p>Arise! Young teachers, from today on, put down your whips, shoulder your majestic rifles, and I wish you to grow strong in the flames of war!</p>
<h3 id="e74">Two Touching Stories <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Zhaoyun</p>
<p>This topic was brought to me by a comrade who had just returned from the front lines.</p>
<p>The first is about a messenger. On a battlefield in Hubei Province, a certain messenger received an order to deliver a confidential document to friendly forces. The distance between the two locations was about ten li, and the territory of the enemy soldiers lay in between.</p>
<p>He ran quickly, wading through water that reached his shins,穿　(chuān, pass through/wear) through deep forests. He thought only of two things: first, how could he complete the task in the fastest time? Second, how could he avoid the eyes and ears of the enemy soldiers? As he ran, he thought, but the thing he dreaded finally happened. A burst of gunfire struck his ears, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers ran toward him from afar. Our messenger quickly lay down and resisted bravely. His marksmanship was superb, and his tactics were excellent. Two or three bullets killed two or three enemy soldiers, and the others were frightened and dared not advance.</p>
<p>Although the first obstacle was overcome, the second obstacle came again. After traveling more than half the distance, he encountered the hateful enemy again. This time there were even more, more than a hundred! They seemed to know that the messenger was carrying something very important, so they surrounded him on all sides. They closed in without any relaxation, closing in, closing in! This brave soldier knew that there was no hope of breaking through the encirclement, so two more thoughts湧(yǒng, gush/surge) into his mind: first, how could he turn the "document" into ashes? Second, how could he kill a few more enemy soldiers in the final moment?</p>
<p>He quickly decided. He took a hand grenade from his waist, attached the "document" to the hand grenade, stood beside it, and pointed his gun at the enemy soldiers. One enemy soldier after another fell, but the soldiers behind finally surrounded him. The final moment had arrived. Our messenger fired a shot at the hand grenade. "Boom!" A deafening blast rang out. This final act killed himself, shattered the "document," and also took the lives of five enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>A foreign journalist who learned of this news said with great emotion: "China is truly a great China. She has produced countless brave soldiers. This supreme spirit is not only absent in Japan, but it is also difficult to find in the armies of other countries in the world!"</p>
<p>The second story is about a wounded soldier.</p>
<p>A green army truck drove from the front lines to the rear. Inside the truck lay twelve seriously wounded soldiers. Some had their legs blown off by artillery fire, and some had lost both legs and arms. At the rear of the truck was a door for entry and exit. A soldier with an injured left arm was sitting on the second step of the ladder. A snow-white bandage was wrapped around his shoulder and wrist, with fresh red blood seeping through. His　恪(gé, appearance) was very tall and large, and his broad shoulders rubbed against the edge of the door, blocking the way in and out. A group of battlefield慰勞(wèi láo, comfort/salute) teams and medical rescue teams were anxious to go inside to pull out the brothers who were groaning and waiting to be rescued, but this wounded soldier refused to give way. Some people stepped forward to explain to him, once, twice, but he ignored them! A thirteen-year-old child walked up to him very sincerely and said: "Uncle, you are injured! Can you not walk? Let me help you, okay?" As the child spoke, he used his small hand to help the injured soldier. The wounded soldier's face changed, and his eyes turned red, radiating a scarlet light, as if he wanted to eat someone. "Slap!" "Slap!" He slapped the child very　(hěn, very) hard twice. This was probably the greatest pain and insult this child had ever suffered since he came out of his mother's womb. But he held back his tears, walked forward with a smile, bowed deeply to the wounded soldier, and said very gently: "Uncle, we have worked so hard to come here, just to bring you comfort and warmth. Did my actions make you unhappy! Look, listen! There are many brothers inside the truck who are still dying. Because I want to save them to contribute to the motherland, that's why I offended you! Good friend, you are also injured, but you still have two legs to walk on. I'm afraid they can't even sit up! Uncle, I apologize to you, please don't hit me like that, if you do, I will be very sad." These words made the　兵(bīng, soldier) cry, cry loudly! He said in a trembling voice: "Please forgive me! I was wrong! I am a murderous demon. When I was a 'bandit,' I cut off fifteen bloody heads in one breath without shedding a single tear, but this time I was moved by a child, a Boy Scout!" He enthusiastically grabbed the child's small hand and said, "I am very sorry to you!"</p>
<p>The reporter said: "The great spirit of this child is enough to be a role model for us adults. If we want to save the country, we must first learn from these Boy Scouts. This little Boy Scout is a little hero of the nation!"</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Night at Lianjiangkou <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ding</p>
<p>To go from Shaoguan to the Qingyuan front line in Beijiang, one must first　(zhuài, drag) a car (both train and highway car are available) to Dakengkou, and then transfer to a small boat along the Beijiang River south. From north to south, it is downstream, probably taking one and a half days to reach Liming and Hengshi. If from south to north, it takes four or five days to return to Dakengkou.</p>
<p>This day, we hired a boat at Dakengkou at six o'clock in the morning, and arrived at Yingde County at two o'clock in the afternoon. After a short rest, we set off again at three o'clock, and arrived at Lianjiangkou at around six o'clock. The sun was setting, and dusk was spreading.</p>
<p>Lianjiangkou was originally a very small market, but travelers going south from Dakengkou stopped here, as if officials in the imperial era had to dismount here. They all had to rest here for the night before they could continue their journey the next day. Therefore, this place gradually became prosperous. However, since the County of Hua was occupied by the enemy, the few people who passed through here were mostly local villagers, and most were armed comrades on missions.</p>
<p>Two armed comrades were traveling with me. One was a company commander of the Artillery Corps of the ×th Division, and the other was also a company commander of the Infantry Corps of the ×th Division. They were temporary traveling companions whom I met by chance in Dakengkou in order to share a boat and save money. The infantry company commander was silent and spoke little; the other company commander loved to talk and laugh, and was very outgoing, which reduced the loneliness of the journey. When the boat had not yet arrived at Lianjiangkou, he was clamoring to stay at a hotel in Lianjiangkou that night and have a good time.</p>
<p>The market of Lianjiangkou is next to the river. Many of the buildings by the river are made of wood, looking like pigeon nests from afar, supported by high wooden pillars underneath. Leaning on the windows and doors of the buildings are some heavily made-up women in brightly colored clothes with unbuttoned collars, making it clear that they are the "angels" of the night—prostitutes. When our boat docked at the pier, it was almost dark. We hurriedly went ashore to find a hotel, opened a large room, and then went out to have dinner. At this time, it was not "ten thousand lights," but a dark street. Most of the shops had closed their doors, and only a few food stalls were lit with particularly bright gas lamps. The "angels" were walking back and forth on the street, in front of the food stalls, waiting for their masters.</p>
<p>It turned out that they were all singers who sang southern tunes, mostly around fifteen or sixteen years old. The signs of two or three shops read "XX Hotel", and pasted with 风楼(fēng lóu, literally wind tower, a euphemism for brothel) and 某　楼(mǒu lóu, certain tower) were their main bases. At first, when we went ashore, we did not know the situation and thought they were ordinary hotels.　We went upstairs to take a look, and it turned out that there was a large group of them, talking and laughing; we realized that we were wrong and hurried down. However, a certain company commander among us lingered there, looking left and right. When he went downstairs, he laughed loudly, saying, "It's very interesting, haha!"</p>
<p>After eating dinner at the restaurant, a certain company commander drank two glasses of white wine, and his face covered with　(mǎn, full) dense short whiskers looked particularly ruddy. He said he was going to visit a friend and left alone. The artillery company commander and I returned to the hotel, chatting about artillery life, and soon went to sleep.</p>
<p>Being cooped up in a small boat all day had been very tiring, but how could we sleep? Soon after falling asleep, a defense officer came to check the rooms. After checking, the next-door neighbor called a southern tune singer to come and "flirt and scold" [idiom for playful interaction], singing nonsense for half the night before she came down. But the company commander who went to "visit a friend" never returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>The next morning, we got up at six o'clock. Waiting until about seven o'clock, we still did not see him return. We all laughed and said it was a bit strange, and that something must have happened. We ran to the street to eat porridge, just passing by the "Double Wind Tower". Someone was carrying water inside, and the person who opened the door was a 南　(nán, southern) singer wearing a dotted long shirt, sleepy-eyed and not yet dressed. We tried shouting loudly upstairs:</p>
<p>"Commander ×!" Sure enough, a reply came from upstairs immediately:</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm here!"</p>
<p>We laughed loudly. Commander × was wearing his undershirt and opened the upstairs window to greet us,</p>
<p>"The boat is leaving, if you don't come down, we will leave first!"</p>
<p>"No, wait for me, I'll be right there!" He was anxiously threatened by us.</p>
<p>We went back to the boat first and waited for a while before he leisurely came. We asked:</p>
<p>"Was it sweet last night?" He replied with a smile:</p>
<p>"Not bad! I'll have to come and taste it again next time I pass by here."</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Heat Burned My Chest <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Qingfeng</p>
<p>The flames of war illuminate the vast blue sky,</p>
<p>The sound of cannons shakes the wide expanse,</p>
<p>My blood boils, my heart races,</p>
<p>The heat forged my chest;</p>
<p>Rushing to Han Qing to go,</p>
<p>Carrying endless pain,</p>
<p>Throwing a tough body,</p>
<p>Into a hard and beautiful farm.</p>
<p>Under the rustic sunlight,</p>
<p>Gleaming, the dark and oily skin of the farmers,</p>
<p>Glaring with round eyes;</p>
<p>If the poisonous claws of ×× had not stretched into our country,</p>
<p>Our lives would not be so积　(jī, stagnant),</p>
<p>The anger in my heart will never disappear,</p>
<p>The rage burns on.</p>
<p>The rage burns on,</p>
<p>Hoe after hoe,</p>
<p>耙(bà) and 犁(lí) [farm tools for plowing],</p>
<p>Using the firepower of brave 械(xiè, weaponry),</p>
<p>Towards the Han wilderness,</p>
<p>An eruption of private revenge.</p>
<p>Every hot spark,</p>
<p>Burns every cell in my body,</p>
<p>My flesh swells with gasps,</p>
<p>Bursting forth,</p>
<p>Releasing a bold song,</p>
<p>Like the powerful roar on the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Section Chief <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yingchuang</p>
<p>This section chief was someone I visited when I passed through ×× because of work development and handling procedures. Originally, we were looking for the county magistrate. Later, we learned that the section chief was also in charge of this matter, and he was also the head of the Anti-Enemy Association's Propaganda Work Group.</p>
<p>We ran to the county government three times before we were told: that was not a place to visit, especially for us. Later, due to　(zhēn, true) our child-like sincere visit, we were allowed to see us in the Propaganda Work Group leader’s office!</p>
<p>There was only one "group member" in the Propaganda Work Group, tidying up miscellaneous tasks. Zhong and Hua and I waited from two o'clock to four o'clock. A newspaper had already been　(sàn, scattered) ripped and torn, then we saw the section chief walk in with a short cane. He wasn’t very tall, and his face was like one of the Four Heavenly Kings in a large temple. He was wearing a well-tailored Western suit. As soon as he sat down, he kept pulling at the few　　(xiū, whiskers) whiskers growing under his mouth, looking very formidable, as if he couldn’t have expressed his esteemed position without doing so.</p>
<p>"You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?" he said faintly.</p>
<p>"Not really　(ba, a particle implying doubt), only two hours," Zhong said mischievously.</p>
<p>"Hmm... where are you from?" He didn't seem to pay attention to our situation.</p>
<p>"We came from our occupied hometown — Xiamen," I replied.</p>
<p>"Hmm, so you're a small refugee team!" he said with some emotion.</p>
<p>"But we want to continue doing national salvation work. So we don't want to be refugees with our parents, to be subservient citizens!" Li said somewhat unconvinced.</p>
<p>"But who do you rely on for a living?" He fiercely pulled out a whisker.</p>
<p>"Hmm, we use work to gain people's sympathy. We eat thanks to the enlightened officials and dear compatriots everywhere. We sleep on the ground all the way, wear straw sandals, and even seven-year-old comrades run seventy or eighty li!" …</p>
<p>"Isn't this kind of life very hard?" he said impatiently.</p>
<p>"No, our slogan is to endure hardship and overcome difficulties; in this great era, not only must we endure hardship, but we must also seek out hardship!" Li continued to explain.</p>
<p>"I think you are so young, you should go back and live with your parents and study hard," he said somewhat pityingly.</p>
<p>"Who wants to go back and study the books of slaves? … But we know that national reconstruction is needed after the war of resistance, and we are also needed, so I always try to educate myself in exile! We use mutual assistance and collective research to study various issues in the war of resistance," Hua said with outward passion, but with some anger inside.</p>
<p>"There is also research, so you must know about communism.一(Yī, one) He thought　(xiē, some) that these children were too advanced, so he hurriedly asked. Suddenly, he urgently asked, "Tell me: what is communism?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, we know that it is a group of people who support the war of resistance and work hard to kill　(dí, enemy)."</p>
<p>"Just these single paper?" He asked again cautiously, "Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's all we know."</p>
<p>"Hmm…" he muttered for a moment: "I'll tell you: now we only have one doctrine... the Three Principles of the People. Violating it is destroying the war of resistance, and that's being a traitor! So you have to work hard to implement it, understand?"</p>
<p>"What the section chief said is correct. We also know that the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is national independence, civil rights and freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. Therefore, we follow our example to discuss any unreasonable places for the people and officials, according to this to that, so that everyone can understand and cooperate with each other!"</p>
<p>He felt a bit of a headache, so he cast a glance at the　(shàng, up) the ceiling. Although there was no wall clock, he pretended, "Time's up, I have official business!" After he finished, he took his cane and left without even turning his head.</p>
<p>We sighed helplessly and moved on to our goal. When we were in the secretary-general's reception room, the section chief was already shouting loudly over there, precisely because of us.</p>
