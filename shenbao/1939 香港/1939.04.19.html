<h3>中日戰爭側面觀　日俘森下九郎被感化後所書之感想　軍政部第一俘虜收　容所所長汪大捷譯</h3>
<p>俘虜森下九郞，年二十七歲，原籍日本廣島，畢業於廣島一中，民二十六充南滿鐵道社員後選爲所謂，『北支派遣軍官撫宮』，在河北省元氏縣，實施挑撥煽惑之所謂宣撫，于客歲五月又在升贊皇縣充宣撫班長，七月二十二日赴縣南，距城僅十餘里，即被我別動隊捕獲，至徐樂村彼雖頑强不屈，但于中國之優待，深表謝忱，對中國軍民之忠勇尤爲欽佩，客臘至此仍本其宣　之伎倆，每談必辯，雄辯至十餘次之多，彼發謬論，我則以中日間之事實與眞理，分析辨止，促其反省自覺，每至辭窮，彼必俯首沈思，似有所悟，然後正容稱『是』，一日彼云『中國新政府』，純係民意，與日本無關，……余笑亦言，曰是否民意，我不如汝所知之詳，汝以爲與日本無關，惟不知旣係民意，何用宣撫，旣與日本無關，何爲君等日人作此宣撫工作耶？彼當時舉措失常，鼓掌狂笑，自此大悟，此次戰爭爲日本之侵略政策『僞組織』，乃日閥之卑劣行爲，而中國則本五千年來之和平思想，人道精神，爲爭民族生存，爲求人類幸幅之正義戰。是中日間是非曲直，×己自判，其他關于戰場之實况，日軍兵力不足，反處被襲之境，我國軍民一致，全體同心，鬥志益堅，戰力愈强，論事論理，最後勝利，非我孰歸？茲譯森下九郞所書中日戰爭之側面觀，及吿日本民衆書兩文，以示　受感化後思想之一斑。</p>
<p>中日戰爭勃興以來，已一年有半，其間中日兩國皆消耗大多數之軍費，犧牲幾十萬之英靈，今尙終日流血，而此後　續此悲慘之戰爭，究幾何年，猶難逆料。</p>
<p>社會最大之罪惡，人類可憎之鬥爭，何以未能避免？况交戰兩國同爲黃種人，同爲東亞民族，以東亞之兩大獨立國雄立于世界，而又均大聲疾呼，爲求東洋之眞正和平乎？</p>
<p>豈欲維持此兩國所大聲疾呼之眞正東洋和平，釀成此眞正東洋和平、如不以鬥爭解决之，其不可得乎？吾敢斷言，有中國始有日本，無中國卽無日本，惟有兩國間保持無上之親善，此眞正和平，始可維繫而保持之。</p>
<p>若然，此次中日戰爭，何以竟未能以外交手段解决之耶，茲欲探求其原因，作我之感想。</p>
<p>如據中日兩國各自之聲明，問其不法射擊，究係何故？卽率然曰，此次事變之發端，只在乎蘆溝橋事件，此種解釋，自不得不謂爲過于輕率，過於膚淺</p>
<p>然則此種原因，果如日本之聲明，在乎抗日，排日，抑防共乎，尤是不然，吾寧謂帝國軍部所正吶喊之大陸政策，換言之，卽使亞細亞打成一片，而帝國欲作其盟主之野心，爲其主因，乃屬至當。</p>
<p>證諸事實，中國雖提倡抗日，果曾排日乎，欲論此點，必先囘憶此四十年之歴史，而考究之始可。</p>
<p>當甲午戰爭中國失敗，喪失領土，喪失國權，進而一般民衆，皆于諸外國之壓迫中生活，于某種意義下，自由已被繩縛，而『滿洲事變』勃發，其失地益見擴大，國權益損，於此中國民衆對於日本之感情，乃日益惡劣。</p>
<p>雖然，而中國政府，須能把握住提倡國權平等，自由解放之民衆，依停戰協定，嚴守規約，且務使其能圓滿實行，但日本則不然，猶復興兵入境當冀東政府設立之時，蔑視中國一切國權，干涉中國所有政治，只因其有此種種之行爲，始產生抗日產生排日至中國共產黨之所以擴大，其原動力如謂爲因中國國權之不平等，復受種種之壓追，或屬定論。</p>
<p>如此論之，則帝國所破口大喊之抗日及共產黨云云，究竟係出于中國國民乎，曰非也，謂爲日本自身所釀成之者，非過論也。</p>
<p>進言之，帝國屢次聲明，「毫無領土野心」之言，果誠意乎？</p>
<p>試觀現在之「滿洲國」可以知之。</p>
<p>有帝政，雖定國是而其實權皆置諸帝國政府之勢力下，名爲產業開發，實爲武裝移民，只爲努力於自國權益之擴大而已。</p>
<p>有以上之事實，非侵略戰爭，其何謂耶？今日正　使全中國，爲第二次之「滿洲國」，得謂無領土野心乎？據以上種種判斷，中日戰爭之原因，究孰是熟非，不言可知矣。</p>
<p>中日戰爭進展，日軍攻下漢口，認爲吿一階段，而中國則將入其所期之目的「長　抗戰」。</p>
<p>事變發生以來，兩國均一貫的不以民衆爲敵，而以軍閥爲敵，各欲打倒之，然則此謂軍閥云者，抑究誰指，試先看日本軍閥，正在發揮其軍之威力，壓迫民衆，而千涉中國之政治，于此發生出一種要求，衆××自尊心，此心一定，遂欺騙民衆，擾亂和平，興起戰爭之矛盾現象。請看日本軍閱之盛衰史，可知每當其軍之威力衰退，則必惹起戰爭，雖陷人民於戰禍之苦，亦毫不之顧，只圖軍閣自身權益之擴大，不能不謂爲徒自肥已。</p>
<p>囘顧中國軍閥時代，或因領土過于廣大，亦未可知，總之，數十年來，曾于一個統治者之下，未治全土，國內各地割據，軍閥互爭，而人民卽受此軍閥之統治。</p>
<p>對此，自古及今，國內一般民衆，素愛和平，因其重文輕武之念重，故軍閥常受其感化，而其勢力亦只可視要保持和平，維持和平之具耳。</p>
<p>此所以世界各國皆稱中國爲「睡獅國』，一亦和平，二亦和平，總之酷袋和平，爲人道主義而戰，且不止亂世之今日，雖卽將來，亦必能本此精神，蒸蒸日進。</p>
<p>綜觀前述，中國軍閥，雖曾散在各地，不受中央政府之指揮，而此次事變勃興以來中國全土，無不受領袖蔣介石之統帥者，而國民亦均於擁護蔣委目長與中央政府之旗幟下爲國奔馳，使中國五千年之歷史，煥然一新，終形成一個政府，一個領袖之統一國家。</p>
<p>如此以觀，一此次日本之行動，對于中個，　爲革新過去之惡者，一幸事，亦無不可！</p>
<p>次則請看已經一年有半之戰線現况</p>
<p>日本報紙宣傳，自事變發生以來，「皇軍」以破竹之勢連攻要地，連克要地，以之壓迫中國全士之領海權，更進而將所佔領地城之各交通線及其附近要地，皆劃爲日軍勢力範圍，負其警備之任，然而實際，是否果如日本報紙之所發表？日軍所佔之地域，皆屬日軍之勢力範圍，殊不知於此戰線過於擴大之現况下，日軍兵力實覺不足，費九牛二虎之力，只能守備侵佔地域之縣城內及鐵道沿線而已，而中國現在指揮全軍游擊戰術，遍於全國，故雖已被日軍侵佔之區，除鐵道沿線，其他廣大之地域仍爲中國軍之勢力範圍，於此長期抗戰之現况下，中國軍隊已使駐屯佔領域之日軍，反處於被攻擊之立場，且此飽受戰禍之區，深苦無恢復治安之術而醉心勝利的日軍之行動，卽殺人，强奪，燒屋等等之橫暴行爲，使中國民衆目睹，進而被逐出鄕，父母妻子失散，使其對×國日本，各下憤怒之心，以爲如不益加强化，努力抗戰，則其自國必至滅亡，因此，確實產生軍民一致之　精神，於不知不覺中，抗戰意識，卽益形濃厚，益形鞏固。</p>
<p>如繼續展開此有利之長期抗戰，則處於相反立場之日軍，縱國民皆兵，　因此長期作戰，則軍部之大錯誤錯亦必暴露，欺騙民衆之事實，亦必暴　，而成爲軍民離心離德之動機·軍隊自身之戰鬥力，亦必滅退。是則此後於山岳戰與　擊戰間，即招非常之困難，可以斷言僅以前述，作淺學菲才之感想。</p>
<p>諸位，現在中日戰爭，正向長期演變着。</p>
<p>住在日本國內的諸位，每天看到報紙，和聽到電台放送，全部是日軍以破竹之勢，攻略中國，而所佔之域地，已全歸日軍之手，治安完全恢復，中國民衆又皆崇敬日軍，討厭以前的中央政府，而以新成立「中國新政府的國民，敬天喜地的成家立業，更以　日軍將南京，徐州，漢口與中國之要塌互相繼攻下，戰爭已府勝利，旣然如此，何以戰爭終不結束？對此種種量必懷疑而莫明其妙吧！</p>
<p>其內幕，原因，雖不一而足，而最顯著者，首因日本之新聞，廣播，雜誌，及所有日本之宣博機關，皆受日本軍部之統制壓迫，不使發表　變之眞象，常以充滿虛僞之宣傳，欺騙諸位，，因此車　所發表之事實，與戰場所表現之事實竟至　全不同！</p>
<p>如以上情形，諸位對於中國，實在缺少認識，調識不足。</p>
<p>試舉例述之，現在日本政府方面，不承認中國的中央政府。</p>
<p>但此只有日本政吋時，出此行爲，至于其他諸外國，仍皆承認以前的中國政府，此外日本軍部所說的「中國新政府』斷斷乎不是由於民意所組成者，實乃日本軍部所援助而成者，往坯去說，在日本之「支配」下，換言之，卽在强權勢力之下，無法無度，强迫而組織之者。</p>
<p>其證據，則爲日本現所佔領與駐屯之地域，無論何地，到處設有所謂「宣撫班」之宣傳機關，極力傳播「中國新政府」之政綱政策，拚命收買中國民衆之歡心。</p>
<p>試思此「新政府」如確係中國民衆之眞意所組成者，則此等宣傳工作有何必要？且日軍所佔領之地域，關于治安等等，早當完全恢復，又誰知現在的戰線，已展佈中國全土，日軍佔領的地域謂日軍之勢力範圍，只不過平漢鐵道及其附近之縣城內而已，且必以九牛二虎之力，始得守備之。</p>
<p>因爲除鐵道又縣城內，其他廣大之地域，全部屬于中國軍之勢力範圍，且常常攻　各地守備之日軍。</p>
<p>如此說來，其原動力究在何處，乃吾人所不可不知者。</p>
<p>此無他卽中國民衆，自始至終擁護中央政府，而對日軍之侵略，採取敵對行爲，因此所謂「中國新政府一之只不過日軍之片面的，虛僞的一種宣傳而已，毫無如何實力。</p>
<p>再者，中國民衆自身，房屋被燒，父母妻子離散，甚而各不相知，轉流於他鄉，令其崇敬日軍，寧可得乎。</p>
<p>今如立場轉變，使日本國內展開最痛恨，萬惡的戰禍，如現在中國領土內之現象，諸位將作何想！</p>
<p>不是只有對侵略者，多增反感與×愾心嗎？前列事實，雖以普通人之常識也能判斷吧！</p>
<p>現在已入長期抗戰的階段。</p>
<p>但此非日車所能長短之者，實因中國政府之戰策如此，實因中國民衆之總意如此，始釀成此長期戰抗。</p>
<p>然而中國五千年來，同以和平爲國本。一貫至今，故此番事變，亦非中國之所欲十亦非中國之所發起者，只不過對侵略者所忍無可忍，奮然而起之應戰抗戰而已，且中國之敵人，又决非無罪無惡的諸位——日本民衆，——乃社會人類之破壞者——日本軍閥——興支持軍閥之後台老板——日本財閥。</p>
<p>若此可憎之鬥爭，長期下去，諸位。你覺得好嗎？</p>
<p>諸位不要喊什麽『勝利　利的，」更應當對於此次事變，眞實的想一想，確切的批判批判。</p>
<p>那傷幾十萬的良民，增加幾十億的國僓，而其鬥爭結果，所餘何事？除父母失散，子女傷亡，而妻子流離於道路外，還有什麽好處呢？</p>
<p>再看看中國的戰况如何。</p>
<p>雖云古今東西皆有戰場之遺跡，但以「昭和文明」時代，發生此事，你們認爲好嗎？</p>
<p>使祖先遺留的田園荒蕪，幾萬的財富，一朝而成燼灰，他如房屋被焚，里莫留，父母妻子死傷別　，以社會人類言，是應有的事嗎？以人生言，是當行之道嗎？</p>
<p>如果想象想到戰禍之後，有如此悲　的事實，現請目前，誰能不反對此最可憎惡之戰爭呢？</p>
<p>中國現在，軍民一致，縱化全國爲焦土，亦必打倒日本軍閥，然與無罪的諸位——日本民衆——，共同携手，建設將來眞止的東洋永遠和平！總之，此次事變之日本一日不停止其侵略行動，中國一日不斷止抗戰！不但如此，中國人民除日見增加，日見鞏固其抗戰意識外，別無他事。</p>
<p>如斯思之，皇統連，我二千六百年之歷史，稱雄於世界的日本帝國，將蹈征服歐洲全土，不可一世之英豪，拿破崙之覆輒，亦未可知。</p>
<p>戰爭之勝負，不在武力，其最後勝利端在民意。</p>
<p>想到戰爭之裏面，有多數涕哭的民衆，對於一人類愛，仍不惻然醢覺者還有嗎？</p>
<p>總之，除非日本軍關反省覺悟，別無他途。</p>
<p>以上爲我個人對此次事變感想之一端，謹以奉吿。</p>
<p>此外關於戰場之眞象，如只以老于事政之常識　度，無論如何其想像不到之處，亦復多多，故　同胞萬勿惑於新聞，雜　，及電影等之宣傳，當各竭眞誠，對此次事變，切實批判，而後定一自）處之道吧！</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>祝全國基督教大學教育會議</h3>
<p>全國基督敎大學敎育會議，業於前日起在港舉行，來港出席者計有燕京，聖約翰，東吳，滬江，之江，協和，華南女子文理學院，嶺南，齊魯，金陵，金陵女孑文理學院，華西等十二大學校長敎授等。抗戰以來，全國基督敎各大學，或遭×機轟炸，校址慘被摧毀；或受×軍蹂躪，不能進行敎務；然各大學當局，均能於困苦危險之中，維護大學敎育的神聖事業，或仍在淪陷區內，艱苦支持，有如北平燕京大學；或選入安全地區，繼續辦理，有如金陵，金女文理，齋魯及華西等校。基督敎各大學當局此種不懼一切艱苦而努力作育國家人材的精神，不僅爲基督敎的光榮，同時還應受全中華民族的敬禮。</p>
<p>現在全國基督敎大學在本港舉行教育會議，其最重要的任務，當然是要檢討全國基督教大學教育的現狀，參玫我國最近第三次全國敎育會議的决議案與宣言，而研究今後維護教育改進敎育的方針和辦法，解抉目前基督敎大學敎育所遇到的種種困難問題。我們鑒子基督敎各大學在全國大學敎育所處重要的地位，我們鑒於目前基督教各大學所遇嚴重的困難，除了熱烈祝望出席此次會議的校長敎授諸君獲得美滿的成果之外，謹願以輿論界的責任，敬献蒭議，以備參攷：</p>
<p>首先，我們祈望全國基督敎大學會議在討論議案時，能够把握住當前敎育的中心問題，卽是要以基督不妥協不屈服的犧牲救世的偉大精神，以全副的熱情和眞誠，負起作育英才救國建國的責任。出席此會的繆秋笙博士前日談稱，基督敎敎育方針，在於『敎育自由』，他還說：『教育如能遵照中央政府所定的敎育方針辦理，則繼續進行』，這種方針與决心，是至可欽敬的。基督教的信徒蔣委員長，最近昭示第三次全國敎育會議說：『要以革命救國的三民主義爲我國敎育的最高基準，實施抗戰建國綱領，創造現代國家的新生。現代國家的新生力，由敎育經濟武力三個要素所搆成，敎育是一切事業的基本』。又說，『要由種種艱苦困難的當中，造成我們中國的富有活氣富有前途的現代國家』，我們希望這次會議始終不忘這幾句訓詞，進而求其貫澈。</p>
<p>其次，我們最關懷的，是×人侵佔區域，×人後方，和戰區內的敎育事業。因爲在那裏，我們還留着無數要求國家正常的敎育的靑年，而×人則已在推行各褻凟敎育的奴化工作，這是人間最慘酷的事態！祇有期望我們基督敎育家，發揮大無畏的精神，以更大的努力與奮鬥，一面與一切從事戰區×後救國建國的敎育家取得聯繫，一面與一切×人傀儡政權的暴令威脅，作堅靭的機巧的鬥爭。出席這次會議的繆秋笙博士談稱：基督敎今後敎育方針還要『使敎職員及學生生命得以保障』，這種不畏强暴維護敎育尊嚴與安全的决心，至可敬佩。我們更期望這次大會，决定更具體更有效的辦法，爲我國家民族保存元氣，爲社會爲人類培植眞理的衛士。</p>
<p>此外我們熱烈期望於全國基督敎大學敎育會議的，還有兩點：第一是在此祖國危難敎育困苦的現狀之下，要爲敎育與文化盡更多更大的力量：如適應當前一切需要，參酌各地實際情形，領導學生。擴大圖書舘設備，推進民衆敎育，增設戰時講座，訓練抗戰建國的技術人才，努力各種戰時服務工作，以及誠意推行國民精神總動員，協助各地靑年學生的救亡運動等等。第二是密切與國外基督敎敎育界的聯繫，宣傳日本侵華的×行和我國敎育界靑年界爲人類正義與和平而浴血抗戰的情形，獲取國際對我國道義上物質上的更大的同情援助。</p>
<p>在此國家存亡呼吸的抗戰期間，我們對於出席此次會議的各大學校畏與敎授諸君，更切風雨同舟之感！諸君所主持的大學，在戰區，在淪陷區，在遼遠的後方，過去已有艱苦奮鬥的成績，今後處境未必即能轉好，責任則將益加鉅重，我們於感激期望之餘，惟有祈祝諸君秉諸基督偉大的精神，不重當前的酬報，而期待我中華全民族抗戰建國成功與世界和平實現以後所將献給諸君的精神上的安慰！我們以此敬祝諸君的健康，我們更以此敬祝全國基督敎大學敎育會議的成功！</p>

<h3>發動全民族力量　蔣總裁廣播訓詞　昭示精神總動員偉大意義　務於下月一日起全部實施</h3>
<p>（續咋日本報第三版）其次，要問我們從抗戰以來，在精神上是不是已經有積極的發揮和進步？是不是還有多少的缺點？說到這一層，我要回我們同胞提一句，一年多以前的舊話。這還在我們抗戰開始不到兩三個月的時候，　時國外興論對我國有各種不同的批評，中間有一句極其怵目驚心的評語：『中國在精神上或物質上，都不够抵禦外力。』我不知道我們同胞，還記不記得起這一句話，我個人却是把這一句話夭天記在心頭，自警自勵，沒有一刻忘却？這一句話是小是對于我們的一種侮辱，是要待將來以事實來證明的。固然，我們在抗戰中間，已經表現了不少英勇奮鬥的事蹟，但是同胞們要記着，戰爭還沒有結束，×人還沒有擊退，最後勝利，還沒有實現；我們要坦白切實的自己檢討一下，我們國民的精神，跟着戰時的進行，果眞有確實的進步嗎？我們過去的缺點，已經召抗戰中間洗滌淨盡了嗎？我們有職責的人，已經盡了責任嗎？有能力的人，巳經盡了能力嗎？我們每一個人的生活，已經一致地嚴肅緊張了嗎？我們前方後方，已經確　做到呼應一體，休戚共同了嗎？我們的思想言論行動。巳經完全集到『國家至上，民挨至上　和軍事第一，勝利第一』的目標之下嗎？我們每一个人所言和所行，已經做到表裏一致了嗎？我們慷慨熱烈的抗戰氣概，個個人都能始終如一夷險一致地貫澈到底了嗎？我們能絕對的不搖，不奪，不欺，不偽嗎？再則我們對于抗戰建國的信心，能够使每一个國民都接受都領悟了嗎？我們能使×人和一般傀儡漢奸，認識我們民族精神不可侮的力量了嗎？我們一般社會的生活形態，是已經切實做到戰時生活的條件了嗎？我知道有良心的同胞想一想自身，再看一看自身周圍的社會，必然覺得我們有格外警惕，格外振作。格外互省勉勵督實的必要了！一個國家物質上有缺陷，一時沒有法子充足，不能就作爲　個國家的恥辱；因爲物質的生產，要有人力物力，尤其是時間種種條件，不是頃刻之間，可以補充的。至于精神上的缺陷，就不同了！有了精神，一份的物質，可以當作十分的物質來使用；而且能創造出多量的物質；沒有精神，就像總理所說「人身的體就成爲死物」，憑你有怎樣多的武器和物質，也一概歸于無用！而且精神不比物質，神精是每一國民所本來具有的，不是身外的，是可以用啓發感應的方法，在一念轉移之間，去改進和提高的。一個國家，如果因精神的衰徵，而遭受外來的侵略，已經是這一代國民無比的恥辱；如果到了危急存亡的時候，還不能集中我們的精神，家喻戶曉，父詔兄勉地來保衛國族，渡過當前的艱危，開闢未來的命運，那不僅是這一代國民的恥辱，簡直是一種罪惡！因爲，這是所謂一非不能也，是不爲也」，是沒有理由可以自恕的！要知道，我們　戰勝利，建國成功，中華民族幾千年的國運，就不會斷絕；我們也一定有把握，可以建立起一個三民主義的新中國，反之，如果國家竟因我們這一代沒有蓬蓬勃勃堅持不屈的精神，而喪失了獨立生存，那麽後來史家紀載我們這一時期的歷史時，將不知是怎樣嚴厲的貶斥！我們一般國民，固然要蒙受百世的責備，而知識能力地位較高的各界領袖和智識份子，將更小能逃避史家的責備！現在抗戰進入第二期了，這是我們最後勝利的機會，也是我們國民最後報國自贖的機會，我所以在軍事政治十分繁忙之中，提倡國民精神總動員，就是要給我們同胞，尤其各界領袖，最後報效國家的一個機會。精神總，動員所包括的項目，綱領裏面已經列舉了幾點，也有綱領裏面所不及列舉的，大家可以推類旁通；爲使得這個動員普遍推行，所以首先定出舉行國民月會和宜誓國民公約的辦法。大家舉行時候，切不可以奉行故事的方法來做；要知道，這簡單的十一條　就是我們抗戰却×的　器，是要我們有不怕死，不怕苦，不怕難的精神，去貫澈的。譬如我們說，不替×人和漢妤做工作，如果遇到有什慶武力來脅迫我們的時候，我們就祗　拚命，不肯　誓，又如我們說，不違背三民主義，不違背國家民族利益，如果有什麼外來的威逼或引誘，要我們違背三民主義，做一件違背國家民族利益的事情，我們也應當咬定牙關，寧死不肯背誓，受盡任何痛苦，也不肯背誓。我們今天的情形，可以說明已經　入到快要翻身的光榮綫上，而每一個國民，都要自認爲站在必死的綫上，正像古人說「存心時時可死，行事步步求生」。我們的一舉一動，一滴汗，一滴血，隨時隨地都要用來求國家民族光榮獨立的生存。但我們憑什麽來奮鬥呢？就是我們個人有决死的决心。如果個個人，都有時時可死的决心，無疑地，×人將要在我們的面前崩潰，中華民族高尙的精神，就可以普遍奮發，來達到抗戰必勝和建國必成！關于精神總動員的要義，我所要說的話，一時實在說不盡，上面所舉的宣誓一節。乃是基本要義的所在。我痛切要求我們每一個同胞，守定「國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中，力量集中，的共同目標，切實恢復我們民埃固有的道德，加強我們精神的堡壘，每一人要爲國家盡思。爲民族盡孝，爲痛苦同胞盡仁愛，對一切的人和事重信義，還要盡一切的奮鬥力量。在這個粉擾黯淡的世界中，求取眞實永久的和平我更要求我們同胞，大家明瞭抗戰就是爲建國吶件大責任，要併作一起來完成，所以必須痛切　悔過去不能眞切信仰三民主義的錯誤，從今伊始，要確立我們三民主義的建國信仰，失忠矢誡，求其實現。最基本的一點，是要我們同胞，自老年壯年，以至于靑年，一致對于民　光明的前途，有熱烈的自信；我們要確認抗戰勝利以後所建立三民主義的中華民國，一定是一個後來居上的新國家，是眞正的民有，民治，民享，而且足以貢獻于世界人類　祉的最澈底進歩的國家。現在是抗戰劇烈千金一刻的時期，不容我們冉作任何的空論空想，小容我們荒廢一分的光陰和精力，我們應該準對當前的強×，正視國家的艱危嚴重，反省我們的責任，切實檢討我們一切缺點相弱點；一方面迅速確實的來改造自身，以身作則，　時提摯着我們全國的同胞，幫助我　還沒有覺悟的同胞，喚起我們一般知識水準較低的同泡，一致奮起，改正醉生夢死自暴自棄的生活，養成奮發逢勃積極進取的朝氣革除苟且偷生陽奉陰違的習性，打破自私自利投降屈服的企圖，糾正紛歧錯雜誤國自誤的思想，緊張我們的情緒，統一我們的行動，使我們中華民族的精神，充實起來，集中起來，眞止做到舉國一致的精神總動員，發揮道一個至大至剛的精神力量，來完成我們這一輩繼往開來千載一時的使命，我們親愛的全國同胞，望大家爲國奮鬥，爲國珍重，再會！</p>

<h3>南非洲的神秘政治家</h3>
<p>— 之遣譯</p>
<p>這位南非洲萬年國防大臣畢羅奧斯渥特·由於他的去年十一月經由歐洲各國首都的旅行，而引起了這　多的關於非洲舊德屬殖民地前途之猜測的，究竟　何等樣人呢？自從畢羅先生以一言震動了全世界以來，爲時還　有幾多月，他的話是這樣說的：</p>
<p>『大不列顛的統治階級，贊同和的『除非設法補　德國所失去的殖民地，否則對德關係永遠　法建築在和平相處的基礎之上』的主張。而此種補償，又衹能求之于非洲。要維持白種人在非洲大陸的統治地位，最重要的莫過於在非洲和德國相合作了，這一點，我可以說權威方面是同意於我的』。</p>
<p>這個宜言，顯然是畢羅先生奮鬥的最高峯。接着他又有另外一個最　的宣言說：</p>
<p>「我很高興看到將來德國重還到非洲來，因爲祇有納粹是知道怎樣對待土人的」。</p>
<p>畢紙·奧斯渥特以脫蘭斯瓦爾共和黨領袖之一，而開始其政治生涯。在一九二九年，他是赫柴將軍的政府中最年輕的內閣閣員。後來，被任爲鐵道海港部長，在此任內，他充分的顯示其組織者的才能，這時，國有鐵道和海港的財務情形是非常的壤，畢羅改組了內部的組織，而把差不多年有虧耗的一變而爲有　餘了。</p>
<p>他希望升遷而獲如願以償。一躍而爲國防大臣，</p>
<p>一個卓絕的演說家和政治陰謀家，他現在是南非洲突出人物之一了。他們知道和大衆相接觸的價值。他駕着自已的飛機，駛着自己的汽車，有一次昨到土人在德爾班地方示威，他就飛到那邊，自居警察首腦的地位，領導着進攻的隊伍，以流淚彈驅散了羣集的土人。當羣衆聽够了關於他所殺死的獅子以及其他勦續等種種把戲而覺得厭煩時，他的興趣便轉移到國際政治方面。畢羅爲辯正其上述的話起見，竟宜稱凡是擁有非洲殖民地的國家，都應該轉讓一部份給德國。這是最公平的事，而他的意思，亦祗如此而已。據一般推測，他是特別指安哥拉，哈麥隆說的。</p>
<p>現在呢，畢羅把他的親德的態度，比較的保藏起來了，而以其大部份的力量　注於改　南非防務方面。我們容再把他對威廉斯脫萊斯的友誼態度合併考慮時，便不禁要問：『畢羅所欲求的究竟是什麽』？一位著名的南非洲前任大臣對此疑問曾經回答說、『這憫答案並不複雜我們的國防大臣有極大的野心、他的最大的願望，便是想做首相，所以他是同時騎了兩匹馬，向兩面奔馳，他強調着德國的殖民地要求，宜揚着那黑禍的　論。但爲了獲得不列顛的選舉票，並表示其效忠於英格蘭起見，他又鼓吹着成立國防組織，創立南非戰時工業』。</p>
<p>但是，無論畢羅的野心是怎樣，他對於南非聯邦的防務，的確有極大的貢獻。　改　了足以成爲大治金工業基礎的以　爾諸工塲，此項冶金工業，其現模之大，足以使　多南非洲人相信這個區域的冶金廠不久就可以成爲英國軍事工業的中心。</p>

<h3>快樂天使（四）</h3>
<p>她忽然非常的得意、『啊、范先生……你要請我』、</p>
<p>哈立退縮了一下、『不要　出這副神氣、我只是因爲要報答你今晚胡鬧的一點好心、我想請你喝　咖啡』、</p>
<p>『你倒很客氣、』她動人的笑起來、『我眞是很榮幸、能和你一全去上餐館』、</p>
<p>『你等看見了那餐館再說吧』、</p>
<p>那是一個叫　園的希腦飯館、他們各人叫了一點食物、</p>
<p>『你吃這點就够了嗎、乖乖』、哈立看她叫的東西很少、</p>
<p>『啊、我等一會可以再叫的、不過、我的名字不是叫做乖乖、我叫　琳』、</p>
<p>『這沒有多大關係、我對每個人都叫她們乖乖的』、</p>
<p>『或者、就內爲這樣、我才要抗議』、她說時、忽然顯得很驕傲、『我不是每個人』、</p>
<p>『啊、萬分抱歉、你的斥責、我是罪有應得』、</p>
<p>『我』、愛琳笑了、織手撫着他的手臂、表示寬恕、『我并不是斥責你。哈立、』</p>
<p>『這就行了、』他冷然的應着。『我也并沒有多大的難堪。』</p>
<p>這時、他們叫的食物送來了、愛琳低着頭、一面吃、一面輕輕的說、『哈立、我能全學會那些暗號、』</p>
<p>『你是這樣想嗎？』他不信的說、『那是一個很深奧、複雜的玩意呢、』</p>
<p>『我能學會它、我們能合作得很好　、將來、我能看見、倫敦街上、用霓虹燈做着我的名字、愛琳——偉大的愛琳——哈立范配演』、</p>
<p>『你在嘴上倒佔了點便宜、』</p>
<p>『你也會喜歡倫敦的、』愛琳的眼裏　着光明『當我幼年從蘇聯逃出來的時候、啊、那眞是種特別的經歷、范先生、給我一定要說你聽、』</p>
<p>『好的、好的、』哈立點着頭、『但是、我們明天還有四次表演、并且、你是要跳舞的、也該好好的睡睡吧、』</p>
<p>正在這時、有人將收音機轉動、播出了一隻歌曲、</p>
<p>『聽、』愛林輕柔的說、『你知道這集歌曲嗎、這是一隻俄　歌、』叫做『一夕之歡』、她的意思是說、有兩個人、在一夕良辰迅見了、相愛了、頃刻間又分散了。啊、多可愛的音樂、它把我帶回到老遠的冰天雪地的聖彼得堡去了、』她跟着音樂哼着、哈立迷惑的望着她、在身她有一種神奇的誘力、是他以前所遇見過的女子所沒有的、</p>
<p>『啊、多美麗的故事、』她輕輕的咕着、她的眼裏放着光彩、注視着哈立、她的嘴唇徵徵的分開、哈立感覺到週身的血液迅速的流動起來、情勢是這樣的緊張、他趕快付了帳、催着愛林走了出來、到了戲院的宿舍　他向　道了晚安、讓她先上樓去、因爲、他想避免和她全在一架自動電梯裏上樓、</p>
<p>十分鐘之後、他也上了樓、走近他的房門時、他忽然驚異起來、因爲、他房裏有着燈光、他沒有敲門就衝了進去、愛琳在裏面、坐在桌子後面、穿着地的浴衣、眼睛上紮着他的一隻襪子、他三腳兩步的竄過去、奪下了一隻襪子、</p>
<p>『誰允許你的、將我最好的襪子紮在頭上、並且、你怎樣跑進來的』、</p>
<p>『這地方每張門的鑰匙都是一樣的、』她求恕的朝他望着、</p>
<p>『好、』他虎視着她、『現在你又要些什麽、』</p>
<p>『請你教給我那些暗號、哈立、』</p>
<p>『不行、』他兇很的說、但是當他朝她看着時、他覺得自己不够強悍了、一他不能　她定出去、她使他柔弱起來、以前、後來沒有過一個女子能使他這樣、對於哈立范、女子們都是蠢貨、</p>

<h3>乙組足球聯賽亞軍　在九龍會塲決戰　米杜息對五營砲兵今日下午四時開賽</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】足球總會所舉辦各項錦標賽、依次結東者已有督憲杯、麗華杯、特別銀牌、及國際杯、而此四項錦標、俱爲我華隊所得、且有全數包辦之趨勢、若得成事實、誠光榮之至、</p>
<p>刻下已屆球事闌珊之候、惟甲組聯賽錦標問題、尙有待於南華與及海軍作最後决戰、方定誰是盟主、至此關係重要之一役、巳改定本月廿二日下午四時半在海軍場舉行</p>
<p>乙組聯賽、自南華最後一戰而克士葛、逐榮登首席、惟亞軍問題、因米杜息與五營炮兵積分相等、尙須舉行決賽、方可定奪、</p>
<p>此幕亞軍決賽、今日下午四時在九龍會場舉行、兩隊對此、甚爲重視、蓋亞軍亦是光榮物、牛黃狗寶、同足珍貴、不能不力爭也、</p>
<p>日前、組銀牌決賽時、米軍各員表演平庸、尤以防衛爲弱、遂被士葛擊敗、屈居亞軍、今日米軍登場人物、相信與銀牌賽時略同、以應付五營　兵、恐爲易得勝、惟兩隊寶力相差不遠、劇爭必不免也、錄乙組全部成績表如下、（球塲太歲）</p>

<h3>大林珍雄風猶在　林添德甘拜下風　林病後氣虧連敗兩盤　今日雙打準決賽何李組對林珍兄弟</h3>
<p>【本報專訓】公開草地網球賽、昨天午後、大林珍戰林添德于香港木球會場、大林珍馳譽球壇、十有餘載、邁因年　漸長、英勇已減當年、然其富有經騐、仍不失爲　老手、林則年富力強、朝氣篷勃、且曾淘汰宿將芬查、給人印象甚深、故未開賽前、一般觀客都以爲林有戰勝大林珍之可能、豈料接　之下、大林珍勇氣猶存、發揮盡致、林在其控制之下、竟直落二盤、望風披靡、蓋大林珍之抽擊遠劈、均能運用自如、上網迎擊、亦多　手、加以林氏病後、氣力大差、故於　付之下、難免一敗、首盤時、林尙能鎮靜從事、屢還顏色、所失無多、惟第二盤大林珍抽擊得宜、攻勢甚盛、林至是體力消失、陷於絕境、迨相持至二比三局時、大林珍抽擊更烈、林乃抵抗不來、大勢遂去、連負四局、總結果四比六、二比六敗續、</p>
<h3>昨戰概況</h3>
<p>開賽後、大林珍聲勢煊赫、連下兩局、至是林氏抖擻精神、鋒茫漸露、左右底綫撇擊、迭次建功、大林珍鑑於林氏苦苦趕來、亦不敢大　、或而上網壓擊、或而底線力抽、花樣多端、總比林氏『獨沽一味』之底綿長撇、來得精伶巧妙、而其手段高強、於此可見、故盡量發揮之下、以六比四、先勝首盤、</p>
<p>第二盤大林珍乘先勝之威、更演出得心應手、且林氏病後出迎勁敵、已是吃虧、故應戰之下、力與心違、雖曾一度打成二比三之局、頗爲緊張、無奈經騐尙新、殊多破綻、迭被大林珍所困、應付之術漸窮、氣力亦復不繼、演來茫無頭緒、乃又以二此六再敗、至是此位少年戰士、在單打中之命運、遂吿一段落矣、</p>
<p>大林珍　勝　林添德</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>六比二</p>
<p>今日比賽</p>
<p>今日有雙打單决賽一場舉行、爲何家流李汝榮對林珍兄弟、何李曾于去週擊敗強勁之德孚皮亞士、聲威甚大、惟林珍兄弟、稱霸島上巳十餘年、曾蟬聯雙打冠軍至八屆之久、迨前屆因徐家軍脫穎而出、始將寶座拱讓出來、屈居亞軍、然其兄弟合作即慣、打法爽辣、刻下捨家軍外、尙無足以攖其鋒者、故何李實力雖不弱、惟與林珍兄弟相較、實覺遜色、亦難免一敗、然料接戰之下、定多精彩演出也、</p>

<p>按、南圻A隊爲越南唯一雄師、去年來港比賽之本貢隊、有過半隊員、乃該隊之台柱、本年二月間南華隊南遊、亦曾被該隊所敗、其實力之強、概可想見、此次東方勞師遠征、遭此重創、誠開我華隊前此征貢所未有之慘敗紀錄、錄東方出　戰續如下、</p>

<p>一般人的習慣、在就寢後幾分鐘、或晨早睡醒之後、都會胡思亂想的、無論好的事情、或者壞的事情、也會不斷的繼續想着、有時想得過步、逐致不能入眠、或早晨時不願意起床、凡　這不良的習慣時、對于身心兩方的影　、都非常重大、若要免除這個弊　、絕對不是用強制的方法或自己用　知的方法、來制裁得有　、任憑你的理智如何的高上、目制的　力怎樣偉大、而所得到的效能也很少的、唯有根本的或嚴有效的辦法、就是用正當的　慣去替代它、所謂正當的習慣、一方面是依時睡眠和按時起床、第　方面、就是在就腰時和起床前、有實行床上健身操的習慣、如能够養成進行這種健身習慣之後、對于身心、或事業上都會得到很人的幇助、不過還有一件事要注意的、便是有習的　慣、大家都要有互心去實行這　運動、絕對不能有小小的間斷、這樣耐久的幹下去、目然地可以從身、或事業上發、他的功效、惟所得的利益多少、必與努力的糸數成正比例、必不有例外、現將最有效的幾個健身操介紹如下、</p>

<h3>急變</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>「嗡—」一飛機停不的在頭頂的天空裏盤旋。不時還有「轟！轟！」的炸彈聲，接着是房屋的倒坍聲，亂烘烘地。</p>
<p>大家不安地打徇窠似的被窩裏爬出來，擠到門口，爭着那五寸見方的小洞向外望。甬道裏，黑暗暗，陰沉沉的，連平時呼么喝六的獄丁們，也不知全溜到那兒去了。</p>
<p>『人呢—人呢—王八蛋！爬到那個烏龜洞裏去了啊！往日呼么喝六的，全是你們的世界，現在可溜了嗎？媽的！』强盜犯阿徐猛烈地擂着門。</p>
<p>『聽狗二（獄丁）說，這幾天外面打得很兇，離開這要不遠呢！怎麽好！」竊犯王阿萬獨自憂慮地說着。</p>
<p>『嗡——轟—轟—』飛機又在拋炸彈了。</p>
<p>『阿彌陀佛，作彈生眼睛，不要下在這裏呀！饒我這條老狗命吧！唉！唉！』販土犯施老四哭聲地說，說畢又把頭蒙在被頭中去了。</p>
<p>『要炸就炸死你這種幹殺人不見血勾當的賊種—俺阿徐明槍交戰，爽爽快快地，白刀子進，紅刀子出！要死就死，你有這種氣？烏！』阿徐狠狠地說。</p>
<p>『我死，看你不死。唉唉！一施老四　出被窩，却又縮了進去。</p>
<p>『你說！你說！我先打死你再說。』阿徐要趕過去動手，却給王阿才同另一個竊犯馬新根拉住了。</p>
<p>『你老哥何苦跟這老頭兒爭吵！』王阿才勸着阿徐，又囘過頭對馬新根說道：『狗二還說上頭要把我們釋放呢！』</p>
<p>『俺不怕死！不過要死麽就得死得爽快，跟鬼子拚，死了也有面子，要呌俺糊裏糊塗的給鬼子兵炸死在牢裏，叫俺用什麽話來交代閻王，還有我那狠天狠地的爺老子？」阿徐自語着，接着它自擂着門，罵道：『王八蛋！開門呀！』</p>
<p>忽然甬道裏傳來一陣匆迫的脚步聲。阿徐打洞裏望出去，看見狗二領頭，後面跟着七八個兵，走過來了。不覺破口大罵道：『王八蛋！你來了啊！我當你在烏龜洞裏　死了呀！開門，讓俺去跟鬼子拚！」說畢又猛烈地擂着門。</p>
<p>『別閙：別閙！典獄長來了就放你們這班狗！』</p>
<p>狗二這句話說得很饗，差不多間間囚房都淸楚了。囚徒們眞樂得合不上嘴巴！大家忙着，急着。</p>
<p>一會兒，典獄長來了。狗二，陳良才等獄丁，還有十多個兵。</p>
<p>『三十四號，十七名；三十五號，十六合；三十六……」典獄長照着簿子唸，狗二開鏈鎖，陳良才點人。</p>
<p>千多名囚犯，把整個甬道都擠滿了，典獄長站在出口處的一隻凳上，大聲說道：「外面戰事很緊迫，×人離開這裏不遠了，我奉得命令放你們！你們在這裏，有的是十年二十年，有的是三年五年，大家都能循規蹈矩的過着。國家待你們也不薄，現在放你們出去，望你們出獄後，能够改過自新，不要再犯罪作惡！要做一個好人！要對得起國家和你們的祖宗！好啦！你們走吧、出門時不要擠，不要亂，不要擠在一起，×人的飛機　見了要拋炸彈的！</p>
<p>呀！千多個從心田裏發出來的歡呼，接着大家就開始移動脚了，正在這時，阿徐搶上一步，大聲說道：</p>
<p>「慢啦慢些！俺阿徐也有幾句說：俺阿徐從前是做强盜的！黑的槍，白的刀，紅的血，俺都玩過。俺要死，幾十次也死過了！可是現俺在仍舊活着。俺在這裏坐了十三個年頭了，幾片瓦，幾塊磚，俺都背得出。國家養俺十三年，待俺不薄。從前，俺們最對不起國家！現在，俺們要拿什麼來報答我們的國家，俺們的老家給鬼子們毀了，田地變成了荒丘，妻女給姦，還有什麽家！俺們就跟鬼不們拚了命吧！殺一個，够本。殺一變，賺一個！有種的跟俺阿徐走！」</p>
<p>有我的！有咱的！還有我！我！幾百個鐵一般的洪聲。</p>
<p>阿徐領頭，後面是幾百個壯士，一支鐵隊伍一條鐵的洪流，出獄去了！</p>
<h3>大麥郊之夜</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>汾水西岸行軍記</p>
<p>夜又去了，繁密的炮火落在我們心上；隔着一座山，我們等着戰爭。</p>
<p>從早晨到中午，一直和×人保持着接觸；炮火猛烈地飛到山中上來，我們留了一小部分人在山上牽制着×的主力，不時用快槍向山下的公路上射擊；翻過一重山，我們的主力便伏×人後面了。凛冽的寒風，帶着血腥和火藥味流過戰場。</p>
<p>萬山環抱的晉西的重鎭，萎縮地，疲倦地伏在山脚下，連一聲喘息也沒有了。</p>
<p>這是西線上的一個支點，被×人佔領已經兩天了。</p>
<p>人們可以想像到的凄凉，在這里，不能引起任何人凄凉的感念了。人顏的悲劇，並不是死；我們並不爲死而歎息，悲嗟；人類的悲劇，是當心靈深處的仇恨被發掘的時候，而不能找着他們的仇人；在遙遠的地方，仇×逍遙着……</p>
<p>當我看到那些受難者的時候（我們的同胞和被日本法西斯强盜所迫來到自己的祖國進行瘋狂的屠殺的東北同胞）。我想着，這是人類的悲劇啊！</p>
<p>深夜，我由那裏囘來，從死屍身邊走過；殘月掛在亂山中，山市靜寂無聲；我忽然記起宋人『鬼哭但餘殘月在。村焚無復隻鷄留』的詩句。</p>
<p>×人連留下來的麵粉，豬肉，……做了我們一頓豐盛的晚餐。</p>
<p>「有毒的，不要吃吧！」我阻止着他們。</p>
<p>褚肉的香味，惡作劇地糾紛着我。終於我自己也貪婪地吃起來了。</p>
<h3>漫談三原色五彩片</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>三原色五彩影片的發明，是聲片盛行之後，電影史上的一大革命。最近在上海公映的「比翼雙飛」，是米髙梅的第一部三原色五彩片；同時，聽說蘇聯第一部三原色五彩影片『夜鶯」，也不久在上海公映。在這裏，筆者要把三原色彩片的種種情形寫在下面以作讀者。</p>
<p>現在的五彩影片，在彩色上和以前的影片比較起來是不同了，現在的比較要進步得多。主要的原因就是以前的彩片用兩種原色攝成，三原色片於一九三二年發明，經過好多人的悉心研究才獲得成功的</p>
<p>所謂天然色片，事實上也就是三原色片，如果要嚴格的分一個界限，那麼天然色片是三原色片中的一部而已。就是利用天然的外景，攝成五彩影片，一花一草的在銀幕上　出其彩色和天然的色調沒有絲毫的兩樣。如果攝純粹的天然色片，鏡頭完全在戶外拍攝，那宋導演的工作便要輕鬆得多，爲的佈景是不需要了。三原色片發明而後，先把迭斯耐的米老鼠影片作爲嘗試，因爲米老鼠片部是短片，就是嘗試失敗，損失也比較小，那知嘗試結果，竟獲得莫大的成功，從此一般的電影觀衆對米老鼠黑白片就覺得平淡無味，結果使米老鼠畫片非彩色不可。到了最近米老鼠長篇五彩片『白雪公主』的攝製更是三原片卡通的一大成就，三原色彩片用米老鼠畫中嘗試成功而後，好萊塢的各影片公司就開始注意這種彩片起來，凡是劇本的故事，題材，適於攝製三原色五彩影片者，都用彩色攝製，在我們的記憶上「浮華世界」，「松嶺恩仇記」，「雷夢娜」，「白雪公主」，這幾部影片的成功，在彩色方面的收穫，是很大的。</p>
<p>現在各國一般的影片公司，也都從事攝製這種新型的彩色片了，不過事實上同樣一部影片，攝三原色彩片，成本方面，要比黑白片髙過不少，這是物質條件的限制。因此，三原色彩片自發明到現在，已有七八個年頭，我們在電影院裏，還是難得看到一部，不像聲片，發明而後，隔得不久，就無片不聲了。</p>
<h3>創造者的路</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我們在艱難中，走一段辛苦的途程。</p>
<p>沒有路，沒有界碑，沒有平舖的靑石，沒有登山的階梯。途程是遙遠而且辛苦的啊！不看我們的頭上已垂垂汗下，手足也胼胝了麼？人類應有的機智，熱誠和果敢，給我們預支了，全副體力，我們也運用來作雄獅的掙扎。</p>
<p>跋涉過一條長的途程，一整天，一整夜，一重水，一重關山，跟着我們的脚跟，造成迢號的「康莊」。</p>
<p>我們跨度過縣屋，我們攀登過絕　，我們曾盤紆過九曲的羊腸，我們曾披斬過深林中的伏莽，我們在黄天寓里中尋覓過水源，我們在壁立千導的鳥道上俯聽過驚風。我們經歷過許多險艱，一切畏懼看來是漢爲，神奇看來是平凡了。生命史上塗滿偉大與壯烈，我們的身體，髙與天齊，掘動鋤鍬。整齊步伍，讓我們的汗一粒粒滴落在身上，讓我們以辛苦換上一條平坦的「康壯」。</p>
<p>不有艱難，那會有歡笑？跋涉過一條長長的途程，一整天，一整夜，一重水，一重關山，亂石牽絆了步履，荊榛刺破了脚趾，泥沼濘污了衣裳，憔悴於大漠的風沙，困躓於夜來的狼虎，一壁蹣跚，顚仆於險阻的路途，一壁還給我們以後的行人開拓出平坦的道路。確然我們的工作是艱辛呵。但，這算什麽呢？我們每人都有一個去處，我們度越過平原，還須爬上那高可接天的山峯。在山之巓，途程之終點，那見有一所幸福的「樂園」，於此我們享受自由的空氣，解脫痛苦的枷鎖，恢復長期的疲勞。</p>
<p>從原始來，這途程一直不曾被人開拓過。一個旅人常因不能耐瘴癘的蠻煙，或無力格殺毒蛇猛獸，悄悄地安息在地下，暴露白骨於大荒，膽怯的乃視爲「畏途」，雖然明知道有幸福的山巓，但終無勇氣度過這重重險阻。</p>
<p>於是『畏途』乃成爲豺狼奔突的世界，弱肉委於强食，温良委于貪暴。</p>
<p>幾千年後，幾禺年後，輪着我們今天來走這艱難的途程了。不懶惰，不沮喪，不屈服，不討饒，挺起腰幹，把握鋤犁，開拓一條平坦的道路，給我們自己，給我們子孫，也給我們朋友。</p>
<p>途程是遙遠而且辛苦的啊！沒有路，沒有界碑，沒有平鋪的靑石，沒有豋山的階梯。從邪惡中，我們創造出正義；從自然中，我們刻劃下鬼斧與神工。</p>
<p>不愁失落的岐途。看那山巓已與眉齊。樂園亦可在望。不用嘵嘵罷。祗須盡你最後一點力，你便已登上山巓。</p>
<p>跟着我們的脚步。迢遞「康壯」造成了，退向身後，度越過平原，也攀登上山峯。</p>
<p>『艱辛的旅行人，也是光榮的創造者啊！」</p>
<p>後世旅人將指點『康莊』，感謝他奮鬥的前代了。</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>這些話，給她的反應，是平常的安慰；但給同志的感覺，却完全是茫然，神秘。因此，在同志中，難免有人這機想：</p>
<p>『你愛了她嗎？愛得太快，愛是難够長久的。』或是：</p>
<p>『愛是自由的』但你不能放縱它而妨害工作！』</p>
<p>在他把自己和她的一切經過吿訴同志以後，他們還疑心不是事買，而是近乎故意造成的離奇的故事，但從她那種默認中，却不能不使他們相信了。於是，他們都向他施以贊揚的眼色，贊揚着他意外的成功。這對於她，正是反面——意外的失敗；怨恨嗎？遲了，哭了；弱者的流淚，常是安慰自己的。她這安慰，反而惹起他的憂慮來，爲了使她安心，把她引進另一房間——隔壁的一間，除去壁門以外，再無第二屋門；如果外出的時候，必須通過　門，和壁外的那一房間。伹窗子很多，高大而寬闊，並且是雙層玻璃；其間，有一尺還多的距離，放着避寒的鋸屑和棉花——上面，還有黑炭和紅花。窗項，垂落着紫絨的窗幕；這窗幕，可以遮住屋中的一切秘密。窗和窗間的兩處，爲了投合房客不同的個性，主人掛了兩幅不相調協的名畫：『最後的晚餐』和『晚鐘』。此外，一個貴族姑娘所愛的用具，設備相當齊全，比如：彈性的小床，穿衣的長鏡，舒適的沙發和圈椅。最不可缺少的梳粧台……還有點綴人們空虛靈魂的瓶中幾束鮮艷的花朶！啟示人，誘惑人以靑春的理想的，夢幻的，或是供給憂鬱者而消愁的，或足陪伴孤獨者而破除寂寞的，他把她引到這花前，他說：</p>
<p>『這是寫你買的。』</p>
<p>然後，他又把花摘下一朶，揷在她的發髮絲中間；她用手重新篼一個位置，她說：</p>
<p>『這花眞好看』。</p>

<h3>A Sideways View of the Sino-Japanese War: Reflections Written by Japanese Prisoner of War Kuro Morishita After Being Influenced, Translated by Wang Dajie, Director of the First Prisoner of War Camp, Ministry of Military and Political Affairs</h3>
<p>Prisoner Kuro Morishita is 27 years old, originally from Hiroshima, Japan. He graduated from Hiroshima Ichikou High School. In 1937, he became an employee of the South Manchuria Railway and was then selected as a so-called "Officer Consolation Palace of the North China Expeditionary Army." In Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, he carried out so-called pacification work, stirring up trouble and instigating discord. In May of last year, he became the head of the pacification squad in Zanhuang County. On July 22, he went to the south of the county, only a dozen or so li from the city, and was captured by our commando unit. Even in Xule Village, he remained stubborn and unyielding, but he expressed deep gratitude for China's preferential treatment and admired the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese military and civilians. Last winter, even here, he still used his pacification skills, arguing whenever he spoke, debating more than a dozen times. When he uttered fallacies, we analyzed and refuted them with facts and truths about China and Japan, urging him to reflect and become aware. Every time he ran out of arguments, he would bow his head and ponder, as if realizing something, and then solemnly say, "Yes." One day, he said that the "New Chinese Government" was purely the will of the people and had nothing to do with Japan… I smiled and said, "Whether it is the will of the people or not, I don't know as well as you do. You think it has nothing to do with Japan, but I don't know why you need to pacify it if it is the will of the people. If it has nothing to do with Japan, why are you Japanese doing this pacification work?" At that time, he acted abnormally, clapping and laughing wildly, and then he greatly realized that this war was an "artificial organization" of Japan's aggressive policy and a despicable act of the Japanese financial clique, while China, based on the peaceful thought and humanitarian spirit of five thousand years, was fighting a just war for national survival and human happiness. He can now judge for himself who is right and who is wrong between China and Japan. In other matters, regarding the actual situation on the battlefield, the Japanese army is short of troops and is often ambushed. Our military and civilians are united and of one heart, our fighting spirit is stronger, and our combat power is greater. In reasoning and logic, final victory must belong to us. Now, I am translating Morishita Kuro's "A Sideways View of the Sino-Japanese War" and "A Letter to the Japanese People" to show a glimpse of his thoughts after being influenced.</p>
<p>It has been a year and a half since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. During this time, both China and Japan have spent most of their military expenses and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of heroic souls. Now, they are still shedding blood every day, and it is difficult to predict how many years this tragic war will continue.</p>
<p>Why has it not been possible to avoid the greatest crime of society and the hateful struggle of mankind? Moreover, the warring countries are both yellow people and East Asian nations, standing tall in the world as two major independent countries in East Asia, and both are loudly calling for true peace in the East.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to resolve this true East Asian peace, which both countries are loudly calling for, through struggle? I dare to say that Japan exists because of China, and Japan would not exist without China. Only by maintaining the utmost friendship between the two countries can this true peace be maintained and preserved.</p>
<p>If so, why was this Sino-Japanese War not resolved through diplomatic means? Now, I want to explore the reasons and express my thoughts.</p>
<p>According to the respective statements of China and Japan, when asked about the illegal shooting, what was the reason? They simply say that the beginning of this incident was only the Lugouqiao Incident. This kind of explanation must be said to be too hasty and too superficial.</p>
<p>Then, is this reason, as Japan claims, due to anti-Japanese sentiment, anti-Japanese activities, or anti-communism? This is even less likely. I would rather say that the main reason is the continental policy that the Imperial military is shouting about, in other words, the ambition of the Empire to unite Asia and be its leader.</p>
<p>Judging from the facts, although China advocates anti-Japanese sentiment, has it ever engaged in anti-Japanese activities? To discuss this point, we must first recall the history of the past forty years and examine it.</p>
<p>When China failed in the Sino-Japanese War, it lost territory and national rights. Furthermore, the general public lived under the oppression of foreign countries. In a certain sense, freedom had been bound. When the "Manchurian Incident" broke out, the lost land became even larger, and national rights were further damaged. In this situation, the feelings of the Chinese people toward Japan became increasingly worse.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese government must be able to grasp the people who advocate national rights equality and freedom liberation, strictly abide by the armistice agreement, and ensure its full implementation. However, Japan is not like this. It still sends troops into the country. When the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established, it disregarded all of China's national rights and interfered in all of China's politics. Only because it had these kinds of actions did anti-Japanese sentiment and anti-Japanese activities arise. The driving force behind the expansion of the Chinese Communist Party is due to the inequality of China's national rights and the various forms of oppression it suffered.</p>
<p>Thus, the anti-Japanese and Communist Party claims that the Empire has been shouting about, are they ultimately from the Chinese people? No, they are not. It is no exaggeration to say that they were caused by Japan itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, does the Empire's repeated statement that it "has no territorial ambitions" come from sincerity?</p>
<p>We can know this by looking at the current "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>Although there is an imperial government that determines national policy, its actual power is all placed under the influence of the Imperial government. It is called industrial development, but it is actually armed immigration, only striving to expand its own national rights and interests.</p>
<p>With the above facts, what is this if not a war of aggression? Today, it is making the whole of China into a second "Manchukuo." Can it be said that it has no territorial ambitions? Based on the above judgments, it is clear who is right and who is wrong in the cause of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>As the Sino-Japanese War progressed, the Japanese army captured Hankou, considering it the end of a stage, while China will enter its intended goal of "protracted resistance."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the incident, both countries have consistently not taken the people as enemies, but the warlords as enemies, and each wants to defeat them. Then, who are these so-called warlords? Let's first look at the Japanese warlords, who are exerting their military power, oppressing the people, and interfering in China's politics. This has given rise to a kind of demand, the self-respect of the masses. Once this heart is determined, it deceives the people, disrupts peace, and creates the contradictory phenomenon of war. Please look at the history of the rise and fall of the Japanese military. You can see that whenever the power of the military declines, it will inevitably provoke war. Even if it plunges the people into the suffering of war, it does not care at all, only seeking to expand the power and interests of the military itself, which cannot but be said to be purely for self-enrichment.</p>
<p>Looking back at the era of Chinese warlords, perhaps because the territory was too large, it is also unknown. In short, for decades, the entire territory had never been ruled under one ruler. Various parts of the country were divided, and warlords competed with each other, and the people were subjected to the rule of these warlords.</p>
<p>In contrast, the general public in the country has always loved peace, from ancient times to the present. Because of their emphasis on literature and disdain for martial arts, the warlords are often influenced by them, and their power can only be regarded as a means to maintain peace.</p>
<p>This is why the world calls China the "sleeping lion." First, peace, second, peace. In short, they are extremely fond of peace and fight for humanitarianism. Not only in today's troubled times, but also in the future, they will be able to base themselves on this spirit and make steady progress.</p>
<p>Looking at the foregoing, although the Chinese warlords were scattered in various places and not under the command of the central government, since the outbreak of this incident, the entire territory of China has been under the command of leader Chiang Kai-shek, and the people have also been running for the country under the banner of supporting Chairman Chiang and the central government, making China's five thousand years of history焕然one new, and finally forming a unified country with one government and one leader.</p>
<p>From this point of view, this action of Japan's is actually a lucky thing for China, in that it is reforming the evils of the past!</p>
<p>Next, please look at the current situation on the battle line, which has been going on for a year and a half.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers publicize that since the outbreak of the incident, the "Imperial Army" has been attacking key areas in China with irresistible force, continuously conquering key areas, and using this to oppress the entire Chinese territory. Furthermore, all transportation lines in the occupied territories and their nearby key areas have been designated as Japanese military sphere of influence, responsible for their security. However, in reality, is it really as the Japanese newspapers have published? All the areas occupied by the Japanese army are within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army. Little does it know that in the current situation where the battle line is too large, the Japanese army feels that its troops are actually insufficient. It takes a lot of effort to only defend the county towns and railway lines in the occupied areas. However, China is now commanding guerrilla tactics throughout the country. Therefore, although the areas have been occupied by the Japanese army, except for the railway lines, the other vast areas are still within the sphere of influence of the Chinese army. In this current situation of protracted resistance, the Chinese army has made the Japanese army stationed in the occupied areas in a position of being attacked. Moreover, this area, which is deeply suffering from the ravages of war, is deeply troubled by the lack of means to restore law and order. The actions of the Japanese army, which is obsessed with victory, such as killing, looting, burning houses, etc., make the Chinese people witness this and are driven out of their villages, and their parents, wives, and children are scattered, causing them to have angry hearts towards Japan, thinking that if they do not further strengthen and strive for resistance, their country will inevitably perish. Therefore, the spirit of unity between the military and the civilians has indeed been produced. Unconsciously, the consciousness of resistance has become more and more intense and consolidated.</p>
<p>If this advantageous protracted resistance continues to unfold, then the Japanese army, which is in the opposite position, even if all the people are soldiers, and therefore this long-term war, the big mistake of the military will also be exposed, and the fact that it has deceived the people will also be exposed, and it will become the motive for the separation of the military and the civilians. The combat effectiveness of the army itself will also decline. Therefore, it can be asserted that very great difficulties will be encountered in mountain warfare and surprise attacks from then on.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the current Sino-Japanese War is developing in the long term.</p>
<p>You who live in Japan see newspapers and hear radio broadcasts every day. All of them say that the Japanese army is conquering China with irresistible force, and the areas that have been occupied have all been taken by the Japanese army. Public security has been completely restored, and the Chinese people all respect the Japanese army and hate the former central government. The people of the newly established "New Chinese Government" are happily starting families and establishing businesses, and the Japanese army has successively conquered Nanjing, Xuzhou, Hankou, and other important cities in China. The war has already been won. Since this is the case, why does the war never end? You must have doubts and be baffled by these things!</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, but the most obvious is that the Japanese news, broadcasting, magazines, and all Japanese propaganda organs are all under the control and oppression of the Japanese military. They are not allowed to publish the true situation of the incident and often use false propaganda to deceive you. Therefore, the facts published by newspapers and radio are completely different from the facts on the battlefield!</p>
<p>As in the above situation, you really lack knowledge of China and your knowledge is insufficient.</p>
<p>For example, the current Japanese government does not recognize China's central government.</p>
<p>However, this is only the behavior of the Japanese government. As for other foreign countries, they still recognize the former Chinese government. In addition, the "New Chinese Government" said by the Japanese military is definitely not formed by the will of the people, but is supported by the Japanese military. To put it bluntly, it is under the "control" of Japan, in other words, it is forced to organize it under the power of force.</p>
<p>The evidence is that wherever Japan now occupies and stations troops, there are so-called "Pacification Squads" and propaganda organs everywhere, vigorously propagating the political program and policies of the "New Chinese Government" and desperately trying to win the hearts of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Think about it, if this "New Government" is indeed formed by the true will of the Chinese people, then what is the necessity of this kind of propaganda work? Moreover, in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, the public security, etc., should have been completely restored long ago. Who knows that the current battle line has spread throughout China, and the areas occupied by the Japanese army, which are said to be the sphere of influence of the Japanese army, are only the Pinghan Railway and the county towns in its vicinity, and it takes a lot of effort to defend them.</p>
<p>Because, except for the railway and the county towns, the other vast areas all belong to the sphere of influence of the Chinese army, and they often attack the Japanese army stationed in various places.</p>
<p>If this is the case, where is its driving force? This is what we must know.</p>
<p>This is none other than the fact that the Chinese people, from beginning to end, support the central government and take hostile actions against the Japanese army's invasion. Therefore, the so-called "New Chinese Government" is only a one-sided, false propaganda of the Japanese army and has no strength whatsoever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese people themselves have their houses burned, their parents, wives, and children separated, and even not knowing each other, turning to other places. How can they respect the Japanese army?</p>
<p>Now, if the situation is reversed and the most hated and evil war is launched in Japan, like the phenomenon in China's territory now, what will you think!</p>
<p>Wouldn't there only be more resentment and hatred towards the invaders? Even with the common sense of ordinary people, the facts listed above can be judged!</p>
<p>Now it has entered the stage of protracted resistance.</p>
<p>However, this is not something that Japan can decide, but it is actually because the Chinese government's war strategy is like this, and it is actually because the general will of the Chinese people is like this that this protracted resistance has been created.</p>
<p>However, China has regarded peace as the foundation of the country for five thousand years. It has been consistent to this day. Therefore, this incident was not what China wanted, nor was it initiated by China. It was only a desperate response to the invaders. Moreover, China's enemies are definitely not the innocent you - the Japanese people - but the destroyers of society and mankind - the Japanese warlords - and the backstage bosses who support the warlords - the Japanese chaebols.</p>
<p>If this hateful struggle continues in the long term, will you be happy?</p>
<p>You should not shout "Victory" or "Victory". You should think about this incident truthfully and criticize it carefully.</p>
<p>What is left as a result of the struggle that injures hundreds of thousands of good people and increases national debts by several billion? Besides the separation of parents, the death of children, and the displacement of wives on the road, what other benefits are there?</p>
<p>Then look at the war situation in China.</p>
<p>Although there are traces of battlefields in ancient and modern times, east and west, do you think it is good for this to happen in the "Showa civilization" era?</p>
<p>Making the fields left by our ancestors barren, and tens of thousands of fortunes turned to ashes in one morning, such as houses being burned, nothing left, and parents, wives, and children dying, is it something that should exist in society and humanity? Is it a way to go in life?</p>
<p>If you imagine such tragic facts after the war, who can not oppose this most hateful war right now?</p>
<p>China now, with the military and civilians united, even if the whole country is scorched earth, will certainly defeat the Japanese warlords, but will work together with the innocent you - the Japanese people - to build a truly peaceful East for the future! In short, China will not stop resisting as long as Japan does not stop its aggression in this incident! Not only that, but the Chinese people will only increase and consolidate their awareness of resistance.</p>
<p>Thinking in this way, the Japanese Empire, which has dominated the world for 2,600 years, may also follow in the footsteps of Napoleon, who conquered the entire European continent and was invincible.</p>
<p>The victory or defeat of a war does not depend on military force, and its final victory lies in the will of the people.</p>
<p>Thinking of the inside of the war, there are many crying people. Is there anyone who is not moved by the love of mankind?</p>
<p>In short, unless the Japanese military reflects and becomes aware, there is no other way.</p>
<p>The above is one aspect of my personal thoughts on this incident, and I respectfully inform you of it.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the true situation on the battlefield, even if you use your common sense of being old in politics, there are many things that you cannot imagine. Therefore, compatriots must not be deceived by the propaganda of newspapers, magazines, and movies, etc. Each of you should do your best to be sincere, criticize this incident thoroughly, and then determine a way to deal with yourself!</p>

<h3>Congratulating the National Christian University Education Conference</h3>
<p>The National Christian University Education Conference began in Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Attendees from Beijing, St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, Zhijiang, Union, South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Lingnan, Cheeloo, Ginling, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and West China Union University attended. Since the War of Resistance, national Christian universities have either been bombed by aircraft, their campuses destroyed; or ravaged by the army, unable to carry out educational affairs; however, the university authorities have been able to maintain the sacred cause of university education amidst hardship and danger. Some are still supporting it hard in the occupied areas, such as Yenching University in Beiping; others have selected safe areas to continue running, such as Ginling, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Cheeloo, and West China Union University. This spirit of not fearing all hardships and striving to cultivate national talents by the authorities of Christian universities is not only the glory of Christianity, but also deserves the respect of the entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Now that the National Christian Universities are holding an education conference in Hong Kong, its most important task is of course to review the current situation of Christian university education across the country, refer to the resolutions and declarations of my country's recent Third National Education Conference, and study the future direction and methods of maintaining and improving education, and solving the various difficult problems currently encountered by Christian university education. We, in view of the important position of Christian universities in national university education, and the serious difficulties currently encountered by Christian universities, in addition to warmly wishing the principals and professors attending this meeting to achieve satisfactory results, would like to offer our humble advice as the responsibility of the media for reference:</p>
<p>First of all, we hope that the National Christian University Conference will be able to grasp the central issue of current education when discussing the agenda, that is, to take the great spirit of sacrifice and salvation of Christ, who does not compromise and does not succumb, and to take the responsibility of cultivating talents to save the country and build the country with full enthusiasm and sincerity. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended this meeting, stated the day before yesterday that the educational policy of Christianity lies in "educational freedom." He also said: "If education can be carried out in accordance with the educational policy set by the central government, it will continue," This policy and determination are most admirable. Chairman Chiang, a Christian believer, recently declared to the Third National Education Conference: "We must take the Three People's Principles of revolutionary salvation as the highest standard of education in our country, implement the program of resisting Japan and building the country, and create the rebirth of a modern country. The new force of a modern country is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." He also said, "We must create a modern country in China that is rich in vitality and has a promising future in the midst of various hardships and difficulties." We hope that this conference will never forget these teachings and seek to implement them thoroughly.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we are most concerned about is the educational cause in the areas occupied by the [Japanese] invaders, the rear areas of the [Japanese] and the war zones. Because there, we still have countless young people who demand normal national education, while the [Japanese] are pushing forward the work of enslavement by all kinds of blasphemous education. This is the most tragic situation in the world! We can only hope that our Christian educators will display a spirit of great fearlessness and make greater efforts and struggles to, on the one hand, establish contact with all educators engaged in national salvation and reconstruction in the war zone and the rear, and on the other hand, make tenacious and ingenious struggles against the violent orders and threats of all puppet regimes. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended this meeting, stated: The future education policy of Christianity should also "ensure the lives of teachers and students." This determination not to fear the strong and to maintain the dignity and safety of education is most admirable. We further hope that this conference will decide on more concrete and effective methods to preserve the vitality of our country and nation and cultivate true defenders of truth for society and mankind.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two points that we warmly hope for at the National Christian University Education Conference: first, under the current situation of national peril and educational difficulties, we must do more and greater efforts for education and culture: such as adapting to all current needs, referring to the actual situation in various places, leading students, expanding library equipment, promoting mass education, adding wartime lectures, training technical talents for resisting Japan and building the country, striving for various wartime service work, and sincerely promoting the National Spiritual Mobilization, assisting the national salvation movement of young students in various places, etc. The second is to closely link with the Christian education community abroad, publicize the [Japanese] atrocities of Japan's invasion of China and the situation of the youth in China's education sector fighting bloody battles for human justice and peace, and obtain greater sympathy and assistance from the international community in terms of morality and material.</p>
<p>During this period of the War of Resistance, when the country's survival is at stake, we have a greater sense of riding in the same boat in the face of the storms with the university principals and professors attending this meeting! The universities that you preside over, in the war zones, in the occupied areas, and in the distant rear areas, have already achieved hard work in the past, and the situation in the future may not be improved, and the responsibility will be even greater. In addition to gratitude and expectation, we can only pray that you will uphold the great spirit of Christ, not value the current reward, but look forward to the spiritual comfort that will be given to you after the success of the War of Resistance and national construction of the Chinese nation and the realization of world peace! We hereby congratulate you on your health, and we hereby congratulate the National Christian University Education Conference on its success!</p>

<h3>Our Country's Future War of Resistance Occupies an Absolute Advantage; The [Japanese]'s Resources are Exhausted and their Combat Power is Weakening; The Attack on Changsha Will Become a Lasting Reflection; An Important Report by Our Military Commission</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, Central News Agency, 18th) Our army recently abandoned Nanchang. The domestic and foreign countries are paying close attention to the future war situation, especially the attempt of the [Japanese] army to invade Changsha, which is of great concern to all parties. Moreover, if the [Japanese] army once occupied Changsha, it would be able to achieve its goal of controlling the western provinces of China, thereby seeking resources to reduce the burden of its own military vehicles. A reporter from this agency recently visited the spokesperson of the Military Commission to inquire about everything, and was honored to have the following remarks: On the surface, the [Japanese] army has occupied Nanchang, and our Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been cut off, making transportation more difficult. It will naturally have a considerable impact on the future war situation. However, a closer examination of the content shows that our army's resolute abandonment of Nanchang this time will not only have no impact on the future war situation, but will actually be beneficial to us. First,</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs</p>
<p>In this battle in northern Jiangxi, after bloody battles for several weeks, our army has completely completed the task of attrition due to proper use and the willingness of officers and soldiers to die as if going home. The main force of the [Japanese] Central China Expeditionary Army has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, and the deaths of regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and other important officers are numerous. Its combat strength has been greatly weakened, and the main purpose of our army's operation is to use the mountains to lure the [Japanese] army deep, and wait until the majority of the [Japanese] army's main force is attracted to a suitable area, and then the various mechanical weapons of the [Japanese] army will lose their effectiveness. Then, we can give full play to the advantages of our army and give the [Japanese] army a fatal blow, causing them to lose their combat capabilities. It is not about the gains and losses of a city or a place. The [Japanese] army's invasion of northern Jiangxi this time, sacrificing so much, is precisely for this reason. Therefore, it is also a necessary measure for our army to abandon Nanchang and transfer the main force to a favorable position. In the future, the more the [Japanese] army goes, the deeper it will sink. If it takes the risky action of invading Changsha, then the degree of its sacrifice will inevitably be even greater. There is no doubt about it. This is one thing. (See lower half of the page)</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting on the Western Front: Enemy Momentum in Northwestern Shanxi Largely Thwarted; Enemy in Eastern Shanxi Invades Southward in Three Routes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 18th] Shaanxi and Shanxi troops of our army are still attacking Yicheng, Wenxi, and Jiangxian. About 5,000 enemy troops from Pingyao, Taigu, and Yuci in Eastern Shanxi launched a three-pronged southward invasion yesterday, with each contingent consisting of over 1,000 men. Fierce battles are currently underway in Nancang, south of Pingyao; Malingguan, south of Taigu; and Fenshuling, Xing County, with numerous enemy casualties.</p>
<p>[Telegram from the Minkuo News Agency, Xixian, 18th] A certain unit of our forces, disguised as the enemy, launched a night attack and entered the city of Lingshi, killing the puppet county magistrate on the spot.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xingji, 17th] The enemy forces in Northwestern Shanxi have suffered a significant setback in momentum following our day and night counter-attacks. The majority of the enemy troops in Wuzhai have fled to Shenchi, and the remaining remnants will soon be eliminated. In the areas of Lishi, Zhongyang, and Jinluozhen, the stalemate continues, but the enemy's offensive has weakened, engaging only in small-scale harassment, resulting in no major engagements.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 17th] Our attacking forces in Southern Shanxi are currently pressing towards major strongholds in Anyi, Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Yicheng. The enemy is visibly struggling to cope with the situation. The battles in the suburbs of various cities have been exceptionally fierce in recent days.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xingji, 17th] Our forces counter-attacking the east side of the Tongpu Railway in the Yellow River Delta have made smooth progress after days of hard fighting. We have successively captured Yangshe, Podi, Chejiahe, and Guo Niu southeast of Wenxi, leaving behind hundreds of enemy corpses. Furthermore, a certain unit is besieging Zhangdian (southeast of Anyi) and Ershiling (near Jiexian) with fierce attacks for days. The enemy's momentum has waned. Troops attacking Jiexian are currently engaged in fierce fighting near the city, with some units advancing to Yu Xiang Qing Hua Town, cutting off enemy communications. Remnant enemy forces near Xiaxian are being routed by our women's squads. Over 1,000 enemy reinforcements from Anyi and Yuncheng were intercepted by our forces, resulting in hundreds of casualties. On the Yicheng front, we have cut off the enemy's rear route at Henglingguan. The west gate and southern suburbs of Yicheng, including Shicun, have been occupied by us. The enemy is still stubbornly resisting within the city and has sent 2,000 reinforcements from Quwo to operate eastward.</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia Defect En Masse</h3>
<p>[Telegram from the Minkuo News Agency, Hequ, 18th] A certain detachment of a certain army of our forces advancing to the Northwest Frontier, along with the Ethnic Revolutionary Wartime Mobilization Committee of the Second War Zone and the Chahar-Suiyuan Border Region Working Committee, arrived in Suiyuan last year. Behind enemy lines, they mobilized the masses to establish guerrilla bases in the Daqing Mountains, thwarting numerous enemy "mopping-up" operations. Recently, due to our army's proactive actions and widespread propaganda, a wave of defections has been triggered among various puppet army units. On April 1st, the puppet Taolin County Security Team, unable to endure the oppression and bullying of the Japanese, staged a defection late at night, killing dozens of enemy soldiers and wounding several others. The entire unit then marched out of the city, raised the banner of righteousness, and sent a telegram to the nation declaring their opposition to the puppet regime, vowing to fight to the end under the leadership of Chairman Jiang to overthrow Japanese fascism and establish a new, independent, free, and happy democratic republic of China.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 16th] Over 550 men from the puppet 7th Division, led by Division Commander Liu Fuxi, Yang Zhanshan, and Liu Chongtu, defected on the 11th in Taolin County, eastern Suiyuan. Several enemy officers were shot on the spot. We have already dispatched personnel to reorganize them and appointed Zhao Dayi as commander of the guerrilla detachment. Zhao is currently leading his troops to attack the enemy in Fengzhen.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Luoyang, 17th] Yang Fengcai, the commander of the pistol battalion under the puppet Che Liying, possesses patriotic sentiments and hates Li's unlawful actions. He has now led all 500 of his officers and soldiers in a defection, with all their weapons intact. They have arrived near the Wei River and surrendered to a certain unit of our forces for acceptance.</p>
<h3>Our Nation Purchases 2,000 Vehicles from America</h3>
<p>[Report from This Port] A certain Mr. He, a key member of the Fuxing Corporation, was recently ordered by the company to go to Rangoon to receive the transportation vehicles purchased with a large loan recently secured from the United States. It is reported that a total of 2,000 vehicles were purchased with the loan, to be delivered in approximately three or four batches. At the latest, delivery will be completed by November of this year. The first batch of over 140 vehicles has already arrived in Rangoon. Mr. He and others will go to Rangoon to take delivery of this batch of vehicles and hand them over to the Southwest Transportation Company for use. Of these 2,000 vehicles, 1,000 will be fully handed over to the Southwest Transportation Company to meet current needs, while the other 1,000 will be handed over to our country's Trade Adjustment Committee. Their purpose is to transport tung oil and other major export goods from our country.</p>
<h3>English and American Newspapers in Shanghai Receive Threats</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to a Shanghai dispatch, four English-owned newspapers and two American-owned newspapers in Shanghai, which have consistently adopted an opposition stance towards Japan, all received threatening letters today signed by the "China Youth Salvation Society." The letters stated that if the newspapers did not adopt a "fair" attitude, the society would use bombs and pistols against them. The assassination of a Mr. Cao, a distributor for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury last night, was also believed to have been carried out by the same terrorist elements. Currently, authorities in the Public Concession and the French Concession are providing close protection to the newspapers while actively investigating the matter. It is undoubtedly believed that the so-called "China Youth Salvation Society" is a pro-Japanese terrorist organization.</p>
<h3>British Concession in Tianjin Cracks Enemy Agency; Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Distribution Chief Cao Guodong Assassinated</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin reports that an enemy agency established in the Tianjin British Concession has been cracked by British authorities. Five pistols were seized. After Xi Geng was assassinated at the Grand Theater, the British Concession began searching the concession. On the 13th, an individual claiming to be Commander Zhu was arrested in Yongshan Lane, No. 61. He is believed to be an agent of the enemy tasked with disrupting the concession. Three of his accomplices and five pistols were also taken to the Municipal Council for questioning. This incident proves the previous rumors of enemy agents establishing agencies in the concession to plot mischief were not false.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Shanghai, 17th] Cao Guodong, the 43-year-old distribution chief of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, was shot and killed tonight. The assassins escaped in a car. A stray bullet injured a woman. It is rumored that the incident has political motives.</p>
<h3>Petty Traitor Wang Xianmin Assassinated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Wang Xianmin (transliteration), a low-ranking official in the Nanjing "Reformed Government," was assassinated last night in the French Concession of Shanghai. His body was found in the chapel of a certain theater, riddled with knife wounds and bullet holes. A note was attached to his clothing, stating that Wang was a traitor and signed with the words "Traitor Elimination Corps."</p>
<h3>National Government Orders</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The National Government issued the following orders on the 17th:</p>
<p>(1) Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government, has resigned due to illness. Approved. Zhou Yie will succeed him.</p>
<p>(2) Appoint Lin Hongren as a First-Class Army Surgeon.</p>
<h3>Solemn Statement from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Basic Policies of the Communist Party; Close Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; Unite with Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union; Expose the Japanese Conspiracy to Fabricate Documents</h3>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Chongqing, 18th] The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today issued a statement to Reuters, declaring that neither the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party nor its branches have been involved in any of the propaganda pamphlets recently circulating in Shanghai. These propaganda pamphlets criticize the attitudes of Britain and France towards China and advocate for the establishment of an anti-British and anti-French front, otherwise the Communist Party should split with the Kuomintang. The statement denounces this as "absurd and ridiculous," stating that its content is completely inconsistent with the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "establishing a united front to resist Japan." The statement says that the basic policies of the Chinese Communist Party are: "First, to establish cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to expel the Japanese from China and rebuild a new China that is independent, free, and happy. Second, to seek cooperation from countries around the world that sympathize with China, especially Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union." The statement continues, "The content of these propaganda pamphlets is clearly contrary to the views of the Chinese Communist Party and aims to disrupt the friendly relations between Britain and France and China's resistance. We believe that the British and French governments are fully aware of this. At the same time, the scheme to divide the Chinese people internally in order to create animosity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has completely failed."</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech Clarifies the Path to Victory</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] After the weekly memorial service on the 17th, several Chinese and foreign journalists asked Chairman Chiang the following questions. The following is a record of his answers: (Reporter asked) "There are still people who say that Konoe's statement on 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' can be used as a basis for peace between China and Japan, and do not recognize it as a condition for national subjugation. What should be done with this?" (Chairman Chiang replied) "'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' is just a new term for Japan's annexation of China. In my speech on December 26th of last year, I already analyzed in detail Japan's ambition to invade China. There is no need to say more. If we use Konoe's statement and interpret the word 'peace' as acceptable conditions, then the dictionary would no longer need the word 'surrender.' This is an extremely shameless joke. Not only will this not happen today, but it will never happen. The purpose of China's resistance is to defend the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. Our struggle will not stop until this goal is achieved. Now, the longer the war drags on, the more Japan's weaknesses are exposed, and its ambitions become even more apparent. This is the so-called 'the dagger is revealed when the map is unrolled' principle. With the actions of the Japanese militarists, anyone can see that they are trying to seize the lives of our entire nation and make us their slaves forever. Konoe's so-called 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' is Japan's sinister plan to dominate East Asia, not only to eliminate China, but also to eliminate all the power of all countries in the Pacific. Japan's desire for aggression is advancing with the times, and China's understanding of the progress of Japan's ambitions is becoming clearer. Therefore, our will to resist is becoming even stronger. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no room for peace, and we will absolutely not be shaken by any clever, hypocritical surrender theories. This is the determination of our entire country. As for those who advocate this extremely shameless view, I believe that the power of moral and conscientious sanctions, according to our Chinese principles, is greater than the power of legal sanctions. Such people have already declared their own death sentence in spirit, and they are really not worth mentioning. As for the state's punishment, it will depend on their future actions." (Question) "How can the Sino-Japanese War ultimately be resolved?" (Answer) "This question depends on how the facts evolve in the future. We have only been resisting for 22 months, not even two years, and Japan's international status as a first-class country has already been reduced to a second-class country by our resistance. If we continue to intensify our resistance, based on the facts of the past, I believe that in the near future, it will inevitably make it impossible for him to maintain his current status as a second-class country. In this way, on the one hand, his national power will be more exhausted and his status will be lower, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our own strength, reach a favorable time and a favorable position, and give him a fatal blow? Only by making him truly recognize the power of China's resistance can there be hope for peace. I believe that this is not only possible, but as long as we work hard, this period will surely come soon. In addition to this, if we want to restore peace between China and Japan, then unless the Japanese militarists have a thorough awakening and automatically abandon their aggression, their traditional policies must be fundamentally changed. If they do not fundamentally abandon their policy of aggression..." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>China Will Occupy an Absolutely Advantageous Position in the War of Resistance in the Future</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first question on this page) Second,</p>
<p>Politically speaking, since the enemy invaded and occupied Wuhan, it has inadvertently fallen into the trap we set. The enemy's manpower and resources have reached a point that is not permitted by its national policy. Therefore, after the Battle of Wuhan's periphery came to an end, the enemy's military actions fell into a state of inability to advance further. They then issued a so-called defense statement, using the guise of peace to try to shake our country's national policy of resistance. However, the anti-war sentiment among the enemy's front-line soldiers is raging like a wildfire. The internal popular anger and the front-line morale decline have both reached an extreme. Now, the launch of the Battle of Northern Jiangxi is only an attempt to divert the attention of its people. However, with such a high price, the morale of the people and soldiers will be disturbed, and future combat will become increasingly difficult. If they invade Changsha to the west, the price they pay will be even more incalculable. This is the second point. Third,</p>
<p>Economically speaking, the enemy has spent over 10 trillion on this war of aggression against China. The total amount of public debt has reached 16 trillion, most of which is a deficit. It is now estimated that an average of about 140 million is needed every day. Even if the enemy were to scrape everything clean, it would be powerless. The attempt to plunder financial resources in China is very active. However, in the occupied areas, there are our guerrilla armies, cooperating with civilian armed forces, constantly giving them strong blows, making them unable to sleep peacefully. After occupying Nanchang, they turned their forces west to Changsha. Even if our Zhejiang-Jiangxi and even Hunan-Jiangxi communications are completely cut off, the center of gravity of our external transportation is not on the southeast coast. What is imported from the southeast coast is only a part of luxury goods that consume money. If the import route of these luxury goods is interrupted in the future, in addition to saving a lot of financial and national strength invisibly, we can concentrate all our efforts on other transportation routes. The adjustment of the import and export of various important materials is actually beneficial to us. The enemy's attempt to plunder our resources has not yet been realized, and it is even more impossible to control our western provinces. From any point of view, military, political, or economic, the enemy's invasion of Nanchang and even the westward invasion of Changsha only proves its last flash of glory. The period of its total collapse must not be far away. And we are fighting for the independence and survival of the country and the nation, and for human justice and righteousness. Our manpower and financial resources are inexhaustible, and we can become stronger and more courageous as we fight. Obvious victory must belong to us. Therefore the situation between us and the enemy after the abandonment of Nanchang is actually very clear.</p>

<h3>Counter-Attacks on All Fronts Progressing Smoothly; Various Circles in Shanghai Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] A Shanghai dispatch states that various groups in Shanghai, encouraged by the recent frequent reports of victories in our army's counter-attacks on all fronts, have sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The original telegram reads: "To Chairman Chiang and all officers and soldiers on all fronts: Twenty-one months have passed since the July 7th Incident. Although the enemy has launched a fierce attack on us with the troops of the entire country and with sharp weapons, thanks to your wise decisions and command, and the brave and dedicated efforts of all the officers and soldiers, the enemy has suffered a heavy blow. Recently, you launched a counter-attack on all fronts, progressing smoothly and with great momentum, posing a more serious threat to the enemy. The good news has spread, and we are deeply encouraged. We send our sincere regards and hope that you will continue to make efforts to annihilate the ugly enemy, restore our homeland. Although the people in the isolated island have a harsh environment, they are firmly committed to resisting the war and will make their best efforts to strive for the final victory and complete the great cause of national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our sincere blood and respectfully ask for your acceptance. The various groups in Shanghai kowtow."</p>
<h3>Mobilizing the Strength of the Entire Nation: President Chiang's Broadcast Address Exposes the Great Significance of Spiritual Mobilization; Full Implementation Must Begin on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>(Continued from the Third Page of Yesterday's Newspaper) Secondly, we must ask ourselves, since the War of Resistance, has there been positive development and progress in our spirit? Are there still many shortcomings? Speaking of this, I want to remind our compatriots of something I said more than a year ago. This was when the War of Resistance had only been going on for two or three months. At that time, foreign opinions of our country varied, but one particularly shocking comment was: "China is not strong enough, either spiritually or materially, to resist foreign forces." I wonder if our compatriots still remember this sentence. I, personally, keep this sentence in mind every day, using it to warn and encourage myself, never forgetting it for a moment. This sentence is a kind of insult to us, which must be proven wrong by facts in the future. Of course, we have already shown many heroic and courageous deeds during the War of Resistance, but compatriots must remember that the war is not over yet, the Japanese invaders have not been driven out, and final victory has not yet been achieved. We must frankly and earnestly examine ourselves. Has the spirit of our people really progressed along with the progress of the war? Have our past shortcomings been completely washed away during the War of Resistance? Have those of us with responsibilities fulfilled our responsibilities? Have those of us with abilities used our abilities to the fullest? Has everyone's life become consistently serious and tense? Have we in the front and in the rear truly achieved a unified response and shared weal and woe? Are our thoughts, words, and actions completely focused on the goals of "nation above all, people above all, military first, and victory first"? Have we achieved consistency between words and actions in everything we say and do? Can everyone maintain the same generous and enthusiastic spirit of resistance from beginning to end, regardless of danger or safety? Can we be absolutely unwavering, unyielding, honest, and truthful? Furthermore, can our confidence in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction be accepted and understood by every citizen? Can we make the Japanese invaders and the puppet traitors recognize the invincible strength of our national spirit? Has the lifestyle of our society generally met the conditions of wartime life? I know that conscientious compatriots, if they think about themselves and look at the society around them, will definitely feel that we need to be more vigilant, more energetic, and more mutually reflective and encouraging. If a country has material deficiencies and cannot fill them in a short time, it should not be a shame for the country; because material production requires manpower, material resources, and especially the various conditions of time, which cannot be supplemented in a short time. However, spiritual deficiencies are different! With spirit, one part of material can be used as ten parts of material; and it can create a large amount of material; without spirit, as Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "the human body becomes a dead thing," no matter how many weapons and materials you have, they are all useless! Moreover, spirit is different from material. Spirit is inherent in every citizen. It is not external and can be improved and enhanced by inspiration and in the transfer of a single thought. If a country suffers foreign aggression due to spiritual decline, it is already an unparalleled shame for this generation of citizens. If, at a time of crisis and survival, we still cannot concentrate our spirit, inform every household, and encourage each other to defend our nation and overcome the current difficulties, and create a future destiny, then it is not only a shame for this generation of citizens, but simply a crime! Because this is "not that we cannot do it, but that we do not do it," and there is no reason to forgive ourselves! You must know that if we win the War of Resistance and succeed in national reconstruction, the fate of the Chinese nation for thousands of years will not be interrupted; we will also be confident that we can build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. On the other hand, if the country loses its independence and survival because our generation lacks a vigorous and unyielding spirit, then future historians will not know how severely they will criticize this period of history! Our general citizens will certainly be blamed for generations, and leaders and intellectuals from all walks of life with higher knowledge, ability, and status will be even less able to escape the blame of historians! Now the War of Resistance has entered the second stage. This is our last chance for victory, and it is also our last chance for the people to serve the country and redeem themselves. That is why, in the midst of extremely busy military and political affairs, I am advocating a general mobilization of the national spirit, which is to give our compatriots, especially leaders from all walks of life, a final opportunity to serve the country. The items included in the general mobilization of the spirit have already been listed in the outline, and there are also items that are not listed in the outline, which everyone can infer by analogy. In order to promote this mobilization universally, the method of holding national monthly meetings and swearing national covenants is first established. When everyone holds these meetings, they must not do it perfunctorily. You must know that these simple eleven articles are our weapons for resisting the Japanese invaders. We must carry them out with a spirit of not fearing death, not fearing hardship, and not fearing difficulty. For example, we say that we will not work for the Japanese invaders and traitors. If we encounter any forced coercion, we will only fight to the death and refuse to swear. For example, we say that we will not violate the Three Principles of the People and will not violate the interests of the nation and the people. If there is any external coercion or temptation to violate the Three Principles of the People and do something that violates the interests of the nation and the people, we should also grit our teeth and rather die than break our oath. We will endure any pain and refuse to break our oath. Our current situation shows that we have already entered the glorious line of turning over, and every citizen must regard himself as standing on the line of certain death, just as the ancients said, "Keep death in mind at all times, and seek life in every action." Every move we make, every drop of sweat, and every drop of blood must be used to seek the glorious and independent survival of the country and the nation. But what do we rely on to fight? It is our personal determination to die. If everyone has a determination to die at any time, the Japanese invaders will undoubtedly collapse in front of us, and the noble spirit of the Chinese nation can be universally developed to achieve the certain victory of the War of Resistance and the certain success of national reconstruction! Regarding the essence of the general mobilization of the spirit, what I want to say is really endless for a while. The oath mentioned above is the essence of the matter. I earnestly request every one of our compatriots to abide by the common goals of "nation above all, people above all, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," earnestly restore our nation's inherent morality, strengthen our spiritual fortress, and dedicate our thoughts to the country. To be filial to the nation, to be benevolent to suffering compatriots, to be trustworthy in all people and things, and to exert all our strength. In this chaotic and dim world, we seek true and lasting peace. I urge our compatriots to understand that the War of Resistance is a great responsibility for national reconstruction, and we must complete it together. Therefore, we must deeply regret the mistakes of the past in not truly believing in the Three Principles of the People. From now on, we must establish our belief in national reconstruction based on the Three Principles of the People, and fulfill our promises and seek its realization. The most basic point is that our compatriots, from the old to the young, must have a passionate confidence in the bright future of the nation. We must confirm that the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People, which will be established after the victory of the War of Resistance, will be a new country that surpasses others, a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, and the most thorough and progressive country that can contribute to the welfare of the world. Now is a critical period of the War of Resistance, and we cannot afford to engage in any empty talk or fantasies, nor can we waste a moment of time or energy. We should face the current powerful enemy, face the country's difficulties and seriousness, reflect on our responsibilities, and earnestly examine all our shortcomings and weaknesses; on the one hand, we should quickly and effectively transform ourselves, set an example, and constantly remind our compatriots throughout the country, help our compatriots who have not yet woken up, and awaken our general compatriots with lower levels of knowledge. Let us rise up together, correct our decadent and self-destructive lives, develop a vigorous and progressive spirit, eliminate the habits of surviving by chance and being insincere, break the attempts of selfishness and surrender, correct the divergent and misleading thoughts that harm the country and ourselves, tighten our emotions, and unify our actions, so that the spirit of our Chinese nation can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve a general mobilization of the national spirit, and develop a spirit of great strength and integrity to complete our mission of connecting the past and opening up the future. My dear compatriots, I hope everyone will fight for the country and cherish themselves for the country. Goodbye!</p>

<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] Tokyo dispatch: Army Minister Itagaki today issued a statement saying that regarding the issue of opening the Yangtze River, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have previously sent notes to Japan, but the government has not yet decided whether Japan should respond.

<h3>The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union Are About to Conclude an Agreement; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Are Nearing Completion; Poland Is Discussing the Defense of Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] French authorities have recently announced that the United Kingdom and France have reached an agreement with the Soviet Union that, in the event of new aggression in Europe, Soviet air force assistance will be invoked.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] A certain political commentator recently published an article in "Radical Newspaper," saying that it is expected that after April 18, Paris and London can announce guarantees to Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey, including Turkey. In addition, an agreement will be concluded with the Soviet Union to complete this guarantee system. The agreement can be formally announced within this week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] The British House of Commons will reopen at 2:45 PM today after the Easter recess. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will talk about the latest news. It is expected that the audience will be disappointed because the Prime Minister does not have specific reports. Also, the Prime Minister does not intend to publish any formal reports, but will answer questions from all parties during the question time, and announce that the United Kingdom accepts President Roosevelt's suggestion that the Anglo-Soviet and Anglo-Turkish negotiations are in progress, and the latter is nearing completion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The Soviet Ambassador here has recently been recalled to his country. This morning he left by plane to report to his government on the negotiations with the British government. British Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Halifax today, and Army Minister Hore-Belisha also visited the Prime Minister. Also, the Turkish Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The Soviet Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office today, but did not meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax, and only held general consultations with ordinary staff. Officials here said that the news that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have established air force and arms supply agreements is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] It is announced here that the Soviet Ambassador will return to his country on Tuesday to participate in the talks between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow. Officials said that this talk has now progressed to an important stage, so the Soviet Ambassador can rush back to Moscow to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Well-informed sources say that Romania has agreed to accept Soviet assistance when necessary. The Soviet Union will not only sign an air force agreement with Romania, but can also send troops through Romanian territory.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] When the authorities discussed the progress of the Eastern European defense system negotiations in Poland and Romania, they said, "The situation is very good," but the negotiations have not yet ended, so it is considered premature to make declarations about such circumstances.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The cabinet meeting or state council is now scheduled to be held on April 18 to discuss the international situation, which will be chaired by President Lebrun.</p>
<h3>Germany Is Negotiating a Response to the United States; Rumors Say It Will Make Counter-Demands; Göring Returns Home with the Italian Reply for Discussion; Hull Discusses the Magnificent Effects of Roosevelt's Contribution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The impression in political circles here is that Hitler will make counter-demands to Roosevelt in his reply to the US President's speech in the German parliament on April 28. Observers here do not expect Hitler to make a completely negative reply. What counter-demands Hitler is about to make is still difficult to predict, but according to opinions here, the content is nothing more than wanting countries to provide peace guarantees, and must first consider agreeing to what Germany considers legitimate demands. So-called legitimate demands include the settlement of colonies and Germany's economic actions in the Balkans, gaining freedom and being free from accusations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th] When this question is asked of the German and Italian telegrams replying to President Roosevelt, they will make a positive refusal to his main suggestions. The main suggestion is that no country will be invaded within ten years, and that an international conference will be held. The Italian reply will strongly state that what Italy values is nothing more than peace, but the two actions in Abyssinia and Albania are due to the national conditions of those two countries, which actually endanger world peace, so this is done. Regarding the point of convening an international conference, Italy will make its participation conditional on satisfying its demands on France, and it is deeply believed here that the President's telegram will be regarded as a useless letter and will not be the basis for making counter-demands.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th] Göring set off today to return to Berlin. Before that, he discussed President Roosevelt's peace proposals with Mussolini. Italy's reply is expected to be published at the same time as Germany's reply.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] General Göring left here today and returned to Berlin quickly. It is said that he has a simple reply from Mussolini to President Roosevelt's appeal telegram. The Axis countries have expressed their hatred of those who claim that they are causing difficulties, and any suggestions based on such remarks will be rejected. It is generally expected that the German reply will be decided after Göring returns to his country and consults with Hitler and Ribbentrop.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that since President Roosevelt issued a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini, the world's concept of peace has increased with it. Hull continued, the government is very grateful for the enthusiastic response of European and Western Hemisphere countries to the President's telegram, and the general public has felt that the President's move is a practical peace contribution that adapts to the times, and at the same time, the greatest power to maintain peace, that is, the public's concept, has shown strong development everywhere in the world. As for how Berlin and Rome will answer the President's call, no news has been received so far.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Regarding President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, the State Council has received many replies from various countries. All Latin American countries except Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, and Paraguay have expressed their approval. The Canadian government also sent a telegram, expressing admiration. The telegram from the President of Brazil said that Your Excellency's move is worthy of being the leader of the American continent, and the remarks you made have resonated in our country. The President of Cuba said in a telegram that our government read the telegram yesterday and was deeply impressed. Your Excellency is worthy of being a famous politician. On behalf of the people of the whole country, I publicly express the solidarity between the two countries.</p>

<h3>French Warships Gather in the Port of Gibraltar; British Warships Are Stationed in Malta; Actions Against Authoritarian Countries</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 17th] Eighteen warships have concentrated here, coinciding with reports that authoritarian countries will take action against Tangier. The British fleet is also stationed in Malta. It is believed that this action by the British and French fleets is related to the German navy's exercises on the Spanish coast and the rumor that the Spanish Moroccan army has increased from 40,000 to 90,000.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 18th] Gibraltar is now concentrated with many French warships. In recent years, the number of French warships sailing to this port has never been so large as this time. Three destroyers arrived here yesterday. The current total number is twelve, and several more are expected to arrive there last night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 17th] Two French battleships and two destroyers arrived in this port yesterday. Today, three cruisers, namely the Marseille, La Galissonnière, and Jean de Vienne, and six destroyers, namely the Valda, Mogador, Bold, Hurricane, Happiness, and Simon, successively arrived under the command of French Navy Generals Marquis and Lacroix, respectively. In total, there are 13 ships. At the same time, the Spanish destroyer Sodorro also arrived at the Spanish port of Algeciras, close to the port of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 17th] According to reliable information, French warships will continue to arrive here today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 17th] There are currently 13 French warships stationed in Gibraltar, and the entire British Mediterranean Fleet is currently stationed in and near Malta. There are also several British ships stationed in Gibraltar, mostly destroyers, which have been stationed there.</p>

<h3>Australian Naval and Air Forces Hold Large-Scale Exercises</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, Australia, 18th] The Australian fleet began exercises here yesterday and will be completed on the 19th. The scale of this exercise is the largest since the European War. The New Zealand flagship Leander and eight air force teams are also conducting joint exercises with the Australian Navy. The plan of the exercise closely imitates the situation of war, and passing merchant ships are prevented from stopping and inquiring.</p>
<h3>Woodring Delivers a Speech; The United States Must Expand Its Military; The Senate Passes Additional Army Funding; Pacific Naval Facilities Will Be Improved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The Senate today passed an additional funding bill of $152,000,000, of which $11,000,000 was allocated for army equipment, such as the purchase of semi-automatic rifles, tanks, tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, gas masks, artillery, and bullets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Army Minister Woodring said in a speech here tonight that the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are currently shrouded in war clouds, and people all over the world are caught in the terror of war. The United States' finances and economy are also adversely affected. Therefore, it is necessary for the United States to expand its military. Due to the invention of modern new weapons, Americans should feel that although the United States has the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as protection, it is no longer safe. From a military point of view, the United States can no longer be a single continent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The US Navy Department's order to move the fleet to the Pacific has repeatedly caused speculation, or it is believed that the United States will take concrete steps to improve the naval facilities in the Pacific to facilitate the defense of the west coast of South America. Naval strategists have long believed that the United States needs more bases south of San Diego to provide adequate defense for the Panama Canal and to defend against possible attacks on the west coast of South America. Private opinions believe that the US government may consider purchasing the Galapagos Islands in the South Pacific to build air force and submarine bases, but naval officials have no comment.</p>
<p>Pittman Will Request Restrictions on Trade with Japan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced today that although the European situation is still tense, the Neutrality Act's "cash and carry" provision will expire on the 30th of this month. According to Pittman, the "cash and carry" provision may continue to be extended and effective, but it must be revised. Also, according to authoritative sources, Pittman will ask Congress to restrict US trade with Japan because Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Chairman of the US Senate Naval Committee, Mr. Walsh, recently requested to expand the US Navy and Air Force to protect the country and prevent incidents. We can no longer protect a country with two oceans with a navy of one ocean. He also advocated amending the Neutrality Act to prohibit all trade with belligerent countries after the outbreak of war.

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrives in Berlin tomorrow, he will explain to Ribbentrop the actual situation of Britain's guarantee to Romania.

<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang has actively launched counter-offensives on all fronts, and progress is smooth and the momentum is great. For example, advancing into Xinyang in Henan, breaking into Kaifeng, occupying Shijiazhuang, coordinating the attack on Xuzhou, and besieging Guangzhou, etc., have severely threatened the newly launched offensive by the × army, presenting an unprecedented atmosphere of victory in various war zones. However, the victory on the front lines depends on the full support and promotion of our entire rear area and overseas Chinese compatriots. Therefore, Chairman Chiang solemnly swore the National Covenant on the morning of the 17th, setting an example, and broadcasted a speech in the afternoon, showing the great and sacred significance of implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization, encouraging all Chinese sons and daughters to rise up in time and sincerely implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline in order to concentrate the power of the entire nation, support the war of resistance, strive for victory, and lay the foundation for building a country of, by, and for the people in the future.</p>

We must unanimously and enthusiastically support Chairman Chiang's call. Our overseas Chinese compatriots should especially inherit the glorious tradition of overseas Chinese saving the country in the past.

<h3>The Mysterious Politician of South Africa</h3>
<p>— A Translation</p>
<p>This South African Minister of Defence, Piro Aus Watt, caused much speculation about the future of the former German colonies in Africa because of his trip through European capitals last November. What kind of person is he? It hasn't been many months since Mr. Piro shook the world with a word. His words were:</p>
<p>"The ruling class of Great Britain agrees with the proposition that 'unless a way is found to compensate Germany for its lost colonies, relations with Germany can never be built on a foundation of peaceful coexistence.' And this compensation can only be sought in Africa. To maintain the dominance of white people on the African continent, nothing is more important than cooperation between Africa and Germany. I can say that the authorities agree with me on this point."</p>
<p>This declaration was clearly the peak of Mr. Piro's struggle. Then he had another most frightening declaration:</p>
<p>"I am very happy to see Germany return to Africa in the future, because only the Nazis know how to treat the natives."</p>
<p>Piro Aus Watt began his political career as one of the leaders of the Transvaal Republican Party. In 1929, he was the youngest cabinet member in General Hertzog's government. Later, he was appointed Minister of Railways and Harbours. During his tenure, he fully demonstrated his organizational skills. At this time, the financial situation of the state-owned railways and harbors was very bad. Piro reorganized the internal organization and transformed almost every year's deficit into a surplus.</p>
<p>He hoped to be promoted and got his wish. He jumped to become Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>An outstanding speaker and political schemer, he is now one of the prominent figures in South Africa. They know the value of contacting the masses. He drives his own plane and his own car. Once, when the natives demonstrated in Durban, he flew there, took the position of police chief, led the attacking team, and dispersed the assembled natives with tear gas. When the crowd was tired of hearing about the lions he had killed and other suppression stories, his interest shifted to international politics. In order to justify his words, Piro declared that all countries that own African colonies should transfer part of them to Germany. This is the fairest thing, and that is all he meant. It is generally speculated that he was specifically referring to Angola and Cameroon.</p>
<p>Now, Piro has kept his pro-German attitude relatively hidden and focused most of his energy on improving South Africa's defense. When we consider his friendly attitude towards Williams Stiles together, we can't help but ask: "What does Piro want?" A well-known former South African minister once answered this question: "The answer is not complicated. Our Minister of Defense has great ambitions. His greatest desire is to be Prime Minister. So he is riding two horses at the same time, running in two directions. He emphasizes Germany's colonial demands and spreads the theories of the black peril. But in order to win British votes and show his loyalty to England, he also advocates the establishment of a national defense organization and the creation of a South African wartime industry."</p>
<p>But no matter what Piro's ambitions are, he has indeed made great contributions to the defense of the South African Federation. The improvement of the Yskor factories, which are sufficient to become the basis of a large metallurgical industry, is so large that many South Africans believe that the region's metallurgical plants will soon become the center of British military industry.</p>

<h3>More Than a Dozen Fishing Boats Burned and Destroyed off the Coast of Chekwan; More Than a Hundred Fishermen Burned to Death; First Machine-Gunned and Then Incendiary Bombs Were Thrown; Only One of More Than a Hundred Fishermen Escaped; Losses Exceeded 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the coastal fishing boats and houses off the coast of Chekwan, Tan Kwong Shan, Wan Shan Mei, Tai O Island, Chalan Lighthouse, Kylin Pain Terrace, Miu Wan, Pak Lik Island, Man Chau Mei, A Chau Hoi, Sam Mun Kwan, 급락, Tung Kwu Tan, Kit Sek Wan, Ling Hang, and Gwo Chau have been devastated by × warships. The deaths of people, the burning and looting of fishing boats, and the loss of property are countless. Unexpectedly, on the 14th of this month, more than a dozen fishing boats off the coast of Chekwan were bombarded by random guns from × warships, and more than 100 fishermen were brutally killed by × bombs. The loss of property amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. Only one fisherman escaped and arrived in Hong Kong. According to him,</p>
<p>Chekwan Coast Suddenly Suffers Misfortune</p>
<p>Since the × warships wreaked havoc on the coast at will, the fishing boats have been reluctant to go far. They only made a living in the sea. However, it was not a long-term solution to sit and eat the mountains. So they were forced to go out to sea again to fish. What they got every day was only enough to support themselves. Recently, in the past month or two, they have caught a lot of fish. The industry is more or less the trend. On the 13th of this month, they went out to sea to fish in groups from Po On County. Before they could start, a destroyer suddenly came tailing them. They dispersed and fled, and the × warship did not chase them. At 6 p.m., they gathered in Chekwan to fish. The harvest was quite abundant on that day. That night, all the boats were anchored in the waters of Da Chekwan. Unexpectedly, around midnight, they suddenly heard the sound of huge ships churning the waves. They knew it was not a good sign and hurriedly wanted to hoist their sails and escape. However, in a hurry, they had no way to implement it, so they waited quietly to see what would happen. Soon they saw a × steamship speeding from the Pacific Ocean, the surface of the river at the southern tip of Po On County, and × used a searchlight to scan the coast, and their fishing boats were seen.</p>
<p>Fishing Boats Were Hit and Burned</p>
<p>Seeing more than a dozen fishing boats gathered in the waters of Chekwan, × warships then fired machine guns at the fishing boats, dozens of rounds at a time, as dense as a string of beads, and then threw incendiary bombs. It was in the middle of the night, and it could be heard far and wide. Wherever it went, it was hit and caught fire. More than a dozen fishing boats were unable to escape and were hit and caught fire. His boat was also hit by several bullets. For a time, the fire was blazing, and the sea was red. The sad voices of calling for help were unbearable to hear and see. Dozens of fishing boats were destroyed by × bombs, and more than 100 fishermen were brutally buried in the fire pit, creating an unprecedented tragedy. His boat was also on fire soon after, so he escaped into the water. At that time, the sea was stormy, and the water flow was rapid. He was exhausted and exhausted less than a minute after falling into the water, so he let the sea drift. Just in the midst of the crisis, a cargo boat happened to pass by, saw the situation, rescued him and brought him to Hong Kong. More than 100 people were killed in this disaster, more than a dozen fishing boats were burned, and the loss of property was nearly 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Air Defense; Another Blackout Drill Will Be Held; Simulating a Sudden Air Raid Alert; No Prior Notice Will Be Given; Upon Hearing the Alert, Lights Must Be Immediately Turned Off; All Air Defense Organizations Will Be Simultaneously Tested With Extreme Rigor</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to actively strengthen passive air defense, are sparing no effort to prepare the necessary facilities for air defense. They have purchased many of the latest alarm instruments and installed them in various selected locations. After the test release on Friday afternoon of last week, the air defense authorities stated that the results of the test release were quite satisfactory, but one location did not seem to need to install this alarm and it is planned to move it to another location. Now it is felt that there are still many missing alarms and seven more alarm instruments have been purchased from England in order to install them in suitable locations. These alarms will be shipped soon.</p>
<p>Blackout Will Not Be Notified in Advance</p>
<p>The former air defense authorities are also planning to conduct a simulated alarm release based on an actual attack. If the Hong Kong authorities approve, they will issue an air raid alert and hold a blackout drill without prior notice when necessary. At that time, all Hong Kong residents, if they hear the alarm, must immediately carry out appropriate control of their lights, so that Hong Kong will be in a black state within a few minutes, and all street lights will also be turned off until the alarm is lifted before normal can be restored. In this exercise, all air defense organizations will be tested extremely rigorously, such as the police force, ambulance team, traffic team, fire brigade, air defense monitors, and disinfection team, etc., will be fully mobilized, and their work efficiency will be specifically demonstrated at that time.</p>
<p>Urge All Businesses to Send Staff for Training</p>
<p>In addition, Hong Kong Air Defense Commissioner Starkie imparted air defense knowledge to residents to obtain more cadres during wartime, he specially set up various training classes, and on the 4th of this month, he divided up the major businesses in Hong Kong, inviting one or two employees to participate. Many days have passed since this letter was issued. Many have responded to the invitation to send employees, but there are still not a few who have not replied. Commissioner Starkie felt that the implementation of this measure should not be delayed any longer, so he sent letters yesterday to businesses that had not replied, urging them to reply quickly. The Air Defense Bureau will hold an examination for air defense monitors and trainers at the Jockey Club Public Restaurant on the 26th to the 28th of this month, from 5:45 pm to 7 pm for three consecutive days. Anyone who wants to participate in the examination must report to the Air Defense Bureau before the next Friday. The Hong Kong Air Defense Federation has recently started its office, which is located on the second floor of the Exchange Building in Ice House Street, telephone number 20990. Office hours are from 9:45 am to 12:30 pm. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong who want to inquire about air defense matters can send a letter or visit the association in person and will be given a detailed answer.</p>

<h3>Wang角 Canton Road: A Large Brawl Occurred Yesterday; Dozens Engaged in Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat, the Cause Being a Dispute over a Woman; Fists Flew and Sticks Came Crashing Down, Many Heads Were Split Open</h3>
<p>Last night at six o'clock, on the vacant lot at the end of Canton Road in Mong Kok, dozens of men suddenly appeared, radiating murderous intent. They lined up facing each other, glaring angrily, rubbing their fists and palms, waiting for the moment to strike. Two or three people from each side were in the middle, negotiating and discussing, but in less than ten minutes, somehow, the two sides clashed, fists and feet flying, short sticks waving wildly. The shouts of battle created an uproar. Dozens of people scattered and charged, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Within just over ten minutes, six or seven people had already been injured, all with heads split open,</p>
<p>Fresh Blood Gushing Out,</p>
<p>splattering all over their bodies, turning them into blood-soaked figures. Two of them fell to the ground, unable to get up, while the two sides continued to fight fiercely. Nearby residents, witnessing the scene, feared that it would escalate into a fatal tragedy and sounded the alarm. Instantly, the sound of police whistles and the shouts of the crowd resonated far and wide. Three Indian policemen and two Chinese policemen who were nearby heard the news and rushed to the scene, panting. Seeing dozens of reckless men engaged in violent brawling, they immediately stepped forward to suppress them and quickly arrested two of them who were wielding short sticks, stopping them from causing further harm. When the thugs saw the police arrive, they scattered like frightened birds and beasts, fleeing in all directions towards Tai Kok Tsui and Sham Shui Po. The two injured men who had fallen to the ground, fearing arrest, struggled to their feet and, taking advantage of the police's inattention, were helped by their companions to quickly run up the nearby stairs to hide. Because of the bloodstains that were smeared all over the ground, the police, unable to find any trace of the fleeing men, took the two arrested men and the five short sticks they had collected back to the police station for detention and investigation. One man gave his name as Li, and the other as Chen. Li was a worker at a timber shop on Canton Road, and Chen was an unemployed rogue. They both firmly denied having organized a brawl or disturbing public order. However, the police detectives, seeing the bloodstains on the ground and not knowing the extent of the injuries of the wounded, detained them for further investigation while sending detectives to investigate. According to informants, the dozens of rioters involved in the brawl were members of the Wo and Tung gangs, and the reason for their fight was a dispute over a prostitute, jealousy and a quarrel over a woman. It is said that many people on both sides were seriously injured and sought treatment from a famous bone-setter afterward. The two sides are still continuing negotiations, and if a resolution cannot be reached, there will likely be a second organized brawl.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, an Explosion at the Swiss Tin Soldering Company in Mong Kok Injured Five People; An Innocent Elementary School Student Passing By Was Also Affected; Fortunately, the Injuries of All Are Not Serious, and They Have Been Sent to the Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>At 4:28 AM yesterday, a tragic steam drum explosion occurred at No. 28 Shandong Street, Mong Kok, injuring nine people on the spot.

When the explosion occurred, the sound was thunderous, and the nearby buildings were shaken. The four partners of the shop, caught off guard, were unable to escape and were injured in the explosion. At that time, the neighboring residents sounded the alarm and immediately telephoned the police station to report the incident. The duty officer, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. At the same time, he requested the fire department to dispatch two fire engines. When the fire engines arrived, they saw smoke everywhere. The firefighters put on gas masks and then went inside to find a way to dissipate the steam from the steam drum. Fortunately, the exploded steam drum was not very large, otherwise, the nearby buildings would have collapsed. Afterward, the firefighters heard moaning sounds and tried to investigate. They found several people injured, lying near the steam drum. Two of them were pinned down by the steam drum and could not move. The firefighters then tried to move the steam drum and helped everyone up. On one hand, the paramedics provided first aid, and on the other hand, they telegraphed the Red Cross to the scene and sent the four injured partners of the shop to the hospital for treatment. However, when the steam drum exploded, a student from Deming School, Cai Xueyuan (12 years old), happened to be passing by the shop door and was injured in the head and face. He was also sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. It was found that the injuries of all were not serious, and there was no danger to their lives.</p>

Fortunately, a small number of sampans and boats still shuttled between Macau and Hong Kong at that time, which did not cause the supply to be completely cut off, but this was not enough to maintain it for a long time, and the traffic of goods and passengers was also inconvenient. Recently, after our army bravely resisted the war and recovered Shaping and Gulou and other places, the Macau-Sanbu ferry, seeing that the waterway was accessible, changed course and tried to sail to Hong Kong, Macau, and Sanbu, hoping to restore normal traffic. Yesterday, it was found that the ferries had completed their trial voyages a few days ago and officially announced the resumption of service yesterday. When people from Siyi in this area heard this news, many returned to their hometown to inspect, and women and children in the war zone in Siyi also took the ferry directly to Macau and then to Hong Kong. In recent days, ferries to Hong Kong and Macau have become more crowded, and the supply of freshwater fish and vegetables has especially increased, with more being transported to Hong Kong for supply. According to a person in the fruit business, Sanbu has now resumed operation, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of vegetables in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>After Our Army Recovered Zengcheng, The Northeast and Northwest Routes Attacked Taipingchang; Our Army in Zengcheng Attacked Southward, Attacking Shitan and Reaching Luogang; Ye Zhao Inspected the Frontline of Zengcong and Met with the Eastern Front Commanders</h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Express] After three days and nights of bloody battles, the Eastern Route of our army formally recovered Zengcheng on the 15th and suppressed the remnants of the enemy. The details of the process have been recorded in detail in the previous report. It has been determined that our current army, in addition to organizing post-war affairs in Zengcheng and appeasing refugees, is also using mobile warfare tactics to attack Taipingchang in a pincer movement to control the throat of Guangzhou, and attacking Shitan to the south to control the Jiulong Railway and cut off the Nuanzhou rear of the Shilong enemy forces. The two main forces are advancing separately and directly, and have successively arrived at Taipingchang and Shangluogang and other places near Shitan, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy. The battle situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>According to military sources, after our army entered Zengcheng, it quickly pursued the remnants of the enemy fleeing from Zengtan and Zengguang Highways in a swift manner, not allowing them to catch their breath. When the enemy on the Zengtan Highway was defeated by our army, the enemy on the Zengguang Road stubbornly resisted in Zhucun. However, after a night of hard fighting, they were finally unable to withstand the defeat and fled on the evening of the 16th. It was found that at that time, in addition to sending the above two routes to pursue the remnants of the enemy, our army also ordered the main force under Huang Tao and Wen Shuhai, which was moving eastward from the Zengcong Line, to return to the north and counterattack the southeast of Taipingchang across Fuhe. Our army that recovered Huaxian also moved east from Shijiao, approaching the northwest of Taipingchang. On the 15th, an arc-shaped encirclement was formed, and the counterattack began on the 16th. Our army attacked from above and below, and the enemy in Taipingchang was attacked from the left and right. However, this place was where the main force of the enemy was located, and it was also an important stronghold on the periphery of Guangzhou. Therefore, the enemy resisted stubbornly, making repeated efforts, and advancing fearlessly. By the 17th, they had forced their way close to the four townships of Taiping, where the stubborn enemy was already wavering, and it would not be difficult to defeat them.</p>
<p>Our Army in Zengcheng Advances into Shitan</p>
<p>After the troops under Wei, Liu, and Chen of the 9th Army Group defeated the enemy fleeing from the Zengtan Highway, they regained their spirits and continued to advance. On the 17th, they went to eliminate the remnants of the enemy fleeing to Zagang and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy, with considerable gains. On the evening of the 16th, a guerrilla team under Shan Peirong, together with a daredevil team of more than 200 regular soldiers, once rushed into Shitan and attacked the enemy's headquarters for about an hour, achieving their goal and safely withdrawing to the rear. They still secretly control the four suburbs to cooperate with the advance of our army. The result of the night raid was also a great success, capturing several machine guns and an enemy flag. At present, the main force of our front-line troops is concentrated on the Zengtan Highway, advancing steadily and calmly. Now that Shitan has been controlled by our army, it will not be difficult for us to capture it in one fell swoop unless the enemy greatly reinforces it.</p>
<p>Ye Zhao Inspects the Frontline of Zengcong</p>
<p>The troops that counterattacked Zengcheng this time were jointly attacked by the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups. Ye Zhao, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Army Group, now believed that our army's counterattack against Zengcheng had achieved its purpose, and the encirclement of Guangzhou had also been completed. In order to promote the advance into Guangzhou and instruct the combat plan, he specially inspected the frontline of Zengcheng and Conghua on the 16th and met with Zhang Deneng and Chen Rongji, the frontline division commanders of the Ninth Army Group. The next morning (the 16th), he continued to visit Donglu, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, Wu Qiyuan, in a certain place, and discussed the future conquest opportunities. He can return to the front line to supervise the battle in three or two days.</p>
<p>The North Bank of Dongjiang Is Largely Cleared</p>
<p>Luo Fengxiang, the Commander of the Guerrilla of the Third District Column, believed that as the Eastern Route counter-offensive progressed and the guerrilla team was responsible for assisting the regular army in storming the enemy and maintaining local security, the future task would be even more important. In order to closely contact the Fourth Guerrilla Area to increase combat effectiveness, he specially dispatched Chief of Staff Xie Jingbai to be responsible for contacting everything. Xie was ordered to arrive at the front line of Dongguan on the 16th and visited Wang Ruozhou, the Commander of the Guerrilla of the Fourth District Column, and Chi Zhongkuan, the Commander of the Southeastern Coast, to discuss everything. It was also found that since our army recovered Zengcheng and the remnants of the enemy fled to Shitan, there were no more enemy traces in the north bank of the Dongjiang River, except for Shilong. Masi, Longjiao, Jutou, Shangxianan, and other areas are all within our army's sphere of influence, and people in various places have also mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance, assisting in clearing out traitors and rectifying local areas, which is extremely exciting and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Counterattack Liantang, Recover Guifeng</p>
<p>On the morning of the same day, the enemy used more than 100 infantry and cavalry, accompanied by several artillery pieces, and attacked the positions of our army in Fen Shui Jiang. Machine guns and steel cannons were as dense as firecrackers. The security team of Gu Dinhua's Fifth District Guerrilla Team stationed there rose up to meet the enemy and launched fierce battles in Damei, Xiaomei Village, Dabaishan, Tianzidi, and Liantang. They then moved slightly to the rear and firmly defended Daze. Zhou Hanling, the Deputy Commander, led the seventh regiment of the security team, Yang Ganji, and launched a counterattack at the dawn of the day. After about three hours of dust warfare, the enemy had suffered more than half of their casualties and gradually became unsustainable. Our team took advantage of the momentum to defeat the enemy and pursued them to Guifeng Mountain. The entire enemy was resolved, and the enemy's corpses were scattered all over the field. We captured nine sun flags, more than fifty rifles, and destroyed two artillery pieces. It was found that Guifeng Mountain was the vanguard of Daze Niowan, which has now been recovered by our army, making both places more stable. The enemy's plot to spy on Danshuikou is even more difficult to achieve. It was also found that since our army recovered Shaping, the market situation has gradually recovered. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Jiaoshan County, has sent many officials to assist in handling local post-war affairs, relieving refugees, and appeasing refugees. The market has been partially restored since the 15th.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Xinhui: Our Army Has a Significant Advantage; The Enemy Attacking Du Ruan Suffered Heavy Losses; We Recovered Guifeng Mountain With a Bamboo-Breaking Momentum</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express] Regarding the Battle of Xinhui, our army has taken a steady and solid step for the past ten days due to the adjustment of time and position, and the enemy has been repeatedly strongly resisted, and its morale has also been reduced. Although it still continues to attack our army's positions, this is only an act of harassing, containing, and probing the strength of our army. The military situation in Jiangmen Huicheng is as follows:</p>
<p>Our Army in Du Ruan Induces the Enemy to Gather and Annihilate</p>
<p>It was reported here yesterday that at about 9:00 AM on the 15th, about 200 members of the enemy's naval landing force, 17 tanks, and 60 or 70 cavalry gathered and attacked the positions of our army in Douruan Jinggen Pingling in the Third District, with a fierce momentum. First, they fired violently with steel cannons, followed by armored vehicles in the lead, with cavalry attached, covering the advance of the infantry. Our army induced the enemy to go deep, leaving only a small force to defend Du Ruan, acting in a circuitous manner, fighting and retreating. The enemy mistakenly believed that our army was fearful and ignored everything, rushing forward. Our army induced the enemy to the mountains at the junction of Du Ruan City, Songtai Ridge, Jinggen Shuanglou and Shimao Mountain, and immediately returned the banner and beat the drum, and the four armies came out. The enemy soldiers suffered a counterattack, were panicked and at a loss, and the formation was chaotic, unable to advance or retreat. They were forced to entangle with us, and the short-range melee was achieved. By the morning of the 16th, the enemy was defeated. In this battle, 36 enemies were killed, countless were wounded, one tank was destroyed, more than ten war horses were wounded and killed, and a great victory was achieved.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Gathers in Haikou to Discuss the Management of Qiongzhou; Starts with Military Control; Dumps Enemy Goods to Revitalize the Market</h3>
<p>[Nanlu Express] According to military reports, since the enemy's invasion of Qiongzhou Island, our guerrillas have been exceptionally active, attacking from time to time, making it impossible to manage Qiongzhou. The enemy general Kondo Nobutake specially summoned senior generals in Haikou again in the early part of this month to discuss how to deal with our guerrillas and the Qiongya plan. It is said that it has been decided that: (1) Dispatch telegrams to the Tokyo Taiwan Enemy Headquarters and the Guangzhou Enemy Headquarters for assistance, transfer enemy divisions to the south, suppress the enemy's pseudo-army war, and reverse the malpractices, prevent our guerrillas from operating, occupy the entire Qiong, and set up solid defenses in various important strongholds and traffic hubs to control the surrounding villages; (2) Step up the establishment of puppet regimes, carry out political and economic aggression, actively develop Haikou City, and massively transport enemy goods into Qiong to revitalize various market businesses in order to seize the money of our people and supplement its lack of military resources; (3) Open up naval, land, and air force bases, airports, warehouses, military ports, and complete the transportation network and transportation stations in each occupied area to facilitate military transport and the development of resources for the promotion of business products. It was found that the enemy's gathering was actually due to the fact that there has been no progress in the use of Qiong for three months. However, since the division of the four regions and the expansion of guerrilla warfare in various parts of Qiongya, they still maintain the active and favorable position. The enemy's plan to map and manage Qiongzhou Island will inevitably fail to achieve its intended purpose.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen and Chen Ce Show Concern for their Hometown, Planning Relief for Qiongya, Aiming to Raise Funds and Contribute Efforts to Prepare Relief, and Requesting Assistance from Overseas Qiongya Compatriots to Proceed</h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese army trampled into Qiongya, the brutality is unspeakable, the people in the island are displaced, and the disaster is severe. It is the undeniable responsibility of overseas Qiongya compatriots to provide relief to their hometowns. Since the outbreak of the war, they have intensified their efforts to raise funds. It is learned that Chen Ce and Song Ziwen, the initiators of the Overseas Qiongya Federation, recently drafted various measures for relieving Qiongya refugees and sent separate letters to Qiongya organizations in various places, requesting them to consider adopting and implementing them. They encouraged compatriots to raise funds and contribute efforts to save their hometown and the country. The contents of the draft relief plan are as follows: (1) Dispatch personnel to Qiongya to express condolences and mobilize the people. Send representatives to Qiongya to express condolences to the military and civilians fighting against the Japanese, to boost morale and coordinate efforts, and mobilize the general public to assist the regular army in carrying out extensive and sustained guerrilla warfare, to drive out the Japanese and recover lost territories. At the same time, dispatch service teams carrying health medicines to Qiongya to engage in rescue work. (2) Strengthen military power. Military pay, weapons, and medicines are the lifeblood of the army. Since Qiongya was blockaded by the Japanese, transportation has been obstructed, and replenishment is difficult. However, to persist in the war of resistance and strive for the final victory, we must still seek continuous assistance. This matter has been planned separately and is being handled. Because it involves secrets, it is not convenient to disclose, so it is omitted. (3) Enhance economic strength. Under the strategy of protracted war and total war, we must strive to concentrate manpower and, in particular, strive to enrich financial resources. Although there are many methods, the most urgent task is to establish a bank. Before Qiongya was in crisis, there was already this plan. Now that the Japanese army is rampant and the country is waiting to be saved, we must speed up the realization to meet the urgent needs. It is planned to establish a Qiongya Bank headquarters in Hong Kong, and branches will be established in various ports in Southeast Asia. The draft articles of association will be ready as soon as preparations are completed, and stock subscription can be started and announced. (4) Relieve refugees. After Huanxian County, Qiongya, fell to the Japanese, many people in the inland fled to Guangzhou Bay and Hong Kong. The Overseas Chinese General Association recently sent personnel to various places to investigate. As a result, it was planned to provide relief separately in two aspects: active and passive. The methods are as follows: A. Passive aspect: (1) Establish a refugee reception center in the Guangzhou French Concession to provide temporary accommodation and assign personnel to be stationed there permanently to be responsible for reception and guidance, to avoid the suffering of unfamiliarity. (2) Currently, there is a sudden famine in the inland of Qiongya. The general public, even if they are not cannon fodder, will starve to death. We have already consulted with charitable organizations to find ways to transport food back to Qiongya for distribution. (3) Refugees who arrive in Guangzhou Bay or Hong Kong (except for those who have destinations) will be sent to refugee camps, refugee children will be sent to refugee orphanages, and the sick will be sent to Tung Wah Hospital. B. Active aspect: (1) Establish a refugee reclamation area in Zhiman, Guangzhou Bay Concession, to engage in agricultural production for long-term relief. (2) Establish a refugee reclamation area in the New Territories of Hong Kong to engage in agricultural and industrial production to become self-sufficient. Also, establish a self-reliance school in Hong Kong to accommodate Qiongya war zone out-of-school youths to learn various skills to make a living. (3) Select a site in Yunnan Province to prepare for the establishment of a Qiongya refugee reclamation area to engage in agricultural and industrial production, because Jiangxi Province has fewer opportunities for military disasters, and it borders Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, which is convenient for overseas Chinese from various places in Southeast Asia to travel to and from.</p>
<h3>Shenzhen News: Our Army Captures Shilong and Presses on Guangzhou, Our Army also Gains Advantage in the Northwest River Battle, Encirclement of Guangzhou Completed Further</h3>
<p>In the Guangdong battle, our army launched a large-scale counter-offensive on Guangzhou from the east, west, and north routes for days, advancing with encirclement, making repeated progress. Shilong, an important town in the East River, was also confirmed to have been recovered on the previous (17th) day, according to the Shenzhen news yesterday afternoon. A part of the wounded soldiers of our army participating in this line of operations was transported to the Sino-British border yesterday for treatment. According to a wounded soldier who told the "South China Morning Post" reporter, our army's counter-offensive on Shilong started on the evening of the 16th. After several hours of fierce fighting, our army was finally able to break into the city and recover Shilong. According to another wounded soldier, when he was wounded and withdrew from the front line, our army was already near Shilong, and the battle was in an absolutely advantageous position. About fifty wounded soldiers were transported back to the Sino-British border area for treatment, all of whom were from the No. × Security Team, commanded by Deputy Commander Zhang Rong. A wounded soldier said that after receiving the general counter-offensive order on the 17th, the battle started at dawn. After fierce fighting between the two sides until late at night, after several charges and hand-to-hand combat, our army finally broke into the city. He was shot and wounded in the fierce battle and withdrew. It is expected that wounded soldiers will continue to be transported today. This counter-offensive on Shilong is part of the overall counter-offensive plan in Guangdong, with the aim of advancing to overcome Guangzhou. In Zengcheng and Conghua, our two armies are also in fierce fighting. According to a reporter from the "South China Morning Post" stationed in Guangzhou, a part of the Chinese army's vanguards has approached the suburbs of Guangdong. The spokesperson of the Japanese army in Guangzhou also admitted that there were considerable losses, but refused to publish anything about the actual situation. The Chinese army launched a counter-offensive from the Sanshui area, making the Japanese army busy dealing with it. Therefore, the Japanese army's garrison force in this area is extremely weak. Even the Guangzhou Japanese radio station admitted that the Chinese army's counter-offensive in the East River has approached the Japanese army's inner defense line. There will be a major battle in Xinjie on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The Japanese army has withdrawn from Zhongluotan. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to approach Guangzhou, and the large-scale encirclement situation was further realized. The Chinese army in Conghua made considerable progress. The troops participating in the battle here are the elite troops trained by General Cai Tingkai of the former 19th Route Army in Luoding.</p>
<h3>Lost Their Minds, Bandit Party Armed Robbery, Robbed the Datanshan Steamer, Our Team Rushed to Rescue and Ten Bandits Were Killed</h3>
<p>[Express News from Kaiping] The Daheshanshan electric boat, which runs between Sanbu and Qianshan, set off from Sanbu to Qianshan on the morning of the 13th. It carried 83 passengers. The journey was calm and peaceful as usual. Unexpectedly, at 7 pm, when it reached the river surface of Zhoumu, Xinhui (about two miles from Zhoumu), because the river was narrow, the boat had to drive slowly. Suddenly, five speedboats carrying more than 30 bandits, chasing behind, shouted to stop the boat. At that time, all the partners and passengers on the Dashan Tai steamer were unaware and continued to drive forward. The bandits thought they were deliberately resisting the order and immediately used machine guns to strafe the steamer, immediately smashing the steamer's engine. The bandit boats took the opportunity to approach the steamer, and then more than 20 bandits with weapons boarded the boat and robbed it. The local guerrilla team discovered this and rushed to the rescue. The bandits relied on the boat to resist arrest and fought the guerrilla team. As a result, the bandits were defeated and more than ten people were killed. Our team also waded across the water to board the boat and captured three bandits. The remaining bandits fled in different directions. Two passengers, one male and one female, were killed on the spot, nine were injured, and nine crew members were injured. The loss amounted to more than a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Japanese Army Fights Internally, Taiwanese Soldiers Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondence from Xiamen] After the Japanese army occupied Xiamen, more than 4,000 Taiwanese soldiers were sent from Taiwan and stationed in the city for a long time. These thousands of Taiwanese soldiers roamed the city's restaurants and brothels every day, and their military discipline was corrupt. Yesterday (12th), six Taiwanese soldiers were walking on Siming Road when they encountered three Taiwanese girls. They went forward to flirt with them. At that time, a team of Japanese military police happened to be walking there and stepped forward to intervene. The Taiwanese soldiers refused to obey and accused the Japanese army of indecency, which led to a conflict. The six Taiwanese soldiers were arrested. When other Taiwanese soldiers heard about it, they made a lot of noise and almost caused a conflict. Finally, the Japanese army sent a team of Taiwanese soldiers back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>Isolated Island Silver Screen</p>
<p>Xinhua Factory House Relocation Negotiation</p>
<p>(Shanghai Correspondence) The Xinhua Film Company's film factory was relocated to Lilac Garden on Haige Road last autumn. The internal location is spacious and has the advantage of garden flowers and trees. It is very convenient for shooting exterior scenes. At that time, an agreement was signed with the owner to lease it, which was originally a long-term nature. Xinhua was also preparing to build a large studio as a basic camp. Recently, the owner, Xu, made other plans and suddenly sold the Jinbu real estate to someone else for a price of 3 million yuan. Because of this change of ownership, the lease could not be renewed. Xu demanded that Xinhua relocate. Regarding this loss, Xu was willing to compensate Xinhua five times the high gold to terminate the contract because of his responsibility. However, the actual loss suffered by Xinhua is estimated to be nearly 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the difference between the two sides is too large, and it is not easy to resolve. If the dispute continues, a lawsuit may occur.</p>
<p>Shanghai Light MGM Mei Sparks Dispute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Light Theater's film screening policy was originally based on second-run Western films as the main film and supplemented by first-run domestic films. A long-term contract was signed with MGM Guosi in the early days to screen all its productions. Recently, the Shanghai Light Theater premiered Huacheng Company's "Mulan Joins the Army" and the business is booming. It has been screened for a long time and has not stopped. As a result, MGM has accumulated many films and cannot be screened, so it filed a negotiation with the theater, causing a serious dispute. The Shanghai Light Theater is still selling tickets for "Mulan Joins the Army", which means it does not want to give it up easily. Huacheng also does not allow it to stop screening. This dispute with MGM is on the verge of breaking down, making it difficult for Shanghai Light Theater to take care of everything. Later, it made three explanations to MGM and agreed to postpone the screening date of Huacheng's second film "Cloud Fairy", which was originally scheduled to follow "Mulan Joins the Army", and replace it with the company's Western film for one month. MGM's attitude eased and the dispute was temporarily resolved.</p>
<p>Three Parties Compete for Renting the Summer Piccadilly</p>
<p>Summer Piccadilly is the earliest established and only cinema in Shanghai, dating back to 1914, and has been around for 26 years. In the early years, it was a very popular and modern entertainment venue. Later, many new-style theaters were built one after another, gradually being eliminated by the times and inevitably becoming outdated. In recent years, it has been covered with cobwebs and dust, and has been closed for a long time. After the war, waste was used and it was opened as a refugee camp. There are still many refugees trapped inside. The isolated island entertainment business is currently in a state of abnormal development, because a Mr. Huang invested 2,000 gold two months ago to rent the theater, intending to resume business. However, due to the age of the building, according to the survey by the Public Works Department, the roof must be dismantled and rebuilt. The repair cost is estimated to be about 30,000 yuan, so I have been hesitating so far and have not been able to organize it. Recently, other parties have started to compete for renting the theater, forming a triangular dispute. It is said that Fang has Lu Zhonglian acting as mediator, and it is likely that Huang will recover some expenses and transfer it to Liu to take over. In these few months, there will be one more cinema soon.</p>

<p>It was a Greek restaurant called Yuan, and they each ordered some food,</p>
<p>"Is this enough for you to eat? Good girl," Harry looked at her ordering very little,</p>
<p>"Ah, I can order more later, but, my name is not Good Girl, my name is Eileen,"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter much, I call everyone Good Girl,"</p>
<p>"Perhaps, that's why I want to protest," she said, suddenly looking very proud, "I am not everyone,"</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm very sorry, I deserve your rebuke,"</p>
<p>"I," Eileen laughed, weaving her hand and stroking his arm, expressing forgiveness, "I am not rebuking you. Harry,"</p>
<p>"That's fine," he replied coldly. "I'm not very embarrassed either."</p>
<p>At this time, the food they ordered was served, and Eileen lowered her head, eating and whispering, "Harry, I can learn those codes,"</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" he said disbelievingly, "That's a very profound and complex thing,"</p>
<p>"I can learn it, we can cooperate very well. In the future, I can see my name in neon lights on the streets of London, Eileen - The Great Eileen - with Harry Fan,"</p>
<p>"You took a little advantage in words,"</p>
<p>"You will also like London," Eileen's eyes were shining. "When I escaped from the Soviet Union as a child, ah, that was really a special experience, Mr. Fan, I must tell you,"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," Harry nodded, "But, we have four more performances tomorrow, and, you are going to dance, you should get a good sleep,"</p>
<p>Just then, someone turned on the radio and broadcast a song,</p>
<p>"Listen," Eileen said softly, "Do you know this song? This is a Russian song," called "One Night of Joy," her intention was to say that two people met in a good night, fell in love, and then dispersed in an instant. Ah, how lovely the music is, it takes me back to the old, far away, icy and snowy St. Petersburg," she hummed along with the music, Harry looked at her in confusion, there was a magical allure in her, which no woman he had ever met before had,</p>
<p>"Ah, what a beautiful story," she murmured softly, her eyes shining, staring at Harry, her lips parted slightly, Harry felt the blood in his body flowing rapidly, the situation was so tense that he quickly paid the bill and urged Eileen to come out. When they arrived at the theater dormitory, he said good night and let her go upstairs first, because he wanted to avoid going upstairs with her in an elevator,</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he also went upstairs. As he approached his door, he was suddenly surprised because there was light in his room. He rushed in without knocking. Eileen was inside, sitting behind the table, wearing a bathrobe, with one of his socks tied over her eyes. He rushed over in three steps and snatched the sock,</p>
<p>"Who allowed you to tie my best socks on your head, and how did you get in?"</p>
<p>"The keys to every door here are the same," she looked at him pleadingly,</p>
<p>"Okay," he glared at her, "Now what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Please teach me those codes, Harry,"</p>
<p>"No," he said fiercely, but as he looked at her, he felt that he was not strong enough, he could not send her out, she made him weak, before and after, no woman had been able to make him like this. For Harry Fan, women were all stupid,</p>

<h3>The Second Place of the Second Division Football League will be Decided at the Kowloon Club, the Match between the Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion Artillery will Kick Off at 4 PM Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The various championship competitions held by the Football Association have been completed in order, including the Governor's Cup, Lai Wah Cup, Special Silver Plate, and International Cup. All these four championships were won by our Chinese team, and there is a tendency to completely win them all. If it becomes a reality, it is a great honor.</p>
<p>It is now the time when the football season is waning, but the issue of the First Division League Championship still needs to be finalized in the final battle between South China and the Navy before deciding who is the champion. This important battle has been rescheduled to be held at the Navy Ground at 4:30 pm on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>The Second Division League, since South China's last battle and defeat of Scott, has ascended to the top spot. However, due to the equal points of Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion Artillery, a final match is required to determine the second place.</p>
<p>This final match for second place will be held at the Kowloon Club at 4 pm today. Both teams attach great importance to this, because the second place is also an honor, and even cow dung is precious and cannot but be fought for.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the Silver Plate Final, the performance of the Middlesex players was mediocre, especially the defense was weak, and they were defeated by Scott, finishing second. The players who will appear in the Middlesex team today are believed to be similar to those in the Silver Plate competition. It may not be easy to win against the Fifth Battalion Artillery, but the strength of the two teams is not far apart, and fierce competition is inevitable. The complete Second Division score sheet is recorded below (Football Field Taisui):</p>
<p>South China Club 22 18 2 2 64 24 38</p>
<p>Middlesex 22 18 1 3 82 30 37</p>

<h3>Da Linzhen's Heroic Demeanor Still Exists, Lin Tiande Willingly Admits Defeat, Lin's Energy Deficit After Illness Leads to Two Consecutive Losses, He Li Group vs. Lin Zhen Brothers in Today's Doubles Semifinals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] In the Open Grass Tennis Tournament, Da Linzhen fought against Lin Tiande at the Hong Kong Cricket Club yesterday afternoon. Da Linzhen has been famous in the tennis world for more than ten years. Because of his increasing age, his bravery has diminished, but his rich experience still makes him an old hand. Lin is young and energetic, full of vigor, and has eliminated veteran Fencha, giving people a deep impression. Therefore, before the start of the game, the general audience thought that Lin had the possibility of defeating Da Linzhen. Unexpectedly, in the following game, Da Linzhen's courage still existed and he exerted it to the fullest. Lin was under his control, losing two sets in a row. Da Linzhen's smashes and slices could be used freely, and his volley attacks were also multi-handed. In addition, Lin's energy was greatly reduced after his illness, so it was inevitable to lose under the 付. In the first set, Lin was still able to calmly engage and repeatedly return the color, losing little. However, in the second set, Da Linzhen's smash was appropriate and his offensive was very strong. Lin's physical strength disappeared, and he was in a desperate situation. When the game was held until the score was two to three, Da Linzhen smashed even harder, and Lin could not resist it. The general trend was lost, and he lost four consecutive games. The overall result was that he lost in the sequel with a score of four to six and two to six.</p>
<h3>Overview of Yesterday's Battle</h3>
<p>After the start of the game, Da Linzhen's momentum was great, winning two consecutive games. Lin's spirit was shaken, and his edge gradually appeared, with left and right baseline slices making repeated contributions. Da Linzhen, in view of Lin's hard work, did not dare to let up, or volleyed and attacked, or forcefully smashed from the baseline, with various tricks, which was more sophisticated and skillful than Lin's "one-way" baseline long slice. His superb skills can be seen from this. Therefore, under full play, he won the first set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>In the second set, Da Linzhen took advantage of the victory and performed even more smoothly. Moreover, Lin had already suffered from going out to meet a strong enemy after his illness. Therefore, in response to the battle, the strength and heart were contrary. Although he once scored a score of two to three, which was quite tense, he was still inexperienced and had many flaws, which were repeatedly trapped by Da Linzhen. The technique of coping gradually became exhausted, and the strength was also unsustainable. The performance was clueless, and he was defeated again with two to six. This young warrior's fate in the singles match was thus concluded.</p>
<p>Da Linzhen wins Lin Tiande</p>
<p>Six to four</p>
<p>Six to two</p>
<p>Today's Game</p>
<p>There will be one doubles final today, with He Jialiu and Li Rurong against the Lin Zhen brothers. He Li defeated the strong Defu Pias last week, with great prestige. However, the Lin Zhen brothers have dominated the island for more than ten years and have won the doubles championship for eight consecutive terms. In the previous session, because the Xu family army stood out, they gave up the throne and finished second. However, their brotherly cooperation is customary, and their playing style is crisp and spicy. At present, apart from the Xu family army, there is no one who can challenge them. Therefore, although He Li's strength is not weak, compared with the Lin Zhen brothers, they are really inferior and cannot avoid defeat. However, it is expected that there will be many wonderful performances in the following battle.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball, Only Two Second Division Games</h3>

<h3>Joe Louis Again Shows His Power</h3>

<h3>The Oriental Expeditionary Football Team Suffered a Miserable Defeat to the South Saka A Team, Losing With a Score of One to Nine Due to Tired Troops and Injured Generals</h3>
<p>(Saigon, 18th Electric) The Hong Kong Oriental Football Team arrived here from Shuan Hua the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, they went out to fight the South Qi B Team. Although the East won by a large margin of seven to two, many team members were injured, and Miao Huaguo and Zhang Jinhai were especially seriously injured. Therefore, in the game against the South Qi A Team on the 17th, the strength was greatly affected due to tired troops and injured generals. After the start of the game, Nan Ji controlled the overall situation and did whatever he wanted. As a result, the East suffered a crushing defeat with a score of one to nine.</p>
<p>Note: The South Qi A Team is the only elite team in Vietnam. More than half of the members of the Bengon Team, which came to Hong Kong for competition last year, are the mainstay of the team. The South China team's southern tour in February this year was also defeated by the team. The strength of the team can be imagined. This time, the East's long expedition suffered a heavy blow, which is a more disastrous defeat record than any previous expedition by our Chinese team. The East's list of battles is as follows:</p>
<p>April 7th</p>
<p>Oriental Club Victory Hanoi Army Joint Team Four to Two</p>
<p>9th</p>

<h3>A Few of the Most Effective Bedtime Exercises</h3>
<p>— —Zhuoyue—</p>
<p>Generally, people tend to daydream for a few minutes after going to bed or waking up in the morning. Whether it's good or bad things, they keep thinking about them. Sometimes, they overthink, leading to insomnia or unwillingness to get out of bed in the morning. These bad habits have a very significant impact on both the mind and body. To avoid these drawbacks, it's definitely not effective to use force or self-awareness methods to restrain them. No matter how superior your intellect or how great your willpower, the results are minimal. The only fundamental and effective solution is to replace these habits with proper habits. Proper habits include going to bed and waking up on time, and having the habit of doing bedtime exercises before going to bed and before getting up. If you can develop the habit of doing these exercises, it will greatly help your mind, body, and career. However, there is one more thing to pay attention to: with any habit, everyone must have the determination to practice these exercises, without any interruption. If you continue persistently, you will naturally experience its benefits in your body and career. However, the amount of benefit you receive will be directly proportional to your effort. There will be no exceptions. Now, I will introduce a few of the most effective exercises:</p>
<p>(1) Leg Raising Exercise... As shown in the figure, lie on your back on the bed, stretch both arms straight by your head, and keep both legs straight with toes pointing forward. (1) Use force to raise your right leg upward, striving to make the thigh form the smallest angle with the torso, while keeping the left leg, torso, and upper limbs as close to the mattress as possible. (2) Slowly lower the right leg. (34) Repeat with the left leg. Do one to forty-eight repetitions.</p>
<p>(2) Hip Lifting Exercise As shown in the figure, lie on your back on the bed, with both arms at your sides and palms pressing on the mattress. Bend your knees high, raising them off the mattress, with feet pressing on the mattress and toes pointing upward. (1) Lift your back and hips off the mattress, striving to raise your hips as high as possible, inhaling deeply. At this time, only your shoulders and feet support the entire weight. (2) Exhale, slowly lower your hips and back back to the original position. Repeat this action up and down twenty times. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>International Game Revenue</p>
<p>Last weekend's international soccer final was held at the So Kon Po Recreation Ground. The Greater China team defeated the Portugal team by a score of nine to two, winning the championship. It is estimated that nearly ten thousand spectators attended the match. Ticket revenue totaled two thousand eight hundred and forty dollars, which will be allocated to charitable purposes. We are truly grateful to the players from both teams and the general audience for their immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>South China Singing Class</p>
<p>The Arts Department of the South China Athletic Association, to promote singing, has established a choir in addition to the existing public singing class, to cultivate basic singing talent. The choir has been established for several months, and the results have been excellent. Recently, many people from outside the association have requested to join. The association has decided to reorganize the choir, strive for further progress, and expand the number of members. All regulations will remain the same. Anyone who wishes to participate should register and take a voice test. If the association deems them qualified, they will be notified and required to pay a membership fee of one dollar when officially joining.</p>
<p>Friendly Basketball Match</p>
<p>The Wah Hung Athletic Association basketball team, in order to improve their skills, will play a friendly match against the Chinese Overseas Middle School at the Blake Garden playground this afternoon at 4:00 PM. Both teams are strong contenders in this year's open tournament. Wah Hung was also the champion of the B division last year. A close match is expected. The team rosters are as follows:</p>
<p>(Wah Hung Team) Huang Zhaopan, Yao Junjie, Hong Xiaotai, Yu Ruichin, Ma Weizhu, Liang Song, Situ Ying, Lu Bin, Zheng Guansheng, Li Yumin,</p>
<p>(Chinese Overseas Team) Huang Lujie, Chen Zhenxiang, Fu Qixiang, Zhou Qichang, Wu Yingxu, Cai Jianzhong, Chen Limao, Zhang Yelin, Li Qianguang, Huang Tutan,</p>
<p>About Baseball Game</p>
<p>After the end of the soccer season, baseball games are on the rise. However, people in Hong Kong and China are not familiar with baseball rules, so they find it uninteresting. In fact, baseball is even more spectacular than soccer. Before the start of this year's baseball season, the editor of this column plans to write an article explaining how to watch a baseball game. If the audience understands everything, their interest will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Two Chinese Chairmen</p>
<p>The Chinese Swimming Club recently re-elected Guo Xian'an as chairman, but Guo declined, stating that he had already served three consecutive terms. After the club tried to retain him three times without success, the general meeting decided to publicly nominate vice chairman Xie Yuchuan to fill the position of chairman, and Wu Jianhou as vice chairman. Both men are well-known in society and enthusiastic about club affairs. It is expected that the club will make even greater progress in the future. The brief biographies of Xie and Wu are listed below: Xie is a local merchant, currently the Chinese manager of the German firm Beiersdorf &amp; Co., and has served as vice chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Advancement Association, manager of the Panyu Chamber of Commerce, director of the Eastern District G section of the Hong Kong Air Defense Committee, and held key positions in various community organizations. He is extremely enthusiastic about sports. Wu is a wealthy businessman, owner of the Nanyang firm Yu Tao Ken Chong and Lee Fung Hong, and has served as director of various departments of the Chinese Club, providing strong support for club affairs. In recent years, Wu has also made significant donations to the Chinese Club's fundraising efforts for national salvation.</p>

<h3>Wartime Currency Situation in Fujian Province – Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes</h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Bank was established in October of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). For three years, due to sufficient funds and good public credit, the people were happy to use its subsidiary currency. Currently, the subsidiary currency circulating in the market includes five denominations: 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, and 1 cent. By the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the total amount issued was over 12 million yuan, with the 50-cent note being the most common, reaching 10,364,741 yuan. The 10-cent note was the next most common, with a total value of 1,267,490 yuan. The 20-cent note was less common, with only 393,292.600 yuan. Last year, due to a shortage of copper coins in the market, a 5-cent note was added from November. As this was the beginning of issuance, it reached 52,500 yuan by the end of the year. This year, a 1-cent note was added. The printing cost is much higher than the face value, which shows that the bank is purely for facilitating the circulation of currency and not for profit. The bank's officials are focused on developing inland finance and assisting national banks, so the provincial bank's banknotes circulate widely in both national and provincial inland areas. People in large cities are happy to use the bank's banknotes to buy foreign exchange, and the bank also provides ample foreign exchange from the province. Of the 12 million yuan issued by the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the amounts returned to the treasury for foreign exchange purchases included 3,169,734.400 yuan in Fuzhou, 280,000 yuan in Jian'ou, 2,288,000 yuan in Hanjiang, 70,000 yuan in Sandu, 689,400 yuan in Saiqi, and 73,000 yuan in Xiapu, 116,000 yuan in Zhangzhou. Therefore, the actual amount of the bank's banknotes circulating in the market did not reach 8 million yuan. In February of this year, the reporter traveled to southern Jiangxi and learned that the Fujian Provincial Bank's subsidiary currency was circulating in that area in 67 counties. In Ruijin alone, it accounted for three-quarters of the total currency in circulation. Therefore, a portion of these 8 million yuan has actually flowed into other provinces. (To be continued)</p>
<p>I am currently living on Moore Avenue. Since there are empty spaces in the house, I am looking for one or three people to share the space at a low price, especially students.

<h3>Sudden Change</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>"嗡—" An airplane circled overhead incessantly. Intermittently, there were "轟！轟！" bomb sounds, followed by the collapse of houses, a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>Everyone uneasily crawled out from their makeshift beds, crowded at the doorway, competing to look out through the five-inch square opening. In the dark, gloomy corridor, even the usually loud and bossy guards had vanished.</p>
<p>"Where are the people—where are the people—bastards! Crawled into some turtle hole! In the past, it was all your world, shouting and bossing people around, now you've slipped away? Damn it!" The robber Ah Xu violently pounded the door.</p>
<p>"I heard Dog Two (a guard) say that the fighting outside has been very fierce these past few days, not far from here! What to do!" The thief Wang Awan said worriedly to himself.</p>
<p>"嗡——轟—轟—" The plane was dropping bombs again.</p>
<p>"Amitabha, bombs should grow eyes, don't fall here! Spare my old dog life! Alas! Alas!" The opium peddler Shi Lao Si cried, then covered his head with the blanket again.</p>
<p>"If you're going to bomb, bomb you bastards who kill people without shedding blood—I, Ah Xu, fight openly, quickly and frankly, white blade in, red blade out! If you're going to die, then die, do you have that kind of guts? Urgh!" Ah Xu said fiercely.</p>
<p>"If I die, watch you not die. Alas, alas!" Shi Lao Si crawled out from under the blanket, but shrunk back in again.</p>
<p>"You say that! You say that! I'll beat you to death first, then talk." Ah Xu wanted to rush over to hit him, but Wang Acai and another thief, Ma Xin Gen, held him back.</p>
<p>"Old brother, why bother arguing with this old man!" Wang Acai advised Ah Xu, then turned back to Ma Xin Gen and said, "Dog Two even said the higher-ups are going to release us!"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of dying! But if you're going to die, then die quickly, fight with the Japanese devils, dying would save face. But I can't die confusedly, bombed to death by Japanese soldiers in jail, how am I supposed to explain that to the King of Hell, and to my fierce old man!" Ah Xu muttered to himself, then he pounded on the door, yelling, "Bastards! Open the door!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of hurried footsteps came from the corridor. Ah Xu looked out through the opening and saw Dog Two leading the way, followed by seven or eight soldiers, walking over. He couldn't help but burst out cursing, "Bastards! You've come! I thought you were all holed up in turtle holes! Open the door, let me go fight the Japanese devils!" He then violently pounded on the door.</p>
<p>"Stop making noise! The warden's coming to release you dogs!"</p>
<p>Dog Two's words were very loud, almost every cell clearly heard. The prisoners were so happy they couldn't close their mouths! Everyone was busy, anxious.</p>
<p>A moment later, the warden arrived. Dog Two, Chen Liangcai, and other guards, along with more than ten soldiers.</p>
<p>"Number Thirty-four, seventeen people; Number Thirty-five, sixteen people; Number Thirty-six..." The warden read from the ledger, Dog Two unlocked the chains, Chen Liangcai counted the people.</p>
<p>Over a thousand prisoners filled the entire corridor. The warden stood on a stool at the exit and said loudly, "The war situation outside is very tight, the Japanese are not far from here. I have been ordered to release you! Some of you have been here for ten or twenty years, some for three or five years, everyone has been able to live by the rules. The state has treated you well. Now that you are being released, I hope that you will reform after leaving prison, and not commit crimes again! Be good people! Be worthy of the nation and your ancestors! Okay! You can go now. Don't push or shove when you leave, don't crowd together, the Japanese planes will drop bombs if they see you!"</p>
<p>Ah! A cheer erupted from the hearts of over a thousand people, then everyone started moving their feet. At this moment, Ah Xu stepped forward and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Wait a moment! I, Ah Xu, also have a few words to say: I, Ah Xu, used to be a robber! Black guns, white knives, red blood, I've played with them all. I should have died dozens of times! But now I'm still alive. I've been in here for thirteen years, I can recite every tile, every brick. The state has supported me for thirteen years, treating me well. In the past, we wronged the nation the most! Now, what can we use to repay our nation? Our homes have been destroyed by the Japanese devils, the fields have turned into wasteland, wives and daughters have been raped, what's left of our homes! Let's fight the Japanese devils to the death! Killing one is enough. Killing one more is a profit! Those with guts, follow me, Ah Xu!"</p>
<p>"I'm with you! We're with you! Me! Me!" Hundreds of thunderous voices.</p>
<p>Ah Xu led the way, followed by hundreds of brave men, an iron team, an iron torrent, going out of prison!</p>
<h3>Night of Damaijiao</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>A March on the West Bank of the Fen River</p>
<p>Night has passed again, dense artillery fire falls upon our hearts; separated by a mountain, we await the war.</p>
<p>From morning until noon, we maintained contact with the Japanese forces; fierce artillery fire flew into the mountains, we left a small number of men on the mountain to pin down the Japanese main force, occasionally firing quick shots at the highway below; crossing a mountain, our main force ambushed behind the Japanese. The piercingly cold wind, carrying the scent of blood and gunpowder, flowed across the battlefield.</p>
<p>The important town in western Shanxi, surrounded by ten thousand mountains, crouched withered and exhausted at the foot of the mountains, without even a sigh.</p>
<p>This is a support point on the western front, and has been occupied by the Japanese for two days.</p>
<p>The desolation that people can imagine cannot evoke any feeling of desolation here. The tragedy of human faces is not death; we do not sigh and grieve for death; the tragedy of humanity is when the hatred in the depths of the heart is unearthed, and their enemies cannot be found; in distant places, the enemies are indulging in wanton acts……</p>
<p>When I saw those victims (our compatriots and northeastern compatriots who were forced to come to their own country by Japanese fascist bandits to carry out crazy massacres). I thought, this is the tragedy of humanity!</p>
<p>Late at night, I returned from there, walking past the corpses; the waning moon hung in the chaotic mountains, the town was silent; I suddenly remembered the Song dynasty poet’s lines, “Ghostly wails remain with the waning moon. Burnt villages leave not a single chicken.”</p>
<p>The Japanese even left behind flour, pork,…… which made us a sumptuous dinner.</p>
<p>"It might be poisoned, don't eat it!" I stopped them.</p>
<p>The aroma of pork mischievously entangled me. Finally, I myself began to greedily eat it.</p>
<h3>A Casual Talk on Three-Primary-Color Panchromatic Film</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>The invention of three-primary-color panchromatic film is a major revolution in the history of film after the prevalence of sound films. Recently, "Flying Together," which was shown in Shanghai, is MGM's first three-primary-color panchromatic film; at the same time, I heard that the Soviet Union's first three-primary-color panchromatic film "Nightingale" will also be shown in Shanghai soon. Here, the author wants to write about the various situations of three-primary-color films below for readers.</p>
<p>The current panchromatic films are different in color compared to the previous films. The current ones are much more advanced. The main reason is that the previous color films were shot with two primary colors. Three-primary-color films were invented in 1932 and succeeded after careful research by many people.</p>
<p>So-called natural color films are actually three-primary-color films. If you want to strictly define a boundary, then natural color films are only a part of three-primary-color films. That is, using natural scenery to shoot panchromatic films, every flower and grass shows its color on the screen, and there is no difference from the natural color tone. If you shoot purely natural color films, the camera is completely shot outdoors, then the director's work will be much easier, because the scenery is not needed. After the invention of the three-primary-color film, the first attempt was with Disney's Mickey Mouse films, because Mickey Mouse films are all short films, and even if the attempt fails, the loss is relatively small. Who knew that the result of the attempt was a great success. From then on, the general film audience felt that Mickey Mouse black and white films were plain and tasteless, which resulted in Mickey Mouse cartoons being non-color. Until the recent production of the Mickey Mouse feature-length panchromatic film "Snow White", it was a major achievement of three-primary-color cartoons. After the three-primary-color film was successfully tried in Mickey Mouse cartoons, the various film companies in Hollywood began to pay attention to this color film. All scripts, stories, and themes that are suitable for shooting three-primary-color panchromatic films are shot in color. In our memory, the success of "Vanity Fair," "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," "Ramona," and "Snow White," is very large in terms of color gains.</p>
<p>Now, film companies in various countries are also engaged in shooting this new type of color film, but in fact, shooting the same film in three-primary-color panchromatic film costs more than black and white film. This is a limitation of material conditions. Therefore, although three-primary-color panchromatic films have been invented for seven or eight years, we still rarely see one in the cinema, unlike sound films, which are almost all sound films shortly after their invention.</p>
<h3>The Path of the Creator</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>We walk a difficult journey amidst hardship.</p>
<p>There is no road, no boundary marker, no flat blue stones, no stairs for climbing. The journey is distant and arduous! Don’t you see the sweat dripping from our brows and our hands and feet covered in calluses? The human ingenuity, enthusiasm, and courage that were advanced to us, all the strength we possess, we use to struggle like a lion.</p>
<p>Having waded through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a heavy stream, a heavy pass, following our footsteps, creating a long, wide "thoroughfare."</p>
<p>We have crossed county halls, we have scaled dangerous cliffs, we have meandered through winding sheep's intestines, we have cut through lurking brigands in the deep forest, we have searched for water sources in the desolate wilderness, we have listened to the frightening wind on precipitous, perilous paths. We have experienced many dangers and hardships, all fear seems insignificant, and the miraculous seems commonplace. The history of life is filled with greatness and magnificence, our bodies, standing tall as the sky, digging and hoeing. With orderly steps, let our sweat drip onto our bodies, let us exchange hardship for a smooth "thoroughfare."</p>
<p>Without hardship, where would joy come from? Having waded through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a heavy stream, a heavy pass, scattered rocks hinder our steps, thorns pierce our toes, mud stains our clothes, weathered by the desert wind and sand, trapped by wolves and tigers at night, while staggering and falling on treacherous paths, we also open up a smooth path for travelers coming after us. Indeed, our work is arduous. But, what does this matter? Each of us has a destination, we must traverse the plains and also climb the mountain peak that reaches the sky. At the summit of the mountain, the end of the journey, there we see a happy "paradise", where we enjoy the air of freedom, break free from the shackles of pain, and recover from long-term fatigue.</p>
<p>From the beginning, this journey has never been opened up. A traveler often cannot withstand the miasma of the wild smoke, or lacks the strength to kill venomous snakes and beasts, quietly resting in the ground, exposing white bones in the wilderness, and the timid regard it as a "dangerous path", although they know there is a blissful mountain peak, but ultimately have no courage to overcome these numerous dangers.</p>
<p>Thus, the "dangerous path" becomes a world where jackals run rampant, the weak are subjected to the strong, and the gentle are subjected to greed and violence.</p>
<p>Thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of years later, it is our turn today to walk this difficult journey. Not lazy, not discouraged, not surrendered, not begging for mercy, straighten our backs, grasp the hoe and plow, open up a smooth road, for ourselves, for our descendants, and also for our friends.</p>
<p>The journey is distant and arduous! There is no road, no boundary marker, no flat blue stones, no stairs for climbing. From evil, we create justice; from nature, we carve out miracles and divine craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Do not worry about getting lost on the divergent path. Look, the mountain peak is already level with our eyebrows. Paradise is also in sight. No need to chatter idly. Just exert your last bit of strength, and you will have already climbed the mountain peak.</p>
<p>Follow in our footsteps. The long "thoroughfare" is created, retreating behind us, traversing the plains, and also climbing the mountain peak.</p>
<p>"The arduous traveler is also the glorious creator!"</p>
<p>Later travelers will point to the "thoroughfare" and thank their struggling predecessors.</p>
<h3>The Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>These words, her reaction to them, were ordinary comfort; but to her comrades, the feeling was completely vague, mysterious. Therefore, among the comrades, some could not help but think:</p>
<p>"Do you love her? Loving too quickly, love is difficult to last long." Or:</p>
<p>"Love is free, but you cannot indulge it and hinder your work!"</p>
<p>After he told his comrades everything that happened between himself and her, they still suspected it was not the truth, but rather a bizarre story that was almost deliberately created, but from her tacit acquiescence, they could not help but believe it. Thus, they all gave him admiring glances, praising his unexpected success. For her, this was exactly the opposite - an unexpected failure; resentment? Too late, crying; the tears of the weak are often self-comforting. Her comfort, on the contrary, aroused his concern, in order to reassure her, he led her into another room - the next room, except for the wall door, there was no second door; if going out, one must pass through the wall door, and the room outside the wall. But there were many windows, tall and wide, and double-layered glass; between them, there was a distance of more than a foot, filled with cold-proof sawdust and cotton - above, there were also black charcoal and red flowers. From the window heads, purple velvet curtains were hanging; these curtains could cover all the secrets in the room. The two places between the windows, in order to cater to the different personalities of the tenants, the landlord hung two uncoordinated famous paintings: "The Last Supper" and "The Angelus." In addition, the furnishings loved by a noble girl were quite complete, such as: a springy small bed, a long dressing mirror, a comfortable sofa and armchair. The most indispensable dressing table...and also several bunches of bright flowers in a vase to embellish people's empty souls! Inspiring people, tempting people with youthful ideals, dreamlike, or providing solace to the melancholic, or accompanying the lonely and dispelling loneliness, he led her to these flowers, he said:</p>
<p>"These are to write about you buying."</p>
<p>Then, he picked a flower again, and inserted it between her hair strands; she used her hand to readjust the position, she said:</p>
<p>"This flower is really beautiful."</p>
<p>(Forty-one)</p>
