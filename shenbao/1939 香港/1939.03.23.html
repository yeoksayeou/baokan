<p>社評</p>
<h3>侵華×軍最近動態</h3>
<p>歐洲時局愈趨緊張，蘇聯的地位愈形重要，其在全世界求自由愛和平人類中之威信愈益增高，其與英美法羅土等民主和平各國的親善關係益見明朗，整個國際形勢，己經開始了對法西斯侵略者顯屬不利的傾向。日本侵略者在此時機，乃不得更感躊躇苦惱之至。蓋利用漢奸叛徒親日份子實行「以華制華」的政治陰謀，已在基本上遭受重大打擊，而日本國內及其軍隊內的反戰怒潮，則正由思想轉為行動，由少數覺悟份子轉為廣大集團行動。日×當此內外危機日趨嚴重而政治陰謀又吿挫敗之際，除了更無恥更惡毒的秘密發動其新的政治陰謀，以謀離間我黨派合作破壞我持久抗戰之外，便急不及侍的乘此歐局動亂未定之時，再度實行其軍事上的胃險進攻，以圖補救其政治的失敗，而夢想最後完成征服中國的計劃。</p>
<p>從最近數日內全國各路戰况看來，華北各地雖仍不時發生激戰，但仍未有重大變化：華南大戰雖在積極醞釀，而表面上却同樣的尙無驚人發展；比較令人特別注視的，却是日×近日在華中各戰區的企圖。鄂中方面，×軍曾不惜重大犧牲，分沿京鍾與漢宜兩路進犯，一時揚言進奪宜山宜昌，大舉進攻陝川，尤以揚言進奪重慶，以圖聳人視聽，而實際上則日×縱有冒險之心，奈無進車之力，故其主要企圖，倒是在於牽制我川陜兩省前衛的鄂西重兵，而掩護其鄂湘皖贛×軍以及長江下遊與沿海×艦的調動。據昨日戰報，特別値得注意的是：第一，日×在浙東方面的活動，連日×機轟炸及騷擾温州等地，同時大隊×艦集於杭州灣與浙東沿海一帶，錢江北岸之×亦屢向南岸發砲。×方昨並宣傳業於本月廿一日在蕭山方面登陸，將沿鐵路東窺鄞縣下犯金華。××這種行動顯在企圖截斷浙贛湘鐵路，以策應其進犯南昌的華中×軍。第二，是鄱陽湖兩岸附近戰事，近日突趨緊張，修河沿岸，戰况尤為劇烈，×軍並變本加厲，施放大量毒氣，渡河猛攻。其志在直下南昌，已可不言而喻。在×方計劃，如果分從贛北浙東攻陷南昌，進則可以西聯鄂湘之×，長驅進逼湘垣，打通粵漢路，南應南海與粵南之×，進犯桂滇；退則亦可以切斷我腹地交通，加强其華北與東南數省佔領區的統治，積極整頓部隊，編練偽軍，掠取民力，徐圖進取。</p>
<p>不過我們同時還應知道，×人根據侵略戰爭二十餘月的經騐敎訓，似巳深知中華民族之不可征服性，故×人今後軍事策略，亦已有重大變更，而其中心方針，則為（一）企圖由點綫佔領趨向面的佔領，卽由主要城市與交通綫的佔領，趨向於鄉村全面的踏平」—（二）則企圖、消滅」我的主力軍隊和斷絕我外援的通路，以「最後根絕」我們反抗侵略爭取獨立自由的根據。為實現第一个企圖，故有近日在華北進攻我游擊區的掃蕩戰，和最近華中方面的「南昌攻略」。為實現其第二個企圖，故又有其加緊進攻我西北尤其是進攻我西南的必然趨勢。因為×人以為我持久抗戰主力及雄厚外援，都在西北西南，而尤其集中在於西南。這是我們於警備×在華中軍事陰謀之外，仍舊不能不加意防範其西北西南攻略，尢其是西南攻略的重要理由。</p>
<p>侵華×軍此種新的動態與企圖，一方面可以證明一切潛伏的和明目的反共主和論者之為叛徒漢奸，因為他們用反共主和的煙幕，來欺騙我民衆，離間我團結，掩護×人殘酷毒辣的新的進攻，而陷我民族國家於萬刼不復之地！另一方面，則可以證明我們在此國際形勢日趨有利的形勢下，進一步防範與打擊日×漢奸，仍是刻不，容緩！我們不要炫惑於過去的成功，我們要加倍提高對於×奸新陰謀新進攻的警惕性，我們要加陪努力於前線戰鬥力的增强，後方新生力的培植，尤其是×後及淪陷區在游擊戰的大規模發動。特別重要的是配合國際和平陣線澈劇發展的新環境，我們還要一面加緊爭取更多更切實的外援，一面加緊本國軍事上經濟上尤其是政治上的進步。我們果能這樣，則×奸任何新的進攻與新的陰謀都是不足畏了！</p>
<h3>新生中國的婦女與家庭</h3>
<p>— 宋美齡</p>
<p>過去的歷史上留下了許多關於女子的光輝的紀錄，今代的女同胞，當然也得同樣以彪炳的事業來點綴當世的史册，因為今日的婦女正在向在發展，今日的婦女具有國家見識，也因為人類的知慧·事業，勇敢學問，與遠大的識見不再是男子的專利，所以婦女們更應當有所貢献。女子旣不弱於男子，而且更具有慈祥與沮和的天賦，這種特有的品性，在我們全民族抗戰建國的偉大上作上使女子更適宜於特殊方面的服務。實際說來，我們中國女性在抗戰中的貢獻是多方面的，縱使是當兵的義務，傲然地披上英佾的軍服，候聽大碾的怒吼，也不是男子獨有的特權了。中國的婦女早日用實際行動來證明她們非常的毅力：她們確能忍受戰塲上的艱苦生活；確能在驚天動地戰爭的怒潮裏屹立而不搖。無數女靑年受過訓練後一拔到前線去，這種勇敢的事實，足使那些嘴裏慷慨激昂地高喊着願為國家犧牲，而實際是隱匿在遠離英勇抗戰一綫的後方，或躲避在安全地區而毫無作為的男子，羞愧無以自容。</p>
<p>在爭取抗戰勝利，完成民族復興的工作上，婦女們的貢献，現在已日見其重要了。男子們說：「婦女占全國人民的半數，所以還艱巨的工作，應該使她們也負起一半實任來」倘，使把這個論調作合理的推斷，那末，婦女是不是也應當享受一半的權力，一半的光榮呢？我們却沒有想到這點，她們所想到的，乃是如何支持抗戰，她們認定每一國民必須以國家勝利為基本概念。然而男子們也不應該忘却婦女們應享怎樣的權利。婦女的要求解放雖是最近的事情，可是，她們有獨立的人格，她們也是國民的一分子，正像她們之為女性一樣，乃是無可置疑的大經地義。</p>
<p>以前，中國婦女們的生活，被限制，被關閉，被隔絕了起來，不准她們參與國家大計；變成了家庭中的一種工具；或者反過來說，好像她們眞的秉有一種所謂「妖媚」的質素，祇配受着豢義，供在闔閣中間作為一件裝飾品。多少年來中國婦女知識能力地位的不能增進，並不是她們自身的罪過。</p>
<p>今日的婦女就不同了，她們突破了向來不許她們參與公務的限制，躍出了阻礙他們貢献智慧能力的樊籠，她們正在努力推進社會與政治的革新，促成國家的發展。在這些億大的工作中，婦女的貢獻是不可缺少的，她們可以供給一種生力與推動力來促進一切事業的成功。</p>
<p>婦女們要負起責任來吧愛國熱忱與忠誠美德深深打定復興民族的基礎。她們應賅保證我們國家的將來，具有堅固團結與永遠的尊嚴。她們可以創造出一種忠信，寬大與正直的風氣，使之普及於家庭，流入於社會，造福於國家。祇要給她們以適當的機會和有效的組織，她們就可以一一做到的。婦女們組織起來了以後，還可以改善每個分子的思想態度，以及待人援物的關係，這也是永遠有益於人類的。</p>
<p>中國歷史上有許多婦女，値得我們尊敬與仰慕；也有若干不足為法，但她們的事實，正可供我們的鑒賦。中國優異的女性，歷代都有，在文學方面放異彩的，則有漢朝的班昭，她著有女誡七章。餘如衛夫人，李淸照與管夫人等，都是才藝車絕，不讓男子。天家稱頌為巾幗英雄的則有花木蘭梁紅玉與秦良玉。居然，陣作戰，登城殺賊，顯出統率軍隊捍衛國家的天才。此外敎子成名，熱心愛國的賢母，更是史不絕書。她們都買獻着她們的知慧能力與優良的特性，保障我們民族的生存與發展。在相反方面也有被認為有害國家的女性，例如妲己，褒姒，武則天和楊貴妃。她們或是造成了有害的糾紛或是予當時君王以不良的響影，使他們昏迷墮落。使國家人民受到禍害。這些人如果照歷史所寫的是事實的話，當然要受到史家的貶責，後代的唾棄了。但是當時事實，究竟如何，我們此時不能毫無疑問，而且我們不能完全盡信史家所言的，當時婦女的品德，惡劣到如此樣式的，因為中國歷代史家皆是男子，故其對於女子的記載不免有言過其實的地方罷？然而近代史上的秋瑾等先烈，則可為我們女性揚眉吐氣了，她是一個敎育家兼革命家，她不惜犧牲一切來進行革命，結果遭滿淸政府的毒手。現在她的墳墓，巍然存在於西子湖邊，給萬人瞻仰，永世尊敬。</p>
<p>班昭的事蹟實在値得我們再作較為詳細的敍述。她是漢朝名史家班固的妹妹，班固死後，由她繼續完成未竟的修史工作。那時是西曆紀元前六世紀。維雖沒有得到蘭畫令史的官職，却也出入宮廷為皇后講學。她並且為中國婦女敎育確立了一個著名的原則：就是人人共曉的三從四德，她主張的「二從」，即未嫁從父，旣嫁從夫，夫死從子。「四德」為婦德，婦言，婦容和婦功，她以為完美的女件應當是平庸的。這種敎條雖然阻礙了女性的發展，但在她那個時期和環境中，則也很為適合的。</p>
<p>現今的批評者，讀了班昭的著作，他們以為這種主張足以妨害女性的發展，抑低了她們的地位。幾百年來，三從四德的學說推波助瀾地加强了男子阻抑女性的權威，把女性閉置在家庭裏，阻塞了她們參與公衆生活社會生活的慾望。中國女性直到現在方能從苦痛的波壓迫生活中解放出來，班昭的這種主張是應當負責的。但是我覺得，在她那個時期，這種見地並不錯誤，不過現任時代改變了，我們也得隨着時代的潮流有所更革。從前認為正確的道理，常然不能一概適合於懷抱着解放思想或穿上軍裝的現代女性的。</p>
<p>人生的一切都是相對的，所有學說主張都有他相對的時代性，不能一成不變。可是班昭有一種基本思想，乃是千古不易的至理，就是她所謂「德重於才」。在我看來，一個完美的女性，能够才德兼備，當然最好，若使我們不得不於「才」「德」二者之中選擇一種，無寧以德為先而以才為後。換一句話說：就是德性重於一切。</p>
<p>凡是靑年女子都應當把這個眞理牢記在心，變成她們永恒不變的信念，婦女自尊心的培養，是造成人格與一切事業的基礎，在最易誤入歧途的靑春時期，唯有注重品德纔可以抵抗現代卑靡生活的誘惑，避免男女同學間所常有的不良現象。</p>
<p>從前婦女生活的弊端在於束搏過嚴，現在合她們以自由，又病在放縱太甚。年輕女性們驟然脫離了父母的約束，尙未習慣於獨立與自由，要戰勝因此而發生的危險，非具堅定的意志不可。放縱與恣肆，往往被誤認為自由的眞義，這是很可痛心的，但大半還是做父母者的責任。或許因為高壓的舊家庭制度取銷得太驟然了。或許因為靑年們不受敎得的亂動來得太猛烈了，使得做父母的倉皇失措，沒有心思也沒有從容餘暇來替他們作心靈上的調整，建立起基本的保障以應付這新的時代。靑年們遂晚出了編勒的野馬，很難駕馭。現在祇有讓敎育家，用他們的知慧與道德經驗，把靑年們沸騰的活力與熱心引導到有利國家的工作上去。</p>
<p>一股家庭的父母，若不能完全約束他們的孩子，也應當重複負起敎導的責任來對於成年的幼輩，應該以身作則，少乍空泛的吿誡。靑年們對於那種重複不變的訓誡容易感到厭倦，倘若父毋的行為與吿誡的言詞不相符合，更不能引起他們的注意了。任何女子，倘若她要對國家的進展有所貢獻，一定是賢妻良母，同時是良好的國民，我們敎導後輩，也應當以此作為標準。她若不能做一個良好的國民，就不能做一個賢妻良母，反之，不能作賢妻良母的人，也就决不是一個良好的國民。並且她對國家對自已也一定不會不什慶實獻的。</p>
<p>現代母親的職責無異於古代的母親，不過現代的職責更重大了。從前有許多苦心敎子的母親，不僅敎導子女為家庭中一個鍵全分子，還要把她們的子女扶育成有益國家的良好公民，遭種原則在目前更有迫切的需要。丙為正有一羣侵略我們國土的殘暴敵人有待我們去努力廢除，正有許多敵人給我們的不良影響有待我們去洗滌與掃蕩，這個抗戰建國的事業是需要緊忍已久的努力的，如果當今的一代來不及完成復興民族的大業，不能够完全渝雪敵人對我們國家和可胞候略與殺奸淫據掠等一切恥辱，就要由後起的一輩，再接再厲，負起繼續完成這任務的賣任。</p>
<p>在抗戰中間，產生了不少値得我們崇敬的人物，這些人多半是得力于母敎的，他們的母親已經完成了訓導扶育的責任，可是，今日的母親，她們對於國家對於後一輩所負的職責比較起來更為重大。因為我們要完成抗戰建國的事業，就必須培育出多數的人才，繼續担當衝破艱難的工作。這種艱巨的工作，應當由做母親的先從她們本身做起。先得在人格方面作勇敢的改進，她們必須革除怯弱自私和冷淡旁觀的缺點，確立起為抗戰而不斷工作的意願。現在正有許許多多的工作待知識分子去努力。若干受過敎育的婦女，切不要一出了嫁，就將她愛國熱烈的腦筋，藏到冰箱裏去的一樣了，竟使她們的心智變成萎靡枯木，如同死灰一樣的狀態，應當立刻自反自勵，鼓舞起愛國的熱情，竭盡國民一份子的天職，否則，政府和社會，應該用積極的方法，推動她們，甚至要强制她們出來使她們來共同負荷救國的担子。</p>
<p>這不是優哉遊哉的時候，大家應當知道，醉生夢死不肯負責的人，若不在這次戰爭結束以前受到淘汰，也必難逃於歷史的批判、她們將受羣衆的蔑視，舉國的唾棄，因為這種習慣是可恥的而且無異於叛國。凡是兒子快要成年的母親，應當訓練他們，把他們貢獻到救國的工作上去；凡是兒子已屆成年的，應當鼓勵他們肩起槍桿來保護他們祖先的大好遺產，把汚辱我們國土，蹂躪我們的女同胞的萬里敵人完全趕定。</p>
<p>抗戰得到勝利以後，我們仍有許多工作要做，在殘破了的國土的灰燼上，必須締造起一個新中國來。凡是做母親的人，應當開導她們兒女的心靈，準備着這種千載一時的偉大事業。我們的心理習慣有了改變以後，天良的覺悟必能迅速地顯現出來。根據這種覺悟，必能驅使每個人民嚴肅而有效地負担國家的工作，進整個民族的利益。大學上曾載孔子的明訓曰：</p>
<p>「心正而後身修，身修而後家齊，家齊而後國治，國治而後天下平。」</p>
<p>這幾句名言，在這國家有極度需要的時候，足以鼓勵全國的女同胞，把我們所有的能力和熱誠，貢獻到大家共同努力的目標上，盡我們的心，盡我們的力，帮助在奮鬥中的祖國，戰敗萬惡的×人，然後我們可以揚眉吐氣地高喊着：Resurgam——「我將再起！」</p>
<h3>關於婦女義務敎育的衫實施</h3>
<p>— 秋虹</p>
<p>三月十七號申報載：香港婦女紀念三八節籌備會通過今後工作實施大綱，主要點是；甲，提倡與實施民衆敎育，乙，提倡國貨運動，丙，加强與擴大各階層婦女組織，丁，推廣節約運動，戊，參加戰時訓練，巳，援助幷優待軍人家屬及積極兒童保育案，庚，擴大國際宣傳，辛，提倡婦女生產事業等……這一次議决的通過，是有着非常偉大的意義的，這一計劃是完全正確，而且是適合目前的迫切需要的：當前我們的主要任務，抵是如何使這一計劃實現。我願意提出我的意見，希望能和我們婦運工作的同志們討論一下。</p>
<p>我認為在目前廣大的婦女羣衆的覺悟程度，及組織力量，仍非常低微薄弱的；在這樣的客觀形勢下，我們不能不加緊把重心放在敎育工作方面，祗有加緊的實施廣泛的民衆敎育，給與各階層的婦女以正確的認識，健全的組織，才能順利的完成動員廣大的婦女參戰的任務！</p>
<p>如何實施婦女的民衆敎育呢？</p>
<p>第一：要做到能够眞正的深入廣大羣衆中去。在過去，很多社團曾經辦過不少民衆學校，但成績並未見好；招生時化了九牛二虎之力，也招不多學生，或者到開學時候來得很多，過了一，二個月以後，學生漸漸跑光了。這泉因是我們這些同志們的工作計劃與工作方式，實際上只是闔房內的並不適合客觀上的需要，更不照顧到容觀的環境。沒有看淸楚她們是要在怎樣的地方，敎育怎樣的人，要用怎樣的方法和方式，要給以怎梯的材料。現在，我們是應該運用這些經騐敎訓的了。</p>
<p>首先，我們要爭取家屬和工廠方面的同情，過去有許多工友是因為工廠方面的，或家庭的種種原因，而不敢出來念書和參加救亡運動，婦女團體的，我們要了解這些被壓迫羣衆的困難，善於替他們解决這些因難，善於說服這些頑固的家長，和偏見的廠主，管工；爭取婦女的求學自由，參加救亡運動的自由，參加婦女團體的自由，而且在工作的方法方式上，盡量避免給他們（家庭，廠方）多餘的誤會。</p>
<p>其次，注意學生們的時間和精神。上課時間不和工作時間衝突，也不要太多太畏了：不要隨便埋怨學生懶惰，要了解他們的苦處，盡可能遷就她們的時間，最好是能够爭取到工廠依照香港勞工法，女工做工不得過了夜間八時以後的規例。那末就更能給女工們以學習的機會。</p>
<p>再次，課程的內容，也是非常要緊的—我們不能開上合口都是抗戰理論，也不能老是那麽一套的尺牘句解，論說啓蒙等，我們的課程，應該是適合學生們的要求，同時也要適合時代的要求的：要她們在求知中，得到抗戰的認識，同時在抗戰的認識中，提高她們學習的精神。祇有，樣的內容的敎育，才是最有實際用處的敎育。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要注意一股勞動婦女的經濟能力，盡可能做到完全免費的義務敎育，不要做得像許多掛羊頭賣狗肉的「所謂義學」一樣，不收學費，都收一，二元的保證金，或將堂費，雜費加幾倍的徵收，結果還是把康大的羣衆拒絕於門外的。</p>
<p>第二：我們要動員千千百百的智識婦女，女學生，來負責這些敎育工作。沒有敎員，學校最辦不成的；尤其是做這權廣泛的工作，更需很多負責的幹部；應該用敎育服務團，或義務敎育工作隊之類的形式，把許多熱心的，積極的智識婦女組織起來，加以必要的訓練，有計劃地分配他們工作；有計劃地推動各學校的學生會，以用課餘施行義務敎育，要在義移敎育中，不但把廣大的無敎育的羣衆敎育起來，而且還要把已經受過高上敎育的幹部，組織起來，提高幹部的敎育程度及能力。祇有這樣才能進行正確的義務敎育，才能培養更多的婦運人才。</p>
<p>第三：要這計劃的實現，是需要更有組織的領導的，因此，建立民衆敎育工作實施委員會。作為總的領導，製成整個的具體計劃；領導與督促，檢査這些計劃的執行。同時在下層分區建立敎育服務團等幹部組織，經常的集體執行各區，各單位的具體工作，深入的展開這一個有意義的運動到羣衆中去，到社會中去；這樣才是能言能行的工作。獻</p>
<p>每年的三八節，都有過盛大的紀念會，每年的紀念會，都有比較令人滿意的决議，今年的會議應該是明年的事實了吧？我沒有奢望，只有希望這巨大的計劃能完成一二。</p>

<h3>老河口見聞實録</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　庚雅</p>
<p>小別襄陽纔數日，該城幾乎全改換過面目。×機又來投彈，目標似在巍然高聳的各城樓及「明昭王臺」，但投不準確，全拿附近平民房星遷殃。西門外炸傷一所小寺宇，有人在露天作怒容的佛像之前題字：「何物×奴！胆敢作惡如此，上邀天讓，死有餘辜！」但另有圖「事關民食」，令人開心的好現象，卽初抵襄陽時，會見市民攜袋擁擠買鹽。可是曾幾何時，這鹽荒問題又迎刃解决了。襄樊存鹽本多，由於奸商從中操縱，及鹽務稽核處事前未能預防，事後亦未能積極設法補救，致奸商將城內存鹽外運鄉村。以博高價。幸得警備司令部禁止城內存鹽外運，司令長官部幷派大批木船由沙市一帶運鹽來襄，市民才不致有淡食之虞。</p>
<p>從襄樊西北赴老河口，另從老河口北經南陽至洛陽，西出荊紫關至西京，均有商車可乘，交通尙稱庚利。河南全省交通重心，現已移至豫西一帶，準此預測襄樊前途，倘×人未在鄭州得手，絕不敢鑬銳襄樊。可是×人若不在襄河流域獲得若干據點，它也不敢向鄭州輕舉妄動。但是襄樊鄭州，南陽，洛陽，以及滯關這幾倘互有連鏽性的西北國防據點，所有金城湯池，早已養精蓄銳，將來無疑是一個衆殲×軍的新的台兒莊。</p>
<p>老河口地處鄂豫陝三省要衝，是漢水上下游交通的中繼港，也就是三省邊區物產的聚散地。現在雖處非常時期，商業依然很發達，特別在夜晚八九時許，全市燈光輝煌，國人來往如鯽，眞是內地不易多見的繁榮孜市；雖然這是白晝防空捉成的畸形。</p>
<p>老河口原是光化縣的一個小鎭，亦如沙市之與荊州關係同然，行政權雖還操之在縣，但人口和商業，經濟重心，均矗落於交通便利的小鎭上來了。年深日久，附庸蔚爲大國，於是老河口和沙市便有今日之繁華景象，同時警察也一躍而直屬於省政府去了。</p>
<p>赴街頭巡禮，見車站初從前錢解來兩個俘虜：一個是司憐的山東同胞，被×人驅至前綫來當砲火，神經已錯亂，惟知大罵「韓復渠賣國賊」不已，一個是相當倔强的日本人，他還會如野馬似的用蹄踢觀衆，他會咿唔咆哮，愈引得觀衆看猴戲似的包圍後來，有人和他攀談，他只寫出幾個蚯蚓般的大字說，他是日本大租界」人，名「梅生漢」，「義父母——王明」，「打倒日帝國主義」。他寫「打倒日帝國主義一時，據解他的人說：他經過有權語的地方，總要留心看者，有人問他，便照着殘缺不完地寫出幾條來。意思是說他投機華倣，非出自眞心領悟——想想倒不見得吧。他們起身時，他吃剩一塊大餅，善意地遞給小孩而小孩不要。一小足婦人蹣跚地追來看他，有熟人指其手中新買電木盌戲曰：「這就是他們製造的仇貨！」她向這個日本人並个曾瞥着一眼，便滿懷羞愧似的轉身去尋售主理論。</p>
<p>出老河口北關五六里，就到光化縣城。望遙路西四五里處，楊柳成林中，郝瓦屋數間，傳卽「周伍子胥故里」，路旁尙有碑爲誌。這一帶駐紮養前在蘆構播放第一砲的英勇戰士。他們有點小規矩，坐人力車出入城門，須下車步行，否則車夫要被守兵責熏。有些認爲麻煩，常提出抗議。其實要叫下車大概是便于檢查，非如×人强迫我失陷區同胞行脫帽禮可比。</p>
<p>通化皴中的街道，倒很坦直，不過人口稀少。令人感覺冷靜。去冬會被×機投彈轟炸兩次，死傷二十餘人。老河口以前亦常被×機投彈，但自破獲意籍敎士間諜案，直到現在，雖不時警鐘頻傳，尙未再遭慘炸。</p>
<p>這次國際間諜案的破獲，當事人卻煞費苦心。據友人××隊大隊長周得位兄談：當九江發生戰事時，就預感到此間有人用無線電供給×方情報。有次朱德將軍途經此閒，下塌某飯店，不到四小時。×機卽向該飯店投彈轟炸。雖斷定天主堂意籍敎士卽為間諜者，可是因治外法權限制，軍警不便擅入敎堂，搜取証據。</p>
<p>後來有一位被人目擊執袴子弟的李某，激于愛國熱忱，自吿奮勇，願動助破案。先結識敎堂中的兩個工人，去和他們睡覺，半夜起身但祭數次，仍未發現電機踪影。不過在工人聞談口吻中。略有蛛絲馬跡而已。</p>
<p>警察局欲急於破案，將兩工人抓去審問，不但毫無口供，目有惹起交涉之勢；于是李某更獻一苦肉計，請以嬟疑罪名，捕他和兩工人同受刑詢，入伙幷同拘一屆，三人互相撫傷慰問，李某才詢得意籍教士確是相殷電機供給日本情報的國際間諜。軍警按圖索驥，果將該項電機在一審問中拽獲，于是案情大白。</p>
<p>那兩個意籟間諜敎士，真刁狡萬分，一方面向老河口軍民悔過認錯，他方面又電請我政，從寬發落，念其在老河口做了多年的慈善事業，不要把他們驅逐出境。現時他們已由數堂遷居盛家坑，在我軍警監視中。</p>
<p>這樣從實發落，未免太便宜了他們：因爲他們平時做的慈善事案，正是藉它來做間導工作的掩護呀。</p>
<p>不過那位平案被人看不起的李某，此刻竟不惜肉體吃苦，補助章警力量所不遠，而確立破案大功，這到是很値得人家欽佩，同時也値得大家效法，肅淸各地間諜漢奸機關！</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>可怕的「增加」和「發達」</h3>
<p>「增加」和「發達」，平常都是好名詞，但今天本港新聞裏所載關於「增加」和「發達」的消息，却是可怕的：</p>
<p>第一個消息是日貨輸入，上月份的統計，較去年同月大爲增加。我們想一想，本港居民，十份之九以上是我們中國人，這個日貨輪入增加的消息，豈不是對於我們的一種無情的可怕的侮辱？雖然這種侮辱是輪不到最大多數的僑胞身上，而要由少數奸商等負責，但是我們不能看看英國美國和印度等等抵制日貨運動的熱烈淸形嗎？</p>
<p>第二個消息是抗戰期內本港與樂事業的突形發達，當然這種事業發達的最大功臣，是我們那些有錢享樂的高等難民！然而做了本港娛樂事業的功臣，就不免做了中華祖國的不肖子孫了！我們不是希望大家不要娛樂，但在抗戰期內却去助長人家的娛樂事業，則不能不算是個可怕的消息。希望有錢娛樂的人，同時想想炮火下的祖國和苦難中的同胞吧！</p>
<h3>可敬的三萬七千萬</h3>
<p>印度牧師蒙度路近日抵港，據談三萬萬七千萬印度人民，均願為中華民族抗日戰爭的後盾。又謂印度各教一致抵制日貨，各商店亦自動停止採辦。</p>
<p>中國抗戰不僅在求自己民挨獨立自由與幸福，同時亦爲保衛世界和半與正義而抵抗共同×人，印度民衆與我利害完全一致，中印兩大古文明民族今日實應親密携手共同反抗這些人類文明的蟊賊，印度民族最近在其英明前進的領袖尼赫魯先生等領導之下，忠實執行民族統一戰綫，為反對法西斯反對侵略共求解放而奮鬥，我們應該對印度英勇的領導者及三萬萬七千萬戰友獻致崇高的民族敬禮，並祝兩大文明先進民族偉大勝利的前途。</p>
<h3>曾仲鳴氏殉×</h3>

<h3>新加坡日僑　確有間諜行為　英已答覆日本抗議　搜查係按法律而行</h3>

<p>【路透社匈京廿二日電】匈國雖未正式一致動員、但官方幷不否涊、業有數千人已奉命入伍、此閒所見、顯示軍事步驟仍將繼續、</p>
<p>【美聯社倫敦廿二日電】據倫敦「泰暗士報」駐匈京訪員今晨宣稱、證實匈軍確在進行動員、其實數目、殊難探知、唯信甚龐大耳、此項動員、完全對羅馬尼亞而發、昨日巴黎匈公使官雖否認此說、但匈政府則在匈京發表官報、證實確已下令部份動員、該官報謂、因務國在匈境集中重兵、匈政府不能不採取此項措施、而爲咸脅之例常囘答、匈羅兩國軍隊頃巳在邊界互相對峙但尙無轉於嚴重發展之象徵、</p>
<p>【中央社羅京廿一日電】、匈牙利國佔據盧森尼亞後、德國態度如何、此間政界人士頗感不安、據謂、德國或當嗾使匈牙利國向羅國進攻、以收同企裁爾伐尼亞省、</p>

<h3>我幣制穩定　英議員一致贊助援華　日本計劃結果必失敗</h3>
<p>【中央社倫敦廿一日電】財相西鬥、昨在下院動議、舉行增强中國外匯平準基金法案二讀稱、英國對華貿易、雖其所佔英國對外貿易總値白分率不大、但仍有力爲保持、幷進一步予以援助之價値、且中國人口衆多、如每個人之購買力能略較增加、則其差異即甚大、中日衝突之爆發、對于一九三五年所採用之幣制、爲極嚴重測騐、中國所採用之</p>
<p>各種技術　上的辦法、極爲完備、同時、其國外僑民亦紛紛以巨欵寄回祖國、或踴躍購買各種戰時公債、以鞏固其國內之幣制、去年一年內、中國幣制一切完整無愁、秩序井然、幷未發生絲毫騷擾、其信用亦絕不動搖、如下院能贊助政府所提法案、則余願鄭重爲諸君提供担保、卽中國人民必能保持其過去之盛贊、工黨議員勞倫斯起立發言、謂本法案可促進英國之貿易、其尤可注意者、本法案可予中國以買際之援助俾可</p>
<p>抵抗日本　故本席極端表示贊助政府法案、自由黨團員曼德亦贊助政府法案、謂直至今日、政府應攷慮究擬如何採取其他行動、以增强中國之地位、阻止日本之侵略、過去政府應付此事之時、出之以狹隘之眼光、誠爲還憾、余憲、吾人應更有所努力、使英國之實物、可以自由輸至世界之任何一角、政府此次提出該法案、的確係實行國聯各項議决案之一、保守黨議員布特比稱、本或以如此方式援助中國、失之過遲、且其爲數尙不距、此余唯一引爲遺憾者也、工黨議員史密斯提出反對案、謂若非政府對遠東採取新的政治經濟政策、則欲阻止英國貿易之不穩定狀態、自屬絕不可能、過去政府因不欲觸怒日本、至未能率先就人道主義之立場</p>
<p>援助中國　八年以來、政府始終時其一貫之政案、此政策爲伺、卽犧牲被侵略國、以與侵略國折衝撙俎之間也、工黨議目丁克、贊助史密斯之於正案、宣稱、政府現所動議者、悉爲過去日本侵略中國之時、吾人未能堅守其立塲之結果、議員阿斯脫稱、余盼修正案原提案人不必如此其主張激勵、蓋下隊苟能通過此案、則中國朝野、定必同感滿意、故下院應一致通過該法案、工黨議員布爾克（蘭開夏郡議員）稱、政府如能設法維持英國之</p>
<p>棉業貿易　市場、本郡棉商極爲感激、無論目前戰事延長至於何日、英國眞正之競爭、當開始於戰事結束之後、如修正案原提案人堅持其主張、則余當投票贊成政府之法案、工黨議員勃倫格稱、如該法案之目的、在增進中英貿易關係、則本席當表示贊助、本法案目的何在應請財相西門樓供担保、至於本法案實施之時、楚否擬模倣三國協定之先例、與美法通力合作、西門當答稱、他國政府過去曾以各種不同之方式、於財政上援助中國、舉例言之、美國卽曾收買</p>
<p>鉅量白銀　至於就本法案而論、余謹請下院視之爲英國對於中國之一種援助可也、財部代表華拉斯代表政府提出答復謂、反對黨各議員俱承認、一千萬磅之數、已足敷實現本法案目的之用、同時下院舉行辯論之時、各方亦承認中國幣制目前幷無動搖之象、過去確能維持其穩定之態度、中國國內對之一致表示支持、情形極爲良好、至於所以指定四家中華銀行參加本項基金之管理者、其原因係因各銀行對於此事之經騐特別豐富、同時其行址適在與本案有關之各地、故以安配此項鉅款之責託諸四銀行、</p>
<p>必能勝任　而愉快、無政府過去應有何種舉而以援助中國、或个應採取何種舉動、總而言之、本法案必能大有助於中國此已毫無疑義、故政府切盼下院能一致表示贊助、因本法案之通過、對於中國心理上必能發中鉅大之影響也、關於日方在華北之幣制計劃、及英方已爲此提出抗議事、華拉斯稱、根據專家之評論、多認爲日方此項計總結果必政失敗、此吾人所大可欣慰者也、如日方企圖以日幣一元兌八辦士半、改爲一元兌十四辦士、則其影響所及、所有</p>
<p>出口貿易　勢必立即停頓、故就現在情形觀察、中國政府之法幣、大致將繼續在各處流通、僅大城市及沿鐵路各處日軍統治之處爲例外耳、華拉斯續稱、香港業經擬定爲中國外匯平準基金運用之地黏、基金一千萬鎊、擬立卽由中英兩國銀行照股分攤、基金現欵一千萬鎊、在運用以前、悉數俘在英國、其所得利息、中國銀行卽可以之償還英國銀行、基金利息暫經規定爲二·七五釐、如兩方于一年以後續訂協定、助利息可酌最提高或减低、法案內所以幷未規定利率之</p>
<p>最高限度　者、保因中英協定或許繼續生效若干年之可能、政府不欲迭次提出請下院加以核准云、</p>

<p>【廣洲灣快訊】邇來南路沿海、×艦梭巡窺伺、×機不斷狂炸、情勢略見緊張、兼以各地漢奸、散播謠言、故人心頗爲浮動、但據各方播報、×以兵力單薄關係、短期內尙無大舉侵犯粵南之可能、目前×機艦之擴大滋擾、實爲其故示威脅恫嚇而已、十五日比間復盛傳×在北海登陸、記者卽分向各處詢問、據息十五日晨、有×巡洋艦一艘、駛抵北海冠頭嶺海面、上午十時左右、復發現×淺水艦一艘、泊距海岸約一萬公尺處、但無異動、至下竿三時、兩艦卽先後向西南方面駛去、至傳×兵登陸、實爲無稽、又查日前　集於陽江電白沿海×艦十餘艘、巳先後向內移動、集結於圍洲島及海口間海面有所窺伺、故北海形勢、稍見緊張、又查新任第七區行政專員張炎、第八區行政專員鄧世增、自接任後、以現目南路情勢日趨緊張、爲充强守土　量、動員民衆參戰、經一度電商聯防事宜、現以戰時施政、與交通關係重大、惟公路破壞、文件訊　傳遞　　、非重新佈置通訊網不可、特　將各縣原有遞步哨、擴大組織、及普遍設立、以期一切政令軍訊、易於傳遞、以利戰時要政推行云、</p>
<h3>財部頒佈　收售金類辦法　省府昨轉飭所屬週知</h3>
<p>【韶關快訊】財政部以銀樓業收集碎金、製成器皿手飾發售、原屬手工業之一種、嗣因市面金價漲落不定、銀樓業任意提價居奇、頗有操縱金價之嫌、當經規定由中央銀行斟酌各地情形、與銀業公定牌價、以　換縱、惟黃金爲貨幣之準備、中央銀行依照都頒金類兌換法幣辦法、予以收兌、對此向居中介之營業、應卽明定限制辦法、昨特訂定銀樓業收買售出金類辦法、分咨各省市政府轉飭週知、省府昨已將該辦法　飭遵照、茲將辦法錄下（甲）銀業收進或售出赤金及九成金原金等、概以具有飾物噐具之形狀者爲限、金條金塊金葉沙金礦金、一槪不準收售（但受中央此限）、（乙）各地銀樓業、應遵守中央銀行會定金價辦法、公定市價、不得專由該　業私講市價、在中央銀行未設分支行地方、應會同銀樓業、依照附近有　行地方、四行與銀權業公佈之市價爲標準、仍不准私行讓價任意抬高或抑低（丙）銀樓業違背　兩條之規定時、一經查實、應予以停業之處分、受停業處分之銀樓、所存各種金器金飾、及上項製品之原料、一概强應售予中央銀行、按照當日牌價付給法幣、（丁）自本辦法公佈之日起、專以收買沙金礦金之店舖、不兼營銀樓業者、制向中央銀行接洽、訂立承受委託代收金額合同、所有收進沙金礦金等、應悉數售與中央銀行、不得私自迅售、遠者應予以　業處分、受停業處分之金店舖、所存沙金礦金等、一概强制售予中央銀行、按當日牌價付給法幣云、</p>
<h3>我馬房砲兵建功　殲滅×鈴木砲隊　西江×軍建築防禦工事</h3>
<p>【西江快訊】馬口方面戰事、沉寂已久、半月來×軍屢謀向馬房金利一帶進犯、皆不得逞、自此以後、卽放棄由馬口淮犯之企圖、抽調馬口方面×部、向三四公路移動、僅餘鈴木砲隊及松野尾部一部、駐紮馬口、本月十七日晨我駐防馬房之某炮兵、部率令向馬口×陣　擊、當向×陣連續發砲數　、命中×陣、×鈴木砲兵陣地、悉被擊壞、×兵傷亡數十人、絕無還擊力量、至午砲聲始停、又河口方面×軍、亦運到大批石屎士敏土、加築防禦工事、並在河口至老鴉洲、及老鴉洲至角尾間、各築浮橋一座云、</p>
<h3>沙面某銀行職員述　廣州之混亂狀態</h3>
<p>任職廣州沙面某銀行之某君、現因來港總行公幹、于日前搭由廣州開出之金山輪抵港、據述廣州詳情如下、</p>
<p>無法統治</p>
<p>×自佔據廣州後數月于茲、對於統治問題、尙無若何辦法、故市面治安、日形混亂、此種混亂狀態、報章雖時登載、惜未得其詳、而×更善於宣傳誘騙、故在港澳派遺大量漢奸、四處散佈誘騙謠言、謂廣州現已如何安定、故被騙者一時不察、致墜術中、日來返廣州者亦頗有人、惟彼輩一返廣州後、目賭此種混亂情形、欲再逃出境、已手續紛繁難脫虎穴矣、</p>
<p>日夜搶劫</p>
<p>現市面居民、除少數因有舖戶在市不得不冒險返市視察之正當商人外、多數爲昔日之流氓地痞、及附近各鄉之無業流民、故彼等日中卽四出搶掠、但至入夜、×軍卽行戒嚴、流氓地痞不敢出動、而×軍期出沒於各舖戶以檢查爲名而行刦、故每日刼案均有數十起之多、</p>
<p>市面商業</p>
<p>市面商店多爲×商經營、正式商店、無一人復業、米糧全由×方所操縱、每元軍甩券「約申國幣一元三四」僅購四斤、×軍受我附部軍　牽制、時下戒嚴令、一　戒嚴時、市面糧食供給完全　絕、即沙面亦受其影響、有時僅以麵包代飯、</p>
<p>檢查糾紛</p>
<p>凡居留者均須領取良民證及通過證、　×軍內部分爲兩派、致市民之佩此證者糾紛殊多、自天字碼頭至西堤沙面西橋黃沙一帶地段、爲×海軍陸戰隊所駐守、此段×軍、檢查甚嚴、不論中西人經過、亦須受嚴厲之查驗、日前有某國籍人、不受檢查致爲×軍所刺傷、故在此段內所有良足證、通過時均須收藏、因該項證爲×陸軍所發故也、但自大字碼頭以東全段、則爲陸軍駐守、市民到該段時又須將良民證懸掛、否則非但不能通過、且有被捕之危、現兩派暗鬥甚烈、</p>
<p>傀儡特區</p>
<p>河南全區、同爲漢奸及流民等集中之地、僞維持會等設立於此、烟賭林立、故秩序更爲零亂、搶刻案件固多、而毆鬥暗殺案件亦日凡數起、故此區域、已成漢奸之特別區、其他市民多不敢混入、</p>
<p>沙面妓艇</p>
<p>自東岸至西堤沿河岸邊、×內懼我游辭隊之混入艇戶內、所有大小艇戶、一律不准泊於該處、現大鍾樓對開沿河東下、已成爲一淸靜之河流、除×海軍之小汽輪外、無一船艇串揷其間、×軍只指定沙面南便堤岸爲泊沙艇之地、故現在流鶯及蛋婦、利用此種沙艇爲臨時妓院、每日夜所收之夜度資爲軍用券二元、此種妓婦、大部份爲蛋婦、此外有紫洞艇十餘艘、則爲×國之婦女</p>
<p>沒收民產</p>
<p>僞維持會自成立後、卽將市內未燬民房傢私什物盡行搬淸、民房瑚貼封、現凡被騙返市民、多向彼等歡納登記費後、即給以房屋居住、卽業主亦須向僞會繳費領囘、此種辦法、形同沒牧</p>
<p>虎穴難逃</p>
<p>×利用種種辦法、派遣漢好、盡量引誘我僑胞返市、迨返市後、×卽盡量收沒市民國幣及外幣、强迫兌換軍用券、則此後欲冉離市、向×方領出口證固不易、卽欲搭沙面之外輪、加金山等輪離市、船期固無一定、而購船票所收之幣價、動輙港紙八元、市面旣無銀錢兌換商店、而車用券又不能售船票、故入市、或非難、而欲脫離此虎穴則恐不易也</p>
<p>示威巡行</p>
<p>邇來我各路大軍雲集、積極反攻廣州之空氣極濃、又恐我市民聞風離市、一方面散放謠言、謂我無法克復廣州、而一方面則作一種示威、故於上星期曾作一次示威大巡行、在市全體海降×軍均有參加、並盡量將駐廣州之坦克車等出動參加示威巡行、以冀堅信我民衆、勿作離市之舉、但除傀儡參加而外、市民多恐有事件發生、均閉門不出、×技可見已至山窮水盡之境矣云、</p>

<h3>僅僅是昨天的事</h3>
<p>克拉克蓋勃爾今日是無人不知的了、他在米高梅攝影塲上走過的時候、那些人指指點點的、無非都是注意着他、可是你知道麽、在遺个同一的地點、他會有一次赤裸着塗黑了的身體、僅在腰際團上一條豹皮、更怪模怪樣的揑着一枝紅玫瑰花、給人大肆喧笑過呢、他這樣打扮由化粧部　出來到攝影場上去受鏡頭試騐時、途中被那些工人們看見了、他們吹嘯、他們怪聲怪氣的叫他、然而蓋勃爾不管、仍然緊握着那支玫塊、匆匆的只想快點走完他的路、</p>
<p>這就是他初次來到米高梅攝影塲上的情形、他在洛衫磯曾爲電影導演里昂擺里摩亞所賞識、約他來作了鏡頭試　、他　期到來、於是先被領到衣裳部去、在那兒他們給了他一件豹衣、一柄短刃、一朶玫瑰、再叫他上化粧部在化粧部裏、他才吿訴了名字、就被說光了衣裳、隨後、兩個人不問情由、把他自頂至踵塗成漆黑一團、「好了、穿上你那塊豹皮、快到第七號攝影塲去、』「這個樣子、我怎走得出去呢、」他抗議了、司是他們說、「沒有人來注意你的」</p>
<p>話倒是不錯、在攝影塲上、奇形怪狀的人本不足爲奇、可是壤就壞在那朵紅玫瑰、一朶在手中的玫瑰要比樹上的十朶還容易吸引人的注意、他走出門不上十尺、就有人呌嘯起來了、他開始奔跑、可是玫瑰仍在他手裏呢、蓋勃爾說他從來未聽見過這許多吹嘯聲、而且那天正好有一批參觀人、使他爲之大窘、</p>
<p>跑到七號攝影場、喘着氣、他憤憤的抱怨方才所受的侮弄給里昂聽、里昂說、志掉這些事罷、這些笨貨、也許明天他們就要向一位新星致賀呢、上那邊去罷、照我吩咐你做什麽就做什麽、蓋勃爾　他的話制住了怒氣、抱着滿腔做明星的希望、走到開末拉前、「這朶倒運的玫瑰怎麽辦呢、」「簪在左耳後面……不、右耳」、里昂說時、由開末拉中閉着一只眼看他、這就算是試驗了、里昂帶他去見歐文泰爾保時、他只叫他們快點走出去、當他們兩個都吃醉了酒有點胡裏胡塗、</p>
<p>這个奇怪的經驗克拉克蓋勃爾最近才說了出來、而且他說、直到如今、每逢他怒氣湧上來的時候、只要一囘想到那支紅玫瑰、立刻怒氣全消了、</p>
<p>紅小生之中還有幾位有个從禾宣佈的故事、唐呵米契、總够得上一個「紅」字了罷、可是不久以前他還是江湖淤藝班中奏藝的人物、泰隆鮑華也曾在博覽會中做過立在門前拉客參觀的職務、羅拔泰勒初到米高梅只賺三十五元一星期、弗萊亞斯担當時在看了他「跳卡利奧加」的壽、一片後、竟願將薪水退還公司、只要他們能毀掉這張片子、可見他對自已演出之不滿了、然而使他得颕晚而出一躍而登紅星寶座的、也就是這張片子、這些怪事、恐怕不多人能曉得罷</p>
<p>你知道珍尼麥唐納早年的一件窘事麽她那時正在四十二號街自由劇院內表演歌舞、某次在踢飛脚待、用力過猛、一只鞋平空飛出越過樂隊的頭頂、不偏不倚的正好落在第四排史璜生的丈夫膝蓋上、當然、珍尼大窘之下、不但因爲光了脚板一事、同時那隻鞋又是汚舊的、她生怕愛挑眼的史璜生女士會對這件事發起脾氣來、</p>
<p>伊連諾鮑惠兒之進影界、亦有一件機緣凑巧的故事、她在「大西洋城」得到了跳舞此賽首獎、獎品便是一張參觀拳鬥的票子、她去了、剛好大導演大衛瑞尼克也在座、發現了她、她所以有今日、似乎還應當謝謝那次拳賽呢、那就是鄧發賽（Dempey）和佛波（Flrpo）之戰、</p>
<p>阿道夫孟郁曾有一次和一位敎授鬧起來、被那位敎授一拳打下樓梯、可是後來他們兩部進了影界、那一位就是烙易　胡亨（Louis　Wolhein）、</p>
<p>一九二六年喬治彭斯和格萊西亞倫在克利夫倫結婚時、他祇買得起一個十八元的結婚戒指給她、而現在呢、</p>
<p>你們也許知道羅弟凡里和愛麗絲費向來有點不歡的、然而你們知道內中究竟否、這其實是個單方面的怨意是羅弟從不和她多說話、見到亦不過略一招呼而已、這事的緣起在羅弟凡里携愛麗絲費入影界之後、愛翟絲費成了名、爲表示她對於他的謝意起見、每次羅弟凡里帝領樂隊東行演奏時、她帶隨同唱歌、當羅弟凡里給她金錢報酬時、也拒絕不收、這樣幾次以後、一次的失和使以前的、好感全消失了、那是當樂隊某次先到了曼哈登的時候、愛麗絲還沒有去之前、羅弟已在　紙上宣佈愛麗絲加入演唱的消息、可是結果她一個電話、說是不能來了、羅弟凡里以爲她故意拆台、就此從不交談、雖則愛麗絲猶有言　於好之意、然而總不得一個機會、</p>
<p>以上都是新沂發表的事、雖則不是新近發生的事、看起來猶如目前、至早也不過是昨天的事罷、</p>
<h3>往事重提明星的怪禮物</h3>
<p>加利占柏有一次從一位牧場管理人那兒、收到一枝銹色斑爛的舊手鎗、是由一個山洞裏找出來的、據說是多年前某著名大盜的遺物呢</p>
<p>保羅茂尼演「大地」思後、曾收到過一份怪有意之的禮物、一份中國報紙一年的訂單、由一个中國人寄來的、每次那份報紙寄到、雖則看上去一字不識、心裏也　開心的、</p>
<p>記得滑稽　　惠爾勒（Birt　Wheeler）和胡　賽（Robert　Woolsey）罷、胡萬賽嘴裏不是老刁着一枝加大的雪茄烟　、有位影迷投其所好、送來一盒極爲上等的雪茄、胡爾賽興冲冲的打開便吸、正得意間、砰然一聲、雪茄　發、僅餘半段、再試別枝、都是一樣、那位惡作劇的影迷讓他上了个不小的當、</p>
<p>露意絲蘭納賈曾收到過一條活的小鯉魚、竟感無法處的置、</p>
<p>賈克　凱每年聖誕節、必定收到一位老婦人送來一雙親手織成的毛襪、那位老婦人大概是像愛自己兒子似的愛他呢、眞的、有像克奧凱那樣的「大胖見子」至少不算頂壞</p>
<p>更有一次一位監犯送了他一條腰帶是用　繩槎成、工作頗爲精緻、賈克大爲感動、寄了五塊錢紛禮物的人作爲酬報、豈料此風一開、腰帶紛至踏來不下十餘條之多、而且都是犯人寄來的、</p>
<p>瓊白郎黛兒有一個常年送禮的墨西哥影迷、送來的大多是皮革之類的東西、她委實有點過意不去、故意也覆了一信、說是她把所有、送來的東西、全部　送給她丈夫狄克鮑惠爾了、因爲他送來的東西全不合自己之用、措辭不甚客氣、自然他要他不再多花錢送東西來另可是那位墨西哥人一點不慘、反而又寫了一信、大意說、旣然如此、那末今後他將不勞轉送、直接把那些東西送給狄克鮑惠爾先生了、果然給以後眞的這　辨了、而且是外送一些適於女用的東西地、這是去年的事了、未知這立先生現在是否仍在繼續　送中否、</p>
<p>普通、送明星的禮物大多是小巧玲瓏愛玩的東西、可是羅莎琳露賽兒的一位影迷迷却別出心栽、送了一件龐大物來、那是一枝挺大的橡樹、雜莎琳把它種在庭園襄、</p>

<h3>今日甲組足球聯賽東方士葛再會師　下午五時在香港會場舉行</h3>
<p>（本港專訊）甲組足球聯賽之錦樣謎局、刻雖尙未揭　、然以現勢而論、續分表中前三名之隊伍、便是爭　主角、又以續分而言、海軍已賽十九次、得分廿九、南華南已賽十八次、得分廿八、東方亦巳賽十八次、得分廿五、惟海軍所餘最後一次比賽、乃對南南、而南南捨此役外、尙須渡海與九龍會對壘、至於東方則戰勁旅士葛與米杜息、因是之故、錦標　勢、猶在互爭中、必須過本週比賽後、視壯前三名隊伍之得失如何、方有眉目、倘本星期六日南南能勝九龍、他日又克海軍、績分便超出一切、卽獲冠軍、如不幸爲九龍所敗、遂少海軍一分、則最後與海軍之戰、生死關頭、决於此舉、惟南南必勝而後可、敗固絕望、卽相局亦無補於事、因是南南奪標與否之重大關鍵、尤不在於圾　之戰海軍、而在於卒星明六之戰九龍、如其能破九龍者、則地位較穩、　他日對海軍一役、總求不敗、雖和局亦錦標到手矣、</p>
<p>東方之積分、少於海軍兩點、因地位略低、衹得坐觀他人成敗、從中取利、惟仍須戰勝士葛與米軍、方有可爲、如此兩役全勝、又間接得南南擊退海軍之利、則賽畢二十次之績分、適與海軍相同、至是勢必多作一次决戰、然後解决亞軍誰屬、總而言之、東方對亞軍猶未絕望也、</p>
<p>今日下午五時、乃東方出戰士葛之期、二者實力、相差不遠、預料戰事展開後、必有劇爭、惟東方是否以原班人馬上陣、頗成疑問、蓋侯澄滔與宋靈聖、足部受傷、均未全愈、尢以澄滔之傷勢較重、昨記者在加山遇之、詢彼今日能否登場、據謂有意休息、將不參與此役云云、若是、則東方之前線少一鐵烏、攻力不無稍減、聞澄滔遺缺、將以於洽興代、至靈聖之傷勢已稍愈、爲顧大局起見、今日將勉强應戰、出任前鋒、調許竟成爲正前衛、準此而觀、陣綫尙屬齊整、以之應付士葛、取勝原有把握、惟望負傷登塲者、至時不再傷、一心一德、爭取勝利、蓋十葛乃軍人、作戰英勇、遇之者稍一不愼、殊易受傷、吾爲東方前途計、故祝其屆時全軍無缺、方不致遭意外之失也、</p>
<p>昨日下雨、未悉今日天氣如何、若老天不予方便、則球人作戰、必感因難、况與糾糾武夫之士葛各員相角逐、尤爲吃虧、故今日或晴或雨、在東方各員視之、殊關重大、如天晴地爽、則東方前線素　擅長之突擊戰略、當可盡量施展、予以士葛大威脅、勝之固不難、若場盪球重、　奔馳費力、誠恐東方之前鋒發揮、未必如意、惟望各員共同努力、設法打破困難之環境、則兩點續分、自然到手、同時守衛方面、須提防士葛前鋒之衝刺、蓋被前線素無戰略司言、惟衝刺至可怕也、錄兩陣如下、</p>

<h3>勝來寫意　南南輕取聖約瑟</h3>
<p>前綫中四人有建樹　獨大樹將軍不居功</p>
<p>南華南自去週輕敵負與警察、海軍亦因東方之苦纒而致敗續、遂使成績表突生變化、然南南自遭去週慘敗後、于昨日對聖約瑟之戰、遂悉力以赴、戰戰兢兢、提心吊胆、不敢放鬆半步、結果乃以五對一之數、奏凱而還、可見南南于努力之下、當有好果也、然其尙有兩次比賽、倘能照樣努力下去、則大好錦標、非彼莫屬矣、南南諸子其急圖之、</p>
<p>開賽未幾、南南卽開始進攻、景祥督師進襲、把聖隊球門、圍得鐵桶相似、未幾、迫得角球、由斗文主踢、落點極作、惜爲門將跳高擒出、聖隊乘機反攻、李安納在離門廿碼處、得球命射、越門而過、無功而退、</p>
<p>已而而祥中綫截得來球、挑過依林士、蘇沙見勢不佳、搶步上前、景祥急交與斗文、斗文不辱使命、一射中的、先開紀錄、中線開球、南南乘勝追擊、聖隊作困獸之門、旋失一角球、由廣森主踢、鬥將夏仙跳高迎擊、球乃反射而出、廣森冉加上一脚、乃做成二比零之局</p>
<p>南南速勝兩球、勇氣百倍、聖隊亦力圖反攻、帕拉刺得李安納傳來之球、乃直衝而上、在離門卅碼交與金氏、金氏命射越門而過、南南反攻、廣森得球、沿邊直上、傳與　群力射、爲廈仙　出、球適落兆榮身前、乃　撥人網、聖隊再度反攻、直向南南門前侵來、幸兩內衛極力搶　、得吿無事、朱幾、而上半場吿終、</p>
<p>是日因時間關係、雙方不作休息、至半場完終、乃卽互相易陣再戰、聖隊見連負三球、乃力謀打破光蛋、地路加杜　與阿路域士調位、故一陣急攻、離覺危迫、惟阿氏內勝球心急、竟于門前用手將球兒撥進網內、然因手術不靈、爲裁判員所見、反被罰手球、南南乃解圍</p>
<p>未幾聖隊又傾師來犯、迫得角球、金氏在門前得機、急足命射、遂破光蛋、南南見負回一只、全力反攻、由景祥得球、交與恩樑、一射卽入、至此聖隊已潰不成軍、完全失却戰鬥力、有頃、兆榮單刀赴會、馬士葵與蘇沙衝前阻之、因而犯規、被罰十二碼球、由廣森射入、遂成五與一之　終局、</p>

<h3>關于梭羅柯夫</h3>
<p>— 鳥斯維奇原著　友秋譯</p>
<p>全蘇聯都知道梭羅柯夫的「靜靜的頓河」和「被開　的處女地」，這　本小說爲千萬人反覆誦讀，他們由此抽取美學的喜悅和國家的豐富的知識，人民的各層和他們的行動的基因。</p>
<p>梭羅何夫的文學工作的力量，不單由于他的藝術才能，他的作品的可　的價値更在于作者是一個布爾雪維克，和一　活躍的社會主義的建設者這事實。每天他多面的參預國　的生活，是學習人民生活最精確的方法，它給與梭羅　夫的作品那熱情，愛與憎，那理想的勇敢，使作者（和科學家一樣）能够客觀的理解生活和在作品中献示了忠實的圖畫。</p>
<p>這是一個特點，所以梭羅柯夫是文學的優秀的現實主義者的一員。</p>
<p>梭羅柯夫是是聯作　最有才能的一個，而且是十分流行的，</p>
<p>因爲作品中有了全般的觀察，他能在諸側面星現了在蘇聯鄉村中的新生活在複雜而矛盾的進行的忠實而透徹的描繪，所以他的作品是卓著的。</p>
<p>梭羅柯夫寫的農民，不是普通的農民，而是特殊的農民哥杰克羣衆中階級區分最固定的一羣，哥　克已有系統的恆久的被專制主義帶到迷途去了，他給與他們各種特權，給他們以地位　陞和獲得金錢土地的獎賞的可能性使他們產生了個人的奢望，更且，哥　克慣於用爲鎭壓革命的工具，喚起人民對哥　克的自然的敵意，使哥薩克站在　立的地位。</p>
<p>這些民衆不了解他們利益是和全體農民的利益相一致，他們自以爲是專制政治的支持者，在這情勢下，很淸楚，要打破壹　財產私有者的夢想是困難的。</p>
<p>梭羅柯夫並不因避這困難，在他的美妙描　了的現實的人物中，我們看見了這些民衆因爲生活方式的根本變革，激起了他們內在的抗拒的陰影。</p>
<p>而同時我們看見生活自身是怎樣粉碎了古老的體系；羣衆向新生活的門爭是怎樣生長和發展；給人民願欲以形式，組織與路向的蘇維埃權力，是怎樣遇到了門爭。</p>
<p>所有這些都很有意識地的反映在梭維　夫的作品中，他的現實主義的才能和馬克生主義的觀點使他能暴露了宣示了這個發展的路向，而不閃避或虛飾這矛盾的人斯主這使他所創造的人物成爲完　，生動和詩化。</p>
<p>在「靜靜的頓河」中的基高爾里，米里卡河夫，亞卡新雅，大米里卡河夫和那它里雅，在「被開墾的處女地」中的那高爾諾夫和拉斯勿諾夫，和其他許多人物爲讀者而活着，抹去許　習慣的固結的人和生活的概念，提昇了對社會主義國家所選定的正確出路的，深刻的內在的信仰，</p>
<p>梭　柯夫作品中還有很重要的一面，就是他的非常豐富的字彙，這有助于他，用着晋通民衆的言語特別是頓河區　體農民的語言，把革命鍛煉就的反動傳達給續　，</p>
<p>他用尋常的科學的直覺與藝術的才能從事工作，，這使他選擇詞句能與方言的結構有了有機的結合，拋掉了純是組鄙的俗話，從這點看來，梭羅　夫是一個蘇聯文學的新文學語言的最　和最勇敢的創建者。</p>
<h3>隨軍錄</h3>
<p>— 麥穗譯</p>
<p>「……司盟通信社映畫部員花房末太郎（三十歲）……二十八日由廣州出發，二十九日在佛山宿營，三十日上午八時半，由軍　　部才田大尉　率……乘汽車由佛山出　，正午抵三水，下午一時由渡邊部隊指揮，乘海軍艇向三水西南約六基羅之九水村駛下西江，下午一時三十分抵河州岡（離三水約五基羅）附近，從西江右岸之高地，突遭×人猛射……在槍林彈雨之下，花房突然中彈落水，……立遭滅頂，急將艇轉回與×應戰，並將其救助，　時花房君的影踪再浮於水面，尙捧着其所愛之影機，俟　逼近，不及拿出竹竿，遂沉沒水中．艇回　窺看，浴在敵人　射之下，忙於　戲，後再到該地附近搜索，已不發見，更請求附近海軍派艇二隻，小船二　協同搜索，……水深三十米，水流極速……巳宣吿絕望」。</p>
<p>夜是寂靜的，在我前面的一枝臘燭，靜悄悄地伸出長的火舌，像是推開了黑暗冥冥的照着我，成　了中國的白紙和墨盒，寫了「故花房太郎君英靈，昭和十三年十一月三十日於三水附近敵最前攝影戰死等字樣，用小釘子釘貼在祭壇的上面，睜眼一看，「啊！花房君實在是死了」，我這樣開始有切身的實感，我獨自流淚了。雖然廣東現在是陷落，不知道以後對殘敵掃蕩取冷淡的人們，花房之死是有怎樣的衛動呢！廣東　落的戰爭，殘敵掃蕩雜道不用戰門嗎？我一　看着蠟燭的燈光，一面在　深　靜中冥想着戰爭的深長越深進到內地去，鬥爭是越無底止啊！（完）</p>

<h3>新寫實文學的生產</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>在文學上，新寫實主義的作品，是有了新理想主義的作品以後　產生的。原來　實派的優點，在於赤裸裸的寫得切實，逼眞而透達，合於事理，這才深刻濃　而感動人的力量强。因爲寫實派以前的浪漫派，由理想而陷於空想，熱情流爲在妄，　浮乏力，所以給寫，派壓倒了。——漫派的態度近於遊戲了，不能滿足一般認眞的讀者的欲望，這才興起莊重戲緊的寫實派。由此可見，在深切的探　問題，愼重研究人生的用處上，寫實是比憑　想來得好，只是寫實派，重在事實的冉現，固然不免拘束：正當社會混亂得厲害，醜惡的事情太多，需要拿革命的手段來急速改　的時候，只靠寫實派把固有的環境現象用諷刺的方式暴露出來作爲對於黑暗方面的攻擊，頭痛醫頭，脚痛　脚，是不足以拯救病態嚴重的全社會的。而且以後的自然主義者，琉忽光明之處，老是　重於黑暗方面的描寫，悲愁的揭示太多，未免令人感到沉悶，處在灰暗環境中的讀者本是够沉悶的，再寫灰暗的作品，自然更其沉悶，感到無出路而失望。</p>
<p>補救的方法是在注重光明的描寫，使人樂觀起來，積極的表現有作有爲的模範人物，再加以鼓勵，使得讀者明白了應該怎樣做以後，就會於無意中自然而然見之於實行，籍以根本改造惡劣的環境。這種有作有爲的模範人物，在固有的事實上沒有現成的模型可用，只好由作者處構起來，這就是新理想主義的特徵。　如以前，對於寇日的侵略，　情的壓迫，還沒有能够實行抵抗的人物可以作爲現成的校型：可是抗戰總得準備，在文學上總得鼓吹抗戰，所以那時的所謂民族主義文學，原是準備抗戰的宣傳品，除利用古代民族英雄的故事籍以激勵以外，只好採用新理想主義的手段虛構模範人物，由此可見，人物要虛構在非唯美派的人生文學上，原是不得已的事悄：要是有現成的模型可用，不但省事，而且來得切實。也是容易動人的</p>
<p>現在可好了，正式抗戰一年半多以來，在激烈的民族革命的門爭中，許多在前方面　陷陣浴血殺×的忠男的將士，都是後方靑年的　範。慷慨激昂，爲國捐驅的先烈們的故事，就是足以故　後生的好題材。更其是在各處奮鬥的遊擊隊，他們的刻苦耐勞的活動情形，和勝利失敗的各種經過，都很可以給一般的民衆做參考資料，做他們的表率，激　他們去實行參戰。或者切切實實的準備起來以防×人的侵犯。這些事實，雖雖然是已然的；但在未曾參與其事的人，正是求之不得的理想事物。要從理想中採用題材，無非因爲已然的事實上不敷應用；有了這許多有聲有色的事實；何樂而不用呢？</p>
<p>照着這種新　實紀錄起來的就是新寫實的作品，雖然是「再現」的，却和一般新理想主義的作品，同樣有着「表現」的作用。不但可以在我國多數人之間作爲示範的宜傳品，也復可以推廣到各被壓迫的弱小民族間去活用。因爲遭種事實，都是團結奮門抗强自衛的模範行爲。</p>
<p>所謂新寫實主　的文學，並非寫作的方法來得新穎，而是新在題材的性質上的，面且這新，並非只是「最近才有」的意思，原是　在抗　扶歸，共同　護正義人道等條件的。新寫　主義的作品，以前除蘇聯文學以外很少見到，因爲只有在蘇聯的大革命中才多着這種事實。以後我們也可以有許多新寫實的文學了。雕然性質稍有不同，寫實而能示範和鼓動的功用却是一樣的。無論像「　流」中的信仰堅定而紉鬥的精神，使「毀滅」和「一週間」中的不怕犧牲的精神，我們都有了，像那「第十四號」中的主角，我們也巳有了。且不語苦戰十年行軍萬里的經過：那八百壯士和　山孤軍困鬥的事實；以及各戰塲上忠勇將士們的奮不顧身的壯舉，都可以寫成動人的傑作。</p>
<p>大量的新寫實文學的出，現在我國將要成爲對日抗戰的副產品。</p>

<h3>Recent Movements of the Invading Japanese Army</h3>
<p>As the situation in Europe becomes increasingly tense, the position of the Soviet Union becomes ever more important. Its prestige among freedom-loving and peace-loving people around the world is also increasing. Its friendly relations with democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Russia, and Turkey are becoming clearer. The entire international situation has begun to show a trend that is clearly unfavorable to fascist aggressors. At this moment, the Japanese aggressors cannot help but feel extremely hesitant and distressed. Their political conspiracy to "use Chinese to control Chinese" by using Chinese traitors, rebels, and pro-Japanese elements has suffered a major blow at its foundation. The anti-war surge within Japan and its army is transforming from thought to action and from a small number of enlightened individuals to a broad group movement. As Japan faces increasingly serious internal and external crises and the failure of its political conspiracy, it has resorted to launching new, even more shameless and vicious secret political schemes to sow discord among our parties and undermine our sustained resistance. It is also eagerly taking advantage of the unsettled European situation to once again carry out risky military offensives, attempting to remedy its political failure and dreaming of finally completing its plan to conquer China.</p>
<p>Judging from the war situation across the country in the past few days, fierce battles still occur from time to time in various parts of North China, but there have been no major changes. Although a major battle in South China is actively brewing, on the surface, there are no surprising developments either. What is particularly noteworthy is the recent Japanese attempt in various war zones in Central China. In the Hubei central area, the Japanese army, at the cost of great sacrifices, has launched offensives along both the Jingzhong and Hanyi routes. For a time, they claimed to be advancing to seize Yishan and Yichang and launching a large-scale attack on Shaanxi and Sichuan, especially claiming to seize Chongqing, in order to scare people. In reality, even if the Japanese army had the intention of taking risks, it lacks the power to advance. Therefore, its main attempt is to contain our heavy troops in western Hubei, the vanguard of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and to cover the movements of the Japanese armies in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, as well as Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast. According to yesterday's war report, the following points are particularly noteworthy: First, the Japanese army's activities in eastern Zhejiang. Japanese planes have been bombing and harassing Wenzhou and other places for days. At the same time, a large fleet of Japanese warships has gathered in Hangzhou Bay and along the coast of eastern Zhejiang. Japanese troops on the north bank of the Qiantang River have also repeatedly shelled the south bank. The Chinese side yesterday also announced that the enemy landed in the Xiaoshan area on the 21st of this month, and will spy on Yin County along the railway and attack Jinhua. This action by the Japanese is clearly aimed at cutting off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan Railway in order to support the Japanese army in Central China in its attack on Nanchang. Second, the war situation near the shores of Poyang Lake has suddenly become tense in recent days. The fighting along the Xiu River is particularly fierce. The Japanese army has intensified its use of a large amount of poison gas and launched fierce attacks across the river. Its intention to go straight to Nanchang is self-evident. In the Japanese plan, if they capture Nanchang from northern Jiangxi and eastern Zhejiang, they can then join forces with the Japanese troops in Hubei and Hunan in the west, drive straight to Changsha, open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, respond to the Japanese troops in the South China Sea and southern Guangdong in the south, and attack Guangxi and Yunnan. In retreat, they can also cut off our hinterland transportation, strengthen their rule over the occupied areas in North China and several southeastern provinces, actively reorganize their troops, train puppet troops, plunder civilian labor, and slowly make progress.</p>
<p>However, we should also be aware that, based on the experiences and lessons of more than twenty months of aggressive war, the Japanese seem to be deeply aware of the fact that the Chinese nation cannot be conquered. Therefore, the Japanese military strategy has also undergone major changes. Its central policy is: (1) To attempt to shift from point and line occupation to area occupation, that is, from the occupation of major cities and transportation lines to the comprehensive destruction of the countryside. (2) To attempt to "eliminate" our main forces and cut off our supply routes in order to "finally eradicate" the basis for our resistance against aggression and striving for independence and freedom. In order to realize the first attempt, there are the recent mopping-up operations in our guerrilla areas in North China and the recent "Nanchang offensive" in Central China. In order to realize its second attempt, there is also its inevitable trend of intensifying its attacks on our Northwest, especially on our Southwest. Because the Japanese believe that the main force of our protracted resistance and the strong foreign aid are all in the Northwest and Southwest, and especially concentrated in the Southwest. This is the important reason why, in addition to guarding against Japanese military conspiracies in Central China, we still cannot but pay attention to preventing their Northwest and Southwest strategies, especially the Southwest strategy.</p>
<p>This new trend and attempt by the invading Japanese army can prove that all lurking and overt anti-communist and peace advocates are traitors and collaborators, because they use the smoke screen of anti-communism and peace to deceive our people, sow discord in our unity, cover up the cruel and vicious new offensive of the Japanese, and plunge our nation and country into an irrecoverable abyss! On the other hand, it can prove that in this increasingly favorable international situation, further preventing and打击ing the Japanese and Chinese traitors is still a matter of urgency! We should not be dazzled by past successes. We must redouble our vigilance against new conspiracies and new offensives of the Japanese and Chinese traitors. We must redouble our efforts to enhance the combat effectiveness of the front lines, cultivate new forces in the rear, and especially launch large-scale guerrilla warfare in the Japanese-occupied and occupied areas. It is particularly important to coordinate with the new environment of the thorough development of the international peace front. We must not only step up efforts to win more and more practical foreign aid, but also step up the military, economic, and especially political progress of our country. If we can do this, then any new offensive and new conspiracy of the Japanese and Chinese traitors will not be feared!</p>
<h3>Women and Families in New China</h3>
<p>— Soong Mei-ling</p>
<p>Past history has left behind many glorious records of women. Women of the present generation must also embellish the history of the present era with equally outstanding achievements. Because women today are developing, women today have a national vision, and because human wisdom, career, courage, learning, and far-sightedness are no longer the exclusive domain of men, women should make more contributions. Women are no weaker than men and have the innate qualities of compassion and harmony. These unique qualities make women more suitable for special services in the great task of our entire nation's resistance against Japan and nation-building. In fact, the contributions of Chinese women in the war of resistance are multifaceted. Even the obligation to serve as soldiers, proudly wearing heroic military uniforms and listening to the roar of artillery, is no longer the exclusive privilege of men. Chinese women have long used practical actions to prove their extraordinary perseverance: they can indeed endure the hardships of life on the battlefield; they can indeed stand firm and unshaken in the raging tide of earth-shattering warfare. The fact that countless young women have been sent to the front lines after receiving training is enough to make those men who shout high-sounding slogans about being willing to sacrifice for the country but actually hide in the rear, far from the front lines of heroic resistance, or hide in safe areas and do nothing, feel ashamed.</p>
<p>In the work of striving for victory in the war of resistance and completing the national rejuvenation, women's contributions are now becoming increasingly important. Men say: "Women account for half of the country's population, so they should also bear half of the responsibility for arduous work." If this argument is reasonably inferred, then should women also enjoy half of the rights and half of the glory? We have not thought of this point. What they think about is how to support the war of resistance. They believe that every citizen must take national victory as the basic concept. However, men should not forget what rights women should enjoy. Although women's demands for liberation are recent, they have independent personalities, and they are also members of the country, just as their being women is an indisputable grand principle.</p>
<p>In the past, the lives of Chinese women were restricted, closed, and isolated. They were not allowed to participate in national affairs; they became a tool in the family; or, conversely, it seemed that they possessed a so-called "charming" quality, only worthy of being raised and enshrined in the family as a decoration. The failure of Chinese women's knowledge, ability, and status to improve for so many years is not their own fault.</p>
<p>Today's women are different. They have broken through the restrictions that have always prevented them from participating in public affairs, jumped out of the shackles that hinder their contribution of wisdom and ability, and are working hard to promote social and political reforms and promote national development. In these great works, the contribution of women is indispensable. They can provide a kind of vitality and driving force to promote the success of all undertakings.</p>
<p>Women, take up the responsibility! Deeply establish the foundation for the revival of the nation with patriotic enthusiasm and loyal virtues. They should guarantee the future of our country, with solid unity and eternal dignity. They can create an atmosphere of loyalty, generosity, and integrity, and make it popular in the family, flow into the society, and benefit the country. As long as they are given appropriate opportunities and effective organization, they can do it one by one. After women are organized, they can also improve the thoughts and attitudes of each member, as well as the relationship between treating people and helping things, which is also eternally beneficial to mankind.</p>
<p>There are many women in Chinese history who deserve our respect and admiration; there are also some who are not enough to be models, but their facts can provide us with lessons. There have been excellent Chinese women in all dynasties. In terms of literature, there was Ban Zhao of the Han Dynasty, who wrote seven chapters of "Lessons for Women." Others such as Madam Wei, Li Qingzhao, and Madam Guan were all talented and unparalleled, not inferior to men. There are also women who were praised as female heroes, such as Hua Mulan, Liang Hongyu, and Qin Liangyu. They actually fought in battle, climbed the city to kill the enemy, and showed the talent of commanding troops to defend the country. In addition, there are countless virtuous mothers who educated their children to become famous and were enthusiastic about patriotism. They all dedicated their wisdom, ability, and excellent characteristics to protect the survival and development of our nation. On the contrary, there are also women who are considered harmful to the country, such as Daji, Baosi, Wu Zetian, and Yang Guifei. They either created harmful disputes or gave the emperors of the time bad influences, causing them to become faint and degenerate, causing harm to the country and the people. If what is written in history is true, of course, these people should be criticized by historians and abandoned by later generations. But what was the actual situation at that time? We cannot be without doubt at this time, and we cannot completely believe what historians say. Was the character of women at that time so bad? Because Chinese historians of all dynasties are men, their records of women inevitably have exaggerated statements? However, the martyrs such as Qiu Jin in modern history can raise their eyebrows for our women. She was an educator and a revolutionary. She did not hesitate to sacrifice everything to carry out the revolution, and as a result, suffered the poisonous hands of the Qing government. Now her tomb stands majestically on the shore of West Lake, for all to admire and respect forever.</p>
<p>Ban Zhao's deeds are really worth further detailed description. She was the younger sister of Ban Gu, a famous historian of the Han Dynasty. After Ban Gu's death, she continued to complete the unfinished work of writing history. That was the sixth century BC. Although she did not get the official position of Lan Hu Ling Shi, she also went in and out of the palace to lecture the Queen. She also established a famous principle for the education of Chinese women: that is, the three obediences and four virtues that everyone knows. The "two obediences" she advocated are obedience to the father before marriage, obedience to the husband after marriage, and obedience to the son after the husband's death. The "four virtues" are feminine virtue, feminine speech, feminine appearance, and feminine work. She believed that a perfect woman should be mediocre. Although this doctrine hindered the development of women, it was also very suitable for her time and environment.</p>
<p>Contemporary critics, after reading Ban Zhao's works, think that this kind of proposition is enough to hinder the development of women and depress their status. For hundreds of years, the doctrine of three obediences and four virtues has fueled the authority of men to suppress women, confine women in the family, and block their desire to participate in public and social life. Chinese women have only now been able to liberate themselves from the painful pressure of life, and Ban Zhao's proposition should be responsible for this. But I think that in her time, this view was not wrong, but now that the times have changed, we must also make changes with the trend of the times. The truth that was considered correct in the past cannot be entirely suitable for modern women who embrace the idea of ​​liberation or wear military uniforms.</p>
<p>Everything in life is relative, and all doctrines and propositions have their relative temporality and cannot be unchangeable. However, Ban Zhao has a basic idea, which is an eternal truth, that is, what she calls "virtue is more important than talent." In my opinion, it is of course best for a perfect woman to have both talent and virtue. If we have to choose one between "talent" and "virtue," we would rather take virtue first and talent second. In other words: virtue is more important than everything.</p>
<p>All young women should keep this truth firmly in mind and turn it into their eternal belief. The cultivation of women's self-esteem is the foundation for creating personality and all careers. In the youth period when it is easiest to go astray, only by paying attention to morality can they resist the temptation of modern decadent life and avoid the common undesirable phenomena between male and female students.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of women's lives in the past were that they were too strictly bound, and now that they are given freedom, the disease is that they are too indulgent. Young women suddenly break away from the constraints of their parents and are not yet accustomed to independence and freedom. To overcome the dangers that arise from this, they must have a firm will. Indulgence and willfulness are often mistaken for the true meaning of freedom, which is very painful, but most of it is the responsibility of the parents. Perhaps because the old family system of high pressure was abolished too suddenly. Perhaps because the unrestrained movement of young people who are not taught came too violently, making parents panic and have no intention or leisure to make spiritual adjustments for them and establish basic guarantees to cope with this new era. Young people then went out to compile wild horses that are difficult to tame. Now we can only let educators use their wisdom and moral experience to guide the boiling energy and enthusiasm of young people to work that is beneficial to the country.</p>
<p>Parents of a family, if they cannot completely restrain their children, should also repeatedly take on the responsibility of teaching. For grown-up juniors, they should set an example and give less empty advice. Young people are easily tired of repetitive instructions. If the behavior of parents does not match the words of advice, they will not be able to attract their attention. Any woman, if she wants to contribute to the progress of the country, must be a virtuous wife and good mother, and at the same time a good citizen. We should also use this as a standard to educate our younger generations. If she cannot be a good citizen, she cannot be a virtuous wife and good mother. On the contrary, a person who cannot be a virtuous wife and good mother is definitely not a good citizen. And she will definitely not be practical and dedicated to the country and herself.</p>
<p>The duties of modern mothers are no different from those of ancient mothers, but modern duties are more important. In the past, there were many mothers who painstakingly taught their children, not only to educate their children as sound members of the family, but also to help them become good citizens who are beneficial to the country. This principle is even more urgently needed at present. Because there is a group of brutal enemies who are invading our territory waiting for us to work hard to abolish them, and there are many bad influences given to us by the enemy waiting for us to wash away and sweep away. This cause of resisting Japan and building the country requires long-term efforts. If the current generation does not have time to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation and cannot completely wash away all the shame of the enemy's insults and killings of our compatriots, the younger generation must continue to carry out the task of continuing to complete this task.</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, many people worthy of our respect emerged. Most of these people are indebted to their mother's teachings. Their mothers have completed the responsibility of training and nurturing, but today's mothers have more important responsibilities to the country and the younger generation compared to the past. Because to complete the cause of resisting Japan and building the country, we must cultivate a large number of talents to continue to shoulder the work of breaking through difficulties. This arduous work should be started by mothers from themselves. First, they must make courageous improvements in their personality. They must eliminate the shortcomings of timidity, selfishness, and indifference, and establish the willingness to work continuously for the war of resistance. There are now many jobs waiting for intellectuals to work hard. Some educated women, don't put their patriotic and enthusiastic minds in the refrigerator as soon as they get married, so that their minds become withered wood, like dead ashes. They should immediately reflect on themselves, encourage patriotic enthusiasm, and do their best to fulfill their duties as a citizen. Otherwise, the government and society should use active methods to promote them, and even force them to come out to share the burden of saving the country.</p>
<p>This is not a time to enjoy leisure. Everyone should know that those who are drunk and dream of death and refuse to take responsibility will either be eliminated before the end of this war, or they will be difficult to escape the criticism of history. They will be despised by the masses and abandoned by the whole country, because this habit is shameful and tantamount to treason. All mothers whose sons are about to reach adulthood should train them and contribute them to the work of saving the country; all those whose sons have reached adulthood should encourage them to shoulder their guns to protect the great heritage of their ancestors and completely drive out the enemies who have insulted our country and trampled on our female compatriots.</p>
<p>After the victory of the war of resistance, we still have many tasks to do. On the ashes of the devastated country, we must create a new China. All mothers should enlighten their children's minds and prepare for this great cause that comes once in a millennium. After our psychological habits have changed, the awakening of conscience will be able to appear quickly. Based on this awakening, every citizen will be able to bear the country's work seriously and effectively and advance the interests of the entire nation. The University Records contain Confucius's explicit instruction:</p>
<p>"Only when the heart is upright can the person be cultivated, only when the person is cultivated can the family be regulated, only when the family is regulated can the country be governed, and only when the country is governed can the world be at peace."</p>
<p>These famous words, in this time of extreme need for the country, are enough to encourage all the women compatriots of the country to contribute all our abilities and enthusiasm to the common goal of everyone's efforts, to do our best and our strength to help the struggling motherland, defeat the evil Japanese, and then we can raise our eyebrows and shout loudly: Resurgam——"I will rise again!"</p>
<h3>On the Implementation of Compulsory Education for Women</h3>
<p>— Qiu Hong</p>
<p>The Shen Bao published on March 17th: The Hong Kong Women's Commemoration of the March 8th Festival Preparatory Committee passed the outline for the implementation of future work, the main points of which are: A. Promoting and implementing mass education; B. Promoting the national goods movement; C. Strengthening and expanding women's organizations at all levels; D. Promoting the thrift movement; E. Participating in wartime training; F. Assisting and giving preferential treatment to military families and actively promoting childcare; G. Expanding international propaganda; H. Promoting women's production enterprises, etc. … The passage of this resolution has a very great significance. This plan is completely correct and suitable for the current urgent needs. Our main task at present is how to realize this plan. I would like to put forward my opinions and hope to discuss them with our comrades in the women's movement.</p>
<p>I believe that at present, the awareness level and organizational strength of the broad masses of women are still very low and weak. Under such objective circumstances, we must intensify our focus on education. Only by intensifying the implementation of widespread mass education, giving women at all levels a correct understanding and sound organization, can we smoothly complete the task of mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the war!</p>
<p>How to implement mass education for women?</p>
<p>First: To truly go deep into the broad masses. In the past, many social groups have run many mass schools, but the results have not been good. It took a lot of effort to recruit students, and not many students were recruited. Or when school started, many came, but after a month or two, the students gradually ran away. The reason for this is that the work plans and working methods of our comrades are actually only suitable for closed rooms and do not meet the objective needs, and do not take into account the local environment. We have not clearly seen where they are, who to educate, what methods and ways to use, and what kind of materials to give them. Now, we should use these experiences and lessons.</p>
<p>First of all, we must strive for the sympathy of families and factories. In the past, many workers did not dare to come out to study and participate in the national salvation movement because of various reasons in the factory or family. We, women's organizations, must understand the difficulties of these oppressed masses, be good at solving these difficulties for them, and be good at persuading these stubborn parents and biased factory owners and supervisors; strive for women's freedom to study, freedom to participate in the national salvation movement, and freedom to participate in women's organizations, and in terms of working methods, try to avoid giving them (family, factory) unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Secondly, pay attention to the students' time and energy. Class time should not conflict with working hours, and should not be too much or too intimidating. Do not casually complain about students being lazy, understand their difficulties, and accommodate their time as much as possible. It is best to strive for the factory to follow the Hong Kong Labor Law, which stipulates that female workers should not work past 8 pm at night. That would give female workers more opportunities to learn.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the content of the curriculum is also very important. We cannot talk about anti-Japanese war theory all the time, nor can we always use the same old set of letter-writing formulas, argumentation enlightenment, etc. Our curriculum should meet the requirements of the students and also meet the requirements of the times: we must let them gain an understanding of the anti-Japanese war in their pursuit of knowledge, and at the same time, in their understanding of the anti-Japanese war, improve their spirit of learning. Only education with such content is the most practical education.</p>
<p>Finally, we should also pay attention to the economic ability of a group of working women, and do as much as possible to achieve completely free compulsory education. Do not do it like many "so-called free schools" that hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat, do not charge tuition, but charge one or two yuan of deposit, or collect several times the classroom fees and miscellaneous fees, and as a result, still reject the broad masses outside the door.</p>
<p>Second: We must mobilize thousands upon thousands of knowledgeable women and female students to be responsible for this education work. Without teachers, schools cannot be run; especially to do this kind of extensive work, more responsible cadres are needed. We should use forms such as education service groups or voluntary education work teams to organize many enthusiastic and active knowledgeable women, give them necessary training, and assign them work in a planned manner; promote student unions in various schools in a planned manner, use after-school time to implement voluntary education, and in the process of voluntary education, not only educate the broad masses of uneducated people, but also organize the cadres who have received higher education and improve the education level and ability of the cadres. Only in this way can we carry out correct compulsory education and cultivate more talents for the women's movement.</p>
<p>Third: The realization of this plan requires more organized leadership. Therefore, establish a Mass Education Work Implementation Committee as the overall leadership to develop the entire specific plan; lead and supervise, and inspect the implementation of these plans. At the same time, establish cadre organizations such as education service groups at the lower level to regularly collectively implement the specific work of each district and unit, and deeply carry out this meaningful movement into the masses and into society; this is work that can be spoken and done. offer</p>
<p>Every year, there is a grand commemoration meeting for the March 8th Festival, and every year, there are relatively satisfactory resolutions. Should this year's meeting be a reality next year? I have no extravagant hopes, only the hope that one or two of this huge plan can be completed.</p>

<h3>× There is a trend of large-scale invasion　Our military has new preparations　The focus of the war is currently still in Jiangxi and Hubei　The total number of troops on each battlefield is around one million</h3>
<p>[Special telegram from Chongqing on the 22nd of this newspaper] Based on the situation on each battlefield, × seems to have a trend of large-scale invasion against us. However, the total number of × within our borders is still around one million, and there is no large increase. In addition to those guarding the strongholds, the maximum number of troops that can attack is only a large-scale attack on one or two war zones. Our new military preparations are stronger than before and sufficient to deal with it. The focus of the war is still in Jiangxi and Hubei. × is constantly increasing on the east bank of the Xiang River. There are more than two regiments of × across the Shayang River. About one regiment is at Luohan Temple and Dengjiachang, and Zengjialing. About 2,000 people are in Zhongxiang. More than one regiment of × is at Yuekou. About one division is at Anlu and Xihe. They have been repeatedly trying to cross the west bank of the Xiang River for days, and they have all been annihilated by us. As of the 21st, they are still fighting across the river. We are launching a new strategy, and the war situation is gradually improving.</p>
<p>Jiangxi × Troops Advance South in Multiple Routes</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chongqing, 22nd] A Chinese military spokesman announced that a Japanese troop crossed the Xiu River north of Nanchang on the 18th of this month, posing a threat to the front of Nanchang. At the same time, another Japanese troop also landed in Wucheng on the west bank of Poyang Lake on the 18th, making it easier for the Japanese to launch an attack on Nanchang. Currently, the Japanese army is using an entire division to exert pressure on the front of Nanchang, and another division is attacking Wuning, hoping to threaten the left wing of the Chinese army in Nanchang. They are still rapidly reinforcing from Jiujiang. In addition, 2,000 Japanese troops landed on the east bank of Poyang Lake on the 14th. As for the war in central Hubei, the spokesman said that the Japanese army tried to cross the Xiang River, but after three days of fierce fighting, they failed due to the strong resistance of the Chinese artillery. The Japanese army is currently reorganizing its remnants and waiting for reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 22nd] Since the Japanese army occupied Hankou, they have launched a large-scale offensive in Zhejiang Province for the first time. The Japanese army is attempting to advance along the Qiantang River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The front line is as long as 600 li. Soldiers transferred from North China and part of the navy are participating in a joint operation with the Japanese army in Central China.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 22nd] The largest-scale offensive since the Japanese army occupied Hankou has already begun in Zhejiang Province. The Chinese army deployed along the Qiantang River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is no less than 800,000 people. Japan is redeploying troops stationed in North China and the navy to reinforce the Japanese army in Central China.</p>
<p>Henan × Troops Are Still Restless</p>
<p>[Special telegram from Chongqing on the 22nd of this newspaper] According to reports, Henan × troops are still restless. Since the 17th, × planes have been harassing Zhengzhou and Luoyang every day. Especially on the 20th, hundreds of bombs were dropped in Zhengzhou, bombing civilians, which was extremely brutal. × in Wenxian and on the north bank of Sishui continue to increase, shelling the south bank, trying to cross the river. We are strictly defending and there is no danger. Henan East × cavalry have repeatedly harassed Laitongzhai east of Huayuankou, but they have all been repelled. × in Xinxiang has also increased to more than 5,000. Our new military deployment for Henan has been completed, and the defense is solid.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Luoyang, 22nd] About 2,000 × troops who invaded west from Dongzhangzhen (northeast of Zhongmu) arrived at Sanliuzhai in large numbers at 7 pm on the 20th. Their advance troops of 500 to 600 people engaged in fierce battles with our alert troops in Laitongzhai and Madukou. Our alert troops fought bravely and then retreated westward. By the 21st, the advance troops of the 8th Division, 200 to 300 × troops, successively occupied Vietnam Gan on the opposite bank of the Xinhe River under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft. Our alert troops are still fighting fiercely with × troops. The troops attacking Sanliuzhai were side-attacking × troops from northeast of Zhongmu at 10 am on the 21st.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Defect One After Another</p>
<p>[Ming Ge News Agency Hequ, 22nd] In the Baotou area, puppet troops have been increasingly oppressed by ×, and lower-level military officers have been replaced by Japanese or Mongolians. The × army is extremely shaken. Three to five of them carry weapons and surrender to us. Our troops near Baotou alone have collected 300 to 400 people. In addition, the battalion commander of a puppet army unit in Daxikou defected with his troops the day before yesterday and has now joined our tea troops. Military news, a part of the Baotou × army crossed the river to invade our Zhungeer Banner and is fighting our troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Yulin, 21st] Xiao Jintang, commander of the 1st Division of the puppet Northwest Border Defense Army, and Xia Junchuan, commander of the 4th Division, defected with more than 1,000 of their subordinates in the area west of Guyang on January 26. After shooting and killing two Japanese advisors, they led their troops south. They encountered × troops many times along the way and engaged in fierce battles, killing and capturing countless enemies. After a journey of more than 40 days, they arrived at a certain place on the 17th of this month. The police commander of the XXXXXX reported the defection process and asked for instructions on the anti-× policy.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Jinzhong Heilongguan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xingji, 21st] On the line from Heilongguan Tumen to Linfen, × and our troops have been fighting fiercely every day for the past week. × are constantly being attacked by us. On the 12th, more than 200 × troops invaded Yita, but they sneaked away after being attacked by our guerrillas. They were also bombarded by our mortars and fled back to Tumen. On the morning of the 13th, × troops invaded in multiple routes. One part of more than 200 troops went from Qiaoerwan to Jinfangling and encountered our interception. Another part of more than 200 troops went from Huojiaao to Sanmuli after passing through Sunjiagou to Jinliling. We launched a surprise attack on Heilongguan from Qiangechuan and a main force launched a flanking attack from Shuiquanao. After eight hours of bloody battle, × were injured and fled back. On the 14th, a group of × troops invaded Yuanshang again and were driven down the mountain. On this day, smoke and fire filled the air around Heilongguan, perhaps because × took revenge on civilians for their injuries and wantonly burned villages in an attempt to vent their anger. On the 16th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry, with one cannon and more than 100 carts, stationed near Yuanshang from Tumen and were killed by us. On the 17th, more than 300 × troops invaded west again and were intercepted along the way in the Lingyi area. The remaining × troops fled to Heilongguan and were ambushed again on their way through Yuanshang. The × troops retreated to Tumen under the cover of artillery fire, leaving more than a dozen bodies behind. In total, nearly 500 × troops have been killed in the past week, along with more than 40 donkeys and mules. We also suffered more than 200 casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xingji, 22nd] On the morning of the 12th, our artillery bombarded Heilongguan, and × were lured to attack Dongpoli, Tunli, and the southeast of Heilongguan. The × troops in Dongpoli were surrounded by our superior forces and swept away with machine guns. The × troops broke through and fled in disorder, and were intercepted by our ambushes on both sides of the road, leaving behind about 200 bodies. On the morning of the 13th, × continued to reinforce with 700 to 800 troops to counterattack. As of the afternoon, they were engaged in fierce battles near Heishanguan. In addition, more than 1,000 × troops in Mengxian recently invaded north in two routes. One part was defeated by us in Tonglu, and the other part occupied Xiashe.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West People's Magazine Discusses the Sino-Japanese War Situation　The Japanese People Are Tired of Continuing the Invasion of China　Uniting to Resist Aggression Makes Japan Helpless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] Shanghai News, the well-known Far East publication "Finance and Commerce Magazine" today published an article, saying that Japanese people are now gradually understanding that the invasion of China by the Japanese can only go so far and cannot advance any further. In any case, large-scale actions by the Japanese army may not happen again. A certain Japanese newspaper said that the Japanese government, military authorities, and the Japanese people all believe that continuing to attack the Chinese army is a waste of troops and not a good strategy. Therefore, people can know where the Chinese army will retreat to. According to this, this has now become a serious problem for Japan. Before the start of the war, the Japanese side would have dramatized it. The Japanese side now hopes that the future peace movement in China will gradually reduce the guerrillas, and intends to use the names of certain people to promote peace, but all Chinese people have already understood that this person has no power in the country, and this person has also refused to come out. The situation has gradually become clear, that is, the longer the war is delayed, the more advantageous it is for China. Japan will soon understand this point and think about how to deal with it. Whether Japan's achievements in the three northeastern provinces are beneficial to Situ is still doubtful. Even if it is said that Japan has achieved something in the Northeast, it is impossible to seek the same achievements in the mainland of China. Now the National Government of China still exists, and the unity of the Chinese people is becoming stronger and stronger, which has made the Japanese side helpless. Japanese government officials have said to the outside world that China is "not a modern country, and the word China is only a geographical term," etc. All these arguments have proven to be incorrect, and it is the Japanese policy that has made China united. Although China has been deceived by the Japanese army from the coast into the interior, and most of its tax revenue has also been lost as a result, its military strength and manpower are still superior to Japan. The Chinese people are deeply angered by Japan and will definitely strike them when they have the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Air Raid</h3>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 22nd] Fuzhou was bombed by × aircraft yesterday, the first time since the July 7th Incident. The × aircraft bombed twice. The Chinese side said that the losses were minimal and only one person was killed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Hami Line Regular Flights</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] The Eurasia Company's news Chongqing-Hami route will officially open on the 24th. The company has decided to send the "Lanzhou" large aircraft to take on the first flight on this route. The logo of the aircraft is the five characters for civil aviation aircraft painted on both the top and bottom of the wings, and the character for "post" on both sides of the fuselage. The entire fuselage is painted silver-gray, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Escapes Assassination　Zeng Zhongming Dies of Serious Injuries　Zeng's Wife and Several Others Are Seriously Injured　It Is Reported That the Assassin Was Arrested and Refused to Speak</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Shanghai, 22nd] According to a telegram from Hanoi, at about 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, several people assassinated Wang Jingwei and broke into Wang's residence and opened fire. At that time, Wang seemed not to be present, so only Zeng Zhongming and his wife were injured. Zeng was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday. (Note: Zeng Zhongming is 44 years old this year, from Minhou, Fujian. He studied literature in France and was Wang Jingwei's right-hand man. With Wang's power, he was appointed Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Railways, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, and Central Executive Committee Member. Wang defected and fled the country, and Zeng also went to Hanoi with him and was eventually shot and killed.)</p>
<p>[Associated Press Hanoi, 22nd] It is reported that the three Chinese who assassinated Wang Jingwei mistakenly thought Zeng Zhongming's residence was where Wang lived, while Wang actually lived next door. The assassins were all holding box cannons. Zeng and his wife were unable to escape and were both seriously injured. In addition, several others were injured. Zeng was shot four times in the abdomen and soon died.</p>
<p>[Hanoi, 22nd] According to Japanese Domei News Agency, the four murderers who assassinated Wang Jingwei on Monday morning have been arrested by the French police. However, despite extremely strict interrogation, they have refused to speak.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Kidnapping of Dodd, President of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, Is Revealed　Bandits Were Instructed by × to Extort 2 Million Yuan　British Consul-General Contacted × Twice Without Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 21st] Tianjin News, the truth about the kidnapping of Dodd, president of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, has been completely determined. It was indeed instructed by ×. Despite repeated efforts by the British authorities, they have not been able to find his whereabouts. The British Consul-General contacted × twice yesterday and today, but there were no results. The truth of this case is that when × publicly announced that legal tender was not allowed to be used, Dodd gave a speech at the Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting, criticizing ×'s measures from a commercial standpoint, which aroused ×'s dissatisfaction. The Honma Unit stationed in Tianjin intended to deal with Dodd, so they sent bandit leader Wu Changjie to handle the matter. Wu colluded with his followers to kidnap Dodd from his residence in Special District No. 1. Afterwards, they went to Tianjin Avenue and the car broke down. So they hired a car from Zuyi Car Company and drove towards Haiguangsi. When they arrived at Baitangkou, they were detained by the local puppet authorities and militia. The local puppet police officer thought that he had done a good job in handling this matter and immediately reported to Tianjin. The × advisor immediately notified the × authorities. Each team received the news and immediately sent troops by car to Baitangkou, together with Major Osnishi of the local × army, to detain Dodd. At the same time, × said that the British authorities had learned about Dodd's matter in Baitangkou. In addition to sending a team to rob him, they also ordered the puppet police and militia not to publicize that a kidnapped Westerner had passed by here, so that after the British sent people to rush over, they could not investigate the truth and rescue Dodd. As for the reason for the exposure of the inside story, it was because this matter was handled independently by the Honma Unit. Although the × military police were not aware of it beforehand, they thought it was a general kidnapping case, so they also cooperated with the British in investigating it. Now that the content has been revealed, it is expected that the Japanese side, having handled this matter, will certainly not let Dodd return. Moreover, the × side is now buying ruffians and bandits to plan to kidnap British and American political figures and powerful businessmen in Tianjin. It is extremely thorough. The British and American authorities have ordered expatriates living in Special District No. 1 to move to the concession, and have sent additional troops to protect them in the concession.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tianjin, 22nd] Since Dodd, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, was kidnapped in the former German Concession on the 17th, foreigners living in Japanese-controlled areas have also moved into the British and French concessions. Therefore, all the hostels are full. The Xintai Hing Company, where Dodd serves as general manager, received a letter this morning demanding 2 million yuan to purchase bonds.</p>
<h3>Shanghai × Illegally Enacts Traffic Regulations North of Suzhou Creek　Specifically Restricting Foreigners Driving Cars　Municipal Council Has Protested to × Consul</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Shanghai, 22nd] The Japanese Marine Corps here has established special traffic regulations in Hongkou. The Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese consulate, because legally, only the Municipal Council has the right to issue traffic regulations. The traffic regulations newly established by × are stricter than those issued by the Municipal Council, prohibiting car drivers from smoking while driving, increasing the number of "no parking" areas, and facilitating the passage of military vehicles.</p>
<p>[Shanghai Correspondent] The Shanghai × Special Marine Corps has illegally enacted traffic regulations north of Suzhou Creek, which officially took effect on the 15th. The regulations established by × are particularly inconvenient for foreigners driving cars, such as prohibiting drivers from smoking. Parking areas in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas have been strictly restricted, and the speed of cars has been restricted to no more than 30 kilometers per hour in the central area and no more than 40 kilometers per hour in the suburbs. This move seems to be aimed at recent assassination cases. It is reported that the Municipal Council immediately protested.</p>
<h3>The Entire Indian People Sympathize With Our Country's Resistance War　All Religions in India Unanimously Boycott × Goods　Shops Automatically Stop Purchasing</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Bishop Wood of the Chengdu Supervisory Church in Sichuan, recently accompanied by Reverend Mandu of the church in Momara, India, and Reverend Anjian of the church in Yangon, arrived in Hong Kong. The three of them went to Matterchens last year to participate in the International Missionary Conference. Wood was one of the representatives from China. He suggested that India and Myanmar should send representatives to China to promote friendship. According to Reverend Mandu, he has traveled to various parts of western China and participated in gatherings of various social groups, expressing that the 370 million people of India fully support China's war of resistance. His impressions of traveling in China are that China will fight to the end and will never admit defeat. The people participate in this sacred war, not avoiding hardships. If they can be consistent from beginning to end, Japan will eventually fail. All religions in India have now unanimously boycotted × goods, so shops in India have automatically stopped purchasing × goods. According to Reverend Anjian, people in Myanmar are quite ignorant of Chinese affairs, but those who know the methods adopted by × all express their deep sympathy for China. ×'s propaganda work in Myanmar is very active. Recently, they have also established scholarships for studying in Japan in Myanmar. He knows that what the Japanese are trying to do is nothing more than to achieve their continental policy and dominate Asia. Myanmar will become their route of advance. He will return to report on the situation of the purchases. It is heard that the two Indian pastors will stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to their country.</p>

He will fly approximately halfway to Hami, then change planes and pass through Hong Kong and Shanghai to inspect overseas Chinese. After a brief stay in Shanghai, he will return to Chongqing. Liang Zijun from our Military Affairs Commission, Zhang Pingqun from the Executive Yuan, and Duan Maolan from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs went to the airport to see him off.</p>
<p>Jamyang</p>
<p>(Lanzhou dispatch) A telegram received here from Changhe reports that Jamyang Hutuktu has been in Tibet for nearly two years, promoting resistance against Japan and praying for victory. On the 20th, all monks in Labrang Monastery held a meeting and decided to send representatives to Tibet on May 5th to welcome Jamyang back to Labrang.</p>
<h3>A True Record of What I Saw and Heard in Laohekou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>It has only been a few days since I left Xiangyang, but the city has almost completely changed. Enemy planes came again to bomb, with the targets seemingly being the towering city walls and the "Ming Zhao Wang Terrace." However, the bombing was inaccurate, and nearby civilian houses suffered the most. A small temple outside the West Gate was damaged by the bombing. Someone wrote in front of a stern-faced Buddha statue in the open air: "What kind of evil × slaves! How dare you commit such atrocities! May Heaven allow retribution, and may you deserve to die!" However, there is another heartening phenomenon related to the people's food supply: when I first arrived in Xiangyang, I saw citizens carrying bags and crowding to buy salt. But in no time, this salt shortage problem was readily solved. Xiangfan had a large reserve of salt, but due to manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and the failure of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office to prevent it beforehand or actively remedy it afterward, the unscrupulous merchants transported the salt stored in the city to the countryside to reap high prices. Fortunately, the Garrison Headquarters prohibited the transport of salt out of the city, and the Commander's Office sent a large number of wooden boats from the Shashi area to transport salt to Xiangyang, so that the citizens were not in danger of having bland food.</p>
<p>From Xiangfan, one can go northwest to Laohekou, and from Laohekou north via Nanyang to Luoyang, and west out of Jingziguan to Xijing. There are merchant vehicles available for transportation, which is relatively convenient. The transportation center of Henan Province has now shifted to the western part of Henan. Based on this, it can be predicted that if the Japanese do not succeed in Zhengzhou, they will definitely not dare to encroach on Xiangfan. But if the Japanese do not gain some strongholds in the Xiang River basin, they will not dare to take rash action against Zhengzhou. However, Xiangfan, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Luoyang, and Jingziguan are all mutually interconnected northwest national defense strongholds. All these fortified cities have already been building up strength. In the future, they will undoubtedly become a new Taierzhuang where the Japanese army will be annihilated en masse.</p>
<p>Laohekou is located at the strategic intersection of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. It is a transit port for the upper and lower reaches of the Han River, and also a distribution center for products from the border areas of the three provinces. Although it is in an extraordinary period, commerce is still very developed. Especially around eight or nine o'clock at night, the city is brightly lit, and people come and go like weaving shuttles. It is truly a prosperous city rarely seen in the interior; although this is a distorted result of daytime air raids.</p>
<p>Laohekou was originally a small town in Guanghua County, just like the relationship between Shashi and Jingzhou. Although administrative power is still in the hands of the county, the population, commerce, and economic center have all shifted to the convenient small town. Over time, the vassal has become a great power. Thus, Laohekou and Shashi have today's prosperous scene. At the same time, the police have also directly belonged to the provincial government.</p>
<p>On a street tour, I saw the station bringing in two prisoners from the front lines: one was a pitiful Shandong compatriot, driven to the front lines by the Japanese to be cannon fodder. His nerves were already deranged, and he only knew how to curse "Han Fuqu, the traitor." The other was a rather stubborn Japanese. He would kick the audience like a wild horse with his hooves. He would babble and roar, attracting the audience to surround him as if watching a monkey show. Later, someone tried to talk to him, but he only wrote a few squiggly characters, saying that he was a "Japanese Concession" person named "Meishenghan," "Adoptive parents - Wang Ming," and "Down with Japanese imperialism." When he wrote "Down with Japanese imperialism," according to the person who brought him, he always paid attention to the viewers when he passed places with powerful words. When someone asked him, he would write out a few incomplete lines. The implication is that he is speculating on China and is not sincerely enlightened—but that is not necessarily the case. When they got up, he kindly handed a piece of leftover pancake to a child, but the child didn't want it. A woman with bound feet hobbled over to see him. An acquaintance pointed to the newly bought bakelite bowl in her hand and joked: "This is the enemy goods they made!" She didn't even glance at the Japanese and turned around with shame, seemingly going to the seller to argue.</p>
<p>Going five or six li north out of the North Gate of Laohekou, one arrives at the county town of Guanghua. About four or five li west of Wangyao Road, among the willows and woods, are several tile-roofed houses, said to be the "Hometown of Zhou Wuzi Xu." There is still a stele beside the road as a memorial. This area is garrisoned by the heroic soldiers who fired the first shot at Lugou Bridge. They have a small rule that when taking rickshaws in and out of the city gates, they must get out of the rickshaw and walk; otherwise, the rickshaw pullers will be scolded by the guards. Some people find it troublesome and often protest. In fact, asking them to get out of the rickshaw is probably for easy inspection. It is not comparable to the Japanese forcing our compatriots in the occupied areas to take off their hats.</p>
<p>The streets in Tonghua Town are very straight, but the population is sparse, making one feel calm. Last winter, it was bombed twice by enemy planes, resulting in more than twenty casualties. Laohekou was also often bombed by enemy planes before, but since the international spy case involving an Italian missionary was cracked, although alarm bells have been frequently ringing, it has not suffered any more tragic bombings.</p>
<p>The cracking of this international spy case was a great effort on the part of the parties involved. According to my friend, Battalion Commander Zhou Dewei of the XX team, when the war broke out in Jiujiang, he foresaw that someone here was providing information to the Japanese via radio. Once, General Zhu De passed through here and stayed at a certain hotel for less than four hours. Enemy planes immediately bombed the hotel. Although it was determined that the Italian missionary in the Catholic Church was the spy, military police were inconvenient to enter the church to collect evidence due to extraterritorial rights.</p>
<p>Later, a certain Li, who was looked down upon as an idler, was motivated by patriotism and volunteered to help solve the case. He first got to know two workers in the church, slept with them, and got up in the middle of the night to offer sacrifices several times, but still did not find any trace of the radio. However, he found some clues in the workers' conversations.</p>
<p>The police bureau was eager to solve the case and arrested the two workers for interrogation. Not only did they fail to get any confessions, but they also risked causing a diplomatic dispute. Thereupon, Li offered a "bitter meat" ruse, asking to be arrested and interrogated along with the two workers on suspicion. They were detained and comforted each other. Li then learned that the Italian missionary was indeed an international spy who was secretly providing information to the Japanese via radio. The military police followed the clues and found the radio in a concealed location during an interrogation, thus clarifying the case.</p>
<p>Those two Italian spy missionaries were truly cunning. On one hand, they confessed and apologized to the military and civilians of Laohekou. On the other hand, they telegraphed our government, requesting leniency and asking that they not be deported, considering the many years of charitable work they had done in Laohekou. They have now moved from the church to Shengjia Keng and are under surveillance by our military police.</p>
<p>Such a lenient disposition is too cheap for them: because the charitable work they usually do is precisely used as a cover for their espionage work.</p>
<p>However, that Mr. Li, who was looked down upon by others, did not hesitate to endure physical hardship and assisted the police force, achieving great success in solving the case. This is indeed worthy of admiration and emulation, and it is necessary to eliminate spy traitor organizations everywhere!</p>

<h3>The Four Powers Will Issue a Declaration Against German Aggression - Principles Agreed Upon, Methods Under Discussion - The US Prepares to Express Its Attitude Separately</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Foreign affairs observers here write that the declaration of unity among the four powers against further German aggression, initiated by Britain, will be broadly worded. It is reported that the declaration will not specify any concrete constraints, nor will it make any definite provisions. The original draft of the declaration is currently under consideration by the governments of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland. However, no formal announcement is expected until tomorrow or Sunday. The Soviet Union and Poland hope that the declaration will specify the actions to be taken by the signatory countries, but British officials are eager to issue the declaration without including provisions for military action and international conferences for the time being. People here believe that it would be inconvenient to convene international conferences in this time of crisis. If a conference were held in Rome as suggested by the Soviet Union, discussions on various treaties and obligations would inevitably be time-consuming. People here emphasize that they are consulting with the Soviet Union regarding the drafting of the declaration, and there is no disagreement between them. In general, the principles are not in question. What is being discussed is the method. Everyone is paying close attention to Italy's attitude. Mussolini will deliver a speech next Sunday, at which time he will state Italy's position. The departure of the Italian ambassador to Germany from Berlin and his return to Italy has aroused commentary in diplomatic circles, like rumors of a Franco-Italian rapprochement (the Franco-Italian rapprochement has been denied). Today, the Polish and Turkish ambassadors to Britain visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax. French Foreign Minister Bonnet has accompanied the French President to Britain. He will meet with the British Foreign Secretary tomorrow to discuss the specific details of the unity declaration. Romanian Ambassador to Britain Tilea visited the Foreign Office today and is scheduled to return to Romania tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] British Ambassador to Poland Kennard visited the Polish Foreign Office today. It is widely believed that he has notified Colonel Beck of the British proposed diplomatic plan and sought his opinion. People here believe that Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, has long pursued a policy of not joining any group, and does not want to change it or be bound by any constraints. Beck will go to London on April 3, at which time there will be a thorough discussion of Poland's attitude. Currently, Beck is unlikely to participate in the British plan. People here point out that Poland has a treaty of alliance with France and also has a treaty with Romania.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Roosevelt announced at a meeting with reporters today that he was quite displeased with the current situation, but declined to criticize developments in Central Europe. He said that reports that he had suggested a unified economic sanctions against Germany were unfounded.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] It is rumored that relevant parties here will send several unofficial envoys to Italy to undertake special missions. It is said that the candidate is former Prime Minister Laval, who previously represented the French side in negotiations with Mussolini on North African trade agreement issues. However, Laval has categorically denied this. It is widely believed that if there is such a decision on the part of the National Relations Committee, it must be implemented immediately, as Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow this week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] The Italian ambassador to Germany has returned to Rome to report on the international situation to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.

<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Italian Ambassador Attolico visited Hitler yesterday and met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Air Force Minister General Goering. He returned to his post today. General Goering is also continuing his vacation in San Remo, Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] The official TASS news agency has formally denied that the Soviet government had promised Poland and Romania to provide assistance if the two countries were invaded by other countries. It also said that the two countries had not requested assistance or notified the Soviet government of any threatened danger. On March 18, the British government notified the Soviet side, pointing out that Romania was likely to be subjected to violence at any time, and inquired about what attitude the Soviet Union would take if such a situation occurred. When responding, the Soviet side proposed convening a conference of countries with close interests, namely, Britain, France, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. However, the British side believed that this suggestion was not yet ripe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese newspapers say that in view of the development of the situation in Europe, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will have to change their Far Eastern policy. "Miyako Shimbun" claims that Japan must pay serious attention to the development of the situation in the future, because the anti-German axis of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been strengthened, and Europe is already in serious danger.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Melbourne, 22nd] Australian Prime Minister Lyons announced yesterday that the Australian Cabinet had decided in a special meeting to fully assist the British government, maintain world peace, and protect the freedom and independence of invaded countries.</p>

<h3>Lithuania also Succumbs Under Military Threat - Memel Region of Lithuania Ceded to Germany - Hitler Will Travel With the Army</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lithuanian Capital, 22nd] The Lithuanian government has now agreed in principle to Germany's unconditional demand that the Memel territory be incorporated into Germany. The Lithuanian parliament will meet today to ratify this decision. It is understood that Germany's demand is subject to a 48-hour time limit.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] According to unofficial reports, the Lithuanian government has decided to accept Germany's demands and immediately return Memel to Germany. Today, Lithuanians and Jews in Memel are fleeing en masse.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Memel territory was handed over to Germany last night. People here were shocked when they heard the news this morning. The official will not issue a statement to foreign countries. A government spokesman told a Reuters reporter: "Germany has supreme power in Memel, which no one can deny." It is understood that Hitler will probably accompany the German army into Memel, and the navy will also participate in the celebration. Political figures believe that Hitler will take this opportunity to deliver an important speech to respond to foreign criticism. A German newspaper said: "The democratic countries have tasted a serious lesson again."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 22nd] The Germans in Memel are now celebrating their return to Germany. Stormtroopers are parading and demonstrating, and women are dancing and singing on the streets. At the same time, Lithuanians are extremely saddened by the abandonment of Memel. This morning, after the Germans took over the post office, telegraph office, and government agencies, the last link between Memel and Lithuania was broken. A large number of Germans are crossing the border into Memel. An official from the Berlin Propaganda Department declared that German troops had not yet entered Memel and would only be sent to occupy it after the Lithuanian envoy arrived in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 21st] Lithuanian Governor of Memel, Gris, confirmed today that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Lithuania demanding the cession of the Memel territory to Germany. Lithuania is currently considering a reply and is expected to reply on Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 22nd] After confirming that Germany had demanded the cession of Memel to Lithuania, Lithuanian Governor of Memel Gris said that Germany had also told Lithuania that if Lithuania caused disturbances, German troops would enter to maintain order.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] A report from Comas says that Germany has sent a note to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister demanding that Memel be ceded within five days. It is said that if Lithuania does not comply with the demands in the note, the German troops concentrated along the border will immediately enter Lithuania. However, if it complies with its demands, Lithuania can be given border protection and the right to use the port.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memel, 21st] Memel Nationalist Party leader Neumann told a Reuters interviewer today that he hoped that Lithuania would "cede the Memel territory as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Today, newspapers here expressed shock at Hitler's actions in Lithuania. "The Globe" said, "Germany's occupation of Memel is sufficient to prove that without the establishment of a strong gathering of peaceful countries, there can be no resistance. Germany does not hesitate to attack small and weak countries, but the situation changes in an instant, and we must pay attention to not missing the opportunity."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Comas, 22nd] A communiqué issued here said that "Germany has promised Lithuania's economic interests in the port of Memel. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has specifically pointed out to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister that, according to news from Memel, this issue should be resolved quickly in accordance with Germany's suggestions to avoid conflict." It is heard that the German government has agreed to maintain friendly treaty relations with Lithuania.</p>
<h3>New Neutrality Act - US House of Representatives May Pass It</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] A Reuters Congressional correspondent learned that the attitude of the House of Representatives on the amendment to the Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will depend on the actions of the Senate. If it is passed by the Senate, the House of Representatives will also pass it. Pro-government figures believe that although Senators Borah, Nye, etc., are firmly opposed, a majority can still be passed, and the deliberate picking of minor points by a small number of people in public opinion is not a cause for concern.</p>

<p>[Haitong Agency, Washington, 22nd] U.S. Secretary of State Welles sent a note to the German Embassy in the U.S. today in reply to the German declaration of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The reply stated that the government has learned that the two regions of Bohemia and Moravia are in fact under German rule, and cannot legally recognize this situation.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons - Pays Attention to German Occupation of Czechoslovakia - Increases Superior Armaments</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Undersecretary of State Butler replied in the House of Commons today, "To my knowledge, Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia has not resulted in any loss in terms of military strength." A member of parliament asked, "Is it true that Germany now has newly added first-class superior reserves, including 700 excellent aircraft, and there is a new Skoda armory that can continuously supply military supplies?" The Undersecretary replied, "This is difficult to answer." Sir Cooper Howard said, "The caliber of Czech heavy artillery and rifles is different from that of Germany. The benefits Germany obtains from acquiring these guns are not as great as people think."</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Paris, 22nd] Yesterday, "Paris Soir" claimed that the French government, following the example of the British and American governments, ordered banks to stop paying out deposits of Czech expatriates. Financial circles believe that this step will have a great impact on Czechs residing in France who attempt to switch to German nationality.</p>
<h3>Slovakian Cabinet Members Visit Germany - Agreement Expected - Difficulties Reported</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Two Slovakian cabinet members arrived here yesterday and held talks with the German authorities.

Germany also plans to issue a declaration on the 21st or 22nd of this month, stipulating the relationship between the country and Slovakia. Because the negotiations have been protracted, there are widespread rumors that difficulties have arisen between the two sides.</p>
<h3>Six Thousand Pounds - British Government Subsidizes Reuters - Labor Party Members Launch Debate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] During today's parliamentary debate, the issue of the government granting six thousand pounds to Reuters last year during the European crisis was raised. This money was used to increase Reuters' delivery of news to foreign countries at that time. Labor MP Philip said, "I do not want to attack Reuters' commercial principles and integrity. I have no bias in my suggestions about Reuters. However, I want to know if the parliament approved six thousand pounds for Reuters to send more news, whether it was about speeches and criticisms favorable to the government or criticisms of the government's foreign policy. Whether the newspapers of the dominions have disclosed this news. Communication agencies in South America and the United States do not trust Reuters because Reuters is subsidized by the government." Another Labor MP Baker said, "Considering Reuters' annual expenses, six thousand pounds is a small amount, but it may be unfavorable abroad because Reuters will be considered to be under the influence of the government." Undersecretary of State Butler said, "The British government's assistance to Reuters is purely a special emergency measure, the purpose of which is to publish more British news."</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Terrifying "Increase" and "Development"</h3>
<p>"Increase" and "development" are usually good terms, but today's local news contains frightening news about "increase" and "development":</p>
<p>The first piece of news is about the increase in Japanese goods imports. The statistics for last month show a large increase compared to the same month last year. When we think about it, more than nine-tenths of Hong Kong residents are Chinese. Isn't this news of increased Japanese goods imports a ruthless and terrible insult to us? Although this insult doesn't affect the vast majority of overseas Chinese and is the responsibility of a few unscrupulous merchants, shouldn't we look at the fervent movements to boycott Japanese goods in Britain, the United States, and India?</p>
<p>The second piece of news is the sudden development of Hong Kong's entertainment industry during the war of resistance. Of course, the biggest contributors to this development are our wealthy and pleasure-seeking upper-class refugees! However, being a contributor to Hong Kong's entertainment industry inevitably means being an unfilial descendant of the Chinese motherland! We don't hope that everyone will give up entertainment, but to promote the entertainment industry during the war of resistance cannot be considered anything other than terrible news. May those who have the money to enjoy entertainment also think about the motherland under fire and the suffering compatriots!</p>
<h3>Respectable 370 Million</h3>
<p>Indian pastor Montulu recently arrived in Hong Kong and stated that 370 million Indian people are willing to be the support behind the Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan. He also said that all religions in India are united in boycotting Japanese goods, and shops are voluntarily stopping their procurement.</p>
<p>China's resistance is not only seeking its own national independence, freedom, and happiness but also resisting the common aggressor to defend world peace and justice. The interests of the Indian people are completely aligned with ours. The two great ancient civilizations of China and India should hold hands closely today to jointly resist these vermin of human civilization. Under the leadership of their wise and progressive leader, Mr. Nehru, the Indian people are faithfully implementing a united national front, fighting for liberation by opposing fascism and aggression. We should offer the highest national respect to the brave leaders and 370 million comrades-in-arms of India and wish the two great civilized and advanced nations a future of great victory.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Dies for the Cause of ×</h3>
<p>An Associated Press report states that several patriots unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Wang Jingwei in Hanoi, and Wang's personal secretary, Zeng Zhongming, was wounded and died on the 21st. Zeng loyally followed Wang Jingwei for many years... Zeng also privately abandoned his important central post to follow Wang. Now he has died for Wang, which can be truly called "dying for the cause of ×." Now some people say that Zeng "died for the country," as if Zeng's death occurred while serving the country, to cover up the fact that he privately abandoned his post to follow a traitor. What is the intention behind this? How can it be heard?</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Singapore Certainly Engaged in Espionage; Britain Has Responded to Japanese Protest; Searches Conducted According to Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] The Japanese government previously protested to the British government on January 28th regarding the search of Japanese residents' homes and the arrest of several Japanese residents suspected of espionage by the British authorities in Singapore. The British side has now responded, stating that the search conducted by the British authorities in Singapore was carried out in accordance with the law and that the police investigation has proven that some Japanese residents in Singapore are engaged in activities harmful to Singapore. The defensive measures taken by the British authorities in Singapore are exactly the same in meaning as the defensive measures taken by the Japanese government in the Sixth Garrison District. The position of Singapore is similar to the position of Japan. Several instances have been found of Japanese residents engaging in espionage work. The British government hopes that Japanese residents in Singapore will abide by their obligations as residents so that the British authorities will not need to take further measures.</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Construction of Western Defenses; Rumors of Inciting Hungary to Invade Romania; Preparations Completed Near Romanian Capital</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Metz, France, 21st] According to sources here, Germany is intensifying the strengthening of its western border defenses. Workers are rushing to build fortifications day and night under the direction of engineers, many of whom arrived on Saturday night. Tank traps are being built half a mile from the French border. It is said that once these tank "graves" are completed, the Germans will immediately build military huts to camouflage them. German guards, armed to the teeth, are on strict alert.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 22nd] Although Hungary has not officially announced mobilization, officials do not deny that several thousand people have already been ordered to enlist. What is seen here indicates that military steps will continue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 22nd] According to the London "Times" correspondent in Budapest this morning, it is confirmed that Hungarian troops are indeed mobilizing. The exact number is difficult to ascertain, but it is believed to be very large. This mobilization is entirely directed against Romania. Although the Hungarian envoy in Paris denied this yesterday, the Hungarian government issued an official gazette in Budapest confirming that it had ordered partial mobilization. The official gazette stated that because Romania was concentrating heavy troops on the Hungarian border, the Hungarian government had no choice but to take this measure as a routine response to the threat. Troops from both countries are currently facing each other on the border, but there are no signs of a serious escalation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st] People in political circles here are quite uneasy about Germany's attitude after Hungary occupied Ruthenia. It is said that Germany may incite Hungary to attack Romania to recover Transylvania Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st] The State Council recently issued a public announcement stating that military measures have been taken in the vicinity of Bucharest. The investigation of residents who have military service obligations has been completed to allow them to be called up when necessary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 21st] An official announcement here today stated that the Romanian government, in accordance with a cabinet decision, has concentrated several divisions of reserves. If necessary, they will be sent to the border to reinforce defenses. If Romania adopts a peaceful policy, these reserves will not go to the border but will be trained. Once the neighboring countries demobilize, these reserves will be dismissed. It also said that large armies have not been concentrated on the border. The existing troops are only engaged in exercises.</p>
<h3>Our Currency System is Stable; British Parliamentarians Unanimously Support Aid to China; Japan's Plans Will Inevitably Fail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Yesterday in the Lower House, Finance Minister Simon proposed a second reading of the bill to increase the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund, stating that although British trade with China accounts for only a small percentage of Britain's total foreign trade, it still has the value of being maintained and further assisted. Furthermore, China has a large population, and even a slight increase in the purchasing power of each individual would make a significant difference. The outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict was an extremely serious test for the currency system adopted in 1935. The various technical methods adopted by China are extremely complete. At the same time, overseas Chinese citizens are also actively remitting huge sums back to their motherland or enthusiastically purchasing various wartime bonds to consolidate their domestic currency system. In the past year, China's currency system has been complete and orderly, without any disturbance, and its credit has remained unshakable. If the Lower House can support the government's proposed bill, then I solemnly guarantee to you that the Chinese people will be able to maintain their past high praise. Labor Party member Lawrence rose to speak, saying that this bill can promote British trade, and what is particularly noteworthy is that this bill can provide China with practical assistance to resist Japan. Therefore, this seat expresses extreme support for the government's bill. Liberal Party member Mond also supported the government's bill, saying that until today, the government should consider what other actions to take to enhance China's position and stop Japanese aggression. The government's handling of this matter in the past, with a narrow perspective, is truly regrettable. We must make more efforts to allow British goods to be freely exported to any corner of the world. The government's introduction of this bill is indeed one of the implementation of various resolutions of the League of Nations. Conservative Party member Boothby said that perhaps this way of assisting China is too late, and the amount is not sufficient. This is the only thing I regret. Labor Party member Smith proposed a counter-proposal, saying that if the government does not adopt a new political and economic policy towards the Far East, it will be impossible to stop the instability of British trade. In the past, the government, in order not to offend Japan, failed to take the lead from a humanitarian standpoint to assist China. For eight years, the government has always adhered to its consistent policy, namely, sacrificing the invaded country in order to negotiate with the aggressor. Labor Party member Tinker supported Smith's counter-proposal, declaring that what the government is now proposing is the result of our failure to firmly stand our ground when Japan invaded China in the past. Parliamentarian Astor said, I hope that the original proposer of the amendment does not need to be so aggressive in his claims. If the Lower House can pass this bill, then China, both in government and in the private sector, will definitely feel satisfied. Therefore, the Lower House should unanimously pass the bill. Labor Party member Burke (Lancashire parliamentarian) said that if the government can find a way to maintain the British cotton trade market, the cotton merchants in this county will be extremely grateful. Regardless of how long the current war extends, Britain's real competition will begin after the end of the war. If the original proposer of the amendment insists on his claim, then I will vote in favor of the government's bill. Labor Party member Brenger said that if the purpose of this bill is to promote Sino-British trade relations, then this seat will express support. The purpose of this bill should be guaranteed by Finance Minister Simon. As for whether or not to imitate the precedent of the Triple Entente and cooperate fully with the United States and France when implementing this bill, Simon replied that other governments have financially assisted China in various ways in the past. For example, the United States has purchased large quantities of silver. As for this bill, I would like to ask the Lower House to regard it as a form of British assistance to China. The Finance Department representative Wallace replied on behalf of the government, saying that all parliamentarians from the opposition party admit that the amount of ten million pounds is sufficient to achieve the purpose of this bill. At the same time, during the debate in the Lower House, all parties also admitted that China's currency system is currently not showing any signs of wavering and has indeed been able to maintain its stability in the past. Domestic support for it in China is consistent, and the situation is extremely good. As for the reason for designating four Chinese banks to participate in the management of this fund, it is because each bank has particularly rich experience in this matter, and their locations are suitable in various places related to this case. Therefore, entrusting the responsibility of managing this huge sum to the four banks will definitely be successful and pleasant. As for what actions the government should have taken in the past to assist China, or what actions it should take, in short, this bill will definitely be of great help to China. This is undoubtedly the case. Therefore, the government sincerely hopes that the Lower House can unanimously express support, because the passage of this bill will definitely have a huge psychological impact on China. Regarding the Japanese side's currency system plan in North China and the British side's protest about this, Wallace said that according to expert commentary, many believe that the overall result of this Japanese plan will inevitably fail. This is what we can be greatly pleased about. If the Japanese side attempts to change the exchange rate of one Japanese yen for eight and a half pence to one yen for fourteen pence, then the impact will be that all export trade will inevitably stop immediately. Therefore, based on the current situation, China's legal tender will generally continue to circulate in all places, except for large cities and places along railways under Japanese military control. Wallace continued that Hong Kong has been designated as the place for the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund to be used. The fund of ten million pounds will be shared immediately by the Chinese and British banks according to their shares. The current fund of ten million pounds will be held in Britain before it is used. The interest earned can be used by the Chinese bank to repay the British bank. The interest rate of the fund is temporarily set at 2.75%. If the two parties renew the agreement after one year, the interest can be appropriately increased or decreased. The reason why the bill does not specify the maximum interest rate is to ensure the possibility that the Sino-British agreement may continue to be in effect for several years. The government does not want to repeatedly submit a request to the Lower House for approval.</p>

The import value last month was 1,549,368 Hong Kong dollars, while in the same month last year, it was 1,423,677 Hong Kong dollars. The export value was 297,969 Hong Kong dollars, while in the same month last year, it was 474,092 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Merchants Seek Profit; ×××××</p>
<p>Furthermore, the local weaving industry is flourishing, with products such as singlets, socks, and vests selling well in Southeast Asia, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Borneo. Overseas orders are increasing daily, and many newly established electric weaving factories have been established, numbering no less than two hundred. All have obtained substantial profits, and the number of people engaged in this work exceeds ten thousand. Among them, women are particularly numerous, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total number of workers. An investigation reveals that the weaving industry in Hong Kong uses three types of yarn: one is Shanghai's domestic yarn (this type of yarn is produced by Shanghai's Wing On Company. Since Shanghai fell, Hong Kong manufacturers have no longer been able to use it), the second is British Indian (Bombay) yarn, and the third is ×-produced × yarn. The latter two are commonly used by Hong Kong weaving manufacturers today. In the past two years, the Hong Kong Weaving Industry Association ××××××××, has convened numerous meetings to discuss and all agreed to use British Indian (Bombay) yarn as the raw material, and established regulations to encourage each other. At that time, there were also special tax benefits for products made with Bombay yarn. Since the implementation of the regulations, many Hong Kong weaving manufacturers have been happy to comply, resulting in purely British yarn-made products. Unexpectedly, less than two years later, some merchants, taking advantage of the overseas and local Chinese compatriots' patriotic fervor, using local cloth, have been falsely claiming their products as Hong Kong products...</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Shipments to Hong Kong Reached 6 Million Annually</p>
<p>According to unofficial statistics, last year's shipments of × yarn to Hong Kong reached approximately 6 million Hong Kong dollars. The formal weaving of products with Bombay yarn accounted for less than one-third. Later, the investigators discovered ××××××, therefore, the export situation of domestic products this spring has plummeted. The order count is only within one million Hong Kong dollars. According to officials from the industry association, the reason why × yarn can be massively sold in Hong Kong, despite the specially preferential and guaranteed Bombay yarn, still cannot compete with it, is because firstly, the yarn quality is not as smooth and fine as × yarn, and secondly, the cost is higher. It is hoped that the Hong Kong tax authorities and the Imports and Exports Department will give this matter careful consideration so that Bombay yarn can regain its market. It is also hoped that Hong Kong weaving manufacturers can be willing to purchase and use friendly raw materials.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Shanghai, the escort business in Hong Kong has been exceptionally prosperous. The establishment of escort agencies has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Because the escorts in each agency are mixed and uneven in quality, and because some degenerates use the name of escort to engage in prostitution, the traces have been revealed and the facts have become clear.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Government is Considering the Issue of the Existence and Abolition of Escort Agencies</h3>
<p>In the Future, Those Who Engage in Prostitution Under the Guise of Escorts Will Be Resolutely Cracking Down</p>
<p>Social morals have been greatly affected, and people from all walks of life have been criticizing this. Gradually, it has aroused the attention of the Hong Kong government authorities. Recently, all the escort agencies in Hong Kong held a meeting to form an association to try to purify themselves and survive. It was resolved to submit a case to the government, requesting approval for establishment. At present, people from all walks of life in society are paying attention to the issue of the survival of escort agencies. The reporter once asked Mr. Cally, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, about this matter. According to him, the escort agency submitted an application to this department for registration, but the government has not yet made any decision on this matter, and this department has not expressed any opinion on the current situation of escort agencies. According to what the reporter knows, the Hong Kong government is indeed paying close attention to the increasing number of escort agencies being established. The government has also received reports from various parties regarding the escort agencies' transgressions. It is currently considering cracking down on them. According to general speculation, even if the government does not completely abolish the escort agencies in the future, it will definitely formulate strict regulations to make the escort agencies abide by them in order to maintain social morals and order.</p>

<h3>The Verdict on the Shooting of Lin Baisheng: Chen Xilin Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison; Witnesses Testified that Chen Was the Assailant, Lin Also Testified in Court; Chen Vigorously Denied Guilt, Resulting in Conviction for Assault</h3>
<p>Lin Baisheng, the manager of the Hong Kong South China Daily, who published a pro-peace telegram on behalf of Wang Jingwei, was suddenly attacked at around 5 p.m. on the 17th of January this year in front of the McIntosh Company on Des Voeux Road, sustaining multiple head injuries. Afterwards, the suspect, Chen Xilin, was apprehended by British military medics. The police immediately collected evidence and charged him with (1) assaulting Lin Baisheng in Des Voeux Road on January 17, with intent to murder, and (2) assaulting Lin Baisheng with intent to inflict bodily harm, totaling two counts. The injured party, Lin Baisheng, suffered relatively minor injuries and, after being sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment, was not in serious condition. During the central trial, Lin had already taken the stand to testify. After the magistrate, Mr. Edwards, recorded his testimony, the case was transferred to the High Court for sentencing. Details were reported previously. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Justice McKillop convened a jury of seven members: E. Zhen Gao (foreman), Bai Li Jia Shi, Cai Hu Zhong, Chen Liu Chou, Huang Ning Guang, and A. Lie Bao Lu Fu, for deliberation. Government barristers Bao Lian Di Shi and Shao Liao Ya Li Ma Da prosecuted, and the defendant did not retain a lawyer. The plaintiff, Lin Baisheng, retained lawyer Shi Lu Hua to observe the proceedings. Lin Baisheng wore a blue cotton robe, carried a walking stick, and appeared in good spirits, but his right eye had not yet healed and was covered with an eye patch. The defendant, Chen Xilin, wore the same brownish-yellow flight shirt and gray cloth trousers as he had in the preliminary court.</p>
<p>The Prosecuting Attorney Outlines the Case</p>
<p>After the trial began, barrister Shao Liao Ya Li Ma Da outlined the case, stating that on the afternoon of January 17 this year, at around 5 p.m., Lin Baisheng, manager of the South China Daily, walked down from the Zhongtian Building and proceeded west along the sidewalk. Upon reaching the McIntosh Company, he turned onto the main road. Lin had forgotten whether he was on the sidewalk or the side of the road, but after only a few steps, he suddenly felt several blows to his head and immediately fell to the ground unconscious. Fortunately, Lin was wearing a felt hat, which absorbed much of the impact. At this time, Dr. Hua happened to be walking out of Lane Crawford, heading towards his car, when he suddenly heard a commotion in the street. He saw a Chinese man running west and another man standing next to Lin, striking him three times in the back of the head with an iron cone before discarding the weapon and fleeing. At the same time, a Westerner named Luo Bian Shen rushed forward to give chase. The man ran across the tram tracks, between the Gloucester Hotel and Lane Crawford, where Luo Bian Shen finally caught up with him. A military medic, Xia Shi, heard the commotion and rushed to intercept him, bringing him back to the scene of the incident for police investigation. Dr. Hua, amidst the confusion, returned to Lane Crawford and called the police station and ambulance. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Hua returned to the scene and saw the plaintiff lying in a pool of blood. An iron hammer was found about three feet away from him, and an iron bar was found a foot away from the tram tracks. British Constable He Jin Shi arrived after hearing the report, and Xia Shi identified the man as the one who had struck the plaintiff with a hammer. The ambulance then arrived and took the injured party to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, police detectives handed over the recovered iron bar and iron strip to Constable Yun Di for filing. At this time, the police still did not know the name of the injured party and only learned it later. When the defendant was charged, his statement was merely, "I have nothing to say." The plaintiff's right eye is still affected and requires ongoing treatment.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Recounts the Attack</p>
<p>After Luo Fu Shi testified about his experience photographing the scene, Dr. Ge Ni from Queen Mary Hospital took the stand. He testified that Lin Baisheng was admitted to the hospital at about 6 p.m. on January 17 this year and was treated by him. He saw a one-and-a-half-inch-long wound on his right eyebrow, extending downward, and the eyelid was bruised and black. An X-ray revealed that his eye socket was fractured, and there were also wounds on his forehead and three semi-circular wounds on the back of his head. Lin was slightly conscious when admitted to the hospital and remained hospitalized until February 16, when he was discharged. However, his right eye has not yet healed. The injured party sustained a total of eight head injuries. His brain was not injured because the felt hat presented in court provided considerable protection. Then, the plaintiff Lin Baisheng took the stand, stating that he was the founder and manager of the South China Daily at 49 Hollywood Road. On the afternoon of January 17 this year, at 5 p.m., he walked down from the Zhongtian Building to return to the South China Daily. As he stepped out of the arcade, he suddenly felt someone attacking him from the side and behind. After taking two steps, he collapsed to the ground. He did not know what happened afterwards but faintly heard a Western woman shouting "ambulance." The felt hat presented in court was the one he was wearing on the day of the incident. It had just been dry-cleaned and was in excellent condition. His right eye is now different, and he did not previously know the attacker.</p>
<p>Dr. Hua Testifies that Chen Was the Assailant</p>
<p>Following this, Dr. Hua took the stand, stating that he was a doctor at Queen Mary Hospital. On the afternoon of January 17, he left Lane Crawford and was about to get into his car when he heard a commotion. He looked up and saw the defendant striking a Chinese man who had fallen to the ground three times on the head with an iron hammer. The defendant then discarded the hammer and fled. He immediately returned to Lane Crawford and informed the police station by telephone. Then, witness Luo Bian Shen took the stand, stating that on that day he was passing in front of the Gloucester Building when he suddenly saw a Chinese man fall to the ground. Another Chinese man (the defendant) was holding an iron hammer high above his shoulder, striking him three times on the head. He shouted, "Stop that man!" and ran after the defendant. Another person then intercepted the defendant and brought him back to the scene. Another person then picked up an iron hammer and an iron bar and placed them beside the injured party. There were no pedestrians or vehicles passing on the road that day. He positively identified the defendant as the one who committed the assault, as he had never taken his eyes off the defendant that day. After his testimony, British military medic Xia Shi, who apprehended the defendant that day, testified that at about 5 p.m. on that afternoon, he and a companion were walking west on Des Voeux Road near Lane Crawford when they suddenly heard a shout of "Stop that man." He turned around and saw a Chinese man lying on the road opposite them, and another man running west. He soon lost sight of him, but then saw another man running towards him from the location where the man was lying on the ground. He and his companion intercepted him. This man was the defendant present in court. Luo Bian Shen then arrived and, together, they brought him to the scene of the incident. Someone else handed an iron hammer to him, and he handed it over to Constable He Jin Shi. At this point, the judge asked the defendant if he needed Xia Shi's companions, William and John, to testify. The defendant said no. The judge then continued with the testimony of Constable He Jin Shi, who stated that he was at Watson's pharmacy on the third floor when he received a report and rushed to the scene. He saw a Chinese man lying on the road, with several people attending to him. He then took the defendant and witnesses back to the police station and handed them over to Constable Wen Shi for investigation. The injured party was sent to the hospital by ambulance.</p>
<p>The Defendant Denies the Assault</p>
<p>Then, Constable Wen Shi testified, stating that at about 5 p.m. that afternoon, he was in the detective department when Constable He Jin Shi handed over the defendant and the witnesses to him. He asked who the injured party was, and everyone said they did not know. The defendant then told him that the injured party was Lin Baisheng. Then, police interpreter Tan Bo Xi testified about explaining the charges to the defendant and filing the case. Then, the defendant testified in the defendant's box, stating that he had five people, Lin Jiu, Mai Ming, Bo Bing, Chen Hou, and Mai Cong, who could prove his innocence, but only Lin Jiu was present in court. The witnesses for the plaintiff said that he was the one who attacked the plaintiff, but he denied it. At 4:50 p.m. that afternoon, he finished his work at the Murray Barracks and walked out, passing by the Zhongtian Building. He saw a crowd of people watching something and, thinking there was an accident, he went over to watch as well. He saw the injured party lying on the ground. Not knowing what was going on, he continued forward. Because there were so many people watching that day, the road was blocked, so he crossed diagonally to the opposite sidewalk. Suddenly, someone arrested him, and then a Westerner brought him to the injured party. At that time, many people were watching him, but he really did not know who the injured party was. Then, the defendant's witness Lin Jiu took the stand, stating that he lived on the third floor of 39 Shandong Street and worked as a painter. On the day of the incident, he and the injured party worked together at the Murray Barracks. He finished work at 5 p.m. that afternoon and returned home. He did not know what happened afterwards. At this point, the evidence had been recorded. The judge discussed the case with the jurors. The jurors retired to deliberate and then returned to the court and announced, by a vote of six to one, that the defendant's first charge of attempted murder should be dropped due to insufficient evidence. The second charge of causing bodily harm was upheld. The judge then addressed the defendant, saying that, fortunately, the injured party had a felt hat to protect his head; otherwise, the injuries would have been much more serious and your crime would have been much greater. Now, the jurors unanimously find you guilty. The defendant was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. Finally, Justice McKillop announced that the remaining criminal cases for this month would be postponed until next Monday.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery by Four Thieves in Ho Sheung Heung, Lok Ma Chau; Mr. and Mrs. Hou Robbed of Over One Hundred Dollars in Valuables; Village Guards Heard the Alarm and Pursued the Thieves, But They Had Already Fled</h3>
<p>House number 17 in Ho Sheung Heung Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, is where resident Hou Yi (48 years old) and his family live. House number 18 is where his son, Mr. Hou, and his wife, Liao Ying (23 years old), live. At 12:30 a.m. yesterday morning, Hou Yi was awakened from his sleep by the sound of prying at the door. He saw four bandits break in. The leader was about twenty years old, wearing a black cloth shirt and pants, and holding a revolver. The three bandits following behind were also about twenty years old, wearing black shirts and pants, but none of them had weapons. Only one bandit was holding a flashlight. All four bandits spoke with a Shenzhen accent and appeared extremely fierce. After entering the house, the one with the gun immediately threatened Hou Yi and his family with the gun. Seeing that the bandits had a gun, and fearing harm, everyone dared not resist. The bandits then tied up everyone and gagged them, confining them to a corner. Then, they split up to rummage through boxes and chests, searching for about half an hour. Three bandits then left the house and went to the house of Hou's daughter-in-law, Liao Ying, next door, while one bandit remained to watch over Hou Yi and the others. The three bandits also broke down the door and entered, first subduing the people in the house and tying them up, then searching for about half an hour. After successfully robbing the house, the three bandits went to the house of farmer Zeng San (60 years old) at number 16 next door. However, for some unknown reason, they immediately came out of the house, so Zeng's family was spared from being robbed. The one bandit returned to Hou Yi's house, and together with the bandit guarding the house, they fled back to Shenzhen in the Chinese territory. It is suspected that the four bandits came from Shenzhen. After the bandits left, the people in Hou's two houses managed to untie themselves after a long time. They blew a whistle to alert the authorities and inspected their losses. Hou's two families were robbed of HK$145 (including five HK$10 bills, eighteen HK$5 bills, and HK$5 in small change), three dollars and six dimes in Cantonese currency, a steel dart worth three dollars, a black velvet coat worth two dollars, a silver ring worth two dollars, a pearl hair ornament worth twenty dollars, a gold hair clip worth two dollars, and a flashlight worth five dimes, totaling HK$182.50. Soon, villagers heard the alarm whistle and came out to investigate. After learning of the robbery, they armed themselves and gave chase, but it was too late, and the bandits had already fled. They had no choice but to report the case to the Lok Ma Chau Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station immediately telegraphed all district police stations to file the case and search for the bandits.</p>
<h3>The Salvation Army Will Expand Shelters to Rescue Child Prostitutes; Current Capacity is Only Thirteen; Authorities Sympathetic and Considering Assistance in Building Shelters</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army held its annual meeting at the Kowloon Headquarters last Tuesday. Attendees included Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote and his wife, Mr. Proler (Chairman), and Commissioner Burton of the Salvation Army, totaling over one hundred people. After the meeting began as scheduled, Mr. Burton first reported on the work of the past year. He also mentioned the issue of prostitution in Hong Kong, stating that due to the recent global economic recession, women are often forced by circumstances to engage in prostitution. Even underage girls have been found. This is truly a negative aspect of Hong Kong. The current priority is to expand shelters to accommodate girls who have escaped from prostitution, so that they do not wander aimlessly and fall back into the mire. They should be treated for their hidden illnesses and find ways to become self-reliant, so that their minds and bodies can find a home and regain their vitality. The Salvation Army will strive to resolve this issue. However, due to the limited space and inadequate equipment of the existing shelters, and the large number of those seeking refuge, they find it difficult to cope. Moreover, the original shelters accommodate juvenile offenders or homeless girls, many of whom do not know what prostitution is. It is impossible to mix them together. Therefore, they sincerely hope that all parties will vigorously assist in this meaningful cause to eliminate this stain on Hong Kong. Then, Chairman Proler stated that building shelters to accommodate liberated child prostitutes is an urgent matter and a responsibility that the government should fulfill. The "Little Star" in the garden of the hospital is Hong Kong's only shelter, but its capacity is limited to only thirteen people, while thousands of girls outside are in dire need of help. How can they be properly cared for? It is said that there are no fewer than 25,000 prostitutes in Hong Kong. The Salvation Army has only rescued a tiny fraction from prostitution. If there were shelters that could accommodate them, they would have a place to go. Who would then risk shame to engage in immoral activities? Finally, the Governor stated that the authorities are sympathetically considering the issue of subsidizing the Salvation Army to build more shelters and hope that practical solutions will be found soon.</p>
<h3>The Rice Shortage Remains Unresolved; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Again Appeals to the Central Government; Purchasing and Transporting Domestic Rice to Provide Relief is Too Slow to Meet the Urgent Need</h3>
<p>The rice shortage in Chaozhou and Meizhou is extremely severe. The Hong Kong Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying Prefecture Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly telegraphed China and Britain requesting the exemption of import duties on foreign rice to provide relief. Subsequently, they received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stating that it would be more appropriate to purchase and transport domestic rice for relief. The people of the two prefectures, hearing this news, feared that transporting domestic rice would be difficult and that large-scale relief would be impossible. The fear of starvation remains difficult to resolve, and many people are worried. Although purchasing and transporting foreign rice would affect foreign exchange reserves, the people's food supply and national defense are equally important. Both should be taken into consideration to provide relief. The Chaozhou and Jiaying Prefecture Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong are particularly concerned about this issue. Yesterday, they sent another urgent telegram to the central government, earnestly requesting this and asking Chairman Li of the provincial government to jointly appeal to the central government on their behalf to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong News in Brief</h3>
<p>...The Peking opera stars, Ms. Su Jin Ling and Ms. Lu Cui Lan, have previously performed in Hong Kong, and the beauty of their art has long been recognized.

The re-election will be held at the YMCA or the Hong Kong University Hall. The association's district branches will hold representative conferences during the day to determine their attitude towards the re-election.</p>
<p>...The Li Hang vessel, which had been out of service for a long time and used as a shelter for transiting soldiers, was recently transferred to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Steamship Company and renamed the Zhongshan vessel. After registering with the Hong Kong shipping authorities, the company issued a notice yesterday that if anyone has any objections to the transfer of the vessel, please submit them within seven days.</p>
<p>...Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson of the late former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who studied at Harvard, was recently sent to China to study races. He has already arrived in Shanghai and will come to Hong Kong and then go to the mainland to engage in anthropological research. The students of Guangzhou University, in order to connect the friendship between Chinese and American students and promote Chinese and American culture, plan to hold a welcome tea party when Mr. Roosevelt arrives in Hong Kong and invite him to give a speech.</p>
<h3>Mortality Rate Increases; 170 Deaths Last Week</h3>
<p>Health authorities warn that in the week ending Saturday, Hong Kong had 15 cases of convulsions, with 15 deaths (including two cases imported from outside), 19 cases of diphtheria, with 8 deaths, 20 cases of trauma, with 3 deaths, 80 cases of measles, with 30 deaths, 12 cases of chickenpox, with 2 deaths, 26 cases of meningitis, with 12 deaths, 13 cases of dysentery, with 7 deaths, 2 cases of scarlet fever, with 12 deaths, and 136 cases of tuberculosis, with 92 deaths.

<h3>Tea Exports Increase Sharply; All Concentrated in Hong Kong and Then Re-exported; Value in January Exceeds Two Million National Currency</h3>
<p>The China Trade Commission controls the export of foreign-owned tea, entrusting the Hong Kong China Tea Company and various tea firms to purchase it, and also requesting various Chinese-owned banks to provide tea loans. On the one hand, they are improving tea production and promoting tea production areas. Last year's tea exports totaled 416,246 quintals, worth 33,054,085 yuan. Hong Kong accounted for the largest share, with 239,099 quintals, worth 17,672,659 yuan. In January this year, exports were 26,901 quintals, worth 2,152,077 yuan. All are concentrated in Hong Kong and then re-exported to various countries (all figures in national currency). Before the war, foreign-owned tea exports were concentrated in Shanghai. After the war, the Trade Commission controlled them and concentrated them in Hong Kong. At that time, they agreed to the request of the Shanghai Foreign-Owned Tea Industry Association to allow Grade B tea, which was not suitable for the Soviet market, to be transported to Shanghai and sold by foreign-owned tea firms, provided that foreign exchange from exports was settled in accordance with the law. From this year on, all tea exports will be concentrated in Hong Kong and will not be allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale. As a result, various foreign-owned tea firms in Shanghai have sent personnel to establish branches or offices in Hong Kong to engage in foreign-owned tea exports.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Guangdong Situation, External Assistance is Lacking, Internal Controls are Tight; Our Forces in Western Guangdong Preparing for a Major Battle; Rising Waters in the West River Have Washed Away Many Defensive Installations Along the Banks; Deng Longguang Convenes a Military Conference to Discuss a Counter-Offensive Plan</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Zhaoqing) Our forces are preparing a large-scale counter-offensive from Guangdong, and a major battle is imminent. Although the situation in the western Guangdong region appears calm on the surface, the underlying circumstances are extremely tense. A summary of recent developments is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Gunboats Moving Towards the East and West Rivers</p>
<p>According to intelligence received from a military agency, more than twenty enemy shallow-draft warships and over a hundred armored electric boats and gunboats have been concentrated in the Pearl River estuary around White Swan Pool and Whampoa. In recent days, they have also been continuously moving towards the East and West Rivers. Their intention is believed to be a special operation, or they may be taking advantage of the heavy spring rains and high river levels to expand their encroachment along the waterways. Our military authorities have telegraphed orders to local defense forces to be prepared.</p>
<p>Enemy Busy Building Fortifications in Yangmei</p>
<p>The enemy forces in Sanshui have recently increased significantly, with various units identified, including elements of the enemy’s Fifth Division and the enemy’s Eighteenth Division. However, these are partial detachments and not complete divisions. On the 19th, another 500 enemy engineers arrived from Foshan via the Guangsan Railway to Hekou. After a brief rest, they immediately proceeded to the Ximei Jitang area to construct fortifications. The enemy is particularly focused on the Mafang line, deploying defenses along the coast at Langang, Mumian, and other locations to prevent our forces from crossing the river to attack and to provide opportunities to attack Sihui. They also fear that our forces from Lubao and Tanbu may outflank them, so they are urgently strengthening fortifications to resist. However, our encirclement is already complete, and even if the enemy fights desperately, they will find it difficult to escape our grasp.</p>
<p>Rising Waters in the West River Wash Away Enemy Bridge</p>
<p>To facilitate reinforcement and retreat, the enemy forces in Ge Wei had previously constructed two pontoon bridges using more than twenty large boats at Lao Ya Zhou, located between Hekou and Ge Wei. One bridge connected to Ge Wei, and the other connected to Hekou, allowing enemy troops in Hekou and Ge Wei to move freely between the two locations. Recently, rising waters in the West River caused the swift currents to wash away the pontoon bridge from Hekou to Ge Wei on the 18th. The enemy had repaired it not long ago, but it was washed away again. On the morning of the 19th, the enemy pontoon bridge from Lao Ya Zhou to Hekou was also washed away in several sections and could not be rebuilt. The enemy in Ge Wei is now in a state of panic, fearing that a large-scale attack by our forces will leave them with no escape route. They have sent more than a hundred soldiers from Hekou to Ge Wei by electric boat to hold the key points, and they have parked more than twenty boats along the shore to facilitate escape at any time.</p>
<p>Enemy Forcibly Consripts Laborers Without Paying Wages</p>
<p>Grain is extremely scarce in Sanshui. The enemy has looted all the grain reserves in the villages, and rice prices are soaring. Lower-quality rice costs around four catties per yuan, severely oppressing the people. If they do not die at the hands of the enemy, they will starve to death. Consequently, they are rising up in self-defense and joining the guerrillas. Seeing the perilous situation, the enemy has transported a large quantity of grain from Guangzhou and is implementing so-called "price stabilization" measures, with prices slightly lower than market prices to placate the people. However, each person is limited to buying only four mao of rice. Villagers forcibly conscripted to build fortifications and roads for the enemy are not paid wages, but are given three sheng of rice per day.</p>
<p>Our Forces Confer on Counter-Offensive Plan</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei of the Sixteenth Army Group believes that the enemy forces in the West River are exhausted due to insufficient troop strength, and this is a good time to launch a counter-offensive. He has dispatched Staff Officer Zhai to the front lines in Western Guangdong to relay counter-offensive plans. Staff Officer Zhai arrived in Zhaoqing yesterday and will hold a military conference in a designated location this week with Army Commander Deng Longguang to discuss operational strategies. Tax Police Commander Zhang Jun Song, Division Commander Wang De Quan Zhang Chi, Army Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shao Wu, and others have all been summoned by Army Commander Deng to return from the front lines to attend the conference. Commander-in-Chief Xia is currently occupied with important matters in the Southwest Headquarters, but he will rush back to the Western Guangdong front lines to take command as soon as he finishes. Military operations in Western Guangdong are rapidly escalating, and a major battle is imminent.</p>
<h3>Enemy Intends to Invade the West; Enemy Warships Massing at Weizhou Island; Situation in Beihai is Slightly Tense, but the Local Area is Peaceful; Traitors Spread Rumors, Authorities Establish a Communications Network</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou Bay] Lately, enemy warships have been patrolling and spying along the coast of Southern Guangdong. Enemy aircraft have been continuously bombing wildly, making the situation somewhat tense. In addition, traitors everywhere are spreading rumors, so the people's hearts are quite agitated. However, according to reports from various sources, due to the enemy's thin forces, a large-scale invasion of Southern Guangdong in the short term is not likely. The current expansion of harassment by enemy aircraft and warships is actually a deliberate demonstration of intimidation. Around the 15th, it was again widely rumored that the enemy had landed in Beihai. The reporter immediately inquired in various places. According to reports, on the morning of the 15th, one enemy cruiser sailed to the waters off Guantouling in Beihai. Around 10:00 a.m., one enemy shallow-draft warship was discovered, anchored about 10,000 meters from the coast, but there was no unusual activity. Around 3:00 p.m., the two warships sailed successively to the southwest. The rumor of an enemy landing is unfounded. Furthermore, more than ten enemy warships previously gathered off the coast of Yangjiang Dianbai have moved inland one after another, gathering in the waters between Weizhou Island and Haikou to spy on us. The situation in Beihai is therefore somewhat tense. Moreover, the newly appointed Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, Zhang Yan, and the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District, Deng Shizeng, after taking office, saw that the situation in the southern region was becoming increasingly tense and, to strengthen the defense, mobilized the masses to participate in the war. After discussing joint defense matters via telegram, they determined that during wartime, governance is closely related to transportation. However, highways are damaged, and the transmission of documents and information is difficult. A communications network must be re-established. Therefore, they have expanded and reorganized the original postal relay stations in various counties and established them widely in order to facilitate the transmission of all government orders and military information and to benefit the implementation of essential wartime policies.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Promulgates Measures for the Collection and Sale of Gold; Provincial Government Issues Orders to Subordinate Units to Publicize Widely</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] The Ministry of Finance states that silver shops collecting scrap gold, making utensils and jewelry for sale, was originally a kind of handicraft industry. Later, due to the market price of gold fluctuating and uncertain, silver shops arbitrarily raised prices for profit, with considerable suspicion of manipulating gold prices. It was stipulated that the Central Bank should consider the situation in various places and set the official price with the silver industry to avoid market manipulation. However, gold is a monetary reserve, and the Central Bank will redeem it according to the Gold Exchange Law. The business acting as an intermediary in this regard should immediately have its measures clearly defined. The Ministry of Finance has now formulated measures for the silver industry to buy and sell gold, and has sent them to provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to make them widely known. The provincial government has now issued orders to comply with these measures. The measures are recorded below: (A) Silver shops can only buy or sell pure gold and 90% gold in the form of ornaments or utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, placer gold, and ore gold are all prohibited from being bought or sold (unless accepted by the Central Bank). (B) Silver shops in all localities should comply with the method of setting gold prices agreed upon by the Central Bank and set official market prices. They must not privately negotiate market prices. In places where the Central Bank has no branches, they should consult with the silver industry and use the market prices announced by the four banks and silver rights industry in nearby places with branches as a standard. They are still not allowed to privately lower or raise prices arbitrarily. (C) If a silver shop violates the above two regulations, once verified, it should be suspended from business. The various gold utensils, gold ornaments, and raw materials for the above products stored by the silver shop that has been suspended from business shall be forcibly sold to the Central Bank, and legal tender shall be paid at the market price of the day. (D) From the date of promulgation of these measures, shops that specialize in buying placer gold and ore gold but do not also operate silver shops should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract accepting the commission to collect gold. All placer gold and ore gold collected should be sold to the Central Bank in full and should not be sold privately. Violators will be suspended from business. The placer gold and ore gold stored by the gold shop that has been suspended from business shall be forcibly sold to the Central Bank, and legal tender shall be paid at the market price of the day.</p>
<h3>Our Mafang Artillery Achievements; Annihilating the Enemy Suzuki Artillery Unit; Enemy Forces in the West River Constructing Defensive Works</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Western River] The war situation around Mafang has been quiet for a long time. For the past half month, the enemy forces have repeatedly attempted to invade the Mafang Jinli area, all to no avail. Since then, they have abandoned their attempts to invade from Mafang and have transferred enemy troops from the Mafang area to the Third and Fourth Highways, leaving only the Suzuki Artillery Unit and a portion of the Matsuno Tail Unit stationed in Mafang. On the morning of the 17th of this month, our artillery unit stationed in Mafang launched an attack on the enemy positions in Mafang, firing continuously at the enemy positions, hitting the enemy's fortifications. The enemy's Suzuki artillery positions were completely destroyed, and dozens of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. They had no power to retaliate. The artillery fire stopped at noon. Furthermore, the enemy forces in the Hekou area have also transported a large batch of stone concrete to build fortifications and have built pontoon bridges between Hekou and Lao Ya Zhou and between Lao Ya Zhou and Jiao Wei.</p>
<h3>A Certain Bank Employee in Shameen Relates the Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>A certain person who works at a certain bank in Shameen, Guangzhou, is currently in Hong Kong on official business for the head office. He arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago on the Jinshan Wheel from Guangzhou. He relates the details of Guangzhou as follows:</p>
<p>Unable to Govern</p>
<p>It has been several months since the enemy occupied Guangzhou, but they still have no way to govern. Therefore, public security in the city is becoming increasingly chaotic. Although this chaotic situation is sometimes reported in the newspapers, the details are lacking. The enemy is even better at propaganda and deception, so they have sent a large number of traitors to Hong Kong and Macau to spread deceptive rumors everywhere, saying how stable Guangzhou is now. Therefore, those who are deceived are unaware and fall into their trap. In recent days, quite a few people have returned to Guangzhou. However, after these people return to Guangzhou and witness this chaotic situation, it is difficult to escape again due to the complicated procedures.</p>
<p>Robbery Day and Night</p>
<p>Currently, most of the residents in the city, apart from a few legitimate businessmen who have shops in the city and have to risk returning to inspect them, are hooligans and thugs from the past and unemployed vagrants from nearby villages. Therefore, they go out to rob during the day, but at night, the enemy troops impose a curfew, and the hooligans and thugs dare not come out. The enemy troops move through the shops, ostensibly for inspection but actually to rob. Therefore, there are dozens of robbery cases every day.</p>
<p>City Commerce</p>
<p>Most of the shops in the city are operated by enemy merchants. Not a single official shop has reopened. Grain is entirely controlled by the enemy, and each yuan of military banknotes ("approximately one yuan and three or four cents in national currency") can only buy four catties. The enemy troops are constrained by our attached military units and often impose curfews. Once a curfew is imposed, the supply of food in the city is completely cut off. Even Shameen is affected, and sometimes bread is used instead of rice.</p>
<p>Inspection Disputes</p>
<p>All residents must obtain a Good Citizen Certificate and a Pass. There are two factions within the enemy army, causing many disputes for citizens who wear these certificates. The area from the Tianzi Wharf to the Xidi Shameen West Bridge Huangsha is guarded by the enemy Marine Corps. The enemy troops in this section are very strict in their inspections. Regardless of whether Chinese or Westerners pass through, they must be subjected to rigorous inspection. A person of a certain nationality was injured by the enemy army for refusing inspection. Therefore, all Good Citizen Certificates in this section must be kept hidden when passing through, because the certificate was issued by the enemy army. However, the entire section east of the Dazi Wharf is guarded by the army. Citizens must hang their Good Citizen Certificate when they go to that section, otherwise they will not only be unable to pass through, but also be in danger of being arrested. The infighting between the two factions is now fierce.</p>
<p>Puppet Special Zone</p>
<p>The entire Henan district is a gathering place for traitors and vagrants. Puppet maintenance committees have been established here, and opium dens and gambling houses are everywhere, so the order is even more chaotic. There are many robbery cases, and there are also several cases of fighting and assassination every day. Therefore, this area has become a special zone for traitors, and other citizens dare not mix in.</p>
<p>Shameen Houseboats</p>
<p>From the east bank to the Xidi along the river bank, the enemy fears that our guerrilla units will infiltrate the houseboats. All houseboats, large and small, are not allowed to moor there. The river opposite the Big Clock Tower has become a quiet river, with no boats interspersed between them except for the enemy navy's small steam boats. The enemy troops have only designated the south bank of Shameen as a place for boats to moor. Therefore, prostitutes and boat women are using these houseboats as temporary brothels, and the daily fee for overnight stays is two yuan in military currency. Most of these prostitutes are boat women. In addition, there are more than ten Zi Dong boats, which are women from the enemy country.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Civilian Property</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the puppet maintenance committee has moved all the furniture and sundries from the undamaged civilian houses in the city. The civilian houses are sealed. Now, any citizens who are deceived and return to the city must pay a registration fee to them before they are given housing. Even the owners must pay a fee to the puppet committee to get their houses back. This method is tantamount to looting.</p>
<p>Difficult to Escape the Lair</p>
<p>The enemy uses various methods, dispatching traitors to lure our compatriots back to the city as much as possible. After returning to the city, the enemy will seize the citizens' national currency and foreign currency as much as possible and force them to exchange it for military currency. Then, it is not easy to get an exit permit from the enemy to leave the city again. Even if you want to take foreign ships such as the Shameen or Jinshan ships to leave the city, the sailing schedule is uncertain, and the price of tickets is eight Hong Kong dollars. There are no silver coin exchange shops in the city, and military currency cannot be used to buy ship tickets. Therefore, it is difficult to enter the city, but it is difficult to escape this lair.</p>
<p>Demonstration Parade</p>
<p>Recently, our armies have gathered and the atmosphere for a counteroffensive against Guangzhou is extremely strong. Furthermore, fearing that our citizens will leave the city upon hearing the news, on the one hand, they spread rumors that we cannot retake Guangzhou, and on the other hand, they put on a demonstration. Therefore, last week they held a demonstration parade. All the enemy troops stationed in Guangzhou participated, and they tried their best to mobilize the tanks stationed in Guangzhou to participate in the demonstration parade in order to convince our people not to leave the city. However, apart from the puppets who participated, most of the citizens were afraid that something would happen and closed their doors. The enemy's skills can be seen to have reached the end of the road.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters; Li Han Hun Appointed Chairman</h3>
<p>By order of the Central Party Headquarters to reorganize, the Central Standing Committee decided to reassign Li Han Hun, Yu Han Mou, Qiu Yu, Miao Pei Ji, Huang Lin Qun, Gao Xin, Cai Yao Bo Long, Yu Sen Wen, and Sun Dai Tao as committee members, and appointed Li Han Hun as chairman and Yu Sen Wen as secretary-general.

Furthermore, after the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the members of the current provincial government took office on January 1 but did not formally hold an inauguration ceremony. The provincial committees will hold a joint oath-taking ceremony with the members of the provincial party headquarters on April 1.</p>

<h3>It Was Only Yesterday</h3>
<p>Clark Gable is a household name today. When he walks on the MGM studio lot, people point and stare, all paying attention to him. But do you know that in this same location, he once bared his blackened body, with only a leopard skin around his waist, and awkwardly held a red rose, causing great laughter? When he dressed like this, he came out of the makeup department and went to the studio for a screen test. The workers saw him on the way, they whistled, they yelled at him strangely. But Gable didn't care, he still held the rose tightly, and just wanted to finish his road quickly.</p>
<p>This was the situation when he first came to the MGM studio. He had been appreciated by film director Leon Barimore in Los Angeles, and invited him to do a screen test. He came as scheduled, and was first led to the wardrobe department. There, they gave him a leopard skin, a short blade, and a rose, and then asked him to go to the makeup department. In the makeup department, he told them his name, and was stripped naked. Then, two people, without asking why, painted him completely black from head to toe. "Okay, put on that leopard skin, and go to Studio Seven quickly." "How can I go out like this?" he protested. They said, "No one will notice you."</p>
<p>That was true. In the studio, strange people are not uncommon. But the bad thing was that red rose. A rose in the hand is easier to attract attention than ten roses on a tree. He didn't walk ten feet out the door before someone started yelling. He started running, but the rose was still in his hand. Gable said that he had never heard so many whistles, and there happened to be a group of visitors that day, which made him very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Running to Studio Seven, panting, he angrily complained to Leon about the insults he had suffered. Leon said, "Forget about these things. These idiots may be congratulating a new star tomorrow. Go over there, and do whatever I tell you to do." Gable suppressed his anger and, with a full hope of becoming a star, walked to the camera. "What should I do with this unlucky rose?" "Put it behind your left ear... No, your right ear," Leon said, closing one eye from the camera to look at him. This was the test. Leon took him to see Owen Thalberg, who just told them to get out quickly. They were both drunk and a little confused.</p>
<p>Clark Gable only recently told this strange experience. He said that even now, whenever he feels angry, as long as he thinks of that red rose, the anger disappears immediately.</p>
<p>Among the red youngsters, there are a few who have a story to announce from the grain. Don Ameche is worthy of the word "red", but not long ago he was still a performer in a street art troupe. Tyrone Power also worked at an exposition, standing in front of the door to attract visitors. Robert Taylor only earned thirty-five yuan a week when he first came to MGM. Fred Astaire, after watching his "Dancing Carioca," was willing to return his salary to the company as long as they could destroy the film, which shows his dissatisfaction with his performance. However, it was this film that made him emerge late and leap to the throne of a red star. I'm afraid not many people know these strange things.</p>
<p>Do you know about an embarrassing incident in the early years of Jeanette MacDonald? She was performing in a dance at the Liberty Theatre on Forty-Second Street. Once, while kicking her legs, she used too much force, and a shoe flew out of the air, over the heads of the orchestra, and landed squarely on the lap of Swanson's husband in the fourth row. Of course, Jeanette was very embarrassed, not only because she was barefoot, but also because the shoe was dirty and old. She was afraid that Mrs. Swanson, who was picky, would get angry about this.</p>
<p>Eleanor Powell's entry into the film industry also had a fortuitous story. She won first prize in a dance competition in "Atlantic City", and the prize was a ticket to a boxing match. She went, and it happened that the great director David Selznick was also there. He discovered her. It seems that she should also thank that boxing match for her success today. That was the battle between Dempsey and Flrpo.</p>
<p>Adolphe Menjou once had a fight with a professor and was punched down the stairs by that professor. But later, they both entered the film industry, and that professor was Louis Wolheim.</p>
<p>When George Burns and Gracie Allen were married in Cleveland in 1926, he could only afford an eighteen-dollar wedding ring for her. And now?</p>
<p>You may know that Rodolfo Valentino and Alice Faye have never been happy with each other, but do you know why? This is actually a one-sided resentment. Rodolfo never spoke to her much, and only greeted her slightly when he saw her. The origin of this matter is that after Rodolfo Valentino brought Alice Faye into the film industry, Alice Faye became famous. To show her gratitude to him, she sang along whenever Rodolfo Valentino's orchestra went east to perform. When Rodolfo Valentino gave her a monetary reward, she refused to accept it. After a few times, a discord made the previous goodwill disappear completely. That was when the orchestra arrived in Manhattan one time, before Alice had gone. Rodolfo had already announced Alice's joining the singing in the newspaper, but as a result, she called and said that she could not come. Rodolfo Valentino thought that she had deliberately taken his platform apart, and never spoke to her again, although Alice still had the intention of reconciling, but she never got a chance.</p>
<p>The above are all things published by Xin Yi. Although they are not things that happened recently, they look like they are happening now. At the earliest, it was only yesterday.</p>
<h3>Throwback to Celebrities' Strange Gifts</h3>
<p>Gary Cooper once received an old, rusty handgun from a ranch manager. It was found in a cave and said to be the relic of a famous bandit from many years ago.</p>
<p>After Paul Muni starred in "The Good Earth," he received a particularly interesting gift: a year's subscription to a Chinese newspaper, sent by a Chinese person. Although he couldn't understand a word, he felt happy every time the newspaper arrived.</p>
<p>Remember Birt Wheeler and Robert Woolsey? Woolsey was always chewing on an oversized cigar. A fan, knowing this, sent him a box of extremely high-quality cigars. Woolsey excitedly opened it and took a puff. Just as he was getting comfortable, "bang!" The cigar exploded, leaving only half. He tried another, but it was the same. The prankster fan had played a significant trick on him.</p>
<p>Louise Rainer once received a live, small carp and didn't know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Every Christmas, Jack Oakie would receive a pair of hand-knitted wool socks from an old woman. She probably loved him like her own son. Indeed, having a "big fat son" like Oakie wasn't the worst thing.</p>
<p>On one occasion, an inmate sent him a belt made of rope, which was quite exquisitely crafted. Jack was deeply moved and sent the gift giver five dollars as a reward. Unexpectedly, this started a trend, and more than a dozen belts poured in, all sent by inmates.</p>
<p>Joan Blondell had a Mexican fan who sent her gifts year-round, mostly leather goods. She felt a bit bad about it and deliberately replied, saying she had given everything he sent to her husband, Dick Powell, because the gifts were entirely unsuitable for her. Her wording wasn't very polite, naturally intending for him to stop spending money on gifts. However, the Mexican wasn't fazed at all. Instead, he wrote back, saying that since that was the case, he would send the gifts directly to Mr. Dick Powell from now on, saving her the trouble of forwarding them. Sure enough, he actually did this later, even sending some items suitable for women. This happened last year. It's unknown whether this generous gentleman is still continuing to send gifts.</p>
<p>Usually, gifts for celebrities are mostly small, exquisite, and fun items. However, a fan of Rosalind Russell had a unique idea and sent something enormous: a rather large oak tree. Rosalind planted it in her garden.</p>

<h3>Today's First Division Football League: Eastern and Scots to Meet Again at 5 PM at the Hong Kong Ground</h3>
<p>(Special Report from Hong Kong) The mystery of the First Division Football League championship has yet to be revealed. However, based on the current situation, the top three teams in the continuing standings are the main contenders. In terms of continuing points, Navy has played nineteen games with twenty-nine points, South China has played eighteen games with twenty-eight points, and Eastern has also played eighteen games with twenty-five points. Navy has only one remaining game against South China, while South China, apart from this game, must also cross the harbor to face Kowloon. Eastern, on the other hand, will face the strong teams Scots and Middlesex. Therefore, the championship situation is still up for grabs. The outcome will only become clear after this week's games, depending on the performance of the top three teams. If South China can beat Kowloon on Saturday and Sunday and then defeat Navy, their score will exceed all others, securing the championship. If they are unfortunately defeated by Kowloon, losing one point to Navy, then the final battle against Navy will be a matter of life and death, decided by this move. However, South China must win to have a chance; defeat is hopeless, and even a draw will not help. Therefore, the key to South China's championship lies not in the game against Navy, but in the game against Kowloon on Saturday. If they can defeat Kowloon, their position will be more stable, and in the future game against Navy, they only need to avoid defeat; even a draw will secure the championship.</p>
<p>Eastern's points are two less than Navy's, so their position is slightly lower. They can only watch others succeed or fail and profit from it. However, they must still defeat Scots and the Middlesex Regiment to have a chance. If they win both games and indirectly benefit from South China defeating Navy, their score after twenty games will be the same as Navy's. In that case, an additional decisive battle will be necessary to determine the runner-up. In short, Eastern has not given up hope for the runner-up position.</p>
<p>This afternoon at 5 PM, Eastern will play against Scots. The strength of the two teams is not far apart, and it is expected that there will be fierce competition after the game starts. However, it is doubtful whether Eastern will field the same lineup, as Hau Ching-to and Song Ling-sheng have foot injuries that have not fully healed, especially Ching-to, whose injury is more serious. Yesterday, the reporter met him in the mountains and asked if he would be able to play today. He said that he intended to rest and would not participate in this game. If so, Eastern's front line will be missing a key player, and the attacking power will be slightly reduced. It is said that Yu Qia-xing will replace Ching-to. As for Ling-sheng's injury, it has slightly improved. For the sake of the overall situation, he will reluctantly play today and serve as a forward, with Xu Jing-cheng becoming the center forward. Judging from this, the lineup is still relatively complete. They should be confident in defeating Scots. However, it is hoped that those who are playing with injuries will not get hurt again and will work together to strive for victory. Scots are soldiers, and their fighting is brave. Those who encounter them should be careful, as they are easily injured. For the sake of Eastern's future, I hope that the entire army will be intact at that time, so as not to suffer unexpected losses.</p>
<p>Yesterday it rained, and it is not known what the weather will be like today. If the weather is not favorable, the players will feel difficult to play. Moreover, competing with the brave Scots soldiers is even more disadvantageous. Therefore, whether it is sunny or rainy today is very important to the Eastern players. If the weather is clear and the ground is dry, Eastern's front line, which is known for its surprise attacks, can be fully deployed, posing a great threat to Scots, and victory will not be difficult. If the field is muddy and slippery, and it takes a lot of effort to run, I am afraid that Eastern's forwards will not perform as well as they want. It is hoped that all members will work together to find ways to overcome the difficult environment, and then two points will naturally be obtained. At the same time, the defense must be wary of the Scots forwards' rushes, as the front line has no tactics to speak of, but the rushes are terrible. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Eastern</p>
<p>Lau Hin-hon, Miu Wah-kwok, Tsang Chung-wan</p>
<p>Lo Wai, Hui Jing-cheng, Lau Chi-tuk</p>
<p>Yu Chi-hing, Song Ling-sheng, Lee Tak-kee, Ng Ki-cheung, Chan Bing-to</p>

<h3>Taikoo Chinese Sports Association to Hold Mini-Football League and Elect Officers Next Month</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Chinese Sports Association held a cadre meeting yesterday at its premises in Sai Wan Ho. Attendees included Lin Zhong-si, Zhu Fu-xian, Zeng Jing-kang, He Kun, and others. The important resolutions are listed below: The election of new officers was decided to be held on the 3rd of next month. The football department proposed to hold a mini-football league for Taikoo Dockyard employees. It was resolved that the matter should be handled by Zeng Jing-kang and Dai Guo-lin, as it would help promote friendship among the workers. Also, the Dockyard Clerks team will play against the Garage team at the Taikoo Stadium to review their strength. The time is Friday at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Basketball Games: Star Island Defeats Hong Kong University, Ching Chik Defeats Hai Kwong, South China Loses to Taichung</h3>
<p>Second Division</p>
<p>The Public Men's Basketball League originally scheduled two Second Division games last night, and the First Division game between Pui Ying and South China was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Later, the Federation obtained the consent of the Star Island and Hong Kong University teams to temporarily play a game, so there were still three games held.</p>
<p>In the first game, South China played against Taichung. Both sides were evenly matched. Luo Hua-zhang, He Qing-he, Zhuo Hong-fei, Zhuo Guo-rong, and others from South China all made contributions. Xiao Qi-biao, Zheng Jia-biao, Zheng Kang-yong, Wu Yao-kun, Li Qi, and others from Taichung also performed well. However, Taichung's defense was stronger, and they eventually defeated South China 35-31.</p>

<p>In the last game, Star Island played against Hong Kong University. Star Island's attacking power was stronger, and Hong Kong University was not willing to show weakness, fighting bravely. However, Star Island's passing was fast, and the forwards coordinated well, repeatedly breaking through with unexpected attacks, causing Hong Kong University to be exhausted. After the game started, Xu Kun-lun of Hong Kong University opened the scoring first. Li Shi-jie of Star Island was unwilling to be outdone and launched a strong attack, teaming up with Li Pei-yan and Zhong Zhi-qiang to attack continuously, breaking through several times. Lu Zhen-xuan also contributed by pushing the attack. Hong Kong University tried their best to support, and there were also some results. In the first half, Star Island took the lead 26-16. After switching sides, Pan Yao-jun, Dai Fu-cheng, and Liang Guo-duo, fresh troops, were sent out, and Xin Zhong-jian also rose up to attack, launching a strong offensive. The score rose sharply. When it reached 39-24, Lu Zhen-xuan returned to the battle, and it was unstoppable. Xu Kun-lun, Yang Xu-hua, Zhang Shao-mian, and others tried hard to support, but to no avail. At the end of the game, Hong Kong University lost 26-49.</p>

<h3>An Easy Victory: South China Easily Defeats St. Joseph's</h3>
<p>Four players in the front line made contributions; General Da Shu did not take credit.</p>
<p>South China suffered a narrow defeat to the Police last week, and Navy was also defeated by Eastern, causing a sudden change in the standings. However, after suffering a disastrous defeat last week, South China went all out in yesterday's game against St. Joseph's, being cautious and careful, not daring to relax at all. As a result, they returned victorious with a score of five to one, showing that South China's efforts will surely bear fruit. However, they still have two games to play. If they can continue to work hard, the championship will surely belong to them. The South China players must work hard.</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the game, South China began to attack. Jing-xiang supervised the attack, surrounding St. Joseph's goal like an iron bucket. Soon, they forced a corner kick, which was taken by Dou-wen. The landing point was very accurate, but it was caught by the goalkeeper who jumped high. St. Joseph's took the opportunity to counterattack, and Li-an-na got the ball 20 yards from the goal and shot, but it went over the goal and failed to score.</p>
<p>Soon after, Er-xiang intercepted the ball in the center line, picked it over Yilinshi, and Sousa, seeing the situation was not good, rushed forward. Jing-xiang quickly passed it to Dou-wen, who did not fail his mission and scored with a shot, opening the scoring. After the center line kick-off, South China took advantage of the victory to pursue, and St. Joseph's made a desperate defense. Soon, they lost a corner kick, which was taken by Guang-sen. Dou-jiang Xia Xian jumped high to meet the ball, but the ball was reflected out. Guang-sen added another kick, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>South China quickly won two goals, with a hundred times more courage. St. Joseph's also tried to counterattack. Pala-ci got a pass from Li-an-na and rushed straight up. 30 yards from the goal, he passed it to Jin-shi, who shot over the goal and failed to score. South China counterattacked, Guang-sen got the ball and went straight up along the side, passing it to Qunli-yi shot, but it was blocked by Xia Xian. The ball happened to fall in front of Zhao-rong, and he pushed it into the net, making it 3-0. St. Joseph's counterattacked again, attacking straight towards South China's goal, but fortunately, the two inner guards tried their best to grab the ball, and nothing happened. After a few minutes, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints that day, the two sides did not rest. At the end of the first half, they immediately switched sides and fought again. Seeing that they had lost three goals in a row, St. Joseph's tried to break the duck egg. Di-lu-jia-du and A-lu-wei-shi switched positions, so there was a sudden attack, leaving Jue-jue in danger. However, A-shi's inner victory was too eager, and he actually used his hand to push the ball into the net in front of the goal. However, because the operation was not clever, it was seen by the referee, and he was penalized for handball. South China then cleared the siege.</p>
<p>Not long after, St. Joseph's attacked again, forcing a corner kick. Jin-shi got a chance in front of the goal and shot quickly, breaking the duck egg. Seeing that they had lost a goal, South China launched a full counterattack. Jing-xiang got the ball and passed it to En-liang, who shot and scored immediately. At this point, St. Joseph's was completely defeated, completely losing their fighting power. After a while, Zhao-rong went to the meeting alone. Mas-kui and Sousa rushed forward to stop him, and they were penalized for a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Guang-sen shot in, making the final score 5-1.</p>

<h3>About Sholokhov</h3>
<p>—Original by V. Novich, translated by You Qiu</p>
<p>The whole Soviet Union knows Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned". These two novels have been repeatedly read by millions of people, from which they draw aesthetic pleasure and rich national knowledge, the various levels of the people and the genes of their actions.</p>
<p>The power of Sholokhov's literary work is not only due to his artistic talent; the indispensable value of his works lies in the fact that the author is a Bolshevik and an active builder of socialism. His multifaceted participation in national life every day is the most accurate way to learn about people's lives. It gives Sholokhov's works that enthusiasm, love and hatred, that ideal courage, enabling the author (like a scientist) to objectively understand life and present a faithful picture in his works.</p>
<p>This is a characteristic, so Sholokhov is one of the outstanding realists in literature.</p>
<p>Sholokhov is one of the most talented and popular writers in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Because of the comprehensive observation in his works, he is able to present a faithful and thorough depiction of the complex and contradictory progress of the new life in the Soviet countryside from all sides, so his works are remarkable.</p>
<p>The peasants Sholokhov writes about are not ordinary peasants, but a special group of peasants, the most fixed class division among the Cossack masses. The Cossacks have been systematically and persistently misled by despotism. He gave them various privileges, giving them the possibility of status advancement and the reward of acquiring money and land, making them produce personal extravagance. Moreover, the Cossacks are accustomed to being used as tools to suppress the revolution, arousing the people's natural hostility towards the Cossacks, making the Cossacks stand in an independent position.</p>
<p>These people do not understand that their interests are consistent with the interests of all peasants. They regard themselves as supporters of autocratic politics. Under this situation, it is clear that it is difficult to break the dreams of private property owners.</p>
<p>Sholokhov does not avoid this difficulty. In his wonderfully depicted realistic characters, we see the shadows of these people's internal resistance aroused by the fundamental changes in their way of life.</p>
<p>At the same time, we see how life itself crushes the old system; how the masses' struggle towards a new life grows and develops; and how the Soviet power, which gives the people's desires form, organization and direction, encounters the struggle.</p>
<p>All of this is consciously reflected in Sholokhov's works. His realistic talent and Marxist viewpoint enable him to expose and proclaim the direction of this development without evading or embellishing these contradictions, which makes the characters he creates complete, vivid and poetic.</p>
<p>In "And Quiet Flows the Don", Grigory, Mikrika, Aksinia, Old Mikrika, and Natalia; in "Virgin Soil Upturned", Nagulnov and Razmetnov, and many other characters live for the reader, erasing many habitual fixed concepts of people and life, enhancing the deep internal belief in the correct path chosen by the socialist country.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of Sholokhov's works is his extremely rich vocabulary, which helps him to convey the reactions tempered by the revolution to the readers in the language of ordinary people, especially the language of the Don region farmers.</p>
<p>He works with ordinary scientific intuition and artistic talent, which enables him to organically combine the choice of words with the structure of the dialect, throwing away purely crude slang. From this point of view, Sholokhov is the newest and most courageous creator of a new literary language in Soviet literature.</p>
<h3>Notes of a War Correspondent</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mai Sui</p>
<p>"... Suei Meng News Agency Film Department member Mataro Hanabusa (30 years old) ... departed from Guangzhou on the 28th, bivouacked in Foshan on the 29th, and at 8:30 AM on the 30th, led by Captain Taita of the military headquarters ... left Foshan by car ... arrived in Sanshui at noon, and at 1:00 PM under the command of the Watanabe Unit, took a naval boat from Sanshui to Jiushui Village, about six kilometers southwest, sailing down the West River. At 1:30 PM, near Hezhougang (about five kilometers from Sanshui), from the high ground on the right bank of the West River, was suddenly attacked by fierce fire from the × people ... Under a hail of bullets, Hanabusa was suddenly hit and fell into the water ... Immediately drowned. The boat was quickly turned around to fight back against the × people and rescue him. At that time, Hanabusa-kun's figure floated on the surface again, still holding his beloved camera. Before approaching, there was no time to take out a bamboo pole, and he sank into the water. The boat turned back to observe, bathed in enemy fire, busy fighting back. Later, another search was conducted near the area, but nothing was found. A request was made for two naval boats and two small boats from nearby to assist in the search ... The water was 30 meters deep, and the current was extremely fast ... Declared hopeless."</p>
<p>The night is quiet. In front of me, a candle silently extends its long tongue of fire, as if pushing away the darkness and illuminating me. It has become the Chinese white paper and ink box, writing the words "In memory of the heroic spirit of the late Taro Hanabusa, died in battle photographing enemy lines near Sanshui on November 30th, Showa 13," nailed to the top of the altar with small nails. Opening my eyes, "Ah! Hanabusa-kun is really dead," I began to have a personal sense of reality. I cried alone. Although Guangdong has now fallen, I don't know how the death of Hanabusa will move those who are indifferent to sweeping up the remaining enemies! Doesn't the war to recapture Guangdong and sweep up the remaining enemies require battle? I stare at the candlelight, meditating in the quiet darkness on the deep and long war, and the deeper we go into the interior, the more endless the struggle is! (The End)</p>
<h3>Distant Ballad</h3>
<p>— Huang Lu</p>
<p>When the bugle call of dawn sounds</p>
<p>I miss the eyes</p>
<p>That fly over thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles</p>
<p>On the other side of the mountains, on the other side of the sea</p>
<p>Under the distant sky</p>
<p>In the snowy field of blood</p>
<p>In the difficult homeland</p>
<p>On the body</p>
<p>Of a free warrior</p>
<p>I miss</p>
<p>The trees by the stream</p>
<p>And the mountains...</p>
<h3>The Production of New Realist Literature</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In literature, works of new realism are produced after works of new idealism. Originally, the advantage of realism lay in writing nakedly, realistically, vividly, and thoroughly, consistent with reason, which makes it deeply intense and gives it a strong power to move people. Because the romantic school before the realist school fell into fantasy due to idealism, and enthusiasm flowed into delusions, being weak and powerless, it was overwhelmed by the realist school. ——The attitude of the romantic school is close to play, and it cannot satisfy the desires of general serious readers, which is why the solemn and tense realist school arose. From this it can be seen that in deeply exploring problems and carefully studying the use of life, realism is better than relying on imagination. However, the realist school focuses on the reproduction of facts, which is inevitably constrained. When society is extremely chaotic, there are too many ugly things, and revolutionary means are needed to quickly change them, it is not enough to save the entire society with serious ailments by only relying on the realist school to expose the inherent environmental phenomena in a satirical way as an attack on the dark side, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches. Moreover, later naturalists neglect the bright side and always focus on the depiction of the dark side, revealing too much sadness, which inevitably makes people feel depressed. Readers in a gray environment are already depressed enough, and writing gray works naturally makes them more depressed, feeling hopeless and disappointed.</p>
<p>The remedy is to focus on the depiction of brightness, make people optimistic, actively express role models who are proactive, and encourage them, so that after readers understand what they should do, they will naturally and unconsciously put it into practice, in order to fundamentally transform the bad environment. Such proactive role models do not have ready-made models available in the inherent facts, so they can only be constructed by the author. This is the characteristic of new idealism. For example, before, there were no figures who could actually resist the invasion of the Japanese and the oppression of the puppet regime that could be used as ready-made prototypes. However, resistance must be prepared, and resistance must be advocated in literature. Therefore, the so-called nationalism literature at that time was propaganda to prepare for resistance. In addition to using stories of ancient national heroes to inspire, we had to adopt the means of new idealism to create model figures. From this it can be seen that it is an unavoidable matter in non-aesthetic life literature to create characters out of fiction: if there are ready-made models available, it is not only easier, but also more realistic. It is also easy to move people.</p>
<p>Now it is good, for more than a year and a half since the official war of resistance, in the fierce national revolution, many loyal men and generals who charged into battle and shed blood in the front lines are role models for the youth in the rear. The stories of the martyrs who gave their lives for the country with enthusiasm and excitement are good materials for enlightening future generations. Moreover, the activities of the guerrillas who are struggling everywhere, their hard work and endurance, and the various processes of victory and defeat can all be used as reference materials for the general public, as their examples, inspiring them to actually participate in the war. Or prepare earnestly to prevent the invasion of the Japanese. These facts, although they are past events, are exactly the ideal things that people who have not participated in them are seeking. To adopt themes from ideals is simply because the facts of the past are not enough to apply; now that there are so many vivid facts, why not use them?</p>
<p>Recording these new facts is a work of new realism. Although it is a "reproduction", it has the same "expression" effect as general works of new idealism. Not only can it be used as a demonstration propaganda among the majority of people in our country, but it can also be extended to various oppressed and small nations to be used flexibly. Because these facts are all model behaviors of uniting, fighting, resisting the strong, and defending oneself.</p>
<p>The so-called literature of new realism is not that the writing method is new, but that it is new in the nature of the theme, and this newness is not just "only recently" but is based on conditions such as resisting Japan, supporting justice, and jointly protecting justice and humanity. Works of new realism were rarely seen before except in Soviet literature, because there were so many of these facts only in the great revolution in the Soviet Union. In the future, we can also have many new realist literature. Although the nature is slightly different, the function of being realistic and able to demonstrate and encourage is the same. Whether it is the spirit of firm belief and perseverance in "The Torrent", or the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice in "Destruction" and "One Week", we have all had them. Like the protagonist in "The Fourteenth", we already have them too. Not to mention the experiences of ten years of hard fighting and ten thousand miles of marching: the facts of the Eight Hundred Heroes and the isolated army fighting in Shanghai and on the battlefields, the brave soldiers' selfless feats can all be written into moving masterpieces.</p>
<p>The large-scale production of new realist literature will now become a by-product of our country's war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3>Dreams Outside Lei Yue Mun</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>Conte Rosso gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.</p>
<p>Empress of Canada gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.</p>
<p>Leaving a homesick heart at the foot of "Flagstaff Hill," gazing at the masts of ships returning east on the sea during the day, and dreaming of flying outside Lei Yue Mun at night, how light the dream is—</p>
<p>Shanghai, this declining island, is not my hometown, but sixteen years of history have floated through my young life. It is not my hometown, but it is close to my heart, my motherland's land.</p>
<p>I have been in Southern China for two full years in May. Like a swallow, I want to go back for a while, to see this bleak old home, which has my footprints, my friends, my purple poems, my gray dreams, and the shadow of my blue past.</p>
<p>"No one can catch me"?</p>
<p>I have lived in Guangzhou in a brown dream</p>
<p>I have walked through Wuzhou, growing in hardship</p>
<p>I have walked through Liuzhou, where the river water is as clear as a mirror</p>
<p>I have walked through Guilin, a strange picture</p>
<p>I have walked through</p>
<p>I have walked through Guangzhou, which smells like rotting bananas</p>
<p>In a rocking sea ship, I am left in gray Hong Kong, enduring the fishy smell of the sea, the warm low pressure, not knowing when the end will come.</p>
<p>Conte Rosso gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.</p>
<p>Empress of Canada gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.</p>
<p>Leaving a homesick heart at the foot of "Flagstaff Hill", gazing at the masts of ships returning east on the sea during the day, and dreaming of flying outside Lei Yue Mun at night, how light and illusory the dream is!</p>

<h3>Manchurian Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>"Do you think I can't hear it? Then I would have lived fifty years in vain." As she spoke, the lamplight shortened and went out. In the pitch-black bedroom, a human-shaped shadow deepened further. It was still the maid's voice: "Miss, where are you? Don't cry! What are you upset about? - Did that guest who just came offend you? - It must be, it must be - my ears are my eyes. As soon as I heard that young man's words, I knew he was not a good thing - Miss, where are you? I'm telling you, as soon as I saw that young man's eyes, it scared me to death! I felt like I had encountered a will-o'-the-wisp, not at all - alas, he also brought a gust of yin air, which really makes people shiver - I was thinking, tonight, I could - I really don't have good luck, I was afraid that the young lady would also have bad luck. It's true, I didn't think wrong." - At this time, the maid's two listeners: one trembling, crying softly, one hiding behind the clothes rack, almost afraid to breathe. The former and the latter, at the same time, fell into two different types of terror. One of them thought:</p>
<p>"This useless maid, why don't you ring the alarm? Don't you know that I have already been…"</p>
<p>The other one thought:</p>
<p>"If she shouts, what will I do? It's over. The best result is that I can only escape, but I should think of a way to deal with this woman; otherwise, when it dawns in a while, her words will probably not be finished!"</p>
<p>Yes, the maid's words, as if she had just reached the climax; she continued: "Miss, where are you? Turn on the light, let me chat with the young lady to ease your mind. I'd better turn on the light first!"</p>
<p>(Fifteen)</p>
