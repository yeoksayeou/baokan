<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>精神總動員之國際的意義</h3>
<p>— 錢俊瑞</p>
<p>精神動員是政治動員的中心，而政治動員又是全民總動員的起點。全民動員而沒有政治動員做基礎，那末人力和物力的動員便不結實，不深入。同時，精神動員——政治動員之後，如果沒有全民人力和物力的總動員、那末所謂精神動員和政治動員便落空，便玄虛。</p>
<p>從前日俄打仗帝俄對外要侵略，對內却腐敗不堪。沙皇不用砲彈運給軍隊，却把聖像一車一車供給將士，於是兵士就發氣的說：「日本人拿砲彈打我們，而我們則拿聖像去打他們。』這也是精神動員，但這是侵略者的精神動員、和我們完全不同。</p>
<p>現在德意法西斯蒂也行精神動員。希特勒要實現『第三帝國』，獨覇歐洲，便不惜利用宗敎皇帝等偶像，自弄玄虛；叫百姓省下麵包換大砲，束緊褲帶當砲灰。希特勒精神動員的目標，是日耳曼人第一，（見國社黨政策大綱第四條規定）實際是大資本家第一，日爾曼大衆也是受苦）是趕走猶太人！（實在是趕走反法西人民！）是剝奪百姓眞正的選舉權，參政權和言諭出版的自由！（政策大綱第六第二十三條），是規定勞動人民個個要替資本家服役；（第十條）是大德意志國家主義！（第二十條）！是全國皆兵，都應替金融寡頭當砲灰（第二十條）！</p>
<p>墨索里尼有墨索里尼的一套，來行精神動員，慨括言之，他的精神動員有七大目標：第一，消滅省市自治；第二，封閉一切非意大利語文的學校；禁止用外國語；第三，改變民埃特有的姓氏；第四，絕對禁止結社，第六，沒有出版報祇的自由：禁止任何形式的政治生活；第七，建設恐怖和暴力政治，（見Count　Corlo　Sforza法西之十年，美外交雜誌第十一期）。</p>
<p>最有味的，我們的×人也在實行精神動員。×人現在頂苦的是國內的不安一般人民的反戰思想和反戰運動就是日本軍閥法西斯蒂的掘墓人，所以他們的精神動員主要在壓制百姓的思想，禁止百姓一切集會結社的自由；其動員的工具還是武士道。他們給士兵的慰勞還是佛像和千人針，他們所謂『長期建設』的理論敎百姓長期做奴隸、他們是用『皇道精神』動員百姓永遠當炮灰。</p>
<p>以上都是侵略者的精神動員，其眞正的目的在求精神的枯寂，靈魂的幻滅，而一任法西斯蒂頭腦去宰割，個個都像木乃伊，聽他們擺佈，送死。</p>
<p>被壓迫民族的精神動員完全不同。它是反侵略的，向上的，積極的和煥發的情神勁員。而决不是倒退的，消極的和萎縮的精神「不動員」。</p>
<p>什麼是今天中國國民精神總動員的旗子？是三民主義、是「外則爲獨立自由平等，內則爲民有民治民享一而奮鬥的三民主義—</p>
<p>現在，我們是全世界反侵略的主柱。我們的精神動員應具有全世界反侵略先鋒的一切特點：</p>
<p>第一，是武裝反抗侵略到底，决不中途妥協。所以我們的精神動員繼領現定：「軍事第一，勝利第一！」規定「在此時期應無所謂個人得失個人利害，與個人之屈伸與榮辱榮惟求得軍事之勝利乃爲吾國國民人人共享之光榮，惟不得獲得勝利爲人人最大之恥辱』。關於這，我們首先要打擊汪精衛及其流亞的賣國求和的主張和思想。</p>
<p>第二，實行全民動員，完成現代革命戰爭。所以動員綱領規定：『現代戰爭爲全民動員之戰爭，故不僅應動員國內一切之物資與人力。亦必動員全國國民之精神。』規定「集結全國國民之精神於簡單共同之目標，使全國民對自身皆確立同一的救國道德，對國家皆堅定同一的建國信仰，而國民皆記根據同一的道德觀念爲同一的信仰而奮鬥犧牲。』關於這，我們首先要反對，約束民衆動員的個別主張和行動。</p>
<p>第三，貫澈民主精神，固鞏團結統一。關於民主，綱領規定『戰時國民政治意識之普及』，『加速培養眞正之民權』（按中山先生規定眞正民權爲直接民權，卽除選舉權外，還有創制權，覆决權，　免權）。規定我們要『首求國民精神之充實』，「使其蓬勃煥發，堅張貞固有克服環境，柢抗　難之力量」。關于團結，綱領規定有「國家至上，民族至上」，有『意志集中，力量集中』，規定『國內各民族携手共肩抗×之事業，更足以增進整個民族之團結』，我們要求一精神之集中』，卽『求其密合團結，萬衆一心，衆志成城，以達于休戚利害絕對相共，及永不離散之境地』，關於這，首先要打擊一切挑撥離問反對民主的言論與行動。</p>
<p>有此三者，我們的精神總動員就成爲向上的，積極的和煥發的反侵略動員。這種動員不但爲今日中國對日抗戰所必需，而且爲全世界愛好和平的國家和民族反抗侵略的瘋狗所必行。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>從廿八年六月四日至十日</p>
<p>由於英國政府之繼續眷戀妥協政策，由於反侵略陣線之發端的英蘇談判擱淺，這一週，侵略者是更加瘋狂活躍起來了：</p>
<p>在西文，德意兩大侵略魔王，一週來大爲蠢動，北起波羅的海，南至菲洲北部，東至紅海以東的叙利亞，到處飛騰着侵略者的毒　。</p>
<p>在東方，日本侵略者爲了掩飾牠侵華軍事的失敗，爲了帮助政治進攻的部暑，採取了更無恥也更兇橫的反英運動，挑起了天津事件，燃放了逐出英美法各國在遠東勢力的戰火。</p>
<p>隨着國際形勢的嚴重，我國抗戰中的力量有了更大的進步，在湘鄂間，制止了×軍的進攻，在晉西南，更予×人以重大打擊，殲×又在一萬以上，此外魯蘇皖浙以至華南，都有捷報傳來，在軍事確已日益接近勝利階段了。</p>
<p>（一）英國政府委曲求全德意××四處放火</p>
<p>我們在上週就已指出英國金融資本家統治者，繼續採取妥協退讓政策，而且這種政策必將加深英法以至其他民主和平國家的危機，到了本週，情勢更加明顯了。</p>
<p>六月八日午後，英外相哈立法克斯發表外交演說，闈明英政府外交政策。主要還在委曲求全，以與侵略者實行妥協。他說：『各國獨立，偽爲國際所尊重，則英國不獨願就經濟上與德國及歐洲其他國家會同加以檢討，抑且極願爲之。』九日晚，英首相張伯倫又說：『英國現仍準備以會議方式，討論德國或任何國家的要求，……不能採取武力。』</p>
<p>對於已經侵入家內的强盜說：……不要用武！…要什麼，大家來談判！』你想，這有阻止强盜的可能嗎？</p>
<p>果然，德意侵略者看破英政府的左右爲難，這幾天竟變本加厲的猖狂起來了！十一日路透社柏林電，德國又在東西邊境，進行軍事佈置，堆築『防禦』工事，特別配備新式重軍器。十日中央社匈京電，德國黨政要人絡繹赴匈，企圖强化德匈關係。而十五日路透社紐約電，更傳出德軍二十五萬集中斯洛伐克北部沿波蘭邊象的消息了！德國完全併吞捷克斯洛伐克，摩拉維亞及波西米亞，又將成爲事實。而意國侵略者則正在準備大西洋大演習，企圖實行對英大示威。他們是這樣的四出然放大戰的火燄！</p>
<p>（二）日×封鎖天津租界太平洋上風雲險惡</p>
<p>至於日本侵略者，自然和德意一樣，其且變本加厲的向反候略陣綫最弱之一環的英國進攻了。</p>
<p>六月十四日起，日×實行封鎖天津英法租界，要挾英法當局，接受其無琊要求。日×指英方（一）包庇反日份子及共產黨（二）擁護中國法幣，阻碍聯合銀行偽幣之流通（三）提高物價（四）准許使用未經註冊之無線電（五）准許界內學校採用反日敎科書。日方宣稱：『倘英國不改變其政策，又不承認華北新形勢，以與日本合作，建設東亞新秩序，則日本將不能撤銷封鎖。』而在封鎖天津英法租界前後，如毆殺英國僑民，如擴大反英宣傳，如以「收買兇徒實行謀刺』恫嚇英國駐華大使，積種暴行，都是一般人士所不能想像的！</p>
<p>日×此種反英暴行，事實上由於侵華軍事遭遇嚴重的因難，由於政治進攻未能獲得多大發展，因此想用此種暴行，威嚇英國放棄反侵略政策，放棄支持中國抗戰的政策，轉而與日×談判妥協壓迫中國屈服。如果此一企圖不遂，日×也想以此種暴行，逐步刦奪英法各國在華權益，逐出英法各國在華勢力，加强佔領地區的統治，解救其目前困難，準備新的進攻。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以斷言，如果日×此種反英暴行再不遭遇痛擊，則太平洋上的腥風血雨，就會無情的來襲！誠如我國王寵惠外長在十四日所說：『假定謂接納日本要求，卽可使此種對於中國及第三國之任意侵犯之兇勢，可獰解决，實屬錯誤。蓋此遠東侵略者，現正等待時機，以完全關閉中國門戶，並驅出西方之勢力於亞洲以外也，但如列強對此再能堅持，各國果能採取集體行動，停止　買貨物及一切供給，則日方的投機，終必失敗。』</p>
<p>（三）妥協政策舉世共斥和平陣線又進一步</p>
<p>在日德意近來此種變本加厲的冒險攻勢之下，妥協退議政策，就遭受一切愛好和平與正義人士的反對。這種反對的怒潮，首先在遭受損害獨多的英國人民中問高漲起來。十日路透社倫敦電卽稱：『首相張伯倫及外相哈立法克斯最近演說所用之妥協語調，不獨爲反對派所不悅、卽若于擁護政府之人士，亦感不歡。』其次，法國方面更激烈反對英國妥協政策的復活，倫教每日電訊報巴黎訪昌報告，卽稱法人咸認「德政府仍堅信英國不願作戰，此點事實及首相張伯倫與外相哈立法克斯之演說，實爲目前嚴重的政局之最大危機』！</p>
<p>一面反對妥協政策，一面就是推進反侵略的和平陣綫運動。英前外相艾登卽於十日向保黨黨家　　　演講，他說：「英國現已决定組織和平陣　　　實　義無反顧！』他又提出警告：「一切非侵略國家，不問其政體如何，均應包括在和平陣綫之內，否則，實爲最不智之舉！……吾人雖不喜紙共產主議，惟蘇聯之爲非侵略國家，且爲非擴充領士主綫者，圖不應否</p>
<p>這種促進英國與蘇聯美法各國聯合反抗侵略國家的運動，自從天津事件發生以後，更加通於英法各國。如十二日英國貴族院會議，卽已一致主張政府應强硬對日，與美法取聯合步驟，並加强對中國援助。而英美法有關問題，英均與美法各國保持密切聯絡。』</p>
<p>事實上，自天津事件後一週以來，英美法觀度尚能一致反對日×暴行，英法駐遠東軍事當局，業已啟程前赴新加坡舉行軍事會議，美國太平洋艦隊大　習現在繼續舉行，而蘇聯太平洋海軍大演習亦有相繼開始的消息，對於英蘇談判，英國特使史德隆已到莫斯科，與蘇聯外交當避有所接洽，雖然英國新方案依　沒有多大變更，因此距離成功之期尙遠，但在國際國內形勢威逼之下，英國政府終會改變其政策的！</p>
<p>（四）西北前綫再獲大勝湘粵情勢無須顧慮</p>
<p>一週來的抗日戰爭，湘北山東專南各地均有激戰，但是重心則仍在晉西晉南。上週以來，×寇　其　力，推進所謂晉魯兩省掃蕩戰。但經我堅强反擊，不僅一籌莫展，而且損兵折將，大敗而囘。又如在晉南方面，×自上週起分兵九路，實行第八次進　中條山，但又中我運動戰妙計，我於九日開始反攻，十日克茅津渡，十一日克平陸，十二日克大臣，數日之間，斃××一萬餘名，佔其全數三分之一以上，斬獲之衆，創造本年來華北各地戰果的新紀錄。在晉西」帶，×曾由中陽離石分兵兩路進犯，但北路×軍旣無寸進，南路又遭計誘反擊，我於十日克柳林，十一日克土門，並一度攻入汾城，斃×總數至少在一千五百以上！在山東，×自上週起分數路向蒙陰沂水莒　一帶進犯，聲勢似乎十分兇惡，但我軍利用泰山之山脉地形，與×肉搏，斬殺之衆，爲近月所未見，僅計　陰一役，卽已斃×二千以上。目前山東各路又入　　　　，此外湘鄂方面，繼續穩定，粵境西北江亦甚　寂，　江增城從化一分帶三路犯福和共和等地，但　　　　。綜合全部戰况，確已日益接近勝利階段。日奉×軍雖又有大舉進攻的消息，湘北和潮汕均較吃緊，但事實上可無多大顧慮。我們所不能不特別指出的，但是汪精衛等的行動、因爲日×侵華軍事已達嚴重困難、近來就積極進行政治的進攻，而以軍專及對英嚇詐為糖，這種政治進攻，主要在于分化我抗日陣綫的團結，破壞我國與英美法蘇各友邦的合作，和加强佔領地區的統治，刦取我國廣大的人力與物力，以解救其困　，而凡此一切，汪精衛等及變相汪系的「理論」與活動，使直接問接的爲日×所利用。因此，我們在國府緝汪明令之後，更應以加緊和汪逆組織偽中央等行動鬥爭，加緊和汪逆及其他動搖份子頑固份子的　　『言論，作無情的鬥爭。</p>

<p>【中央社重慶十七日電】天津外訊、日方雖已取消　行示威之舉、但英租界之情形、仍極嚴重、據某有地位之英僑談，各英僑鑒於形勢之嚴重、又深慮天津事件將成爲日本在政治上經濟上統治華北能否成功之試　品、故均團結一致、共同應付云云、天津泰晤士報社論稱、天津事件巳不能認爲地方事件、故第一點須承認此點、始能應付裕如云、</p>

<p>第三日情形</p>
<p>【中央社重慶十七日電】天津外訊、昨爲日方封鎖租界之第三日、其封鎖之措置，已更加嚴密，對華籍居民尤甚、獲准進出租界之華籍居民、爲數極少、昨日一日間、所發生之重要事件。約爲（一）華籍小販二人、因由日軍設置障碍物處、携菜　遞送蔬菜至租界。致被日軍逮捕擊斃、（二）反英煽動者之活動、更趨積極、</p>

<h3>本報特約通信　羅浮行（四）</h3>
<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>舊的火灰·新的血跡</p>
<p>長寧　也和龍華一樣，幾十間店戶的市鎮境個精光，所差的是時間不同。長寧是當去年博羅一失陷就被法西斯「文明火」燒掉的，焦燥的氣味，沒有龍華那般濃冽。</p>
<p>我們到了長寧，就在　北面而說離了灰炭的市街　幾間屋子弄早　吃，這幾所屋子除了二間還做看茶樓生意外，就是一間作為鄕公所辦事處，二間是駐滿了士兵。</p>
<p>假如羅浮山的面是南向——羅浮之陽是長寧，不，長寧是在羅浮的懷抱中，最接近山麗，到市背後去望一望羅浮真面目，什麼沖　觀，華首台·黃龍觀，都顯現在眼前。</p>
<p>吃一餐飯，×機來盤旋了二次。所有的軍民都非常鎭定，茶樓　的茶客沒有一位逃避出去。</p>
<p>這與其說是吃早飯，不如說是午餐，因爲飯後已十二時了，我們就從小路一溜烟跑往福田，途中得到一些如下的軍事消息：「××支隊昨晚轉進經九潭達新作塘。××營也同樣到了瀾石」。有些同志很焦慮，以爲前綫沒有我們的軍隊，可是到距福田五里的地方，陳團長已派幾位弟兄來迎接我們，並告訴我們團部的所在地，要帶同我們到團部去休息和住宿，又告訴我們方才×機轟炸福田的事情，那位弟兄指手劃脚，指給我們那些落彈的山林，他每句話每一動作都顯示着憤怒與機警。接着有六位士兵拾着二位老百姓，一位武裝同志和我們碰頭，那就是給侵略者炸傷的人，滿身是血，沿途商滿了血迹，血，在這裏益顯得光榮和偉大。</p>
<p>我們以陳圑長的盛情難却，就把慰勞品給挑到荔枝墩，分配一部份同志也到荔枝墩去，選了幾位代表去團部會陳團長。陳團長是一位少年軍官。有魁梧的身體，爽直的談吐，他是陳伯南的侄兒，堪稱將門之子。我們略寒喧後，就决定晚上來舉行一個有意義的軍民聯歡會。</p>
<h3>中央紀念週席上　何應欽報告軍事　就戰役兵員證明抗戰必勝　就開發建國必成</h3>
<p>【中央社重　通訊】中央黨部十二日舉行　理紀念週、何委員應欽講演。原辭如下、主席各位同志、南昌會戰以後、我軍爲繼續消耗×人、使其毫無休息整理的餘暇起見、在四月一個月內、各戰區部隊，均向　當面的×人不斷的出擊、各淪陷地區的游擊部隊，也與正規軍互相呼應、在×人後方、加緊　擊、破壞與擾亂、均能予×軍以制命的打擊、尤其如南昌高安武寧之反攻、如粵賓東江北江西江方面之反攻、如開封安慶方面之奇襲、使×軍　於奔命、應付不這、精銳銷亡、損耗極大、而其西進的企圖、遂爲我粉碎無遺、總計四月一個月、我軍所獲戰果、僅就有書面報告、可以統計者，路如下　、（一）作戰次數八二七、（二）斃×五三八四六、（三）俘×偽軍一〇六八、（四）俘馬匹七七四、（五）獲步槍二〇一三。（六）獲機槍九九、（七）獲砲二五。（八）擊毀及奪　　甲車輛一七一、（九）獲彈藥六八九三四、（十）擊恊艦艇一一、（十一）　燬×機一二、（十二）破壞公路一〇四公里、（十三）破壞鐵道九〇公里、（十四）克復城鎭三七八七、</p>
<p>「五月攻勢」、這是×預定向我攻擊的時期、故五月一個月內、各戰區的戰况、都較以前激烈、尤以豫南鄂北一役、×以三個步兵師團、一個騎兵放團的兵力、欲圖尋在該方面之我軍主力一舉園殲、而且事先就大事廣播宣傳、謂我軍若干師、已陷其包圍綫內、不日卽可殲滅云云、不意遭我軍猛力抵抗、迎頭痛擊、新野、唐河、棗陽、隨縣、先後爲我克服、×因腹背受我包圍、不得不匆匆向安陸、京山、錘祥、一帶潰退、此役斃×在萬人以上、俘獲甚多、</p>
<p>棄于戰場的的屍及×傷兵纍纍、均無法掩埋救護、其狼狽不堪的情形、可以想見、綜計這一個月各方面所獲的戰果如下、（一）作戰次數八三八、（二）斃×五一八九一、（三）俘×偽軍四八六、（四）斃馬匹八三六、（五）獲步槍一五八七、（六）獲機槍一八三、（七）獲砲一三、（八）轟毀及俘獲裝申車輛二七二、（九）獲彈藥六七七四八、（十）　傷艦艇一八、（十一）擊燬×機二四、（十二）破壞公路一〇七公里、鐵路三六公里、</p>
<p>就這最近兩個月的戰事情形來說，我們可以看出（一）×軍攻擊的精神、已較從前衰弱、（二）×軍如離開交通綫路、則運動與補給、均感困難、（三）兵員消耗太大、補充不易、（自二十六年七月七日起、至本年五月上半月止、×軍傷亡人數共爲八十六萬四千五百餘人）、（四）此次侵華戰事、師出無名、且以勞師遠出、久而無功、官兵厭戰反戰思想、日益濃厚、（五）兩年以來戰費支出過鉅，現金消耗殆盡，公債無法消化，經濟崩潰、資源匱乏，其本國人民深感生活壓迫的痛舌、　戰反戰的思想亦日見濃厚，並已屢有行動的表現，基此種種原因，我們知道×人對於目前戰事，殆已感覺無法應付，速戰速决旣不可能、速和速决亦辦不到、反觀我國抗戰兩年以來、軍隊的質與量、均屬愈戰愈强、每經一次會戰軍隊便加一次整理、舉凡械彈、裝具粮秣、交通、通訊、衛生等項、一切都是按照實戰的要求、而加以充實改進、其在敎育方面、各軍事學校、以及各種臨時訓練班隊中、也無不加緊訓練、以期各級健全幹部的大量養成、</p>
<p>至於兵員補充的問題、也是一天一天在想法改進、現各軍管區、除應徵兵額源源徵集外、各地壯丁且多自願提前入伍者、足見全國民衆、對於國家民挨的觀念日益加强、同仇敵愾的心理、日益加深、這不能不歸功本黨同志、以及各級政府、與全國辦理兵役人員的努力與宣傳、然後纔能收穫這樣的效果、</p>
<p>自第二期戰事開始以後、我各路游擊部隊、均能發揮力量、在×後頻頻襲擊、輔助正規軍作戰、以收分散、牽制、擾亂、疲敝×人的效果、數月以來、、蘇、冀、察×軍、深感威脅、曾集結數師團的兵力、以圖掃蕩我游擊部隊、但其結果、徒勞兵力、毫無所獲、反予我軍以分散殲×的機會、今後祇要我正規軍與游擊部隊、能够切實配合、協同動作、隨時　地、不斷予×人以打擊、使其在我淪陷區內經濟的搜括與取、無由達到目的，而我全黨同志、全國同胞、更能在本黨及政府統一國策之下、一致努力於生產建設工作、使一切戰時物質、均能自給自足、逐漸辦到不必仰給於外人的地步、則戰事愈持久、×人的崩潰愈迅速、抗戰最後勝利之日、亦卽建國成功之時、在今年第五屆第五次中央全會開幕的時候、總裁曾經告訴我們說、「我們的前途、誠然還不免有很多的困難、但抗戰進入了第二期以後、我們確信戰局必然是一天一天順利、一天一天接近光明，問題全在我們有沒有不屈不撓，長期持久的精神、有沒有舉國一致愈戰愈奮的努力，總裁又說，『我們認爲抗戰建國的工作，是沒有時限可定的，五年不成則十年，十年不成則百年，一天不達到目的，我們就一天不停息』，同志們，我們大家遵從總裁的訓言，一致向著勝利與成功的光明途程，努力邁進，</p>
<p>最後還有一點、近來×機時常飛到後方來育目的轟炸、這是表明×人在前線巳經沒有辦法，一方面想動搖我後方的人心、一方面想破壞我後方的建設、但是適得其反、我全國民衆在×人恐怖屠殺的政策下，祗有益堅其雪恥復仇的意念·益堅其爲國犧牲的决心·幷不因×人的矗炸、而稍有動搖、幷不因×人的破壞而停止建設的工作、這一點、是抗戰以來我們全國同胞心理上一種大大的進步、是出乎×人意料之外的、我們要永還保持這種進步、抗戰到底、以達利最後最大勝利的目的、（中央社）</p>

<h3>戰雲下的汕頭市</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者白韋</p>
<p>嗚嗚的幾聲汽笛，便給新海門輪載着離開了香港、向着汕頭的航程前進、</p>
<p>出了鯉魚門，海的波濤無邊無際的洶湧着，銀雪般的浪花，在一次一次　激中爆出，又在一次一次下降中消失了，這是太平洋上的浪花、無形中刻劃出這憫太平洋的縮影，我們覺得每一次的浪花雖然都撲到我們的船來，都影響到我們的船顚簸不定；但，只要我們堅定着童志與信心，始終會衝通了海湧的波濤·或許有的波濤更是我們的船的推進助力·從航海去體驗太平洋上的國際風雲，對於中國的自力更生的抗戰，眞够令人樂觀了。</p>
<p>時將子夜，風雨大作。虎虎的　聲夾着沙沙的雨聲像馬嘶一機，打在船上發出奇響，記者默計航程，大約已在東江的沿海了。東江，正是記者　離開了的工作地帶，又是完美的家的所在。在那裏曾看見過×人踐踏後的血跡，曾看見過×人殘酷的行爲，更曾看見過千萬的忠勇游擊隊員和民衆鬥爭的英姿。記者滿希望從玻璃憲中望到東江　曲的海岸。可是早給　黑的夜幕遮蔽住了，徒然引起一絲絲的鄕然和別恨而已。不過嶺東和東江的安危，是同着命運的；不，整個的中國也是同若命運的。到了今天，鄕土和家族的觀念，應廣泛地去定範圍吧！</p>
<p>十一日下午四時自港啓程，翌晨八時抵汕，航程足十六小時。本來這條統線是×人海軍宣稱加以普通封鎖的，幸而　次沒有遭受×艦的檢查騷　，只將迫進汕頭海口時，在　色迷濛中約路見一兩隻戰艦的影子，據說是×艦。其實以中國海　的延長，企圖嚴密封鎖，簡直是×人海軍的夢想，何况在目前遠東綜雜　境中還包含有國際權益問　？看看這次×人封鎖浙閩等九口的未來成績，可以做一個最幾白的實　。</p>
<p>進入汕頭港內，　望海面。滿眼都是英國船舶，太古，渣華，德忌利士的商船十餘艘結隊一般的排列着，旁邊還有三兩艘小型的英國砲艦，從這再可以看出英國遠東的航業在華的權益了。在船上和水手們閒談下，知道了×我戰事發生；貨運滅少一半，這次九口封鎖，更爲零落不　，同時×人飛　的炸彈，戰艦的炮口，並不因大英帝　旗的標誌而轉了向，仍不斷的投往，（指往船上）。爲解决英國遠東航業的厄運，恐非區區三兩隻炮艦護航所能奏功，應從根本去推求如何壓抑侵略，安定遠東局面。　（未完）</p>
<p>小評</p>
<h3>五十萬封慰勞信</h3>
<p>最近軍委會政治部，中央宣傳部，中央社會部，重慶市黨部及全國慰勞總會等五個機關。聯合發動在六月三十日前徵集慰勞信五十萬封，分發前線各將士。這是一個極有意義的運動，一面可以鼓勵前方將士，多牧勝利的戰果，一面又可促發我們一般人民對於前線將士的敬意，提高我們擁譁持久抗戰爭取最後勝利的情緒。</p>
<p>從我們廣大的後方和僑胞大衆的人數來看，區區五十萬封慰勞信，徵募結果，一定可以超過預期。卽以本港而論，同胞人數，何止一百餘萬？憂國難之心，誰甘自外？慰勞之舉，宜各爭先！何况祇是一舉筆之勞？生活書店，奉命代收此項信件、願各界士女，勿失最後三天的機會！</p>
<h3>祝中華義學開學</h3>
<p>港九兩區中華義學，已定期今日下午一時開學，由各　分別舉行開學禮。我們對此，謹致民族的祝望之意。</p>
<p>中華義學是粵省賑濟會爲救濟失學難童與失業敎師而設，　名思義，我們深盼主事諸君，隨時隨處，須以爲中華民族保存元氣，及培育優秀新生力量，以備將來爲國家民族之生存獨立而努力爲主。且今日先生同學，相處一堂，自顧此數千砲火憂患除生，尤當永勿忘我們國家民埃的巨恥與大仇，昔者越王勾殘，領導越民，十年生聚，十年敎訓、卒以沼吳。我願諸君，更勿稍存苟且，效法先賢，以爲民族爭光！</p>
<p>再者，此次港九澳三區登記學生共有六千餘人，而目前港九兩區校舍僅能收容四千餘人，此外失業敎師之未能錄用者，亦居相當多數。我們一面盼望各校慷慨協助借給校舍，一面祈望主持此種工作者，能够繼續努力，並認眞擢取眞實人才。</p>

<h3>標準丈夫測驗</h3>
<p>你是一個標準丈夫嗎？</p>
<p>昨天，向太太們介紹的標準妻子測驗：今天，再向先生們來介紹標準丈夫測驗。先生，你高興做一個標準丈夫嗎？現在有十個問題：請你用下面的計分表，來自己統計一下。</p>
<p>〇分……絕不　根本沒有那囘事　不幹</p>
<p>一分……偶然　難得　稍微一點兒</p>
<p>二分……平平　不一定　有時候</p>
<p>三分……常常　很多　多半</p>
<p>四分……完全　絕對的</p>
<p>人的偏見是一樣的，男人也不比女人差多少</p>
<p>所以爲求你的標準準確起見，請你自己計分一次之後，再請你的夫人，用客觀的態度，也來計一次分。然後把兩者加起來，徐個二，那結果，便是眞正的標準分數了。</p>
<p>四七分滿分：最好，那你是最十足的標準的丈夫了。一般的情形，在二十五分以上，都還算得上好丈夫，但如果在二十分以下，那就要請你留心點。</p>
<p>最後，附帶提一提，我們認爲，家庭是應當由兩個人公同平均負責的，如果雙方都能依照這個標準去做，達到一個互相相當的水準，那，家庭將永還是個天堂。</p>
<p>後面是十個測騐的題目：</p>
<p>一，你在事業上具有遠大的志氣；日常閱報讀書，力求改進自己嗎？</p>
<p>二，你善於利用職務與社交上的機會，與許多有益的朋友交遊嗎？</p>
<p>三，你很注意你的外表，總把自己穿得整整齊齊，乾乾凈凈嗎？</p>
<p>四，你能忍耐，遇到失利的事，不怪別人，不亂發脾氣嗎？</p>
<p>五，你把家庭裏的事務，經濟，完全交給你的妻子管理自己只在一旁鼓勵，而不吹毛求疵的干涉嗎？</p>
<p>六，你對你的妻子的家人興朋反，都能表示好感，而不批評嗎？</p>
<p>七，你不懷恨，不憂鬱，不賭錢，不飲過度之酒，不用過量之錢嗎？</p>
<p>八，你尊重你的妻子的自由，不堅持要她一天到晚躱在家里嗎？</p>
<p>九，你在公餘之暇，總歡喜家居；如果出鬥，也總儘可能地帶你的妻子同行嗎？</p>
<p>十，你常常歡喜請客人來家里消磨；但在事前，總先徵得你的妻子的同意嗎？</p>

<h3>海上風雲　六</h3>
<p>— 勞頓上尉著　楊璧譯</p>
<p>前文摘述</p>
<p>一九一四年，歐局已緊張時，美航輪『凱隆柏齊號』，載着六百萬金條，自紐約到德國去，邱克斯　公司的無線電員傑克，與機械員比爾，也趁這船去遊歷歐洲。在船上他倆遇到法飛行家魯蒙加羅。和船上的德籍無線電員鮑佛。傑克在代飽工作時，接着個怪消息，說英德宣戰了，英軍艦要來截刦這隻船。傑克應了船長之請，也做了船上無線電員……</p>
<p>『你知道嗎？我們正在想逃出英國巡洋艦的虎口呢。』此爾南諾說得十分緊張，嚴重。</p>
<p>『船還沒有掉頭我就知道了。』傑克不動聲色說，『不過在那時候，因爲是非常機密，我連你都不會告訴；但是，現在已無須再瞞了。』他就將方才經過告訴了比爾，正談話間，進來了一個船員。</p>
<p>他告訴他們，無線電室的門要關好，　洞也要遮起來，不能　外面露出一絲一微的光，在黑暗裏，卽使有極小的一線光露出去，就會讓英國巡洋艦知道他們的行蹤了。船上的旅客們，也得到同樣的通知、侍役們到處忙着煌燈，用氈子遮蓋憲洞。到十點鐘的時候、除了二些工作部份——他們　謹愼的將燈光封閉在裏面——滿船上一點燈光都沒有了。</p>
<p>因爲，恐怕還有人不服從命令，船長吩咐將艙房一部分的電燈總機紐關斷了。這時候，在一黑如漆的甲板上，擠着一小堆，一小堆的胆小旅客，他們不放心去踵，都擠作一團的在低聲談議，時時向海面張望，看有沒有表示危險的棵海燈</p>
<p>在黑唔裏，這條大船並不用指路　，開足了馬力乘風破浪的向前飛進，守夜的人是比平時添加了一　之多，在架機上，船長　領着一批船員，徹夜不眠的守　着。</p>
<p>經這這樣長的時間，　克一　不接的坐在無綫電機前面，一直到業二天早晨，天空現了魚肚色，才由無綫電裏傳來一點聲音，打破了這死。英國　洋　「　莎號　在和「梭佛克號」通話，但是消息是用的密碼，傑克除了得到還兩個船名以外，一些也不能知道通話的內容。</p>
<p>在早餐的時間，旅客們一的憂懼，失眠，都面容憔悴的紫集在客　裏，船長說了幾旬安慰他們的話，但是，收效甚微。　個人都知道，這給正在無目的地狂奔，海洋上的警犬也正在四處搜尋，等　換上這件值得的俘獲物。</p>
<p>四　冰山</p>
<p>這天晚上，降着濃厚的霧。但是，這不能使這船減低狂奔的速力，不用燈火，甲板上和艙喜仍是漆黑的，她開足了馬力，在海面上　目的亂撞。旅客們，更感覺心神不安了，後來他們推出一個代表、去見船長，要求將速度減低、幷且，不要像這樣在黑暗中亂撞。</p>

<h3>女子籃球爭標戰　知行獲申報杯　四十比十八大敗中華　第一場西南小挫華雄</h3>
<p>（本報專訊）申報杯女子籃就，昨晚作爭標戰於靑年會健身　中、座上觀多、清清有衆、實行有錢出錢、有力出力之責任、難　拜賜誠不淺　、</p>
<p>第一戰西南對華雄、此兩隊在過去兩役、均遭收績、　標無望、然因實力相埒、競爭甚烈、西南僅以廿七比廿一小勝、</p>
<p>次埸為解決錦標之重要戰、觀客目標、亦咸集於此、惟事前多數未能預科中華竟一蹶不振、大敗於知行者也、</p>
<p>中華致敗原因、乃防衛不力、尤無一人能制阻陳榮棠之活動。故榮棠每得球到手、閃身卽過、乃以個人之力、得卅分之多、誡奇　也、</p>
<p>開賽後、知行卽一氣佔上風、榮棠迭有所獲，反視中華諸鋒受知行守將所阨、毫無進展、及後調劉守光上陣、亦無濟於事、蓋因先間　失已多、軍心大受影響、全局崩潰、雖欲挽救、已無能爲力矣、</p>
<p>知行則防籲有力、使中華諸鋒、在其制肘下、欲逞不得、雖以守光之矯捷、亦嘆術窮、故知行之勝、乃攻守咸宜所由致也、</p>
<p>全賽過程、俱知行得勢、榮棠尤活動、終上半場、已以廿五比五大勝、及後中華調容美葵守衛、防禦稍堅、因而前鋒於力戰之下、頗有起色、無奈上半場損失巳巨、囘天乏衛、終以十八比四十大敗、而申報杯亦爲知行所得也、雙方戰績如下、</p>

<h3>公開棒球賽　中華再勝香港會　今日上午有兩場舉行</h3>
<p>昨日下午二時三刻、全港公開棒球聯賽、中華隊以十比二再敗香港會、香港會深以明日抗戰氣燄萬丈之友碑隊、爲撙節氣力、特地改變原有陣勢、以慣充二壘之史蔑夫任投手、善捕之獲加任右翼、在首次兩局中、中華乘對方投手軟弱、守　鬆弛、先後輕取兩分，香港會不堪觀衆之諷判、急調囘羅蘭士任投手要職、</p>
<p>昨香港會全場受中華隊之强大威脅、祇有招架之功，而無反襲之力、在第二局、羅蘭士及奇力跑得之兩分、全歸功于希健士之三壘打、可惜曇花一現、繼後無人、祇獲兩記而逝、</p>
<p>第四局爲中華之幸遝局、陳連亮及胡國棟先後被黜、苟香港會嚴密一點，釘死第三位擊球員、卽可令中華攻勢瓦解，惟中華不以惡劣環境而稍餒，陳芳先得「一壘安打」、後又連偷兩壘、蔡炳芬乘摸頓漏接之便、佔個一壘、陳芬在紛亂中歸疊、先得一分、此後區炳南、黃榮俊、各得「二壘打」、魚貫得分、陳倫英及胡正渠、又得鍾燦森之「二壘打」、送返大本營、共得六分，威勢之盛、由此可見、最後胡國棟出場時、擊出之球、被二壘投一曇截殺、好夢始完、昨日巾華隊「差利」林業因病不能上場，否則表演更爲可觀、而得分亦不祇此數、</p>

<h3>高爾基的文學遺產</h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>——紀念高爾基逝世三週年</p>
<p>二九三六年的六月十八日。在莫斯科的天空上隕落了一顆近代世界人類最偉大的文學巨星，這就是那一位最卓越最澈底的民衆事業的門士——高爾基——他在數千年悠悠不倦的文學興革命的鬥爭之後，在他自己所親自參加親自促成了的新社會日漸向上的中間，然長逝，離開了　數十年來伴同戰鬥的人民大衆，離開了他自己所培養起來的文學後人，他歸返於最後的安息。一直到今天，這一位偉大的文學巨人是巳經不知不覺的逝去整整的三年了。</p>
<p>一個最勇敢最有力的戰士，一　最忠實最可靠的朋友之失去，對於全世界一切正在與黑暗和强暴作着頑强的苦鬥底入民，無疑地是一種極大的損失，這個損失，簡直可以說是無可補償的；然而每一個曾經在歷史的戰鬥上遺留下他的積極的功績的人，都是不會平白地死去的，在這個世界之上，他們芷遺留着無限的豐富的事業，遺留着無數的珍貴的遺產，足以便他們的生命延長至於無窮盡的歷歷史前方，高爾基，他正是這樣的一個人——而且甚至比較其他許多這樣遺留下歷史的功績的人更偉大，更光榮，他替我們的世界創造了無數新的文學成果，遺留下許多珍貴的文學遺產。他底數十年來賡續不斷的文學的鬥爭，不僅在他的生前領導着羣衆，而且在他的死後，也以最燦目的光芒燭照着暗黑中的人類。</p>
<p>高爾基的文學遺產，是異常地龐大的，貫澈在他的文學創作文學鬥爭的全生涯中，是一些最廣博最多方面的戰門，他不僅是小說家，而且又是政論家，理論家，散文家，詩人，記者，編輯，他不僅是現實主義者，而且又是革命的浪　主義者，他底寫作的範圍是如何地複雜，他所描摹的典型是如何地豐富，所有這些，都是古往今來許多興高兩基齊名的文學家之所未能企及的，他底這些博大的多方面的文學遺產之遺留給我們，無疑地可以算得是我們近代的人類底最偉大的光榮之一，我們，從他那博大的文學遺產之中，是應該用怎樣的方法，怎樣的態度，攝取一些怎樣的東西呢？</p>
<p>這裏，我們很可以看一看蘇聯「文學新聞」紀念高爾基的辭句：</p>
<p>——高爾基的文學，是我們的文學所不可不攝取的貴重的創作經驗之無窮盡的富藏。卽使再經過幾百年之後。作家們還必須從他的作品之中學習種種的東西。卽如他底　術的大來性，用語的準確明快和簡潔，在讀者心裏引起真學的激情之力量。洞察人物內心機構之敏銳的才能……，都是值得我們去學晉的、無諭如何，高爾基是一所偉大的學校，他在生前已經養成了許多的大藝術家，此後，還有更多的作家將要從他的引導之中產生吧！</p>
<p>當然，攝取高萬基的文學遺產是需要從他的藝術的大衆性，用語，才能等各方面去着手的，這一　，蘇騙「文學新聞」的話並沒有錯但這樣的實見，都未免是不完全的，不藝力的，它還不能把握到一個最中心的要點，我們知這在高爾基的廳大的文學這　之中。正包含着無數的方面，無數的特點，每一方面，每一特點的把握攝取，在我們雖然是必要的，但却不是中心的，我們固然必須在各枝各節上學習高爾基、但都不能單單滿足於枝節的學習，我們要從整個上。從統一上，去完全地接受高爾基遺留給我們的遺產。所請接受文學遺產。不舉艇是一個技術上的間題，需且是整個文學創作方法與藝術實綫的問題，我們今日楚要從高面基這偉大的文學　人之中。學習他在他那一時代的　形勢下怎樣以他的精神活動與現實實踐相聯系，從他底創作活動與歷史進行的配合中間，學習他的經驗，技巧，手法與理論，藉以積蓄我們自身的藝術認識的方法，只有這樣地從整個上丟理解高爾基的文學遺產，我們才能有機的向他攝取一切，吸收一切。</p>
<p>蘇聯新進的一位理論家格俄爾克。魯略茲對於攝取高爾基的文學遺產，有過一段很好的意見，雖然他不會明確的指出攝取高爾基文學這產之基本的中心所在，但是也不失爲一個較爲具體明瞭的意見，他說：</p>
<p>——學習高爾基，决不是一件容易的事情，模倣頹廢派的藝術家或是象徽派的詩人，那倒比較容易得多，因爲，學習高爾基的事，不單是文學上的問題（按：意指文學技術——潔孺），主要的是我們必須從高爾基學習他對於生活的熊度，他喜歡甚麼？爲甚麼喜歡？憎惡甚麼？爲甚憎惡？這些是我們不可不知的，他的世界觀是怎樣形成的？不可不知道；普羅列塔利亞運動和普羅列塔利亞人道主義與現實主義　　的緊密的關係，不可不知這；爲了從他的文學的敎養取得有益的敎訓，首先對於他的生活的最高敎養不可不知道。</p>
<p>必須從整個上來接受高萬基底博大文學遺產才是我們今日紀念高爾基的中心工作，而這一項工作，不僅在蘇聯國內具有超卓的意義，就是在世界上其他的國家，首先如戰鬥中的中國，這一項工作也是有着絕頂重大的意義的，爲了創造我們民族革命的文學，爲了更有力的使用我們文學戰鬥的武器，我們都需要從接受高爾基的遺產之中，來豐富自己，强化自己！</p>
<h3>麻城鄉村的訪問</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記——</p>
<p>一到了戰地，什麼都不能預定，我們原想在宋埠留宿一宵，便往潢川訪問李宗仁將軍，順道考察一下豫鄂邊境的民衆動員工作。因爲戰事進入了第二階段，展開在前面的鬥爭，不是陣地戰，而爲山岳戰；也就是說，在戰略上必須轉變到廣大的流動戰，以期得收持久良好戰果，豫皖鄂三省邊境爲流動網的重要根據地；蜿蜓起伏的大別山脈，從平靖關東走，一直伸入了安徽，跟皖山脈手拉手似的接聯着，而環峙於西部的大洪山脈，尤其是鄂北的主要戰場。然而在陳參議的卡車辦到以後，事情又發生了變化；原因是，我們一羣中的吳小姐，忽然接到北大舊同學從武昌寄來的快信說，馮治安將軍卽日要到麻城，而且有一部份隊伍候令開入皖西，政訓處需要人帮忙，可以去跟他會見。</p>
<p>「那麼，我們先往麻城，行吧？」吳小姐徵求着大家的同意。</p>
<p>經過相當時間的考慮，才始决定下來，在高熱度的陽光底下，爬上了卡車；路面非常窄狹，非常崎嶇，所以顚簸得特別厲害，雖則短短幾十里路程，連心臟也有點震動了。</p>
<p>提到麻城，不由你不記起過去的故事：這座遙望皖西的古城，在一九三一年的秋天，就是向「赤區」進擊的營壘，城外四郊的高地，還遺留着不少碉堡，當時「赤區」的中心點建立於金家寨，現在已經改爲立煌縣治，而且負起了流動戰的重大使命。大別山脈的一支鐵流，自然會泛濫起來，咆哮起來，跟「赤區」時代同樣的發揮它的威力，如果歷史可爲前例的話。</p>
<p>費了一小時的功夫，把司令部找到了，但不幸得很，馮將軍還沒有到，政訓處也不在這裏，乘興而來，却撲了一空，便臨時變更計劃，作附近鄉村的訪問，由聯保處的介紹，連續訪問了七個鄉村。</p>
<p>「我們爲什麼要發動自衛戰爭，」</p>
<p>「爭獨立，爭自由，爭生存！」</p>
<p>「如果我們的軍隊退出了武漢，你們怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>「打流動戰。」</p>
<p>『你們沒有傢伙，怎樣打得起來？」</p>
<p>「有，有，有他們會送上的！不，耕頭釘粑也打得來，袛要大家不怕死！』</p>
<p>這是民衆抗戰意識的測騐，同時，卽爲潛伏着的偉大力量。他們認識的正確，情緒的熱烈，團結的堅强，不能不使人詫爲奇蹟，而衷心地佩服起來。</p>
<p>「誰說勝利不屬於我們呢？」吳小姐在訪問後所下的結論。</p>
<h3>從成都到西安</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>五、寧　一宿</p>
<p>置兩首，是把四川公路的路政，批判得痛快淋漓了。</p>
<p>這些時，技巧常然談不上，但都是老百姓身受　種民間疾苦，積年累月，凝成濃烈的感情，由迷感情之不可壓制的奔放，而自然吐露出來的心昔。對于它們，在同是老百姓的我們看來，固頗感興趣；卽如在上者，也是不應該抹煞他們的呼喊，筆者選綠之意，蓋在此焉。</p>
<p>六：民族英雄的睡眠</p>
<p>昨天在途中看到的那一團開赴前綫的軍隊，傍晚七時許，也趕到寧羌了。他們分住于各旅店，我住的寧康旅社也運走廊都給住滿了。（未完）</p>
<h3>高爾基三年忌</h3>
<p>— 文兪</p>
<p>「世上再沒有一種東西比時鐘更爲無情：在你出生的時候，當你正熱情地採集着你那靑春的幻夢的花朶時，牠始終平勻地擺動着。一個人出生之後，牠就一天比一天地接近死亡，當你作垂死的呻吟時，牠仍然沉靜地冷酷地計算你的每一秒時間。」（鐘——高爾基）</p>
<p>詛咒這沉靜而冷酷的時間！它，把偉大的文學導師，戰士，被壓迫者的靈魂，高爾基，帶走了，他逝去了，使他不能看到五萬萬人的戰鬥，聽不到奴隸枷鎖的碰響聲和碎裂聲；要不然，他當然是莊嚴地凌厲地戰鬥，和我們一同戰鬥！</p>
<p>三年了！今天，是一九三九年穴月十八日，時問確是沉靜和冷酷，然而，過去的是應該過去的，永生的將超越時聞而、永在——那，就是，永在高爾基的文學事業，戰鬥實踐，不　的勞作，在這些發着光芒的東西面前，時間是戰敗了！</p>
<p>三年了，在這　麼嚴肅的年代，在火和血映紅了我們祖國的今天，我們向文學巨人，不倦的戰士，學習！</p>
<p>『一切的人都同樣的不幸，面最不幸的却是那些把他們的不幸作爲飾物的人們。這些人比一切的人都渴求別人的照佛　同時，亦最不配享有　人的照拂。奮鬥！！這是生活的目的，讓生活除奮門外再沒有別的——那麼，時間將是最寶貴的，最美麗的。」（鐘——高爾基）</p>
<p>不幸。那是多聲慣當？奮鬥，那是多麼美麗？到光明之途去的，到眞理之彼岸行進的，人將戰勝時問，戰勝死！高爾基，四十年的文學生活，革命實踐，他爭得了人羣的曙光，眞理的勝利，他的奮鬥，韌鬥，是被壓迫的人羣，在戰門中的今日，要學習的。</p>
<p>高爾基，是平民的歌手，戰鬥的號　。古老的俄羅斯刺死在他的筆端，布爾喬亞顫抖着，革命的叛徒終於用毒計把他脅死，而他的成就就是在于學習，革命的實踐，和一切被壓迫的人羣緊連在一起。</p>
<p>「請看書罷、——這知識的　　下只有知識才有救人的能力，只有他可以使我們在精神上成爲强壯的，忠誠的，有意識的人，這樣的人，方才能够忠似地愛着人類，尊崇他的工作，衷心地注意到他那不會中止的偉大工作的極美麗的結果。（我怎樣學習的——高爾基）</p>
<p>他是多麼重視學習，讀美書本？他在生活中有更好的學習。無怪他的學問是如此的廣博，無怪他所留下的遺產是如此的豐富了。可是我們該看出，他的學習，是爲了「忠誠地愛人頹」，爲了人類解放的「偉大工作」。大胆地說一句，沒有高爾基的英勇堅决的革命實踐，也就不能有他的革命文學，和生活沒有密切連繁的學識是空洞的，沒有鬥爭的生活却又是死寂的。所以，從高爾基的門爭生活和革命實嚴上去理解他的知識，他的文學的偉大，才能算是眞的理解。把高爾基的文學事業和他的革命實踐分離開來，便是對這位巨人的侮辱！</p>
<p>高爾基畢生勞作，爲了創造十月之路，而革命的豐碑已經高聲的時候，六分之五的土地裏還是黑漆樣的，因此，他繼續不斷的戰鬥，爲了黑暗中痛苦的人類！他和一切被壓迫的人羣連結在一起，他揮動戰二旗還不稍懈，</p>
<p>他在蘇聯作家代表大會（一九三四）中這樣號召，反法西主義的進軍，爲了反對「榨取利潤，奴役召各弱小民族，把他們變成非洲底奴隸。」（與上引文同見大會閉會辭）——就因爲他的愈老愈起勁的戰鬥，被惡魔的門徒毒殺，不得不放下他的戰旗，而這戰旗是要由一切被壓迫民族和新興階級的作家支撐起來！——它不會倒下！</p>
<p>「學習，革命的實踐，和一切被壓迫的人羣緊連在一起」：這是高爾基的一生的槪括。然而這歸納于，這個「奮門」！「奮鬥——這是生命的目的」！</p>
<p>在戰鬥中的我們文學靑年在戰門中！據着解放之旗，揚起反法西之幟，正該學習高爾基的奮門！從生活和書本中學習，參與　命的實踐，爭取自己民族的解放，並不斷地爲全人類的解放而努力，奮鬥！高爾基像</p>

<h3>學賑會女學團發表　告全港女同學書　革除奢侈習慣切實負起責任　×××××××××</h3>
<p>香港學生賬濟會組織女學團、定今日上午十一時假座靑年會舉行正式成立典禮、敦請婦女界名流王孝英先生演講、並有各種歌詠戲劇表演助慶、該會昨發表告全港女同學書、茲探錄原文如次、</p>
<p>親愛的全港女同學們：</p>
<p>中國婦女運動曾經在「五四」運動的大時代中蓬勃了一時、當時各階層的婦女——尤其是智識份子的女學生——、都紛紛自動起來參加一切鬥爭、而且熱烈地要求和爭取婦女在政治上、經濟上、敎育上的自由平等、她們在這次門爭中、表現出一種空前的勇敢和堅决、這可見得婦女在「五四」運動中已成為一支有力的鐵的隊伍、因此在「五四」運動的巨潮中、由于這一羣先進婦女的努力、開始和奠定了中國婦女運動的初基、可是她們因為力量薄弱、和沒有把婦運的鬥爭堅持下去、使到中國婦女運動從轟轟烈烈的開展隨着「五四」運動的失敗而漸漸的消沉下去了、</p>
<p>中國婦女本來就是受着數千年殘留下來的封建制度的壓迫、和宗法社會的束縛、所以中國婦女對本身解放的要求比在何國家都來得迫切、這一壓迫、直接的影響了和阻碍了中國婦女解故運動的前途、而且這一壓迫是全民族性的、是男女同樣受到的、因此佔了全國人口半數的婦女、就只有站起來和男子同樣的英勇、同樣的堅决地參加到民族解放鬥爭去、才能够爭取中國婦女的澈底解放、</p>
<p>自抗戰以來、中國婦女運動有了空前的高度的進展、如廬山婦女讓話會的召果、確定新運總會婦女指導委員會為全國總機構、各地婦女領袖如宋慶齡、宋美齡、何香凝、史良等的，極領導婦運、東北趙老太太的壯烈事蹟、各地女學生的戰地服務團、和廣西的女學生軍等等、鄒充任的表現出婦女在抗戰中的英勇姿態、可是這種進步還很不够、力量還很薄弱、、我們要實行這個總方針、就要團結更多的智識婦女，特別是女學生、參加婦運、在婦運中起一種模範作用、使成為婦女中的骨幹、和組織敎育廣大婦女羣衆的先鋒為的是學生是民族中最優秀最有力量的一羣、而學生運動和婦女運動同樣是民族解放運動中的重要部份、佔了學生中半數的女學生、是與婦運學運都有不可分離密切關係的、而且、他的組織和力量的健全與否、直接的影響到婦運與學運的發展前途、正因為如此，為要開展婦運、支持婦運、就非團結和組織廣大的女同學不可了，</p>
<p>同學們、香港的女學生在過去是一向散漫沒有組織的是被人目為「香港小姐」的，不是整天過着浪漫奢侈的享樂生活、便是困在封建的家屍裏，完全說不到什麼民挨解放與婦女解放、自全面抗戰展開後、香港一部份的學生被神聖的抗戰的炮火聲喚醒了、香港學生賑濟會也在抗戰的需要下建立起來、于是一小部份的女同學也在師長們的領導下參加到學生工作中去，可是、因為香港學運沒有基礎、到目前為止、團結在這個香港學生堡壘之下的女同學。還是很少、而且工作的表現和××的需要還差得很遠、但是我們女同學是在婦運學運中佔了非常重要的地位、在　運和學運的發展過程中、缺少了這一羣具有偉大力量的女學生是不飽咸功的、口此，更一廣泛的把我們全港的女同學團結起來、組織起來，支持學運、開展婦運、是不容許我們再延續下去了、</p>
<p>同學們、學　會的女學熙就是根據這需要而建立起來的、那麼、女學團究竟是怎樣的呢、我們可以簡單的說明一下、（一）女學團的基本任務就是團結全港的女同學、參加集體生活，增加抗戰　　、同時、更加在我們的互相　　、互相研究之下、發揮我們的力量、服務于國家民族、（二）女學團的工作方式、　　　香港的　　、用湊合女同學們的生活、　　女同學們的要求的工作方式、來把女同學們團結起來的、好像一方面我們可以　常過着集體的生活、放行、體育、歌詠、集　遊戲等有興趣的生活、另一方面我們可以進行讀書、研究、和社會服務、平民敎育有意義的工作、更在顧問和師長的指導下，和我們的互相勉勵之下完成我們的開展婦運支持學運的任務、</p>
<p>初愛的女同學們、我們今天要更淸整的認識我們的全民族中的地位與力量、把緊我們的任務、一點不要看輕自己、我們更希望女學團能够在同學們的擁護與督促之下、不斷的改善女同學所過去不良生活。漸漸的鞏固起來，壯大起來、眞正的負起××××、二解放婦女的偉大任務、中華民族解放萬歲，中國婦女解放萬歲二香港學生無濟會啓、</p>

<h3>「五羊城」的回憶</h3>
<p>— 夏衍</p>
<p>『五羊城」的上演把我帶進　囘憶的世界，第一是對于創作這個劇本的朋友們的遠念、第二是對于去年今日正在日機　烈轟炸下的廣州的　懷。</p>
<p>四年前的上海，是話劇運動值得懷念的地方，那時候我們有着一個小小的可以憑藉自己計畫來編輯　雜誌，我們就意識的在這雜誌上發表了一連串粗雜稚氣，但是或多或少地對于當時的救亡運動供獻了一些助力的劇本。那時候老是聚集在一起雜談的人，是洪深，張庚，尤兢，凌鶴，章泯，和我，我們總是十天或在半個月一次，在洪深先生常住的東方飯店吃飯，海闊天空的談話，結果是從這種雜談裏面產出了「漢奸的子孫』，「洋白糖」，和現在改編為「五羊城」的「我們的故鄉」之類的劇本。</p>
<p>當時的環境相當的微妙，但是，這一類短劇却正適應着全國各地劇團的野火一般的需要。在抗戰開始之前，「漢奸的子孫」是上演次數最多的劇本，但正因為如此，我們遭受了「愛必術」甚于愛國家的人們攻擊，「集體創作」這四個字變了我們的罪名，譴袁一直繼續到現在。——雖則我們並不將　種譴責看得嚴重。</p>
<p>在這種　談的集會中總是洪深講得最多，章泯講得最少，有一次我對一個剛惕守舊但是正義感强烈的老年人的性格發生了興趣、從這個性格出發，我們又雜談出了一個劇本，因為劇中的場所是在北平，而章泯在北平住得最久，所以就把執筆的責任推在他的身上。在當時創作的許多劇本中，我偏愛了這一個，因為不管怎樣，它是一個結構比較嚴整，而率先企圖性格地的描寫幾個劇中人物的一個嘗試。</p>
<p>抗戰一開始，當時在一起雜談的朋友們便風流雲散了，但是可以用驕矜來囘答那些當時譴責我們的人們，就是這一羣人現在都還站在戲劇的崗位上在作不屈的戰鬥。洪深凌鶴兩位在漢口，在長沙，在桂林，都見面過，這次到上海，尤兢還戀戀地說，「現在可沒有這麼一個可以上下古今無所不　　集會了，』他和我一樣地懷念着泯，沉默而頑强的他，一年半來寫了不少伊秀的劇本，不斷轟炸下的重　，我　確信會對他提供不少可泣可歌的材料的。</p>
<p>現在『我們的家鄉「被改編為『五羊城』了。</p>
<p>去年今日，我們正在整月轟炸下的廣州，從五月廿七至六月三十，轟炸沒有一天間息，但是六月的廣州，富在太可愛了，那時候正是薑花和荔枝節季啊！儘管在血脾和硝烟中、死亡威脅答我，但我無論如何也引不起離開廣州的念　。這對于廣州的愛情，我和劇中人的王祖章沒有兩樣，雖則這迷人的都市，並不是我的『故鄉」，我可以率直地表白，我愛廣州甚于「故鄉」的西湖，但是，永遠不能忘記的十月二十一日凌晨離開了她之後，現在也祗能和劇中的那一羣一樣，深深的為懷鄉病所苛遇了。影樹花已謝，現在已經是番石榴的時候了吧。</p>
<p>我相信着：可以使異鄉人的我這樣摯愛的廣州，在廣東人的心　中，地的愛着和敵愾一定百　　于我們。慄悍而以愛鄉土著名於世界的百粵同胞，一定不會讓這沾汚廣州的恥尋凝結在他們心上的。</p>
<p>去看一看「五羊城」。別忘記了「我們的故鄉」</p>
<p>「黎明之前」上演之日</p>
<h3>留港劇人空前大團結　「黎明之前」的聯合義演</h3>
<p>— 史亮</p>
<p>為了促進戲劇界的精誠團結，為了供献現階段高度水準的戲劇藝術，為了籌款捐助祖國文化事業的善舉，國內留港的戲劇工作者、特別地在短促的時間迅速地把力的單位組合起來，集成一股權的洪流，於前昨十六，七兩日夜在利舞台舉行空前　，留港劇人聯合大義演」，劇目是集合四個最精粹最優秀的代表劇作而成的「黎明之前」，內容都是描寫黎明將要到來的可歌可泣的鬥爭故事。現在，佈憑觀感所得，簡略的寫出幾點，算是我個人的觀後感吧！</p>
<p>參加這次聯合義演的團體是國內留港最著名的三大劇團——中華藝術劇團——中國旅行劇團，中國救亡劇團。導演是歐陽予倩和金山，出演劇人（以姓氏筆劃多少為序）是：王瑩，李景波，李丹露，金黎，金山，姜明，柯剛，唐槐秋，唐若靑，唐若英，范政，孫兆新，秦小竹，張立　，黃河，童毅，楊薇，鄧竹筠，葛鑫，　雅梅，　子英，蘇繪等，都是造詣極深的優秀劇人，努力劇運已有深長歷史。可惜，過去都因為各自工作環境的關係，在救亡劇運的工作上，都是分頭苦幹，這一次的合作——這樣緊密的合作，還是「破題兒第一遭」呢！</p>
<p>姑在强化戲劇界團結運動——香港的，全國的——這一意義上，這一次的聯合大義演，應該有他的歷史價值，這一次演出，充分的表現了集體的力量，甩這種力量，大破了一切的障　，大家流着汗，勉强睜　失眠的眼睛，熱忱的工作着，終於因為是集體的行動，是科學的分工，所以才收到那樣事半功倍的效果。</p>
<p>而包　在這一集體裏的份子，有過港卽將出國宣傳的中救」，有分家以後各立門戶分頭苦幹的中旅，「中藝一，在為捐助國內文化事業籌款的號召之下，在加强戲　界團結運動的號召之下，大家親密的携起手來了，這一點，卽在中旅，中藝，中救的本身說來，也是極有意義的呢！</p>
<p>這次演出的劇本總名稱是「黎明之前」，包括四個獨幕，這幾個劇正是中國現有獨幕劇中最好的劇本，除出「曙光」之外，差不多濱的次數很多的戲了、四個劇中，有兩個是曾在「保護祖國」這一結題之下，和香　的觀衆見過面的「賊」和「賣藝者」，但是前一次中救的公演，每場的滿座，那些因買不到票子而怨聲退囘的向　者，誰不至今尚有遺憾？這個遺憾現在算有了補補償的機會了、「賣藝人」、就是「逃難到香港」，也就是「放下你的鞭子」］這一抗戰以前和以後上演次數最多的，記錄保持者，也許香港的觀衆大都看過這個戲，可是，金山王塋兩個演這個戲却是「聞名全國」的，在戰區，聽到「上海救亡演劇第二隊」演「放下你的鞭子前線兄弟們會歡喜得發狂的」，金山和王瑩在『賣　者』中一個是　頽的老漢一個是嬌弱難女演起來唯妙唯肖，深刻動人，加上在兒童工作極有成績的十三歲小朋友花政，在這戲中演小徒第一段快書，說得恰到好處，難怪全國話劇界，也公認為他們的演技是標準化了的呢！</p>
<p>「曙光」是中藝領導人歐陽予倩先生的近作以三十年努力劇運始終如一的歐陽先生，於今來自編自導，又加上姜明，李景波，李丹霞，楊　，孫兆新，張立法，童毅，鄰雅梅葛鑫諸位的演技，雖然是一個獨幕劇，却在我腦筋中留下一個頗深的印象，李景波，他在這次演一個要為國出力，到祖國去服務的汽車夫，而　明這次演一個有錢不出矓的老爺他聽見募捐就頭痛，發火，但是用在私生活的浪費上，却不吝千金，進兩個角色演得極其神妙，令人看了啼笑昔非，此外，還有李丹　的太太，楊薇的二太太，孫兆新的女兒，鄒在　各　　之妙；這是　陽予　先生曲新作，一幕動人的職。</p>
<p>「贖罪」的　劇人是進次祖任舞台監　的　衍先生，導濱是金山先生，——這四個戲中，金山先生是三個戲的導演，『而贖罪』是他最近趕出來的。</p>
<p>最難得的，是「唐氏三傑』在一個獨幕戲裏同時和觀衆見面，這是許多年來不常有的事，劇本在心理的描寫上，賣了相當的氣力，而演員在這一方面，也變得了很好的成就，全劇輕鬆活潑，使你沒一絲倦意。</p>
<p>「賊」是中救改編的。在「賣　人」中的扮老漢的金山，扮鄉女的王瑩，到這個戲　，却完全「面貌一新」，一個變丁洋場　少，一價扮了舉登夫人，對看了這兩　戲，可以使人眼花撩亂，想不到人的面貌，年齡，性格，可以這樣快的幻變，但是演員表上寫得淸淸　楚，不由你不信，劇本輕鬆　永，慷慨激昂，兼而有之，經他們兩位演來，眞盡潑辣諷　之能事！</p>
<p>本內容均為描寫黎明將到來前之可歌可泣的故事，現　的題材，國內負極大盛譽的演員……這些，使這次的演出，雖不能就說是中國話劇的圾高水準的作品獻演，但是，却可以說是××戲劇難能的收獲。</p>
<p>而最大的成功是把留港戲人一起搬上了舞台，一方面各展所長，各盡其技，一方面彼此緊密的團結起來，為××戲劇而奮鬥！</p>
<h3>中旅『五羊城』義演前奏　幾個重要的粵語說演員的介紹</h3>
<p>— 林之</p>
<p>眞使人高興，在劇運正積極擴展的香港，多少次「義演」風起雲湧地舉行着；最近而最顯著的，如全港戲劇界」黃花崗』的聯合義演，「中旅」鳳凰城的義演，『中救」出國前的義演，以及前昨兩天舉行的留港劇人聯合義演」黎明之前」……還有許多學校，許多社團舉行的演出，都牧獲了很良好的捐賑成績，很有力的宣傳效果，這種現象除了證明許多戲劇組合的熱忱救國以外，還表現着「話劇」已漸漸引起港地各界人士的注意，將要達到普遍地為大衆所接受的境地，這豈不是極為可喜的狀態嗎！</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團自從重建以後，對于一切應適時代而可能做到的事，都很努力，所以它第一次的工作表現，就是以純義務演出「鳳凰城」在皇后與各界人士相見，得到了觀衆們和文化藝　界朋友們的鼓勵和贊助。不過，那還僅是「中旅」一部份力　的表現，因為中　現在有能力相等的兩個部隊，為了適應華南觀衆的方言，粵語部隊也是從「重建」之日起。就組織起來；到現在，已經埋頭苦幹地準備之作了半年，磨礪以須等候出動。</p>
<p>現在，中旅的粵語部隊也　以第一次演出貢献給國家：所上次國語演出的一鳳凰城」就是他導演的；對於他，似乎是無須多說了。</p>
<p>這裏要特別提出的，就是飾演劇中李葆貞的鄧竹筠小姐，她是粵語部隊最重要的女演員，因其演技之圓熟和工作態度之懇切，許多戲都由她主演。她是廣東三水人，年方二二康健，活潑而明媚，眞像「春」一樣地温煦，「水」一樣地流星，十七歲時起就開始戲劇活動，在廣州各學校客串過許多戲，幷且同張雪峯合作創辨「鋒社」，公演過許多國防劇，以後在澳門工作，發動了不少學校劇運。「我們的故鄉」對於她是熟戲，從前在廣州公演的時候，曾經洪深先生鑑定，認為表情動作老練，有一種特　吸引觀衆的魔力。現在她的演技更加精進，排練更為認眞，應當可以有更進一步的成就吧！</p>
<p>張瑛扮演王仲文，很恰切。而最難能的是李亨飾演的王錦文，眞是對於戲中人的性格心情揣摹得淋漓盡致，溶化在他那圓熟的演技裏，表演的深刻自然充份地表現他是極有前途的劇人。</p>
<p>徐曼的女傭，戲雖不多而噱頭甚佳：張倫的粗線條表演够强硬，梁山飾演劉　生也很努力。其餘如了兆　，張雨峯等也都有　恰切的演出。</p>
<p>這裏還有兩個很可注意的國語演員，担任了兩個很重要的角色，因為們都是廣東人，所以很能勝任愉快！！一個是飾王祖章的廖凡，對於這個剛强老人刻劃嚴　，超過他以前演過一切的戲，理解表演都有　得之妙。還有一個是扮演殷家明的黃河，演演反派心領神會，排戲時都很引起同志們的厭恨</p>
<p>此外，國語部隊的唐槐秋在劇中演一個帳房先生，　家　趙恕等也都有上台跑跑龍套，一則表示」中旅」的合作精神，二則提提觀衆的興趣。</p>
<p>概括地講，「五羊城」演出的「圓」和「細」方面，應當可以超過「凰鳳城』吧，祝他　多多努力！</p>
<p>以當嶺南大學的學生自治會决定要舉行義演為傷兵難民籌款而邀請「中旅」担任演出時，中旅就立刻同意以『五羊城」的專語演出來報效。現在已經决定在本月二十二號晚九時在皇后戲院舉行，性質和辦法都與上次『鳳風城」的義演大略相同。</p>
<p>「五羊城」是「中旅』已經準備了幾個月的戲，劇本由「我們的故鄉」改編，在張雪峯精密導演之下，整個的戲發展得極其圓熟，極其生動，可以說是細　而生動，現在特地把我參觀他們排演的觀感和裏面幾個最重要的演員介紹一下，或者也是愛好戲劇的同志們所樂於知道的吧。</p>
<p>首先要說到的，就是祖負着導演工作，舞台設計，舞台裝置，而又兼飾劇中一個老用人的張雪峯，他的能力是多方面的，並且都　够親目動手，除了粵語部隊由他負責之外，全團的舞台　置都是他一手料理的，他參加了許多學校社團的排演工作，精練周到，任勞任怨，</p>
<p>「五羊城」女主角鄧竹　小姐</p>
<h3>我們需要黎明</h3>
<p>— 黃華</p>
<p>只要『覺今是而昨非」的力行，任憑黎明之前是怎麼　　充滿　　　　和　　，怎麼樣的　鈴誤與慘酷，但是　　　曙光　有　臨時。</p>
<p>兩日來留港劇人「黎明之前」的聯合大公演，是針對現實的切要的刺，激二把黎明之前和將曙之際的現狀盡　表露出來，刻劃出未明前社會間的矛盾現象，發揮了各階層的同胞們一致底共嗚，無論是賊，是貪　，是佳公子，是流浪人，是小孩，是老頭……當他們覺悟的時候，都發出了洪亮的吼聲！「我們需要黎明」！</p>
<p>黎明——是愉快，活潑，和自由，平等，解放內　徵，黎明，將照耀着我們跑「抗戰必　，建國必成」的共同目標，是至大至光的眞理的火把，是中華民族的福音。</p>
<p>這次的演出，誠然緊抓着，和感　了無數觀衆的心靈，把悲慘，痛苦，激昂二慷慨的動作，緊迫着每一個熱血滿腔的中華見女們的內心，把國　家　，新愁舊恨都交縈在眼前，單就「賣藝者」一幕來說，已使人禁不住的掉下同情的熱淚，繼而作興奮的呼叫，倘用兩句話來形容這演出，實在可說得「悲慘也悲慘到極點，興奮也興奮到極點」，尤其是逃難到香港而有「同感一的我們；益感到過去所盡的責任是不够而需要「贖罪」的。</p>
<p>上演劇人們的認眞精　，和嚴謹的熊度眞令人肅然起敬，這一點已絕是很難藝的，多寶　的。</p>
<p>這次的聯演，無疑　地加强了本港劇運的聯合陣線的力量，已表現出空前的進　步了，空前的團結了，更希望把這種力量保持着，和不斷的强化着。</p>
<p>我們需要抗戰建國的　明，同時也需要達到本港戲劇界聯合陣線的黎明、</p>
<p>同志們，拿出力量來，明將在我們的眼前哩！</p>
<h3>「梁紅玉」史劇的理論研究</h3>
<p>— 劉丹靑</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團集體創作的「台兒　之戰」，在港演出、轟動一時，空前的擴大了戲劇的感效與領域·該劇本已由生活書店出版，為該團　　第一種，上期本刊已有文介紹·現該團叢書第二種，已定」梁紅玉「（又名「黃天　」）的四　　史劇由該團劉丹靑同於執筆，不日出版。本文即為　劉君　　該劇之理論根據，特先發表於此。　編者</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團出國宣傅的準備工作，是多方面的而劇本的準備也是其一。除了已經演出的「　兒作之戰」和其他已有的劇本之外，洪深先生和夏衍先生都答應給我們供給最近　作的劇本，但是為了適應海外某些地方的特殊情勢和特殊要求起見，我們打算準備一些間接宣傳××的歷史劇。</p>
<p>在許多歷史上的民埃英雄故事中，我們選定了岳飛和梁紅玉。但是有的先生們提供意見，以為　　　一定少不了　　，少不了岳飛　的悲　結局，而這對於目前的抗戰形勢是不　合的·我們接受了這個意見，所以把注意集中到　紅玉這個問題。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生的歌劇「　紅玉」，無論在形式上，內容上都是很好的劇本。但是我們用話劃的形式來重編「梁紅玉」史劇，有兩個先决問題：第一，我們沒有中國歌劇上的許多技巧可以利用，而必須用別的東西來彌補　　短；第二，我們不要把歷史當做舊瓶子拿來裝新　，　叫宋朝，來說現在的話，因為歷史發展有牠本身的法則，也有配備不同的環境和風格，但是可以互相說明的。麼，我們根據的是什麼呢？便就是現實主義，歷史的現實主義，一歷史的，現實的人物，工具，生活，習慣和風格。</p>
<p>讀宋史，研究宋金戰爭歷史，不免發生兩個疑問，就是：金方何以勝而宋方何以敗？宋方有沒有具備足　　的力量可以打退敵人？</p>
<p>對於第一個問題，　現在的眼光看來，不免有些奇怪。論兵舀，武器，財力，土地，金方不是一個佔優勢的　，而　方不是一個處劣勢的弱國，可是宋方終於居下風，吃敗仗·這是唯武器論的不可　。從他方面說來，金方　是一個落后的小國，却能在戰爭中强大起來，宋方雖是一個先進的大國，在退讓中　弱下去。這證明作戰雙方的國力是可以　勁的。變動的區紐，崅在整個的　略和戰略上。宋方朝庭之上，忠奸不明，賞罰不定，和戰不决，外失　內失民心，主戰　指揮不一，主和則委曲求全，對　勇殺敵的軍民民不加以獎勵，對奉偽降敵的奸賊不加以採討，這難怪要一敗塗地了。</p>
<p>第二個問題，宋方有沒有具備足够的力量可以打退×人呢，這可以肯定說，有的·宋方在南遷定都以前，根本就沒有和敵人作主力决戰，四方猶有動王之兵，東南更有充裕之財，論將帥則有李綱，宗澤，　師道，岳飛，韓世忠；論士氣則有陳東，徐揆，歐陽澈；論人心則兩河雖失，金之所守者不過數城，其餘大部份均在擁戴宋室的軍民手中，日思朝庭出兵規復失地，可惜徴、欽，高諸帝和李邦彥，黃潛善，汪伯彥，秦檜之流，一貫的懷着恐金病一，不信任全國軍民的力量，葡安而終不能安。</p>
<p>俗話說得好，養虎遺患；金這隻惡虎，是宋給養起來的·金本來是一個落後小國，可是因為他能够集中權力，更利用了　的人力，財力，得寸進　，吞兩河，併兩京，進犯兩湖，兩，據二帝，追高宗於定海·從此可以看到，强鄰　　，是不會適可而止的。金兵的暴行更是難以盤　，單是在平江一地，金兵焚掠，死者五十萬人。</p>
<p>一方面有東　　敵的　賊，一方面也有　　　　　將·岳飛戰廣德，六戰皆捷，戰常州，四戰皆捷；韓　　以八千人拒金兀朮十萬衆於鎭江江中，凡四十八日。</p>
<p>其實金兵並不是可怕的。當兀朮陷臨安，追高宗於海的時候，勢如破竹，何其得意揚揚，但是囘兵鎭江，　到韓世忠的軍隊，一戰之下，　兵折將，自己的女婿龍虎大王亦被俘虜，於是虎頭蛇尾，向　軍討饒，情願把所有在江南　來的東四獻給韓軍，不許，益以名馬，又不許，並且求與世忠會語，祈請　哀。由此，金兵　　　之態，是可以看得出來的。</p>
<p>兀朮擁十萬雄兵。敗於黃天蕩，實建康牛頭山，又敗於岳飛，然而　　之兵自　來　，漢奸　　　　　　，用火箭，　　　　突破水陸重國而去·這證明宋兵只有戰術而無戰略，不能有持久，全面的，　　　人的完　計劃。但是說宋兵沒有戰略，不如說宋　沒有。</p>
<p>然而贛世忠，梁紅玉以戰敗國八千之眾，　金兀求十萬　兵，　之四十八日，這個意義是非常偉大的。</p>
<p>把梁紅玉擂鼓退金兵這一段英勇故事，用話劇的方式表現在舞台上，我們把　下列　　　：</p>
<p>（一）主和論和主　論的矛盾；主和論，恐金病的荒謬無恥；主戰論佔了優勢的時候，所表現的抗戰力量。</p>
<p>（二）韓世忠，梁紅玉方面的要求，適應軍民一致的要求，充滿了不屈不撓，爭取勝利的決心。</p>
<p>（三）金兵的擴　，奸　，野心，殘暴，和他的弱點。</p>
<p>（四）抵抗金兵，是當時宋朝軍民共同的責任。</p>
<p>（五）金兵是可以克服的，宋室是可以復興的·</p>
<p>（六）其他。</p>
<p>總的任務，就是　　宋室杭金的力量，並且客觀的批判他的錯誤，而且把這一切「形象化」起來。</p>
<p>其實歷史只是歷史，歷史本身就是一　經　和教訓，可以和現在的事情互相印登，互相說明，或者說給我們一個參考，但是決不可和現在的事情混為一談，目前我們的抗戰，是一種弱小小民族反對法西斯的戰爭，這一點知宋金之戰是完全不同的，我們全國一致的堅持持久戰，全面戰的政略和戰略，有計劃，有進步，這簡值不能與和戰不决的宋室同日而語；我們的敵人日本是一個　濟上相當進步的資本主義國家，這又是漁獲游牧民族的金國所不能比擬的了；我們是一　經濟比較落後的大而弱的　家，但是可以在戰爭中進步，增强起來，日本是一個經濟比較進步的們　强的國家，但是可以在戰爭中退化，削弱下去，這又是和宋金雙方對　　同的。</p>
<p>這些　，不過是表示一種處理歷史材料的觀點而已，並不都要在劇本中設出來。我們請　　來看歷史劇，就讓觀眾用他自己的感覺和思想來接受歷史的啓示吧！</p>
<p>我們　　同情</p>
<p>前言：大地影業公司的建立在香港，可說是華南電影界劃時期的有意義的工作。——關於這，我們在本刊第廿四期已經介紹過了。這篇文章，見最近出版的「大地影訊」第一期，在這篇文章裏，可以反映出一面是怎樣荒淫與無恥，一面是怎樣莊嚴的工作。同時，更可以看出他們今後對電影製作的正確態度與積極苦幹的鬥爭精神！這是誓師的宣言，是出征的號角！為了眞正的國防藝術的前途、亦為神聖的民族解放鬥爭，是使我　感到無限興　和欣幸的。因特不避宣傳之嫌，亟為轉載，幸讀者勿忽視之！</p>

<h3>我們需要同情</h3>
<p>— 蔡楚生</p>
<p>從連天連夜廢寢忘飱的工作中抬起頭來，重揑着這管筆桿想寫　什麼，雖然感利不可排遣的疲倦，但也感到莫可名狀的興奮——另外　是不能自己地覺得百感交縈—</p>
<p>我記得費穆先生說過一句不曾公開（那時是在徐浩先生招待電影界的會場上）說出來的活，他說：「餓死事小，失節事大』。這話當時使我深深地感到共嗚而欲流涕。他雖然不曾說出來，却自己暗暗在實行但在這『澆漓之世」。（這話也許還不够形容吧？）有些人是把「餓死』看得比「失節』還要「事大』的，因此，說話是可以像放屁一樣的不負責任，什麼溧亮的名辭，好聽的字眼，都會給不知廉恥是什麼東西的人搬出來運用，而以之欺騙別人，同時也用以欺騙自己！究竟是人話呢，或者是鬼話？也許正有很多人弄不淸楚吧？有時，雖然是一句普通到祗是在最低限度以下的語，但要說話的人們切實去執行起來，却就成為一，件比殺頭還要困　的事情了，從這點上看，費穆先生應被看成優子，而我們這一羣早被判定「非餓死不可」的人。自然也不是東西！</p>
<p>然而，天地間的眞理興正義，在人類還不可能囘到洪荒的禽獸時代以前，是總有一天要伸張的。這就像過了一個悠長的黑夜，或是一次暴風雨，或是一陣子陰晦之後，和煦的陽光必定會重照臨到大地上來；也就像往古來今，大大小小的無數侵略者，一時雖囂張到透頂，但必有一天要步上總崩潰的途路而歸於毀滅一樣，這都是必然而且非常目然的事，所以，我們正不必觳觫，胆寒，我們更廳堅定我們的信心，　以永　不渝，為　　理與止議　　們。</p>
<p>「大地」是在這充滿黑暗而　　的氣氛，用怕任何　　時　　　立起來的一個新組織，它沒有包涵什麼「老於世故」的一聰明人」也是沒有什麼雄厚至可令人「喪魂落魄一的資本，更沒有夢想到將來能成為藝術上（假如在中國也有藝術的話）的什麼藝閥」和商業上的什麼托拉斯」，它所有的祗是一羣「大孩子」——一種不知人世間艱辛困苦的苦鬥的精神。同時，它也沒有什麼「崇高」的企圖，它祗是想做一些平月到不能再平凡的，每一個「人」所應該做的事情。如果要說得明白一點，那麼就是我們將堅守藝人（假如有藝人的話）在「非常時期」中的崗位，在不抹然一藝術的良心」的原則之下，以最大的努力從事於我們的工作如果還要說得更明白一點，那麼就是我們將以實際的行動來證明我們過去所發的，曾　義為一祇會說漂亮話」，或是有些人曾加以一嬉笑怒罵」的言論底眞實性，但我們有沒惡意，相反地，我們正以萬分熱誠和善意希望曾加以懷　者之有「覺今是而昨非的一天，而共同從事於同一目標的努力，</p>

<h3>The International Significance of Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>— Qian Junrui</p>
<p>Spiritual mobilization is the core of political mobilization, and political mobilization is the starting point for the total mobilization of the entire people. Without political mobilization as a foundation, the mobilization of manpower and resources will not be solid or thorough. At the same time, if spiritual mobilization—political mobilization—is not followed by the total mobilization of manpower and resources of the entire people, then the so-called spiritual mobilization and political mobilization will be empty and illusory.</p>
<p>In the past, when Russia and Japan were at war, Tsarist Russia was aggressive externally but extremely corrupt internally. The Tsar did not transport ammunition to the troops, but instead supplied the soldiers with carts full of icons. As a result, the soldiers angrily said: "The Japanese are hitting us with ammunition, and we are hitting them with icons." This was also spiritual mobilization, but it was the spiritual mobilization of the aggressors, which is completely different from ours.</p>
<p>Now the German and Italian fascists are also carrying out spiritual mobilization. Hitler, in order to realize the "Third Reich" and dominate Europe, does not hesitate to use idols such as religious emperors, engaging in mystification; he tells the people to save bread for cannons and tighten their belts to be cannon fodder. The goal of Hitler's spiritual mobilization is that the Germans come first (see Article 4 of the National Socialist Party's policy outline), but in reality, big capitalists come first (the German masses also suffer); it is to drive out the Jews! (In reality, it is to drive out anti-fascist people!); it is to deprive the people of true electoral rights, political participation rights, and freedom of speech and publication! (Articles 6 and 23 of the policy outline); it is to stipulate that all working people must serve the capitalists (Article 10); it is Greater German nationalism! (Article 20)! It is that the whole country is militarized, and everyone should be cannon fodder for the financial oligarchy (Article 20)!</p>
<p>Mussolini has his own set of methods to carry out spiritual mobilization. In general, his spiritual mobilization has seven major goals: first, to eliminate provincial and municipal autonomy; second, to close all schools that do not use the Italian language; to prohibit the use of foreign languages; third, to change the unique surnames of the people; fourth, to absolutely prohibit associations; sixth, to have no freedom to publish newspapers: to prohibit any form of political life; seventh, to build a politics of terror and violence (see Count Corlo Sforza, "Ten Years of Fascism," American Foreign Affairs Magazine, issue 11).</p>
<p>Most interestingly, our × people are also carrying out spiritual mobilization. What the × people are suffering from most now is domestic unrest. The anti-war thinking and anti-war movements of the general public are the gravediggers of the Japanese warlords and fascists. Therefore, their spiritual mobilization mainly involves suppressing the people's thoughts and prohibiting the people's freedom of assembly and association; the tool for their mobilization is still Bushido. The consolation they give to soldiers is still Buddha statues and "thousand-stitch belts." Their so-called theory of "long-term construction" teaches the people to be slaves for a long time. They use the "Imperial Way spirit" to mobilize the people to be cannon fodder forever.</p>
<p>The above are all spiritual mobilizations of aggressors. Their real purpose is to seek spiritual desolation and the annihilation of the soul, and to allow the fascist minds to slaughter them at will. Everyone is like a mummy, listening to their arrangements and going to their deaths.</p>
<p>The spiritual mobilization of oppressed nations is completely different. It is anti-aggression, upward, active, and a spiritually inspiring mobilization. It is definitely not a regressive, passive, and shrunken "non-mobilization" of the spirit.</p>
<p>What is the banner of today's National Spiritual Mobilization of China? It is the Three Principles of the People, it is the "Three Principles of the People for which we strive, which are externally for independence, freedom, and equality, and internally for government of the people, by the people, and for the people—</p>
<p>Now, we are the main pillar of the world's anti-aggression efforts. Our spiritual mobilization should have all the characteristics of the world's anti-aggression vanguard:</p>
<p>First, it is to resist aggression to the end with arms and never compromise midway. Therefore, our spiritual mobilization has stipulated: "Military affairs come first, victory comes first!" It stipulates that "During this period, there should be no so-called personal gains or losses, personal interests, or personal humiliation or honor. Only seeking military victory is the glory shared by everyone in our country. Only failing to achieve victory is the greatest shame for everyone." Regarding this, we must first strike at Wang Jingwei and his ilk's advocacy and ideology of national betrayal and seeking peace.</p>
<p>Second, implement total mobilization of the entire people and complete the modern revolutionary war. Therefore, the mobilization program stipulates: "Modern warfare is a war of total mobilization of the entire people. Therefore, not only should all domestic materials and manpower be mobilized, but the spirit of the people throughout the country must also be mobilized." It stipulates "Concentrate the spirit of the people throughout the country on simple and common goals, so that the people throughout the country establish the same patriotic morality for themselves, firmly establish the same national construction belief for the country, and the people remember to struggle and sacrifice according to the same moral concept for the same belief." Regarding this, we must first oppose and restrain individual advocacy and actions of popular mobilization.</p>
<p>Third, implement the spirit of democracy and solidify unity and unification. Regarding democracy, the program stipulates "Popularization of the national political consciousness during wartime," "Accelerate the cultivation of true civil rights" (according to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's regulations, true civil rights are direct civil rights, that is, in addition to the right to vote, there are also the rights of initiative, referendum, and recall). It stipulates that we must "first seek the enrichment of the national spirit," "so that it is vigorous and radiant, firm, upright, and strong, and has the power to overcome the environment and resist difficulties." Regarding unity, the program stipulates "The nation comes first, the ethnicity comes first," and "Concentration of will, concentration of strength," stipulating "The joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the country to resist ×'s cause will further enhance the unity of the entire nation." We demand "the concentration of one spirit," that is, "seeking its close unity, with one heart and one mind, and a multitude of wills becoming a fortress, so as to achieve a state of absolute sharing of weal and woe and never being separated." Regarding this, we must first strike at all words and actions that sow discord and oppose democracy.</p>
<p>With these three things, our spiritual total mobilization will become an upward, active, and vibrant anti-aggression mobilization. This kind of mobilization is not only necessary for China's resistance against Japan today, but also necessary for peace-loving countries and nations around the world to resist the mad dogs of aggression.</p>
<h3>World Trends in a Week</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>From June 4th to 10th of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]</p>
<p>Due to the British government's continued attachment to the policy of compromise, and the stalling of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations on initiating an anti-aggression front, the aggressors have become even more frantic and active this week.</p>
<p>In the West, the two great aggressor demons, Germany and Italy, have been greatly stirring up trouble this week. From the Baltic Sea in the north to northern Africa in the south, and from Syria east of the Red Sea, the poison of the aggressors is flying everywhere.</p>
<p>In the East, the Japanese aggressors, in order to cover up their military failures in invading China, and in order to help deploy their political offensive, have adopted an even more shameless and tyrannical anti-British movement, provoking the Tianjin Incident and igniting the flames of war to drive out the forces of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East.</p>
<p>Along with the severity of the international situation, the strength of our country's resistance war has made greater progress. In the Hunan-Hubei area, the advance of the × army was stopped. In southwestern Shanxi, the × people were dealt a major blow, and more than 10,000 × people were annihilated. In addition, good news has come from Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and even southern China. Militarily, we are indeed increasingly approaching the stage of victory.</p>
<p>(1) The British Government Seeks Compromise, Germany, Italy, and × Light Fires Everywhere</p>
<p>We already pointed out last week that the ruling British financial capitalists continue to adopt a policy of compromise and retreat, and that this policy will inevitably deepen the crisis in Britain, France, and other democratic and peaceful countries. This week, the situation has become even more obvious.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 8, British Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a foreign policy speech, clarifying the British government's foreign policy. The main point is still to seek compromise in order to reach a compromise with the aggressors. He said: "If the independence of all countries is respected by the international community, then Britain is not only willing to jointly review economic issues with Germany and other European countries, but is also extremely willing to do so." On the evening of the 9th, British Prime Minister Chamberlain also said: "Britain is still prepared to discuss the demands of Germany or any other country by means of a conference...cannot resort to force."</p>
<p>It's like saying to a robber who has already broken into your house: "...Don't use force!... Whatever you want, let's talk about it!" Do you think this has any possibility of stopping the robber?</p>
<p>Sure enough, the German and Italian aggressors saw through the British government's predicament, and in the past few days, they have intensified their frenzy! On June 11, Reuters Berlin reported that Germany was again carrying out military deployments on its eastern and western borders, building "defensive" works and especially equipping itself with new heavy military equipment. On the 10th, the Central News Agency reported from Budapest that German party and government officials were flocking to Hungary in an attempt to strengthen German-Hungarian relations. And on the 15th, Reuters New York reported that 250,000 German troops had concentrated in northern Slovakia along the Polish border! Germany's complete annexation of Czechoslovakia, Moravia, and Bohemia is about to become a reality. And the Italian aggressors are preparing for a major Atlantic exercise, attempting to carry out a major demonstration against Britain. They are lighting the flames of war everywhere like this!</p>
<p>(2) Japanese × Blockade Tianjin Concessions, Dangerous Storm Clouds over the Pacific</p>
<p>As for the Japanese aggressors, naturally, like Germany and Italy, they have intensified their attacks on Britain, one of the weakest links in the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>From June 14th, the Japanese × implemented a blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, coercing the British and French authorities to accept their unscrupulous demands. The Japanese × accused the British side of (1) harboring anti-Japanese elements and communists, (2) supporting Chinese legal tender and hindering the circulation of United Reserve Bank counterfeit currency, (3) raising prices, (4) allowing the use of unregistered radios, and (5) allowing schools within the concessions to use anti-Japanese textbooks. The Japanese side declared: "If Britain does not change its policy and does not recognize the new situation in North China in order to cooperate with Japan in building a new order in East Asia, then Japan will not lift the blockade." And before and after the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, such atrocities as beating and killing British nationals, expanding anti-British propaganda, and intimidating the British ambassador to China with "buying assassins to carry out assassinations" are unimaginable to the general public!</p>
<p>The Japanese ×'s anti-British atrocities are in fact due to the serious difficulties encountered in the military invasion of China, and because the political offensive has failed to achieve much progress. Therefore, they want to use these atrocities to threaten Britain to abandon its anti-aggression policy and its policy of supporting China's resistance war, and instead negotiate a compromise with the Japanese × to oppress China into submission. If this attempt fails, the Japanese × also wants to use these atrocities to gradually plunder the rights and interests of Britain and France in China, drive out the forces of Britain and France in China, strengthen the rule of the occupied areas, resolve their current difficulties, and prepare for new offensives.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can assert that if the Japanese ×'s anti-British atrocities are not dealt a painful blow, then the bloody storms over the Pacific will ruthlessly strike! As our Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said on the 14th: "Assuming that accepting Japan's demands can solve this kind of arbitrary violation of China and third countries, it is a mistake. These Far Eastern aggressors are now waiting for an opportunity to completely close the door of China and drive Western forces out of Asia. But if the powers can persist in this and all countries can take collective action to stop buying goods and all supplies, then Japan's speculation will eventually fail."</p>
<p>(3) The Policy of Compromise is Rejected Worldwide, the Peace Front Takes Another Step</p>
<p>Under the increasingly adventurous offensives of Japan, Germany, and Italy recently, the policy of compromise and retreat has been opposed by all peace-loving and just people. This tide of opposition has first risen among the British people, who have suffered the most damage. On the 10th, Reuters London reported that "The conciliatory tone used by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in their recent speeches has not only displeased the opposition, but has also made some people who support the government feel unhappy." Secondly, the French side is even more fiercely opposed to the revival of Britain's policy of compromise. The London Daily Telegraph's Paris correspondent reported that the French generally believe that "The German government still firmly believes that Britain is unwilling to fight. This fact and the speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are the greatest crisis in the current serious political situation"!</p>
<p>On the one hand, opposing the policy of compromise, on the other hand, is promoting the movement of the anti-aggression peace front. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech to the Conservative Party on the 10th, saying: "Britain has now decided to organize a peace front...there is no turning back!" He also warned: "All non-aggressive countries, regardless of their political system, should be included in the peace front. Otherwise, it would be the most unwise move!... Although we do not like communist ideology, the Soviet Union is a non-aggressive country and does not advocate expanding its territory, and should not be rejected."</p>
<p>Since the Tianjin Incident, this movement to promote the joint resistance of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and other countries against aggressor countries has become more common in Britain and France. For example, at the British House of Lords meeting on the 12th, it was unanimously advocated that the government should take a tough stance against Japan, take joint steps with the United States and France, and strengthen assistance to China. And Britain maintains close contact with the United States and France on issues related to Britain, the United States, and France."</p>
<p>In fact, in the week since the Tianjin Incident, Britain, the United States, and France have been able to consistently oppose the atrocities of the Japanese ×. The military authorities of Britain and France stationed in the Far East have already set off for Singapore to hold a military conference. The large-scale exercise of the United States Pacific Fleet is continuing, and there is also news that the large-scale exercise of the Soviet Union's Pacific Navy is about to begin. Regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, British special envoy Strang has arrived in Moscow and has had contacts with the Soviet foreign ministry. Although the new British plan has not changed much and is therefore still far from success, under the pressure of the international and domestic situation, the British government will eventually change its policy!</p>
<p>(4) Another Great Victory on the Northwest Front, No Need to Worry about the Situation in Hunan and Guangdong</p>
<p>In the week's resistance war against Japan, there were fierce battles in northern Hunan, Shandong, and southern Henan, but the focus was still in western and southern Shanxi. Since last week, the × bandits have concentrated their strength to advance the so-called sweeping war in the two provinces of Shanxi and Shandong. However, after our strong counterattack, not only did they fail to make any progress, but they also suffered heavy losses and were defeated. As in the southern Shanxi area, the × bandits divided their troops into nine routes from last week to carry out the eighth offensive in Zhongtiao Mountain, but they were caught in our clever mobile warfare plan. We began a counteroffensive on the 9th, captured Maojindu on the 10th, captured Pinglu on the 11th, and captured Daicheng on the 12th. In a few days, we killed more than 10,000 × ×, accounting for more than one-third of their total number. The number of beheadings set a new record for the results of battles in North China this year. In the western Shanxi area, the × had advanced in two routes from Zhongyang and Lishi, but the × army on the northern route did not make any progress, and the southern route was ambushed and counterattacked. We captured Liulin on the 10th and Tumen on the 11th, and once attacked Fencheng, killing at least 1,500 × in total! In Shandong, the × have been advancing in several routes towards Mengyin, Yishui, and Ju County since last week, and the momentum seems very fierce. However, our army used the mountainous terrain of Mount Tai to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the × bandits, and the number of beheadings was unprecedented in recent months. In the battle of Mengyin alone, more than 2,000 × were killed. Currently, the Shandong routes have re-entered [ ]. In addition, the situation in Hunan and Hubei continues to be stable, and the northwestern border of Guangdong is also very quiet. [ ] Jiang, Zengcheng, and Conghua have divided into three routes to attack Fuhe, Gonghe, and other places, but [ ]. In summary, the entire war situation is indeed increasingly approaching the stage of victory. There is news that the Japanese × army has launched another large-scale offensive, and northern Hunan and Chaozhou and Shantou are relatively tense, but in fact, there is not much to worry about. What we cannot fail to point out in particular is the actions of Wang Jingwei and others. Because the Japanese ×'s military invasion of China has reached serious difficulties, they have recently been actively carrying out political offensives, using military threats and intimidation against Britain as bait. The main focus of this political offensive is to divide the unity of our anti-Japanese front, undermine our country's cooperation with friendly countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, strengthen the rule of the occupied areas, and plunder our country's vast manpower and material resources in order to solve their difficulties. And all of this, Wang Jingwei and others and the "theories" and activities of the transformed Wang faction are directly and indirectly used by the Japanese ×. Therefore, after the National Government issued an arrest warrant for Wang Ming, we should intensify the struggle against Wang Ni's organization of a puppet central government and intensify the [ ] "rhetoric" of Wang Ni and other wavering elements and stubborn elements, making a ruthless struggle.</p>

<h3>The Great War Spreads to the Border Between Shanxi and Henan, The × Army Flees in Disarray on the North Bank of the Yellow River, More Than 30,000 × Are Wounded in the Battles of Hubei and Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Chongqing to this newspaper on the 17th] The total strength of the current × army in China is still 32 divisions, plus one division of Taiwanese soldiers and a portion of puppet soldiers. Its elite troops have been repeatedly lost, and some have been replenished more than ten times. The combat effectiveness is declining day by day, and it is trapped in difficulties on all battlefields. Furthermore, the nine divisions stationed in Manchukuo and the eight divisions in the country cannot be transferred. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to complete defeat. Therefore, it has recently used various means to try to end the war as soon as possible. But we will continue to strike at the × bandits based on the policy of resisting the war to the end. In the two battles of central Hubei and southwestern Shanxi, the × suffered a total of more than 32,000 casualties. Currently, the × bandits, except for harassing Shanxi and Shandong, are adopting a defensive posture.</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Xi'an to this newspaper on the 17th] The battle in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi is still fierce, and the × are continuing to reinforce their troops. The × seem to be attempting to concentrate all their strength and make a last-ditch effort. Our regular army and guerrillas in Shanxi are closely coordinated and have strong forces, and will surely crush the ×'s conspiracy. On both sides of the Zhang (Dian)-Mao (Jindu) highway, we annihilated the most ×.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram from Tongguan on the 16th] One regiment of the × artillery at Fenglingdu has been fiercely bombed by our army and air force for days, with more than half of them wounded or killed, and more than ten × cannons have been destroyed. In addition, 800 × trucks that departed from Yuncheng to Taiping and the buildings of the × in Yuncheng were completely destroyed by our air force. The × suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram from Quwo on the 16th] The ×, six or seven hundred in Xia County, with two cannons, have been constantly attacking our positions since the 14th. On the morning of the 16th, they attacked eastward in two routes from Shangjiaping and [ ] Jia Yao. Our army moved west from Wangjiaping to meet the attack, and at the same time launched a flank attack from Fanjiacha, Wangjiaping, and other places. The fierce battle lasted all day, and the artillery fire was fierce. The × were attacked from both sides by us, suffering heavy casualties. In the evening, they fled along the original road, abandoning many military supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram from Sian on the 13th] Military news. On the morning of the 13th, the × from Guwang, Zhangdian, and Taikuan attacked our line of Minjiagou and Dongchaicun in Guwang, carrying more than 30 cannons. The × launched four assaults, all of which were bravely repelled by us. More than a thousand × were killed on the entire line. The × then released a large amount of poison gas, especially in Guwang. In the afternoon, our Battalion Commander Wen Ying of the [ ] Division and all the officers and men of the battalion died heroically. As of the 14th, we were still continuing to fight fiercely east of Guwang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram from Shanzhou on the 16th] A part of the ×, about 200 in Chongyi (southwest of Qinyang in northern Henan), fled west to the vicinity of Fancun at 8 a.m. on the 12th. Our army launched a head-on attack, bravely pursuing and killing them. After a fierce battle of three hours, more than 80 × were killed. The × bandits, unable to withstand the attack, fled to Chongyi in a panic. We captured many military supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Telegram from Xingji on the 16th] There is no change in the situation with the × in western Shanxi. More than 100 × in Fencheng, with two cannons attached, moved to Fenyang on the 11th. We ambushed a part of our troops on the highlands at the western end of Fenyang City, and another part of our troops attacked the rear of the × by [ ] × ×. After the × passed by, we launched a surprise attack, killing 34 ×. The rest fled back to Fenyang.</p>

<h3>Probing Other Nations' Attitudes with the Tianjin Concession Incident; Attempting to Further Eliminate Foreigners' Rights and Interests in China; Both Sides Maintain a Strong Stance, Reaching a Stalemate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Following yesterday's cabinet meeting, the Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Finance Minister held another meeting. It is said that Japan's policy has been decided, considering that the Tianjin incident is not only related to the foreign concessions in that area but also involves Japan's fundamental policy toward foreign concessions in Shanghai, Gulangyu, and other places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, although the Japanese side has canceled the demonstration, the situation in the British concession remains extremely serious. According to a British resident with status, all British residents, in view of the seriousness of the situation and deeply concerned that the Tianjin incident will become a test of Japan's success in politically and economically dominating North China, are united in dealing with it. An editorial in the Tianjin Times stated that the Tianjin incident can no longer be regarded as a local incident, so the first point is to acknowledge this point to deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The British Consul-General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese Consul-General about the interference with the transport of food into the British concession.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The Japanese military commander here stated that the British concession authorities have repeatedly sought to talk, but all have been rejected, because "according to the current development of the situation, such a meeting is not necessary." The commander continued, stating that the development of the current situation is entirely against the pro-Chiang policy of Britain, so it is no longer a local incident. If Britain does not abandon its current policy, the incident will be difficult to resolve. If an economic blockade is to be implemented against Japan, the joint participation of the United States is indispensable, which is a very problematic matter.</p>
<p>The Situation on the Third Day</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, yesterday was the third day of the Japanese blockade of the concessions. The blockade measures have become even stricter, especially for Chinese residents. Very few Chinese residents were allowed to enter or leave the concessions. The important events that occurred yesterday were approximately: (1) Two Chinese vendors were arrested and shot by the Japanese army for carrying vegetables to the concessions through obstacles set up by the Japanese army. (2) The activities of anti-British agitators have become more active.</p>
<p>Residents at the southern end of the former German concession suddenly heard several gunshots in the early morning, coming from the obstacles set up by the Japanese army. Later, it was learned that two vendors were shot and killed by the Japanese army for delivering vegetables to the British concession, causing great shock. According to the Japanese side, the shooting of the two was to "warn" others not to do the same. Yesterday, some anti-British agitators, because their attempt to incite the people to rush into the concession the day before failed, went to several laundries in the former German concession that specialized in serving foreigners, insulted the owners and workers, and threw clothes on the ground. Regarding the food situation in the concessions, yesterday there was no better sign. Although the number of vegetables sold in the market was more than the day before, the price was expensive and the quality was poor, and there was no room for choice when buying. A small number of cattle were transported into the concession yesterday, but it was still far from enough. British residents felt inconvenienced in the previous two days, so they decided not to leave the concession yesterday, so no events related to British residents occurred yesterday. The Japanese army did not seem to insult German and Italian residents. After the Japanese strengthened its blockade measures, it dealt a major blow to the Chinese people in the concessions, because most of those who wanted to enter and leave worked and made a living in the concessions. According to eyewitnesses, yesterday morning some workers wanted to enter the concession, but as a result, they were transported by Japanese military trucks to other places to work for the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The Situation on the Fourth Day</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shanghai, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, the situation today remains in a stalemate. (1) A parade by pro-Japanese residents into the concession, originally one of the intimidating steps, has been automatically canceled today. (2) The supply of food and ice in the concession has become a serious problem. (3) The inspection of those entering and leaving the concession is extremely strict, and foreigners are particularly provoked and harassed, even the White Russians of the "Anti-Communist Association" are not exempt. (4) Two parts of the British concession were also blockaded starting today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, the food situation in the concessions is deteriorating. The Japanese army patrols the river in front of the former German concession on motorboats, preventing people from transporting vegetables to the concessions. The Japanese side has also implemented strict inspections near the boundary of the concessions, so that various grains cannot be transported into the concessions. The temperature here has reached about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Japanese army prohibits the transport of ice into the concession, which is extremely inconvenient for the residents. Also, although the British Consul-General made a strong protest to the Japanese side on the 15th, the Japanese army continued to rigorously search British residents. Reuters has learned that yesterday a British gentleman wanted to pass through the International Bridge to go to his office, but the Japanese army ordered him to stand at the end of the line waiting for inspection. The gentleman's ID was ineffective. When it came to his turn for inspection, the Japanese army ordered him to stand at the end of the line again, repeating this twice. Finally, a Chinese policeman suggested letting him go, but a Japanese sentry insisted that those who arrived later should pass before the gentleman was allowed to pass.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, members of the Tianjin White Russian Anti-Communist Committee were also thoroughly searched by the Japanese army today. Anyone entering or leaving the Special Area No. 1 was forced to take off all their clothes and obey the inspection, which was carried out entirely by the Japanese army. Even with credentials, the White Russians were not exempt from being searched.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tokyo sources, the Japanese army "reservists" and Japanese residents in Tianjin originally planned to hold a parade through the British concession today, but after the advice of the Japanese military authorities, they have canceled their original plan. The paraders planned to hold a memorial service today at the tomb of Japanese soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The food supply in Tianjin has rapidly become a serious problem. The Japanese are now deploying patrol boats on the river, facing the former German concession occupied by Japan, with the aim of preventing all boats from transporting vegetables to the British and French concessions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The Japanese side also implemented a strict blockade on the southern border of the British concession today, resulting in the cutoff of all traffic. The ban now includes ice, and the prohibition of ice transport is particularly serious in this hot weather.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The situation in the British concession remains calm today. It is reported that the Taikoo Dockyard Company sent a tugboat to Tanggu yesterday, carrying one passenger. The ship was inspected en route. According to a bank leader, commerce has completely stopped, with only some trading between banks and some foreign exchange transactions. Importers and exporters also say they have nothing to do all day. However, according to a stockbroker, the market has turned better due to the slight depreciation of the legal tender. It is generally believed that everything here has been suspended, preparing for war, with no signs of failure, but everyone is paying attention to how long it can last. According to very reliable sources, the Yokohama Specie Bank has notified German stores that if they can establish themselves outside the concession and provide written assurance that they will not transport goods into the concession, they are willing to conduct business with them. It is said that as of now, at least one company has agreed to this method.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Pro-Japanese Authorities Also Provoke the Concessions; Tensions Run High on Great Western Road; British Troops and Puppet Police Face Each Other in a Standoff</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to sources in Shanghai, the British military authorities of the Public Concession reopened the police station belonging to the "Great Way Municipal Government" on Great Western Road, which had been closed three months ago. It was closed again by the British authorities that night. This morning, the "Great Way" police removed the power grid and seals. Upon hearing this, the British military authorities dispatched a large troop to Great Western Road to guard the area, and reinstalled the power grid. The "Great Way" police retreated into the Japanese-occupied area, with only a few police officers patrolling the border area. The British troops withdrew at 2:20 PM. The "Great Way" police then invaded Great Western Road, carrying rifles and handguns, but did not remove the iron nets installed by the British troops. At 4:10 PM, a large number of municipal police officers and a British troop rushed to Great Western Road again. It is said that the attitude of the "Great Way" police is quite sinister, and some neutral observers fear that the Japanese side will use this incident as an excuse to blockade Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Shanghai sources, the puppet city police station at the corner of Great Western Road and Columbia Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads Area was closed by British troops on January 5th. On the evening of the 16th, several puppet city police officers moved into it. At 9:00 AM on the 17th, they were expelled by British troops again.</p>
<h3>Special Correspondent's Report: Luofu Travelogue (4)</h3>
<p>— Firefly</p>
<p>Old Ashes · New Bloodstains</p>
<p>Changning, like Longhua, has a town of dozens of shops completely burned down, the only difference being the time. Changning was burned down by the Fascist "civilized fire" when Boluo fell last year. The scorched smell is not as strong as Longhua's.</p>
<p>We arrived at Changning and ate breakfast a few houses away from the charred street, to the north. Apart from two houses that still operated as tea houses, one served as the township office and two were full of soldiers.</p>
<p>If the face of Luofu Mountain is south-facing—the sunny side of Luofu is Changning. No, Changning is in the embrace of Luofu, closest to the beauty of the mountain. Looking behind the town, the true face of Luofu is revealed, with Chongxu Guan, Huashou Platform, and Huanglong Guan all visible.</p>
<p>During our meal, Japanese planes circled twice. All the soldiers and civilians were very calm, and not a single tea drinker in the tea house fled.</p>
<p>This was less of a breakfast and more of a lunch, because it was already 12 o'clock after the meal. We hurried along a small road to Futian, where we received the following military news: "The ×× Detachment retreated to Dazuo Tang via Jiu Tan last night. The ×× Battalion also arrived at Lan Shi." Some comrades were worried, thinking that there were no troops of ours on the front line, but five li from Futian, Commander Chen had sent several brothers to greet us and told us the location of the regimental headquarters, asking us to rest and stay at the regimental headquarters. He also told us about the bombing of Futian by Japanese planes just now. The brother pointed to the mountains and forests where the bombs had fallen, and his every word and action showed anger and vigilance. Then six soldiers, two civilians, and an armed comrade met us. They were the people injured by the invaders, covered in blood, with bloodstains all along the way. Here, blood seemed even more glorious and great.</p>
<p>Unable to refuse Commander Chen's kindness, we carried the comfort items to Lizhidun, distributed them to some comrades, and sent a few representatives to the regimental headquarters to meet Commander Chen. Commander Chen was a young military officer with a robust body and straightforward manner. He was Chen Bonan's nephew and could be called the son of a general. After a brief greeting, we decided to hold a meaningful military-civilian get-together in the evening.</p>
<h3>Military Report by He Yingqin at the Central Memorial Week Ceremony; Proving Victory in the War with Battle Statistics and Confirming Success in Development and Nation-Building</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing] The Central Party Headquarters held a weekly memorial ceremony on the 12th. Committee Member He Yingqin delivered a speech. The original text is as follows: Chairman, comrades, after the Battle of Nanchang, in order to continue to exhaust the enemy and prevent them from having any time to rest and reorganize, in April, the troops in each war zone continuously launched attacks on the enemy facing them. The guerrilla troops in various occupied areas also echoed the regular army, intensifying attacks, sabotage, and disturbances behind enemy lines, all of which were able to inflict decisive blows on the enemy. Especially the counterattacks in Nanchang, Gao'an, and Wuning, the counterattacks in the Guangdong-Guangxi-East River-North Jiang-West Jiang areas, and the surprise attacks in the Kaifeng and Anqing areas forced the enemy to run around, unable to cope, with elite troops destroyed and losses extremely high, and their westward advance was completely shattered by us. In total, the results of our army's battles in April, based only on written reports that can be statistically compiled, are as follows: (1) Number of battles: 827; (2) Enemy killed: 53,846; (3) Enemy and puppet soldiers captured: 1,068; (4) Horses captured: 774; (5) Rifles captured: 2,013; (6) Machine guns captured: 99; (7) Artillery pieces captured: 25; (8) Armored vehicles destroyed and captured: 171; (9) Ammunition captured: 68,934; (10) Enemy warships sunk or damaged: 11; (11) Enemy planes shot down: 12; (12) Kilometers of highways destroyed: 104; (13) Kilometers of railways destroyed: 90; (14) Towns and villages recovered: 3,787.</p>
<p>"The May Offensive" was the period during which the enemy planned to attack us, so the battles in each war zone in May were more intense than before. Especially in the Battle of Southern Henan and Northern Hubei, the enemy used three infantry divisions and one cavalry regiment, intending to find our main force in that area and destroy it in one fell swoop. They even broadcast and publicized this in advance, saying that several of our divisions had fallen into their encirclement and would be annihilated in a few days. Unexpectedly, they were met with fierce resistance from our army and suffered a head-on blow. Xinye, Tanghe, Zaoyang, and Suixian were successively recovered by us. Because the enemy was surrounded by us on all sides, they had to retreat hastily to Anlu, Jingshan, Zhongxiang, and the surrounding areas. In this battle, more than 10,000 enemies were killed, and many were captured.</p>
<p>The enemy corpses left on the battlefield and the wounded soldiers were piled up and could not be buried or rescued. The miserable situation they were in can be imagined. In total, the results of the battles on all fronts in this month are as follows: (1) Number of battles: 838; (2) Enemy killed: 51,891; (3) Enemy and puppet soldiers captured: 486; (4) Horses killed: 836; (5) Rifles captured: 1,587; (6) Machine guns captured: 183; (7) Artillery pieces captured: 13; (8) Armored vehicles destroyed and captured: 272; (9) Ammunition captured: 67,748; (10) Enemy warships sunk or damaged: 18; (11) Enemy planes shot down: 24; (12) Kilometers of highways destroyed: 107; Kilometers of railways destroyed: 36.</p>
<p>From the battle situation in these recent two months, we can see that (1) the enemy's attacking spirit has weakened compared to before; (2) if the enemy leaves the communication lines, both movement and supply become difficult; (3) the consumption of soldiers is too great, and replenishment is not easy (from July 7, 1937, to the first half of May of this year, the total number of enemy casualties was 864,500); (4) this invasion of China is without justification and is a protracted war with no success. The officers and soldiers' thoughts of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are becoming more and more intense; (5) the war expenditure over the past two years has been too high, cash has been exhausted, public bonds cannot be digested, the economy is collapsing, and resources are scarce. The people in their country deeply feel the pain of living under pressure, and their thoughts of resisting the war are also becoming increasingly strong, and there have been repeated demonstrations of action. Based on these various reasons, we know that the enemy is probably feeling unable to cope with the current war. A quick battle and quick resolution is impossible, and a quick peace and quick resolution is also impossible. On the other hand, since the beginning of our country's war of resistance two years ago, the quality and quantity of the army have become stronger as we fight. After each battle, the army undergoes a reorganization, and everything from weapons, ammunition, equipment, grain, transportation, communication, and sanitation is enriched and improved according to the requirements of actual combat. In terms of education, in various military schools and temporary training classes, training is also intensified in order to cultivate a large number of sound cadres at all levels.</p>
<p>As for the issue of soldier replenishment, we are also thinking about ways to improve it day by day. In the existing military districts, in addition to the source of conscription quotas being continuously collected, many young men in various places voluntarily enlist early, which shows that the national concept of resisting the enemy and defending the country is increasing among the people, and the psychology of common hatred and resistance is deepening. This cannot but be attributed to the efforts and propaganda of the comrades of our party, as well as the efforts of all levels of government and national military service personnel, before such an effect can be achieved.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the second phase of the war, our guerrilla forces in all directions have been able to exert their strength, frequently attacking behind the enemy lines and assisting the regular army in combat, so as to achieve the effects of dispersing, containing, disrupting, and exhausting the enemy. For several months, the enemy in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan has felt deeply threatened and has assembled several divisions to try to wipe out our guerrilla forces, but the result has been a waste of military force with no gains, giving our army the opportunity to disperse and annihilate the enemy. In the future, as long as our regular army and guerrilla forces can effectively cooperate and coordinate their actions, constantly striking the enemy at any time and place, preventing them from achieving their goals of economic exploitation and plunder in our occupied areas, and as long as our party comrades and compatriots across the country can unite under the unified national policy of our party and government to work hard in production and construction, so that all wartime materials can be self-sufficient, gradually reaching the point where we do not have to rely on foreigners, then the longer the war lasts, the faster the enemy will collapse, and the day of the final victory of the war of resistance will be the day of the success of nation-building. At the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee this year, the President once told us, "Our future will indeed inevitably have many difficulties, but after the War of Resistance enters the second phase, we are confident that the war situation will inevitably become more and more smooth day by day, and closer and closer to the light. The problem is whether we have an indomitable, long-term, and sustained spirit, and whether we have the efforts of the whole country to unite and fight harder." The President also said, "We believe that the work of resisting the war and building the country has no time limit. If it is not completed in five years, then ten years. If it is not completed in ten years, then a hundred years. We will not stop until the goal is achieved." Comrades, let us all follow the President's instructions and strive towards the bright path of victory and success.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point. Recently, enemy planes often fly to the rear for indiscriminate bombing, which shows that the enemy has no way to do anything on the front lines. On the one hand, they want to shake the hearts of the people in our rear, and on the other hand, they want to destroy our rear construction. But it is counterproductive. Under the enemy's policy of terror and massacre, our people across the country only strengthen their determination to avenge their shame and strengthen their determination to sacrifice for the country, and are not shaken in the slightest by the enemy's bombing, nor do they stop construction work because of the enemy's destruction. This is a great psychological progress of our compatriots across the country since the war of resistance, and it is beyond the enemy's expectations. We must always maintain this progress, resist the war to the end, and achieve the ultimate and greatest victory. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Protest, Japan Has Not Yet Replied, British Government Gazette Continues to Warn, Cabinet to Discuss Retaliation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The British Consul-General in Tianjin previously lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese army's search of British nationals and other incidents related to the blockade of the concession. No reply has yet been received from the Japanese side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The British Cabinet will meet next Monday at Downing Street to consider the situation in Tianjin. It is reported that the various departments responsible for studying the issue will submit reports for review. The most important of these concerns what economic measures Britain should take if the blockade situation continues.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The British government has issued the following official statement regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the Tianjin concession: "The cause of the Tianjin incident was the shooting of a Chinese national in the British concession of Tianjin on April 9. Subsequently, the Japanese side demanded the extradition of four Chinese nationals they claimed were suspects. The British authorities maintained that they could not hand over the four Chinese nationals currently detained at the Municipal Council Police Station to the 'local court' without sufficient evidence being presented. However, the Japanese side resolutely refused to provide evidence. Later, the British authorities agreed to submit the case to an independent advisory committee composed of three reputable local figures and a neutral chairman for judgment. The Japanese side could send representatives to attend the committee, and the United States also agreed to appoint a representative to participate. The purpose of the above-mentioned committee was to determine whether the evidence presented was sufficient and constituted grounds for extradition. The British government had already prepared to accept any decision of the committee. However, the Japanese side acted unilaterally and blockaded the British and French concessions. Therefore, this proposal was not agreed to by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. However, the British proposal to provide evidence to the advisory committee for a decision has not been withdrawn. At the same time, the Japanese authorities in China issued serious statements, making various excessive demands. The British, American, and French governments recently believed that it was necessary to lodge a protest with Tokyo regarding the remarks made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24, which seriously threatened foreign treaty rights in China. Later, a spokesperson in Tianjin issued a statement, the content of which was even more threatening than the remarks of the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. From these statements, it is clear that the British refusal to extradite the four Chinese nationals was not the main reason for the Japanese side's adoption of opposing measures against the British concession. Their demand was actually: 'The British authorities should cooperate with Japan to build a new order in East Asia and abandon their pro-China policy, which includes no longer protecting anti-Japanese communists, no longer sacrificing counterfeit banknotes of the Prepared Bank to support Chinese legal tender, no longer cutting off goods, no longer tolerating illegal elements using wireless radio, and prohibiting the use of anti-Japanese textbooks in the concession.' The British side cannot but view this further extensive demand from Japan, which affects all countries enjoying treaty rights in China, as a most serious matter. The aim of the Japanese demand is obviously to force the British government and other countries with interests in the Far East to abandon their consistent past policies by violence. The British government still hopes that the Japanese authorities will not insist on their refusal to consider the British proposal, so that this incident is limited to localization. However, unfortunately, if the Japanese officials in North China insist on the new demands they have put forward, it will inevitably lead to an extremely serious situation, and the British government will also consider all the most direct and effective steps to protect British interests in China."</p>
<p>America Closely Watches, Gaida Scathingly Criticizes Japan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Today, at a press briefing, U.S. Secretary of State Hull reported that foreign concessions in Tianjin have begun to feel the pain of the blockade. Hull released the contents of a report from U.S. Consul Caldwell, which stated that the concessions felt a severe lack of food such as milk and vegetables. Hull stated that he is currently awaiting detailed reports from the ambassadors to China and Japan in order to decide what additional measures should be taken beyond the attitude expressed by the chargé d'affaires in Japan, Norman, on Thursday. The State Department has also received a report from the U.S. Consul in Xiamen, stating that the Japanese side has also implemented a food blockade of the Gulangyu Public Concession. According to the consul, the situation is not yet serious due to sufficient storage, but it will inevitably become serious in the future. Caldwell reported that, as of now, the U.S. Consul in Tianjin has not received any reports of U.S. nationals encountering severe detentions or American goods being interfered with. A reporter immediately asked, based on the British announcement that the United States had agreed to appoint a representative to participate in the mediation committee in Tianjin, to which Hull replied that he had no particularly new information to report on the matter. Another reporter then urged Hull to pay attention to a sentence in the British statement, which stated that accepting the Japanese demands would be tantamount to abandoning the policies that the British Empire and other powers had insisted on in the Far East in the face of armed intimidation. Hull replied that the State Department was paying close attention to all the important developments in the overall situation but still needed to continue observing further developments in order to decide everything.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 16th] Italian official commentator Gaida issued a clear statement today, saying that some people in Italy regard the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession as damaging the treaty rights of European powers in China and as a preliminary action to expel European interests from East Asia. Gaida wrote in 'Italian Newspaper' that "If the entire issue of the position of European powers in China arises as a result, Italy will come forward to compete with the powers for equal rights. When the Japanese authorities in Shanghai suggested reconsidering the Shanghai Public Concession in order to cope with the new situation, the Italian Consul-General in Shanghai had already explained Italy's principles in this regard."</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Debate, Expansion of Military Issue, British General Staff Headquarters, Currently in Talks With Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] During a debate in the House of Lords this afternoon on the issue of military expansion, Liberal Party member Lord Stonehaven first spoke, saying that it was inappropriate for Britain and France to continue to supply the Axis powers with scrap iron and other metals. For now, British autonomous territories should reach an agreement to limit the export of various raw materials that could assist the German and Italian governments' military preparations. Labor Party member Lord Strabolgi also spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with the matter, and said that today's events in Asia were far more influential on world peace than events in Europe. The British government has now taken various measures and should work with French friends to deal with difficulties. Although it is late, it is not too late. Our General Staff should strengthen contact with the General Staffs of allied countries. Regarding the events occurring in Asia, we know that it is necessary to cooperate with possible allies. It is gratifying to read in the newspaper that a French naval delegation will travel to Singapore, and a British military delegation will also travel to French Indochina. Minister for Coordination of Defence Admiral Chatfield then gave a speech, concluding the debate, briefly stating that the relationship between the British and allied countries holding General Staff talks is important. This matter is currently underway and will continue to be pursued. The British military talks with various allied countries are after the military talks between Germany and Italy. The progress is naturally inferior to the German-Italian talks. Our expansion of armaments in peacetime is nothing more than to be prepared for war when it breaks out. This standard of armaments will soon be reached.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield said in a speech in the House of Lords yesterday that Britain's war plan is more thorough than ever before, especially in terms of air defense. The number of British fighter planes is gradually increasing, so that they can intercept enemy planes in the shortest possible time. For several years, the government will send experts to various places to inspect and study what necessary measures the authorities should take for air defense.</p>
<h3>British King Returns Home, Roosevelt Sends Telegram to Say Farewell</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] According to a report from the Reuters special correspondent on the 'Queen Mary', U.S. President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to say farewell to the British King and Queen. The telegram reads as follows: "Your Majesties' visit to our country has given us great pleasure. As we part, I sincerely cannot but express our happiness again. Your Majesties have deeply received the warm welcome of the people throughout the United States. This is truly a natural expression of the American people, which is due to Your Majesties' benevolence. I am extremely pleased to think that Your Majesties feel the friendship of the American people. I wish you a comfortable journey." The 'Queen Mary' is now proceeding quickly in clear weather, but encountered a small fog this morning.</p>
<h3>After British and American Submarine Accidents, French Submarine Also Missing, Sunk During Exercise in Vietnamese Waters, French Navy Dispatched But Still Has Not Found</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] According to a telegram from Saigon, the French submarine 'Phoenix', carrying a crew of sixty, has not been seen to surface thirty hours after diving. Although there is no direct official news to confirm this, there is reason to believe that this news is reliable. It is expected that the Ministry of the Navy will issue a formal communique late at night. It is believed that the missing submarine was lost while patrolling the coast of Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] According to the latest news from Saigon, after the submarine 'Phoenix' failed to surface at the scheduled time, the commander of the French Far East Fleet immediately ordered all warships and seaplanes stationed at Vietnamese naval ports to conduct a search, but to no avail. It is believed that after the submarine went underwater, it lost its balance for some reason, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea. The French Ministry of the Navy has just issued a communique, expressing concern about the fate of the 'Phoenix' submarine currently stationed in Vietnam. The communique stated, "The 'Phoenix' submarine has not been seen to resurface since diving into the water in Cam Ranh Bay on the morning of the 15th of this month. The French fleet in the Far East immediately began a search. The search is still in progress, and seaplanes are also participating. The headquarters has notified the families of the personnel on the 'Phoenix' submarine of this situation."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] After the disappearance of the French submarine 'Phoenix', despite extensive searches, its location has still not been found. French President Lebrun is extremely concerned about this incident. He had originally planned to host the King of Morocco today, but has now temporarily canceled it. (Hong Kong News) At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Hong Kong received a telegram from Vietnam stating that the French first-class submarine, the 'Phoenix', had sunk in the Cam Ranh Bay waters. It is reported that the ship and its sister ship, the 'Le Heros', belong to the French Far East Fleet and recently departed from the West with the destination of Hong Kong, expected to arrive within two weeks. The 'Phoenix' was conducting diving exercises along the way. On Thursday, it sailed to the Cam Ranh Bay waters of Vietnam, which is a world-renowned, beautiful, and deepest harbor, with a water depth of more than 300 feet. The ship sailed to the area and conducted diving exercises. Usually, the exercise time is two hours of diving before resurfacing. However, the ship somehow had an accident, and after 30 hours, it still had not resurfaced, nor had it sent a telegram report. It is generally believed that the ship has met with disaster. The sister ship, 'Le Heros', knew that an accident had occurred six hours after diving in the area and immediately searched for it, but without any news, it sent a telegram to report to all parties. French ships and seaplanes stationed in Vietnam immediately set off to investigate, but after a long period of search, the sinking location of the ship was still not discovered. The 'Phoenix' has a displacement of 12,384 tons and has four senior officers and fifty-nine soldiers on board. The captain is Mr. Bouchart, who is a famous figure in the French naval circles and has repeatedly made achievements. It is reported that the French Navy has a total of 30 such new-style submarines, with four of them stationed in the Far East, the 'Phoenix', 'Le Heros', 'Colossus'.</p>
<h3>German Ships Exercise, Damage Norwegian Fishing Nets, Will Demand Compensation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Oslo, 16th] It is reported that about 100 German ships were exercising off the Skagerrak in the North Sea, with aircraft participating. Norwegian fishermen said that many of their fishing nets were destroyed and have reported to the Norwegian government, saying that they will demand compensation.</p>
<h3>War Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>America Asks Germany, Germany Refuses to Acknowledge</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] A mixed commission organized by the United States ruled that Germany should compensate for a loss of $50 million during a time. A semi-official statement was released today, stating that "The German government finds it difficult to recognize this ruling." At the same time, German political figures also said, "This commission has no German representatives, and its judgment is obviously biased against Germany, so it does not conform to the procedures that should be adopted," expressing their resentment.</p>
<h3>Papal Representative Visits Polish Authorities, Conducts Mediation of German-Polish Disputes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 17th] Papal representative Cortesi visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck yesterday and the day before, and this morning he again visited the Polish president. It is reported that Cortesi made a proposal to Beck, which was the Pope's response to Mussolini's request to continue mediation in order to peacefully resolve the German-Polish dispute.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes, Severe Penalties for Spies, Some Countries Send People to U.S., Sabotage U.S. Defense Plans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Senate Naval Committee recently passed an anti-espionage bill, which stipulates that anyone who spies on U.S. military secrets in peacetime may be sentenced to imprisonment for five to twenty years. It is said that other countries (several of which are possible enemies of the United States) have now sent more spies to the United States to spy on U.S. military secrets, or even sabotage U.S. defense plans.</p>
<h3>Germany, Italy, Japan, Plan Merchant Shipping Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] Relevant parties are now starting a plan to enable the merchant ships of Germany, Italy, and Japan to cooperate with each other. The method is for Germany to designate 75,000 tons of merchant ships to transport grain from the Black Sea and east of the Black Sea to Trieste. Italy will be responsible for transportation from Italy to Austria and Czechoslovakia. Japanese shipping companies will cooperate with Italian shipping companies to guarantee shipping between the Adriatic Sea and Japan and Northern Europe.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Negotiations, Proceeding Smoothly, Talks Held Yesterday and the Day Before, No Joint Statement Yet Issued by Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] A telegram from Moscow says that the British-Soviet negotiations are proceeding smoothly, with no reason for pessimism. As for the Far East issue, it is not within the scope of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Office expert Strang, and the British and French ambassadors held a meeting at the Kremlin this afternoon lasting one hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting, Strang and the British and French ambassadors met again at the British Embassy. Afterwards, according to Strang, further talks may be held on Saturday.</p>
<p>[Haito News Agency, Moscow, 16th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received British envoy Strang and the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union at the Kremlin today. The meeting lasted for more than an hour. The results of the meeting were not released in an official statement. As far as is generally known, everything remains unchanged in terms of substance. It is reported that Molotov will do everything possible to urge the British and French ambassadors to provide further letters of understanding, and then the Soviet Foreign Minister can reply on behalf of the Soviet government and force the British and French to agree to the Soviet demands. It is heard that the main dispute is still the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries.</p>
<h3>Shantou City Under the Cloud of War</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Bai Wei</p>
<p>The several blasts of the steam whistle carried the New Haimen Wheel away from Hong Kong, heading for Shantou.</p>
<p>Out of Lei Yue Mun, the waves of the sea surge endlessly, silvery snow-like waves burst out in one impact after another, and disappear in one descent after another. These are the waves of the Pacific Ocean, invisibly portraying the microcosm of this Pacific Ocean. We feel that although every wave crashes into our boat, affecting our boat to teeter uncertainly; but, as long as we are firm in our will and confidence, we will always break through the waves of the sea. Perhaps some waves are even the propulsive force of our boat. From sailing to experience the international situation on the Pacific Ocean, it is truly enough to make people optimistic about China's self-reliance in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Around midnight, a great wind and rain arose. The roar of the wind夹着the sound of the rustling rain sounded like a horse neighing a machine, hitting the boat and making strange noises. The reporter silently calculated the voyage, which was probably already along the coast of the Dong River. The Dong River is the work area that the reporter is about to leave, and also the location of a perfect home. There, I have seen the bloodstains after the trampling of the x people, I have seen the cruel behavior of the x people, and I have even seen the heroic posture of thousands of loyal guerrilla fighters and the people struggling. The reporter hopes to see the winding coastline of the Dong River from the glass. But it was already covered by the black night, only arousing a trace of nostalgia and other hatreds. However, the safety of eastern Guangdong and the Dong River is related to fate; no, the entire China is also related to fate. Today, the concept of hometown and family should be broadly defined!</p>
<p>Departed from Hong Kong at 4:00 PM on the 11th and arrived in Shantou at 8:00 AM the next morning, a voyage of 16 hours. Originally, this route was declared by the × naval to be under ordinary blockade, but fortunately, this time, it did not suffer the inspection of the × ship harassment. Only when approaching the sea entrance of Shantou, in the hazy color, I saw about one or two shadows of warships, which are said to be × ships. In fact, with the extension of the Chinese sea , attempting to strictly blockade is simply a dream of the × naval, not to mention that in the current complex situation in the Far East, it also contains the question of international rights and interests? Look at the future results of this time × people blockading nine ports such as Zhejiang and Fujian, and you can make a few white facts.</p>
<p>Entering the harbor of Shantou, I looked at the sea surface. The entire eye is full of British ships. More than a dozen merchant ships of Taikoo, Java, and Jardine Matheson are lined up like a team. Next to them, there are also two or three small British gunboats. From this, it can be seen again that the interests of the British Far East shipping industry are in China. Chatting with the sailors on the ship, I learned that after the × I war broke out; cargo transportation has been reduced by half, and this time the blockade of nine ports is even more fragmented. At the same time, the bombs of the × people's aircraft, and the muzzles of the warships, did not turn their direction because of the British Empire flag logo, and still continued to be thrown towards (referring to the ships). In order to solve the misfortune of the British Far East shipping industry, I am afraid that it is not enough to escort with a few gunboats. We should fundamentally seek how to suppress aggression and stabilize the situation in the Far East. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Five Hundred Thousand Letters of Condolence</h3>
<p>Recently, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Social Department, the Chongqing Municipal Party Department, and the National Comforting Association have jointly launched a campaign to collect 500,000 comforting letters by June 30 and distribute them to the soldiers at the front. This is a very meaningful movement. On the one hand, it can encourage the soldiers at the front to produce more victories, and on the other hand, it can promote our general people's respect for the soldiers at the front and enhance our mood of supporting the long-term war of resistance and striving for final victory.</p>
<p>From the number of our vast rear area and overseas Chinese, the result of recruiting 500,000 comforting letters must exceed expectations. Even in this port, the number of compatriots is more than one million? Who is willing to be excluded from the heart of worrying about the national disaster? The act of comforting should be the first! What's more, it's just a matter of writing a stroke? The Life Bookstore is ordered to collect these letters on behalf of them. May all gentlemen and women not miss the last three days of opportunity!</p>
<h3>Congratulations on the Opening of the China Righteous School</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong and Kowloon China Righteous Schools are scheduled to open at 1:00 PM today, with opening ceremonies held separately in each . We would like to express our national wishes to this.</p>
<p>The China Righteous School was established by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association to relieve out-of-school refugee children and unemployed teachers. As the name suggests, we deeply hope that the gentlemen in charge will always and everywhere save the vitality of the Chinese nation and cultivate excellent new forces to prepare for the survival and independence of the country and nation in the future. Moreover, today, teachers and students get along in a hall, and since we are concerned about the suffering of these thousands of artillery fires, we should never forget the great shame and great hatred of our country's national dust. In the past, King Goujian of Yue led the people of Yue, gathered together for ten years, and taught for ten years, and finally flooded Wu. I hope you, gentlemen, will not be complacent, learn from the sages, and strive for the glory of the nation!</p>
<p>Furthermore, a total of more than 6,000 students are registered in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macao this time, and the school buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon can currently only accommodate more than 4,000 people. In addition, there are a considerable number of unemployed teachers who have not been hired. On the one hand, we hope that schools will generously help to lend school buildings, and on the other hand, we hope that those who are in charge of this work will continue to work hard and seriously select true talents.</p>

<h3>Roes Talk, Temporarily Does Not Answer to Any Agreement, Only Promotes Balkan Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Haito News Agency, Athens, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday. Local newspapers commented on Gafenco's trip, saying that the Balkan countries are fully aware that there is no dispute with any country in Europe. The Romanian Foreign Minister's visit to Athens is not for negotiating and concluding agreements, but to assist in promoting cooperation among the Balkan countries.</p>

<h3>One Person a Day</h3>
<p>Jin Shengtan</p>
<p>"Marginal Commentary Expert" Jin Shengtan, although talented, his fortune in the marketplace was not very prosperous. When he was young, he traveled tirelessly, rushing to take exams every year, but, alas, fate, fortune, he failed repeatedly. Once, he went to take the autumn exam again, the topic was "A Western Beauty." Old Jin thought that this topic was just right for him, and this time he was sure to pass the talent exam. He wrote quickly, composing ten thousand words. Who knew that after writing his great essay, his thoughts surged again, and he added a wonderful poem at the end of the essay, also circling it with a secret mark. The poem said:</p>
<p>"Going out the east gate, Western Beauty does not come;</p>
<p>Going out the south gate, Western Beauty does not come;</p>
<p>Going out the north gate, Western Beauty does not come;</p>
<p>Going out the west gate, will Western Beauty come! Will Western Beauty come!"</p>
<p>The chief examiner looked at the paper, the essay was not bad, but too deviant. He also wrote a poem in response, saying:</p>
<p>"To place it in the first rank, is unreasonable;</p>
<p>To place it in the second rank, is unreasonable;</p>
<p>To place it in the third rank, is unreasonable;</p>
<p>To place it in the fourth rank, a talent's fate, the talent departs."</p>
<h3>Rare News</h3>
<p>King Carol of Romania has a nineteen-year-old son who graduated from a French middle school this spring. He was not born to the current Queen of Romania. Back in 1918, when Carol was still the Crown Prince, he privately engaged himself to the daughter of a soldier named Rabino. But a year later, the royal family did not recognize this marriage, and the court ruled it dissolved, with annual alimony of five thousand yuan. Less than five months after the divorce, this little prince was born. He was raised by his mother and is now named Prince Carol Mircea. Of course, this title is only recognized by his mother.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Windsor recently wrote a pair of letters to her close friend in London, saying: I have been away from England for so long, their—the people's—impression of me should have faded a little. Also, the British King and Queen have recently gotten closer to America, and Anglo-American relations seem to be very good. Do you think I can return to England soon?</p>

<p>The weather today will probably not be bad; although the ancients said it well: "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and man has fortune and misfortune overnight."</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, there was a big fight in Causeway Bay. According to newspaper descriptions, it was: "More than three hundred members of the Triad Society attacked Da Hang Village, with fierce momentum, beating people upon sight. The villagers united with more than a thousand people to fight back, and finally repelled the thugs." What a magnificent war "special," its grandeur, passion, and greatness are truly difficult to distinguish from the "Battle of Taierzhuang." But, what was it all for? It is said to be for "forcing children to join the society." Isn't that an astonishing thing?</p>
<p>Hong Kong prohibits smoking. No one would have thought there would be opium dens, but yesterday there were "four big hooligans impersonating police detectives, searching and robbing a new landfill opium den." Isn't this another strange thing? Robbers are getting more and more fierce, daring to impersonate police officers. Private opium dens,</p>

<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>It is said that one day, King Yama fell ill and sent two little devils to Yangjian (the world of the living) to find a doctor. Before they left, he repeatedly instructed them:</p>
<p>"The doctors in Yangjian are not necessarily all reliable. You only need to choose those who have fewer ghosts following them. Because if there are fewer ghosts following them, it means that they have killed fewer people, and their skills must be excellent."</p>
<p>The little devils obeyed and went, and after a long time, they brought back a doctor to report:</p>
<p>"There are many doctors in the world of the living, but there are also many ghosts following them. It was very difficult to find this famous doctor, who only had one ghost following him. So we brought him here."</p>
<p>King Yama looked at the doctor's back, and sure enough, there was only one ghost following him, so he asked:</p>
<p>"May I ask how long you have been practicing medicine?"</p>
<p>"I am of little talent and learning, and I have been practicing medicine for more than twenty years."</p>
<p>"Ah, you truly deserve to be called a famous doctor. You have only killed one person in more than twenty years."</p>
<p>"To be honest, great king, my fate has been unfortunate. Since I started practicing, this is only the second time someone has come to ask for my services!"</p>
<h3>Sea Adventures 6</h3>
<p>— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>Previous summary</p>
<p>In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the American steamship "Kelongboqi" carried six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Qiu Kesi Company's radio operator Jack and mechanic Bill also took this ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met French aviator Lu Mengjialuo and the ship's German radio operator Bofu. While Jack was working for Daibao, he received a strange message saying that England and Germany had declared war, and a British warship was coming to intercept the ship. Jack accepted the captain's invitation and also became the ship's radio operator...</p>
<p>"Do you know? We are trying to escape the clutches of a British cruiser." Erlnanno spoke nervously and seriously.</p>
<p>"I knew it before the ship turned around." Jack said calmly, "But at that time, because it was top secret, I wouldn't even tell you; but now there's no need to hide it anymore." He told Bill what had just happened. Just as they were talking, a sailor came in.</p>
<p>He told them that the radio room door should be closed tightly, and the vents should also be covered so that no light could be seen from the outside. In the darkness, even the tiniest ray of light would let the British cruiser know their whereabouts. The passengers on the ship also received the same notice. The stewards were busy everywhere covering the vents with blankets. By ten o'clock, except for some working parts—where they carefully sealed the lights inside—there was no light at all on the entire ship.</p>
<p>Because they were afraid that some people would not obey orders, the captain ordered the circuit breakers for some of the cabin lights to be turned off. At this time, on the pitch-black deck, there were small groups of timid passengers huddled together, talking in low voices, constantly looking out at the sea, watching for any sea lights that might indicate danger.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the large ship did not use guiding lights, and with full power, it flew forward, breaking through the waves. The watchmen were more numerous than usual. On the bridge, the captain led a group of sailors, staying awake all night.</p>
<p>For such a long time, Jack sat in front of the radio, constantly listening until the second day at dawn, when a bit of sound came from the radio, breaking the silence. The British cruiser "Shasha" was talking to the "Suofuke," but the message was in code. Jack could only get the two ship names, but nothing else about the conversation.</p>
<p>At breakfast time, the passengers were all worried, sleepless, and haggard as they gathered in the restaurant. The captain said a few words to comfort them, but to little effect. Everyone knew that the ship was running wildly aimlessly, and the police dogs of the ocean were searching everywhere, waiting to capture this valuable prize.</p>
<p>Four icebergs</p>
<p>That night, there was a thick fog. But this could not reduce the ship's speed. Without lights, the deck and cabins were still pitch black. It was running at full speed, crashing aimlessly on the sea. The passengers felt even more uneasy. Later, they sent a representative to see the captain, requesting that the speed be reduced and that they not crash around in the darkness like this.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Championship - Zhi Xing Wins the Shen Bao Cup - Defeats Zhonghua 40 to 18 - Southwestern Team Slightly Edges Out Hua Xiong in the First Game</h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Championship took place last night at the Qingnian Hui Fitness Center. Many people attended, clearly showing the responsibility of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength. It is difficult not to be grateful.</p>
<p>In the first game, Southwestern faced Hua Xiong. Both teams had faced setbacks in the past two games, with little hope for the championship. However, due to their similar strength, the competition was fierce. Southwestern won narrowly with a score of 27 to 21.</p>
<p>The second game was an important battle to decide the championship. The audience's focus was also gathered here. However, most people did not expect that Zhonghua would collapse and be defeated by Zhi Xing.</p>
<p>The reason for Zhonghua's defeat was poor defense, especially with no one able to stop Chen Rongtang's movements. Therefore, Rongtang got the ball almost every time, dodged past opponents, and scored more than 30 points with his own strength. It was truly a surprising feat.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Zhi Xing immediately took the upper hand. Rongtang scored repeatedly, while the forwards of Zhonghua were blocked by Zhi Xing's defenders and made no progress. Later, Liu Shouguang was brought in to play, but it was of no avail. Because they had already lost too much in the first half, the morale of the team was greatly affected, and the overall situation collapsed. Even if they wanted to save it, they were powerless.</p>
<p>Zhi Xing's defense was effective, making it impossible for Zhonghua's forwards to perform under their control. Even with Shouguang's agility, they sighed that their skills were exhausted. Therefore, Zhi Xing's victory was due to their balanced offense and defense.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire game, Zhi Xing was in control. Rongtang was especially active. By the end of the first half, they had already won 25 to 5. Later, Zhonghua adjusted and had Rong Meikui defend, and the defense was slightly strengthened. Therefore, the forwards showed some improvement under fierce fighting. However, the losses in the first half were too great, and there was no way to turn the tide. In the end, they were defeated 18 to 40, and the Shen Bao Cup was won by Zhi Xing. The scores of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(Zhi Xing) Shots Free Throws Fouls Points</p>
<p>He Defang 3 0 2 6</p>
<p>Li Baozhen 2 0 0 4</p>

<h3>Chunfeng Appeals Case - The Federation Executes the Original Judgment - Also Accuses Chunfeng of Being Disloyal to the Federation - Many Players Suspended</h3>
<p>The final of this year's Group B basketball tournament was the game between Chunfeng and Peiying on the 7th of this month. At the end of the game, Chunfeng won 29 to 28. Afterwards, it was discovered that the photograph of the Chunfeng player He Dizhang did not match the person playing. After inspection by the committee members on site, it was unanimously agreed that it was not He Dizhang himself. The Federation had resolved to cancel the two points that Chunfeng had won in that game and award them to Peiying. However, Chunfeng believed that the Federation's decision was unjust and submitted a letter of appeal to the Federation Committee yesterday [the 15th], stating that [1] He Dizhang, who played that night, was indeed the original He Dizhang who was registered, (2) if a replacement player was discovered, they should have been stopped immediately and not brought up after the end of the game, (3) the Federation's cancellation of their winning score was unjust, etc. After receiving the letter, the Federation held an emergency committee meeting at the Hong Kong News Reporters Association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. After the meeting, the referees and recorders first announced what had happened that night, and then started the discussion. All the committee members expressed their opinions. After careful consideration, it was decided that the Federation had obtained sufficient evidence regarding Chunfeng's appeal case. They also obtained a handwritten statement from He Dizhang himself stating that he had not attended the Chunfeng vs. Peiying game on the 7th, showing that Chunfeng had indeed used someone else to impersonate He Dizhang to play the game. The evidence was conclusive, and it was believed that Chunfeng's actions were disloyal to the Federation. The committee members resolved to punish Chunfeng team captain Xu Zhouxing and person in charge Li Chongyi by suspending their eligibility to compete for one year from the date of the decision. Players Bi Yongzhao, Xu Dao, and Chen Shufen were suspended from competition for six months from the date of the decision. Furthermore, Chunfeng team's eligibility to compete in this year's competition was canceled, and the team's score in the Group B finals was completely canceled. In addition, the date for the awarding ceremony for the men's Group A and B and the Shen Bao Cup charity match, the date for the Guo Huo Cup, and the financial report, etc., were set for discussion at a committee meeting to be held at the Reporters Association at 7:00 PM on the [23rd] of this month.</p>

<h3>Public Baseball Game - Zhonghua Defeats Hong Kong Club Again - Two Games Held This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, in the Hong Kong Public Baseball League, the Zhonghua team defeated the Hong Kong Club again with a score of 10 to 2. The Hong Kong Club, deeply aware that the Yu Bei team, which was in high spirits for the battle against Japan tomorrow, changed its original formation in order to conserve energy. They had Smeth, who was used to playing second base, pitch, and Walker, who was good at catching, play right field. In the first two innings, Zhonghua took advantage of the opponent's weak pitcher and lax defense to easily score two points. The Hong Kong Club, unable to withstand the audience's ridicule, quickly called back Rowland to the important position of pitcher.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Club was under great threat from the Zhonghua team throughout the game, and could only defend without any counterattack. In the second inning, the two points scored by Rowland and Kelly were entirely due to Higgins' triple. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan, and no one followed up, so they only scored two points.</p>
<p>The fourth inning was a lucky inning for Zhonghua. Chen Lianliang and Hu Guodong were dismissed one after another. If the Hong Kong Club had been stricter and nailed down the third batter, they could have disintegrated Zhonghua's attack. However, Zhonghua did not lose heart due to the adverse environment. Chen Fang first got a "single," and then stole two bases in a row. Cai Bingfen took advantage of Morton's missed catch to occupy first base. Chen Fen returned to the base in the chaos and scored first. After that, Qu Bingnan and Huang Rongjun each got a "double" and scored in succession. Chen Lunying and Hu Zhengqu were sent back to home base by Zhong Cansen's "double," scoring a total of six points. The strength of their momentum can be seen from this. Finally, when Hu Guodong came on, the ball he hit was intercepted by the second baseman, ending the dream. Yesterday, "Charlie" Lin Ye of the Jin Hua team was unable to play due to illness, otherwise the performance would have been even more impressive, and the score would not have been limited to this number.</p>
<p>The fifth, sixth, and seventh innings were uneventful, with nothing to commend. Zhonghua finally won a great victory with a score of 10 to 2.</p>

<h3>Gorky's Literary Legacy</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>—— Commemorating the Third Anniversary of Gorky's Death</p>
<p>June 18, 1936. A modern-day world literary giant fell from the skies over Moscow, that being Gorky, the most outstanding and thorough champion of the people's cause. After thousands of years of tireless literary and revolutionary struggles, amidst the rising of the new society he personally participated in and promoted, he passed away, departing from the masses who had fought alongside him for decades, leaving behind the literary successors he cultivated. He returned to his final rest. Today, this great literary giant has unknowingly been gone for a full three years.</p>
<p>The loss of a most courageous and powerful warrior, a most loyal and reliable friend, is undoubtedly a great loss for all the people of the world who are engaged in fierce struggles against darkness and violence. This loss can be said to be simply irreplaceable. However, everyone who has left behind positive contributions in the battles of history will not die in vain. They leave behind in this world an immeasurable wealth of endeavors, countless precious legacies, sufficient to extend their lives into the endless historical future. Gorky is such a person—and even greater and more glorious than many others who have left behind historical achievements. He created countless new literary achievements for our world and left behind many precious literary legacies. His decades of continuous literary struggle not only led the masses during his lifetime but also illuminates humanity in darkness with the most brilliant light after his death.</p>
<p>Gorky's literary legacy is exceptionally vast. Throughout his literary creation and literary struggle, there are the most extensive and multifaceted battles. He is not only a novelist but also a political commentator, theorist, essayist, poet, journalist, and editor. He is not only a realist but also a revolutionary romantic. His writing scope is incredibly complex, and the archetypes he depicts are incredibly rich. All of these are unattainable by many writers of the past and present who are mentioned in the same breath as Gorky. The bequeathing to us of these broad and multifaceted literary legacies can undoubtedly be considered one of the greatest glories of modern humanity. What methods and attitudes should we use to extract what things from his vast literary legacy?</p>
<p>Here, we can take a look at the Soviet "Literary News" memorial words to Gorky:</p>
<p>— Gorky's literature is an inexhaustible wealth of precious creative experience that our literature must absorb. Even after hundreds of years, writers will still have to learn various things from his works. Such as the mass appeal of his art, the accuracy, clarity, and conciseness of his language, the power to evoke genuine passions in the reader's heart, the keen ability to discern the internal structure of characters... all of these are worthy of our study. In any case, Gorky is a great school. He has already cultivated many great artists during his lifetime, and thereafter, even more writers will emerge from his guidance!</p>
<p>Of course, extracting Gorky's literary legacy requires starting from various aspects such as the mass appeal of his art, language, and talent. The words of Soviet "Literary News" are not wrong in this regard. However, such a view is inevitably incomplete and superficial. It cannot grasp the most central point. We know that within Gorky's vast literary legacy, there are countless aspects and countless characteristics. Grasping and extracting each aspect and each characteristic is necessary for us, but it is not central. We must certainly learn Gorky in every branch and node, but we cannot simply be satisfied with learning the branches and nodes. We must fully accept the legacy Gorky left us from the whole, from the unity. The so-called acceptance of literary legacy is not simply a technical question, but also a question of the entire literary creation method and artistic practice. Today, we must learn from Gorky, this great literary figure, how he connected his spiritual activities with real-world practices in the circumstances of his era, and learn his experience, skills, methods, and theories from the coordination of his creative activities with historical progress, so as to accumulate our own methods of artistic understanding. Only by understanding Gorky's literary legacy in this way from the whole can we organically extract and absorb everything from him.</p>
<p>Georgy Lukács, a new Soviet theorist, had a very good opinion on extracting Gorky's literary legacy. Although he did not clearly point out the basic central point of extracting Gorky's literary legacy, it is still a relatively concrete and clear opinion. He said:</p>
<p>— Learning from Gorky is by no means an easy task. It is much easier to imitate decadent artists or symbolist poets because learning from Gorky is not simply a literary issue (note: meaning literary technique – Jie Ru), the main thing is that we must learn from Gorky his attitude towards life. What does he like? Why does he like it? What does he hate? Why does he hate it? These are things we must know. How was his worldview formed? We must know this; The close relationship between the proletarian movement and proletarian humanism and realism, this must be known; In order to obtain beneficial lessons from his literary education, we must first know his highest education in life.</p>
<p>Accepting Gorky's vast literary legacy from the whole is the central task of our commemoration of Gorky today. This task not only has outstanding significance in the Soviet Union but also has extremely great significance in other countries in the world, especially in China, which is in the midst of battle. In order to create our national revolutionary literature, in order to more forcefully use our literary combat weapons, we all need to enrich and strengthen ourselves by accepting Gorky's legacy!</p>
<h3>An Interview in a Rural Village in Macheng</h3>

<p>—— Battleground Dispatches ——</p>
<p>Once you arrive on the battlefield, nothing can be predetermined. We originally wanted to stay overnight in Songbu and then visit General Li Zongren in Huangchuan to investigate the mobilization of the masses on the Henan-Hubei border. Because the war has entered the second stage, the struggle ahead is not positional warfare but mountain warfare; that is to say, strategically, we must shift to large-scale mobile warfare to achieve lasting and good results. The border area of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces is an important base for the mobile network; the winding Dabie Mountains, starting from Pingjing Pass to the east, extend all the way into Anhui, connecting with the Wan Mountains as if holding hands, while the Dahong Mountains surrounding the west, especially the northern Hubei main battlefield. However, after Councilor Chen's car was arranged, things changed again; the reason was that Miss Wu, a member of our group, suddenly received an urgent letter from an old classmate from Peking University in Wuchang, saying that General Feng Zhian was coming to Macheng soon, and part of the troops were awaiting orders to enter western Anhui, and the political training office needed help, so she could go and meet him.</p>
<p>"Then, let's go to Macheng first, okay?" Miss Wu sought everyone's agreement.</p>
<p>After considerable deliberation, a decision was finally made, and we climbed onto the truck under the intense heat of the sun. The road surface was very narrow and very rugged, so the bumping was particularly severe, and even the heart was a little shaken despite the short journey of dozens of miles.</p>
<p>Speaking of Macheng, you can't help but remember the past: this ancient city overlooking western Anhui was the base camp for attacking the "Red Zone" in the autumn of 1931. On the high ground outside the city, there are still many bunkers left. At that time, the central point of the "Red Zone" was established in Jinjiazhai, which has now been renamed Lihuang County and has taken on the important mission of mobile warfare. A torrent of iron from the Dabie Mountains will naturally overflow and roar, exerting its power in the same way as in the "Red Zone" era, if history can serve as a precedent.</p>
<p>After an hour's effort, the headquarters was found, but unfortunately, General Feng had not yet arrived, and the political training office was not here either. Coming with excitement, we were disappointed, so we temporarily changed our plan and visited nearby villages. With the introduction of the joint defense office, we successively visited seven villages.</p>
<p>"Why are we launching a war of self-defense?"</p>
<p>"To fight for independence, to fight for freedom, to fight for survival!"</p>
<p>"If our troops withdraw from Wuhan, what will you do?"</p>
<p>"Fight a mobile war."</p>
<p>"You don't have weapons, how can you fight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, they will send them! No, even plows and rakes can be used, as long as everyone is not afraid to die!"</p>
<p>This is a test of the people's awareness of resistance against Japan and at the same time, it is a latent great power. Their correct understanding, enthusiastic emotions, and strong unity cannot but amaze people and sincerely admire them.</p>
<p>"Who says victory does not belong to us?" Miss Wu's conclusion after the interview.</p>
<h3>From Chengdu to Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>5. Ning Qiang Overnight</p>
<p>These two songs thoroughly and incisively criticize the road administration of Sichuan highways.</p>
<p>These days, technique is naturally out of the question, but they are all the heartfelt voices of the common people who have suffered from various folk hardships, accumulated over the years, condensed into strong emotions, and naturally expressed by the irrepressible release of these emotions. To us, who are also common people, they are quite interesting; even those in power should not ignore their cries. The author's intention in selecting and recording them lies here.</p>
<p>6: The Sleep of National Heroes</p>
<p>The troops heading to the front line that I saw on the way yesterday also arrived in Ning Qiang around 7 pm. They stayed in various hotels, and the Ning Kang Hotel where I stayed was also filled with people in the corridors. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Gorky's Third Death Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the world more ruthless than a clock: when you are born, when you are passionately gathering the flowers of your youthful dreams, it always swings evenly. After a person is born, it gets closer to death day by day, and when you are making dying groans, it still calmly and coldly calculates every second of your time." (The Clock - Gorky)</p>
<p>Curse this calm and cold time! It took away the great literary mentor, warrior, and soul of the oppressed, Gorky. He passed away, preventing him from seeing the battle of 500 million people, and not hearing the clanging and shattering of the chains of slavery; otherwise, he would certainly have fought solemnly and fiercely, fighting alongside us!</p>
<p>Three years! Today is June 18, 1939. Time is indeed calm and cold, however, what has passed should pass, and what is eternal will transcend time and be forever—that is, forever in Gorky's literary career, combat practice, and tireless labor. In front of these shining things, time is defeated!</p>
<p>Three years, in such a solemn era, on this day when fire and blood have reddened our motherland, we learn from the literary giant, the tireless warrior!</p>
<p>"Everyone is equally unfortunate, but the most unfortunate are those who use their misfortunes as ornaments. These people crave the attention of others more than anyone else, while at the same time, they are the least deserving of other people's attention. Struggle!! This is the purpose of life, let life have nothing but struggle—then time will be the most precious, the most beautiful." (The Clock - Gorky)</p>
<p>Misfortune. How common is that? Struggle, how beautiful is that? Those who go to the path of light, who proceed to the other shore of truth, will conquer time, conquer death! Gorky, forty years of literary life and revolutionary practice, he fought for the dawn of the people and the victory of truth. His struggle, his perseverance, is what the oppressed people, in today's battle, must learn.</p>
<p>Gorky is the singer of the common people, the call to battle. Ancient Russia was stabbed to death by his pen, the bourgeoisie trembled, and the revolutionary traitors finally poisoned him to death, but his achievement lies in learning, revolutionary practice, and being closely connected with all the oppressed people.</p>
<p>"Please read books—only knowledge has the power to save people under this dome of knowledge, only it can make us spiritually strong, loyal, and conscious people, and such people can loyally love humanity, respect his work, and wholeheartedly pay attention to the extremely beautiful results of his great work that will not cease." (How I Learned - Gorky)</p>
<p>How much does he value learning and reading good books? He has better learning in life. No wonder his knowledge is so broad, and no wonder the legacy he left behind is so rich. But we should see that his learning is for "loyally loving people" and for the "great work" of human liberation. To say it boldly, without Gorky's heroic and resolute revolutionary practice, there would be no revolutionary literature, and knowledge that is not closely linked to life is empty, and a life without struggle is dead silent. Therefore, to truly understand Gorky, we must understand his knowledge and the greatness of his literature from his struggle life and revolutionary practice. Separating Gorky's literary career from his revolutionary practice is an insult to this giant!</p>
<p>Gorky worked all his life to create the road to October, and when the revolutionary monument was already high, six-fifths of the land was still pitch black, so he continued to fight for the suffering humanity in the darkness! He was connected with all the oppressed people, and he waved the battle flag without any slackening.</p>
<p>He called out in this way at the Soviet Writers' Congress (1934), marching against fascism, in order to oppose "extracting profits, enslaving various small and weak nations, and turning them into slaves of Africa." (The same as the above quote can be found in the closing speech of the conference) — just because of his increasingly vigorous fighting as he grew older, he was poisoned to death by the disciples of the devil, and had to put down his battle flag, and this battle flag is to be supported by the writers of all oppressed nations and emerging classes! — It will not fall!</p>
<p>"Learning, revolutionary practice, and being closely connected with all the oppressed people": this is a summary of Gorky's life. However, this is summarized in this "struggle"! "Struggle—this is the purpose of life"!</p>
<p>We literary youth in battle are in battle! Holding the flag of liberation, raising the banner of anti-fascism, we should learn Gorky's struggle! Learn from life and books, participate in the practice of revolution, strive for the liberation of our own nation, and constantly strive for the liberation of all mankind! Gorky's image</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Hundreds of People in Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay in a Nighttime Brawl; Triad Members Force Schoolchildren to Pay Membership Fees; Parents Ignore, Leading to Conflict; Seven or Eight People Injured in the Fight</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent reports of illegal organizations (commonly known as triads) in Hong Kong whose members harass people, forcibly recruit members, and extort money. While legitimate businessmen are not intimidated by these illegal organizations, schoolchildren, with their simple minds, weak knowledge, and minimal resistance, are often terrified and subject to their threats. However, some are not deceived and report the situation to their parents. For example, six schoolchildren from the Special Feng School on Tung Lo Wan Road reported to the sanitation bureau that they were being threatened by coolie Dai Jiu. This case was only resolved a few days ago, and last night, the 16th, a major brawl broke out in Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay due to similar matters. One side had over a hundred people, and the other side had hundreds. The intensity of the battle and the violence of the situation were unprecedented in recent years. It is reported that a few triad members, including So-and-so, were threatening several children in the village and forcing them to join the gang, stating certain problems if they did not join, but the membership fees were too expensive and beyond their means. They informed their parents and asked for money, but their parents refused to give it to them. This matter had been brewing for many days. The triad members, having received no results for a long time, threatened the children again, saying that if they did not obey and hand over the money on time, they would resolve the matter with force. The children, being ignorant, were terrified and cried to their parents. The parents, some of whom were street vendors, some boat people, and some factory workers, were furious upon hearing the news and decided not to pay attention to them. If they really came to cause trouble, they would give them a head-on blow. Unexpectedly, the triad members, seeing that the children dared to disobey and refuse to pay, gathered about a hundred people around 10:30 pm last night, the 16th, armed with bamboo poles, knives, and iron rods, and menacingly threatened the children in Tai Hang Village. Seeing that the children's parents were intentionally obstructing their progress, they indiscriminately beat anyone they met and destroyed the market to vent their anger. Fortunately, the villagers of Tai Hang Village had received news in advance. As soon as they saw the enemy arrive, they sounded the alarm and reported to all the able-bodied men in the village. As a result, no fewer than three or four hundred people gathered in response, and a major fierce battle broke out. Swords and sticks clashed with each other, and the danger of the situation was indescribable. Those who did not have weapons engaged in hand-to-hand combat. As a result, the triad members, being outnumbered, knew they could not succeed and quickly sounded the signal to retreat. Five or six of them were injured and fled, and two villagers of Tai Hang Village were also injured and sent to the hospital for treatment afterwards. By the time the police arrived to suppress the situation, the triad members had scattered and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Six More Cases of Cholera, Totaling Ninety-Three Cases</h3>
<p>There were six more cases of cholera this Thursday. According to current statistics, the number of cases of this disease this year has reached ninety-three. Other current diseases include three cases of measles, three cases of meningitis, four cases of dysentery, and twenty-eight cases of tuberculosis.</p>
<h3>Gloria Stuart to Arrive in Hong Kong with Her Husband</h3>
<p>Famous Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, along with her husband, famous screenwriter A. Sheemen, is touring the world. They arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month and will stay for about ten days before coming to Hong Kong. They will tour Hong Kong for a week and then go to Southeast Asia before returning to the United States.</p>
<h3>Thugs Impersonate Police Detectives to Search and Rob Opium Den; Cash, Opium Pipes, and Opium Paste Stolen; Opium Den Afraid to Report the Case</h3>
<p>Police detectives, seeing that bandits are rampant, have ordered their officers in the Chinese and Western districts to strictly arrest bandits in order to maintain social order. Police detectives believe that bandits often hide in opium dens and red pill dens, so they requested instructions from the police detective authorities this week, issued search warrant orders, and sent large teams of detectives to search in Sham Shui Po, Ki Lung Street, Tai Nan Street, and the Sheung Wan area of Hong Kong. As a result, more than thirty opium dens were busted, and fifty or sixty suspects were arrested. After this news was released, a gang of hoodlums thought that opium dens and red pill dens were all established in violation of Hong Kong laws, so they gathered accomplices, thinking they had a chance to act. It is reported that in an opium den on the second floor of a building on a newly reclaimed land street in Mong Kok, around 4:00 pm on the 16th, four people suddenly went upstairs and knocked on the door, claiming to be police detectives ordered to search. The owner of the opium den thought they were real police detectives, so he opened the door to let them in. The thugs, seeing that their plan had succeeded, swarmed in, using the excuse of searching for firearms. They overturned boxes and chests and ordered everyone in the opium den to stand up for inspection. They stayed for about fifteen minutes, and as a result, they searched for and stole more than twenty yuan in cash, five opium pipes, and four taels of opium paste. After succeeding, they left. The opium den realized that they were only searching and not arresting people, which was not the action of police detectives, and began to suspect something was wrong. Because their own business was illegal and violated Hong Kong law, they were afraid to report the case, fearing punishment from the police detective authorities. Afraid to antagonize those who might harm them, they dared not report the case and could only endure it. However, police detectives, when searching a building, must have a Western detective in the same post, and hold an order from the police department (the so-called flower warrant paper), before they can carry out a search. In the future, if residents encounter this situation, they must first observe whether there is a Western detective accompanying them and whether they have an order from the police detective authorities before opening the door to let them in, otherwise the danger is great. If it is an illegitimate place of business, such as an opium den or a red pill den, if such a situation occurs, they must also report it to the police station, otherwise they will be suspected of condoning bandits. When both crimes are revealed, it is very bad.</p>
<h3>Middle-Aged Female Corpse Found in a Ditch on Chatham Road, Hung Hom; Suspected of Falling into the Ditch and Dying</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 pm, a police officer on duty passed by about fifty feet above Chatham Road, Hung Hom, and caught sight of a female corpse, about thirty years old, wearing black cloth pants and a blue wicker shirt, in a ditch nearby. He immediately telegraphed back to the police station to report it, and the station sent detectives to investigate and dispatched a hearse to take the corpse to the morgue for examination. It was found that the deceased died from head injuries, and there was still five dollars in cash in her pocket, suggesting it was neither suicide nor murder. The police detective authorities suspect that the deceased fell into the ditch and died from injuries. They have taken a photo of the deceased and summoned her relatives to come and identify the body.</p>
<h3>Academic Relief Society Women's Study Group Announcement - A Letter to All Female Students in Hong Kong - Abandon Extravagant Habits and Earnestly Take Responsibility ×××××××××</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Student Relief Society has organized a Women's Study Group, and a formal establishment ceremony will be held today at 11:00 AM at the YMCA. Ms. Wang Xiaoying, a prominent figure in women's circles, has been invited to give a speech, and there will be various singing and drama performances to add to the festivities. The Society yesterday issued a letter to all female students in Hong Kong, and the original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Dear Female Students of Hong Kong:</p>
<p>The Chinese women's movement once flourished during the great era of the "May Fourth" Movement. At that time, women from all walks of life—especially female students with knowledge—voluntarily rose up to participate in all struggles, and passionately demanded and fought for freedom and equality for women in politics, economics, and education. In this struggle, they demonstrated unprecedented courage and determination. This shows that women had become a strong iron force in the "May Fourth" Movement. Therefore, in the great tide of the "May Fourth" Movement, thanks to the efforts of this group of advanced women, the initial foundation of the Chinese women's movement was started and laid. However, because their strength was weak and they did not persist in the struggle of the women's movement, the vigorous development of the Chinese women's movement gradually declined with the failure of the "May Fourth" Movement.</p>
<p>Chinese women have always been oppressed by the feudal system and bound by patriarchal society that have been left over for thousands of years. Therefore, the demand for their own liberation is more urgent for Chinese women than in any other country. This oppression directly affected and hindered the future of the Chinese women's liberation movement. Moreover, this oppression is national in nature and is suffered equally by both men and women. Therefore, women, who account for half of the country's population, must stand up and participate in the national liberation struggle as bravely and resolutely as men in order to strive for the thorough liberation of Chinese women.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese women's movement has made unprecedented progress. For example, the convening of the Lushan Women's Talks determined that the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement General Association would be the national general organization. Women leaders from all over the country, such as Soong Ching-ling, Soong Mei-ling, He Xiangning, and Shi Liang, etc., greatly led the women's movement. The heroic deeds of Zhao Laotai in Northeast China, the battlefield service groups of female students from all over the country, and the female student army in Guangxi, etc., all fully demonstrated the heroic posture of women in the War of Resistance. However, this kind of progress is still far from enough and the strength is still very weak. If we want to implement this general policy, we must unite more knowledgeable women, especially female students, to participate in the women's movement, play a model role in the women's movement, become the backbone of women, and become the vanguard of organizing and educating the vast masses of women. This is because students are the most outstanding and powerful group in the nation, and the student movement and the women's movement are equally important parts of the national liberation movement. Female students, who account for half of the students, have an inseparable and close relationship with both the women's movement and the student movement. Moreover, whether their organization and strength are sound or not directly affects the development prospects of the women's movement and the student movement. Precisely because of this, in order to develop the women's movement and support the women's movement, it is necessary to unite and organize the vast number of female students.</p>
<p>Students, in the past, female students in Hong Kong have always been scattered and disorganized. They are regarded as "Hong Kong Misses," who either live a romantic and extravagant life of pleasure all day long, or are trapped in feudal families. There is no talk of national liberation or women's liberation at all. Since the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan began, a part of the students in Hong Kong have been awakened by the sacred sound of the cannons of the War of Resistance. The Hong Kong Student Relief Society was also established under the needs of the War of Resistance. As a result, a small number of female students also participated in student work under the leadership of teachers. However, because the Hong Kong student movement has no foundation, so far, the number of female students united under this Hong Kong student fortress is still very small, and the performance of their work is still far from the needs of ××. However, our female students occupy a very important position in the women's movement and the student movement. In the development process of the women's movement and the student movement, the lack of this group of female students with great strength is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is no longer permissible for us to continue delaying the broader task of uniting and organizing all female students in Hong Kong to support the student movement and develop the women's movement.</p>
<p>Students, the Women's Study Group of the Relief Society was established based on this need. So, what exactly is the Women's Study Group? We can simply explain it: (1) The basic task of the Women's Study Group is to unite all female students in Hong Kong, participate in collective life, increase anti-Japanese awareness, and at the same time, under our mutual encouragement and mutual research, give full play to our strength and serve the country and the nation. (2) The working method of the Women's Study Group is to adapt to Hong Kong's circumstances and use working methods that cater to the lives of female students and meet their demands to unite them. For example, on the one hand, we can often lead a collective life, and carry out interesting activities such as outings, sports, singing, and group games. On the other hand, we can carry out meaningful work such as reading, research, social services, and popular education. Furthermore, under the guidance of consultants and teachers, and with our mutual encouragement, we can complete our task of developing the women's movement and supporting the student movement.</p>
<p>Dear female students, today we must more clearly understand our position and strength in the entire nation, firmly grasp our tasks, and not underestimate ourselves in the slightest. We also hope that the Women's Study Group can continuously improve the past bad lives of female students under the support and supervision of the students, gradually consolidate itself, grow stronger, and truly take on the great task of ×××× and liberating women. Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation! Long live the liberation of Chinese women! Hong Kong Student Relief Society</p>
<h3>Detained in Guangzhou for Ten Days - The Foshan Steamer Released and Returned to Hong Kong - Yesterday's Temporary Sailing Carried Only Over Three Hundred Passengers - Guangzhou is Full of Bandits and Our Air Force Comes to Reconnoiter From Time to Time</h3>
<p>The Foshan steamer sailed to Guangzhou on the sixth of this month. It was originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the eighth. It was unreasonably detained by the × party. After negotiations by the British Consulate, it was finally released, but it had been detained for more than ten days. The steamer moved to return to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM yesterday and arrived at 4:05 PM. There were only three hundred passengers. According to people on the steamer, the reason for this sudden and unreasonable detention is unknown. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Police Detectives Arrive to Maintain Order</p>
<p>After the Foshan steamer was detained by ×, people in Hong Kong were concerned. After receiving the news that the steamer had been released and returned to Hong Kong, many went to the pier to inquire. Therefore, around 3:00 PM yesterday, the area near the pier of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Macao Steamboat Company was extremely crowded with people waiting for the steamer. It is estimated that they were lined up from Sincere Company to the front of the New China Hotel, standing almost full, like a long snake, blocking traffic. The police station, fearing petty theft, sent a large team of Chinese and Western police detectives in patrol cars to maintain traffic order. At the same time, dozens of police officers checked the 20-yuan landing guarantee deposit for each person at the pier. They did not withdraw the team until the passengers boarded the ship. More than a dozen passengers were taken away to the prison camp because they did not have cash guarantees.</p>
<p>Unreasonably Detained, the Reason is Unknown</p>
<p>Yesterday, only 329 passengers came to Hong Kong on the steamer, including seven Westerners, which was a great reduction compared to the more than 1,000 passengers who returned to Hong Kong in the past. According to a senior staff member on the steamer, the steamer arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the sixth and was scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the eighth. However, the next (seventh) day, it received a notice from the × party that the steamer was not allowed to sail. Under the power of ×, it had no choice but to obey the order to stop sailing. At the same time, passenger tickets that had already been booked were returned, totaling more than a thousand people. It was not until a few days ago that news of the release and departure was received, so a telegram was sent back to Hong Kong to report the whereabouts. So far, the reason for the detention is completely unknown. It is only known that it was released after the British Consulate lodged a protest. The return to Hong Kong today was a temporary movement, and no notice was issued in advance. Therefore, many of those who had booked tickets did not have time to attach them. The sudden reduction in passengers was really due to this reason.</p>
<p>Our Divine Eagle Team Flies to Guangzhou from Time to Time</p>
<p>Talking about the recent situation in Guangzhou, the crew member said that although Guangzhou is surrounded by a dark atmosphere and has not seen the light, gambling, drugs, and bandits are like ghost markets. The steamer stayed in Guangzhou for many days. The crew members, considering the rampant thieves, warned each other not to enter the city. They only hid on the ship, waiting for news of their return to Hong Kong. However, gunshots could be heard intermittently at night, and the situation was extremely terrifying. According to foreigners living on Shamian Island, our Divine Eagle team sometimes reconnoitered over Guangzhou, occasionally dropping bombs in the suburbs. The × people could not sleep or eat in peace. On the eighth of this month, twenty-two of our aircraft were discovered flying over the Guangzhou sky, high in the clouds, and the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth could be seen vaguely. This time, no bombs were dropped, but the × in Guangzhou were disturbed. On the way back to Hong Kong, no trace of × warships was found. Only when sailing to Humen (the Bogue) were several × cargo ships found loading and unloading goods there.</p>
<h3>Next Year's King of England's Birthday to be Celebrated on June 13th</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong Government Gazette announced that the birthday of the King of England next year will be celebrated on June 13th (a Thursday), and a military parade will be held. Last year's celebration was on September 9th, and this year it was on June 8th.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Carrier HMS Eagle Replaces Captain - Mr. Blagey Succeeds</h3>
<p>Captain Inedy of the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle of the British China Fleet has served for two and a half years and has recently been transferred to another position. The vacancy has been filled by Mr. Blagey, appointed by the British Admiralty. Mr. Blagey is currently the principal of the Dartmouth Naval School. After being appointed, he set out for China last week to take office.</p>
<h3>Zhiyong Middle School Celebrates Graduating Students</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong campus of Zhiyong Middle School has more than 170 graduates from the senior and junior high schools this year. The joint association of the first and second grades of the senior and junior high schools of the school, considering that the graduation of the students of each department is near, specially held a celebration meeting at the North River Theatre at 8:00 AM yesterday. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, which was presided over by Mr. Yongji. After performing the etiquette as usual, Principal Su Tairui and all the teachers of the school gave passionate speeches. Then, Mr. Dai Yue, the representative of the graduating students, gave a reply. Immediately afterwards, art performances were performed. After the meeting, all the staff and students of the school took a photo to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Swearing-in Ceremony at Pei Ying Branch School</h3>
<p>The First Brigade of Boy Scouts at Pei Ying Branch School has spared no effort in training since its establishment last month, and its progress has been remarkable. There are quite a few who have joined later. After passing the examination by the Hong Kong Boy Scouts Association, a ceremony of completion of the intermediate level and enlistment of the primary level was held at the school's exchange field on Bonham Road yesterday (17th). Mr. Hou Li Hua, the Hong Kong Italian Army Chief Inspector, attended the swearing-in ceremony. The order was rich, especially the construction of the bridge by the Eleventh Brigade of Pei Ying, which was very agile. The performance of the savage bonfire party by the Fifteenth Brigade of Kowloon was lifelike, both solemn and humorous. Other musical performances and songs were also quite moving. During this period of the War of Resistance, it is a sign of hope for victory that the children in the rear can promote our martial spirit.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Revises Dangerous Goods Ordinance</h3>
<p>For the sake of safeguarding public safety, the Hong Kong authorities have prepared a draft amendment to the Dangerous Goods Ordinance of 1875, which stipulates strict management methods for the storage of petroleum. According to the draft amendment, if all or part of the goods carried by any vessel are petroleum, the owner or captain of the vessel must submit a written report to the Director of Marine, stating (A) the quantity of petroleum carried on the ship, (B) the number of oil tanks, oil drums, barrels, and other equipment, (C) the nature of the petroleum carried, and (D) a certificate indicating the flash point of the petroleum carried. Anyone who violates the regulations, the dangerous goods and their loading equipment will be confiscated. The defendant may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not more than 250 yuan. The judge may also order the cancellation of the license held by the plaintiff.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Relief Committee Sponsors - China Charity School Opens Today - Unsuccessful Teachers May Be Assigned to Serve in Refugee Camps</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to out-of-school refugees, has established China Charity Schools in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, and organized a Committee for the Relief of Out-of-School Refugee Children to be responsible for the management. Preparations have been completed to date, and the registration, classification, testing of out-of-school refugee children, and the recruitment of unemployed teachers have all been completed. There are more than 6,000 registered students in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, who are accommodated in various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is now scheduled to open classes at 1:00 PM today, and opening ceremonies will be held separately in each school to distribute books and allocate student seats. Classes will begin on Monday evening. The teaching hours for each charity school have also been scheduled, from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM from Monday to Friday, from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM on Saturday, and classes will be held in the morning and rest in the afternoon on Sunday. Regarding the school buildings, 110 rooms have been borrowed from Ying Shi and Jiu Liang, and 70 to 80 more rooms are needed to accommodate all the out-of-school refugee children. The association is still continuing to negotiate with various schools in Hong Kong and China to borrow rooms. Furthermore, regarding the more than 1,000 unemployed teachers, only over 100 have been selected by drawing lots. How to arrange for the others is still a problem. The Relief Committee raised the issue for discussion at a meeting held a few days ago. After discussion, it was decided to telegraph Chairman Li of the Provincial Relief Committee for instructions, but there has been no reply so far. Some committee members now have the opinion that many out-of-school refugee children live in various refugee camps in Hong Kong and China, and this opportunity can be used to seek the consent of unemployed teachers to be sent to serve in various refugee camps, to educate refugees in the camps. The living expenses will still be paid by the Education Committee in the same way as employed teachers. In this way, the unsuccessful teachers will be resettled, and the refugees can receive education during the difficult period. The association is currently considering this matter.</p>

<h3>Memories of "City of Five Rams"</h3>
<p>— Xia Yan</p>
<p>The performance of "City of Five Rams" brought me into a world of memories, first, the distant thoughts of the friends who created this script, and second, the feelings of longing for Guangzhou under the fierce bombing of Japanese planes at this time last year.</p>
<p>Shanghai four years ago was a place worth remembering for the spoken drama movement. At that time, we had a small magazine that we could edit based on our own plans, and we consciously published a series of rough and immature scripts in this magazine, but more or less contributed some help to the national salvation movement at that time. At that time, the people who always gathered together to chat were Hong Shen, Zhang Geng, You Jing, Ling He, Zhang Min, and me. We always ate at the Oriental Hotel, where Mr. Hong Shen often lived, every ten days or half a month, talking freely, and the result was that scripts like "Descendants of Traitors," "Foreign White Sugar," and "Our Hometown," which has now been adapted into "City of Five Rams," were produced from this kind of chat.</p>
<p>The environment at the time was quite delicate, but these short plays were just adapted to the wildfire-like needs of drama troupes across the country. Before the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Descendants of Traitors" was the most performed script, but precisely because of this, we were attacked by people who "loved Bi Shu" more than they loved the country. The four words "collective creation" became our crime, and the condemnation has continued to this day - although we do not take this kind of condemnation seriously.</p>
<p>In this kind of chat gathering, Hong Shen always spoke the most and Zhang Min spoke the least. Once I became interested in the personality of an old man who was just alert to the old but had a strong sense of justice. Starting from this personality, we chatted out another script. Because the location in the play was in Beiping, and Zhang Min had lived in Beiping the longest, the responsibility of writing was pushed on him. Among the many scripts created at that time, I preferred this one, because no matter what, it was a more structurally complete attempt to characterize several characters in the play.</p>
<p>As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the friends who chatted together at that time scattered, but it can be answered with pride to those who condemned us at that time, that this group of people are still standing on the front lines of drama in an unyielding battle. Hong Shen and Ling He have met in Hankou, Changsha, and Guilin. When I arrived in Shanghai this time, You Jing still said nostalgically, "Now there is no such gathering where we can talk about everything from ancient to modern times." He misses Min as much as I do. The silent and tenacious man has written many excellent scripts in the past year and a half. I am sure that the constant bombing of Chongqing will provide him with many touching and heroic materials.</p>
<p>Now "Our Hometown" has been adapted into "City of Five Rams."</p>
<p>At this time last year, we were in Guangzhou under a month-long bombing. From May 27th to June 30th, the bombing did not stop for a single day, but June in Guangzhou was so lovely! At that time, it was the season for ginger flowers and lychees! Although I was threatened by blood and smoke, and the threat of death, I couldn't raise the thought of leaving Guangzhou. This love for Guangzhou is no different for me than for Wang Zuzhang in the play, although this charming city is not my "hometown." I can frankly confess that I love Guangzhou more than the West Lake in my "hometown," but after leaving her in the early morning of October 21st, which I will never forget, I can only be tormented by homesickness as deeply as that group of people in the play. The shadow tree flowers have withered, and now it is the time for guavas, right?</p>
<p>I believe that Guangzhou, which can be so dearly loved by me, a foreigner, must be loved and hated by the Cantonese people a hundred times more than us. The Cantonese compatriots, who are known for their bravery and love of their homeland, will not allow the shame of staining Guangzhou to congeal in their hearts.</p>
<p>Go and see "City of Five Rams." Don't forget "Our Hometown."</p>
<p>The day "Before Dawn" is performed.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Grand Reunion of Hong Kong-Based Drama Actors: A Joint Charity Performance of "Before Dawn"</h3>
<p>— Shi Liang</p>
<p>In order to promote unity and cooperation within the drama community, to contribute high-quality theatrical art in its current stage, and to raise funds for charitable causes supporting the cultural endeavors of our homeland, domestic drama practitioners based in Hong Kong have, in a short period of time, swiftly combined their individual strengths and gathered into a powerful torrent. On the nights of the 16th and 17th, an unprecedented "Joint Charity Performance by Hong Kong-Based Drama Actors" was held at the Lee Theatre. The playbill, "Before Dawn," comprised four of the most exquisite and outstanding representative dramatic works, all depicting the poignant and inspiring stories of struggle leading up to the imminent arrival of dawn. Now, relying on my observations, I briefly write down a few points, considering them as my personal reflections after the performance!</p>
<p>The groups participating in this joint charity performance were the three most renowned domestic theater troupes based in Hong Kong: the China Art Theater, the China Traveling Theater, and the China Salvation Theater. The directors were Ouyang Yuqian and Jin Shan. The cast members (listed in order of the number of strokes in their surnames) were: Wang Ying, Li Jingbo, Li Danlu, Jin Li, Jin Shan, Jiang Ming, Ke Gang, Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, Fan Zheng, Sun Zhaoxin, Qin Xiaozhu, Zhang Li , Huang He, Tong Yi, Yang Wei, Deng Zhujun, Ge Xin, Ya Mei, Zi Ying, Su Hui, etc. All are outstanding drama actors with profound accomplishments and a long history of dedicated involvement in the dramatic arts. Unfortunately, in the past, due to their respective working environments, their efforts in the salvation drama movement have been separate endeavors. This collaboration—such close cooperation—is truly a "groundbreaking first"!</p>
<p>Considering its role in strengthening the unity movement within the drama community—both in Hong Kong and nationally—this joint charity performance should have its historical value. This performance fully demonstrated the power of collective effort. Through this strength, all obstacles were overcome. Everyone worked diligently, sweating and struggling to keep their sleepless eyes open, and ultimately, because it was a collective effort and a scientific division of labor, it achieved such a multiplier effect.</p>
<p>And among the members encompassed in this collective, there were the "China Salvation" troupe, about to go abroad for promotion, and the "China Traveling Theater," which had split up into separate divisions working independently after a division. Under the call to raise funds for domestic cultural undertakings and strengthen the unity movement within the drama community, the members of the "China Traveling," "China Art," and "China Salvation" troupes closely joined hands. This point alone is of great significance to these three troupes themselves!</p>
<p>The overall title of the plays performed was "Before Dawn," comprising four one-act plays. These plays are among the best existing one-act plays in China. Apart from "Dawn," most of them have been performed many times. Two of the four plays, "The Thief" and "The Street Performer," had previously been presented to Hong Kong audiences under the banner of "Protecting the Motherland." However, the previous public performance by "China Salvation" was packed every night. Who doesn't still regret those who were turned away due to sold-out tickets and returned home complaining? This regret now has a chance to be compensated. "The Street Performer," also known as "Fleeing to Hong Kong," and "Put Down Your Whip," holds the record for the most performances both before and after the War of Resistance. Perhaps most Hong Kong audiences have seen this play, but Jin Shan and Wang Ying's performances in it are "nationally renowned." In the war zones, hearing the "Shanghai Salvation Drama Second Troupe" perform "Put Down Your Whip, the frontline brothers would be ecstatic." In "The Street Performer," Jin Shan plays a decrepit old man and Wang Ying plays a delicate young woman, both with uncanny likeness and touching depth. Additionally, Hua Zheng, a thirteen-year-old child with remarkable achievements in children's work, delivers the opening passage of the story in the play with perfect timing. No wonder the entire drama community in China recognizes their acting skills as standardized!</p>
<p>"Dawn" is the recent work of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, leader of the "China Art" troupe. Mr. Ouyang, who has been consistently dedicated to the drama movement for thirty years, wrote and directed the play himself. Combined with the acting skills of Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, Li Danxia, Yang Wei, Sun Zhaoxin, Zhang Lifang, Tong Yi, Lin Yamei, and Ge Xin, although it is a one-act play, it left a profound impression on my mind. Li Jingbo, in this performance, played a chauffeur who wants to contribute to the country and serve his homeland, while Jiang Ming played a stingy wealthy man who becomes upset and angry upon hearing about fundraising, but does not hesitate to spend thousands of dollars on personal extravagance. Both actors portrayed their characters with remarkable skill, eliciting both laughter and disdain from the audience. Additionally, there was Li Danxia's wife, Yang Wei's second wife, and Sun Zhaoxin's daughter, each excelling in their respective roles. This is a new work by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a moving scene.</p>
<p>The director of "Redemption" is Mr. Jin Yan, who also served as the stage manager for the previous performances. Mr. Jin Shan directed the play—in fact, Mr. Jin Shan directed three of these four plays, and "Redemption" is the most recent one he completed.</p>
<p>Most remarkably, the "Tang Trio" appeared together on stage in a one-act play, something rarely seen in recent years. The script invested considerable effort in psychological portrayal, and the actors also achieved excellent results in this aspect. The entire play was lighthearted and lively, leaving you without a trace of fatigue.</p>
<p>"The Thief" is an adaptation by "China Salvation." Jin Shan, who played the old man in "The Street Performer," and Wang Ying, who played the village girl, completely "transformed" in this play. One became a fashionable young gentleman, and the other played a sophisticated lady. Watching these two plays, one could be dazzled, unable to imagine that a person's appearance, age, and personality could change so quickly. However, the cast list clearly states the facts, leaving you with no choice but to believe. The script is lighthearted, humorous, and inspiring, combining both. Their performance truly brought out the full potential of scathing satire!</p>
<p>The contents of this performance all depicted the poignant and inspiring stories of struggle before the arrival of dawn. Contemporary themes, actors with great reputations in the country...these factors made this performance, even if it cannot be said to be a presentation of the highest standards of Chinese drama, a rare achievement in drama.</p>
<p>And the greatest success was bringing the Hong Kong-based drama actors together on stage, allowing them to showcase their individual talents and skills, while also closely uniting them to strive for drama!</p>
<h3>Prelude to the "Five Rams City" Charity Performance by the China Traveling Theater: An Introduction to Several Important Cantonese-Speaking Actors</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhi</p>
<p>It is truly gratifying that in Hong Kong, where the drama movement is actively expanding, so many "charity performances" are being held one after another. The most recent and prominent ones include the joint charity performance "Huanghuagang" by the entire Hong Kong drama community, the "Phoenix City" charity performance by the "China Traveling Theater," the charity performance by "China Salvation" before going abroad, and the joint charity performance by Hong Kong-based drama actors "Before Dawn" held the day before yesterday... Many performances held by schools and organizations have achieved excellent donation results and powerful publicity effects. This phenomenon not only demonstrates the fervent patriotism of many drama groups but also shows that "spoken drama" has gradually attracted the attention of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and is about to reach a stage where it is universally accepted by the public. Isn't this an extremely gratifying state of affairs!</p>
<p>Since its reconstruction, the China Traveling Theater has strived to do everything possible and appropriate for the times. Therefore, its first demonstration of work was a purely voluntary performance of "Phoenix City" at the Queen's Theatre, meeting with people from all walks of life and receiving encouragement and support from audiences and friends in the cultural and artistic circles. However, that was only a demonstration of a portion of the "China Traveling Theater's" strength, because "China Traveling Theater" now has two equally capable teams. In order to adapt to the dialects of the audience in South China, the Cantonese team was organized from the day of "reconstruction." Now, they have been burying their heads in preparation for half a year, honing their skills and waiting for action.</p>
<p>Now, the Cantonese team of the China Traveling Theater will also dedicate its first performance to the country. Zhang Xuefeng, the director of "Phoenix City," the previous Mandarin performance, needs no further introduction.</p>
<p>What must be especially mentioned here is Miss Deng Zhujun, who plays Li Baozhen in the play. She is the most important female actor in the Cantonese team. Due to her skillful acting and sincere work attitude, many plays are starred by her. She is from Sanshui, Guangdong, and is twenty-two years old, healthy, lively, and bright, truly like the warmth of "spring" and the meteor of "water." She began her dramatic activities at the age of seventeen, guest-starring in many plays in various schools in Guangzhou, and co-founded the "Feng Society" with Zhang Xuefeng, publicly performing many national defense plays. Later, she worked in Macau and launched many school drama movements. She is familiar with "Our Hometown." When it was publicly performed in Guangzhou, Mr. Hong Shen appraised it, believing that her expressions and movements were skilled and had a special magic that attracted the audience. Now her acting skills are even more refined, and her rehearsals are more serious. It should be possible to achieve even further progress!</p>
<p>Zhang Ying's portrayal of Wang Zhongwen is very appropriate. And what is most commendable is Li Heng's portrayal of Wang Jinwen. He truly grasps the character's personality and emotions to the fullest extent, dissolving them into his skillful acting. His profound and natural performance fully demonstrates that he is a drama actor with great promise.</p>
<p>Xu Man's female servant has few scenes but excellent gags. Zhang Lun's coarse performance is strong enough. Liang Shan also works hard to play Liu Xiansheng. Others such as Liao Zhaoxing and Zhang Yufeng also have appropriate performances.</p>
<p>There are also two very noteworthy Mandarin actors who take on two very important roles, because they are all Cantonese, so they can competently fulfill them!! One is Liao Fan, who plays Wang Zuzhang, depicting this unyielding old man sternly, surpassing all the plays he has played before, with insightful understanding and performance. The other is Huang He, who plays Yin Jiaming, acting as a villain with understanding and causing hatred among comrades during rehearsals.</p>
<p>In addition, Tang Huaiqiu from the Mandarin team plays a clerk in the play, and Zhao Shuo and others also go on stage to play minor roles, partly to express the spirit of cooperation of the "China Traveling Theater" and partly to increase the audience's interest.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the "roundness" and "fineness" of the "Five Rams City" performance should surpass "Phoenix City." Wish them to work harder!</p>
<p>When the Student Self-Government Association of Lingnan University decided to hold a charity performance to raise funds for wounded soldiers and refugees and invited the "China Traveling Theater" to perform, the China Traveling Theater immediately agreed to repay the society with a Cantonese performance of "Five Rams City." It has now been decided that it will be held at the Queen's Theatre at 9 p.m. on the 22nd of this month. The nature and methods are roughly the same as the previous charity performance of "Phoenix City."</p>
<p>"Five Rams City" is a play that the "China Traveling Theater" has been preparing for several months. The script is adapted from "Our Hometown." Under the meticulous direction of Zhang Xuefeng, the entire play has developed extremely smoothly and vividly. It can be said to be delicate and vivid. Now I will specifically introduce my observations of their rehearsals and the most important actors in it, which may also be something that comrades who love drama are happy to know.</p>
<p>First of all, it is necessary to mention Zhang Xuefeng, who bears the responsibility of directing, stage design, and stage equipment, and also plays an old servant in the play. His abilities are multifaceted, and he is able to do everything himself. In addition to being responsible for the Cantonese team, he is in charge of all the stage decorations for the entire team. He participates in the rehearsal work of many school groups, meticulous and considerate, hardworking and dedicated.</p>

<h3>We Need Dawn</h3>
<p>— Huang Hua</p>
<p>As long as we "realize that what is right now is right and what was wrong yesterday was wrong" and act accordingly, no matter how darkness and hardship fill the period before dawn, no matter how much suffering and cruelty there is, the dawn will eventually arrive.</p>
<p>The joint grand performance of "Before Dawn" by Hong Kong-based drama actors in the past two days is a sharp and essential satire of reality, exposing the present state of affairs before dawn and at the moment of the impending dawn. It portrays the contradictory phenomena in society before the light and inspires a unified resonance among compatriots from all walks of life. Whether they are thieves, corrupt officials, charming young men, wanderers, children, or old men... when they awaken, they all shout loudly! "We need dawn!"</p>
<p>Dawn—is a symbol of joy, liveliness, freedom, equality, and liberation. Dawn will illuminate our common goal of "Resisting the war will surely win, and nation-building will surely succeed." It is the torch of the greatest and brightest truth, the gospel of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>This performance truly grasped and touched the hearts of countless audiences, tightly gripping the hearts of every patriotic Chinese son and daughter with its tragic, painful, and passionate actions, bringing the old and new sorrows of the country and family together before their eyes. Just the scene of "The Street Performer" alone made people unable to hold back tears of sympathy, followed by excited shouts. If we were to describe this performance in two sentences, we could really say that "the tragedy is tragic to the extreme, and the excitement is also excited to the extreme," especially for those of us who have fled to Hong Kong and have "the same feelings." We feel even more that the responsibilities we have fulfilled in the past are not enough and that we need "redemption."</p>
<p>The actors' earnest dedication and rigorous attitude are truly awe-inspiring. This point alone is already very difficult and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>This joint performance undoubtedly strengthened the united front of the local drama movement in Hong Kong and has shown unprecedented progress and unprecedented unity. We further hope to maintain and continuously strengthen this power.</p>
<p>We need the dawn of resisting war and building the nation, and we also need to reach the dawn of the united front of the drama community in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Comrades, put your strength out, the dawn is in front of us!</p>
<h3>Theoretical Research on the Historical Drama "Liang Hongyu"</h3>
<p>— Liu Danqing</p>
<p>The collective creation of "The Battle of Taierzhuang" by the China Salvation Drama Troupe was performed in Hong Kong, causing a sensation and unprecedentedly expanding the sensory effect and scope of drama. The script has been published by Life Bookstore as the first type of the troupe's books. The previous issue of this magazine already introduced it. Now, the second type of the troupe's series, the four-act historical drama "Liang Hongyu" (also known as "Huang Tiandang"), written by Liu Danqing of the troupe, will be published soon. This article is the theoretical basis of the play by Liu Jun, which is published here first. - Editor</p>
<p>The preparatory work for the China Salvation Drama Troupe's overseas publicity is multifaceted, and the preparation of the script is one of them. In addition to the already performed "The Battle of Taierzhuang" and other existing scripts, Mr. Hong Shen and Mr. Xia Yan have both promised to provide us with the latest works, but in order to adapt to the special circumstances and special requirements of certain places overseas, we plan to prepare some historical dramas for indirect publicity.</p>
<p>Among many historical stories of national heroes, we selected Yue Fei and Liang Hongyu. However, some gentlemen provided the opinion that tragedies are inevitable, and Yue Fei's tragic ending is inevitable, which is not in line with the current anti-war situation. We accepted this opinion, so we focused our attention on the issue of Liang Hongyu.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's opera "Liang Hongyu" is a good script in terms of both form and content. However, there are two preconditions for us to rewrite the historical drama "Liang Hongyu" in the form of spoken drama: First, we do not have many skills that can be used in Chinese opera, and we must use other things to make up for this shortcoming; Second, we do not want to use history as an old bottle to fill with new wine, calling it the Song Dynasty, to say modern things, because historical development has its own laws, and there are also different environments and styles to match, but they can explain each other. So, what is our basis? It is realism, historical realism, a historical, realistic character, tools, life, habits and style.</p>
<p>Reading the History of the Song Dynasty and studying the history of the Song-Jin War inevitably raises two questions: Why did the Jin win and why did the Song lose? Did the Song have enough strength to repel the enemy?</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, from the current point of view, it is a bit strange. In terms of soldiers, weapons, financial resources, and land, the Jin was not in an advantageous position, and the Song was not a weak country in a disadvantageous position, but the Song eventually took a backseat and suffered defeats. This is the fallacy of weapon theory. From another point of view, Jin was a backward small country, but it was able to grow stronger in the war. Although the Song was an advanced big country, it was weakened in concession. This proves that the national strength of the warring parties can be strengthened. The key to the change lies in the overall strategy and tactics. In the Song Dynasty court, loyalty and treachery were unclear, rewards and punishments were uncertain, and war and peace were undecided. The court lost the people's hearts and failed to rally the troops. The command of the pro-war factions was inconsistent, and the pro-peace factions were willing to compromise. The court did not reward the military and civilians who bravely killed the enemy, and did not investigate the traitors who surrendered to the enemy. It is no wonder that they were completely defeated.</p>
<p>The second question, did the Song have enough strength to repel the enemies? It can be said with certainty that it did. Before the Song moved its capital to the south, it never had a major decisive battle with the enemy. The four directions still had the troops of the various princes, and the southeast had ample wealth. In terms of generals, there were Li Gang, Zong Ze, Zhao Shidao, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong. In terms of morale, there were Chen Dong, Xu Kui, and Ouyang Che. In terms of popular support, although the two rivers were lost, what the Jin guarded were only a few cities. The rest were mostly in the hands of the military and civilians who supported the Song Dynasty, thinking about the court sending troops to recover the lost land. Unfortunately, Emperors Huizong, Qinzong, and Gaozong and the likes of Li Bangyan, Huang Qianshan, Wang Boyan, and Qin Hui consistently suffered from fear of Jin and did not trust the strength of the country's military and civilians, and could not be at peace in their secure positions.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, raising a tiger leaves trouble. Jin, this evil tiger, was raised by the Song. Jin was originally a backward small country, but because it was able to concentrate power and make better use of human and financial resources, it gained ground and annexed the two rivers and two capitals, invaded the two lakes and two huai, seized the two emperors, and pursued Gaozong in Dinghai. From this, it can be seen that strong neighbors will never be satisfied. The atrocities of the Jin soldiers were even more difficult to describe. In the Pingjiang area alone, the Jin soldiers burned and looted, killing 500,000 people.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there were traitors who colluded with the enemy, and on the other hand, there were loyal and brave generals. Yue Fei fought in Guangde, winning all six battles, and fought in Changzhou, winning all four battles. Han Shizhong used 8,000 people to resist Wuzhu's 100,000 troops in the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang for forty-eight days.</p>
<p>In fact, the Jin soldiers were not terrible. When Wuzhu captured Lin'an and pursued Gaozong at sea, his momentum was like a broken bamboo, how proud he was. However, when he returned to Zhenjiang, he encountered Han Shizhong's army. In one battle, his soldiers were defeated and his generals were killed, and his son-in-law, the Dragon and Tiger King, was also captured. So he begged for mercy from Han's army, willing to offer all the things he had plundered in Jiangnan to Han's army. Han did not allow it, and offered famous horses, but he still did not allow it, and asked to meet with Shizhong to beg for forgiveness. From this, the Jin army's cowardly state can be seen.</p>
<p>Wuzhu had 100,000 elite troops. He was defeated at Huang Tiandang and defeated by Yue Fei at Niutoushan, Jiankang. However, the Jin troops were able to come from the north because the Han traitors used rockets to break through the heavy land and water defenses. This proves that the Song army only had tactics but no strategy, and could not have a lasting, comprehensive, and complete plan. However, it is better to say that the Song court had no strategy than to say that the Song army had no strategy.</p>
<p>However, the fact that Han Shizhong and Liang Hongyu used 8,000 troops from a defeated country to resist Wuzhu's 100,000 troops for forty-eight days is of great significance.</p>
<p>When we present the heroic story of Liang Hongyu beating the drums to repel the Jin soldiers on the stage in the form of a drama, we must emphasize the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The contradiction between the pro-peace faction and the pro-war faction; the absurdity and shamelessness of the pro-peace faction and fear of Jin; the anti-war strength shown when the pro-war faction takes the upper hand.</p>
<p>(2) The demands of Han Shizhong and Liang Hongyu, in line with the demands of the military and civilians, are full of unyielding determination to strive for victory.</p>
<p>(3) The expansion, treachery, ambition, cruelty, and weaknesses of the Jin soldiers.</p>
<p>(4) Resisting the Jin soldiers was the common responsibility of the military and civilians of the Song Dynasty at that time.</p>
<p>(5) The Jin soldiers can be overcome, and the Song Dynasty can be revived.</p>
<p>(6) Others.</p>
<p>The overall task is to show the strength of the Song Dynasty in resisting Jin, and to objectively criticize its mistakes, and to "visualize" all of this.</p>
<p>In fact, history is just history. History itself is a scripture and lesson that can be mutually verified and explained with current events, or give us a reference, but it must never be confused with current events. Our current war of resistance is a war of a small and weak nation against fascism. This is completely different from the Song-Jin War. Our nationwide adherence to the strategy and tactics of a protracted war and a comprehensive war is planned and progressive. This simply cannot be compared with the Song court, which was undecided on whether to wage war or seek peace. Our enemy, Japan, is a capitalist country with considerable economic progress. This is also incomparable to the Jin Dynasty, a fishing and nomadic nation. We are a large and weak country with a relatively backward economy, but we can progress and strengthen during the war. Japan is a strong country with a relatively advanced economy, but it can degenerate and weaken during the war. These are also different from the situation of both Song and Jin.</p>
<p>These are just to express a point of view on how to deal with historical materials, and do not have to be set out in the script. We invite you to watch the historical drama and let the audience use his own feelings and thoughts to accept the enlightenment of history!</p>
<p>We Extend Our Sympathy</p>
<p>Foreword: The establishment of Dadi Film Company in Hong Kong can be said to be a meaningful work that marks an era in the film industry in South China. Regarding this, we have already introduced it in the 24th issue of this magazine. In this article, we can reflect on how obscene and shameless one side is, and how solemn the work is on the other. At the same time, we can see their correct attitude and the spirit of hard work and struggle towards film production in the future! This is a declaration of determination and a bugle call to arms! For the future of true national defense art and for the sacred national liberation struggle, we feel infinite excitement and joy. Therefore, without avoiding the suspicion of publicity, we are eager to reprint it, and hope that readers will not ignore it!</p>

<h3>We Need Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Cai Chusheng</p>
<p>Lifting my head from continuous, sleepless, and foodless work, grasping this pen again, I want to write something. Although I feel an inescapable fatigue, I also feel an indescribable excitement—besides, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Fei Mu saying something that was not publicly stated (it was at a gathering for the film industry hosted by Mr. Xu Hao): "Starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a great matter." These words at the time made me deeply resonate and almost brought me to tears. Although he didn't say it outright, he was secretly putting it into practice. But in this "degenerate world" (this phrase may still not be enough to describe it?), some people consider "starving to death" even "greater" than "losing integrity." Therefore, speaking can be as irresponsible as farting. Any beautiful terms or pleasant words can be brought out and used by people who don't know what shame is, to deceive others and also to deceive themselves! Are they human words or ghost words? Perhaps many people can't figure it out? Sometimes, even a common phrase that is only at the lowest level, if people are to actually implement it, becomes something more difficult than beheading. From this point of view, Mr. Fei Mu should be regarded as a fool, and our group who have long been judged as "bound to starve to death" are naturally not worth a thing!</p>
<p>However, the truth and justice of the world, before humanity can return to the prehistoric age of beasts, will one day be upheld. Just like after a long dark night, or a storm, or a period of gloom, the warm sunshine will surely shine upon the earth again; just like throughout history, countless invaders, large and small, although temporarily rampant to the extreme, will one day embark on the path of total collapse and destruction. These are inevitable and very natural things. Therefore, we need not tremble or be timid. We should strengthen our faith with unchanging determination, for truth and justice.</p>
<p>"Dadi" (The Earth) is a new organization established in this dark and oppressive atmosphere, unafraid of any difficulty. It does not contain any "worldly wise" "clever people," nor does it have any substantial capital that can make people "lose their souls." It doesn't even dream of becoming some "artistic power" (if there is even art in China) or commercial "trust" in the future. All it has is a group of "big kids"—a kind of spirit of struggling without knowing the hardships and difficulties of the world. At the same time, it does not have any "lofty" ambitions. It just wants to do some ordinary things that every "person" should do. To put it more clearly, we will adhere to the position of artists (if there are artists) in the "extraordinary period," and under the principle of not obliterating "artistic conscience," we will devote our greatest efforts to our work. To put it even more clearly, we will use practical actions to prove the truth of what we said in the past, which some people considered "just beautiful words," or which some people have "laughed and cursed" at. But we have no malice. On the contrary, we sincerely and with goodwill hope that those who have doubted us will have a day of "realizing that the present is right and the past was wrong," and jointly engage in efforts towards the same goal.</p>
<p>Our work has begun. Our manpower and resources are very limited, and our intelligence is even more limited. We are still young and naive, and we need the enthusiastic support and sincere guidance of those who are wise. We vow not to be "Ah Q's self-satisfaction," nor "megaphones for the oppressor"! If our work is not considered meaningless, then I would like to sincerely ask the gentlemen and ladies who read this article to give us fervent sympathy and encouragement, to regard "Dadi" as your "Dadi." And I—one of the workers in the "Dadi" group—will work with my comrades, sleeplessly and neglecting meals, to work even harder and more vigorously, to repay your expectations to the best of our ability!</p>
