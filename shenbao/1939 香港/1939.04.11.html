<p>社評</p>
<h3>集體侵略與集體安全</h3>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞又是在孤立地，毫無外援的情勢下，被黑衫宰相的鐵拳所征服了。阿國是在二十四小時亡國的，這更是一椿可怡的事件。但這事件本卽無足驚奇，只是富有深刻的教訓罷了。</p>
<p>我們對於這一事件的第一個認識是：莫索里　的侵阿，是繼希特勒吞併捷克而起的，同時，二者又完全是同一性質的行動。希特勒吞併捷克後卽便擬定「第二次侵略計劃」，內開意大利應該收囘的殖民地及權益，並且一再演說，鼓動莫索里尼起來爭奪，刦略，所以莫索里尼侵略阿爾巴尼亞與希希勒之吞併捷克，可以視爲强盜集團的同一侵略行動。</p>
<p>第二個認識是：莫索里尼的作風正與希特勒一樣，採取「避實擊虛」的辦法。在不久以前，莫索里尼頗有北進以威脅法國勢力圈的情勢。當時有一部份人疑慮莫索里尼的北進將使意大利與法國發生正面的衝突，點着了歐洲的火藥庫。但是結果呢，它却改北進為東進，在迅雷不及掩耳之間佔領了阿爾巴尼亞的全部領土，並將三萬大軍　飛運」入阿，一部分部隊且已於昨日下午開入離南斯拉夫邊境僅五英里的斯庫泰里。這正和希特勒之吞捷克併立陶宛，威脅羅馬尼亞是同一步驟。不過，我們須承認：世界侵略者的侵略决不停止於蠶蝕弱小國家而已，其先選擇弱小國家的原因，在於自身力量的薄弱，蓋欲用以培植自己的力量，待到羽毛豐滿，體壯力健的時侯，它們又必很自然地進一步旗強者的英法角鬥，以爭取歐洲的支配權。蠶蝕弱小國家，不過是與強大國家角鬥的準備工作罷了。</p>
<p>現在處在歐洲侵略者的威脅之下的國家，雖有時間上前後的不同，但是全歐的大小國家已經沒有不在岌岌可危了。只是從來抵抗侵略者的方法是各自為政的，孤立的，結果在強權壓迫之下做了犧牲品。弱小國家與弱小國家之閒沒有攻守同盟的保障，大國對小國的保障又不可靠，缺欠誠意，所以弱小國家，就難免於被侵略者個個擊破的運命了。阿爾巴尼亞皇后在其亡命希臘之後發表談話謂：『阿爾巴尼亞，對此強暴武力，何能抵抗？吾希望能因吾弱邦之橫被侵略，而促英國輿論之正義呼聲』。語雖簡單，但却極其沉痛而值得玩味。倘若執歐洲政治的牛耳的英法，不能坦誠而且積極保衛其他弱小的和平國家，則歐洲的弱小國家在最近的將來不知將再減少幾個！</p>
<p>英國政府當局最近已稍為希特勒及莫索里尼的侵略鐵拳所嚇醒，已允為羅馬尼亞及波蘭保證，並與波蘭締結互助協定，現又與希臘，羅馬尼亞，七耳其，及蘇聯各國，分別進行接洽。惟我們感於英國前此對弱小國家保證之常流於空虛，不兌現，仍覺英國有更進一步的必要。同時，弱小諸國更須自動地發議弱小國家彼此互助的具體辦法。蘇聯對於集體抵抗侵略者的必要，感覺最為深刻，東歐諸小國應先謀諸蘇聯，以促成集體安全制之實現。</p>
<p>世界強盜的侵略既是以集團的行動表演的，那末被侵略國家的抵抗也要出以集團的行動，始能有效，否則，堵截這一方面的侵略，別方面的侵略又將隨之而起。被侵略者的抵抗須處於同一威脅下的國家共同奮起，採取齊一的行動始可。倘如過去英國那樣，當莫索里尼北向威脅法國的時侯忙於對意。當希特勒發動，納粹十字軍東征」的時侯，則又只注意到德國的侵略，這樣單獨的分別的東西奔忙的堵塞，結果只坐大了世界的侵略者。今日唯一有效的辦法，就是愛好和平的國家趕快奮起，不分東西，不存舊時的猜忌，團結一致地結成一個健全的一集體安全制」，以集團的行動抵抗集團的侵略。在這個集體安全制的建設上，不能够使美國處於集體之外，在抵抗集團侵略上，更不能够忘記了遠東的日本侵略者的行為了。</p>
<h3>百歲三年馬相伯先生</h3>
<p>— 于右任</p>
<p>吾師馬相伯先生，生於遜淸道光之二十年（一八四〇），至今民國二十八年（一九三九年），蓋已大壽一百歲矣，先生以一代之帥宗，享大齊之遐祉，其文章道德，與先數年來對於國家民族之建樹，殆非　席楮墨所能傾寫，顧余則以為百歲靑年之一詞實足以舉而賅括之，余之致語以壽先生也，　曰民挨一元老，精神常少年，此種少年精神，則卽先生條已立人成功之源泉，是以形容其整個之人格者也，試以先生之生平與世俗所謂壽翁香老較之，　世俗所謂壽翁耆老。有一通行之概念焉，則功成身退，歲居以盡大年是也，書稱耄期　於勤，謂舜以年老倦於攻書也，禮稱休老勞農，謂老年之人，官使之休暇安息也，鄭　成之為戒子書也，年纔七，耳，而日案之禮典須合傳家，告　以老，歸爾以事，蓋人之精神，不能不受其生理組織之支配，既達一定年齡，則生理機能，减其作用，而精神亦處於退櫻之狀態也，惟先生則不然，不特期頤之年，精神固護，有逾少壯，其一生之盛業馮烈，且多在中年以後，常人所指為桑榆暮景之時，而始發靭，則今日巍然為國中學府重鎭之復旦大學，人莫不知為先生所手創，由先生之心血培養　溉而成，然先生之創立復且，與其前身之震旦學院時，其年則已將七十矣，當余之肄業於震旦也，其校舍則假徐家匯天文臺之故址為之，無自置之室　也，其教授則由耶穌會之諸神甫及修士任之，無經常之欵產也，先生白髮盈顚，以一身楮柱其閒，蓋不知其幾反艱苦，幾經挫折，然先生終維日孜孜，樂之而不疲，其後之別創復　也，其校舍之苟簡，與師資之難得，又遠遜於震旦，先生以　然一老，與十數門弟子呼號奔走於經紳官吏之間，其所歷之艱苦，與所經之挫折，且較創立震旦時而過之，然先生仍維日孜孜，樂之而不疲，此維日孜孜，不厭不倦之精神，則卽余之所謂少年精神，而先生一生盡瘁於國家民族之原動力也，先生生乎外患頻仍在世其愛國保種撥亂反正之心，尤老當益壯，終始不渝，當先生之奉使於高　也，日本帝國主義，亦已漸露兇鋒，駸駸乎　陵上國之勢，先生憂時念亂，洞燭機先，旣以其策陳諸中　當局而不見聽，則退而講學於海上，思以百年樹人之計，植民族復興之基，此即震旦復旦兩大學創立之動機也，震旦之立，時黨人志士，多負笈來會，先生旣倣歐美大學教育成材之制，手定踝程，自為解講，尤必於每星期日，集諸生于一堂，詔以種族之大義，定攘之重任，當先生登壇說法時，髯髯戟張，忠義憤發，吾人追憶及之，猶不勝其感奮，詎知先生此時，已為一年近七十之老翁哉，及民國成立，先生從遊諸弟子，多能本其師說，為黨國效力，斯時先生之心，亦為之稍慰，自於民元一赴南京，出主市政，然日人以我革命勢力突起，足妨其大陸政策之進展，故其謀我也亦奮亟，自二十一條件以至濟南慘案，其閒陰謀毒螫，步步進逼，幾乎年不絕　，先生奔馳南北，日震其雷霆鐘呂之音，為喚起民衆之工作，不以年事之高，圖一日之暇逸，及九一八變起，先生憤慨尤甚，其在海上卽領導靑年，使其同仇敵愾之心，納於精誠團結，一致禦侮之正軌中，後安車　道，來居首都，習贊中樞，奠抗戰建國之大計，蓋先生終民二十五年十二月入京，翌年一月，選任國府委員，其年則已九十八矣，昔伏年遂九十，口授尙書，馬授據鞍，　　，以示可用，當時俱戰諸史聞，傳為美談，今先生之年既遠過之，且心雄萬夫，無時不立於民挨鬥爭最前之一線，將來載籍流傳，或且視為奇蹟，覆實論之，則亦吾之所謂少年精神為之耳，吾故曰，此少年精神之保持，實為先生一生成功之源泉，足以形容其整個之人格者也。</p>
<p>抑先生稀世之高齡，猶能保持此少年精神，為國家民族努力者，與其宗教信仰，尤有深切之關係，蓋人之精神，雖受物質條件之支配，而信仰之篤，執德之堅，亦往往能轉弱為强，回復靑春時代之勇氣，反之，而灰滅小乘之消極思想，亦能使人暮氣日深，成望秋先零之弱者，道家者，世之慕此生久視之術者之擬宗也，然其養生之方，則在墮聰塞明，致靈守靜，以保其玄牝食母，莊周稱林類百歲，其得壽之由，在少不勤行，長不競時，信如是也，是形體雖具，精神早已死亡，又何以異於土槐木偶哉，先生為輸入西洋科學之先進，除博通古今方言外，於名數歷象之學，著作流布，造脂甚深，顧於羅馬正教，則受之髫歲，篤信力行，始終勿懈，故常能以耶蘇之積極人生觀，為其立身處世，受用不盡之資糧，猶意先生講學於震事時，侯官嚴氏，另將英人斯賓塞爾之醫譯布于世，先生對及門諸子，辨之甚力，在篤時學術界，幾成兩大分野，是豈先生駕時拘靈，好存門戶之見哉，亦以斯氏為英國正統派之哲學，其學毗於唯物，理障甚多，而嚴氏又以老莊之學傅益之，足以阻承學進城之勇氣耳，此種積極奮鬥之宗教信仰，則又先生所以能保持少年精砷之故，而為吾儕景仰先生，資為立身矩護之人所不可不知者也。</p>
<p>如上所述，但舉少年精神一義，以概括先生之生平，于先生之嘉言　行，自難得其巨，然高山景行，其則不遠，今當精神動員，爭取抗戰勝利之時，設吾人能由此一義效法先生，請獻其身於國家民族，使先生以百歲高斷，早覩中興之治，則余之此文，庶幾其不虛作，而不致以曲解師說，為先生可訶歟。</p>
<h3>今後的難民救濟工作</h3>
<p>【桂林通訊】難民，在日本法西斯蒂軍關砲火中跑出來的難民，不願做順民，不願做奴隸，而願意流亡，而願意為祖國生存，為民族解放抗戰的同胞一起奮鬥。所以，不顧一切拋開可愛的家鄉，向內地流浪的難民，他們雖然沒有上戰場，雖然沒有直接參加戰爭，可是他們能够决心丟掉祖宗世代傳留的田土而流亡，給予敵人一片焦土。這樣為抗戰而犧牲，為生存而忍受痛苦的精神，值得我們的敬愛，同時，他們的流亡生活，應該給予同情，安慰，給予更多的帮助和救濟。</p>
<p>幾百萬的難民，分散在我們的後方，因為我們的救濟方法和力量，由於人事系統與組織機構關係，不能完全做到理想中所希望的，使流離失所的難民。受到更多的痛苦，這是我們沒有做難民的人，應該致無限的歉疚，但是不能否認了，我們政府盡了相當的力量來救濟，在一般的難　印象中，根據他們的流亡經驗，覺得廣西對救濟難民比較負責</p>
<p>來到桂林的難民，多數是亡家最早蘇浙皖人，他們由南昌長沙衡陽到桂林。這些停留在桂林的難民，經過幾番流徙，他們沒有勇氣作更遠的流亡。因為四負錢走二百里路的味道嘗多了。同時，他們也覺得長期難民生活的無耶。經濟狀況比較好一點的，經營小生意，桂林火車站旁的小商店，便是他們所創設。消極的乘湘桂路浙桂通車囘上海去了，甚至還有人去上海辦婚服來桂林結婚，只有那些逃難逃窮了的難民，還依賴難民收容所過日子，每天大人二角，小孩一角五分的生活費。但是，十六歲以下，六十歲以上的男子，初進收容所可領三天生活費，此外，只有希望病倒，可以領生活費。使有生產力的壯年人以工作來解决生活，在救濟規則上是台理的。</p>
<p>廣西的救濟難民，能够做到負責，這是與以下級政治基礎健全，　潔政治作風有關係。來桂林的難民，自十一月至今年三月五日止有九千五百零五固，沒有經過雞民管理登記的約在三千多個。難民最多的時期，是長沙大火後的十一月份內，有四千多難民入境，廣西難民救濟會搭起七個難民柵，在桂林城外收容，民政　雷　長一早去數民總站　料分送難民到收容所，許多顚沛流離的難民，在一位年老的官吏熱忱招待中，得看熱烈的安慰，領會到國家的可愛，當初難民每天分　分，一角和一角五分三種，由於桂林物價的高昂，和難民的要求，現在增加了五分，大人（老弱婦女）每天二角，小孩每天一角五分，柴米油監那在這份錢裏分配。</p>
<p>在桂林以墾植來救濟難民的有馮玉祥先生方振武先生和省政府辦的柳州鳳山河四個墾植區，良豐的墾植場收容安徽巢縣鳳陽等縣難民，大壚的收容山東難民，鳳山河的墾植區，專為收容難民去開墾，但是，報名的人很少。因為（一）有勞力的難民，從事於苦力工作，暫維生活，企待囘家。（二）中產階級的份子多，不能耕種。（三）不習慣廣西的氣候土質和農其。同時報名採取自由方式，沒有政治力量去宣傳，去鼓動</p>
<p>廣西政府為了同情亡家的難民，不忍强迫他們去種田。去做工，即使給他們介紹了工作，難民認為做不了，也並不一定勉强。為不願做勞苦工作的難民設想，向中央振委會請求專欵發給難民，在指定的區域街道兩旁空地借地建屋。每戶（五人一戶）可領三十元，（每人六元）建築費。並且還辦營業小本貨欵，使難民可以自練生活。這種較有積極性的救濟辦法，是值得指出的。現在有百餘閒的新草栩搭起，今天是臨時的客居，長久以後，他們的家譜十要多添一個支脈在廣西，將來是新中國人口大變遷史上的重要考據。</p>
<p>難民也有自己的組織，互助社，難民合作社，由難民入股滿一百元基金。政府允許他們在收容所開辦合作社，供慶難民柴米油　菜等的生活消費品。</p>
<p>在後方，各地政府用了很大的力量來救濟，就是在戰地，我們部隊長官派政治工作員沿路招待。可以說對難民救濟工作想出了許多方法。我們希望一面救濟，一面組織，把教濟的意義範圍擴大，應該把它着作抗戰建國事業中的重要工作之一。長期性的戰爭，我們的戰區還要繼續擴大，受難同胞必然的要增加，過去二十個月的戰爭，不能否認×人殘暴的姦淫燒殺，促進了我們的民族醒覺，加强了我們一般民衆的×愾心理。今天×人除繼續其殘暴政策外，同時採用假仁假義的恩惠主義，收買人心，實行他們的政治侵略。像最近在鄂中進攻鐘祥的敵人，表面上對民衆裝得絲逢無犯，欺騙和麻醉我們的同胞，爭取支持抗戰最力的勞動羣衆不逃難，便於敵入建立偽政權，實行經濟榨取政策。我們一方面要求軍隊能切實做到軍民合作，注意軍國耘。一方面希望救濟難民工作，配台二期抗戰中的政治，軍事，經濟，教育來與敵人的政治進攻，作正面的攻擊。</p>
<p>我們的救濟難民工作，要以積極的政治建設性的救濟來替單純的慈善觀念的救濟意義。</p>
<p>在救　範圍上，　分成後方與　不。戰爭的性質是全面戰爭，動爭的狀態是犬牙交錯的戰爭。難民的救濟和收容，不允許我們在比較安全的後方來收容救濟難民，應該在淪陷的戰區設立戰地難民救濟委員會，協助戰地黨政委員會進行動員組織　衆，以救濟難民帮助軍民間合作。負責的護送戰地難民到後方收容所。在後方的應該與當地的工廠農場生產部門，交通機關，工會，學校取得密切聯糸，調查各團體機關中所需要的人才，再把難民中適宜該項工作的分別介紹工作，各團體機關應有儘先收用難民的義務。比如在桂林車站上有很多的難民想去搬運行李和貨物，可是爲了沒有加入苦力工會，只能在組織的本地苦力羣中分得一肩半担，有時不能挑進城，而車站方面顧全旅客的便利，軍用品敏捷的搬運，需要很多的勞工，想把難民組織起來，又恐怕與地方組織相衝突，因此請求軍事機關派輸送兵在車站搬送軍用品和挑送行李，希望以勞力謀生的難民，表示感慨『同鄉中沒有有力的人出來給我們說話』要是救濟會與各團體機關有聯繫和合作　那麽，這些勞苦難民可以組織一個『難民勞動工作團』靠車站上搬運，維持生活，甚至一家人也可得到温飽，像這樣的例子是很多，所以我們希望救濟難民工作，積極的站在介紹工作上，同時，不應該為了沒有登記，沒有難民條子，就不救濟，只要是亡了家的難民，卽使有某些弱點，我們可以用政治或組織方法去調整，用教育的力量去感化，更不該說是壯年人不救濟就是養成他們不依賴性，算盡了救濟目的，我們要幫助壯年人適當的解决工作，使一家人能自己生活，這才算眞正的救濟，眞正的愛護抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>救濟難民的工作，我們希望不單單成為　央單獨的慈善事業，應該看作抗戰　　一件重要工作之一。救亡閣體也應參加救濟會去難民羣中宣傳，慰間，組織和調查，去做政治工作，提高他們的抗戰意　。和　產總　，銀行　合作金庫應該作無利息的放飲，加强難民　植場的經濟基礎，多量的收容難民去關墾，安定雖　的生活　使他們能安心　植，提高他們的生產　　　發展農業經濟。同時，動　各　鄉會的財產來救濟難民，開辦工廠，　塲，安置同鄉難民，辦理學校教育羅　，最好由地方政府統辦。這個時候，不動用會館力量來參加建國事業，那麼，這種會館存在的意義便太小了。江蘇旅桂向鄉會已經由江蘇人代表願　若先生等起來改組，要求把財產交管理委員會辦理救濟江蘇難民，雖然還沒有做出很好的成績。但是，他們的意思是一切實際的。同時廣西當局，為了難童的教育問題，發動各省旅桂同鄉會起來合辦一們難童學校。因為許多婦女不願把兒童送進教育院，有些為了生活，要他們到街頭上賣柚子賣紙煙，所以採取折衷辦法，用同鄉會去辦理，使難童有敎育機會，但是我們希望由局部轉到整個的統一教養，像保育院一樣，全部交給國家教養，把不能工作的老弱婦女另外牧養以减輕男子祖負。</p>
<p>總之新階段中的抗戰建國工作需要有各方面的配合。我們要以攻勢政治，去擊破×人的政治侵略，爭取民衆。孤立×人，救濟難民工作必須要有計劃的有組織的　有統一的負責的救濟辦洗，給子難民生命的安全保陣，戰時的政治教育和生產技術的訓練，使每個難民的力量都貢獻到抗戰工作上來！這是一種人力動員的辦法，他是一種最實際動員的辦法。（秋江於三月廿四日）</p>
<h3>湘桂路上的衡陽　中國之友中國（四）</h3>
<p>— 葉厥孫</p>
<p>大約八點鐘了，他倆還依然睡得很好，在上舖的我，也只好免强再睡一會兒。結果還是李蒙太太早起，我們亦隨之下床。逐漸地接近湖南了，氣候也轉變得比較寒冷起來。湘桂路的兩傍多山，右　與湖南交界的地方有都靦左邊則是越城嶺。山旁盡是黃色的土坡，沿着這　土坡的起　已建許許多多的茅房，草棚。這多半是江浙一帶浪亡至此的難民們經　的。敵人摧毀了他們的老家，因此，不得不尋求新的安身之處。沿鐵路綫而居，不但可以解決住的問題，並旦帶便做點小買賣便可解决了所謂『生活』。湘桂路幫助了流浪中的難民，難民也促進湘桂路沿途的繁榮。</p>
<p>火車跨進南省境，在零陵縣的冷水灘　下了，車站兩旁的田野裏皆在忙着訓練新兵，有的已換上了軍裝，有的依然穿着便服像个百姓。有的還在學習徒手的基本動作，有的已操練到持鎗的目苗準姿勢。許多不同程度的隊伍在做着不同的操作，可是他們的精神是同樣抵抖　。舉動是一樣地靈敏。湘桂路的每一个小站上，都密佈着　在鍛鍊中的新兵和從他們口中發出來的雄偉歌聲。無疑地，他們皆是第二期抗戰中的主力。「中國的確有　不可思議」到處表示出有着無限不可征服的蘊潛力。</p>
<p>水田裏農夫農婦們在勤奮地耕作，牧童騎在半背上愉快地歌唱，火車　遼遠的前程奔跑，大自然始終保持着　靜寞寂，我們三人同　視着窗外，李蒙拍了下我的背膊，他說；『中國在實的偉大；』我說；『這一切織成了湘桂路上新的風景綫』這兩句話似乎有點牛頭不對馬嘴，關聯不上，可是，在當時的境地和情況下，確實足以反應每一个人內心所要說的話。</p>
<p>天氣格外冷了，我們在客廳裏互相以　鬥的姿勢，跳躍着取暖，反正車廂裏也無更多的旅客。下午二點多鐘，火車到達衡陽。</p>
<p>繼長沙大火之後，衡陽不獨成為粵漢綫上的軍事重鎭，同時更為這一覆地方的商業中心，交通要道。粵漢路北可達長沙，南至廣東的韶關，東有公路由街陽經泉溪，茶陵人江西省境而抵南昌，西面則有湘桂路，直通桂林。並且，在夏秋水漲的時候，衡陽還是湘江上小汽輪的終點。是後方，同時也是前綫。長沙大火，曲江屢遭狂炸，故這兩个地方昔日的商業精華。現皆遷栘到衡陽。這無異把古舊的衡州府，披上了一件戰時的新裝。街面上擠滿着行人，處處皆是繁盛的商店，在某他地方買不到的東西，在此地皆可以買，並且價格也很便宜。原因是香港的貨特可在汕頭進口，汕頭有公路到韶關。至於由韶關到衡陽那，自然十分方便惠司忌，白蘭地，以及各式各樣的啤酒，呵。呵咖啡，和一切的罐頭食品，女人的三花牌花粉，胭脂，蔻卅……莫不應有盡有。故防止×貨輸運入境和改換商標假冒等事情已成為當地抗×後援會的工作之一。</p>
<p>在街道上，茶館桌我們到處可以看見從前綫受傷歸來的士兵。是的，因為地理和交通運輸上的關係，衡陽已成為容納傷兵的重要尾閭，韶關，長沙，南昌等綫下來的弟兄皆集中此地。然後，再由　陽把他們疏散到，湘西，廣西等地，目前在衡陽的傷兵當還有二萬多人，他們大部份皆是在第一時期戰役中受傷的，現在差不多皆已痊愈，祇等待着新的編制，參加隊伍，好重上戰場殺×。</p>
<p>衡陽不單是傷兵的重要疏散站，同時更為各綫部隊輸送的必經之地。所以當我們渡過湘江上的浮橋，跑　對河粵漢路車站附近的時候，便可看見不少關於軍民合作，和歡迎從前綫歸來的將士的　語，並且，到處鄱還設有傷兵招待所，這種大半都是粵漢路員工抗×後援　幹的，他們還組織了不少的輸送隊，自備帆布床，專門抬從火軍裏下來的弟兄們進醫院。的確抗戰中粵漢路的員工們已表顯了非常光輝的工作成績，和服務精神，廣州在慌張中宣告淪陷的時候，他們便組織了十八隊搶救隊，專門負責破壞橋樑以阻止×人前進，各搶救停留在廣州附近各站的車頭，故廣州之失守雖出人意料之外地迅速，而粵漢路車頭和列車的損失却是微乎其微，這種非常的收獲，不能不說是路工們英勇奮鬥的具體表現。</p>
<p>駐衡陽的部隊，××師，是參加了武漢會戰之後，才來到此地的，部隊裏的中下級幹部皆為中央軍校的畢業生，和以往十九路軍的舊屬，不是受過嚴格的軍事教育，便是有充份的作戰經驗的，故××師雖已轉戰於上海，魯南。山西，以及武漢等戰場，屢次皆不免稍有捐失，可是，因為有了堅强的幹部，新力量便可很快地補充和長成了，記者曾參觀過他們的操練，弟兄皆為精壯的山東，湖南人，動作極為熱練，精神十分煥奮，配備亦很完善。打通事漢路是×人的夢想之一，我們拋開了一切地　上的困難不講，單憑沿路各地準備有素。而殺×情緒極高的幾十萬弟兄，就可完全粉碎敵人的夢想。</p>
<p>新聯事業在衡陽亦算相當發達，此地有大鋼報和正中日報，篇幅相當大（一張四版）內容亦甚充實，牠們隔日便能銷售於韶關長沙的市場，据說每天可賣三四仟份，在目前，報細多半被限止於地方性之際，能有三四仟份的銷路，實在不能說是太壞了了！</p>
<p>×機是决不會輕意放過任何一個後方都市的，衡陽亦蒙　們光顧過一次，雖然損失還不及桂林，貴陽，韶關等處大。然未雨得先綢繆，有計劃地把商業市場疏散到四鄉去，的確是長期抗戰中經濟戰的重要戰望當局加以注意，似避免不必要的損失。</p>
<p>三教咖啡館是衡陽最好的西菜餐室，在它那酒吧間的廚架上，我們可以看得到五顏六色，各種不同的酒瓶和罐頭。以酒講，至少亦在十種以上，這種規模的菜館，若在平時的話，决至不會開設在衡陽，因為那時候有錢的人多在上海，廣州……等入都市。從這種瑣碎的地方看，抗戰已促進了內地的繁華。不獨是政治就是經濟也已開　在抗戰中建立起新的基礎，新的姿態，由重重受帝國主義勢力控制的都市貿易而轉變為內地的獨立的民族生產，這自然是非常可喜的現象，衡陽的警備司令李精一先生就在清裏招　我們晚餐，本來這不過是很平常的友誼表示，不過以談話的內容看來，倒好似有點像國際會議前的咖啡室談話，彼此願意交換各自的情况，談話大概可以分為兩部，李蒙百先採取攻勢，先問李精一司令關於岳州日軍後此的動向，是否要沿粵　南路下呢？李精一的回答大概是這樣的：長沙以北的鉄路已　底破壞，由長沙到漢口的公路也都已破壞，並且這一綫駐有重兵如關麟徵吳其偉等皆　戰之士，加以岳州以南，地勢東部高而西部低，故我們還可利用山地佈防，敵人若眞想要從岳州攻長沙，卽必　　硬仗，並且必然還是吃　多，得益少。所以，依我個人看來，敵人的企圖將會出洞庭湖沿沅江而進攻常德。因為，一則敵人已取得了洞庭湖之口的岳州，這隊長沙已多少減低其在軍事上的重要性，這和敵人控制了鄱陽湖之口的九江而南昌遂處於次要地位是一樣的。二則，取得常德之後不單可以空制湘西，並且還可以直接威脅貴州和四川，因爲川湘公路和　湘公路皆到達於常德。三則以進攻路綫購，水陸並進是敵人償用的戰術。況常德桃源一帶的江水漲時還可通小　船和橡皮艇。然以整个戰局看起來，敵人員前還是舉棋未定的時候。原因當然是力量分散了，進攻更感困難。此外李先生還講了點關於西南和西北的國際路綫問題，很明顯的，敵人是無法可以切斷中口這兩條交通動脈。接　是這位靑年將軍有了个反攻的轉機地便問李蒙，為什麼法國對於日本在遠東的行動處處表示着退　和胆怯？　（未完）</p>

<h3>農民救亡運動在晉西北</h3>
<p>在一年來的苦鬥中，一支新的抗戰隊伍成長起來了。——三十萬曾經是封建和侵略者的奴隸，今日高擎起抗戰的旗幟，過着組織的，鬥爭的生活。在他們週圍，緊密的團結着三百萬作為後備軍的羣衆。這是今日晉西北抗日戰線上的農民救亡運動的輪廓。在抗戰陣營中，道是不容忽視的一支生力軍，是晉西北抗日根据地的柱石，山西的屏陣。</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>晉四北是一個遼闊的地區，包括三十七縣，東傍同蒲路，南逾晉西公路。介休石樓公路一帶。×寇血腥的鐵蹄，曾經踏遍了這槐潔凈土地，現在大半還在×區裏。由於呂梁山脉縱橫境內，交通僻塞，文化水準異常落後。但是，自太原失陷後才出現的農救會（農民救國會的簡稱）的組織。現在却幾乎普遍的繁殖在每一個村落裏。</p>
<p>晋西北可以說完全是農業地區，所以農救會是這裏最有力的組織，只要是從事農業勞動的，在『抗日救國，增進儂民知識，改善農民生活，以及改良農業技術』的宗旨之下，都有入會的資格。依照年齡，性別及個人的興趣，同時他們也可以是老年隊，兒童團和靑救會婦救會的組成份子。</p>
<p>晉西北三十七縣農救聯合會便是領導統一的最高組織。各級組織與工作作風，大都採取委員及民主集中制。各村農救會脫離生產的僅一人，其他幹部都是完全盡義務，只向各會員收一個銅　的會費，來作為一切辦公費等的開支。就縣農救會，每個工作者一天僅僅五分錢的菜和一斤四兩筱麵的低微生活費，可是工作的熱忱，絲毫沒有鬆懈的情形。</p>
<p>工作</p>
<p>由於環境的不同，各縣農救會年餘來的工作成績。以及現在努力的工作，多少總是有着差別。不過它們工作上的原則，却都是一樣。除了　救會的宗旨之外，還特別提出了幾點——關于農救會應有的立場及態度，那就是：服從政府的政治領導。恊助政府，使抗戰建國綱領民族革命十大綱領及其他法令等順利的實現；在民族利益高于一切的前提下，農民本身特殊利益。要在抗戰過程中爭取；農救會已取得合法的地位；要保持其獨立性。現在綜合各縣農救會的工作於下面：</p>
<p>（一）動員農民武裝在晋西北，直到現在仍然沒有實行徽兵制，每次新戰士的動員，都是按照當時軍隊需要的補充額，分配給各縣一定的動員數目，再由各地行政機關，需要補充的軍隊，會同各民運團體來進行的。農救會與民關係的密切，因而對于這一工作特別努力，使每一個新戰士都自動入伍，且每次的動員，常常不到預定的日期便完成了</p>
<p>國民抗×自衛團（卽過去不脫離生產村自衛隊）的建立，農救會每一個會員都極熱心的恊助了政府來進行。在團裏面，他們起着模範與領導的作用。放哨檢查行人；建立了通訊和運送隊…一封鷄毛信的傳遞比郵政還要來的快；負傷戰士從戰綫上迅速運到後方醫院；後方的給　迅速的輸送到戰塲：這完全倚仗着各村自衛團力量的發揮。</p>
<p>（二）改善農民生活　合理負担，雖然很早就在這裏實行了，但是起初某些地方頑固的富有者，仗勢不肯多出錢，弄得合理負祖變成了按戶平均　派；某些地方只是少數富有者來負担，致演出宮有者逃往×區的事情；不要然便是因為分配份數不公平，而弄出　多糾紛來。農救會糾正了這些不良的現象，他們會同其他民運團體，協助當地的政府，來召集民衆開會，評定每戶實在應攤派份數，並通過每一個村民，使這一負担逐漸變得合理了。</p>
<p>對於減租減息，取消高利貸的實行，農救會更不辭艱苦的向地主債主宣傳；此外集欵組織農民產消合作社，免除奸商的漁利和操縱；請求政府設立了借貸所，以信用借給貧農糧食或軟項；其他設水利委員會，提倡小手工業，禁宰耕牛開墾等工作，都有相當的成績。</p>
<p>優待抗戰軍人家屬，農救會及其他民運團體却供獻了許多的功績。他們發動給抗戰軍人家屬製造『民族英雄』的牌區，對貧者家屬借給或者捐募給來糧，一般的把中狄節定為優待抗戰軍人家屬節，舉行茶話會慰問抗戰軍人的家屬。組織代耕隊，無論春耕或秋收都盡先替抗戰軍人家屬耕種收割。因此每個戰士都除了家庭的顧慮，新戰士的動員得到了英大的幫助。</p>
<p>（三）軍民合作　農救會發動軍隊參加春耕和秋收運動，常常地召開軍民聯歡大會，經常地募捐欵項粮秣，或縫製衣服鞋襪，慰勞前綫的作戰將十及負傷者，自然　樣使過去軍民水火的關係，達到了親熱合作的程度。</p>
<p>（四）開展民主參政監政運動由於政府的開明，各界民運團體的監政運動，民主精神，在晉西北的表現就特別活躍。各縣的村區經常地開着軍政民聯席會議。各地長民都派代表參加了這些會議。對于『好官好紳好人』的扶助，農民自然勞力着，同時對於『環官壤紳壤人』，却不客氣的來檢舉，或發動一個運動來打倒他們。譬如前嵐縣鐘縣長有舞弊的事情，於是農救會便同其他民運團體，發動了請願，鐘縣長便被撤換了。九一八紀念會上提出了某修路主任剝削勞苦民衆的工資，當局立即把這主任查辦了。其他如神池保德等地，都有這種打　壞官的運動，使各級行政機構的健全，行政效率的加强，都迅速的進步了不少。現在他們更進行着爭取村區長民選的運動。</p>
<p>其他如教育農民，提高他們的文化水準；舉辦訓練班，選拔與鍛鍊健全的幹部；努力加强除奸網；提倡小手工業，努力春耕秋收運動，加强生產；組織視察隊到各地視察，指導，推進各地的工作及農民完全的武裝計劃等，——都是農救會致力而有成效的。在抵禦×人，培植反攻力量，爭取最後勝利上，農救會可說已作了極大的貢獻。（民革社。喬力，談鋒。）</p>

<h3>德意必敗論</h3>
<p>— 楊璧譯</p>
<p>如果第二次歐洲大戰眞的會發生，民主陣線與軸心國家火併起來；我斷定，軸心國家是必敗的。</p>
<p>這幾年來，兩個法西斯魔王，希特勒與莫索里尼，運　在帷幄之中，决勝於千里之外，總是旗開得勝，馬到成功，聲勢煊嚇，不可一世，他　之所以能這樣、每次宋攻卽克，不戰卽勝，完全因爲他們始終把持着兩個不變的政策：</p>
<p>（一）盡一切的力量，去避免眞正戰爭的揭開；但却一味故意興風作浪，造成濃　的火藥氣味，威脅別人，讓人來移尊就教，奉送一切。</p>
<p>（二）如果不　戰爭眞的給玩出來，意大利與德國都給漩下了戰海；那麼，他們必須有盡一切恐怖與殘酷的技術，使這場戰爭速戰　決。</p>
<p>爲了應付這第二種政策的易於完成，意大利與德國現在是努力地在　藏食料，趕造工業原料和軍火，及積極重建軍隊。如果，他們這種準備，能够達極其充足的地步，比如說，在戰爭的初期，他們的財　力量能比民主國家的，强上四倍，那麼，他們是可以完成「速戰速决和速勝」的　望的。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>僑胞服務前綫運動</h3>
<p>華僑處身海外，隨時感到祖國的重大意義，民族意識最爲強烈，當此祖國存亡關頭，華僑保鄉衛國運動，尤具决定的意義。所以說目前支持××建國事業的緊急任務，首為全民族生動力量的動員，而尤以華橋力量的動員最爲迫急。僑胞服務前綫運動，是華橋支持×建×國事業的直接表現。</p>
<p>各地華僑服務前綫運動，在抗戰廿一個月以來，迭有偉大成就、現在馬來亞　隆坡華僑與南洋惠僑救鄉會共同組織的『東江華僑囘國服務團』兩隊，又於於昨由　洲抵港，日間卽將出發東江服務，越南華僑童軍戰地服務團第二批團員七十餘人，亦於日前分批抵港，日閒卽將轉赴粵北前綫服務。而廣州女向年會亦已特組××服務團，準備開赴前方工作，日內在本港徵求團員。我們對於僑胞此種熱烈服務前綫拯救祖國的工作，首先，對於卽將出發的服務團體，應當給與狂熱的歡送和　高的敬禮，我們應當擴大宣傳鼓勵海外僑界盡最大的力量予以支持。我們應當繼續更廣泛地發動人員，物品和經濟上的後援！其次，對於正在徵集與組織中的，我們應當於表不熱烈的歡迎和崇高的敬禮以外，應該盡一切力量加以帶助，從經濟上的以至精神食糧上的，各救亡團體，尤應在中央領導下，在中央國策範圍內，努力協助政府，進行宣傳，組織和訓練的工作，尤其是前綫服務人員，必須其備的政治認識，如對國際與中國情勢的知識，對於鞏固××統一戰綫和戰時民主政治的知識等。因爲我們不僅需要忠勇，我們更需要實際鬥爭的知識和能力，祗有這樣才能克服在服務前綫時所將遇到的那些意外的困難和危險，而完成我們神聖偉大的任務！</p>
<p>服務前綫需要崇高偉大的英雄主義的精神！但更需要耶穌釘十宇架的聖的犧牲精神！爲了砠國，爲了民族，爲了我們的故鄉，我們今日的受苦，是有偉大無比的收獲的！</p>

<h3>中華民族優秀的子孫　越南童軍服務團</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>第二批補充完畢抵港再度囘國服務　本報特寫</p>
<p>抗戰烽火爆發之後，安南華僑一羣年靑的童軍，馬上就投進砠國的懷抱，惠州就是他們活躍的地方。那時，記者亦在惠州工作，他們前前後後的經過，記者是知道得淸淸楚楚的。</p>
<p>他們這個團體的名稱，叫做安南華僑童軍戰地服務團，一行五六十人，有男有女，都是熱情活潑的青年，在廣州受第四路軍總部訓練後，就派到惠州服務，由當地防軍一五一師政治部領導其工作。</p>
<p>戲劇，演講，各種宣傳的方式都以苦榦，活躍的姿態出現。去年暑假中大服務團蒞惠　，他們攜手起來，舉行軍民聯歡會，深入士兵隊伍與鄉村民間展開慰問。座談，服務的艱辛工作，收效尤著。每當×機空襲的時候，他們就馬上出動，負起維持秩序與救護死傷的偉大任務。去年惠州失陷的前二天——十月十二日——他們在轟炸下搶救「酒布場」的死傷同胞，惠州失守的那一天（十四日）早晨，兩城馬該上，還有安南童軍的足跡。爲了他們的英勇，在荒亂的局熱之下，傷亡和失蹤的伙伴，一共就有九位。</p>
<p>死傷是搶救祖國危亡必需付與的代價，這般熱血奔騰的靑年知道得很淸楚，請准四路軍總部之後，他們整隊回越補充，第一批二個中隊，經於今年二月中旬急急又回到祖國來，現在在平山跟惠寶博的游擊隊幹政治工作；第二批的回國服務團又於日前抵港，這眞是太使人感奮的喜訊了。</p>
<p>今次抵港的第二批團員七十二人，是從報名中的二百人經過考試，檢驗體法，和受訓二月而來的精華。合正副團長共七十四人，當中有十二位是第一批嘗經在惠州工作過的舊同志。女團員一小隊共十人。在這七十二位團員中，有三分之一，是第一次回到砠國來的。他們來觀光偉大的祖國，來搶救危亡的祖國，又是一羣中華民族優秀的子孫，可愛極了。</p>
<p>昨天下午三時，十二集團軍高級參謀黃範一氏，假九龍彌敦酒店開會歡迎該團全體團員，首先由黃氏代表余漢謀將軍致歡迎詞，表示感佩靑年愛國的精神，并希望切實爲車民服務，配合着××××××聖任務。接着，該團團長林鷺英報告該團組織與服務的經過，說到安南救亡動態的時侯，尤其使人關　。</p>
<p>在安南的五個地域中，華僑佔有四十幾萬的一個大數目。在過去，由於當局的分化政策與我們僑胞因襲傳統的歷史遺毒，僑胞的團結力非常不够，力量渙散，自不待言。可是，抗戰之後，各帮的僑胞警覺到是應該一致對外的時候了，因此諒解，合作，爲了抗戰，而形成鞏固的統一陣線了。有錢的資本家掏出錢來，知識靑年流出汗來，奔走呼籲搶　祖國，從事宣傳，組織的種種活動，僑胞的認識爲愛國的熱忱，其進步眞是驚人。</p>
<p>從前，×貨在安南很述行，抗戰後，經我們的宣傳抵制，不僅我們僑胞不用×貨，就是　國人，安南土人，印度人，亦不用日貨了。我們的童軍與法國童軍聯絡在一起生活，對於國際宣傳，爭取國際同情，亦有很大的收效。最近，法國政府對僑胞的態度亦較前好得多，集會亦很自由，最使僑胞感奮的一個事實，就是西貢此次舉行防空演習的時候，法國政府請我們派一百個童子軍　忙維持秩序，這是破天荒的奇蹟，記者心裏想：抗戰勝利之後，僑胞抬頭的光榮，豈只這件小事而已。這件小事不過是華僑命運好轉的開始吧了。</p>
<p>他們擬於日間出發到總部聽候分派工作。那三分之一第一次囘國的，還要在受訓之後，才開始服務。</p>
<p>林團長帶隊到總部後，就要立刻回到安南訓練第三批囘國服務團。第三批的人數，現在預定二百人是有的一個大數目。</p>
<p>奴隸不是人做的，抗戰一定勝利的，愛國的僑胞，尤其是熱血的靑年學生，與技術人員，×××××××！，砠國正向我們微笑招呼呢！</p>

<h3>陳策將軍談　×擾南海絕難進展　天時地理均不利×之進攻　地方急謀救濟已籌妥辦法</h3>

<p>增援海南×軍、雖已增加到一萬六千人、但他佔據的地方不過是瓊山、海口、文昌、澄邁、定安幾個城市、他要深入內地、實在是萬分困難、沒有行遍瓊崖的人不知瓊崖之大、×人縱來兩倍兵力、也難達到控制整個海南的目的、瓊崖民衆、已經起來抗戰了、縱横的大山、瘴癘的氣候、都是不利於×人的進攻、只要我們的軍民能合作、民衆能够充分動員、五指山就轉變成×軍的坟墓、我軍子彈的缺乏、當然是一個問題、但已在設法接濟、其次關于救濟的問題、本人和宋子文先生以及僑商總會對這事已有切實計劃、辦法有積極消極兩種、消極的辦法、是與這裏的救濟機關如兒童保育會等、把從海南逃出的難民難童加以收容、對于困居海南的難民、我們也設法派人揣欵潜入海南、施以救濟、積極的辦法、就是難民移殖開墾、現正要求滇省府撥地作爲這個目的之用、因爲雲南與瓊崖、廣州灣、南洋交通較便、我們打算在滇選一個地方、供瓊島難民大規模移殖之用、宋子文先生已電雲龍主席、商量此事、目託農業專家葛建中先生赴滇代爲選定地域、至所需款項、廣東省府可撥多少、此外還有淮行向港僑和南洋瓊僑籌捐數十萬、事關桑梓、數目雖大，當不難籌集吧、</p>

<h3>電影與戲劇　蘇聯攝製兒童電影　絕對放棄明星制度　根據年齡編製本</h3>
<p>蘇聯電影在形式與內容上的前進，已爲世界所公認、最近蘇聯又以十二分的努力、注意到「兒童電影」、並且已經有了很好的表現、根據婦女與兒童的新五年計書、一九三八年的出品、兒童影片佔百分之二十五、僅蘇聯的兒童影片、不完全映給兒童看，並且完全是兒童所演成的、</p>
<p>然而、在蘇聯的好萊塢。正像成人影片蔑視明星制度一樣、兒童影片中也沒有兒童、不需要秀蘭鄧坡兒那樣去號召觀衆、蘇聯的兒童演在員完成了第一張片子後、便須脫離演員的生活、不得續演第二張、因爲蘇聯的當局不願意有個別的兒童得享盛名、大出風頭、</p>
<p>蘇聯的兒童演員、雖然不能够繼演第二片部子、他們在銀幕上的期間雖然很短促、可是做兒童演員的條件却十二分嚴格、不是隨隨便便的、大導演愛森斯坦爲了一個演員、曾經測騐過三千農村兒童、方才選到一個、</p>
<p>所謂兒童影片、原是一個總稱、兒童影片還按照着兒童的年齡、其各異其形式與內容、醫如說、給年齡最幼的兒童們所看的影片，往往是故事類、配以特殊的音樂、給八歲到十二歲兒童所看的影片、又往往是以無線電控制船艘的新發明等、給十二歲以上兒童所看的影片、則都有劇本的說明書、不但兒童電影的創製、要適合年齡不同的兒童們的需要、就是兒童電影院的構造、也要配合他們的條件、莫斯科現在已經有八家專供兒童看的電影院、所設的座椅、其髙度隨着年齡而不同、</p>
<p>在攝製兒童電影的過程中、最革命的一點是、沒有一個兒童演員知道鏡頭在什麼地方、換一句話說、他們在做戲的時候、却不知道自已是在做戲、這樣的表演、眞使一個天眞兒童的心理和個性的表現、一揮無餘了、當然要比秀蘭鄧波兒的裝腔作勢、逈然不同啦。</p>

<h3>活躍於銀幕上的歐戰英雄</h3>
<p>二十一年前的世界大戰中、有此戰場上的勇士們、今日却在好萊塢大顯神通、氣燄萬丈呢、</p>
<p>赫勃脫馬歇爾、柯爾門、李思廉霍華等、在廿年前、都是英國軍人呢、爲了祖國而出征、因負傷、才踏上了更生之途、改向舞台及銀幕上發展、</p>
<p>大戰前、李思廉霍華是銀行的辦事員、赫勃脫馬歇爾是會計師、那時他們想來一天到晚都在加減乘除而已、不要說是做電影演員、就是對於「電影」這個名詞、都有點生疏刺耳罷、馬歇爾的假木腿、就是彼時的成績</p>
<p>柯爾門在滑鐵盧一戰，爲了彈所傷、在醫院中還呻吟炸幾個月呢、這還算運氣、要不、恐怕影迷們就無福欣當他的藝術了、</p>
<p>馬上英雄喬治奧勃倫，當時是潜水艦的無線電生、我們可以猜想那是個多麽危險的生涯、十一月十一日這一天、休戰和約簽字、大家都狂歡雀躍、但遍找不着奧勃倫、但再仔細找、發現了他伏在無綫電報機上、兩肩抽聳着、是的、他啜泣了、</p>
<p>老將魯易斯東在大戰前、曾參加過西班牙的戰事、至今還持着美國陸軍少佐的美稱、</p>
<p>維克多麥克勞倫——好萊塢的粗綫條明星、在大戰時中受了兩三處輕傷、一時兄弟叫他做「幸運兒」、他曾一度爲英國步兵中尉、駐紥在美索不達米亞、差一點要給土人殺了、還有一次幾乎爲人壽殺、由此、立了大功、英王特別召見、用話勉勵他、嘉獎他、麥克常對人說、「和平紀念日——十一月十一日對於我、有兩種不同的感覺……」固然人人希望和平、但他希望多戰幾囘合、大顯身手呢、</p>
<p>……還有、許多別的人、成千成萬的人、一九一八年十一日這天、恐怕不能完全忘懷的、</p>
<p>阿道爾夫孟郁當時還是長官呢，穿着整潔的軍服、與他今日一樣的喜歡美觀、指揮着鐵中車作戰、他的重地站着、拿望遠鏡東張西望</p>
<p>哈鮑爲克斯（馬克斯三兄弟之一）、那時是紐約第七聯隊的星條新報的有名的戰地記者、他的真面目是一個靑年辯論家、那裏像銀幕上、燙捲的紅髮、裝模作樣的怪像呢？</p>
<p>約翰鮑爾斯是大戰時的隨軍記者羅倫楊最初是英國人、後來負傷、改入美國籍、還有冷面笑匠斐斯開登是好萊塢諸明星中第一個從軍人、他總是綳着臉不笑——勿論在銀幕內、或銀幕外——戰爭的殘酷的刺激、多少有點關係罷！</p>
<p>此外保嘉露伽西、武俠明星勃瓊克斯、賈克霍爾、茂文陶格斯等都是在世界大戰時、到過最前綫的勇士呢、勃克瓊斯在菲律濱某聯隊時、一隻脚還受過重傷、</p>
<p>還有、假如我們把參加過世界大戰的明星多寫幾個出名的、有李却亞倫、華爾德康諾尼、李奧曼、納爾遜埃第、史本塞屈養、勃魯斯蓋伯……等、</p>
<p>光陰眞快、廿一年的光陰、一刹那間就過去了、人事滄桑、瞬息萬變、當時、我們或他們——明星們誰能預料到廿一年後的今天呢、</p>

<h3>旭和杯第二戰　南華小挫陸軍聯　惠堂國威未上火線攻守力略减　陷於苦戰結果僅以二比一得勝</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】春光嫵媚、花鳥調情、這幾天、快活谷中馬蹄疾、也是球人得意時、</p>
<p>旭和坏二次大戰、昨天午後在海軍場揭開序幕、那兩枝兵馬、相當强勁、殺得緊張異常、座上髙朋、也看得神體魄、畢竟中華棋高一着、又唱凱旋歌、</p>
<p>結算總賬二比一、足見南華取勝、十分吃力、爲的是陸軍聯隊各員作戰火勇、力抗不懈、幸而比賽已改了七十分鐘制、不然的話、兵哥們能耐戰、會佔最後的便宜、</p>
<p>中華陣線、臨時微有變動、前軍主帥李惠寵、患河魚之疾、本上火線、代以陳德輝、李國威亦缺席、調劉茂把守左內衞、這麽一來、攻守方面都略受影響、</p>
<p>陸軍祗又氏臨陣退縮、由佳氏補充、</p>
<p>南華隊弄成先敗的局面、乃因劉茂累事、他動作慢鈍，蹴球力弱、座鎭要塞、無一是處、門前常生驚險、都是他防守不力所致、竊以爲、老劉已呈衰熊、不堪再用了、又所以力攻而不能多勝、係因德輝頻頻失機、他卽使有辦法衝開出路、但無辦法完成臨門最後一擊、故雖常佔優勢、亦僅獲小勝、假如有惠堂登場、當不致陷於苦戰、也不致僅獲二球之微、</p>
<p>「牽一髮而全身動」、用人問題、的是關係重要、倘若南華依照原陣應戰、端不會取勝那麼艱難、豈知更動的祗二人、而屢誤戎機的、結就在此二人的身上，可謂嚴榫之至、</p>
<p>然而、德輝衝利突擊的佳作、尙可抹煞、惟射門欠準而已、劉茂則成事不足、敗事有餘、毋怪見者共責、「人老珠黄不値錢」、老劉可以休矣、</p>
<p>依我看夾，此役南華似染上「半身不遂」症、左方面的幾位球人、如劉茂、謝錦洪、羅斗文、都表演失色、因而退守時、以左方爲可慮進攻時、亦以左方不可靠、遂演成一個畸形的戰局、不過、斗文雖未滿人意、然以前已略加多盤誤事之弊、</p>
<p>以昨戰形勢而論、南華時時有勝球的機會、亦時時有失球的危險、那機會的造成、有賴於馮景祥與黎兆榮到處鑽營及鄧廣森逢山開路、德州中央突破、而梁榮照與郭英祺從後供應、亦有功力、至於危險的發生、顯而易見的則爲劉茂與錦洪防衞無術、幸得李天生、榮照、英祺等協助觔園、及張榮才妙手回春、才得免於難、</p>
<p>陸軍前線進展迅速、南華腹地、時被踏破、且能避實乘虚、常利用右翼而來侵犯、惟諸鋒不擅射、幾次必勝之球、竟落野外、故南華能够保持勝利、亦算幸事、</p>
<p>中堅特殊、功夫頗有可取、不過初登大雅之堂、尙禾得鎭定從事、佳氏則沒法繹阻質森活動、技甚平庸、禮地士亦無者何時異的演出、故而整個前衛線，頗覺軟弱、常見南華諸鋒運用着妙美的短傳術、弄到他們捉摸不定、徒勞奔跑、</p>
<p>施漢與菲沙、臨時對調位置、正因爲這樣、絕不合拍、所以德輝的中央突破、時能一衝即入、祗可惜德輝多次射門不中、然亦因鄧勤表演特佳、屢挽狂瀾、遂不致多負、他與榮才可謂互相輝映、各有功於已隊、</p>
<p>南華旣勝此仗、便與海軍同分、希望愈加努力、莫致功虧一簣、本月廿二日與海軍决戰時、若得勝利、便重膺冠軍、至於陸軍已兩戰兩敗、已被擯出爭標範圍外了、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>兩陣對圓、戰端卽啟、說時遲、那時快、已見哥路滑策馬渡河、葛尼跟後衝入、劉茂出迎力拒、弄出鉄剷的把戲、不特無效、反而觸犯天條被罰十二碼球、由梳士主踢、一蹴人綱、榮才欲救無法徒喚奈何、</p>
<p>有頃、鄧廣森揭竿而起、德輝中路接應、立卽攻門、鄧勤側出撲救、幸免於難、然此時陸軍仍滿城風雨、但見鉄騎縱横、榮照截得來球、向前一送、德輝順脚即射、又被鄧勤撲出、于此酣戰中、兆榮單騎突至、一扣即入、勞勤閉門莫及、遂成一比一平局、</p>
<p>十六分鐘、達非路來犯、疾施冷箭應聲而入、惟裁判員明察秋毫、先判葛尼越位、乃如入寳山、空手而回、</p>
<p>兆榮突破防錢、把球遠交斗文、德輝同時渡河、及門而射、鄧勤勇救脫險、然德輝志在必得、再度扣關、鄧勤圍前撲一個空、看看沒救了、怎料施漢菲沙拚命殺全、又不得其門而入、直至景祥急行掃射、却中門楣、替鄧勤擋灾、</p>
<p>廿二分鐘、景祥起兵中原、德輝衝入陣地、施漢出來迎擊、德輝急行閃過、射一地球、鄧勤視線被阻、仆救無及、二比一南華反和爲勝了、</p>
<p>不久廣森迂週傳遞、切中恰好、德輝接着攻門、却被鄧勤拒出、兆榮伏兵突起、可惜射力不足、卒被救去、再戰移時、上半時吿終、二比一南華先勝、</p>
<p>下半時</p>

<h3>公開籃球賽　東方竟敗於南華　乙組首埸青隊勝記者　次埸警察敗於華雄會</h3>
<p>公開男子籃球賽、昨晚甲組東方對南華、前者羅致各地名手組成、大有脾睨一切之概、但本屆曾爲華南所敗、故東方勝之、較有可能、不料此場結果、又出冷門、南華以五三比四七獲勝、</p>
<p>數十分鐘之比賽過程、其緊凑處、爲開賽以來所少見、不獨幾度打成平手、而雙方勝負、有如鶻起鵲落、南華之勝、石振智厥功甚偉、時或百步穿楊、時或籃底推托、莫不馬到成功、而陳新球强攻暗襲二功亦不可沒、其餘諸子、均無忝厥職、鄭毓坤在最後七分、連射四球、無異奠下勝利之基業、全隊聯絡之佳妙亦其致勝原因、</p>
<p>南華採用反躍傳法、免避對方截奪、猶稱得法、因東方球員、均身材髙大、奪截佔盡便宜、故此法直使東方束手無策、同時更能配合時間和空間、故不論進攻退後、均獲理想之效果、至東方之敗、雖由馮念華無精彩之演出、但黄鼎芬屢先應勝之機、亦爲其致敗之因、孫寶慶、陳宗祺搶奪籃板彈球、雖見工夫、但前鋒僅靠羅吉安、稍有所獲、故上半場猶能佔先、下半場竟捨羅而用鍾國、攻勢更乏發動力、遂致反勝爲敗、</p>
<p>開課後、南華石振達得罰球之利、首開記錄、已而黄鼎芬還以顏色、混戰良久雙方先後以五此五及九比九相持不下、轉瞬又以十比十一及十四比十三互見勝負、及至十九比十九後、黄鼎芬籃底得機、兩罰兩射、造成廿九比廿一之最髙紀錄、至半場完結、仍以廿九比廿五先勝、</p>
<p>易地冉戰、南華石振智勇銳不可當、先以廿九比廿九迎頭趕上、再卅三比廿九反勝、迨至石振達四罰出場、易以鄭毓坤、南華攻勢反盛、陳新球、鄭毓坤先後逞威、東方馮念華亦不示弱。雙方以卅七比卅七打成平手、至四十九比四十時、東方猶作困獻之鬥、而南華得鄭毓坤在完場前數分鐘內、連中數球、結果卒以五十三比四十七將東方克服</p>
<p>末場華雄對警察、兩隊皆爲本屆乙組勁旅、均有奪冠軍之希望、故戰來頗形劇烈、上半場時華雄以十七比十三佔先、下半場警察竭力反攻、陳國屢射中的、嘗一度反敗爲勝、無何而華雄亦四面進迫、警察終無法應付、遂以二十五比三十七見敗、首場記者則以卅三比四十八受挫於靑隊、各場成績如下、</p>

<p>自由談蔣老么  羅烽　　—後方人物誌之一　　由軍慶到江申，寄居朋友的親戚家的時候，他們的房東蔣老么和我相識了。　　這位四川人，個不大，身腰扁寬，蒼白的糉子形的臉上，擁擠着凸出器官。冷眼看來，使人起一窒悶的感覺：但是，若單獨看他的眼睛，或是嘴的時候，又非常使人愉快。因爲那眼和嘴，都露呈着異常聰明，異常犀利的能性。　　「算是緣分，」他開始轉動着像是不可撲捉的黑眼球，尾音特別加重地說，「若不是日本鬼子，格雜種！你們下江人哪里會跑到我們上江來？」　　「可不是，若不是日本××，怎能看見從前幻想中的巫峡呢？」　　「但是，一些無知識人就曲解了你們、」他習慣地把腰彎着，用指尖醮一下下嘴唇，「格雜種，你猜他們怎末說呢？——他們說：「下江人都發了財，像蝗虫似的飛到四川喫橘柑來了，他們來享受，但我們却遭了災！」你看，這不是笑話嗎？——」　　「沒有辦法，」我默笑地繼續着說：「特爲飛到四川來吃橘柑也許是有的，但無論如何，儉樸的四川人，確實連帶受了影響。」　　「但是，你若是離開家，你們這樣個繁瑣的家務，恐怕沒有更適當的人來掌理了吧」？我替蔣老么担憂了。　　「家我不要啦！我早就决了心！」他把心字讀成又鏗鏘，又悠揚的去聲，僅僅這一個字，能使人慙愧，也使人奮起，「但是的，格雜種，我的老予死也不放鬆我，你看焦人不焦人」？　　「差不多這是很普遍的現象——前一代的人，總好阻礙我們這一代的事情；可是，要破除它並不難——」　　「是噯，」蔣老么擴張開眼睛，自信地說。「我們的辦法總比他們多得很哪。」　　這辦法雖然他一直不曾加以說明，但我始終憧憬着這位富有充分韌性的蔣老么，有實現他的辦法的一天。「生活程度驟然提高了，日常必需品，都漲到一倍至兩以上價錢，窮人怎得了呢？」　　「這個是噯，但是，單單報怨江下人，拋開日本××，格雜種，你看這點多末無知識呀！……不同情就算啦，還當嫉視下江人嗎？」　　蔣老么的話使我記起四川一般的商人釆，他們簡直是泯滅人性地欺騙和榨取外江人，於是我說：　　「最無情的要算商人了。他們一聽口音不對，就把物價提髙，並月擺出愛買不買的神氣……」　　「還有更兇的哪」他把腰一彎。搶着說，「譬如格雜種，一聽你口音，他就根本不理你。」　　蔣老么還沒有說完，白太太——朋友的親戚家的主婦——很急地喊我，我一揚手與蔣老么說聲；「再談吧』，匆忙走進了屋子。　　我懷疑問着站在門旁的白太太：　　「有事嗎？」　　「沒有事，」她笑者回答，「你跟他談什麽呢？你如不怕浪費唇舌，跟我們貓兒談談倒比較有趣呀……」　　這又是她的偏見，當我來時，她就吿訴我，地的房東——將老公是個極端狡猾，而又識欺不識敬的人物，這種斷語，是由於房子糾紛而得到的。　　據白太太自己說，最初租蔣老么房子時，原本講定是五間，等她們準備搬進來的那天，蔣老么忽然變卦，而且非常豪横地說：「要租袛有兩間，不然一間也沒有！」，因此互相爭論了一點鐘，蔣老么還是堅持原議。末了，她們掌來×機關的封條，要給他封大門了。蔣老么才軟化下來。而後來，蔣老么和她們却異常地表示好感。　　然而這一片話，並沒有加深我對於蔣老么的憎惡蔣因爲在不久以前，即使是現在，所謂勢力這法寶。依然能够戰敗手無寸鐵的弱者的　　在這以前，我只知道蔣老么是此地大房屋家蔣二爺的老兒子。但在第二次和蔣老么談話之後，我又知道他不但是個浪伍的軍官，而且是抗日軍人的家屬。　　「然而，不幸，」蔣老公嘆惜地說着，「二哥犧牲在淞滬之役，三哥在湖北黄梅殉職—他才二十八歲，比我大兩歲，格雜偅，這大年紀就死掉，實在令人痛心哪！」　　他說話時，痛苦地抽搐着鼻冀，眼窩裏埋藏着不勝憐惜的，亮晶晶的淚光，這一感動的場合，把我的拙笨的口才，激盪得越發拙笨，，我簡直不知怎樣編一句可能安慰他的辭句。　　「……難得的很，有這樣兩位爲民族而犠牲的哥哥…眞是光榮的……」　　我的話雖然平凡，却能揩去他的痛苦，他的眼角，嘴邊，立刻浮現出歡欣的條紋。黑眼球又在不可撲捉地轉動起來。　　「光榮嗎？——我覺得這是一大筆債——格邊種，蔣老么又習慣地彎起腰，並且伸出和臉同樣蒼白的小拳頭，在我的肚子前邊比擬進擊的姿勢，「這筆債我若不從日本××身上討回來，就沒有第二個人。」　　（未完）集體研究  黄繩　　理論落後於作品，研究落後於創作，在文藝戰線中，我們看出這一個缺憾。　　當前文藝的根本任務，是配台着整個政治和文化的運動，解决兩個迫切的問題：第一是抗戰建國的大衆政治宣傳，第二是文藝向更高階段的飛躍，這實在是一個非常沉重的担子，所以我們的文藝活動，要縝密化和組織化，要追求一個髙的效率。散兵綫的作戰，各行其是的作風。打了衝鋒沒有後援的冒險，都要加以嚴格的淸算，我們的淸算也已逐漸達成，文藝戰線是在擴大和發展的途中，排除前途的阻障，造出登高的階梯，是我們的要項；一個戰略的構造，一個戰術的策應，一個戰役的進行：是我們的急務，這理，我們便需要有計劃地有系統地來開始一個理論的運動，使需要有計劃地有系統地來開始一個研究的運動，理論落後於作品，研究落後於創作，這缺憾要快快的補救過來。　　周揚在文藝戰線發刊詞中指出，除了生活的實踐外，對於作家另一個重要的問題就是修養的問題，我們要承認我們大家的修養都是不够，要獲取表現這個偉大時代的充分的能力，我們有大大加緊用功的必要，他更指出，在文藝修養方面，我們的作家幾乎全是受西洋文學的黨陶一個落後的國家接受先進國家的文化的影響，是非常自然而且必要的；我們過去的錯失是因此而完全漠視了自己民族固有的文化。這提示是非常重要的。創作活動的加强，理論的建立和開展，是配台着的；而這兩者又都有賴於研究的加緊和深化，所以要開始一個理論的運動，「先進的」文化成果，民族固有的文化成果，都是我們研究的對象。　　單一强調生活鍛錬的重要，把研究作業認爲書生的玩意，好些文藝工作者都說不出這一個檢驗，然而我們同時很淸楚，生活的很忙迫和不安定，生活環境時變月遷，都要使一個工作者暫時放下研究的工作，一個工作者忙得連思，索的時間也不多有，我們如何要求他去作縝密的研究了，所以，一種集體研究的風氣，必須煽動和培養起來，讓最忙迫的工作者都能在集體「勞作」，集體討論中提供一部分力量，收穫一些可貴的研究成果和意見，事實上，我們研究的對象很廣闊，我們研究的任務很急迫，也唯有集體進行才有效率。　　香港的文藝工作者處在一個特別的環境裏，暫時不至有奔波轉徙之勞，也就最適宜負起一種最繁重的工作，——研究的工作，我們要有計劃地有系統地開始一個集體研究的運動。　　「文協」决定了分組研究的計劃，是非常重要的一着。我們渴望着每一組都能從速開展工作，我們要澈底淸除「隨便談談』的兒戲作風。要緊張，要精勤，要切實，要深入，這是研究工作者的鐵律。中華民族與葱菜牛肉  向天　　在四月四日的本欄裏讀了杜埃君「小鄰人」的一篇文字，裏面有叙說他的小鄰人在唱着義勇軍進行曲的時候將「中華民族」竟改做「葱菜牛肉」四個字，這一點無意的觀察，作者雖然沒有解釋，但却好視做今日一般孩童心理上對於中華民族所迫切的要求。　　合理的說法，一個政府對於該族所屬的男女老少各員的福利與幸福，都須負有保障之實的，政府不袛是外力來侵時候的保衛者，也該是能保育民族的葱菜牛肉與其他延持生命活力的養品。　　世人均知道當今嗜殺備戰的德意日諸國，他們所給與人民的並不是葱菜牛肉，更不是含着培養生命的食品，乃是生鐵製成的炸彈，槍，砲，坦克車，防毒面具和死亡。那不是日本的統治者天天向民衆宣傳着大陸政策，與生命線等等欺騙的名詞麽，但如今呢，大和民族已經被迫送上死亡綫了，無數人死亡，無數人變成了瘋狂，德國又怎能例外，全個日耳曼民族都是紮緊了腰身，强爲支持，但揮着鞭子的狂人希特勒，却吃得肥胖的大喊「東進！東進！」　　在這裏我們養慕蘇聯這個新而偉大的國家，他們不止扛鎗衛國的兵士有飽飯吃，並且婦女和孩童也都有充足的飯吃，單說他們的兒童學校就已經値得普世人的贊羡了。據梅眞君在本報的社會主義的國家一文中，就有以下的統計：　　「在一九三五至三六年」。　　一，初級學校有十二萬六千六百所，學生一千一百萬人。　　二，不完全中學三萬一千五百所，學生一千萬人。　　三，中學六千所，學生四百五十萬人　　四，此外還有七百多所工人講習院，內有學生二十五萬人。　　在一九三六至三七年，中小學學生又增至二千八百八十四萬二千人。」　　眞的今日世界最幸福的兒童，該屬於蘇聯兒童了。他們不止有「葱菜牛肉」，並且有設備週到的學校，和其他有趣的享受，有益的訓練，幸福的生活。　　中國的兒童呢？前幾天剛剛過的兒童節，大槪兒童們又該開始漸漸被遺棄了罷，若就今日中國的兒童的享受和待遇，去與蘇聯的兒童做比，當然失望的使是我們，不過我們有個確信，就是這次的中華民族亦能爲自己的兒童創造幸福之將的，不止使他們有够用的「葱菜牛肉」也能使他們在精神和文化生活上，變爲飽足滿意的幸福兒。世界上除了專以侵略殺掠的帝國主義者的國家不愛護兒童，迫使兒童供做炮灰之外，大槪沒有不愛護兒童的罷尤其是善體懷「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的中國愛和平愛亦子的民，更是保愛自己的子女罷！那麽從今日起，努力帮助抗戰，打倒漢奸，逐出強盜，如此才有保愛自己兒童的機會，才能使兒童有够用的「葱菜牛肉」的一天！反寬大論  鄭郁郎　　寬大是仁者的用心，「恩威並施」對於處事，施政，領軍上都是需要的，可是我們千萬不要忘記，寛大要受道義和事實的限制，倘若無條件地施用寬大，那末寬大便很容易流於「姑息」，造成「養虎為患」的惡果。　　對於不是絕對違反道義，事體較小和違犯者不過一時愚眛的事，我們不妨量情施以寬大，但是違反道義，事情足以令到國家淪亡，四萬萬人民變作奴隸，而違犯者却明知故犯，立心爲惡的，我們就萬不能寬大。　　對於某一個人相他底少數私黨寬大，而使四萬萬五千萬人損失生命，財產和自由，這不特是非仁者之用心，却是大不仁的一囘事。倘若寬大這樣用法，我們應當反對。　　對於出賣國家民族，立心爲惡的人們，我們政府應該嚴格處理，「法外施仁」對於他們是不能引用的。　　因爲無限制，無條件施用寬大而令我們悔恨的事件，在歷史上不知幾多，這裏也不必引出年代湮遠的史實就拿近事來說吧：辛亥革命成功以後，我們對於亡淸皇室太過寬大了，沒有加以適當的限制，更沒有像法國革命成功時，組織法庭處判法王路意十六以「禍國殃民之罪，把他送上斷頭台一囘事，結果便有張動復僻，和現在×人把溥儀小子出來組織「偽滿」的事。　　北伐成功，我們對於舊軍閥舊官僚太寬大了，沒有繩以國法，結果便有王克敏，梁鴻志，温宗堯，……羣奸出現，成立僞政府的事。　　「治凱世用重典」是一句歷史上，有見地的千眞萬確的名言，在抗戰建國的嚴重時期，我們對於出賣國家民族，危害民國的人必定要嚴格，袛有嚴格，萬不能寬大。滿洲的雪  舒羣　　他的眼裏，藏着淚水，把身體慢慢地移近她的身邊，給她慢慢地掩緊衣領，又給她整理一下被風吹散的髮絲；他願書一切的可能，給她以最後的安慰。她莫明地後退着，躱避着他——她怕他有損於自尊心和貞操的聖潔。突然，他握她的手的時候，在這一刹那間，他彷彿是說，誰不愛惜自己的靑春？誰不把自己的靑春之火，比如朝陽——鮮明的聖季。彷彿是說，這宇宙間，將有一奇異的離別，這離別是人生痛苦的記憶，別後，將是永遠的想念，別前，能不留戀？彷彿是說，彼此之閒，並無怨仇，但他不能用她的血而寫一個責任。一個工作的成功的記錄，雖然，在寫完以后，一是受難的，一是無辜的。彷彿是說，放人不易，殺人更難，殺人的手和被殺者的心，不將是同樣的顫抖嗎？　（卅三）文協留港會員通訊處編委會啓事　　文協周刊定于五月一日創刊，內容計分（一）文藝短論，（二）作品批評，（三）會員通訊，（四）文壇消息，（五）會務報告分別在（一）大公（二）珠江（三）申報（四）星島各副刊依次輪流附刊，請各會員踴躍寄稿，稿長勿超過一千二百字，稿寄香港郵箱七七一號。</p>

<h3>Collective Aggression and Collective Security</h3>
<p>Albania has once again been conquered by the iron fist of the Blackshirt dictator, isolated and without foreign aid. Albania fell in twenty-four hours, a truly lamentable event. But this event is not surprising; rather, it carries a profound lesson.</p>
<p>Our first understanding of this event is that Mussolini's invasion of Albania follows Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and the two are essentially the same type of action. After Hitler annexed Czechoslovakia, he drafted a "second invasion plan," detailing the colonies and interests Italy should reclaim, and repeatedly gave speeches encouraging Mussolini to rise up and seize them. Therefore, Mussolini's invasion of Albania and Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia can be seen as the same act of aggression by a gang of robbers.</p>
<p>The second understanding is that Mussolini's style is the same as Hitler's, adopting the method of "avoiding the strong and attacking the weak." Not long ago, Mussolini seemed poised to move north and threaten France's sphere of influence. At the time, some people worried that Mussolini's northward advance would lead to a direct conflict between Italy and France, igniting the European powder keg. But what was the result? He changed his northward advance to an eastward one, occupying all of Albania's territory with lightning speed, and "air-transported" 30,000 troops into Albania. Some units even entered Scutari, only five miles from the Yugoslav border, yesterday afternoon. This is the same step as Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Lithuania, threatening Romania. However, we must recognize that the aggression of world aggressors never stops at nibbling at weak countries. The reason they first choose weak countries is due to their own weakness, as they want to cultivate their own strength. Once they are fully feathered and strong, they will naturally take the next step and fight against the strong powers of Britain and France to gain control of Europe. Nibbling at weak countries is just preparation for fighting against powerful countries.</p>
<p>Countries currently under threat from European aggressors may face different timelines, but all large and small countries in Europe are already in grave danger. However, the methods of resisting aggressors have always been independent and isolated, resulting in them becoming victims under the oppression of powerful forces. There is no guarantee of mutual defense alliances between weak countries, and the guarantees of large countries to small countries are unreliable and lack sincerity. Therefore, weak countries are inevitably destined to be defeated one by one by aggressors. After her escape to Greece, the Queen of Albania made a statement, saying: "Albania, how can it resist this violent force? I hope that the unjust invasion of my weak country will prompt the British public to raise a voice of justice." The words are simple, but extremely poignant and worthy of contemplation. If Britain and France, who hold the reins of European politics, cannot sincerely and actively defend other weak and peaceful countries, then the number of weak countries in Europe will undoubtedly decrease again in the near future!</p>
<p>The British government authorities have recently been somewhat awakened by the aggressive iron fists of Hitler and Mussolini. They have agreed to guarantee Romania and Poland and have concluded a mutual assistance agreement with Poland. They are now in contact with Greece, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. However, we feel that Britain's previous guarantees to weak countries have often been empty and unfulfilled, and we still feel that Britain needs to take further steps. At the same time, weak countries must also take the initiative to discuss concrete ways for weak countries to help each other. The Soviet Union feels most deeply the necessity of collectively resisting aggressors, and the small countries of Eastern Europe should first consult with the Soviet Union to promote the realization of a collective security system.</p>
<p>Since the aggression of world robbers is performed through group action, then the resistance of the invaded countries must also be carried out through group action to be effective. Otherwise, if aggression is blocked in one area, aggression in another area will follow. The resistance of the invaded must be jointly launched by countries under the same threat and take uniform action. If, like Britain in the past, it was busy dealing with Italy when Mussolini threatened France from the north, and then only paid attention to Germany's aggression when Hitler launched the "Nazi Crusade" eastward, such separate and frantic efforts to block aggression only emboldened the world's aggressors. The only effective way today is for peace-loving countries to quickly rise up, regardless of East and West, without old suspicions, and unite to form a sound "collective security system" to resist group aggression with group action. The United States cannot be kept outside this collective security system, and the actions of Japanese aggressors in the Far East cannot be forgotten in resisting group aggression.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Xiangbo at One Hundred Years Old</h3>
<p>— Yu Youren</p>
<p>My teacher, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, was born in the 20th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (1840). Now, in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), he has reached the grand age of one hundred years. As a great scholar of his generation, he enjoys great blessings. His articles, morality, and contributions to the country and the nation in recent years are beyond what pen and ink can fully describe. However, I believe that the term "centennial youth" is sufficient to encompass and summarize him. My congratulatory words to Mr. Ma are: "An elder statesman of the nation, his spirit is always young." This kind of youthful spirit is the source of Mr. Ma's establishment, self-cultivation, and success. Therefore, it describes his entire personality. Let's compare Mr. Ma's life with the so-called elders and seniors of the world. There is a common concept of so-called elders and seniors, which is to retire after success and spend their years to the fullest. The Book of Documents says that the elderly should be diligent, referring to Shun getting tired of studying when he was old. The Book of Rites says that the elderly should rest and laboring farmers should be given a break, referring to elderly people being given leave and rest by officials. Zheng Xuan's Advice to His Son was written when he was only seventy years old, but he told him that the rituals and canons he studied every day must be passed down and told him to rest and retire because he was old. It can be seen that a person's spirit cannot be free from the control of his physiological organization. Once he reaches a certain age, his physiological functions decrease, and his spirit is also in a state of decline. However, Mr. Ma is not like that. Not only is his spirit strong beyond his youth even in his old age, but most of his great achievements were made after middle age, which is often referred to as the time of twilight years. Fudan University, which is now a major academic institution in the country, was founded by Mr. Ma and nurtured with his efforts. However, when Mr. Ma founded Fudan and its predecessor, Aurora College, he was almost seventy years old. When I studied at Aurora, the school building was borrowed from the former site of the Xujiahui Observatory, without its own building. The professors were all priests and monks from the Society of Jesus, without regular funding. Mr. Ma, with his white hair, supported it with his own efforts. It is unknown how many hardships and setbacks he went through. However, Mr. Ma was always diligent and happy, never tired of it. Later, when he founded Fudan, the simplicity of the school building and the difficulty of finding teachers were far inferior to Aurora. Mr. Ma, as an old man, called out to a dozen or so disciples to run around among gentry and officials. The hardships and setbacks he experienced were greater than when he founded Aurora. However, Mr. Ma was still diligent and happy, never tired of it. This spirit of diligence and tireless effort is what I call the spirit of youth and the driving force behind Mr. Ma's lifelong dedication to the country and the nation. Mr. Ma was born in a time of frequent foreign invasions, and his heart of loving the country, preserving the race, and restoring order was particularly strong in his old age and never changed. When Mr. Ma was sent to Gaochang, Japanese imperialism had already gradually revealed its fierce claws and was threatening to bully the superior country. Mr. Ma was worried about the times and foresaw the future. After he presented his plans to the central authorities without being listened to, he retired to teach in Shanghai, thinking of planting the foundation for national rejuvenation with a hundred-year plan for cultivating talents. This is the motive for the establishment of Aurora and Fudan Universities. When Aurora was established, many party members and patriots came to study. Mr. Ma not only imitated the European and American university education system to cultivate talents, hand-drafted the curriculum, and lectured himself, but also gathered the students together every Sunday to proclaim the great righteousness of the race and determine the heavy responsibility of resisting aggression. When Mr. Ma took the podium to preach, his beard bristled and his loyalty and indignation burst forth. When we recall it, we still cannot help but feel inspired. Who knew that Mr. Ma was already an old man of nearly seventy years old at this time? After the establishment of the Republic of China, many of Mr. Ma's disciples were able to serve the party and the country based on his teachings. At this time, Mr. Ma's heart was also slightly comforted. Since he went to Nanjing in the first year of the Republic of China to take charge of municipal administration, the Japanese saw that the sudden rise of our revolutionary forces would hinder the progress of their continental policy. Therefore, their conspiracy against us was also intensified. From the Twenty-One Demands to the Jinan Incident, their conspiracies and poisons were advancing step by step, almost every year. Mr. Ma traveled north and south, shaking the air with his thundering voice, working to awaken the people, not seeking a day's leisure due to his old age. When the September 18th Incident occurred, Mr. Ma was even more indignant. In Shanghai, he led the youth to unite with a common hatred for the enemy and put their hearts into sincere unity and a unified defense against insults. Later, he came to the capital by carriage to assist the central government and lay the foundation for the great plan of resisting the war and building the country. Mr. Ma entered Beijing in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China and was elected as a member of the National Government in January of the following year. He was already ninety-eight years old at that time. In the past, Fu Niansui was ninety years old and dictated the Book of Documents. Ma Yuan rode on his saddle to show that he was still useful. At that time, they were both recorded in historical records and praised as beautiful stories. Now, Mr. Ma's age has far exceeded that, and his heart is more heroic than ten thousand people. He is always standing on the front line of the people's struggle. In the future, when historical records are circulated, they may even regard it as a miracle. In fact, it is also due to what I call the spirit of youth. Therefore, I say that maintaining this spirit of youth is the source of Mr. Ma's lifelong success and is sufficient to describe his entire personality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Ma's rare old age and ability to maintain this spirit of youth to work hard for the country and the nation are deeply related to his religious beliefs. Although a person's spirit is controlled by material conditions, strong faith and firm adherence to morality can often turn weakness into strength and restore the courage of youth. Conversely, the passive thoughts of small vehicles can also make people's twilight years deeper and make them as weak as those who wither before autumn. Taoists are the ancestral sects of those who admire the art of longevity in this life. However, their way of nourishing life is to dull the hearing, block the vision, and keep the spirit still in order to protect their mysterious womb and feed their mother. Zhuang Zhou said that Lin Lei lived to be a hundred years old because he was not diligent in his youth and did not compete with the times when he grew up. If that is the case, then although the physical form is complete, the spirit has already died. How is it different from an earthen puppet? Mr. Ma is a pioneer in importing Western science. In addition to being proficient in ancient and modern languages, he has made deep achievements in the study of numbers, calendars, and phenomena, and his works have been widely circulated. However, he has received and practiced the Roman Orthodox Church since he was a child and has never slackened. Therefore, he can always use Jesus's positive view of life as an inexhaustible source of self-cultivation and dealing with the world. It is as if Mr. Ma was lecturing in the Aurora school, and Yan Fu from Houguan translated Spencer's medical book and published it to the world. Mr. Ma argued strongly with his disciples, almost forming two major fields in the academic world at the time. Is it because Mr. Ma was driving the times, sticking to his spirit, and liking to maintain the view of faction? It is also because Spencer is a philosopher of the British orthodox school, and his learning is close to materialism, with many rational obstacles. Furthermore, Yan Fu added the learning of Lao Zhuang to it, which is enough to hinder the courage of those who inherit learning and enter the city. This kind of positive and struggling religious belief is also the reason why Mr. Ma can maintain the spirit of youth and is what we admire Mr. Ma for and what those who take him as a model for self-cultivation must know.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I only cite the meaning of the spirit of youth to summarize Mr. Ma's life. It is difficult to fully describe Mr. Ma's good words and deeds. However, high mountains and great deeds are not far away. Now, at the time of mental mobilization to strive for victory in the War of Resistance, if we can follow Mr. Ma in this one meaning and dedicate ourselves to the country and the nation, so that Mr. Ma can see the rule of Zhongxing at the age of one hundred, then my article will be truly meaningful and will not be blamed by Mr. Ma for misinterpreting his teachings.</p>
<h3>Future Refugee Relief Work</h3>
<p>[Guilin Correspondence] Refugees, refugees who fled from the cannons of the Japanese fascists, who are unwilling to be obedient people, unwilling to be slaves, but willing to wander, and willing to fight together with compatriots who are resisting for the survival of the motherland and the liberation of the nation. Therefore, regardless of everything, they abandon their lovely hometown and wander inland. Although they did not go to the battlefield and did not directly participate in the war, they were able to resolutely abandon the fields and land passed down by their ancestors for generations and give the enemy a scorched earth. Such a spirit of sacrificing for the War of Resistance and enduring suffering for survival is worthy of our respect. At the same time, their wandering life should be given sympathy, comfort, and more help and relief.</p>
<p>Millions of refugees are scattered in our rear. Because our relief methods and strength, due to personnel systems and organizational structures, cannot be fully achieved as we hope, the displaced refugees suffer more pain. This is something we who are not refugees should feel infinitely sorry for. However, it cannot be denied that our government has done considerable work in providing relief. In the general impression of the refugees, based on their wandering experience, they feel that Guangxi is more responsible for providing relief to refugees.</p>
<p>Most of the refugees who came to Guilin were people from Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui who lost their homes the earliest. They arrived in Guilin via Nanchang, Changsha, and Hengyang. These refugees who stayed in Guilin did not have the courage to wander further because they had tasted too much of the hardship of walking two hundred miles with a heavy load. At the same time, they also felt the hopelessness of a long-term refugee life. Those in slightly better economic conditions run small businesses, and the small shops next to the Guilin Railway Station were established by them. Some pessimistically took the Xiang-Gui Railway and Zhejiang-Gui Railway back to Shanghai. Some even went to Shanghai to buy wedding clothes and got married in Guilin. Only those refugees who had become impoverished from fleeing still relied on the refugee shelters to live, with a daily living allowance of two jiao for adults and one jiao and five fen for children. However, men under the age of sixteen and over the age of sixty can receive three days' worth of living expenses when they first enter the shelter. In addition, they can only receive living expenses if they are sick. It is reasonable in the relief rules to have productive adults solve their livelihood through work.</p>
<p>Guangxi's ability to provide responsible refugee relief is related to the sound political foundation at the lower levels and the clean political style. From November to March 5 this year, there were 9,505 registered refugees in Guilin, and about 3,000 more were not registered for refugee management. The period with the most refugees was in November after the Changsha fire, with more than 4,000 refugees entering Guangxi. The Guangxi Refugee Relief Association built seven refugee camps outside Guilin to accommodate them. Lei, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, went to the refugee station early in the morning to distribute materials and send the refugees to the shelters. Many wandering refugees received warm comfort in the enthusiastic reception of an elderly official and realized the loveliness of the country. Initially, the refugees were divided into three types: three fen, one jiao, and one jiao and five fen per day. Due to the high prices in Guilin and the demands of the refugees, it has now been increased by five fen, with adults (the elderly, weak, and women) receiving two jiao per day and children receiving one jiao and five fen per day, with firewood, rice, oil, and salt to be allocated from this amount.</p>
<p>In Guilin, Mr. Feng Yuxiang, Mr. Fang Zhenwu, and the provincial government have established four reclamation areas in Liuzhou, Fengshan, and Hechi to provide relief to refugees through cultivation. The Liangfeng reclamation field accommodates refugees from Chaoxian and Fengyang counties in Anhui, the Dalu reclamation field accommodates refugees from Shandong, and the Fengshanhe reclamation area is specifically for accommodating refugees to reclaim land. However, few people have signed up because: (1) The refugees with labor are engaged in manual labor to temporarily maintain their livelihoods and expect to return home. (2) There are many middle-class people who cannot farm. (3) They are not accustomed to the climate, soil, and farming tools of Guangxi. At the same time, registration is done freely, without any political force to promote and encourage it.</p>
<p>The Guangxi government, out of sympathy for the refugees who have lost their homes, could not bear to force them to farm or work. Even if they were introduced to jobs, they were not necessarily forced to do them if the refugees felt they could not do them. To cater to the refugees who were unwilling to do hard labor, they requested special funds from the Central Relief Commission to issue to refugees to build houses on borrowed land along the streets of designated areas. Each household (five people per household) can receive thirty yuan (six yuan per person) for construction costs. They also provide small business loans to enable refugees to support themselves. This more proactive relief measure is noteworthy. More than a hundred new thatched huts have been built. Today they are temporary residences, but in the long run, their genealogies will have to add a branch in Guangxi, which will be an important source for the future history of population changes in the new China.</p>
<p>Refugees also have their own organizations: mutual aid societies and refugee cooperatives, funded by refugee shares of one hundred yuan each. The government allows them to open cooperatives in the shelters to provide refugees with daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables.</p>
<p>In the rear, governments in various places have used great efforts to provide relief. Even in the war zone, our unit commanders send political workers to receive them along the way. It can be said that they have come up with many ways to provide refugee relief. We hope that while providing relief, we can also organize, expand the meaning and scope of relief, and treat it as an important task in the cause of resisting the war and building the country. In a long-term war, our war zone will continue to expand, and the number of suffering compatriots will inevitably increase. The wars of the past twenty months cannot deny that the Japanese committed brutal rape, arson, and murder, which promoted our national awakening and strengthened the psychological indignation of our general public. Today, in addition to continuing their brutal policies, the Japanese are also adopting a hypocritical policy of benevolence to win over people's hearts and implement their political aggression. For example, the enemy who recently attacked Zhongxiang in central Hubei pretended to be innocent to the people, deceiving and numbing our compatriots, and striving to prevent the laboring masses who support the War of Resistance the most from fleeing, so that the enemy could establish a puppet regime and implement economic exploitation policies. On the one hand, we demand that the army can earnestly cooperate with the people and pay attention to military-civilian relations. On the other hand, we hope that refugee relief work will be combined with the political, military, economic, and educational aspects of the second phase of the War of Resistance to launch a frontal attack against the enemy's political offensive.</p>
<p>Our refugee relief work should replace the purely charitable concept of relief with proactive political and constructive relief.</p>
<p>In terms of the scope of relief, it should be divided into the rear and the front. The nature of the war is a total war, and the state of the war is an intertwined war. Refugee relief and accommodation do not allow us to accommodate and relieve refugees in the relatively safe rear. We should establish a war zone refugee relief committee in the occupied war zone to assist the war zone party and government committees in mobilizing and organizing the masses to help the military and civilians cooperate by providing refugee relief. We are responsible for escorting war zone refugees to shelters in the rear. In the rear, we should establish close links with local factories, farms, production departments, transportation agencies, trade unions, and schools to investigate the talents needed by various groups and organizations, and then introduce refugees who are suitable for these jobs separately. Various groups and organizations should have the obligation to give priority to employing refugees. For example, there are many refugees at the Guilin Railway Station who want to carry luggage and goods, but because they have not joined the coolie union, they can only get half a load from the organized local coolie groups, and sometimes they cannot carry them into the city. The station, for the convenience of passengers and the quick transportation of military supplies, needs many laborers. They want to organize the refugees, but they are afraid of conflicting with local organizations. Therefore, they request the military to send transportation soldiers to carry military supplies and luggage at the station. Refugees who want to make a living by labor express their feelings: "There is no powerful person among the villagers to speak for us." If the relief association has contact and cooperation with various groups and organizations, then these hard-working refugees can organize a "refugee labor work team" to rely on carrying goods at the station to maintain their livelihoods, and even the whole family can get enough to eat and wear. There are many such examples, so we hope that refugee relief work will actively stand on the introduction of work. At the same time, we should not refuse relief because they have not registered and do not have refugee tickets. As long as they are refugees who have lost their homes, even if they have some weaknesses, we can use political or organizational methods to adjust them and use the power of education to influence them. We should not say that we do not relieve the young and strong, just to cultivate their independence and calculate the relief purpose. We want to help the young and strong to solve their work properly so that a family can live on their own. This is true relief and true care for the strength of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>We hope that the work of refugee relief will not only become a purely charitable undertaking of the Central Committee, but should be regarded as an important task of the War of Resistance. The national salvation groups should also participate in the relief association to carry out propaganda, condolences, organization, and investigation among the refugee groups, to do political work, and to raise their awareness of the War of Resistance. The General Association of Industry and Commerce, banks, and cooperative banks should provide interest-free loans to strengthen the economic foundation of refugee reclamation fields, to accommodate a large number of refugees for reclamation, to stabilize their lives, to enable them to cultivate with peace of mind, to increase their production, and to develop the agricultural economy. At the same time, mobilize the property of various villager associations to relieve refugees, open factories and fields, arrange for the settlement of fellow villagers, and run schools and education institutes. It is best to be run by the local government in a unified manner. At this time, if we do not use the power of the guild halls to participate in the cause of building the country, then the significance of the existence of this kind of guild hall will be too small. The Jiangsu Guild Hall in Guilin has already been reorganized by Jiangsu representatives such as Yuan Ruoxian, requesting that the property be handed over to the management committee to provide relief to Jiangsu refugees. Although they have not yet made good achievements, their intentions are all practical. At the same time, the Guangxi authorities, for the sake of the education of refugee children, have launched various provincial guild halls in Guilin to jointly run a refugee children's school. Because many women are unwilling to send their children to educational institutions, and some have to let them sell pomelos and cigarettes on the streets for a living, a compromise measure is taken to have the villager associations run the schools to give refugee children the opportunity to be educated. However, we hope that it will be transformed from partial to overall unified education, just like kindergartens, all handed over to the state for education, and that the elderly, weak, and women who cannot work will be raised separately to reduce the burden on men.</p>
<p>In short, the new phase of the War of Resistance and national construction requires cooperation from all sides. We must use offensive politics to defeat the political aggression of the Japanese, win over the people, and isolate the Japanese. Refugee relief work must have planned, organized, unified, and responsible relief measures to provide refugees with life safety guarantees, wartime political education, and vocational training, so that the strength of every refugee can be contributed to the War of Resistance! This is a method of mobilizing manpower, and it is the most practical method of mobilization. (Qiujiang on March 24)</p>
<h3>Hengyang on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway: A Friend of China in China (4)</h3>
<p>— Ye Juesun</p>
<p>It was about eight o'clock, and they were still sleeping soundly. As for me on the upper berth, I had no choice but to force myself to sleep a little longer. In the end, Mrs. Li Meng got up early, and we followed suit. Gradually approaching Hunan, the climate became noticeably colder. The Hunan-Guangxi Railway is flanked by mountains. To the right, where it borders Hunan, is Du Tian, and to the left is Yuecheng Ridge. Beside the mountains are yellow earthen slopes, and along these earthen slopes, many thatched huts and sheds have been built. These are mostly the refugees from the Jiangzhe area who have fled here. The enemy destroyed their homes, so they had to seek new places to settle. Living along the railway line not only solved the housing problem, but also made it convenient to do some small business to solve the so-called "life." The Hunan-Guangxi Railway helped the wandering refugees, and the refugees also promoted the prosperity along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway.</p>
<p>The train crossed into the territory of Hunan Province and stopped at Lengshuitan in Lingling County. In the fields on both sides of the station, everyone was busy training new soldiers. Some had already put on military uniforms, while others were still wearing civilian clothes like ordinary people. Some were still learning basic unarmed movements, while others had practiced the aiming posture with guns. Many teams of different levels were doing different operations, but their spirit was equally vigorous. Their movements were equally agile. Every small station on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway was densely packed with new soldiers in training and the magnificent songs emanating from their mouths. Undoubtedly, they are the main force in the second phase of the War of Resistance. "China is indeed unbelievable," showing everywhere an inexhaustible potential for invincibility.</p>
<p>Farmers and farm women are diligently working in the paddy fields, and shepherds are riding on the backs of water buffaloes, singing happily. The train is rushing towards its distant journey. Nature always maintains its tranquility and silence. The three of us looked out the window together. Li Meng patted me on the back and said, "China is truly great." I said, "All this weaves together a new scenic line on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway." These two sentences seem a bit irrelevant and unconnected, but in the context and circumstances at the time, they were indeed enough to reflect what everyone wanted to say in their hearts.</p>
<p>The weather was particularly cold. We warmed ourselves in the lounge by jumping and fighting each other, anyway, there were no more passengers in the carriage. At a little after two o'clock in the afternoon, the train arrived in Hengyang.</p>
<p>Following the great fire of Changsha, Hengyang not only became a military stronghold on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, but also the commercial center and transportation hub of this area. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway can reach Changsha to the north and Shaoguan in Guangdong to the south. To the east, there is a highway leading from Jieyang via Quanxi and Chaling to Jiangxi Province and reaching Nanchang. To the west, there is the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, directly connecting to Guilin. Moreover, during the summer and autumn floods, Hengyang is also the terminus for small steamboats on the Xiang River. It is the rear and also the front line. The great fire of Changsha and the frequent bombings of Qujiang caused the former commercial essence of these two places to move to Hengyang. This is tantamount to putting a new wartime costume on the old Hengzhou Prefecture. The streets are crowded with pedestrians, and there are prosperous shops everywhere. Things that cannot be bought elsewhere can be bought here, and the prices are also very cheap. The reason is that goods from Hong Kong can be imported through Shantou, and Shantou has a highway to Shaoguan. As for going from Shaoguan to Hengyang, it is naturally very convenient. Whiskey, brandy, and all kinds of beer, coffee, and all canned foods, women's Three Flowers brand face powder, rouge, cosmetics... everything is available. Therefore, preventing the smuggling of Japanese goods and changing trademarks and counterfeiting has become one of the tasks of the local Anti-Japanese Support Association.</p>
<p>On the streets and in teahouses, we can see soldiers returning from the front lines with injuries everywhere. Yes, because of geographical and transportation reasons, Hengyang has become an important receptacle for wounded soldiers. Brothers from the Shaoguan, Changsha, and Nanchang lines are concentrated here. Then, Hengyang disperses them to western Hunan, Guangxi, and other places. Currently, there are still more than 20,000 wounded soldiers in Hengyang. Most of them were injured in the first phase of the war. Now, they have almost recovered and are just waiting for a new organization to join the team and return to the battlefield to kill the Japanese.</p>
<p>Hengyang is not only an important transit station for wounded soldiers, but also a necessary stop for troops being transported from various lines. Therefore, when we crossed the pontoon bridge over the Xiang River and ran to the vicinity of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway station on the opposite bank, we could see many slogans about military-civilian cooperation and welcoming the soldiers returning from the front lines. Moreover, first-aid stations for wounded soldiers are also set up everywhere. Most of these are run by the Anti-Japanese Support Association of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway employees. They have also organized many transportation teams and prepared canvas beds to specifically carry the brothers who come down from the train into the hospital. Indeed, the employees of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway have shown very glorious work achievements and service spirit during the War of Resistance. When Guangzhou was declared fallen in a panic, they organized eighteen rescue teams specifically responsible for destroying bridges to prevent the Japanese from advancing and rescuing the locomotives stationed at stations near Guangzhou. Therefore, although the fall of Guangzhou was unexpectedly rapid, the loss of locomotives and trains on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was minimal. This extraordinary achievement cannot be said to be a concrete manifestation of the heroic struggle of the railway workers.</p>
<p>The XX Division stationed in Hengyang came here after participating in the Battle of Wuhan. The middle and lower-level cadres in the troops are all graduates of the Central Military Academy and former subordinates of the 19th Route Army. They have either received rigorous military education or have sufficient combat experience. Therefore, although the XX Division has fought in Shanghai, southern Shandong, Shanxi, and Wuhan and other battlefields, it has inevitably suffered some losses. However, because of the strong cadres, new forces can be quickly replenished and grow. The reporter has visited their exercises. The brothers are all strong Shandong and Hunan people. Their movements are extremely skilled, their spirit is very invigorated, and their equipment is very complete. Opening up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is one of the dreams of the Japanese. Putting aside all the geographical difficulties, just relying on the well-prepared hundreds of thousands of brothers in various places along the way, who are extremely enthusiastic about killing the Japanese, can completely shatter the enemy's dream.</p>
<p>The New United business is also quite developed in Hengyang. There are the Dagang Daily and Zhengzhong Daily here, which are quite large in size (four pages) and the content is also very rich. They can be sold in the markets of Shaoguan and Changsha every other day. It is said that they can sell three or four thousand copies a day. At present, when newspapers are mostly limited to local areas, it cannot be said to be too bad to have a circulation of three or four thousand copies!</p>
<p>Japanese planes will never easily let go of any rear city. Hengyang has also been patronized by them once. Although the losses are not as great as those in Guilin, Guiyang, Shaoguan, and other places, it is necessary to take precautions and plan to disperse the commercial market to the surrounding countryside. This is indeed an important economic strategy in the long-term War of Resistance. The authorities should pay attention to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>San Jiao Cafe is the best Western restaurant in Hengyang. On the shelves of its bar, we can see colorful, different wine bottles and cans. Speaking of wine, there are at least ten kinds. Such a restaurant would never have been opened in Hengyang in peacetime, because at that time, wealthy people were mostly in Shanghai, Guangzhou... and other major cities. Looking at it from such trivial places, the War of Resistance has promoted the prosperity of the interior. Not only politics, but also the economy has begun to establish a new foundation and a new posture in the War of Resistance, transforming from urban trade heavily controlled by imperialist forces to independent national production in the interior. This is naturally a very gratifying phenomenon. Mr. Li Jingyi, the garrison commander of Hengyang, invited us to dinner in Qingli. Originally, this was just an ordinary expression of friendship, but judging from the content of the conversation, it seemed a bit like a coffee shop conversation before an international conference, with each party willing to exchange their respective situations. The conversation can be roughly divided into two parts. Li Meng first took the offensive and first asked Commander Li Jingyi about the movements of the Japanese army after Yuezhou and whether they would go down along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Li Jingyi's answer was roughly like this: The railway north of Changsha has been completely destroyed, and the highway from Changsha to Hankou has also been destroyed. Moreover, heavy troops are stationed on this line, such as Guan Linzheng and Wu Qihui, who are all good at fighting. In addition, south of Yuezhou, the terrain is high in the east and low in the west, so we can also use the mountains for defense. If the enemy really wants to attack Changsha from Yuezhou, they will definitely have to fight a hard battle, and they will inevitably suffer more losses and gain less. Therefore, in my personal opinion, the enemy's attempt will be to exit Dongting Lake and advance along the Yuan River to attack Changde. Because, first, the enemy has already captured Yuezhou at the mouth of Dongting Lake, which has somewhat reduced the military importance of Changsha, which is the same as how Nanchang became secondary after the enemy controlled Jiujiang at the mouth of Poyang Lake. Second, after capturing Changde, they can not only control western Hunan, but also directly threaten Guizhou and Sichuan, because the Sichuan-Hunan Highway and the Qian-Hunan Highway both reach Changde. Third, looking at the offensive route, advancing by both land and water is a tactic often used by the enemy. Moreover, the rivers around Changde and Taoyuan can still be accessed by small boats and rubber boats when the river is high. However, looking at the overall situation, the enemy is still undecided. The reason, of course, is that their strength is dispersed, making the attack more difficult. In addition, Mr. Li also talked about the international route problems in the southwest and northwest. Obviously, the enemy has no way to cut off these two transportation arteries to China. Then, this young general had an opportunity to launch a counter-offensive and asked Li Meng, why is France showing retreat and timidity everywhere regarding Japan's actions in the Far East?

<h3>Our Counter-Offensive Troops Press Towards Nanchang: Rapid Advance and Capture of Many Strongholds; Our Troops Confront the Japanese Army in Xinhui and Jiangmen, Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Changsha, this newspaper, 11th dispatch] Since the 9th, our Jiangxi troops have launched a counter-offensive against Nanchang on multiple fronts, advancing rapidly. By the 10th, they had reached the outskirts of Nanchang, recapturing many strongholds and annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. Fierce fighting is currently underway. The Japanese army is sending reinforcements to launch a counter-offensive towards Xian'an. Our troops are engaging them head-on. In Wuning, west of Xiushui and east of the river, our troops are in a stalemate with the Japanese army. There have been no changes. Near Ruichang and De'an, our guerrillas are active, launching surprise attacks on the Japanese army at any time, achieving considerable victories.</p>
<p>[Military Celebration, this newspaper, 10th dispatch] In northern Jiangxi, our counter-offensive troops have cut off the connection between Fengxin and Jing'an and continue to engage in bloody battles. The fighting southwest of Wuning is also fierce. East of the Gan River, the Japanese army is being blocked northwest of Jinxian and has made no progress.</p>
<p>[Guilin, this newspaper, 10th dispatch] The Japanese troops in southern Guangdong consist of a brigade brought from Hainan Island. They are currently engaged in combat with our troops near Xinhui and Jiangmen. On other battlefields, there have been only minor skirmishes.</p>
<p>[Zhangshu, Central News Agency, 10th] On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army sent 2,000 reinforcements, 4 tanks, and 4-5 artillery pieces towards Dacheng. Our troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the highway between Dacheng and Gao'an.</p>
<p>[Zhangshu, Central News Agency, 10th] The Japanese army in Dacheng continues to send reinforcements in an attempt to launch a counter-offensive. Our troops are currently holding high ground about ten li north of Gao'an City.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 10th] According to sources in the air defense sector, Japanese planes bombed Xi'an at 10:00 AM today and bombed Kunming again at 12:00 PM. Details have not yet been ascertained.</p>
<p>Ruicheng in western Shanxi Recaptured</p>
<p>[Chongqing, this newspaper, 10th dispatch] Yesterday, our troops in southwestern Shanxi recaptured Ruicheng and cleared out all the Japanese troops near Zhongtiao Mountain. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated in disarray to the area around Jiexian, Yuxiang, and Anyi.</p>
<p>[Xiangning, Minge News Agency, 10th] The Japanese army, under the command of Ben Shan, currently residing in Jiexiu, with approximately 5,000 men, launched an attack on Wanghe Town on the 2nd and 3rd on five fronts, mostly taking dangerous routes. A certain detachment of a certain column of our troops immediately fought bravely, launching three charges in melee combat. The fighting was extremely fierce. The Japanese army, with its wisdom exhausted and strength depleted, released tear gas. After our troops achieved considerable annihilation, they withdrew to advantageous areas to kill the Japanese army opportunistically. In this battle, 300-400 Japanese soldiers were killed. Our army suffered casualties of 4 cadres and 30-40 soldiers. On the 3rd, our reinforcements arrived at the predetermined location. To counter this Japanese attempt, they divided into two routes to attack Xiangdao and Huodi Huai, our army is closely guarding them. Wanghe Town has a Japanese force that will join up with the Japanese troops in Shuangxing Town, Anze, Fushan, and Heshun, and attempt to attack our southeastern Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, Associated Press, 10th] A Japanese spokesman recently admitted that the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in the recent battle of Nanchang. As of April 4, 305 soldiers were killed in action and 1,491 were wounded. He also stated that between February 10 and March 20, the Japanese army engaged in 343 battles with Chinese guerrillas in the Central China area. The Japanese side suffered 48 deaths and 76 injuries. Given the Japanese army's past practice of concealing the number of deaths and injuries, the above figures should be increased several times.</p>
<h3>Our Soldiers Defend to the Death: The Japanese General Offensive in Southern Shandong Fails; The Ratio of Our Troops' Deaths to Those of the Enemy is Three to Five; Blood and Flesh Write a Tragic Page in History</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, this newspaper, 10th dispatch] At the beginning of the month, the Japanese army in Shandong launched a general offensive on three fronts from Linqu to southern Shandong, intending to destroy our army. After we intercepted them in the Jianggu area and fought a bloody battle for three days and nights, our soldiers regarded death as their return home. Every stronghold was defended to the death, with no one retreating. Company Commander Wang Haichao, after the entire company was sacrificed, single-handedly killed more than a dozen Japanese soldiers before dying for his country. Deputy Company Commander Yang Dengfu, after being wounded, used a knife to砍kill several Japanese soldiers before dying. Platoon Leader Ma Wenyuan used a broadsword to砍kill nine Japanese soldiers, and he was also wounded in seven places. In addition, Company Commander Geng Jiqing, a Southern soldier class, intercepted the Japanese army that was detouring southwest of Jianggu, killed more than a hundred Japanese soldiers before being completely sacrificed. We sacrificed a total of 18 company and platoon leaders and more than 300 soldiers, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers, preventing them from advancing. This is a major victory in the occupied areas recently. The Japanese army has sent reinforcements to attack again, and fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<h3>A British Ship Detained in Fujian: British Warship Sails to Negotiate; More Than Ten Foreign Ships Detained in Wusong; British Consul in Shanghai Negotiates with the Japanese</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Foreign dispatch: The British-registered cargo ship "West Kists No. 1" sailed north from Hong Kong last week. It then picked up a large quantity of food in Zhangzhou, near Xiamen, and headed to Jianshan, Fuzhou. However, on Saturday last week, it was intercepted by a Japanese warship en route to Baja, part of the Penghu Islands. The British naval authorities learned of this and immediately telegraphed a British warship stationed in Shantou to sail to the location of the incident and negotiate with the Japanese. Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong Naval Headquarters made the following announcement: The De Klist Company's ship, West Kists, was taken to Baja by the Japanese, who demanded proof of the right to fly the British flag. The British warship Philis Ann immediately sailed from Shantou to negotiate, requesting its release and lodging a protest. It will then make a diplomatic ruling. According to Williamson &amp; Co., the ship's owner, the ship was registered with the British government by the De Klist Shipping Company two years ago. The shipowner is Molun. There are eighteen Chinese crew members.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong News] According to foreign dispatches from Hong Kong, the Japanese Navy detained eight Portuguese ships and three Greek ships off the coast of China during the last period. These eleven ships are now anchored in Wusong. The Portuguese Consul in Shanghai has begun negotiations. Among the detained ships are three ships from the Tang Wu Lun Shipping Company: Batu Lu, Zhao Ao, and Lu Yisi. These ships are all registered in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Bank Annual Meeting: Chairman Reports on the Situation in the Far East; British Commerce in China Damaged by the Japanese; China's Construction of the West Will Surely Succeed</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Jardine Matheson Bank (i.e., the Old Treasure Source Bank) recently held its annual meeting in London. Chairman Wells read out the business report for the past year, in which he mentioned the Far East, saying (the following is a translated excerpt from the original): The reason for the lackluster profits last year was not just one thing. The poor business conditions in various places cannot be denied, but the impact of the Sino-Japanese War was the main reason. In the past eighteen months, normal commerce has suffered extremely serious blows, which has affected the banking industry. The recent creation of counterfeit currencies in North China and the Japanese forcing merchants to trade with Japanese banks are ominous signs of infringement on normal commerce, and the impact on the bank's future in China is undeniable, especially in North China. A year ago, people at the annual meeting talked about the situation in the Far East, recognizing that the commercial and economic status of Britain in China would inevitably decline. This Sino-Japanese War has been prolonged, the scope has been expanded, and after eighteen months of intense struggle and economic turmoil, the recovery period is still far away. The provinces in central China have become desolate. The once prosperous countryside no longer has the appearance of ordinary years. The Yangtze River has lost its function as a major commercial artery. Commerce in Hankou and along the river cities has all come to a standstill. Guangzhou has also fallen into the hands of the Japanese. All of China's coast has been lost, and the Japanese are applying the old tricks of manipulating Manchuria to North China in an attempt to seize political and economic power. Although the bank's business scope extends to various places in the East, its activities in China account for the largest part. In this struggle between two major ethnic groups in the East, it is inappropriate for bankers to participate in it, but if we do not express our sympathy to the Chinese people, then we may seem unkind, because many of them are our friends, who are now in dire straits. Although China is currently in distress, it is engaged in a promising and beneficial undertaking for the world: the construction of the western provinces. Residents of the Yangtze River basin are moving there one after another, and the nation's talents are pooling their efforts to develop Tibet. Although it is not easy to allocate these immigrants to work, with the Chinese authorities' hard work and perseverance and the people's inherent endurance and hard work, the future harvest will surpass what has been lost in this war.</p>
<h3>Central National Government: Joint Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] The Central National Government held a joint Prime Minister's Memorial Week on the 10th. More than 300 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, the Chairman of the National Government, the heads of various ministries and commissions, and cadres of various agencies. Chairman Zhong Lin led the ceremony in accordance with the ritual. He Weiyingqin reported, titled "Promoting Our National Soul and the Three Principles of the People."</p>
<h3>Korean Volunteer Corps: Returning Home to Work</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 10th] According to Chinese sources, more than 60 members of the 2nd Regiment of the Korean Volunteer Army, who had been participating in the War of Resistance against Japan in Central China, have now been selected to return to Korea to intensify the revolutionary movement in Korea. It is said that these more than 60 men and women patriots are graduates of Chinese military and political training schools and are extremely rich in anti-Japanese revolutionary ideas. It is believed that the Korean revolutionary and anti-war movement can then be launched. Their departure from the Central China battlefield and return to Korea via North China was given a grand send-off.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Assassination Case: The Deceased is the President of the Puppet United Bank; A Swiss Engineer is Mistakenly Injured by a Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, Reuters, 10th] Chen Shuaishi, the president of the local puppet "Preparatory Bank," was assassinated last night while going to the cinema to watch a movie. At the same time, a Swiss engineer, Glancy, was also mistakenly killed. Because the murderer was a Mongolian named Maslov, he was captured. The murderer shot Luo, mistakenly killing the engineer. Luo was also seriously injured and has been admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<h3>Farmers' National Salvation Movement in Northwest Shanxi</h3>
<p>In a year of arduous struggle, a new anti-Japanese force has grown up. – Three hundred thousand people who were once slaves of feudalism and aggressors are now holding high the banner of resistance, living organized and combative lives. Around them, three million people are closely united as a reserve force. This is the outline of the farmers' national salvation movement on the anti-Japanese front in Northwest Shanxi today. In the anti-Japanese camp, it is an undeniable and vital force, the cornerstone of the anti-Japanese base in Northwest Shanxi, and the shield of Shanxi.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Northwest Shanxi is a vast area, including thirty-seven counties, bordering the Datong-Puzhou Railway in the east and extending beyond the Jinxi Highway in the south, along the Jiexiu-Shilou Highway. The bloody iron hooves of the × bandits once trampled this clean land, and most of it is still in the × area. Due to the ruggedness of the Lüliang Mountains within its borders, transportation is isolated, and the level of culture is exceptionally backward. However, the organization of the Farmers' National Salvation Association (abbreviated as the Farmers' National Salvation Association), which only emerged after the fall of Taiyuan, is now almost universally propagated in every village.</p>
<p>Northwest Shanxi can be said to be entirely an agricultural area, so the Farmers' National Salvation Association is the most powerful organization here. As long as one is engaged in agricultural labor, under the principles of "resisting Japan and saving the country, increasing farmers' knowledge, improving farmers' lives, and improving agricultural technology," one is eligible to join. Depending on age, gender, and personal interests, they can also be members of the Elderly Teams, Children's Corps, Youth National Salvation Association, and Women's National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>The Northwest Shanxi Thirty-Seven County Farmers' National Salvation Joint Association is the highest leading and unified organization. The organizational structure and work style at all levels mostly adopt a committee system and democratic centralism. Only one person from each village Farmers' National Salvation Association is removed from production, and other cadres are completely voluntary. They only collect one copper coin of membership fee from each member to cover all office expenses. Even the county Farmers' National Salvation Association workers only receive a meager living allowance of five cents for vegetables and one and a quarter pounds of millet noodles a day, but their enthusiasm for work is not relaxed at all.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>Due to different environments, the work achievements of the Farmers' National Salvation Associations in various counties over the past year and the work they are currently striving for do have some differences. However, the principles of their work are the same. In addition to the aims of the National Salvation Association, they also specifically put forward several points - regarding the stance and attitude that the Farmers' National Salvation Association should have, which are: obeying the political leadership of the government; assisting the government to smoothly realize the National Resistance and National Construction Program, the Ten Major Programs of the National Revolution, and other laws and decrees; with national interests above all else, the special interests of the farmers themselves must be striven for in the course of resistance; the Farmers' National Salvation Association has obtained legal status; and its independence must be maintained. The work of the Farmers' National Salvation Associations in various counties is summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Mobilizing Farmers to Take Up Arms</p>
<p>In Northwest Shanxi, there is still no conscription system. Each time new soldiers are mobilized, the number of recruits needed by the army at that time is allocated to each county, and then local administrative agencies and the army in need of replenishment jointly conduct the mobilization with various people's movement organizations. The Farmers' National Salvation Association has a close relationship with the people, so it works especially hard on this task, ensuring that every new soldier enlists voluntarily, and each mobilization is often completed before the scheduled date.</p>
<p>The establishment of the National Anti-× Self-Defense Corps (i.e., the village self-defense forces that did not leave production in the past) was enthusiastically assisted by every member of the Farmers' National Salvation Association. Within the corps, they played exemplary and leading roles. Guarding and checking pedestrians; establishing communications and transportation teams... a feather letter is delivered faster than the postal service; wounded soldiers are quickly transported from the front line to the rear hospitals; supplies from the rear are quickly transported to the battlefield: this is entirely reliant on the strength of the village self-defense corps.</p>
<p>(2) Improving Farmers' Livelihoods</p>
<p>Although reasonable burden has been implemented here for a long time, initially, some stubborn rich people, relying on their power, refused to contribute more money, turning the reasonable burden into an equal share per household; in some places, only a few wealthy people bore the burden, leading to the wealthy fleeing to the × area; or because the distribution of shares was unfair, causing many disputes. The Farmers' National Salvation Association corrected these undesirable phenomena. They, together with other people's movement organizations, assisted the local government to convene public meetings to assess the actual share to be allocated to each household, and passed it through every villager, gradually making this burden reasonable.</p>
<p>For the implementation of rent and interest reduction and the abolition of usury, the Farmers' National Salvation Association spared no effort to publicize to landlords and creditors; in addition, they raised funds to organize farmers' production and consumption cooperatives to eliminate the profiteering and manipulation of unscrupulous merchants; they requested the government to establish loan offices to lend food or cash to poor farmers on credit; other works such as setting up water conservancy committees, promoting small handicrafts, banning the slaughter of draught cattle, and reclamation have achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>The Farmers' National Salvation Association and other people's movement organizations have contributed greatly to giving preferential treatment to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. They launched the creation of plaques of "National Heroes" for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, lent or donated grain to poor families, generally designated the Mid-Autumn Festival as the Festival of Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Anti-Japanese Soldiers, and held tea parties to comfort the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. They organized cultivation teams, giving priority to plowing and harvesting for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, whether it was spring plowing or autumn harvest. Therefore, every soldier was relieved of family worries, and the mobilization of new soldiers was greatly helped.</p>
<p>(3) Military-Civilian Cooperation</p>
<p>The Farmers' National Salvation Association launched campaigns for the army to participate in spring plowing and autumn harvest, often held military-civilian get-together meetings, and regularly raised funds, grain, and sewed clothes and socks to comfort the fighting soldiers and the wounded on the front lines, naturally making the past strained relationship between the military and civilians reach a level of close cooperation.</p>
<p>(4) Developing Democratic Participation in Politics and Supervision of Politics</p>
<p>Due to the government's openness, the supervision movement and democratic spirit of people's movement organizations from all walks of life are particularly active in Northwest Shanxi. Military, political, and civilian joint meetings are often held in villages and districts of various counties. Representatives are sent by the local chiefs to participate in these meetings. Naturally, farmers work hard to support "good officials, good gentry, and good people," but they are not polite in reporting or launching a movement to overthrow "bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people." For example, when Zhong, the county magistrate of Qianlan County, had committed corruption, the Farmers' National Salvation Association, together with other people's movement organizations, launched a petition, and County Magistrate Zhong was replaced. At the 9/18 Memorial Meeting, it was pointed out that a road construction director exploited the wages of the hard-working people, and the authorities immediately investigated and dealt with the director. Other places such as Shenchi and Baode also had such movements to overthrow bad officials, which rapidly improved the soundness of administrative institutions at all levels and strengthened administrative efficiency. Now they are further carrying out the movement to fight for the election of village and district chiefs by the people.</p>
<p>Other works such as educating farmers to improve their cultural level; running training classes to select and train healthy cadres; striving to strengthen the elimination of traitors; promoting small handicrafts, striving for spring plowing and autumn harvest campaigns, strengthening production; organizing inspection teams to inspect, guide, and promote work in various places; and the complete armed plan for farmers - are all efforts that the Farmers' National Salvation Association has devoted itself to and achieved results. In resisting × people, cultivating counter-offensive forces, and striving for final victory, the Farmers' National Salvation Association can be said to have made great contributions. (Minge Society.

<h3>Proceedings of the Second Local Financial Conference</h3>
<h3>Statement by the Ministry of Finance Spokesperson</h3>
<p>(Continued from page three of this edition on April 6) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should, in accordance with the Regulations on Saving to Build the Country by Thrift, submit a special request to the Ministry of Finance for approval to handle national construction reserve funds. (Four) Provincial banks or local banks in the rear areas, if they need funds for circulation, should, in accordance with the Outline of Measures for Improving Local Financial Institutions, receive one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes, and shall not issue any banknotes. Those who have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue subsidiary currency shall not request additional issuance. (Five) Provinces in the rear areas should be self-sufficient. Provincial banks or local banks in each province should promote the average development of agricultural, industrial, and mining products related to military and civilian livelihoods by means of facilitating funds. For example, provinces that produce more grain but lack cotton should encourage cotton loans to increase cotton production and achieve self-sufficiency. (Six) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should pay attention to the spread of × person banknotes. (Seven) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should actively promote the business of acting as provincial, municipal, and county treasuries. (Eight) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should quickly train junior and middle-level students and staff members to prepare for enriching branches and offices.</p>
<p>(D) Regarding how to conveniently purchase goods, (1) For agricultural and industrial products that can be exported, the Trade Commission may entrust provincial banks or local banks to purchase them on its behalf. Native special products may be entrusted by the Agricultural Bureau to provincial banks or local banks to purchase them on its behalf, or provincial banks or local banks may purchase and transport them on their own. However, within the same region, the purchase of the same type of goods should be based on the principle of government agencies handling them. (2) For the convenience of liaison, the entrusting agency may send commissioners to be stationed permanently in the head offices of provincial banks or local banks in each province, or in the branches in important distribution markets. (3) The purchase methods can be divided into three types: (Zi) After the entrusting agency consults and agrees with the provincial bank or local bank, both parties sign a contract, and the provincial bank or local bank is responsible for purchasing on its behalf, and the profits and losses are borne by the provincial bank or local bank. (Chou) The entrusting agency entrusts the provincial bank to handle it on its behalf, the rise and fall of prices are negotiated by both parties at any time, and the entrusting agency gives commissions as appropriate. (Yin) The provincial bank or local bank collects it on its own and sells it to the Trade Commission and the Agricultural Capital Bureau, and the prices are negotiated at any time. (4) After accepting the entrustment, provincial banks and local banks should engage in procurement in the fastest possible way, and the required funds are paid in advance by the bank. After the goods are handed over to the entrusting agency, the entrusting agency will pay the payment in cash. If a provincial bank or local bank needs to pay for the issuance of small banknotes to prepare for issuance, it may consult with the entrusting agency to deposit the payable price with the central government as the funds for the bank's issuance of banknotes, so as to avoid transfers from each other. (5) The delivery location of the entrusted goods should be the largest distribution market in the province and the area with the most convenient transportation, which will be negotiated by both parties at any time. (6) The responsibility for the transportation and storage of the entrusted personnel shall be borne by the trustee before delivery, and by the trustee after delivery, but both parties shall assist each other. (7) In order to facilitate the purchase of products, provincial banks and local banks should report the production status, price fluctuations, and the increase or decrease of transportation tools of various products to the entrusting and purchasing agency at any time, so that both parties can handle it quickly. If in a war zone or close to a war zone, the military action should be reported to the entrusting agency as soon as possible. If the products are exported, the entrusting agency shall promptly notify the entrusted agency of the situation and price fluctuations of the products in the international market. [Unfinished]</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Writes an Article</h3>
<h3>Denouncing Wang Jingwei, Wanting to be □□ at the Expense of National Subjugation</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 10th] Wu Jingheng recently published an article. The original text is recorded below. I have not heard of Wang Jingwei's whereabouts for a long time. Since hearing the shocking news that Mr. Zeng Zhongming was brutally killed by patriotic overseas Chinese, a friend in Hong Kong sent me a poem and an article. The poem criticizes Wang's passivity, which is excessive. I have already followed his rhyme to explain it. The article was issued after Mr. Zeng's death, mostly fearing being covered in frost and dew one day, fearing eventually being named a traitor, not understanding his master's painstaking efforts to make peace, expressing his own position and speaking out for Mr. Zeng. Alas, Mr. Ren's situation is also very embarrassing. I only hope that from now on, Wang will only have the blunder of the reckless and unchecked telegram, and will never perform the act of selling out the country for personal gain. Then the gentleman's mistake will be like the eclipse of the sun and the moon, and everyone will see it. Wang's glorious history will not end up in the latrine, and it can also greatly comfort his friend Mr. Zeng in the underworld. However, as soon as Wang's article was published in the South China Morning Post, news from home and abroad emerged one after another, such as how Gao Zongwu and others were welcomed in Tokyo to secretly negotiate in Hanoi. I must now take another step and argue that this may all be due to the oversensitivity of journalists. However, it is almost as easy for important people to make remarks as it is for frivolous telegrams to cause trouble. Looking back on Wang's sudden departure to the south last winter, before the telegram was sent, I personally fell into a fog and was baffled. Wang Jingwei was a devout follower of the Prime Minister's original teachings, the Deputy President of the Party, and should share the same fate as the Party. He should not 폭× to plot wildly to bomb Chongqing. He escaped from battle and hid in a safe place. If you want me to expect that he might have different plans, how dare I use the belly of a villain to judge the heart of a gentleman? But simply saying that he was too tired and wanted a little rest seemed unlike him. So I thought that his wife, Chen Bijun, was a heroine among women and seemed even more intelligent. I sent a quick letter to Hanoi, the text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Wang's Wife</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Bijun,</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Jingwei has been in Chongqing, and I have seen him preside over dozens of meetings every week, and give dozens of speeches. This is exhausting. He receives officials and guests and has no rest day and night. I expected him to get sick, and now he is indeed ill. It is hoped that he will take a short rest while ill, and then take on arduous tasks again. However, the actions of important people can easily be used by × traitors to spread rumors. At this time, it is only the early stage of the War of Resistance. We should concentrate our main forces to defeat the enemy with weakness, wait for them to be consumed, and penetrate deep to eliminate them. This is the common belief of the country. That is, they favor "quick victory," and we favor "long-term resistance." This is the national policy that has been determined by 450 million people. ×× (unclear code) The night of leaving Beijing was scheduled ×××× (unclear) Mr. and Mr. Jingwei, together with all the participants in the highest meeting, advocated it. I suffered a great loss, and made him muddy-footed, thirsty to lure ××× (unclear) The entire army came again ×××××× (unclear) When he was exhausted and hoarse, Tai Chi Chuan was about to finish him off, but instead let him rest. How could there be a general order of Yue Wu's twelve gold medals that would make the world laugh and curse for all ages? Since ancient times, there has never been a country that has not perished, nor has there been a person who has not died. People have people, and countries have them. If people die because of betrayal, and countries perish because of temptation, they are both a disgrace to the nation. Mrs. , to assist Mr. Jingwei, to strike at Zai Nong in Beijing. For thirty years, Mrs. has been like a bright star, admired by the whole country. "Drawing a knife is a quick thing, not betraying the head of a young man." Everyone ×××× (unclear) Yan's face is more glorious than the head of a young man. Mr. Jingwei is ignorant of external affairs while ill. I hope Mrs. will quickly clear up this stain, so that the sky will always be bright. Mrs. must do it early. I am attached to my confidant, and dare to add a word, hoping that Mr. Jingwei will recover soon. Sincerely, Wu Jing, ——February 25), I don't know when this letter arrived in Hanoi, Wang had already sent a telegram to Hong Kong, and what is even more strange is that on the 26th Memorial Week, Chairman Jiang had already refuted in detail the fallacies published by Konoe on the 22nd. The whole world published it. How could Wang not know? Why did he announce the telegram on the 9th? In addition to wanting to speculate and explode ×, shake people's hearts, what other explanation is there? It is right that the whole country is angry and the whole party hates him. I am anxious for him, saying, Wang is asking for trouble for himself. Even on a small issue, the heroic deeds of Wen Shengcai, I am afraid that there are more people outside the country today. Indeed, Lin Baisheng was attacked in front, and Mr. Zeng Zhongming was killed behind. Unnecessary sacrifices are all caused by one word and one action. After the event, there is a remedy, and another example is cited. However, the more you say, the more confused you become. As the ancients said, a word once spoken cannot be retrieved by a team of four horses. Is that not true? Wang's mistake as a gentleman is like the eclipse of the sun and the moon, and everyone sees it. If he does not do anything to betray the country, everyone will admire him, leaving it to filial sons and grandsons to explain, saying that it was just unwise to say a word, and that his heart proves that there is nothing else.</p>
<p>Give an example</p>
<p>He gave an example, and I will give a further explanation.</p>
<p>(1) Wang is obsessed with advocating peace. It is not just that he disclosed the records of the National Defense Supreme Council. It is only that he leaked diplomatic and military secrets. There are clear punishments in the law, and he was the chairman of the meeting at the time, using his position to disclose secrets, and the punishment is even more severe. Wang also knows this deficiency himself. "For the sake of national interests, it is necessary to strictly keep secrets." Now, fortunately, he leaked the secrets, and his remarks are no different from accusing himself of his own crimes. The process of the German ambassador's mediation at the time and the diplomatic secrets, even now × people have not borrowed this to publicize, and even Ambassador Tao has not revealed anything outside. Wang then published his personal advocacy telegram, admitting that he could not be free in Chongqing, secretly left Chongqing, and was in a foreign land. Why didn't he secretly telegraph the central government to make a personal proposal, but first publish it in Hong Kong? Therefore, those who hate you are not happy to criticize your personal views. You can only abandon your leaking of national secrets, seeking the trust of × people, destroying the interests of the anti-Japanese war, and satisfying your personal desires for propaganda. At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, when the country's survival is at stake, the officers and soldiers at the front and the compatriots across the country are risking their lives to resist × and win the final victory. No matter who has any opinions, they should not offer them to the government, but immediately publicize them. This is what the national law and human sentiment do not allow. Moreover, you were the chairman at the time. Why is Wang obsessed with whether to make peace or not? He is twisting and fabricating facts, forgetting his crime of publicly anti-propaganda. I dare say that you have no other explanation except to speculate and surrender to ×, want to be a puppet and shake people's hearts, and want to achieve the goal of national subjugation.</p>
<p>(2) As for whether to make peace or not, Zhu is always observing mistakes. It is not in the secret diplomatic talks that he disclosed, but also in a passage of Chairman Jiang's keen observation, that is, "Chairman Jiang expressed to the German ambassador that he could not trust Japan, that Japan could tear up treaties and that words could not be counted." Also, the conditions that the German ambassador passed on from Japan at that time were already clear, and there was already "If a new government with power is established in North China in the future, it should be allowed to exist" and other knowing hind legs. If Chairman Jiang had not proposed two conditions in the past year and dealt with this proposal with a serious attitude, even if the German ambassador's kindness were realized, it would be no more than Chamberlain's Prime Minister's family, persuading him to cede the Sudetenland, and in less than half a year, he would be helpless and offer the whole country. Wang does not know what anesthetic wine he drank. On this "giving an example," he said that "the conditions of the Japanese side described by the German ambassador were not so clearly defined and were more demanding than this." Could it be that he was referring to not doubling the money, not ceding land, and canceling the concessions, etc.? Konoe deceived many ignorant villagers. Even if he did not read Chairman Jiang's detailed words, even primary school students would understand that the so-called economic cooperation is China's, and all the funds are his. The so-called "separation of the interior" means that the whole country has become a concession, and the land of China is also his land. Why do you need to pay you double the money? Why do you need to cede land? Why do you need to abolish concessions? Why are these "national subjugation conditions" understood by even primary school students? Wang insists on pretending not to understand, holding a red dog arrow and blowing it as a fire match. As long as I am asked to defend Wang, saying that the effect is not profit-seeking, who would believe my friend from Hong Kong, who told me that your admired heroine, Mrs. Wang, I am lucky to be born in her "comrade" and listen to her secret speech. She divides us. "We do not hesitate to start an internal turmoil, push him down, and if we make peace, let Mr. Wang come out to organize the 'Central Government' and the country will not perish." I am afraid that this kind of crazy couple singing and following each other is just a dream. Wang has also enumerated that when Konoe made a statement, Nanjing, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Anqing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou and Wuhan had all fallen, and Changsha had not yet fallen, and he had already burned it clean first. Peace talks cannot be carried out." [Unfinished]</p>
<h3>New Zealand Clergyman Killed in Guangdong</h3>
<h3>Bandits Fired Many Shots</h3>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Disregarded It</h3>
<p>[Reuter Guangzhou, 10th] Mr. Eaton, a New Zealand clergyman at Jiangcun Church, was shot by bandits last night. Three Chinese female nurses immediately acted bravely and transfused blood to save him, but because of the serious injuries, he was not saved. The bandits fired more than twenty shots. The Japanese sentry was only two hundred yards away from the church, but they turned a deaf ear. Mr. Eaton's body will be returned to Guangzhou for burial today. Mr. Eaton was quite famous in South China during his lifetime and was married last year during the Christmas season.</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Have New Intentions; Britain and France Insist on Resistance; Guaranteeing Greek Integrity and Establishing an Agreement with Turkey; Progress in the Anti-Aggression Alliance Movement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] Britain and France are still undecided on the issue of retaliation against Italy for its invasion of Albania. Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet specially abandoned their Easter holidays and rushed to Paris. Yesterday afternoon, a national defense meeting was held here, chaired by Premier Daladier. However, the details of the discussion are unknown. It is widely rumored that a batch of German troops are being transferred to the borders of Switzerland and the Netherlands. Therefore, France believes that Hitler is likely planning further actions. According to reliable sources, Britain and France have reached a concrete proposal to guarantee the integrity of Greek territory and have established a defense agreement with Turkey. British Ambassador Phipps notified Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday that British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Percy Loraine, will warn Italian Foreign Minister Ciano today not to take any action against Greece.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] According to authoritative sources, France is not satisfied with Italy's explanation for the occupation of Albania and feels that any attempt to invade Greece or Corfu would provoke an extremely serious international situation. It is said that Britain and France are in absolute cooperation. French Foreign Minister Bonnet has been in constant contact with the British and American ambassadors. Premier Daladier discussed the situation with British Ambassador Phipps and the Foreign Minister yesterday. At the same time, according to official sources, the French Cabinet will hold a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 10th] It is reported that three British battleships have arrived thirty-five miles north of Corfu from the Otranto Strait. It is widely rumored here that large British and French fleets are gathering in the Corfu port area of Greek territorial waters. The Greek government officially denies this. Important members of the Albanian royal family have arrived in Thessaly.</p>
<p>Tension on Downing Street</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 10th] Yesterday, Sunday, Downing Street was so busy during the Easter holiday, which was unprecedented for many years and can be described as a unique situation in history. At seven in the morning, the Prime Minister returned to London from Scotland and met with Halifax at noon, holding talks for 20 minutes. Before the Foreign Secretary met with Chamberlain, he met with Greek Ambassador Simopoulos at the Foreign Office. According to well-informed sources, the issue of Britain's guarantee of Greek security was raised for discussion. It is expected that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary will consider it in detail during their meeting. After Halifax returned to the Foreign Office from Downing Street, he continued to work without receiving guests. It is reported that Halifax had a long discussion with experts from the Foreign Office on the Mediterranean and the recent situation. In the afternoon, Halifax went to the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense and met with the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense, Gort, and the Deputy Commander of the Navy, Cunningham. The Secretary-General of the Foreign Office, Cadogan, accompanied him. The meeting at the Ministry of Defense lasted for an hour, but no announcement was made to the press after the meeting. It is also learned that an extraordinary meeting of the British Cabinet will be held on Monday morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] British political and senior military officials held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the current serious European situation. Some quarters here believe that Germany may launch a sudden attack without formally declaring war. Chamberlain has returned here from Scotland and spent the entire day yesterday studying reports from the Balkans and Germany, and constantly consulting with cabinet members. A special cabinet meeting will be convened today to discuss the Italian invasion of Albania and the defense of Greece. The British Foreign Secretary met with the Italian Chargé d'Affaires three times yesterday. The British Foreign Secretary asked him to take responsibility for quelling the rumors coming from the European continent and stated that Britain would never recognize Italy's annexation of Albania. It is reported that the Italian Chargé d'AffAffaires strongly told the British Foreign Secretary that Italy has no intention of using Albania as a base for aggression against other countries. Halifax also met with the Greek Minister. The "Sunday Dispatch" reported that the British Foreign Secretary has now received a report confirming the earlier prediction that the annexation of Albania by the Italian state is the first step in an attempt to invade the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Situation of British and Italian Diplomatic Talks</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] According to well-informed sources of this agency, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano flew back here by plane from Tirana at half past one yesterday and immediately met with British Ambassador Loraine for a long talk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] British Ambassador Lord Perth recently delivered a note from his government to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 10th] British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine visited Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday afternoon and asked the Foreign Minister to provide information on the situation in Albania. Ciano immediately explained everything in detail. The content of the meeting between the two is still unknown. Unofficial sources say that the government will not make any decisions until the general reaction in Britain and around the world is fully understood. Italian mouthpiece Guido Gayda wrote in the Italian Voice yesterday that if Britain wants to consider the Italian action as a violation of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, then let it be. Italy is determined to determine its future status step by step. From this, it can be seen that if Britain announces the abandonment of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, then Italy may immediately announce the annexation of Albania. Judging from the current situation, Italy seems to intend to declare Albania as its trusteeship.</p>
<p>France Convenes Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] Yesterday, Sunday night, the French Cabinet and the National Defense Conference were suddenly convened. The newspapers here had no news of it beforehand. According to political sources, the French government will announce that it will take the same step as Britain. Moreover, Italy's actions are a blow to France, so Britain will never give up. It is expected that Britain will also announce the abandonment of the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement or organize a Mediterranean military alliance.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] The cabinet meeting originally scheduled for Wednesday will be held at 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly will listen to the formal report from the cabinet on the international situation on Wednesday. According to the discussion in the "Journal des Débats," the Minister of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Foreign Affairs attended yesterday's Sunday National Defense Conference, but they remained silent. This shows that important military issues were definitely discussed at the meeting and are still under discussion. It was also learned this morning that the Chief of Staff of the French Colonial Army, Billotte, attended the National Defense Conference on Sunday and did not leave until 7 p.m. It is also generally expected that after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday afternoon, there may be news announced regarding the decisions of Sunday's National Defense Conference. It was found that French Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet met with British Ambassador Phipps on Sunday evening. According to political opinions, the British government may be forced to prepare for war because of Albania and Greece for some reason. Moreover, Italy's growing influence in the Balkan Peninsula has greatly affected British rights, especially in maintaining the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>The Balkan Countries are Shaken After Italy Occupies Albania; Rumors Say Italy May Have Further Actions; The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark are All Threatened</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bulgarian Capital, 10th] Diplomatic circles in the Balkan countries are deeply afraid that Italy may use its superior position after occupying Albania to quickly advance from Macedonia to Thessaloniki in Greece. It is rumored here that Bulgaria, as a result of German pressure, has agreed that once the military adventures of Italy and Germany further expand to the Balkan countries, Bulgaria will side with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Istanbul, 10th] It is reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels is scheduled to arrive here on the 12th. Before Goebbels returns home by plane, he may plan to visit Ankara, the capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Foreign newspapers have published reports that German troops are concentrated on the borders of the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. This has been denied here, saying that the only troop movements are the return of troops previously stationed in Moravia and Bohemia to their garrisons. The claim that Germany has made new demands to Poland has also been denied.</p>
<p>New Strategy of the Axis Powers</p>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 10th] It is generally believed here that after the invasion of Albania, Germany and Italy may have further actions. According to those close to the Axis powers, on Hitler's birthday on April 20th, Germany will propose a plan to place the entire Balkan Peninsula under a "joint economic system." According to sources in the Bulgarian capital, Bulgaria still aims to continue cooperating with other Balkan countries to maintain peace and still strongly supports the slogan "The Balkans for the Balkan people." Rumors in Bulgaria are very intense, causing great trouble to the government authorities. According to news from the Macedonian and Italian parties, Italy's second move will be to form an autonomous Macedonia, and all ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria will be under Italian protection.</p>
<p>Romania and Turkey Enhance Friendship</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Turkish Capital, 10th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu came here on the 7th to hold an emergency meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu. Gafencu hurriedly returned to the Romanian capital yesterday. According to a communique issued after the meeting between the two, Romania and Turkey have agreed to follow the policy of the Treaty of Friendship to enhance their dignity and ensure the permanent security and independence of the two countries. At the same time, both parties agreed to strengthen their ties with neighboring countries in accordance with the Salonica Pact of July 1938. The Salonica Pact, concluded between Bulgaria and the Balkan Entente countries, stipulates that all disputes between the contracting parties should be resolved amicably through negotiations and never resort to force.</p>
<p>The Attitude of Turkey and Bulgaria is Quite Speculative</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] This morning, newspapers here carried a report from Ankara, describing the negotiations between Turkey and Romania, and commenting on it, saying that this is the initial manifestation of the closer ties between the Western European democracies and the Little Entente countries. At the same time, doubts are raised about whether Turkey can adopt an anti-German policy. However, the "Petit Parisien" commented that Turkey does not have a significant position in the German market, so it may sympathize with the Western European powers, but the attitude of the Turkish government remains to be seen. The attitudes of Bulgaria are regarded as extremely important by various newspapers, because Britain's defense plan focuses on Eastern Europe. If Bulgaria continues to sympathize with Berlin and the Rome political axis, then the plan cannot be completed.</p>
<p>The Situation in Yugoslavia and the Netherlands is Very Dangerous</p>
<p>[Paris, 8th] Mussolini's forceful annexation of Albania is like inserting a sharp knife into the heart of the Balkans. The rulers of Central Europe believe that Hitler will follow Mussolini's example, swallowing and annexing, and that Yugoslavia is becoming Hitler's target is very likely. [Central News Agency, London, 10th] It is reported that the Italian Chargé d'Affaires provided assurances to Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, explaining that Italy has no intention of using Albania as a base for attacking other countries. The Foreign Secretary has a report proving that the claim that the German-Italian Axis's invasion of Albania is only intended to cover up their plan to attack the Netherlands is not entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>The Swedish Authorities Spoke Extravagantly of Neutrality</p>
<p>[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 9th] Swedish Defense Minister Sköld said in a speech today, "Now, taking a policy of cooperating with the powers outside of the Nordic countries involves too much risk, and the guarantees obtained are too unreliable." He continued, "Neutrality is our country's natural attitude." Sköld stressed that there is a need for calmness at this time, and declared that the chances of successfully defending against possible aggression are the same as the failure of taking risks. He finally reiterated the strengthening of Sweden's defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Peru Withdraws from the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] Peru has announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, but said it will continue to cooperate with the League's specialized technical organizations, such as the International Labor Organization. Peru is the tenth Latin American country to withdraw from the League of Nations in recent years.</p>
<h3>Rumors Say Eden Will Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] The term of office of British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, has expired, and he will return home within ten days. His vacancy has been internally decided to be succeeded by the Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. In addition, well-informed sources predict that former Foreign Secretary Eden will rejoin the cabinet in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] After Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London yesterday morning, government authorities immediately held consultations on the international situation. Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Greek Minister and then went to the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street and held talks with Chamberlain for half an hour. French Ambassador Corbin visited the Foreign Office at 1 p.m. yesterday. The Inner Cabinet will hold a meeting today.</p>
<h3>Important Statement from the Soviet Union: Not Inviting the Soviet Union to Participate in British-French Cooperation Will Inevitably Promote Continued Action by Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] Britain's guarantee of the independence of Greece and Turkey has now been completely decided and is only waiting for formal approval today. The British government is now fiercely resisting the hegemonic actions of Germany and Italy, and hopes that the Soviet Union, Greece, and Turkey will unite to encircle Germany in order to strengthen the British-Polish alliance signed last week and stop the adventurous and threatening actions of Hitler and Mussolini. A spokesman for the Soviet Union expressed the opinion that organizing an anti-aggression alliance without inviting the Soviet Union and Romania to participate is tantamount to giving Hitler a wide-open door to the Polish Corridor, allowing him to advance east to attack Soviet Ukraine and stop his activities in Western Europe. Therefore, Soviet people believe that not inviting the Soviet Union to join British-French cooperation will promote Hitler's continued action.</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Control All of Albania; Puppet Regime Established in Albania; Anti-Italian War Has Not Stopped</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tirana, 10th] The Italian side has established a "Provisional Administrative Committee" to temporarily manage national affairs, chaired by qualified Albanian officials. Although there are still small-scale battles against Italian troops occurring everywhere, the Italian army actually controls the entire Albanian country. Public order is gradually restored, and shops are opening for business. Many Albanian soldiers have surrendered their weapons to the Italian authorities here. If the weather is good, Mussolini is expected to fly to this question today. After arriving, he will announce Albania's status and Italy's policy toward the Balkan countries in the future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tirana, 10th] The provisional government of Albania has recently been formed, with seven cabinet members, led by Yebby, the former Prime Minister. Yebby is admired by the people of other countries and non-Italian foreigners. According to people close to the Italian government representatives, this government is neither subordinate to Italy nor protected by Italy, but a purely Albanian people's government, only not opposed to Italian "supervision."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] Prime Minister Mussolini intends to go to the capital of Albania tomorrow. If the weather is bad, it will be postponed. The authorities have instructed all radio stations to prepare to broadcast a special program at half past one tomorrow afternoon. At that time, the Prime Minister's speech may be broadcast, but it is not certain.</p>
<h3>Albanian King's Confidant Minister Gives a Painful Speech</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Skopje, Southern Yugoslavia, 10th] Before King Zog departed for Florina, his confidant minister told the Associated Press reporter, saying, "Many important towns in Albania are still being defended by the Albanian army. The war continues to progress. Although the Albanian army is being attacked, it can still maintain its position. There are two crazy people in Europe who are disrupting the whole world. These two people are Hitler and Mussolini. At the same time, there are two talents in Europe who are still sound asleep, namely Chamberlain and Daladier. If the British warships at Corfu had fired a shot, then we would not have had to flee."</p>
<h3>King of Albania's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Thessaloniki, 10th] King Zog, along with Queen Geraldine and Albanian government officials, took a train from Florina via Larissa to Athens.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 10th] It has been learned that King Zog and Queen Geraldine will soon leave Greece.</p>
<h3>Sending Commissioners to Albania; Expanding Propaganda Agencies</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 10th] It was officially announced here that after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome by plane from Tirana on Sunday noon, he went to the Palazzo Venezia in the afternoon to report to the Prime Minister. It was announced for the second time that when the Italian mechanized troops entered the Gazi Beister Road in Albania, the Albanian people expressed a "warm welcome." Also on Sunday, a number of senior officials from the Italian Ministry of Culture and Propaganda arrived in Tirana with the mission of reorganizing the telecommunications and newspaper agencies. The Albanian Ambassador to Bulgaria, D'Arao, sent a telegram to the Italian Prime Minister, thanking him for "saving" Albania and achieving freedom.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] Italian troops have occupied Korce, approaching the Greek border. Mussolini may postpone his trip to Albania in order to listen to the results of the British Cabinet meeting today and the French Cabinet meeting tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Inevitable Defeat of Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Bi</p>
<p>If a second European war really happens, and the democratic camp and the Axis countries clash; I am sure that the Axis countries will be defeated.</p>
<p>In recent years, two fascist demons, Hitler and Mussolini, have been planning in the tent, winning thousands of miles away, always winning every battle, succeeding at once, with a frightening momentum, invincible. The reason why they can do this, and win every attack, is entirely because they have always adhered to two unchanging policies:</p>
<p>(1) To do everything possible to avoid the outbreak of a real war; but deliberately create trouble, create a strong smell of gunpowder, threaten others, let people come to move their honor and teach, and offer everything.</p>
<p>(2) If the war really breaks out, and Italy and Germany are both caught in the sea of war; then, they must have all the terrible and cruel technologies to make this war a quick decision.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the easy completion of this second policy, Italy and Germany are now working hard to store food, rush to build industrial raw materials and munitions, and actively rebuild the army. If their preparation can reach an extremely sufficient point, for example, in the early stages of the war, their financial strength can be four times stronger than that of the democratic countries, then they can complete the hope of "quick battles, quick decisions, and quick victories."</p>
<p>In the eyes of the totalitarian countries, it is believed that like Britain and France today, they are proceeding step by step, slowly and methodically, in rebuilding industry and strengthening defense—just like in the first World War—slowly coping with everything, and they are bound to suffer an unprecedented blow.</p>
<h3>The Pope Explains Justice and Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Vatican City, 9th] Pope Pius XII, since taking office, recently held Easter Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, and afterwards broadcast a speech through wireless electricity, condemning various actions that violate treaties and break promises, and at the same time advocated respecting human dignity and freedom, and distributing various resources in a fair way. He said, if the nations cannot understand each other's treaties that they have solemnly accepted, if the promises provided are no longer valuable, then peace is hopeless, because this kind of treaties and promises are the foundation of mutual trust, once they lose their effectiveness, then the matter of reducing armaments, whether in material or in spirit, will be even more difficult to achieve. Without order, there can be no peace, and without justice, there can be no order. Justice is nothing more than obeying the laws of legitimate authorities, with the general welfare as the goal. Human freedom and dignity should be respected, and various sources of the world should be distributed in a fair way.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Extend the Neutrality Act; President Roosevelt Returns to Washington to Discuss How to Deal with the International Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently stated that the government intends to request Congress to enact a law in accordance with the original provisions of the "cash and carry" method of the law before the Neutrality Act expires on May 1. This is only a temporary measure before the issue of amending the Neutrality Act has been finally determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Congressman Bloom, acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, telegraphed famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh yesterday, requesting him to attend the meeting and express his views on the Neutrality Act. Senator George, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also invited Lindbergh to attend the meeting and express his views.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hot Springs, USA, 9th) President Roosevelt recently returned to Washington by special train. It is reported that President Roosevelt is extremely concerned about the imminent outbreak of international catastrophe and will hold consultations with the Secretary of State on the 10th. (Central News Agency, Washington, 10th) President Roosevelt and his wife are scheduled to return to the White House on time this morning to participate in the Easter celebrations.</p>
<p>Small Comment</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Service Frontline Movement</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese, living abroad, always feel the great significance of their motherland, and their national consciousness is the strongest. At this critical moment of the survival of the motherland, the overseas Chinese movement to protect their hometowns and defend their country is particularly decisive. Therefore, the current urgent task of supporting the nation-building cause is first and foremost the mobilization of the dynamic forces of the entire nation, and especially the mobilization of the overseas Chinese forces is the most urgent. The Overseas Chinese Service Frontline Movement is a direct manifestation of the overseas Chinese supporting the nation-building cause.</p>
<p>Since the 21 months of the war of resistance, the Overseas Chinese Service Frontline Movement in various places has achieved great achievements. Now, two teams of the "Overseas Chinese Return to China Service Corps" jointly organized by the Kuala Lumpur Overseas Chinese in Malaya and the Nanyang Huizhou Overseas Chinese Rescue Association arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Asia, and will depart for Dongjiang for service during the day. The second batch of more than 70 members of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese Scout Battlefield Service Corps also arrived in Hong Kong in batches a few days ago and will transfer to the front line in northern Guangdong during the day. The Guangzhou Women's Association has also specially organized a service corps, preparing to go to the front to work, and will be recruiting members in Hong Kong these days. For the enthusiastic work of overseas Chinese to serve the front line and save the motherland, first of all, we should give enthusiastic farewell and high salute to the service groups that are about to set off, and we should expand publicity to encourage overseas Chinese communities to support them with the greatest strength. We should continue to mobilize personnel, supplies, and economic support more widely! Secondly, for those that are being collected and organized, in addition to expressing warm welcome and lofty respect, we should do everything possible to help, from economic to spiritual food. Various salvation groups, especially under the leadership of the central government, should strive to assist the government within the scope of the central national policy, carry out the work of publicity, organization, and training, especially the frontline service personnel, must be equipped with political knowledge, such as knowledge of the international and Chinese situation, and knowledge of consolidating the united front and wartime democratic politics. Because we not only need loyalty and bravery, but we also need practical fighting knowledge and ability, only in this way can we overcome the unexpected difficulties and dangers encountered when serving on the front line, and complete our sacred and great mission!</p>
<p>Serving the front line requires a lofty and great spirit of heroism! But it requires even more of Jesus's sacred spirit of sacrifice on the cross! For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, for the sake of our homeland, our suffering today will have a great and unparalleled reward!</p>

<h3>Wu Jufang Requests the Women's Comfort Association to Receive Women and Children Refugees from War Zones; Fixed Number of One Thousand Needy Children to be Housed and Educated in Qujiang Training Group; Training for Families of War Participants and Refugee Women in Production Work</h3>
<p>The Guangdong New Movement Women's Work Committee and the United Relief Association, in view of the fact that needy children and refugee women from various war zones are displaced and unable to make a living, and if they are not promptly received and relieved, they will be in a desperate situation, have continuously launched special initiatives to organize the Guangdong Wartime Children's Training Group and the Guangdong New Life Women's Production Work Group in Qujiang County, to receive them. Ms. Wu Jufang (wife of Li Hanhun), chairman of the association, believes that the women and children refugees from Huiyang, Boluo, and other counties are fleeing from the ravages of the enemy army, struggling on the brink of starvation, and can only be saved if they are received in Hong Kong. Therefore, yesterday, she specially wrote to entrust the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association to receive them on their behalf.

<h3>Excellent Descendants of the Chinese Nation: The Vietnamese Scout Service Corps</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>The second batch of reinforcements has been completed and arrived in Hong Kong to return to the country to serve. Special report by this newspaper</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war of resistance, a group of young overseas Chinese scouts in Annam immediately threw themselves into the embrace of the motherland, and Huizhou was where they were active. At that time, this reporter was also working in Huizhou, and the reporter knew clearly about their past and present.</p>
<p>The name of their group is the Annam Overseas Chinese Scout Battlefield Service Corps, a group of fifty or sixty people, men and women, all enthusiastic and lively young people. After receiving training at the Fourth Route Army Headquarters in Guangzhou, they were sent to Huizhou to serve, and their work was led by the Political Department of the 151st Division of the local defense army.</p>
<p>They used drama, speeches, and various forms of publicity in a hardworking and active manner. Last summer vacation, the Zhongda Service Corps came to Huizhou, and they joined hands to hold a military-civilian get-together, and went deep into the ranks of soldiers and rural villages to carry out condolences. The arduous work of seminars and services was particularly effective. Whenever enemy planes bombed, they would immediately dispatch to take on the great task of maintaining order and rescuing the dead and wounded. Two days before the fall of Huizhou last year—October 12—they rescued the dead and wounded compatriots in "Jiubuchang" under the bombing. On the morning of the day Huizhou fell (the 14th), there were still footprints of Annam scouts on the Machang of the two cities. Because of their bravery, in the midst of the chaos, a total of nine partners were killed, injured, and missing.</p>
<p>Death and injury are the price that must be paid to rescue the motherland from danger. These passionate young people know it very well. After being approved by the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, they returned to Vietnam in formation to replenish their ranks. The first batch of two companies urgently returned to the motherland in mid-February this year and are now doing political work with the guerrillas of Pingshan, Huibao, and Boluo. The second batch of returning service corps arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago, which is really exciting news.</p>
<p>The 72 members of the second batch of corps who arrived in Hong Kong this time are the essence of the 200 people who signed up after undergoing examinations, physical examinations, and two months of training. Including the head and deputy head, there are a total of 74 people, including a small team of 10 female members. Among these 72 members, one-third are returning to the motherland for the first time. They have come to visit the great motherland and rescue the endangered motherland. They are another group of excellent descendants of the Chinese nation, extremely lovable.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, Huang Fanyi, a senior staff officer of the 12th Army Group, held a meeting at the Nathan Hotel in Kowloon to welcome all the members of the corps. First, Mr. Huang delivered a welcome speech on behalf of General Yu Hanmou, expressing his admiration for the patriotic spirit of the youth and hoping that they would earnestly serve the people and cooperate with the ×××××× sacred mission. Then, Lin Luying, the head of the corps, reported on the organization and service of the corps, and people were particularly concerned when he talked about the rescue activities in Annam.</p>
<p>In the five regions of Annam, overseas Chinese account for a large number of more than 400,000 people. In the past, due to the divisive policies of the authorities and the traditional historical poisons inherited by our compatriots, the unity of overseas Chinese was very insufficient and their strength was scattered, needless to say. However, after the war of resistance, overseas Chinese of all gangs realized that it was time to unite against foreign enemies. Therefore, they understood and cooperated for the sake of the war of resistance and formed a solid united front. Wealthy capitalists took out money, and intellectual youths shed sweat, running around calling for the rescue of the motherland, engaging in publicity and organizational activities. The progress of overseas Chinese's understanding of and enthusiasm for patriotism is truly amazing.</p>
<p>In the past, Japanese goods were very popular in Annam. After the war of resistance, through our publicity and boycott, not only did our overseas Chinese not use Japanese goods, but also the French, the Annamese, and the Indians also did not use Japanese goods. Our scouts are connected with French scouts in life, and have also achieved great results in international publicity and winning international sympathy. Recently, the French government's attitude towards overseas Chinese has also been much better than before, and gatherings are also very free. The most encouraging fact for overseas Chinese is that when Saigon held an air defense exercise this time, the French government asked us to send 100 Boy Scouts to help maintain order. This is an unprecedented miracle. The reporter thought to himself: After the victory of the war of resistance, the glory of overseas Chinese raising their heads will be more than just this small matter. This small matter is just the beginning of the improvement of the fate of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>They plan to set off during the day to headquarters to await assignment of work. The one-third who are returning to the country for the first time will have to undergo training before starting service.</p>
<p>After Leader Lin leads the team to headquarters, he will immediately return to Annam to train the third batch of returning service corps. The number of people in the third batch is now tentatively set at a large number of 200 people.</p>
<p>Slaves are not made by humans, the war of resistance will surely be victorious, patriotic overseas Chinese, especially the passionate young students and technical personnel, ×××××××!, the motherland is smiling and greeting us!</p>
<h3>Go Rescue the Motherland! The Guangzhou Women's Youth Association Organizes a Women's Return to Service Corps; Recruiting Comrades to Participate in Tomorrow's Test; The Singapore-East River Overseas Chinese Return to Service Corps has Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Youth Association of the Japanese, since the fall of Guangzhou, immediately moved its office to Hong Kong. The association is now in need of service personnel on the front line, and has specially organized a ×× service corps, recruiting passionate female compatriots to participate and go to the war zone to work.

The two teams, led by team leader Huang Zhiqiang, returned to the country from Singapore and arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago. They will return to China to serve in the near future. The Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm to welcome them. Many members of the two teams and guests from all walks of life attended. After the meeting, Chairman Chen Chengkuan delivered an opening speech, briefly saying that the two teams of the East River Overseas Chinese Service Corps have returned to the motherland from Southeast Asia this time to serve and build the country, which is of great significance. The trip of the two teams was assisted by the two gentlemen, overseas Chinese leaders Zhang Yucai and Huang Bocai, who provided all the expenses, which is especially appreciated by all. It is hoped that we will devote our money and efforts to the movement of saving our hometown and saving the country in the future, regardless of regional boundaries, so that we can achieve the goal of ×× victory. Then, Huang Boqun delivered a welcome speech, followed by Huang Bocai, Sun Shi, and others. After the speeches, the tea party ended happily.

<h3>Tour Guide Agencies are Thriving, Now Increased to More Than Seventy; Tangxi Geisha Also Organize Tour Guide Agencies</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, tour guide agencies have been discovered in Hong Kong. At first, there were only two or three agencies run by Shanghai people. However, as of recently, the establishment of such tour guide agencies has sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain, thriving. Statistics show that the number of existing tour guide agencies has increased from two or three to more than seventy. It is found that Cantonese women account for the majority of the tour guide girls in each agency, with only a small number being from other provinces. Each agency has a telephone to answer customers' calls. Their publicity is mainly based on newspaper advertisements, and publicity in hotels and restaurants is also very important. Judging from the current business situation of each agency, it is very impressive. Whether the government will crack down on each agency is still under consideration. In addition, in order to avoid special monthly consumption, Tangxi geisha are also planning to organize a tour guide agency with a scale, and they have now found a location and are ready to go. It can be realized during the day, etc.</p>
<h3>A Male Corpse Found on the Beach of Qingshan Eight Corners; The Corpse is Swollen and Suspected of Being Murdered</h3>
<p>A male corpse was found on the beach of Qingshan Eight Corners yesterday morning. The deceased was about thirty to thirty-five years old, wearing a white and blue striped shirt, gray cloth pants and shoes, and socks. The corpse was rotten and swollen, and the face was blurred and unrecognizable. The corpse had a rope tightly wrapped around it, with a large stone hanging below. Therefore, it is suspected that the deceased was murdered and the body was destroyed. The corpse was immersed in the water for many days, and it only floated to the surface of the sea off Qingshan yesterday morning. After being discovered by people nearby, they immediately went to the police station to report the case. The police sent police officers to investigate and carried the corpse for burial, etc.</p>
<h3>Maritime and Land Bandits are Rampant and Increasing; Three Robberies Occurred Yesterday Morning; Five Robbers Looted a Cargo Boat on the Sea off Qingyi Island; Six Armed Robbers Robbed a Farmer's House in Lema Chau</h3>
<p>Three robbery cases occurred in Hong Kong on land and sea within a few hours yesterday morning. The number of bandits reached more than ten, holding sharp guns and weapons, and their momentum was fierce. As a result, two cases were successful, and one case was fortunately discovered by the victim and did not suffer any losses, and one suspected bandit was captured and handed over to the police for investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingyi Island</p>
<p>Cargo boat No. 739, carrying about 500 dan of hemp stone, was moored in the northeast sea off Qingyi Island. The boat owner Liang Nian (52 years old), his wife Li Gui (42 years old), his son Liang Jinquan, his niece Liang Mei, and several partners were also sleeping on the boat, preparing to go to a certain place. At 0:30 yesterday morning, Liang and others were sleeping soundly when they were suddenly approached by a pirate boat. Five pirates, all holding guns and weapons, rushed onto the boat, pushing and threatening everyone. Liang Nian woke up in a dream and tried to resist, but was shot and injured by the robbers, and Liang Mei was also injured. The other members saw that the robbers were fierce and fierce, and lay dormant in a corner, daring not to act rashly. The robbers then tied everyone up and searched for about an hour, looting more than 100 yuan worth of gold jewelry, and then returned to the pirate boat and sailed towards Qingyi Island. After the incident, Liang and others sailed the boat back to Hong Kong to report the case and sent the two injured to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Lema Chau</p>
<p>Farmer Zhang Qili (39 years old) lives in a wooden house with an unnumbered license in Lema Chau Village, Sheung Shui. At 0:01 yesterday morning, he was forcibly robbed by six bandits. Three of the bandits were holding pistols and one was holding a ruler, threatening him and his family and forbidding them to make a sound. Then they dumped the boxes and searched for loot, and as a result, they robbed 50 Hong Kong dollars and a pearl-encrusted "bao tou" for women, with a total loss of 54 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Ma Tau Wai</p>
<p>Huang Jin (53 years old), a resident of the second floor of 53 Ma Tau Wai Road, Hung Hom, is the deputy manager of a nearby store. He went to the police station yesterday morning to report that at 3:45 yesterday morning, three strong men broke into his house to rob him. The bandits were all unarmed. He woke up in a dream and shouted "robbery". The robbers knew that the plan had been exposed and fled in embarrassment. Neighbors heard the sound and came out to help, and finally captured one suspected bandit and handed him over to the police for investigation. The other two bandits have disappeared. Fortunately, the discovery was made early, so no losses were suffered, etc.</p>
<h3>Prices of Vegetables Rise Due to Decreasing Supply; Vegetables Transported to Hong Kong from Macau Decrease</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in Jiangmen, direct traffic between Jiangmen and Macau has long been cut off, and the source of vegetables has also been cut off for a time. Fortunately, towns and villages in unbelligerent areas have successively transported them to Macau for sale and transport to Hong Kong in small boats. The supply of vegetables in Hong Kong continues to depend on this. However, the Tianyi Traffic Quanzhou and other ships that arrived in Hong Kong from Macau yesterday morning all reported that there were very few vegetables. According to the staff on the ship, because the vegetables transported to Macau from various towns and villages are sometimes available and sometimes not, and not many are transported, Macau also needs them very much. Because of this, the amount transported to Hong Kong in recent days has decreased. Due to the shortage of supply, the prices of various vegetables have risen this morning, which is one-third higher than during the pre-Jiangmen wartime, etc.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Hong Kong Emergency Regulations Act; Believes Police Authorities Can Conveniently Dispose of All Incoming Refugees Under Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>The promulgation of the Hong Kong Emergency Regulations was debated in the British House of Commons some time ago. Suran Sheng raised a question, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Stuart Jessel, replied. The detailed full text of the question and answer was sent to Hong Kong by airmail. The content is as follows: (Question) The Emergency Regulations currently in force in Hong Kong authorize the police authorities to arrest or deport vagrants. In order to avoid injustice, is there a court trial first? (Answer) These Emergency Regulations are very fair in order to cope with the current emergency environment in Hong Kong, and there is no risk of injustice. (Question) But do you know whether the reputation of the Hong Kong government will be affected if there is a little injustice when these regulations are implemented? (Answer) I think you have not fully understood the position of Hong Kong today. Due to the special environment, a large number of refugees are pouring into Hong Kong, so it is necessary to establish Emergency Regulations. (Question) For example, if the police mistakenly arrest good citizens, are there any regulations for counter-accusation? (Answer) This is a special regulation, so it allows the police authorities to dispose of all incoming refugees under special and difficult circumstances, etc.</p>
<h3>Accounts Federation Decides at Yesterday's Regular Meeting to Allocate Remaining Rice in Shenzhen to Refugees from Siyi; Number of Legal Attendance Units at the General Assembly Reduced to Eleven Organizations; Allocates Funds to Donate to Zhongda Northern Service Corps to Purchase Medicines</h3>

Attendees included Lu Fu (Chairman), Zhou Xingchi, Lin Peizhu, Ye Lanquan, Shan Dexin, and Su Anping. After the meeting and reports from various departments, Zhou Xingchi reported on the Siyi Chamber of Commerce's request to allocate rice to relieve the Siyi refugees fleeing to Macau. Next, the following were discussed: (1) The Siyi Chamber of Commerce's request to allocate the remaining rice and medicines in the Shenzhen Refugee Camp to the Siyi refugees. It was decided to allocate more than one hundred bags of rice and an appropriate amount of Chinese and Western medicines; (2) The Zhongda Northern Service Corps requested an allocation of medicines. It was decided to allocate HK$300 to purchase Western medicines; (3) In order to facilitate the holding of the General Assembly, whether to make slight changes to the charter and reduce the number of legal attendance units. It was decided that the meeting could be held with a reduction to eleven legal organizational units. The above three resolutions will still be submitted for discussion and approval at today's General Assembly before implementation.

It is reported that today's Joint General Assembly is scheduled to be held at 3:00 pm on the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>In addition, overseas Chinese compatriots from Shunde County in Hong Kong, Huang Dunhan, Hu Bohua, and Li Hongbin, deeply felt the importance of relief work due to the fall of their hometown. At the same time, the county's overseas Chinese organizations are usually very scattered, and they are very indifferent to relief and support. Since the fall of the whole county for more than a month, no relief has been heard. Therefore, they jointly sent a final mailing telegram with many overseas Chinese in the county to appeal to all walks of life and well-known merchants from the county in Hong Kong to seek relief for the refugees, and initiated the organization of the Shunde County Overseas Chinese Hong Kong Relief Association for their Hometowns. They convened a county overseas Chinese meeting and waited to submit it to the authorities for registration, and then actively prepared to proceed, etc.</p>

<h3>Our Counter-Offensive Military Enters New Phase Our Armies Converge on Guangzhou The Outer Defense Line of Cantonese * Has Been Breached By Us *Troops From East and West Rivers Are Transferred Back to Thicken Internal Defense The Northeast Line's Counter-Offensive is Fierce * Contacts Severed</h3>
<p>[Beijiang Express] The counter-offensive against the Cantonese * has broken through the * outer defense line after the armies from the east, west, and north successively captured important strongholds and gradually advanced south. On the eighth and ninth, our army continued to attack * and the encirclement of Guangzhou was gradually completed. The Cantonese * are plotting to defend the provincial capital to the death and have been successively reinforcing Cantonese * from all lines to northern Guangdong in recent days, rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs, attempting to fight our army to the death. Now our vanguard is gradually approaching Guangzhou, and the time to engage the main force of * is not far away. The war situation in recent days is recorded below.</p>
<p>Encirclement of Guangzhou Complete The Front Line Completed After our army launched a general counter-offensive on the morning of the sixth, the armies took Guangzhou as the target and adopted an encirclement formation to advance. In the past few days, we have won consecutive victories. In northern Guangdong, our army captured Shangxin Street, Shijiao, and crossed Jiangcun. The outer strongholds of the * northern route have been breached by our army. The troops attacking Sanshui on the north bank of the West River occupied Dalang Guanyao and continued to advance towards Ruixi and Yunshui, directly attacking Dalang and Shijing. On the eastern front, Fuhulu was also recovered on the seventh, sloping out of the Luobudong area along the Maofeng Mountain foothills along the Guangzeng Highway. At this point, the outer defense line of the Cantonese * troops in Cantonese * has been completely breached, approaching the suburbs. The * trapped in the city are forced to prepare for internal line operations. Currently, our armies are taking close contact and using steady tactics to complete the encirclement formation, in order to eliminate the stubborn * in one fell swoop. Therefore, the military counter-offensive against Cantonese * has entered a new phase.</p>
<p>* Armies From All Sides Rushed to Support The * who were transferred to attack Xinhe some time ago, shocked by the amazing progress of our counter-offensive army, the danger of Guangzhou, they hurriedly returned to support. On the sixth and seventh, * from Taiping, Shilong, Pingshan, Daliang, and Jiujiang moved to Guangzhou, gathering in northern Guangdong, numbering no less than 4,000 people. Continuing to check on the eighth and ninth, the * of the East and West Rivers continued to be transferred back to Guangzhou to thicken the internal defense line. According to front-line military information, as of the ninth, the * in and near Guangzhou has increased to about 10,000 people, mostly * the 18th Division and the 104th Division, together with the Kurume Tank Team, the puppet army Li Heyi Division, etc., distributed in Shijing, Xiaoping and other places, about 2,000 people. About 2,000 people are also stationed in Huangsha Railway Station, Xicun, Liuhua Bridge, and Sanyuanli. The rest of the Cantonese Han, Guanghua along the line and Baiyun Mountain foothills, Longyandong and other places are guarded by * soldiers. In recent days, the * military deployment in the suburbs has become more busy. Key points in the urban area, Chongkou, are also piled with sandbags and covered with barbed wire, etc., all in a state of tension.</p>
<p>Zeng Cong Hua * Dismembered By Us The * in Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian on the northeast front of Cantonese * have been isolated on all lines after our army's full-line counter-offensive. On the morning of the sixth, our army in Huaxian captured Yangcun, Shijiao Xu, cutting off the connection between Conghua * and Huaxian. On the seventh, the strike force of our 12th Army, led by Paitan, advanced south and captured Fuhulu, an important stronghold in northern Zengcheng, cutting off the communication line between Conghua Zengcheng and *. Therefore, the * at various strongholds on the front line have been dismantled by our army and attacked separately. In order to strive for contact, the * forces south of Conghua and north of Huaxian have constantly attacked us in the past few days. However, the * attacking Qian City, Weigan City, Aotou Xu, and Shidongwei on the seventh and eighth were bravely repulsed by us, suffering heavy casualties. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the Liang Division on the Conghua front has advanced near Shangang, fiercely pressing towards the * army. On the evening of the seventh, the strike force of the Liang Division ambushed Shangang along the Da Maoling Ridge, and a fierce battle broke out with *, retreating and advancing repeatedly, capturing a lot. It was not until dawn on the eighth that they withdrew to their original positions. Now, the * in Shangang Taipingchang has become the end of a strong crossbow, and it is not difficult for us to wipe them out completely.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Erupted in Zhucun Area Moreover, the left wing of the road continued to advance towards Shiqiao Zhucun on the Guangzeng Highway after capturing Fuhulu on the seventh. This area is the communication line between Guangzhou and Zengcheng * troops. Fearing that it would be cut off by us, the * troops led by Hasegawa and Tanaka stationed in Zengcheng moved to Shiqiao, Zhucun, Zhongxin, Beikeng Village and other places, attempting to stubbornly resist. Now, the main force of * is concentrated in the Zhucun area, with about 2,000 to 3,000 people. On the morning of the eighth, our army in Fuhuo arrived near the Guangzeng Highway, and joined the Huang Division, which attacked Zengcheng on the eastern route, and engaged in a fierce battle with * in Shetouling, Pingfengling, Shiqiao, Zhucun and other areas north of the Guangzeng Line. More than ten * aircraft flew to assist in the battle, taking turns to bomb our positions fiercely. The battle was still in progress until dusk.</p>
<h3>In Sanjiu District of Zhongshan * Offense Repulsed Da'ao Once Lost and Recaptured Huangpu * Attempted Landing Repulsed</h3>
<p>[Shiqi Express] Since our army reinforcements from Jiangmen and the army launched a major counter-offensive, * its head and tail were attacked, and Qiong was able to cope. On the morning of the ninth, at 6:00 AM, it sent six rubber boats and two shallow-water ships, fully loaded with more than 600 * soldiers, toward Da'ao in the San district of Zhongshan County, densely firing machine guns and small steel cannons at the shore. Our local team immediately rose up to meet the attack, fighting fiercely with * for about two hours. Finally, because the * firepower was too fierce, our team was forced to temporarily withdraw. * Soldiers swarmed ashore, rushing into Da'ao Xu, wantonly burning, killing, and looting, causing the entire Xu to burn, with fires starting everywhere, and the villagers crying and shaking the sky. After receiving the report from Yuan Dai, commander of the First District Guerrilla Task Force, he immediately dispatched a large number of guerrillas to reinforce, and instructed Qu Renzhe, the chief of staff of the department, to lead the team to take charge of the command, so that he must eliminate the * troops. After the troops of Commander Yuan arrived, they joined forces with the local team to launch a powerful counter-offensive. * finally couldn't support it, and was bravely repulsed by our team. When the * soldiers retreated, they were quickly rushed and killed by our team, so that they couldn't retreat in time, trampled on each other, and fell into the river to their deaths. The number was very large. Our army then recaptured Da'ao, and immediately comforted the refugees and handled the aftermath. It is estimated that Da'ao Xu suffered heavy losses in this battle, and the entire Xu was robbed. On the same day, when the * soldiers attacked Da'ao, they also sent out more than ten rubber boats and one shallow-water warship, followed to protect, and marched toward Da Huangpu in the Sanjiu district of Zhongshan along Guizhou Haiwei and Gulang, and used machine guns to shoot at the shore of Da Huangpu, attempting to land to contain our military strength. But our team was prepared, and when they saw * coming, they gave them a painful blow. * Knowing that the attack was unsuccessful, they fled in panic. Therefore, Da Huangpu was only harassed, and there was no violent war like what had happened. At the moment, our team's protection is extremely careful. If * dares to attack, they will be defeated. According to the latest news, at noon on the ninth, the * of Dongmaning attacked our position across the river. Our army calmly watched and did not return fire. Three * motorboats and one gunboat came from Yinggezui River and bombarded Xiaolan Town, but the bombs all fell into the wild, and our losses were very small. The population of Xiaolan has been completely evacuated, leaving only the young adults in the town, and the order is good. The waterway traffic with Shiqi is still unimpeded.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Li Shuzong Reports on the War of Resistance of the Panyu Team Zhuang Ding in Fallen Villages Vows Not to Be Willing to Be Obedient People</h3>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the villages of Panyu successively became fallen areas. Wherever * cavalry went, abandoned houses became ruins. The people were trampled, displaced, and extremely miserable. Many people in the fallen areas, because of family hatred and national disasters, gathered together, and they all hated * in the same way. So they rose up and vowed to resist *, and the momentum was very strong. After months of resistance, there was considerable warfare. However, the refugees in the county are in urgent need of rescue. Therefore, County Magistrate Li Shuzong of the county took the opportunity to pass through Hong Kong yesterday to consult with the overseas compatriots of the county. The Panyu Association in Hong Kong held a meeting at the Chonghao Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday to welcome him. Many local businessmen from the county, such as Feng Qi, attended. Feng Qi presided over the meeting and announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that County Magistrate Li has led the military and civilians in resisting the war for several months, and his fighting spirit is very admirable. Now, because the refugees in the county are in urgent need of relief, he has come to Hong Kong in person to consult with the fellow villagers in Hong Kong, hoping that all fellow villagers will think of the feelings of their hometown and generously donate, etc. Then, County Magistrate Li reported on the war of resistance of the guerrilla teams in the county and the real situation in the countryside trampled by * people in the past few months, which lasted for an hour. He said that the Panyu Resistance Team is mostly composed of people from the fallen areas, who are very motivated to resist the war because they feel that their families have been scattered and their people have died. As long as they have food to eat and guns and ammunition, they can fight with *. They have dedicated their lives to the country and to the war of resistance. Therefore, they are not afraid of death and * people. Whenever they have a chance, they will attack * people, or destroy * people's transportation and prevent * people from capturing. However, the situation of the people in the fallen areas under the trampling of * people is extremely miserable. I hope that overseas compatriots will provide economic assistance. Li also provided personal opinions on the issue of disaster relief, advocating the establishment of a Panyu Relief Committee in Hong Kong, (1) to passively relieve refugees in the fallen areas, (2) to actively relieve refugees from the fallen areas, so that they can produce. Everyone expressed great support, but because the Panyu Association has already established a disaster relief committee and mobilized all fundraising efforts, there is no need to reorganize. After County Magistrate Li finished speaking, Liu Bingnan, Li Bingsen, Feng Dingyi, Li Minran and others spoke one after another, and the meeting ended at 6:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Dongjiang Military Operations Unfolded Luofu Mountain Annihilated * Five Hundred * Fled to Zengcheng in Panic * Planes Bombed Longmen Madly</h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Express] Our army's counter-offensive military operations on the eastern route have been in contact with * who fled to Zeng in recent days, and the war situation is quite fierce. Our reporter made a special visit to various military agencies here, and the front-line military situation obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>Luofu * Troops Were Encircled and Annihilated After the Zengcheng * troops attacked our Luofu Mountain position on the seventh of the previous seven days. After being defeated by us, at dawn on the eighth, they sent more than 300 * cavalry, more than 1,000 infantry, four tanks, and four small steel cannons, using * planes to cover them, and launched another large-scale attack. At that time, our Luofu Mountain, * * * Liu Regiment, cooperated with the guerrilla team, and * * * Wei Detuan, lured * deep, and surrounded *. Unexpectedly, while being besieged, 11 * planes suddenly flew in from Longmen, dropping more than ten bombs, attempting to cover the * soldiers' retreat. In order to avoid the * planes' target, our regular army and guerrilla teams transferred to favorable positions and attacked * from the back and sides. * were caught off guard, and more than 500 people were killed or injured, and they fled back to the original road. However, the injured were numerous, so they cut down the lychee Ao Mountain pine trees and carried the injured back to Zengcheng. The situation was very embarrassing.</p>
<p>Wu Kangjian Captured * Army Officer After Wu Kangjian Regiment attacked Dayangwan and Fubu, * troops stayed in Taiping and did not dare to move lightly. Yesterday, on the eighth, more than 30 * troops were sent out to sneak into the villages under Changping to explore the reality of our points. Chi Zhongkuan and Zhai Rongji, the commander and deputy commander of the South Bank of the Dongjiang River, immediately sent * * * Battalion Zhang Weilie to bypass and surround *. More than ten * troops were killed on the spot, and one * sergeant was captured alive. On the same day, he was escorted back to Huiyang and hired an electric wheel to transfer to the headquarters of the He Yuan * * * Command.</p>
<p>* Planes Madly Bombed Near Longmen Also, at about 12:00 on the sixth, there were 16 * planes, divided into three batches, that madly bombed the villages near Longmen, dropping more than 20 bombs, most of which fell in the wilderness. We suffered no losses. Ten planes flew back to Guanyinge and Guzhu in Heyuan County for reconnaissance.</p>
<h3>Attrition War Successful Shilong My * Engaged in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express] Our army on the eastern route, together with Qi Wei's Ouyu and the security regiment of Luo Fengxiang, Yuan Huazhao, etc., captured Wancheng Shilong at 2:00 PM on the seventh, and immediately began to sweep the * troops in the vicinity of the two places. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 PM that evening, * troops sent 500 infantrymen from Taiping Shitan, carrying eight Xiaojie cannons, to reinforce and attack us fiercely. However, because of the dark twilight, they did not dare to enter the city. In order to achieve the purpose of consuming the * troops' strength, our army constantly shot at * troops. When * heard the sound of gunfire, they immediately fired their cannons and bombarded us. Once the * gunfire subsided, we used the old trick again. * Fearing the attack of our troops, they indiscriminately bombarded wildly and fought all night. At 5:00 AM on the eighth, our army had achieved the goal of the war of attrition, and separately transferred to Xiansha Village, Zhucun Village, Liaobu and other positions to defend. * Did not dare to pursue.</p>
<h3>Central New Artillery Opened Guangdong War</h3>
<p>[Beijiang Express] After the Commander of the Fourth War Zone in Guangdong ordered a full-scale general attack, there has been considerable progress on the east, west, and north roads. Unexpected strikes by Spear * have been reported in various ways. According to military news, Commander Zhang had telegraphed the Central Training Department to send a certain mechanized unit to the south to participate in the counter-offensive before the general attack order was issued, and to do everything possible to enhance the effectiveness of the battle and improve the chances of victory. Later, he asked the Central Military Commission to send newly trained artillery to the south to assist in the operation. After the Central Committee approved the deployment of a certain artillery unit to Guangdong, the unit arrived in a certain place in northern Guangdong on the fifth and sixth and prepared to enter the front lines of the east, west, and north routes. In the future, our counter-offensive forces will become more powerful, and the victory of sweeping away the * bandits can be expected.</p>
<h3>General Chen Ce Talks * Disturbs the South China Sea Extremely Difficult to Make Progress Favorable Weather and Geography Are Not Conducive to * Attacks Local Emergency Relief Already Prepared</h3>
<p>Our reporter was yesterday General Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, to issue the following military and political statement regarding Qiongya:</p>
<p>Although the * troops that reinforced Hainan have increased to 16,000 people, they only occupy a few cities in Qiongshan, Haikou, Wenchang, Chengmai, and Ding'an. It is really very difficult for them to go deep into the interior. People who have not traveled all over Qiongya do not know how big Qiongya is. Even if * come with twice as many troops, it will be difficult to control the entire Hainan. The people of Qiongya have already risen up to resist the war. The crisscrossing mountains and the miasmic climate are not conducive to * attacks. As long as our military and civilians can cooperate and the people can be fully mobilized, Wuzhi Mountain will become the graveyard of the * army. The lack of bullets for our army is certainly a problem, but we are trying to provide relief. Secondly, regarding the issue of relief, I and Mr. Song Ziwen, as well as the Overseas Chinese General Association, have a practical plan for this matter. There are two types of methods: active and passive. The passive method is to work with local relief agencies, such as the Children's Welfare Society, to take in refugees and orphans who have fled from Hainan. For refugees trapped in Hainan, we will also try to send people to sneak into Hainan and provide relief. The active method is to resettle refugees and cultivate wasteland. We are now asking the Yunnan Provincial Government to allocate land for this purpose, because the transportation between Yunnan and Qiongya, Guangzhou Bay, and Nanyang is more convenient. We plan to choose a place in Yunnan for the large-scale resettlement of refugees from Qiong Island. Mr. Song Ziwen has telegraphed Chairman Yunlong to discuss this matter, and has entrusted agricultural expert Mr. Ge Jianzhong to go to Yunnan to select a region on our behalf. As for the funds needed, the Guangdong Provincial Government can allocate a certain amount, and in addition, the Huai Bank will raise tens of thousands of dollars from Hong Kong and Nanyang Qionghai overseas Chinese. This matter concerns our hometown, and although the amount is large, it should not be difficult to raise.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Jardine Shipping Company's Maosheng will arrive in Hong Kong from Sandakan on the 15th of this month, and is expected to arrive around the 20th of this month. In addition, the British ship Hulujia, leased by the company, will begin to replace Xiansheng in traveling between Sandakan and Hong Kong today. The ship is also scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at 5:00 PM today.</p>

<h3>Film and Drama Soviet-Made Children's Films Absolutely Abandon the Star System Make Books Based on Age</h3>
<p>The progress of Soviet films in form and content has been recognized by the world. Recently, the Soviet Union has also paid attention to "children's films" with great effort and has already made good progress. According to the new five-year plan for women and children, children's films accounted for 25% of the output in 1938. Only Soviet children's films are not completely shown to children, and are completely performed by children.</p>
<p>However, in the Soviet Union's Hollywood, just like adult films despise the star system, there are no children in children's films, and there is no need for Shirley Temple to call on the audience. Soviet child actors must leave the life of an actor after completing the first film and are not allowed to continue acting in the second film, because the Soviet authorities do not want individual children to enjoy fame and become famous.</p>
<p>Although Soviet child actors are not able to continue acting in the second film, and their time on the screen is very short, the conditions for being a child actor are very strict, and it is not casual. The great director Eisenstein once tested 3,000 rural children for an actor before he found one.</p>
<p>The so-called children's film is a general term. Children's films are also based on the age of the children, and their forms and contents are different. Medical science says that films for the youngest children are often story-based, with special music. Films for children aged eight to twelve are often new inventions such as radio-controlled ships. Films for children over twelve years old have script explanations. Not only should the creation of children's films meet the needs of children of different ages, but also the structure of children's cinemas should also meet their conditions. Moscow now has eight cinemas dedicated to children, and the height of the seats varies with age.</p>
<p>The most revolutionary thing in the process of making children's films is that no child actor knows where the camera is. In other words, they don't know they are acting when they are acting. This kind of performance truly makes the expression of a innocent child's psychology and personality come to life, and of course it is very different from Shirley Temple's affectation.</p>
<h3>Plot of Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky</h3>
<p>Tong Ye from Chongqing</p>
<p>Gu was slightly injured in the 814 air battle and stayed in the hospital. Gao and Zhao came to the hospital to visit. Then the ladies of the city came to the hospital with flowers and sweets to comfort them one after another.</p>
<p>Yue Yiqin brought cigarettes and towels to the hospital to give to * air force prisoners who were injured. The * prisoners cried and were grateful, saying that they were driven by their country's warlords and did not want to fight.</p>
<p>Bai Mei Xiaoyun was also hospitalized due to being bombed. One day, * planes came to bomb wildly again, and Xiaoyun died. Gao Zhao and others were even more saddened and angry. When Zhao Dangyong pursued * planes during the battle, the * planes were able to take advantage of the team to shoot down the plane of team member Jia. Shen parachuted and was injured, and team member C, a close friend of B, scolded Zhao angrily after the battle. The brigade commander heard about it and asked the reason. The two remained silent. The brigade commander warned the two severely and placed them in confinement in accordance with military orders. One day, the two glared at each other at first, then smiled and shook hands, explaining the misunderstanding. Finally, they encouraged each other to be sincere and united, and to serve the nation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the air raid alarm wailed loudly, and the team members took off to kill * The team member B was in the garden, and Gao went to rescue him and was seriously injured. This battle also greatly defeated * planes. After the battle, the team members rushed forward and shook hands with Gao to apologize. Gao closed his mouth tightly and did not say a word. Later, he shouted "Down with Japanese imperialism" and spat blood and died.</p>
<p>Bai Shanfeng rushed over and shouted to the sky sadly, the youth of the whole country rise up, go to the sky, and defend the motherland...</p>
<p>Thousands of planes suddenly broke through the clouds and took off... (End)</p>
<h3>War Heroes Active on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>In the World War twenty-one years ago, some of the warriors on the battlefield are now demonstrating their talents in Hollywood with great vigor.</p>
<p>Herbert Marshall, Ronald Colman, Leslie Howard, etc., were all British soldiers twenty years ago. They went to war for their country, and because of injuries, they embarked on a new path, changing to the stage and screen.</p>
<p>Before the war, Leslie Howard was a bank clerk, and Herbert Marshall was an accountant. At that time, they probably only thought about addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division all day long. Not to mention being movie actors, even the term "movie" was a bit unfamiliar and jarring to them. Marshall's prosthetic leg is a result of that time.</p>
<p>Colman was wounded by a bullet in the Battle of Waterloo and groaned in the hospital for several months. This is still considered lucky; otherwise, movie fans would not have the pleasure of appreciating his art.</p>
<p>The heroic George O'Brien was a radio operator on a submarine at the time. We can imagine how dangerous that career was. On November 11th, the armistice was signed, and everyone was ecstatic, but O'Brien could not be found anywhere. After searching carefully, they found him lying on the wireless telegraph machine, his shoulders twitching. Yes, he was sobbing.</p>
<p>The veteran Luis Alberni participated in the Spanish war before the Great War and still holds the honorary title of Major in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen—Hollywood's rough-line star—suffered two or three minor injuries during the war. His brothers jokingly called him "Lucky." He was once a lieutenant in the British infantry, stationed in Mesopotamia, and almost killed by the natives. On another occasion, he was almost killed for someone's life, thereby making great contributions. The King of England specially summoned him, encouraged him with words, and commended him. McLaglen often said to people, "Armistice Day—November 11th—has two different feelings for me..." Of course, everyone hopes for peace, but he hopes for a few more rounds of fighting to show off his skills.</p>
<p>...Also, many other people, tens of thousands of people, probably cannot completely forget November 11, 1918.</p>
<p>Adolphe Menjou was still an officer at the time, wearing a neat military uniform, as fond of beauty as he is today, commanding the armored vehicles to fight. He stood in his important position, looking around with binoculars.</p>
<p>Harpo Marx (one of the Marx Brothers) was then a famous war correspondent for the New York Seventh Regiment's "Stars and Stripes" newspaper. His true face was that of a young debater. How could he resemble the strange image on the screen with his permed red hair and affected mannerisms?</p>
<p>John Bowers was a war correspondent during the Great War. Ronald Young was originally British, but later injured and became an American citizen. Also, Buster Keaton, the deadpan comedian, was the first of Hollywood's stars to enlist in the military. He always keeps a straight face and never smiles—whether on or off the screen—perhaps somewhat related to the cruel stimulation of the war!</p>
<p>In addition, Boris Karloff, martial arts star Buck Jones, Jack Holt, Melvyn Douglas, etc., were all brave warriors who had been to the front lines during the World War. Buck Jones suffered a severe foot injury while in a regiment in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Also, if we were to write about a few more famous stars who participated in the World War, there would be Lew Ayres, Walter Connolly, Leo Carrillo, Nelson Eddy, Spencer Tracy, Bruce Cabot...etc.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, twenty-one years have passed in an instant. Human affairs are changing, and things change rapidly. At that time, we or they—the stars—who could have predicted today, twenty-one years later?</p>

<h3>Xu He Cup Second Battle: South China Narrowly Defeats the Army United Team; Hui Tang's National Prestige Not on the Front Lines, Offensive and Defensive Strength Slightly Reduced; Trapped in a Difficult Battle, Resulting in Only a 2-1 Victory</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The spring scenery is charming, the flowers and birds are teasing; these days, the hooves of horses are swift in Happy Valley, and the ball players are also in high spirits.</p>
<p>The second battle of the Xu He Cup kicked off yesterday afternoon at the Navy Field. The two teams were quite strong, and the battle was extremely tense. The distinguished guests in the audience were also captivated. After all, China was one step higher and sang the song of victory again.</p>
<p>The final score was 2-1, indicating that South China's victory was very difficult. This was because the players of the Army United Team fought bravely and resisted tirelessly. Fortunately, the game was changed to a seventy-minute system; otherwise, the soldiers' endurance would have given them an advantage in the end.</p>
<p>There were slight changes in the Chinese lineup. Li Huitang, the commander of the forward, suffered from a river fish disease and could not be on the front lines. He was replaced by Chen Dehui. Li Guowei was also absent, and Liu Mao was transferred to guard the left inner defense. As a result, both the offensive and defensive aspects were slightly affected.</p>
<p>The Army only replaced another with Jia because of a last-minute withdrawal.</p>
<p>South China's team fell into a losing situation first because Liu Mao caused trouble. He was slow in his movements, weak in kicking the ball, and useless in defending the fortress. There were often dangerous situations in front of the goal, all due to his poor defense. I believe that the old Liu is already showing signs of decline and is no longer suitable for use. The reason why they could not win by a larger margin was that Dehui frequently missed opportunities. Even if he had a way to break through, he had no way to complete the final shot at the goal. Therefore, although they often had the advantage, they only won by a small margin. If Huitang had been on the field, they would not have been trapped in a difficult battle, nor would they have only scored two goals.</p>
<p>"Pull one hair and the whole body moves." The issue of personnel is indeed very important. If South China had fought according to the original lineup, they would not have won so difficultly. Who knew that only two people were changed, and the ones who repeatedly missed opportunities were precisely these two people. It can be said to be extremely precise.</p>
<p>However, Dehui's good performance in rushing and突擊 cannot be erased, only that his shooting was inaccurate. Liu Mao, on the other hand, did more harm than good. No wonder those who saw it all blamed him. "Old pearls are worthless." The old Liu can rest.</p>
<p>In my opinion, South China seemed to have contracted "hemiplegia" in this game. Several players on the left side, such as Liu Mao, Xie Jinhong, and Luo Douwen, all performed poorly. Therefore, when retreating, the left side was considered a concern, and when attacking, the left side was also considered unreliable, resulting in a畸形 battle situation. However, although Douwen was not satisfactory, he had slightly reduced the mistakes of excessive dribbling compared to before.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation of yesterday's battle, South China had opportunities to win goals at all times, and also had the danger of losing goals at all times. The creation of those opportunities depended on Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong's drilling everywhere and Deng Guangsen's opening roads, Dehui's central breakthrough, and Liang Rongzhao and Guo Yingqi's supply from behind also contributed. As for the occurrence of danger, it was obvious that Liu Mao and Jinhong had no defensive skills. Fortunately, Li Tiansheng, Rongzhao, Yingqi, etc., assisted觔園, and Zhang Rongcai miraculously saved the day, thus avoiding the disaster.</p>
<p>The Army's front line progressed rapidly, and South China's hinterland was often breached, and they were able to avoid the solid and take advantage of the虚, often using the right wing to invade. However, the forwards were not good at shooting, and several sure-win balls landed in the wilderness. Therefore, South China was able to maintain its victory and it was fortunate.</p>
<p>The center-back was special, and his skills were quite commendable, but he had just entered the grand hall and still needed to settle down and work. Jia, on the other hand, could not stop Deng Guangsen's activities, and his skills were very mediocre. Rites also did not have a distinct performance, so the entire forward line felt weak. It was common to see South China's forwards using wonderful short passes, confusing them, and running in vain.</p>
<p>Shi Han and Fraser temporarily switched positions, which is why they did not mesh well. Therefore, Dehui's central breakthrough was often able to charge straight in, but it was a pity that Dehui missed many shots. However, it was also because Deng Qin performed exceptionally well and repeatedly saved the day, so he did not lose too much. He and Rongcai can be said to have complemented each other, each contributing to their own team.</p>
<p>Now that South China has won this battle, it is tied with the Navy. It is hoped that they will work harder and not lose all their efforts. If they win the decisive battle with the Navy on the 22nd of this month, they will regain the championship. As for the Army, they have lost both battles and have been expelled from the scope of争标.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The two teams faced each other, and the battle began immediately. No sooner said than done, it was already seen that 哥路滑 was riding his horse across the river, and 葛尼 was following behind to charge in. Liu Mao came out to meet him and resisted forcefully, resulting in a鐵鏟 trick. Not only was it ineffective, but it violated the rules of heaven and was penalized with a twelve-yard ball, which was kicked by 梳士 into the net. Rongcai wanted to save it but could not do anything about it.</p>
<p>After a while, Deng Guangsen raised the banner, and Dehui responded in the middle, immediately attacking the goal. Deng Qin dodged to save it, barely avoiding disaster. However, at this time, the Army was still in turmoil, but seeing the armored cavalry galloping horizontally and vertically, Rongzhao intercepted the ball, sent it forward, and Dehui shot it smoothly, but was again扑出 by Deng Qin. In this fierce battle, Zhaorong突至 solo,扣即入, 勞勤 closed the door too late, and a 1-1 draw was achieved.</p>
<p>At sixteen minutes, 達非路 committed an offense, and suddenly launched a cold arrow that entered the net in response, but the referee clearly saw that 葛尼 was offside first, and it was like entering a treasure mountain and returning empty-handed.</p>
<p>Zhaorong broke through the defense and passed the ball far to Douwen. Dehui crossed the river at the same time and shot at the door. Deng Qin bravely saved the day, but Dehui was determined to win and attacked again. Deng Qin扑了一個空 in front of him, and it looked like there was no saving it. Unexpectedly, Shi Han and Fraser拼命杀全, and still could not find their way in, until Jingxiang急行掃射, but hit the lintel, blocking the disaster for Deng Qin.</p>
<p>At twenty-two minutes, Jingxiang started a war in the Central Plains, and Dehui charged into the陣地. Shi Han came out to meet him, and Dehui quickly dodged and shot a地球, and Deng Qin's line of sight was blocked, and he could not save it, 2-1, South China won the counterattack.</p>
<p>Soon, Guangsen迂週 passed the ball, and it was切中 just right. Dehui received it and attacked the goal, but it was拒出 by Deng Qin. Zhaorong伏兵突起, but unfortunately the shooting power was insufficient and was saved. After another time, the first half ended, 2-1 South China won first.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After the restart, South China gained momentum again, but Jingxiang's powerful shot was ineffective, and the forward retreated. Suddenly, 哥路滑 was seen killing into单骑, and Liu Mao came out to meet him, fighting a battle, and 哥路滑 was finally injured in the brave battle and left the field. He returned shortly after.</p>
<p>葛尼 again侵采, and 梳士 responded with an arrow, and fortunately, Rongcai's rescue was effective, and才吿 nothing happened. However, 梳士 was determined to succeed, and conspired with 達非路,賺過洪, and at this time, South China's陣地,险状环生,幸奄巴臣 went to的是過其炮,才化险为夷.</p>
<p>At twenty-two minutes, 禮地士 sent糧 to 達非路,冲前迎顶 was very dangerous, and Rongcai托救出界, but only lost a corner kick, and the Army did not benefit from this.已而哥路滑 broke through中關, 葛尼 responded and shot immediately, but it became a野矢 again.</p>
<p>South China counterattacked, Jingxiang's pass was very good, and Dehui intercepted the ball, a單刀赴會. At this time, the Army's rear defense was空虚, 风声窗泪, and 匝奈 Deng Qin was extremely alert, abandoning the city to intercept and save, and渡过危機.</p>
<p>Guangsen started an uprising in the frontier and approached the door,立傳兆榮,迎头一顶, but it was a difference of an inch, but Zhaorong 接再接再属, 再弄過菲沙,發炮射門, and the ball hit the门柱,卒被機殊大脚勾销.</p>
<p>梳士 broke through关而入, 葛尼 sounded east and击西, and at a considerable point, 梳士 shot, Rongcai抢险,负一个角球, but the Army also无所建树, and at this point it became a battle of chaos, each other back and forth, for a long time, and no one再获, and the signal to end the game sounded, and South China won 2-1. The two teams are as follows (Stadium太歲)</p>

<h3>Today's Lawn Tennis Matches: Both Doubles Matches Are Worth Watching</h3>
<p>Today's open lawn tennis tournament has one singles match and two doubles matches, all held at 4:30 PM at the Hong Kong Cricket Club ground. Among them, the most dare to watch is the 变打 Li Rurong He Jialiu army war 皮亞十德孚.

<h3>Open Basketball Tournament: Eastern Loses to South China; Youth Team Wins First Game of Group B, Journalists Lose to Huaxiong Association in Second Game</h3>
<p>In the open men's basketball tournament, the Eastern faced South China in the A group last night. The former has been composed of famous players from all over the world, with the aura of overlooking everything, but in this competition, it has been defeated by South China, so the Eastern is more likely to win. Unexpectedly, the result of this game was another upset, and South China won 53-47.</p>
<p>The tense part of the tens of minutes of the game process has been rarely seen since the start of the game. Not only did the two sides draw several times, but the victory or defeat of both sides was like a swift rush, and Shi Zhida's feat in South China was very great. From time to time, he shoots through Yang in a hundred steps, and from time to time, he pushes and pulls under the basket, and he always succeeds in his efforts, and Chen Xinqiu's two exploits of strong attack and dark attack are also indispensable. All the other sons are worthy of their duties, and Zheng Yukun scored four goals in a row in the last seven points, which is no different from laying the foundation for victory. The excellent communication of the whole team is also the reason for its victory.</p>
<p>South China adopted the counter-jump pass method to avoid the opponent's interception, which is still effective. Because the Eastern players are tall, it is advantageous to seize the interception, so this method makes the Eastern helpless. At the same time, it can better coordinate time and space, so whether attacking or retreating, it has achieved ideal results. As for the Eastern's defeat, although it was due to Feng Nianhua's lack of wonderful performance, Huang Dingfen's repeated victories were also the reason for its defeat. Sun Baoqing and Chen Zongqi grabbed rebounds, although they saw their skills, but the forward only relied on Luo Ji'an, who gained a little, so the first half was still able to take the lead, and the second half abandoned Luo and used Zhong Guo, and the offensive was even less motivated, which led to the reversal of defeat.</p>
<p>After the start, South China's Shi Zhenda took advantage of the penalty kick and opened the record first. Then Huang Dingfen returned with color, and after a long time of melee, the two sides held each other at 5 to 5 and 9 to 9. In a blink of an eye, they saw each other's victory and defeat at 10 to 11 and 14 to 13. After 19 to 19, Huang Dingfen got a chance at the bottom of the basket and made two free throws, creating the highest record of 29 to 21. Until the end of the half, he still won 29 to 25 first.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shi Zhida of South China was unstoppable and caught up with 29 to 29 first, and then won 33 to 29. Until Shi Zhenda was fouled out with four penalties, and Zheng Yukun was changed, the offensive of South China was even stronger. Chen Xinqiu and Zheng Yukun showed their power one after another, and Feng Nianhua of the East did not show weakness. The two sides tied at 37 to 37. At 49 to 40, the East was still struggling hard, and South China got Zheng Yukun to score several goals in a row in the last few minutes of the game, and finally defeated the East 53 to 47.</p>
<p>In the last game, Huaxiong played against the police. Both teams are strong teams in Group B this year and have the hope of winning the championship, so the battle was quite fierce. In the first half, Huaxiong took the lead with 17 to 13. In the second half, the police tried their best to counterattack. Chen Guo repeatedly shot in the middle, and once reversed the defeat into victory. Nothing happened, but Huaxiong also approached from all sides, and the police were unable to cope, and lost 25 to 37. In the first game, the reporter lost to the Qing team 33 to 48. The results of each game are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday's Horse Race: Two Upsets, Winner Takes All Over $400 Per Ticket</p>
<p>The results of yesterday's horse races showed relatively small payouts for the winner-takes-all. However, there were sudden upsets in the eighth and ninth races. In the eighth race, Yuan Shaoliu's The士加和利卑 (transliterated), surprisingly won. The winner-takes-all paid out $434.30 per ticket, and the place paid out $75 per ticket. In the ninth race, Pu Laosuo's Flying Eagle won, with the winner-takes-all paying out $156.50 per ticket. As for the first race, Nuss Irica again emerged victorious, with a time of 1 minute and 55 seconds, matching the old record set by Dai Yanna Bi. In the third race, Jing Gang almost defeated Jenny Flower, although it ultimately finished second. However, its time of 1 minute and 59 seconds for one mile was truly exceptional. Never before had an old horse burdened with so much weight achieved such a result. With further improvement, its future is limitless, and we should pay attention to it. The fifth and seventh double event resulted in a payout of $88.40 per ticket because both races were moderately surprising. Among the jockeys, Bi Haoqing and Pu Laosuo shared the top spot, each winning twice. The remaining races were won by Yan Jiana Sheng, Lie Da, Chen Chunsheng, Yuan Shaoliu, Li Wenyuan Bai Li, etc., each winning once.</p>
<p>Economic Column: Imported Cosmetics Imports Increase Greatly This Year.</p>
<p>February's Totaled $59,799, Japanese Goods Accounted for $31,482.</p>
<p>Imported cosmetics such as perfume, rouge, creams, and powders have been sold to various parts of our country in recent years in large quantities. During January 1938, the average monthly import reached approximately $10,798. Among these, perfume and rouge were mostly imported from the United States, reaching $3,477, followed by France with $2,328, and then Germany with $1,274. Japan only accounted for $647, and finally, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong accounted for $4989 and $195 respectively. As for the import of creams and powders, Japan ranked first, followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, although they also imported, the quantity was far less than Japan. By the beginning of this year, the import of these cosmetics has increased steadily. In February of this year, the number increased to $59,799. Imports from various countries have also increased. In particular, Japan, due to its control of the administration of customs in our occupied areas and the unauthorized modification of tax rates to benefit the import of Japanese goods, has seen a special increase in the import of these cosmetics such as perfume, rouge, creams, and powders. Japan has jumped to the top spot in imports to our country. In January 1938, Japan's import of perfume and rouge was only $647, and powder was $970, but by February of this year, the former suddenly increased to $14,400 and the latter increased to $17,082, totaling $31,482. The speed of the increase is the highest among all countries. The other countries, such as France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, have also increased compared to before. France increased to $11,976, the United States $6,926, the United Kingdom $812, and Hong Kong $702. The increased import of these cosmetics is quite detrimental to our country's finances. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance of our country has now established a Trade Commission, which has begun to reduce the import surplus of various commodities.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Jiang Lao Yao by Luo Feng — One of the Figures in the Rear</p>
<p>From Junqing to Jiangshen, when I was staying at a friend's relatives' house, I became acquainted with their landlord, Jiang Laoyao.</p>
<p>This Sichuanese man was not tall, with a broad and flat torso, and a pale, zongzi-shaped face crowded with protruding features. At first glance, he gave a stifling feeling; however, when looking at his eyes or mouth alone, he was very pleasant, because both eyes and mouth revealed an unusually clever, unusually sharp ability.</p>
<p>"It can be considered fate," he began, rolling his seemingly elusive black eyes, emphasizing the final syllable, "If it weren't for the Japanese devils, those bastards! Where would you people from Jiangnan have ended up coming to our Jiangbei?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, if it weren't for the Japanese ××, how could we have seen the Wu Gorge that we'd always imagined?"</p>
<p>"But, some ignorant people have misinterpreted you," he habitually bent his back, dipping his fingertip in his lower lip, "Those bastards, can you guess what they say?——They say: "The people from Jiangnan have all become rich, flying to Sichuan like locusts to eat oranges. They come to enjoy themselves, but we suffer disaster!" Look, isn't that a joke?——"</p>
<p>"There's no way around it," I continued with a silent smile, "Maybe some came specifically to eat oranges in Sichuan, but in any case, the thrifty Sichuanese have definitely been affected."</p>
<p>"But, if you leave home, I'm afraid there isn't a more suitable person to manage your complicated household affairs, is there?" I worried about Jiang Laoyao.</p>
<p>"I don't want the family! I made up my mind long ago!" He pronounced the character "xin" (heart) with a resounding, drawn-out falling tone. That single word could make one feel ashamed and arouse one's fighting spirit, "But yes, those bastards, my old man will never let me go, look how anxious it makes one, isn't it"?</p>
<p>"This is pretty much a universal phenomenon——the previous generation always likes to obstruct what our generation wants to do; but, it's not difficult to break through it——"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," Jiang Laoyao widened his eyes and said confidently. "Our methods are much more numerous than theirs."</p>
<p>Although he never explained what those methods were, I always looked forward to the day when this Jiang Laoyao, who was full of resilience, would realize his methods. "The cost of living has suddenly increased, and daily necessities have all risen to one to two times the price, how can the poor cope?"</p>
<p>"That's right, but simply blaming the people from Jiangnan, ignoring the Japanese ××, those bastards, look how ignorant that is!……If they don't sympathize, are they still going to begrudge the people from Jiangnan?"</p>
<p>Jiang Laoyao's words reminded me of the general behavior of Sichuanese merchants, who unscrupulously cheated and exploited outsiders, so I said:</p>
<p>"The most heartless are the merchants. As soon as they hear an unfamiliar accent, they raise the prices and put on an attitude of "take it or leave it"……"</p>
<p>"There are even more ruthless ones," he bent his back, jumping in to say, "For example, those bastards, as soon as they hear your accent, they simply ignore you."</p>
<p>Jiang Laoyao hadn't finished speaking when Mrs. Bai—the hostess of the friend's relatives' house—called me urgently. I waved my hand and said to Jiang Laoyao, "Let's talk again," and hurriedly went into the house.</p>
<p>I stood by the door, questioning Mrs. Bai with doubt:</p>
<p>"Is something the matter?"</p>
<p>"Nothing's the matter," she answered with a smile, "What are you talking to him about? If you're not afraid of wasting your breath, it would be more interesting to talk to our cat……"</p>
<p>This was another one of her prejudices. When I arrived, she had told me that their landlord—Jiang Laoyao—was an extremely cunning and disrespectful character. This judgment came about due to a housing dispute.</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Bai herself, when they first rented Jiang Laoyao's house, it was originally agreed upon that it would be five rooms. When they were preparing to move in, Jiang Laoyao suddenly changed his mind and said very arrogantly: "You can only rent two rooms, otherwise you get none!" Therefore, they argued with each other for an hour, but Jiang Laoyao still insisted on his original proposal. In the end, they brandished the seal of a certain ×× agency, threatening to seal his front door. Only then did Jiang Laoyao soften. Later, Jiang Laoyao and they, on the other hand, unusually showed goodwill.</p>
<p>However, these words did not deepen my dislike for Jiang Laoyao, because not long ago, even now, the so-called magic weapon of power could still defeat the defenseless weak.</p>
<p>Before this, I only knew that Jiang Laoyao was the youngest son of Jiang Erye, a large property owner in this area. But after my second conversation with Jiang Laoyao, I also learned that he was not only a profligate officer but also a relative of anti-Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>"However, unfortunately," Jiang Laoyao said with a sigh, "my second elder brother sacrificed in the Battle of Shanghai, and my third elder brother died in Huangmei, Hubei—he was only twenty-eight years old, two years older than me, those bastards, to die at such a young age is truly heartbreaking!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his nostrils twitched painfully, and in his eye sockets were buried shining tears of unbearable pity. This moving scene stirred my clumsy eloquence, making it even clumsier, and I simply didn't know how to make up a sentence that might comfort him.</p>
<p>"……It's rare to have two elder brothers who sacrificed for the nation…it's truly glorious……"</p>
<p>Although my words were ordinary, they were able to wipe away his pain, and joyful lines immediately appeared at the corners of his eyes and mouth. The black eyes began to roll elusively again.</p>
<p>"Glorious?—I feel this is a huge debt—" Jiang Laoyao habitually bent over again and stretched out his small fist, as pale as his face, imitating an attacking posture in front of my stomach, "If I don't get this debt back from those Japanese ××, there will be no one else."</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<p>Collective Research by Huang Sheng</p>
<p>Theory lags behind works, research lags behind creation. We see this shortcoming in the literary and artistic front.</p>
<p>The fundamental task of current literature and art is to coordinate with the entire political and cultural movement to solve two urgent problems: first, mass political propaganda for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; second, a leap of literature and art to a higher stage. This is indeed a very heavy burden, so our literary and artistic activities must be meticulous and organized, and we must pursue high efficiency. The tactic of scattered skirmish lines, the style of each going its own way, and the risk of charging forward without support must be strictly accounted for. Our accounting is gradually being achieved. The literary and artistic front is expanding and developing. Removing obstacles in the future and building a ladder to ascend are our priorities; the construction of a strategy, the coordination of tactics, and the execution of a campaign are our urgent tasks. Here, we need to begin a theoretical movement in a planned and systematic way. We need to begin a research movement in a planned and systematic way. The shortcomings of theory lagging behind works and research lagging behind creation must be quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Zhou Yang pointed out in the inaugural issue of Literary and Artistic Front that, in addition to the practice of life, another important issue for writers is the issue of cultivation. We must admit that our cultivation is not enough. To acquire the full ability to express this great era, we have a great need to intensify our efforts. He further pointed out that, in terms of literary and artistic cultivation, our writers have almost all been influenced by Western literature. It is very natural and necessary for a backward country to accept the influence of advanced cultures. Our past mistake was to completely ignore our own nation's inherent culture. This suggestion is very important. Strengthening creative activities, establishing and developing theory are coordinated. Both of these depend on intensifying and deepening research, so we must begin a theoretical movement. "Advanced" cultural achievements and the nation's inherent cultural achievements are both the objects of our research.</p>
<p>Simply emphasizing the importance of life experience, regarding research as a scholar's game, many literary and artistic workers cannot express this test. However, we are also very clear that the busyness and instability of life, the constant changes in the living environment, all cause workers to temporarily put down research work. If a worker is so busy that he has little time to think, how can we ask him to conduct meticulous research? Therefore, a climate of collective research must be stirred up and cultivated, so that even the busiest workers can provide some strength in collective "labor" and collective discussion, and harvest some valuable research results and opinions. In fact, the objects of our research are very broad, and the tasks of our research are very urgent, and only collective action is efficient.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's literary and artistic workers are in a special environment, temporarily not having to suffer the hardship of running around and moving, so it is most suitable to take on a most arduous task—the work of research. We must start a collective research movement in a planned and systematic way.</p>
<p>The "Literary Association" has decided on a plan for group research, which is a very important move. We long for each group to start work as soon as possible. We must thoroughly eliminate the trivial style of "just talking casually." We must be tense, diligent, practical, and in-depth. This is the iron law for researchers.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nation and Scallions and Beef by Xiang Tian</p>
<p>In the April 4th edition of this column, I read Mr. Du Ai's "Little Neighbor," which described his little neighbor changing the words "Chinese nation" to "scallions and beef" while singing the March of the Volunteers. Although the author did not explain this unintentional observation, it can be seen as a pressing demand in the minds of today's children for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, a government should be responsible for guaranteeing the welfare and happiness of all members of that race, both male and female, young and old. The government is not only a protector during times of foreign invasion but should also be able to nurture the nation with scallions, beef, and other nutrients that sustain life and vitality.</p>
<p>The world knows that the countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, which are currently fond of killing and preparing for war, are not giving their people scallions and beef, let alone foods that contain life-sustaining nutrients, but rather iron-made bombs, guns, cannons, tanks, gas masks, and death. Isn't it true that the rulers of Japan are preaching the mainland policy and the lifeline to the masses every day with deceptive terms, but now, the Yamato nation has been forced onto the line of death, countless people have died, and countless people have become insane. How can Germany be an exception? The entire Germanic nation is tightening its belts and struggling to support itself, but the whip-wielding madman Hitler is eating fat and shouting "Eastward! Eastward!"</p>
<p>Here, we admire the new and great country of the Soviet Union. Not only do the soldiers who carry guns to defend the country have enough to eat, but women and children also have enough to eat. Their children's schools alone are worthy of praise from the whole world. According to Mr. Mei Zhen's article on socialist countries in this newspaper, there are the following statistics:</p>
<p>"In 1935-36":</p>
<p>One, there were 126,600 primary schools with 11 million students.</p>
<p>Two, there were 31,500 incomplete secondary schools with 10 million students.</p>
<p>Three, there were 6,000 secondary schools with 4.5 million students.</p>
<p>Four, in addition, there were more than 700 workers' colleges with 250,000 students.</p>
<p>In 1936-37, the number of primary and secondary school students increased to 28,842,000.</p>
<p>Truly, the happiest children in the world today should be Soviet children. They not only have "scallions and beef" but also well-equipped schools and other interesting entertainment, beneficial training, and happy lives.</p>
<p>What about Chinese children? The Children's Day that just passed a few days ago, presumably the children should be gradually abandoned again. If we compare the enjoyment and treatment of Chinese children today with those of Soviet children, of course, we will be disappointed. However, we have a firm belief that the Chinese nation can also create happiness for its own children in the future, not only providing them with enough "scallions and beef" but also transforming them into happy children who are spiritually and culturally satisfied. In the world, apart from the imperialist countries that specialize in aggression and killing and do not cherish children, forcing them to be used as cannon fodder, there are probably no countries that do not cherish children. Especially the Chinese people, who are good at embodying "love for one's own young and extending it to the young of others," cherish peace and children and cherish their own children even more! Then, from today onwards, let us work hard to help the War of Resistance, defeat the traitors, and drive out the robbers, so that we have the opportunity to protect our own children and enable children to have enough "scallions and beef" one day!</p>
<p>Against Lenience by Zheng Yulang</p>
<p>Lenience is the intention of the benevolent. "Combining kindness and severity" is necessary for handling affairs, governing, and leading troops. But we must never forget that lenience should be restricted by morality and facts. If lenience is applied unconditionally, then lenience can easily turn into "appeasement," causing the evil result of "raising a tiger to cause trouble."</p>
<p>For matters that do not absolutely violate morality, matters that are relatively small, and matters where the violators are only temporarily ignorant, we may as well show lenience according to the circumstances. But for those who violate morality, whose actions are sufficient to cause the country to fall and the 400 million people to become slaves, and who knowingly commit evil with the intention of doing wrong, we must not be lenient.</p>
<p>To be lenient to a certain person and his small group of cronies, while causing 450 million people to lose their lives, property, and freedom, is not only not the intention of the benevolent but is a very unbenevolent thing. If lenience is used in this way, we should oppose it.</p>
<p>For those who sell out the country and the nation and have the intention of doing evil, our government should handle them strictly. "Mercy beyond the law" cannot be invoked for them.</p>
<p>Because there are countless events in history where we have regretted the unrestricted, unconditional application of lenience. Here, there is no need to cite historical facts from ancient times. Let us take recent events as an example: After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, we were too lenient towards the deceased Qing royal family. We did not impose appropriate restrictions, nor did we organize a court like the French Revolution when it succeeded to sentence King Louis XVI for "bringing disaster to the country and harming the people" and send him to the guillotine. As a result, there was Zhang Xun's restoration attempt and the current affair of the × people bringing out the young Pu Yi to organize the "puppet Manchuria."</p>
<p>After the success of the Northern Expedition, we were too lenient towards the old warlords and old bureaucrats. We did not hold them accountable under national law. As a result, there was the appearance of Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and other traitors, who established a puppet government.</p>
<p>"Governing the world requires the use of severe punishments" is a historically insightful and absolutely true famous saying. During the serious period of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, we must be strict with those who sell out the country and the nation and endanger the Republic of China. Only strictness is permissible, lenience is absolutely not permissible.</p>
<p>The Snow of Manchuria by Shu Qun</p>
<p>In his eyes, there were hidden tears, and he slowly moved closer to her side, gently tightening her collar for her and smoothing the strands of hair scattered by the wind. He hoped for all possibilities, giving her the last comfort. She retreated inexplicably, avoiding him—she feared he would damage the sanctity of her self-respect and chastity. Suddenly, when he grasped her hand, in that instant, he seemed to be saying, who does not cherish their youth? Who does not compare the fire of their youth to the morning sun—a bright sacred season? It seemed to be saying that in this universe, there would be a strange separation, this separation is a painful memory of life. After parting, there will be eternal longing. Before parting, can there be no lingering affection? It seemed to be saying that there was no resentment between them, but he could not use her blood to write a responsibility, a record of a successful undertaking, although after it was written, one would suffer and the other would be innocent. It seemed to be saying that releasing someone is not easy, but killing someone is even harder. Wouldn't the hand that kills and the heart of the one being killed tremble equally?</p>
