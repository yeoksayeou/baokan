<h3 id="c1">目前的抗戰形勢 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>目前全面抗戰局勢，極呈樂觀氣象，各綫反攻，捷報紛傳，我們苟免於炮火寄身於海外的同胞，自當於期望之餘，大感興奮吧！</p>
<p>近日各路前線之所以迭報勝利，最爲吾人听不能忽視者，是我們各路前線及淪陷區內軍民的浴血苦鬥，這是我們於聞訊興奮之時，所當謹向此等英勇之戰士，献致崇高的民族敬禮的。但同局吾人猶應明瞭，前線及×後千萬戰士之所以能够苦戰獲勝，一有賴於汪精衞等××××陰謀的敗露，二有賴於最高領袖與中央政府之堅持圑結抗戰國策，三有賴於全國人民一致擁護政府領袖，痛切反對『反共和平』等等降×賣國言論行爲。因爲有些三者，始能使前綫及×後的千萬戰士，益堅其最後勝利的信心，而能一往直前誓死殺×；因爲有此三者，始能使國際輿論與友邦政府人民，益增其同情與尊敬中國的信心，而能加緊步驟援華制日。</p>
<p>然而目前各綫反攻的勝利，尙非决定今後全部抗戰的勝利。×人開始各綫的挫敗，也不是×軍總崩潰的表現。依據一般可靠估計，×人在此政治陰謀新告挫敗之際，必定又有新的軍事上的投機冒險，以圖補充政治陰謀，實行新的攻畧。×人這種新的軍事投機胃險，自攻陷南昌以後，隨時隨處都在積極準備：雖因我們斷然展開各綫反攻，使×人此種準備工作使×遭受重大打擊，但是當×人戰鬥力尙未遭遇致命的打擊，國際的制裁和本國的革命亦尙未　展到不能作戰的程度之時，×人不僅决不會就此鳴金收軍，而且還必會加緊其投機胃險的步驟的！最近所傳福州汕頭形勢緊急，實際上雖爲×人企圖解救廣州之圍，但×人未嘗不想奪取新的據點，以謀策應其粵漢路及粵南的作戰計劃，而達到强化東南佔領區的夢想。再從我國抗戰局勢說，目前確已從二十餘月的艱苦戰鬥之中，到了全部轉机的時候了！到了由劣敗轉向優勝的時候了！</p>
<p>目前各綫的反攻，雖還不是未來驅逐日×的全面總反攻；甚至目前各綫的形勢，雖然還有遭受更大危險的可能；但是只從目前我軍的勝利之展開和×人的困之加重來看，已可增加我們抗戰必勝的更大的信心了！我們目前的任務，雖還不是展開全面總反攻，驅逐日×出中國，逐漸收囘失地，但是必須集中全力來保持各綫業已或漸將取得　優勝地位、並且以全力來發展這種優勝形勢，打擊×人新的更大的軍事的投機冒險，準備全面的總反攻，迎擊最後勝利。爲要達成這個總的任務，我們在軍事上，支持及發展前綫及×後的反攻：這幾天我們在中部戰塲迭次收復高安通山衝入武寧，制止了向長沙進迫的×軍，在南方戰塲迭次收復增城從化新會等縣，制止了向粵桂窺伺的×軍；在北部和東部戰塲，分別進攻開封，信陽，徐州，保定，北平，杭州，南京及兩淮流域各地，牽制了華北和華東×軍之向粵漢與華南增援；因此我們目前必須從物質上精神上帮助政府增强前綫的戰鬥力，發展□後的游擊戰，保持及展開各戰塲的攻勢，制止×人新的進攻。同時還要分從政治和外交上努力；政治上要擁護中央及最高領袖，鞏固全國的團結，嚴厲懲處降×賣國××××等，澈底掃除違反抗戰建國的反共和平等言論行動，而以推行國民精神總動員爲當前的中心工作：在外交上要適應國際反侵略陣綫運動，加緊國際宣傳和國民外交運動，以要求美國停運軍火赴日等實際工作，擴大援華制日運動，爭取更多更大的外援。我們要克盡這種任務，才能保持及發展目前的勝利，才能提前實現全面總反攻，驅逐×人出中國，完成抗戰建國的大業。</p>
<h3 id="c2">上海社會教育之現狀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— A．N．</p>
<p>社會敎育，範圍原極廣泛，上海又爲中國最大都市，擁有三百餘萬人口，爲適應環境需要，社會事業亦特殊發達，除政府機關撥款興辦外，私人創設者亦屬不少。但抗戰開始後，政府舉辦之事業，十九淪陷戰區，其少數未陷戰區者，亦以經費來源斷絕。宣吿停頓　迄今尚能　在者，俱爲私人創設性質，而其施敎對象，亦僅限於租界市民，較之戰前，誠不勝滄桑之感。茲先就戰前官辦事業之淪入日軍手及陷於停頓者概述於後。</p>
<p>一·民衆敎育館滬市市立民衆教育舘原設　南文廟路，規模宏大，事務發達，各種附屬事業，辦理均著成績，實爲全市社會敎育最完善最充實之實施機關，抗戰後即陷戰區。</p>
<p>二·圖書館市立圖書館原有三所，一爲上海市圖書館，在市中心區，一爲市立圖書館附設於民衆敎育館，一爲流通圖書館在邑廟，三所中以市圖書館爲規模最大，建　最新，戰後或燬於火，或爲日軍所用。</p>
<p>三·博物館，設市中心區，建築富麗堂皇，內容亦頗充實，戰事爆發後，除少數珍品曾遷安全地帶外，餘已散失殆書，其官殿式之巨厦，且爲僞市府强行佔用。</p>
<p>四·體育場，規模最大者爲上海市體育場。建築之偉大，遠東無出其右者；此外尚有市立第一體育場，位於滬南大吉路，規模較小；至商易體育場，則散處各鄕鎭，悉由當地學校兼管，戰後已全部陷落，市體育場各項建築，且有一部份被燬於砲火，近已爲日軍佔作兵營。</p>
<p>五·動物園設於滬南文朝路，與民衆敎育館爲對隣，所畜各種動物，除一部份遷置顧家宅公園公開展覽外，餘悉被難。</p>
<p>六·植物園位於滬南龍華路，戰前已改隸市立園林塲，地處僻靜環境淸幽，所植奇卉異葩，無慮數千種，戰後悉陷日軍之手。</p>
<p>七·民衆閱報處散佈市立各鎭，不下數白處，戰前　由社會局指定各學校　辦，或以原報張貼或經改編爲壁報，戰後隨學校之停辦而全部消滅。</p>
<p>八·識字學校　上海於二十四年七月起，卽開始大規模識字敎育之相行，至廿六年六月止，先後共辦六屆，每屆四個月。實施方針，包括兩大部份，一爲文字敎育，一爲公民敎育，其具體目標，則爲國民道德之培養，簡易文宇之學習，普通化議之　輸，民衆生活之改善，民挨意識之養成，生產能力之訓練。辦理二年，成效大著，全市之已受識字敎育者共有三一七·五二六人，即以戰前之最後一屆卽第六屆言，全市尙設識字學校九一所，計三六八班，入學生二二·二六二人。據調合統計，全市文盲截至戰前爲止，僅餘三〇九·三三四人，較之未辦訓字敎育前，已减少文盲達半數以上，倘能待以時期，不難全部　淸。但自抗戰開始後，大好事業，卽陷停頓，可謂上海社會敎育子最大損失。</p>
<p>以上各種社會敎育事業，戰前均由政府機關主持辦理，戰後已全部停頓，無一存在。此外尙有若干事業，過去雖爲官辦，但一部份尙能遷地恢復，而現有之社敎之事業，則大部份爲私人創設或戰後新興者，茲亦倂述於後。</p>
<p>一·民衆學校</p>
<p>民衆學校過去雖爲官辦，且均散處四鄕，但自上海淪陷後，一般原任敎職員　於民衆敎育之重要，已有一部份遷入租界復校，惟數量較前大減，僅有十四五級左右，經費亦萬分支細，故亦酌收書籍雜費，以資挹注。而各項實施辦法，亦經劃一規定，茲錄其要點如左，</p>
<p>甲·宗旨遵照中華民域敎育宗旨及其實施方針，授與年長失學民衆以簡易之智識技能。</p>
<p>乙·校舍設備以借用普通學校者爲原則。</p>
<p>丙·學生男女　收，必要時得男女分設，但以十六歲以上四十歲以下爲限。</p>
<p>丁·時期每六個月爲一期，每日敎育一小時。</p>
<p>戊·程度　分初高兩級，初級相當於小學一年級，高級相當於小學三年級，得採複式編制。</p>
<p>已·學枓分量　國語：初級佔總時間百分之六十六·高級佔百分之五十。算術：初級佔總時間百分十二，高級佔百分之十。公民訓練：初級佔總時間百分之十四，高級佔百分之八。樂歌與體育：初高級各佔總時間百分之八。常識與簡易職業，初級併合於其他各科，高級各佔白　之十二。</p>
<p>庚·敎材除自編者外，採用國立編譯館及商務印書能出版之識字讀本。短期小學課本，老少通，及民衆讀　等，由抆參照學生程度，在此範園內選用</p>
<p>二·補　學校</p>
<p>上海之補習學校，一年以來，由私人創設者，如雨後春筍，已達二百餘校，學生六萬左右。各校性質，大別之可分普通敎育與職業敎育二種。所設普通敎育，着重語文，數學，及常識之補充。所謂職業敎育，則職業界之各個都門，幾已完全具備。至戰後特別發達原因，不外三種，一爲商業界此級職員求知慾之高漲，一爲普通學校學生受戰事影響無力讀舉而轉變途徑；其又一原因，則爲民間經濟力量之普遍衰落，無力負担子弟普通敎育之費用，送入補習學校，冀於短時期內獲得一技之長，爲謀生之術。有此三因，補習學校乃能蓬勃一時，惟於質的方面，或猶未能盡如人意耳。</p>
<p>三·街童教育</p>
<p>街童敎育，此爲戰後適應環境需要之最新產物，上海自戰事發生以至淪陷爲孤島後，難民　集，流浪兒童，　行街頭，到處皆是，熱心敎育人士認有救濟必要，於是募集經費，組織上海街童敎育會負　辦理，裁至目前止，已辦有街童學校三十所，合計五十級，敎育兒童四千餘人，一切敎育活動，與學校不同，敎材亦由街童敎育會規定原則」由敎師隨　自制，敎學時間亦以迎合街童之便利爲原朋，校舍則完全借甩公共場所，各　宇祠愛等等，但必要時亦借用學校校舍或民　，茲誌此項新事業之實施要點如左：</p>
<p>甲·敎育宗旨　在抉助實足年齡自六　濃至十五歲之流浪失學兒童，予以相當敎育，使其身心健全，並獲得基本知能，以適應現實生活。</p>
<p>乙·敎育方式　一，敎的方面：集會，分組，訪問，個別指導等。</p>
<p>二·養的方面：就傷童日常生活上予以醫藥矯治救助並改進其生產方法，或介　職業會　。</p>
<p>丙·實施步驟　一·登記街童·二·指導敎師。三·接洽敎育場所。四·。檢驗體格。五·規定敎育時間。六·派員　導。</p>
<p>丁·敎學日程　一·敎師準備。二·街童集合。三·淸潔檢査。四·日會——　街童歌或報吿時事常識及精神講話。五·全班的或分團的特種敎學活動，如國語算術社會設計表演等。六·唱遊及迷動。七·組會。——由各組組長主持討論組務進行事項。</p>
<p>四·難民教育</p>
<p>難民敎育，顧名思義，亦知此項敎育實爲戰後之新興事業。當上海戰事發生後，四郊難民，　集特區，收容所先後成立，由國際救濟會，慈善團聯合救濟災會，救濟戰區難民委員會，難民救濟分會，紅址字會，紅卍字會，及各同鄉會各公團等分別主辦，最多時牧容所達二百二十餘所之多。敎育辦法，各自爲政，漫無標準，敎育事務，卽由各所管理員兼任，方法亦多不同，此後各主辦機關鑒於難民敎育之重要，相率設置訓導組或敎育組，主持各該機關所轄各所之敎育事宜，但仍僅汪意於兒童部份。直至紅十字會國際委員會担負各所給養責任以後，乃組設敎育委員會，統一主持全市之難民敎育，事　設施，方入正軌，而受敎育之難民，最多時竟達十四萬九千七百人之多。至其實施內容，則六歲至十六歲之難童受兒童敎育，分國語算術常識唱歌體育等科，國語算術常識爲基本科目，必須敎育，唱歌及體育則視各所設備人才環境而定，敎育時間，每週至多廿二小時。十六當以上之難民，則受成人敎育，分識字，精神訓練，演講，說書，電影，健身操等，以識字敎育爲主，以演講說書等爲輔。每週敎育時間至少廿一小時，每週至多廿六小時。全原有生活按能或較爲智巧之難民，則更施以職業敎育，分職業訓練及生產敎育兩種，職業訓練授以職業知識及技能，生產敎育授以各種工藝製作之技術，現已開設工藝製作工場二十二種，如刺繡，縫紉，木工，編織等等，巳有出品發售。倘能持之以恒，精神推行，則消費之難民，不難一變而爲生產者矣。</p>
<p>五·里弄教育</p>
<p>所謂里弄敎育，實相等於過去之巡迴敎育，惟其巡回範圍，則以里弄爲單位耳。其實施辦法，富有流動性，凡附近並無學校，而居民衆多之里弄，卽爲其施敎場所，校舍大都借用公共場所。或熱心敎育者之餘屋。設備五分簡單，除敎育上必用者外，餘均由兒意目備，即桌椅亦由見意帶來。敎育內容則法重基本訓練，尤着重於日常生活知能及國家觀念與民族意識之灌輸。受敎者旣爲兒童，似可劃入學校敎育範圍，但以實施辦法，與學校敎育逈然不同，故實爲一種社會敎育，蓋社會敎育之對象，原不僅限於兒童也。現全市受敎於此項里弄敎育者，約有四百三十餘人，分爲七級，散處七處，每處失學兒童减少時，卽另遷其他里弄施敎，亦爲適應戰後實際需要之產物。</p>
<p>六·報童教育</p>
<p>上海爲新聞事業薈萃之區，兒童之賴舊報爲生者，數以千計，此項耳意，每日將各報所刊重要新聞，高呼街頭，到處奔馳，其足以影響民衆心坦者手　，實有施　嚴格訓練之必要，本市熱心敎育人士，　發起報童敎育之實施，現設報童學校約十級，招有學生四百餘人，除予報童以日常生活知能及語文敎育外，尤特別注意於　事常識之報吿，使每一報童能逐日聽取關於時事之要聞，其敎學時間，惟不妨得兒童售報時間爲原則，校舍均和用普通學校或其他公共場所，刻正籌集經費，力求擴充也。</p>
<p>上海之民衆體育，棄稱發達。戰前社會局特設民衆體育股，指導全市民衆體育。幷舉辦業餘運動會及競走比賽等等。市立各體育場訓練民衆體胄，不還餘力，中華全國體育協進會又主持國際運動比賽。抗戰以後，以上各機關，均巳停頓，但運動比賽，氣象依然蓬勃。除田徑賽因缺乏廣大場地殊少舉行外，足球籃球網球游泳購爭等之練習與此賽，照常進行。</p>
<p>除以上所述外，尙有其他種種社會敎育事業，不勝　述。如市立圖書館　毀後，私人設有丁香流通圖書館中國流通圖書館丁氏圖書館等，總之，戰後之上海社會敎育，公家辦者少，私人辦者多，尤以補習學校爲最發達，且有若千事業聯合設置一處，格於租界定章，未能附外公開，故確切調査，殊非易事。至新與社會敎育事業，則均爲戰事環境所需要，在此抗戰建國過程中，頗具有深長之意義也。</p>

<p>日本本部現也長久不斷地需要大量物品的輪入，尤其爲日本自己不出的產原料。這便需要外匯，用以在世界仔貨豐富的市場　買這些物品。日本輸入　要隨着她的軍備的增加，和工業設備的擴張，而且見　高。日本　望依靠控制原料的新來源，和外匯的收入，而更可在輸入市面不依賴外會。這是對華作戰的另一動　，也是希圖將『日圓集團一展至征服的士地的另一原因。由此可見關於這點的成敗，便是日本努力用—日圓集團』以求擴張輸處業的將來成敗的條件上的主要因素。就輸入物品的供給而論，日本帝國所給予的結果，不及她對輸出市場所給的優美。在此次戰事發生之前，日本本部的輸出總額，三大屬地所佔的部分如下：台灣百分之九。八，朝鮮百分之一四·二，『滿洲國』百分之六，三，總共百分之三〇·三。日本所需的糧食，都由這三地供給，（糧食實在已佔三地售與『母國』的物品的大部分。）但三地在日本工業上所需的重要原料，和其他物品的輸入總數中所佔的部分，却比上述數宇少得多。中國在戰前對日本的輸出，佔日本本部向外方所購的總數百分之四二，現在中國商業上最重要的城市已併入『日圓集團』，日本現正在儘力利用由中國輸入更多物品的機會，但結果却令日人失望，雖日人在佔領地區內所見有價値的物品，都能伸手攫取，將購買中國產品的外人，排斥出境；雖日人在華購物，不冉需用外匯；雖日人抑價强買，或常常照國內慣行的手段，實際將東西沒收。</p>
<p>一九三八年最前八個月內，日本由華北輸入的每月平均數，比一九三六年已增高三倍半。在這時期內，華中仍有軍事的大擾亂，日本由該地區的輸入，已落至只及從前的五分之一。但一旦境內狀况和華北相近，可望有同樣的增加。最後華中的利源，也將照樣榨取日人發展的計劃，雖有　些可能的希望，但是戰勝者深知縱然能得到意想中最大的成績，仍不能使日本因中國而少倚賴其他外國供給她的需要。這又是日本利用極完善美的機會，將中國併入「日圓集團」的另一原因；不但爲了要將有用於日本的中國每種原料，完全榨出，並且爲了要使中國優多供給外匯以充日本源源向外國市場購進物品的付欵。所以日本的『大日圓集團』所須應付的主要問題，便是外匯。在中日戰事之前，日本帝國在外匯上是極不滿意的。今再回說一九三六年，那時朝鮮臺灣和日本本部相同，都苦外匯不足。她們由外國，即非日本國購物的總數雖小，却仍比售給這些國的總數超過許多。一九三六年她們共給的人超數，由日本用外匯付出的，總計共達日金五千七百三十萬元。</p>
<p>據正式對外貿易報吿，同年日本自己的入超數，共日金七千零八十萬元。但是入起的最大部份，（一九三六年日本因此不得不付出巨欵，而將外匯的目由金凖備全數用盡，到了一九三七年開戰之初，又被迫開始出售巨數黄金。）是跟「滿洲國」和她在關東租借地的轉運口岸大連有關，這兩處日本屬地是『日圓集團』的發起份子入超共達日金二萬五千八百七十萬元，她們出入貿易上所差之數，的確全由她們和日本本部互作交易而起，因爲她們向　母國一所購的　數，遠過她們賞給『母團』的總數。但是因爲日本本部和『滿洲國』關宋租借地　這種貿易，雙方在日本所謂對外貿易報吿中都紀載不實，又因爲雙方依此類推，故意將日本的入超减至至小之攻，所以這個所差之數，應方列爲以彌補日本帝國和各國往來貿易上對比短少總數的三項中的最大一項，倘若，滿洲國』倂入一日圓集團一，未使日本能够將『滿洲國』和非日本的各外國交易中賣出高額的大豆所得到的餘多外滙。提供自用，　末，上述的差數，恐怕還要增昌日金一萬萬圓以上。這一點是不能忽視的。</p>
<p>蚣本外匯之絕對空虛</p>
<p>日本外匯問題，現已比前更見嚴重。日本在對華戰爭的第一年，已耗去金準備百分之五〇，這些黄　不得不在海外售去，以抵補帝　對外貿易的入超差額。再者。這一年的戰爭中，日本又爲維持共積存而大量增購軍需原料，僅由此棉花羊毛美國木料這三項存貨。一已用去百分之六〇一已用去三分之七〇。一用去百分之八〇　。而通常需要的外國原料，更减少至不能繼續維時其輸入的程度，若長此以往，那末，如含有外國原料的棉有一類日本製造品之輸出業，便有全盤停歇的危險。因此外匯問題已使日本領袖心中更惴惴，于是他們在對『日圓集團』地區內逐步擴張輸出貿易，是否有益，也更爲懷疑。輸出的貨品，內中大都含有日本須用外匯在世界市場購得的原料對『日圓集團』地區的輸出貿易雖見膨脤，但由這些地區的言入，却未見隨着同等膨脤，而日本也未隨着得到同等機會，可佔市的屬地，由實給外國的輸出品所收的外匯，日本和她最新的屬地貿易而發生的入超的增高，現用下列的數字來表明，日本對『日圓集團』非殖民地部分的鐵出，在一九三六年中，每月平均數爲四千一百五十萬元，一九三八年最前八個月中，却巳增至八千九百六十萬元了，（這　輸出雖已增高一倍以上，但在同時期內日本對各外國的輸出，只及前期半數，）但是每月由受一日元集團』補助的非殖民地輸入的平均數，一九三六年只有日金一千九白九十萬元，一九三八年也只有四千九百萬元，日本也未以他具法方自這些新得的地方繼續收到許多外匯『滿洲國』，由『日圓集團』外各地貿易所獲的出超上收進的外匯的凈數，可當買獻給日本的一種禮品的，一九三六年每月爲日金一千三百三十萬元，但在一九三八年最前六個月中『滿洲國』和外國的貿易每月反見入　日金二百萬元，這須由日本撥款抵補的。日本在華北華中或可績得相當數的外匯，日方人員刻在該兩地倚，軍隊的積極轉助，竭力設法搜括中團法幣，去換『聯準』紙幣或日元紙幣，或抵付日本的輸出品。但是中國政府現正實施維持法幣，使牠能够掉換外匯的政策，因此日本所得的利益，確不甚大。法幣今仍在大多數被佔地區佔優越地位，一般人民都不順使牠流入日本人之手，這一點的確是『日元集團』在這些地區所遭的主要導礙。</p>
<p>人們只要日本在和『日圍　圑』中的新土地的實易上佔入超的地位，稍爲思索。便容易了解日本實在不應該歧　對『日圓集團』各處的輸出理由了。她至少不將含有外國原料，成能在世界市場上，　得外匯的各項製造品連往加入『日圓集團』的各地，這些新土地，現在過於把　們照日本內國市場的重要部分看待。在大陸和日本一般，以消　意義籌劃各種取締貿易條例，阻　貨物賣給不能付他種　幣，只能付日圓或倚賴日圓的紙幣的二等主顧，　不但使日本出商大爲棘手，並且熱切提倡中日『合作』的軍人，也大爲沮喪，所以日本現在賣得只有將中國的對第三國出，加以極充分的統制，和沒收內這種貿易所得的外匯，供『日圓集團』應用，才能使日本貿易由新萌芽的貨幣同盟得到種種利益，這些利益將爲勝利的所得品。</p>
<p>日方企圖將全盤毀滅</p>
<p>日本任華　進取途徑，至少目前因爲不能給制中國　對第已國輸出所得的外匯收入，而被阻塞，還有一個更重要的原因，日本在華北行用的新貨幣，不過是一張紙，只能換另一種紙，不能兌現。護明日方企圖大遭失敗，所以日本躊躇不敢照原定計劃，在華　行用同樣的貨幣，而將『日元軍用票』收囘，這種「軍用票』甚至不能在一解放的新中國一作爲法定通貨，絕不能得到日軍槍組所不能及的任何華人的信用。當此中國法幣依然能够掉換外匯之際，凡新貨幣，至少要有目下中國的外匯收入一部分爲後援，才能得到和中國法幣奮鬥，而逐漸廢棄它的同等機會。所以日人在對中華戰爭要到經濟上的勝利到，假使　們能够的話，還有一個得日圈，須得打破：他們因爲不能操有使輸出品流　的中國貨幣，便不能統制中國對第三國的輸出貿易：他們因爲中國法幣固有價値，遠過他們所行用的代替物，便不能制或銷毀中國的『舊幣』；他們因爲在中國法幣還未完全破壞之際，倘要創行一種更佳的代替物，唯一顯明的方法，必須使這種代替物能够自由掉換金元，或金鎊。右目前狀况中，只能用中國物運到外國，才能掉換到手，所以他們要創行比中國法幣更佳的代替物，是辦不到的。日人現用槍刺施於遭種工作，想减少中國物產流往世界市場，不但未能收效，反而鼓勵他們輸出。所以在華建設『日圓集團』，距離完成的地步，還遠者哩。無論今日日本和她鞏固統制的屬咄一方面，跟在華所佔地區另一方面，有什麼經濟上的和財政上的密切關係，這種關係依然完全以日軍野蠻力量爲根據：密切貨幣同盟較精明而更有强制性的力量，尙未眞正實現，兩國間吿成一種『和局』，縱然這種和局允日本統御中國的欲望如願以　，也難望使這些狀况發生，速的變更。</p>
<p>同時，日本目下正用武力將那些經濟政策至少安下基磯，希望「日元集團」的貨幣機構終得平順地，有效地，近乎自動地進行，而使對中國或第三國方面的利益的侵佔，不過分鑼露：且正在準　使華籍屬員用一新中國一名義，實施現代統　外匯的方法，以代目前日本陸海軍官慣行的描暴干涉貿易和產業的手段。一種精紙歧視的官僚制度——如執照，　額，取締條例，捐稅和稅則的如操縱手段，信　放款的條例等等日本已將這一切在她國內和她的屬　中發展成她日已極有成績的最近封建立主義，連同所己給予日本的兩大專利企業，卽（華北華中，開發會社）的大樓，現已悄悄地計謀吿成日本所抱的志　。這不外將中國化爲日圓集團的一個主要部分，像台灣朝鮮　滿洲　」一般；將有用於日本的中國各種物產從事發展；將其他各物或將來可和日本工業發生的競爭，化爲　有；將戰前中國遠大而日見滋畏的自給力，轉爲完全倚賴日本；將中國和日圓集團外的世界彼此　濟的往來。减至適合日本自己需要的程度。但是日本想對中國和奠定已久的泰四利益獲得這種經濟的勝利。前途茫茫，一待還　達到目的，因貨泰西的利益和中國現代的進步，密切結合，已在全國成了個正正當當獨立的單位。卽使日本因爲泰西的抵抗或不能維持中國自已的長期抗戰，總能吿成這經濟的勝利，然日本經濟的問題，要在『大日圓集團」內　得解决，似乎　然毫無把握的。（完）</p>

<p>— 穆欣</p>
<p>【民革社督西通訊】在×人的軍事進攻，受到了最頑强的抵抗的時候，×人便在各處開始他們卑鄙無恥的政治陰謀，用一切欺騙和麻　的宣傳，企圖　分化我們的團結，和民衆對於我們政府的熱烈的擁護，爲了更方便　×寇對我們民衆的剝削和權括，便用金錢收買我國各地　固腐化，漢奸份子、成立傀儡一樣的僞組織、——漢奸政府，根據記者最近調杳訪問，及參攷俘獲的×僞文件研究的結果，特別把山西，察哈　，綏遠三省×僞　奸組織的醜態，吿給各地讀者。</p>
<p>山西的省會太原，是前年（二十六年）十一月八日失守的，在我們的軍隊退出了城後，一批無恥漢奸王八　。便開始了成立僞組織的活動，到十二月廿八日，漢好韓謙和郭象　等，便組織僞『山西省臨時政府籌備委員會」，是日正式着手籌備僞組織。</p>
<p>一直到去年——二十七正的六月二十日，僞，『北京昨時政府』才有命令發來，正式成立僞『山西省公署一，並且同時公佈了僞省署的組織表，和他的人選名單，漢奸報紙，『山西新民』報還出版特刊來『　賀』這一僞組織的成立、</p>
<p>僞組織的上邊放一個最高顧問，作爲僞組靈的『最高發令者』，下邊設一省長，和秘書長，三個參議，並分民政財政，建設，敎育四個廳：外有一個諮議，三個參事。</p>
<p>僞省署的最高　問，是由山西×僞的『太七皇』，太原特務機關長谷穫那華雄担任，祖任省長日的蘇體仁，是媚日擊恥的留日學生。李逆昇培是僞秘書長，參議的角色甲郭象升，韓謙，高步靑來扮演，導民政　長是宋澈，財政廳宋純如，建設廳是張聯魁，漢奸裴潤泉担任敎育廳長，諮講的逆名是張爾續，他們增些敗類的成份，就是些流氓，前淸的「拔貢」，烟酒鬼等些漢奸，高逆步靑，以前曾經担任過山西省銀行的經理，是爲　賄舞弊，被捕下獄，直到七七事變以後，才被保釋出來的一個不要臉的空伙。</p>
<p>僞山西省公署，便是山西僞行政　織的最高領道機關，此外，凡是×人兵力能達到的縣份，便都成立僞縣公署，据我方前逮捕洪洞僞敎育科長李其昌洪稱，一般的各縣×僞組強，共分三科，偽縣公署，維持會，特務機關領導下的一些組織。</p>
<p>此外，便是×人特務機關領導下的幾個東西，有作爲『縣署顧問』的『政治工作隊』，有　問　而股的『經濟工作隊』，城防守衛的警備隊，專作虛僞的欺騙的政治宣傳的『宜撫班』，還有一個『荷葉隊』專修局樑，和一個負資修補道路的『牛道隊』。</p>
<p>×人在各地設立的機關，可謂不少；但是，這些機關，是處在我們游擊隊的包圍當中，很難　揮他的　用到城墻外邊去，卽使是太原的×僞政權，政令的施行也走不出城外十里，在全山西，我們一零五縣中，到處還都有我們的抗日政權吃立着。</p>
<p>因　這些漢奸政府，根本便是×人的傀儡組織，所以×人甚麽時候看着不順眼，或奢使用着不方便，便隨時的予以撤銷或改組，綏遠和察哈爾的偽組織，便是肉了這個理由，最近被×人實行了通盤的改組。</p>
<p>改組以後。　的僞組織，是把綏　與察哈爾連結起來，組成『蒙古聯盟自治政府』，實行了×人心幕中。很久便有的『象古國』的夢想。</p>

<p>— 森然</p>
<p>【北平特訊】九一八事變旣作，三省渝亡，熱河抗戰曇花一現，七年以來，日人在東北四省經營，雖不無成續，但我熱心愛國民衆之懷念祖國，與義勇軍之游擊活動，在在足爲東北不亡之明證。頃有客來自熱河，爲述當地一般現狀，爰特　之，以爲後方之關懷東北情形者吿，</p>
<p>熱河之亡，亡于湯玉　時代之虐政，亡于一部民衆國家觀念之薄弱，直接原因則爲國無防衛，官兵預，當湯氏在熱横征暴歛，民苦　政已久，故×兵一至，湯軍立卽瓦解，其時×實得力於少數奸民嚮導之力爲多。蓋熱河天險，非熟悉地勢者不能爲菌，一部無知民衆之意，尙以×爲救星，初不料其引狼入室，以暴易暴也。比×侵略鐵蹄旣獲得穩定之立足點後，該批民衆乃始漸亡國滋味，痛苦日增，訓至羣起而謀反抗，然已無及。按熱河漢蒙民挨雜處，原轄十六縣，四設治局，現設治局皆升格爲縣，共計廿縣，漢民六百萬，蒙民五十萬，率多　困，生活艱難，所謂官紳富戶及小　之家，不過百分之一二而巳。</p>
<p>熱河民衆之貧困者旣多，故因感×之高壓攘臂而起者頗不乏人，環境與生活使然也。東北義軍自九一八後到　蠶起，而以李杜將軍所部爲其主幹，在熱河者卽屬李將軍第十二軍一部，其中有在晉冀察邊區活動之第八路軍人員，去年由翼東輾轉而入然遼，與第十二軍共負游擊實任，深入民間，掩護亦相當機密，實際活動作戰者雖僅五千人，但潛伏侍機者則不下三萬人。惟×自侵據熱河後，卽利用大險，各口戒備尤嚴，公路網縱横交錯，皆爲瀝靑石子築成，每一村公所卽裝有電話，交通聯絡甚敏捷而便利，因此我游擊隊之活動頗感棘手。第八路軍去秋由冀東經潘家口入熱時，與×轉戰於　察邊境之豐寧一帶，迄無順利之進展者其原因在此。刻熱境我軍均伺伏山林深處，乘機出動，動驟破壞×之交通，並截其輜重運輸汽車，留爲我用。或則化裝入城鎭將×後方糧食倉　焚燬，而避免與×作正面之交綏。×來我走，×退我集，使×疲於奔命而無從捉摸。</p>
<p>熱境游擊隊大半係熱河土著，多長騎射，且性格强悍勇於殺×，熟悉地理，出沒無常，倘能再加訓練，敎以現代戰爭之法，則必將成爲抗×最前綫之勁旅。民間抗×情緒現亦日漸高漲，昔×初據熱河，曾挨戶搜索槍枝，不得私藏，故民間槍械，大半爲×繳去，現民衆抗×皆以白刃與×肉搏，甚或惟刀棍等物攔截×人汽車，其英勇果敢之精神有如此者。</p>
<p>日人侵略東北處心積慮垂數十年，故九一八後卽依其預定計劃，無論經濟方面政治方面均積極推行，頗有成就，此爲不容諱言之事實。七七以來×在華北行動，卽　依樣葫蘆，然而收效絕鮮、其原因蓋以×初陷東北　愚民不知亡國之惨，未嘗亡國奴滋味，懵懵然昏昏然，及見×强暴恣横，××刦掠，萬不痛恨切齒，卽漢奸之流，亦多鑒于東北僞官勢力之日漸削滅，與日人官員之專權騙横，而深自悔又，因此×向之施於東北而能收效者，不復能施用于華北，而民族意識與國家觀念之增高加强，尤爲×我在政治訓練上劣敗優勝之焦點所在。×於軍爲之餘無良好之政治以繼其後，惟事殺戮株連，壓力愈大反抗愈大，熱河——　至東北——在地之民情激昂未始非×之暴虐不仁有以促成之也。</p>
<p>我在熱境之政治工作，雖尙不逮冀晉各地深入，但亦相當成功，各縣均派有聯絡員若干人分負情報及宣傳工作，灌輸抗×思想，加强民間組織。惟在軍事上則因×　交通聯絡後利，尙無宏效。至×方政治工作，所以防我民衆者至嚴且苛，無綸機關大小，均以日人握其實權蓋視傀儡行動。醫如縣政府日人則稱參事官，現改稱副縣長，大權在握牛殺予奪盡隨意所爲。每縣警務局之指導官悉由日人充任，亦與副縣長無異。以下警務局轄警察署五所或七所，每所又各設日指導官二名，劃地方爲若干區，區有公所，卽×所謂『自治機關』是也。</p>
<p>全熱戶口最近已調査竣事，戶口簿分別存於警察署及區公所，人　增减得　時　報，經調査屬實始行登記，出村經宿返囘者亦須報由區公所轉請警察署發給身分證明書，長期外出　須覓連環保證人陳明事由備案，由警察署頒給護照，載明一切限制始許出行，且行必先陳明期限，逾期不歸則保證人及家屬將悉遭拘捕，甚且以「通　』論死罪，其限制之酷與刑罰之苛，民衆皆敢怒而不敢言，銜恨之深，無過於此。</p>
<p>熱境雖無報紙宣傳，但民衆每聞游擊隊在某處活動，莫不欣然色喜，互相傳述消息，而以『中央軍打過來了』爲慰　。卽在×軍高壓下之僞軍偽警，亦多懷此心理，希望戰串能擴展至熱河　有機會反止投誠。因此×在熱對我遊擊隊之「肅淸工作」多不敢派遣僞軍前往，恐防偽軍反正倒戈相向也。刻熱河偽軍爲邢逆士　所部約有萬人，號日一第五路中管區司令部一完全駐防承德。其他外縣駐軍則日治安隊」，實力分散脆弱不値一擊，我遊擊隊因此甚爲得手。×雖傾全力，終難　效。一俟靑　擊起，遊擊隊之活動，當更較積極可斷言也。</p>
<p>×性狐疑，河平民遭無辜逮捕與殺戮者日有所聞，最近因熱河境游擊隊之活躍，曾大舉檢査，各縣知名之士被×無故拘捕者甚多，熱河全境　情騷然，巳呈極度恐怖狀態，漢奸等輩亦感人人自危，忠義之士待機而動，人民自動參加游擊者日　，故今日熱河，殆巳掀起抗×之怒潮矣云。（四月五日）</p>

<p>眞理和正義是不容假借的。</p>
<p>中國的抗日戰爭，是爲保障眞理和正義的戰爭、因此在這戰爭中吸引了成百成千的愛護眞理與正義的　際人士，有共產黨徒，也有基督敎徒，有軍事的技術的專家，也有記者和其他各族各界各種階級的男女。</p>
<p>他們不向日本而向中國跑，而且連日本所有愛護眞　與正義的也跑到中國，如鹿地亘先生等，願爲中國的解放而努力。</p>
<p>中末特萊女士，只是成百成千的願爲中國眞理正義之戰而犧牲服務的人士　的一個而已。然而史女士的過去的努力，已足令全世界。義人士聞　與奮。史女士最近還從東南戰場，就新四軍中戰士的英勇作戰而負傷無人救治的情形，寄函本港衞生　長司在永覺夫人，籲請居住安樂窩的西醫們暫時放下了安樂，去救治千萬爲眞理正義而奮鬥的受傷兵士。史女士大聲呼籲：</p>
<p>中國的西醫生們和外國西　牛們，這些人（中國的戰士），爲着人類文化的生命，不求聞達，不求榮利，不受任何歡　歡送而上前綫去拼命，去死，你們竟漢然不予援助，你們夜間能不爲夢魔所擾嗎？你們對着鏡子不會面紅羞愧嗎？要是這些人打敗了，仿對於你們和孑孫的未來能無恐懼嗎？</p>
<p>我們苟免於砲火寄身於外人勢力之下的中國同胞們！我們中國的醫生護士們！我們有到史女士這篇呼籲，能無有動於衷嗎？我們敢　以無浪熱誠，借用史女士的文句，向大家呼籲：</p>
<p>『請暫時放下你們的無愛，走到中國前綫，在那裏應付各種問題，各種困難，各種痛心的事體，爲正義而奮鬥，料理那爲你們的兒子你們的國家而去死的壯士，不要在國史上留下可恥的標誌啊　』</p>
<p>全世界甚至×國日本內部，所有愛眞理愛正義的男女，都不遠千里的　到中國的戰場上，爲中國的戰七而服務，難道我們中國同胞自已，倒反甘心伈伈俔俔地苟全身家性命於外人勢力之下而恬不知恥嗎？同時。我們要請問，外人的報紙，都已大字刊載史女士及其他正義人士爲中國戰士而呼援的文章，難道我們中國人自己的報紙，倒反漠不關心恬不知恥地把這種正義人道的呼籲文字擲諸字紙簏嗎？</p>
<p>你們不會面　羞愧嗎？</p>
<p>眞理和正義在向你們呼喊！</p>

<p>— 董平</p>
<p>要明白張伯倫的沒有决心，且看他的兩次宣言：『在此時朋內，如發生威脅波蘭獨立之任何行動，波政府認爲必須全力抵抗者，英政府將立卽予波蘭以援助』。『舉凡一切行動，如顯然威脅希臘或羅馬尼亞之獨立，希臘或羅馬尼亞政府認爲必須傾力抵抗者，帝國政府即將認爲與希臘或羅馬尼亞有相援助之信約約』。</p>
<p>這不說得很明白嗎？英、法保證的僅僅是：波、希、羅三國的『獨立」，而且還要　國『政府認爲必須傾力抵抗者』。</p>
<p>後來，法外長龐萊表示，『獨立』之外，『土地完整』也在保證之列。但他仍說：『德如進攻但澤，波蘭傾全力以抗。吾人卽行援波』。但怎樣才算『傾全力以抗』呢？</p>
<p>我們承認，英法宣言，的確打碎了德意的『敲詐侵略』企圖，但，同樣地，却也給德意開了一個方便之門：『外交侵路』。</p>
<p>由於英法宣言的限制德意是武力不『進攻』了，而改用外交的進攻。所以，意匈，意希，德雜，德南，都有談話，甚至美聯社的消息說，德波都有諒解，準備把但澤還德。</p>
<p>如果軸心國家用『外交侵略』，而得到重大的收獲，不知道張伯倫將怎樣再去發個宣言，挽救這個失着。</p>
<p>所以，我們同意阿特里少校的話，這宣言實在太軟弱了。爲什麼如此軟弱，終究，因爲張伯倫的一羣畏懼戰爭。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>上面已經說得很明白，不論民主國家或軸心國家，在心理上，在傳統上，根本都是長懼戰爭的，而還不曾達到决心訴諸武力的時候。現在，我們冉願在外交，軍備，及一般的情勢上，提供兩個壁壘還不能掀開决鬥的理由。</p>
<p>先說軸心國家方面。最顯明的，我們列舉五點</p>
<p>一，我們很明白，凡爾賽和約之後，英，法，美是維持現勢的國家，德，意是企圖打破現勢的國家。但打破現勢的方法太多了，德，意乃避重就輕，捨戰爭而用恫嚇。屢試屢驗，時至今日，因爲民全國家有聯台以武力制止侵略的决心，德，意仍然可以用恫嚇或新的『外交侵略」方式，去當現她們的野心。她們必冒險出諸戰爭。</p>
<p>二，卽令退而言之，民主國家下了抵抗的决心，那麼　德，意恫嚇與外交侵略的詭計，自然不售。但，她們會硬拚嗎？不，决不會。我們相信，如果在一九三五年的時候，德，意也許會由戰爭方式來爭奪土地，現在决不會了。她們巳經增加了很多的土地了。現在的德，意版圖，遠較她們一九一四年還要大，日耳曼的勢力、已開了歷史上的紀元。我們可以說，德，意現在已經到了快可以保守的形勢了。至少，我們相信，德，意是無意把化盡心血　來了大邦土地權益。再給快的在戰爭中送掉。</p>
<p>三，軸家國家的軍力不及民主國家，是德，意不敢冒然一戰的重要理由。這些年來，德，意雖然竭力準備，但限於財力，人力，富源，仍然難有大圖，據一九三就年正月的統計，德，意，日三國的軍力。爲英，法，美，蘇四國五分之四。而尤其富源的太差，不能支持長明戰爭。但，如果要打起來，戰爭一定是長期而耗費的。</p>
<p>四，反共陣線的未能充分發展。使德，意常作後顧之，第一個是日本，雖然簽了反共協定，但，因爲在華戰爭，陷入泥沼之後，最近平沼竟觀顏的說：『日本旣不屬於民主國，也不屬於集權國』，已正式在　德，童的台了。德，意所要求的軍事聯盟，日本也婉言謝絕了。這，令德，意在掀起戰爭之前，不得不略加躊躇的。</p>
<p>五，德，　的新殖民　，　捷克與阿　。尼亞，甚至阿比西亞與奧大利，雖然由希特勒莫索里尼一　風的佔據了，但內在蘊　的，危機重重，自然都須要一番長久的整理，在這項工作未完成之前，德，意是不會亂動的</p>
<p>現在，是民主國家們不戰力理由，我們列舉最明白的三點：</p>
<p>（一）民主國的戰時準備，尙未完成，英，法自戰後是太鬆懈了，由於舉國的歌頌和平，武備廢弛得很利書，兩國現在的第一線軍隊，合起來，還不抵上德國的，最差的，還是空軍，較軸心國家太遠，合起來，還不到德，意的一半，張伯倫，達拉第眼看着倫敦巴黎的大好繁華，安肯眼前吃虧，唯有拖延時日，以待拚命，追趕了。</p>
<p>（二）美國的態度，是與主國家行動的一大指針，羅斯福雖然發了個建議。但那只是徒托空言、沽名釣譽　了，决沒有實力援助民主國的决心。所以，要英法肯挺起胸來作戰，美國是表明十足的態度的。</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯的合作，更是重要，我們知道，英國根深蒂固的傳統政策，是不與蘇聯爲伍，××××××，寧見純粹馳騁於英倫三島，不願見布　雪維克的揚眉，現在，時勢所逼，英蘇進行談判，並且圓滿結束了，但，前途如何，眞的合作怎樣實現，我們還只能期待着看！如果，沒有蘇聯合作，民主國家，是未遠挺不起身來的。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>現在，許多人極力宣揚大戰卽將爆發，說：『第二次世界大戰巳不可避免，何時爆發，只是時間問題而已　。這句話，我們幷不否認，　所謂一時問』到底是幾日，幾月，幾年呢？</p>
<p>我們的意見是：在今年，一九三九年中，歐洲無戰事。（完）</p>

<p>司徒永覺發表談話</p>
<p>據醫務總監、司徒永覺對記者稱、謂管理人非法毆擊難民則有之、惟毆至重傷因而斃命、則事屬子虛、据其調査結果、該事眞相，則因錦田難民營皆屬葵棚、故營中規例、嚴禁吸姻及私自烹物、着恐不愼火災堪虞、致危及營中四千難民生命、則二十年前馬地之火災慘劇、不難重見、在數日前、營中管理人發現某難婦在須風之處烹藥，卽向其阻止幷吿以營中禁例、因是雙方遂起爭執、該管理員一時性起、遂不顧法例、以手杖毆擊該婦之背、事後卽遭當局解除其職位、該婦事後離營、至　頭警署報案、</p>

<p>煎藥何異　拳足交加</p>
<p>難民營中日常兩餐、能裹腹者固有、不能終席者在所難免、惟間有婦女單購買些少鹹魚補助之、或身體不舒、則以湯藥調劑之、然鄕俗中人、大都祟尙國醫、營內旣無中醫藥設備，難民　成費艱辛，出資購用、遠在營外空　地、自行　煮、此乃最正當之舉動、而辦事人則不予方便、見則拳足交加、將藥物具踏破、稍向求免、則棍棒横衝直擅、爲最可憐者，老幼婦孺、意皆受苦、其虐待苛刻者、此其三、</p>

<p>— 育萬</p>
<p>誰道文明的都市裏還夾帶了落後的鄉村？</p>
<p>對照着　——這旣然是一個巍峨燦爛的黃金島，奈何要來一個簡陋頽鄙的鄉村？</p>
<p>——這村，是石峽尾村，本地人叫客家村。在深水埔大埔道旁，一行流綫型的洋房子和別墅的背側；在康莊的柏浦路上，岔分了一條瓦礫滿途的小路；在燈紅酒綠的夜光裏，映露了一堆東斜　倒的人家。</p>
<p>本來香港，九龍，一般地說到『鄉村」大小總算好幾處，銅鑼灣有大坑鄕，靑山道也有客家村，其餘，九龍城內，鑽石山頭，又何嘗不是部落式的農村—然而，這裏——峽尾村，它給人的感想，到底不會如是其簡單和模糊啊！</p>
<p>由於地窄人稠，屋小簷低，前横梗着滿渠汗泥的腐水溝，更由於便溺的充積，猪囚的縱横……使人踏上村頭，便引起了「人間地獄」的觀念。</p>
<p>幾日幾夜的風雨，掃凈了繁華都市的長街—然而，石峽尾村的全部，巳在風風雨雨與，冲覆了多少泥沙，吹折了多少矮栜和低簷—籬芭，他們僅有的短竹，猪欄，他們僅有的枯樁，怕也都不遺細巨地被破壞了—村民們生活的痛苦，在享樂的人看來，他們是什麽似的！</p>
<p>村裏增堆砌砌地，陵陵亂　地，約莫擠下了三百以上的人家。抗戰前這裏祗種花澆菜，養猪養雞的農民，他們日出而作日入而，地向「皇家」租一二畝的『農村地』，蓋搭了木屋和棚寮，勤勤苦苦的去把種花和菜，去養猪和雞，爲了應付日常的伙貧和雜糧，村裏亦不過有一二間『雜貨京菓』小店的。抗戰展開了，國內逃難人多，於是洋房裏擁不了的難民，便開始作哥崙布的探求了，三五個月後，這裏就發現了穿摩登旗袍的如娘；西式家私，本來要擺在西式的房間裏的，然而，搬進這裏來的確也不少。又半年了，由于廣州的淪陷，大批戰區裏的難民，蜂　地逃來了，受過都市洗　的農夫，也得乘機要錢了，於是，村頭裏的牆邊，早也就貼滿了『農村屋招租』的字條。……到現在，則別說　旗袍的姑娘，我們貴幽裏的紳士們，也居然出入于小泥屋裏了。建築家，他們是靠土地找吃的，他們在算盤下產生了一價格』和『價値』的因果，他們便决然地拿了錢到這裏來買平地建木樓。租也可以，賣也可以，他們于一月半月閒已把落後的鄕村造成了幾條街——什麼『永勝里』『康寧里』了。地憑人貴也好，人憑地貴也好，現在的石峽尾村，多少巳有了那擁有十來架衣車的縫衣工場，和做酸枝家私的木店……</p>
<p>然而，夭呀！難民們終竟是走頭無路的。在天高氣爽的秋，縱使風寒物燥的冬，他們或許還能得過且過地蟄居于『猪』『雞』之林，若乎，處春雨迷濛的今日，尤其是近這十天八天來，狂風驟雨的時候，村事頭的氤氳氣息，夾着一陣陣的豬雞的蒸燠臭味；村　的汙渠。汙渠裏人家的洗濯……等到溽　逼人的夏夜，那聚蚊成雷的情景，住在這裏的人，其生命的痛苦，可說全無維擊地裸露于人間地獄中了—</p>
<p>遊覽于九龍牛島的人們，你們偶然地走近了村之街頭，而且適逢着天氣晴和的時節，你們或許會想像到一個世外桃源的鄕村。然而，這大不然的：大都市裏的鄉村，是沒有生氣的。石峽屋的村民，和都市裏溝通的，除了每朝從酒樓茶肆裏整担整組地挑來的飯羹餚層之類的東西而外，還有些什麼呢？</p>

<p>事實吿訴我們：作爲立國之本的文化敎育，是×人所要推毀與破壞的主要對象。自從抗戰爆發之後，國內大學或遭慘炸，或被迫遷移，以致敎授學生輾轉流　，高等敎育之生命頻於危境。要是讓其破壞而無建設，坐視死滅而不求新生，這未始不是國家民族之隱憂。爲救濟失學靑年計，爲促進華僑敎育文化計，爲浩就抗戰建國人材計，南華學院遂應運而生。追溯該校的歷史。</p>
<p>是去年抗戰建國週年紀念之翌日，雷賓南，鍾魯齊，雷通羣三位著名敎育家，假孔聖堂邀請各界人士集會籌議，當時出席參加者計有：任鴻雋，陳衡哲，莊澤宜，黄覺民，陳彬和，傳尙霖，曾友豪，王猷建，等二十八人，討論結果，咸認此時此地，確有設立高等教育機關之必要。復嚴文化敎育界聞人參加發起，協力贊助，因此，從研究而演進爲事實。</p>
<p>創業是艱難的，但是在校董慨捐鉅資，院長鍾魯齋博士名敎授雷通羣等埋頭苦幹之下，該校從去年秋季開學以來，校務進展，已有蒸蒸日上之。勢校舍位于九龍獅子石道之優美大自然中，亦是春風化雨的育材好環境，該院現任董事爲王寵惠，謝冠生，王雲五，曾友豪，丘公冶，丘元榮，丘季平，丘莘，曾養甫，雷沛鴻，龔子宏諸先生。對于校務，都是十分關懷。</p>
<p>現任主要敎職員爲：董事長兼敎授曾友豪，院長鍾魯齋，敎授雷通羣，程經遠，丘華均，黄覺民，李寶，蔡兆齡，林時彥，郭步陶，李惟誠，方希仁等。秘書兼圖書館主任王永戴，他們懂得敎育而辦敎育，努力創業的精神是至可佩服的。</p>
<p>該院現設文，法，商，三科，共十一學系四年畢業，並附設商業，法政，新聞，師範，英文等科專修科，二年畢業。本學期起，又開辦附屬中學，規模　致擴大。</p>
<p>該院又決將正校設於潮梅。以便發展潮汕一帶高等教育，本港方面，作爲分校，使兼途並進。敎育部對於該院之各種設施深表同情，慰勉有嘉。立案手續，聞經已辦妥</p>

<p>在一個放了一張四方木桌、幾把竹　的簡單環境當中、我跟這一位政治首腦、談了好些時、</p>
<p>是一個領導者、他每天都穿上制服、照着辦公時間到辦公廳去主持省務、工作的艱巨、繁忙、如果不是一個很有魄力的人是不容易担當得起的、幾個從前跟他在軍隊裏做事情的朋友吿訴我、統　大軍是比主持省政簡單得多、軍隊的系就是由上　下的一元化的、所以發號施令、都不必像一個省府主席那樣費思　、多斟酌、李主席求治心切、所以、天天都忙着怎樣的刷新人事、調整機構、怎樣把健全的政治制度建立起來、配台抗戰建國的需要、怎樣把新廣東建設起來、以　海內外同胞、同鄕的殷殷期望、這一切、都使他感到比從前在軍隊辛苦得多、可是、他的勇往精神、還是不斷的在邁進着、</p>

<p>四、開發實業</p>
<p>五、整頓交通</p>
<p>（丙）闡揚文化</p>
<p>一、整理教育</p>
<p>二、促進學術</p>
<p>此處、還有『政務硏究會』、『設計委員會』這兩個新組織、目的是羅致人才、集思硏討、以促進全省的政務、政務研究會是由省府各高級官員共同組織、每月開會一次、以檢討過去工作、加速行政效能、　會爲便於研究起見、分爲民政、財政、敎育、建設、保安、地政七組、設計委員會、設政治、經濟、文化、保衛四組、委員人數由十七人至廿九人、由省政府遴選或委派之</p>
<p>還有一件値得重視的事情、就是省政府不久就要實行合署辦公、原定本月十五日開始的、後來因爲籌備不及、略爲展延、合著辦公的主要作用、尙是事權集中、效能可以增加、有點軍事化的意義俘在、</p>
<p>有一點、我想特別提出的、就是政時人員在精神上進步得多、辦公的時間、大家都投射到辦公廳去、洗脫了從前鬆懈、散漫的「無政府」狀態、</p>

<p>狄安娜寳萍的新片、大家都巳知道是『續滿庭芳』、那張片子快就要來中國放映了、但是她繼『續滿庭芳』後、又要拍些什麼呢、每個影迷恐怕都關心着、現據最新消息、她的新片是一部歷史歌唱鉅製、演的是名歌星珍妮琳（Ienny　Linn）的事蹟、而且是用五彩攝製的、試想如玫瑰初放般的寶萍姑娘、在最新的天然五彩中、將更顯得如何的嬌嫩呀、</p>
<p>按珍妮琳是瑞曲人、珠喉嚦嚦、美妙無濤、當時譽滿全球、有「瑞典夜鶯」之稱、我們以前不是個過一張名子呌做『賣野人頭』（The　Mighty　Barunm）的嘴、華雷斯皮雷飾馬戲班鼻祖巴能氏、曾經請珍　琳去美國表演、那張片子中的珍妮琳、是由佛姬妮白露絲飾演的、這是因爲配角的緣故、再以前、葛蘭絲摩亞在米高梅時、亦主演過一部珍妮琳事蹟的影片、片名已記不淸了、總之、這次狄安娜寶萍的演珍妮琳、至少已是第三次了、</p>

<h3 id="c60">公開棒球賽將臨　中華隊人材仍舊　其他各隊實力亦均增強 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>【本報　訊】棒球是一種最精妙又最用腦的運動、惟正因爲它的組織複雜、則例繁多、許多人都看不懂、興趣不大濃厚、如果懂得的、便覺得棒球比任何一項球類競賽更爲可　、</p>
<p>全港公開棒球賽、已定下月六日開始舉行、地點加路連山海軍場、參加的　有六隊、比往年雖未見增加、然因各隊人材濟濟、實力均增加、可卜將來競爭、異常熱烈、將有空前盛况、</p>
<p>參加的計有中華隊、南華會隊、香港棒球會隊、西洋會隊、美艦岷甸華隊、上海啤酒公司隊、</p>
<p>中華隊乃去屆冠軍、全數好手、本屆依舊幼力、惟捕手羅威廉、現在檀杳山、歸來與否、　尙未知、如其歸來、此職仍由他担任、否則以林業補上、刻下擬定陣綫、大致如下、</p>
<p>投手、黄榮俊、捕手、羅威廉或林業、一壘陳倫失、二壘胡正渠、三壘林業、游擊陳方、左翼鍾燦森、中堅、蔡炳芬、右翼、盧家興、後備員、黄國慶、</p>
<p>看上開名單、俱是名將、攻擊防禦、定然利銳堅强、將來與各隊週旋必復露冠軍顏色、</p>
<p>其他各隊、據我所知、都有新手加入、尤堪注意的、是香港會隊的陣容一新、因該隊有新將多人、如哈利斯、勃郞、地蘭尼、凡尼基亞、比西爾、別路等、都是個中斵輪老手、此外、曾在三藩市海豹會任投手之「快球」希査、亦將爲該隊効力、如其手臂無恙、則本屆任何一隊逢戰香港會時、將有遭遇痛擊的可能、</p>
<p>岷隊之實力、去屆已是不錯、但本屆更强横、因該艦有新自美國加入之靑年棒球好手多人、故實力大增、已非往昔可比、此輩中最堪注意者、有投手路爾、及翼將力格萊爾兩人、彼等對防禦方面極爲堅强、惟擊球較差、</p>
<p>去年獲亞軍的西洋會隊、今年陣經仍舊、然各員經驗則大增、彼等快捷之打法、却是可怕、投手一職、將仍由亞代爾斯担任、而以比萊拉爲候補投手、以備不時之需、</p>
<p>上海碑酒公司隊爲今年之新軍、爲本港以前效力他隊之球員所組成、故成績不敢預言、但自個人方面觀之、實力似不弱、隊員中如老將大李安納、小李安納、那沙連、傑曹等、皆爲快捷好手、如肯努力、前途亦有希望、（東郞）</p>

<p>尾場乙組太古戰華南、太古聯絡渙散、華南進取平均、羅華章、卓鴻展、卓國榮、何鴻基、莫敦湘、均有建樹、太古郭英、梁賡昌竭力支持、頗有收獲、惟華爾實力强勁、太古終無若何收效、以廿五比五十七吿敗、</p>

<p>全面抗戰發動後、很明顯擺在我們聞前的、只有兩條路、一條是俯首貼耳、生殺予奪、惟×是從、萬刦不復、暗無天日的死路、一條是奮起圖存、打倒×入、解除束轉、自由平等、光明燦爛的生路、一個人、一個沒有心盡天良的人、相信决不願舍生路而走死路的、</p>
<p>要斷絕死路、打開生路、惟有集中一切、在同一抗戰圖存目標下奮鬥、而能不能達到目的、惟有看奮鬥的程度來判定、目今奮鬥之這千頭萬緒、發動民衆、激起向仇×愾的情緒、開發資源、鞏固經濟的基礎、折衝尊俎、博得世界的援助、敎宵英才、持續國家的命脈、運籌步署、决策於帷幄之中、衝鋒陷陣、殺×於疆場之上、以及爲抗戰而努力的一切、無不都是奮鬥、不過奮鬥之道雖多、歸納起來、無非勞心勞力兩途、換句話說、就是勞精神和鹼力、西諺云、『健全之精神、寓於健全之身體』、而充實的體力、更非健全的身體無從產生、所以要有超越的精神、雄偉的體力來充實一切奮鬥力量、達成抗戰勝利的使命、鍛鍊健全的體格、實爲先决條件</p>

<h3 id="c70">背泳 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 潘業紹</p>
<p>一般泳者多不諳背泳的、細考原因並非以具難學、而以不如其他泳式的活潑暢快、拯救溺者、背泳獲其致用的時機了、捷泳固爲趕赴被溺者所在最速的、把他拖同水邊則以背泳爲泳便、彼此仰臥水中、救援工作易於進行、話不牽涉太廣、學習背泳之初、最　麻繁的、但覺四肢動作特別來得生硬、</p>
<p>背泳的動作也有多種、最敏捷的要算下肢交相向下打水、兩手從頭上跨過、向前入水的這一種、這個泳姿就和捷泳的相像、僅在身體上的方向相反罷了、因爲動作的方向不同、四肢出水入水的姿勢也就發生差異、下肢打水、脚尖得微內向、這樣的足部姿勢就能增加與水相衝的面積、把浮體的力量增强、因此頭部亦能高仰一點、好使手部能够發力撥水的位置適宜些、捷泳的上肢運動起來是向下推往後去、是爬行的動作、而背泳的上肢動作就很　划船的　發動水中的位置相似、却與胸泳上肢動作略有不同、除方向相反外、手足又出水而　入的、不過彼此都向兩旁撥動、也就易使身軀左右擺動、假如其中的一肢所施力量或大或小、又因背泳姿勢是望不見前面的、繼續背　的方向一定斜去、矯正錯誤、倒不算難、留意臂力均勻的運用便得了、</p>
<p>還有一種是雙手同時舉離水面逾過頭部向前分向兩邊插進水裏去、撥向腰側起水、足部推水的動作就如胸泳一樣、所以曾習胸泳的、學習這種動作容易不過、只有雙手路過頭部的時候、臂膊鼓起的水浪要把耳朶、口部、鼻、和眼睛刺衝着、不安之餘、尤碍呼吸、並且繼續運動下去、疲倦不過的、但是、久而久之、所謂困難、卽成過去、</p>
<p>關于背泳轉身的方法、也須研究、按游泳規則所定、背泳到池邊轉身時也和捷泳的一樣、許可隻手觸換池端的、旣觸池邊、立卽乘着身　還在前進中的力量翻轉方向來、這時候　手持看池邊、池壁給雙足抵觸着、面對池邊、猛向後拋、這个姿勢、便於呼吸、也可乘暇把四肢的肌肉休息一下、另有一種轉身法、却以足底力把池壁把身體穿逾水中、然後復出水面上來、</p>
<p>背　的動作也能不大耗力地伸把縣浮健起來、却未能和胸滬的易予持久、爲了泳技的增進、背泳動作　算繁複、值得加意練習、</p>

<h3 id="c72">平衡物價問題 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>（四）高物價與戰時經濟</p>
<p>依一般的說來、物價和國民的購買力是互爲因果的、物價漲、國民收入增加、因之職民購買力也隨之增加、如物價漲過國　購買力水準之上、國民消費必自然縮滅、因之物價勢必隨之下降、至國民購買力相等爲止、但這以生產發達秩序安定爲條件、並日事實上還不能十足現、因爲工資决無與物價同比例上昇、所以高物價只有削弱國民購買力的事實、很少有增强國民購買叻的可能、試看下表、上　工廠工人的均平工資、二十七年僅較二十六年增加一·八％、但此時的工人生活費皆已增加二九·四％、這便是明顯的事實、</p>
<p>上海工人生活費及工資指數比較表</p>
<p>二十六年　二十七年</p>
<p>工人生活費指數（一）　一二四·一一　一六〇·六〇</p>
<p>工廠工人工資指數（二）　一〇〇·〇〇　一〇一·八〇</p>
<p>貨幣購買力（三）　八〇·五七　六二·二七</p>
<p>（註一）規據國際勞工局中國分局編製數字、（二）工資指數、根據經濟統計研究所出版「經濟統計月誌」本年一月號『上海工廠工人每月平均工資表』核算而得、</p>
<p>何况我國的生產、旣異常落後、現在又處於戰事破環一切生產設備的時明、所以物價高漲、一方面是反映貨幣對外價値的跌落、他方面是加强洋貨對我國財富的剝削力量、換句話說、足以促成我國財政、金融、幣制、以及整個國民經濟於潰亡、</p>
<p>從表面上看、買辦資本（專營推銷外貨的商人之類）和準買辦資本（如以洋貨爲原料的生產者、及具製品的販賣者等等）的收益、或許也有部份的增加、從而造成銀行存欵賬面上的景氣、但旣不能補償他財富資本的貨幣價值之指失、更不能補償整個國民財富上的損失、那是顯而易見的、</p>
<p>從事實上看、國內物價的高漲、現已使國民全體的生活感受酷辣的威脅、這種威脅不消滅、甚至再擴大、結果便有動搖整個社會治安的危險、更危險的將使戰爭的經濟甚礎直接受其搖撼、最近英國曾款中國、協同平衡外匯、如果不設政治意義、而分　其經濟意義時、則誰都曉得『在維持他對華輸出的商品市場』、換句話說、只因中國的物價、業已超過一股購買力水準、使他們在華商品的市場、在日方的暴力阻礙之外、復寧立下一大阻礙、平衡中國的匯率卽所以防止中國的進口物價之續漲罷了、</p>
<p>而且我們重視這個問題的理由、與其說是由於現在的必國、毋寧說是爲了未來、不能不先籌「防微杜籲」之計、因爲當前物價飛漲的主因、旣然由於戰事影響、那宋在戰事尙無結束希望的今後、也就是在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後、勢必還有無限沸騰的危險</p>
<p>（五）國府平衡物價的對策</p>
<p>國府對於戰時的物價、早有統制决心、只因這統制、在經濟組織極周密的歐美各國、尙未脫離　試階段、德國『適正價格制度』、雖受世人讚道、但在經濟組織像一盤散沙的中國、實無摹倣餘　、惟事實上旣已不容長此放任而　若能把物價中的投機因素除、就可平衡心、便可迎刃而解、所以最近終於分令各省市政府、分別組織平衡物價委員會、與各省銀行及地方銀行等通力合作、實行乎衡人民日常必需品的價格、並規定平價標準三種（一）凡物品之生產及運銷成本、受嚴事影響或影響甚微者、以戰前三年或一年之半均價爲準、（二）凡物品之生產及運銷成本、受戰事影響者、以其在戰後之成本再加相當之利潤為標準、（三）凡物品之成本不易計算者、以其經營所需之資本總額、再加相當之利潤爲標準、並規定平衡物價之物品以日用必需品爲限、</p>
<p>平衡物價委員會　組織、係由地方政府及存銀行或地方銀行、曁商會同業公會等共同組織、對於工廠商號或私人囤積大　日用必需品、得由會呈請地方主管官署依評定的格强制其出售、並規定違反左列各欵意圖投機操縱的人、得依照農礦工商管理條例向法院檢舉之、（一）同業間互爲買賣　量、不得超過個子貨現量、（二）非經營日用必需品之同業、不得互爲買賣市場上之朋貨、（三）買賣日用必需品、不得設立交易所市塲、</p>
<p>但在全個經濟上、迄今仍占重大地位的上海、又是投機最然、物價飛漲最快的地方、却已不幸包圍在淪陷區裏、政治力量、已不　發生　極作用、要不是由民間出而自治、簡直　從行、所以上海市民能否解除物價上的不當削和酷陳的壓迫、只在看各業袖能否出力而支持和努力這點、</p>

<h3 id="c74">馬伕王阿福 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 金在鎔</p>
<p>我們住的院子外面就是馬號，裏面有着許多馬佚之中的一個叫做王阿福。</p>
<p>他矮矮的紫。的臉皮，三十幾歲了。但是眉毛總是打結的，像有不可解的心事一般。舉動很拘謹。說話的時候，總是帶着過份的謙恭，處處發現他的農民本色，不像個「老總」。</p>
<p>經常穿着那套灰棉軍衣綁腿也打得不合式樣，相子有時斜帶着，他什麽都沒有，只有一條小，那小狗是日本種，我們攻擊張店的時候一個弟兄俘來的，他要了過來。，他對于那小狗很奇怪的。有的時候很愛護它，不許別人去摸一摸，但有的時候，却毫不客氣的把它打，打到它汪汪亂呌，然而它的主人却露着兩排黄牙齒在獰笑。</p>
<p>邢小狗常常跑進我們院子里來的，他便會走進來要狗。但是一班勒務的機會來了。一個促任他的小狗，另外幾個便把他們圍住，要他唱：『你唱；唱呀老王！』　亂的喧聲，和着那小狗的汪汪亂叫。他顯然有些窘態，然而，人們看到他的狼狽，却沒有寄予同情，反而更上緊的迫着『唱；你唱呀』更大聲的毫無忌憚的譁笑着，於是我們也出來看這一慕快要演到最精采的戲。他要邏延一些時候，但是看到這个遲延幷沒有效果的時候；便不得不唱，然當他站在天井里準備唱的時候，人們又提出更苛刻的要求了。『要扭，你的屁投，不扭不成』。同時人羣中又會有一个把自己的手帕拿出來，遞給他，他是沒有理出不接受這個要求的，祇好接過手帕，在天井里一扭一扭地尖着喉唱起來。</p>
<p>接着『奴家本住保定府…』悲凉的調子，一直唱下去，臉的顏色也逐　的變了，眼眶裏貯滿了淚水，到最後，聲昔嘶啞了，淚也流下來了，人們才滿足地放了小狗，讓他出去。然而等一會是那日本種的小狗倒霉，汪汪的亂吠聲傳到我的耳朵裏，子是我們又　得王阿福在打那小狗了。</p>
<p>這樣的事，我看到了三四次，同我很情他而不同意勒務們一樣的捉弄，但我却不淸楚他爲什麽常常憂愁，常常唱那悲哀的歌，和常常打那日本種的小狗。</p>
<p>是一個刮風的日子，天井里剛才又演過那一齣戲。我再也忍不任了。把一個勤務叫進屋里來，吿訴他以後不要這樣。他答應以後又說：『阿福也可憐……』顯然，他是知起道這個底細的。我追問一下，他給我講了如下的一段故事：</p>
<p>『金先生，你不要看小了王阿福，他本來是一個大財東呢？當日本鬼子打進保定之前，他還有一片田莊，幾頃地，好些家當的人。他有老婆和妹子。我們　軍保定的時候，我曾會過他，他就住在城南的一个鄕　。但是，他却打錯了主意，咱們叫他捐錢，也不捐，叫他傲些什麽，他也不做。</p>
<p>『我們軍隊退出保定的時候，人們都走散了。我和師長走得最後，却看到他家裏蒸着雪白的滿頭，還宰了一頭大豬，我想他搗　麽鬼呢？誰曉得他却準備接日本××呵！</p>
<p>『××們到了，可是並沒有領他　個盛惠，猪據說猪是吃了的。但滿頭却被蹭了稀爛，他的老婆給日本鬼子看中，馬上要帶來走，然而，他怎肯讓日本鬼子把他婆拉去呢？于是打起來了。皇軍對于一个手無寸鐵的中國人，是容易制服的。但事軍對于『賽姑』（日語性交）的興趣似乎比殺人大，所以對阿福做了一個文明的舉動，把　綁在一把木梯上，然後把他的老婆擁上炕去。　一个，兩个，三個……。也許許當時他閉着眼睛（據說王阿福當待確是閉着眼睛）但他可以淸楚地聽到他老娑的掙扎。被悶住的叫喊聲音，他也能淸楚，到上炕的鬼子有六七个……</p>
<p>「深夜了房子是寂靜的，王阿福終於連人帶梯倒在地下，到他冉醒來的時候，發覺另外一個皇軍解他的綁這个皇軍並非特別慈善，大約是曉得他是大財東，所以要他指示　金的地方，然而金沒有找到，他的妹子倒被找出來了。兩枝冰冷的槍剌抵住他，而令他自已的眼睛看到他的妹妹被一個，兩個，三個的皇軍爬上身去。</p>
<p>『他幾次想反抗，可是冰冷的槍刺抵住地的胸膛，一動也不敢動。然而做夢也想不到，在冰冷的槍刺壓迫之下，最後和昏死在地上的妹妹『賽姑』的，就是他自己啊！</p>
<p>『他幾乎瘋狂了。在挨了皇軍無數槍　之後，他還沒有死，就和難民一同西來。</p>
<p>『在太原失守之前，我們部隊到了太原。難民堆中發現了他，他沒有給我嘲笑的機會，就抱住我哭一場，吿訴以上的經歷……』</p>
<p>『於是，他就留在這裏當馬伕』，我揷進了這一句，勤務同意我的話，同時也就出去了。我完全明白他爲什麼老是鎖着眉頭：唱那樣凄凉的歌，和常常打那日本種的小狗。</p>
<p>在那些滅絕人性的野獸踏進我們的國土以後，所到的地方，都演着這樣的故事，千千萬萬的人們，都受到魔難。王阿福的遭遇，不過許多平凡的故事中之一件而已！但這是民族的　辱，我們是不能忘記這些平凡的故事的。</p>
<p>爲着制止那些平凡的故事在各地不絕的開演，我們的戰士正舉起維護止義的旗幟來。我希望不久的將來，在隔着海的東方，也舉起同樣的旗幟，這是我寄與島國的正義與和平而奮鬥的人們的祝福他們的雙肩，也負着制止那些平凡的故事上演的責任呵！</p>

<p>— 啓明</p>
<p>天下着雨，很討厭！但是我知道雨是會住的，只要風一轉向；太陽就會出來的。</p>
<p>我生着病，很痛苦！但是我知道是會愈的，只要我求衛生，不久我就可以恢復健康，快樂地做人。</p>
<p>國家安到了欺侮，很艱難！但是我知道欺侮是會過去的，只要我們一致抵抗，奮力建國，不久我們就可以有一個講光明燦爛的中華民國。</p>
<p>天下凡事，宇宙萬物，都有一定的條理，一定的軌道，失條理爲戰亂，出軌道爲禍害。不能說絕對不會有混亂與禍害，然而這畢竟是暫時的。條理與軌道，終將萬古常存，永遠不滅。暫時與永恒比較起來，算得什麼！</p>
<p>我們看，遠遠地看，在致雨的密雲的背後。不是依然有太陽在照耀　麽？在呻吟宛轉的身體的隱處，不是依然有戰全的體魄在支持着麽？亦分崩離析的國家的深處，不是依然有雄渾浩瀚的國魂在振作着麽？我們的希望不是徒然的，實現之期更不是遙遠的！</p>
<p>我們努力吧，旣不要失望，更不要心焦，一切的不串，就不過如惡夢一般，不久就會消滅得無影無踪，當清晨的光明來到的時候！</p>
<h3 id="c76">領袖崇拜論 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 白樓</p>
<p>好像有人這樣　過，每一個靑年。在心目中應該有個宗拜的中心人物，我們平常總常　說某人是個有思想的人物，其實凡是人都有思想的活動，所以特別指出某人係有思想的人物，實際上就是說某人的思想是有組織的，並不是一般人所共有的散漫的思想。</p>
<p>一個人的思想發展到有　織化，系統化，固然得經過思想上的種種演展，經騐，學識的漸次充實，但這里必然有個不可或缺的要素，人物崇拜。不過並非是偶象式的人物崇拜，而是理智的科學的人物崇拜。</p>
<p>一個人的思想如果趨向組織化，他的思想發展過程無論怎樣的曲綫形，必定有一定程度的與型，而决定這種定型的，就是領導其思想向一定方向展開去的某一人，這某一人雖在一開始時並不存在于我們的思想之中，但思想發展至一定程度時，這樣的人物就會在我們心目中出現，隨思想的進展而進展，我們對于這某一個人的信心逐爾深刻，終至對之發生崇拜心理，惟有思想的演展到了這樣的一個階段，我們的信心才有一定的歸宿，也惟有在思想過程上得來的人物崇拜，才配稱科學的人物崇拜。</p>
<p>有些人很反對英雄崇拜觀念，這種人的觀點偏重於時勢造英雄的說法，而漠視了個人在歷史上的作用。一個人的所以成爲　人，成爲某些羣衆的崇拜對象，固然由於此人的種種環境决定，但主要還是這人的性格能綜合他時代環境的精華於一身，而將之具體化于他的生活及思想方式中，而成偉人。英雄成大衆欽仰的中心，其原因就在這里，　袖的所以不同於一般芸芸衆生，就是他能全動地把握環境且運用之。雖然他的這樣還得由於羣衆的推動。但這種推動力的决定點，還　集中於他的一身，領袖和羣衆力是一種有機的構成，彼此不能分離。</p>
<p>也許有人認爲一般羣衆英雄崇拜，是偶象形成崇拜他們並沒有經過思想上的認識進程。但我們認爲一般羣衆是　現實生活上直覺去認識他們的領袖的。他們從現實生活上認識誰是眞止爲他們謀福利，誰是眞正指導着他們生活的領袖。因此他們的英雄崇拜的形式，雖然近乎偶象式的，但實際上却是出發自現實生活。有時一個虛僞的領袖雖也能一時受羣眾盲目擁護——如在法西斯各國的情形——世不久在現實生活上他們就能認識領袖的眞面自，而加以推翻。</p>
<p>最近讀了董顯光的蔣介石論，又讀到了一篇列寗的傳記，我的心中就不禁起西安事變前後民衆的如痴如狂的感情，同時想像起列寗墓前四季不絕　　瞻仰遺容的蘇聯民衆。蘇聯的得有今日那樣的强盛，中國得能完成今日那樣的偉大的統一，同，心協力共赴抗戰，我們是不能小視了英雄崇拜，領袖崇拜的意義的。</p>
<p>爲了充實自己的思想，爲了定型自己的人格，我們在自己心目中均應存在一個崇仰　中心人物。這不獨能充實我們的止義的信心，且能時時在精鄕上　我們不少慰藉。</p>
<h3 id="c77">鄕下人（續） <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 綠</p>
<p>黄衣人要休息，由郭老二領入了最大的酒店黄隆源。主人黄冠三和家屬，連忙從後門裏逃了出去，只剩兩個年老的夥計承應着，扛出了兩罐酒，請價些異邦「貴客」喝。</p>
<p>一時之間，鎭上年輕的男女，逃得一個都　有　所剩下來的，就只有年老的和年幼的。因爲他們受　的教訓太多，早巳知道應該怎樣自處了。</p>
<p>天已傍晚了，當然可以囘去了，而且更不能不囘去了，於是踉蹌的脚步。載着醉　醺的黄衣人，走出了黃隆源。</p>
<p>郭老二又向領隊的獻計了，說：就這樣回去，未免給「匪徒」笑話，也應該給他們一些厲害。領隊的聽從了他，就辦了這種兩件事：</p>
<p>第一放火燒，就從黄隆源燒起。燒時，郭老二對他的老幼鄭串演說着。</p>
<p>—你們包庇「匪徒」，所以給你們懲節。以後再是這樣，殺個義犬不留！</p>
<p>第二，由郭老二執筆，寫了一張似通非通的字條，貼在街中的橋柱上，大意是說：</p>
<p>……我們已經下鄉了，你們躱到那裏去了！有種的走出來！……</p>
<p>他們任幕色蒼茫中，平安地囘到了城裏，大家都呼了一口輕　的氣。郭老二大受司令的獎勵，說他辦事耽週到而又能幹，馬上就提拔他鐵警察局長」。</p>
<p>郭老二的得意是可想而知的。</p>
<p>明天早上，郭老二按着平常的習，到慣「縣知　署」西首永春茶館喝茶並吃早點。他爲了心頭　興，面上更是喜氣揚揚，一坐下去，就向走堂的　及鄰座的人，說了許多許多話，歌頌他主子的「德政」，並發表他榮任「警察局長」後的大政方針。　在他發表宏論的時候，外面走了一個人，看見他，便　下身去，用熱烈的口吻對他說：</p>
<p>—郭局長，外面有人要拜託你老人家一件事，請你出去見見。</p>
<p>郭老二向那人一看，似乎是認得的隣里，可是名字却想不起來。</p>
<p>—不好呌他進來麽？</p>
<p>說時，他的面上便有些不好　的樣子。</p>
<p>那人又凑前一步，咬着他的耳朶。</p>
<p>來人有機密事，假使郭局長帮了忙，有一些孝敬，所以不便在這裏　。</p>
<p>郭老二一聽有人孝敬，面色便科緩下來，立起身着來人出法。</p>
<p>果然，茶館門口已經有一個人候在那裏，他一看見郭老二出來，就迎上一步，將手向上一揚，說：</p>
<p>—送郭局長歸犬—</p>
<p>同時，又是拍的一聲，從那揚起的手裏發出，郭老二便向後倒了下去，眉心間流一股血流，流得滿面，流得滿地。</p>
<p>茶館裏的人都向外跑，向四面跑，那來　郭老二出去以及揚手的人，也夾在他們裏面跑，沒有多久，誰也不曉得他們，這兩個人，跑到那裏去了。</p>
<p>「警察」來了，在郭老二的胸前又拾起了一張字，上面寫著：</p>
<p>……咱們進城來是撲滅這些爲虎作倀的漢奸的……</p>
<p>接着號　閉城，逐戶搜査鬧馬仰人翻，鷄犬不寗，結果，就只閙在城圏裏，而且是，鴻飛冥冥，弋人何慕！』　（完）</p>

<p>『如果不是自殺，有人傷害自已的嗎？如果不是你傷的，是我自己傷的嗎？』</p>
<p>『很重嗎？』</p>
<p>他沉默地扯出自已被血染紅了的襯衣之領，給她看，她望了一下，又望着他的臉色說：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Current Situation of the War of Resistance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The current overall situation of the War of Resistance presents an extremely optimistic outlook, with counter-offensives on all fronts and frequent reports of victories. We compatriots who have escaped the flames of war and are residing overseas should feel greatly excited in addition to our expectations!</p>
<p>The most important factor that we cannot ignore regarding the recent frequent victories on all fronts is the bloody and arduous struggle of our soldiers and civilians on all fronts and in the occupied areas. This is why, when we hear the news and are excited, we should solemnly pay our highest national respect to these brave warriors. However, at the same time, we should also understand that the reason why the thousands of soldiers on the front lines and behind enemy lines have been able to fight hard and win is threefold: first, it is due to the exposure of the conspiracies of Wang Jingwei and others; second, it is due to the supreme leader and the central government's adherence to the national policy of unity and resistance; and third, it is due to the unanimous support of the government and leader by the people of the whole country, and their vehement opposition to "anti-communist peace" and other traitorous words and deeds. Because of these three factors, the thousands of soldiers on the front lines and behind enemy lines are able to strengthen their confidence in final victory, and are able to move forward bravely and swear to kill the enemy; because of these three factors, international public opinion and friendly governments and peoples are able to increase their confidence in sympathizing with and respecting China, and are able to accelerate their steps to aid China and restrain Japan.</p>
<p>However, the current victories of the counter-offensives on all fronts are not yet the decisive victory for the entire War of Resistance. The setbacks suffered by the enemy on various fronts do not represent the total collapse of the enemy's army. According to generally reliable estimates, when this political conspiracy is newly frustrated, the enemy will certainly have new military adventures to supplement the political conspiracy and implement new offensive strategies. The enemy has been actively preparing for this new military adventure since the capture of Nanchang: although our resolute launch of counter-offensives on all fronts has caused the enemy's preparations to suffer a major blow, when the enemy's combat effectiveness has not yet suffered a fatal blow, and international sanctions and internal revolution have not yet developed to the point where they cannot fight, the enemy will not only not withdraw its troops, but will also intensify its speculative steps! The recent news of the emergency situation in Fuzhou and Shantou, although actually an attempt by the enemy to relieve the siege of Guangzhou, does not mean that the enemy does not want to seize new strongholds in order to plan to support its operations on the Yuehan Railway and in southern Guangdong, and to achieve its dream of strengthening its occupied areas in the southeast. From the perspective of China's War of Resistance, we have now reached a turning point in the entire situation after more than twenty months of arduous fighting! We have reached the point of turning from inferiority and defeat to superiority and victory!</p>
<p>Although the current counter-offensives on all fronts are not yet the comprehensive general counter-offensive to drive out the Japanese enemy; even though the current situation on all fronts still has the possibility of suffering even greater dangers; but only from the current development of our army's victories and the intensification of the enemy's difficulties, we can increase our greater confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance! Our current task, although not yet to launch a comprehensive general counter-offensive, drive the Japanese enemy out of China, and gradually recover lost territory, is to concentrate all our strength to maintain the dominant position that has been or is about to be achieved on all fronts, and to develop this dominant situation with all our strength, to combat the enemy's new and greater military adventures, to prepare for a comprehensive general counter-offensive, and to meet the final victory. In order to achieve this overall task, we must support and develop the counter-offensives on the front lines and behind enemy lines in military terms: in recent days, we have repeatedly recovered Gaoan and Tongshan, and rushed into Wuning in the central battlefield, preventing the enemy's army from advancing towards Changsha; in the southern battlefield, we have repeatedly recovered Zengcheng, Conghua, Xinhui, and other counties, preventing the enemy's army from spying on Guangdong and Guangxi; in the northern and eastern battlefields, we have respectively attacked Kaifeng, Xinyang, Xuzhou, Baoding, Beiping, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and various places in the Lianghuai River Basin, containing the enemy's army in North China and East China from reinforcing Yuehan and South China; therefore, we must currently help the government enhance the combat effectiveness of the front lines and develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines from both material and spiritual aspects, maintain and expand the offensive on various battlefields, and prevent the enemy's new offensive. At the same time, we must also work hard politically and diplomatically; politically, we must support the central government and the supreme leader, consolidate national unity, severely punish those who surrender to the enemy and betray the country, thoroughly eliminate anti-communist and peaceful words and actions that violate the War of Resistance and national construction, and promote the National Spiritual Mobilization as the current central task: diplomatically, we must adapt to the international anti-aggression front movement, intensify international propaganda and national diplomatic movement, in order to demand that the United States stop transporting military supplies to Japan and other practical work, expand the aid-China and restrain-Japan movement, and strive for more and greater foreign aid. We must fulfill this task in order to maintain and develop the current victory, and to realize the comprehensive general counter-offensive ahead of schedule, drive the enemy out of China, and complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Current State of Social Education in Shanghai <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— A．N.</p>
<p>Social education is extremely broad in scope. Shanghai, as China's largest city with a population of over three million, has a particularly developed social enterprise sector to meet the needs of the environment. In addition to government funding, there are also many private initiatives. However, after the start of the War of Resistance, most of the government-run institutions were in the occupied war zones, and the few that were not in the occupied war zones were also cut off from funding sources. They have been announced to be suspended. To date, those that are still in operation are privately-owned, and their educational targets are limited to citizens of the concessions. Compared with the pre-war situation, it is truly a drastic change. Here is an overview of the government-run enterprises that fell into the hands of the Japanese army and those that were suspended before the war.</p>
<p>1.  People's Education Center: The Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center was originally located on South Wenmiao Road. It was a large-scale and well-developed institution with various affiliated projects that were handled with great success. It was the most complete and well-established implementation agency for social education in the city. It fell into the occupied war zone after the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>2.  Libraries: There were originally three municipal libraries, one being the Shanghai Municipal Library in the city center, one being the municipal library affiliated to the People's Education Center, and one being the circulating library in Yimiao. Among the three, the municipal library was the largest in scale and the newest in construction. After the war, it was either destroyed by fire or used by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>3.  Museum: Located in the city center, the architecture was magnificent and the content was quite substantial. After the outbreak of the war, except for a few treasures that were moved to a safe area, the rest were lost. The grand palace-style building was forcibly occupied by the puppet municipal government.</p>
<p>4.  Stadiums: The largest in scale was the Shanghai Municipal Stadium. The magnificence of its architecture was unmatched in the Far East. In addition, there was the Municipal First Stadium, located on Daji Road in South Shanghai, which was smaller in scale. As for the Shangyi Stadium, it was scattered in various towns and villages and was jointly managed by local schools. After the war, all of them fell. Some of the buildings in the Municipal Stadium were destroyed by artillery fire, and it has recently been occupied by the Japanese army as a barracks.</p>
<p>5.  Zoo: Located on Wenchao Road in South Shanghai, opposite the People's Education Center. The various animals that were raised, except for a portion that was moved to Gujiatai Park for public exhibition, were all killed.</p>
<p>6.  Botanical Garden: Located on Longhua Road in South Shanghai. Before the war, it had been transferred to the Municipal Garden Bureau. It was located in a quiet and secluded environment. There were thousands of varieties of rare flowers and exotic plants. After the war, it all fell into the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>7.  People's Reading Rooms: Scattered in various municipal towns, there were no less than several hundred places. Before the war, the Social Bureau designated various schools to run them, either posting the original newspapers or adapting them into wall newspapers. After the war, they were all eliminated with the closure of the schools.</p>
<p>8.  Literacy Schools: Shanghai began large-scale literacy education in July 1935, and held six sessions in succession until June 1937, each session lasting four months. The implementation plan included two major parts, one was literacy education and the other was civic education. The specific goals were the cultivation of national morality, the learning of simple characters, the transmission of common language, the improvement of people's lives, the cultivation of democratic awareness, and the training of productive capacity. After two years of operation, great achievements were made. A total of 317,526 people in the city had received literacy education. Taking the last session before the war, the sixth session, as an example, there were still 91 literacy schools in the city, with a total of 368 classes, and 22,262 students enrolled. According to coordinated statistics, the number of illiterate people in the city by the end of the pre-war period was only 309,334, which was more than half less than before the literacy education was carried out. If time could be allowed, it would not be difficult to eliminate them all. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, this great undertaking has been suspended, which can be said to be the greatest loss in Shanghai's social education.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned social education enterprises were all run by government agencies before the war, and have all been suspended after the war, with none existing. In addition, there are some enterprises that were government-run in the past, but a part of them were able to relocate and recover. The existing social education enterprises are mostly privately-owned or newly emerging after the war, and are also described below.</p>
<p>1.  People's Schools</p>
<p>Although the People's Schools were government-run in the past and were all scattered in the countryside, since the fall of Shanghai, some of the original teachers, recognizing the importance of people's education, have relocated to the concessions to reopen schools, but the number is much smaller than before, with only about fourteen or fifteen levels. The funding is also very limited, so book and miscellaneous fees are also charged to supplement the funding. The implementation methods have also been uniformly stipulated. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Purpose: In accordance with the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation plan, to provide elderly out-of-school people with simple knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>B. School buildings and equipment: The principle is to borrow ordinary school buildings.</p>
<p>C. Students: Both men and women are accepted, and may be set up separately if necessary, but only those between the ages of sixteen and forty are accepted.</p>
<p>D. Period: Each period is six months, and education is provided for one hour per day.</p>
<p>E. Level: Divided into primary and advanced levels. The primary level is equivalent to the first grade of primary school, and the advanced level is equivalent to the third grade of primary school. A combined class system may be adopted.</p>
<p>F. Subjects and hours: Chinese language: primary level accounts for 66% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 50%. Arithmetic: primary level accounts for 12% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 10%. Civic training: primary level accounts for 14% of the total time, advanced level accounts for 8%. Music and physical education: primary and advanced levels each account for 8% of the total time. General knowledge and simple occupation: primary level is combined with other subjects, advanced level each accounts for 12%.</p>
<p>G. Teaching materials: In addition to self-edited materials, literacy textbooks published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and the Commercial Press can be used. Short-term primary school textbooks, Lao Shao Tong, and people's readings, etc., are selected by the teachers within this range with reference to the students' level.</p>
<p>2.  Tutorial Schools</p>
<p>In the past year, tutorial schools in Shanghai, established by private individuals, have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, reaching more than 200 schools with about 60,000 students. The nature of each school can be roughly divided into two types: general education and vocational education. The general education provided focuses on supplementing language, mathematics, and general knowledge. The so-called vocational education covers almost all sectors of the vocational world. The reasons for the particularly developed after the war are nothing more than three: first, the high desire for knowledge among the staff of the business community; second, the change of direction of students in ordinary schools who are unable to read due to the impact of the war; and another reason is the widespread decline in the economic strength of the people, who are unable to bear the cost of ordinary education for their children, and send them to tutorial schools, hoping to acquire a skill in a short period of time to make a living. With these three factors, tutorial schools have been able to flourish for a time, but in terms of quality, they may still not be able to fully satisfy people.</p>
<p>3.  Street Children Education</p>
<p>Street children education is the newest product of adapting to the needs of the environment after the war. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai and its fall as an isolated island, refugees have gathered in the special zone, and vagrant children are walking the streets everywhere. People with a passion for education believe that there is a need for relief, so they raised funds to organize the Shanghai Street Children Education Association to be responsible for the operation. To date, 30 street children schools have been established, with a total of 50 levels, educating more than 4,000 children. All educational activities are different from schools, and the teaching materials are also formulated by the teachers themselves according to the "principles" stipulated by the Street Children Education Association. The teaching hours are also based on the convenience of the street children. The school buildings are completely borrowed from public places, such as temples and ancestral halls, but school buildings or civilian houses are also borrowed when necessary. The implementation points of this new enterprise are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. Educational purpose: To help vagrant out-of-school children between the ages of six and fifteen to receive appropriate education, so that they can be healthy in body and mind, and acquire basic knowledge and skills to adapt to real life.</p>
<p>B. Educational methods: 1. Teaching aspects: gatherings, group work, visits, individual guidance, etc.</p>
<p>2.  Nurturing aspects: Providing medical treatment, correction, and assistance to injured children in their daily lives, and improving their production methods, or introducing vocational training.</p>
<p>C. Implementation steps: 1. Register street children. 2. Guide teachers. 3. Contact educational venues. 4. Physical examination. 5. Stipulate educational hours. 6. Send staff to guide.</p>
<p>D. Teaching schedule: 1. Teacher preparation. 2. Street children gather. 3. Cleanliness inspection. 4. Daily meeting - street children's songs or reports on current affairs knowledge and spiritual talks. 5. Special teaching activities for the whole class or in groups, such as Chinese language, arithmetic, social design, and performance. 6. Singing and games and sports. 7. Group meeting - presided over by the group leader to discuss group affairs and progress.</p>
<p>4.  Refugee Education</p>
<p>Refugee education, as the name suggests, is also a new enterprise after the war. When the war broke out in Shanghai, refugees from the surrounding suburbs gathered in the special zone. Relief centers were established one after another, and were separately organized by the International Relief Committee, the Charity Group United Relief Association, the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, the Refugee Relief Branch, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and various hometown associations and public organizations. At most, there were more than 220 relief centers. The educational methods were independent of each other and lacked standards. The educational affairs were concurrently handled by the managers of each center, and the methods were also different. Later, the organizers of each center, recognizing the importance of refugee education, successively set up training groups or education groups to preside over the educational affairs of each center under their jurisdiction, but still only focused on the children's part. Until the International Committee of the Red Cross took over the responsibility of providing food for each center, an education committee was set up to uniformly preside over the refugee education in the city, and the facilities and facilities were put on the right track. At most, the number of refugees receiving education reached 149,700. As for the content of the implementation, refugee children aged six to sixteen received children's education, divided into Chinese language, arithmetic, general knowledge, singing, physical education and other subjects. Chinese language, arithmetic and general knowledge were basic subjects and must be educated. Singing and physical education depended on the equipment, talents and environment of each center. The education time was at most 22 hours per week. Refugees over the age of sixteen received adult education, divided into literacy, spiritual training, lectures, storytelling, movies, fitness exercises, etc., with literacy education as the main focus and lectures and storytelling as supplements. The education time was at least 21 hours per week and at most 26 hours per week. Refugees who had the ability to live or were more intelligent were given vocational education, divided into vocational training and production education. Vocational training was given to them with vocational knowledge and skills, and production education was given to them with the technology of various handicraft production. There are now 22 types of handicraft production workshops, such as embroidery, sewing, carpentry, weaving, etc., and products have been launched for sale. If it can be maintained and promoted spiritually, it will not be difficult to transform the consuming refugees into producers.</p>
<p>5.  Lane Education</p>
<p>The so-called lane education is actually equivalent to the past itinerant education, but its itinerant range is based on the lane as a unit. Its implementation method is very mobile. Any lane with no schools nearby but a large population is its educational venue. The school buildings are mostly borrowed from public places or the remaining houses of enthusiastic educators. The equipment is very simple. Except for those necessary for education, the rest are provided by the students voluntarily, and even the tables and chairs are brought voluntarily. The content of education focuses on basic training, especially on the knowledge and skills of daily life and the inculcation of national concepts and national consciousness. Since the recipients are children, it seems that they can be classified into the scope of school education, but since the implementation method is very different from school education, it is actually a kind of social education, because the target of social education is not limited to children. At present, there are about 430 people in the city who are receiving this lane education, divided into seven levels and scattered in seven places. When the number of out-of-school children in each place decreases, they will be moved to other lanes for education. It is also a product of adapting to the actual needs after the war.</p>
<p>6.  Newspaper Boy Education</p>
<p>Shanghai is a gathering place for the newspaper industry. There are thousands of children who rely on selling newspapers for a living. These children call out the important news published in various newspapers every day, running around everywhere. It is really necessary to give them strict training, because they can influence the public's minds. Enthusiastic educators in the city initiated the implementation of newspaper boy education. There are now about 10 levels of newspaper boy schools, enrolling more than 400 students. In addition to giving the newspaper boys the knowledge and skills of daily life and language education, special attention is paid to the reporting of current affairs knowledge, so that each newspaper boy can listen to the important news about current affairs every day. The teaching hours are based on the principle that they do not interfere with the children's time to sell newspapers. The school buildings are all combined with ordinary schools or other public places, and funds are being raised to expand the scale.</p>
<p>People's sports in Shanghai were once said to be developed. Before the war, the Social Bureau specially set up a people's sports section to guide people's sports throughout the city. It also held amateur sports meetings and walking competitions. The municipal stadiums trained people's sports without any surplus. The China National Sports Association also hosted international sports competitions. After the War of Resistance, all of the above institutions have been suspended, but the atmosphere of sports competitions is still booming. Except for track and field competitions, which are rarely held due to the lack of large venues, the practice and competition of football, basketball, tennis, swimming, etc. are still carried out as usual.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are many other social education enterprises that are too numerous to describe. For example, after the municipal library was destroyed, private individuals set up the Dingxiang Circulating Library, the China Circulating Library, and the Ding's Library, etc. In short, there are fewer public social education enterprises in Shanghai after the war and more private ones, especially tutorial schools are the most developed. Moreover, there are several enterprises that are jointly set up in one place. Due to the regulations of the concessions, they cannot be publicly attached outside, so a precise survey is not easy. The new social education enterprises are all needed by the war environment, and have profound significance in the process of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Circle and the Sharp Blade (2) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Wute Gong</p>
<p>Raw Material Plunder and Foreign Exchange Plunder</p>
<p>The Japanese mainland is now in constant need of large quantities of imports, especially raw materials that Japan itself does not produce. This requires foreign exchange to buy these items in the world's abundant markets. Japan's imports will increase with its military buildup and expansion of industrial equipment, and are expected to increase further. Japan hopes to rely on new sources of raw material control and foreign exchange earnings to become less dependent on foreign exchange in the import market. This is another motive for the war against China, and another reason for trying to expand the "Yen Bloc" to the conquered territories. Thus, the success or failure of this point is a major factor in the conditions for the future success or failure of Japan's efforts to expand its export industry using the "Yen Bloc." In terms of the supply of imported goods, the Japanese Empire has not been as generous as it has been to the export market. Before the outbreak of this war, the three major territories accounted for the following percentages of the total exports from the Japanese mainland: Taiwan 9.8%, Korea 14.2%, and "Manchukuo" 6.3%, totaling 30.3%. The three territories supplied all the food needed by Japan (food actually accounted for the majority of the goods sold by the three territories to the "mother country"). However, the proportion of the total amount of important raw materials and other goods needed by Japanese industry from the three territories was much smaller than the figures mentioned above. Before the war, China's exports to Japan accounted for 42% of the total amount purchased by the Japanese mainland from foreign countries. Now that China's most important commercial cities have been incorporated into the "Yen Bloc," Japan is now trying its best to take advantage of the opportunity to import more goods from China, but the results have disappointed the Japanese. Although the Japanese can seize any valuable items they see in the occupied areas, and expel foreigners who buy Chinese products; although the Japanese no longer need to use foreign exchange when shopping in China; and although the Japanese suppress prices and buy by force, or often confiscate things in practice using the methods commonly used domestically.</p>
<p>In the first eight months of 1938, the monthly average of Japan's imports from North China increased by three and a half times compared to 1936. During this period, there was still major military turmoil in Central China, and Japan's imports from that region had fallen to only one-fifth of what they were before. But once the situation in the region is similar to that in North China, the same increase can be expected. In the end, the resources of Central China will also be exploited in the same way. Although there are some possible hopes for the Japanese development plan, the victors know that even if they can achieve the greatest success they imagine, they still cannot make Japan less dependent on other foreign countries to supply its needs because of China. This is another reason for Japan to take advantage of the extremely perfect opportunity to incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc"; not only to completely extract every kind of raw material in China that is useful to Japan, but also to make China provide more foreign exchange to pay for Japan's continuous purchase of goods from foreign markets. Therefore, the main problem that Japan's "Greater Yen Bloc" must deal with is foreign exchange. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Empire was extremely dissatisfied with its foreign exchange situation. Now, let's go back to 1936, when Korea and Taiwan, like the Japanese mainland, were suffering from a shortage of foreign exchange. Although the total amount of goods they purchased from foreign countries, that is, non-Japanese countries, was small, it was still much more than the total amount sold to these countries. In 1936, the total amount of overdrafts they gave was paid by Japan in foreign exchange, totaling 57.3 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>According to official foreign trade reports, Japan's own trade deficit in the same year totaled 70.8 million Japanese yen. However, the largest part of the trade deficit (in 1936, Japan had to pay a huge amount for this, and exhausted all of its free gold reserves, and at the beginning of the war in 1937, it was forced to start selling huge amounts of gold) was related to "Manchukuo" and Dalian, its transit port in the Kwantung Leased Territory. These two Japanese territories, which were the initiators of the "Yen Bloc," had a trade deficit of 258.7 million Japanese yen. The difference in their import and export trade was indeed entirely due to their mutual transactions with the Japanese mainland, because the amount they purchased from the "mother country" far exceeded the total amount they rewarded to the "mother country." However, because the Japanese mainland and the Kwantung Leased Territory of "Manchukuo" both recorded such trade inaccurately in Japan's so-called foreign trade reports, and because both sides deliberately reduced Japan's trade deficit to the smallest possible attack by analogy, this difference should be listed as the largest of the three items to make up for the total amount of trade deficit between the Japanese Empire and various countries. If the incorporation of "Manchukuo" into the "Yen Bloc" did not enable Japan to provide for its own use the excess foreign exchange obtained from selling high-value soybeans in the trade between "Manchukuo" and non-Japanese foreign countries, then the above-mentioned difference would probably increase by more than 100 million Japanese yen. This point cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The Absolute Emptiness of the Foundation's Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Japan's foreign exchange problem is now more serious than before. In the first year of the war against China, Japan had spent 50% of its gold reserves. These golds had to be sold overseas to offset the empire's foreign trade deficit. Moreover, during this year of war, Japan also massively increased its purchases of military raw materials to maintain its stockpiles. The stockpiles of only these three items, cotton, wool, and American timber, had already used up 60%, 70%, and 80% respectively. Moreover, the foreign raw materials that are usually needed have been reduced to the extent that their imports cannot continue to be maintained. If this continues, then the export industry of Japanese manufactured goods such as cotton, which contains foreign raw materials, will be in danger of complete cessation. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem has made Japanese leaders even more uneasy, and they are even more skeptical about whether the gradual expansion of export trade within the "Yen Bloc" region is beneficial. The exported goods mostly contain raw materials that Japan needs to use foreign exchange to purchase in the world market. Although the export trade to the "Yen Bloc" region has expanded, the imports from these regions have not seen the same expansion, and Japan has not received the same opportunity to occupy the market's territories. The increase in the trade deficit caused by Japan's trade with its newest territories is now shown by the following figures. Japan's iron exports to the non-colonial part of the "Yen Bloc" averaged 41.5 million Japanese yen per month in 1936, but in the first eight months of 1938, it had increased to 89.6 million Japanese yen (although these exports have increased by more than double, Japan's exports to foreign countries in the same period were only half of the previous period). However, the average monthly import from the non-colonial territories subsidized by the "Yen Bloc" was only 19.9 million Japanese yen in 1936, and only 49 million Japanese yen in 1938. Japan has also not continued to receive much foreign exchange from these newly acquired places. The net amount of foreign exchange received by "Manchukuo" from the trade surplus from trade outside the "Yen Bloc" can be regarded as a gift to Japan. In 1936, it was 13.3 million Japanese yen per month, but in the first six months of 1938, "Manchukuo's" trade with foreign countries actually saw a deficit of 2 million Japanese yen per month, which had to be offset by Japan's allocation. Japan may be able to accumulate a considerable amount of foreign exchange in North China and Central China. Japanese personnel are now relying on the active assistance of the army in these two places to try to scrape together Chinese legal tender to exchange for "Federal Reserve" banknotes or Japanese yen banknotes, or to pay for Japanese exports. However, the Chinese government is now implementing a policy to maintain the legal tender so that it can be exchanged for foreign exchange. Therefore, the benefits obtained by Japan are indeed not very large. The legal tender still occupies a dominant position in most of the occupied areas, and the general public does not want it to fall into the hands of the Japanese. This is indeed the main obstacle encountered by the "Yen Bloc" in these areas.</p>
<p>As long as people think a little about Japan's trade surplus position in its transactions with the new territories in the "Yen Bloc," it is easy to understand why Japan should not discriminate against exports to various places in the "Yen Bloc." At least it should not send various manufactured goods containing foreign raw materials and capable of obtaining foreign exchange in the world market to the various places that have joined the "Yen Bloc." These new territories are now being regarded too much as an important part of the Japanese domestic market. On the mainland and in Japan in general, various trade regulations are planned in the sense of consumption to prevent goods from being sold to second-class customers who cannot pay in other currencies but can only pay in Japanese yen or rely on Japanese yen banknotes. This not only makes Japanese exporters very troubled, but also greatly frustrates the military who are eagerly promoting Sino-Japanese "cooperation." Therefore, the only thing Japan can sell now is to fully control China's exports to third countries and confiscate the foreign exchange obtained from this trade for the use of the "Yen Bloc." Only in this way can Japan's trade obtain various benefits from the newly emerging monetary alliance. These benefits will be the spoils of victory.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempts to Destroy the Whole</p>
<p>Japan's path of advancement in China is blocked, at least for the time being, because it cannot control the foreign exchange income obtained from China's exports to third countries. There is another more important reason: the new currency used by Japan in North China is just a piece of paper that can only be exchanged for another piece of paper and cannot be cashed. Protecting the failure of Japan's attempts has caused Japan to hesitate to use the same currency in China according to the original plan and to withdraw the "Japanese Yen Military Notes." This "Military Notes" cannot even be used as legal tender in a liberated New China. It can never gain the trust of any Chinese that the Japanese army's guns cannot reach. At a time when the Chinese legal tender can still be exchanged for foreign exchange, any new currency, at least with the backing of a portion of China's current foreign exchange income, can have an equal opportunity to fight with the Chinese legal tender and gradually abandon it. Therefore, if the Japanese want to achieve economic victory in the war against China, if they can, there is still one more hurdle to break through: because they cannot have the Chinese currency that allows exports to flow out, they cannot control China's export trade to third countries; because the inherent value of the Chinese legal tender far exceeds the substitutes they use, they cannot control or destroy the Chinese "old currency"; because before the Chinese legal tender is completely destroyed, if they want to create a better substitute, the only obvious way is to make this substitute freely exchangeable for gold yuan or gold pounds. In the current situation, it can only be exchanged by transporting Chinese goods to foreign countries, so they cannot create a better substitute than the Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now using bayonets to carry out this work, trying to reduce the flow of Chinese products to the world market, but not only has it failed to achieve results, but it has also encouraged them to export. Therefore, the construction of the "Yen Bloc" in China is still far from being completed. No matter what kind of close economic and financial relationship Japan and its firmly controlled territories have on the one hand, and the occupied areas in China on the other, this relationship is still completely based on the barbaric power of the Japanese army: a closer monetary alliance, a more intelligent and more coercive force, has not yet truly been realized. Even if a "peace treaty" is concluded between the two countries, even if this peace treaty allows Japan's desire to rule China to come true, it is difficult to expect these situations to undergo rapid changes.</p>
<p>At the same time, Japan is now using force to at least lay the foundation for those economic policies, hoping that the monetary mechanism of the "Yen Bloc" will eventually proceed smoothly, effectively, and almost automatically, so that the encroachment on the interests of China or third countries will not be overly exposed: and it is preparing to make Chinese members use the name of a New China to implement modern methods of controlling foreign exchange to replace the current means of Japanese army and navy officers' habitual brutal interference in trade and industry. A refined and discriminatory bureaucratic system—such as licenses, quotas, restrictive regulations, donations and taxes, and manipulation of tax rules, credit and loan regulations, etc. Japan has developed all of this in its country and its territories into its recent feudalism, which has been extremely successful, along with the two major patented enterprises that have been given to Japan, namely the development companies of North China and Central China. Now, it has quietly planned to achieve Japan's ambition. This is nothing more than turning China into a major part of the Yen Bloc, like Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo; developing various Chinese products that are useful to Japan; turning other products or future competition with Japanese industries into non-existent; turning China's pre-war vast and increasingly self-sufficient power into complete dependence on Japan; and reducing China's economic exchanges with the world outside the Yen Bloc to a degree suitable for Japan's own needs. However, Japan wants to achieve this economic victory over China and the long-established interests of the Taixi. The future is uncertain, and it remains to be seen when the goal will be achieved, because the interests of the Taixi and the modern progress of China are closely integrated, and it has become a legitimate and independent unit in the whole country. Even if Japan can achieve this economic victory because of the resistance of the Taixi or its inability to maintain China's own long-term resistance, it seems that there is no guarantee that Japan's economic problems will be solved within the "Greater Yen Bloc."

<p>— Mu Xin</p>
<p>[Min Ge News Agency, Dusi Correspondence] When the military offensive of the [Japanese] bandits encountered the most stubborn resistance, the [Japanese] bandits began their despicable and shameless political conspiracies everywhere. They used all kinds of deceptive and numbing propaganda in an attempt to divide our unity and the enthusiastic support of the people for our government. In order to more conveniently exploit and control our people, the [Japanese] bandits used money to buy off the corrupt and traitorous elements in various parts of our country to establish puppet organizations—traitorous governments. Based on the results of recent investigations and interviews by reporters, and referring to the research on captured [Japanese] puppet documents, the ugliness of the [Japanese] puppet and traitorous organizations in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces are specially reported to readers in various regions.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, fell on November 8th of the year before last (1937). After our troops withdrew from the city, a group of shameless traitors began activities to establish a puppet organization. On December 28th, the traitors Han Qian and Guo Xiang[sheng], etc., organized the false "Shanxi Provincial Provisional Government Preparatory Committee," and officially began preparing the puppet organization on that day.</p>
<p>It was not until June 20th of last year—1938, that the puppet "Beijing Provisional Government" issued an order officially establishing the puppet "Shanxi Provincial Public Office," and simultaneously announced the organization chart of the puppet provincial office and its list of personnel. The traitorous newspaper, "Shanxi Xinmin" newspaper, even published a special issue to "congratulate" the establishment of this puppet organization.</p>
<p>The puppet organization has a supreme advisor at the top, serving as the "supreme commander" of the puppet organization. Below is a governor, a secretary-general, and three councilors. It is divided into four departments: civil affairs, finance, construction, and education. There is also an advisory councilor and three counselors. The elements of these degenerates are some hooligans, former Qing Dynasty "selected tribute students", opium and alcohol addicts, and other traitors. The traitor Gao Buqing used to be the manager of the Shanxi Provincial Bank. He was arrested and imprisoned for bribery and fraud. He was only released after the July 7th Incident, and is a shameless parasite.</p>
<p>The puppet Shanxi Provincial Public Office is the supreme leading agency of the Shanxi puppet administrative organization. In addition, wherever [Japanese] bandit forces can reach, puppet county public offices are established. According to Li Qichang, the puppet education section chief of Hongdong, who was arrested by our side, the general structure of the [Japanese] puppet organization in each county is divided into three sections, under the leadership of the puppet county public office, the maintenance society, and the special agent organization.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several things led by the [Japanese] bandit special agent organization: a "political work team" serving as "county office advisors," an "economic work team" engaging in fraud and manipulation, a garrison team guarding the city, a "reassurance team" specializing in false and deceptive political propaganda, a "lotus leaf team" specializing in repairing local structures, and an "ox path team" responsible for repairing roads.</p>
<p>It can be said that the [Japanese] bandits have established many agencies in various places; however, these agencies are surrounded by our guerrillas, making it difficult for them to exert their effectiveness outside the city walls. Even the [Japanese] puppet regime in Taiyuan cannot extend its policies beyond ten li outside the city. In the entire Shanxi, our anti-Japanese regime still exists in all 105 counties.</p>
<p>Therefore, these traitorous governments are fundamentally puppet organizations of the [Japanese] bandits, so the [Japanese] bandits will abolish or reorganize them at any time when they see them as displeasing or inconvenient to use. The puppet organizations in Suiyuan and Chahar were reorganized by the [Japanese] bandits recently for this reason.</p>
<p>After the reorganization, the [Japanese] puppet organization linked Suiyuan and Chahar to form the "Mongolian League Autonomous Government", realizing the [Japanese] bandits' dream of a "Mongol state" that had been in their minds for a long time.</p>
<p>The "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" has a chairman and vice-chairman. The chairman is the well-known traitor De Wang, and the vice-chairman is the traitor Li Shouxin. Below them are four departments—security department, general affairs department, livestock production department, and military affairs department. The security minister is called "Jia'er Gela". The puppet affairs are Tao Ketao. The production department is unclear. The military affairs department is a department that has just been organized and has not yet announced its personnel. Among these four departments, the continued affairs department is the largest, and it has five departments: civil affairs, finance, education, and other departments.</p>
<p>The various local governments of Sui and Chahar are under the direct jurisdiction of the "Mongolian League Autonomous Government". They divided the two provinces (all of Chahar, and most of Suiyuan) into five league public offices and two special municipalities.</p>
<p>The functions of the puppet league public office are similar to our administrative regions, and are divided into three departments: civil affairs, security, and production. The five leagues are: Chahar League, Xilin Gol League, Ujimqin League, Yikezhao League, and Bayantala League. The puppet league leader of Chahar is [unclear]. Ujimqin League is Prince Lin (Prince of Zhonggong Banner). Yikezhao League is Balegedong. Bayantala League is Bao Yingerlegere. The Xilin Gol League is unclear. The past local bureaus of Suiyuan are mostly included in Bayantala League.</p>
<p>The two special municipalities are: "Hohhot Special Municipality" and Baotou Special Municipality. The mayor of the former is He Bingwen (former president of the Chamber of Commerce), and the mayor of the latter is called Liu Jiguang. Hohhot Special Municipality is the original Guihua City, and Guisui County is also merged into it. The puppet "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" of Chahar and Suiyuan and other organizations below it, like puppet organizations in other places, are mere puppets. The actual power lies in the hands of the Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>However, no matter how the [Japanese] bandits "reorganize" and "strengthen" the puppet organizations, they will not have any effect. From the far north of Suiyuan and Chahar to the southernmost part of Shanxi, our guerrillas are everywhere [unclear], bravely [unclear] the anti-Japanese national revolutionary [unclear] regime. The ordinary wave of resistance from the people in various places has [unclear] the [Japanese] bandits and puppet organizations one by one on small "prison" like points and lines, giving the [Japanese] bandits constant siege and strikes.</p>
<p>Among these puppet organizations, in addition to those great traitors who are willing to be running dogs for the [Japanese] bandits, the others, especially the lower-level staff, feel the greatest pain and the greatest hatred for the [Japanese] [unclear] and the shamelessness of the great traitors. Even these great traitors also feel uneasy and sad because they are subject to interference from the [Japanese] '[unclear]' (special agent organization) everywhere. Most of the puppet troops have become aware of the [Japanese] [unclear]'s [unclear] and oppression, and they are constantly defecting in batches, some committing suicide, and continuous escapes have become a common phenomenon.</p>
<p>Following the upsurge of the people's war of resistance, and with the awakening of the [Japanese] puppet soldiers and lower-level staff, under the heroic situation of "inside and outside cooperation", all puppet organizations will eventually become the tombs of the [Japanese] bandits and traitors, burying their own corpses.</p>

<p>— Sen Ran</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping] Since the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces have been lost. The anti-Japanese war in Rehe was a flash in the pan. For the past seven years, the Japanese have been operating in the four northeastern provinces, and although they have achieved some success, the patriotic feelings of our people in Rehe, and the guerrilla activities of the Volunteer Army, are clear proof that the Northeast is not lost. Recently, a visitor came from Rehe to describe the general situation there. I will briefly record it to inform those in the rear who are concerned about the situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The loss of Rehe was due to the tyranny of Tang Yulin's era, and the weak national consciousness of some of the people. The direct cause was the lack of defense and the soldiers being unprepared. When Tang committed outrageous exactions and oppressed the people for a long time in Rehe, the Japanese troops immediately disintegrated upon arrival. At that time, the Japanese relied heavily on the guidance of a small number of treacherous people. Rehe is naturally dangerous, and those who are not familiar with the terrain cannot be bandits. Some ignorant people even regarded the Japanese as saviors, initially unaware that they were leading wolves into the house and replacing one tyranny with another. After the iron hooves of the Japanese invasion had gained a stable foothold, these people gradually began to taste the feeling of national subjugation, and their suffering increased day by day, until they rose up to resist, but it was already too late. Rehe is inhabited by Han and Mongol people, and originally governed sixteen counties and four administrative bureaus. Now the administrative bureaus have all been upgraded to counties, totaling twenty counties. There are six million Han people and five hundred thousand Mongol people, most of whom are poor and live in difficult conditions. The so-called officials, gentry, wealthy households, and small families account for only one or two percent of the population.</p>
<p>Since there are so many poor people in Rehe, many people have risen up due to the Japanese high-pressure resistance, which is due to the environment and life. The Northeast Volunteer Army has risen from scratch since September 18th, and the main force is the troops of General Li Du. The soldiers in Rehe belonged to a part of the 12th Army of General Li. Among them, there were personnel from the Eighth Route Army who were active in the border area of Jin, Ji, and Cha. Last year, they entered the Liao region via eastern Hebei, and shared the guerrilla responsibilities with the 12th Army. They went deep into the people, and the cover was quite confidential. Although only 5,000 people were actually engaged in activities and battles, there were no fewer than 30,000 people lying dormant waiting for opportunities. However, since the Japanese bandits occupied Rehe, they have been using the great dangers, and the defenses at the mouths of the river are particularly strict. The highway network is crisscrossed and built of asphalt and gravel. Each village office is equipped with a telephone, and the transportation and communication are very sensitive and convenient, so the activities of our guerrillas are quite difficult. When the Eighth Route Army entered Rehe from eastern Hebei via Panjiakou last autumn, they fought with the [Japanese] bandits in the area of Fengning on the border of [unclear] and Cha, and there was no smooth progress because of this. At the moment, our troops in Rehe are lurking in the depths of the mountains and forests, taking the opportunity to move out, suddenly destroying the [Japanese] bandits' transportation, and intercepting their logistics transport vehicles for our use. Or they disguise themselves and enter the towns and cities to burn the [Japanese] bandits' rear food warehouses, avoiding frontal battles with the [Japanese] bandits. When the [Japanese] bandits come, we leave; when the [Japanese] bandits retreat, we gather, making the [Japanese] bandits exhausted and unable to catch us.</p>
<p>Most of the guerrillas in Rehe are natives of Rehe, good at riding and shooting, and have a strong and brave personality to kill [Japanese] bandits. They are familiar with the geography and appear and disappear unpredictably. If they can be trained again and taught the methods of modern warfare, they will surely become the elite troops on the front line of the war against [Japanese] bandits. The anti-Japanese sentiment of the people is also rising day by day. In the past, when the [Japanese] bandits first occupied Rehe, they searched every household for guns, and no private possession was allowed. Therefore, most of the civilian guns were taken away by the [Japanese] bandits. Now the people's anti-Japanese war is fought with bayonets and hand-to-hand combat with the [Japanese] bandits, or even with knives and sticks to intercept the [Japanese] bandits' cars. Their heroic and decisive spirit is like this.</p>
<p>The Japanese have been planning to invade the Northeast for decades, so after September 18th, they actively promoted their planned economic and political policies, and achieved considerable success. This is an undeniable fact. Since July 7th, the [Japanese] bandits have been acting in North China in the same way, but the effect is very poor. The reason is that when the [Japanese] bandits first captured the Northeast, they fooled the people who did not know the misery of national subjugation, and had not tasted the taste of slaves. When they saw the violence of the [Japanese] bandits, and the plunder of the [Japanese] [unclear], they hated it very much. Even the traitors have seen the gradual weakening of the puppet officials in the Northeast, and the arrogance and deception of the Japanese officials, and deeply regretted it. Therefore, what the [Japanese] bandits did in the Northeast and could be effective, can no longer be used in North China. The increase and strengthening of national consciousness and national concepts are the focus of the defeat of my political training and the superiority of the Japanese. After the [Japanese] bandits' military [unclear], there is no good politics to follow, only killing and implicating people. The greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. Rehe--even the Northeast--the local people's excitement is not because of the [Japanese] bandits' tyranny and inhumanity.</p>
<p>Although our political work in Rehe is not as thorough as in Hebei and Shanxi, it is quite successful. Each county has several liaison officers assigned to be responsible for intelligence and propaganda, instilling anti-Japanese ideas and strengthening civilian organizations. However, in terms of military affairs, due to the [Japanese] bandits' advantageous transportation and communication, there is still no significant effect. As for the [Japanese] bandits' political work, they are extremely strict in preventing our people, and no matter the size of the agency, the Japanese hold the real power and regard the puppets as puppets. For example, in the county government, the Japanese are called counselors, now changed to deputy county magistrates, and they have the power to kill at will. The directors of the police bureaus in each county are all Japanese, and are no different from the deputy county magistrates. Below the police bureau are five or seven police stations, each of which has two Japanese instructors, dividing the area into several districts, each with a public office, which is the so-called "autonomous agency" of the [Japanese] bandits.</p>
<p>The latest household registration of the entire Rehe has been completed, and the household registration books are kept separately in the police station and the district office. The increase or decrease of people [unclear] reported in time. Registration is only carried out after verification. Those who leave the village and return after staying overnight must also report to the district office to request the police station to issue an identity certificate. Those who go out for a long time must find joint guarantors to clarify the reasons for the record, and the police station will issue a passport, stating all restrictions before they are allowed to travel, and they must first state the deadline before traveling. If they do not return after the deadline, the guarantors and their families will be arrested, and even sentenced to death for "collusion." The cruelty of the restrictions and the harshness of the punishment make the people dare not speak out in anger, and the resentment is deeper than this.</p>
<p>Although there is no newspaper propaganda in Rehe, the people are happy when they hear that the guerrillas are active somewhere, and they spread the news to each other, and use "the Central Army has come" as comfort. Even the puppet troops and puppet police under the high pressure of the [Japanese] bandits also have this mentality, hoping that the war can extend to Rehe, so that there is an opportunity to turn around and surrender. Therefore, the [Japanese] bandits in Rehe do not dare to send puppet troops to the "cleanup work" against our guerrillas, for fear that the puppet troops will defect and turn their guns on them. At the moment, the Rehe puppet army is about 10,000 people under the command of Xing Ni Shi [unclear], numbered the First Fifth Route Central Control District Command Headquarters, and is completely stationed in Chengde. Other county garrisons are called "Japanese Security Team," but their strength is scattered and weak, and they are not worth attacking. Our guerrillas are therefore very successful. Although the [Japanese] bandits try their best, it is difficult to achieve any effect. Once the Qing [unclear] rise up, the guerrillas' activities will be more active and can be asserted.</p>
<p>The [Japanese] bandits are suspicious, and it is heard every day that innocent civilians in Rehe are being arrested and massacred. Recently, due to the activity of the guerrillas in Rehe, a large-scale inspection was carried out, and many well-known people in each county were arrested by the [Japanese] bandits for no reason. The situation in the entire Rehe is disturbed and in a state of extreme terror. The traitors are also feeling that everyone is in danger. The loyal and righteous people are waiting for the opportunity to move, and the people are automatically joining the guerrillas more and more every day. Therefore, today's Rehe has almost set off an angry wave of resistance against [Japanese] bandits. (April 5th)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Dispatch] The Soviet Union has previously expressed its willingness to conclude a military mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France. It is now heard that the Soviet Union has also proposed that countries that fear aggression by National Socialist Fascist dictatorial countries should hold an international conference. According to French diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union suggested that all countries concerned with maintaining the status quo of Eastern and Western Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Danube River basin, and the Scandinavian Peninsula should participate in the conference and conclude a collective security agreement, stipulating that once Germany and Italy continue to launch aggressive actions, all contracting countries should resist them with force.</p>
<p>[Hai Tong News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, who is still staying in Moscow to report to his government on Britain's response to the Soviet anti-aggression proposal, will leave the Soviet Union tonight and is expected to arrive here on Tuesday or Wednesday. British political circles believe that Maisky and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds have successively engaged with the Soviet government, and the process has been very smooth. Therefore, the details of the British-Soviet negotiations can be published soon. British political circles also said that Britain is only prepared to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union's western border and does not include its eastern border. Recalling the French-Russian agreement before 1914, there were also similar restrictions. It should also be noted that the agreement to be concluded this time is not an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but rather individual ties between Britain and France and the Soviet Union. After the above-mentioned treaty is concluded, a new alliance will also be established.</p>
<p>[Hai Agency, Moscow, 24th Dispatch] It was announced here today that Foreign Minister Potemkin will go to the Turkish capital within days. According to political sources, Soviet-Turkish negotiations have reached the final stage and an agreement will be established soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson left Britain this afternoon to return to Berlin. According to outside speculation, Henderson will not return to Berlin until next month. This move was unexpected. However, according to sources, there is no special political importance to Henderson's urgent return to Germany. It is heard that the French Ambassador to Germany will also return to Berlin in a few days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson was summoned back to China on the 10th of last month (i.e., after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia), and it has been over a month. A certain person in political circles recently commented that the British government has once again taken a appeasement move, and it is rumored that Germany has pulled back from the brink and is willing to adopt a negotiating approach rather than intimidation. However, Britain's intensified expansion of armaments and organization of collective security will not be weakened by this. Others said that the recall of Ambassador Henderson was to condemn Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Now that the government has decided to form a peace group in Europe in the hope of achieving a permanent solution, temporary measures, such as recalling ambassadors, are no longer necessary.</p>
<p>[London, 24th Dispatch] Foreign news, the diplomatic circles here are very concerned about the sudden return of British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson to Berlin. It is reported that Henderson was instructed by Chamberlain and Halifax to discuss matters in Berlin with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Henderson was summoned in the middle of last month to protest against Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. His return to Berlin this time, just before Hitler's speech on the 28th, has attracted particular attention from all parties. It is reported that Chamberlain and Halifax met with Henderson on Friday night and decided to send him back to Berlin on Saturday night.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] According to a report by the diplomatic correspondent of the 'Daily Telegraph', the Navy plans to lay the keels of twenty 900-ton escort vessels in June. These escort vessels are similar in size to the destroyers of the pre-European War era. They are the fastest, best-equipped, and most efficient among escort vessels, and are capable of withstanding attacks from submarines and aircraft. In order to expedite the shipbuilding process, the Navy plans to start construction on eight of the sixteen destroyers planned for this year. The construction of large warships is also being actively promoted. Including those under construction, those about to be built, and those already completed, the total tonnage of large warships exceeds 950,000 tons. Sixteen old-style cruisers and thirty-six destroyers have been modified by the Navy into escort vessels capable of defending against aircraft and submarines. The naval authorities are also adding eight new-style guns per month, mainly anti-aircraft guns. The production capacity of cannons has increased sixfold since 1936. Furthermore, in order to protect merchant ships, more than 2,000 heavy guns are stored in major ports to prepare for unforeseen events. The strength of the British Navy has broken the record since the Napoleonic Wars, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Cabinet will discuss the conscription issue tomorrow. A memorandum on the matter will be submitted to Cabinet members for review, but it is feared that a decision will be difficult to reach immediately. The Cabinet will also hear Simon's budget proposals. There is widespread concern that income tax will be increased, and sugar, tobacco, and tea will be presented as potential sources of increased revenue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon is scheduled to present the 1939-1940 budget to the House of Commons tomorrow. The defense expenditure is listed as £580 million, the highest amount ever for peacetime defense. The total annual budget is expected to be around £1.266 billion. Air Force expenditure is expected to be £208 million. War debt to the United States is not included in the budget.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The British Ambassador to France, Phipps, met with French Prime Minister Daladier this morning, and then with French Foreign Minister Bonnet in the afternoon. The 'Times' learned that the nature of the talks was the issue of Britain implementing compulsory conscription. This is a precautionary measure to ensure that Britain can immediately strengthen its military to cope with aggression when the situation requires. The report also stated that Chamberlain has now recognized that methods must be changed. Given past experience, all negotiations are ineffective without strength as a backing. The democratic countries' struggle for peace, like preparations for war, must rely on strength to achieve their policies.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after meeting with Romanian Ambassador to Paris Titulescu last night, departed for England and arrived at Victoria Station at 5:20 pm today. The Romanian Minister to Britain, Tilea, had gone to Folkestone in advance to greet him and accompany him to the station. British Foreign Secretary Halifax personally went to the station to welcome him. Also present were the ambassadors of Poland and Turkey, the Greek Minister to Britain, and many officials from the Romanian Embassy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu went to the Foreign Office this morning to meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax and begin talks. The Romanian Foreign Minister will also go to the House of Commons this afternoon to meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain. Gafencu is accompanied by two secretaries, but no commercial experts. Commercial negotiations between Britain and Romania will begin on the 25th of this month in the Romanian capital. The British delegation led by Zeros is expected to arrive in the Romanian capital today. It is not known whether the Romanian Foreign Minister will meet with Trade Minister Stanley, but no formal consultations have been scheduled.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax tomorrow morning and Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. At that time, Gafencu will present the progress of Romania's negotiations with Turkey, Poland, and the Balkan countries, along with Germany's attitude. Germany believes that Romania's joining an anti-aggression group is extremely undesirable and that Romania's closeness to Soviet Russia is more dangerous than aligning with Germany or Hungary. Germany is also prepared to provide guarantees for Romania's borders, as Britain has offered to Romania, but on the condition that Romania does not provide the same assistance to Britain.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The increased tariff on imports of German goods by the United States officially came into effect at noon on the 23rd. However, because the customs office is closed on Sunday mornings, the new tariff regulations were actually implemented starting at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 23rd] Tanner Pabe, First Secretary of the German Embassy, gave a speech today, solemnly refuting that German trade development is detrimental to the trade of the United States and democratic countries, and that it is not connected with extending political influence to Latin American countries.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 23rd] It is reported that Hitler will mention the replies of various small countries to Germany's inquiries when he speaks to the German Parliament on the 28th. Reliable sources have not yet been able to confirm that Axis countries will hold negotiations in the coming days, including a military conference of generals from Germany, Italy, and Spain. It is also heard that Germany is now preparing a vigorous diplomatic campaign, especially focusing on Southeastern Europe, on the one hand, strengthening the position of totalitarian countries, and on the other hand, undermining the efforts of Britain and France to form a "peace front."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The Foreign Minister of Hungary is scheduled to visit here on the 26th of this month. The official here generally expresses great hope for this move, preparing to carry out the second step of the "Axis activities," planning to contact the Balkan countries and organize an "anti-encirclement group." Political circles believe that the participation of Hungary and Bulgaria should not be a problem, so they are stepping up efforts to win over Yugoslavia. Germany may explicitly inform the Yugoslav Foreign Minister that Germany is prepared to strongly support Italy's activities in the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, it has mentioned the issue of the German minority within Yugoslavia and the Karlovy Vary region, indicating that the issue is similar to that of Czechoslovakia and must be resolved. Sources in this country indicate that the Yugoslav Foreign Minister will still try to maintain neutrality and adopt an impartial attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia apparently have not yet concluded a new agreement. Great attention is being paid to this here. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia is still hesitant to accept the proposals of the Axis countries. It is heard that the proposals are to withdraw Hungary's demands on Yugoslavia and guarantee Yugoslavia against German and Italian aggression, but with the following three conditions: (1) Yugoslavia joins the Anti-Comintern Pact; (2) Reorganize the Yugoslav army under the supervision of Germany and Italy; (3) Yugoslavia and Italy sign a commercial treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, London believes that today's report on the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice indicates a further step in the existing friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. Foreign observers believe that Yugoslavia's attitude is that the Axis countries' pressure on Yugoslavia is stronger than the guarantees provided by distant countries. Italy's emphasis on the Adriatic Sea and on maintaining Yugoslavia's integrity is sufficient to guarantee against possible oppression from the north. However, the widespread antipathy of the Yugoslav people towards the Axis countries cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Venice, 23rd] The Yugoslav Foreign Minister departed for his country this afternoon and plans to visit Germany in the near future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Venice, 23rd] The two-day negotiations between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister have been completed. An official gazette was published today, stating that the South has formally united with the dictatorial countries. The gazette stated, "The Yugoslav government has agreed to strengthen cooperation with Germany and Italy in political and economic aspects, while maintaining friendly relations with Hungary. It is said that Ciano this time represents Germany and Italy, to establish a Balkan group, including Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] It is generally believed that the negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia in Venice will have the following results: (1) A line of countries in Eastern Europe and the Danube River basin; (2) Yugoslavia's future policy will be completely controlled by Italy. It is said that Yugoslavia will not participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact but has agreed to sign a friendly treaty with Hungary.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 24th] The agency views the results of the talks between the Italian and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers in Venice as a victory for the Axis countries, creating a further success in tearing apart the encirclement policy.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the meeting of the Manchester China Relief Committee today, "I believe that in a year's time, whether or not an international war occurs, we will see signs of a peaceful resolution in the Far East, because the European democratic countries have begun to resist aggression. Chamberlain has declared that the countries in the anti-aggression front include China. President Roosevelt has ordered the US fleet to sail to the Pacific, and the Japanese people have also begun to loathe war. However, the Japanese warlords have not yet abandoned their attempt to conquer China, and the Chinese people must redouble their efforts and continue to resist." The secretary of the China Relief Committee, Thompson, said that every advance or retreat of the Chinese army will cause great suffering. He has appealed to all sectors to donate 50,000 sets of military uniforms by the end of this month and has now completed it. Manchester has donated 17,000 sets.

<h3 id="e30">Ms. Smedley's Call <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Truth and justice are not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>China's war of resistance against Japan is a war to protect truth and justice. Therefore, in this war, it has attracted hundreds and thousands of international people who cherish truth and justice, including communists, Christians, military and technical experts, journalists, and men and women of all races, fields, and classes.</p>
<p>They ran to China instead of Japan, and even those in Japan who cherished truth and justice ran to China, such as Mr. Rokuchi Kōichi and others, who are willing to work for China's liberation.</p>
<p>Ms. Smedley is just one of the hundreds and thousands of people who are willing to sacrifice and serve for China's war of truth and justice. However, Ms. Smedley's past efforts have been enough to make righteous people all over the world hear about it and be inspired. Ms. Smedley recently also sent a letter from the southeastern battlefield, concerning the situation of the New Fourth Army's soldiers who were bravely fighting but were wounded and had no one to rescue them, to the wife of the Director of Hygiene in Hong Kong, Yongjue, appealing to Western doctors living in comfort to temporarily put down their comfort and go to rescue thousands of wounded soldiers fighting for truth and justice. Ms. Smedley shouted loudly:</p>
<p>Chinese Western doctors and foreign Western doctors, these people (Chinese soldiers), for the sake of human culture's life, do not seek fame, do not seek profit, and go to the front line to fight and die without any welcome or farewell. Are you really not helping? Can you not be disturbed by nightmares at night? Don't you feel ashamed when you look in the mirror? If these people are defeated, can you have no fear for the future of you and your descendants?</p>
<p>We Chinese compatriots who are spared the gunfire and live under the influence of foreigners! Our Chinese doctors and nurses! Can we not be moved by Ms. Smedley's appeal? We dare to use Ms. Smedley's words with ardent enthusiasm to appeal to everyone:</p>
<p>"Please temporarily put down your lack of love and go to the front line in China, where you can deal with various problems, various difficulties, and various painful things, fight for justice, and take care of the brave men who die for your sons and your country. Don't leave a shameful mark in national history!"</p>
<p>All men and women who love truth and justice all over the world, even within the × country of Japan, do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles to the battlefield in China to serve the Chinese war. Can it be that we Chinese compatriots ourselves are willing to live under the influence of foreigners in a timid and shameless manner? At the same time, we want to ask, foreign newspapers have published in large print the articles of Ms. Smedley and other righteous people calling for aid for Chinese soldiers. Could it be that our own Chinese newspapers indifferently and shamelessly throw these calls for justice and humanity into the wastebasket?</p>
<p>Don't you feel ashamed?</p>
<p>Truth and justice are calling out to you!</p>
<h3 id="e31">No War in Europe <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Ping</p>
<p>To understand Chamberlain's lack of resolve, look at his two declarations: "If any action occurs at this time that threatens Poland's independence, and the Polish government believes it must resist with all its strength, the British government will immediately provide Poland with assistance." "For all actions that clearly threaten the independence of Greece or Romania, and the governments of Greece or Romania believe that they must resist with all their strength, the Imperial Government will consider it a treaty of mutual assistance with Greece or Romania."</p>
<p>Isn't that very clear? What Britain and France guarantee is only the "independence" of Poland, Greece, and Romania, and only if the "government" of that country "believes it must resist with all its strength."</p>
<p>Later, French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated that "territorial integrity" was also included in the guarantee in addition to "independence." But he still said: "If Germany attacks Danzig, Poland will resist with all its strength. We will immediately aid Poland." But how does one determine "resisting with all its strength"?</p>
<p>We admit that the British and French declarations did shatter Germany and Italy's "extortion and aggression" attempts, but they also opened a door of convenience for Germany and Italy: "diplomatic aggression."</p>
<p>Due to the restrictions of the British and French declarations, Germany and Italy did not "attack" by force, but changed to diplomatic aggression. Therefore, Italy and Hungary, Italy and Greece, Germany and Hungary, Germany and Yugoslavia have all had talks. Even the Associated Press reported that Germany and Poland had reached an understanding and were prepared to return Danzig to Germany.</p>
<p>If the Axis powers use "diplomatic aggression" and gain significant gains, I don't know how Chamberlain will issue another declaration to save this mistake.</p>
<p>Therefore, we agree with Major Attlee's words that this declaration is too weak. Why is it so weak? In the end, it is because Chamberlain's group fears war.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>It has been made very clear above that whether democratic countries or Axis countries, psychologically and traditionally, fundamentally fear war and have not yet reached the point of resolving to resort to force. Now, we are willing to provide two reasons in diplomacy, military preparedness, and the general situation why the walls cannot be torn down and a duel cannot be started.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Axis countries. The most obvious, we list five points</p>
<p>First, we understand very well that after the Treaty of Versailles, Britain, France, and the United States were countries that maintained the status quo, while Germany and Italy were countries that attempted to break the status quo. But there are too many ways to break the status quo. Germany and Italy avoided the important and chose the light, abandoning war and using intimidation. After repeated trials and validations, to this day, because democratic countries have the resolution to unite and use force to stop aggression, Germany and Italy can still use intimidation or new "diplomatic aggression" to achieve their ambitions. They must not risk war.</p>
<p>Second, even if we take a step back, if the democratic countries are determined to resist, then Germany and Italy's tricks of intimidation and diplomatic aggression will naturally not work. But will they fight hard? No, definitely not. We believe that if Germany and Italy had been fighting for land in 1935, they would never do it now. They have already increased a lot of land. The current territory of Germany and Italy is much larger than in 1914. The power of Germany has opened up a new epoch in history. We can say that Germany and Italy have now reached a point where they can almost be conservative. At least, we believe that Germany and Italy have no intention of quickly giving away the large amount of land and interests they have painstakingly gained in the war.</p>
<p>Third, the military strength of the Axis powers is not as good as that of the democratic countries, which is an important reason why Germany and Italy do not dare to fight rashly. Although Germany and Italy have tried their best to prepare in recent years, they are still difficult to make great progress due to financial resources, manpower, and resources. According to the statistics in January 1939, the military strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan was four-fifths of that of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. And the poor resources in particular cannot support a long-term war. But if a war breaks out, the war must be long-term and costly.</p>
<p>Fourth, the failure to fully develop the anti-communist front has made Germany and Italy often worry about their rear. The first is Japan. Although it has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, because of the war in China, after falling into a quagmire, Hiranuma recently said in a cautious tone: "Japan does not belong to democratic countries, nor does it belong to totalitarian countries." It has officially withdrawn from Germany and the Soviet Union's stage. Germany and Italy have also politely declined Japan's request for a military alliance. This makes Germany and Italy have to hesitate a little before launching a war.</p>
<p>Fifth, Germany and the newly occupied colonies, Czechoslovakia and Albania, and even Abyssinia and Australia, although occupied by Hitler and Mussolini in one fell swoop, are full of internal hidden crises and naturally require a long period of reorganization. Before this work is completed, Germany and Italy will not act rashly.</p>
<p>Now, here are the reasons why the democratic countries are reluctant to fight. We list the three most obvious points:</p>
<p>(1) The democratic countries' wartime preparations have not been completed. Britain and France have been too lax since the war. Because of the national praise of peace, their military preparedness has been very lax. The two countries' first-line troops combined are not as good as Germany's. The worst is the air force, which is too far behind the Axis countries. Combined, they are less than half of Germany and Italy's. Chamberlain and Daladier, looking at the beautiful prosperity of London and Paris, how can they be willing to suffer losses in the present? They can only delay time, waiting desperately to catch up.</p>
<p>(2) The attitude of the United States is a major guide for the actions of the main countries. Although Roosevelt issued a proposal, it was just empty talk and a way to gain fame and reputation. He has no determination to provide real assistance to the democratic countries. Therefore, for Britain and France to stand up and fight, the United States must show a full attitude.</p>
<p>(3) The cooperation of the Soviet Union is even more important. We know that Britain's deeply rooted traditional policy is not to associate with the Soviet Union. ××××××, it would rather see the pure freedom on the British Isles than see the Bolsheviks raise their eyebrows. Now, the situation is pressing, and Britain and the Soviet Union are conducting negotiations and have concluded them satisfactorily. However, what the future holds and how true cooperation will be realized, we can only wait and see! Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, the democratic countries will not be able to stand up.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Now, many people are vigorously promoting that a great war is about to break out, saying: "The Second World War is inevitable, and when it will break out is only a matter of time." We do not deny this sentence. So-called "one time" is it a matter of days, months, or years?</p>
<p>Our opinion is: There will be no war in Europe this year, 1939. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Frequent Tragedies in Jin Tian Refugee Camp; Refugees List Facts of Abuse; Police Chief Inspector Discusses Reality of Camp Staff Beating Pregnant Women; Camp Rules Strictly Prohibit Corporal Punishment, Violators Will Be Strictly Investigated <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the frequent tragedies occurring in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp, all the refugees have separately sent letters to the Chinese and Western Emergency Committee and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce,訴 expressing their experiences and requesting a thorough investigation of the perpetrators and their punishment. Chinese representatives Sir Robert Ho Tung and barrister Lo Man Kam, as well as Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Cary, have expressed extreme concern upon hearing this news and are conducting a thorough investigation. These matters have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. The reporter, therefore, made a special visit to the Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze To Wing-kwok, to inquire about the truth of the case. He agreed to give a statement detailing the course of events. Furthermore, all the refugees in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp, in order to inform the public about what has happened and to seek assistance, have issued an appeal to all sectors of society. The text is over a thousand words long, and every word is filled with sorrow. It is recorded below for the readers to observe separately.</p>
<p>Sze To Wing-kwok Issues Statement</p>
<p>According to Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze To Wing-kwok, told the reporter that managers had indeed illegally beaten refugees, but the claim that someone was beaten to death was unfounded. According to his investigation, the truth is that because the Jin Tian Refugee Camp is entirely made of sunflower sheds, camp regulations strictly prohibit smoking and private cooking, fearing a careless fire that could endanger the lives of four thousand refugees in the camp. The tragic fire in Ma Tau Twenty years ago could easily be repeated. A few days ago, a camp manager discovered a refugee woman cooking medicine in a windy place, and immediately stopped her and informed her of the camp's prohibitions. As a result, a dispute arose between the two parties. The manager, in a moment of anger, disregarded the law and beat the woman's back with a cane. He was subsequently dismissed from his position by the authorities. The woman later left the camp and reported the incident to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station.</p>
<p>Beaten Pregnant Woman Shows Bruises</p>
<p>She then returned to the camp and went to the medical clinic to ask a nurse to examine her injuries. It was found that there were indeed bruises on her back, but they were very minor and would not have serious consequences. A few days later, the woman left the camp and returned to her hometown. The truth about the second unfortunate event is that麻包 sacks in the emergency refugee camp were discovered to have been stolen. The refugee who stole them was caught and sent to a senior officer for review. Later, a camp manager beat the refugee and then released him. The manager was also dismissed for this. A few days later, the refugee also left the camp and returned to his hometown. There are currently eight hundred refugees living in Jin Tian. The authorities have advised them to return to their hometowns and provided them with three days' worth of food for the journey. However, they are reluctant to leave. If there were indeed cases of abuse in the camp, they would have left as quickly as possible. Why would they linger? The chief administrator of the Jin Tian camp is a senior Chinese health official who is trusted by the authorities. The Emergency Relief Committee has also sent two officers to the camp to manage all welfare matters. Camp regulations strictly prohibit corporal punishment. If anyone receives complaints about the camp, they can report them to the camp administrator or the Director of Medical and Health Services, who will conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Barely Recovered, Yet Abused Again</p>
<p>An appeal to all sectors of society from all the refugees in the Jin Tian Refugee Camp: We are all very sorry that this time ××is rampant, leading beasts to invade the south, and successive fall of various places, and is extremely destructive. It is unspeakable what pain it is for the refugees who have no home to return to, are displaced and have nowhere to rely on. Fortunately, the Hong Kong government and our central government have shown mercy, and Chinese overseas and philanthropists in Hong Kong care about their homeland, are concerned about their hometown, which has suffered a great disaster, and have donated generously and enthusiastically to provide relief, and have set up places to take us in, so that our thousands of victims can rest and avoid freezing, starving, and being exposed to the elements. The refugees are all grateful for the benefits they have received and sing praises of virtue. Therefore, we are lodging in Jin Tian refugees, meaning that we rely on food and accommodation and settle down temporarily. But after the shock of the soul, we are met with endless pain, grace is received from the top, but abuse is inflicted from below, which is unusually cruel. The managers in the camp are worse than prison guards. Although there is no lack of food and accommodation, the torture is worse than that of prisoners, causing the refugees to act abnormally, and both laughing and crying are sins. Recently, it has become more and more fierce, such as mean abuse, cruel tyranny, all kinds of actions, it is impossible to list them all. We have selected a few things below, please note for future investigation</p>
<p>Pregnant Women About to Give Birth Beaten Mercilessly</p>
<p>Donated clothing, etc., has seen thousands upon thousands, except for the severe winter, when a portion of the Huo ones were selectively distributed, the remainder is still a lot, but those who came later have not been given a shred, but its storage is full of warehouses, and its intention is not announced, and nothing has been said about sending people out to other places, but whether it is sold at auction is unknown, the meanness of its actions is one of them, a month ago, a female refugee, Ms. Tan, who was many months pregnant, was about to give birth, because she was far outside the camp to boil medicine, thinking it was a case of helping with the delivery in advance, because our countrywomen adhere to old habits, which is not unreasonable, but the person in charge, seeing the woman's actions, chased after her and destroyed the medicine and cooking utensils, and the woman followed her crying, so she was angry, and her ferocity broke out suddenly, and she beat the pregnant woman, causing injuries all over her body, and later she only gave her a dollar, and the woman did not agree to accept it, so she went out of the camp, and they let her go, and after returning to her hometown, the woman died in the womb due to her injuries, and the woman died with her, and it was a tragedy that was never seen before, if you are so cruel, the cruelty of the wolf, this is the second,</p>
<p>Why Is Cooking Medicine Different? Punches and Kicks Are Thrown</p>
<p>The daily two meals in the refugee camp can fill the stomach, but it is inevitable that some cannot finish the meal, but women occasionally buy a little salted fish to supplement it, or if they are not feeling well, they can use soup and medicine to adjust it, but most of the people in the countryside advocate national medicine, and there is no Chinese medicine equipment in the camp, and it is difficult for the refugees to spend money, and they go outside the camp to buy and use it, and they cook it themselves in the open space, which is the most proper action, but the person in charge does not give convenience, and when they see it, they beat and kick them, and they break the medicine utensils, and if they ask for mercy, they use sticks to block them, and the most pitiful thing is that the old, young, women and children all suffer, and the cruelty of their abuse is the third</p>
<p>Accused of Stealing Lunch, Group Beating</p>
<p>Now, it has become more and more common to recommend it, to check that there are many people with good and bad things in the camp, which is a common example of natural selection, and on March 29, at 9 p.m., the refugee Yang Cai, who had not been familiar with the crime, was accused of taking a small hidden bag, and the person in charge of the office did not ask for proof, and the group of people beat him violently, and for a while, punches and kicks were thrown, and he was beaten to the point of serious injury and vomited blood, and they still did not stop, and continued to beat him, and then drove him out, and it was heard that he died near Jin Tian Village, and died due to his injuries, and this kind of action, the use of torture, and the murder of people is cruel, and its wolfishness is more cruel than × people, this is the fourth,</p>
<p>Toes High and Imposing Will</p>
<p>To check that the staff in the camp, most of them are careless, frivolous and violent, disregard morality, are poor and mean, and do not know what the country and nation are, so they are arrogant, and regard the refugee camp as their ancestral hall property, and for the sake of relief, they all have to look up to them and be happy with them, and their toes are high and imposing, which is even more official, and in their minds they think that refugees are local hooligans and rotten, and they arbitrarily impose their lewd power, In fact, they are only servants in front of our refugees, and their personality and status are not related to our good refugees at all, and as for their actions, this is the fifth, the above few points, the facts are all there, the refugees dare to ask for conscience, and they are confident that there is no deception or fabrication, but the group is angry and cannot be silent, and they are forced to express their feelings, and the rights and wrongs are clear, and the Chinese officials from all walks of life should be able to discern, and they hope that all the officials will be able to discern and pity our refugees who have suffered a catastrophe, and pity our refugees who are displaced and give them improved treatment, so that they can correct their wrongdoing, and this is what we are asking for, All the refugees in Jin Tian Refugee Camp are respectfully,</p>
<h3 id="e33">Melville, a Strong British Man Stationed with the Chinese Navy, Appointed Commander of the Fifth Fleet; Rear Admiral Holland in Charge of Yangtze River Naval Affairs; Commanders of British and American Fleets Meet in Hong Kong <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>In view of the dangerous situation in the Far East, the British naval authorities have not only dispatched more warships to the East to assist in defense and strengthen their naval strength, but have also recently appointed Rear Admiral Melville as Commander of the Fifth Fleet of the Chinese Navy, in order to share the burden of Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Noble. Rear Admiral Holland, the original rear admiral commander, is responsible for British naval affairs on the Yangtze River. It is understood that Rear Admiral Melville was originally the head of the British Royal Naval Signals School and only became a flag officer this spring. In the North Russian campaign of 1919, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his special merits. In addition, Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, went to Nanyang for inspection and returned to Hong Kong on the morning of the 6th of last month aboard his flagship HMS Kent. HMS Encounter, which went to Singapore to participate in the war, also returned to Hong Kong with him. It is reported that Admiral Noble returned to Hong Kong this time to meet with Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the American Fleet in the Far East. It is said that the two men discussed general issues in the Far East when they met in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Late at night on January 4 of this year, a tragic incident occurred in a thatched cottage in the Akau area of Lok Ma Chau in the New Territories. Huang Zhong (41 years old), a refugee who fled from Bao'an County to Hong Kong, and his wife Wu Shenliang (37 years old) were brutally murdered. His son, Huang Jiu (11 years old), was also injured. Afterwards, the two murderers fled without a trace. It was not until March 19 that the police authorities arrested the suspected murderer Huang Jinyun at the Guangming Theatre in Yau Ma Tei and charged him with the crime of murdering Huang Zhong. The case continued yesterday morning in the High Court, presided over by Judge McGilligan, who summoned seven jurors: Dama Na (chief), Chen Zhixing, Li Jinchun, He Jinsheng, Feng Zeliu, Zhong Dexiang, and Guo Fen. Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt prosecuted. After the court opened, the defendant Huang Jinyun took the stand to testify. Then Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt stood up to make a statement to the jurors. The defendant's defense lawyer, Luo Dongxun, stood up to address the jurors, saying that he hoped the jurors would not find any suspicious points in the case before judging the defendant guilty. He cited facts to defend the defendant. At around 3 p.m., the jurors retired to deliberate for a long time. They then returned and unanimously found the defendant guilty. The judge then sentenced the defendant to death.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Hong Kong Authorities Promote Prosperity in the Peninsula; Allocate Funds to Build New Roads; Extend Argyle Street Directly to Kowloon City Saigon Road; Major Landowners Invest in Building New Buildings in the Area <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Kowloon Peninsula will become prosperous in the future. Various constructions have been improved step by step. In terms of transportation, the most important thoroughfare is Nathan Road. However, due to the recent surge in population, traffic in Kowloon is extremely congested and road development is indeed necessary. The government authorities have also paid attention to this. Recently, it has been decided to build a new road plan, with a construction cost of 50,000 yuan. Construction has now begun. The new road starts from Argyle Street and extends to Kowloon City Saigon Road. The road leads to Kowloon</p>
<p>Prosperous Areas</p>
<p>Its importance is only second to Nathan Road. After the road is completed, Kowloon City, Kai Tak, Upper Prince Edward Road, and Customs Pass will be connected to Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei by this road. The road surface is wide enough to accommodate four cars. After the road is completed, the traffic between Nathan Road and the eastern part of Kowloon Peninsula will be faster than it is now. At the same time, the car traffic on Chatham Road and Prince Edward Road will not be as congested as it is now. The new route starts from London Road, follows Waterloo Road to Argyle Street, and goes directly to Kowloon City. It is understood that after the completion of the newly built road, the current bus route to Prince Edward and Kowloon City will</p>
<p>Bus Routes</p>
<p>At least two routes will be changed to Argyle Street. One is from the Yau Ma Tei pier to Kowloon City, and the other is from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon City. To continue building Argyle Street to Kowloon City, the small mountain next to Saigon Road must be completely removed. The mud and stones from the mountain have now begun to be excavated and used to fill the beach opposite the Kowloon City Police Station. The development of the Argyle Street area has resulted in the addition of countless new buildings in the eastern part of Waterloo Road. It is said that the tycoon Yu Dongxuan has built 36 new houses there, and the Humphreys Estate Company has also built 18. Across the road is the address of the Kowloon Hospital expansion site. The new buildings of the Li Long Hospital will be built this year, and a mental hospital will be built next to it.</p>

<p>May 1st is Labor Day, May 3rd is the Jinan Massacre, May 4th is the Student Movement, May 5th is the Soviet Revolution Day, and May 9th is the National Humiliation Day. During the above-mentioned days, the Hong Kong police authorities have specially dispatched detectives to patrol the city.</p>
<h3 id="e37">A Glimpse of Shek Kip Mei Village <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Wan</p>
<p>Who says that a civilized city does not contain a backward village?</p>
<p>In contrast - since this is a majestic and brilliant golden island, why should there be a simple and humble village?</p>
<p>- This village is Shek Kip Mei Village, which the locals call Hakka Village. Next to the Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, on the back side of a row of streamlined Western houses and villas; on the wide Pak Pu Road, a small path full of rubble diverges; in the brightly lit night, a pile of crooked and overturned houses are revealed.</p>
<p>Originally, there are several "villages" of different sizes in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is Tai Hang Village in Causeway Bay, and Hakka Village in Castle Peak Road. Besides, are Kowloon City and Diamond Hill not tribal villages? However, here - Shek Kip Mei Village, the impression it gives people is not so simple and vague!</p>
<p>Due to the narrow space and dense population, the houses are small and the eaves are low. In front, there is a muddy ditch full of sweat, and due to the accumulation of feces and the vertical and horizontal pig pens... people are reminded of the concept of "hell on earth" as soon as they step into the village.</p>
<p>Days and nights of wind and rain have swept clean the long streets of the bustling city - however, the entire Shek Kip Mei Village has been swept away by wind and rain, covered with sand and broken countless short trees and low eaves - the fences, their only short bamboos, the pig pens, their only dry stakes, I am afraid that they have been destroyed without leaving anything behind - the suffering of the villagers is what they are like in the eyes of the pleasure-seekers!</p>
<p>The village is piled up and crowded, with about 300 or more families squeezed in. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the farmers here only planted flowers, watered vegetables, and raised pigs and chickens. They worked at sunrise and sunset, renting one or two acres of "rural land" from the "Royal Family", building wooden houses and sheds, and diligently planting flowers and vegetables, and raising pigs and chickens to meet the daily needs of food and miscellaneous grains. There were only one or two small shops selling "groceries and pastries" in the village. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, there were many refugees from the mainland, so the refugees who could not be accommodated in the Western houses began to explore like Columbus. After three to five months, the ladies wearing modern cheongsams were discovered here; Western furniture, which was originally to be placed in Western rooms, was moved in quite a bit. Half a year later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, a large number of refugees from the war zone fled here like bees, and the farmers who had been washed by the city also had to take the opportunity to ask for money. Therefore, the walls at the entrance of the village were already covered with signs saying "Rural Houses for Rent"... Now, let alone the girls in cheongsams, our noble gentlemen actually come in and out of the small mud houses. Architects, they rely on land for food, and they produce a cause and effect of "price" and "value" under the abacus, so they resolutely take the money to buy flat land here to build wooden buildings. Rent or sell, they have created several streets in the backward countryside in a month and a half - what "Yongsheng Lane" and "Kangning Lane". Whether the land is expensive because of people or people are expensive because of land, Shek Kip Mei Village now has a sewing factory with ten or so sewing machines and a wooden shop making rosewood furniture...</p>
<p>However, alas! The refugees are ultimately at their wits' end. In the clear autumn or even the cold and dry winter, they may be able to survive in the forest of "pigs" and "chickens". However, in today's misty spring rain, especially in the last ten days or so, during the storms, the humid atmosphere of the village head, mixed with the steaming stench of pigs and chickens; the sewage ditch of the village. The washing of the people in the sewage ditch... By the time the sultry summer night comes, the scene of mosquitoes gathering into thunder, the suffering of the lives of the people living here can be said to be completely exposed in hell on earth.</p>
<p>Tourists to Kowloon's Cow Island, if you happen to walk near the streets of the village and it happens to be a sunny day, you may imagine a idyllic village like Utopia. However, this is not the case: the village in the big city has no vitality. Besides the rice porridge and side dishes that are carried in loads from restaurants and tea houses every morning, what else do the villagers of Shek Kip Mei communicate with the city?</p>

<p>The tour guide business in Hong Kong has been booming recently. There are no less than a hundred tour guide agencies in Central, Sheung Wan, and other places. The number of tour guide girls in this profession is also over a thousand. The business is quite good. However, due to business relations, it has been condemned by society. People in the tour guide business have presented this problem to the authorities, requesting permission to register and establish a tour guide association to develop the business. It is understood that the petition has been submitted to the Hong Kong authorities for more than ten days, but it has not yet been approved. According to semi-official news yesterday, the Hong Kong authorities are still studying the issue of whether to abolish or retain these tour guide agencies. Therefore, the approval is still pending. However, most opinions advocate the need for existence, but it is necessary to establish regulations to restrict out-of-line behavior. Those who violate this rule will be punished.</p>

<p>The sensational bloodshed in the Tea House case involved the defendant, Li Bingchun, who was charged with murdering the Japanese "Sagara Naomichi" at the Tea House Restaurant at 81 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai, on January 28 of this year. The case was heard yesterday afternoon at the High Court by Judge McGilligan, who summoned seven jurors: Wessica (chairman), Johnson, Won, Walker, Sousa, Goula, and Chen Jintao. Deputy Crown Counsel Wyatt prosecuted. The defendant was represented by solicitor Palama, who deferred to barrister Sielton. After the court opened, the prosecuting lawyer</p>
<p>Stated the Case</p>
<p>Briefly stating that the defendant was a partner in the tea house, receiving a monthly salary of four new yuan, and also owning 75 yuan of shares in the store, so he was also one of the shareholders. At around 7 p.m. on the day of the incident, his younger brother, Li Rong, brought a letter to the defendant. The letter was from his aunt, asking the defendant to send two or thirty yuan back to his hometown for household expenses and for his travel expenses to Hong Kong. When his fellow villager handed the letter to his younger brother, he had told him that the defendant's uncle and younger brother in the village had already been</p>
<p>Japanese ××</p>
<p>His aunt was also raped by the Japanese. Li Rong also took the opportunity to tell the defendant when he handed the letter to his brother. The defendant was extremely angry after hearing this bad news. At 11 p.m. that evening, a Japanese person came to the store for supper. At that time, the defendant was working downstairs. The case then occurred. The defendant entangled with the Japanese person to the oil chicken table. The defendant grabbed the oil chicken knife and forcefully slashed at the deceased. Customer Yang Shaoqi saw this and immediately stepped forward to stop him. The defendant said, "This person has slaughtered and raped my family, so I am retaliating. Don't panic. I will go to surrender immediately," and so on. Then he alone</p>
<p>Went to Report to the Police</p>
<p>On the way, he met a police officer and was taken back to the police station to file a case. The government doctor, Carney, then took the stand to testify. Finally, the photographer testified about going to the scene of the incident to take photos. The court ordered that the case be adjourned until 10 a.m. this morning for further hearing.</p>

<p>It has been a month since Hong Kong held the registration of foreign residents. The original deadline was May 31, but only 1,490 foreign residents have registered so far. According to the authorities' expectations, the number of registered persons should reach 10,000. Compared with the number of registered persons, this number is only 20%, which is very far apart. The registration office is surprised to see the indifference of male foreign residents in Hong Kong to registering quickly. According to an employee of the office, most of the registration forms that have been filled out and returned are filled out incorrectly. The questions in the form must be answered positively. The office has now issued a warning that registration is an obligation of foreign residents and must be fulfilled. Those who do not register after May 31 will be severely punished. If the number of registered persons can fill out the forms and return them to the registration office as soon as possible, it will be easier for the office to organize them. Please ask major stores and foreign firms to ask their staff to fill out the forms as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The continuous heavy rains last week, during this period of water shortage, provided much-needed relief, greatly benefiting residents' water supply. The water authorities will also extend the water supply hours by two hours daily. The general public believes that full-day supply will soon be further implemented, which is also likely to be realized. However, according to a report from the water authorities yesterday, despite the heavy rains last week, the reservoirs in Hong Kong only collected one-eightieth of the total rainfall. Since last autumn, Hong Kong has experienced a prolonged drought, and the soil is parched. Therefore, despite the heavy rain, most of it was absorbed, and only a very small amount flowed into the reservoirs. Thus, although it rained heavily for several days, the amount collected by the reservoirs depends on the dryness of the soil. Last week, the total rainfall was over six inches, weighing 250 million tons, but the amount collected by the reservoirs was only 63.9 million gallons, or 3 million tons. The remaining 247 million tons were either absorbed by the parched soil or flowed into the sea. As of last Friday, the water stored in Hong Kong was only 223.4 million gallons (approximately 10 million tons), a figure that only accounts for one-twenty-fifth of the rainfall from the 15th to the 21st of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Overview of Nanhua College; Decision to Establish School in Chaozhou and Meizhou to Develop Higher Education; President Zhong Luqi to Visit Nanyang Today for Investigation <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>School Tour</p>
<p>Facts tell us: Cultural education, as the foundation of a nation, is the main target to be destroyed by the × people. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, domestic universities have either been bombed or forced to relocate, causing professors and students to wander, and the life of higher education is in danger. Allowing it to be destroyed without construction, and watching it die without seeking rebirth, is a hidden worry for the nation. In order to relieve out-of-school youths, promote overseas Chinese education and culture, and create talents for the war of resistance and national reconstruction, Nanhua College came into being. Tracing back to the history of the school.</p>
<p>On the day after the anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction last year, three famous educators, Lei Binnan, Zhong Luqi, and Lei Tongqun, invited people from all walks of life to gather at the Confucius Hall to discuss the matter. At that time, 28 people including Ren Hongjun, Chen Hengzhe, Zhuang Zeyi, Huang Juemin, Chen Binhe, Chuan Shanglin, Zeng Youhao, and Wang Youjian attended. The result of the discussion was that it was necessary to establish an institution of higher education at this time and place. Famous people in the cultural and educational circles were invited to participate in the initiation and help support it. Therefore, research evolved into reality.</p>
<p>Starting a business is difficult, but with the board of directors generously donating huge sums of money, and President Dr. Zhong Luqi, Professor Lei Tongqun and others working hard, since the school started in the fall of last year, the school's progress has been steadily improving. The school is located in the beautiful natural environment of Lion Rock Road in Kowloon, which is also a good environment for nurturing talents. The current directors of the college are Wang Chonghui, Xie Guansheng, Wang Yunwu, Zeng Youhao, Qiu Gongye, Qiu Yuanrong, Qiu Jiping, Qiu Shen, Zeng Yangfu, Lei Peihong, and Gong Zihong. They are all very concerned about school affairs.</p>
<p>The current main faculty members are: Chairman and Professor Zeng Youhao, President Zhong Luqi, Professors Lei Tongqun, Cheng Jingyuan, Qiu Huajun, Huang Juemin, Li Bao, Cai Zhaoling, Lin Shiyan, Guo Butao, Li Weicheng, Fang Xiren, etc. Secretary and Library Director Wang Yongdai, they understand education and run education, and their spirit of hard work is admirable.</p>
<p>The college currently has three departments: Literature, Law, and Commerce, with a total of eleven departments with four years of graduation, and also offers special courses in Commerce, Political Science, Journalism, Teacher Training, and English, with two years of graduation. Starting from this semester, an affiliated middle school has also been opened, and the scale is gradually expanding.</p>
<p>The college has also decided to establish the main campus in Chaozhou and Meizhou in order to develop higher education in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas. The Hong Kong campus will serve as a branch campus, so that they can advance together. The Ministry of Education has expressed deep sympathy for the college's various facilities and has given encouragement. The filing procedures are said to have been completed.</p>
<p>President Dr. Zhong Luqi is scheduled to set off today to inspect overseas Chinese education in Batavia and the Nanyang Islands to facilitate the development of school affairs. The trip is expected to take place in February.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Fierce Fighting on the Northern Front; Our Great Army Approaches from the South, Crossing Jiangcun; We Adopt a Strategy of Steady Progress, Advancing South Step by Step; × Bandits Routed in Conghua, Leaving Over Two Hundred Corpses <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Northern Jiang Quick Report] The counter-offensive on the northern front continues. Our army is adopting a steady and solid strategy, advancing south step by step. ×, plotting to defend Guangzhou to the death, is constantly reinforcing their troops and plotting against our rebel bandits, so the fighting has been fierce in recent days. The military situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Our Position Consolidated in Front of Aotou and Lion</p>
<p>Since defeating the main force of the × army in Zengcong, the Liang Division of the 12th Army Corps captured important strongholds such as Shikeng Street in Conghua on the 18th, and then advanced along the highway, attacking Shentang and deploying strong positions in the areas of Shiqian Market, Ganhe Market, and Aotou Village northwest of Conghua to prevent the × army from breaking out or harassing. For several days, × has been under our army's control and has not taken any action. Recently, × has transferred more than 2,000 people from Guangzhou's Taihe City, distributing them to the areas of Taipingchang and Shentang. On the 19th, more than 300 × from Shentang crossed the river to harass Mumian Cliff, Mayazhuang, and Jiulianfen, and were intercepted and defeated by our Peng Division's strike team. On the 21st and 22nd, they sent out scouts to probe and search north, threatening to attack Conghua again.</p>
<p>× Bandits Suffer Another Crushing Defeat in Conghua</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd, more than a thousand × infantry, supported by several cannons, advanced along the Guangzhou-Conghua highway to attack Conghua. Our Liang Division sent out troops and engaged in fierce fighting with × in the area near Jiekou and Mumian south of Conghua. × used artillery fire to cover their advance and launched fierce attacks. We resisted and counterattacked, advancing and retreating repeatedly. × was unable to make progress. At noon, reinforcements from our army arrived and joined the battle, boosting morale and bravely killing ×. × could not withstand it and fled in the original direction. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue, and the × formation was in chaos, abandoning supplies along the way and retreating south in a panic. In this battle, over two hundred × were killed and over a hundred were wounded. Our army is currently searching forward.</p>
<p>Our Army Presses South in Xinjie</p>
<p>After our army recaptured Xinjie, it repelled the invading × army on the morning of the 21st. × corpses were scattered everywhere, and they retreated to Jiangcun. Our army took advantage of the victory to press Jiangcun and Gaotang. On the 22nd, it arrived at a certain place north of Jiangcun, surrounding and monitoring ×. A part of the elite troops took a detour along the Guanghua Line to attack Renhe Market. On the evening of the 22nd, a certain unit of our army cooperated with the guerrilla team of the Second District to launch a night attack on Jiangcun ×. They once rushed into Jiangcun, killing dozens of ×, but due to terrain limitations, they automatically withdrew to their original positions. Currently, a part of our vanguard troops has detoured past Jiangcun and is flanking Gaoceng and Dalang. The strike team in the northwestern suburbs of the city is also active, trying to contain the × army's communication. Once all the troops reach their destinations, they will launch a large-scale attack on ×.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Fierce Fighting Still Rages in the Dongjiang; Our Forces Engaged in Bitter Fighting in Luofu Mountain; × Surrounded, Iwata Killed in Action; × Aircraft Wildly Bomb, Breaking a Wing <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Dongjiang Quick Report] In the Dongjiang battle, the contention between × and our forces is still fierce. Our army, backed by the Luofu Mountains, is utilizing mountain warfare and engaging in a stalemate with ×. There have been gains in recent days. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Still Rages at the Foot of Luofu Mountain</p>
<p>On the 21st, × attempted to attack our army's position in Futian Luofu Mountain with more than 2,000 people. They were ambushed in Gongkeng and suffered losses. That night, they reinforced again. On the morning of the 22nd, approximately 2,000 people, a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, supported by six or seven tanks and five aircraft, again attacked our army in Jigungkeng Futian. The attack was quite fierce. Our army calmly responded, and our artillery on Luofu Mountain also displayed its power, concentrating its fire on the target, and fiercely attacking ×. × was threatened by our artillery fire and could not advance an inch. According to military news from the front, × and our forces were still fighting fiercely in the Suzuo, Jigungkeng, and Futian areas at the foot of Luofu Mountain until dusk. × even set fire to rural villages in various places to prevent our army from advancing. On the same day, artillery fire was heard all day near Qishi and Masilongjiao on the south bank of the Dongjiang. The intensity of the battle can be imagined.</p>
<p>× Battalion Commander Iwata Killed in Action</p>
<p>Also, the day before, two regiments of our advance troops, in coordination with the Luo Fengxiang unit of the Third Guerrilla Column, pursued the Zeng ×, surrounded them, and annihilated more than 100 × infantry and cavalry. At that time, the × Battalion Commander Iwata Rokuro was surrounded in the center and could not escape. He was shot and killed. We also seized a batch of × army bullets and guns. On the night of the 22nd, our headquarters, in coordination with the guerrilla team of the Third District, launched a night attack on the × camp in Zhenghe Market northwest of Zengcheng. When they arrived outside the kiln, they lit a fire as a signal. With a command, they attacked from all sides, rushed into the market center, and engaged in fierce fighting with ×. Our army and the guerrillas fought × with broadswords and hand grenades. After about 40 to 50 minutes of fighting, they retreated in different directions along the original route. The night attack was also a great victory, annihilating nearly a hundred × and seizing much.</p>
<p>× Aircraft Wildly Bomb Futian and Suzuo</p>
<p>In this counterattack on Zengcheng, the × army, in addition to relying on its mechanized troops, also relied on its aircraft to bombard our rear and positions in large quantities. After wildly bombing Boluo County on the 18th, at 9 a.m. on the 19th, three × aircraft flew from Longmen and circled over Luofu, dropping 30 large bombs in succession. On the 20th and 21st, three to nine × aircraft also took turns bombing the Luofu Mountain Suzuo area, dropping 40 to 50 bombs. The area at the foot of Luofu Mountain and Jigungkeng were the most heavily bombed, but many bombs fell on the wasteland, and we suffered no losses. It is reported that when the × aircraft attacked Luofu Mountain, our artillery counterattacked with accurate fire. One aircraft had a wing broken off by our fire and descended rapidly, almost crashing to the ground. Then, after tumbling a few times, it limped toward Guangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Our Two-Pronged Counterattack on Xinhui; Rumors that Jiangmen Has Been Recaptured; We Use Mobile Warfare to Exhaust the × Army; Guerrillas Cross the River at Night and Set Fires in Response <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Quick Report] After our army systematically withdrew from Jiangmen Huicheng, it has been taking steady steps and using mobile warfare tactics to exhaust the × army. After several weeks of entanglement with ×, × has become exhausted. On the 23rd, our army defeated the × in Huicheng, and rushed into Jiangmen that night. Yesterday, the 24th, news of victory came from Sanbu, saying that our army had recaptured Jiangmen on the 24th, and the remaining × were being swept away. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Two-Pronged Counterattack</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Jiangfu Road army advanced towards Jiangmen from Tangxia Duruang Jinggen. At the same time, a part of the army was sent out to bypass the new highway and pounced on Shuanglong Tianshang. The × army there only had about 300 people, and its strength was very weak. After being pressured by our army, it retreated to Jiushe after a little resistance. As for Huicheng, after × reinforced from Daliang on the 19th, on the 21st, they sent out more than a thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with 13 tanks and armored vehicles as the vanguard, and launched a fierce counterattack on our army's position from Gangzhou Road. More than ten × aircraft circled and bombed. Our army held the position in the Jinniu Mountain area and engaged in a stalemate with ×, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. On the morning of the 23rd, a large number of our fresh troops arrived and launched a brave attack, defeating ×.</p>
<p>Rumors of Recapturing Jiangmen</p>
<p>Our army took advantage of the victory and continued to advance towards Jiangmen. In the evening, the Jiangfu and Gangzhou armies arrived at the Jianghui Station and Fanluo Zini in the suburbs of Jiangmen. Until late at night, the guerrillas of the Fifth District secretly crossed the river from Hetou, rushed into Jiangmen, and set fires as a signal. Our armies on the outskirts of the city then gradually entered the urban area. The × army was suddenly caught in the fire, and the order was in chaos. Our army bravely charged and killed until dawn. On the 24th, news came from Sanbu that our army had recaptured Jiangmen, and the remaining × were being forced outside Haiwai Street, and a sweep was underway.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Xinhui Refugees Talk; The Plight of Young Men, Women, and Children in Jianghui Under × Military Rule Is Miserable; Puppets of the Maintenance Society Take to the Stage <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>After Jiangmen in Xinhui fell, our military and civilians are now holding positions against the × in the Shadi Zishui Duyuandai area, launching counter-offensives against Jiangmen and Huicheng day after day, causing the × to run ragged. However, in this battle of Jiangmen, the civilians and local defense forces bravely participated and dealt a heavy blow to ×. × harbors a deep resentment towards our civilians and is extremely ×× towards the villagers of Xinhui. Yesterday, a villager from Makeng Township in the Eighth District of Xinhui escaped to Hong Kong and gave reporters a detailed account of the situation in Xinhui and Jiangmen under × military rule, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Refugees Arriving in Hong Kong Talk About ×× at Noon</p>
<p>The villager said that since Jiangmen Huicheng fell, the local defense forces have resisted, and we have nothing more to say. However, the responsible authorities were too calm and negligent, resulting in significant losses for merchants and civilians. In particular, the grain stored in the righteous granary and the rice in various rice shops were not moved in time, resulting in the greatest loss. As a result, there is a great rice shortage in various villages in Xinhui today. Rice is sold for a mere catty per dollar, which is a very serious situation. After the × army occupied Huicheng, they are now stationed in the Dasha Mountain, Xiangshan, and Mashan areas, and have built an artillery position on Da Yun Mountain, with six or seven cannons, indiscriminately shelling the surrounding villages. Because the palm leaf fan piles near the city obstruct their line of sight, they have burned all the fan piles in Huicheng, causing the palm leaf fan industry to lose millions, resulting in huge losses. The × soldiers act ×.</p>
<p>In Huicheng and Jiangmen, young men and women have been cleared out, and there are few pedestrians. The only ones who remain are rascals and traitors in the Maintenance Society.</p>
<p>Ugly Characters and Traitors; Ghosts Come Out in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>A puppet Maintenance Society has been established in Huicheng and Jiangmen, with its headquarters in the Southwest Academy. The puppet chairman is Liang Rong (also known as Zipizhi Rong), who used to collect waste paper in Huicheng. The committee members are Lu Qi (i.e., Lu Dapeng), Liao Lie (i.e., Liao Zhiping, a practicing Chinese medicine doctor), Xie Luyu (a figure from the Ziyue Hall), Liang Yingchu, etc. However, recently, the puppet Maintenance Society members have resigned because they are competing with the × Advancement Army for military pay. The puppet Advancement Army captain is He Pingzhi, and the team headquarters is located in Cen Richu's mansion. All kinds of people are gathered there, and the situation is chaotic, just like a gathering of ghosts. The robbery incidents happen dozens of times a day, and most of them are committed by the puppet army and the puppet Advancement Army soldiers. The public order and security situation is increasingly out of control.</p>
<p>× Army Retaliates and Bombs Suxiong</p>
<p>The villages of Suxiong (Rongkeng, Maxiong, Tianlu, and Changxiong), about ten miles away from Huicheng, have many strong men and weapons. The strong men in each village are supervised by the village chiefs Chen Yu, Jiu Qu, etc. Every night they attack Huicheng. The × army, because of its small number of troops, has been attacked by our strong men and cannot sleep or eat. They are filled with hatred and anger. Recently, they set up artillery in Henan, Huicheng, and shelled the villages, destroying dozens of houses and killing dozens of innocent villagers. They then ordered the evacuation of women and children (because many refugees had fled to the villages when Huicheng fell). The refugees, women, and children all fled by boat to Sanjiang and transferred to Hong Kong and Macao. Unfortunately, one longboat, when leaving the Machong estuary, was hit by a shell, and the whole boat was destroyed. More than a dozen old and weak people on the boat were killed, a truly tragic scene. When the × army invaded Xinhui this time, the local defense forces were brave in resisting, but because political mobilization was inadequate, evil people and traitors were active, which ultimately affected the military progress. It is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Recent Situation in Southern Counties; Prohibition of Rice Exports to Avoid Supplying ×; International People Provide Widespread Disaster Relief <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Southern Route Quick News] Although the counties of Xuwen, Haikang, Taipu in the Southern Route have not been spared from the lurking and harassment of × aircraft and warships, our strength is strong and our defense is solid. Therefore, although the coastal areas seem tense, they are actually relaxed. The recent military and political situations in the Southern Route are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>International Sympathy; Widespread Relief for Refugees</p>
<p>Hepu County has been bombed by × aircraft many times, reaching more than ten times so far, resulting in heavy losses and leaving people homeless and in urgent need of relief. International people, Pastor Bao (German), established the Beihai Refugee Relief and Reception Center on the 30th of last month to carry out widespread reception work. Two more reception centers were established in Hepu County, one in the Jiande Association and one in the St. Barnabas Church, with sheds built to accommodate more than a thousand refugees. He also wrote to the Hong Kong Relief Society to donate food. After the county was bombed, commerce was suspended and it has become a dead city.</p>
<p>Thorough Prohibition of Food Exports</p>
<p>After × occupied the Hainan Islands, the Southern Counties ordered a ban on food exports. It is now found that the people of Xuwen County are still applying to the county government for the issuance of grain transit registration certificates to transport grain to neighboring counties by sea. The authorities believe that the × warships are now surrounding overseas areas, fearing that they will be intercepted midway and used to supply ×. To prevent this, a public notice was issued yesterday prohibiting the export of grain by sea and suspending the issuance of grain transport registration certificates by sea from now on. At the same time, the Haikang County government also strictly ordered a thorough prohibition of rice exports. Those who violate the order will be considered to be supplying ×.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Guerrillas Active in Guangzhou City <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Shameen Communication] After Guangzhou City was subjected to the general counterattacks from our various routes, it has suffered a great blow, and the situation in the city is becoming more and more chaotic. Our guerrillas, lurking in the city, are even more active, and from time to time they gather to attack × camps. In the past few days, our guerrillas have been appearing on various streets, openly carrying guns and wearing armbands. When they encounter × soldiers, they immediately open fire. Therefore, gunshots can be heard in the city day and night. The number of × soldiers killed by the guerrillas every day reaches more than a dozen. Now, most of the × soldiers are hiding and dare not come out. There are very few × soldiers on guard on the streets. Guangzhou City has been virtually controlled by our guerrillas. In recent days, our counter-attacking armies from various routes have approached Guangzhou. In order to prevent the people in the occupied areas from suffering unnecessary sacrifices, the guerrillas have been performing in various restaurants, tea houses, and busy streets to persuade the people to leave Guangzhou as soon as possible to avoid suffering poisoning.</p>
<h3 id="e53">In Shaoguan (2) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Microwave</p>
<p>I am very pleased that, upon arriving in Shaoguan this time, I met many responsible authorities and obtained a lot of valuable materials and instructions from the conversations.</p>
<p>First, I met with our provincial political leader, Provincial Governor Li Hanhun.</p>
<p>In a simple environment with a square wooden table and a few bamboo chairs, I talked to this political leader for quite some time.</p>
<p>As a leader, he puts on his uniform every day and goes to the office during office hours to preside over provincial affairs. The difficulty and busyness of the work cannot be undertaken without a very energetic person. Several friends who used to work with him in the army told me that commanding an army is much simpler than presiding over provincial affairs. The military system is a unified one from top to bottom, so it is not necessary to deliberate as much as a provincial governor when issuing orders. Governor Li is eager to govern, so he is busy every day with how to refresh personnel, adjust institutions, how to establish a sound political system, to meet the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and how to build a new Guangdong, to live up to the earnest expectations of compatriots and fellow villagers at home and abroad. All of this makes him feel much more tired than before in the army, but his spirit of courage is constantly advancing.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, there is the formulation of the Guangdong Provincial Wartime Governance Program. This program "is based on the Three Principles of the People, implementing the Central Government's Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, referring to the resolutions of the National Political Council, and considering the actual situation in the province. For the current stage of political facilities, concentrate political elbows and people's strength, reform politics, develop the economy, and promote culture, in order to achieve the goals of victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction."</p>
<p>Regarding the content of this program, a general outline has been drafted and is awaiting detailed revisions by the Provincial Affairs Conference before it can be implemented step by step. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Reforming Politics</p>
<p>1. Promoting Righteousness</p>
<p>2. Adjusting Institutions</p>
<p>3. Enriching Talents</p>
<p>4. Training Regimental Police</p>
<p>5. Pacifying Localities</p>
<p>6. Popularizing Relief</p>
<p>7. Mobilizing the Masses</p>
<p>(B) Developing the Economy</p>
<p>1. Reorganizing Finances</p>
<p>2. Activating Finance</p>
<p>3. Promoting Trade</p>
<p>4. Developing Industry</p>
<p>5. Rectifying Transportation</p>
<p>(C) Promoting Culture</p>
<p>1. Reorganizing Education</p>
<p>2. Promoting Academics</p>
<p>There are also two new organizations here, the "Political Affairs Research Association" and the "Design Committee," which aim to attract talents, pool ideas for research, and promote provincial political affairs. The Political Affairs Research Association is jointly organized by senior officials of the provincial government and meets once a month to review past work and accelerate administrative efficiency. For the convenience of research, the association is divided into seven groups: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, Construction, Security, Land Administration. The Design Committee is divided into four groups: Politics, Economy, Culture, and Defense. The number of members ranges from seventeen to twenty-nine, selected or appointed by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that the provincial government will soon implement joint office work. It was originally scheduled to start on the 15th of this month, but was slightly delayed due to insufficient preparation. The main purpose of joint office work is to concentrate authority and increase efficiency, with a military significance.</p>
<p>One point that I would like to particularly mention is that the wartime personnel have made much progress in spirit. Everyone is spending their office hours at the office, shedding the previous loose and disorganized "anarchic" state.</p>

<p>Hollywood's standard bachelor, Tyrone Power, got married yesterday. The bride is the world-renowned French actress Annabella. The wedding was held at Annabella's home on Beverly Hills. The best man was Tyrone's old partner, Allan Aumont. The newlyweds are too busy with work to take a honeymoon, which has been postponed to next month. Annabella's real name is Suzanne Charpentier. She became famous three years ago in the British film "Wings of the Morning." She started working in the French film industry at the age of fifteen and gradually became famous throughout France. In 1934, she married the French star Jean Murat, but they soon divorced. As for Tyrone's marriage qualification, it is indeed the first time ever.</p>

<p>"In their mad and violent times, no one can predict the details. We'd better leave here quickly. Tomorrow night they might bomb this place."</p>
<p>"That sounds like it would be exciting."</p>
<p>"Watch a bombing?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she nodded casually, "Bombs thrown into the snow will be as beautiful as spraying diamonds."</p>
<p>"Maybe what's sprayed out will be our flesh and blood. Dear, we'd better get away."</p>
<p>"I can imagine what Paris is like now, just like in 1914. Those lovely soldiers are singing—Forward—Forward. Oh, Archer, I'm so happy to be with you."</p>
<p>"Why?" he asked absently.</p>
<p>"All this vast, miraculous death, and the destruction everywhere, is what you have helped to create!"</p>
<p>"Why don't they die?" Weipo asked roughly, "Who is more sinful, the one who sells weapons or the one who buys them? Irene, I assure you, these killing weapons are too good for those little people." His voice trembled with insult and anger, and he walked out of the room.</p>
<p>That night, Irene returned to the reception room. The travelers were all silent, with uneasy hearts. Everyone knew that tomorrow, this place would be bombed into a desolate wasteland. Harry was also calculating in his heart that he and Irene would have a second parting.</p>
<p>"Why are you always looking at me like that?" she suddenly asked, "You've been looking at me like that ever since I came here."</p>
<p>"Yes, because you remind me of someone who looks like you. Have you really never been to Omber? Mrs. Weipo?"</p>
<p>She laughed and shook her head, "I don't think I know your Omber, but, excuse me, I'm not Mrs. Weipo."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought…"</p>
<p>"I know what you thought," she interrupted, "Mr. Weipo and I only have a professional connection."</p>
<p>"I know," Harry murmured, "A very beautiful professional connection."</p>
<p>"I think you're probably the kind of person who respects Mr. Weipo very much because he sells explosives, guns, and warships."</p>
<p>"Ah, no, I'm not like that, but I would never criticize those who oppose him."</p>
<p>"His business is booming. He sows a little seed of fire here and there, so people always have to buy his goods."</p>
<p>"Naturally, that's perfectly legal."</p>
<p>"Why are you staring at me again?"</p>

<h3 id="e60">Public Baseball Tournament is Coming Soon, China Team's Talent Remains, Other Teams' Strength Has Also Increased <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Paper News] Baseball is a most exquisite and brain-using sport. However, precisely because its organization is complex and its rules are numerous, many people do not understand it and are not very interested. If one understands it, one feels that baseball is more worthwhile than any other ball game.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament is scheduled to begin on the 6th of next month at the Caroline Hill Navy Ground. There are six participating teams. Although there has been no increase compared to previous years, because each team is full of talent and its strength has increased, it can be predicted that the competition will be exceptionally intense in the future and there will be an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<p>The participating teams include the China Team, the South China Athletic Association Team, the Hong Kong Baseball Club Team, the Westerners' Team, the American Ship Mindanao Team, and the Shanghai Brewery Company Team.</p>
<p>The China Team is the defending champion. All the good players will continue to play this year. However, it is not yet known whether catcher Luo William, who is currently at Danxia Mountain, will return. If he returns, he will still hold this position; otherwise, Lin Ye will replace him. The currently planned lineup is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Pitcher: Huang Rongjun; Catcher: Luo William or Lin Ye; First Base: Chen Lunshi; Second Base: Hu Zhengqu; Third Base: Lin Ye; Shortstop: Chen Fang; Left Field: Zhong Cansen; Center Field: Cai Bingfen; Right Field: Lu Jiaxing; Reserve: Huang Guoqing.</p>
<p>Looking at the above list, all are famous generals. The attack and defense will definitely be sharp and strong. In the future, when competing with various teams, they will surely reveal their championship colors again.</p>
<p>As far as I know, other teams have new players joining. Of particular note is the renewed lineup of the Hong Kong Club Team. Because the team has many new players, such as Harris, Brown, Delaney, Vanikia, Bissell, Bielu, etc., all of them are experienced players. In addition, "Fastball" Hissa, who used to be a pitcher at the San Francisco Seals, will also play for the team. If his arm is well, then any team that meets the Hong Kong Club this year will likely suffer a painful blow.</p>
<p>The Mindanao Team's strength was already good last year, but this year it is even stronger, because the ship has many young baseball players who have newly joined from the United States, so their strength has greatly increased and is no longer comparable to the past. Among these people, the most noteworthy are pitcher Luis and outfielder Reagle. They are extremely strong in defense, but their batting is relatively poor.</p>
<p>The Westerners' Team, which won the runner-up last year, still has the same lineup this year, but the experience of each member has greatly increased. Their fast-paced style of play is frightening. The pitcher position will still be held by Adair, with Birella as the backup pitcher in case of need.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Brewery Company Team is this year's new army. It is composed of players who previously played for other teams in Hong Kong, so it is impossible to predict the results. However, from a personal perspective, the strength does not seem weak. The team members, such as veteran Da Li'anna, Xiao Li'anna, Nashalian, Jie Cao, etc., are all fast players. If they are willing to work hard, the future is also promising. (Donglang)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Basketball Game Last Night. Group A: South China Defeats Guangda. Police Suffers Defeat. Taikoo Lost to South China <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In the Open Men's Basketball Tournament, South China played against Guangda in Group A last night. Although South China was once defeated by Sing Tao, their strength is still strong. Guangda hoped to defeat South China and came to the game with an elite team. After the start of the game, Guangda's momentum was remarkable, and they frequently put pressure on South China. In the first half, they took a lead of 27 to 13. After that, South China mobilized the entire army. Huang Zuo shouted and encouraged them, and the three armies fought bravely. Good news came frequently. Guangda was in a state of panic and lost 26 to 43.</p>
<p>In the second game, Sing Tao played against the police. Sing Tao is a strong team in this year's competition, and the police are also very brave. After the two sides fought, Sing Tao cooperated well. Li Peiyan and Lu Zhenxuan played to the point and made many achievements. Li Renjie and Dai Fucheng shot well. Liang Guoduo and Pan Yaojun both had good performances. The police, Na Lianxing and Chen Jinkui, were also good at fighting, breaking through and entering, but Sing Tao passed and attacked, taking care of each other. The police resisted with all their might and finally lost 40 to 54.</p>
<p>In the final game of Group B, Taikoo played against South China. Taikoo's coordination was disorganized. South China's offensive was balanced. Luo Huazhang, Zhuo Hongzhan, Zhuo Guorong, He Hongji, and Mo Dunxiang all made contributions. Taikoo's Guo Ying and Liang Gengchang tried their best to support, and there were some gains, but South China's strength was strong, and Taikoo ultimately had no effect, losing 25 to 57.</p>

<p>[Tong Agency, Rome, 23rd] The Italian Open Tennis Singles Final was held here today.

<p>The Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament resumed yesterday. Veteran He Jialiu played against Xu Runpei. In the first set, He's power was brought into play, and in one breath, he beat Xiao Xu to cope with difficulty with a score of 4-0. In order to open the difficult situation, Xiao Xu stood up, pressed and attacked together, and the situation improved. He won with a score of 7-5. In the second set, He Jialiu jumped too much in the first set and walked too intensely. His vigor declined. The young and vigorous Xiao Xu seized the opportunity to kill, serve sharply, and get on the net properly. He won a complete victory with a score of 6-0 and was promoted to the week to play the semifinals with Li Huitang. Xiao Xu's performance in the first half of the first set yesterday was extremely abnormal. He made serving errors, and his shots fell into the net. He was violently killed by He Jialiu's high pressure. As a result, Xiao Xu's ball skills were one notch higher. He used both softness and hardness to break He's hard work policy. Therefore, the old and strong He Jialiu inevitably lost.</p>

<h3 id="e68">The Sport that Chinese People Should Have in the All-Out War of Resistance <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Falu</p>
<p>After the launch of the all-out war of resistance, it is very clearly placed before us that there are only two roads. One is to bow down and obey, to give and take, to only follow, and to never recover, and to die in darkness. The other is to rise up and seek survival, overthrow the invaders, lift the constraints, and achieve freedom and equality and bright and brilliant life. A person, a person without a heart to do good, I believe will never be willing to abandon the road of life and take the road of death.</p>
<p>To cut off the road of death and open the road of life, we must concentrate everything and struggle under the same goal of fighting for survival. Whether we can achieve the goal depends on the degree of struggle. At present, the struggle is multifaceted, mobilizing the masses, arousing the feeling of anger towards the enemy, developing resources, consolidating the economic foundation, negotiating, winning the world's assistance, teaching young talents, continuing the lifeline of the country, planning and deploying, making decisions in the tent, charging into battle, killing the enemy on the battlefield, and everything done for the war of resistance are all struggles. However, although there are many ways to struggle, in summary, there are only two ways: mental and physical labor. In other words, it is mental and physical strength. As the Western saying goes, "A sound mind is in a sound body," and abundant physical strength can only be produced from a sound body. Therefore, to have a transcendent spirit and majestic physical strength to enrich all the forces of struggle and achieve the mission of victory in the war of resistance, training a sound physique is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Exercise is a tool to severely refine the sound and strict body, which is recognized by all in ancient and modern times, and there is no need to say much. However, under the current situation of launching an all-out war of resistance, what kind of exercise should be used to train the physique of the whole people to cope with the current great disaster is worth our review. In my personal opinion, the most suitable sports at present must meet the three principles of "economy" and "easy to learn" and "easy to do". The reason is: (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The current football competition has reached the end of the tea and flowers. Many people will temporarily hide in the mountains like leopards, waiting for the cool autumn in September to meet the fans again.</p>
<p>However, the ball fate is broken and continued. The more concerned, there are still two ball accounts that have not been clearly settled. One is the First Division League runner-up decisive battle, and the other is the Xuhe Cup championship battle.</p>
<p>The East team will return from the South to apply. They arrived during the day. In order to complete the procedure as soon as possible, the General Association has set the date for the runner-up final at 4:30 pm on the 29th of this month. The location is Caroline Hill.</p>
<p>The East team has returned from a long trip, and has gained a lot of experience. They have also added two "external" players, Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting, to their strength. The momentum is very strong. It is not difficult to defeat the Navy in one battle and win a runner-up seat. Don't say that bezoar and canine cases are not precious enough.</p>
<p>The Xuhe Cup championship battle is a matter for South China and the Navy, but whether our China team can handle and package the six major championships depends entirely on this final move. Thinking about it, the concern is doubled. I only hope that the generals of South China will take good care of themselves and complete this glorious creation.</p>
<p>This competition will be held after the Philippine International Team returns, but the battle date has been set for May 13th. The location is the Standard Supplementary Ground. This final autumn wave is enough to be missed. (Taisui)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Backstroke <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yeshao</p>
<p>Most swimmers are not familiar with backstroke. A detailed examination shows that the reason is not that it is difficult to learn, but that it is not as lively and cheerful as other swimming styles. When saving drowning people, backstroke can be useful. Freestyle is the fastest way to get to the drowning person's location. To drag him to the water's edge, backstroke is the most convenient. Both of them lie supine in the water, and rescue work is easier to carry out. Not to involve too much, the most troublesome thing at the beginning of learning backstroke is that the limbs feel particularly stiff.</p>
<p>There are also many types of backstroke movements. The most agile is to alternately kick downwards with the lower limbs, with both hands crossing over the head and entering the water forward. This swimming posture is similar to freestyle, only the direction of the body is opposite. Because the direction of the movement is different, the posture of the limbs coming out of the water and entering the water is also different. When kicking with the lower limbs, the toes must be slightly inward. This foot posture can increase the area of ​​impact with the water and enhance the power of the floating body. Therefore, the head can also be raised a little higher, so that the position where the hands can exert force to paddle is suitable. The upper limb movement of freestyle is to push downward and backward, which is a crawling movement, while the upper limb movement of backstroke is very similar to rowing. The position of activating the water is similar, but it is slightly different from the upper limb movement of breaststroke. In addition to the opposite direction, the hands and feet come out of the water and go in again. However, they both move to both sides, which easily makes the body sway from side to side. If the force applied by one of the limbs is large or small, and because the backstroke posture cannot see the front, the direction of the continued backstroke must be skewed. It is not difficult to correct the error, just pay attention to the uniform use of arm strength.</p>
<p>Another type is to raise both hands away from the water at the same time, cross the head, and insert them into the water forward, and then pull them towards the sides of the waist to get out of the water. The kicking action of the feet is like breaststroke, so those who have learned breaststroke find it very easy to learn this action. Only when the hands pass over the head, the waves of water raised by the arms will prick at the ears, mouth, nose, and eyes, making them uneasy, especially hindering breathing, and continuing to exercise will be exhausting. However, over time, the so-called difficulties will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The method of turning around in backstroke also needs to be studied. According to the swimming rules, when backstroking to the side of the pool, like freestyle, you are allowed to touch the end of the pool with one hand. Once you touch the side of the pool, immediately take advantage of the forward momentum of the body to turn around. At this time, hold the side of the pool, and the pool wall is touched by both feet. Facing the side of the pool, throw it backwards. This posture facilitates breathing and can also take the opportunity to rest the muscles of the limbs. Another turning method is to use the strength of the soles of the feet to push the pool wall through the body in the water, and then come out of the water again.</p>
<p>The back movement can also stretch and float easily without much effort, but it is not as easy to last as breaststroke. For the improvement of swimming skills, the backstroke movement is quite complicated and is worth practicing carefully.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Problem of Balancing Commodity Prices <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>(4) High Commodity Prices and Wartime Economy</p>
<p>Generally speaking, commodity prices and the purchasing power of the people are mutually causal. When commodity prices rise, national income increases, and consequently, the people's purchasing power also increases. If commodity prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, national consumption will naturally shrink, causing commodity prices to inevitably fall until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. However, this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and even then, it cannot be fully realized in practice, because wages never rise in the same proportion as commodity prices. Therefore, high commodity prices only weaken the people's purchasing power and rarely have the possibility of increasing it. Consider the table below: The average wage of factory workers in the 27th year only increased by 1.8% compared to the 26th year, but the cost of living for workers at this time had already increased by 29.4%. This is a clear fact.</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Living Expenses and Wage Index for Shanghai Workers</p>
<p>Year 26 Year 27</p>
<p>Worker Living Expenses Index (1) 124.11 160.60</p>
<p>Factory Worker Wage Index (2) 100.00 101.80</p>
<p>Currency Purchasing Power (3) 80.57 62.27</p>
<p>(Note 1) Figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office. (2) Wage index, calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" in the January issue of the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Institute of Economic Statistics.</p>
<p>Moreover, our country's production is already extremely backward, and now it is in a time of war that is destroying all production equipment. Therefore, high commodity prices, on the one hand, reflect the decline in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand, strengthen the power of foreign goods to exploit our country's wealth. In other words, it is enough to promote the collapse of our country's finances, finance, currency system, and the entire national economy.</p>
<p>On the surface, the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in selling foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign goods as raw materials and sellers of finished products, etc.) may also increase to some extent, thereby creating a superficial prosperity in bank deposits. However, it cannot compensate for the loss of monetary value of other wealth capital, let alone the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.</p>
<p>From the perspective of facts, the high rise in domestic commodity prices has already made the entire population feel a severe threat to their lives. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands further, there is a danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the United Kingdom provided a loan to China to jointly balance foreign exchange. If we disregard the political significance and only analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its market for goods exported to China." In other words, because commodity prices in China have already exceeded the level of purchasing power, making the market for their goods in China face a major obstacle in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in the import prices of Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Moreover, our reason for attaching importance to this issue is less for the present and more for the future. We must first plan for "preventing problems before they occur," because the main reason for the current soaring commodity prices is due to the impact of the war. Therefore, in the future when there is still no hope of ending the war, that is, in the future when all the reasons that stimulate soaring commodity prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be an unlimited risk of further increases.</p>
<p>(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Commodity Prices</p>
<p>The National Government has long been determined to control commodity prices during the war. However, this control is still in the trial stage in European and American countries with extremely well-organized economic systems. Germany's "appropriate price system" is praised by the world, but in China, where the economic organization is like a plate of loose sand, there is really no room for imitation. However, the fact is that it is no longer permissible to let it go on like this. If we can remove the speculative factors in commodity prices, we can balance the situation and solve the problem easily. Therefore, recently, the provincial and municipal governments were finally ordered to organize commodity price balancing committees separately, and to cooperate with provincial and local banks to implement price balancing for people's daily necessities, and to stipulate three types of fair price standards: (1) For goods whose production and transportation costs are slightly or very slightly affected by the war, the average price of the three or one and a half years before the war shall be the standard; (2) For goods whose production and transportation costs are affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be the standard; (3) For goods whose costs are not easy to calculate, the total amount of capital required for their operation plus a considerable profit shall be the standard. It is also stipulated that the goods for balancing commodity prices are limited to daily necessities.</p>
<p>The commodity price balancing committee is jointly organized by the local government, existing banks, or local banks, and chambers of commerce. For industrialists, merchants, or individuals who hoard large quantities of daily necessities, the committee may request the local主管官署 to force them to sell them at the assessed price. It is also stipulated that those who violate the following clauses with the intention of speculating and manipulating shall be reported to the court in accordance with the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations: (1) The amount of mutual buying and selling between companies in the same industry shall not exceed the actual amount of individual goods; (2) Companies in the same industry that do not deal in daily necessities shall not mutually buy or sell futures on the market; (3) No exchange or market shall be established for the purchase and sale of daily necessities.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the entire economy and is the place where speculation is most rampant and commodity prices rise the fastest, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area. Political power can no longer exert much effect. If it is not for the people to come forward and govern themselves, it will be simply impossible to implement. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be freed from the improper reduction and cruel oppression of commodity prices depends only on whether the leaders of various industries can contribute and support and work hard on this point.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Stablehand Wang Afu <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zairong</p>
<p>Outside the courtyard where we lived was a stable, and one of the many stablehands was called Wang Afu.</p>
<p>He was short with a sallow complexion, in his thirties. But his eyebrows were always furrowed, as if he had some unfathomable worry. His movements were very restrained. When he spoke, he was always overly humble, revealing his peasant nature everywhere, unlike a "foreman."</p>
<p>He often wore that set of gray cotton military uniform, and the leggings were also put on improperly. Sometimes his handkerchief was worn askew. He had nothing except a small dog. That small dog was a Japanese breed, captured by a brother when we attacked Zhangdian. He wanted it. He was very strange about that small dog. Sometimes he was very protective of it, not allowing others to touch it. But sometimes, he would beat it mercilessly until it barked and howled, while its owner showed his two rows of yellow teeth in a sinister smile.</p>
<p>The small dog often ran into our courtyard, and he would come in to get the dog. But a group of teasing servants would take the opportunity. One would hold the small dog, and the others would surround him, asking him to sing: "Sing! Sing, Old Wang!" The chaotic noise, mixed with the small dog's barking and howling. He was obviously embarrassed. However, people saw his embarrassment and did not sympathize with him. Instead, they pressed him even harder, shouting, "Sing! Sing!" laughing louder and without restraint. So we came out to watch this most exciting act. He would delay for a while, but when he saw that this delay had no effect, he had no choice but to sing. But when he stood in the courtyard preparing to sing, people made even more demanding requests. "Shake your butt! If you don't shake, it won't work." At the same time, someone in the crowd would take out his own handkerchief and hand it to him. He had no reason not to accept this request. He had to take the handkerchief and sing in the courtyard, twisting and turning while straining his throat.</p>
<p>Then, "This slave lives in Baoding Prefecture..." The sad tune continued until the color of his face gradually changed, and his eyes were filled with tears. In the end, his voice became hoarse and his tears flowed down. Only then did people satisfy him and release the small dog, letting him go out. But after a while, it was the Japanese-breed small dog's bad luck. The barking and howling reached my ears, and then we heard Wang Afu beating the small dog again.</p>
<p>I saw such things three or four times. I sympathized with him very much and disagreed with the servants' teasing, but I didn't know why he was often sad, often sang that sad song, and often beat that Japanese-breed small dog.</p>
<p>It was a windy day, and that act had just been performed in the courtyard again. I couldn't bear it any longer. I called a servant into the room and told him not to do this again in the future. He agreed and then said, "Afu is also pitiful..." Obviously, he knew the inside story. I asked him about it, and he told me the following story:</p>
<p>"Mr. Jin, don't underestimate Wang Afu. He was originally a big landlord. Before the Japanese devils invaded Baoding, he still had a manor, several hectares of land, and a lot of property. He had a wife and a younger sister. When our army defended Baoding, I met him. He lived in a village south of the city. But he made the wrong decision. We asked him to donate money, but he didn't. We asked him to do something, but he didn't do it.</p>
<p>"When our army withdrew from Baoding, people scattered. The commander and I were the last to leave, but we saw that his family was steaming snow-white steamed buns and slaughtering a big pig. I wondered what trick he was up to. Who knew that he was preparing to welcome the Japanese x x!</p>
<p>"When the x x arrived, they didn't give him any special treatment. It is said that the pig was eaten, but the steamed buns were trampled to pieces. His wife was spotted by a Japanese devil, who immediately wanted to take her away. However, how could he let the Japanese devil take his wife away? So they fought. The Imperial Army could easily subdue an unarmed Chinese man. But the Imperial Army seemed more interested in 'saigu' (Japanese for sexual intercourse) than in killing people, so they took a civilized action towards Afu, tying him to a wooden ladder and then dragging his wife onto the kang. One, two, three... Perhaps he closed his eyes at the time (it is said that Wang Afu did close his eyes), but he could clearly hear his wife's struggles. He could also clearly hear the muffled shouts, and the devils who climbed onto the kang were six or seven...</p>
<p>"Late at night, the house was silent. Wang Afu finally fell to the ground with the ladder. When he woke up again, he found that another Imperial Army soldier was untying him. This Imperial Army soldier was not particularly kind. He probably knew that he was a big landlord, so he wanted him to point out where the gold was hidden. However, no gold was found, but his younger sister was found instead. Two cold bayonets were pressed against him, forcing him to watch his younger sister being climbed on by one, two, three Imperial Army soldiers.</p>
<p>"He wanted to resist several times, but the cold bayonets were pressed against his chest, and he didn't dare to move. However, he never dreamed that under the pressure of the cold bayonets, the last one to 'saigu' with his younger sister who had fainted on the ground was himself!</p>
<p>"He almost went crazy. After suffering countless gun butts from the Imperial Army, he was still not dead, so he came west with the refugees.</p>
<p>"Before the fall of Taiyuan, our troops arrived in Taiyuan. They found him in the refugee camp. He didn't give me a chance to laugh at him. He hugged me and cried, telling me about the above experiences..."</p>
<p>"So, he stayed here as a stablehand," I interjected. The servant agreed with me and then left. I completely understood why he always frowned, sang such sad songs, and often beat that Japanese-breed small dog.</p>
<p>After those inhuman beasts stepped into our country, such stories were played out everywhere they went, and thousands upon thousands of people suffered hardships. Wang Afu's experience is just one of many ordinary stories! But this is the humiliation of the nation, and we must not forget these ordinary stories.</p>
<p>In order to prevent those ordinary stories from continuing to be played out in various places, our soldiers are raising the banner of upholding justice. I hope that in the near future, the same banner will be raised in the East across the sea. This is my blessing to those who are fighting for justice and peace in the island nation. Their shoulders also bear the responsibility of preventing those ordinary stories from being staged!</p>

<p>— Qiming</p>
<p>It's raining, very annoying! But I know the rain will stop, as long as the wind changes direction, the sun will come out.</p>
<p>I'm sick, very painful! But I know I'll get better, as long as I seek hygiene, I can soon regain my health and be happy to be human.</p>
<p>The country is being bullied, very difficult! But I know the bullying will pass, as long as we resist together, strive to build the country, we can soon have a bright and brilliant Republic of China.</p>
<p>Everything in the world, all things in the universe, has a certain order, a certain track. Loss of order is war, deviation from track is disaster. One cannot say that there will absolutely be no chaos and disaster, but after all, this is temporary. Order and track will eventually exist forever, never to be destroyed. Compared to the temporary, what does the eternal count for!</p>
<p>We see, we see from afar, behind the dense clouds that bring rain, isn't there still the sun shining? In the hidden place of the groaning and twisting body, isn't there still a whole and vigorous physique supporting it? Also, in the depths of the disintegrating country, isn't there still a majestic and vast national soul invigorating it? Our hope is not in vain, and the time for its realization is not far away!</p>
<p>Let us work hard, neither despairing nor impatient, all the misfortunes will be like a nightmare, soon to disappear without a trace, when the light of dawn arrives!</p>
<h3 id="e76">On Leader Worship <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Bailou</p>
<p>It seems that someone once said that every young person should have a central figure of worship in their minds. We often say that someone is a thoughtful person. In fact, all people have thought activities, so to particularly point out that someone is a thoughtful person actually means that that person's thoughts are organized, not the scattered thoughts that ordinary people share.</p>
<p>For a person's thoughts to develop to the point of being organized and systematic, they must go through various developments, experiences, and a gradual enrichment of knowledge. But there must be an indispensable element: figure worship. However, it is not idol-style figure worship, but rational and scientific figure worship.</p>
<p>If a person's thoughts tend towards organization, no matter how curved the development process of their thoughts may be, they must have a certain degree of type. What determines this type is someone who leads their thoughts to unfold in a certain direction. Although this someone does not exist in our thoughts at the beginning, when thoughts develop to a certain degree, such a person will appear in our minds, progressing with the advancement of thoughts. Our confidence in this certain person gradually deepens, eventually leading to a psychological worship of them. Only when the evolution of thoughts reaches such a stage can our confidence have a certain destination. Only figure worship derived from the thought process is worthy of being called scientific figure worship.</p>
<p>Some people strongly oppose the idea of hero worship. These people's views focus on the saying that the times create heroes, while ignoring the role of individuals in history. The reason why a person becomes a hero, becoming an object of worship for certain groups, is of course determined by the person's various circumstances, but the main reason is that the person's character can synthesize the essence of their era and embody it in their lifestyle and way of thinking, thus becoming a great person. The reason why heroes become the center of admiration for the masses lies in this. The reason why leaders are different from the general masses is that they can fully grasp and utilize the environment. Although they also rely on the promotion of the masses, the determining point of this driving force is still concentrated in them. Leaders and the masses are an organic whole, inseparable from each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that the general masses' worship of heroes is idol worship. They have not gone through a process of ideological understanding. But we believe that the general masses directly recognize their leaders through intuition in real life. They recognize from real life who truly seeks their welfare and who truly guides their lives. Therefore, although their form of hero worship is close to idol worship, it is actually based on real life. Sometimes a hypocritical leader can also receive blind support from the masses for a time—as in the case of fascist countries—but soon in real life they can recognize the leader's true colors and overthrow them.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading Dong Xianguang's Theory of Chiang Kai-shek and a biography of Lenin, I couldn't help but think of the madly emotional masses around the Xi'an Incident, and at the same time imagine the Soviet people who never stop admiring Lenin's remains in front of his tomb throughout the seasons. The fact that the Soviet Union has today's strength and that China has been able to achieve today's great unity, cooperating with one heart to fight against the war, we cannot underestimate the significance of hero worship and leader worship.</p>
<p>In order to enrich our thoughts and shape our personality, we should all have a central figure of worship in our minds. This not only enriches our faith in justice but also gives us a lot of comfort in the spiritual field at all times.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Villagers (Continued) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Green</p>
<p>The men in yellow wanted to rest, so Guo Laoer led them into the largest hotel, Huang Longyuan. The owner, Huang Guansan, and his family hurriedly escaped through the back door, leaving only two old shop assistants to attend to them, carrying out two jars of wine to invite these foreign "honored guests" to drink.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the young men and women in the town had fled, leaving only the old and the young. Because they had received too many lessons, they already knew how to conduct themselves.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, so of course they could go back, and more importantly, they had to go back. So the staggering footsteps, carrying the drunken men in yellow, walked out of Huang Longyuan.</p>
<p>Guo Laoer gave advice to the leader again, saying: Returning like this would inevitably be laughed at by the "bandits," and they should also be given some punishment. The leader listened to him and did two things:</p>
<p>First, set a fire, starting with Huang Longyuan. While burning, Guo Laoer spoke to his fellow villagers, old and young:</p>
<p>—You are harboring "bandits," so you are being punished. If you do this again, we will kill every last one of you!</p>
<p>Second, Guo Laoer wrote a notice that was neither clear nor coherent, and posted it on the bridge pillar in the middle of the street, saying in essence:</p>
<p>...We have already gone to the countryside, where have you hid! Come out if you have the guts!...</p>
<p>They returned safely to the city in the dim twilight, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Guo Laoer was greatly rewarded by the commander, who said that he handled things thoughtfully and efficiently, and immediately promoted him to "police chief."</p>
<p>Guo Laoer's elation can be imagined.</p>
<p>The next morning, Guo Laoer followed his usual habit, going to the Yongchun teahouse on the west side of the old "county government" to drink tea and have breakfast. Because he was so excited, his face was beaming. As soon as he sat down, he told the waiter and the people at the neighboring tables many things, praising the "benevolent governance" of his master, and announcing his grand policies after taking office as "police chief." While he was giving his grand speech, someone walked outside and, seeing him, bent down and said to him in a heated tone:</p>
<p>—Chief Guo, someone outside wants to ask you to do something. Please come out and meet them.</p>
<p>Guo Laoer looked at the person, and it seemed to be a neighbor he recognized, but he couldn't remember the name.</p>
<p>—Can't you ask him to come in?</p>
<p>As he said this, there was a somewhat uneasy look on his face.</p>
<p>The person moved forward another step, whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>—The person has a confidential matter, and if Chief Guo helps, there will be some gratitude, so it is not convenient to say it here.</p>
<p>When Guo Laoer heard that someone wanted to thank him, his expression immediately eased. He stood up and followed the person out.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was already someone waiting at the door of the teahouse. As soon as he saw Guo Laoer come out, he stepped forward and raised his hand, saying:</p>
<p>—Sending Chief Guo home to the dogs—</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a popping sound from the raised hand, and Guo Laoer fell backward, a stream of blood flowing from between his eyebrows, covering his face and the ground.</p>
<p>The people in the teahouse ran outside, ran in all directions. The person who had asked Guo Laoer out and the person who had raised his hand also ran among them. Before long, no one knew where these two people had run to.</p>
<p>The "police" arrived and picked up another note in front of Guo Laoer's chest, which read:</p>
<p>...We have come to the city to eliminate these traitors who act as accomplices to the tiger...</p>
<p>Then, the city gates were closed, and a house-to-house search was conducted, causing chaos and unrest. As a result, it only stirred up trouble within the city walls. Moreover, it was a matter of 'birds flying into the sky, where can hunters find them!' (End)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Manchurian Snow <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>He smiled, tacitly agreeing. He thought</p>
<p>'Why do you ask again'?</p>
<p>'Did I hurt you'?</p>
<p>He still smiled. Tacitly agreeing, as if also saying;</p>
<p>'If it wasn't suicide, does anyone hurt themselves? If you didn't hurt me, did I hurt myself?'</p>
<p>'Is it serious'?</p>
<p>He silently pulled out the collar of his shirt, which had been dyed red with blood, and showed it to her. She glanced at it, then looked at his face and said:</p>
<p>'Why are you so cold to me? I feel like I'm talking to a deaf person. Won't you forgive me yet?' (Forty-seven)</p>
