<h3>建立遠東反侵略陣綫問題</h3>
<p>英法美蘇等民主和平國組織反侵略陣綫的運動，自從羅斯福總統發表和平宣言和蘇聯採取積極讚助行動以來，已有相當進展。但是　和平不可分割」，遠東侵略者的猖狂一日存在，則歐西反侵略運動亦一日不能成功，於是擴展反侵略陣綫到遠東」的呼聲就此日益高漲。</p>
<p>連臼電訊證明，建立遠東反侵略陣綫，已被提出爲目前爭求世界和平的主要議程之一了。十九日英首相張伯倫在下議院答某議員責問時卽已宣稱「英國將請中國及其他遠東國家加入反侵略陣綫一事，，大有可能」；（二十日海通社倫敦電）十九日英外相哈立法克斯亦在上院宣稱「英國隨時準備參加羅斯福所提之國際會議』，（一一十日美聯社倫敦電）並謂「安全談判將包括遠東在內」；哈氏報告又說：「英蘇談判現正進行，可望包括太平洋問題」。（二十日海通社倫敦電）此外我國駐英大使郭泰祺十八日會見英外相，曾談及反侵略陣綫擴大至於遠東方面之可能性問題。（中央社廿九日倫敦電）而我國駐美大使胡適亦於十九日晨謁美總統會商遠東一般局勢。（二十日美聯社華盛頓電）。</p>
<p>建立遠東反侵略陣綫，和建立歐洲反侵略陣綫，實際上是同一事件。也同是民主和平各國目前要求保障民主政治與世界和平的唯一路綫。從我們中國說。誠如郭泰祺氏本月十九日談話，「中國爲國際政治道德及民主政治而堅决抗戰，已使軸心集團之遠東夥伴，忙於應付，不暇多顧，今日中國實不容稍爲退縮，否則世界之秩序，定必更爲紊亂」！這句話同時也是我們二十餘月的抗戰事實。這事實證明中國早已成爲反侵略陣綫中最忠勇的一員，我們今後也只有更忠勇的奮鬥中爭取自己國家民族的解放與世界和平。同時更證明民主和平各國只有堅持支持中國抗戰，才能眞正展開組織反侵略陣綫運動！</p>
<p>郭泰祺大使所說「今日中國實不容稍爲退縮，否則世界之秩序定必更多紊亂」，一方面是對於世界民主和平各國的忠告，相信昨天抵渝的英大使寇爾氏必爲最了解這個眞理的一人，而將對中英兩國友諠及遠東反侵略陣綫作更大的努力。另一方面對于國內少數主張「反共」「和平」的妥協論者投降份子，則爲無情的打擊，它證明中國决不能在一個更紊亂的世界中獲得眞正獨立與和平，它更證明中國堅持抗戰必將獲得國際上更大更多的助力。</p>
<p>我們今日的任務，就在擴大國民外交活動，協助政府，力促英美法蘇各國實現進一步的合作，團結所有民主和平各國，建立與擴大反侵略陣線，首先對侵略者實行有力的制裁，進而謀求集體安全眞正和平的實現。同時，我們必須加倍努力打擊反侵略陣線前途的阻碍、尤其是對於降×份子的反共和平妥協等等言論行動，要進一步予以澈底的制裁。</p>
<h3>告生活教育社同志書（二）</h3>
<p>— 陶</p>
<p>爲生活教育運動十二周紀念而作</p>
<p>就我實地所觀察，中國是走上了勝利之路。三民主義是成了全域共同信仰之主義卽成了領導中華民族解放之最高原則。抗戰建國綱領也是正確的國策。衡山會議議决之方針如民衆重于士兵，政治重于軍事，後方重于前方及游擊戰重于陣地戰都是幫助抗戰建國綱頓實行之有效途徑。蔣委員長對于近衛聲明的駁斥一方面是指出抗戰國策之堅决，一方面是粉碎×人之陰謀。在第三　參政會閉幕詞裏，蔣議長特別闡明民主政治之要義，尤足以保證抗戰必勝建國必成之信念。這是在政治方面所表現的進步。軍事方面，游擊戰，運動戰，陣地戰綜台之全面抗戰已經展開，最可寶貴的是我所遇見的將領士兵，人人都抱有抗戰到底的决心。經濟方面，各種重要工業在內地是漸　的　　復興起來。輕工業合作社也已逐漸展開，最可喜的是有不少新　程帥之出現，沒有水泥鋼骨也能建立起工廠，法幣的基礎是仍然穩定，×人使盡千方百計還是據不動。人民方面所表示出來的，如趙洪文國之三代打游擊，曾大娘之送子從軍，台兒莊兒實唱歌團之化小漢奸爲小戰士，華僑之長期捐輸，小販發動之義賣，足見人心未死，中國必興，這些事實與現象都證明中國是在勝利的大道上闊步邁進。</p>
<p>同時，日本國內反戰分子漸多，政府爲要鎭壓反戰勢力之興起而益趨向法西斯化，在前綫日軍是士無鬥志，壓戰心理濃厚，所造做傀儡時遭中國志士毀滅，偽軍多反正，佔領之據點被我游擊隊截斷，聯絡不易。×國際市場受抵制日貨的威脅，日漸縮小，現金爲抵捕軍需入超，將要枯竭，我只能大略說說，證明日本帝國主義是愈戰愈弱，必有支持不住之一天。國際方面亦逐漸發生於中國有利之發展，英美間本有難以調和之矛盾，但近來亦有商約之訂立，俾經濟矛盾得以減少，使其對遠東政策可以由平行行動而漸趨于合作。美洲是門羅全義之家鄉，近年來是被德意日撒下納粹法西斯的種子造成侵略的細胞，美國感到極度不安，最近召集汛美會議目的在取得美洲各國諒解互助以共同抵禦侵略，倘美國減少內顧之憂則對于遠東問題，自能採取更有效之行動。蘇聯本其和平政策，對中國抵抗侵略，自始至終是十分同情，所以他對于國際聯盟個別援助中國之决議是忠實執行。起初各國親日派大放謠言說中國接受蘇聯幫助是趨向赤化。殊不知蘇聯與中國皆爲國聯會會員國，依照國聯决議接受，是其本身。現在德意日的侵略陣線拉得更緊，將來的趨勢，英美法蘇和中國的反侵略陣線是有結成的可能，卽使結不成功，他們的平行行動也是于中國有益。</p>
<p>我們只須看一看上面所說的便知道教育者責任之重大了。一，怎樣才能使全國人民鄱了解三民主義？信仰三民主義？二、怎樣才能使全國人民知道戰抗建國綱領，擁護抗戰建國綱領，實行抗戰建國綱領？三、怎樣才能喚起全國民衆使他們發出比士兵更大的力量？　四怎樣才能使個個老百姓都知道蔣委員長駁斥近衛聲明之要點？五、怎樣才能使全國老百姓都很快的得到民主政治的訓練，而成爲民主政治的柱石？六、怎樣才能使全國的老太太都得到趙老太太曾大娘的精神？七、怎樣才能使全國的小孩都有台兒壯兒童的認識？八、怎樣才能使×人佔領區域之老百姓都有民族意識，並使偽政權不得成立？九、怎樣才能使×人前線士兵及國內民衆反戰勢力增高以鎮壓消滅其侵略之氣焰？十、怎機才能使全世界反侵略遝動發生效力以制裁侵略國之行動而粉碎他們擾亂和平的陰謀？這些可以說都是教育問題。由此可見教育者責任之重大。我們在這重重疊疊的重大責任逼迫而來的時候，舉行我們的十二週紀念，是非常有意義，不容我們有絲毫的懈怠。</p>
<p>在這個値得紀念的日子，我的腦袋裏浮出來一個最鮮明的印像是；一羣靑年丟掉了文憑的眷戀，從學府裏跑到鄉下去，和農人共生活。光陰過得很快。這已經是十二年前的羅　斯了，這一羣靑年所帶去的不是文化的賑濟品而是一顆虛心要探尋眞正適合中國向前進取的的教育。</p>
<p>這些靑年和農人接觸之後，雙方都有了驚奇的發現，靑年們在學府裏受教已久，手無摶雞之力，只拿得動一支筆兒專幾行字，他們下鄉不多時，便發現自己也有手，可以做工，可以種田，可以實驗，可以使槍桿。農人呢，在「民可使由之不可便知之』的空氣生活了幾千百年，久已被裹頭布裹得不能思想，他們和靑年知識份子接觸之下，禁不住的要喊出來，「我們也有頭腦呵！」靑年發現了自己有雙手，才是能坐而言，也能起而行，農人發現自己有頭腦，才能由瞭解而信仰三民主義并發揮出力量來以爭取中國之自由平等，這種雙手與頭腦的重新發現是極重要的收穫，應當在紀念的時候特別指出。</p>
<p>我們在這十二年當中幹了些什麼事。三件事，還沒有做完。一是反洋化教育。二是反傳統教育。三是在半殖民地半封建的國家建立爭取自由平等之教育理論與方法。</p>
<p>（一）反洋化教育的用意並不是反對外來的知識。我們對于外洋輸入的眞知識是竭誠的歡迎。但是辦學校一定要蓋洋樓，說洋話，用洋書才算是眞正的學校，那可不敢贊同。有些洋化教育家沒有抽水的洋馬桶是幾乎拉不出屎。尤其是沒有工業的生產而他們要工業的享受和化費。中國是個窮國，那能禁得起這樣的浪費，在這一方面浪費，在另一方面的教育便沒有錢辦了，結果是成了少數人的教育。</p>
<p>（二）反傳統教育也不是反對固有的優點。我們對于中國固有之美德是竭誠的擁護。但是「滿朝朱紫貴，盡是讀書人」的升官教育，以及「爲教書而教書，爲讀書而贖書」的超然教育，我們都是反對的。至於一般老百姓，「出錢給人讀死書，自己一個大字也不識」的現象尤其不能緘默。</p>
<p>（三）建立爭取自由平等的教育原理方法．我們之所以反對洋化教育和傳統教育是要開闢出一條大路讓這半殖民地爭取自由平等的教育可以出來。三民主義是我們的工作的最高指導。從一個半殖民地半封建的國家變成一個自由平等的民有治民享的國家是要軍事，政治，經濟，教育幾方面配合得好才能達到目的。教育方面必定要具備幾種條件才能負起這樣偉大的使命。（一）教育必須是戰門。教育不是玩具，不是裝飾品，不是升官發財媒介。教育是一種武器，是民族人類解放的武器（二）教育必須是生活的。一切教育必須通過生活才有效。抗戰健國的生活才算是抗戰建國的教育。（三）教育必須科學的，這種教肓是沒有地方能抄襲得來的。我們必須運用方法，根據客觀情形繼續不斷把它研究出來。而且，這種教育的內容也必須包含並着重自然科學興社會科學。否則不能前進。（四）教育必須是大衆的，把一個半殖民地半封建的國家變成一個獨立國絕不是少數人所能辦成功。我們必須教育大衆一同起來負担這個偉大使命。但是希望老百姓都得到這教育必須有三條件：一要省錢使無錢的老百姓可以受到教育；二要省時間，使沒空閒的老百也有能求學；三要通俗，使沒有受通教育的老百姓也能瞭解，而感到興趣。這樣一來，若不運用「卽知卽傳的原則，便不能達到老百姓都受教育的目的，而且老百姓所受的教育是要集體的施行。集體才是力量。個別的教育還是一盤散沙，不能發揮出充分的力量。（五）教育必須是計劃的。我們要有一個勸的計劃，使人力財力，都有一個緩急輕重的總分配。從　　民地半封建到自由平等之境要有一個繼續展開的教育計劃，逐步的引導我們前進。</p>
<p>在這十二年當中，應客觀環境的需要，我們發動了四個教育運動，卽鄉村教育，普及教育，國難救育，戰時教育，這四個運動只是一個運動的四個階段，這一個運動便是生活運動也可以說是從半殖民地牛封建渡到自由平等的國家的教育運動。</p>
<p>現在要問：我們今後應該做什麼？怎樣做？</p>
<p>一、繼續已往的工作。偉大的抗日戰已經把化洋教育，傳統教育弄得站不住脚。新的教師在茅草棚和山洞裏沒有黑板粉筆也能辦教育。這是多麼可喜的現象啊　但是教死書，死教書，教書死的教書匠和讀死書，死讀書，讀書死的駐書虫還是很多，守知奴也沒有完全變化過來。文化買辦還在總棧。學校內外的洋八股，老八股：文八股，武八股，宣傳八股還沒有肅淸，文化痞塊是長在都市。鄉下是害了文化貧血症。缺課的要拚命的補。補課之後就得吃補藥。窮苦的天才是被埋沒。到現在還有人反對戰時需要的戰時教育。他們是藏在百年大計，基本學術的盾牌之下。時常發出違背民族生存之歪曲言論。我們要爭取抗戰的勝利建國的成功是必須把這些毛病改正過來。我們對于這些病證是不應該消極的批評而是要積極的幫助改正。</p>
<p>二，負起當前的任務。我們當前的任務是展開全面教育以配合全面抗戰而的面爭取全最後。勝利。我們要把教育展開到前方，展開到邊疆，展開到×後方，展開到華僑的所在地，展開到全世界凡是有×人鬥爭的地方去。別人不願意去而是應該去的地方。我們都得分道揚鏢的去。我們要把三民主義送去，把</p>
<p>國綱領送去，把蔣委員長告全國國民書及較斥近銜聲明的訓詞送去，把蔣委員長對全國教育會議的訓詢送去，送到每一個人的心裏，還要在毎一個人的生活裏行動上衷現出來，去粉碎×人挑撥離間的陰謀，破壞×人所造的偽政權，揭開×人滅亡我們民族的野心，消滅×入可能得到的一切外援，增高×人壓迫下的民衆反戰的情緒，化除集團間的夙怨政見誤會所引起之磨擦，啟發整個民族對于抗戰建國之瞭解，加強整個民族對于抗戰建國之團結，堅定整個民埃對于抗戰必勝，建國必成的信念。我們不應該把別人的力量小看了，連老太太，孩子們都是同陣的戰士。我們也不應把自己的力量小看了，當一個小學教員不僅是三四十個畢生的導師，倘使培養學生卽知卽傳，是很容易的影響三四百人。他的地位的重要是好比一個作戰的連長，或營長。當一個小學校長，不僅是一兩百學生的導師而是一兩百戶，二兩千人的導師。他的地位的重要是好比一個作戰的團長。當一個縣教育局長，不僅是幾百個學校，萬把學生的導師。而是一個幾十萬民衆的導師。他的地位是好比一個集團軍的總司令，甚至是一個戰區的司長令官。但是倔使你小看了自已的崗位，小看了別人的力量，小看了生活教育的卽知卽傳，工學團等等原理，你便成了一隻孤鴉，一個光棍，由渺小而悲觀，徘徊，妥協，×人一來是不堪設想。有許多人是把大事小做了　最重要的是我們要認淸我們任務之重大。此外隨身要帶的還有兩樣東四：一是　線；二是燈籠。一件衣服破過了，是可以越破越撕，越撕越破，到後來是可以撕成粉碎。惟一的辦法是遇着破綻便立刻用針線把它縫好。當這民族的生死關頭。是不容有絲毫的裂痕，一遇破裂就把我們的針線拿出來。燈籠是照着人認淸路線向前走，不只是照着自己而且是照着同行的人向前走，走入自由平等之境。</p>
<p>三，加強我們的力量，爲着要繼續已往的工作和負起當前的任務，我們必須增加自己的力量，否則是不能勝任的。第一，學術便是力量。我們要提高學　的研究。曉莊研究所之建立伸是希望對于抗戰建國的重要　被忽略的問題，加以研究，以求解决而幫助增加抗戰建國之力量。此外，我希望我們每一個同志都要抓着一個問題繼續不斷，百折不囘的去研究它，不得到解决不止。同時，對于中國，對于×國，對于世界也要努力取得正確的認識。我們所教的小孩的集團也要時時刻刻的求進。第二，組織便是力量。生活教育社已經成立，這是一個喜訊。季平同志說得好：生活教育社是一個教育界的大家庭。他是教育思想者的全體，又是教育運動者之　體，又是教育工作者之團體，又是培養教師的團體，又是一般人學習生活和知能的團體，又是一個共同生活體，他又說：他是應該大衆化的，大家共同生活；他應該是工廠化的，大家分工合作；他應該是學校化的大家互教共學。我們對于這些話都同意只是培養教師的團體要改爲教師進修的團體，並且互教共學之下要加卽知卽傳。傳統學校化是不夠的，我們必須即知卽傳才能跳出自己小籬笆，其實，整個的生活教育社應該是二個大的工學團，辦教育是我們的工；研究問題是我們的學；共同過有組織的生活是我們的團，我們即是　根據三民主　教導民衆小孩，那末，我們自己的組織就必須民主化。不但總社要民主化的組織，而且分社，共學服務團的組織都得民主化。第三，行動便是力量。我們要在抗戰建國的行動上發揮我們的力量而且增加我們的力量。蔣委員長說得好：「戰時生活就是現代生活。現在時代，無論個人或社會，若不實行戰時生活。就不能存在，就要被人淘汰滅亡。這是多末正確的眞理啊！俊我們的說法：戰時生活便是戰時教育。我們要以行動的戰時生活來增加我們的力量。</p>
<p>增加我們的力量是爲着要在三民主義最　原則及蔣委員長領導之　幫助　取最後之勝利。讓我們大家把整個的　命戲出來，幫助打倒日本××主義並確造我們的獨立平等幸福的中華民國。</p>

<h3>上海各教會於非常期間之工作</h3>
<p>— 珍</p>
<p>教會在滬地設立的歷史，已有九十年之久，最　的教堂，築於鄭家木橋。九十年後之今日，情形變遷極大，現在上海教堂數目達七十餘，其中有五十七教堂係屬正宗，教友數目達一萬人。</p>
<p>各教會之聯絡由於上海傳道會負責，聖經之出版出售及贈送，總會設於香港路一五八號，至於普通宗教文學總出版處則設於博物院路一二八號廣學會。此外滬地教會尚有廣播電台之設立（呼號XMHD週波七六〇），每日播音七小時，內容除講道外，尚有世界各國及國內宗教新聞之報告及音樂等。</p>
<p>前歲八月間，滬戰爆發，滬地我國基督教領袖，鑒於救濟工作迫切之需要，曾發起一聚餐會，邀請居滬中外教友一，商討對於　兵難民之救濟。彼時英美各國政府屢次強迫僑民返國，而出席此聚餐會之外籍教友仍出意料，因之形成基督徒之聯合陣綫。上海基督教聯台會救濟事業之組織於此時成立。</p>
<p>聯合會成立後工作成績顯著，滬戰開始後難民遍地，聯合會立卽開始募捐，並成立十八處難民收容所，收容難民數目約十五萬人，辦理難民之衣，食，住，爲時已七月之久。難民尋得生計後卽自行離所，最後僅餘難民二千二百餘，集聚於第十八難民收容所，設立於赫德路昌平路，餘留者爲四百人，唯此時性質較前不同，難民多自食其力，聯合會給以相當之津貼。此外聯合會並設立一肺癆療養院，專爲惠肺癆之難民居住。</p>
<p>戰區倉猝不及携帶衣服，同時生活問題之收容所外之難民亦由聯合會予以相當救濟，慕爾堂及婦女自治會負責大都縫紉工作，根據慕爾堂週年工作報告，已製就之棍褥，棉被，臥單達一千一百三十床，衣服拾二萬玖千六百拾六件，彼等現仍繼續工作，去秋滬戰天氣漸寒，聯合會贈送兵士之棉背心爲數極多。</p>
<p>上述收容所外之難民食物問題，聯合會曾於七個月中，由慕爾堂救濟卅萬人之糧食。</p>
<p>關於傷兵之救濟，滬戰時聯合會負責辦理傷兵醫院數所，其他傷兵醫院亦直接或間接獲得聯合會經濟及人力之上幫助。受重傷之兵士，給予特別飲食。所有傷兵，均給以友誼上之安慰。靑年基督徒多數自願前往充任看護之職。傷兵出院後，輒來書懷念其所獲親切之看護。</p>
<p>各傷兵醫院關閉後，某西秠基敦教醫師建議於上海國際紅十字會開設一殘廢傷兵醫院，專事收容失腿悁之兵士。此醫院成立於去年一月十日，院址係舊有之第十七號傷兵醫院，傷兵總數爲四百零三人，醫院中爲之裝配假腿假臂，使之行動，無職業者則教以生活技能，使其出院後不致流浪街頭。此中多數兵士，尋得生命之新精神後，自願作基督信徒者爲數甚多。</p>
<p>救世軍於滬戰時，由於上海國際紅十字會經濟上之幫助，設立難民收容所數處，一在西愛咸斯路，自戰爭開始至今，收容難民一萬三千人，第二收容所設立於交通大學，於七個月中收容難民一萬七千人，此外於小沙渡路　第三收容所，收容難民七千人，並設有難民肺癆病院，給與特別看護。</p>
<p>對於無家可歸的孤兒，救世軍收留之，教以縫工，織　，製鞋，木工，及製造其他日用品手工藝，已售出二千餘元。多數收容所中作工之難民。均已獲有技能，用以維持生活，彼等出所後曾聯合出資，捐助救世軍約八十元，用以表示彼等之感激及謝忱。</p>
<p>關於傷兵與難民之教育，基督教聯合會曾視之爲救濟工作中一種主要工作。醫院中漸愈之傷兵及各收容所中之難民，均給以普通教育，同時並授以職業教育，以期難民離所後，得以維持生計</p>
<p>南市居民歸去者甚多。房屋十九被焚毀，多拾取破碎瓦礫築牆以禦風霜。教會有鑒於此，自去歲三月，組成普益工藝社。上海國際紅十字會收集舊衣破襪，送往該處，由彼等廢物利用，製成各種實用品出售。並設施診間以濟貧病。由西籍醫士祖任義務工作。更鑒於兒童教育之重要，幼稚園及工人子弟課室乃相繼成立，又因難民之營養不足，乃製造豆漿以補充之。</p>
<p>最近此般難民，於頽墻殘壁瓦磔斷磚之下，尋闢肥沃土壤，墾植各種蔬菜以謀生。</p>
<p>工藝社中每日工作者二百餘人，求助之人則盈千累萬，多數難民衣食無着，奄奄待斃。工藝社中又苦於無資多收工人，某日，社中徵求自願退職，以　與更貧困者工作，某老翁捐助八日所得工資八角，彼所有者僅此八角耳，此項組織極有擴大之必要。</p>

<h3>朱德將軍談堅持華北抗戰</h3>
<p>— 克寒</p>
<p>十八集圑軍（卽第×路軍）總司令朱德昇任第×戰區副司令長官的消息，疾風掃地似的，很快的傳遍了全晉　南，傳遍了整個華北。千萬張嘴熱烈的談論着這事件、千萬顆心爲這一珍貴的消息而跳躍，歡　，并感到無限的安慰。記者聞訊特趕到十八集團軍總司令部向這位堅持華北抗戰將近兩年英名赫赫的朱穗將軍致賀，并探詢關于華北抗戰的意見。</p>
<p>目前華北局面</p>
<p>朱副司令長官就在司令部的辦公室裏接見了記者，他的態度、儀貌以及談話的聲調、依然是那樣的質樸，和藹和誠　。當記者提出上述問題時，他首先便頗有意味的微露笑容輕聲地說：『華北今天的局面，是×人當初沒有估計到的。——×人沒有想到我們會在他的後方創造起許多塊抗日根據地，繁殖着這許多正規軍和游撃隊。』</p>
<p>『×人沒有想到佔領了華北交通要道和重要城市，而不能切實掌握整個華北。不但不能利用其傀儡政權統治整個華北，使用華北廣大人力，而且也無法開發華北豐富資源，補充其財力物力之不足。尤其它沒有想到佔領華北以後，會在戰略計劃上受到重大損害。他佔領的幾根鐵道和幾個大城市，今天陷在我抗日根據地和正規軍游擊隊的四面包圍之中，受到不斷的打擊，威脅，襲撃，破壞，並留了五十萬兵力而無法集結，運動去進攻西北和其他戰區——這是他失策的地方。』</p>
<p>朱副司令長官的話頭稍微　頓了一下，接着連綿不斷的說了下去：</p>
<p>『因爲要　補他的過失，値此抗戰由第一階段導轉入第二階段——相持階段的過渡時期，正面主力戰場戰局轉　沉寂的時候，×人便抽兵折囘華北，大舉向華北各個抗日根據地進攻。自去年九月進攻晉察冀邊區開始，晉西北，晋西南，冀中，冀南，魯西北，全華北直至今臼到處都在緊張之苦戰中　；</p>
<p>鑒於過去進攻各個抗日根據地失敗的經騐教訓，×人在進攻方式方面，已經有了若干改變。其具體方式是：首先一掃蕩」平原，剪除山嶽地區的外圍；然後再進攻山嶽地帶圓整個殲滅在華北堅持抗戰的我軍。在作戰上，有兩個特點：第一，是首先佔領鐵道綫附近的　點，佈　好兵力，然後很　重的向前推進，佔領一個地方便修公路，築碉堡，以步步爲營。來縮小我佔領區面積；同時又採取箝形的方式進軍。分進合擊，圖逼我軍在一個地區，一鼓殲滅。第一，是利用快連部隊，以鐵甲車　甲車運兵，遇　卽乘機而入。</p>
<p>此外並注意政治，經濟，文化各方面的陰謀，破壞與欺　。</p>
<p>這樣殘虐，惡毒的進攻，對於華北作戰的部隊是一個很大的考驗。一般素質較差，內部組織鬆懈，政治工作薄弱，對羣衆紀律不好，得不到羣衆援助的部隊，每每難以應付與支持。而指揮員堅决，有靈活的指揮作戰的藝術，戰鬥員英勇，有政治的教育，能切實遵守羣衆　律，有游擊戰爭經驗者，雖然在激戰中難免要受到些損失——甚至是很不小的損失，終依然能在×人包圍中堅持。如×人對冀南平原的掃蕩一，分六路猛烈進攻，冀南平原根據地雖然受到相當摧殘，州始終未能　到其衆殲我主力軍的目的。反之鉅鹿，香城固鉗數次夜戰，使××喪兵折將，受到莫大的損失。今天我軍仍然在冀南堅持抗戰，翼南行政主任公署，依然在冀南行使政權，領導游擊。』</p>
<p>今後華北抗戰</p>
<p>在談釗今後華北抗戰時，朱副司令長官說：『過去的經驗教訓，便是今後　持抗戰　南針。』</p>
<p>黨政車民親密團結，工作密切聯系，是堅持華北抗戰勝　的最基本關鍵。今天華北的確是處在嚴重狀熊中，如果各方面關係不能很協調，各方面工作不能有合理的配合，甚至不以　持作戰爲前提，不能消除磨　，其前途將不　設想。晉察冀區所以能幾次粉碎×人　攻，主要的便是黨政軍民團結一致，所以我把這作爲克服困難，渡過堅持華北抗戰的難關之第一條件。</p>
<p>其次，在於廣泛與探入的動員民衆，組織民衆，武裝民衆。在×後方作戰，羣衆條件更比其他地方重要，民衆的　量是無比的偉大，有了民　，等於有了靠山，什麼都能解决，什麼困難能克服，得不到民衆的幫助，卽使有好的地形條件，還是得不到保障。冀南這一次大戰是最好的教訓。在大平原作戰，在×人的機械化部隊威逼之下，一般人會以爲無法應付，但在動員民衆參戰之下，竟能改變地形，這恐怕是一般人所意想不到的。冀南現在村與村毗連，大平原中到處都是千萬人的手所掘出來的溝道。我們的部隊可以在溝道中蔭蔽着運助迥旋，作爲工事向×人抵禦，游擊，而×人的機械化部隊却失其効能。靑紗帳起，冀南的×人，將會更加困難，由此可見民力的雄偉，用之不竭，取之不盡。在今後作戰中，某種意義上說，民衆要比軍隊更重要。</p>
<p>第二，要提高指揮員的戰術素餐，加緊部隊的政治工作，嚴肅部隊的軍衆紀律。指揮員要善于掌握部隊，　活的使用部隊。戰鬥員要能在政治教育之下，聽從指揮員的指揮，孫子云；「兵不知將，是以將予×。將不知兵，是以國予×」。這句話値得我們全國抗戰部隊的警惕。部隊本身不能上下一心　團結一體，結果會使抗戰遭受莫大損害。不能知已知彼，不知採取主動靈活的游擊戰，與×週旋，爭鬥，同樣也會吃。在×人新的方式進攻下，必需本身素　優良，隊伍堅強，能夠主動的靈活的作戰，才能使×人樸空，甚至深入×背，四面襲×，達到殲滅×人的目的。』</p>
<p>記者於此，又特別提出第×戰區的作戰問題以叩，朱　司令長官又稱：</p>
<p>『第×戰區多山。×人的機械化部隊不易施展，這是有利的條件。×人　將用較大的部隊來進攻幷多用飛機轟炸和散放毒氣，因之今天特別要加強軍民防空防毒的教育，更要努力于破路與空舍淸野工作。本來山嶽地帶行軍作戰已經使×人叫苦連天，我們更要造成其困維。增加其困難。不僅要粉碎×人進攻，使×人不能　取我們物質，而且要殲滅×人，截留×人運入根據地　來的物質。』</p>
<p>『總之，祇要我們有堅持華北抗戰的决心和信心，祇要我們能作到上述三主要點，華北終究是我們的，　北到處　議揚着靑天白日滿地紅的國旗！』地以堅信的語調結束了他的談話。</p>

<h3>×無力渡黃河　西北防務鞏固　國共合作實使人滿意　蔣鼎文將軍談話</h3>

<p>國軍與共產黨之關係、頗爲良好云、記者詢以陝北共產黨特區事、蔣鼎文司令答稱、「十年齟齬、當然不能一旦銷滅、惟目前事態實屬使人滿意、在中央政府心目中、所謂共產黨特別區者、並不存在、吾人鑒於目前環境、容許共產黨存在」云、</p>
<h3>曾仲鳴　被刺的經過　（二）</h3>
<p>— 羅卓明</p>
<p>哥侖街廿七號是　棟合一的房子，汪曾分住着。他們有五個保鏖分配在通廚房的後門，二樓和三樓的各門。夜間尤其戒備得森嚴。他們住宅四週密佈着本地的秘密警察和領事館的暗探。</p>
<p>在廿號到廿一號的那天晚上快到兩點半鐘的时候，住在哥崙街汪宅附近的居民在睡夢中被爆擊的聲音驚醒。最初是一響。短短的靜寂，又是雨響，接着便是不斷的槍聲。最初人們以爲是深夜的爆竹聲，後來聽到兩聲用法語喊叫「救命！」「救命！」才知道是出了非常的事情。</p>
<p>當大家從窗子眺望二十七號的時候，在黑暗中看到閃灼的火光；因爲知道住客的來歷，馬上便明白那是中國暗殺隊正在那裏幹着鋤好的工作。</p>
<p>接着便有一個中國婦人在陽台上用中國話喊叫，不久便有三四個　影跳過圍牆向四方逃散並不斷開槍。這時房屋的換上有人——有人說是汪精衛本人——向逃散的刺客開檢射擊。此外有四五個人由屋內出來追趕鋤奸的人。</p>
<p>曾仲鳴是怎樣被刺的</p>
<p>根據各方面的消息，說他們進去的地方是靠近廚房的空塲，方法是圍墻外邊砌積了一堆磚，由磚堆再攀登鐵絲網的支柱。進到院後，即用　將廚房後門破開。入門後卽用鎗將保鑣的大腿擊中，然後由一人監視梭下，另有二人卽上樓冉甩斧將門斫破，第二樓的保鑣又同樣的被　中大腿。樓上每個房門均被斫破後，才找到曾仲鳴的房間，門一破卽向床上接連射擊，據當時在場者說，樓下監視的人也用槍向樓上轟射，用意大概是防止跳樓。</p>
<p>曾仲鳴夫婦（有人說，曾的妻女來河內還不過四十八小時）的床距離房門大約微靠右側一米達半的地方。當曾被鎗聲驚醒時，急跳出　外，但此時他的腹部和股部已中傷數處，旋卽不支倒臥地上。曾妻的大腿也受了重傷。</p>
<p>當鋤×者認爲曾夫婦均被擊斃的時候，才遵從原路跳出墻外。此事前後只經過廿五分鐘，其舉動迅速的程度實屬驚人！</p>
<p>鋤×者的被捕</p>
<p>當汪宅槍聲傳出後，有人用電話通知警察局，同時哥崙街有四人追蹤，不久卽有一人在河內監獄附近被捕，兩人在伯　街和台下爾街交　處被捕，所以容易被捕的原因，大約是他們徒手逃飲的緣故。</p>
<p>傷者的施救工作</p>
<p>當警察趕至出事地點後即急召汪宅對面的安南醫生Phung　Ngoc　Tue前來救治。醫生來了，曾仲嗚夫婦臥在床上，被褥完全被血濕透。曾的傷勢很重，股部血管受傷，因之流血甚多。三粒子彈打中腹部，其他打中腿部。在痛苦的</p>
<p>扎中曾用法語說：『我需要外科醫生！』並且向醫生說：『我的肚子痛得厲害！…』當醫生要打針時，曾妻卽質問醫生要用什麼藥，經過長時解釋後，才允許打針。但曾腹部仍甚感疼痛，不斷地要水喝。在安南醫生Tue來後十五分鐘，又有一法國醫生到來，由兩位醫生决定將重傷的曾仲嗚夫婦及另外二人抬去醫院。二十一號　上曾腹部及腿部的子彈雖已取出，但流血甚多·腸子被穿三孔。施行手術後，曾的身體非常疲弱，而且腹部繼續劇烈地作痛，口渴得要命。當日下午四時半死於河內拉納桑（Lanessan）醫院。死前尚簽一張五萬餘元的支票給他左右的一人。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>

<p>【路透社倫敦十九日電】利物浦巴洛克里賓　船公后决定一部分航行遠東之船隻、此後將取道南非好望角，而不循蘇作士運河、據該公司職員稱、此舉實爲减省戰事保險費着想、前此由印度及遠東　美之商船、現均改經南非、開來英國之船隻、仍當繼續取道蘇彝士運河、蓋英政符現定該方面之保險費、並不比經南非者昂貴故也、</p>

<h3>英大使抵重慶　激底粉碎×奸和平陰謀！</h3>
<p>英大使寇爾氏已於十九日下午抵重慶，表示這次返渝，祇是處理交外例行公事，並無其他特殊任務。這一事實，對於近日×奸喧傳所謂「調解中日戰爭」的謠言，可算是無情的痛擊。</p>
<p>現在英大使返渝，第一感觸卽是將委員長十七日發表的重要談話，再一次表示中國上下一致堅持團結堅持抗戰的决心，再一次明確指定注精衛及其黨羽同情×首相近衛宣言發動『反共』『和平』，是一種『背×國家民族××全國民衆』的漢奸行爲—這正與英大使過去在江西前綫晉謁委座時所見全體將領堅持抗戰痛斥和平，恰如一日！英大使對於我國上下一致的抗戰决心旣有更明確的認識，則今後對於促進中英友誼及以更大的援華制日工作來展開遠東反侵略陣　運動，必有更大的努力。</p>
<p>無論從國際形勢看或從中國需要看，只有中國的堅决抗戰才有眞正的獨立與和平，也只有中國的堅决抗戰。才有眞正的世界安全秩序。有如郭泰祺大使本月十九日談話所稱：『今日中國實不容稍爲退縮，否則世界秩序，定必更爲紊亂』；因此可以證明×人漢奸一切反共和平調解的陰謀是絕對沒有前途的！他們唯一的結果只是他們的言論行動與他們本身的毀滅！不過目前他們的陰謀毒計必有更兇狠惡辣的演出，而且可能予我們抗戰建國事業與國際反侵略陣綫以相當的阻害。因此我們必須在這時應運國民外交，從國際上的廣泛的運動，予一切反共和平運動以致命的打擊；同時我們還必須加緊展開國民精神總動員運動，提高民族的自尊心與自信心，而以打擊×奸反共和平等言論行動，作爲當前精神總動目的實際工作之一，以澈底淸除抗戰建國和反侵略陣綫前途的阻礙。</p>

<h3>受傷將士在深圳　醫院裡一位英勇戰士談進攻莞城的一幕</h3>
<p>是一個灰黯密雲的天際，陰翳綿綿的春雨，我踏上一條泥濘迤邐的小徑，雨打在泥路上濺起來，把我底鞋襪褲都弄濕了；一陣陣的有力還似無力的東風，把雨吹橫，飄過帽兒邊打在面上；但好容易就跑到深圳一間　時傷兵收容所的門前了。</p>
<p>『我是來訪問那受傷的忠勇戰士的。』對一位年輕活潑的看護姑娘說，她穿得週身整潔雪白的服裝，微笑着迎我進去，她一邊走一邊說：『是的，這一連兩天，香港婦女團體派來了好幾個代表　慰問他們哩。』第一個團體是香港婦　慰勞會，代表是伍艶莊，何予珍，和許宛君，第二個是中國婦女兵災會，代表是劉慶萱，容希蘊，盧之屏等，這眞會使他們——傷兵感到無限地興奮。』</p>
<p>在宏敞的大堂中，臥着六個受傷的戰士，都嚴重的；我想，假如他們不幸而死，却已成仁了。本來，這幾天有百多名負着光榮創痕的兄弟們，從某一個地方運到那裏來的，但天雨淋漓，加以交通梗塞，所以醫藥救援不能够配合急速需要。這點，我知到尤其是我們後方的人對忠勇戰士所感到萬分慚咎的。據說，受傷的人，給雨水淋過就不容易醫洽，我們希望太陽快些兒出現在晴空，好把某地百多名受傷壯士在困難輸運中送到後方的深圳，抑或送到安全的香港來，是的，除了深圳收容所裏幾個傷兵之外，前兩天已經有七個比較重傷的送入九龍醫院了，</p>
<p>我發覺六個傷兵中有一個比較輕傷的壯士，他躺在一角落裏，雙手拿着報紙凝神細讀我終於和他打起話來，他感謝我的慰問和敬禮，還給我追述一囘光榮燦爛的戰績，</p>
<p>『這是一個黑夜，天空朦朧的月色隱約中，還認出田疇裏的樹影，四週沉寂，使得微弱的靑蛙聲顯得響亮，我們百多個弟兄從寮步出發了。啟行前，官長給我們許多激勵的訓話，要我們潛人東莞縣城裏，把×頭顱一個個的殺掉下來，我們終於在九點多鐘的時候，從莞城南門一直進到×人的前哨。</p>
<p>『槍聲兩響，突然把沉悶的四週驚破，我們知到這是我們連長所施的號令，叫我們一齊發衝射過去。』</p>
<p>『×人是措手不及了，我們掃射過去，許久都不聽見還砲的聲音，我們一路向一個目標衝過去，這是×人的隊部呀！』</p>
<p>『十分鐘的光景，×人還槍過來了，我們集中火力掃射過去，不一會兒，那邊再聽不到一聲槍饗，我們終於衝到×人隊部來。呀的一聲，兄弟喊起來啊，他們在鬥前發現一門丈多長的大炮了，黑夜中，我們不能够看出那是什麼樣的炮，但我們幾個人祇想到要把它搬走，可是集合了十來個弟兄們那沒伕移得動。」</p>
<p>『弟兄們繼續前進，大約再過了二十分鐘，前頭×人火力突然密起來，我們知道×人援兵已經趕到來，于是我們就開始退却。但我們是不會忘記×人那門大砲的，立刻拔出幾個手留彈把它炸個粉碎』。</p>
<p>『你是參加此役受傷的嗎？』，我指着他包裹着的傷足，挿進一句問話。</p>
<p>『不，我那天是安全退出的』他連忙給我一個囘答，『我是在寮步受傷的因爲×人過了兩天就大舉進攻我們保安第×團第××連所在地的寮步了，×人這次有三個中聯隊，這場惡戰，延長到五六個鐘頭，我們雖以寡敵衆，但我們打仗根本就慣了。如果說是我們勇敢的話，寧說打仗是我們的家常便飯』。</p>
<p>『經過半天的惡戰後，寮步終歸給我們搶回來喇！』那兵士說了這一個話，把腰伸了一伸，臉孔緊張的態度，馬上失去了。我冉安慰他幾聲，祝他早日復元，緊緊地握了一握他粗大的手！</p>
<p>『是的，我困在這裏太悶了。我要囘到前綫去，醫生說我須再休養些時才可以的話是不對呀！』我在歸途中不斷的感到這位壯士的話的偉大！</p>

<h3>快樂天使　（七）</h3>
<p>哈立驚奇的瞥了她一眼、想到、是他有生以來碰的第一顆釘子、</p>
<p>『雖然如此……我給你帶了點東西、』他將它遞給她、</p>
<p>『什麼、這是什麼、』</p>
<p>『我也不知道這是什麼、不過、它是一件紀念品、看、這上面寫着、『紀念奧末黑』、這就是你立刻要離關的地方、』</p>
<p>愛琳雙手顫動着、接下了這禮物、『爲什麼……爲什麼你送我禮物、哈立、』</p>
<p>他聳聳肩、『我也不知道，這是遠反了我一貫的主張的、愛琳、你是我所看見的惟一使我自己都不能作答的人、』</p>
<p>『也許，我是惟一能使你這樣偉大的人記住的吧、』她温柔的說，</p>
<p>『偉大的人、哼、』他鄙夷的冷笑、『一個偉大的庸人、做每樣事、每樣事都失敗、但是、乖乖、你沒有看到這方面、因爲、你听處的世界、幷不是眞實的世界，那是夢裏的世界、或許、也就因爲這樣、我才覺得你可愛、愛琳、』他說到最後時、眼光直射進她的眼內</p>
<p>不料、她忽然將一隻　手撫摩起他的面頰、『或許、你是錯了、親愛的、或者我們是兩個微賤的人物，微賤的生命、或者、我們是這個瘋狂的世界中僅有的兩個眞實的人』、</p>
<p>哈立向她呆看了一會兒、突然、粗魯的將她拖進了懷內、</p>
<p>車站上的人高喊着要開車了、他倆才從長吻中驚醒、</p>
<p>『看起來、我們只能道別了、』愛琳說、</p>
<p>『是的、你奔你的前程、我走我的路、但是、我有個預感、覺得我們總有一日再會面的、』</p>
<p>『是的、』愛琳低聲應着、他們的唇再度吻合一個無言的道別</p>

<h3>操身健上床的效有最個幾</h3>

<p>（四）俯臥撐運動…如圖、體直頭仰、兩手及兩足尖着墊支撐體重、（一）屈討將全體重量向下壓、（二）伸肘軀體還原、如是、做一至四個八拍、但做時，身體及腿、應保持原有的狀態、切勿彎曲、至于吸呼、亦要順動作之拍節而自然、切勿停止、</p>
<p>（五）振腿運動如圖、仰臥于床上、兩腿挺直斜舉、足約離床墊三尺、兩手祭貼臀旁、頭及肩部亦微離床墊、（一）左足向下擊時、右足向上踢　，如是一上一下、運動至稍覺疲倦時始停止、次數由少而多逐漸增加，該運運動與自由游泳時之腿擊水時略有相同、如習　於此運動時、則對于自由泳亦有補助、（六）屈仲腿運動……屈臂仰臥于床上、兩手指指相組，置于枕骨下、兩腿斜舉、（一）兩腿屈膝如圖的左腿所示、這時的兩膝、愈離得遠一點愈好、但兩足尖反要稍稍接近一些、（二）兩腿用力向外伸直、如圖左腿所示之後，再用力併　如是一屈一伸、卽可獲得下肢及腹部之運動、該運動與蛙泳時之足部動作亦有　同，若習慣于該節運動苔、則對于蛙式泳、亦有很大的幫助、約做一至四個八拍、</p>

<h3>閒話魚翅</h3>
<p>— 乏味</p>
<p>於勸不食魚翅當見　一談魚翅的真面目</p>
<p>魚翅什儿爲舶來品、價値奇昂、　盡人而知之、母庸整述，當海禁初開、來源絕少、於是一般官場鉅賣，互相酬　、筵間需此一篡、以示名貴、及時下已成爲喜慶宴會之常菜，幾乎苟無翅席、未免自覺寒酸、奢侈習俗之栘人、良可慨爲、</p>
<p>翅者、卽鯊魚之鰭也、大別之、爲背鰭腹鰭尾鰭　其質、脊　為優、腹鰭尾鰭次之、論價値、則大片　而小隻廉、凡市間所售、俱己成乾、苟欲烹啖、手續至繁、其先爲褪沙法、以原翅置沸水中煮之、（間或用冷水者　時間較長、）然後起出、刮去外層浮沙、是第一步工作、繼吿完成，</p>
<p>再進爲煮熟，將去沙之翅、重復煮之、以發透糯軟爲度、大概火候之久暫、須視翅身之巨細爲斷、當非內行不爲功、否則、必帶硬性、殊難討好、及其成熟、再入淸水內漂凈、幷剔除硬　與腐肉、但猶淡而無味、喻之爲綫粉、頗覺近以、惟翅為爲韌性而　帶皮、入口肥腴、綫粉反是、乃或有　之不厭、抑且視若珍品、朱免徒尙虛名、不求實在、糜費金錢、豈値得哉、</p>
<p>最後爲調和、卽以熟翅和原鷄汁蒸透、再加一切料理品、如火腿、蟹粉、蝦仁、香菰、菜心等類、按時損益、精良烹製、始成佳饌，實則魚翅本身、本無味之可有、在海禁未開前、徒以其爲罕見之物、遂爲人所稱異耳、</p>

<h3>論革命的浪漫主義</h3>
<p>— 潔孺</p>
<p>現實主義和浪漫主義，這是人類藝術的創作方法底兩條主要的洪流，現實主義是藝術家接近現實，追求現實，並且正確地反映現實的創作態度和方法；而浪漫主義，却是藝術家從他底主觀觀念出發，使客觀現實的藝術表現，傾向於主觀的幻想化的創作態度和方法。</p>
<p>一種藝術·爲了正確地反映客觀現實和把握客觀現實，爲了追求一種最正確帥表現現實的方法，積極地透視現實的本質，表現現實的多樣性，矛盾性，活動性以及發展的必然性，它必須要以那種作爲人類全都藝術史之最高的批判成果底現實主義，來做它的指導創作方法，應甲這科學的　術方法論來冷靜地嚴密地透視現實的各方面，分析現實的諸種複雜的形相，以達到精密反映現實的任務。但是藝術不僅需要對於現實之高度的理性的分析，同時也需要高度的奔放的現實熱情，嬰在現實之中看出着刺激着廣大羣衆的生活感情與實踐意向底熾熱的革命的羅曼諦克理想，要在現實主義的藝術中，高揚羅曼諦克的深摯的情熱，一個藝術家，他不但需要精密敏銳的技術，不但需要現實主義，而且也需要熱烈的情感與靈敏的觸覺，需要浪漫主義，只有現實主義與浪漫主義之有機的融和，才能創造偉大的藝術。</p>
<p>提起浪漫主義（Romanticisn），一般人總易於對它誤解，以爲它只是一種要求於强烈的刺激，痛快的情感，而忽視現實，卑視現實，超越現實的藝術創作方法，其實浪漫主義不一定是反現實的，很多時候，庀是現實之强調誇大的一面，或者是强調現實中底可能的未來的東西的，只有當它被落後的垂亡的人羣應用着的時候，它才是反對現實逃避現實的手段，因此在浪漫主義之中，我們可以類分開如下的兩傾向：一種是頹廢的，消極的，反動的浪漫主義，一種是進步的，積極的，革命的浪漫主義。高爾基曾經說道：</p>
<p>『消極的浪漫主義——　是粉飾現實，使人和現實妥協，或從現實把人拉到沒有任何結果的深淵，拉到甚麼「生之小可解」，甚麼愛，甚麼死等等思　的世界……底謎裏去的；積極的（革命的—潔孺誌）浪漫主義，是加强人們對于生活的意志，在人們之中喚起對于現實底一切的壓迫底反抗心的」。</p>
<p>高爾基以爲消極的頹廢的浪漫主義是直觀的，腐化的，墮落的，是徒然沉溺于個人之內面的狹隘世界和幻滅傷感底泥沼裏的；而革命的浪漫主義，都是進步的，社會的，它强化人們的意志，努力喚起人們對現買及其一切的抑壓底强烈的反抗心。在一般的性質上，浪　主義多少帶有若干不滿現實和反對現實的氣氛，但是這種不滿和反對，是從現實的發展性明白性之透視而來的，，它和現實主義並沒有矛盾，現實主義並不拒絕浪漫主義的成分，它正需要有羅曼諦克的理想與熱情，來照耀歷史現實的動向。革命的浪漫主義，並不是落後階層的那種浪漫主義，是現實主義之本質的一屬性，它是現實主義與浪漫主義的融合，作爲有勝的構成部分而進入於動的現實主義之中的，所以吉爾波丁在關于「社會主義的現實主義」一文裏說，「革命的浪漫主義的特質，是社會主義的現實主義上固有的，只在于不同的藝術家有其程度上的差別」，「革命的作家，應該在各種形式上努力表現進步人羣之鬥爭的目的，讀揚革命的英雄主義。讀美鬥士和建設者，預見眞正的未來和澈底的前路，在社會主義的現實主義的樣式之範圍內，完成其革命的浪漫主義之創造的傾向。」</p>
<p>革命的浪漫主義底基本的特質，乃在於它對于未來性的透視，一切的浪漫主義都是憧憬着未來，帶着「未來」的幻想的，不過那些消極的浪漫主義的未來的觀念，是空虛的，無稽的，直觀的而且幻夢的；而革命的浪淺主義底「未來」，却是從親實之不斷的發展過程，從現實的矛盾及其發展的可能性之中發掘出來，站立在現實的基礎之上的，它具有着十二萬分的真實性，發展性和可能性，是必然能够兌現的未來，革命的浪漫主義之創造，乃根據于現實主題的描繪，指示出那發展，運動和鬥爭之眞確的將來，使之以明朗的色彩活現。</p>
<p>一切偉大的現實主義作家，都是革命的浪漫主義者，現實主義和革命的浪漫主義是互相配合着的，高爾基如下地說過：「對于已爾札克，屠格湮夫，托爾斯泰，果戈理，列斯可夫以及柴霍甫等這些偉大的作家，要判別他們究竟是現實主義者呢，還是浪漫主義者呢？這是很困難的，偉大的藝術家，時常都好像是浪漫主義和現實主義配台着似的」這些話，正說明了革命的漫浪主義和現實主義之間的不可分性，偉大的現實主義者。同時又是革命的浪漫主義者。「鷹之歌」與「暴風雨的海燕之歌」上面高爾基是一個現實主義，但同時又是一個偉大的空想者，因此，它們是互相統一，互相交流的，只有現實主義與革命的浪漫主義的融和，才能賦予藝術作品以高度的感人力量。</p>
<p>今×中國的現實所要求的藝術，當然是這種革命的浪漫主義與現實主義之融合的產物，我們需要批判地接受過去的浪漫主義的積極成分，去創造偉大的革命浪漫主義！</p>
<h3>撲滅火災</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>如果「火」是危險的東西，那末，消滅危險的「火災』，務使其不發生「火災』。這是很正確的舉動，而同時也是大助于世界人類的安全的一件善舉。</p>
<p>可是，「玩火者」是小以爲然的。他認爲「火」之所以會發生「危險」者，因爲世界上原來是有「燃火物」這東四存在的緣故。</p>
<p>所以，「玩火者」認爲用「火」燒去「燃火物」，正是消滅「火災」的唯一的方法。因爲在他的意識中，認爲世界上要是沒有「燃火物」這東西，豈不是『火』自然而然會消滅的麼？</p>
<p>這種「玩火者」的所謂「理論」，令人聽了發生「異感」，原是很必然的。『玩火者」的所以要發出那樣似是而非的怪誕之言，唯一的原因，是要掩飾他的「玩火」的把戲而已。</p>
<p>比如說：希特拉去年併了奧地利，吞了蘇台德區，那時舉世惶惶，于是希特拉這位『玩火者」的聖手，就對英國及全世界發出聲明：他對世界已無領土的要求了！然而「火」究竟是「火」，如果不去撰滅他，而因恐懼他而反去躱避他，那是不行的。因此，捷克又被吞滅了，雖然希特拉也曾經對英國及全世界聲明過：德國不願支配其他民族。「那末捷克不是日耳曼族呀！」然而捷克是「燃火物」啊！</p>
<p>不信，請看他對滅亡捷克怎樣說法？他說：「苟捷克不壓迫德人而爲共產主義之工具，則吾人對於獨立的掩克國，决不有何舉動。「這是希特拉對「防共協定」的履行的一片忠誠，誰都不能說他不是的。雖然有，『防』的『共』產外交部長李　諾夫拆穿這一句話的西洋鏡：「防共協定是地質學上的名詞。」然而世界上最講眞實話的莫過於希特拉與　索里尼了，還有，在遠東宣揚正道的日本，之外，不是「共產主義的工具」，就是「共產主義的自身」了，他們的話難道可以置信的麼？所以希特拉的滅亡捷克，是很正當的，是因爲「余以爲余對於和平大有貢獻，以余已消滅中歐一大危險故也。』這樣。人們還應該呼着上帝來感謝我們的「和平之神希特拉」了？</p>
<p>然而「玩火者」的似是而非的話，雖然曾經歡騙過一些愚蠢的人們過，可是「火」燒到人們的跟前，要不是木石，誰都要跳起來設法撲滅它的。「火一究竟是危險的東西。過去曾經受過「玩火者」的欺騙，那末及今覺悟。選是來得及。爲了世界不再遭受可怕的「火災」，我希望世界上再也沒有一個人去相信『玩火者』的一言一語了吧！</p>
<p>願大家起來撲滅『火災』！</p>
<h3>日出之前</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>誰曾乘過一葉小舟，蕩漾於黑色大海中，長夜茫茫，一粒細小的生命揑緊於波濤，忽高忽低地跟着潮水奔逐，充滿了恐怖，憂愁與希望，而終於在盼　着光明時，看到了水平綫上湧起一輪紅日，冉冉上騰，慢慢兒整個宇宙都變成温暖，這喜悅曾有遜於再生的喜悅嗎？</p>
<p>是光明的喜悅，你說，不也同樣是冉生的愉悅嗎？</p>
<p>雨使人發悶，霧便人愚蒙，夜呢，使人煩躁，誰曾患過失眠症？那怕一月二月也好，一夜兩夜也好，輾轉反側着，在床上，腦筋糾纏着萬端思緒。誰能忍耐呢？沒有太陽，沒有光，也沒有熱，不消說是沒有温情，也沒有歡喜。陷身在黑夜重圍中，人往往是孤獨的，沒有夥伴，沒有囘聲，也許因恐懼的幻影而你驚呼，然而你事後竟又許發覺你曾瘠啞而噤默。</p>
<p>這時有比雞聲更可愛的嗎？在你未曾窺見簿薄的黎明時，而聰明的報曉者巳爲你報曉了。不愁沒有光，沒有熱，沒有歡喜，沒有温情。那往往是一個宰福的佳訊，高高的林梢，抹一層淡淡的胭脂，蒼茫的遠天，透露一層朦膜的魚白，多迷離亦多變幻的海上，映射出魚鱗的金波。</p>
<p>也許你曾受困於噩夢，給她們糾纏着，陷入於險境，窘境，啼哭之境，你窘迫。遇險，甚或你啼哭時，忽然從窻　間透進晨光照在你臉上，涵蓄着無限温情。在半疑半信間，你聽到了報曉的雞聲，終於你毅然的推開了夢。這時，你看到光明的再生，你能不喜悅嗎？</p>
<p>然而，請你想想，爲什麼你不曾給黑夜吞噬呢？你能從新見到光明，你是幸福的，但你爲何欃宰福的呢？</p>
<p>不也有許多人在黑夜中爬行着，喘着氣，又無聲倒斃了嗎？他們從黑夜中爬向光明，像爬一座塔，遙　那塔尖，那陽光，有的歏着氣說沒有力量爬，甘願蹲在黑暗，有的焦躁着不耐煩爬了。他們東倒西歪的，倒在每層角落底裏。有些人是最不幸了，他們耐守了一整夜，與黑夜搏門過不知過多少次。不幸失望了，在夜殘時，漏盡時，將看見塔嶺時。他們給黑夜吞　了，無緣再見陽光。</p>
<p>長夜。使人悲觀。而况又多噩夢，怕黑，更怕黑夜的夢，因此。我們盼望陽光，陽光給我們以歡笑，以溫情。</p>
<p>雖然那祇是柔的光，然而，是光明的淵源。經過長夜的搏　，不曾給黑夜吞噬，我們竟又聽到鷄聲了，這是人間歡欣的第一聲。</p>
<p>鷄嗚了。但曉色還未全開，有些人躱在黑暗中喊着黑暗。日出之前是最令人焦躁的，因爲夜來那慶悠長，甚於子夜，甚於初更。雖說有陽光了，也還有黑暗。而且，日出之前，亦還有許多人被黑暗吞噬。</p>
<p>只有始終找尋着光的人，才能把握住朝陽，迎上前去，眼看那些小醜一一消逝在陽光裏。</p>
<p>鷄嗚了。但曉色未全開。日出之前，你需要忍耐！</p>
<h3>硯</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>那時我剛回故鄕不久，度着隱士的生活，一切違礙的書，早巳丟的丟了，燒的燒了，只剩一本劍南詩鈔還隨身帶着，陪伴我銷磨這痛苦的日子。雨停了不多時，滿院子全是泥水，院子那面炸去的廳房，成了一大片瓦礫場，那碎瓦縫裏也有星星的小草在鑽出頭來。春無處不到，而我的心，却永遠是冬，永遠是沉沉的冬。</p>
<p>孩子一身泥漿，攤開兩手，直撲進來，嘴裏喊：</p>
<p>『瘋子來了！』繞過我的書桌，竄過院子，跳在那一瓦礫上，灑着兩手，向這邊　望。</p>
<p>我站起來迎出房門，一個長頭髮的人跟跟蹌蹌向這邊來，形容憔悴，眼光直視，手裏托着一件東西，航髒的舊棉袍上也濺了泥，向我似笑非笑的點點頭，我略一閃，他一脚踏進書齋，披的一聲，那破皮鞋在地板上擠出一大灘水，他就在門口那藤椅上坐下，捋捋衣袖，把手裏托着的東西舉到眉際，說：</p>
<p>『我來請敎你，別當我是瘋子，咱們是老街坊』額上咀邊，熱氣一陣陣往上冒</p>
<p>我凑近去看他手裏的東西，原來是一隻有蓋的硯台，他向桌上輕輕地放平，開下蓋，一隻汚黑的手在那蓋字一陣摸索，漸漸摩出一些字跡來，他一面摩一面說：</p>
<p>「你是靑雲得意，不大囘家，咱們不熟，說起來，咱們還是世交，又是鄰居，你瞧，邇方硯台，還是我祖父在外面遊宦的時候帶回來的，這上面的字，還是你老人家的祖大人給題上的哩！</p>
<p>我老是不懂，這硯台上爲什麼要題着這一句詩，這一句詩又與硯台何關　你瞧，重簾不捲留香久，明明是　，簾，不，捲，留，香，久，好句子！不過他與硯台何關？</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>她誕生在滿洲，生長在滿洲，她每年過着滿洲的冬，十八年了，她從未見過一次這樣的大雪。她史不曾想到自己走着一條雪的小徑，斷在霎山的山底；僅有的一條歸路隔絕了。她停下了，希望再找到一條雪的小徑。天還落着雪。這雪不是她熟識的雪片，而是陌生的雪塊，雲餅，一剎那，便塞平了山谷，冰流。在這雪下的行人，担心着被埋沒而封鎖在雪下；這雪好像給行人已經造好了雪的　。這相似滿洲的驚人雪野，她不知道，她是生沽在滿洲的都市的。於是，她被這雪嚇得顫抖了，幸而她又發覺了幾條雪的小徑，檢了其中的一條，走着。不久，雪的小徑又斷了。然後，她另換了一條，繼續換了無數條；但每條雪徑的終點，都是同樣的雪山的山底。一瞬間，她陷入雪山之間，尋不見一條雪徑了，好像被一陣朝霧，一層夜色所遮住。她又停下了，不能不慌恐了，她向四外張望，一無所有，這奇異而恐怖的雪上，衹有她一人，這時候她聽見彷彿有人喊叫，像父親的聲音，又像母親的聲音：</p>
<p>『囘來呀！朱琳：』</p>
<p>但是，她看不見一個行人的影子，這雪上遺留的脚印，都是她的。此外有的，是一種奇樣的踪跡；她漸漸地愈看愈多，散遍在她所能看到的地方。他喊了。</p>
<p>『媽媽，這是什麼地方？』</p>
<p>『那是老熊出沒的地方呀！』老熊是滿洲最多而又最厲害的動物，她聽後，立刻痛哭起來。她撰着不知來自何處的一種聲音呼着：</p>
<p>『那你爲什麼不快來救我？難道你不要你的女見了嗎？媽媽，你不能那樣狠心！』　（四十三）</p>

<h3>The Question of Establishing a Far Eastern Anti-Aggression Front</h3>
<p>The movement to organize an anti-aggression front by democratic and peace-loving countries such as England, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union has made considerable progress since President Roosevelt issued his peace declaration and the Soviet Union took active sponsorship measures. However, "peace is indivisible." As long as the rampant aggression of the Far Eastern aggressors exists for one day, the anti-aggression movement in Europe and the West cannot succeed for one day. Therefore, the call to "extend the anti-aggression front to the Far East" is growing louder.</p>
<p>United Press dispatches have proven that the establishment of a Far Eastern anti-aggression front has been put forward as one of the main agendas for seeking world peace. On the 19th, British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons in response to a question from a member of Parliament that "the UK will invite China and other Far Eastern countries to join the anti-aggression front, which is very likely." (London report by Haitong News Agency on the 20th). On the 19th, British Foreign Secretary Halifax also declared in the House of Lords that "the UK is ready to participate in the international conference proposed by Roosevelt at any time." (London report by the Associated Press on the 10th). He also said that "security negotiations will include the Far East." Halifax's report also stated: "British-Soviet negotiations are currently underway and are expected to include the Pacific issue." (London report by Haitong News Agency on the 20th). In addition, our ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, met with the British Foreign Secretary on the 18th and discussed the possibility of expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East. (London report by the Central News Agency on the 29th). Our ambassador to the United States, Hu Shi, also visited the US President on the morning of the 19th to discuss the general situation in the Far East. (Washington report by the Associated Press on the 20th).</p>
<p>Establishing a Far Eastern anti-aggression front and establishing a European anti-aggression front are actually the same event. They are also the only way for democratic and peace-loving countries to protect democratic politics and world peace. From China's perspective, as Guo Taiqi said on the 19th of this month, "China's resolute resistance to war for international political morality and democratic politics has kept the Far Eastern partners of the Axis group busy coping and unable to take care of much. Today, China cannot retreat even slightly, otherwise the world order will inevitably become more chaotic"! This sentence is also a factual statement of our more than twenty months of resistance. This fact proves that China has long been the most loyal and courageous member of the anti-aggression front. In the future, we can only strive for the liberation of our country and nation and world peace through more loyal and courageous struggle. At the same time, it further proves that democratic and peace-loving countries can only truly launch a movement to organize an anti-aggression front by insisting on supporting China's resistance!</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Taiqi said, "Today, China must not retreat even slightly, otherwise the world order will inevitably become more chaotic." On the one hand, it is a sincere warning to the world's democratic and peace-loving countries. It is believed that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who arrived in Chongqing yesterday, must be one of the people who understand this truth best and will make greater efforts for the friendship between China and the United Kingdom and the Far Eastern anti-aggression front. On the other hand, it is a merciless blow to the small number of compromisers and capitulators at home who advocate "anti-communism" and "peace." It proves that China can never obtain true independence and peace in a more chaotic world. It also proves that China's persistence in resistance will surely obtain greater and more international assistance.</p>
<p>Our task today is to expand national diplomacy, assist the government, and urge the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to realize further cooperation, unite all democratic and peace-loving countries, establish and expand the anti-aggression front, first implement effective sanctions against aggressors, and then seek the realization of collective security and true peace. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to combat the obstacles to the future of the anti-aggression front, especially to further and thoroughly sanction the statements and actions of capitulators advocating anti-communism and peace compromise.</p>
<h3>A Letter to Comrades of the Society for Life Education (II)</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Written for the 12th Anniversary of the Life Education Movement</p>
<p>Based on my on-the-ground observations, China is on the road to victory. The Three Principles of the People have become the common belief of the entire country, that is, the highest principle guiding the liberation of the Chinese nation. The Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction is also a correct national policy. The guidelines decided at the Hengshan Conference, such as the people being more important than soldiers, politics being more important than military affairs, the rear being more important than the front, and guerrilla warfare being more important than positional warfare, are all effective ways to help the implementation of the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction. Chiang Kai-shek's refutation of Konoe's statement, on the one hand, pointed out the determination of the national policy of resistance, and on the other hand, shattered the enemy's conspiracy. In the closing speech of the Third National Political Council, Chairman Chiang especially clarified the essence of democratic politics, which is enough to guarantee the belief that resistance will surely win and national reconstruction will surely succeed. This is the progress shown in the political aspect. In the military aspect, the overall resistance combining guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare has already been launched. What is most valuable is that the generals and soldiers I have met all have the determination to resist to the end. In the economic aspect, various important industries are gradually being revived in the interior. Light industry cooperatives have also gradually been launched. What is most gratifying is that many new engineers have emerged. They can build factories without cement and steel. The foundation of the legal currency is still stable. The enemy has tried everything possible but still cannot shake it. What the people have shown, such as Zhao Hongwenguo's family of three generations fighting guerrillas, Zeng Da's mother sending her son to join the army, the children's singing troupe in Taierzhuang turning young traitors into young soldiers, the long-term donations from overseas Chinese, and the charity sales launched by vendors, all show that the hearts of the people have not died, and China will surely prosper. These facts and phenomena all prove that China is striding forward on the road to victory.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are more and more anti-war elements in Japan. In order to suppress the rise of anti-war forces, the government is increasingly moving towards fascism. The Japanese army on the front line lacks morale and has a strong psychological pressure to fight. The puppet regimes they create are destroyed by Chinese patriots, and many puppet troops defect. The strongholds they occupy are cut off by our guerrillas, making communication difficult. The enemy's international market is threatened by the boycott of Japanese goods and is gradually shrinking. Cash is used to抵捕 military needs and imports, which will soon be exhausted. I can only talk about it roughly to prove that Japanese imperialism is becoming weaker and weaker as it fights, and there must be a day when it cannot support it. Internationally, developments that are beneficial to China are gradually occurring. There were originally irreconcilable contradictions between the United Kingdom and the United States, but recently a trade agreement has been signed to reduce economic contradictions, so that their Far Eastern policies can gradually move from parallel actions to cooperation. America is the home of the Monroe Doctrine. In recent years, Germany, Italy, and Japan have sown the seeds of Nazi fascism, creating aggressive cells. The United States feels extremely uneasy. The recent convocation of the Pan-American Conference aims to obtain the understanding and mutual assistance of the American countries to jointly resist aggression. If the United States reduces its domestic concerns, it will naturally be able to take more effective actions on the Far Eastern issue. The Soviet Union, based on its peace policy, has been very sympathetic to China's resistance to aggression from beginning to end, so it faithfully implements the resolution of the League of Nations to provide individual assistance to China. At first, the pro-Japanese factions of various countries spread rumors that China's acceptance of Soviet assistance was a trend towards communism. However, everyone knows that the Soviet Union and China are both member states of the League of Nations, and accepting assistance in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations is its own business. Now that the aggressive front of Germany, Italy, and Japan is tightening, the future trend is that the anti-aggression front of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China is likely to be formed. Even if it is not successfully formed, their parallel actions are also beneficial to China.</p>
<p>We only need to take a look at what has been said above to know the importance of the educator's responsibility. 1. How can we make the people of the whole country understand the Three Principles of the People? Believe in the Three Principles of the People? 2. How can we make the people of the whole country know the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, support the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, and implement the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction? 3. How can we awaken the people of the whole country to unleash greater strength than soldiers? 4. How can we make every ordinary person know the main points of Chiang Kai-shek's refutation of Konoe's statement? 5. How can we make the people of the whole country quickly receive democratic political training and become the cornerstone of democratic politics? 6. How can we make the old ladies all over the country have the spirit of Zhao Lao Tai and Zeng Da Niang? 7. How can we make the children all over the country have the knowledge of the children of Taierzhuang? 8. How can we make the people in the enemy-occupied areas have national consciousness and prevent the establishment of puppet regimes? 9. How can we increase the anti-war forces of the enemy's front-line soldiers and domestic people to suppress and eliminate their aggressive arrogance? 10. How can we make the anti-aggression movement around the world effective to sanction the actions of the aggressor countries and shatter their conspiracy to disrupt peace? These can all be said to be educational issues. From this, it can be seen that the educator's responsibility is great. It is very meaningful for us to hold our 12th anniversary celebration at a time when these heavy responsibilities are pressing down on us, and we cannot allow ourselves to be even slightly negligent.</p>
<p>On this memorable day, the most vivid impression that comes to my mind is: a group of young people gave up their attachment to diplomas and ran from the universities to the countryside to live with farmers. Time flies quickly. This was the Luo Jias of twelve years ago. What this group of young people brought was not cultural relief but a humble heart to explore a truly suitable education for China to move forward.</p>
<p>After these young people came into contact with the farmers, both sides had surprising discoveries. The young people had been educated in universities for a long time and had no strength to catch chickens. They could only hold a pen and write a few lines. After they went to the countryside for a short time, they discovered that they also had hands, which could be used for work, farming, experimentation, and using guns. The farmers, on the other hand, had lived in an atmosphere of "the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to know" for thousands of years, and had long been wrapped in headscarves so that they could not think. When they came into contact with young intellectuals, they could not help but shout out, "We also have brains!" The young people discovered that they had hands, so they could both sit and talk and stand up and act. The farmers discovered that they had brains, so they could understand and believe in the Three Principles of the People and exert their strength to strive for China's freedom and equality. This rediscovery of hands and brains is a very important gain and should be especially pointed out during the commemoration.</p>
<p>What have we done in these twelve years? Three things, not yet finished. First, anti-Westernization education. Second, anti-traditional education. Third, establishing educational theories and methods for striving for freedom and equality in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country.</p>
<p>(1) The intention of anti-Westernization education is not to oppose foreign knowledge. We sincerely welcome the true knowledge imported from foreign countries. However, we dare not agree that building Western-style buildings, speaking foreign languages, and using foreign books are the only ways to be considered a true school. Some Westernized educators almost can't poop without a flushing Western toilet. Especially without industrial production, they want industrial enjoyment and expense. China is a poor country, how can it withstand such waste? Wasting on this aspect, there is no money to run education on the other aspect, and the result is education for a minority of people.</p>
<p>(2) Anti-traditional education is also not against inherent advantages. We sincerely support China's inherent virtues. However, we oppose the education of "officials are all noble, and all are scholars" for the sake of promotion, as well as the transcendental education of "teaching for the sake of teaching, and reading for the sake of reading." As for the general public, we cannot remain silent about the phenomenon of "spending money to let people read dead books, but not knowing a single character themselves."</p>
<p>(3) Establishing principles and methods of education for striving for freedom and equality. The reason why we oppose Westernized education and traditional education is to open up a broad road so that the education for striving for freedom and equality in this semi-colonial country can emerge. The Three Principles of the People is the highest guidance for our work. Transforming from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country into a free and equal country owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people requires good coordination in military, political, economic, and educational aspects to achieve the goal. Education must have several conditions to undertake such a great mission. (1) Education must be combat. Education is not a toy, not an ornament, and not a medium for promotion and wealth. Education is a weapon, a weapon for the liberation of the nation and mankind. (2) Education must be life-based. All education must be effective through life. The life of resisting war and building the country is the education of resisting war and building the country. (3) Education must be scientific. This kind of education cannot be copied from anywhere. We must use methods to continue to study it based on objective circumstances. Moreover, the content of this education must also include and emphasize natural science and social science. Otherwise, it cannot move forward. (4) Education must be mass-based. It is by no means possible for a few people to succeed in transforming a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country into an independent country. We must educate the masses to take on this great mission together. But to hope that the common people can receive this education must have three conditions: first, to save money so that the poor can receive education; second, to save time so that the busy people can also study; third, to be popular so that the common people who have not received common education can also understand and be interested. In this way, if the principle of "knowing and spreading immediately" is not used, the goal of educating the common people cannot be achieved, and the education received by the common people must be implemented collectively. Collective is strength. Individual education is still a plate of loose sand and cannot exert its full power. (5) Education must be planned. We must have a comprehensive plan to make a general distribution of human and financial resources, with priorities. From semi-colonial and semi-feudal to freedom and equality, there must be a continuously developing education plan to gradually guide us forward.</p>
<p>In these twelve years, in response to the needs of the objective environment, we launched four education movements, namely, rural education, popular education, national disaster relief education, and wartime education. These four movements are only four stages of one movement. This one movement is the life movement, which can also be said to be the education movement from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country to a free and equal country.</p>
<p>Now to ask: What should we do in the future? How to do it?</p>
<p>1. Continue the past work. The great War of Resistance Against Japan has made Westernized education and traditional education unable to stand. New teachers can run education in thatched sheds and caves without blackboards and chalk. This is such a gratifying phenomenon. However, there are still many teachers who teach dead books, dead teachers, and die teaching books, and bookworms who read dead books, die reading books, and die reading books. The lackeys of knowledge have not completely changed. Cultural compradors are still in the general store. The Western-style stereotypes and old stereotypes inside and outside the school: literary stereotypes, military stereotypes, propaganda stereotypes have not been eliminated, and cultural ruffians grow in the cities. The countryside suffers from cultural anemia. Those who miss class must desperately make up for it. After making up for class, they have to take supplements. Poor geniuses are buried. Even now, some people oppose the wartime education needed in wartime. They are hidden under the shield of century-old plans and basic academics. They often issue distorted remarks that violate national survival. To strive for the victory of the War of Resistance and the success of national reconstruction, we must correct these problems. We should not passively criticize these diseases but actively help correct them.</p>
<p>2. Take on the current task. Our current task is to launch comprehensive education to coordinate with the comprehensive War of Resistance and strive for the final victory. We must expand education to the front, to the border areas, to the enemy's rear, to the places where overseas Chinese are located, and to all places in the world where the Chinese are fighting. Others are unwilling to go to the places that should be gone. We all have to go our separate ways. We must send the Three Principles of the People, send the</p>
<p>Outline for National Reconstruction, send Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to the People of the Country and the instructions to refute the near-term statements, send Chiang Kai-shek's instructions to the National Education Conference, and send them to the heart of everyone, and also show them in everyone's life and actions, to crush the enemy's conspiracy to provoke discord, destroy the puppet regimes created by the enemy, reveal the enemy's ambition to destroy our nation, eliminate all possible foreign aid that the enemy can get, increase the anti-war mood of the people under the enemy's oppression, eliminate the frictions caused by old grudges and political misunderstandings between groups, enlighten the entire nation's understanding of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, strengthen the entire nation's unity for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and strengthen the entire nation's belief that the War of Resistance will surely win and National Reconstruction will surely succeed. We should not underestimate the strength of others. Even old ladies and children are soldiers of the same front. We should not underestimate our own strength. When a primary school teacher is not only the mentor of three or forty lifetimes, if he cultivates students to know and spread immediately, it is easy to influence three or four hundred people. The importance of his position is like a combat company commander or battalion commander. When a primary school principal is not only the mentor of one or two hundred students but also the mentor of one or two hundred households and two thousand people. The importance of his position is like a combat regimental commander. When a county education bureau director is not only the mentor of hundreds of schools and tens of thousands of students, but also the mentor of hundreds of thousands of people. His position is like the commander-in-chief of a group army, or even the division commander of a theater. But if you underestimate your position, underestimate the strength of others, underestimate the principles of life education, such as knowing and spreading immediately, and the work-study group, you will become a lonely crow, a bachelor, from small to pessimistic, wandering, compromising, and it is unimaginable when the enemy comes. There are many people who make big things small. The most important thing is that we must recognize the importance of our mission. In addition, we must also carry two things with us: one is the thread; the other is the lantern. If a piece of clothing is torn, it can be torn more and more, and torn more and more, and in the end it can be torn to pieces. The only way is to sew it up with needle and thread as soon as you encounter a flaw. At this critical moment of the nation's life and death, there is no room for even a slight crack. If there is a crack, take out our needle and thread. The lantern is to illuminate people to recognize the route and move forward, not only to illuminate themselves but also to illuminate the people who are walking forward with them, and enter the realm of freedom and equality.</p>
<p>3. Strengthen our strength. In order to continue the past work and take on the current task, we must increase our own strength, otherwise we will not be able to do it. First, academics are strength. We must improve the research. The establishment of the Xiaozhuang Institute is to hope to study the important problems of 抗战建国 that have been neglected, in order to solve them and help increase the strength of 抗战建国. In addition, I hope that each of our comrades will seize a problem and continue to study it continuously and perseveringly, and will not stop until it is solved. At the same time, we must also strive to gain a correct understanding of China, the enemy country, and the world. The group of children we teach must also constantly seek progress. Second, organization is strength. The Life Education Society has been established, which is good news. Comrade Ji Ping said well: The Life Education Society is a big family in the education field. It is the whole body of educational thinkers, the body of educational activists, the group of educational workers, the group of teacher training, the group of ordinary people learning life and knowledge, and a community living together. He also said: He should be popular, everyone living together; he should be factoryized, everyone dividing and cooperating; he should be schoolized, everyone teaching and learning together. We all agree with these words, only the group of teacher training should be changed to the group of teacher training, and "tell it to others what you have just learnt". Traditional schoolization is not enough, we must "tell it to others what you have just learnt" to jump out of our small fence. In fact, the entire Life Education Society should be two big work-study groups. Running education is our work; studying problems is our learning; living an organized life together is our group. We are teaching the people's children according to the Three Principles of the People, so our own organization must be democratized. Not only the head office must have a democratic organization, but also the branch offices and the work-study service group must have a democratic organization. Third, action is strength. We must exert our strength and increase our strength in the actions of 抗战建国. As Chairman Chiang said, "Wartime life is modern life. In today's era, whether it is an individual or a society, if they do not implement wartime life, they cannot exist and will be eliminated and destroyed." This is such a correct truth! In our words: Wartime life is wartime education. We must use the wartime life of action to increase our strength.</p>
<p>Increasing our strength is to help the cause and win the final victory under the leadership of the great chairman Chiang in the three most important principles of the people. Let us all play our whole life in order to help defeat Japanese aggression and surely create our independent, equal and happy Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Churches' Work During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Jane</p>
<p>The history of church establishment in Shanghai is already ninety years old, with the earliest church built at Zhengjia Muqiao. Ninety years later, the situation has changed drastically. There are now over seventy churches in Shanghai, of which fifty-seven are orthodox, with a total of ten thousand parishioners.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Missionary Association is responsible for coordinating the various churches. The general office for publishing, selling, and donating Bibles is located at 158 Hong Kong Road. The general publishing house for ordinary religious literature is located at the Guangxuehui, 128 Museum Road. In addition, the Shanghai churches have established a radio station (call sign XMHD, frequency 760), which broadcasts for seven hours daily. The content includes sermons, reports on religious news from around the world and China, and music.</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War of August two years ago, Chinese Christian leaders in Shanghai, recognizing the urgent need for relief work, initiated a dinner meeting. They invited Chinese and foreign Christians residing in Shanghai to discuss relief for soldiers and refugees. At that time, the governments of Britain and the United States repeatedly urged their citizens to return home. However, the attendance of foreign Christians at the dinner meeting was unexpected, leading to the formation of a united front of Christians. The Shanghai Christian United Relief Association was established at this time.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the United Association has achieved remarkable results. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees were everywhere. The United Association immediately began fundraising and established eighteen refugee shelters, accommodating approximately 150,000 refugees. They provided the refugees with clothing, food, and shelter for seven months. After finding a livelihood, the refugees left the shelters on their own. Eventually, only 2,200 refugees remained, gathered at the eighteenth refugee shelter, located at Changping Road, near Hart Road. Of the remaining, there were four hundred people. However, at this time, the nature of the shelter differed from before. Many refugees were self-sufficient, and the United Association provided them with appropriate subsidies. In addition, the United Association established a tuberculosis sanatorium specifically for refugees suffering from tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Refugees in the war zone had no time to carry clothes. The United Association also provided appropriate relief to refugees outside the shelters who had difficulty with basic needs. The Moore Memorial Church and the Women's Self-Government Association were responsible for most of the sewing work. According to the Moore Memorial Church's annual report, they had already produced 1,130 mattresses, quilts, and bedsheets, and 129,616 articles of clothing. They are still continuing their work. Last autumn, when the weather in Shanghai turned cold, the United Association donated a large number of cotton vests to soldiers.</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem for refugees outside the shelters, the United Association, through the Moore Memorial Church, provided food for 300,000 people over seven months.</p>
<p>Regarding the relief of wounded soldiers, the United Association was responsible for operating several wounded soldier hospitals during the Shanghai War. Other wounded soldier hospitals also received direct or indirect economic and human resource assistance from the United Association. Seriously wounded soldiers were given special diets. All wounded soldiers were given friendly comfort. Many young Christians volunteered to serve as nurses. After being discharged from the hospital, the wounded soldiers often wrote letters expressing their remembrance of the kind care they received.</p>
<p>After the closure of various wounded soldier hospitals, a Western Christian doctor suggested that the Shanghai International Red Cross open a hospital for disabled wounded soldiers, specializing in accommodating soldiers who had lost their legs. This hospital was established on January 10th last year. The hospital was located at the former seventeenth wounded soldier hospital. The total number of wounded soldiers was 403. The hospital fitted them with prosthetic legs and arms to enable them to move. Those without employment were taught life skills to prevent them from wandering the streets after being discharged. Many of these soldiers, after finding a new spirit in life, volunteered to become Christians.</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War, the Salvation Army, with the economic assistance of the Shanghai International Red Cross, established several refugee shelters. One was on West Yanan Road, which has accommodated 13,000 refugees since the beginning of the war. The second shelter was established at Jiaotong University, which accommodated 17,000 refugees in seven months. In addition, a third shelter was established on Xiaoshadu Road, accommodating 7,000 refugees. There was also a refugee tuberculosis hospital, providing special care.</p>
<p>For homeless orphans, the Salvation Army took them in and taught them sewing, weaving, shoemaking, carpentry, and other daily necessities and handicrafts, which have already been sold for over 2,000 yuan. Most of the refugees working in the shelters have acquired skills to support themselves. After leaving the shelter, they jointly contributed about 80 yuan to the Salvation Army to express their gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p>Regarding the education of wounded soldiers and refugees, the Christian United Association regarded it as a major task in relief work. General education was provided to convalescing wounded soldiers in hospitals and refugees in various shelters. At the same time, vocational education was also provided to enable refugees to make a living after leaving the shelter.</p>
<p>Many residents of the Nanshi area have returned. However, nineteen out of ten houses were burned down, and many gathered broken tiles to build walls to protect themselves from the wind and frost. Recognizing this, the church established the Puyi Handicraft Cooperative in March of last year. The Shanghai International Red Cross collected old clothes and broken socks and sent them there, where they were recycled to make various practical items for sale. A clinic was also set up to help the poor and sick. A Western doctor volunteered his services. Recognizing the importance of children's education, kindergartens and workers' children's classrooms were successively established. Furthermore, due to the malnutrition of refugees, soy milk was produced to supplement their diet.</p>
<p>Recently, these refugees have been seeking to open up fertile soil and cultivate various vegetables for a living under dilapidated walls, ruins, and broken bricks.</p>
<p>Over two hundred people work daily in the handicraft cooperative, while tens of thousands seek help. Most refugees lack food and clothing and are on the verge of death. The handicraft cooperative also suffers from a lack of funds to hire more workers. One day, the cooperative sought volunteers to resign to allow more impoverished people to work. An old man donated eight jiao, the wages he earned in eight days. This was all he had. This organization urgently needs to be expanded.</p>

However, the cooperation of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union could force Japan to surrender within five or six months. All parties also stated that the Far East anti-aggression policy should include an embargo on arms to Japan and a ban on the purchase of Japanese goods, while at the same time vigorously assisting China.</p>
<h3>General Zhu De Discusses Persisting in the Anti-Japanese War in North China</h3>
<p>— Ke Han</p>
<p>The news of Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army (i.e., the × Route Army), being promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the × War Zone spread like wildfire throughout Jin Southeast and throughout North China. Millions of mouths eagerly discussed the event, and millions of hearts leaped and rejoiced for this precious news, feeling infinite comfort. Upon hearing the news, the reporter rushed to the headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army to congratulate General Zhu Sui, who has persisted in the anti-Japanese war in North China for nearly two years, and to inquire about his views on the anti-Japanese war in North China.</p>
<p>Current Situation in North China</p>
<p>Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhu received the reporter in his office at the headquarters. His attitude, demeanor, and tone of voice were still as simple, amiable, and sincere as ever. When the reporter raised the above question, he first smiled meaningfully and said softly: "The situation in North China today is something that the × troops did not anticipate at first. - The × troops did not expect that we would create so many anti-Japanese base areas in their rear and breed so many regular troops and guerrillas."</p>
<p>"The × troops did not expect that they could not effectively control the entire North China, even after occupying the main transportation routes and important cities. They could not only use their puppet regime to rule the entire North China and use the vast manpower of North China, but also failed to exploit the abundant resources of North China to supplement their financial and material deficiencies. In particular, they did not expect that after occupying North China, they would suffer significant damage in their strategic plans. The few railways and large cities they occupied are now surrounded on all sides by our anti-Japanese base areas and regular troops and guerrillas, subjected to constant attacks, threats, ambushes, and sabotage, and they cannot concentrate and move the 500,000 troops they left behind to attack the Northwest and other war zones - this is where they made a mistake."</p>
<p>Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhu paused slightly and continued uninterrupted:</p>
<p>"Because they want to compensate for their mistakes, at this time when the War of Resistance is transitioning from the first stage to the second stage - the stalemate stage, when the war situation on the main front battlefield is turning silent, the × troops are withdrawing troops back to North China and launching large-scale attacks on various anti-Japanese base areas in North China. Since the attack on the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in September of last year, Jin Northwest, Jin Southwest, Ji Central, Ji South, Lu Northwest, and the entire North China have been in a state of tense and bitter fighting to this day."</p>
<p>"Based on the past experiences and lessons of the failed attacks on various anti-Japanese base areas, the × troops have made some changes in their attack methods. The specific method is: first, "sweep" the plains to eliminate the periphery of the mountain areas; then, attack the mountain areas to completely annihilate our army that persists in the anti-Japanese war in North China. In combat, there are two characteristics: first, they first occupy the strong points near the railway lines, deploy their forces well, and then advance forward very heavily, occupying a place and building roads and bunkers, step by step. This is to reduce the area of our occupied areas; at the same time, they also adopt a pincers-shaped advance. They divide their forces and converge to attack, attempting to force our army into an area and annihilate it in one fell swoop. First, they use fast-moving units, transporting troops by armored vehicles, and taking advantage of the opportunity to enter immediately when they encounter us."</p>
<p>"In addition, they pay attention to political, economic, and cultural conspiracies, sabotage, and deception."</p>
<p>"Such cruel and vicious attacks are a great test for the troops operating in North China. Units that are generally of poor quality, loosely organized internally, have weak political work, poor discipline towards the masses, and cannot get the support of the masses often find it difficult to cope with and sustain. And commanders who are determined, have flexible command and combat skills, soldiers who are brave, have political education, can strictly abide by the discipline of the masses, and have experience in guerrilla warfare, although they inevitably suffer some losses - even very large losses - in fierce battles, they can still persist in the encirclement of the × troops. For example, in the sweeping of the Jinnan Plain by the × troops, they launched a fierce attack in six routes. Although the Jinnan Plain base area suffered considerable damage, it ultimately failed to achieve its goal of annihilating our main force. On the contrary, the Julu and Xiangchenggu鉗 made several night battles, causing the × troops to lose troops and suffer great losses. Today, our army is still persisting in the anti-Japanese war in Jinnan, and the Jinnan Administrative Commissioner's Office is still exercising its power and leading guerrillas in Jinnan."</p>
<p>Future of the Anti-Japanese War in North China</p>
<p>When talking about the future of the anti-Japanese war in North China, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: "Past experiences and lessons are the compass for future persistence in the anti-Japanese war."</p>
<p>The close unity of the party, government, army, and people, and the close connection of work are the most fundamental key to persisting in the victory of the anti-Japanese war in North China. Today, North China is indeed in a serious state. If the relationships between all parties cannot be very coordinated, and the work of all parties cannot have reasonable cooperation, and even if persisting in combat is not a prerequisite, and frictions cannot be eliminated, its future will be unimaginable. The main reason why the Jin-Cha-Ji District has been able to smash the attacks of the × troops several times is that the party, government, army, and people are united as one. Therefore, I regard this as the first condition for overcoming difficulties and overcoming the difficult period of persisting in the anti-Japanese war in North China.</p>
<p>Secondly, it lies in extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses. In combat behind enemy lines, the conditions of the masses are even more important than in other places. The strength of the masses is incomparably great. With the masses, it is equivalent to having a backer. Everything can be solved, and any difficulties can be overcome. Without the help of the masses, even if there are good terrain conditions, there is still no guarantee. The great battle in Jinnan this time is the best lesson. In combat on the Great Plains, under the coercion of the × troops' mechanized units, most people would think that it is impossible to cope with, but under the mobilization of the masses to participate in the war, the terrain can actually be changed. This is probably something that most people would not have expected. Today, villages are connected to villages in Jinnan, and everywhere in the Great Plains there are ditches dug by the hands of millions of people. Our troops can be sheltered and maneuvered in the ditches, using them as fortifications to resist, resist, and guerrilla against the × troops, while the × troops' mechanized units lose their effectiveness. When the green gauze tent rises, the × troops in Jinnan will be even more difficult. From this, it can be seen that the people's power is magnificent, inexhaustible, and inexhaustible. In future combat, in a certain sense, the masses are more important than the army.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to improve the tactical skills of commanders, strengthen the political work of the troops, and strictly enforce the military discipline of the troops towards the masses. Commanders must be good at controlling troops and using troops flexibly. Soldiers must be able to obey the commands of commanders under political education. Sun Tzu said: "If the soldiers do not know the generals, it is because the generals are given to the × troops. If the generals do not know the soldiers, it is because the country is given to the × troops." This sentence is worthy of the vigilance of our national anti-Japanese troops. If the troops themselves cannot be united as one from top to bottom, the result will be that the anti-Japanese war will suffer great damage. If you cannot know yourself and your enemy, and do not know how to take the initiative to adopt flexible guerrilla warfare to deal with, fight, and struggle with the × troops, you will also suffer. Under the new method of attack by the × troops, it is necessary to have excellent quality, a strong team, and be able to take the initiative to operate flexibly in order to make the × troops 空 empty, and even penetrate into the back of the × troops and attack the × troops from all sides to achieve the goal of annihilating the × troops.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter specially raised the question of the operations of the × War Zone to ask, and Commander Zhu also said:</p>
<p>"The × War Zone is mostly mountainous. It is not easy for the × troops' mechanized units to exert themselves, which is a favorable condition. The × troops will use larger units to attack and use more aircraft to bomb and release poison gas. Therefore, today, we must especially strengthen the education of soldiers and civilians in air defense and poison gas defense, and we must also strive to destroy roads and clear the fields. Originally, marching and fighting in mountainous areas has already made the × troops scream bitterly. We must create more difficulties for them. We must not only smash the attacks of the × troops, so that the × troops cannot take our materials, but also annihilate the × troops and intercept the materials transported into the base areas."</p>
<p>"In short, as long as we have the determination and confidence to persist in the anti-Japanese war in North China, as long as we can achieve the above three main points, North China will eventually be ours, and the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth will fly everywhere in North China!" He concluded his conversation in a firm tone.</p>
<h3>Interruption of Traffic on the Pinghan Railway; Serious Situation in the Northern Battlefield; Counteroffensive Advances by Our Army in Sui, Cha, Ji, and Jin; Our Air Force Active in the Northwest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] The Chinese army on various fronts has made progress. The puppet troops at Mentougou, west of Beiping, have already defected and are in contact with the local Chinese guerrillas to jointly attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Mentougou has been</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Tianjin News, traffic on the Pinghan Railway is still interrupted. Our army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the × army in Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, and other places. A guard of × army at the southeast corner of Tianjin was killed on the morning of the 19th. The × army immediately declared martial law and conducted a large-scale search, but the assassin escaped calmly. Also, at about 9:00 PM on the 18th, there was a lot of gunfire in southern Tianjin. According to the investigation, the puppet police station was attacked. Several puppet police officers were injured. After the × army arrived, there were conflicts again. The gunfire stopped at about 11:00 PM. The × army was therefore extremely panicked, and the city has tightened its guard.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 20th] Our army in Sui launched attacks on multiple routes a few days ago. The × army felt threatened. On the 11th, with seven or eight hundred cavalry and over a hundred armored vehicles, they invaded westward along the Angu Avenue, attempting to contain our army's forces. At noon on the 13th, they encountered our ×× units near Anbei. After several hours of fierce fighting, the × army was defeated and fled back to Tailiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiuyuan, 19th] Recently, the × troops in Huanbao have been actively constructing defensive fortifications and setting up barbed wire outside the city. Zhangjiakou has been frequently surprised by the × army due to the emptiness of its defenses.</p>
<p>[Min Ge News Agency, Hequ, 20th] North of the Yellow River in western Sui, our units have begun to move out since the 8th of this month, advancing towards Baotou Guyang. The × army felt threatened and on the 11th, with seven or eight hundred infantry and cavalry and over a hundred armored vehicles, invaded westward along the avenue from Guyang to Anbei, and used aircraft to cover them. An encounter battle broke out near Anbei at noon on the 11th. The officers and soldiers fought bravely in a bloody battle with the × troops for more than three hours, killing over two hundred × troops and destroying over twenty × armored vehicles. The × army was defeated on the evening of the 13th and fled near Taiwan. We are currently splitting up to strike.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 10th] In the past ten days, our brave air force has been unusually active in Shanxi Province. It bombed Houma Taiyuan on the 8th, bombed Taigu on the 10th, attacked Taiyuan again on the 11th, and dropped many bombs in Yuci. At 2:00 PM on the 14th, one of our aircraft circled and scouted over Jiangxian for about 20 minutes before leisurely flying west.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Southern Shanxi, Enemy Troops Extremely Disturbed, Our Army Victorious in Xinjiang and Other Areas, Area Around Zhongli Under Our Control</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 20th] To the right of the Tongpu Road south of Linfen, fighting is intensifying. One of our units has attacked and captured several important points in the suburbs. The enemy is extremely disturbed. A portion of the enemy that invaded southeastern Shanxi has already retreated to aid Taigu and Xin County. We are currently intercepting them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xing County, 19th] The fighting around Jishan, Xinjiang, and Fencheng has been quite smooth in the past two days. On the night of the 17th, one of our units surrounded and attacked the enemy in Yangzhao Village. One part feigned an attack in the north of the village, while another went straight into the village, leading to fierce street fighting. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, fled south, suffering heavy losses after being intercepted by us. We are searching and attacking eastward along the Lengshan-Xinjiang highway, destroying dozens of highway and telegraph lines along the way. The enemy in Xinjiang attempted to come out of the city to provide cover for road repairs but were repulsed by us. The enemy troops in Fencheng were subjected to a fierce attack by us on the night of the 15th and ultimately dared not engage in battle. The enemy is exhausted, as can be seen from this. The enemy in the area around Zhongli has been subjected to fierce attacks by us in recent days, suffering heavy casualties. They are now holding onto their strongholds, firing artillery blindly in all directions, daring not boldly cover road repairs. Our army is currently divided into several teams searching and attacking in all directions. On the 15th, we again encountered the enemy in the area of Diaoxishan. With a strategy of advancing separately and converging, we routed the entire enemy force. The enemy dispatched a large force to attack on the afternoon of the 15th. Our army calmly responded, engaging in a back-and-forth melee. After several struggles, we finally defeated the enemy troops. In the evening, dozens of enemy soldiers fled from Jinluo Town towards Zhongyang, but were intercepted by us, with most of them killed. A portion of the enemy in Zhongyang attempting to provide reinforcements was also repulsed by us. Currently, the area around Zhongli is under our control. The enemy's attempt to complete the northwest highway network has failed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 19th] The enemy cavalry commander, Musaburo, was killed by us in the An'yun campaign. His body was cremated in Shangduan Village north of Yuncheng. Furthermore, because our army launched a multi-pronged siege of Yuncheng, the enemy suffered excessive damage and burned down most of the villagers' houses in Shangduan Village, also massacring over 130 villagers.</p>
<h3>Enemy Unable to Cross the Yellow River, Northwest Defenses Consolidated, Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is Truly Satisfactory, Remarks by General Jiang Dingwen</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 12th] Jiang Dingwen, Chairman of Shaanxi Province and Commander of the Xth War Zone, told a Reuters reporter today, "I do not believe that the Japanese army intends or has the ability to cross the Yellow River and attack Xi'an in the near future. If the Japanese army wishes to continue advancing westward in North China, their strategy will be to advance from the Hankou direction, passing through Xiangyang. However, this route is mountainous, and the Japanese army would have to fight through mountains, taking Xi'an at a cost that outweighs the gain. We have been preparing defensive works for several months. The Chinese army has deployed defenses in layers. The Japanese army cannot fly across."</p>
<p>"A certain foreign military expert recently visited our defense area and said to me upon returning, 'If the Japanese attempt to seize Xi'an, they would be incredibly foolish.' Since the war has not yet extended to Shaanxi Province, the commander of Shaanxi Province often sends troops to other places to assist in the fighting. Shaanxi Province has already dispatched 250,000 new recruits. We are currently focusing on political education and economic development. We are now adopting the baojia system, using it as a means to conscript soldiers locally and promote political education."</p>
<p>Widespread Cooperative Movement in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>Commander Jiang Dingwen continued, referring to economic development, saying that the wheat harvest this year is expected to be extremely bountiful, and cotton production is also considerable. Unfortunately, there are not many yarn factories, so the authorities are now encouraging the use of hand looms. The widespread cooperative movement in Shaanxi Province is a characteristic of economic development. The provincial government has issued loans of six million yuan to expand industrial cooperatives, and local banks have also allocated four million yuan for their expenses. In addition, the central government has supplemented loans with textiles, soap, and munitions. Production is now increasing daily, and transportation is rapidly improving.</p>
<p>Railways and Highways Progressing Rapidly</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, three thousand kilometers of new highways have been built, and a new railway will be completed in eight months. The rails needed for it are taken from the Longhai Railway east of Zhengzhou. The Huayi Army has dismantled the Longhai Road for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is Satisfactory</p>
<p>The relationship between the National Army and the Communist Party is quite good, he said. When asked about the Communist special zone in northern Shaanxi, Commander Jiang Dingwen replied, "Ten years of discord cannot, of course, be eliminated in a single day. However, the current situation is truly satisfactory. In the eyes of the central government, there is no so-called Communist special zone. We, in light of the current environment, allow the existence of the Communist Party."</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Zeng Zhongming (2)</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhuoming</p>
<p>Number 27 Colon Street is a building that houses one dwelling. Wang [Jingwei] and Zeng [Zhongming] lived in it. They had five bodyguards stationed at the back door leading to the kitchen and at the doors on the second and third floors. Security was especially tight at night. The residence was surrounded by local secret police and consulate informants.</p>
<p>Around two thirty in the morning of the twentieth and twenty-first, residents living near the Wang residence on Colon Street were awakened from their sleep by the sound of explosions. First, there was one blast. After a short silence, there were two more, followed by continuous gunfire. At first, people thought it was the sound of firecrackers late at night, but when they heard shouts of "Help! Help!" in French, they knew that something extraordinary had happened.</p>
<p>When everyone looked out the window at Number 27, they saw flashes of firelight in the darkness. Knowing who lived there, they immediately understood that a Chinese assassination squad was carrying out its task of eradicating evil.</p>
<p>Then, a Chinese woman shouted in Chinese on the balcony. Soon after, three or four shadows jumped over the wall and scattered in all directions, firing continuously. At this time, someone in the house - some say it was Wang Jingwei himself - fired at the fleeing assassins. In addition, four or five people came out of the house to chase after those who were eliminating the traitors.</p>
<p>How Zeng Zhongming Was Assassinated</p>
<p>According to various sources, they entered through the open space near the kitchen. The method was to pile a heap of bricks outside the wall and then climb the support of the barbed wire fence from the brick pile. After entering the courtyard, they used an axe to break open the back door of the kitchen. After entering, they immediately shot the bodyguard in the thigh. Then, one person kept watch downstairs, while two others went upstairs and broke down the door with an axe. The bodyguard on the second floor was shot in the thigh in the same way. After each door on the upper floors was broken open, they finally found Zeng Zhongming's room. As soon as the door was broken open, they fired continuously at the bed. According to those who were present at the time, the person watching downstairs also fired upstairs, probably to prevent anyone from jumping out of the window.</p>
<p>The bed of Zeng Zhongming and his wife (some say that Zeng's wife and daughter had only arrived in Hanoi less than forty-eight hours ago) was about one and a half meters from the door, slightly to the right. When Zeng was awakened by the gunfire, he jumped out of bed, but at this time, he had already been wounded in several places in the abdomen and thigh, and he immediately fell to the ground. Zeng's wife also suffered serious injuries to her thigh.</p>
<p>When the eradicators of traitors believed that both Zeng and his wife had been killed, they followed the original route and jumped out of the wall. The entire incident only lasted twenty-five minutes, and the speed of their actions was truly astonishing!</p>
<p>The Arrest of the Eradicators of Traitors</p>
<p>After the sound of gunfire from the Wang residence was heard, someone notified the police station by telephone. At the same time, four people followed them on Colon Street. Soon, one person was arrested near the Hanoi prison, and two people were arrested at the intersection of Burke Street and Taille Street. The reason for their easy capture was probably because they were fleeing on foot.</p>
<p>The Rescue of the Wounded</p>
<p>After the police arrived at the scene, they immediately summoned the Annamese doctor Phung Ngoc Tue from across the street from the Wang residence to provide treatment. When the doctor arrived, Zeng Zhongming and his wife were lying in bed, their bedding completely soaked in blood. Zeng's injuries were very serious. The blood vessels in his thigh were injured, resulting in a great deal of bleeding. Three bullets hit his abdomen, and others hit his legs. In his pain,</p>
<p>Zeng said in French, "I need a surgeon!" And he said to the doctor, "My stomach hurts terribly!..." When the doctor was about to give him an injection, Zeng's wife questioned the doctor about what medicine he was going to use. After a long explanation, she finally allowed the injection. But Zeng still felt severe pain in his abdomen and kept asking for water. Fifteen minutes after the arrival of the Annamese doctor Tue, another French doctor arrived. The two doctors decided to carry the seriously injured Zeng Zhongming and his wife and two others to the hospital. On the 21st, the bullets in Zeng's abdomen and legs were removed, but there was still a lot of bleeding and three holes in his intestines. After the surgery, Zeng's body was very weak, and his abdomen continued to ache severely, and he was desperately thirsty. He died at 4:30 p.m. at the Lanessan Hospital in Hanoi. Before his death, he signed a check for over 50,000 yuan to one of the people around him.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Peace Proposal, President Kong Expresses Approval, Says He Deeply Hopes the Great Plan Will Succeed, To Lay the Foundation for World Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Yesterday, when asked for his opinion on President Roosevelt's appeal for peace in Europe, President Kong specially expressed his thoughts as follows: President Roosevelt's note to the German leader and the Italian Prime Minister can be described as the most important document in modern international relations. President Roosevelt, with foresight and vision, is appealing for peace for all mankind. At a time when the situation in Europe is most critical, he is inviting the responsible authorities of various countries to guarantee non-aggression against other countries, as a basis for discussing conscription and economic issues. The brightness and forthrightness of his intention, the greatness and strength of his courage, truly meet the highest ideals of the American people. All those who love peace cannot but admire it. China has been engaged in the war of resistance due to Japan's military aggression, which has lasted for two years. The impact of this war is not limited to China alone. All parts of the world have suffered from it, and the countries that are most closely related to China have suffered even more deeply. If, at a time when Japan's aggression has not yet ceased, a European war unfortunately breaks out, then the Eastern Hemisphere will be filled with the flames of war, and the situation will become uncontrollable. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. The so-called indivisibility of peace lies in this. Today, if all countries in the world can simultaneously support the guarantees proposed by President Roosevelt, then mankind can certainly regain a glimmer of hope. We deeply hope that President Roosevelt's great plan will succeed, so as to lay the foundation for world peace.</p>

<h3>On the International Situation, the Soviet Union Decides to Take New Action, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Conclude a Military Agreement, Defense of the Far East Also to be Discussed</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 20th) The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" stated that the current period is the busiest international "pause." The whole world is now waiting for Hitler's response to President Roosevelt's address. Leaders and diplomats of various countries are frequently interacting. This action can be divided into three categories: (1) Contacts between Britain and France and Moscow and Ankara, as well as contacts with the Qianbo States and the Balkans. The negotiations are progressing very well. (2) Interactions in Germany, which are even more convenient due to the celebration of Hitler's fiftieth birthday, because it can attract representatives from Central and Southeastern European countries to participate. (3) Open talks between Italian Prime Minister Dariqi and Hungary in Rome, as well as talks with Yugoslavia in the Yugoslav capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] The Soviet government has decided to take significant action regarding the current international situation. However, the nature of this action is currently unknown. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has recalled its ambassadors to major European countries, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Today, all morning newspapers here carried reports of the Soviet Union taking new action. The "News Chronicle" stated that Stalin had recalled the ambassadors to Britain, France, and Germany, as well as the envoy to Sweden. The four diplomats will arrive in Moscow today to participate in a meeting to discuss the Soviet Union's attitude towards the conclusion of an agreement with Western countries. When the Soviet ambassadors to France and Germany passed through Poland, the Soviet representative to Poland reported to them on the Polish government's attitude towards cooperation with the Soviet Union. The "Daily Mail" correspondent in Paris stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to cooperate with Eastern European countries to resist aggression, but has also proposed conditions for exchange to Britain and France, that is, when Japan attacks the Soviet Union, Britain and France should provide assistance to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the "Times" correspondent in Warsaw stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov recently inquired with the foreign ministries of the Baltic states whether they would welcome Soviet assistance if their independence was threatened, and what form that assistance should take. Although the consequences of the Soviet Union's actions on the European situation cannot be predicted, general criticism from various newspapers recognizes that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are making good progress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] According to sources here, Britain and France have notified the Soviet Union that they are willing to conclude a trilateral military mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 20th] Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a speech in the House of Lords yesterday, providing a summary of the purpose of British foreign policy, and denying that the British government's negotiations with certain European countries to provide guarantees of territorial security had any aggressive intent. The center of British government policy is to "maintain genuine world peace and protect the lives, property, and cooperative interests of British expatriates abroad." In the second part of the Foreign Secretary's speech, he stated that while the immediate goal of British policy is to form a united front against aggression, it is also striving to avoid disrupting the status quo. Negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are underway, and significant progress is expected. The negotiations with Soviet Russia may include joint discussion of the Pacific issue. These friendly negotiations are hoped to conclude in an agreement soon.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 20th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has returned to his country to report to Stalin. Before Maisky returns to his post, there are unlikely to be any official announcements regarding the situation of the British-Soviet talks. The Soviet press says the British-Soviet talks are progressing well. The "Moscow News", which represents the Soviet external view, states that "Britain and the United States are now proceeding along the path of peace."</p>
<h3>Anglo-Turkish Agreement Already Officially Signed, Bulgaria Joins the Balkan Entente</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Sources here firmly assert that although officials from both Britain and Turkey deny it, Britain and Turkey have in fact reached an agreement to cooperate in anti-aggression movements. It is generally believed that this type of denial is required by Turkey, as Turkey urgently wants to keep the Anglo-Turkish agreement strictly secret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that regarding Turkey's joining of the collective security organization, representatives from Britain and Turkey have signed an agreement in the Turkish capital. However, out of respect for the Turkish government's opinion, it will not be announced for the time being. The significance of this agreement leans towards the military aspect. There are various technical clauses, such as stipulating that British warships have free passage through the Turkish straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. If it were to be leaked before the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are completed, it would be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] According to news from the Bulgarian capital, Bulgaria, under pressure from Turkey, has now agreed to join the Balkan Entente. If so, then this entente should be changed to a defensive alliance treaty. As soon as Romania is invaded, Bulgaria should allow Turkish troops to pass through its territory to provide assistance. Regarding this, Bulgaria is negotiating with Greece to obtain a sea route on the Aegean Sea as a condition for exchange. Diplomatic circles here are extremely excited upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>Intensifying the Anti-Aggression, British Cabinet Plans to Reorganize, Rumor that Churchill Will Hold an Important Position</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] It is reported that the British Cabinet has decided to reorganize. Conservative Party right-wing leader Churchill may be recruited into the Cabinet. According to reliable sources, the Cabinet has decided to establish a supply department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] People here firmly assert that although Chamberlain has worked hard in the past to carry out anti-aggression movements in Europe, he has never closed the door to a compromise with Germany and Italy. The decision to reorganize the Cabinet this time is in fact to recruit talent and increase strength, in order to intensify the expression of anti-aggression movements. Furthermore, Churchill's appointment to an important Cabinet position is sufficient proof that Chamberlain will abandon his dream of appeasement and carry out anti-aggression movements with strength.</p>
<h3>Bonnet Indicates that if Germany Attacks Danzig, Britain and France are Prepared to Aid Poland</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated in the Chamber of Deputies today regarding the Danzig issue that if Poland resists a German attack on Danzig, France must be forced to aid Poland. The protection of Poland, Romania, and Greece by Britain and France is not limited to the political independence of each country, but also extends to the territorial integrity of each country. The Minister of National Defense, following Bonnet, declared that France is prepared to deal with all contingencies, whether in the Mediterranean or in Africa.</p>
<h3>Situation in Gibraltar Still Tense, Spanish Troops Gathered Reaching 20,000, British Warships Transporting Troops to Increase Defense</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 20th] After a large number of fresh troops arrived here, the Spanish troops currently concentrated in the Gibraltar area have reached 20,000, most of whom are Moroccan troops. [Central News Agency, London, 19th] According to well-informed sources, the two battalions of British infantry that were sailing to Palestine on the warship Molster will land in Gibraltar and be stationed there. They will be replaced after the third batch arrives from Britain on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 20th] According to a semi-official organization here yesterday, regarding the report in some newspapers that the families of British residents in Malta have not been ordered to evacuate, only married officers and people in the Malta military camp have received instructions from the military authorities that, if they wish to move their families back to their home country due to the tense situation, they may do so at will.</p>
<h3>News from British Newspapers, Situation in Europe Relaxing, British Troops Aiding Greece Will Soon Return to Defend, Spain Guarantees Not to Invade Tangier</h3>
<p>[Haitong Agency, London, 19th] All newspapers here recognize that the overall situation in Europe has eased. At a minimum, the coming weeks can be passed peacefully. The "Daily Mail" has called special attention to the fact that the Spanish ambassador to France has provided guarantees to the French Foreign Ministry that Franco has not concentrated troops in Gibraltar and Spanish Morocco. The authorities in Tetuan, Spanish Morocco, have also stated that Spain has no intention of occupying the public area of Tangier. The Nazi Party headquarters in Danzig has published an article denying any intention to offer Danzig to Hitler as a gift for his fiftieth birthday, only giving him the honorary title of citizen of Danzig. The Army Department has announced that the troops transferred from Palestine to other locations to reinforce the British garrison in Greece will be transferred back to their original garrison locations. This has made a great contribution to the sudden sense of relaxation in the international situation. It is now scheduled for Hitler to give a speech on April 28th, and the newspapers are all speculating about it. Some newspapers believe that Hitler will make three types of demands, namely, demands for economic coordination, colonial issues, and the re-demarcation of borders. The last point refers entirely to Poland. The progress of the current Italian-Hungarian talks in Rome is being closely monitored by the British government. It is believed that both Italy and Germany want Hungarian-Polish relations to become closer and hope that Hungary and Romania can become closer. As for the current German-Romanian talks in Berlin, it is believed that the policies of the Axis countries have been developed. Greece has a great interest in the future actions of Germany and Italy. Political circles here believe that the Axis countries will take retaliatory measures against the democratic countries' guarantee system and the establishment of guarantee agreements.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] According to a Spanish news agency received by Reuters, the Spanish authorities in Tangier have provided absolute guarantees to the British Consul-General in the area, stating that rumors that Spain intends to occupy any land are unfounded, and that these rumors are "completely false and untrue". The Spanish authorities continued to announce that they were prepared to invite any foreign journalists to inspect the Spanish Moroccan territory to conduct on-the-spot investigations.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Birthday, Germany Celebrates Frantically, Goebbels' Broadcast Extravagantly Flatters, Britain and France Did Not Send Representatives to Congratulate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] Hitler got up at six o'clock this morning to prepare to accept the congratulations of the people of the whole country on his fiftieth birthday. A military parade will be held this morning. Countless people are carrying food and standing along the road. When the celebration ceremony began, the Hitler Black Guard played music in the garden of the Old Chancellery. At nine o'clock, Hitler reviewed the Black Guard in the New Chancellery. Half an hour later, the foreign diplomatic corps congratulated Hitler. Among them were former Czech Prime Minister Hacha and Slovakian Prime Minister Tiso. Led by General Göring, at least 23 foreign representatives participated. Britain and France did not send official representatives to participate in the celebration. However, two Britons, Major General Fuller and Sir Bullock, were Hitler's personal guests.</p>
<p>[Haitong Agency, Berlin, 20th] Today is the birthday of German leader Hitler. Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a special broadcast speech to the whole country, vaguely saying, "All countries in the world that have friendship with Germany must feel glorious along with the entire German people for this grand event. Even other countries that are arrogant and maintain an opposing attitude must have a deep impression of this important matter. Today, the name of the leader has been firmly established in the world because of his political achievements, and has spread far and wide like a myth. The division of the world's intellectuals into two major groups is also due to the name of the leader. I am afraid that there is no one in the world who can hear the name of the leader without being moved. Whenever today's world is involved, one cannot help but think of this great name." Goebbels also gave a brief review of Germany's progress over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] Japan has sent a telegram to Hitler to congratulate him on his fiftieth birthday.</p>
<h3>United States Appoints Ambassador to Spain</h3>

<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The official schedule for the British King and Queen's visit to the United States has now been announced. The British Royal Couple will stay at the White House in Washington for two days and one night as guests of President Roosevelt.

<h3>Ambassador Hu Shih Meets with the US President to Discuss General Issues in the Far East; Guo Taiqi Praises US Proposals; US Denies Appealing to Japan for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Chinese Ambassador to the US, Hu Shih, paid a morning visit to President Roosevelt. After the ambassador's departure, it was stated that general issues regarding the situation in the Far East were discussed with the President.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] US sources today denied reports from the Japanese side that the US President would make a peace appeal to Japan. It is claimed that this news circulating in Tokyo has no basis in fact as far as they know.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, speaking at a dinner party of the British and North American Association today, expressed great satisfaction that President Roosevelt's call for peace, whether in East Asia or Europe, is equally valued. Guo emphasized that China's firm resistance in this war for international political morality and democracy has kept the Axis powers' Far East partner busy and unable to care for much else. Today, China cannot afford to retreat even slightly; otherwise, world order will surely become even more chaotic.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Radio Address: Germany and Italy Have No Intention of War; Says Roosevelt's Proposal is Unfair; Germany, Italy, and Hungary in Separate Consultations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 20th] Mussolini delivered a radio address from the ancient Roman Palace here at 11:30 AM today, responding to Roosevelt's proposal. He stated that Roosevelt's proposal is clearly unfair, and it is inappropriate to falsely accuse the Axis countries of warmongering. The Axis countries have no intention of war, and the policies of Germany and Italy are aimed at maintaining peace, as proven by several past facts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in a radio address to the preparatory committee of the Rome Exhibition at City Hall today, stated, "The claim that the Axis countries desire war is completely untrue. We only wish to continue our work. Today, our country has begun mobilization. I hope that the people outside our country's borders will not be afraid, as this is merely an administrative mobilization of workers. Countries with only a preliminary understanding of the European situation have created a terrible geographical situation. The more people at the conference table for the governments of the Axis countries seeking peace and cooperation, the less likely it is to succeed." At this point, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Mussolini repeatedly proposed the slogan of "Peace and Justice."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 20th] According to reliable sources here, Mussolini will deliver a speech in Ogliolo tonight, before Hitler's speech next week, responding to Roosevelt's note. Arrangements have been made for nationwide broadcasting here. Fascist officials stated that this speech is extremely important.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 20th] Diplomatic activities here are extremely busy throughout the day. In addition to Mussolini's speech tonight, the Italian government's negotiations with Hungary are also attracting much attention. It is generally believed that the fate of Yugoslavia depends on these preliminary negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] The visit of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu here is highly valued by all parties. It is generally believed that although Germany is making every effort to draw Romania into the German-Italian Axis, the Romanian Foreign Minister has firmly stated that Romania will always maintain neutrality without wavering. Gafencu has met with Hitler and Ribbentrop. According to German sources, the Romanian Foreign Minister has assured Hitler that the British guarantee to Romania will never turn into a mutual assistance agreement, and that the anti-aggression agreements with Poland and the Soviet Union will not turn into a military alliance relationship.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] General Göring received Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu yesterday afternoon to discuss economic issues in the German-Romanian agreement for one hour. Before visiting Göring, Gafencu had lunch with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at his private residence.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 20th] Newspapers here continue to predict the content of Hitler's speech to the German parliament on the 28th of this month. According to opinions in French political circles, Hitler will present counter-demands, including the return of colonies. According to informed sources, the current negotiations are not expected to lead to any significant decisions, but close attention is being paid to the German-Romanian consultations in Berlin and the Italian-Hungarian talks in Rome. Political reporters from various newspapers believe that the future meeting between the Italian Foreign Minister and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister in Venice is very important, as Italy and Yugoslavia may establish an agreement or even form a three-nation military alliance with Hungary.</p>
<h3>British Shipping Faces Threat of Aggressive Warfare; Foreign Secretary Says He is Paying Full Attention</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] During a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords today, MP Stabolzi stated that there seemed to be warlike actions detrimental to British shipping. Foreign Secretary Halifax replied that the British government is paying full attention to this matter and has not forgotten its responsibility. However, in the current situation, he could not provide more details. The MP also asked whether the agreements concluded by the British government with other governments would be registered with the League of Nations. Halifax said that the government's goal is to act in accordance with the responsibilities conferred by Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the content of the concluded agreements should also be considered. Referring to the news of Spanish troop movements, the Foreign Secretary said that Spanish troops were indeed mobilizing, so news of troop movements was spreading, but there was no need to be alarmed by the troop movements.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Liverpool Balokeri Bin Shipping Company has decided that some ships sailing to the Far East will henceforth take the Cape of Good Hope route in South Africa instead of the Suez Canal. According to the company's staff, this move is to reduce war insurance costs. Previously, merchant ships from India and the Far East to the United States are now rerouted via South Africa. Ships heading to Britain will continue to use the Suez Canal, as the insurance costs in that area are not more expensive than via South Africa.</p>
<h3>US Congress Passes National Defense Bill; Establishes Naval and Air Force Bases; Trains Airplane Pilots</h3>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing; Crushing the Peace Plot of Traitors!</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 19th, stating that this return to Chongqing was only to handle routine diplomatic affairs and there were no other special missions. This fact can be regarded as a ruthless blow to the rumors recently spread by traitors about "mediating the Sino-Japanese War."</p>
<p>Now that the British Ambassador has returned to Chongqing, the first impression is that the important speech made by Chairman Chiang on the 17th reiterated China's unanimous determination to persist in unity and resistance, and clearly designated Wang Jingwei and his party's sympathy with Prime Minister Konoe's declaration and launching of "anti-communism" and "peace" as a traitorous act that "betrays the country and nation and abandons the people of the whole country." This is exactly the same as what the British Ambassador saw when he visited Chairman Chiang at the front line in Jiangxi in the past, with all the generals insisting on resistance and denouncing peace! Since the British Ambassador has a clearer understanding of the unanimous determination of the Chinese people to resist, he will surely make greater efforts to promote Sino-British friendship and to expand the anti-aggression front movement in the Far East with greater aid to China and restraint on Japan.</p>
<p>Whether viewed from the international situation or from China's needs, only China's firm resistance can achieve true independence and peace, and only China's firm resistance can achieve a true world order. As Ambassador Guo Taiqi said in his speech on the 19th of this month, "Today, China cannot afford to retreat even slightly; otherwise, the world order will surely become even more chaotic." Therefore, it can be proved that the conspiracy of all pro-Japanese traitors for anti-communism and peace mediation has absolutely no future! Their only result is the destruction of their words, actions, and themselves! However, their current conspiracies and poisonous schemes will inevitably be staged more fiercely and may cause considerable hindrance to our cause of resistance and national construction and the international anti-aggression front. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity at this time to carry out national diplomacy, launch a broad movement internationally to deal a fatal blow to all anti-communist and peace movements; at the same time, we must also intensify the national spiritual mobilization movement, enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, and make striking blows at pro-Japanese anti-communist and equalitarian remarks and actions, as one of the practical tasks of the current spiritual mobilization, in order to thoroughly clear the obstacles to the future of resistance, national construction, and the anti-aggression front.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Cope with Extraordinary Times: Government Departments Actively Equip for Air Defense; New Governor's Residence and Hospital of Government Departments are Adding Air Defense Facilities; Notice to Architects Urging Owners to Build Private Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>With the international situation becoming increasingly dangerous, the tragedy of a second global massacre is highly likely to reoccur today. Currently, countries in the East and West are busy with defensive preparations to cope with the coming war. The US fleet is preparing to enter the Pacific, and the British and French fleets have concentrated in the Mediterranean to prevent any eventuality. At the same time, Britain is paying great attention to the defense of the Far East, actively making necessary preparations. According to the Western News, the new Governor's Residence in Magassian, which began construction this winter, is being designed by engineers from the Public Works Department to add various air defense facilities. Plans for protecting Hong Kong's hospitals during air raids are also being drafted, and plans are being made to add beds in each hospital to accommodate civilians injured in air raids. Major buildings in Hong Kong have been designated as communication points for reporting disasters in emergencies. New hospitals built in Hong Kong should have dissecting rooms and patient rooms located underground. Although the Hong Kong government currently does not have explicit regulations requiring architects and engineers to design and build air defense facilities when constructing residential buildings, new buildings of the Hong Kong government and various government departments are required to have such facilities. The authorities only notify architects, urging them to encourage owners to pay attention to building private air raid shelters. There have already been several cases of this. It is difficult to emulate the steel air raid shelters used in Britain in Hong Kong, as this type of air raid shelter can only be built in open ground or gardens and is not suitable for building indoors.</p>
<h3>Members of the Women's War Relief Association Bravely Go to Shenzhen in the Rain to Comfort Wounded Soldiers; Chairman Liu Qingxuan and a Group of More Than Ten People Distribute Clothing, Milk, and Other Comfort Items</h3>
<p>After the launch of our Eastern Front counter-offensive, in addition to treatment in field hospitals, it is reported that more than a hundred wounded soldiers will be transported back to Shenzhen hospitals for treatment. These wounded soldiers are serving the country loyally, and the people in the rear should comfort them. The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association yesterday dispatched all its members to comfort them with underwear and milk. They crossed the sea at 12 noon and departed by car. In addition to Chairman Tan Liu Qingxuan, the group included Chen Rongxi Yun, Liang Lu Zhiping, Mrs. Li Zuyou, Xiao Shaoqing, He Chu Bi, Gong Yuqing, Liang Xingfang, Zhang Bu Xiuyi, Mrs. Liang Qiufan, and medical officers Chen Bao Cong, Li Dezhang, and Ruan Zhaowen, totaling more than ten people. They arrived at 4 PM and immediately went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. However, there were only six wounded soldiers currently staying in Shenzhen, and another fifteen had already been receiving treatment in the hospital, for a total of twenty-one new and old patients. The association distributed comfort items to them, including two sets of underwear, one set of outerwear, and two cans of milk for each wounded soldier. The remaining items were stored in the hospital and entrusted to the caregivers to distribute when more wounded soldiers arrive. After all matters were completed, they left the hospital and returned to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Hong Kong Industries is Organizing a Macau Manufacturers Research Association; Inspection Tour to Southeast Asia to be Discussed After Re-election; Urges the Kowloon Electricity Company to Reduce Electricity Bills</h3>
<p>The Federation of Hong Kong Industries held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, chaired by Ye Lanquan and recorded by Han Suisun. The items discussed and resolved included: (1) The issue of Hong Kong manufacturers setting up factories in Macau will be carried out after the establishment of the Hong Kong-Macau Manufacturers Research Association. (2) Start organizing the Hong Kong-Macau Manufacturers Research Association and discuss the articles of association with Macau businessmen. (3) Donate 500 sets of short shirts and pants to the Guangdong Comfort Association with the Electrical Appliance Merchants Association. (4) Organizing a Southeast Asian inspection tour will be discussed again after the re-election during the day. (5) Urge the Kowloon Electricity Company to reduce electricity bills. According to another source, after inspecting Macau, the manufacturers were favorably impressed by the low wages in Macau and the preferential treatment given to manufacturers by the Macau government. Most manufacturers still consider these three points: (1) Macau is superior to Hong Kong in terms of low wages. If there is no war in South China, manufacturing goods in Macau for sale in the mainland is possible. However, today the South China war zone is spreading and expanding, and the mainland market has narrowed. Even if the war stops, goods imported from Macau into the mainland are regarded as foreign goods and are subject to import taxes. Setting up factories in Macau may not be better than in Guangdong mainland. (2) Goods manufactured in Hong Kong and shipped to British territories can enjoy preferential taxes, but the Portuguese colony is small. (3) The land in Macau is sandy and unsuitable for many types of factories (especially textile factories). For these reasons, manufacturers believe that it requires consideration.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Children's Welfare Society Will Sell Flowers Tomorrow to Raise Funds for Refugee Children; Major Community Organizations First Conduct Indoor Sales in Yongnei; Student Relief Association Sends 600 Students to Serve</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong branch of the Wartime Children's Welfare Society has accommodated more than 400 refugee children from various places over the years. The monthly expenses required are enormous, so it is scheduled to hold a flower sale tomorrow (the 22nd) to raise funds. In order to increase charitable income, the association first sent flowers to various Chinese-funded banks and companies throughout Hong Kong for indoor sales, and the response was extremely enthusiastic. At the same time, all students of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association sympathize with the refugee children who fled to Hong Kong due to the war, so they specially mobilized 600 students to depart at 8 AM tomorrow (the 22nd), leading 200 refugee children from the association to sell flowers to shops, restaurants, and teahouses to raise charitable funds widely.</p>
<h3>Three Robberies Occurred in Hong Kong and Kowloon Within Several Hours Yesterday Morning; Six Thieves Rob a Taxi Company and Loot Hundreds of Dollars; Doorman Robbed and Then Gold Teeth Removed</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of banditry is rampant in Hong Kong, and armed robberies continue to occur. Three robberies occurred in succession yesterday morning within seven hours, and the bandits all escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>Six Masked Thieves Break In to Commit Robbery</p>
<p>(1) Tan Jiehui, 35, an employee of the Shanghai Taxi Company at 33 Wong Nai Chung Road, was auditing accounts at 4:50 AM yesterday morning, while three of his companions were sleeping in the building. Suddenly, a large man extended a gun from the window and threatened him, forcing him to open the door. Under duress, Tan opened the door, and six masked bandits rushed in with three guns, forbidding Tan from making any noise. They then searched and looted for about 20 minutes, taking HK$250 and fifty silver cents before escaping. After the thieves left, his companions were still fast asleep. Tan quickly reported the case by telephone, but the telephone line had been cut by the bandits. He then went out to take a taxi to Seymour Road to report to the owner, but the taxi No. 96 parked outside the door had also been driven away by the bandits. He was forced to walk to the police station to report the case. The taxi was only found at noon.</p>
<p>Maid Screams and Luckily Repels Robbers</p>
<p>(2) Three bandits broke into 101 Argyle Street, Mong Kok, yesterday. Afterwards, according to the maids Ye Huanlan (17 years old) and Ye Jie (46 years old), who went to the police station to report the case, the owner of the house went out with his family this morning (yesterday), leaving only the two of them at home. Suddenly, they heard someone knocking on the door, so they opened the door to welcome them in. Unexpectedly, three large men, each holding knives and guns, revealed their weapons and threatened them after entering the door. Knowing that their intentions were not good, she shouted loudly. Knowing that the matter had been exposed, the thieves pushed her down and rushed out of the door, so there was no loss or injury.</p>
<p>After Robbing, Gold Teeth are Extracted</p>
<p>(3) Tan Yu, 45, lives at 201 Shanghai Street, 2nd Floor. He is the doorman of Anli English Firm on Hung Hom To Kwa Wan Road. At 3:45 AM yesterday morning, while he was on duty, four unarmed bandits sneaked into the firm and intimidated him, stuffing his mouth with something. As a result, all the one dollar, one dime, and seven cents he had on him were robbed. One thief was still not satisfied and even used pliers to pull out his gold front teeth before fleeing.</p>
<p>Pickpockets Active on Trams and Buses</p>
<p>In addition, pickpockets have been very active on trams and buses recently, engaging in their skills on general passengers, or tailgating and looting by chance. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a tram number, traveled from Causeway Bay straight to Qu Di Street. At that time, a woman in her forties, accompanied by a boyfriend in his twenties, boarded the front of the tram from Wan Chai to Central. While the tram was traveling, the woman took out a large bill from her arms, including bills of one hundred dollars, fifty dollars, ten dollars, and five dollars, and loudly showed the numbers again and again. She then gave several hundred-dollar and fifty-dollar bills to her young boyfriend. Unexpectedly, when the tram reached the station in front of Wing On Company in Central, the woman and the young man got off the tram. A thief among the passengers followed them off the tram. As they were getting off the tram, they were only walking down the small steps, and because the tram was not yet stopped, everyone did not dare to jump off.</p>
<p>Showing Off Money in the Tram, a Huge Sum is Stolen</p>
<p>The thief, seeing an opportunity, rushed to get off the tram. When he squeezed close to the young man, he took out a knife blade, cut through the young man's pocket, and snatched a bundle of banknotes from the pocket, about 275 yuan, and quickly jumped into the street and fled into the nearby cross streets. When the thief made his move, it was quite forceful, and the young man immediately noticed it and exclaimed, intending to pull the thief tightly, but the sound was not finished, and the thief had already jumped off and escaped, leaving him only to sigh helplessly.</p>
<h3>Women's Comfort Association: Costume Ball Tonight at the Hong Kong Hotel</h3>

<h3>Wounded Soldiers in Shenzhen: A Brave Warrior in the Hospital Talks About the Scene of Attacking Wanchang</h3>
<p>It was a gloomy, cloudy sky, with continuous drizzle. I stepped onto a muddy, winding path. The rain hit the mud road and splashed up, wetting my shoes, socks, and pants. Gusts of strong yet seemingly weak easterly winds blew the rain sideways, hitting my face as it flew past the edge of my hat. But I managed to run to the front of a temporary wounded soldier shelter in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>"I am here to visit the wounded and loyal warriors," I said to a young and lively nurse, dressed in neat and snow-white clothing, who greeted me with a smile and led me inside. She said as she walked, "Yes, for the past two days, several representatives from Hong Kong women's groups have been sent to express their condolences to them. The first group was the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association, represented by Wu Yanzhuang, He Yuzhen, and Xu Wanjun. The second group was the Chinese Women's War Relief Association, represented by Liu Qingxuan, Rong Xiyun, and Lu Zhiping. This really makes them—the wounded soldiers—feel infinitely excited."</p>
<p>In the spacious hall, lay six wounded warriors, all severely injured. I thought, if they unfortunately die, they have already become martyrs. Originally, over a hundred brothers with glorious wounds had been transported there from a certain place in the past few days, but the heavy rain and traffic congestion made it impossible for medical aid to keep up with the rapid needs. On this point, I know that we in the rear feel extremely ashamed towards the loyal and brave warriors. It is said that the wounded are not easily healed if they are soaked in rain. We hope that the sun will soon appear in the clear sky so that more than a hundred wounded soldiers from a certain place can be transported in difficult conditions to Shenzhen in the rear, or to safe Hong Kong. Yes, in addition to the several wounded soldiers in the Shenzhen shelter, seven more seriously wounded soldiers had already been sent to Kowloon Hospital two days ago.</p>
<p>I noticed one of the six wounded soldiers who was less severely injured. He was lying in a corner, holding a newspaper in both hands and reading intently. I finally started talking to him. He thanked me for my condolences and respect and recounted a glorious and splendid battle to me.</p>
<p>"It was a dark night, and the hazy moonlight vaguely revealed the shadows of trees in the fields. The surroundings were silent, making the faint sound of frogs seem loud. More than a hundred of our brothers set off from Liaobu. Before departing, the officers gave us many encouraging instructions, ordering us to sneak into Dongguan County and kill the enemy's heads one by one. We finally entered the enemy's outpost from the South Gate of Wancheng at around 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>"Two gunshots suddenly shattered the silent surroundings. We knew that this was the order given by our company commander, telling us to charge and shoot together."</p>
<p>"The enemy was caught off guard. We swept over them, and for a long time, we didn't hear any sound of counter-fire. We charged towards one goal, which was the enemy's headquarters!"</p>
<p>"After about ten minutes, the enemy fired back. We concentrated our firepower and swept over them. After a while, we couldn't hear any more gunshots from that side. We finally charged to the enemy's headquarters. Ah! the brothers shouted. They discovered a cannon more than a foot long in front!" In the dark night, we couldn't see what kind of cannon it was, but several of us only thought of moving it away. However, even when we gathered ten or so brothers, we couldn't move it."</p>
<p>"The brothers continued to advance. After about twenty minutes, the enemy's firepower suddenly became dense. We knew that the enemy reinforcements had arrived, so we began to retreat. But we would never forget the enemy's cannon. We immediately pulled out several hand grenades and blew it to pieces."</p>
<p>"Were you injured in this battle?" I asked, pointing to his bandaged foot, interrupting the conversation.</p>
<p>"No, I retreated safely that day," he replied quickly. "I was injured in Liaobu because the enemy launched a large-scale attack on Liaobu, where our Security No. × Regiment's No. ×× Company was located, two days later. The enemy had three joint detachments this time. This fierce battle lasted for five or six hours. Although we were outnumbered, we were used to fighting anyway. If you say that we are brave, I would rather say that fighting is our daily routine."</p>
<p>"After half a day of fierce fighting, Liaobu was finally taken back by us!" The soldier said these words, stretched his waist, and the tense expression on his face immediately disappeared. I comforted him a few more times, wished him a speedy recovery, and shook his rough hand tightly!</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm too bored here. I want to go back to the front line. It's not right for the doctor to say that I need to rest for a while longer!" On the way back, I constantly felt the greatness of this soldier's words!</p>

<h3>Murder Case on Reclamation Street: Liang Zhi and Cai Anzai Both Sentenced to Death; Judge McElligott Acknowledges Extreme Cruelty of the Two Defendants; Seven Robbers Sentenced to Three Years of Hard Labor</h3>
<p>Liang Zhi and Cai Anzai, previously accused of committing a crime on the fourth day of last month, were charged with murdering a man named Huang Jingxiang, also known as Huang Jingzai, on Reclamation Street in Yau Ma Tei. The case was continued in the High Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, presided over by Justice McElligott, who convened a jury of seven members: Bidder (foreman), Pan Guihui, Chen Zilin, Chen Longji, Ya Xian, Zhong Jincun, and Chen Shuhua. Both defendants pleaded not guilty. Lawyer Hong Huizhao deferred to Barrister McNamarra to represent the first defendant, and Lawyer He Xun deferred to Barrister Anderson to represent the second defendant. After the court session began, the first defendant testified, followed by the second defendant. Subsequently, the prosecuting lawyer, Wei Yi, presented his views to the jurors. Next, Barrister McNamarra, representing the first defendant, and Barrister Anderson, representing the second defendant, presented their views. Finally, Judge McElligott reviewed the case details and instructed the jurors on how to make a decision. After the jurors retired to deliberate, they returned and unanimously found the defendants guilty. The judge, following precedent, cautioned the defendants, saying that the deceased was drinking tea in the tea house with his back to the street when you harmed him from behind, leaving him with no power to resist. This was extremely cruel. Consequently, the two defendants were sentenced to death. In addition, Judge McElligott of the High Court also made rulings on two criminal cases this month. They are as follows: (1) Xu Zhang, Shi Xi, and Hong Guoxiang were accused of conspiring to rob Chen Jinhong of a watch, Zhang Jin of a gold bracelet, Zhang Qin of a bracelet, a gold ring, and a watch on March 14 in Yau Ma Tei. (2) Four teenagers, He Jia, Lin Quan, He De, and He Su, were accused of robbing a woman, He Xiufang, of a handbag, a bracelet, a watch, and a ring on Kennedy Road on the evening of December 11 last year. All defendants pleaded guilty without hesitation. The judge sentenced each person to three years of hard labor, plus twelve rattan beatings.</p>

<h3>Luo Xuhuai Will Personally Investigate and Improve the Incident of a Pregnant Woman Beaten to Death in a Refugee Camp; Expresses Importance to Reporters Regarding This Unfortunate Incident; Security Issues Also Discussed with the Police Authorities</h3>
<p>Since the incident of a pregnant woman being beaten to death in the Kam Tin Refugee Camp, people from all walks of life have expressed extreme regret over this unfortunate incident.

<h3>Battle in Dongjiang Continues; Over a Thousand Enemies Annihilated Between Pai Tan and Xiaobu; We Have Formed an Arc-Shaped Line to Encircle the Enemy; Our Troops in Zengcheng Firmly Defend Kengk'ou and Liangtian</h3>
<p>[Boluo Correspondence] Since our large-scale counteroffensive, close contact has been achieved, and we have completed an arc-shaped encirclement, controlling Guangzhou. The enemy chief is deeply afraid that Guangzhou is in danger, and is trying to seize the major strongholds on the outer lines. They are rapidly concentrating their main forces to attack in the Zengcong area. The latest situation of the enemy's and our battles in the past one or two days is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Enemies Annihilated in the Xiaobu Mountains</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, the enemy troops from Taipingchang Jiufolong in the Congbai branch of the Guanghua Highway, whose reinforcements of about six or seven thousand men arrived yesterday, divided into three routes to invade Paitan and Dongdong. Our 12th Army Group headquarters in Guancun, Conghua Ao, Dajing Jun, and Foziao respectively fought back head-on, killing many enemies. The fierce battle lasted until dusk. Most of the enemies gathered near Paitan Xiaobu and launched a fierce attack on us. They engaged in a fierce battle with the main force of our ×× Division. The battle lasted all night. On the morning of the 18th, our troops from Zengcheng arrived and attacked the enemies from both sides. The enemies were defeated and fled in disorder towards Taipingchang. Our army followed closely and pursued them, circling Dahe Guling and approaching Taipingchang. In a flash, over a thousand enemies were killed in this battle, and many were wounded and captured. Corpses were everywhere. Over three hundred officers and soldiers of our army also died heroically.</p>
<p>Our Troops in Zengcheng Firmly Hold Kengk'ou</p>
<p>After Zengcheng was recaptured by our army a few days ago, our frontline troops held the Zengbo Market Danqiu Market and Zhucun Zhongxin Market, preparing to advance towards Guangzhou. The enemy chief, fearing that the battle situation in Guangzhou would be unfavorable, tried to seize the major strongholds of Zhucun Zengcheng and launched a large-scale invasion. Fierce battles between our troops and the enemies took place in the above-mentioned areas on the 16th and 17th. Our troops suffered heavy casualties. On the afternoon of the 17th, our army retreated to a favorable position for tactical reasons. The Zengcheng garrison moved south to Lizhiao and north to Kengk'ou. The Zengcheng enemy troops are still under the control of our Lizhi army, who can cross the Zeng River at any time and eliminate the enemy in Zeng. The Zhucun Danqiu Market moved north to the Liangtian new position, forming a confrontation with the enemy. Zhongxin Market crossed the Fucong Highway and defended Fuhe. Our troops are still holding each other in this area. Our troops are still creating an arc-shaped encirclement by holding various strongholds.</p>
<h3>Fresh Troops Arrive at the Front Line One After Another; We Will Launch Another Large-Scale Attack on Jiangmen and Xinhui; Guerrilla Troops Once Entered Jiangmen and Engaged in Street Battles with the Enemy; Our Team Is Strong Enough to Control the Enemy's Fate</h3>
<p>[Zhongshan Express News] According to military news, our army has achieved a time victory in the Jiangdou battle. The strength and front lines have been replenished and adjusted. Our fresh troops, a certain Gui army and a certain army, have also arrived in Sanbu and joined the front line. Deng Longguang's troops have also detoured from Xinhui Road from Shaping Hecheng Zhaitang and Tongjing and are actively advancing towards Xinhui and Jiangmen in conjunction with the 5th District Guerrilla Detachment and the Security Team. They have launched many raids on the two places in the past few days, which have yielded considerable results. It is expected that the Jiangmen-Xinhui battle will start again in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Advancing into Jiangmen and Attacking Xinhui City</p>
<p>After our army advanced along the Xin-Kai Road to Du Ruan, it continued to advance towards Jiangdou. The enemy learned that our army was approaching and, in order to prevent our army from advancing, launched an attack on the advancing troops in Du Ruan on the evening of the 17th. That night, our army fought fiercely in Du Ruan. The enemy was not good at night battles. After three hours of fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated. On the morning of the 18th, the enemy counterattacked us again, bombarding our positions with artillery non-stop. Our army resisted the danger and fought each other for about two hours. It rained heavily, and our army braved the rain to attack the enemy's front, rushing into the enemy's position and annihilating more than 30 enemies. The enemy was defeated and fled. Therefore, our army is still holding Du Ruan, preparing to continue to advance into Jiangmen. In addition, after our army gave up the Fen Shui position, the enemy repeatedly tried to invade us along the Xinkai Highway and the Ningyang Railway, but were all repelled by our army. On the 18th, after the elite troops of our army arrived at the front line, the military prestige was greatly enhanced and the morale was high. We sent a certain security country unit and a self-defense team to attack Xinhui. They once rushed into Gangzhou Station, defeating the enemy outside the city and annihilating more than 100 enemy soldiers. Now the enemy is desperately defending the northeast gate of the city, preventing us from rushing into the city.</p>
<p>Counterattack Imminent and Guerrillas Active</p>
<p>Li Wuzi, commander of the 5th District Column, in order to assist the army in carrying out a counterattack as soon as possible, has sent deputy commander Zhou Hanling to lead the ×× and other teams to mix into the villages in the Shitou Zhuang Tangxia area of the 5th District, and force Jiangmen. Another unit is using guerrilla tactics to the fullest in the villages of Da Xiao Mei Xinsha Di Xiangshan near Xinhui City, turning the enemy's position into a battlefield, and mobilizing the armed masses to participate in the war. According to statistics, there are no less than three to four thousand guerrilla teams in Jiangmen and Xinhui, with strong strength, which is enough to control the enemy's fate. On the evening of the 17th, more than 30 of our plainclothes team members once raided Jiangmen City and engaged in fierce street battles with the enemy, killing more than 20 enemy fakes. Seven of our people also died heroically. After this battle, the enemy's inspection of pedestrians was very violent. If there was anything suspicious, they would be tortured to vent their anger.</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes and Warships Are Peering at the Coastal Areas of Southern Guangdong; Enemy Warships at Bailongwei Are Surveying Waterways; All Counties Ordered to Destroy Highways Immediately</h3>
<p>[Southern Guangdong Express News] Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong is close to the sea, so the situation is uncertain. According to military authorities, the enemy has always had ambitions for the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong. However, our active counterattacks on the eastern, western, and northern routes have been victorious, and the enemy is already struggling to cope. It is expected that they will not be able to invade. Although there are still enemy warships and enemy planes intruding overseas, it is only to contain us and will not be a large-scale operation. The latest situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Peering</p>
<p>Enemy warships are often found in the coastal areas of southern Guangdong. On the 15th, two enemy shallow-water warships and several electric boats were suddenly found at Bailongwei and Qisha in Fangcheng, patrolling back and forth. On the same day, three dark gray enemy warships also sailed to the sea off Xuwen. After a while, they sent two electric boats to approach the coast for reconnaissance, seemingly to survey the depth of the water. In the afternoon, one enemy plane continued to fly to the county seat and hovered over the coast at low altitude for reconnaissance for 40 minutes before flying back to the warship. Currently, one enemy aircraft carrier is parked in the sea off Weizhou Island. It is said to be the Noto Ro-go. Enemy planes that have been flying to the two provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan and the various counties in southern Guangdong have mostly taken off from the warship and the Weizhou Island airport.</p>
<p>Destroying Highways</p>
<p>Most of the counties in southern Guangdong have reached the predetermined standards for conscripting laborers to destroy highways. However, there are still many places where the destruction is not thorough. Now, the counties of Xuwen, Qinlian, and Hepu have been ordered by the provincial government to continue to thoroughly destroy them, so that the opportunity for mechanized units to move will be eliminated. In addition, in order to assist the government in eliminating traitors and preventing spies from mixing in and collecting military intelligence, the people of various counties have formed a joint defense association to promote various tasks.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Madly Bombard Liancheng; Details of Losses; Targeting Liancheng Hospital, Heavy Losses; Six Bombs Hit Zongjiang, Destroying Houses and Causing Many Casualties</h3>
<p>[Southern Guangdong Express News] Qinlian, Fangcheng, Hepu, and other places in southern Guangdong have been repeatedly bombed and ravaged by enemy planes. Cultural institutions, charitable organizations, and even civilian residences have all been targets of enemy planes. A brief report was published in the newspaper on the 13th. The details of the enemy plane's atrocities and losses on that day are recorded in detail as follows: On the 13th, the Air Defense Command learned from the Beihai Air Defense Monitoring Post that enemy planes were invading, so it issued an air raid warning. At 2:30 PM, an emergency alarm was issued. After a while, eight enemy planes took off from Weizhou and advanced towards Liancheng. Three of them flew to Zongjiangkou, and the remaining five broke into the city sky, wantonly dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. Our air defense forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy planes raged for more than ten minutes before fleeing. As a result, 12 bombs were dropped in Liancheng and 6 bombs were dropped in Zongjiangkou. The losses are as follows: The enemy planes broke into Liancheng and targeted the Liancheng Hospital, dropping six bombs. Three bombs hit the hospital, hitting the reception room on the second floor, the special ward to the right, and the maternity room, each hitting one bomb. All three halls were destroyed. The hospital director and staff fled to the bomb shelter and were fortunately not injured. The hospital was founded in 1935, and the total construction cost was more than 50,000 yuan. It was first bombed on February 12, but the losses were minimal. This time, the estimated losses, including medicines, equipment, and furniture, are worth more than 10,000 yuan. After the enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the hospital, they flew to North Hetang on the street and dropped a total of six bombs. One bomb hit Wu Helong soy sauce shop at No. 26 Hesh Street, and the rear seat collapsed. One bomb hit the Liu residence at Nos. 20, 24, 22, 30, 32, 34, and 18 to the left, destroying the houses at Nos. 12, 14, and 16. The remaining four bombs fell in North Hetang, with no losses. Zongjiangkou is a small township and has no defenses. The enemy planes dropped a total of six bombs there. One bomb hit Luo's residence at No. 101, and the gatehouse was completely destroyed. One bomb each hit the front and back of the house at No. 72, completely destroying it, and affected Deng's residence at No. 73, and injured two children, Zhou Naiyun and Chen Wenfen, and killed an old woman. One bomb each hit the right side and the foot of Luo's watchtower at No. 24. The watchtower shook and was about to collapse. One bomb hit the main hall of the elegant house next to the watchtower, and the house was completely destroyed. In addition, the enemy planes dropped bombs and indiscriminately fired machine guns. A girl, Chen Ya, was shot and killed by an enemy plane. Two other villagers were injured.</p>
<h3>As Our Counterattack Continues Fiercely, the Enemy Prepares to Withdraw from Guangzhou; Enemy Dependents Have Already Evacuated to Hong Kong; Guangzhou-San Railway and Baiyun Airport Have Been Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Outside the Guangzhou Shameen] Since our various armies have actively launched a counterattack against Guangzhou, they have been unstoppable. After Zengcheng, Huaxian, and Conghua were recaptured, we took advantage of the victory to press on towards the enemy. As a result, Shilong was also recaptured by us yesterday. In order to save the crisis, the enemy drew various troops from various rivers to return to aid. Therefore, the battles between the enemy and us have been extremely fierce in recent days. Both sides have tried their best to seize every small stronghold. Although the enemy used its fierce artillery fire, our armies were determined to die without the enemy, and they advanced one after another with extraordinary courage. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we surrounded Guangzhou on three sides. In order to cope with our counterattack, the enemy chief Matsui secretly went to Sanshui some time ago and held an important meeting to discuss the strategy of offense and defense. It is said that the result was a unanimous decision to draw back the enemy troops from various rivers to defend the city and wait for reinforcements, and to abandon Guangzhou when necessary. Therefore, the enemy has been actively strengthening the defenses along the Hudu line in recent days in preparation for retreat when necessary. Many supplies have also been transported away. A large number of enemy officers and dependents of the business delegation accompanying the army came to Hong Kong some time ago and are now staying in a certain hospital in Wan Chai, numbering about a hundred people. From this point of view, the enemy actually intends to abandon Guangzhou. In addition, the various guerrilla teams in our suburbs are now encircling Guangzhou with our regular armies in order to support our counterattack. As a result, they have been active everywhere. The Guangzhou-San Railway and Baiyun Airport have been destroyed by our guerrilla teams. The enemy troops are extremely panicked, and there is a great sense of impending doom. Our new air force has been attacking Guangzhou for days, which has made the enemy sleepless. They are now preparing to withdraw from Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Film and Drama: New Invention in Hollywood; Special Film Makes Stars Look Younger; Merle Oberon Has Already Done the First Test</h3>
<p>News has spread that Hollywood movie stars will look younger and younger on the silver screen, and viewers will even want to make the stars' real ages lighter, because an unnamed scientist has invented a special film that is enough to increase the beauty of the stars on the silver screen.</p>
<p>This film is called Plus X. Film tycoon Samuel Goldwyn has resolutely done the initial test, with the film titled Wuthering Heights, starring</p>
<p>Merle Oberon, who has returned from England after acting in the color film "The Private Life of Don Juan", and Laurence Olivier and newcomer David Niven (who have starred in "The Prisoner of Zenda" and "The Charge of the Light Brigade").</p>
<p>This important new invention actually gives the film world great convenience in terms of light, and its results are the beautiful posture of the film actors that everyone will see.</p>
<h3>Hollywood: A Lineup of Great Directors</h3>
<p>— Continued</p>
<p>(4) Frank Capra: The creator of "It Happened One Night," "Lost Horizon," and "You Can't Take It With You." His art needs no introduction. He still has one film to shoot at Columbia, after which he will join the Goldwyn ranks.</p>
<p>(5) John Cromwell: Chinese audiences may not yet recognize him, but he has a long history in Hollywood. His "Little Lord Fauntleroy" was also highly acclaimed. Recent works such as "The Prisoner of Zenda," "Little Lord Fauntleroy," "The Prisoner of Zenda," and "Algiers," which premiered in Shanghai, have all received good reviews.</p>
<p>(6) George Cukor: Undeniably a master of drama. In the past, "Little Women," "What Price Hollywood?" and "Camille" earned countless tears of sympathy from audiences. His new work, "Zaza," tells the tragic story of a cabaret singer from the late 19th century. The star is Claudette Colbert, and it was released at the Cathay during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>(7) Michael Curtiz: Director of Errol Flynn's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and "The Adventures of Robin Hood," is skilled at handling tense war scenes and is popular among Hong Kong audiences. He occasionally makes comedies such as "The Perfect Specimen" and "This Is the Army." His greatest achievement is undoubtedly the literary film "Four Daughters."</p>
<p>(8) Roy Del Ruth: He is a great director of musicals. Those who like to watch soft films will naturally recognize him. His recent works include "Broadway Melody of 1936," "On the Avenue," "Wake Up and Live," "Sally, Irene and Mary," "Happy Landing," and "My Lucky Star." The fact that Sonja Henie jumped to third place among the top ten stars last year is also thanks to his efforts.</p>
<p>(9) Cecil B. DeMille: This director and producer is truly known to everyone. In the past, his works were themed around religion, such as "The Ten Commandments," "The King of Kings," "The Sign of the Cross," and "The Crusades." In the last four years, he has been filming American historical films such as "The Plainsman" and "The Buccaneer," and is about to complete "Union Pacific." The film tells the story of building the railroad in the United States after the Civil War. The protagonists include Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Akim Tamiroff, and over a thousand Chinese actors.</p>
<p>(10) Victor Fleming: His films are grand and moving. "Captains Courageous" and "Test Pilot" are the culmination of his year's hard work. His next film is "The Wizard of Oz," starring Frank Morgan and others.</p>
<p>(11) John Ford: He is a great director who won an Academy Award for "The Informer." Famous works include "The Little Colonel" and "The Champ." In 1938, his films such as "The Hurricane" and "Submarine Patrol" were very grand.</p>
<p>(12) Sidney Franklin: His works are few and far between. In recent years, he has only made "The Good Earth." It has been almost two years since "The Good Earth," and he has not had any new works.</p>
<p>(13) Tay Garnett: He likes adventure, and his works are also known for adventure and naval battles, such as "Trade Winds." After "Stand-In," he joined producer Walter Wanger. His new film "Trade Winds" stars Fredric March, Joan Bennett, and Ann Sothern. It is an aviation film with a background spanning the world.</p>
<p>(14) Henry King: In terms of reputation, Mr. King is truly second only to Frank Lloyd, because he has won the Academy Award twice in a row, once for his "Tol'able David" and once for his "State Fair" (starring Janet Gaynor). He single-handedly brought Tyrone Power to the peak of the silver screen because his performances in "Lloyds of London," "In Old Chicago," "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and "Jesse James" were truly excellent.</p>

<h3>Happy Angel (7)</h3>
<p>Harry glanced at her in surprise, thinking that she was the first obstacle he had encountered in his life.</p>
<p>"Even so... I brought you something," he handed it to her.</p>
<p>"What, what is this?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what it is, but it's a souvenir. Look, it says 'Souvenir of Omurhei' on it. This is the place you're leaving immediately."</p>
<p>Irene's hands trembled as she took the gift. "Why... why are you giving me a gift, Harry?"</p>
<p>He shrugged. "I don't know. It's contrary to my usual principles, Irene. You're the only person I've seen who makes me unable to answer myself."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am the only person who can make someone as great as you remember," she said gently.</p>
<p>"A great person, huh," he sneered contemptuously. "A great mediocrity, failing at everything, failing at everything. But, good heavens, you don't see it that way, because the world you hear about is not the real world. It's a world in a dream. Maybe that's why I find you lovely, Irene," he said, his eyes staring straight into hers.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she suddenly stroked his cheek with one hand. "Perhaps you are wrong, dear. Or perhaps we are two humble people, humble lives. Or perhaps we are the only two real people in this crazy world."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her blankly for a while, then suddenly, rudely, pulled her into his arms.</p>
<p>People at the station shouted that the train was leaving, and they were awakened from their long kiss.</p>
<p>"Looks like we have to say goodbye," Irene said.</p>
<p>"Yes, you go your way, and I'll go mine. But I have a feeling that we will meet again one day."</p>
<p>"Yes," Irene responded softly, their lips meeting again in a silent farewell.</p>

Subsequently, the Hong Kong side wrote to the Department of Education, which is in charge of women's softball in the Philippines.

<h3>Several of the Most Effective Body Exercises for Sleeping</h3>
<p>— Excellence</p>
<p>(3) Head, Back, and Leg Lift Exercise. As shown in the figure, lie supine on the bed with your legs straight and your hands tightly pressed against your hips. (1) As shown in the figure, lift your head, back, and legs simultaneously, inhaling. At this time, contract your abdomen tightly, trying to make the angle formed by your legs and torso as small as possible. The hips evenly support the weight of the whole body. (2) Slowly lower your head, back, and legs, exhaling. Do this twenty times in sequence to return to the original position.</p>
<p>(4) Push-up Exercise... As shown in the figure, keep your body straight, head up, and support your weight with your hands and toes on the pad. (1) Bend your elbows to press the weight of your entire body down. (2) Extend your elbows to return your body to the original position. Do this for one to four sets of eight counts, but keep your body and legs in their original state when doing it. Do not bend them. As for inhalation and exhalation, it should also be natural according to the rhythm of the movements. Do not stop.</p>
<p>(5) Leg Vibration Exercise. As shown in the figure, lie supine on the bed with your legs straight and diagonally lifted, with your feet about three feet away from the mattress. Place your hands tightly against your hips, and lift your head and shoulders slightly off the mattress. (1) When the left foot kicks down, the right foot kicks up. Do this up and down until you feel slightly tired and stop. Gradually increase the number of times from small to large. This exercise is slightly similar to the leg kicking when swimming freestyle. If you are used to this exercise, it will also help with freestyle. (6) Leg Bending Exercise... Bend your arms and lie supine on the bed, interlock your fingers and place them under your occipital bone. Lift your legs diagonally. (1) Bend your knees as shown in the figure for the left leg. At this time, the farther apart the knees are, the better, but the toes should be slightly closer together. (2) Forcefully straighten your legs outward, as shown in the left leg in the figure, and then forcefully bring them together. By bending and straightening them once, you can exercise your lower limbs and abdomen. This exercise is also somewhat similar to the foot movements when swimming breaststroke. If you are used to this exercise, it will also greatly help with breaststroke. Do about one to four sets of eight counts.</p>
<p>(7) Leg and Waist Exercise. Lie supine on the bed with your legs straight and tightly pressed against the mattress, and place your hands by your head. (1) Lift your upper body off the mattress as shown in the figure and press it down again. The closer your torso is to your legs, the better. (2) Slowly lean your upper body back down. Do one to four sets of eight counts.</p>
<p>(8) Waist Exercise. As shown in the figure, lie supine on the bed, interlock your fingers and bend your arms, placing them under your occipital bone. (1) Straighten your legs and lift them up and press them down as much as possible. The closer they are to your torso, the better. (2) Slowly return your legs to their original position. The effectiveness of this exercise is the same as the seventh section, but the movements are the opposite. Do one to four sets of eight counts.</p>
<p>(9) Breathing Exercise. Lie supine with your chest open and your hands placed by your sides. (1) Bend your waist, puff out your chest, and inhale. (2) Return your waist and abdomen to the original position, tighten your chest, and exhale. Continue to breathe in and out twenty times in sequence.</p>
<p>Note: Among the above eight exercises, you can first choose four according to your physical strength (other sections can be changed regularly). Do the exercises before going to bed and before getting up. After completing the four sections, add a breathing exercise to help you fall asleep or wake up easily. Each five exercises should be completed in ten to fifteen minutes. (Two)</p>

<h3>Idle Chat About Shark Fin</h3>
<p>— Bland</p>
<p>On the Subject of勸 (persuading) Not Eating Shark Fin — A Discussion of the True Nature of Shark Fin</p>
<p>Shark fin is a foreign import with remarkably high value, as everyone knows and needs no further description. When maritime trade was first opened, the supply was extremely limited, so officials and wealthy merchants used it as a way to entertain each other, needing this dish at banquets to display their prestige. Now, it has become a common dish at celebratory feasts; almost feeling stingy if there isn't a shark fin dish. This extravagant custom is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Shark fin is simply the fin of a shark, broadly divided into dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins. The spinal cartilage is the best in quality, followed by the pectoral and caudal fins. In terms of value, larger pieces are more expensive, while smaller ones are cheaper. What is sold in the market is already dried. If one wishes to cook and eat it, the process is extremely complicated. The first step is removing the sand, which involves placing the raw fin in boiling water to cook it (sometimes cold water is used, which takes longer). Then, it's taken out and the outer layer of floating sand is scraped off. This is the first step completed.</p>
<p>Next is cooking thoroughly. The sand-removed fin is cooked again until it becomes soft and glutinous. The duration of cooking depends on the size of the fin. It requires expertise, or it will remain hard and difficult to enjoy. Once cooked, it's rinsed in clean water, and any hard cartilage and rotten flesh are removed. But it's still bland and tasteless, quite similar to glass noodles. However, shark fin has resilience and some skin, making it fatty and rich upon entry to the mouth, whereas glass noodles do not. Thus, there are those who never tire of it and even regard it as a delicacy, simply chasing after an empty reputation without seeking real substance, wasting money in the process. Is it worth it?</p>
<p>The final step is seasoning. The cooked fin is steamed with original chicken broth, and then other ingredients like ham, crab roe, shrimp, mushrooms, and vegetable hearts are added according to the season. After skillful cooking, it becomes a fine dish. In reality, shark fin itself has no inherent flavor. Before maritime trade was opened, it was considered extraordinary simply because it was rare.</p>
<p>Here is a list of domestic and imported shark fin names, along with their prices, and an attached diagram for the reader's reference (Western shark fin production areas are Luzon, Pontianak, and Makassar).</p>

<p>There is also stacked fin, also known as cooked fin. In the past, the supply was plentiful, but after taxes increased and declared prices didn't match, local experts hired workers to remodel it and then sell it. Currently, the market price is $550 for long strips, $400 for single stacks, and $350 to $450 for fin cakes. The cooking methods are as described earlier.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also small shark fin, which comes from ordinary small sharks. Their meat is already used as food for the hungry. Restaurants and kitchens collect it. After being dried in the wind, it only needs to be prepared and cooked properly to be tender and delicious, no less than the giant fin. Those who are addicted to shark fin should try it.</p>

<h3>Changes in Shanghai Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>In February, only one business expanded, a decrease of two compared to the three in the previous month. The one that expanded was the Hengdeli Watch Company, which added a jewelry department.</p>
<p>There was one name change in February, the Zhejiang Zhongdetang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store changed its name to Jiang Zhongdetang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, one less than the two name changes in the previous month.</p>
<p>Twelve businesses closed down in February, all commercial enterprises, an increase of three compared to the nine in the previous month. Breaking down the twelve by industry: four in food and beverage, three in transportation, three others, and one each in clothing and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>There were 108 transfers of ownership in February, an increase of 23 compared to 85 in the previous month. This is because February falls around the time of annual closings, so naturally, there would be more transfers of ownership than in other months. Breaking down the 108 industrial and commercial enterprises by type, 21 were factories and 87 were commercial enterprises. The more important transfers were the disposal of Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng film companies and the operation of the American-owned China United Film Company. Of course, in the current environment, the difficulties faced by the film industry are self-evident. Classifying the 108 transfers of industrial and commercial enterprises by industry, the food and beverage industry had the most at 29, followed by clothing at 19, dyeing and weaving at 9, daily necessities at 9, cultural and other industries at 8 each, metal and fuel industries at 4 each, and finally the travel industry at 1.</p>
<p>There were 47 transfers of shares in February, including 9 factories and 38 commercial enterprises, an increase of 19 compared to 28 in the previous month.

<h3>On the Romanticism of Revolution</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>Realism and Romanticism are the two mainstreams of artistic creation in humanity. Realism is the creative attitude and method of artists approaching reality, pursuing reality, and correctly reflecting reality. Romanticism, on the other hand, is the creative attitude and method of artists departing from their subjective concepts, causing the artistic expression of objective reality to lean towards subjective fantasy.</p>
<p>To correctly reflect and grasp objective reality, and to pursue the most accurate method of expressing reality, actively examining the essence of reality, and expressing its diversity, contradictions, activity, and the inevitability of its development, an art must use realism, the highest critical achievement in the history of all human art, as its guiding creative method. It should use this scientific artistic methodology to calmly and meticulously examine all aspects of reality, analyze its various complex forms, to achieve the task of precisely reflecting reality. However, art not only requires a highly rational analysis of reality, but also a highly unrestrained passionate enthusiasm for reality. It must recognize, within reality, the ardent revolutionary Romantic ideals that stimulate the living feelings and practical intentions of the broad masses. In realistic art, the deep passion of Romanticism must be elevated. An artist needs not only precise and keen technique, not only realism, but also fervent emotion and sensitive touch, needs romanticism. Only through the organic integration of realism and romanticism can great art be created.</p>
<p>Speaking of Romanticism, the general public is prone to misunderstand it, thinking it is merely a method of artistic creation that demands strong stimulation and joyful emotion, while neglecting reality, despising reality, and transcending reality. In fact, romanticism is not necessarily anti-reality. Many times, it emphasizes and exaggerates one aspect of reality, or emphasizes possible future aspects of reality. Only when it is used by backward and dying groups does it become a means of opposing and escaping reality. Therefore, within romanticism, we can classify the following two tendencies: one is decadent, negative, and reactionary romanticism, and the other is progressive, active, and revolutionary romanticism. Gorky once said:</p>
<p>"Negative romanticism——is to beautify reality, to make people compromise with reality, or to pull people away from reality into an abyss without any results, into the world of what 'small understandable of life,' what love, what death, etc...into the mysteries of thought; positive (revolutionary—Jie Ru's note) romanticism is to strengthen people's will to live, and to arouse among people resistance to all the oppression of reality."</p>
<p>Gorky believed that negative, decadent romanticism is intuitive, corrupt, and fallen, merely indulging in the narrow inner world of the individual and the mire of disillusionment and sentimentality. Revolutionary romanticism, on the other hand, is progressive and social. It strengthens people's will and strives to arouse people's strong resistance to reality and all its oppressions. In general nature, romanticism carries a certain atmosphere of dissatisfaction with reality and opposition to reality. However, this dissatisfaction and opposition comes from a clear perspective on the development of reality. It does not contradict realism. Realism does not reject the elements of romanticism. It needs Romantic ideals and enthusiasm to illuminate the trend of historical reality. Revolutionary romanticism is not that kind of romanticism of backward classes, it is an essential attribute of realism, it is the fusion of realism and romanticism, entering dynamic realism as a winning component. Therefore, Gilbo Tin said in an article about "Socialist Realism," "The characteristic of revolutionary romanticism is inherent in socialist realism, only that different artists have differences in degree." "Revolutionary writers should strive to express the goals of the progressive people's struggle in various forms, praising revolutionary heroism, celebrating fighters and builders, foreseeing the true future and the thorough road ahead, and completing their revolutionary romantic creative tendencies within the scope of socialist realism."</p>
<p>The basic characteristic of revolutionary romanticism lies in its perspective on the future. All romanticism longs for the future, carrying a "future" fantasy. However, the concept of the future of those negative romanticisms is empty, absurd, intuitive, and dreamy; while the "future" of revolutionary romanticism is excavated from the continuous development process of reality, from the contradictions of reality and the possibilities of its development, standing on the foundation of reality. It has twelve thousand points of authenticity, development, and possibility. It is a future that can and will be realized. The creation of revolutionary romanticism is based on the depiction of realistic themes, indicating the accurate future of development, movement, and struggle, making it vivid with bright colors.</p>
<p>All great realist writers are revolutionary romantics. Realism and revolutionary romanticism are coordinated with each other. Gorky said the following: "For great writers such as Balzac, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Gogol, Leskov, and Chekhov, is it very difficult to determine whether they are realists or romantics? Great artists often seem to combine romanticism and realism." These words illustrate the inseparability between revolutionary romanticism and realism. A great realist is also a revolutionary romantic. In "Song of the Falcon" and "Song of the Stormy Petrel," Gorky is a realist, but also a great visionary. Therefore, they are unified and intertwined. Only the fusion of realism and revolutionary romanticism can give artistic works a high degree of emotional power.</p>
<p>Today's art demanded by China's reality is naturally the product of this fusion of revolutionary romanticism and realism. We need to critically accept the positive elements of past romanticism to create great revolutionary romanticism!</p>
<h3>Extinguishing Fires</h3>
<p>— Ge Er</p>
<p>If "fire" is a dangerous thing, then eliminating dangerous "fires," and ensuring that "fires" do not occur, is a very correct action, and at the same time a good deed that greatly contributes to the safety of mankind in the world.</p>
<p>However, the "fire player" thinks otherwise. He believes that the reason why "fire" becomes "dangerous" is because there are originally "combustibles" in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "fire player" believes that using "fire" to burn away "combustibles" is the only way to eliminate "fires." Because in his mind, if there were no such thing as "combustibles" in the world, wouldn't "fire" naturally disappear?</p>
<p>It is only natural that such a so-called "theory" from the "fire player" would cause "a strange feeling" when heard. The only reason why the "fire player" wants to issue such a seemingly correct but actually absurd statement is to cover up his "playing with fire" trick.</p>
<p>For example, when Hitler annexed Austria and swallowed the Sudetenland last year, the whole world was in a state of panic. Then Hitler, this skillful "fire player," issued a statement to Britain and the whole world: he had no territorial demands on the world! However, "fire" is "fire" after all. If you don't try to extinguish it, but instead avoid it out of fear, that won't work. Therefore, Czechoslovakia was swallowed up again, although Hitler had also declared to Britain and the whole world: Germany does not want to dominate other nations. "Well, the Czechs are not of Germanic origin!" However, Czechoslovakia is a "combustible"!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, look at what he said about the demise of Czechoslovakia? He said: "If Czechoslovakia does not oppress the Germans and become a tool of communism, then we will never take any action against the independent Czech state." This is Hitler's piece of loyalty to the fulfillment of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," and no one can say he is not. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, who was "preventing" communism, exposed the sham of this sentence: "The Anti-Comintern Pact is a term in geology." However, the most honest people in the world are none other than Hitler and Mussolini, and Japan, which promotes righteousness in the Far East. Everything that is not a "tool of communism" is "communism itself." Can their words be trustworthy? Therefore, Hitler's demise of Czechoslovakia is very proper, because "I believe that I have made a great contribution to peace, because I have eliminated a great danger in Central Europe." In this way, should people still call on God to thank our "God of Peace, Hitler?"</p>
<p>However, although the seemingly correct but actually absurd words of the "fire player" have once deceived some foolish people, when "fire" burns in front of people, anyone who is not wood or stone will jump up and try to put it out. "Fire" is a dangerous thing after all. Those who have been deceived by "fire players" in the past should wake up now. It's still not too late. In order to prevent the world from suffering from terrible "fires" again, I hope that no one in the world will believe a single word from the "fire player" again!</p>
<p>Let us all rise up and extinguish "fires"!</p>
<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Has anyone ever ridden in a small boat, drifting on the black sea, the long night boundless, a tiny life clinging tightly to the waves, rising and falling with the tides, filled with terror, sorrow, and hope, and finally, while longing for light, saw a red sun rising on the horizon, slowly ascending, slowly the whole universe becoming warm, is this joy less than the joy of rebirth?</p>
<p>It's the joy of light, you say, isn't it also the joy of rebirth?</p>
<p>Rain makes people depressed, fog makes people ignorant, and night makes people irritable. Has anyone ever suffered from insomnia? Even if it's only for a month or two, or a night or two, tossing and turning, tangled with a myriad of thoughts. Who can endure it? No sun, no light, no heat, not to mention no warmth, no joy. Trapped in the encirclement of the black night, people are often lonely, without companions, without echoes. Perhaps you scream because of the fearful phantoms, but afterwards, you may find that you were hoarse and silent.</p>
<p>Is there anything more lovely than the rooster's crow at this time? Before you have glimpsed the thin dawn, the clever harbinger has announced it for you. Don't worry about no light, no heat, no joy, no warmth. It's often a blessed good news. The tall treetops are smeared with a faint rouge, the vast sky reveals a layer of hazy fish-belly white, and the ever-changing sea reflects golden waves like fish scales.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have been trapped in nightmares, entangled by them, falling into danger, predicament, a state of weeping. When you are in distress, danger, or even weeping, suddenly a ray of morning light shines on your face from the window, containing infinite warmth. Half doubting, half believing, you hear the rooster's crow, and finally, you resolutely push away the dream. At this time, you see the rebirth of light, can you not be joyful?</p>
<p>However, please think about why you were not swallowed by the black night? You can see the light again, you are happy, but why are you blessed?</p>
<p>Aren't there many people crawling in the dark, gasping for breath, and collapsing silently? They crawl from the darkness towards the light, like climbing a tower, looking far at the spire, at the sunlight. Some gasp and say they have no strength to climb, willing to squat in the dark, and some are impatient to climb. They fall to the left and right, collapsing in every corner. Some people are the most unfortunate. They endured all night, fighting with the darkness countless times. Unfortunately, they were disappointed, at the end of the night, when the hourglass was running out, when they were about to see the tower ridge. They were swallowed by the dark and had no chance to see the sunlight again.</p>
<p>Long nights make people pessimistic. Moreover, there are many nightmares. They are afraid of the dark, and even more afraid of the dreams of the dark. Therefore, we long for sunlight. Sunlight gives us laughter and warmth.</p>
<p>Although it is only a gentle light, it is the source of light. After a long night of struggle, having not been swallowed by the black night, we finally hear the rooster's crow again. This is the first sound of joy in the world.</p>
<p>The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not fully opened. Some people hide in the dark, shouting for darkness. The time before sunrise is the most unsettling, because the night feels so long, even longer than midnight, even longer than the first watch of the night. Although there is sunlight, there is still darkness. Moreover, even before sunrise, there are still many people swallowed by the dark.</p>
<p>Only those who are always searching for the light can grasp the morning sun, and go forward to meet it, watching those clowns disappear one by one in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The rooster has crowed. But the dawn has not fully opened. Before sunrise, you need to be patient!</p>
<h3>Inkstone</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>At that time, I had just returned to my hometown not long ago, living the life of a recluse. All books that were contrary to my way of thinking had long been either discarded or burned. Only a copy of "Poems of Jiannan" remained with me, accompanying me in passing these painful days. Not long after the rain stopped, the entire courtyard was covered in mud. The hall that had been bombed on the other side of the courtyard had become a large pile of rubble. Even among the broken tiles, tiny sprouts of grass were pushing their heads out. Spring was everywhere, but my heart remained in winter, forever in a deep winter.</p>
<p>The child, covered in mud, spread out his hands and rushed in, shouting:</p>
<p>"The madman is here!" He circled around my desk, darted across the courtyard, jumped onto the pile of rubble, waved his hands, and looked towards this side.</p>
<p>I stood up and went to the door to greet him. A person with long hair staggered towards me, looking haggard, with a fixed gaze. He held something in his hand. His dirty old cotton robe was also splattered with mud. He nodded at me with a smile that was not quite a smile. I stepped aside slightly, and he stepped into the study with one foot. With a *plop* sound, a large puddle of water squeezed out onto the floor from his worn-out leather shoes. He sat down on the rattan chair by the door, smoothed his sleeves, and raised the object he was holding to his brow, saying:</p>
<p>"I've come to ask you for advice. Don't think of me as a madman. We're old neighbors." A wave of heat rose from his forehead and the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>I moved closer to look at the object in his hand. It turned out to be a covered inkstone. He gently placed it flat on the table, opened the lid, and with a dirty hand, he groped over the words on the lid. Gradually, some traces of writing emerged. As he rubbed, he said:</p>
<p>"You've been soaring high in your career and rarely come home, so we're not familiar with each other. But speaking of it, we're actually family friends and neighbors. Look, this inkstone was brought back by my grandfather when he was traveling abroad as an official. The inscription on it was written by your great-grandfather!"</p>
<p>"I've never understood why this poem is inscribed on the inkstone, and what the poem has to do with the inkstone. Look, 'Heavy curtains unrolled, linger long with fragrance,' it's clearly, 'curtains, not, unrolled, linger, fragrance, long,' good lines! But what does it have to do with the inkstone?"</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Snow of Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>She was born in Manchuria, grew up in Manchuria, and spent every winter of her life in Manchuria. For eighteen years, she had never seen such heavy snow. She had never imagined that she would be walking on a snow path, cut off at the foot of Shasha Mountain; the only way home was blocked. She stopped, hoping to find another snow path. Snow was still falling. This snow was not the familiar snowflakes she knew, but unfamiliar snow blocks, clouds of snow, that instantly filled the valleys and frozen streams. Travelers in this snow worried about being buried and trapped under the snow; the snow seemed to have already prepared a snow coffin for them. This astonishing snowfield, so similar to Manchuria, she didn't know, she was living in the city of Manchuria. So, she was frightened and trembled by this snow. Fortunately, she discovered several snow paths and chose one of them to walk on. Soon, the snow path was cut off again. Then, she switched to another one, continuing to switch countless times; but the end of each snow path was the same foot of the snow mountain. In an instant, she was trapped between the snow mountains, unable to find a single snow path, as if covered by a morning mist, a layer of night. She stopped again, unable to avoid panic. She looked around, nothing. On this strange and terrifying snowfield, she was the only one. At this moment, she heard someone calling, like her father's voice, and also like her mother's voice:</p>
<p>"Come back! Zhu Lin!"</p>
<p>But she couldn't see the shadow of a single traveler. The footprints left on this snow were all hers. Besides that, there were strange tracks; she gradually saw more and more, scattered everywhere she could see. She called out:</p>
<p>"Mama, what is this place?"</p>
<p>"That's where bears roam!" Bears are the most numerous and most dangerous animals in Manchuria. After hearing this, she immediately burst into tears. She grabbed onto a kind of voice that came from nowhere and called out:</p>
<p>"Then why don't you come and save me? Don't you want your daughter anymore? Mama, you can't be so cruel!" (43)</p>
