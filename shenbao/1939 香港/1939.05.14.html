<h3>戰後江蘇之教育</h3>
<p>— 馬放元</p>
<p>蘇省過去敎育事業，在全國敎育事業中，為最發逮之省份。除上海南京兩市外，計有專科以上學校八所，省立中等學校四十一所，省立小學及義務實驗區三十三所，省立社教機關十四所，縣立中等學校六十八所，私立中等學校一百零六所，統計中等學校共計一千餘學級。收容中等學生五萬餘人。各縣縣立小學及初級小學計有八千餘所，共設一萬五千餘　級，收容小學生七十五萬餘人。（以上數字係二十五年度約計義務學級尙不在內）。二十六年度省教育預算總數為六百四十餘萬元，縣敎費預算總數為一千一百二十餘萬元，事業之盛，堪稱獨步。自抗戰軍興，蘇省淪為戰區，戰事範圍初猶在淞滬一隅，繼展至大江南北，蘇省各敎育機關或遭空襲，或遭焚燬，損失之鉅，難以數計。而我國抗戰實力，與抗戰建國精神，則與日俱增，蘇北各縣在軍政當局艱苦奮鬥之下，仍保有完整機構，蘇省教育事業，在此一年中，雖屢經變化，幸未中斷，烽火彌漫，猶得聞絃歌之聲，此皆蘇省敎育界同仁共同努力堅苦奮鬥之結果也。茲特就最近之江蘇之敎育情形分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）省敎育行政機構之變更，敎廳內部組織，原為祕書室，督學室，編審室，第一科，（管理高等及中等敎育）第二科，（管理地方教育行政及初等敎育）第三科，（管理社會敎育）第四科，（管理敎育經費）另設敎育經費委員會中學師範教師檢定委員會，小學敎員檢定委員會，義務敎育委員會，強迫識字育委員會等，分掌各項工作。至廿七年春，省府暫遷淮陰，本廳內部組織略為縮小，旣為祕書室，第一科，（管理教育經費事宜，第二科（管理地方敎育行政及初等教育事宜）第三科，（管理中等敎育事宜），嗣又將第三科合併於第二科，最近組織則為祕書室，第一科，（管理敎育經費）第二科，（管理敎育事業）督學室），編審室，另設駐滬辦事處，就近處理該省遷滬復課各校一切事宜。</p>
<p>（二）縣敎育行政機關之變更，二十六年度以前，本省各縣敎育局，以教費多寡為標準，共分五級，局內組織分為總務，學校敎育，社會教育三股，在二十七年上學期敎廳訂定江蘇省各縣敎，局科裁併辦法，規定各縣敎費實收數在八萬元以上，全縣教育事業大半能照舊維持者，教育局得繼續存在，歸併局內事務並縮减職員暨行政費，局內事務由總務敎育兩股分掌。各縣敎費在八萬元以下，敎育事業多半停頓者，原設各局暫併縣政府第一科辦理，至淪陷區域敎育行政組織，摧毀無餘。</p>
<p>二十七年下半年，敎育廳為恢復淪陷區敎育事業，特將淪陷各縣教育行政機構，重行建立，於各行政區分設敎育督導員，負視察考核輔導督促各該區敎育之責。於各縣設置縣督學，（必要時仍得設置敎育局科）隨同縣政府辦公，秉承縣長辦理全縣敎育事宜。縣以下之各事區，不另設教育委員，由各自治區區長負計劃推行督導敎育之責，區內已設有縣立小學者，縣政府得令校長兼任敎委職務，担任區內教育輔導事宜，</p>
<p>（三）敎育行政方面之措施，年來蘇省敎育行政方面重要之措施，約有左列各點，（一）訂定『江蘇省戰時敎育緊急處置辦法』及『江蘇省立各敎育機關戰時保管辦法」蘇省淪為戰區，對於各級教育機關，應預為有計劃之處置，故訂定該兩種辦法，對於一切敎育事業予以適當之處置，而本省各省立敎育機關巳入停頓狀態者，一律派員保管。（二）舉辦畢業會考，于二十七年八月，分區舉行高初中師範及鄉師畢業會考于漣水，泗陽，東台，興化，四　舉行高初中畢業會考，淮陰，泰縣，溧陽三區舉行畢業師範會玫，淮安區舉行鄉師畢業會考。（三）訂定編級試騐辦法，訂本省各縣縣中及私立初中收容戰時停頓各中等學校初中學生編　級試驗辦法，及各臨時中學校編級試騐辨法，以調整初中，高中師範及鄉師之學級。（四）登記中學校敎職員，對於各中等學校敎職員，辦理登記，向省中及縣中各校分別介紹，以資救濟。（五）派員督察省縣敎育機關，嚴格考核其工作成績，推進省縣敎育事業。</p>
<p>為推行抗戰建國敎育起見，迭令全省各中小學加緊實施戰時敎程，關於中等學校方面，經將部頒之國立中學課程綱要，中等學校特種敎育綱要，及其他戰時中等敎育法規，分發各校參照辦理。關於小學方面、亦將部頒小學特種敎育綱要等戰時初等教育法規多種，分發各小學遵辦，另由廳頒發抗敵時期訓練小學生五種辦法、各縣中小學戰時特種敎育實施辦法等件，通飭各中小學參酌實施，七搜集抗戰建國教材，通令各省立中等學校組織各科敎材研究會，搜集與抗戰建國有關數材，彙報敎育廳，由廳審核分發各校採用。</p>
<h3>世界動向一週間</h3>
<p>— 潘朗</p>
<p>從廿八年五月七日至十三日</p>
<p>五月的第二週，國際形勢又有新的開展，一面是由於英國之拒絕蘇聯保障和平的建議，使德意兩國得以從容佈置新的進攻，簽訂政治軍事條約，正式成立軍事同盟，新的帝國主義戰爭之世界化的危機是更加嚴重起來了。一面則是由於全世界人民之更加認淸目前爭求生存自由的大路，而蘇聯外交獲得新的成就，這種成就雖還只在新的開始之際，但是已經指示出反侵略陣綫更新的光明的前途。</p>
<p>我們的抗日戰爭，續有新的勝利，但是還未脫離苦難之境，而且由於日×之不惜孤主一擲，正在準備其最後一次的投機冒險，而我們各方面的進步與準備又未完全達到應有的程度，因比我們的前途，還可能是更困難更黑暗更危險些！我們必須用更大的力量去粉碎日×和漢奸們一切新的進攻和陰謀，才能保障二十二月以來的苦鬥的成就和爭取抗戰建國的最後勝利。</p>
<p>（一）德意佈置新的進攻</p>
<p>我們在前昨兩週，卽曾明白指出德意等國正在準備在反侵略集廳未曾鞏固擴大之前加以嚴重的打擊，自上週起，德國軍事代表團和外交部首腦卽已　集意國進行密議，到了本週，德意同意繙結軍事同盟的消息終於在全世界報章上驚惶跳躍出來了！這個軍事同盟是德外長　賓特羅甫及意外長　亞諾在米蘭會議的結果，同盟內容雖嚴守秘密，柏林方面則大霄不慚地宣稱：『富予民主國家「包圍政策」以重大打擊』，（海通社八日柏林電）。羅馬方面更稱：「意大利决定簽署德意軍事同盟之後，富足促成德意日之軍事同盟，倘蘇聯與英法重開談判並聲明願意加入英法蘇軍事同盟，則德意將接納東京建議，簽訂三國軍事同盟（美聯社八日羅馬電）。至於日本，雖無明白表示，因而大大地迷惑了英美資本家統治者中間的少數頑固份子，英外長還買於八日與日大使重光共同檢討英日關係：但事實上則已乘機對英法美各國作進一步的威脅，而日陸相板垣並曾明白表示『日本未嘗不可與德意締結軍事同盟，以促成三國防共公約之根深蒂固』而拓相小磯則表示『德意必須與日本充分合作』。（均見路透社八日東京電）。侵略國家這種軍事同盟，所謂「防共」云云旣屬一片謊話，其實際力量亦屬渺茫，主要的只是對於英法的恫嚇，和新的進攻步驟的部署。現在德意兩國正乘英國親　立場尙未確定之際，積極準備軍事，據十日柏林電，德國為實施　軍，正在廣大強徵各業雇員，全國零售商店八千家因之停業，又德國　空部長戈林則已由意國轉担西班牙，　晤法朗哥，準備新的侵略陰謀。而十一日羅馬　則稱意衆院亦於十日通過海軍新預算，同時，一面在阿爾巴尼與希臘邊　建築侵略根據地，一面又增兵里　亞，進諜菲洲的的英　殖民地了。此外德國向北歐的活動雖暫吿失敗，（北歐小國挪威，瑞典，丹麥及芬蘭於九日聲明拒絕德國提供的不侵犯協定）但其陰謀則未稍懈，對於波瀾的威脅，形勢尤為嚴。重</p>
<p>在大戰危機日趨嚴重與　大的今日，蘇聯和平外交的新的成功，便　墨暗裏的火炬一　引起全世界和平正義人士的追從，而其熱誠的反侵略的號召，獲得更廣大的人羣的響應。</p>
<p>蘇聯新任外交人民委員長於六日通吿就職以後，接着就是一連申的外交上勝利的消息，而全蘇聯民衆，紅陸海軍則為此稱勝利而示威，首先是經過外交副委長波丹金的努力，獲得了士耳其，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，波蘭等國對蘇合作的基礎，第一蘇聯土耳其兩國於六日同時發表公報，『成立一致目標』增進相互關係，維護集體安全，各項問題几與共同利益有關者，並當密切接觸，隨時交換情報，』（哈瓦斯社六日土京電）巴黎方面還盛　蘇土談話內容，此中東各國聯防問題為主，今後蘇聯與士耳其，伊拉克，伊朗，呵富汗各國友善關係當更密切，第二，蘇聯與羅馬尼亞　波蘭的外交關係的益趨好轉，尤其是經過波丹金在羅波兩國進行談話以後，駐羅公使和駐波大使先後委定，僅羅波兩國反侵略情形與準備大為緊張，而波羅的海沿岸各國屈辱忍退讓的暮氣亦將為之一掃。其次，是正向英保證，蘇聯和平外交政策，絕未有絲毫變更，並明白忠吿英法。『蘇聯以往及現在，其一員的主張是，倘英法果要東歐洲造成堤防，以阻止侵略，應以英法蘇為基幹，來互利原則，簽訂協約，造成聯合戰綫，以保障可能敵侵略的國家。</p>
<p>【美聯社十一日莫斯科電】而侵略者與無知妄人所倡『蘇聯外交轉向孤立政策，』『德國改變對蘇政策』等等藉以破壞英蘇合作談判的謠言謬論，亦先後為各種事實所粉碎，英國政府則亦表示欣慰，表示對蘇亦所提合作原則，概予維持，因而英蘇談判，雖經一時形成疆局，現在又有開展之勢。此外是法國方面，對於英政府之實際上拒絕蘇聯健議，表示異常失望，變特別向蘇方表示。一九三五年締結的法蘇互助協定當繼續有效。美國方面，亦熱烈歡迎蘇聯之以駐美代辦烏　斯基　格駐美大使，而現美蘇關係值友善台作。</p>
<p>（三）英法首揆作獅子吼</p>
<p>一切偽善的怯懦的所謂不干涉的妥協屈服的政策，已經受到　淸的事實的淸算，而到了宣佈完全破產的時候了！英國法國在歐洲的以至在全世界的地位。巳經到了不得不重新估價的悲慘的時候了！英法兩國廣大民衆和有遠大識見的人士甚至多數政府要員也都警覺起來，為保衛祖國反抗侵略而呼喊而門爭了！在英國，當德國繼宣佈廢止　英海約德波協定而又成立德　軍事同盟的消息傳到之後，全國與論情嘆然，各報鄭重指出歐局新的危機，一致高呼，『吾等需要蘇聯』，督促政府立刻明瞭拆散軸心國家之希望已被打破，今後當更努力實現英法蘇同盟（海通社八日倫敦電）。英格蘭各地勞工亦於七日起舉行示威　動，反對英政府愚人的政策。工黨自由載領袖亦參加舉行演說，痛詆一切偽　的妥協的政策，呼籲援助各小國以圖自保，呼籲締結英法蘇三國同盟。（同上電）此外如路易喬治並大聲警吿英人，勿以日人聲明不顧歐洲事件而引以為慰，指出日事如長矛，針對英國，英國今日必須立卽加强聯蘇援制日的步驟，始能挽救危機，（見哈瓦斯社八日倫敦電）在法國，羣衆情緒同　高漲，社會　定期本日廿七至卅日舉行全國代表大會。黨魁勃魯　及　翼領袖齊隆斯基等均主推行强硬的不妥協的外交政策，要聯合决心保衛自由的各國民族、組織反法西斯集團，他們已準備反法西斯侵略的提案，為本國的獨立興自由而奮鬥，為保衛社會主義與和平而奮鬥。（見哈瓦斯社八日巴黎電）在這種環境中間，英法政府不能不有所警覺了！一週來事　上表現的，第一是英王夫婦之於三日啓程聘問加拿大和美國。朝野一致熱烈歡迎，美國亦已準備盛大迎迓，對於英美加邦交當有相當助益。第二是英法土政府，業已商妥締結互助協定，內容包括地中海，巴爾幹及凡與土耳其利益有關之領域上成立相互防守協定。第三是法國政府之聲明法蘇協定繼續有效。第四是英蘇合作談判的繼續進行。第五是英雜兩國商約業於十一日簽訂成立。第六是英國之亟謀加强遠東防衛力量，十一日路透社倫敦電訊已傳出英駐還東海軍長官參謀將在新加坡開會，商議戰時東西兩方協同作戰的計劃。最後是英首相張伯倫於十一日發表了被認為『獅子吼』的演詞，警吿德國勿侵犯但澤，否則英國不能袖手旁觀。法總理達拉第亦於同日重申法國堅决立場，對任何侵略準備抵抗，並希望蘇聯參加互相援助。事勢脅迫之下，英法政府將不能不走上反法西斯侵略的統一戰綫了吧！</p>
<p>（四）日本××乘機騷動</p>
<p>當歐洲形勢日益緊急之際，在侵　軍事上受到重大創傷的東方侵略者日本××，自然會乘機騷動起來，以　解決其目前的困難，進而企圖實現獨霸亞東的夢想，但其主要的策略，還不出欺誘和威脅兩途。而其主要對象是英法美三國，尤其是英國。</p>
<p>他第一步還是欺國和誘惑，當德意商妥建立軍事同盟的消息傳出之際，他居然默不作聲，還非正式的表示日本不要參加德意軍事同盟，並且惡意謠傳李維諾夫辭職後聯外交政策改變，惡意謠傳德蘇接近，將使日　轉取與民主國家親善的政策，一面還若有其事地擴大反共宣得，表示他侵略中國的軍事，到底只是為了反共。這種欺騙誘惑的表演，雖曾一時打動了民主國家資本家執政者中少數頑固份子的『看心』，但牠的狐尾與利刃究竟還是無法掩藏，八日英國衆議院會議時，路易喬治便大聲指出：『日本之前進，恍如長矛。針對英國　地邊界，溯自平沼內閣成立以來，日本軍隊向印度方面推進，已有二百英里！』</p>
<p>而且，日×的威脅尤可驚人，第一是為奪取英美法各國在華租界，一面加緊向上海租界威脅，首於本月三日通牒英美大使要求　底改組公共租界行政組織，繼而擴大鼓吹日政府進行收管租界；本月七日又压迫租界取缔抗自組織及出版物，逮捕抗日記者；九日又派便衣隊　入租界綁架華人五名，指為抗日份子。一面又於廈門淪陷後一週年的第二天，（本月十二日）　口漢奸　立與被擊斃，竟又在　浪　登陸，轟炸亞細亞油　進一步威脅英美各國。我們知道中日戰事爆發以來，英美法各國在華　益及我國少數從搶砲下逃避出來的民埃資本，多數集於×軍未到的租界及租借地，這次日×之威脅英美之意存劫奪是很明顯的。第二，是繼續在華中華南各不設防的大城市，實行狂炸，其用意不僅為對教國民衆，而且是要澈底摧毀英美法各友邦在華的經濟活動。此而不足，×軍部機關報「國民新聞］還於十一日着論恐嚇英駐華大使寇爾氏的個人安全。我們從這裏首須認消。日×這種騷動是有計劃的，目的厥在破壞我國堅持抗戰的國際助力和澈底打擊英美法各友邦的在華權益與經濟活動，如果英美當局仍舊放任上海租界當局那種忍辱屈服的對策，則前日為天津，昨日今日為上海興鼓浪嶼，明日後日將不祇於香港相印度了，十日路透社東京通訊一，便已揭露日×劃赤道以北屬地管轄，協助僑民進行　謀活動的加緊南進的計劃。『日日新聞』更主張增設一總督，專　菲律賓，荷屬東印度及新加坡日僑事務，以為南進計劃聲援。</p>
<p>（五）汪精衛等活動加劇</p>
<p>上述日本××這種新的騷動，一面在打擊英美法各國在遠東權益，爭取大量的殘酷壓榨與××的地位，一面則打擊我們堅持抗戰的友邦助力。日×除了從國際上企圖削弱我們的抗戰力量進而企圖壓迫我降服以外，他們還繼續利用汪精衛進行以華制華以華　華的國策，首先是以『反共，和平』運動來破壞我們的抗日民族統一戰綫，離間國共兩黨國內各民族和人民興政府間的親密合作。據本港立　駐滬特派員專電報吿。汪精衛最近確曾赴日，而於本月十日返滬，同到的有影佐今五等。當晚傳逆筱庵設盛大宴會代汪接風。據開汪此行與日×直接洽商結果，東京方面對汪日前與日代表在滬所商條件大致均已批准，故汪趕返與其黨徒進行一切。至於所謂在滬與日方所商條件，大致是（一）宣布國事聽　主持；（二）宣佈與日停戰：（三）不請英法德意仲裁；（四）蔣下野、黨交汪，軍交×××，政交××。（五）承認維新臨時兩偽府為地方政府、不加排斥、再與各方協議建立偽中央政權；（六）與日訂立防共協定、經擠協定、聘日技　顧問，日在內地有商租　，承認偽滿等。又據本港珠江日報十二日上海專電，則稱汪係於四月廿七日赴東京，而於五月三日　返，在日與日政府協商組織偽中先聯邦政府，汪曾要求日政府每日供給三千萬為為中央經費。汪×今後陰謀活動的眞實內容雖未確知，但汪在目前陰謀活動繼續與加劇　巳可證實。我們早曾說過：「當汪精衛的和平運動失敗之時，牠只有。公開的去做××了」。這種行為之違反　華全民族的利益和違反中華全國人民的公意，已無待指斥，其未來命運之不能强於王克敏梁鴻志温宗堯之輩，也是大家所可望見的事了。我們覺得特別要喚起大家注意的是，本月七日本港各報發表的中央社三日昆明電所公佈的滇主席龍雲氏致汪精衛一函，這封信，可以看到注精衛直到最近，還在秘密向我政府內軍政委員肆行蠱惑，還在秘密向我抗日統一戰綫內部進行種種陰謀：因世我們今日不僅要加緊動員全國民衆堅决反對汪精衛那種公開的××行動，反對那種公開進行中的組繼偽中央政　的活動，還特別要請全國官民抉高政治警惕性，我們謹以最大的熱誠與崇高的敬禮，希望所有正在受汪　動的人，都能學習龍雲主席的忠勇大義的行為，至少如要「不為一時氣憤所役使，而自陷於荊棘！』同時我們　决要求迅予汪××等以嚴　的制裁，對一切反共和平等違反抗戰建國的言論行動加以更澈底淸掃，我們堅决要求統一戰線之更加鞏固與擴大。民主政治精神與民眾生活改善之有更適要的發展於更切當的實施，以根本阻塞×××××　　活動之路！</p>
<p>（六）抗日戰爭一週形勢</p>
<p>最後，我們報吿　近一週的抗戰形勢。首先，在日×方面，準備了快半年的新的進攻，直到目前還沒有任何成功。相反的是日本國內危機的嚴重與在華軍事力量的退化。卽從這一星期的電訊來看，第一，日本國內的窘急更厲害了：（一）五月九日報載路透社東京通訊，農相櫻內自稱『日本農村，皆有人力不足之感。因為壯丁多　征發攻華，各地農民又紛　軍火廠等作工，農業生產瀕於絕望。同時原料缺乏，各業多有陷於停頓者』！（二）反戰情緒的激漲，珠江日報十二日上海電稱。×國反戰情緒日高，治安不穩，故决於十五日召開司法會議，討論取締違反經濟統制各項之份子以及共產份子等等，而朝鮮，台　之司法長官亦將參加」！（三），快訊社八日東京電。（五月九日上海譯報）『過去數日中，東京　視　在市內大舉搜捕政友曾非國會議員之會員，至目前止已捕二百餘人，將控以搗亂治　　」第二，關於侵華日軍戰鬥力的衰退，觀於最近我軍反攻之進展，巳可明　。同時，×軍內部騷亂和　軍反報的消息、是比以前更加成為日常事件了！但這並不是說日×已　喪失其實行新的進攻的餘威、相反的、日×還逕在　力誇張這種　　，以　　其軍力，如最近一週之繼續狂炸　中華南各城市，卽其一例。而據美聯社九日東京賺，日本官方於九日宣稱，為　『結束對華戰爭』，　將日本之總動員法案，立卽全部　　，同時統一日本陸海之指揮』由此可見日×即將準備其可　的，然而更瘋狂更殘酷的最後一注了！至於我們，為着阻止日×新的進攻，發動了各綫反攻以來，時時苦戰，處處報捷，振作人心，並且　　了國際的重視，去週內就有英國貴衆兩院　員　　　威爾等卅二人致電蔣委員長致敬，並對我國全體抗戰軍民為爭取民族自由而流血獲勝，表示欽賀，最近一週內各路前線，仍有重要的，報傳來：北戰場上。晉南我軍分攻浮山翼城新絳　喜　縣安　。×軍死亡七千以上，晉東一帶，殺×二千左右，連日晉西北靜　一帶，　×約在萬人以上。第八路軍賀龍部三千餘，並於五日克晉祠，現已進　太原。山東方面津浦與膠濟沿線反攻亦甚得手，並曾一度攻入德州，及襲攻煙台，繼海綫上開封　附近和徐州四周。仍有激戰，又據快　社七日重慶電，副委長馮玉詳將軍五日自南陽飛　州，召　將領會議，指示隴海綫反攻，並派大批精銳由洛開隴海前方。東戰場上，江蘇浙江安徽，連日亦均有捷報。五路軍廖磊部並於六日晚攻入安慶，巷戰至八日，×軍受創甚重。據十二日上海電，顧祝同將軍　加强東綫反攻　力，决調十萬勁旅挺進江南游　區，並委專員兼指揮八昌負　。華南南戰場，我軍包圍廣州的形勢續有進展，而遊擊隊混入粵市與粵市內人民合作抗×，近日亦有所成就，如進襲台灣銀行等卽是。江會方面　繼　激戰，於十一日　度收復新會，擊破了×軍向南進犯的計劃。白崇禧將軍自出巡南戰場，並召集　政官染會與訓話，對今後抗戰當有重要指示。最後成為本週內戰事中心的鄂南贛北，我軍亦曾獲得勝利，如再度　入南昌，如收　咸寗奉新進逼通城，便×軍進犯長沙株州的計劃遭受重大打擊。而×軍宣傳『句圍華軍二十餘師』的　樊以東的戰事實際上則為我軍依據優利形勢而進行支解　中之×，縱使×軍今後有進一步的冒險，亦必將遭更大打擊無疑。</p>
<p>總結一週戰况，我們可以說還是站在優利方面的！不過要切實打擊×軍新的的進攻，則不僅首應增强　關到潮　的戰鬥力，增強　　湘邊境和南路西江前綫的戰鬥力，並且要加緊擴大東戰場北戰場×軍後方的戰鬥，而所有這些又那有賴於政治上的進步，國共合作鞏固，肅奸運動的澈底，　以保陣民衆總動員的順利實現。</p>
<h3>加緊生產，堅持抗戰　（續）</h3>
<p>— 李富春</p>
<p>五　生產運動和準備工作</p>
<p>關於準備工作，首先我們要抓住時機。一年之計在於春，春到人間，機不可失！要『不遄農時』在春耕以前我們必須完成一切準備工作。那末，我們要準備一些什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，調查土地——政府與黨委應發通知，限期完成調查工作；在　安矣堡及其他各縣限半月調查淸楚；延安附近周圍二十里限五天以內調查淸楚。調查工作完畢以後我們就可以適當的調劑土地與調劑勞動力了。</p>
<p>第二，耕牛，種子，肥料昀準備——關於耕牛。種子、肥料的準備，一方面各部門自已　法解决一部分；同時由財政廳有計劃的購買大批拼牛和整批種子分發到各部門，從各方面進行，一定能够迅速的完成我們的準備工作。</p>
<p>第三，農業生產工具的準備——除各機關自己　决一部分外，應有計劉分別地區派專人到邊區以外各縣去購買一大批農具。這樣如果還不能解决問題的話，應該馬上收集一些廢　，要求總工會動員打鐵，製造大批農具。</p>
<p>第四，人才的準備，現在應從各方面物色農業專門人才，及有經驗的　　，以備進行生產工作時得到很好的指導。</p>
<p>華五，動員工作的完成，在各地鄉村的民衆中及機關學校部隊中要立卽召集生產運動動員大會、進行充分的解釋動員工作，以新的精神來迎接新的任務。</p>
<p>六　領導生產運動的組織</p>
<p>正確的方針與具體的計劃决定以後，組織工作决定一切！怎　保證我們空前的偉大的生產計劃的完成　？這就需要我們有一個強有力的組織領導工作，經常的解决問題，督促和檢查工作，才能够保證生產任務之完成。不然的話。所謂「偉大的計劃」只不通是一紙空又而已。數十萬石糧食，是不會從天上掉下來的。</p>
<p>第一，建立生產運動委員會——大的部門成立總的生產運動委員會。（如中央機關成立一個總的生產委員會直屬於中央秘書處）每個部門及每個伙食單位也成立那一部門或單位本身的生產委員會，受總生產委員會的領導，各個單位的生產委員會應具體分工，應該有：專門管理組織勞動與分配勞動的幹事：專門管理經濟和生產工具的幹事：專門督促檢查工作的幹事，黨的系統，每個支部設立生產幹事，保證生產工作之順利進行，總的及各部們各單位的生產委員會建立後，應積極的進行工作</p>
<p>第二，生產委員會的具體工作。</p>
<p>一，開展生產運動的動員工作</p>
<p>二，開展生產運動的敎育工作；使每一個參加生產運動的成員從政治上了解生產運動的重要；從技術上了解怎樣進行生產的方法。</p>
<p>三，勞動力的組織與調劑：把勞動力好好的組織起來：在進行生產中，疲勞現象是不能避免的，我們要調劑勞動力不但要經常進行加油打氣的工作，而且要使疲勞者得到適當的安息。</p>
<p>四。建立檢查工作制度。</p>
<p>五，建立獎勵制度，獎勵模範的與生產成績好的同志。</p>
<p>六，研究工作的進行：因為生產運動是空前的，我們的領導機關生產運動委員會應該不斷的研究任生產踐中得到的經驗敎訓，作為今後改進工作開展工作的基礎。</p>
<p>七，把研究所得的結果，在全邊區所有的出版物——報紙，雜誌，聽報上發表出來，指導我們的生產運動，交換經騐，推動運動的前進，使之飛踢向前進展。</p>
<p>同志們！我們每一個同志，在認中央的　召下，怎樣完成我們的任務呢？</p>
<p>我們要拿頑强性和戰鬥性去克服一切困難；為　成中央給我們的艱鉅的偉大的任務而鬥爭！我們相信在今年春耕秋牧的總結中，　利一定是我們的！</p>

<p>【民革晉西通訊稿】×人除了武力的進攻之外，同時幷　的還有經濟的政治的與文化的諸種　　與陰謀、而比較嚴重的也就是配合着軍事活動的經濟侵略。用盡所有的封鎖，摧殘與掠奪的方式，企圖削弱我經濟結構以補　她經濟上的困難、現代的戰爭、就是動員人力、物力、財力的總决賽。長期戰爭中，沒人力的條件不發生問題，則最後勝利是取决于財力，物力的持久內程度如　的。同時我們在抗戰建國的國策中，後方的國防經濟建設，已經打下强固的基礎，充實了抗戰必勝的條件。不過我們認為不够的是：全國朝野，目力都集中一隅，只注意到西南國防根據地　調查，開發，忽略了建國的全面性，忽略了淪為戰區的大部肥沃的國土，在幾道鐵道和內河航綫之　的土地上，政權是我們的，軍隊是我們的，雖然這些×後方的抗×根据地是被×人包圍着，幷旦隨時揮會受到攻擊，在如此萬難的情勢下。仍須顧到根据地的經濟建設，這是談何容易，可是我們不能因困難，就放棄了艱鉅的任務，蔣委員長早給我們指示：「×人封鎖我經濟，便是我們經濟復與的機會」。所以本文先要提出，經濟建設在×後方　据地　的必要與可能，幷報吿一個已經苦幹了半年，而卓著成績的晉東南抗×根据地的建設情形，是如何充實了游擊隊的新的任務，衛護着人民生命財產，　　農村的經濟建股，立下民族工業復興的基礎，幷且再吿訴後方同胞，建國幷不　等到將×子打出　綠江之外的第二天方開始，更不是退到西南的一隅去建國就成。</p>
<p>二、×後經濟建設之必要</p>
<p>申，鞏固抗×根據地的經濟結構，直接供應軍隊需求</p>
<p>×對我經濟進攻政策，是封鎖我　需品與必需品的來路：並以粗製濫造的劣貨消　品及日　品，利用奸商，傾銷各地，吸收我法幣，並混入偽鈔與偽造法幣，擾我金融幣制；其次，便是我們平時听輸出的大宗原料品：如皮毛，生絲，棉，麻，花生，烟　等等。此時屯積　吿變不出錢來，甚至不得不假手好商，將一部原料品貶價　到×手。而且各抗×根據地與後方的運輸聯絡，已經，或將要斷絕軍需民用的供給，都要發生困難；也就是支持待久抗戰上發生了困難。解决這些困難的有力的對策，就是開展抗×根据地的經建設。儘先與辦中小規模的最急需的生產事業，就地收用積屯下的原料，維持根据地內軍需民用的自　自足，突破×人在經濟上的控制，培養出更大的反攻力量。</p>
<p>乙。增加戰時生產解决難民問題　×人經過的地方，都增加了一批難民，到今日造成的數目，据估計已不下五千萬至六千萬。這是抗戰的一個大問題，雖然中央曾經　了百萬元的鉅欵，派員到戰區散放，可是戰區太廣大了，難民也太多了，除了一時的急眼之外，根本的辦法，邊是　收他們參加部隊與從事生產，指定堆區墾荒，增加食糧，及　他們到兵工廠與軍需品製造　里去，到運輸隊，洗衣隊裏去。</p>
<p>丙，發展農村經濟組織，促進政治組織，對于文化水準低落與封建意識　厚的農民，尤其是農村婦女進行民運工作，要組織武裝他們，比　是很困難的。如果我們通過民衆團體，運用着生產組織，吸收他們的小股　本，招　們到工廠裏做工，使他們在經濟上，工作上發生關係，這樣就很容易的促進了敎育訓練他們的工作。</p>
<p>在初期戰爭中，幾段交通綫與幾個大城市，很快的淪於×手，一部份商人，仍留×區，一部份地方士紳以為有錢在鄉間活動不開，也設法投資到×區或匯寄國外，有的更携着大批資財，走到各大城市或租界裏，還有一大部份困在×區在×人工廠中做工的工人，這些逃　要收囘來。這些淪為×用的人力，要爭取過來：它的重要性是不次於瓦解×人，摧毀偽組織，爭取偽軍反正一　工作的辦　也就是創立起生產事業、將淪于×區的人力與財力爭取過來、使他們在經濟上結合起來、再不能股離開鄉土。</p>
<p>三、其困難與其可能</p>
<p>在×後方抗×根据地內從事經濟建設，困難是很多的，可能性也是有的，配合在軍隊的保衛，政府的　助與民衆動員之下，是可能做　合理的生產統制，運輸統　與消費統制的。而且更可能普遍　立起農村生產單位，建立起大數量的有關軍需民用的小工業——　型機器工業，茲分條論之：</p>
<p>甲·增產食糧　×後的抗×根據地，一個一個的建立鞏固起來了，愈是進步，愈是遭到××的忌視，尤其是在止面戰鬥進到相持的階段，×人已經在圍兵圍攻各個抗×根據地了。用盡最殘酷的破壞性的進攻，並且每每選擇了春耕秋收的時候，使你種不上什麽，也收不到什麽。同時，我們駐有大部軍隊的地方，因為應付戰局，軍隊找伕子，要牲口，也自不免妨碍農村，可是在有準備的抗×根據地，除了動員所有的人力，很快的將×人打　去之外，已經發動了農民，多種少用人工的組織，及　收季節稍具伸縮性的食糧，如包谷，高粱，蕎麥　麥（秋種小麥）等，尤其在×人可能進攻的路綫附近，幷且在山地裏，更廣泛地進行着開荒與造林，在平地上很從容的興　了農田水利，像晉冀察邊區，就在阜平開了三道短渠，在唐縣開了一道，每一道渠　可灌溉五六傾士地，晉西北晉西的沿汾河的地方，也開過九道短渠，此外在×區內較豐富的地方，也　行着統制食糧，敎育着民衆對×封鎖將通剩的食糧費給游擊隊，很少的邊區的地方，內為地方貧苦，交通不便，駐軍　多，而應到供給軍糧的困難。不過這些大軍駐紮的地方，哪能與後方相　絡，而有賴于後方的補給。　（以下轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>×後經濟建設之可能　（接第三版）</h3>
<p>乙，創辦小規模生產事業在農村里創辦各部門的生產事業，因無機器，資本及技術人材的缺乏，與乎原料，消費，交通的限制，所以可能的只是小資本小　業，事實上連小工業也是×人進攻的員標，而不得不將廠址選擇在原料不集中，運輸困難的偏僻的地方或山地里，或者在近×區的平地上，採取着分散生產，集中管理的制度來，性質上多是官營或官私合辦，及少數私廠的也應歸政府監督。</p>
<p>初次招股，是比較困難，在戰時投資生產事業，都會感覺到是一種冒險，要經過軍隊保衛住根據地到相當穩當的程度，政府頒布下新工廠法保證股東紅利，幷通過民家救亡團體的解釋說服，自會運富農也慢慢的　躍起來。</p>
<p>小型機器與手工業工具，多半借助着地方上舊有的，與從淪陷城市中帶出來的一部分，都感覺到不够，除了盡力塡造與改良外，是有待于後方的設法補給的。</p>
<p>因為工人和技術人員的缺少，工人的待遇比士兵高，技術人材與專門家的薪水也　行政長官高出兩三倍，除了就地訓練工徒之外。希望在後方工作的技術人員與專門家，能分一部份到×後方去。</p>
<p>丙，軍事需品，日用品的自紹自足處在　×人包圍中的各個抗×根據地，不免有許多特產運銷不出去，與某些必需品的生產不出，而感到困難。不過這種困難，到　容易克復的，這是因為有　中國農業社會，傳下去的自給自足的制度，雖然已經資本帝國主義的控制而破壞，仍是很容易的恢復起來。平原上的產　區，在去年巳大半改種了雜糧，幷且有的地區，又恢復了幾十年前藍靛的種植，隨着取府的指示，巳經很自然的走上生產統制的道路一，至于軍火製造的各種　源如煤　硫硝的出產，又是大部份包括在根据地的山嶺地方，有的根据地如晉東南的存　，估計足供四年的供用，而且由各根据地的邊沿上，所破壞來的鉍軌，更是最好的原料。還有食鹽問　，似乎也比較嚴重，其實呢，老百姓也都有他們的辦法，內跑是靠着岩鹽，井鹽與　鹽，沿海各省則仰仗着長　　，靑鹽與淮鹽，及地方上所出的硝　，鹽場淪于×手之後，隨着卽發動了搶鹽的工作，在人民中間，是早已鍛鍊出來　販私鹽的本領的，如今更得着政府的鼓勵，與軍隊的幫助，成績上比校可觀，最近還要聲明的是，×人的封鎖綫，幷不是銅墻鐵壁，很多地段是可以目由走來走去的，而且，我們也不　束手被圍困着。</p>
<p>四，半年來晉東南的經濟建設</p>
<p>普東南抗×根據地是包括了正太路以南同蒲路以東，山西省轄的二十五縣，在那邊有着優良的地勢，最能打仗的軍隊，比　開　的政府，與民衆救亡團體廣泛的發展，軍政民化合的力量的偉大，于去年三月間，粉碎×人九路圍攻之後，×人再不敢正視這個根據地，雖然他無時不在找機會再向晉東南圍攻，根據地也準備着再迎擊×人的進攻，幷且為了更鞏固史能堅强持久，于去年九月間開始了根据地的經濟建設。關于經濟建設之必要與可能，前面已經論到。記者在此將建設的成績概括的報吿一下：</p>
<p>在山西有三個人口稠密的地區：一為太原盆地，一為晉西南三角地帶，第三個就數到長治晉　一帶。畏治，畏子，屯留，襄垣，　　，敉縣，卽包括在一盆地內，人口稠密，物產豐富，為一最理想根据地。晉城，長治所出產之煤　，與晉北口泉，晋東陽泉，鼎足而三，存鐵足四年之用，長治屯留所出　之小米，一年豐收，足三年之用，他如　酒，　均為名產，長治縣城人口現在三萬以上，為華北在我手的第一大城，亦卽華北軍事政治文化之中心，其所以成就如此，除了其他泉因外經濟的持久。亦為主因。經濟建設的各方面除了造　墾荒，食料之不發生問題之外，最重要的還是各工業部門的建立：</p>
<p>一，軍工業小規模兵工廠幾乎每縣一個；製造量頗能足用，他如紡織廠，縫紉　，軍鞋廠，皮革　，造紙廠總數不下二百，麻子正在改良，俾能兩個印刷，集縣　巳改良紡織機，每天出布六七十匹。</p>
<p>二，日用品的自給生產合作社，消費合作社，產消合作社，工賑作業廠，均甚普遍，而產　合作社差不多名縣，各村均已建立，村產銷合作社資本多在五百元以上，區　銷　作社資本在二千　以上，縣產銷合作社資本在六千元以上，長治，長子，晉城的縣產銷合作社，資卒均達一萬元一上，這些資本多集自農民，政府補助少數。此外更由罰欽及沒牧漢奸財產，各縣區或村均設借貸所　，縣借貸所的基金，均在六千元以上，長治，晉城，高平，陽　各縣借貸所基金目在萬化以上，由民衆救亡團體担保，低利或無利的借予貧農或小本商人，獎勵　隣區　運所缺少的必需品，如購棉及槍　食鹽等。此外如運輸統制，生產統制，封鎖出口，增加稅收，抵　　　，排除偽鈔，均有相當成績。</p>
<p>以上各種措置，均在突飛猛進中，故僅能略舉概括，詳細數目字的統計，尙得不到。縱然得到也未便公然發表，不過我們把從事經濟建設的工人數目里，來明瞭一下，晉　南二十五　的人口　數是三百萬稍强，目下的工人數目，巳不下二十萬　光只參加　人救國會的會員巳達七十萬，再把他們的家屬（已分別參加了的婦救兒救）併算在內，佔在總人口的比例數，當是很可觀的。</p>

<h3>英羅商約內容　購買軍火問題　尙待詳加討論</h3>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>紀念母親節！</h3>
<p>今天，五月第二個星期日，是早經各國規定了的母親節！</p>
<p>在這法西斯侵略者的戰火燃燒了或威脅了整個中國與世界的今天，我們紀念母親節是有特別重大的意義的！</p>
<p>我們誰沒有母親呢？我們誰沒有享受過偉大的母愛呢？</p>
<p>我們的母親，為了偉大的愛，都曾忍受盡人間無數的辛苦！直到可怕的縐紋爬上她們的額上手上，她們依然為着兒女的生活和幸福而不畏一切痛苦！</p>
<p>我們今日中國人的母親，為了中國的獨立自由幸福，她們献出了丈夫，兒子。甚至忍受×人和漢奸之不忍想像的凌辱與屠殺！</p>
<p>我們的母親，在今日是正在演着保衛中華民族保衛人類文化的偉大的節目，然而她們相信間還沒有團結，她們也得不到任何同情，安慰與敬禮！想想吧！天下的兒女，中華的兒女，我們不要臉紅慚愧嗎？</p>
<p>迎着今天偉大的母親節，我們從今天起，要重視母親們今日努力的偉大意義！我們不僅要給她們以同情，安慰和收禮，我們還要展開羣衆運動，去慰勞出扯軍人的家屬！去慰問流亡各地的母親們！去敎育與組織廣大的家庭婦女勞動婦女！去推進廣大的中國人的母親們的保育民挨後代的運動！特別重要的是我們還要去拯救在×人漢奸的檢砲，刀斧，繩索與一切恐怖之下，苦于凌辱，　　，飢寒，死亡的，成萬成億的母親！</p>
<p>迎着偉大的母親節，我們還祈望有知　的母親們，和有資本的母親們，多多　點力量！你們要響應中央的國民精神總動員及實施辦法，在家庭中與戚友間，勵行節約、勤勞與衛生早起！再不要有出入舞場酣於煙　娛樂而不顧家務忽視兒女生活的行為！你們要鼓勸丈夫與兒女們緊張嚴肅　潑團結的精神！你們要鼓勵丈夫兒女們担負拯救國家民族的責任！你們要擴大母愛去愛國家民族，去愛護千千萬萬的難民和戰士！你們還要痛惡漢奸們之主張和平反共，因為這是帮助日×滅亡中國的行為！要知國家民族一日不獲獨立自由，則任何家　利益都將一日不能獲得保障！</p>
<p>記得某著名婦女領袖在『中國的婦女與家庭』一文中，曾說：如果中國女子不重奢華，則中國官員决不貪汚，如果中國女子奮發為國，則中國男兒一定能戰　日×（大意如此），我們誠懇祈望中國的母親們想想這幾可話的重大的意義！</p>
<p>我們謹為大時代的中國人的母親們祝福！</p>

<h3>婦女聯席會　突奉命解散　昨開會討論遵命解散　籌得款項捐製短衣褲</h3>
<p>香港中國婦女聯席會籌備會、最近　本港政府令停止組織後、該會為遵守駐在國之法例計、特于前夕七時半假中國婦女會召開會議、討論解散問題、各婦女界代表　到會參加、會場空氣異常緊張、均對停止組織一事表示惜、認為該會宗旨、純為傷兵難民　賑工作、幷無其他含義于其間、各代表討論結果、决卽日將該會解散、同時幷議決將該會日前在皇后戲院敦請中旅劇團演劇所得欵項一千零二十三元、除支　外、連同中國婦女會捐助之一百元、捐與婦女新運會駐港辦事處，代　短衫褲寄贈前方將士云、</p>
<h3>租貴生意淡　新中市攤位　業務多虧蝕　租金較昔高兩倍至五倍　十餘攤檯準備月後停業</h3>
<p>中環　街市開始營業至今、為時未久、惟市中攤　營業、巳呈極度疲弱狀態、每日營業、十九吿虧蝕，且有若干擬檯，經準備停止營業、實行退租者、記者日昨前往調查、復訪負管理責任之市政衛生局主席託特氏、叩詢對于此種情形之意見、茲分　如下</p>
<p>營業才景　虧蝕頗鉅</p>
<p>據市中販商　數之中、則咸有悔于　投　位時、所定粗額太高、且時至現在、攤位尙有一部份未經啟業、而一部份經因虧蝕太甚而停業牛羊肉檯中復有十四張準備兩月後卽行退租、（因規定先交租　兩月）、一菜蔬檯開業三日後、遂吿停業、其中最大之原因、實因租項太品、而日中營業又冷淡異常故不能不犧牲兩月租金、免遷過鉅損失、目前中市攤抬租値、平　計之、較往昔約昂兩倍至五倍左右、此種過度高昂、殊有背乎經濟原則、據月租六八十八元五角之猪檯主人稱、彼之租値雖不過昂、惟每日營業虧折、巳約達六元、而另一租値一百五十元之肉檯、開業四天卽停業、菒檯之營業亦不景、波輩大都歸咎于當局准許隣近街道舖戶之售賣生菓、致打　街市業務，」</p>
<p>特表示　未肯　信</p>
<p>記者又訪衛生局主席託特氏、據稱關于中市營業不景、與夫若干攤檯停業、彼　接得報吿，且此事　在未可信之列、因市例規定、所有攤　、須織上期租兩個月、彼輩經微租項、而竟放棄其享受權利、不做生意、况又例定凡攤檯之　租。必須于預先一月通報、方便手續云、惟按諸去星期二日、市政衛生局舉行會議時、託特主席之報吿書曾云、新市共有租値達卅四萬八千三百十五元六角、該市之全部建築費不過八十萬元、似此昂高之租值、實超出經濟原則之外、其是否影響于市檯營業。或物價提高、現未致證實之、但據記者子調查所得、中市因新張之故、攤檯中人、因不敢抬高物價，且不鮮將物價壓低，以求其業務上之增進與發展云、</p>
<h3>香港的初夏</h3>
<p>— 郁琅</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<p>天氣還凉，可是女人們光着的大腿和臂　，從　紗的疏孔露出來的有背，已經在吿訴若　——夏天來了。</p>
<p>夏天來了，女人們從皮大衣解放出來；薄薄短短的夏裝，把她們身體二部份展露；馬路上充滿鮮體的顏色和輕　活　的氣象來。</p>
<p>百貨公司的窗橱，陳列着淺色　　的外　衣料，白色的手袋，白色，淺灰，淺白的高跟鞋子……一切，一切，都是供應女人們裝點初夏，初夏啊！這是個女人的季節。</p>
<p>當然，男人們對於氣　的感覺，不會遲　得多的，「換季，換季」，白色的「沙斯堅」，淺　色的　　，淡黃色的「彭畢治」……把他們的　絨西裝換過來。</p>
<p>「換季，換季，」原諒我，讓我向你們送一偭備忘錄——</p>
<p>報紙登載，東來××人貨品，尤其是衣料，進口　增；×製的　　，已有大　來貨，開始傾銷，你們「換季」時，應該怎樣　　呢？</p>
<p>第二點是：夏季來臨了，你們忙着「換季」，前線浴血的抗戰健兒們也須要換季：他們要換的不是「沙斯　」，　　、「彭　治」，…真是價值不及一塊錢一套的短衣褲了，捐　短衣　運動正在推行，當　們「換季」時，你們會想到給前　浴血的健兒們換換季？</p>
<p>島國的香港，深　色的海水，黃金色的沙　，在夏季最可愛，現在很多所游泳塲都已經開放了，游泳的季節到了，游泳場一天比一天熱鬧。</p>
<p>眞的，「陰凉水冷』，游　一囘水「，又可以有冰琪琳，西餅，三味治……等洋　心享受，要是避　　避暑，或避暑兼避　的話，你說淺水灣不住，住何　呢？關人們還可以玻　在淺水　頭築起私家的小泳　來呢！</p>
<p>適應游泳季而來的，總統船，皇后船，從外國運來大批一九三九，或一九四〇的游泳衣，花花碌碌，綢的，線的，絲的，羊毛的，露出整個脊背和肚皮的游泳衣，擬滿了百貨公司的</p>
<p>幾年來，　造游泳衣的廠商，專向縮少線紗，增加肉體暴露部份用功，由露大腿而露脊背，露肚皮……一直幹下去，很多人以為會弄到整個露出不用游泳衣；可可是要做生意的廠商不會這樣笨、今年不向「　」一方面用功，却向「色」一方面用功，各種花樣，圖案雜色，金色銀色，都有，價錢當然不會平　，再少的要十多塊錢，講究的要二三十塊，甚至七八十塊錢呢！</p>
<p>今年香港游泳棚必定更熱鬧，穿起五光十色新花游泳衣的姑娘必定更好看；好看，打扮得好看，這是都市女人們的偉大！</p>
<p>初　來了，初夏帶給你們美　，　樂，他也帶給你們一點恐怖，——可怕的夏季流行症劇烈拉也來了，據衛生當局佈吿，巳有多宗發現，今年要及早開始提防。</p>
<p>雪糕、冷飲，將要受限制發　，可是你不用担心沒有雪糕吃，某一家　雪糕公司宣佈去年做了一　十多萬元的生意，去年虎烈拉不是很流行嗎？</p>
<p>虎烈拉，今年自然是個嚴重問題，你看，人口增加了三十多萬，生活程度一天比一天高，窮苦中人還能議衛生麽</p>
<p>或許非是帶着以黑色遮陽眼鏡的可以看淸楚的吧（？）——在陽光裏很多窮苦大衆在山坑　洗操，用手捧著山水來喝，街邊水喉也常有成　的婦人，孩于在喝冷水。</p>
<p>加租迫　的惡氣下，從前住一　樓的，現在改住一房間，住一房間的改住、一床位？住床位的而達街頭。天氣　一點，大街小　兩傍都歷滿人：有男子漢，女人，老太婆，也有吃奶的孩子，　髒的一　　的是溝　邊，吃的是一個鎮板一碗的隔夜餘物。孩子們吃的是在菓攔門前拾得的壞生菓……在這樣的生活下，虎烈拉來臨，他（她）們豈不是在死亡致前線　？</p>
<p>但是，一點不要忽略，虎烈拉是傳染很還的病症，虎烈拉認不得有錢人的窮人們害上虎烈拉，有　人們也會　傳染：為　救自己，有　人也應　　助可憐的窮人們改善生活一下，及早防　。</p>
<p>初夏是　頑皮的孩子，他帶　人們不少美麗的夏裝姑娘，游泳姑娘，也帶給們不少　　　宿街頭者。</p>
<p>他　給人們冰淇淋，游泳，華爾茲舞，……也帶給人們可怕的虎　拉。</p>
<p>為工作而流亡</p>

<p>望各方面　指教督促</p>
<p>這時期我們在每一個紀念日子、策動了紀念會、作為我們的活動的機會、去年的「七七」、「八一三」、「九一八」等紀念日、我們會用神出鬼沒的游擊式的方法、在每一個熱鬧地段娛樂場所、散發傳單標語、得到很大的效果、尤其是「八一三」那天、楊同志為了工作後被××憲兵司令部述捕，遭受了很嚴×的×、領隊沈同志自從到汕頭後、得到××後援會理專周遊先生的同情和綏助、重回到上海工作、并且參加了上海碼頭工會、在三月廿八日上海偽市政府成立紀念日的一天、沈同志奉命發動三千多碼頭工人、宣誓永不與×人合作、情緒非常熱烈、到股近上月二十日因上海市工晨商界宣傳精神總動員，為懸掛國旗發生糾紛的事情、我們有三個同志被捕，並且得到×人方面最後報吿、在勢不得不離開的環境下、我們就拋棄了家庭、偷偷地在忽促的時間裏離開了上海、「過去的工作大槪是這樣、關於現在」、為了走的忽忙、我們貧乏的經濟力量、除去了船票、餘下來的、在香港沒有三天就完了、到現在雖然生活很苦、可是我們只覺得精神方面很愉快、至於以後、我們將囘到祖國帮助軍隊隨軍工作、軍隊需要做的一切工作、我們都願意找來做，或者帮助地方做民運工作、把我軍民打成一片、我們决定去做別人不願做的最苦最難的工作來得到我們無上光榮的代價、我們的報告完了、我們希望大家能够同情我們、援助我們、並希望各方面不容氣的指敎與督、繼由來賓致詞、及該隊答詞畢散會云、</p>

<p>遞呈當局　懇切陳詞</p>
<p>經數次集商、乃决定聘某大狀師、負責向華民司憲及市政衛生當局接洽、請求一方則再行聯名遞呈當局、懇切陳詞，將目前當地居民養　之生活情况、詳細陳明解釋、如遵令遷移往新界　靜區域、繼續豢養豬　牲口、　為處境　極艱辛、蓋當地數千居民之從事　　養牲口、十九無若何巨大資本、而日常一切養畜豬隻牲口之原料、槪親至取給于半島及本港居民樓宇之藉水、及菜欄街中市所　之　　蔬菜苟一旦遷往　市區較遠之新界。則一切糟水爛蔬菜之取給、固極困難、而一切遷移寮舍木屋之建築、又非於向當資財不可、衡諸目前九龍　一帶養戶能力、實無法負担</p>

<h3>羣衆·革命·歷史劇　寫作與上演的問題</h3>
<p>— 胡春冰</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>羣衆劇是以羣衆為主人的戲。古時候的戲劇中的主人是帝王貴族或者半人半神的人物，中古以後，騎士和流浪詩人和被權貴賞識的小家碧玉才上了舞台。理髮師做戲劇的主　竟是現代劇的先驅紀錄，因為那時　產階級才逐　抬頭。用一個有　有血的社會集　，用羣衆做戲劇的主人，是現代　又現代的事。多謝偉大的詩人總爾哈崙，他的「黎明」，把一向無名英雄的士兵，變成了有靈魂的集體，有了共同的意志，將侵略的戰爭變成了光明的戰爭。羅曼羅蘭的「七月十四」是法國革命在舞台上的光榮的史詩。託里卡可夫的一怒吼吧中國」　寫出來一個受難民族的萬衆一心的掙扎。抗戰而後的「保　　　橋」，「黃花崗」更是不願做奴隸的中國人抗戰建國共同意志的表露與吶喊。</p>
<p>希臘劇中，不是沒　羣衆。但是羣衆只有唱歌班的用處，他和主角的唱和裏，歌頌者命運之偉力，有時這羣衆就是命運的代表，陰森森的鬼影一樣。莎士比亞劇中的羣衆，只是隨從和兵士，他們用來做陳設，顯出劇的主人是怎樣的偉大，或是帮忙造成一種圍氣。他們沒有血沒有肉，和剪影一般，在易卜生和魯斯華綏的劇作中，羣衆只盡了歹角（Vllian）的任務，就更不足道了。</p>
<p>羣衆的覺醒是現代的事，羣衆劇的出現更　最現在的事。羣衆劇在中國之有血有肉的演出。則是抗戰開始以後　時代的嘗試。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>革命劇這名詞是為了便利而創造的．舉凡描為一個社會一個時代的生命的行動，都叫做革命劇。革命劇可以說是「戲劇的戲劇」，因為「沒有　爭就沒有戲劇」，而革命是最直接的，最偉大的　爭。還有，不一定寫的爭或戰事的正面，而能適應革命的需求，具有豐富的革命性的，都可以叫做革命劇。</p>
<p>革命劇普通總是有兩方面：一是革命的陣營，一是反動的陣營，而劇的高峯必是個衝突，或者脫是一個搏們。革命者必有一個典型人物——個組織者，或說出指　理論的Raieoneur也有熱情而工作經驗不够的，甚於有內奸。反動陣　當中必然　的角色可以反映出那腐敗，殘暴，而必然成為革命的對象的。此外，反動陣營裏同時革命的人，或竟　革命者潛入裏邊做工作。總之，把一個革命的行　，或革命發出的原因及影響，用一個角度的社會生活把他形象化出來，都可以叫做革命劇。</p>
<p>蘇俄緊跟着，月革命那個時期的煽動劇，中國第一期國民革命當中那些宜傳劇，是第一期的革命劇，到現在，把內容　實了，領域擴大了，藝術水準提高了，理論形象化了的蘇聯的目　的前進劇場，和在創建中的中國抗戰戲劇，是革命戲的成熟階段，在寫作上，克服了口號的淺　的宣傳，克服了打殺主義的方　克服了一切的千篇一律與差不多的毛病，而使革命劇成為最精巧的形象化的意地沃羅基的顯示，使革命劇成為嚴進步的戲劇藝術的造詣，這正是抗戰劇連中劇作者當前最嚴重的任務。</p>
<p>在上演上，革命劇原則都是羣衆劇。對於革命的意識與羣衆行動之有機的統一，對於革命劇中暴露，諷剌，說敎，組織的處理，對於革命劇中人道主義及人情味的煊染，都需要以最大的努力，來克服庸俗的職紫演劇中所夢想不到的困難。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>歷史劇的寫作與上演，是意見最多而難於求得一個最好的結論的題目。大別起來，可以分三種典型：</p>
<p>第一種是表現派的方法。這個名詞並不是指歐洲讀揚速，動，力的被科學冲擊得頭昏的文學家，而說的是我們的民間職業歌劇。這畸形的表現，在粵劇中特別淸楚。丑生可以做任何一個戲裏面的主角，而唐宋元明四朝同堂也不覺得奇怪。「西施」可以情困　子龍，「關雲長一也不妨「大戰尉遲恭」，父親是唐朝的打扮，母親是宋朝，而外祖父不妨是淸朝的。兒子民國初年，女兒則是一九三九年最摩登的Style這一切都不成問題。吳越時候談抗戰，反法西斯，唐宋時候講自由結婚。都不希奇。因為戲總是戲。</p>
<p>第二種是再現派的方法，這可以拿Drintwater的「林肯」和歐美一般的歷史傳記影片作別，他們考據，他們模仿，他們求其一絲一部像，一舉一動都肯古。但是常常產生了毫無生氣的古董，或者織細的逼肯妨害了它的感效。</p>
<p>第三種方法是批判的，就是經過現代人整理的史料，把目前大衆的力與要求參透了壓史的殘骸，用我們熾熱的　强的求生的意志把死屍予以新的生命，在古舊的外衣裏有着活躍的，當今的，戰鬥的靈磯的，這是主動的方式，就是以我們的眼光，對歷史做批判的接受，使形象化的古代成了我們的要求的象徵。這樣我　和所謂表現式的不同，我們的態度要絕對的嚴　，我們的研究工作要大家一起實踐，我們要了解那一個時代的社會，研究　一個事件社會的原因，歷史的意義和目前的影響，我們不能容許任何一個傀儡或衣架走上舞台，我們的歷史的了解，批判的態度，和藝術的演出要打成一片。</p>
<p>同時，我們最大的努力不是用的被動的依照歷史上瑣的繁文縟　，而是在古　形象中喚起大衆認職當前任務的情緒。</p>
<p>特別是在一切服從抗戰，一切服務抗戰的今日，我們的學問修養，工作經騐，物質條件都異　貧乏的今日我們只有這唯一的標準，也就是唯一的方法</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>羣　革命歷史劇的三位一體化，是今日愛好藝術者的一個迫切的課題。使戲劇的領域擴展，爭取大量的文化水準較低的　衆。於高度的　衛中有　Aeitatine的作用，我們非克服種種困難以實　這任務不可。</p>
<p>這將是一個光榮的傳統，一切戲劇工作者要起來做這飾統的創造人！</p>
<h3>中國救亡劇團·準備　第七四二次偉大的演出　本月廿五六七日在利舞臺大規模義演</h3>
<p>— 奇卓</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團，一年多來走遍南北東西，在前綫，在後方，在都市，在農村，公演了七百四十一次：這是我的腿淚，是你的眼淚，亦是人家的眼淚！這是我要說的詁，是你要說的話，亦是大家要說的話！這是我的遭遇。你的遭過，亦是大家的遭遇，這是我的出路，你的出路，亦是大家的出路———這樣的戲劇不知感動了多少同胞，不知多少同胞被鼓舞起來！</p>
<p>在商城，從四面八方來看戲的農民不肯走睡在戲檯下，帶米來燒飯，準備明晚。後晚再看下去。</p>
<p>在一個地方——是徐州——公演了之後，被感動的士兵對『中救』朋友說，你們就是在表演我們，你們舞台上的長官就像我們的長官一模一樣。</p>
<p>又在一個地方，——洛暘——還沒有公演完畢，天沛然下雨畏官命令弟兄們暫囘部隊避雨稍候。可是，弟兄們依依不走，寧願給雨淋了二個多鐘頭來繼續看不去。</p>
<p>再在一個地方，——大別山——看過戲的農民問「中救」朋友說：你們表演的究竟是眞的還是假的？中救朋友將「×人暴行錄」像片給地們看着，害羞的女人掩着眼睛不敢看下去，異口同聲把×××咒駡一頓。——從此他們開展訪問與組織的工作，成為保衛大別山的勁旅。</p>
<p>最近，他們到了韶關，在勞軍的公演中，又不知感動了多少將　與士兵。張發奎將軍在「三·十二」植樹節中。集了全禮士兵，親自指揮全體士兵向「中救」朋友敬體，並殷切訓勉。</p>
<p>……像這一類的事實，眞是說不了，講不完，他們何以有這樣的號召力呢？答案很簡單，該團份子除金山王瑩外，在上海出發的十四位同志及沿途所吸收的伙伴，都是優秀的靑年，有高度的熱情，有正確的政治都識。因為工作之努力，生話之嚴　，博得各方的同情與帮助，自然不是一件偶然的事。</p>
<p>他們將出國宣慰僑胞去，用　　憑實據給僑胞知道過去的出錢出力一點亦不食白費。並將動員僑胞的財力，完成戰地的「傷兵　院』「文化食糧供應處」及「後方工藝所」的偉大任務。——這是迫切的任務，是申救朋友能够完成的任務，亦是我們應該帮忙的任務。</p>
<p>『中救』抵港之後，『歡迎』「聯歡」的高潮汹湧了起來，戲劇呢？却因為他們的　重籌備，還未能和我們見面。「趕快公演吧」！『趕快公演吧』，很多人都是這樣懇切地　待着。</p>
<p>月來，「中救」朋友一面籌備出國手續，一面排演新劇，生活的緊張，工作的努力，還繼續費過去在戰地服務的精神。他們出國的時間，預定在下月初旬；公演呢？亦已經有了端倪了，這是讀者所樂聽的吧！</p>
<p>現在香港谷界賬濟難民聯席會為因崇仰該團過去在國內工作的卓著的成績，和精練的戲劇藝術。為擴大救亡宣傳及籌款賑濟傷兵難民起見，特議决敦請該團於出國前為該會作一次大規模的義演；經已派員徵得該團的同意，同時推舉中國新聞記者公會主待這次的演出，推舉四婦女聯會，華商總會，鐘聲慈善社，中華藝協會等組織義演特委會，專責辦理，已於日昨舉行第一次特委會議，經過了詳細的討論，大要决定：一，公演地點在利舞台。公演時間：本月廿五。廿六，廿七，一連三晚，公演劇目：第一晚演「保衛組國」，第二晚「民族萬　」第二晚「臺兒莊的之春」三，券價分二毫。五毫，一元。二元，三元；五種。</p>
<p>連日以來，他們在利舞台續極排練，凡是參觀過的朋友都贊偑其認眞的熊度。靑年戲劇協會和其他戲劇工作者，被邀請帮助演出配角，已經深深受其感動。這是一個極好的影響。</p>
<p>記者昨天訪問中救諸友，幷到利舞台後台細察他們工作情形，益信三劇的劇情及演出的技術，定有偉大的成功。</p>
<p>尤其篷本港戲劇界空前盛舉的，他們的逼眞　景廳有盡有，偉大絕惀，總共花去港幣二千餘元。該團多才多藝的朋友，正在精心製作中，利舞台後台的幾層樓，現在已經成為工場了。城牆，山坡，石碑，房屋，……眞是　肖極了。幾樹桃花，記者還以為是眞的呢。那偉大　麗的各種屏封，會山先生說：演過之後，布條摺起來，木架分開打成箱子，帶到南洋去很方便。</p>
<p>「雷聲」「風聲」都有特製的器械，一推動就像眞的雷聲，眞的風聲一樣，記者很感興趣地玩了好幾遍，暗自欣　見識見識，要是囘到內地幹戲劇工作；這就是最實用的一課。其他像飛機聲，槍炮聲，亦都有辦法使之逼眞。</p>
<p>燈光呢，花了一干多元有很多機件是從美國購來的，為了利便燈光的控制，舞台上面的鋼網被失　地拆掉了，將來演出，是早晨，是，中午，是黃昏，是夜晚，都可以用燈光襯托出來，佈景及燈光共花去港幣三千多元這是香港見所未見的奇蹟，加之劇情之生動，演員之精練，將來演出元必一鳴驚人。為香港話劇創立一個偉大的新紀錄。同時該團旣義演出　，又掏出了演出費港幣三千多元，這亦是義演之登峯造極者。</p>
<p>該團過去的演出，山地曠野，街頭……就　舞台，為什麼現在一來就如此考究呢，答案很簡單，讓僑胞，讓　際友人了解我們新中國的戲　水華是能够做到這步田織。</p>
<p>中救第七四二次大規模的公演將和香港僑胞見面了，這是他們劃時期的紀錄，亦是香港劇壇劃時期紀錄的，讓我們熱烈地帮助着，推動吧着！</p>
<p>劇運動態</p>
<h3>全港戲劇界國民宣誓　定今晨在普慶舉行</h3>
<p>自中央當局頒行精神　員動國民公約宣誓後，本港僑胞，亦紛紛響應，各大社團舉行國民公約宣誓的日凡數起，參加者統計共達十餘萬人：在這里，我們可以看出僑胞對於祖國的救亡情緒的熱烈，可以看出民族抗戰前途的光明。現在，全港幾百個影劇工作者，又在黃花崗演出委員號召下，定於今日上午九時正在九龍普慶戲院舉行精神總動員國民公約　且誓了，監誓人是中央委員陳策先生，幷請　地山，鐘天心，夏衍諸先生蒞臨演講。參加宣誓的有中國救亡劃團，中華藝術劇團，中國旅行劇團，時　劇團，廣東戲劇協會第一劇團，靑年戲劇協會等四十餘　戲劇團體，宣且誓典禮，已推定由歐陽予情，胡春冰。金山，唐槐秋，鍾啓南，黃凝霖，譯國恥，李化，盧敦等九人組織，並選出梁福和，詹歌奮，黃克山，鐘平，洗鋒，徐國嶼，朱白水，海燕，陳碧怡，區愛，李潔瑩，露露，湯德，鄧竹筠，楊薇，唐若靑等幹事，以梁福和為總榦事。冼鋒，鐘平為副總幹事，負責籌備一切，希望全港的戲劇工作者，都能够踴躍地來參加今天這個神聖的偉大的典禮！</p>
<p>黃花崗將重演　今日在華南總排演</p>
<p>民族革命史劇「黃花崗」的演出，動員了全港三百多個戲劇工作者，和二百餘多歌詠工作者的　加，造成了戲劇界空前的合作，觀衆熱烈，規模的偉大，情緒的緊張，可說是香港劇　劃時代的創舉，但因為種種關係，致觀衆不能普及，是一件憾事！為了更廣大的推廣宜傳和增加收人起見。以低價重演可說是一致的要求。所以經過香港，戲對界黃花崗演出委員會和各界聯會義演特委會的幾度商量就决定本月二十日及二十一日夜，在九龍普慶戲院重演「黃花崗」，再度為賑聯會籌欵　却前綫陣亡將士家屬。同時，本月廿日，正是我們中國戲劇運動的拓荒者歐陽予倩先生的五十壽辰，為了紀念我們底戲劇先進幾十年來在戲劇領域裏强緩的鬥爭。更為了給廣大的後進者以一個沒切的學習，於是在這一次的重演，並作為慶祝歐陽予情先生五十壽辰的義演、同時並組織一「香港戲劇界慶祝歐陽予倩先生五十縣辰義演委員會」，負責今後演出的工作。規在已在香港各界賑聯會聯合舉辦的名義下，積極進行重演「黃花崗」的工作，並定今（十四）日下午一時在華南中學舉行總排演，在一個星期後，我們又可以再面嫵這偉大的民族革命劇的演出了，</p>
<p>華員會戲劇組　今晚公演『凰凰城』</p>
<p>港府事員會。成立迄今。已經有十六年了。他們會務的推進，莫不以求華員的利益為前提，對于祖國的事業、亦響應不遺餘力、現在該會乘在徵求會員未結束前、特定于今（十四）日星期晚下午七時，在華人行八樓該會會所，舉行成立十六週年紀念大會，以聯絡新舊會員的感情，目的由該會游藝部戲劇組表演話劇，『忠孝節義』（卽鳳凰城）及其他節目助慶，這個劇自由中旅劇團在最后戲院公演兩次，全場滿座，向隅者甚多，博得藝增不少的稱許，該會這次的演出，係得本港戲劇界巨子李晨風先生祖任指導幷用粵語演出，屆時相信一定有良好的成績呢、</p>
<p>中國救亡劇團在大別山裏工作的時侯</p>
<h3>七四一次的演出</h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>幕仍閉蓄</p>
<p>台前走出了一個頭上貼着兩塊大黑膏藥，耳旁夾着半節紙烟，脚下夾着一捲紙的小販，觀衆正在注意的時候，小販突然地跳到台下，高舉著手，大聲呼喊着「喂，阿要看看號外，剛剛出版』！「阿要看看東洋人又在閘北開火哉」！「阿要看看中國兵交關利害」！「哎呀，是報販呀』！觀們互相笑着，搶着從報販手裏接到的傳單，一面熱烈地鼓着掌，呼應着。飾報販的演員在場子裏繞了數圈，把印好的標語傳單散完後，便悄悄地從太平門走出來了。</p>
<p>觀衆正在　找報販時，忽然聽到幕後發出一種很大的呼斥聲音，『走，走！』夾着鈍重的皮鞋聲，接着從台側推出幾個男女，樣子　很狼狽，一個官長和四個弟史押着，漢奸們背上都插着一而紙旗，「槍斃漢奸×××」。幾個民衆跟在後面，很狠地指斥着；漢奸們每個人都很痛悔地把受×人利用，受大漢奸唆使的話說出了。『拖卜去槍斃！』官長命令着，兄弟們即時把漢　拖到暮後，民衆跟着下場，官長這時很沉痛地向觀衆演說，內容說到漢奸的可憐和無知，並說良心與精神不可失，至死也應該不忘記是中國的子孫，絕不能為×人張目而損害自己的祖國，最後並特別說到每個中國人都應加緊防止和偵察漢奸工作，如果你們捉到漢奸，「請鄧卽送到司令部去，我在那兒等着！」</p>
<p>幕慢慢地開了。空氣頗為嚴　，白衣的看　正在不停地地碌着，　個小帆布床，躺着各種不同受傷的勇士，他們在呻吟中追述上海戰事，前線的肉　衝鋒，正　得津津有味時，忽然靠近台口的一個傷兵痛哭起來了，他一直沒有說話，這時他在驚愕的勇士前說出他的梅恨，「我被我國家的軍閥騙了，我不該來打你們，來作這種無目的戰鬥的」。從他的話語中，知道他是一個捉到不久的俘虜，「我萬想不到你們待我這樣好，我錯了」！他繼續地慟哭着。這時我們的受傷將士和醫生勸慰他，並對他說明，日本民衆是和中國民衆沒有仇的，這次的戰爭於日本衆沒有好虛，希×××××××××××！」俘虜也舉手高呼着。</p>
<p>在整齊的步伐聲中，開了幕。</p>
<p>拿着長槍的，拿着刀的，拿着　頭的，長衫的，短衫的，一個武器不齊，服裝不齊的隊伍，正在聽　長訓話『兩肩不能挑着田能逃，快跟××幹一朝！」官長把這句口號，反　地說了，並說祇要我們　到底，××是一定可以趕跑的。壯丁們都出神地聽着。訓完了話，升旗號饗了。台上的人立正，台下的人全體　立，偉大莊嚴的國雄緩緩地升去上。</p>
<p>全劇完了。觀衆們以一種無限的好感表示在漫長的掌聲中。</p>
<p>同志們差不多每一幕都上台，這時正預備透一透氣，好好地用井水洗一次臉的的時侯，警報長鳴了起來，全城又沉浸在黑暗中，急急地我們向後院走，今夜又要在冷的防空壕　過夜了。『空中的××們，來吧，中國人民已不是炸彈和屠殺所能嚇倒的了！』</p>

<h3>華南戲劇的一支挺進隊　滄江劇團的生長和門爭</h3>
<p>— 陶·濤·　訊通明高</p>
<p>在偉大的時代偉大的環境中，人篷敎育着戰爭，而戰爭也正在敎育着人，無論那一個部門，要是不能把自己溶化到戰爭中去，就只有被戰爭淘汰，毀滅。所以，廿多個月的抗戰，祖國原野的烽火毀滅了多少怯弱，取巧的文化團體和工作者，同待，也新生和長大了多少英勇沉毅的文化圈　和工作者呀！尤其是戲劇這一部門，在抗戰的烽火中更有了飛躍的表現。我現在我所要報道的滄江劇團，就是這樣的產物。</p>
<p>他們的產生在九一八的沉痛刺激中，高明縣第三區的救亡靑年，感到中華民埃解放運動將必强烈的展，為了配合未來戰爭的需要，他們便積極的提高戰術的要求，滄江劇團就生長起來了起始組織經費是非常短少的，然而在艱苦的掙扎中，也置備了帳幕，汽燈和很多戲劇書籍道具。對于戲劇。每个團員都是沒有什麼修養和技口的。祇　滿腔熱情，便勇敢的參加這新的工作，他們要在現實的生活學習，找尋敎材和經騐，而這个時候，許多批評中，他們聽到了不少「不近人情」的輕視，但篷，這種語氣越聽得多，他們　　精神，越要鬥爭，於是道支新型的熱力的突擊隊，竟在這「不近人情』的　蔑中進步，壯實起來，幷且在戲劇運動史上寫下了光榮的一貢。</p>
<p>鬥爭的歷程一九三九年的春天滄江劇團開始了突擊的生活全體團員二十人，成為小學敎師，學生，和靑年農民混合隊，工作範圍很廣闊，高明，高要，鶴出，新興，他們要把救團的熱情傳邊給上列各地的窮鄉僻壤，去感召觀衆，啓示觀衆，最叫人興奮的，那時候，中國劇運方正萌芽，而這三个多月的工作旅費，是由自己籌備的，那些來自由間的農民團員，在深度困難的環境下，也集到了這一技洪　裏，英勇地奔上征途。那時他們最感束手的，是沒有得到各地上層的聯絡，和動助，而鄉下的　時劇場的佈置也不易動員：然而這些，缺點都幷不足以動搖他們的工作，因為他們有堅忍卓絕的精神，更有為民衆所最喜歡的戲劇，所以無論到什麼地方，都獲到同情，獲得羣衆，比方他們每到一處，住的是祠堂廟宇，這種地方，是被鄉下人認為祇有乞丐，流氓方樓宿的，待到工作開展鄉下人看了他們的戲。受到了感動了，覺得他們睡眠在地上，生活比自己還低劣，更非常的難過：有的十分迅迅的給他們找床板，或者是廚具和道具，也有搶着替他們煮飯挑水的，贈送魚米瓜菜的。在這樣親密的合作下，使他們更看見了　運的前程是燦爛的，便更得奮發，更得苦　。七七事發，他們更密切地配台抗戰的需要，以强韌的姿態工作着；從此，他們不但鼓動民衆，幷且進而組織民衆：高明縣各區的靑婦抗×同志會，農民協會後援會他們用了最大的力量協助其長成的。</p>
<p>偉大的效果在偉大的民埃革命抗戰中，廣大的羣之內，能够眞實的收到敎育作日政治作用的效果的戲劇，才是現階段的新興戲劇，高明縣是滄江劇團的根地，從國家施行兵役制度起，全　的純良質　的農民奮勇起來目動入伍，爭取殺×機會的有四百餘名，這數字，任何一縣比它不上的，這輩壯士都是農戶子弟，不但沒有　避，沒有頂代，而是十分激昂的拿血和肉去桿衛國家；這些無上的光輝，可以說滄江劇團的無數次演出的影響激動，廣州退守後，×兵沿江佛公路進據九江，高要和高明的下游，成為了最前綫，×人的惡性宣傳隨實傾瀉到來，一時民衆誤中這種毒素的很多，前綫七，很多鄉村的抗戰情緒突呈潰亂，甚至有用地方的力量妨碍自己的軍隊，這時，滄江劇團迅速的以强厚的戰力馳赴搶救，集中火力描準靶子掃射，更强烈地發揮着戲劇鬥爭的熱力，目前，該地的民衆能夠密切的和軍隊配合作戰，也就是滄江劇團的戰士們從×人的　流中爭取起來的戰績了。</p>
<p>在鄉邨，鎭集戲演完了，便開始訪問出征軍人家屬。和募集慰勞品。教育他們怎樣去應　戰爭一方毒，淸奸，堅壁消野一因為民衆，看完戲后對他們已有很好的　識，發生感情，遲着這種優勢的戲衛去幹，什麼都會得獲意外的方便，每到一處都組織孩子歌詠隊，敎孩子唱歌，這樣幹，一面使孩子懂得團體的意義作用，一面普及救亡歌曲，一面使用孩子的歌詠編隊，沿街去動員觀衆。</p>
<p>的確事實是如此的不由你否定了：唯有中國的新與戲劇才最易感動中國的民衆，才最易領導中國的民衆，二期抗戰張開開，蔣委員長昭示吾人「……宣傳重于作戰，民衆重于士兵……』像這樣英勇的戲劇工作者在火線上，其對抗戰貢獻的偉大，實不下于壯烈的士兵，那絕對不是强調的話。</p>
<p>組織和經費由於工作經驗的豐富，所以組織也很嚴密和健全，滄江劇團的組織，是一劇團長，兩個團附，以下分總務，交際，文書，庶務，編五股，每設均能奮鬥的發揮其本位任務，競取預期的成績，至於　費的來源，除了捐募之外，又氏有得領政府的資給，有時便　自己負了。在這捶苦頭的境遇內，他們只好努力的節省物力，但是舞台裝置，利用的巧妙都卻有、可思議的工夫、只要化點小費，那麼憑着丰滿的經驗云設計便會獲得很好的果實。因為他們是新劇人，大衆的天才藝術家呢。</p>
<p>缺點與困難認為最缺點的是所在地太深入義村，易不客得到都市文化界的導輔，比方報帋刊物的　得，國際和戰事的轉變知道得遲鈍，甚而中國劇運進度怎樣也不可知，這影響工作的進行很大，還有一件叫他們時刻不能忘懷的，就是未能轉成對更廣大的土地去。至於艱難，照當前最　重的問題，要囑于經費還沒有經常的着落了。今後的計劃，還要擴大組織充實戰力，像增購放影機，收音機，撮影機，和簡單的流　劃團所以必需的科學器械，準備展拓他們的游擊區域，擴大宣傳範圍。但是，這更有意義的伸張是必要更强大的力量的，尤其是經費，為了中國新生劇運的前程，為了民族革會的生死搏鬥，從事戲劇運動的先進團體和　志，是為該給以正確的指導，實際的援掖的。</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>似是而非的和局　旭和杯懸而未決　一比一南華與海軍和　訂期下星期三日再決戰</h3>
<p>【本報專訊】昨天午後、在加山舉行的旭和杯足球决戰、結果演出一個似篷而非的和局、因此錦標問題、縣而未决、且待下星期三日、再來一次鬥爭、才可定奪、而一般看客、亦多結一段球緣、</p>
<p>戰時情形、平淡多、精彩少、南　由開始而至下半時二十分鐘、還以一比零佔先、那在眼驗發亮的銀杯、看將到手了，可是球兒弄人、忽來災禍、海軍得裁判員的帮忙、收復失地、而南華此失、許多人都說寃枉、但裁判員之權高於一切、我不運置一詞、</p>
<p>演出精彩不多的原因、非為別的、乃天氣很熱，球人們精神上受着相當影響所致、</p>
<p>以情勢觀察、南華前鋒線雖表演未能盡致、然亦造成機會不少、本來勝券可操的、獨惜楊水益、葉北華都因遲緩失機、海軍遂於艱難奮鬥中、卒挽囘垂危之局、</p>
<p>照事論事、南華應勝二比零、可是、祇因栽判員判斷的不同、局面乃隨之而異，有一次，水益射進一球，而且很妙、但裁判員指他越位、判作不算，怎知相反的拖盤以頭所頂一球、似未入門已被李天生勾出、却判作入算、差之毫厘、謬之千里、眞是有幸有不幸、事後據天生說、那球千眞萬確是未入門的。</p>
<p>兵艦來去無定、所以海軍球員有不須向總會報名註册便可與競賽的權利，因此、昨戰的陣綫、又有一二位新人出現，中堅谷巴，位置良好、不　出擊、專力於守、所以馮景祥被他釘着不易施展、吻內衙亦穩健、</p>
<p>前　線以岩士杜郎與拖般最活動，新將霜特、切球甚佳、開角球更好、故奪回一球、是他間接之功、</p>
<p>南華前線中、水益無佳作，實不宜强居左翼，來週選員、應仍以羅斗文任此職、削足就履、殊非得計、郭英祺演出亦不像打前銜那麼爽辣、葉　華又甚侵，故而整個前線、常有呼應不週之弊、</p>
<p>後方六員、皆具見工夫、保守要塞、很少破綻，故昨戰未致勝利、非關守者防衛不力、是因攻者進展不兇、若下星期三補賽時，得李惠堂或黎兆榮上陣、再加上中堅梁榮照、攻守增强、勝利自至了、但未知到時改編的陣綫、能符合理想否、</p>
<p>有人說、昨賽足七十分鐘、　未分勝負、又不加時再賽、實有利於南舉、若加時再賽、南　疲兵苦戰、恐不免一敗的、此說我亦云然</p>
<p>初戰時、海軍先取玫勢、岩士杜郎與磨利士、變雙越關進取、隨進抵南華的腹地、天生從旁闖出、一踢出險、由是球在中央、你來我往，互相鏖戰、至六分鐘、慶材演一妙傳、為廣森截得阿斗，及載盤載奔，迂廻越關而進，既至要地切中、球由高空垂下、正購門不遠、此時但見人頭鑽動，身軀互　、但景祥卒以頭頂中此球、斜落門之　方、中柱彈入網內、狄架臣雖欲撲救、但已不及了、南華遂以一比〇佔先、開球再賽、海軍聯竭力進攻、谷巴短傅岩士杜郎、從邊進犯、後傳磨亞士射鬥、　磨頂上不開花、無功而退、戰至十八分鐘時、海軍仍繼續進攻、計拖般及　特、均嘗得機射門、惟以射門欠準、遂終未致果、有頃、南華反攻，廣森景祥先後射門、前者被伙架臣眼明手快接去、後者高越而過</p>
<p>如是厮殺下去、海軍越戰越勇、連迫得角球兩次、圍攻南華球門、幸南華三軍用命，遂挽狂　、迨至二十五分鐘、景祥及英祺經數度之短傳，已衝越海軍的後衛、惜此時因兩人相讓射門，遂為軒地乘間救出、後水益于亂軍中、射進一球、但栽判員暘號楊指越界、雖入不算、不久，上半時終了</p>
<p>下牟時海軍士氣陡盛、眨眼間，　特衝進要地射門、迫得角球、開來恰巧、榮才拳擊之、為岩士杜郎接得。幸岩無的放矢、斜落荒郊</p>
<p>混戰至七分鐘時、景祥北華　雙衝鋒反攻、但為韓尼維路所阻、由是南華漸覺不支、戰至二十分鐘時、更見洞漏、乃卒被　轉從邊高傳一球、為托般頂進、雖天生救出、但裁判員已判作入算了，</p>
<p>旣打成平局、戰情緊張起來、惟水益兩度射鬥、均未建功、而海軍力攻之下、亦無再獲、無何完場，因雙方均不願加　再賽，遂一比一戰和、並定本月十七（星期三）日下午四時半再賽、兩隊陣勢列下、</p>

<h3>昨日棒球聯賽　中華隊反敗為勝　六比八香港會後勁不繼　今日上午先後兩塲舉行</h3>
<p>公開棒球聯賽，昨日下午二時半、中華隊對香港會隊於嘉出海軍球場、</p>
<p>中華新好手胡國棟、鎭守一壘、接球穩健，但擊球尚差、黃榮俊於首次兩局、充當投手、大失常態、首局送出自由壘一次旋又投擲欠準、被　薩，獲加及黎頓等、先後上壘、連負三分、次局黃氏之精神、仍然彷彿、送出自由壘凡三次、再破波迪士打、多拉打、及柯里化跑得三分</p>
<p>第三局始變下列之陣勢、全隊聯絡、漸次恢復、充任右　之區炳南（卽嘉那利）演出佳作，屢接對方飛球、防守牢固，陳芳及林業擊球偷蠱，亦俱有好良表演、為中華取分、乃能以八比六反敗為勝、</p>
<p>統觀中華出賽兩次，防守方面、常有錯誤、進攻方面、亦有弱點、而擊球一道、尤比去年失色，此或練習過少之原故、</p>
<p>香港會搜羅好手多名、陣脚轉强、進攻方面、頗為兇悍、投手羅蘭士、穩打權紮、中規中矩、柯　化，依藝、波迪士打、及製　頓皆是十材，捕手獲嘉、脚步迅速、與去年相比、判若兩人、為擊手四次、皆能上壘、且獲一分、難能可貴也、茲將雙方價人績分列后、</p>

<h3>綱球名手義賽　演出很平淡　觀客亦寥無幾</h3>
<p>昨天下午四時、在香港木球會舉行的網幾義賽。所得門票教項是全數撥給英　會香港分會的、未開賽前、一元五角和一元兩種座位的看客幷不事、一般人以為開賽後會廖起來的、那知事實不然，開賽後、看客依然是寥寥無幾，門票收入成績，相信不甚可觀、</p>
<p>參加表演的名手共四組、本港雙打冠軍亞軍和最强勁的兩組、通通依時出場、而又出人意料之外的、各個的演出、都沒有精采可言、也許他們幷非故意如此、不過表現出來的、實在有點太隨便了、</p>
<p>全港雙打冠軍的徐氏兄弟、贏了兩林珍之後、却以二比六之數、給籍籟無名的新搭當德孚、高爾文組壓倒、最後一盤、林珍兄弟對德孚，高爾文、德高兩人却又給林氏兄弟殺得片甲不留、比數為六比一、昨天五盤演出、林珍兄弟成績最好、除輸給徐家兄弟之外、兩盤全以六比一之數、打退何李組和德高組、不過對徐氏之戰、屈居下風、未免遺憾、</p>
<p>第一盤　何家　李汝榮組和德孚高爾文組交鋒、德高組先施下馬威、連卜五局、想不到竟會在這生死關頭奮起，連下七局、反敗為勝、　德高組—七比五—何李組</p>
<p>第二盤　徐氏兄弟對林珍兄弟、徐潤培、首先發球、連輸兩局、接着扳囘第三第五兩局、第六局輸了之後、第七局徐氏兄弟抖　精神、得囘一局、跟着打成平手、一口氣冉取兩局、以六比四獲勝、</p>
<p>徐氏組—六比四—林珍組</p>
<p>第三盤　徐氏兄弟對德孚高路文組、徐氏兄第先施下馬威、獲得一局、接，連　五局、至第七局才有點兒生氣、但是大勢已去、卒以二比六之數敗陣、這一盤、徐氏兄弟精神渙飲、錯誤百出、另一方面、德高兩將認定大敵當前、雖說是友誼賽、萬一獲勝、也可算是光榮不過的事、所以始終實力、卒得　利、</p>
<p>德高組—六比二—徐氏組</p>
<p>第四盤　林珍兄弟對何家李汝榮　　仇人相見，份　眼明，林家將以前吃通向李的苦　、這囘也就格外小心，用　練的手段，使何李兩人的堅軔戰略，完組沒有施展的機會，故何李　僅獲一局便敗下陣來、</p>
<p>林珍組…六廿一…何李組</p>
<p>第五盤　林珍兄弟戰德半高　又趙，雨林珍戰至　何　組的餘威、長驅而下。以六比一之比數星勝、全是全港綱球呼義賽、便平淡地結束了、</p>
<p>林珍組—六比一—德高祖</p>
<h3>籃球義賽　中華壓倒梅芳　青年會克星隊</h3>
<p>靑年會為籌募隨軍服務團經費，昨晚舉行男女籃球義賽、首場女子中華對梅芳、雙方均　以全軍出征，戰來未見有劇烈之爭奪、中華乃混合成軍、聯絡殊欠合拍、僅有個別枝術之演出、李紳瑜、　夢貞攻勢頗强、劉守光姿勢則妙、射籃欠準，後衛饒慧貞頗盡職守、何崔等則未見出色、梅芳葉美蓮未出、但盧　嫻、明攻暗襲、迭有佳作、陳月梅黃寶珍二人，射籃亦頗具妙手、至後衛則無咎無譽、故而兩隊實力、各有千秋勝負亦無極大之　　、第一節為九比七、第二節為十七比十二、中華一路佔先，易籃後、梅芳於力攻之下，以廿二比廿二挽成平手、至第三節完則以十四比廿二反勝、第四節爭奪漸烈、雙方再度以卅一平分春色，直至場終、中華卒以卅六比卅三獲勝、</p>
<p>次場男子靑年會對星隊、前者為星島南華鐘聲混合隊、後者為東方隊變身，另加入培英之丘棉變鐘聲之郭植鴻，雙方旣以此為表演性質、勝負不用重視，故戰來均能避免粗魯之動作、同時眞正之技術，得因之演出、全賽中，以陳汝正最佳、彼與劉德禹不迭有會意合作、餘如粱國驛、李沛炎，　傑民等、亦見精彩、星隊馮念華射監轉身、均能　免對方保衛之抵抗博得彩聲不少，餘子亦盡職守、郭丘兩人，因與該隊未慣合拍，時有誤會、</p>
<p>比賽過程、靑年會先後以十一比七、廿一比九佔先、十半場吿終、仍以七八八比十九勝，易籃後，靑年會攻整頓弱、旣以卅三比卅三被迫平手、再以卅三比卅五落後、嗣後星隊一路風順，以四十一比卅八及四十比四十六佔優勢，直至最後六秒鐘、星隊仍以四十九比四十八、勝、迨至陳汝正得球乘勢而射，球剛入籃、完場之笛長嗚、靑年會遂以五十比四十九獲勝、</p>

<h3>向南華足球部進一言</h3>
<p>— 會員一份子</p>
<p>本港人士　震體育、由來數十年、而推行最普、者、厥為足球、吾會——南華——對於是、提倡不遺餘力、人材輩出、成績昭著、派隊參與各項競賽、恆獲錦標為已有，其聲譽之隆、迄今弗衰、然積仞為山、固非豐　豐夕裁培之功、其得力於歷屆主事者之　為設施、次及各球員之意勉競存、然後築此巍然共仰之地位。實非偉致者也、</p>
<p>因是之故、吾會足球部騙員推舉得人舞否，其有開於部務進行、至偶切要、以余所知，近十餘年來，該部職員、必推舉深悉內情及與令體球員素有感情聯緊、面又精明能幹者任之、舊吾會各部、事務最繁劇者為足球、辦理最煩難者又為足球、若主事者能力不逮、治理弗周、則　務千頭萬輪、决不易　劃如意也、</p>
<p>是屆該部新職員已舉出皆明速有為。熱心會務之士、付以、審，誰曰不宜、惟聽諸會友口中。尚間有閒言者、蓋謂新職員固多於才能於事、膚此職責，或可勝任愉快、獨是事集厥躬、非僅多才多能者、便可統籌兼顧，無虞隕越，誠以未深悉該部內情，猶莫知辦事任責之艱巨、因其中之盤根錯節，在　多有、主事者非駕　就熟，殊不易應付俗如、今委此重任於新職員身上、其運籌帷幄、內外應酬、能否不負會衆之期望，尚有待於事實證明、刻猶未可卜也云云、</p>
<p>吾向視會事如已事、對　職員期望甚殷，謹祝就任之後，展其新猷、以慰會衆、先哲有言曰、「業難守成亦不易」、今新隊員之　任。非祇守成而已也况社會事業、非係個人而屬於大衆者、如其將來治理不　體、則較不如先作退一步忠之為愈也、余　情而意深、望新職員好自為之、</p>

<h3>安眠藥</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>我尚未動身之前、接到余老師的信，叫我到林大夫那裏買一瓶安跟華，從郵局寄去。余老師好久不見了，聽說他在游　區很活躍，身任要職。怎麼要起安眠藥來？因此我特地繞這到他鎭上登門拜訪，直接把這藥片送給他。</p>
<p>徐老師比從前更瘦了，精神却煥發。他見是我，連連拱手，哦哦哦的讓我進去，在抱經閣裏坐定。女　捧茶上來，我就掏出藥缾來，雙手呈上，問起他為什麼要這安眠藥，他把玩着那　上的裝璜，輕輕笑着說：『我失眠呵！』</p>
<p>意外一個小小的院于，靠壁一　綠竹，底下幾塊假山，我想起從前執經問字的時候，會在這裏前消膚了不少歲月，東奔西定，一事無成，徐老師固老些，我也生長了　鬚，他問起孤島的生活，慨歎地說：『上海到底不是首陽山，薇亦只是袋裏的錢，錢完了，就是給人擠下來。』</p>
<p>我就是給擠下來的人，聽了徐老師的話，心上說不出的難過。徐老師接着說：</p>
<p>「我在前綫危急，故鄉吃　的時候，曾經處分家事，立下遺囑，誓與鄉國共存亡，叫林大夫給我　來一瓶安眠藥，我自己寫上八句，叫：一士不可辱，心不可死。讀聖賢書，所為何事！成仁取義，仰樂於此，天地神　，實式還之！」這件事朋友們全知道的，我下了决心履行要言，　得城裏國軍一退，就抓過瓶來，一傾而下。不料睡了半夜，些微睡意亦沒有，只聽得老妻　笑的盤昔，我心知出了外意，這玩笑可眞開不小，敎人　我欺世盜名，如何得了。我　起來，向墻上一頭撞去，彙了、然而並不曾死，等到　來，大家全圍住了我，勸的勸，說的說，我一聲不響，呆呆躺着，兒子說得較有理，他說，『沿江沿海城市的淪陷，是早就料到了的，不能和亡　相比，文文山單孤忠耿耿，到了無可挽囘，　以一死報國。現在抗戰開始，萬不能和亡國相比。』他們守住了我，簡直沒有死法，後來兒子去內地參加抗戰，臨行向我跪着，請將他的出征，換取我的不死，這時候，我自己就眞不想死，想睜開眼看着大軍反攻過來把强盜起了出去的情景，嘆了一口氣，那些悠悠之口，怪我不死，只好不管了，肖翁就笑我是：「千古艱難惟一死。傷心豈獨息夫人」咳！</p>
<p>『心雖未死，辱却忍了，我們期待着的反攻，總不來，這暴躁眞是說不上來，左亦不是，右亦不是，望望日影，聽聽聲音，度日如年，坐立不安，等着等着，我的神輕　了常熊，往往失眠　客枯槁，胃納不佳，眞恐要憔悴而死了。放翁詩：「王師北定中原日，家祭無忘吿乃翁，」將為我而作了。老妻拿出安眠藥來，很有效。這眞可笑，地不曾殺我於當死之時，却又救我於偷生之日！</p>
<p>「現在我又變了。我　得無論什麼事，自己做二不覺時間慢，袖了手等人，那　心慮！與其守着等反攻，何若自己也來幹！自己認為在當時已經死去，現在更生了。自已减去了四十歲，正當少壯，正好為國出力，毛弟！我現在不比你長，或者還比你年輕，我學會了開槍，也會收發無綫電。我們已把這裏的侵略者趕走了，這兒現在是一片乾凈土。我現在很開心，精神上年輕了不少。不過晚上還是時時　不着，非　藥不可。』</p>
<p>我聽着他說，時時舉起手，抹額上的汗，一聲不　的坐響。</p>
<p>他留我生了二天，我走的時候，他親自送到輪給碼頭上，拉住我的手，丁寗說：</p>
<p>「你做不成夷齊，囘去探望過雙親。還是囘到這兒來，一定，我等你！」</p>
<p>他那過度興奮的臉，瘦稱使入放不下心，我暗地祝禱這藥片能　永遠維持着他！</p>
<h3>滿洲的雪</h3>
<p>— 舒羣</p>
<p>他知這，比他們知道得更淸楚些，可是他呆着，好像在說：</p>
<p>「那又有什麼辦法呢？」</p>
<p>她　他換完　帶的時候，他說：</p>
<p>『謝謝你！』</p>
<p>『不用你謝！誰甩你謝！關于壹切邸是假的！』</p>
<p>『那我騙過你嗎？』</p>
<p>『你想呢？』</p>
<p>『我　我沒有！』</p>
<p>「沒有？你昨天的詁，今天就忘了嗎？你昨天說我是你們的一個同志　可是——可是今天就趕我囘家！你說你不是　子嗎？』</p>
<p>「　——」他表示了解了　現有的心情，然後他說：『要你回家也非說你不是我們的同志啦，你囘家。你當然還是我們的同志！』</p>
<p>「那你們不回家，偏要我一個人囘家呢？』</p>
<p>『你聽我吿訴你，你囘家的理由——』</p>
<p>不聽，哭着跑囘她的房間去，　着那屋內的桌椅，都代她響起氣慣的堅　「。她咕嚕着，似乎在說些什麼：</p>
<p>『……父親……你做了漢漢奸……你有了錢……何必再要　見……你是愛錢的……何必再愛女兒……女兒不要你這樣的父親……』</p>
<p>她撲在床上，好像她來時抱住電竿一樣，不肯　開一步；她認為這暫居的房間，便是長久的臥室，她不聽任何人的勸慰；別人對她的好言，祗有惹她反感，她懷着一個過於主觀的想頭：</p>
<p>「我不定，看你們能把我怎樣！」</p>
<p>她的來，是那樣意外的難的：她的去，又是這樣意外的不易的。</p>
<p>雨文安慰她，甚至驅逐她，這完全無效，他的　感到工作意外之果了。</p>
<p>幾乎過延半點鐘了。別的同志，都捆好了自己的行囊，祇在等待她去；去後，他們立刻向另一個秘密的佳址遷移。如果久了，發生了意外：那麼，他們便不止三十萬元的損失；他們的頭，是無限價值的。　（六五）</p>
<h3>無恥的文風　（展卷有益錄）</h3>
<p>— 窮夫</p>
<p>為侵略者頌捐功　，其　並不是容易的事，因為往往連自己也　越說越個　。但是，我們一向的文人却有一種很好的本領。就是不瞥有沒有破綻，不管對不對勁，只給他一個棒，棒。　。而事實上那些捧的話都只有一套，實在也沒有辦法可以　到有沒有注綻和對不對勁。證明這種「文風」的歷史上的材料應該很多。不過我暫時找到的知是「平宋錄」。</p>
<p>「平中錄」記元戰永相巴延平定爾宋的經過，是一部典型的拍馬著作甲種綠報紙作　劉　中，是被稱為能文的人的。前面做序文的部　，方囘，杜道堅，周明　位，一大概也　於「文辭」上很不　，不　好在我並不想勢定他們底　世，所以也不用多說，但麼該特別提出的是：他們都是漢人，把他們看作六百多年前的「××報」派的作家，是一點也不寃在的、</p>
<p>劉錡底序上說：「我聖元大丞相巴延公，取襲淮如拾芥，平江南猶反手也，」又說，「吾聖天子以仁義將將，淮安王以仁義將兵，　食壺漿，室家相慶。」</p>
<p>方囘底序上說，「：不以一兵一騎入城，不據一民，不掠一物，所至皆然。</p>
<p>杜道　底序上說：「！用兵江漢，不嗜殺　。城下之日，萬姓謐然。」</p>
<p>周明底序上說「復提師取江淮數十州，直　　秀，所向風靡，兵不血刃…」</p>
<p>這都說得很好聽，但一讀本書，却又發見了許多相反的記載，眞呌人覺得本　奇了：</p>
<p>癸丑訪且，遣人陽暹堡往諭宋之將士，宣布朝廷威德，宋將不降，夏貴且以戰艦千餘艘列於大江之下，　截江面，其勢堂堂，若不可近，甲寅，又遺人數陳禍福於宋將，宋將答曰，「我輩累受大宋重恩，正當戰力，死圖報　，此　時也，安有叛逆歸降之理？備吾甲兵决之，今日我來之天下天下，財傳孤注，驗贏在比一挪耳。」承相遂指揮諸將進攻　　堡竟日不克。…</p>
<p>宋兵大潰於江中，陽　　人心瓦解，宋兵數十萬衆，死傷者幾盡，流已蔽江而下。</p>
<p>丁已，亟相率兵至於丁家洲。…已未，丞相指揮諸將，授以方路，夾於江岸樹砲弩等具，併力攻之—追殺數十餘里，江面流屍，水為之赤。！</p>
<p>壬午，至常洲，前進之兵相持不决，…亟相召諸將指授方略，令各備攻具，期於來日分道攻擊，又先置人大呼喊下；城中不聽，癸未，又令諸樣吏畫論文射入城中，又不聽，承相　督帳前軍數千臨於南城，又多建火砲及弓弩等具，日夜攻之不息。申已刻…克之，遂屠期城。</p>
<p>原來「如拾芥」和「猶反手」，總是這里「不降」那里「不聽」，這里「竟日不克」，那里「日夜攻之不息」，而所謂「不嗜殺戮」，「兵不血刃」，總是這里」流　薇江而下」，那里「水為之赤」，而「城下之日，萬姓謐然」，總是「屠城」，這樣的情形，軍隊會文雅得沒有一個　號衣的「老組」和一匹馬跑進城裏，也不捉一名百姓，不搶一點東西，而民衆也會熱鬧再備茶飯，家家互相道喜，眞是古怪之至了，</p>
<p>那麼，難道做序的人就簡直沒有細讀一下本書嗎？那又不是的。就是細讀了，也還得這樣為。那理由，便是上面說過的，因為捧的話只有這麼一套的緣故，作家到這時候其實也是可憐得很，算是自己用釘子把自己釘死了。</p>
<p>然而還有一個問題；本書既以拍馬為主　，作者劉敏中何妨就為大丞相不動一兵，不交一戰，便平定了南宋，豈不更乾脆得　了嗎？但是也不成，但為那樣一來，不但完全改了史實，會使人根本不相信你底賬，而且還會使書中的主人沒有了「功動」；也沒有了「威武」。所以作家到這時也是可憐得很，一樣是用釘子訂死了目己。</p>
<p>然而此其所以為無恥的文風歟！</p>

<h3>Post-War Education in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Ma Fangyuan</p>
<p>In the past, the educational endeavors of Jiangsu Province were the most developed in the entire country. Apart from the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, there were eight colleges and universities, forty-one provincial secondary schools, thirty-three provincial elementary schools and compulsory education experimental zones, fourteen provincial social education institutions, sixty-eight county secondary schools, and one hundred and six private secondary schools. In total, there were over one thousand secondary school classes, accommodating over fifty thousand secondary school students. Each county had over eight thousand county-run elementary schools and junior elementary schools, with over fifteen thousand classes in total, accommodating over seven hundred and fifty thousand elementary school students. (The above figures are approximate for the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, not including compulsory education classes.) In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, the total provincial education budget was over six million four hundred thousand yuan, and the total county education budget was over eleven million two hundred thousand yuan. The prosperity of the endeavor was unparalleled. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Jiangsu Province has become a war zone. At first, the scope of the war was limited to the corner of Songhu, but it later expanded to both sides of the Yangtze River. Educational institutions in Jiangsu Province were either raided by air or burned down, resulting in incalculable losses. However, China's strength in the War of Resistance and the spirit of national reconstruction in the War of Resistance have been increasing day by day. Under the arduous struggle of the military and political authorities in various counties in northern Jiangsu, complete institutions have been maintained. Although the educational endeavors of Jiangsu Province have undergone many changes this year, fortunately, they have not been interrupted. Even amidst the raging flames of war, the sound of learning can still be heard. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of colleagues in the Jiangsu Province education sector. Now, the recent educational situation in Jiangsu is described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Changes in the Provincial Education Administrative Organization: The internal organization of the Department of Education originally consisted of the Secretariat, the Inspectorate, the Compilation and Review Office, the First Section (managing higher and secondary education), the Second Section (managing local education administration and primary education), the Third Section (managing social education), and the Fourth Section (managing education funding). In addition, there were the Education Funding Committee, the Secondary School Teacher Certification Committee, the Elementary School Teacher Certification Committee, the Compulsory Education Committee, and the Compulsory Literacy Education Committee, each responsible for various tasks. In the spring of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the provincial government temporarily moved to Huaiyin, and the internal organization of the Department was slightly reduced, consisting of the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding matters), the Second Section (managing local education administration and primary education matters), and the Third Section (managing secondary education matters). Later, the Third Section was merged into the Second Section. The most recent organization consists of the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing education endeavors), the Inspectorate, the Compilation and Review Office, and a Shanghai Office to handle all matters related to the resumption of classes by schools in the province that have relocated to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Changes in County Education Administrative Organs: Before the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, the education bureaus in various counties of the province were divided into five levels based on the amount of education funding. The internal organization of each bureau was divided into three sections: General Affairs, School Education, and Social Education. In the first semester of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Department of Education formulated the "Methods for Consolidating and Reducing the Departments and Sections of the Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province," stipulating that education bureaus in counties where the actual revenue of education funding was more than 80,000 yuan and the county's education endeavors could mostly be maintained as before could continue to exist. The internal affairs of the bureau were consolidated, and the staff and administrative expenses were reduced, with the internal affairs of the bureau being managed by the General Affairs and Education Sections. In counties where education funding was less than 80,000 yuan and most of the education endeavors were suspended, the original bureaus were temporarily merged into the First Section of the county government. As for the education administrative organization in the occupied areas, it was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In the second half of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Department of Education, in order to restore education endeavors in the occupied areas, re-established the education administrative organization in the occupied counties, and set up education supervisors in each administrative region, responsible for inspecting, assessing, guiding, and urging education in their respective regions. County inspectors were set up in each county (education bureaus and sections could still be set up when necessary), working with the county government and handling all education matters in the county under the leadership of the county magistrate. In each district below the county level, no separate education committees were set up. The head of each autonomous region was responsible for planning, promoting, supervising, and guiding education. In districts where county-run elementary schools had already been established, the county government could order the principals to concurrently serve as education committee members, undertaking education guidance in the district.</p>
<p>(3) Measures in Education Administration: In recent years, the important measures in education administration in Jiangsu Province have included the following points: (1) The "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education in Jiangsu Province" and the "Wartime Custody Measures for Various Provincial Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province" were formulated. As Jiangsu Province became a war zone, planned measures should be taken in advance for education institutions at all levels. Therefore, these two measures were formulated to provide appropriate measures for all education endeavors, and personnel were assigned to take custody of all provincial education institutions in the province that had entered a state of suspension. (2) Graduation Examinations were held. In August of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, graduation examinations for senior and junior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools were held in different regions in Lianshui, Siyang, Dongtai, and Xinghua, with senior and junior high school graduation examinations held in four areas, normal school graduation examinations held in Huaiyin, Taixian, and Liyang, and rural normal school graduation examinations held in the Huaian area. (3) Measures for grade placement examinations were formulated. The "Measures for Grade Placement Examinations for Junior High School Students from Various Wartime Suspended Secondary Schools in County Secondary Schools and Private Junior High Schools in Various Counties of the Province" and the "Measures for Grade Placement Examinations for Various Temporary Secondary Schools" were formulated to adjust the grades of junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools. (4) Registration of Secondary School Faculty and Staff: Registration was carried out for faculty and staff in various secondary schools, and they were introduced to provincial and county secondary schools to provide relief. (5) Personnel were sent to supervise provincial and county education institutions, strictly assess their work performance, and promote education endeavors in the province and counties.</p>
<p>In order to promote War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Education, orders were repeatedly issued to all primary and secondary schools in the province to step up the implementation of wartime curricula. Regarding secondary schools, the "National Secondary School Curriculum Outline" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the "Special Education Outline for Secondary Schools," and other wartime secondary education laws and regulations were distributed to various schools for reference. Regarding primary schools, the "Special Education Outline for Primary Schools" and other wartime primary education laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education were also distributed to various primary schools for compliance. In addition, the Department issued five measures for training primary school students during the period of resistance against the enemy and measures for the implementation of special wartime education in primary and secondary schools in various counties, and circulated them to various primary and secondary schools for reference and implementation. Seven, Collect Teaching Materials for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction: Orders were issued to all provincial secondary schools to organize subject teaching material research associations, collect teaching materials related to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, report them to the Department of Education, and the Department of Education reviewed and distributed them to various schools for adoption.</p>
<h3>World Trends of the Week</h3>
<p>— Pan Lang</p>
<p>From May 7th to 13th, 1928</p>
<p>In the second week of May, the international situation has seen new developments. On one hand, Britain's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal for guaranteeing peace has allowed Germany and Italy to calmly arrange a new offensive, sign political and military treaties, and formally establish a military alliance. The crisis of the globalization of a new imperialist war is becoming even more serious. On the other hand, people all over the world are more clearly recognizing the main path to seeking survival and freedom, and Soviet diplomacy is achieving new successes. Although these achievements are only at the beginning, they already indicate a new and bright future for the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Our War of Resistance against Japan continues to have new victories, but has not yet escaped from suffering. Moreover, due to the Japanese ××'s reckless gamble, they are preparing for their last adventurous speculation. However, the progress and preparation on our side have not fully reached the necessary level. Therefore, our future may be more difficult, darker, and more dangerous! We must use greater strength to crush all new offensives and conspiracies of the Japanese ×× and traitors in order to guarantee the achievements of the bitter struggle since 22 months ago and strive for the final victory of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>(1) Germany and Italy Prepare New Offensive</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, we have clearly pointed out that countries such as Germany and Italy are preparing to launch a serious blow before the anti-aggression collective front has been consolidated and expanded. Since last week, the German military delegation and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been gathering in Italy for secret talks. This week, the news of Germany and Italy agreeing to form a military alliance finally jumped out in alarm in newspapers all over the world! This military alliance is the result of the Milan meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Although the content of the alliance is kept strictly secret, Berlin shamelessly declared: "It has dealt a major blow to the 'encirclement policy' of democratic countries" (Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 8th). Rome even claimed: "After Italy decides to sign the German-Italian military alliance, it will promote the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. If the Soviet Union reopens negotiations with Britain and France and declares its willingness to join the British-French-Soviet military alliance, Germany and Italy will accept Tokyo's proposal and sign a tripartite military alliance (Associated Press, Rome, 8th)." As for Japan, although there is no clear expression, it has greatly confused the few stubborn elements among the British and American capitalist rulers. The British Foreign Secretary even re-examined British-Japanese relations with the Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu on the 8th. But in fact, it has taken the opportunity to further threaten Britain, France, and the United States. Japanese Army Minister Itagaki has clearly stated that "Japan may as well conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy to promote the deep-rootedness of the Anti-Comintern Pact." Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso said that "Germany and Italy must fully cooperate with Japan." (Both seen in Reuters, Tokyo, 8th). This kind of military alliance of aggressor countries, the so-called "anti-communism" is all lies, and its actual power is also slim. The main thing is to intimidate Britain and France and deploy new offensive steps. Now that Germany and Italy are taking advantage of Britain's pro-German position that has not yet been determined, they are actively preparing for military action. According to a Berlin dispatch on the 10th, in order to implement ×× military, Germany is extensively conscripting employees in various industries, and 8,000 retail stores across the country have closed down as a result. In addition, German ×× Air Minister Goering has transferred from Italy to Spain to meet with Franco to prepare for new aggressive conspiracies. An 11th Rome ×× claimed that the Italian House of Representatives also passed a new naval budget on the 10th. At the same time, while building aggressive bases on the border between Albania and Greece, they are also increasing troops in Libya, spying on the British ×× colonies in Africa. In addition, although Germany's activities in Northern Europe have temporarily failed (the small Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland declared on the 9th that they refused the non-aggression pact offered by Germany), its conspiracy has not slackened at all, and the threat to Poland is particularly severe.</p>
<p>(2) Soviet Union's New Success in Peaceful Diplomacy</p>
<p>In today's increasingly serious war crisis, the new success of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy, like a torch in the darkness, has aroused the pursuit of peace and justice around the world, and its enthusiastic anti-aggression call has gained a wider response from the population.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs taking office on the 6th, there was a series of diplomatic victory news. The entire Soviet population and the Red Army and Navy demonstrated for this victory. First, through the efforts of Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin, the foundation for cooperation between Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, and other countries and the Soviet Union was obtained. First, the Soviet Union and Turkey issued a joint communique on the 6th, "establishing consistent goals" to enhance mutual relations and maintain collective security. All issues related to common interests should be closely contacted and information exchanged at any time" (Havas News Agency, Istanbul, 6th). Paris also reported the content of the Soviet-Turkish talks, which focused on the joint defense of Middle Eastern countries. In the future, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan will be closer. Second, the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Romania ×× Poland are becoming increasingly better, especially after Potemkin held talks in the two countries. Ambassadors to Romania and Poland have been appointed one after another. Only the anti-aggression situation and preparations in Romania and Poland have become greatly tense, and the twilight of humiliation and retreat of the Baltic Sea countries will also be swept away. Secondly, they are assuring Britain that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has not changed in the slightest, and clearly advising Britain and France. "The Soviet Union has always insisted that if Britain and France want to create a dam in Eastern Europe to stop aggression, they should sign an agreement with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as the basis, based on the principle of mutual benefit, to create a united front to protect countries that may be attacked by enemies.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The rumors and fallacies advocated by aggressors and ignorant people, such as "Soviet diplomacy turns to isolation policy" and "Germany changes its policy toward the Soviet Union," which are intended to undermine British-Soviet cooperation negotiations, have also been shattered by various facts. The British government also expressed its satisfaction and stated that it would maintain the principles of cooperation proposed to the Soviet Union. Therefore, although the British-Soviet negotiations formed a stalemate for a while, they are now showing signs of development again. In addition, France has expressed extreme disappointment with the British government's actual rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal, and has specially expressed to the Soviet side that the French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty concluded in 1935 will continue to be effective. The United States also warmly welcomes the Soviet Union's appointment of Umanzky, the Chargé d'affaires in the United States ×× Grig, as the Ambassador to the United States, and the current US-Soviet relations are friendly.</p>
<p>(3) British and French Prime Ministers Roar Like Lions</p>
<p>All hypocritical, cowardly, so-called non-interference, compromise, and capitulation policies have been settled by clear facts and have reached the point of declaring complete bankruptcy! The status of Britain and France in Europe and even in the world has reached the tragic moment when they have to be re-evaluated! The vast majority of people in Britain and France and people with great foresight, even most government officials, have also become alert, shouting and protesting to defend their country and resist aggression! In Britain, when the news that Germany had announced the abolition of the ×× Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the conclusion of the German ×× military alliance reached Britain, the whole country sighed. Newspapers solemnly pointed out the new crisis in Europe and unanimously shouted, "We need the Soviet Union," urging the government to immediately understand that the hope of dismantling the Axis countries had been shattered, and that it should now work harder to realize the British-French-Soviet alliance (Haitong News Agency, London, 8th). Workers in various parts of England also held demonstrations from the 7th ×× movement, opposing the foolish policies of the British government. Labor Party free leaders also participated in speeches, condemning all false ×× compromise policies, calling for assistance to small countries to protect themselves, and calling for the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet alliance. (Same as above) In addition, Lloyd George warned the British people loudly not to be comforted by the Japanese statement that they would not care about European events, pointing out that Japanese affairs are like spears aimed at Britain. Britain must immediately strengthen its steps to unite with the Soviet Union and aid in restraining Japan in order to save the crisis (see Havas News Agency, London, 8th). In France, the emotions of the masses were equally high. The Socialist Party ×× scheduled to hold a national congress from the 27th to the 30th of this month. Party leader Blum ×× and ×× wing leader Zyromski both advocated the implementation of a tough, uncompromising foreign policy, to unite all nations determined to defend freedom, and organize an anti-fascist group. They have prepared proposals to fight against fascist aggression and strive for the independence and freedom of their country, and to strive for the defense of socialism and peace (see Havas News Agency, Paris, 8th). In this environment, the British and French governments cannot but be alert! What has been shown in the affairs of the week is: First, the British King and Queen set out on the 3rd to visit Canada and the United States. The government and the public warmly welcomed them, and the United States has also prepared a grand welcome, which will be of considerable help to British-American-Canadian relations. Second, the British, French, and Turkish governments have agreed to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, the content of which includes the establishment of a mutual defense agreement in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and all areas related to Turkish interests. Third, the French government declared that the French-Soviet agreement remains in effect. Fourth, the British-Soviet cooperation negotiations continue. Fifth, the British and Japanese trade agreement was signed on the 11th. Sixth, Britain is urgently seeking to strengthen its Far East defense forces. On the 11th, a Reuters dispatch from London reported that the British naval commander in the East Sea will hold a meeting in Singapore to discuss plans for coordinated operations in the East and West during wartime. Finally, British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech on the 11th that was considered a "lion's roar," warning Germany not to invade Danzig, otherwise Britain could not stand idly by. French Prime Minister Daladier also reiterated France's firm stance on the same day, preparing to resist any aggression, and hoping that the Soviet Union would participate in mutual assistance. Under the pressure of the situation, the British and French governments will have to embark on a united front against fascist aggression!</p>
<p>(4) Japan ×× Seizes the Opportunity to Agitate</p>
<p>As the European situation becomes increasingly urgent, the Eastern aggressor, Japan ××, who has suffered heavy military injuries, will naturally seize the opportunity to agitate in order to solve its current difficulties and then attempt to realize its dream of dominating East Asia. But its main strategies are still nothing more than deception and threat. And its main targets are Britain, France, and the United States, especially Britain.</p>
<p>Its first step is still to deceive the country and tempt it. When the news of Germany and Italy agreeing to establish a military alliance came out, it was silent and even unofficially expressed that Japan would not participate in the German-Italian military alliance, and maliciously rumored that the alliance's foreign policy had changed after Litvinov resigned, and maliciously rumored that Germany and the Soviet Union were approaching, which would cause Japan ×× to take a policy of being friendly with democratic countries. On the one hand, it also expanded its anti-communist propaganda as if it were a real thing, stating that its military aggression against China was only for the purpose of anti-communism. Although this deceptive and tempting performance temporarily touched the "hearts" of a few stubborn elements among the capitalist rulers of democratic countries, its fox tail and sharp blade could not be hidden after all. At a meeting of the British House of Commons on the 8th, Lloyd George loudly pointed out: "Japan's advancement is like a spear aimed at the border of British ×× land. Since the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet, Japanese troops have advanced 200 miles towards India!"</p>
<p>Moreover, the threat of Japan ×× is even more alarming. First, in order to seize the concessions of Britain, the United States, and France in China, they are intensifying their threats to the Shanghai concession. On the 3rd of this month, they issued a note to the British and American ambassadors, demanding the thorough reorganization of the administrative organization of the public concession. Then, they expanded the propaganda for the Japanese government to take over the concession. On the 7th of this month, they also pressed the concession to ban anti-Japanese organizations and publications and arrested anti-Japanese reporters. On the 9th, they sent plainclothes to the concession to kidnap five Chinese people, accusing them of being anti-Japanese elements. On the one hand, on the second day of the first anniversary of the fall of Xiamen (the 12th of this month) ×× traitor ×× was erected and killed, and they even landed in ×× Lang ×× and bombed Asia Oil ××, further threatening Britain, the United States, and other countries. We know that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China and the capital of a small number of civilians who have escaped from the artillery fire have mostly been concentrated in the concessions and leased territories that have not been reached by the ×× army. This time, the intention of Japan ×× to threaten Britain and the United States to loot them is very obvious. Second, continue to carry out crazy bombings in large, undefended cities in China and South China. Its intention is not only to target the Chinese people, but also to thoroughly destroy the economic activities of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly countries in China. If this is not enough, the ×× Army's newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" published an article on the 11th threatening the personal safety of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. We must recognize from here that this kind of agitation by Japan ×× is planned, and its purpose is to destroy the international assistance of our country's adherence to the War of Resistance and to thoroughly strike at the rights and economic activities of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly countries in China. If the British and American authorities still allow the Shanghai concession authorities to adopt the same humiliating and compromising countermeasures, then what was Tianjin yesterday, what is Shanghai and Gulangyu today, and what will be Hong Kong and India tomorrow and the day after tomorrow? A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 10th has revealed that Japan ×× is planning to demarcate the territory north of the equator as its jurisdiction and to assist overseas Chinese in carrying out conspiracy activities to intensify its southward advance. "Nichinichi Shimbun" even advocated the establishment of a governor-general to specialize in the affairs of Japanese residents in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Singapore in order to support the southward advance plan.</p>
<p>(5) Wang Jingwei and others Intensify their Activities</p>
<p>The new agitation of the aforementioned Japan ×× is aimed at striking at the interests of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East, striving for a large amount of brutal oppression and the status of ××. On the other hand, it is aimed at striking at the friendly assistance of our insistence on the War of Resistance. In addition to attempting to weaken our War of Resistance forces internationally and then attempting to force us to surrender, Japan ×× continues to use Wang Jingwei to carry out the national policy of using Chinese to control Chinese and using Chinese ×× Chinese. First, the "anti-communist, peace" movement is used to destroy our anti-Japanese national united front and alienate the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all ethnic groups in the country, and the people and the government. According to a special telegram report from a Hong Kong-based ×× correspondent stationed in Shanghai, Wang Jingwei recently went to Japan and returned to Shanghai on the 10th of this month, accompanied by Kagesa Konoe and others. That night, the traitor Xiao An held a grand banquet to welcome Wang. According to the results of Wang's direct consultation with Japan ××, the Tokyo side has generally approved the conditions that Wang discussed with the Japanese representative in Shanghai, so Wang rushed back to carry out everything with his party members. As for the so-called conditions discussed with the Japanese side in Shanghai, they are roughly: (1) Announce that the state affairs will be directed by ××; (2) Announce a truce with Japan; (3) Do not ask Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to arbitrate; (4) Chiang Kai-shek steps down, the party is handed over to Wang, the army is handed over to ×××, and the government is handed over to ××; (5) Recognize the two puppet governments of Weixin and temporary as local governments, do not exclude them, and then negotiate with all parties to establish a puppet central government; (6) Sign an anti-communist agreement and an economic agreement with Japan, hire Japanese technicians ×× consultants, Japan has commercial leases in the mainland, and recognize the puppet Manchukuo, etc. According to a special telegram from the Zhujiang Daily in Hong Kong on the 12th, Wang went to Tokyo on April 27 and returned on May 3. In Japan, he negotiated with the Japanese government to organize a puppet Chinese Commonwealth government. Wang once requested the Japanese government to provide 30 million yuan per day for the central government's expenses. Although the true content of Wang ××'s future conspiracy activities is not yet known, it is already confirmed that Wang's current conspiracy activities are continuing and intensifying ××. We have said before: "When Wang Jingwei's peace movement fails, he can only. go to ×× openly." This kind of behavior violates the interests of the entire Chinese nation and violates the public will of the entire Chinese people. It is not necessary to point out that its future destiny cannot be stronger than that of Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, and Wen Zongyao. What we think is particularly important to awaken everyone's attention is that the Central News Agency's Kunming telegram on the 3rd published by Hong Kong newspapers on the 7th of this month released a letter from Yunnan Chairman Long Yun to Wang Jingwei. From this letter, we can see that Wang Jingwei has been secretly bewitching military and political officials in our government until recently, and has been carrying out various conspiracies within our anti-Japanese united front: Therefore, today we must not only step up the mobilization of the national people to resolutely oppose Wang Jingwei's kind of open ×× actions, oppose the kind of activities that are openly organizing and inheriting the puppet central government ××, but also especially ask the national officials and people to raise their political vigilance. We would like to express our greatest enthusiasm and highest respect to all those who are being instigated by Wang ×× and hope that they can all learn from Chairman Long Yun's loyal, brave, and righteous behavior, at least if they want to "not be driven by temporary anger and fall into thorns!" At the same time, we ×× resolutely demand that Wang ×× and others be given strict ×× sanctions, and that all anti-communist and equal remarks and actions that violate the War of Resistance and national reconstruction be thoroughly cleaned up. We resolutely demand that the united front be further consolidated and expanded. The spirit of democratic politics and the improvement of people's lives should be more appropriately developed and more effectively implemented in order to fundamentally block the road of ××××× ×× activities!</p>
<p>(6) The Situation of the War of Resistance against Japan in a Week</p>
<p>Finally, we will report on the recent week's War of Resistance situation. First of all, on the Japanese ×× side, the new offensive that has been preparing for nearly half a year has not yet succeeded. On the contrary, the severity of the domestic crisis in Japan and the degradation of its military strength in China. Looking at the telegrams of this week alone, first, Japan's domestic embarrassment is even more severe: (1) The Reuters Tokyo telegram reported on May 9 that Agriculture Minister Sakurauchi claimed that "Japanese rural areas all feel that there is a shortage of manpower. Because most of the strong men ×× are conscripted to attack China, and farmers in various places are also working in munitions factories, etc., agricultural production is on the verge of despair. At the same time, due to the lack of raw materials, many industries have fallen into stagnation!" (2) The surge of anti-war sentiment, the Zhujiang Daily Shanghai telegram on the 12th claimed. "The anti-war sentiment in the × country is increasing day by day, and the public order is unstable. Therefore, it was decided to convene a judicial meeting on the 15th to discuss the elimination of those who violate economic control and communist elements, etc., and the judicial chiefs of Korea and Taiwan will also participate!" (3), Quick News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. (Shanghai Translation Newspaper, May 9) "In the past few days, Tokyo ×× has been in ×× In the city, a large-scale search and arrest of members of the Seiyukai who were not members of the National Assembly has been carried out. So far, more than 200 people have been arrested and will be accused of disrupting the order ××". Second, regarding the decline of the fighting power of the invading Japanese army, it can be clearly seen from the recent progress of our army's counter-offensive ××. At the same time, news of internal riots and ×× army counter-reports is becoming even more of a daily event than before! But this does not mean that Japan ×× has lost its remaining power to launch a new offensive. On the contrary, Japan ×× is still exaggerating this kind of ×× in order to show off its military strength, such as the continued crazy bombing ×× of various cities in South China in the past week, which is one example. According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 9th, Japanese officials announced on the 9th that in order to "end the war against China," ×× they will immediately ×× fully implement Japan's General Mobilization Law and unify the command of the Japanese army and navy." From this, it can be seen that Japan ×× is about to prepare its possible, but even more crazy and cruel final bet! As for us, in order to prevent the new offensive of Japan ××, since the launch of the counter-offensive on all fronts, we have been fighting hard and reporting victories everywhere, which has encouraged the people and ×× has given international importance ××. In the past week, there were 32 members of the British House of Lords and the House of Commons ×× ×× ×× Weier and others who telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their respect and congratulate our country's entire army and people on their bloodshed and victory in the War of Resistance for national freedom. In the past week, there has been important news from the front lines of various routes: On the northern battlefield. Our army in southern Jin attacked Fushan, Yicheng, and Xinjiang. ×× The military killed more than 7,000 people. In eastern Jin, about 2,000 people were killed. In recent days, the area around Jing ×× in northwestern Jin has ×× about 10,000 people. The He Long Department of the Eighth Route Army, with more than 3,000 people, captured Jinci on the 5th and has entered ×× Taiyuan. In Shandong, the counter-offensive along the Jinpu and Jiaoji lines was also very successful, and once attacked Dezhou and raided Yantai. There are still fierce battles near Kaifeng ×× and around Xuzhou on the sea line. According to a Quick News Agency report from Chongqing on the 7th, Deputy Commander Feng Yuxiang flew from Nanyang to ×× Zhou on the 5th to convene a meeting of generals, instructed the counter-offensive on the Longhai Line, and sent a large number of elite troops from Luo to the front of the Longhai. On the eastern battlefield, there were also victories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in recent days. The Liao Lei Department of the Fifth Route Army attacked Anqing on the evening of the 6th, and street battles continued until the 8th, causing heavy losses to the ×× army. According to an Shanghai telegram on the 12th, General Gu Zhutong ×× strengthened the eastern line counter-offensive ×× and decided to transfer 100,000 elite troops to advance into the guerrilla area of Jiangnan and appointed a commissioner to command the 8th Chang and Fu ××. On the South China Southern battlefield, the encirclement of Guangzhou by our army continued to make progress, and the guerrillas mixed into the Guangdong market and cooperated with the people in the Guangdong market to resist ××. In recent days, there have also been achievements, such as attacking the Bank of Taiwan, etc. In the Jianghui area, ×× continued to ×× fierce fighting and recovered Xinhui on the 11th, defeating the ×× army's plan to invade southward. Since General Bai Chongxi went on a tour of the Southern battlefield and convened a meeting of ×× political officials and stained people and gave a speech, there will be important instructions for the future War of Resistance. Finally, in southern Hubei and northern Jiangxi, which became the center of the war in the past week, our army also won victories, such as re-entering Nanchang, and recovering ×× Xianning Fengxin, approaching Tongcheng, making the ×× army's plan to invade Changsha Zhuzhou suffer a major blow. And the ×× army's propaganda "encircling more than 20 divisions of the Chinese army" The war east of ×× Fan is actually our army carrying out a dismemberment ×× of ×× based on its superior position. Even if the ×× army has further adventures in the future, it will inevitably suffer greater blows.</p>
<p>Summing up the war situation in a week, we can say that we are still standing on the superior side! However, in order to effectively attack the new offensive of the ×× army, we should not only enhance the combat effectiveness of the ×× Guandong to Chaozhou, enhance the combat effectiveness of the ×× Hunan-Jiangxi border and the front line of Xijiang on the south road, but also step up the expansion of the combat behind the ×× army on the eastern battlefield and the northern battlefield, and all of these depend on political progress, the consolidation of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the thoroughness of the traitor elimination movement, and the smooth implementation of the mobilization of the people.</p>
<h3>Intensify Production and Persist in Resistance (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Fuchun</p>
<p>5.  Production Campaign and Preparatory Work</p>
<p>Regarding preparatory work, first, we must seize the opportunity. A year's plan starts in the spring; when spring arrives, the opportunity must not be missed! We must "not delay the farming season." Before the spring plowing, we must complete all preparatory work. So, what should we prepare?</p>
<p>First, survey the land—the government and the Party Committee should issue a notice to complete the survey work within a time limit; in Ansebao and other counties, the survey should be completed clearly within half a month; the area within twenty li around Yan'an should be surveyed clearly within five days. After the survey is completed, we can appropriately regulate the land and the labor force.</p>
<p>Second, preparation of ploughing oxen, seeds, and fertilizers—regarding the preparation of ploughing oxen, seeds, and fertilizers, on the one hand, each department should find ways to solve a part of the problem themselves; at the same time, the Finance Department should plan to purchase a large number of ploughing oxen and whole batches of seeds and distribute them to various departments. From all aspects, we can certainly quickly complete our preparatory work.</p>
<p>Third, preparation of agricultural production tools—in addition to each agency solving a part of the problem themselves, a plan should be made to send special personnel to various counties outside the border region to purchase a large number of agricultural tools. If this still cannot solve the problem, some scrap iron should be collected immediately, and the General Labor Union should be asked to mobilize blacksmiths to manufacture a large number of agricultural tools.</p>
<p>Fourth, preparation of personnel: At present, we should search for agricultural specialists and experienced people from all aspects to provide good guidance when carrying out production work.</p>
<p>Fifth, completion of mobilization work: In the countryside and among the people in agencies, schools, and troops, mobilization meetings for the production campaign should be convened immediately to carry out full explanation and mobilization work and to greet the new tasks with a new spirit.</p>
<p>6.  Organizations Leading the Production Campaign</p>
<p>After the correct policy and specific plan are determined, the organizational work determines everything! How can we ensure the completion of our unprecedented great production plan? This requires us to have a strong organizational leadership to solve problems regularly, supervise and inspect work, and ensure the completion of production tasks. Otherwise, the so-called "great plan" is just a piece of empty talk. Hundreds of thousands of dan of grain will not fall from the sky.</p>
<p>First, establish a production campaign committee—large departments should establish a general production campaign committee. (For example, the central agencies should establish a general production committee directly under the Central Secretariat.) Each department and each mess unit should also establish a production committee for that department or unit, which is led by the general production committee. The production committee of each unit should have a specific division of labor and should have: cadres specializing in managing organization, labor, and allocation of labor; cadres specializing in managing economy and production tools; cadres specializing in supervising and inspecting work; in the Party system, each branch should set up production cadres to ensure the smooth progress of production work. After the establishment of the general production committee and the production committees of various departments and units, they should actively carry out work.</p>
<p>Second, the specific work of the production committee.</p>
<p>1. Carry out mobilization work for the production campaign.</p>
<p>2. Carry out education work for the production campaign, so that every member participating in the production campaign understands the importance of the production campaign politically and understands how to carry out production technically.</p>
<p>3. Organization and regulation of labor force: the labor force should be well organized; in the process of production, the phenomenon of fatigue is unavoidable. We must regulate the labor force, not only to carry out regular encouragement work but also to allow the fatigued to get proper rest.</p>
<p>4. Establish a work inspection system.</p>
<p>5. Establish an award system to reward model comrades and comrades with good production results.</p>
<p>6. Conduct research work: Because the production campaign is unprecedented, our leading organ, the Production Campaign Committee, should continuously study the experiences and lessons learned in production practice as the basis for improving and developing work in the future.</p>
<p>7. Publish the results of the research in all publications in the entire border region—newspapers, magazines, and broadcasts—to guide our production campaign, exchange experiences, and promote the progress of the campaign, so that it advances by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Comrades! Under the call of the Central Committee, how should each of us complete our tasks?</p>
<p>We must use tenacity and combativeness to overcome all difficulties and fight to complete the arduous and great tasks given to us by the Central Committee! We believe that in the summary of this year's spring plowing and autumn herding, victory will surely be ours!</p>

<h3>Large Army Concentrated on Henan Border; Preliminary Battles Erupted Between Xiangyang and Zhongxiang; Our Fresh Troops in Western Henan Attacked Tanghe</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] The battles on various fronts are more intense in central Hubei. Over the past week, forces attacked from the Hua-Xiang Road and Zhongxiang. We first killed over a thousand and inflicted heavy losses. Fierce fighting is currently taking place near Zhongxiang. The enemy's rear has been cut off and is quite panicked. In Jiangxi, we annihilated no less than three to four thousand enemy troops in Nanchang.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] In southern Guangdong, after we captured Xinhui and Jiangmen, morale was greatly boosted. Our guerrillas are attacking the enemy everywhere, achieving considerable gains. Earlier this month, the enemy amassed over a thousand troops and launched a multi-pronged attack southward, which we repelled, killing three hundred enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 13th] Among the various occupied areas, our troops have been active recently. Recently, we recovered Tancheng County in southern Shandong, and the county magistrate entered the city to reassure the people. The provincial government allocated two million yuan to relieve the disaster victims. On the Jinpu Railway at Dawenkou, south of Guozhuang, we destroyed an enemy military vehicle. It is reported that recently three smoke bombs exploded in the commercial area of Jinan, causing a great deal of panic during the chaos as someone distributed leaflets. Our guerrillas are active near Qingdao. Prices of goods are soaring, and counterfeit currency has become worthless paper. Anti-British sentiment is quite high in the area. The British颐中Company and祥泰Wood Factory have both suspended operations, and British nationals are preparing to return home en masse if necessary.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese sources report that 10,000 Japanese troops were discovered southeast of Xiangyang today, attempting to invade the southern part of Henan Province. Chinese troops are now concentrated along the Xiangyang-Fuyang Highway and the Henan-Hubei border with 100,000 soldiers, awaiting an opportunity to annihilate the invading Japanese forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 12th] Over a thousand Japanese troops who fled north from Zhongxiang on the 8th arrived at a place more than forty li from Xiangfan. After a fierce counterattack by our troops, the enemy fled northeast. On the 12th, our fresh troops suddenly attacked Tanghe from western Henan, engaging the enemy in fierce fighting south of Tanghe. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered a major setback, with more than half of them killed or wounded. Another unit of ours is rapidly pursuing the enemy in the direction of Zaoyang, also achieving significant results.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the morning of the 12th, over two thousand enemy troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, advanced towards Xihe in three routes: one route from Zhangdian Town (southwest of Tanghe), one route from a village (south of Tanghe), and one route from Yingku (south of Tanghe), launching a fierce attack on us. We are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese sources report that a squadron of Chinese aircraft assisted the Chinese army yesterday in attacking Japanese troops near Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway. As a result, the Japanese army's depot and arsenal were completely destroyed, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. This squadron previously achieved success in Yingshan, launching a surprise attack on the Japanese army assembled there. Subsequent battle reports indicate that the Japanese troops in that area were completely annihilated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the 10th, about one thousand enemy and puppet troops who infiltrated Xinye were attacked by our large forces from Nanyang, Zhenping, Dengxian, and other places. On the 11th, the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, fled southeast of Xinye. We are currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanggao, 12th] On the evening of the 11th, our army captured Husu, eight li north of Anyi, killing dozens of enemy soldiers. When enemy reinforcements arrived, we left with our spoils of war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changde, 12th] Frontline report: (1) Yesterday, a certain unit of our guerrillas launched a fierce attack on Matang, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (2) Enemy boats anchored on the dikes of Yueyang do not dare to roam the Dongting Lake. But as soon as our garrison fires with guns, they flee far away.</p>
<h3>Our Troops in Northern Jiangsu Recovered Pizhou County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tunxi, 13th] On the 4th, a certain unit of our troops in northern Jiangsu launched a second fierce attack on Pizhou County. Over four hundred enemy soldiers stubbornly resisted. Our troops shouted and rushed into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the enemy. After three hours of bloody battle, over three hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and the remaining enemy troops fled towards the south bank of the Grand Canal. On the 5th, our Pizhou County Magistrate Gan Huayun entered the city to reassure the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 12th] Military news: Our scattered commando units in the eastern battlefield, along with several regular army divisions, have launched fierce battles with the enemy, posing a major threat to the enemy army and cutting the Sujia Railway into several sections, closely monitoring the enemy and puppet movements around Songjiang and Tongli. In addition, Yangtang Town, southwest of Suzhou, was fiercely attacked by our army on the 10th, annihilating over fifty enemy soldiers and recovering the town.</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Occupied Area is Becoming Increasingly Small</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingyuan, 12th] Over the past week, the war in Guangdong has turned silent. The enemy has adopted an offensive posture on the southwest front, launching an all-out attack on Jiangmen and Xinhui on the right flank of our western line, attempting to sweep through Siyi and Liangyang and directly attack the southern route. Our military authorities, aware of the enemy's plan, not only ordered the defending troops on that front to fight hard but also launched counterattacks with extremely mobile movements. In the Sanshui area, we recovered Makou and attacked Sanshui and other places, directly approaching the outskirts of Qingshui City. The enemy had no choice but to withdraw the troops attacking Jiangmen and began to retreat to the defensive positions of Hancheng and Xialegang. On the left flank of the western line, at Lubao on the southwest highway, we recovered Yangmei and Baorutang. After the enemy counterattacked, we did not retreat. On the roads of Chan (Foshan) and Tan (Bu), we counterattacked and captured Guanyao, advancing to Zhaogang. The enemy was greatly threatened and had to withdraw troops from Foshan and Jiangmen to fight back. Our army then moved from Guanyao to Tanbu and steadfastly defended Sanjiang. Later, the enemy increased its deployment of infantry and artillery to over a thousand troops to attack. We firmly defended our positions and fought back. The enemy did not succeed. Tanbu and Sanjiang are key points for connecting our northwest rivers. Cutting them off would not only allow the enemy to "mop up" the guerrillas in the junction area of Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian counties and relieve the threat to the enemy's left flank at Jiangcun and Tangtang on the southern section of the Yuehan Road but also allow the army to plunder old Qingyuan and force Yingde. On the Gaoyao and Gaoming roads on the right flank of the western line, the enemy sent speedboats and rubber boats to attack Sanzhou, but they were repelled by our army and could not land. On the Jiangmen-Foshan highway, west of Pishan, the enemy attacked Gubao. Our army gathered national troops and fought five times with the enemy. The enemy was defeated and collapsed to the east. Our troops on the front line of the Ningyang Railway were able to calmly attack the enemy and launched a protracted war in the Xinhui area. For more than ten days, the enemy could not cross our defense line. The enemy occupying Jiangmen has now changed its attack to defense. From then on, the enemy in Guangzhou, is living in constant panic. They have recently built a defensive line in Kuabei's Longyan , preparing for a final stand. The outer perimeter of the defensive line is the Yuehan Road's Xin Street and Jiangcun in the north, and the Guangzhou-Conghua line's Shengang and Taipingchang in the northeast, preparing for a final stubborn resistance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Conduct House-to-House Searches on Gulangyu; U.S. Warship Ordered to Sail from Fujian to Protect Nationals; British Warship Closely Coordinates with Consulate General</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 13th] According to sources on Gulangyu, Japanese marines have begun conducting house-to-house searches on Gulangyu. The British destroyer HMS "Curlew" is constantly in contact with the Consul General. As of now, no reports of infringement on British interests have been received. Cargo from Swire &amp; Co. ships has not been unloaded because workers are afraid and refuse to work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Shanghai, 13th] The U.S. destroyer USS "Bulmer" has been ordered to sail from Fuzhou to Gulangyu and is expected to arrive today. The ship carries Rear Admiral Starke, commander of the U.S. South China Patrol.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Foreign dispatches from Gulangyu on the 13th: A total of two hundred Japanese soldiers have landed here, and a large number of Chinese have been arrested by the Japanese.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gulangyu, 13th] Since the assassination of the puppet "Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Chairman" Hong Lizhu on Thursday (i.e., the 11th), the Japanese have sent two hundred sailors to land here, arresting many Chinese. Hong's injuries remain critical. The assassin is still at large. Japanese marines are closely monitoring all entrances and exits here, intending to prevent Chinese from fleeing. The Japanese have warned Chinese that anyone wanting to leave Gulangyu will be regarded as anti-Japanese elements.</p>
<h3>Tensions Increase in Shanghai; Rumors of New Japanese Residents' Association Plans; Japanese Aircraft Drop Leaflets in Concession Central Area</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 13th] Tensions rose again today after Japanese reports that the Japanese Residents' Association is stepping up efforts to organize residents to assist Japanese officials in modifying the Shanghai land regulations in an attempt to repel British and American forces and gain control of the Public Concession. However, there have been no new developments on the diplomatic front. This morning, a Japanese plane repeatedly flew over the office of the Municipal Council and dropped a large number of leaflets. Everyone originally thought they were propaganda against the Municipal Council, but it turns out that they were recruitment advertisements for the puppet government's water police school, saying that they want to recruit two hundred people for training, with a monthly allowance of eight yuan per person.</p>
<h3>Japanese Land on Gulangyu; Britain and the United States Express Importance; U.S. Has Contingency Plans for Incidents in Shanghai Concession</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, London, 13th] Political circles here believe that the Japanese military's landing in the Gulangyu Concession in Xiamen does not violate the original text of the treaty, but if the Japanese military intends to interfere in the Concession administration, the consequences will be extremely serious.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 13th] Authoritative sources in the United States remain tight-lipped about the Japanese military's seizure of the Gulangyu Public Concession in Xiamen. According to private sources in political circles, the United States is closely watching the actions of the Japanese military, especially the steps the Japanese military is attempting to take towards the Concession. It is rumored that this may lead to economic sanctions against Japan. Secretary of State Hull told representatives of the press that he had not yet received a formal report from the Ambassador to China and therefore could not comment on the importance of the Japanese military's actions. When asked whether the United States would impose economic sanctions if the Japanese military took similar steps in Shanghai, he said that the U.S. Ambassador to China had been instructed to deal with all situations in serious times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Hull stated that difficulties may arise at any time in Shanghai, the Far East, and other places, so the State Department has authorized diplomatic representatives in those places to deal with the situation there nearby. Regarding the remarks made by a Japanese spokesman that the Japanese side may find it necessary to seize the British and American defense areas in Shanghai, there have been no official reports received here. As for the saying that if the Japanese side attempts to occupy Shanghai, the British and American authorities will study taking a certain attitude, the official side here has not made any comments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Washington telegram: A senior official of the State Department, after learning of the Japanese military's occupation of Gulangyu, declared that the United States is very concerned about this and is closely watching the development of the situation.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Air Defense Has Improved Significantly; City Orderly During Japanese Airstrike the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 13th] At 6:20 p.m. yesterday evening, a general alarm sounded. At that time, the streets and markets were lively, but in a moment, the people of the city dispersed, and the order was in good order. When the Japanese bomber squadron intruded into the city sky, it was already dusk, so the targets of the Japanese aircraft were completely inaccurate. Most of them fell into the Jialing River and on the beaches along the river. The city's police and soldiers went to the streets to maintain order and strictly enforce fire control. Twelve police officers accompanied the Associated Press reporter on foot in the street. When they suddenly saw a faint light on a building on a certain street, they went to investigate and extinguished it. A big fire suddenly broke out in two villages in Jiangbei, and thick smoke covered the area. Most of the people who moved to live there were those who moved from Chongqing, which was originally considered quite safe. Several bombs also fell near the German Consulate, but there were no casualties. The French Navy barracks reported the work of the Health Department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 12th] Chinese sources report that 27 Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing today, and Chinese anti-aircraft guns shot down three of them. Japanese aircraft bombed the new refugee area on the north bank of the Jialing River yesterday, with casualties estimated at over a thousand. One middle school, with 600 students, was also hit. It is reported that most of the students have escaped, but foreigners in Chongqing have heard screams from that area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 13th] When Japanese aircraft bombed here last night, they completely focused on the east bank of the Yangtze River, at the confluence with the Jialing River. The small towns on the north bank of the Jialing River were the most targeted by the Japanese aircraft. Rescue workers crossed the river overnight to provide aid. It is said that the casualties were light, only about 300 people, because most of the residents had fled after hearing the alarm. Japanese aircraft bombed near the French Navy barracks, and a fire broke out immediately. The American-owned衛利韓Shipping Company, located 200 yards away, was completely destroyed. French sailors helped firefighters to fight the fire to prevent it from spreading to the French barracks. Report of the work of the Health Department</p>
<h3>Yan Fuqing Talks About Reporting on the Work of the Health Department</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 13th] Director of the Health Department, Dr. Yan Fuqing, declared that Japanese aircraft cruelly bombed Chongqing on May 1st and 4th, killing 5,000 people and injuring 2,000 people, and 2,391 houses were destroyed. Speaking of the results of this war, Yan said that, to date, the enemy's casualties have exceeded one million. Approximately six million children have lost their parents and must be cared for and educated by the government. The number of refugees is as high as five million, of whom 1,600 are currently fully supported by the government. Speaking of the lack of doctors and nurses, Yan said that China has trained 9,000 doctors and only 6,000 nurses, which is far from the number needed. The military medical department in the army currently has 300,000 wounded soldiers and 20,000 staff.</p>
<h3>People in Southern Shanxi Unable to Bear Oppression; Organize Righteous Army to Kill Japanese; Japanese in Central Shanxi Invade Wenshui in Three Routes; 5,000 Japanese Soldiers in Taiyuan Reinforce Wutai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] The people of various counties in southern Shanxi, unable to bear the cruelty of the Japanese, have risen up in revolt and organized righteous armies. The people who voluntarily participate are very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency and Collection, 12th] The Fenan Japanese army is planning to build four roads connecting Tongguan Road, Shuitou Station, Chazhuang, Hejin, and Yuncheng. Our various units are cooperating with the local people to attack them. Wheat seedlings on both sides of the Hejin-Jishan highway. The Japanese army has been forcing Liu for days. In addition to the people of Fenxi hating them to the core, the people in other places are also using the slogan of safeguarding food and rising up to attack the Japanese. The Japanese and puppet troops in Xinjiang Jishan were frequently attacked by us and recently sent several armored vehicles to drive on the highway day and night to prevent our attacks. On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese in Xinjiang killed eleven soldiers who had previously been captured by us outside the city. That night, the Japanese in the city suddenly spread rumors that our army was attacking and most of them drove out of the city and bombarded the northwest for several hours. In fact, our army did not take any action. The panic of the Japanese can be seen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] The Northeastern compatriots have been oppressed by the Japanese and the puppets. On the 4th of this month, more than ten Japanese puppets forced them to cut down trees in Zhoucun. More than forty of them, seeing that the time for rebellion had come, rose up and tied up all the Japanese soldiers who were supervising them and surrendered to a certain army of ours. Our army gave them comfort and incorporated them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] More than 4,000 Japanese troops from Qixian, Pingyao, Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng launched a fierce attack on Hujia Village and Xiejiacai, northeast of Wenshui, in three routes. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely with the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat dozens of times and finally broke through the encirclement. It is estimated that over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 12th] On the 4th and 5th, the Japanese sent more than 5,000 Japanese troops and ten artillery pieces from Taiyuan to reinforce Wutai. At the same time, more than 1,000 troops were also added to Dongpan Town. On the 7th, they fought fiercely with us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingji, 12th] A certain detachment of our army destroyed about three miles of railway east of Zhengtaiyangquan on the evening of the 5th. Another unit attacked Xiyang City on the night of the 6th and fought fiercely for two hours. The Japanese stubbornly resisted the city, and our army withdrew automatically at dawn.</p>
<h3>The Possibilities of Economic Reconstruction in the Rear Area</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhang</p>
<p>I. Introduction to the Problem</p>
<p>[A Communication from the Shanxi-Western Suiyuan Area of the Kuomintang] In addition to military offensives, the Japanese also employ a variety of economic, political, and cultural schemes and conspiracies. A particularly serious issue is economic aggression coordinated with military activities. They exhaust all means of blockade, destruction, and plunder, attempting to weaken our economic structure to compensate for their own economic difficulties. Modern warfare is a final showdown involving the mobilization of manpower, materials, and financial resources. In a prolonged war, if the condition of manpower does not become a problem, then the final victory depends on the duration and extent of financial and material resources. At the same time, in our national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, the defense-oriented economic construction in the rear has laid a solid foundation and enhanced the conditions necessary for a certain victory in the war of resistance. However, we believe that what is insufficient is that the nation, both government and public, concentrates its attention in one corner, only focusing on the investigation and development of the southwestern defense base, neglecting the overall nature of national construction, and neglecting most of the fertile land that has become war zones. On the land between several railways and inland waterways, the political power is ours, the army is ours. Although these anti-Japanese base areas in the rear are surrounded by the Japanese and are subject to attack at any time, in such difficult circumstances, we still have to consider the economic construction of the base areas. This is easier said than done, but we cannot give up this arduous task just because of the difficulties. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed us long ago: "The Japanese blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic recovery." Therefore, this article will first present the necessity and possibility of economic construction in the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear, and report on the construction situation of the southeastern Shanxi anti-Japanese base area, which has been working hard for half a year and has achieved remarkable results. This will show how it has enriched the new tasks of the guerrillas, protected the lives and property of the people, established the economic foundation of rural areas, laid the foundation for the revival of national industry, and tell our compatriots in the rear that national construction does not have to wait until the day after the Japanese are driven out beyond the Yalu River to begin. Nor is it enough to retreat to one corner of the southwest to build the nation.</p>
<p>II. The Necessity of Economic Construction in the Rear Area</p>
<p>A. Consolidating the economic structure of the anti-Japanese base areas and directly supplying the needs of the army.</p>
<p>The Japanese policy of economic aggression against us is to blockade the sources of our necessities and essential goods, and to use shoddy and substandard goods to sell goods and daily necessities, using unscrupulous merchants to dump them in various places, absorb our legal currency, and mix in counterfeit money and counterfeit legal currency to disrupt our financial and monetary system. Secondly, it is the large amount of raw materials that we usually export, such as fur, raw silk, cotton, hemp, peanuts, tobacco, etc. At this time, hoarding leads to inability to convert to cash. We even have to resort to good merchants to sell some of the raw materials at a reduced price into the hands of the Japanese. Moreover, the transportation links between the anti-Japanese base areas and the rear areas have been or will be cut off. The supply of military and civilian supplies will be difficult, which means that there will be difficulties in supporting the long-term war of resistance. A powerful countermeasure to solve these difficulties is to develop the economic construction of the anti-Japanese base areas. First and foremost, run small and medium-sized production enterprises that are most urgently needed, and use the raw materials accumulated on the spot to maintain self-sufficiency in military and civilian needs within the base area, break through the Japanese control in the economy, and cultivate a greater counterattack force.</p>
<p>B. Increasing wartime production to solve the refugee problem. Wherever the Japanese go, a group of refugees is added. The number caused to date is estimated to be no less than 50 to 60 million. This is a major problem for the War of Resistance. Although the central government has allocated a huge sum of millions of yuan and sent personnel to the war zone to distribute it, the war zone is too vast and there are too many refugees. Apart from temporary emergency relief, the fundamental solution is to recruit them to join the army and engage in production, assign them to wasteland reclamation areas to increase food production, and to send them to ordnance factories and military supplies manufacturing factories, to transport teams, and laundry teams.</p>
<p>C. Developing rural economic organizations, promoting political organizations, and carrying out mass movement work for farmers with low cultural levels and strong feudal consciousness, especially rural women, to organize and arm them is very difficult. If we use mass organizations and production organizations to absorb their small shares of capital and recruit them to work in factories, so that they have economic and work relationships, it will be very easy to promote the work of educating and training them.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of the war, several transportation lines and several large cities quickly fell into Japanese hands. Some businessmen still stayed in the occupied areas. Some local gentry believed that it was difficult to operate with money in the countryside, so they tried to invest in the occupied areas or remit money abroad. Some even took large amounts of assets to major cities or concessions. There were also a large number of workers trapped in the occupied areas working in Japanese factories. These escapees must be recovered. It is no less important to win over these manpower that has fallen into Japanese hands than it is to disintegrate the Japanese, destroy the puppet organizations, and win over the puppet troops. That is, to establish production enterprises and bring back the manpower and financial resources that have fallen into the occupied areas, and combine them economically, so that they can no longer leave their homeland.</p>
<p>III. Difficulties and Possibilities</p>
<p>It is very difficult to engage in economic construction in the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear, but there are also possibilities. With the protection of the army, the assistance of the government, and the mobilization of the masses, it is possible to carry out rational production control, transportation control, and consumption control. Moreover, it is possible to widely establish rural production units and establish a large number of small industries related to military and civilian needs - small-scale machinery industries. The following is a breakdown:</p>
<p>A. Increasing food production. As the anti-Japanese base areas in the rear are established and consolidated one by one, the more progress they make, the more they are hated by the Japanese and puppet forces. Especially as the war enters a stalemate, the Japanese have already surrounded and attacked various anti-Japanese base areas. They exhaust all means of cruel and destructive attacks, and often choose the time of spring plowing and autumn harvest, so that you cannot plant anything or harvest anything. At the same time, in places where we have a large number of troops stationed, because of the need to cope with the war situation, the army recruits coolies and wants livestock, which inevitably hinders the countryside. However, in well-prepared anti-Japanese base areas, in addition to mobilizing all the manpower to quickly drive the Japanese away, the farmers have already been mobilized to grow more labor-saving organizations and to harvest grains that have a slightly flexible season, such as corn, sorghum, buckwheat, and wheat (autumn-planted wheat). Especially near the routes that the Japanese may attack, and in the mountains, wasteland reclamation and afforestation are being carried out more extensively. On the plains, agricultural water conservancy is being built very calmly. For example, in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, three short canals have been opened in Fuping, and one has been opened in Tangxian. Each canal can irrigate five or six qing of land. In the areas along the Fen River in northwestern Shanxi and western Shanxi, nine short canals have also been opened. In addition, in richer areas in the occupied areas, food is being controlled, and the masses are being educated to give the surplus food to the guerrillas in response to the Japanese blockade. In a few border areas, because the local area is poor, transportation is inconvenient, and there are many stationed troops, it is difficult to supply military food. However, these places where large armies are stationed cannot be connected with the rear and rely on supplies from the rear. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>England and Turkey to Conclude Long-Term Mutual Assistance Agreement to jointly resist the Mediterranean war of aggression. Negotiations between France and Turkey are nearing completion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 12th] When Prime Minister Sadarn announced to the National Assembly today that England and Turkey had concluded an agreement, all the members cheered repeatedly and the entire house enthusiastically supported the agreement. Sadarn listed the cordial friendship and sincere cooperation between England, Turkey and other peace-loving countries.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 13th] The Turkish Foreign Minister announced in the parliament yesterday the process of concluding the agreement between England and Turkey, and said that if the two countries encounter a war in the Mediterranean, they must provide mutual assistance, but the detailed conditions are still under discussion and will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British and Turkish governments are still continuing to negotiate, and both sides have made it clear that their opinions are completely consistent and no different from the past. The two governments will sign a long-term mutual assistance agreement to seek mutual national security. Before the agreement is signed, the two governments declared that if acts of aggression cause war in the Mediterranean, the two countries will cooperate and do their best to provide assistance. This statement is not directed at any one country, but is intended to ensure that England and Turkey provide mutual assistance when necessary. The two governments believe that some matters need to be further clarified and are currently under consideration. The two governments also believe that the security of the Balkans must be sought and are currently discussing together to achieve this goal as soon as possible. However, the two governments may still conclude agreements with other countries to consolidate peace. Attlee, the leader of the Labor opposition party, expressed satisfaction with Chamberlain's statement and asked whether the two countries would hold staff talks after the agreement was concluded. Chamberlain replied that he did not think this could be discussed before the agreement was concluded. Subsequently, Labor Party member Henderson asked whether the two countries had decided to allow troops to enter the Black Sea so that British fleets could enter the Black Sea to assist Romania if they were attacked by Germany. Chamberlain replied that his statement did not mention detailed regulations. All parties in the House of Commons expressed satisfaction with Chamberlain's statement on British-Turkish relations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 12th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain confirmed in the House of Commons today the rumor that England and Turkey had agreed to sign a mutual assistance agreement. The two countries had signed a temporary agreement that England and Turkey should provide mutual assistance when a war in the Mediterranean is caused by foreign aggression. This is to prevent attacks from Italy. As for the long-term mutual assistance agreement being planned, the purpose is to make Turkey a member of the anti-aggression front. Turkey guarantees to cooperate in preventing German and Italian aggression, and Britain also assists Turkey in completing its implementation and guarantee. However, it is expected that Turkey will not want to sign a broad agreement until Britain and the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance pact, because it believes that Soviet assistance is necessary for the defense of the Balkans, Poland, and the Baltic countries. Once the British-Soviet mutual assistance agreement is established, Turkey will assist Eastern European countries and allow British ships to enter the Black Sea to assist Romania.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Chamberlain's statement on Turkey was unanimously and warmly welcomed here. As for the French statement, because the negotiations between France and Turkey involve the Mediterranean, a small part still needs to be studied, but it is not difficult to resolve. Therefore, the French statement will also be published soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] All newspapers here unanimously reported this morning that France is likely to cede the Sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey as a basis for the signing of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and France. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Times" said that after only a few points have been discussed, the matter of ceding land can be decided. The political correspondent of the "Daily Mail" said that an agreement on this matter may be decided in the middle of next week. The "Daily Herald" is more cautious, only saying that the Sanjak problem can be finally resolved, but the newspaper did not reveal its nature. The newspaper also said that this problem may be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council for approval next week. The "News Chronicle" said that the Paris correspondent reported the matter. The "Times" editorial said that the Sanjak should be incorporated into Turkey this year. This method can remove the final obstacle to the establishment of an agreement between Turkey and France and incorporate it into the political track of signing a mutual assistance agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Piraeus, 12th] British and French authorities are constantly conducting experiments to improve air defense in the eastern Mediterranean. During an air defense exercise last night, the lights here were completely turned off. The Palestinian government is also making various air defense preparations, and is separately studying the problems of evacuating densely populated areas and protecting buildings.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation Between Germany and Poland; Nazi Party Disturbances in Kienia; Poland Sends Additional Artillery to Increase Defenses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Kienia, 13th] Today, when the Polish people here celebrated the anniversary of the birth of their national father, General Pilsudski, a group of Nazis rioted in the streets, destroying Polish restaurants and newspaper offices, and throwing stones at portraits of Pilsudski. When this incident occurred, the Senate here, which was manipulated by the Nazis, was apologizing to the Polish authorities for the bombing of the Polish customs office and the sniper attack on the Polish stationmaster. In order to avoid further deterioration of the situation, the Polish authorities in Danzig canceled the commemorative meeting originally scheduled for tonight because the Danzig police refused to protect it.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 11th] The Polish authorities have recently sent two additional artillery units to increase the defense of Kienia, ten miles from Danzig. The official explanation is that "in view of the international situation, the Polish people in the area have been greatly disturbed, which is why they are stabilizing people's hearts."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 12th] Political figures here denied the rumor that Japan was mediating the dispute between Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Strict Border Defenses in Danzig</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 12th] The Polish authorities have now begun to arrest members of the German minority in Upper Silesia, southern Poland. There have been many cases of those arrested for minor offenses being sentenced to weeks of imprisonment. The crimes they committed were no more than listening to foreign broadcasts or spreading alarming news. Some were even publicly rumored to have had their homes destroyed by the Polish people. This is regarded as spreading alarming news and is punishable by short-term imprisonment. In recent days, in the Katowice mining area and other parts of Upper Silesia, a large number of German miners and employees have been suddenly fired. In the Katowice area alone, hundreds of people have received notices of dismissal in recent days. The reason given by the person in charge is that it is a necessary step for restructuring work.</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 12th] The Chairman of the Danzig Municipal Senate, Greiser, gave a speech at a reception for German labor leaders, explaining the attitude of the Danzig government towards the international situation. He said, "Our wisdom will not be lost because of the alarmist talk in foreign newspapers and the mobilization of large armies on the border. Our fate will be in the hands of the German leader Hitler. The problem of Germans in Eastern Europe will be resolved sooner or later, and our fate will be decided at the same time. Although the borders of the Free City of Danzig are heavily guarded, Danzig will still maintain its customary calmness."</p>
<p>[Danzig, 12th] The Danzig Free City Senate was prepared to protest to Poland. It is said that the reason for the protest was that two Danzig people were shot last night when they crossed the Danzig Polish border bridge because they refused to answer the Polish army's slogan.</p>
<p>Goebbels Attacks Polish Policies</p>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th] After German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently wrote an article entitled "Where is Poland Going?", he wrote an article this morning attacking Poland's current policies, entitled "The Road of Poland with Bayonets." This article will appear in this morning's organ of the National Socialist Party and the People's Observer. Goebbels said that the majority of the residents of Danzig are Germans, and other issues such as Poland's rights are secondary. The German leader's proposal on the Danzig and Corridor issues is enough to show that Germany does not want to cut off Poland's sea route, but the Polish press has fiercely attacked it and aroused Polish so-called patriots to hate German expatriates in Poland. If the Polish government is determined, it is not difficult to restrain these events. In order to eliminate the seriousness of the situation, Germany will never incite public sentiment and make counter-German regulations to Polish public opinion that have reached the point of unbearable. All German citizens should ask themselves whether Polish expatriates in Germany have been abused by Germans, whether they have been scolded or insulted the Polish leader and other important figures. Also, German courts have never made unfair judgments against Polish expatriates. Therefore, the Polish people mistakenly believe that Germany is a cowardly country. Moreover, recently, Polish newspapers even said that Poland had once defeated Germany and would fight near Berlin in the future. Although it is Poland's freedom to seek its own interests, it has nothing to do with us to answer with bayonets to lead the way. We only hope that the road led is not to change Poland's territory. If it is said that this road does not end even if it reaches outside Berlin, then we cannot but use bayonets as defense, because German territory must not be destroyed by others. Now we are prepared and waiting for the evolution of the situation.</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in Daladier</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] French leader Daladier won the Chamber of Deputies' confidence in his handling of diplomatic events today with 375 votes against 230.</p>
<h3>U.S. Department of the Army Announces Enhancement of Air and Sea Defenses; Coastal Artillery Unit to be Reorganized on July 1; Leahy Appointed Governor of Puerto Rico</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Department of the Army announced that the coastal artillery unit will be reorganized on July 1 to enhance air and sea defenses. It is said that personnel from the army's administrative side will be transferred to combat personnel, which can increase the artillery unit by 18 teams. If six of them are equipped with modern mobile anti-aircraft guns that have already been manufactured, the regular army's air defense force can be increased by 83 percent. Some artillery units will be equipped with long-range heavy artillery to enhance the defense of the Atlantic and Pacific sea lanes, and four teams will be stationed in New York.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 12th] About three U.S. battleships and auxiliary ships arrived in Pacific ports today. The country's fleet deployment (i.e., transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific) is now complete.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] General Leahy, Director of Naval Tactics, will soon retire. President Roosevelt has ordered him to be the Governor of Puerto Rico to replace General Winship.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Covenant: The Problem of Amendment Will Be Discussed at the Regular Meeting of the Administrative Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] Certain diplomatic figures here recently declared that the League of Nations Administrative Council may discuss the amendment of the Covenant at its current regular meeting. This proposal was initiated by the Soviet Union or one of the Balkan countries, and supported by Turkey. The current plan is to divide the member states of the League of Nations into two categories: active and ordinary. The former must accept mutual assistance obligations, while the latter does not. British political figures recently commented that this plan, although not as good as the general collective security system advocated by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, is better than the establishment of an agreement between England, France, and the Soviet Union to implement a partial collective security system and is highly approved by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Military Conflict Between Greece and Bulgaria; News from Budapest</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 15th] It is reported that a conflict occurred between the Greek and Bulgarian border guards on the 5th. Initially, six Bulgarian defense forces attacked a Greek patrol team, killing a Greek officer and three soldiers on the spot, and wounding five soldiers. It is reported that after the Greek army received reinforcements, it counterattacked, killing ten Bulgarian soldiers and wounding nine.</p>

<h3>Close Relations Between Lithuania and Poland; Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lithuanian Capital, 12th] Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Rashtikis returned here from Poland today. It is expected that the political and military cooperation between Poland and Lithuania will become closer due to General Rashtikis's visit to Warsaw. However, no special agreement was signed during his trip. However, the fact that Poland has fully agreed with Lithuania's attitude towards Eastern European issues is highly valued here.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the United States Broadcasts Speech: The Ocean is Not Enough to Separate the Relations Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] The British Pavilion at the World's Fair was opened today by British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay. The monument is inscribed with the words "This pavilion commemorates the permanent peace and friendship between the people of the United States and Britain." The British Ambassador broadcast to the world, "The United States is a happy land for us to visit. Those we come into contact with here are all friends with the same interests and ideals." He also hopes that the British Pavilion will show that the ocean is not enough to separate the two countries, but is just enough to connect them.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of British King's Coronation; Escorting Warships Fire Salutes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Today is the anniversary of the British King's coronation. When the royal Canadian special ship "Queen of Australia" was sailing through heavy fog and ice floes, the three cruisers accompanying it fired 21 salutes as a tribute.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] A Reuters special correspondent on the "Queen of Australia" reported that the heavy fog suddenly cleared this evening, but ice floes were gathered on both sides of the special ship. The King and Queen stood on the deck, skipping over the special ship sailing between the white training. The sunset reflected, and the scenery was excellent, but after an hour, the mist fell again and no figures could be seen.</p>
<h3>Possibilities for Post-War Economic Construction (Continued from Page 3)</h3>
<p>B. Establishing Small-Scale Production Enterprises: Establishing various types of production enterprises in rural areas. Due to the lack of machinery, capital, and technical personnel, as well as limitations on raw materials, consumption, and transportation, only small-capital, small-scale enterprises are possible. In fact, even small industries are targeted by the [Japanese] invaders. Therefore, factory sites must be selected in remote areas or mountainous regions where raw materials are not concentrated and transportation is difficult, or on plains near the [Japanese] occupied areas, adopting a system of dispersed production and centralized management. In nature, they are mostly government-run or jointly operated by government and private entities, and even the few private factories should be subject to government supervision.</p>
<p>Initial fundraising will be relatively difficult. Investing in production enterprises during wartime is perceived as a risk. Only after the military has secured the base areas to a sufficiently stable degree, and the government promulgates new factory laws guaranteeing shareholder dividends, coupled with explanations and persuasion by national salvation organizations, will even wealthy farmers slowly become active.</p>
<p>Small machines and handicraft tools are mostly borrowed from existing local sources and a portion brought from fallen cities, which are felt to be insufficient. In addition to making every effort to repair and improve them, it is necessary for the rear areas to find ways to supply them.</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of workers and technical personnel, workers' wages are higher than those of soldiers, and the salaries of technical personnel and specialists are two to three times higher than those of administrative officials. Besides training apprentices locally, it is hoped that technical personnel and specialists working in the rear areas can be allocated to the [Liberated] rear areas.</p>
<p>C. Self-Sufficiency in Military Supplies and Daily Necessities: Various anti-Japanese base areas surrounded by the [Japanese] inevitably face difficulties in transporting many special products and producing certain essential goods. However, these difficulties are easily overcome. This is because of the self-sufficient system passed down in Chinese agricultural society. Although it has been undermined by capitalist imperialism, it is still easy to restore. In the plain production areas, most land has been converted to planting miscellaneous grains since last year, and in some areas, the cultivation of indigo, which was common decades ago, has been restored. Following the government's instructions, a path of production control has been naturally embarked upon. As for the various resources for military production, such as the production of coal, iron, sulfur, and niter, they are mostly located in the mountainous areas of the base areas. Some base areas, such as Jin Southeast, have reserves estimated to be sufficient for four years of supply. Moreover, the damaged bismuth rails from the edges of various base areas are the best raw materials. The issue of salt seems to be more serious, but in reality, the common people have their own methods. Inland, they rely on rock salt, well salt, and pond salt. Coastal provinces rely on Changlu salt, Qing salt, and Huai salt, as well as the niter produced locally. After the salt fields fell into [Japanese] hands, efforts to seize salt were immediately launched. The people have long been trained in the ability to smuggle salt. Now, with the encouragement of the government and the assistance of the military, the results are quite considerable. What needs to be stated is that the [Japanese] blockade lines are not impenetrable. Many sections can be freely traversed, and we will not sit idly by and be besieged.</p>
<p>IV. Economic Construction in Jin Southeast in the Past Six Months</p>
<p>The Jin Southeast Anti-Japanese Base Area includes 25 counties in Shanxi Province south of the Zhengtai Railway and east of the Tongpu Railway. It has an excellent terrain, the most battle-hardened troops, a relatively enlightened government, and the widespread development of mass salvation organizations. The great power of the combined military, political, and civilian efforts, after crushing the [Japanese] nine-pronged offensive in March last year, has deterred the [Japanese] from directly confronting this base area again. Although they are constantly seeking opportunities to encircle and attack Jin Southeast, the base area is also preparing to repel the [Japanese] offensive and, in order to further consolidate and strengthen its resilience, began economic construction in the base area in September last year. The necessity and possibility of economic construction have been discussed earlier. The reporter will briefly report on the achievements of the construction:</p>
<p>In Shanxi, there are three densely populated areas: the Taiyuan Basin, the Jin Southwest Triangle, and the Changzhi-Jincheng area. Changzhi, Changzi, Tunliu, Xiangyuan, Lucheng, and Qin County are located within a basin, densely populated and rich in resources, making it an ideal base area. The coal and iron produced in Jincheng and Changzhi are comparable to Kouquan in northern Shanxi and Yangquan in eastern Shanxi, with iron reserves sufficient for four years. The millet produced in Changzhi and Tunliu is sufficient for three years in a good harvest. Other products such as liquor and vinegar are also famous. The population of Changzhi County is now over 30,000, making it the largest city in North China in our hands and the military, political, and cultural center of North China. The reason for this achievement, besides other factors, is the sustainability of the economy, which is the main reason. In addition to wasteland reclamation and ensuring food supply, the most important aspects of economic construction are the establishment of various industrial sectors:</p>
<p>I. Military Industry: Almost every county has a small-scale arsenal, and the production capacity is sufficient. Other factories, such as textile mills, sewing workshops, military shoe factories, leather factories, and paper mills, total no less than 200. Hemp is being improved to facilitate printing. Jixian has improved textile machines that can produce 60 to 70 bolts of cloth per day.</p>
<p>II. Self-Sufficiency in Daily Necessities: Production cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and production-consumption cooperatives, as well as work-relief factories, are very common. Production-sales cooperatives have been established in almost every county and village. The capital of village production-sales cooperatives is mostly over 500 yuan, the capital of district production-sales cooperatives is over 2,000 yuan, and the capital of county production-sales cooperatives is over 6,000 yuan. The capital of county production-sales cooperatives in Changzhi, Changzi, and Jincheng has reached over 10,000 yuan. This capital is mostly collected from farmers, with a small amount of government subsidies. In addition, loan offices are established in each county, district, or village using funds from confiscated and confiscated traitor properties. The funds of county loan offices are mostly over 6,000 yuan. The loan office funds in Changzhi, Jincheng, Gaoping, and Yangcheng counties are currently over 10,000 yuan. With guarantees from mass salvation organizations, low-interest or interest-free loans are provided to poor farmers or small business owners to encourage the transportation of scarce essential goods from neighboring areas, such as purchasing cotton, firearms, and salt. In addition, there are considerable achievements in transportation control, production control, export blockade, increased taxation, resisting counterfeit money, and eliminating counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>The above measures are all progressing rapidly, so only a brief overview can be provided. Detailed statistics are not yet available. Even if they were available, they would not be publicly disclosed. However, we can understand the situation by looking at the number of workers engaged in economic construction. The population of the 25 counties in Jin Southeast is slightly over 3 million, and the current number of workers is no less than 200,000. The membership of the National Salvation Association alone has reached 700,000. Adding their family members (who have separately joined women's salvation and children's salvation organizations), the proportion of the total population is considerable.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Commemorating Mother's Day!</h3>
<p>Today, the second Sunday in May, is Mother's Day, which has long been established in various countries!</p>
<p>Today, when the flames of war of fascist aggressors have ignited or threaten the entire China and the world, our commemoration of Mother's Day has special and significant meaning!</p>
<p>Who among us does not have a mother? Who among us has not enjoyed the great love of a mother?</p>
<p>Our mothers, for the sake of great love, have endured countless hardships! Until terrible wrinkles creep onto their foreheads and hands, they still fearlessly face all pain for the sake of their children's lives and happiness!</p>
<p>Our Chinese mothers today, for the independence, freedom, and happiness of China, have sacrificed their husbands and sons. They have even endured unimaginable humiliation and slaughter by [Japanese] and traitors!</p>
<p>Our mothers today are playing out a great drama of defending the Chinese nation and defending human culture. Yet they believe that unity is still lacking, and they do not receive any sympathy, comfort, or respect! Think about it! Children of the world, children of China, shouldn't we be ashamed?</p>
<p>Greeting this great Mother's Day, from today onwards, we must value the great significance of the efforts of mothers today! We must not only give them sympathy, comfort, and gifts, but we must also launch mass movements to comfort the families of soldiers fighting at the front! To comfort the mothers who are exiled in various places! To educate and organize the vast numbers of working women! To promote the movement of Chinese mothers to protect and nurture the next generation! What is particularly important is that we must also rescue the hundreds of millions of mothers who are suffering from humiliation, starvation, cold, and death under the guns, axes, ropes, and all the horrors of the [Japanese] and traitors!</p>
<p>Greeting this great Mother's Day, we also hope that enlightened mothers and mothers with capital will contribute more! You must respond to the Central Government's National Spiritual Mobilization and implementation measures, practice frugality, diligence, and hygiene in the family and among relatives and friends! No more going to dance halls, indulging in opium and entertainment, neglecting household affairs, and ignoring the lives of your children! You must encourage your husbands and children to have a tense, serious, lively, and united spirit! You must encourage your husbands and children to take responsibility for saving the country and the nation! You must expand your maternal love to love the country and the nation, to care for the tens of millions of refugees and soldiers! You must also detest the traitors' advocacy of peace and anti-communism, because this is helping the [Japanese] destroy China! Know that if the country and the nation do not gain independence and freedom for one day, then the interests of any family will not be guaranteed for one day!</p>
<p>I remember a famous female leader once said in an article "Chinese Women and Families": If Chinese women do not value luxury, then Chinese officials will never be corrupt; if Chinese women strive for the country, then Chinese men will definitely be able to defeat the [Japanese] (the general idea is like this). We sincerely hope that Chinese mothers will think about the great significance of these words!</p>
<p>We wish the Chinese mothers of the great era all the best!</p>

<h3>Constructing a Modern New City: Hong Kong Government Forms Urban Design Committee to Advance Municipal Construction in Hong Kong, Plans Divided into Four Departments: Transportation, Construction, and Industry, Draft Bill Already Prepared, Awaiting Legislative Council Approval Before Implementation</h3>
<p>Urban construction in Hong Kong is mostly based on old designs, with buildings piled on top of each other and narrow, uneven streets. In terms of the entire Hong Kong, it is still far from the ideal of a modern city. The Hong Kong authorities, recognizing the need to improve urban construction, have appointed an Urban Design Committee to be responsible for designing the construction of new urban areas.

<h3>Women's Joint Council Suddenly Ordered to Dissolve, Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Dissolution, Funds Raised Donated to Manufacture Short Shirts and Pants</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Joint Council, after being recently ordered by the Hong Kong government to cease its organization, held a meeting at the Chinese Women's Association at 7:30 pm the night before yesterday in order to comply with the laws of the host country to discuss the issue of dissolution. Representatives from various women's circles attended the meeting. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely tense, and they all expressed regret over the suspension of the organization, believing that the purpose of the council was purely for relief work for wounded soldiers and refugees, and there was no other meaning behind it. After discussion, the representatives decided to dissolve the council immediately, and at the same time resolved to donate the sum of 1,023 yuan, which the council had previously earned from the drama performed by the China Travel Troupe at the Queen's Theatre, less expenses, together with 100 yuan donated by the Chinese Women's Association, to the Hong Kong Office of the Women's New Life Movement to manufacture short shirts and pants and send them to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3>High Rents and Poor Business, Stalls in New Central Market Mostly Losing Money, Rents Two to Five Times Higher Than Before, More Than Ten Stalls Preparing to Close Down After a Month</h3>
<p>The Central Market in Hong Kong has not been open for long, but the business of the stalls in the market has been extremely weak. Most of them are losing money every day, and some stalls are preparing to close down and return the lease. The reporter went to investigate yesterday and visited Mr. Tot, Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, who is responsible for management, to inquire about his opinion on this situation. It is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Business Conditions: Heavy Losses</p>
<p>According to the vendors in the market, they all regret setting the rough amount too high when bidding for the stalls. Moreover, even now, some of the stalls have not been opened, and some have been closed due to excessive losses. Among the beef and mutton stalls, 14 are preparing to return the lease after two months (because it is stipulated that the rent must be paid two months in advance). One vegetable stall closed down three days after opening. The biggest reason for this is that the rent is too high, and business is very slow during the day, so they have to sacrifice two months' rent to avoid excessive losses. Currently, the rent value of the stalls in the Central Market is about two to five times higher than in the past on average. This excessive price is contrary to economic principles. According to the owner of a pig stall with a monthly rent of 688 yuan and 50 cents, although his rent value is not too high, his daily business losses have reached about 6 yuan. Another meat stall with a rent value of 150 yuan closed down four days after opening. The business of other stalls is also not good, and most of them blame the authorities for allowing shops on nearby streets to sell fresh fruits, which has affected the business of the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Tot Expressed Disbelief</p>
<p>The reporter also visited Mr. Tot, Chairman of the Health Bureau. He claimed that he has not received any reports regarding the poor business in the Central Market and the closure of some stalls, and that this matter is not credible, because the market regulations stipulate that all stalls must pay two months' rent in advance. They have already paid the rent and are giving up their rights to enjoy it and not doing business. Furthermore, it is stipulated that any stall that returns the lease must give one month's notice in advance to facilitate the procedures. However, according to the report of Chairman Tot at the Municipal Health Bureau meeting held on Tuesday, the new market has a total rental value of 348,315 yuan and 60 cents. The total construction cost of the market is only 800,000 yuan. Such a high rental value exceeds economic principles. Whether it affects the market business or raises prices has not yet been confirmed. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the people in the stalls in the Central Market, due to the new opening, do not dare to raise prices, and even lower prices to seek business improvement and development.</p>
<h3>Early Summer in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Yu Lang</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>The weather is still cool, but the bare legs and arms of women, revealed through the loose weave of silk gauze, have already begun to tell us—summer is here.</p>
<p>Summer is here, women are liberated from their fur coats; thin and short summer dresses display parts of their bodies; the streets are filled with vibrant colors and a light, lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The department store windows are displaying light-colored outer clothing fabrics, white handbags, white, light gray, light white high heels… everything, everything, is supplying women to adorn themselves for the early summer, early summer! This is a season for women.</p>
<p>Of course, men's perception of the weather is not much slower, "Changing seasons, changing seasons," white "Saxons," light-colored suits, pale yellow "Pompadours"... replacing their wool suits.</p>
<p>"Changing seasons, changing seasons," forgive me, let me send you a reminder—</p>
<p>Newspapers report that goods from East * * , especially clothing fabrics, are increasing in imports; * -made goods have arrived in large quantities and begun to dump prices. What should you do when "changing seasons"?</p>
<p>The second point is: summer is coming, you are busy "changing seasons," and the anti-Japanese soldiers shedding blood on the front lines also need to change seasons: what they need to change is not "Saxons," suits, or "Pompadours,"… but truly short clothes worth less than a dollar a set. The short clothing donation movement is underway. When you "change seasons," will you think of changing seasons for the soldiers shedding blood on the front lines?</p>
<p>Hong Kong, an island country, with its deep blue sea water, golden sandy beaches, is most lovable in summer. Many swimming pools have already opened, the swimming season has arrived, and the swimming pools are becoming more lively day by day.</p>
<p>Truly, "cool and refreshing water," after a swim, "one can have ice cream, pastries, sandwiches... and other Western-style delicacies. If you want to escape the heat or escape the heat and the summer, why not live in Repulse Bay? Wealthy people can also build private swimming pools on the Repulse Bay beach!</p>
<p>In anticipation of the swimming season, presidential ships and queen ships have transported large quantities of 1939 or 1940 swimming suits from foreign countries, colorful, made of silk, cotton, yarn, wool, revealing the entire back and belly, filling the department stores.</p>
<p>For the past few years, manufacturers of swimming suits have focused on reducing yarn and increasing the exposed parts of the body, from exposing thighs to exposing backs, exposing bellies… continuing until many people thought it would lead to complete exposure without swimming suits; but manufacturers who want to do business will not be so foolish. This year, instead of working on the "exposure" aspect, they are working on the "color" aspect, with various patterns, designs, mixed colors, gold and silver, all available. Of course, the prices are not cheap, the cheapest costing more than ten dollars, and the more elaborate ones costing twenty or thirty dollars, or even seventy or eighty dollars!</p>
<p>This year, Hong Kong swimming pools will definitely be more lively, and the girls wearing colorful new swimming suits will definitely be more beautiful; beauty, dressing up beautifully, this is the greatness of urban women!</p>
<p>Early summer is here, early summer brings you beauty, joy, but it also brings you a bit of terror—the terrible summer epidemic of cholera is also coming fiercely. According to the health authorities, many cases have already been discovered, and this year we must start taking precautions early.</p>
<p>The distribution of ice cream and cold drinks will be restricted, but you don't have to worry about not having ice cream to eat. A certain ice cream company announced that it made a profit of more than one hundred thousand yuan last year. Wasn't cholera very prevalent last year?</p>
<p>Cholera will naturally be a serious problem this year. You see, the population has increased by more than 300,000, and the standard of living is getting higher day by day. How can the poor talk about hygiene?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is only those wearing black sunglasses who can see clearly (?)—In the sun, many poor people are washing clothes in mountain streams and drinking water with their hands. There are also often groups of women and children drinking cold water from street taps.</p>
<p>Under the evil pressure of rent increases, those who used to live on the first floor now live in one room, and those who lived in one room now live in a bed space? Those who lived in bed spaces end up on the streets. As the weather gets warmer, the streets and alleys are filled with people: there are men, women, old women, and also nursing children. Dirty clothes are piled up on the side of the ditch, and they eat leftover food from the previous night in a bowl on a brick board. The children eat rotten fruit picked up in front of the fruit stalls… In such a life, with the arrival of cholera, aren't they heading to the front lines of death?</p>
<p>However, do not ignore that cholera is a very contagious disease. Cholera does not recognize the rich and the poor. If the poor get cholera, the rich will also be infected. In order to save themselves, the rich should also help the poor improve their lives and prevent it early.</p>
<p>Early summer is a naughty child, he brings people many beautiful summer clothes, swimming girls, and also brings many homeless people sleeping on the streets.</p>
<p>He gives people ice cream, swimming, waltzes, … and also brings people the terrible cholera.</p>
<p>Exile for Work</p>
<h3>Shanghai Refugee Student Work Team Hosted a Report to All Sectors Yesterday, Now Planning to Go to Guilin to Continue Working Hard, Hoping to Provide Spiritual and Material Assistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Student Work Team held a meeting in Shanghai last month. Because of holding the National Spiritual Mobilization and hanging the national flag, they were arrested by the French Concession as terrorists and ordered to leave the country. Those who were forced to leave the country include Shen Ziren, Wu Wenpu, Dongfang Hun, Zha Yunqing, Tian Peifang, Sun Zhibing, Shen Heshi, Cao Houchu, Yang Jie (above males), Yang Yang, Huang Xia Hua, Lu Qing, Gao Jing (above females), a group of thirteen people, recently took a ship to Hong Kong, planning to transfer to Guilin Province to engage in salvation work. However, all members of the team, in order to look at the road ahead, retain life, and hastily leave Shanghai, did not carry money. In addition to the Yanlian Association and the Bingzai Association each donating HK$100 upon arrival in Hong Kong, and the Aberdeen Teachers' Association donating HK$6, the travel expenses to Guilin are still huge. Therefore, the team yesterday afternoon, held a meeting at the Bingzai Association, inviting all sectors and representatives of overseas Chinese to report on this forced exodus from Shanghai due to work, and to ask for assistance from all sectors to depart for Guilin.</p>
<p>Hope for Spiritual and Material Assistance</p>
<p>The meeting was opened by Shen Ziren, chairman of the team, who briefly said that he was very grateful to everyone for taking the time out of their busy schedules to participate in the team's reception today. The reason why we were forced to leave Shanghai was entirely due to our efforts for the future of the motherland. Therefore, disregarding everything, we privately left our beloved families and fled to Hong Kong. This sadness has long disappeared in excitement. Although we have left our beloved hometown, we still feel very excited. The first point to be said today is to report our past work in Shanghai and our organization, so that everyone can know and give us greater sympathy. The second point is how we will carry out our work in the future. The third point is to realize our ideals and go to Guilin to do our work. At the same time, we hope that everyone will give us spiritual and material assistance. Then, Wu Wenyang reported on the situation of working in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Work in the Past Four Periods</p>
<p>Briefly said that in the past, our work can be roughly divided into four periods. The first period was after the July 7th Anti-Japanese War broke out. The comrades participated in the Shanghai Youth Summer Rural Service Corps to work in the countryside, and also participated in the Shanghai Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Aviation Exhibition Propaganda Team, responsible for propaganda work, etc. After the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, our work entered the second period, actively participating in the Anti-Japanese War. Also, because of the different schools, we participated in various organizations. Like the Shanghai Garrison Allied Team, we also participated in the Shanghai Student Battlefield Service Corps, the Shanghai Student Salvation Association, the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps, and various frontline and rear work of the wounded soldiers' hospitals and refugee relief associations. After more than three months of work, the National Army moved west and withdrew from Shanghai. Later, our work entered a new period. In addition to some familiar comrades leaving Shanghai with the army, many others stayed in Shanghai for environmental reasons and began to organize the Shanghai Refugee Student Team, using this spirit to continue working in various anti-Japanese areas. After the first successful departure, five teams were organized in succession, mobilizing more than 300 people. When the sixth team was about to depart, because the power of the × people in Shanghai was increasing day by day, our collective actions were noticed and the Concession authorities were forced and instigated by the × people's Military Police Command to arrest all our comrades from the departing ships one by one. Most of them were disbanded, and the team leader, Comrade Shen, was driven to Shantou. However, in this harsh environment, we changed the way we worked and entered the fourth period, which can also be said to be our most difficult period.</p>
<p>Hope for Guidance and Supervision from All Parties</p>
<p>During this period, we planned commemorative meetings on every anniversary day as an opportunity for our activities, and we used ghostly guerrilla methods to distribute leaflets and slogans in every bustling entertainment venue on last year's "July 7th", "August 13th", and "September 18th" anniversaries, which had a great effect. Especially on "August 13th", Comrade Yang was arrested by the ×× Military Police Command for his work, and suffered very severe × ×. Team leader Comrade Shen, after arriving in Shantou, received the sympathy and assistance of Mr. Zhou You, a director of the ×× Support Association, and returned to Shanghai to work, and joined the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union. On March 28, the anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Puppet Municipal Government, Comrade Shen was ordered to mobilize more than 3,000 dockworkers to swear never to cooperate with the × people, and the emotions were very enthusiastic. Until the near-upper month, on the 20th, due to the Shanghai City Industry and Commerce community publicizing spiritual mobilization, an affair took place because of the hanging of the national flag. Three of our comrades were arrested, and we received a final report from the × people's side. Under the environment of having to leave, we abandoned our families and secretly left Shanghai in a rush of time. "The past work is roughly like this. Regarding the present," because we left in a hurry, our poor economic strength, except for the boat tickets, the rest was finished in Hong Kong in less than three days. Although life is very hard now, we only feel happy in spirit. As for the future, we will return to the motherland to help the army and work with the army. We are willing to find and do all the work that the army needs to do, or help the local government do civilian work, so that our army and people can be united. We are determined to do the most difficult and hardest work that others are unwilling to do in order to obtain our supreme and glorious price. Our report is over. We hope that everyone can sympathize with us, help us, and hope that all parties will give us unreserved guidance and supervision. Then the guests gave speeches, and the team answered questions before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Will Seek a Proper Solution to the Kowloon Walled City Pig Farming Problem, The Commissioner of Health Surveyed Ngau Chi Wan Yesterday, Planning to Move the Pig Farms Near the Urban Area to the Mountainside</h3>
<p>The incident of banning the residents of Ngau Chi Wan, Kowloon City from raising pigs and livestock has been repeatedly petitioned to the Chinese Affairs Secretary by the local residents, earnestly requesting the transfer to the Hong Kong government and the municipal health authorities, calling for the cancellation of the ban, so that the livelihoods of thousands of local farming households will not be trapped in a tragic situation. This matter has been going on for many months. The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to carefully consider and properly handle the matter, have not yet resolved it. However, thousands of local residents have signed their names, because in this situation, the impact on their daily lives is not small. Recently, the local gentlemen convened a meeting of representatives of residents and farming households to discuss appealing to the authorities again, so as to resolve the matter and allow the local farming households to avoid being at a loss.</p>
<p>Petitions to the Authorities, Earnest Statements</p>
<p>After several consultations, it was decided to hire a lawyer to be responsible for contacting the Chinese Affairs Secretary and the municipal health authorities, requesting that on the one hand, they would again jointly submit a petition to the authorities, earnestly stating the detailed explanation of the current living conditions of the local residents raising livestock. If they obeyed the order to move to a quiet area in the New Territories to continue raising pigs and livestock, the situation would be extremely difficult. Because thousands of local residents engaged in livestock farming have little or no huge capital, and the raw materials for daily livestock pig livestock are all personally obtained from the waste water from the residents' buildings in the Peninsula and Hong Kong, and the rotten vegetables from the vegetable market. Once they move to the New Territories, which is far from the urban area, it will be extremely difficult to obtain all the waste water and rotten vegetables, and the construction of all the moved wooden huts will require money. Judging from the current capabilities of the Kowloon farming households, it is impossible to bear the burden.</p>
<p>Authorities Plan, Proper Solution</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter went to interview Mr. Yang, the representative of the Kowloon City farming households, who said that after the joint petition was submitted by the farming households, the Hong Kong government authorities have expressed their determination to seek a proper solution under the principle of not increasing the difficulties of the local farming households, so as to carry out the plan to expand Kowloon City. However, it is necessary to beautify the city appearance and strictly maintain the health and hygiene of the general buildings and residents, so it is necessary to consider it in detail, but also take into account the difficult situation of the general farming households. Therefore, moving to the New Territories seems to be forbidden by the environment, but if it is not properly managed, it will not be without considerable obstacles to the city appearance and the health of the local residents. The only solution is to move the pig farming wooden houses near the buildings in the Kowloon City area to a more remote area near the mountainside of Saam Shing Wan, which is considered suitable for the south side and is also considered to be easily feasible.</p>
<p>Health Personnel Go to Survey</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is currently planning this stable measure. Yesterday, light personnel were sent to survey the mountainous area near Ngau Chi Wan to investigate the land situation in that area and give it detailed consideration as to whether it can be conveniently implemented. As for the opinions of the general farming households, they believe that although it is easier to obtain various feeds when raising pigs and livestock near the urban area, the authorities must comply with the authorities' instructions in order to maintain the hygiene of the local residents and beautify the city appearance, and move to Ngau Chi Wan near the mountainside. Although it is slightly farther from the urban area and it takes a considerable amount of time to travel back and forth, it is far better than moving to the New Territories. If the authorities decide this way, the general farming households will be happy to comply.) It also said that regarding the resolution of this matter, the authorities will convene a meeting of local gentlemen and representatives of farming households in the coming days to discuss the matter in detail. It is expected that the resolution of this matter will proceed smoothly in the future.</p>
<h3>Eliminate the Spread of Seasonal Diseases, Strictly Ban Dirty Housing, Health Authorities Have Instructed Staff to Conduct Serious Investigations, Those Who Fail to Clean Up Within the Deadline Will Be Prosecuted and Punished</h3>
<p>The recent weather is erratic, with frequent changes between cold and hot, causing seasonal diseases to multiply and posing a great threat to the health of Hong Kong residents, and even causing some to lose their lives. Among them, the most harmful is tuberculosis, which has been spreading for a long time, and the recently developing smallpox and cholera (also known as cholera). The harm of cholera is especially frightening. Cases have been discovered continuously in recent days. The municipal health authorities, in order to strictly protect the lives and health of residents, have repeatedly issued announcements to the general public, advising them to be careful about their diet and properly adjust their personal hygiene. On the one hand, they advise the general public to go to various public hospitals and police stations to get injections.</p>
<p>Preventive cholera injections, and prepare to send staff door-to-door for injections when necessary, showing the health authorities' concern for the health of residents. According to sources, the health authorities are paying close attention to the gradual spread of cholera. In addition to the various appropriate preventive measures mentioned above, it is also recognized that the dirtiness and unhygienic conditions of general housing, especially the street food, lower-level restaurants, tea houses, and cafes, are especially important. In order to eliminate the threat of cholera and fully</p>
<p>protect the health of residents, it is necessary to strictly ban these unsanitary places. Recently, the Cleanliness Bureau personnel in various districts of Hong Kong Island and the Peninsula have been ordered to conduct serious investigations. After receiving orders, the Cleanliness Bureau personnel in various districts have been dispatched one after another to carry out investigations, paying more attention to residents' housing. If the setting of rooms and attics in the building is considered to hinder the air circulation in the building, they will be warned immediately and ordered to demolish and improve it within the specified time. Those who fail to comply within the deadline will be prosecuted and punished without leniency.</p>
<p>They are also specifically ordered to clean the kitchens, toilets (or night soil buckets), and bathrooms in the building at all times to meet hygiene principles. Recently, many buildings with dense populations in Central, Sheung Wan, and Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island, and Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Kwun Chung on the Peninsula have been investigated and warned by health personnel. This is because the population density in these areas is the highest in all districts. Each building often houses forty or fifty people. The beds in the building are stacked on top of each other. Regardless of the space under the stairs and</p>
<p>the connection to the building, they are all filled with residents. The large number of people and the lack of cleanliness fill the building with dirt, which has a great impact on the health of the residents. As for the middle and lower-level restaurants, tea houses, restaurants, ice cream parlors, herbal tea shops, and other public places in various districts, they are also investigated one by one, strictly requiring cleanliness and hygiene, and food must not be contaminated in any way, so as not to harm the citizens. The cleanliness of food stores on street shops and various stalls in "food streets" in various districts is especially monitored by cleanliness personnel. Those who still do not meet hygiene standards after repeated education and persuasion will have their licenses and stalls revoked. Recently, street vendors in Sham Shui Po and Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and other districts, because the weather has gradually become hot, have sold a lot of ice water and other cold drinks, and have now disappeared from view due to the crackdown by cleanliness personnel.</p>

<h3>Masses, Revolution, Historical Drama: Problems of Writing and Staging</h3>
<p>— Hu Chunbing</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Mass drama is a play where the masses are the masters. In ancient times, the masters of dramas were emperors, nobles, or semi-divine figures. After the medieval period, knights, wandering poets, and young ladies appreciated by the powerful and wealthy appeared on stage. The barber as the master of the drama was a pioneering record of modern drama because the petty bourgeoisie gradually rose at that time. Using a lively social collective, using the masses as the masters of the drama, is a modern and very modern matter. Thanks to the great poet Emile Verhaeren, his "Dawn" transformed previously anonymous hero soldiers into a collective with souls, with a common will, turning aggressive wars into bright wars. Romain Rolland's "July 14th" is a glorious epic of the French Revolution on stage. Tretyakov's "Roar China!" depicts the united struggle of a suffering nation. After the War of Resistance, "Defend Lugou Bridge" and "Huanghuagang" even more express and shout out the common will of the Chinese people who are unwilling to be slaves to resist aggression and build the nation.</p>
<p>Greek dramas were not without masses. However, the masses only served as a chorus. In their call and response with the protagonist, they praised the great power of fate. Sometimes, the masses represented fate, like eerie ghost shadows. The masses in Shakespeare's plays are merely followers and soldiers. They are used as decorations to show how great the master of the play is or to help create an atmosphere. They have no blood or flesh, like silhouettes. In Ibsen's and Rusi Huasui's plays, the masses only fulfill the role of villains, which is even less significant.</p>
<p>The awakening of the masses is a modern event, and the emergence of mass drama is an even more modern event. The performance of mass drama with blood and flesh in China is a modern experiment that began after the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The term "revolutionary drama" was created for convenience. In general, any action depicting the life of a society or an era is called a revolutionary drama. Revolutionary drama can be said to be "the drama of drama" because "there is no drama without struggle," and revolution is the most direct and greatest struggle. Furthermore, it does not necessarily have to write about the front lines of struggle or war. As long as it can meet the needs of the revolution and has rich revolutionary content, it can be called a revolutionary drama.</p>
<p>Revolutionary dramas usually have two sides: the revolutionary camp and the reactionary camp. The climax of the play must be a conflict or a fight. The revolutionary must have a typical character—an organizer, or a Raisonneur who speaks out the guiding theory. There are also those who are passionate but lack work experience, and even internal spies. Among the reactionary camps, there must be characters that can reflect the corruption, brutality, and inevitable targets of the revolution. In addition, there are people in the reactionary camp who sympathize with the revolution, or even revolutionaries who infiltrate the inside to do work. In short, any angle of social life that embodies a revolutionary action, or the causes and effects of a revolution, can be called a revolutionary drama.</p>
<p>The agitational dramas of the Soviet Union following the October Revolution and the propaganda dramas during the first phase of the Chinese National Revolution were the first phase of revolutionary dramas. Now, the content has been enriched, the scope has been expanded, the artistic level has been improved, and the theoretical image has been enhanced. The Soviet Union's Advanced Theater and the Chinese War of Resistance Drama under construction are the mature stages of revolutionary drama. In writing, it overcomes the shallow propaganda of slogans, the simplistic approach of killing and fighting, and overcomes all the clichés and similar problems. It makes revolutionary drama the most exquisite and visualized display of ideology, making revolutionary drama the achievement of strictly progressive dramatic art. This is precisely the most serious task currently facing War of Resistance drama creators.</p>
<p>In staging, revolutionary dramas are in principle mass dramas. For the organic unity of revolutionary consciousness and mass action, for the handling of exposure, satire, preaching, and organization in revolutionary dramas, and for the portrayal of humanitarianism and human affection in revolutionary dramas, the greatest efforts are needed to overcome the difficulties that vulgar and mediocre theatrical performances cannot imagine.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The writing and staging of historical dramas are topics with the most opinions and are difficult to reach the best conclusion. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three typical types:</p>
<p>The first type is the expressionist method. This term does not refer to European writers who admire speed, movement, and power and are dizzy from the impact of science, but rather to our folk professional opera. This deformed expression is particularly clear in Cantonese opera. The clown can play the protagonist in any play, and it is not considered strange for the four dynasties of Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming to be in the same hall. "Xi Shi" can be trapped by Zhao Zilong, and "Guan Yunchang" may as well "fight Yuchi Gong." The father is dressed in the Tang dynasty style, the mother is in the Song dynasty style, and the maternal grandfather may be in the Qing dynasty style. The son is from the early Republic of China, and the daughter is in the most modern style of 1939. All of this is not a problem because the play is always a play.</p>
<p>The second type is the representational method, which can be distinguished by Drinkwater's "Lincoln" and general European and American historical biographical films. They research, they imitate, they seek to be as similar as possible in every detail, and every move is antique. However, they often produce lifeless antiques, or the meticulous realism hinders its emotional effect.</p>
<p>The third method is critical, which is to reorganize historical materials through modern people, permeate the power and demands of the current masses into the remains of history, and give new life to the dead corpses with our fiery and strong will to survive. Under the ancient clothes, there is a lively, current, and combative spirit. This is an active method, which is to critically accept history from our perspective, making the visualized ancient times a symbol of our demands. In this way, we are different from the so-called expressive style. Our attitude must be absolutely rigorous, our research work must be practiced together, we must understand the society of that era, and study the social causes, historical significance, and current impact of an event. We cannot allow any puppets or clothes racks to walk onto the stage. Our understanding of history, critical attitude, and artistic performance must be integrated.</p>
<p>At the same time, our greatest effort is not to passively follow the trivial and cumbersome details of history, but to arouse the public's awareness of current tasks in the ancient images.</p>
<p>Especially today, when everything is subject to the War of Resistance and everything serves the War of Resistance, our academic cultivation, work experience, and material conditions are extremely scarce. We only have this one standard, which is also the only method.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The trinity of mass, revolution, and historical drama is an urgent topic for today's art lovers. To expand the field of drama and win over a large number of masses with lower cultural levels. There must be a recreational and enlightening effect in the high level of defense. We must overcome all kinds of difficulties to realize this task.</p>
<p>This will be a glorious tradition, and all drama workers must rise up to be the creators of this tradition!</p>
<h3>The China Salvation Drama Troupe: Preparing for the 742nd Great Performance - A Large-Scale Charity Performance at Lee Theatre on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this Month</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhuo</p>
<p>For more than a year, the China Salvation Drama Troupe has traveled all over the north, south, east, and west, performing 741 times on the front lines, in the rear, in cities, and in rural areas. These are my tears, your tears, and the tears of others! These are the words I want to say, the words you want to say, and the words everyone wants to say! This is my experience, your experience, and everyone's experience. This is my way out, your way out, and everyone's way out—such dramas have moved countless compatriots and inspired countless compatriots!</p>
<p>In Shangcheng, peasants who came to see the play from all directions refused to leave and slept under the stage, bringing rice to cook and prepare to watch again the next night and the night after.</p>
<p>In one place—Xuzhou—after the performance, the moved soldiers said to the "China Salvation" friends, "You are performing us. The officers on your stage are exactly like our officers."</p>
<p>In another place—Luoyang—before the performance was over, it suddenly rained heavily. The officer ordered the brothers to temporarily return to the team to avoid the rain and wait. However, the brothers were reluctant to leave and preferred to be soaked in the rain for more than two hours to continue watching.</p>
<p>In another place—Dabie Mountains—the peasants who had watched the play asked the "China Salvation" friends, "Is what you are performing real or fake?" The "China Salvation" friends showed them the "Records of the Brutalities of the × People." The shy women covered their eyes and dared not look, and they all scolded ×××. From then on, they started visitation and organization work, becoming a strong force to defend the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>Recently, they arrived in Shaoguan and moved countless generals and soldiers in a troop-comforting performance. General Zhang Fakui, on the "March 12" Arbor Day, gathered all the soldiers and personally directed them to salute the "China Salvation" friends and earnestly exhorted them.</p>
<p>...Such facts are truly endless. Why do they have such appeal? The answer is very simple. The members of the troupe, in addition to Jinshan and Wang Ying, the fourteen comrades who departed from Shanghai and the partners absorbed along the way are all outstanding young people with high enthusiasm and correct political awareness. Because of their hard work and strict lives, they have won the sympathy and help of all parties, which is naturally not an accident.</p>
<p>They will go abroad to comfort overseas Chinese, using facts to let the overseas Chinese know that the money and efforts they have spent in the past have not been wasted. They will also mobilize the financial resources of overseas Chinese to complete the great tasks of the "Wounded Soldiers' Hospital," "Cultural Food Supply Center," and "Rear Handicraft Institute" in the war zone. This is an urgent task, a task that China Salvation friends can complete, and a task that we should help with.</p>
<p>After the "China Salvation" arrived in Hong Kong, the climax of "welcome" and "reunion" surged. What about the drama? Because of their meticulous preparations, they have not yet met us. "Hurry up and perform"! "Hurry up and perform"! Many people are waiting so earnestly.</p>
<p>Over the past month, the "China Salvation" friends have been preparing for出国 procedures and rehearsing new dramas, continuing to maintain the spirit of serving in the war zone with their tense lives and hard work. They are scheduled to go abroad in early next month. The performance? There are already signs, which readers will be happy to hear!</p>
<p>Now, the Hong Kong Valley Realm Relief Refugee Joint Committee, because of its admiration for the troupe's outstanding achievements and refined dramatic art in domestic work in the past, has decided to invite the troupe to perform a large-scale charity performance for the association before出国 for the purpose of expanding salvation propaganda and raising funds to help wounded soldiers and refugees. Members have been sent to obtain the troupe's consent, and the China News Reporters Association has been recommended to host this performance, and the Four Women's Federation, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chung Sing Charitable Society, and the Chinese Artists Association and other organizations have been recommended to form a special charity performance committee to be responsible for handling it. The first special committee meeting was held the day before yesterday, and after detailed discussions, the main points were decided: 1. The performance venue is at Lee Theatre. Performance time: This month's 25th, 26th, and 27th, three consecutive nights. Performance repertoire: "Defend the Motherland" on the first night, "National Eternity" on the second night, and "Spring of Taierzhuang" on the third night. 3. Ticket prices are divided into five types: two cents, five cents, one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan.</p>
<p>In recent days, they have been rehearsing vigorously at Lee Theatre, and all the friends who have visited praised their serious attitude. The Youth Drama Association and other drama workers have been invited to help perform supporting roles and have been deeply moved. This is a very good influence.</p>
<p>The reporter visited China Salvation friends yesterday and went to the backstage of Lee Theatre to carefully observe their work, and I believe even more that the plot and performance skills of the three plays will have great success.</p>
<p>Especially unprecedented in the Hong Kong drama world, their realistic scenery hall has everything, great and unique, costing a total of more than 2,000 Hong Kong dollars. The troupe's talented friends are carefully making it, and the several floors of the backstage of Lee Theatre have now become a workshop. City walls, hillsides, stone monuments, houses... are truly extremely vivid. The reporter even thought that several peach trees were real. As for the magnificent and beautiful various screens, Mr. Hui Shan said: "After the performance, the cloth strips can be folded up and the wooden frames can be separated and packed into boxes, which is very convenient to take to Southeast Asia."</p>
<p>"Thunder" and "wind" all have specially made equipment. When pushed, they sound like real thunder and real wind. The reporter was very interested and played with them several times, secretly admiring the experience. If I return to the mainland to do drama work, this will be the most practical lesson. Other sounds such as airplanes and gunshots also have ways to make them realistic.</p>
<p>As for the lighting, more than one thousand yuan was spent and many parts were purchased from the United States. In order to facilitate the control of the lighting, the steel mesh above the stage was recklessly removed. In the future performances, whether it is morning, noon, dusk, or night, it can be set off with lighting. The scenery and lighting cost a total of more than 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. This is an unprecedented miracle in Hong Kong. Coupled with the vivid plot and the refined actors, the performance will surely be a blockbuster and create a great new record for Hong Kong drama. At the same time, the troupe not only performs charity performances but also took out more than 3,000 Hong Kong dollars for performance expenses, which is also the pinnacle of charity performances.</p>
<p>The troupe's past performances were in mountainous wildernesses and streets... which is the stage. Why is it so particular now when they arrive? The answer is very simple: to let overseas Chinese and international friends understand that our New China's drama level can reach this point.</p>
<p>China Salvation's 742nd large-scale performance will meet with Hong Kong compatriots. This is their epoch-making record and also Hong Kong's drama scene epoch-making record. Let us enthusiastically help and promote it!</p>
<p>Drama Movement Status</p>
<h3>All Hong Kong Drama Industry Swears National Oath - Scheduled to Be Held at Po Hing Theatre This Morning</h3>
<p>Since the central authorities promulgated the National Covenant Oath for Spiritual Mobilization Personnel, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have also responded one after another. Major community organizations have held the National Covenant Oath several times, with a total of more than 100,000 participants. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for saving the country and the bright future of the national War of Resistance. Now, hundreds of film and drama workers in Hong Kong, under the call of the Huanghuagang Performance Committee, have scheduled to hold the National Covenant Oath for Spiritual Mobilization at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon at 9:00 this morning. Mr. Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, will be the oath supervisor, and Mr. Dishi Shan, Zhong Tianxin, and Xia Yan will be invited to give speeches. More than 40 drama groups, including the China Salvation Drama Troupe, the China Art Drama Troupe, the China Travel Drama Troupe, the Shishi Drama Troupe, the First Drama Troupe of the Guangdong Drama Association, and the Youth Drama Association, will participate in the oath. The oath ceremony has been recommended to be organized by Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Jinshan, Tang Huaiqiu, Zhong Qinan, Huang Ninglin, Yi Guochi, Li Hua, and Lu Dun, and Liang Fuhe, Zhan Gefen, Huang Keshan, Zhong Ping, Xi Feng, Xu Guoyu, Zhu Baishui, Hai Yan, Chen Biyi, Ou Ai, Li Jieying, Lulu, Tang De, Deng Zhujun, Yang Wei, and Tang Ruoqing have been selected as cadres, with Liang Fuhe as the general secretary and Xi Feng and Zhong Ping as the deputy general secretaries, responsible for preparing everything. It is hoped that all drama workers in Hong Kong will actively participate in this sacred and great ceremony today!</p>
<p>Huanghuagang Will Be Re-Staged - Final Rehearsal at South China Middle School Today</p>
<p>The performance of the national revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang" mobilized more than 300 drama workers and more than 200 choir workers in Hong Kong, creating unprecedented cooperation in the drama industry. The enthusiasm of the audience, the greatness of the scale, and the tension of the emotions can be said to be an epoch-making event in Hong Kong drama. However, due to various reasons, the audience could not be popularized, which is a pity! In order to promote the publicity more widely and increase income, re-staging at a low price can be said to be a unanimous request. Therefore, after several discussions between the Hong Kong Drama Circle Huanghuagang Performance Committee and the All-Circles Joint Association Charity Performance Special Committee, it was decided to re-stage "Huanghuagang" at the Po Hing Theatre in Kowloon on the nights of the 20th and 21st of this month to raise funds for the Relief Association to comfort the families of the soldiers who died on the front lines. At the same time, the 20th of this month is precisely the 50th birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, the pioneer of our Chinese drama movement. In order to commemorate our drama pioneers' decades of arduous struggle in the drama field, and even more to give the vast number of latecomers a close study, this re-staging is also a charity performance to celebrate Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's 50th birthday. At the same time, a "Hong Kong Drama Circle Celebration of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's Fiftieth Birthday Charity Performance Committee" was organized to be responsible for the future performance work. Under the name of the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Joint Association, it is actively carrying out the work of re-staging "Huanghuagang" and is scheduled to hold the final rehearsal at South China Middle School at 1:00 this afternoon (14th). In a week, we can face this great national revolutionary drama again.</p>
<p>China Civil Servants Association Drama Group to Perform "Phoenix City" Tonight</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Government Civil Servants Association has been established for sixteen years. Their promotion of association affairs is always based on seeking the interests of civil servants, and they also spare no effort to respond to the cause of the motherland. Now, before the solicitation of members is over, the association has specially scheduled to hold the 16th anniversary celebration of its establishment at the association's clubhouse on the 8th floor of the China Building at 7:00 pm this evening (14th), to connect the feelings of new and old members. The purpose is to have the drama group of the association's entertainment department perform the drama "Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Integrity" (ie, Phoenix City) and other programs to celebrate. This play was performed twice by the China Travel Drama Troupe at the Last Theatre, and the whole hall was full, with many people unable to get tickets, winning a lot of praise for its artistic improvement. This performance by the association was guided by Mr. Li Chenfeng, a giant in the Hong Kong drama world, and performed in Cantonese. It is believed that there will definitely be good results at that time.</p>
<p>The China Salvation Drama Troupe Working in the Dabie Mountains</p>
<h3>741 Performances</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>The curtain is still closed</p>
<p>A hawker with two large black plasters on his head, a half-smoked cigarette clipped to his ear, and a roll of paper tucked under his feet walks out in front of the stage. While the audience is paying attention, the hawker suddenly jumps off the stage, raises his hand high, and shouts loudly, "Hey, wanna see the extra edition, just published"! "Wanna see the Japanese are firing in Zhabei again"! "Wanna see the Chinese soldiers are extremely powerful"! "Oh, it's a newsboy"! The audience smiles at each other, grabs the leaflets from the newsboy's hand, and applauds enthusiastically. The actor playing the newsboy circles the venue several times, distributes all the printed slogan leaflets, and then quietly walks out of the Taiping Gate.</p>
<p>While the audience is looking for the newsboy, they suddenly hear a loud scolding sound from behind the curtain, "Go, go"! Accompanied by the heavy sound of leather shoes, several men and women are pushed out from the side of the stage, looking very embarrassed. An officer and four brothers are escorting them. All the traitors have a paper flag inserted in their backs, "Shoot the traitor ×××." Several people follow behind, pointing and scolding fiercely; each of the traitors remorsefully says that they were used by the × people and instigated by the big traitor. "Drag them out to be shot"! the officer orders, and the brothers immediately drag the traitors to the back of the stage. The people follow off the stage, and the officer then gives a very painful speech to the audience, saying that the traitors are pitiful and ignorant, and that conscience and spirit must not be lost. Even to the death, they should not forget that they are Chinese descendants and must never speak for the × people and harm their own motherland. Finally, he specifically mentioned that every Chinese should step up the prevention and detection of traitors, "If you catch a traitor, please send them to the headquarters immediately, I will be waiting there"!</p>
<p>The curtain slowly opens. The air is quite solemn. The nurses in white are constantly busying themselves. A small canvas bed is lying with various wounded heroes. In their moans, they recall the battle of Shanghai, the flesh and blood charge on the front lines. Just as they are talking with great relish, a wounded soldier near the stage suddenly cries loudly. He has not spoken all along. At this time, he says his regret in front of the shocked heroes, "I was deceived by the warlords of my country, I shouldn't have come to fight you, to fight this meaningless battle." From his words, we know that he is a prisoner who was caught not long ago. "I never thought you would treat me so well, I was wrong"! He continues to wail. At this time, our wounded soldiers and doctors comfort him and explain to him that the Japanese people have no hatred for the Chinese people. This war is not good for the Japanese people. He hoped ×××××××××××"! The prisoner also raises his hand and shouts loudly.</p>
<p>In neat steps, the curtain opens.</p>
<p>Holding long guns, holding knives, holding hoes, long gowns, short gowns, a team with incomplete weapons and incomplete clothing is listening to the officer's lecture, "You can't escape if you have fields on your shoulders. Follow ×× and do it"! The officer repeats this slogan, and says that as long as we persevere, ×× will definitely be driven away. The strong men listen intently. After the lecture, the flag-raising sound resounds. The people on the stage stand at attention, and all the people under the stage stand up. The great and solemn national anthem slowly rises up.</p>
<p>The whole play is over. The audience expresses unlimited goodwill in the long applause.</p>
<p>The comrades almost all go on stage in every scene. At this time, just as they are preparing to take a breath and wash their faces well with well water, the alarm sounds, and the whole city is immersed in darkness again. We rush to the backyard, and we have to spend the night in the cold air raid shelter again tonight. "Come on, ×× in the sky, the Chinese people can no longer be intimidated by bombs and massacres"!</p>

<p>A Vanguard of South China Drama: The Growth and Internal Conflicts of the Cangjiang Troupe</p>
<p>— Tao·Tao· Gaoming Correspondent</p>
<p>In the great era and great environment, humanity is educated by war, and war is also educating humanity. If any sector cannot dissolve itself into the war effort, it will only be eliminated and destroyed by the war. Therefore, in over twenty months of the war of resistance, the flames of war across the motherland have destroyed countless timid and opportunistic cultural groups and workers. At the same time, how many heroic and resolute cultural circles and workers have been newly born and grown! In particular, the theater sector has shown leaping progress in the flames of the war of resistance. The Cangjiang Troupe, which I am about to report on, is such a product.</p>
<p>They emerged from the painful stimulus of the September 18th Incident. The patriotic youth of the Third District of Gaoming County felt that the Chinese national liberation movement would inevitably develop strongly. To meet the needs of the future war, they actively improved their tactical requirements, and the Cangjiang Troupe grew. The initial organization's funding was very short. However, through arduous struggle, they also acquired tents, gas lamps, and many drama books and props. Regarding drama, each member had little cultivation or skill. Only filled with enthusiasm, they bravely participated in this new work. They wanted to learn from real life, find teaching materials and experience. At this time, from many criticisms, they heard a lot of "unreasonable" contempt. However, the more they heard this tone, the more spirited they became, and the more they wanted to fight. Thus, this new type of energetic commando team actually progressed and became stronger amidst this "unreasonable" contempt, and wrote a glorious contribution in the history of the drama movement.</p>
<p>The Course of Struggle In the spring of 1939, the Cangjiang Troupe began its commando life. All twenty members became a mixed team of primary school teachers, students, and young farmers. The scope of work was very broad, including Gaoming, Gaoyao, Hecheng, and Xinxing. They wanted to spread the passion of saving the country to the poor and remote areas of the above-mentioned places, to inspire the audience. Most excitingly, at that time, the Chinese drama movement was just budding, and the travel expenses for these three months were raised by themselves. Those farmer members who came from leisure gathered this group in a very difficult environment and bravely embarked on the journey. At that time, what they felt most helpless was the lack of contact and assistance from the upper echelons in various places, and the arrangement of the impromptu theaters in the countryside was not easy to mobilize. However, these shortcomings were not enough to shake their work, because they had a persevering spirit and the drama that the people liked most. Therefore, no matter where they went, they received sympathy and gained the masses. For example, every time they arrived, they lived in ancestral halls and temples. These places were considered by the villagers to be places where only beggars and hooligans could stay. After the work started, the villagers watched their plays and were moved. They felt that their sleep on the ground and their lives were even inferior to their own, and they were very sad. Some quickly found bed boards for them, or kitchenware and props, and others rushed to cook and carry water for them, and give them fish, rice, melons, and vegetables. In such close cooperation, they saw that the future of the movement was bright, so they had to work harder and endure hardship. After the July 7th Incident, they worked more closely to meet the needs of the war of resistance in a strong manner. From then on, they not only encouraged the people, but also organized them. The Qingfu Anti-Japanese Comrades Association and the Farmers' Association Support Association in various districts of Gaoming County used their greatest strength to assist in their growth.</p>
<p>Great Effect In the great national revolutionary war of resistance, drama that can truly achieve the effect of education and political action among the broad masses is the emerging drama of the current stage. Gaoming County is the root of the Cangjiang Troupe. Since the country implemented the conscription system, more than 400 pure and good farmers in the county bravely volunteered to join the army to fight for the opportunity to kill the enemy. This number cannot be matched by any other county. These strong men are all children of farmers. Not only did they not evade or find substitutes, but they were very excited to use their blood and flesh to defend the country. This supreme glory can be said to be the influence and excitement of countless performances of the Cangjiang Troupe. After Guangzhou retreated, the enemy troops advanced along the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Foshan Highway into Jiujiang, the downstream of Gaoyao and Gaoming, and became the front line. The enemy's malicious propaganda poured in, and many people were misled by this poison for a while. At the front line, the anti-Japanese sentiment in many villages suddenly collapsed, and even local forces were used to hinder their own troops. At this time, the Cangjiang Troupe quickly rushed to the rescue with its strong combat power, concentrated its firepower on the target and fired, and more strongly exerted the heat of the drama struggle. At present, the people in the area can closely cooperate with the troops in combat, which is also the achievement of the fighters of the Cangjiang Troupe who fought from the enemy's torrent.</p>
<p>In the villages and towns, after the drama performance, they began to visit the families of soldiers on expedition and collect condolences. They educated them on how to respond to the war, prevent poison, clear traitors, and strengthen the walls and clear the fields. Because the people had a good understanding of them after watching the drama and developed feelings, it would be unexpectedly convenient to do anything with this advantage. Everywhere they went, they organized children's choirs, taught children to sing, so that on the one hand, the children understood the meaning and function of the group, on the other hand, they popularized patriotic songs, and on the other hand, they used the children's choir to mobilize the audience along the street.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fact is so undeniable: only China's new drama can most easily move the Chinese people, and only China's new drama can most easily lead the Chinese people. When the War of Resistance opened, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared to us "...Propaganda is more important than combat, and the people are more important than soldiers..." Such heroic drama workers on the front line, their contribution to the War of Resistance is no less than that of the heroic soldiers. That is definitely not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Organization and Funding Due to the abundance of work experience, the organization is also very strict and sound. The organization of the Cangjiang Troupe is a troupe leader, two deputy troupe leaders, and then divided into general affairs, public relations, documents, general affairs, and compilation. Each unit can strive to exert its own task and compete for the expected results. As for the source of funds, in addition to donations, they also received funding from the government, and sometimes they even took it on themselves. In this hard-working situation, they had to work hard to save resources, but the clever use of stage equipment had incredible skills. As long as they spend a little money, they can get good results with their rich experience and design. Because they are new drama people, great public artists.</p>
<p>Shortcomings and Difficulties The biggest disadvantage is that the location is too deep in the Yi village, and it is easy not to get the guidance and assistance from the urban cultural circles. For example, the acquisition of newspapers and periodicals, the changes in international and war affairs are known slowly, and even the progress of the Chinese drama movement is unknown. This greatly affects the progress of the work. There is also one thing that they can never forget, that is, they have not been able to transform to a wider land. As for the difficulties, according to the most serious problem at present, we must entrust that the funds have not yet been settled regularly. The future plan is to expand the organization to enrich combat power, such as increasing the purchase of projectors, radios, cameras, and simple mobile troupe so necessary scientific equipment, preparing to expand their guerrilla area, expand the scope of publicity. However, this more meaningful expansion requires more powerful forces, especially funding. For the future of China's new drama movement, for the life-and-death struggle of the national revolution, advanced groups and volunteers engaged in drama movement should be given correct guidance and practical assistance.</p>

<h3>A Seemingly Equivocal Draw: The Xu He Cup Remains Undecided; South China and Navy Tie 1-1; Decisive Battle Rescheduled for Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the Xu He Cup final held at Mount Jia resulted in a seemingly equivocal draw. Consequently, the issue of the championship remains undecided and will await a rematch next Wednesday to determine the victor. Most spectators also extended their association with the match.</p>
<p>The situation during the match was more mundane than exciting. South China maintained a 1-0 lead from the start until the 20th minute of the second half. The gleaming silver cup appeared to be within their grasp. However, fate played a trick, and disaster struck suddenly. The Navy, with the referee's assistance, reclaimed lost ground. Many felt that South China suffered an injustice from this loss, but the referee's authority supersedes all. I refrain from expressing an opinion.</p>
<p>The lack of excitement in the performance was due to the hot weather, which significantly affected the players' spirits.</p>
<p>Judging by the circumstances, South China's forward line, although not performing to its fullest, still created numerous opportunities. Victory was originally within their grasp, but unfortunately, Yang Shuiyi and Ye Beihua were slow to capitalize, allowing the Navy to eventually salvage the perilous situation through arduous struggle.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, South China should have won 2-0. However, due to the referee's differing judgment, the situation changed accordingly. On one occasion, Shuiyi shot a goal, and it was brilliant, but the referee called him offside and disallowed it. Conversely, Tuo Pan headed a ball that appeared not to have entered the goal but was hooked out by Li Tiansheng. However, the referee ruled it as a goal. A hair's breadth difference resulted in an enormous error. Truly, there is fortune and misfortune. According to Tiansheng afterward, that ball definitely did not enter the goal.</p>
<p>The comings and goings of warships are uncertain. Therefore, Navy players have the right to compete without registering with the association. Consequently, the lineup for yesterday's match featured a few new faces. Central defender Gu Ba was well-positioned, rarely attacking and focusing on defense. Hence, Feng Jingxiang found it difficult to exert his abilities under his marking. Wen Nei Ya was also steady.</p>
<p>In the forward line, Yan Shi Du Lang and Tuo Pan were the most active. New player Shuang Te was excellent at cutting the ball, especially on corner kicks. Thus, his indirect contribution to reclaiming a goal was significant.</p>
<p>Among South China's forwards, Shuiyi's performance lacked excellence, and it is inappropriate for him to insist on playing on the left wing. The team selection for next week should revert to Luo Douwen in that position. Cutting the feet to fit the shoes is not a good plan. Guo Yingqi's performance was also not as sharp as when he plays as a forward. Ye Beihua was too intrusive. Therefore, the entire forward line often suffered from a lack of coordination.</p>
<p>All six defenders demonstrated their skills, safeguarding the fortress with few flaws. Therefore, the failure to win yesterday was not due to defensive weakness but to the lack of ferocity in the attack. If Li Huitang or Li Zhaorong were to play in the rematch next Wednesday, along with central defender Liang Rongzhao, the attack and defense would be strengthened, and victory would come naturally. However, it remains to be seen whether the revised lineup will meet expectations.</p>
<p>Some say that the match lasted seventy minutes, and as no winner was determined, and no extra time was played, it benefited South China. If extra time had been played, South China, exhausted from the hard fight, might have been defeated. I agree with this view.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, the Navy seized the initiative. Yan Shi Du Lang and Mo Lishi attacked through the pass and advanced into South China's territory. Tiansheng rushed out from the side and kicked the ball out of danger. Subsequently, the ball was in the center, with both sides battling back and forth. At six minutes, Qingcai made a brilliant pass, which was intercepted by Guangsen Adou. He ran with the ball, bypassed the pass, and advanced. Upon reaching the key area, he cut in, and the ball dropped from the high altitude, not far from the goal. At this time, heads were seen bobbing, and bodies were interweaving. However, Jingxiang finally headed the ball into the lower square of the goal, bouncing off the post and into the net. Di Jia Chen attempted to save it but was too late. South China thus took a 1-0 lead. The Navy, starting the game again, launched a determined attack. Gu Ba passed short to Yan Shi Du Lang, who advanced from the side. He then passed back to Mo Yashi for a shot, but Mo's overhead attack was unsuccessful, and they retreated without success. Continuing their attack at the eighteen-minute mark, both Tuo Pan and Shuang Te had opportunities to shoot. However, due to inaccurate shooting, they ultimately failed to score. After a while, South China counterattacked, with Guangsen and Jingxiang shooting in succession. The former was caught by Huo Jia Chen's keen eyes and quick hands, while the latter went high over the top.</p>
<p>As the battle continued, the Navy grew bolder, forcing two corner kicks in a row, besieging South China's goal. Fortunately, the three armies of South China obeyed orders, reversing the situation. By the twenty-fifth minute, Jingxiang and Yingqi, after several short passes, had broken through the Navy's defense. Unfortunately, due to the two of them giving way to each other to shoot, Xuan Di seized the opportunity to save. Later, Shuiyi shot a ball in the midst of the chaos, but the referee signaled that Yang was offside, so it did not count. Soon after, the first half ended.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Navy's morale soared. In the blink of an eye, Shuang Te rushed into the key area to shoot, forcing a corner kick. It was kicked just right, and Rongcai punched it out, only to be caught by Yan Shi Du Lang. Fortunately, Yan shot aimlessly and fell into the desolate suburbs.</p>
<p>During the melee at seven minutes, Jingxiang and Beihua launched a dual offensive, but were blocked by Han Niwei Lu. As a result, South China gradually felt unsupported. At twenty minutes, a leak was seen, and finally, the pass turned to the side and delivered a high pass, which was headed in by Tuo Pan. Although Tiansheng saved it, the referee had already ruled it a goal.</p>
<p>With the score tied, the match became tense. However, both of Shuiyi's two shots failed to score, and the Navy's all-out attack also failed to yield further results. Before long, the game ended. Because both sides were unwilling to play extra time, the game ended in a 1-1 draw, and it was decided to replay at 4:30 p.m. on the 17th of this month (Wednesday). The lineups of the two teams are listed below.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Baseball League: The Chinese Team Turns Defeat into Victory; Hong Kong Club's Momentum Falters; Two Matches Held This Morning</h3>
<p>In the Open Baseball League, the Chinese team played against the Hong Kong Club team at the Jiaochu Navy Stadium yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm.</p>
<p>Hu Guodong, a new player for the Chinese team, guarded first base and caught the ball steadily, but his hitting was still poor. Huang Rongjun served as the pitcher for the first two innings and was in a very bad state. He gave up a walk in the first inning and then threw inaccurately, allowing Sa, Walker, and Layton to reach base one after another, losing three points in a row. In the second inning, Huang's spirit was still wandering, and he gave up three walks, allowing Bo Dishida, Dora Da, and Ke Lihua to score three points.</p>
<p>The team's coordination gradually recovered from the third inning onward, and the lineup changed as follows. Qu Bingnan (i.e., Canary), who served as right fielder, gave a good performance, repeatedly catching the opponent's fly balls and defending firmly. Chen Fang and Lin Ye's hitting were also excellent, scoring points for China. They were able to turn defeat into victory with a score of eight to six.</p>
<p>Looking at the Chinese team's two games, there were often mistakes in defense and weaknesses in offense. Hitting, in particular, was not as good as last year, which may be due to a lack of practice.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Club has recruited many good players and strengthened its lineup. The offense is quite fierce. Pitcher Rowland is steady and solid. Ke Lihua, Yisa, Bo Dishida, and Zhi Dun are all good players. Catcher Walker is quick on his feet and is a completely different person compared to last year. He reached base four times as a hitter and scored one point, which is commendable. The scores of the players on both sides are listed below.</p>

<h3>Exhibition Tennis Match: Performance Was Very Mundane, Few Spectators</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm, the exhibition tennis match held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club, all proceeds from ticket sales were allocated to the Hong Kong Branch of the British Fund. Before the match, there were not many spectators in the seats priced at $1.50 and $1.00. The general expectation was that the crowd would gather after the start of the match. However, the reality was different, and the number of spectators remained sparse. The ticket revenue performance is believed to be not very impressive.</p>
<p>A total of four groups of famous players participated in the performance. The Hong Kong doubles champion and runner-up teams, as well as the two strongest teams, all appeared on time. Unexpectedly, each of their performances was unremarkable. Perhaps they did not do so intentionally, but the performances were indeed a bit too casual.</p>
<p>The Xu brothers, the Hong Kong doubles champions, lost to the new partnership of De Fu and Gao Erman after winning two rounds of the Lin Zhen match, with a score of 2-6. In the final round, the Lin Zhen brothers faced De Fu and Gao Erman, and De and Gao were completely defeated by the Lin brothers, with a score of 6-1. Among the five rounds of performances yesterday, the Lin Zhen brothers performed the best. In addition to losing to the Xu brothers, they defeated the He Li team and the De Gao team with a score of 6-1 in both rounds. However, it was a pity that they were at a disadvantage in the battle against the Xu brothers.</p>
<p>Round 1 The He family and Li Rurong team faced off against the De Fu and Gao Erman team. The De Gao team gave a stern demonstration, winning five games in a row. Unexpectedly, they would rise up in this critical moment and win seven games in a row, turning defeat into victory. De Gao Team—7-5—He Li Team</p>
<p>Round 2 The Xu brothers against the Lin Zhen brothers, Xu Runpei, served first and lost two games in a row. Then, they pulled back the third and fifth games. After losing the sixth game, the Xu brothers shook their spirits in the seventh game and regained a game. Then, they tied the score and took two games in one go, winning with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Xu Team—6-4—Lin Zhen Team</p>
<p>Round 3 The Xu brothers against the De Fu and Gao Luman team, the Xu brothers gave a stern demonstration first and won one game. Then, they lost five games in a row. They were only a little energetic in the seventh game, but the situation was gone, and they were defeated with a score of 2-6. In this game, the Xu brothers' spirits were distracted, and there were many mistakes. On the other hand, De and Gao recognized that a major enemy was in front of them. Although it was a friendly match, winning would also be a glorious thing. Therefore, they always gave full play to their strength and finally won.</p>
<p>De Gao Team—6-2—Xu Team</p>
<p>Round 4 The Lin Zhen brothers against the He family Li Rurong, when enemies meet, they are particularly clear-sighted. The Lin family will remember the suffering they have suffered from Li in the past, and this time they will be extra careful and use their practiced methods to prevent He and Li from having the opportunity to deploy their tenacious strategy. Therefore, the He and Li only won one game and were defeated.</p>
<p>Lin Zhen Team…6-1…He Li Team</p>
<p>Round 5 The Lin Zhen brothers fought against De Ban Gao and Zhao, and Yulin Zhen fought with the remaining power of the He team, driving straight in. They won with a score of 6-1. The All-Hong Kong Tennis Friendly Tournament ended plainly.</p>
<p>Lin Zhen Team—6-1—De Gao Team</p>
<h3>Basketball Charity Game: China Overwhelms Mei Fang, YMCA Defeats Star Team</h3>
<p>The YMCA held a men's and women's basketball charity game last night to raise funds for the army service corps. In the first game, the women's teams of China and Mei Fang both sent their full squads. The game lacked fierce competition. China's team was a mixed squad, and their coordination was lacking. Only individual skills were on display. Li Shenyu and Ye Mengzhen had strong attacks, and Liu Shouguang's posture was clever, but her shooting was inaccurate. The defender Rao Huizhen was quite responsible, while He Cui and others were not outstanding. Mei Fang's Ye Meilian did not play, but Lu Xian attacked openly and secretly, achieving good results repeatedly. Chen Yuemei and Huang Baozhen also had skillful shots. As for the defenders, they were neither good nor bad. Therefore, the two teams had their own strengths, and the outcome was not too one-sided. The first quarter was nine to seven, and the second quarter was seventeen to twelve. China maintained the lead. After switching sides, Mei Fang fought hard and tied the score at twenty-two to twenty-two. By the end of the third quarter, they had taken the lead with twenty-two to fourteen. The competition became more intense in the fourth quarter, and the two sides tied again at thirty-one. Until the end of the game, China finally won with thirty-six to thirty-three.</p>
<p>In the second game, the men's teams of the YMCA and the Star Team played. The former was a mixed team of Xingdao, South China, and Zhong Sheng, while the latter was a transformed Eastern team, with the addition of Qiu Mian from Pei Ying, and Guo Zhihong from Zhong Sheng. Since both sides considered this a performance match, the outcome was not important. Therefore, they avoided rough moves, and real skills were able to be displayed. Chen Ruzheng was the best player in the entire game. He and Liu Deyu cooperated seamlessly. Liang Guoyi, Li Peiyan, Jie Min, and others also played brilliantly. Star Team's Feng Nianhua's shot-faking and turning moves were able to avoid the opponent's defense and earned a lot of cheers. The other players also fulfilled their duties. Guo and Qiu had some misunderstandings due to their unfamiliarity with the team's coordination.</p>
<p>In the course of the game, the YMCA took the lead with eleven to seven and twenty-one to nine. At the end of the half, they still led with twenty-eight to nineteen. After switching sides, the YMCA's attack weakened, and they were forced to a tie at thirty-three to thirty-three, and then fell behind at thirty-three to thirty-five. Afterwards, the Star Team had a smooth run, taking the lead with forty-one to thirty-eight and forty to forty-six. Until the last six seconds, the Star Team was still winning with forty-nine to forty-eight. Then Chen Ruzheng got the ball and shot, and the ball went in just as the final whistle blew. The YMCA thus won with fifty to forty-nine.</p>

<h3>A Word to the South China Football Club</h3>
<p>— A Member</p>
<p>Hong Kong people value sports. For decades, the most popular sport has been football. Our club – South China – has spared no effort in promoting it. Talents have emerged in large numbers, and achievements have been remarkable. The team has participated in various competitions and consistently won championships, maintaining its prestigious reputation to this day. However, accumulating greatness is not something that can be achieved overnight. It relies on the efforts of successive leaders in providing facilities, as well as the players' dedication to competition, to build this towering and admired position. This is truly a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether the selection of football club members is appropriate is crucial to the club's operations. As far as I know, for the past ten years or so, the club's officials have always been selected from those who are deeply familiar with the internal situation and have close relationships with the athletes, and who are also smart and capable. In the past, the football department was the busiest and most difficult to manage among all the club's departments. If the person in charge is not capable and the management is not thorough, it will be difficult to handle the numerous and complex affairs smoothly.</p>
<p>The new officials of the club have been selected this year and are all known to be quick-witted, promising, and enthusiastic about club affairs. It is appropriate to entrust them with these responsibilities. However, there are still some murmurs among the club members, saying that while the new officials are talented and capable, they may not be able to handle this responsibility fully. It is not enough to be talented and capable to manage everything without any worries of failure. It is because they are not deeply familiar with the internal situation of the club and do not yet know the difficulty of managing and taking responsibility. There are many deeply rooted and complex issues within the club, and it is not easy to handle them without experience. Now that this important task is entrusted to the new officials, whether they can meet the expectations of the club members in planning and handling internal and external affairs remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I have always regarded the club's affairs as my own and have high expectations for the new officials. I sincerely wish them success in their new endeavors and comfort the club members. As the ancient sages said, "It is difficult to start a career, and it is also not easy to maintain it." Now, the new team members are not just maintaining the status quo. Moreover, social undertakings do not belong to individuals but to the public. If the management is not appropriate in the future, it would be better to take a step back. I express my sincere feelings with deep intentions, hoping that the new officials will do their best.</p>

<h3>Sleeping Pills</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Before I set off, I received a letter from Teacher Yu, asking me to buy a bottle of An Gen Hua from Doctor Lin and send it from the post office. I hadn't seen Teacher Yu for a long time. I heard that he was very active in the guerrilla area and held an important position. Why did he need sleeping pills? So I made a special detour to his town to visit him and deliver the pills directly.</p>
<p>Teacher Yu was even thinner than before, but his spirit was radiant. When he saw it was me, he greeted me repeatedly, inviting me in with "oh, oh, oh" and settling down in the Baobing Pavilion. A maid brought tea, and I took out the bottle of pills and presented it with both hands, asking him why he needed the sleeping pills. He played with the decoration on the bottle, smiled gently, and said, "I have insomnia!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a small courtyard, with green bamboo against the wall and a few artificial rocks underneath. I remembered when I used to study here and spend a lot of time here. I had been running around and achieved nothing. Teacher Yu had aged, and I had grown a beard. He asked about life on the isolated island and sighed: "Shanghai is not Shouyang Mountain after all, and wei (a type of herb) is just the money in your pocket. When the money is gone, you get squeezed out."</p>
<p>I was the one who got squeezed out. Hearing Teacher Yu's words, I felt unspeakable sadness. Teacher Yu continued:</p>
<p>"When the front line was in danger and my hometown was suffering, I once disposed of my family affairs and made a will, vowing to live and die with my country. I asked Doctor Lin to prepare a bottle of sleeping pills for me. I wrote eight lines myself, saying: 'A scholar cannot be humiliated, and the heart cannot die. What is the purpose of reading the books of sages and sages! To achieve benevolence and righteousness, I am happy in this. Heaven and earth, gods, bear witness to this!' My friends all knew about this. I made up my mind to fulfill my vow. As soon as I learned that the National Army in the city had retreated, I grabbed the bottle and poured it all down. Unexpectedly, I slept for half the night and didn't feel the slightest bit sleepy. I only heard my old wife laughing beside me. I knew I had made a mistake. This joke was not small, and people would scold me for deceiving the world and stealing fame. How could I bear it. I got up and hit my head against the wall, but I didn't die. When I woke up, everyone was surrounding me, some persuading, some talking. I didn't say a word, lying there blankly. My son spoke more reasonably. He said, 'The fall of the coastal cities was expected long ago. It cannot be compared with the loss of the country. Wen Tianxiang was loyal and upright, and when there was no way to save the situation, he died to repay the country. Now that the War of Resistance has begun, it cannot be compared with the loss of the country.' They guarded me, and there was simply no way to die. Later, my son went to the inland to participate in the War of Resistance. Before leaving, he knelt down to me, asking that his expedition be exchanged for my immortality. At this time, I myself really didn't want to die. I wanted to open my eyes and watch the great army counterattack and drive out the bandits. I sighed. Those who criticized me for not dying, I had no choice but to ignore them. Xiao Weng laughed at me: 'It is difficult to die throughout the ages. Is my heart not sad like Mrs. Xi?' Alas!</p>
<p>'Although my heart has not died, I have endured humiliation. The counterattack that we are waiting for never comes. This irritability is really unspeakable. Neither left nor right, looking at the shadow of the sun, listening to the sound, the days are like years, restless. Waiting, waiting, my nerves have become very tense, I often suffer from insomnia and become haggard. I am afraid I will wither and die. Fang Weng's poem: "When the royal army pacifies the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice," will be written for me. My old wife took out sleeping pills, which were very effective. This is really ridiculous. The earth did not kill me when I should have died, but saved me on the day I stole my life!'</p>
<p>"Now I have changed again. I feel that no matter what I do, I don't feel that time passes slowly. If I fold my sleeves and wait for others, that is worry! Rather than waiting for the counterattack, why not do it myself! I think that I have already died at that time, and now I am reborn. I have subtracted forty years from myself. I am young and strong, and I can contribute to the country. Mao Di! I am not older than you now, or even younger than you. I have learned to shoot and also know how to send and receive wireless telegraphs. We have driven away the invaders here, and this place is now a clean land. I am very happy now, and I feel a lot younger in spirit. However, I still often can't sleep at night, and I have to take medicine."</p>
<p>As I listened to him, I often raised my hand to wipe the sweat from my forehead, sitting quietly without saying a word.</p>
<p>He kept me for two days. When I left, he personally escorted me to the ferry dock, grabbed my hand, and said:</p>
<p>"If you can't become Yi Qi, go back and visit your parents. Still, come back here, definitely, I'll wait for you!"</p>
<p>His overly excited face, thin and haggard, made people uneasy. I secretly prayed that the pills could always maintain him!</p>
<h3>Manchuria's Snow</h3>
<p>— Shu Qun</p>
<p>He knew this more clearly than they did, but he just stood there, as if to say:</p>
<p>"What else can I do?"</p>
<p>When she finished changing his bandages, he said:</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>"Don't thank me! Who wants your thanks! Everything is fake!"</p>
<p>"Have I deceived you, then?"</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>"I...I haven't!"</p>
<p>"Haven't? Have you already forgotten what you said yesterday? Yesterday you said I was one of your comrades...but--but today you're sending me home! You say you're not a traitor?"</p>
<p>"..." He indicated that he understood her current mood, and then he said, "Sending you home doesn't mean you're not one of our comrades. Of course you're still one of our comrades!"</p>
<p>"Then why don't you go home? Why do you want me to go home alone?"</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, the reason for you going home---"</p>
<p>Not listening, she cried and ran back to her room, kicking at the furniture in the room, all resounding with the solid determination of her anger. She grumbled, as if saying something:</p>
<p>"...Father...you've become a traitor...you have money...why do you need to see me again...you love money...why do you still love your daughter...your daughter doesn't want a father like you..."</p>
<p>She threw herself onto the bed, as if she had hugged the telephone pole when she came, unwilling to let go a single step; she thought of this temporary room as her long-term bedroom; she didn't listen to anyone's comforting words; other people's good words only irritated her; she harbored an excessively subjective thought:</p>
<p>"I won't leave, see what you can do to me!"</p>
<p>Her coming was that unexpected and difficult: her leaving was that unexpectedly uneasy.</p>
<p>Yu Wen comforted her, even drove her away, all to no avail; he keenly felt the unexpected consequences of his work.</p>
<p>Almost half an hour had passed. The other comrades had all packed their luggage, just waiting for her to leave; after leaving, they would immediately move to another secret address. If it took too long, something unexpected might happen: then, they would lose more than just 300,000 yuan; their heads were priceless. (65)</p>
<h3>Shameless Literary Style (Gleanings from Reading)</h3>
<p>— Poor Man</p>
<p>To sing the praises of aggressors is not an easy task, because often even oneself becomes more and more unconvincing. However, our literary men have always had a good skill. That is, without regard to whether there are flaws, regardless of whether it's correct or not, just give it a boost, a boost. In fact, those flattering words are only a set formula, so there's really no way to tell if there are flaws or if it's correct. There should be a lot of historical material proving this kind of "literary style." But for the moment, the only thing I've found is "Ping Song Lu" [Record of the Pacification of the Song].</p>
<p>"Ping Song Lu" records the process of the Yuan dynasty's General Bayan pacifying the remnants of the Southern Song, a typical work of flattery. Liu Minzhong, the author, was considered a talented writer. The prefaces were written by Fang Hui, Du Daojian, and Zhou Ming. These people were probably not very skilled in "literary writing." Fortunately, I don't want to delve into their past reputations, so I won't say much more. But what should be particularly pointed out is that they were all Han Chinese. It would not be unfair at all to consider them writers of the "XX newspaper" school of more than six hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Liu Qi's preface says: "Our Holy Yuan's Grand Chancellor Bayan took Huaixi as easily as picking up mustard seeds, and pacifying Jiangnan was like turning over his hand." He also said, "Our Holy Emperor treats generals with benevolence and righteousness, and the Prince of Huai'an leads soldiers with benevolence and righteousness. People offered food and drink, and families celebrated together."</p>
<p>Fang Hui's preface says: "He did not enter the city with a single soldier or horse, did not seize a single civilian, did not plunder a single item, and it was so everywhere he went."</p>
<p>Du Daojian's preface says: "When using troops in the Jiang and Han regions, he did not enjoy killing. On the day the city fell, the people were all calm."</p>
<p>Zhou Ming's preface says: "He then led his troops to take dozens of states in Jianghuai, directly approaching Lin'an. Wherever he went, the wind swept away, and no blood was shed..."</p>
<p>These all sound very nice, but upon reading the book, one discovers many contradictory accounts, which really makes one feel that the book is strange:</p>
<p>In the year Gui Chou [1253], envoys were sent to Yangjiabao to persuade the Song generals, proclaiming the dynasty's might and virtue. The Song generals did not surrender. Xia Gui deployed over a thousand warships on the Great River, blocking the river's surface, its imposing manner seemingly unapproachable. In the year Jia Yin [1254], envoys were again sent to explain the blessings and misfortunes to the Song generals. The Song generals replied, "We have received great favors from the Great Song for generations and should fight to the death to repay the country. This is the time! How can there be any reason to betray and surrender? Prepare our armor and weapons to settle it. Today, we are betting everything on this one throw of the dice to determine the fate of the world." The Chancellor then directed the generals to attack Yangjiabao, but was unable to conquer it all day...</p>
<p>The Song soldiers were routed in the river. The morale of Yangjiabao collapsed. Of the hundreds of thousands of Song soldiers, almost all were killed or wounded, and their corpses blocked the river and flowed downstream.</p>
<p>In the year Ding Si [1277], the Chancellor hastily led his troops to Dingjiazhou... In the year Ji Wei [1277], the Chancellor directed the generals, assigning them routes, and set up cannons and crossbows along the riverbanks, attacking together—pursuing and killing for dozens of miles. Corpses floated on the river, turning the water red!</p>
<p>In the year Ren Wu [1277], they arrived at Changzhou. The advancing troops were locked in a stalemate... The Chancellor hastily summoned the generals, instructing them on strategies, ordering each to prepare siege equipment, and setting a deadline for a multi-pronged attack the next day. He also first placed men to shout loudly below the city. The city did not listen. In the year Gui Wei [1277], he again ordered clerks to write articles and shoot them into the city. They still did not listen. The Chancellor personally supervised several thousand troops from his personal guard in front of the south gate, and built many fire cannons and crossbows, attacking day and night without stopping. At Shen time [3-5 PM]... they conquered the city, and then carried out a massacre.</p>
<p>It turns out that "as easily as picking up mustard seeds" and "like turning over his hand" always meant "not surrendering" here and "not listening" there, "unable to conquer it all day" here and "attacking day and night without stopping" there. And what was called "not enjoying killing" and "no blood was shed" always meant "corpses floated down the river" here and "turning the water red" there, and "on the day the city fell, the people were all calm" always meant "massacring the city." In such a situation, it would be strange indeed if the army were so refined that not even a single "old soldier" in a tattered uniform or a horse ran into the city, nor did they capture a single civilian or steal a single item, and the people would happily prepare food and drink, with every family congratulating each other.</p>
<p>So, did the preface writers simply not read the book carefully? That's not the case. Even after reading it carefully, they still had to write in this way. The reason is, as mentioned above, because the words of praise are just this one set formula. At this point, the writers are actually quite pitiful, as they have nailed themselves to the cross.</p>
<p>However, there is another question: Since the book is mainly about flattery, why couldn't the author Liu Minzhong just say that the Grand Chancellor pacified the Southern Song without moving a single soldier or fighting a single battle? Wouldn't that have been more straightforward? But that wouldn't work either, because not only would that completely alter the historical facts, making people not believe your account at all, but it would also leave the main character in the book without any "merit" or "might." So the writer is also very pitiful at this point, just as much nailed himself to the cross.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is why it is a shameless literary style!</p>
<h3>Soviet Female Aviator (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Paulina Osipenko, Translated from Moscow News</p>
<p>I earnestly begged the principal, I have decided I want to be an aviator! I will defend the country and will not lose to those men! The principal smiled. He suggested I take a medical examination, and the doctors said I was qualified.</p>
<p>After that, I was a student at the aviation school, I had a uniform and a room in the dormitory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to tell you about the difficulties at the beginning now. I pored over books, my desire was so great, I wanted to be a knowledgeable aviator, I treasured every minute outside of reading.</p>
<p>At the same time, I saw many aviators, and things I could not have imagined before. I saw a pursuit plane rocket into the sky, turning right, then left, rotating its body, performing somersaults, flying in loops, this beetle-like machine miraculously obeying in the air, performing extraordinary feats under precise calculation, it was as silent as a bird, as elusive as a swallow, soaring in the sky above Ukraine.</p>
<p>One plane after another landed, and I stared at the faces of these aviators coming out of the cockpit, they were all people, with incredible aerial skills!</p>
<p>He, the one who drives that pursuit plane, among so many people, what is different about his face, his pace, his smile from ordinary people? I thought, his story is nothing more than starting from a factory or a collective farm, the Communist Youth League, deciding to enter this aviation school. He started flying solo, not long before me. The students don't talk much about their first flights, and soon the matter turned to me.</p>
<p>One day, I came back from practicing with the instructor, and I made a very bad landing. At that time, I really didn't dream that I would be flying solo soon. My teacher didn't say a word about my bad landing, but turned around and asked me if I was tired.</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>"Good, you can take a solo flight."</p>
<p>Happiness and surprise almost made me afraid to breathe, but I didn't abandon my senses.</p>
<p>"Very good, teacher," I replied calmly.</p>
<p>I went up, I will never forget that moment, I was alone in the air, the teacher was on the ground, I was flying solo. I made a satisfactory landing, and I took off a second time. Everything went well, and that's how my solo flight began.</p>
<p>But, I still have a long way to go, I decided I must become a successful aviator.</p>
<p>At the end of 1932, I graduated from aviation school and was sent to study to be a military aviator.</p>
<p>Soon I was appointed as a squad leader, and my work performance showed significant progress. In addition to my main job, I also did many social things, helping my husband with his studies and work. I continued to work hard, I learned to drive a tank, and at the same time, I focused on my education. I graduated from the workers' preparatory school, and I was preparing to enter military aviation school again. I flew for six years without an incident, not even a forced landing.</p>
<p>When I had enough confidence, I asked my commander to allow me to take a long-distance flight. He thought for a moment and said:</p>
<p>"I advise you to make a maximum altitude flight in advance, do you agree?"</p>
<p>"I agreed."</p>
<p>In September 1936, the commander called me and told me that I could make a maximum altitude flight to test the maximum altitude of the aircraft.</p>
<p>I drove the "Fenda" seaplane, I paused at an altitude of 30,000 feet for 19 minutes, the plane could still rise higher, but I didn't dare to go to its limit. When I landed, Officer Jiagen congratulated me,</p>
<p>You have flown higher than any woman in the world, he said.</p>
<p>My husband, who is also a squad leader, has also reached a great altitude, but I have surpassed him, surpassed everyone in our group. In this exercise, I reached 23,000 feet without an oxygen device.</p>
<p>In May 1938, my teammates Fulan, Lomaga and Malinovskaya and I made a non-stop flight from Moscow to Va, establishing a national women's long-distance flight record, flying around the ring in our seaplane, we flew one thousand and ninety-three two miles.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1938, we made another non-stop flight, from Sebasto to Akan, covering one thousand seven hundred and seven miles in ten hours and thirty-three minutes.</p>
<p>These records were created in the Aviation Games Committee, creating two all-Soviet women's flight records, straight-line flights and curved flights.</p>
<p>Under the orders of Lenin and the awards of the government, Lomaga and I both received the rank of captain. Skovalev was also promoted to electrical captain.</p>
<p>I will never rest on my laurels. I will continue to work hard, flying to higher altitudes and longer distances. (End)</p>
