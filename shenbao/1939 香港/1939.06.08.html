<h3>青年怎樣實現戰時任務（下）</h3>
<p>— 西安特約航信</p>
<p>我們得到的第五個敎訓，就是，組織的發展要經通一定的階段，一般來說，一個組織在開始發展的時候，首先要團結積極分子，依　積極分子來團結廣大羣衆，廣大羣衆的組織，　初的政治性組織常要弱些，以後才逐漸加强，成爲比較高級的組織。地方性的組織，經過發展可以逐漸成爲全國性的組織。不統一的組織，經過發展可以逐漸成爲統一的組織。任何組織，必然都是要經過複雜的演變的；反過來說，不經過複雜的演變，要想一下子建立一個理想的組織，是不可能的。</p>
<p>我們得到的第六個敎訓，就是組織的發展要與抗戰形勢的發展密切配合起來。戰區組織的發展要比較非戰區順利些，因爲在戰爭中軍隊和政府對於靑年的需要增加了，靑年對於組織的需要也增加了。有些地方，本來是什麽靑年團體也不准組織的，因爲×人一來，形勢一吃緊，靑年的工作團，服務團，自衛軍，游擊隊，什麽組織鄱組織起來了。</p>
<p>我們得到的第七個敎訓，就是，組織的發展要與一般羣衆運動的發展，密切的配合起來。我們靑年是羣衆運動的先鋒，所以我們不但要做靑年工作，還要去組織一般的羣衆，這是一方面。另一方面，我們靑年也需要得到一般羣衆運動的帮助，才不致陷於孤立；並且有很多時候，尤其在鄉村中間，假如我們的長輩不帮助我們，我們的工作就很難進行。所以靑年運動和一般羣衆運動必需有適當的聯繫。</p>
<p>我們得到第八個敎訓，就是，在組織的發展中從上而下的方法和從下而上的方法必需密切的聯合來起。在順利的和可能的條件之下，自上而下的方法有很大的作用，如果這時僅僅由下而上去發展組織，得不到上層的帮助，一定要碰到困難；但是僅僅由上而下，完全採取命令成立，命令加入的方法，更沒有發展的希望。卽使發展，也必然不能鞏固，不能有力量。</p>
<p>有很多的靑年團體，有辦公的機關，有辦公的經費，但是成年成月的沒有實際工作。也有些靑年團體只有委員沒有會員，因爲會員都做了委員。這不但如此，有些團體的委員和幹事還不是會員，或者連究竟是不是會員他們自己也還不清楚，因爲他們只記得拿薪水，旣沒有入過會，更沒有開過會，當然也沒有退過會。也許他們入過會了，也許他們開過會了，但是這是不由自主的；在這種情形之下，他們不能宜佈退會，他們只能用消極怠工來表示他們實在只是被聘請來的名譽會員。</p>
<p>這不是笑話，而是人人看得見的事實。這就是因爲這些團體沒有注意到由下而上，沒有注意到民主自願的原則。這樣的團體只是一塊招牌和一塊徽章，而招牌和徽章是旣不能杭戰，也不能建國。</p>
<p>爲要組織最廣大的靑年來共同抗戰建國，我們不但要研究我們在組織工作裏的經驗與敎訓，而且要研究我們領導工作裏的經驗教訓。一個組織能不能發展，固然要看我們組織青年的方法，但要是有了好的組織，有了好的方針和决議，而沒有好的領導來保證它們的實行，這個組織還是要瓦解的。</p>
<p>怎樣才算好的領導呢？</p>
<p>第一，要實行集體領導和個人負責。一切工作都要經過會議討論，照大多數所通過的意見實行。「三個臭皮匠，賽過諾葛亮。」經過大家的商量，我們的工作佈置一定要週到得多。工作旣然决定了，就要分配各人來分頭負責，我担任我的，你担任你的，同時大家還要互相照顧和照顧全體，這就是叫做分工合作</p>
<p>第二，要有計劃。工作要有一定的步驟和一定的中心，不要陷於混亂的所謂事務主義的狀態。正如騎馬一定要牽住繩，我們的工作也一定要按照計劃，抓住中心，才能够有頭緒。</p>
<p>第三，要有檢查。單單有計劃，不能保證計劃的完成，一定還要有定期的會議，經常的巡視，來督促計劃的執行，研究執行中間有沒有困難，有沒有錯誤。如果一個組織的範圍包含很廣大的地區，領導機關就非有巡視員不可。巡視員的任務不是要去機械的下命令，或是故意去吹毛求疵，而是要幫助下級去解决困難。幫助下級也不是代替下級，一定還要注意到培養下級獨立工作的能力，發揮下級的創造性，機動性和積極性。</p>
<p>第四，要有自我批評。我們檢查我們的工作，一定會發現工作中的優點和缺點，這時就需要認眞的，大胆的批評。我們應該亳不掩飾我們的缺點，不但要有從上而下的批評，還要有從下而上的批評。但是我們的批評，不是打擊，而是爲了帮助和敎育，所以我們的批評不應該過火；不應該只看到缺點，還要看到優點，發揚這些優點；更不應該只是消極的批評還要指出積極的辦法。</p>
<p>最後，也是最重要的，就是要實行眞芷的民主集中制。一方面要民生，重要的意見，都由大家商量考慮决定，大家都來參加討論，共同負責；一方面還要集中，就是少數對於多數一定要服從，大家對於大家選出的領導機關和大家通過的决議，也一定要服從。所謂極端民主化，就是無論什麽時候，無論什麽事情，都要大家先來討論，少數對於多數的决定，或者下級對於上級的决定，有什麽意見，就不執行，這樣勢必使工作陷於停頓。組織就要渙散，民主也就談不到了。有了民主，也不是說不要紀律，紀律是必要的，並且也是敎育方法的一種。不過紀律也不能過於苛刻，不能濫用　了。</p>
<p>一切的組織織作和領導工作都要有人來做，這種人就是幹部。有沒幹部我們這所說明的就是空談，因此說：「幹部决定一切」。</p>
<p>我們靑年運動需要各種各樣的幹部。我們要軍事的幹部。要政治的幹部，要能埋頭苦幹的幹部，要會宣傳，會演說寫文章的幹部，要善於交際，善於統一戰綫工作，善於體育　樂工作的幹部。凡是有一技之長的，都可以成爲我們的榦部。</p>
<p>我們育年運動的幹部，應該是這樣的一種人：他們是忠實於民挨解放事業的，他們是能接近靑年，得到靑年的信仰的－他們是不怕負責，不說空話而能實際工作的；他們是安於職守，不是整天三心二意，不顧及工作的重要的，他們應該很活潑，因爲活潑是靑年工作的重要條件之一：他們還要能不斷向工作學習，在工作中改正錯誤，提高自己的認識。</p>
<p>因爲抗戰形勢和靑年運動形勢的迅速開展，這些舊的幹部，漸漸感覺到不能很好的適應新的工作條件，因此我們的幹部迫切需要一番從新的訓練。我們幹部需要充份了解靑年統一戰綫的工作方式，尤其是在鄉村靑年中間的工作方式。我們的幹部應該好好的把××××區，××××區，華北和其他各戰區的農民工作的一切經驗總結一下，把只往學生在晨民工作中的一切經驗總結一下。我們的幹部，應該好好地的向鄉村靑年學習，要能熱悉他們全部的生活，更要努力培養大批新的鄉村靑年的幹部。此外，我們需要注意到靑年幹部的專門化，注意到各個地區各個階層的幹部的互相調　，提倡部中間互扣學習的風氣，這也是我們的工作目前所迫切的要求的。</p>
<p>我們需要侵良的幹部，更需要正確的幹部政策。</p>
<p>我們要善於認識幹部，幹部沒有十全十美的，也决不會是一個模型裏說出來的。我們只要能看到幹部的各方面，用他的長處而克服的短處，就會發現人人可用。否則我們就會發現人人都不可用。</p>
<p>我們善於使用幹部。要從實際工作中，就政治上來提拔幹部，不要輕於提拔和調動幹部，使幹部不能勝任，不能安心，要信任幹部，並且要使幹部信任自已：一定的指示和檢查是必要的。但是决不要事事都去過問他。使他失去自動的信心。</p>
<p>我們要愛　幹部。要經常的幫助幹部，幹部有了錯誤，千萬不要將它誇大起來，監用嚴重的名詞使他感覺到恐慌和心理上的壓迫，還要注意到幹部的工作情緒和生活上的正當需要。</p>
<p>我們要團結幹部。思想的一致是團結的基本條件。問題彼此要多多商討，在商討之前要好好考慮，準備得愈充分，思想愈遇到，意見愈容易接近。商討的態度要謙虛，要客觀，要寬大，要能互相設身處地，要能捨小異而就大同，這樣卽使致生了什麽不同的意見·也不致各趨極端，不致妨害基本的原則上的一致，不致影響到幹部的團結。</p>
<p>我們有了正確的組織方法和領導方法，有了優良的幹部和正確的幹部政策，我們中國靑年就一定能够完成我們的組織任務，因此也一定能完成我們的政治任務。</p>
<p>因爲我們中國靑年，是在同一的環境中向着同一個目標奮鬥，所以我們不但担負着同樣的組織任務，而且在我們全部的組織工作中間，還應該並且能够一致貫串着同樣的工作精神，同樣的作風。</p>
<p>我們的作風，首先應該是堅定的政治立場。我們的立場，也就是中國靑年共同網領，就是堅待擁　持久抗戰×××××，擁護國民政府和蔣委員長，擁護三民主義和抗我建國網領，擁護全國靑年在這些原則之下，不分黨派，階層，性別，種族，民主自願的親密團結起來，結成偉大的統一戰綫（鼓掌）我們的這種立場，是無論如何處動搖的；無論什麽人要是企圖用威脅利誘來搖動我們的立場，我們就要他認識我們中國靑年偉大的力量。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>我餓的作風，其次應該是靈活，進取，實際主義因爲我們的立場必需要在日常工作裏異體化，我們不數迎空想家和空談家，我們要的是脚踏實地埋頭苦幹，我們不歡迎空洞的名詞和空虛的公式，我們要的是冷靜週密的思想，具體的切實的分折情况，解决問題。</p>
<p>我們的作風應該是艱苦奮鬥的。因爲我們的工作必然不是簡簡單單容容易易的，那樣我們的理想就早已實現，無熱乎我們來工作了。我們要百折不撓的奮鬥到底，我們要隨時隨地的準備着遇到困難克服困難，遇到障礙　除阻礙，我們要隨時隨地的準備着爲民族的解放和靑年的解放而犧牲一切。</p>
<p>我們的作風應該是民主的。因爲只有民主才能團結廣大的靑年來共同奮鬥，只有民主才能消滅成見，了解全面的眞理，克服關門主養，發揚靑年的積極性，暴　和孤立羣衆的×人，我們的靑年團體現在最缺乏民主，我們的國家現在也最需要民主，因肚我們靑年更加要提倡民主，幫助促進我們的整個國家定上民主政治的道路。</p>
<p>我們的作風應該是靑年化的。因為我們自己是青年，要們的任務是團結靑年，是爲了靑年的利益來奮鬥的，我們的行動要活潑勇敢，充滿朝氣，我們要熱習體育娛樂工作，要能講靑年能够　的話，能做靑年喜歡的事，要發搗靑年的一切美德。</p>
<p>我們青年特別是應該學習。我們已經說過，青年是學習的時代，青年的天然任務就是學習，只有不斷的學習能使我們不斷的進步，而我們不斷的進步，正是我們的一切工作所必需的。我們中國靑年的任務是很繁重很艱鉅的，因此，我們的努力學習是有决定的意義。</p>
<p>我們就是要拿這樣的作風，拿這種努力學習的精神來執行我們的組織任務。我們相信，全中國靑年的精神都是和我們一致的；我們並且以爲，只有這樣，才不愧爲今日中國的靑年。</p>
<p>我們中國靑年因爲有這種精神，對於我們民族空前的危難毫不愴　失措，我們完全相信將來，因爲我們完全相信自己。我們更相信我們偉大的祖國。</p>
<p>我們已經受過祖國深長的恩惠，我們相信我們的祖國今後一定會繼續的愛護我們，扶持我們；我們希望我們的民族領袖，合政黨的領導者，各軍，政長官和各界先進人士能繼續領導我們前進。他們一定會領導我們的，我們靑年也一定不會辜負他們領導的。我們將献出我們純潔而熱烈的心血，爲抗戰勝利奮鬥到底，爲獨立自由幸福的三民主義共和國奮鬥到底！</p>
<h3>青年怎樣到鄉村去？</h3>
<p>— 西安特約通訊馮文彬講</p>
<p>第一個問題：鄉村工作有什麽特殊的意義呢？</p>
<p>我們曾說，抗戰形勢的發展，使我們大多數的重要城市都被×人佔了，因此我們今後的工作就不得不以鄉村爲中心。所謂以鄉村爲中心，當然不是說就把城市工作放鬆了。我們後方還有許多城市，這些城市裏還有幾百萬靑年的學生，工人，店員，職員，需要我們去組織，去團結，去敎育，去動員。但是更大部分的靑年現在是在鄉村裏，這却是一個事實。</p>
<p>我們能不能依靠我們的的村來戰到×人的城市呢？能够的。第一，中國本來是一個落後的國家，城市在中國不能代表一切，×人佔了我們的許多城市，不能制我們的死命。第二，中國是一個領上很廣　的國家，×人的兵力不可能把我們的鄉村都佔領，都封鎖，就是我們後方的城市，×人也不可能都拿去。第三，也是最要的條件，就是中國有革命的階級，革命的政黨，革命的軍隊和人民，這些力量，使我們的鄉村不但歐和美的鄉村不同，不但和小國的鄉村不同，就和八國聯軍時代的中國鄉村，也完全不同。</p>
<p>鄉村工作有許多困難，這是不可否認的，鄉村一般總是比較散沒，不集中，封建勢力和封建思想比較濃厚，鄉村居民的頭腦要保守些，眼光往往只放在自已一家的日常小事情上文化程度很低，普遍的亡國，並且生活也最是痛苦，負担常常很不合理，加上日本帝國主義的瘋狂，他們的痛苦格外嚴重了。正因爲這許多困難，所以鄉村工作也就特別落後，特別需要我們的加緊努力。</p>
<p>第二個問題：我們要怎樣在鄉村進行工作呢？</p>
<p>一，要進行鄉村的靑年工作，首先要了解它是與一般農民工作不可分離的，因爲鄉村中間的封建思想比較濃厚，靑年農民的地位很低，靑年婦女不必說，所以要在他們和她們裏面進行工作，就不能不先從壯年和老年的宣傳組織着手。此外，十五，六歲以上的鄉村靑年，往往都是已經結了婚，在生產上負了很重要的責任的，所以他們的生活和一般成人的生活實在也相差不遠，因此，鄉村靑年工作和一般的農民工作格外有密切的關係。因爲這樣，我們後面說到鄉村工作的時候，也就不一定特別提出鄉村靑年來了。</p>
<p>其次要注意農民化。知識分子對於農民生活隔得太遠，所以下鄉去最大的難關就是不能農民化，過去中國有一個著名的農民運動的領袖，他原是一個大地主家裏的少爺，又是留學生，跑到鄉下穿着西裝就站在桌子上向農民講演，起初還有些人聽，後來竟愈來愈少了，他得了這個敎訓，就穿了農民衣服，住到農民中間去，幣農民解决許多日常的問題，這樣才逐漸取得了農民的信仰。從這假故事，我們可以看到農民化的重要了。所謂農民化，就是要穿農民的衣服，說農民說的話，起居飲食都要和農民打成一片，尤其要懂得農民的風俗習慣，對於男女關係和迷信問題上，尤其要注意，不要讓農民看不慣，對於農民的勞動生活他們固有的政治觀念，也要研究得淸淸楚楚這樣才不致引起相互間的隔閡和懷疑來。</p>
<p>有些靑年跑到農民家裏，農民很親熱的倒了茶給他們喝，他們看見茶碗實在太髒了，就推辭不喝；請他們坐，他們要拿出手帕來在凳子上拂了又拂；這樣農民自然就不樂意了。城市的靑年用面盆洗腳不算一囘事，住在農民家裏也就用農民的面盆洗起脚來，農民可恨極了，　這些靑年，枉續了幾年書，連人身上下的分別都不知道。城市的靑年對於字紙也是不大注意的，隨隨便便就用了擦屁股，農民看了更覺得這些靑年眞不成人樣。農民的風俗習慣各地不同，言語更是各地不同，因此麻煩更多。有些話在這裏很平常，或者還算是客套，在那裏說了却是駡人，說得不當心，農民可以跟你打架。南方稱人老板是客氣。在華北有些地方却是指開妓院的，由此可見，要做到農民化的確並不容易。</p>
<p>再其次，要經過適當的媒介和橋樑。我們初到鄉村和鄉村的羣衆彼此都不認識，所以爲要接近他們，一定要先經過一些在鄉村裏有威信的被大家所尊重的人，比方河南的老婆劇團就是經過了當地一位有威望的婦女。或者是經過鄉村的知識分子，特別是小學教師。中國的小學敎師一般的生活很痛苦，年齡都比較輕，政治認識都比較淸楚，所以抗日情緒都很高，他們在鄉村中間，因爲敎育當地羣衆的子弟，並且常能代群衆寫信解决疑難，很容易受羣衆的信仰，所以經過他們來接近羣衆，對於工作的幫助很大，或是絆過農民中間的積極分子，經過農民自己的領袖，這些人大概是身體强健聰明伶俐，平時好活動，能講話，有點主張的人；有些人怕這些人和鄉間的流氓混淆起來，其實兩者之間的區別是顯然的，因爲流氓游手好閒不務正業，因而不能得到羣衆的信任和愛戴的；或者是經過親屬朋友同鄉同學的關係；如果沒有這些關係，就結拜乾兄弟：乾姊妹乃至乾爸乾嫣也可以。</p>
<p>爲了接近農民，我們還需要選擇適當的時機，和利用適當的方式，鄉村的廟會和市集是最能號召羣衆的，這個時候來進行工作當然有許多方便。農民忙碌的時候最好去幫助他們一同勞動，山東有些靑年組織了一個農村　擊隊就是白天帮助農民割麥，而曉上去和農民談話，通俗的　術，無論是圖畫？歌曲和戲劇，　能夠最引農民，尤其是靑年和兒童，有時也可以經過他們進而去搜近他們的父母；開辦小規模的學校，施送簡單的　　，對於接近農民也有很大的效力。</p>
<p>第三個問題，怎樣去組織鄉村的靑年和一般民衆呢？</p>
<p>鄉村中的組織工作，一般的說來形式要力求簡單，要能够適應鄉村環境，這要連合農民切身的需要，比方說：能够對他們的耕種收獲有好處，就容易受到他們的歡迎。</p>
<p>在障礙少的時候，建立新式的，比較嚴密的組織，如農民救國會，靑年救國會之類，不過分組和開會的方法也要靈活，不要使農民覺得拘束勉强。否則也可以採用舊式的組織，迷信的組織，在農民中間現在還有相當的基礎，我們應加入進去工作，不應該打神駡鬼，因爲那樣並不能破除迷信，只是增加農民對我們的憎恨。我們在這些迷信組織裏要首先注重爭取它們的領袖到抗日的路上來。爲要得到他們的信任，我們要能和他們打成一片，燒香拜佛，什麼事都要耐心的做。河南有個靑年團體就是用這類方法，和他們建立了很親密的聯繫，後來才把他們的組織完全引導成爲救亡的力量。</p>
<p>鄉村中的婦女工作，應該由女同志來做，由年老的婦女入手就更好，婦女組織需要一些過渡的形式做準備，比方先動員她們識字，念抗日經，替戰士縫衣服，洗衣服等等，然後再組織她們就方便些。做鄉村婦女工作，要特別注意到鄉村的風氣，比方不提出反對家庭來縛的口號，而要提倡家庭和睦，同是一樣的內容，但是前者會引起家長的反對，而後者就不會，有些地方鄉村中間的妙女很多，我們若是從她們着手組織婦女，一定不能成功，也是同樣的道理。</p>
<p>在鄉村中進行兒童工作，也要注意到家長的態度，有些地方的家長生怕他們兒童也要去當兵，所以就反對抗日兒童團的組織。但是把抗日兩個字去掉他們就不反對了；當然這不是普遍的情形，却可以供給我們的參攷。兒童的組織還要適合兒童的興趣，要特別活潑，譬如敎他們上課，就要上上課，唱唱歌，敎他們軍事就要他們練習爬山冲鋒，放哨，其他的工作也是一樣。</p>
<p>第四個間題：有了組織，怎樣來開展鄉村工作呢？要在鄉村中開展工作一定要注意到鄉村中的上下層統一戰綫，要經過上層，經過保甲長，聯保主任或有力的紳士，這樣才可以得到各方面的便利，在工作中間，一方面要努力協助政府的動員工作，一方面也要注意適當的經過統一戰線來改善鄉村靑年和一般羣衆的生活，尤其注意認眞改革抽壯丁的辦法，認眞執行優待抗日軍人家屬等法令，這樣下層的工的工作才好進行。很多的地方因爲抽壯丁抽得不公平，貪汚舞弊，或者對壯了種種虐待不但妨害了動員工作，甚至還會激起民變來，和這相反，晉察冀的廣大軍隊工作不但過經了許多事前的宣傳解釋，並且還實行了種種優待抗日軍人家屬的辦法。晉察冀的抗日軍人家屬，兒童見了就向他們行禮。靑年組織經常帮助他們打柴，挑水，耕田，割麥子，不但抗日軍人家屬非常高興，戰士們也非席高興，動員工作因此也就很順利的開展了。其次還要汪意到發展鄉村靑年和一般羣衆的互助活動和生產活動。要多辦合作社。要多辦鄉村夜校，識字班，訓練班，那樣來提高他們的敎育，最後，對於建立和整頓各種鄉村半軍事組織，更要特別注意，要是在戰爭中間，這末建立游擊隊，開展游擊爭戰，就爲鄉村工作的唯一中心。</p>
<p>第五個問題：知識靑年到鄉村中間去的問題</p>
<p>知識靑年現在黨要由城市轉向鄉村，而鄉村也需要知識靑年，爲什麽？因爲知識靑年是鄉村工作的先鋒隊。對於鄉村靑年工作是如此，對於鄉村一般羣衆工作也是如此；本地出身的知識靑年固然是如此，外來的知識靑年也還是有很大的作用。知識靑年雖然也有他們的弱點，因爲不大了解和習慣鄉村的生活，但是决不能抹煞他們的優點，就是他們的社會關係多，政治認識強，所以容易接近鄉村中的各界人士，容易開展農村中的統一戰綫。</p>
<p>知識靑年到鄉村中去有幾種辦法。可以經渦農村服務團，同鄉工作團等長朋的或短期的組織來工作，可以經過抗×後援會，犧盟會一類組織來工作，可以經過民衆學校鄉村敎育促進會，農村合作社一類組織來工作，更好的是經過保甲，社訓隊，自　隊一　軍政機構來工作，如果能夠在裏面担任一些重要的職務，有了相當的地位，工作起來目然順利得多，不過無論如何，總要能够切實，艱苦，有耐心，能持久，在生活上更處處以身作則，不但要和鄉材靑年打成一片，還要做他們的模範，得到他們的信仰，這樣才能够眞正成爲鄉村工作的幹部。</p>
<p>知識靑年在村工作的一般過程，普通是由宣傳進入組織，到組織工作相當發展的時候，靑年農民的幹部就逐　產生出來，而知識靑年就成了比較高級領導者在這裏我們要反對兩種傾向：一種是看不起農村青年，以為鄉村青年沒有知識，不能組織工作的幹部；一種是看不起知識青年，以為知識青年不能起先鋒作用，不能做鄉材靑年的倡導者。這兩種傾向都是不對的。我們决要用各地活生生的事實，就足把够它們打得粉碎了。</p>

<p>小評</p>
<h3>法幣價格起伏</h3>
<p>昨天法幣價格突降，市場頗爲震動，在事實眞相未明之際，各方不應妄加揣測，徒自驚擾。不過，我們在這裏應有以下兩點基本認識：</p>
<p>第一，這次法幣突降，顯然是日×破壞我金融的陰謀的反響。如近偽華興銀行大舉從淪陷區吸收法幣，套換外匯，以致外匯突見短少，卽爲一例。可是我們政府對於穩定法幣，早有正確政策，並得友邦一致贊助，這次法幣下跌，可以說是早在政府預計之中，正不必代政府「鰓鰓過慮。」</p>
<p>第二，日×漢奸破壤我金融的陰謀已經遭遇無情的囘擊，日×漢奸一面旣不能對我法幣有所危害，已如上述，另一方面則日幣價格亦連日續跌，上週每一日圓僅值法幣九角四分，昨天已跌至九角二分，這裏可見日本的困難，却有不能挽救之勢。</p>
<p>我們對於此事，除了堅定擁護政府抗戰維持法幣的信念以外，一面要加緊我對英美的友誼，一面還應加倍努力從各方面打擊日×漢奸汪派的活動。</p>
<h3>航委會紀念週　毛邦初報告</h3>
<p>— 糜浪萍</p>
<p>新空軍之成長　由勝利的相持進到勝利的反攻　二期抗戰中已克復了已往缺點　第八器材庫長楊景曾轉述</p>
<p>【本報桂林特訊】月前第八航空器材庫楊庫長景曾，因要公來桂，記者探得此來是爲了執行當前中國空軍急需的兩大任務，同時，也知道他最近在重慶參加過航委會擴大紀念週，因此，記者在結東了聽講之後，冒雨趨其寓所訪問。</p>
<p>楊庫長曾留美十年，對中國航空器材整理配備方面，有過不少功續的，</p>
<p>他先把眼鏡擦一擦，然後明朋自然地說：『在重慶最近這次航委會擴大紀念週上，毛副總指揮（邦初）特別指出，今後「新中國空軍的新動向」。並有詳盡的分析。這點，我可擇要來談談：毛副總指揮大意這樣說：「第一中國空軍在一期抗戰中誠然能充分表現中國空軍的長成果敢，與忠勇犧牲的精神；但現在我們深深覺得：僅僅這些表現，而脫離了息息相關的各種重要配備，還是不够的。枕州，南京，武漢，廣州，及南昌各處，雖曾創作了一點起碼應有的記錄，但這儘單純地表露在空中戰鬥人員的技術和血氣問題，也可說是×人空中戰鬥人員的怯弱怕死所致（我們當然也有怕死怯弱的，但究屬少數）。至于空中戰鬥工具——飛機——的窳蘊（也有少數趕得上×人的）；油彈的來源困難，不够分配；機場的設備不良；地面空軍戰鬥人員的還欠努力認眞；以及製廠修廠戰時工作效率的未能切實增加；航空器材的接濟發生恐慌；下層政治工作推進力的不够；一切管理設備的不合規定；還有其他各方面的小缺點也很多。這些都是足以减少一期空戰收獲的最大缺點。」</p>
<p>楊庫長說時，非常激昂而又非常惋惜，因爲他是地面空軍戰鬥人員之一。他自己雖然用盡力埋頭苦幹，但尚不能滿足實際的要求，所以他說：「要兌現二期抗戰的新紀錄，非加緊努力不成的！」</p>
<p>他喝了一口茶，皺一皺眉，略略思考了一下，又朗聲說了：「記得毛副總指揮這樣繼續着說：「第二，新中國空軍在二期抗戰中，已有新的動向了。我們已經找出更多過去失敗的敎訓，而這些敎訓，就是我們過去所忽略的一期抗戰中各部門沒有做到，而且來不及做到的缺點。現在不同了，我們已經克服上述一期中的各大缺點，我們已實際地去盡量彌補，盡量改正了。（舉例來說；我們今後空中戰鬥工具，能超過×人飛機的高低空速，並橾縱靈敏，火力加强。油彈庫的數量增加了，且若手訓練專門管理人材，和特別注重于西南和西北的交通運輸。地面空軍戰鬥人員的大量擴增，單就機械技術人員來說，已由幾千人增至幾萬千人，且加緊外國考察留學，認眞與努力方面，已自發自覺地做到和改正。航空工廠與每月修理數量，也大大增加了。製造廠雖沒添增，而已能作進一步的仿造自給，各種機身由每週出若干架增加若干架。航空器材庫也增加了，並已增設越緬轉運機關，以及電動加油車。空運飛機及汽車的大量購增，工作時間的增長，效率的展開，政治工作的推展迅速，甚至各種設備的已積極改善，雖因戰區擴大，而略有變化，但這些都是已成的事寔，我們認爲發揚勝利獲得的經驗也同樣重要幷從克服和改正缺點做去，還是不够的，加緊空中各部門戰鬥人員的招考和訓練，戰鬬技術的積極加强和改善，與夫忠勇犧牲精神的發揚光大，這些也是擺在我們眼前的鐵的事實，所以二期抗戰的新中國空軍，也隨着戰局的移轉與時代的需要，而走上了新的途徑。也可以說，由勝利的相持時期，進到勝利的反攻時期，是新中國空軍更活躍，更努力，更艱苦的時期。我們得認淸戰局，把握戰局，認淸使命的重大，與任務的艱巨，更須認淸自我忠勇犧牲精神。現在正是不可多得的大好兌現機會，凡我空軍人員，特別應以最大决心與信念，去創造更新的紀錄！」</p>
<p>楊庫長說到這裏，突然停止下來，看一看手鏢說：『已十一點卅五分了，本來還有很多關于空軍與抗戰的重要來談，但限于時間，好在見面機會很多，留在下次再談吧。』最後他說：『我們要平心而論，是不是對得起國家民族和自己的良心！』（救亡社約）</p>

<h3>謁佛教聖地塔爾寺（下）</h3>
<p>— 君邃</p>
<p>我們出了殿門卽見有古樹一株，用木柵欄圍住，盤根錯節，姿態蒼老據說係「旃檀樹」，宗喀巴的胞衣卽埋於樹下，並謂樹枝皮膚透明，內現藏文經句，則不過古老傳說而已，其左爲一神殿，內列神像作男女相對擁抱狀聞神之藏名爲『交」，與從前在北平雍和宮所見的一樣，北平人均呼爲歡喜佛，有以專爲指示小皇帝使知性交的姿態者，亦係無稽之談。據聞此爲密宗的神祗，大約取「見怪不怪，其怪自敗」的意思吧。從該殿旁邊上樓則見喇嘛佾分二排，盤足而坐，口誦繼頁卽朗朋可聽，經買的紙極堅厚，聞係西藏所產，形如腰帶，長約二尺，闊約六寸，兩面印刷經文，四週圍以黑綫，可與宋版媲美。再入一室，則見老喇嘛僧手持鐘磬之屬，隨敲隨念，聲振屋瓦。其左爲班禪乘坐之寶興，形如上海舊時的馬車，惟全車漆以黃色，車墊均用黃緞，因已上鎖、故未明視，下樓後冉上雲梯。一覽屋頂金飾，有如塔形的，有如傘形的，也有如瓶形的，均係鋼裝鍍金，耀人眼簾。在屋頂上四望，見左面山上，崇樓連雲，矗立天際，知爲活佛行館，有如貴胄的甲第，活佛餐尊處優，誠不愧素王之尊了。山右爲喇嘛僧的住所，廣廈千間，鱗次櫛比，約可容五千人之居處。從屋頂右角俯　，見講經院前廣場中，喇嘛儈曆集研討經典，質問聲，對答聲，評判時的拍掌聲，旁聽者的附和聲，嘈雜喧嘩，分組辯論，無異學術團禮的座談會。由屋頂下來後，再參觀他們的廚房，中置直徑一丈大鐵鍋三只，旁置茶桶無數，聞係香會時煮茶分餉客之用。</p>
<p>參觀將畢二老爺卽邀往他們的公本吉哇，（卽辦公處）內休息進茶點至則所謂大老爺三老爺亦在座，殷勤招待，奉茶甚敬，他們有烘鍋塊形似麵包，有的其中加入乳油，味極可口，還有一種炒麵，猶南方的炒米粉，摻入乳油及糖，則頗難下嚥，茶味尚佳，惜加乳油及糖後，反覺乏味，我向敬茶的喇嘛僧索淸茶解渴，一飲可盡五六杯，因爲在日中跑了多時，已覺口渴難當，所以更覺茶味淸香。二老爺此時允將轉世的達賴喇嘛請出來給我們相見，我們在等這位未來的活佛的時候，隨便與二老爺等談天，承他們告訴我以塔爾寺的來源和他們的組織。他們設經律論三院純粹爲佛學研究機關，內真格喜一位（漢譯爲賢者）主持三院院務，下置法台一位，漢譯爲敎務長，專司敎育事宜，格奎一位（漢譯爲訓育長）專司管理全寺喇嘛的行爲倘違犯淸規，卽這皮鞭的鞭韃，鞭懸大金瓦殿側　，見之令人悚然，聞活佛小時亦由大法台敎以經典，徜有過失，亦可略施夏楚，但於施罰前，必須由敎授先行拜跪致敬，故小佛每遇敎授跪地時，部抖慄不知所措，實爲奇聞。移時一喇嘛背負小佛而來，詢之年僅四歲，聞其父嗜酒善騎，不事家人生產，其母則有夙慧，故小佛性格極伶俐，雖不諳漢語，然二老爺告以與我們握手爲禮，亳無尋常小孩子氣，我替他攝影，亦亳無畏縮的態度，二老爺有問，小佛卽對答如流，據二老爺告訴我們，達賴轉世係西藏拉薩三大寺派人四出訪問，凡淸海，西藏，西康三地的聰明兒童，能將活佛生前用具在倣製偽品中，由所選見童檢取眞品者，卽爲入選，唯三个小佛，仍須經過高級喇嘛僧的抽籤决定，故傳說有富家父兄納賄以求其子弟繼承活佛的弊病。</p>
<p>我們見了小佛。卽行告辭，仍搭汽車返寓，經寺內的小金瓦殿，下軍參觀，見殿高二層，銅頂鍍奎，與大金瓦殿互相　　，惟規模較大金瓦殿為小，但自成一局，建築也極其壯麗，內供佛像，猙獰可怖，膩油之氣，不可嚮邇，我們也沒有詳看、在小金瓦殿後面，有小山八座，相傳爲年賡堯征西時曾殺喇嘛儈八人於此，故建八塔以資紀念，實則佛敎以八種功德圓滿爲最高標的，佛寺前多建八塔以象徵八德，這種傳說，實屬無稽。途中見藏婦二人我請其攝影，卽承允諾，稍遠又值土人婦女四人，我亦以攝影相請，一婦卽忽促避去，幸經路人及同行的相勸，也荷同意，可見囘埃老婦小女，卽出攝影機向之攝影，也未遭拒絕，連日前在寓所承蒙古王公夫婦囑我攝影，計已得蒙囘藏土四族的影像，服裝各別，宗敎不同，生活方式亦相去甚遠，竟能雜居一地，相安無事，實爲難能可貴。</p>
<p>宗喀巴爲佛敎的革命家，與基督敎之有馬丁路德無異，因佛敎在十世紀前，卽由印度傳入西藏，至其末流，佾人以吞刀吐火等邪術惑世，煙酒××，無所不爲，一切淸現，淪陷已盡。至宗喀巴出世，始負起宗敎革命的使命，以釋迦的慈悲救世爲精神，以提倡淸净無爲，戒絕俗世嗜懲爲敎律。生於明永樂十五年，在西寧出世，歿於成化十五年，在西藏拉薩圓寂，死後經其門徒達賴，班禪及哲布丹巴等傳其衣鉨，努力募化，以建此塔爾寺，蒙藏人民對佛敎本極信仰，經宗喀巴的門徒們重　教律，於是衆仰所歸，使塔爾寺成爲東方佛敎第三聖地。凡蒙古人之信佛敎者，以一至塔爾寺爲終身大願，而靑海蒙藏人則以一謁西藏拉薩三大寺爲無上榮幸，而西藏的蒙藏人復以一朝釋迦聖地爲莫大福慧，亦不外『遠來和尚會念佛』的心理而已。</p>
<p>在我們的囘途中，不免想起許多問題，覺得一般人對於塔爾寺的誤解與錯覺，實爲不可思議，如謂他們的財產足以抵償庚子賠款而有餘，則以銅瓦鍍金視爲純金屋瓦所誤解。有謂活佛轉世能以靑海的候補者當選，朋外蒙西藏卽可歸附，則又認爲活佛還足以統治蒙藏的錯覺；又有以喇嘛敎非佛敎，及黑白紅黃四敎爲喇嘛敎的分派的，則不知嘲嘛卽活佛的藏譯，僅能視爲佛敎中的一派，並非在佛敎之外，另有喇嘛敎的存在，更無以顏色而分成敎派的理由，宗喀巴以前的西藏佛敎已至陳腐窳敗的地步，非有大刀闊斧的革命精神起而改革，則已同婦於盡，此則爲以新繼舊的宗派，而誤解作他們的敎名，也不可不辨明的。蒙截民族大多數人民數千年來仍度其游牧生活，民衆不識不知，根本沒有受敎育的機會，僅賴出家當了喇嘛儈，方有研習經典，得到識字求學的會，與歐洲中世紀學者皆被　養於經院相仿彿，在政府對蒙藏民族的生活與敎育尚未能普通改善以前，卽欲破除他們的宗敎信仰，也有過早的錯覺吧。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本是否馬上加入德意軍事同盟？</h3>
<p>今日的報紙載着關於日本外交政策的兩種相反的消息，其，據東京傳來的消息，蘇聯倘不捲入漩渦，則日本對歐也不願再訂條約：其二，據同一消息又稱：然有種種事件足以證明日本軍人正在極力圖使日本接近德意；甚至如「星島日報」上海事電稱：日本决將加入德意軍事同盟，三國復訂密約，內容爲德意各調一師團軍隊，以志願兵名義來華助日作戰，如一旦歐局變化，則日本亦可孤兵赴歐，補德意人力之不足</p>
<p>這裏會使讀者發生一種疑問：日本目前的外交政策，究竟是不是立刻走到簽訂德意日軍事同盟的階段，抑或爲時尚有待？這個問題自表面上看來，似乎只是對歐的外交問題，但事實上也就是他們內政分岐的問題，我們寧可說是日本侵華軍事促成的兩種不同勢力的鬥爭的反映。</p>
<p>我們相信在各國的勾心鬥角日益尖銳，世界大戰的危機日益成熟，而各國外交跑進同盟外交時代的今日，日本蠻幹冒險成性的少壯派軍人，當然竭力企圖促成德意日軍事同盟實現，以便擴大事勢而壓抑其國內的反對派。所以一方面日本在華軍隊頻頻造成對第三國的恐怖，排外排英運動，最近更由華北，華中，蔓延到華南來；另一方面駐歐洲的軍人，也在活動促使日本參加德意軍事同盟。</p>
<p>但依我們的觀察，事勢的發展還不至於如是急速。日本侵華軍事的停頓，碰壁，已使日本政界覺得對華政策確有重新改變或刷新一下的必要。單靠蠻幹，已不成功了。特別值得注意的，昨日日本內閣五相會議，通過了重臣會議所計劃用以應付歐局的政策，消沉多久的近衛前首相，現在又活躍起來，並且處處和西園寺元老聯結着關係。</p>
<p>從各種方面的情勢觀察，日本元老重臣派的確對於侵華戰事抱着極大的憂慮，他們是在千方百計地企圖及早結束戰爭。因此，他們主張對英美法討好，當然他們在目前也就不贊成率然加入德意日軍事同盟。論者或以爲少壯派軍人之借重於德意，目的也是在於及早結束中日戰爭，但須知道，德意兩個師團的志願兵並無多大的作用，况其結果適足以促成英蘇法的三角軍事協定，並會將反侵略範圍擴大到遠東。</p>
<p>最近，平沼內閣企圖與被遺棄的政黨「抱合」。民政黨竟也提出「革新」的主張，而右翼瘋狂者末次之流，却反瞠乎其後，我想自然不是偶然的罷！</p>
<h3>暹羅改國號　內閣議決改曰〔賽〕　將於本月廿四日提出</h3>
<p>【美聯社曼谷七日電】暹羅內閣會議、議决改國號曰『賽』、意卽自由之邦、又宣布此事在實行前須將憲法修改、方爲有效、本月廿四日爲暹羅『修約紀念日』改國號之動議將於同日提出國民會議、據暹羅國民黨員稱、現有之國名起源於東埔約寨、該地舊屬暹羅、現則爲印度支那之一部云、</p>
<p>關於暹羅改號</p>
<p>關於暹羅改號一事本港名醫盧覺非君　投函本報指出「賽」字譯爲『自由之邦』、係屬錯誤、特寫此文更正、並加引申云</p>
<p>考『賽』原文Thai舊譯『大』、係遷羅士著民族的稱謂、距今二千年前、自中國西南邊陲移入、散居湄南河流域一帶、這族自稱「大人」、觀其體格生活、頗似川滇的「擺夷」、未幾有由緬甸及暹羅西南部移入的「蒙」人Mons、和這『大』族競爭、千數百年來、湄南河畔、就成爲他們兩埃角逐爭雄的戰場、在暹羅東北部、山深林密的地方、有所謂「朽木」Khmirs人的、實是扶南（今法屬西堤岸古國名）眞臘（今法保護國、名柬埔寨）的遺民、最受「大」「蒙」兩族的賤視、至今兩族、還以和「朽木」人通婚、爲最可　之事、</p>
<p>選羅民族的構成、雖尚有不少其他份子、如華人、馬來人等、但仍以上述的「大」『蒙』「朽木」爲其骨幹、就中尤以「大」族較佔優勢云、</p>
<h3>英濳艇慘案　海相發表報告　盛讚遇難官兵榮譽　承造公司響應捐欵</h3>

<h3>世界的命運與遠東前途</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（三）從英國內部分野上看英德的再接近是更加渺遠了</p>
<p>誰都知道、英國內部親德的大集團、是代表金帥界、銀行資本家、貴族、封建地主利益的所謂「克利夫登集團」（Cliveden　Set）裏面、號稱健將的人物、是、現在外相的哈立法克斯、太晤士報主筆的道生（Dawson）、新任駐美大使的羅惜恩（Lord　Lothian）、以及觀寮報的主筆加爾文（Garvfn）等等、而尤其上面舉出名字的這幾位、向來是强烈的親德論者、現在呢、却一律變了論調、站到反德的立場上了、比這幾個人更可注意的、還是那一位身居「克利夫豋集團」東道主地位的觀察報主人的亞斯特爾（Astor）的改變態度、這位亞斯特爾、一向是被認爲德國外交在英國的義務代言人、現在呢、也公然地主張英國不能再讓步的論調了、這一切眞是一個大改變、</p>
<p>這些日子以來、張伯倫首相、不斷地在一條兩歧的路上徘徊、蘇聯呢、還是索性對德讓步到底、而每次從「克利夫豋集團」裏上述的這幾位人物那兒、他都和以前不同地、受到了絕對不再對德屈服的勸告、現在、剩下來還保留原來的立場、主張繼續親德論者的人物、比較引人注目一點的、似乎僅僅有一位現任張伯倫顧問的威爾生（Wilson）了、然而他的聲音、和全英國廣大的聯蘇的呼聲一比時、事實上、連蚊子的哼哼也似乎抵不上、</p>
<p>不過、這些、僅僅的是表示一種主要的趨勢、至於一涉及到實際各別問題時、究竟會怎麽表現、那當然又是另一個問題、比如、但澤的問題、到底怎樣呢？現在、誰也不敢預言英國到底會取什麽態度、德國方面、也知道『這些近來英國親德人士們態度的變更、所以、作爲挽救起見、上個禮拜、德國以「英國通」現任外長的里賓特羅甫、就派遺」他的親信吉爾（Baron　Gyr）來到了英國、從社交上、作種種的活動、這位吉爾一到了英國、立刻聚集所大有的在野的在朝的親德人士們、交換了許多意見、可是、所收效果呢、似乎並不大、而最大失敗、是他在李維諾夫去職後所散佈的德、蘇談判的消息、立刻被蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基鄭重地否認了、</p>
<p>祗要一看得到邁斯基大使否認後的哈立法克斯外相高興的情形、那末、英國今天怎麽切望和蘇聯接近和德國疏遠、是一目就可以了然的了、</p>
<p>（四）德意軍事同盟的正式宣佈和日本的半途退縮、</p>
<p>德、意軍事同盟的存在、已經不是一天、而最近的正式宣佈、也並沒有引起什麽驚異、不過、略略引起一點驚奇的、却是日本的半途退縮、照日本的立場看、這一着、對它自己、是非常不利的、已經一再宣稱要造「東亞新秩序」的日本、和已經强調向日本送過『最後意見』的美、英、法的維持九國公約的政策之間、事實上、已經是斷絕了妥協的餘地、難道已經打算自認失敗、準備放棄所謂「東亞新秩序」了嗎、</p>
<p>很明顯、這是並不然的、在今天的英國、流行的解釋、似乎祗有兩個（一）美國艦隊的開囘太平洋、（二）中國抗戰的成功、</p>
<p>據在此地得到的消息、原先、日本已答應派遣海軍到地中海來示威了、後來、看到了負着接洽責任意外長齊亞諾態度的强硬、日本忽然怕了起來、牠當然怕弄假成眞、和英、美、法眞開了戰、於是它來了一個躊躇、因此、鬧得牠駐意大使幾乎要忿而辭職、</p>
<p>不過、這也絕對構不成退出軍事同盟的理由、日本不敢和中、英、美、法蘇五國作戰、其實、德、意、在目前、又何嘗有幹的勇氣、</p>
<p>當然、英國還是想把日本從侵略集團專拆出來的不過、英國的對蘇對華的態度、却另有他的考慮、絕不是因爲日本這一舉、而有根本的變更、</p>
<p>日本這一舉、除去寒了德、意的心而外、其、他的影響、似乎很少、已經孤立了的地位、是更孤立了、僅僅從外交的運用上看、這對於牠自已、實在是非常無意義、非常手忙脚亂的一看、不過、從種鍾象徵看起來、這退縮、也祗有暫時的可能、如果牠不自認失敗、堅持要造什麽「東亞新序秩」、那末、大勢之所趨、縱使明知聯德意是冒險、牠也不得不終于被捲了進去、（完）</p>

<p>（一）本港大小工廠、數逾千家、報載工業區三處斷難容納、且現因戰事影響交通不便、建築物料甚爲缺乏、價格奇昂、短期間內實無法建設、或多量工廠供應原日工廠搬遷之用、（二）自行建築費小者三數萬、大則數逾十萬、且其內容必爲工廠式、一旦令其搬遷、則此後租賃於人、亦不適用、其損失將由何人負責、（三）現在已成立之工廠其建築費如水電之裝置、機氣之裝配、及一切人工木料等、小則需費三數千元、大亦爲數逾萬、倘一旦令其搬遷、則原日之建設費、旣須犧牲、復須重新再負一宗鉅大之建設費、除此以外、卽搬遷費一項、亦所需不資、殊非一般工廠所能負祖、（四）每一工廠之設立、當日必經政府批准在案、一日令其搬遷、在政府則未免有失威信、在工廠則損　無所取償、（五凡屬製造危險品之工廠、經於去年遵令遷往政府所指之危險區、（OTA）營業而報載工業區幷未將危險區列入、是則該項工廠於若此短速之時間內、又須一再搬遷工廠損失之鉅、固不堪言政府之朝令夕改、亦未免貽人口實且將使廠商今後無所適從、（六）本港開埠百年、幾成轉運商埠、今已　改舊觀、工廠增建、風起雲湧、將有成爲工業埠之可能、惟是我華人工廠資本微薄較諸歐美、奚啻天淵、是以政府當局、向應提携保護、俾資長成不宜律以苛嚴使其難堪、而阻碍本港工業之發展、否則來港從是工業者、勢將而之他、而本港繁榮、亦不無影響云、</p>
<p>轉請政府　延緩執行</p>
<p>上述各項均爲敝會同人反對遷往、報載工業區之理由、敬乞代向政府當局查詢真相、幷將下情代　、不勝感幸、至於設立工業區之議、竟至美善　但亦請政府採取緩進政策、對原有工廠准其一仍舊址、新設工廠、則須於指定工業設立、逐漸改良、庶不致有　政府威信、而原有工廠亦可不蒙巨大楨失、此則敝同人所願其愚誠者也、專此佈　敬頌鈞祺、香港中華廠商聯合會主席葉蘭泉啓、</p>
<p>政府未有　若何動議</p>

<h3>譚雅士昨日解釋　禁止九龍養豬原因　市區向外發展畜牧有碍衛生　政府施行取締事前曾加攷慮　新九龍及新界方面仍可繼續畜養</h3>
<p>衛生當局、定期本年九月卅日、實行禁止九龍牧戶養豬問題、引起當地數百牧戶之反應、日來延請律師及派出代表具呈當局呼籲、請求收回成命、以維生活、各情詳見報端、查衛生當局、自接據牧戶呈文後、發覺牧戶對於政府禁養牲畜內容、殊多誤會及不盡明瞭之處、同時該局華人議員譚雅士、周錫年、鄧肇緊、黃炳耀四氏、對于政府禁止九龍居民養豬及牧戶請求收回成命兩問題、曾干前（六）日下午、舉行一度會議、從詳研討、關于牧戶所誤會之點、衛生局主席托特、特委由華人議員譚雅士氏、向記者作詳盡解釋、用釋　疑、使政府施政進行上獲得便利、</p>
<p>連近市區　影響衛生</p>
<p>譚議員昨日接見記者時、首先解釋此次政府實行定期取締餐豬原因、謂年來本港各方面隨着時代進展、日見繁榮、尤其人口增加迅速、市郊逐漸向郊外擴展、尤以九龍方面、進步爲甚、往昔荒蕪之區、現目多已頓易舊觀、改爲崇樓大廈、而九龍牧戶、遂逐漸與市區接近、因畜牧一切牲口、其放牧糞溺及飼料種種問題與居民衛生、實有莫大之影響、政府當局、爲適應環境需求、對于市區之發展、實爲一不易之政策、關於居民衛生、允當有完滿之保障、而另一方面、則以九龍一帶牧戶、生斯長斯、在九龍有其深長歷史、一旦加以取締、則其生活上當發生影響、故關於取締問題、會作深長之攷慮、結果權衡輕重、終以遷移牧戶爲宜、爰有定期本年九月卅日實行取締之議、</p>
<p>禁止畜養　僅屬劃界</p>
<p>至將來實行禁養地點、非爲如報章所載、凡屬九龍地帶牧戶、卽須禁止、因其地域問題割分至爲淸晰、禁養區域、祗屬于　九龍方面、其範圍在界限街之南、在禁養地域內、牧戶無論已否領有牌照、居時一律不准拳養、當局最近亦已决定不再發給牌照、以爲實施取締之初步、至界限街之北、也屬新九龍區域、則于禁令實行之後、其已領有牌照者、仍可繼續豢養、牧口之持有舊牌者、亦可依期轉換新牌、但持牌人改業時、不能將牌照轉讓于他人、違者政府當將其牌照注銷、至新界方面、政府則未加限制、無論任何地區、皆可豢養牲畜、用爲九龍牧戶遷移之退步地位、</p>
<p>政府禁令　根據條例</p>
<p>譚氏並作進一步之解釋、謂政府此次執行禁令、係根據一九三五年公共衛生潔净則係例第十五條執行、該條例在一九三八年九月議决執行者、該條例又與衛生局之歷史、有相當關係、蓋在一九三八年前、市政衛生局、原爲潔净局、其後改組爲市政衛生局、經過此度改組後、所定則例、亦略有變更、自從一九三五年起、衛生則例第十五條關于畜牧方面、（包括畜養豬牛羊在內）亦曾作詳細之規定、舉凡養豬地方及星宇、其距離不得接近民居六尺、畜猪地點、其溝渠不得與私家或公衆溝渠接連一起、關于溝渠之建築材料、應以磚或石或曾經化騐准許之材料築成餐猪屋、光綫須極度充足、屋內地面以石塊鋪砌或用三合土或以不透水之原料敷塗、並須將溝渠引通至一水井、該水井亦須經當局認爲適當、然後方予批准、然對于此點、當局能察體情形予以通融辦理、</p>
<p>畜養地點　須加清除</p>
<p>關于蓄牛地點、則例中亦有規定凡每一隻牛所佔地方爲三十二方尺、並須有三百六十立方尺空氣圍、牛屋高度為十二尺、每一頭羊所佔有地方爲八方尺、有九十立方尺空氣圍二每一豬隻所佔有地方爲八方尺、猪屋最低高度爲四尺、又凡屬畜餐猪羊地方及屋宇每年應舉行大清除二次、屋內不得同時儲藏其他物品、領牌人倘非在本港居留者、萁全權代理人如遇牲畜發生時疫、必須負責向政府獸醫官衛生局或警署報告、如有牲畜病死時、不得擅自將之遷移、必須得獸醫官之批准、方可將之遷移或埋葬、領牌人如違犯上述則例、經兩次以上之處分時、當局有權隨時將其牌照取銷、</p>
<p>劃定地域　為畜牧區</p>
<p>無牌牧戶、必須在畜養牧畜附近、設備淸潔之水源、時將畜場洗刷、所養之牛或羊、不能擅自放出草場食草、至小羊及豬隻、則不在限制範圍之內、至豬牛羊之頭數分柝、則禾滿足一歲年齡之牛二頭、作一頭計、兩小羊或山羊或兩猪、其年齡在四月以下者作一頭計、最後譚氏謂、政府在實行取締九龍養猪之前、已劃定有五處區域招請牧戶投承爲畜牧地點、計（一）靑衣島、（二）馬　島、（三）荃灣、（四）葵涌、（五）新界、上述五地水源豐富、空氣充足、極適宜爲畜牧場所、九龍牧戶、大可向此中尋求新所在、實不須斤斤留意干舊場所也、又現在據當局之詳確調查、則九龍方面、未領有牌照之牧戶、約達三百家之多、而舊九龍約佔一百家、新九龍約佔二百家、故將政府實施取締時、所認爲發生困難者爲數僅此、舊九龍方面之未領牌照之一百家牧戶而已、對于社會一般問題、當不致發生若何重大影響也云云、</p>

<h3>傳影機在美國</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>各大城設傳影電臺</p>
<p>無綫電傳影運動、宣傳已久、終於在美國具體的實現了、美國現有十二個城市、設立傳影電台、播送各種節目、製造傳影機的工廠、也有六家之多、其在家庭間流行的程度日廣、預料不久有淘汰普通收音機的趨勢、</p>
<p>所謂傳影機、形狀和立地收者機彷彿、收音摟的天綫是在屋頂上繃、五十尺銅綫、但傳影機需要搭一個大篷帳、機前有玻璃一塊、長七寸半、闊十寸、一旁有葫蘆式陰極管一枚、電子由管中射出、映在玻璃上就成影子、</p>
<p>在開機的時候、必須室內無光、機上的兩鈕、一個控制聲音、一個調節光圈、這是指最完備的一種、卽售美金三百五十元的、另有一種有影而無聲的、僅值美金一百二十五元、映出來的景物雖不大、很淸楚、五六個人並坐在離機三四尺的地方、很可以看得滿意、</p>
<p>傳映機中的節目、側重最近發生的新聞、如英皇巡幸加拿大、地球上某處發生變故等等、或者播送當時所攝的景繃、或者用「表演」方法、把新聞情節敘　出來、其次是運動游藝等節目、趣味的劇本也是播送的中心、如福爾摩斯探案等、有時也在飛機上播送景物、使人恍如游歷天空一般、</p>
<p>傳影台的經費是很大的、因爲僅是一幕劇本、就需要許多間置景的暗室、和許多技師人工、英國播影台現時每日播節目一小時、政府按年津貼共百萬元左右、在美國各台、每星期搖影兩小時、經費由商人自己負担、他們預期將來發達後、傳影的廣告上可以賺囘、不過因爲技術還欠週到、電傳影戲的射程、只及于四十五英里之遙、將來必須改進、才可普及、</p>
<p>在播影台上的技術人員，都是特別經過訓練的。他們和銀幕上舞台上不同，因爲一本影片或舞台劇可以連做一年之久，傳影戲播送一次之後，就不再用，要繼續不斷的供給新鮮花樣。所以電傳影戲的展開，供給人們新的刺激，同時在藝術上也進一個新的時代。</p>
<h3>滬上銀海風最線</h3>
<p>藝華方沛霖演導『三集化身　娘』、全部竣事袁美雲在此集中以騎師姿態出現、甚見活潑、韓蘭根關宏達爲汪洋按摩、演出香艷滑稽、令人捧腹此片不久將公映、</p>
<p>天聲公司出品『紅花瓶』、爲前輩導演張石川傑作劇情苦透透逐、演員有王蘭舒適、王漢備、譚志遠、白燕等、</p>
<p>孫敬進藝華導演『香江歌女』、殊見努力、孫敬爲一新導演、而極喜用新人材、如岳麟、陶娜、嚴化、曹娥、均爲新進影界之新人、</p>
<p>王元龍編導兼主演之『燕子盜』、已成尾聲、有傳其將去香港、惟王本人表示、短期內暫不離滬、蓋新華邀彼客串一片之故、</p>
<p>王漢倫爲中國電影女演員中之開山鼻　富有演戲經驗、伊在「紅花瓶」片中飾王蘭之母、官太太降爲傭僕、演來聲淚俱下、不愧爲前輩影人、</p>

<p>張翠紅拒演「王寶釧」、藝華有邀請白　之　、綠白楊有將來滬之說、</p>

<h3>都非常重視　世界各國的兒童電影</h3>
<p>電影已被認爲補助兒童敎育的速成工具的一種、所以世界各國、目前對兒童影片已是非常重視、本月四日是兒童節、因此、筆者要把各國對於兒童影片重視的情形、略約地向讀者報道一下</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>美國是電影事業先進的國家、因此、美國的電影敎育也比任何邦國然進步、美國的學校、現在已有不少購置映影機、在每一個星期日或節日放映兒童影片、這種影片、有的由公家收集材料、編成劇本而特攝的、有的由影片公司攝成、專讓學校或敎育機關放映的、就是通常的電影院、公映含有兒童敎育意義的影片、凡是見童進去觀看、每把票價滅得非常便宜、</p>
<p>在傳統上、什麼都帶些守舊色彩的古老的英國、電影當然也不致例外、尤其是對於兒童影片特別注意、各地的電影檢查會檢查影片的時候、對於影片、每一部要冠上A字或U一宇、A字就是Adult的縮寫、祗准成人、不准兒童觀看的意思、U字是「Unievrsa」的縮寫、成人與見童一樣可進去觀看意思、近年以來英國更由國家設置專管兒童影片的機關、拍攝兒童影片、在各地的公共機關或學校裏面公映、</p>
<p>德意</p>
<p>德意兩個獨裁國家、對於兒童影片也很重視、但自法西斯蒂得勢而後、這兩個邦國、先後把電影事業加以統制、電影當做了宣傳主義的工具、政治作用重於娛樂意味、所以兒童影片也不是例外、由公家選擇了兒童影片的材料、攝成影片、有的是顯明的、有的是暗示的、把法西斯主義、國社主義、何傳兒童宣傳、而各電影院各學校、更時常有這種兒童影片的公映、</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>蘇聯電影事業的進步、有特殊的神速、是足使任何人表示驚奇的、尤其是對於電影敎育、非常注意、單就莫斯科說來、每一個例假的日子、有五百多家電影院、自上午九時它、到下午九時止、輪流公映兒童影片、票價的低廉、爲別國未所見、這些影片、包括正片、卡通片、由政府攝製、專門供給八歲以上、十六歲以下的兒童觀看的、在攝製方面、故事的取材、都以兒童爲對象、和普通的影片不同、</p>

<h3>從古代希臘談到奧林匹克運動會的種種</h3>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>希臘為歐洲文化的發源地、凡歐洲的宗敎、美術、哲學、敎育、工藝、科學等等、沒有一件不受希臘人的影響、這是興地理有關係的、試翻開歐洲的地圖一看、希臘不過是半個島、其地形很像是一隻手底骨骼、突出地中海有摘採各樣文化的種子之觀、北　以巴爾榦作當臂　、略較廣闊、而希臘的本部、南北二百五十里、東西百八十里、共約也不過二萬方哩的面精而巳、然因三面環海、而四季的氣候都　節得十分温和、單舉雅典的城市來說、在二十年中、降雪僅僅祇有一次　每年從五月到九月間、市民竟可在街上露宿、所以住屋、家具、衣服、都是很簡單樸素的、至於日常生活如耕作勞役、命多數的奴隷去作、故他們的敎育可不必要職業的準備、所以希臘人在風光明媚、海面呈紫色、生活很舒服的環境裏、就是享受美的生活美、不僅是希臘人生活的中心點、The　Ounter　P　infs　of　Greek　Life而且是希臘文化的基礎、然其文化的大發展却後於波斯戰爭、以後因發生有自信力、從前歸諸神話的、竟敢試以自然的解釋了、所以亞理士多德Srisotle說、『自波斯戰爭以後、人們自負其成功、向前衝進、一切智識為活動的領域、且要追求那更廣深的學問、』然波斯戰爭雖是促成希臘文化底原動力、而文化的完成仍是受着地理的恩惠、我們再把地圖來看、希臘底海岸頗多曲折、雖無高山大河、然有許多小山詠縱橫着、故地勢很凹凸、忽成山脈、忽為　陵、這縱橫的山脈作障碍、把希臘割成了許多相隔絕的區域、在每一區域內、發展它自足的經濟生活、獨立的統治政府、以至變成不同的制度、敎育、法律與習慣、每一區域萬有兩相對峙的城市、環城的便是附屬的耕種土地、擴張到四面山坡之上、這種區域、就叫作「城市國家」·Citg　Ates</p>
<p>這裏面有幼比亞Euboen、羅克里Loerio伊托力Aetola福息斯Phocts、比奧細亞Boeotia、阿岐亞Achaeu、阿哥力Argolio、哀力斯Eli、阿凱狄亞Aroiada、麥西比亞Meceoia、可尼亞Lnconiu、其城名叫作斯巴達Sbunta、又有阿替卡AJicn、其城名叫作雅典Asbens、這許多的城市國家、雖各自發展其政治與經濟等、但互相競爭、也是當仁不讓的在競爭中、幸含有同一種族的自覺意識、組織共同信仰的宗敎同盟Amphictiony並為保護神殿敬奉神明起見、遂發起奧林匹克Olympi競技大會、以資聯絡、總上所述、為希臘底文化的便慨、茲將各聯絡邦中　霸的斯巴達與雅典、分敘如下</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>智辯</h3>
<p>— 錦明</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>坐在山半間松樹底下，口裏吸着老遠九十里以外市街帶來的DouieeFagle，打算談些瑣雜的事。映霖說：</p>
<p>「……有一天，我們也許會再坐在這裏，餓死在這裏。祖宗沒有一樣合式的東西遺給我們，對於智識界，尤其悽慘。農人們種得有穀子，牧畜者管得有些牛羊，兵士們背得有武器，此外都不免走上同一個劣命，我們知識者的遺產，就述安慰我們自己也不能毅。還是看些風景得啦。』</p>
<p>我覺得自己沒有話可囘答。旣不欲死，又不欲生，這是人的一個大缺點，這樣恩想，也祇算得不値半文錢的「失敗主義」，無論這種日子的確有來到的可能。</p>
<p>祖宗給我們的文化遺產，不說別的，祗是言辭，論辯一種，也足以啓發一些沒有武器沒有資財的人們的生存不是沒有意義的。古時歐洲演說家如秋姆遜士，如西塞羅，活著時祇有一張嘴，死後的遺產祗有一些光榮，但以後的精神事業却從未斷絕過，因為所謂『造物者，』有意這麼安排人類，人類本身也願意把最後的光榮呈獻這種人，這種人所能希望的也祇有這種權利。</p>
<p>我想，當戰爭毀了一切，毀滅所有的出版文化的時候，知識者總還有在盻望「生」的生的方式，離開筆，還有一張嘴。</p>
<p>在當今，社會經濟思想和物質勻配佈置下，嘴大約也沒有很大用處了，古帝王時代的市民的矜恤，騎士同情，已不復存在了，靠一張嘴來掀動大波固是不可能的事，但折衝衡情，絞量得失，舉仁摘義，運機諒策，這些略略可以糾正悖謬和野蠻工夫，現代與將來總還要延續的。齊魯春秋載伍員見吳王僚，僚和他，坐談二日，辭無覆者」，可見伍員離開了武器還有一張嘴，連嘴說不動時候，他還有智謀帮助闔　成全了志願。</p>
<p>詩外傳記載孔夫子講到談說之術很有些意味，且不管話是不是真的來自王麻子老店，但祖宗們吿訴子孫學「文」的：怎樣才活得有生意，這情形總値得欣賞。他以為：「談說之術，齋莊以立之，端誠以處之，强堅以待之，辟稱以喻之，分以明之，數忻芬芳以送之……是則說恆無不行。」看來，這樣一張技巧的嘴，不一定靠什麽天才，原來是自修得到的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>談到言變之巧，早一些的，許多稱讚晏嬰。晏嬰沒有儒家那般迂闊，也不至和蘇張一樣全是為的權術。</p>
<p>『齊景公遣晏子南使楚。楚王聞之，……左右曰：『晏子天下之辯士也，與之議國家之事則不如也。王獨可以與晏子坐，使有司東人過王，王問之，使言齊人善盜故束之，是宜可以困之。』王曰：『善。』……居有間，束徒以過之，王曰，『何為者？』有司對曰；『是齊人善盜，束而詣吏。』王欣然大笑曰：『齊乃冠帶之國　士之化，固善盜乎？』晏子曰：『……王不見乎江南之樹乎？名橘樹，樹之江北則化為枳，何則？土地使然耳。夫子處齊之時，冠帶而立，儼有伯夷之廉；今居楚而善益，意土地之化使然兩！』</p>
<p>這個對的故事很熱知，可是値得作再三的囘味。還舉二則：</p>
<p>齊景公遊於牛山之上，而北望齊曰：『美哉國乎！鬱鬱泰山！使古而無死者，則寡人將去此而何之？』俯而泣沾襟，國子高子日：『然。臣賴君之賜，蔬食惡肉可得而食也，駑馬柴車可得而乘也，且猶不欲死，況君乎！』晏子曰：『樂哉，今日嬰之遊也。見怯君一而諛臣二，使古而無死者，則太公至今猶存，吾君方今將被簑笠而立乎畎畝之中，惟事之恤，何暇念死』！</p>
<p>齊景公出弋昭華之池。顏鄧聚主鳥而亡之。景公怒，欲殺之。晏子曰：『夫鄧聚有死罪四，請數而誅之。景公曰：『諾』。晏子曰：『鄧聚為吾君主鳥，而亡之，是罪一也；使吾君以鳥之故而殺人，是罪二也，使四國緒侯聞之，以吾君重鳥而輕士，是罪三也；天子聞之，必將貶絀吾君，危其社稷，絕其宗廟，是罪四也。此四罪者故當殺無赦，臣請加誅焉』。景公曰：止。此亦吾過矣。願夫子為寡人敬謝焉』。</p>
<p>這樣的『智辯』，可謂眞的幽默，較之隨手拈出一個信口開河的袁中郎眞幽默得多。固然，物質主義時代的文學智辯之土，看不起過去的奴才身份了，因便就看不起這種辯術，這是笑話。至少，士人總遊離不了社會生活。</p>
<p>唐韓愈以一埸巧辯平了待發的內亂，宋寇準的不挫之辭，使漢北胡見束手南犯都是辯衛有効果的，雖則效果不一定都有，可是辯術本身總値得欣賞的。</p>
<h3>五分鐘（三）</h3>
<p>— 羅烽</p>
<p>賀錚的兩條腿有點發軟，他胆怯地向後移動着笨重的脚，脚鐐忽然響了，這響聲提醒了他——胆怯，　避，不都是愚蠢的自欺嗎？同時，他想，在這樣情况下，逃出死時的範圍是絕對不可能的，現在他反而覺得要能快一些死，倒是自己的勝利。</p>
<p>他的一隻手已經觸到那隻猛獸的毛，毛是短而硬的。賀錚心里想：虎呢？熊呢？他為甚麼還不動手？是睡着了嗎？而後他亂揮着拳頭，企圖驚醒她，無意中打在在他的頭上，他這才發覺，她旣不是虎，又不是能，而是一匹馬。</p>
<p>由於這匹馬，又引起賀錚逃生的幻想；伏在馬背上或是側坐在馬背上，他就可以駕御着它衝出敵人的封鎖，就可以逃出這座荒山更僥倖而平安地囘到自己的部隊那邊去……</p>
<p>馬，一聯串地打着響鼻。</p>
<p>兩個看守兵兵然在馬廐外面巡邏着。</p>
<p>賀錚直呆呆地站在原地進行他的幻想，然而那幻想只有那末一點點在他的踏子里翻來覆去地滾着，滾着……始終不能和他的理想接近。</p>
<p>突然有種强烈的，搖擺不穩的電光，從外面直射進來，它被這馬廐的疏稀的立往分割成無數白色的粗線，一忽兒落在賀錚的身上，一忽兒落在馬的身上，或地下。</p>
<p>這時候兩名看守兵已停止巡邏，有一種較輕的步，代替了他們的脚步，似乎隨着電光的加强，而逐漸加重着。</p>
<p>現在賀錚巳經停止了不成為理想的幻想。他完全明白老近來的是什麽，他很想迎接下去，但是整個身子偏偏沉重得不能移動一步，於是，他祗好獻出年靑的生命，等候它來攫取他。</p>
<p>手電筒的大光圈擊個罩住了他，賀錚變成一個盲人，任什慶全不看見。他只能聽到敵軍司令官的急促無情的腔調，接着通譯員的口昔：</p>
<p>『考慮好了嗎？』</p>
<p>假如不是這個提示，賀錚幾乎把它忘懷了。</p>
<p>五分鐘以內，他一點考慮全沒有，除了那一點企圖逃生的幻想而外，儘在祈求着死，好像祇有死，才能使他得到至上的安慰。</p>
<p>賀錚對於那含有侮辱性的訊問，置之不答。他昂着頭傲然地迎着强烈的電光走過去。金色的符號，炫耀在鮮明的領章上。通譯員譒譯着司令官的話：</p>
<p>『時備到了！』</p>
<p>『是的，我恭候已久啦！』</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>從捧的老法子說到批評</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>我們一向的捧埸家總有一個老法子，一便是只抓住所捧的人底一點似是而非的長處，給他大大地發揮一陣，叫人認為這就是他一生行為的全部，從前給人做『墓誌銘」和一毒序」的人就玩的是這一手。他偶然給窮人送了一件破衣裳，捧場家便尊之為大慈善家，然而實際上他　是打死過丫頭的家長；他客廳裏掛過一幅什麽人寫的對聯，捧場家便稱之為『博雅』，然而他一生實實在在沒有看過一本書；甚至他不過給太太請過一次醫生，捧埸家便誇他與「夫人和好極篤」，然而他却討著七八個小老婆。</p>
<p>這法子在捧場方面是極不錯的，因為不這樣，「棒」的目的就難以達到。不過這只能用在「捧』，要是正式給一個人去做評傳這法子就會弄出很大的毛病來了。</p>
<p>譬如罷，馮道曾經在後唐底皇帝面前朗誦過別人底詩句以說明老百姓生活的艱難，這一段故事自然「博雅」得很，也『慈善』得　；但倘是只抓住這一點便認為是馮道　個的人格，而把他只顧做官，不顧亡國的事完全丟開不談，這種評傳到底是甚麼，你且想想看！再醫如罷，阮大鋮是有文學天才的人，他不但是戲劇的大作家之一，而且還是出色的導演家，他底「博雅』纔是沒有一點假冐的，但倘是只抓住這一面的阮大鋮，專誇他文學上的成績，却一概不提他投降滿淸的行為，這種評傳又是甚麼，你且想想看！在相反的方面也不會兩樣，假使因為孔子見過南子，便斷定孔子是吊膀子的專家，却也無論如何是寃枉的。這都說明要論一個人，須得看他大的傾向是怎樣而從他大的傾向做出的結論，纔可說得上是對於他的定論。同樣的，要做文藝批評，也不能跳出這個圈子。</p>
<p>淸代畫家王素，曾經畫過一套很好的耕織圖。那一套連環圖畫是很出名的而且確也可以稱為王素底傑作之一。但我們是不是根據個，就說王素是一位農民畫家呢？自然不行。因為王素一生大部分的工作都是在畫上層社會的仕女，耕織剛並不能代表他底全部。批評一位文藝家，也是要看他大的傾向的。要不然，他底面孔便會給弄歪。見了明人底幾遍小品文，並不査考一下作者主要的業績，只盲目地推之為『性靈大家，甚至還預在頭上』，作為自已受難時的護身符，相信自然會有些人相信的，但是實際上只是瞎說一通而已。</p>
<p>只批評一部作品或一篇作品，依然不能跳出這個圈子。</p>
<p>不過我們底老法子却早已發揮到批評方面了。所謂『斷章取義』，就是指的這一類的批評，只隨便在作品上扯下一塊，便可以大發一陣議論，用不着費神去研究作品底全體，這在批評家自然是很痛快的不過的，不過為作品本身着想，可實在不大好。只把『水滸傳』上西門慶和潘金蓮的一段址下來，便指『水滸傳』為『淫書』，沒有看過全部『水滸傳』的人或者會相信的罷，但是事實上却把『水滸傳』給『凌遲處死』了。</p>
<p>然而這種批評再向前進，就成了『摘句取義」，這自然更加痛快，只要隨意在幾萬字或幾千字中間摘出一句或兩句，便可以大顯一下批評家底權威，法子的高妙是不待說了，不過這結果却會成為文字游戲，批評家會在自已底鼻子上塗下一條粉的，金聖歎會經用這法子評過『水滸傳』以及其他的所謂『才子書』，但我們不是也就覺得金聖歎常常好像是一個丑角嗎。</p>
<p>照我們學者所提倡過的文學的進化觀看來，這「摘句取義」還會前進為『摘字取義』在幾萬字或幾千字中間摘出一個「不」字，便可指為是宣傳虛無哲學，在幾萬字或幾千字中間再摘出個一嗚呼」便可指為是表現悲觀主義，批評家到這時候，那纔是到了澈底痛快的境界，但是「有一利，必有一弊一，只可惜批評却為遷就批評家的痛快而被犧牲得不見了。</p>
<h3>耗子</h3>
<p>— 一得</p>
<p>你想晚上很安閒，很恬靜的讀一些書，有了耗子，那是不可能的。不是東邊嘰哩哇啦，便是西邊器物作響；有時還會在天花板上行軍呢！大有「不聞號令，但聞人馬行聲」之概。</p>
<p>假使有別人睡在我這裏，定會疑心有「鬼」，不保他不把頭縮在被窩裏；我却弄慣了，我做我的事，因為我知道這些都是耗子的「宵小伎倆」。</p>
<p>耗子眞是一位「洞悉世情」的哲學家。有一晚上，不知那位小孩子，剩下了一個饅頭，我就把牠放在床邊凳子上，選了根尺來長，木棍，握在手裏，心想等耗子來時，定會給牠一個『下馬威』。但不行，牠好像具有一人的靈性」，竟沒有來。我有備，牠就不敢逞了。</p>
<p>可是人是文明的，耗子在書桌上踱方步，人睡在床上，雖學着貓兒的怒吼，裝着貓兒的姿勢，跳着躍着（其實不是脚跳）。把床弄得格枝格枝的響，耗子畢竟不和文明人自己一樣：『以已之心，度人之量』；『喂！拿來嚇　個，』牠帶着微笑，慢慢地走了。</p>
<p>人沒奈何，只好在那裏裝腔勢，摩拳擦掌。冰冷的天，誰高興出來管閒事，睡在被窩裏　不好，根豎損失些微的食物，吵得人不安　了。並且最要注意的，還有『投鼠忌器』，只好就此寬容了他。</p>
<p>然而這是說的以前的話，因為我有的一隻老貓，正在生小貓，所以沒有力量捕鼠，而耗子們就不怕牠，還敢在貓的窠內，走進走出，現在我們的老貓和新生的小貓，都怒吼起來了；耗子已被咬死不少，不久就要絕跡了。</p>

<h3>How Youth Can Accomplish Wartime Tasks (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Xi'an by Airmail</p>
<p>The fifth lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must go through certain stages. Generally speaking, when an organization begins to develop, it must first unite the activists and then rely on the activists to unite the broad masses. The organizations of the broad masses are often weaker in their initial political nature and gradually strengthen to become more advanced organizations. Local organizations can gradually become national organizations through development. Disunified organizations can gradually become unified organizations through development. Any organization must inevitably undergo complex evolution; conversely, it is impossible to establish an ideal organization all at once without complex evolution.</p>
<p>The sixth lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must be closely aligned with the development of the war situation. The development of organizations in war zones is smoother than in non-war zones because the military and the government's need for youth increases during wartime, and the youth's need for organization also increases. In some places, no youth groups were allowed to organize originally, but once the enemy came and the situation became critical, youth work teams, service teams, self-defense forces, guerrillas, and all kinds of organizations were set up.</p>
<p>The seventh lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must be closely aligned with the development of general mass movements. We youth are the vanguard of the mass movement, so we must not only do youth work but also organize the general masses. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we youth also need the help of general mass movements to avoid being isolated; and in many cases, especially in rural areas, if our elders do not help us, our work will be difficult to carry out. Therefore, the youth movement and the general mass movement must have appropriate links.</p>
<p>The eighth lesson we have learned is that in the development of an organization, the top-down method and the bottom-up method must be closely combined. Under favorable and possible conditions, the top-down method has a great effect. If, at this time, the organization is only developed from the bottom up and does not receive help from the upper levels, it will inevitably encounter difficulties; but only relying on the top-down method, completely adopting the method of ordering the establishment and ordering the joining, there is no hope of development. Even if it develops, it will inevitably be unconsolidated and lack strength.</p>
<p>There are many youth groups that have offices and operating funds, but they have no actual work for months or years. Some youth groups only have committee members and no members, because all the members have become committee members. Not only that, but some committee members and officers are not even members, or they are not even clear whether they are members, because they only remember taking salaries. They have neither joined the organization nor attended meetings, and of course, they have not withdrawn from the organization. Perhaps they have joined the organization, perhaps they have attended meetings, but this is involuntary; in this situation, they cannot declare their withdrawal; they can only use passive resistance to show that they are only honorary members who have been hired.</p>
<p>This is not a joke, but a fact that everyone can see. This is because these groups have not paid attention to the bottom-up approach and have not paid attention to the principle of democratic voluntarism. Such groups are only a sign and a badge, and signs and badges cannot resist the enemy or build the country.</p>
<p>In order to organize the broadest masses of youth to jointly resist the enemy and build the country, we must not only study our experiences and lessons in organizational work but also study our experiences and lessons in leadership work. Whether an organization can develop depends on our methods of organizing youth, but if there is a good organization, good policies and resolutions, and no good leadership to ensure their implementation, the organization will still disintegrate.</p>
<p>What is considered good leadership?</p>
<p>First, implement collective leadership and individual responsibility. All work must be discussed in meetings and implemented according to the opinions passed by the majority. "Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang." After everyone's discussion, our work arrangements must be much more thorough. Once the work is decided, it must be assigned to various people to take responsibility separately, I take responsibility for mine, you take responsibility for yours, and at the same time, everyone must take care of each other and take care of the whole, this is called division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Second, have a plan. Work must have certain steps and a certain center, and must not fall into a chaotic state of so-called clericalism. Just as riding a horse must hold the reins, our work must also follow a plan and grasp the center in order to have a clear understanding.</p>
<p>Third, there must be inspection. Simply having a plan cannot guarantee the completion of the plan, there must be regular meetings and frequent inspections to urge the execution of the plan, and to study whether there are any difficulties or errors in the execution. If the scope of an organization covers a very large area, the leading organ must have inspectors. The task of the inspector is not to mechanically issue orders or deliberately nitpick, but to help the lower levels solve difficulties. Helping the lower levels is not to replace the lower levels, and attention must still be paid to cultivating the ability of the lower levels to work independently and to bring into play the creativity, initiative and enthusiasm of the lower levels.</p>
<p>Fourth, there must be self-criticism. When we inspect our work, we will definitely find the advantages and disadvantages of the work. At this time, we need serious and bold criticism. We should not conceal our shortcomings at all, and there should be not only top-down criticism but also bottom-up criticism. But our criticism is not to attack, but to help and educate, so our criticism should not be excessive; we should not only see the shortcomings, but also see the advantages and promote these advantages; and we should not only be passive criticism but also point out positive solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, we must implement genuine democratic centralism. On the one hand, we must be democratic, and important opinions must be discussed and decided by everyone, and everyone must participate in the discussion and jointly take responsibility; on the other hand, we must also be centralized, that is, the minority must obey the majority, and everyone must obey the leading organs elected by everyone and the resolutions passed by everyone. The so-called extreme democratization means that no matter when and no matter what happens, everyone must discuss it first, and if the minority has any opinions about the decisions of the majority or the decisions of the lower levels about the upper levels, they will not implement them, which will inevitably lead to the stagnation of work. The organization will disintegrate, and democracy will not be talked about. Having democracy does not mean that discipline is not necessary, discipline is necessary and is also a kind of education method. However, discipline should not be too harsh, and it should not be abused.</p>
<p>All organizational work and leadership work must be done by someone, and that person is the cadre. Without cadres, what we have said is just empty talk, so it is said that "cadres decide everything".</p>
<p>Our youth movement needs all kinds of cadres. We need military cadres, political cadres, cadres who can bury their heads in hard work, cadres who can promote, speak and write articles, cadres who are good at socializing, good at united front work, and good at sports and entertainment work. Anyone who has a skill can become our cadre.</p>
<p>The cadres of our youth movement should be such a kind of people: they are loyal to the cause of people's liberation, they are able to get close to the youth and gain the faith of the youth - they are not afraid to take responsibility, do not talk empty words but can actually work; they are content with their duties, and are not always half-hearted, regardless of the importance of the work; they should be very lively, because liveliness is one of the important conditions for youth work; they must also be able to constantly learn from work, correct mistakes in work, and improve their understanding.</p>
<p>Because of the rapid development of the war situation and the youth movement situation, these old cadres gradually feel that they cannot adapt well to the new working conditions, so our cadres urgently need a new round of training. Our cadres need to fully understand the working methods of the youth united front, especially the working methods in rural youth. Our cadres should carefully summarize all the experiences of the peasant work in the XXXX area, the XXXX area, North China and other war zones, and summarize all the experiences of students in the peasant work. Our cadres should learn well from the rural youth, be familiar with all their lives, and strive to cultivate a large number of new rural youth cadres. In addition, we need to pay attention to the specialization of youth cadres, pay attention to the mutual transfer of cadres in various regions and at all levels, and promote the atmosphere of mutual learning among cadres, which is also an urgent requirement of our work at present.</p>
<p>We need excellent cadres, and we need correct cadre policies.</p>
<p>We must be good at recognizing cadres. Cadres are not perfect, and they will never be said from a model. As long as we can see all aspects of the cadre, use his strengths and overcome his weaknesses, we will find that everyone is usable. Otherwise, we will find that no one is usable.</p>
<p>We are good at using cadres. We must promote cadres from actual work and from a political perspective. Do not lightly promote and transfer cadres, so that cadres cannot be competent and cannot be at ease. We must trust cadres and make cadres trust themselves: certain instructions and inspections are necessary. But never interfere in everything, so that he loses his automatic confidence.</p>
<p>We want to love cadres. We must often help cadres. If cadres make mistakes, don't exaggerate them, and don't use serious terms to make them feel panic and psychological pressure. We must also pay attention to the work emotions of cadres and the legitimate needs in life.</p>
<p>We want to unite cadres. Ideological consistency is the basic condition for unity. Questions should be discussed more often with each other. Before discussing, we should think carefully. The more fully prepared we are, the more we encounter ideas, and the easier it is to approach opinions. The attitude of discussion should be humble, objective, generous, and able to put ourselves in each other's shoes, and be able to give up small differences and seek common ground. In this way, even if different opinions arise, they will not tend to extremes, will not hinder the basic principle of consistency, and will not affect the unity of cadres.</p>
<p>With correct organizational methods and leadership methods, with excellent cadres and correct cadre policies, our Chinese youth will definitely be able to complete our organizational tasks, and therefore will definitely be able to complete our political tasks.</p>
<p>Because we Chinese youth are striving towards the same goal in the same environment, we not only shoulder the same organizational tasks, but also in all our organizational work, we should and can consistently adhere to the same working spirit and the same style of work.</p>
<p>Our style should first of all be a firm political stance. Our position is the common program of Chinese youth, which is to adhere to supporting the long-term resistance war ×××××, supporting the National Government and Chairman Chiang, supporting the Three Principles of the People and the program of resisting the enemy and building the country, and supporting the democratic and voluntary close unity of youth across the country under these principles, regardless of party affiliation, class, gender, or race, to form a great united front (applause). Our position is not to be shaken in any way; if anyone tries to shake our position with threats or inducements, we will make him recognize the great power of our Chinese youth. (applause)</p>
<p>Our style should secondly be flexible, enterprising, and practical. Because our position must be embodied in daily work, we do not welcome dreamers and empty talkers, what we want are those who are down-to-earth and work hard, we do not welcome empty terms and empty formulas, what we want are calm and thorough thinking, concrete and practical analysis of the situation, and solving problems.</p>
<p>Our style should be one of hard struggle. Because our work is inevitably not simple and easy, if it were, our ideal would have been realized long ago, and there would be no need for us to work. We must fight to the end with perseverance, we must be prepared at any time and anywhere to encounter difficulties and overcome difficulties, and to encounter obstacles and remove obstacles, we must be prepared at any time and anywhere to sacrifice everything for the liberation of the nation and the liberation of youth.</p>
<p>Our style should be democratic. Because only democracy can unite the broad masses of youth to fight together, only democracy can eliminate prejudice, understand the overall truth, overcome closed-doorism, promote the enthusiasm of youth, and expose those who isolate the masses. Our youth groups now lack democracy the most, and our country now needs democracy the most, so we youth must promote democracy even more and help promote our entire country to the path of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Our style should be youthful. Because we ourselves are youth, our task is to unite youth, and to fight for the interests of youth, our actions must be lively and courageous, full of vitality, we must be familiar with sports and entertainment work, be able to speak the words that youth can understand, be able to do the things that youth like, and develop all the virtues of youth.</p>
<p>We youth should especially study. We have already said that youth is the era of learning, and the natural task of youth is to study. Only continuous learning can make us constantly progress, and our continuous progress is precisely what all our work requires. The tasks of our Chinese youth are very heavy and arduous, therefore, our hard study is of decisive significance.</p>
<p>We will use this style and this spirit of hard study to carry out our organizational tasks. We believe that the spirit of all Chinese youth is consistent with ours; and we also believe that only in this way can we be worthy of the youth of China today.</p>
<p>Because we Chinese youth have this spirit, we are not at all distraught and at a loss in the face of the unprecedented crisis of our nation. We fully believe in the future, because we fully believe in ourselves. We believe even more in our great motherland.</p>
<p>We have already received the profound grace of our motherland, and we believe that our motherland will definitely continue to love us and support us in the future; we hope that the national leaders, the leaders of all political parties, the military and political officials, and the advanced people from all walks of life will continue to lead us forward. They will definitely lead us, and we youth will definitely not let them down. We will dedicate our pure and enthusiastic blood to fighting to the end for the victory of the war of resistance, and to fighting to the end for an independent, free and happy Republic of the Three Principles of the People!</p>
<h3>How Can Youth Go to the Countryside?</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Xi'an by Feng Wenbin</p>
<p>First Question: What is the special significance of rural work?</p>
<p>We have said that the development of the War of Resistance has led to most of our important cities being occupied by the enemy. Therefore, our future work must be centered on the countryside. Of course, focusing on the countryside does not mean that we should relax our work in the cities. We still have many cities in our rear areas, and in these cities, there are millions of young students, workers, shop assistants, and clerks who need us to organize, unite, educate, and mobilize. But the fact is that a larger proportion of young people are now in the countryside.</p>
<p>Can we rely on our villages to fight to reclaim the enemy's cities? Yes, we can. First, China is originally a backward country, and cities cannot represent everything in China. The enemy's occupation of many of our cities cannot control our fate. Second, China is a country with a very broad territory, and it is impossible for the enemy's forces to occupy and blockade all our villages. Even the cities in our rear areas cannot all be taken by the enemy. Third, and most importantly, China has revolutionary classes, revolutionary parties, revolutionary armies, and people. These forces make our countryside not only different from the countryside in Europe and America, not only different from the countryside in small countries, but also completely different from the Chinese countryside in the era of the Eight-Nation Alliance.</p>
<p>There are many difficulties in rural work, which is undeniable. The countryside is generally scattered and unconcentrated. Feudal forces and feudal ideas are relatively strong. The minds of rural residents are more conservative, and their vision is often limited to the daily trivial matters of their own families. Their cultural level is very low, and they are generally ignorant of the national crisis. Moreover, their lives are the most miserable, and their burdens are often very unreasonable. Coupled with the madness of Japanese imperialism, their suffering is particularly severe. Precisely because of these many difficulties, rural work is particularly backward and requires our intensified efforts.</p>
<p>Second Question: How should we carry out work in the countryside?</p>
<p>1. To carry out youth work in the countryside, we must first understand that it is inseparable from general peasant work. Because feudal ideas are relatively strong in the countryside, and the status of young peasants is very low, not to mention young women. Therefore, to carry out work among them, we must first start with the propaganda and organization of middle-aged and elderly people. In addition, rural youths over the age of fifteen or sixteen are often already married and bear very important responsibilities in production. Therefore, their lives are actually not far from those of ordinary adults. Therefore, rural youth work is particularly closely related to general peasant work. Because of this, we will not necessarily specifically mention rural youth when we talk about rural work later.</p>
<p>Secondly, pay attention to becoming peasant-like. Intellectuals are too far removed from peasant life, so the biggest obstacle to going to the countryside is the inability to become peasant-like. In the past, there was a famous leader of the peasant movement in China. He was originally a young master from a large landlord family and a returned student. He went to the countryside wearing a suit and stood on the table to give speeches to the peasants. At first, some people listened, but later, fewer and fewer people listened. After learning this lesson, he wore peasant clothes, lived among the peasants, and helped the peasants solve many daily problems. Only in this way did he gradually gain the trust of the peasants. From this anecdote, we can see the importance of becoming peasant-like. Becoming peasant-like means wearing peasant clothes, speaking the language of peasants, and integrating with peasants in terms of daily life. In particular, we must understand peasant customs and habits, and pay special attention to the relationship between men and women and superstition issues. Don't let the peasants find it unpleasant. We must also study the peasants' labor life and their inherent political concepts clearly so as not to cause mutual estrangement and suspicion.</p>
<p>Some young people went to the peasants' homes, and the peasants warmly poured tea for them to drink. Seeing that the teacups were too dirty, they refused to drink. When asked to sit down, they took out a handkerchief and dusted the stool again and again. Naturally, the peasants were unhappy. It is nothing for urban youth to wash their feet in a washbasin. When they live in peasants' homes, they wash their feet in the peasants' washbasin. The peasants hate these young people very much. They have wasted a few years of schooling and don't even know the difference between the top and bottom of the body. Urban youth also do not pay much attention to waste paper and casually use it to wipe their buttocks. When the peasants see this, they feel that these young people are really not human. Peasant customs and habits vary from place to place, and languages vary even more, so there are more troubles. Some words are very common here, or even considered polite, but saying them there is scolding. If you are not careful, the peasants may fight with you. In the South, calling someone "boss" is polite. In some parts of North China, it refers to someone who runs a brothel. From this, it can be seen that it is indeed not easy to become peasant-like.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we must go through appropriate intermediaries and bridges. When we first arrive in the countryside, we don't know the masses in the countryside, so in order to get close to them, we must first go through some people who have prestige in the countryside and are respected by everyone, such as the Henan Women's Drama Troupe, which went through a respected woman in the local area. Or through rural intellectuals, especially primary school teachers. Primary school teachers in China generally lead very miserable lives, are relatively young, and have a relatively clear political understanding, so their anti-Japanese sentiments are very high. In the countryside, because they educate the children of the local masses and can often write letters and solve problems for the masses, they are easily trusted by the masses. Therefore, going through them to approach the masses is of great help to the work. Or through active elements among the peasants, through the peasants' own leaders. These people are probably physically strong, smart, and active, can speak, and have some ideas. Some people are afraid of confusing these people with local ruffians. In fact, the difference between the two is obvious, because ruffians are idle and do not engage in proper occupations, so they cannot gain the trust and love of the masses. Or through the relationship of relatives, friends, fellow villagers, and classmates. If there are no such relationships, then become sworn brothers, sworn sisters, or even sworn fathers and sworn mothers.</p>
<p>In order to get close to the peasants, we also need to choose appropriate opportunities and use appropriate methods. Rural temple fairs and markets are the most capable of gathering the masses. It is, of course, very convenient to carry out work at this time. When the peasants are busy, it is best to help them with their labor. Some young people in Shandong organized a rural anti-Japanese team, which helped the peasants harvest wheat during the day and talked with the peasants in the early morning. Popular art, whether it is pictures, songs, or dramas, can best attract the peasants, especially young people and children. Sometimes you can also go through them to approach their parents. Opening small-scale schools and providing simple medical care are also very effective in approaching the peasants.</p>
<p>Third Question: How to organize rural youth and the general public?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the form of organizational work in the countryside should be as simple as possible and should be able to adapt to the rural environment. This should be combined with the peasants' own needs. For example, if it can be beneficial to their cultivation and harvest, it will be easily welcomed by them.</p>
<p>When there are few obstacles, establish new-style, relatively strict organizations, such as the Peasants' National Salvation Association and the Youth National Salvation Association. However, the methods of grouping and holding meetings should also be flexible so that the peasants do not feel constrained or forced. Otherwise, you can also adopt old-fashioned organizations or superstitious organizations, which still have a considerable foundation among the peasants. We should join them and work within them. We should not criticize gods and scold ghosts, because that will not break superstition, but only increase the peasants' hatred for us. In these superstitious organizations, we must first focus on winning over their leaders to the path of resistance against Japan. In order to gain their trust, we must be able to integrate with them, burn incense and worship Buddha, and do everything patiently. A youth organization in Henan used this method to establish a very close relationship with them. Later, they completely guided their organization into a force for national salvation.</p>
<p>Women's work in the countryside should be done by female comrades. It is even better to start with older women. Women's organizations need some transitional forms to prepare. For example, first mobilize them to learn to read, recite anti-Japanese scriptures, sew clothes for soldiers, wash clothes, etc., and then organizing them will be easier. When doing women's work in the countryside, we must pay special attention to the rural customs. For example, do not put forward slogans against family constraints, but promote family harmony. It is the same content, but the former will arouse opposition from parents, while the latter will not. In some places, there are many nuns in the countryside. If we start organizing women from them, we will definitely not succeed. It is the same reason.</p>
<p>When carrying out children's work in the countryside, we must also pay attention to the attitude of parents. In some places, parents are afraid that their children will also have to become soldiers, so they oppose the organization of anti-Japanese children's groups. But if the words "anti-Japanese" are removed, they will not object. Of course, this is not a common situation, but it can be used as a reference for us. Children's organizations should also suit children's interests and should be particularly lively. For example, when teaching them in class, they should attend classes, sing songs, and when teaching them military affairs, they should practice climbing mountains and charging, and standing guard. The same is true for other work.</p>
<p>Fourth Question: How to carry out rural work after having an organization? To carry out work in the countryside, we must pay attention to the united front between the upper and lower levels in the countryside. We must go through the upper levels, through the Bao-Jia heads, Lian-Bao directors, or powerful gentry. In this way, we can get convenience in all aspects. During the work, on the one hand, we must strive to assist the government's mobilization work, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to appropriately using the united front to improve the lives of rural youth and the general public. In particular, we must pay attention to earnestly reforming the method of conscripting soldiers and earnestly implementing the decrees on preferential treatment for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. In this way, the work at the lower levels can be carried out well. In many places, because the conscription of soldiers is unfair, there is corruption and fraud, or there is all kinds of abuse of soldiers. This not only hinders the mobilization work but may even arouse popular unrest. In contrast, the extensive military work of Jin-Cha-Ji not only went through much prior publicity and explanation but also implemented various preferential treatment measures for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. In Jin-Cha-Ji, the children of the families of anti-Japanese soldiers bowed to them when they saw them. Youth organizations often help them chop firewood, carry water, cultivate fields, and harvest wheat. Not only are the families of anti-Japanese soldiers very happy, but the soldiers are also very happy. Therefore, the mobilization work is also carried out very smoothly. Secondly, we must also pay attention to developing the mutual aid and production activities of rural youth and the general public. We must set up more cooperatives. We must set up more rural night schools, literacy classes, and training classes to improve their education. Finally, we must pay special attention to the establishment and rectification of various rural paramilitary organizations. If we are in the midst of war, then the establishment of guerrilla units and the development of guerrilla warfare will be the only focus of rural work.</p>
<p>Fifth Question: The question of intellectuals going to the countryside</p>
<p>Intellectuals now need to shift from the cities to the countryside, and the countryside also needs intellectuals. Why? Because intellectuals are the vanguard of rural work. This is true for rural youth work, and it is also true for general rural mass work. Local intellectuals are of course like this, and external intellectuals still have a great role to play. Although intellectuals also have their weaknesses, because they do not understand and are not accustomed to rural life, their advantages cannot be denied. That is, they have many social relations and a strong political understanding, so they can easily approach people from all walks of life in the countryside and easily develop a united front in the countryside.</p>
<p>There are several ways for intellectuals to go to the countryside. They can work through long-term or short-term organizations such as rural service groups and fellow-villager work groups. They can work through organizations such as anti-Japanese support associations and sacrifice alliance associations. They can work through organizations such as mass schools, rural education promotion associations, and rural cooperatives. It is even better to work through military and government agencies such as Bao-Jia, social training teams, and self-defense teams. If they can assume some important positions in them and have a considerable status, the work will naturally be much smoother. However, in any case, they must be able to be practical, hardworking, patient, and persistent, and set an example in their lives everywhere. They must not only integrate with rural youth but also be their model and gain their trust. Only in this way can they truly become cadres for rural work.</p>
<p>The general process of intellectuals working in the countryside is usually to enter organization through propaganda. When organizational work has developed considerably, youth peasant cadres will gradually emerge, and intellectuals will become relatively senior leaders. Here we must oppose two tendencies: one is to look down on rural youth, thinking that rural youth have no knowledge and cannot be cadres for organizational work; the other is to look down on intellectuals, thinking that intellectuals cannot play a vanguard role and cannot be promoters of rural youth. Both of these tendencies are wrong. We must use the vivid facts from all over the world to shatter them to pieces.</p>

<h3>Our Army in Jin and Hubei Score Successive Victories / Enemy Enlarges Yellow River Breach, Transfers Troops to West / Our Air Force Flies Over Northern Henan and Central Hubei to Bomb Enemy</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] According to the Chinese military spokesman here yesterday, the lines have gradually become quiet in recent weeks, seemingly due to the Japanese army's lack of combat personnel and its failure to decide on an operational plan. There have been no changes on the Guangdong-Jiangxi front. As for the banks of the Ao River, only small contacts have occurred. The Japanese army's crossing of the Xiang River and advancing towards Qianjiang is not actually important, as the combatants are only about a thousand men, and they are threatened by Chinese troops on all sides. Recent news from the front states that the Japanese army is trying to operate in western Shanxi and attack Jundu. The spokesman said that only small contacts have occurred in the area. It would be a misjudgment to think that the Japanese army in Shanxi is making a major offensive. He continued that the Japanese army in northern Henan is expanding the breach in the Yellow River so that during the rainy season, the floodwaters of the Yellow River will flow entirely into the sea through the new riverbed, forming a natural barrier to isolate the Chinese and Japanese armies. As a result, the Japanese army can transfer troops westward from east of that area. The breach has already been expanded from 200 meters to 1,000 meters. According to a certain Chinese source, the Japanese army's purpose in expanding the breach in the Yellow River is to transfer troops from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to attack Zhengzhou along the railway and enter Shaanxi.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th] Chinese sources say that the Japanese army is currently fiercely attacking Yichang and has begun to occupy the crossing of the Yangtze River, 135 miles west of Hankou. It is also reported that the Japanese army that crossed the Xiang River is still stubbornly resisting. The report said that Chinese guerrillas raided Qianjiang last night and engaged the Japanese army in hand-to-hand combat. After Chinese aircraft bombed them, the Japanese army began to retreat towards the Xiang River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 6th] The battle situation near Gao'an has become increasingly quiet in recent days. There have been no changes along the Xiangfu Temple and Jin River lines. However, a certain unit of ours still attacked the enemy from time to time. One night, the enemy's artillery positions in Shayuan Hucun were shelled by our artillery, and most of the shells hit their targets, causing heavy damage. The next morning, the enemy retaliated by firing four or five hundred shells at our positions and sending seven aircraft to bomb Xiangfu Temple and Gao'an City, destroying only a few buildings. On the 3rd and 4th and at night, the enemy's artillery fired dozens of shells at us again, all of which fell on the outskirts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinghua, 6th] A squadron of our air force flew to the area along the Longhai Railway on the 20th of last month to search for enemy traces. At Yiji, Xinke, and Zhengyang, they discovered enemy troop transport vehicles and ammunition depots. They dropped many bombs, all of which hit their targets, killing many enemies. When the enemy hastily sent aircraft to intercept them, our air force returned safely.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th] Chinese sources say that eleven Japanese aircraft bombed Yuyang yesterday, dropping eighty-five bombs, burning five hundred houses, and killing twenty-six people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] On the 1st, more than two thousand mixed enemy troops advanced from Lishi to Liujiawan, twenty miles southeast of Liulin, attempting to besiege our army's positions. After our unit bravely resisted, fighting fiercely for three days and nights, the enemy failed. By the morning of the 4th, the enemy had suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] On the 2nd, three or four hundred enemy troops from the area of Jingledong Lirun in northern Shanxi advanced towards Qiaomen (northeast of Jingle). After our unit counterattacked, killing more than fifty enemy troops, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated immediately.</p>
<h3>One Week of Battle Situation / June 1st to 7th / Military Commission Announces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] The spokesman for the Military Commission said that since the enemy's so-called "May Offensive" attempt suffered a serious failure, the battles on the northern and southern fronts have continued to stir restlessly this week, struggling vigorously. Our army, with the remaining courage of repeated victories, has continued to make persistent efforts and has gained many successes, further suppressing the arrogance of the stubborn enemy. Regarding the important battle results, roughly speaking, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>There were no major fierce battles in the Dong River area of Guangdong. However, in the Shilongtan area, the enemy army occasionally tried to harass us with small units, all of which were repelled. In the West River area, more than a thousand enemy troops divided into three routes this week, one from Yangmei Baoshuitang, one from Dawuo Fuhu, and one from Sanshui Highway, and launched fierce attacks on Sanbian Tumeng. By using mobile tactics, we surrounded and severely attacked them one by one. More than half of the enemy died or were wounded. The remaining enemy once broke through the encirclement and occupied the market, which has been thoroughly eliminated. There were no enemy traces along the Xin'an and Xinhe highways. Since the enemy army advanced from Longkou to Niuguling in the North River, the battle situation has remained intense in recent days. Under our superior firepower, the enemy casualties have reached more than four hundred, and the puppet team leader and chief of staff have been captured, along with more than a hundred enemy puppet soldiers. The enemy's momentum is collapsing. Our forces, which are active near Guangzhou, once broke into the city and engaged in street fighting in Xihua Road and Shuangmendiqiao and other places, annihilating most of the enemy garrison troops, capturing prisoners, and burning down many enemy offices, barracks, and warehouses. Later, the enemy launched a joint land and air counterattack from Guanyin Mountain, and our forces withdrew safely. In the wake of their shock, the enemy is now in a state of unease.</p>
<p>Shanxi Province</p>
<p>After the enemy in Shanxi suffered setbacks in the Battle of Mount Wutai last week, they shifted their offensive this week. The enemy troops in western Shanxi, starting from the 1st, launched a westward offensive in multiple directions. One route, with more than two thousand troops, attacked Qikou, and another route, with four or five thousand troops, advanced towards Liulin, attempting to divide and conquer Jundu in a coordinated attack. They were respectively blocked near the highways leading from Qi to Liulin, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in recent months. Currently, both routes of the enemy army have been defeated and are collapsing. By the evening of the 6th, more than a thousand enemy corpses had been abandoned. More than three thousand enemy troops in southern Shanxi launched an offensive on the 6th from Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Heling, engaging our army in fierce battles in Lingjiao Village and Longling and other places. Our officers and soldiers bravely charged and killed many enemy troops. Currently, all routes are still engaged in a stalemate at the original positions, continuing the battle. More than four thousand enemy troops who attacked eastward from Quwo in eastern Shanxi have encountered our army east of Dajiaozhen for several days, fighting fiercely for days. The enemy army once invaded Wuguanzi and Xiaganquan. Later, after sending strong troops to outflank the enemy's rear, we launched a pincer attack, killing more than a thousand enemy troops, including the enemy's regimental commander Nanbu. We shot down an enemy heavy bomber. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray to their original routes.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan Provinces</p>
<p>The enemy in central Hubei, who attacked Suizao, suffered a setback and retreated towards Jingshan, Anlu, Yingshan, Tianmen, and Yuekou, attempting to defend the final stronghold of Zhongxiang. After our continuous fierce attacks, we directly approached the city of Zhongxiang and used artillery to bombard the city walls. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Another part of the enemy army invaded Qianjiang from Yuekou, attempting to contain our army. We saw through this treacherous plan. In addition to intensifying the attack on the besieged enemy in Zhongxiang, we increased the deployment of large armies to encircle Qianjiang and also launched a pincer attack on Yuekou. After three days and nights of bloody fighting, only a few hundred enemy troops remained in the city of Qianjiang, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. The enemy in Yuekou is also facing difficulties from all sides and is unable to defend themselves. They are planning to flee. As for the enemy who attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan, they suffered more than two thousand casualties and their momentum has been weakened. This week, our army continued to advance and recovered Yingdi, such as Guojia Great House and Mabu Great Mountain, gradually approaching the suburbs of Yueyang. In recent days, the enemy has continued to send reinforcements, attempting to put up a desperate fight.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>More than five hundred enemy troops with several cannons from Nanchang launched fierce attacks in two directions, one towards Liugang and one towards Xincun Market, and also released large amounts of poison gas. Our officers and soldiers braved the poison and charged, with the force of a tidal wave, and finally defeated the enemy, killing more than three hundred enemy troops and destroying two enemy cannons. Later, the enemy launched a counterattack with reinforcements, and a fierce battle for control ensued. By the morning of the 2nd, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. Also, our army, which attacked Fengxin, took Phoenix Mountain and Yaqiuling in one fell swoop on the morning of the 3rd. The enemy in the city is now completely within our control. As for our army along the Ruiwu line, one day and night they suddenly used a part of their troops to launch an attack on the county seat from the southeast of Ruichang. The enemy responded hastily and was killed several hundred. On the 2nd, our army near Wuning bombarded the enemy's positions and then launched a fierce attack in multiple directions. The enemy fled in disarray, abandoning more than four hundred corpses. In recent days, we have continued to pursue them and have captured many prisoners. Currently, the vanguard has approached the city of Wuning and is launching a fierce attack on the city.</p>
<p>Other Areas</p>
<p>In addition, in northern Suiyuan, we captured Kalahutong, Fengshengmei, and Xiagobi. In Hebei, we captured Qinghe and Tong County, surrounded Wudi in Lujing near Neiqiu, and attacked Laiwu. In eastern Henan, we captured Lincai and approached Taikang. In southern Anhui, we recovered Shunan and cut off the enemy's communication between Tongling and Datong. In Jiangnan, we captured Xingwei and entered Jurong, recovered Yuanwei, advanced to Yixing, and attacked Wujin. We achieved great success in both strategy and tactics, which is also worth reporting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Financial Market Enters Tense State, Foreign Currencies See New High Prices, Legal Tender and Yen Trend Downward</h3>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] The yen price fell again this morning to 9 jiao 2 fen per yuan in Chinese legal tender. A week ago, each yen was worth 9 jiao 4 fen 2 li 5 hao in Chinese legal tender. Afterwards, the Chinese legal tender depreciated slightly against the shilling by one farthing (i.e., one-fourth of a penny), so the yen rose back to 9 jiao 4 fen. However, observing the general situation, the yen exchange rate is very unstable.</p>
<p>Generally Observed to be Beneficial to Us</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 7th] Regarding the depreciation of the Chinese legal tender, a Reuters reporter specifically sought opinions from bankers managing Far East banking affairs. However, the bankers had no news to report. Some of them believed that the intention behind the depreciation of the Chinese legal tender might be to balance the difference between China's imports and exports. Some believed that those managing China's monetary system might feel that the past price of the legal tender was too high, so they wanted to lower it slightly. Still others believed that the Japanese-controlled Hsing Chung Bank is attempting to control China's foreign exchange. The intention behind the depreciation of the legal tender might be to resist Japan's conspiracy. In addition, many others feel that those managing China's monetary system are deliberately depreciating the legal tender, so that speculators have no way to operate. Although this type of strategy has not been publicly acknowledged by the authorities, in fact, banks managing monetary systems in various countries have often implemented it.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for Suppressing the Legal Tender</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] Shanghai's "Ta Mei Hsiao Pao," owned by Americans, stated that rumors that Britain had suddenly suspended its aid to China's monetary system were a serious error. The "Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund" decided this morning to stop selling foreign exchange at the previous rate, seemingly for three reasons: (1) In the past two months, Shanghai's foreign trade has seen a very large import surplus. As a result of the unlimited supply of foreign exchange, the monthly drain of foreign exchange reached over £2 million. (2) The Japanese are attacking China's foreign exchange fund and a decision has been made to stop them. Recently, the Japanese have obtained a large amount of foreign exchange from the Equalization Fund, unprecedented in quantity. The Japanese use this foreign exchange to support industry and commerce in Central China. Furthermore, the puppet Hsing Chung Bank, using the "Hongkou puppet currency," exchanges it for legal tender in large quantities, competing with the legal tender in Shanghai's open financial market. (3) Because the controlled exchange rate is no longer fully consistent with general exchange conditions, a new, lower exchange rate must be generated in the market. Therefore, the Equalization Fund can continue to operate. "Ta Mei Wan Pao" continued that the Equalization Fund will definitely continue to operate, because the Chinese government is unwilling to see Shanghai's exchange rate deteriorate further. Today, the Chinese government's monetary policy is about to be placed on a new foundation, and the legal tender exchange rate will soon return to a stable level.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Provincial Assembly to be Established on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kunming, 6th] The Yunnan Provisional Assembly is scheduled to be established on July 1st.</p>
<h3>× Occupied Areas Currency Chaos</h3>
<p>[Haitong News Agency Shanghai, 7th] Recently, the financial market in North China has been chaotic, with at least eight types of currency in circulation. In the Japanese-occupied areas, the new United Reserve Bank notes issued by the Japanese army, puppet Manchukuo notes, Japanese yen notes, Korean bank notes, and Japanese military scrip are circulating. In addition, the central government's silver dollar legal tender is still in circulation, especially in the concessions of Tianjin, where it is more popular. In Shanghai, the Japanese yen notes and Japanese military scrip in the Japanese-occupied areas are mostly the Huahsing Bank notes issued. However, the central legal tender is mostly used in the ports along the Yangtze River, with only a few places seeing yen notes and Japanese military scrip. In Xiamen, the legal tender is issued by the central government, and banknotes from the Bank of Taiwan are also commonly used. The central government's legal tender is designated to be issued by four government banks, and provincial banks are no longer authorized to issue legal tender.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Office to Protest Extradition of Criminals in Tianjin</h3>

<h3>British Employee of Shanghai Lun Chang Factory, Dinkler, Died Yesterday, Covered in Wounds, Death Extremely Tragic, British Side to Protest After Autopsy</h3>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] It is learned that the British authorities will soon protest to the Japanese side regarding the murder of Dinkler, a British employee of the Shanghai Lun Chang Printing and Weaving Factory. However, the wording of the protest letter may be determined after the autopsy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th] Shanghai news, Dinkler, a British employee of the British Lun Chang Company who was previously arrested by the Japanese army, died of his injuries at 4:50 this morning, at the age of 45. Dinkler had an argument with the Japanese army in Pudong yesterday morning and was seriously injured. The Japanese side sent him to Hongkou Gongji Hospital at 11:00 last night, where two Japanese naval surgeons and two German surgeons performed emergency surgery. Three armed Japanese soldiers were stationed outside the hospital as guards. When Dinkler was sent to the hospital, it was discovered that he had a head injury, likely caused by a gun butt, as well as three stab wounds to his abdomen and legs. Despite the surgery, he eventually died of his injuries.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 7th] The British government is taking a serious attitude towards the Dinkler incident in Shanghai. It is pointed out here that the area where the factory is located has long been under Japanese control, and there have been frequent disturbances among the workers. After the British side protested, the British army had promised to go to the factory to protect it, but the Japanese side made a written guarantee that it would protect British lives and property, and the British army withdrew. Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Japan raised this question, saying that some Japanese were inciting strikes, and the Japanese side was not taking steps to maintain order.</p>
<p>[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] According to reliable sources, the conflict at the Lun Chang Factory in Pudong yesterday was caused by the Japanese navy going to maintain order, and Dinkler inspected them as if occupying a British factory. As a result, Dinkler was knocked down by a gun butt, and the Japanese army kicked him and stabbed him with a bayonet, causing multiple injuries to Dinkler's lower abdomen. This incident occurred at 9:00 yesterday morning. The Japanese side did not allow foreign doctors to treat Dinkler until 11:00 at night, when he was transported across the Huangpu River. A Japanese spokesman announced today that after Dinkler was disarmed, he attempted to attack a Japanese sailor, so he was surrounded by other sailors. The Japanese spokesman answered reporters' questions, saying that the British Consul-General requested the extradition of Dinkler, but the Japanese side did not grant the request until Mr. Dinkler died. Reporters then asked why extraterritoriality was not respected in this incident. The spokesman said that if a person with extraterritorial rights threatens the Japanese army, the Japanese side can take this action in accordance with international law, whether long-term detention or execution.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Legal Tender Prices</h3>
<p>The sudden drop in the price of legal tender yesterday caused quite a stir in the market. Before the truth is clear, all parties should not speculate wildly, only to alarm themselves. However, we should have the following two basic understandings here:</p>
<p>First, this sudden drop in the legal tender is clearly a response to the conspiracy of Japanese × to undermine our finances. For example, the recent large-scale absorption of legal tender from the occupied areas by the puppet Hsing Chung Bank to exchange for foreign exchange, resulting in a sudden shortage of foreign exchange, is one example. However, our government has long had a correct policy to stabilize the legal tender and has received the unanimous support of friendly countries. This drop in the legal tender can be said to have been expected by the government, so there is no need to "worry excessively" on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>Second, the conspiracy of Japanese × and traitors to undermine our finances has encountered a relentless counterattack. As mentioned above, the Japanese × and traitors cannot harm our legal tender. On the other hand, the price of the Japanese yen has also continued to fall for several days. Last week, each Japanese yen was only worth 9 jiao 4 fen in legal tender, and yesterday it had fallen to 9 jiao 2 fen. This shows that Japan's difficulties are irreversible.</p>
<p>In addition to firmly supporting the government's belief in resisting Japan and maintaining the legal tender, we must strengthen our friendship with Britain and the United States, and we should also redouble our efforts to crack down on the activities of Japanese × and Wang's traitorous faction in all aspects.</p>
<h3>Aviation Committee Memorial Week, Mao Bangchu Reports</h3>
<p>— Mi Langping</p>
<p>The Growth of the New Air Force, From a Victorious Stalemate to a Victorious Counter-Offensive, The Shortcomings of the First Phase of the War of Resistance Have Been Overcome in the Second Phase, Yang Jingzeng, Director of the Eighth Ordnance Depot, Relates</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Guilin Special Dispatch] A month ago, Director Yang Jingzeng of the Eighth Aviation Ordnance Depot came to Guilin on official business. The reporter learned that his visit was to carry out two major tasks urgently needed by the current Chinese Air Force. At the same time, he also knew that he had recently participated in the Aviation Committee's expanded memorial week in Chongqing. Therefore, after finishing the lecture, the reporter braved the rain to visit his residence.</p>
<p>Director Yang had studied in the United States for ten years and has made many contributions to the organization and distribution of Chinese aviation equipment.</p>
<p>He wiped his glasses first, and then said naturally: "At the recent expanded memorial week of the Aviation Committee in Chongqing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao (Bangchu) specifically pointed out the 'New Trends of the New Chinese Air Force' and had a detailed analysis. I can talk about the main points: Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao said in essence: 'First, the Chinese Air Force was indeed able to fully demonstrate the Chinese Air Force's long-term success, boldness, loyalty, and spirit of sacrifice in the first phase of the War of Resistance. But now we deeply feel that these performances alone, detached from the various important equipment that are closely related, are still not enough. In Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Nanchang, although some basic records were created, they were merely simple expressions of the skills and courage of air combat personnel, or it can be said that they were caused by the cowardice of ×'s air combat personnel (of course, we also have those who are afraid and cowardly, but they are a minority). As for the poor quality of air combat tools—aircraft—(there are also a few that can catch up with ×'s); the difficulty in obtaining oil and bombs, which are not enough to distribute; the poor equipment of airfields; the lack of effort and seriousness of ground air force combat personnel; and the failure to effectively increase the wartime work efficiency of manufacturing and repair factories; the panic in the supply of aviation equipment; the insufficient promotion of political work at the lower level; the non-compliance of all management equipment with regulations; and there are also many other minor shortcomings in various aspects. All of these are major shortcomings that are sufficient to reduce the gains of the first phase of the air war."</p>
<p>Director Yang spoke with great passion and regret, because he was one of the ground air force combat personnel. Although he had tried his best to work hard, he still could not meet the actual requirements, so he said: "To realize the new records of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we must intensify our efforts!"</p>
<p>He took a sip of tea, frowned slightly, thought for a moment, and then said loudly: "I remember Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao continued by saying: 'Second, the new Chinese Air Force has new trends in the second phase of the War of Resistance. We have found more lessons from past failures, and these lessons are the shortcomings that our various departments in the first phase of the War of Resistance neglected and did not have time to do. It is different now. We have overcome the major shortcomings in the first phase mentioned above, and we have actually tried our best to make up for them and correct them as much as possible. (For example, our future air combat tools will be able to exceed the high and low altitude speeds of ×'s aircraft, and they will be more maneuverable and have increased firepower. The number of oil and bomb depots has increased, and specialized management personnel are being trained by hand, and special attention is being paid to transportation in the southwest and northwest. The number of ground air force combat personnel has increased significantly. Just in terms of mechanical technicians, it has increased from several thousand to tens of thousands of people, and foreign inspections and studies abroad have been intensified, and they have consciously and voluntarily made and corrected efforts. The number of aviation factories and monthly repairs has also greatly increased. Although no manufacturing plants have been added, they have been able to make further imitations and self-sufficiency. The number of various fuselages has increased from several to several per week. The number of aviation equipment depots has also increased, and transshipment agencies in Vietnam and Burma, as well as electric refueling trucks, have been added. The large-scale purchase and increase of airlift aircraft and automobiles, the increase in working hours, the unfolding of efficiency, and the rapid promotion of political work, and even the active improvement of various equipment, although slightly changed due to the expansion of the war zone, are all established facts. We believe that it is equally important to promote the experience gained from victory, and it is not enough to overcome and correct shortcomings. Intensifying the recruitment and training of air combat personnel in various departments, actively strengthening and improving combat technology, and promoting the spirit of loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice are also ironclad facts before us. Therefore, the new Chinese Air Force in the second phase of the War of Resistance has also embarked on a new path along with the shift of the war situation and the needs of the times. It can also be said that from the victorious stalemate period to the victorious counter-offensive period is a more active, more effortful, and more arduous period for the new Chinese Air Force. We must recognize the war situation, grasp the war situation, recognize the importance of the mission, the arduousness of the task, and recognize the spirit of self-loyalty and sacrifice. Now is a rare and great opportunity to cash in, and all our air force personnel should create newer records with the greatest determination and belief!"</p>
<p>Director Yang stopped suddenly at this point, looked at his wristwatch, and said: "It's 11:35. There are originally many important things to talk about regarding the Air Force and the War of Resistance, but due to time constraints, fortunately there are many opportunities to meet, so let's talk about it next time." Finally, he said: "We must be fair and honest, are we worthy of the country, the nation, and our own conscience!" (Salvation Society Agreement)</p>

<h3>Visiting the Buddhist Holy Land of Tar Monastery (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jun Sui</p>
<p>When we came out of the hall, we saw an ancient tree, surrounded by wooden fences, with intertwined roots and an old posture. It is said to be a "Sandalwood Tree," and Tsongkhapa's afterbirth is buried under the tree. It is also said that the tree branches and skin are transparent, and Tibetan scriptures appear inside, which is just an old legend. To its left is a temple, with statues of gods in male and female embracing positions. It is said that the Tibetan name of the god is "Jiao," which is the same as what I saw in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing. Beijing people call it the Joyful Buddha, and some say that it is specifically for instructing the young emperor to know the posture of sexual intercourse, which is also unfounded. It is said that this is a deity of Tantric Buddhism, probably taking the meaning of "Don't be surprised by strange things, and the strangeness will defeat itself." Going upstairs next to the hall, we saw two rows of Lamas sitting cross-legged, chanting sutras that could be heard clearly. The paper of the sutras was very thick and strong, and it is said to be produced in Tibet. It is shaped like a belt, about two feet long and six inches wide, with scriptures printed on both sides and surrounded by black lines, comparable to Song Dynasty editions. Entering another room, we saw an old Lama monk holding bells and chimes, chanting as he struck them, the sound shaking the roof tiles. To the left was the treasure throne where the Panchen Lama sat, shaped like an old-fashioned Shanghai carriage, but the whole carriage was painted yellow, and the cushions were all made of yellow satin. Because it was locked, we could not see it clearly. After going downstairs, we went up the ladder again to see the gold ornaments on the roof, some shaped like pagodas, some shaped like umbrellas, and some shaped like bottles, all steel-plated with gold, dazzling to the eye. Looking around on the roof, we saw on the left side of the mountain, towering buildings connected to the clouds, standing on the horizon, knowing that it was the living Buddha's residence, like the mansions of nobles. The living Buddha lived in luxury, truly worthy of the honor of a commoner king. To the right of the mountain was the residence of the Lama monks, with thousands of buildings, lined up close to each other, accommodating about five thousand people. Looking down from the right corner of the roof, we saw the Lama monks gathering in the square in front of the lecture hall, studying the classics, the sounds of questions, answers, clapping when judging, and the echoes of the listeners, noisy and clamorous, debating in groups, no different from the symposium of an academic group. After coming down from the roof, we visited their kitchen again, with three large iron pots one zhang in diameter in the middle, and countless tea buckets beside them, which are said to be used to cook tea and distribute it to guests during incense meetings.</p>
<p>When the visit was about to end, the Second Master invited us to their Guben Jiwa (i.e., office) to rest and have tea and snacks. When we arrived, the so-called First Master and Third Master were also present, and they entertained us warmly, serving tea with great respect. They had baked pot cakes shaped like bread, some with cream added, which tasted very delicious, and there was also a kind of fried noodles, like fried rice noodles in the South, mixed with cream and sugar, which was difficult to swallow. The tea tasted good, but adding cream and sugar made it tasteless. I asked the Lama monk who was serving tea for plain tea to quench my thirst, and I could drink five or six cups in one go, because I had been running around for a long time during the day, and I was very thirsty, so I felt that the tea tasted even more fragrant. At this time, the Second Master agreed to invite the reincarnated Dalai Lama out to meet us. While we were waiting for this future Living Buddha, we chatted casually with the Second Master and others, and they told us about the origin of Tar Monastery and their organization. They established three academies of Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma purely for Buddhist research institutions. The Neizheng Ge Xi Yiwai (translated as Sage) presides over the affairs of the three academies, with a Dharma platform below him, translated as Dean of Education, who is in charge of education, and a Ge Kui Yiwai (translated as Director of Discipline) who is in charge of managing the behavior of all the Lamas in the monastery. If they violate the precepts, they will be whipped with this leather whip, which hangs next to the Great Golden Tile Hall, and it is frightening to see it. It is said that the Living Buddha was also taught the classics by the Dharma platform when he was young, and if he made mistakes, he could also be given a slight Xia Chu, but before punishment, the professor must first bow and pay respects, so the little Buddha was always trembling and at a loss whenever the professor knelt down, which is a strange story. After a while, a Lama came carrying the little Buddha on his back. When asked, he was only four years old. It is said that his father was addicted to alcohol and good at riding, and did not take care of his family's livelihood. His mother had foresight, so the little Buddha's character was very clever. Although he did not know Chinese, the Second Master told him to shake hands with us as a courtesy, and he had no ordinary childishness. I took a photo of him, and he had no fear. The Second Master asked him questions, and the little Buddha answered fluently. According to the Second Master, the Dalai reincarnation is that the three major monasteries in Lhasa, Tibet, send people to visit everywhere. All smart children in Qinghai, Tibet, and Xikang who can select the real objects from the counterfeit products in the utensils used by the Living Buddha before his death are selected. However, the three little Buddhas must still be determined by drawing lots by senior Lama monks, so it is rumored that wealthy families bribe their fathers and brothers to seek their children to inherit the Living Buddha.</p>
<p>We met the little Buddha and said goodbye. We still took a car back to our residence, passing through the Little Golden Tile Hall in the temple, and went down to visit the army. We saw that the hall had two floors, and the copper roof was plated with Kui, echoing the Great Golden Tile Hall, but the scale was smaller than the Great Golden Tile Hall, but it formed its own pattern, and the architecture was also extremely magnificent. Inside, there were Buddha statues, hideous and terrifying, and the smell of greasy oil was unbearable. We didn't look at it in detail. Behind the Little Golden Tile Hall, there are eight small mountains, which are said to be where Nian Gengyao killed eight Lama monks during his expedition to the west, so eight pagodas were built to commemorate them. In fact, Buddhism takes the perfection of eight kinds of merits as its highest goal, and many Buddhist temples build eight pagodas in front to symbolize the eight virtues. This kind of legend is really unfounded. On the way, we saw two Tibetan women and asked them to take a photo, and they agreed. A little further away, we met four local women, and I also asked them to take a photo. One woman suddenly rushed to avoid us. Fortunately, with the persuasion of passers-by and companions, she also agreed. It can be seen that even if an old woman or a young girl in Cairo is photographed with a camera, she will not be refused. Including the Mongolian prince and his wife who entrusted me to take photos at my residence a few days ago, I have now obtained images of the four ethnic groups of Mongolia, Hui, Tibet, and Tu, with different costumes, different religions, and very different lifestyles, but they can live together in one place and live in peace, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>Tsongkhapa was a revolutionary of Buddhism, no different from Martin Luther of Christianity. Because Buddhism was introduced into Tibet from India before the tenth century, to its end, the actors used evil arts such as swallowing knives and spitting fire to confuse the world, and smoking, drinking, and prostitution were rampant, and all purity was lost. It was not until Tsongkhapa was born that he shouldered the mission of religious revolution, taking Sakyamuni's compassion for saving the world as the spirit, and advocating purity, non-action, and abstaining from worldly indulgence as the precepts. He was born in the fifteenth year of the Ming Dynasty Yongle, in Xining, and died in the fifteenth year of Chenghua, in Lhasa, Tibet. After his death, his disciples, Dalai, Panchen, and Jebtsundamba, etc., passed on his clothing and efforts to raise money to build this Tar Monastery. The Mongolian and Tibetan people were extremely faithful to Buddhism, and Tsongkhapa's disciples reorganized the precepts, so they were admired by the public, making Tar Monastery the third holy land of Eastern Buddhism. All Mongols who believe in Buddhism take a visit to Tar Monastery as their lifelong wish, while the Mongolian and Tibetan people of Qinghai take a visit to the three major monasteries in Lhasa, Tibet as their supreme honor, and the Mongolian and Tibetan people of Tibet regard a pilgrimage to Sakyamuni's holy land as their greatest blessing and wisdom, which is nothing more than the mentality of "a monk from afar can chant sutras."</p>
<p>On our way back, we couldn't help but think of many questions, and we felt that the general public's misunderstandings and misconceptions about Tar Monastery were really incredible. For example, saying that their property is enough to compensate for the Boxer indemnity and more, they misunderstand the copper tiles plated with gold as pure gold roof tiles. Some say that if the Living Buddha's reincarnation can be elected from the candidates in Qinghai, then Outer Mongolia and Tibet can be annexed, which is again a misconception that the Living Buddha is still enough to rule Mongolia and Tibet. Others say that Lamaism is not Buddhism, and that the four sects of Black, White, Red, and Yellow are divisions of Lamaism, but they do not know that Lama is the Tibetan translation of Living Buddha, and can only be regarded as a sect of Buddhism, not that there is a separate Lamaism outside of Buddhism, and there is no reason to divide into sects by color. Tibetan Buddhism before Tsongkhapa had reached a state of decay and corruption, and if there was no revolutionary spirit to rise up and reform it, it would have been exhausted like a woman. This is a sect that replaces the old with the new, and it is also necessary to clarify the misunderstanding that it is their religious name. The majority of the Mongolian and Tibetan peoples have been living a nomadic life for thousands of years. The people do not know and do not know, and there is no opportunity to be educated at all. They only rely on becoming a Lama monk to have the opportunity to study the classics and learn to read, which is similar to the scholars in European monasteries in the Middle Ages. Before the government can generally improve the lives and education of the Mongolian and Tibetan peoples, the attempt to break their religious beliefs is also too early of a misconception.</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Reports British Sends Representatives to the Soviet Union To Continue British-Soviet Negotiations, French Side Acknowledges Smooth Success</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 7th] Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons today, saying that the Foreign Office has sent a representative to the Soviet Union to continue British-Soviet negotiations. The Prime Minister said that after the final exchange of views between the British and Soviet governments, they have reached a general common ground, aiming to reach the original goal. The British government has done its best to satisfy the Soviet government, and the British government is prepared to establish an agreement on the basis of complete reciprocity. Military assistance discussed by the three parties is not intended to be completely limited to attacks encountered by the three countries' homelands. In other respects, the Prime Minister hopes that the three countries can reach a common compromise. The Prime Minister concluded that, "It is impossible to offer guarantees to countries that do not need them."</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations May Successfully Conclude; British and French Military to Confer on Cooperation; French Cabinet Studies Soviet Counterproposal; Britain Drafts New Proposal</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, July 7] Regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance negotiations, the British and French sides have been discussing matters in London and Paris for several days. The French Cabinet has now formulated several new tacit agreements for the British side to consider, and then to issue an Anglo-French counterproposal to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, July 7] Britain has drafted a proposal that is expected to satisfy the Soviet Union's request to guarantee its northwestern borders, while specifically avoiding mentioning Estonia, Finland, and Latvia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, July 7] Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a detailed report on Anglo-Soviet-French relations at yesterday's State Council meeting. Cabinet members conducted a thorough study of the new Soviet counterproposal and sought a compromise solution acceptable to both Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain and France are continuing to exchange views, and Parisian sources believe that there are no major difficulties in the future of the negotiations and that they can be successfully concluded.</p>
<p>Content of the Soviet Counterproposal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, July 7] It is learned that Britain has drafted a proposal to meet the Soviet demand for guarantees to countries bordering the northwestern Soviet Union, without specifically mentioning Estonia, Finland, or Latvia. A United Press reporter recently obtained the Soviet counterproposal, which stipulates: (1) Article 1: If any European country directly attacks any of the contracting parties, this convention shall immediately come into effect; (2) Article 2: If the contracting parties are drawn into war to maintain the independence of Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, this convention shall immediately come into effect; (3) Article 3: If any other country is subjected to aggression and requests assistance, the three countries shall immediately discuss how to provide technical mutual assistance to stop the aggression. Consultations between the three countries shall not be related to the procedures stipulated by the League of Nations; (4) Article 4: The contracting parties shall consult each other before accepting new obligations; (5) Article 5: The contracting parties shall not conclude separate peace treaties or armistice agreements with other countries; (6) Article 6: This convention shall last for five years and may be renewed upon expiration. According to news agencies, United Press was the first to obtain the full text of the Soviet counterproposal.</p>
<p>Japanese ×× Conspiracies Abound</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, July 7] News from Tokyo states that the Japanese government has decided that unless the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex of Europe, Japan should not accept constraints in Europe, nor should it accept promises from the Axis powers in advance to provide military assistance. The impression among people here upon learning of this is still quite good. However, according to the latest news, the Japanese military faction is still working hard to promote close cooperation between Japan and Germany and Italy. The Japanese ambassador to Italy is known for enthusiastically promoting Axis policies. He is scheduled to return to Japan shortly to promote the conclusion of a Japanese-German alliance to counter the impending Anglo-French-Soviet alliance. In addition, the Japanese military attaché in Germany will come here to meet with the military attaché in Italy and hold consultations with the military attaché in Britain.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, July 6] Today's cabinet meeting, after a meeting of senior statesmen, discussed in detail the policy measures to deal with the current European situation. The general public is focusing on the talk published by Konoe in the Asahi Shimbun. Konoe's talk expressed great attention to Japan's European policy. Konoe visited Saionji yesterday to discuss Japan's policy. Konoe told the Asahi Shimbun that he will temporarily remain as Minister Without Portfolio.</p>
<p>Hitler Issues ××</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, July 6] Hitler gave a speech here today to the German troops returning from Spain, saying, "When I heard the cries for help from our people and relatives, I immediately sent ships to protect their lives as much as possible so that they could return to their homeland. At that time, Spain produced a person who represented all its people with his own power. General Franco rose up in time to fight and save his country. Franco suffered international harm until July 1936, when I formally responded to his request and provided assistance. Since then, the National Socialist Party has been active in Spain to establish an independent Spain under Franco's rule. I know that doing so will not only warn Europe but also warn other countries with the same ideas. This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate a common idea, and the international plutocracy cannot understand the movement of this idea. I sent you to rescue an unfortunate country and help a bright patriot save his people from fire and water. You return today, completing this heroic mission. I would like to tell the German people how they should thank you. You have demonstrated the spirit of the Germanic race and won supreme glory. Today the war is over, and I have decided to welcome you back to the motherland as a reward and encouragement. All the German people congratulate you. I would like to thank the army and navy. Your struggle in Spain is a struggle for Germany and a clear warning to the enemy. At the same time, we thank our allied forces. The Italian army fought bravely to resist destruction. Finally, we thank Spain even more. Spain suffered greatly from the war, which you witnessed and experienced, and now it has finally gained freedom and independence. At the moment, we look forward to the Spanish people building a new country under the rule of General Franco as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Will Japan Immediately Join the German-Italian Military Alliance?</h3>
<p>Today's newspaper carries two contradictory pieces of news regarding Japanese foreign policy. First, according to news from Tokyo, unless the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex, Japan is unwilling to sign treaties with Europe. Second, according to the same news, there are various events that prove that the Japanese military is making great efforts to bring Japan closer to Germany and Italy. Even the Shanghai dispatch of the "Sing Tao Daily" claims: Japan has decided to join the German-Italian military alliance, and the three countries will re-sign a secret agreement, the content of which is that Germany and Italy will each transfer a division of troops to China in the name of volunteers to assist Japan in its operations. If the European situation changes, Japan can also go to Europe alone to supplement the manpower of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>This may raise a question in the reader's mind: Is Japan's current foreign policy really going to the stage of immediately signing a German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, or is it still premature? On the surface, this question seems to be just a matter of foreign policy towards Europe, but in fact it is also a matter of internal division. We would rather say that it is a reflection of the struggle between two different forces promoted by the Japanese invasion of China.</p>
<p>We believe that as the machinations among various countries become increasingly acute, the crisis of a world war becomes increasingly mature, and the diplomacy of various countries enters the era of alliance diplomacy, the reckless and adventurous young Japanese military men will of course try their best to promote the realization of the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance in order to expand the situation and suppress the opposition at home. Therefore, on the one hand, the Japanese army in China frequently creates terror against third countries, anti-foreign and anti-British movements, which have recently spread from North China and Central China to South China; on the other hand, the military personnel stationed in Europe are also actively promoting Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance.</p>
<p>But according to our observation, the development of the situation is not so rapid. The stagnation and setbacks of the Japanese invasion of China have made the Japanese political circles feel that it is indeed necessary to change or refresh the China policy. It is no longer successful to rely on recklessness alone. It is particularly noteworthy that yesterday's five-minister conference of the Japanese cabinet passed the policy planned by the senior statesmen's meeting to deal with the European situation. Former Prime Minister Konoe, who had been in decline for a long time, is now active again and is linking up with Elder Saionji everywhere.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in various aspects, the Japanese elder statesmen's faction is indeed very worried about the invasion war against China, and they are trying every means to end the war as soon as possible. Therefore, they advocate appeasing Britain, the United States, and France, and of course they do not approve of rashly joining the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance at present. Some commentators believe that the young military men's reliance on Germany and Italy is also aimed at ending the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, but it must be known that the two divisions of volunteer soldiers from Germany and Italy do not have much effect, and the result is just enough to promote the Anglo-Soviet-French triangular military agreement, and will expand the scope of anti-aggression to the Far East.</p>
<p>Recently, the Hiranuma cabinet attempted to "embrace" the abandoned political parties. The Minseito party also put forward the proposition of "reform," while the right-wing maniacs such as Suetsugu were left behind. I think it is not accidental!</p>
<h3>Siam Changes National Title; Cabinet Resolves to Change to [Sai]; To Be Submitted on the 24th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, July 7] The Siamese Cabinet meeting resolved to change the national title to "Sai," meaning the Land of Freedom, and announced that the constitution must be amended before this matter can be implemented effectively. The motion to change the national title will be submitted to the National Assembly on the 24th of this month, which is the "Revision of Treaty Memorial Day" in Siam. According to Siamese National Party members, the current national name originated from the Dongpu Yuezhai, which used to belong to Siam and is now part of Indochina.</p>
<p>Regarding the Change of Title in Siam</p>
<p>Regarding the change of title in Siam, Mr. Lu Juefei, a famous doctor in Hong Kong, submitted a letter to this newspaper pointing out that the translation of the word "Sai" as "Land of Freedom" is wrong. He wrote this article to correct it and add further explanation.</p>
<p>The original word "Sai" is Thai, formerly translated as "Da," and is the name of the nation written by Qian Luoshi. Two thousand years ago, it moved from the southwestern border of China and scattered in the Mekong River basin. This tribe calls itself "Da Ren". Judging from its physique and lifestyle, it is quite similar to the "Baiyi" in Sichuan and Yunnan. Not long after, the "Mon" people from Myanmar and southwestern Siam moved in and competed with the "Da" tribe. For thousands of years, the Mekong River has become the battlefield for their two factions to compete for supremacy. In the northeastern part of Siam, in the deep mountains and dense forests, there are so-called "rotten wood" Khmirs people, who are actually the remnants of Funan (the ancient country of Xidi'an, now French) and Zhenla (now the French protectorate, named Cambodia). They are the most despised by the "Da" and "Mon" tribes. To this day, the two tribes still regard marrying "rotten wood" people as the most shameful thing.</p>
<p>Although the composition of the Siamese nation still has many other elements, such as Chinese and Malays, the above-mentioned "Da," "Mon," and "rotten wood" are still its backbone, among which the "Da" tribe is more dominant.</p>
<h3>British Submarine Tragedy; Secretary of the Navy Releases Report; Praises the Honor of the Deceased Officers and Soldiers; Construction Company Responds with Donations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 6] Secretary of the Navy Stanhope reported on the Thetis submarine tragedy in the House of Lords today, saying that three electric cables have now been wrapped around the submarine, and air floats are also tied to the side of the submarine. If the weather continues to be good, an attempt can be made to hoist it within 48 hours. Regarding the difficulties encountered by the divers, Stanhope said that the currents there are strong, making it difficult for the divers to stand, and because the submarine is tilted, it is impossible to stand on it. These two points are the difficulties in carrying out the rescue work, resulting in a shocking tragedy. According to the survivors, when the Thetis submarine crashed, the officers and soldiers inside the submarine maintained the best order, showing the best glorious tradition of the British Navy. The other personnel inside the submarine were also like this. Stanhope finally praised the heroic character of the bereaved families of the victims of the submarine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 6] Cammell Laird, the construction company of the Thetis submarine, has donated £5,000 in response to the fundraising campaign launched by the Mayor of London to comfort the bereaved families of the victims of the Thetis submarine.</p>
<h3>The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East</h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>(3) Looking at the internal divisions of Britain, the re-approachment between Britain and Germany is even more distant.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the large pro-German group within Britain is the so-called "Cliveden Set," which represents the interests of the financial community, bankers, aristocrats, and feudal landlords. The figures known as the generals are Halifax, the current foreign secretary, Dawson, the editor of The Times, Lothian, the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, and Garvin, the editor of the Observer. Among these, the few whose names are mentioned above have always been strong pro-German advocates. But now, they have all changed their tune and stood on the anti-German side. Even more noteworthy than these people is Astor, the owner of the Observer, who is in the position of host of the "Cliveden Set," who has changed his attitude. Astor has always been regarded as the German diplomatic agent in Britain, but now he openly advocates that Britain can no longer make concessions. All this is a big change.</p>
<p>In recent days, Prime Minister Chamberlain has been constantly wandering on a two-way street, either with the Soviet Union or simply making concessions to Germany to the end. Each time, from the above-mentioned figures in the "Cliveden Set," he has received advice that is different from the past, that he should no longer succumb to Germany at all. Now, the only person who still retains his original position and advocates continuing the pro-German theory seems to be Wilson, the current adviser to Chamberlain. However, compared with the vast voice of all Britain to unite with the Soviet Union, his voice is not even as loud as the humming of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>However, these only represent a major trend. As for how it will be expressed when it comes to actual individual issues, that is of course another question. For example, what about the issue of Danzig? Now, no one dares to predict what attitude Britain will take. The German side also knows "the change in the attitude of these pro-German people in Britain recently, so in order to save the situation, Ribbentrop, the current foreign minister, who is known as a 'British expert,' dispatched" his confidant Gyr to Britain last week to carry out various activities in the social sphere. As soon as Gyr arrived in Britain, he immediately gathered all the pro-German people in the opposition and in the government to exchange many opinions. However, the effect achieved seems to be not great, and the biggest failure is that the news he spread about the German-Soviet negotiations after Litvinov's departure was immediately solemnly denied by Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the happiness of Foreign Secretary Halifax after Ambassador Maisky's denial, it is clear how much Britain today hopes to approach the Soviet Union and alienate Germany.</p>
<p>(4) The Formal Announcement of the German-Italian Military Alliance and Japan's Retreat Halfway</p>
<p>The existence of the German-Italian military alliance has been around for more than a day, and the recent formal announcement did not cause much surprise. However, what caused a little surprise was Japan's retreat halfway. From Japan's point of view, this move is very unfavorable to itself. Japan, which has repeatedly declared that it wants to create a "New Order in East Asia," and the policy of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty by the United States, Britain, and France, which have emphasized sending "final opinions" to Japan, have in fact cut off the possibility of compromise. Does it already intend to admit defeat and prepare to abandon the so-called "New Order in East Asia"?</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not the case. In today's Britain, the prevailing explanations seem to be only two: (1) the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific; (2) the success of China's resistance war.</p>
<p>According to the news obtained here, Japan had originally agreed to send its navy to the Mediterranean to demonstrate. Later, seeing the tough attitude of Foreign Minister Ciano, who was responsible for the negotiations, Japan suddenly became afraid. Of course, it was afraid of making a mistake and truly starting a war with Britain, the United States, and France. So it hesitated, which caused its ambassador to Italy to almost resign in anger.</p>
<p>However, this absolutely does not constitute a reason to withdraw from the military alliance. Japan does not dare to fight against China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. In fact, at present, Germany and Italy do not have the courage to do so.</p>
<p>Of course, Britain still wants to separate Japan from the aggression group. However, Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union and China has other considerations and will not fundamentally change because of this move by Japan.</p>
<p>This move by Japan, apart from chilling the hearts of Germany and Italy, seems to have little other influence. Its already isolated position is even more isolated. From the perspective of diplomatic application alone, this is really a very meaningless and very flustered look for itself. However, judging from various symbols, this retreat is only temporary. If it does not admit defeat and insists on creating some "New Order in East Asia," then, the trend of the times is that even if it knows that joining Germany and Italy is a risk, it will eventually be drawn in.

<h3>Chinese Representatives Respond to Factory Association: Authorities Have Not Ordered Factory Relocation; Four Representatives Agree to Forward Concerns to Hong Kong Government for Reference</h3>
<p>It was reported in the newspapers a few days ago that the government authorities had decided to improve the urban area and had designated King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Ma Tau Kok and Cheung Sha Wan in Kowloon as industrial zones, requiring all factories to relocate within the year. Factory managers were alarmed upon hearing this news and filed complaints with the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, urging them to find a way to remedy the situation. The association then convened a council meeting to discuss the matter. Everyone agreed that if the newspaper report was accurate, it would not only result in significant losses for the factories but also create insurmountable obstacles. It was decided to send a letter to the four Chinese representatives to convey the situation, explaining everything to the government authorities. Yesterday, a reporter visited the director-general of the association regarding this matter. According to him, the association had received a letter from the four Chinese representatives informing them that the Hong Kong government had not made any proposals regarding the designation of industrial zones. Therefore, the newspaper report from a few days ago was not factual. The association's letter to the four Chinese representatives and the representatives' reply are transcribed below.</p>
<p>Worried About Relocation</p>
<p>The association's letter to the four representatives, addressed to Sir Lo Yuk-ho, Mr. Chow Tsun-nin, Mr. Lo Man-kam, and Mr. Tam Ah-shi, stated: "With respect, it was reported in the newspapers yesterday that the authorities had decided to improve the urban area, establish a City Design Ordinance for 1939, and organize an Urban Improvement Design Committee. After the implementation of this ordinance, the first step would be to designate different areas as residential, industrial, or commercial zones. We have heard that the industrial zones have been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon. Factory managers in Hong Kong were alarmed upon hearing this news and have been inquiring about the truth of the matter, fearing that if it becomes a reality, the original factories will suffer unlimited losses, and closure will be inevitable. We immediately convened a meeting to discuss the matter and felt that you, as representatives of the Chinese community, share our concerns and are close to the government authorities. Therefore, we will convey the public opinion of the association to you, as follows:"</p>
<p>Six Reasons Against Relocation</p>
<p>"(1) There are over a thousand factories of all sizes in Hong Kong. The three industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report would be difficult to accommodate them all. Furthermore, due to the impact of the war, transportation is inconvenient, and building materials are scarce and extremely expensive. It is practically impossible to construct or supply a large number of factories for the relocation of the original factories in a short period of time. (2) The cost of self-construction ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the content must be factory-style. Once they are ordered to relocate, renting from others will not be applicable. Who will be responsible for the losses? (3) The construction costs of established factories, such as the installation of water and electricity, the assembly of machinery, and all labor and materials, range from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. If they are ordered to relocate, the original construction costs will be sacrificed, and a huge new construction cost will be incurred. In addition to this, the relocation costs alone will be considerable, which is beyond the means of most factories. (4) The establishment of each factory must have been approved by the government. If they are ordered to relocate, the government will inevitably lose credibility, and the factories will suffer losses without compensation. (5) Factories that manufacture dangerous goods were ordered to relocate to the government-designated dangerous zone last year. However, the industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report do not include the dangerous zone. This means that these factories will have to relocate again in such a short period of time. The losses to the factories are indescribable, and the government's inconsistent policies will inevitably be criticized and leave manufacturers at a loss. (6) Hong Kong has been a transshipment port for a century and is now changing its old appearance. The construction of factories is increasing rapidly, and it is possible to become an industrial port. However, the capital of Chinese factories is meager compared to Europe and the United States. Therefore, the government authorities should support and protect them, allowing them to grow, and should not impose harsh restrictions that make it difficult for them and hinder the development of Hong Kong's industry. Otherwise, those who come to Hong Kong for industry will inevitably go elsewhere, which will affect the prosperity of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Requesting the Government to Delay Implementation</p>
<p>"The above are the reasons why our association members oppose relocating to the industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report. We respectfully request that you inquire with the government authorities about the truth and convey the situation below. We would be extremely grateful. As for the proposal to establish industrial zones, it is certainly a good intention, but we also ask the government to adopt a gradual approach, allowing existing factories to remain in their original locations and requiring new factories to be established in designated industrial zones, gradually improving the situation, so as not to undermine the government's credibility, and the original factories will not suffer huge losses. This is what our members hope for with our humble sincerity. We hereby send this message and respectfully wish you good health. Ye Lan-quan, Chairman of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>The Government Has No Such Motion</p>
<p>The four Chinese representatives replied: "Chairman Lan-quan, With respect, we acknowledge your letter, which quoted the newspaper report from yesterday that the authorities had decided to improve the urban area and that the industrial zones had been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon, and listed four points of the proposal, requesting us to inquire with the government about the truth and convey the situation. According to our understanding, the Hong Kong government has not made any proposals regarding the designation of industrial zones. However, the various points mentioned in your letter are precautionary measures, and we have conveyed them to the government for reference in implementing municipal facilities. Respectfully, Lo Yuk-ho, Chow Tsun-nin, Lo Man-kam, Tam Ah-shi."</p>
<h3>French Envoy Gosselin Has Departed for Haiphong, then to Chongqing</h3>
<p>According to sources, French Envoy Gosselin took the "Pique" to Haiphong before going to Chongqing. He will not be stopping anywhere along the way, therefore he won't be visiting Hong Kong. It is estimated that he will arrive in Haiphong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Entrance Exams for Free Government School Placements Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The exams for free placements in Hong Kong's government-run boys' schools were held yesterday afternoon at the government-run Chinese Middle School. A great many students participated. The exams for free places in government-run girls' schools are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday of this week at Belilios Public School.</p>
<h3>Another Robbery!! Gunshots Ring Out on Tai Po Road; Police Detectives Encircle and Arrest Three Robbers; Shots Fired in Vain; Failing to Escape, All Were Captured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Kowloon detectives received a tip that a gang of thieves intended to commit robbery somewhere in the New Territories. Upon receiving the report, the police station dispatched Detective Inspector Beeby, along with several Chinese and Western detectives, to investigate. At 9:00 AM, they arrived at Tai Po Road and ambushed the area around the "Three and a Half Mile Stone" area. After waiting for two hours, around 11:00 AM, they spotted several men with suspicious appearances walking along Tai Po Road. The detectives ordered them to stop for inspection. Upon hearing the detectives' orders, the men immediately turned around and fled, scaling the walls on the side of the road and running down the hillside. While escaping, they appeared to be drawing their guns. Inspector Beeby led the detectives in hot pursuit and, realizing that the men intended to draw their guns and resist arrest, fired three shots at them as a preemptive measure. One man was immediately shot in the foot and injured. The other detectives also opened fire at the fleeing men, but missed. Inspector Beeby and the detectives continued their brave pursuit and eventually captured two of the men who were unable to escape. The remaining men escaped. After capturing the two men, the detectives searched the area and found two handguns. The detectives then took the injured man and the two captured men back to the police station for investigation. The man wounded by Inspector Beeby was sent to the hospital for treatment and then placed under police guard. It is understood that the men were carrying weapons and seemed to have some kind of plan. Unexpectedly, the detectives discovered their scheme and captured them. When the detectives were chasing them, the men initially wanted to open fire and resist arrest. However, due to a sudden malfunction of the gun mechanisms, the bullets jammed and could not be fired, so they had no choice but to abandon their weapons and flee. Otherwise, a fierce battle between the police and bandits would have been unavoidable. After the incident, the detectives carefully inspected the recovered handguns and found that the bullets were indeed jammed. The police are now preparing to charge the three men.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery Case on Des Voeux Road: Suspect Interrogated Yesterday Morning; Liu Wenzhu Charged with Illegal Possession of a Firearm and Attempted Robbery; Suspect Still Recovering from Injuries, Judge Orders Remand for One Week</h3>
<p>Liu Wenzhu, 31, the suspect wounded and captured by Chinese Detective Tam Song in the sensational armed robbery and murder of a bystander and a detective in Li Yuen East Street, was charged by Chief Detective Inspector Hockin in the Central Magistracy presided over by Justice Edwards yesterday morning with two counts: 1. Attempting to rob Zhang Dazhi on Li Yuen East Street on June 5; 2. Possessing a handgun and five rounds of ammunition without a police superintendent's license. The case caused a sensation throughout Hong Kong on the day it occurred. People in Hong Kong were eager to see the face of the fierce bandit who dared to rob passersby and resist arrest by firing a gun in broad daylight in the prosperous Central district. Therefore, the courtroom was extremely crowded with spectators. When the defendant Liu Wenzhu was brought into the dock, he was wearing a white shirt, his head was bandaged due to an unhealed wound, and there were bloodstains on his clothes. He looked quite haggard. After the clerk read out the charges against the defendant, the Chief Detective Inspector asked the judge to remand the case for one week before further questioning. The judge granted the request. It was also learned that Chinese Detective Yin Wen, who bravely captured the thief on the day of the incident, was shot in the abdomen and seriously injured. After being taken to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment, his condition had not improved by yesterday morning and had even worsened slightly, raising concerns about his life.</p>

<h3>Tan Ah-shi Explains Yesterday: Reason for Banning Pig Farming in Kowloon; Urban Areas Expanding Outwards, Animal Husbandry Hampers Hygiene; Government Considered Before Implementing the Ban; Continued Animal Husbandry Still Possible in New Kowloon and the New Territories</h3>
<p>The health authorities' decision to ban pig farming in Kowloon by September 30 of this year has sparked a reaction from hundreds of local farmers, who have recently hired lawyers and sent representatives to the authorities to appeal, requesting that the order be withdrawn in order to maintain their livelihoods. Details of the situation have been reported in the newspapers. After receiving the farmers' petition, the health authorities realized that the farmers had many misunderstandings and did not fully understand the government's ban on livestock farming. At the same time, the health bureau's Chinese councillors, Tan Ah-shi, Chow Sik-nin, Tang Siu-kin and Wong Ping-yiu held a meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the government's ban on pig farming in Kowloon and the farmers' request for withdrawal in detail. Regarding the points misunderstood by the farmers, the Chairman of the Health Bureau, Mr Todd, specifically commissioned the Chinese councillor, Mr Tan Ah-shi, to give a detailed explanation to reporters, in order to dispel doubts and facilitate the progress of the government's administration.</p>
<p>Close to Urban Areas; Affecting Hygiene</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters yesterday, Councillor Tan first explained the reasons why the government is implementing the ban on pig farming. He said that in recent years, Hong Kong has become increasingly prosperous with the progress of the times, especially with the rapid increase in population, and the suburbs have gradually expanded outwards. Kowloon, in particular, has made great progress. Areas that were once barren have now been transformed into tall buildings. As a result, pig farmers in Kowloon are gradually approaching urban areas. Because the grazing, excrement, and feed of all livestock have a great impact on the health of residents, the government authorities, in order to adapt to environmental needs, have adopted a policy that is not easy for the development of urban areas. Residents' hygiene should have complete protection. On the other hand, the farmers in the Kowloon area have lived and grown up there and have a long history in Kowloon. Once they are banned, their livelihoods will be affected. Therefore, the ban has been carefully considered. As a result of weighing the pros and cons, it was finally decided that it would be more appropriate to relocate the farmers. Therefore, there was a proposal to implement the ban by September 30 of this year.</p>
<p>Banning Animal Husbandry; Only Within Designated Areas</p>
<p>As for the locations where the ban will be implemented in the future, it is not as reported in the newspapers that all farmers in the Kowloon area will be banned, because the geographical division is very clear. The banned area only belongs to the Kowloon area, and its scope is south of Boundary Street. Within the banned area, farmers, whether or not they have licenses, are not allowed to raise livestock. The authorities have also recently decided not to issue any more licenses, as a preliminary step in implementing the ban. As for the area north of Boundary Street, which also belongs to the New Kowloon area, those who have licenses can continue to raise livestock after the ban is implemented. Farmers who hold old licenses can also exchange them for new licenses on schedule, but when the license holder changes jobs, they cannot transfer the license to others. Violators will have their licenses canceled by the government. As for the New Territories, the government has not imposed any restrictions. Livestock can be raised in any area, as a fallback position for the relocation of farmers in Kowloon.</p>
<p>Government Ban; Based on Regulations</p>
<p>Mr Tan further explained that the government is implementing the ban based on Article 15 of the 1935 Public Health and Cleansing Ordinance, which was approved for implementation in September 1938. This ordinance is also closely related to the history of the Health Bureau. Before 1938, the Municipal Health Bureau was originally the Cleansing Bureau. Later, it was reorganized into the Municipal Health Bureau. After this reorganization, the regulations were slightly changed. Since 1935, Article 15 of the Health Regulations regarding animal husbandry (including raising pigs, cattle, and sheep) has also made detailed provisions. The distance between the pigsty and the house must not be less than six feet. The ditches in the pigsty must not be connected to private or public ditches. The building materials of the ditches should be brick, stone, or materials that have been tested and approved. The pigsty must have adequate light. The floor of the pigsty should be paved with stone or covered with cement or impermeable materials, and the ditches must be connected to a water well. The water well must also be approved by the authorities. However, the authorities can be flexible in handling this point based on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Animal Husbandry Locations; Must Be Cleaned</p>
<p>The regulations also stipulate the location for raising cattle. Each cow must occupy 32 square feet of space and have 360 cubic feet of air space. The height of the cowshed must be 12 feet. Each sheep must occupy 8 square feet of space and have 90 cubic feet of air space. Each pig must occupy 8 square feet of space. The minimum height of the pigsty is 4 feet. In addition, all places and houses for raising pigs and sheep should be thoroughly cleaned twice a year. No other items should be stored in the pigsty at the same time. If the license holder is not residing in Hong Kong, their authorized agent must be responsible for reporting to the government veterinary officer, the health bureau, or the police station if livestock are infected with an epidemic. If livestock die of disease, they must not be moved without permission. They must be moved or buried with the approval of the veterinary officer. If the license holder violates the above regulations and is punished more than twice, the authorities have the right to revoke their license at any time.</p>
<p>Designated Areas; For Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Farmers without licenses must have a clean water source near their livestock farming area and wash the farm frequently. The cattle or sheep they raise cannot be released to graze in the grassland without permission. However, this does not apply to lambs and pigs. As for the number of pigs, cattle, and sheep, two cattle that are one year old or older are counted as one head, and two lambs or goats or two pigs that are under four months old are counted as one head. Finally, Mr Tan said that before the government implemented the ban on pig farming in Kowloon, it had designated five areas for farmers to bid for as livestock farming locations: (1) Tsing Yi Island, (2) Ma Wan Island, (3) Tsuen Wan, (4) Kwai Chung, (5) the New Territories. The above five locations have abundant water sources and ample air, making them very suitable for livestock farming. Farmers in Kowloon can seek new locations in these areas and do not need to pay too much attention to the old locations. According to the authorities' accurate investigation, there are approximately 300 farmers without licenses in Kowloon, of which approximately 100 are in Old Kowloon and approximately 200 are in New Kowloon. Therefore, the number of people who will be considered to have difficulties when the government implements the ban is only the 100 unlicensed farmers in Old Kowloon. It should not have a significant impact on the general social problems.</p>

<h3>The War on Hainan Island is Increasingly Advantageous to Us; Counterattack on Lehui Nears the Suburbs; Fierce Battle with the × for Three Days and Nights, Annihilating Over Two Hundred ×; Eastern Hainan × Harassment at Xiantian Village Suffers Another Heavy Blow</h3>
<p>(Southern Route Express Report) The war on Hainan Island has intensified again recently. The × army, in late May, implemented a so-called "mopping-up policy," attempting to annihilate our security team guerrilla groups on a large scale. Therefore, the battle situation was quite fierce. However, due to the united and heroic fighting of the military and civilians on Hainan Island, and after weeks of hard fighting, the × conspiracy was finally shattered. At the same time, Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the Ninth District, has crossed over to preside over the war on Hainan Island, and the situation is becoming increasingly favorable to us.</p>
<p>Our Troops Approach the Suburbs of Lehui City</p>
<p>The invading × forces, having suffered repeated heavy blows, attempted to launch a large-scale mopping-up operation against us. Starting on May 24th, the × forces from various places in Wenchang, Ding'an, Lehui, and Eastern Hainan, with four to five thousand men, launched an offensive against us. Longtang, Tunchang, Ruimu, Puqian, and Xinyu were all targets of the × mopping-up operation. However, due to our army's elusive strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, and launching surprise attacks on the ×, we were able to recover many important strongholds. Our security team, led by Deputy Commander Luo Lianjun, launched a large-scale counterattack on Lehui from the 27th to the 29th of last month, approaching the suburbs and engaging in a fierce battle with the ×, fighting hard for three days and nights. They are now tightly gripping the suburbs and continuing to advance. In this battle, over two hundred × were annihilated. Our Long Regiment and a certain unit of Liang Brigade's garrison also suffered considerable casualties.</p>
<p>Eastern Hainan × Army Harassment Annhilated</p>
<p>Jiaji City in Eastern Hainan County was once recovered by us, but later, in order to gain a strategic initiative, we withdrew again. On the 30th of last month, the × forces in Jiaji sent out a team of over a hundred men to harass and search for our guerrilla forces. They were ambushed by our army in the Xiantian Village area and were intercepted. The × forces, unable to withstand the attack, retreated along their original route. In this battle, over ten × officers and soldiers were annihilated. On the 31st, the × forces again sent over two hundred infantry and cavalry to plunder and search the villages near Huanggang Shangling. The villagers were accused of being guerrillas and were brutally killed. As for our guerrillas in various places, due to their elusive movements, although the × forces have exhausted all means, they have been unable to annihilate them and are sighing at their own futile efforts.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang × Hastily Builds Fortifications; × Boat Spies on Gaoming Estuary and Opens Fire, Causing Disturbances; Shelling of Tangxia Destroys More Than Twenty Civilian Houses</h3>
<p>(West River Express Report) The × army entrenched in Jiujiang in the lower reaches of the West River, repeatedly plots and its ambition is extremely strong. In recent days, it has again harassed the territory of Gaoming and Heshan counties on the south bank of the West River. However, our strength is strong and our defenses are strict, so the × army has not taken any special actions.</p>
<p>Reinforcements to Jiujiang</p>
<p>According to military reports from the front, the Jiang-Fo Highway has seen frequent × transports recently, with military vehicles traveling back and forth even late at night. It is suspected that the × army is reinforcing Jiujiang from Guangzhou and Foshan. From last month until now, the × army in Jiujiang has increased to a total of 2,000 men. Its units, including the Katano and Takeguchi Village units, are stationed in the Daxu, Shakou, and Heqing areas. On the 4th, over a hundred men were sent to Taiping Xiaxu to garrison, and they are hastily building defensive fortifications, erecting barbed wire, etc., for unclear purposes.</p>
<p>Spying on the Estuary</p>
<p>On the same day, several × military motorboats from Heqing × army patrolled and spied on the Gaoming estuary area in the evening for about 30 minutes. About 30 minutes later, one of the motorboats sailed near the Shiqi Pagoda and rapidly fired dozens of rounds with machine guns at the shore. At the same time, it used searchlights to probe in all directions. Our defending troops, upon receiving the report, believed that the × army was conducting reconnaissance and harassment, so they only strengthened their defenses and did not respond. At about 7 o'clock, those several × boats then sailed towards the Jiujiang Shakou area.</p>
<p>Shelling Heshan Territory</p>
<p>Moreover, the Jiujiang × army, in order to threaten the south bank of the West River, frequently fired shells at the coastal areas of Heshan to create a false impression of strength. It was found that on the morning of the 5th, a × shallow-water warship anchored at Shakou moved downstream and bombarded the villages near the coast of Tangxia, firing dozens of rounds in a row, destroying more than twenty of our civilian houses. The artillery at the Shakou ferry also fired remotely at the Gubut estuary on the afternoon of the same day, intermittently for about thirty minutes, before stopping. After an investigation, there were no casualties on our side, and no shells landed in our area. It was found that the shells fired by the × forces were not live ammunition, but were intended to intimidate and create a false impression of strength.</p>
<h3>Shantou City is Calm; The Shantou Branch of the Bank Has Moved to Chao'an to Operate</h3>
<p>(Shantou Express Report) The situation in Shantou City has been quite tense in recent days. Political and military organs are making wartime preparations. The police station has been working overtime to strictly guard against traitors and spies. However, × planes constantly pass through the area to reconnoiter various coastal areas. Due to the frequent air raid alarms, the people are inevitably somewhat restless. The public order in the city remains good. It has been verified that there has been no increase or decrease in the number of × warships in the Shantou sea, only five. In addition, there are about ten armed fishing boats. The × warships are constantly moving, patrolling Jiao Island and Nanao. The transit transport ships have not docked. The Bank of Communications and the Central Bank had prepared everything a month ago and believed that it was necessary to relocate important items. The Shantou Branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank has recently moved to Chao'an to operate, following the original plan. As of 4:00 PM on the 7th, Shantou City was as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Provincial Wireless Network is Being Planned</h3>
<p>[Shaoguan Express Report] Since Commissioner Zhu Hui took over as head of the Construction Department, he has been actively planning and carrying out various construction projects in Guangdong Province. He now believes that wartime rear transportation is of paramount importance. In addition to stepping up the consolidation of the province's highway trunk lines and long-distance telephone communications, he also plans to establish a province-wide wireless network so that even after the × people destroy our transportation, we can still use wireless communication to transmit messages. A large number of wireless equipment has been purchased, and wireless stations will be set up in various counties and cities in the future to ensure flexible communication.</p>
<h3>We and the × Engage in Artillery Battles in Meishan; × Cavalry Suffers a Major Defeat in Mulang; × Planes Spy on Muzhou</h3>
<p>(Zhongshan Express Report) The Jiang-Yu war has been deadlocked for many days. According to military reports from here yesterday, there were minor engagements on all fronts on the 6th, but no major battles. It is now known that the majority of the × army is concentrated in the Ximen area of Hui City and the Qicha area. Our artillery near Daxiaomeishan engaged in artillery battles with the × forces in the suburbs of Hui City on the morning of the 6th, which ceased at noon. On the afternoon of the 6th, the × forces in Jiangmen sent dozens of cavalrymen to launch a surprise attack on our positions along the Xinhe Road. They were intercepted by our army near Mulang. Our army was extremely brave and engaged the × in close combat with broadswords. More than ten × soldiers were killed, and the invading × forces were defeated. The puppet "Advancement Corps" captured in Muzhou, Xinsha, and other places are now being interrogated separately and sent to a certain place for custody, preparing to find ways to reform them. As for the puppet "Advancement Corps" commander Zhao Shanzhan and chief of staff Li Xinyong, after thorough interrogation, it was approved yesterday by the Fourth War Zone to execute them by firing squad nearby. Also, at 2:00 PM on the 5th, the × plane that crashed in Jiuzisha, Sanjiang, crashed because it was taking aerial photographs and flying too low, and was hit by our army and caught fire. After crashing, the bombs carried by the plane exploded, destroying the entire aircraft. The four × pilots were killed in the plane, their bodies torn apart, a terrible sight. It was reported that on the 6th, × planes were again discovered flying to spy on Zhou, Sanjiang, Yangwei, Xinsha, and other places.</p>
<h3>We are Advancing on Zengcheng, East River; Fierce Battle Unfolds at Shetouling; The × Army is Shaken and a Breakthrough is Not Difficult; Dan Rongpei's Troops Successfully Attack the × Camp in Shitan</h3>
<p>(Dongjiang Express Report) Since our army launched its second attack on Zengcheng and recovered Fuhe, the connection between the Northeast Jiang × army has been cut off. The × forces trapped in Zengcheng are surrounded and attacked by our Northeast armies. The strike force of the Lin Division of the Twelfth Army Group, on the 3rd, joined forces with the Chen Shuying Regiment, which guards the foot of Mount Luofu, and launched another attack on Zengcheng, which was very successful. They engaged in fierce battles with the × forces at Shetouling, Pingfengling, and Lixiao'ao in the vicinity of Zengcheng. Our army used new mechanized artillery as the vanguard to bombard the × positions and cover the infantry's charge. The × forces stubbornly resisted in their defensive positions, and the battle situation was quite fierce. After a stalemate until the morning of the 4th, dozens of × officers and soldiers were killed. The battle is still evolving, but the × forces are already exhausted, the Shetouling position is shaken, and it will not be difficult for us to break through in one fell swoop. Recently, military vehicles of the × army have been traveling back and forth frequently between Guangzhou and Zengcheng, but our guerrilla forces are also active, assisting the regular army in attacking. At noon on the 4th, six military vehicles of the × army, carrying over two hundred × soldiers, were traveling from Longyandong to Beikeng when they suddenly hit a landmine planted by our guerrilla forces near Dabu. With a loud bang, the × vehicles were overturned, and dozens of × soldiers' limbs were scattered in the air, their flesh and blood blurred. The remaining × forces, seeing this, did not dare to advance and retreated in a panic. In this battle, in addition to dozens of × being killed or wounded, two × vehicles were also destroyed.</p>
<p>Also, the First Brigade of Zengcheng Guerrillas, led by Dan Rongpei, has been active along the Guang-Jiu Railway in the areas of Xian, Shitan, and Yao, repeatedly inflicting damage on the ×. In the early morning of the 5th, more than a hundred guerrillas from Dan's brigade suddenly attacked the × camp in Shitan, rushing into the vicinity of the Zenntan Station in the northeast suburbs and throwing handmade grenades at the × camp. The × soldiers woke up and responded in a panic, and a melee ensued. After fighting each other for half an hour, we achieved our objective and retreated while fighting, dispersing into smaller groups. In this battle, more than ten × soldiers were killed, two long guns were captured, and a × armored vehicle parked at the station was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Xiang Hanping Inspects Bao'an</h3>
<p>[Shenzhen Express Report] It is confirmed that General Xiang Hanping, commander-in-chief of the guerrillas, is touring various counties in the East River, inspecting the guerrilla warfare situation in various counties, and strengthening the guerrilla formations in various counties.

According to Xiang, he is very satisfied with the activity of the guerrilla teams in various counties in the East River. At present, various counties in the East River are extremely peaceful.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Orders All Counties and Cities to Conduct Joint Offices, Streamlining Organizations and Dismissing Redundant Personnel</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Express Report) In order to increase administrative efficiency, Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun has implemented joint offices for various halls, committees, and departments directly under the provincial government. The provincial government also issued an order to all county and city governments yesterday, requiring all agencies to conduct joint offices from the date of receipt of the document, and to reduce the scope of each agency's organization and dismiss redundant personnel within the possible scope, in order to save expenses and strengthen administrative efficiency.</p>
<h3>Cholera Epidemic Raging; Numerous Deaths Among Guangdong × Forces; The Defense Force in Humen is Weak</h3>
<p>[Dongguan Express Report] According to people from Humen, there is a severe cholera epidemic among the Guangdong × forces, and many × officers and soldiers have died. In addition, the Guangdong × forces have been losing on all fronts recently, and there have been many casualties, so the × army is very panic-stricken and has transferred rear-area troops to the front lines to fight. The number of troops defending Humen is now less than a company.</p>

Also, when the × forces invaded Muzhou on the 3rd, many of the ferries traveling to Macao and Sanbu turned back.

<h3>The Image Transmitter in America</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Major Cities Set Up Image Transmission Stations</p>
<p>The movement for radio image transmission has been promoted for a long time and has finally been concretely realized in the United States. There are currently twelve cities in the United States that have established image transmission stations to broadcast various programs. There are also as many as six factories manufacturing image transmitters. Its popularity among families is increasing day by day, and it is expected that it will soon eliminate ordinary radios.</p>
<p>The so-called image transmitter is shaped like a floor-standing receiver. The radio antenna is stretched on the roof with fifty feet of copper wire. However, the image transmitter needs to set up a large awning. There is a piece of glass in front of the machine, seven and a half inches long and ten inches wide. There is a gourd-shaped cathode tube on the side. Electrons are emitted from the tube and projected onto the glass to form shadows.</p>
<p>When turning on the machine, the room must be dark. The two buttons on the machine control the sound and adjust the aperture. This refers to the most complete type, which sells for 350 US dollars. There is also a type with images but no sound, which is only worth 125 US dollars. Although the projected scenes are not large, they are very clear. Five or six people sitting three or four feet away from the machine can see them very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The programs in the image transmitter focus on the latest news events, such as the British Emperor's tour of Canada, or changes occurring somewhere on Earth, etc. Either the scenes taken at that time are broadcast, or the news events are narrated using "performance" methods. Secondly, there are sports and recreational programs, and interesting scripts are also the center of broadcasting, such as the Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Sometimes, scenes are also broadcast on airplanes, making people feel as if they are traveling in the sky.</p>
<p>The cost of the image transmission station is very high because just one act of a script requires many set-decorated darkrooms and many technician man-hours. The British broadcast station currently broadcasts programs for one hour a day, and the government subsidizes a total of about one million yuan per year. In the United States, each station broadcasts images for two hours a week, and the expenses are borne by the merchants themselves. They expect to earn back the advertising expenses after they develop in the future. However, because the technology is still underdeveloped, the transmission range of radio image transmission is only 45 miles. It must be improved in the future to be popularized.</p>
<p>The technicians on the image broadcasting station are specially trained. They are different from those on the silver screen and stage because a film or stage play can be done for a year, while image transmission shows are no longer used after being broadcast once, and they need to continuously provide new tricks. Therefore, the development of radio image transmission provides people with new stimulation and also enters a new era in art.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Silver Sea Style is the Most Online</h3>
<p>Yi Hua's Fang Peilin directed and acted in "Three-Episode Incarnation of a Woman". The entire project has been completed. Yuan Meiyun appears in this episode as a jockey, which is very lively. Han Langan and Guan Hongda massage Wang Yang, performing a fragrant and humorous scene that makes people laugh. This film will be released soon.</p>
<p>Tiansheng Company produced "Red Flower Vase," a masterpiece by senior director Zhang Shichuan. The plot is extremely bitter and thorough. The actors include Wang Lan, Shu Shi, Wang Hanlun, Tan Zhiyuan, Bai Yan, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Jingjin, Yi Hua's director, directed "Hong Kong Songstress," which shows great effort. Sun Jing is a new director who loves to use new talents, such as Yue Lin, Tao Na, Yan Hua, Cao E, all of whom are new to the film industry.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong, who wrote, directed, and starred in "Swallow Thief," has reached the end. There are rumors that he will go to Hong Kong, but Wang himself said that he will not leave Shanghai in the short term because Xinhua has invited him to guest star in a film.</p>
<p>Wang Hanlun is a pioneer among Chinese film actresses, with rich acting experience. She plays Wang Lan's mother, a high-ranking official's wife who has been reduced to a servant, in the film "Red Flower Vase." Her performance is full of tears and emotion, worthy of being a senior filmmaker.</p>
<p>Wang Lan, who starred in "Red Flower Vase One," is seventeen years old this year and sings Peking opera very well.</p>
<p>Zhang Cuihong refused to play "Wang Baochuan". Yi Hua has invited Bai Yan to fill the role. There are rumors that Lü Baiyang will come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Yang has been very active recently, showing a great determination to move forward, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian's younger sister, Yueleng, will have a stunning performance in Zheng Xiaoqiu's "One Night Pearl."</p>
<p>Rumors have spread that Wang Xianqi's wife is heavily pregnant, but in reality, Wang's wife's belly has not changed at all.</p>
<h3>All Countries Attach Great Importance to Children's Films</h3>
<p>Film has been recognized as a quick way to supplement children's education. Therefore, countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. The fourth of this month is Children's Day. Therefore, the author would like to briefly report to readers on the importance that various countries attach to children's films.</p>
<p>America</p>
<p>The United States is an advanced country in the film industry. Therefore, film education in the United States is also more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States now have projection equipment and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some of these films are specially filmed by the government collecting materials and writing scripts. Some are filmed by film companies, specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas screen films with educational significance for children. Whenever children go to watch them, the ticket prices are greatly reduced.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>In traditional and somewhat conservative old England, movies are naturally no exception, especially when it comes to children's movies. When examining movies, the film censorship committees in various places mark each film with either an "A" or a "U". "A" is an abbreviation for "Adult," meaning only adults are allowed to watch, not children. "U" is an abbreviation for "Universal," meaning adults and children can both watch. In recent years, the UK has set up a national agency to manage children's films, filming children's films and showing them publicly in public institutions or schools in various places.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy</p>
<p>The two authoritarian countries of Germany and Italy also attach great importance to children's films. However, since the rise of the Fascists, these two countries have successively put the film industry under control, and movies have been used as a tool for propaganda. Political function outweighs entertainment, so children's films are no exception. The government selects the materials for children's films and films them, some explicitly and some implicitly, to promote Fascism, National Socialism, and child propaganda. And various movie theaters and schools often have public screenings of these children's films.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>The progress of the Soviet film industry is extraordinarily rapid, which is enough to surprise anyone. In particular, they pay great attention to film education. Just in Moscow, every holiday, there are more than 500 cinemas that take turns showing children's films from 9 am to 9 pm. The low ticket prices are unseen in other countries. These films, including full-length films and cartoons, are produced by the government and specifically for children ages 8 to 16 to watch. In terms of production, the stories are all aimed at children, which is different from ordinary films.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The South China football team, on its southern tour, arrived in Hanoi and fought two battles with local teams, both of which South China won decisively with scores of 6-0. On the 5th, they moved to Haiphong and faced a combined team. South China invited Song Ling-shing (a star player from Hong Kong's Eastern Athletic Association, who went to Haiphong for work at the end of this football season at the urging of friends) to play. However, because the formation was not complete, they drew with the Haiphong combined team, the result being 2-2.</p>
<p>Cheuk Shek-kam was favored by Manager Mok and included in the team. However, Cheuk felt unwell when departing. Upon arriving in Hanoi, his condition did not improve. Therefore, Manager Mok, for the sake of his personal health, ordered him to return to Hong Kong for recuperation. He arrived in Hong Kong by plane yesterday.</p>
<p>A certain player, using the pseudonym "Heroic Wind," wrote a Southern Tour Diary for this newspaper, which was sent by air mail yesterday. Those who care about the team's southern tour will surely enjoy reading it.</p>
<p>Sailing Out of Port - Great Winds and Waves</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM on May 31st, the Guangdong motorship left Hong Kong. The weather was overcast, with hazy rain and misty fog. Hurricane waves surged, and the ship rocked unsteadily. The comrades had a light meal and then went to their cabins to rest. Manager Mok received a notice from the ship's captain, informing him that the winds and waves would be severe that night, so he instructed all the players to rest early. The scheduled calisthenics exercises for that day were canceled due to the rough seas. Although some comrades had accompanied the team on southern expeditions many times, they still felt overwhelmed by the large waves. Tiger Balm and Pak Kwa Tan became their only companions on the journey.</p>
<p>Calm Seas and Cheerful Conversations</p>
<p>At dawn on June 1st, the comrades got up. The sun shone brightly, and the weather was hot. The huge waves of yesterday were nowhere to be seen. The comrades' spirits were lifted, and they engaged in cheerful conversations. They gathered in the smoking room to chat. Tang Kwong-sam and Kwok Ying-ki sang Cantonese tunes. Others played chess. Chan Chun-fai's outer clothing was soiled, leaving him with only his underwear and long sleeves. Because he was traveling with the army, he had nothing but what he wore. He hoped to arrive in Haiphong soon to buy new clothes and pants. If his teammates refused to lend him clothing, Chan Chun-fai would be forced to practice nudism. Fortunately, the ship would arrive in Haiphong tomorrow, and everything should be resolved. The teammates agreed to go to bed early that night to wake up early and watch the ship dock.</p>
<p>Shek-kam Returns to Hong Kong, Ling-shing Joins the Expedition</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Haiphong became a vital transportation hub for our country, with thriving commerce and a surge in population. Last year, the Eastern Athletic Association and the South Pen Club football teams also visited here. On the 2nd, at six in the morning, everyone prepared their luggage. The ship docked at 7:30 AM. After customs inspection, the entire team went to the Ho Shek Mei Hotel for a brief rest. At noon, they had lunch at the Tao Yuan Restaurant. Compatriots gave the team a warm welcome. After lunch, the team, in response to an invitation from the Hanoi Football Association, had to travel directly to Hanoi on the Messi Ling express train at 1:30 PM for the first match on the 3rd. Coincidentally, Song Ling-shing, a star player from Hong Kong's Eastern Athletic Association, visited Haiphong. Coach Mok strongly invited Song to join the expedition. Song agreed and immediately went to Hanoi with the team. Upon arriving in Hanoi, we stayed at the Grand World Hotel. As instructed by Coach Mok, everyone rested at 10 PM. Those who disobeyed would be severely punished. Cheuk Shek-kam fell ill upon leaving Hong Kong, and his condition did not improve during the voyage. After being sick for seven days, for the sake of his health, it was decided that Cheuk would take a plane back to Hong Kong for recuperation. However, the southern expedition team gained one Song and lost one Cheuk, so there was no loss in overall strength.</p>
<p>First Match in Hanoi - Showing Off Power</p>
<p>The 3rd was the date of the first match of the southern expedition in Hanoi. The match location was at the Racecourse Stadium. The opponent was the Hanoi champion Alan team, a strong team in Hanoi. The match began at 5 PM. Before 5 PM, the audience was extremely crowded, especially with overseas Chinese. Our team fielded a complete lineup and, as a result, showed off its power with a 6-0 victory.</p>

<p>Law Tau-man Lai Siu-wing Chan Tak-fai Fung King-cheung Yeung Shui-yik</p>
<p>Another Victory - Crushing the Combined Team</p>
<p>On the 4th, we fought the Hanoi Athletes team. Because the overseas Chinese were impressed by our team's reputation, the audience was twice as large as yesterday. We played with a heroic attitude and again crushed the Hanoi Athletes team with a score of 6-0. Our team's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Cheung Wing-choi</p>
<p>Lee Tin-sang Hau Yung-sang</p>
<p>Lee Kwok-wai Leung Wing-chiu Kwok Ying-ki</p>
<p>Law Tau-man Lai Siu-wing Chan Tak-fai Fung King-cheung Tang Kwong-sam</p>
<p>Moving to Haiphong - The Game Ends in a Draw</p>
<p>On the 5th, in response to a telegram from the Haiphong Athletes team, we traveled by car to Haiphong for the match. The stadium was uneven, the dimensions were not standard, and the grass was five to six inches long. Coach Mok tried a new formation, with Shui-yik playing on the left wing and Tin-sang resting. The lineup was incomplete, and the game ended in a 2-2 draw. We will take a train to West Buy at 5 PM on the 6th and will arrive in about 40 hours. Strong Vietnamese teams are ahead, and there will be intense battles. The lineup for the match against the Haiphong team was as follows:</p>
<p>Cheung Wing-choi</p>
<p>Lee Kwok-wai Hau Yung-sang</p>
<p>Tam Chun-fai Lau Hing-choi Song Ying-shing</p>
<p>Yeung Shui-yik Lai Siu-wing Fung King-cheung Lau Chung-sang Tang Kwong-sam</p>

<h3>Division B Basketball: International, Chun Fung, and Lai Hang Victorious</h3>
<p>The Division B basketball finals had three games scheduled last night. In the first game, International defeated Wah Hung 36-22. In the second game, Chun Fung won by one free throw, 29-28, over Tsang Ying. In the last game, Lai Hang played against Kwong Chung. Initially, Lai Hang did not go all out and was closely followed by Kwong Chung. After halftime, Lam Yau-pui and Tak Tak-cheung and others displayed brilliant performances, and Kwong Chung became like a spirit under the ax. As a result, Lai Hang won overwhelmingly 59-32. Also, the Basketball Association announced that in the Chun Fung vs. Pui Ying game, the committee members discovered that Chun Fung had used an unregistered player. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened, and the outcome of that game is currently pending, awaiting the referee's report before a meeting can be held to make a decision.</p>

<h3>From Ancient Greece to the Olympic Games</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Greece is the birthplace of European culture. All European religions, arts, philosophies, educations, crafts, sciences, etc., are influenced by the Greeks. This is related to geography. If you open a map of Europe, you will see that Greece is only half an island. Its shape is like the bones of a hand, protruding into the Mediterranean Sea, giving the impression of picking up seeds of various cultures. To the north, the Balkans act as an arm, which is slightly wider, while mainland Greece is only two hundred and fifty miles from north to south and one hundred and eighty miles from east to west, with a total area of ​​only about 20,000 square miles. However, because it is surrounded by the sea on three sides, the climate in all seasons is very mild. Taking the city of Athens as an example, it only snows once every twenty years. Every year from May to September, citizens can sleep outdoors on the streets. Therefore, houses, furniture, and clothing are very simple and unadorned. As for daily life such as farming and labor, most slaves are made to do it, so their education does not necessarily require vocational preparation. Therefore, in a beautiful, purple-sea environment where life is very comfortable, Greeks enjoy a life of beauty. It is not only the center of Greek life, The Ounter P infs of Greek Life, but also the foundation of Greek culture. However, its great cultural development lagged behind the Persian Wars. Afterwards, because they had confidence, they dared to try to explain naturally what was previously attributed to mythology. Therefore, Aristotle Srisotle said, "Since the Persian Wars, people have been proud of their success and rushed forward. All knowledge is a field of activity, and they want to pursue deeper learning." However, although the Persian Wars were the driving force behind the formation of Greek culture, the completion of culture was still blessed by geography. Looking at the map again, the coastline of Greece is quite tortuous. Although there are no high mountains or large rivers, there are many small mountains running vertically and horizontally. Therefore, the terrain is very uneven, sometimes forming mountains and sometimes forming hills. These vertical and horizontal mountains create obstacles, dividing Greece into many isolated regions. In each region, it develops its self-sufficient economic life, independent ruling government, and even different systems, educations, laws, and customs. Each region has two opposing cities, surrounded by cultivated land attached to the city, expanding to the surrounding hillsides. This type of region is called a "city-state," Citg Ates.</p>
<p>These include Euboea, Loerio, Aetolia, Phocts, Boeotia, Achaea, Argolio, Eli, Aroiada, Meceoia, and Lnconiu. Its city is called Sparta Sbunta. There is also Attica AJicn, whose city is called Athens Asbens. Although these many city-states each develop their politics and economy, they compete with each other and are unwilling to give in. Fortunately, they contain a sense of ethnic self-awareness, organize a common religious alliance Amphictiony, and in order to protect temples and worship gods, they launched the Olympic Olympi Games to connect with each other. The above is a brief overview of Greek culture. The following is a description of Sparta and Athens, the hegemons among the allied states.</p>

<h3>China's Cotton Industry Since the War Began</h3>
<p>(Translated from Millard's Review) Birmingham (Continued)</p>
<p>(9) Textile factories that were closed during the war but have resumed operations since last year include: Chongxin in Zhabei, registered under British business, and Ewo Yarns in Yangshupu District, British owned.</p>
<p>(10) The following textile factories whose machinery has reportedly been shipped out by the Japanese include: Hengfeng Textile Company, Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 7, registered under British business, Dihua Dyeing and Weaving Company, all located in Yangshupu, and Zhentai Yarn Factory in Zhabei, also registered under British business.</p>
<p>(11) The following companies were opened in Shanghai after the war began: Anda Textile Company, 15,000 spindles, China Textile Company, 26,000 spindles, 300 looms, China Yarn Factory, 15,000 spindles (all registered under British business), China Cotton Yarn Manufacturing Company, 26,000 spindles, Defeng Textile Company, 10,340 spindles, 128 looms (all registered under American business), Rong Yu Yarn Factory, 10,000 spindles, Hefeng Weaving and Spinning Company, 5,000 spindles, 150 looms, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, 10,360 spindles, Zhaoxing Yarn Factory, 8,400 spindles, Da Yu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Woolen Company, 4,000 woolen spindles, 100 looms.</p>
<p>The machinery of the above factories was either shipped out from inland cities such as Wuxi or purchased and transferred from other textile factories in our area.</p>
<p>Before the war, Japan had 45 yarn factories in China, 32 of which were in Shanghai. It is said that about 7 million spindles in the two factories in Shanghai and the nine factories in Qingdao were destroyed in the war. In order to increase the output of its yarn factories, the Japanese side has decided to install 900,000 spindles in Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai in the near future. Currently, 25 of the 32 Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai are in operation, and most of their products are dumped into occupied areas. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Intellectual Debate</h3>
<p>— Jin Ming</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Sitting halfway up the mountain under a pine tree, inhaling a Douiee Fagle brought from a town ninety miles away, I intend to discuss some trivial matters. Yinglin said:</p>
<p>"...One day, we may be sitting here again, starving to death. Our ancestors didn't leave us anything suitable; it's especially miserable for the intellectuals. Farmers can grow grain, ranchers can manage some cattle and sheep, soldiers can carry weapons, but everyone else will inevitably suffer the same poor fate. The legacy of us intellectuals is not enough to console ourselves. We might as well look at the scenery."</p>
<p>I felt I had nothing to answer. Neither wanting to die nor wanting to live, this is a major flaw in people. Such thinking can only be considered "defeatism" worth less than half a penny, even if such days are indeed possible.</p>
<p>The cultural legacy our ancestors left us, not to mention anything else, is just words, the art of debate, which is enough to inspire people without weapons or resources that their existence is not without meaning. In ancient times, European orators like Demosthenes and Cicero had only one mouth when they were alive, and their legacy after death was just some glory, but their spiritual achievements never ceased, because the so-called 'Creator' intentionally arranged humanity in this way. Humanity itself is also willing to present its final glory to such people, and all they can hope for is this right.</p>
<p>I think, when war destroys everything, destroying all published culture, intellectuals will still hope for a way to "live," leaving the pen and still having a mouth.</p>
<p>In today's society, with the distribution and arrangement of socio-economic thought and material, the mouth probably doesn't have much use. The compassion of citizens and the sympathy of knights in the days of ancient emperors no longer exist. It is impossible to stir up great waves with just a mouth. But compromising and assessing situations, weighing gains and losses, advocating benevolence and criticizing injustice, using strategy and understanding plans—these slightly corrective efforts against absurdities and barbarism will still continue in the modern age and the future. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Qi and Lu record that Wu Zixu met King Liao of Wu, and Liao talked with him for two days, "his words were without repetition," which shows that Wu Zixu still had a mouth even after leaving his weapons. Even when words couldn't move him, he still had wisdom to help Helü achieve his ambition.</p>
<p>The *Poetry Beyond the Tradition* records that Confucius spoke about the art of persuasion with some meaning. Regardless of whether the words truly came from the Wang Ma Zi Old Shop, the fact that the ancestors told their descendants to learn "literature" so that they could live meaningfully is worth appreciating. He believed: "In the art of persuasion, maintain solemnity and dignity, act with integrity and sincerity, stand strong and firm, use apt metaphors, clarify with distinctions, send it forth with joyful fragrance… this ensures that persuasion will always succeed." It seems that such a skillful mouth doesn't necessarily rely on some genius; it is originally obtained through self-cultivation.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Speaking of the skill of argument, many praise Yan Ying. Yan Ying was not as pedantic as the Confucians, nor was he solely focused on power like Su Qin and Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>"Duke Jing of Qi sent Yanzi as an envoy south to Chu. The King of Chu heard of this... His attendants said, 'Yanzi is the most skilled debater in the world. Discussing state affairs with him would be inadvisable. Your Majesty could sit with Yanzi, have an official lead a man from Qi past Your Majesty, and when Your Majesty asks about him, have him say the Qi man is a habitual thief and is being bound for that reason. This should be able to embarrass him.' The King said, 'Good.'... After a while, they led a bound prisoner past. The King said, 'What did he do?' The official replied, 'He is a Qi man who is a habitual thief, and he is being brought to the authorities.' The King laughed heartily and said, 'Qi is a land of hats and belts, a land of scholars. Are they truly prone to thievery?' Yanzi said, '...Has Your Majesty not seen the trees south of the Yangtze? They are called tangerine trees. When planted north of the Yangtze, they transform into trifoliate oranges. Why? It is the soil that makes them so. When the Duke was in Qi, he stood erect in his hat and belt, with the integrity of Boyi; now that he is in Chu, he is prone to wickedness. It must be the transformation caused by the soil!'"</p>
<p>This story is well known, but it is worth savoring again and again. Here are two more examples:</p>
<p>"Duke Jing of Qi was touring atop Niu Mountain, looking north at Qi, and said, 'How beautiful is my state! Lush Mount Tai! If there were no death in ancient times, where would I, the lonely one, go?' He lowered his head and wept, wetting his lapel. State Counselor Gaozi said, 'Indeed. I rely on your Majesty's bounty to be able to eat coarse vegetables and bad meat, and to ride a decrepit horse in a wooden cart, and I still do not wish to die, let alone Your Majesty!' Yanzi said, 'How joyful is my tour today. I see a cowardly ruler and two flattering ministers. If there were no death in ancient times, the Grand Duke would still be alive, and my ruler would now be wearing a straw hat and cloak, standing in the fields, concerned only with worries, with no time to think of death!'"</p>
<p>"Duke Jing of Qi went out hunting at the pool of Zhaohua. Yan Denzhu was in charge of the birds, and one escaped. Duke Jing was furious and wanted to kill him. Yanzi said, 'Deng Ju has four capital offenses. Please let me count them and then execute him.' Duke Jing said, 'Agreed.' Yanzi said, 'Deng Ju was in charge of the birds for our ruler, and one escaped. That is his first offense; for causing our ruler to kill a man over a bird, that is his second offense; for causing the feudal lords of the four kingdoms to hear of it and think that our ruler values birds more than scholars, that is his third offense; when the Son of Heaven hears of it, he will surely demote our ruler, endanger his state, and cut off his ancestral temples, that is his fourth offense. These four offenses deserve death without pardon. I ask to increase his punishment.' Duke Jing said, 'Stop. This is also my fault. I wish for you to apologize on my behalf.'"</p>
<p>Such "intellectual debate" can be said to be truly humorous, much more humorous than the impromptu utterances of Yuan Zhonglang. Of course, in an era of materialism, literary intellectuals disdain the subservient status of the past and therefore despise this kind of debating skill, which is a joke. At the very least, scholars can never be separated from social life.</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu quelled an impending internal rebellion with a clever debate. The unwavering words of Kou Zhun in the Song Dynasty forced the northern barbarians to give up their invasion. These are all effective examples of debating in defense, even though the effects are not always guaranteed, the art of debate itself is still worth appreciating.</p>
<h3>Five Minutes (III)</h3>
<p>— Luo Feng</p>
<p>He Zheng's legs were a little weak, and he timidly moved his heavy feet backward. The shackles suddenly rang, and the sound reminded him—cowardice and avoidance, aren't they just foolish self-deception? At the same time, he thought that under such circumstances, it was absolutely impossible to escape death. Now he even felt that being able to die sooner would be his victory.</p>
<p>One of his hands had already touched the fur of that beast. The fur was short and stiff. He Zheng thought: Tiger? Bear? Why hasn't it made a move yet? Is it asleep? Then he waved his fists wildly, trying to wake it up, accidentally hitting it on the head. Only then did he realize that it was neither a tiger nor a bear, but a horse.</p>
<p>Because of this horse, He Zheng once again had the illusion of escape: lying on the horse's back or sitting sideways, he could ride it to break through the enemy's blockade, escape this barren mountain, and return to his own troops safely...</p>
<p>The horse kept snorting.</p>
<p>Two guards patrolled outside the stable.</p>
<p>He Zheng stood blankly in place, indulging in his fantasy. However, that fantasy just kept rolling around in his heart, rolling around... never getting close to his ideal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strong, unsteady beam of light shot in from outside, dividing into countless white, thick lines by the sparse supports of the stable, sometimes landing on He Zheng, sometimes on the horse, or on the ground.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two guards had stopped patrolling. A lighter step replaced their footsteps, seeming to gradually intensify with the increasing light.</p>
<p>Now He Zheng had stopped his unrealistic fantasy. He completely understood what was coming. He wanted to greet it, but his whole body was too heavy to move a step. So, he had no choice but to offer his young life, waiting for it to seize him.</p>
<p>The large beam of the flashlight completely enveloped him, turning He Zheng into a blind man, unable to see anything. He could only hear the hurried, ruthless tone of the enemy commander, followed by the interpreter's words:</p>
<p>"Have you considered it?"</p>
<p>If not for this reminder, He Zheng would have almost forgotten it.</p>
<p>Within these five minutes, he had considered nothing at all, except for that bit of fantasy about escaping, and was only praying for death, as if only death could bring him supreme comfort.</p>
<p>He Zheng didn't answer the insulting question. He raised his head and walked proudly toward the strong light. Golden symbols flaunted on his bright collar badges. The interpreter translated the commander's words:</p>
<p>"The time has come!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've been waiting for a long time!"</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>From the Old Method of Praising to Criticism</h3>
<p>— Xiaoren</p>
<p>Our usual flatterers always have an old method: they seize on a seemingly good point of the person they are praising and greatly exaggerate it, making people think that this is the entirety of their life's behavior. In the past, those who wrote "epitaphs" and "prefaces" for people played this trick. If the person occasionally gave a poor person a tattered piece of clothing, the flatterer would praise them as a great philanthropist, even though they were actually a parent who had beaten a servant girl to death; if there was a couplet written by someone hanging in their living room, the flatterer would call them "learned," even though they had never actually read a book in their life; even if they had only hired a doctor for their wife once, the flatterer would exaggerate that they had "extremely harmonious relations with their wife," even though they kept seven or eight concubines.</p>
<p>This method is excellent for flattery, because otherwise, the purpose of "praising" would be difficult to achieve. However, this can only be used for "praising." If one were to formally write a critical biography of a person, this method would lead to major problems.</p>
<p>For example, Feng Dao once recited other people's poems in front of the Later Tang emperor to illustrate the hardships of the people's lives. This story is naturally "learned" and "charitable"; but if one only seizes on this point and considers it the entirety of Feng Dao's personality, completely ignoring his focus on holding office and disregard for the state's demise, what kind of critical biography would that be? Think about it! Take another example: Ruan Dacheng was a talented writer. He was not only one of the great playwrights but also an excellent director. His "learning" was without any pretense. But if one only seizes on this side of Ruan Dacheng, praising only his literary achievements while completely ignoring his act of surrendering to the Manchus, what kind of critical biography would that be? Think about it! The opposite would be the same: if one were to assume that Confucius was an expert in picking up women simply because he met Nanzi, that would undoubtedly be a great injustice. This all illustrates that to assess a person, one must look at their major tendencies and draw conclusions based on these tendencies in order to arrive at a definition that can be considered definitive. Similarly, one cannot escape this circle when doing literary criticism.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty painter Wang Su once painted a very good set of pictures on agriculture and weaving. That set of sequential pictures is very famous and can indeed be called one of Wang Su's masterpieces. But should we, based on this, say that Wang Su is a peasant painter? Of course not. Because Wang Su spent most of his life painting the ladies of the upper classes, and agriculture and weaving cannot represent his entire body of work. To critique a literary artist, one must also look at their major tendencies. Otherwise, their face will be distorted. Seeing a few short essays by a Ming Dynasty writer without investigating the author's main achievements and blindly promoting them as a "master of natural genius," even placing a halo on their head to use as a talisman when they are suffering, one can believe that some people will believe it, but in reality, it is just nonsense.</p>
<p>Even when criticizing a single work or essay, one cannot escape this circle.</p>
<p>However, our old method has long been extended to the field of criticism. The so-called "quoting out of context" refers to this type of criticism. One can simply tear off a piece from a work and launch into a tirade of discussion without bothering to study the entire work. This is naturally very enjoyable for the critic, but it is not very good for the work itself. Just by taking the passage about Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian from the *Water Margin*, and labeling the *Water Margin* as "an obscene book," people who have not read the entire *Water Margin* may believe it, but in fact, the *Water Margin* has been "lingchi'd."</p>
<p>However, if this kind of criticism advances further, it becomes "extracting sentences and interpreting them." This is naturally even more enjoyable. One can simply extract a sentence or two from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words and then show off the critic's authority. The brilliance of the method goes without saying, but the result is that it becomes a word game. The critic paints a line of powder on their own nose, and Jin Shengtan used this method to critique the *Water Margin* and other so-called "genius books," but don't we also feel that Jin Shengtan often seems like a clown?</p>
<p>According to the literary evolutionary view advocated by our scholars, this "extracting sentences and interpreting them" will advance to "extracting words and interpreting them." By extracting a word like "no" from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words, one can label it as promoting nihilistic philosophy. By extracting an "alas" from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words, one can label it as expressing pessimism. When critics reach this stage, they have reached a state of complete and utter satisfaction, but "where there is a benefit, there must be a drawback." It is a pity that criticism is sacrificed to accommodate the critic's satisfaction and disappears.</p>
<h3>Rats</h3>
<p>— Yide</p>
<p>If you want to read some books in peace and quiet at night, it's impossible with rats around. There's chattering and noises from the east and the west. Sometimes they even march on the ceiling! It's like "not hearing commands, but only the sound of men and horses moving."</p>
<p>If someone else were sleeping here, they would suspect a "ghost" and probably huddle in their blankets. But I've gotten used to it. I do my own thing because I know these are all the "petty tricks" of rats.</p>
<p>Rats are truly "philosophical" in their understanding of the world. One night, I don't know which child left a steamed bun, so I put it on a stool next to the bed, selected a wooden stick about a foot long, and held it in my hand, thinking that when the rat came, I would give it a "surprise attack." But it didn't work. It seemed to have the "spirit of a human being" and didn't come. When I was prepared, it didn't dare to act.</p>
<p>But humans are civilized. The rat paced back and forth on the desk, while I lay in bed, trying to imitate the roar and posture of a cat, jumping and leaping (actually, it wasn't my feet that were jumping). The bed creaked, but the rat, after all, didn't behave like a civilized person who "judges others by their own standards." "Ha! Trying to scare me?" it seemed to say with a smile, and then it slowly walked away.</p>
<p>Helpless, I had no choice but to put on a show, rubbing my fists and palms. In the cold weather, who wants to come out and meddle in other people's affairs? Isn't it better to sleep in bed? It's just a slight loss of food, and it's disturbing. And the most important thing to be aware of is "throwing something at the rat but fearing damaging the valuables," so I had to tolerate it.</p>
<p>However, this is talking about the past, because my old cat is giving birth to kittens, so she doesn't have the strength to catch rats, and the rats aren't afraid of her. They even dare to walk in and out of the cat's nest. Now our old cat and the newborn kittens are all roaring; many rats have been bitten to death, and they will soon disappear.</p>
<h3>Returning Dream</h3>
<p>— Luo Pin</p>
<p>A boat travels on the river</p>
<p>Watching the rolling yellow waves</p>
<p>Lofty mountains and plains</p>
<p>Lining the river and sky</p>
<p>Last night I docked at Luokou</p>
<p>Listening to Shao's boat songs</p>
<p>Fishing boat lights on the riverbank like a camp</p>
<p>On the small path, drawn</p>
<p>A blue lantern</p>
<p>Gamblers go home drunk</p>
<p>Tonight I rest</p>
<p>By the ancient fortress at the foot of the mountain</p>
<p>In a midnight dream</p>
<p>I hear the rooster crow at dawn</p>
<p>The sound of clappers and pestles</p>
<p>A refugee's returning dream.</p>
